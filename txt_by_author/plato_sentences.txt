INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS
THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO IS THE LONGEST OF HIS WORKS WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF THE LAWS AND IS CERTAINLY THE GREATEST OF THEM
THERE ARE NEARER
APPROACHES TO MODERN METAPHYSICS IN THE PHILEBUS AND IN THE SOPHIST THE
POLITICUS OR STATESMAN IS MORE IDEAL THE FORM AND INSTITUTIONS OF
THE STATE ARE MORE CLEARLY DRAWN OUT IN THE LAWS AS WORKS OF ART THE
SYMPOSIUM AND THE PROTAGORAS ARE OF HIGHER EXCELLENCE
BUT NO OTHER
DIALOGUE OF PLATO HAS THE SAME LARGENESS OF VIEW AND THE SAME PERFECTION
OF STYLE NO OTHER SHOWS AN EQUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD OR CONTAINS
MORE OF THOSE THOUGHTS WHICH ARE NEW AS WELL AS OLD AND NOT OF ONE AGE
ONLY BUT OF ALL
NOWHERE IN PLATO IS THERE A DEEPER IRONY OR A GREATER
WEALTH OF HUMOUR OR IMAGERY OR MORE DRAMATIC POWER
NOR IN ANY OTHER OF
HIS WRITINGS IS THE ATTEMPT MADE TO INTERWEAVE LIFE AND SPECULATION OR
TO CONNECT POLITICS WITH PHILOSOPHY
THE REPUBLIC IS THE CENTRE AROUND
WHICH THE OTHER DIALOGUES MAY BE GROUPED HERE PHILOSOPHY REACHES THE
HIGHEST POINT CP ESPECIALLY IN BOOKS V VI VII TO WHICH ANCIENT
THINKERS EVER ATTAINED
PLATO AMONG THE GREEKS LIKE BACON AMONG THE
MODERNS WAS THE FIRST WHO CONCEIVED A METHOD OF KNOWLEDGE ALTHOUGH
NEITHER OF THEM ALWAYS DISTINGUISHED THE BARE OUTLINE OR FORM FROM
THE SUBSTANCE OF TRUTH AND BOTH OF THEM HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH AN
ABSTRACTION OF SCIENCE WHICH WAS NOT YET REALIZED
HE WAS THE GREATEST
METAPHYSICAL GENIUS WHOM THE WORLD HAS SEEN AND IN HIM MORE THAN IN
ANY OTHER ANCIENT THINKER THE GERMS OF FUTURE KNOWLEDGE ARE CONTAINED
THE SCIENCES OF LOGIC AND PSYCHOLOGY WHICH HAVE SUPPLIED SO MANY
INSTRUMENTS OF THOUGHT TO AFTER AGES ARE BASED UPON THE ANALYSES
OF SOCRATES AND PLATO
THE PRINCIPLES OF DEFINITION THE LAW OF
CONTRADICTION THE FALLACY OF ARGUING IN A CIRCLE THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN THE ESSENCE AND ACCIDENTS OF A THING OR NOTION BETWEEN MEANS
AND ENDS BETWEEN CAUSES AND CONDITIONS ALSO THE DIVISION OF THE MIND
INTO THE RATIONAL CONCUPISCENT AND IRASCIBLE ELEMENTS OR OF PLEASURES
AND DESIRES INTO NECESSARY AND UNNECESSARY THESE AND OTHER GREAT
FORMS OF THOUGHT ARE ALL OF THEM TO BE FOUND IN THE REPUBLIC AND WERE
PROBABLY FIRST INVENTED BY PLATO
THE GREATEST OF ALL LOGICAL TRUTHS
AND THE ONE OF WHICH WRITERS ON PHILOSOPHY ARE MOST APT TO LOSE SIGHT
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORDS AND THINGS HAS BEEN MOST STRENUOUSLY
INSISTED ON BY HIM CP
REP POLIT CRATYL ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOT
ALWAYS AVOIDED THE CONFUSION OF THEM IN HIS OWN WRITINGS E G
REP
BUT HE DOES NOT BIND UP TRUTH IN LOGICAL FORMULAE LOGIC IS STILL
VEILED IN METAPHYSICS AND THE SCIENCE WHICH HE IMAGINES TO 'CONTEMPLATE
ALL TRUTH AND ALL EXISTENCE' IS VERY UNLIKE THE DOCTRINE OF THE
SYLLOGISM WHICH ARISTOTLE CLAIMS TO HAVE DISCOVERED SOPH
ELENCHI
NEITHER MUST WE FORGET THAT THE REPUBLIC IS BUT THE THIRD PART OF A
STILL LARGER DESIGN WHICH WAS TO HAVE INCLUDED AN IDEAL HISTORY OF
ATHENS AS WELL AS A POLITICAL AND PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY
THE FRAGMENT OF
THE CRITIAS HAS GIVEN BIRTH TO A WORLD FAMOUS FICTION SECOND ONLY IN
IMPORTANCE TO THE TALE OF TROY AND THE LEGEND OF ARTHUR AND IS SAID AS
A FACT TO HAVE INSPIRED SOME OF THE EARLY NAVIGATORS OF THE SIXTEENTH
CENTURY
THIS MYTHICAL TALE OF WHICH THE SUBJECT WAS A HISTORY OF THE
WARS OF THE ATHENIANS AGAINST THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
FOUNDED UPON AN UNFINISHED POEM OF SOLON TO WHICH IT WOULD HAVE STOOD
IN THE SAME RELATION AS THE WRITINGS OF THE LOGOGRAPHERS TO THE POEMS OF
HOMER
IT WOULD HAVE TOLD OF A STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY CP
TIM INTENDED
TO REPRESENT THE CONFLICT OF PERSIA AND HELLAS
WE MAY JUDGE FROM THE
NOBLE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TIMAEUS FROM THE FRAGMENT OF THE CRITIAS
ITSELF AND FROM THE THIRD BOOK OF THE LAWS IN WHAT MANNER PLATO WOULD
HAVE TREATED THIS HIGH ARGUMENT
WE CAN ONLY GUESS WHY THE GREAT DESIGN
WAS ABANDONED PERHAPS BECAUSE PLATO BECAME SENSIBLE OF SOME INCONGRUITY
IN A FICTITIOUS HISTORY OR BECAUSE HE HAD LOST HIS INTEREST IN IT OR
BECAUSE ADVANCING YEARS FORBADE THE COMPLETION OF IT AND WE MAY PLEASE
OURSELVES WITH THE FANCY THAT HAD THIS IMAGINARY NARRATIVE EVER BEEN
FINISHED WE SHOULD HAVE FOUND PLATO HIMSELF SYMPATHISING WITH THE
STRUGGLE FOR HELLENIC INDEPENDENCE CP
LAWS SINGING A HYMN OF TRIUMPH
OVER MARATHON AND SALAMIS PERHAPS MAKING THE REFLECTION OF HERODOTUS
WHERE HE CONTEMPLATES THE GROWTH OF THE ATHENIAN EMPIRE 'HOW BRAVE A
THING IS FREEDOM OF SPEECH WHICH HAS MADE THE ATHENIANS SO FAR
EXCEED EVERY OTHER STATE OF HELLAS IN GREATNESS OR MORE PROBABLY
ATTRIBUTING THE VICTORY TO THE ANCIENT GOOD ORDER OF ATHENS AND TO THE
FAVOR OF APOLLO AND ATHENE CP
INTROD
TO CRITIAS
AGAIN PLATO MAY BE REGARDED AS THE 'CAPTAIN' 'ARHCHEGOZ' OR LEADER
OF A GOODLY BAND OF FOLLOWERS FOR IN THE REPUBLIC IS TO BE FOUND THE
ORIGINAL OF CICERO'S DE REPUBLICA OF ST
AUGUSTINE'S CITY OF GOD
OF THE UTOPIA OF SIR THOMAS MORE AND OF THE NUMEROUS OTHER IMAGINARY
STATES WHICH ARE FRAMED UPON THE SAME MODEL
THE EXTENT TO WHICH
ARISTOTLE OR THE ARISTOTELIAN SCHOOL WERE INDEBTED TO HIM IN THE
POLITICS HAS BEEN LITTLE RECOGNISED AND THE RECOGNITION IS THE
MORE NECESSARY BECAUSE IT IS NOT MADE BY ARISTOTLE HIMSELF
THE TWO
PHILOSOPHERS HAD MORE IN COMMON THAN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF AND
PROBABLY SOME ELEMENTS OF PLATO REMAIN STILL UNDETECTED IN ARISTOTLE
IN
ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY TOO MANY AFFINITIES MAY BE TRACED NOT ONLY IN THE
WORKS OF THE CAMBRIDGE PLATONISTS BUT IN GREAT ORIGINAL WRITERS LIKE
BERKELEY OR COLERIDGE TO PLATO AND HIS IDEAS
THAT THERE IS A TRUTH
HIGHER THAN EXPERIENCE OF WHICH THE MIND BEARS WITNESS TO HERSELF IS
A CONVICTION WHICH IN OUR OWN GENERATION HAS BEEN ENTHUSIASTICALLY
ASSERTED AND IS PERHAPS GAINING GROUND
OF THE GREEK AUTHORS WHO AT THE
RENAISSANCE BROUGHT A NEW LIFE INTO THE WORLD PLATO HAS HAD THE GREATEST
INFLUENCE
THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO IS ALSO THE FIRST TREATISE UPON
EDUCATION OF WHICH THE WRITINGS OF MILTON AND LOCKE ROUSSEAU JEAN
PAUL AND GOETHE ARE THE LEGITIMATE DESCENDANTS
LIKE DANTE OR BUNYAN
HE HAS A REVELATION OF ANOTHER LIFE LIKE BACON HE IS PROFOUNDLY
IMPRESSED WITH THE UNITY OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE EARLY CHURCH HE EXERCISED
A REAL INFLUENCE ON THEOLOGY AND AT THE REVIVAL OF LITERATURE ON
POLITICS
EVEN THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS WORDS WHEN 'REPEATED AT SECOND HAND'
SYMP HAVE IN ALL AGES RAVISHED THE HEARTS OF MEN WHO HAVE SEEN
REFLECTED IN THEM THEIR OWN HIGHER NATURE
HE IS THE FATHER OF IDEALISM
IN PHILOSOPHY IN POLITICS IN LITERATURE
AND MANY OF THE LATEST
CONCEPTIONS OF MODERN THINKERS AND STATESMEN SUCH AS THE UNITY OF
KNOWLEDGE THE REIGN OF LAW AND THE EQUALITY OF THE SEXES HAVE BEEN
ANTICIPATED IN A DREAM BY HIM
THE ARGUMENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS THE SEARCH AFTER JUSTICE THE NATURE
OF WHICH IS FIRST HINTED AT BY CEPHALUS THE JUST AND BLAMELESS OLD
MAN THEN DISCUSSED ON THE BASIS OF PROVERBIAL MORALITY BY SOCRATES AND
POLEMARCHUS THEN CARICATURED BY THRASYMACHUS AND PARTIALLY EXPLAINED
BY SOCRATES REDUCED TO AN ABSTRACTION BY GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS AND
HAVING BECOME INVISIBLE IN THE INDIVIDUAL REAPPEARS AT LENGTH IN THE
IDEAL STATE WHICH IS CONSTRUCTED BY SOCRATES
THE FIRST CARE OF THE
RULERS IS TO BE EDUCATION OF WHICH AN OUTLINE IS DRAWN AFTER THE OLD
HELLENIC MODEL PROVIDING ONLY FOR AN IMPROVED RELIGION AND MORALITY
AND MORE SIMPLICITY IN MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC A MANLIER STRAIN OF POETRY
AND GREATER HARMONY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE
WE ARE THUS LED ON
TO THE CONCEPTION OF A HIGHER STATE IN WHICH 'NO MAN CALLS ANYTHING HIS
OWN AND IN WHICH THERE IS NEITHER 'MARRYING NOR GIVING IN MARRIAGE
AND 'KINGS ARE PHILOSOPHERS' AND 'PHILOSOPHERS ARE KINGS AND THERE
IS ANOTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION INTELLECTUAL AS WELL AS MORAL AND
RELIGIOUS OF SCIENCE AS WELL AS OF ART AND NOT OF YOUTH ONLY BUT OF
THE WHOLE OF LIFE
SUCH A STATE IS HARDLY TO BE REALIZED IN THIS WORLD
AND QUICKLY DEGENERATES
TO THE PERFECT IDEAL SUCCEEDS THE GOVERNMENT
OF THE SOLDIER AND THE LOVER OF HONOUR THIS AGAIN DECLINING INTO
DEMOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY INTO TYRANNY IN AN IMAGINARY BUT REGULAR ORDER
HAVING NOT MUCH RESEMBLANCE TO THE ACTUAL FACTS
WHEN 'THE WHEEL HAS
COME FULL CIRCLE' WE DO NOT BEGIN AGAIN WITH A NEW PERIOD OF HUMAN LIFE
BUT WE HAVE PASSED FROM THE BEST TO THE WORST AND THERE WE END
THE
SUBJECT IS THEN CHANGED AND THE OLD QUARREL OF POETRY AND PHILOSOPHY
WHICH HAD BEEN MORE LIGHTLY TREATED IN THE EARLIER BOOKS OF THE REPUBLIC
IS NOW RESUMED AND FOUGHT OUT TO A CONCLUSION
POETRY IS DISCOVERED TO
BE AN IMITATION THRICE REMOVED FROM THE TRUTH AND HOMER AS WELL AS
THE DRAMATIC POETS HAVING BEEN CONDEMNED AS AN IMITATOR IS SENT INTO
BANISHMENT ALONG WITH THEM
AND THE IDEA OF THE STATE IS SUPPLEMENTED BY
THE REVELATION OF A FUTURE LIFE
THE DIVISION INTO BOOKS LIKE ALL SIMILAR DIVISIONS CP
SIR G C
LEWIS
IN THE CLASSICAL MUSEUM IS PROBABLY LATER THAN THE AGE OF PLATO
THE
NATURAL DIVISIONS ARE FIVE IN NUMBER 1 BOOK I AND THE FIRST HALF
OF BOOK II DOWN TO THE PARAGRAPH BEGINNING 'I HAD ALWAYS ADMIRED THE
GENIUS OF GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS WHICH IS INTRODUCTORY THE FIRST
BOOK CONTAINING A REFUTATION OF THE POPULAR AND SOPHISTICAL NOTIONS OF
JUSTICE AND CONCLUDING LIKE SOME OF THE EARLIER DIALOGUES WITHOUT
ARRIVING AT ANY DEFINITE RESULT
TO THIS IS APPENDED A RESTATEMENT OF
THE NATURE OF JUSTICE ACCORDING TO COMMON OPINION AND AN ANSWER IS
DEMANDED TO THE QUESTION WHAT IS JUSTICE STRIPPED OF APPEARANCES THE
SECOND DIVISION 2 INCLUDES THE REMAINDER OF THE SECOND AND THE WHOLE
OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH BOOKS WHICH ARE MAINLY OCCUPIED WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE FIRST STATE AND THE FIRST EDUCATION
THE THIRD
DIVISION 3 CONSISTS OF THE FIFTH SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS IN WHICH
PHILOSOPHY RATHER THAN JUSTICE IS THE SUBJECT OF ENQUIRY AND THE
SECOND STATE IS CONSTRUCTED ON PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNISM AND RULED BY
PHILOSOPHERS AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD TAKES THE PLACE
OF THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL VIRTUES
IN THE EIGHTH AND NINTH BOOKS 4
THE PERVERSIONS OF STATES AND OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CORRESPOND TO THEM
ARE REVIEWED IN SUCCESSION AND THE NATURE OF PLEASURE AND THE PRINCIPLE
OF TYRANNY ARE FURTHER ANALYSED IN THE INDIVIDUAL MAN
THE TENTH BOOK
5 IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE IN WHICH THE RELATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY
TO POETRY ARE FINALLY DETERMINED AND THE HAPPINESS OF THE CITIZENS
IN THIS LIFE WHICH HAS NOW BEEN ASSURED IS CROWNED BY THE VISION OF
ANOTHER
OR A MORE GENERAL DIVISION INTO TWO PARTS MAY BE ADOPTED THE FIRST
BOOKS I IV CONTAINING THE DESCRIPTION OF A STATE FRAMED GENERALLY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH HELLENIC NOTIONS OF RELIGION AND MORALITY WHILE IN THE
SECOND BOOKS V X THE HELLENIC STATE IS TRANSFORMED INTO AN
IDEAL KINGDOM OF PHILOSOPHY OF WHICH ALL OTHER GOVERNMENTS ARE THE
PERVERSIONS
THESE TWO POINTS OF VIEW ARE REALLY OPPOSED AND THE
OPPOSITION IS ONLY VEILED BY THE GENIUS OF PLATO
THE REPUBLIC LIKE
THE PHAEDRUS SEE INTRODUCTION TO PHAEDRUS IS AN IMPERFECT WHOLE THE
HIGHER LIGHT OF PHILOSOPHY BREAKS THROUGH THE REGULARITY OF THE
HELLENIC TEMPLE WHICH AT LAST FADES AWAY INTO THE HEAVENS
WHETHER THIS
IMPERFECTION OF STRUCTURE ARISES FROM AN ENLARGEMENT OF THE PLAN
OR FROM THE IMPERFECT RECONCILEMENT IN THE WRITER'S OWN MIND OF THE
STRUGGLING ELEMENTS OF THOUGHT WHICH ARE NOW FIRST BROUGHT TOGETHER
BY HIM OR PERHAPS FROM THE COMPOSITION OF THE WORK AT DIFFERENT
TIMES ARE QUESTIONS LIKE THE SIMILAR QUESTION ABOUT THE ILIAD AND
THE ODYSSEY WHICH ARE WORTH ASKING BUT WHICH CANNOT HAVE A DISTINCT
ANSWER
IN THE AGE OF PLATO THERE WAS NO REGULAR MODE OF PUBLICATION
AND AN AUTHOR WOULD HAVE THE LESS SCRUPLE IN ALTERING OR ADDING TO A
WORK WHICH WAS KNOWN ONLY TO A FEW OF HIS FRIENDS
THERE IS NO ABSURDITY
IN SUPPOSING THAT HE MAY HAVE LAID HIS LABOURS ASIDE FOR A TIME OR
TURNED FROM ONE WORK TO ANOTHER AND SUCH INTERRUPTIONS WOULD BE MORE
LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE CASE OF A LONG THAN OF A SHORT WRITING
IN ALL
ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE THE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF THE PLATONIC WRITINGS
ON INTERNAL EVIDENCE THIS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ANY SINGLE DIALOGUE BEING
COMPOSED AT ONE TIME IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT WHICH MUST BE ADMITTED
TO AFFECT LONGER WORKS SUCH AS THE REPUBLIC AND THE LAWS MORE THAN
SHORTER ONES
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE SEEMING DISCREPANCIES OF
THE REPUBLIC MAY ONLY ARISE OUT OF THE DISCORDANT ELEMENTS WHICH THE
PHILOSOPHER HAS ATTEMPTED TO UNITE IN A SINGLE WHOLE PERHAPS WITHOUT
BEING HIMSELF ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE INCONSISTENCY WHICH IS OBVIOUS TO
US
FOR THERE IS A JUDGMENT OF AFTER AGES WHICH FEW GREAT WRITERS HAVE
EVER BEEN ABLE TO ANTICIPATE FOR THEMSELVES
THEY DO NOT PERCEIVE THE
WANT OF CONNEXION IN THEIR OWN WRITINGS OR THE GAPS IN THEIR SYSTEMS
WHICH ARE VISIBLE ENOUGH TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER THEM
IN THE BEGINNINGS
OF LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY AMID THE FIRST EFFORTS OF THOUGHT AND
LANGUAGE MORE INCONSISTENCIES OCCUR THAN NOW WHEN THE PATHS OF
SPECULATION ARE WELL WORN AND THE MEANING OF WORDS PRECISELY DEFINED
FOR CONSISTENCY TOO IS THE GROWTH OF TIME AND SOME OF THE GREATEST
CREATIONS OF THE HUMAN MIND HAVE BEEN WANTING IN UNITY
TRIED BY THIS
TEST SEVERAL OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES ACCORDING TO OUR MODERN IDEAS
APPEAR TO BE DEFECTIVE BUT THE DEFICIENCY IS NO PROOF THAT THEY WERE
COMPOSED AT DIFFERENT TIMES OR BY DIFFERENT HANDS
AND THE SUPPOSITION
THAT THE REPUBLIC WAS WRITTEN UNINTERRUPTEDLY AND BY A CONTINUOUS EFFORT
IS IN SOME DEGREE CONFIRMED BY THE NUMEROUS REFERENCES FROM ONE PART OF
THE WORK TO ANOTHER
THE SECOND TITLE 'CONCERNING JUSTICE IS NOT THE ONE BY WHICH THE
REPUBLIC IS QUOTED EITHER BY ARISTOTLE OR GENERALLY IN ANTIQUITY AND
LIKE THE OTHER SECOND TITLES OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES MAY THEREFORE BE
ASSUMED TO BE OF LATER DATE
MORGENSTERN AND OTHERS HAVE ASKED
WHETHER THE DEFINITION OF JUSTICE WHICH IS THE PROFESSED AIM OR THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATE IS THE PRINCIPAL ARGUMENT OF THE WORK
THE
ANSWER IS THAT THE TWO BLEND IN ONE AND ARE TWO FACES OF THE SAME
TRUTH FOR JUSTICE IS THE ORDER OF THE STATE AND THE STATE IS THE
VISIBLE EMBODIMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF HUMAN SOCIETY
THE
ONE IS THE SOUL AND THE OTHER IS THE BODY AND THE GREEK IDEAL OF THE
STATE AS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS A FAIR MIND IN A FAIR BODY
IN HEGELIAN
PHRASEOLOGY THE STATE IS THE REALITY OF WHICH JUSTICE IS THE IDEA
OR
DESCRIBED IN CHRISTIAN LANGUAGE THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN AND YET
DEVELOPES INTO A CHURCH OR EXTERNAL KINGDOM 'THE HOUSE NOT MADE WITH
HANDS ETERNAL IN THE HEAVENS IS REDUCED TO THE PROPORTIONS OF AN
EARTHLY BUILDING
OR TO USE A PLATONIC IMAGE JUSTICE AND THE STATE ARE
THE WARP AND THE WOOF WHICH RUN THROUGH THE WHOLE TEXTURE
AND WHEN THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE IS COMPLETED THE CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE IS NOT
DISMISSED BUT REAPPEARS UNDER THE SAME OR DIFFERENT NAMES THROUGHOUT
THE WORK BOTH AS THE INNER LAW OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL AND FINALLY AS
THE PRINCIPLE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS IN ANOTHER LIFE
THE VIRTUES
ARE BASED ON JUSTICE OF WHICH COMMON HONESTY IN BUYING AND SELLING
IS THE SHADOW AND JUSTICE IS BASED ON THE IDEA OF GOOD WHICH IS THE
HARMONY OF THE WORLD AND IS REFLECTED BOTH IN THE INSTITUTIONS OF
STATES AND IN MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES CP
TIM
THE TIMAEUS
WHICH TAKES UP THE POLITICAL RATHER THAN THE ETHICAL SIDE OF THE
REPUBLIC AND IS CHIEFLY OCCUPIED WITH HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THE OUTWARD
WORLD YET CONTAINS MANY INDICATIONS THAT THE SAME LAW IS SUPPOSED TO
REIGN OVER THE STATE OVER NATURE AND OVER MAN
TOO MUCH HOWEVER HAS BEEN MADE OF THIS QUESTION BOTH IN ANCIENT AND
MODERN TIMES
THERE IS A STAGE OF CRITICISM IN WHICH ALL WORKS WHETHER
OF NATURE OR OF ART ARE REFERRED TO DESIGN
NOW IN ANCIENT WRITINGS
AND INDEED IN LITERATURE GENERALLY THERE REMAINS OFTEN A LARGE ELEMENT
WHICH WAS NOT COMPREHENDED IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN
FOR THE PLAN GROWS
UNDER THE AUTHOR'S HAND NEW THOUGHTS OCCUR TO HIM IN THE ACT OF
WRITING HE HAS NOT WORKED OUT THE ARGUMENT TO THE END BEFORE HE BEGINS
THE READER WHO SEEKS TO FIND SOME ONE IDEA UNDER WHICH THE WHOLE MAY BE
CONCEIVED MUST NECESSARILY SEIZE ON THE VAGUEST AND MOST GENERAL
THUS
STALLBAUM WHO IS DISSATISFIED WITH THE ORDINARY EXPLANATIONS OF THE
ARGUMENT OF THE REPUBLIC IMAGINES HIMSELF TO HAVE FOUND THE TRUE
ARGUMENT 'IN THE REPRESENTATION OF HUMAN LIFE IN A STATE PERFECTED BY
JUSTICE AND GOVERNED ACCORDING TO THE IDEA OF GOOD THERE MAY BE SOME
USE IN SUCH GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS BUT THEY CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO EXPRESS
THE DESIGN OF THE WRITER
THE TRUTH IS THAT WE MAY AS WELL SPEAK OF
MANY DESIGNS AS OF ONE NOR NEED ANYTHING BE EXCLUDED FROM THE PLAN OF
A GREAT WORK TO WHICH THE MIND IS NATURALLY LED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF
IDEAS AND WHICH DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE GENERAL PURPOSE
WHAT KIND
OR DEGREE OF UNITY IS TO BE SOUGHT AFTER IN A BUILDING IN THE PLASTIC
ARTS IN POETRY IN PROSE IS A PROBLEM WHICH HAS TO BE DETERMINED
RELATIVELY TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
TO PLATO HIMSELF THE ENQUIRY 'WHAT
WAS THE INTENTION OF THE WRITER OR 'WHAT WAS THE PRINCIPAL ARGUMENT
OF THE REPUBLIC' WOULD HAVE BEEN HARDLY INTELLIGIBLE AND THEREFORE HAD
BETTER BE AT ONCE DISMISSED CP
THE INTRODUCTION TO THE PHAEDRUS
IS NOT THE REPUBLIC THE VEHICLE OF THREE OR FOUR GREAT TRUTHS WHICH
TO PLATO'S OWN MIND ARE MOST NATURALLY REPRESENTED IN THE FORM OF THE
STATE JUST AS IN THE JEWISH PROPHETS THE REIGN OF MESSIAH OR 'THE DAY
OF THE LORD OR THE SUFFERING SERVANT OR PEOPLE OF GOD OR THE 'SUN OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS WITH HEALING IN HIS WINGS' ONLY CONVEY TO US AT LEAST
THEIR GREAT SPIRITUAL IDEALS SO THROUGH THE GREEK STATE PLATO REVEALS
TO US HIS OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT DIVINE PERFECTION WHICH IS THE IDEA OF
GOOD LIKE THE SUN IN THE VISIBLE WORLD ABOUT HUMAN PERFECTION WHICH
IS JUSTICE ABOUT EDUCATION BEGINNING IN YOUTH AND CONTINUING IN LATER
YEARS ABOUT POETS AND SOPHISTS AND TYRANTS WHO ARE THE FALSE TEACHERS
AND EVIL RULERS OF MANKIND ABOUT 'THE WORLD' WHICH IS THE EMBODIMENT OF
THEM ABOUT A KINGDOM WHICH EXISTS NOWHERE UPON EARTH BUT IS LAID UP
IN HEAVEN TO BE THE PATTERN AND RULE OF HUMAN LIFE
NO SUCH INSPIRED
CREATION IS AT UNITY WITH ITSELF ANY MORE THAN THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN
WHEN THE SUN PIERCES THROUGH THEM
EVERY SHADE OF LIGHT AND DARK OF
TRUTH AND OF FICTION WHICH IS THE VEIL OF TRUTH IS ALLOWABLE IN A WORK
OF PHILOSOPHICAL IMAGINATION
IT IS NOT ALL ON THE SAME PLANE IT EASILY
PASSES FROM IDEAS TO MYTHS AND FANCIES FROM FACTS TO FIGURES OF SPEECH
IT IS NOT PROSE BUT POETRY AT LEAST A GREAT PART OF IT AND OUGHT NOT
TO BE JUDGED BY THE RULES OF LOGIC OR THE PROBABILITIES OF HISTORY
THE
WRITER IS NOT FASHIONING HIS IDEAS INTO AN ARTISTIC WHOLE THEY TAKE
POSSESSION OF HIM AND ARE TOO MUCH FOR HIM
WE HAVE NO NEED THEREFORE
TO DISCUSS WHETHER A STATE SUCH AS PLATO HAS CONCEIVED IS PRACTICABLE OR
NOT OR WHETHER THE OUTWARD FORM OR THE INWARD LIFE CAME FIRST INTO THE
MIND OF THE WRITER
FOR THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS IDEAS HAS NOTHING TO
DO WITH THEIR TRUTH AND THE HIGHEST THOUGHTS TO WHICH HE ATTAINS MAY BE
TRULY SAID TO BEAR THE GREATEST 'MARKS OF DESIGN' JUSTICE MORE THAN THE
EXTERNAL FRAME WORK OF THE STATE THE IDEA OF GOOD MORE THAN JUSTICE
THE GREAT SCIENCE OF DIALECTIC OR THE ORGANISATION OF IDEAS HAS NO REAL
CONTENT BUT IS ONLY A TYPE OF THE METHOD OR SPIRIT IN WHICH THE
HIGHER KNOWLEDGE IS TO BE PURSUED BY THE SPECTATOR OF ALL TIME AND
ALL EXISTENCE
IT IS IN THE FIFTH SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS THAT PLATO
REACHES THE 'SUMMIT OF SPECULATION AND THESE ALTHOUGH THEY FAIL TO
SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF A MODERN THINKER MAY THEREFORE BE REGARDED
AS THE MOST IMPORTANT AS THEY ARE ALSO THE MOST ORIGINAL PORTIONS OF
THE WORK
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DISCUSS AT LENGTH A MINOR QUESTION WHICH HAS
BEEN RAISED BY BOECKH RESPECTING THE IMAGINARY DATE AT WHICH THE
CONVERSATION WAS HELD THE YEAR 411 B C
WHICH IS PROPOSED BY HIM WILL
DO AS WELL AS ANY OTHER FOR A WRITER OF FICTION AND ESPECIALLY A
WRITER WHO LIKE PLATO IS NOTORIOUSLY CARELESS OF CHRONOLOGY CP
REP
SYMP ETC ONLY AIMS AT GENERAL PROBABILITY
WHETHER ALL THE PERSONS
MENTIONED IN THE REPUBLIC COULD EVER HAVE MET AT ANY ONE TIME IS NOT
A DIFFICULTY WHICH WOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO AN ATHENIAN READING THE WORK
FORTY YEARS LATER OR TO PLATO HIMSELF AT THE TIME OF WRITING ANY MORE
THAN TO SHAKESPEARE RESPECTING ONE OF HIS OWN DRAMAS AND NEED NOT
GREATLY TROUBLE US NOW
YET THIS MAY BE A QUESTION HAVING NO ANSWER
'WHICH IS STILL WORTH ASKING BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT WE
CANNOT ARGUE HISTORICALLY FROM THE DATES IN PLATO IT WOULD BE USELESS
THEREFORE TO WASTE TIME IN INVENTING FAR FETCHED RECONCILEMENTS OF THEM
IN ORDER TO AVOID CHRONOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS
THE CONJECTURE OF C F
HERMANN THAT GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS ARE NOT THE
BROTHERS BUT THE UNCLES OF PLATO CP
APOL OR THE FANCY OF STALLBAUM
THAT PLATO INTENTIONALLY LEFT ANACHRONISMS INDICATING THE DATES AT WHICH
SOME OF HIS DIALOGUES WERE WRITTEN
THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS IN THE REPUBLIC ARE CEPHALUS POLEMARCHUS
THRASYMACHUS SOCRATES GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS
CEPHALUS APPEARS IN THE
INTRODUCTION ONLY POLEMARCHUS DROPS AT THE END OF THE FIRST ARGUMENT
AND THRASYMACHUS IS REDUCED TO SILENCE AT THE CLOSE OF THE FIRST BOOK
THE MAIN DISCUSSION IS CARRIED ON BY SOCRATES GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS
AMONG THE COMPANY ARE LYSIAS THE ORATOR AND EUTHYDEMUS THE SONS OF
CEPHALUS AND BROTHERS OF POLEMARCHUS AN UNKNOWN CHARMANTIDES THESE ARE
MUTE AUDITORS ALSO THERE IS CLEITOPHON WHO ONCE INTERRUPTS WHERE AS
IN THE DIALOGUE WHICH BEARS HIS NAME HE APPEARS AS THE FRIEND AND ALLY
OF THRASYMACHUS
CEPHALUS THE PATRIARCH OF THE HOUSE HAS BEEN APPROPRIATELY ENGAGED
IN OFFERING A SACRIFICE
HE IS THE PATTERN OF AN OLD MAN WHO HAS ALMOST
DONE WITH LIFE AND IS AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF AND WITH ALL MANKIND
HE
FEELS THAT HE IS DRAWING NEARER TO THE WORLD BELOW AND SEEMS TO LINGER
AROUND THE MEMORY OF THE PAST
HE IS EAGER THAT SOCRATES SHOULD COME
TO VISIT HIM FOND OF THE POETRY OF THE LAST GENERATION HAPPY IN THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF A WELL SPENT LIFE GLAD AT HAVING ESCAPED FROM THE
TYRANNY OF YOUTHFUL LUSTS
HIS LOVE OF CONVERSATION HIS AFFECTION HIS
INDIFFERENCE TO RICHES EVEN HIS GARRULITY ARE INTERESTING TRAITS OF
CHARACTER
HE IS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY BECAUSE THEIR
WHOLE MIND HAS BEEN ABSORBED IN MAKING MONEY
YET HE ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT RICHES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF PLACING MEN ABOVE THE TEMPTATION
TO DISHONESTY OR FALSEHOOD
THE RESPECTFUL ATTENTION SHOWN TO HIM BY
SOCRATES WHOSE LOVE OF CONVERSATION NO LESS THAN THE MISSION IMPOSED
UPON HIM BY THE ORACLE LEADS HIM TO ASK QUESTIONS OF ALL MEN YOUNG AND
OLD ALIKE SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED
WHO BETTER SUITED TO RAISE THE QUESTION
OF JUSTICE THAN CEPHALUS WHOSE LIFE MIGHT SEEM TO BE THE EXPRESSION OF
IT THE MODERATION WITH WHICH OLD AGE IS PICTURED BY CEPHALUS AS A VERY
TOLERABLE PORTION OF EXISTENCE IS CHARACTERISTIC NOT ONLY OF HIM
BUT OF GREEK FEELING GENERALLY AND CONTRASTS WITH THE EXAGGERATION OF
CICERO IN THE DE SENECTUTE
THE EVENING OF LIFE IS DESCRIBED BY PLATO
IN THE MOST EXPRESSIVE MANNER YET WITH THE FEWEST POSSIBLE TOUCHES
AS
CICERO REMARKS EP
AD ATTIC THE AGED CEPHALUS WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF
PLACE IN THE DISCUSSION WHICH FOLLOWS AND WHICH HE COULD NEITHER HAVE
UNDERSTOOD NOR TAKEN PART IN WITHOUT A VIOLATION OF DRAMATIC PROPRIETY
CP
LYSIMACHUS IN THE LACHES
HIS 'SON AND HEIR' POLEMARCHUS HAS THE FRANKNESS AND IMPETUOUSNESS OF
YOUTH HE IS FOR DETAINING SOCRATES BY FORCE IN THE OPENING SCENE
AND WILL NOT 'LET HIM OFF' ON THE SUBJECT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN
LIKE CEPHALUS HE IS LIMITED IN HIS POINT OF VIEW AND REPRESENTS
THE PROVERBIAL STAGE OF MORALITY WHICH HAS RULES OF LIFE RATHER THAN
PRINCIPLES AND HE QUOTES SIMONIDES CP
ARISTOPH
CLOUDS AS HIS FATHER
HAD QUOTED PINDAR
BUT AFTER THIS HE HAS NO MORE TO SAY THE ANSWERS
WHICH HE MAKES ARE ONLY ELICITED FROM HIM BY THE DIALECTIC OF SOCRATES
HE HAS NOT YET EXPERIENCED THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOPHISTS LIKE GLAUCON
AND ADEIMANTUS NOR IS HE SENSIBLE OF THE NECESSITY OF REFUTING THEM HE
BELONGS TO THE PRE SOCRATIC OR PRE DIALECTICAL AGE
HE IS INCAPABLE OF
ARGUING AND IS BEWILDERED BY SOCRATES TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE DOES NOT
KNOW WHAT HE IS SAYING
HE IS MADE TO ADMIT THAT JUSTICE IS A THIEF AND
THAT THE VIRTUES FOLLOW THE ANALOGY OF THE ARTS
FROM HIS BROTHER LYSIAS
CONTRA ERATOSTH WE LEARN THAT HE FELL A VICTIM TO THE THIRTY TYRANTS
BUT NO ALLUSION IS HERE MADE TO HIS FATE NOR TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
CEPHALUS AND HIS FAMILY WERE OF SYRACUSAN ORIGIN AND HAD MIGRATED FROM
THURII TO ATHENS
THE 'CHALCEDONIAN GIANT THRASYMACHUS OF WHOM WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD
IN THE PHAEDRUS IS THE PERSONIFICATION OF THE SOPHISTS ACCORDING TO
PLATO'S CONCEPTION OF THEM IN SOME OF THEIR WORST CHARACTERISTICS
HE
IS VAIN AND BLUSTERING REFUSING TO DISCOURSE UNLESS HE IS PAID FOND OF
MAKING AN ORATION AND HOPING THEREBY TO ESCAPE THE INEVITABLE SOCRATES
BUT A MERE CHILD IN ARGUMENT AND UNABLE TO FORESEE THAT THE NEXT 'MOVE'
TO USE A PLATONIC EXPRESSION WILL 'SHUT HIM UP HE HAS REACHED THE
STAGE OF FRAMING GENERAL NOTIONS AND IN THIS RESPECT IS IN ADVANCE OF
CEPHALUS AND POLEMARCHUS
BUT HE IS INCAPABLE OF DEFENDING THEM IN A
DISCUSSION AND VAINLY TRIES TO COVER HIS CONFUSION WITH BANTER AND
INSOLENCE
WHETHER SUCH DOCTRINES AS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO HIM BY PLATO WERE
REALLY HELD EITHER BY HIM OR BY ANY OTHER SOPHIST IS UNCERTAIN IN THE
INFANCY OF PHILOSOPHY SERIOUS ERRORS ABOUT MORALITY MIGHT EASILY GROW
UP THEY ARE CERTAINLY PUT INTO THE MOUTHS OF SPEAKERS IN THUCYDIDES
BUT WE ARE CONCERNED AT PRESENT WITH PLATO'S DESCRIPTION OF HIM AND NOT
WITH THE HISTORICAL REALITY
THE INEQUALITY OF THE CONTEST ADDS GREATLY
TO THE HUMOUR OF THE SCENE
THE POMPOUS AND EMPTY SOPHIST IS UTTERLY
HELPLESS IN THE HANDS OF THE GREAT MASTER OF DIALECTIC WHO KNOWS HOW
TO TOUCH ALL THE SPRINGS OF VANITY AND WEAKNESS IN HIM
HE IS GREATLY
IRRITATED BY THE IRONY OF SOCRATES BUT HIS NOISY AND IMBECILE RAGE
ONLY LAYS HIM MORE AND MORE OPEN TO THE THRUSTS OF HIS ASSAILANT
HIS
DETERMINATION TO CRAM DOWN THEIR THROATS OR PUT 'BODILY INTO THEIR
SOULS' HIS OWN WORDS ELICITS A CRY OF HORROR FROM SOCRATES
THE
STATE OF HIS TEMPER IS QUITE AS WORTHY OF REMARK AS THE PROCESS OF THE
ARGUMENT
NOTHING IS MORE AMUSING THAN HIS COMPLETE SUBMISSION WHEN
HE HAS BEEN ONCE THOROUGHLY BEATEN
AT FIRST HE SEEMS TO CONTINUE THE
DISCUSSION WITH RELUCTANCE BUT SOON WITH APPARENT GOOD WILL AND HE
EVEN TESTIFIES HIS INTEREST AT A LATER STAGE BY ONE OR TWO OCCASIONAL
REMARKS
WHEN ATTACKED BY GLAUCON HE IS HUMOROUSLY PROTECTED BY SOCRATES
'AS ONE WHO HAS NEVER BEEN HIS ENEMY AND IS NOW HIS FRIEND FROM CICERO
AND QUINTILIAN AND FROM ARISTOTLE'S RHETORIC WE LEARN THAT THE SOPHIST
WHOM PLATO HAS MADE SO RIDICULOUS WAS A MAN OF NOTE WHOSE WRITINGS WERE
PRESERVED IN LATER AGES
THE PLAY ON HIS NAME WHICH WAS MADE BY HIS
CONTEMPORARY HERODICUS ARIS
RHET 'THOU WAST EVER BOLD IN
BATTLE SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF HIM IS NOT DEVOID OF
VERISIMILITUDE
WHEN THRASYMACHUS HAS BEEN SILENCED THE TWO PRINCIPAL RESPONDENTS
GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS APPEAR ON THE SCENE HERE AS IN GREEK TRAGEDY
CP
INTROD
TO PHAEDO THREE ACTORS ARE INTRODUCED
AT FIRST SIGHT
THE TWO SONS OF ARISTON MAY SEEM TO WEAR A FAMILY LIKENESS LIKE THE TWO
FRIENDS SIMMIAS AND CEBES IN THE PHAEDO
BUT ON A NEARER EXAMINATION
OF THEM THE SIMILARITY VANISHES AND THEY ARE SEEN TO BE DISTINCT
CHARACTERS
GLAUCON IS THE IMPETUOUS YOUTH WHO CAN 'JUST NEVER HAVE
ENOUGH OF FECHTING' CP
THE CHARACTER OF HIM IN XEN
MEM
III
6
THE MAN OF PLEASURE WHO IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE MYSTERIES OF LOVE THE
'JUVENIS QUI GAUDET CANIBUS AND WHO IMPROVES THE BREED OF ANIMALS THE
LOVER OF ART AND MUSIC WHO HAS ALL THE EXPERIENCES OF YOUTHFUL LIFE
HE
IS FULL OF QUICKNESS AND PENETRATION PIERCING EASILY BELOW THE CLUMSY
PLATITUDES OF THRASYMACHUS TO THE REAL DIFFICULTY HE TURNS OUT TO THE
LIGHT THE SEAMY SIDE OF HUMAN LIFE AND YET DOES NOT LOSE FAITH IN THE
JUST AND TRUE
IT IS GLAUCON WHO SEIZES WHAT MAY BE TERMED THE LUDICROUS
RELATION OF THE PHILOSOPHER TO THE WORLD TO WHOM A STATE OF SIMPLICITY
IS 'A CITY OF PIGS WHO IS ALWAYS PREPARED WITH A JEST WHEN THE
ARGUMENT OFFERS HIM AN OPPORTUNITY AND WHO IS EVER READY TO SECOND
THE HUMOUR OF SOCRATES AND TO APPRECIATE THE RIDICULOUS WHETHER IN
THE CONNOISSEURS OF MUSIC OR IN THE LOVERS OF THEATRICALS OR IN THE
FANTASTIC BEHAVIOUR OF THE CITIZENS OF DEMOCRACY
HIS WEAKNESSES ARE
SEVERAL TIMES ALLUDED TO BY SOCRATES WHO HOWEVER WILL NOT ALLOW HIM
TO BE ATTACKED BY HIS BROTHER ADEIMANTUS
HE IS A SOLDIER AND LIKE
ADEIMANTUS HAS BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT THE BATTLE OF MEGARA ANNO
456 THE CHARACTER OF ADEIMANTUS IS DEEPER AND GRAVER AND THE
PROFOUNDER OBJECTIONS ARE COMMONLY PUT INTO HIS MOUTH
GLAUCON IS MORE
DEMONSTRATIVE AND GENERALLY OPENS THE GAME
ADEIMANTUS PURSUES THE
ARGUMENT FURTHER
GLAUCON HAS MORE OF THE LIVELINESS AND QUICK SYMPATHY
OF YOUTH ADEIMANTUS HAS THE MATURER JUDGMENT OF A GROWN UP MAN OF
THE WORLD
IN THE SECOND BOOK WHEN GLAUCON INSISTS THAT JUSTICE AND
INJUSTICE SHALL BE CONSIDERED WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR CONSEQUENCES
ADEIMANTUS REMARKS THAT THEY ARE REGARDED BY MANKIND IN GENERAL ONLY FOR
THE SAKE OF THEIR CONSEQUENCES AND IN A SIMILAR VEIN OF REFLECTION HE
URGES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH BOOK THAT SOCRATES FAILS IN MAKING
HIS CITIZENS HAPPY AND IS ANSWERED THAT HAPPINESS IS NOT THE FIRST BUT
THE SECOND THING NOT THE DIRECT AIM BUT THE INDIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF
THE GOOD GOVERNMENT OF A STATE
IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT RELIGION AND
MYTHOLOGY ADEIMANTUS IS THE RESPONDENT BUT GLAUCON BREAKS IN WITH A
SLIGHT JEST AND CARRIES ON THE CONVERSATION IN A LIGHTER TONE ABOUT
MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC TO THE END OF THE BOOK
IT IS ADEIMANTUS AGAIN
WHO VOLUNTEERS THE CRITICISM OF COMMON SENSE ON THE SOCRATIC METHOD OF
ARGUMENT AND WHO REFUSES TO LET SOCRATES PASS LIGHTLY OVER THE QUESTION
OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN
IT IS ADEIMANTUS WHO IS THE RESPONDENT IN THE
MORE ARGUMENTATIVE AS GLAUCON IN THE LIGHTER AND MORE IMAGINATIVE
PORTIONS OF THE DIALOGUE
FOR EXAMPLE THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART
OF THE SIXTH BOOK THE CAUSES OF THE CORRUPTION OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE
CONCEPTION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD ARE DISCUSSED WITH ADEIMANTUS
GLAUCON
RESUMES HIS PLACE OF PRINCIPAL RESPONDENT BUT HE HAS A DIFFICULTY IN
APPREHENDING THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF SOCRATES AND MAKES SOME FALSE HITS
IN THE COURSE OF THE DISCUSSION
ONCE MORE ADEIMANTUS RETURNS WITH THE
ALLUSION TO HIS BROTHER GLAUCON WHOM HE COMPARES TO THE CONTENTIOUS
STATE IN THE NEXT BOOK HE IS AGAIN SUPERSEDED AND GLAUCON CONTINUES TO
THE END
THUS IN A SUCCESSION OF CHARACTERS PLATO REPRESENTS THE SUCCESSIVE
STAGES OF MORALITY BEGINNING WITH THE ATHENIAN GENTLEMAN OF THE OLDEN
TIME WHO IS FOLLOWED BY THE PRACTICAL MAN OF THAT DAY REGULATING HIS
LIFE BY PROVERBS AND SAWS TO HIM SUCCEEDS THE WILD GENERALIZATION OF
THE SOPHISTS AND LASTLY COME THE YOUNG DISCIPLES OF THE GREAT TEACHER
WHO KNOW THE SOPHISTICAL ARGUMENTS BUT WILL NOT BE CONVINCED BY THEM
AND DESIRE TO GO DEEPER INTO THE NATURE OF THINGS
THESE TOO LIKE
CEPHALUS POLEMARCHUS THRASYMACHUS ARE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE
ANOTHER
NEITHER IN THE REPUBLIC NOR IN ANY OTHER DIALOGUE OF PLATO IS
A SINGLE CHARACTER REPEATED
THE DELINEATION OF SOCRATES IN THE REPUBLIC IS NOT WHOLLY CONSISTENT
IN
THE FIRST BOOK WE HAVE MORE OF THE REAL SOCRATES SUCH AS HE IS DEPICTED
IN THE MEMORABILIA OF XENOPHON IN THE EARLIEST DIALOGUES OF PLATO AND
IN THE APOLOGY
HE IS IRONICAL PROVOKING QUESTIONING THE OLD ENEMY
OF THE SOPHISTS READY TO PUT ON THE MASK OF SILENUS AS WELL AS TO ARGUE
SERIOUSLY
BUT IN THE SIXTH BOOK HIS ENMITY TOWARDS THE SOPHISTS ABATES
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THEY ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES RATHER THAN THE
CORRUPTERS OF THE WORLD
HE ALSO BECOMES MORE DOGMATIC AND CONSTRUCTIVE
PASSING BEYOND THE RANGE EITHER OF THE POLITICAL OR THE SPECULATIVE
IDEAS OF THE REAL SOCRATES
IN ONE PASSAGE PLATO HIMSELF SEEMS TO
INTIMATE THAT THE TIME HAD NOW COME FOR SOCRATES WHO HAD PASSED HIS
WHOLE LIFE IN PHILOSOPHY TO GIVE HIS OWN OPINION AND NOT TO BE ALWAYS
REPEATING THE NOTIONS OF OTHER MEN
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT EITHER THE
IDEA OF GOOD OR THE CONCEPTION OF A PERFECT STATE WERE COMPREHENDED IN
THE SOCRATIC TEACHING THOUGH HE CERTAINLY DWELT ON THE NATURE OF
THE UNIVERSAL AND OF FINAL CAUSES CP
XEN
MEM PHAEDO AND A DEEP
THINKER LIKE HIM IN HIS THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS OF PUBLIC TEACHING COULD
HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO TOUCH ON THE NATURE OF FAMILY RELATIONS FOR
WHICH THERE IS ALSO SOME POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN THE MEMORABILIA MEM THE
SOCRATIC METHOD IS NOMINALLY RETAINED AND EVERY INFERENCE IS EITHER PUT
INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RESPONDENT OR REPRESENTED AS THE COMMON DISCOVERY
OF HIM AND SOCRATES
BUT ANY ONE CAN SEE THAT THIS IS A MERE FORM OF
WHICH THE AFFECTATION GROWS WEARISOME AS THE WORK ADVANCES
THE METHOD
OF ENQUIRY HAS PASSED INTO A METHOD OF TEACHING IN WHICH BY THE HELP OF
INTERLOCUTORS THE SAME THESIS IS LOOKED AT FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW
THE NATURE OF THE PROCESS IS TRULY CHARACTERIZED BY GLAUCON WHEN
HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A COMPANION WHO IS NOT GOOD FOR MUCH IN AN
INVESTIGATION BUT CAN SEE WHAT HE IS SHOWN AND MAY PERHAPS GIVE THE
ANSWER TO A QUESTION MORE FLUENTLY THAN ANOTHER
NEITHER CAN WE BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT SOCRATES HIMSELF TAUGHT THE
IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL WHICH IS UNKNOWN TO HIS DISCIPLE GLAUCON IN THE
REPUBLIC CP
APOL NOR IS THERE ANY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE USED
MYTHS OR REVELATIONS OF ANOTHER WORLD AS A VEHICLE OF INSTRUCTION
OR THAT HE WOULD HAVE BANISHED POETRY OR HAVE DENOUNCED THE GREEK
MYTHOLOGY
HIS FAVORITE OATH IS RETAINED AND A SLIGHT MENTION IS MADE
OF THE DAEMONIUM OR INTERNAL SIGN WHICH IS ALLUDED TO BY SOCRATES AS
A PHENOMENON PECULIAR TO HIMSELF
A REAL ELEMENT OF SOCRATIC TEACHING
WHICH IS MORE PROMINENT IN THE REPUBLIC THAN IN ANY OF THE OTHER
DIALOGUES OF PLATO IS THE USE OF EXAMPLE AND ILLUSTRATION GREEK
'LET US APPLY THE TEST OF COMMON INSTANCES 'YOU SAYS ADEIMANTUS
IRONICALLY IN THE SIXTH BOOK 'ARE SO UNACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK IN IMAGES
AND THIS USE OF EXAMPLES OR IMAGES THOUGH TRULY SOCRATIC IN ORIGIN IS
ENLARGED BY THE GENIUS OF PLATO INTO THE FORM OF AN ALLEGORY OR PARABLE
WHICH EMBODIES IN THE CONCRETE WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED OR IS
ABOUT TO BE DESCRIBED IN THE ABSTRACT
THUS THE FIGURE OF THE CAVE IN
BOOK VII IS A RECAPITULATION OF THE DIVISIONS OF KNOWLEDGE IN BOOK VI
THE COMPOSITE ANIMAL IN BOOK IX IS AN ALLEGORY OF THE PARTS OF THE
SOUL
THE NOBLE CAPTAIN AND THE SHIP AND THE TRUE PILOT IN BOOK VI ARE
A FIGURE OF THE RELATION OF THE PEOPLE TO THE PHILOSOPHERS IN THE
STATE WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
OTHER FIGURES SUCH AS THE DOG OR
THE MARRIAGE OF THE PORTIONLESS MAIDEN OR THE DRONES AND WASPS IN THE
EIGHTH AND NINTH BOOKS ALSO FORM LINKS OF CONNEXION IN LONG PASSAGES
OR ARE USED TO RECALL PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS
PLATO IS MOST TRUE TO THE CHARACTER OF HIS MASTER WHEN HE DESCRIBES HIM
AS 'NOT OF THIS WORLD AND WITH THIS REPRESENTATION OF HIM THE IDEAL
STATE AND THE OTHER PARADOXES OF THE REPUBLIC ARE QUITE IN ACCORDANCE
THOUGH THEY CANNOT BE SHOWN TO HAVE BEEN SPECULATIONS OF SOCRATES
TO
HIM AS TO OTHER GREAT TEACHERS BOTH PHILOSOPHICAL AND RELIGIOUS WHEN
THEY LOOKED UPWARD THE WORLD SEEMED TO BE THE EMBODIMENT OF ERROR AND
EVIL
THE COMMON SENSE OF MANKIND HAS REVOLTED AGAINST THIS VIEW OR
HAS ONLY PARTIALLY ADMITTED IT
AND EVEN IN SOCRATES HIMSELF THE STERNER
JUDGEMENT OF THE MULTITUDE AT TIMES PASSES INTO A SORT OF IRONICAL PITY
OR LOVE
MEN IN GENERAL ARE INCAPABLE OF PHILOSOPHY AND ARE THEREFORE
AT ENMITY WITH THE PHILOSOPHER BUT THEIR MISUNDERSTANDING OF HIM IS
UNAVOIDABLE FOR THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM AS HE TRULY IS IN HIS OWN
IMAGE THEY ARE ONLY ACQUAINTED WITH ARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS POSSESSING NO
NATIVE FORCE OF TRUTH WORDS WHICH ADMIT OF MANY APPLICATIONS
THEIR
LEADERS HAVE NOTHING TO MEASURE WITH AND ARE THEREFORE IGNORANT OF
THEIR OWN STATURE
BUT THEY ARE TO BE PITIED OR LAUGHED AT NOT TO BE
QUARRELLED WITH THEY MEAN WELL WITH THEIR NOSTRUMS IF THEY COULD ONLY
LEARN THAT THEY ARE CUTTING OFF A HYDRA'S HEAD
THIS MODERATION TOWARDS
THOSE WHO ARE IN ERROR IS ONE OF THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES
OF SOCRATES IN THE REPUBLIC
IN ALL THE DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIONS OF
SOCRATES WHETHER OF XENOPHON OR PLATO AND AMID THE DIFFERENCES OF
THE EARLIER OR LATER DIALOGUES HE ALWAYS RETAINS THE CHARACTER OF THE
UNWEARIED AND DISINTERESTED SEEKER AFTER TRUTH WITHOUT WHICH HE WOULD
HAVE CEASED TO BE SOCRATES
LEAVING THE CHARACTERS WE MAY NOW ANALYSE THE CONTENTS OF THE REPUBLIC
AND THEN PROCEED TO CONSIDER 1 THE GENERAL ASPECTS OF THIS HELLENIC
IDEAL OF THE STATE 2 THE MODERN LIGHTS IN WHICH THE THOUGHTS OF PLATO
MAY BE READ
BOOK I
THE REPUBLIC OPENS WITH A TRULY GREEK SCENE A FESTIVAL IN
HONOUR OF THE GODDESS BENDIS WHICH IS HELD IN THE PIRAEUS TO THIS IS
ADDED THE PROMISE OF AN EQUESTRIAN TORCH RACE IN THE EVENING
THE WHOLE
WORK IS SUPPOSED TO BE RECITED BY SOCRATES ON THE DAY AFTER THE FESTIVAL
TO A SMALL PARTY CONSISTING OF CRITIAS TIMAEUS HERMOCRATES AND
ANOTHER THIS WE LEARN FROM THE FIRST WORDS OF THE TIMAEUS
WHEN THE RHETORICAL ADVANTAGE OF RECITING THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN GAINED
THE ATTENTION IS NOT DISTRACTED BY ANY REFERENCE TO THE AUDIENCE NOR
IS THE READER FURTHER REMINDED OF THE EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH OF THE
NARRATIVE
OF THE NUMEROUS COMPANY THREE ONLY TAKE ANY SERIOUS PART IN
THE DISCUSSION NOR ARE WE INFORMED WHETHER IN THE EVENING THEY WENT TO
THE TORCH RACE OR TALKED AS IN THE SYMPOSIUM THROUGH THE NIGHT
THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CONVERSATION HAS ARISEN IS DESCRIBED AS
FOLLOWS SOCRATES AND HIS COMPANION GLAUCON ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE THE
FESTIVAL WHEN THEY ARE DETAINED BY A MESSAGE FROM POLEMARCHUS WHO
SPEEDILY APPEARS ACCOMPANIED BY ADEIMANTUS THE BROTHER OF GLAUCON AND
WITH PLAYFUL VIOLENCE COMPELS THEM TO REMAIN PROMISING THEM NOT ONLY
THE TORCH RACE BUT THE PLEASURE OF CONVERSATION WITH THE YOUNG WHICH
TO SOCRATES IS A FAR GREATER ATTRACTION
THEY RETURN TO THE HOUSE OF
CEPHALUS POLEMARCHUS' FATHER NOW IN EXTREME OLD AGE WHO IS FOUND
SITTING UPON A CUSHIONED SEAT CROWNED FOR A SACRIFICE
'YOU SHOULD COME
TO ME OFTENER SOCRATES FOR I AM TOO OLD TO GO TO YOU AND AT MY TIME
OF LIFE HAVING LOST OTHER PLEASURES I CARE THE MORE FOR CONVERSATION
SOCRATES ASKS HIM WHAT HE THINKS OF AGE TO WHICH THE OLD MAN REPLIES
THAT THE SORROWS AND DISCONTENTS OF AGE ARE TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE
TEMPERS OF MEN AND THAT AGE IS A TIME OF PEACE IN WHICH THE TYRANNY
OF THE PASSIONS IS NO LONGER FELT
YES REPLIES SOCRATES BUT THE WORLD
WILL SAY CEPHALUS THAT YOU ARE HAPPY IN OLD AGE BECAUSE YOU ARE RICH
'AND THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT THEY SAY SOCRATES BUT NOT SO MUCH AS
THEY IMAGINE AS THEMISTOCLES REPLIED TO THE SERIPHIAN NEITHER YOU IF
YOU HAD BEEN AN ATHENIAN NOR I IF I HAD BEEN A SERIPHIAN WOULD EVER
HAVE BEEN FAMOUS I MIGHT IN LIKE MANNER REPLY TO YOU NEITHER A GOOD
POOR MAN CAN BE HAPPY IN AGE NOR YET A BAD RICH MAN SOCRATES REMARKS
THAT CEPHALUS APPEARS NOT TO CARE ABOUT RICHES A QUALITY WHICH HE
ASCRIBES TO HIS HAVING INHERITED NOT ACQUIRED THEM AND WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT HE CONSIDERS TO BE THE CHIEF ADVANTAGE OF THEM
CEPHALUS
ANSWERS THAT WHEN YOU ARE OLD THE BELIEF IN THE WORLD BELOW GROWS UPON
YOU AND THEN TO HAVE DONE JUSTICE AND NEVER TO HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO
DO INJUSTICE THROUGH POVERTY AND NEVER TO HAVE DECEIVED ANYONE ARE
FELT TO BE UNSPEAKABLE BLESSINGS
SOCRATES WHO IS EVIDENTLY PREPARING
FOR AN ARGUMENT NEXT ASKS WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE WORD JUSTICE TO
TELL THE TRUTH AND PAY YOUR DEBTS NO MORE THAN THIS OR MUST WE ADMIT
EXCEPTIONS OUGHT I FOR EXAMPLE TO PUT BACK INTO THE HANDS OF MY
FRIEND WHO HAS GONE MAD THE SWORD WHICH I BORROWED OF HIM WHEN HE
WAS IN HIS RIGHT MIND 'THERE MUST BE EXCEPTIONS 'AND YET SAYS
POLEMARCHUS 'THE DEFINITION WHICH HAS BEEN GIVEN HAS THE AUTHORITY
OF SIMONIDES HERE CEPHALUS RETIRES TO LOOK AFTER THE SACRIFICES
AND BEQUEATHS AS SOCRATES FACETIOUSLY REMARKS THE POSSESSION OF THE
ARGUMENT TO HIS HEIR POLEMARCHUS
THE DESCRIPTION OF OLD AGE IS FINISHED AND PLATO AS HIS MANNER IS HAS
TOUCHED THE KEY NOTE OF THE WHOLE WORK IN ASKING FOR THE DEFINITION OF
JUSTICE FIRST SUGGESTING THE QUESTION WHICH GLAUCON AFTERWARDS PURSUES
RESPECTING EXTERNAL GOODS AND PREPARING FOR THE CONCLUDING MYTHUS OF
THE WORLD BELOW IN THE SLIGHT ALLUSION OF CEPHALUS
THE PORTRAIT OF THE
JUST MAN IS A NATURAL FRONTISPIECE OR INTRODUCTION TO THE LONG DISCOURSE
WHICH FOLLOWS AND MAY PERHAPS IMPLY THAT IN ALL OUR PERPLEXITY ABOUT
THE NATURE OF JUSTICE THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCERNING 'WHO IS
A JUST MAN THE FIRST EXPLANATION HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY A SAYING OF
SIMONIDES AND NOW SOCRATES HAS A MIND TO SHOW THAT THE RESOLUTION OF
JUSTICE INTO TWO UNCONNECTED PRECEPTS WHICH HAVE NO COMMON PRINCIPLE
FAILS TO SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF DIALECTIC
HE PROCEEDS WHAT DID SIMONIDES MEAN BY THIS SAYING OF HIS DID HE
MEAN THAT I WAS TO GIVE BACK ARMS TO A MADMAN 'NO NOT IN THAT CASE
NOT IF THE PARTIES ARE FRIENDS AND EVIL WOULD RESULT
HE MEANT THAT YOU
WERE TO DO WHAT WAS PROPER GOOD TO FRIENDS AND HARM TO ENEMIES EVERY
ACT DOES SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY AND FOLLOWING THIS ANALOGY SOCRATES
ASKS WHAT IS THIS DUE AND PROPER THING WHICH JUSTICE DOES AND TO WHOM
HE IS ANSWERED THAT JUSTICE DOES GOOD TO FRIENDS AND HARM TO ENEMIES
BUT IN WHAT WAY GOOD OR HARM 'IN MAKING ALLIANCES WITH THE ONE AND
GOING TO WAR WITH THE OTHER THEN IN TIME OF PEACE WHAT IS THE GOOD
OF JUSTICE THE ANSWER IS THAT JUSTICE IS OF USE IN CONTRACTS AND
CONTRACTS ARE MONEY PARTNERSHIPS
YES BUT HOW IN SUCH PARTNERSHIPS
IS THE JUST MAN OF MORE USE THAN ANY OTHER MAN 'WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE
MONEY SAFELY KEPT AND NOT USED THEN JUSTICE WILL BE USEFUL WHEN MONEY
IS USELESS
AND THERE IS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY JUSTICE LIKE THE ART OF
WAR OR ANY OTHER ART MUST BE OF OPPOSITES GOOD AT ATTACK AS WELL AS
AT DEFENCE AT STEALING AS WELL AS AT GUARDING
BUT THEN JUSTICE IS A
THIEF THOUGH A HERO NOTWITHSTANDING LIKE AUTOLYCUS THE HOMERIC HERO
WHO WAS 'EXCELLENT ABOVE ALL MEN IN THEFT AND PERJURY' TO SUCH A PASS
HAVE YOU AND HOMER AND SIMONIDES BROUGHT US THOUGH I DO NOT FORGET THAT
THE THIEVING MUST BE FOR THE GOOD OF FRIENDS AND THE HARM OF ENEMIES
AND STILL THERE ARISES ANOTHER QUESTION ARE FRIENDS TO BE INTERPRETED
AS REAL OR SEEMING ENEMIES AS REAL OR SEEMING AND ARE OUR FRIENDS TO
BE ONLY THE GOOD AND OUR ENEMIES TO BE THE EVIL THE ANSWER IS THAT
WE MUST DO GOOD TO OUR SEEMING AND REAL GOOD FRIENDS AND EVIL TO OUR
SEEMING AND REAL EVIL ENEMIES GOOD TO THE GOOD EVIL TO THE EVIL
BUT
OUGHT WE TO RENDER EVIL FOR EVIL AT ALL WHEN TO DO SO WILL ONLY MAKE
MEN MORE EVIL CAN JUSTICE PRODUCE INJUSTICE ANY MORE THAN THE ART OF
HORSEMANSHIP CAN MAKE BAD HORSEMEN OR HEAT PRODUCE COLD THE FINAL
CONCLUSION IS THAT NO SAGE OR POET EVER SAID THAT THE JUST RETURN
EVIL FOR EVIL THIS WAS A MAXIM OF SOME RICH AND MIGHTY MAN PERIANDER
PERDICCAS OR ISMENIAS THE THEBAN ABOUT B C
398 381
THUS THE FIRST STAGE OF APHORISTIC OR UNCONSCIOUS MORALITY IS SHOWN TO
BE INADEQUATE TO THE WANTS OF THE AGE THE AUTHORITY OF THE POETS IS SET
ASIDE AND THROUGH THE WINDING MAZES OF DIALECTIC WE MAKE AN APPROACH
TO THE CHRISTIAN PRECEPT OF FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES
SIMILAR WORDS
ARE APPLIED BY THE PERSIAN MYSTIC POET TO THE DIVINE BEING WHEN THE
QUESTIONING SPIRIT IS STIRRED WITHIN HIM 'IF BECAUSE I DO EVIL THOU
PUNISHEST ME BY EVIL WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEE AND ME IN
THIS BOTH PLATO AND KHEYAM RISE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF MANY CHRISTIAN
THEOLOGIANS
THE FIRST DEFINITION OF JUSTICE EASILY PASSES INTO THE
SECOND FOR THE SIMPLE WORDS 'TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND PAY YOUR DEBTS' IS
SUBSTITUTED THE MORE ABSTRACT 'TO DO GOOD TO YOUR FRIENDS AND HARM TO
YOUR ENEMIES EITHER OF THESE EXPLANATIONS GIVES A SUFFICIENT RULE
OF LIFE FOR PLAIN MEN BUT THEY BOTH FALL SHORT OF THE PRECISION OF
PHILOSOPHY
WE MAY NOTE IN PASSING THE ANTIQUITY OF CASUISTRY WHICH NOT
ONLY ARISES OUT OF THE CONFLICT OF ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES IN PARTICULAR
CASES BUT ALSO OUT OF THE EFFORT TO ATTAIN THEM AND IS PRIOR AS WELL
AS POSTERIOR TO OUR FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS OF MORALITY
THE 'INTERROGATION'
OF MORAL IDEAS THE APPEAL TO THE AUTHORITY OF HOMER THE CONCLUSION
THAT THE MAXIM 'DO GOOD TO YOUR FRIENDS AND HARM TO YOUR ENEMIES
BEING ERRONEOUS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE WORD OF ANY GREAT MAN ARE ALL
OF THEM VERY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PLATONIC SOCRATES
HERE THRASYMACHUS WHO HAS MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO INTERRUPT BUT
HAS HITHERTO BEEN KEPT IN ORDER BY THE COMPANY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A
PAUSE AND RUSHES INTO THE ARENA BEGINNING LIKE A SAVAGE ANIMAL WITH A
ROAR
'SOCRATES HE SAYS 'WHAT FOLLY IS THIS WHY DO YOU AGREE TO BE
VANQUISHED BY ONE ANOTHER IN A PRETENDED ARGUMENT HE THEN PROHIBITS
ALL THE ORDINARY DEFINITIONS OF JUSTICE TO WHICH SOCRATES REPLIES THAT
HE CANNOT TELL HOW MANY TWELVE IS IF HE IS FORBIDDEN TO SAY 2 X 6 OR
3 X 4 OR 6 X 2 OR 4 X 3
AT FIRST THRASYMACHUS IS RELUCTANT TO ARGUE
BUT AT LENGTH WITH A PROMISE OF PAYMENT ON THE PART OF THE COMPANY AND
OF PRAISE FROM SOCRATES HE IS INDUCED TO OPEN THE GAME
'LISTEN HE
SAYS 'MY ANSWER IS THAT MIGHT IS RIGHT JUSTICE THE INTEREST OF THE
STRONGER NOW PRAISE ME LET ME UNDERSTAND YOU FIRST
DO YOU MEAN THAT
BECAUSE POLYDAMAS THE WRESTLER WHO IS STRONGER THAN WE ARE FINDS THE
EATING OF BEEF FOR HIS INTEREST THE EATING OF BEEF IS ALSO FOR OUR
INTEREST WHO ARE NOT SO STRONG THRASYMACHUS IS INDIGNANT AT THE
ILLUSTRATION AND IN POMPOUS WORDS APPARENTLY INTENDED TO RESTORE
DIGNITY TO THE ARGUMENT HE EXPLAINS HIS MEANING TO BE THAT THE RULERS
MAKE LAWS FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS
BUT SUPPOSE SAYS SOCRATES THAT THE
RULER OR STRONGER MAKES A MISTAKE THEN THE INTEREST OF THE STRONGER IS
NOT HIS INTEREST
THRASYMACHUS IS SAVED FROM THIS SPEEDY DOWNFALL BY HIS
DISCIPLE CLEITOPHON WHO INTRODUCES THE WORD 'THINKS NOT THE ACTUAL
INTEREST OF THE RULER BUT WHAT HE THINKS OR WHAT SEEMS TO BE HIS
INTEREST IS JUSTICE
THE CONTRADICTION IS ESCAPED BY THE UNMEANING
EVASION FOR THOUGH HIS REAL AND APPARENT INTERESTS MAY DIFFER WHAT THE
RULER THINKS TO BE HIS INTEREST WILL ALWAYS REMAIN WHAT HE THINKS TO BE
HIS INTEREST
OF COURSE THIS WAS NOT THE ORIGINAL ASSERTION NOR IS THE NEW
INTERPRETATION ACCEPTED BY THRASYMACHUS HIMSELF
BUT SOCRATES IS NOT
DISPOSED TO QUARREL ABOUT WORDS IF AS HE SIGNIFICANTLY INSINUATES
HIS ADVERSARY HAS CHANGED HIS MIND
IN WHAT FOLLOWS THRASYMACHUS DOES
IN FACT WITHDRAW HIS ADMISSION THAT THE RULER MAY MAKE A MISTAKE FOR HE
AFFIRMS THAT THE RULER AS A RULER IS INFALLIBLE
SOCRATES IS QUITE READY
TO ACCEPT THE NEW POSITION WHICH HE EQUALLY TURNS AGAINST THRASYMACHUS
BY THE HELP OF THE ANALOGY OF THE ARTS
EVERY ART OR SCIENCE HAS AN
INTEREST BUT THIS INTEREST IS TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ACCIDENTAL
INTEREST OF THE ARTIST AND IS ONLY CONCERNED WITH THE GOOD OF THE
THINGS OR PERSONS WHICH COME UNDER THE ART
AND JUSTICE HAS AN INTEREST
WHICH IS THE INTEREST NOT OF THE RULER OR JUDGE BUT OF THOSE WHO COME
UNDER HIS SWAY
THRASYMACHUS IS ON THE BRINK OF THE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION WHEN HE MAKES
A BOLD DIVERSION
'TELL ME SOCRATES HE SAYS 'HAVE YOU A NURSE WHAT
A QUESTION WHY DO YOU ASK 'BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE SHE NEGLECTS YOU AND
LETS YOU GO ABOUT DRIVELLING AND HAS NOT EVEN TAUGHT YOU TO KNOW THE
SHEPHERD FROM THE SHEEP
FOR YOU FANCY THAT SHEPHERDS AND RULERS NEVER
THINK OF THEIR OWN INTEREST BUT ONLY OF THEIR SHEEP OR SUBJECTS
WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS THAT THEY FATTEN THEM FOR THEIR USE SHEEP AND
SUBJECTS ALIKE
AND EXPERIENCE PROVES THAT IN EVERY RELATION OF LIFE
THE JUST MAN IS THE LOSER AND THE UNJUST THE GAINER ESPECIALLY WHERE
INJUSTICE IS ON THE GRAND SCALE WHICH IS QUITE ANOTHER THING FROM THE
PETTY ROGUERIES OF SWINDLERS AND BURGLARS AND ROBBERS OF TEMPLES
THE
LANGUAGE OF MEN PROVES THIS OUR 'GRACIOUS' AND 'BLESSED' TYRANT AND THE
LIKE ALL WHICH TENDS TO SHOW 1 THAT JUSTICE IS THE INTEREST OF THE
STRONGER AND 2 THAT INJUSTICE IS MORE PROFITABLE AND ALSO STRONGER
THAN JUSTICE
THRASYMACHUS WHO IS BETTER AT A SPEECH THAN AT A CLOSE ARGUMENT HAVING
DELUGED THE COMPANY WITH WORDS HAS A MIND TO ESCAPE
BUT THE OTHERS
WILL NOT LET HIM GO AND SOCRATES ADDS A HUMBLE BUT EARNEST REQUEST THAT
HE WILL NOT DESERT THEM AT SUCH A CRISIS OF THEIR FATE
'AND WHAT CAN I
DO MORE FOR YOU HE SAYS 'WOULD YOU HAVE ME PUT THE WORDS BODILY
INTO YOUR SOULS GOD FORBID REPLIES SOCRATES BUT WE WANT YOU TO BE
CONSISTENT IN THE USE OF TERMS AND NOT TO EMPLOY 'PHYSICIAN' IN AN
EXACT SENSE AND THEN AGAIN 'SHEPHERD' OR 'RULER' IN AN INEXACT IF THE
WORDS ARE STRICTLY TAKEN THE RULER AND THE SHEPHERD LOOK ONLY TO THE
GOOD OF THEIR PEOPLE OR FLOCKS AND NOT TO THEIR OWN WHEREAS YOU INSIST
THAT RULERS ARE SOLELY ACTUATED BY LOVE OF OFFICE
'NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
REPLIES THRASYMACHUS
THEN WHY ARE THEY PAID IS NOT THE REASON THAT
THEIR INTEREST IS NOT COMPREHENDED IN THEIR ART AND IS THEREFORE THE
CONCERN OF ANOTHER ART THE ART OF PAY WHICH IS COMMON TO THE ARTS IN
GENERAL AND THEREFORE NOT IDENTICAL WITH ANY ONE OF THEM NOR WOULD ANY
MAN BE A RULER UNLESS HE WERE INDUCED BY THE HOPE OF REWARD OR THE FEAR
OF PUNISHMENT THE REWARD IS MONEY OR HONOUR THE PUNISHMENT IS THE
NECESSITY OF BEING RULED BY A MAN WORSE THAN HIMSELF
AND IF A STATE OR
CHURCH WERE COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF GOOD MEN THEY WOULD BE AFFECTED BY
THE LAST MOTIVE ONLY AND THERE WOULD BE AS MUCH 'NOLO EPISCOPARI' AS
THERE IS AT PRESENT OF THE OPPOSITE
THE SATIRE ON EXISTING GOVERNMENTS IS HEIGHTENED BY THE SIMPLE AND
APPARENTLY INCIDENTAL MANNER IN WHICH THE LAST REMARK IS INTRODUCED
THERE IS A SIMILAR IRONY IN THE ARGUMENT THAT THE GOVERNORS OF MANKIND
DO NOT LIKE BEING IN OFFICE AND THAT THEREFORE THEY DEMAND PAY
ENOUGH OF THIS THE OTHER ASSERTION OF THRASYMACHUS IS FAR MORE
IMPORTANT THAT THE UNJUST LIFE IS MORE GAINFUL THAN THE JUST
NOW AS
YOU AND I GLAUCON ARE NOT CONVINCED BY HIM WE MUST REPLY TO HIM BUT
IF WE TRY TO COMPARE THEIR RESPECTIVE GAINS WE SHALL WANT A JUDGE
TO DECIDE FOR US WE HAD BETTER THEREFORE PROCEED BY MAKING MUTUAL
ADMISSIONS OF THE TRUTH TO ONE ANOTHER
THRASYMACHUS HAD ASSERTED THAT PERFECT INJUSTICE WAS MORE GAINFUL THAN
PERFECT JUSTICE AND AFTER A LITTLE HESITATION HE IS INDUCED BY SOCRATES
TO ADMIT THE STILL GREATER PARADOX THAT INJUSTICE IS VIRTUE AND JUSTICE
VICE
SOCRATES PRAISES HIS FRANKNESS AND ASSUMES THE ATTITUDE OF ONE
WHOSE ONLY WISH IS TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF HIS OPPONENTS
AT THE
SAME TIME HE IS WEAVING A NET IN WHICH THRASYMACHUS IS FINALLY ENCLOSED
THE ADMISSION IS ELICITED FROM HIM THAT THE JUST MAN SEEKS TO GAIN AN
ADVANTAGE OVER THE UNJUST ONLY BUT NOT OVER THE JUST WHILE THE UNJUST
WOULD GAIN AN ADVANTAGE OVER EITHER
SOCRATES IN ORDER TO TEST THIS
STATEMENT EMPLOYS ONCE MORE THE FAVOURITE ANALOGY OF THE ARTS
THE
MUSICIAN DOCTOR SKILLED ARTIST OF ANY SORT DOES NOT SEEK TO GAIN MORE
THAN THE SKILLED BUT ONLY MORE THAN THE UNSKILLED THAT IS TO SAY HE
WORKS UP TO A RULE STANDARD LAW AND DOES NOT EXCEED IT WHEREAS THE
UNSKILLED MAKES RANDOM EFFORTS AT EXCESS
THUS THE SKILLED FALLS ON THE
SIDE OF THE GOOD AND THE UNSKILLED ON THE SIDE OF THE EVIL AND THE
JUST IS THE SKILLED AND THE UNJUST IS THE UNSKILLED
THERE WAS GREAT DIFFICULTY IN BRINGING THRASYMACHUS TO THE POINT THE
DAY WAS HOT AND HE WAS STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS SEEN TO BLUSH
BUT HIS OTHER THESIS THAT
INJUSTICE WAS STRONGER THAN JUSTICE HAS NOT YET BEEN REFUTED AND
SOCRATES NOW PROCEEDS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THIS WHICH WITH THE
ASSISTANCE OF THRASYMACHUS HE HOPES TO CLEAR UP THE LATTER IS AT FIRST
CHURLISH BUT IN THE JUDICIOUS HANDS OF SOCRATES IS SOON RESTORED TO
GOOD HUMOUR IS THERE NOT HONOUR AMONG THIEVES IS NOT THE STRENGTH OF
INJUSTICE ONLY A REMNANT OF JUSTICE IS NOT ABSOLUTE INJUSTICE ABSOLUTE
WEAKNESS ALSO A HOUSE THAT IS DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND TWO
MEN WHO QUARREL DETRACT FROM ONE ANOTHER'S STRENGTH AND HE WHO IS AT
WAR WITH HIMSELF IS THE ENEMY OF HIMSELF AND THE GODS
NOT WICKEDNESS
THEREFORE BUT SEMI WICKEDNESS FLOURISHES IN STATES A REMNANT OF
GOOD IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE UNION IN ACTION POSSIBLE THERE IS NO
KINGDOM OF EVIL IN THIS WORLD
ANOTHER QUESTION HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED IS THE JUST OR THE UNJUST THE
HAPPIER TO THIS WE REPLY THAT EVERY ART HAS AN END AND AN EXCELLENCE
OR VIRTUE BY WHICH THE END IS ACCOMPLISHED
AND IS NOT THE END OF
THE SOUL HAPPINESS AND JUSTICE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE SOUL BY WHICH
HAPPINESS IS ATTAINED JUSTICE AND HAPPINESS BEING THUS SHOWN TO BE
INSEPARABLE THE QUESTION WHETHER THE JUST OR THE UNJUST IS THE HAPPIER
HAS DISAPPEARED
THRASYMACHUS REPLIES 'LET THIS BE YOUR ENTERTAINMENT SOCRATES AT THE
FESTIVAL OF BENDIS YES AND A VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT WITH WHICH YOUR
KINDNESS HAS SUPPLIED ME NOW THAT YOU HAVE LEFT OFF SCOLDING
AND YET
NOT A GOOD ENTERTAINMENT BUT THAT WAS MY OWN FAULT FOR I TASTED OF TOO
MANY THINGS
FIRST OF ALL THE NATURE OF JUSTICE WAS THE SUBJECT OF OUR
ENQUIRY AND THEN WHETHER JUSTICE IS VIRTUE AND WISDOM OR EVIL AND
FOLLY AND THEN THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF JUST AND UNJUST AND THE
SUM OF ALL IS THAT I KNOW NOT WHAT JUSTICE IS HOW THEN SHALL I KNOW
WHETHER THE JUST IS HAPPY OR NOT
THUS THE SOPHISTICAL FABRIC HAS BEEN DEMOLISHED CHIEFLY BY APPEALING
TO THE ANALOGY OF THE ARTS
'JUSTICE IS LIKE THE ARTS 1 IN HAVING NO
EXTERNAL INTEREST AND 2 IN NOT AIMING AT EXCESS AND 3 JUSTICE IS
TO HAPPINESS WHAT THE IMPLEMENT OF THE WORKMAN IS TO HIS WORK AT THIS
THE MODERN READER IS APT TO STUMBLE BECAUSE HE FORGETS THAT PLATO IS
WRITING IN AN AGE WHEN THE ARTS AND THE VIRTUES LIKE THE MORAL
AND INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES WERE STILL UNDISTINGUISHED
AMONG EARLY
ENQUIRERS INTO THE NATURE OF HUMAN ACTION THE ARTS HELPED TO FILL UP
THE VOID OF SPECULATION AND AT FIRST THE COMPARISON OF THE ARTS AND THE
VIRTUES WAS NOT PERCEIVED BY THEM TO BE FALLACIOUS
THEY ONLY SAW THE
POINTS OF AGREEMENT IN THEM AND NOT THE POINTS OF DIFFERENCE
VIRTUE
LIKE ART MUST TAKE MEANS TO AN END GOOD MANNERS ARE BOTH AN ART AND
A VIRTUE CHARACTER IS NATURALLY DESCRIBED UNDER THE IMAGE OF A STATUE
AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER FIGURES OF SPEECH WHICH ARE READILY TRANSFERRED
FROM ART TO MORALS
THE NEXT GENERATION CLEARED UP THESE PERPLEXITIES
OR AT LEAST SUPPLIED AFTER AGES WITH A FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THEM
THE
CONTEMPORARIES OF PLATO WERE IN A STATE OF TRANSITION AND HAD NOT YET
FULLY REALIZED THE COMMON SENSE DISTINCTION OF ARISTOTLE THAT 'VIRTUE
IS CONCERNED WITH ACTION ART WITH PRODUCTION' NIC
ETH OR THAT
'VIRTUE IMPLIES INTENTION AND CONSTANCY OF PURPOSE WHEREAS 'ART
REQUIRES KNOWLEDGE ONLY'
AND YET IN THE ABSURDITIES WHICH FOLLOW FROM
SOME USES OF THE ANALOGY THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INTIMATION CONVEYED THAT
VIRTUE IS MORE THAN ART
THIS IS IMPLIED IN THE REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM
THAT 'JUSTICE IS A THIEF AND IN THE DISSATISFACTION WHICH SOCRATES
EXPRESSES AT THE FINAL RESULT
THE EXPRESSION 'AN ART OF PAY' WHICH IS DESCRIBED AS 'COMMON TO ALL THE
ARTS' IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORDINARY USE OF LANGUAGE
NOR IS IT
EMPLOYED ELSEWHERE EITHER BY PLATO OR BY ANY OTHER GREEK WRITER
IT IS
SUGGESTED BY THE ARGUMENT AND SEEMS TO EXTEND THE CONCEPTION OF ART TO
DOING AS WELL AS MAKING
ANOTHER FLAW OR INACCURACY OF LANGUAGE MAY BE
NOTED IN THE WORDS 'MEN WHO ARE INJURED ARE MADE MORE UNJUST FOR
THOSE WHO ARE INJURED ARE NOT NECESSARILY MADE WORSE BUT ONLY HARMED OR
ILL TREATED
THE SECOND OF THE THREE ARGUMENTS 'THAT THE JUST DOES NOT AIM AT
EXCESS HAS A REAL MEANING THOUGH WRAPPED UP IN AN ENIGMATICAL FORM
THAT THE GOOD IS OF THE NATURE OF THE FINITE IS A PECULIARLY HELLENIC
SENTIMENT WHICH MAY BE COMPARED WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THOSE MODERN
WRITERS WHO SPEAK OF VIRTUE AS FITNESS AND OF FREEDOM AS OBEDIENCE TO
LAW
THE MATHEMATICAL OR LOGICAL NOTION OF LIMIT EASILY PASSES INTO AN
ETHICAL ONE AND EVEN FINDS A MYTHOLOGICAL EXPRESSION IN THE CONCEPTION
OF ENVY GREEK
IDEAS OF MEASURE EQUALITY ORDER UNITY PROPORTION
STILL LINGER IN THE WRITINGS OF MORALISTS AND THE TRUE SPIRIT OF THE
FINE ARTS IS BETTER CONVEYED BY SUCH TERMS THAN BY SUPERLATIVES
'WHEN WORKMEN STRIVE TO DO BETTER THAN WELL
THEY DO CONFOUND THEIR SKILL IN COVETOUSNESS KING JOHN
THE HARMONY OF THE SOUL AND BODY AND OF THE PARTS OF THE SOUL WITH
ONE ANOTHER A HARMONY 'FAIRER THAN THAT OF MUSICAL NOTES IS THE TRUE
HELLENIC MODE OF CONCEIVING THE PERFECTION OF HUMAN NATURE
IN WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE EPILOGUE OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THRASYMACHUS
PLATO ARGUES THAT EVIL IS NOT A PRINCIPLE OF STRENGTH BUT OF DISCORD
AND DISSOLUTION JUST TOUCHING THE QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN OFTEN TREATED
IN MODERN TIMES BY THEOLOGIANS AND PHILOSOPHERS OF THE NEGATIVE NATURE
OF EVIL
IN THE LAST ARGUMENT WE TRACE THE GERM OF THE ARISTOTELIAN
DOCTRINE OF AN END AND A VIRTUE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE END WHICH AGAIN IS
SUGGESTED BY THE ARTS
THE FINAL RECONCILEMENT OF JUSTICE AND HAPPINESS
AND THE IDENTITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE ARE ALSO INTIMATED
SOCRATES REASSUMES THE CHARACTER OF A 'KNOW NOTHING AT THE SAME TIME
HE APPEARS TO BE NOT WHOLLY SATISFIED WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE
ARGUMENT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED
NOTHING IS CONCLUDED BUT THE TENDENCY OF
THE DIALECTICAL PROCESS HERE AS ALWAYS IS TO ENLARGE OUR CONCEPTION OF
IDEAS AND TO WIDEN THEIR APPLICATION TO HUMAN LIFE
BOOK II
THRASYMACHUS IS PACIFIED BUT THE INTREPID GLAUCON INSISTS ON
CONTINUING THE ARGUMENT
HE IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE INDIRECT MANNER
IN WHICH AT THE END OF THE LAST BOOK SOCRATES HAD DISPOSED OF THE
QUESTION 'WHETHER THE JUST OR THE UNJUST IS THE HAPPIER HE BEGINS
BY DIVIDING GOODS INTO THREE CLASSES FIRST GOODS DESIRABLE IN
THEMSELVES SECONDLY GOODS DESIRABLE IN THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR
RESULTS THIRDLY GOODS DESIRABLE FOR THEIR RESULTS ONLY
HE THEN ASKS
SOCRATES IN WHICH OF THE THREE CLASSES HE WOULD PLACE JUSTICE
IN THE
SECOND CLASS REPLIES SOCRATES AMONG GOODS DESIRABLE FOR THEMSELVES AND
ALSO FOR THEIR RESULTS
'THEN THE WORLD IN GENERAL ARE OF ANOTHER MIND
FOR THEY SAY THAT JUSTICE BELONGS TO THE TROUBLESOME CLASS OF GOODS
WHICH ARE DESIRABLE FOR THEIR RESULTS ONLY
SOCRATES ANSWERS THAT THIS
IS THE DOCTRINE OF THRASYMACHUS WHICH HE REJECTS
GLAUCON THINKS THAT
THRASYMACHUS WAS TOO READY TO LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE CHARMER AND
PROPOSES TO CONSIDER THE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE IN THEMSELVES
AND APART FROM THE RESULTS AND REWARDS OF THEM WHICH THE WORLD IS ALWAYS
DINNING IN HIS EARS
HE WILL FIRST OF ALL SPEAK OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN
OF JUSTICE SECONDLY OF THE MANNER IN WHICH MEN VIEW JUSTICE AS A
NECESSITY AND NOT A GOOD AND THIRDLY HE WILL PROVE THE REASONABLENESS
OF THIS VIEW
'TO DO INJUSTICE IS SAID TO BE A GOOD TO SUFFER INJUSTICE AN EVIL
AS
THE EVIL IS DISCOVERED BY EXPERIENCE TO BE GREATER THAN THE GOOD THE
SUFFERERS WHO CANNOT ALSO BE DOERS MAKE A COMPACT THAT THEY WILL HAVE
NEITHER AND THIS COMPACT OR MEAN IS CALLED JUSTICE BUT IS REALLY THE
IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING INJUSTICE
NO ONE WOULD OBSERVE SUCH A COMPACT
IF HE WERE NOT OBLIGED
LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE JUST AND UNJUST HAVE
TWO RINGS LIKE THAT OF GYGES IN THE WELL KNOWN STORY WHICH MAKE THEM
INVISIBLE AND THEN NO DIFFERENCE WILL APPEAR IN THEM FOR EVERY ONE
WILL DO EVIL IF HE CAN
AND HE WHO ABSTAINS WILL BE REGARDED BY THE
WORLD AS A FOOL FOR HIS PAINS
MEN MAY PRAISE HIM IN PUBLIC OUT OF
FEAR FOR THEMSELVES BUT THEY WILL LAUGH AT HIM IN THEIR HEARTS CP
GORGIAS
'AND NOW LET US FRAME AN IDEAL OF THE JUST AND UNJUST
IMAGINE THE
UNJUST MAN TO BE MASTER OF HIS CRAFT SELDOM MAKING MISTAKES AND EASILY
CORRECTING THEM HAVING GIFTS OF MONEY SPEECH STRENGTH THE GREATEST
VILLAIN BEARING THE HIGHEST CHARACTER AND AT HIS SIDE LET US PLACE THE
JUST IN HIS NOBLENESS AND SIMPLICITY BEING NOT SEEMING WITHOUT NAME
OR REWARD CLOTHED IN HIS JUSTICE ONLY THE BEST OF MEN WHO IS THOUGHT
TO BE THE WORST AND LET HIM DIE AS HE HAS LIVED
I MIGHT ADD BUT
I WOULD RATHER PUT THE REST INTO THE MOUTH OF THE PANEGYRISTS OF
INJUSTICE THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THE JUST MAN WILL BE SCOURGED
RACKED BOUND WILL HAVE HIS EYES PUT OUT AND WILL AT LAST BE CRUCIFIED
LITERALLY IMPALED AND ALL THIS BECAUSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE PREFERRED
SEEMING TO BEING
HOW DIFFERENT IS THE CASE OF THE UNJUST WHO CLINGS TO
APPEARANCE AS THE TRUE REALITY HIS HIGH CHARACTER MAKES HIM A RULER
HE CAN MARRY WHERE HE LIKES TRADE WHERE HE LIKES HELP HIS FRIENDS AND
HURT HIS ENEMIES HAVING GOT RICH BY DISHONESTY HE CAN WORSHIP THE GODS
BETTER AND WILL THEREFORE BE MORE LOVED BY THEM THAN THE JUST
I WAS THINKING WHAT TO ANSWER WHEN ADEIMANTUS JOINED IN THE ALREADY
UNEQUAL FRAY
HE CONSIDERED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF ALL HAD
BEEN OMITTED 'MEN ARE TAUGHT TO BE JUST FOR THE SAKE OF REWARDS
PARENTS AND GUARDIANS MAKE REPUTATION THE INCENTIVE TO VIRTUE
AND OTHER
ADVANTAGES ARE PROMISED BY THEM OF A MORE SOLID KIND SUCH AS WEALTHY
MARRIAGES AND HIGH OFFICES
THERE ARE THE PICTURES IN HOMER AND HESIOD
OF FAT SHEEP AND HEAVY FLEECES RICH CORN FIELDS AND TREES TOPPLING WITH
FRUIT WHICH THE GODS PROVIDE IN THIS LIFE FOR THE JUST
AND THE ORPHIC
POETS ADD A SIMILAR PICTURE OF ANOTHER
THE HEROES OF MUSAEUS AND
EUMOLPUS LIE ON COUCHES AT A FESTIVAL WITH GARLANDS ON THEIR HEADS
ENJOYING AS THE MEED OF VIRTUE A PARADISE OF IMMORTAL DRUNKENNESS
SOME GO FURTHER AND SPEAK OF A FAIR POSTERITY IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH
GENERATION
BUT THE WICKED THEY BURY IN A SLOUGH AND MAKE THEM CARRY
WATER IN A SIEVE AND IN THIS LIFE THEY ATTRIBUTE TO THEM THE INFAMY
WHICH GLAUCON WAS ASSUMING TO BE THE LOT OF THE JUST WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE UNJUST
'TAKE ANOTHER KIND OF ARGUMENT WHICH IS FOUND BOTH IN POETRY AND
PROSE VIRTUE AS HESIOD SAYS IS HONOURABLE BUT DIFFICULT VICE IS
EASY AND PROFITABLE YOU MAY OFTEN SEE THE WICKED IN GREAT PROSPERITY
AND THE RIGHTEOUS AFFLICTED BY THE WILL OF HEAVEN
AND MENDICANT
PROPHETS KNOCK AT RICH MEN'S DOORS PROMISING TO ATONE FOR THE SINS
OF THEMSELVES OR THEIR FATHERS IN AN EASY FASHION WITH SACRIFICES AND
FESTIVE GAMES OR WITH CHARMS AND INVOCATIONS TO GET RID OF AN ENEMY
GOOD OR BAD BY DIVINE HELP AND AT A SMALL CHARGE THEY APPEAL TO BOOKS
PROFESSING TO BE WRITTEN BY MUSAEUS AND ORPHEUS AND CARRY AWAY THE
MINDS OF WHOLE CITIES AND PROMISE TO GET SOULS OUT OF PURGATORY AND
IF WE REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THEM NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US
'WHEN A LIVELY MINDED INGENUOUS YOUTH HEARS ALL THIS WHAT WILL BE HIS
CONCLUSION WILL HE IN THE LANGUAGE OF PINDAR MAKE JUSTICE HIS HIGH
TOWER OR FORTIFY HIMSELF WITH CROOKED DECEIT JUSTICE HE REFLECTS
WITHOUT THE APPEARANCE OF JUSTICE IS MISERY AND RUIN INJUSTICE HAS THE
PROMISE OF A GLORIOUS LIFE
APPEARANCE IS MASTER OF TRUTH AND LORD OF
HAPPINESS
TO APPEARANCE THEN I WILL TURN I WILL PUT ON THE SHOW
OF VIRTUE AND TRAIL BEHIND ME THE FOX OF ARCHILOCHUS
I HEAR SOME ONE
SAYING THAT WICKEDNESS IS NOT EASILY CONCEALED TO WHICH I REPLY THAT
NOTHING GREAT IS EASY UNION AND FORCE AND RHETORIC WILL DO MUCH AND
IF MEN SAY THAT THEY CANNOT PREVAIL OVER THE GODS STILL HOW DO WE KNOW
THAT THERE ARE GODS ONLY FROM THE POETS WHO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY MAY
BE APPEASED BY SACRIFICES
THEN WHY NOT SIN AND PAY FOR INDULGENCES OUT
OF YOUR SIN FOR IF THE RIGHTEOUS ARE ONLY UNPUNISHED STILL THEY HAVE
NO FURTHER REWARD WHILE THE WICKED MAY BE UNPUNISHED AND HAVE THE
PLEASURE OF SINNING TOO
BUT WHAT OF THE WORLD BELOW NAY SAYS THE
ARGUMENT THERE ARE ATONING POWERS WHO WILL SET THAT MATTER RIGHT AS
THE POETS WHO ARE THE SONS OF THE GODS TELL US AND THIS IS CONFIRMED
BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE
'HOW CAN WE RESIST SUCH ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF INJUSTICE ADD GOOD
MANNERS AND AS THE WISE TELL US WE SHALL MAKE THE BEST OF BOTH
WORLDS
WHO THAT IS NOT A MISERABLE CAITIFF WILL REFRAIN FROM SMILING AT
THE PRAISES OF JUSTICE EVEN IF A MAN KNOWS THE BETTER PART HE WILL NOT
BE ANGRY WITH OTHERS FOR HE KNOWS ALSO THAT MORE THAN HUMAN VIRTUE IS
NEEDED TO SAVE A MAN AND THAT HE ONLY PRAISES JUSTICE WHO IS INCAPABLE
OF INJUSTICE
'THE ORIGIN OF THE EVIL IS THAT ALL MEN FROM THE BEGINNING HEROES
POETS INSTRUCTORS OF YOUTH HAVE ALWAYS ASSERTED THE TEMPORAL
DISPENSATION THE HONOURS AND PROFITS OF JUSTICE
HAD WE BEEN TAUGHT IN
EARLY YOUTH THE POWER OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE INHERENT IN THE SOUL AND
UNSEEN BY ANY HUMAN OR DIVINE EYE WE SHOULD NOT HAVE NEEDED OTHERS TO
BE OUR GUARDIANS BUT EVERY ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GUARDIAN OF HIMSELF
THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO SHOW SOCRATES OTHER MEN USE ARGUMENTS
WHICH RATHER TEND TO STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF THRASYMACHUS THAT MIGHT
IS RIGHT BUT FROM YOU I EXPECT BETTER THINGS
AND PLEASE AS GLAUCON
SAID TO EXCLUDE REPUTATION LET THE JUST BE THOUGHT UNJUST AND THE
UNJUST JUST AND DO YOU STILL PROVE TO US THE SUPERIORITY OF JUSTICE'
THE THESIS WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT HAS BEEN MAINTAINED BY
GLAUCON IS THE CONVERSE OF THAT OF THRASYMACHUS NOT RIGHT IS THE
INTEREST OF THE STRONGER BUT RIGHT IS THE NECESSITY OF THE WEAKER
STARTING FROM THE SAME PREMISES HE CARRIES THE ANALYSIS OF SOCIETY A
STEP FURTHER BACK MIGHT IS STILL RIGHT BUT THE MIGHT IS THE WEAKNESS
OF THE MANY COMBINED AGAINST THE STRENGTH OF THE FEW
THERE HAVE BEEN THEORIES IN MODERN AS WELL AS IN ANCIENT TIMES WHICH
HAVE A FAMILY LIKENESS TO THE SPECULATIONS OF GLAUCON E G
THAT POWER
IS THE FOUNDATION OF RIGHT OR THAT A MONARCH HAS A DIVINE RIGHT TO
GOVERN WELL OR ILL OR THAT VIRTUE IS SELF LOVE OR THE LOVE OF POWER OR
THAT WAR IS THE NATURAL STATE OF MAN OR THAT PRIVATE VICES ARE PUBLIC
BENEFITS
ALL SUCH THEORIES HAVE A KIND OF PLAUSIBILITY FROM THEIR
PARTIAL AGREEMENT WITH EXPERIENCE
FOR HUMAN NATURE OSCILLATES BETWEEN
GOOD AND EVIL AND THE MOTIVES OF ACTIONS AND THE ORIGIN OF INSTITUTIONS
MAY BE EXPLAINED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ON EITHER HYPOTHESIS ACCORDING TO
THE CHARACTER OR POINT OF VIEW OF A PARTICULAR THINKER
THE OBLIGATION
OF MAINTAINING AUTHORITY UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SOMETIMES BY RATHER
QUESTIONABLE MEANS IS FELT STRONGLY AND HAS BECOME A SORT OF INSTINCT
AMONG CIVILIZED MEN
THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS OR MORE GENERALLY OF
GOVERNMENTS IS ONE OF THE FORMS UNDER WHICH THIS NATURAL FEELING IS
EXPRESSED
NOR AGAIN IS THERE ANY EVIL WHICH HAS NOT SOME ACCOMPANIMENT
OF GOOD OR PLEASURE NOR ANY GOOD WHICH IS FREE FROM SOME ALLOY OF EVIL
NOR ANY NOBLE OR GENEROUS THOUGHT WHICH MAY NOT BE ATTENDED BY A SHADOW
OR THE GHOST OF A SHADOW OF SELF INTEREST OR OF SELF LOVE
WE KNOW THAT
ALL HUMAN ACTIONS ARE IMPERFECT BUT WE DO NOT THEREFORE ATTRIBUTE
THEM TO THE WORSE RATHER THAN TO THE BETTER MOTIVE OR PRINCIPLE
SUCH
A PHILOSOPHY IS BOTH FOOLISH AND FALSE LIKE THAT OPINION OF THE CLEVER
ROGUE WHO ASSUMES ALL OTHER MEN TO BE LIKE HIMSELF
AND THEORIES OF THIS
SORT DO NOT REPRESENT THE REAL NATURE OF THE STATE WHICH IS BASED ON A
VAGUE SENSE OF RIGHT GRADUALLY CORRECTED AND ENLARGED BY CUSTOM AND LAW
ALTHOUGH CAPABLE ALSO OF PERVERSION ANY MORE THAN THEY DESCRIBE THE
ORIGIN OF SOCIETY WHICH IS TO BE SOUGHT IN THE FAMILY AND IN THE
SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF MAN
NOR DO THEY REPRESENT THE AVERAGE
CHARACTER OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED SIMPLY ON A THEORY
OF EVIL BUT HAS ALWAYS A COUNTERACTING ELEMENT OF GOOD
AND AS MEN
BECOME BETTER SUCH THEORIES APPEAR MORE AND MORE UNTRUTHFUL TO THEM
BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE CONSCIOUS OF THEIR OWN DISINTERESTEDNESS
A LITTLE
EXPERIENCE MAY MAKE A MAN A CYNIC A GREAT DEAL WILL BRING HIM BACK TO
A TRUER AND KINDLIER VIEW OF THE MIXED NATURE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FELLOW
MEN
THE TWO BROTHERS ASK SOCRATES TO PROVE TO THEM THAT THE JUST IS HAPPY
WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN FROM HIM ALL THAT IN WHICH HAPPINESS IS ORDINARILY
SUPPOSED TO CONSIST
NOT THAT THERE IS 1 ANY ABSURDITY IN THE ATTEMPT
TO FRAME A NOTION OF JUSTICE APART FROM CIRCUMSTANCES
FOR THE IDEAL
MUST ALWAYS BE A PARADOX WHEN COMPARED WITH THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF
HUMAN LIFE
NEITHER THE STOICAL IDEAL NOR THE CHRISTIAN IDEAL IS TRUE AS
A FACT BUT THEY MAY SERVE AS A BASIS OF EDUCATION AND MAY EXERCISE AN
ENNOBLING INFLUENCE
AN IDEAL IS NONE THE WORSE BECAUSE 'SOME ONE HAS
MADE THE DISCOVERY' THAT NO SUCH IDEAL WAS EVER REALIZED
AND IN A
FEW EXCEPTIONAL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RAISED ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF
HUMANITY THE IDEAL OF HAPPINESS MAY BE REALIZED IN DEATH AND MISERY
THIS MAY BE THE STATE WHICH THE REASON DELIBERATELY APPROVES AND WHICH
THE UTILITARIAN AS WELL AS EVERY OTHER MORALIST MAY BE BOUND IN CERTAIN
CASES TO PREFER
NOR AGAIN 2 MUST WE FORGET THAT PLATO THOUGH HE AGREES GENERALLY
WITH THE VIEW IMPLIED IN THE ARGUMENT OF THE TWO BROTHERS IS NOT
EXPRESSING HIS OWN FINAL CONCLUSION BUT RATHER SEEKING TO DRAMATIZE ONE
OF THE ASPECTS OF ETHICAL TRUTH
HE IS DEVELOPING HIS IDEA GRADUALLY IN
A SERIES OF POSITIONS OR SITUATIONS
HE IS EXHIBITING SOCRATES FOR THE
FIRST TIME UNDERGOING THE SOCRATIC INTERROGATION
LASTLY 3 THE WORD
'HAPPINESS' INVOLVES SOME DEGREE OF CONFUSION BECAUSE ASSOCIATED IN THE
LANGUAGE OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY WITH CONSCIOUS PLEASURE OR SATISFACTION
WHICH WAS NOT EQUALLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
GLAUCON HAS BEEN DRAWING A PICTURE OF THE MISERY OF THE JUST AND THE
HAPPINESS OF THE UNJUST TO WHICH THE MISERY OF THE TYRANT IN BOOK IX IS
THE ANSWER AND PARALLEL
AND STILL THE UNJUST MUST APPEAR JUST THAT IS
'THE HOMAGE WHICH VICE PAYS TO VIRTUE BUT NOW ADEIMANTUS TAKING UP
THE HINT WHICH HAD BEEN ALREADY GIVEN BY GLAUCON PROCEEDS TO SHOW
THAT IN THE OPINION OF MANKIND JUSTICE IS REGARDED ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF
REWARDS AND REPUTATION AND POINTS OUT THE ADVANTAGE WHICH IS GIVEN TO
SUCH ARGUMENTS AS THOSE OF THRASYMACHUS AND GLAUCON BY THE CONVENTIONAL
MORALITY OF MANKIND
HE SEEMS TO FEEL THE DIFFICULTY OF 'JUSTIFYING THE
WAYS OF GOD TO MAN BOTH THE BROTHERS TOUCH UPON THE QUESTION WHETHER
THE MORALITY OF ACTIONS IS DETERMINED BY THEIR CONSEQUENCES AND BOTH
OF THEM GO BEYOND THE POSITION OF SOCRATES THAT JUSTICE BELONGS TO
THE CLASS OF GOODS NOT DESIRABLE FOR THEMSELVES ONLY BUT DESIRABLE FOR
THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR RESULTS TO WHICH HE RECALLS THEM
IN
THEIR ATTEMPT TO VIEW JUSTICE AS AN INTERNAL PRINCIPLE AND IN THEIR
CONDEMNATION OF THE POETS THEY ANTICIPATE HIM
THE COMMON LIFE OF
GREECE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THEM THEY MUST PENETRATE DEEPER INTO THE
NATURE OF THINGS
IT HAS BEEN OBJECTED THAT JUSTICE IS HONESTY IN THE SENSE OF GLAUCON AND
ADEIMANTUS BUT IS TAKEN BY SOCRATES TO MEAN ALL VIRTUE
MAY WE NOT
MORE TRULY SAY THAT THE OLD FASHIONED NOTION OF JUSTICE IS ENLARGED BY
SOCRATES AND BECOMES EQUIVALENT TO UNIVERSAL ORDER OR WELL BEING FIRST
IN THE STATE AND SECONDLY IN THE INDIVIDUAL HE HAS FOUND A NEW ANSWER
TO HIS OLD QUESTION PROTAG 'WHETHER THE VIRTUES ARE ONE OR MANY
VIZ
THAT ONE IS THE ORDERING PRINCIPLE OF THE THREE OTHERS
IN SEEKING
TO ESTABLISH THE PURELY INTERNAL NATURE OF JUSTICE HE IS MET BY THE
FACT THAT MAN IS A SOCIAL BEING AND HE TRIES TO HARMONISE THE TWO
OPPOSITE THESES AS WELL AS HE CAN
THERE IS NO MORE INCONSISTENCY IN
THIS THAN WAS INEVITABLE IN HIS AGE AND COUNTRY THERE IS NO USE IN
TURNING UPON HIM THE CROSS LIGHTS OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY WHICH FROM SOME
OTHER POINT OF VIEW WOULD APPEAR EQUALLY INCONSISTENT
PLATO DOES NOT
GIVE THE FINAL SOLUTION OF PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS FOR US NOR CAN HE BE
JUDGED OF BY OUR STANDARD
THE REMAINDER OF THE REPUBLIC IS DEVELOPED OUT OF THE QUESTION OF
THE SONS OF ARISTON
THREE POINTS ARE DESERVING OF REMARK IN WHAT
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE ANSWER OF SOCRATES IS ALTOGETHER
INDIRECT
HE DOES NOT SAY THAT HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN THE CONTEMPLATION
OF THE IDEA OF JUSTICE AND STILL LESS WILL HE BE TEMPTED TO AFFIRM THE
STOICAL PARADOX THAT THE JUST MAN CAN BE HAPPY ON THE RACK
BUT FIRST HE
DWELLS ON THE DIFFICULTY OF THE PROBLEM AND INSISTS ON RESTORING MAN TO
HIS NATURAL CONDITION BEFORE HE WILL ANSWER THE QUESTION AT ALL
HE
TOO WILL FRAME AN IDEAL BUT HIS IDEAL COMPREHENDS NOT ONLY ABSTRACT
JUSTICE BUT THE WHOLE RELATIONS OF MAN
UNDER THE FANCIFUL ILLUSTRATION
OF THE LARGE LETTERS HE IMPLIES THAT HE WILL ONLY LOOK FOR JUSTICE IN
SOCIETY AND THAT FROM THE STATE HE WILL PROCEED TO THE INDIVIDUAL
HIS
ANSWER IN SUBSTANCE AMOUNTS TO THIS THAT UNDER FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS
I E
IN THE PERFECT STATE JUSTICE AND HAPPINESS WILL COINCIDE AND THAT
WHEN JUSTICE HAS BEEN ONCE FOUND HAPPINESS MAY BE LEFT TO TAKE CARE
OF ITSELF
THAT HE FALLS INTO SOME DEGREE OF INCONSISTENCY WHEN IN
THE TENTH BOOK HE CLAIMS TO HAVE GOT RID OF THE REWARDS AND HONOURS
OF JUSTICE MAY BE ADMITTED FOR HE HAS LEFT THOSE WHICH EXIST IN THE
PERFECT STATE
AND THE PHILOSOPHER 'WHO RETIRES UNDER THE SHELTER OF A
WALL' CAN HARDLY HAVE BEEN ESTEEMED HAPPY BY HIM AT LEAST NOT IN THIS
WORLD
STILL HE MAINTAINS THE TRUE ATTITUDE OF MORAL ACTION
LET A MAN
DO HIS DUTY FIRST WITHOUT ASKING WHETHER HE WILL BE HAPPY OR NOT AND
HAPPINESS WILL BE THE INSEPARABLE ACCIDENT WHICH ATTENDS HIM
'SEEK YE
FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ALL THESE THINGS
SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU
SECONDLY IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT PLATO PRESERVES THE GENUINE CHARACTER
OF GREEK THOUGHT IN BEGINNING WITH THE STATE AND IN GOING ON TO THE
INDIVIDUAL
FIRST ETHICS THEN POLITICS THIS IS THE ORDER OF IDEAS TO
US THE REVERSE IS THE ORDER OF HISTORY
ONLY AFTER MANY STRUGGLES OF
THOUGHT DOES THE INDIVIDUAL ASSERT HIS RIGHT AS A MORAL BEING
IN EARLY
AGES HE IS NOT ONE BUT ONE OF MANY THE CITIZEN OF A STATE WHICH IS
PRIOR TO HIM AND HE HAS NO NOTION OF GOOD OR EVIL APART FROM THE LAW
OF HIS COUNTRY OR THE CREED OF HIS CHURCH
AND TO THIS TYPE HE IS
CONSTANTLY TENDING TO REVERT WHENEVER THE INFLUENCE OF CUSTOM OR OF
PARTY SPIRIT OR THE RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST BECOMES TOO STRONG FOR
HIM
THIRDLY WE MAY OBSERVE THE CONFUSION OR IDENTIFICATION OF THE
INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE OF ETHICS AND POLITICS WHICH PERVADES EARLY
GREEK SPECULATION AND EVEN IN MODERN TIMES RETAINS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF
INFLUENCE
THE SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL
ACTION OF MANKIND SEEMS TO HAVE ESCAPED EARLY THINKERS AND WE TOO ARE
SOMETIMES IN DANGER OF FORGETTING THE CONDITIONS OF UNITED HUMAN ACTION
WHENEVER WE EITHER ELEVATE POLITICS INTO ETHICS OR LOWER ETHICS TO THE
STANDARD OF POLITICS
THE GOOD MAN AND THE GOOD CITIZEN ONLY COINCIDE IN
THE PERFECT STATE AND THIS PERFECTION CANNOT BE ATTAINED BY LEGISLATION
ACTING UPON THEM FROM WITHOUT BUT IF AT ALL BY EDUCATION FASHIONING
THEM FROM WITHIN
SOCRATES PRAISES THE SONS OF ARISTON 'INSPIRED OFFSPRING OF
THE RENOWNED HERO AS THE ELEGIAC POET TERMS THEM BUT HE DOES NOT
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN ARGUE SO ELOQUENTLY ON BEHALF OF INJUSTICE WHILE
THEIR CHARACTER SHOWS THAT THEY ARE UNINFLUENCED BY THEIR OWN ARGUMENTS
HE KNOWS NOT HOW TO ANSWER THEM ALTHOUGH HE IS AFRAID OF DESERTING
JUSTICE IN THE HOUR OF NEED
HE THEREFORE MAKES A CONDITION THAT HAVING
WEAK EYES HE SHALL BE ALLOWED TO READ THE LARGE LETTERS FIRST AND THEN
GO ON TO THE SMALLER THAT IS HE MUST LOOK FOR JUSTICE IN THE STATE
FIRST AND WILL THEN PROCEED TO THE INDIVIDUAL
ACCORDINGLY HE BEGINS TO
CONSTRUCT THE STATE
SOCIETY ARISES OUT OF THE WANTS OF MAN
HIS FIRST WANT IS FOOD HIS
SECOND A HOUSE HIS THIRD A COAT
THE SENSE OF THESE NEEDS AND THE
POSSIBILITY OF SATISFYING THEM BY EXCHANGE DRAW INDIVIDUALS TOGETHER ON
THE SAME SPOT AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A STATE WHICH WE TAKE THE
LIBERTY TO INVENT ALTHOUGH NECESSITY IS THE REAL INVENTOR
THERE MUST
BE FIRST A HUSBANDMAN SECONDLY A BUILDER THIRDLY A WEAVER TO WHICH
MAY BE ADDED A COBBLER
FOUR OR FIVE CITIZENS AT LEAST ARE REQUIRED TO
MAKE A CITY
NOW MEN HAVE DIFFERENT NATURES AND ONE MAN WILL DO ONE
THING BETTER THAN MANY AND BUSINESS WAITS FOR NO MAN
HENCE THERE MUST
BE A DIVISION OF LABOUR INTO DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENTS INTO WHOLESALE
AND RETAIL TRADE INTO WORKERS AND MAKERS OF WORKMEN'S TOOLS INTO
SHEPHERDS AND HUSBANDMEN
A CITY WHICH INCLUDES ALL THIS WILL HAVE FAR
EXCEEDED THE LIMIT OF FOUR OR FIVE AND YET NOT BE VERY LARGE
BUT THEN
AGAIN IMPORTS WILL BE REQUIRED AND IMPORTS NECESSITATE EXPORTS
AND THIS IMPLIES VARIETY OF PRODUCE IN ORDER TO ATTRACT THE TASTE OF
PURCHASERS ALSO MERCHANTS AND SHIPS
IN THE CITY TOO WE MUST HAVE A
MARKET AND MONEY AND RETAIL TRADES OTHERWISE BUYERS AND SELLERS WILL
NEVER MEET AND THE VALUABLE TIME OF THE PRODUCERS WILL BE WASTED IN
VAIN EFFORTS AT EXCHANGE
IF WE ADD HIRED SERVANTS THE STATE WILL BE
COMPLETE
AND WE MAY GUESS THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE INTERCOURSE OF THE
CITIZENS WITH ONE ANOTHER JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE WILL APPEAR
HERE FOLLOWS A RUSTIC PICTURE OF THEIR WAY OF LIFE
THEY SPEND THEIR
DAYS IN HOUSES WHICH THEY HAVE BUILT FOR THEMSELVES THEY MAKE THEIR
OWN CLOTHES AND PRODUCE THEIR OWN CORN AND WINE
THEIR PRINCIPAL FOOD IS
MEAL AND FLOUR AND THEY DRINK IN MODERATION
THEY LIVE ON THE BEST
OF TERMS WITH EACH OTHER AND TAKE CARE NOT TO HAVE TOO MANY CHILDREN
'BUT SAID GLAUCON INTERPOSING 'ARE THEY NOT TO HAVE A RELISH
CERTAINLY THEY WILL HAVE SALT AND OLIVES AND CHEESE VEGETABLES AND
FRUITS AND CHESTNUTS TO ROAST AT THE FIRE
''TIS A CITY OF PIGS
SOCRATES WHY I REPLIED WHAT DO YOU WANT MORE 'ONLY THE COMFORTS OF
LIFE SOFAS AND TABLES ALSO SAUCES AND SWEETS I SEE YOU WANT NOT
ONLY A STATE BUT A LUXURIOUS STATE AND POSSIBLY IN THE MORE COMPLEX
FRAME WE MAY SOONER FIND JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE
THEN THE FINE ARTS MUST
GO TO WORK EVERY CONCEIVABLE INSTRUMENT AND ORNAMENT OF LUXURY WILL BE
WANTED
THERE WILL BE DANCERS PAINTERS SCULPTORS MUSICIANS COOKS
BARBERS TIRE WOMEN NURSES ARTISTS SWINEHERDS AND NEATHERDS TOO FOR
THE ANIMALS AND PHYSICIANS TO CURE THE DISORDERS OF WHICH LUXURY IS THE
SOURCE
TO FEED ALL THESE SUPERFLUOUS MOUTHS WE SHALL NEED A PART OF
OUR NEIGHBOUR'S LAND AND THEY WILL WANT A PART OF OURS
AND THIS IS THE
ORIGIN OF WAR WHICH MAY BE TRACED TO THE SAME CAUSES AS OTHER POLITICAL
EVILS
OUR CITY WILL NOW REQUIRE THE SLIGHT ADDITION OF A CAMP AND
THE CITIZEN WILL BE CONVERTED INTO A SOLDIER
BUT THEN AGAIN OUR OLD
DOCTRINE OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN
THE ART OF
WAR CANNOT BE LEARNED IN A DAY AND THERE MUST BE A NATURAL APTITUDE
FOR MILITARY DUTIES
THERE WILL BE SOME WARLIKE NATURES WHO HAVE THIS
APTITUDE DOGS KEEN OF SCENT SWIFT OF FOOT TO PURSUE AND STRONG OF
LIMB TO FIGHT
AND AS SPIRIT IS THE FOUNDATION OF COURAGE SUCH NATURES
WHETHER OF MEN OR ANIMALS WILL BE FULL OF SPIRIT
BUT THESE SPIRITED
NATURES ARE APT TO BITE AND DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER THE UNION OF
GENTLENESS TO FRIENDS AND FIERCENESS AGAINST ENEMIES APPEARS TO BE AN
IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE GUARDIAN OF A STATE REQUIRES BOTH QUALITIES
WHO
THEN CAN BE A GUARDIAN THE IMAGE OF THE DOG SUGGESTS AN ANSWER
FOR
DOGS ARE GENTLE TO FRIENDS AND FIERCE TO STRANGERS
YOUR DOG IS A
PHILOSOPHER WHO JUDGES BY THE RULE OF KNOWING OR NOT KNOWING AND
PHILOSOPHY WHETHER IN MAN OR BEAST IS THE PARENT OF GENTLENESS
THE
HUMAN WATCHDOGS MUST BE PHILOSOPHERS OR LOVERS OF LEARNING WHICH WILL
MAKE THEM GENTLE
AND HOW ARE THEY TO BE LEARNED WITHOUT EDUCATION
BUT WHAT SHALL THEIR EDUCATION BE IS ANY BETTER THAN THE OLD FASHIONED
SORT WHICH IS COMPREHENDED UNDER THE NAME OF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC MUSIC
INCLUDES LITERATURE AND LITERATURE IS OF TWO KINDS TRUE AND FALSE
'WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
I MEAN THAT CHILDREN HEAR STORIES BEFORE
THEY LEARN GYMNASTICS AND THAT THE STORIES ARE EITHER UNTRUE OR HAVE
AT MOST ONE OR TWO GRAINS OF TRUTH IN A BUSHEL OF FALSEHOOD
NOW EARLY
LIFE IS VERY IMPRESSIBLE AND CHILDREN OUGHT NOT TO LEARN WHAT THEY WILL
HAVE TO UNLEARN WHEN THEY GROW UP WE MUST THEREFORE HAVE A CENSORSHIP
OF NURSERY TALES BANISHING SOME AND KEEPING OTHERS
SOME OF THEM ARE
VERY IMPROPER AS WE MAY SEE IN THE GREAT INSTANCES OF HOMER AND HESIOD
WHO NOT ONLY TELL LIES BUT BAD LIES STORIES ABOUT URANUS AND SATURN
WHICH ARE IMMORAL AS WELL AS FALSE AND WHICH SHOULD NEVER BE SPOKEN OF
TO YOUNG PERSONS OR INDEED AT ALL OR IF AT ALL THEN IN A MYSTERY
AFTER THE SACRIFICE NOT OF AN ELEUSINIAN PIG BUT OF SOME UNPROCURABLE
ANIMAL
SHALL OUR YOUTH BE ENCOURAGED TO BEAT THEIR FATHERS BY THE
EXAMPLE OF ZEUS OR OUR CITIZENS BE INCITED TO QUARREL BY HEARING OR
SEEING REPRESENTATIONS OF STRIFE AMONG THE GODS SHALL THEY LISTEN TO
THE NARRATIVE OF HEPHAESTUS BINDING HIS MOTHER AND OF ZEUS SENDING HIM
FLYING FOR HELPING HER WHEN SHE WAS BEATEN SUCH TALES MAY POSSIBLY HAVE
A MYSTICAL INTERPRETATION BUT THE YOUNG ARE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING
ALLEGORY
IF ANY ONE ASKS WHAT TALES ARE TO BE ALLOWED WE WILL ANSWER
THAT WE ARE LEGISLATORS AND NOT BOOK MAKERS WE ONLY LAY DOWN THE
PRINCIPLES ACCORDING TO WHICH BOOKS ARE TO BE WRITTEN TO WRITE THEM IS
THE DUTY OF OTHERS
AND OUR FIRST PRINCIPLE IS THAT GOD MUST BE REPRESENTED AS HE IS NOT
AS THE AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS BUT OF GOOD ONLY
WE WILL NOT SUFFER THE
POETS TO SAY THAT HE IS THE STEWARD OF GOOD AND EVIL OR THAT HE HAS TWO
CASKS FULL OF DESTINIES OR THAT ATHENE AND ZEUS INCITED PANDARUS TO
BREAK THE TREATY OR THAT GOD CAUSED THE SUFFERINGS OF NIOBE OR OF
PELOPS OR THE TROJAN WAR OR THAT HE MAKES MEN SIN WHEN HE WISHES TO
DESTROY THEM
EITHER THESE WERE NOT THE ACTIONS OF THE GODS OR GOD WAS
JUST AND MEN WERE THE BETTER FOR BEING PUNISHED
BUT THAT THE DEED WAS
EVIL AND GOD THE AUTHOR IS A WICKED SUICIDAL FICTION WHICH WE WILL
ALLOW NO ONE OLD OR YOUNG TO UTTER
THIS IS OUR FIRST AND GREAT
PRINCIPLE GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF GOOD ONLY
AND THE SECOND PRINCIPLE IS LIKE UNTO IT WITH GOD IS NO VARIABLENESS
OR CHANGE OF FORM
REASON TEACHES US THIS FOR IF WE SUPPOSE A CHANGE
IN GOD HE MUST BE CHANGED EITHER BY ANOTHER OR BY HIMSELF
BY
ANOTHER BUT THE BEST WORKS OF NATURE AND ART AND THE NOBLEST QUALITIES
OF MIND ARE LEAST LIABLE TO BE CHANGED BY ANY EXTERNAL FORCE
BY
HIMSELF BUT HE CANNOT CHANGE FOR THE BETTER HE WILL HARDLY CHANGE
FOR THE WORSE
HE REMAINS FOR EVER FAIREST AND BEST IN HIS OWN IMAGE
THEREFORE WE REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE POETS WHO TELL US OF HERE BEGGING
IN THE LIKENESS OF A PRIESTESS OR OF OTHER DEITIES WHO PROWL ABOUT AT
NIGHT IN STRANGE DISGUISES ALL THAT BLASPHEMOUS NONSENSE WITH WHICH
MOTHERS FOOL THE MANHOOD OUT OF THEIR CHILDREN MUST BE SUPPRESSED
BUT
SOME ONE WILL SAY THAT GOD WHO IS HIMSELF UNCHANGEABLE MAY TAKE A FORM
IN RELATION TO US
WHY SHOULD HE FOR GODS AS WELL AS MEN HATE THE LIE
IN THE SOUL OR PRINCIPLE OF FALSEHOOD AND AS FOR ANY OTHER FORM OF
LYING WHICH IS USED FOR A PURPOSE AND IS REGARDED AS INNOCENT IN CERTAIN
EXCEPTIONAL CASES WHAT NEED HAVE THE GODS OF THIS FOR THEY ARE NOT
IGNORANT OF ANTIQUITY LIKE THE POETS NOR ARE THEY AFRAID OF THEIR
ENEMIES NOR IS ANY MADMAN A FRIEND OF THEIRS
GOD THEN IS TRUE HE IS
ABSOLUTELY TRUE HE CHANGES NOT HE DECEIVES NOT BY DAY OR NIGHT BY
WORD OR SIGN
THIS IS OUR SECOND GREAT PRINCIPLE GOD IS TRUE
AWAY
WITH THE LYING DREAM OF AGAMEMNON IN HOMER AND THE ACCUSATION OF THETIS
AGAINST APOLLO IN AESCHYLUS
IN ORDER TO GIVE CLEARNESS TO HIS CONCEPTION OF THE STATE PLATO
PROCEEDS TO TRACE THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF MUTUAL NEED AND OF DIVISION
OF LABOUR IN AN IMAGINARY COMMUNITY OF FOUR OR FIVE CITIZENS
GRADUALLY
THIS COMMUNITY INCREASES THE DIVISION OF LABOUR EXTENDS TO COUNTRIES
IMPORTS NECESSITATE EXPORTS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE IS REQUIRED AND
RETAILERS SIT IN THE MARKET PLACE TO SAVE THE TIME OF THE PRODUCERS
THESE ARE THE STEPS BY WHICH PLATO CONSTRUCTS THE FIRST OR PRIMITIVE
STATE INTRODUCING THE ELEMENTS OF POLITICAL ECONOMY BY THE WAY
AS
HE IS GOING TO FRAME A SECOND OR CIVILIZED STATE THE SIMPLE NATURALLY
COMES BEFORE THE COMPLEX
HE INDULGES LIKE ROUSSEAU IN A PICTURE OF
PRIMITIVE LIFE AN IDEA WHICH HAS INDEED OFTEN HAD A POWERFUL INFLUENCE
ON THE IMAGINATION OF MANKIND BUT HE DOES NOT SERIOUSLY MEAN TO SAY
THAT ONE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER POLITICUS NOR CAN ANY INFERENCE
BE DRAWN FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FIRST STATE TAKEN APART FROM THE
SECOND SUCH AS ARISTOTLE APPEARS TO DRAW IN THE POLITICS
WE SHOULD NOT
INTERPRET A PLATONIC DIALOGUE ANY MORE THAN A POEM OR A PARABLE IN TOO
LITERAL OR MATTER OF FACT A STYLE
ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN WE COMPARE
THE LIVELY FANCY OF PLATO WITH THE DRIED UP ABSTRACTIONS OF MODERN
TREATISES ON PHILOSOPHY WE ARE COMPELLED TO SAY WITH PROTAGORAS THAT
THE 'MYTHUS IS MORE INTERESTING' PROTAG
SEVERAL INTERESTING REMARKS WHICH IN MODERN TIMES WOULD HAVE A PLACE IN
A TREATISE ON POLITICAL ECONOMY ARE SCATTERED UP AND DOWN THE WRITINGS
OF PLATO ESPECIALLY LAWS POPULATION FREE TRADE ADULTERATION WILLS
AND BEQUESTS BEGGING ERYXIAS THOUGH NOT PLATO'S VALUE AND DEMAND
REPUBLIC DIVISION OF LABOUR
THE LAST SUBJECT AND ALSO THE ORIGIN OF
RETAIL TRADE IS TREATED WITH ADMIRABLE LUCIDITY IN THE SECOND BOOK OF
THE REPUBLIC
BUT PLATO NEVER COMBINED HIS ECONOMIC IDEAS INTO A SYSTEM
AND NEVER SEEMS TO HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT TRADE IS ONE OF THE GREAT MOTIVE
POWERS OF THE STATE AND OF THE WORLD
HE WOULD MAKE RETAIL TRADERS
ONLY OF THE INFERIOR SORT OF CITIZENS REP LAWS THOUGH HE REMARKS
QUAINTLY ENOUGH LAWS THAT 'IF ONLY THE BEST MEN AND THE BEST WOMEN
EVERYWHERE WERE COMPELLED TO KEEP TAVERNS FOR A TIME OR TO CARRY ON
RETAIL TRADE ETC THEN WE SHOULD KNEW HOW PLEASANT AND AGREEABLE ALL
THESE THINGS ARE
THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF GLAUCON AT THE 'CITY OF PIGS THE LUDICROUS
DESCRIPTION OF THE MINISTERS OF LUXURY IN THE MORE REFINED STATE AND
THE AFTERTHOUGHT OF THE NECESSITY OF DOCTORS THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE
NATURE OF THE GUARDIAN TAKEN FROM THE DOG THE DESIRABLENESS OF
OFFERING SOME ALMOST UNPROCURABLE VICTIM WHEN IMPURE MYSTERIES ARE TO BE
CELEBRATED THE BEHAVIOUR OF ZEUS TO HIS FATHER AND OF HEPHAESTUS TO
HIS MOTHER ARE TOUCHES OF HUMOUR WHICH HAVE ALSO A SERIOUS MEANING
IN
SPEAKING OF EDUCATION PLATO RATHER STARTLES US BY AFFIRMING THAT A CHILD
MUST BE TRAINED IN FALSEHOOD FIRST AND IN TRUTH AFTERWARDS
YET THIS IS
NOT VERY DIFFERENT FROM SAYING THAT CHILDREN MUST BE TAUGHT THROUGH
THE MEDIUM OF IMAGINATION AS WELL AS REASON THAT THEIR MINDS CAN ONLY
DEVELOPE GRADUALLY AND THAT THERE IS MUCH WHICH THEY MUST LEARN WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING
THIS IS ALSO THE SUBSTANCE OF PLATO'S VIEW THOUGH HE
MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE DRAWN THE LINE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY FROM
MODERN ETHICAL WRITERS RESPECTING TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD
TO US ECONOMIES
OR ACCOMMODATIONS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWABLE UNLESS THEY WERE REQUIRED BY
THE HUMAN FACULTIES OR NECESSARY FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF KNOWLEDGE TO
THE SIMPLE AND IGNORANT
WE SHOULD INSIST THAT THE WORD WAS INSEPARABLE
FROM THE INTENTION AND THAT WE MUST NOT BE 'FALSELY TRUE I E
SPEAK
OR ACT FALSELY IN SUPPORT OF WHAT WAS RIGHT OR TRUE
BUT PLATO WOULD
LIMIT THE USE OF FICTIONS ONLY BY REQUIRING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A GOOD
MORAL EFFECT AND THAT SUCH A DANGEROUS WEAPON AS FALSEHOOD SHOULD BE
EMPLOYED BY THE RULERS ALONE AND FOR GREAT OBJECTS
A GREEK IN THE AGE OF PLATO ATTACHED NO IMPORTANCE TO THE QUESTION
WHETHER HIS RELIGION WAS AN HISTORICAL FACT
HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO BE
CONSCIOUS THAT THE PAST HAD A HISTORY BUT HE COULD SEE NOTHING BEYOND
HOMER AND HESIOD
WHETHER THEIR NARRATIVES WERE TRUE OR FALSE DID NOT
SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE POLITICAL OR SOCIAL LIFE OF HELLAS
MEN ONLY BEGAN
TO SUSPECT THAT THEY WERE FICTIONS WHEN THEY RECOGNISED THEM TO BE
IMMORAL
AND SO IN ALL RELIGIONS THE CONSIDERATION OF THEIR MORALITY
COMES FIRST AFTERWARDS THE TRUTH OF THE DOCUMENTS IN WHICH THEY ARE
RECORDED OR OF THE EVENTS NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL WHICH ARE TOLD OF
THEM
BUT IN MODERN TIMES AND IN PROTESTANT COUNTRIES PERHAPS MORE THAN
IN CATHOLIC WE HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH INCLINED TO IDENTIFY THE HISTORICAL
WITH THE MORAL AND SOME HAVE REFUSED TO BELIEVE IN RELIGION AT ALL
UNLESS A SUPERHUMAN ACCURACY WAS DISCERNIBLE IN EVERY PART OF THE
RECORD
THE FACTS OF AN ANCIENT OR RELIGIOUS HISTORY ARE AMONGST THE
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL FACTS BUT THEY ARE FREQUENTLY UNCERTAIN AND WE
ONLY LEARN THE TRUE LESSON WHICH IS TO BE GATHERED FROM THEM WHEN WE
PLACE OURSELVES ABOVE THEM
THESE REFLECTIONS TEND TO SHOW THAT THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLATO AND OURSELVES THOUGH NOT UNIMPORTANT IS NOT
SO GREAT AS MIGHT AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR
FOR WE SHOULD AGREE WITH HIM
IN PLACING THE MORAL BEFORE THE HISTORICAL TRUTH OF RELIGION AND
GENERALLY IN DISREGARDING THOSE ERRORS OR MISSTATEMENTS OF FACT WHICH
NECESSARILY OCCUR IN THE EARLY STAGES OF ALL RELIGIONS
WE KNOW ALSO
THAT CHANGES IN THE TRADITIONS OF A COUNTRY CANNOT BE MADE IN A DAY AND
ARE THEREFORE TOLERANT OF MANY THINGS WHICH SCIENCE AND CRITICISM WOULD
CONDEMN
WE NOTE IN PASSING THAT THE ALLEGORICAL INTERPRETATION OF MYTHOLOGY
SAID TO HAVE BEEN FIRST INTRODUCED AS EARLY AS THE SIXTH CENTURY BEFORE
CHRIST BY THEAGENES OF RHEGIUM WAS WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE AGE OF
PLATO AND HERE AS IN THE PHAEDRUS THOUGH FOR A DIFFERENT REASON WAS
REJECTED BY HIM
THAT ANACHRONISMS WHETHER OF RELIGION OR LAW WHEN
MEN HAVE REACHED ANOTHER STAGE OF CIVILIZATION SHOULD BE GOT RID OF BY
FICTIONS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE
GREAT IS THE ART OF
INTERPRETATION AND BY A NATURAL PROCESS WHICH WHEN ONCE DISCOVERED WAS
ALWAYS GOING ON WHAT COULD NOT BE ALTERED WAS EXPLAINED AWAY
AND SO
WITHOUT ANY PALPABLE INCONSISTENCY THERE EXISTED SIDE BY SIDE TWO FORMS
OF RELIGION THE TRADITION INHERITED OR INVENTED BY THE POETS AND
THE CUSTOMARY WORSHIP OF THE TEMPLE ON THE OTHER HAND THERE WAS THE
RELIGION OF THE PHILOSOPHER WHO WAS DWELLING IN THE HEAVEN OF IDEAS
BUT DID NOT THEREFORE REFUSE TO OFFER A COCK TO AESCULAPIUS OR TO
BE SEEN SAYING HIS PRAYERS AT THE RISING OF THE SUN
AT LENGTH THE
ANTAGONISM BETWEEN THE POPULAR AND PHILOSOPHICAL RELIGION NEVER SO
GREAT AMONG THE GREEKS AS IN OUR OWN AGE DISAPPEARED AND WAS ONLY FELT
LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RELIGION OF THE EDUCATED AND UNEDUCATED
AMONG OURSELVES
THE ZEUS OF HOMER AND HESIOD EASILY PASSED INTO
THE 'ROYAL MIND' OF PLATO PHILEBUS THE GIANT HERACLES BECAME THE
KNIGHT ERRANT AND BENEFACTOR OF MANKIND
THESE AND STILL MORE WONDERFUL
TRANSFORMATIONS WERE READILY EFFECTED BY THE INGENUITY OF STOICS AND
NEO PLATONISTS IN THE TWO OR THREE CENTURIES BEFORE AND AFTER CHRIST
THE GREEK AND ROMAN RELIGIONS WERE GRADUALLY PERMEATED BY THE SPIRIT OF
PHILOSOPHY HAVING LOST THEIR ANCIENT MEANING THEY WERE RESOLVED INTO
POETRY AND MORALITY AND PROBABLY WERE NEVER PURER THAN AT THE TIME OF
THEIR DECAY WHEN THEIR INFLUENCE OVER THE WORLD WAS WANING
A SINGULAR CONCEPTION WHICH OCCURS TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOOK IS
THE LIE IN THE SOUL THIS IS CONNECTED WITH THE PLATONIC AND SOCRATIC
DOCTRINE THAT INVOLUNTARY IGNORANCE IS WORSE THAN VOLUNTARY
THE LIE
IN THE SOUL IS A TRUE LIE THE CORRUPTION OF THE HIGHEST TRUTH THE
DECEPTION OF THE HIGHEST PART OF THE SOUL FROM WHICH HE WHO IS DECEIVED
HAS NO POWER OF DELIVERING HIMSELF
FOR EXAMPLE TO REPRESENT GOD
AS FALSE OR IMMORAL OR ACCORDING TO PLATO AS DELUDING MEN WITH
APPEARANCES OR AS THE AUTHOR OF EVIL OR AGAIN TO AFFIRM WITH
PROTAGORAS THAT 'KNOWLEDGE IS SENSATION OR THAT 'BEING IS BECOMING
OR WITH THRASYMACHUS 'THAT MIGHT IS RIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN REGARDED BY
PLATO AS A LIE OF THIS HATEFUL SORT
THE GREATEST UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF THE
GREATEST UNTRUTH E G
IF IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE GOSPELS JOHN 'HE
WHO WAS BLIND' WERE TO SAY 'I SEE IS ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE STATE
OF MIND WHICH PLATO IS DESCRIBING
THE LIE IN THE SOUL MAY BE FURTHER
COMPARED WITH THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST LUKE ALLOWING FOR THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GREEK AND CHRISTIAN MODES OF SPEAKING
TO THIS IS
OPPOSED THE LIE IN WORDS WHICH IS ONLY SUCH A DECEPTION AS MAY OCCUR
IN A PLAY OR POEM OR ALLEGORY OR FIGURE OF SPEECH OR IN ANY SORT OF
ACCOMMODATION WHICH THOUGH USELESS TO THE GODS MAY BE USEFUL TO MEN
IN CERTAIN CASES
SOCRATES IS HERE ANSWERING THE QUESTION WHICH HE HAD
HIMSELF RAISED ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF DECEIVING A MADMAN AND HE IS ALSO
CONTRASTING THE NATURE OF GOD AND MAN
FOR GOD IS TRUTH BUT MANKIND CAN
ONLY BE TRUE BY APPEARING SOMETIMES TO BE PARTIAL OR FALSE
RESERVING
FOR ANOTHER PLACE THE GREATER QUESTIONS OF RELIGION OR EDUCATION WE
MAY NOTE FURTHER 1 THE APPROVAL OF THE OLD TRADITIONAL EDUCATION
OF GREECE 2 THE PREPARATION WHICH PLATO IS MAKING FOR THE ATTACK ON
HOMER AND THE POETS 3 THE PREPARATION WHICH HE IS ALSO MAKING FOR THE
USE OF ECONOMIES IN THE STATE 4 THE CONTEMPTUOUS AND AT THE SAME TIME
EUPHEMISTIC MANNER IN WHICH HERE AS BELOW HE ALLUDES TO THE 'CHRONIQUE
SCANDALEUSE' OF THE GODS
BOOK III
THERE IS ANOTHER MOTIVE IN PURIFYING RELIGION WHICH IS TO
BANISH FEAR FOR NO MAN CAN BE COURAGEOUS WHO IS AFRAID OF DEATH OR WHO
BELIEVES THE TALES WHICH ARE REPEATED BY THE POETS CONCERNING THE WORLD
BELOW
THEY MUST BE GENTLY REQUESTED NOT TO ABUSE HELL THEY MAY BE
REMINDED THAT THEIR STORIES ARE BOTH UNTRUE AND DISCOURAGING
NOR MUST
THEY BE ANGRY IF WE EXPUNGE OBNOXIOUS PASSAGES SUCH AS THE DEPRESSING
WORDS OF ACHILLES 'I WOULD RATHER BE A SERVING MAN THAN RULE OVER
ALL THE DEAD AND THE VERSES WHICH TELL OF THE SQUALID MANSIONS THE
SENSELESS SHADOWS THE FLITTING SOUL MOURNING OVER LOST STRENGTH AND
YOUTH THE SOUL WITH A GIBBER GOING BENEATH THE EARTH LIKE SMOKE OR
THE SOULS OF THE SUITORS WHICH FLUTTER ABOUT LIKE BATS
THE TERRORS AND
HORRORS OF COCYTUS AND STYX GHOSTS AND SAPLESS SHADES AND THE REST
OF THEIR TARTAREAN NOMENCLATURE MUST VANISH
SUCH TALES MAY HAVE THEIR
USE BUT THEY ARE NOT THE PROPER FOOD FOR SOLDIERS
AS LITTLE CAN WE
ADMIT THE SORROWS AND SYMPATHIES OF THE HOMERIC HEROES ACHILLES THE
SON OF THETIS IN TEARS THROWING ASHES ON HIS HEAD OR PACING UP AND
DOWN THE SEA SHORE IN DISTRACTION OR PRIAM THE COUSIN OF THE GODS
CRYING ALOUD ROLLING IN THE MIRE
A GOOD MAN IS NOT PROSTRATED AT
THE LOSS OF CHILDREN OR FORTUNE
NEITHER IS DEATH TERRIBLE TO HIM AND
THEREFORE LAMENTATIONS OVER THE DEAD SHOULD NOT BE PRACTISED BY MEN OF
NOTE THEY SHOULD BE THE CONCERN OF INFERIOR PERSONS ONLY WHETHER WOMEN
OR MEN
STILL WORSE IS THE ATTRIBUTION OF SUCH WEAKNESS TO THE GODS AS
WHEN THE GODDESSES SAY 'ALAS MY TRAVAIL AND WORST OF ALL WHEN THE
KING OF HEAVEN HIMSELF LAMENTS HIS INABILITY TO SAVE HECTOR OR SORROWS
OVER THE IMPENDING DOOM OF HIS DEAR SARPEDON
SUCH A CHARACTER OF GOD
IF NOT RIDICULED BY OUR YOUNG MEN IS LIKELY TO BE IMITATED BY THEM
NOR SHOULD OUR CITIZENS BE GIVEN TO EXCESS OF LAUGHTER 'SUCH VIOLENT
DELIGHTS' ARE FOLLOWED BY A VIOLENT RE ACTION
THE DESCRIPTION IN THE
ILIAD OF THE GODS SHAKING THEIR SIDES AT THE CLUMSINESS OF HEPHAESTUS
WILL NOT BE ADMITTED BY US
'CERTAINLY NOT
TRUTH SHOULD HAVE A HIGH PLACE AMONG THE VIRTUES FOR FALSEHOOD AS
WE WERE SAYING IS USELESS TO THE GODS AND ONLY USEFUL TO MEN AS A
MEDICINE
BUT THIS EMPLOYMENT OF FALSEHOOD MUST REMAIN A PRIVILEGE OF
STATE THE COMMON MAN MUST NOT IN RETURN TELL A LIE TO THE RULER ANY
MORE THAN THE PATIENT WOULD TELL A LIE TO HIS PHYSICIAN OR THE SAILOR
TO HIS CAPTAIN
IN THE NEXT PLACE OUR YOUTH MUST BE TEMPERATE AND TEMPERANCE CONSISTS
IN SELF CONTROL AND OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY
THAT IS A LESSON WHICH HOMER
TEACHES IN SOME PLACES 'THE ACHAEANS MARCHED ON BREATHING PROWESS IN
SILENT AWE OF THEIR LEADERS BUT A VERY DIFFERENT ONE IN OTHER PLACES
'O HEAVY WITH WINE WHO HAST THE EYES OF A DOG BUT THE HEART OF A
STAG LANGUAGE OF THE LATTER KIND WILL NOT IMPRESS SELF CONTROL ON THE
MINDS OF YOUTH
THE SAME MAY BE SAID ABOUT HIS PRAISES OF EATING AND
DRINKING AND HIS DREAD OF STARVATION ALSO ABOUT THE VERSES IN WHICH HE
TELLS OF THE RAPTUROUS LOVES OF ZEUS AND HERE OR OF HOW HEPHAESTUS ONCE
DETAINED ARES AND APHRODITE IN A NET ON A SIMILAR OCCASION
THERE IS A
NOBLER STRAIN HEARD IN THE WORDS 'ENDURE MY SOUL THOU HAST ENDURED
WORSE NOR MUST WE ALLOW OUR CITIZENS TO RECEIVE BRIBES OR TO SAY
'GIFTS PERSUADE THE GODS GIFTS REVEREND KINGS OR TO APPLAUD THE
IGNOBLE ADVICE OF PHOENIX TO ACHILLES THAT HE SHOULD GET MONEY OUT OF
THE GREEKS BEFORE HE ASSISTED THEM OR THE MEANNESS OF ACHILLES HIMSELF
IN TAKING GIFTS FROM AGAMEMNON OR HIS REQUIRING A RANSOM FOR THE BODY
OF HECTOR OR HIS CURSING OF APOLLO OR HIS INSOLENCE TO THE RIVER GOD
SCAMANDER OR HIS DEDICATION TO THE DEAD PATROCLUS OF HIS OWN HAIR WHICH
HAD BEEN ALREADY DEDICATED TO THE OTHER RIVER GOD SPERCHEIUS OR HIS
CRUELTY IN DRAGGING THE BODY OF HECTOR ROUND THE WALLS AND SLAYING
THE CAPTIVES AT THE PYRE SUCH A COMBINATION OF MEANNESS AND CRUELTY IN
CHEIRON'S PUPIL IS INCONCEIVABLE
THE AMATORY EXPLOITS OF PEIRITHOUS AND
THESEUS ARE EQUALLY UNWORTHY
EITHER THESE SO CALLED SONS OF GODS WERE
NOT THE SONS OF GODS OR THEY WERE NOT SUCH AS THE POETS IMAGINE THEM
ANY MORE THAN THE GODS THEMSELVES ARE THE AUTHORS OF EVIL
THE YOUTH WHO
BELIEVES THAT SUCH THINGS ARE DONE BY THOSE WHO HAVE THE BLOOD OF HEAVEN
FLOWING IN THEIR VEINS WILL BE TOO READY TO IMITATE THEIR EXAMPLE
ENOUGH OF GODS AND HEROES WHAT SHALL WE SAY ABOUT MEN WHAT THE POETS
AND STORY TELLERS SAY THAT THE WICKED PROSPER AND THE RIGHTEOUS ARE
AFFLICTED OR THAT JUSTICE IS ANOTHER'S GAIN SUCH MISREPRESENTATIONS
CANNOT BE ALLOWED BY US
BUT IN THIS WE ARE ANTICIPATING THE DEFINITION
OF JUSTICE AND HAD THEREFORE BETTER DEFER THE ENQUIRY
THE SUBJECTS OF POETRY HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TREATED NEXT FOLLOWS
STYLE
NOW ALL POETRY IS A NARRATIVE OF EVENTS PAST PRESENT OR TO
COME AND NARRATIVE IS OF THREE KINDS THE SIMPLE THE IMITATIVE AND
A COMPOSITION OF THE TWO
AN INSTANCE WILL MAKE MY MEANING CLEAR
THE FIRST SCENE IN HOMER IS OF THE LAST OR MIXED KIND BEING PARTLY
DESCRIPTION AND PARTLY DIALOGUE
BUT IF YOU THROW THE DIALOGUE INTO THE
'ORATIO OBLIQUA THE PASSAGE WILL RUN THUS THE PRIEST CAME AND PRAYED
APOLLO THAT THE ACHAEANS MIGHT TAKE TROY AND HAVE A SAFE RETURN IF
AGAMEMNON WOULD ONLY GIVE HIM BACK HIS DAUGHTER AND THE OTHER GREEKS
ASSENTED BUT AGAMEMNON WAS WROTH AND SO ON THE WHOLE THEN BECOMES
DESCRIPTIVE AND THE POET IS THE ONLY SPEAKER LEFT OR IF YOU OMIT THE
NARRATIVE THE WHOLE BECOMES DIALOGUE
THESE ARE THE THREE STYLES WHICH
OF THEM IS TO BE ADMITTED INTO OUR STATE 'DO YOU ASK WHETHER TRAGEDY
AND COMEDY ARE TO BE ADMITTED YES BUT ALSO SOMETHING MORE IS IT NOT
DOUBTFUL WHETHER OUR GUARDIANS ARE TO BE IMITATORS AT ALL OR RATHER
HAS NOT THE QUESTION BEEN ALREADY ANSWERED FOR WE HAVE DECIDED THAT ONE
MAN CANNOT IN HIS LIFE PLAY MANY PARTS ANY MORE THAN HE CAN ACT BOTH
TRAGEDY AND COMEDY OR BE RHAPSODIST AND ACTOR AT ONCE HUMAN NATURE
IS COINED INTO VERY SMALL PIECES AND AS OUR GUARDIANS HAVE THEIR OWN
BUSINESS ALREADY WHICH IS THE CARE OF FREEDOM THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH
TO DO WITHOUT IMITATING
IF THEY IMITATE THEY SHOULD IMITATE NOT ANY
MEANNESS OR BASENESS BUT THE GOOD ONLY FOR THE MASK WHICH THE ACTOR
WEARS IS APT TO BECOME HIS FACE
WE CANNOT ALLOW MEN TO PLAY THE PARTS
OF WOMEN QUARRELLING WEEPING SCOLDING OR BOASTING AGAINST THE
GODS LEAST OF ALL WHEN MAKING LOVE OR IN LABOUR
THEY MUST NOT
REPRESENT SLAVES OR BULLIES OR COWARDS DRUNKARDS OR MADMEN OR
BLACKSMITHS OR NEIGHING HORSES OR BELLOWING BULLS OR SOUNDING RIVERS
OR A RAGING SEA
A GOOD OR WISE MAN WILL BE WILLING TO PERFORM GOOD AND
WISE ACTIONS BUT HE WILL BE ASHAMED TO PLAY AN INFERIOR PART WHICH HE
HAS NEVER PRACTISED AND HE WILL PREFER TO EMPLOY THE DESCRIPTIVE STYLE
WITH AS LITTLE IMITATION AS POSSIBLE
THE MAN WHO HAS NO SELF RESPECT
ON THE CONTRARY WILL IMITATE ANYBODY AND ANYTHING SOUNDS OF NATURE
AND CRIES OF ANIMALS ALIKE HIS WHOLE PERFORMANCE WILL BE IMITATION OF
GESTURE AND VOICE
NOW IN THE DESCRIPTIVE STYLE THERE ARE FEW CHANGES
BUT IN THE DRAMATIC THERE ARE A GREAT MANY
POETS AND MUSICIANS USE
EITHER OR A COMPOUND OF BOTH AND THIS COMPOUND IS VERY ATTRACTIVE
TO YOUTH AND THEIR TEACHERS AS WELL AS TO THE VULGAR
BUT OUR STATE IN
WHICH ONE MAN PLAYS ONE PART ONLY IS NOT ADAPTED FOR COMPLEXITY
AND
WHEN ONE OF THESE POLYPHONOUS PANTOMIMIC GENTLEMEN OFFERS TO EXHIBIT
HIMSELF AND HIS POETRY WE WILL SHOW HIM EVERY OBSERVANCE OF RESPECT
BUT AT THE SAME TIME TELL HIM THAT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR HIS KIND IN OUR
STATE WE PREFER THE ROUGH HONEST POET AND WILL NOT DEPART FROM OUR
ORIGINAL MODELS LAWS
NEXT AS TO THE MUSIC
A SONG OR ODE HAS THREE PARTS THE SUBJECT THE
HARMONY AND THE RHYTHM OF WHICH THE TWO LAST ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE
FIRST
AS WE BANISHED STRAINS OF LAMENTATION SO WE MAY NOW BANISH THE
MIXED LYDIAN HARMONIES WHICH ARE THE HARMONIES OF LAMENTATION AND
AS OUR CITIZENS ARE TO BE TEMPERATE WE MAY ALSO BANISH CONVIVIAL
HARMONIES SUCH AS THE IONIAN AND PURE LYDIAN
TWO REMAIN THE
DORIAN AND PHRYGIAN THE FIRST FOR WAR THE SECOND FOR PEACE THE
ONE EXPRESSIVE OF COURAGE THE OTHER OF OBEDIENCE OR INSTRUCTION OR
RELIGIOUS FEELING
AND AS WE REJECT VARIETIES OF HARMONY WE SHALL
ALSO REJECT THE MANY STRINGED VARIOUSLY SHAPED INSTRUMENTS WHICH GIVE
UTTERANCE TO THEM AND IN PARTICULAR THE FLUTE WHICH IS MORE COMPLEX
THAN ANY OF THEM
THE LYRE AND THE HARP MAY BE PERMITTED IN THE TOWN
AND THE PAN'S PIPE IN THE FIELDS
THUS WE HAVE MADE A PURGATION OF
MUSIC AND WILL NOW MAKE A PURGATION OF METRES
THESE SHOULD BE LIKE THE
HARMONIES SIMPLE AND SUITABLE TO THE OCCASION
THERE ARE FOUR NOTES
OF THE TETRACHORD AND THERE ARE THREE RATIOS OF METRE 3 2 2 2
2 1 WHICH HAVE ALL THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND THE FEET HAVE DIFFERENT
CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS THE RHYTHMS
BUT ABOUT THIS YOU AND I MUST
ASK DAMON THE GREAT MUSICIAN WHO SPEAKS IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY OF A
MARTIAL MEASURE AS WELL AS OF DACTYLIC TROCHAIC AND IAMBIC RHYTHMS
WHICH HE ARRANGES SO AS TO EQUALIZE THE SYLLABLES WITH ONE ANOTHER
ASSIGNING TO EACH THE PROPER QUANTITY
WE ONLY VENTURE TO AFFIRM THE
GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT THE STYLE IS TO CONFORM TO THE SUBJECT AND THE
METRE TO THE STYLE AND THAT THE SIMPLICITY AND HARMONY OF THE SOUL
SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THEM ALL
THIS PRINCIPLE OF SIMPLICITY HAS TO
BE LEARNT BY EVERY ONE IN THE DAYS OF HIS YOUTH AND MAY BE GATHERED
ANYWHERE FROM THE CREATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE ARTS AS WELL AS FROM THE
FORMS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
OTHER ARTISTS AS WELL AS POETS SHOULD BE WARNED AGAINST MEANNESS OR
UNSEEMLINESS
SCULPTURE AND PAINTING EQUALLY WITH MUSIC MUST CONFORM TO
THE LAW OF SIMPLICITY
HE WHO VIOLATES IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO WORK IN
OUR CITY AND TO CORRUPT THE TASTE OF OUR CITIZENS
FOR OUR GUARDIANS
MUST GROW UP NOT AMID IMAGES OF DEFORMITY WHICH WILL GRADUALLY POISON
AND CORRUPT THEIR SOULS BUT IN A LAND OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY WHERE THEY
WILL DRINK IN FROM EVERY OBJECT SWEET AND HARMONIOUS INFLUENCES
AND OF
ALL THESE INFLUENCES THE GREATEST IS THE EDUCATION GIVEN BY MUSIC
WHICH FINDS A WAY INTO THE INNERMOST SOUL AND IMPARTS TO IT THE SENSE
OF BEAUTY AND OF DEFORMITY
AT FIRST THE EFFECT IS UNCONSCIOUS BUT WHEN
REASON ARRIVES THEN HE WHO HAS BEEN THUS TRAINED WELCOMES HER AS THE
FRIEND WHOM HE ALWAYS KNEW
AS IN LEARNING TO READ FIRST WE ACQUIRE THE
ELEMENTS OR LETTERS SEPARATELY AND AFTERWARDS THEIR COMBINATIONS
AND CANNOT RECOGNIZE REFLECTIONS OF THEM UNTIL WE KNOW THE LETTERS
THEMSELVES IN LIKE MANNER WE MUST FIRST ATTAIN THE ELEMENTS OR
ESSENTIAL FORMS OF THE VIRTUES AND THEN TRACE THEIR COMBINATIONS IN
LIFE AND EXPERIENCE
THERE IS A MUSIC OF THE SOUL WHICH ANSWERS TO THE
HARMONY OF THE WORLD AND THE FAIREST OBJECT OF A MUSICAL SOUL IS THE
FAIR MIND IN THE FAIR BODY
SOME DEFECT IN THE LATTER MAY BE EXCUSED
BUT NOT IN THE FORMER
TRUE LOVE IS THE DAUGHTER OF TEMPERANCE AND
TEMPERANCE IS UTTERLY OPPOSED TO THE MADNESS OF BODILY PLEASURE
ENOUGH
HAS BEEN SAID OF MUSIC WHICH MAKES A FAIR ENDING WITH LOVE
NEXT WE PASS ON TO GYMNASTICS ABOUT WHICH I WOULD REMARK THAT THE
SOUL IS RELATED TO THE BODY AS A CAUSE TO AN EFFECT AND THEREFORE IF WE
EDUCATE THE MIND WE MAY LEAVE THE EDUCATION OF THE BODY IN HER CHARGE
AND NEED ONLY GIVE A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE COURSE TO BE PURSUED
IN
THE FIRST PLACE THE GUARDIANS MUST ABSTAIN FROM STRONG DRINK FOR THEY
SHOULD BE THE LAST PERSONS TO LOSE THEIR WITS
WHETHER THE HABITS OF
THE PALAESTRA ARE SUITABLE TO THEM IS MORE DOUBTFUL FOR THE ORDINARY
GYMNASTIC IS A SLEEPY SORT OF THING AND IF LEFT OFF SUDDENLY IS APT TO
ENDANGER HEALTH
BUT OUR WARRIOR ATHLETES MUST BE WIDE AWAKE DOGS AND
MUST ALSO BE INURED TO ALL CHANGES OF FOOD AND CLIMATE
HENCE THEY WILL
REQUIRE A SIMPLER KIND OF GYMNASTIC AKIN TO THEIR SIMPLE MUSIC AND FOR
THEIR DIET A RULE MAY BE FOUND IN HOMER WHO FEEDS HIS HEROES ON ROAST
MEAT ONLY AND GIVES THEM NO FISH ALTHOUGH THEY ARE LIVING AT THE
SEA SIDE NOR BOILED MEATS WHICH INVOLVE AN APPARATUS OF POTS AND PANS
AND IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN HE NOWHERE MENTIONS SWEET SAUCES
SICILIAN
COOKERY AND ATTIC CONFECTIONS AND CORINTHIAN COURTEZANS WHICH ARE
TO GYMNASTIC WHAT LYDIAN AND IONIAN MELODIES ARE TO MUSIC MUST BE
FORBIDDEN
WHERE GLUTTONY AND INTEMPERANCE PREVAIL THE TOWN QUICKLY
FILLS WITH DOCTORS AND PLEADERS AND LAW AND MEDICINE GIVE THEMSELVES
AIRS AS SOON AS THE FREEMEN OF A STATE TAKE AN INTEREST IN THEM
BUT
WHAT CAN SHOW A MORE DISGRACEFUL STATE OF EDUCATION THAN TO HAVE TO GO
ABROAD FOR JUSTICE BECAUSE YOU HAVE NONE OF YOUR OWN AT HOME AND YET
THERE IS A WORSE STAGE OF THE SAME DISEASE WHEN MEN HAVE LEARNED
TO TAKE A PLEASURE AND PRIDE IN THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF THE LAW NOT
CONSIDERING HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE FOR THEM SO TO ORDER THEIR LIVES
AS TO HAVE NO NEED OF A NODDING JUSTICE
AND THERE IS A LIKE DISGRACE IN
EMPLOYING A PHYSICIAN NOT FOR THE CURE OF WOUNDS OR EPIDEMIC DISORDERS
BUT BECAUSE A MAN HAS BY LAZINESS AND LUXURY CONTRACTED DISEASES
WHICH WERE UNKNOWN IN THE DAYS OF ASCLEPIUS
HOW SIMPLE IS THE HOMERIC
PRACTICE OF MEDICINE
EURYPYLUS AFTER HE HAS BEEN WOUNDED DRINKS A
POSSET OF PRAMNIAN WINE WHICH IS OF A HEATING NATURE AND YET THE
SONS OF ASCLEPIUS BLAME NEITHER THE DAMSEL WHO GIVES HIM THE DRINK NOR
PATROCLUS WHO IS ATTENDING ON HIM
THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS MODERN SYSTEM
OF NURSING DISEASES WAS INTRODUCED BY HERODICUS THE TRAINER WHO
BEING OF A SICKLY CONSTITUTION BY A COMPOUND OF TRAINING AND MEDICINE
TORTURED FIRST HIMSELF AND THEN A GOOD MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND LIVED
A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN HE HAD ANY RIGHT
BUT ASCLEPIUS WOULD NOT
PRACTISE THIS ART BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THE CITIZENS OF A WELL ORDERED
STATE HAVE NO LEISURE TO BE ILL AND THEREFORE HE ADOPTED THE 'KILL
OR CURE' METHOD WHICH ARTISANS AND LABOURERS EMPLOY
'THEY MUST BE
AT THEIR BUSINESS THEY SAY 'AND HAVE NO TIME FOR CODDLING IF THEY
RECOVER WELL IF THEY DON'T THERE IS AN END OF THEM WHEREAS THE RICH
MAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GENTLEMAN WHO CAN AFFORD TO BE ILL
DO YOU KNOW
A MAXIM OF PHOCYLIDES THAT 'WHEN A MAN BEGINS TO BE RICH' OR PERHAPS
A LITTLE SOONER 'HE SHOULD PRACTISE VIRTUE' BUT HOW CAN EXCESSIVE
CARE OF HEALTH BE INCONSISTENT WITH AN ORDINARY OCCUPATION AND YET
CONSISTENT WITH THAT PRACTICE OF VIRTUE WHICH PHOCYLIDES INCULCATES
WHEN A STUDENT IMAGINES THAT PHILOSOPHY GIVES HIM A HEADACHE HE NEVER
DOES ANYTHING HE IS ALWAYS UNWELL
THIS WAS THE REASON WHY ASCLEPIUS
AND HIS SONS PRACTISED NO SUCH ART
THEY WERE ACTING IN THE INTEREST OF
THE PUBLIC AND DID NOT WISH TO PRESERVE USELESS LIVES OR RAISE UP A
PUNY OFFSPRING TO WRETCHED SIRES
HONEST DISEASES THEY HONESTLY CURED
AND IF A MAN WAS WOUNDED THEY APPLIED THE PROPER REMEDIES AND THEN LET
HIM EAT AND DRINK WHAT HE LIKED
BUT THEY DECLINED TO TREAT INTEMPERATE
AND WORTHLESS SUBJECTS EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE MADE LARGE FORTUNES
OUT OF THEM
AS TO THE STORY OF PINDAR THAT ASCLEPIUS WAS SLAIN BY A
THUNDERBOLT FOR RESTORING A RICH MAN TO LIFE THAT IS A LIE FOLLOWING
OUR OLD RULE WE MUST SAY EITHER THAT HE DID NOT TAKE BRIBES OR THAT HE
WAS NOT THE SON OF A GOD
GLAUCON THEN ASKS SOCRATES WHETHER THE BEST PHYSICIANS AND THE BEST
JUDGES WILL NOT BE THOSE WHO HAVE HAD SEVERALLY THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE
OF DISEASES AND OF CRIMES
SOCRATES DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO
PROFESSIONS
THE PHYSICIAN SHOULD HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE OF DISEASE IN
HIS OWN BODY FOR HE CURES WITH HIS MIND AND NOT WITH HIS BODY
BUT
THE JUDGE CONTROLS MIND BY MIND AND THEREFORE HIS MIND SHOULD NOT BE
CORRUPTED BY CRIME
WHERE THEN IS HE TO GAIN EXPERIENCE HOW IS HE TO BE
WISE AND ALSO INNOCENT WHEN YOUNG A GOOD MAN IS APT TO BE DECEIVED BY
EVIL DOERS BECAUSE HE HAS NO PATTERN OF EVIL IN HIMSELF AND THEREFORE
THE JUDGE SHOULD BE OF A CERTAIN AGE HIS YOUTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN
INNOCENT AND HE SHOULD HAVE ACQUIRED INSIGHT INTO EVIL NOT BY THE
PRACTICE OF IT BUT BY THE OBSERVATION OF IT IN OTHERS
THIS IS
THE IDEAL OF A JUDGE THE CRIMINAL TURNED DETECTIVE IS WONDERFULLY
SUSPICIOUS BUT WHEN IN COMPANY WITH GOOD MEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE HE IS
AT FAULT FOR HE FOOLISHLY IMAGINES THAT EVERY ONE IS AS BAD AS HIMSELF
VICE MAY BE KNOWN OF VIRTUE BUT CANNOT KNOW VIRTUE
THIS IS THE SORT OF
MEDICINE AND THIS THE SORT OF LAW WHICH WILL PREVAIL IN OUR STATE THEY
WILL BE HEALING ARTS TO BETTER NATURES BUT THE EVIL BODY WILL BE LEFT
TO DIE BY THE ONE AND THE EVIL SOUL WILL BE PUT TO DEATH BY THE OTHER
AND THE NEED OF EITHER WILL BE GREATLY DIMINISHED BY GOOD MUSIC WHICH
WILL GIVE HARMONY TO THE SOUL AND GOOD GYMNASTIC WHICH WILL GIVE
HEALTH TO THE BODY
NOT THAT THIS DIVISION OF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC REALLY
CORRESPONDS TO SOUL AND BODY FOR THEY ARE BOTH EQUALLY CONCERNED WITH
THE SOUL WHICH IS TAMED BY THE ONE AND AROUSED AND SUSTAINED BY THE
OTHER
THE TWO TOGETHER SUPPLY OUR GUARDIANS WITH THEIR TWOFOLD NATURE
THE PASSIONATE DISPOSITION WHEN IT HAS TOO MUCH GYMNASTIC IS HARDENED
AND BRUTALIZED THE GENTLE OR PHILOSOPHIC TEMPER WHICH HAS TOO MUCH
MUSIC BECOMES ENERVATED
WHILE A MAN IS ALLOWING MUSIC TO POUR LIKE
WATER THROUGH THE FUNNEL OF HIS EARS THE EDGE OF HIS SOUL GRADUALLY
WEARS AWAY AND THE PASSIONATE OR SPIRITED ELEMENT IS MELTED OUT OF
HIM
TOO LITTLE SPIRIT IS EASILY EXHAUSTED TOO MUCH QUICKLY PASSES INTO
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY
SO AGAIN THE ATHLETE BY FEEDING AND TRAINING HAS
HIS COURAGE DOUBLED BUT HE SOON GROWS STUPID HE IS LIKE A WILD BEAST
READY TO DO EVERYTHING BY BLOWS AND NOTHING BY COUNSEL OR POLICY
THERE
ARE TWO PRINCIPLES IN MAN REASON AND PASSION AND TO THESE NOT TO THE
SOUL AND BODY THE TWO ARTS OF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC CORRESPOND
HE WHO
MINGLES THEM IN HARMONIOUS CONCORD IS THE TRUE MUSICIAN HE SHALL BE
THE PRESIDING GENIUS OF OUR STATE
THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHO ARE TO BE OUR RULERS FIRST THE ELDER MUST
RULE THE YOUNGER AND THE BEST OF THE ELDERS WILL BE THE BEST GUARDIANS
NOW THEY WILL BE THE BEST WHO LOVE THEIR SUBJECTS MOST AND THINK THAT
THEY HAVE A COMMON INTEREST WITH THEM IN THE WELFARE OF THE STATE
THESE
WE MUST SELECT BUT THEY MUST BE WATCHED AT EVERY EPOCH OF LIFE TO SEE
WHETHER THEY HAVE RETAINED THE SAME OPINIONS AND HELD OUT AGAINST FORCE
AND ENCHANTMENT
FOR TIME AND PERSUASION AND THE LOVE OF PLEASURE MAY
ENCHANT A MAN INTO A CHANGE OF PURPOSE AND THE FORCE OF GRIEF AND PAIN
MAY COMPEL HIM
AND THEREFORE OUR GUARDIANS MUST BE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN
TRIED BY MANY TESTS LIKE GOLD IN THE REFINER'S FIRE AND HAVE BEEN
PASSED FIRST THROUGH DANGER THEN THROUGH PLEASURE AND AT EVERY AGE
HAVE COME OUT OF SUCH TRIALS VICTORIOUS AND WITHOUT STAIN IN FULL
COMMAND OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR PRINCIPLES HAVING ALL THEIR FACULTIES
IN HARMONIOUS EXERCISE FOR THEIR COUNTRY'S GOOD
THESE SHALL RECEIVE THE
HIGHEST HONOURS BOTH IN LIFE AND DEATH
IT WOULD PERHAPS BE BETTER TO
CONFINE THE TERM 'GUARDIANS' TO THIS SELECT CLASS THE YOUNGER MEN MAY
BE CALLED 'AUXILIARIES
AND NOW FOR ONE MAGNIFICENT LIE IN THE BELIEF OF WHICH OH THAT WE
COULD TRAIN OUR RULERS AT ANY RATE LET US MAKE THE ATTEMPT WITH THE
REST OF THE WORLD
WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL IS ONLY ANOTHER VERSION OF
THE LEGEND OF CADMUS BUT OUR UNBELIEVING GENERATION WILL BE SLOW TO
ACCEPT SUCH A STORY
THE TALE MUST BE IMPARTED FIRST TO THE RULERS
THEN TO THE SOLDIERS LASTLY TO THE PEOPLE
WE WILL INFORM THEM THAT
THEIR YOUTH WAS A DREAM AND THAT DURING THE TIME WHEN THEY SEEMED TO
BE UNDERGOING THEIR EDUCATION THEY WERE REALLY BEING FASHIONED IN THE
EARTH WHO SENT THEM UP WHEN THEY WERE READY AND THAT THEY MUST PROTECT
AND CHERISH HER WHOSE CHILDREN THEY ARE AND REGARD EACH OTHER AS
BROTHERS AND SISTERS
'I DO NOT WONDER AT YOUR BEING ASHAMED TO PROPOUND
SUCH A FICTION THERE IS MORE BEHIND
THESE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
HAVE DIFFERENT NATURES AND SOME OF THEM GOD FRAMED TO RULE WHOM HE
FASHIONED OF GOLD OTHERS HE MADE OF SILVER TO BE AUXILIARIES OTHERS
AGAIN TO BE HUSBANDMEN AND CRAFTSMEN AND THESE WERE FORMED BY HIM OF
BRASS AND IRON
BUT AS THEY ARE ALL SPRUNG FROM A COMMON STOCK A GOLDEN
PARENT MAY HAVE A SILVER SON OR A SILVER PARENT A GOLDEN SON AND THEN
THERE MUST BE A CHANGE OF RANK THE SON OF THE RICH MUST DESCEND AND
THE CHILD OF THE ARTISAN RISE IN THE SOCIAL SCALE FOR AN ORACLE SAYS
'THAT THE STATE WILL COME TO AN END IF GOVERNED BY A MAN OF BRASS OR
IRON WILL OUR CITIZENS EVER BELIEVE ALL THIS 'NOT IN THE PRESENT
GENERATION BUT IN THE NEXT PERHAPS YES
NOW LET THE EARTHBORN MEN GO FORTH UNDER THE COMMAND OF THEIR RULERS
AND LOOK ABOUT AND PITCH THEIR CAMP IN A HIGH PLACE WHICH WILL BE SAFE
AGAINST ENEMIES FROM WITHOUT AND LIKEWISE AGAINST INSURRECTIONS FROM
WITHIN
THERE LET THEM SACRIFICE AND SET UP THEIR TENTS FOR SOLDIERS
THEY ARE TO BE AND NOT SHOPKEEPERS THE WATCHDOGS AND GUARDIANS OF THE
SHEEP AND LUXURY AND AVARICE WILL TURN THEM INTO WOLVES AND TYRANTS
THEIR HABITS AND THEIR DWELLINGS SHOULD CORRESPOND TO THEIR EDUCATION
THEY SHOULD HAVE NO PROPERTY THEIR PAY SHOULD ONLY MEET THEIR EXPENSES
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE COMMON MEALS
GOLD AND SILVER WE WILL TELL THEM
THAT THEY HAVE FROM GOD AND THIS DIVINE GIFT IN THEIR SOULS THEY MUST
NOT ALLOY WITH THAT EARTHLY DROSS WHICH PASSES UNDER THE NAME OF GOLD
THEY ONLY OF THE CITIZENS MAY NOT TOUCH IT OR BE UNDER THE SAME ROOF
WITH IT OR DRINK FROM IT IT IS THE ACCURSED THING
SHOULD THEY
EVER ACQUIRE HOUSES OR LANDS OR MONEY OF THEIR OWN THEY WILL BECOME
HOUSEHOLDERS AND TRADESMEN INSTEAD OF GUARDIANS ENEMIES AND TYRANTS
INSTEAD OF HELPERS AND THE HOUR OF RUIN BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THE
REST OF THE STATE WILL BE AT HAND
THE RELIGIOUS AND ETHICAL ASPECT OF PLATO'S EDUCATION WILL HEREAFTER
BE CONSIDERED UNDER A SEPARATE HEAD
SOME LESSER POINTS MAY BE MORE
CONVENIENTLY NOTICED IN THIS PLACE
1
THE CONSTANT APPEAL TO THE AUTHORITY OF HOMER WHOM WITH GRAVE
IRONY PLATO AFTER THE MANNER OF HIS AGE SUMMONS AS A WITNESS ABOUT
ETHICS AND PSYCHOLOGY AS WELL AS ABOUT DIET AND MEDICINE ATTEMPTING
TO DISTINGUISH THE BETTER LESSON FROM THE WORSE SOMETIMES ALTERING
THE TEXT FROM DESIGN MORE THAN ONCE QUOTING OR ALLUDING TO HOMER
INACCURATELY AFTER THE MANNER OF THE EARLY LOGOGRAPHERS TURNING THE
ILIAD INTO PROSE AND DELIGHTING TO DRAW FAR FETCHED INFERENCES FROM
HIS WORDS OR TO MAKE LUDICROUS APPLICATIONS OF THEM
HE DOES NOT LIKE
HERACLEITUS GET INTO A RAGE WITH HOMER AND ARCHILOCHUS HERACL BUT
USES THEIR WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS AS VEHICLES OF A HIGHER TRUTH NOT ON
A SYSTEM LIKE THEAGENES OF RHEGIUM OR METRODORUS OR IN LATER TIMES THE
STOICS BUT AS FANCY MAY DICTATE
AND THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THEM
ARE SOUND ALTHOUGH THE PREMISES ARE FICTITIOUS
THESE FANCIFUL APPEALS
TO HOMER ADD A CHARM TO PLATO'S STYLE AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE
THE EFFECT OF A SATIRE ON THE FOLLIES OF HOMERIC INTERPRETATION
TO US
AND PROBABLY TO HIMSELF ALTHOUGH THEY TAKE THE FORM OF ARGUMENTS
THEY ARE REALLY FIGURES OF SPEECH
THEY MAY BE COMPARED WITH MODERN
CITATIONS FROM SCRIPTURE WHICH HAVE OFTEN A GREAT RHETORICAL POWER EVEN
WHEN THE ORIGINAL MEANING OF THE WORDS IS ENTIRELY LOST SIGHT OF
THE
REAL LIKE THE PLATONIC SOCRATES AS WE GATHER FROM THE MEMORABILIA OF
XENOPHON WAS FOND OF MAKING SIMILAR ADAPTATIONS
GREAT IN ALL AGES AND
COUNTRIES IN RELIGION AS WELL AS IN LAW AND LITERATURE HAS BEEN THE
ART OF INTERPRETATION
2
'THE STYLE IS TO CONFORM TO THE SUBJECT AND THE METRE TO THE STYLE
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FASCINATION WHICH THE WORD 'CLASSICAL' EXERCISES
OVER US WE CAN HARDLY MAINTAIN THAT THIS RULE IS OBSERVED IN ALL THE
GREEK POETRY WHICH HAS COME DOWN TO US
WE CANNOT DENY THAT THE THOUGHT
OFTEN EXCEEDS THE POWER OF LUCID EXPRESSION IN AESCHYLUS AND PINDAR
OR THAT RHETORIC GETS THE BETTER OF THE THOUGHT IN THE SOPHIST POET
EURIPIDES
ONLY PERHAPS IN SOPHOCLES IS THERE A PERFECT HARMONY OF THE
TWO IN HIM ALONE DO WE FIND A GRACE OF LANGUAGE LIKE THE BEAUTY OF A
GREEK STATUE IN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ADD OR TO TAKE AWAY AT
LEAST THIS IS TRUE OF SINGLE PLAYS OR OF LARGE PORTIONS OF THEM
THE
CONNECTION IN THE TRAGIC CHORUSES AND IN THE GREEK LYRIC POETS IS NOT
UNFREQUENTLY A TANGLED THREAD WHICH IN AN AGE BEFORE LOGIC THE POET WAS
UNABLE TO DRAW OUT
MANY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS MINGLED IN HIS MIND AND
HE HAD NO POWER OF DISENGAGING OR ARRANGING THEM
FOR THERE IS A SUBTLE
INFLUENCE OF LOGIC WHICH REQUIRES TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM PROSE TO
POETRY JUST AS THE MUSIC AND PERFECTION OF LANGUAGE ARE INFUSED BY
POETRY INTO PROSE
IN ALL AGES THE POET HAS BEEN A BAD JUDGE OF HIS
OWN MEANING APOL FOR HE DOES NOT SEE THAT THE WORD WHICH IS FULL
OF ASSOCIATIONS TO HIS OWN MIND IS DIFFICULT AND UNMEANING TO THAT OF
ANOTHER OR THAT THE SEQUENCE WHICH IS CLEAR TO HIMSELF IS PUZZLING TO
OTHERS
THERE ARE MANY PASSAGES IN SOME OF OUR GREATEST MODERN POETS
WHICH ARE FAR TOO OBSCURE IN WHICH THERE IS NO PROPORTION BETWEEN STYLE
AND SUBJECT IN WHICH ANY HALF EXPRESSED FIGURE ANY HARSH CONSTRUCTION
ANY DISTORTED COLLOCATION OF WORDS ANY REMOTE SEQUENCE OF IDEAS IS
ADMITTED AND THERE IS NO VOICE 'COMING SWEETLY FROM NATURE OR MUSIC
ADDING THE EXPRESSION OF FEELING TO THOUGHT
AS IF THERE COULD BE POETRY
WITHOUT BEAUTY OR BEAUTY WITHOUT EASE AND CLEARNESS
THE OBSCURITIES
OF EARLY GREEK POETS AROSE NECESSARILY OUT OF THE STATE OF LANGUAGE AND
LOGIC WHICH EXISTED IN THEIR AGE
THEY ARE NOT EXAMPLES TO BE FOLLOWED
BY US FOR THE USE OF LANGUAGE OUGHT IN EVERY GENERATION TO BECOME
CLEARER AND CLEARER
LIKE SHAKESPERE THEY WERE GREAT IN SPITE NOT
IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR IMPERFECTIONS OF EXPRESSION
BUT THERE IS NO
REASON FOR RETURNING TO THE NECESSARY OBSCURITY WHICH PREVAILED IN
THE INFANCY OF LITERATURE
THE ENGLISH POETS OF THE LAST CENTURY WERE
CERTAINLY NOT OBSCURE AND WE HAVE NO EXCUSE FOR LOSING WHAT THEY HAD
GAINED OR FOR GOING BACK TO THE EARLIER OR TRANSITIONAL AGE WHICH
PRECEDED THEM
THE THOUGHT OF OUR OWN TIMES HAS NOT OUT STRIPPED
LANGUAGE A WANT OF PLATO'S 'ART OF MEASURING' IS THE RULE CAUSE OF THE
DISPROPORTION BETWEEN THEM
3
IN THE THIRD BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC A NEARER APPROACH IS MADE TO A
THEORY OF ART THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN PLATO
HIS VIEWS MAY BE SUMMED UP
AS FOLLOWS TRUE ART IS NOT FANCIFUL AND IMITATIVE BUT SIMPLE AND
IDEAL THE EXPRESSION OF THE HIGHEST MORAL ENERGY WHETHER IN ACTION OR
REPOSE
TO LIVE AMONG WORKS OF PLASTIC ART WHICH ARE OF THIS NOBLE
AND SIMPLE CHARACTER OR TO LISTEN TO SUCH STRAINS IS THE BEST OF
INFLUENCES THE TRUE GREEK ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH YOUTH SHOULD BE BROUGHT
UP
THAT IS THE WAY TO CREATE IN THEM A NATURAL GOOD TASTE WHICH WILL
HAVE A FEELING OF TRUTH AND BEAUTY IN ALL THINGS
FOR THOUGH THE
POETS ARE TO BE EXPELLED STILL ART IS RECOGNIZED AS ANOTHER ASPECT OF
REASON LIKE LOVE IN THE SYMPOSIUM EXTENDING OVER THE SAME SPHERE BUT
CONFINED TO THE PRELIMINARY EDUCATION AND ACTING THROUGH THE POWER OF
HABIT AND THIS CONCEPTION OF ART IS NOT LIMITED TO STRAINS OF MUSIC OR
THE FORMS OF PLASTIC ART BUT PERVADES ALL NATURE AND HAS A WIDE KINDRED
IN THE WORLD
THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO LIKE THE ATHENS OF PERICLES HAS AN
ARTISTIC AS WELL AS A POLITICAL SIDE
THERE IS HARDLY ANY MENTION IN PLATO OF THE CREATIVE ARTS ONLY IN TWO
OR THREE PASSAGES DOES HE EVEN ALLUDE TO THEM REP SOPH
HE IS
NOT LOST IN RAPTURE AT THE GREAT WORKS OF PHIDIAS THE PARTHENON THE
PROPYLEA THE STATUES OF ZEUS OR ATHENE
HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE REGARDED
ANY ABSTRACT TRUTH OF NUMBER OR FIGURE AS HIGHER THAN THE GREATEST OF
THEM
YET IT IS HARD TO SUPPOSE THAT SOME INFLUENCE SUCH AS HE HOPES TO
INSPIRE IN YOUTH DID NOT PASS INTO HIS OWN MIND FROM THE WORKS OF ART
WHICH HE SAW AROUND HIM
WE ARE LIVING UPON THE FRAGMENTS OF THEM AND
FIND IN A FEW BROKEN STONES THE STANDARD OF TRUTH AND BEAUTY
BUT IN
PLATO THIS FEELING HAS NO EXPRESSION HE NOWHERE SAYS THAT BEAUTY IS THE
OBJECT OF ART HE SEEMS TO DENY THAT WISDOM CAN TAKE AN EXTERNAL FORM
PHAEDRUS HE DOES NOT DISTINGUISH THE FINE FROM THE MECHANICAL ARTS
WHETHER OR NO LIKE SOME WRITERS HE FELT MORE THAN HE EXPRESSED IT
IS AT ANY RATE REMARKABLE THAT THE GREATEST PERFECTION OF THE FINE ARTS
SHOULD COINCIDE WITH AN ALMOST ENTIRE SILENCE ABOUT THEM
IN ONE VERY
STRIKING PASSAGE HE TELLS US THAT A WORK OF ART LIKE THE STATE IS A
WHOLE AND THIS CONCEPTION OF A WHOLE AND THE LOVE OF THE NEWLY BORN
MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES MAY BE REGARDED IF NOT AS THE INSPIRING AT ANY
RATE AS THE REGULATING PRINCIPLES OF GREEK ART XEN
MEM AND SOPHIST
4
PLATO MAKES THE TRUE AND SUBTLE REMARK THAT THE PHYSICIAN HAD BETTER
NOT BE IN ROBUST HEALTH AND SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT ILLNESS IS IN HIS
OWN PERSON
BUT THE JUDGE OUGHT TO HAVE HAD NO SIMILAR EXPERIENCE OF
EVIL HE IS TO BE A GOOD MAN WHO HAVING PASSED HIS YOUTH IN INNOCENCE
BECAME ACQUAINTED LATE IN LIFE WITH THE VICES OF OTHERS
AND THEREFORE
ACCORDING TO PLATO A JUDGE SHOULD NOT BE YOUNG JUST AS A YOUNG MAN
ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE IS NOT FIT TO BE A HEARER OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY
THE BAD ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF VICE BUT NO KNOWLEDGE
OF VIRTUE
IT MAY BE DOUBTED HOWEVER WHETHER THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTION
IS WELL FOUNDED
IN A REMARKABLE PASSAGE OF THE LAWS IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT THE EVIL MAY FORM A CORRECT ESTIMATE OF THE GOOD
THE UNION OF
GENTLENESS AND COURAGE IN BOOK II
AT FIRST SEEMED TO BE A PARADOX
YET WAS AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED TO BE A TRUTH
AND PLATO MIGHT ALSO HAVE
FOUND THAT THE INTUITION OF EVIL MAY BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ABHORRENCE
OF IT
THERE IS A DIRECTNESS OF AIM IN VIRTUE WHICH GIVES AN INSIGHT
INTO VICE
AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHARACTER IS IN SOME DEGREE A NATURAL
SENSE INDEPENDENT OF ANY SPECIAL EXPERIENCE OF GOOD OR EVIL
5
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE CONCEPTIONS OF PLATO BECAUSE UN GREEK AND
ALSO VERY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING WHICH EXISTED AT ALL IN HIS AGE OF
THE WORLD IS THE TRANSPOSITION OF RANKS
IN THE SPARTAN STATE THERE HAD
BEEN ENFRANCHISEMENT OF HELOTS AND DEGRADATION OF CITIZENS UNDER
SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
AND IN THE ANCIENT GREEK ARISTOCRACIES MERIT
WAS CERTAINLY RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS ON WHICH GOVERNMENT WAS
BASED
THE FOUNDERS OF STATES WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THEIR BENEFACTORS WHO
WERE RAISED BY THEIR GREAT ACTIONS ABOVE THE ORDINARY LEVEL OF HUMANITY
AT A LATER PERIOD THE SERVICES OF WARRIORS AND LEGISLATORS WERE HELD TO
ENTITLE THEM AND THEIR DESCENDANTS TO THE PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENSHIP AND
TO THE FIRST RANK IN THE STATE
AND ALTHOUGH THE EXISTENCE OF AN IDEAL
ARISTOCRACY IS SLENDERLY PROVEN FROM THE REMAINS OF EARLY GREEK HISTORY
AND WE HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN ASCRIBING SUCH A CHARACTER HOWEVER THE IDEA
MAY BE DEFINED TO ANY ACTUAL HELLENIC STATE OR INDEED TO ANY STATE
WHICH HAS EVER EXISTED IN THE WORLD STILL THE RULE OF THE BEST WAS
CERTAINLY THE ASPIRATION OF PHILOSOPHERS WHO PROBABLY ACCOMMODATED A
GOOD DEAL THEIR VIEWS OF PRIMITIVE HISTORY TO THEIR OWN NOTIONS OF GOOD
GOVERNMENT
PLATO FURTHER INSISTS ON APPLYING TO THE GUARDIANS OF HIS
STATE A SERIES OF TESTS BY WHICH ALL THOSE WHO FELL SHORT OF A FIXED
STANDARD WERE EITHER REMOVED FROM THE GOVERNING BODY OR NOT ADMITTED
TO IT AND THIS 'ACADEMIC' DISCIPLINE DID TO A CERTAIN EXTENT PREVAIL IN
GREEK STATES ESPECIALLY IN SPARTA
HE ALSO INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM OF
CASTE WHICH EXISTED IN A GREAT PART OF THE ANCIENT AND IS BY NO MEANS
EXTINCT IN THE MODERN EUROPEAN WORLD SHOULD BE SET ASIDE FROM TIME
TO TIME IN FAVOUR OF MERIT
HE IS AWARE HOW DEEPLY THE GREATER PART OF
MANKIND RESENT ANY INTERFERENCE WITH THE ORDER OF SOCIETY AND THEREFORE
HE PROPOSES HIS NOVEL IDEA IN THE FORM OF WHAT HE HIMSELF CALLS A
'MONSTROUS FICTION COMPARE THE CEREMONY OF PREPARATION FOR THE TWO
'GREAT WAVES' IN BOOK V TWO PRINCIPLES ARE INDICATED BY HIM FIRST
THAT THERE IS A DISTINCTION OF RANKS DEPENDENT ON CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR TO
THE INDIVIDUAL SECOND THAT THIS DISTINCTION IS AND OUGHT TO BE BROKEN
THROUGH BY PERSONAL QUALITIES
HE ADAPTS MYTHOLOGY LIKE THE HOMERIC
POEMS TO THE WANTS OF THE STATE MAKING 'THE PHOENICIAN TALE' THE
VEHICLE OF HIS IDEAS
EVERY GREEK STATE HAD A MYTH RESPECTING ITS OWN
ORIGIN THE PLATONIC REPUBLIC MAY ALSO HAVE A TALE OF EARTHBORN MEN
THE
GRAVITY AND VERISIMILITUDE WITH WHICH THE TALE IS TOLD AND THE ANALOGY
OF GREEK TRADITION ARE A SUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF THE 'MONSTROUS
FALSEHOOD ANCIENT POETRY HAD SPOKEN OF A GOLD AND SILVER AND BRASS AND
IRON AGE SUCCEEDING ONE ANOTHER BUT PLATO SUPPOSES THESE DIFFERENCES
IN THE NATURES OF MEN TO EXIST TOGETHER IN A SINGLE STATE
MYTHOLOGY
SUPPLIES A FIGURE UNDER WHICH THE LESSON MAY BE TAUGHT AS PROTAGORAS
SAYS 'THE MYTH IS MORE INTERESTING' AND ALSO ENABLES PLATO TO TOUCH
LIGHTLY ON NEW PRINCIPLES WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS
IN THIS PASSAGE HE
SHADOWS FORTH A GENERAL TRUTH BUT HE DOES NOT TELL US BY WHAT STEPS THE
TRANSPOSITION OF RANKS IS TO BE EFFECTED
INDEED THROUGHOUT THE REPUBLIC
HE ALLOWS THE LOWER RANKS TO FADE INTO THE DISTANCE
WE DO NOT KNOW
WHETHER THEY ARE TO CARRY ARMS AND WHETHER IN THE FIFTH BOOK THEY ARE
OR ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNISTIC REGULATIONS RESPECTING PROPERTY
AND MARRIAGE
NOR IS THERE ANY USE IN ARGUING STRICTLY EITHER FROM A
FEW CHANCE WORDS OR FROM THE SILENCE OF PLATO OR IN DRAWING INFERENCES
WHICH WERE BEYOND HIS VISION
ARISTOTLE IN HIS CRITICISM ON THE
POSITION OF THE LOWER CLASSES DOES NOT PERCEIVE THAT THE POETICAL
CREATION IS 'LIKE THE AIR INVULNERABLE AND CANNOT BE PENETRATED BY
THE SHAFTS OF HIS LOGIC POL
6
TWO PARADOXES WHICH STRIKE THE MODERN READER AS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
FANCIFUL AND IDEAL AND WHICH SUGGEST TO HIM MANY REFLECTIONS ARE TO
BE FOUND IN THE THIRD BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC FIRST THE GREAT POWER OF
MUSIC SO MUCH BEYOND ANY INFLUENCE WHICH IS EXPERIENCED BY US IN MODERN
TIMES WHEN THE ART OR SCIENCE HAS BEEN FAR MORE DEVELOPED AND HAS
FOUND THE SECRET OF HARMONY AS WELL AS OF MELODY SECONDLY THE
INDEFINITE AND ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTROL WHICH THE SOUL IS SUPPOSED TO
EXERCISE OVER THE BODY
IN THE FIRST WE SUSPECT SOME DEGREE OF EXAGGERATION SUCH AS WE MAY
ALSO OBSERVE AMONG CERTAIN MASTERS OF THE ART NOT UNKNOWN TO US AT THE
PRESENT DAY
WITH THIS NATURAL ENTHUSIASM WHICH IS FELT BY A FEW ONLY
THERE SEEMS TO MINGLE IN PLATO A SORT OF PYTHAGOREAN REVERENCE FOR
NUMBERS AND NUMERICAL PROPORTION TO WHICH ARISTOTLE IS A STRANGER
INTERVALS OF SOUND AND NUMBER ARE TO HIM SACRED THINGS WHICH HAVE A LAW
OF THEIR OWN NOT DEPENDENT ON THE VARIATIONS OF SENSE
THEY RISE ABOVE
SENSE AND BECOME A CONNECTING LINK WITH THE WORLD OF IDEAS
BUT IT IS
EVIDENT THAT PLATO IS DESCRIBING WHAT TO HIM APPEARS TO BE ALSO A FACT
THE POWER OF A SIMPLE AND CHARACTERISTIC MELODY ON THE IMPRESSIBLE
MIND OF THE GREEK IS MORE THAN WE CAN EASILY APPRECIATE
THE EFFECT OF
NATIONAL AIRS MAY BEAR SOME COMPARISON WITH IT
AND BESIDES ALL THIS
THERE IS A CONFUSION BETWEEN THE HARMONY OF MUSICAL NOTES AND THE
HARMONY OF SOUL AND BODY WHICH IS SO POTENTLY INSPIRED BY THEM
THE SECOND PARADOX LEADS UP TO SOME CURIOUS AND INTERESTING
QUESTIONS HOW FAR CAN THE MIND CONTROL THE BODY IS THE RELATION
BETWEEN THEM ONE OF MUTUAL ANTAGONISM OR OF MUTUAL HARMONY ARE THEY
TWO OR ONE AND IS EITHER OF THEM THE CAUSE OF THE OTHER MAY WE NOT AT
TIMES DROP THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN THEM AND THE MODE OF DESCRIBING THEM
WHICH IS SO FAMILIAR TO US AND YET HARDLY CONVEYS ANY PRECISE MEANING
AND TRY TO VIEW THIS COMPOSITE CREATURE MAN IN A MORE SIMPLE MANNER
MUST WE NOT AT ANY RATE ADMIT THAT THERE IS IN HUMAN NATURE A HIGHER
AND A LOWER PRINCIPLE DIVIDED BY NO DISTINCT LINE WHICH AT TIMES
BREAK ASUNDER AND TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OR AGAIN THEY ARE
RECONCILED AND MOVE TOGETHER EITHER UNCONSCIOUSLY IN THE ORDINARY WORK
OF LIFE OR CONSCIOUSLY IN THE PURSUIT OF SOME NOBLE AIM TO BE ATTAINED
NOT WITHOUT AN EFFORT AND FOR WHICH EVERY THOUGHT AND NERVE ARE
STRAINED
AND THEN THE BODY BECOMES THE GOOD FRIEND OR ALLY OR SERVANT
OR INSTRUMENT OF THE MIND
AND THE MIND HAS OFTEN A WONDERFUL AND ALMOST
SUPERHUMAN POWER OF BANISHING DISEASE AND WEAKNESS AND CALLING OUT A
HIDDEN STRENGTH
REASON AND THE DESIRES THE INTELLECT AND THE SENSES
ARE BROUGHT INTO HARMONY AND OBEDIENCE SO AS TO FORM A SINGLE HUMAN
BEING
THEY ARE EVER PARTING EVER MEETING AND THE IDENTITY OR
DIVERSITY OF THEIR TENDENCIES OR OPERATIONS IS FOR THE MOST PART
UNNOTICED BY US
WHEN THE MIND TOUCHES THE BODY THROUGH THE APPETITES
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ONE TO THE OTHER
THERE IS A
TENDENCY IN US WHICH SAYS 'DRINK THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH SAYS 'DO
NOT DRINK IT IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU AND WE ALL OF US KNOW WHICH IS THE
RIGHTFUL SUPERIOR
WE ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HEALTH ALTHOUGH INTO
THIS SPHERE THERE ENTER SOME ELEMENTS OF NECESSITY WHICH MAY BE BEYOND
OUR CONTROL
STILL EVEN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH CARE AND THOUGHT
CONTINUED OVER MANY YEARS MAY MAKE US ALMOST FREE AGENTS IF WE DO
NOT EXACT TOO MUCH OF OURSELVES AND IF WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL HUMAN
FREEDOM IS LIMITED BY THE LAWS OF NATURE AND OF MIND
WE ARE DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT PLATO IN THE GENERAL CONDEMNATION
WHICH HE PASSES ON THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE PREVAILING IN HIS OWN DAY
DEPRECIATES THE EFFECTS OF DIET
HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DISEASES OF A
DEFINITE CHARACTER AND CAPABLE OF RECEIVING A DEFINITE TREATMENT
HE IS
AFRAID OF INVALIDISM INTERFERING WITH THE BUSINESS OF LIFE
HE DOES
NOT RECOGNIZE THAT TIME IS THE GREAT HEALER BOTH OF MENTAL AND BODILY
DISORDERS AND THAT REMEDIES WHICH ARE GRADUAL AND PROCEED LITTLE BY
LITTLE ARE SAFER THAN THOSE WHICH PRODUCE A SUDDEN CATASTROPHE
NEITHER
DOES HE SEE THAT THERE IS NO WAY IN WHICH THE MIND CAN MORE SURELY
INFLUENCE THE BODY THAN BY THE CONTROL OF EATING AND DRINKING OR ANY
OTHER ACTION OR OCCASION OF HUMAN LIFE ON WHICH THE HIGHER FREEDOM OF
THE WILL CAN BE MORE SIMPLE OR TRULY ASSERTED
7
LESSER MATTERS OF STYLE MAY BE REMARKED
1 THE AFFECTED IGNORANCE OF MUSIC WHICH IS PLATO'S WAY OF EXPRESSING
THAT HE IS PASSING LIGHTLY OVER THE SUBJECT
2 THE TENTATIVE MANNER IN WHICH HERE AS IN THE SECOND BOOK HE
PROCEEDS WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATE
3 THE DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE SOMETIMES AS A REALITY AND THEN AGAIN
AS A WORK OF IMAGINATION ONLY THESE ARE THE ARTS BY WHICH HE SUSTAINS
THE READER'S INTEREST
4 CONNECTING LINKS OR THE PREPARATION FOR THE ENTIRE EXPULSION OF THE
POETS IN BOOK X
5 THE COMPANION PICTURES OF THE LOVER OF LITIGATION AND THE
VALETUDINARIAN THE SATIRICAL JEST ABOUT THE MAXIM OF PHOCYLIDES THE
MANNER IN WHICH THE IMAGE OF THE GOLD AND SILVER CITIZENS IS TAKEN
UP INTO THE SUBJECT AND THE ARGUMENT FROM THE PRACTICE OF ASCLEPIUS
SHOULD NOT ESCAPE NOTICE
BOOK IV
ADEIMANTUS SAID 'SUPPOSE A PERSON TO ARGUE SOCRATES THAT YOU
MAKE YOUR CITIZENS MISERABLE AND THIS BY THEIR OWN FREE WILL THEY ARE
THE LORDS OF THE CITY AND YET INSTEAD OF HAVING LIKE OTHER MEN LANDS
AND HOUSES AND MONEY OF THEIR OWN THEY LIVE AS MERCENARIES AND ARE
ALWAYS MOUNTING GUARD YOU MAY ADD I REPLIED THAT THEY RECEIVE NO
PAY BUT ONLY THEIR FOOD AND HAVE NO MONEY TO SPEND ON A JOURNEY OR A
MISTRESS
'WELL AND WHAT ANSWER DO YOU GIVE MY ANSWER IS THAT
OUR GUARDIANS MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE HAPPIEST OF MEN I SHOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED TO FIND IN THE LONG RUN THAT THEY WERE BUT THIS IS NOT THE
AIM OF OUR CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS DESIGNED FOR THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE
AND NOT OF ANY ONE PART
IF I WENT TO A SCULPTOR AND BLAMED HIM FOR
HAVING PAINTED THE EYE WHICH IS THE NOBLEST FEATURE OF THE FACE NOT
PURPLE BUT BLACK HE WOULD REPLY 'THE EYE MUST BE AN EYE AND YOU
SHOULD LOOK AT THE STATUE AS A WHOLE 'NOW I CAN WELL IMAGINE A FOOL'S
PARADISE IN WHICH EVERYBODY IS EATING AND DRINKING CLOTHED IN PURPLE
AND FINE LINEN AND POTTERS LIE ON SOFAS AND HAVE THEIR WHEEL AT HAND
THAT THEY MAY WORK A LITTLE WHEN THEY PLEASE AND COBBLERS AND ALL THE
OTHER CLASSES OF A STATE LOSE THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER
AND A STATE
MAY GET ON WITHOUT COBBLERS BUT WHEN THE GUARDIANS DEGENERATE INTO BOON
COMPANIONS THEN THE RUIN IS COMPLETE
REMEMBER THAT WE ARE NOT TALKING
OF PEASANTS KEEPING HOLIDAY BUT OF A STATE IN WHICH EVERY MAN IS
EXPECTED TO DO HIS OWN WORK
THE HAPPINESS RESIDES NOT IN THIS OR THAT
CLASS BUT IN THE STATE AS A WHOLE
I HAVE ANOTHER REMARK TO MAKE A
MIDDLE CONDITION IS BEST FOR ARTISANS THEY SHOULD HAVE MONEY ENOUGH TO
BUY TOOLS AND NOT ENOUGH TO BE INDEPENDENT OF BUSINESS
AND WILL NOT
THE SAME CONDITION BE BEST FOR OUR CITIZENS IF THEY ARE POOR THEY WILL
BE MEAN IF RICH LUXURIOUS AND LAZY AND IN NEITHER CASE CONTENTED
'BUT THEN HOW WILL OUR POOR CITY BE ABLE TO GO TO WAR AGAINST AN ENEMY
WHO HAS MONEY THERE MAY BE A DIFFICULTY IN FIGHTING AGAINST ONE ENEMY
AGAINST TWO THERE WILL BE NONE
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE CONTEST WILL BE
CARRIED ON BY TRAINED WARRIORS AGAINST WELL TO DO CITIZENS AND IS NOT A
REGULAR ATHLETE AN EASY MATCH FOR TWO STOUT OPPONENTS AT LEAST SUPPOSE
ALSO THAT BEFORE ENGAGING WE SEND AMBASSADORS TO ONE OF THE TWO CITIES
SAYING 'SILVER AND GOLD WE HAVE NOT DO YOU HELP US AND TAKE OUR SHARE
OF THE SPOIL WHO WOULD FIGHT AGAINST THE LEAN WIRY DOGS WHEN THEY
MIGHT JOIN WITH THEM IN PREYING UPON THE FATTED SHEEP 'BUT IF MANY
STATES JOIN THEIR RESOURCES SHALL WE NOT BE IN DANGER I AM AMUSED
TO HEAR YOU USE THE WORD 'STATE' OF ANY BUT OUR OWN STATE
THEY ARE
'STATES BUT NOT 'A STATE' MANY IN ONE
FOR IN EVERY STATE THERE ARE
TWO HOSTILE NATIONS RICH AND POOR WHICH YOU MAY SET ONE AGAINST THE
OTHER
BUT OUR STATE WHILE SHE REMAINS TRUE TO HER PRINCIPLES WILL BE
IN VERY DEED THE MIGHTIEST OF HELLENIC STATES
TO THE SIZE OF THE STATE THERE IS NO LIMIT BUT THE NECESSITY OF UNITY
IT MUST BE NEITHER TOO LARGE NOR TOO SMALL TO BE ONE
THIS IS A MATTER
OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE LIKE THE PRINCIPLE OF TRANSPOSITION WHICH WAS
INTIMATED IN THE PARABLE OF THE EARTHBORN MEN
THE MEANING THERE IMPLIED
WAS THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD DO THAT FOR WHICH HE WAS FITTED AND BE AT
ONE WITH HIMSELF AND THEN THE WHOLE CITY WOULD BE UNITED
BUT ALL THESE
THINGS ARE SECONDARY IF EDUCATION WHICH IS THE GREAT MATTER BE DULY
REGARDED
WHEN THE WHEEL HAS ONCE BEEN SET IN MOTION THE SPEED IS
ALWAYS INCREASING AND EACH GENERATION IMPROVES UPON THE PRECEDING BOTH
IN PHYSICAL AND MORAL QUALITIES
THE CARE OF THE GOVERNORS SHOULD BE
DIRECTED TO PRESERVE MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC FROM INNOVATION ALTER THE
SONGS OF A COUNTRY DAMON SAYS AND YOU WILL SOON END BY ALTERING ITS
LAWS
THE CHANGE APPEARS INNOCENT AT FIRST AND BEGINS IN PLAY BUT
THE EVIL SOON BECOMES SERIOUS WORKING SECRETLY UPON THE CHARACTERS OF
INDIVIDUALS THEN UPON SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS AND LASTLY UPON
THE INSTITUTIONS OF A STATE AND THERE IS RUIN AND CONFUSION EVERYWHERE
BUT IF EDUCATION REMAINS IN THE ESTABLISHED FORM THERE WILL BE NO
DANGER
A RESTORATIVE PROCESS WILL BE ALWAYS GOING ON THE SPIRIT OF LAW
AND ORDER WILL RAISE UP WHAT HAS FALLEN DOWN
NOR WILL ANY REGULATIONS
BE NEEDED FOR THE LESSER MATTERS OF LIFE RULES OF DEPORTMENT OR
FASHIONS OF DRESS
LIKE INVITES LIKE FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL
EDUCATION
WILL CORRECT DEFICIENCIES AND SUPPLY THE POWER OF SELF GOVERNMENT
FAR
BE IT FROM US TO ENTER INTO THE PARTICULARS OF LEGISLATION LET THE
GUARDIANS TAKE CARE OF EDUCATION AND EDUCATION WILL TAKE CARE OF ALL
OTHER THINGS
BUT WITHOUT EDUCATION THEY MAY PATCH AND MEND AS THEY PLEASE THEY WILL
MAKE NO PROGRESS ANY MORE THAN A PATIENT WHO THINKS TO CURE HIMSELF BY
SOME FAVOURITE REMEDY AND WILL NOT GIVE UP HIS LUXURIOUS MODE OF LIVING
IF YOU TELL SUCH PERSONS THAT THEY MUST FIRST ALTER THEIR HABITS THEN
THEY GROW ANGRY THEY ARE CHARMING PEOPLE
'CHARMING NAY THE VERY
REVERSE EVIDENTLY THESE GENTLEMEN ARE NOT IN YOUR GOOD GRACES NOR THE
STATE WHICH IS LIKE THEM
AND SUCH STATES THERE ARE WHICH FIRST ORDAIN
UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH THAT NO ONE SHALL ALTER THE CONSTITUTION AND
THEN SUFFER THEMSELVES TO BE FLATTERED INTO AND OUT OF ANYTHING AND
HE WHO INDULGES THEM AND FAWNS UPON THEM IS THEIR LEADER AND SAVIOUR
'YES THE MEN ARE AS BAD AS THE STATES BUT DO YOU NOT ADMIRE THEIR
CLEVERNESS 'NAY SOME OF THEM ARE STUPID ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WHAT THE
PEOPLE TELL THEM AND WHEN ALL THE WORLD IS TELLING A MAN THAT HE IS
SIX FEET HIGH AND HE HAS NO MEASURE HOW CAN HE BELIEVE ANYTHING
ELSE BUT DON'T GET INTO A PASSION TO SEE OUR STATESMEN TRYING THEIR
NOSTRUMS AND FANCYING THAT THEY CAN CUT OFF AT A BLOW THE HYDRA LIKE
ROGUERIES OF MANKIND IS AS GOOD AS A PLAY
MINUTE ENACTMENTS ARE
SUPERFLUOUS IN GOOD STATES AND ARE USELESS IN BAD ONES
AND NOW WHAT REMAINS OF THE WORK OF LEGISLATION NOTHING FOR US BUT TO
APOLLO THE GOD OF DELPHI WE LEAVE THE ORDERING OF THE GREATEST OF ALL
THINGS THAT IS TO SAY RELIGION
ONLY OUR ANCESTRAL DEITY SITTING UPON
THE CENTRE AND NAVEL OF THE EARTH WILL BE TRUSTED BY US IF WE HAVE ANY
SENSE IN AN AFFAIR OF SUCH MAGNITUDE
NO FOREIGN GOD SHALL BE SUPREME
IN OUR REALMS
HERE AS SOCRATES WOULD SAY LET US 'REFLECT ON' GREEK WHAT HAS
PRECEDED THUS FAR WE HAVE SPOKEN NOT OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE CITIZENS
BUT ONLY OF THE WELL BEING OF THE STATE
THEY MAY BE THE HAPPIEST OF
MEN BUT OUR PRINCIPAL AIM IN FOUNDING THE STATE WAS NOT TO MAKE THEM
HAPPY
THEY WERE TO BE GUARDIANS NOT HOLIDAY MAKERS
IN THIS PLEASANT
MANNER IS PRESENTED TO US THE FAMOUS QUESTION BOTH OF ANCIENT AND MODERN
PHILOSOPHY TOUCHING THE RELATION OF DUTY TO HAPPINESS OF RIGHT TO
UTILITY
FIRST DUTY THEN HAPPINESS IS THE NATURAL ORDER OF OUR MORAL IDEAS
THE
UTILITARIAN PRINCIPLE IS VALUABLE AS A CORRECTIVE OF ERROR AND SHOWS
TO US A SIDE OF ETHICS WHICH IS APT TO BE NEGLECTED
IT MAY BE ADMITTED
FURTHER THAT RIGHT AND UTILITY ARE CO EXTENSIVE AND THAT HE WHO MAKES
THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND HIS OBJECT HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST AND NOBLEST
MOTIVES OF HUMAN ACTION
BUT UTILITY IS NOT THE HISTORICAL BASIS OF
MORALITY NOR THE ASPECT IN WHICH MORAL AND RELIGIOUS IDEAS COMMONLY
OCCUR TO THE MIND
THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF ALL IS AS WE BELIEVE THE
FAR OFF RESULT OF THE DIVINE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE
THE GREATEST
HAPPINESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS CERTAINLY TO BE FOUND IN A LIFE OF VIRTUE
AND GOODNESS
BUT WE SEEM TO BE MORE ASSURED OF A LAW OF RIGHT THAN WE
CAN BE OF A DIVINE PURPOSE THAT 'ALL MANKIND SHOULD BE SAVED AND
WE INFER THE ONE FROM THE OTHER
AND THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF THE
INDIVIDUAL MAY BE THE REVERSE OF THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IN THE ORDINARY
SENSE OF THE TERM AND MAY BE REALISED IN A LIFE OF PAIN OR IN A
VOLUNTARY DEATH
FURTHER THE WORD 'HAPPINESS' HAS SEVERAL AMBIGUITIES
IT MAY MEAN EITHER PLEASURE OR AN IDEAL LIFE HAPPINESS SUBJECTIVE OR
OBJECTIVE IN THIS WORLD OR IN ANOTHER OF OURSELVES ONLY OR OF
OUR NEIGHBOURS AND OF ALL MEN EVERYWHERE
BY THE MODERN FOUNDER OF
UTILITARIANISM THE SELF REGARDING AND DISINTERESTED MOTIVES OF ACTION
ARE INCLUDED UNDER THE SAME TERM ALTHOUGH THEY ARE COMMONLY OPPOSED
BY US AS BENEVOLENCE AND SELF LOVE
THE WORD HAPPINESS HAS NOT THE
DEFINITENESS OR THE SACREDNESS OF 'TRUTH' AND 'RIGHT' IT DOES
NOT EQUALLY APPEAL TO OUR HIGHER NATURE AND HAS NOT SUNK INTO THE
CONSCIENCE OF MANKIND
IT IS ASSOCIATED TOO MUCH WITH THE COMFORTS AND
CONVENIENCES OF LIFE TOO LITTLE WITH 'THE GOODS OF THE SOUL WHICH WE
DESIRE FOR THEIR OWN SAKE IN A GREAT TRIAL OR DANGER OR TEMPTATION
OR IN ANY GREAT AND HEROIC ACTION IT IS SCARCELY THOUGHT OF
FOR THESE
REASONS 'THE GREATEST HAPPINESS' PRINCIPLE IS NOT THE TRUE FOUNDATION OF
ETHICS
BUT THOUGH NOT THE FIRST PRINCIPLE IT IS THE SECOND WHICH IS
LIKE UNTO IT AND IS OFTEN OF EASIER APPLICATION
FOR THE LARGER PART OF
HUMAN ACTIONS ARE NEITHER RIGHT NOR WRONG EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS THEY TEND
TO THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND INTROD
TO GORGIAS AND PHILEBUS
THE SAME QUESTION REAPPEARS IN POLITICS WHERE THE USEFUL OR EXPEDIENT
SEEMS TO CLAIM A LARGER SPHERE AND TO HAVE A GREATER AUTHORITY
FOR
CONCERNING POLITICAL MEASURES WE CHIEFLY ASK HOW WILL THEY AFFECT
THE HAPPINESS OF MANKIND YET HERE TOO WE MAY OBSERVE THAT WHAT WE TERM
EXPEDIENCY IS MERELY THE LAW OF RIGHT LIMITED BY THE CONDITIONS OF HUMAN
SOCIETY
RIGHT AND TRUTH ARE THE HIGHEST AIMS OF GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS
OF INDIVIDUALS AND WE OUGHT NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THEM BECAUSE WE CANNOT
DIRECTLY ENFORCE THEM
THEY APPEAL TO THE BETTER MIND OF NATIONS AND
SOMETIMES THEY ARE TOO MUCH FOR MERELY TEMPORAL INTERESTS TO RESIST
THEY ARE THE WATCHWORDS WHICH ALL MEN USE IN MATTERS OF PUBLIC POLICY
AS WELL AS IN THEIR PRIVATE DEALINGS THE PEACE OF EUROPE MAY BE SAID
TO DEPEND UPON THEM
IN THE MOST COMMERCIAL AND UTILITARIAN STATES
OF SOCIETY THE POWER OF IDEAS REMAINS
AND ALL THE HIGHER CLASS OF
STATESMEN HAVE IN THEM SOMETHING OF THAT IDEALISM WHICH PERICLES IS SAID
TO HAVE GATHERED FROM THE TEACHING OF ANAXAGORAS
THEY RECOGNISE THAT
THE TRUE LEADER OF MEN MUST BE ABOVE THE MOTIVES OF AMBITION AND
THAT NATIONAL CHARACTER IS OF GREATER VALUE THAN MATERIAL COMFORT AND
PROSPERITY
AND THIS IS THE ORDER OF THOUGHT IN PLATO FIRST HE EXPECTS
HIS CITIZENS TO DO THEIR DUTY AND THEN UNDER FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT IS TO SAY IN A WELL ORDERED STATE THEIR HAPPINESS IS ASSURED
THAT HE WAS FAR FROM EXCLUDING THE MODERN PRINCIPLE OF UTILITY IN
POLITICS IS SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENT FROM OTHER PASSAGES IN WHICH 'THE MOST
BENEFICIAL IS AFFIRMED TO BE THE MOST HONOURABLE' AND ALSO 'THE MOST
SACRED'
WE MAY NOTE
1 THE MANNER IN WHICH THE OBJECTION OF ADEIMANTUS HERE IS DESIGNED TO
DRAW OUT AND DEEPEN THE ARGUMENT OF SOCRATES
2 THE CONCEPTION OF A WHOLE AS LYING AT THE FOUNDATION BOTH OF
POLITICS AND OF ART IN THE LATTER SUPPLYING THE ONLY PRINCIPLE OF
CRITICISM WHICH UNDER THE VARIOUS NAMES OF HARMONY SYMMETRY MEASURE
PROPORTION UNITY THE GREEK SEEMS TO HAVE APPLIED TO WORKS OF ART
3 THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE LIMITED IN SIZE AFTER THE
TRADITIONAL MODEL OF A GREEK STATE AS IN THE POLITICS OF ARISTOTLE THE
FACT THAT THE CITIES OF HELLAS WERE SMALL IS CONVERTED INTO A PRINCIPLE
4 THE HUMOROUS PICTURES OF THE LEAN DOGS AND THE FATTED SHEEP OF
THE LIGHT ACTIVE BOXER UPSETTING TWO STOUT GENTLEMEN AT LEAST OF THE
'CHARMING' PATIENTS WHO ARE ALWAYS MAKING THEMSELVES WORSE OR AGAIN
THE PLAYFUL ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS NO STATE BUT OUR OWN OR THE GRAVE
IRONY WITH WHICH THE STATESMAN IS EXCUSED WHO BELIEVES THAT HE IS SIX
FEET HIGH BECAUSE HE IS TOLD SO AND HAVING NOTHING TO MEASURE WITH
IS TO BE PARDONED FOR HIS IGNORANCE HE IS TOO AMUSING FOR US TO BE
SERIOUSLY ANGRY WITH HIM
5 THE LIGHT AND SUPERFICIAL MANNER IN WHICH RELIGION IS PASSED OVER
WHEN PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR TWO GREAT PRINCIPLES FIRST THAT
RELIGION SHALL BE BASED ON THE HIGHEST CONCEPTION OF THE GODS SECONDLY
THAT THE TRUE NATIONAL OR HELLENIC TYPE SHALL BE MAINTAINED
SOCRATES PROCEEDS BUT WHERE AMID ALL THIS IS JUSTICE SON OF ARISTON
TELL ME WHERE
LIGHT A CANDLE AND SEARCH THE CITY AND GET YOUR BROTHER
AND THE REST OF OUR FRIENDS TO HELP IN SEEKING FOR HER
'THAT WON'T DO
REPLIED GLAUCON 'YOU YOURSELF PROMISED TO MAKE THE SEARCH AND TALKED
ABOUT THE IMPIETY OF DESERTING JUSTICE WELL I SAID I WILL LEAD THE
WAY BUT DO YOU FOLLOW
MY NOTION IS THAT OUR STATE BEING PERFECT WILL
CONTAIN ALL THE FOUR VIRTUES WISDOM COURAGE TEMPERANCE JUSTICE
IF
WE ELIMINATE THE THREE FIRST THE UNKNOWN REMAINDER WILL BE JUSTICE
FIRST THEN OF WISDOM THE STATE WHICH WE HAVE CALLED INTO BEING WILL BE
WISE BECAUSE POLITIC
AND POLICY IS ONE AMONG MANY KINDS OF SKILL NOT
THE SKILL OF THE CARPENTER OR OF THE WORKER IN METAL OR OF THE
HUSBANDMAN BUT THE SKILL OF HIM WHO ADVISES ABOUT THE INTERESTS OF THE
WHOLE STATE
OF SUCH A KIND IS THE SKILL OF THE GUARDIANS WHO ARE A
SMALL CLASS IN NUMBER FAR SMALLER THAN THE BLACKSMITHS BUT IN THEM
IS CONCENTRATED THE WISDOM OF THE STATE
AND IF THIS SMALL RULING CLASS
HAVE WISDOM THEN THE WHOLE STATE WILL BE WISE
OUR SECOND VIRTUE IS COURAGE WHICH WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING
IN ANOTHER CLASS THAT OF SOLDIERS
COURAGE MAY BE DEFINED AS A SORT
OF SALVATION THE NEVER FAILING SALVATION OF THE OPINIONS WHICH LAW AND
EDUCATION HAVE PRESCRIBED CONCERNING DANGERS
YOU KNOW THE WAY IN WHICH
DYERS FIRST PREPARE THE WHITE GROUND AND THEN LAY ON THE DYE OF PURPLE
OR OF ANY OTHER COLOUR
COLOURS DYED IN THIS WAY BECOME FIXED AND NO
SOAP OR LYE WILL EVER WASH THEM OUT
NOW THE GROUND IS EDUCATION AND
THE LAWS ARE THE COLOURS AND IF THE GROUND IS PROPERLY LAID NEITHER
THE SOAP OF PLEASURE NOR THE LYE OF PAIN OR FEAR WILL EVER WASH THEM
OUT
THIS POWER WHICH PRESERVES RIGHT OPINION ABOUT DANGER I WOULD ASK
YOU TO CALL 'COURAGE ADDING THE EPITHET 'POLITICAL' OR 'CIVILIZED'
IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM MERE ANIMAL COURAGE AND FROM A HIGHER
COURAGE WHICH MAY HEREAFTER BE DISCUSSED
TWO VIRTUES REMAIN TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE
MORE THAN THE PRECEDING
VIRTUES TEMPERANCE SUGGESTS THE IDEA OF HARMONY
SOME LIGHT IS THROWN
UPON THE NATURE OF THIS VIRTUE BY THE POPULAR DESCRIPTION OF A MAN AS
'MASTER OF HIMSELF' WHICH HAS AN ABSURD SOUND BECAUSE THE MASTER IS
ALSO THE SERVANT
THE EXPRESSION REALLY MEANS THAT THE BETTER PRINCIPLE
IN A MAN MASTERS THE WORSE
THERE ARE IN CITIES WHOLE CLASSES WOMEN
SLAVES AND THE LIKE WHO CORRESPOND TO THE WORSE AND A FEW ONLY TO THE
BETTER AND IN OUR STATE THE FORMER CLASS ARE HELD UNDER CONTROL BY THE
LATTER
NOW TO WHICH OF THESE CLASSES DOES TEMPERANCE BELONG 'TO BOTH
OF THEM AND OUR STATE IF ANY WILL BE THE ABODE OF TEMPERANCE AND
WE WERE RIGHT IN DESCRIBING THIS VIRTUE AS A HARMONY WHICH IS DIFFUSED
THROUGH THE WHOLE MAKING THE DWELLERS IN THE CITY TO BE OF ONE MIND
AND ATTUNING THE UPPER AND MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASSES LIKE THE STRINGS OF
AN INSTRUMENT WHETHER YOU SUPPOSE THEM TO DIFFER IN WISDOM STRENGTH OR
WEALTH
AND NOW WE ARE NEAR THE SPOT LET US DRAW IN AND SURROUND THE COVER AND
WATCH WITH ALL OUR EYES LEST JUSTICE SHOULD SLIP AWAY AND ESCAPE
TELL
ME IF YOU SEE THE THICKET MOVE FIRST
'NAY I WOULD HAVE YOU LEAD
WELL THEN OFFER UP A PRAYER AND FOLLOW
THE WAY IS DARK AND DIFFICULT
BUT WE MUST PUSH ON
I BEGIN TO SEE A TRACK
'GOOD NEWS WHY GLAUCON
OUR DULNESS OF SCENT IS QUITE LUDICROUS WHILE WE ARE STRAINING OUR EYES
INTO THE DISTANCE JUSTICE IS TUMBLING OUT AT OUR FEET
WE ARE AS BAD
AS PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A THING WHICH THEY HAVE IN THEIR HANDS
HAVE YOU
FORGOTTEN OUR OLD PRINCIPLE OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR OR OF EVERY MAN
DOING HIS OWN BUSINESS CONCERNING WHICH WE SPOKE AT THE FOUNDATION
OF THE STATE WHAT BUT THIS WAS JUSTICE IS THERE ANY OTHER VIRTUE
REMAINING WHICH CAN COMPETE WITH WISDOM AND TEMPERANCE AND COURAGE IN
THE SCALE OF POLITICAL VIRTUE FOR 'EVERY ONE HAVING HIS OWN' IS THE
GREAT OBJECT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE GREAT OBJECT OF TRADE IS THAT
EVERY MAN SHOULD DO HIS OWN BUSINESS
NOT THAT THERE IS MUCH HARM IN A
CARPENTER TRYING TO BE A COBBLER OR A COBBLER TRANSFORMING HIMSELF INTO
A CARPENTER BUT GREAT EVIL MAY ARISE FROM THE COBBLER LEAVING HIS LAST
AND TURNING INTO A GUARDIAN OR LEGISLATOR OR WHEN A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL
IS TRAINER WARRIOR LEGISLATOR ALL IN ONE
AND THIS EVIL IS INJUSTICE
OR EVERY MAN DOING ANOTHER'S BUSINESS
I DO NOT SAY THAT AS YET WE ARE
IN A CONDITION TO ARRIVE AT A FINAL CONCLUSION
FOR THE DEFINITION
WHICH WE BELIEVE TO HOLD GOOD IN STATES HAS STILL TO BE TESTED BY THE
INDIVIDUAL
HAVING READ THE LARGE LETTERS WE WILL NOW COME BACK TO THE
SMALL
FROM THE TWO TOGETHER A BRILLIANT LIGHT MAY BE STRUCK OUT
SOCRATES PROCEEDS TO DISCOVER THE NATURE OF JUSTICE BY A METHOD OF
RESIDUES
EACH OF THE FIRST THREE VIRTUES CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE
THREE PARTS OF THE SOUL AND ONE OF THE THREE CLASSES IN THE STATE
ALTHOUGH THE THIRD TEMPERANCE HAS MORE OF THE NATURE OF A HARMONY THAN
THE FIRST TWO
IF THERE BE A FOURTH VIRTUE THAT CAN ONLY BE SOUGHT FOR
IN THE RELATION OF THE THREE PARTS IN THE SOUL OR CLASSES IN THE STATE
TO ONE ANOTHER
IT IS OBVIOUS AND SIMPLE AND FOR THAT VERY REASON HAS
NOT BEEN FOUND OUT
THE MODERN LOGICIAN WILL BE INCLINED TO OBJECT THAT
IDEAS CANNOT BE SEPARATED LIKE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES BUT THAT THEY RUN
INTO ONE ANOTHER AND MAY BE ONLY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OR NAMES OF THE
SAME THING AND SUCH IN THIS INSTANCE APPEARS TO BE THE CASE
FOR THE
DEFINITION HERE GIVEN OF JUSTICE IS VERBALLY THE SAME AS ONE OF THE
DEFINITIONS OF TEMPERANCE GIVEN BY SOCRATES IN THE CHARMIDES WHICH
HOWEVER IS ONLY PROVISIONAL AND IS AFTERWARDS REJECTED
AND SO FAR
FROM JUSTICE REMAINING OVER WHEN THE OTHER VIRTUES ARE ELIMINATED
THE JUSTICE AND TEMPERANCE OF THE REPUBLIC CAN WITH DIFFICULTY BE
DISTINGUISHED
TEMPERANCE APPEARS TO BE THE VIRTUE OF A PART ONLY AND
ONE OF THREE WHEREAS JUSTICE IS A UNIVERSAL VIRTUE OF THE WHOLE SOUL
YET ON THE OTHER HAND TEMPERANCE IS ALSO DESCRIBED AS A SORT OF HARMONY
AND IN THIS RESPECT IS AKIN TO JUSTICE
JUSTICE SEEMS TO DIFFER FROM
TEMPERANCE IN DEGREE RATHER THAN IN KIND WHEREAS TEMPERANCE IS THE
HARMONY OF DISCORDANT ELEMENTS JUSTICE IS THE PERFECT ORDER BY WHICH
ALL NATURES AND CLASSES DO THEIR OWN BUSINESS THE RIGHT MAN IN THE
RIGHT PLACE THE DIVISION AND CO OPERATION OF ALL THE CITIZENS
JUSTICE
AGAIN IS A MORE ABSTRACT NOTION THAN THE OTHER VIRTUES AND THEREFORE
FROM PLATO'S POINT OF VIEW THE FOUNDATION OF THEM TO WHICH THEY
ARE REFERRED AND WHICH IN IDEA PRECEDES THEM
THE PROPOSAL TO OMIT
TEMPERANCE IS A MERE TRICK OF STYLE INTENDED TO AVOID MONOTONY
THERE IS A FAMOUS QUESTION DISCUSSED IN ONE OF THE EARLIER DIALOGUES OF
PLATO PROTAGORAS ARIST
NIC
ETHICS 'WHETHER THE VIRTUES ARE ONE
OR MANY THIS RECEIVES AN ANSWER WHICH IS TO THE EFFECT THAT THERE
ARE FOUR CARDINAL VIRTUES NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME BROUGHT TOGETHER IN
ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY AND ONE SUPREME OVER THE REST WHICH IS NOT LIKE
ARISTOTLE'S CONCEPTION OF UNIVERSAL JUSTICE VIRTUE RELATIVE TO OTHERS
BUT THE WHOLE OF VIRTUE RELATIVE TO THE PARTS
TO THIS UNIVERSAL
CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE OR ORDER IN THE FIRST EDUCATION AND IN THE MORAL
NATURE OF MAN THE STILL MORE UNIVERSAL CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD IN THE
SECOND EDUCATION AND IN THE SPHERE OF SPECULATIVE KNOWLEDGE SEEMS TO
SUCCEED
BOTH MIGHT BE EQUALLY DESCRIBED BY THE TERMS 'LAW 'ORDER
'HARMONY BUT WHILE THE IDEA OF GOOD EMBRACES 'ALL TIME AND ALL
EXISTENCE THE CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE IS NOT EXTENDED BEYOND MAN
SOCRATES IS NOW GOING TO IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE
BUT
FIRST HE MUST PROVE THAT THERE ARE THREE PARTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL
HIS ARGUMENT IS AS FOLLOWS QUANTITY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY
THE WORD 'JUST WHETHER APPLIED TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR TO THE STATE HAS
THE SAME MEANING
AND THE TERM 'JUSTICE' IMPLIED THAT THE SAME THREE
PRINCIPLES IN THE STATE AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL WERE DOING THEIR OWN
BUSINESS
BUT ARE THEY REALLY THREE OR ONE THE QUESTION IS DIFFICULT
AND ONE WHICH CAN HARDLY BE SOLVED BY THE METHODS WHICH WE ARE NOW
USING BUT THE TRUER AND LONGER WAY WOULD TAKE UP TOO MUCH OF OUR TIME
'THE SHORTER WILL SATISFY ME WELL THEN YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT THE
QUALITIES OF STATES MEAN THE QUALITIES OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO COMPOSE
THEM THE SCYTHIANS AND THRACIANS ARE PASSIONATE OUR OWN RACE
INTELLECTUAL AND THE EGYPTIANS AND PHOENICIANS COVETOUS BECAUSE
THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF EACH HAVE SUCH AND SUCH A CHARACTER THE
DIFFICULTY IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SEVERAL PRINCIPLES ARE ONE OR
THREE WHETHER THAT IS TO SAY WE REASON WITH ONE PART OF OUR NATURE
DESIRE WITH ANOTHER ARE ANGRY WITH ANOTHER OR WHETHER THE WHOLE SOUL
COMES INTO PLAY IN EACH SORT OF ACTION
THIS ENQUIRY HOWEVER REQUIRES
A VERY EXACT DEFINITION OF TERMS
THE SAME THING IN THE SAME RELATION
CANNOT BE AFFECTED IN TWO OPPOSITE WAYS
BUT THERE IS NO IMPOSSIBILITY
IN A MAN STANDING STILL YET MOVING HIS ARMS OR IN A TOP WHICH IS FIXED
ON ONE SPOT GOING ROUND UPON ITS AXIS
THERE IS NO NECESSITY TO MENTION
ALL THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTIONS LET US PROVISIONALLY ASSUME THAT OPPOSITES
CANNOT DO OR BE OR SUFFER OPPOSITES IN THE SAME RELATION
AND TO THE
CLASS OF OPPOSITES BELONG ASSENT AND DISSENT DESIRE AND AVOIDANCE
AND ONE FORM OF DESIRE IS THIRST AND HUNGER AND HERE ARISES A NEW
POINT THIRST IS THIRST OF DRINK HUNGER IS HUNGER OF FOOD NOT OF WARM
DRINK OR OF A PARTICULAR KIND OF FOOD WITH THE SINGLE EXCEPTION OF
COURSE THAT THE VERY FACT OF OUR DESIRING ANYTHING IMPLIES THAT IT IS
GOOD
WHEN RELATIVE TERMS HAVE NO ATTRIBUTES THEIR CORRELATIVES HAVE
NO ATTRIBUTES WHEN THEY HAVE ATTRIBUTES THEIR CORRELATIVES ALSO HAVE
THEM
FOR EXAMPLE THE TERM 'GREATER' IS SIMPLY RELATIVE TO 'LESS AND
KNOWLEDGE REFERS TO A SUBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND A
PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE IS OF A PARTICULAR SUBJECT
AGAIN EVERY SCIENCE
HAS A DISTINCT CHARACTER WHICH IS DEFINED BY AN OBJECT MEDICINE FOR
EXAMPLE IS THE SCIENCE OF HEALTH ALTHOUGH NOT TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH
HEALTH
HAVING CLEARED OUR IDEAS THUS FAR LET US RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL
INSTANCE OF THIRST WHICH HAS A DEFINITE OBJECT DRINK
NOW THE THIRSTY
SOUL MAY FEEL TWO DISTINCT IMPULSES THE ANIMAL ONE SAYING 'DRINK
THE RATIONAL ONE WHICH SAYS 'DO NOT DRINK THE TWO IMPULSES ARE
CONTRADICTORY AND THEREFORE WE MAY ASSUME THAT THEY SPRING FROM
DISTINCT PRINCIPLES IN THE SOUL
BUT IS PASSION A THIRD PRINCIPLE OR
AKIN TO DESIRE THERE IS A STORY OF A CERTAIN LEONTIUS WHICH THROWS SOME
LIGHT ON THIS QUESTION
HE WAS COMING UP FROM THE PIRAEUS OUTSIDE THE
NORTH WALL AND HE PASSED A SPOT WHERE THERE WERE DEAD BODIES LYING
BY THE EXECUTIONER
HE FELT A LONGING DESIRE TO SEE THEM AND ALSO AN
ABHORRENCE OF THEM AT FIRST HE TURNED AWAY AND SHUT HIS EYES THEN
SUDDENLY TEARING THEM OPEN HE SAID 'TAKE YOUR FILL YE WRETCHES OF
THE FAIR SIGHT NOW IS THERE NOT HERE A THIRD PRINCIPLE WHICH IS OFTEN
FOUND TO COME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF REASON AGAINST DESIRE BUT NEVER
OF DESIRE AGAINST REASON THIS IS PASSION OR SPIRIT OF THE SEPARATE
EXISTENCE OF WHICH WE MAY FURTHER CONVINCE OURSELVES BY PUTTING THE
FOLLOWING CASE WHEN A MAN SUFFERS JUSTLY IF HE BE OF A GENEROUS
NATURE HE IS NOT INDIGNANT AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH HE UNDERGOES BUT WHEN
HE SUFFERS UNJUSTLY HIS INDIGNATION IS HIS GREAT SUPPORT HUNGER AND
THIRST CANNOT TAME HIM THE SPIRIT WITHIN HIM MUST DO OR DIE UNTIL THE
VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD THAT IS OF REASON BIDDING HIS DOG BARK NO
MORE IS HEARD WITHIN
THIS SHOWS THAT PASSION IS THE ALLY OF REASON
IS
PASSION THEN THE SAME WITH REASON NO FOR THE FORMER EXISTS IN CHILDREN
AND BRUTES AND HOMER AFFORDS A PROOF OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM
WHEN HE SAYS 'HE SMOTE HIS BREAST AND THUS REBUKED HIS SOUL
AND NOW AT LAST WE HAVE REACHED FIRM GROUND AND ARE ABLE TO INFER
THAT THE VIRTUES OF THE STATE AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL ARE THE SAME
FOR
WISDOM AND COURAGE AND JUSTICE IN THE STATE ARE SEVERALLY THE WISDOM AND
COURAGE AND JUSTICE IN THE INDIVIDUALS WHO FORM THE STATE
EACH OF THE
THREE CLASSES WILL DO THE WORK OF ITS OWN CLASS IN THE STATE AND EACH
PART IN THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL REASON THE SUPERIOR AND PASSION THE
INFERIOR WILL BE HARMONIZED BY THE INFLUENCE OF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC
THE COUNSELLOR AND THE WARRIOR THE HEAD AND THE ARM WILL ACT TOGETHER
IN THE TOWN OF MANSOUL AND KEEP THE DESIRES IN PROPER SUBJECTION
THE
COURAGE OF THE WARRIOR IS THAT QUALITY WHICH PRESERVES A RIGHT OPINION
ABOUT DANGERS IN SPITE OF PLEASURES AND PAINS
THE WISDOM OF THE
COUNSELLOR IS THAT SMALL PART OF THE SOUL WHICH HAS AUTHORITY AND
REASON
THE VIRTUE OF TEMPERANCE IS THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE RULING AND THE
SUBJECT PRINCIPLES BOTH IN THE STATE AND IN THE INDIVIDUAL
OF JUSTICE
WE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN AND THE NOTION ALREADY GIVEN OF IT MAY
BE CONFIRMED BY COMMON INSTANCES
WILL THE JUST STATE OR THE JUST
INDIVIDUAL STEAL LIE COMMIT ADULTERY OR BE GUILTY OF IMPIETY TO
GODS AND MEN 'NO AND IS NOT THE REASON OF THIS THAT THE SEVERAL
PRINCIPLES WHETHER IN THE STATE OR IN THE INDIVIDUAL DO THEIR OWN
BUSINESS AND JUSTICE IS THE QUALITY WHICH MAKES JUST MEN AND JUST
STATES
MOREOVER OUR OLD DIVISION OF LABOUR WHICH REQUIRED THAT THERE
SHOULD BE ONE MAN FOR ONE USE WAS A DREAM OR ANTICIPATION OF WHAT WAS
TO FOLLOW AND THAT DREAM HAS NOW BEEN REALIZED IN JUSTICE WHICH
BEGINS BY BINDING TOGETHER THE THREE CHORDS OF THE SOUL AND THEN ACTS
HARMONIOUSLY IN EVERY RELATION OF LIFE
AND INJUSTICE WHICH IS THE
INSUBORDINATION AND DISOBEDIENCE OF THE INFERIOR ELEMENTS IN THE SOUL
IS THE OPPOSITE OF JUSTICE AND IS INHARMONIOUS AND UNNATURAL BEING TO
THE SOUL WHAT DISEASE IS TO THE BODY FOR IN THE SOUL AS WELL AS IN THE
BODY GOOD OR BAD ACTIONS PRODUCE GOOD OR BAD HABITS
AND VIRTUE IS THE
HEALTH AND BEAUTY AND WELL BEING OF THE SOUL AND VICE IS THE DISEASE
AND WEAKNESS AND DEFORMITY OF THE SOUL
AGAIN THE OLD QUESTION RETURNS UPON US IS JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE THE
MORE PROFITABLE THE QUESTION HAS BECOME RIDICULOUS
FOR INJUSTICE LIKE
MORTAL DISEASE MAKES LIFE NOT WORTH HAVING
COME UP WITH ME TO THE HILL
WHICH OVERHANGS THE CITY AND LOOK DOWN UPON THE SINGLE FORM OF VIRTUE
AND THE INFINITE FORMS OF VICE AMONG WHICH ARE FOUR SPECIAL ONES
CHARACTERISTIC BOTH OF STATES AND OF INDIVIDUALS
AND THE STATE WHICH
CORRESPONDS TO THE SINGLE FORM OF VIRTUE IS THAT WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBING WHEREIN REASON RULES UNDER ONE OF TWO NAMES MONARCHY AND
ARISTOCRACY
THUS THERE ARE FIVE FORMS IN ALL BOTH OF STATES AND OF
SOULS
IN ATTEMPTING TO PROVE THAT THE SOUL HAS THREE SEPARATE FACULTIES PLATO
TAKES OCCASION TO DISCUSS WHAT MAKES DIFFERENCE OF FACULTIES
AND
THE CRITERION WHICH HE PROPOSES IS DIFFERENCE IN THE WORKING OF THE
FACULTIES
THE SAME FACULTY CANNOT PRODUCE CONTRADICTORY EFFECTS
BUT
THE PATH OF EARLY REASONERS IS BESET BY THORNY ENTANGLEMENTS AND HE
WILL NOT PROCEED A STEP WITHOUT FIRST CLEARING THE GROUND
THIS LEADS
HIM INTO A TIRESOME DIGRESSION WHICH IS INTENDED TO EXPLAIN THE NATURE
OF CONTRADICTION
FIRST THE CONTRADICTION MUST BE AT THE SAME TIME AND
IN THE SAME RELATION
SECONDLY NO EXTRANEOUS WORD MUST BE INTRODUCED
INTO EITHER OF THE TERMS IN WHICH THE CONTRADICTORY PROPOSITION IS
EXPRESSED FOR EXAMPLE THIRST IS OF DRINK NOT OF WARM DRINK
HE
IMPLIES WHAT HE DOES NOT SAY THAT IF BY THE ADVICE OF REASON OR BY
THE IMPULSE OF ANGER A MAN IS RESTRAINED FROM DRINKING THIS PROVES
THAT THIRST OR DESIRE UNDER WHICH THIRST IS INCLUDED IS DISTINCT
FROM ANGER AND REASON
BUT SUPPOSE THAT WE ALLOW THE TERM 'THIRST' OR
'DESIRE' TO BE MODIFIED AND SAY AN 'ANGRY THIRST OR A 'REVENGEFUL
DESIRE THEN THE TWO SPHERES OF DESIRE AND ANGER OVERLAP AND BECOME
CONFUSED
THIS CASE THEREFORE HAS TO BE EXCLUDED
AND STILL THERE
REMAINS AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE IN THE USE OF THE TERM 'GOOD WHICH IS
ALWAYS IMPLIED IN THE OBJECT OF DESIRE
THESE ARE THE DISCUSSIONS OF
AN AGE BEFORE LOGIC AND ANY ONE WHO IS WEARIED BY THEM SHOULD REMEMBER
THAT THEY ARE NECESSARY TO THE CLEARING UP OF IDEAS IN THE FIRST
DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN FACULTIES
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PLATO EXTENDS NO FURTHER THAN THE DIVISION OF THE SOUL
INTO THE RATIONAL IRASCIBLE AND CONCUPISCENT ELEMENTS WHICH AS FAR
AS WE KNOW WAS FIRST MADE BY HIM AND HAS BEEN RETAINED BY ARISTOTLE
AND SUCCEEDING ETHICAL WRITERS
THE CHIEF DIFFICULTY IN THIS EARLY
ANALYSIS OF THE MIND IS TO DEFINE EXACTLY THE PLACE OF THE IRASCIBLE
FACULTY GREEK WHICH MAY BE VARIOUSLY DESCRIBED UNDER THE TERMS
RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION SPIRIT PASSION
IT IS THE FOUNDATION OF COURAGE
WHICH INCLUDES IN PLATO MORAL COURAGE THE COURAGE OF ENDURING PAIN AND
OF SURMOUNTING INTELLECTUAL DIFFICULTIES AS WELL AS OF MEETING DANGERS
IN WAR
THOUGH IRRATIONAL IT INCLINES TO SIDE WITH THE RATIONAL IT
CANNOT BE AROUSED BY PUNISHMENT WHEN JUSTLY INFLICTED IT SOMETIMES
TAKES THE FORM OF AN ENTHUSIASM WHICH SUSTAINS A MAN IN THE PERFORMANCE
OF GREAT ACTIONS
IT IS THE 'LION HEART' WITH WHICH THE REASON MAKES
A TREATY
ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS NEGATIVE RATHER THAN POSITIVE IT
IS INDIGNANT AT WRONG OR FALSEHOOD BUT DOES NOT LIKE LOVE IN THE
SYMPOSIUM AND PHAEDRUS ASPIRE TO THE VISION OF TRUTH OR GOOD
IT IS THE
PEREMPTORY MILITARY SPIRIT WHICH PREVAILS IN THE GOVERNMENT OF HONOUR
IT DIFFERS FROM ANGER GREEK THIS LATTER TERM HAVING NO ACCESSORY
NOTION OF RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION
ALTHOUGH ARISTOTLE HAS RETAINED THE
WORD YET WE MAY OBSERVE THAT 'PASSION' GREEK HAS WITH HIM LOST ITS
AFFINITY TO THE RATIONAL AND HAS BECOME INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM 'ANGER'
GREEK
AND TO THIS VERNACULAR USE PLATO HIMSELF IN THE LAWS SEEMS TO
REVERT THOUGH NOT ALWAYS
BY MODERN PHILOSOPHY TOO AS WELL AS IN OUR
ORDINARY CONVERSATION THE WORDS ANGER OR PASSION ARE EMPLOYED ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY IN A BAD SENSE THERE IS NO CONNOTATION OF A JUST OR
REASONABLE CAUSE BY WHICH THEY ARE AROUSED
THE FEELING OF 'RIGHTEOUS
INDIGNATION' IS TOO PARTIAL AND ACCIDENTAL TO ADMIT OF OUR REGARDING
IT AS A SEPARATE VIRTUE OR HABIT
WE ARE TEMPTED ALSO TO DOUBT WHETHER
PLATO IS RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THAT AN OFFENDER HOWEVER JUSTLY CONDEMNED
COULD BE EXPECTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE JUSTICE OF HIS SENTENCE THIS IS
THE SPIRIT OF A PHILOSOPHER OR MARTYR RATHER THAN OF A CRIMINAL
WE MAY OBSERVE HOW NEARLY PLATO APPROACHES ARISTOTLE'S FAMOUS THESIS
THAT 'GOOD ACTIONS PRODUCE GOOD HABITS THE WORDS 'AS HEALTHY PRACTICES
GREEK PRODUCE HEALTH SO DO JUST PRACTICES PRODUCE JUSTICE HAVE
A SOUND VERY LIKE THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS
BUT WE NOTE ALSO THAT AN
INCIDENTAL REMARK IN PLATO HAS BECOME A FAR REACHING PRINCIPLE IN
ARISTOTLE AND AN INSEPARABLE PART OF A GREAT ETHICAL SYSTEM
THERE IS A DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT PLATO MEANT BY 'THE LONGER
WAY' HE SEEMS TO INTIMATE SOME METAPHYSIC OF THE FUTURE WHICH WILL NOT
BE SATISFIED WITH ARGUING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRADICTION
IN THE
SIXTH AND SEVENTH BOOKS COMPARE SOPHIST AND PARMENIDES HE HAS GIVEN
US A SKETCH OF SUCH A METAPHYSIC BUT WHEN GLAUCON ASKS FOR THE FINAL
REVELATION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD HE IS PUT OFF WITH THE DECLARATION
THAT HE HAS NOT YET STUDIED THE PRELIMINARY SCIENCES
HOW HE WOULD HAVE
FILLED UP THE SKETCH OR ARGUED ABOUT SUCH QUESTIONS FROM A HIGHER POINT
OF VIEW WE CAN ONLY CONJECTURE
PERHAPS HE HOPED TO FIND SOME A PRIORI
METHOD OF DEVELOPING THE PARTS OUT OF THE WHOLE OR HE MIGHT HAVE ASKED
WHICH OF THE IDEAS CONTAINS THE OTHER IDEAS AND POSSIBLY HAVE STUMBLED
ON THE HEGELIAN IDENTITY OF THE 'EGO' AND THE 'UNIVERSAL OR HE MAY
HAVE IMAGINED THAT IDEAS MIGHT BE CONSTRUCTED IN SOME MANNER ANALOGOUS
TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIGURES AND NUMBERS IN THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
THE MOST CERTAIN AND NECESSARY TRUTH WAS TO PLATO THE UNIVERSAL AND TO
THIS HE WAS ALWAYS SEEKING TO REFER ALL KNOWLEDGE OR OPINION JUST AS IN
MODERN TIMES WE SEEK TO REST THEM ON THE OPPOSITE POLE OF INDUCTION AND
EXPERIENCE
THE ASPIRATIONS OF METAPHYSICIANS HAVE ALWAYS TENDED TO
PASS BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE THEY SEEM TO HAVE
REACHED A HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY ARE 'MOVING ABOUT IN WORLDS UNREALIZED
AND THEIR CONCEPTIONS ALTHOUGH PROFOUNDLY AFFECTING THEIR OWN MINDS
BECOME INVISIBLE OR UNINTELLIGIBLE TO OTHERS
WE ARE NOT THEREFORE
SURPRIZED TO FIND THAT PLATO HIMSELF HAS NOWHERE CLEARLY EXPLAINED HIS
DOCTRINE OF IDEAS OR THAT HIS SCHOOL IN A LATER GENERATION LIKE HIS
CONTEMPORARIES GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS WERE UNABLE TO FOLLOW HIM IN
THIS REGION OF SPECULATION
IN THE SOPHIST WHERE HE IS REFUTING THE
SCEPTICISM WHICH MAINTAINED EITHER THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS
PREDICATION OR THAT ALL MIGHT BE PREDICATED OF ALL HE ARRIVES AT THE
CONCLUSION THAT SOME IDEAS COMBINE WITH SOME BUT NOT ALL WITH ALL
BUT
HE MAKES ONLY ONE OR TWO STEPS FORWARD ON THIS PATH HE NOWHERE ATTAINS
TO ANY CONNECTED SYSTEM OF IDEAS OR EVEN TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOST
ELEMENTARY RELATIONS OF THE SCIENCES TO ONE ANOTHER
BOOK V
I WAS GOING TO ENUMERATE THE FOUR FORMS OF VICE OR DECLINE IN
STATES WHEN POLEMARCHUS HE WAS SITTING A LITTLE FARTHER FROM ME
THAN ADEIMANTUS TAKING HIM BY THE COAT AND LEANING TOWARDS HIM SAID
SOMETHING IN AN UNDERTONE OF WHICH I ONLY CAUGHT THE WORDS 'SHALL WE
LET HIM OFF 'CERTAINLY NOT SAID ADEIMANTUS RAISING HIS VOICE
WHOM
I SAID ARE YOU NOT GOING TO LET OFF 'YOU HE SAID
WHY 'BECAUSE
WE THINK THAT YOU ARE NOT DEALING FAIRLY WITH US IN OMITTING WOMEN AND
CHILDREN OF WHOM YOU HAVE SLILY DISPOSED UNDER THE GENERAL FORMULA
THAT FRIENDS HAVE ALL THINGS IN COMMON AND WAS I NOT RIGHT 'YES
HE REPLIED 'BUT THERE ARE MANY SORTS OF COMMUNISM OR COMMUNITY AND
WE WANT TO KNOW WHICH OF THEM IS RIGHT
THE COMPANY AS YOU HAVE JUST
HEARD ARE RESOLVED TO HAVE A FURTHER EXPLANATION THRASYMACHUS SAID
'DO YOU THINK THAT WE HAVE COME HITHER TO DIG FOR GOLD OR TO HEAR YOU
DISCOURSE YES I SAID BUT THE DISCOURSE SHOULD BE OF A REASONABLE
LENGTH
GLAUCON ADDED 'YES SOCRATES AND THERE IS REASON IN SPENDING
THE WHOLE OF LIFE IN SUCH DISCUSSIONS BUT PRAY WITHOUT MORE ADO TELL
US HOW THIS COMMUNITY IS TO BE CARRIED OUT AND HOW THE INTERVAL BETWEEN
BIRTH AND EDUCATION IS TO BE FILLED UP WELL I SAID THE SUBJECT HAS
SEVERAL DIFFICULTIES WHAT IS POSSIBLE IS THE FIRST QUESTION
WHAT IS
DESIRABLE IS THE SECOND
'FEAR NOT HE REPLIED 'FOR YOU ARE SPEAKING
AMONG FRIENDS THAT I REPLIED IS A SORRY CONSOLATION I SHALL
DESTROY MY FRIENDS AS WELL AS MYSELF
NOT THAT I MIND A LITTLE INNOCENT
LAUGHTER BUT HE WHO KILLS THE TRUTH IS A MURDERER
'THEN SAID
GLAUCON LAUGHING 'IN CASE YOU SHOULD MURDER US WE WILL ACQUIT YOU
BEFOREHAND AND YOU SHALL BE HELD FREE FROM THE GUILT OF DECEIVING US
SOCRATES PROCEEDS THE GUARDIANS OF OUR STATE ARE TO BE WATCH DOGS AS
WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
NOW DOGS ARE NOT DIVIDED INTO HES AND SHES WE DO
NOT TAKE THE MASCULINE GENDER OUT TO HUNT AND LEAVE THE FEMALES AT HOME
TO LOOK AFTER THEIR PUPPIES
THEY HAVE THE SAME EMPLOYMENTS THE ONLY
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS THAT THE ONE SEX IS STRONGER AND THE OTHER
WEAKER
BUT IF WOMEN ARE TO HAVE THE SAME EMPLOYMENTS AS MEN THEY MUST
HAVE THE SAME EDUCATION THEY MUST BE TAUGHT MUSIC AND GYMNASTICS AND
THE ART OF WAR
I KNOW THAT A GREAT JOKE WILL BE MADE OF THEIR RIDING
ON HORSEBACK AND CARRYING WEAPONS THE SIGHT OF THE NAKED OLD WRINKLED
WOMEN SHOWING THEIR AGILITY IN THE PALAESTRA WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE A
VISION OF BEAUTY AND MAY BE EXPECTED TO BECOME A FAMOUS JEST
BUT WE
MUST NOT MIND THE WITS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE LAUGHED AT
OUR PRESENT GYMNASTICS
ALL IS HABIT PEOPLE HAVE AT LAST FOUND OUT THAT
THE EXPOSURE IS BETTER THAN THE CONCEALMENT OF THE PERSON AND NOW THEY
LAUGH NO MORE
EVIL ONLY SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF RIDICULE
THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHETHER WOMEN ARE ABLE EITHER WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY
TO SHARE IN THE EMPLOYMENTS OF MEN
AND HERE WE MAY BE CHARGED WITH
INCONSISTENCY IN MAKING THE PROPOSAL AT ALL
FOR WE STARTED ORIGINALLY
WITH THE DIVISION OF LABOUR AND THE DIVERSITY OF EMPLOYMENTS WAS BASED
ON THE DIFFERENCE OF NATURES
BUT IS THERE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN
AND WOMEN NAY ARE THEY NOT WHOLLY DIFFERENT THERE WAS THE DIFFICULTY
GLAUCON WHICH MADE ME UNWILLING TO SPEAK OF FAMILY RELATIONS
HOWEVER
WHEN A MAN IS OUT OF HIS DEPTH WHETHER IN A POOL OR IN AN OCEAN HE CAN
ONLY SWIM FOR HIS LIFE AND WE MUST TRY TO FIND A WAY OF ESCAPE IF WE
CAN
THE ARGUMENT IS THAT DIFFERENT NATURES HAVE DIFFERENT USES AND THE
NATURES OF MEN AND WOMEN ARE SAID TO DIFFER
BUT THIS IS ONLY A VERBAL
OPPOSITION
WE DO NOT CONSIDER THAT THE DIFFERENCE MAY BE PURELY NOMINAL
AND ACCIDENTAL FOR EXAMPLE A BALD MAN AND A HAIRY MAN ARE OPPOSED IN A
SINGLE POINT OF VIEW BUT YOU CANNOT INFER THAT BECAUSE A BALD MAN IS
A COBBLER A HAIRY MAN OUGHT NOT TO BE A COBBLER
NOW WHY IS SUCH AN
INFERENCE ERRONEOUS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN THEM IS
PARTIAL ONLY LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MALE PHYSICIAN AND A FEMALE
PHYSICIAN NOT RUNNING THROUGH THE WHOLE NATURE LIKE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A PHYSICIAN AND A CARPENTER
AND IF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE SEXES
IS ONLY THAT THE ONE BEGET AND THE OTHER BEAR CHILDREN THIS DOES NOT
PROVE THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DISTINCT EDUCATIONS
ADMITTING THAT WOMEN
DIFFER FROM MEN IN CAPACITY DO NOT MEN EQUALLY DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER
HAS NOT NATURE SCATTERED ALL THE QUALITIES WHICH OUR CITIZENS REQUIRE
INDIFFERENTLY UP AND DOWN AMONG THE TWO SEXES AND EVEN IN THEIR
PECULIAR PURSUITS ARE NOT WOMEN OFTEN THOUGH IN SOME CASES SUPERIOR TO
MEN RIDICULOUSLY ENOUGH SURPASSED BY THEM WOMEN ARE THE SAME IN KIND
AS MEN AND HAVE THE SAME APTITUDE OR WANT OF APTITUDE FOR MEDICINE
OR GYMNASTIC OR WAR BUT IN A LESS DEGREE
ONE WOMAN WILL BE A GOOD
GUARDIAN ANOTHER NOT AND THE GOOD MUST BE CHOSEN TO BE THE COLLEAGUES
OF OUR GUARDIANS
IF HOWEVER THEIR NATURES ARE THE SAME THE INFERENCE
IS THAT THEIR EDUCATION MUST ALSO BE THE SAME THERE IS NO LONGER
ANYTHING UNNATURAL OR IMPOSSIBLE IN A WOMAN LEARNING MUSIC AND
GYMNASTIC
AND THE EDUCATION WHICH WE GIVE THEM WILL BE THE VERY BEST
FAR SUPERIOR TO THAT OF COBBLERS AND WILL TRAIN UP THE VERY BEST WOMEN
AND NOTHING CAN BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE STATE THAN THIS
THEREFORE
LET THEM STRIP CLOTHED IN THEIR CHASTITY AND SHARE IN THE TOILS OF WAR
AND IN THE DEFENCE OF THEIR COUNTRY HE WHO LAUGHS AT THEM IS A FOOL FOR
HIS PAINS
THE FIRST WAVE IS PAST AND THE ARGUMENT IS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT MEN
AND WOMEN HAVE COMMON DUTIES AND PURSUITS
A SECOND AND GREATER WAVE IS
ROLLING IN COMMUNITY OF WIVES AND CHILDREN IS THIS EITHER EXPEDIENT
OR POSSIBLE THE EXPEDIENCY I DO NOT DOUBT I AM NOT SO SURE OF THE
POSSIBILITY
'NAY I THINK THAT A CONSIDERABLE DOUBT WILL BE ENTERTAINED
ON BOTH POINTS I MEANT TO HAVE ESCAPED THE TROUBLE OF PROVING THE
FIRST BUT AS YOU HAVE DETECTED THE LITTLE STRATAGEM I MUST EVEN SUBMIT
ONLY ALLOW ME TO FEED MY FANCY LIKE THE SOLITARY IN HIS WALKS WITH A
DREAM OF WHAT MIGHT BE AND THEN I WILL RETURN TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT
CAN BE
IN THE FIRST PLACE OUR RULERS WILL ENFORCE THE LAWS AND MAKE NEW ONES
WHERE THEY ARE WANTED AND THEIR ALLIES OR MINISTERS WILL OBEY
YOU AS
LEGISLATOR HAVE ALREADY SELECTED THE MEN AND NOW YOU SHALL SELECT
THE WOMEN
AFTER THE SELECTION HAS BEEN MADE THEY WILL DWELL IN COMMON
HOUSES AND HAVE THEIR MEALS IN COMMON AND WILL BE BROUGHT TOGETHER BY
A NECESSITY MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT OF MATHEMATICS
BUT THEY CANNOT BE
ALLOWED TO LIVE IN LICENTIOUSNESS THAT IS AN UNHOLY THING WHICH
THE RULERS ARE DETERMINED TO PREVENT
FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF THIS HOLY
MARRIAGE FESTIVALS WILL BE INSTITUTED AND THEIR HOLINESS WILL BE IN
PROPORTION TO THEIR USEFULNESS
AND HERE GLAUCON I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK
AS I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A BREEDER OF BIRDS AND ANIMALS DO YOU NOT TAKE
THE GREATEST CARE IN THE MATING 'CERTAINLY AND THERE IS NO REASON TO
SUPPOSE THAT LESS CARE IS REQUIRED IN THE MARRIAGE OF HUMAN BEINGS
BUT
THEN OUR RULERS MUST BE SKILFUL PHYSICIANS OF THE STATE FOR THEY WILL
OFTEN NEED A STRONG DOSE OF FALSEHOOD IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT DESIRABLE
UNIONS BETWEEN THEIR SUBJECTS
THE GOOD MUST BE PAIRED WITH THE GOOD
AND THE BAD WITH THE BAD AND THE OFFSPRING OF THE ONE MUST BE REARED
AND OF THE OTHER DESTROYED IN THIS WAY THE FLOCK WILL BE PRESERVED IN
PRIME CONDITION
HYMENEAL FESTIVALS WILL BE CELEBRATED AT TIMES FIXED
WITH AN EYE TO POPULATION AND THE BRIDES AND BRIDEGROOMS WILL MEET AT
THEM AND BY AN INGENIOUS SYSTEM OF LOTS THE RULERS WILL CONTRIVE THAT
THE BRAVE AND THE FAIR COME TOGETHER AND THAT THOSE OF INFERIOR BREED
ARE PAIRED WITH INFERIORS THE LATTER WILL ASCRIBE TO CHANCE WHAT IS
REALLY THE INVENTION OF THE RULERS
AND WHEN CHILDREN ARE BORN THE
OFFSPRING OF THE BRAVE AND FAIR WILL BE CARRIED TO AN ENCLOSURE IN A
CERTAIN PART OF THE CITY AND THERE ATTENDED BY SUITABLE NURSES THE
REST WILL BE HURRIED AWAY TO PLACES UNKNOWN
THE MOTHERS WILL BE BROUGHT
TO THE FOLD AND WILL SUCKLE THE CHILDREN CARE HOWEVER MUST BE TAKEN
THAT NONE OF THEM RECOGNISE THEIR OWN OFFSPRING AND IF NECESSARY OTHER
NURSES MAY ALSO BE HIRED
THE TROUBLE OF WATCHING AND GETTING UP
AT NIGHT WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO ATTENDANTS
'THEN THE WIVES OF OUR
GUARDIANS WILL HAVE A FINE EASY TIME WHEN THEY ARE HAVING CHILDREN AND
QUITE RIGHT TOO I SAID THAT THEY SHOULD
THE PARENTS OUGHT TO BE IN THE PRIME OF LIFE WHICH FOR A MAN MAY BE
RECKONED AT THIRTY YEARS FROM TWENTY FIVE WHEN HE HAS 'PASSED THE
POINT AT WHICH THE SPEED OF LIFE IS GREATEST TO FIFTY FIVE AND AT
TWENTY YEARS FOR A WOMAN FROM TWENTY TO FORTY
ANY ONE ABOVE OR BELOW
THOSE AGES WHO PARTAKES IN THE HYMENEALS SHALL BE GUILTY OF IMPIETY
ALSO EVERY ONE WHO FORMS A MARRIAGE CONNEXION AT OTHER TIMES WITHOUT THE
CONSENT OF THE RULERS
THIS LATTER REGULATION APPLIES TO THOSE WHO ARE
WITHIN THE SPECIFIED AGES AFTER WHICH THEY MAY RANGE AT WILL PROVIDED
THEY AVOID THE PROHIBITED DEGREES OF PARENTS AND CHILDREN OR
OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHICH LAST HOWEVER ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY
PROHIBITED IF A DISPENSATION BE PROCURED
'BUT HOW SHALL WE KNOW THE
DEGREES OF AFFINITY WHEN ALL THINGS ARE COMMON THE ANSWER IS THAT
BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE ALL SUCH AS ARE BORN SEVEN OR NINE MONTHS AFTER
THE ESPOUSALS AND THEIR PARENTS THOSE WHO ARE THEN ESPOUSED AND EVERY
ONE WILL HAVE MANY CHILDREN AND EVERY CHILD MANY PARENTS
SOCRATES PROCEEDS I HAVE NOW TO PROVE THAT THIS SCHEME IS ADVANTAGEOUS
AND ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OUR ENTIRE POLITY
THE GREATEST GOOD OF A STATE
IS UNITY THE GREATEST EVIL DISCORD AND DISTRACTION
AND THERE WILL BE
UNITY WHERE THERE ARE NO PRIVATE PLEASURES OR PAINS OR INTERESTS WHERE
IF ONE MEMBER SUFFERS ALL THE MEMBERS SUFFER IF ONE CITIZEN IS TOUCHED
ALL ARE QUICKLY SENSITIVE AND THE LEAST HURT TO THE LITTLE FINGER OF
THE STATE RUNS THROUGH THE WHOLE BODY AND VIBRATES TO THE SOUL
FOR THE
TRUE STATE LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL IS INJURED AS A WHOLE WHEN ANY PART IS
AFFECTED
EVERY STATE HAS SUBJECTS AND RULERS WHO IN A DEMOCRACY ARE
CALLED RULERS AND IN OTHER STATES MASTERS BUT IN OUR STATE THEY ARE
CALLED SAVIOURS AND ALLIES AND THE SUBJECTS WHO IN OTHER STATES ARE
TERMED SLAVES ARE BY US TERMED NURTURERS AND PAYMASTERS AND THOSE WHO
ARE TERMED COMRADES AND COLLEAGUES IN OTHER PLACES ARE BY US CALLED
FATHERS AND BROTHERS
AND WHEREAS IN OTHER STATES MEMBERS OF THE SAME
GOVERNMENT REGARD ONE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES AS A FRIEND AND ANOTHER AS AN
ENEMY IN OUR STATE NO MAN IS A STRANGER TO ANOTHER FOR EVERY CITIZEN
IS CONNECTED WITH EVERY OTHER BY TIES OF BLOOD AND THESE NAMES AND
THIS WAY OF SPEAKING WILL HAVE A CORRESPONDING REALITY BROTHER FATHER
SISTER MOTHER REPEATED FROM INFANCY IN THE EARS OF CHILDREN WILL NOT
BE MERE WORDS
THEN AGAIN THE CITIZENS WILL HAVE ALL THINGS IN COMMON
IN HAVING COMMON PROPERTY THEY WILL HAVE COMMON PLEASURES AND PAINS
CAN THERE BE STRIFE AND CONTENTION AMONG THOSE WHO ARE OF ONE MIND OR
LAWSUITS ABOUT PROPERTY WHEN MEN HAVE NOTHING BUT THEIR BODIES WHICH
THEY CALL THEIR OWN OR SUITS ABOUT VIOLENCE WHEN EVERY ONE IS BOUND
TO DEFEND HIMSELF THE PERMISSION TO STRIKE WHEN INSULTED WILL BE AN
'ANTIDOTE' TO THE KNIFE AND WILL PREVENT DISTURBANCES IN THE STATE
BUT
NO YOUNGER MAN WILL STRIKE AN ELDER REVERENCE WILL PREVENT HIM FROM
LAYING HANDS ON HIS KINDRED AND HE WILL FEAR THAT THE REST OF THE
FAMILY MAY RETALIATE
MOREOVER OUR CITIZENS WILL BE RID OF THE
LESSER EVILS OF LIFE THERE WILL BE NO FLATTERY OF THE RICH NO SORDID
HOUSEHOLD CARES NO BORROWING AND NOT PAYING
COMPARED WITH THE
CITIZENS OF OTHER STATES OURS WILL BE OLYMPIC VICTORS AND CROWNED
WITH BLESSINGS GREATER STILL THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVING A BETTER
MAINTENANCE DURING LIFE AND AFTER DEATH AN HONOURABLE BURIAL
NOR HAS
THE HAPPINESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL BEEN SACRIFICED TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE
STATE OUR OLYMPIC VICTOR HAS NOT BEEN TURNED INTO A COBBLER BUT HE
HAS A HAPPINESS BEYOND THAT OF ANY COBBLER
AT THE SAME TIME IF ANY
CONCEITED YOUTH BEGINS TO DREAM OF APPROPRIATING THE STATE TO HIMSELF
HE MUST BE REMINDED THAT 'HALF IS BETTER THAN THE WHOLE 'I SHOULD
CERTAINLY ADVISE HIM TO STAY WHERE HE IS WHEN HE HAS THE PROMISE OF SUCH
A BRAVE LIFE
BUT IS SUCH A COMMUNITY POSSIBLE AS AMONG THE ANIMALS SO ALSO AMONG
MEN AND IF POSSIBLE IN WHAT WAY POSSIBLE ABOUT WAR THERE IS NO
DIFFICULTY THE PRINCIPLE OF COMMUNISM IS ADAPTED TO MILITARY SERVICE
PARENTS WILL TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO LOOK ON AT A BATTLE JUST AS
POTTERS' BOYS ARE TRAINED TO THE BUSINESS BY LOOKING ON AT THE WHEEL
AND TO THE PARENTS THEMSELVES AS TO OTHER ANIMALS THE SIGHT OF THEIR
YOUNG ONES WILL PROVE A GREAT INCENTIVE TO BRAVERY
YOUNG WARRIORS MUST
LEARN BUT THEY MUST NOT RUN INTO DANGER ALTHOUGH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF
RISK IS WORTH INCURRING WHEN THE BENEFIT IS GREAT
THE YOUNG CREATURES
SHOULD BE PLACED UNDER THE CARE OF EXPERIENCED VETERANS AND THEY SHOULD
HAVE WINGS THAT IS TO SAY SWIFT AND TRACTABLE STEEDS ON WHICH THEY MAY
FLY AWAY AND ESCAPE
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO BE DONE IS TO TEACH A
YOUTH TO RIDE
COWARDS AND DESERTERS SHALL BE DEGRADED TO THE CLASS OF HUSBANDMEN
GENTLEMEN WHO ALLOW THEMSELVES TO BE TAKEN PRISONERS MAY BE PRESENTED
TO THE ENEMY
BUT WHAT SHALL BE DONE TO THE HERO FIRST OF ALL HE SHALL
BE CROWNED BY ALL THE YOUTHS IN THE ARMY SECONDLY HE SHALL RECEIVE THE
RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP AND THIRDLY DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ANY
HARM IN HIS BEING KISSED WE HAVE ALREADY DETERMINED THAT HE SHALL HAVE
MORE WIVES THAN OTHERS IN ORDER THAT HE MAY HAVE AS MANY CHILDREN
AS POSSIBLE
AND AT A FEAST HE SHALL HAVE MORE TO EAT WE HAVE THE
AUTHORITY OF HOMER FOR HONOURING BRAVE MEN WITH 'LONG CHINES WHICH IS
AN APPROPRIATE COMPLIMENT BECAUSE MEAT IS A VERY STRENGTHENING THING
FILL THE BOWL THEN AND GIVE THE BEST SEATS AND MEATS TO THE BRAVE MAY
THEY DO THEM GOOD AND HE WHO DIES IN BATTLE WILL BE AT ONCE DECLARED TO
BE OF THE GOLDEN RACE AND WILL AS WE BELIEVE BECOME ONE OF HESIOD'S
GUARDIAN ANGELS
HE SHALL BE WORSHIPPED AFTER DEATH IN THE MANNER
PRESCRIBED BY THE ORACLE AND NOT ONLY HE BUT ALL OTHER BENEFACTORS
OF THE STATE WHO DIE IN ANY OTHER WAY SHALL BE ADMITTED TO THE SAME
HONOURS
THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW SHALL WE TREAT OUR ENEMIES SHALL HELLENES BE
ENSLAVED NO FOR THERE IS TOO GREAT A RISK OF THE WHOLE RACE PASSING
UNDER THE YOKE OF THE BARBARIANS
OR SHALL THE DEAD BE DESPOILED
CERTAINLY NOT FOR THAT SORT OF THING IS AN EXCUSE FOR SKULKING AND HAS
BEEN THE RUIN OF MANY AN ARMY
THERE IS MEANNESS AND FEMININE MALICE IN
MAKING AN ENEMY OF THE DEAD BODY WHEN THE SOUL WHICH WAS THE OWNER HAS
FLED LIKE A DOG WHO CANNOT REACH HIS ASSAILANTS AND QUARRELS WITH
THE STONES WHICH ARE THROWN AT HIM INSTEAD
AGAIN THE ARMS OF HELLENES
SHOULD NOT BE OFFERED UP IN THE TEMPLES OF THE GODS THEY ARE A
POLLUTION FOR THEY ARE TAKEN FROM BRETHREN
AND ON SIMILAR GROUNDS
THERE SHOULD BE A LIMIT TO THE DEVASTATION OF HELLENIC TERRITORY THE
HOUSES SHOULD NOT BE BURNT NOR MORE THAN THE ANNUAL PRODUCE CARRIED
OFF
FOR WAR IS OF TWO KINDS CIVIL AND FOREIGN THE FIRST OF WHICH IS
PROPERLY TERMED 'DISCORD AND ONLY THE SECOND 'WAR AND WAR BETWEEN
HELLENES IS IN REALITY CIVIL WAR A QUARREL IN A FAMILY WHICH IS EVER
TO BE REGARDED AS UNPATRIOTIC AND UNNATURAL AND OUGHT TO BE PROSECUTED
WITH A VIEW TO RECONCILIATION IN A TRUE PHIL HELLENIC SPIRIT AS OF
THOSE WHO WOULD CHASTEN BUT NOT UTTERLY ENSLAVE
THE WAR IS NOT AGAINST
A WHOLE NATION WHO ARE A FRIENDLY MULTITUDE OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN
BUT ONLY AGAINST A FEW GUILTY PERSONS WHEN THEY ARE PUNISHED PEACE WILL
BE RESTORED
THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH HELLENES SHOULD WAR AGAINST ONE
ANOTHER AND AGAINST BARBARIANS AS THEY WAR AGAINST ONE ANOTHER NOW
'BUT MY DEAR SOCRATES YOU ARE FORGETTING THE MAIN QUESTION IS SUCH A
STATE POSSIBLE I GRANT ALL AND MORE THAN YOU SAY ABOUT THE BLESSEDNESS
OF BEING ONE FAMILY FATHERS BROTHERS MOTHERS DAUGHTERS GOING OUT
TO WAR TOGETHER BUT I WANT TO ASCERTAIN THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS IDEAL
STATE YOU ARE TOO UNMERCIFUL
THE FIRST WAVE AND THE SECOND WAVE I
HAVE HARDLY ESCAPED AND NOW YOU WILL CERTAINLY DROWN ME WITH THE THIRD
WHEN YOU SEE THE TOWERING CREST OF THE WAVE I EXPECT YOU TO TAKE PITY
'NOT A WHIT
WELL THEN WE WERE LED TO FORM OUR IDEAL POLITY IN THE SEARCH AFTER
JUSTICE AND THE JUST MAN ANSWERED TO THE JUST STATE
IS THIS IDEAL AT
ALL THE WORSE FOR BEING IMPRACTICABLE WOULD THE PICTURE OF A PERFECTLY
BEAUTIFUL MAN BE ANY THE WORSE BECAUSE NO SUCH MAN EVER LIVED CAN ANY
REALITY COME UP TO THE IDEA NATURE WILL NOT ALLOW WORDS TO BE FULLY
REALIZED BUT IF I AM TO TRY AND REALIZE THE IDEAL OF THE STATE IN A
MEASURE I THINK THAT AN APPROACH MAY BE MADE TO THE PERFECTION OF WHICH
I DREAM BY ONE OR TWO I DO NOT SAY SLIGHT BUT POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE
PRESENT CONSTITUTION OF STATES
I WOULD REDUCE THEM TO A SINGLE ONE THE
GREAT WAVE AS I CALL IT
UNTIL THEN KINGS ARE PHILOSOPHERS OR
PHILOSOPHERS ARE KINGS CITIES WILL NEVER CEASE FROM ILL NO NOR THE
HUMAN RACE NOR WILL OUR IDEAL POLITY EVER COME INTO BEING
I KNOW THAT
THIS IS A HARD SAYING WHICH FEW WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE
'SOCRATES
ALL THE WORLD WILL TAKE OFF HIS COAT AND RUSH UPON YOU WITH STICKS AND
STONES AND THEREFORE I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO PREPARE AN ANSWER YOU GOT
ME INTO THE SCRAPE I SAID
'AND I WAS RIGHT HE REPLIED 'HOWEVER I
WILL STAND BY YOU AS A SORT OF DO NOTHING WELL MEANING ALLY HAVING
THE HELP OF SUCH A CHAMPION I WILL DO MY BEST TO MAINTAIN MY POSITION
AND FIRST I MUST EXPLAIN OF WHOM I SPEAK AND WHAT SORT OF NATURES THESE
ARE WHO ARE TO BE PHILOSOPHERS AND RULERS
AS YOU ARE A MAN OF PLEASURE
YOU WILL NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW INDISCRIMINATE LOVERS ARE IN THEIR
ATTACHMENTS THEY LOVE ALL AND TURN BLEMISHES INTO BEAUTIES
THE
SNUB NOSED YOUTH IS SAID TO HAVE A WINNING GRACE THE BEAK OF ANOTHER
HAS A ROYAL LOOK THE FEATURELESS ARE FAULTLESS THE DARK ARE MANLY THE
FAIR ANGELS THE SICKLY HAVE A NEW TERM OF ENDEARMENT INVENTED EXPRESSLY
FOR THEM WHICH IS 'HONEY PALE LOVERS OF WINE AND LOVERS OF AMBITION
ALSO DESIRE THE OBJECTS OF THEIR AFFECTION IN EVERY FORM
NOW HERE COMES
THE POINT THE PHILOSOPHER TOO IS A LOVER OF KNOWLEDGE IN EVERY FORM
HE HAS AN INSATIABLE CURIOSITY
'BUT WILL CURIOSITY MAKE A PHILOSOPHER
ARE THE LOVERS OF SIGHTS AND SOUNDS WHO LET OUT THEIR EARS TO EVERY
CHORUS AT THE DIONYSIAC FESTIVALS TO BE CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THEY
ARE NOT TRUE PHILOSOPHERS BUT ONLY AN IMITATION
'THEN HOW ARE WE TO
DESCRIBE THE TRUE
YOU WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE OF ABSTRACT IDEAS SUCH AS JUSTICE
BEAUTY GOOD EVIL WHICH ARE SEVERALLY ONE YET IN THEIR VARIOUS
COMBINATIONS APPEAR TO BE MANY
THOSE WHO RECOGNIZE THESE REALITIES ARE
PHILOSOPHERS WHEREAS THE OTHER CLASS HEAR SOUNDS AND SEE COLOURS
AND UNDERSTAND THEIR USE IN THE ARTS BUT CANNOT ATTAIN TO THE TRUE OR
WAKING VISION OF ABSOLUTE JUSTICE OR BEAUTY OR TRUTH THEY HAVE NOT THE
LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE BUT OF OPINION AND WHAT THEY SEE IS A DREAM ONLY
PERHAPS HE OF WHOM WE SAY THE LAST WILL BE ANGRY WITH US CAN WE PACIFY
HIM WITHOUT REVEALING THE DISORDER OF HIS MIND SUPPOSE WE SAY THAT
IF HE HAS KNOWLEDGE WE REJOICE TO HEAR IT BUT KNOWLEDGE MUST BE OF
SOMETHING WHICH IS AS IGNORANCE IS OF SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT AND THERE
IS A THIRD THING WHICH BOTH IS AND IS NOT AND IS MATTER OF OPINION
ONLY
OPINION AND KNOWLEDGE THEN HAVING DISTINCT OBJECTS MUST ALSO
BE DISTINCT FACULTIES
AND BY FACULTIES I MEAN POWERS UNSEEN AND
DISTINGUISHABLE ONLY BY THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR OBJECTS AS OPINION
AND KNOWLEDGE DIFFER SINCE THE ONE IS LIABLE TO ERR BUT THE OTHER
IS UNERRING AND IS THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL OUR FACULTIES
IF BEING IS
THE OBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE AND NOT BEING OF IGNORANCE AND THESE ARE THE
EXTREMES OPINION MUST LIE BETWEEN THEM AND MAY BE CALLED DARKER THAN
THE ONE AND BRIGHTER THAN THE OTHER
THIS INTERMEDIATE OR CONTINGENT
MATTER IS AND IS NOT AT THE SAME TIME AND PARTAKES BOTH OF EXISTENCE
AND OF NON EXISTENCE
NOW I WOULD ASK MY GOOD FRIEND WHO DENIES
ABSTRACT BEAUTY AND JUSTICE AND AFFIRMS A MANY BEAUTIFUL AND A
MANY JUST WHETHER EVERYTHING HE SEES IS NOT IN SOME POINT OF VIEW
DIFFERENT THE BEAUTIFUL UGLY THE PIOUS IMPIOUS THE JUST UNJUST IS
NOT THE DOUBLE ALSO THE HALF AND ARE NOT HEAVY AND LIGHT RELATIVE TERMS
WHICH PASS INTO ONE ANOTHER EVERYTHING IS AND IS NOT AS IN THE OLD
RIDDLE 'A MAN AND NOT A MAN SHOT AND DID NOT SHOOT A BIRD AND NOT A
BIRD WITH A STONE AND NOT A STONE THE MIND CANNOT BE FIXED ON EITHER
ALTERNATIVE AND THESE AMBIGUOUS INTERMEDIATE ERRING HALF LIGHTED
OBJECTS WHICH HAVE A DISORDERLY MOVEMENT IN THE REGION BETWEEN BEING
AND NOT BEING ARE THE PROPER MATTER OF OPINION AS THE IMMUTABLE
OBJECTS ARE THE PROPER MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE
AND HE WHO GROVELS IN THE
WORLD OF SENSE AND HAS ONLY THIS UNCERTAIN PERCEPTION OF THINGS IS NOT
A PHILOSOPHER BUT A LOVER OF OPINION ONLY
THE FIFTH BOOK IS THE NEW BEGINNING OF THE REPUBLIC IN WHICH THE
COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY AND OF FAMILY ARE FIRST MAINTAINED AND THE
TRANSITION IS MADE TO THE KINGDOM OF PHILOSOPHERS
FOR BOTH OF THESE
PLATO AFTER HIS MANNER HAS BEEN PREPARING IN SOME CHANCE WORDS OF BOOK
IV WHICH FALL UNPERCEIVED ON THE READER'S MIND AS THEY ARE SUPPOSED
AT FIRST TO HAVE FALLEN ON THE EAR OF GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS
THE
'PARADOXES AS MORGENSTERN TERMS THEM OF THIS BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC
WILL BE RESERVED FOR ANOTHER PLACE A FEW REMARKS ON THE STYLE AND SOME
EXPLANATIONS OF DIFFICULTIES MAY BE BRIEFLY ADDED
FIRST THERE IS THE IMAGE OF THE WAVES WHICH SERVES FOR A SORT OF
SCHEME OR PLAN OF THE BOOK
THE FIRST WAVE THE SECOND WAVE THE THIRD
AND GREATEST WAVE COME ROLLING IN AND WE HEAR THE ROAR OF THEM
ALL
THAT CAN BE SAID OF THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF PLATO'S PROPOSALS IS ANTICIPATED
BY HIMSELF
NOTHING IS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN THE HESITATION WITH WHICH HE
PROPOSES THE SOLEMN TEXT 'UNTIL KINGS ARE PHILOSOPHERS ETC OR THE
REACTION FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS WHEN GLAUCON DESCRIBES THE
MANNER IN WHICH THE NEW TRUTH WILL BE RECEIVED BY MANKIND
SOME DEFECTS AND DIFFICULTIES MAY BE NOTED IN THE EXECUTION OF THE
COMMUNISTIC PLAN
NOTHING IS TOLD US OF THE APPLICATION OF COMMUNISM
TO THE LOWER CLASSES NOR IS THE TABLE OF PROHIBITED DEGREES CAPABLE OF
BEING MADE OUT
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT A CHILD BORN AT ONE HYMENEAL
FESTIVAL MAY MARRY ONE OF ITS OWN BROTHERS OR SISTERS OR EVEN ONE OF
ITS PARENTS AT ANOTHER
PLATO IS AFRAID OF INCESTUOUS UNIONS BUT AT
THE SAME TIME HE DOES NOT WISH TO BRING BEFORE US THE FACT THAT THE CITY
WOULD BE DIVIDED INTO FAMILIES OF THOSE BORN SEVEN AND NINE MONTHS AFTER
EACH HYMENEAL FESTIVAL
IF IT WERE WORTH WHILE TO ARGUE SERIOUSLY ABOUT
SUCH FANCIES WE MIGHT REMARK THAT WHILE ALL THE OLD AFFINITIES ARE
ABOLISHED THE NEWLY PROHIBITED AFFINITY RESTS NOT ON ANY NATURAL OR
RATIONAL PRINCIPLE BUT ONLY UPON THE ACCIDENT OF CHILDREN HAVING BEEN
BORN IN THE SAME MONTH AND YEAR
NOR DOES HE EXPLAIN HOW THE LOTS COULD
BE SO MANIPULATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS TO BRING TOGETHER THE FAIREST
AND BEST
THE SINGULAR EXPRESSION WHICH IS EMPLOYED TO DESCRIBE THE AGE
OF FIVE AND TWENTY MAY PERHAPS BE TAKEN FROM SOME POET
IN THE DELINEATION OF THE PHILOSOPHER THE ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE NATURE
OF PHILOSOPHY DERIVED FROM LOVE ARE MORE SUITED TO THE APPREHENSION
OF GLAUCON THE ATHENIAN MAN OF PLEASURE THAN TO MODERN TASTES OR
FEELINGS
THEY ARE PARTLY FACETIOUS BUT ALSO CONTAIN A GERM OF TRUTH
THAT SCIENCE IS A WHOLE REMAINS A TRUE PRINCIPLE OF INDUCTIVE AS WELL
AS OF METAPHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE LOVE OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE IS
STILL THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PHILOSOPHER IN MODERN AS WELL AS IN
ANCIENT TIMES
AT THE END OF THE FIFTH BOOK PLATO INTRODUCES THE FIGMENT OF CONTINGENT
MATTER WHICH HAS EXERCISED SO GREAT AN INFLUENCE BOTH ON THE ETHICS AND
THEOLOGY OF THE MODERN WORLD AND WHICH OCCURS HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
HE DID NOT REMARK THAT THE DEGREES OF
KNOWLEDGE IN THE SUBJECT HAVE NOTHING CORRESPONDING TO THEM IN THE
OBJECT
WITH HIM A WORD MUST ANSWER TO AN IDEA AND HE COULD NOT
CONCEIVE OF AN OPINION WHICH WAS AN OPINION ABOUT NOTHING
THE INFLUENCE
OF ANALOGY LED HIM TO INVENT 'PARALLELS AND CONJUGATES' AND TO OVERLOOK
FACTS
TO US SOME OF HIS DIFFICULTIES ARE PUZZLING ONLY FROM THEIR
SIMPLICITY WE DO NOT PERCEIVE THAT THE ANSWER TO THEM 'IS TUMBLING OUT
AT OUR FEET TO THE MIND OF EARLY THINKERS THE CONCEPTION OF NOT BEING
WAS DARK AND MYSTERIOUS THEY DID NOT SEE THAT THIS TERRIBLE APPARITION
WHICH THREATENED DESTRUCTION TO ALL KNOWLEDGE WAS ONLY A LOGICAL
DETERMINATION
THE COMMON TERM UNDER WHICH THROUGH THE ACCIDENTAL USE
OF LANGUAGE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IDEAS WERE INCLUDED WAS ANOTHER
SOURCE OF CONFUSION
THUS THROUGH THE AMBIGUITY OF GREEK PLATO
ATTEMPTING TO INTRODUCE ORDER INTO THE FIRST CHAOS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
SEEMS TO HAVE CONFUSED PERCEPTION AND OPINION AND TO HAVE FAILED TO
DISTINGUISH THE CONTINGENT FROM THE RELATIVE
IN THE THEAETETUS THE
FIRST OF THESE DIFFICULTIES BEGINS TO CLEAR UP IN THE SOPHIST THE
SECOND AND FOR THIS AS WELL AS FOR OTHER REASONS BOTH THESE DIALOGUES
ARE PROBABLY TO BE REGARDED AS LATER THAN THE REPUBLIC
BOOK VI
HAVING DETERMINED THAT THE MANY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE
BEING AND HAVE NO CLEAR PATTERNS IN THEIR MINDS OF JUSTICE BEAUTY
TRUTH AND THAT PHILOSOPHERS HAVE SUCH PATTERNS WE HAVE NOW TO ASK
WHETHER THEY OR THE MANY SHALL BE RULERS IN OUR STATE
BUT WHO CAN DOUBT
THAT PHILOSOPHERS SHOULD BE CHOSEN IF THEY HAVE THE OTHER QUALITIES
WHICH ARE REQUIRED IN A RULER FOR THEY ARE LOVERS OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF
THE ETERNAL AND OF ALL TRUTH THEY ARE HATERS OF FALSEHOOD THEIR MEANER
DESIRES ARE ABSORBED IN THE INTERESTS OF KNOWLEDGE THEY ARE SPECTATORS
OF ALL TIME AND ALL EXISTENCE AND IN THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THEIR
CONTEMPLATION THE LIFE OF MAN IS AS NOTHING TO THEM NOR IS DEATH
FEARFUL
ALSO THEY ARE OF A SOCIAL GRACIOUS DISPOSITION EQUALLY FREE
FROM COWARDICE AND ARROGANCE
THEY LEARN AND REMEMBER EASILY THEY HAVE
HARMONIOUS WELL REGULATED MINDS TRUTH FLOWS TO THEM SWEETLY BY NATURE
CAN THE GOD OF JEALOUSY HIMSELF FIND ANY FAULT WITH SUCH AN ASSEMBLAGE
OF GOOD QUALITIES
HERE ADEIMANTUS INTERPOSES 'NO MAN CAN ANSWER YOU SOCRATES BUT EVERY
MAN FEELS THAT THIS IS OWING TO HIS OWN DEFICIENCY IN ARGUMENT
HE IS
DRIVEN FROM ONE POSITION TO ANOTHER UNTIL HE HAS NOTHING MORE TO SAY
JUST AS AN UNSKILFUL PLAYER AT DRAUGHTS IS REDUCED TO HIS LAST MOVE BY
A MORE SKILLED OPPONENT
AND YET ALL THE TIME HE MAY BE RIGHT
HE MAY
KNOW IN THIS VERY INSTANCE THAT THOSE WHO MAKE PHILOSOPHY THE BUSINESS
OF THEIR LIVES GENERALLY TURN OUT ROGUES IF THEY ARE BAD MEN AND FOOLS
IF THEY ARE GOOD
WHAT DO YOU SAY I SHOULD SAY THAT HE IS QUITE RIGHT
'THEN HOW IS SUCH AN ADMISSION RECONCILEABLE WITH THE DOCTRINE THAT
PHILOSOPHERS SHOULD BE KINGS
I SHALL ANSWER YOU IN A PARABLE WHICH WILL ALSO LET YOU SEE HOW POOR A
HAND I AM AT THE INVENTION OF ALLEGORIES
THE RELATION OF GOOD MEN TO
THEIR GOVERNMENTS IS SO PECULIAR THAT IN ORDER TO DEFEND THEM I MUST
TAKE AN ILLUSTRATION FROM THE WORLD OF FICTION
CONCEIVE THE CAPTAIN
OF A SHIP TALLER BY A HEAD AND SHOULDERS THAN ANY OF THE CREW YET A
LITTLE DEAF A LITTLE BLIND AND RATHER IGNORANT OF THE SEAMAN'S ART
THE SAILORS WANT TO STEER ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THE ART AND
THEY HAVE A THEORY THAT IT CANNOT BE LEARNED
IF THE HELM IS REFUSED
THEM THEY DRUG THE CAPTAIN'S POSSET BIND HIM HAND AND FOOT AND TAKE
POSSESSION OF THE SHIP
HE WHO JOINS IN THE MUTINY IS TERMED A GOOD
PILOT AND WHAT NOT THEY HAVE NO CONCEPTION THAT THE TRUE PILOT MUST
OBSERVE THE WINDS AND THE STARS AND MUST BE THEIR MASTER WHETHER
THEY LIKE IT OR NOT SUCH AN ONE WOULD BE CALLED BY THEM FOOL PRATER
STAR GAZER
THIS IS MY PARABLE WHICH I WILL BEG YOU TO INTERPRET FOR
ME TO THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO ASK WHY THE PHILOSOPHER HAS SUCH AN EVIL NAME
AND TO EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT NOT HE BUT THOSE WHO WILL NOT USE HIM ARE
TO BLAME FOR HIS USELESSNESS
THE PHILOSOPHER SHOULD NOT BEG OF MANKIND
TO BE PUT IN AUTHORITY OVER THEM
THE WISE MAN SHOULD NOT SEEK THE RICH
AS THE PROVERB BIDS BUT EVERY MAN WHETHER RICH OR POOR MUST KNOCK AT
THE DOOR OF THE PHYSICIAN WHEN HE HAS NEED OF HIM
NOW THE PILOT IS
THE PHILOSOPHER HE WHOM IN THE PARABLE THEY CALL STAR GAZER AND THE
MUTINOUS SAILORS ARE THE MOB OF POLITICIANS BY WHOM HE IS RENDERED
USELESS
NOT THAT THESE ARE THE WORST ENEMIES OF PHILOSOPHY WHO IS FAR
MORE DISHONOURED BY HER OWN PROFESSING SONS WHEN THEY ARE CORRUPTED BY
THE WORLD
NEED I RECALL THE ORIGINAL IMAGE OF THE PHILOSOPHER DID WE
NOT SAY OF HIM JUST NOW THAT HE LOVED TRUTH AND HATED FALSEHOOD AND
THAT HE COULD NOT REST IN THE MULTIPLICITY OF PHENOMENA BUT WAS LED BY
A SYMPATHY IN HIS OWN NATURE TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE ABSOLUTE ALL
THE VIRTUES AS WELL AS TRUTH WHO IS THE LEADER OF THEM TOOK UP THEIR
ABODE IN HIS SOUL
BUT AS YOU WERE OBSERVING IF WE TURN ASIDE TO VIEW
THE REALITY WE SEE THAT THE PERSONS WHO WERE THUS DESCRIBED WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF A SMALL AND USELESS CLASS ARE UTTER ROGUES
THE POINT WHICH HAS TO BE CONSIDERED IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS CORRUPTION
IN NATURE
EVERY ONE WILL ADMIT THAT THE PHILOSOPHER IN OUR DESCRIPTION
OF HIM IS A RARE BEING
BUT WHAT NUMBERLESS CAUSES TEND TO DESTROY
THESE RARE BEINGS THERE IS NO GOOD THING WHICH MAY NOT BE A CAUSE OF
EVIL HEALTH WEALTH STRENGTH RANK AND THE VIRTUES THEMSELVES
WHEN PLACED UNDER UNFAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
FOR AS IN THE ANIMAL OR
VEGETABLE WORLD THE STRONGEST SEEDS MOST NEED THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF GOOD
AIR AND SOIL SO THE BEST OF HUMAN CHARACTERS TURN OUT THE WORST WHEN
THEY FALL UPON AN UNSUITABLE SOIL WHEREAS WEAK NATURES HARDLY EVER
DO ANY CONSIDERABLE GOOD OR HARM THEY ARE NOT THE STUFF OUT OF WHICH
EITHER GREAT CRIMINALS OR GREAT HEROES ARE MADE
THE PHILOSOPHER FOLLOWS
THE SAME ANALOGY HE IS EITHER THE BEST OR THE WORST OF ALL MEN
SOME
PERSONS SAY THAT THE SOPHISTS ARE THE CORRUPTERS OF YOUTH BUT IS NOT
PUBLIC OPINION THE REAL SOPHIST WHO IS EVERYWHERE PRESENT IN THOSE VERY
PERSONS IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE COURTS IN THE CAMP IN THE APPLAUSES
AND HISSES OF THE THEATRE RE ECHOED BY THE SURROUNDING HILLS WILL NOT
A YOUNG MAN'S HEART LEAP AMID THESE DISCORDANT SOUNDS AND WILL ANY
EDUCATION SAVE HIM FROM BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE TORRENT NOR IS THIS
ALL
FOR IF HE WILL NOT YIELD TO OPINION THERE FOLLOWS THE GENTLE
COMPULSION OF EXILE OR DEATH
WHAT PRINCIPLE OF RIVAL SOPHISTS OR
ANYBODY ELSE CAN OVERCOME IN SUCH AN UNEQUAL CONTEST CHARACTERS THERE
MAY BE MORE THAN HUMAN WHO ARE EXCEPTIONS GOD MAY SAVE A MAN BUT NOT
HIS OWN STRENGTH
FURTHER I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER THAT THE HIRELING
SOPHIST ONLY GIVES BACK TO THE WORLD THEIR OWN OPINIONS HE IS THE
KEEPER OF THE MONSTER WHO KNOWS HOW TO FLATTER OR ANGER HIM AND
OBSERVES THE MEANING OF HIS INARTICULATE GRUNTS
GOOD IS WHAT PLEASES
HIM EVIL WHAT HE DISLIKES TRUTH AND BEAUTY ARE DETERMINED ONLY BY
THE TASTE OF THE BRUTE
SUCH IS THE SOPHIST'S WISDOM AND SUCH IS THE
CONDITION OF THOSE WHO MAKE PUBLIC OPINION THE TEST OF TRUTH WHETHER IN
ART OR IN MORALS
THE CURSE IS LAID UPON THEM OF BEING AND DOING WHAT
IT APPROVES AND WHEN THEY ATTEMPT FIRST PRINCIPLES THE FAILURE IS
LUDICROUS
THINK OF ALL THIS AND ASK YOURSELF WHETHER THE WORLD IS MORE
LIKELY TO BE A BELIEVER IN THE UNITY OF THE IDEA OR IN THE MULTIPLICITY
OF PHENOMENA
AND THE WORLD IF NOT A BELIEVER IN THE IDEA CANNOT BE A
PHILOSOPHER AND MUST THEREFORE BE A PERSECUTOR OF PHILOSOPHERS
THERE
IS ANOTHER EVIL THE WORLD DOES NOT LIKE TO LOSE THE GIFTED NATURE AND
SO THEY FLATTER THE YOUNG ALCIBIADES INTO A MAGNIFICENT OPINION OF HIS
OWN CAPACITY THE TALL PROPER YOUTH BEGINS TO EXPAND AND IS DREAMING
OF KINGDOMS AND EMPIRES
IF AT THIS INSTANT A FRIEND WHISPERS TO
HIM 'NOW THE GODS LIGHTEN THEE THOU ART A GREAT FOOL' AND MUST BE
EDUCATED DO YOU THINK THAT HE WILL LISTEN OR SUPPOSE A BETTER SORT OF
MAN WHO IS ATTRACTED TOWARDS PHILOSOPHY WILL THEY NOT MAKE HERCULEAN
EFFORTS TO SPOIL AND CORRUPT HIM ARE WE NOT RIGHT IN SAYING THAT THE
LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE NO LESS THAN RICHES MAY DIVERT HIM MEN OF THIS
CLASS CRITIAS OFTEN BECOME POLITICIANS THEY ARE THE AUTHORS OF
GREAT MISCHIEF IN STATES AND SOMETIMES ALSO OF GREAT GOOD
AND THUS
PHILOSOPHY IS DESERTED BY HER NATURAL PROTECTORS AND OTHERS ENTER IN
AND DISHONOUR HER
VULGAR LITTLE MINDS SEE THE LAND OPEN AND RUSH FROM
THE PRISONS OF THE ARTS INTO HER TEMPLE
A CLEVER MECHANIC HAVING A
SOUL COARSE AS HIS BODY THINKS THAT HE WILL GAIN CASTE BY BECOMING HER
SUITOR
FOR PHILOSOPHY EVEN IN HER FALLEN ESTATE HAS A DIGNITY OF HER
OWN AND HE LIKE A BALD LITTLE BLACKSMITH'S APPRENTICE AS HE IS HAVING
MADE SOME MONEY AND GOT OUT OF DURANCE WASHES AND DRESSES HIMSELF AS A
BRIDEGROOM AND MARRIES HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER
WHAT WILL BE THE ISSUE OF
SUCH MARRIAGES WILL THEY NOT BE VILE AND BASTARD DEVOID OF TRUTH
AND NATURE 'THEY WILL SMALL THEN IS THE REMNANT OF GENUINE
PHILOSOPHERS THERE MAY BE A FEW WHO ARE CITIZENS OF SMALL STATES IN
WHICH POLITICS ARE NOT WORTH THINKING OF OR WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY
THEAGES' BRIDLE OF ILL HEALTH FOR MY OWN CASE OF THE ORACULAR SIGN IS
ALMOST UNIQUE AND TOO RARE TO BE WORTH MENTIONING
AND THESE FEW WHEN
THEY HAVE TASTED THE PLEASURES OF PHILOSOPHY AND HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT
THAT DEN OF THIEVES AND PLACE OF WILD BEASTS WHICH IS HUMAN LIFE
WILL STAND ASIDE FROM THE STORM UNDER THE SHELTER OF A WALL AND TRY TO
PRESERVE THEIR OWN INNOCENCE AND TO DEPART IN PEACE
'A GREAT WORK TOO
WILL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY THEM GREAT YES BUT NOT THE GREATEST
FOR MAN IS A SOCIAL BEING AND CAN ONLY ATTAIN HIS HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT
IN THE SOCIETY WHICH IS BEST SUITED TO HIM
ENOUGH THEN OF THE CAUSES WHY PHILOSOPHY HAS SUCH AN EVIL NAME
ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHICH OF EXISTING STATES IS SUITED TO HER NOT ONE
OF THEM AT PRESENT SHE IS LIKE SOME EXOTIC SEED WHICH DEGENERATES IN
A STRANGE SOIL ONLY IN HER PROPER STATE WILL SHE BE SHOWN TO BE OF
HEAVENLY GROWTH
'AND IS HER PROPER STATE OURS OR SOME OTHER OURS IN
ALL POINTS BUT ONE WHICH WAS LEFT UNDETERMINED
YOU MAY REMEMBER OUR
SAYING THAT SOME LIVING MIND OR WITNESS OF THE LEGISLATOR WAS NEEDED IN
STATES
BUT WE WERE AFRAID TO ENTER UPON A SUBJECT OF SUCH DIFFICULTY
AND NOW THE QUESTION RECURS AND HAS NOT GROWN EASIER HOW MAY
PHILOSOPHY BE SAFELY STUDIED LET US BRING HER INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY
AND MAKE AN END OF THE INQUIRY
IN THE FIRST PLACE I SAY BOLDLY THAT NOTHING CAN BE WORSE THAN THE
PRESENT MODE OF STUDY
PERSONS USUALLY PICK UP A LITTLE PHILOSOPHY IN
EARLY YOUTH AND IN THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS BUT THEY NEVER MASTER THE
REAL DIFFICULTY WHICH IS DIALECTIC
LATER PERHAPS THEY OCCASIONALLY
GO TO A LECTURE ON PHILOSOPHY
YEARS ADVANCE AND THE SUN OF PHILOSOPHY
UNLIKE THAT OF HERACLEITUS SETS NEVER TO RISE AGAIN
THIS ORDER OF
EDUCATION SHOULD BE REVERSED IT SHOULD BEGIN WITH GYMNASTICS IN YOUTH
AND AS THE MAN STRENGTHENS HE SHOULD INCREASE THE GYMNASTICS OF
HIS SOUL
THEN WHEN ACTIVE LIFE IS OVER LET HIM FINALLY RETURN TO
PHILOSOPHY
'YOU ARE IN EARNEST SOCRATES BUT THE WORLD WILL BE EQUALLY
EARNEST IN WITHSTANDING YOU NO MORE THAN THRASYMACHUS DO NOT MAKE A
QUARREL BETWEEN THRASYMACHUS AND ME WHO WERE NEVER ENEMIES AND ARE
NOW GOOD FRIENDS ENOUGH
AND I SHALL DO MY BEST TO CONVINCE HIM AND
ALL MANKIND OF THE TRUTH OF MY WORDS OR AT ANY RATE TO PREPARE FOR
THE FUTURE WHEN IN ANOTHER LIFE WE MAY AGAIN TAKE PART IN SIMILAR
DISCUSSIONS
'THAT WILL BE A LONG TIME HENCE NOT LONG IN COMPARISON
WITH ETERNITY
THE MANY WILL PROBABLY REMAIN INCREDULOUS FOR THEY
HAVE NEVER SEEN THE NATURAL UNITY OF IDEAS BUT ONLY ARTIFICIAL
JUXTAPOSITIONS NOT FREE AND GENEROUS THOUGHTS BUT TRICKS OF
CONTROVERSY AND QUIPS OF LAW A PERFECT MAN RULING IN A PERFECT STATE
EVEN A SINGLE ONE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN
AND WE FORESAW THAT THERE WAS NO
CHANCE OF PERFECTION EITHER IN STATES OR INDIVIDUALS UNTIL A NECESSITY
WAS LAID UPON PHILOSOPHERS NOT THE ROGUES BUT THOSE WHOM WE CALLED
THE USELESS CLASS OF HOLDING OFFICE OR UNTIL THE SONS OF KINGS WERE
INSPIRED WITH A TRUE LOVE OF PHILOSOPHY
WHETHER IN THE INFINITY OF
PAST TIME THERE HAS BEEN OR IS IN SOME DISTANT LAND OR EVER WILL BE
HEREAFTER AN IDEAL SUCH AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED WE STOUTLY MAINTAIN
THAT THERE HAS BEEN IS AND WILL BE SUCH A STATE WHENEVER THE MUSE OF
PHILOSOPHY RULES
WILL YOU SAY THAT THE WORLD IS OF ANOTHER MIND O MY
FRIEND DO NOT REVILE THE WORLD THEY WILL SOON CHANGE THEIR OPINION
IF THEY ARE GENTLY ENTREATED AND ARE TAUGHT THE TRUE NATURE OF THE
PHILOSOPHER
WHO CAN HATE A MAN WHO LOVES HIM OR BE JEALOUS OF ONE WHO
HAS NO JEALOUSY CONSIDER AGAIN THAT THE MANY HATE NOT THE TRUE BUT
THE FALSE PHILOSOPHERS THE PRETENDERS WHO FORCE THEIR WAY IN WITHOUT
INVITATION AND ARE ALWAYS SPEAKING OF PERSONS AND NOT OF PRINCIPLES
WHICH IS UNLIKE THE SPIRIT OF PHILOSOPHY
FOR THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER
DESPISES EARTHLY STRIFE HIS EYE IS FIXED ON THE ETERNAL ORDER IN
ACCORDANCE WITH WHICH HE MOULDS HIMSELF INTO THE DIVINE IMAGE AND NOT
HIMSELF ONLY BUT OTHER MEN AND IS THE CREATOR OF THE VIRTUES PRIVATE
AS WELL AS PUBLIC
WHEN MANKIND SEE THAT THE HAPPINESS OF STATES IS ONLY
TO BE FOUND IN THAT IMAGE WILL THEY BE ANGRY WITH US FOR ATTEMPTING
TO DELINEATE IT 'CERTAINLY NOT
BUT WHAT WILL BE THE PROCESS OF
DELINEATION THE ARTIST WILL DO NOTHING UNTIL HE HAS MADE A TABULA
RASA ON THIS HE WILL INSCRIBE THE CONSTITUTION OF A STATE GLANCING
OFTEN AT THE DIVINE TRUTH OF NATURE AND FROM THAT DERIVING THE GODLIKE
AMONG MEN MINGLING THE TWO ELEMENTS RUBBING OUT AND PAINTING IN
UNTIL THERE IS A PERFECT HARMONY OR FUSION OF THE DIVINE AND HUMAN
BUT
PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH AN ARTIST
WHAT WILL
THEY DOUBT THAT THE PHILOSOPHER IS A LOVER OF TRUTH HAVING A NATURE
AKIN TO THE BEST AND IF THEY ADMIT THIS WILL THEY STILL QUARREL WITH
US FOR MAKING PHILOSOPHERS OUR KINGS 'THEY WILL BE LESS DISPOSED TO
QUARREL LET US ASSUME THEN THAT THEY ARE PACIFIED
STILL A PERSON MAY
HESITATE ABOUT THE PROBABILITY OF THE SON OF A KING BEING A PHILOSOPHER
AND WE DO NOT DENY THAT THEY ARE VERY LIABLE TO BE CORRUPTED BUT YET
SURELY IN THE COURSE OF AGES THERE MIGHT BE ONE EXCEPTION AND ONE
IS ENOUGH
IF ONE SON OF A KING WERE A PHILOSOPHER AND HAD OBEDIENT
CITIZENS HE MIGHT BRING THE IDEAL POLITY INTO BEING
HENCE WE CONCLUDE
THAT OUR LAWS ARE NOT ONLY THE BEST BUT THAT THEY ARE ALSO POSSIBLE
THOUGH NOT FREE FROM DIFFICULTY
I GAINED NOTHING BY EVADING THE TROUBLESOME QUESTIONS WHICH AROSE
CONCERNING WOMEN AND CHILDREN
I WILL BE WISER NOW AND ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT WE MUST GO TO THE BOTTOM OF ANOTHER QUESTION WHAT IS TO BE THE
EDUCATION OF OUR GUARDIANS IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY WERE TO BE LOVERS OF
THEIR COUNTRY AND WERE TO BE TESTED IN THE REFINER'S FIRE OF PLEASURES
AND PAINS AND THOSE WHO CAME FORTH PURE AND REMAINED FIXED IN THEIR
PRINCIPLES WERE TO HAVE HONOURS AND REWARDS IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH
BUT AT THIS POINT THE ARGUMENT PUT ON HER VEIL AND TURNED INTO ANOTHER
PATH
I HESITATED TO MAKE THE ASSERTION WHICH I NOW HAZARD THAT OUR
GUARDIANS MUST BE PHILOSOPHERS
YOU REMEMBER ALL THE CONTRADICTORY
ELEMENTS WHICH MET IN THE PHILOSOPHER HOW DIFFICULT TO FIND THEM ALL
IN A SINGLE PERSON INTELLIGENCE AND SPIRIT ARE NOT OFTEN COMBINED WITH
STEADINESS THE STOLID FEARLESS NATURE IS AVERSE TO INTELLECTUAL TOIL
AND YET THESE OPPOSITE ELEMENTS ARE ALL NECESSARY AND THEREFORE AS
WE WERE SAYING BEFORE THE ASPIRANT MUST BE TESTED IN PLEASURES AND
DANGERS AND ALSO AS WE MUST NOW FURTHER ADD IN THE HIGHEST BRANCHES
OF KNOWLEDGE
YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WHEN WE SPOKE OF THE VIRTUES
MENTION WAS MADE OF A LONGER ROAD WHICH YOU WERE SATISFIED TO LEAVE
UNEXPLORED
'ENOUGH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SAID ENOUGH MY FRIEND BUT
WHAT IS ENOUGH WHILE ANYTHING REMAINS WANTING OF ALL MEN THE GUARDIAN
MUST NOT FAINT IN THE SEARCH AFTER TRUTH HE MUST BE PREPARED TO TAKE
THE LONGER ROAD OR HE WILL NEVER REACH THAT HIGHER REGION WHICH IS
ABOVE THE FOUR VIRTUES AND OF THE VIRTUES TOO HE MUST NOT ONLY GET AN
OUTLINE BUT A CLEAR AND DISTINCT VISION
STRANGE THAT WE SHOULD BE SO
PRECISE ABOUT TRIFLES SO CARELESS ABOUT THE HIGHEST TRUTHS 'AND WHAT
ARE THE HIGHEST YOU TO PRETEND UNCONSCIOUSNESS WHEN YOU HAVE SO OFTEN
HEARD ME SPEAK OF THE IDEA OF GOOD ABOUT WHICH WE KNOW SO LITTLE AND
WITHOUT WHICH THOUGH A MAN GAIN THE WORLD HE HAS NO PROFIT OF IT SOME
PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT THE GOOD IS WISDOM BUT THIS INVOLVES A CIRCLE THE
GOOD THEY SAY IS WISDOM WISDOM HAS TO DO WITH THE GOOD
ACCORDING TO
OTHERS THE GOOD IS PLEASURE BUT THEN COMES THE ABSURDITY THAT GOOD IS
BAD FOR THERE ARE BAD PLEASURES AS WELL AS GOOD
AGAIN THE GOOD MUST
HAVE REALITY A MAN MAY DESIRE THE APPEARANCE OF VIRTUE BUT HE WILL NOT
DESIRE THE APPEARANCE OF GOOD
OUGHT OUR GUARDIANS THEN TO BE IGNORANT
OF THIS SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF WHICH EVERY MAN HAS A PRESENTIMENT AND
WITHOUT WHICH NO MAN HAS ANY REAL KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING 'BUT SOCRATES
WHAT IS THIS SUPREME PRINCIPLE KNOWLEDGE OR PLEASURE OR WHAT YOU MAY
THINK ME TROUBLESOME BUT I SAY THAT YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS TO BE ALWAYS
REPEATING THE DOCTRINES OF OTHERS INSTEAD OF GIVING US YOUR OWN CAN
I SAY WHAT I DO NOT KNOW 'YOU MAY OFFER AN OPINION AND WILL THE
BLINDNESS AND CROOKEDNESS OF OPINION CONTENT YOU WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE
THE LIGHT AND CERTAINTY OF SCIENCE 'I WILL ONLY ASK YOU TO GIVE SUCH
AN EXPLANATION OF THE GOOD AS YOU HAVE GIVEN ALREADY OF TEMPERANCE AND
JUSTICE I WISH THAT I COULD BUT IN MY PRESENT MOOD I CANNOT REACH TO
THE HEIGHT OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOOD
TO THE PARENT OR PRINCIPAL I
CANNOT INTRODUCE YOU BUT TO THE CHILD BEGOTTEN IN HIS IMAGE WHICH
I MAY COMPARE WITH THE INTEREST ON THE PRINCIPAL I WILL
AUDIT THE
ACCOUNT AND DO NOT LET ME GIVE YOU A FALSE STATEMENT OF THE DEBT
YOU REMEMBER OUR OLD DISTINCTION OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL AND THE ONE
BEAUTIFUL THE PARTICULAR AND THE UNIVERSAL THE OBJECTS OF SIGHT AND
THE OBJECTS OF THOUGHT DID YOU EVER CONSIDER THAT THE OBJECTS OF SIGHT
IMPLY A FACULTY OF SIGHT WHICH IS THE MOST COMPLEX AND COSTLY OF OUR
SENSES REQUIRING NOT ONLY OBJECTS OF SENSE BUT ALSO A MEDIUM WHICH IS
LIGHT WITHOUT WHICH THE SIGHT WILL NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN COLOURS AND
ALL WILL BE A BLANK FOR LIGHT IS THE NOBLE BOND BETWEEN THE PERCEIVING
FACULTY AND THE THING PERCEIVED AND THE GOD WHO GIVES US LIGHT IS THE
SUN WHO IS THE EYE OF THE DAY BUT IS NOT TO BE CONFOUNDED WITH THE EYE
OF MAN
THIS EYE OF THE DAY OR SUN IS WHAT I CALL THE CHILD OF THE GOOD
STANDING IN THE SAME RELATION TO THE VISIBLE WORLD AS THE GOOD TO THE
INTELLECTUAL
WHEN THE SUN SHINES THE EYE SEES AND IN THE INTELLECTUAL
WORLD WHERE TRUTH IS THERE IS SIGHT AND LIGHT
NOW THAT WHICH IS THE
SUN OF INTELLIGENT NATURES IS THE IDEA OF GOOD THE CAUSE OF KNOWLEDGE
AND TRUTH YET OTHER AND FAIRER THAN THEY ARE AND STANDING IN THE
SAME RELATION TO THEM IN WHICH THE SUN STANDS TO LIGHT
O INCONCEIVABLE
HEIGHT OF BEAUTY WHICH IS ABOVE KNOWLEDGE AND ABOVE TRUTH 'YOU CANNOT
SURELY MEAN PLEASURE HE SAID
PEACE I REPLIED AND THIS IDEA OF
GOOD LIKE THE SUN IS ALSO THE CAUSE OF GROWTH AND THE AUTHOR NOT OF
KNOWLEDGE ONLY BUT OF BEING YET GREATER FAR THAN EITHER IN DIGNITY
AND POWER
'THAT IS A REACH OF THOUGHT MORE THAN HUMAN BUT PRAY GO
ON WITH THE IMAGE FOR I SUSPECT THAT THERE IS MORE BEHIND THERE IS
I SAID AND BEARING IN MIND OUR TWO SUNS OR PRINCIPLES IMAGINE FURTHER
THEIR CORRESPONDING WORLDS ONE OF THE VISIBLE THE OTHER OF THE
INTELLIGIBLE YOU MAY ASSIST YOUR FANCY BY FIGURING THE DISTINCTION
UNDER THE IMAGE OF A LINE DIVIDED INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS AND MAY AGAIN
SUBDIVIDE EACH PART INTO TWO LESSER SEGMENTS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
STAGES OF KNOWLEDGE IN EITHER SPHERE
THE LOWER PORTION OF THE LOWER OR
VISIBLE SPHERE WILL CONSIST OF SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS AND ITS UPPER
AND SMALLER PORTION WILL CONTAIN REAL OBJECTS IN THE WORLD OF NATURE
OR OF ART
THE SPHERE OF THE INTELLIGIBLE WILL ALSO HAVE TWO
DIVISIONS ONE OF MATHEMATICS IN WHICH THERE IS NO ASCENT BUT ALL IS
DESCENT NO INQUIRING INTO PREMISES BUT ONLY DRAWING OF INFERENCES
IN THIS DIVISION THE MIND WORKS WITH FIGURES AND NUMBERS THE IMAGES OF
WHICH ARE TAKEN NOT FROM THE SHADOWS BUT FROM THE OBJECTS ALTHOUGH
THE TRUTH OF THEM IS SEEN ONLY WITH THE MIND'S EYE AND THEY ARE USED AS
HYPOTHESES WITHOUT BEING ANALYSED
WHEREAS IN THE OTHER DIVISION REASON
USES THE HYPOTHESES AS STAGES OR STEPS IN THE ASCENT TO THE IDEA OF
GOOD TO WHICH SHE FASTENS THEM AND THEN AGAIN DESCENDS WALKING FIRMLY
IN THE REGION OF IDEAS AND OF IDEAS ONLY IN HER ASCENT AS WELL AS
DESCENT AND FINALLY RESTING IN THEM
'I PARTLY UNDERSTAND HE REPLIED
'YOU MEAN THAT THE IDEAS OF SCIENCE ARE SUPERIOR TO THE HYPOTHETICAL
METAPHORICAL CONCEPTIONS OF GEOMETRY AND THE OTHER ARTS OR SCIENCES
WHICHEVER IS TO BE THE NAME OF THEM AND THE LATTER CONCEPTIONS YOU
REFUSE TO MAKE SUBJECTS OF PURE INTELLECT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO FIRST
PRINCIPLE ALTHOUGH WHEN RESTING ON A FIRST PRINCIPLE THEY PASS INTO
THE HIGHER SPHERE YOU UNDERSTAND ME VERY WELL I SAID
AND NOW TO
THOSE FOUR DIVISIONS OF KNOWLEDGE YOU MAY ASSIGN FOUR CORRESPONDING
FACULTIES PURE INTELLIGENCE TO THE HIGHEST SPHERE ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE
TO THE SECOND TO THE THIRD FAITH TO THE FOURTH THE PERCEPTION OF
SHADOWS AND THE CLEARNESS OF THE SEVERAL FACULTIES WILL BE IN THE SAME
RATIO AS THE TRUTH OF THE OBJECTS TO WHICH THEY ARE RELATED
LIKE SOCRATES WE MAY RECAPITULATE THE VIRTUES OF THE PHILOSOPHER
IN LANGUAGE WHICH SEEMS TO REACH BEYOND THE HORIZON OF THAT AGE
AND COUNTRY HE IS DESCRIBED AS 'THE SPECTATOR OF ALL TIME AND ALL
EXISTENCE HE HAS THE NOBLEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND MAKES THE HIGHEST
USE OF THEM
ALL HIS DESIRES ARE ABSORBED IN THE LOVE OF WISDOM WHICH
IS THE LOVE OF TRUTH
NONE OF THE GRACES OF A BEAUTIFUL SOUL ARE WANTING
IN HIM NEITHER CAN HE FEAR DEATH OR THINK MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE
THE
IDEAL OF MODERN TIMES HARDLY RETAINS THE SIMPLICITY OF THE ANTIQUE
THERE IS NOT THE SAME ORIGINALITY EITHER IN TRUTH OR ERROR WHICH
CHARACTERIZED THE GREEKS
THE PHILOSOPHER IS NO LONGER LIVING IN THE
UNSEEN NOR IS HE SENT BY AN ORACLE TO CONVINCE MANKIND OF IGNORANCE
NOR DOES HE REGARD KNOWLEDGE AS A SYSTEM OF IDEAS LEADING UPWARDS BY
REGULAR STAGES TO THE IDEA OF GOOD
THE EAGERNESS OF THE PURSUIT HAS
ABATED THERE IS MORE DIVISION OF LABOUR AND LESS OF COMPREHENSIVE
REFLECTION UPON NATURE AND HUMAN LIFE AS A WHOLE MORE OF EXACT
OBSERVATION AND LESS OF ANTICIPATION AND INSPIRATION
STILL IN THE
ALTERED CONDITIONS OF KNOWLEDGE THE PARALLEL IS NOT WHOLLY LOST AND
THERE MAY BE A USE IN TRANSLATING THE CONCEPTION OF PLATO INTO THE
LANGUAGE OF OUR OWN AGE
THE PHILOSOPHER IN MODERN TIMES IS ONE WHO
FIXES HIS MIND ON THE LAWS OF NATURE IN THEIR SEQUENCE AND CONNEXION
NOT ON FRAGMENTS OR PICTURES OF NATURE ON HISTORY NOT ON CONTROVERSY
ON THE TRUTHS WHICH ARE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE FEW NOT ON THE OPINIONS
OF THE MANY
HE IS AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF 'CLASSIFYING ACCORDING TO
NATURE AND WILL TRY TO 'SEPARATE THE LIMBS OF SCIENCE WITHOUT BREAKING
THEM' PHAEDR
THERE IS NO PART OF TRUTH WHETHER GREAT OR SMALL
WHICH HE WILL DISHONOUR AND IN THE LEAST THINGS HE WILL DISCERN THE
GREATEST PARMEN
LIKE THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER HE SEES THE WORLD
PERVADED BY ANALOGIES BUT HE CAN ALSO TELL 'WHY IN SOME CASES A SINGLE
INSTANCE IS SUFFICIENT FOR AN INDUCTION' MILL'S LOGIC WHILE IN
OTHER CASES A THOUSAND EXAMPLES WOULD PROVE NOTHING
HE INQUIRES INTO
A PORTION OF KNOWLEDGE ONLY BECAUSE THE WHOLE HAS GROWN TOO VAST TO BE
EMBRACED BY A SINGLE MIND OR LIFE
HE HAS A CLEARER CONCEPTION OF THE
DIVISIONS OF SCIENCE AND OF THEIR RELATION TO THE MIND OF MAN THAN WAS
POSSIBLE TO THE ANCIENTS
LIKE PLATO HE HAS A VISION OF THE UNITY OF
KNOWLEDGE NOT AS THE BEGINNING OF PHILOSOPHY TO BE ATTAINED BY A STUDY
OF ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS BUT AS THE FAR OFF RESULT OF THE WORKING
OF MANY MINDS IN MANY AGES
HE IS AWARE THAT MATHEMATICAL STUDIES ARE
PRELIMINARY TO ALMOST EVERY OTHER AT THE SAME TIME HE WILL NOT REDUCE
ALL VARIETIES OF KNOWLEDGE TO THE TYPE OF MATHEMATICS
HE TOO MUST HAVE
A NOBILITY OF CHARACTER WITHOUT WHICH GENIUS LOSES THE BETTER HALF
OF GREATNESS
REGARDING THE WORLD AS A POINT IN IMMENSITY AND EACH
INDIVIDUAL AS A LINK IN A NEVER ENDING CHAIN OF EXISTENCE HE WILL NOT
THINK MUCH OF HIS OWN LIFE OR BE GREATLY AFRAID OF DEATH
ADEIMANTUS OBJECTS FIRST OF ALL TO THE FORM OF THE SOCRATIC REASONING
THUS SHOWING THAT PLATO IS AWARE OF THE IMPERFECTION OF HIS OWN METHOD
HE BRINGS THE ACCUSATION AGAINST HIMSELF WHICH MIGHT BE BROUGHT AGAINST
HIM BY A MODERN LOGICIAN THAT HE EXTRACTS THE ANSWER BECAUSE HE KNOWS
HOW TO PUT THE QUESTION
IN A LONG ARGUMENT WORDS ARE APT TO CHANGE
THEIR MEANING SLIGHTLY OR PREMISES MAY BE ASSUMED OR CONCLUSIONS
INFERRED WITH RATHER TOO MUCH CERTAINTY OR UNIVERSALITY THE VARIATION
AT EACH STEP MAY BE UNOBSERVED AND YET AT LAST THE DIVERGENCE BECOMES
CONSIDERABLE
HENCE THE FAILURE OF ATTEMPTS TO APPLY ARITHMETICAL OR
ALGEBRAIC FORMULAE TO LOGIC
THE IMPERFECTION OR RATHER THE HIGHER
AND MORE ELASTIC NATURE OF LANGUAGE DOES NOT ALLOW WORDS TO HAVE THE
PRECISION OF NUMBERS OR OF SYMBOLS
AND THIS QUALITY IN LANGUAGE IMPAIRS
THE FORCE OF AN ARGUMENT WHICH HAS MANY STEPS
THE OBJECTION THOUGH FAIRLY MET BY SOCRATES IN THIS PARTICULAR
INSTANCE MAY BE REGARDED AS IMPLYING A REFLECTION UPON THE SOCRATIC
MODE OF REASONING
AND HERE AS ELSEWHERE PLATO SEEMS TO INTIMATE THAT
THE TIME HAD COME WHEN THE NEGATIVE AND INTERROGATIVE METHOD OF SOCRATES
MUST BE SUPERSEDED BY A POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE ONE OF WHICH EXAMPLES
ARE GIVEN IN SOME OF THE LATER DIALOGUES
ADEIMANTUS FURTHER ARGUES
THAT THE IDEAL IS WHOLLY AT VARIANCE WITH FACTS FOR EXPERIENCE PROVES
PHILOSOPHERS TO BE EITHER USELESS OR ROGUES
CONTRARY TO ALL EXPECTATION
SOCRATES HAS NO HESITATION IN ADMITTING THE TRUTH OF THIS AND EXPLAINS
THE ANOMALY IN AN ALLEGORY FIRST CHARACTERISTICALLY DEPRECIATING HIS
OWN INVENTIVE POWERS
IN THIS ALLEGORY THE PEOPLE ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM
THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND AS ELSEWHERE ARE SPOKEN OF IN A TONE
OF PITY RATHER THAN OF CENSURE UNDER THE IMAGE OF 'THE NOBLE CAPTAIN WHO
IS NOT VERY QUICK IN HIS PERCEPTIONS
THE USELESSNESS OF PHILOSOPHERS IS EXPLAINED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
MANKIND WILL NOT USE THEM
THE WORLD IN ALL AGES HAS BEEN DIVIDED
BETWEEN CONTEMPT AND FEAR OF THOSE WHO EMPLOY THE POWER OF IDEAS AND
KNOW NO OTHER WEAPONS
CONCERNING THE FALSE PHILOSOPHER SOCRATES ARGUES
THAT THE BEST IS MOST LIABLE TO CORRUPTION AND THAT THE FINER NATURE IS
MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM ALIEN CONDITIONS
WE TOO OBSERVE THAT THERE
ARE SOME KINDS OF EXCELLENCE WHICH SPRING FROM A PECULIAR DELICACY
OF CONSTITUTION AS IS EVIDENTLY TRUE OF THE POETICAL AND IMAGINATIVE
TEMPERAMENT WHICH OFTEN SEEMS TO DEPEND ON IMPRESSIONS AND HENCE CAN
ONLY BREATHE OR LIVE IN A CERTAIN ATMOSPHERE
THE MAN OF GENIUS
HAS GREATER PAINS AND GREATER PLEASURES GREATER POWERS AND GREATER
WEAKNESSES AND OFTEN A GREATER PLAY OF CHARACTER THAN IS TO BE FOUND IN
ORDINARY MEN
HE CAN ASSUME THE DISGUISE OF VIRTUE OR DISINTERESTEDNESS
WITHOUT HAVING THEM OR VEIL PERSONAL ENMITY IN THE LANGUAGE OF
PATRIOTISM AND PHILOSOPHY HE CAN SAY THE WORD WHICH ALL MEN ARE
THINKING HE HAS AN INSIGHT WHICH IS TERRIBLE INTO THE FOLLIES AND
WEAKNESSES OF HIS FELLOW MEN
AN ALCIBIADES A MIRABEAU OR A NAPOLEON
THE FIRST ARE BORN EITHER TO BE THE AUTHORS OF GREAT EVILS IN STATES
OR 'OF GREAT GOOD WHEN THEY ARE DRAWN IN THAT DIRECTION
YET THE THESIS 'CORRUPTIO OPTIMI PESSIMA CANNOT BE MAINTAINED
GENERALLY OR WITHOUT REGARD TO THE KIND OF EXCELLENCE WHICH IS
CORRUPTED
THE ALIEN CONDITIONS WHICH ARE CORRUPTING TO ONE NATURE MAY
BE THE ELEMENTS OF CULTURE TO ANOTHER
IN GENERAL A MAN CAN ONLY RECEIVE
HIS HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT IN A CONGENIAL STATE OR FAMILY AMONG FRIENDS
OR FELLOW WORKERS
BUT ALSO HE MAY SOMETIMES BE STIRRED BY ADVERSE
CIRCUMSTANCES TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE RISES UP AGAINST THEM AND REFORMS
THEM
AND WHILE WEAKER OR COARSER CHARACTERS WILL EXTRACT GOOD OUT OF
EVIL SAY IN A CORRUPT STATE OF THE CHURCH OR OF SOCIETY AND LIVE ON
HAPPILY ALLOWING THE EVIL TO REMAIN THE FINER OR STRONGER NATURES MAY
BE CRUSHED OR SPOILED BY SURROUNDING INFLUENCES MAY BECOME MISANTHROPE
AND PHILANTHROPE BY TURNS OR IN A FEW INSTANCES LIKE THE FOUNDERS
OF THE MONASTIC ORDERS OR THE REFORMERS OWING TO SOME PECULIARITY IN
THEMSELVES OR IN THEIR AGE MAY BREAK AWAY ENTIRELY FROM THE WORLD AND
FROM THE CHURCH SOMETIMES INTO GREAT GOOD SOMETIMES INTO GREAT EVIL
SOMETIMES INTO BOTH
AND THE SAME HOLDS IN THE LESSER SPHERE OF A
CONVENT A SCHOOL A FAMILY
PLATO WOULD HAVE US CONSIDER HOW EASILY THE BEST NATURES ARE OVERPOWERED
BY PUBLIC OPINION AND WHAT EFFORTS THE REST OF MANKIND WILL MAKE TO
GET POSSESSION OF THEM
THE WORLD THE CHURCH THEIR OWN PROFESSION ANY
POLITICAL OR PARTY ORGANIZATION ARE ALWAYS CARRYING THEM OFF THEIR LEGS
AND TEACHING THEM TO APPLY HIGH AND HOLY NAMES TO THEIR OWN PREJUDICES
AND INTERESTS
THE 'MONSTER' CORPORATION TO WHICH THEY BELONG JUDGES
RIGHT AND TRUTH TO BE THE PLEASURE OF THE COMMUNITY
THE INDIVIDUAL
BECOMES ONE WITH HIS ORDER OR IF HE RESISTS THE WORLD IS TOO MUCH FOR
HIM AND WILL SOONER OR LATER BE REVENGED ON HIM
THIS IS PERHAPS A
ONE SIDED BUT NOT WHOLLY UNTRUE PICTURE OF THE MAXIMS AND PRACTICE OF
MANKIND WHEN THEY 'SIT DOWN TOGETHER AT AN ASSEMBLY EITHER IN ANCIENT
OR MODERN TIMES
WHEN THE HIGHER NATURES ARE CORRUPTED BY POLITICS THE LOWER TAKE
POSSESSION OF THE VACANT PLACE OF PHILOSOPHY
THIS IS DESCRIBED IN ONE
OF THOSE CONTINUOUS IMAGES IN WHICH THE ARGUMENT TO USE A PLATONIC
EXPRESSION 'VEILS HERSELF AND WHICH IS DROPPED AND REAPPEARS AT
INTERVALS
THE QUESTION IS ASKED WHY ARE THE CITIZENS OF STATES SO
HOSTILE TO PHILOSOPHY THE ANSWER IS THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW HER
AND YET
THERE IS ALSO A BETTER MIND OF THE MANY THEY WOULD BELIEVE IF THEY WERE
TAUGHT
BUT HITHERTO THEY HAVE ONLY KNOWN A CONVENTIONAL IMITATION OF
PHILOSOPHY WORDS WITHOUT THOUGHTS SYSTEMS WHICH HAVE NO LIFE IN THEM
A DIVINE PERSON UTTERING THE WORDS OF BEAUTY AND FREEDOM THE FRIEND
OF MAN HOLDING COMMUNION WITH THE ETERNAL AND SEEKING TO FRAME THE
STATE IN THAT IMAGE THEY HAVE NEVER KNOWN
THE SAME DOUBLE FEELING
RESPECTING THE MASS OF MANKIND HAS ALWAYS EXISTED AMONG MEN
THE FIRST
THOUGHT IS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE THE ENEMIES OF TRUTH AND RIGHT THE
SECOND THAT THIS ONLY ARISES OUT OF AN ACCIDENTAL ERROR AND CONFUSION
AND THAT THEY DO NOT REALLY HATE THOSE WHO LOVE THEM IF THEY COULD BE
EDUCATED TO KNOW THEM
IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SIXTH BOOK THREE QUESTIONS HAVE TO BE
CONSIDERED 1ST THE NATURE OF THE LONGER AND MORE CIRCUITOUS WAY WHICH
IS CONTRASTED WITH THE SHORTER AND MORE IMPERFECT METHOD OF BOOK IV
2ND THE HEAVENLY PATTERN OR IDEA OF THE STATE 3RD THE RELATION OF THE
DIVISIONS OF KNOWLEDGE TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE CORRESPONDING FACULTIES
OF THE SOUL
1
OF THE HIGHER METHOD OF KNOWLEDGE IN PLATO WE HAVE ONLY A GLIMPSE
NEITHER HERE NOR IN THE PHAEDRUS OR SYMPOSIUM NOR YET IN THE PHILEBUS
OR SOPHIST DOES HE GIVE ANY CLEAR EXPLANATION OF HIS MEANING
HE WOULD
PROBABLY HAVE DESCRIBED HIS METHOD AS PROCEEDING BY REGULAR STEPS TO A
SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE WHICH INFERRED THE PARTS FROM THE WHOLE
RATHER THAN THE WHOLE FROM THE PARTS
THIS IDEAL LOGIC IS NOT PRACTISED
BY HIM IN THE SEARCH AFTER JUSTICE OR IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE PARTS OF
THE SOUL THERE LIKE ARISTOTLE IN THE NICOMACHEAN ETHICS HE ARGUES
FROM EXPERIENCE AND THE COMMON USE OF LANGUAGE
BUT AT THE END OF THE
SIXTH BOOK HE CONCEIVES ANOTHER AND MORE PERFECT METHOD IN WHICH
ALL IDEAS ARE ONLY STEPS OR GRADES OR MOMENTS OF THOUGHT FORMING A
CONNECTED WHOLE WHICH IS SELF SUPPORTING AND IN WHICH CONSISTENCY IS
THE TEST OF TRUTH
HE DOES NOT EXPLAIN TO US IN DETAIL THE NATURE OF THE
PROCESS
LIKE MANY OTHER THINKERS BOTH IN ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES
HIS MIND SEEMS TO BE FILLED WITH A VACANT FORM WHICH HE IS UNABLE TO
REALIZE
HE SUPPOSES THE SCIENCES TO HAVE A NATURAL ORDER AND CONNEXION
IN AN AGE WHEN THEY CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO EXIST
HE IS HASTENING ON TO
THE 'END OF THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD' WITHOUT EVEN MAKING A BEGINNING OF
THEM
IN MODERN TIMES WE HARDLY NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT THE PROCESS OF
ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE IS HERE CONFUSED WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF ABSOLUTE
KNOWLEDGE
IN ALL SCIENCE A PRIORI AND A POSTERIORI TRUTHS MINGLE IN
VARIOUS PROPORTIONS
THE A PRIORI PART IS THAT WHICH IS DERIVED FROM THE
MOST UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE OF MEN OR IS UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED BY
THEM THE A POSTERIORI IS THAT WHICH GROWS UP AROUND THE MORE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND BECOMES IMPERCEPTIBLY ONE WITH THEM
BUT PLATO
ERRONEOUSLY IMAGINES THAT THE SYNTHESIS IS SEPARABLE FROM THE ANALYSIS
AND THAT THE METHOD OF SCIENCE CAN ANTICIPATE SCIENCE
IN ENTERTAINING
SUCH A VISION OF A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE HE IS SUFFICIENTLY JUSTIFIED OR AT
LEAST HIS MEANING MAY BE SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED BY THE SIMILAR ATTEMPTS
OF DESCARTES KANT HEGEL AND EVEN OF BACON HIMSELF IN MODERN
PHILOSOPHY
ANTICIPATIONS OR DIVINATIONS OR PROPHETIC GLIMPSES OF
TRUTHS WHETHER CONCERNING MAN OR NATURE SEEM TO STAND IN THE SAME
RELATION TO ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY WHICH HYPOTHESES BEAR TO MODERN INDUCTIVE
SCIENCE
THESE 'GUESSES AT TRUTH' WERE NOT MADE AT RANDOM THEY AROSE
FROM A SUPERFICIAL IMPRESSION OF UNIFORMITIES AND FIRST PRINCIPLES
IN NATURE WHICH THE GENIUS OF THE GREEK CONTEMPLATING THE EXPANSE OF
HEAVEN AND EARTH SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IN THE DISTANCE
NOR CAN WE DENY
THAT IN ANCIENT TIMES KNOWLEDGE MUST HAVE STOOD STILL AND THE HUMAN
MIND BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE VERY INSTRUMENTS OF THOUGHT IF PHILOSOPHY HAD
BEEN STRICTLY CONFINED TO THE RESULTS OF EXPERIENCE
2
PLATO SUPPOSES THAT WHEN THE TABLET HAS BEEN MADE BLANK THE ARTIST
WILL FILL IN THE LINEAMENTS OF THE IDEAL STATE
IS THIS A PATTERN LAID
UP IN HEAVEN OR MERE VACANCY ON WHICH HE IS SUPPOSED TO GAZE WITH
WONDERING EYE THE ANSWER IS THAT SUCH IDEALS ARE FRAMED PARTLY BY THE
OMISSION OF PARTICULARS PARTLY BY IMAGINATION PERFECTING THE FORM WHICH
EXPERIENCE SUPPLIES PHAEDO
PLATO REPRESENTS THESE IDEALS IN A
FIGURE AS BELONGING TO ANOTHER WORLD AND IN MODERN TIMES THE IDEA WILL
SOMETIMES SEEM TO PRECEDE AT OTHER TIMES TO CO OPERATE WITH THE HAND
OF THE ARTIST
AS IN SCIENCE SO ALSO IN CREATIVE ART THERE IS A
SYNTHETICAL AS WELL AS AN ANALYTICAL METHOD
ONE MAN WILL HAVE THE WHOLE
IN HIS MIND BEFORE HE BEGINS TO ANOTHER THE PROCESSES OF MIND AND HAND
WILL BE SIMULTANEOUS
3
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN SEEING THAT PLATO'S DIVISIONS OF KNOWLEDGE
ARE BASED FIRST ON THE FUNDAMENTAL ANTITHESIS OF SENSIBLE AND
INTELLECTUAL WHICH PERVADES THE WHOLE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY IN WHICH
IS IMPLIED ALSO THE OPPOSITION OF THE PERMANENT AND TRANSIENT OF THE
UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULAR
BUT THE AGE OF PHILOSOPHY IN WHICH HE LIVED
SEEMED TO REQUIRE A FURTHER DISTINCTION NUMBERS AND FIGURES WERE
BEGINNING TO SEPARATE FROM IDEAS
THE WORLD COULD NO LONGER REGARD
JUSTICE AS A CUBE AND WAS LEARNING TO SEE THOUGH IMPERFECTLY THAT
THE ABSTRACTIONS OF SENSE WERE DISTINCT FROM THE ABSTRACTIONS OF MIND
BETWEEN THE ELEATIC BEING OR ESSENCE AND THE SHADOWS OF PHENOMENA THE
PYTHAGOREAN PRINCIPLE OF NUMBER FOUND A PLACE AND WAS AS ARISTOTLE
REMARKS A CONDUCTING MEDIUM FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
HENCE PLATO IS LED
TO INTRODUCE A THIRD TERM WHICH HAD NOT HITHERTO ENTERED INTO THE SCHEME
OF HIS PHILOSOPHY
HE HAD OBSERVED THE USE OF MATHEMATICS IN EDUCATION
THEY WERE THE BEST PREPARATION FOR HIGHER STUDIES
THE SUBJECTIVE
RELATION BETWEEN THEM FURTHER SUGGESTED AN OBJECTIVE ONE ALTHOUGH
THE PASSAGE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER IS REALLY IMAGINARY METAPH
FOR
METAPHYSICAL AND MORAL PHILOSOPHY HAS NO CONNEXION WITH MATHEMATICS
NUMBER AND FIGURE ARE THE ABSTRACTIONS OF TIME AND SPACE NOT THE
EXPRESSIONS OF PURELY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTIONS
WHEN DIVESTED OF
METAPHOR A STRAIGHT LINE OR A SQUARE HAS NO MORE TO DO WITH RIGHT AND
JUSTICE THAN A CROOKED LINE WITH VICE
THE FIGURATIVE ASSOCIATION WAS
MISTAKEN FOR A REAL ONE AND THUS THE THREE LATTER DIVISIONS OF THE
PLATONIC PROPORTION WERE CONSTRUCTED
THERE IS MORE DIFFICULTY IN COMPREHENDING HOW HE ARRIVED AT THE
FIRST TERM OF THE SERIES WHICH IS NOWHERE ELSE MENTIONED AND HAS NO
REFERENCE TO ANY OTHER PART OF HIS SYSTEM
NOR INDEED DOES THE RELATION
OF SHADOWS TO OBJECTS CORRESPOND TO THE RELATION OF NUMBERS TO IDEAS
PROBABLY PLATO HAS BEEN LED BY THE LOVE OF ANALOGY TIMAEUS TO MAKE
FOUR TERMS INSTEAD OF THREE ALTHOUGH THE OBJECTS PERCEIVED IN BOTH
DIVISIONS OF THE LOWER SPHERE ARE EQUALLY OBJECTS OF SENSE
HE IS ALSO
PREPARING THE WAY AS HIS MANNER IS FOR THE SHADOWS OF IMAGES AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTH BOOK AND THE IMITATION OF AN IMITATION IN THE
TENTH
THE LINE MAY BE REGARDED AS REACHING FROM UNITY TO INFINITY AND
IS DIVIDED INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS AND SUBDIVIDED INTO TWO MORE
EACH LOWER SPHERE IS THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE PRECEDING
OF THE FOUR
FACULTIES FAITH IN THE LOWER DIVISION HAS AN INTERMEDIATE POSITION CP
FOR THE USE OF THE WORD FAITH OR BELIEF GREEK TIMAEUS CONTRASTING
EQUALLY WITH THE VAGUENESS OF THE PERCEPTION OF SHADOWS GREEK AND THE
HIGHER CERTAINTY OF UNDERSTANDING GREEK AND REASON GREEK
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDERSTANDING AND MIND OR REASON GREEK IS
ANALOGOUS TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE IN THE PARTS
AND THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE WHOLE
TRUE KNOWLEDGE IS A WHOLE AND IS
AT REST CONSISTENCY AND UNIVERSALITY ARE THE TESTS OF TRUTH
TO THIS
SELF EVIDENCING KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE THE FACULTY OF MIND IS SUPPOSED
TO CORRESPOND
BUT THERE IS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNDERSTANDING WHICH
IS INCOMPLETE AND IN MOTION ALWAYS BECAUSE UNABLE TO REST IN
THE SUBORDINATE IDEAS
THOSE IDEAS ARE CALLED BOTH IMAGES AND
HYPOTHESES IMAGES BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOTHED IN SENSE HYPOTHESES BECAUSE
THEY ARE ASSUMPTIONS ONLY UNTIL THEY ARE BROUGHT INTO CONNEXION WITH
THE IDEA OF GOOD
THE GENERAL MEANING OF THE PASSAGE 'NOBLE THEN IS THE BOND WHICH
LINKS TOGETHER SIGHT AND OF THIS KIND I SPOKE AS THE INTELLIGIBLE
SO FAR AS THE THOUGHT CONTAINED IN IT ADMITS OF BEING TRANSLATED
INTO THE TERMS OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY MAY BE DESCRIBED OR EXPLAINED AS
FOLLOWS THERE IS A TRUTH ONE AND SELF EXISTENT TO WHICH BY THE HELP
OF A LADDER LET DOWN FROM ABOVE THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE MAY ASCEND
THIS
UNITY IS LIKE THE SUN IN THE HEAVENS THE LIGHT BY WHICH ALL THINGS ARE
SEEN THE BEING BY WHICH THEY ARE CREATED AND SUSTAINED
IT IS THE
IDEA OF GOOD
AND THE STEPS OF THE LADDER LEADING UP TO THIS HIGHEST OR
UNIVERSAL EXISTENCE ARE THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES WHICH ALSO CONTAIN
IN THEMSELVES AN ELEMENT OF THE UNIVERSAL
THESE TOO WE SEE IN A NEW
MANNER WHEN WE CONNECT THEM WITH THE IDEA OF GOOD
THEY THEN CEASE TO
BE HYPOTHESES OR PICTURES AND BECOME ESSENTIAL PARTS OF A HIGHER TRUTH
WHICH IS AT ONCE THEIR FIRST PRINCIPLE AND THEIR FINAL CAUSE
WE CANNOT GIVE ANY MORE PRECISE MEANING TO THIS REMARKABLE PASSAGE BUT
WE MAY TRACE IN IT SEVERAL RUDIMENTS OR VESTIGES OF THOUGHT WHICH ARE
COMMON TO US AND TO PLATO SUCH AS 1 THE UNITY AND CORRELATION OF THE
SCIENCES OR RATHER OF SCIENCE FOR IN PLATO'S TIME THEY WERE NOT YET
PARTED OFF OR DISTINGUISHED 2 THE EXISTENCE OF A DIVINE POWER
OR LIFE OR IDEA OR CAUSE OR REASON NOT YET CONCEIVED OR NO LONGER
CONCEIVED AS IN THE TIMAEUS AND ELSEWHERE UNDER THE FORM OF A PERSON
3 THE RECOGNITION OF THE HYPOTHETICAL AND CONDITIONAL CHARACTER OF THE
MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES AND IN A MEASURE OF EVERY SCIENCE WHEN ISOLATED
FROM THE REST 4 THE CONVICTION OF A TRUTH WHICH IS INVISIBLE AND OF
A LAW THOUGH HARDLY A LAW OF NATURE WHICH PERMEATES THE INTELLECTUAL
RATHER THAN THE VISIBLE WORLD
THE METHOD OF SOCRATES IS HESITATING AND TENTATIVE AWAITING THE FULLER
EXPLANATION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD AND OF THE NATURE OF DIALECTIC IN THE
SEVENTH BOOK
THE IMPERFECT INTELLIGENCE OF GLAUCON AND THE RELUCTANCE
OF SOCRATES TO MAKE A BEGINNING MARK THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SUBJECT
THE ALLUSION TO THEAGES' BRIDLE AND TO THE INTERNAL ORACLE OR DEMONIC
SIGN OF SOCRATES WHICH HERE AS ALWAYS IN PLATO IS ONLY PROHIBITORY
THE REMARK THAT THE SALVATION OF ANY REMNANT OF GOOD IN THE PRESENT EVIL
STATE OF THE WORLD IS DUE TO GOD ONLY THE REFERENCE TO A FUTURE STATE
OF EXISTENCE WHICH IS UNKNOWN TO GLAUCON IN THE TENTH BOOK AND IN
WHICH THE DISCUSSIONS OF SOCRATES AND HIS DISCIPLES WOULD BE RESUMED
THE SURPRISE IN THE ANSWERS THE FANCIFUL IRONY OF SOCRATES WHERE
HE PRETENDS THAT HE CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THE STRANGE POSITION OF THE
PHILOSOPHER IN A FIGURE OF SPEECH THE ORIGINAL OBSERVATION THAT THE
SOPHISTS AFTER ALL ARE ONLY THE REPRESENTATIVES AND NOT THE LEADERS
OF PUBLIC OPINION THE PICTURE OF THE PHILOSOPHER STANDING ASIDE IN THE
SHOWER OF SLEET UNDER A WALL THE FIGURE OF 'THE GREAT BEAST' FOLLOWED
BY THE EXPRESSION OF GOOD WILL TOWARDS THE COMMON PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT
HAVE REJECTED THE PHILOSOPHER IF THEY HAD KNOWN HIM THE 'RIGHT NOBLE
THOUGHT' THAT THE HIGHEST TRUTHS DEMAND THE GREATEST EXACTNESS THE
HESITATION OF SOCRATES IN RETURNING ONCE MORE TO HIS WELL WORN THEME OF
THE IDEA OF GOOD THE LUDICROUS EARNESTNESS OF GLAUCON THE COMPARISON
OF PHILOSOPHY TO A DESERTED MAIDEN WHO MARRIES BENEATH HER ARE SOME OF
THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SIXTH BOOK
YET A FEW MORE WORDS MAY BE ADDED ON THE OLD THEME WHICH WAS SO
OFT DISCUSSED IN THE SOCRATIC CIRCLE OF WHICH WE LIKE GLAUCON AND
ADEIMANTUS WOULD FAIN IF POSSIBLE HAVE A CLEARER NOTION
LIKE THEM
WE ARE DISSATISFIED WHEN WE ARE TOLD THAT THE IDEA OF GOOD CAN ONLY BE
REVEALED TO A STUDENT OF THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES AND WE ARE INCLINED
TO THINK THAT NEITHER WE NOR THEY COULD HAVE BEEN LED ALONG THAT PATH TO
ANY SATISFACTORY GOAL
FOR WE HAVE LEARNED THAT DIFFERENCES OF QUANTITY
CANNOT PASS INTO DIFFERENCES OF QUALITY AND THAT THE MATHEMATICAL
SCIENCES CAN NEVER RISE ABOVE THEMSELVES INTO THE SPHERE OF OUR HIGHER
THOUGHTS ALTHOUGH THEY MAY SOMETIMES FURNISH SYMBOLS AND EXPRESSIONS
OF THEM AND MAY TRAIN THE MIND IN HABITS OF ABSTRACTION AND
SELF CONCENTRATION
THE ILLUSION WHICH WAS NATURAL TO AN ANCIENT
PHILOSOPHER HAS CEASED TO BE AN ILLUSION TO US
BUT IF THE PROCESS BY
WHICH WE ARE SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE AT THE IDEA OF GOOD BE REALLY IMAGINARY
MAY NOT THE IDEA ITSELF BE ALSO A MERE ABSTRACTION WE REMARK FIRST
THAT IN ALL AGES AND ESPECIALLY IN PRIMITIVE PHILOSOPHY WORDS SUCH
AS BEING ESSENCE UNITY GOOD HAVE EXERTED AN EXTRAORDINARY INFLUENCE
OVER THE MINDS OF MEN
THE MEAGRENESS OR NEGATIVENESS OF THEIR CONTENT
HAS BEEN IN AN INVERSE RATIO TO THEIR POWER
THEY HAVE BECOME THE FORMS
UNDER WHICH ALL THINGS WERE COMPREHENDED
THERE WAS A NEED OR INSTINCT
IN THE HUMAN SOUL WHICH THEY SATISFIED THEY WERE NOT IDEAS BUT GODS
AND TO THIS NEW MYTHOLOGY THE MEN OF A LATER GENERATION BEGAN TO ATTACH
THE POWERS AND ASSOCIATIONS OF THE ELDER DEITIES
THE IDEA OF GOOD IS ONE OF THOSE SACRED WORDS OR FORMS OF THOUGHT WHICH
WERE BEGINNING TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE OLD MYTHOLOGY
IT MEANT UNITY
IN WHICH ALL TIME AND ALL EXISTENCE WERE GATHERED UP
IT WAS THE TRUTH
OF ALL THINGS AND ALSO THE LIGHT IN WHICH THEY SHONE FORTH AND BECAME
EVIDENT TO INTELLIGENCES HUMAN AND DIVINE
IT WAS THE CAUSE OF ALL
THINGS THE POWER BY WHICH THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO BEING
IT WAS THE
UNIVERSAL REASON DIVESTED OF A HUMAN PERSONALITY
IT WAS THE LIFE
AS WELL AS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD ALL KNOWLEDGE AND ALL POWER WERE
COMPREHENDED IN IT
THE WAY TO IT WAS THROUGH THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
AND THESE TOO WERE DEPENDENT ON IT
TO ASK WHETHER GOD WAS THE MAKER OF
IT OR MADE BY IT WOULD BE LIKE ASKING WHETHER GOD COULD BE CONCEIVED
APART FROM GOODNESS OR GOODNESS APART FROM GOD
THE GOD OF THE TIMAEUS
IS NOT REALLY AT VARIANCE WITH THE IDEA OF GOOD THEY ARE ASPECTS OF
THE SAME DIFFERING ONLY AS THE PERSONAL FROM THE IMPERSONAL OR THE
MASCULINE FROM THE NEUTER THE ONE BEING THE EXPRESSION OR LANGUAGE OF
MYTHOLOGY THE OTHER OF PHILOSOPHY
THIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS THE MEANING OF THE IDEA OF GOOD AS
CONCEIVED BY PLATO
IDEAS OF NUMBER ORDER HARMONY DEVELOPMENT MAY
ALSO BE SAID TO ENTER INTO IT
THE PARAPHRASE WHICH HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN
OF IT GOES BEYOND THE ACTUAL WORDS OF PLATO
WE HAVE PERHAPS ARRIVED AT
THE STAGE OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH ENABLES US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS AIMING
AT BETTER THAN HE DID HIMSELF
WE ARE BEGINNING TO REALIZE WHAT HE SAW
DARKLY AND AT A DISTANCE
BUT IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS OR
SOME CONCEPTION OF THE SAME KIND BUT HIGHER THAN THIS WAS THE TRUTH
AT WHICH HE WAS AIMING AND THE NEED WHICH HE SOUGHT TO SUPPLY HE WOULD
GLADLY HAVE RECOGNIZED THAT MORE WAS CONTAINED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS
THAN HE HIMSELF KNEW
AS HIS WORDS ARE FEW AND HIS MANNER RETICENT
AND TENTATIVE SO MUST THE STYLE OF HIS INTERPRETER BE
WE SHOULD NOT
APPROACH HIS MEANING MORE NEARLY BY ATTEMPTING TO DEFINE IT FURTHER
IN
TRANSLATING HIM INTO THE LANGUAGE OF MODERN THOUGHT WE MIGHT INSENSIBLY
LOSE THE SPIRIT OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY
IT IS REMARKABLE THAT ALTHOUGH
PLATO SPEAKS OF THE IDEA OF GOOD AS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF TRUTH AND
BEING IT IS NOWHERE MENTIONED IN HIS WRITINGS EXCEPT IN THIS PASSAGE
NOR DID IT RETAIN ANY HOLD UPON THE MINDS OF HIS DISCIPLES IN A LATER
GENERATION IT WAS PROBABLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO THEM
NOR DOES THE MENTION
OF IT IN ARISTOTLE APPEAR TO HAVE ANY REFERENCE TO THIS OR ANY OTHER
PASSAGE IN HIS EXTANT WRITINGS
BOOK VII
AND NOW I WILL DESCRIBE IN A FIGURE THE ENLIGHTENMENT OR
UNENLIGHTENMENT OF OUR NATURE IMAGINE HUMAN BEINGS LIVING IN AN
UNDERGROUND DEN WHICH IS OPEN TOWARDS THE LIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN THERE
FROM CHILDHOOD HAVING THEIR NECKS AND LEGS CHAINED AND CAN ONLY SEE
INTO THE DEN
AT A DISTANCE THERE IS A FIRE AND BETWEEN THE FIRE AND
THE PRISONERS A RAISED WAY AND A LOW WALL IS BUILT ALONG THE WAY LIKE
THE SCREEN OVER WHICH MARIONETTE PLAYERS SHOW THEIR PUPPETS
BEHIND THE
WALL APPEAR MOVING FIGURES WHO HOLD IN THEIR HANDS VARIOUS WORKS OF
ART AND AMONG THEM IMAGES OF MEN AND ANIMALS WOOD AND STONE AND SOME
OF THE PASSERS BY ARE TALKING AND OTHERS SILENT
'A STRANGE PARABLE
HE SAID 'AND STRANGE CAPTIVES THEY ARE OURSELVES I REPLIED AND THEY
SEE ONLY THE SHADOWS OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE FIRE THROWS ON THE WALL OF
THE DEN TO THESE THEY GIVE NAMES AND IF WE ADD AN ECHO WHICH RETURNS
FROM THE WALL THE VOICES OF THE PASSENGERS WILL SEEM TO PROCEED FROM
THE SHADOWS
SUPPOSE NOW THAT YOU SUDDENLY TURN THEM ROUND AND MAKE THEM
LOOK WITH PAIN AND GRIEF TO THEMSELVES AT THE REAL IMAGES WILL THEY
BELIEVE THEM TO BE REAL WILL NOT THEIR EYES BE DAZZLED AND WILL THEY
NOT TRY TO GET AWAY FROM THE LIGHT TO SOMETHING WHICH THEY ARE ABLE TO
BEHOLD WITHOUT BLINKING AND SUPPOSE FURTHER THAT THEY ARE DRAGGED UP
A STEEP AND RUGGED ASCENT INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE SUN HIMSELF WILL NOT
THEIR SIGHT BE DARKENED WITH THE EXCESS OF LIGHT SOME TIME WILL PASS
BEFORE THEY GET THE HABIT OF PERCEIVING AT ALL AND AT FIRST THEY WILL
BE ABLE TO PERCEIVE ONLY SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS IN THE WATER THEN THEY
WILL RECOGNIZE THE MOON AND THE STARS AND WILL AT LENGTH BEHOLD THE SUN
IN HIS OWN PROPER PLACE AS HE IS
LAST OF ALL THEY WILL CONCLUDE THIS
IS HE WHO GIVES US THE YEAR AND THE SEASONS AND IS THE AUTHOR OF ALL
THAT WE SEE
HOW WILL THEY REJOICE IN PASSING FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT
HOW WORTHLESS TO THEM WILL SEEM THE HONOURS AND GLORIES OF THE DEN BUT
NOW IMAGINE FURTHER THAT THEY DESCEND INTO THEIR OLD HABITATIONS IN
THAT UNDERGROUND DWELLING THEY WILL NOT SEE AS WELL AS THEIR FELLOWS
AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH THEM IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE
SHADOWS ON THE WALL THERE WILL BE MANY JOKES ABOUT THE MAN WHO WENT ON
A VISIT TO THE SUN AND LOST HIS EYES AND IF THEY FIND ANYBODY TRYING TO
SET FREE AND ENLIGHTEN ONE OF THEIR NUMBER THEY WILL PUT HIM TO DEATH
IF THEY CAN CATCH HIM
NOW THE CAVE OR DEN IS THE WORLD OF SIGHT THE
FIRE IS THE SUN THE WAY UPWARDS IS THE WAY TO KNOWLEDGE AND IN THE
WORLD OF KNOWLEDGE THE IDEA OF GOOD IS LAST SEEN AND WITH DIFFICULTY
BUT WHEN SEEN IS INFERRED TO BE THE AUTHOR OF GOOD AND RIGHT PARENT OF
THE LORD OF LIGHT IN THIS WORLD AND OF TRUTH AND UNDERSTANDING IN THE
OTHER
HE WHO ATTAINS TO THE BEATIFIC VISION IS ALWAYS GOING UPWARDS HE
IS UNWILLING TO DESCEND INTO POLITICAL ASSEMBLIES AND COURTS OF LAW FOR
HIS EYES ARE APT TO BLINK AT THE IMAGES OR SHADOWS OF IMAGES WHICH THEY
BEHOLD IN THEM HE CANNOT ENTER INTO THE IDEAS OF THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER
IN THEIR LIVES UNDERSTOOD THE RELATION OF THE SHADOW TO THE SUBSTANCE
BUT BLINDNESS IS OF TWO KINDS AND MAY BE CAUSED EITHER BY PASSING OUT
OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT OR OUT OF LIGHT INTO DARKNESS AND A MAN OF SENSE
WILL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM AND WILL NOT LAUGH EQUALLY AT BOTH OF
THEM BUT THE BLINDNESS WHICH ARISES FROM FULNESS OF LIGHT HE WILL DEEM
BLESSED AND PITY THE OTHER OR IF HE LAUGH AT THE PUZZLED SOUL LOOKING
AT THE SUN HE WILL HAVE MORE REASON TO LAUGH THAN THE INHABITANTS
OF THE DEN AT THOSE WHO DESCEND FROM ABOVE
THERE IS A FURTHER LESSON
TAUGHT BY THIS PARABLE OF OURS
SOME PERSONS FANCY THAT INSTRUCTION IS
LIKE GIVING EYES TO THE BLIND BUT WE SAY THAT THE FACULTY OF SIGHT WAS
ALWAYS THERE AND THAT THE SOUL ONLY REQUIRES TO BE TURNED ROUND TOWARDS
THE LIGHT
AND THIS IS CONVERSION OTHER VIRTUES ARE ALMOST LIKE BODILY
HABITS AND MAY BE ACQUIRED IN THE SAME MANNER BUT INTELLIGENCE HAS
A DIVINER LIFE AND IS INDESTRUCTIBLE TURNING EITHER TO GOOD OR EVIL
ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTION GIVEN
DID YOU NEVER OBSERVE HOW THE MIND OF
A CLEVER ROGUE PEERS OUT OF HIS EYES AND THE MORE CLEARLY HE SEES THE
MORE EVIL HE DOES NOW IF YOU TAKE SUCH AN ONE AND CUT AWAY FROM HIM
THOSE LEADEN WEIGHTS OF PLEASURE AND DESIRE WHICH BIND HIS SOUL TO
EARTH HIS INTELLIGENCE WILL BE TURNED ROUND AND HE WILL BEHOLD THE
TRUTH AS CLEARLY AS HE NOW DISCERNS HIS MEANER ENDS
AND HAVE WE NOT
DECIDED THAT OUR RULERS MUST NEITHER BE SO UNEDUCATED AS TO HAVE NO
FIXED RULE OF LIFE NOR SO OVER EDUCATED AS TO BE UNWILLING TO LEAVE
THEIR PARADISE FOR THE BUSINESS OF THE WORLD WE MUST CHOOSE OUT
THEREFORE THE NATURES WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO ASCEND TO THE LIGHT AND
KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOOD BUT WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO REMAIN IN THE
REGION OF LIGHT THEY MUST BE FORCED DOWN AGAIN AMONG THE CAPTIVES IN
THE DEN TO PARTAKE OF THEIR LABOURS AND HONOURS
'WILL THEY NOT THINK
THIS A HARDSHIP YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT OUR PURPOSE IN FRAMING THE
STATE WAS NOT THAT OUR CITIZENS SHOULD DO WHAT THEY LIKE BUT THAT THEY
SHOULD SERVE THE STATE FOR THE COMMON GOOD OF ALL
MAY WE NOT FAIRLY
SAY TO OUR PHILOSOPHER FRIEND WE DO YOU NO WRONG FOR IN OTHER STATES
PHILOSOPHY GROWS WILD AND A WILD PLANT OWES NOTHING TO THE GARDENER
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY US TO BE THE RULERS AND KINGS OF OUR HIVE
AND THEREFORE WE MUST INSIST ON YOUR DESCENDING INTO THE DEN
YOU MUST
EACH OF YOU TAKE YOUR TURN AND BECOME ABLE TO USE YOUR EYES IN THE
DARK AND WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE YOU WILL SEE FAR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO
QUARREL ABOUT THE SHADOWS WHOSE KNOWLEDGE IS A DREAM ONLY WHILST YOURS
IS A WAKING REALITY
IT MAY BE THAT THE SAINT OR PHILOSOPHER WHO IS BEST
FITTED MAY ALSO BE THE LEAST INCLINED TO RULE BUT NECESSITY IS LAID
UPON HIM AND HE MUST NO LONGER LIVE IN THE HEAVEN OF IDEAS
AND THIS
WILL BE THE SALVATION OF THE STATE
FOR THOSE WHO RULE MUST NOT BE THOSE
WHO ARE DESIROUS TO RULE AND IF YOU CAN OFFER TO OUR CITIZENS A BETTER
LIFE THAN THAT OF RULERS GENERALLY IS THERE WILL BE A CHANCE THAT THE
RICH NOT ONLY IN THIS WORLD'S GOODS BUT IN VIRTUE AND WISDOM MAY
BEAR RULE
AND THE ONLY LIFE WHICH IS BETTER THAN THE LIFE OF POLITICAL
AMBITION IS THAT OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS ALSO THE BEST PREPARATION FOR
THE GOVERNMENT OF A STATE
THEN NOW COMES THE QUESTION HOW SHALL WE CREATE OUR RULERS WHAT WAY
IS THERE FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT THE CHANGE IS EFFECTED BY PHILOSOPHY
IT IS NOT THE TURNING OVER OF AN OYSTER SHELL BUT THE CONVERSION OF A
SOUL FROM NIGHT TO DAY FROM BECOMING TO BEING
AND WHAT TRAINING WILL
DRAW THE SOUL UPWARDS OUR FORMER EDUCATION HAD TWO BRANCHES GYMNASTIC
WHICH WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE BODY AND MUSIC THE SISTER ART WHICH
INFUSED A NATURAL HARMONY INTO MIND AND LITERATURE BUT NEITHER OF THESE
SCIENCES GAVE ANY PROMISE OF DOING WHAT WE WANT
NOTHING REMAINS TO US
BUT THAT UNIVERSAL OR PRIMARY SCIENCE OF WHICH ALL THE ARTS AND SCIENCES
ARE PARTAKERS I MEAN NUMBER OR CALCULATION
'VERY TRUE INCLUDING THE
ART OF WAR 'YES CERTAINLY THEN THERE IS SOMETHING LUDICROUS ABOUT
PALAMEDES IN THE TRAGEDY COMING IN AND SAYING THAT HE HAD INVENTED
NUMBER AND HAD COUNTED THE RANKS AND SET THEM IN ORDER
FOR IF
AGAMEMNON COULD NOT COUNT HIS FEET AND WITHOUT NUMBER HOW COULD HE
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A PRETTY SORT OF GENERAL INDEED
NO MAN SHOULD BE A
SOLDIER WHO CANNOT COUNT AND INDEED HE IS HARDLY TO BE CALLED A MAN
BUT I AM NOT SPEAKING OF THESE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF ARITHMETIC FOR
NUMBER IN MY VIEW IS RATHER TO BE REGARDED AS A CONDUCTOR TO THOUGHT
AND BEING
I WILL EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY THE LAST EXPRESSION THINGS
SENSIBLE ARE OF TWO KINDS THE ONE CLASS INVITE OR STIMULATE THE MIND
WHILE IN THE OTHER THE MIND ACQUIESCES
NOW THE STIMULATING CLASS ARE
THE THINGS WHICH SUGGEST CONTRAST AND RELATION
FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSE
THAT I HOLD UP TO THE EYES THREE FINGERS A FORE FINGER A MIDDLE
FINGER A LITTLE FINGER THE SIGHT EQUALLY RECOGNIZES ALL THREE FINGERS
BUT WITHOUT NUMBER CANNOT FURTHER DISTINGUISH THEM
OR AGAIN SUPPOSE
TWO OBJECTS TO BE RELATIVELY GREAT AND SMALL THESE IDEAS OF GREATNESS
AND SMALLNESS ARE SUPPLIED NOT BY THE SENSE BUT BY THE MIND
AND THE
PERCEPTION OF THEIR CONTRAST OR RELATION QUICKENS AND SETS IN MOTION
THE MIND WHICH IS PUZZLED BY THE CONFUSED INTIMATIONS OF SENSE AND HAS
RECOURSE TO NUMBER IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE THINGS INDICATED ARE
ONE OR MORE THAN ONE
NUMBER REPLIES THAT THEY ARE TWO AND NOT ONE AND
ARE TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM ONE ANOTHER
AGAIN THE SIGHT BEHOLDS
GREAT AND SMALL BUT ONLY IN A CONFUSED CHAOS AND NOT UNTIL THEY ARE
DISTINGUISHED DOES THE QUESTION ARISE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES WE
ARE THUS LED ON TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE VISIBLE AND INTELLIGIBLE
THAT WAS WHAT I MEANT WHEN I SPOKE OF STIMULANTS TO THE INTELLECT I WAS
THINKING OF THE CONTRADICTIONS WHICH ARISE IN PERCEPTION
THE IDEA
OF UNITY FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THAT OF A FINGER DOES NOT AROUSE THOUGHT
UNLESS INVOLVING SOME CONCEPTION OF PLURALITY BUT WHEN THE ONE IS ALSO
THE OPPOSITE OF ONE THE CONTRADICTION GIVES RISE TO REFLECTION AN
EXAMPLE OF THIS IS AFFORDED BY ANY OBJECT OF SIGHT
ALL NUMBER HAS ALSO
AN ELEVATING EFFECT IT RAISES THE MIND OUT OF THE FOAM AND FLUX OF
GENERATION TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF BEING HAVING LESSER MILITARY AND
RETAIL USES ALSO
THE RETAIL USE IS NOT REQUIRED BY US BUT AS OUR
GUARDIAN IS TO BE A SOLDIER AS WELL AS A PHILOSOPHER THE MILITARY ONE
MAY BE RETAINED
AND TO OUR HIGHER PURPOSE NO SCIENCE CAN BE BETTER
ADAPTED BUT IT MUST BE PURSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF A PHILOSOPHER NOT OF A
SHOPKEEPER
IT IS CONCERNED NOT WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS BUT WITH ABSTRACT
TRUTH FOR NUMBERS ARE PURE ABSTRACTIONS THE TRUE ARITHMETICIAN
INDIGNANTLY DENIES THAT HIS UNIT IS CAPABLE OF DIVISION
WHEN YOU
DIVIDE HE INSISTS THAT YOU ARE ONLY MULTIPLYING HIS 'ONE' IS NOT
MATERIAL OR RESOLVABLE INTO FRACTIONS BUT AN UNVARYING AND ABSOLUTE
EQUALITY AND THIS PROVES THE PURELY INTELLECTUAL CHARACTER OF HIS
STUDY
NOTE ALSO THE GREAT POWER WHICH ARITHMETIC HAS OF SHARPENING THE
WITS NO OTHER DISCIPLINE IS EQUALLY SEVERE OR AN EQUAL TEST OF GENERAL
ABILITY OR EQUALLY IMPROVING TO A STUPID PERSON
LET OUR SECOND BRANCH OF EDUCATION BE GEOMETRY
'I CAN EASILY SEE
REPLIED GLAUCON 'THAT THE SKILL OF THE GENERAL WILL BE DOUBLED BY HIS
KNOWLEDGE OF GEOMETRY THAT IS A SMALL MATTER THE USE OF GEOMETRY TO
WHICH I REFER IS THE ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY IT IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE
IDEA OF GOOD AND THE COMPELLING THE MIND TO LOOK AT TRUE BEING AND NOT
AT GENERATION ONLY
YET THE PRESENT MODE OF PURSUING THESE STUDIES
AS ANY ONE WHO IS THE LEAST OF A MATHEMATICIAN IS AWARE IS MEAN AND
RIDICULOUS THEY ARE MADE TO LOOK DOWNWARDS TO THE ARTS AND NOT UPWARDS
TO ETERNAL EXISTENCE
THE GEOMETER IS ALWAYS TALKING OF SQUARING
SUBTENDING APPOSING AS IF HE HAD IN VIEW ACTION WHEREAS KNOWLEDGE IS
THE REAL OBJECT OF THE STUDY
IT SHOULD ELEVATE THE SOUL AND CREATE
THE MIND OF PHILOSOPHY IT SHOULD RAISE UP WHAT HAS FALLEN DOWN NOT TO
SPEAK OF LESSER USES IN WAR AND MILITARY TACTICS AND IN THE IMPROVEMENT
OF THE FACULTIES
SHALL WE PROPOSE AS A THIRD BRANCH OF OUR EDUCATION ASTRONOMY 'VERY
GOOD REPLIED GLAUCON 'THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HEAVENS IS NECESSARY AT
ONCE FOR HUSBANDRY NAVIGATION MILITARY TACTICS I LIKE YOUR WAY OF
GIVING USEFUL REASONS FOR EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO MAKE FRIENDS OF THE
WORLD
AND THERE IS A DIFFICULTY IN PROVING TO MANKIND THAT EDUCATION IS
NOT ONLY USEFUL INFORMATION BUT A PURIFICATION OF THE EYE OF THE SOUL
WHICH IS BETTER THAN THE BODILY EYE FOR BY THIS ALONE IS TRUTH SEEN
NOW WILL YOU APPEAL TO MANKIND IN GENERAL OR TO THE PHILOSOPHER OR
WOULD YOU PREFER TO LOOK TO YOURSELF ONLY 'EVERY MAN IS HIS OWN BEST
FRIEND THEN TAKE A STEP BACKWARD FOR WE ARE OUT OF ORDER AND INSERT
THE THIRD DIMENSION WHICH IS OF SOLIDS AFTER THE SECOND WHICH IS OF
PLANES AND THEN YOU MAY PROCEED TO SOLIDS IN MOTION
BUT SOLID GEOMETRY
IS NOT POPULAR AND HAS NOT THE PATRONAGE OF THE STATE NOR IS THE USE
OF IT FULLY RECOGNIZED THE DIFFICULTY IS GREAT AND THE VOTARIES OF THE
STUDY ARE CONCEITED AND IMPATIENT
STILL THE CHARM OF THE PURSUIT WINS
UPON MEN AND IF GOVERNMENT WOULD LEND A LITTLE ASSISTANCE THERE
MIGHT BE GREAT PROGRESS MADE
'VERY TRUE REPLIED GLAUCON 'BUT DO
I UNDERSTAND YOU NOW TO BEGIN WITH PLANE GEOMETRY AND TO PLACE NEXT
GEOMETRY OF SOLIDS AND THIRDLY ASTRONOMY OR THE MOTION OF SOLIDS
YES I SAID MY HASTINESS HAS ONLY HINDERED US
'VERY GOOD AND NOW LET US PROCEED TO ASTRONOMY ABOUT WHICH I AM
WILLING TO SPEAK IN YOUR LOFTY STRAIN
NO ONE CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT THE
CONTEMPLATION OF THE HEAVENS DRAWS THE SOUL UPWARDS I AM AN EXCEPTION
THEN ASTRONOMY AS STUDIED AT PRESENT APPEARS TO ME TO DRAW THE SOUL
NOT UPWARDS BUT DOWNWARDS
STAR GAZING IS JUST LOOKING UP AT THE
CEILING NO BETTER A MAN MAY LIE ON HIS BACK ON LAND OR ON WATER HE
MAY LOOK UP OR LOOK DOWN BUT THERE IS NO SCIENCE IN THAT
THE VISION OF
KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH I SPEAK IS SEEN NOT WITH THE EYES BUT WITH THE MIND
ALL THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE HEAVENS IS BUT THE EMBROIDERY OF A COPY
WHICH FALLS FAR SHORT OF THE DIVINE ORIGINAL AND TEACHES NOTHING ABOUT
THE ABSOLUTE HARMONIES OR MOTIONS OF THINGS
THEIR BEAUTY IS LIKE THE
BEAUTY OF FIGURES DRAWN BY THE HAND OF DAEDALUS OR ANY OTHER GREAT
ARTIST WHICH MAY BE USED FOR ILLUSTRATION BUT NO MATHEMATICIAN WOULD
SEEK TO OBTAIN FROM THEM TRUE CONCEPTIONS OF EQUALITY OR NUMERICAL
RELATIONS
HOW RIDICULOUS THEN TO LOOK FOR THESE IN THE MAP OF THE
HEAVENS IN WHICH THE IMPERFECTION OF MATTER COMES IN EVERYWHERE AS A
DISTURBING ELEMENT MARRING THE SYMMETRY OF DAY AND NIGHT OF MONTHS AND
YEARS OF THE SUN AND STARS IN THEIR COURSES
ONLY BY PROBLEMS CAN WE
PLACE ASTRONOMY ON A TRULY SCIENTIFIC BASIS
LET THE HEAVENS ALONE AND
EXERT THE INTELLECT
STILL MATHEMATICS ADMIT OF OTHER APPLICATIONS AS THE PYTHAGOREANS SAY
AND WE AGREE
THERE IS A SISTER SCIENCE OF HARMONICAL MOTION ADAPTED TO
THE EAR AS ASTRONOMY IS TO THE EYE AND THERE MAY BE OTHER APPLICATIONS
ALSO
LET US INQUIRE OF THE PYTHAGOREANS ABOUT THEM NOT FORGETTING
THAT WE HAVE AN AIM HIGHER THAN THEIRS WHICH IS THE RELATION OF THESE
SCIENCES TO THE IDEA OF GOOD
THE ERROR WHICH PERVADES ASTRONOMY ALSO
PERVADES HARMONICS
THE MUSICIANS PUT THEIR EARS IN THE PLACE OF THEIR
MINDS
'YES REPLIED GLAUCON 'I LIKE TO SEE THEM LAYING THEIR EARS
ALONGSIDE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS' FACES SOME SAYING THAT'S A NEW NOTE
OTHERS DECLARING THAT THE TWO NOTES ARE THE SAME YES I SAID BUT YOU
MEAN THE EMPIRICS WHO ARE ALWAYS TWISTING AND TORTURING THE STRINGS
OF THE LYRE AND QUARRELLING ABOUT THE TEMPERS OF THE STRINGS I AM
REFERRING RATHER TO THE PYTHAGOREAN HARMONISTS WHO ARE ALMOST EQUALLY
IN ERROR
FOR THEY INVESTIGATE ONLY THE NUMBERS OF THE CONSONANCES WHICH
ARE HEARD AND ASCEND NO HIGHER OF THE TRUE NUMERICAL HARMONY WHICH
IS UNHEARD AND IS ONLY TO BE FOUND IN PROBLEMS THEY HAVE NOT EVEN A
CONCEPTION
'THAT LAST HE SAID 'MUST BE A MARVELLOUS THING A THING
I REPLIED WHICH IS ONLY USEFUL IF PURSUED WITH A VIEW TO THE GOOD
ALL THESE SCIENCES ARE THE PRELUDE OF THE STRAIN AND ARE PROFITABLE
IF THEY ARE REGARDED IN THEIR NATURAL RELATIONS TO ONE ANOTHER
'I
DARE SAY SOCRATES SAID GLAUCON 'BUT SUCH A STUDY WILL BE AN ENDLESS
BUSINESS WHAT STUDY DO YOU MEAN OF THE PRELUDE OR WHAT FOR ALL
THESE THINGS ARE ONLY THE PRELUDE AND YOU SURELY DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT A
MERE MATHEMATICIAN IS ALSO A DIALECTICIAN 'CERTAINLY NOT
I HAVE HARDLY
EVER KNOWN A MATHEMATICIAN WHO COULD REASON AND YET GLAUCON IS
NOT TRUE REASONING THAT HYMN OF DIALECTIC WHICH IS THE MUSIC OF THE
INTELLECTUAL WORLD AND WHICH WAS BY US COMPARED TO THE EFFORT OF SIGHT
WHEN FROM BEHOLDING THE SHADOWS ON THE WALL WE ARRIVED AT LAST AT
THE IMAGES WHICH GAVE THE SHADOWS EVEN SO THE DIALECTICAL FACULTY
WITHDRAWING FROM SENSE ARRIVES BY THE PURE INTELLECT AT THE
CONTEMPLATION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD AND NEVER RESTS BUT AT THE VERY END
OF THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD
AND THE ROYAL ROAD OUT OF THE CAVE INTO
THE LIGHT AND THE BLINKING OF THE EYES AT THE SUN AND TURNING TO
CONTEMPLATE THE SHADOWS OF REALITY NOT THE SHADOWS OF AN IMAGE
ONLY THIS PROGRESS AND GRADUAL ACQUISITION OF A NEW FACULTY OF SIGHT BY
THE HELP OF THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES IS THE ELEVATION OF THE SOUL TO
THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE HIGHEST IDEAL OF BEING
'SO FAR I AGREE WITH YOU
BUT NOW LEAVING THE PRELUDE LET US PROCEED
TO THE HYMN
WHAT THEN IS THE NATURE OF DIALECTIC AND WHAT ARE THE
PATHS WHICH LEAD THITHER DEAR GLAUCON YOU CANNOT FOLLOW ME HERE
THERE CAN BE NO REVELATION OF THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH TO ONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN
DISCIPLINED IN THE PREVIOUS SCIENCES
BUT THAT THERE IS A SCIENCE OF
ABSOLUTE TRUTH WHICH IS ATTAINED IN SOME WAY VERY DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE NOW PRACTISED I AM CONFIDENT
FOR ALL OTHER ARTS OR SCIENCES ARE
RELATIVE TO HUMAN NEEDS AND OPINIONS AND THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES ARE
BUT A DREAM OR HYPOTHESIS OF TRUE BEING AND NEVER ANALYSE THEIR OWN
PRINCIPLES
DIALECTIC ALONE RISES TO THE PRINCIPLE WHICH IS ABOVE
HYPOTHESES CONVERTING AND GENTLY LEADING THE EYE OF THE SOUL OUT OF THE
BARBAROUS SLOUGH OF IGNORANCE INTO THE LIGHT OF THE UPPER WORLD WITH
THE HELP OF THE SCIENCES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING SCIENCES AS
THEY ARE OFTEN TERMED ALTHOUGH THEY REQUIRE SOME OTHER NAME IMPLYING
GREATER CLEARNESS THAN OPINION AND LESS CLEARNESS THAN SCIENCE AND THIS
IN OUR PREVIOUS SKETCH WAS UNDERSTANDING
AND SO WE GET FOUR NAMES TWO
FOR INTELLECT AND TWO FOR OPINION REASON OR MIND UNDERSTANDING
FAITH PERCEPTION OF SHADOWS WHICH MAKE A PROPORTION
BEING BECOMING INTELLECT OPINION AND SCIENCE BELIEF UNDERSTANDING
PERCEPTION OF SHADOWS
DIALECTIC MAY BE FURTHER DESCRIBED AS THAT
SCIENCE WHICH DEFINES AND EXPLAINS THE ESSENCE OR BEING OF EACH NATURE
WHICH DISTINGUISHES AND ABSTRACTS THE GOOD AND IS READY TO DO BATTLE
AGAINST ALL OPPONENTS IN THE CAUSE OF GOOD
TO HIM WHO IS NOT A
DIALECTICIAN LIFE IS BUT A SLEEPY DREAM AND MANY A MAN IS IN HIS GRAVE
BEFORE HIS IS WELL WAKED UP
AND WOULD YOU HAVE THE FUTURE RULERS OF
YOUR IDEAL STATE INTELLIGENT BEINGS OR STUPID AS POSTS 'CERTAINLY NOT
THE LATTER THEN YOU MUST TRAIN THEM IN DIALECTIC WHICH WILL TEACH
THEM TO ASK AND ANSWER QUESTIONS AND IS THE COPING STONE OF THE
SCIENCES
I DARE SAY THAT YOU HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN HOW OUR RULERS WERE CHOSEN AND
THE PROCESS OF SELECTION MAY BE CARRIED A STEP FURTHER AS BEFORE THEY
MUST BE CONSTANT AND VALIANT GOOD LOOKING AND OF NOBLE MANNERS BUT
NOW THEY MUST ALSO HAVE NATURAL ABILITY WHICH EDUCATION WILL IMPROVE
THAT IS TO SAY THEY MUST BE QUICK AT LEARNING CAPABLE OF MENTAL TOIL
RETENTIVE SOLID DILIGENT NATURES WHO COMBINE INTELLECTUAL WITH
MORAL VIRTUES NOT LAME AND ONE SIDED DILIGENT IN BODILY EXERCISE
AND INDOLENT IN MIND OR CONVERSELY NOT A MAIMED SOUL WHICH HATES
FALSEHOOD AND YET UNINTENTIONALLY IS ALWAYS WALLOWING IN THE MIRE OF
IGNORANCE NOT A BASTARD OR FEEBLE PERSON BUT SOUND IN WIND AND LIMB
AND IN PERFECT CONDITION FOR THE GREAT GYMNASTIC TRIAL OF THE MIND
JUSTICE HERSELF CAN FIND NO FAULT WITH NATURES SUCH AS THESE AND THEY
WILL BE THE SAVIOURS OF OUR STATE DISCIPLES OF ANOTHER SORT WOULD
ONLY MAKE PHILOSOPHY MORE RIDICULOUS THAN SHE IS AT PRESENT
FORGIVE
MY ENTHUSIASM I AM BECOMING EXCITED BUT WHEN I SEE HER TRAMPLED
UNDERFOOT I AM ANGRY AT THE AUTHORS OF HER DISGRACE
'I DID NOT NOTICE
THAT YOU WERE MORE EXCITED THAN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN BUT I FELT THAT
I WAS
NOW DO NOT LET US FORGET ANOTHER POINT IN THE SELECTION OF OUR
DISCIPLES THAT THEY MUST BE YOUNG AND NOT OLD
FOR SOLON IS MISTAKEN
IN SAYING THAT AN OLD MAN CAN BE ALWAYS LEARNING YOUTH IS THE TIME OF
STUDY AND HERE WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE MIND IS FREE AND DAINTY AND
UNLIKE THE BODY MUST NOT BE MADE TO WORK AGAINST THE GRAIN
LEARNING
SHOULD BE AT FIRST A SORT OF PLAY IN WHICH THE NATURAL BENT IS
DETECTED
AS IN TRAINING THEM FOR WAR THE YOUNG DOGS SHOULD AT FIRST
ONLY TASTE BLOOD BUT WHEN THE NECESSARY GYMNASTICS ARE OVER WHICH
DURING TWO OR THREE YEARS DIVIDE LIFE BETWEEN SLEEP AND BODILY EXERCISE
THEN THE EDUCATION OF THE SOUL WILL BECOME A MORE SERIOUS MATTER
AT
TWENTY YEARS OF AGE A SELECTION MUST BE MADE OF THE MORE PROMISING
DISCIPLES WITH WHOM A NEW EPOCH OF EDUCATION WILL BEGIN
THE SCIENCES
WHICH THEY HAVE HITHERTO LEARNED IN FRAGMENTS WILL NOW BE BROUGHT INTO
RELATION WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH TRUE BEING FOR THE POWER OF COMBINING
THEM IS THE TEST OF SPECULATIVE AND DIALECTICAL ABILITY
AND AFTERWARDS
AT THIRTY A FURTHER SELECTION SHALL BE MADE OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO
WITHDRAW FROM THE WORLD OF SENSE INTO THE ABSTRACTION OF IDEAS
BUT
AT THIS POINT JUDGING FROM PRESENT EXPERIENCE THERE IS A DANGER THAT
DIALECTIC MAY BE THE SOURCE OF MANY EVILS
THE DANGER MAY BE ILLUSTRATED
BY A PARALLEL CASE IMAGINE A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IN WEALTH
AND LUXURY AMID A CROWD OF FLATTERERS AND WHO IS SUDDENLY INFORMED THAT
HE IS A SUPPOSITITIOUS SON
HE HAS HITHERTO HONOURED HIS REPUTED PARENTS
AND DISREGARDED THE FLATTERERS AND NOW HE DOES THE REVERSE
THIS IS
JUST WHAT HAPPENS WITH A MAN'S PRINCIPLES
THERE ARE CERTAIN DOCTRINES
WHICH HE LEARNT AT HOME AND WHICH EXERCISED A PARENTAL AUTHORITY
OVER HIM
PRESENTLY HE FINDS THAT IMPUTATIONS ARE CAST UPON THEM A
TROUBLESOME QUERIST COMES AND ASKS 'WHAT IS THE JUST AND GOOD
OR PROVES THAT VIRTUE IS VICE AND VICE VIRTUE AND HIS MIND BECOMES
UNSETTLED AND HE CEASES TO LOVE HONOUR AND OBEY THEM AS HE HAS
HITHERTO DONE
HE IS SEDUCED INTO THE LIFE OF PLEASURE AND BECOMES
A LAWLESS PERSON AND A ROGUE
THE CASE OF SUCH SPECULATORS IS VERY
PITIABLE AND IN ORDER THAT OUR THIRTY YEARS' OLD PUPILS MAY NOT
REQUIRE THIS PITY LET US TAKE EVERY POSSIBLE CARE THAT YOUNG PERSONS DO
NOT STUDY PHILOSOPHY TOO EARLY
FOR A YOUNG MAN IS A SORT OF PUPPY
WHO ONLY PLAYS WITH AN ARGUMENT AND IS REASONED INTO AND OUT OF HIS
OPINIONS EVERY DAY HE SOON BEGINS TO BELIEVE NOTHING AND BRINGS
HIMSELF AND PHILOSOPHY INTO DISCREDIT
A MAN OF THIRTY DOES NOT RUN
ON IN THIS WAY HE WILL ARGUE AND NOT MERELY CONTRADICT AND ADDS NEW
HONOUR TO PHILOSOPHY BY THE SOBRIETY OF HIS CONDUCT
WHAT TIME SHALL WE
ALLOW FOR THIS SECOND GYMNASTIC TRAINING OF THE SOUL SAY TWICE THE
TIME REQUIRED FOR THE GYMNASTICS OF THE BODY SIX OR PERHAPS FIVE
YEARS TO COMMENCE AT THIRTY AND THEN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS LET THE STUDENT
GO DOWN INTO THE DEN AND COMMAND ARMIES AND GAIN EXPERIENCE OF LIFE
AT FIFTY LET HIM RETURN TO THE END OF ALL THINGS AND HAVE HIS EYES
UPLIFTED TO THE IDEA OF GOOD AND ORDER HIS LIFE AFTER THAT PATTERN IF
NECESSARY TAKING HIS TURN AT THE HELM OF STATE AND TRAINING UP OTHERS
TO BE HIS SUCCESSORS
WHEN HIS TIME COMES HE SHALL DEPART IN PEACE TO
THE ISLANDS OF THE BLEST
HE SHALL BE HONOURED WITH SACRIFICES AND
RECEIVE SUCH WORSHIP AS THE PYTHIAN ORACLE APPROVES
'YOU ARE A STATUARY SOCRATES AND HAVE MADE A PERFECT IMAGE OF OUR
GOVERNORS YES AND OF OUR GOVERNESSES FOR THE WOMEN WILL SHARE IN
ALL THINGS WITH THE MEN
AND YOU WILL ADMIT THAT OUR STATE IS NOT A
MERE ASPIRATION BUT MAY REALLY COME INTO BEING WHEN THERE SHALL ARISE
PHILOSOPHER KINGS ONE OR MORE WHO WILL DESPISE EARTHLY VANITIES AND
WILL BE THE SERVANTS OF JUSTICE ONLY
'AND HOW WILL THEY BEGIN THEIR
WORK THEIR FIRST ACT WILL BE TO SEND AWAY INTO THE COUNTRY ALL THOSE
WHO ARE MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF AGE AND TO PROCEED WITH THOSE WHO ARE
LEFT
AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK PLATO ANTICIPATED HIS EXPLANATION
OF THE RELATION OF THE PHILOSOPHER TO THE WORLD IN AN ALLEGORY IN
THIS AS IN OTHER PASSAGES FOLLOWING THE ORDER WHICH HE PRESCRIBES
IN EDUCATION AND PROCEEDING FROM THE CONCRETE TO THE ABSTRACT
AT THE
COMMENCEMENT OF BOOK VII UNDER THE FIGURE OF A CAVE HAVING AN OPENING
TOWARDS A FIRE AND A WAY UPWARDS TO THE TRUE LIGHT HE RETURNS TO VIEW
THE DIVISIONS OF KNOWLEDGE EXHIBITING FAMILIARLY AS IN A PICTURE THE
RESULT WHICH HAD BEEN HARDLY WON BY A GREAT EFFORT OF THOUGHT IN THE
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AT THE SAME TIME CASTING A GLANCE ONWARD AT THE
DIALECTICAL PROCESS WHICH IS REPRESENTED BY THE WAY LEADING FROM
DARKNESS TO LIGHT
THE SHADOWS THE IMAGES THE REFLECTION OF THE
SUN AND STARS IN THE WATER THE STARS AND SUN THEMSELVES SEVERALLY
CORRESPOND THE FIRST TO THE REALM OF FANCY AND POETRY THE SECOND
TO THE WORLD OF SENSE THE THIRD TO THE ABSTRACTIONS OR UNIVERSALS OF
SENSE OF WHICH THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES FURNISH THE TYPE THE FOURTH
AND LAST TO THE SAME ABSTRACTIONS WHEN SEEN IN THE UNITY OF THE IDEA
FROM WHICH THEY DERIVE A NEW MEANING AND POWER
THE TRUE DIALECTICAL
PROCESS BEGINS WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE REAL STARS AND NOT MERE
REFLECTIONS OF THEM AND ENDS WITH THE RECOGNITION OF THE SUN OR IDEA
OF GOOD AS THE PARENT NOT ONLY OF LIGHT BUT OF WARMTH AND GROWTH
TO THE DIVISIONS OF KNOWLEDGE THE STAGES OF EDUCATION PARTLY
ANSWER FIRST THERE IS THE EARLY EDUCATION OF CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH
IN THE FANCIES OF THE POETS AND IN THE LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THE
STATE THEN THERE IS THE TRAINING OF THE BODY TO BE A WARRIOR ATHLETE
AND A GOOD SERVANT OF THE MIND AND THIRDLY AFTER AN INTERVAL FOLLOWS
THE EDUCATION OF LATER LIFE WHICH BEGINS WITH MATHEMATICS AND PROCEEDS
TO PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL
THERE SEEM TO BE TWO GREAT AIMS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO FIRST TO
REALIZE ABSTRACTIONS SECONDLY TO CONNECT THEM
ACCORDING TO HIM THE
TRUE EDUCATION IS THAT WHICH DRAWS MEN FROM BECOMING TO BEING AND TO
A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF ALL BEING
HE DESIRES TO DEVELOP IN THE HUMAN
MIND THE FACULTY OF SEEING THE UNIVERSAL IN ALL THINGS UNTIL AT LAST
THE PARTICULARS OF SENSE DROP AWAY AND THE UNIVERSAL ALONE REMAINS
HE
THEN SEEKS TO COMBINE THE UNIVERSALS WHICH HE HAS DISENGAGED FROM SENSE
NOT PERCEIVING THAT THE CORRELATION OF THEM HAS NO OTHER BASIS BUT THE
COMMON USE OF LANGUAGE
HE NEVER UNDERSTANDS THAT ABSTRACTIONS AS HEGEL
SAYS ARE 'MERE ABSTRACTIONS' OF USE WHEN EMPLOYED IN THE ARRANGEMENT
OF FACTS BUT ADDING NOTHING TO THE SUM OF KNOWLEDGE WHEN PURSUED APART
FROM THEM OR WITH REFERENCE TO AN IMAGINARY IDEA OF GOOD
STILL THE
EXERCISE OF THE FACULTY OF ABSTRACTION APART FROM FACTS HAS ENLARGED THE
MIND AND PLAYED A GREAT PART IN THE EDUCATION OF THE HUMAN RACE
PLATO APPRECIATED THE VALUE OF THIS FACULTY AND SAW THAT IT MIGHT BE
QUICKENED BY THE STUDY OF NUMBER AND RELATION
ALL THINGS IN WHICH
THERE IS OPPOSITION OR PROPORTION ARE SUGGESTIVE OF REFLECTION
THE
MERE IMPRESSION OF SENSE EVOKES NO POWER OF THOUGHT OR OF MIND BUT WHEN
SENSIBLE OBJECTS ASK TO BE COMPARED AND DISTINGUISHED THEN PHILOSOPHY
BEGINS
THE SCIENCE OF ARITHMETIC FIRST SUGGESTS SUCH DISTINCTIONS
THE
FOLLOW IN ORDER THE OTHER SCIENCES OF PLAIN AND SOLID GEOMETRY AND OF
SOLIDS IN MOTION ONE BRANCH OF WHICH IS ASTRONOMY OR THE HARMONY OF
THE SPHERES TO THIS IS APPENDED THE SISTER SCIENCE OF THE HARMONY
OF SOUNDS
PLATO SEEMS ALSO TO HINT AT THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER
APPLICATIONS OF ARITHMETICAL OR MATHEMATICAL PROPORTIONS SUCH AS WE
EMPLOY IN CHEMISTRY AND NATURAL PHILOSOPHY SUCH AS THE PYTHAGOREANS AND
EVEN ARISTOTLE MAKE USE OF IN ETHICS AND POLITICS E G
HIS DISTINCTION
BETWEEN ARITHMETICAL AND GEOMETRICAL PROPORTION IN THE ETHICS BOOK V
OR BETWEEN NUMERICAL AND PROPORTIONAL EQUALITY IN THE POLITICS
THE MODERN MATHEMATICIAN WILL READILY SYMPATHISE WITH PLATO'S DELIGHT
IN THE PROPERTIES OF PURE MATHEMATICS
HE WILL NOT BE DISINCLINED TO SAY
WITH HIM LET ALONE THE HEAVENS AND STUDY THE BEAUTIES OF NUMBER AND
FIGURE IN THEMSELVES
HE TOO WILL BE APT TO DEPRECIATE THEIR APPLICATION
TO THE ARTS
HE WILL OBSERVE THAT PLATO HAS A CONCEPTION OF GEOMETRY
IN WHICH FIGURES ARE TO BE DISPENSED WITH THUS IN A DISTANT AND
SHADOWY WAY SEEMING TO ANTICIPATE THE POSSIBILITY OF WORKING GEOMETRICAL
PROBLEMS BY A MORE GENERAL MODE OF ANALYSIS
HE WILL REMARK WITH
INTEREST ON THE BACKWARD STATE OF SOLID GEOMETRY WHICH ALAS WAS NOT
ENCOURAGED BY THE AID OF THE STATE IN THE AGE OF PLATO AND HE WILL
RECOGNIZE THE GRASP OF PLATO'S MIND IN HIS ABILITY TO CONCEIVE OF
ONE SCIENCE OF SOLIDS IN MOTION INCLUDING THE EARTH AS WELL AS THE
HEAVENS NOT FORGETTING TO NOTICE THE INTIMATION TO WHICH ALLUSION HAS
BEEN ALREADY MADE THAT BESIDES ASTRONOMY AND HARMONICS THE SCIENCE
OF SOLIDS IN MOTION MAY HAVE OTHER APPLICATIONS
STILL MORE WILL HE BE
STRUCK WITH THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF VIEW WHICH LED PLATO AT A TIME
WHEN THESE SCIENCES HARDLY EXISTED TO SAY THAT THEY MUST BE STUDIED IN
RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE IDEA OF GOOD OR COMMON PRINCIPLE
OF TRUTH AND BEING
BUT HE WILL ALSO SEE AND PERHAPS WITHOUT SURPRISE
THAT IN THAT STAGE OF PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE PLATO HAS
FALLEN INTO THE ERROR OF SUPPOSING THAT HE CAN CONSTRUCT THE HEAVENS A
PRIORI BY MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS AND DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLES OF HARMONY
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ADAPTATION OF SOUNDS TO THE HUMAN EAR
THE ILLUSION
WAS A NATURAL ONE IN THAT AGE AND COUNTRY
THE SIMPLICITY AND CERTAINTY
OF ASTRONOMY AND HARMONICS SEEMED TO CONTRAST WITH THE VARIATION AND
COMPLEXITY OF THE WORLD OF SENSE HENCE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THERE WAS
SOME ELEMENTARY BASIS OF FACT SOME MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCE OR TIME OR
VIBRATIONS ON WHICH THEY MUST ULTIMATELY REST WAS OVERLOOKED BY HIM
THE MODERN PREDECESSORS OF NEWTON FELL INTO ERRORS EQUALLY GREAT AND
PLATO CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN VERY FAR WRONG OR MAY EVEN CLAIM
A SORT OF PROPHETIC INSIGHT INTO THE SUBJECT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT
THE GREATER PART OF ASTRONOMY AT THE PRESENT DAY CONSISTS OF ABSTRACT
DYNAMICS BY THE HELP OF WHICH MOST ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN
MADE
THE METAPHYSICAL PHILOSOPHER FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW RECOGNIZES
MATHEMATICS AS AN INSTRUMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH STRENGTHENS THE
POWER OF ATTENTION DEVELOPES THE SENSE OF ORDER AND THE FACULTY OF
CONSTRUCTION AND ENABLES THE MIND TO GRASP UNDER SIMPLE FORMULAE THE
QUANTITATIVE DIFFERENCES OF PHYSICAL PHENOMENA
BUT WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING
THEIR VALUE IN EDUCATION HE SEES ALSO THAT THEY HAVE NO CONNEXION WITH
OUR HIGHER MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL IDEAS
IN THE ATTEMPT WHICH PLATO
MAKES TO CONNECT THEM WE EASILY TRACE THE INFLUENCES OF ANCIENT
PYTHAGOREAN NOTIONS
THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE IS SPEAKING
OF THE IDEAL NUMBERS BUT HE IS DESCRIBING NUMBERS WHICH ARE PURE
ABSTRACTIONS TO WHICH HE ASSIGNS A REAL AND SEPARATE EXISTENCE WHICH
AS 'THE TEACHERS OF THE ART' MEANING PROBABLY THE PYTHAGOREANS WOULD
HAVE AFFIRMED REPEL ALL ATTEMPTS AT SUBDIVISION AND IN WHICH UNITY AND
EVERY OTHER NUMBER ARE CONCEIVED OF AS ABSOLUTE
THE TRUTH AND CERTAINTY
OF NUMBERS WHEN THUS DISENGAGED FROM PHENOMENA GAVE THEM A KIND OF
SACREDNESS IN THE EYES OF AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER
NOR IS IT EASY TO SAY
HOW FAR IDEAS OF ORDER AND FIXEDNESS MAY HAVE HAD A MORAL AND ELEVATING
INFLUENCE ON THE MINDS OF MEN 'WHO IN THE WORDS OF THE TIMAEUS
'MIGHT LEARN TO REGULATE THEIR ERRING LIVES ACCORDING TO THEM IT IS
WORTHY OF REMARK THAT THE OLD PYTHAGOREAN ETHICAL SYMBOLS STILL EXIST AS
FIGURES OF SPEECH AMONG OURSELVES
AND THOSE WHO IN MODERN TIMES SEE THE
WORLD PERVADED BY UNIVERSAL LAW MAY ALSO SEE AN ANTICIPATION OF THIS
LAST WORD OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY IN THE PLATONIC IDEA OF GOOD WHICH
IS THE SOURCE AND MEASURE OF ALL THINGS AND YET ONLY AN ABSTRACTION
PHILEBUS
TWO PASSAGES SEEM TO REQUIRE MORE PARTICULAR EXPLANATIONS
FIRST THAT
WHICH RELATES TO THE ANALYSIS OF VISION
THE DIFFICULTY IN THIS PASSAGE
MAY BE EXPLAINED LIKE MANY OTHERS FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE MODES OF
CONCEPTION PREVAILING AMONG ANCIENT AND MODERN THINKERS
TO US THE
PERCEPTIONS OF SENSE ARE INSEPARABLE FROM THE ACT OF THE MIND WHICH
ACCOMPANIES THEM
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF FORM COLOUR DISTANCE IS
INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SIMPLE SENSATION WHICH IS THE MEDIUM OF
THEM
WHEREAS TO PLATO SENSE IS THE HERACLITEAN FLUX OF SENSE NOT THE
VISION OF OBJECTS IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ACTUALLY PRESENT THEMSELVES
TO THE EXPERIENCED SIGHT BUT AS THEY MAY BE IMAGINED TO APPEAR CONFUSED
AND BLURRED TO THE HALF AWAKENED EYE OF THE INFANT
THE FIRST ACTION OF
THE MIND IS AROUSED BY THE ATTEMPT TO SET IN ORDER THIS CHAOS AND
THE REASON IS REQUIRED TO FRAME DISTINCT CONCEPTIONS UNDER WHICH
THE CONFUSED IMPRESSIONS OF SENSE MAY BE ARRANGED
HENCE ARISES
THE QUESTION 'WHAT IS GREAT WHAT IS SMALL AND THUS BEGINS THE
DISTINCTION OF THE VISIBLE AND THE INTELLIGIBLE
THE SECOND DIFFICULTY RELATES TO PLATO'S CONCEPTION OF HARMONICS
THREE CLASSES OF HARMONISTS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY HIM FIRST THE
PYTHAGOREANS WHOM HE PROPOSES TO CONSULT AS IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
ON MUSIC HE WAS TO CONSULT DAMON THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE MASTERS
IN THE ART BUT ARE ALTOGETHER DEFICIENT IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS HIGHER
IMPORT AND RELATION TO THE GOOD SECONDLY THE MERE EMPIRICS WHOM
GLAUCON APPEARS TO CONFUSE WITH THEM AND WHOM BOTH HE AND SOCRATES
LUDICROUSLY DESCRIBE AS EXPERIMENTING BY MERE AUSCULTATION ON THE
INTERVALS OF SOUNDS
BOTH OF THESE FALL SHORT IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF
THE PLATONIC IDEA OF HARMONY WHICH MUST BE STUDIED IN A PURELY
ABSTRACT WAY FIRST BY THE METHOD OF PROBLEMS AND SECONDLY AS A PART OF
UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE IN RELATION TO THE IDEA OF GOOD
THE ALLEGORY HAS A POLITICAL AS WELL AS A PHILOSOPHICAL MEANING
THE
DEN OR CAVE REPRESENTS THE NARROW SPHERE OF POLITICS OR LAW COMPARE THE
DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILOSOPHER AND LAWYER IN THE THEAETETUS AND
THE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL IDEAS IS SUPPOSED TO EXERCISE A DISTURBING
INFLUENCE ON THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO RETURN TO THIS LOWER WORLD
IN OTHER
WORDS THEIR PRINCIPLES ARE TOO WIDE FOR PRACTICAL APPLICATION THEY ARE
LOOKING FAR AWAY INTO THE PAST AND FUTURE WHEN THEIR BUSINESS IS WITH
THE PRESENT
THE IDEAL IS NOT EASILY REDUCED TO THE CONDITIONS OF ACTUAL
LIFE AND MAY OFTEN BE AT VARIANCE WITH THEM
AND AT FIRST THOSE WHO
RETURN ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE DEN IN THE
MEASUREMENT OF THE SHADOWS AND ARE DERIDED AND PERSECUTED BY THEM BUT
AFTER A WHILE THEY SEE THE THINGS BELOW IN FAR TRUER PROPORTIONS THAN
THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER ASCENDED INTO THE UPPER WORLD
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE POLITICIAN TURNED INTO A PHILOSOPHER AND THE PHILOSOPHER
TURNED INTO A POLITICIAN IS SYMBOLIZED BY THE TWO KINDS OF DISORDERED
EYESIGHT THE ONE WHICH IS EXPERIENCED BY THE CAPTIVE WHO IS TRANSFERRED
FROM DARKNESS TO DAY THE OTHER OF THE HEAVENLY MESSENGER WHO
VOLUNTARILY FOR THE GOOD OF HIS FELLOW MEN DESCENDS INTO THE DEN
IN
WHAT WAY THE BRIGHTER LIGHT IS TO DAWN ON THE INHABITANTS OF THE LOWER
WORLD OR HOW THE IDEA OF GOOD IS TO BECOME THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF
POLITICS IS LEFT UNEXPLAINED BY PLATO
LIKE THE NATURE AND DIVISIONS OF
DIALECTIC OF WHICH GLAUCON IMPATIENTLY DEMANDS TO BE INFORMED PERHAPS
HE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE EXPLANATION COULD NOT BE GIVEN EXCEPT TO A
DISCIPLE OF THE PREVIOUS SCIENCES
SYMPOSIUM
MANY ILLUSTRATIONS OF THIS PART OF THE REPUBLIC MAY BE FOUND IN MODERN
POLITICS AND IN DAILY LIFE
FOR AMONG OURSELVES TOO THERE HAVE
BEEN TWO SORTS OF POLITICIANS OR STATESMEN WHOSE EYESIGHT HAS BECOME
DISORDERED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS
FIRST THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT MEN WHO
IN THE LANGUAGE OF BURKE 'HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH GIVEN TO GENERAL
MAXIMS WHO LIKE J S
MILL OR BURKE HIMSELF HAVE BEEN THEORISTS OR
PHILOSOPHERS BEFORE THEY WERE POLITICIANS OR WHO HAVING BEEN STUDENTS
OF HISTORY HAVE ALLOWED SOME GREAT HISTORICAL PARALLEL SUCH AS THE
ENGLISH REVOLUTION OF 1688 OR POSSIBLY ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY OR ROMAN
IMPERIALISM TO BE THE MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH THEY VIEWED CONTEMPORARY
EVENTS
OR PERHAPS THE LONG PROJECTING SHADOW OF SOME EXISTING
INSTITUTION MAY HAVE DARKENED THEIR VISION
THE CHURCH OF THE FUTURE
THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE FUTURE THE SOCIETY OF THE FUTURE HAVE
SO ABSORBED THEIR MINDS THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO SEE IN THEIR TRUE
PROPORTIONS THE POLITICS OF TO DAY
THEY HAVE BEEN INTOXICATED WITH
GREAT IDEAS SUCH AS LIBERTY OR EQUALITY OR THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF
THE GREATEST NUMBER OR THE BROTHERHOOD OF HUMANITY AND THEY NO
LONGER CARE TO CONSIDER HOW THESE IDEAS MUST BE LIMITED IN PRACTICE OR
HARMONIZED WITH THE CONDITIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
THEY ARE FULL OF LIGHT
BUT THE LIGHT TO THEM HAS BECOME ONLY A SORT OF LUMINOUS MIST OR
BLINDNESS
ALMOST EVERY ONE HAS KNOWN SOME ENTHUSIASTIC HALF EDUCATED
PERSON WHO SEES EVERYTHING AT FALSE DISTANCES AND IN ERRONEOUS
PROPORTIONS
WITH THIS DISORDER OF EYESIGHT MAY BE CONTRASTED ANOTHER OF THOSE WHO
SEE NOT FAR INTO THE DISTANCE BUT WHAT IS NEAR ONLY WHO HAVE BEEN
ENGAGED ALL THEIR LIVES IN A TRADE OR A PROFESSION WHO ARE LIMITED TO
A SET OR SECT OF THEIR OWN
MEN OF THIS KIND HAVE NO UNIVERSAL EXCEPT
THEIR OWN INTERESTS OR THE INTERESTS OF THEIR CLASS NO PRINCIPLE BUT
THE OPINION OF PERSONS LIKE THEMSELVES NO KNOWLEDGE OF AFFAIRS BEYOND
WHAT THEY PICK UP IN THE STREETS OR AT THEIR CLUB
SUPPOSE THEM TO BE
SENT INTO A LARGER WORLD TO UNDERTAKE SOME HIGHER CALLING FROM BEING
TRADESMEN TO TURN GENERALS OR POLITICIANS FROM BEING SCHOOLMASTERS TO
BECOME PHILOSOPHERS OR IMAGINE THEM ON A SUDDEN TO RECEIVE AN INWARD
LIGHT WHICH REVEALS TO THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES A HIGHER
IDEA OF GOD AND THE EXISTENCE OF A SPIRITUAL WORLD BY THIS SUDDEN
CONVERSION OR CHANGE IS NOT THEIR DAILY LIFE LIKELY TO BE UPSET AND ON
THE OTHER HAND WILL NOT MANY OF THEIR OLD PREJUDICES AND NARROWNESSES
STILL ADHERE TO THEM LONG AFTER THEY HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE A MORE
COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HUMAN THINGS FROM FAMILIAR EXAMPLES LIKE THESE WE
MAY LEARN WHAT PLATO MEANT BY THE EYESIGHT WHICH IS LIABLE TO TWO KINDS
OF DISORDERS
NOR HAVE WE ANY DIFFICULTY IN DRAWING A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE YOUNG
ATHENIAN IN THE FIFTH CENTURY BEFORE CHRIST WHO BECAME UNSETTLED BY NEW
IDEAS AND THE STUDENT OF A MODERN UNIVERSITY WHO HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT
OF A SIMILAR 'AUFKLARUNG WE TOO OBSERVE THAT WHEN YOUNG MEN BEGIN TO
CRITICISE CUSTOMARY BELIEFS OR TO ANALYSE THE CONSTITUTION OF HUMAN
NATURE THEY ARE APT TO LOSE HOLD OF SOLID PRINCIPLE GREEK
THEY ARE
LIKE TREES WHICH HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY TRANSPLANTED
THE EARTH ABOUT THEM
IS LOOSE AND THEY HAVE NO ROOTS REACHING FAR INTO THE SOIL
THEY 'LIGHT
UPON EVERY FLOWER FOLLOWING THEIR OWN WAYWARD WILLS OR BECAUSE THE
WIND BLOWS THEM
THEY CATCH OPINIONS AS DISEASES ARE CAUGHT WHEN
THEY ARE IN THE AIR
BORNE HITHER AND THITHER 'THEY SPEEDILY FALL
INTO BELIEFS' THE OPPOSITE OF THOSE IN WHICH THEY WERE BROUGHT UP
THEY
HARDLY RETAIN THE DISTINCTION OF RIGHT AND WRONG THEY SEEM TO THINK ONE
THING AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
THEY SUPPOSE THEMSELVES TO BE SEARCHING AFTER
TRUTH WHEN THEY ARE PLAYING THE GAME OF 'FOLLOW MY LEADER THEY FALL
IN LOVE 'AT FIRST SIGHT' WITH PARADOXES RESPECTING MORALITY SOME FANCY
ABOUT ART SOME NOVELTY OR ECCENTRICITY IN RELIGION AND LIKE LOVERS
THEY ARE SO ABSORBED FOR A TIME IN THEIR NEW NOTION THAT THEY CAN THINK
OF NOTHING ELSE
THE RESOLUTION OF SOME PHILOSOPHICAL OR THEOLOGICAL
QUESTION SEEMS TO THEM MORE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT THAN ANY
SUBSTANTIAL KNOWLEDGE OF LITERATURE OR SCIENCE OR EVEN THAN A GOOD LIFE
LIKE THE YOUTH IN THE PHILEBUS THEY ARE READY TO DISCOURSE TO ANY ONE
ABOUT A NEW PHILOSOPHY
THEY ARE GENERALLY THE DISCIPLES OF SOME EMINENT
PROFESSOR OR SOPHIST WHOM THEY RATHER IMITATE THAN UNDERSTAND
THEY MAY
BE COUNTED HAPPY IF IN LATER YEARS THEY RETAIN SOME OF THE SIMPLE TRUTHS
WHICH THEY ACQUIRED IN EARLY EDUCATION AND WHICH THEY MAY PERHAPS
FIND TO BE WORTH ALL THE REST
SUCH IS THE PICTURE WHICH PLATO DRAWS AND
WHICH WE ONLY REPRODUCE PARTLY IN HIS OWN WORDS OF THE DANGERS WHICH
BESET YOUTH IN TIMES OF TRANSITION WHEN OLD OPINIONS ARE FADING
AWAY AND THE NEW ARE NOT YET FIRMLY ESTABLISHED
THEIR CONDITION IS
INGENIOUSLY COMPARED BY HIM TO THAT OF A SUPPOSITITIOUS SON WHO HAS
MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT HIS REPUTED PARENTS ARE NOT HIS REAL ONES AND
IN CONSEQUENCE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR AUTHORITY OVER HIM
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE MATHEMATICIAN AND THE DIALECTICIAN IS
ALSO NOTICEABLE
PLATO IS VERY WELL AWARE THAT THE FACULTY OF THE
MATHEMATICIAN IS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHER PHILOSOPHICAL SENSE
WHICH RECOGNIZES AND COMBINES FIRST PRINCIPLES
THE CONTEMPT WHICH
HE EXPRESSES FOR DISTINCTIONS OF WORDS THE DANGER OF INVOLUNTARY
FALSEHOOD THE APOLOGY WHICH SOCRATES MAKES FOR HIS EARNESTNESS OF
SPEECH ARE HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PLATONIC STYLE AND MODE OF
THOUGHT
THE QUAINT NOTION THAT IF PALAMEDES WAS THE INVENTOR OF NUMBER
AGAMEMNON COULD NOT HAVE COUNTED HIS FEET THE ART BY WHICH WE ARE MADE
TO BELIEVE THAT THIS STATE OF OURS IS NOT A DREAM ONLY THE GRAVITY
WITH WHICH THE FIRST STEP IS TAKEN IN THE ACTUAL CREATION OF THE STATE
NAMELY THE SENDING OUT OF THE CITY ALL WHO HAD ARRIVED AT TEN YEARS OF
AGE IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE BUSINESS OF EDUCATION BY A GENERATION ARE
ALSO TRULY PLATONIC
FOR THE LAST COMPARE THE PASSAGE AT THE END OF
THE THIRD BOOK IN WHICH HE EXPECTS THE LIE ABOUT THE EARTHBORN MEN TO
BE BELIEVED IN THE SECOND GENERATION
BOOK VIII
AND SO WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE PERFECT
STATE WIVES AND CHILDREN ARE TO BE IN COMMON AND THE EDUCATION AND
PURSUITS OF MEN AND WOMEN BOTH IN WAR AND PEACE ARE TO BE COMMON AND
KINGS ARE TO BE PHILOSOPHERS AND WARRIORS AND THE SOLDIERS OF THE STATE
ARE TO LIVE TOGETHER HAVING ALL THINGS IN COMMON AND THEY ARE TO BE
WARRIOR ATHLETES RECEIVING NO PAY BUT ONLY THEIR FOOD FROM THE OTHER
CITIZENS
NOW LET US RETURN TO THE POINT AT WHICH WE DIGRESSED
'THAT IS
EASILY DONE HE REPLIED 'YOU WERE SPEAKING OF THE STATE WHICH YOU HAD
CONSTRUCTED AND OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ANSWERED TO THIS BOTH OF WHOM
YOU AFFIRMED TO BE GOOD AND YOU SAID THAT OF INFERIOR STATES THERE WERE
FOUR FORMS AND FOUR INDIVIDUALS CORRESPONDING TO THEM WHICH ALTHOUGH
DEFICIENT IN VARIOUS DEGREES WERE ALL OF THEM WORTH INSPECTING WITH
A VIEW TO DETERMINING THE RELATIVE HAPPINESS OR MISERY OF THE BEST OR
WORST MAN
THEN POLEMARCHUS AND ADEIMANTUS INTERRUPTED YOU AND THIS LED
TO ANOTHER ARGUMENT AND SO HERE WE ARE SUPPOSE THAT WE PUT OURSELVES
AGAIN IN THE SAME POSITION AND DO YOU REPEAT YOUR QUESTION
'I SHOULD
LIKE TO KNOW OF WHAT CONSTITUTIONS YOU WERE SPEAKING BESIDES THE
PERFECT STATE THERE ARE ONLY FOUR OF ANY NOTE IN HELLAS FIRST THE
FAMOUS LACEDAEMONIAN OR CRETAN COMMONWEALTH SECONDLY OLIGARCHY A
STATE FULL OF EVILS THIRDLY DEMOCRACY WHICH FOLLOWS NEXT IN ORDER
FOURTHLY TYRANNY WHICH IS THE DISEASE OR DEATH OF ALL GOVERNMENT
NOW STATES ARE NOT MADE OF 'OAK AND ROCK BUT OF FLESH AND BLOOD AND
THEREFORE AS THERE ARE FIVE STATES THERE MUST BE FIVE HUMAN NATURES IN
INDIVIDUALS WHICH CORRESPOND TO THEM
AND FIRST THERE IS THE AMBITIOUS
NATURE WHICH ANSWERS TO THE LACEDAEMONIAN STATE SECONDLY THE
OLIGARCHICAL NATURE THIRDLY THE DEMOCRATICAL AND FOURTHLY THE
TYRANNICAL
THIS LAST WILL HAVE TO BE COMPARED WITH THE PERFECTLY JUST
WHICH IS THE FIFTH THAT WE MAY KNOW WHICH IS THE HAPPIER AND THEN WE
SHALL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ARGUMENT OF THRASYMACHUS OR OUR
OWN IS THE MORE CONVINCING
AND AS BEFORE WE BEGAN WITH THE STATE AND
WENT ON TO THE INDIVIDUAL SO NOW BEGINNING WITH TIMOCRACY LET US
GO ON TO THE TIMOCRATICAL MAN AND THEN PROCEED TO THE OTHER FORMS OF
GOVERNMENT AND THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ANSWER TO THEM
BUT HOW DID TIMOCRACY ARISE OUT OF THE PERFECT STATE PLAINLY LIKE
ALL CHANGES OF GOVERNMENT FROM DIVISION IN THE RULERS
BUT WHENCE CAME
DIVISION 'SING HEAVENLY MUSES AS HOMER SAYS LET THEM CONDESCEND TO
ANSWER US AS IF WE WERE CHILDREN TO WHOM THEY PUT ON A SOLEMN FACE
IN JEST
'AND WHAT WILL THEY SAY THEY WILL SAY THAT HUMAN THINGS ARE
FATED TO DECAY AND EVEN THE PERFECT STATE WILL NOT ESCAPE FROM THIS
LAW OF DESTINY WHEN 'THE WHEEL COMES FULL CIRCLE' IN A PERIOD SHORT OR
LONG
PLANTS OR ANIMALS HAVE TIMES OF FERTILITY AND STERILITY WHICH THE
INTELLIGENCE OF RULERS BECAUSE ALLOYED BY SENSE WILL NOT ENABLE THEM TO
ASCERTAIN AND CHILDREN WILL BE BORN OUT OF SEASON
FOR WHEREAS DIVINE
CREATIONS ARE IN A PERFECT CYCLE OR NUMBER THE HUMAN CREATION IS IN
A NUMBER WHICH DECLINES FROM PERFECTION AND HAS FOUR TERMS AND THREE
INTERVALS OF NUMBERS INCREASING WANING ASSIMILATING DISSIMILATING
AND YET PERFECTLY COMMENSURATE WITH EACH OTHER
THE BASE OF THE NUMBER
WITH A FOURTH ADDED OR WHICH IS 3 4 MULTIPLIED BY FIVE AND CUBED
GIVES TWO HARMONIES THE FIRST A SQUARE NUMBER WHICH IS A HUNDRED
TIMES THE BASE OR A HUNDRED TIMES A HUNDRED THE SECOND AN OBLONG
BEING A HUNDRED SQUARES OF THE RATIONAL DIAMETER OF A FIGURE THE SIDE OF
WHICH IS FIVE SUBTRACTING ONE FROM EACH SQUARE OR TWO PERFECT SQUARES
FROM ALL AND ADDING A HUNDRED CUBES OF THREE
THIS ENTIRE NUMBER IS
GEOMETRICAL AND CONTAINS THE RULE OR LAW OF GENERATION
WHEN THIS LAW IS
NEGLECTED MARRIAGES WILL BE UNPROPITIOUS THE INFERIOR OFFSPRING WHO ARE
THEN BORN WILL IN TIME BECOME THE RULERS THE STATE WILL DECLINE AND
EDUCATION FALL INTO DECAY GYMNASTIC WILL BE PREFERRED TO MUSIC AND
THE GOLD AND SILVER AND BRASS AND IRON WILL FORM A CHAOTIC MASS THUS
DIVISION WILL ARISE
SUCH IS THE MUSES' ANSWER TO OUR QUESTION
'AND A
TRUE ANSWER OF COURSE BUT WHAT MORE HAVE THEY TO SAY THEY SAY THAT
THE TWO RACES THE IRON AND BRASS AND THE SILVER AND GOLD WILL DRAW
THE STATE DIFFERENT WAYS THE ONE WILL TAKE TO TRADE AND MONEYMAKING
AND THE OTHERS HAVING THE TRUE RICHES AND NOT CARING FOR MONEY WILL
RESIST THEM THE CONTEST WILL END IN A COMPROMISE THEY WILL AGREE TO
HAVE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WILL ENSLAVE THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WERE
ONCE THEIR FRIENDS AND NURTURERS
BUT THEY WILL RETAIN THEIR WARLIKE
CHARACTER AND WILL BE CHIEFLY OCCUPIED IN FIGHTING AND EXERCISING RULE
THUS ARISES TIMOCRACY WHICH IS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND
OLIGARCHY
THE NEW FORM OF GOVERNMENT RESEMBLES THE IDEAL IN OBEDIENCE TO RULERS
AND CONTEMPT FOR TRADE AND HAVING COMMON MEALS AND IN DEVOTION
TO WARLIKE AND GYMNASTIC EXERCISES
BUT CORRUPTION HAS CREPT INTO
PHILOSOPHY AND SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WHICH WAS ONCE HER NOTE IS NOW
LOOKED FOR ONLY IN THE MILITARY CLASS
ARTS OF WAR BEGIN TO PREVAIL OVER
ARTS OF PEACE THE RULER IS NO LONGER A PHILOSOPHER AS IN OLIGARCHIES
THERE SPRINGS UP AMONG THEM AN EXTRAVAGANT LOVE OF GAIN GET ANOTHER
MAN'S AND SAVE YOUR OWN IS THEIR PRINCIPLE AND THEY HAVE DARK PLACES
IN WHICH THEY HOARD THEIR GOLD AND SILVER FOR THE USE OF THEIR WOMEN
AND OTHERS THEY TAKE THEIR PLEASURES BY STEALTH LIKE BOYS WHO ARE
RUNNING AWAY FROM THEIR FATHER THE LAW AND THEIR EDUCATION IS NOT
INSPIRED BY THE MUSE BUT IMPOSED BY THE STRONG ARM OF POWER
THE
LEADING CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS STATE IS PARTY SPIRIT AND AMBITION
AND WHAT MANNER OF MAN ANSWERS TO SUCH A STATE 'IN LOVE OF CONTENTION
REPLIED ADEIMANTUS 'HE WILL BE LIKE OUR FRIEND GLAUCON IN THAT
RESPECT PERHAPS BUT NOT IN OTHERS
HE IS SELF ASSERTING AND
ILL EDUCATED YET FOND OF LITERATURE ALTHOUGH NOT HIMSELF A
SPEAKER FIERCE WITH SLAVES BUT OBEDIENT TO RULERS A LOVER OF POWER
AND HONOUR WHICH HE HOPES TO GAIN BY DEEDS OF ARMS FOND TOO OF
GYMNASTICS AND OF HUNTING
AS HE ADVANCES IN YEARS HE GROWS AVARICIOUS
FOR HE HAS LOST PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS THE ONLY SAVIOUR AND GUARDIAN OF
MEN
HIS ORIGIN IS AS FOLLOWS HIS FATHER IS A GOOD MAN DWELLING IN AN
ILL ORDERED STATE WHO HAS RETIRED FROM POLITICS IN ORDER THAT HE MAY
LEAD A QUIET LIFE
HIS MOTHER IS ANGRY AT HER LOSS OF PRECEDENCE AMONG
OTHER WOMEN SHE IS DISGUSTED AT HER HUSBAND'S SELFISHNESS AND SHE
EXPATIATES TO HER SON ON THE UNMANLINESS AND INDOLENCE OF HIS FATHER
THE OLD FAMILY SERVANT TAKES UP THE TALE AND SAYS TO THE YOUTH 'WHEN
YOU GROW UP YOU MUST BE MORE OF A MAN THAN YOUR FATHER ALL THE WORLD
ARE AGREED THAT HE WHO MINDS HIS OWN BUSINESS IS AN IDIOT WHILE A
BUSYBODY IS HIGHLY HONOURED AND ESTEEMED
THE YOUNG MAN COMPARES THIS
SPIRIT WITH HIS FATHER'S WORDS AND WAYS AND AS HE IS NATURALLY WELL
DISPOSED ALTHOUGH HE HAS SUFFERED FROM EVIL INFLUENCES HE RESTS AT A
MIDDLE POINT AND BECOMES AMBITIOUS AND A LOVER OF HONOUR
AND NOW LET US SET ANOTHER CITY OVER AGAINST ANOTHER MAN
THE NEXT FORM
OF GOVERNMENT IS OLIGARCHY IN WHICH THE RULE IS OF THE RICH ONLY NOR
IS IT DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW SUCH A STATE ARISES
THE DECLINE BEGINS WITH
THE POSSESSION OF GOLD AND SILVER ILLEGAL MODES OF EXPENDITURE ARE
INVENTED ONE DRAWS ANOTHER ON AND THE MULTITUDE ARE INFECTED RICHES
OUTWEIGH VIRTUE LOVERS OF MONEY TAKE THE PLACE OF LOVERS OF HONOUR
MISERS OF POLITICIANS AND IN TIME POLITICAL PRIVILEGES ARE CONFINED
BY LAW TO THE RICH WHO DO NOT SHRINK FROM VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO EFFECT
THEIR PURPOSES
THUS MUCH OF THE ORIGIN LET US NEXT CONSIDER THE EVILS OF OLIGARCHY
WOULD A MAN WHO WANTED TO BE SAFE ON A VOYAGE TAKE A BAD PILOT BECAUSE
HE WAS RICH OR REFUSE A GOOD ONE BECAUSE HE WAS POOR AND DOES NOT THE
ANALOGY APPLY STILL MORE TO THE STATE AND THERE ARE YET GREATER EVILS
TWO NATIONS ARE STRUGGLING TOGETHER IN ONE THE RICH AND THE POOR AND
THE RICH DARE NOT PUT ARMS INTO THE HANDS OF THE POOR AND ARE UNWILLING
TO PAY FOR DEFENDERS OUT OF THEIR OWN MONEY
AND HAVE WE NOT ALREADY
CONDEMNED THAT STATE IN WHICH THE SAME PERSONS ARE WARRIORS AS WELL
AS SHOPKEEPERS THE GREATEST EVIL OF ALL IS THAT A MAN MAY SELL HIS
PROPERTY AND HAVE NO PLACE IN THE STATE WHILE THERE IS ONE CLASS WHICH
HAS ENORMOUS WEALTH THE OTHER IS ENTIRELY DESTITUTE
BUT OBSERVE THAT
THESE DESTITUTES HAD NOT REALLY ANY MORE OF THE GOVERNING NATURE IN THEM
WHEN THEY WERE RICH THAN NOW THAT THEY ARE POOR THEY WERE MISERABLE
SPENDTHRIFTS ALWAYS
THEY ARE THE DRONES OF THE HIVE ONLY WHEREAS THE
ACTUAL DRONE IS UNPROVIDED BY NATURE WITH A STING THE TWO LEGGED THINGS
WHOM WE CALL DRONES ARE SOME OF THEM WITHOUT STINGS AND SOME OF THEM
HAVE DREADFUL STINGS IN OTHER WORDS THERE ARE PAUPERS AND THERE ARE
ROGUES
THESE ARE NEVER FAR APART AND IN OLIGARCHICAL CITIES WHERE
NEARLY EVERYBODY IS A PAUPER WHO IS NOT A RULER YOU WILL FIND ABUNDANCE
OF BOTH
AND THIS EVIL STATE OF SOCIETY ORIGINATES IN BAD EDUCATION AND
BAD GOVERNMENT
LIKE STATE LIKE MAN THE CHANGE IN THE LATTER BEGINS WITH THE
REPRESENTATIVE OF TIMOCRACY HE WALKS AT FIRST IN THE WAYS OF HIS
FATHER WHO MAY HAVE BEEN A STATESMAN OR GENERAL PERHAPS AND
PRESENTLY HE SEES HIM 'FALLEN FROM HIS HIGH ESTATE THE VICTIM OF
INFORMERS DYING IN PRISON OR EXILE OR BY THE HAND OF THE EXECUTIONER
THE LESSON WHICH HE THUS RECEIVES MAKES HIM CAUTIOUS HE LEAVES
POLITICS REPRESSES HIS PRIDE AND SAVES PENCE
AVARICE IS ENTHRONED AS
HIS BOSOM'S LORD AND ASSUMES THE STYLE OF THE GREAT KING THE RATIONAL
AND SPIRITED ELEMENTS SIT HUMBLY ON THE GROUND AT EITHER SIDE THE ONE
IMMERSED IN CALCULATION THE OTHER ABSORBED IN THE ADMIRATION OF
WEALTH
THE LOVE OF HONOUR TURNS TO LOVE OF MONEY THE CONVERSION
IS INSTANTANEOUS
THE MAN IS MEAN SAVING TOILING THE SLAVE OF ONE
PASSION WHICH IS THE MASTER OF THE REST IS HE NOT THE VERY IMAGE OF THE
STATE HE HAS HAD NO EDUCATION OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED THE BLIND
GOD OF RICHES TO LEAD THE DANCE WITHIN HIM
AND BEING UNEDUCATED HE WILL
HAVE MANY SLAVISH DESIRES SOME BEGGARLY SOME KNAVISH BREEDING IN HIS
SOUL
IF HE IS THE TRUSTEE OF AN ORPHAN AND HAS THE POWER TO DEFRAUD
HE WILL SOON PROVE THAT HE IS NOT WITHOUT THE WILL AND THAT HIS
PASSIONS ARE ONLY RESTRAINED BY FEAR AND NOT BY REASON
HENCE HE LEADS A
DIVIDED EXISTENCE IN WHICH THE BETTER DESIRES MOSTLY PREVAIL
BUT WHEN
HE IS CONTENDING FOR PRIZES AND OTHER DISTINCTIONS HE IS AFRAID TO
INCUR A LOSS WHICH IS TO BE REPAID ONLY BY BARREN HONOUR IN TIME OF
WAR HE FIGHTS WITH A SMALL PART OF HIS RESOURCES AND USUALLY KEEPS HIS
MONEY AND LOSES THE VICTORY
NEXT COMES DEMOCRACY AND THE DEMOCRATIC MAN OUT OF OLIGARCHY AND
THE OLIGARCHICAL MAN
INSATIABLE AVARICE IS THE RULING PASSION OF AN
OLIGARCHY AND THEY ENCOURAGE EXPENSIVE HABITS IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY
GAIN BY THE RUIN OF EXTRAVAGANT YOUTH
THUS MEN OF FAMILY OFTEN LOSE
THEIR PROPERTY OR RIGHTS OF CITIZENSHIP BUT THEY REMAIN IN THE CITY
FULL OF HATRED AGAINST THE NEW OWNERS OF THEIR ESTATES AND RIPE FOR
REVOLUTION
THE USURER WITH STOOPING WALK PRETENDS NOT TO SEE THEM
HE PASSES BY AND LEAVES HIS STING THAT IS HIS MONEY IN SOME OTHER
VICTIM AND MANY A MAN HAS TO PAY THE PARENT OR PRINCIPAL SUM MULTIPLIED
INTO A FAMILY OF CHILDREN AND IS REDUCED INTO A STATE OF DRONAGE BY
HIM
THE ONLY WAY OF DIMINISHING THE EVIL IS EITHER TO LIMIT A MAN IN
HIS USE OF HIS PROPERTY OR TO INSIST THAT HE SHALL LEND AT HIS OWN
RISK
BUT THE RULING CLASS DO NOT WANT REMEDIES THEY CARE ONLY FOR
MONEY AND ARE AS CARELESS OF VIRTUE AS THE POOREST OF THE CITIZENS
NOW THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH THE GOVERNORS AND THE GOVERNED MEET
TOGETHER AT FESTIVALS ON A JOURNEY VOYAGING OR FIGHTING
THE STURDY
PAUPER FINDS THAT IN THE HOUR OF DANGER HE IS NOT DESPISED HE SEES
THE RICH MAN PUFFING AND PANTING AND DRAWS THE CONCLUSION WHICH HE
PRIVATELY IMPARTS TO HIS COMPANIONS 'THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE NOT GOOD FOR
MUCH AND AS A SICKLY FRAME IS MADE ILL BY A MERE TOUCH FROM WITHOUT
OR SOMETIMES WITHOUT EXTERNAL IMPULSE IS READY TO FALL TO PIECES OF
ITSELF SO FROM THE LEAST CAUSE OR WITH NONE AT ALL THE CITY FALLS ILL
AND FIGHTS A BATTLE FOR LIFE OR DEATH
AND DEMOCRACY COMES INTO POWER
WHEN THE POOR ARE THE VICTORS KILLING SOME AND EXILING SOME AND GIVING
EQUAL SHARES IN THE GOVERNMENT TO ALL THE REST
THE MANNER OF LIFE IN SUCH A STATE IS THAT OF DEMOCRATS THERE IS
FREEDOM AND PLAINNESS OF SPEECH AND EVERY MAN DOES WHAT IS RIGHT IN
HIS OWN EYES AND HAS HIS OWN WAY OF LIFE
HENCE ARISE THE MOST VARIOUS
DEVELOPMENTS OF CHARACTER THE STATE IS LIKE A PIECE OF EMBROIDERY OF
WHICH THE COLOURS AND FIGURES ARE THE MANNERS OF MEN AND THERE ARE MANY
WHO LIKE WOMEN AND CHILDREN PREFER THIS VARIETY TO REAL BEAUTY AND
EXCELLENCE
THE STATE IS NOT ONE BUT MANY LIKE A BAZAAR AT WHICH YOU
CAN BUY ANYTHING
THE GREAT CHARM IS THAT YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE YOU
MAY GOVERN IF YOU LIKE LET IT ALONE IF YOU LIKE GO TO WAR AND MAKE
PEACE IF YOU FEEL DISPOSED AND ALL QUITE IRRESPECTIVE OF ANYBODY
ELSE
WHEN YOU CONDEMN MEN TO DEATH THEY REMAIN ALIVE ALL THE SAME A
GENTLEMAN IS DESIRED TO GO INTO EXILE AND HE STALKS ABOUT THE STREETS
LIKE A HERO AND NOBODY SEES HIM OR CARES FOR HIM
OBSERVE TOO
HOW GRANDLY DEMOCRACY SETS HER FOOT UPON ALL OUR FINE THEORIES OF
EDUCATION HOW LITTLE SHE CARES FOR THE TRAINING OF HER STATESMEN THE
ONLY QUALIFICATION WHICH SHE DEMANDS IS THE PROFESSION OF PATRIOTISM
SUCH IS DEMOCRACY A PLEASING LAWLESS VARIOUS SORT OF GOVERNMENT
DISTRIBUTING EQUALITY TO EQUALS AND UNEQUALS ALIKE
LET US NOW INSPECT THE INDIVIDUAL DEMOCRAT AND FIRST AS IN THE CASE
OF THE STATE WE WILL TRACE HIS ANTECEDENTS
HE IS THE SON OF A MISERLY
OLIGARCH AND HAS BEEN TAUGHT BY HIM TO RESTRAIN THE LOVE OF UNNECESSARY
PLEASURES
PERHAPS I OUGHT TO EXPLAIN THIS LATTER TERM NECESSARY
PLEASURES ARE THOSE WHICH ARE GOOD AND WHICH WE CANNOT DO WITHOUT
UNNECESSARY PLEASURES ARE THOSE WHICH DO NO GOOD AND OF WHICH THE
DESIRE MIGHT BE ERADICATED BY EARLY TRAINING
FOR EXAMPLE THE PLEASURES
OF EATING AND DRINKING ARE NECESSARY AND HEALTHY UP TO A CERTAIN POINT
BEYOND THAT POINT THEY ARE ALIKE HURTFUL TO BODY AND MIND AND THE
EXCESS MAY BE AVOIDED
WHEN IN EXCESS THEY MAY BE RIGHTLY CALLED
EXPENSIVE PLEASURES IN OPPOSITION TO THE USEFUL ONES
AND THE DRONE AS
WE CALLED HIM IS THE SLAVE OF THESE UNNECESSARY PLEASURES AND DESIRES
WHEREAS THE MISERLY OLIGARCH IS SUBJECT ONLY TO THE NECESSARY
THE OLIGARCH CHANGES INTO THE DEMOCRAT IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER THE
YOUTH WHO HAS HAD A MISERLY BRINGING UP GETS A TASTE OF THE DRONE'S
HONEY HE MEETS WITH WILD COMPANIONS WHO INTRODUCE HIM TO EVERY NEW
PLEASURE
AS IN THE STATE SO IN THE INDIVIDUAL THERE ARE ALLIES ON
BOTH SIDES TEMPTATIONS FROM WITHOUT AND PASSIONS FROM WITHIN THERE IS
REASON ALSO AND EXTERNAL INFLUENCES OF PARENTS AND FRIENDS IN ALLIANCE
WITH THE OLIGARCHICAL PRINCIPLE AND THE TWO FACTIONS ARE IN VIOLENT
CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER
SOMETIMES THE PARTY OF ORDER PREVAILS BUT
THEN AGAIN NEW DESIRES AND NEW DISORDERS ARISE AND THE WHOLE MOB OF
PASSIONS GETS POSSESSION OF THE ACROPOLIS THAT IS TO SAY THE SOUL
WHICH THEY FIND VOID AND UNGUARDED BY TRUE WORDS AND WORKS
FALSEHOODS
AND ILLUSIONS ASCEND TO TAKE THEIR PLACE THE PRODIGAL GOES BACK INTO
THE COUNTRY OF THE LOTOPHAGI OR DRONES AND OPENLY DWELLS THERE
AND IF
ANY OFFER OF ALLIANCE OR PARLEY OF INDIVIDUAL ELDERS COMES FROM HOME
THE FALSE SPIRITS SHUT THE GATES OF THE CASTLE AND PERMIT NO ONE TO
ENTER THERE IS A BATTLE AND THEY GAIN THE VICTORY AND STRAIGHTWAY
MAKING ALLIANCE WITH THE DESIRES THEY BANISH MODESTY WHICH THEY CALL
FOLLY AND SEND TEMPERANCE OVER THE BORDER
WHEN THE HOUSE HAS BEEN
SWEPT AND GARNISHED THEY DRESS UP THE EXILED VICES AND CROWNING THEM
WITH GARLANDS BRING THEM BACK UNDER NEW NAMES
INSOLENCE THEY CALL GOOD
BREEDING ANARCHY FREEDOM WASTE MAGNIFICENCE IMPUDENCE COURAGE
SUCH
IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE YOUTH PASSES FROM THE NECESSARY PLEASURES TO
THE UNNECESSARY
AFTER A WHILE HE DIVIDES HIS TIME IMPARTIALLY BETWEEN
THEM AND PERHAPS WHEN HE GETS OLDER AND THE VIOLENCE OF PASSION
HAS ABATED HE RESTORES SOME OF THE EXILES AND LIVES IN A SORT OF
EQUILIBRIUM INDULGING FIRST ONE PLEASURE AND THEN ANOTHER AND IF
REASON COMES AND TELLS HIM THAT SOME PLEASURES ARE GOOD AND HONOURABLE
AND OTHERS BAD AND VILE HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AND SAYS THAT HE CAN MAKE
NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM
THUS HE LIVES IN THE FANCY OF THE HOUR
SOMETIMES HE TAKES TO DRINK AND THEN HE TURNS ABSTAINER HE PRACTISES
IN THE GYMNASIUM OR HE DOES NOTHING AT ALL THEN AGAIN HE WOULD BE A
PHILOSOPHER OR A POLITICIAN OR AGAIN HE WOULD BE A WARRIOR OR A MAN OF
BUSINESS HE IS
'EVERY THING BY STARTS AND NOTHING LONG
THERE REMAINS STILL THE FINEST AND FAIREST OF ALL MEN AND ALL
STATES TYRANNY AND THE TYRANT
TYRANNY SPRINGS FROM DEMOCRACY MUCH AS
DEMOCRACY SPRINGS FROM OLIGARCHY
BOTH ARISE FROM EXCESS THE ONE FROM
EXCESS OF WEALTH THE OTHER FROM EXCESS OF FREEDOM
'THE GREAT NATURAL
GOOD OF LIFE SAYS THE DEMOCRAT 'IS FREEDOM AND THIS EXCLUSIVE LOVE
OF FREEDOM AND REGARDLESSNESS OF EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE CAUSE OF THE
CHANGE FROM DEMOCRACY TO TYRANNY
THE STATE DEMANDS THE STRONG WINE OF
FREEDOM AND UNLESS HER RULERS GIVE HER A PLENTIFUL DRAUGHT PUNISHES
AND INSULTS THEM EQUALITY AND FRATERNITY OF GOVERNORS AND GOVERNED IS
THE APPROVED PRINCIPLE
ANARCHY IS THE LAW NOT OF THE STATE ONLY BUT
OF PRIVATE HOUSES AND EXTENDS EVEN TO THE ANIMALS
FATHER AND SON
CITIZEN AND FOREIGNER TEACHER AND PUPIL OLD AND YOUNG ARE ALL ON A
LEVEL FATHERS AND TEACHERS FEAR THEIR SONS AND PUPILS AND THE WISDOM
OF THE YOUNG MAN IS A MATCH FOR THE ELDER AND THE OLD IMITATE THE
JAUNTY MANNERS OF THE YOUNG BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF BEING THOUGHT
MOROSE
SLAVES ARE ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR MASTERS AND MISTRESSES AND
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN
NAY THE VERY ANIMALS IN
A DEMOCRATIC STATE HAVE A FREEDOM WHICH IS UNKNOWN IN OTHER PLACES
THE
SHE DOGS ARE AS GOOD AS THEIR SHE MISTRESSES AND HORSES AND ASSES MARCH
ALONG WITH DIGNITY AND RUN THEIR NOSES AGAINST ANYBODY WHO COMES IN
THEIR WAY
'THAT HAS OFTEN BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AT LAST THE CITIZENS
BECOME SO SENSITIVE THAT THEY CANNOT ENDURE THE YOKE OF LAWS WRITTEN OR
UNWRITTEN THEY WOULD HAVE NO MAN CALL HIMSELF THEIR MASTER
SUCH IS THE
GLORIOUS BEGINNING OF THINGS OUT OF WHICH TYRANNY SPRINGS
'GLORIOUS
INDEED BUT WHAT IS TO FOLLOW THE RUIN OF OLIGARCHY IS THE RUIN OF
DEMOCRACY FOR THERE IS A LAW OF CONTRARIES THE EXCESS OF FREEDOM
PASSES INTO THE EXCESS OF SLAVERY AND THE GREATER THE FREEDOM THE
GREATER THE SLAVERY
YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT IN THE OLIGARCHY WERE FOUND
TWO CLASSES ROGUES AND PAUPERS WHOM WE COMPARED TO DRONES WITH AND
WITHOUT STINGS
THESE TWO CLASSES ARE TO THE STATE WHAT PHLEGM AND BILE
ARE TO THE HUMAN BODY AND THE STATE PHYSICIAN OR LEGISLATOR MUST GET
RID OF THEM JUST AS THE BEE MASTER KEEPS THE DRONES OUT OF THE HIVE
NOW IN A DEMOCRACY TOO THERE ARE DRONES BUT THEY ARE MORE NUMEROUS
AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN IN THE OLIGARCHY THERE THEY ARE INERT AND
UNPRACTISED HERE THEY ARE FULL OF LIFE AND ANIMATION AND THE KEENER
SORT SPEAK AND ACT WHILE THE OTHERS BUZZ ABOUT THE BEMA AND PREVENT
THEIR OPPONENTS FROM BEING HEARD
AND THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS IN
DEMOCRATIC STATES OF RESPECTABLE THRIVING INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN BE
SQUEEZED WHEN THE DRONES HAVE NEED OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THERE IS
MOREOVER A THIRD CLASS WHO ARE THE LABOURERS AND THE ARTISANS AND
THEY MAKE UP THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE
WHEN THE PEOPLE MEET THEY
ARE OMNIPOTENT BUT THEY CANNOT BE BROUGHT TOGETHER UNLESS THEY ARE
ATTRACTED BY A LITTLE HONEY AND THE RICH ARE MADE TO SUPPLY THE HONEY
OF WHICH THE DEMAGOGUES KEEP THE GREATER PART THEMSELVES GIVING A TASTE
ONLY TO THE MOB
THEIR VICTIMS ATTEMPT TO RESIST THEY ARE DRIVEN MAD
BY THE STINGS OF THE DRONES AND SO BECOME DOWNRIGHT OLIGARCHS IN
SELF DEFENCE
THEN FOLLOW INFORMATIONS AND CONVICTIONS FOR TREASON
THE
PEOPLE HAVE SOME PROTECTOR WHOM THEY NURSE INTO GREATNESS AND FROM THIS
ROOT THE TREE OF TYRANNY SPRINGS
THE NATURE OF THE CHANGE IS INDICATED
IN THE OLD FABLE OF THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS LYCAEUS WHICH TELLS HOW HE WHO
TASTES HUMAN FLESH MIXED UP WITH THE FLESH OF OTHER VICTIMS WILL TURN
INTO A WOLF
EVEN SO THE PROTECTOR WHO TASTES HUMAN BLOOD AND SLAYS
SOME AND EXILES OTHERS WITH OR WITHOUT LAW WHO HINTS AT ABOLITION OF
DEBTS AND DIVISION OF LANDS MUST EITHER PERISH OR BECOME A WOLF THAT
IS A TYRANT
PERHAPS HE IS DRIVEN OUT BUT HE SOON COMES BACK FROM
EXILE AND THEN IF HIS ENEMIES CANNOT GET RID OF HIM BY LAWFUL MEANS
THEY PLOT HIS ASSASSINATION
THEREUPON THE FRIEND OF THE PEOPLE MAKES
HIS WELL KNOWN REQUEST TO THEM FOR A BODY GUARD WHICH THEY READILY
GRANT THINKING ONLY OF HIS DANGER AND NOT OF THEIR OWN
NOW LET THE
RICH MAN MAKE TO HIMSELF WINGS FOR HE WILL NEVER RUN AWAY AGAIN IF HE
DOES NOT DO SO THEN
AND THE GREAT PROTECTOR HAVING CRUSHED ALL HIS
RIVALS STANDS PROUDLY ERECT IN THE CHARIOT OF STATE A FULL BLOWN
TYRANT LET US ENQUIRE INTO THE NATURE OF HIS HAPPINESS
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS TYRANNY HE SMILES AND BEAMS UPON EVERYBODY HE
IS NOT A 'DOMINUS NO NOT HE HE HAS ONLY COME TO PUT AN END TO DEBT
AND THE MONOPOLY OF LAND
HAVING GOT RID OF FOREIGN ENEMIES HE MAKES
HIMSELF NECESSARY TO THE STATE BY ALWAYS GOING TO WAR
HE IS THUS
ENABLED TO DEPRESS THE POOR BY HEAVY TAXES AND SO KEEP THEM AT WORK
AND HE CAN GET RID OF BOLDER SPIRITS BY HANDING THEM OVER TO THE ENEMY
THEN COMES UNPOPULARITY SOME OF HIS OLD ASSOCIATES HAVE THE COURAGE TO
OPPOSE HIM
THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT HE HAS TO MAKE A PURGATION OF THE
STATE BUT UNLIKE THE PHYSICIAN WHO PURGES AWAY THE BAD HE MUST GET
RID OF THE HIGH SPIRITED THE WISE AND THE WEALTHY FOR HE HAS NO CHOICE
BETWEEN DEATH AND A LIFE OF SHAME AND DISHONOUR
AND THE MORE HATED HE
IS THE MORE HE WILL REQUIRE TRUSTY GUARDS BUT HOW WILL HE OBTAIN THEM
'THEY WILL COME FLOCKING LIKE BIRDS FOR PAY WILL HE NOT RATHER OBTAIN
THEM ON THE SPOT HE WILL TAKE THE SLAVES FROM THEIR OWNERS AND MAKE
THEM HIS BODY GUARD THESE ARE HIS TRUSTED FRIENDS WHO ADMIRE AND
LOOK UP TO HIM
ARE NOT THE TRAGIC POETS WISE WHO MAGNIFY AND EXALT THE
TYRANT AND SAY THAT HE IS WISE BY ASSOCIATION WITH THE WISE AND ARE
NOT THEIR PRAISES OF TYRANNY ALONE A SUFFICIENT REASON WHY WE SHOULD
EXCLUDE THEM FROM OUR STATE THEY MAY GO TO OTHER CITIES AND GATHER THE
MOB ABOUT THEM WITH FINE WORDS AND CHANGE COMMONWEALTHS INTO TYRANNIES
AND DEMOCRACIES RECEIVING HONOURS AND REWARDS FOR THEIR SERVICES BUT
THE HIGHER THEY AND THEIR FRIENDS ASCEND CONSTITUTION HILL THE MORE
THEIR HONOUR WILL FAIL AND BECOME 'TOO ASTHMATIC TO MOUNT TO RETURN TO
THE TYRANT HOW WILL HE SUPPORT THAT RARE ARMY OF HIS FIRST BY ROBBING
THE TEMPLES OF THEIR TREASURES WHICH WILL ENABLE HIM TO LIGHTEN THE
TAXES THEN HE WILL TAKE ALL HIS FATHER'S PROPERTY AND SPEND IT ON
HIS COMPANIONS MALE OR FEMALE
NOW HIS FATHER IS THE DEMUS AND IF THE
DEMUS GETS ANGRY AND SAYS THAT A GREAT HULKING SON OUGHT NOT TO BE A
BURDEN ON HIS PARENTS AND BIDS HIM AND HIS RIOTOUS CREW BEGONE THEN
WILL THE PARENT KNOW WHAT A MONSTER HE HAS BEEN NURTURING AND THAT THE
SON WHOM HE WOULD FAIN EXPEL IS TOO STRONG FOR HIM
'YOU DO NOT MEAN TO
SAY THAT HE WILL BEAT HIS FATHER YES HE WILL AFTER HAVING TAKEN AWAY
HIS ARMS
'THEN HE IS A PARRICIDE AND A CRUEL UNNATURAL SON AND THE
PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED FROM THE FEAR OF SLAVERY INTO SLAVERY OUT OF THE
SMOKE INTO THE FIRE
THUS LIBERTY WHEN OUT OF ALL ORDER AND REASON
PASSES INTO THE WORST FORM OF SERVITUDE
IN THE PREVIOUS BOOKS PLATO HAS DESCRIBED THE IDEAL STATE NOW HE
RETURNS TO THE PERVERTED OR DECLINING FORMS ON WHICH HE HAD LIGHTLY
TOUCHED AT THE END OF BOOK IV
THESE HE DESCRIBES IN A SUCCESSION OF
PARALLELS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE STATES TRACING THE ORIGIN OF
EITHER IN THE STATE OR INDIVIDUAL WHICH HAS PRECEDED THEM
HE BEGINS
BY ASKING THE POINT AT WHICH HE DIGRESSED AND IS THUS LED SHORTLY TO
RECAPITULATE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE THREE FORMER BOOKS WHICH ALSO CONTAIN
A PARALLEL OF THE PHILOSOPHER AND THE STATE
OF THE FIRST DECLINE HE GIVES NO INTELLIGIBLE ACCOUNT HE WOULD NOT HAVE
LIKED TO ADMIT THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSES OF THE FALL OF HIS IDEAL STATE
WHICH TO US WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE IMPRACTICABILITY OF COMMUNISM OR THE
NATURAL ANTAGONISM OF THE RULING AND SUBJECT CLASSES
HE THROWS A
VEIL OF MYSTERY OVER THE ORIGIN OF THE DECLINE WHICH HE ATTRIBUTES TO
IGNORANCE OF THE LAW OF POPULATION
OF THIS LAW THE FAMOUS GEOMETRICAL
FIGURE OR NUMBER IS THE EXPRESSION
LIKE THE ANCIENTS IN GENERAL HE HAD
NO IDEA OF THE GRADUAL PERFECTIBILITY OF MAN OR OF THE EDUCATION OF THE
HUMAN RACE
HIS IDEAL WAS NOT TO BE ATTAINED IN THE COURSE OF AGES BUT
WAS TO SPRING IN FULL ARMOUR FROM THE HEAD OF THE LEGISLATOR
WHEN GOOD
LAWS HAD BEEN GIVEN HE THOUGHT ONLY OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE
LIKELY TO BE CORRUPTED OR OF HOW THEY MIGHT BE FILLED UP IN DETAIL OR
RESTORED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL SPIRIT
HE APPEARS NOT TO
HAVE REFLECTED UPON THE FULL MEANING OF HIS OWN WORDS 'IN THE BRIEF
SPACE OF HUMAN LIFE NOTHING GREAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED' OR AGAIN AS HE
AFTERWARDS SAYS IN THE LAWS 'INFINITE TIME IS THE MAKER OF CITIES THE
ORDER OF CONSTITUTIONS WHICH IS ADOPTED BY HIM REPRESENTS AN ORDER OF
THOUGHT RATHER THAN A SUCCESSION OF TIME AND MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE
FIRST ATTEMPT TO FRAME A PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
THE FIRST OF THESE DECLINING STATES IS TIMOCRACY OR THE GOVERNMENT OF
SOLDIERS AND LOVERS OF HONOUR WHICH ANSWERS TO THE SPARTAN STATE THIS
IS A GOVERNMENT OF FORCE IN WHICH EDUCATION IS NOT INSPIRED BY THE
MUSES BUT IMPOSED BY THE LAW AND IN WHICH ALL THE FINER ELEMENTS OF
ORGANIZATION HAVE DISAPPEARED
THE PHILOSOPHER HIMSELF HAS LOST THE
LOVE OF TRUTH AND THE SOLDIER WHO IS OF A SIMPLER AND HONESTER NATURE
RULES IN HIS STEAD
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ANSWERS TO TIMOCRACY HAS SOME
NOTICEABLE QUALITIES
HE IS DESCRIBED AS ILL EDUCATED BUT LIKE THE
SPARTAN A LOVER OF LITERATURE AND ALTHOUGH HE IS A HARSH MASTER TO HIS
SERVANTS HE HAS NO NATURAL SUPERIORITY OVER THEM
HIS CHARACTER IS
BASED UPON A REACTION AGAINST THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS FATHER WHO IN
A TROUBLED CITY HAS RETIRED FROM POLITICS AND HIS MOTHER WHO IS
DISSATISFIED AT HER OWN POSITION IS ALWAYS URGING HIM TOWARDS THE LIFE
OF POLITICAL AMBITION
SUCH A CHARACTER MAY HAVE HAD THIS ORIGIN AND
INDEED LIVY ATTRIBUTES THE LICINIAN LAWS TO A FEMININE JEALOUSY OF A
SIMILAR KIND
BUT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MANNER
IN WHICH THE TIMOCRATIC STATE SPRINGS OUT OF THE IDEAL AND THE MERE
ACCIDENT BY WHICH THE TIMOCRATIC MAN IS THE SON OF A RETIRED STATESMAN
THE TWO NEXT STAGES IN THE DECLINE OF CONSTITUTIONS HAVE EVEN LESS
HISTORICAL FOUNDATION
FOR THERE IS NO TRACE IN GREEK HISTORY OF A
POLITY LIKE THE SPARTAN OR CRETAN PASSING INTO AN OLIGARCHY OF WEALTH
OR OF THE OLIGARCHY OF WEALTH PASSING INTO A DEMOCRACY
THE ORDER OF
HISTORY APPEARS TO BE DIFFERENT FIRST IN THE HOMERIC TIMES THERE IS
THE ROYAL OR PATRIARCHAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH A CENTURY OR TWO
LATER WAS SUCCEEDED BY AN OLIGARCHY OF BIRTH RATHER THAN OF WEALTH AND
IN WHICH WEALTH WAS ONLY THE ACCIDENT OF THE HEREDITARY POSSESSION OF
LAND AND POWER
SOMETIMES THIS OLIGARCHICAL GOVERNMENT GAVE WAY TO A
GOVERNMENT BASED UPON A QUALIFICATION OF PROPERTY WHICH ACCORDING TO
ARISTOTLE'S MODE OF USING WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A TIMOCRACY
AND THIS IN SOME CITIES AS AT ATHENS BECAME THE CONDUCTING MEDIUM TO
DEMOCRACY
BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE NECESSARY ORDER OF SUCCESSION IN STATES
NOR INDEED CAN ANY ORDER BE DISCERNED IN THE ENDLESS FLUCTUATION OF
GREEK HISTORY LIKE THE TIDES IN THE EURIPUS EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE
ALMOST UNIFORM TENDENCY FROM MONARCHY TO ARISTOCRACY IN THE EARLIEST
TIMES
AT FIRST SIGHT THERE APPEARS TO BE A SIMILAR INVERSION IN THE
LAST STEP OF THE PLATONIC SUCCESSION FOR TYRANNY INSTEAD OF BEING THE
NATURAL END OF DEMOCRACY IN EARLY GREEK HISTORY APPEARS RATHER AS A
STAGE LEADING TO DEMOCRACY THE REIGN OF PEISISTRATUS AND HIS SONS IS
AN EPISODE WHICH COMES BETWEEN THE LEGISLATION OF SOLON AND THE
CONSTITUTION OF CLEISTHENES AND SOME SECRET CAUSE COMMON TO THEM ALL
SEEMS TO HAVE LED THE GREATER PART OF HELLAS AT HER FIRST APPEARANCE
IN THE DAWN OF HISTORY E G
ATHENS ARGOS CORINTH SICYON AND NEARLY
EVERY STATE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SPARTA THROUGH A SIMILAR STAGE OF
TYRANNY WHICH ENDED EITHER IN OLIGARCHY OR DEMOCRACY
BUT THEN WE MUST
REMEMBER THAT PLATO IS DESCRIBING RATHER THE CONTEMPORARY GOVERNMENTS
OF THE SICILIAN STATES WHICH ALTERNATED BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND TYRANNY
THAN THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF ATHENS OR CORINTH
THE PORTRAIT OF THE TYRANT HIMSELF IS JUST SUCH AS THE LATER GREEK
DELIGHTED TO DRAW OF PHALARIS AND DIONYSIUS IN WHICH AS IN THE LIVES
OF MEDIAEVAL SAINTS OR MYTHIC HEROES THE CONDUCT AND ACTIONS OF ONE
WERE ATTRIBUTED TO ANOTHER IN ORDER TO FILL UP THE OUTLINE
THERE WAS
NO ENORMITY WHICH THE GREEK WAS NOT TODAY TO BELIEVE OF THEM THE TYRANT
WAS THE NEGATION OF GOVERNMENT AND LAW HIS ASSASSINATION WAS GLORIOUS
THERE WAS NO CRIME HOWEVER UNNATURAL WHICH MIGHT NOT WITH PROBABILITY
BE ATTRIBUTED TO HIM
IN THIS PLATO WAS ONLY FOLLOWING THE COMMON
THOUGHT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHICH HE EMBELLISHED AND EXAGGERATED WITH ALL
THE POWER OF HIS GENIUS
THERE IS NO NEED TO SUPPOSE THAT HE DREW
FROM LIFE OR THAT HIS KNOWLEDGE OF TYRANTS IS DERIVED FROM A PERSONAL
ACQUAINTANCE WITH DIONYSIUS
THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SPEAKS OF THEM WOULD
RATHER TEND TO RENDER DOUBTFUL HIS EVER HAVING 'CONSORTED' WITH THEM OR
ENTERTAINED THE SCHEMES WHICH ARE ATTRIBUTED TO HIM IN THE EPISTLES OF
REGENERATING SICILY BY THEIR HELP
PLATO IN A HYPERBOLICAL AND SERIO COMIC VEIN EXAGGERATES THE FOLLIES OF
DEMOCRACY WHICH HE ALSO SEES REFLECTED IN SOCIAL LIFE
TO HIM DEMOCRACY
IS A STATE OF INDIVIDUALISM OR DISSOLUTION IN WHICH EVERY ONE IS DOING
WHAT IS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES
OF A PEOPLE ANIMATED BY A COMMON SPIRIT
OF LIBERTY RISING AS ONE MAN TO REPEL THE PERSIAN HOST WHICH IS THE
LEADING IDEA OF DEMOCRACY IN HERODOTUS AND THUCYDIDES HE NEVER SEEMS TO
THINK
BUT IF HE IS NOT A BELIEVER IN LIBERTY STILL LESS IS HE A LOVER
OF TYRANNY
HIS DEEPER AND MORE SERIOUS CONDEMNATION IS RESERVED FOR THE
TYRANT WHO IS THE IDEAL OF WICKEDNESS AND ALSO OF WEAKNESS AND WHO
IN HIS UTTER HELPLESSNESS AND SUSPICIOUSNESS IS LEADING AN ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE EXISTENCE WITHOUT THAT REMNANT OF GOOD WHICH IN PLATO'S
OPINION WAS REQUIRED TO GIVE POWER TO EVIL BOOK I
THIS IDEAL OF
WICKEDNESS LIVING IN HELPLESS MISERY IS THE REVERSE OF THAT OTHER
PORTRAIT OF PERFECT INJUSTICE RULING IN HAPPINESS AND SPLENDOUR WHICH
FIRST OF ALL THRASYMACHUS AND AFTERWARDS THE SONS OF ARISTON HAD DRAWN
AND IS ALSO THE REVERSE OF THE KING WHOSE RULE OF LIFE IS THE GOOD OF
HIS SUBJECTS
EACH OF THESE GOVERNMENTS AND INDIVIDUALS HAS A CORRESPONDING
ETHICAL GRADATION THE IDEAL STATE IS UNDER THE RULE OF REASON NOT
EXTINGUISHING BUT HARMONIZING THE PASSIONS AND TRAINING THEM IN VIRTUE
IN THE TIMOCRACY AND THE TIMOCRATIC MAN THE CONSTITUTION WHETHER OF THE
STATE OR OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS BASED FIRST UPON COURAGE AND SECONDLY
UPON THE LOVE OF HONOUR THIS LATTER VIRTUE WHICH IS HARDLY TO BE
ESTEEMED A VIRTUE HAS SUPERSEDED ALL THE REST
IN THE SECOND STAGE OF
DECLINE THE VIRTUES HAVE ALTOGETHER DISAPPEARED AND THE LOVE OF GAIN
HAS SUCCEEDED TO THEM IN THE THIRD STAGE OR DEMOCRACY THE VARIOUS
PASSIONS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE FREE PLAY AND THE VIRTUES AND VICES ARE
IMPARTIALLY CULTIVATED
BUT THIS FREEDOM WHICH LEADS TO MANY CURIOUS
EXTRAVAGANCES OF CHARACTER IS IN REALITY ONLY A STATE OF WEAKNESS AND
DISSIPATION
AT LAST ONE MONSTER PASSION TAKES POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE
NATURE OF MAN THIS IS TYRANNY
IN ALL OF THEM EXCESS THE EXCESS FIRST
OF WEALTH AND THEN OF FREEDOM IS THE ELEMENT OF DECAY
THE EIGHTH BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC ABOUNDS IN PICTURES OF LIFE AND FANCIFUL
ALLUSIONS THE USE OF METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE IS CARRIED TO A GREATER
EXTENT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN PLATO
WE MAY REMARK
1 THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TWO NATIONS IN ONE WHICH BECOME MORE AND
MORE DIVIDED IN THE GREEK REPUBLICS AS IN FEUDAL TIMES AND PERHAPS
ALSO IN OUR OWN
2 THE NOTION OF DEMOCRACY EXPRESSED IN A SORT OF PYTHAGOREAN FORMULA
AS EQUALITY AMONG UNEQUALS
3 THE FREE AND EASY WAYS OF MEN AND ANIMALS WHICH ARE CHARACTERISTIC
OF LIBERTY AS FOREIGN MERCENARIES AND UNIVERSAL MISTRUST ARE OF THE
TYRANT
4 THE PROPOSAL THAT MERE DEBTS SHOULD NOT BE RECOVERABLE BY LAW IS A
SPECULATION WHICH HAS OFTEN BEEN ENTERTAINED BY REFORMERS OF THE LAW
IN MODERN TIMES AND IS IN HARMONY WITH THE TENDENCIES OF MODERN
LEGISLATION
DEBT AND LAND WERE THE TWO GREAT DIFFICULTIES OF THE
ANCIENT LAWGIVER IN MODERN TIMES WE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE ALMOST IF NOT
QUITE SOLVED THE FIRST OF THESE DIFFICULTIES BUT HARDLY THE SECOND
STILL MORE REMARKABLE ARE THE CORRESPONDING PORTRAITS OF INDIVIDUALS
THERE IS THE FAMILY PICTURE OF THE FATHER AND MOTHER AND THE OLD SERVANT
OF THE TIMOCRATICAL MAN AND THE OUTWARD RESPECTABILITY AND INHERENT
MEANNESS OF THE OLIGARCHICAL THE UNCONTROLLED LICENCE AND FREEDOM OF
THE DEMOCRAT IN WHICH THE YOUNG ALCIBIADES SEEMS TO BE DEPICTED DOING
RIGHT OR WRONG AS HE PLEASES AND WHO AT LAST LIKE THE PRODIGAL
GOES INTO A FAR COUNTRY NOTE HERE THE PLAY OF LANGUAGE BY WHICH THE
DEMOCRATIC MAN IS HIMSELF REPRESENTED UNDER THE IMAGE OF A STATE HAVING
A CITADEL AND RECEIVING EMBASSIES AND THERE IS THE WILD BEAST NATURE
WHICH BREAKS LOOSE IN HIS SUCCESSOR
THE HIT ABOUT THE TYRANT BEING A
PARRICIDE THE REPRESENTATION OF THE TYRANT'S LIFE AS AN OBSCENE DREAM
THE RHETORICAL SURPRISE OF A MORE MISERABLE THAN THE MOST MISERABLE OF
MEN IN BOOK IX THE HINT TO THE POETS THAT IF THEY ARE THE FRIENDS OF
TYRANTS THERE IS NO PLACE FOR THEM IN A CONSTITUTIONAL STATE AND THAT
THEY ARE TOO CLEVER NOT TO SEE THE PROPRIETY OF THEIR OWN EXPULSION THE
CONTINUOUS IMAGE OF THE DRONES WHO ARE OF TWO KINDS SWELLING AT LAST
INTO THE MONSTER DRONE HAVING WINGS BOOK IX ARE AMONG PLATO'S
HAPPIEST TOUCHES
THERE REMAINS TO BE CONSIDERED THE GREAT DIFFICULTY OF THIS BOOK OF THE
REPUBLIC THE SO CALLED NUMBER OF THE STATE
THIS IS A PUZZLE ALMOST AS
GREAT AS THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION AND THOUGH
APPARENTLY KNOWN TO ARISTOTLE IS REFERRED TO BY CICERO AS A PROVERB OF
OBSCURITY EP
AD ATT
AND SOME HAVE IMAGINED THAT THERE IS NO ANSWER
TO THE PUZZLE AND THAT PLATO HAS BEEN PRACTISING UPON HIS READERS
BUT SUCH A DECEPTION AS THIS IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH
ARISTOTLE SPEAKS OF THE NUMBER POL AND WOULD HAVE BEEN RIDICULOUS TO
ANY READER OF THE REPUBLIC WHO WAS ACQUAINTED WITH GREEK MATHEMATICS
AS LITTLE REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THAT PLATO INTENTIONALLY USED
OBSCURE EXPRESSIONS THE OBSCURITY ARISES FROM OUR WANT OF FAMILIARITY
WITH THE SUBJECT
ON THE OTHER HAND PLATO HIMSELF INDICATES THAT HE IS
NOT ALTOGETHER SERIOUS AND IN DESCRIBING HIS NUMBER AS A SOLEMN JEST OF
THE MUSES HE APPEARS TO IMPLY SOME DEGREE OF SATIRE ON THE SYMBOLICAL
USE OF NUMBER
COMPARE CRATYLUS PROTAG
OUR HOPE OF UNDERSTANDING THE PASSAGE DEPENDS PRINCIPALLY ON AN ACCURATE
STUDY OF THE WORDS THEMSELVES ON WHICH A FAINT LIGHT IS THROWN BY THE
PARALLEL PASSAGE IN THE NINTH BOOK
ANOTHER HELP IS THE ALLUSION IN
ARISTOTLE WHO MAKES THE IMPORTANT REMARK THAT THE LATTER PART OF THE
PASSAGE GREEK DESCRIBES A SOLID FIGURE
POL 'HE ONLY SAYS THAT
NOTHING IS ABIDING BUT THAT ALL THINGS CHANGE IN A CERTAIN CYCLE AND
THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE CHANGE IS A BASE OF NUMBERS WHICH ARE IN THE
RATIO OF 4 3 AND THIS WHEN COMBINED WITH A FIGURE OF FIVE GIVES TWO
HARMONIES HE MEANS WHEN THE NUMBER OF THIS FIGURE BECOMES SOLID
SOME FURTHER CLUE MAY BE GATHERED FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE PYTHAGOREAN
TRIANGLE WHICH IS DENOTED BY THE NUMBERS 3 4 5 AND IN WHICH AS IN
EVERY RIGHT ANGLED TRIANGLE THE SQUARES OF THE TWO LESSER SIDES EQUAL
THE SQUARE OF THE HYPOTENUSE 9 16 25
PLATO BEGINS BY SPEAKING OF A PERFECT OR CYCLICAL NUMBER TIM I E
A NUMBER IN WHICH THE SUM OF THE DIVISORS EQUALS THE WHOLE THIS IS THE
DIVINE OR PERFECT NUMBER IN WHICH ALL LESSER CYCLES OR REVOLUTIONS ARE
COMPLETE
HE ALSO SPEAKS OF A HUMAN OR IMPERFECT NUMBER HAVING FOUR
TERMS AND THREE INTERVALS OF NUMBERS WHICH ARE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER IN
CERTAIN PROPORTIONS THESE HE CONVERTS INTO FIGURES AND FINDS IN
THEM WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN RAISED TO THE THIRD POWER CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF
NUMBER WHICH GIVE TWO 'HARMONIES THE ONE SQUARE THE OTHER OBLONG
BUT HE DOES NOT SAY THAT THE SQUARE NUMBER ANSWERS TO THE DIVINE OR THE
OBLONG NUMBER TO THE HUMAN CYCLE NOR IS ANY INTIMATION GIVEN THAT THE
FIRST OR DIVINE NUMBER REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF THE WORLD THE SECOND
THE PERIOD OF THE STATE OR OF THE HUMAN RACE AS ZELLER SUPPOSES NOR
IS THE DIVINE NUMBER AFTERWARDS MENTIONED ARIST
THE SECOND IS THE
NUMBER OF GENERATIONS OR BIRTHS AND PRESIDES OVER THEM IN THE SAME
MYSTERIOUS MANNER IN WHICH THE STARS PRESIDE OVER THEM OR IN WHICH
ACCORDING TO THE PYTHAGOREANS OPPORTUNITY JUSTICE MARRIAGE ARE
REPRESENTED BY SOME NUMBER OR FIGURE
THIS IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER 216
THE EXPLANATION GIVEN IN THE TEXT SUPPOSES THE TWO HARMONIES TO MAKE UP
THE NUMBER 8000
THIS EXPLANATION DERIVES A CERTAIN PLAUSIBILITY FROM
THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT 8000 IS THE ANCIENT NUMBER OF THE SPARTAN CITIZENS
HEROD AND WOULD BE WHAT PLATO MIGHT HAVE CALLED 'A NUMBER WHICH
NEARLY CONCERNS THE POPULATION OF A CITY' THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE
OF THE SPARTAN POPULATION MAY POSSIBLY HAVE SUGGESTED TO HIM THE FIRST
CAUSE OF HIS DECLINE OF STATES
THE LESSER OR SQUARE 'HARMONY OF 400
MIGHT BE A SYMBOL OF THE GUARDIANS THE LARGER OR OBLONG 'HARMONY
OF THE PEOPLE AND THE NUMBERS 3 4 5 MIGHT REFER RESPECTIVELY TO THE
THREE ORDERS IN THE STATE OR PARTS OF THE SOUL THE FOUR VIRTUES THE
FIVE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
THE HARMONY OF THE MUSICAL SCALE WHICH
IS ELSEWHERE USED AS A SYMBOL OF THE HARMONY OF THE STATE IS ALSO
INDICATED
FOR THE NUMBERS 3 4 5 WHICH REPRESENT THE SIDES OF THE
PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLE ALSO DENOTE THE INTERVALS OF THE SCALE
THE TERMS USED IN THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM MAY BE EXPLAINED AS
FOLLOWS
A PERFECT NUMBER GREEK AS ALREADY STATED IS ONE WHICH IS
EQUAL TO THE SUM OF ITS DIVISORS
THUS 6 WHICH IS THE FIRST PERFECT OR
CYCLICAL NUMBER 1 2 3
THE WORDS GREEK 'TERMS' OR 'NOTES AND
GREEK 'INTERVALS ARE APPLICABLE TO MUSIC AS WELL AS TO NUMBER AND
FIGURE
GREEK IS THE 'BASE' ON WHICH THE WHOLE CALCULATION DEPENDS
OR THE 'LOWEST TERM' FROM WHICH IT CAN BE WORKED OUT
THE WORDS GREEK
HAVE BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED 'SQUARED AND CUBED' DONALDSON
'EQUALLING AND EQUALLED IN POWER' WEBER 'BY INVOLUTION AND
EVOLUTION I E

THE TRANSLATION

'DECREASING' GREEK ARE THOSE WHICH SUCCEED THE SUM OF THEIR DIVISORS

THE WORDS TRANSLATED 'COMMENSURABLE

DESCRIBING THE SAME RELATION WITH MORE OR LESS PRECISION
THEY ARE
EQUIVALENT TO 'EXPRESSIBLE IN TERMS HAVING THE SAME RELATION TO ONE

49 IS A SQUARE OF THE RATIONAL DIAMETER OF A

FOR SEVERAL OF THE EXPLANATIONS HERE GIVEN AND FOR A GOOD DEAL BESIDES
I AM INDEBTED TO AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE ON THE PLATONIC NUMBER BY DR
DONALDSON PROC
OF THE PHILOL
SOCIETY
THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH HE DRAWS FROM THESE DATA ARE SUMMED UP BY HIM AS
FOLLOWS
HAVING ASSUMED THAT THE NUMBER OF THE PERFECT OR DIVINE CYCLE
IS THE NUMBER OF THE WORLD AND THE NUMBER OF THE IMPERFECT CYCLE THE
NUMBER OF THE STATE HE PROCEEDS 'THE PERIOD OF THE WORLD IS DEFINED
BY THE PERFECT NUMBER 6 THAT OF THE STATE BY THE CUBE OF THAT NUMBER
OR 216 WHICH IS THE PRODUCT OF THE LAST PAIR OF TERMS IN THE PLATONIC
TETRACTYS A SERIES OF SEVEN TERMS 1 2 3 4 9 8 27 AND IF
WE TAKE THIS AS THE BASIS OF OUR COMPUTATION WE SHALL HAVE TWO CUBE
NUMBERS GREEK VIZ
8 AND 27 AND THE MEAN PROPORTIONALS BETWEEN
THESE VIZ
12 AND 18 WILL FURNISH THREE INTERVALS AND FOUR TERMS
AND THESE TERMS AND INTERVALS STAND RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE
SESQUI ALTERA RATIO I E
EACH TERM IS TO THE PRECEDING AS 3 2
NOW IF
WE REMEMBER THAT THE NUMBER 216 8 X 27 3 CUBED 4 CUBED 5 CUBED
AND 3 SQUARED 4 SQUARED 5 SQUARED WE MUST ADMIT THAT THIS
NUMBER IMPLIES THE NUMBERS 3 4 5 TO WHICH MUSICIANS ATTACH SO MUCH
IMPORTANCE
AND IF WE COMBINE THE RATIO 4 3 WITH THE NUMBER 5 OR
MULTIPLY THE RATIOS OF THE SIDES BY THE HYPOTENUSE WE SHALL BY FIRST
SQUARING AND THEN CUBING OBTAIN TWO EXPRESSIONS WHICH DENOTE THE RATIO
OF THE TWO LAST PAIRS OF TERMS IN THE PLATONIC TETRACTYS THE FORMER
MULTIPLIED BY THE SQUARE THE LATTER BY THE CUBE OF THE NUMBER 10 THE
SUM OF THE FIRST FOUR DIGITS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE PLATONIC TETRACTYS
THE TWO GREEK HE ELSEWHERE EXPLAINS AS FOLLOWS 'THE FIRST GREEK IS
GREEK IN OTHER WORDS 4 3 X 5 ALL SQUARED 100 X 2 SQUARED OVER 3
SQUARED
THE SECOND GREEK A CUBE OF THE SAME ROOT IS DESCRIBED
AS 100 MULTIPLIED ALPHA BY THE RATIONAL DIAMETER OF 5 DIMINISHED

DIAMETERS I E
THE TWO FIRST IRRATIONALS OR 2 AND 3 AND GAMMA BY
THE CUBE OF 3 OR 27
THUS WE HAVE 48 5 27 100 1000 X 2 CUBED
THIS SECOND HARMONY IS TO BE THE CUBE OF THE NUMBER OF WHICH THE FORMER
HARMONY IS THE SQUARE AND THEREFORE MUST BE DIVIDED BY THE CUBE OF
3
IN OTHER WORDS THE WHOLE EXPRESSION WILL BE 1 FOR THE FIRST
HARMONY 400 9 2 FOR THE SECOND HARMONY 8000 27
THE REASONS WHICH HAVE INCLINED ME TO AGREE WITH DR
DONALDSON AND ALSO
WITH SCHLEIERMACHER IN SUPPOSING THAT 216 IS THE PLATONIC NUMBER OF
BIRTHS ARE 1 THAT IT COINCIDES WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THE NUMBER
GIVEN IN THE FIRST PART OF THE PASSAGE GREEK 2 THAT THE
NUMBER 216 WITH ITS PERMUTATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR TO A GREEK
MATHEMATICIAN THOUGH UNFAMILIAR TO US 3 THAT 216 IS THE CUBE OF
6 AND ALSO THE SUM OF 3 CUBED 4 CUBED 5 CUBED THE NUMBERS 3 4 5
REPRESENTING THE PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLE OF WHICH THE SIDES WHEN SQUARED
EQUAL THE SQUARE OF THE HYPOTENUSE 9 16 25 4 THAT IT IS ALSO
THE PERIOD OF THE PYTHAGOREAN METEMPSYCHOSIS 5 THE THREE ULTIMATE
TERMS OR BASES 3 4 5 OF WHICH 216 IS COMPOSED ANSWER TO THE THIRD
FOURTH FIFTH IN THE MUSICAL SCALE 6 THAT THE NUMBER 216 IS THE
PRODUCT OF THE CUBES OF 2 AND 3 WHICH ARE THE TWO LAST TERMS IN
THE PLATONIC TETRACTYS 7 THAT THE PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLE IS SAID BY
PLUTARCH DE IS
ET OSIR PROCLUS SUPER PRIMA EUCL AND QUINTILIAN
DE MUSICA TO BE CONTAINED IN THIS PASSAGE SO THAT THE TRADITION
OF THE SCHOOL SEEMS TO POINT IN THE SAME DIRECTION 8 THAT THE
PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLE IS CALLED ALSO THE FIGURE OF MARRIAGE GREEK
BUT THOUGH AGREEING WITH DR
DONALDSON THUS FAR I SEE NO REASON FOR
SUPPOSING AS HE DOES THAT THE FIRST OR PERFECT NUMBER IS THE WORLD
THE HUMAN OR IMPERFECT NUMBER THE STATE NOR HAS HE GIVEN ANY PROOF THAT
THE SECOND HARMONY IS A CUBE
NOR DO I THINK THAT GREEK CAN MEAN
'TWO INCOMMENSURABLES WHICH HE ARBITRARILY ASSUMES TO BE 2 AND 3
BUT RATHER AS THE PRECEDING CLAUSE IMPLIES GREEK I E
TWO SQUARE
NUMBERS BASED UPON IRRATIONAL DIAMETERS OF A FIGURE THE SIDE OF WHICH IS
5 50 X 2
THE GREATEST OBJECTION TO THE TRANSLATION IS THE SENSE GIVEN TO THE
WORDS GREEK 'A BASE OF THREE WITH A THIRD ADDED TO IT MULTIPLIED
BY 5 IN THIS SOMEWHAT FORCED MANNER PLATO INTRODUCES ONCE MORE THE
NUMBERS OF THE PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLE
BUT THE COINCIDENCES IN THE NUMBERS
WHICH FOLLOW ARE IN FAVOUR OF THE EXPLANATION
THE FIRST HARMONY OF 400
AS HAS BEEN ALREADY REMARKED PROBABLY REPRESENTS THE RULERS THE SECOND
AND OBLONG HARMONY OF 7600 THE PEOPLE
AND HERE WE TAKE LEAVE OF THE DIFFICULTY
THE DISCOVERY OF THE RIDDLE
WOULD BE USELESS AND WOULD THROW NO LIGHT ON ANCIENT MATHEMATICS
THE
POINT OF INTEREST IS THAT PLATO SHOULD HAVE USED SUCH A SYMBOL AND
THAT SO MUCH OF THE PYTHAGOREAN SPIRIT SHOULD HAVE PREVAILED IN HIM
HIS
GENERAL MEANING IS THAT DIVINE CREATION IS PERFECT AND IS REPRESENTED
OR PRESIDED OVER BY A PERFECT OR CYCLICAL NUMBER HUMAN GENERATION IS
IMPERFECT AND REPRESENTED OR PRESIDED OVER BY AN IMPERFECT NUMBER OR
SERIES OF NUMBERS
THE NUMBER 5040 WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF THE CITIZENS
IN THE LAWS IS EXPRESSLY BASED BY HIM ON UTILITARIAN GROUNDS NAMELY
THE CONVENIENCE OF THE NUMBER FOR DIVISION IT IS ALSO MADE UP OF
THE FIRST SEVEN DIGITS MULTIPLIED BY ONE ANOTHER
THE CONTRAST OF THE
PERFECT AND IMPERFECT NUMBER MAY HAVE BEEN EASILY SUGGESTED BY THE
CORRECTIONS OF THE CYCLE WHICH WERE MADE FIRST BY METON AND SECONDLY
BY CALLIPPUS THE LATTER IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN A PUPIL OF PLATO
OF THE
DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE OR OF EXACTNESS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM
THE NUMBER OF THE TYRANT IN BOOK IX 729 365 X 2 AND THE SLIGHT
CORRECTION OF THE ERROR IN THE NUMBER 5040 12 LAWS MAY FURNISH A
CRITERION
THERE IS NOTHING SURPRISING IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THOSE
WHO WERE SEEKING FOR ORDER IN NATURE AND HAD FOUND ORDER IN NUMBER
SHOULD HAVE IMAGINED ONE TO GIVE LAW TO THE OTHER
PLATO BELIEVES IN
A POWER OF NUMBER FAR BEYOND WHAT HE COULD SEE REALIZED IN THE WORLD
AROUND HIM AND HE KNOWS THE GREAT INFLUENCE WHICH 'THE LITTLE MATTER
OF 1 2 3' EXERCISES UPON EDUCATION
HE MAY EVEN BE THOUGHT TO HAVE A
PROPHETIC ANTICIPATION OF THE DISCOVERIES OF QUETELET AND OTHERS THAT
NUMBERS DEPEND UPON NUMBERS E G IN POPULATION THE NUMBERS OF BIRTHS
AND THE RESPECTIVE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN BORN OF EITHER SEX ON THE
RESPECTIVE AGES OF PARENTS I E
ON OTHER NUMBERS
BOOK IX
LAST OF ALL COMES THE TYRANNICAL MAN ABOUT WHOM WE HAVE TO
ENQUIRE WHENCE IS HE AND HOW DOES HE LIVE IN HAPPINESS OR IN MISERY
THERE IS HOWEVER A PREVIOUS QUESTION OF THE NATURE AND NUMBER OF
THE APPETITES WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO CONSIDER FIRST
SOME OF THEM
ARE UNLAWFUL AND YET ADMIT OF BEING CHASTENED AND WEAKENED IN VARIOUS
DEGREES BY THE POWER OF REASON AND LAW
'WHAT APPETITES DO YOU MEAN I
MEAN THOSE WHICH ARE AWAKE WHEN THE REASONING POWERS ARE ASLEEP WHICH
GET UP AND WALK ABOUT NAKED WITHOUT ANY SELF RESPECT OR SHAME AND THERE
IS NO CONCEIVABLE FOLLY OR CRIME HOWEVER CRUEL OR UNNATURAL OF WHICH
IN IMAGINATION THEY MAY NOT BE GUILTY
'TRUE HE SAID 'VERY TRUE
BUT WHEN A MAN'S PULSE BEATS TEMPERATELY AND HE HAS SUPPED ON A FEAST
OF REASON AND COME TO A KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF BEFORE GOING TO REST AND
HAS SATISFIED HIS DESIRES JUST ENOUGH TO PREVENT THEIR PERTURBING HIS
REASON WHICH REMAINS CLEAR AND LUMINOUS AND WHEN HE IS FREE FROM
QUARREL AND HEAT THE VISIONS WHICH HE HAS ON HIS BED ARE LEAST
IRREGULAR AND ABNORMAL
EVEN IN GOOD MEN THERE IS SUCH AN IRREGULAR
WILD BEAST NATURE WHICH PEERS OUT IN SLEEP
TO RETURN YOU REMEMBER WHAT WAS SAID OF THE DEMOCRAT THAT HE WAS THE
SON OF A MISERLY FATHER WHO ENCOURAGED THE SAVING DESIRES AND REPRESSED
THE ORNAMENTAL AND EXPENSIVE ONES PRESENTLY THE YOUTH GOT INTO FINE
COMPANY AND BEGAN TO ENTERTAIN A DISLIKE TO HIS FATHER'S NARROW WAYS
AND BEING A BETTER MAN THAN THE CORRUPTERS OF HIS YOUTH HE CAME TO A
MEAN AND LED A LIFE NOT OF LAWLESS OR SLAVISH PASSION BUT OF REGULAR
AND SUCCESSIVE INDULGENCE
NOW IMAGINE THAT THE YOUTH HAS BECOME A
FATHER AND HAS A SON WHO IS EXPOSED TO THE SAME TEMPTATIONS AND HAS
COMPANIONS WHO LEAD HIM INTO EVERY SORT OF INIQUITY AND PARENTS AND
FRIENDS WHO TRY TO KEEP HIM RIGHT
THE COUNSELLORS OF EVIL FIND THAT
THEIR ONLY CHANCE OF RETAINING HIM IS TO IMPLANT IN HIS SOUL A MONSTER
DRONE OR LOVE WHILE OTHER DESIRES BUZZ AROUND HIM AND MYSTIFY HIM WITH
SWEET SOUNDS AND SCENTS THIS MONSTER LOVE TAKES POSSESSION OF HIM
AND PUTS AN END TO EVERY TRUE OR MODEST THOUGHT OR WISH
LOVE LIKE
DRUNKENNESS AND MADNESS IS A TYRANNY AND THE TYRANNICAL MAN WHETHER
MADE BY NATURE OR HABIT IS JUST A DRINKING LUSTING FURIOUS SORT OF
ANIMAL
AND HOW DOES SUCH AN ONE LIVE 'NAY THAT YOU MUST TELL ME WELL THEN
I FANCY THAT HE WILL LIVE AMID REVELRIES AND HARLOTRIES AND LOVE WILL
BE THE LORD AND MASTER OF THE HOUSE
MANY DESIRES REQUIRE MUCH MONEY
AND SO HE SPENDS ALL THAT HE HAS AND BORROWS MORE AND WHEN HE HAS
NOTHING THE YOUNG RAVENS ARE STILL IN THE NEST IN WHICH THEY WERE
HATCHED CRYING FOR FOOD
LOVE URGES THEM ON AND THEY MUST BE GRATIFIED
BY FORCE OR FRAUD OR IF NOT THEY BECOME PAINFUL AND TROUBLESOME
AND AS THE NEW PLEASURES SUCCEED THE OLD ONES SO WILL THE SON TAKE
POSSESSION OF THE GOODS OF HIS PARENTS IF THEY SHOW SIGNS OF REFUSING
HE WILL DEFRAUD AND DECEIVE THEM AND IF THEY OPENLY RESIST WHAT THEN
'I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I SHOULD NOT MUCH LIKE TO BE IN THEIR PLACE
BUT O HEAVENS ADEIMANTUS TO THINK THAT FOR SOME NEW FANGLED AND
UNNECESSARY LOVE HE WILL GIVE UP HIS OLD FATHER AND MOTHER BEST AND
DEAREST OF FRIENDS OR ENSLAVE THEM TO THE FANCIES OF THE HOUR TRULY A
TYRANNICAL SON IS A BLESSING TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER WHEN THERE IS NO
MORE TO BE GOT OUT OF THEM HE TURNS BURGLAR OR PICKPOCKET OR ROBS A
TEMPLE
LOVE OVERMASTERS THE THOUGHTS OF HIS YOUTH AND HE BECOMES
IN SOBER REALITY THE MONSTER THAT HE WAS SOMETIMES IN SLEEP
HE WAXES
STRONG IN ALL VIOLENCE AND LAWLESSNESS AND IS READY FOR ANY DEED OF
DARING THAT WILL SUPPLY THE WANTS OF HIS RABBLE ROUT
IN A WELL ORDERED
STATE THERE ARE ONLY A FEW SUCH AND THESE IN TIME OF WAR GO OUT AND
BECOME THE MERCENARIES OF A TYRANT
BUT IN TIME OF PEACE THEY STAY
AT HOME AND DO MISCHIEF THEY ARE THE THIEVES FOOTPADS CUT PURSES
MAN STEALERS OF THE COMMUNITY OR IF THEY ARE ABLE TO SPEAK THEY TURN
FALSE WITNESSES AND INFORMERS
'NO SMALL CATALOGUE OF CRIMES TRULY
EVEN IF THE PERPETRATORS ARE FEW YES I SAID BUT SMALL AND GREAT ARE
RELATIVE TERMS AND NO CRIMES WHICH ARE COMMITTED BY THEM APPROACH THOSE
OF THE TYRANT WHOM THIS CLASS GROWING STRONG AND NUMEROUS CREATE OUT
OF THEMSELVES
IF THE PEOPLE YIELD WELL AND GOOD BUT IF THEY RESIST
THEN AS BEFORE HE BEAT HIS FATHER AND MOTHER SO NOW HE BEATS HIS
FATHERLAND AND MOTHERLAND AND PLACES HIS MERCENARIES OVER THEM
SUCH
MEN IN THEIR EARLY DAYS LIVE WITH FLATTERERS AND THEY THEMSELVES
FLATTER OTHERS IN ORDER TO GAIN THEIR ENDS BUT THEY SOON DISCARD THEIR
FOLLOWERS WHEN THEY HAVE NO LONGER ANY NEED OF THEM THEY ARE ALWAYS
EITHER MASTERS OR SERVANTS THE JOYS OF FRIENDSHIP ARE UNKNOWN TO THEM
AND THEY ARE UTTERLY TREACHEROUS AND UNJUST IF THE NATURE OF JUSTICE BE
AT ALL UNDERSTOOD BY US
THEY REALIZE OUR DREAM AND HE WHO IS THE MOST
OF A TYRANT BY NATURE AND LEADS THE LIFE OF A TYRANT FOR THE LONGEST
TIME WILL BE THE WORST OF THEM AND BEING THE WORST OF THEM WILL ALSO
BE THE MOST MISERABLE
LIKE MAN LIKE STATE THE TYRANNICAL MAN WILL ANSWER TO TYRANNY WHICH
IS THE EXTREME OPPOSITE OF THE ROYAL STATE FOR ONE IS THE BEST AND THE
OTHER THE WORST
BUT WHICH IS THE HAPPIER GREAT AND TERRIBLE AS THE
TYRANT MAY APPEAR ENTHRONED AMID HIS SATELLITES LET US NOT BE AFRAID TO
GO IN AND ASK AND THE ANSWER IS THAT THE MONARCHICAL IS THE HAPPIEST
AND THE TYRANNICAL THE MOST MISERABLE OF STATES
AND MAY WE NOT ASK THE
SAME QUESTION ABOUT THE MEN THEMSELVES REQUESTING SOME ONE TO LOOK INTO
THEM WHO IS ABLE TO PENETRATE THE INNER NATURE OF MAN AND WILL NOT BE
PANIC STRUCK BY THE VAIN POMP OF TYRANNY I WILL SUPPOSE THAT HE IS ONE
WHO HAS LIVED WITH HIM AND HAS SEEN HIM IN FAMILY LIFE OR PERHAPS IN
THE HOUR OF TROUBLE AND DANGER
ASSUMING THAT WE OURSELVES ARE THE IMPARTIAL JUDGE FOR WHOM WE SEEK LET
US BEGIN BY COMPARING THE INDIVIDUAL AND STATE AND ASK FIRST OF ALL
WHETHER THE STATE IS LIKELY TO BE FREE OR ENSLAVED WILL THERE NOT BE
A LITTLE FREEDOM AND A GREAT DEAL OF SLAVERY AND THE FREEDOM IS OF THE
BAD AND THE SLAVERY OF THE GOOD AND THIS APPLIES TO THE MAN AS WELL
AS TO THE STATE FOR HIS SOUL IS FULL OF MEANNESS AND SLAVERY AND THE
BETTER PART IS ENSLAVED TO THE WORSE
HE CANNOT DO WHAT HE WOULD AND
HIS MIND IS FULL OF CONFUSION HE IS THE VERY REVERSE OF A FREEMAN
THE
STATE WILL BE POOR AND FULL OF MISERY AND SORROW AND THE MAN'S SOUL
WILL ALSO BE POOR AND FULL OF SORROWS AND HE WILL BE THE MOST MISERABLE
OF MEN
NO NOT THE MOST MISERABLE FOR THERE IS YET A MORE MISERABLE
'WHO IS THAT THE TYRANNICAL MAN WHO HAS THE MISFORTUNE ALSO TO BECOME
A PUBLIC TYRANT
'THERE I SUSPECT THAT YOU ARE RIGHT SAY RATHER 'I
AM SURE CONJECTURE IS OUT OF PLACE IN AN ENQUIRY OF THIS NATURE
HE
IS LIKE A WEALTHY OWNER OF SLAVES ONLY HE HAS MORE OF THEM THAN
ANY PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL
YOU WILL SAY 'THE OWNERS OF SLAVES ARE NOT
GENERALLY IN ANY FEAR OF THEM BUT WHY BECAUSE THE WHOLE CITY IS IN A
LEAGUE WHICH PROTECTS THE INDIVIDUAL
SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT ONE OF THESE
OWNERS AND HIS HOUSEHOLD IS CARRIED OFF BY A GOD INTO A WILDERNESS
WHERE THERE ARE NO FREEMEN TO HELP HIM WILL HE NOT BE IN AN AGONY OF
TERROR WILL HE NOT BE COMPELLED TO FLATTER HIS SLAVES AND TO PROMISE
THEM MANY THINGS SORE AGAINST HIS WILL AND SUPPOSE THE SAME GOD WHO
CARRIED HIM OFF WERE TO SURROUND HIM WITH NEIGHBOURS WHO DECLARE THAT NO
MAN OUGHT TO HAVE SLAVES AND THAT THE OWNERS OF THEM SHOULD BE PUNISHED
WITH DEATH
'STILL WORSE AND WORSE HE WILL BE IN THE MIDST OF HIS
ENEMIES AND IS NOT OUR TYRANT SUCH A CAPTIVE SOUL WHO IS TORMENTED BY
A SWARM OF PASSIONS WHICH HE CANNOT INDULGE LIVING INDOORS ALWAYS LIKE
A WOMAN AND JEALOUS OF THOSE WHO CAN GO OUT AND SEE THE WORLD
HAVING SO MANY EVILS WILL NOT THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BE STILL MORE
MISERABLE IN A PUBLIC STATION MASTER OF OTHERS WHEN HE IS NOT MASTER OF
HIMSELF LIKE A SICK MAN WHO IS COMPELLED TO BE AN ATHLETE THE MEANEST
OF SLAVES AND THE MOST ABJECT OF FLATTERERS WANTING ALL THINGS AND
NEVER ABLE TO SATISFY HIS DESIRES ALWAYS IN FEAR AND DISTRACTION
LIKE THE STATE OF WHICH HE IS THE REPRESENTATIVE
HIS JEALOUS
HATEFUL FAITHLESS TEMPER GROWS WORSE WITH COMMAND HE IS MORE AND MORE
FAITHLESS ENVIOUS UNRIGHTEOUS THE MOST WRETCHED OF MEN A MISERY
TO HIMSELF AND TO OTHERS
AND SO LET US HAVE A FINAL TRIAL AND
PROCLAMATION NEED WE HIRE A HERALD OR SHALL I PROCLAIM THE RESULT
'MADE THE PROCLAMATION YOURSELF THE SON OF ARISTON THE BEST IS OF
OPINION THAT THE BEST AND JUSTEST OF MEN IS ALSO THE HAPPIEST AND THAT
THIS IS HE WHO IS THE MOST ROYAL MASTER OF HIMSELF AND THAT THE UNJUST
MAN IS HE WHO IS THE GREATEST TYRANT OF HIMSELF AND OF HIS STATE
AND I
ADD FURTHER 'SEEN OR UNSEEN BY GODS OR MEN
THIS IS OUR FIRST PROOF
THE SECOND IS DERIVED FROM THE THREE KINDS
OF PLEASURE WHICH ANSWER TO THE THREE ELEMENTS OF THE SOUL REASON
PASSION DESIRE UNDER WHICH LAST IS COMPREHENDED AVARICE AS WELL AS
SENSUAL APPETITE WHILE PASSION INCLUDES AMBITION PARTY FEELING LOVE
OF REPUTATION
REASON AGAIN IS SOLELY DIRECTED TO THE ATTAINMENT OF
TRUTH AND CARELESS OF MONEY AND REPUTATION
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
DIFFERENCE OF MEN'S NATURES ONE OF THESE THREE PRINCIPLES IS IN THE
ASCENDANT AND THEY HAVE THEIR SEVERAL PLEASURES CORRESPONDING TO THEM
INTERROGATE NOW THE THREE NATURES AND EACH ONE WILL BE FOUND PRAISING
HIS OWN PLEASURES AND DEPRECIATING THOSE OF OTHERS
THE MONEY MAKER WILL
CONTRAST THE VANITY OF KNOWLEDGE WITH THE SOLID ADVANTAGES OF WEALTH
THE AMBITIOUS MAN WILL DESPISE KNOWLEDGE WHICH BRINGS NO HONOUR WHEREAS
THE PHILOSOPHER WILL REGARD ONLY THE FRUITION OF TRUTH AND WILL CALL
OTHER PLEASURES NECESSARY RATHER THAN GOOD
NOW HOW SHALL WE DECIDE
BETWEEN THEM IS THERE ANY BETTER CRITERION THAN EXPERIENCE AND
KNOWLEDGE AND WHICH OF THE THREE HAS THE TRUEST KNOWLEDGE AND THE
WIDEST EXPERIENCE THE EXPERIENCE OF YOUTH MAKES THE PHILOSOPHER
ACQUAINTED WITH THE TWO KINDS OF DESIRE BUT THE AVARICIOUS AND THE
AMBITIOUS MAN NEVER TASTE THE PLEASURES OF TRUTH AND WISDOM
HONOUR HE
HAS EQUALLY WITH THEM THEY ARE 'JUDGED OF HIM BUT HE IS 'NOT JUDGED
OF THEM FOR THEY NEVER ATTAIN TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE BEING
AND HIS
INSTRUMENT IS REASON WHEREAS THEIR STANDARD IS ONLY WEALTH AND HONOUR
AND IF BY REASON WE ARE TO JUDGE HIS GOOD WILL BE THE TRUEST
AND SO WE
ARRIVE AT THE RESULT THAT THE PLEASURE OF THE RATIONAL PART OF THE SOUL
AND A LIFE PASSED IN SUCH PLEASURE IS THE PLEASANTEST
HE WHO HAS A
RIGHT TO JUDGE JUDGES THUS
NEXT COMES THE LIFE OF AMBITION AND IN THE
THIRD PLACE THAT OF MONEY MAKING
TWICE HAS THE JUST MAN OVERTHROWN THE UNJUST ONCE MORE AS IN AN
OLYMPIAN CONTEST FIRST OFFERING UP A PRAYER TO THE SAVIOUR ZEUS LET
HIM TRY A FALL
A WISE MAN WHISPERS TO ME THAT THE PLEASURES OF THE WISE
ARE TRUE AND PURE ALL OTHERS ARE A SHADOW ONLY
LET US EXAMINE THIS
IS NOT PLEASURE OPPOSED TO PAIN AND IS THERE NOT A MEAN STATE WHICH
IS NEITHER WHEN A MAN IS SICK NOTHING IS MORE PLEASANT TO HIM THAN
HEALTH
BUT THIS HE NEVER FOUND OUT WHILE HE WAS WELL
IN PAIN HE
DESIRES ONLY TO CEASE FROM PAIN ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN HE IS IN AN
ECSTASY OF PLEASURE REST IS PAINFUL TO HIM
THUS REST OR CESSATION
IS BOTH PLEASURE AND PAIN
BUT CAN THAT WHICH IS NEITHER BECOME BOTH
AGAIN PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE MOTIONS AND THE ABSENCE OF THEM IS REST
BUT IF SO HOW CAN THE ABSENCE OF EITHER OF THEM BE THE OTHER THUS
WE ARE LED TO INFER THAT THE CONTRADICTION IS AN APPEARANCE ONLY AND
WITCHERY OF THE SENSES
AND THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY PLEASURES FOR THERE
ARE OTHERS WHICH HAVE NO PRECEDING PAINS
PURE PLEASURE THEN IS NOT THE
ABSENCE OF PAIN NOR PURE PAIN THE ABSENCE OF PLEASURE ALTHOUGH MOST OF
THE PLEASURES WHICH REACH THE MIND THROUGH THE BODY ARE RELIEFS OF
PAIN AND HAVE NOT ONLY THEIR REACTIONS WHEN THEY DEPART BUT THEIR
ANTICIPATIONS BEFORE THEY COME
THEY CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED IN A SIMILE
THERE IS IN NATURE AN UPPER LOWER AND MIDDLE REGION AND HE WHO PASSES
FROM THE LOWER TO THE MIDDLE IMAGINES THAT HE IS GOING UP AND IS ALREADY
IN THE UPPER WORLD AND IF HE WERE TAKEN BACK AGAIN WOULD THINK
AND TRULY THINK THAT HE WAS DESCENDING
ALL THIS ARISES OUT OF HIS
IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE UPPER MIDDLE AND LOWER REGIONS
AND A LIKE
CONFUSION HAPPENS WITH PLEASURE AND PAIN AND WITH MANY OTHER THINGS
THE MAN WHO COMPARES GREY WITH BLACK CALLS GREY WHITE AND THE MAN WHO
COMPARES ABSENCE OF PAIN WITH PAIN CALLS THE ABSENCE OF PAIN PLEASURE
AGAIN HUNGER AND THIRST ARE INANITIONS OF THE BODY IGNORANCE AND FOLLY
OF THE SOUL AND FOOD IS THE SATISFACTION OF THE ONE KNOWLEDGE OF THE
OTHER
NOW WHICH IS THE PURER SATISFACTION THAT OF EATING AND DRINKING
OR THAT OF KNOWLEDGE CONSIDER THE MATTER THUS THE SATISFACTION OF
THAT WHICH HAS MORE EXISTENCE IS TRUER THAN OF THAT WHICH HAS LESS
THE
INVARIABLE AND IMMORTAL HAS A MORE REAL EXISTENCE THAN THE VARIABLE
AND MORTAL AND HAS A CORRESPONDING MEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH
THE
SOUL AGAIN HAS MORE EXISTENCE AND TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE THAN THE BODY
AND IS THEREFORE MORE REALLY SATISFIED AND HAS A MORE NATURAL PLEASURE
THOSE WHO FEAST ONLY ON EARTHLY FOOD ARE ALWAYS GOING AT RANDOM UP
TO THE MIDDLE AND DOWN AGAIN BUT THEY NEVER PASS INTO THE TRUE UPPER
WORLD OR HAVE A TASTE OF TRUE PLEASURE
THEY ARE LIKE FATTED BEASTS
FULL OF GLUTTONY AND SENSUALITY AND READY TO KILL ONE ANOTHER BY REASON
OF THEIR INSATIABLE LUST FOR THEY ARE NOT FILLED WITH TRUE BEING AND
THEIR VESSEL IS LEAKY GORGIAS
THEIR PLEASURES ARE MERE SHADOWS OF
PLEASURE MIXED WITH PAIN COLOURED AND INTENSIFIED BY CONTRAST
AND THEREFORE INTENSELY DESIRED AND MEN GO FIGHTING ABOUT THEM AS
STESICHORUS SAYS THAT THE GREEKS FOUGHT ABOUT THE SHADOW OF HELEN AT
TROY BECAUSE THEY KNOW NOT THE TRUTH
THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE PASSIONATE ELEMENT THE DESIRES OF
THE AMBITIOUS SOUL AS WELL AS OF THE COVETOUS HAVE AN INFERIOR
SATISFACTION
ONLY WHEN UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF REASON DO EITHER OF THE
OTHER PRINCIPLES DO THEIR OWN BUSINESS OR ATTAIN THE PLEASURE WHICH IS
NATURAL TO THEM
WHEN NOT ATTAINING THEY COMPEL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE
SOUL TO PURSUE A SHADOW OF PLEASURE WHICH IS NOT THEIRS
AND THE MORE
DISTANT THEY ARE FROM PHILOSOPHY AND REASON THE MORE DISTANT THEY WILL
BE FROM LAW AND ORDER AND THE MORE ILLUSIVE WILL BE THEIR PLEASURES
THE DESIRES OF LOVE AND TYRANNY ARE THE FARTHEST FROM LAW AND THOSE
OF THE KING ARE NEAREST TO IT
THERE IS ONE GENUINE PLEASURE AND TWO
SPURIOUS ONES THE TYRANT GOES BEYOND EVEN THE LATTER HE HAS RUN AWAY
ALTOGETHER FROM LAW AND REASON
NOR CAN THE MEASURE OF HIS INFERIORITY
BE TOLD EXCEPT IN A FIGURE
THE TYRANT IS THE THIRD REMOVED FROM THE
OLIGARCH AND HAS THEREFORE NOT A SHADOW OF HIS PLEASURE BUT THE
SHADOW OF A SHADOW ONLY
THE OLIGARCH AGAIN IS THRICE REMOVED FROM
THE KING AND THUS WE GET THE FORMULA 3 X 3 WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF A
SURFACE REPRESENTING THE SHADOW WHICH IS THE TYRANT'S PLEASURE AND
IF YOU LIKE TO CUBE THIS 'NUMBER OF THE BEAST YOU WILL FIND THAT THE
MEASURE OF THE DIFFERENCE AMOUNTS TO 729 THE KING IS 729 TIMES MORE
HAPPY THAN THE TYRANT
AND THIS EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER IS NEARLY EQUAL
TO THE NUMBER OF DAYS AND NIGHTS IN A YEAR 365 X 2 730 AND IS
THEREFORE CONCERNED WITH HUMAN LIFE
THIS IS THE INTERVAL BETWEEN A GOOD
AND BAD MAN IN HAPPINESS ONLY WHAT MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
IN COMELINESS OF LIFE AND VIRTUE
PERHAPS YOU MAY REMEMBER SOME ONE SAYING AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR
DISCUSSION THAT THE UNJUST MAN WAS PROFITED IF HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF
JUSTICE
NOW THAT WE KNOW THE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE LET US
MAKE AN IMAGE OF THE SOUL WHICH WILL PERSONIFY HIS WORDS
FIRST OF ALL
FASHION A MULTITUDINOUS BEAST HAVING A RING OF HEADS OF ALL MANNER OF
ANIMALS TAME AND WILD AND ABLE TO PRODUCE AND CHANGE THEM AT PLEASURE
SUPPOSE NOW ANOTHER FORM OF A LION AND ANOTHER OF A MAN THE SECOND
SMALLER THAN THE FIRST THE THIRD THAN THE SECOND JOIN THEM TOGETHER
AND COVER THEM WITH A HUMAN SKIN IN WHICH THEY ARE COMPLETELY
CONCEALED
WHEN THIS HAS BEEN DONE LET US TELL THE SUPPORTER OF
INJUSTICE THAT HE IS FEEDING UP THE BEASTS AND STARVING THE MAN
THE
MAINTAINER OF JUSTICE ON THE OTHER HAND IS TRYING TO STRENGTHEN THE
MAN HE IS NOURISHING THE GENTLE PRINCIPLE WITHIN HIM AND MAKING AN
ALLIANCE WITH THE LION HEART IN ORDER THAT HE MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP DOWN
THE MANY HEADED HYDRA AND BRING ALL INTO UNITY WITH EACH OTHER AND
WITH THEMSELVES
THUS IN EVERY POINT OF VIEW WHETHER IN RELATION TO
PLEASURE HONOUR OR ADVANTAGE THE JUST MAN IS RIGHT AND THE UNJUST
WRONG
BUT NOW LET US REASON WITH THE UNJUST WHO IS NOT INTENTIONALLY IN
ERROR
IS NOT THE NOBLE THAT WHICH SUBJECTS THE BEAST TO THE MAN OR
RATHER TO THE GOD IN MAN THE IGNOBLE THAT WHICH SUBJECTS THE MAN TO
THE BEAST AND IF SO WHO WOULD RECEIVE GOLD ON CONDITION THAT HE WAS TO
DEGRADE THE NOBLEST PART OF HIMSELF UNDER THE WORST WHO WOULD SELL HIS
SON OR DAUGHTER INTO THE HANDS OF BRUTAL AND EVIL MEN FOR ANY AMOUNT
OF MONEY AND WILL HE SELL HIS OWN FAIRER AND DIVINER PART WITHOUT ANY
COMPUNCTION TO THE MOST GODLESS AND FOUL WOULD HE NOT BE WORSE THAN
ERIPHYLE WHO SOLD HER HUSBAND'S LIFE FOR A NECKLACE AND INTEMPERANCE
IS THE LETTING LOOSE OF THE MULTIFORM MONSTER AND PRIDE AND SULLENNESS
ARE THE GROWTH AND INCREASE OF THE LION AND SERPENT ELEMENT WHILE
LUXURY AND EFFEMINACY ARE CAUSED BY A TOO GREAT RELAXATION OF SPIRIT
FLATTERY AND MEANNESS AGAIN ARISE WHEN THE SPIRITED ELEMENT IS SUBJECTED
TO AVARICE AND THE LION IS HABITUATED TO BECOME A MONKEY
THE REAL
DISGRACE OF HANDICRAFT ARTS IS THAT THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THEM HAVE
TO FLATTER INSTEAD OF MASTERING THEIR DESIRES THEREFORE WE SAY THAT
THEY SHOULD BE PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE BETTER PRINCIPLE IN
ANOTHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE NONE IN THEMSELVES NOT AS THRASYMACHUS
IMAGINED TO THE INJURY OF THE SUBJECTS BUT FOR THEIR GOOD
AND OUR
INTENTION IN EDUCATING THE YOUNG IS TO GIVE THEM SELF CONTROL THE
LAW DESIRES TO NURSE UP IN THEM A HIGHER PRINCIPLE AND WHEN THEY HAVE
ACQUIRED THIS THEY MAY GO THEIR WAYS
'WHAT THEN SHALL A MAN PROFIT IF HE GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD' AND BECOME
MORE AND MORE WICKED OR WHAT SHALL HE PROFIT BY ESCAPING DISCOVERY IF
THE CONCEALMENT OF EVIL PREVENTS THE CURE IF HE HAD BEEN PUNISHED
THE BRUTE WITHIN HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENCED AND THE GENTLER ELEMENT
LIBERATED AND HE WOULD HAVE UNITED TEMPERANCE JUSTICE AND WISDOM IN
HIS SOUL A UNION BETTER FAR THAN ANY COMBINATION OF BODILY GIFTS
THE
MAN OF UNDERSTANDING WILL HONOUR KNOWLEDGE ABOVE ALL IN THE NEXT
PLACE HE WILL KEEP UNDER HIS BODY NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH AND
STRENGTH BUT IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THE MOST PERFECT HARMONY OF BODY
AND SOUL
IN THE ACQUISITION OF RICHES TOO HE WILL AIM AT ORDER AND
HARMONY HE WILL NOT DESIRE TO HEAP UP WEALTH WITHOUT MEASURE BUT HE
WILL FEAR THAT THE INCREASE OF WEALTH WILL DISTURB THE CONSTITUTION OF
HIS OWN SOUL
FOR THE SAME REASON HE WILL ONLY ACCEPT SUCH HONOURS AS
WILL MAKE HIM A BETTER MAN ANY OTHERS HE WILL DECLINE
'IN THAT CASE
SAID HE 'HE WILL NEVER BE A POLITICIAN YES BUT HE WILL IN HIS OWN
CITY THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN HIS NATIVE COUNTRY UNLESS BY SOME DIVINE
ACCIDENT
'YOU MEAN THAT HE WILL BE A CITIZEN OF THE IDEAL CITY WHICH
HAS NO PLACE UPON EARTH BUT IN HEAVEN I REPLIED THERE IS A PATTERN
OF SUCH A CITY AND HE WHO WISHES MAY ORDER HIS LIFE AFTER THAT IMAGE
WHETHER SUCH A STATE IS OR EVER WILL BE MATTERS NOT HE WILL ACT
ACCORDING TO THAT PATTERN AND NO OTHER
THE MOST NOTICEABLE POINTS IN THE 9TH BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC ARE 1 THE
ACCOUNT OF PLEASURE 2 THE NUMBER OF THE INTERVAL WHICH DIVIDES THE
KING FROM THE TYRANT 3 THE PATTERN WHICH IS IN HEAVEN
1
PLATO'S ACCOUNT OF PLEASURE IS REMARKABLE FOR MODERATION AND IN
THIS RESPECT CONTRASTS WITH THE LATER PLATONISTS AND THE VIEWS WHICH ARE
ATTRIBUTED TO THEM BY ARISTOTLE
HE IS NOT LIKE THE CYNICS OPPOSED
TO ALL PLEASURE BUT RATHER DESIRES THAT THE SEVERAL PARTS OF THE
SOUL SHALL HAVE THEIR NATURAL SATISFACTION HE EVEN AGREES WITH THE
EPICUREANS IN DESCRIBING PLEASURE AS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE ABSENCE OF
PAIN
THIS IS PROVED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THERE ARE PLEASURES WHICH
HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS AS HE ALSO REMARKS IN THE PHILEBUS SUCH AS
THE PLEASURES OF SMELL AND ALSO THE PLEASURES OF HOPE AND ANTICIPATION
IN THE PREVIOUS BOOK HE HAD MADE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN NECESSARY
AND UNNECESSARY PLEASURE WHICH IS REPEATED BY ARISTOTLE AND HE NOW
OBSERVES THAT THERE ARE A FURTHER CLASS OF 'WILD BEAST' PLEASURES
CORRESPONDING TO ARISTOTLE'S GREEK
HE DWELLS UPON THE RELATIVE AND
UNREAL CHARACTER OF SENSUAL PLEASURES AND THE ILLUSION WHICH ARISES OUT
OF THE CONTRAST OF PLEASURE AND PAIN POINTING OUT THE SUPERIORITY OF
THE PLEASURES OF REASON WHICH ARE AT REST OVER THE FLEETING PLEASURES
OF SENSE AND EMOTION
THE PRE EMINENCE OF ROYAL PLEASURE IS SHOWN BY
THE FACT THAT REASON IS ABLE TO FORM A JUDGMENT OF THE LOWER PLEASURES
WHILE THE TWO LOWER PARTS OF THE SOUL ARE INCAPABLE OF JUDGING THE
PLEASURES OF REASON
THUS IN HIS TREATMENT OF PLEASURE AS IN MANY
OTHER SUBJECTS THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO IS 'SAWN UP INTO QUANTITIES' BY
ARISTOTLE THE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY MADE BY HIM BECAME IN THE
NEXT GENERATION THE FOUNDATION OF FURTHER TECHNICAL DISTINCTIONS
BOTH
IN PLATO AND ARISTOTLE WE NOTE THE ILLUSION UNDER WHICH THE ANCIENTS
FELL OF REGARDING THE TRANSIENCE OF PLEASURE AS A PROOF OF ITS
UNREALITY AND OF CONFOUNDING THE PERMANENCE OF THE INTELLECTUAL
PLEASURES WITH THE UNCHANGEABLENESS OF THE KNOWLEDGE FROM WHICH THEY ARE
DERIVED
NEITHER DO WE LIKE TO ADMIT THAT THE PLEASURES OF KNOWLEDGE
THOUGH MORE ELEVATING ARE NOT MORE LASTING THAN OTHER PLEASURES
AND ARE ALMOST EQUALLY DEPENDENT ON THE ACCIDENTS OF OUR BODILY STATE
INTRODUCTION TO PHILEBUS
2
THE NUMBER OF THE INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATES THE KING FROM THE TYRANT
AND ROYAL FROM TYRANNICAL PLEASURES IS 729 THE CUBE OF 9
WHICH PLATO
CHARACTERISTICALLY DESIGNATES AS A NUMBER CONCERNED WITH HUMAN LIFE
BECAUSE NEARLY EQUIVALENT TO THE NUMBER OF DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE
YEAR
HE IS DESIROUS OF PROCLAIMING THAT THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THEM IS
IMMEASURABLE AND INVENTS A FORMULA TO GIVE EXPRESSION TO HIS IDEA
THOSE WHO SPOKE OF JUSTICE AS A CUBE OF VIRTUE AS AN ART OF MEASURING
PROT SAW NO INAPPROPRIATENESS IN CONCEIVING THE SOUL UNDER THE
FIGURE OF A LINE OR THE PLEASURE OF THE TYRANT AS SEPARATED FROM THE
PLEASURE OF THE KING BY THE NUMERICAL INTERVAL OF 729
AND IN MODERN
TIMES WE SOMETIMES USE METAPHORICALLY WHAT PLATO EMPLOYED AS A
PHILOSOPHICAL FORMULA
'IT IS NOT EASY TO ESTIMATE THE LOSS OF THE
TYRANT EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THIS WAY SAYS PLATO
SO WE MIGHT SAY THAT
ALTHOUGH THE LIFE OF A GOOD MAN IS NOT TO BE COMPARED TO THAT OF A BAD
MAN YET YOU MAY MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM BY VALUING ONE
MINUTE OF THE ONE AT AN HOUR OF THE OTHER 'ONE DAY IN THY COURTS IS
BETTER THAN A THOUSAND' OR YOU MIGHT SAY THAT 'THERE IS AN INFINITE
DIFFERENCE BUT THIS IS NOT SO MUCH AS SAYING IN HOMELY PHRASE 'THEY
ARE A THOUSAND MILES ASUNDER AND ACCORDINGLY PLATO FINDS THE NATURAL
VEHICLE OF HIS THOUGHTS IN A PROGRESSION OF NUMBERS THIS ARITHMETICAL
FORMULA HE DRAWS OUT WITH THE UTMOST SERIOUSNESS AND BOTH HERE AND IN
THE NUMBER OF GENERATION SEEMS TO FIND AN ADDITIONAL PROOF OF THE TRUTH
OF HIS SPECULATION IN FORMING THE NUMBER INTO A GEOMETRICAL FIGURE JUST
AS PERSONS IN OUR OWN DAY ARE APT TO FANCY THAT A STATEMENT IS VERIFIED
WHEN IT HAS BEEN ONLY THROWN INTO AN ABSTRACT FORM
IN SPEAKING OF THE
NUMBER 729 AS PROPER TO HUMAN LIFE HE PROBABLY INTENDED TO INTIMATE
THAT ONE YEAR OF THE TYRANNICAL 12 HOURS OF THE ROYAL LIFE
THE SIMPLE OBSERVATION THAT THE COMPARISON OF TWO SIMILAR SOLIDS
IS EFFECTED BY THE COMPARISON OF THE CUBES OF THEIR SIDES IS THE
MATHEMATICAL GROUNDWORK OF THIS FANCIFUL EXPRESSION
THERE IS SOME
DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING THE STEPS BY WHICH THE NUMBER 729 IS OBTAINED
THE OLIGARCH IS REMOVED IN THE THIRD DEGREE FROM THE ROYAL AND
ARISTOCRATICAL AND THE TYRANT IN THE THIRD DEGREE FROM THE
OLIGARCHICAL BUT WE HAVE TO ARRANGE THE TERMS AS THE SIDES OF A SQUARE
AND TO COUNT THE OLIGARCH TWICE OVER THUS RECKONING THEM NOT AS 5 BUT
AS 9
THE SQUARE OF 9 IS PASSED LIGHTLY OVER AS ONLY A STEP TOWARDS
THE CUBE
3
TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE REPUBLIC PLATO SEEMS TO BE MORE AND MORE
CONVINCED OF THE IDEAL CHARACTER OF HIS OWN SPECULATIONS
AT THE END OF
THE 9TH BOOK THE PATTERN WHICH IS IN HEAVEN TAKES THE PLACE OF THE
CITY OF PHILOSOPHERS ON EARTH
THE VISION WHICH HAS RECEIVED FORM AND
SUBSTANCE AT HIS HANDS IS NOW DISCOVERED TO BE AT A DISTANCE
AND YET
THIS DISTANT KINGDOM IS ALSO THE RULE OF MAN'S LIFE
'SAY NOT LO HERE
OR LO THERE FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU THUS A NOTE
IS STRUCK WHICH PREPARES FOR THE REVELATION OF A FUTURE LIFE IN THE
FOLLOWING BOOK
BUT THE FUTURE LIFE IS PRESENT STILL THE IDEAL OF
POLITICS IS TO BE REALIZED IN THE INDIVIDUAL
BOOK X
MANY THINGS PLEASED ME IN THE ORDER OF OUR STATE BUT THERE
WAS NOTHING WHICH I LIKED BETTER THAN THE REGULATION ABOUT POETRY
THE
DIVISION OF THE SOUL THROWS A NEW LIGHT ON OUR EXCLUSION OF IMITATION
I DO NOT MIND TELLING YOU IN CONFIDENCE THAT ALL POETRY IS AN OUTRAGE ON
THE UNDERSTANDING UNLESS THE HEARERS HAVE THAT BALM OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH
HEALS ERROR
I HAVE LOVED HOMER EVER SINCE I WAS A BOY AND EVEN NOW
HE APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE GREAT MASTER OF TRAGIC POETRY
BUT MUCH AS
I LOVE THE MAN I LOVE TRUTH MORE AND THEREFORE I MUST SPEAK OUT AND
FIRST OF ALL WILL YOU EXPLAIN WHAT IS IMITATION FOR REALLY I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND 'HOW LIKELY THEN THAT I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT MIGHT VERY
WELL BE FOR THE DULLER OFTEN SEES BETTER THAN THE KEENER EYE
'TRUE
BUT IN YOUR PRESENCE I CAN HARDLY VENTURE TO SAY WHAT I THINK
THEN SUPPOSE THAT WE BEGIN IN OUR OLD FASHION WITH THE DOCTRINE OF
UNIVERSALS
LET US ASSUME THE EXISTENCE OF BEDS AND TABLES
THERE IS ONE
IDEA OF A BED OR OF A TABLE WHICH THE MAKER OF EACH HAD IN HIS MIND
WHEN MAKING THEM HE DID NOT MAKE THE IDEAS OF BEDS AND TABLES BUT HE
MADE BEDS AND TABLES ACCORDING TO THE IDEAS
AND IS THERE NOT A MAKER
OF THE WORKS OF ALL WORKMEN WHO MAKES NOT ONLY VESSELS BUT PLANTS AND
ANIMALS HIMSELF THE EARTH AND HEAVEN AND THINGS IN HEAVEN AND UNDER
THE EARTH HE MAKES THE GODS ALSO
'HE MUST BE A WIZARD INDEED BUT DO
YOU NOT SEE THAT THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH YOU COULD DO THE SAME YOU
HAVE ONLY TO TAKE A MIRROR AND CATCH THE REFLECTION OF THE SUN AND THE
EARTH OR ANYTHING ELSE THERE NOW YOU HAVE MADE THEM
'YES BUT ONLY
IN APPEARANCE EXACTLY SO AND THE PAINTER IS SUCH A CREATOR AS YOU ARE
WITH THE MIRROR AND HE IS EVEN MORE UNREAL THAN THE CARPENTER ALTHOUGH
NEITHER THE CARPENTER NOR ANY OTHER ARTIST CAN BE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE
ABSOLUTE BED
'NOT IF PHILOSOPHERS MAY BE BELIEVED NOR NEED WE WONDER
THAT HIS BED HAS BUT AN IMPERFECT RELATION TO THE TRUTH
REFLECT HERE
ARE THREE BEDS ONE IN NATURE WHICH IS MADE BY GOD ANOTHER WHICH IS
MADE BY THE CARPENTER AND THE THIRD BY THE PAINTER
GOD ONLY MADE ONE
NOR COULD HE HAVE MADE MORE THAN ONE FOR IF THERE HAD BEEN TWO THERE
WOULD ALWAYS HAVE BEEN A THIRD MORE ABSOLUTE AND ABSTRACT THAN EITHER
UNDER WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED
WE MAY THEREFORE CONCEIVE GOD
TO BE THE NATURAL MAKER OF THE BED AND IN A LOWER SENSE THE CARPENTER
IS ALSO THE MAKER BUT THE PAINTER IS RATHER THE IMITATOR OF WHAT THE
OTHER TWO MAKE HE HAS TO DO WITH A CREATION WHICH IS THRICE REMOVED
FROM REALITY
AND THE TRAGIC POET IS AN IMITATOR AND LIKE EVERY
OTHER IMITATOR IS THRICE REMOVED FROM THE KING AND FROM THE TRUTH
THE PAINTER IMITATES NOT THE ORIGINAL BED BUT THE BED MADE BY THE
CARPENTER
AND THIS WITHOUT BEING REALLY DIFFERENT APPEARS TO BE
DIFFERENT AND HAS MANY POINTS OF VIEW OF WHICH ONLY ONE IS CAUGHT BY
THE PAINTER WHO REPRESENTS EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS A PIECE OF
EVERYTHING AND THAT PIECE AN IMAGE
AND HE CAN PAINT ANY OTHER ARTIST
ALTHOUGH HE KNOWS NOTHING OF THEIR ARTS AND THIS WITH SUFFICIENT SKILL
TO DECEIVE CHILDREN OR SIMPLE PEOPLE
SUPPOSE NOW THAT SOMEBODY CAME TO
US AND TOLD US HOW HE HAD MET A MAN WHO KNEW ALL THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS
AND BETTER THAN ANYBODY SHOULD WE NOT INFER HIM TO BE A SIMPLETON WHO
HAVING NO DISCERNMENT OF TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD HAD MET WITH A WIZARD
OR ENCHANTER WHOM HE FANCIED TO BE ALL WISE AND WHEN WE HEAR PERSONS
SAYING THAT HOMER AND THE TRAGEDIANS KNOW ALL THE ARTS AND ALL THE
VIRTUES MUST WE NOT INFER THAT THEY ARE UNDER A SIMILAR DELUSION THEY
DO NOT SEE THAT THE POETS ARE IMITATORS AND THAT THEIR CREATIONS ARE
ONLY IMITATIONS
'VERY TRUE BUT IF A PERSON COULD CREATE AS WELL AS
IMITATE HE WOULD RATHER LEAVE SOME PERMANENT WORK AND NOT AN IMITATION
ONLY HE WOULD RATHER BE THE RECEIVER THAN THE GIVER OF PRAISE 'YES
FOR THEN HE WOULD HAVE MORE HONOUR AND ADVANTAGE
LET US NOW INTERROGATE HOMER AND THE POETS
FRIEND HOMER SAY I TO HIM
I AM NOT GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT MEDICINE OR ANY ART TO WHICH YOUR
POEMS INCIDENTALLY REFER BUT ABOUT THEIR MAIN SUBJECTS WAR MILITARY
TACTICS POLITICS
IF YOU ARE ONLY TWICE AND NOT THRICE REMOVED FROM THE
TRUTH NOT AN IMITATOR OR AN IMAGE MAKER PLEASE TO INFORM US WHAT GOOD
YOU HAVE EVER DONE TO MANKIND IS THERE ANY CITY WHICH PROFESSES TO HAVE
RECEIVED LAWS FROM YOU AS SICILY AND ITALY HAVE FROM CHARONDAS SPARTA
FROM LYCURGUS ATHENS FROM SOLON OR WAS ANY WAR EVER CARRIED ON BY YOUR
COUNSELS OR IS ANY INVENTION ATTRIBUTED TO YOU AS THERE IS TO THALES
AND ANACHARSIS OR IS THERE ANY HOMERIC WAY OF LIFE SUCH AS THE
PYTHAGOREAN WAS IN WHICH YOU INSTRUCTED MEN AND WHICH IS CALLED AFTER
YOU 'NO INDEED AND CREOPHYLUS FLESH CHILD WAS EVEN MORE UNFORTUNATE
IN HIS BREEDING THAN HE WAS IN HIS NAME IF AS TRADITION SAYS HOMER IN
HIS LIFETIME WAS ALLOWED BY HIM AND HIS OTHER FRIENDS TO STARVE YES
BUT COULD THIS EVER HAVE HAPPENED IF HOMER HAD REALLY BEEN THE EDUCATOR
OF HELLAS WOULD HE NOT HAVE HAD MANY DEVOTED FOLLOWERS IF PROTAGORAS
AND PRODICUS CAN PERSUADE THEIR CONTEMPORARIES THAT NO ONE CAN MANAGE
HOUSE OR STATE WITHOUT THEM IS IT LIKELY THAT HOMER AND HESIOD WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO GO ABOUT AS BEGGARS I MEAN IF THEY HAD REALLY BEEN
ABLE TO DO THE WORLD ANY GOOD WOULD NOT MEN HAVE COMPELLED THEM
TO STAY WHERE THEY WERE OR HAVE FOLLOWED THEM ABOUT IN ORDER TO GET
EDUCATION BUT THEY DID NOT AND THEREFORE WE MAY INFER THAT HOMER AND
ALL THE POETS ARE ONLY IMITATORS WHO DO BUT IMITATE THE APPEARANCES OF
THINGS
FOR AS A PAINTER BY A KNOWLEDGE OF FIGURE AND COLOUR CAN PAINT A
COBBLER WITHOUT ANY PRACTICE IN COBBLING SO THE POET CAN DELINEATE
ANY ART IN THE COLOURS OF LANGUAGE AND GIVE HARMONY AND RHYTHM TO THE
COBBLER AND ALSO TO THE GENERAL AND YOU KNOW HOW MERE NARRATION WHEN
DEPRIVED OF THE ORNAMENTS OF METRE IS LIKE A FACE WHICH HAS LOST THE
BEAUTY OF YOUTH AND NEVER HAD ANY OTHER
ONCE MORE THE IMITATOR HAS NO
KNOWLEDGE OF REALITY BUT ONLY OF APPEARANCE
THE PAINTER PAINTS AND
THE ARTIFICER MAKES A BRIDLE AND REINS BUT NEITHER UNDERSTANDS THE USE
OF THEM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS IS CONFINED TO THE HORSEMAN AND SO OF
OTHER THINGS
THUS WE HAVE THREE ARTS ONE OF USE ANOTHER OF INVENTION
A THIRD OF IMITATION AND THE USER FURNISHES THE RULE TO THE TWO OTHERS
THE FLUTE PLAYER WILL KNOW THE GOOD AND BAD FLUTE AND THE MAKER
WILL PUT FAITH IN HIM BUT THE IMITATOR WILL NEITHER KNOW NOR HAVE
FAITH NEITHER SCIENCE NOR TRUE OPINION CAN BE ASCRIBED TO HIM
IMITATION THEN IS DEVOID OF KNOWLEDGE BEING ONLY A KIND OF PLAY
OR SPORT AND THE TRAGIC AND EPIC POETS ARE IMITATORS IN THE HIGHEST
DEGREE
AND NOW LET US ENQUIRE WHAT IS THE FACULTY IN MAN WHICH ANSWERS TO
IMITATION
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN MY MEANING OBJECTS ARE DIFFERENTLY SEEN
WHEN IN THE WATER AND WHEN OUT OF THE WATER WHEN NEAR AND WHEN AT A
DISTANCE AND THE PAINTER OR JUGGLER MAKES USE OF THIS VARIATION TO
IMPOSE UPON US
AND THE ART OF MEASURING AND WEIGHING AND CALCULATING
COMES IN TO SAVE OUR BEWILDERED MINDS FROM THE POWER OF APPEARANCE FOR
AS WE WERE SAYING TWO CONTRARY OPINIONS OF THE SAME ABOUT THE SAME AND
AT THE SAME TIME CANNOT BOTH OF THEM BE TRUE
BUT WHICH OF THEM IS
TRUE IS DETERMINED BY THE ART OF CALCULATION AND THIS IS ALLIED TO THE
BETTER FACULTY IN THE SOUL AS THE ARTS OF IMITATION ARE TO THE WORSE
AND THE SAME HOLDS OF THE EAR AS WELL AS OF THE EYE OF POETRY AS WELL
AS PAINTING
THE IMITATION IS OF ACTIONS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY
IN WHICH THERE IS AN EXPECTATION OF A GOOD OR BAD RESULT AND PRESENT
EXPERIENCE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN
BUT IS A MAN IN HARMONY WITH HIMSELF
WHEN HE IS THE SUBJECT OF THESE CONFLICTING INFLUENCES IS THERE NOT
RATHER A CONTRADICTION IN HIM LET ME FURTHER ASK WHETHER HE IS MORE
LIKELY TO CONTROL SORROW WHEN HE IS ALONE OR WHEN HE IS IN COMPANY
'IN THE LATTER CASE FEELING WOULD LEAD HIM TO INDULGE HIS SORROW BUT
REASON AND LAW CONTROL HIM AND ENJOIN PATIENCE SINCE HE CANNOT KNOW
WHETHER HIS AFFLICTION IS GOOD OR EVIL AND NO HUMAN THING IS OF
ANY GREAT CONSEQUENCE WHILE SORROW IS CERTAINLY A HINDRANCE TO GOOD
COUNSEL
FOR WHEN WE STUMBLE WE SHOULD NOT LIKE CHILDREN MAKE AN
UPROAR WE SHOULD TAKE THE MEASURES WHICH REASON PRESCRIBES NOT RAISING
A LAMENT BUT FINDING A CURE
AND THE BETTER PART OF US IS READY TO
FOLLOW REASON WHILE THE IRRATIONAL PRINCIPLE IS FULL OF SORROW AND
DISTRACTION AT THE RECOLLECTION OF OUR TROUBLES
UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER
THIS LATTER FURNISHES THE CHIEF MATERIALS OF THE IMITATIVE ARTS
WHEREAS
REASON IS EVER IN REPOSE AND CANNOT EASILY BE DISPLAYED ESPECIALLY TO A
MIXED MULTITUDE WHO HAVE NO EXPERIENCE OF HER
THUS THE POET IS LIKE THE
PAINTER IN TWO WAYS FIRST HE PAINTS AN INFERIOR DEGREE OF TRUTH AND
SECONDLY HE IS CONCERNED WITH AN INFERIOR PART OF THE SOUL
HE INDULGES
THE FEELINGS WHILE HE ENFEEBLES THE REASON AND WE REFUSE TO ALLOW HIM
TO HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND OF MAN FOR HE HAS NO MEASURE OF GREATER
AND LESS AND IS A MAKER OF IMAGES AND VERY FAR GONE FROM TRUTH
BUT WE HAVE NOT YET MENTIONED THE HEAVIEST COUNT IN THE INDICTMENT THE
POWER WHICH POETRY HAS OF INJURIOUSLY EXCITING THE FEELINGS
WHEN WE
HEAR SOME PASSAGE IN WHICH A HERO LAMENTS HIS SUFFERINGS AT TEDIOUS
LENGTH YOU KNOW THAT WE SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM AND PRAISE THE POET AND
YET IN OUR OWN SORROWS SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF FEELING IS REGARDED AS
EFFEMINATE AND UNMANLY ION
NOW OUGHT A MAN TO FEEL PLEASURE IN
SEEING ANOTHER DO WHAT HE HATES AND ABOMINATES IN HIMSELF IS HE NOT
GIVING WAY TO A SENTIMENT WHICH IN HIS OWN CASE HE WOULD CONTROL HE IS
OFF HIS GUARD BECAUSE THE SORROW IS ANOTHER'S AND HE THINKS THAT HE
MAY INDULGE HIS FEELINGS WITHOUT DISGRACE AND WILL BE THE GAINER BY
THE PLEASURE
BUT THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT HE WHO BEGINS BY
WEEPING AT THE SORROWS OF OTHERS WILL END BY WEEPING AT HIS OWN
THE
SAME IS TRUE OF COMEDY YOU MAY OFTEN LAUGH AT BUFFOONERY WHICH YOU
WOULD BE ASHAMED TO UTTER AND THE LOVE OF COARSE MERRIMENT ON THE STAGE
WILL AT LAST TURN YOU INTO A BUFFOON AT HOME
POETRY FEEDS AND WATERS
THE PASSIONS AND DESIRES SHE LETS THEM RULE INSTEAD OF RULING THEM
AND
THEREFORE WHEN WE HEAR THE ENCOMIASTS OF HOMER AFFIRMING THAT HE IS
THE EDUCATOR OF HELLAS AND THAT ALL LIFE SHOULD BE REGULATED BY HIS
PRECEPTS WE MAY ALLOW THE EXCELLENCE OF THEIR INTENTIONS AND AGREE
WITH THEM IN THINKING HOMER A GREAT POET AND TRAGEDIAN
BUT WE SHALL
CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT ALL POETRY WHICH GOES BEYOND HYMNS TO THE GODS AND
PRAISES OF FAMOUS MEN
NOT PLEASURE AND PAIN BUT LAW AND REASON SHALL
RULE IN OUR STATE
THESE ARE OUR GROUNDS FOR EXPELLING POETRY BUT LEST SHE SHOULD CHARGE
US WITH DISCOURTESY LET US ALSO MAKE AN APOLOGY TO HER
WE WILL REMIND
HER THAT THERE IS AN ANCIENT QUARREL BETWEEN POETRY AND PHILOSOPHY OF
WHICH THERE ARE MANY TRACES IN THE WRITINGS OF THE POETS SUCH AS THE
SAYING OF 'THE SHE DOG YELPING AT HER MISTRESS AND 'THE PHILOSOPHERS
WHO ARE READY TO CIRCUMVENT ZEUS AND 'THE PHILOSOPHERS WHO ARE
PAUPERS NEVERTHELESS WE BEAR HER NO ILL WILL AND WILL GLADLY ALLOW
HER TO RETURN UPON CONDITION THAT SHE MAKES A DEFENCE OF HERSELF IN
VERSE AND HER SUPPORTERS WHO ARE NOT POETS MAY SPEAK IN PROSE
WE
CONFESS HER CHARMS BUT IF SHE CANNOT SHOW THAT SHE IS USEFUL AS WELL
AS DELIGHTFUL LIKE RATIONAL LOVERS WE MUST RENOUNCE OUR LOVE
THOUGH ENDEARED TO US BY EARLY ASSOCIATIONS
HAVING COME TO YEARS OF
DISCRETION WE KNOW THAT POETRY IS NOT TRUTH AND THAT A MAN SHOULD BE
CAREFUL HOW HE INTRODUCES HER TO THAT STATE OR CONSTITUTION WHICH HE
HIMSELF IS FOR THERE IS A MIGHTY ISSUE AT STAKE NO LESS THAN THE GOOD
OR EVIL OF A HUMAN SOUL
AND IT IS NOT WORTH WHILE TO FORSAKE JUSTICE
AND VIRTUE FOR THE ATTRACTIONS OF POETRY ANY MORE THAN FOR THE SAKE OF
HONOUR OR WEALTH
'I AGREE WITH YOU
AND YET THE REWARDS OF VIRTUE ARE GREATER FAR THAN I HAVE DESCRIBED
'AND CAN WE CONCEIVE THINGS GREATER STILL NOT PERHAPS IN THIS BRIEF
SPAN OF LIFE BUT SHOULD AN IMMORTAL BEING CARE ABOUT ANYTHING SHORT OF
ETERNITY 'I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT THE
SOUL IS IMMORTAL 'SURELY YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO PROVE THAT INDEED I
AM
'THEN LET ME HEAR THIS ARGUMENT OF WHICH YOU MAKE SO LIGHT
YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT EVERYTHING HAS AN ELEMENT OF GOOD AND OF EVIL
IN
ALL THINGS THERE IS AN INHERENT CORRUPTION AND IF THIS CANNOT DESTROY
THEM NOTHING ELSE WILL
THE SOUL TOO HAS HER OWN CORRUPTING PRINCIPLES
WHICH ARE INJUSTICE INTEMPERANCE COWARDICE AND THE LIKE
BUT NONE OF
THESE DESTROY THE SOUL IN THE SAME SENSE THAT DISEASE DESTROYS THE BODY
THE SOUL MAY BE FULL OF ALL INIQUITIES BUT IS NOT BY REASON OF THEM
BROUGHT ANY NEARER TO DEATH
NOTHING WHICH WAS NOT DESTROYED FROM WITHIN
EVER PERISHED BY EXTERNAL AFFECTION OF EVIL
THE BODY WHICH IS ONE
THING CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY FOOD WHICH IS ANOTHER UNLESS THE BADNESS
OF THE FOOD IS COMMUNICATED TO THE BODY
NEITHER CAN THE SOUL WHICH
IS ONE THING BE CORRUPTED BY THE BODY WHICH IS ANOTHER UNLESS SHE
HERSELF IS INFECTED
AND AS NO BODILY EVIL CAN INFECT THE SOUL NEITHER
CAN ANY BODILY EVIL WHETHER DISEASE OR VIOLENCE OR ANY OTHER DESTROY
THE SOUL UNLESS IT CAN BE SHOWN TO RENDER HER UNHOLY AND UNJUST
BUT NO
ONE WILL EVER PROVE THAT THE SOULS OF MEN BECOME MORE UNJUST WHEN
THEY DIE
IF A PERSON HAS THE AUDACITY TO SAY THE CONTRARY THE ANSWER
IS THEN WHY DO CRIMINALS REQUIRE THE HAND OF THE EXECUTIONER AND
NOT DIE OF THEMSELVES 'TRULY HE SAID 'INJUSTICE WOULD NOT BE VERY
TERRIBLE IF IT BROUGHT A CESSATION OF EVIL BUT I RATHER BELIEVE THAT
THE INJUSTICE WHICH MURDERS OTHERS MAY TEND TO QUICKEN AND STIMULATE
THE LIFE OF THE UNJUST YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
IF SIN WHICH IS HER OWN
NATURAL AND INHERENT EVIL CANNOT DESTROY THE SOUL HARDLY WILL ANYTHING
ELSE DESTROY HER
BUT THE SOUL WHICH CANNOT BE DESTROYED EITHER BY
INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL EVIL MUST BE IMMORTAL AND EVERLASTING
AND IF
THIS BE TRUE SOULS WILL ALWAYS EXIST IN THE SAME NUMBER
THEY CANNOT
DIMINISH BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE DESTROYED NOR YET INCREASE FOR THE
INCREASE OF THE IMMORTAL MUST COME FROM SOMETHING MORTAL AND SO ALL
WOULD END IN IMMORTALITY
NEITHER IS THE SOUL VARIABLE AND DIVERSE FOR
THAT WHICH IS IMMORTAL MUST BE OF THE FAIREST AND SIMPLEST COMPOSITION
IF WE WOULD CONCEIVE HER TRULY AND SO BEHOLD JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE IN
THEIR OWN NATURE SHE MUST BE VIEWED BY THE LIGHT OF REASON PURE AS AT
BIRTH OR AS SHE IS REFLECTED IN PHILOSOPHY WHEN HOLDING CONVERSE WITH
THE DIVINE AND IMMORTAL AND ETERNAL
IN HER PRESENT CONDITION WE SEE HER
ONLY LIKE THE SEA GOD GLAUCUS BRUISED AND MAIMED IN THE SEA WHICH IS
THE WORLD AND COVERED WITH SHELLS AND STONES WHICH ARE INCRUSTED UPON
HER FROM THE ENTERTAINMENTS OF EARTH
THUS FAR AS THE ARGUMENT REQUIRED WE HAVE SAID NOTHING OF THE REWARDS
AND HONOURS WHICH THE POETS ATTRIBUTE TO JUSTICE WE HAVE CONTENTED
OURSELVES WITH SHOWING THAT JUSTICE IN HERSELF IS BEST FOR THE SOUL IN
HERSELF EVEN IF A MAN SHOULD PUT ON A GYGES' RING AND HAVE THE HELMET
OF HADES TOO
AND NOW YOU SHALL REPAY ME WHAT YOU BORROWED AND I WILL
ENUMERATE THE REWARDS OF JUSTICE IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH
I GRANTED
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT AS YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT EVIL MIGHT
PERHAPS ESCAPE THE KNOWLEDGE OF GODS AND MEN ALTHOUGH THIS WAS REALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
AND SINCE I HAVE SHOWN THAT JUSTICE HAS REALITY YOU MUST
GRANT ME ALSO THAT SHE HAS THE PALM OF APPEARANCE
IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE JUST MAN IS KNOWN TO THE GODS AND HE IS THEREFORE THE FRIEND OF THE
GODS AND HE WILL RECEIVE AT THEIR HANDS EVERY GOOD ALWAYS EXCEPTING
SUCH EVIL AS IS THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF FORMER SINS
ALL THINGS END
IN GOOD TO HIM EITHER IN LIFE OR AFTER DEATH EVEN WHAT APPEARS TO
BE EVIL FOR THE GODS HAVE A CARE OF HIM WHO DESIRES TO BE IN THEIR
LIKENESS
AND WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF MEN IS NOT HONESTY THE BEST POLICY
THE CLEVER ROGUE MAKES A GREAT START AT FIRST BUT BREAKS DOWN BEFORE HE
REACHES THE GOAL AND SLINKS AWAY IN DISHONOUR WHEREAS THE TRUE RUNNER
PERSEVERES TO THE END AND RECEIVES THE PRIZE
AND YOU MUST ALLOW ME
TO REPEAT ALL THE BLESSINGS WHICH YOU ATTRIBUTED TO THE FORTUNATE
UNJUST THEY BEAR RULE IN THE CITY THEY MARRY AND GIVE IN MARRIAGE TO
WHOM THEY WILL AND THE EVILS WHICH YOU ATTRIBUTED TO THE UNFORTUNATE
JUST DO REALLY FALL IN THE END ON THE UNJUST ALTHOUGH AS YOU IMPLIED
THEIR SUFFERINGS ARE BETTER VEILED IN SILENCE
BUT ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THIS PRESENT LIFE ARE AS NOTHING WHEN COMPARED
WITH THOSE WHICH AWAIT GOOD MEN AFTER DEATH
'I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR
ABOUT THEM COME THEN AND I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF ER THE SON OF
ARMENIUS A VALIANT MAN
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE DIED IN BATTLE BUT TEN
DAYS AFTERWARDS HIS BODY WAS FOUND UNTOUCHED BY CORRUPTION AND SENT HOME
FOR BURIAL
ON THE TWELFTH DAY HE WAS PLACED ON THE FUNERAL PYRE AND
THERE HE CAME TO LIFE AGAIN AND TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN THE WORLD
BELOW
HE SAID THAT HIS SOUL WENT WITH A GREAT COMPANY TO A PLACE IN
WHICH THERE WERE TWO CHASMS NEAR TOGETHER IN THE EARTH BENEATH AND TWO
CORRESPONDING CHASMS IN THE HEAVEN ABOVE
AND THERE WERE JUDGES SITTING
IN THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE BIDDING THE JUST ASCEND BY THE HEAVENLY
WAY ON THE RIGHT HAND HAVING THE SEAL OF THEIR JUDGMENT SET UPON THEM
BEFORE WHILE THE UNJUST HAVING THE SEAL BEHIND WERE BIDDEN TO DESCEND
BY THE WAY ON THE LEFT HAND
HIM THEY TOLD TO LOOK AND LISTEN AS HE WAS
TO BE THEIR MESSENGER TO MEN FROM THE WORLD BELOW
AND HE BEHELD AND SAW
THE SOULS DEPARTING AFTER JUDGMENT AT EITHER CHASM SOME WHO CAME FROM
EARTH WERE WORN AND TRAVEL STAINED OTHERS WHO CAME FROM HEAVEN
WERE CLEAN AND BRIGHT
THEY SEEMED GLAD TO MEET AND REST AWHILE IN THE
MEADOW HERE THEY DISCOURSED WITH ONE ANOTHER OF WHAT THEY HAD SEEN IN
THE OTHER WORLD
THOSE WHO CAME FROM EARTH WEPT AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF
THEIR SORROWS BUT THE SPIRITS FROM ABOVE SPOKE OF GLORIOUS SIGHTS AND
HEAVENLY BLISS
HE SAID THAT FOR EVERY EVIL DEED THEY WERE PUNISHED
TENFOLD NOW THE JOURNEY WAS OF A THOUSAND YEARS' DURATION BECAUSE THE
LIFE OF MAN WAS RECKONED AS A HUNDRED YEARS AND THE REWARDS OF VIRTUE
WERE IN THE SAME PROPORTION
HE ADDED SOMETHING HARDLY WORTH REPEATING
ABOUT INFANTS DYING ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY WERE BORN
OF PARRICIDES AND
OTHER MURDERERS HE HAD TORTURES STILL MORE TERRIBLE TO NARRATE
HE WAS
PRESENT WHEN ONE OF THE SPIRITS ASKED WHERE IS ARDIAEUS THE GREAT
THIS ARDIAEUS WAS A CRUEL TYRANT WHO HAD MURDERED HIS FATHER AND HIS
ELDER BROTHER A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE ANOTHER SPIRIT ANSWERED
'HE COMES NOT HITHER AND WILL NEVER COME
AND I MYSELF HE ADDED
'ACTUALLY SAW THIS TERRIBLE SIGHT
AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CHASM AS WE
WERE ABOUT TO REASCEND ARDIAEUS APPEARED AND SOME OTHER SINNERS MOST
OF WHOM HAD BEEN TYRANTS BUT NOT ALL AND JUST AS THEY FANCIED THAT
THEY WERE RETURNING TO LIFE THE CHASM GAVE A ROAR AND THEN WILD
FIERY LOOKING MEN WHO KNEW THE MEANING OF THE SOUND SEIZED HIM AND
SEVERAL OTHERS AND BOUND THEM HAND AND FOOT AND THREW THEM DOWN AND
DRAGGED THEM ALONG AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD LACERATING THEM AND CARDING
THEM LIKE WOOL AND EXPLAINING TO THE PASSERS BY THAT THEY WERE GOING
TO BE CAST INTO HELL THE GREATEST TERROR OF THE PILGRIMS ASCENDING WAS
LEST THEY SHOULD HEAR THE VOICE AND WHEN THERE WAS SILENCE ONE BY ONE
THEY PASSED UP WITH JOY
TO THESE SUFFERINGS THERE WERE CORRESPONDING
DELIGHTS
ON THE EIGHTH DAY THE SOULS OF THE PILGRIMS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY
AND IN FOUR DAYS CAME TO A SPOT WHENCE THEY LOOKED DOWN UPON A LINE OF
LIGHT IN COLOUR LIKE A RAINBOW ONLY BRIGHTER AND CLEARER
ONE DAY
MORE BROUGHT THEM TO THE PLACE AND THEY SAW THAT THIS WAS THE COLUMN
OF LIGHT WHICH BINDS TOGETHER THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
THE ENDS OF THE COLUMN
WERE FASTENED TO HEAVEN AND FROM THEM HUNG THE DISTAFF OF NECESSITY
ON WHICH ALL THE HEAVENLY BODIES TURNED THE HOOK AND SPINDLE WERE OF
ADAMANT AND THE WHORL OF A MIXED SUBSTANCE
THE WHORL WAS IN FORM
LIKE A NUMBER OF BOXES FITTING INTO ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR EDGES
TURNED UPWARDS MAKING TOGETHER A SINGLE WHORL WHICH WAS PIERCED BY THE
SPINDLE
THE OUTERMOST HAD THE RIM BROADEST AND THE INNER WHORLS WERE
SMALLER AND SMALLER AND HAD THEIR RIMS NARROWER
THE LARGEST THE FIXED
STARS WAS SPANGLED THE SEVENTH THE SUN WAS BRIGHTEST THE EIGHTH
THE MOON SHONE BY THE LIGHT OF THE SEVENTH THE SECOND AND FIFTH
SATURN AND MERCURY WERE MOST LIKE ONE ANOTHER AND YELLOWER THAN THE
EIGHTH THE THIRD JUPITER HAD THE WHITEST LIGHT THE FOURTH MARS
WAS RED THE SIXTH VENUS WAS IN WHITENESS SECOND
THE WHOLE HAD ONE
MOTION BUT WHILE THIS WAS REVOLVING IN ONE DIRECTION THE SEVEN INNER
CIRCLES WERE MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE WITH VARIOUS DEGREES OF SWIFTNESS
AND SLOWNESS
THE SPINDLE TURNED ON THE KNEES OF NECESSITY AND A SIREN
STOOD HYMNING UPON EACH CIRCLE WHILE LACHESIS CLOTHO AND ATROPOS THE
DAUGHTERS OF NECESSITY SAT ON THRONES AT EQUAL INTERVALS SINGING OF
PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE RESPONSIVE TO THE MUSIC OF THE SIRENS CLOTHO
FROM TIME TO TIME GUIDING THE OUTER CIRCLE WITH A TOUCH OF HER RIGHT
HAND ATROPOS WITH HER LEFT HAND TOUCHING AND GUIDING THE INNER CIRCLES
LACHESIS IN TURN PUTTING FORTH HER HAND FROM TIME TO TIME TO GUIDE BOTH
OF THEM
ON THEIR ARRIVAL THE PILGRIMS WENT TO LACHESIS AND THERE WAS
AN INTERPRETER WHO ARRANGED THEM AND TAKING FROM HER KNEES LOTS AND
SAMPLES OF LIVES GOT UP INTO A PULPIT AND SAID 'MORTAL SOULS HEAR
THE WORDS OF LACHESIS THE DAUGHTER OF NECESSITY
A NEW PERIOD OF
MORTAL LIFE HAS BEGUN AND YOU MAY CHOOSE WHAT DIVINITY YOU PLEASE
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHOOSING IS WITH YOU GOD IS BLAMELESS AFTER
SPEAKING THUS HE CAST THE LOTS AMONG THEM AND EACH ONE TOOK UP THE
LOT WHICH FELL NEAR HIM
HE THEN PLACED ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM THE
SAMPLES OF LIVES MANY MORE THAN THE SOULS PRESENT AND THERE WERE ALL
SORTS OF LIVES OF MEN AND OF ANIMALS
THERE WERE TYRANNIES ENDING IN
MISERY AND EXILE AND LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN FAMOUS FOR THEIR DIFFERENT
QUALITIES AND ALSO MIXED LIVES MADE UP OF WEALTH AND POVERTY
SICKNESS AND HEALTH
HERE GLAUCON IS THE GREAT RISK OF HUMAN LIFE AND
THEREFORE THE WHOLE OF EDUCATION SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE ACQUISITION
OF SUCH A KNOWLEDGE AS WILL TEACH A MAN TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND CHOOSE
THE GOOD
HE SHOULD KNOW ALL THE COMBINATIONS WHICH OCCUR IN LIFE OF
BEAUTY WITH POVERTY OR WITH WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE WITH EXTERNAL
GOODS AND AT LAST CHOOSE WITH REFERENCE TO THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
REGARDING THAT ONLY AS THE BETTER LIFE WHICH MAKES MEN BETTER AND
LEAVING THE REST
AND A MAN MUST TAKE WITH HIM AN IRON SENSE OF TRUTH
AND RIGHT INTO THE WORLD BELOW THAT THERE TOO HE MAY REMAIN UNDAZZLED
BY WEALTH OR THE ALLUREMENTS OF EVIL AND BE DETERMINED TO AVOID THE
EXTREMES AND CHOOSE THE MEAN
FOR THIS AS THE MESSENGER REPORTED THE
INTERPRETER TO HAVE SAID IS THE TRUE HAPPINESS OF MAN AND ANY ONE AS
HE PROCLAIMED MAY IF HE CHOOSE WITH UNDERSTANDING HAVE A GOOD LOT
EVEN THOUGH HE COME LAST
'LET NOT THE FIRST BE CARELESS IN HIS CHOICE
NOR THE LAST DESPAIR HE SPOKE AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE WHO HAD
DRAWN THE FIRST LOT CHOSE A TYRANNY HE DID NOT SEE THAT HE WAS FATED TO
DEVOUR HIS OWN CHILDREN AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED HIS MISTAKE HE WEPT
AND BEAT HIS BREAST BLAMING CHANCE AND THE GODS AND ANYBODY RATHER
THAN HIMSELF
HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO HAD COME FROM HEAVEN AND IN HIS
PREVIOUS LIFE HAD BEEN A CITIZEN OF A WELL ORDERED STATE BUT HE HAD
ONLY HABIT AND NO PHILOSOPHY
LIKE MANY ANOTHER HE MADE A BAD CHOICE
BECAUSE HE HAD NO EXPERIENCE OF LIFE WHEREAS THOSE WHO CAME FROM EARTH
AND HAD SEEN TROUBLE WERE NOT IN SUCH A HURRY TO CHOOSE
BUT IF A
MAN HAD FOLLOWED PHILOSOPHY WHILE UPON EARTH AND HAD BEEN MODERATELY
FORTUNATE IN HIS LOT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY BE HAPPY HERE BUT HIS
PILGRIMAGE BOTH FROM AND TO THIS WORLD WOULD BE SMOOTH AND HEAVENLY
NOTHING WAS MORE CURIOUS THAN THE SPECTACLE OF THE CHOICE AT ONCE SAD
AND LAUGHABLE AND WONDERFUL MOST OF THE SOULS ONLY SEEKING TO AVOID
THEIR OWN CONDITION IN A PREVIOUS LIFE
HE SAW THE SOUL OF ORPHEUS
CHANGING INTO A SWAN BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT BE BORN OF A WOMAN THERE WAS
THAMYRAS BECOMING A NIGHTINGALE MUSICAL BIRDS LIKE THE SWAN CHOOSING
TO BE MEN THE TWENTIETH SOUL WHICH WAS THAT OF AJAX PREFERRING THE
LIFE OF A LION TO THAT OF A MAN IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE INJUSTICE WHICH
WAS DONE TO HIM IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE ARMS AND AGAMEMNON FROM A LIKE
ENMITY TO HUMAN NATURE PASSING INTO AN EAGLE
ABOUT THE MIDDLE WAS THE
SOUL OF ATALANTA CHOOSING THE HONOURS OF AN ATHLETE AND NEXT TO HER
EPEUS TAKING THE NATURE OF A WORKWOMAN AMONG THE LAST WAS THERSITES
WHO WAS CHANGING HIMSELF INTO A MONKEY
THITHER THE LAST OF ALL CAME
ODYSSEUS AND SOUGHT THE LOT OF A PRIVATE MAN WHICH LAY NEGLECTED AND
DESPISED AND WHEN HE FOUND IT HE WENT AWAY REJOICING AND SAID THAT IF
HE HAD BEEN FIRST INSTEAD OF LAST HIS CHOICE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME
MEN TOO WERE SEEN PASSING INTO ANIMALS AND WILD AND TAME ANIMALS
CHANGING INTO ONE ANOTHER
WHEN ALL THE SOULS HAD CHOSEN THEY WENT TO LACHESIS WHO SENT WITH EACH
OF THEM THEIR GENIUS OR ATTENDANT TO FULFIL THEIR LOT
HE FIRST OF
ALL BROUGHT THEM UNDER THE HAND OF CLOTHO AND DREW THEM WITHIN THE
REVOLUTION OF THE SPINDLE IMPELLED BY HER HAND FROM HER THEY WERE
CARRIED TO ATROPOS WHO MADE THE THREADS IRREVERSIBLE WHENCE WITHOUT
TURNING ROUND THEY PASSED BENEATH THE THRONE OF NECESSITY AND WHEN
THEY HAD ALL PASSED THEY MOVED ON IN SCORCHING HEAT TO THE PLAIN OF
FORGETFULNESS AND RESTED AT EVENING BY THE RIVER UNMINDFUL WHOSE WATER
COULD NOT BE RETAINED IN ANY VESSEL OF THIS THEY HAD ALL TO DRINK A
CERTAIN QUANTITY SOME OF THEM DRANK MORE THAN WAS REQUIRED AND HE WHO
DRANK FORGOT ALL THINGS
ER HIMSELF WAS PREVENTED FROM DRINKING
WHEN THEY HAD GONE TO REST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERE WERE
THUNDERSTORMS AND EARTHQUAKES AND SUDDENLY THEY WERE ALL DRIVEN DIVERS
WAYS SHOOTING LIKE STARS TO THEIR BIRTH
CONCERNING HIS RETURN TO THE
BODY HE ONLY KNEW THAT AWAKING SUDDENLY IN THE MORNING HE FOUND HIMSELF
LYING ON THE PYRE
THUS GLAUCON THE TALE HAS BEEN SAVED AND WILL BE OUR SALVATION IF WE
BELIEVE THAT THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL AND HOLD FAST TO THE HEAVENLY WAY
OF JUSTICE AND KNOWLEDGE
SO SHALL WE PASS UNDEFILED OVER THE RIVER
OF FORGETFULNESS AND BE DEAR TO OURSELVES AND TO THE GODS AND HAVE
A CROWN OF REWARD AND HAPPINESS BOTH IN THIS WORLD AND ALSO IN THE
MILLENNIAL PILGRIMAGE OF THE OTHER
THE TENTH BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO FALLS INTO TWO DIVISIONS FIRST
RESUMING AN OLD THREAD WHICH HAS BEEN INTERRUPTED SOCRATES ASSAILS THE
POETS WHO NOW THAT THE NATURE OF THE SOUL HAS BEEN ANALYZED ARE
SEEN TO BE VERY FAR GONE FROM THE TRUTH AND SECONDLY HAVING SHOWN THE
REALITY OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE JUST HE DEMANDS THAT APPEARANCE SHALL
BE RESTORED TO HIM AND THEN PROCEEDS TO PROVE THE IMMORTALITY OF THE
SOUL
THE ARGUMENT AS IN THE PHAEDO AND GORGIAS IS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE
VISION OF A FUTURE LIFE
WHY PLATO WHO WAS HIMSELF A POET AND WHOSE DIALOGUES ARE POEMS AND
DRAMAS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HOSTILE TO THE POETS AS A CLASS AND ESPECIALLY
TO THE DRAMATIC POETS WHY HE SHOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT TRUTH MAY
BE EMBODIED IN VERSE AS WELL AS IN PROSE AND THAT THERE ARE SOME
INDEFINABLE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS OF HUMAN LIFE WHICH CAN ONLY BE EXPRESSED
IN POETRY SOME ELEMENTS OF IMAGINATION WHICH ALWAYS ENTWINE WITH
REASON WHY HE SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED EPIC VERSE TO BE INSEPARABLY
ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPURITIES OF THE OLD HELLENIC MYTHOLOGY WHY
HE SHOULD TRY HOMER AND HESIOD BY THE UNFAIR AND PROSAIC TEST OF
UTILITY ARE QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DEBATED AMONGST STUDENTS
OF PLATO
THOUGH UNABLE TO GIVE A COMPLETE ANSWER TO THEM WE MAY
SHOW FIRST THAT HIS VIEWS AROSE NATURALLY OUT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF HIS AGE AND SECONDLY WE MAY ELICIT THE TRUTH AS WELL AS THE ERROR
WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THEM
HE IS THE ENEMY OF THE POETS BECAUSE POETRY WAS DECLINING IN HIS OWN
LIFETIME AND A THEATROCRACY AS HE SAYS IN THE LAWS HAD TAKEN THE
PLACE OF AN INTELLECTUAL ARISTOCRACY
EURIPIDES EXHIBITED THE LAST PHASE
OF THE TRAGIC DRAMA AND IN HIM PLATO SAW THE FRIEND AND APOLOGIST OF
TYRANTS AND THE SOPHIST OF TRAGEDY
THE OLD COMEDY WAS ALMOST EXTINCT
THE NEW HAD NOT YET ARISEN
DRAMATIC AND LYRIC POETRY LIKE EVERY OTHER
BRANCH OF GREEK LITERATURE WAS FALLING UNDER THE POWER OF RHETORIC
THERE WAS NO 'SECOND OR THIRD' TO AESCHYLUS AND SOPHOCLES IN THE
GENERATION WHICH FOLLOWED THEM
ARISTOPHANES IN ONE OF HIS LATER
COMEDIES FROGS SPEAKS OF 'THOUSANDS OF TRAGEDY MAKING PRATTLERS
WHOSE ATTEMPTS AT POETRY HE COMPARES TO THE CHIRPING OF SWALLOWS 'THEIR
GARRULITY WENT FAR BEYOND EURIPIDES 'THEY APPEARED ONCE UPON THE
STAGE AND THERE WAS AN END OF THEM TO A MAN OF GENIUS WHO HAD A
REAL APPRECIATION OF THE GODLIKE AESCHYLUS AND THE NOBLE AND GENTLE
SOPHOCLES THOUGH DISAGREEING WITH SOME PARTS OF THEIR 'THEOLOGY'
REP THESE 'MINOR POETS' MUST HAVE BEEN CONTEMPTIBLE AND INTOLERABLE
THERE IS NO FEELING STRONGER IN THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO THAN A SENSE OF
THE DECLINE AND DECAY BOTH IN LITERATURE AND IN POLITICS WHICH MARKED
HIS OWN AGE
NOR CAN HE HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR ON THE
LICENCE OF ARISTOPHANES NOW AT THE END OF HIS CAREER WHO HAD BEGUN BY
SATIRIZING SOCRATES IN THE CLOUDS AND IN A SIMILAR SPIRIT FORTY YEARS
AFTERWARDS HAD SATIRIZED THE FOUNDERS OF IDEAL COMMONWEALTHS IN HIS
ECCLEZIAZUSAE OR FEMALE PARLIAMENT LAWS
THERE WERE OTHER REASONS FOR THE ANTAGONISM OF PLATO TO POETRY
THE
PROFESSION OF AN ACTOR WAS REGARDED BY HIM AS A DEGRADATION OF HUMAN
NATURE FOR 'ONE MAN IN HIS LIFE' CANNOT 'PLAY MANY PARTS THE
CHARACTERS WHICH THE ACTOR PERFORMS SEEM TO DESTROY HIS OWN CHARACTER
AND TO LEAVE NOTHING WHICH CAN BE TRULY CALLED HIMSELF
NEITHER CAN ANY
MAN LIVE HIS LIFE AND ACT IT
THE ACTOR IS THE SLAVE OF HIS ART NOT THE
MASTER OF IT
TAKING THIS VIEW PLATO IS MORE DECIDED IN HIS EXPULSION OF
THE DRAMATIC THAN OF THE EPIC POETS THOUGH HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT
THE GREEK TRAGEDIANS AFFORDED NOBLE LESSONS AND EXAMPLES OF VIRTUE
AND PATRIOTISM TO WHICH NOTHING IN HOMER CAN BE COMPARED
BUT GREAT
DRAMATIC OR EVEN GREAT RHETORICAL POWER IS HARDLY CONSISTENT WITH
FIRMNESS OR STRENGTH OF MIND AND DRAMATIC TALENT IS OFTEN INCIDENTALLY
ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK OR DISSOLUTE CHARACTER
IN THE TENTH BOOK PLATO INTRODUCES A NEW SERIES OF OBJECTIONS
FIRST
HE SAYS THAT THE POET OR PAINTER IS AN IMITATOR AND IN THE THIRD
DEGREE REMOVED FROM THE TRUTH
HIS CREATIONS ARE NOT TESTED BY RULE AND
MEASURE THEY ARE ONLY APPEARANCES
IN MODERN TIMES WE SHOULD SAY THAT
ART IS NOT MERELY IMITATION BUT RATHER THE EXPRESSION OF THE IDEAL IN
FORMS OF SENSE
EVEN ADOPTING THE HUMBLE IMAGE OF PLATO FROM WHICH
HIS ARGUMENT DERIVES A COLOUR WE SHOULD MAINTAIN THAT THE ARTIST MAY
ENNOBLE THE BED WHICH HE PAINTS BY THE FOLDS OF THE DRAPERY OR BY THE
FEELING OF HOME WHICH HE INTRODUCES AND THERE HAVE BEEN MODERN
PAINTERS WHO HAVE IMPARTED SUCH AN IDEAL INTEREST TO A BLACKSMITH'S OR
A CARPENTER'S SHOP
THE EYE OR MIND WHICH FEELS AS WELL AS SEES CAN GIVE
DIGNITY AND PATHOS TO A RUINED MILL OR A STRAW BUILT SHED REMBRANDT
TO THE HULL OF A VESSEL 'GOING TO ITS LAST HOME' TURNER
STILL MORE
WOULD THIS APPLY TO THE GREATEST WORKS OF ART WHICH SEEM TO BE THE
VISIBLE EMBODIMENT OF THE DIVINE
HAD PLATO BEEN ASKED WHETHER THE ZEUS
OR ATHENE OF PHEIDIAS WAS THE IMITATION OF AN IMITATION ONLY WOULD HE
NOT HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT SOMETHING MORE WAS TO BE FOUND IN
THEM THAN IN THE FORM OF ANY MORTAL AND THAT THE RULE OF PROPORTION
TO WHICH THEY CONFORMED WAS 'HIGHER FAR THAN ANY GEOMETRY OR ARITHMETIC
COULD EXPRESS STATESMAN
AGAIN PLATO OBJECTS TO THE IMITATIVE ARTS THAT THEY EXPRESS THE
EMOTIONAL RATHER THAN THE RATIONAL PART OF HUMAN NATURE
HE DOES NOT
ADMIT ARISTOTLE'S THEORY THAT TRAGEDY OR OTHER SERIOUS IMITATIONS ARE
A PURGATION OF THE PASSIONS BY PITY AND FEAR TO HIM THEY APPEAR ONLY TO
AFFORD THE OPPORTUNITY OF INDULGING THEM
YET WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
WE MAY SOMETIMES CURE DISORDERED EMOTIONS BY GIVING EXPRESSION TO THEM
AND THAT THEY OFTEN GAIN STRENGTH WHEN PENT UP WITHIN OUR OWN BREAST
IT IS NOT EVERY INDULGENCE OF THE FEELINGS WHICH IS TO BE CONDEMNED
FOR THERE MAY BE A GRATIFICATION OF THE HIGHER AS WELL AS OF THE
LOWER THOUGHTS WHICH ARE TOO DEEP OR TOO SAD TO BE EXPRESSED BY
OURSELVES MAY FIND AN UTTERANCE IN THE WORDS OF POETS
EVERY ONE WOULD
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THEY WERE CONSOLED AND
ELEVATED BY BEAUTIFUL MUSIC OR BY THE SUBLIMITY OF ARCHITECTURE OR BY
THE PEACEFULNESS OF NATURE
PLATO HAS HIMSELF ADMITTED IN THE EARLIER
PART OF THE REPUBLIC THAT THE ARTS MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF HARMONIZING
AS WELL AS OF ENERVATING THE MIND BUT IN THE TENTH BOOK HE REGARDS THEM
THROUGH A STOIC OR PURITAN MEDIUM
HE ASKS ONLY 'WHAT GOOD HAVE THEY
DONE AND IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE REPLY THAT 'THEY HAVE GIVEN
INNOCENT PLEASURE TO MANKIND
HE TELLS US THAT HE REJOICES IN THE BANISHMENT OF THE POETS SINCE HE
HAS FOUND BY THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOUL THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED WITH THE
INFERIOR FACULTIES
HE MEANS TO SAY THAT THE HIGHER FACULTIES HAVE TO DO
WITH UNIVERSALS THE LOWER WITH PARTICULARS OF SENSE
THE POETS ARE ON
A LEVEL WITH THEIR OWN AGE BUT NOT ON A LEVEL WITH SOCRATES AND PLATO
AND HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT HOMER AND HESIOD COULD NOT BE MADE A RULE OF
LIFE BY ANY PROCESS OF LEGITIMATE INTERPRETATION HIS IRONICAL USE OF
THEM IS IN FACT A DENIAL OF THEIR AUTHORITY HE SAW TOO THAT THE
POETS WERE NOT CRITICS AS HE SAYS IN THE APOLOGY 'ANY ONE WAS A BETTER
INTERPRETER OF THEIR WRITINGS THAN THEY WERE THEMSELVES
HE HIMSELF
CEASED TO BE A POET WHEN HE BECAME A DISCIPLE OF SOCRATES THOUGH AS HE
TELLS US OF SOLON 'HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THEM IF
HE HAD NOT BEEN DETERRED BY OTHER PURSUITS' TIM THUS FROM MANY POINTS
OF VIEW THERE IS AN ANTAGONISM BETWEEN PLATO AND THE POETS WHICH WAS
FORESHADOWED TO HIM IN THE OLD QUARREL BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY
THE POETS AS HE SAYS IN THE PROTAGORAS WERE THE SOPHISTS OF THEIR DAY
AND HIS DISLIKE OF THE ONE CLASS IS REFLECTED ON THE OTHER
HE REGARDS
THEM BOTH AS THE ENEMIES OF REASONING AND ABSTRACTION THOUGH IN THE
CASE OF EURIPIDES MORE WITH REFERENCE TO HIS IMMORAL SENTIMENTS ABOUT
TYRANTS AND THE LIKE
FOR PLATO IS THE PROPHET WHO 'CAME INTO THE WORLD
TO CONVINCE MEN' FIRST OF THE FALLIBILITY OF SENSE AND OPINION AND
SECONDLY OF THE REALITY OF ABSTRACT IDEAS
WHATEVER STRANGENESS THERE
MAY BE IN MODERN TIMES IN OPPOSING PHILOSOPHY TO POETRY WHICH TO US
SEEM TO HAVE SO MANY ELEMENTS IN COMMON THE STRANGENESS WILL DISAPPEAR
IF WE CONCEIVE OF POETRY AS ALLIED TO SENSE AND OF PHILOSOPHY AS
EQUIVALENT TO THOUGHT AND ABSTRACTION
UNFORTUNATELY THE VERY WORD
'IDEA WHICH TO PLATO IS EXPRESSIVE OF THE MOST REAL OF ALL THINGS IS
ASSOCIATED IN OUR MINDS WITH AN ELEMENT OF SUBJECTIVENESS AND UNREALITY
WE MAY NOTE ALSO HOW HE DIFFERS FROM ARISTOTLE WHO DECLARES POETRY TO
BE TRUER THAN HISTORY FOR THE OPPOSITE REASON BECAUSE IT IS CONCERNED
WITH UNIVERSALS NOT LIKE HISTORY WITH PARTICULARS POET
THE THINGS WHICH ARE SEEN ARE OPPOSED IN SCRIPTURE TO THE THINGS WHICH
ARE UNSEEN THEY ARE EQUALLY OPPOSED IN PLATO TO UNIVERSALS AND IDEAS
TO HIM ALL PARTICULARS APPEAR TO BE FLOATING ABOUT IN A WORLD OF SENSE
THEY HAVE A TAINT OF ERROR OR EVEN OF EVIL
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN
SEEING THAT THIS IS AN ILLUSION FOR THERE IS NO MORE ERROR OR VARIATION
IN AN INDIVIDUAL MAN HORSE BED ETC THAN IN THE CLASS MAN HORSE
BED ETC NOR IS THE TRUTH WHICH IS DISPLAYED IN INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES
LESS CERTAIN THAN THAT WHICH IS CONVEYED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF
IDEAS
BUT PLATO WHO IS DEEPLY IMPRESSED WITH THE REAL IMPORTANCE OF
UNIVERSALS AS INSTRUMENTS OF THOUGHT ATTRIBUTES TO THEM AN ESSENTIAL
TRUTH WHICH IS IMAGINARY AND UNREAL FOR UNIVERSALS MAY BE OFTEN FALSE
AND PARTICULARS TRUE
HAD HE ATTAINED TO ANY CLEAR CONCEPTION OF THE
INDIVIDUAL WHICH IS THE SYNTHESIS OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THE PARTICULAR
OR HAD HE BEEN ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN OPINION AND SENSATION WHICH
THE AMBIGUITY OF THE WORDS GREEK AND THE LIKE TENDED TO CONFUSE HE
WOULD NOT HAVE DENIED TRUTH TO THE PARTICULARS OF SENSE
BUT THE POETS ARE ALSO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF FALSEHOOD AND FEIGNING
IN ALL DEPARTMENTS OF LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE THE SOPHISTS AND
RHETORICIANS OF THE GORGIAS AND PHAEDRUS THEY ARE THE FALSE PRIESTS
FALSE PROPHETS LYING SPIRITS ENCHANTERS OF THE WORLD
THERE IS ANOTHER
COUNT PUT INTO THE INDICTMENT AGAINST THEM BY PLATO THAT THEY ARE
THE FRIENDS OF THE TYRANT AND BASK IN THE SUNSHINE OF HIS PATRONAGE
DESPOTISM IN ALL AGES HAS HAD AN APPARATUS OF FALSE IDEAS AND FALSE
TEACHERS AT ITS SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF MODERN EUROPE AS WELL AS OF
GREECE AND ROME
FOR NO GOVERNMENT OF MEN DEPENDS SOLELY UPON FORCE
WITHOUT SOME CORRUPTION OF LITERATURE AND MORALS SOME APPEAL TO THE
IMAGINATION OF THE MASSES SOME PRETENCE TO THE FAVOUR OF HEAVEN SOME
ELEMENT OF GOOD GIVING POWER TO EVIL TYRANNY EVEN FOR A SHORT TIME
CANNOT BE MAINTAINED
THE GREEK TYRANTS WERE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE
IMPORTANCE OF AWAKENING IN THEIR CAUSE A PSEUDO HELLENIC FEELING THEY
WERE PROUD OF SUCCESSES AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES THEY WERE NOT DEVOID OF
THE LOVE OF LITERATURE AND ART
PLATO IS THINKING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
OF GREEK POETS WHO HAD GRACED THE COURTS OF DIONYSIUS OR ARCHELAUS AND
THE OLD SPIRIT OF FREEDOM IS ROUSED WITHIN HIM AT THEIR PROSTITUTION OF
THE TRAGIC MUSE IN THE PRAISES OF TYRANNY
BUT HIS PROPHETIC EYE EXTENDS
BEYOND THEM TO THE FALSE TEACHERS OF OTHER AGES WHO ARE THE CREATURES OF
THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH THEY LIVE
HE COMPARES THE CORRUPTION OF HIS
CONTEMPORARIES WITH THE IDEA OF A PERFECT SOCIETY AND GATHERS UP
INTO ONE MASS OF EVIL THE EVILS AND ERRORS OF MANKIND TO HIM THEY ARE
PERSONIFIED IN THE RHETORICIANS SOPHISTS POETS RULERS WHO DECEIVE AND
GOVERN THE WORLD
A FURTHER OBJECTION WHICH PLATO MAKES TO POETRY AND THE IMITATIVE
ARTS IS THAT THEY EXCITE THE EMOTIONS
HERE THE MODERN READER WILL BE
DISPOSED TO INTRODUCE A DISTINCTION WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE ESCAPED HIM
FOR THE EMOTIONS ARE NEITHER BAD NOR GOOD IN THEMSELVES AND ARE NOT
MOST LIKELY TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE ATTEMPT TO ERADICATE THEM BUT BY
THE MODERATE INDULGENCE OF THEM
AND THE VOCATION OF ART IS TO PRESENT
THOUGHT IN THE FORM OF FEELING TO ENLIST THE FEELINGS ON THE SIDE OF
REASON TO INSPIRE EVEN FOR A MOMENT COURAGE OR RESIGNATION PERHAPS TO
SUGGEST A SENSE OF INFINITY AND ETERNITY IN A WAY WHICH MERE LANGUAGE IS
INCAPABLE OF ATTAINING
TRUE THE SAME POWER WHICH IN THE PURER AGE OF
ART EMBODIES GODS AND HEROES ONLY MAY BE MADE TO EXPRESS THE VOLUPTUOUS
IMAGE OF A CORINTHIAN COURTEZAN
BUT THIS ONLY SHOWS THAT ART LIKE
OTHER OUTWARD THINGS MAY BE TURNED TO GOOD AND ALSO TO EVIL AND IS NOT
MORE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE HIGHER THAN WITH THE LOWER PART OF THE
SOUL
ALL IMITATIVE ART IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND THEREFORE
NECESSARILY PARTAKES OF THE NATURE OF A COMPROMISE
SOMETHING OF IDEAL
TRUTH IS SACRIFICED FOR THE SAKE OF THE REPRESENTATION AND SOMETHING IN
THE EXACTNESS OF THE REPRESENTATION IS SACRIFICED TO THE IDEAL
STILL
WORKS OF ART HAVE A PERMANENT ELEMENT THEY IDEALIZE AND DETAIN THE
PASSING THOUGHT AND ARE THE INTERMEDIATES BETWEEN SENSE AND IDEAS
IN THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE HUMAN MIND POETRY AND OTHER FORMS OF
FICTION MAY CERTAINLY BE REGARDED AS A GOOD
BUT WE CAN ALSO IMAGINE THE
EXISTENCE OF AN AGE IN WHICH A SEVERER CONCEPTION OF TRUTH HAS EITHER
BANISHED OR TRANSFORMED THEM
AT ANY RATE WE MUST ADMIT THAT THEY HOLD
A DIFFERENT PLACE AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY
IN THE
INFANCY OF MANKIND POETRY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PROVERBS IS THE
WHOLE OF LITERATURE AND THE ONLY INSTRUMENT OF INTELLECTUAL CULTURE IN
MODERN TIMES SHE IS THE SHADOW OR ECHO OF HER FORMER SELF AND APPEARS
TO HAVE A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE
MILTON IN HIS DAY DOUBTED WHETHER AN
EPIC POEM WAS ANY LONGER POSSIBLE
AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST REMEMBER
THAT WHAT PLATO WOULD HAVE CALLED THE CHARMS OF POETRY HAVE BEEN PARTLY
TRANSFERRED TO PROSE HE HIMSELF STATESMAN ADMITS RHETORIC TO BE THE
HANDMAIDEN OF POLITICS AND PROPOSES TO FIND IN THE STRAIN OF LAW LAWS
A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE OLD POETS
AMONG OURSELVES THE CREATIVE POWER SEEMS
OFTEN TO BE GROWING WEAKER AND SCIENTIFIC FACT TO BE MORE ENGROSSING
AND OVERPOWERING TO THE MIND THAN FORMERLY
THE ILLUSION OF THE FEELINGS
COMMONLY CALLED LOVE HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE INSPIRING INFLUENCE OF
MODERN POETRY AND ROMANCE AND HAS EXERCISED A HUMANIZING IF NOT A
STRENGTHENING INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD
BUT MAY NOT THE STIMULUS WHICH
LOVE HAS GIVEN TO FANCY BE SOME DAY EXHAUSTED THE MODERN ENGLISH NOVEL
WHICH IS THE MOST POPULAR OF ALL FORMS OF READING IS NOT MORE THAN A
CENTURY OR TWO OLD WILL THE TALE OF LOVE A HUNDRED YEARS HENCE AFTER
SO MANY THOUSAND VARIATIONS OF THE SAME THEME BE STILL RECEIVED WITH
UNABATED INTEREST
ART CANNOT CLAIM TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION AND MAY
OFTEN CORRUPT THEM
IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE A MENTAL STATE IN WHICH
ALL ARTISTIC REPRESENTATIONS ARE REGARDED AS A FALSE AND IMPERFECT
EXPRESSION EITHER OF THE RELIGIOUS IDEAL OR OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAL
THE FAIREST FORMS MAY BE REVOLTING IN CERTAIN MOODS OF MIND AS IS
PROVED BY THE FACT THAT THE MAHOMETANS AND MANY SECTS OF CHRISTIANS
HAVE RENOUNCED THE USE OF PICTURES AND IMAGES
THE BEGINNING OF A GREAT
RELIGION WHETHER CHRISTIAN OR GENTILE HAS NOT BEEN 'WOOD OR STONE
BUT A SPIRIT MOVING IN THE HEARTS OF MEN
THE DISCIPLES HAVE MET IN A
LARGE UPPER ROOM OR IN 'HOLES AND CAVES OF THE EARTH' IN THE SECOND OR
THIRD GENERATION THEY HAVE HAD MOSQUES TEMPLES CHURCHES MONASTERIES
AND THE REVIVAL OR REFORM OF RELIGIONS LIKE THE FIRST REVELATION
OF THEM HAS COME FROM WITHIN AND HAS GENERALLY DISREGARDED EXTERNAL
CEREMONIES AND ACCOMPANIMENTS
BUT POETRY AND ART MAY ALSO BE THE EXPRESSION OF THE HIGHEST TRUTH AND
THE PUREST SENTIMENT
PLATO HIMSELF SEEMS TO WAVER BETWEEN TWO OPPOSITE
VIEWS WHEN AS IN THE THIRD BOOK HE INSISTS THAT YOUTH SHOULD BE
BROUGHT UP AMID WHOLESOME IMAGERY AND AGAIN IN BOOK X WHEN HE BANISHES
THE POETS FROM HIS REPUBLIC
ADMITTING THAT THE ARTS WHICH SOME OF US
ALMOST DEIFY HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF THEIR HIGHER AIM WE MUST ADMIT ON
THE OTHER HAND THAT TO BANISH IMAGINATION WHOLLY WOULD BE SUICIDAL AS
WELL AS IMPOSSIBLE
FOR NATURE TOO IS A FORM OF ART AND A BREATH OF
THE FRESH AIR OR A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE VARYING LANDSCAPE WOULD IN AN
INSTANT REVIVE AND REILLUMINE THE EXTINGUISHED SPARK OF POETRY IN THE
HUMAN BREAST
IN THE LOWER STAGES OF CIVILIZATION IMAGINATION MORE THAN
REASON DISTINGUISHES MAN FROM THE ANIMALS AND TO BANISH ART WOULD BE
TO BANISH THOUGHT TO BANISH LANGUAGE TO BANISH THE EXPRESSION OF
ALL TRUTH
NO RELIGION IS WHOLLY DEVOID OF EXTERNAL FORMS EVEN THE
MAHOMETAN WHO RENOUNCES THE USE OF PICTURES AND IMAGES HAS A TEMPLE IN
WHICH HE WORSHIPS THE MOST HIGH AS SOLEMN AND BEAUTIFUL AS ANY GREEK OR
CHRISTIAN BUILDING
FEELING TOO AND THOUGHT ARE NOT REALLY OPPOSED FOR
HE WHO THINKS MUST FEEL BEFORE HE CAN EXECUTE
AND THE HIGHEST THOUGHTS
WHEN THEY BECOME FAMILIARIZED TO US ARE ALWAYS TENDING TO PASS INTO THE
FORM OF FEELING
PLATO DOES NOT SERIOUSLY INTEND TO EXPEL POETS FROM LIFE AND SOCIETY
BUT HE FEELS STRONGLY THE UNREALITY OF THEIR WRITINGS HE IS PROTESTING
AGAINST THE DEGENERACY OF POETRY IN HIS OWN DAY AS WE MIGHT PROTEST
AGAINST THE WANT OF SERIOUS PURPOSE IN MODERN FICTION AGAINST THE
UNSEEMLINESS OR EXTRAVAGANCE OF SOME OF OUR POETS OR NOVELISTS
AGAINST THE TIME SERVING OF PREACHERS OR PUBLIC WRITERS AGAINST THE
REGARDLESSNESS OF TRUTH WHICH TO THE EYE OF THE PHILOSOPHER SEEMS TO
CHARACTERIZE THE GREATER PART OF THE WORLD
FOR WE TOO HAVE REASON TO
COMPLAIN THAT OUR POETS AND NOVELISTS 'PAINT INFERIOR TRUTH' AND 'ARE
CONCERNED WITH THE INFERIOR PART OF THE SOUL' THAT THE READERS OF THEM
BECOME WHAT THEY READ AND ARE INJURIOUSLY AFFECTED BY THEM
AND WE LOOK
IN VAIN FOR THAT HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF WHICH PLATO SPEAKS 'THE BEAUTY
WHICH MEETS THE SENSE LIKE A BREEZE AND IMPERCEPTIBLY DRAWS THE SOUL
EVEN IN CHILDHOOD INTO HARMONY WITH THE BEAUTY OF REASON
FOR THERE MIGHT BE A POETRY WHICH WOULD BE THE HYMN OF DIVINE
PERFECTION THE HARMONY OF GOODNESS AND TRUTH AMONG MEN A STRAIN WHICH
SHOULD RENEW THE YOUTH OF THE WORLD AND BRING BACK THE AGES IN WHICH
THE POET WAS MAN'S ONLY TEACHER AND BEST FRIEND WHICH WOULD FIND
MATERIALS IN THE LIVING PRESENT AS WELL AS IN THE ROMANCE OF THE
PAST AND MIGHT SUBDUE TO THE FAIREST FORMS OF SPEECH AND VERSE THE
INTRACTABLE MATERIALS OF MODERN CIVILISATION WHICH MIGHT ELICIT THE
SIMPLE PRINCIPLES OR AS PLATO WOULD HAVE CALLED THEM THE ESSENTIAL
FORMS OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE OUT OF THE VARIETY OF OPINION AND THE
COMPLEXITY OF MODERN SOCIETY WHICH WOULD PRESERVE ALL THE GOOD OF EACH
GENERATION AND LEAVE THE BAD UNSUNG WHICH SHOULD BE BASED NOT ON VAIN
LONGINGS OR FAINT IMAGININGS BUT ON A CLEAR INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF
MAN
THEN THE TALE OF LOVE MIGHT BEGIN AGAIN IN POETRY OR PROSE TWO IN
ONE UNITED IN THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE OR THE SERVICE OF GOD AND MAN
AND FEELINGS OF LOVE MIGHT STILL BE THE INCENTIVE TO GREAT THOUGHTS
AND HEROIC DEEDS AS IN THE DAYS OF DANTE OR PETRARCH AND MANY TYPES
OF MANLY AND WOMANLY BEAUTY MIGHT APPEAR AMONG US RISING ABOVE THE
ORDINARY LEVEL OF HUMANITY AND MANY LIVES WHICH WERE LIKE POEMS LAWS
BE NOT ONLY WRITTEN BUT LIVED BY US
A FEW SUCH STRAINS HAVE BEEN
HEARD AMONG MEN IN THE TRAGEDIES OF AESCHYLUS AND SOPHOCLES WHOM PLATO
QUOTES NOT AS HOMER IS QUOTED BY HIM IN IRONY BUT WITH DEEP AND
SERIOUS APPROVAL IN THE POETRY OF MILTON AND WORDSWORTH AND IN
PASSAGES OF OTHER ENGLISH POETS FIRST AND ABOVE ALL IN THE HEBREW
PROPHETS AND PSALMISTS
SHAKESPEARE HAS TAUGHT US HOW GREAT MEN SHOULD
SPEAK AND ACT HE HAS DRAWN CHARACTERS OF A WONDERFUL PURITY AND DEPTH
HE HAS ENNOBLED THE HUMAN MIND BUT LIKE HOMER REP HE 'HAS LEFT
NO WAY OF LIFE THE NEXT GREATEST POET OF MODERN TIMES GOETHE IS
CONCERNED WITH 'A LOWER DEGREE OF TRUTH' HE PAINTS THE WORLD AS A STAGE
ON WHICH 'ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE MERELY PLAYERS' HE CULTIVATES LIFE
AS AN ART BUT HE FURNISHES NO IDEALS OF TRUTH AND ACTION
THE POET MAY
REBEL AGAINST ANY ATTEMPT TO SET LIMITS TO HIS FANCY AND HE MAY
ARGUE TRULY THAT MORALIZING IN VERSE IS NOT POETRY
POSSIBLY LIKE
MEPHISTOPHELES IN FAUST HE MAY RETALIATE ON HIS ADVERSARIES
BUT THE
PHILOSOPHER WILL STILL BE JUSTIFIED IN ASKING 'HOW MAY THE HEAVENLY
GIFT OF POESY BE DEVOTED TO THE GOOD OF MANKIND
RETURNING TO PLATO WE MAY OBSERVE THAT A SIMILAR MIXTURE OF TRUTH
AND ERROR APPEARS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE ARGUMENT
HE IS AWARE OF THE
ABSURDITY OF MANKIND FRAMING THEIR WHOLE LIVES ACCORDING TO HOMER JUST
AS IN THE PHAEDRUS HE INTIMATES THE ABSURDITY OF INTERPRETING MYTHOLOGY
UPON RATIONAL PRINCIPLES BOTH THESE WERE THE MODERN TENDENCIES OF HIS
OWN AGE WHICH HE DESERVEDLY RIDICULES
ON THE OTHER HAND HIS ARGUMENT
THAT HOMER IF HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO TEACH MANKIND ANYTHING WORTH KNOWING
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED BY THEM TO GO ABOUT BEGGING AS A RHAPSODIST
IS BOTH FALSE AND CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF PLATO REP
IT MAY BE
COMPARED WITH THOSE OTHER PARADOXES OF THE GORGIAS THAT 'NO STATESMAN
WAS EVER UNJUSTLY PUT TO DEATH BY THE CITY OF WHICH HE WAS THE HEAD'
AND THAT 'NO SOPHIST WAS EVER DEFRAUDED BY HIS PUPILS' GORG
THE ARGUMENT FOR IMMORTALITY SEEMS TO REST ON THE ABSOLUTE DUALISM OF
SOUL AND BODY
ADMITTING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL WE KNOW OF NO FORCE
WHICH IS ABLE TO PUT AN END TO HER
VICE IS HER OWN PROPER EVIL AND IF
SHE CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY THAT SHE CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY ANY OTHER
YET PLATO HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SOUL MAY BE SO OVERGROWN BY THE
INCRUSTATIONS OF EARTH AS TO LOSE HER ORIGINAL FORM AND IN THE TIMAEUS
HE RECOGNIZES MORE STRONGLY THAN IN THE REPUBLIC THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE
BODY HAS OVER THE MIND DENYING EVEN THE VOLUNTARINESS OF HUMAN ACTIONS
ON THE GROUND THAT THEY PROCEED FROM PHYSICAL STATES TIM
IN THE
REPUBLIC AS ELSEWHERE HE WAVERS BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL SOUL WHICH HAS
TO BE RESTORED AND THE CHARACTER WHICH IS DEVELOPED BY TRAINING AND
EDUCATION
THE VISION OF ANOTHER WORLD IS ASCRIBED TO ER THE SON OF ARMENIUS WHO
IS SAID BY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA TO HAVE BEEN ZOROASTER
THE TALE
HAS CERTAINLY AN ORIENTAL CHARACTER AND MAY BE COMPARED WITH THE
PILGRIMAGES OF THE SOUL IN THE ZEND AVESTA HAUG AVESTA
BUT NO TRACE
OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH ZOROASTER IS FOUND ELSEWHERE IN PLATO'S WRITINGS
AND THERE IS NO REASON FOR GIVING HIM THE NAME OF ER THE PAMPHYLIAN
THE
PHILOSOPHY OF HERACLEITUS CANNOT BE SHOWN TO BE BORROWED FROM ZOROASTER
AND STILL LESS THE MYTHS OF PLATO
THE LOCAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE VISION IS LESS DISTINCT THAN THAT OF THE
PHAEDRUS AND PHAEDO
ASTRONOMY IS MINGLED WITH SYMBOLISM AND MYTHOLOGY
THE GREAT SPHERE OF HEAVEN IS REPRESENTED UNDER THE SYMBOL OF A CYLINDER
OR BOX CONTAINING THE SEVEN ORBITS OF THE PLANETS AND THE FIXED STARS
THIS IS SUSPENDED FROM AN AXIS OR SPINDLE WHICH TURNS ON THE KNEES OF
NECESSITY THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE SEVEN ORBITS CONTAINED IN THE CYLINDER
ARE GUIDED BY THE FATES AND THEIR HARMONIOUS MOTION PRODUCES THE MUSIC
OF THE SPHERES
THROUGH THE INNERMOST OR EIGHTH OF THESE WHICH IS THE
MOON IS PASSED THE SPINDLE BUT IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THIS IS THE
CONTINUATION OF THE COLUMN OF LIGHT FROM WHICH THE PILGRIMS CONTEMPLATE
THE HEAVENS THE WORDS OF PLATO IMPLY THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED BUT
NOT THE SAME
THE COLUMN ITSELF IS CLEARLY NOT OF ADAMANT
THE SPINDLE
WHICH IS OF ADAMANT IS FASTENED TO THE ENDS OF THE CHAINS WHICH
EXTEND TO THE MIDDLE OF THE COLUMN OF LIGHT THIS COLUMN IS SAID TO HOLD
TOGETHER THE HEAVEN BUT WHETHER IT HANGS FROM THE SPINDLE OR IS AT
RIGHT ANGLES TO IT IS NOT EXPLAINED
THE CYLINDER CONTAINING THE ORBITS
OF THE STARS IS ALMOST AS MUCH A SYMBOL AS THE FIGURE OF NECESSITY
TURNING THE SPINDLE FOR THE OUTERMOST RIM IS THE SPHERE OF THE FIXED
STARS AND NOTHING IS SAID ABOUT THE INTERVALS OF SPACE WHICH DIVIDE THE
PATHS OF THE STARS IN THE HEAVENS
THE DESCRIPTION IS BOTH A PICTURE AND
AN ORRERY AND THEREFORE IS NECESSARILY INCONSISTENT WITH ITSELF
THE
COLUMN OF LIGHT IS NOT THE MILKY WAY WHICH IS NEITHER STRAIGHT NOR
LIKE A RAINBOW BUT THE IMAGINARY AXIS OF THE EARTH
THIS IS COMPARED
TO THE RAINBOW IN RESPECT NOT OF FORM BUT OF COLOUR AND NOT TO THE
UNDERGIRDERS OF A TRIREME BUT TO THE STRAIGHT ROPE RUNNING FROM PROW TO
STERN IN WHICH THE UNDERGIRDERS MEET
THE ORRERY OR PICTURE OF THE HEAVENS GIVEN IN THE REPUBLIC DIFFERS IN
ITS MODE OF REPRESENTATION FROM THE CIRCLES OF THE SAME AND OF THE
OTHER IN THE TIMAEUS
IN BOTH THE FIXED STARS ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE
PLANETS AND THEY MOVE IN ORBITS WITHOUT THEM ALTHOUGH IN AN OPPOSITE
DIRECTION IN THE REPUBLIC AS IN THE TIMAEUS THEY ARE ALL MOVING ROUND
THE AXIS OF THE WORLD
BUT WE ARE NOT CERTAIN THAT IN THE FORMER THEY
ARE MOVING ROUND THE EARTH
NO DISTINCT MENTION IS MADE IN THE REPUBLIC
OF THE CIRCLES OF THE SAME AND OTHER ALTHOUGH BOTH IN THE TIMAEUS AND
IN THE REPUBLIC THE MOTION OF THE FIXED STARS IS SUPPOSED TO COINCIDE
WITH THE MOTION OF THE WHOLE
THE RELATIVE THICKNESS OF THE RIMS IS
PERHAPS DESIGNED TO EXPRESS THE RELATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS
PLATO PROBABLY INTENDED TO REPRESENT THE EARTH FROM WHICH ER AND HIS
COMPANIONS ARE VIEWING THE HEAVENS AS STATIONARY IN PLACE BUT WHETHER
OR NOT HERSELF REVOLVING UNLESS THIS IS IMPLIED IN THE REVOLUTION OF
THE AXIS IS UNCERTAIN TIMAEUS
THE SPECTATOR MAY BE SUPPOSED TO LOOK
AT THE HEAVENLY BODIES EITHER FROM ABOVE OR BELOW
THE EARTH IS A SORT
OF EARTH AND HEAVEN IN ONE LIKE THE HEAVEN OF THE PHAEDRUS ON THE BACK
OF WHICH THE SPECTATOR GOES OUT TO TAKE A PEEP AT THE STARS AND IS BORNE
ROUND IN THE REVOLUTION
THERE IS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE EQUATOR AND
THE ECLIPTIC
BUT PLATO IS NO DOUBT LED TO IMAGINE THAT THE PLANETS HAVE
AN OPPOSITE MOTION TO THAT OF THE FIXED STARS IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR
THEIR APPEARANCES IN THE HEAVENS
IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MEADOW AND
THE RETRIBUTION OF THE GOOD AND EVIL AFTER DEATH THERE ARE TRACES OF
HOMER
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE AXIS AS A SPINDLE AND OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES AS
FORMING A WHOLE PARTLY ARISES OUT OF THE ATTEMPT TO CONNECT THE MOTIONS
OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES WITH THE MYTHOLOGICAL IMAGE OF THE WEB OR
WEAVING OF THE FATES
THE GIVING OF THE LOTS THE WEAVING OF THEM
AND THE MAKING OF THEM IRREVERSIBLE WHICH ARE ASCRIBED TO THE THREE
FATES LACHESIS CLOTHO ATROPOS ARE OBVIOUSLY DERIVED FROM THEIR
NAMES
THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE IN HUMAN LIFE IS INDICATED BY THE ORDER OF
THE LOTS
BUT CHANCE HOWEVER ADVERSE MAY BE OVERCOME BY THE WISDOM
OF MAN IF HE KNOWS HOW TO CHOOSE ARIGHT THERE IS A WORSE ENEMY TO MAN
THAN CHANCE THIS ENEMY IS HIMSELF
HE WHO WAS MODERATELY FORTUNATE IN
THE NUMBER OF THE LOT EVEN THE VERY LAST COMER MIGHT HAVE A GOOD LIFE
IF HE CHOSE WITH WISDOM
AND AS PLATO DOES NOT LIKE TO MAKE AN ASSERTION
WHICH IS UNPROVEN HE MORE THAN CONFIRMS THIS STATEMENT A FEW SENTENCES
AFTERWARDS BY THE EXAMPLE OF ODYSSEUS WHO CHOSE LAST
BUT THE VIRTUE
WHICH IS FOUNDED ON HABIT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE A MAN TO CHOOSE
HE MUST ADD TO VIRTUE KNOWLEDGE IF HE IS TO ACT RIGHTLY WHEN PLACED
IN NEW CIRCUMSTANCES
THE ROUTINE OF GOOD ACTIONS AND GOOD HABITS IS
AN INFERIOR SORT OF GOODNESS AND AS COLERIDGE SAYS 'COMMON SENSE
IS INTOLERABLE WHICH IS NOT BASED ON METAPHYSICS SO PLATO WOULD HAVE
SAID 'HABIT IS WORTHLESS WHICH IS NOT BASED UPON PHILOSOPHY
THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL TO REFUSE THE EVIL AND TO CHOOSE THE GOOD IS
DISTINCTLY ASSERTED
'VIRTUE IS FREE AND AS A MAN HONOURS OR DISHONOURS
HER HE WILL HAVE MORE OR LESS OF HER THE LIFE OF MAN IS 'ROUNDED'
BY NECESSITY THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR TO BIRTH WHICH AFFECT HIM
POL
BUT WITHIN THE WALLS OF NECESSITY THERE IS AN OPEN SPACE IN
WHICH HE IS HIS OWN MASTER AND CAN STUDY FOR HIMSELF THE EFFECTS WHICH
THE VARIOUSLY COMPOUNDED GIFTS OF NATURE OR FORTUNE HAVE UPON THE SOUL
AND ACT ACCORDINGLY
ALL MEN CANNOT HAVE THE FIRST CHOICE IN EVERYTHING
BUT THE LOT OF ALL MEN IS GOOD ENOUGH IF THEY CHOOSE WISELY AND WILL
LIVE DILIGENTLY
THE VERISIMILITUDE WHICH IS GIVEN TO THE PILGRIMAGE OF A THOUSAND YEARS
BY THE INTIMATION THAT ARDIAEUS HAD LIVED A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE
THE COINCIDENCE OF ER COMING TO LIFE ON THE TWELFTH DAY AFTER HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DEAD WITH THE SEVEN DAYS WHICH THE PILGRIMS PASSED
IN THE MEADOW AND THE FOUR DAYS DURING WHICH THEY JOURNEYED TO THE
COLUMN OF LIGHT THE PRECISION WITH WHICH THE SOUL IS MENTIONED WHO
CHOSE THE TWENTIETH LOT THE PASSING REMARKS THAT THERE WAS NO DEFINITE
CHARACTER AMONG THE SOULS AND THAT THE SOULS WHICH HAD CHOSEN ILL
BLAMED ANY ONE RATHER THAN THEMSELVES OR THAT SOME OF THE SOULS DRANK
MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY OF THE WATERS OF FORGETFULNESS WHILE ER HIMSELF
WAS HINDERED FROM DRINKING THE DESIRE OF ODYSSEUS TO REST AT LAST
UNLIKE THE CONCEPTION OF HIM IN DANTE AND TENNYSON THE FEIGNED
IGNORANCE OF HOW ER RETURNED TO THE BODY WHEN THE OTHER SOULS WENT
SHOOTING LIKE STARS TO THEIR BIRTH ADD GREATLY TO THE PROBABILITY OF
THE NARRATIVE
THEY ARE SUCH TOUCHES OF NATURE AS THE ART OF DEFOE
MIGHT HAVE INTRODUCED WHEN HE WISHED TO WIN CREDIBILITY FOR MARVELS AND
APPARITIONS
THERE STILL REMAIN TO BE CONSIDERED SOME POINTS WHICH HAVE BEEN
INTENTIONALLY RESERVED TO THE END 1 THE JANUS LIKE CHARACTER OF THE
REPUBLIC WHICH PRESENTS TWO FACES ONE AN HELLENIC STATE THE OTHER A
KINGDOM OF PHILOSOPHERS
CONNECTED WITH THE LATTER OF THE TWO ASPECTS
ARE 2 THE PARADOXES OF THE REPUBLIC AS THEY HAVE BEEN TERMED BY
MORGENSTERN A THE COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY B OF FAMILIES C THE
RULE OF PHILOSOPHERS D THE ANALOGY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE STATE
WHICH LIKE SOME OTHER ANALOGIES IN THE REPUBLIC IS CARRIED TOO FAR
WE
MAY THEN PROCEED TO CONSIDER 3 THE SUBJECT OF EDUCATION AS CONCEIVED
BY PLATO BRINGING TOGETHER IN A GENERAL VIEW THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH
AND THE EDUCATION OF AFTER LIFE 4 WE MAY NOTE FURTHER SOME ESSENTIAL
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANCIENT AND MODERN POLITICS WHICH ARE SUGGESTED BY
THE REPUBLIC 5 WE MAY COMPARE THE POLITICUS AND THE LAWS 6 WE MAY
OBSERVE THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY PLATO ON HIS IMITATORS AND 7
TAKE OCCASION TO CONSIDER THE NATURE AND VALUE OF POLITICAL AND 8 OF
RELIGIOUS IDEALS
1
PLATO EXPRESSLY SAYS THAT HE IS INTENDING TO FOUND AN HELLENIC STATE
BOOK V
MANY OF HIS REGULATIONS ARE CHARACTERISTICALLY SPARTAN SUCH
AS THE PROHIBITION OF GOLD AND SILVER THE COMMON MEALS OF THE MEN THE
MILITARY TRAINING OF THE YOUTH THE GYMNASTIC EXERCISES OF THE WOMEN
THE LIFE OF SPARTA WAS THE LIFE OF A CAMP LAWS ENFORCED EVEN MORE
RIGIDLY IN TIME OF PEACE THAN IN WAR THE CITIZENS OF SPARTA LIKE
PLATO'S WERE FORBIDDEN TO TRADE THEY WERE TO BE SOLDIERS AND NOT
SHOPKEEPERS
NOWHERE ELSE IN GREECE WAS THE INDIVIDUAL SO COMPLETELY
SUBJECTED TO THE STATE THE TIME WHEN HE WAS TO MARRY THE EDUCATION OF
HIS CHILDREN THE CLOTHES WHICH HE WAS TO WEAR THE FOOD WHICH HE WAS
TO EAT WERE ALL PRESCRIBED BY LAW
SOME OF THE BEST ENACTMENTS IN THE
REPUBLIC SUCH AS THE REVERENCE TO BE PAID TO PARENTS AND ELDERS
AND SOME OF THE WORST SUCH AS THE EXPOSURE OF DEFORMED CHILDREN ARE
BORROWED FROM THE PRACTICE OF SPARTA
THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF FRIENDSHIPS
BETWEEN MEN AND YOUTHS OR OF MEN WITH ONE ANOTHER AS AFFORDING
INCENTIVES TO BRAVERY IS ALSO SPARTAN IN SPARTA TOO A NEARER APPROACH
WAS MADE THAN IN ANY OTHER GREEK STATE TO EQUALITY OF THE SEXES AND
TO COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY AND WHILE THERE WAS PROBABLY LESS OF
LICENTIOUSNESS IN THE SENSE OF IMMORALITY THE TIE OF MARRIAGE WAS
REGARDED MORE LIGHTLY THAN IN THE REST OF GREECE
THE 'SUPREMA LEX'
WAS THE PRESERVATION OF THE FAMILY AND THE INTEREST OF THE STATE
THE
COARSE STRENGTH OF A MILITARY GOVERNMENT WAS NOT FAVOURABLE TO PURITY
AND REFINEMENT AND THE EXCESSIVE STRICTNESS OF SOME REGULATIONS SEEMS
TO HAVE PRODUCED A REACTION
OF ALL HELLENES THE SPARTANS WERE MOST
ACCESSIBLE TO BRIBERY SEVERAL OF THE GREATEST OF THEM MIGHT BE
DESCRIBED IN THE WORDS OF PLATO AS HAVING A 'FIERCE SECRET LONGING
AFTER GOLD AND SILVER THOUGH NOT IN THE STRICT SENSE COMMUNISTS THE
PRINCIPLE OF COMMUNISM WAS MAINTAINED AMONG THEM IN THEIR DIVISION OF
LANDS IN THEIR COMMON MEALS IN THEIR SLAVES AND IN THE FREE USE OF
ONE ANOTHER'S GOODS
MARRIAGE WAS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION AND THE WOMEN
WERE EDUCATED BY THE STATE AND SANG AND DANCED IN PUBLIC WITH THE MEN
MANY TRADITIONS WERE PRESERVED AT SPARTA OF THE SEVERITY WITH WHICH THE
MAGISTRATES HAD MAINTAINED THE PRIMITIVE RULE OF MUSIC AND POETRY AS IN
THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO THE NEW FANGLED POET WAS TO BE EXPELLED
HYMNS
TO THE GODS WHICH ARE THE ONLY KIND OF MUSIC ADMITTED INTO THE IDEAL
STATE WERE THE ONLY KIND WHICH WAS PERMITTED AT SPARTA
THE SPARTANS
THOUGH AN UNPOETICAL RACE WERE NEVERTHELESS LOVERS OF POETRY THEY HAD
BEEN STIRRED BY THE ELEGIAC STRAINS OF TYRTAEUS THEY HAD CROWDED AROUND
HIPPIAS TO HEAR HIS RECITALS OF HOMER BUT IN THIS THEY RESEMBLED THE
CITIZENS OF THE TIMOCRATIC RATHER THAN OF THE IDEAL STATE
THE COUNCIL
OF ELDER MEN ALSO CORRESPONDS TO THE SPARTAN GEROUSIA AND THE FREEDOM
WITH WHICH THEY ARE PERMITTED TO JUDGE ABOUT MATTERS OF DETAIL AGREES
WITH WHAT WE ARE TOLD OF THAT INSTITUTION
ONCE MORE THE MILITARY RULE
OF NOT SPOILING THE DEAD OR OFFERING ARMS AT THE TEMPLES THE MODERATION
IN THE PURSUIT OF ENEMIES THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED TO THE PHYSICAL
WELL BEING OF THE CITIZENS THE USE OF WARFARE FOR THE SAKE OF DEFENCE
RATHER THAN OF AGGRESSION ARE FEATURES PROBABLY SUGGESTED BY THE SPIRIT
AND PRACTICE OF SPARTA
TO THE SPARTAN TYPE THE IDEAL STATE REVERTS IN THE FIRST DECLINE AND
THE CHARACTER OF THE INDIVIDUAL TIMOCRAT IS BORROWED FROM THE SPARTAN
CITIZEN
THE LOVE OF LACEDAEMON NOT ONLY AFFECTED PLATO AND XENOPHON
BUT WAS SHARED BY MANY UNDISTINGUISHED ATHENIANS THERE THEY SEEMED TO
FIND A PRINCIPLE WHICH WAS WANTING IN THEIR OWN DEMOCRACY
THE GREEK
OF THE SPARTANS ATTRACTED THEM THAT IS TO SAY NOT THE GOODNESS
OF THEIR LAWS BUT THE SPIRIT OF ORDER AND LOYALTY WHICH PREVAILED
FASCINATED BY THE IDEA CITIZENS OF ATHENS WOULD IMITATE THE
LACEDAEMONIANS IN THEIR DRESS AND MANNERS THEY WERE KNOWN TO THE
CONTEMPORARIES OF PLATO AS 'THE PERSONS WHO HAD THEIR EARS BRUISED
LIKE THE ROUNDHEADS OF THE COMMONWEALTH
THE LOVE OF ANOTHER CHURCH
OR COUNTRY WHEN SEEN AT A DISTANCE ONLY THE LONGING FOR AN IMAGINARY
SIMPLICITY IN CIVILIZED TIMES THE FOND DESIRE OF A PAST WHICH NEVER HAS
BEEN OR OF A FUTURE WHICH NEVER WILL BE THESE ARE ASPIRATIONS OF THE
HUMAN MIND WHICH ARE OFTEN FELT AMONG OURSELVES
SUCH FEELINGS MEET WITH
A RESPONSE IN THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO
BUT THERE ARE OTHER FEATURES OF THE PLATONIC REPUBLIC AS FOR EXAMPLE
THE LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL EDUCATION AND THE GRACE AND BEAUTY
OF LIFE WHICH ARE THE REVERSE OF SPARTAN
PLATO WISHES TO GIVE HIS
CITIZENS A TASTE OF ATHENIAN FREEDOM AS WELL AS OF LACEDAEMONIAN
DISCIPLINE
HIS INDIVIDUAL GENIUS IS PURELY ATHENIAN ALTHOUGH IN THEORY
HE IS A LOVER OF SPARTA AND HE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN EITHER HE HAS
ALSO A TRUE HELLENIC FEELING
HE IS DESIROUS OF HUMANIZING THE WARS OF
HELLENES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE DELPHIAN GOD IS
THE GRAND HEREDITARY INTERPRETER OF ALL HELLAS
THE SPIRIT OF HARMONY
AND THE DORIAN MODE ARE TO PREVAIL AND THE WHOLE STATE IS TO HAVE AN
EXTERNAL BEAUTY WHICH IS THE REFLEX OF THE HARMONY WITHIN
BUT HE
HAS NOT YET FOUND OUT THE TRUTH WHICH HE AFTERWARDS ENUNCIATED IN THE
LAWS THAT HE WAS A BETTER LEGISLATOR WHO MADE MEN TO BE OF ONE MIND
THAN HE WHO TRAINED THEM FOR WAR
THE CITIZENS AS IN OTHER HELLENIC
STATES DEMOCRATIC AS WELL AS ARISTOCRATIC ARE REALLY AN UPPER CLASS
FOR ALTHOUGH NO MENTION IS MADE OF SLAVES THE LOWER CLASSES ARE
ALLOWED TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE AND ARE REPRESENTED IN THE
INDIVIDUAL BY THE PASSIONS
PLATO HAS NO IDEA EITHER OF A SOCIAL STATE
IN WHICH ALL CLASSES ARE HARMONIZED OR OF A FEDERATION OF HELLAS OR
THE WORLD IN WHICH DIFFERENT NATIONS OR STATES HAVE A PLACE
HIS CITY
IS EQUIPPED FOR WAR RATHER THAN FOR PEACE AND THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE
JUSTIFIED BY THE ORDINARY CONDITION OF HELLENIC STATES
THE MYTH OF THE
EARTH BORN MEN IS AN EMBODIMENT OF THE ORTHODOX TRADITION OF HELLAS
AND THE ALLUSION TO THE FOUR AGES OF THE WORLD IS ALSO SANCTIONED BY
THE AUTHORITY OF HESIOD AND THE POETS
THUS WE SEE THAT THE REPUBLIC IS
PARTLY FOUNDED ON THE IDEAL OF THE OLD GREEK POLIS PARTLY ON THE ACTUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HELLAS IN THAT AGE
PLATO LIKE THE OLD PAINTERS
RETAINS THE TRADITIONAL FORM AND LIKE THEM HE HAS ALSO A VISION OF A
CITY IN THE CLOUDS
THERE IS YET ANOTHER THREAD WHICH IS INTERWOVEN IN THE TEXTURE OF THE
WORK FOR THE REPUBLIC IS NOT ONLY A DORIAN STATE BUT A PYTHAGOREAN
LEAGUE
THE 'WAY OF LIFE' WHICH WAS CONNECTED WITH THE NAME OF
PYTHAGORAS LIKE THE CATHOLIC MONASTIC ORDERS SHOWED THE POWER WHICH
THE MIND OF AN INDIVIDUAL MIGHT EXERCISE OVER HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND
MAY HAVE NATURALLY SUGGESTED TO PLATO THE POSSIBILITY OF REVIVING SUCH
'MEDIAEVAL INSTITUTIONS THE PYTHAGOREANS LIKE PLATO ENFORCED A RULE
OF LIFE AND A MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL TRAINING
THE INFLUENCE ASCRIBED TO
MUSIC WHICH TO US SEEMS EXAGGERATED IS ALSO A PYTHAGOREAN FEATURE IT
IS NOT TO BE REGARDED AS REPRESENTING THE REAL INFLUENCE OF MUSIC IN
THE GREEK WORLD
MORE NEARLY THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT OF HELLAS THE
PYTHAGOREAN LEAGUE OF THREE HUNDRED WAS AN ARISTOCRACY OF VIRTUE
FOR
ONCE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND THE PHILOSOPHY OF ORDER OR GREEK
EXPRESSING AND CONSEQUENTLY ENLISTING ON ITS SIDE THE COMBINED
ENDEAVOURS OF THE BETTER PART OF THE PEOPLE OBTAINED THE MANAGEMENT OF
PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND HELD POSSESSION OF IT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME UNTIL
ABOUT B C
500
PROBABLY ONLY IN STATES PREPARED BY DORIAN INSTITUTIONS
WOULD SUCH A LEAGUE HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
THE RULERS LIKE PLATO'S
GREEK WERE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO A SEVERE TRAINING IN ORDER TO
PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
LONG AFTER THE DISSOLUTION OF THE ORDER EMINENT PYTHAGOREANS SUCH AS
ARCHYTAS OF TARENTUM RETAINED THEIR POLITICAL INFLUENCE OVER THE CITIES
OF MAGNA GRAECIA
THERE WAS MUCH HERE THAT WAS SUGGESTIVE TO THE KINDRED
SPIRIT OF PLATO WHO HAD DOUBTLESS MEDITATED DEEPLY ON THE 'WAY OF LIFE
OF PYTHAGORAS' REP AND HIS FOLLOWERS
SLIGHT TRACES OF PYTHAGOREANISM
ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE MYSTICAL NUMBER OF THE STATE IN THE NUMBER WHICH
EXPRESSES THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE KING AND THE TYRANT IN THE DOCTRINE
OF TRANSMIGRATION IN THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES AS WELL AS IN THE GREAT
THOUGH SECONDARY IMPORTANCE ASCRIBED TO MATHEMATICS IN EDUCATION
BUT AS IN HIS PHILOSOPHY SO ALSO IN THE FORM OF HIS STATE HE GOES FAR
BEYOND THE OLD PYTHAGOREANS
HE ATTEMPTS A TASK REALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHICH
IS TO UNITE THE PAST OF GREEK HISTORY WITH THE FUTURE OF PHILOSOPHY
ANALOGOUS TO THAT OTHER IMPOSSIBILITY WHICH HAS OFTEN BEEN THE DREAM
OF CHRISTENDOM THE ATTEMPT TO UNITE THE PAST HISTORY OF EUROPE WITH
THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST
NOTHING ACTUALLY EXISTING IN THE WORLD AT ALL
RESEMBLES PLATO'S IDEAL STATE NOR DOES HE HIMSELF IMAGINE THAT SUCH
A STATE IS POSSIBLE
THIS HE REPEATS AGAIN AND AGAIN E G
IN THE
REPUBLIC OR IN THE LAWS WHERE CASTING A GLANCE BACK ON THE REPUBLIC
HE ADMITS THAT THE PERFECT STATE OF COMMUNISM AND PHILOSOPHY WAS
IMPOSSIBLE IN HIS OWN AGE THOUGH STILL TO BE RETAINED AS A PATTERN
THE SAME DOUBT IS IMPLIED IN THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH HE ARGUES IN THE
REPUBLIC THAT IDEALS ARE NONE THE WORSE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE REALIZED
IN FACT AND IN THE CHORUS OF LAUGHTER WHICH LIKE A BREAKING WAVE WILL
AS HE ANTICIPATES GREET THE MENTION OF HIS PROPOSALS THOUGH LIKE
OTHER WRITERS OF FICTION HE USES ALL HIS ART TO GIVE REALITY TO HIS
INVENTIONS
WHEN ASKED HOW THE IDEAL POLITY CAN COME INTO BEING HE
ANSWERS IRONICALLY 'WHEN ONE SON OF A KING BECOMES A PHILOSOPHER' HE
DESIGNATES THE FICTION OF THE EARTH BORN MEN AS 'A NOBLE LIE' AND WHEN
THE STRUCTURE IS FINALLY COMPLETE HE FAIRLY TELLS YOU THAT HIS REPUBLIC
IS A VISION ONLY WHICH IN SOME SENSE MAY HAVE REALITY BUT NOT IN THE
VULGAR ONE OF A REIGN OF PHILOSOPHERS UPON EARTH
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT
PLATO FLIES AS WELL AS WALKS BUT THIS FALLS SHORT OF THE TRUTH FOR HE
FLIES AND WALKS AT THE SAME TIME AND IS IN THE AIR AND ON FIRM GROUND
IN SUCCESSIVE INSTANTS
NIEBUHR HAS ASKED A TRIFLING QUESTION WHICH MAY BE BRIEFLY NOTICED IN
THIS PLACE WAS PLATO A GOOD CITIZEN IF BY THIS IS MEANT WAS HE LOYAL
TO ATHENIAN INSTITUTIONS HE CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO BE THE FRIEND OF
DEMOCRACY BUT NEITHER IS HE THE FRIEND OF ANY OTHER EXISTING FORM OF
GOVERNMENT ALL OF THEM HE REGARDED AS 'STATES OF FACTION' LAWS NONE
ATTAINED TO HIS IDEAL OF A VOLUNTARY RULE OVER VOLUNTARY SUBJECTS WHICH
SEEMS INDEED MORE NEARLY TO DESCRIBE DEMOCRACY THAN ANY OTHER AND THE
WORST OF THEM IS TYRANNY
THE TRUTH IS THAT THE QUESTION HAS HARDLY ANY
MEANING WHEN APPLIED TO A GREAT PHILOSOPHER WHOSE WRITINGS ARE NOT MEANT
FOR A PARTICULAR AGE AND COUNTRY BUT FOR ALL TIME AND ALL MANKIND
THE
DECLINE OF ATHENIAN POLITICS WAS PROBABLY THE MOTIVE WHICH LED PLATO TO
FRAME AN IDEAL STATE AND THE REPUBLIC MAY BE REGARDED AS REFLECTING THE
DEPARTING GLORY OF HELLAS
AS WELL MIGHT WE COMPLAIN OF ST
AUGUSTINE
WHOSE GREAT WORK 'THE CITY OF GOD' ORIGINATED IN A SIMILAR MOTIVE FOR
NOT BEING LOYAL TO THE ROMAN EMPIRE
EVEN A NEARER PARALLEL MIGHT BE
AFFORDED BY THE FIRST CHRISTIANS WHO CANNOT FAIRLY BE CHARGED WITH
BEING BAD CITIZENS BECAUSE THOUGH 'SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER POWERS THEY
WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO A CITY WHICH IS IN HEAVEN
2
THE IDEA OF THE PERFECT STATE IS FULL OF PARADOX WHEN JUDGED OF
ACCORDING TO THE ORDINARY NOTIONS OF MANKIND
THE PARADOXES OF ONE AGE
HAVE BEEN SAID TO BECOME THE COMMONPLACES OF THE NEXT BUT THE
PARADOXES OF PLATO ARE AT LEAST AS PARADOXICAL TO US AS THEY WERE TO HIS
CONTEMPORARIES
THE MODERN WORLD HAS EITHER SNEERED AT THEM AS ABSURD
OR DENOUNCED THEM AS UNNATURAL AND IMMORAL MEN HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO
FIND IN ARISTOTLE'S CRITICISMS OF THEM THE ANTICIPATION OF THEIR OWN
GOOD SENSE
THE WEALTHY AND CULTIVATED CLASSES HAVE DISLIKED AND ALSO
DREADED THEM THEY HAVE POINTED WITH SATISFACTION TO THE FAILURE OF
EFFORTS TO REALIZE THEM IN PRACTICE
YET SINCE THEY ARE THE THOUGHTS OF
ONE OF THE GREATEST OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCES AND OF ONE WHO HAD DONE
MOST TO ELEVATE MORALITY AND RELIGION THEY SEEM TO DESERVE A BETTER
TREATMENT AT OUR HANDS
WE MAY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC AS PLATO DOES
POETRY AND ASSURE THEM THAT WE MEAN NO HARM TO EXISTING INSTITUTIONS
THERE ARE SERIOUS ERRORS WHICH HAVE A SIDE OF TRUTH AND WHICH THEREFORE
MAY FAIRLY DEMAND A CAREFUL CONSIDERATION THERE ARE TRUTHS MIXED WITH
ERROR OF WHICH WE MAY INDEED SAY 'THE HALF IS BETTER THAN THE WHOLE
YET 'THE HALF' MAY BE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF HUMAN
NATURE
A THE FIRST PARADOX IS THE COMMUNITY OF GOODS WHICH IS MENTIONED
SLIGHTLY AT THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK AND SEEMINGLY AS ARISTOTLE
OBSERVES IS CONFINED TO THE GUARDIANS AT LEAST NO MENTION IS MADE OF
THE OTHER CLASSES
BUT THE OMISSION IS NOT OF ANY REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND
PROBABLY ARISES OUT OF THE PLAN OF THE WORK WHICH PREVENTS THE WRITER
FROM ENTERING INTO DETAILS
ARISTOTLE CENSURES THE COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY MUCH IN THE SPIRIT OF
MODERN POLITICAL ECONOMY AS TENDING TO REPRESS INDUSTRY AND AS DOING
AWAY WITH THE SPIRIT OF BENEVOLENCE
MODERN WRITERS ALMOST REFUSE TO
CONSIDER THE SUBJECT WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN LONG AGO SETTLED
BY THE COMMON OPINION OF MANKIND
BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE
SACREDNESS OF PROPERTY IS A NOTION FAR MORE FIXED IN MODERN THAN
IN ANCIENT TIMES
THE WORLD HAS GROWN OLDER AND IS THEREFORE MORE
CONSERVATIVE
PRIMITIVE SOCIETY OFFERED MANY EXAMPLES OF LAND HELD IN
COMMON EITHER BY A TRIBE OR BY A TOWNSHIP AND SUCH MAY PROBABLY
HAVE BEEN THE ORIGINAL FORM OF LANDED TENURE
ANCIENT LEGISLATORS HAD
INVENTED VARIOUS MODES OF DIVIDING AND PRESERVING THE DIVISIONS OF LAND
AMONG THE CITIZENS ACCORDING TO ARISTOTLE THERE WERE NATIONS WHO HELD
THE LAND IN COMMON AND DIVIDED THE PRODUCE AND THERE WERE OTHERS WHO
DIVIDED THE LAND AND STORED THE PRODUCE IN COMMON
THE EVILS OF DEBT AND
THE INEQUALITY OF PROPERTY WERE FAR GREATER IN ANCIENT THAN IN MODERN
TIMES AND THE ACCIDENTS TO WHICH PROPERTY WAS SUBJECT FROM WAR OR
REVOLUTION OR TAXATION OR OTHER LEGISLATIVE INTERFERENCE WERE ALSO
GREATER
ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES GAVE PROPERTY A LESS FIXED AND SACRED
CHARACTER
THE EARLY CHRISTIANS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE HELD THEIR PROPERTY
IN COMMON AND THE PRINCIPLE IS SANCTIONED BY THE WORDS OF CHRIST
HIMSELF AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED AS A COUNSEL OF PERFECTION IN ALMOST
ALL AGES OF THE CHURCH
NOR HAVE THERE BEEN WANTING INSTANCES OF MODERN
ENTHUSIASTS WHO HAVE MADE A RELIGION OF COMMUNISM IN EVERY AGE OF
RELIGIOUS EXCITEMENT NOTIONS LIKE WYCLIFFE'S 'INHERITANCE OF GRACE'
HAVE TENDED TO PREVAIL
A LIKE SPIRIT BUT FIERCER AND MORE VIOLENT
HAS APPEARED IN POLITICS
'THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE' SOON
BECOMES THE RED FLAG OF REPUBLICANISM
WE CAN HARDLY JUDGE WHAT EFFECT PLATO'S VIEWS WOULD HAVE UPON HIS
OWN CONTEMPORARIES THEY WOULD PERHAPS HAVE SEEMED TO THEM ONLY AN
EXAGGERATION OF THE SPARTAN COMMONWEALTH
EVEN MODERN WRITERS WOULD
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IS BASED ON EXPEDIENCY
AND MAY BE INTERFERED WITH IN A VARIETY OF WAYS FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD
ANY
OTHER MODE OF VESTING PROPERTY WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS
WOULD IN TIME ACQUIRE THE SAME BASIS OF RIGHT 'THE MOST USEFUL IN
PLATO'S WORDS 'WOULD BE THE MOST SACRED THE LAWYERS AND ECCLESIASTICS
OF FORMER AGES WOULD HAVE SPOKEN OF PROPERTY AS A SACRED INSTITUTION
BUT THEY ONLY MEANT BY SUCH LANGUAGE TO OPPOSE THE GREATEST AMOUNT
OF RESISTANCE TO ANY INVASION OF THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND OF THE
CHURCH
WHEN WE CONSIDER THE QUESTION WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF IMMEDIATE APPLICATION
TO PRACTICE IN THE SPIRIT OF PLATO'S REPUBLIC ARE WE QUITE SURE THAT
THE RECEIVED NOTIONS OF PROPERTY ARE THE BEST IS THE DISTRIBUTION OF
WEALTH WHICH IS CUSTOMARY IN CIVILIZED COUNTRIES THE MOST FAVOURABLE
THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED FOR THE EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASS
OF MANKIND CAN 'THE SPECTATOR OF ALL TIME AND ALL EXISTENCE' BE QUITE
CONVINCED THAT ONE OR TWO THOUSAND YEARS HENCE GREAT CHANGES WILL NOT
HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OR EVEN THAT THE VERY NOTION
OF PROPERTY BEYOND WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR PERSONAL MAINTENANCE MAY NOT
HAVE DISAPPEARED THIS WAS A DISTINCTION FAMILIAR TO ARISTOTLE THOUGH
LIKELY TO BE LAUGHED AT AMONG OURSELVES
SUCH A CHANGE WOULD NOT BE
GREATER THAN SOME OTHER CHANGES THROUGH WHICH THE WORLD HAS PASSED
IN THE TRANSITION FROM ANCIENT TO MODERN SOCIETY FOR EXAMPLE THE
EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS IN RUSSIA OR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN
AMERICA AND THE WEST INDIES AND NOT SO GREAT AS THE DIFFERENCE WHICH
SEPARATES THE EASTERN VILLAGE COMMUNITY FROM THE WESTERN WORLD
TO
ACCOMPLISH SUCH A REVOLUTION IN THE COURSE OF A FEW CENTURIES WOULD
IMPLY A RATE OF PROGRESS NOT MORE RAPID THAN HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE
DURING THE LAST FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS
THE KINGDOM OF JAPAN UNDERWENT
MORE CHANGE IN FIVE OR SIX YEARS THAN EUROPE IN FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED
MANY OPINIONS AND BELIEFS WHICH HAVE BEEN CHERISHED AMONG OURSELVES
QUITE AS STRONGLY AS THE SACREDNESS OF PROPERTY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND
THE MOST UNTENABLE PROPOSITIONS RESPECTING THE RIGHT OF BEQUESTS OR
ENTAIL HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED WITH AS MUCH FERVOUR AS THE MOST MODERATE
SOME ONE WILL BE HEARD TO ASK WHETHER A STATE OF SOCIETY CAN BE FINAL IN
WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THOUSANDS ARE PERILLED ON THE LIFE OR CHARACTER
OF A SINGLE PERSON
AND MANY WILL INDULGE THE HOPE THAT OUR PRESENT
CONDITION MAY AFTER ALL BE ONLY TRANSITIONAL AND MAY CONDUCT TO A
HIGHER IN WHICH PROPERTY BESIDES MINISTERING TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THE
FEW MAY ALSO FURNISH THE MEANS OF THE HIGHEST CULTURE TO ALL AND WILL
BE A GREATER BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC GENERALLY AND ALSO MORE UNDER THE
CONTROL OF PUBLIC AUTHORITY
THERE MAY COME A TIME WHEN THE SAYING
'HAVE I NOT A RIGHT TO DO WHAT I WILL WITH MY OWN WILL APPEAR TO BE A
BARBAROUS RELIC OF INDIVIDUALISM WHEN THE POSSESSION OF A PART MAY BE
A GREATER BLESSING TO EACH AND ALL THAN THE POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE IS
NOW TO ANY ONE
SUCH REFLECTIONS APPEAR VISIONARY TO THE EYE OF THE PRACTICAL STATESMAN
BUT THEY ARE WITHIN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITY TO THE PHILOSOPHER
HE CAN
IMAGINE THAT IN SOME DISTANT AGE OR CLIME AND THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF
SOME INDIVIDUAL THE NOTION OF COMMON PROPERTY MAY OR MIGHT HAVE SUNK
AS DEEP INTO THE HEART OF A RACE AND HAVE BECOME AS FIXED TO THEM AS
PRIVATE PROPERTY IS TO OURSELVES
HE KNOWS THAT THIS LATTER INSTITUTION
IS NOT MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND YEARS OLD MAY NOT THE END REVERT
TO THE BEGINNING IN OUR OWN AGE EVEN UTOPIAS AFFECT THE SPIRIT OF
LEGISLATION AND AN ABSTRACT IDEA MAY EXERCISE A GREAT INFLUENCE ON
PRACTICAL POLITICS
THE OBJECTIONS THAT WOULD BE GENERALLY URGED AGAINST PLATO'S COMMUNITY
OF PROPERTY ARE THE OLD ONES OF ARISTOTLE THAT MOTIVES FOR EXERTION
WOULD BE TAKEN AWAY AND THAT DISPUTES WOULD ARISE WHEN EACH WAS
DEPENDENT UPON ALL
EVERY MAN WOULD PRODUCE AS LITTLE AND CONSUME AS
MUCH AS HE LIKED
THE EXPERIENCE OF CIVILIZED NATIONS HAS HITHERTO BEEN
ADVERSE TO SOCIALISM
THE EFFORT IS TOO GREAT FOR HUMAN NATURE MEN TRY
TO LIVE IN COMMON BUT THE PERSONAL FEELING IS ALWAYS BREAKING IN
ON
THE OTHER HAND IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER OUR PRESENT NOTIONS OF PROPERTY
ARE NOT CONVENTIONAL FOR THEY DIFFER IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND IN
DIFFERENT STATES OF SOCIETY
WE BOAST OF AN INDIVIDUALISM WHICH IS NOT
FREEDOM BUT RATHER AN ARTIFICIAL RESULT OF THE INDUSTRIAL STATE
OF MODERN EUROPE
THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOMINALLY FREE BUT HE IS ALSO
POWERLESS IN A WORLD BOUND HAND AND FOOT IN THE CHAINS OF ECONOMIC
NECESSITY
EVEN IF WE CANNOT EXPECT THE MASS OF MANKIND TO BECOME
DISINTERESTED AT ANY RATE WE OBSERVE IN THEM A POWER OF ORGANIZATION
WHICH FIFTY YEARS AGO WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUSPECTED
THE SAME FORCES
WHICH HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF EUROPE MAY EFFECT A
SIMILAR CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OF MANKIND
AND IF
WE SUPPOSE THE INFLUENCE OF SOME GOOD AS WELL AS NEUTRAL MOTIVES WORKING
IN THE COMMUNITY THERE WILL BE NO ABSURDITY IN EXPECTING THAT THE
MASS OF MANKIND HAVING POWER AND BECOMING ENLIGHTENED ABOUT THE HIGHER
POSSIBILITIES OF HUMAN LIFE WHEN THEY LEARN HOW MUCH MORE IS ATTAINABLE
FOR ALL THAN IS AT PRESENT THE POSSESSION OF A FAVOURED FEW MAY PURSUE
THE COMMON INTEREST WITH AN INTELLIGENCE AND PERSISTENCY WHICH MANKIND
HAVE HITHERTO NEVER SEEN
NOW THAT THE WORLD HAS ONCE BEEN SET IN MOTION AND IS NO LONGER HELD
FAST UNDER THE TYRANNY OF CUSTOM AND IGNORANCE NOW THAT CRITICISM HAS
PIERCED THE VEIL OF TRADITION AND THE PAST NO LONGER OVERPOWERS THE
PRESENT THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION MAY BE EXPECTED TO BE FAR GREATER
AND SWIFTER THAN HERETOFORE
EVEN AT OUR PRESENT RATE OF SPEED THE POINT
AT WHICH WE MAY ARRIVE IN TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS IS BEYOND THE POWER
OF IMAGINATION TO FORESEE
THERE ARE FORCES IN THE WORLD WHICH WORK NOT
IN AN ARITHMETICAL BUT IN A GEOMETRICAL RATIO OF INCREASE
EDUCATION TO USE THE EXPRESSION OF PLATO MOVES LIKE A WHEEL WITH
AN EVER MULTIPLYING RAPIDITY
NOR CAN WE SAY HOW GREAT MAY BE ITS
INFLUENCE WHEN IT BECOMES UNIVERSAL WHEN IT HAS BEEN INHERITED BY
MANY GENERATIONS WHEN IT IS FREED FROM THE TRAMMELS OF SUPERSTITION
AND RIGHTLY ADAPTED TO THE WANTS AND CAPACITIES OF DIFFERENT CLASSES
OF MEN AND WOMEN
NEITHER DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH MORE THE CO OPERATION OF
MINDS OR OF HANDS MAY BE CAPABLE OF ACCOMPLISHING WHETHER IN LABOUR OR
IN STUDY
THE RESOURCES OF THE NATURAL SCIENCES ARE NOT HALF DEVELOPED
AS YET THE SOIL OF THE EARTH INSTEAD OF GROWING MORE BARREN MAY
BECOME MANY TIMES MORE FERTILE THAN HITHERTO THE USES OF MACHINERY FAR
GREATER AND ALSO MORE MINUTE THAN AT PRESENT
NEW SECRETS OF PHYSIOLOGY
MAY BE REVEALED DEEPLY AFFECTING HUMAN NATURE IN ITS INNERMOST
RECESSES
THE STANDARD OF HEALTH MAY BE RAISED AND THE LIVES OF MEN
PROLONGED BY SANITARY AND MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
THERE MAY BE PEACE THERE
MAY BE LEISURE THERE MAY BE INNOCENT REFRESHMENTS OF MANY KINDS
THE
EVER INCREASING POWER OF LOCOMOTION MAY JOIN THE EXTREMES OF EARTH
THERE MAY BE MYSTERIOUS WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN MIND SUCH AS OCCUR ONLY
AT GREAT CRISES OF HISTORY
THE EAST AND THE WEST MAY MEET TOGETHER AND
ALL NATIONS MAY CONTRIBUTE THEIR THOUGHTS AND THEIR EXPERIENCE TO THE
COMMON STOCK OF HUMANITY
MANY OTHER ELEMENTS ENTER INTO A SPECULATION
OF THIS KIND
BUT IT IS BETTER TO MAKE AN END OF THEM
FOR SUCH
REFLECTIONS APPEAR TO THE MAJORITY FAR FETCHED AND TO MEN OF SCIENCE
COMMONPLACE
B NEITHER TO THE MIND OF PLATO NOR OF ARISTOTLE DID THE DOCTRINE OF
COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY PRESENT AT ALL THE SAME DIFFICULTY OR APPEAR TO
BE THE SAME VIOLATION OF THE COMMON HELLENIC SENTIMENT AS THE COMMUNITY
OF WIVES AND CHILDREN
THIS PARADOX HE PREFACES BY ANOTHER PROPOSAL
THAT THE OCCUPATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN SHALL BE THE SAME AND THAT TO
THIS END THEY SHALL HAVE A COMMON TRAINING AND EDUCATION
MALE AND
FEMALE ANIMALS HAVE THE SAME PURSUITS WHY NOT ALSO THE TWO SEXES OF
MAN
BUT HAVE WE NOT HERE FALLEN INTO A CONTRADICTION FOR WE WERE SAYING
THAT DIFFERENT NATURES SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT PURSUITS
HOW THEN CAN MEN
AND WOMEN HAVE THE SAME AND IS NOT THE PROPOSAL INCONSISTENT WITH OUR
NOTION OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR THESE OBJECTIONS ARE NO SOONER RAISED
THAN ANSWERED FOR ACCORDING TO PLATO THERE IS NO ORGANIC DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN BUT ONLY THE ACCIDENTAL ONE THAT MEN BEGET AND
WOMEN BEAR CHILDREN
FOLLOWING THE ANALOGY OF THE OTHER ANIMALS HE
CONTENDS THAT ALL NATURAL GIFTS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT INDIFFERENTLY AMONG
BOTH SEXES THOUGH THERE MAY BE A SUPERIORITY OF DEGREE ON THE PART OF
THE MEN
THE OBJECTION ON THE SCORE OF DECENCY TO THEIR TAKING PART
IN THE SAME GYMNASTIC EXERCISES IS MET BY PLATO'S ASSERTION THAT THE
EXISTING FEELING IS A MATTER OF HABIT
THAT PLATO SHOULD HAVE EMANCIPATED HIMSELF FROM THE IDEAS OF HIS OWN
COUNTRY AND FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THE EAST SHOWS A WONDERFUL INDEPENDENCE
OF MIND
HE IS CONSCIOUS THAT WOMEN ARE HALF THE HUMAN RACE IN SOME
RESPECTS THE MORE IMPORTANT HALF LAWS AND FOR THE SAKE BOTH OF MEN
AND WOMEN HE DESIRES TO RAISE THE WOMAN TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF EXISTENCE
HE BRINGS NOT SENTIMENT BUT PHILOSOPHY TO BEAR UPON A QUESTION WHICH
BOTH IN ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES HAS BEEN CHIEFLY REGARDED IN THE LIGHT
OF CUSTOM OR FEELING
THE GREEKS HAD NOBLE CONCEPTIONS OF WOMANHOOD
IN THE GODDESSES ATHENE AND ARTEMIS AND IN THE HEROINES ANTIGONE AND
ANDROMACHE
BUT THESE IDEALS HAD NO COUNTERPART IN ACTUAL LIFE
THE
ATHENIAN WOMAN WAS IN NO WAY THE EQUAL OF HER HUSBAND SHE WAS NOT THE
ENTERTAINER OF HIS GUESTS OR THE MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE BUT ONLY HIS
HOUSEKEEPER AND THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILDREN
SHE TOOK NO PART IN MILITARY
OR POLITICAL MATTERS NOR IS THERE ANY INSTANCE IN THE LATER AGES OF
GREECE OF A WOMAN BECOMING FAMOUS IN LITERATURE
'HERS IS THE GREATEST
GLORY WHO HAS THE LEAST RENOWN AMONG MEN IS THE HISTORIAN'S CONCEPTION
OF FEMININE EXCELLENCE
A VERY DIFFERENT IDEAL OF WOMANHOOD IS HELD UP
BY PLATO TO THE WORLD SHE IS TO BE THE COMPANION OF THE MAN AND TO
SHARE WITH HIM IN THE TOILS OF WAR AND IN THE CARES OF GOVERNMENT
SHE
IS TO BE SIMILARLY TRAINED BOTH IN BODILY AND MENTAL EXERCISES
SHE
IS TO LOSE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE INCIDENTS OF MATERNITY AND THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FEMALE SEX
THE MODERN ANTAGONIST OF THE EQUALITY OF THE SEXES WOULD ARGUE THAT THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ARE NOT CONFINED TO THE SINGLE POINT
URGED BY PLATO THAT SENSIBILITY GENTLENESS GRACE ARE THE QUALITIES
OF WOMEN WHILE ENERGY STRENGTH HIGHER INTELLIGENCE ARE TO BE LOOKED
FOR IN MEN
AND THE CRITICISM IS JUST THE DIFFERENCES AFFECT THE WHOLE
NATURE AND ARE NOT AS PLATO SUPPOSES CONFINED TO A SINGLE POINT
BUT
NEITHER CAN WE SAY HOW FAR THESE DIFFERENCES ARE DUE TO EDUCATION AND
THE OPINIONS OF MANKIND OR PHYSICALLY INHERITED FROM THE HABITS AND
OPINIONS OF FORMER GENERATIONS
WOMEN HAVE BEEN ALWAYS TAUGHT NOT
EXACTLY THAT THEY ARE SLAVES BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN INFERIOR POSITION
WHICH IS ALSO SUPPOSED TO HAVE COMPENSATING ADVANTAGES AND TO THIS
POSITION THEY HAVE CONFORMED
IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE PHYSICAL FORM MAY
EASILY CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF GENERATIONS THROUGH THE MODE OF LIFE AND
THE WEAKNESS OR DELICACY WHICH WAS ONCE A MATTER OF OPINION MAY BECOME
A PHYSICAL FACT
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SEX VARY GREATLY IN DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES AND RANKS OF SOCIETY AND AT DIFFERENT AGES IN THE SAME
INDIVIDUALS
PLATO MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN DENYING THAT THERE WAS ANY
ULTIMATE DIFFERENCE IN THE SEXES OF MAN OTHER THAN THAT WHICH EXISTS IN
ANIMALS BECAUSE ALL OTHER DIFFERENCES MAY BE CONCEIVED TO DISAPPEAR IN
OTHER STATES OF SOCIETY OR UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF LIFE AND
TRAINING
THE FIRST WAVE HAVING BEEN PASSED WE PROCEED TO THE SECOND COMMUNITY
OF WIVES AND CHILDREN
'IS IT POSSIBLE IS IT DESIRABLE FOR AS GLAUCON
INTIMATES AND AS WE FAR MORE STRONGLY INSIST 'GREAT DOUBTS MAY
BE ENTERTAINED ABOUT BOTH THESE POINTS ANY FREE DISCUSSION OF THE
QUESTION IS IMPOSSIBLE AND MANKIND ARE PERHAPS RIGHT IN NOT ALLOWING
THE ULTIMATE BASES OF SOCIAL LIFE TO BE EXAMINED
FEW OF US CAN SAFELY
ENQUIRE INTO THE THINGS WHICH NATURE HIDES ANY MORE THAN WE CAN
DISSECT OUR OWN BODIES
STILL THE MANNER IN WHICH PLATO ARRIVED AT HIS
CONCLUSIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
FOR HERE AS MR
GROTE HAS REMARKED
IS A WONDERFUL THING THAT ONE OF THE WISEST AND BEST OF MEN SHOULD HAVE
ENTERTAINED IDEAS OF MORALITY WHICH ARE WHOLLY AT VARIANCE WITH OUR
OWN
AND IF WE WOULD DO PLATO JUSTICE WE MUST EXAMINE CAREFULLY THE
CHARACTER OF HIS PROPOSALS
FIRST WE MAY OBSERVE THAT THE RELATIONS OF
THE SEXES SUPPOSED BY HIM ARE THE REVERSE OF LICENTIOUS HE SEEMS RATHER
TO AIM AT AN IMPOSSIBLE STRICTNESS
SECONDLY HE CONCEIVES THE FAMILY
TO BE THE NATURAL ENEMY OF THE STATE AND HE ENTERTAINS THE SERIOUS
HOPE THAT AN UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD MAY TAKE THE PLACE OF PRIVATE
INTERESTS AN ASPIRATION WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT JUSTIFIED BY EXPERIENCE
HAS POSSESSED MANY NOBLE MINDS
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO SENTIMENT
OR IMAGINATION IN THE CONNECTIONS WHICH MEN AND WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED BY
HIM TO FORM HUMAN BEINGS RETURN TO THE LEVEL OF THE ANIMALS NEITHER
EXALTING TO HEAVEN NOR YET ABUSING THE NATURAL INSTINCTS
ALL THAT
WORLD OF POETRY AND FANCY WHICH THE PASSION OF LOVE HAS CALLED FORTH
IN MODERN LITERATURE AND ROMANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN BANISHED BY PLATO
THE
ARRANGEMENTS OF MARRIAGE IN THE REPUBLIC ARE DIRECTED TO ONE OBJECT THE
IMPROVEMENT OF THE RACE
IN SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS A GREAT DEVELOPMENT
BOTH OF BODILY AND MENTAL QUALITIES MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
THE ANALOGY OF
ANIMALS TENDS TO SHOW THAT MANKIND CAN WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS RECEIVE A
CHANGE OF NATURE
AND AS IN ANIMALS WE SHOULD COMMONLY CHOOSE THE BEST
FOR BREEDING AND DESTROY THE OTHERS SO THERE MUST BE A SELECTION MADE
OF THE HUMAN BEINGS WHOSE LIVES ARE WORTHY TO BE PRESERVED
WE START BACK HORRIFIED FROM THIS PLATONIC IDEAL IN THE BELIEF FIRST
THAT THE HIGHER FEELINGS OF HUMANITY ARE FAR TOO STRONG TO BE CRUSHED
OUT SECONDLY THAT IF THE PLAN COULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION WE
SHOULD BE POORLY RECOMPENSED BY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BREED FOR THE LOSS
OF THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE
THE GREATEST REGARD FOR THE WEAKEST AND
MEANEST OF HUMAN BEINGS THE INFANT THE CRIMINAL THE INSANE THE
IDIOT TRULY SEEMS TO US ONE OF THE NOBLEST RESULTS OF CHRISTIANITY
WE
HAVE LEARNED THOUGH AS YET IMPERFECTLY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MAN HAS AN
ENDLESS VALUE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND THAT WE HONOUR HIM WHEN WE HONOUR
THE DARKENED AND DISFIGURED IMAGE OF HIM LAWS
THIS IS THE LESSON
WHICH CHRIST TAUGHT IN A PARABLE WHEN HE SAID 'THEIR ANGELS DO ALWAYS
BEHOLD THE FACE OF MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN SUCH LESSONS ARE ONLY
PARTIALLY REALIZED IN ANY AGE THEY WERE FOREIGN TO THE AGE OF PLATO AS
THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT DEGREES OF STRENGTH IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR
AGES OF THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
TO THE GREEK THE FAMILY WAS A RELIGIOUS AND
CUSTOMARY INSTITUTION BINDING THE MEMBERS TOGETHER BY A TIE INFERIOR
IN STRENGTH TO THAT OF FRIENDSHIP AND HAVING A LESS SOLEMN AND SACRED
SOUND THAN THAT OF COUNTRY
THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTED ON THE LOWER
LEVEL OF CUSTOM PLATO IMAGINED THAT HE WAS RAISING TO THE HIGHER LEVEL
OF NATURE AND REASON WHILE FROM THE MODERN AND CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW
WE REGARD HIM AS SANCTIONING MURDER AND DESTROYING THE FIRST PRINCIPLES
OF MORALITY
THE GREAT ERROR IN THESE AND SIMILAR SPECULATIONS IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN MAN AND THE ANIMALS IS FORGOTTEN IN THEM
THE HUMAN BEING
IS REGARDED WITH THE EYE OF A DOG OR BIRD FANCIER OR AT BEST OF A
SLAVE OWNER THE HIGHER OR HUMAN QUALITIES ARE LEFT OUT
THE BREEDER
OF ANIMALS AIMS CHIEFLY AT SIZE OR SPEED OR STRENGTH IN A FEW CASES AT
COURAGE OR TEMPER MOST OFTEN THE FITNESS OF THE ANIMAL FOR FOOD IS THE
GREAT DESIDERATUM
BUT MANKIND ARE NOT BRED TO BE EATEN NOR YET FOR
THEIR SUPERIORITY IN FIGHTING OR IN RUNNING OR IN DRAWING CARTS
NEITHER
DOES THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE HUMAN RACE CONSIST MERELY IN THE INCREASE
OF THE BONES AND FLESH BUT IN THE GROWTH AND ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE MIND
HENCE THERE MUST BE 'A MARRIAGE OF TRUE MINDS' AS WELL AS OF BODIES OF
IMAGINATION AND REASON AS WELL AS OF LUSTS AND INSTINCTS
MEN AND WOMEN
WITHOUT FEELING OR IMAGINATION ARE JUSTLY CALLED BRUTES YET PLATO
TAKES AWAY THESE QUALITIES AND PUTS NOTHING IN THEIR PLACE NOT EVEN
THE DESIRE OF A NOBLE OFFSPRING SINCE PARENTS ARE NOT TO KNOW THEIR OWN
CHILDREN
THE MOST IMPORTANT TRANSACTION OF SOCIAL LIFE HE WHO IS THE
IDEALIST PHILOSOPHER CONVERTS INTO THE MOST BRUTAL
FOR THE PAIR ARE TO
HAVE NO RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER EXCEPT AT THE HYMENEAL FESTIVAL THEIR
CHILDREN ARE NOT THEIRS BUT THE STATE'S NOR IS ANY TIE OF AFFECTION TO
UNITE THEM
YET HERE THE ANALOGY OF THE ANIMALS MIGHT HAVE SAVED
PLATO FROM A GIGANTIC ERROR IF HE HAD 'NOT LOST SIGHT OF HIS OWN
ILLUSTRATION FOR THE 'NOBLER SORT OF BIRDS AND BEASTS' NOURISH AND
PROTECT THEIR OFFSPRING AND ARE FAITHFUL TO ONE ANOTHER
AN EMINENT PHYSIOLOGIST THINKS IT WORTH WHILE 'TO TRY AND PLACE LIFE
ON A PHYSICAL BASIS BUT SHOULD NOT LIFE REST ON THE MORAL RATHER THAN
UPON THE PHYSICAL THE HIGHER COMES FIRST THEN THE LOWER FIRST THE
HUMAN AND RATIONAL AFTERWARDS THE ANIMAL
YET THEY ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY
DIVIDED AND IN TIMES OF SICKNESS OR MOMENTS OF SELF INDULGENCE THEY
SEEM TO BE ONLY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF A COMMON HUMAN NATURE WHICH
INCLUDES THEM BOTH
NEITHER IS THE MORAL THE LIMIT OF THE PHYSICAL
BUT THE EXPANSION AND ENLARGEMENT OF IT THE HIGHEST FORM WHICH THE
PHYSICAL IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING
AS PLATO WOULD SAY THE BODY DOES NOT
TAKE CARE OF THE BODY AND STILL LESS OF THE MIND BUT THE MIND TAKES
CARE OF BOTH
IN ALL HUMAN ACTION NOT THAT WHICH IS COMMON TO MAN AND
THE ANIMALS IS THE CHARACTERISTIC ELEMENT BUT THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES
HIM FROM THEM
EVEN IF WE ADMIT THE PHYSICAL BASIS AND RESOLVE ALL
VIRTUE INTO HEALTH OF BODY 'LA FACON QUE NOTRE SANG CIRCULE STILL ON
MERELY PHYSICAL GROUNDS WE MUST COME BACK TO IDEAS
MIND AND REASON AND
DUTY AND CONSCIENCE UNDER THESE OR OTHER NAMES ARE ALWAYS REAPPEARING
THERE CANNOT BE HEALTH OF BODY WITHOUT HEALTH OF MIND NOR HEALTH OF
MIND WITHOUT THE SENSE OF DUTY AND THE LOVE OF TRUTH CHARM
THAT THE GREATEST OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS SHOULD IN HIS REGULATIONS
ABOUT MARRIAGE HAVE FALLEN INTO THE ERROR OF SEPARATING BODY AND MIND
DOES INDEED APPEAR SURPRISING
YET THE WONDER IS NOT SO MUCH THAT PLATO
SHOULD HAVE ENTERTAINED IDEAS OF MORALITY WHICH TO OUR OWN AGE ARE
REVOLTING BUT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CONTRADICTED HIMSELF TO AN EXTENT
WHICH IS HARDLY CREDIBLE FALLING IN AN INSTANT FROM THE HEAVEN OF
IDEALISM INTO THE CRUDEST ANIMALISM
REJOICING IN THE NEWLY FOUND GIFT
OF REFLECTION HE APPEARS TO HAVE THOUGHT OUT A SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH HE
HAD BETTER HAVE FOLLOWED THE ENLIGHTENED FEELING OF HIS OWN AGE
THE
GENERAL SENTIMENT OF HELLAS WAS OPPOSED TO HIS MONSTROUS FANCY
THE OLD
POETS AND IN LATER TIME THE TRAGEDIANS SHOWED NO WANT OF RESPECT FOR
THE FAMILY ON WHICH MUCH OF THEIR RELIGION WAS BASED
BUT THE EXAMPLE
OF SPARTA AND PERHAPS IN SOME DEGREE THE TENDENCY TO DEFY PUBLIC
OPINION SEEMS TO HAVE MISLED HIM
HE WILL MAKE ONE FAMILY OUT OF ALL
THE FAMILIES OF THE STATE
HE WILL SELECT THE FINEST SPECIMENS OF MEN
AND WOMEN AND BREED FROM THESE ONLY
YET BECAUSE THE ILLUSION IS ALWAYS RETURNING FOR THE ANIMAL PART OF
HUMAN NATURE WILL FROM TIME TO TIME ASSERT ITSELF IN THE DISGUISE OF
PHILOSOPHY AS WELL AS OF POETRY AND ALSO BECAUSE ANY DEPARTURE FROM
ESTABLISHED MORALITY EVEN WHERE THIS IS NOT INTENDED IS APT TO BE
UNSETTLING IT MAY BE WORTH WHILE TO DRAW OUT A LITTLE MORE AT LENGTH
THE OBJECTIONS TO THE PLATONIC MARRIAGE
IN THE FIRST PLACE HISTORY
SHOWS THAT WHEREVER POLYGAMY HAS BEEN LARGELY ALLOWED THE RACE HAS
DETERIORATED
ONE MAN TO ONE WOMAN IS THE LAW OF GOD AND NATURE
NEARLY
ALL THE CIVILIZED PEOPLES OF THE WORLD AT SOME PERIOD BEFORE THE AGE OF
WRITTEN RECORDS HAVE BECOME MONOGAMISTS AND THE STEP WHEN ONCE TAKEN
HAS NEVER BEEN RETRACED
THE EXCEPTIONS OCCURRING AMONG BRAHMINS OR
MAHOMETANS OR THE ANCIENT PERSIANS ARE OF THAT SORT WHICH MAY BE SAID
TO PROVE THE RULE
THE CONNEXIONS FORMED BETWEEN SUPERIOR AND
INFERIOR RACES HARDLY EVER PRODUCE A NOBLE OFFSPRING BECAUSE THEY ARE
LICENTIOUS AND BECAUSE THE CHILDREN IN SUCH CASES USUALLY DESPISE THE
MOTHER AND ARE NEGLECTED BY THE FATHER WHO IS ASHAMED OF THEM
BARBAROUS NATIONS WHEN THEY ARE INTRODUCED BY EUROPEANS TO VICE DIE
OUT POLYGAMIST PEOPLES EITHER IMPORT AND ADOPT CHILDREN FROM OTHER
COUNTRIES OR DWINDLE IN NUMBERS OR BOTH
DYNASTIES AND ARISTOCRACIES
WHICH HAVE DISREGARDED THE LAWS OF NATURE HAVE DECREASED IN NUMBERS AND
DEGENERATED IN STATURE 'MARIAGES DE CONVENANCE' LEAVE THEIR ENFEEBLING
STAMP ON THE OFFSPRING OF THEM KING LEAR
THE MARRIAGE OF NEAR
RELATIONS OR THE MARRYING IN AND IN OF THE SAME FAMILY TENDS CONSTANTLY
TO WEAKNESS OR IDIOCY IN THE CHILDREN SOMETIMES ASSUMING THE FORM AS
THEY GROW OLDER OF PASSIONATE LICENTIOUSNESS
THE COMMON PROSTITUTE
RARELY HAS ANY OFFSPRING
BY SUCH UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE IS THE AUTHORITY
OF MORALITY ASSERTED IN THE RELATIONS OF THE SEXES AND SO MANY MORE
ELEMENTS ENTER INTO THIS 'MYSTERY' THAN ARE DREAMED OF BY PLATO AND SOME
OTHER PHILOSOPHERS
RECENT ENQUIRERS HAVE INDEED ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT AMONG
PRIMITIVE TRIBES THERE EXISTED A COMMUNITY OF WIVES AS OF PROPERTY AND
THAT THE CAPTIVE TAKEN BY THE SPEAR WAS THE ONLY WIFE OR SLAVE WHOM ANY
MAN WAS PERMITTED TO CALL HIS OWN
THE PARTIAL EXISTENCE OF SUCH CUSTOMS
AMONG SOME OF THE LOWER RACES OF MAN AND THE SURVIVAL OF PECULIAR
CEREMONIES IN THE MARRIAGES OF SOME CIVILIZED NATIONS ARE THOUGHT TO
FURNISH A PROOF OF SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS HAVING BEEN ONCE UNIVERSAL
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT THE STUDY OF ANTHROPOLOGY HAS CONSIDERABLY
CHANGED OUR VIEWS RESPECTING THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF MAN UPON THE EARTH
WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ABORIGINES OF THE WORLD THAN FORMERLY BUT OUR
INCREASING KNOWLEDGE SHOWS ABOVE ALL THINGS HOW LITTLE WE KNOW
WITH ALL
THE HELPS WHICH WRITTEN MONUMENTS AFFORD WE DO BUT FAINTLY REALIZE THE
CONDITION OF MAN TWO THOUSAND OR THREE THOUSAND YEARS AGO
OF WHAT HIS
CONDITION WAS WHEN REMOVED TO A DISTANCE 200 000 OR 300 000 YEARS WHEN
THE MAJORITY OF MANKIND WERE LOWER AND NEARER THE ANIMALS THAN ANY TRIBE
NOW EXISTING UPON THE EARTH WE CANNOT EVEN ENTERTAIN CONJECTURE
PLATO
LAWS AND ARISTOTLE METAPH MAY HAVE BEEN MORE RIGHT THAN WE IMAGINE
IN SUPPOSING THAT SOME FORMS OF CIVILISATION WERE DISCOVERED AND LOST
SEVERAL TIMES OVER
IF WE CANNOT ARGUE THAT ALL BARBARISM IS A DEGRADED
CIVILIZATION NEITHER CAN WE SET ANY LIMITS TO THE DEPTH OF DEGRADATION
TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE MAY SINK THROUGH WAR DISEASE OR ISOLATION
AND IF WE ARE TO DRAW INFERENCES ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE FROM
THE PRACTICE OF BARBAROUS NATIONS WE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE
REMOTER ANALOGY OF THE ANIMALS
MANY BIRDS AND ANIMALS ESPECIALLY THE
CARNIVOROUS HAVE ONLY ONE MATE AND THE LOVE AND CARE OF OFFSPRING
WHICH SEEMS TO BE NATURAL IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PRIMITIVE THEORY OF
MARRIAGE
IF WE GO BACK TO AN IMAGINARY STATE IN WHICH MEN WERE ALMOST
ANIMALS AND THE COMPANIONS OF THEM WE HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT TO ARGUE FROM
WHAT IS ANIMAL TO WHAT IS HUMAN AS FROM THE BARBAROUS TO THE CIVILIZED
MAN
THE RECORD OF ANIMAL LIFE ON THE GLOBE IS FRAGMENTARY THE
CONNECTING LINKS ARE WANTING AND CANNOT BE SUPPLIED THE RECORD OF
SOCIAL LIFE IS STILL MORE FRAGMENTARY AND PRECARIOUS
EVEN IF WE ADMIT
THAT OUR FIRST ANCESTORS HAD NO SUCH INSTITUTION AS MARRIAGE STILL
THE STAGES BY WHICH MEN PASSED FROM OUTER BARBARISM TO THE COMPARATIVE
CIVILIZATION OF CHINA ASSYRIA AND GREECE OR EVEN OF THE ANCIENT
GERMANS ARE WHOLLY UNKNOWN TO US
SUCH SPECULATIONS ARE APT TO BE UNSETTLING BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO SHOW
THAT AN INSTITUTION WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO BE A REVELATION FROM HEAVEN IS
ONLY THE GROWTH OF HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE
WE ASK WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF
MARRIAGE AND WE ARE TOLD THAT LIKE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY AFTER MANY
WARS AND CONTESTS IT HAS GRADUALLY ARISEN OUT OF THE SELFISHNESS OF
BARBARIANS
WE STAND FACE TO FACE WITH HUMAN NATURE IN ITS PRIMITIVE
NAKEDNESS
WE ARE COMPELLED TO ACCEPT NOT THE HIGHEST BUT THE LOWEST
ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF HUMAN SOCIETY
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE
MAY TRULY SAY THAT EVERY STEP IN HUMAN PROGRESS HAS BEEN IN THE SAME
DIRECTION AND THAT IN THE COURSE OF AGES THE IDEA OF MARRIAGE AND OF
THE FAMILY HAS BEEN MORE AND MORE DEFINED AND CONSECRATED
THE CIVILIZED
EAST IS IMMEASURABLY IN ADVANCE OF ANY SAVAGE TRIBES THE GREEKS AND
ROMANS HAVE IMPROVED UPON THE EAST THE CHRISTIAN NATIONS HAVE BEEN
STRICTER IN THEIR VIEWS OF THE MARRIAGE RELATION THAN ANY OF THE
ANCIENTS
IN THIS AS IN SO MANY OTHER THINGS INSTEAD OF LOOKING BACK
WITH REGRET TO THE PAST WE SHOULD LOOK FORWARD WITH HOPE TO THE FUTURE
WE MUST CONSECRATE THAT WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST HOLY AND THAT
'WHICH IS THE MOST HOLY WILL BE THE MOST USEFUL THERE IS MORE REASON
FOR MAINTAINING THE SACREDNESS OF THE MARRIAGE TIE WHEN WE SEE THE
BENEFIT OF IT THAN WHEN WE ONLY FELT A VAGUE RELIGIOUS HORROR ABOUT
THE VIOLATION OF IT
BUT IN ALL TIMES OF TRANSITION WHEN ESTABLISHED
BELIEFS ARE BEING UNDERMINED THERE IS A DANGER THAT IN THE PASSAGE FROM
THE OLD TO THE NEW WE MAY INSENSIBLY LET GO THE MORAL PRINCIPLE FINDING
AN EXCUSE FOR LISTENING TO THE VOICE OF PASSION IN THE UNCERTAINTY OF
KNOWLEDGE OR THE FLUCTUATIONS OF OPINION
AND THERE ARE MANY PERSONS
IN OUR OWN DAY WHO ENLIGHTENED BY THE STUDY OF ANTHROPOLOGY AND
FASCINATED BY WHAT IS NEW AND STRANGE SOME USING THE LANGUAGE OF FEAR
OTHERS OF HOPE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT A TIME WILL COME WHEN
THROUGH THE SELF ASSERTION OF WOMEN OR THE REBELLIOUS SPIRIT OF
CHILDREN BY THE ANALYSIS OF HUMAN RELATIONS OR BY THE FORCE OF OUTWARD
CIRCUMSTANCES THE TIES OF FAMILY LIFE MAY BE BROKEN OR GREATLY RELAXED
THEY POINT TO SOCIETIES IN AMERICA AND ELSEWHERE WHICH TEND TO SHOW THAT
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FAMILY NEED NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE THE OVERTHROW
OF ALL MORALITY
WHEREVER WE MAY THINK OF SUCH SPECULATIONS WE CAN
HARDLY DENY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MORE RIFE IN THIS GENERATION THAN IN ANY
OTHER AND WHITHER THEY ARE TENDING WHO CAN PREDICT
TO THE DOUBTS AND QUERIES RAISED BY THESE 'SOCIAL REFORMERS' RESPECTING
THE RELATION OF THE SEXES AND THE MORAL NATURE OF MAN THERE IS A
SUFFICIENT ANSWER IF ANY IS NEEDED
THE DIFFERENCE ABOUT THEM AND US IS
REALLY ONE OF FACT
THEY ARE SPEAKING OF MAN AS THEY WISH OR FANCY HIM
TO BE BUT WE ARE SPEAKING OF HIM AS HE IS
THEY ISOLATE THE ANIMAL
PART OF HIS NATURE WE REGARD HIM AS A CREATURE HAVING MANY SIDES OR
ASPECTS MOVING BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL STRIVING TO RISE ABOVE HIMSELF
AND TO BECOME 'A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS WE ALSO TO USE
A PLATONIC FORMULA ARE NOT IGNORANT OF THE DISSATISFACTIONS AND
INCOMPATIBILITIES OF FAMILY LIFE OF THE MEANNESSES OF TRADE OF THE
FLATTERIES OF ONE CLASS OF SOCIETY BY ANOTHER OF THE IMPEDIMENTS WHICH
THE FAMILY THROWS IN THE WAY OF LOFTY AIMS AND ASPIRATIONS
BUT WE ARE
CONSCIOUS THAT THERE ARE EVILS AND DANGERS IN THE BACKGROUND GREATER
STILL WHICH ARE NOT APPRECIATED BECAUSE THEY ARE EITHER CONCEALED
OR SUPPRESSED
WHAT A CONDITION OF MAN WOULD THAT BE IN WHICH HUMAN
PASSIONS WERE CONTROLLED BY NO AUTHORITY DIVINE OR HUMAN IN WHICH
THERE WAS NO SHAME OR DECENCY NO HIGHER AFFECTION OVERCOMING OR
SANCTIFYING THE NATURAL INSTINCTS BUT SIMPLY A RULE OF HEALTH IS IT
FOR THIS THAT WE ARE ASKED TO THROW AWAY THE CIVILIZATION WHICH IS THE
GROWTH OF AGES
FOR STRENGTH AND HEALTH ARE NOT THE ONLY QUALITIES TO BE DESIRED THERE
ARE THE MORE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS OF MIND AND CHARACTER AND SOUL
WE
KNOW HOW HUMAN NATURE MAY BE DEGRADED WE DO NOT KNOW HOW BY ARTIFICIAL
MEANS ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE BREED CAN BE EFFECTED
THE PROBLEM IS A
COMPLEX ONE FOR IF WE GO BACK ONLY FOUR STEPS AND THESE AT LEAST ENTER
INTO THE COMPOSITION OF A CHILD THERE ARE COMMONLY THIRTY PROGENITORS
TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT
MANY CURIOUS FACTS RARELY ADMITTING OF PROOF
ARE TOLD US RESPECTING THE INHERITANCE OF DISEASE OR CHARACTER FROM A
REMOTE ANCESTOR
WE CAN TRACE THE PHYSICAL RESEMBLANCES OF PARENTS AND
CHILDREN IN THE SAME FAMILY
'SIC OCULOS SIC ILLE MANUS SIC ORA FEREBAT'
BUT SCARCELY LESS OFTEN THE DIFFERENCES WHICH DISTINGUISH CHILDREN BOTH
FROM THEIR PARENTS AND FROM ONE ANOTHER
WE ARE TOLD OF SIMILAR MENTAL
PECULIARITIES RUNNING IN FAMILIES AND AGAIN OF A TENDENCY AS IN
THE ANIMALS TO REVERT TO A COMMON OR ORIGINAL STOCK
BUT WE HAVE A
DIFFICULTY IN DISTINGUISHING WHAT IS A TRUE INHERITANCE OF GENIUS OR
OTHER QUALITIES AND WHAT IS MERE IMITATION OR THE RESULT OF SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES
GREAT MEN AND GREAT WOMEN HAVE RARELY HAD GREAT FATHERS
AND MOTHERS
NOTHING THAT WE KNOW OF IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR BIRTH
OR LINEAGE WILL EXPLAIN THEIR APPEARANCE
OF THE ENGLISH POETS OF THE
LAST AND TWO PRECEDING CENTURIES SCARCELY A DESCENDANT REMAINS NONE
HAVE EVER BEEN DISTINGUISHED
SO DEEPLY HAS NATURE HIDDEN HER SECRET
AND SO RIDICULOUS IS THE FANCY WHICH HAS BEEN ENTERTAINED BY SOME THAT
WE MIGHT IN TIME BY SUITABLE MARRIAGE ARRANGEMENTS OR AS PLATO WOULD
HAVE SAID 'BY AN INGENIOUS SYSTEM OF LOTS PRODUCE A SHAKESPEARE OR
A MILTON
EVEN SUPPOSING THAT WE COULD BREED MEN HAVING THE TENACITY
OF BULLDOGS OR LIKE THE SPARTANS 'LACKING THE WIT TO RUN AWAY
IN BATTLE WOULD THE WORLD BE ANY THE BETTER MANY OF THE NOBLEST
SPECIMENS OF THE HUMAN RACE HAVE BEEN AMONG THE WEAKEST PHYSICALLY
TYRTAEUS OR AESOP OR OUR OWN NEWTON WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AT SPARTA
AND SOME OF THE FAIREST AND STRONGEST MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN AMONG THE
WICKEDEST AND WORST
NOT BY THE PLATONIC DEVICE OF UNITING THE STRONG
AND FAIR WITH THE STRONG AND FAIR REGARDLESS OF SENTIMENT AND MORALITY
NOR YET BY HIS OTHER DEVICE OF COMBINING DISSIMILAR NATURES STATESMAN
HAVE MANKIND GRADUALLY PASSED FROM THE BRUTALITY AND LICENTIOUSNESS OF
PRIMITIVE MARRIAGE TO MARRIAGE CHRISTIAN AND CIVILIZED
FEW PERSONS WOULD DENY THAT WE BRING INTO THE WORLD AN INHERITANCE OF
MENTAL AND PHYSICAL QUALITIES DERIVED FIRST FROM OUR PARENTS OR THROUGH
THEM FROM SOME REMOTER ANCESTOR SECONDLY FROM OUR RACE THIRDLY FROM
THE GENERAL CONDITION OF MANKIND INTO WHICH WE ARE BORN
NOTHING IS
COMMONER THAN THE REMARK THAT 'SO AND SO IS LIKE HIS FATHER OR HIS
UNCLE' AND AN AGED PERSON MAY NOT UNFREQUENTLY NOTE A RESEMBLANCE IN
A YOUTH TO A LONG FORGOTTEN ANCESTOR OBSERVING THAT 'NATURE SOMETIMES
SKIPS A GENERATION IT MAY BE TRUE ALSO THAT IF WE KNEW MORE ABOUT
OUR ANCESTORS THESE SIMILARITIES WOULD BE EVEN MORE STRIKING TO US
ADMITTING THE FACTS WHICH ARE THUS DESCRIBED IN A POPULAR WAY WE MAY
HOWEVER REMARK THAT THERE IS NO METHOD OF DIFFERENCE BY WHICH THEY CAN
BE DEFINED OR ESTIMATED AND THAT THEY CONSTITUTE ONLY A SMALL PART OF
EACH INDIVIDUAL
THE DOCTRINE OF HEREDITY MAY SEEM TO TAKE OUT OF OUR
HANDS THE CONDUCT OF OUR OWN LIVES BUT IT IS THE IDEA NOT THE FACT
WHICH IS REALLY TERRIBLE TO US
FOR WHAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM OUR
ANCESTORS IS ONLY A FRACTION OF WHAT WE ARE OR MAY BECOME
THE
KNOWLEDGE THAT DRUNKENNESS OR INSANITY HAS BEEN PREVALENT IN A
FAMILY MAY BE THE BEST SAFEGUARD AGAINST THEIR RECURRENCE IN A FUTURE
GENERATION
THE PARENT WILL BE MOST AWAKE TO THE VICES OR DISEASES IN
HIS CHILD OF WHICH HE IS MOST SENSIBLE WITHIN HIMSELF
THE WHOLE OF LIFE
MAY BE DIRECTED TO THEIR PREVENTION OR CURE
THE TRACES OF CONSUMPTION
MAY BECOME FAINTER OR BE WHOLLY EFFACED THE INHERENT TENDENCY TO VICE
OR CRIME MAY BE ERADICATED
AND SO HEREDITY FROM BEING A CURSE MAY
BECOME A BLESSING
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN THE MATTER OF OUR BIRTH AS IN
OUR NATURE GENERALLY THERE ARE PREVIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH AFFECT
US
BUT UPON THIS PLATFORM OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR WITHIN THIS WALL OF
NECESSITY WE HAVE STILL THE POWER OF CREATING A LIFE FOR OURSELVES BY
THE INFORMING ENERGY OF THE HUMAN WILL
THERE IS ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE MARRIAGE QUESTION TO WHICH PLATO IS A
STRANGER
ALL THE CHILDREN BORN IN HIS STATE ARE FOUNDLINGS
IT NEVER
OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE GREATER PART OF THEM ACCORDING TO UNIVERSAL
EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE PERISHED
FOR CHILDREN CAN ONLY BE BROUGHT UP IN
FAMILIES
THERE IS A SUBTLE SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE MOTHER AND THE CHILD
WHICH CANNOT BE SUPPLIED BY OTHER MOTHERS OR BY 'STRONG NURSES ONE OR
MORE' LAWS
IF PLATO'S 'PEN' WAS AS FATAL AS THE CRECHES OF PARIS OR
THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL OF DUBLIN MORE THAN NINE TENTHS OF HIS CHILDREN
WOULD HAVE PERISHED
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO NEED TO EXPOSE OR PUT
OUT OF THE WAY THE WEAKLIER CHILDREN FOR THEY WOULD HAVE DIED OF
THEMSELVES
SO EMPHATICALLY DOES NATURE PROTEST AGAINST THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE FAMILY
WHAT PLATO HAD HEARD OR SEEN OF SPARTA WAS APPLIED BY HIM IN A MISTAKEN
WAY TO HIS IDEAL COMMONWEALTH
HE PROBABLY OBSERVED THAT BOTH THE
SPARTAN MEN AND WOMEN WERE SUPERIOR IN FORM AND STRENGTH TO THE OTHER
GREEKS AND THIS SUPERIORITY HE WAS DISPOSED TO ATTRIBUTE TO THE LAWS
AND CUSTOMS RELATING TO MARRIAGE
HE DID NOT CONSIDER THAT THE DESIRE
OF A NOBLE OFFSPRING WAS A PASSION AMONG THE SPARTANS OR THAT THEIR
PHYSICAL SUPERIORITY WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED CHIEFLY NOT TO THEIR MARRIAGE
CUSTOMS BUT TO THEIR TEMPERANCE AND TRAINING
HE DID NOT REFLECT THAT
SPARTA WAS GREAT NOT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE RELAXATION OF MORALITY BUT
IN SPITE OF IT BY VIRTUE OF A POLITICAL PRINCIPLE STRONGER FAR THAN
EXISTED IN ANY OTHER GRECIAN STATE
LEAST OF ALL DID HE OBSERVE THAT
SPARTA DID NOT REALLY PRODUCE THE FINEST SPECIMENS OF THE GREEK
RACE
THE GENIUS THE POLITICAL INSPIRATION OF ATHENS THE LOVE OF
LIBERTY ALL THAT HAS MADE GREECE FAMOUS WITH POSTERITY WERE WANTING
AMONG THE SPARTANS
THEY HAD NO THEMISTOCLES OR PERICLES OR AESCHYLUS
OR SOPHOCLES OR SOCRATES OR PLATO
THE INDIVIDUAL WAS NOT ALLOWED TO
APPEAR ABOVE THE STATE THE LAWS WERE FIXED AND HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO
ALTER OR REFORM THEM
YET WHENCE HAS THE PROGRESS OF CITIES AND NATIONS
ARISEN IF NOT FROM REMARKABLE INDIVIDUALS COMING INTO THE WORLD WE
KNOW NOT HOW AND FROM CAUSES OVER WHICH WE HAVE NO CONTROL
SOMETHING TOO MUCH MAY HAVE BEEN SAID IN MODERN TIMES OF THE VALUE OF
INDIVIDUALITY
BUT WE CAN HARDLY CONDEMN TOO STRONGLY A SYSTEM WHICH
INSTEAD OF FOSTERING THE SCATTERED SEEDS OR SPARKS OF GENIUS AND
CHARACTER TENDS TO SMOTHER AND EXTINGUISH THEM
STILL WHILE CONDEMNING PLATO WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NEITHER
CHRISTIANITY NOR ANY OTHER FORM OF RELIGION AND SOCIETY HAS HITHERTO
BEEN ABLE TO COPE WITH THIS MOST DIFFICULT OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND THAT
THE SIDE FROM WHICH PLATO REGARDED IT IS THAT FROM WHICH WE TURN AWAY
POPULATION IS THE MOST UNTAMEABLE FORCE IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
WORLD
DO WE NOT FIND ESPECIALLY IN LARGE CITIES THAT THE GREATEST
HINDRANCE TO THE AMELIORATION OF THE POOR IS THEIR IMPROVIDENCE IN
MARRIAGE A SMALL FAULT TRULY IF NOT INVOLVING ENDLESS CONSEQUENCES
THERE ARE WHOLE COUNTRIES TOO SUCH AS INDIA OR NEARER HOME IRELAND
IN WHICH A RIGHT SOLUTION OF THE MARRIAGE QUESTION SEEMS TO LIE AT THE
FOUNDATION OF THE HAPPINESS OF THE COMMUNITY
THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE
ON A GIVEN SPACE OR THEY MARRY TOO EARLY AND BRING INTO THE WORLD A
SICKLY AND HALF DEVELOPED OFFSPRING OR OWING TO THE VERY CONDITIONS
OF THEIR EXISTENCE THEY BECOME EMACIATED AND HAND ON A SIMILAR LIFE
TO THEIR DESCENDANTS
BUT WHO CAN OPPOSE THE VOICE OF PRUDENCE TO THE
'MIGHTIEST PASSIONS OF MANKIND' LAWS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE
BEEN LICENSED BY CUSTOM AND RELIGION IN ADDITION TO THE INFLUENCES OF
EDUCATION WE SEEM TO REQUIRE SOME NEW PRINCIPLES OF RIGHT AND WRONG IN
THESE MATTERS SOME FORCE OF OPINION WHICH MAY INDEED BE ALREADY HEARD
WHISPERING IN PRIVATE BUT HAS NEVER AFFECTED THE MORAL SENTIMENTS
OF MANKIND IN GENERAL
WE UNAVOIDABLY LOSE SIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF
UTILITY JUST IN THAT ACTION OF OUR LIVES IN WHICH WE HAVE THE MOST NEED
OF IT
THE INFLUENCES WHICH WE CAN BRING TO BEAR UPON THIS QUESTION
ARE CHIEFLY INDIRECT
IN A GENERATION OR TWO EDUCATION EMIGRATION
IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES MAY HAVE PROVIDED THE
SOLUTION
THE STATE PHYSICIAN HARDLY LIKES TO PROBE THE WOUND IT IS
BEYOND HIS ART A MATTER WHICH HE CANNOT SAFELY LET ALONE BUT WHICH HE
DARE NOT TOUCH
'WE DO BUT SKIN AND FILM THE ULCEROUS PLACE
WHEN AGAIN IN PRIVATE LIFE WE SEE A WHOLE FAMILY ONE BY ONE DROPPING
INTO THE GRAVE UNDER THE ATE OF SOME INHERITED MALADY AND THE PARENTS
PERHAPS SURVIVING THEM DO OUR MINDS EVER GO BACK SILENTLY TO THAT DAY
TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY YEARS BEFORE ON WHICH UNDER THE FAIREST AUSPICES
AMID THE REJOICINGS OF FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES A BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM
JOINED HANDS WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MAKING SUCH A REFLECTION WE ARE NOT
OPPOSING PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO MORAL BUT MORAL TO PHYSICAL WE ARE
SEEKING TO MAKE THE VOICE OF REASON HEARD WHICH DRIVES US BACK FROM THE
EXTRAVAGANCE OF SENTIMENTALISM ON COMMON SENSE
THE LATE DR
COMBE IS
SAID BY HIS BIOGRAPHER TO HAVE RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO MARRIAGE
BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS SUBJECT TO HEREDITARY CONSUMPTION
ONE WHO
DESERVED TO BE CALLED A MAN OF GENIUS A FRIEND OF MY YOUTH WAS IN THE
HABIT OF WEARING A BLACK RIBBON ON HIS WRIST IN ORDER TO REMIND HIM
THAT BEING LIABLE TO OUTBREAKS OF INSANITY HE MUST NOT GIVE WAY TO THE
NATURAL IMPULSES OF AFFECTION HE DIED UNMARRIED IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM
THESE TWO LITTLE FACTS SUGGEST THE REFLECTION THAT A VERY FEW PERSONS
HAVE DONE FROM A SENSE OF DUTY WHAT THE REST OF MANKIND OUGHT TO HAVE
DONE UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES IF THEY HAD ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO THINK
OF ALL THE MISERY WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO BRING INTO THE WORLD
IF
WE COULD PREVENT SUCH MARRIAGES WITHOUT ANY VIOLATION OF FEELING OR
PROPRIETY WE CLEARLY OUGHT AND THE PROHIBITION IN THE COURSE OF TIME
WOULD BE PROTECTED BY A 'HORROR NATURALIS' SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH IN
ALL CIVILIZED AGES AND COUNTRIES HAS PREVENTED THE MARRIAGE OF NEAR
RELATIONS BY BLOOD
MANKIND WOULD HAVE BEEN THE HAPPIER IF SOME THINGS
WHICH ARE NOW ALLOWED HAD FROM THE BEGINNING BEEN DENIED TO THEM IF THE
SANCTION OF RELIGION COULD HAVE PROHIBITED PRACTICES INIMICAL TO HEALTH
IF SANITARY PRINCIPLES COULD IN EARLY AGES HAVE BEEN INVESTED WITH A
SUPERSTITIOUS AWE
BUT LIVING AS WE DO FAR ON IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY
WE ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO STAMP AT ONCE WITH THE IMPRESS OF RELIGION A
NEW PROHIBITION
A FREE AGENT CANNOT HAVE HIS FANCIES REGULATED BY LAW
AND THE EXECUTION OF THE LAW WOULD BE RENDERED IMPOSSIBLE OWING TO THE
UNCERTAINTY OF THE CASES IN WHICH MARRIAGE WAS TO BE FORBIDDEN
WHO
CAN WEIGH VIRTUE OR EVEN FORTUNE AGAINST HEALTH OR MORAL AND MENTAL
QUALITIES AGAINST BODILY WHO CAN MEASURE PROBABILITIES AGAINST
CERTAINTIES THERE HAS BEEN SOME GOOD AS WELL AS EVIL IN THE DISCIPLINE
OF SUFFERING AND THERE ARE DISEASES SUCH AS CONSUMPTION WHICH HAVE
EXERCISED A REFINING AND SOFTENING INFLUENCE ON THE CHARACTER
YOUTH IS
TOO INEXPERIENCED TO BALANCE SUCH NICE CONSIDERATIONS PARENTS DO NOT
OFTEN THINK OF THEM OR THINK OF THEM TOO LATE
THEY ARE AT A DISTANCE
AND MAY PROBABLY BE AVERTED CHANGE OF PLACE A NEW STATE OF LIFE THE
INTERESTS OF A HOME MAY BE THE CURE OF THEM
SO PERSONS VAINLY REASON
WHEN THEIR MINDS ARE ALREADY MADE UP AND THEIR FORTUNES IRREVOCABLY
LINKED TOGETHER
NOR IS THERE ANY GROUND FOR SUPPOSING THAT MARRIAGES
ARE TO ANY GREAT EXTENT INFLUENCED BY REFLECTIONS OF THIS SORT WHICH
SEEM UNABLE TO MAKE ANY HEAD AGAINST THE IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE OF
INDIVIDUAL ATTACHMENT
LASTLY NO ONE CAN HAVE OBSERVED THE FIRST RISING FLOOD OF THE PASSIONS
IN YOUTH THE DIFFICULTY OF REGULATING THEM AND THE EFFECTS ON THE
WHOLE MIND AND NATURE WHICH FOLLOW FROM THEM THE STIMULUS WHICH
IS GIVEN TO THEM BY THE IMAGINATION WITHOUT FEELING THAT THERE IS
SOMETHING UNSATISFACTORY IN OUR METHOD OF TREATING THEM
THAT THE MOST
IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE WHOLLY LEFT TO CHANCE OR
SHROUDED IN MYSTERY AND INSTEAD OF BEING DISCIPLINED OR UNDERSTOOD
SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONFORM ONLY TO AN EXTERNAL STANDARD OF
PROPRIETY CANNOT BE REGARDED BY THE PHILOSOPHER AS A SAFE OR
SATISFACTORY CONDITION OF HUMAN THINGS
AND STILL THOSE WHO HAVE THE
CHARGE OF YOUTH MAY FIND A WAY BY WATCHFULNESS BY AFFECTION BY THE
MANLINESS AND INNOCENCE OF THEIR OWN LIVES BY OCCASIONAL HINTS BY
GENERAL ADMONITIONS WHICH EVERY ONE CAN APPLY FOR HIMSELF TO MITIGATE
THIS TERRIBLE EVIL WHICH EATS OUT THE HEART OF INDIVIDUALS AND CORRUPTS
THE MORAL SENTIMENTS OF NATIONS
IN NO DUTY TOWARDS OTHERS IS THERE MORE
NEED OF RETICENCE AND SELF RESTRAINT
SO GREAT IS THE DANGER LEST HE WHO
WOULD BE THE COUNSELLOR OF ANOTHER SHOULD REVEAL THE SECRET PREMATURELY
LEST HE SHOULD GET ANOTHER TOO MUCH INTO HIS POWER OR FIX THE PASSING
IMPRESSION OF EVIL BY DEMANDING THE CONFESSION OF IT
NOR IS PLATO WRONG IN ASSERTING THAT FAMILY ATTACHMENTS MAY INTERFERE
WITH HIGHER AIMS
IF THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WHO 'TO PARTY GAVE UP WHAT WAS
MEANT FOR MANKIND THERE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN OTHERS WHO TO FAMILY
GAVE UP WHAT WAS MEANT FOR MANKIND OR FOR THEIR COUNTRY
THE CARES
OF CHILDREN THE NECESSITY OF PROCURING MONEY FOR THEIR SUPPORT THE
FLATTERIES OF THE RICH BY THE POOR THE EXCLUSIVENESS OF CASTE THE
PRIDE OF BIRTH OR WEALTH THE TENDENCY OF FAMILY LIFE TO DIVERT MEN FROM
THE PURSUIT OF THE IDEAL OR THE HEROIC ARE AS LOWERING IN OUR OWN AGE
AS IN THAT OF PLATO
AND IF WE PREFER TO LOOK AT THE GENTLE INFLUENCES
OF HOME THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AFFECTIONS THE AMENITIES OF SOCIETY
THE DEVOTION OF ONE MEMBER OF A FAMILY FOR THE GOOD OF THE OTHERS WHICH
FORM ONE SIDE OF THE PICTURE WE MUST NOT QUARREL WITH HIM OR PERHAPS
OUGHT RATHER TO BE GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR HAVING PRESENTED TO US THE
REVERSE
WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO DEFEND PLATO ON GROUNDS OF MORALITY WE
MAY ALLOW THAT THERE IS AN ASPECT OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS NOT UNNATURALLY
LED HIM INTO ERROR
WE HARDLY APPRECIATE THE POWER WHICH THE IDEA OF THE STATE LIKE ALL
OTHER ABSTRACT IDEAS EXERCISED OVER THE MIND OF PLATO
TO US THE STATE
SEEMS TO BE BUILT UP OUT OF THE FAMILY OR SOMETIMES TO BE THE FRAMEWORK
IN WHICH FAMILY AND SOCIAL LIFE IS CONTAINED
BUT TO PLATO IN HIS
PRESENT MOOD OF MIND THE FAMILY IS ONLY A DISTURBING INFLUENCE WHICH
INSTEAD OF FILLING UP TENDS TO DISARRANGE THE HIGHER UNITY OF THE
STATE
NO ORGANIZATION IS NEEDED EXCEPT A POLITICAL WHICH
REGARDED FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW IS A MILITARY ONE
THE STATE IS
ALL SUFFICING FOR THE WANTS OF MAN AND LIKE THE IDEA OF THE CHURCH IN
LATER AGES ABSORBS ALL OTHER DESIRES AND AFFECTIONS
IN TIME OF WAR THE
THOUSAND CITIZENS ARE TO STAND LIKE A RAMPART IMPREGNABLE AGAINST THE
WORLD OR THE PERSIAN HOST IN TIME OF PEACE THE PREPARATION FOR WAR AND
THEIR DUTIES TO THE STATE WHICH ARE ALSO THEIR DUTIES TO ONE ANOTHER
TAKE UP THEIR WHOLE LIFE AND TIME
THE ONLY OTHER INTEREST WHICH IS
ALLOWED TO THEM BESIDES THAT OF WAR IS THE INTEREST OF PHILOSOPHY
WHEN
THEY ARE TOO OLD TO BE SOLDIERS THEY ARE TO RETIRE FROM ACTIVE LIFE
AND TO HAVE A SECOND NOVITIATE OF STUDY AND CONTEMPLATION
THERE IS AN
ELEMENT OF MONASTICISM EVEN IN PLATO'S COMMUNISM
IF HE COULD HAVE DONE
WITHOUT CHILDREN HE MIGHT HAVE CONVERTED HIS REPUBLIC INTO A RELIGIOUS
ORDER
NEITHER IN THE LAWS WHEN THE DAYLIGHT OF COMMON SENSE BREAKS IN
UPON HIM DOES HE RETRACT HIS ERROR
IN THE STATE OF WHICH HE WOULD BE
THE FOUNDER THERE IS NO MARRYING OR GIVING IN MARRIAGE BUT BECAUSE OF
THE INFIRMITY OF MANKIND HE CONDESCENDS TO ALLOW THE LAW OF NATURE TO
PREVAIL
C BUT PLATO HAS AN EQUAL OR IN HIS OWN ESTIMATION EVEN GREATER
PARADOX IN RESERVE WHICH IS SUMMED UP IN THE FAMOUS TEXT 'UNTIL KINGS
ARE PHILOSOPHERS OR PHILOSOPHERS ARE KINGS CITIES WILL NEVER CEASE
FROM ILL AND BY PHILOSOPHERS HE EXPLAINS HIMSELF TO MEAN THOSE WHO
ARE CAPABLE OF APPREHENDING IDEAS ESPECIALLY THE IDEA OF GOOD
TO THE
ATTAINMENT OF THIS HIGHER KNOWLEDGE THE SECOND EDUCATION IS DIRECTED
THROUGH A PROCESS OF TRAINING WHICH HAS ALREADY MADE THEM GOOD CITIZENS
THEY ARE NOW TO BE MADE GOOD LEGISLATORS
WE FIND WITH SOME SURPRISE
NOT UNLIKE THE FEELING WHICH ARISTOTLE IN A WELL KNOWN PASSAGE
DESCRIBES THE HEARERS OF PLATO'S LECTURES AS EXPERIENCING WHEN THEY
WENT TO A DISCOURSE ON THE IDEA OF GOOD EXPECTING TO BE INSTRUCTED IN
MORAL TRUTHS AND RECEIVED INSTEAD OF THEM ARITHMETICAL AND MATHEMATICAL
FORMULAE THAT PLATO DOES NOT PROPOSE FOR HIS FUTURE LEGISLATORS ANY
STUDY OF FINANCE OR LAW OR MILITARY TACTICS BUT ONLY OF ABSTRACT
MATHEMATICS AS A PREPARATION FOR THE STILL MORE ABSTRACT CONCEPTION OF
GOOD
WE ASK WITH ARISTOTLE WHAT IS THE USE OF A MAN KNOWING THE IDEA
OF GOOD IF HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL THIS
STATE THIS CONDITION OF SOCIETY WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW PLATO'S
LEGISLATORS OR GUARDIANS ARE TO BE FITTED FOR THEIR WORK OF STATESMEN BY
THE STUDY OF THE FIVE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
WE VAINLY SEARCH IN PLATO'S
OWN WRITINGS FOR ANY EXPLANATION OF THIS SEEMING ABSURDITY
THE DISCOVERY OF A GREAT METAPHYSICAL CONCEPTION SEEMS TO RAVISH THE
MIND WITH A PROPHETIC CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TAKES AWAY THE POWER
OF ESTIMATING ITS VALUE
NO METAPHYSICAL ENQUIRER HAS EVER FAIRLY
CRITICISED HIS OWN SPECULATIONS IN HIS OWN JUDGMENT THEY HAVE BEEN
ABOVE CRITICISM NOR HAS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT TO HIM SEEMED TO BE
ABSOLUTE TRUTH MAY REAPPEAR IN THE NEXT GENERATION AS A FORM OF LOGIC
OR AN INSTRUMENT OF THOUGHT
AND POSTERITY HAVE ALSO SOMETIMES EQUALLY
MISAPPREHENDED THE REAL VALUE OF HIS SPECULATIONS
THEY APPEAR TO THEM
TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED NOTHING TO THE STOCK OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
THE IDEA
OF GOOD IS APT TO BE REGARDED BY THE MODERN THINKER AS AN UNMEANING
ABSTRACTION BUT HE FORGETS THAT THIS ABSTRACTION IS WAITING READY FOR
USE AND WILL HEREAFTER BE FILLED UP BY THE DIVISIONS OF KNOWLEDGE
WHEN MANKIND DO NOT AS YET KNOW THAT THE WORLD IS SUBJECT TO LAW THE
INTRODUCTION OF THE MERE CONCEPTION OF LAW OR DESIGN OR FINAL CAUSE AND
THE FAR OFF ANTICIPATION OF THE HARMONY OF KNOWLEDGE ARE GREAT STEPS
ONWARD
EVEN THE CRUDE GENERALIZATION OF THE UNITY OF ALL THINGS LEADS
MEN TO VIEW THE WORLD WITH DIFFERENT EYES AND MAY EASILY AFFECT THEIR
CONCEPTION OF HUMAN LIFE AND OF POLITICS AND ALSO THEIR OWN CONDUCT AND
CHARACTER TIM
WE CAN IMAGINE HOW A GREAT MIND LIKE THAT OF PERICLES
MIGHT DERIVE ELEVATION FROM HIS INTERCOURSE WITH ANAXAGORAS PHAEDR
TO BE STRUGGLING TOWARDS A HIGHER BUT UNATTAINABLE CONCEPTION IS A MORE
FAVOURABLE INTELLECTUAL CONDITION THAN TO REST SATISFIED IN A NARROW
PORTION OF ASCERTAINED FACT
AND THE EARLIER WHICH HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN
THE GREATER IDEAS OF SCIENCE ARE OFTEN LOST SIGHT OF AT A LATER PERIOD
HOW RARELY CAN WE SAY OF ANY MODERN ENQUIRER IN THE MAGNIFICENT LANGUAGE
OF PLATO THAT 'HE IS THE SPECTATOR OF ALL TIME AND OF ALL EXISTENCE
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING UNNATURAL IN THE HASTY APPLICATION OF THESE VAST
METAPHYSICAL CONCEPTIONS TO PRACTICAL AND POLITICAL LIFE
IN THE FIRST
ENTHUSIASM OF IDEAS MEN ARE APT TO SEE THEM EVERYWHERE AND TO APPLY
THEM IN THE MOST REMOTE SPHERE
THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE
EXPERIENCE OF AGES IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE THEM TO FILL UP 'THE
INTERMEDIATE AXIOMS PLATO HIMSELF SEEMS TO HAVE IMAGINED THAT THE
TRUTHS OF PSYCHOLOGY LIKE THOSE OF ASTRONOMY AND HARMONICS WOULD BE
ARRIVED AT BY A PROCESS OF DEDUCTION AND THAT THE METHOD WHICH HE HAS
PURSUED IN THE FOURTH BOOK OF INFERRING THEM FROM EXPERIENCE AND THE
USE OF LANGUAGE WAS IMPERFECT AND ONLY PROVISIONAL
BUT WHEN AFTER
HAVING ARRIVED AT THE IDEA OF GOOD WHICH IS THE END OF THE SCIENCE OF
DIALECTIC HE IS ASKED WHAT IS THE NATURE AND WHAT ARE THE DIVISIONS
OF THE SCIENCE HE REFUSES TO ANSWER AS IF INTENDING BY THE REFUSAL TO
INTIMATE THAT THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH THEN EXISTED WAS NOT SUCH AS
WOULD ALLOW THE PHILOSOPHER TO ENTER INTO HIS FINAL REST
THE PREVIOUS
SCIENCES MUST FIRST BE STUDIED AND WILL WE MAY ADD CONTINUE TO BE
STUDIED TELL THE END OF TIME ALTHOUGH IN A SENSE DIFFERENT FROM ANY
WHICH PLATO COULD HAVE CONCEIVED
BUT WE MAY OBSERVE THAT WHILE HE IS
AWARE OF THE VACANCY OF HIS OWN IDEAL HE IS FULL OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE
CONTEMPLATION OF IT
LOOKING INTO THE ORB OF LIGHT HE SEES NOTHING BUT
HE IS WARMED AND ELEVATED
THE HEBREW PROPHET BELIEVED THAT FAITH IN
GOD WOULD ENABLE HIM TO GOVERN THE WORLD THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER IMAGINED
THAT CONTEMPLATION OF THE GOOD WOULD MAKE A LEGISLATOR
THERE IS AS MUCH
TO BE FILLED UP IN THE ONE CASE AS IN THE OTHER AND THE ONE MODE OF
CONCEPTION IS TO THE ISRAELITE WHAT THE OTHER IS TO THE GREEK
BOTH FIND
A REPOSE IN A DIVINE PERFECTION WHICH WHETHER IN A MORE PERSONAL OR
IMPERSONAL FORM EXISTS WITHOUT THEM AND INDEPENDENTLY OF THEM AS WELL
AS WITHIN THEM
THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD IN THE TIMAEUS NOR OF THE
DIVINE CREATOR OF THE WORLD IN THE REPUBLIC AND WE ARE NATURALLY LED
TO ASK IN WHAT RELATION THEY STAND TO ONE ANOTHER
IS GOD ABOVE OR BELOW
THE IDEA OF GOOD OR IS THE IDEA OF GOOD ANOTHER MODE OF CONCEIVING GOD
THE LATTER APPEARS TO BE THE TRUER ANSWER
TO THE GREEK PHILOSOPHER
THE PERFECTION AND UNITY OF GOD WAS A FAR HIGHER CONCEPTION THAN HIS
PERSONALITY WHICH HE HARDLY FOUND A WORD TO EXPRESS AND WHICH TO HIM
WOULD HAVE SEEMED TO BE BORROWED FROM MYTHOLOGY
TO THE CHRISTIAN ON
THE OTHER HAND OR TO THE MODERN THINKER IN GENERAL IT IS DIFFICULT
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTACH REALITY TO WHAT HE TERMS MERE ABSTRACTION
WHILE TO PLATO THIS VERY ABSTRACTION IS THE TRUEST AND MOST REAL OF ALL
THINGS
HENCE FROM A DIFFERENCE IN FORMS OF THOUGHT PLATO APPEARS TO
BE RESTING ON A CREATION OF HIS OWN MIND ONLY
BUT IF WE MAY BE ALLOWED
TO PARAPHRASE THE IDEA OF GOOD BY THE WORDS 'INTELLIGENT PRINCIPLE OF
LAW AND ORDER IN THE UNIVERSE EMBRACING EQUALLY MAN AND NATURE WE
BEGIN TO FIND A MEETING POINT BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES
THE QUESTION WHETHER THE RULER OR STATESMAN SHOULD BE A PHILOSOPHER IS
ONE THAT HAS NOT LOST INTEREST IN MODERN TIMES
IN MOST COUNTRIES OF
EUROPE AND ASIA THERE HAS BEEN SOME ONE IN THE COURSE OF AGES WHO
HAS TRULY UNITED THE POWER OF COMMAND WITH THE POWER OF THOUGHT AND
REFLECTION AS THERE HAVE BEEN ALSO MANY FALSE COMBINATIONS OF THESE
QUALITIES
SOME KIND OF SPECULATIVE POWER IS NECESSARY BOTH IN PRACTICAL
AND POLITICAL LIFE LIKE THE RHETORICIAN IN THE PHAEDRUS MEN REQUIRE TO
HAVE A CONCEPTION OF THE VARIETIES OF HUMAN CHARACTER AND TO BE RAISED
ON GREAT OCCASIONS ABOVE THE COMMONPLACES OF ORDINARY LIFE
YET THE IDEA
OF THE PHILOSOPHER STATESMAN HAS NEVER BEEN POPULAR WITH THE MASS OF
MANKIND PARTLY BECAUSE HE CANNOT TAKE THE WORLD INTO HIS CONFIDENCE OR
MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVES FROM WHICH HE ACTS AND ALSO BECAUSE
THEY ARE JEALOUS OF A POWER WHICH THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE REVOLUTION
WHICH HUMAN NATURE DESIRES TO EFFECT STEP BY STEP IN MANY AGES IS LIKELY
TO BE PRECIPITATED BY HIM IN A SINGLE YEAR OR LIFE
THEY ARE AFRAID THAT
IN THE PURSUIT OF HIS GREATER AIMS HE MAY DISREGARD THE COMMON FEELINGS
OF HUMANITY HE IS TOO APT TO BE LOOKING INTO THE DISTANT FUTURE OR BACK
INTO THE REMOTE PAST AND UNABLE TO SEE ACTIONS OR EVENTS WHICH TO USE
AN EXPRESSION OF PLATO'S 'ARE TUMBLING OUT AT HIS FEET BESIDES AS
PLATO WOULD SAY THERE ARE OTHER CORRUPTIONS OF THESE PHILOSOPHICAL
STATESMEN
EITHER 'THE NATIVE HUE OF RESOLUTION IS SICKLIED O'ER WITH
THE PALE CAST OF THOUGHT AND AT THE MOMENT WHEN ACTION ABOVE ALL
THINGS IS REQUIRED HE IS UNDECIDED OR GENERAL PRINCIPLES ARE ENUNCIATED
BY HIM IN ORDER TO COVER SOME CHANGE OF POLICY OR HIS IGNORANCE OF THE
WORLD HAS MADE HIM MORE EASILY FALL A PREY TO THE ARTS OF OTHERS OR IN
SOME CASES HE HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A COURTIER WHO ENJOYS THE LUXURY
OF HOLDING LIBERAL OPINIONS BUT WAS NEVER KNOWN TO PERFORM A LIBERAL
ACTION
NO WONDER THAT MANKIND HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF CALLING
STATESMEN OF THIS CLASS PEDANTS SOPHISTERS DOCTRINAIRES VISIONARIES
FOR AS WE MAY BE ALLOWED TO SAY A LITTLE PARODYING THE WORDS OF PLATO
'THEY HAVE SEEN BAD IMITATIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHER STATESMAN BUT A MAN
IN WHOM THE POWER OF THOUGHT AND ACTION ARE PERFECTLY BALANCED EQUAL TO
THE PRESENT REACHING FORWARD TO THE FUTURE 'SUCH A ONE RULING IN A
CONSTITUTIONAL STATE 'THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN
BUT AS THE PHILOSOPHER IS APT TO FAIL IN THE ROUTINE OF POLITICAL LIFE
SO THE ORDINARY STATESMAN IS ALSO APT TO FAIL IN EXTRAORDINARY CRISES
WHEN THE FACE OF THE WORLD IS BEGINNING TO ALTER AND THUNDER IS HEARD
IN THE DISTANCE HE IS STILL GUIDED BY HIS OLD MAXIMS AND IS THE SLAVE
OF HIS INVETERATE PARTY PREJUDICES HE CANNOT PERCEIVE THE SIGNS OF THE
TIMES INSTEAD OF LOOKING FORWARD HE LOOKS BACK HE LEARNS NOTHING AND
FORGETS NOTHING WITH 'WISE SAWS AND MODERN INSTANCES' HE WOULD STEM THE
RISING TIDE OF REVOLUTION
HE LIVES MORE AND MORE WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF
HIS OWN PARTY AS THE WORLD WITHOUT HIM BECOMES STRONGER
THIS SEEMS TO
BE THE REASON WHY THE OLD ORDER OF THINGS MAKES SO POOR A FIGURE
WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE NEW WHY CHURCHES CAN NEVER REFORM WHY MOST
POLITICAL CHANGES ARE MADE BLINDLY AND CONVULSIVELY
THE GREAT CRISES
IN THE HISTORY OF NATIONS HAVE OFTEN BEEN MET BY AN ECCLESIASTICAL
POSITIVENESS AND A MORE OBSTINATE REASSERTION OF PRINCIPLES WHICH
HAVE LOST THEIR HOLD UPON A NATION
THE FIXED IDEAS OF A REACTIONARY
STATESMAN MAY BE COMPARED TO MADNESS THEY GROW UPON HIM AND HE BECOMES
POSSESSED BY THEM NO JUDGEMENT OF OTHERS IS EVER ADMITTED BY HIM TO BE
WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE AGAINST HIS OWN
D PLATO LABOURING UNDER WHAT TO MODERN READERS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
A CONFUSION OF IDEAS ASSIMILATES THE STATE TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND FAILS
TO DISTINGUISH ETHICS FROM POLITICS
HE THINKS THAT TO BE MOST OF A
STATE WHICH IS MOST LIKE ONE MAN AND IN WHICH THE CITIZENS HAVE THE
GREATEST UNIFORMITY OF CHARACTER
HE DOES NOT SEE THAT THE ANALOGY IS
PARTLY FALLACIOUS AND THAT THE WILL OR CHARACTER OF A STATE OR NATION
IS REALLY THE BALANCE OR RATHER THE SURPLUS OF INDIVIDUAL WILLS WHICH
ARE LIMITED BY THE CONDITION OF HAVING TO ACT IN COMMON
THE MOVEMENT
OF A BODY OF MEN CAN NEVER HAVE THE PLIANCY OR FACILITY OF A SINGLE MAN
THE FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHICH IS ALWAYS LIMITED BECOMES STILL
MORE STRAITENED WHEN TRANSFERRED TO A NATION
THE POWERS OF ACTION AND
FEELING ARE NECESSARILY WEAKER AND MORE BALANCED WHEN THEY ARE DIFFUSED
THROUGH A COMMUNITY WHENCE ARISES THE OFTEN DISCUSSED QUESTION 'CAN A
NATION LIKE AN INDIVIDUAL HAVE A CONSCIENCE WE HESITATE TO SAY
THAT THE CHARACTERS OF NATIONS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN THE SUM OF THE
CHARACTERS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO COMPOSE THEM BECAUSE THERE MAY BE
TENDENCIES IN INDIVIDUALS WHICH REACT UPON ONE ANOTHER
A WHOLE NATION
MAY BE WISER THAN ANY ONE MAN IN IT OR MAY BE ANIMATED BY SOME COMMON
OPINION OR FEELING WHICH COULD NOT EQUALLY HAVE AFFECTED THE MIND OF
A SINGLE PERSON OR MAY HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY A LEADER OF GENIUS TO
PERFORM ACTS MORE THAN HUMAN
PLATO DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ANALYSED
THE COMPLICATIONS WHICH ARISE OUT OF THE COLLECTIVE ACTION OF MANKIND
NEITHER IS HE CAPABLE OF SEEING THAT ANALOGIES THOUGH SPECIOUS AS
ARGUMENTS MAY OFTEN HAVE NO FOUNDATION IN FACT OR OF DISTINGUISHING
BETWEEN WHAT IS INTELLIGIBLE OR VIVIDLY PRESENT TO THE MIND AND WHAT
IS TRUE
IN THIS RESPECT HE IS FAR BELOW ARISTOTLE WHO IS COMPARATIVELY
SELDOM IMPOSED UPON BY FALSE ANALOGIES
HE CANNOT DISENTANGLE THE ARTS
FROM THE VIRTUES AT LEAST HE IS ALWAYS ARGUING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
HIS NOTION OF MUSIC IS TRANSFERRED FROM HARMONY OF SOUNDS TO HARMONY OF
LIFE IN THIS HE IS ASSISTED BY THE AMBIGUITIES OF LANGUAGE AS WELL AS
BY THE PREVALENCE OF PYTHAGOREAN NOTIONS
AND HAVING ONCE ASSIMILATED
THE STATE TO THE INDIVIDUAL HE IMAGINES THAT HE WILL FIND THE
SUCCESSION OF STATES PARALLELED IN THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS
STILL THROUGH THIS FALLACIOUS MEDIUM A REAL ENLARGEMENT OF IDEAS IS
ATTAINED
WHEN THE VIRTUES AS YET PRESENTED NO DISTINCT CONCEPTION TO
THE MIND A GREAT ADVANCE WAS MADE BY THE COMPARISON OF THEM WITH THE
ARTS FOR VIRTUE IS PARTLY ART AND HAS AN OUTWARD FORM AS WELL AS AN
INWARD PRINCIPLE
THE HARMONY OF MUSIC AFFORDS A LIVELY IMAGE OF THE
HARMONIES OF THE WORLD AND OF HUMAN LIFE AND MAY BE REGARDED AS A
SPLENDID ILLUSTRATION WHICH WAS NATURALLY MISTAKEN FOR A REAL ANALOGY
IN THE SAME WAY THE IDENTIFICATION OF ETHICS WITH POLITICS HAS A
TENDENCY TO GIVE DEFINITENESS TO ETHICS AND ALSO TO ELEVATE AND ENNOBLE
MEN'S NOTIONS OF THE AIMS OF GOVERNMENT AND OF THE DUTIES OF CITIZENS
FOR ETHICS FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW MAY BE CONCEIVED AS AN IDEALIZED LAW
AND POLITICS AND POLITICS AS ETHICS REDUCED TO THE CONDITIONS OF HUMAN
SOCIETY
THERE HAVE BEEN EVILS WHICH HAVE ARISEN OUT OF THE ATTEMPT TO
IDENTIFY THEM AND THIS HAS LED TO THE SEPARATION OR ANTAGONISM OF
THEM WHICH HAS BEEN INTRODUCED BY MODERN POLITICAL WRITERS
BUT WE MAY
LIKEWISE FEEL THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN LOST IN THEIR SEPARATION AND
THAT THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS WHO ESTIMATED THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL
WELLBEING OF MANKIND FIRST AND THE WEALTH OF NATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS
SECOND MAY HAVE A SALUTARY INFLUENCE ON THE SPECULATIONS OF MODERN
TIMES
MANY POLITICAL MAXIMS ORIGINATE IN A REACTION AGAINST AN OPPOSITE
ERROR AND WHEN THE ERRORS AGAINST WHICH THEY WERE DIRECTED HAVE PASSED
AWAY THEY IN TURN BECOME ERRORS
3
PLATO'S VIEWS OF EDUCATION ARE IN SEVERAL RESPECTS REMARKABLE
LIKE THE REST OF THE REPUBLIC THEY ARE PARTLY GREEK AND PARTLY IDEAL
BEGINNING WITH THE ORDINARY CURRICULUM OF THE GREEK YOUTH AND EXTENDING
TO AFTER LIFE
PLATO IS THE FIRST WRITER WHO DISTINCTLY SAYS THAT
EDUCATION IS TO COMPREHEND THE WHOLE OF LIFE AND TO BE A PREPARATION
FOR ANOTHER IN WHICH EDUCATION BEGINS AGAIN
THIS IS THE CONTINUOUS
THREAD WHICH RUNS THROUGH THE REPUBLIC AND WHICH MORE THAN ANY OTHER OF
HIS IDEAS ADMITS OF AN APPLICATION TO MODERN LIFE
HE HAS LONG GIVEN UP THE NOTION THAT VIRTUE CANNOT BE TAUGHT AND HE IS
DISPOSED TO MODIFY THE THESIS OF THE PROTAGORAS THAT THE VIRTUES ARE
ONE AND NOT MANY
HE IS NOT UNWILLING TO ADMIT THE SENSIBLE WORLD
INTO HIS SCHEME OF TRUTH
NOR DOES HE ASSERT IN THE REPUBLIC THE
INVOLUNTARINESS OF VICE WHICH IS MAINTAINED BY HIM IN THE TIMAEUS
SOPHIST AND LAWS PROTAG APOL GORG
NOR DO THE SO CALLED PLATONIC
IDEAS RECOVERED FROM A FORMER STATE OF EXISTENCE AFFECT HIS THEORY
OF MENTAL IMPROVEMENT
STILL WE OBSERVE IN HIM THE REMAINS OF THE OLD
SOCRATIC DOCTRINE THAT TRUE KNOWLEDGE MUST BE ELICITED FROM WITHIN AND
IS TO BE SOUGHT FOR IN IDEAS NOT IN PARTICULARS OF SENSE
EDUCATION AS
HE SAYS WILL IMPLANT A PRINCIPLE OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS BETTER THAN
TEN THOUSAND EYES
THE PARADOX THAT THE VIRTUES ARE ONE AND THE KINDRED
NOTION THAT ALL VIRTUE IS KNOWLEDGE ARE NOT ENTIRELY RENOUNCED THE
FIRST IS SEEN IN THE SUPREMACY GIVEN TO JUSTICE OVER THE REST THE
SECOND IN THE TENDENCY TO ABSORB THE MORAL VIRTUES IN THE INTELLECTUAL
AND TO CENTRE ALL GOODNESS IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD
THE
WORLD OF SENSE IS STILL DEPRECIATED AND IDENTIFIED WITH OPINION THOUGH
ADMITTED TO BE A SHADOW OF THE TRUE
IN THE REPUBLIC HE IS EVIDENTLY
IMPRESSED WITH THE CONVICTION THAT VICE ARISES CHIEFLY FROM IGNORANCE
AND MAY BE CURED BY EDUCATION THE MULTITUDE ARE HARDLY TO BE DEEMED
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THEY DO
A FAINT ALLUSION TO THE DOCTRINE OF
REMINISCENCE OCCURS IN THE TENTH BOOK BUT PLATO'S VIEWS OF EDUCATION
HAVE NO MORE REAL CONNECTION WITH A PREVIOUS STATE OF EXISTENCE THAN
OUR OWN HE ONLY PROPOSES TO ELICIT FROM THE MIND THAT WHICH IS THERE
ALREADY
EDUCATION IS REPRESENTED BY HIM NOT AS THE FILLING OF A
VESSEL BUT AS THE TURNING THE EYE OF THE SOUL TOWARDS THE LIGHT
HE TREATS FIRST OF MUSIC OR LITERATURE WHICH HE DIVIDES INTO TRUE AND
FALSE AND THEN GOES ON TO GYMNASTICS OF INFANCY IN THE REPUBLIC HE
TAKES NO NOTICE THOUGH IN THE LAWS HE GIVES SAGE COUNSELS ABOUT THE
NURSING OF CHILDREN AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE MOTHERS AND WOULD HAVE
AN EDUCATION WHICH IS EVEN PRIOR TO BIRTH
BUT IN THE REPUBLIC HE BEGINS
WITH THE AGE AT WHICH THE CHILD IS CAPABLE OF RECEIVING IDEAS AND
BOLDLY ASSERTS IN LANGUAGE WHICH SOUNDS PARADOXICAL TO MODERN EARS
THAT HE MUST BE TAUGHT THE FALSE BEFORE HE CAN LEARN THE TRUE
THE
MODERN AND ANCIENT PHILOSOPHICAL WORLD ARE NOT AGREED ABOUT TRUTH AND
FALSEHOOD THE ONE IDENTIFIES TRUTH ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WITH FACT THE
OTHER WITH IDEAS
THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND PLATO
WHICH IS HOWEVER PARTLY A DIFFERENCE OF WORDS
FOR WE TOO SHOULD ADMIT
THAT A CHILD MUST RECEIVE MANY LESSONS WHICH HE IMPERFECTLY UNDERSTANDS
HE MUST BE TAUGHT SOME THINGS IN A FIGURE ONLY SOME TOO WHICH HE CAN
HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO BELIEVE WHEN HE GROWS OLDER BUT WE SHOULD LIMIT
THE USE OF FICTION BY THE NECESSITY OF THE CASE
PLATO WOULD DRAW THE
LINE DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO HIM THE AIM OF EARLY EDUCATION IS NOT
TRUTH AS A MATTER OF FACT BUT TRUTH AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE THE CHILD
IS TO BE TAUGHT FIRST SIMPLE RELIGIOUS TRUTHS AND THEN SIMPLE MORAL
TRUTHS AND INSENSIBLY TO LEARN THE LESSON OF GOOD MANNERS AND GOOD
TASTE
HE WOULD MAKE AN ENTIRE REFORMATION OF THE OLD MYTHOLOGY LIKE
XENOPHANES AND HERACLEITUS HE IS SENSIBLE OF THE DEEP CHASM WHICH
SEPARATES HIS OWN AGE FROM HOMER AND HESIOD WHOM HE QUOTES AND INVESTS
WITH AN IMAGINARY AUTHORITY BUT ONLY FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES
THE LUSTS
AND TREACHERIES OF THE GODS ARE TO BE BANISHED THE TERRORS OF THE WORLD
BELOW ARE TO BE DISPELLED THE MISBEHAVIOUR OF THE HOMERIC HEROES IS
NOT TO BE A MODEL FOR YOUTH
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER STRAIN HEARD IN HOMER
WHICH MAY TEACH OUR YOUTH ENDURANCE AND SOMETHING MAY BE LEARNT IN
MEDICINE FROM THE SIMPLE PRACTICE OF THE HOMERIC AGE
THE PRINCIPLES
ON WHICH RELIGION IS TO BE BASED ARE TWO ONLY FIRST THAT GOD IS TRUE
SECONDLY THAT HE IS GOOD
MODERN AND CHRISTIAN WRITERS HAVE OFTEN
FALLEN SHORT OF THESE THEY CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE BEYOND THEM
THE YOUNG ARE TO BE BROUGHT UP IN HAPPY SURROUNDINGS OUT OF THE WAY OF
SIGHTS OR SOUNDS WHICH MAY HURT THE CHARACTER OR VITIATE THE TASTE
THEY ARE TO LIVE IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF HEALTH THE BREEZE IS ALWAYS TO
BE WAFTING TO THEM THE IMPRESSIONS OF TRUTH AND GOODNESS
COULD SUCH
AN EDUCATION BE REALIZED OR IF OUR MODERN RELIGIOUS EDUCATION COULD
BE BOUND UP WITH TRUTH AND VIRTUE AND GOOD MANNERS AND GOOD TASTE THAT
WOULD BE THE BEST HOPE OF HUMAN IMPROVEMENT
PLATO LIKE OURSELVES
IS LOOKING FORWARD TO CHANGES IN THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS WORLD AND IS
PREPARING FOR THEM
HE RECOGNIZES THE DANGER OF UNSETTLING YOUNG MEN'S
MINDS BY SUDDEN CHANGES OF LAWS AND PRINCIPLES BY DESTROYING THE
SACREDNESS OF ONE SET OF IDEAS WHEN THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO TAKE THEIR
PLACE
HE IS AFRAID TOO OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DRAMA ON THE GROUND
THAT IT ENCOURAGES FALSE SENTIMENT AND THEREFORE HE WOULD NOT HAVE
HIS CHILDREN TAKEN TO THE THEATRE HE THINKS THAT THE EFFECT ON THE
SPECTATORS IS BAD AND ON THE ACTORS STILL WORSE
HIS IDEA OF EDUCATION
IS THAT OF HARMONIOUS GROWTH IN WHICH ARE INSENSIBLY LEARNT THE LESSONS
OF TEMPERANCE AND ENDURANCE AND THE BODY AND MIND DEVELOPE IN EQUAL
PROPORTIONS
THE FIRST PRINCIPLE WHICH RUNS THROUGH ALL ART AND NATURE
IS SIMPLICITY THIS ALSO IS TO BE THE RULE OF HUMAN LIFE
THE SECOND STAGE OF EDUCATION IS GYMNASTIC WHICH ANSWERS TO THE PERIOD
OF MUSCULAR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
THE SIMPLICITY WHICH IS ENFORCED IN
MUSIC IS EXTENDED TO GYMNASTIC PLATO IS AWARE THAT THE TRAINING OF THE
BODY MAY BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE TRAINING OF THE MIND AND THAT BODILY
EXERCISE MAY BE EASILY OVERDONE
EXCESSIVE TRAINING OF THE BODY IS
APT TO GIVE MEN A HEADACHE OR TO RENDER THEM SLEEPY AT A LECTURE ON
PHILOSOPHY AND THIS THEY ATTRIBUTE NOT TO THE TRUE CAUSE BUT TO THE
NATURE OF THE SUBJECT
TWO POINTS ARE NOTICEABLE IN PLATO'S TREATMENT OF
GYMNASTIC FIRST THAT THE TIME OF TRAINING IS ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM
THE TIME OF LITERARY EDUCATION
HE SEEMS TO HAVE THOUGHT THAT TWO THINGS
OF AN OPPOSITE AND DIFFERENT NATURE COULD NOT BE LEARNT AT THE SAME
TIME
HERE WE CAN HARDLY AGREE WITH HIM AND IF WE MAY JUDGE BY
EXPERIENCE THE EFFECT OF SPENDING THREE YEARS BETWEEN THE AGES OF
FOURTEEN AND SEVENTEEN IN MERE BODILY EXERCISE WOULD BE FAR FROM
IMPROVING TO THE INTELLECT
SECONDLY HE AFFIRMS THAT MUSIC AND
GYMNASTIC ARE NOT AS COMMON OPINION IS APT TO IMAGINE INTENDED THE
ONE FOR THE CULTIVATION OF THE MIND AND THE OTHER OF THE BODY BUT THAT
THEY ARE BOTH EQUALLY DESIGNED FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MIND
THE
BODY IN HIS VIEW IS THE SERVANT OF THE MIND THE SUBJECTION OF THE
LOWER TO THE HIGHER IS FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF BOTH
AND DOUBTLESS THE
MIND MAY EXERCISE A VERY GREAT AND PARAMOUNT INFLUENCE OVER THE BODY
IF EXERTED NOT AT PARTICULAR MOMENTS AND BY FITS AND STARTS BUT
CONTINUOUSLY IN MAKING PREPARATION FOR THE WHOLE OF LIFE
OTHER GREEK
WRITERS SAW THE MISCHIEVOUS TENDENCY OF SPARTAN DISCIPLINE ARIST
POL
THUC
BUT ONLY PLATO RECOGNIZED THE FUNDAMENTAL ERROR ON WHICH THE
PRACTICE WAS BASED
THE SUBJECT OF GYMNASTIC LEADS PLATO TO THE SISTER SUBJECT OF MEDICINE
WHICH HE FURTHER ILLUSTRATES BY THE PARALLEL OF LAW
THE MODERN
DISBELIEF IN MEDICINE HAS LED IN THIS AS IN SOME OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF
KNOWLEDGE TO A DEMAND FOR GREATER SIMPLICITY PHYSICIANS ARE BECOMING
AWARE THAT THEY OFTEN MAKE DISEASES 'GREATER AND MORE COMPLICATED' BY
THEIR TREATMENT OF THEM REP
IN TWO THOUSAND YEARS THEIR ART HAS MADE
BUT SLENDER PROGRESS WHAT THEY HAVE GAINED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE PARTS
IS IN A GREAT DEGREE LOST BY THEIR FEEBLER CONCEPTION OF THE HUMAN FRAME
AS A WHOLE
THEY HAVE ATTENDED MORE TO THE CURE OF DISEASES THAN TO THE
CONDITIONS OF HEALTH AND THE IMPROVEMENTS IN MEDICINE HAVE BEEN MORE
THAN COUNTERBALANCED BY THE DISUSE OF REGULAR TRAINING
UNTIL LATELY
THEY HAVE HARDLY THOUGHT OF AIR AND WATER THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH WAS
WELL UNDERSTOOD BY THE ANCIENTS AS ARISTOTLE REMARKS 'AIR AND WATER
BEING THE ELEMENTS WHICH WE MOST USE HAVE THE GREATEST EFFECT UPON
HEALTH' POLIT
FOR AGES PHYSICIANS HAVE BEEN UNDER THE DOMINION OF
PREJUDICES WHICH HAVE ONLY RECENTLY GIVEN WAY AND NOW THERE ARE AS MANY
OPINIONS IN MEDICINE AS IN THEOLOGY AND AN EQUAL DEGREE OF SCEPTICISM
AND SOME WANT OF TOLERATION ABOUT BOTH
PLATO HAS SEVERAL GOOD NOTIONS
ABOUT MEDICINE ACCORDING TO HIM 'THE EYE CANNOT BE CURED WITHOUT THE
REST OF THE BODY NOR THE BODY WITHOUT THE MIND' CHARM
NO MAN
OF SENSE HE SAYS IN THE TIMAEUS WOULD TAKE PHYSIC AND WE HEARTILY
SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM IN THE LAWS WHEN HE DECLARES THAT 'THE LIMBS OF THE
RUSTIC WORN WITH TOIL WILL DERIVE MORE BENEFIT FROM WARM BATHS THAN FROM
THE PRESCRIPTIONS OF A NOT OVER WISE DOCTOR BUT WE CAN HARDLY PRAISE
HIM WHEN IN OBEDIENCE TO THE AUTHORITY OF HOMER HE DEPRECIATES DIET
OR APPROVE OF THE INHUMAN SPIRIT IN WHICH HE WOULD GET RID OF INVALID
AND USELESS LIVES BY LEAVING THEM TO DIE
HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE
CONSIDERED THAT THE 'BRIDLE OF THEAGES' MIGHT BE ACCOMPANIED BY
QUALITIES WHICH WERE OF FAR MORE VALUE TO THE STATE THAN THE HEALTH
OR STRENGTH OF THE CITIZENS OR THAT THE DUTY OF TAKING CARE OF THE
HELPLESS MIGHT BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF EDUCATION IN A STATE
THE
PHYSICIAN HIMSELF THIS IS A DELICATE AND SUBTLE OBSERVATION SHOULD
NOT BE A MAN IN ROBUST HEALTH HE SHOULD HAVE IN MODERN PHRASEOLOGY
A NERVOUS TEMPERAMENT HE SHOULD HAVE EXPERIENCE OF DISEASE IN HIS OWN
PERSON IN ORDER THAT HIS POWERS OF OBSERVATION MAY BE QUICKENED IN THE
CASE OF OTHERS
THE PERPLEXITY OF MEDICINE IS PARALLELED BY THE PERPLEXITY OF LAW IN
WHICH AGAIN PLATO WOULD HAVE MEN FOLLOW THE GOLDEN RULE OF SIMPLICITY
GREATER MATTERS ARE TO BE DETERMINED BY THE LEGISLATOR OR BY THE ORACLE
OF DELPHI LESSER MATTERS ARE TO BE LEFT TO THE TEMPORARY REGULATION
OF THE CITIZENS THEMSELVES
PLATO IS AWARE THAT LAISSEZ FAIRE IS AN
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF GOVERNMENT
THE DISEASES OF A STATE ARE LIKE THE
HEADS OF A HYDRA THEY MULTIPLY WHEN THEY ARE CUT OFF
THE TRUE REMEDY
FOR THEM IS NOT EXTIRPATION BUT PREVENTION
AND THE WAY TO PREVENT THEM
IS TO TAKE CARE OF EDUCATION AND EDUCATION WILL TAKE CARE OF ALL THE
REST
SO IN MODERN TIMES MEN HAVE OFTEN FELT THAT THE ONLY POLITICAL
MEASURE WORTH HAVING THE ONLY ONE WHICH WOULD PRODUCE ANY CERTAIN OR
LASTING EFFECT WAS A MEASURE OF NATIONAL EDUCATION
AND IN OUR OWN MORE
THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS AGE THE NECESSITY HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED OF RESTORING
THE EVER INCREASING CONFUSION OF LAW TO SIMPLICITY AND COMMON SENSE
WHEN THE TRAINING IN MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC IS COMPLETED THERE FOLLOWS THE
FIRST STAGE OF ACTIVE AND PUBLIC LIFE
BUT SOON EDUCATION IS TO BEGIN
AGAIN FROM A NEW POINT OF VIEW
IN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE FOURTH AND
SEVENTH BOOKS WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE THENCE
BEEN LED TO FORM A HIGHER CONCEPTION OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF US
FOR
TRUE KNOWLEDGE ACCORDING TO PLATO IS OF ABSTRACTIONS AND HAS TO DO
NOT WITH PARTICULARS OR INDIVIDUALS BUT WITH UNIVERSALS ONLY NOT WITH
THE BEAUTIES OF POETRY BUT WITH THE IDEAS OF PHILOSOPHY
AND THE GREAT
AIM OF EDUCATION IS THE CULTIVATION OF THE HABIT OF ABSTRACTION
THIS
IS TO BE ACQUIRED THROUGH THE STUDY OF THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
THEY
ALONE ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING IDEAS OF RELATION AND OF AROUSING THE
DORMANT ENERGIES OF THOUGHT
MATHEMATICS IN THE AGE OF PLATO COMPREHENDED A VERY SMALL PART OF THAT
WHICH IS NOW INCLUDED IN THEM BUT THEY BORE A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION TO
THE SUM OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
THEY WERE THE ONLY ORGANON OF THOUGHT WHICH
THE HUMAN MIND AT THAT TIME POSSESSED AND THE ONLY MEASURE BY WHICH
THE CHAOS OF PARTICULARS COULD BE REDUCED TO RULE AND ORDER
THE
FACULTY WHICH THEY TRAINED WAS NATURALLY AT WAR WITH THE POETICAL
OR IMAGINATIVE AND HENCE TO PLATO WHO IS EVERYWHERE SEEKING FOR
ABSTRACTIONS AND TRYING TO GET RID OF THE ILLUSIONS OF SENSE NEARLY
THE WHOLE OF EDUCATION IS CONTAINED IN THEM
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE AN
INEXHAUSTIBLE APPLICATION PARTLY BECAUSE THEIR TRUE LIMITS WERE NOT YET
UNDERSTOOD
THESE PLATO HIMSELF IS BEGINNING TO INVESTIGATE THOUGH
NOT AWARE THAT NUMBER AND FIGURE ARE MERE ABSTRACTIONS OF SENSE
HE RECOGNIZES THAT THE FORMS USED BY GEOMETRY ARE BORROWED FROM THE
SENSIBLE WORLD
HE SEEKS TO FIND THE ULTIMATE GROUND OF MATHEMATICAL
IDEAS IN THE IDEA OF GOOD THOUGH HE DOES NOT SATISFACTORILY EXPLAIN THE
CONNEXION BETWEEN THEM AND IN HIS CONCEPTION OF THE RELATION OF IDEAS
TO NUMBERS HE FALLS VERY FAR SHORT OF THE DEFINITENESS ATTRIBUTED TO
HIM BY ARISTOTLE MET
BUT IF HE FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUE LIMITS OF
MATHEMATICS HE ALSO REACHES A POINT BEYOND THEM IN HIS VIEW IDEAS
OF NUMBER BECOME SECONDARY TO A HIGHER CONCEPTION OF KNOWLEDGE
THE
DIALECTICIAN IS AS MUCH ABOVE THE MATHEMATICIAN AS THE MATHEMATICIAN IS
ABOVE THE ORDINARY MAN
THE ONE THE SELF PROVING THE GOOD WHICH IS
THE HIGHER SPHERE OF DIALECTIC IS THE PERFECT TRUTH TO WHICH ALL THINGS
ASCEND AND IN WHICH THEY FINALLY REPOSE
THIS SELF PROVING UNITY OR IDEA OF GOOD IS A MERE VISION OF WHICH NO
DISTINCT EXPLANATION CAN BE GIVEN RELATIVE ONLY TO A PARTICULAR STAGE
IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY
IT IS AN ABSTRACTION UNDER WHICH NO INDIVIDUALS
ARE COMPREHENDED A WHOLE WHICH HAS NO PARTS ARIST NIC
ETH
THE
VACANCY OF SUCH A FORM WAS PERCEIVED BY ARISTOTLE BUT NOT BY PLATO
NOR DID HE RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE DIALECTICAL PROCESS ARE INCLUDED TWO OR
MORE METHODS OF INVESTIGATION WHICH ARE AT VARIANCE WITH EACH OTHER
HE DID NOT SEE THAT WHETHER HE TOOK THE LONGER OR THE SHORTER ROAD NO
ADVANCE COULD BE MADE IN THIS WAY
AND YET SUCH VISIONS OFTEN HAVE AN
IMMENSE EFFECT FOR ALTHOUGH THE METHOD OF SCIENCE CANNOT ANTICIPATE
SCIENCE THE IDEA OF SCIENCE NOT AS IT IS BUT AS IT WILL BE IN THE
FUTURE IS A GREAT AND INSPIRING PRINCIPLE
IN THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE
WE ARE ALWAYS PRESSING FORWARD TO SOMETHING BEYOND US AND AS A FALSE
CONCEPTION OF KNOWLEDGE FOR EXAMPLE THE SCHOLASTIC PHILOSOPHY MAY LEAD
MEN ASTRAY DURING MANY AGES SO THE TRUE IDEAL THOUGH VACANT MAY DRAW
ALL THEIR THOUGHTS IN A RIGHT DIRECTION
IT MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE
WHETHER THE GENERAL EXPECTATION OF KNOWLEDGE AS THIS INDEFINITE FEELING
MAY BE TERMED IS BASED UPON A SOUND JUDGMENT
FOR MANKIND MAY OFTEN
ENTERTAIN A TRUE CONCEPTION OF WHAT KNOWLEDGE OUGHT TO BE WHEN THEY HAVE
BUT A SLENDER EXPERIENCE OF FACTS
THE CORRELATION OF THE SCIENCES THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE UNITY OF NATURE THE IDEA OF CLASSIFICATION THE
SENSE OF PROPORTION THE UNWILLINGNESS TO STOP SHORT OF CERTAINTY OR TO
CONFOUND PROBABILITY WITH TRUTH ARE IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES OF THE HIGHER
EDUCATION
ALTHOUGH PLATO COULD TELL US NOTHING AND PERHAPS KNEW THAT
HE COULD TELL US NOTHING OF THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH HE HAS EXERCISED
AN INFLUENCE ON THE HUMAN MIND WHICH EVEN AT THE PRESENT DAY IS NOT
EXHAUSTED AND POLITICAL AND SOCIAL QUESTIONS MAY YET ARISE IN WHICH THE
THOUGHTS OF PLATO MAY BE READ ANEW AND RECEIVE A FRESH MEANING
THE IDEA OF GOOD IS SO CALLED ONLY IN THE REPUBLIC BUT THERE ARE TRACES
OF IT IN OTHER DIALOGUES OF PLATO
IT IS A CAUSE AS WELL AS AN IDEA AND
FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW MAY BE COMPARED WITH THE CREATOR OF THE TIMAEUS
WHO OUT OF HIS GOODNESS CREATED ALL THINGS
IT CORRESPONDS TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT WITH THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF A LAW OF NATURE OR OF A FINAL
CAUSE OR OF BOTH IN ONE AND IN THIS REGARD MAY BE CONNECTED WITH THE
MEASURE AND SYMMETRY OF THE PHILEBUS
IT IS REPRESENTED IN THE SYMPOSIUM
UNDER THE ASPECT OF BEAUTY AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE ATTAINED THERE BY
STAGES OF INITIATION AS HERE BY REGULAR GRADATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE
VIEWED
SUBJECTIVELY IT IS THE PROCESS OR SCIENCE OF DIALECTIC
THIS IS THE
SCIENCE WHICH ACCORDING TO THE PHAEDRUS IS THE TRUE BASIS OF RHETORIC
WHICH ALONE IS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE NATURES AND CLASSES OF MEN AND
THINGS WHICH DIVIDES A WHOLE INTO THE NATURAL PARTS AND REUNITES THE
SCATTERED PARTS INTO A NATURAL OR ORGANIZED WHOLE WHICH DEFINES THE
ABSTRACT ESSENCES OR UNIVERSAL IDEAS OF ALL THINGS AND CONNECTS THEM
WHICH PIERCES THE VEIL OF HYPOTHESES AND REACHES THE FINAL CAUSE OR
FIRST PRINCIPLE OF ALL WHICH REGARDS THE SCIENCES IN RELATION TO THE
IDEA OF GOOD
THIS IDEAL SCIENCE IS THE HIGHEST PROCESS OF THOUGHT
AND MAY BE DESCRIBED AS THE SOUL CONVERSING WITH HERSELF OR HOLDING
COMMUNION WITH ETERNAL TRUTH AND BEAUTY AND IN ANOTHER FORM IS
THE EVERLASTING QUESTION AND ANSWER THE CEASELESS INTERROGATIVE OF
SOCRATES
THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO ARE THEMSELVES EXAMPLES OF THE NATURE
AND METHOD OF DIALECTIC
VIEWED OBJECTIVELY THE IDEA OF GOOD IS A POWER
OR CAUSE WHICH MAKES THE WORLD WITHOUT US CORRESPOND WITH THE WORLD
WITHIN
YET THIS WORLD WITHOUT US IS STILL A WORLD OF IDEAS
WITH PLATO
THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE IS ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OF KNOWLEDGE AND IN
THIS HE SEEKS TO ATTAIN ONLY PROBABLE CONCLUSIONS TIMAEUS
IF WE ASK WHETHER THIS SCIENCE OF DIALECTIC WHICH PLATO ONLY HALF
EXPLAINS TO US IS MORE AKIN TO LOGIC OR TO METAPHYSICS THE ANSWER IS
THAT IN HIS MIND THE TWO SCIENCES ARE NOT AS YET DISTINGUISHED ANY MORE
THAN THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE ASPECTS OF THE WORLD AND OF MAN WHICH
GERMAN PHILOSOPHY HAS REVEALED TO US
NOR HAS HE DETERMINED WHETHER
HIS SCIENCE OF DIALECTIC IS AT REST OR IN MOTION CONCERNED WITH THE
CONTEMPLATION OF ABSOLUTE BEING OR WITH A PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT
AND EVOLUTION
MODERN METAPHYSICS MAY BE DESCRIBED AS THE SCIENCE OF
ABSTRACTIONS OR AS THE SCIENCE OF THE EVOLUTION OF THOUGHT MODERN
LOGIC WHEN PASSING BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF MERE ARISTOTELIAN FORMS MAY BE
DEFINED AS THE SCIENCE OF METHOD
THE GERM OF BOTH OF THEM IS CONTAINED
IN THE PLATONIC DIALECTIC ALL METAPHYSICIANS HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON
WITH THE IDEAS OF PLATO ALL LOGICIANS HAVE DERIVED SOMETHING FROM
THE METHOD OF PLATO
THE NEAREST APPROACH IN MODERN PHILOSOPHY TO THE
UNIVERSAL SCIENCE OF PLATO IS TO BE FOUND IN THE HEGELIAN 'SUCCESSION
OF MOMENTS IN THE UNITY OF THE IDEA PLATO AND HEGEL ALIKE SEEM TO
HAVE CONCEIVED THE WORLD AS THE CORRELATION OF ABSTRACTIONS AND NOT
IMPOSSIBLY THEY WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN ANY OF
THEIR COMMENTATORS UNDERSTAND THEM SWIFT'S VOYAGE TO LAPUTA
'HAVING
A DESIRE TO SEE THOSE ANCIENTS WHO WERE MOST RENOWNED FOR WIT AND
LEARNING I SET APART ONE DAY ON PURPOSE
I PROPOSED THAT HOMER AND
ARISTOTLE MIGHT APPEAR AT THE HEAD OF ALL THEIR COMMENTATORS BUT THESE
WERE SO NUMEROUS THAT SOME HUNDREDS WERE FORCED TO ATTEND IN THE COURT
AND OUTWARD ROOMS OF THE PALACE
I KNEW AND COULD DISTINGUISH THESE TWO
HEROES AT FIRST SIGHT NOT ONLY FROM THE CROWD BUT FROM EACH OTHER
HOMER WAS THE TALLER AND COMELIER PERSON OF THE TWO WALKED VERY ERECT
FOR ONE OF HIS AGE AND HIS EYES WERE THE MOST QUICK AND PIERCING I EVER
BEHELD
ARISTOTLE STOOPED MUCH AND MADE USE OF A STAFF
HIS VISAGE WAS
MEAGRE HIS HAIR LANK AND THIN AND HIS VOICE HOLLOW
I SOON DISCOVERED
THAT BOTH OF THEM WERE PERFECT STRANGERS TO THE REST OF THE COMPANY
AND HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF THEM BEFORE
AND I HAD A WHISPER FROM A
GHOST WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS THAT THESE COMMENTATORS ALWAYS KEPT IN
THE MOST DISTANT QUARTERS FROM THEIR PRINCIPALS IN THE LOWER WORLD
THROUGH A CONSCIOUSNESS OF SHAME AND GUILT BECAUSE THEY HAD SO HORRIBLY
MISREPRESENTED THE MEANING OF THESE AUTHORS TO POSTERITY I INTRODUCED
DIDYMUS AND EUSTATHIUS TO HOMER AND PREVAILED ON HIM TO TREAT THEM
BETTER THAN PERHAPS THEY DESERVED FOR HE SOON FOUND THEY WANTED A
GENIUS TO ENTER INTO THE SPIRIT OF A POET
BUT ARISTOTLE WAS OUT OF ALL
PATIENCE WITH THE ACCOUNT I GAVE HIM OF SCOTUS AND RAMUS AS I PRESENTED
THEM TO HIM AND HE ASKED THEM WHETHER THE REST OF THE TRIBE WERE AS
GREAT DUNCES AS THEMSELVES
THERE IS HOWEVER A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THEM FOR WHEREAS HEGEL IS THINKING OF ALL THE MINDS OF MEN AS ONE MIND
WHICH DEVELOPES THE STAGES OF THE IDEA IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OR AT
DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE SAME COUNTRY WITH PLATO THESE GRADATIONS ARE
REGARDED ONLY AS AN ORDER OF THOUGHT OR IDEAS THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN
MIND HAD NOT YET DAWNED UPON HIM
MANY CRITICISMS MAY BE MADE ON PLATO'S THEORY OF EDUCATION
WHILE IN
SOME RESPECTS HE UNAVOIDABLY FALLS SHORT OF MODERN THINKERS IN OTHERS
HE IS IN ADVANCE OF THEM
HE IS OPPOSED TO THE MODES OF EDUCATION WHICH
PREVAILED IN HIS OWN TIME BUT HE CAN HARDLY BE SAID TO HAVE DISCOVERED
NEW ONES
HE DOES NOT SEE THAT EDUCATION IS RELATIVE TO THE CHARACTERS
OF INDIVIDUALS HE ONLY DESIRES TO IMPRESS THE SAME FORM OF THE STATE ON
THE MINDS OF ALL
HE HAS NO SUFFICIENT IDEA OF THE EFFECT OF LITERATURE
ON THE FORMATION OF THE MIND AND GREATLY EXAGGERATES THAT OF
MATHEMATICS
HIS AIM IS ABOVE ALL THINGS TO TRAIN THE REASONING
FACULTIES TO IMPLANT IN THE MIND THE SPIRIT AND POWER OF ABSTRACTION
TO EXPLAIN AND DEFINE GENERAL NOTIONS AND IF POSSIBLE TO CONNECT
THEM
NO WONDER THAT IN THE VACANCY OF ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE HIS FOLLOWERS
AND AT TIMES EVEN HE HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE FALLEN AWAY FROM THE DOCTRINE
OF IDEAS AND HAVE RETURNED TO THAT BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH ALONE
THE RELATION OF THE ONE AND MANY CAN BE TRULY SEEN THE SCIENCE OF
NUMBER
IN HIS VIEWS BOTH OF TEACHING AND TRAINING HE MIGHT BE STYLED
IN MODERN LANGUAGE A DOCTRINAIRE AFTER THE SPARTAN FASHION HE WOULD
HAVE HIS CITIZENS CAST IN ONE MOULD HE DOES NOT SEEM TO CONSIDER THAT
SOME DEGREE OF FREEDOM 'A LITTLE WHOLESOME NEGLECT IS NECESSARY TO
STRENGTHEN AND DEVELOPE THE CHARACTER AND TO GIVE PLAY TO THE INDIVIDUAL
NATURE
HIS CITIZENS WOULD NOT HAVE ACQUIRED THAT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IN
THE VISION OF ER IS SUPPOSED TO BE GAINED BY THE PILGRIMS FROM THEIR
EXPERIENCE OF EVIL
ON THE OTHER HAND PLATO IS FAR IN ADVANCE OF MODERN PHILOSOPHERS AND
THEOLOGIANS WHEN HE TEACHES THAT EDUCATION IS TO BE CONTINUED THROUGH
LIFE AND WILL BEGIN AGAIN IN ANOTHER
HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW EDUCATION OF
SOME KIND TO CEASE ALTHOUGH HE WAS AWARE THAT THE PROVERBIAL SAYING OF
SOLON 'I GROW OLD LEARNING MANY THINGS CANNOT BE APPLIED LITERALLY
HIMSELF RAVISHED WITH THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD AND
DELIGHTING IN SOLID GEOMETRY REP HE HAS NO DIFFICULTY IN IMAGINING
THAT A LIFETIME MIGHT BE PASSED HAPPILY IN SUCH PURSUITS
WE WHO KNOW
HOW MANY MORE MEN OF BUSINESS THERE ARE IN THE WORLD THAN REAL STUDENTS
OR THINKERS ARE NOT EQUALLY SANGUINE
THE EDUCATION WHICH HE PROPOSES
FOR HIS CITIZENS IS REALLY THE IDEAL LIFE OF THE PHILOSOPHER OR MAN OF
GENIUS INTERRUPTED BUT ONLY FOR A TIME BY PRACTICAL DUTIES A LIFE
NOT FOR THE MANY BUT FOR THE FEW
YET THE THOUGHT OF PLATO MAY NOT BE WHOLLY INCAPABLE OF APPLICATION TO
OUR OWN TIMES
EVEN IF REGARDED AS AN IDEAL WHICH CAN NEVER BE REALIZED
IT MAY HAVE A GREAT EFFECT IN ELEVATING THE CHARACTERS OF MANKIND
AND RAISING THEM ABOVE THE ROUTINE OF THEIR ORDINARY OCCUPATION OR
PROFESSION
IT IS THE BEST FORM UNDER WHICH WE CAN CONCEIVE THE WHOLE
OF LIFE
NEVERTHELESS THE IDEA OF PLATO IS NOT EASILY PUT INTO PRACTICE
FOR THE EDUCATION OF AFTER LIFE IS NECESSARILY THE EDUCATION WHICH EACH
ONE GIVES HIMSELF
MEN AND WOMEN CANNOT BE BROUGHT TOGETHER IN SCHOOLS
OR COLLEGES AT FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS OF AGE AND IF THEY COULD THE RESULT
WOULD BE DISAPPOINTING
THE DESTINATION OF MOST MEN IS WHAT PLATO WOULD
CALL 'THE DEN' FOR THE WHOLE OF LIFE AND WITH THAT THEY ARE CONTENT
NEITHER HAVE THEY TEACHERS OR ADVISERS WITH WHOM THEY CAN TAKE COUNSEL
IN RIPER YEARS
THERE IS NO 'SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD' WHO WILL TELL THEM OF
THEIR FAULTS OR INSPIRE THEM WITH THE HIGHER SENSE OF DUTY OR WITH THE
AMBITION OF A TRUE SUCCESS IN LIFE NO SOCRATES WHO WILL CONVICT THEM
OF IGNORANCE NO CHRIST OR FOLLOWER OF CHRIST WHO WILL REPROVE THEM
OF SIN
HENCE THEY HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN RECEIVING THE FIRST ELEMENT OF
IMPROVEMENT WHICH IS SELF KNOWLEDGE
THE HOPES OF YOUTH NO LONGER STIR
THEM THEY RATHER WISH TO REST THAN TO PURSUE HIGH OBJECTS
A FEW
ONLY WHO HAVE COME ACROSS GREAT MEN AND WOMEN OR EMINENT TEACHERS OF
RELIGION AND MORALITY HAVE RECEIVED A SECOND LIFE FROM THEM AND HAVE
LIGHTED A CANDLE FROM THE FIRE OF THEIR GENIUS
THE WANT OF ENERGY IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY SO FEW PERSONS
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE IN LATER YEARS
THEY HAVE NOT THE WILL AND DO NOT
KNOW THE WAY
THEY 'NEVER TRY AN EXPERIMENT OR LOOK UP A POINT
OF INTEREST FOR THEMSELVES THEY MAKE NO SACRIFICES FOR THE SAKE OF
KNOWLEDGE THEIR MINDS LIKE THEIR BODIES AT A CERTAIN AGE BECOME
FIXED
GENIUS HAS BEEN DEFINED AS 'THE POWER OF TAKING PAINS' BUT
HARDLY ANY ONE KEEPS UP HIS INTEREST IN KNOWLEDGE THROUGHOUT A WHOLE
LIFE
THE TROUBLES OF A FAMILY THE BUSINESS OF MAKING MONEY THE
DEMANDS OF A PROFESSION DESTROY THE ELASTICITY OF THE MIND
THE WAXEN
TABLET OF THE MEMORY WHICH WAS ONCE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING 'TRUE THOUGHTS
AND CLEAR IMPRESSIONS' BECOMES HARD AND CROWDED THERE IS NOT ROOM
FOR THE ACCUMULATIONS OF A LONG LIFE THEAET
THE STUDENT AS YEARS
ADVANCE RATHER MAKES AN EXCHANGE OF KNOWLEDGE THAN ADDS TO HIS STORES
THERE IS NO PRESSING NECESSITY TO LEARN THE STOCK OF CLASSICS OR
HISTORY OR NATURAL SCIENCE WHICH WAS ENOUGH FOR A MAN AT TWENTY FIVE IS
ENOUGH FOR HIM AT FIFTY
NEITHER IS IT EASY TO GIVE A DEFINITE ANSWER TO
ANY ONE WHO ASKS HOW HE IS TO IMPROVE
FOR SELF EDUCATION CONSISTS IN A
THOUSAND THINGS COMMONPLACE IN THEMSELVES IN ADDING TO WHAT WE ARE
BY NATURE SOMETHING OF WHAT WE ARE NOT IN LEARNING TO SEE OURSELVES AS
OTHERS SEE US IN JUDGING NOT BY OPINION BUT BY THE EVIDENCE OF FACTS
IN SEEKING OUT THE SOCIETY OF SUPERIOR MINDS IN A STUDY OF LIVES AND
WRITINGS OF GREAT MEN IN OBSERVATION OF THE WORLD AND CHARACTER IN
RECEIVING KINDLY THE NATURAL INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT TIMES OF LIFE IN
ANY ACT OR THOUGHT WHICH IS RAISED ABOVE THE PRACTICE OR OPINIONS OF
MANKIND IN THE PURSUIT OF SOME NEW OR ORIGINAL ENQUIRY IN ANY EFFORT
OF MIND WHICH CALLS FORTH SOME LATENT POWER
IF ANY ONE IS DESIROUS OF CARRYING OUT IN DETAIL THE PLATONIC EDUCATION
OF AFTER LIFE SOME SUCH COUNSELS AS THE FOLLOWING MAY BE OFFERED TO
HIM THAT HE SHALL CHOOSE THE BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE TO WHICH HIS OWN MIND
MOST DISTINCTLY INCLINES AND IN WHICH HE TAKES THE GREATEST DELIGHT
EITHER ONE WHICH SEEMS TO CONNECT WITH HIS OWN DAILY EMPLOYMENT OR
PERHAPS FURNISHES THE GREATEST CONTRAST TO IT
HE MAY STUDY FROM THE
SPECULATIVE SIDE THE PROFESSION OR BUSINESS IN WHICH HE IS PRACTICALLY
ENGAGED
HE MAY MAKE HOMER DANTE SHAKESPEARE PLATO BACON THE FRIENDS
AND COMPANIONS OF HIS LIFE
HE MAY FIND OPPORTUNITIES OF HEARING THE
LIVING VOICE OF A GREAT TEACHER
HE MAY SELECT FOR ENQUIRY SOME POINT OF
HISTORY OR SOME UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENON OF NATURE
AN HOUR A DAY PASSED
IN SUCH SCIENTIFIC OR LITERARY PURSUITS WILL FURNISH AS MANY FACTS AS
THE MEMORY CAN RETAIN AND WILL GIVE HIM 'A PLEASURE NOT TO BE REPENTED
OF' TIMAEUS
ONLY LET HIM BEWARE OF BEING THE SLAVE OF CROTCHETS OR
OF RUNNING AFTER A WILL O' THE WISP IN HIS IGNORANCE OR IN HIS VANITY
OF ATTRIBUTING TO HIMSELF THE GIFTS OF A POET OR ASSUMING THE AIR OF
A PHILOSOPHER
HE SHOULD KNOW THE LIMITS OF HIS OWN POWERS
BETTER TO
BUILD UP THE MIND BY SLOW ADDITIONS TO CREEP ON QUIETLY FROM ONE
THING TO ANOTHER TO GAIN INSENSIBLY NEW POWERS AND NEW INTERESTS IN
KNOWLEDGE THAN TO FORM VAST SCHEMES WHICH ARE NEVER DESTINED TO BE
REALIZED
BUT PERHAPS AS PLATO WOULD SAY 'THIS IS PART OF ANOTHER
SUBJECT' TIM THOUGH WE MAY ALSO DEFEND OUR DIGRESSION BY HIS EXAMPLE
THEAET
4
WE REMARK WITH SURPRISE THAT THE PROGRESS OF NATIONS OR THE NATURAL
GROWTH OF INSTITUTIONS WHICH FILL MODERN TREATISES ON POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY SEEM HARDLY EVER TO HAVE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF PLATO
AND ARISTOTLE
THE ANCIENTS WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE MUTABILITY OF HUMAN
AFFAIRS THEY COULD MORALIZE OVER THE RUINS OF CITIES AND THE FALL OF
EMPIRES PLATO STATESMAN AND SULPICIUS' LETTER TO CICERO BY THEM
FATE AND CHANCE WERE DEEMED TO BE REAL POWERS ALMOST PERSONS AND
TO HAVE HAD A GREAT SHARE IN POLITICAL EVENTS
THE WISER OF THEM LIKE
THUCYDIDES BELIEVED THAT 'WHAT HAD BEEN WOULD BE AGAIN AND THAT A
TOLERABLE IDEA OF THE FUTURE COULD BE GATHERED FROM THE PAST
ALSO THEY
HAD DREAMS OF A GOLDEN AGE WHICH EXISTED ONCE UPON A TIME AND MIGHT
STILL EXIST IN SOME UNKNOWN LAND OR MIGHT RETURN AGAIN IN THE REMOTE
FUTURE
BUT THE REGULAR GROWTH OF A STATE ENLIGHTENED BY EXPERIENCE
PROGRESSING IN KNOWLEDGE IMPROVING IN THE ARTS OF WHICH THE CITIZENS
WERE EDUCATED BY THE FULFILMENT OF POLITICAL DUTIES APPEARS NEVER TO
HAVE COME WITHIN THE RANGE OF THEIR HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS
SUCH A STATE
HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE CONCEIVED BY THEM
THEIR
EXPERIENCE ARISTOT
METAPH PLATO LAWS LED THEM TO CONCLUDE THAT
THERE HAD BEEN CYCLES OF CIVILIZATION IN WHICH THE ARTS HAD BEEN
DISCOVERED AND LOST MANY TIMES OVER AND CITIES HAD BEEN OVERTHROWN AND
REBUILT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND DELUGES AND VOLCANOES AND OTHER NATURAL
CONVULSIONS HAD ALTERED THE FACE OF THE EARTH
TRADITION TOLD THEM OF
MANY DESTRUCTIONS OF MANKIND AND OF THE PRESERVATION OF A REMNANT
THE WORLD BEGAN AGAIN AFTER A DELUGE AND WAS RECONSTRUCTED OUT OF THE
FRAGMENTS OF ITSELF
ALSO THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH EMPIRES OF UNKNOWN
ANTIQUITY LIKE THE EGYPTIAN OR ASSYRIAN BUT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THEM
GROW AND COULD NOT IMAGINE ANY MORE THAN WE CAN THE STATE OF MAN
WHICH PRECEDED THEM
THEY WERE PUZZLED AND AWESTRICKEN BY THE EGYPTIAN
MONUMENTS OF WHICH THE FORMS AS PLATO SAYS NOT IN A FIGURE BUT
LITERALLY WERE TEN THOUSAND YEARS OLD LAWS AND THEY CONTRASTED THE
ANTIQUITY OF EGYPT WITH THEIR OWN SHORT MEMORIES
THE EARLY LEGENDS OF HELLAS HAVE NO REAL CONNECTION WITH THE LATER
HISTORY THEY ARE AT A DISTANCE AND THE INTERMEDIATE REGION IS
CONCEALED FROM VIEW THERE IS NO ROAD OR PATH WHICH LEADS FROM ONE TO
THE OTHER
AT THE BEGINNING OF GREEK HISTORY IN THE VESTIBULE OF THE
TEMPLE IS SEEN STANDING FIRST OF ALL THE FIGURE OF THE LEGISLATOR
HIMSELF THE INTERPRETER AND SERVANT OF THE GOD
THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS
WHICH HE GIVES ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO CHANGE WITH TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES
THE SALVATION OF THE STATE IS HELD RATHER TO DEPEND ON THE INVIOLABLE
MAINTENANCE OF THEM
THEY WERE SANCTIONED BY THE AUTHORITY OF HEAVEN
AND IT WAS DEEMED IMPIETY TO ALTER THEM
THE DESIRE TO MAINTAIN
THEM UNALTERED SEEMS TO BE THE ORIGIN OF WHAT AT FIRST SIGHT IS VERY
SURPRISING TO US THE INTOLERANT ZEAL OF PLATO AGAINST INNOVATORS IN
RELIGION OR POLITICS LAWS ALTHOUGH WITH A HAPPY INCONSISTENCY HE
IS ALSO WILLING THAT THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES SHOULD BE STUDIED AND
IMPROVEMENTS IN LEGISLATION PRIVATELY COMMUNICATED TO THE NOCTURNAL
COUNCIL LAWS
THE ADDITIONS WHICH WERE MADE TO THEM IN LATER AGES IN
ORDER TO MEET THE INCREASING COMPLEXITY OF AFFAIRS WERE STILL ASCRIBED
BY A FICTION TO THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATOR AND THE WORDS OF SUCH
ENACTMENTS AT ATHENS WERE DISPUTED OVER AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE WORDS OF
SOLON HIMSELF
PLATO HOPES TO PRESERVE IN A LATER GENERATION THE MIND OF
THE LEGISLATOR HE WOULD HAVE HIS CITIZENS REMAIN WITHIN THE LINES
WHICH HE HAS LAID DOWN FOR THEM
HE WOULD NOT HARASS THEM WITH MINUTE
REGULATIONS HE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED SOME CHANGES IN THE LAWS BUT NOT
CHANGES WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE FUNDAMENTAL INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE
SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS WOULD CONVERT AN ARISTOCRACY INTO A TIMOCRACY OR A
TIMOCRACY INTO A POPULAR FORM OF GOVERNMENT
PASSING FROM SPECULATIONS TO FACTS WE OBSERVE THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN
THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE LAW OF HUMAN HISTORY
AND THEREFORE WE ARE
NOT SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE IDEA OF PROGRESS IS OF MODERN RATHER THAN
OF ANCIENT DATE AND LIKE THE IDEA OF A PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY IS
NOT MORE THAN A CENTURY OR TWO OLD
IT SEEMS TO HAVE ARISEN OUT OF THE
IMPRESSION LEFT ON THE HUMAN MIND BY THE GROWTH OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
AND OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND TO BE DUE TO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
IMPROVEMENTS WHICH THEY INTRODUCED INTO THE WORLD AND STILL MORE IN
OUR OWN CENTURY TO THE IDEALISM OF THE FIRST FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE
TRIUMPH OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE AND IN A YET GREATER DEGREE TO THE
VAST MATERIAL PROSPERITY AND GROWTH OF POPULATION IN ENGLAND AND HER
COLONIES AND IN AMERICA
IT IS ALSO TO BE ASCRIBED IN A MEASURE TO THE
GREATER STUDY OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
THE OPTIMIST TEMPERAMENT OF
SOME GREAT WRITERS HAS ASSISTED THE CREATION OF IT WHILE THE OPPOSITE
CHARACTER HAS LED A FEW TO REGARD THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD AS DARK
THE 'SPECTATOR OF ALL TIME AND OF ALL EXISTENCE' SEES MORE OF 'THE
INCREASING PURPOSE WHICH THROUGH THE AGES RAN' THAN FORMERLY BUT TO THE
INHABITANT OF A SMALL STATE OF HELLAS THE VISION WAS NECESSARILY LIMITED
LIKE THE VALLEY IN WHICH HE DWELT
THERE WAS NO REMOTE PAST ON WHICH HIS
EYE COULD REST NOR ANY FUTURE FROM WHICH THE VEIL WAS PARTLY LIFTED UP
BY THE ANALOGY OF HISTORY
THE NARROWNESS OF VIEW WHICH TO OURSELVES
APPEARS SO SINGULAR WAS TO HIM NATURAL IF NOT UNAVOIDABLE
5
FOR THE RELATION OF THE REPUBLIC TO THE STATESMAN AND THE LAWS AND
THE TWO OTHER WORKS OF PLATO WHICH DIRECTLY TREAT OF POLITICS SEE THE
INTRODUCTIONS TO THE TWO LATTER A FEW GENERAL POINTS OF COMPARISON MAY
BE TOUCHED UPON IN THIS PLACE
AND FIRST OF THE LAWS
1 THE REPUBLIC THOUGH PROBABLY WRITTEN AT INTERVALS YET SPEAKING
GENERALLY AND JUDGING BY THE INDICATIONS OF THOUGHT AND STYLE MAY BE
REASONABLY ASCRIBED TO THE MIDDLE PERIOD OF PLATO'S LIFE THE LAWS ARE
CERTAINLY THE WORK OF HIS DECLINING YEARS AND SOME PORTIONS OF THEM AT
ANY RATE SEEM TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN EXTREME OLD AGE
2 THE REPUBLIC IS FULL OF HOPE AND ASPIRATION THE LAWS BEAR THE STAMP
OF FAILURE AND DISAPPOINTMENT
THE ONE IS A FINISHED WORK WHICH RECEIVED
THE LAST TOUCHES OF THE AUTHOR THE OTHER IS IMPERFECTLY EXECUTED AND
APPARENTLY UNFINISHED
THE ONE HAS THE GRACE AND BEAUTY OF YOUTH THE
OTHER HAS LOST THE POETICAL FORM BUT HAS MORE OF THE SEVERITY AND
KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF OLD AGE
3 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS DEFECT OF THE LAWS IS THE FAILURE OF DRAMATIC
POWER WHEREAS THE REPUBLIC IS FULL OF STRIKING CONTRASTS OF IDEAS AND
OPPOSITIONS OF CHARACTER
4 THE LAWS MAY BE SAID TO HAVE MORE THE NATURE OF A SERMON
THE REPUBLIC OF A POEM THE ONE IS MORE RELIGIOUS THE OTHER MORE
INTELLECTUAL
5 MANY THEORIES OF PLATO SUCH AS THE DOCTRINE OF IDEAS THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD BY PHILOSOPHERS ARE NOT FOUND IN THE LAWS
THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IS FIRST MENTIONED IN XII THE PERSON OF
SOCRATES HAS ALTOGETHER DISAPPEARED
THE COMMUNITY OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN
IS RENOUNCED THE INSTITUTION OF COMMON OR PUBLIC MEALS FOR WOMEN LAWS
IS FOR THE FIRST TIME INTRODUCED AR
POL
6 THERE REMAINS IN THE LAWS THE OLD ENMITY TO THE POETS WHO ARE
IRONICALLY SALUTED IN HIGH FLOWN TERMS AND AT THE SAME TIME ARE
PEREMPTORILY ORDERED OUT OF THE CITY IF THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO SUBMIT
THEIR POEMS TO THE CENSORSHIP OF THE MAGISTRATES REP
7 THOUGH THE WORK IS IN MOST RESPECTS INFERIOR THERE ARE A FEW
PASSAGES IN THE LAWS SUCH AS THE HONOUR DUE TO THE SOUL THE EVILS
OF LICENTIOUS OR UNNATURAL LOVE THE WHOLE OF BOOK X
RELIGION THE
DISHONESTY OF RETAIL TRADE AND BEQUESTS WHICH COME MORE HOME TO US
AND CONTAIN MORE OF WHAT MAY BE TERMED THE MODERN ELEMENT IN PLATO THAN
ALMOST ANYTHING IN THE REPUBLIC
THE RELATION OF THE TWO WORKS TO ONE ANOTHER IS VERY WELL GIVEN
1 BY ARISTOTLE IN THE POLITICS FROM THE SIDE OF THE LAWS
'THE SAME OR NEARLY THE SAME OBJECTIONS APPLY TO PLATO'S LATER WORK
THE LAWS AND THEREFORE WE HAD BETTER EXAMINE BRIEFLY THE CONSTITUTION
WHICH IS THEREIN DESCRIBED
IN THE REPUBLIC SOCRATES HAS DEFINITELY
SETTLED IN ALL A FEW QUESTIONS ONLY SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY OF WOMEN AND
CHILDREN THE COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE
THE POPULATION IS DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES ONE OF HUSBANDMEN AND
THE OTHER OF WARRIORS FROM THIS LATTER IS TAKEN A THIRD CLASS OF
COUNSELLORS AND RULERS OF THE STATE
BUT SOCRATES HAS NOT DETERMINED
WHETHER THE HUSBANDMEN AND ARTISTS ARE TO HAVE A SHARE IN THE
GOVERNMENT AND WHETHER THEY TOO ARE TO CARRY ARMS AND SHARE IN MILITARY
SERVICE OR NOT
HE CERTAINLY THINKS THAT THE WOMEN OUGHT TO SHARE IN THE
EDUCATION OF THE GUARDIANS AND TO FIGHT BY THEIR SIDE
THE REMAINDER OF
THE WORK IS FILLED UP WITH DIGRESSIONS FOREIGN TO THE MAIN SUBJECT AND
WITH DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF THE GUARDIANS
IN THE LAWS THERE
IS HARDLY ANYTHING BUT LAWS NOT MUCH IS SAID ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION
THIS WHICH HE HAD INTENDED TO MAKE MORE OF THE ORDINARY TYPE HE
GRADUALLY BRINGS ROUND TO THE OTHER OR IDEAL FORM
FOR WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE COMMUNITY OF WOMEN AND PROPERTY HE SUPPOSES EVERYTHING
TO BE THE SAME IN BOTH STATES THERE IS TO BE THE SAME EDUCATION THE
CITIZENS OF BOTH ARE TO LIVE FREE FROM SERVILE OCCUPATIONS AND THERE
ARE TO BE COMMON MEALS IN BOTH
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN THE LAWS
THE COMMON MEALS ARE EXTENDED TO WOMEN AND THE WARRIORS NUMBER ABOUT
5000 BUT IN THE REPUBLIC ONLY 1000
2 BY PLATO IN THE LAWS BOOK V FROM THE SIDE OF THE REPUBLIC
'THE FIRST AND HIGHEST FORM OF THE STATE AND OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OF
THE LAW IS THAT IN WHICH THERE PREVAILS MOST WIDELY THE ANCIENT SAYING
THAT FRIENDS HAVE ALL THINGS IN COMMON WHETHER THERE IS NOW OR EVER
WILL BE THIS COMMUNION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND OF PROPERTY IN WHICH
THE PRIVATE AND INDIVIDUAL IS ALTOGETHER BANISHED FROM LIFE AND THINGS
WHICH ARE BY NATURE PRIVATE SUCH AS EYES AND EARS AND HANDS HAVE
BECOME COMMON AND ALL MEN EXPRESS PRAISE AND BLAME AND FEEL JOY
AND SORROW ON THE SAME OCCASIONS AND THE LAWS UNITE THE CITY TO THE
UTMOST WHETHER ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE OR NOT I SAY THAT NO MAN ACTING
UPON ANY OTHER PRINCIPLE WILL EVER CONSTITUTE A STATE MORE EXALTED IN
VIRTUE OR TRUER OR BETTER THAN THIS
SUCH A STATE WHETHER INHABITED
BY GODS OR SONS OF GODS WILL MAKE THEM BLESSED WHO DWELL THEREIN AND
THEREFORE TO THIS WE ARE TO LOOK FOR THE PATTERN OF THE STATE AND TO
CLING TO THIS AND AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO SEEK FOR ONE WHICH IS LIKE
THIS
THE STATE WHICH WE HAVE NOW IN HAND WHEN CREATED WILL BE NEAREST
TO IMMORTALITY AND UNITY IN THE NEXT DEGREE AND AFTER THAT BY THE
GRACE OF GOD WE WILL COMPLETE THE THIRD ONE
AND WE WILL BEGIN BY
SPEAKING OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE SECOND
THE COMPARATIVELY SHORT WORK CALLED THE STATESMAN OR POLITICUS IN ITS
STYLE AND MANNER IS MORE AKIN TO THE LAWS WHILE IN ITS IDEALISM
IT RATHER RESEMBLES THE REPUBLIC
AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE BY VARIOUS
INDICATIONS OF LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT IT MUST BE LATER THAN THE ONE AND
OF COURSE EARLIER THAN THE OTHER
IN BOTH THE REPUBLIC AND STATESMAN A
CLOSE CONNECTION IS MAINTAINED BETWEEN POLITICS AND DIALECTIC
IN THE
STATESMAN ENQUIRIES INTO THE PRINCIPLES OF METHOD ARE INTERSPERSED WITH
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT POLITICS
THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE RULE OF
LAW AND OF A PERSON ARE CONSIDERED AND THE DECISION GIVEN IN FAVOUR OF
A PERSON ARIST
POL
BUT MUCH MAY BE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE NOR IS
THE OPPOSITION NECESSARY FOR A PERSON MAY RULE BY LAW AND LAW MAY
BE SO APPLIED AS TO BE THE LIVING VOICE OF THE LEGISLATOR
AS IN THE
REPUBLIC THERE IS A MYTH DESCRIBING HOWEVER NOT A FUTURE BUT A
FORMER EXISTENCE OF MANKIND
THE QUESTION IS ASKED 'WHETHER THE STATE
OF INNOCENCE WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN THE MYTH OR A STATE LIKE OUR OWN
WHICH POSSESSES ART AND SCIENCE AND DISTINGUISHES GOOD FROM EVIL IS
THE PREFERABLE CONDITION OF MAN TO THIS QUESTION OF THE COMPARATIVE
HAPPINESS OF CIVILIZED AND PRIMITIVE LIFE WHICH WAS SO OFTEN DISCUSSED
IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IN OUR OWN NO ANSWER IS GIVEN
THE STATESMAN
THOUGH LESS PERFECT IN STYLE THAN THE REPUBLIC AND OF FAR LESS RANGE
MAY JUSTLY BE REGARDED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF PLATO'S DIALOGUES
6
OTHERS AS WELL AS PLATO HAVE CHOSEN AN IDEAL REPUBLIC TO BE THE
VEHICLE OF THOUGHTS WHICH THEY COULD NOT DEFINITELY EXPRESS OR WHICH
WENT BEYOND THEIR OWN AGE
THE CLASSICAL WRITING WHICH APPROACHES MOST
NEARLY TO THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO IS THE 'DE REPUBLICA' OF CICERO BUT
NEITHER IN THIS NOR IN ANY OTHER OF HIS DIALOGUES DOES HE RIVAL THE
ART OF PLATO
THE MANNERS ARE CLUMSY AND INFERIOR THE HAND OF THE
RHETORICIAN IS APPARENT AT EVERY TURN
YET NOBLE SENTIMENTS ARE
CONSTANTLY RECURRING THE TRUE NOTE OF ROMAN PATRIOTISM 'WE ROMANS ARE
A GREAT PEOPLE' RESOUNDS THROUGH THE WHOLE WORK
LIKE SOCRATES CICERO
TURNS AWAY FROM THE PHENOMENA OF THE HEAVENS TO CIVIL AND POLITICAL
LIFE
HE WOULD RATHER NOT DISCUSS THE 'TWO SUNS' OF WHICH ALL ROME WAS
TALKING WHEN HE CAN CONVERSE ABOUT 'THE TWO NATIONS IN ONE' WHICH HAD
DIVIDED ROME EVER SINCE THE DAYS OF THE GRACCHI
LIKE SOCRATES AGAIN
SPEAKING IN THE PERSON OF SCIPIO HE IS AFRAID LEST HE SHOULD ASSUME
TOO MUCH THE CHARACTER OF A TEACHER RATHER THAN OF AN EQUAL WHO IS
DISCUSSING AMONG FRIENDS THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
HE WOULD CONFINE
THE TERMS KING OR STATE TO THE RULE OF REASON AND JUSTICE AND HE WILL
NOT CONCEDE THAT TITLE EITHER TO A DEMOCRACY OR TO A MONARCHY
BUT UNDER
THE RULE OF REASON AND JUSTICE HE IS WILLING TO INCLUDE THE NATURAL
SUPERIOR RULING OVER THE NATURAL INFERIOR WHICH HE COMPARES TO THE SOUL
RULING OVER THE BODY
HE PREFERS A MIXTURE OF FORMS OF GOVERNMENT TO ANY
SINGLE ONE
THE TWO PORTRAITS OF THE JUST AND THE UNJUST WHICH OCCUR IN
THE SECOND BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE PHILUS
ONE OF THE INTERLOCUTORS MAINTAINING AGAINST HIS WILL THE NECESSITY
OF INJUSTICE AS A PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT WHILE THE OTHER LAELIUS
SUPPORTS THE OPPOSITE THESIS
HIS VIEWS OF LANGUAGE AND NUMBER ARE
DERIVED FROM PLATO LIKE HIM HE DENOUNCES THE DRAMA
HE ALSO DECLARES
THAT IF HIS LIFE WERE TO BE TWICE AS LONG HE WOULD HAVE NO TIME TO READ
THE LYRIC POETS
THE PICTURE OF DEMOCRACY IS TRANSLATED BY HIM WORD FOR
WORD THOUGH HE HAD HARDLY SHOWN HIMSELF ABLE TO 'CARRY THE JEST' OF
PLATO
HE CONVERTS INTO A STATELY SENTENCE THE HUMOROUS FANCY ABOUT THE
ANIMALS WHO 'ARE SO IMBUED WITH THE SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY THAT THEY MAKE
THE PASSERS BY GET OUT OF THEIR WAY HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE TYRANT IS
IMITATED FROM PLATO BUT IS FAR INFERIOR
THE SECOND BOOK IS HISTORICAL
AND CLAIMS FOR THE ROMAN CONSTITUTION WHICH IS TO HIM THE IDEAL A
FOUNDATION OF FACT SUCH AS PLATO PROBABLY INTENDED TO HAVE GIVEN TO THE
REPUBLIC IN THE CRITIAS
HIS MOST REMARKABLE IMITATION OF PLATO IS THE
ADAPTATION OF THE VISION OF ER WHICH IS CONVERTED BY CICERO INTO THE
'SOMNIUM SCIPIONIS' HE HAS 'ROMANIZED' THE MYTH OF THE REPUBLIC ADDING
AN ARGUMENT FOR THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL TAKEN FROM THE PHAEDRUS
AND SOME OTHER TOUCHES DERIVED FROM THE PHAEDO AND THE TIMAEUS
THOUGH A
BEAUTIFUL TALE AND CONTAINING SPLENDID PASSAGES THE 'SOMNIUM SCIPIONIS
IS VERY INFERIOR TO THE VISION OF ER IT IS ONLY A DREAM AND HARDLY
ALLOWS THE READER TO SUPPOSE THAT THE WRITER BELIEVES IN HIS OWN
CREATION
WHETHER HIS DIALOGUES WERE FRAMED ON THE MODEL OF THE LOST
DIALOGUES OF ARISTOTLE AS HE HIMSELF TELLS US OR OF PLATO TO WHICH
THEY BEAR MANY SUPERFICIAL RESEMBLANCES HE IS STILL THE ROMAN ORATOR
HE IS NOT CONVERSING BUT MAKING SPEECHES AND IS NEVER ABLE TO MOULD
THE INTRACTABLE LATIN TO THE GRACE AND EASE OF THE GREEK PLATONIC
DIALOGUE
BUT IF HE IS DEFECTIVE IN FORM MUCH MORE IS HE INFERIOR TO
THE GREEK IN MATTER HE NOWHERE IN HIS PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS LEAVES
UPON OUR MINDS THE IMPRESSION OF AN ORIGINAL THINKER
PLATO'S REPUBLIC HAS BEEN SAID TO BE A CHURCH AND NOT A STATE AND SUCH
AN IDEAL OF A CITY IN THE HEAVENS HAS ALWAYS HOVERED OVER THE CHRISTIAN
WORLD AND IS EMBODIED IN ST
AUGUSTINE'S 'DE CIVITATE DEI WHICH IS
SUGGESTED BY THE DECAY AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE MUCH IN THE SAME
MANNER IN WHICH WE MAY IMAGINE THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO TO HAVE BEEN
INFLUENCED BY THE DECLINE OF GREEK POLITICS IN THE WRITER'S OWN AGE
THE
DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN THE TIME OF PLATO THE DEGENERACY THOUGH CERTAIN
WAS GRADUAL AND INSENSIBLE WHEREAS THE TAKING OF ROME BY THE GOTHS
STIRRED LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE THE AGE OF ST
AUGUSTINE
MEN WERE INCLINED
TO BELIEVE THAT THE OVERTHROW OF THE CITY WAS TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE
ANGER FELT BY THE OLD ROMAN DEITIES AT THE NEGLECT OF THEIR WORSHIP
ST
AUGUSTINE MAINTAINS THE OPPOSITE THESIS HE ARGUES THAT THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE IS DUE NOT TO THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY BUT TO
THE VICES OF PAGANISM
HE WANDERS OVER ROMAN HISTORY AND OVER GREEK
PHILOSOPHY AND MYTHOLOGY AND FINDS EVERYWHERE CRIME IMPIETY AND
FALSEHOOD
HE COMPARES THE WORST PARTS OF THE GENTILE RELIGIONS WITH
THE BEST ELEMENTS OF THE FAITH OF CHRIST
HE SHOWS NOTHING OF THE SPIRIT
WHICH LED OTHERS OF THE EARLY CHRISTIAN FATHERS TO RECOGNIZE IN THE
WRITINGS OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS THE POWER OF THE DIVINE TRUTH
HE
TRACES THE PARALLEL OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD THAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE
JEWS CONTAINED IN THEIR SCRIPTURES AND OF THE KINGDOMS OF THE WORLD
WHICH ARE FOUND IN GENTILE WRITERS AND PURSUES THEM BOTH INTO AN IDEAL
FUTURE
IT NEED HARDLY BE REMARKED THAT HIS USE BOTH OF GREEK AND
OF ROMAN HISTORIANS AND OF THE SACRED WRITINGS OF THE JEWS IS WHOLLY
UNCRITICAL
THE HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY THE SYBILLINE ORACLES THE MYTHS
OF PLATO THE DREAMS OF NEO PLATONISTS ARE EQUALLY REGARDED BY HIM AS
MATTER OF FACT
HE MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE A STRICTLY POLEMICAL OR
CONTROVERSIAL WRITER WHO MAKES THE BEST OF EVERYTHING ON ONE SIDE AND
THE WORST OF EVERYTHING ON THE OTHER
HE HAS NO SYMPATHY WITH THE OLD
ROMAN LIFE AS PLATO HAS WITH GREEK LIFE NOR HAS HE ANY IDEA OF THE
ECCLESIASTICAL KINGDOM WHICH WAS TO ARISE OUT OF THE RUINS OF THE ROMAN
EMPIRE
HE IS NOT BLIND TO THE DEFECTS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AND
LOOKS FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN CHRISTIAN AND PAGAN SHALL BE ALIKE BROUGHT
BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT AND THE TRUE CITY OF GOD SHALL APPEAR THE
WORK OF ST
AUGUSTINE IS A CURIOUS REPERTORY OF ANTIQUARIAN LEARNING AND
QUOTATIONS DEEPLY PENETRATED WITH CHRISTIAN ETHICS BUT SHOWING LITTLE
POWER OF REASONING AND A SLENDER KNOWLEDGE OF THE GREEK LITERATURE
AND LANGUAGE
HE WAS A GREAT GENIUS AND A NOBLE CHARACTER YET HARDLY
CAPABLE OF FEELING OR UNDERSTANDING ANYTHING EXTERNAL TO HIS OWN
THEOLOGY
OF ALL THE ANCIENT PHILOSOPHERS HE IS MOST ATTRACTED BY PLATO
THOUGH HE IS VERY SLIGHTLY ACQUAINTED WITH HIS WRITINGS
HE IS INCLINED
TO BELIEVE THAT THE IDEA OF CREATION IN THE TIMAEUS IS DERIVED FROM THE
NARRATIVE IN GENESIS AND HE IS STRANGELY TAKEN WITH THE COINCIDENCE
OF PLATO'S SAYING THAT 'THE PHILOSOPHER IS THE LOVER OF GOD AND
THE WORDS OF THE BOOK OF EXODUS IN WHICH GOD REVEALS HIMSELF TO MOSES
EXOD HE DWELLS AT LENGTH ON MIRACLES PERFORMED IN HIS OWN DAY OF
WHICH THE EVIDENCE IS REGARDED BY HIM AS IRRESISTIBLE
HE SPEAKS IN A
VERY INTERESTING MANNER OF THE BEAUTY AND UTILITY OF NATURE AND OF THE
HUMAN FRAME WHICH HE CONCEIVES TO AFFORD A FORETASTE OF THE HEAVENLY
STATE AND OF THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY
THE BOOK IS NOT REALLY WHAT
TO MOST PERSONS THE TITLE OF IT WOULD IMPLY AND BELONGS TO AN AGE WHICH
HAS PASSED AWAY
BUT IT CONTAINS MANY FINE PASSAGES AND THOUGHTS WHICH
ARE FOR ALL TIME
THE SHORT TREATISE DE MONARCHIA OF DANTE IS BY FAR THE MOST REMARKABLE
OF MEDIAEVAL IDEALS AND BEARS THE IMPRESS OF THE GREAT GENIUS IN WHOM
ITALY AND THE MIDDLE AGES ARE SO VIVIDLY REFLECTED
IT IS THE VISION OF
AN UNIVERSAL EMPIRE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE NATURAL AND NECESSARY
GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD HAVING A DIVINE AUTHORITY DISTINCT FROM THE
PAPACY YET COEXTENSIVE WITH IT
IT IS NOT 'THE GHOST OF THE DEAD ROMAN
EMPIRE SITTING CROWNED UPON THE GRAVE THEREOF BUT THE LEGITIMATE HEIR
AND SUCCESSOR OF IT JUSTIFIED BY THE ANCIENT VIRTUES OF THE ROMANS AND
THE BENEFICENCE OF THEIR RULE
THEIR RIGHT TO BE THE GOVERNORS OF THE
WORLD IS ALSO CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF MIRACLES AND ACKNOWLEDGED
BY ST
PAUL WHEN HE APPEALED TO CAESAR AND EVEN MORE EMPHATICALLY BY
CHRIST HIMSELF WHO COULD NOT HAVE MADE ATONEMENT FOR THE SINS OF MEN
IF HE HAD NOT BEEN CONDEMNED BY A DIVINELY AUTHORIZED TRIBUNAL
THE
NECESSITY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN UNIVERSAL EMPIRE IS PROVED PARTLY
BY A PRIORI ARGUMENTS SUCH AS THE UNITY OF GOD AND THE UNITY OF THE
FAMILY OR NATION PARTLY BY PERVERSIONS OF SCRIPTURE AND HISTORY BY
FALSE ANALOGIES OF NATURE BY MISAPPLIED QUOTATIONS FROM THE CLASSICS
AND BY ODD SCRAPS AND COMMONPLACES OF LOGIC SHOWING A FAMILIAR BUT BY
NO MEANS EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF ARISTOTLE OF PLATO THERE IS NONE
BUT
A MORE CONVINCING ARGUMENT STILL IS THE MISERABLE STATE OF THE WORLD
WHICH HE TOUCHINGLY DESCRIBES
HE SEES NO HOPE OF HAPPINESS OR PEACE
FOR MANKIND UNTIL ALL NATIONS OF THE EARTH ARE COMPREHENDED IN A SINGLE
EMPIRE
THE WHOLE TREATISE SHOWS HOW DEEPLY THE IDEA OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
WAS FIXED IN THE MINDS OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES
NOT MUCH ARGUMENT WAS
NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THE TRUTH OF A THEORY WHICH TO HIS OWN CONTEMPORARIES
SEEMED SO NATURAL AND CONGENIAL
HE SPEAKS OR RATHER PREACHES FROM THE
POINT OF VIEW NOT OF THE ECCLESIASTIC BUT OF THE LAYMAN ALTHOUGH AS
A GOOD CATHOLIC HE IS WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN CERTAIN RESPECTS
THE EMPIRE MUST SUBMIT TO THE CHURCH
THE BEGINNING AND END OF ALL HIS
NOBLE REFLECTIONS AND OF HIS ARGUMENTS GOOD AND BAD IS THE ASPIRATION
'THAT IN THIS LITTLE PLOT OF EARTH BELONGING TO MORTAL MAN LIFE MAY PASS
IN FREEDOM AND PEACE SO INEXTRICABLY IS HIS VISION OF THE FUTURE BOUND
UP WITH THE BELIEFS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS OWN AGE
THE 'UTOPIA' OF SIR THOMAS MORE IS A SURPRISING MONUMENT OF HIS GENIUS
AND SHOWS A REACH OF THOUGHT FAR BEYOND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
THE BOOK WAS
WRITTEN BY HIM AT THE AGE OF ABOUT 34 OR 35 AND IS FULL OF THE GENEROUS
SENTIMENTS OF YOUTH
HE BRINGS THE LIGHT OF PLATO TO BEAR UPON THE
MISERABLE STATE OF HIS OWN COUNTRY
LIVING NOT LONG AFTER THE WARS OF
THE ROSES AND IN THE DREGS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN ENGLAND HE IS
INDIGNANT AT THE CORRUPTION OF THE CLERGY AT THE LUXURY OF THE NOBILITY
AND GENTRY AT THE SUFFERINGS OF THE POOR AT THE CALAMITIES CAUSED BY
WAR
TO THE EYE OF MORE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS IN DISSOLUTION AND DECAY
AND SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE MISERY AND OPPRESSION WHICH HE HAS DESCRIBED
IN THE FIRST BOOK OF THE UTOPIA HE PLACES IN THE SECOND BOOK THE IDEAL
STATE WHICH BY THE HELP OF PLATO HE HAD CONSTRUCTED
THE TIMES WERE FULL
OF STIR AND INTELLECTUAL INTEREST
THE DISTANT MURMUR OF THE REFORMATION
WAS BEGINNING TO BE HEARD
TO MINDS LIKE MORE'S GREEK LITERATURE WAS
A REVELATION THERE HAD ARISEN AN ART OF INTERPRETATION AND THE NEW
TESTAMENT WAS BEGINNING TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS IT HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE
AND HAS NOT OFTEN BEEN SINCE IN ITS NATURAL SENSE
THE LIFE THERE
DEPICTED APPEARED TO HIM WHOLLY UNLIKE THAT OF CHRISTIAN COMMONWEALTHS
IN WHICH 'HE SAW NOTHING BUT A CERTAIN CONSPIRACY OF RICH MEN PROCURING
THEIR OWN COMMODITIES UNDER THE NAME AND TITLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH
HE THOUGHT THAT CHRIST LIKE PLATO 'INSTITUTED ALL THINGS COMMON FOR
WHICH REASON HE TELLS US THE CITIZENS OF UTOPIA WERE THE MORE WILLING
TO RECEIVE HIS DOCTRINES 'HOWBEIT I THINK THIS WAS NO SMALL HELP AND
FURTHERANCE IN THE MATTER THAT THEY HEARD US SAY THAT CHRIST INSTITUTED
AMONG HIS ALL THINGS COMMON AND THAT THE SAME COMMUNITY DOTH YET
REMAIN IN THE RIGHTEST CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES' UTOPIA
THE COMMUNITY
OF PROPERTY IS A FIXED IDEA WITH HIM THOUGH HE IS AWARE OF THE
ARGUMENTS WHICH MAY BE URGED ON THE OTHER SIDE 'THESE THINGS I SAY
WHEN I CONSIDER WITH MYSELF I HOLD WELL WITH PLATO AND DO NOTHING
MARVEL THAT HE WOULD MAKE NO LAWS FOR THEM THAT REFUSED THOSE LAWS
WHEREBY ALL MEN SHOULD HAVE AND ENJOY EQUAL PORTIONS OF RICHES AND
COMMODITIES
FOR THE WISE MEN DID EASILY FORESEE THIS TO BE THE ONE AND
ONLY WAY TO THE WEALTH OF A COMMUNITY IF EQUALITY OF ALL THINGS SHOULD
BE BROUGHT IN AND ESTABLISHED' UTOPIA
WE WONDER HOW IN THE REIGN OF
HENRY VIII THOUGH VEILED IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE AND PUBLISHED IN A FOREIGN
COUNTRY SUCH SPECULATIONS COULD HAVE BEEN ENDURED
HE IS GIFTED WITH FAR GREATER DRAMATIC INVENTION THAN ANY ONE WHO
SUCCEEDED HIM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SWIFT
IN THE ART OF FEIGNING HE IS
A WORTHY DISCIPLE OF PLATO
LIKE HIM STARTING FROM A SMALL PORTION
OF FACT HE FOUNDS HIS TALE WITH ADMIRABLE SKILL ON A FEW LINES IN THE
LATIN NARRATIVE OF THE VOYAGES OF AMERIGO VESPUCCI
HE IS VERY PRECISE
ABOUT DATES AND FACTS AND HAS THE POWER OF MAKING US BELIEVE THAT THE
NARRATOR OF THE TALE MUST HAVE BEEN AN EYEWITNESS
WE ARE FAIRLY PUZZLED
BY HIS MANNER OF MIXING UP REAL AND IMAGINARY PERSONS HIS BOY JOHN
CLEMENT AND PETER GILES CITIZEN OF ANTWERP WITH WHOM HE DISPUTES
ABOUT THE PRECISE WORDS WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN USED BY THE
IMAGINARY PORTUGUESE TRAVELLER RAPHAEL HYTHLODAY
'I HAVE THE MORE
CAUSE SAYS HYTHLODAY 'TO FEAR THAT MY WORDS SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED
FOR THAT I KNOW HOW DIFFICULTLY AND HARDLY I MYSELF WOULD HAVE BELIEVED
ANOTHER MAN TELLING THE SAME IF I HAD NOT MYSELF SEEN IT WITH MINE OWN
EYES OR AGAIN 'IF YOU HAD BEEN WITH ME IN UTOPIA AND HAD PRESENTLY
SEEN THEIR FASHIONS AND LAWS AS I DID WHICH LIVED THERE FIVE YEARS AND
MORE AND WOULD NEVER HAVE COME THENCE BUT ONLY TO MAKE THE NEW LAND
KNOWN HERE ETC
MORE GREATLY REGRETS THAT HE FORGOT TO ASK HYTHLODAY
IN WHAT PART OF THE WORLD UTOPIA IS SITUATED HE 'WOULD HAVE SPENT NO
SMALL SUM OF MONEY RATHER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE ESCAPED HIM AND HE BEGS
PETER GILES TO SEE HYTHLODAY OR WRITE TO HIM AND OBTAIN AN ANSWER TO THE
QUESTION
AFTER THIS WE ARE NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT A PROFESSOR OF
DIVINITY PERHAPS 'A LATE FAMOUS VICAR OF CROYDON IN SURREY AS THE
TRANSLATOR THINKS IS DESIROUS OF BEING SENT THITHER AS A MISSIONARY BY
THE HIGH BISHOP 'YEA AND THAT HE MAY HIMSELF BE MADE BISHOP OF UTOPIA
NOTHING DOUBTING THAT HE MUST OBTAIN THIS BISHOPRIC WITH SUIT AND HE
COUNTETH THAT A GODLY SUIT WHICH PROCEEDETH NOT OF THE DESIRE OF HONOUR
OR LUCRE BUT ONLY OF A GODLY ZEAL THE DESIGN MAY HAVE FAILED THROUGH
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HYTHLODAY CONCERNING WHOM WE HAVE 'VERY UNCERTAIN
NEWS' AFTER HIS DEPARTURE
THERE IS NO DOUBT HOWEVER THAT HE HAD TOLD
MORE AND GILES THE EXACT SITUATION OF THE ISLAND BUT UNFORTUNATELY AT
THE SAME MOMENT MORE'S ATTENTION AS HE IS REMINDED IN A LETTER FROM
GILES WAS DRAWN OFF BY A SERVANT AND ONE OF THE COMPANY FROM A COLD
CAUGHT ON SHIPBOARD COUGHED SO LOUD AS TO PREVENT GILES FROM HEARING
AND 'THE SECRET HAS PERISHED' WITH HIM TO THIS DAY THE PLACE OF UTOPIA
REMAINS UNKNOWN
THE WORDS OF PHAEDRUS 'O SOCRATES YOU CAN EASILY INVENT EGYPTIANS OR
ANYTHING ARE RECALLED TO OUR MIND AS WE READ THIS LIFELIKE FICTION
YET THE GREATER MERIT OF THE WORK IS NOT THE ADMIRABLE ART BUT THE
ORIGINALITY OF THOUGHT
MORE IS AS FREE AS PLATO FROM THE PREJUDICES
OF HIS AGE AND FAR MORE TOLERANT
THE UTOPIANS DO NOT ALLOW HIM
WHO BELIEVES NOT IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL TO SHARE IN THE
ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE LAWS 'HOWBEIT THEY PUT HIM TO NO
PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY BE PERSUADED THAT IT IS IN NO MAN'S POWER TO
BELIEVE WHAT HE LIST' AND 'NO MAN IS TO BE BLAMED FOR REASONING IN
SUPPORT OF HIS OWN RELIGION 'ONE OF OUR COMPANY IN MY PRESENCE WAS
SHARPLY PUNISHED
HE AS SOON AS HE WAS BAPTISED BEGAN AGAINST OUR
WILLS WITH MORE EARNEST AFFECTION THAN WISDOM TO REASON OF CHRIST'S
RELIGION AND BEGAN TO WAX SO HOT IN HIS MATTER THAT HE DID NOT ONLY
PREFER OUR RELIGION BEFORE ALL OTHER BUT ALSO DID DESPISE AND CONDEMN
ALL OTHER CALLING THEM PROFANE AND THE FOLLOWERS OF THEM WICKED AND
DEVILISH AND THE CHILDREN OF EVERLASTING DAMNATION
WHEN HE HAD THUS
LONG REASONED THE MATTER THEY LAID HOLD ON HIM ACCUSED HIM AND
CONDEMNED HIM INTO EXILE NOT AS A DESPISER OF RELIGION BUT AS A
SEDITIOUS PERSON AND A RAISER UP OF DISSENSION AMONG THE PEOPLE'
IN THE PUBLIC SERVICES 'NO PRAYERS BE USED BUT SUCH AS EVERY MAN
MAY BOLDLY PRONOUNCE WITHOUT GIVING OFFENCE TO ANY SECT HE SAYS
SIGNIFICANTLY 'THERE BE THAT GIVE WORSHIP TO A MAN THAT WAS ONCE OF
EXCELLENT VIRTUE OR OF FAMOUS GLORY NOT ONLY AS GOD BUT ALSO THE
CHIEFEST AND HIGHEST GOD
BUT THE MOST AND THE WISEST PART REJECTING
ALL THESE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN GODLY POWER UNKNOWN FAR
ABOVE THE CAPACITY AND REACH OF MAN'S WIT DISPERSED THROUGHOUT ALL THE
WORLD NOT IN BIGNESS BUT IN VIRTUE AND POWER
HIM THEY CALL THE FATHER
OF ALL
TO HIM ALONE THEY ATTRIBUTE THE BEGINNINGS THE INCREASINGS THE
PROCEEDINGS THE CHANGES AND THE ENDS OF ALL THINGS
NEITHER GIVE THEY
ANY DIVINE HONOURS TO ANY OTHER THAN HIM SO FAR WAS MORE FROM SHARING
THE POPULAR BELIEFS OF HIS TIME
YET AT THE END HE REMINDS US THAT HE
DOES NOT IN ALL RESPECTS AGREE WITH THE CUSTOMS AND OPINIONS OF THE
UTOPIANS WHICH HE DESCRIBES
AND WE SHOULD LET HIM HAVE THE BENEFIT OF
THIS SAVING CLAUSE AND NOT RUDELY WITHDRAW THE VEIL BEHIND WHICH HE HAS
BEEN PLEASED TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
NOR IS HE LESS IN ADVANCE OF POPULAR OPINION IN HIS POLITICAL AND MORAL
SPECULATIONS
HE WOULD LIKE TO BRING MILITARY GLORY INTO CONTEMPT HE
WOULD SET ALL SORTS OF IDLE PEOPLE TO PROFITABLE OCCUPATION INCLUDING
IN THE SAME CLASS PRIESTS WOMEN NOBLEMEN GENTLEMEN AND 'STURDY AND
VALIANT BEGGARS THAT THE LABOUR OF ALL MAY BE REDUCED TO SIX HOURS A
DAY
HIS DISLIKE OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AND PLANS FOR THE REFORMATION OF
OFFENDERS HIS DETESTATION OF PRIESTS AND LAWYERS COMPARE HIS SATIRICAL
OBSERVATION 'THEY THE UTOPIANS HAVE PRIESTS OF EXCEEDING HOLINESS
AND THEREFORE VERY FEW HIS REMARK THAT 'ALTHOUGH EVERY ONE MAY HEAR
OF RAVENOUS DOGS AND WOLVES AND CRUEL MAN EATERS IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND
STATES THAT ARE WELL AND WISELY GOVERNED ARE CURIOUSLY AT VARIANCE
WITH THE NOTIONS OF HIS AGE AND INDEED WITH HIS OWN LIFE
THERE ARE MANY
POINTS IN WHICH HE SHOWS A MODERN FEELING AND A PROPHETIC INSIGHT LIKE
PLATO
HE IS A SANITARY REFORMER HE MAINTAINS THAT CIVILIZED STATES
HAVE A RIGHT TO THE SOIL OF WASTE COUNTRIES HE IS INCLINED TO THE
OPINION WHICH PLACES HAPPINESS IN VIRTUOUS PLEASURES BUT HEREIN AS HE
THINKS NOT DISAGREEING FROM THOSE OTHER PHILOSOPHERS WHO DEFINE VIRTUE
TO BE A LIFE ACCORDING TO NATURE
HE EXTENDS THE IDEA OF HAPPINESS SO AS
TO INCLUDE THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS AND HE ARGUES INGENIOUSLY 'ALL MEN
AGREE THAT WE OUGHT TO MAKE OTHERS HAPPY BUT IF OTHERS HOW MUCH MORE
OURSELVES AND STILL HE THINKS THAT THERE MAY BE A MORE EXCELLENT WAY
BUT TO THIS NO MAN'S REASON CAN ATTAIN UNLESS HEAVEN SHOULD INSPIRE HIM
WITH A HIGHER TRUTH
HIS CEREMONIES BEFORE MARRIAGE HIS HUMANE PROPOSAL
THAT WAR SHOULD BE CARRIED ON BY ASSASSINATING THE LEADERS OF THE ENEMY
MAY BE COMPARED TO SOME OF THE PARADOXES OF PLATO
HE HAS A CHARMING
FANCY LIKE THE AFFINITIES OF GREEKS AND BARBARIANS IN THE TIMAEUS THAT
THE UTOPIANS LEARNT THE LANGUAGE OF THE GREEKS WITH THE MORE READINESS
BECAUSE THEY WERE ORIGINALLY OF THE SAME RACE WITH THEM
HE IS
PENETRATED WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO AND QUOTES OR ADAPTS MANY THOUGHTS
BOTH FROM THE REPUBLIC AND FROM THE TIMAEUS
HE PREFERS PUBLIC DUTIES TO
PRIVATE AND IS SOMEWHAT IMPATIENT OF THE IMPORTUNITY OF RELATIONS
HIS
CITIZENS HAVE NO SILVER OR GOLD OF THEIR OWN BUT ARE READY ENOUGH TO
PAY THEM TO THEIR MERCENARIES
THERE IS NOTHING OF WHICH HE IS MORE
CONTEMPTUOUS THAN THE LOVE OF MONEY
GOLD IS USED FOR FETTERS OF
CRIMINALS AND DIAMONDS AND PEARLS FOR CHILDREN'S NECKLACES WHEN THE
AMBASSADORS CAME ARRAYED IN GOLD AND PEACOCKS' FEATHERS 'TO THE EYES OF
ALL THE UTOPIANS EXCEPT VERY FEW WHICH HAD BEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES FOR
SOME REASONABLE CAUSE ALL THAT GORGEOUSNESS OF APPAREL SEEMED SHAMEFUL
AND REPROACHFUL
IN SO MUCH THAT THEY MOST REVERENTLY SALUTED THE
VILEST AND MOST ABJECT OF THEM FOR LORDS PASSING OVER THE AMBASSADORS
THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY HONOUR JUDGING THEM BY THEIR WEARING OF GOLDEN
CHAINS TO BE BONDMEN
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN CHILDREN ALSO THAT HAD CAST
AWAY THEIR PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES WHEN THEY SAW THE LIKE STICKING
UPON THE AMBASSADORS' CAPS DIG AND PUSH THEIR MOTHERS UNDER THE SIDES
SAYING THUS TO THEM LOOK THOUGH HE WERE A LITTLE CHILD STILL BUT
THE MOTHER YEA AND THAT ALSO IN GOOD EARNEST PEACE SON SAITH SHE
I THINK HE BE SOME OF THE AMBASSADORS' FOOLS
LIKE PLATO HE IS FULL OF SATIRICAL REFLECTIONS ON GOVERNMENTS AND
PRINCES ON THE STATE OF THE WORLD AND OF KNOWLEDGE
THE HERO OF HIS
DISCOURSE HYTHLODAY IS VERY UNWILLING TO BECOME A MINISTER OF STATE
CONSIDERING THAT HE WOULD LOSE HIS INDEPENDENCE AND HIS ADVICE WOULD
NEVER BE HEEDED COMPARE AN EXQUISITE PASSAGE OF WHICH THE CONCLUSION
IS AS FOLLOWS 'AND VERILY IT IS NATURALLY GIVEN SUPPRESSED AND
ENDED HE RIDICULES THE NEW LOGIC OF HIS TIME THE UTOPIANS COULD
NEVER BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THE DOCTRINE OF SECOND INTENTIONS 'FOR THEY
HAVE NOT DEVISED ONE OF ALL THOSE RULES OF RESTRICTIONS AMPLIFICATIONS
AND SUPPOSITIONS VERY WITTILY INVENTED IN THE SMALL LOGICALS WHICH
HERE OUR CHILDREN IN EVERY PLACE DO LEARN
FURTHERMORE THEY WERE NEVER
YET ABLE TO FIND OUT THE SECOND INTENTIONS INSOMUCH THAT NONE OF THEM
ALL COULD EVER SEE MAN HIMSELF IN COMMON AS THEY CALL HIM THOUGH HE BE
AS YOU KNOW BIGGER THAN WAS EVER ANY GIANT YEA AND POINTED TO OF US
EVEN WITH OUR FINGER HE IS VERY SEVERE ON THE SPORTS OF THE GENTRY
THE UTOPIANS COUNT 'HUNTING THE LOWEST THE VILEST AND THE MOST ABJECT
PART OF BUTCHERY HE QUOTES THE WORDS OF THE REPUBLIC IN WHICH THE
PHILOSOPHER IS DESCRIBED 'STANDING OUT OF THE WAY UNDER A WALL UNTIL THE
DRIVING STORM OF SLEET AND RAIN BE OVERPAST WHICH ADMIT OF A SINGULAR
APPLICATION TO MORE'S OWN FATE ALTHOUGH WRITING TWENTY YEARS BEFORE
ABOUT THE YEAR 1514 HE CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE FORESEEN THIS
THERE IS NO TOUCH OF SATIRE WHICH STRIKES DEEPER THAN HIS QUIET REMARK
THAT THE GREATER PART OF THE PRECEPTS OF CHRIST ARE MORE AT VARIANCE
WITH THE LIVES OF ORDINARY CHRISTIANS THAN THE DISCOURSE OF UTOPIA 'AND
YET THE MOST PART OF THEM IS MORE DISSIDENT FROM THE MANNERS OF THE
WORLD NOW A DAYS THAN MY COMMUNICATION WAS
BUT PREACHERS SLY AND
WILY MEN FOLLOWING YOUR COUNSEL AS I SUPPOSE BECAUSE THEY SAW MEN
EVIL WILLING TO FRAME THEIR MANNERS TO CHRIST'S RULE THEY HAVE WRESTED
AND WRIED HIS DOCTRINE AND LIKE A RULE OF LEAD HAVE APPLIED IT TO
MEN'S MANNERS THAT BY SOME MEANS AT THE LEAST WAY THEY MIGHT AGREE
TOGETHER
THE 'NEW ATLANTIS' IS ONLY A FRAGMENT AND FAR INFERIOR IN MERIT TO THE
'UTOPIA THE WORK IS FULL OF INGENUITY BUT WANTING IN CREATIVE FANCY
AND BY NO MEANS IMPRESSES THE READER WITH A SENSE OF CREDIBILITY
IN
SOME PLACES LORD BACON IS CHARACTERISTICALLY DIFFERENT FROM SIR THOMAS
MORE AS FOR EXAMPLE IN THE EXTERNAL STATE WHICH HE ATTRIBUTES TO THE
GOVERNOR OF SOLOMON'S HOUSE WHOSE DRESS HE MINUTELY DESCRIBES WHILE TO
SIR THOMAS MORE SUCH TRAPPINGS APPEAR SIMPLE RIDICULOUS
YET AFTER THIS
PROGRAMME OF DRESS BACON ADDS THE BEAUTIFUL TRAIT 'THAT HE HAD A LOOK
AS THOUGH HE PITIED MEN SEVERAL THINGS ARE BORROWED BY HIM FROM THE
TIMAEUS BUT HE HAS INJURED THE UNITY OF STYLE BY ADDING THOUGHTS AND
PASSAGES WHICH ARE TAKEN FROM THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES
THE 'CITY OF THE SUN' WRITTEN BY CAMPANELLA 1568 1639 A DOMINICAN
FRIAR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE 'NEW ATLANTIS' OF BACON HAS MANY
RESEMBLANCES TO THE REPUBLIC OF PLATO
THE CITIZENS HAVE WIVES AND
CHILDREN IN COMMON THEIR MARRIAGES ARE OF THE SAME TEMPORARY SORT AND
ARE ARRANGED BY THE MAGISTRATES FROM TIME TO TIME
THEY DO NOT HOWEVER
ADOPT HIS SYSTEM OF LOTS BUT BRING TOGETHER THE BEST NATURES MALE AND
FEMALE 'ACCORDING TO PHILOSOPHICAL RULES THE INFANTS UNTIL TWO YEARS
OF AGE ARE BROUGHT UP BY THEIR MOTHERS IN PUBLIC TEMPLES AND SINCE
INDIVIDUALS FOR THE MOST PART EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN BADLY AT THE
BEGINNING OF THEIR THIRD YEAR THEY ARE COMMITTED TO THE CARE OF THE
STATE AND ARE TAUGHT AT FIRST NOT OUT OF BOOKS BUT FROM PAINTINGS OF
ALL KINDS WHICH ARE EMBLAZONED ON THE WALLS OF THE CITY
THE CITY HAS
SIX INTERIOR CIRCUITS OF WALLS AND AN OUTER WALL WHICH IS THE
SEVENTH
ON THIS OUTER WALL ARE PAINTED THE FIGURES OF LEGISLATORS AND
PHILOSOPHERS AND ON EACH OF THE INTERIOR WALLS THE SYMBOLS OR FORMS
OF SOME ONE OF THE SCIENCES ARE DELINEATED
THE WOMEN ARE FOR THE MOST
PART TRAINED LIKE THE MEN IN WARLIKE AND OTHER EXERCISES BUT THEY
HAVE TWO SPECIAL OCCUPATIONS OF THEIR OWN
AFTER A BATTLE THEY AND THE
BOYS SOOTHE AND RELIEVE THE WOUNDED WARRIORS ALSO THEY ENCOURAGE THEM
WITH EMBRACES AND PLEASANT WORDS
SOME ELEMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN OR
CATHOLIC RELIGION ARE PRESERVED AMONG THEM
THE LIFE OF THE APOSTLES IS
GREATLY ADMIRED BY THIS PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL THINGS IN COMMON
AND THE SHORT PRAYER WHICH JESUS CHRIST TAUGHT MEN IS USED IN THEIR
WORSHIP
IT IS A DUTY OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATES TO PARDON SINS AND
THEREFORE THE WHOLE PEOPLE MAKE SECRET CONFESSION OF THEM TO THE
MAGISTRATES AND THEY TO THEIR CHIEF WHO IS A SORT OF RECTOR
METAPHYSICUS AND BY THIS MEANS HE IS WELL INFORMED OF ALL THAT IS GOING
ON IN THE MINDS OF MEN
AFTER CONFESSION ABSOLUTION IS GRANTED TO
THE CITIZENS COLLECTIVELY BUT NO ONE IS MENTIONED BY NAME
THERE
ALSO EXISTS AMONG THEM A PRACTICE OF PERPETUAL PRAYER PERFORMED BY
A SUCCESSION OF PRIESTS WHO CHANGE EVERY HOUR
THEIR RELIGION IS
A WORSHIP OF GOD IN TRINITY THAT IS OF WISDOM LOVE AND POWER
BUT WITHOUT ANY DISTINCTION OF PERSONS
THEY BEHOLD IN THE SUN THE
REFLECTION OF HIS GLORY MERE GRAVEN IMAGES THEY REJECT REFUSING TO
FALL UNDER THE 'TYRANNY' OF IDOLATRY
MANY DETAILS ARE GIVEN ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMS OF EATING AND DRINKING ABOUT
THEIR MODE OF DRESSING THEIR EMPLOYMENTS THEIR WARS
CAMPANELLA LOOKS
FORWARD TO A NEW MODE OF EDUCATION WHICH IS TO BE A STUDY OF NATURE
AND NOT OF ARISTOTLE
HE WOULD NOT HAVE HIS CITIZENS WASTE THEIR TIME
IN THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT HE CALLS 'THE DEAD SIGNS OF THINGS HE
REMARKS THAT HE WHO KNOWS ONE SCIENCE ONLY DOES NOT REALLY KNOW THAT
ONE ANY MORE THAN THE REST AND INSISTS STRONGLY ON THE NECESSITY OF A
VARIETY OF KNOWLEDGE
MORE SCHOLARS ARE TURNED OUT IN THE CITY OF THE
SUN IN ONE YEAR THAN BY CONTEMPORARY METHODS IN TEN OR FIFTEEN
HE
EVIDENTLY BELIEVES LIKE BACON THAT HENCEFORWARD NATURAL SCIENCE WILL
PLAY A GREAT PART IN EDUCATION A HOPE WHICH SEEMS HARDLY TO HAVE
BEEN REALIZED EITHER IN OUR OWN OR IN ANY FORMER AGE AT ANY RATE THE
FULFILMENT OF IT HAS BEEN LONG DEFERRED
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF INGENUITY AND EVEN ORIGINALITY IN THIS WORK AND
A MOST ENLIGHTENED SPIRIT PERVADES IT
BUT IT HAS LITTLE OR NO CHARM
OF STYLE AND FALLS VERY FAR SHORT OF THE 'NEW ATLANTIS' OF BACON
AND STILL MORE OF THE 'UTOPIA' OF SIR THOMAS MORE
IT IS FULL OF
INCONSISTENCIES AND THOUGH BORROWED FROM PLATO SHOWS BUT A SUPERFICIAL
ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS WRITINGS
IT IS A WORK SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT
TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A PHILOSOPHER AND MAN OF GENIUS WHO WAS ALSO A
FRIAR AND WHO HAD SPENT TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE IN A PRISON OF
THE INQUISITION
THE MOST INTERESTING FEATURE OF THE BOOK COMMON TO
PLATO AND SIR THOMAS MORE IS THE DEEP FEELING WHICH IS SHOWN BY THE
WRITER OF THE MISERY AND IGNORANCE PREVAILING AMONG THE LOWER CLASSES
IN HIS OWN TIME
CAMPANELLA TAKES NOTE OF ARISTOTLE'S ANSWER TO PLATO'S
COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY THAT IN A SOCIETY WHERE ALL THINGS ARE COMMON NO
INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE ANY MOTIVE TO WORK ARIST
POL HE REPLIES THAT
HIS CITIZENS BEING HAPPY AND CONTENTED IN THEMSELVES THEY ARE REQUIRED
TO WORK ONLY FOUR HOURS A DAY WILL HAVE GREATER REGARD FOR THEIR
FELLOWS THAN EXISTS AMONG MEN AT PRESENT
HE THINKS LIKE PLATO THAT IF
HE ABOLISHES PRIVATE FEELINGS AND INTERESTS A GREAT PUBLIC FEELING WILL
TAKE THEIR PLACE
OTHER WRITINGS ON IDEAL STATES SUCH AS THE 'OCEANA' OF HARRINGTON IN
WHICH THE LORD ARCHON MEANING CROMWELL IS DESCRIBED NOT AS HE WAS
BUT AS HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN OR THE 'ARGENIS' OF BARCLAY WHICH IS AN
HISTORICAL ALLEGORY OF HIS OWN TIME ARE TOO UNLIKE PLATO TO BE WORTH
MENTIONING
MORE INTERESTING THAN EITHER OF THESE AND FAR MORE PLATONIC
IN STYLE AND THOUGHT IS SIR JOHN ELIOT'S 'MONARCHY OF MAN IN WHICH
THE PRISONER OF THE TOWER NO LONGER ABLE 'TO BE A POLITICIAN IN THE
LAND OF HIS BIRTH TURNS AWAY FROM POLITICS TO VIEW 'THAT OTHER CITY
WHICH IS WITHIN HIM AND FINDS ON THE VERY THRESHOLD OF THE GRAVE THAT
THE SECRET OF HUMAN HAPPINESS IS THE MASTERY OF SELF
THE CHANGE OF
GOVERNMENT IN THE TIME OF THE ENGLISH COMMONWEALTH SET MEN THINKING
ABOUT FIRST PRINCIPLES AND GAVE RISE TO MANY WORKS OF THIS CLASS THE
GREAT ORIGINAL GENIUS OF SWIFT OWES NOTHING TO PLATO NOR IS THERE
ANY TRACE IN THE CONVERSATION OR IN THE WORKS OF DR
JOHNSON OF ANY
ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS WRITINGS
HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE REFUTED PLATO
WITHOUT READING HIM IN THE SAME FASHION IN WHICH HE SUPPOSED HIMSELF TO
HAVE REFUTED BISHOP BERKELEY'S THEORY OF THE NON EXISTENCE OF MATTER
IF WE EXCEPT THE SO CALLED ENGLISH PLATONISTS OR RATHER NEO PLATONISTS
WHO NEVER UNDERSTOOD THEIR MASTER AND THE WRITINGS OF COLERIDGE
WHO WAS TO SOME EXTENT A KINDRED SPIRIT PLATO HAS LEFT NO PERMANENT
IMPRESSION ON ENGLISH LITERATURE
7
HUMAN LIFE AND CONDUCT ARE AFFECTED BY IDEALS IN THE SAME WAY THAT
THEY ARE AFFECTED BY THE EXAMPLES OF EMINENT MEN
NEITHER THE ONE NOR
THE OTHER ARE IMMEDIATELY APPLICABLE TO PRACTICE BUT THERE IS A VIRTUE
FLOWING FROM THEM WHICH TENDS TO RAISE INDIVIDUALS ABOVE THE COMMON
ROUTINE OF SOCIETY OR TRADE AND TO ELEVATE STATES ABOVE THE MERE
INTERESTS OF COMMERCE OR THE NECESSITIES OF SELF DEFENCE
LIKE THE
IDEALS OF ART THEY ARE PARTLY FRAMED BY THE OMISSION OF PARTICULARS
THEY REQUIRE TO BE VIEWED AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND ARE APT TO FADE
AWAY IF WE ATTEMPT TO APPROACH THEM
THEY GAIN AN IMAGINARY DISTINCTNESS
WHEN EMBODIED IN A STATE OR IN A SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHY BUT THEY STILL
REMAIN THE VISIONS OF 'A WORLD UNREALIZED MORE STRIKING AND OBVIOUS TO
THE ORDINARY MIND ARE THE EXAMPLES OF GREAT MEN WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR
OWN GENERATION AND ARE REMEMBERED IN ANOTHER
EVEN IN OUR OWN FAMILY
CIRCLE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME ONE A WOMAN OR EVEN A CHILD IN
WHOSE FACE HAS SHONE FORTH A GOODNESS MORE THAN HUMAN
THE IDEAL THEN
APPROACHES NEARER TO US AND WE FONDLY CLING TO IT
THE IDEAL OF THE
PAST WHETHER OF OUR OWN PAST LIVES OR OF FORMER STATES OF SOCIETY HAS
A SINGULAR FASCINATION FOR THE MINDS OF MANY
TOO LATE WE LEARN THAT
SUCH IDEALS CANNOT BE RECALLED THOUGH THE RECOLLECTION OF THEM MAY
HAVE A HUMANIZING INFLUENCE ON OTHER TIMES
BUT THE ABSTRACTIONS OF
PHILOSOPHY ARE TO MOST PERSONS COLD AND VACANT THEY GIVE LIGHT WITHOUT
WARMTH THEY ARE LIKE THE FULL MOON IN THE HEAVENS WHEN THERE ARE NO
STARS APPEARING
MEN CANNOT LIVE BY THOUGHT ALONE THE WORLD OF SENSE IS
ALWAYS BREAKING IN UPON THEM
THEY ARE FOR THE MOST PART CONFINED TO A
CORNER OF EARTH AND SEE BUT A LITTLE WAY BEYOND THEIR OWN HOME OR PLACE
OF ABODE THEY 'DO NOT LIFT UP THEIR EYES TO THE HILLS' THEY ARE NOT
AWAKE WHEN THE DAWN APPEARS
BUT IN PLATO WE HAVE REACHED A HEIGHT FROM
WHICH A MAN MAY LOOK INTO THE DISTANCE AND BEHOLD THE FUTURE OF THE
WORLD AND OF PHILOSOPHY
THE IDEAL OF THE STATE AND OF THE LIFE OF
THE PHILOSOPHER THE IDEAL OF AN EDUCATION CONTINUING THROUGH LIFE AND
EXTENDING EQUALLY TO BOTH SEXES THE IDEAL OF THE UNITY AND CORRELATION
OF KNOWLEDGE THE FAITH IN GOOD AND IMMORTALITY ARE THE VACANT FORMS OF
LIGHT ON WHICH PLATO IS SEEKING TO FIX THE EYE OF MANKIND
8
TWO OTHER IDEALS WHICH NEVER APPEARED ABOVE THE HORIZON IN GREEK
PHILOSOPHY FLOAT BEFORE THE MINDS OF MEN IN OUR OWN DAY ONE SEEN MORE
CLEARLY THAN FORMERLY AS THOUGH EACH YEAR AND EACH GENERATION BROUGHT
US NEARER TO SOME GREAT CHANGE THE OTHER ALMOST IN THE SAME DEGREE
RETIRING FROM VIEW BEHIND THE LAWS OF NATURE AS IF OPPRESSED BY THEM
BUT STILL REMAINING A SILENT HOPE OF WE KNOW NOT WHAT HIDDEN IN THE
HEART OF MAN
THE FIRST IDEAL IS THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE IN THIS
WORLD THE SECOND THE FUTURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN ANOTHER
THE FIRST IS
THE MORE PERFECT REALIZATION OF OUR OWN PRESENT LIFE THE SECOND
THE ABNEGATION OF IT THE ONE LIMITED BY EXPERIENCE THE OTHER
TRANSCENDING IT
BOTH OF THEM HAVE BEEN AND ARE POWERFUL MOTIVES OF
ACTION THERE ARE A FEW IN WHOM THEY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF ALL EARTHLY
INTERESTS
THE HOPE OF A FUTURE FOR THE HUMAN RACE AT FIRST SIGHT SEEMS
TO BE THE MORE DISINTERESTED THE HOPE OF INDIVIDUAL EXISTENCE THE MORE
EGOTISTICAL OF THE TWO MOTIVES
BUT WHEN MEN HAVE LEARNED TO RESOLVE
THEIR HOPE OF A FUTURE EITHER FOR THEMSELVES OR FOR THE WORLD INTO THE
WILL OF GOD 'NOT MY WILL BUT THINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM FALLS
AWAY AND THEY MAY BE ALLOWED TO MAKE EITHER OF THEM THE BASIS OF THEIR
LIVES ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTER OR TEMPERAMENT
THERE
IS AS MUCH FAITH IN THE WILLINGNESS TO WORK FOR AN UNSEEN FUTURE IN THIS
WORLD AS IN ANOTHER
NEITHER IS IT INCONCEIVABLE THAT SOME RARE NATURE
MAY FEEL HIS DUTY TO ANOTHER GENERATION OR TO ANOTHER CENTURY ALMOST
AS STRONGLY AS TO HIS OWN OR THAT LIVING ALWAYS IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD
HE MAY REALIZE ANOTHER WORLD AS VIVIDLY AS HE DOES THIS
THE GREATEST OF ALL IDEALS MAY OR RATHER MUST BE CONCEIVED BY US UNDER
SIMILITUDES DERIVED FROM HUMAN QUALITIES ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES LIKE THE
JEWISH PROPHETS WE MAY DASH AWAY THESE FIGURES OF SPEECH AND DESCRIBE
THE NATURE OF GOD ONLY IN NEGATIVES
THESE AGAIN BY DEGREES ACQUIRE A
POSITIVE MEANING
IT WOULD BE WELL IF WHEN MEDITATING ON THE HIGHER
TRUTHS EITHER OF PHILOSOPHY OR RELIGION WE SOMETIMES SUBSTITUTED ONE
FORM OF EXPRESSION FOR ANOTHER LEST THROUGH THE NECESSITIES OF LANGUAGE
WE SHOULD BECOME THE SLAVES OF MERE WORDS
THERE IS A THIRD IDEAL NOT THE SAME BUT AKIN TO THESE WHICH HAS A
PLACE IN THE HOME AND HEART OF EVERY BELIEVER IN THE RELIGION OF CHRIST
AND IN WHICH MEN SEEM TO FIND A NEARER AND MORE FAMILIAR TRUTH
THE DIVINE MAN THE SON OF MAN THE SAVIOUR OF MANKIND WHO IS THE
FIRST BORN AND HEAD OF THE WHOLE FAMILY IN HEAVEN AND EARTH IN WHOM
THE DIVINE AND HUMAN THAT WHICH IS WITHOUT AND THAT WHICH IS WITHIN THE
RANGE OF OUR EARTHLY FACULTIES ARE INDISSOLUBLY UNITED
NEITHER IS THIS
DIVINE FORM OF GOODNESS WHOLLY SEPARABLE FROM THE IDEAL OF THE CHRISTIAN
CHURCH WHICH IS SAID IN THE NEW TESTAMENT TO BE 'HIS BODY OR AT
VARIANCE WITH THOSE OTHER IMAGES OF GOOD WHICH PLATO SETS BEFORE US
WE
SEE HIM IN A FIGURE ONLY AND OF FIGURES OF SPEECH WE SELECT BUT A FEW
AND THOSE THE SIMPLEST TO BE THE EXPRESSION OF HIM
WE BEHOLD HIM IN
A PICTURE BUT HE IS NOT THERE
WE GATHER UP THE FRAGMENTS OF HIS
DISCOURSES BUT NEITHER DO THEY REPRESENT HIM AS HE TRULY WAS
HIS
DWELLING IS NEITHER IN HEAVEN NOR EARTH BUT IN THE HEART OF MAN
THIS IS THAT IMAGE WHICH PLATO SAW DIMLY IN THE DISTANCE WHICH WHEN
EXISTING AMONG MEN HE CALLED IN THE LANGUAGE OF HOMER 'THE LIKENESS
OF GOD THE LIKENESS OF A NATURE WHICH IN ALL AGES MEN HAVE FELT TO BE
GREATER AND BETTER THAN THEMSELVES AND WHICH IN ENDLESS FORMS WHETHER
DERIVED FROM SCRIPTURE OR NATURE FROM THE WITNESS OF HISTORY OR FROM
THE HUMAN HEART REGARDED AS A PERSON OR NOT AS A PERSON WITH OR
WITHOUT PARTS OR PASSIONS EXISTING IN SPACE OR NOT IN SPACE IS AND
WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO BE TO MANKIND THE IDEA OF GOOD
THE REPUBLIC
PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE
SOCRATES WHO IS THE NARRATOR
GLAUCON
ADEIMANTUS
POLEMARCHUS
CEPHALUS
THRASYMACHUS
CLEITOPHON
AND OTHERS WHO ARE MUTE AUDITORS
THE SCENE IS LAID IN THE HOUSE OF CEPHALUS AT THE PIRAEUS AND THE WHOLE
DIALOGUE IS NARRATED BY SOCRATES THE DAY AFTER IT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE TO
TIMAEUS HERMOCRATES CRITIAS AND A NAMELESS PERSON WHO ARE INTRODUCED
IN THE TIMAEUS
BOOK I
I WENT DOWN YESTERDAY TO THE PIRAEUS WITH GLAUCON THE SON OF ARISTON
THAT I MIGHT OFFER UP MY PRAYERS TO THE GODDESS BENDIS THE THRACIAN
ARTEMIS AND ALSO BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE IN WHAT MANNER THEY WOULD
CELEBRATE THE FESTIVAL WHICH WAS A NEW THING
I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE
PROCESSION OF THE INHABITANTS BUT THAT OF THE THRACIANS WAS EQUALLY
IF NOT MORE BEAUTIFUL
WHEN WE HAD FINISHED OUR PRAYERS AND VIEWED THE
SPECTACLE WE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY AND AT THAT INSTANT
POLEMARCHUS THE SON OF CEPHALUS CHANCED TO CATCH SIGHT OF US FROM A
DISTANCE AS WE WERE STARTING ON OUR WAY HOME AND TOLD HIS SERVANT TO
RUN AND BID US WAIT FOR HIM
THE SERVANT TOOK HOLD OF ME BY THE CLOAK
BEHIND AND SAID POLEMARCHUS DESIRES YOU TO WAIT
I TURNED ROUND AND ASKED HIM WHERE HIS MASTER WAS
THERE HE IS SAID THE YOUTH COMING AFTER YOU IF YOU WILL ONLY WAIT
CERTAINLY WE WILL SAID GLAUCON AND IN A FEW MINUTES POLEMARCHUS
APPEARED AND WITH HIM ADEIMANTUS GLAUCON'S BROTHER NICERATUS THE SON
OF NICIAS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN AT THE PROCESSION
POLEMARCHUS SAID TO ME I PERCEIVE SOCRATES THAT YOU AND YOUR
COMPANION ARE ALREADY ON YOUR WAY TO THE CITY
YOU ARE NOT FAR WRONG I SAID
BUT DO YOU SEE HE REJOINED HOW MANY WE ARE
OF COURSE
AND ARE YOU STRONGER THAN ALL THESE FOR IF NOT YOU WILL HAVE TO REMAIN
WHERE YOU ARE
MAY THERE NOT BE THE ALTERNATIVE I SAID THAT WE MAY PERSUADE YOU TO
LET US GO
BUT CAN YOU PERSUADE US IF WE REFUSE TO LISTEN TO YOU HE SAID
CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED GLAUCON
THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO LISTEN OF THAT YOU MAY BE ASSURED
ADEIMANTUS ADDED HAS NO ONE TOLD YOU OF THE TORCH RACE ON HORSEBACK IN
HONOUR OF THE GODDESS WHICH WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE EVENING
WITH HORSES I REPLIED THAT IS A NOVELTY
WILL HORSEMEN CARRY TORCHES
AND PASS THEM ONE TO ANOTHER DURING THE RACE
YES SAID POLEMARCHUS AND NOT ONLY SO BUT A FESTIVAL WILL BE
CELEBRATED AT NIGHT WHICH YOU CERTAINLY OUGHT TO SEE
LET US RISE SOON
AFTER SUPPER AND SEE THIS FESTIVAL THERE WILL BE A GATHERING OF YOUNG
MEN AND WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TALK
STAY THEN AND DO NOT BE PERVERSE
GLAUCON SAID I SUPPOSE SINCE YOU INSIST THAT WE MUST
VERY GOOD I REPLIED
ACCORDINGLY WE WENT WITH POLEMARCHUS TO HIS HOUSE AND THERE WE FOUND
HIS BROTHERS LYSIAS AND EUTHYDEMUS AND WITH THEM THRASYMACHUS THE
CHALCEDONIAN CHARMANTIDES THE PAEANIAN AND CLEITOPHON THE SON OF
ARISTONYMUS
THERE TOO WAS CEPHALUS THE FATHER OF POLEMARCHUS WHOM I
HAD NOT SEEN FOR A LONG TIME AND I THOUGHT HIM VERY MUCH AGED
HE WAS
SEATED ON A CUSHIONED CHAIR AND HAD A GARLAND ON HIS HEAD FOR HE HAD
BEEN SACRIFICING IN THE COURT AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER CHAIRS IN THE
ROOM ARRANGED IN A SEMICIRCLE UPON WHICH WE SAT DOWN BY HIM
HE SALUTED
ME EAGERLY AND THEN HE SAID
YOU DON'T COME TO SEE ME SOCRATES AS OFTEN AS YOU OUGHT IF I WERE
STILL ABLE TO GO AND SEE YOU I WOULD NOT ASK YOU TO COME TO ME
BUT
AT MY AGE I CAN HARDLY GET TO THE CITY AND THEREFORE YOU SHOULD COME
OFTENER TO THE PIRAEUS
FOR LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE MORE THE PLEASURES
OF THE BODY FADE AWAY THE GREATER TO ME IS THE PLEASURE AND CHARM
OF CONVERSATION
DO NOT THEN DENY MY REQUEST BUT MAKE OUR HOUSE YOUR
RESORT AND KEEP COMPANY WITH THESE YOUNG MEN WE ARE OLD FRIENDS AND
YOU WILL BE QUITE AT HOME WITH US
I REPLIED THERE IS NOTHING WHICH FOR MY PART I LIKE BETTER CEPHALUS
THAN CONVERSING WITH AGED MEN FOR I REGARD THEM AS TRAVELLERS WHO
HAVE GONE A JOURNEY WHICH I TOO MAY HAVE TO GO AND OF WHOM I OUGHT TO
ENQUIRE WHETHER THE WAY IS SMOOTH AND EASY OR RUGGED AND DIFFICULT
AND THIS IS A QUESTION WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK OF YOU WHO HAVE
ARRIVED AT THAT TIME WHICH THE POETS CALL THE 'THRESHOLD OF OLD AGE' IS
LIFE HARDER TOWARDS THE END OR WHAT REPORT DO YOU GIVE OF IT
I WILL TELL YOU SOCRATES HE SAID WHAT MY OWN FEELING IS
MEN OF MY
AGE FLOCK TOGETHER WE ARE BIRDS OF A FEATHER AS THE OLD PROVERB SAYS
AND AT OUR MEETINGS THE TALE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE COMMONLY IS I CANNOT
EAT I CANNOT DRINK THE PLEASURES OF YOUTH AND LOVE ARE FLED AWAY
THERE WAS A GOOD TIME ONCE BUT NOW THAT IS GONE AND LIFE IS NO LONGER
LIFE
SOME COMPLAIN OF THE SLIGHTS WHICH ARE PUT UPON THEM BY RELATIONS
AND THEY WILL TELL YOU SADLY OF HOW MANY EVILS THEIR OLD AGE IS THE
CAUSE
BUT TO ME SOCRATES THESE COMPLAINERS SEEM TO BLAME THAT WHICH
IS NOT REALLY IN FAULT
FOR IF OLD AGE WERE THE CAUSE I TOO BEING OLD
AND EVERY OTHER OLD MAN WOULD HAVE FELT AS THEY DO
BUT THIS IS NOT
MY OWN EXPERIENCE NOR THAT OF OTHERS WHOM I HAVE KNOWN
HOW WELL I
REMEMBER THE AGED POET SOPHOCLES WHEN IN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW
DOES LOVE SUIT WITH AGE SOPHOCLES ARE YOU STILL THE MAN YOU WERE
PEACE HE REPLIED MOST GLADLY HAVE I ESCAPED THE THING OF WHICH YOU
SPEAK I FEEL AS IF I HAD ESCAPED FROM A MAD AND FURIOUS MASTER
HIS
WORDS HAVE OFTEN OCCURRED TO MY MIND SINCE AND THEY SEEM AS GOOD TO
ME NOW AS AT THE TIME WHEN HE UTTERED THEM
FOR CERTAINLY OLD AGE HAS
A GREAT SENSE OF CALM AND FREEDOM WHEN THE PASSIONS RELAX THEIR HOLD
THEN AS SOPHOCLES SAYS WE ARE FREED FROM THE GRASP NOT OF ONE MAD
MASTER ONLY BUT OF MANY
THE TRUTH IS SOCRATES THAT THESE REGRETS
AND ALSO THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT RELATIONS ARE TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE
SAME CAUSE WHICH IS NOT OLD AGE BUT MEN'S CHARACTERS AND TEMPERS FOR
HE WHO IS OF A CALM AND HAPPY NATURE WILL HARDLY FEEL THE PRESSURE OF
AGE BUT TO HIM WHO IS OF AN OPPOSITE DISPOSITION YOUTH AND AGE ARE
EQUALLY A BURDEN
I LISTENED IN ADMIRATION AND WANTING TO DRAW HIM OUT THAT HE MIGHT GO
ON YES CEPHALUS I SAID BUT I RATHER SUSPECT THAT PEOPLE IN GENERAL
ARE NOT CONVINCED BY YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK THUS THEY THINK THAT OLD
AGE SITS LIGHTLY UPON YOU NOT BECAUSE OF YOUR HAPPY DISPOSITION BUT
BECAUSE YOU ARE RICH AND WEALTH IS WELL KNOWN TO BE A GREAT COMFORTER
YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED THEY ARE NOT CONVINCED AND THERE IS
SOMETHING IN WHAT THEY SAY NOT HOWEVER SO MUCH AS THEY IMAGINE
I
MIGHT ANSWER THEM AS THEMISTOCLES ANSWERED THE SERIPHIAN WHO WAS ABUSING
HIM AND SAYING THAT HE WAS FAMOUS NOT FOR HIS OWN MERITS BUT BECAUSE HE
WAS AN ATHENIAN 'IF YOU HAD BEEN A NATIVE OF MY COUNTRY OR I OF YOURS
NEITHER OF US WOULD HAVE BEEN FAMOUS AND TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT RICH AND
ARE IMPATIENT OF OLD AGE THE SAME REPLY MAY BE MADE FOR TO THE GOOD
POOR MAN OLD AGE CANNOT BE A LIGHT BURDEN NOR CAN A BAD RICH MAN EVER
HAVE PEACE WITH HIMSELF
MAY I ASK CEPHALUS WHETHER YOUR FORTUNE WAS FOR THE MOST PART
INHERITED OR ACQUIRED BY YOU
ACQUIRED SOCRATES DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH I ACQUIRED IN THE ART
OF MAKING MONEY I HAVE BEEN MIDWAY BETWEEN MY FATHER AND GRANDFATHER
FOR MY GRANDFATHER WHOSE NAME I BEAR DOUBLED AND TREBLED THE VALUE OF
HIS PATRIMONY THAT WHICH HE INHERITED BEING MUCH WHAT I POSSESS NOW
BUT MY FATHER LYSANIAS REDUCED THE PROPERTY BELOW WHAT IT IS AT PRESENT
AND I SHALL BE SATISFIED IF I LEAVE TO THESE MY SONS NOT LESS BUT A
LITTLE MORE THAN I RECEIVED
THAT WAS WHY I ASKED YOU THE QUESTION I REPLIED BECAUSE I SEE THAT YOU
ARE INDIFFERENT ABOUT MONEY WHICH IS A CHARACTERISTIC RATHER OF THOSE
WHO HAVE INHERITED THEIR FORTUNES THAN OF THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED THEM
THE MAKERS OF FORTUNES HAVE A SECOND LOVE OF MONEY AS A CREATION OF
THEIR OWN RESEMBLING THE AFFECTION OF AUTHORS FOR THEIR OWN POEMS OR
OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN BESIDES THAT NATURAL LOVE OF IT FOR THE
SAKE OF USE AND PROFIT WHICH IS COMMON TO THEM AND ALL MEN
AND HENCE
THEY ARE VERY BAD COMPANY FOR THEY CAN TALK ABOUT NOTHING BUT THE
PRAISES OF WEALTH
THAT IS TRUE HE SAID
YES THAT IS VERY TRUE BUT MAY I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION WHAT DO YOU
CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST BLESSING WHICH YOU HAVE REAPED FROM YOUR
WEALTH
ONE HE SAID OF WHICH I COULD NOT EXPECT EASILY TO CONVINCE OTHERS
FOR LET ME TELL YOU SOCRATES THAT WHEN A MAN THINKS HIMSELF TO BE NEAR
DEATH FEARS AND CARES ENTER INTO HIS MIND WHICH HE NEVER HAD BEFORE
THE TALES OF A WORLD BELOW AND THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS EXACTED THERE
OF DEEDS DONE HERE WERE ONCE A LAUGHING MATTER TO HIM BUT NOW HE
IS TORMENTED WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THEY MAY BE TRUE EITHER FROM THE
WEAKNESS OF AGE OR BECAUSE HE IS NOW DRAWING NEARER TO THAT OTHER
PLACE HE HAS A CLEARER VIEW OF THESE THINGS SUSPICIONS AND ALARMS
CROWD THICKLY UPON HIM AND HE BEGINS TO REFLECT AND CONSIDER WHAT
WRONGS HE HAS DONE TO OTHERS
AND WHEN HE FINDS THAT THE SUM OF HIS
TRANSGRESSIONS IS GREAT HE WILL MANY A TIME LIKE A CHILD START UP IN HIS
SLEEP FOR FEAR AND HE IS FILLED WITH DARK FOREBODINGS
BUT TO HIM WHO
IS CONSCIOUS OF NO SIN SWEET HOPE AS PINDAR CHARMINGLY SAYS IS THE
KIND NURSE OF HIS AGE
'HOPE HE SAYS 'CHERISHES THE SOUL OF HIM WHO LIVES IN JUSTICE
AND HOLINESS AND IS THE NURSE OF HIS AGE AND THE COMPANION OF HIS
JOURNEY HOPE WHICH IS MIGHTIEST TO SWAY THE RESTLESS SOUL OF MAN
HOW ADMIRABLE ARE HIS WORDS AND THE GREAT BLESSING OF RICHES I DO NOT
SAY TO EVERY MAN BUT TO A GOOD MAN IS THAT HE HAS HAD NO OCCASION TO
DECEIVE OR TO DEFRAUD OTHERS EITHER INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY
AND WHEN HE DEPARTS TO THE WORLD BELOW HE IS NOT IN ANY APPREHENSION
ABOUT OFFERINGS DUE TO THE GODS OR DEBTS WHICH HE OWES TO MEN
NOW TO
THIS PEACE OF MIND THE POSSESSION OF WEALTH GREATLY CONTRIBUTES AND
THEREFORE I SAY THAT SETTING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER OF THE MANY
ADVANTAGES WHICH WEALTH HAS TO GIVE TO A MAN OF SENSE THIS IS IN MY
OPINION THE GREATEST
WELL SAID CEPHALUS I REPLIED BUT AS CONCERNING JUSTICE WHAT IS
IT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND TO PAY YOUR DEBTS NO MORE THAN THIS AND
EVEN TO THIS ARE THERE NOT EXCEPTIONS SUPPOSE THAT A FRIEND WHEN IN HIS
RIGHT MIND HAS DEPOSITED ARMS WITH ME AND HE ASKS FOR THEM WHEN HE IS
NOT IN HIS RIGHT MIND OUGHT I TO GIVE THEM BACK TO HIM NO ONE WOULD
SAY THAT I OUGHT OR THAT I SHOULD BE RIGHT IN DOING SO ANY MORE THAN
THEY WOULD SAY THAT I OUGHT ALWAYS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH TO ONE WHO IS IN
HIS CONDITION
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT HE REPLIED
BUT THEN I SAID SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND PAYING YOUR DEBTS IS NOT A
CORRECT DEFINITION OF JUSTICE
QUITE CORRECT SOCRATES IF SIMONIDES IS TO BE BELIEVED SAID
POLEMARCHUS INTERPOSING
I FEAR SAID CEPHALUS THAT I MUST GO NOW FOR I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER THE
SACRIFICES AND I HAND OVER THE ARGUMENT TO POLEMARCHUS AND THE COMPANY
IS NOT POLEMARCHUS YOUR HEIR I SAID
TO BE SURE HE ANSWERED AND WENT AWAY LAUGHING TO THE SACRIFICES
TELL ME THEN O THOU HEIR OF THE ARGUMENT WHAT DID SIMONIDES SAY AND
ACCORDING TO YOU TRULY SAY ABOUT JUSTICE
HE SAID THAT THE REPAYMENT OF A DEBT IS JUST AND IN SAYING SO HE
APPEARS TO ME TO BE RIGHT
I SHOULD BE SORRY TO DOUBT THE WORD OF SUCH A WISE AND INSPIRED MAN BUT
HIS MEANING THOUGH PROBABLY CLEAR TO YOU IS THE REVERSE OF CLEAR TO
ME
FOR HE CERTAINLY DOES NOT MEAN AS WE WERE JUST NOW SAYING THAT I
OUGHT TO RETURN A DEPOSIT OF ARMS OR OF ANYTHING ELSE TO ONE WHO ASKS
FOR IT WHEN HE IS NOT IN HIS RIGHT SENSES AND YET A DEPOSIT CANNOT BE
DENIED TO BE A DEBT
TRUE
THEN WHEN THE PERSON WHO ASKS ME IS NOT IN HIS RIGHT MIND I AM BY NO
MEANS TO MAKE THE RETURN
CERTAINLY NOT
WHEN SIMONIDES SAID THAT THE REPAYMENT OF A DEBT WAS JUSTICE HE DID NOT
MEAN TO INCLUDE THAT CASE
CERTAINLY NOT FOR HE THINKS THAT A FRIEND OUGHT ALWAYS TO DO GOOD TO A
FRIEND AND NEVER EVIL
YOU MEAN THAT THE RETURN OF A DEPOSIT OF GOLD WHICH IS TO THE INJURY OF
THE RECEIVER IF THE TWO PARTIES ARE FRIENDS IS NOT THE REPAYMENT OF A
DEBT THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE HIM TO SAY
YES
AND ARE ENEMIES ALSO TO RECEIVE WHAT WE OWE TO THEM
TO BE SURE HE SAID THEY ARE TO RECEIVE WHAT WE OWE THEM AND AN ENEMY
AS I TAKE IT OWES TO AN ENEMY THAT WHICH IS DUE OR PROPER TO HIM THAT
IS TO SAY EVIL
SIMONIDES THEN AFTER THE MANNER OF POETS WOULD SEEM TO HAVE SPOKEN
DARKLY OF THE NATURE OF JUSTICE FOR HE REALLY MEANT TO SAY THAT JUSTICE
IS THE GIVING TO EACH MAN WHAT IS PROPER TO HIM AND THIS HE TERMED A
DEBT
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HIS MEANING HE SAID
BY HEAVEN I REPLIED AND IF WE ASKED HIM WHAT DUE OR PROPER THING IS
GIVEN BY MEDICINE AND TO WHOM WHAT ANSWER DO YOU THINK THAT HE WOULD
MAKE TO US
HE WOULD SURELY REPLY THAT MEDICINE GIVES DRUGS AND MEAT AND DRINK TO
HUMAN BODIES
AND WHAT DUE OR PROPER THING IS GIVEN BY COOKERY AND TO WHAT
SEASONING TO FOOD
AND WHAT IS THAT WHICH JUSTICE GIVES AND TO WHOM
IF SOCRATES WE ARE TO BE GUIDED AT ALL BY THE ANALOGY OF THE PRECEDING
INSTANCES THEN JUSTICE IS THE ART WHICH GIVES GOOD TO FRIENDS AND EVIL
TO ENEMIES
THAT IS HIS MEANING THEN
I THINK SO
AND WHO IS BEST ABLE TO DO GOOD TO HIS FRIENDS AND EVIL TO HIS ENEMIES
IN TIME OF SICKNESS
THE PHYSICIAN
OR WHEN THEY ARE ON A VOYAGE AMID THE PERILS OF THE SEA
THE PILOT
AND IN WHAT SORT OF ACTIONS OR WITH A VIEW TO WHAT RESULT IS THE JUST
MAN MOST ABLE TO DO HARM TO HIS ENEMY AND GOOD TO HIS FRIEND
IN GOING TO WAR AGAINST THE ONE AND IN MAKING ALLIANCES WITH THE OTHER
BUT WHEN A MAN IS WELL MY DEAR POLEMARCHUS THERE IS NO NEED OF A
PHYSICIAN
NO
AND HE WHO IS NOT ON A VOYAGE HAS NO NEED OF A PILOT
NO
THEN IN TIME OF PEACE JUSTICE WILL BE OF NO USE
I AM VERY FAR FROM THINKING SO
YOU THINK THAT JUSTICE MAY BE OF USE IN PEACE AS WELL AS IN WAR
YES
LIKE HUSBANDRY FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CORN
YES
OR LIKE SHOEMAKING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SHOES THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN
YES
AND WHAT SIMILAR USE OR POWER OF ACQUISITION HAS JUSTICE IN TIME OF
PEACE
IN CONTRACTS SOCRATES JUSTICE IS OF USE
AND BY CONTRACTS YOU MEAN PARTNERSHIPS
EXACTLY
BUT IS THE JUST MAN OR THE SKILFUL PLAYER A MORE USEFUL AND BETTER
PARTNER AT A GAME OF DRAUGHTS
THE SKILFUL PLAYER
AND IN THE LAYING OF BRICKS AND STONES IS THE JUST MAN A MORE USEFUL OR
BETTER PARTNER THAN THE BUILDER
QUITE THE REVERSE
THEN IN WHAT SORT OF PARTNERSHIP IS THE JUST MAN A BETTER PARTNER THAN
THE HARP PLAYER AS IN PLAYING THE HARP THE HARP PLAYER IS CERTAINLY A
BETTER PARTNER THAN THE JUST MAN
IN A MONEY PARTNERSHIP
YES POLEMARCHUS BUT SURELY NOT IN THE USE OF MONEY FOR YOU DO NOT
WANT A JUST MAN TO BE YOUR COUNSELLOR IN THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF A
HORSE A MAN WHO IS KNOWING ABOUT HORSES WOULD BE BETTER FOR THAT WOULD
HE NOT
CERTAINLY
AND WHEN YOU WANT TO BUY A SHIP THE SHIPWRIGHT OR THE PILOT WOULD BE
BETTER
TRUE
THEN WHAT IS THAT JOINT USE OF SILVER OR GOLD IN WHICH THE JUST MAN IS
TO BE PREFERRED
WHEN YOU WANT A DEPOSIT TO BE KEPT SAFELY
YOU MEAN WHEN MONEY IS NOT WANTED BUT ALLOWED TO LIE
PRECISELY
THAT IS TO SAY JUSTICE IS USEFUL WHEN MONEY IS USELESS
THAT IS THE INFERENCE
AND WHEN YOU WANT TO KEEP A PRUNING HOOK SAFE THEN JUSTICE IS USEFUL TO
THE INDIVIDUAL AND TO THE STATE BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO USE IT THEN THE
ART OF THE VINE DRESSER
CLEARLY
AND WHEN YOU WANT TO KEEP A SHIELD OR A LYRE AND NOT TO USE THEM YOU
WOULD SAY THAT JUSTICE IS USEFUL BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO USE THEM THEN
THE ART OF THE SOLDIER OR OF THE MUSICIAN
CERTAINLY
AND SO OF ALL OTHER THINGS JUSTICE IS USEFUL WHEN THEY ARE USELESS
AND USELESS WHEN THEY ARE USEFUL
THAT IS THE INFERENCE
THEN JUSTICE IS NOT GOOD FOR MUCH
BUT LET US CONSIDER THIS FURTHER
POINT IS NOT HE WHO CAN BEST STRIKE A BLOW IN A BOXING MATCH OR IN ANY
KIND OF FIGHTING BEST ABLE TO WARD OFF A BLOW
CERTAINLY
AND HE WHO IS MOST SKILFUL IN PREVENTING OR ESCAPING FROM A DISEASE IS
BEST ABLE TO CREATE ONE
TRUE
AND HE IS THE BEST GUARD OF A CAMP WHO IS BEST ABLE TO STEAL A MARCH
UPON THE ENEMY
CERTAINLY
THEN HE WHO IS A GOOD KEEPER OF ANYTHING IS ALSO A GOOD THIEF
THAT I SUPPOSE IS TO BE INFERRED
THEN IF THE JUST MAN IS GOOD AT KEEPING MONEY HE IS GOOD AT STEALING
IT
THAT IS IMPLIED IN THE ARGUMENT
THEN AFTER ALL THE JUST MAN HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A THIEF
AND THIS IS
A LESSON WHICH I SUSPECT YOU MUST HAVE LEARNT OUT OF HOMER FOR HE
SPEAKING OF AUTOLYCUS THE MATERNAL GRANDFATHER OF ODYSSEUS WHO IS A
FAVOURITE OF HIS AFFIRMS THAT
'HE WAS EXCELLENT ABOVE ALL MEN IN THEFT AND PERJURY
AND SO YOU AND HOMER AND SIMONIDES ARE AGREED THAT JUSTICE IS AN ART OF
THEFT TO BE PRACTISED HOWEVER 'FOR THE GOOD OF FRIENDS AND FOR THE HARM
OF ENEMIES THAT WAS WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
NO CERTAINLY NOT THAT THOUGH I DO NOT NOW KNOW WHAT I DID SAY BUT I
STILL STAND BY THE LATTER WORDS
WELL THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION BY FRIENDS AND ENEMIES DO WE MEAN THOSE
WHO ARE SO REALLY OR ONLY IN SEEMING
SURELY HE SAID A MAN MAY BE EXPECTED TO LOVE THOSE WHOM HE THINKS
GOOD AND TO HATE THOSE WHOM HE THINKS EVIL
YES BUT DO NOT PERSONS OFTEN ERR ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL MANY WHO ARE NOT
GOOD SEEM TO BE SO AND CONVERSELY
THAT IS TRUE
THEN TO THEM THE GOOD WILL BE ENEMIES AND THE EVIL WILL BE THEIR
FRIENDS TRUE
AND IN THAT CASE THEY WILL BE RIGHT IN DOING GOOD TO THE EVIL AND EVIL
TO THE GOOD
CLEARLY
BUT THE GOOD ARE JUST AND WOULD NOT DO AN INJUSTICE
TRUE
THEN ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT IT IS JUST TO INJURE THOSE WHO DO NO
WRONG
NAY SOCRATES THE DOCTRINE IS IMMORAL
THEN I SUPPOSE THAT WE OUGHT TO DO GOOD TO THE JUST AND HARM TO THE
UNJUST
I LIKE THAT BETTER
BUT SEE THE CONSEQUENCE MANY A MAN WHO IS IGNORANT OF HUMAN NATURE
HAS FRIENDS WHO ARE BAD FRIENDS AND IN THAT CASE HE OUGHT TO DO HARM TO
THEM AND HE HAS GOOD ENEMIES WHOM HE OUGHT TO BENEFIT BUT IF SO WE
SHALL BE SAYING THE VERY OPPOSITE OF THAT WHICH WE AFFIRMED TO BE THE
MEANING OF SIMONIDES
VERY TRUE HE SAID AND I THINK THAT WE HAD BETTER CORRECT AN ERROR
INTO WHICH WE SEEM TO HAVE FALLEN IN THE USE OF THE WORDS 'FRIEND' AND
'ENEMY
WHAT WAS THE ERROR POLEMARCHUS I ASKED
WE ASSUMED THAT HE IS A FRIEND WHO SEEMS TO BE OR WHO IS THOUGHT GOOD
AND HOW IS THE ERROR TO BE CORRECTED
WE SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT HE IS A FRIEND WHO IS AS WELL AS SEEMS GOOD
AND THAT HE WHO SEEMS ONLY AND IS NOT GOOD ONLY SEEMS TO BE AND IS NOT
A FRIEND AND OF AN ENEMY THE SAME MAY BE SAID
YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT THE GOOD ARE OUR FRIENDS AND THE BAD OUR ENEMIES
YES
AND INSTEAD OF SAYING SIMPLY AS WE DID AT FIRST THAT IT IS JUST TO DO
GOOD TO OUR FRIENDS AND HARM TO OUR ENEMIES WE SHOULD FURTHER SAY IT
IS JUST TO DO GOOD TO OUR FRIENDS WHEN THEY ARE GOOD AND HARM TO OUR
ENEMIES WHEN THEY ARE EVIL
YES THAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE TRUTH
BUT OUGHT THE JUST TO INJURE ANY ONE AT ALL
UNDOUBTEDLY HE OUGHT TO INJURE THOSE WHO ARE BOTH WICKED AND HIS
ENEMIES
WHEN HORSES ARE INJURED ARE THEY IMPROVED OR DETERIORATED
THE LATTER
DETERIORATED THAT IS TO SAY IN THE GOOD QUALITIES OF HORSES NOT OF
DOGS
YES OF HORSES
AND DOGS ARE DETERIORATED IN THE GOOD QUALITIES OF DOGS AND NOT OF
HORSES
OF COURSE
AND WILL NOT MEN WHO ARE INJURED BE DETERIORATED IN THAT WHICH IS THE
PROPER VIRTUE OF MAN
CERTAINLY
AND THAT HUMAN VIRTUE IS JUSTICE
TO BE SURE
THEN MEN WHO ARE INJURED ARE OF NECESSITY MADE UNJUST
THAT IS THE RESULT
BUT CAN THE MUSICIAN BY HIS ART MAKE MEN UNMUSICAL
CERTAINLY NOT
OR THE HORSEMAN BY HIS ART MAKE THEM BAD HORSEMEN
IMPOSSIBLE
AND CAN THE JUST BY JUSTICE MAKE MEN UNJUST OR SPEAKING GENERALLY CAN
THE GOOD BY VIRTUE MAKE THEM BAD
ASSUREDLY NOT
ANY MORE THAN HEAT CAN PRODUCE COLD
IT CANNOT
OR DROUGHT MOISTURE
CLEARLY NOT
NOR CAN THE GOOD HARM ANY ONE
IMPOSSIBLE
AND THE JUST IS THE GOOD
CERTAINLY
THEN TO INJURE A FRIEND OR ANY ONE ELSE IS NOT THE ACT OF A JUST MAN
BUT OF THE OPPOSITE WHO IS THE UNJUST
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS QUITE TRUE SOCRATES
THEN IF A MAN SAYS THAT JUSTICE CONSISTS IN THE REPAYMENT OF DEBTS AND
THAT GOOD IS THE DEBT WHICH A JUST MAN OWES TO HIS FRIENDS AND EVIL THE
DEBT WHICH HE OWES TO HIS ENEMIES TO SAY THIS IS NOT WISE FOR IT IS
NOT TRUE IF AS HAS BEEN CLEARLY SHOWN THE INJURING OF ANOTHER CAN BE
IN NO CASE JUST
I AGREE WITH YOU SAID POLEMARCHUS
THEN YOU AND I ARE PREPARED TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST ANY ONE WHO
ATTRIBUTES SUCH A SAYING TO SIMONIDES OR BIAS OR PITTACUS OR ANY OTHER
WISE MAN OR SEER
I AM QUITE READY TO DO BATTLE AT YOUR SIDE HE SAID
SHALL I TELL YOU WHOSE I BELIEVE THE SAYING TO BE
WHOSE
I BELIEVE THAT PERIANDER OR PERDICCAS OR XERXES OR ISMENIAS THE THEBAN
OR SOME OTHER RICH AND MIGHTY MAN WHO HAD A GREAT OPINION OF HIS OWN
POWER WAS THE FIRST TO SAY THAT JUSTICE IS 'DOING GOOD TO YOUR FRIENDS
AND HARM TO YOUR ENEMIES
MOST TRUE HE SAID
YES I SAID BUT IF THIS DEFINITION OF JUSTICE ALSO BREAKS DOWN WHAT
OTHER CAN BE OFFERED
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE COURSE OF THE DISCUSSION THRASYMACHUS HAD MADE AN
ATTEMPT TO GET THE ARGUMENT INTO HIS OWN HANDS AND HAD BEEN PUT DOWN
BY THE REST OF THE COMPANY WHO WANTED TO HEAR THE END
BUT WHEN
POLEMARCHUS AND I HAD DONE SPEAKING AND THERE WAS A PAUSE HE COULD NO
LONGER HOLD HIS PEACE AND GATHERING HIMSELF UP HE CAME AT US LIKE A
WILD BEAST SEEKING TO DEVOUR US
WE WERE QUITE PANIC STRICKEN AT THE
SIGHT OF HIM
HE ROARED OUT TO THE WHOLE COMPANY WHAT FOLLY SOCRATES HAS TAKEN
POSSESSION OF YOU ALL AND WHY SILLYBILLIES DO YOU KNOCK UNDER TO
ONE ANOTHER I SAY THAT IF YOU WANT REALLY TO KNOW WHAT JUSTICE IS
YOU SHOULD NOT ONLY ASK BUT ANSWER AND YOU SHOULD NOT SEEK HONOUR TO
YOURSELF FROM THE REFUTATION OF AN OPPONENT BUT HAVE YOUR OWN ANSWER
FOR THERE IS MANY A ONE WHO CAN ASK AND CANNOT ANSWER
AND NOW I WILL
NOT HAVE YOU SAY THAT JUSTICE IS DUTY OR ADVANTAGE OR PROFIT OR GAIN
OR INTEREST FOR THIS SORT OF NONSENSE WILL NOT DO FOR ME I MUST HAVE
CLEARNESS AND ACCURACY
I WAS PANIC STRICKEN AT HIS WORDS AND COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM WITHOUT
TREMBLING
INDEED I BELIEVE THAT IF I HAD NOT FIXED MY EYE UPON HIM I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK DUMB BUT WHEN I SAW HIS FURY RISING I LOOKED
AT HIM FIRST AND WAS THEREFORE ABLE TO REPLY TO HIM
THRASYMACHUS I SAID WITH A QUIVER DON'T BE HARD UPON US
POLEMARCHUS
AND I MAY HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF A LITTLE MISTAKE IN THE ARGUMENT BUT I
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE ERROR WAS NOT INTENTIONAL
IF WE WERE SEEKING
FOR A PIECE OF GOLD YOU WOULD NOT IMAGINE THAT WE WERE 'KNOCKING UNDER
TO ONE ANOTHER AND SO LOSING OUR CHANCE OF FINDING IT
AND WHY WHEN
WE ARE SEEKING FOR JUSTICE A THING MORE PRECIOUS THAN MANY PIECES OF
GOLD DO YOU SAY THAT WE ARE WEAKLY YIELDING TO ONE ANOTHER AND NOT
DOING OUR UTMOST TO GET AT THE TRUTH NAY MY GOOD FRIEND WE ARE MOST
WILLING AND ANXIOUS TO DO SO BUT THE FACT IS THAT WE CANNOT
AND IF SO
YOU PEOPLE WHO KNOW ALL THINGS SHOULD PITY US AND NOT BE ANGRY WITH US
HOW CHARACTERISTIC OF SOCRATES HE REPLIED WITH A BITTER LAUGH THAT'S
YOUR IRONICAL STYLE DID I NOT FORESEE HAVE I NOT ALREADY TOLD YOU
THAT WHATEVER HE WAS ASKED HE WOULD REFUSE TO ANSWER AND TRY IRONY OR
ANY OTHER SHUFFLE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT AVOID ANSWERING
YOU ARE A PHILOSOPHER THRASYMACHUS I REPLIED AND WELL KNOW THAT IF
YOU ASK A PERSON WHAT NUMBERS MAKE UP TWELVE TAKING CARE TO PROHIBIT
HIM WHOM YOU ASK FROM ANSWERING TWICE SIX OR THREE TIMES FOUR OR SIX
TIMES TWO OR FOUR TIMES THREE 'FOR THIS SORT OF NONSENSE WILL NOT DO
FOR ME THEN OBVIOUSLY IF THAT IS YOUR WAY OF PUTTING THE
QUESTION NO ONE CAN ANSWER YOU
BUT SUPPOSE THAT HE WERE TO RETORT
'THRASYMACHUS WHAT DO YOU MEAN IF ONE OF THESE NUMBERS WHICH YOU
INTERDICT BE THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION AM I FALSELY TO SAY SOME
OTHER NUMBER WHICH IS NOT THE RIGHT ONE IS THAT YOUR MEANING HOW
WOULD YOU ANSWER HIM
JUST AS IF THE TWO CASES WERE AT ALL ALIKE HE SAID
WHY SHOULD THEY NOT BE I REPLIED AND EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT BUT ONLY
APPEAR TO BE SO TO THE PERSON WHO IS ASKED OUGHT HE NOT TO SAY WHAT HE
THINKS WHETHER YOU AND I FORBID HIM OR NOT
I PRESUME THEN THAT YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE ONE OF THE INTERDICTED
ANSWERS
I DARE SAY THAT I MAY NOTWITHSTANDING THE DANGER IF UPON REFLECTION I
APPROVE OF ANY OF THEM
BUT WHAT IF I GIVE YOU AN ANSWER ABOUT JUSTICE OTHER AND BETTER HE
SAID THAN ANY OF THESE WHAT DO YOU DESERVE TO HAVE DONE TO YOU
DONE TO ME AS BECOMES THE IGNORANT I MUST LEARN FROM THE WISE THAT
IS WHAT I DESERVE TO HAVE DONE TO ME
WHAT AND NO PAYMENT A PLEASANT NOTION
I WILL PAY WHEN I HAVE THE MONEY I REPLIED
BUT YOU HAVE SOCRATES SAID GLAUCON AND YOU THRASYMACHUS NEED BE
UNDER NO ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY FOR WE WILL ALL MAKE A CONTRIBUTION FOR
SOCRATES
YES HE REPLIED AND THEN SOCRATES WILL DO AS HE ALWAYS DOES REFUSE TO
ANSWER HIMSELF BUT TAKE AND PULL TO PIECES THE ANSWER OF SOME ONE ELSE
WHY MY GOOD FRIEND I SAID HOW CAN ANY ONE ANSWER WHO KNOWS AND SAYS
THAT HE KNOWS JUST NOTHING AND WHO EVEN IF HE HAS SOME FAINT NOTIONS
OF HIS OWN IS TOLD BY A MAN OF AUTHORITY NOT TO UTTER THEM THE
NATURAL THING IS THAT THE SPEAKER SHOULD BE SOME ONE LIKE YOURSELF
WHO PROFESSES TO KNOW AND CAN TELL WHAT HE KNOWS
WILL YOU THEN KINDLY
ANSWER FOR THE EDIFICATION OF THE COMPANY AND OF MYSELF
GLAUCON AND THE REST OF THE COMPANY JOINED IN MY REQUEST AND
THRASYMACHUS AS ANY ONE MIGHT SEE WAS IN REALITY EAGER TO SPEAK
FOR HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EXCELLENT ANSWER AND WOULD DISTINGUISH
HIMSELF
BUT AT FIRST HE AFFECTED TO INSIST ON MY ANSWERING AT LENGTH
HE CONSENTED TO BEGIN
BEHOLD HE SAID THE WISDOM OF SOCRATES HE
REFUSES TO TEACH HIMSELF AND GOES ABOUT LEARNING OF OTHERS TO WHOM HE
NEVER EVEN SAYS THANK YOU
THAT I LEARN OF OTHERS I REPLIED IS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT I AM
UNGRATEFUL I WHOLLY DENY
MONEY I HAVE NONE AND THEREFORE I PAY IN
PRAISE WHICH IS ALL I HAVE AND HOW READY I AM TO PRAISE ANY ONE WHO
APPEARS TO ME TO SPEAK WELL YOU WILL VERY SOON FIND OUT WHEN YOU ANSWER
FOR I EXPECT THAT YOU WILL ANSWER WELL
LISTEN THEN HE SAID I PROCLAIM THAT JUSTICE IS NOTHING ELSE THAN
THE INTEREST OF THE STRONGER
AND NOW WHY DO YOU NOT PRAISE ME BUT OF
COURSE YOU WON'T
LET ME FIRST UNDERSTAND YOU I REPLIED
JUSTICE AS YOU SAY IS THE
INTEREST OF THE STRONGER
WHAT THRASYMACHUS IS THE MEANING OF THIS
YOU CANNOT MEAN TO SAY THAT BECAUSE POLYDAMAS THE PANCRATIAST IS
STRONGER THAN WE ARE AND FINDS THE EATING OF BEEF CONDUCIVE TO HIS
BODILY STRENGTH THAT TO EAT BEEF IS THEREFORE EQUALLY FOR OUR GOOD WHO
ARE WEAKER THAN HE IS AND RIGHT AND JUST FOR US
THAT'S ABOMINABLE OF YOU SOCRATES YOU TAKE THE WORDS IN THE SENSE
WHICH IS MOST DAMAGING TO THE ARGUMENT
NOT AT ALL MY GOOD SIR I SAID I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND I
WISH THAT YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE CLEARER
WELL HE SAID HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THAT FORMS OF GOVERNMENT DIFFER
THERE ARE TYRANNIES AND THERE ARE DEMOCRACIES AND THERE ARE
ARISTOCRACIES
YES I KNOW
AND THE GOVERNMENT IS THE RULING POWER IN EACH STATE
CERTAINLY
AND THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF GOVERNMENT MAKE LAWS DEMOCRATICAL
ARISTOCRATICAL TYRANNICAL WITH A VIEW TO THEIR SEVERAL INTERESTS
AND THESE LAWS WHICH ARE MADE BY THEM FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS ARE THE
JUSTICE WHICH THEY DELIVER TO THEIR SUBJECTS AND HIM WHO TRANSGRESSES
THEM THEY PUNISH AS A BREAKER OF THE LAW AND UNJUST
AND THAT IS WHAT
I MEAN WHEN I SAY THAT IN ALL STATES THERE IS THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF
JUSTICE WHICH IS THE INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT AND AS THE GOVERNMENT
MUST BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE POWER THE ONLY REASONABLE CONCLUSION IS THAT
EVERYWHERE THERE IS ONE PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE WHICH IS THE INTEREST OF
THE STRONGER
NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU I SAID AND WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHT OR NOT I WILL
TRY TO DISCOVER
BUT LET ME REMARK THAT IN DEFINING JUSTICE YOU HAVE
YOURSELF USED THE WORD 'INTEREST' WHICH YOU FORBADE ME TO USE
IT IS
TRUE HOWEVER THAT IN YOUR DEFINITION THE WORDS 'OF THE STRONGER' ARE
ADDED
A SMALL ADDITION YOU MUST ALLOW HE SAID
GREAT OR SMALL NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT WE MUST FIRST ENQUIRE WHETHER
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THE TRUTH
NOW WE ARE BOTH AGREED THAT JUSTICE
IS INTEREST OF SOME SORT BUT YOU GO ON TO SAY 'OF THE STRONGER' ABOUT
THIS ADDITION I AM NOT SO SURE AND MUST THEREFORE CONSIDER FURTHER
PROCEED
I WILL AND FIRST TELL ME DO YOU ADMIT THAT IT IS JUST FOR SUBJECTS TO
OBEY THEIR RULERS
I DO
BUT ARE THE RULERS OF STATES ABSOLUTELY INFALLIBLE OR ARE THEY
SOMETIMES LIABLE TO ERR
TO BE SURE HE REPLIED THEY ARE LIABLE TO ERR
THEN IN MAKING THEIR LAWS THEY MAY SOMETIMES MAKE THEM RIGHTLY AND
SOMETIMES NOT
TRUE
WHEN THEY MAKE THEM RIGHTLY THEY MAKE THEM AGREEABLY TO THEIR INTEREST
WHEN THEY ARE MISTAKEN CONTRARY TO THEIR INTEREST YOU ADMIT THAT
YES
AND THE LAWS WHICH THEY MAKE MUST BE OBEYED BY THEIR SUBJECTS AND THAT
IS WHAT YOU CALL JUSTICE
DOUBTLESS
THEN JUSTICE ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT IS NOT ONLY OBEDIENCE TO THE
INTEREST OF THE STRONGER BUT THE REVERSE
WHAT IS THAT YOU ARE SAYING HE ASKED
I AM ONLY REPEATING WHAT YOU ARE SAYING I BELIEVE
BUT LET US CONSIDER
HAVE WE NOT ADMITTED THAT THE RULERS MAY BE MISTAKEN ABOUT THEIR OWN
INTEREST IN WHAT THEY COMMAND AND ALSO THAT TO OBEY THEM IS JUSTICE
HAS NOT THAT BEEN ADMITTED
YES
THEN YOU MUST ALSO HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED JUSTICE NOT TO BE FOR THE INTEREST
OF THE STRONGER WHEN THE RULERS UNINTENTIONALLY COMMAND THINGS TO BE
DONE WHICH ARE TO THEIR OWN INJURY
FOR IF AS YOU SAY JUSTICE IS THE
OBEDIENCE WHICH THE SUBJECT RENDERS TO THEIR COMMANDS IN THAT CASE O
WISEST OF MEN IS THERE ANY ESCAPE FROM THE CONCLUSION THAT THE WEAKER
ARE COMMANDED TO DO NOT WHAT IS FOR THE INTEREST BUT WHAT IS FOR THE
INJURY OF THE STRONGER
NOTHING CAN BE CLEARER SOCRATES SAID POLEMARCHUS
YES SAID CLEITOPHON INTERPOSING IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO BE HIS WITNESS
BUT THERE IS NO NEED OF ANY WITNESS SAID POLEMARCHUS FOR THRASYMACHUS
HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGES THAT RULERS MAY SOMETIMES COMMAND WHAT IS NOT FOR
THEIR OWN INTEREST AND THAT FOR SUBJECTS TO OBEY THEM IS JUSTICE
YES POLEMARCHUS THRASYMACHUS SAID THAT FOR SUBJECTS TO DO WHAT WAS
COMMANDED BY THEIR RULERS IS JUST
YES CLEITOPHON BUT HE ALSO SAID THAT JUSTICE IS THE INTEREST OF THE
STRONGER AND WHILE ADMITTING BOTH THESE PROPOSITIONS HE FURTHER
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE STRONGER MAY COMMAND THE WEAKER WHO ARE HIS
SUBJECTS TO DO WHAT IS NOT FOR HIS OWN INTEREST WHENCE FOLLOWS THAT
JUSTICE IS THE INJURY QUITE AS MUCH AS THE INTEREST OF THE STRONGER
BUT SAID CLEITOPHON HE MEANT BY THE INTEREST OF THE STRONGER WHAT THE
STRONGER THOUGHT TO BE HIS INTEREST THIS WAS WHAT THE WEAKER HAD TO
DO AND THIS WAS AFFIRMED BY HIM TO BE JUSTICE
THOSE WERE NOT HIS WORDS REJOINED POLEMARCHUS
NEVER MIND I REPLIED IF HE NOW SAYS THAT THEY ARE LET US ACCEPT HIS
STATEMENT
TELL ME THRASYMACHUS I SAID DID YOU MEAN BY JUSTICE WHAT
THE STRONGER THOUGHT TO BE HIS INTEREST WHETHER REALLY SO OR NOT
CERTAINLY NOT HE SAID
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I CALL HIM WHO IS MISTAKEN
THE STRONGER AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS MISTAKEN
YES I SAID MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT YOU DID SO WHEN YOU ADMITTED THAT
THE RULER WAS NOT INFALLIBLE BUT MIGHT BE SOMETIMES MISTAKEN
YOU ARGUE LIKE AN INFORMER SOCRATES
DO YOU MEAN FOR EXAMPLE THAT HE
WHO IS MISTAKEN ABOUT THE SICK IS A PHYSICIAN IN THAT HE IS MISTAKEN
OR THAT HE WHO ERRS IN ARITHMETIC OR GRAMMAR IS AN ARITHMETICIAN OR
GRAMMARIAN AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS MAKING THE MISTAKE IN RESPECT OF THE
MISTAKE TRUE WE SAY THAT THE PHYSICIAN OR ARITHMETICIAN OR GRAMMARIAN
HAS MADE A MISTAKE BUT THIS IS ONLY A WAY OF SPEAKING FOR THE FACT IS
THAT NEITHER THE GRAMMARIAN NOR ANY OTHER PERSON OF SKILL EVER MAKES A
MISTAKE IN SO FAR AS HE IS WHAT HIS NAME IMPLIES THEY NONE OF THEM
ERR UNLESS THEIR SKILL FAILS THEM AND THEN THEY CEASE TO BE SKILLED
ARTISTS
NO ARTIST OR SAGE OR RULER ERRS AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS WHAT
HIS NAME IMPLIES THOUGH HE IS COMMONLY SAID TO ERR AND I ADOPTED THE
COMMON MODE OF SPEAKING
BUT TO BE PERFECTLY ACCURATE SINCE YOU ARE
SUCH A LOVER OF ACCURACY WE SHOULD SAY THAT THE RULER IN SO FAR AS HE
IS A RULER IS UNERRING AND BEING UNERRING ALWAYS COMMANDS THAT WHICH
IS FOR HIS OWN INTEREST AND THE SUBJECT IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE HIS
COMMANDS AND THEREFORE AS I SAID AT FIRST AND NOW REPEAT JUSTICE IS
THE INTEREST OF THE STRONGER
INDEED THRASYMACHUS AND DO I REALLY APPEAR TO YOU TO ARGUE LIKE AN
INFORMER
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
AND DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT I ASK THESE QUESTIONS WITH ANY DESIGN OF
INJURING YOU IN THE ARGUMENT
NAY HE REPLIED 'SUPPOSE' IS NOT THE WORD I KNOW IT BUT YOU WILL BE
FOUND OUT AND BY SHEER FORCE OF ARGUMENT YOU WILL NEVER PREVAIL
I SHALL NOT MAKE THE ATTEMPT MY DEAR MAN BUT TO AVOID ANY
MISUNDERSTANDING OCCURRING BETWEEN US IN FUTURE LET ME ASK IN WHAT
SENSE DO YOU SPEAK OF A RULER OR STRONGER WHOSE INTEREST AS YOU WERE
SAYING HE BEING THE SUPERIOR IT IS JUST THAT THE INFERIOR SHOULD
EXECUTE IS HE A RULER IN THE POPULAR OR IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE
TERM
IN THE STRICTEST OF ALL SENSES HE SAID
AND NOW CHEAT AND PLAY THE
INFORMER IF YOU CAN I ASK NO QUARTER AT YOUR HANDS
BUT YOU NEVER WILL
BE ABLE NEVER
AND DO YOU IMAGINE I SAID THAT I AM SUCH A MADMAN AS TO TRY AND CHEAT
THRASYMACHUS I MIGHT AS WELL SHAVE A LION
WHY HE SAID YOU MADE THE ATTEMPT A MINUTE AGO AND YOU FAILED
ENOUGH I SAID OF THESE CIVILITIES
IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD ASK
YOU A QUESTION IS THE PHYSICIAN TAKEN IN THAT STRICT SENSE OF WHICH
YOU ARE SPEAKING A HEALER OF THE SICK OR A MAKER OF MONEY AND REMEMBER
THAT I AM NOW SPEAKING OF THE TRUE PHYSICIAN
A HEALER OF THE SICK HE REPLIED
AND THE PILOT THAT IS TO SAY THE TRUE PILOT IS HE A CAPTAIN OF
SAILORS OR A MERE SAILOR
A CAPTAIN OF SAILORS
THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE SAILS IN THE SHIP IS NOT TO BE TAKEN INTO
ACCOUNT NEITHER IS HE TO BE CALLED A SAILOR THE NAME PILOT BY WHICH HE
IS DISTINGUISHED HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SAILING BUT IS SIGNIFICANT OF
HIS SKILL AND OF HIS AUTHORITY OVER THE SAILORS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
NOW I SAID EVERY ART HAS AN INTEREST
CERTAINLY
FOR WHICH THE ART HAS TO CONSIDER AND PROVIDE
YES THAT IS THE AIM OF ART
AND THE INTEREST OF ANY ART IS THE PERFECTION OF IT THIS AND NOTHING
ELSE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN WHAT I MAY ILLUSTRATE NEGATIVELY BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE BODY
SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO ASK ME WHETHER THE BODY IS SELF SUFFICING OR HAS
WANTS I SHOULD REPLY CERTAINLY THE BODY HAS WANTS FOR THE BODY MAY
BE ILL AND REQUIRE TO BE CURED AND HAS THEREFORE INTERESTS TO WHICH
THE ART OF MEDICINE MINISTERS AND THIS IS THE ORIGIN AND INTENTION OF
MEDICINE AS YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE
AM I NOT RIGHT
QUITE RIGHT HE REPLIED
BUT IS THE ART OF MEDICINE OR ANY OTHER ART FAULTY OR DEFICIENT IN ANY
QUALITY IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE EYE MAY BE DEFICIENT IN SIGHT OR THE
EAR FAIL OF HEARING AND THEREFORE REQUIRES ANOTHER ART TO PROVIDE
FOR THE INTERESTS OF SEEING AND HEARING HAS ART IN ITSELF I SAY ANY
SIMILAR LIABILITY TO FAULT OR DEFECT AND DOES EVERY ART REQUIRE ANOTHER
SUPPLEMENTARY ART TO PROVIDE FOR ITS INTERESTS AND THAT ANOTHER AND
ANOTHER WITHOUT END OR HAVE THE ARTS TO LOOK ONLY AFTER THEIR
OWN INTERESTS OR HAVE THEY NO NEED EITHER OF THEMSELVES OR OF
ANOTHER HAVING NO FAULTS OR DEFECTS THEY HAVE NO NEED TO CORRECT
THEM EITHER BY THE EXERCISE OF THEIR OWN ART OR OF ANY OTHER THEY HAVE
ONLY TO CONSIDER THE INTEREST OF THEIR SUBJECT MATTER
FOR EVERY ART
REMAINS PURE AND FAULTLESS WHILE REMAINING TRUE THAT IS TO SAY WHILE
PERFECT AND UNIMPAIRED
TAKE THE WORDS IN YOUR PRECISE SENSE AND TELL
ME WHETHER I AM NOT RIGHT
YES CLEARLY
THEN MEDICINE DOES NOT CONSIDER THE INTEREST OF MEDICINE BUT THE
INTEREST OF THE BODY
TRUE HE SAID
NOR DOES THE ART OF HORSEMANSHIP CONSIDER THE INTERESTS OF THE ART OF
HORSEMANSHIP BUT THE INTERESTS OF THE HORSE NEITHER DO ANY OTHER ARTS
CARE FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEY HAVE NO NEEDS THEY CARE ONLY FOR THAT
WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR ART
TRUE HE SAID
BUT SURELY THRASYMACHUS THE ARTS ARE THE SUPERIORS AND RULERS OF THEIR
OWN SUBJECTS
TO THIS HE ASSENTED WITH A GOOD DEAL OF RELUCTANCE
THEN I SAID NO SCIENCE OR ART CONSIDERS OR ENJOINS THE INTEREST OF THE
STRONGER OR SUPERIOR BUT ONLY THE INTEREST OF THE SUBJECT AND WEAKER
HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO CONTEST THIS PROPOSITION ALSO BUT FINALLY
ACQUIESCED
THEN I CONTINUED NO PHYSICIAN IN SO FAR AS HE IS A PHYSICIAN
CONSIDERS HIS OWN GOOD IN WHAT HE PRESCRIBES BUT THE GOOD OF HIS
PATIENT FOR THE TRUE PHYSICIAN IS ALSO A RULER HAVING THE HUMAN BODY AS
A SUBJECT AND IS NOT A MERE MONEY MAKER THAT HAS BEEN ADMITTED
YES
AND THE PILOT LIKEWISE IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM IS A RULER OF
SAILORS AND NOT A MERE SAILOR
THAT HAS BEEN ADMITTED
AND SUCH A PILOT AND RULER WILL PROVIDE AND PRESCRIBE FOR THE INTEREST
OF THE SAILOR WHO IS UNDER HIM AND NOT FOR HIS OWN OR THE RULER'S
INTEREST
HE GAVE A RELUCTANT 'YES
THEN I SAID THRASYMACHUS THERE IS NO ONE IN ANY RULE WHO IN SO FAR
AS HE IS A RULER CONSIDERS OR ENJOINS WHAT IS FOR HIS OWN INTEREST BUT
ALWAYS WHAT IS FOR THE INTEREST OF HIS SUBJECT OR SUITABLE TO HIS ART
TO THAT HE LOOKS AND THAT ALONE HE CONSIDERS IN EVERYTHING WHICH HE
SAYS AND DOES
WHEN WE HAD GOT TO THIS POINT IN THE ARGUMENT AND EVERY ONE SAW THAT
THE DEFINITION OF JUSTICE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY UPSET THRASYMACHUS
INSTEAD OF REPLYING TO ME SAID TELL ME SOCRATES HAVE YOU GOT A
NURSE
WHY DO YOU ASK SUCH A QUESTION I SAID WHEN YOU OUGHT RATHER TO BE
ANSWERING
BECAUSE SHE LEAVES YOU TO SNIVEL AND NEVER WIPES YOUR NOSE SHE HAS NOT
EVEN TAUGHT YOU TO KNOW THE SHEPHERD FROM THE SHEEP
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT I REPLIED
BECAUSE YOU FANCY THAT THE SHEPHERD OR NEATHERD FATTENS OR TENDS THE
SHEEP OR OXEN WITH A VIEW TO THEIR OWN GOOD AND NOT TO THE GOOD OF
HIMSELF OR HIS MASTER AND YOU FURTHER IMAGINE THAT THE RULERS OF
STATES IF THEY ARE TRUE RULERS NEVER THINK OF THEIR SUBJECTS AS SHEEP
AND THAT THEY ARE NOT STUDYING THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE DAY AND NIGHT
OH
NO AND SO ENTIRELY ASTRAY ARE YOU IN YOUR IDEAS ABOUT THE JUST AND
UNJUST AS NOT EVEN TO KNOW THAT JUSTICE AND THE JUST ARE IN REALITY
ANOTHER'S GOOD THAT IS TO SAY THE INTEREST OF THE RULER AND STRONGER
AND THE LOSS OF THE SUBJECT AND SERVANT AND INJUSTICE THE OPPOSITE FOR
THE UNJUST IS LORD OVER THE TRULY SIMPLE AND JUST HE IS THE STRONGER
AND HIS SUBJECTS DO WHAT IS FOR HIS INTEREST AND MINISTER TO HIS
HAPPINESS WHICH IS VERY FAR FROM BEING THEIR OWN
CONSIDER FURTHER
MOST FOOLISH SOCRATES THAT THE JUST IS ALWAYS A LOSER IN COMPARISON
WITH THE UNJUST
FIRST OF ALL IN PRIVATE CONTRACTS WHEREVER THE UNJUST
IS THE PARTNER OF THE JUST YOU WILL FIND THAT WHEN THE PARTNERSHIP IS
DISSOLVED THE UNJUST MAN HAS ALWAYS MORE AND THE JUST LESS
SECONDLY
IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH THE STATE WHEN THERE IS AN INCOME TAX THE JUST
MAN WILL PAY MORE AND THE UNJUST LESS ON THE SAME AMOUNT OF INCOME
AND WHEN THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE RECEIVED THE ONE GAINS NOTHING AND THE
OTHER MUCH
OBSERVE ALSO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY TAKE AN OFFICE THERE IS
THE JUST MAN NEGLECTING HIS AFFAIRS AND PERHAPS SUFFERING OTHER LOSSES
AND GETTING NOTHING OUT OF THE PUBLIC BECAUSE HE IS JUST MOREOVER HE
IS HATED BY HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCE FOR REFUSING TO SERVE THEM IN
UNLAWFUL WAYS
BUT ALL THIS IS REVERSED IN THE CASE OF THE UNJUST MAN
I AM SPEAKING AS BEFORE OF INJUSTICE ON A LARGE SCALE IN WHICH THE
ADVANTAGE OF THE UNJUST IS MOST APPARENT AND MY MEANING WILL BE MOST
CLEARLY SEEN IF WE TURN TO THAT HIGHEST FORM OF INJUSTICE IN WHICH THE
CRIMINAL IS THE HAPPIEST OF MEN AND THE SUFFERERS OR THOSE WHO REFUSE
TO DO INJUSTICE ARE THE MOST MISERABLE THAT IS TO SAY TYRANNY WHICH BY
FRAUD AND FORCE TAKES AWAY THE PROPERTY OF OTHERS NOT LITTLE BY LITTLE
BUT WHOLESALE COMPREHENDING IN ONE THINGS SACRED AS WELL AS PROFANE
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FOR WHICH ACTS OF WRONG IF HE WERE DETECTED
PERPETRATING ANY ONE OF THEM SINGLY HE WOULD BE PUNISHED AND INCUR
GREAT DISGRACE THEY WHO DO SUCH WRONG IN PARTICULAR CASES ARE CALLED
ROBBERS OF TEMPLES AND MAN STEALERS AND BURGLARS AND SWINDLERS AND
THIEVES
BUT WHEN A MAN BESIDES TAKING AWAY THE MONEY OF THE CITIZENS
HAS MADE SLAVES OF THEM THEN INSTEAD OF THESE NAMES OF REPROACH HE IS
TERMED HAPPY AND BLESSED NOT ONLY BY THE CITIZENS BUT BY ALL WHO
HEAR OF HIS HAVING ACHIEVED THE CONSUMMATION OF INJUSTICE
FOR MANKIND
CENSURE INJUSTICE FEARING THAT THEY MAY BE THE VICTIMS OF IT AND NOT
BECAUSE THEY SHRINK FROM COMMITTING IT
AND THUS AS I HAVE SHOWN
SOCRATES INJUSTICE WHEN ON A SUFFICIENT SCALE HAS MORE STRENGTH AND
FREEDOM AND MASTERY THAN JUSTICE AND AS I SAID AT FIRST JUSTICE IS
THE INTEREST OF THE STRONGER WHEREAS INJUSTICE IS A MAN'S OWN PROFIT
AND INTEREST
THRASYMACHUS WHEN HE HAD THUS SPOKEN HAVING LIKE A BATH MAN DELUGED
OUR EARS WITH HIS WORDS HAD A MIND TO GO AWAY
BUT THE COMPANY
WOULD NOT LET HIM THEY INSISTED THAT HE SHOULD REMAIN AND DEFEND HIS
POSITION AND I MYSELF ADDED MY OWN HUMBLE REQUEST THAT HE WOULD NOT
LEAVE US
THRASYMACHUS I SAID TO HIM EXCELLENT MAN HOW SUGGESTIVE
ARE YOUR REMARKS AND ARE YOU GOING TO RUN AWAY BEFORE YOU HAVE FAIRLY
TAUGHT OR LEARNED WHETHER THEY ARE TRUE OR NOT IS THE ATTEMPT TO
DETERMINE THE WAY OF MAN'S LIFE SO SMALL A MATTER IN YOUR EYES TO
DETERMINE HOW LIFE MAY BE PASSED BY EACH ONE OF US TO THE GREATEST
ADVANTAGE
AND DO I DIFFER FROM YOU HE SAID AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENQUIRY
YOU APPEAR RATHER I REPLIED TO HAVE NO CARE OR THOUGHT ABOUT US
THRASYMACHUS WHETHER WE LIVE BETTER OR WORSE FROM NOT KNOWING WHAT YOU
SAY YOU KNOW IS TO YOU A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
PRITHEE FRIEND
DO NOT KEEP YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO YOURSELF WE ARE A LARGE PARTY AND ANY
BENEFIT WHICH YOU CONFER UPON US WILL BE AMPLY REWARDED
FOR MY OWN
PART I OPENLY DECLARE THAT I AM NOT CONVINCED AND THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE
INJUSTICE TO BE MORE GAINFUL THAN JUSTICE EVEN IF UNCONTROLLED AND
ALLOWED TO HAVE FREE PLAY
FOR GRANTING THAT THERE MAY BE AN UNJUST
MAN WHO IS ABLE TO COMMIT INJUSTICE EITHER BY FRAUD OR FORCE STILL THIS
DOES NOT CONVINCE ME OF THE SUPERIOR ADVANTAGE OF INJUSTICE AND THERE
MAY BE OTHERS WHO ARE IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT WITH MYSELF
PERHAPS WE
MAY BE WRONG IF SO YOU IN YOUR WISDOM SHOULD CONVINCE US THAT WE ARE
MISTAKEN IN PREFERRING JUSTICE TO INJUSTICE
AND HOW AM I TO CONVINCE YOU HE SAID IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY CONVINCED
BY WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID WHAT MORE CAN I DO FOR YOU WOULD YOU HAVE ME
PUT THE PROOF BODILY INTO YOUR SOULS
HEAVEN FORBID I SAID I WOULD ONLY ASK YOU TO BE CONSISTENT OR IF YOU
CHANGE CHANGE OPENLY AND LET THERE BE NO DECEPTION
FOR I MUST REMARK
THRASYMACHUS IF YOU WILL RECALL WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT ALTHOUGH
YOU BEGAN BY DEFINING THE TRUE PHYSICIAN IN AN EXACT SENSE YOU DID NOT
OBSERVE A LIKE EXACTNESS WHEN SPEAKING OF THE SHEPHERD YOU THOUGHT THAT
THE SHEPHERD AS A SHEPHERD TENDS THE SHEEP NOT WITH A VIEW TO THEIR OWN
GOOD BUT LIKE A MERE DINER OR BANQUETTER WITH A VIEW TO THE PLEASURES
OF THE TABLE OR AGAIN AS A TRADER FOR SALE IN THE MARKET AND NOT AS
A SHEPHERD
YET SURELY THE ART OF THE SHEPHERD IS CONCERNED ONLY WITH
THE GOOD OF HIS SUBJECTS HE HAS ONLY TO PROVIDE THE BEST FOR THEM
SINCE THE PERFECTION OF THE ART IS ALREADY ENSURED WHENEVER ALL THE
REQUIREMENTS OF IT ARE SATISFIED
AND THAT WAS WHAT I WAS SAYING JUST
NOW ABOUT THE RULER
I CONCEIVED THAT THE ART OF THE RULER CONSIDERED
AS RULER WHETHER IN A STATE OR IN PRIVATE LIFE COULD ONLY REGARD THE
GOOD OF HIS FLOCK OR SUBJECTS WHEREAS YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT THE RULERS
IN STATES THAT IS TO SAY THE TRUE RULERS LIKE BEING IN AUTHORITY
THINK NAY I AM SURE OF IT
THEN WHY IN THE CASE OF LESSER OFFICES DO MEN NEVER TAKE THEM WILLINGLY
WITHOUT PAYMENT UNLESS UNDER THE IDEA THAT THEY GOVERN FOR THE
ADVANTAGE NOT OF THEMSELVES BUT OF OTHERS LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION
ARE NOT THE SEVERAL ARTS DIFFERENT BY REASON OF THEIR EACH HAVING A
SEPARATE FUNCTION AND MY DEAR ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND DO SAY WHAT YOU
THINK THAT WE MAY MAKE A LITTLE PROGRESS
YES THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE HE REPLIED
AND EACH ART GIVES US A PARTICULAR GOOD AND NOT MERELY A GENERAL
ONE MEDICINE FOR EXAMPLE GIVES US HEALTH NAVIGATION SAFETY AT SEA
AND SO ON
YES HE SAID
AND THE ART OF PAYMENT HAS THE SPECIAL FUNCTION OF GIVING PAY BUT WE DO
NOT CONFUSE THIS WITH OTHER ARTS ANY MORE THAN THE ART OF THE PILOT IS
TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE ART OF MEDICINE BECAUSE THE HEALTH OF THE PILOT
MAY BE IMPROVED BY A SEA VOYAGE
YOU WOULD NOT BE INCLINED TO SAY WOULD
YOU THAT NAVIGATION IS THE ART OF MEDICINE AT LEAST IF WE ARE TO ADOPT
YOUR EXACT USE OF LANGUAGE
CERTAINLY NOT
OR BECAUSE A MAN IS IN GOOD HEALTH WHEN HE RECEIVES PAY YOU WOULD NOT
SAY THAT THE ART OF PAYMENT IS MEDICINE
I SHOULD NOT
NOR WOULD YOU SAY THAT MEDICINE IS THE ART OF RECEIVING PAY BECAUSE A
MAN TAKES FEES WHEN HE IS ENGAGED IN HEALING
CERTAINLY NOT
AND WE HAVE ADMITTED I SAID THAT THE GOOD OF EACH ART IS SPECIALLY
CONFINED TO THE ART
YES
THEN IF THERE BE ANY GOOD WHICH ALL ARTISTS HAVE IN COMMON THAT IS TO
BE ATTRIBUTED TO SOMETHING OF WHICH THEY ALL HAVE THE COMMON USE
TRUE HE REPLIED
AND WHEN THE ARTIST IS BENEFITED BY RECEIVING PAY THE ADVANTAGE IS
GAINED BY AN ADDITIONAL USE OF THE ART OF PAY WHICH IS NOT THE ART
PROFESSED BY HIM
HE GAVE A RELUCTANT ASSENT TO THIS
THEN THE PAY IS NOT DERIVED BY THE SEVERAL ARTISTS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE
ARTS
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WHILE THE ART OF MEDICINE GIVES HEALTH AND
THE ART OF THE BUILDER BUILDS A HOUSE ANOTHER ART ATTENDS THEM WHICH
IS THE ART OF PAY
THE VARIOUS ARTS MAY BE DOING THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND
BENEFITING THAT OVER WHICH THEY PRESIDE BUT WOULD THE ARTIST RECEIVE
ANY BENEFIT FROM HIS ART UNLESS HE WERE PAID AS WELL
I SUPPOSE NOT
BUT DOES HE THEREFORE CONFER NO BENEFIT WHEN HE WORKS FOR NOTHING
CERTAINLY HE CONFERS A BENEFIT
THEN NOW THRASYMACHUS THERE IS NO LONGER ANY DOUBT THAT NEITHER ARTS
NOR GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS BUT AS WE WERE BEFORE
SAYING THEY RULE AND PROVIDE FOR THE INTERESTS OF THEIR SUBJECTS WHO
ARE THE WEAKER AND NOT THE STRONGER TO THEIR GOOD THEY ATTEND AND
NOT TO THE GOOD OF THE SUPERIOR
AND THIS IS THE REASON MY DEAR
THRASYMACHUS WHY AS I WAS JUST NOW SAYING NO ONE IS WILLING TO
GOVERN BECAUSE NO ONE LIKES TO TAKE IN HAND THE REFORMATION OF EVILS
WHICH ARE NOT HIS CONCERN WITHOUT REMUNERATION
FOR IN THE EXECUTION OF
HIS WORK AND IN GIVING HIS ORDERS TO ANOTHER THE TRUE ARTIST DOES NOT
REGARD HIS OWN INTEREST BUT ALWAYS THAT OF HIS SUBJECTS AND THEREFORE
IN ORDER THAT RULERS MAY BE WILLING TO RULE THEY MUST BE PAID IN ONE OF
THREE MODES OF PAYMENT MONEY OR HONOUR OR A PENALTY FOR REFUSING
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOCRATES SAID GLAUCON
THE FIRST TWO MODES OF PAYMENT
ARE INTELLIGIBLE ENOUGH BUT WHAT THE PENALTY IS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR
HOW A PENALTY CAN BE A PAYMENT
YOU MEAN THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THIS PAYMENT WHICH TO
THE BEST MEN IS THE GREAT INDUCEMENT TO RULE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT
AMBITION AND AVARICE ARE HELD TO BE AS INDEED THEY ARE A DISGRACE
VERY TRUE
AND FOR THIS REASON I SAID MONEY AND HONOUR HAVE NO ATTRACTION FOR
THEM GOOD MEN DO NOT WISH TO BE OPENLY DEMANDING PAYMENT FOR GOVERNING
AND SO TO GET THE NAME OF HIRELINGS NOR BY SECRETLY HELPING THEMSELVES
OUT OF THE PUBLIC REVENUES TO GET THE NAME OF THIEVES
AND NOT BEING
AMBITIOUS THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT HONOUR
WHEREFORE NECESSITY MUST BE
LAID UPON THEM AND THEY MUST BE INDUCED TO SERVE FROM THE FEAR OF
PUNISHMENT
AND THIS AS I IMAGINE IS THE REASON WHY THE FORWARDNESS
TO TAKE OFFICE INSTEAD OF WAITING TO BE COMPELLED HAS BEEN DEEMED
DISHONOURABLE
NOW THE WORST PART OF THE PUNISHMENT IS THAT HE WHO
REFUSES TO RULE IS LIABLE TO BE RULED BY ONE WHO IS WORSE THAN HIMSELF
AND THE FEAR OF THIS AS I CONCEIVE INDUCES THE GOOD TO TAKE OFFICE
NOT BECAUSE THEY WOULD BUT BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HELP NOT UNDER THE IDEA
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE ANY BENEFIT OR ENJOYMENT THEMSELVES BUT AS
A NECESSITY AND BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO COMMIT THE TASK OF RULING
TO ANY ONE WHO IS BETTER THAN THEMSELVES OR INDEED AS GOOD
FOR THERE
IS REASON TO THINK THAT IF A CITY WERE COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF GOOD MEN
THEN TO AVOID OFFICE WOULD BE AS MUCH AN OBJECT OF CONTENTION AS TO
OBTAIN OFFICE IS AT PRESENT THEN WE SHOULD HAVE PLAIN PROOF THAT THE
TRUE RULER IS NOT MEANT BY NATURE TO REGARD HIS OWN INTEREST BUT THAT
OF HIS SUBJECTS AND EVERY ONE WHO KNEW THIS WOULD CHOOSE RATHER TO
RECEIVE A BENEFIT FROM ANOTHER THAN TO HAVE THE TROUBLE OF CONFERRING
ONE
SO FAR AM I FROM AGREEING WITH THRASYMACHUS THAT JUSTICE IS THE
INTEREST OF THE STRONGER
THIS LATTER QUESTION NEED NOT BE FURTHER
DISCUSSED AT PRESENT BUT WHEN THRASYMACHUS SAYS THAT THE LIFE OF THE
UNJUST IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS THAN THAT OF THE JUST HIS NEW STATEMENT
APPEARS TO ME TO BE OF A FAR MORE SERIOUS CHARACTER
WHICH OF US HAS
SPOKEN TRULY AND WHICH SORT OF LIFE GLAUCON DO YOU PREFER
I FOR MY PART DEEM THE LIFE OF THE JUST TO BE THE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS HE
ANSWERED
DID YOU HEAR ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF THE UNJUST WHICH THRASYMACHUS WAS
REHEARSING
YES I HEARD HIM HE REPLIED BUT HE HAS NOT CONVINCED ME
THEN SHALL WE TRY TO FIND SOME WAY OF CONVINCING HIM IF WE CAN THAT HE
IS SAYING WHAT IS NOT TRUE
MOST CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
IF I SAID HE MAKES A SET SPEECH AND WE MAKE ANOTHER RECOUNTING ALL THE
ADVANTAGES OF BEING JUST AND HE ANSWERS AND WE REJOIN THERE MUST BE A
NUMBERING AND MEASURING OF THE GOODS WHICH ARE CLAIMED ON EITHER SIDE
AND IN THE END WE SHALL WANT JUDGES TO DECIDE BUT IF WE PROCEED IN OUR
ENQUIRY AS WE LATELY DID BY MAKING ADMISSIONS TO ONE ANOTHER WE SHALL
UNITE THE OFFICES OF JUDGE AND ADVOCATE IN OUR OWN PERSONS
VERY GOOD HE SAID
AND WHICH METHOD DO I UNDERSTAND YOU TO PREFER I SAID
THAT WHICH YOU PROPOSE
WELL THEN THRASYMACHUS I SAID SUPPOSE YOU BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND
ANSWER ME
YOU SAY THAT PERFECT INJUSTICE IS MORE GAINFUL THAN PERFECT
JUSTICE
YES THAT IS WHAT I SAY AND I HAVE GIVEN YOU MY REASONS
AND WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ABOUT THEM WOULD YOU CALL ONE OF THEM VIRTUE AND
THE OTHER VICE
CERTAINLY
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD CALL JUSTICE VIRTUE AND INJUSTICE VICE
WHAT A CHARMING NOTION SO LIKELY TOO SEEING THAT I AFFIRM INJUSTICE TO
BE PROFITABLE AND JUSTICE NOT
WHAT ELSE THEN WOULD YOU SAY
THE OPPOSITE HE REPLIED
AND WOULD YOU CALL JUSTICE VICE
NO I WOULD RATHER SAY SUBLIME SIMPLICITY
THEN WOULD YOU CALL INJUSTICE MALIGNITY
NO I WOULD RATHER SAY DISCRETION
AND DO THE UNJUST APPEAR TO YOU TO BE WISE AND GOOD
YES HE SAID AT ANY RATE THOSE OF THEM WHO ARE ABLE TO BE PERFECTLY
UNJUST AND WHO HAVE THE POWER OF SUBDUING STATES AND NATIONS BUT
PERHAPS YOU IMAGINE ME TO BE TALKING OF CUTPURSES
EVEN THIS PROFESSION
IF UNDETECTED HAS ADVANTAGES THOUGH THEY ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH
THOSE OF WHICH I WAS JUST NOW SPEAKING
I DO NOT THINK THAT I MISAPPREHEND YOUR MEANING THRASYMACHUS I
REPLIED BUT STILL I CANNOT HEAR WITHOUT AMAZEMENT THAT YOU CLASS
INJUSTICE WITH WISDOM AND VIRTUE AND JUSTICE WITH THE OPPOSITE
CERTAINLY I DO SO CLASS THEM
NOW I SAID YOU ARE ON MORE SUBSTANTIAL AND ALMOST UNANSWERABLE GROUND
FOR IF THE INJUSTICE WHICH YOU WERE MAINTAINING TO BE PROFITABLE HAD
BEEN ADMITTED BY YOU AS BY OTHERS TO BE VICE AND DEFORMITY AN ANSWER
MIGHT HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO YOU ON RECEIVED PRINCIPLES BUT NOW I PERCEIVE
THAT YOU WILL CALL INJUSTICE HONOURABLE AND STRONG AND TO THE UNJUST
YOU WILL ATTRIBUTE ALL THE QUALITIES WHICH WERE ATTRIBUTED BY US BEFORE
TO THE JUST SEEING THAT YOU DO NOT HESITATE TO RANK INJUSTICE WITH
WISDOM AND VIRTUE
YOU HAVE GUESSED MOST INFALLIBLY HE REPLIED
THEN I CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT TO SHRINK FROM GOING THROUGH WITH THE
ARGUMENT SO LONG AS I HAVE REASON TO THINK THAT YOU THRASYMACHUS ARE
SPEAKING YOUR REAL MIND FOR I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE NOW IN EARNEST
AND ARE NOT AMUSING YOURSELF AT OUR EXPENSE
I MAY BE IN EARNEST OR NOT BUT WHAT IS THAT TO YOU TO REFUTE THE
ARGUMENT IS YOUR BUSINESS
VERY TRUE I SAID THAT IS WHAT I HAVE TO DO BUT WILL YOU BE SO GOOD
AS ANSWER YET ONE MORE QUESTION DOES THE JUST MAN TRY TO GAIN ANY
ADVANTAGE OVER THE JUST
FAR OTHERWISE IF HE DID HE WOULD NOT BE THE SIMPLE AMUSING CREATURE
WHICH HE IS
AND WOULD HE TRY TO GO BEYOND JUST ACTION
HE WOULD NOT
AND HOW WOULD HE REGARD THE ATTEMPT TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE
UNJUST WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED BY HIM AS JUST OR UNJUST
HE WOULD THINK IT JUST AND WOULD TRY TO GAIN THE ADVANTAGE BUT HE
WOULD NOT BE ABLE
WHETHER HE WOULD OR WOULD NOT BE ABLE I SAID IS NOT TO THE POINT
MY
QUESTION IS ONLY WHETHER THE JUST MAN WHILE REFUSING TO HAVE MORE THAN
ANOTHER JUST MAN WOULD WISH AND CLAIM TO HAVE MORE THAN THE UNJUST
YES HE WOULD
AND WHAT OF THE UNJUST DOES HE CLAIM TO HAVE MORE THAN THE JUST MAN AND
TO DO MORE THAN IS JUST
OF COURSE HE SAID FOR HE CLAIMS TO HAVE MORE THAN ALL MEN
AND THE UNJUST MAN WILL STRIVE AND STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN MORE THAN THE
UNJUST MAN OR ACTION IN ORDER THAT HE MAY HAVE MORE THAN ALL
TRUE
WE MAY PUT THE MATTER THUS I SAID THE JUST DOES NOT DESIRE MORE THAN
HIS LIKE BUT MORE THAN HIS UNLIKE WHEREAS THE UNJUST DESIRES MORE THAN
BOTH HIS LIKE AND HIS UNLIKE
NOTHING HE SAID CAN BE BETTER THAN THAT STATEMENT
AND THE UNJUST IS GOOD AND WISE AND THE JUST IS NEITHER
GOOD AGAIN HE SAID
AND IS NOT THE UNJUST LIKE THE WISE AND GOOD AND THE JUST UNLIKE THEM
OF COURSE HE SAID HE WHO IS OF A CERTAIN NATURE IS LIKE THOSE WHO ARE
OF A CERTAIN NATURE HE WHO IS NOT NOT
EACH OF THEM I SAID IS SUCH AS HIS LIKE IS
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
VERY GOOD THRASYMACHUS I SAID AND NOW TO TAKE THE CASE OF THE ARTS
YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT ONE MAN IS A MUSICIAN AND ANOTHER NOT A MUSICIAN
YES
AND WHICH IS WISE AND WHICH IS FOOLISH
CLEARLY THE MUSICIAN IS WISE AND HE WHO IS NOT A MUSICIAN IS FOOLISH
AND HE IS GOOD IN AS FAR AS HE IS WISE AND BAD IN AS FAR AS HE IS
FOOLISH
YES
AND YOU WOULD SAY THE SAME SORT OF THING OF THE PHYSICIAN
YES
AND DO YOU THINK MY EXCELLENT FRIEND THAT A MUSICIAN WHEN HE ADJUSTS
THE LYRE WOULD DESIRE OR CLAIM TO EXCEED OR GO BEYOND A MUSICIAN IN THE
TIGHTENING AND LOOSENING THE STRINGS
I DO NOT THINK THAT HE WOULD
BUT HE WOULD CLAIM TO EXCEED THE NON MUSICIAN
OF COURSE
AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY OF THE PHYSICIAN IN PRESCRIBING MEATS AND DRINKS
WOULD HE WISH TO GO BEYOND ANOTHER PHYSICIAN OR BEYOND THE PRACTICE OF
MEDICINE
HE WOULD NOT
BUT HE WOULD WISH TO GO BEYOND THE NON PHYSICIAN
YES
AND ABOUT KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE IN GENERAL SEE WHETHER YOU THINK THAT
ANY MAN WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE EVER WOULD WISH TO HAVE THE CHOICE OF SAYING
OR DOING MORE THAN ANOTHER MAN WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE
WOULD HE NOT RATHER
SAY OR DO THE SAME AS HIS LIKE IN THE SAME CASE
THAT I SUPPOSE CAN HARDLY BE DENIED
AND WHAT OF THE IGNORANT WOULD HE NOT DESIRE TO HAVE MORE THAN EITHER
THE KNOWING OR THE IGNORANT
I DARE SAY
AND THE KNOWING IS WISE
YES
AND THE WISE IS GOOD
TRUE
THEN THE WISE AND GOOD WILL NOT DESIRE TO GAIN MORE THAN HIS LIKE BUT
MORE THAN HIS UNLIKE AND OPPOSITE
I SUPPOSE SO
WHEREAS THE BAD AND IGNORANT WILL DESIRE TO GAIN MORE THAN BOTH
YES
BUT DID WE NOT SAY THRASYMACHUS THAT THE UNJUST GOES BEYOND BOTH HIS
LIKE AND UNLIKE WERE NOT THESE YOUR WORDS
THEY WERE
AND YOU ALSO SAID THAT THE JUST WILL NOT GO BEYOND HIS LIKE BUT HIS
UNLIKE
YES
THEN THE JUST IS LIKE THE WISE AND GOOD AND THE UNJUST LIKE THE EVIL
AND IGNORANT
THAT IS THE INFERENCE
AND EACH OF THEM IS SUCH AS HIS LIKE IS
THAT WAS ADMITTED
THEN THE JUST HAS TURNED OUT TO BE WISE AND GOOD AND THE UNJUST EVIL AND
IGNORANT
THRASYMACHUS MADE ALL THESE ADMISSIONS NOT FLUENTLY AS I REPEAT
THEM BUT WITH EXTREME RELUCTANCE IT WAS A HOT SUMMER'S DAY AND THE
PERSPIRATION POURED FROM HIM IN TORRENTS AND THEN I SAW WHAT I HAD
NEVER SEEN BEFORE THRASYMACHUS BLUSHING
AS WE WERE NOW AGREED THAT
JUSTICE WAS VIRTUE AND WISDOM AND INJUSTICE VICE AND IGNORANCE I
PROCEEDED TO ANOTHER POINT
WELL I SAID THRASYMACHUS THAT MATTER IS NOW SETTLED BUT WERE WE NOT
ALSO SAYING THAT INJUSTICE HAD STRENGTH DO YOU REMEMBER
YES I REMEMBER HE SAID BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I APPROVE OF WHAT YOU
ARE SAYING OR HAVE NO ANSWER IF HOWEVER I WERE TO ANSWER YOU WOULD BE
QUITE CERTAIN TO ACCUSE ME OF HARANGUING THEREFORE EITHER PERMIT ME TO
HAVE MY SAY OUT OR IF YOU WOULD RATHER ASK DO SO AND I WILL ANSWER
'VERY GOOD AS THEY SAY TO STORY TELLING OLD WOMEN AND WILL NOD 'YES'
AND 'NO
CERTAINLY NOT I SAID IF CONTRARY TO YOUR REAL OPINION
YES HE SAID I WILL TO PLEASE YOU SINCE YOU WILL NOT LET ME SPEAK
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU HAVE
NOTHING IN THE WORLD I SAID AND IF YOU ARE SO DISPOSED I WILL ASK AND
YOU SHALL ANSWER
PROCEED
THEN I WILL REPEAT THE QUESTION WHICH I ASKED BEFORE IN ORDER THAT
OUR EXAMINATION OF THE RELATIVE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE MAY BE
CARRIED ON REGULARLY
A STATEMENT WAS MADE THAT INJUSTICE IS STRONGER
AND MORE POWERFUL THAN JUSTICE BUT NOW JUSTICE HAVING BEEN IDENTIFIED
WITH WISDOM AND VIRTUE IS EASILY SHOWN TO BE STRONGER THAN INJUSTICE
IF INJUSTICE IS IGNORANCE THIS CAN NO LONGER BE QUESTIONED BY ANY ONE
BUT I WANT TO VIEW THE MATTER THRASYMACHUS IN A DIFFERENT WAY YOU
WOULD NOT DENY THAT A STATE MAY BE UNJUST AND MAY BE UNJUSTLY ATTEMPTING
TO ENSLAVE OTHER STATES OR MAY HAVE ALREADY ENSLAVED THEM AND MAY BE
HOLDING MANY OF THEM IN SUBJECTION
TRUE HE REPLIED AND I WILL ADD THAT THE BEST AND MOST PERFECTLY UNJUST
STATE WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO DO SO
I KNOW I SAID THAT SUCH WAS YOUR POSITION BUT WHAT I WOULD FURTHER
CONSIDER IS WHETHER THIS POWER WHICH IS POSSESSED BY THE SUPERIOR STATE
CAN EXIST OR BE EXERCISED WITHOUT JUSTICE OR ONLY WITH JUSTICE
IF YOU ARE RIGHT IN YOUR VIEW AND JUSTICE IS WISDOM THEN ONLY WITH
JUSTICE BUT IF I AM RIGHT THEN WITHOUT JUSTICE
I AM DELIGHTED THRASYMACHUS TO SEE YOU NOT ONLY NODDING ASSENT AND
DISSENT BUT MAKING ANSWERS WHICH ARE QUITE EXCELLENT
THAT IS OUT OF CIVILITY TO YOU HE REPLIED
YOU ARE VERY KIND I SAID AND WOULD YOU HAVE THE GOODNESS ALSO TO
INFORM ME WHETHER YOU THINK THAT A STATE OR AN ARMY OR A BAND OF
ROBBERS AND THIEVES OR ANY OTHER GANG OF EVIL DOERS COULD ACT AT ALL IF
THEY INJURED ONE ANOTHER
NO INDEED HE SAID THEY COULD NOT
BUT IF THEY ABSTAINED FROM INJURING ONE ANOTHER THEN THEY MIGHT ACT
TOGETHER BETTER
YES
AND THIS IS BECAUSE INJUSTICE CREATES DIVISIONS AND HATREDS AND
FIGHTING AND JUSTICE IMPARTS HARMONY AND FRIENDSHIP IS NOT THAT TRUE
THRASYMACHUS
I AGREE HE SAID BECAUSE I DO NOT WISH TO QUARREL WITH YOU
HOW GOOD OF YOU I SAID BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW ALSO WHETHER
INJUSTICE HAVING THIS TENDENCY TO AROUSE HATRED WHEREVER EXISTING
AMONG SLAVES OR AMONG FREEMEN WILL NOT MAKE THEM HATE ONE ANOTHER AND
SET THEM AT VARIANCE AND RENDER THEM INCAPABLE OF COMMON ACTION
CERTAINLY
AND EVEN IF INJUSTICE BE FOUND IN TWO ONLY WILL THEY NOT QUARREL AND
FIGHT AND BECOME ENEMIES TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE JUST
THEY WILL
AND SUPPOSE INJUSTICE ABIDING IN A SINGLE PERSON WOULD YOUR WISDOM SAY
THAT SHE LOSES OR THAT SHE RETAINS HER NATURAL POWER
LET US ASSUME THAT SHE RETAINS HER POWER
YET IS NOT THE POWER WHICH INJUSTICE EXERCISES OF SUCH A NATURE THAT
WHEREVER SHE TAKES UP HER ABODE WHETHER IN A CITY IN AN ARMY IN A
FAMILY OR IN ANY OTHER BODY THAT BODY IS TO BEGIN WITH RENDERED
INCAPABLE OF UNITED ACTION BY REASON OF SEDITION AND DISTRACTION AND
DOES IT NOT BECOME ITS OWN ENEMY AND AT VARIANCE WITH ALL THAT OPPOSES
IT AND WITH THE JUST IS NOT THIS THE CASE
YES CERTAINLY
AND IS NOT INJUSTICE EQUALLY FATAL WHEN EXISTING IN A SINGLE PERSON IN
THE FIRST PLACE RENDERING HIM INCAPABLE OF ACTION BECAUSE HE IS NOT
AT UNITY WITH HIMSELF AND IN THE SECOND PLACE MAKING HIM AN ENEMY TO
HIMSELF AND THE JUST IS NOT THAT TRUE THRASYMACHUS
YES
AND O MY FRIEND I SAID SURELY THE GODS ARE JUST
GRANTED THAT THEY ARE
BUT IF SO THE UNJUST WILL BE THE ENEMY OF THE GODS AND THE JUST WILL
BE THEIR FRIEND
FEAST AWAY IN TRIUMPH AND TAKE YOUR FILL OF THE ARGUMENT I WILL NOT
OPPOSE YOU LEST I SHOULD DISPLEASE THE COMPANY
WELL THEN PROCEED WITH YOUR ANSWERS AND LET ME HAVE THE REMAINDER OF
MY REPAST
FOR WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THAT THE JUST ARE CLEARLY WISER AND
BETTER AND ABLER THAN THE UNJUST AND THAT THE UNJUST ARE INCAPABLE OF
COMMON ACTION NAY MORE THAT TO SPEAK AS WE DID OF MEN WHO ARE EVIL
ACTING AT ANY TIME VIGOROUSLY TOGETHER IS NOT STRICTLY TRUE FOR
IF THEY HAD BEEN PERFECTLY EVIL THEY WOULD HAVE LAID HANDS UPON ONE
ANOTHER BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME REMNANT OF
JUSTICE IN THEM WHICH ENABLED THEM TO COMBINE IF THERE HAD NOT BEEN
THEY WOULD HAVE INJURED ONE ANOTHER AS WELL AS THEIR VICTIMS THEY
WERE BUT HALF VILLAINS IN THEIR ENTERPRISES FOR HAD THEY BEEN WHOLE
VILLAINS AND UTTERLY UNJUST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF
ACTION
THAT AS I BELIEVE IS THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AND NOT WHAT YOU
SAID AT FIRST
BUT WHETHER THE JUST HAVE A BETTER AND HAPPIER LIFE THAN
THE UNJUST IS A FURTHER QUESTION WHICH WE ALSO PROPOSED TO CONSIDER
I
THINK THAT THEY HAVE AND FOR THE REASONS WHICH I HAVE GIVEN BUT STILL
I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE FURTHER FOR NO LIGHT MATTER IS AT STAKE
NOTHING LESS THAN THE RULE OF HUMAN LIFE
PROCEED
I WILL PROCEED BY ASKING A QUESTION WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT A HORSE HAS
SOME END
I SHOULD
AND THE END OR USE OF A HORSE OR OF ANYTHING WOULD BE THAT WHICH COULD
NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED OR NOT SO WELL ACCOMPLISHED BY ANY OTHER THING
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HE SAID
LET ME EXPLAIN CAN YOU SEE EXCEPT WITH THE EYE
CERTAINLY NOT
OR HEAR EXCEPT WITH THE EAR
NO
THESE THEN MAY BE TRULY SAID TO BE THE ENDS OF THESE ORGANS
THEY MAY
BUT YOU CAN CUT OFF A VINE BRANCH WITH A DAGGER OR WITH A CHISEL AND IN
MANY OTHER WAYS
OF COURSE
AND YET NOT SO WELL AS WITH A PRUNING HOOK MADE FOR THE PURPOSE
TRUE
MAY WE NOT SAY THAT THIS IS THE END OF A PRUNING HOOK
WE MAY
THEN NOW I THINK YOU WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING MY MEANING
WHEN I ASKED THE QUESTION WHETHER THE END OF ANYTHING WOULD BE THAT
WHICH COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED OR NOT SO WELL ACCOMPLISHED BY ANY
OTHER THING
I UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING HE SAID AND ASSENT
AND THAT TO WHICH AN END IS APPOINTED HAS ALSO AN EXCELLENCE NEED I ASK
AGAIN WHETHER THE EYE HAS AN END
IT HAS
AND HAS NOT THE EYE AN EXCELLENCE
YES
AND THE EAR HAS AN END AND AN EXCELLENCE ALSO
TRUE
AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF ALL OTHER THINGS THEY HAVE EACH OF THEM AN END
AND A SPECIAL EXCELLENCE
THAT IS SO
WELL AND CAN THE EYES FULFIL THEIR END IF THEY ARE WANTING IN THEIR OWN
PROPER EXCELLENCE AND HAVE A DEFECT INSTEAD
HOW CAN THEY HE SAID IF THEY ARE BLIND AND CANNOT SEE
YOU MEAN TO SAY IF THEY HAVE LOST THEIR PROPER EXCELLENCE WHICH IS
SIGHT BUT I HAVE NOT ARRIVED AT THAT POINT YET
I WOULD RATHER ASK
THE QUESTION MORE GENERALLY AND ONLY ENQUIRE WHETHER THE THINGS WHICH
FULFIL THEIR ENDS FULFIL THEM BY THEIR OWN PROPER EXCELLENCE AND FAIL
OF FULFILLING THEM BY THEIR OWN DEFECT
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
I MIGHT SAY THE SAME OF THE EARS WHEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR OWN PROPER
EXCELLENCE THEY CANNOT FULFIL THEIR END
TRUE
AND THE SAME OBSERVATION WILL APPLY TO ALL OTHER THINGS
I AGREE
WELL AND HAS NOT THE SOUL AN END WHICH NOTHING ELSE CAN FULFIL FOR
EXAMPLE TO SUPERINTEND AND COMMAND AND DELIBERATE AND THE LIKE
ARE NOT
THESE FUNCTIONS PROPER TO THE SOUL AND CAN THEY RIGHTLY BE ASSIGNED TO
ANY OTHER
TO NO OTHER
AND IS NOT LIFE TO BE RECKONED AMONG THE ENDS OF THE SOUL
ASSUREDLY HE SAID
AND HAS NOT THE SOUL AN EXCELLENCE ALSO
YES
AND CAN SHE OR CAN SHE NOT FULFIL HER OWN ENDS WHEN DEPRIVED OF THAT
EXCELLENCE
SHE CANNOT
THEN AN EVIL SOUL MUST NECESSARILY BE AN EVIL RULER AND SUPERINTENDENT
AND THE GOOD SOUL A GOOD RULER
YES NECESSARILY
AND WE HAVE ADMITTED THAT JUSTICE IS THE EXCELLENCE OF THE SOUL AND
INJUSTICE THE DEFECT OF THE SOUL
THAT HAS BEEN ADMITTED
THEN THE JUST SOUL AND THE JUST MAN WILL LIVE WELL AND THE UNJUST MAN
WILL LIVE ILL
THAT IS WHAT YOUR ARGUMENT PROVES
AND HE WHO LIVES WELL IS BLESSED AND HAPPY AND HE WHO LIVES ILL THE
REVERSE OF HAPPY
CERTAINLY
THEN THE JUST IS HAPPY AND THE UNJUST MISERABLE
SO BE IT
BUT HAPPINESS AND NOT MISERY IS PROFITABLE
OF COURSE
THEN MY BLESSED THRASYMACHUS INJUSTICE CAN NEVER BE MORE PROFITABLE
THAN JUSTICE
LET THIS SOCRATES HE SAID BE YOUR ENTERTAINMENT AT THE BENDIDEA
FOR WHICH I AM INDEBTED TO YOU I SAID NOW THAT YOU HAVE GROWN GENTLE
TOWARDS ME AND HAVE LEFT OFF SCOLDING
NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT BEEN
WELL ENTERTAINED BUT THAT WAS MY OWN FAULT AND NOT YOURS
AS AN EPICURE
SNATCHES A TASTE OF EVERY DISH WHICH IS SUCCESSIVELY BROUGHT TO TABLE
HE NOT HAVING ALLOWED HIMSELF TIME TO ENJOY THE ONE BEFORE SO HAVE I
GONE FROM ONE SUBJECT TO ANOTHER WITHOUT HAVING DISCOVERED WHAT I SOUGHT
AT FIRST THE NATURE OF JUSTICE
I LEFT THAT ENQUIRY AND TURNED AWAY
TO CONSIDER WHETHER JUSTICE IS VIRTUE AND WISDOM OR EVIL AND FOLLY AND
WHEN THERE AROSE A FURTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES OF
JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM PASSING ON TO THAT
AND
THE RESULT OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN THAT I KNOW NOTHING AT ALL
FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT JUSTICE IS AND THEREFORE I AM NOT LIKELY TO KNOW
WHETHER IT IS OR IS NOT A VIRTUE NOR CAN I SAY WHETHER THE JUST MAN IS
HAPPY OR UNHAPPY
BOOK II
WITH THESE WORDS I WAS THINKING THAT I HAD MADE AN END OF THE
DISCUSSION BUT THE END IN TRUTH PROVED TO BE ONLY A BEGINNING
FOR
GLAUCON WHO IS ALWAYS THE MOST PUGNACIOUS OF MEN WAS DISSATISFIED AT
THRASYMACHUS' RETIREMENT HE WANTED TO HAVE THE BATTLE OUT
SO HE SAID
TO ME SOCRATES DO YOU WISH REALLY TO PERSUADE US OR ONLY TO SEEM TO
HAVE PERSUADED US THAT TO BE JUST IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN TO BE UNJUST
I SHOULD WISH REALLY TO PERSUADE YOU I REPLIED IF I COULD
THEN YOU CERTAINLY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED
LET ME ASK YOU NOW HOW WOULD
YOU ARRANGE GOODS ARE THERE NOT SOME WHICH WE WELCOME FOR THEIR
OWN SAKES AND INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR CONSEQUENCES AS FOR EXAMPLE
HARMLESS PLEASURES AND ENJOYMENTS WHICH DELIGHT US AT THE TIME
ALTHOUGH NOTHING FOLLOWS FROM THEM
I AGREE IN THINKING THAT THERE IS SUCH A CLASS I REPLIED
IS THERE NOT ALSO A SECOND CLASS OF GOODS SUCH AS KNOWLEDGE SIGHT
HEALTH WHICH ARE DESIRABLE NOT ONLY IN THEMSELVES BUT ALSO FOR THEIR
RESULTS
CERTAINLY I SAID
AND WOULD YOU NOT RECOGNIZE A THIRD CLASS SUCH AS GYMNASTIC AND THE
CARE OF THE SICK AND THE PHYSICIAN'S ART ALSO THE VARIOUS WAYS OF
MONEY MAKING THESE DO US GOOD BUT WE REGARD THEM AS DISAGREEABLE AND
NO ONE WOULD CHOOSE THEM FOR THEIR OWN SAKES BUT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF
SOME REWARD OR RESULT WHICH FLOWS FROM THEM
THERE IS I SAID THIS THIRD CLASS ALSO
BUT WHY DO YOU ASK
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW IN WHICH OF THE THREE CLASSES YOU WOULD PLACE
JUSTICE
IN THE HIGHEST CLASS I REPLIED AMONG THOSE GOODS WHICH HE WHO WOULD
BE HAPPY DESIRES BOTH FOR THEIR OWN SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR
RESULTS
THEN THE MANY ARE OF ANOTHER MIND THEY THINK THAT JUSTICE IS TO BE
RECKONED IN THE TROUBLESOME CLASS AMONG GOODS WHICH ARE TO BE PURSUED
FOR THE SAKE OF REWARDS AND OF REPUTATION BUT IN THEMSELVES ARE
DISAGREEABLE AND RATHER TO BE AVOIDED
I KNOW I SAID THAT THIS IS THEIR MANNER OF THINKING AND THAT THIS WAS
THE THESIS WHICH THRASYMACHUS WAS MAINTAINING JUST NOW WHEN HE CENSURED
JUSTICE AND PRAISED INJUSTICE
BUT I AM TOO STUPID TO BE CONVINCED BY
HIM
I WISH HE SAID THAT YOU WOULD HEAR ME AS WELL AS HIM AND THEN I SHALL
SEE WHETHER YOU AND I AGREE
FOR THRASYMACHUS SEEMS TO ME LIKE A SNAKE
TO HAVE BEEN CHARMED BY YOUR VOICE SOONER THAN HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
BUT TO MY MIND THE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE HAVE NOT YET BEEN
MADE CLEAR
SETTING ASIDE THEIR REWARDS AND RESULTS I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THEY ARE IN THEMSELVES AND HOW THEY INWARDLY WORK IN THE SOUL
IF YOU
PLEASE THEN I WILL REVIVE THE ARGUMENT OF THRASYMACHUS
AND FIRST I
WILL SPEAK OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF JUSTICE ACCORDING TO THE COMMON
VIEW OF THEM
SECONDLY I WILL SHOW THAT ALL MEN WHO PRACTISE JUSTICE DO
SO AGAINST THEIR WILL OF NECESSITY BUT NOT AS A GOOD
AND THIRDLY I
WILL ARGUE THAT THERE IS REASON IN THIS VIEW FOR THE LIFE OF THE UNJUST
IS AFTER ALL BETTER FAR THAN THE LIFE OF THE JUST IF WHAT THEY SAY
IS TRUE SOCRATES SINCE I MYSELF AM NOT OF THEIR OPINION
BUT STILL I
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM PERPLEXED WHEN I HEAR THE VOICES OF THRASYMACHUS
AND MYRIADS OF OTHERS DINNING IN MY EARS AND ON THE OTHER HAND I HAVE
NEVER YET HEARD THE SUPERIORITY OF JUSTICE TO INJUSTICE MAINTAINED BY
ANY ONE IN A SATISFACTORY WAY
I WANT TO HEAR JUSTICE PRAISED IN RESPECT
OF ITSELF THEN I SHALL BE SATISFIED AND YOU ARE THE PERSON FROM WHOM
I THINK THAT I AM MOST LIKELY TO HEAR THIS AND THEREFORE I WILL PRAISE
THE UNJUST LIFE TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER AND MY MANNER OF SPEAKING
WILL INDICATE THE MANNER IN WHICH I DESIRE TO HEAR YOU TOO PRAISING
JUSTICE AND CENSURING INJUSTICE
WILL YOU SAY WHETHER YOU APPROVE OF MY
PROPOSAL
INDEED I DO NOR CAN I IMAGINE ANY THEME ABOUT WHICH A MAN OF SENSE
WOULD OFTENER WISH TO CONVERSE
I AM DELIGHTED HE REPLIED TO HEAR YOU SAY SO AND SHALL BEGIN BY
SPEAKING AS I PROPOSED OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF JUSTICE
THEY SAY THAT TO DO INJUSTICE IS BY NATURE GOOD TO SUFFER INJUSTICE
EVIL BUT THAT THE EVIL IS GREATER THAN THE GOOD
AND SO WHEN MEN HAVE
BOTH DONE AND SUFFERED INJUSTICE AND HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE OF BOTH NOT
BEING ABLE TO AVOID THE ONE AND OBTAIN THE OTHER THEY THINK THAT THEY
HAD BETTER AGREE AMONG THEMSELVES TO HAVE NEITHER HENCE THERE ARISE
LAWS AND MUTUAL COVENANTS AND THAT WHICH IS ORDAINED BY LAW IS TERMED
BY THEM LAWFUL AND JUST
THIS THEY AFFIRM TO BE THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF
JUSTICE IT IS A MEAN OR COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE BEST OF ALL WHICH IS
TO DO INJUSTICE AND NOT BE PUNISHED AND THE WORST OF ALL WHICH IS TO
SUFFER INJUSTICE WITHOUT THE POWER OF RETALIATION AND JUSTICE BEING AT
A MIDDLE POINT BETWEEN THE TWO IS TOLERATED NOT AS A GOOD BUT AS
THE LESSER EVIL AND HONOURED BY REASON OF THE INABILITY OF MEN TO DO
INJUSTICE
FOR NO MAN WHO IS WORTHY TO BE CALLED A MAN WOULD EVER SUBMIT
TO SUCH AN AGREEMENT IF HE WERE ABLE TO RESIST HE WOULD BE MAD IF HE
DID
SUCH IS THE RECEIVED ACCOUNT SOCRATES OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF
JUSTICE
NOW THAT THOSE WHO PRACTISE JUSTICE DO SO INVOLUNTARILY AND BECAUSE THEY
HAVE NOT THE POWER TO BE UNJUST WILL BEST APPEAR IF WE IMAGINE SOMETHING
OF THIS KIND HAVING GIVEN BOTH TO THE JUST AND THE UNJUST POWER TO DO
WHAT THEY WILL LET US WATCH AND SEE WHITHER DESIRE WILL LEAD THEM
THEN WE SHALL DISCOVER IN THE VERY ACT THE JUST AND UNJUST MAN TO BE
PROCEEDING ALONG THE SAME ROAD FOLLOWING THEIR INTEREST WHICH ALL
NATURES DEEM TO BE THEIR GOOD AND ARE ONLY DIVERTED INTO THE PATH OF
JUSTICE BY THE FORCE OF LAW
THE LIBERTY WHICH WE ARE SUPPOSING MAY BE
MOST COMPLETELY GIVEN TO THEM IN THE FORM OF SUCH A POWER AS IS SAID
TO HAVE BEEN POSSESSED BY GYGES THE ANCESTOR OF CROESUS THE LYDIAN
ACCORDING TO THE TRADITION GYGES WAS A SHEPHERD IN THE SERVICE OF
THE KING OF LYDIA THERE WAS A GREAT STORM AND AN EARTHQUAKE MADE AN
OPENING IN THE EARTH AT THE PLACE WHERE HE WAS FEEDING HIS FLOCK
AMAZED
AT THE SIGHT HE DESCENDED INTO THE OPENING WHERE AMONG OTHER MARVELS
HE BEHELD A HOLLOW BRAZEN HORSE HAVING DOORS AT WHICH HE STOOPING AND
LOOKING IN SAW A DEAD BODY OF STATURE AS APPEARED TO HIM MORE THAN
HUMAN AND HAVING NOTHING ON BUT A GOLD RING THIS HE TOOK FROM THE
FINGER OF THE DEAD AND REASCENDED
NOW THE SHEPHERDS MET TOGETHER
ACCORDING TO CUSTOM THAT THEY MIGHT SEND THEIR MONTHLY REPORT ABOUT THE
FLOCKS TO THE KING INTO THEIR ASSEMBLY HE CAME HAVING THE RING ON HIS
FINGER AND AS HE WAS SITTING AMONG THEM HE CHANCED TO TURN THE COLLET
OF THE RING INSIDE HIS HAND WHEN INSTANTLY HE BECAME INVISIBLE TO THE
REST OF THE COMPANY AND THEY BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HIM AS IF HE WERE NO
LONGER PRESENT
HE WAS ASTONISHED AT THIS AND AGAIN TOUCHING THE RING
HE TURNED THE COLLET OUTWARDS AND REAPPEARED HE MADE SEVERAL TRIALS
OF THE RING AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT WHEN HE TURNED THE COLLET
INWARDS HE BECAME INVISIBLE WHEN OUTWARDS HE REAPPEARED
WHEREUPON HE
CONTRIVED TO BE CHOSEN ONE OF THE MESSENGERS WHO WERE SENT TO THE COURT
WHEREAS SOON AS HE ARRIVED HE SEDUCED THE QUEEN AND WITH HER HELP
CONSPIRED AGAINST THE KING AND SLEW HIM AND TOOK THE KINGDOM
SUPPOSE
NOW THAT THERE WERE TWO SUCH MAGIC RINGS AND THE JUST PUT ON ONE OF
THEM AND THE UNJUST THE OTHER NO MAN CAN BE IMAGINED TO BE OF SUCH AN
IRON NATURE THAT HE WOULD STAND FAST IN JUSTICE
NO MAN WOULD KEEP HIS
HANDS OFF WHAT WAS NOT HIS OWN WHEN HE COULD SAFELY TAKE WHAT HE
LIKED OUT OF THE MARKET OR GO INTO HOUSES AND LIE WITH ANY ONE AT
HIS PLEASURE OR KILL OR RELEASE FROM PRISON WHOM HE WOULD AND IN ALL
RESPECTS BE LIKE A GOD AMONG MEN
THEN THE ACTIONS OF THE JUST WOULD BE
AS THE ACTIONS OF THE UNJUST THEY WOULD BOTH COME AT LAST TO THE SAME
POINT
AND THIS WE MAY TRULY AFFIRM TO BE A GREAT PROOF THAT A MAN IS
JUST NOT WILLINGLY OR BECAUSE HE THINKS THAT JUSTICE IS ANY GOOD TO HIM
INDIVIDUALLY BUT OF NECESSITY FOR WHEREVER ANY ONE THINKS THAT HE
CAN SAFELY BE UNJUST THERE HE IS UNJUST
FOR ALL MEN BELIEVE IN THEIR
HEARTS THAT INJUSTICE IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAN
JUSTICE AND HE WHO ARGUES AS I HAVE BEEN SUPPOSING WILL SAY THAT THEY
ARE RIGHT
IF YOU COULD IMAGINE ANY ONE OBTAINING THIS POWER OF BECOMING
INVISIBLE AND NEVER DOING ANY WRONG OR TOUCHING WHAT WAS ANOTHER'S HE
WOULD BE THOUGHT BY THE LOOKERS ON TO BE A MOST WRETCHED IDIOT ALTHOUGH
THEY WOULD PRAISE HIM TO ONE ANOTHER'S FACES AND KEEP UP APPEARANCES
WITH ONE ANOTHER FROM A FEAR THAT THEY TOO MIGHT SUFFER INJUSTICE
ENOUGH OF THIS
NOW IF WE ARE TO FORM A REAL JUDGMENT OF THE LIFE OF THE JUST AND
UNJUST WE MUST ISOLATE THEM THERE IS NO OTHER WAY AND HOW IS THE
ISOLATION TO BE EFFECTED I ANSWER LET THE UNJUST MAN BE ENTIRELY
UNJUST AND THE JUST MAN ENTIRELY JUST NOTHING IS TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM
EITHER OF THEM AND BOTH ARE TO BE PERFECTLY FURNISHED FOR THE WORK
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LIVES
FIRST LET THE UNJUST BE LIKE OTHER
DISTINGUISHED MASTERS OF CRAFT LIKE THE SKILFUL PILOT OR PHYSICIAN WHO
KNOWS INTUITIVELY HIS OWN POWERS AND KEEPS WITHIN THEIR LIMITS AND WHO
IF HE FAILS AT ANY POINT IS ABLE TO RECOVER HIMSELF
SO LET THE UNJUST
MAKE HIS UNJUST ATTEMPTS IN THE RIGHT WAY AND LIE HIDDEN IF HE MEANS
TO BE GREAT IN HIS INJUSTICE HE WHO IS FOUND OUT IS NOBODY FOR
THE HIGHEST REACH OF INJUSTICE IS TO BE DEEMED JUST WHEN YOU ARE NOT
THEREFORE I SAY THAT IN THE PERFECTLY UNJUST MAN WE MUST ASSUME THE MOST
PERFECT INJUSTICE THERE IS TO BE NO DEDUCTION BUT WE MUST ALLOW
HIM WHILE DOING THE MOST UNJUST ACTS TO HAVE ACQUIRED THE GREATEST
REPUTATION FOR JUSTICE
IF HE HAVE TAKEN A FALSE STEP HE MUST BE ABLE TO
RECOVER HIMSELF HE MUST BE ONE WHO CAN SPEAK WITH EFFECT IF ANY OF HIS
DEEDS COME TO LIGHT AND WHO CAN FORCE HIS WAY WHERE FORCE IS REQUIRED
BY HIS COURAGE AND STRENGTH AND COMMAND OF MONEY AND FRIENDS
AND AT
HIS SIDE LET US PLACE THE JUST MAN IN HIS NOBLENESS AND SIMPLICITY
WISHING AS AESCHYLUS SAYS TO BE AND NOT TO SEEM GOOD
THERE MUST BE NO
SEEMING FOR IF HE SEEM TO BE JUST HE WILL BE HONOURED AND REWARDED AND
THEN WE SHALL NOT KNOW WHETHER HE IS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF JUSTICE OR
FOR THE SAKE OF HONOURS AND REWARDS THEREFORE LET HIM BE CLOTHED IN
JUSTICE ONLY AND HAVE NO OTHER COVERING AND HE MUST BE IMAGINED IN A
STATE OF LIFE THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER
LET HIM BE THE BEST OF MEN
AND LET HIM BE THOUGHT THE WORST THEN HE WILL HAVE BEEN PUT TO THE
PROOF AND WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HE WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE FEAR OF
INFAMY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
AND LET HIM CONTINUE THUS TO THE HOUR OF
DEATH BEING JUST AND SEEMING TO BE UNJUST
WHEN BOTH HAVE REACHED THE
UTTERMOST EXTREME THE ONE OF JUSTICE AND THE OTHER OF INJUSTICE LET
JUDGMENT BE GIVEN WHICH OF THEM IS THE HAPPIER OF THE TWO
HEAVENS MY DEAR GLAUCON I SAID HOW ENERGETICALLY YOU POLISH THEM
UP FOR THE DECISION FIRST ONE AND THEN THE OTHER AS IF THEY WERE TWO
STATUES
I DO MY BEST HE SAID
AND NOW THAT WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE LIKE THERE
IS NO DIFFICULTY IN TRACING OUT THE SORT OF LIFE WHICH AWAITS EITHER
OF THEM
THIS I WILL PROCEED TO DESCRIBE BUT AS YOU MAY THINK THE
DESCRIPTION A LITTLE TOO COARSE I ASK YOU TO SUPPOSE SOCRATES THAT
THE WORDS WHICH FOLLOW ARE NOT MINE LET ME PUT THEM INTO THE MOUTHS OF
THE EULOGISTS OF INJUSTICE THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THE JUST MAN WHO IS
THOUGHT UNJUST WILL BE SCOURGED RACKED BOUND WILL HAVE HIS EYES
BURNT OUT AND AT LAST AFTER SUFFERING EVERY KIND OF EVIL HE WILL BE
IMPALED THEN HE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT HE OUGHT TO SEEM ONLY AND NOT TO
BE JUST THE WORDS OF AESCHYLUS MAY BE MORE TRULY SPOKEN OF THE UNJUST
THAN OF THE JUST
FOR THE UNJUST IS PURSUING A REALITY HE DOES NOT LIVE
WITH A VIEW TO APPEARANCES HE WANTS TO BE REALLY UNJUST AND NOT TO SEEM
ONLY
'HIS MIND HAS A SOIL DEEP AND FERTILE OUT OF WHICH SPRING HIS PRUDENT
COUNSELS
IN THE FIRST PLACE HE IS THOUGHT JUST AND THEREFORE BEARS RULE IN THE
CITY HE CAN MARRY WHOM HE WILL AND GIVE IN MARRIAGE TO WHOM HE
WILL ALSO HE CAN TRADE AND DEAL WHERE HE LIKES AND ALWAYS TO HIS OWN
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE HE HAS NO MISGIVINGS ABOUT INJUSTICE AND AT EVERY
CONTEST WHETHER IN PUBLIC OR PRIVATE HE GETS THE BETTER OF HIS
ANTAGONISTS AND GAINS AT THEIR EXPENSE AND IS RICH AND OUT OF HIS
GAINS HE CAN BENEFIT HIS FRIENDS AND HARM HIS ENEMIES MOREOVER HE
CAN OFFER SACRIFICES AND DEDICATE GIFTS TO THE GODS ABUNDANTLY AND
MAGNIFICENTLY AND CAN HONOUR THE GODS OR ANY MAN WHOM HE WANTS TO
HONOUR IN A FAR BETTER STYLE THAN THE JUST AND THEREFORE HE IS LIKELY
TO BE DEARER THAN THEY ARE TO THE GODS
AND THUS SOCRATES GODS AND MEN
ARE SAID TO UNITE IN MAKING THE LIFE OF THE UNJUST BETTER THAN THE LIFE
OF THE JUST
I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING IN ANSWER TO GLAUCON WHEN ADEIMANTUS HIS
BROTHER INTERPOSED SOCRATES HE SAID YOU DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS
NOTHING MORE TO BE URGED
WHY WHAT ELSE IS THERE I ANSWERED
THE STRONGEST POINT OF ALL HAS NOT BEEN EVEN MENTIONED HE REPLIED
WELL THEN ACCORDING TO THE PROVERB 'LET BROTHER HELP BROTHER' IF
HE FAILS IN ANY PART DO YOU ASSIST HIM ALTHOUGH I MUST CONFESS THAT
GLAUCON HAS ALREADY SAID QUITE ENOUGH TO LAY ME IN THE DUST AND TAKE
FROM ME THE POWER OF HELPING JUSTICE
NONSENSE HE REPLIED
BUT LET ME ADD SOMETHING MORE THERE IS ANOTHER
SIDE TO GLAUCON'S ARGUMENT ABOUT THE PRAISE AND CENSURE OF JUSTICE
AND INJUSTICE WHICH IS EQUALLY REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BRING OUT WHAT I
BELIEVE TO BE HIS MEANING
PARENTS AND TUTORS ARE ALWAYS TELLING THEIR
SONS AND THEIR WARDS THAT THEY ARE TO BE JUST BUT WHY NOT FOR THE SAKE
OF JUSTICE BUT FOR THE SAKE OF CHARACTER AND REPUTATION IN THE HOPE OF
OBTAINING FOR HIM WHO IS REPUTED JUST SOME OF THOSE OFFICES MARRIAGES
AND THE LIKE WHICH GLAUCON HAS ENUMERATED AMONG THE ADVANTAGES ACCRUING
TO THE UNJUST FROM THE REPUTATION OF JUSTICE
MORE HOWEVER IS MADE OF
APPEARANCES BY THIS CLASS OF PERSONS THAN BY THE OTHERS FOR THEY
THROW IN THE GOOD OPINION OF THE GODS AND WILL TELL YOU OF A SHOWER OF
BENEFITS WHICH THE HEAVENS AS THEY SAY RAIN UPON THE PIOUS AND THIS
ACCORDS WITH THE TESTIMONY OF THE NOBLE HESIOD AND HOMER THE FIRST OF
WHOM SAYS THAT THE GODS MAKE THE OAKS OF THE JUST
'TO BEAR ACORNS AT THEIR SUMMIT AND BEES IN THE MIDDLE
AND THE SHEEP ARE BOWED DOWN WITH THE WEIGHT OF THEIR FLEECES
AND MANY OTHER BLESSINGS OF A LIKE KIND ARE PROVIDED FOR THEM
AND HOMER
HAS A VERY SIMILAR STRAIN FOR HE SPEAKS OF ONE WHOSE FAME IS
'AS THE FAME OF SOME BLAMELESS KING WHO LIKE A GOD MAINTAINS JUSTICE
TO WHOM THE BLACK EARTH BRINGS FORTH WHEAT AND BARLEY WHOSE TREES ARE
BOWED WITH FRUIT AND HIS SHEEP NEVER FAIL TO BEAR AND THE SEA GIVES
HIM FISH
STILL GRANDER ARE THE GIFTS OF HEAVEN WHICH MUSAEUS AND HIS SON
VOUCHSAFE TO THE JUST THEY TAKE THEM DOWN INTO THE WORLD BELOW WHERE
THEY HAVE THE SAINTS LYING ON COUCHES AT A FEAST EVERLASTINGLY DRUNK
CROWNED WITH GARLANDS THEIR IDEA SEEMS TO BE THAT AN IMMORTALITY OF
DRUNKENNESS IS THE HIGHEST MEED OF VIRTUE
SOME EXTEND THEIR REWARDS
YET FURTHER THE POSTERITY AS THEY SAY OF THE FAITHFUL AND JUST SHALL
SURVIVE TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATION
THIS IS THE STYLE IN WHICH
THEY PRAISE JUSTICE
BUT ABOUT THE WICKED THERE IS ANOTHER STRAIN THEY
BURY THEM IN A SLOUGH IN HADES AND MAKE THEM CARRY WATER IN A SIEVE
ALSO WHILE THEY ARE YET LIVING THEY BRING THEM TO INFAMY AND INFLICT
UPON THEM THE PUNISHMENTS WHICH GLAUCON DESCRIBED AS THE PORTION OF THE
JUST WHO ARE REPUTED TO BE UNJUST NOTHING ELSE DOES THEIR INVENTION
SUPPLY
SUCH IS THEIR MANNER OF PRAISING THE ONE AND CENSURING THE
OTHER
ONCE MORE SOCRATES I WILL ASK YOU TO CONSIDER ANOTHER WAY OF SPEAKING
ABOUT JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE WHICH IS NOT CONFINED TO THE POETS BUT
IS FOUND IN PROSE WRITERS
THE UNIVERSAL VOICE OF MANKIND IS ALWAYS
DECLARING THAT JUSTICE AND VIRTUE ARE HONOURABLE BUT GRIEVOUS AND
TOILSOME AND THAT THE PLEASURES OF VICE AND INJUSTICE ARE EASY OF
ATTAINMENT AND ARE ONLY CENSURED BY LAW AND OPINION
THEY SAY ALSO THAT
HONESTY IS FOR THE MOST PART LESS PROFITABLE THAN DISHONESTY AND THEY
ARE QUITE READY TO CALL WICKED MEN HAPPY AND TO HONOUR THEM BOTH IN
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WHEN THEY ARE RICH OR IN ANY OTHER WAY INFLUENTIAL
WHILE THEY DESPISE AND OVERLOOK THOSE WHO MAY BE WEAK AND POOR EVEN
THOUGH ACKNOWLEDGING THEM TO BE BETTER THAN THE OTHERS
BUT MOST
EXTRAORDINARY OF ALL IS THEIR MODE OF SPEAKING ABOUT VIRTUE AND THE
GODS THEY SAY THAT THE GODS APPORTION CALAMITY AND MISERY TO MANY GOOD
MEN AND GOOD AND HAPPINESS TO THE WICKED
AND MENDICANT PROPHETS GO TO
RICH MEN'S DOORS AND PERSUADE THEM THAT THEY HAVE A POWER COMMITTED
TO THEM BY THE GODS OF MAKING AN ATONEMENT FOR A MAN'S OWN OR HIS
ANCESTOR'S SINS BY SACRIFICES OR CHARMS WITH REJOICINGS AND FEASTS AND
THEY PROMISE TO HARM AN ENEMY WHETHER JUST OR UNJUST AT A SMALL COST
WITH MAGIC ARTS AND INCANTATIONS BINDING HEAVEN AS THEY SAY TO EXECUTE
THEIR WILL
AND THE POETS ARE THE AUTHORITIES TO WHOM THEY APPEAL NOW
SMOOTHING THE PATH OF VICE WITH THE WORDS OF HESIOD
'VICE MAY BE HAD IN ABUNDANCE WITHOUT TROUBLE THE WAY IS SMOOTH AND HER
DWELLING PLACE IS NEAR
BUT BEFORE VIRTUE THE GODS HAVE SET TOIL
AND A TEDIOUS AND UPHILL ROAD THEN CITING HOMER AS A WITNESS THAT THE
GODS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MEN FOR HE ALSO SAYS
'THE GODS TOO MAY BE TURNED FROM THEIR PURPOSE AND MEN PRAY TO THEM
AND AVERT THEIR WRATH BY SACRIFICES AND SOOTHING ENTREATIES AND BY
LIBATIONS AND THE ODOUR OF FAT WHEN THEY HAVE SINNED AND TRANSGRESSED
AND THEY PRODUCE A HOST OF BOOKS WRITTEN BY MUSAEUS AND ORPHEUS
WHO WERE CHILDREN OF THE MOON AND THE MUSES THAT IS WHAT THEY
SAY ACCORDING TO WHICH THEY PERFORM THEIR RITUAL AND PERSUADE NOT ONLY
INDIVIDUALS BUT WHOLE CITIES THAT EXPIATIONS AND ATONEMENTS FOR SIN
MAY BE MADE BY SACRIFICES AND AMUSEMENTS WHICH FILL A VACANT HOUR AND
ARE EQUALLY AT THE SERVICE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD THE LATTER SORT
THEY CALL MYSTERIES AND THEY REDEEM US FROM THE PAINS OF HELL BUT IF
WE NEGLECT THEM NO ONE KNOWS WHAT AWAITS US
HE PROCEEDED AND NOW WHEN THE YOUNG HEAR ALL THIS SAID ABOUT VIRTUE AND
VICE AND THE WAY IN WHICH GODS AND MEN REGARD THEM HOW ARE THEIR MINDS
LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED MY DEAR SOCRATES THOSE OF THEM I MEAN WHO ARE
QUICKWITTED AND LIKE BEES ON THE WING LIGHT ON EVERY FLOWER AND FROM
ALL THAT THEY HEAR ARE PRONE TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHAT MANNER OF
PERSONS THEY SHOULD BE AND IN WHAT WAY THEY SHOULD WALK IF THEY WOULD
MAKE THE BEST OF LIFE PROBABLY THE YOUTH WILL SAY TO HIMSELF IN THE
WORDS OF PINDAR
'CAN I BY JUSTICE OR BY CROOKED WAYS OF DECEIT ASCEND A LOFTIER TOWER
WHICH MAY BE A FORTRESS TO ME ALL MY DAYS
FOR WHAT MEN SAY IS THAT IF I AM REALLY JUST AND AM NOT ALSO THOUGHT
JUST PROFIT THERE IS NONE BUT THE PAIN AND LOSS ON THE OTHER HAND
ARE UNMISTAKEABLE
BUT IF THOUGH UNJUST I ACQUIRE THE REPUTATION OF
JUSTICE A HEAVENLY LIFE IS PROMISED TO ME
SINCE THEN AS PHILOSOPHERS
PROVE APPEARANCE TYRANNIZES OVER TRUTH AND IS LORD OF HAPPINESS TO
APPEARANCE I MUST DEVOTE MYSELF
I WILL DESCRIBE AROUND ME A PICTURE AND
SHADOW OF VIRTUE TO BE THE VESTIBULE AND EXTERIOR OF MY HOUSE BEHIND I
WILL TRAIL THE SUBTLE AND CRAFTY FOX AS ARCHILOCHUS GREATEST OF SAGES
RECOMMENDS
BUT I HEAR SOME ONE EXCLAIMING THAT THE CONCEALMENT OF
WICKEDNESS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO WHICH I ANSWER NOTHING GREAT IS EASY
NEVERTHELESS THE ARGUMENT INDICATES THIS IF WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE
THE PATH ALONG WHICH WE SHOULD PROCEED
WITH A VIEW TO CONCEALMENT WE
WILL ESTABLISH SECRET BROTHERHOODS AND POLITICAL CLUBS
AND THERE
ARE PROFESSORS OF RHETORIC WHO TEACH THE ART OF PERSUADING COURTS AND
ASSEMBLIES AND SO PARTLY BY PERSUASION AND PARTLY BY FORCE I SHALL
MAKE UNLAWFUL GAINS AND NOT BE PUNISHED
STILL I HEAR A VOICE SAYING
THAT THE GODS CANNOT BE DECEIVED NEITHER CAN THEY BE COMPELLED
BUT
WHAT IF THERE ARE NO GODS OR SUPPOSE THEM TO HAVE NO CARE OF HUMAN
THINGS WHY IN EITHER CASE SHOULD WE MIND ABOUT CONCEALMENT AND EVEN IF
THERE ARE GODS AND THEY DO CARE ABOUT US YET WE KNOW OF THEM ONLY
FROM TRADITION AND THE GENEALOGIES OF THE POETS AND THESE ARE THE VERY
PERSONS WHO SAY THAT THEY MAY BE INFLUENCED AND TURNED BY 'SACRIFICES
AND SOOTHING ENTREATIES AND BY OFFERINGS LET US BE CONSISTENT THEN
AND BELIEVE BOTH OR NEITHER
IF THE POETS SPEAK TRULY WHY THEN WE HAD
BETTER BE UNJUST AND OFFER OF THE FRUITS OF INJUSTICE FOR IF WE ARE
JUST ALTHOUGH WE MAY ESCAPE THE VENGEANCE OF HEAVEN WE SHALL LOSE THE
GAINS OF INJUSTICE BUT IF WE ARE UNJUST WE SHALL KEEP THE GAINS AND
BY OUR SINNING AND PRAYING AND PRAYING AND SINNING THE GODS WILL BE
PROPITIATED AND WE SHALL NOT BE PUNISHED
'BUT THERE IS A WORLD BELOW
IN WHICH EITHER WE OR OUR POSTERITY WILL SUFFER FOR OUR UNJUST DEEDS
YES MY FRIEND WILL BE THE REFLECTION BUT THERE ARE MYSTERIES AND
ATONING DEITIES AND THESE HAVE GREAT POWER
THAT IS WHAT MIGHTY
CITIES DECLARE AND THE CHILDREN OF THE GODS WHO WERE THEIR POETS AND
PROPHETS BEAR A LIKE TESTIMONY
ON WHAT PRINCIPLE THEN SHALL WE ANY LONGER CHOOSE JUSTICE RATHER THAN
THE WORST INJUSTICE WHEN IF WE ONLY UNITE THE LATTER WITH A DECEITFUL
REGARD TO APPEARANCES WE SHALL FARE TO OUR MIND BOTH WITH GODS AND
MEN IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH AS THE MOST NUMEROUS AND THE HIGHEST
AUTHORITIES TELL US
KNOWING ALL THIS SOCRATES HOW CAN A MAN WHO
HAS ANY SUPERIORITY OF MIND OR PERSON OR RANK OR WEALTH BE WILLING TO
HONOUR JUSTICE OR INDEED TO REFRAIN FROM LAUGHING WHEN HE HEARS JUSTICE
PRAISED AND EVEN IF THERE SHOULD BE SOME ONE WHO IS ABLE TO DISPROVE
THE TRUTH OF MY WORDS AND WHO IS SATISFIED THAT JUSTICE IS BEST STILL
HE IS NOT ANGRY WITH THE UNJUST BUT IS VERY READY TO FORGIVE THEM
BECAUSE HE ALSO KNOWS THAT MEN ARE NOT JUST OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL
UNLESS PERADVENTURE THERE BE SOME ONE WHOM THE DIVINITY WITHIN HIM MAY
HAVE INSPIRED WITH A HATRED OF INJUSTICE OR WHO HAS ATTAINED KNOWLEDGE
OF THE TRUTH BUT NO OTHER MAN
HE ONLY BLAMES INJUSTICE WHO OWING TO
COWARDICE OR AGE OR SOME WEAKNESS HAS NOT THE POWER OF BEING UNJUST
AND THIS IS PROVED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN HE OBTAINS THE POWER HE
IMMEDIATELY BECOMES UNJUST AS FAR AS HE CAN BE
THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS SOCRATES WAS INDICATED BY US AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE ARGUMENT WHEN MY BROTHER AND I TOLD YOU HOW ASTONISHED WE WERE TO
FIND THAT OF ALL THE PROFESSING PANEGYRISTS OF JUSTICE BEGINNING WITH
THE ANCIENT HEROES OF WHOM ANY MEMORIAL HAS BEEN PRESERVED TO US AND
ENDING WITH THE MEN OF OUR OWN TIME NO ONE HAS EVER BLAMED INJUSTICE OR
PRAISED JUSTICE EXCEPT WITH A VIEW TO THE GLORIES HONOURS AND BENEFITS
WHICH FLOW FROM THEM
NO ONE HAS EVER ADEQUATELY DESCRIBED EITHER IN
VERSE OR PROSE THE TRUE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF EITHER OF THEM ABIDING IN
THE SOUL AND INVISIBLE TO ANY HUMAN OR DIVINE EYE OR SHOWN THAT OF
ALL THE THINGS OF A MAN'S SOUL WHICH HE HAS WITHIN HIM JUSTICE IS
THE GREATEST GOOD AND INJUSTICE THE GREATEST EVIL
HAD THIS BEEN THE
UNIVERSAL STRAIN HAD YOU SOUGHT TO PERSUADE US OF THIS FROM OUR YOUTH
UPWARDS WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE WATCH TO KEEP ONE ANOTHER FROM
DOING WRONG BUT EVERY ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS OWN WATCHMAN BECAUSE
AFRAID IF HE DID WRONG OF HARBOURING IN HIMSELF THE GREATEST OF
EVILS
I DARE SAY THAT THRASYMACHUS AND OTHERS WOULD SERIOUSLY HOLD THE
LANGUAGE WHICH I HAVE BEEN MERELY REPEATING AND WORDS EVEN STRONGER
THAN THESE ABOUT JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE GROSSLY AS I CONCEIVE
PERVERTING THEIR TRUE NATURE
BUT I SPEAK IN THIS VEHEMENT MANNER AS
I MUST FRANKLY CONFESS TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU THE
OPPOSITE SIDE AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO SHOW NOT ONLY THE SUPERIORITY
WHICH JUSTICE HAS OVER INJUSTICE BUT WHAT EFFECT THEY HAVE ON THE
POSSESSOR OF THEM WHICH MAKES THE ONE TO BE A GOOD AND THE OTHER AN EVIL
TO HIM
AND PLEASE AS GLAUCON REQUESTED OF YOU TO EXCLUDE REPUTATIONS
FOR UNLESS YOU TAKE AWAY FROM EACH OF THEM HIS TRUE REPUTATION AND
ADD ON THE FALSE WE SHALL SAY THAT YOU DO NOT PRAISE JUSTICE BUT THE
APPEARANCE OF IT WE SHALL THINK THAT YOU ARE ONLY EXHORTING US TO KEEP
INJUSTICE DARK AND THAT YOU REALLY AGREE WITH THRASYMACHUS IN THINKING
THAT JUSTICE IS ANOTHER'S GOOD AND THE INTEREST OF THE STRONGER AND
THAT INJUSTICE IS A MAN'S OWN PROFIT AND INTEREST THOUGH INJURIOUS TO
THE WEAKER
NOW AS YOU HAVE ADMITTED THAT JUSTICE IS ONE OF THAT HIGHEST
CLASS OF GOODS WHICH ARE DESIRED INDEED FOR THEIR RESULTS BUT IN A FAR
GREATER DEGREE FOR THEIR OWN SAKES LIKE SIGHT OR HEARING OR KNOWLEDGE
OR HEALTH OR ANY OTHER REAL AND NATURAL AND NOT MERELY CONVENTIONAL
GOOD I WOULD ASK YOU IN YOUR PRAISE OF JUSTICE TO REGARD ONE POINT
ONLY I MEAN THE ESSENTIAL GOOD AND EVIL WHICH JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE
WORK IN THE POSSESSORS OF THEM
LET OTHERS PRAISE JUSTICE AND CENSURE
INJUSTICE MAGNIFYING THE REWARDS AND HONOURS OF THE ONE AND ABUSING THE
OTHER THAT IS A MANNER OF ARGUING WHICH COMING FROM THEM I AM
READY TO TOLERATE BUT FROM YOU WHO HAVE SPENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN THE
CONSIDERATION OF THIS QUESTION UNLESS I HEAR THE CONTRARY FROM YOUR OWN
LIPS I EXPECT SOMETHING BETTER
AND THEREFORE I SAY NOT ONLY PROVE TO
US THAT JUSTICE IS BETTER THAN INJUSTICE BUT SHOW WHAT THEY EITHER OF
THEM DO TO THE POSSESSOR OF THEM WHICH MAKES THE ONE TO BE A GOOD AND
THE OTHER AN EVIL WHETHER SEEN OR UNSEEN BY GODS AND MEN
I HAD ALWAYS ADMIRED THE GENIUS OF GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS BUT ON
HEARING THESE WORDS I WAS QUITE DELIGHTED AND SAID SONS OF AN
ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER THAT WAS NOT A BAD BEGINNING OF THE ELEGIAC VERSES
WHICH THE ADMIRER OF GLAUCON MADE IN HONOUR OF YOU AFTER YOU HAD
DISTINGUISHED YOURSELVES AT THE BATTLE OF MEGARA
'SONS OF ARISTON HE SANG 'DIVINE OFFSPRING OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS HERO
THE EPITHET IS VERY APPROPRIATE FOR THERE IS SOMETHING TRULY DIVINE IN
BEING ABLE TO ARGUE AS YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE SUPERIORITY OF INJUSTICE
AND REMAINING UNCONVINCED BY YOUR OWN ARGUMENTS
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT
YOU ARE NOT CONVINCED THIS I INFER FROM YOUR GENERAL CHARACTER FOR HAD
I JUDGED ONLY FROM YOUR SPEECHES I SHOULD HAVE MISTRUSTED YOU
BUT
NOW THE GREATER MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU THE GREATER IS MY DIFFICULTY IN
KNOWING WHAT TO SAY
FOR I AM IN A STRAIT BETWEEN TWO ON THE ONE HAND I
FEEL THAT I AM UNEQUAL TO THE TASK AND MY INABILITY IS BROUGHT HOME TO
ME BY THE FACT THAT YOU WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER WHICH I MADE
TO THRASYMACHUS PROVING AS I THOUGHT THE SUPERIORITY WHICH JUSTICE
HAS OVER INJUSTICE
AND YET I CANNOT REFUSE TO HELP WHILE BREATH AND
SPEECH REMAIN TO ME I AM AFRAID THAT THERE WOULD BE AN IMPIETY IN BEING
PRESENT WHEN JUSTICE IS EVIL SPOKEN OF AND NOT LIFTING UP A HAND IN HER
DEFENCE
AND THEREFORE I HAD BEST GIVE SUCH HELP AS I CAN
GLAUCON AND THE REST ENTREATED ME BY ALL MEANS NOT TO LET THE QUESTION
DROP BUT TO PROCEED IN THE INVESTIGATION
THEY WANTED TO ARRIVE AT THE
TRUTH FIRST ABOUT THE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE AND SECONDLY
ABOUT THEIR RELATIVE ADVANTAGES
I TOLD THEM WHAT I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT THE ENQUIRY WOULD BE OF A SERIOUS NATURE AND WOULD REQUIRE VERY
GOOD EYES
SEEING THEN I SAID THAT WE ARE NO GREAT WITS I THINK THAT
WE HAD BETTER ADOPT A METHOD WHICH I MAY ILLUSTRATE THUS SUPPOSE THAT
A SHORT SIGHTED PERSON HAD BEEN ASKED BY SOME ONE TO READ SMALL LETTERS
FROM A DISTANCE AND IT OCCURRED TO SOME ONE ELSE THAT THEY MIGHT BE
FOUND IN ANOTHER PLACE WHICH WAS LARGER AND IN WHICH THE LETTERS WERE
LARGER IF THEY WERE THE SAME AND HE COULD READ THE LARGER LETTERS
FIRST AND THEN PROCEED TO THE LESSER THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THOUGHT A
RARE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE
VERY TRUE SAID ADEIMANTUS BUT HOW DOES THE ILLUSTRATION APPLY TO OUR
ENQUIRY
I WILL TELL YOU I REPLIED JUSTICE WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF OUR
ENQUIRY IS AS YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SPOKEN OF AS THE VIRTUE OF AN
INDIVIDUAL AND SOMETIMES AS THE VIRTUE OF A STATE
TRUE HE REPLIED
AND IS NOT A STATE LARGER THAN AN INDIVIDUAL
IT IS
THEN IN THE LARGER THE QUANTITY OF JUSTICE IS LIKELY TO BE LARGER AND
MORE EASILY DISCERNIBLE
I PROPOSE THEREFORE THAT WE ENQUIRE INTO THE
NATURE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE FIRST AS THEY APPEAR IN THE STATE AND
SECONDLY IN THE INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDING FROM THE GREATER TO THE LESSER
AND COMPARING THEM
THAT HE SAID IS AN EXCELLENT PROPOSAL
AND IF WE IMAGINE THE STATE IN PROCESS OF CREATION WE SHALL SEE THE
JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE OF THE STATE IN PROCESS OF CREATION ALSO
I DARE SAY
WHEN THE STATE IS COMPLETED THERE MAY BE A HOPE THAT THE OBJECT OF OUR
SEARCH WILL BE MORE EASILY DISCOVERED
YES FAR MORE EASILY
BUT OUGHT WE TO ATTEMPT TO CONSTRUCT ONE I SAID FOR TO DO SO AS I AM
INCLINED TO THINK WILL BE A VERY SERIOUS TASK
REFLECT THEREFORE
I HAVE REFLECTED SAID ADEIMANTUS AND AM ANXIOUS THAT YOU SHOULD
PROCEED
A STATE I SAID ARISES AS I CONCEIVE OUT OF THE NEEDS OF MANKIND
NO ONE IS SELF SUFFICING BUT ALL OF US HAVE MANY WANTS
CAN ANY OTHER
ORIGIN OF A STATE BE IMAGINED
THERE CAN BE NO OTHER
THEN AS WE HAVE MANY WANTS AND MANY PERSONS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPLY THEM
ONE TAKES A HELPER FOR ONE PURPOSE AND ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER AND WHEN
THESE PARTNERS AND HELPERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER IN ONE HABITATION THE
BODY OF INHABITANTS IS TERMED A STATE
TRUE HE SAID
AND THEY EXCHANGE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ONE GIVES AND ANOTHER RECEIVES
UNDER THE IDEA THAT THE EXCHANGE WILL BE FOR THEIR GOOD
VERY TRUE
THEN I SAID LET US BEGIN AND CREATE IN IDEA A STATE AND YET THE TRUE
CREATOR IS NECESSITY WHO IS THE MOTHER OF OUR INVENTION
OF COURSE HE REPLIED
NOW THE FIRST AND GREATEST OF NECESSITIES IS FOOD WHICH IS THE
CONDITION OF LIFE AND EXISTENCE
CERTAINLY
THE SECOND IS A DWELLING AND THE THIRD CLOTHING AND THE LIKE
TRUE
AND NOW LET US SEE HOW OUR CITY WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPLY THIS GREAT
DEMAND WE MAY SUPPOSE THAT ONE MAN IS A HUSBANDMAN ANOTHER A BUILDER
SOME ONE ELSE A WEAVER SHALL WE ADD TO THEM A SHOEMAKER OR PERHAPS
SOME OTHER PURVEYOR TO OUR BODILY WANTS
QUITE RIGHT
THE BAREST NOTION OF A STATE MUST INCLUDE FOUR OR FIVE MEN
CLEARLY
AND HOW WILL THEY PROCEED WILL EACH BRING THE RESULT OF HIS LABOURS
INTO A COMMON STOCK THE INDIVIDUAL HUSBANDMAN FOR EXAMPLE PRODUCING
FOR FOUR AND LABOURING FOUR TIMES AS LONG AND AS MUCH AS HE NEED IN THE
PROVISION OF FOOD WITH WHICH HE SUPPLIES OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF
OR WILL HE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH OTHERS AND NOT BE AT THE TROUBLE OF
PRODUCING FOR THEM BUT PROVIDE FOR HIMSELF ALONE A FOURTH OF THE FOOD
IN A FOURTH OF THE TIME AND IN THE REMAINING THREE FOURTHS OF HIS TIME
BE EMPLOYED IN MAKING A HOUSE OR A COAT OR A PAIR OF SHOES HAVING NO
PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHERS BUT SUPPLYING HIMSELF ALL HIS OWN WANTS
ADEIMANTUS THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD AIM AT PRODUCING FOOD ONLY AND NOT AT
PRODUCING EVERYTHING
PROBABLY I REPLIED THAT WOULD BE THE BETTER WAY AND WHEN I HEAR YOU
SAY THIS I AM MYSELF REMINDED THAT WE ARE NOT ALL ALIKE THERE
ARE DIVERSITIES OF NATURES AMONG US WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT
OCCUPATIONS
VERY TRUE
AND WILL YOU HAVE A WORK BETTER DONE WHEN THE WORKMAN HAS MANY
OCCUPATIONS OR WHEN HE HAS ONLY ONE
WHEN HE HAS ONLY ONE
FURTHER THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT A WORK IS SPOILT WHEN NOT DONE AT
THE RIGHT TIME
NO DOUBT
FOR BUSINESS IS NOT DISPOSED TO WAIT UNTIL THE DOER OF THE BUSINESS IS
AT LEISURE BUT THE DOER MUST FOLLOW UP WHAT HE IS DOING AND MAKE THE
BUSINESS HIS FIRST OBJECT
HE MUST
AND IF SO WE MUST INFER THAT ALL THINGS ARE PRODUCED MORE PLENTIFULLY
AND EASILY AND OF A BETTER QUALITY WHEN ONE MAN DOES ONE THING WHICH IS
NATURAL TO HIM AND DOES IT AT THE RIGHT TIME AND LEAVES OTHER THINGS
UNDOUBTEDLY
THEN MORE THAN FOUR CITIZENS WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THE HUSBANDMAN WILL
NOT MAKE HIS OWN PLOUGH OR MATTOCK OR OTHER IMPLEMENTS OF AGRICULTURE
IF THEY ARE TO BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING
NEITHER WILL THE BUILDER MAKE
HIS TOOLS AND HE TOO NEEDS MANY AND IN LIKE MANNER THE WEAVER AND
SHOEMAKER
TRUE
THEN CARPENTERS AND SMITHS AND MANY OTHER ARTISANS WILL BE SHARERS IN
OUR LITTLE STATE WHICH IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW
TRUE
YET EVEN IF WE ADD NEATHERDS SHEPHERDS AND OTHER HERDSMEN IN ORDER
THAT OUR HUSBANDMEN MAY HAVE OXEN TO PLOUGH WITH AND BUILDERS AS WELL
AS HUSBANDMEN MAY HAVE DRAUGHT CATTLE AND CURRIERS AND WEAVERS FLEECES
AND HIDES STILL OUR STATE WILL NOT BE VERY LARGE
THAT IS TRUE YET NEITHER WILL IT BE A VERY SMALL STATE WHICH CONTAINS
ALL THESE
THEN AGAIN THERE IS THE SITUATION OF THE CITY TO FIND A PLACE WHERE
NOTHING NEED BE IMPORTED IS WELLNIGH IMPOSSIBLE
IMPOSSIBLE
THEN THERE MUST BE ANOTHER CLASS OF CITIZENS WHO WILL BRING THE REQUIRED
SUPPLY FROM ANOTHER CITY
THERE MUST
BUT IF THE TRADER GOES EMPTY HANDED HAVING NOTHING WHICH THEY REQUIRE
WHO WOULD SUPPLY HIS NEED HE WILL COME BACK EMPTY HANDED
THAT IS CERTAIN
AND THEREFORE WHAT THEY PRODUCE AT HOME MUST BE NOT ONLY ENOUGH FOR
THEMSELVES BUT SUCH BOTH IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY AS TO ACCOMMODATE
THOSE FROM WHOM THEIR WANTS ARE SUPPLIED
VERY TRUE
THEN MORE HUSBANDMEN AND MORE ARTISANS WILL BE REQUIRED
THEY WILL
NOT TO MENTION THE IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS WHO ARE CALLED MERCHANTS
YES
THEN WE SHALL WANT MERCHANTS
WE SHALL
AND IF MERCHANDISE IS TO BE CARRIED OVER THE SEA SKILFUL SAILORS WILL
ALSO BE NEEDED AND IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
YES IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
THEN AGAIN WITHIN THE CITY HOW WILL THEY EXCHANGE THEIR PRODUCTIONS
TO SECURE SUCH AN EXCHANGE WAS AS YOU WILL REMEMBER ONE OF OUR
PRINCIPAL OBJECTS WHEN WE FORMED THEM INTO A SOCIETY AND CONSTITUTED A
STATE
CLEARLY THEY WILL BUY AND SELL
THEN THEY WILL NEED A MARKET PLACE AND A MONEY TOKEN FOR PURPOSES OF
EXCHANGE
CERTAINLY
SUPPOSE NOW THAT A HUSBANDMAN OR AN ARTISAN BRINGS SOME PRODUCTION
TO MARKET AND HE COMES AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS NO ONE TO EXCHANGE WITH
HIM IS HE TO LEAVE HIS CALLING AND SIT IDLE IN THE MARKET PLACE
NOT AT ALL HE WILL FIND PEOPLE THERE WHO SEEING THE WANT UNDERTAKE
THE OFFICE OF SALESMEN
IN WELL ORDERED STATES THEY ARE COMMONLY THOSE
WHO ARE THE WEAKEST IN BODILY STRENGTH AND THEREFORE OF LITTLE USE FOR
ANY OTHER PURPOSE THEIR DUTY IS TO BE IN THE MARKET AND TO GIVE MONEY
IN EXCHANGE FOR GOODS TO THOSE WHO DESIRE TO SELL AND TO TAKE MONEY FROM
THOSE WHO DESIRE TO BUY
THIS WANT THEN CREATES A CLASS OF RETAIL TRADERS IN OUR STATE
IS
NOT 'RETAILER' THE TERM WHICH IS APPLIED TO THOSE WHO SIT IN THE
MARKET PLACE ENGAGED IN BUYING AND SELLING WHILE THOSE WHO WANDER FROM
ONE CITY TO ANOTHER ARE CALLED MERCHANTS
YES HE SAID
AND THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS OF SERVANTS WHO ARE INTELLECTUALLY HARDLY
ON THE LEVEL OF COMPANIONSHIP STILL THEY HAVE PLENTY OF BODILY STRENGTH
FOR LABOUR WHICH ACCORDINGLY THEY SELL AND ARE CALLED IF I DO NOT
MISTAKE HIRELINGS HIRE BEING THE NAME WHICH IS GIVEN TO THE PRICE OF
THEIR LABOUR
TRUE
THEN HIRELINGS WILL HELP TO MAKE UP OUR POPULATION
YES
AND NOW ADEIMANTUS IS OUR STATE MATURED AND PERFECTED
I THINK SO
WHERE THEN IS JUSTICE AND WHERE IS INJUSTICE AND IN WHAT PART OF THE
STATE DID THEY SPRING UP
PROBABLY IN THE DEALINGS OF THESE CITIZENS WITH ONE ANOTHER
I CANNOT
IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND ANY WHERE ELSE
I DARE SAY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT IN YOUR SUGGESTION I SAID WE HAD BETTER
THINK THE MATTER OUT AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE ENQUIRY
LET US THEN CONSIDER FIRST OF ALL WHAT WILL BE THEIR WAY OF LIFE
NOW THAT WE HAVE THUS ESTABLISHED THEM
WILL THEY NOT PRODUCE CORN AND
WINE AND CLOTHES AND SHOES AND BUILD HOUSES FOR THEMSELVES AND
WHEN THEY ARE HOUSED THEY WILL WORK IN SUMMER COMMONLY STRIPPED AND
BAREFOOT BUT IN WINTER SUBSTANTIALLY CLOTHED AND SHOD
THEY WILL FEED
ON BARLEY MEAL AND FLOUR OF WHEAT BAKING AND KNEADING THEM MAKING
NOBLE CAKES AND LOAVES THESE THEY WILL SERVE UP ON A MAT OF REEDS OR ON
CLEAN LEAVES THEMSELVES RECLINING THE WHILE UPON BEDS STREWN WITH YEW
OR MYRTLE
AND THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL FEAST DRINKING OF THE WINE
WHICH THEY HAVE MADE WEARING GARLANDS ON THEIR HEADS AND HYMNING THE
PRAISES OF THE GODS IN HAPPY CONVERSE WITH ONE ANOTHER
AND THEY WILL
TAKE CARE THAT THEIR FAMILIES DO NOT EXCEED THEIR MEANS HAVING AN EYE
TO POVERTY OR WAR
BUT SAID GLAUCON INTERPOSING YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN THEM A RELISH TO
THEIR MEAL
TRUE I REPLIED I HAD FORGOTTEN OF COURSE THEY MUST HAVE A
RELISH SALT AND OLIVES AND CHEESE AND THEY WILL BOIL ROOTS AND HERBS
SUCH AS COUNTRY PEOPLE PREPARE FOR A DESSERT WE SHALL GIVE THEM FIGS
AND PEAS AND BEANS AND THEY WILL ROAST MYRTLE BERRIES AND ACORNS
AT THE FIRE DRINKING IN MODERATION
AND WITH SUCH A DIET THEY MAY BE
EXPECTED TO LIVE IN PEACE AND HEALTH TO A GOOD OLD AGE AND BEQUEATH A
SIMILAR LIFE TO THEIR CHILDREN AFTER THEM
YES SOCRATES HE SAID AND IF YOU WERE PROVIDING FOR A CITY OF PIGS
HOW ELSE WOULD YOU FEED THE BEASTS
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE GLAUCON I REPLIED
WHY HE SAID YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM THE ORDINARY CONVENIENCES OF LIFE
PEOPLE WHO ARE TO BE COMFORTABLE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LIE ON SOFAS AND
DINE OFF TABLES AND THEY SHOULD HAVE SAUCES AND SWEETS IN THE MODERN
STYLE
YES I SAID NOW I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE ME
CONSIDER IS NOT ONLY HOW A STATE BUT HOW A LUXURIOUS STATE IS CREATED
AND POSSIBLY THERE IS NO HARM IN THIS FOR IN SUCH A STATE WE SHALL BE
MORE LIKELY TO SEE HOW JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE ORIGINATE
IN MY OPINION
THE TRUE AND HEALTHY CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE IS THE ONE WHICH I HAVE
DESCRIBED
BUT IF YOU WISH ALSO TO SEE A STATE AT FEVER HEAT I HAVE
NO OBJECTION
FOR I SUSPECT THAT MANY WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THE
SIMPLER WAY OF LIFE
THEY WILL BE FOR ADDING SOFAS AND TABLES
AND OTHER FURNITURE ALSO DAINTIES AND PERFUMES AND INCENSE AND
COURTESANS AND CAKES ALL THESE NOT OF ONE SORT ONLY BUT IN EVERY
VARIETY WE MUST GO BEYOND THE NECESSARIES OF WHICH I WAS AT FIRST
SPEAKING SUCH AS HOUSES AND CLOTHES AND SHOES THE ARTS OF THE
PAINTER AND THE EMBROIDERER WILL HAVE TO BE SET IN MOTION AND GOLD AND
IVORY AND ALL SORTS OF MATERIALS MUST BE PROCURED
TRUE HE SAID
THEN WE MUST ENLARGE OUR BORDERS FOR THE ORIGINAL HEALTHY STATE IS
NO LONGER SUFFICIENT
NOW WILL THE CITY HAVE TO FILL AND SWELL WITH A
MULTITUDE OF CALLINGS WHICH ARE NOT REQUIRED BY ANY NATURAL WANT SUCH
AS THE WHOLE TRIBE OF HUNTERS AND ACTORS OF WHOM ONE LARGE CLASS
HAVE TO DO WITH FORMS AND COLOURS ANOTHER WILL BE THE VOTARIES OF
MUSIC POETS AND THEIR ATTENDANT TRAIN OF RHAPSODISTS PLAYERS DANCERS
CONTRACTORS ALSO MAKERS OF DIVERS KINDS OF ARTICLES INCLUDING WOMEN'S
DRESSES
AND WE SHALL WANT MORE SERVANTS
WILL NOT TUTORS BE ALSO IN
REQUEST AND NURSES WET AND DRY TIREWOMEN AND BARBERS AS WELL AS
CONFECTIONERS AND COOKS AND SWINEHERDS TOO WHO WERE NOT NEEDED AND
THEREFORE HAD NO PLACE IN THE FORMER EDITION OF OUR STATE BUT ARE
NEEDED NOW THEY MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN AND THERE WILL BE ANIMALS OF
MANY OTHER KINDS IF PEOPLE EAT THEM
CERTAINLY
AND LIVING IN THIS WAY WE SHALL HAVE MUCH GREATER NEED OF PHYSICIANS
THAN BEFORE
MUCH GREATER
AND THE COUNTRY WHICH WAS ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL INHABITANTS
WILL BE TOO SMALL NOW AND NOT ENOUGH
QUITE TRUE
THEN A SLICE OF OUR NEIGHBOURS' LAND WILL BE WANTED BY US FOR PASTURE
AND TILLAGE AND THEY WILL WANT A SLICE OF OURS IF LIKE OURSELVES
THEY EXCEED THE LIMIT OF NECESSITY AND GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO THE
UNLIMITED ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH
THAT SOCRATES WILL BE INEVITABLE
AND SO WE SHALL GO TO WAR GLAUCON
SHALL WE NOT
MOST CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
THEN WITHOUT DETERMINING AS YET WHETHER WAR DOES GOOD OR HARM THUS MUCH
WE MAY AFFIRM THAT NOW WE HAVE DISCOVERED WAR TO BE DERIVED FROM CAUSES
WHICH ARE ALSO THE CAUSES OF ALMOST ALL THE EVILS IN STATES PRIVATE AS
WELL AS PUBLIC
UNDOUBTEDLY
AND OUR STATE MUST ONCE MORE ENLARGE AND THIS TIME THE ENLARGEMENT WILL
BE NOTHING SHORT OF A WHOLE ARMY WHICH WILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIGHT
WITH THE INVADERS FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE AS WELL AS FOR THE THINGS AND
PERSONS WHOM WE WERE DESCRIBING ABOVE
WHY HE SAID ARE THEY NOT CAPABLE OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES
NO I SAID NOT IF WE WERE RIGHT IN THE PRINCIPLE WHICH WAS ACKNOWLEDGED
BY ALL OF US WHEN WE WERE FRAMING THE STATE THE PRINCIPLE AS YOU WILL
REMEMBER WAS THAT ONE MAN CANNOT PRACTISE MANY ARTS WITH SUCCESS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
BUT IS NOT WAR AN ART
CERTAINLY
AND AN ART REQUIRING AS MUCH ATTENTION AS SHOEMAKING
QUITE TRUE
AND THE SHOEMAKER WAS NOT ALLOWED BY US TO BE A HUSBANDMAN OR A WEAVER
OR A BUILDER IN ORDER THAT WE MIGHT HAVE OUR SHOES WELL MADE BUT TO
HIM AND TO EVERY OTHER WORKER WAS ASSIGNED ONE WORK FOR WHICH HE WAS BY
NATURE FITTED AND AT THAT HE WAS TO CONTINUE WORKING ALL HIS LIFE LONG
AND AT NO OTHER HE WAS NOT TO LET OPPORTUNITIES SLIP AND THEN HE WOULD
BECOME A GOOD WORKMAN
NOW NOTHING CAN BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT
THE WORK OF A SOLDIER SHOULD BE WELL DONE
BUT IS WAR AN ART SO EASILY
ACQUIRED THAT A MAN MAY BE A WARRIOR WHO IS ALSO A HUSBANDMAN OR
SHOEMAKER OR OTHER ARTISAN ALTHOUGH NO ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD BE A
GOOD DICE OR DRAUGHT PLAYER WHO MERELY TOOK UP THE GAME AS A RECREATION
AND HAD NOT FROM HIS EARLIEST YEARS DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS AND NOTHING
ELSE NO TOOLS WILL MAKE A MAN A SKILLED WORKMAN OR MASTER OF DEFENCE
NOR BE OF ANY USE TO HIM WHO HAS NOT LEARNED HOW TO HANDLE THEM AND HAS
NEVER BESTOWED ANY ATTENTION UPON THEM
HOW THEN WILL HE WHO TAKES UP
A SHIELD OR OTHER IMPLEMENT OF WAR BECOME A GOOD FIGHTER ALL IN A DAY
WHETHER WITH HEAVY ARMED OR ANY OTHER KIND OF TROOPS
YES HE SAID THE TOOLS WHICH WOULD TEACH MEN THEIR OWN USE WOULD BE
BEYOND PRICE
AND THE HIGHER THE DUTIES OF THE GUARDIAN I SAID THE MORE TIME AND
SKILL AND ART AND APPLICATION WILL BE NEEDED BY HIM
NO DOUBT HE REPLIED
WILL HE NOT ALSO REQUIRE NATURAL APTITUDE FOR HIS CALLING
CERTAINLY
THEN IT WILL BE OUR DUTY TO SELECT IF WE CAN NATURES WHICH ARE FITTED
FOR THE TASK OF GUARDING THE CITY
IT WILL
AND THE SELECTION WILL BE NO EASY MATTER I SAID BUT WE MUST BE BRAVE
AND DO OUR BEST
WE MUST
IS NOT THE NOBLE YOUTH VERY LIKE A WELL BRED DOG IN RESPECT OF GUARDING
AND WATCHING
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN THAT BOTH OF THEM OUGHT TO BE QUICK TO SEE AND SWIFT TO OVERTAKE
THE ENEMY WHEN THEY SEE HIM AND STRONG TOO IF WHEN THEY HAVE CAUGHT
HIM THEY HAVE TO FIGHT WITH HIM
ALL THESE QUALITIES HE REPLIED WILL CERTAINLY BE REQUIRED BY THEM
WELL AND YOUR GUARDIAN MUST BE BRAVE IF HE IS TO FIGHT WELL
CERTAINLY
AND IS HE LIKELY TO BE BRAVE WHO HAS NO SPIRIT WHETHER HORSE OR DOG
OR ANY OTHER ANIMAL HAVE YOU NEVER OBSERVED HOW INVINCIBLE AND
UNCONQUERABLE IS SPIRIT AND HOW THE PRESENCE OF IT MAKES THE SOUL OF ANY
CREATURE TO BE ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS AND INDOMITABLE
I HAVE
THEN NOW WE HAVE A CLEAR NOTION OF THE BODILY QUALITIES WHICH ARE
REQUIRED IN THE GUARDIAN
TRUE
AND ALSO OF THE MENTAL ONES HIS SOUL IS TO BE FULL OF SPIRIT
YES
BUT ARE NOT THESE SPIRITED NATURES APT TO BE SAVAGE WITH ONE ANOTHER
AND WITH EVERYBODY ELSE
A DIFFICULTY BY NO MEANS EASY TO OVERCOME HE REPLIED
WHEREAS I SAID THEY OUGHT TO BE DANGEROUS TO THEIR ENEMIES AND GENTLE
TO THEIR FRIENDS IF NOT THEY WILL DESTROY THEMSELVES WITHOUT WAITING
FOR THEIR ENEMIES TO DESTROY THEM
TRUE HE SAID
WHAT IS TO BE DONE THEN I SAID HOW SHALL WE FIND A GENTLE NATURE WHICH
HAS ALSO A GREAT SPIRIT FOR THE ONE IS THE CONTRADICTION OF THE OTHER
TRUE
HE WILL NOT BE A GOOD GUARDIAN WHO IS WANTING IN EITHER OF THESE TWO
QUALITIES AND YET THE COMBINATION OF THEM APPEARS TO BE IMPOSSIBLE AND
HENCE WE MUST INFER THAT TO BE A GOOD GUARDIAN IS IMPOSSIBLE
I AM AFRAID THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE HE REPLIED
HERE FEELING PERPLEXED I BEGAN TO THINK OVER WHAT HAD PRECEDED MY
FRIEND I SAID NO WONDER THAT WE ARE IN A PERPLEXITY FOR WE HAVE LOST
SIGHT OF THE IMAGE WHICH WE HAD BEFORE US
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
I MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE DO EXIST NATURES GIFTED WITH THOSE OPPOSITE
QUALITIES
AND WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM
MANY ANIMALS I REPLIED FURNISH EXAMPLES OF THEM OUR FRIEND THE DOG
IS A VERY GOOD ONE YOU KNOW THAT WELL BRED DOGS ARE PERFECTLY GENTLE TO
THEIR FAMILIARS AND ACQUAINTANCES AND THE REVERSE TO STRANGERS
YES I KNOW
THEN THERE IS NOTHING IMPOSSIBLE OR OUT OF THE ORDER OF NATURE IN OUR
FINDING A GUARDIAN WHO HAS A SIMILAR COMBINATION OF QUALITIES
CERTAINLY NOT
WOULD NOT HE WHO IS FITTED TO BE A GUARDIAN BESIDES THE SPIRITED
NATURE NEED TO HAVE THE QUALITIES OF A PHILOSOPHER
I DO NOT APPREHEND YOUR MEANING
THE TRAIT OF WHICH I AM SPEAKING I REPLIED MAY BE ALSO SEEN IN THE
DOG AND IS REMARKABLE IN THE ANIMAL
WHAT TRAIT
WHY A DOG WHENEVER HE SEES A STRANGER IS ANGRY WHEN AN ACQUAINTANCE
HE WELCOMES HIM ALTHOUGH THE ONE HAS NEVER DONE HIM ANY HARM NOR THE
OTHER ANY GOOD
DID THIS NEVER STRIKE YOU AS CURIOUS
THE MATTER NEVER STRUCK ME BEFORE BUT I QUITE RECOGNISE THE TRUTH OF
YOUR REMARK
AND SURELY THIS INSTINCT OF THE DOG IS VERY CHARMING YOUR DOG IS A
TRUE PHILOSOPHER
WHY
WHY BECAUSE HE DISTINGUISHES THE FACE OF A FRIEND AND OF AN ENEMY ONLY
BY THE CRITERION OF KNOWING AND NOT KNOWING
AND MUST NOT AN ANIMAL BE A
LOVER OF LEARNING WHO DETERMINES WHAT HE LIKES AND DISLIKES BY THE TEST
OF KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE
MOST ASSUREDLY
AND IS NOT THE LOVE OF LEARNING THE LOVE OF WISDOM WHICH IS PHILOSOPHY
THEY ARE THE SAME HE REPLIED
AND MAY WE NOT SAY CONFIDENTLY OF MAN ALSO THAT HE WHO IS LIKELY TO BE
GENTLE TO HIS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES MUST BY NATURE BE A LOVER OF
WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE
THAT WE MAY SAFELY AFFIRM
THEN HE WHO IS TO BE A REALLY GOOD AND NOBLE GUARDIAN OF THE STATE WILL
REQUIRE TO UNITE IN HIMSELF PHILOSOPHY AND SPIRIT AND SWIFTNESS AND
STRENGTH
UNDOUBTEDLY
THEN WE HAVE FOUND THE DESIRED NATURES AND NOW THAT WE HAVE FOUND THEM
HOW ARE THEY TO BE REARED AND EDUCATED IS NOT THIS AN ENQUIRY WHICH
MAY BE EXPECTED TO THROW LIGHT ON THE GREATER ENQUIRY WHICH IS OUR FINAL
END HOW DO JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE GROW UP IN STATES FOR WE DO NOT WANT
EITHER TO OMIT WHAT IS TO THE POINT OR TO DRAW OUT THE ARGUMENT TO AN
INCONVENIENT LENGTH
ADEIMANTUS THOUGHT THAT THE ENQUIRY WOULD BE OF GREAT SERVICE TO US
THEN I SAID MY DEAR FRIEND THE TASK MUST NOT BE GIVEN UP EVEN IF
SOMEWHAT LONG
CERTAINLY NOT
COME THEN AND LET US PASS A LEISURE HOUR IN STORY TELLING AND OUR
STORY SHALL BE THE EDUCATION OF OUR HEROES
BY ALL MEANS
AND WHAT SHALL BE THEIR EDUCATION CAN WE FIND A BETTER THAN THE
TRADITIONAL SORT AND THIS HAS TWO DIVISIONS GYMNASTIC FOR THE BODY
AND MUSIC FOR THE SOUL
TRUE
SHALL WE BEGIN EDUCATION WITH MUSIC AND GO ON TO GYMNASTIC AFTERWARDS
BY ALL MEANS
AND WHEN YOU SPEAK OF MUSIC DO YOU INCLUDE LITERATURE OR NOT
I DO
AND LITERATURE MAY BE EITHER TRUE OR FALSE
YES
AND THE YOUNG SHOULD BE TRAINED IN BOTH KINDS AND WE BEGIN WITH THE
FALSE
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING HE SAID
YOU KNOW I SAID THAT WE BEGIN BY TELLING CHILDREN STORIES WHICH
THOUGH NOT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF TRUTH ARE IN THE MAIN FICTITIOUS
AND THESE STORIES ARE TOLD THEM WHEN THEY ARE NOT OF AN AGE TO LEARN
GYMNASTICS
VERY TRUE
THAT WAS MY MEANING WHEN I SAID THAT WE MUST TEACH MUSIC BEFORE
GYMNASTICS
QUITE RIGHT HE SAID
YOU KNOW ALSO THAT THE BEGINNING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY WORK
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF A YOUNG AND TENDER THING FOR THAT IS THE TIME
AT WHICH THE CHARACTER IS BEING FORMED AND THE DESIRED IMPRESSION IS
MORE READILY TAKEN
QUITE TRUE
AND SHALL WE JUST CARELESSLY ALLOW CHILDREN TO HEAR ANY CASUAL TALES
WHICH MAY BE DEVISED BY CASUAL PERSONS AND TO RECEIVE INTO THEIR MINDS
IDEAS FOR THE MOST PART THE VERY OPPOSITE OF THOSE WHICH WE SHOULD WISH
THEM TO HAVE WHEN THEY ARE GROWN UP
WE CANNOT
THEN THE FIRST THING WILL BE TO ESTABLISH A CENSORSHIP OF THE WRITERS OF
FICTION AND LET THE CENSORS RECEIVE ANY TALE OF FICTION WHICH IS GOOD
AND REJECT THE BAD AND WE WILL DESIRE MOTHERS AND NURSES TO TELL THEIR
CHILDREN THE AUTHORISED ONES ONLY
LET THEM FASHION THE MIND WITH SUCH
TALES EVEN MORE FONDLY THAN THEY MOULD THE BODY WITH THEIR HANDS BUT
MOST OF THOSE WHICH ARE NOW IN USE MUST BE DISCARDED
OF WHAT TALES ARE YOU SPEAKING HE SAID
YOU MAY FIND A MODEL OF THE LESSER IN THE GREATER I SAID FOR THEY ARE
NECESSARILY OF THE SAME TYPE AND THERE IS THE SAME SPIRIT IN BOTH OF
THEM
VERY LIKELY HE REPLIED BUT I DO NOT AS YET KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD TERM
THE GREATER
THOSE I SAID WHICH ARE NARRATED BY HOMER AND HESIOD AND THE REST OF
THE POETS WHO HAVE EVER BEEN THE GREAT STORY TELLERS OF MANKIND
BUT WHICH STORIES DO YOU MEAN HE SAID AND WHAT FAULT DO YOU FIND WITH
THEM
A FAULT WHICH IS MOST SERIOUS I SAID THE FAULT OF TELLING A LIE AND
WHAT IS MORE A BAD LIE
BUT WHEN IS THIS FAULT COMMITTED
WHENEVER AN ERRONEOUS REPRESENTATION IS MADE OF THE NATURE OF GODS AND
HEROES AS WHEN A PAINTER PAINTS A PORTRAIT NOT HAVING THE SHADOW OF A
LIKENESS TO THE ORIGINAL
YES HE SAID THAT SORT OF THING IS CERTAINLY VERY BLAMEABLE BUT WHAT
ARE THE STORIES WHICH YOU MEAN
FIRST OF ALL I SAID THERE WAS THAT GREATEST OF ALL LIES IN HIGH
PLACES WHICH THE POET TOLD ABOUT URANUS AND WHICH WAS A BAD LIE
TOO I MEAN WHAT HESIOD SAYS THAT URANUS DID AND HOW CRONUS RETALIATED
ON HIM
THE DOINGS OF CRONUS AND THE SUFFERINGS WHICH IN TURN HIS SON
INFLICTED UPON HIM EVEN IF THEY WERE TRUE OUGHT CERTAINLY NOT TO BE
LIGHTLY TOLD TO YOUNG AND THOUGHTLESS PERSONS IF POSSIBLE THEY HAD
BETTER BE BURIED IN SILENCE
BUT IF THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY
FOR THEIR MENTION A CHOSEN FEW MIGHT HEAR THEM IN A MYSTERY AND
THEY SHOULD SACRIFICE NOT A COMMON ELEUSINIAN PIG BUT SOME HUGE AND
UNPROCURABLE VICTIM AND THEN THE NUMBER OF THE HEARERS WILL BE VERY FEW
INDEED
WHY YES SAID HE THOSE STORIES ARE EXTREMELY OBJECTIONABLE
YES ADEIMANTUS THEY ARE STORIES NOT TO BE REPEATED IN OUR STATE THE
YOUNG MAN SHOULD NOT BE TOLD THAT IN COMMITTING THE WORST OF CRIMES HE
IS FAR FROM DOING ANYTHING OUTRAGEOUS AND THAT EVEN IF HE CHASTISES HIS
FATHER WHEN HE DOES WRONG IN WHATEVER MANNER HE WILL ONLY BE FOLLOWING
THE EXAMPLE OF THE FIRST AND GREATEST AMONG THE GODS
I ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOU HE SAID IN MY OPINION THOSE STORIES ARE
QUITE UNFIT TO BE REPEATED
NEITHER IF WE MEAN OUR FUTURE GUARDIANS TO REGARD THE HABIT OF
QUARRELLING AMONG THEMSELVES AS OF ALL THINGS THE BASEST SHOULD
ANY WORD BE SAID TO THEM OF THE WARS IN HEAVEN AND OF THE PLOTS AND
FIGHTINGS OF THE GODS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER FOR THEY ARE NOT TRUE
NO
WE SHALL NEVER MENTION THE BATTLES OF THE GIANTS OR LET THEM BE
EMBROIDERED ON GARMENTS AND WE SHALL BE SILENT ABOUT THE INNUMERABLE
OTHER QUARRELS OF GODS AND HEROES WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES
IF THEY WOULD ONLY BELIEVE US WE WOULD TELL THEM THAT QUARRELLING
IS UNHOLY AND THAT NEVER UP TO THIS TIME HAS THERE BEEN ANY QUARREL
BETWEEN CITIZENS THIS IS WHAT OLD MEN AND OLD WOMEN SHOULD BEGIN BY
TELLING CHILDREN AND WHEN THEY GROW UP THE POETS ALSO SHOULD BE TOLD
TO COMPOSE FOR THEM IN A SIMILAR SPIRIT
BUT THE NARRATIVE OF HEPHAESTUS
BINDING HERE HIS MOTHER OR HOW ON ANOTHER OCCASION ZEUS SENT HIM FLYING
FOR TAKING HER PART WHEN SHE WAS BEING BEATEN AND ALL THE BATTLES OF
THE GODS IN HOMER THESE TALES MUST NOT BE ADMITTED INTO OUR STATE
WHETHER THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AN ALLEGORICAL MEANING OR NOT
FOR
A YOUNG PERSON CANNOT JUDGE WHAT IS ALLEGORICAL AND WHAT IS LITERAL
ANYTHING THAT HE RECEIVES INTO HIS MIND AT THAT AGE IS LIKELY TO BECOME
INDELIBLE AND UNALTERABLE AND THEREFORE IT IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT THE
TALES WHICH THE YOUNG FIRST HEAR SHOULD BE MODELS OF VIRTUOUS THOUGHTS
THERE YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED BUT IF ANY ONE ASKS WHERE ARE SUCH
MODELS TO BE FOUND AND OF WHAT TALES ARE YOU SPEAKING HOW SHALL WE
ANSWER HIM
I SAID TO HIM YOU AND I ADEIMANTUS AT THIS MOMENT ARE NOT POETS
BUT FOUNDERS OF A STATE NOW THE FOUNDERS OF A STATE OUGHT TO KNOW THE
GENERAL FORMS IN WHICH POETS SHOULD CAST THEIR TALES AND THE LIMITS
WHICH MUST BE OBSERVED BY THEM BUT TO MAKE THE TALES IS NOT THEIR
BUSINESS
VERY TRUE HE SAID BUT WHAT ARE THESE FORMS OF THEOLOGY WHICH YOU MEAN
SOMETHING OF THIS KIND I REPLIED GOD IS ALWAYS TO BE REPRESENTED AS
HE TRULY IS WHATEVER BE THE SORT OF POETRY EPIC LYRIC OR TRAGIC IN
WHICH THE REPRESENTATION IS GIVEN
RIGHT
AND IS HE NOT TRULY GOOD AND MUST HE NOT BE REPRESENTED AS SUCH
CERTAINLY
AND NO GOOD THING IS HURTFUL
NO INDEED
AND THAT WHICH IS NOT HURTFUL HURTS NOT
CERTAINLY NOT
AND THAT WHICH HURTS NOT DOES NO EVIL
NO
AND CAN THAT WHICH DOES NO EVIL BE A CAUSE OF EVIL
IMPOSSIBLE
AND THE GOOD IS ADVANTAGEOUS
YES
AND THEREFORE THE CAUSE OF WELL BEING
YES
IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE GOOD IS NOT THE CAUSE OF ALL THINGS BUT
OF THE GOOD ONLY
ASSUREDLY
THEN GOD IF HE BE GOOD IS NOT THE AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS AS THE MANY
ASSERT BUT HE IS THE CAUSE OF A FEW THINGS ONLY AND NOT OF MOST THINGS
THAT OCCUR TO MEN
FOR FEW ARE THE GOODS OF HUMAN LIFE AND MANY ARE THE
EVILS AND THE GOOD IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO GOD ALONE OF THE EVILS THE
CAUSES ARE TO BE SOUGHT ELSEWHERE AND NOT IN HIM
THAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE MOST TRUE HE SAID
THEN WE MUST NOT LISTEN TO HOMER OR TO ANY OTHER POET WHO IS GUILTY OF
THE FOLLY OF SAYING THAT TWO CASKS
'LIE AT THE THRESHOLD OF ZEUS FULL OF LOTS ONE OF GOOD THE OTHER OF
EVIL LOTS
AND THAT HE TO WHOM ZEUS GIVES A MIXTURE OF THE TWO
'SOMETIMES MEETS WITH EVIL FORTUNE AT OTHER TIMES WITH GOOD
BUT THAT HE TO WHOM IS GIVEN THE CUP OF UNMINGLED ILL
'HIM WILD HUNGER DRIVES O'ER THE BEAUTEOUS EARTH
AND AGAIN
'ZEUS WHO IS THE DISPENSER OF GOOD AND EVIL TO US
AND IF ANY ONE ASSERTS THAT THE VIOLATION OF OATHS AND TREATIES WHICH
WAS REALLY THE WORK OF PANDARUS WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY ATHENE AND ZEUS
OR THAT THE STRIFE AND CONTENTION OF THE GODS WAS INSTIGATED BY THEMIS
AND ZEUS HE SHALL NOT HAVE OUR APPROVAL NEITHER WILL WE ALLOW OUR
YOUNG MEN TO HEAR THE WORDS OF AESCHYLUS THAT
'GOD PLANTS GUILT AMONG MEN WHEN HE DESIRES UTTERLY TO DESTROY A HOUSE
AND IF A POET WRITES OF THE SUFFERINGS OF NIOBE THE SUBJECT OF THE
TRAGEDY IN WHICH THESE IAMBIC VERSES OCCUR OR OF THE HOUSE OF PELOPS
OR OF THE TROJAN WAR OR ON ANY SIMILAR THEME EITHER WE MUST NOT PERMIT
HIM TO SAY THAT THESE ARE THE WORKS OF GOD OR IF THEY ARE OF GOD HE
MUST DEVISE SOME EXPLANATION OF THEM SUCH AS WE ARE SEEKING HE MUST SAY
THAT GOD DID WHAT WAS JUST AND RIGHT AND THEY WERE THE BETTER FOR BEING
PUNISHED BUT THAT THOSE WHO ARE PUNISHED ARE MISERABLE AND THAT GOD
IS THE AUTHOR OF THEIR MISERY THE POET IS NOT TO BE PERMITTED TO SAY
THOUGH HE MAY SAY THAT THE WICKED ARE MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE
TO BE PUNISHED AND ARE BENEFITED BY RECEIVING PUNISHMENT FROM GOD
BUT THAT GOD BEING GOOD IS THE AUTHOR OF EVIL TO ANY ONE IS TO BE
STRENUOUSLY DENIED AND NOT TO BE SAID OR SUNG OR HEARD IN VERSE OR
PROSE BY ANY ONE WHETHER OLD OR YOUNG IN ANY WELL ORDERED COMMONWEALTH
SUCH A FICTION IS SUICIDAL RUINOUS IMPIOUS
I AGREE WITH YOU HE REPLIED AND AM READY TO GIVE MY ASSENT TO THE LAW
LET THIS THEN BE ONE OF OUR RULES AND PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE GODS TO
WHICH OUR POETS AND RECITERS WILL BE EXPECTED TO CONFORM THAT GOD IS
NOT THE AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS BUT OF GOOD ONLY
THAT WILL DO HE SAID
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A SECOND PRINCIPLE SHALL I ASK YOU WHETHER GOD
IS A MAGICIAN AND OF A NATURE TO APPEAR INSIDIOUSLY NOW IN ONE SHAPE
AND NOW IN ANOTHER SOMETIMES HIMSELF CHANGING AND PASSING INTO
MANY FORMS SOMETIMES DECEIVING US WITH THE SEMBLANCE OF SUCH
TRANSFORMATIONS OR IS HE ONE AND THE SAME IMMUTABLY FIXED IN HIS OWN
PROPER IMAGE
I CANNOT ANSWER YOU HE SAID WITHOUT MORE THOUGHT
WELL I SAID BUT IF WE SUPPOSE A CHANGE IN ANYTHING THAT CHANGE MUST
BE EFFECTED EITHER BY THE THING ITSELF OR BY SOME OTHER THING
MOST CERTAINLY
AND THINGS WHICH ARE AT THEIR BEST ARE ALSO LEAST LIABLE TO BE ALTERED
OR DISCOMPOSED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN HEALTHIEST AND STRONGEST THE HUMAN
FRAME IS LEAST LIABLE TO BE AFFECTED BY MEATS AND DRINKS AND THE PLANT
WHICH IS IN THE FULLEST VIGOUR ALSO SUFFERS LEAST FROM WINDS OR THE HEAT
OF THE SUN OR ANY SIMILAR CAUSES
OF COURSE
AND WILL NOT THE BRAVEST AND WISEST SOUL BE LEAST CONFUSED OR DERANGED
BY ANY EXTERNAL INFLUENCE
TRUE
AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS I SHOULD SUPPOSE APPLIES TO ALL COMPOSITE
THINGS FURNITURE HOUSES GARMENTS WHEN GOOD AND WELL MADE THEY ARE
LEAST ALTERED BY TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCES
VERY TRUE
THEN EVERYTHING WHICH IS GOOD WHETHER MADE BY ART OR NATURE OR BOTH
IS LEAST LIABLE TO SUFFER CHANGE FROM WITHOUT
TRUE
BUT SURELY GOD AND THE THINGS OF GOD ARE IN EVERY WAY PERFECT
OF COURSE THEY ARE
THEN HE CAN HARDLY BE COMPELLED BY EXTERNAL INFLUENCE TO TAKE MANY
SHAPES
HE CANNOT
BUT MAY HE NOT CHANGE AND TRANSFORM HIMSELF
CLEARLY HE SAID THAT MUST BE THE CASE IF HE IS CHANGED AT ALL
AND WILL HE THEN CHANGE HIMSELF FOR THE BETTER AND FAIRER OR FOR THE
WORSE AND MORE UNSIGHTLY
IF HE CHANGE AT ALL HE CAN ONLY CHANGE FOR THE WORSE FOR WE CANNOT
SUPPOSE HIM TO BE DEFICIENT EITHER IN VIRTUE OR BEAUTY
VERY TRUE ADEIMANTUS BUT THEN WOULD ANY ONE WHETHER GOD OR MAN
DESIRE TO MAKE HIMSELF WORSE
IMPOSSIBLE
THEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT GOD SHOULD EVER BE WILLING TO CHANGE BEING
AS IS SUPPOSED THE FAIREST AND BEST THAT IS CONCEIVABLE EVERY GOD
REMAINS ABSOLUTELY AND FOR EVER IN HIS OWN FORM
THAT NECESSARILY FOLLOWS HE SAID IN MY JUDGMENT
THEN I SAID MY DEAR FRIEND LET NONE OF THE POETS TELL US THAT
'THE GODS TAKING THE DISGUISE OF STRANGERS FROM OTHER LANDS WALK UP
AND DOWN CITIES IN ALL SORTS OF FORMS
AND LET NO ONE SLANDER PROTEUS AND THETIS NEITHER LET ANY ONE EITHER
IN TRAGEDY OR IN ANY OTHER KIND OF POETRY INTRODUCE HERE DISGUISED IN
THE LIKENESS OF A PRIESTESS ASKING AN ALMS
'FOR THE LIFE GIVING DAUGHTERS OF INACHUS THE RIVER OF ARGOS
LET US HAVE NO MORE LIES OF THAT SORT
NEITHER MUST WE HAVE MOTHERS
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE POETS SCARING THEIR CHILDREN WITH A BAD
VERSION OF THESE MYTHS TELLING HOW CERTAIN GODS AS THEY SAY 'GO ABOUT
BY NIGHT IN THE LIKENESS OF SO MANY STRANGERS AND IN DIVERS FORMS BUT
LET THEM TAKE HEED LEST THEY MAKE COWARDS OF THEIR CHILDREN AND AT THE
SAME TIME SPEAK BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE GODS
HEAVEN FORBID HE SAID
BUT ALTHOUGH THE GODS ARE THEMSELVES UNCHANGEABLE STILL BY WITCHCRAFT
AND DECEPTION THEY MAY MAKE US THINK THAT THEY APPEAR IN VARIOUS FORMS
PERHAPS HE REPLIED
WELL BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT GOD WILL BE WILLING TO LIE WHETHER IN
WORD OR DEED OR TO PUT FORTH A PHANTOM OF HIMSELF
I CANNOT SAY HE REPLIED
DO YOU NOT KNOW I SAID THAT THE TRUE LIE IF SUCH AN EXPRESSION MAY BE
ALLOWED IS HATED OF GODS AND MEN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
I MEAN THAT NO ONE IS WILLINGLY DECEIVED IN THAT WHICH IS THE TRUEST AND
HIGHEST PART OF HIMSELF OR ABOUT THE TRUEST AND HIGHEST MATTERS THERE
ABOVE ALL HE IS MOST AFRAID OF A LIE HAVING POSSESSION OF HIM
STILL HE SAID I DO NOT COMPREHEND YOU
THE REASON IS I REPLIED THAT YOU ATTRIBUTE SOME PROFOUND MEANING TO
MY WORDS BUT I AM ONLY SAYING THAT DECEPTION OR BEING DECEIVED
OR UNINFORMED ABOUT THE HIGHEST REALITIES IN THE HIGHEST PART OF
THEMSELVES WHICH IS THE SOUL AND IN THAT PART OF THEM TO HAVE AND TO
HOLD THE LIE IS WHAT MANKIND LEAST LIKE THAT I SAY IS WHAT THEY
UTTERLY DETEST
THERE IS NOTHING MORE HATEFUL TO THEM
AND AS I WAS JUST NOW REMARKING THIS IGNORANCE IN THE SOUL OF HIM WHO
IS DECEIVED MAY BE CALLED THE TRUE LIE FOR THE LIE IN WORDS IS ONLY A
KIND OF IMITATION AND SHADOWY IMAGE OF A PREVIOUS AFFECTION OF THE SOUL
NOT PURE UNADULTERATED FALSEHOOD
AM I NOT RIGHT
PERFECTLY RIGHT
THE TRUE LIE IS HATED NOT ONLY BY THE GODS BUT ALSO BY MEN
YES
WHEREAS THE LIE IN WORDS IS IN CERTAIN CASES USEFUL AND NOT HATEFUL IN
DEALING WITH ENEMIES THAT WOULD BE AN INSTANCE OR AGAIN WHEN THOSE
WHOM WE CALL OUR FRIENDS IN A FIT OF MADNESS OR ILLUSION ARE GOING TO
DO SOME HARM THEN IT IS USEFUL AND IS A SORT OF MEDICINE OR
PREVENTIVE ALSO IN THE TALES OF MYTHOLOGY OF WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW
SPEAKING BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT ANCIENT TIMES WE MAKE
FALSEHOOD AS MUCH LIKE TRUTH AS WE CAN AND SO TURN IT TO ACCOUNT
VERY TRUE HE SAID
BUT CAN ANY OF THESE REASONS APPLY TO GOD CAN WE SUPPOSE THAT HE IS
IGNORANT OF ANTIQUITY AND THEREFORE HAS RECOURSE TO INVENTION
THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS HE SAID
THEN THE LYING POET HAS NO PLACE IN OUR IDEA OF GOD
I SHOULD SAY NOT
OR PERHAPS HE MAY TELL A LIE BECAUSE HE IS AFRAID OF ENEMIES
THAT IS INCONCEIVABLE
BUT HE MAY HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE SENSELESS OR MAD
BUT NO MAD OR SENSELESS PERSON CAN BE A FRIEND OF GOD
THEN NO MOTIVE CAN BE IMAGINED WHY GOD SHOULD LIE
NONE WHATEVER
THEN THE SUPERHUMAN AND DIVINE IS ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE OF FALSEHOOD
YES
THEN IS GOD PERFECTLY SIMPLE AND TRUE BOTH IN WORD AND DEED HE CHANGES
NOT HE DECEIVES NOT EITHER BY SIGN OR WORD BY DREAM OR WAKING VISION
YOUR THOUGHTS HE SAID ARE THE REFLECTION OF MY OWN
YOU AGREE WITH ME THEN I SAID THAT THIS IS THE SECOND TYPE OR FORM IN
WHICH WE SHOULD WRITE AND SPEAK ABOUT DIVINE THINGS
THE GODS ARE NOT
MAGICIANS WHO TRANSFORM THEMSELVES NEITHER DO THEY DECEIVE MANKIND IN
ANY WAY
I GRANT THAT
THEN ALTHOUGH WE ARE ADMIRERS OF HOMER WE DO NOT ADMIRE THE LYING
DREAM WHICH ZEUS SENDS TO AGAMEMNON NEITHER WILL WE PRAISE THE VERSES
OF AESCHYLUS IN WHICH THETIS SAYS THAT APOLLO AT HER NUPTIALS
'WAS CELEBRATING IN SONG HER FAIR PROGENY WHOSE DAYS WERE TO BE LONG
AND TO KNOW NO SICKNESS
AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF MY LOT AS IN ALL
THINGS BLESSED OF HEAVEN HE RAISED A NOTE OF TRIUMPH AND CHEERED MY
SOUL
AND I THOUGHT THAT THE WORD OF PHOEBUS BEING DIVINE AND FULL OF
PROPHECY WOULD NOT FAIL
AND NOW HE HIMSELF WHO UTTERED THE STRAIN
HE WHO WAS PRESENT AT THE BANQUET AND WHO SAID THIS HE IT IS WHO HAS
SLAIN MY SON
THESE ARE THE KIND OF SENTIMENTS ABOUT THE GODS WHICH WILL AROUSE OUR
ANGER AND HE WHO UTTERS THEM SHALL BE REFUSED A CHORUS NEITHER SHALL
WE ALLOW TEACHERS TO MAKE USE OF THEM IN THE INSTRUCTION OF THE YOUNG
MEANING AS WE DO THAT OUR GUARDIANS AS FAR AS MEN CAN BE SHOULD BE
TRUE WORSHIPPERS OF THE GODS AND LIKE THEM
I ENTIRELY AGREE HE SAID IN THESE PRINCIPLES AND PROMISE TO MAKE THEM
MY LAWS
BOOK III
SUCH THEN I SAID ARE OUR PRINCIPLES OF THEOLOGY SOME TALES ARE TO BE
TOLD AND OTHERS ARE NOT TO BE TOLD TO OUR DISCIPLES FROM THEIR YOUTH
UPWARDS IF WE MEAN THEM TO HONOUR THE GODS AND THEIR PARENTS AND TO
VALUE FRIENDSHIP WITH ONE ANOTHER
YES AND I THINK THAT OUR PRINCIPLES ARE RIGHT HE SAID
BUT IF THEY ARE TO BE COURAGEOUS MUST THEY NOT LEARN OTHER LESSONS
BESIDES THESE AND LESSONS OF SUCH A KIND AS WILL TAKE AWAY THE FEAR OF
DEATH CAN ANY MAN BE COURAGEOUS WHO HAS THE FEAR OF DEATH IN HIM
CERTAINLY NOT HE SAID
AND CAN HE BE FEARLESS OF DEATH OR WILL HE CHOOSE DEATH IN BATTLE
RATHER THAN DEFEAT AND SLAVERY WHO BELIEVES THE WORLD BELOW TO BE REAL
AND TERRIBLE
IMPOSSIBLE
THEN WE MUST ASSUME A CONTROL OVER THE NARRATORS OF THIS CLASS OF TALES
AS WELL AS OVER THE OTHERS AND BEG THEM NOT SIMPLY TO REVILE BUT RATHER
TO COMMEND THE WORLD BELOW INTIMATING TO THEM THAT THEIR DESCRIPTIONS
ARE UNTRUE AND WILL DO HARM TO OUR FUTURE WARRIORS
THAT WILL BE OUR DUTY HE SAID
THEN I SAID WE SHALL HAVE TO OBLITERATE MANY OBNOXIOUS PASSAGES
BEGINNING WITH THE VERSES
'I WOULD RATHER BE A SERF ON THE LAND OF A POOR AND PORTIONLESS MAN THAN
RULE OVER ALL THE DEAD WHO HAVE COME TO NOUGHT
WE MUST ALSO EXPUNGE THE VERSE WHICH TELLS US HOW PLUTO FEARED
'LEST THE MANSIONS GRIM AND SQUALID WHICH THE GODS ABHOR SHOULD BE SEEN
BOTH OF MORTALS AND IMMORTALS
AND AGAIN
'O HEAVENS VERILY IN THE HOUSE OF HADES THERE IS SOUL AND GHOSTLY FORM
BUT NO MIND AT ALL
AGAIN OF TIRESIAS
TO HIM EVEN AFTER DEATH DID PERSEPHONE GRANT MIND THAT HE ALONE
SHOULD BE WISE BUT THE OTHER SOULS ARE FLITTING SHADES
AGAIN
'THE SOUL FLYING FROM THE LIMBS HAD GONE TO HADES LAMENTING HER FATE
LEAVING MANHOOD AND YOUTH
AGAIN
'AND THE SOUL WITH SHRILLING CRY PASSED LIKE SMOKE BENEATH THE EARTH
AND
'AS BATS IN HOLLOW OF MYSTIC CAVERN WHENEVER ANY OF THEM HAS DROPPED
OUT OF THE STRING AND FALLS FROM THE ROCK FLY SHRILLING AND CLING
TO ONE ANOTHER SO DID THEY WITH SHRILLING CRY HOLD TOGETHER AS THEY
MOVED
AND WE MUST BEG HOMER AND THE OTHER POETS NOT TO BE ANGRY IF WE STRIKE
OUT THESE AND SIMILAR PASSAGES NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE UNPOETICAL OR
UNATTRACTIVE TO THE POPULAR EAR BUT BECAUSE THE GREATER THE POETICAL
CHARM OF THEM THE LESS ARE THEY MEET FOR THE EARS OF BOYS AND MEN WHO
ARE MEANT TO BE FREE AND WHO SHOULD FEAR SLAVERY MORE THAN DEATH
UNDOUBTEDLY
ALSO WE SHALL HAVE TO REJECT ALL THE TERRIBLE AND APPALLING NAMES WHICH
DESCRIBE THE WORLD BELOW COCYTUS AND STYX GHOSTS UNDER THE EARTH AND
SAPLESS SHADES AND ANY SIMILAR WORDS OF WHICH THE VERY MENTION CAUSES A
SHUDDER TO PASS THROUGH THE INMOST SOUL OF HIM WHO HEARS THEM
I DO NOT
SAY THAT THESE HORRIBLE STORIES MAY NOT HAVE A USE OF SOME KIND BUT
THERE IS A DANGER THAT THE NERVES OF OUR GUARDIANS MAY BE RENDERED TOO
EXCITABLE AND EFFEMINATE BY THEM
THERE IS A REAL DANGER HE SAID
THEN WE MUST HAVE NO MORE OF THEM
TRUE
ANOTHER AND A NOBLER STRAIN MUST BE COMPOSED AND SUNG BY US
CLEARLY
AND SHALL WE PROCEED TO GET RID OF THE WEEPINGS AND WAILINGS OF FAMOUS
MEN
THEY WILL GO WITH THE REST
BUT SHALL WE BE RIGHT IN GETTING RID OF THEM REFLECT OUR PRINCIPLE IS
THAT THE GOOD MAN WILL NOT CONSIDER DEATH TERRIBLE TO ANY OTHER GOOD MAN
WHO IS HIS COMRADE
YES THAT IS OUR PRINCIPLE
AND THEREFORE HE WILL NOT SORROW FOR HIS DEPARTED FRIEND AS THOUGH HE
HAD SUFFERED ANYTHING TERRIBLE
HE WILL NOT
SUCH AN ONE AS WE FURTHER MAINTAIN IS SUFFICIENT FOR HIMSELF AND HIS
OWN HAPPINESS AND THEREFORE IS LEAST IN NEED OF OTHER MEN
TRUE HE SAID
AND FOR THIS REASON THE LOSS OF A SON OR BROTHER OR THE DEPRIVATION OF
FORTUNE IS TO HIM OF ALL MEN LEAST TERRIBLE
ASSUREDLY
AND THEREFORE HE WILL BE LEAST LIKELY TO LAMENT AND WILL BEAR WITH THE
GREATEST EQUANIMITY ANY MISFORTUNE OF THIS SORT WHICH MAY BEFALL HIM
YES HE WILL FEEL SUCH A MISFORTUNE FAR LESS THAN ANOTHER
THEN WE SHALL BE RIGHT IN GETTING RID OF THE LAMENTATIONS OF FAMOUS MEN
AND MAKING THEM OVER TO WOMEN AND NOT EVEN TO WOMEN WHO ARE GOOD FOR
ANYTHING OR TO MEN OF A BASER SORT THAT THOSE WHO ARE BEING EDUCATED
BY US TO BE THE DEFENDERS OF THEIR COUNTRY MAY SCORN TO DO THE LIKE
THAT WILL BE VERY RIGHT
THEN WE WILL ONCE MORE ENTREAT HOMER AND THE OTHER POETS NOT TO DEPICT
ACHILLES WHO IS THE SON OF A GODDESS FIRST LYING ON HIS SIDE THEN ON
HIS BACK AND THEN ON HIS FACE THEN STARTING UP AND SAILING IN A FRENZY
ALONG THE SHORES OF THE BARREN SEA NOW TAKING THE SOOTY ASHES IN BOTH
HIS HANDS AND POURING THEM OVER HIS HEAD OR WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE
VARIOUS MODES WHICH HOMER HAS DELINEATED
NOR SHOULD HE DESCRIBE PRIAM
THE KINSMAN OF THE GODS AS PRAYING AND BESEECHING
'ROLLING IN THE DIRT CALLING EACH MAN LOUDLY BY HIS NAME
STILL MORE EARNESTLY WILL WE BEG OF HIM AT ALL EVENTS NOT TO INTRODUCE
THE GODS LAMENTING AND SAYING
'ALAS MY MISERY ALAS THAT I BORE THE BRAVEST TO MY SORROW
BUT IF HE MUST INTRODUCE THE GODS AT ANY RATE LET HIM NOT DARE SO
COMPLETELY TO MISREPRESENT THE GREATEST OF THE GODS AS TO MAKE HIM
SAY
'O HEAVENS WITH MY EYES VERILY I BEHOLD A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE CHASED
ROUND AND ROUND THE CITY AND MY HEART IS SORROWFUL
OR AGAIN
WOE IS ME THAT I AM FATED TO HAVE SARPEDON DEAREST OF MEN TO ME
SUBDUED AT THE HANDS OF PATROCLUS THE SON OF MENOETIUS
FOR IF MY SWEET ADEIMANTUS OUR YOUTH SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO SUCH UNWORTHY
REPRESENTATIONS OF THE GODS INSTEAD OF LAUGHING AT THEM AS THEY OUGHT
HARDLY WILL ANY OF THEM DEEM THAT HE HIMSELF BEING BUT A MAN CAN BE
DISHONOURED BY SIMILAR ACTIONS NEITHER WILL HE REBUKE ANY INCLINATION
WHICH MAY ARISE IN HIS MIND TO SAY AND DO THE LIKE
AND INSTEAD
OF HAVING ANY SHAME OR SELF CONTROL HE WILL BE ALWAYS WHINING AND
LAMENTING ON SLIGHT OCCASIONS
YES HE SAID THAT IS MOST TRUE
YES I REPLIED BUT THAT SURELY IS WHAT OUGHT NOT TO BE AS THE ARGUMENT
HAS JUST PROVED TO US AND BY THAT PROOF WE MUST ABIDE UNTIL IT IS
DISPROVED BY A BETTER
IT OUGHT NOT TO BE
NEITHER OUGHT OUR GUARDIANS TO BE GIVEN TO LAUGHTER
FOR A FIT OF
LAUGHTER WHICH HAS BEEN INDULGED TO EXCESS ALMOST ALWAYS PRODUCES A
VIOLENT REACTION
SO I BELIEVE
THEN PERSONS OF WORTH EVEN IF ONLY MORTAL MEN MUST NOT BE REPRESENTED
AS OVERCOME BY LAUGHTER AND STILL LESS MUST SUCH A REPRESENTATION OF
THE GODS BE ALLOWED
STILL LESS OF THE GODS AS YOU SAY HE REPLIED
THEN WE SHALL NOT SUFFER SUCH AN EXPRESSION TO BE USED ABOUT THE GODS AS
THAT OF HOMER WHEN HE DESCRIBES HOW
'INEXTINGUISHABLE LAUGHTER AROSE AMONG THE BLESSED GODS WHEN THEY SAW
HEPHAESTUS BUSTLING ABOUT THE MANSION
ON YOUR VIEWS WE MUST NOT ADMIT THEM
ON MY VIEWS IF YOU LIKE TO FATHER THEM ON ME THAT WE MUST NOT ADMIT
THEM IS CERTAIN
AGAIN TRUTH SHOULD BE HIGHLY VALUED IF AS WE WERE SAYING A LIE IS
USELESS TO THE GODS AND USEFUL ONLY AS A MEDICINE TO MEN THEN THE
USE OF SUCH MEDICINES SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO PHYSICIANS PRIVATE
INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THEM
CLEARLY NOT HE SAID
THEN IF ANY ONE AT ALL IS TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF LYING THE RULERS OF
THE STATE SHOULD BE THE PERSONS AND THEY IN THEIR DEALINGS EITHER WITH
ENEMIES OR WITH THEIR OWN CITIZENS MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIE FOR THE PUBLIC
GOOD
BUT NOBODY ELSE SHOULD MEDDLE WITH ANYTHING OF THE KIND AND
ALTHOUGH THE RULERS HAVE THIS PRIVILEGE FOR A PRIVATE MAN TO LIE TO
THEM IN RETURN IS TO BE DEEMED A MORE HEINOUS FAULT THAN FOR THE PATIENT
OR THE PUPIL OF A GYMNASIUM NOT TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS OWN BODILY
ILLNESSES TO THE PHYSICIAN OR TO THE TRAINER OR FOR A SAILOR NOT TO
TELL THE CAPTAIN WHAT IS HAPPENING ABOUT THE SHIP AND THE REST OF THE
CREW AND HOW THINGS ARE GOING WITH HIMSELF OR HIS FELLOW SAILORS
MOST TRUE HE SAID
IF THEN THE RULER CATCHES ANYBODY BESIDE HIMSELF LYING IN THE STATE
'ANY OF THE CRAFTSMEN WHETHER HE BE PRIEST OR PHYSICIAN OR CARPENTER
HE WILL PUNISH HIM FOR INTRODUCING A PRACTICE WHICH IS EQUALLY
SUBVERSIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE OF SHIP OR STATE
MOST CERTAINLY HE SAID IF OUR IDEA OF THE STATE IS EVER CARRIED OUT
IN THE NEXT PLACE OUR YOUTH MUST BE TEMPERATE
CERTAINLY
ARE NOT THE CHIEF ELEMENTS OF TEMPERANCE SPEAKING GENERALLY OBEDIENCE
TO COMMANDERS AND SELF CONTROL IN SENSUAL PLEASURES
TRUE
THEN WE SHALL APPROVE SUCH LANGUAGE AS THAT OF DIOMEDE IN HOMER
'FRIEND SIT STILL AND OBEY MY WORD
AND THE VERSES WHICH FOLLOW
'THE GREEKS MARCHED BREATHING PROWESS IN SILENT AWE OF THEIR
LEADERS
AND OTHER SENTIMENTS OF THE SAME KIND
WE SHALL
WHAT OF THIS LINE
'O HEAVY WITH WINE WHO HAST THE EYES OF A DOG AND THE HEART OF A STAG
AND OF THE WORDS WHICH FOLLOW WOULD YOU SAY THAT THESE OR ANY SIMILAR
IMPERTINENCES WHICH PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS ARE SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS TO THEIR
RULERS WHETHER IN VERSE OR PROSE ARE WELL OR ILL SPOKEN
THEY ARE ILL SPOKEN
THEY MAY VERY POSSIBLY AFFORD SOME AMUSEMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONDUCE
TO TEMPERANCE
AND THEREFORE THEY ARE LIKELY TO DO HARM TO OUR YOUNG
MEN YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME THERE
YES
AND THEN AGAIN TO MAKE THE WISEST OF MEN SAY THAT NOTHING IN HIS
OPINION IS MORE GLORIOUS THAN
'WHEN THE TABLES ARE FULL OF BREAD AND MEAT AND THE CUP BEARER CARRIES
ROUND WINE WHICH HE DRAWS FROM THE BOWL AND POURS INTO THE CUPS
IS IT FIT OR CONDUCIVE TO TEMPERANCE FOR A YOUNG MAN TO HEAR SUCH WORDS
OR THE VERSE
'THE SADDEST OF FATES IS TO DIE AND MEET DESTINY FROM HUNGER
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY AGAIN TO THE TALE OF ZEUS WHO WHILE OTHER GODS AND
MEN WERE ASLEEP AND HE THE ONLY PERSON AWAKE LAY DEVISING PLANS BUT
FORGOT THEM ALL IN A MOMENT THROUGH HIS LUST AND WAS SO COMPLETELY
OVERCOME AT THE SIGHT OF HERE THAT HE WOULD NOT EVEN GO INTO THE HUT
BUT WANTED TO LIE WITH HER ON THE GROUND DECLARING THAT HE HAD NEVER
BEEN IN SUCH A STATE OF RAPTURE BEFORE EVEN WHEN THEY FIRST MET ONE
ANOTHER
'WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PARENTS
OR THAT OTHER TALE OF HOW HEPHAESTUS BECAUSE OF SIMILAR GOINGS ON CAST
A CHAIN AROUND ARES AND APHRODITE
INDEED HE SAID I AM STRONGLY OF OPINION THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO HEAR
THAT SORT OF THING
BUT ANY DEEDS OF ENDURANCE WHICH ARE DONE OR TOLD BY FAMOUS MEN THESE
THEY OUGHT TO SEE AND HEAR AS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS SAID IN THE VERSES
'HE SMOTE HIS BREAST AND THUS REPROACHED HIS HEART ENDURE MY HEART
FAR WORSE HAST THOU ENDURED
CERTAINLY HE SAID
IN THE NEXT PLACE WE MUST NOT LET THEM BE RECEIVERS OF GIFTS OR LOVERS
OF MONEY
CERTAINLY NOT
NEITHER MUST WE SING TO THEM OF
'GIFTS PERSUADING GODS AND PERSUADING REVEREND KINGS
NEITHER IS PHOENIX THE TUTOR OF ACHILLES TO BE APPROVED OR DEEMED TO
HAVE GIVEN HIS PUPIL GOOD COUNSEL WHEN HE TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD TAKE
THE GIFTS OF THE GREEKS AND ASSIST THEM BUT THAT WITHOUT A GIFT HE
SHOULD NOT LAY ASIDE HIS ANGER
NEITHER WILL WE BELIEVE OR ACKNOWLEDGE
ACHILLES HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN SUCH A LOVER OF MONEY THAT HE TOOK
AGAMEMNON'S GIFTS OR THAT WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED PAYMENT HE RESTORED THE
DEAD BODY OF HECTOR BUT THAT WITHOUT PAYMENT HE WAS UNWILLING TO DO SO
UNDOUBTEDLY HE SAID THESE ARE NOT SENTIMENTS WHICH CAN BE APPROVED
LOVING HOMER AS I DO I HARDLY LIKE TO SAY THAT IN ATTRIBUTING THESE
FEELINGS TO ACHILLES OR IN BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE TRULY ATTRIBUTED
TO HIM HE IS GUILTY OF DOWNRIGHT IMPIETY
AS LITTLE CAN I BELIEVE THE
NARRATIVE OF HIS INSOLENCE TO APOLLO WHERE HE SAYS
'THOU HAST WRONGED ME O FAR DARTER MOST ABOMINABLE OF DEITIES
VERILY
I WOULD BE EVEN WITH THEE IF I HAD ONLY THE POWER
OR HIS INSUBORDINATION TO THE RIVER GOD ON WHOSE DIVINITY HE IS READY
TO LAY HANDS OR HIS OFFERING TO THE DEAD PATROCLUS OF HIS OWN HAIR
WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEDICATED TO THE OTHER RIVER GOD SPERCHEIUS
AND THAT HE ACTUALLY PERFORMED THIS VOW OR THAT HE DRAGGED HECTOR ROUND
THE TOMB OF PATROCLUS AND SLAUGHTERED THE CAPTIVES AT THE PYRE OF ALL
THIS I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GUILTY ANY MORE THAN I CAN ALLOW
OUR CITIZENS TO BELIEVE THAT HE THE WISE CHEIRON'S PUPIL THE SON OF A
GODDESS AND OF PELEUS WHO WAS THE GENTLEST OF MEN AND THIRD IN DESCENT
FROM ZEUS WAS SO DISORDERED IN HIS WITS AS TO BE AT ONE TIME THE SLAVE
OF TWO SEEMINGLY INCONSISTENT PASSIONS MEANNESS NOT UNTAINTED BY
AVARICE COMBINED WITH OVERWEENING CONTEMPT OF GODS AND MEN
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT HE REPLIED
AND LET US EQUALLY REFUSE TO BELIEVE OR ALLOW TO BE REPEATED THE TALE
OF THESEUS SON OF POSEIDON OR OF PEIRITHOUS SON OF ZEUS GOING FORTH AS
THEY DID TO PERPETRATE A HORRID RAPE OR OF ANY OTHER HERO OR SON OF
A GOD DARING TO DO SUCH IMPIOUS AND DREADFUL THINGS AS THEY FALSELY
ASCRIBE TO THEM IN OUR DAY AND LET US FURTHER COMPEL THE POETS TO
DECLARE EITHER THAT THESE ACTS WERE NOT DONE BY THEM OR THAT THEY
WERE NOT THE SONS OF GODS BOTH IN THE SAME BREATH THEY SHALL NOT BE
PERMITTED TO AFFIRM
WE WILL NOT HAVE THEM TRYING TO PERSUADE OUR YOUTH
THAT THE GODS ARE THE AUTHORS OF EVIL AND THAT HEROES ARE NO BETTER
THAN MEN SENTIMENTS WHICH AS WE WERE SAYING ARE NEITHER PIOUS NOR
TRUE FOR WE HAVE ALREADY PROVED THAT EVIL CANNOT COME FROM THE GODS
ASSUREDLY NOT
AND FURTHER THEY ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A BAD EFFECT ON THOSE WHO HEAR THEM
FOR EVERYBODY WILL BEGIN TO EXCUSE HIS OWN VICES WHEN HE IS CONVINCED
THAT SIMILAR WICKEDNESSES ARE ALWAYS BEING PERPETRATED BY
'THE KINDRED OF THE GODS THE RELATIVES OF ZEUS WHOSE ANCESTRAL ALTAR
THE ALTAR OF ZEUS IS ALOFT IN AIR ON THE PEAK OF IDA
AND WHO HAVE
'THE BLOOD OF DEITIES YET FLOWING IN THEIR VEINS
AND THEREFORE LET US PUT AN END TO SUCH TALES LEST THEY ENGENDER LAXITY
OF MORALS AMONG THE YOUNG
BY ALL MEANS HE REPLIED
BUT NOW THAT WE ARE DETERMINING WHAT CLASSES OF SUBJECTS ARE OR ARE NOT
TO BE SPOKEN OF LET US SEE WHETHER ANY HAVE BEEN OMITTED BY US
THE
MANNER IN WHICH GODS AND DEMIGODS AND HEROES AND THE WORLD BELOW SHOULD
BE TREATED HAS BEEN ALREADY LAID DOWN
VERY TRUE
AND WHAT SHALL WE SAY ABOUT MEN THAT IS CLEARLY THE REMAINING PORTION
OF OUR SUBJECT
CLEARLY SO
BUT WE ARE NOT IN A CONDITION TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION AT PRESENT MY
FRIEND
WHY NOT
BECAUSE IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN WE SHALL HAVE TO SAY THAT ABOUT MEN POETS
AND STORY TELLERS ARE GUILTY OF MAKING THE GRAVEST MISSTATEMENTS WHEN
THEY TELL US THAT WICKED MEN ARE OFTEN HAPPY AND THE GOOD MISERABLE
AND THAT INJUSTICE IS PROFITABLE WHEN UNDETECTED BUT THAT JUSTICE IS A
MAN'S OWN LOSS AND ANOTHER'S GAIN THESE THINGS WE SHALL FORBID THEM TO
UTTER AND COMMAND THEM TO SING AND SAY THE OPPOSITE
TO BE SURE WE SHALL HE REPLIED
BUT IF YOU ADMIT THAT I AM RIGHT IN THIS THEN I SHALL MAINTAIN THAT YOU
HAVE IMPLIED THE PRINCIPLE FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG CONTENDING
I GRANT THE TRUTH OF YOUR INFERENCE
THAT SUCH THINGS ARE OR ARE NOT TO BE SAID ABOUT MEN IS A QUESTION WHICH
WE CANNOT DETERMINE UNTIL WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT JUSTICE IS AND HOW
NATURALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POSSESSOR WHETHER HE SEEM TO BE JUST OR
NOT
MOST TRUE HE SAID
ENOUGH OF THE SUBJECTS OF POETRY LET US NOW SPEAK OF THE STYLE AND
WHEN THIS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BOTH MATTER AND MANNER WILL HAVE BEEN
COMPLETELY TREATED
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN SAID ADEIMANTUS
THEN I MUST MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND AND PERHAPS I MAY BE MORE INTELLIGIBLE
IF I PUT THE MATTER IN THIS WAY
YOU ARE AWARE I SUPPOSE THAT ALL
MYTHOLOGY AND POETRY IS A NARRATION OF EVENTS EITHER PAST PRESENT OR
TO COME
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
AND NARRATION MAY BE EITHER SIMPLE NARRATION OR IMITATION OR A UNION
OF THE TWO
THAT AGAIN HE SAID I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND
I FEAR THAT I MUST BE A RIDICULOUS TEACHER WHEN I HAVE SO MUCH
DIFFICULTY IN MAKING MYSELF APPREHENDED
LIKE A BAD SPEAKER THEREFORE
I WILL NOT TAKE THE WHOLE OF THE SUBJECT BUT WILL BREAK A PIECE OFF IN
ILLUSTRATION OF MY MEANING
YOU KNOW THE FIRST LINES OF THE ILIAD
IN WHICH THE POET SAYS THAT CHRYSES PRAYED AGAMEMNON TO RELEASE HIS
DAUGHTER AND THAT AGAMEMNON FLEW INTO A PASSION WITH HIM WHEREUPON
CHRYSES FAILING OF HIS OBJECT INVOKED THE ANGER OF THE GOD AGAINST THE
ACHAEANS
NOW AS FAR AS THESE LINES
'AND HE PRAYED ALL THE GREEKS BUT ESPECIALLY THE TWO SONS OF ATREUS
THE CHIEFS OF THE PEOPLE
THE POET IS SPEAKING IN HIS OWN PERSON HE NEVER LEADS US TO SUPPOSE
THAT HE IS ANY ONE ELSE
BUT IN WHAT FOLLOWS HE TAKES THE PERSON OF
CHRYSES AND THEN HE DOES ALL THAT HE CAN TO MAKE US BELIEVE THAT THE
SPEAKER IS NOT HOMER BUT THE AGED PRIEST HIMSELF
AND IN THIS DOUBLE
FORM HE HAS CAST THE ENTIRE NARRATIVE OF THE EVENTS WHICH OCCURRED AT
TROY AND IN ITHACA AND THROUGHOUT THE ODYSSEY
YES
AND A NARRATIVE IT REMAINS BOTH IN THE SPEECHES WHICH THE POET RECITES
FROM TIME TO TIME AND IN THE INTERMEDIATE PASSAGES
QUITE TRUE
BUT WHEN THE POET SPEAKS IN THE PERSON OF ANOTHER MAY WE NOT SAY THAT
HE ASSIMILATES HIS STYLE TO THAT OF THE PERSON WHO AS HE INFORMS YOU
IS GOING TO SPEAK
CERTAINLY
AND THIS ASSIMILATION OF HIMSELF TO ANOTHER EITHER BY THE USE OF VOICE
OR GESTURE IS THE IMITATION OF THE PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER HE ASSUMES
OF COURSE
THEN IN THIS CASE THE NARRATIVE OF THE POET MAY BE SAID TO PROCEED BY
WAY OF IMITATION
VERY TRUE
OR IF THE POET EVERYWHERE APPEARS AND NEVER CONCEALS HIMSELF THEN
AGAIN THE IMITATION IS DROPPED AND HIS POETRY BECOMES SIMPLE NARRATION
HOWEVER IN ORDER THAT I MAY MAKE MY MEANING QUITE CLEAR AND THAT YOU
MAY NO MORE SAY 'I DON'T UNDERSTAND I WILL SHOW HOW THE CHANGE MIGHT
BE EFFECTED
IF HOMER HAD SAID 'THE PRIEST CAME HAVING HIS DAUGHTER'S
RANSOM IN HIS HANDS SUPPLICATING THE ACHAEANS AND ABOVE ALL THE
KINGS AND THEN IF INSTEAD OF SPEAKING IN THE PERSON OF CHRYSES
HE HAD CONTINUED IN HIS OWN PERSON THE WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT
IMITATION BUT SIMPLE NARRATION
THE PASSAGE WOULD HAVE RUN AS FOLLOWS
I AM NO POET AND THEREFORE I DROP THE METRE 'THE PRIEST CAME AND
PRAYED THE GODS ON BEHALF OF THE GREEKS THAT THEY MIGHT CAPTURE TROY
AND RETURN SAFELY HOME BUT BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD GIVE HIM BACK HIS
DAUGHTER AND TAKE THE RANSOM WHICH HE BROUGHT AND RESPECT THE GOD
THUS HE SPOKE AND THE OTHER GREEKS REVERED THE PRIEST AND ASSENTED
BUT
AGAMEMNON WAS WROTH AND BADE HIM DEPART AND NOT COME AGAIN LEST THE
STAFF AND CHAPLETS OF THE GOD SHOULD BE OF NO AVAIL TO HIM THE DAUGHTER
OF CHRYSES SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED HE SAID SHE SHOULD GROW OLD WITH HIM
IN ARGOS
AND THEN HE TOLD HIM TO GO AWAY AND NOT TO PROVOKE HIM IF HE
INTENDED TO GET HOME UNSCATHED
AND THE OLD MAN WENT AWAY IN FEAR AND
SILENCE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT THE CAMP HE CALLED UPON APOLLO BY HIS
MANY NAMES REMINDING HIM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HE HAD DONE PLEASING TO
HIM WHETHER IN BUILDING HIS TEMPLES OR IN OFFERING SACRIFICE AND
PRAYING THAT HIS GOOD DEEDS MIGHT BE RETURNED TO HIM AND THAT THE
ACHAEANS MIGHT EXPIATE HIS TEARS BY THE ARROWS OF THE GOD AND SO ON
IN THIS WAY THE WHOLE BECOMES SIMPLE NARRATIVE
I UNDERSTAND HE SAID
OR YOU MAY SUPPOSE THE OPPOSITE CASE THAT THE INTERMEDIATE PASSAGES ARE
OMITTED AND THE DIALOGUE ONLY LEFT
THAT ALSO HE SAID I UNDERSTAND YOU MEAN FOR EXAMPLE AS IN TRAGEDY
YOU HAVE CONCEIVED MY MEANING PERFECTLY AND IF I MISTAKE NOT WHAT YOU
FAILED TO APPREHEND BEFORE IS NOW MADE CLEAR TO YOU THAT POETRY AND
MYTHOLOGY ARE IN SOME CASES WHOLLY IMITATIVE INSTANCES OF THIS ARE
SUPPLIED BY TRAGEDY AND COMEDY THERE IS LIKEWISE THE OPPOSITE STYLE
IN WHICH THE POET IS THE ONLY SPEAKER OF THIS THE DITHYRAMB AFFORDS
THE BEST EXAMPLE AND THE COMBINATION OF BOTH IS FOUND IN EPIC AND IN
SEVERAL OTHER STYLES OF POETRY
DO I TAKE YOU WITH ME
YES HE SAID I SEE NOW WHAT YOU MEANT
I WILL ASK YOU TO REMEMBER ALSO WHAT I BEGAN BY SAYING THAT WE HAD DONE
WITH THE SUBJECT AND MIGHT PROCEED TO THE STYLE
YES I REMEMBER
IN SAYING THIS I INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT WE MUST COME TO AN
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE MIMETIC ART WHETHER THE POETS IN NARRATING
THEIR STORIES ARE TO BE ALLOWED BY US TO IMITATE AND IF SO WHETHER
IN WHOLE OR IN PART AND IF THE LATTER IN WHAT PARTS OR SHOULD ALL
IMITATION BE PROHIBITED
YOU MEAN I SUSPECT TO ASK WHETHER TRAGEDY AND COMEDY SHALL BE ADMITTED
INTO OUR STATE
YES I SAID BUT THERE MAY BE MORE THAN THIS IN QUESTION I REALLY DO
NOT KNOW AS YET BUT WHITHER THE ARGUMENT MAY BLOW THITHER WE GO
AND GO WE WILL HE SAID
THEN ADEIMANTUS LET ME ASK YOU WHETHER OUR GUARDIANS OUGHT TO BE
IMITATORS OR RATHER HAS NOT THIS QUESTION BEEN DECIDED BY THE RULE
ALREADY LAID DOWN THAT ONE MAN CAN ONLY DO ONE THING WELL AND NOT MANY
AND THAT IF HE ATTEMPT MANY HE WILL ALTOGETHER FAIL OF GAINING MUCH
REPUTATION IN ANY
CERTAINLY
AND THIS IS EQUALLY TRUE OF IMITATION NO ONE MAN CAN IMITATE MANY
THINGS AS WELL AS HE WOULD IMITATE A SINGLE ONE
HE CANNOT
THEN THE SAME PERSON WILL HARDLY BE ABLE TO PLAY A SERIOUS PART IN LIFE
AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE AN IMITATOR AND IMITATE MANY OTHER PARTS AS
WELL FOR EVEN WHEN TWO SPECIES OF IMITATION ARE NEARLY ALLIED THE SAME
PERSONS CANNOT SUCCEED IN BOTH AS FOR EXAMPLE THE WRITERS OF TRAGEDY
AND COMEDY DID YOU NOT JUST NOW CALL THEM IMITATIONS
YES I DID AND YOU ARE RIGHT IN THINKING THAT THE SAME PERSONS CANNOT
SUCCEED IN BOTH
ANY MORE THAN THEY CAN BE RHAPSODISTS AND ACTORS AT ONCE
TRUE
NEITHER ARE COMIC AND TRAGIC ACTORS THE SAME YET ALL THESE THINGS ARE
BUT IMITATIONS
THEY ARE SO
AND HUMAN NATURE ADEIMANTUS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN COINED INTO YET
SMALLER PIECES AND TO BE AS INCAPABLE OF IMITATING MANY THINGS WELL AS
OF PERFORMING WELL THE ACTIONS OF WHICH THE IMITATIONS ARE COPIES
QUITE TRUE HE REPLIED
IF THEN WE ADHERE TO OUR ORIGINAL NOTION AND BEAR IN MIND THAT
OUR GUARDIANS SETTING ASIDE EVERY OTHER BUSINESS ARE TO DEDICATE
THEMSELVES WHOLLY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF FREEDOM IN THE STATE MAKING
THIS THEIR CRAFT AND ENGAGING IN NO WORK WHICH DOES NOT BEAR ON THIS
END THEY OUGHT NOT TO PRACTISE OR IMITATE ANYTHING ELSE IF THEY
IMITATE AT ALL THEY SHOULD IMITATE FROM YOUTH UPWARD ONLY THOSE
CHARACTERS WHICH ARE SUITABLE TO THEIR PROFESSION THE COURAGEOUS
TEMPERATE HOLY FREE AND THE LIKE BUT THEY SHOULD NOT DEPICT OR BE
SKILFUL AT IMITATING ANY KIND OF ILLIBERALITY OR BASENESS LEST FROM
IMITATION THEY SHOULD COME TO BE WHAT THEY IMITATE
DID YOU NEVER
OBSERVE HOW IMITATIONS BEGINNING IN EARLY YOUTH AND CONTINUING FAR INTO
LIFE AT LENGTH GROW INTO HABITS AND BECOME A SECOND NATURE AFFECTING
BODY VOICE AND MIND
YES CERTAINLY HE SAID
THEN I SAID WE WILL NOT ALLOW THOSE FOR WHOM WE PROFESS A CARE AND OF
WHOM WE SAY THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE GOOD MEN TO IMITATE A WOMAN WHETHER
YOUNG OR OLD QUARRELLING WITH HER HUSBAND OR STRIVING AND VAUNTING
AGAINST THE GODS IN CONCEIT OF HER HAPPINESS OR WHEN SHE IS IN
AFFLICTION OR SORROW OR WEEPING AND CERTAINLY NOT ONE WHO IS IN
SICKNESS LOVE OR LABOUR
VERY RIGHT HE SAID
NEITHER MUST THEY REPRESENT SLAVES MALE OR FEMALE PERFORMING THE
OFFICES OF SLAVES
THEY MUST NOT
AND SURELY NOT BAD MEN WHETHER COWARDS OR ANY OTHERS WHO DO THE
REVERSE OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST BEEN PRESCRIBING WHO SCOLD OR MOCK OR
REVILE ONE ANOTHER IN DRINK OR OUT OF DRINK OR WHO IN ANY OTHER MANNER
SIN AGAINST THEMSELVES AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS IN WORD OR DEED AS THE
MANNER OF SUCH IS
NEITHER SHOULD THEY BE TRAINED TO IMITATE THE ACTION
OR SPEECH OF MEN OR WOMEN WHO ARE MAD OR BAD FOR MADNESS LIKE VICE IS
TO BE KNOWN BUT NOT TO BE PRACTISED OR IMITATED
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
NEITHER MAY THEY IMITATE SMITHS OR OTHER ARTIFICERS OR OARSMEN OR
BOATSWAINS OR THE LIKE
HOW CAN THEY HE SAID WHEN THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO APPLY THEIR MINDS TO
THE CALLINGS OF ANY OF THESE
NOR MAY THEY IMITATE THE NEIGHING OF HORSES THE BELLOWING OF BULLS THE
MURMUR OF RIVERS AND ROLL OF THE OCEAN THUNDER AND ALL THAT SORT OF
THING
NAY HE SAID IF MADNESS BE FORBIDDEN NEITHER MAY THEY COPY THE
BEHAVIOUR OF MADMEN
YOU MEAN I SAID IF I UNDERSTAND YOU ARIGHT THAT THERE IS ONE SORT OF
NARRATIVE STYLE WHICH MAY BE EMPLOYED BY A TRULY GOOD MAN WHEN HE HAS
ANYTHING TO SAY AND THAT ANOTHER SORT WILL BE USED BY A MAN OF AN
OPPOSITE CHARACTER AND EDUCATION
AND WHICH ARE THESE TWO SORTS HE ASKED
SUPPOSE I ANSWERED THAT A JUST AND GOOD MAN IN THE COURSE OF A
NARRATION COMES ON SOME SAYING OR ACTION OF ANOTHER GOOD MAN I SHOULD
IMAGINE THAT HE WILL LIKE TO PERSONATE HIM AND WILL NOT BE ASHAMED OF
THIS SORT OF IMITATION HE WILL BE MOST READY TO PLAY THE PART OF THE
GOOD MAN WHEN HE IS ACTING FIRMLY AND WISELY IN A LESS DEGREE WHEN
HE IS OVERTAKEN BY ILLNESS OR LOVE OR DRINK OR HAS MET WITH ANY OTHER
DISASTER
BUT WHEN HE COMES TO A CHARACTER WHICH IS UNWORTHY OF HIM HE
WILL NOT MAKE A STUDY OF THAT HE WILL DISDAIN SUCH A PERSON AND WILL
ASSUME HIS LIKENESS IF AT ALL FOR A MOMENT ONLY WHEN HE IS PERFORMING
SOME GOOD ACTION AT OTHER TIMES HE WILL BE ASHAMED TO PLAY A PART WHICH
HE HAS NEVER PRACTISED NOR WILL HE LIKE TO FASHION AND FRAME HIMSELF
AFTER THE BASER MODELS HE FEELS THE EMPLOYMENT OF SUCH AN ART UNLESS
IN JEST TO BE BENEATH HIM AND HIS MIND REVOLTS AT IT
SO I SHOULD EXPECT HE REPLIED
THEN HE WILL ADOPT A MODE OF NARRATION SUCH AS WE HAVE ILLUSTRATED
OUT OF HOMER THAT IS TO SAY HIS STYLE WILL BE BOTH IMITATIVE AND
NARRATIVE BUT THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE OF THE FORMER AND A GREAT DEAL
OF THE LATTER
DO YOU AGREE
CERTAINLY HE SAID THAT IS THE MODEL WHICH SUCH A SPEAKER MUST
NECESSARILY TAKE
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SORT OF CHARACTER WHO WILL NARRATE ANYTHING AND
THE WORSE HE IS THE MORE UNSCRUPULOUS HE WILL BE NOTHING WILL BE TOO
BAD FOR HIM AND HE WILL BE READY TO IMITATE ANYTHING NOT AS A JOKE
BUT IN RIGHT GOOD EARNEST AND BEFORE A LARGE COMPANY
AS I WAS JUST NOW
SAYING HE WILL ATTEMPT TO REPRESENT THE ROLL OF THUNDER THE NOISE OF
WIND AND HAIL OR THE CREAKING OF WHEELS AND PULLEYS AND THE VARIOUS
SOUNDS OF FLUTES PIPES TRUMPETS AND ALL SORTS OF INSTRUMENTS HE WILL
BARK LIKE A DOG BLEAT LIKE A SHEEP OR CROW LIKE A COCK HIS ENTIRE ART
WILL CONSIST IN IMITATION OF VOICE AND GESTURE AND THERE WILL BE VERY
LITTLE NARRATION
THAT HE SAID WILL BE HIS MODE OF SPEAKING
THESE THEN ARE THE TWO KINDS OF STYLE
YES
AND YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN SAYING THAT ONE OF THEM IS SIMPLE AND HAS
BUT SLIGHT CHANGES AND IF THE HARMONY AND RHYTHM ARE ALSO CHOSEN
FOR THEIR SIMPLICITY THE RESULT IS THAT THE SPEAKER IF HE SPEAKS
CORRECTLY IS ALWAYS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME IN STYLE AND HE WILL KEEP
WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A SINGLE HARMONY FOR THE CHANGES ARE NOT GREAT
AND IN LIKE MANNER HE WILL MAKE USE OF NEARLY THE SAME RHYTHM
THAT IS QUITE TRUE HE SAID
WHEREAS THE OTHER REQUIRES ALL SORTS OF HARMONIES AND ALL SORTS OF
RHYTHMS IF THE MUSIC AND THE STYLE ARE TO CORRESPOND BECAUSE THE STYLE
HAS ALL SORTS OF CHANGES
THAT IS ALSO PERFECTLY TRUE HE REPLIED
AND DO NOT THE TWO STYLES OR THE MIXTURE OF THE TWO COMPREHEND ALL
POETRY AND EVERY FORM OF EXPRESSION IN WORDS NO ONE CAN SAY ANYTHING
EXCEPT IN ONE OR OTHER OF THEM OR IN BOTH TOGETHER
THEY INCLUDE ALL HE SAID
AND SHALL WE RECEIVE INTO OUR STATE ALL THE THREE STYLES OR ONE ONLY OF
THE TWO UNMIXED STYLES OR WOULD YOU INCLUDE THE MIXED
I SHOULD PREFER ONLY TO ADMIT THE PURE IMITATOR OF VIRTUE
YES I SAID ADEIMANTUS BUT THE MIXED STYLE IS ALSO VERY CHARMING AND
INDEED THE PANTOMIMIC WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE ONE CHOSEN BY YOU
IS THE MOST POPULAR STYLE WITH CHILDREN AND THEIR ATTENDANTS AND WITH
THE WORLD IN GENERAL
I DO NOT DENY IT
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT SUCH A STYLE IS UNSUITABLE TO OUR
STATE IN WHICH HUMAN NATURE IS NOT TWOFOLD OR MANIFOLD FOR ONE MAN
PLAYS ONE PART ONLY
YES QUITE UNSUITABLE
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY IN OUR STATE AND IN OUR STATE ONLY WE
SHALL FIND A SHOEMAKER TO BE A SHOEMAKER AND NOT A PILOT ALSO AND A
HUSBANDMAN TO BE A HUSBANDMAN AND NOT A DICAST ALSO AND A SOLDIER A
SOLDIER AND NOT A TRADER ALSO AND THE SAME THROUGHOUT
TRUE HE SAID
AND THEREFORE WHEN ANY ONE OF THESE PANTOMIMIC GENTLEMEN WHO ARE SO
CLEVER THAT THEY CAN IMITATE ANYTHING COMES TO US AND MAKES A PROPOSAL
TO EXHIBIT HIMSELF AND HIS POETRY WE WILL FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP HIM AS
A SWEET AND HOLY AND WONDERFUL BEING BUT WE MUST ALSO INFORM HIM THAT
IN OUR STATE SUCH AS HE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO EXIST THE LAW WILL NOT
ALLOW THEM
AND SO WHEN WE HAVE ANOINTED HIM WITH MYRRH AND SET A
GARLAND OF WOOL UPON HIS HEAD WE SHALL SEND HIM AWAY TO ANOTHER CITY
FOR WE MEAN TO EMPLOY FOR OUR SOULS' HEALTH THE ROUGHER AND SEVERER POET
OR STORY TELLER WHO WILL IMITATE THE STYLE OF THE VIRTUOUS ONLY AND
WILL FOLLOW THOSE MODELS WHICH WE PRESCRIBED AT FIRST WHEN WE BEGAN THE
EDUCATION OF OUR SOLDIERS
WE CERTAINLY WILL HE SAID IF WE HAVE THE POWER
THEN NOW MY FRIEND I SAID THAT PART OF MUSIC OR LITERARY EDUCATION
WHICH RELATES TO THE STORY OR MYTH MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE FINISHED FOR
THE MATTER AND MANNER HAVE BOTH BEEN DISCUSSED
I THINK SO TOO HE SAID
NEXT IN ORDER WILL FOLLOW MELODY AND SONG
THAT IS OBVIOUS
EVERY ONE CAN SEE ALREADY WHAT WE OUGHT TO SAY ABOUT THEM IF WE ARE TO
BE CONSISTENT WITH OURSELVES
I FEAR SAID GLAUCON LAUGHING THAT THE WORD 'EVERY ONE' HARDLY
INCLUDES ME FOR I CANNOT AT THE MOMENT SAY WHAT THEY SHOULD BE THOUGH
I MAY GUESS
AT ANY RATE YOU CAN TELL THAT A SONG OR ODE HAS THREE PARTS THE WORDS
THE MELODY AND THE RHYTHM THAT DEGREE OF KNOWLEDGE I MAY PRESUPPOSE
YES HE SAID SO MUCH AS THAT YOU MAY
AND AS FOR THE WORDS THERE WILL SURELY BE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WORDS
WHICH ARE AND WHICH ARE NOT SET TO MUSIC BOTH WILL CONFORM TO THE SAME
LAWS AND THESE HAVE BEEN ALREADY DETERMINED BY US
YES
AND THE MELODY AND RHYTHM WILL DEPEND UPON THE WORDS
CERTAINLY
WE WERE SAYING WHEN WE SPOKE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER THAT WE HAD NO NEED
OF LAMENTATION AND STRAINS OF SORROW
TRUE
AND WHICH ARE THE HARMONIES EXPRESSIVE OF SORROW YOU ARE MUSICAL AND
CAN TELL ME
THE HARMONIES WHICH YOU MEAN ARE THE MIXED OR TENOR LYDIAN AND THE
FULL TONED OR BASS LYDIAN AND SUCH LIKE
THESE THEN I SAID MUST BE BANISHED EVEN TO WOMEN WHO HAVE A CHARACTER
TO MAINTAIN THEY ARE OF NO USE AND MUCH LESS TO MEN
CERTAINLY
IN THE NEXT PLACE DRUNKENNESS AND SOFTNESS AND INDOLENCE ARE UTTERLY
UNBECOMING THE CHARACTER OF OUR GUARDIANS
UTTERLY UNBECOMING
AND WHICH ARE THE SOFT OR DRINKING HARMONIES
THE IONIAN HE REPLIED AND THE LYDIAN THEY ARE TERMED 'RELAXED
WELL AND ARE THESE OF ANY MILITARY USE
QUITE THE REVERSE HE REPLIED AND IF SO THE DORIAN AND THE PHRYGIAN ARE
THE ONLY ONES WHICH YOU HAVE LEFT
I ANSWERED OF THE HARMONIES I KNOW NOTHING BUT I WANT TO HAVE ONE
WARLIKE TO SOUND THE NOTE OR ACCENT WHICH A BRAVE MAN UTTERS IN THE
HOUR OF DANGER AND STERN RESOLVE OR WHEN HIS CAUSE IS FAILING AND HE
IS GOING TO WOUNDS OR DEATH OR IS OVERTAKEN BY SOME OTHER EVIL AND
AT EVERY SUCH CRISIS MEETS THE BLOWS OF FORTUNE WITH FIRM STEP AND A
DETERMINATION TO ENDURE AND ANOTHER TO BE USED BY HIM IN TIMES OF PEACE
AND FREEDOM OF ACTION WHEN THERE IS NO PRESSURE OF NECESSITY AND HE IS
SEEKING TO PERSUADE GOD BY PRAYER OR MAN BY INSTRUCTION AND ADMONITION
OR ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN HE IS EXPRESSING HIS WILLINGNESS TO YIELD TO
PERSUASION OR ENTREATY OR ADMONITION AND WHICH REPRESENTS HIM WHEN
BY PRUDENT CONDUCT HE HAS ATTAINED HIS END NOT CARRIED AWAY BY HIS
SUCCESS BUT ACTING MODERATELY AND WISELY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND
ACQUIESCING IN THE EVENT
THESE TWO HARMONIES I ASK YOU TO LEAVE
THE STRAIN OF NECESSITY AND THE STRAIN OF FREEDOM THE STRAIN OF THE
UNFORTUNATE AND THE STRAIN OF THE FORTUNATE THE STRAIN OF COURAGE AND
THE STRAIN OF TEMPERANCE THESE I SAY LEAVE
AND THESE HE REPLIED ARE THE DORIAN AND PHRYGIAN HARMONIES OF WHICH I
WAS JUST NOW SPEAKING
THEN I SAID IF THESE AND THESE ONLY ARE TO BE USED IN OUR SONGS AND
MELODIES WE SHALL NOT WANT MULTIPLICITY OF NOTES OR A PANHARMONIC
SCALE
I SUPPOSE NOT
THEN WE SHALL NOT MAINTAIN THE ARTIFICERS OF LYRES WITH THREE
CORNERS AND COMPLEX SCALES OR THE MAKERS OF ANY OTHER MANY STRINGED
CURIOUSLY HARMONISED INSTRUMENTS
CERTAINLY NOT
BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY TO FLUTE MAKERS AND FLUTE PLAYERS WOULD YOU ADMIT
THEM INTO OUR STATE WHEN YOU REFLECT THAT IN THIS COMPOSITE USE OF
HARMONY THE FLUTE IS WORSE THAN ALL THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS PUT
TOGETHER EVEN THE PANHARMONIC MUSIC IS ONLY AN IMITATION OF THE FLUTE
CLEARLY NOT
THERE REMAIN THEN ONLY THE LYRE AND THE HARP FOR USE IN THE CITY AND
THE SHEPHERDS MAY HAVE A PIPE IN THE COUNTRY
THAT IS SURELY THE CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN FROM THE ARGUMENT
THE PREFERRING OF APOLLO AND HIS INSTRUMENTS TO MARSYAS AND HIS
INSTRUMENTS IS NOT AT ALL STRANGE I SAID
NOT AT ALL HE REPLIED
AND SO BY THE DOG OF EGYPT WE HAVE BEEN UNCONSCIOUSLY PURGING THE
STATE WHICH NOT LONG AGO WE TERMED LUXURIOUS
AND WE HAVE DONE WISELY HE REPLIED
THEN LET US NOW FINISH THE PURGATION I SAID
NEXT IN ORDER TO
HARMONIES RHYTHMS WILL NATURALLY FOLLOW AND THEY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO
THE SAME RULES FOR WE OUGHT NOT TO SEEK OUT COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF METRE
OR METRES OF EVERY KIND BUT RATHER TO DISCOVER WHAT RHYTHMS ARE THE
EXPRESSIONS OF A COURAGEOUS AND HARMONIOUS LIFE AND WHEN WE HAVE FOUND
THEM WE SHALL ADAPT THE FOOT AND THE MELODY TO WORDS HAVING A LIKE
SPIRIT NOT THE WORDS TO THE FOOT AND MELODY
TO SAY WHAT THESE RHYTHMS
ARE WILL BE YOUR DUTY YOU MUST TEACH ME THEM AS YOU HAVE ALREADY
TAUGHT ME THE HARMONIES
BUT INDEED HE REPLIED I CANNOT TELL YOU
I ONLY KNOW THAT THERE
ARE SOME THREE PRINCIPLES OF RHYTHM OUT OF WHICH METRICAL SYSTEMS ARE
FRAMED JUST AS IN SOUNDS THERE ARE FOUR NOTES I E
THE FOUR NOTES OF
THE TETRACHORD OUT OF WHICH ALL THE HARMONIES ARE COMPOSED THAT IS
AN OBSERVATION WHICH I HAVE MADE
BUT OF WHAT SORT OF LIVES THEY ARE
SEVERALLY THE IMITATIONS I AM UNABLE TO SAY
THEN I SAID WE MUST TAKE DAMON INTO OUR COUNSELS AND HE WILL TELL US
WHAT RHYTHMS ARE EXPRESSIVE OF MEANNESS OR INSOLENCE OR FURY OR OTHER
UNWORTHINESS AND WHAT ARE TO BE RESERVED FOR THE EXPRESSION OF OPPOSITE
FEELINGS
AND I THINK THAT I HAVE AN INDISTINCT RECOLLECTION OF HIS
MENTIONING A COMPLEX CRETIC RHYTHM ALSO A DACTYLIC OR HEROIC AND HE
ARRANGED THEM IN SOME MANNER WHICH I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND MAKING
THE RHYTHMS EQUAL IN THE RISE AND FALL OF THE FOOT LONG AND SHORT
ALTERNATING AND UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN HE SPOKE OF AN IAMBIC AS WELL
AS OF A TROCHAIC RHYTHM AND ASSIGNED TO THEM SHORT AND LONG QUANTITIES
ALSO IN SOME CASES HE APPEARED TO PRAISE OR CENSURE THE MOVEMENT OF THE
FOOT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE RHYTHM OR PERHAPS A COMBINATION OF THE TWO
FOR I AM NOT CERTAIN WHAT HE MEANT
THESE MATTERS HOWEVER AS I WAS
SAYING HAD BETTER BE REFERRED TO DAMON HIMSELF FOR THE ANALYSIS OF
THE SUBJECT WOULD BE DIFFICULT YOU KNOW SOCRATES EXPRESSES HIMSELF
CARELESSLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS ASSUMED IGNORANCE OF THE DETAILS OF
THE SUBJECT
IN THE FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE HE APPEARS TO BE SPEAKING
OF PAEONIC RHYTHMS WHICH ARE IN THE RATIO OF 3 2 IN THE SECOND PART OF
DACTYLIC AND ANAPAESTIC RHYTHMS WHICH ARE IN THE RATIO OF 1 1 IN THE
LAST CLAUSE OF IAMBIC AND TROCHAIC RHYTHMS WHICH ARE IN THE RATIO OF
1 2 OR 2 1
RATHER SO I SHOULD SAY
BUT THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN SEEING THAT GRACE OR THE ABSENCE OF GRACE
IS AN EFFECT OF GOOD OR BAD RHYTHM
NONE AT ALL
AND ALSO THAT GOOD AND BAD RHYTHM NATURALLY ASSIMILATE TO A GOOD AND BAD
STYLE AND THAT HARMONY AND DISCORD IN LIKE MANNER FOLLOW STYLE FOR OUR
PRINCIPLE IS THAT RHYTHM AND HARMONY ARE REGULATED BY THE WORDS AND NOT
THE WORDS BY THEM
JUST SO HE SAID THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE WORDS
AND WILL NOT THE WORDS AND THE CHARACTER OF THE STYLE DEPEND ON THE
TEMPER OF THE SOUL
YES
AND EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE STYLE
YES
THEN BEAUTY OF STYLE AND HARMONY AND GRACE AND GOOD RHYTHM DEPEND ON
SIMPLICITY I MEAN THE TRUE SIMPLICITY OF A RIGHTLY AND NOBLY ORDERED
MIND AND CHARACTER NOT THAT OTHER SIMPLICITY WHICH IS ONLY AN EUPHEMISM
FOR FOLLY
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
AND IF OUR YOUTH ARE TO DO THEIR WORK IN LIFE MUST THEY NOT MAKE THESE
GRACES AND HARMONIES THEIR PERPETUAL AIM
THEY MUST
AND SURELY THE ART OF THE PAINTER AND EVERY OTHER CREATIVE AND
CONSTRUCTIVE ART ARE FULL OF THEM WEAVING EMBROIDERY ARCHITECTURE
AND EVERY KIND OF MANUFACTURE ALSO NATURE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE IN
ALL OF THEM THERE IS GRACE OR THE ABSENCE OF GRACE
AND UGLINESS AND
DISCORD AND INHARMONIOUS MOTION ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO ILL WORDS AND ILL
NATURE AS GRACE AND HARMONY ARE THE TWIN SISTERS OF GOODNESS AND VIRTUE
AND BEAR THEIR LIKENESS
THAT IS QUITE TRUE HE SAID
BUT SHALL OUR SUPERINTENDENCE GO NO FURTHER AND ARE THE POETS ONLY TO
BE REQUIRED BY US TO EXPRESS THE IMAGE OF THE GOOD IN THEIR WORKS ON
PAIN IF THEY DO ANYTHING ELSE OF EXPULSION FROM OUR STATE OR IS THE
SAME CONTROL TO BE EXTENDED TO OTHER ARTISTS AND ARE THEY ALSO TO BE
PROHIBITED FROM EXHIBITING THE OPPOSITE FORMS OF VICE AND INTEMPERANCE
AND MEANNESS AND INDECENCY IN SCULPTURE AND BUILDING AND THE OTHER
CREATIVE ARTS AND IS HE WHO CANNOT CONFORM TO THIS RULE OF OURS TO BE
PREVENTED FROM PRACTISING HIS ART IN OUR STATE LEST THE TASTE OF OUR
CITIZENS BE CORRUPTED BY HIM WE WOULD NOT HAVE OUR GUARDIANS GROW UP
AMID IMAGES OF MORAL DEFORMITY AS IN SOME NOXIOUS PASTURE AND THERE
BROWSE AND FEED UPON MANY A BANEFUL HERB AND FLOWER DAY BY DAY LITTLE
BY LITTLE UNTIL THEY SILENTLY GATHER A FESTERING MASS OF CORRUPTION
IN THEIR OWN SOUL
LET OUR ARTISTS RATHER BE THOSE WHO ARE GIFTED TO
DISCERN THE TRUE NATURE OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND GRACEFUL THEN WILL OUR
YOUTH DWELL IN A LAND OF HEALTH AMID FAIR SIGHTS AND SOUNDS AND
RECEIVE THE GOOD IN EVERYTHING AND BEAUTY THE EFFLUENCE OF FAIR WORKS
SHALL FLOW INTO THE EYE AND EAR LIKE A HEALTH GIVING BREEZE FROM A
PURER REGION AND INSENSIBLY DRAW THE SOUL FROM EARLIEST YEARS INTO
LIKENESS AND SYMPATHY WITH THE BEAUTY OF REASON
THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER TRAINING THAN THAT HE REPLIED
AND THEREFORE I SAID GLAUCON MUSICAL TRAINING IS A MORE POTENT
INSTRUMENT THAN ANY OTHER BECAUSE RHYTHM AND HARMONY FIND THEIR WAY
INTO THE INWARD PLACES OF THE SOUL ON WHICH THEY MIGHTILY FASTEN
IMPARTING GRACE AND MAKING THE SOUL OF HIM WHO IS RIGHTLY EDUCATED
GRACEFUL OR OF HIM WHO IS ILL EDUCATED UNGRACEFUL AND ALSO BECAUSE
HE WHO HAS RECEIVED THIS TRUE EDUCATION OF THE INNER BEING WILL MOST
SHREWDLY PERCEIVE OMISSIONS OR FAULTS IN ART AND NATURE AND WITH A TRUE
TASTE WHILE HE PRAISES AND REJOICES OVER AND RECEIVES INTO HIS SOUL THE
GOOD AND BECOMES NOBLE AND GOOD HE WILL JUSTLY BLAME AND HATE THE BAD
NOW IN THE DAYS OF HIS YOUTH EVEN BEFORE HE IS ABLE TO KNOW THE REASON
WHY AND WHEN REASON COMES HE WILL RECOGNISE AND SALUTE THE FRIEND WITH
WHOM HIS EDUCATION HAS MADE HIM LONG FAMILIAR
YES HE SAID I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU IN THINKING THAT OUR YOUTH SHOULD
BE TRAINED IN MUSIC AND ON THE GROUNDS WHICH YOU MENTION
JUST AS IN LEARNING TO READ I SAID WE WERE SATISFIED WHEN WE KNEW
THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET WHICH ARE VERY FEW IN ALL THEIR RECURRING
SIZES AND COMBINATIONS NOT SLIGHTING THEM AS UNIMPORTANT WHETHER THEY
OCCUPY A SPACE LARGE OR SMALL BUT EVERYWHERE EAGER TO MAKE THEM OUT
AND NOT THINKING OURSELVES PERFECT IN THE ART OF READING UNTIL WE
RECOGNISE THEM WHEREVER THEY ARE FOUND
TRUE
OR AS WE RECOGNISE THE REFLECTION OF LETTERS IN THE WATER OR IN A
MIRROR ONLY WHEN WE KNOW THE LETTERS THEMSELVES THE SAME ART AND STUDY
GIVING US THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH
EXACTLY
EVEN SO AS I MAINTAIN NEITHER WE NOR OUR GUARDIANS WHOM WE HAVE TO
EDUCATE CAN EVER BECOME MUSICAL UNTIL WE AND THEY KNOW THE ESSENTIAL
FORMS OF TEMPERANCE COURAGE LIBERALITY MAGNIFICENCE AND THEIR
KINDRED AS WELL AS THE CONTRARY FORMS IN ALL THEIR COMBINATIONS
AND CAN RECOGNISE THEM AND THEIR IMAGES WHEREVER THEY ARE FOUND NOT
SLIGHTING THEM EITHER IN SMALL THINGS OR GREAT BUT BELIEVING THEM ALL
TO BE WITHIN THE SPHERE OF ONE ART AND STUDY
MOST ASSUREDLY
AND WHEN A BEAUTIFUL SOUL HARMONIZES WITH A BEAUTIFUL FORM AND THE TWO
ARE CAST IN ONE MOULD THAT WILL BE THE FAIREST OF SIGHTS TO HIM WHO HAS
AN EYE TO SEE IT
THE FAIREST INDEED
AND THE FAIREST IS ALSO THE LOVELIEST
THAT MAY BE ASSUMED
AND THE MAN WHO HAS THE SPIRIT OF HARMONY WILL BE MOST IN LOVE WITH THE
LOVELIEST BUT HE WILL NOT LOVE HIM WHO IS OF AN INHARMONIOUS SOUL
THAT IS TRUE HE REPLIED IF THE DEFICIENCY BE IN HIS SOUL BUT IF THERE
BE ANY MERELY BODILY DEFECT IN ANOTHER HE WILL BE PATIENT OF IT AND
WILL LOVE ALL THE SAME
I PERCEIVE I SAID THAT YOU HAVE OR HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES OF THIS SORT
AND I AGREE
BUT LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION HAS EXCESS OF PLEASURE
ANY AFFINITY TO TEMPERANCE
HOW CAN THAT BE HE REPLIED PLEASURE DEPRIVES A MAN OF THE USE OF HIS
FACULTIES QUITE AS MUCH AS PAIN
OR ANY AFFINITY TO VIRTUE IN GENERAL
NONE WHATEVER
ANY AFFINITY TO WANTONNESS AND INTEMPERANCE
YES THE GREATEST
AND IS THERE ANY GREATER OR KEENER PLEASURE THAN THAT OF SENSUAL LOVE
NO NOR A MADDER
WHEREAS TRUE LOVE IS A LOVE OF BEAUTY AND ORDER TEMPERATE AND
HARMONIOUS
QUITE TRUE HE SAID
THEN NO INTEMPERANCE OR MADNESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO APPROACH TRUE LOVE
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN MAD OR INTEMPERATE PLEASURE MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO COME NEAR THE
LOVER AND HIS BELOVED NEITHER OF THEM CAN HAVE ANY PART IN IT IF THEIR
LOVE IS OF THE RIGHT SORT
NO INDEED SOCRATES IT MUST NEVER COME NEAR THEM
THEN I SUPPOSE THAT IN THE CITY WHICH WE ARE FOUNDING YOU WOULD MAKE A
LAW TO THE EFFECT THAT A FRIEND SHOULD USE NO OTHER FAMILIARITY TO
HIS LOVE THAN A FATHER WOULD USE TO HIS SON AND THEN ONLY FOR A NOBLE
PURPOSE AND HE MUST FIRST HAVE THE OTHER'S CONSENT AND THIS RULE IS
TO LIMIT HIM IN ALL HIS INTERCOURSE AND HE IS NEVER TO BE SEEN GOING
FURTHER OR IF HE EXCEEDS HE IS TO BE DEEMED GUILTY OF COARSENESS AND
BAD TASTE
I QUITE AGREE HE SAID
THUS MUCH OF MUSIC WHICH MAKES A FAIR ENDING FOR WHAT SHOULD BE THE
END OF MUSIC IF NOT THE LOVE OF BEAUTY
I AGREE HE SAID
AFTER MUSIC COMES GYMNASTIC IN WHICH OUR YOUTH ARE NEXT TO BE TRAINED
CERTAINLY
GYMNASTIC AS WELL AS MUSIC SHOULD BEGIN IN EARLY YEARS THE TRAINING
IN IT SHOULD BE CAREFUL AND SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH LIFE
NOW MY BELIEF
IS AND THIS IS A MATTER UPON WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR OPINION
IN CONFIRMATION OF MY OWN BUT MY OWN BELIEF IS NOT THAT THE GOOD BODY
BY ANY BODILY EXCELLENCE IMPROVES THE SOUL BUT ON THE CONTRARY THAT
THE GOOD SOUL BY HER OWN EXCELLENCE IMPROVES THE BODY AS FAR AS THIS
MAY BE POSSIBLE
WHAT DO YOU SAY
YES I AGREE
THEN TO THE MIND WHEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED WE SHALL BE RIGHT IN HANDING
OVER THE MORE PARTICULAR CARE OF THE BODY AND IN ORDER TO AVOID
PROLIXITY WE WILL NOW ONLY GIVE THE GENERAL OUTLINES OF THE SUBJECT
VERY GOOD
THAT THEY MUST ABSTAIN FROM INTOXICATION HAS BEEN ALREADY REMARKED BY
US FOR OF ALL PERSONS A GUARDIAN SHOULD BE THE LAST TO GET DRUNK AND
NOT KNOW WHERE IN THE WORLD HE IS
YES HE SAID THAT A GUARDIAN SHOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER GUARDIAN TO TAKE
CARE OF HIM IS RIDICULOUS INDEED
BUT NEXT WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF THEIR FOOD FOR THE MEN ARE IN TRAINING
FOR THE GREAT CONTEST OF ALL ARE THEY NOT
YES HE SAID
AND WILL THE HABIT OF BODY OF OUR ORDINARY ATHLETES BE SUITED TO THEM
WHY NOT
I AM AFRAID I SAID THAT A HABIT OF BODY SUCH AS THEY HAVE IS BUT A
SLEEPY SORT OF THING AND RATHER PERILOUS TO HEALTH
DO YOU NOT OBSERVE
THAT THESE ATHLETES SLEEP AWAY THEIR LIVES AND ARE LIABLE TO MOST
DANGEROUS ILLNESSES IF THEY DEPART IN EVER SO SLIGHT A DEGREE FROM
THEIR CUSTOMARY REGIMEN
YES I DO
THEN I SAID A FINER SORT OF TRAINING WILL BE REQUIRED FOR OUR WARRIOR
ATHLETES WHO ARE TO BE LIKE WAKEFUL DOGS AND TO SEE AND HEAR WITH THE
UTMOST KEENNESS AMID THE MANY CHANGES OF WATER AND ALSO OF FOOD OF
SUMMER HEAT AND WINTER COLD WHICH THEY WILL HAVE TO ENDURE WHEN ON A
CAMPAIGN THEY MUST NOT BE LIABLE TO BREAK DOWN IN HEALTH
THAT IS MY VIEW
THE REALLY EXCELLENT GYMNASTIC IS TWIN SISTER OF THAT SIMPLE MUSIC WHICH
WE WERE JUST NOW DESCRIBING
HOW SO
WHY I CONCEIVE THAT THERE IS A GYMNASTIC WHICH LIKE OUR MUSIC IS
SIMPLE AND GOOD AND ESPECIALLY THE MILITARY GYMNASTIC
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
MY MEANING MAY BE LEARNED FROM HOMER HE YOU KNOW FEEDS HIS HEROES AT
THEIR FEASTS WHEN THEY ARE CAMPAIGNING ON SOLDIERS' FARE THEY HAVE
NO FISH ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ON THE SHORES OF THE HELLESPONT AND THEY
ARE NOT ALLOWED BOILED MEATS BUT ONLY ROAST WHICH IS THE FOOD MOST
CONVENIENT FOR SOLDIERS REQUIRING ONLY THAT THEY SHOULD LIGHT A FIRE
AND NOT INVOLVING THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING ABOUT POTS AND PANS
TRUE
AND I CAN HARDLY BE MISTAKEN IN SAYING THAT SWEET SAUCES ARE NOWHERE
MENTIONED IN HOMER
IN PROSCRIBING THEM HOWEVER HE IS NOT SINGULAR
ALL PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES ARE WELL AWARE THAT A MAN WHO IS TO BE IN GOOD
CONDITION SHOULD TAKE NOTHING OF THE KIND
YES HE SAID AND KNOWING THIS THEY ARE QUITE RIGHT IN NOT TAKING THEM
THEN YOU WOULD NOT APPROVE OF SYRACUSAN DINNERS AND THE REFINEMENTS OF
SICILIAN COOKERY
I THINK NOT
NOR IF A MAN IS TO BE IN CONDITION WOULD YOU ALLOW HIM TO HAVE A
CORINTHIAN GIRL AS HIS FAIR FRIEND
CERTAINLY NOT
NEITHER WOULD YOU APPROVE OF THE DELICACIES AS THEY ARE THOUGHT OF
ATHENIAN CONFECTIONARY
CERTAINLY NOT
ALL SUCH FEEDING AND LIVING MAY BE RIGHTLY COMPARED BY US TO MELODY AND
SONG COMPOSED IN THE PANHARMONIC STYLE AND IN ALL THE RHYTHMS
EXACTLY
THERE COMPLEXITY ENGENDERED LICENCE AND HERE DISEASE WHEREAS
SIMPLICITY IN MUSIC WAS THE PARENT OF TEMPERANCE IN THE SOUL AND
SIMPLICITY IN GYMNASTIC OF HEALTH IN THE BODY
MOST TRUE HE SAID
BUT WHEN INTEMPERANCE AND DISEASES MULTIPLY IN A STATE HALLS OF JUSTICE
AND MEDICINE ARE ALWAYS BEING OPENED AND THE ARTS OF THE DOCTOR AND THE
LAWYER GIVE THEMSELVES AIRS FINDING HOW KEEN IS THE INTEREST WHICH NOT
ONLY THE SLAVES BUT THE FREEMEN OF A CITY TAKE ABOUT THEM
OF COURSE
AND YET WHAT GREATER PROOF CAN THERE BE OF A BAD AND DISGRACEFUL STATE
OF EDUCATION THAN THIS THAT NOT ONLY ARTISANS AND THE MEANER SORT OF
PEOPLE NEED THE SKILL OF FIRST RATE PHYSICIANS AND JUDGES BUT ALSO
THOSE WHO WOULD PROFESS TO HAVE HAD A LIBERAL EDUCATION IS IT NOT
DISGRACEFUL AND A GREAT SIGN OF WANT OF GOOD BREEDING THAT A MAN
SHOULD HAVE TO GO ABROAD FOR HIS LAW AND PHYSIC BECAUSE HE HAS NONE OF
HIS OWN AT HOME AND MUST THEREFORE SURRENDER HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS OF
OTHER MEN WHOM HE MAKES LORDS AND JUDGES OVER HIM
OF ALL THINGS HE SAID THE MOST DISGRACEFUL
WOULD YOU SAY 'MOST I REPLIED WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THERE IS
A FURTHER STAGE OF THE EVIL IN WHICH A MAN IS NOT ONLY A LIFE LONG
LITIGANT PASSING ALL HIS DAYS IN THE COURTS EITHER AS PLAINTIFF OR
DEFENDANT BUT IS ACTUALLY LED BY HIS BAD TASTE TO PRIDE HIMSELF ON HIS
LITIGIOUSNESS HE IMAGINES THAT HE IS A MASTER IN DISHONESTY ABLE TO
TAKE EVERY CROOKED TURN AND WRIGGLE INTO AND OUT OF EVERY HOLE
BENDING LIKE A WITHY AND GETTING OUT OF THE WAY OF JUSTICE AND ALL
FOR WHAT IN ORDER TO GAIN SMALL POINTS NOT WORTH MENTIONING HE NOT
KNOWING THAT SO TO ORDER HIS LIFE AS TO BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT A NAPPING
JUDGE IS A FAR HIGHER AND NOBLER SORT OF THING
IS NOT THAT STILL MORE
DISGRACEFUL
YES HE SAID THAT IS STILL MORE DISGRACEFUL
WELL I SAID AND TO REQUIRE THE HELP OF MEDICINE NOT WHEN A WOUND
HAS TO BE CURED OR ON OCCASION OF AN EPIDEMIC BUT JUST BECAUSE BY
INDOLENCE AND A HABIT OF LIFE SUCH AS WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING MEN
FILL THEMSELVES WITH WATERS AND WINDS AS IF THEIR BODIES WERE A MARSH
COMPELLING THE INGENIOUS SONS OF ASCLEPIUS TO FIND MORE NAMES FOR
DISEASES SUCH AS FLATULENCE AND CATARRH IS NOT THIS TOO A DISGRACE
YES HE SAID THEY DO CERTAINLY GIVE VERY STRANGE AND NEWFANGLED NAMES
TO DISEASES
YES I SAID AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE ANY SUCH DISEASES IN
THE DAYS OF ASCLEPIUS AND THIS I INFER FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE
HERO EURYPYLUS AFTER HE HAS BEEN WOUNDED IN HOMER DRINKS A POSSET OF
PRAMNIAN WINE WELL BESPRINKLED WITH BARLEY MEAL AND GRATED CHEESE WHICH
ARE CERTAINLY INFLAMMATORY AND YET THE SONS OF ASCLEPIUS WHO WERE
AT THE TROJAN WAR DO NOT BLAME THE DAMSEL WHO GIVES HIM THE DRINK OR
REBUKE PATROCLUS WHO IS TREATING HIS CASE
WELL HE SAID THAT WAS SURELY AN EXTRAORDINARY DRINK TO BE GIVEN TO A
PERSON IN HIS CONDITION
NOT SO EXTRAORDINARY I REPLIED IF YOU BEAR IN MIND THAT IN FORMER
DAYS AS IS COMMONLY SAID BEFORE THE TIME OF HERODICUS THE GUILD OF
ASCLEPIUS DID NOT PRACTISE OUR PRESENT SYSTEM OF MEDICINE WHICH MAY BE
SAID TO EDUCATE DISEASES
BUT HERODICUS BEING A TRAINER AND HIMSELF OF
A SICKLY CONSTITUTION BY A COMBINATION OF TRAINING AND DOCTORING FOUND
OUT A WAY OF TORTURING FIRST AND CHIEFLY HIMSELF AND SECONDLY THE REST
OF THE WORLD
HOW WAS THAT HE SAID
BY THE INVENTION OF LINGERING DEATH FOR HE HAD A MORTAL DISEASE WHICH
HE PERPETUALLY TENDED AND AS RECOVERY WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION HE
PASSED HIS ENTIRE LIFE AS A VALETUDINARIAN HE COULD DO NOTHING BUT
ATTEND UPON HIMSELF AND HE WAS IN CONSTANT TORMENT WHENEVER HE DEPARTED
IN ANYTHING FROM HIS USUAL REGIMEN AND SO DYING HARD BY THE HELP OF
SCIENCE HE STRUGGLED ON TO OLD AGE
A RARE REWARD OF HIS SKILL
YES I SAID A REWARD WHICH A MAN MIGHT FAIRLY EXPECT WHO NEVER
UNDERSTOOD THAT IF ASCLEPIUS DID NOT INSTRUCT HIS DESCENDANTS
IN VALETUDINARIAN ARTS THE OMISSION AROSE NOT FROM IGNORANCE OR
INEXPERIENCE OF SUCH A BRANCH OF MEDICINE BUT BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IN
ALL WELL ORDERED STATES EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS AN OCCUPATION TO WHICH HE
MUST ATTEND AND HAS THEREFORE NO LEISURE TO SPEND IN CONTINUALLY BEING
ILL
THIS WE REMARK IN THE CASE OF THE ARTISAN BUT LUDICROUSLY ENOUGH
DO NOT APPLY THE SAME RULE TO PEOPLE OF THE RICHER SORT
HOW DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
I MEAN THIS WHEN A CARPENTER IS ILL HE ASKS THE PHYSICIAN FOR A ROUGH
AND READY CURE AN EMETIC OR A PURGE OR A CAUTERY OR THE KNIFE THESE
ARE HIS REMEDIES
AND IF SOME ONE PRESCRIBES FOR HIM A COURSE OF
DIETETICS AND TELLS HIM THAT HE MUST SWATHE AND SWADDLE HIS HEAD AND
ALL THAT SORT OF THING HE REPLIES AT ONCE THAT HE HAS NO TIME TO BE
ILL AND THAT HE SEES NO GOOD IN A LIFE WHICH IS SPENT IN NURSING
HIS DISEASE TO THE NEGLECT OF HIS CUSTOMARY EMPLOYMENT AND THEREFORE
BIDDING GOOD BYE TO THIS SORT OF PHYSICIAN HE RESUMES HIS ORDINARY
HABITS AND EITHER GETS WELL AND LIVES AND DOES HIS BUSINESS OR IF HIS
CONSTITUTION FAILS HE DIES AND HAS NO MORE TROUBLE
YES HE SAID AND A MAN IN HIS CONDITION OF LIFE OUGHT TO USE THE ART OF
MEDICINE THUS FAR ONLY
HAS HE NOT I SAID AN OCCUPATION AND WHAT PROFIT WOULD THERE BE IN HIS
LIFE IF HE WERE DEPRIVED OF HIS OCCUPATION
QUITE TRUE HE SAID
BUT WITH THE RICH MAN THIS IS OTHERWISE OF HIM WE DO NOT SAY THAT HE
HAS ANY SPECIALLY APPOINTED WORK WHICH HE MUST PERFORM IF HE WOULD
LIVE
HE IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO
THEN YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE SAYING OF PHOCYLIDES THAT AS SOON AS A MAN
HAS A LIVELIHOOD HE SHOULD PRACTISE VIRTUE
NAY HE SAID I THINK THAT HE HAD BETTER BEGIN SOMEWHAT SOONER
LET US NOT HAVE A DISPUTE WITH HIM ABOUT THIS I SAID BUT RATHER ASK
OURSELVES IS THE PRACTICE OF VIRTUE OBLIGATORY ON THE RICH MAN OR
CAN HE LIVE WITHOUT IT AND IF OBLIGATORY ON HIM THEN LET US RAISE
A FURTHER QUESTION WHETHER THIS DIETING OF DISORDERS WHICH IS AN
IMPEDIMENT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE MIND IN CARPENTERING AND THE
MECHANICAL ARTS DOES NOT EQUALLY STAND IN THE WAY OF THE SENTIMENT OF
PHOCYLIDES
OF THAT HE REPLIED THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT SUCH EXCESSIVE CARE OF THE
BODY WHEN CARRIED BEYOND THE RULES OF GYMNASTIC IS MOST INIMICAL TO
THE PRACTICE OF VIRTUE
YES INDEED I REPLIED AND EQUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF
A HOUSE AN ARMY OR AN OFFICE OF STATE AND WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT
OF ALL IRRECONCILEABLE WITH ANY KIND OF STUDY OR THOUGHT OR
SELF REFLECTION THERE IS A CONSTANT SUSPICION THAT HEADACHE AND
GIDDINESS ARE TO BE ASCRIBED TO PHILOSOPHY AND HENCE ALL PRACTISING OR
MAKING TRIAL OF VIRTUE IN THE HIGHER SENSE IS ABSOLUTELY STOPPED FOR
A MAN IS ALWAYS FANCYING THAT HE IS BEING MADE ILL AND IS IN CONSTANT
ANXIETY ABOUT THE STATE OF HIS BODY
YES LIKELY ENOUGH
AND THEREFORE OUR POLITIC ASCLEPIUS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE EXHIBITED
THE POWER OF HIS ART ONLY TO PERSONS WHO BEING GENERALLY OF HEALTHY
CONSTITUTION AND HABITS OF LIFE HAD A DEFINITE AILMENT SUCH AS THESE
HE CURED BY PURGES AND OPERATIONS AND BADE THEM LIVE AS USUAL HEREIN
CONSULTING THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE BUT BODIES WHICH DISEASE HAD
PENETRATED THROUGH AND THROUGH HE WOULD NOT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CURE
BY GRADUAL PROCESSES OF EVACUATION AND INFUSION HE DID NOT WANT TO
LENGTHEN OUT GOOD FOR NOTHING LIVES OR TO HAVE WEAK FATHERS BEGETTING
WEAKER SONS IF A MAN WAS NOT ABLE TO LIVE IN THE ORDINARY WAY HE
HAD NO BUSINESS TO CURE HIM FOR SUCH A CURE WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO USE
EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO THE STATE
THEN HE SAID YOU REGARD ASCLEPIUS AS A STATESMAN
CLEARLY AND HIS CHARACTER IS FURTHER ILLUSTRATED BY HIS SONS
NOTE THAT
THEY WERE HEROES IN THE DAYS OF OLD AND PRACTISED THE MEDICINES OF WHICH
I AM SPEAKING AT THE SIEGE OF TROY YOU WILL REMEMBER HOW WHEN PANDARUS
WOUNDED MENELAUS THEY
'SUCKED THE BLOOD OUT OF THE WOUND AND SPRINKLED SOOTHING REMEDIES
BUT THEY NEVER PRESCRIBED WHAT THE PATIENT WAS AFTERWARDS TO EAT OR
DRINK IN THE CASE OF MENELAUS ANY MORE THAN IN THE CASE OF EURYPYLUS
THE REMEDIES AS THEY CONCEIVED WERE ENOUGH TO HEAL ANY MAN WHO BEFORE
HE WAS WOUNDED WAS HEALTHY AND REGULAR IN HIS HABITS AND EVEN THOUGH HE
DID HAPPEN TO DRINK A POSSET OF PRAMNIAN WINE HE MIGHT GET WELL ALL THE
SAME
BUT THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH UNHEALTHY AND INTEMPERATE
SUBJECTS WHOSE LIVES WERE OF NO USE EITHER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS THE
ART OF MEDICINE WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THEIR GOOD AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS
RICH AS MIDAS THE SONS OF ASCLEPIUS WOULD HAVE DECLINED TO ATTEND THEM
THEY WERE VERY ACUTE PERSONS THOSE SONS OF ASCLEPIUS
NATURALLY SO I REPLIED
NEVERTHELESS THE TRAGEDIANS AND PINDAR
DISOBEYING OUR BEHESTS ALTHOUGH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ASCLEPIUS WAS THE
SON OF APOLLO SAY ALSO THAT HE WAS BRIBED INTO HEALING A RICH MAN
WHO WAS AT THE POINT OF DEATH AND FOR THIS REASON HE WAS STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING
BUT WE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY AFFIRMED BY
US WILL NOT BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY TELL US BOTH IF HE WAS THE SON OF
A GOD WE MAINTAIN THAT HE WAS NOT AVARICIOUS OR IF HE WAS AVARICIOUS
HE WAS NOT THE SON OF A GOD
ALL THAT SOCRATES IS EXCELLENT BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO PUT A QUESTION TO
YOU OUGHT THERE NOT TO BE GOOD PHYSICIANS IN A STATE AND ARE NOT THE
BEST THOSE WHO HAVE TREATED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF CONSTITUTIONS GOOD
AND BAD AND ARE NOT THE BEST JUDGES IN LIKE MANNER THOSE WHO ARE
ACQUAINTED WITH ALL SORTS OF MORAL NATURES
YES I SAID I TOO WOULD HAVE GOOD JUDGES AND GOOD PHYSICIANS
BUT DO
YOU KNOW WHOM I THINK GOOD
WILL YOU TELL ME
I WILL IF I CAN
LET ME HOWEVER NOTE THAT IN THE SAME QUESTION YOU JOIN
TWO THINGS WHICH ARE NOT THE SAME
HOW SO HE ASKED
WHY I SAID YOU JOIN PHYSICIANS AND JUDGES
NOW THE MOST SKILFUL
PHYSICIANS ARE THOSE WHO FROM THEIR YOUTH UPWARDS HAVE COMBINED WITH
THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR ART THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE OF DISEASE THEY
HAD BETTER NOT BE ROBUST IN HEALTH AND SHOULD HAVE HAD ALL MANNER OF
DISEASES IN THEIR OWN PERSONS
FOR THE BODY AS I CONCEIVE IS NOT THE
INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH THEY CURE THE BODY IN THAT CASE WE COULD NOT
ALLOW THEM EVER TO BE OR TO HAVE BEEN SICKLY BUT THEY CURE THE BODY
WITH THE MIND AND THE MIND WHICH HAS BECOME AND IS SICK CAN CURE
NOTHING
THAT IS VERY TRUE HE SAID
BUT WITH THE JUDGE IT IS OTHERWISE SINCE HE GOVERNS MIND BY MIND HE
OUGHT NOT THEREFORE TO HAVE BEEN TRAINED AMONG VICIOUS MINDS AND TO
HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM FROM YOUTH UPWARDS AND TO HAVE GONE THROUGH
THE WHOLE CALENDAR OF CRIME ONLY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY QUICKLY INFER
THE CRIMES OF OTHERS AS HE MIGHT THEIR BODILY DISEASES FROM HIS OWN
SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THE HONOURABLE MIND WHICH IS TO FORM A HEALTHY
JUDGMENT SHOULD HAVE HAD NO EXPERIENCE OR CONTAMINATION OF EVIL HABITS
WHEN YOUNG
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY IN YOUTH GOOD MEN OFTEN APPEAR TO
BE SIMPLE AND ARE EASILY PRACTISED UPON BY THE DISHONEST BECAUSE THEY
HAVE NO EXAMPLES OF WHAT EVIL IS IN THEIR OWN SOULS
YES HE SAID THEY ARE FAR TOO APT TO BE DECEIVED
THEREFORE I SAID THE JUDGE SHOULD NOT BE YOUNG HE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED
TO KNOW EVIL NOT FROM HIS OWN SOUL BUT FROM LATE AND LONG OBSERVATION
OF THE NATURE OF EVIL IN OTHERS KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE HIS GUIDE NOT
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE IDEAL OF A JUDGE
YES I REPLIED AND HE WILL BE A GOOD MAN WHICH IS MY ANSWER TO YOUR
QUESTION FOR HE IS GOOD WHO HAS A GOOD SOUL
BUT THE CUNNING AND
SUSPICIOUS NATURE OF WHICH WE SPOKE HE WHO HAS COMMITTED MANY CRIMES
AND FANCIES HIMSELF TO BE A MASTER IN WICKEDNESS WHEN HE IS AMONGST
HIS FELLOWS IS WONDERFUL IN THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HE TAKES BECAUSE HE
JUDGES OF THEM BY HIMSELF BUT WHEN HE GETS INTO THE COMPANY OF MEN OF
VIRTUE WHO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF AGE HE APPEARS TO BE A FOOL AGAIN
OWING TO HIS UNSEASONABLE SUSPICIONS HE CANNOT RECOGNISE AN HONEST MAN
BECAUSE HE HAS NO PATTERN OF HONESTY IN HIMSELF AT THE SAME TIME AS
THE BAD ARE MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE GOOD AND HE MEETS WITH THEM OFTENER
HE THINKS HIMSELF AND IS BY OTHERS THOUGHT TO BE RATHER WISE THAN
FOOLISH
MOST TRUE HE SAID
THEN THE GOOD AND WISE JUDGE WHOM WE ARE SEEKING IS NOT THIS MAN BUT
THE OTHER FOR VICE CANNOT KNOW VIRTUE TOO BUT A VIRTUOUS NATURE
EDUCATED BY TIME WILL ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE BOTH OF VIRTUE AND VICE THE
VIRTUOUS AND NOT THE VICIOUS MAN HAS WISDOM IN MY OPINION
AND IN MINE ALSO
THIS IS THE SORT OF MEDICINE AND THIS IS THE SORT OF LAW WHICH YOU
WILL SANCTION IN YOUR STATE
THEY WILL MINISTER TO BETTER NATURES
GIVING HEALTH BOTH OF SOUL AND OF BODY BUT THOSE WHO ARE DISEASED IN
THEIR BODIES THEY WILL LEAVE TO DIE AND THE CORRUPT AND INCURABLE SOULS
THEY WILL PUT AN END TO THEMSELVES
THAT IS CLEARLY THE BEST THING BOTH FOR THE PATIENTS AND FOR THE STATE
AND THUS OUR YOUTH HAVING BEEN EDUCATED ONLY IN THAT SIMPLE MUSIC
WHICH AS WE SAID INSPIRES TEMPERANCE WILL BE RELUCTANT TO GO TO LAW
CLEARLY
AND THE MUSICIAN WHO KEEPING TO THE SAME TRACK IS CONTENT TO PRACTISE
THE SIMPLE GYMNASTIC WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MEDICINE UNLESS IN
SOME EXTREME CASE
THAT I QUITE BELIEVE
THE VERY EXERCISES AND TOLLS WHICH HE UNDERGOES ARE INTENDED TO
STIMULATE THE SPIRITED ELEMENT OF HIS NATURE AND NOT TO INCREASE HIS
STRENGTH HE WILL NOT LIKE COMMON ATHLETES USE EXERCISE AND REGIMEN TO
DEVELOPE HIS MUSCLES
VERY RIGHT HE SAID
NEITHER ARE THE TWO ARTS OF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC REALLY DESIGNED AS IS
OFTEN SUPPOSED THE ONE FOR THE TRAINING OF THE SOUL THE OTHER FOR THE
TRAINING OF THE BODY
WHAT THEN IS THE REAL OBJECT OF THEM
I BELIEVE I SAID THAT THE TEACHERS OF BOTH HAVE IN VIEW CHIEFLY THE
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOUL
HOW CAN THAT BE HE ASKED
DID YOU NEVER OBSERVE I SAID THE EFFECT ON THE MIND ITSELF OF
EXCLUSIVE DEVOTION TO GYMNASTIC OR THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF AN EXCLUSIVE
DEVOTION TO MUSIC
IN WHAT WAY SHOWN HE SAID
THE ONE PRODUCING A TEMPER OF HARDNESS AND FEROCITY THE OTHER OF
SOFTNESS AND EFFEMINACY I REPLIED
YES HE SAID I AM QUITE AWARE THAT THE MERE ATHLETE BECOMES TOO MUCH OF
A SAVAGE AND THAT THE MERE MUSICIAN IS MELTED AND SOFTENED BEYOND WHAT
IS GOOD FOR HIM
YET SURELY I SAID THIS FEROCITY ONLY COMES FROM SPIRIT WHICH IF
RIGHTLY EDUCATED WOULD GIVE COURAGE BUT IF TOO MUCH INTENSIFIED IS
LIABLE TO BECOME HARD AND BRUTAL
THAT I QUITE THINK
ON THE OTHER HAND THE PHILOSOPHER WILL HAVE THE QUALITY OF GENTLENESS
AND THIS ALSO WHEN TOO MUCH INDULGED WILL TURN TO SOFTNESS BUT IF
EDUCATED RIGHTLY WILL BE GENTLE AND MODERATE
TRUE
AND IN OUR OPINION THE GUARDIANS OUGHT TO HAVE BOTH THESE QUALITIES
ASSUREDLY
AND BOTH SHOULD BE IN HARMONY
BEYOND QUESTION
AND THE HARMONIOUS SOUL IS BOTH TEMPERATE AND COURAGEOUS
YES
AND THE INHARMONIOUS IS COWARDLY AND BOORISH
VERY TRUE
AND WHEN A MAN ALLOWS MUSIC TO PLAY UPON HIM AND TO POUR INTO HIS SOUL
THROUGH THE FUNNEL OF HIS EARS THOSE SWEET AND SOFT AND MELANCHOLY AIRS
OF WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW SPEAKING AND HIS WHOLE LIFE IS PASSED IN
WARBLING AND THE DELIGHTS OF SONG IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE PROCESS
THE PASSION OR SPIRIT WHICH IS IN HIM IS TEMPERED LIKE IRON AND MADE
USEFUL INSTEAD OF BRITTLE AND USELESS
BUT IF HE CARRIES ON THE
SOFTENING AND SOOTHING PROCESS IN THE NEXT STAGE HE BEGINS TO MELT AND
WASTE UNTIL HE HAS WASTED AWAY HIS SPIRIT AND CUT OUT THE SINEWS OF HIS
SOUL AND HE BECOMES A FEEBLE WARRIOR
VERY TRUE
IF THE ELEMENT OF SPIRIT IS NATURALLY WEAK IN HIM THE CHANGE IS SPEEDILY
ACCOMPLISHED BUT IF HE HAVE A GOOD DEAL THEN THE POWER OF MUSIC
WEAKENING THE SPIRIT RENDERS HIM EXCITABLE ON THE LEAST PROVOCATION
HE FLAMES UP AT ONCE AND IS SPEEDILY EXTINGUISHED INSTEAD OF HAVING
SPIRIT HE GROWS IRRITABLE AND PASSIONATE AND IS QUITE IMPRACTICABLE
EXACTLY
AND SO IN GYMNASTICS IF A MAN TAKES VIOLENT EXERCISE AND IS A GREAT
FEEDER AND THE REVERSE OF A GREAT STUDENT OF MUSIC AND PHILOSOPHY AT
FIRST THE HIGH CONDITION OF HIS BODY FILLS HIM WITH PRIDE AND SPIRIT
AND HE BECOMES TWICE THE MAN THAT HE WAS
CERTAINLY
AND WHAT HAPPENS IF HE DO NOTHING ELSE AND HOLDS NO CONVERSE WITH THE
MUSES DOES NOT EVEN THAT INTELLIGENCE WHICH THERE MAY BE IN HIM HAVING
NO TASTE OF ANY SORT OF LEARNING OR ENQUIRY OR THOUGHT OR CULTURE
GROW FEEBLE AND DULL AND BLIND HIS MIND NEVER WAKING UP OR RECEIVING
NOURISHMENT AND HIS SENSES NOT BEING PURGED OF THEIR MISTS
TRUE HE SAID
AND HE ENDS BY BECOMING A HATER OF PHILOSOPHY UNCIVILIZED NEVER USING
THE WEAPON OF PERSUASION HE IS LIKE A WILD BEAST ALL VIOLENCE AND
FIERCENESS AND KNOWS NO OTHER WAY OF DEALING AND HE LIVES IN ALL
IGNORANCE AND EVIL CONDITIONS AND HAS NO SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND GRACE
THAT IS QUITE TRUE HE SAID
AND AS THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPLES OF HUMAN NATURE ONE THE SPIRITED
AND THE OTHER THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOME GOD AS I SHOULD SAY HAS GIVEN
MANKIND TWO ARTS ANSWERING TO THEM AND ONLY INDIRECTLY TO THE SOUL
AND BODY IN ORDER THAT THESE TWO PRINCIPLES LIKE THE STRINGS OF
AN INSTRUMENT MAY BE RELAXED OR DRAWN TIGHTER UNTIL THEY ARE DULY
HARMONIZED
THAT APPEARS TO BE THE INTENTION
AND HE WHO MINGLES MUSIC WITH GYMNASTIC IN THE FAIREST PROPORTIONS AND
BEST ATTEMPERS THEM TO THE SOUL MAY BE RIGHTLY CALLED THE TRUE MUSICIAN
AND HARMONIST IN A FAR HIGHER SENSE THAN THE TUNER OF THE STRINGS
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SOCRATES
AND SUCH A PRESIDING GENIUS WILL BE ALWAYS REQUIRED IN OUR STATE IF THE
GOVERNMENT IS TO LAST
YES HE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
SUCH THEN ARE OUR PRINCIPLES OF NURTURE AND EDUCATION WHERE WOULD BE
THE USE OF GOING INTO FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE DANCES OF OUR CITIZENS
OR ABOUT THEIR HUNTING AND COURSING THEIR GYMNASTIC AND EQUESTRIAN
CONTESTS FOR THESE ALL FOLLOW THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE AND HAVING FOUND
THAT WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCOVERING THEM
I DARE SAY THAT THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY
VERY GOOD I SAID THEN WHAT IS THE NEXT QUESTION MUST WE NOT ASK WHO
ARE TO BE RULERS AND WHO SUBJECTS
CERTAINLY
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE ELDER MUST RULE THE YOUNGER
CLEARLY
AND THAT THE BEST OF THESE MUST RULE
THAT IS ALSO CLEAR
NOW ARE NOT THE BEST HUSBANDMEN THOSE WHO ARE MOST DEVOTED TO
HUSBANDRY
YES
AND AS WE ARE TO HAVE THE BEST OF GUARDIANS FOR OUR CITY MUST THEY NOT
BE THOSE WHO HAVE MOST THE CHARACTER OF GUARDIANS
YES
AND TO THIS END THEY OUGHT TO BE WISE AND EFFICIENT AND TO HAVE A
SPECIAL CARE OF THE STATE
TRUE
AND A MAN WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO CARE ABOUT THAT WHICH HE LOVES
TO BE SURE
AND HE WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO LOVE THAT WHICH HE REGARDS AS HAVING THE
SAME INTERESTS WITH HIMSELF AND THAT OF WHICH THE GOOD OR EVIL FORTUNE
IS SUPPOSED BY HIM AT ANY TIME MOST TO AFFECT HIS OWN
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
THEN THERE MUST BE A SELECTION
LET US NOTE AMONG THE GUARDIANS THOSE
WHO IN THEIR WHOLE LIFE SHOW THE GREATEST EAGERNESS TO DO WHAT IS FOR
THE GOOD OF THEIR COUNTRY AND THE GREATEST REPUGNANCE TO DO WHAT IS
AGAINST HER INTERESTS
THOSE ARE THE RIGHT MEN
AND THEY WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED AT EVERY AGE IN ORDER THAT WE MAY SEE
WHETHER THEY PRESERVE THEIR RESOLUTION AND NEVER UNDER THE INFLUENCE
EITHER OF FORCE OR ENCHANTMENT FORGET OR CAST OFF THEIR SENSE OF DUTY
TO THE STATE
HOW CAST OFF HE SAID
I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU I REPLIED
A RESOLUTION MAY GO OUT OF A MAN'S
MIND EITHER WITH HIS WILL OR AGAINST HIS WILL WITH HIS WILL WHEN HE
GETS RID OF A FALSEHOOD AND LEARNS BETTER AGAINST HIS WILL WHENEVER HE
IS DEPRIVED OF A TRUTH
I UNDERSTAND HE SAID THE WILLING LOSS OF A RESOLUTION THE MEANING OF
THE UNWILLING I HAVE YET TO LEARN
WHY I SAID DO YOU NOT SEE THAT MEN ARE UNWILLINGLY DEPRIVED OF GOOD
AND WILLINGLY OF EVIL IS NOT TO HAVE LOST THE TRUTH AN EVIL AND TO
POSSESS THE TRUTH A GOOD AND YOU WOULD AGREE THAT TO CONCEIVE THINGS AS
THEY ARE IS TO POSSESS THE TRUTH
YES HE REPLIED I AGREE WITH YOU IN THINKING THAT MANKIND ARE DEPRIVED
OF TRUTH AGAINST THEIR WILL
AND IS NOT THIS INVOLUNTARY DEPRIVATION CAUSED EITHER BY THEFT OR
FORCE OR ENCHANTMENT
STILL HE REPLIED I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU
I FEAR THAT I MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING DARKLY LIKE THE TRAGEDIANS
I ONLY
MEAN THAT SOME MEN ARE CHANGED BY PERSUASION AND THAT OTHERS FORGET
ARGUMENT STEALS AWAY THE HEARTS OF ONE CLASS AND TIME OF THE OTHER AND
THIS I CALL THEFT
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND ME
YES
THOSE AGAIN WHO ARE FORCED ARE THOSE WHOM THE VIOLENCE OF SOME PAIN OR
GRIEF COMPELS TO CHANGE THEIR OPINION
I UNDERSTAND HE SAID AND YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
AND YOU WOULD ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ENCHANTED ARE THOSE WHO CHANGE
THEIR MINDS EITHER UNDER THE SOFTER INFLUENCE OF PLEASURE OR THE
STERNER INFLUENCE OF FEAR
YES HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT DECEIVES MAY BE SAID TO ENCHANT
THEREFORE AS I WAS JUST NOW SAYING WE MUST ENQUIRE WHO ARE THE BEST
GUARDIANS OF THEIR OWN CONVICTION THAT WHAT THEY THINK THE INTEREST
OF THE STATE IS TO BE THE RULE OF THEIR LIVES
WE MUST WATCH THEM FROM
THEIR YOUTH UPWARDS AND MAKE THEM PERFORM ACTIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE
MOST LIKELY TO FORGET OR TO BE DECEIVED AND HE WHO REMEMBERS AND IS
NOT DECEIVED IS TO BE SELECTED AND HE WHO FAILS IN THE TRIAL IS TO BE
REJECTED
THAT WILL BE THE WAY
YES
AND THERE SHOULD ALSO BE TOILS AND PAINS AND CONFLICTS PRESCRIBED FOR
THEM IN WHICH THEY WILL BE MADE TO GIVE FURTHER PROOF OF THE SAME
QUALITIES
VERY RIGHT HE REPLIED
AND THEN I SAID WE MUST TRY THEM WITH ENCHANTMENTS THAT IS THE THIRD
SORT OF TEST AND SEE WHAT WILL BE THEIR BEHAVIOUR LIKE THOSE WHO TAKE
COLTS AMID NOISE AND TUMULT TO SEE IF THEY ARE OF A TIMID NATURE SO
MUST WE TAKE OUR YOUTH AMID TERRORS OF SOME KIND AND AGAIN PASS THEM
INTO PLEASURES AND PROVE THEM MORE THOROUGHLY THAN GOLD IS PROVED IN
THE FURNACE THAT WE MAY DISCOVER WHETHER THEY ARE ARMED AGAINST
ALL ENCHANTMENTS AND OF A NOBLE BEARING ALWAYS GOOD GUARDIANS OF
THEMSELVES AND OF THE MUSIC WHICH THEY HAVE LEARNED AND RETAINING UNDER
ALL CIRCUMSTANCES A RHYTHMICAL AND HARMONIOUS NATURE SUCH AS WILL BE
MOST SERVICEABLE TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND TO THE STATE
AND HE WHO AT EVERY
AGE AS BOY AND YOUTH AND IN MATURE LIFE HAS COME OUT OF THE TRIAL
VICTORIOUS AND PURE SHALL BE APPOINTED A RULER AND GUARDIAN OF THE
STATE HE SHALL BE HONOURED IN LIFE AND DEATH AND SHALL RECEIVE
SEPULTURE AND OTHER MEMORIALS OF HONOUR THE GREATEST THAT WE HAVE TO
GIVE
BUT HIM WHO FAILS WE MUST REJECT
I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT
THIS IS THE SORT OF WAY IN WHICH OUR RULERS AND GUARDIANS SHOULD BE
CHOSEN AND APPOINTED
I SPEAK GENERALLY AND NOT WITH ANY PRETENSION TO
EXACTNESS
AND SPEAKING GENERALLY I AGREE WITH YOU HE SAID
AND PERHAPS THE WORD 'GUARDIAN' IN THE FULLEST SENSE OUGHT TO BE APPLIED
TO THIS HIGHER CLASS ONLY WHO PRESERVE US AGAINST FOREIGN ENEMIES AND
MAINTAIN PEACE AMONG OUR CITIZENS AT HOME THAT THE ONE MAY NOT HAVE THE
WILL OR THE OTHERS THE POWER TO HARM US
THE YOUNG MEN WHOM WE
BEFORE CALLED GUARDIANS MAY BE MORE PROPERLY DESIGNATED AUXILIARIES AND
SUPPORTERS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RULERS
I AGREE WITH YOU HE SAID
HOW THEN MAY WE DEVISE ONE OF THOSE NEEDFUL FALSEHOODS OF WHICH WE
LATELY SPOKE JUST ONE ROYAL LIE WHICH MAY DECEIVE THE RULERS IF THAT
BE POSSIBLE AND AT ANY RATE THE REST OF THE CITY
WHAT SORT OF LIE HE SAID
NOTHING NEW I REPLIED ONLY AN OLD PHOENICIAN TALE LAWS OF WHAT HAS
OFTEN OCCURRED BEFORE NOW IN OTHER PLACES AS THE POETS SAY AND HAVE
MADE THE WORLD BELIEVE THOUGH NOT IN OUR TIME AND I DO NOT KNOW
WHETHER SUCH AN EVENT COULD EVER HAPPEN AGAIN OR COULD NOW EVEN BE MADE
PROBABLE IF IT DID
HOW YOUR WORDS SEEM TO HESITATE ON YOUR LIPS
YOU WILL NOT WONDER I REPLIED AT MY HESITATION WHEN YOU HAVE HEARD
SPEAK HE SAID AND FEAR NOT
WELL THEN I WILL SPEAK ALTHOUGH I REALLY KNOW NOT HOW TO LOOK YOU
IN THE FACE OR IN WHAT WORDS TO UTTER THE AUDACIOUS FICTION WHICH
I PROPOSE TO COMMUNICATE GRADUALLY FIRST TO THE RULERS THEN TO THE
SOLDIERS AND LASTLY TO THE PEOPLE
THEY ARE TO BE TOLD THAT THEIR YOUTH
WAS A DREAM AND THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING WHICH THEY RECEIVED FROM
US AN APPEARANCE ONLY IN REALITY DURING ALL THAT TIME THEY WERE BEING
FORMED AND FED IN THE WOMB OF THE EARTH WHERE THEY THEMSELVES AND THEIR
ARMS AND APPURTENANCES WERE MANUFACTURED WHEN THEY WERE COMPLETED THE
EARTH THEIR MOTHER SENT THEM UP AND SO THEIR COUNTRY BEING THEIR
MOTHER AND ALSO THEIR NURSE THEY ARE BOUND TO ADVISE FOR HER GOOD AND
TO DEFEND HER AGAINST ATTACKS AND HER CITIZENS THEY ARE TO REGARD AS
CHILDREN OF THE EARTH AND THEIR OWN BROTHERS
YOU HAD GOOD REASON HE SAID TO BE ASHAMED OF THE LIE WHICH YOU WERE
GOING TO TELL
TRUE I REPLIED BUT THERE IS MORE COMING I HAVE ONLY TOLD YOU HALF
CITIZENS WE SHALL SAY TO THEM IN OUR TALE YOU ARE BROTHERS YET GOD
HAS FRAMED YOU DIFFERENTLY
SOME OF YOU HAVE THE POWER OF COMMAND AND
IN THE COMPOSITION OF THESE HE HAS MINGLED GOLD WHEREFORE ALSO
THEY HAVE THE GREATEST HONOUR OTHERS HE HAS MADE OF SILVER TO BE
AUXILIARIES OTHERS AGAIN WHO ARE TO BE HUSBANDMEN AND CRAFTSMEN HE HAS
COMPOSED OF BRASS AND IRON AND THE SPECIES WILL GENERALLY BE PRESERVED
IN THE CHILDREN
BUT AS ALL ARE OF THE SAME ORIGINAL STOCK A GOLDEN
PARENT WILL SOMETIMES HAVE A SILVER SON OR A SILVER PARENT A GOLDEN
SON
AND GOD PROCLAIMS AS A FIRST PRINCIPLE TO THE RULERS AND ABOVE ALL
ELSE THAT THERE IS NOTHING WHICH THEY SHOULD SO ANXIOUSLY GUARD OR OF
WHICH THEY ARE TO BE SUCH GOOD GUARDIANS AS OF THE PURITY OF THE RACE
THEY SHOULD OBSERVE WHAT ELEMENTS MINGLE IN THEIR OFFSPRING FOR IF THE
SON OF A GOLDEN OR SILVER PARENT HAS AN ADMIXTURE OF BRASS AND IRON
THEN NATURE ORDERS A TRANSPOSITION OF RANKS AND THE EYE OF THE RULER
MUST NOT BE PITIFUL TOWARDS THE CHILD BECAUSE HE HAS TO DESCEND IN THE
SCALE AND BECOME A HUSBANDMAN OR ARTISAN JUST AS THERE MAY BE SONS OF
ARTISANS WHO HAVING AN ADMIXTURE OF GOLD OR SILVER IN THEM ARE RAISED
TO HONOUR AND BECOME GUARDIANS OR AUXILIARIES
FOR AN ORACLE SAYS THAT
WHEN A MAN OF BRASS OR IRON GUARDS THE STATE IT WILL BE DESTROYED
SUCH
IS THE TALE IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF MAKING OUR CITIZENS BELIEVE IN
IT
NOT IN THE PRESENT GENERATION HE REPLIED THERE IS NO WAY OF
ACCOMPLISHING THIS BUT THEIR SONS MAY BE MADE TO BELIEVE IN THE TALE
AND THEIR SONS' SONS AND POSTERITY AFTER THEM
I SEE THE DIFFICULTY I REPLIED YET THE FOSTERING OF SUCH A BELIEF WILL
MAKE THEM CARE MORE FOR THE CITY AND FOR ONE ANOTHER
ENOUGH HOWEVER
OF THE FICTION WHICH MAY NOW FLY ABROAD UPON THE WINGS OF RUMOUR WHILE
WE ARM OUR EARTH BORN HEROES AND LEAD THEM FORTH UNDER THE COMMAND OF
THEIR RULERS
LET THEM LOOK ROUND AND SELECT A SPOT WHENCE THEY CAN BEST
SUPPRESS INSURRECTION IF ANY PROVE REFRACTORY WITHIN AND ALSO DEFEND
THEMSELVES AGAINST ENEMIES WHO LIKE WOLVES MAY COME DOWN ON THE FOLD
FROM WITHOUT THERE LET THEM ENCAMP AND WHEN THEY HAVE ENCAMPED LET
THEM SACRIFICE TO THE PROPER GODS AND PREPARE THEIR DWELLINGS
JUST SO HE SAID
AND THEIR DWELLINGS MUST BE SUCH AS WILL SHIELD THEM AGAINST THE COLD OF
WINTER AND THE HEAT OF SUMMER
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU MEAN HOUSES HE REPLIED
YES I SAID BUT THEY MUST BE THE HOUSES OF SOLDIERS AND NOT OF
SHOP KEEPERS
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE HE SAID
THAT I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN I REPLIED
TO KEEP WATCH DOGS WHO
FROM WANT OF DISCIPLINE OR HUNGER OR SOME EVIL HABIT OR OTHER WOULD
TURN UPON THE SHEEP AND WORRY THEM AND BEHAVE NOT LIKE DOGS BUT WOLVES
WOULD BE A FOUL AND MONSTROUS THING IN A SHEPHERD
TRULY MONSTROUS HE SAID
AND THEREFORE EVERY CARE MUST BE TAKEN THAT OUR AUXILIARIES BEING
STRONGER THAN OUR CITIZENS MAY NOT GROW TO BE TOO MUCH FOR THEM AND
BECOME SAVAGE TYRANTS INSTEAD OF FRIENDS AND ALLIES
YES GREAT CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN
AND WOULD NOT A REALLY GOOD EDUCATION FURNISH THE BEST SAFEGUARD
BUT THEY ARE WELL EDUCATED ALREADY HE REPLIED
I CANNOT BE SO CONFIDENT MY DEAR GLAUCON I SAID I AM MUCH MORE
CERTAIN THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE AND THAT TRUE EDUCATION WHATEVER THAT
MAY BE WILL HAVE THE GREATEST TENDENCY TO CIVILIZE AND HUMANIZE THEM
IN THEIR RELATIONS TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THOSE WHO ARE UNDER THEIR
PROTECTION
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
AND NOT ONLY THEIR EDUCATION BUT THEIR HABITATIONS AND ALL THAT
BELONGS TO THEM SHOULD BE SUCH AS WILL NEITHER IMPAIR THEIR VIRTUE AS
GUARDIANS NOR TEMPT THEM TO PREY UPON THE OTHER CITIZENS
ANY MAN OF
SENSE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
HE MUST
THEN NOW LET US CONSIDER WHAT WILL BE THEIR WAY OF LIFE IF THEY ARE TO
REALIZE OUR IDEA OF THEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE NONE OF THEM SHOULD HAVE
ANY PROPERTY OF HIS OWN BEYOND WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NEITHER
SHOULD THEY HAVE A PRIVATE HOUSE OR STORE CLOSED AGAINST ANY ONE WHO HAS
A MIND TO ENTER THEIR PROVISIONS SHOULD BE ONLY SUCH AS ARE REQUIRED
BY TRAINED WARRIORS WHO ARE MEN OF TEMPERANCE AND COURAGE THEY SHOULD
AGREE TO RECEIVE FROM THE CITIZENS A FIXED RATE OF PAY ENOUGH TO MEET
THE EXPENSES OF THE YEAR AND NO MORE AND THEY WILL GO TO MESS AND LIVE
TOGETHER LIKE SOLDIERS IN A CAMP
GOLD AND SILVER WE WILL TELL THEM
THAT THEY HAVE FROM GOD THE DIVINER METAL IS WITHIN THEM AND THEY HAVE
THEREFORE NO NEED OF THE DROSS WHICH IS CURRENT AMONG MEN AND OUGHT NOT
TO POLLUTE THE DIVINE BY ANY SUCH EARTHLY ADMIXTURE FOR THAT COMMONER
METAL HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MANY UNHOLY DEEDS BUT THEIR OWN IS
UNDEFILED
AND THEY ALONE OF ALL THE CITIZENS MAY NOT TOUCH OR HANDLE
SILVER OR GOLD OR BE UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH THEM OR WEAR THEM OR
DRINK FROM THEM
AND THIS WILL BE THEIR SALVATION AND THEY WILL BE THE
SAVIOURS OF THE STATE
BUT SHOULD THEY EVER ACQUIRE HOMES OR LANDS
OR MONEYS OF THEIR OWN THEY WILL BECOME HOUSEKEEPERS AND HUSBANDMEN
INSTEAD OF GUARDIANS ENEMIES AND TYRANTS INSTEAD OF ALLIES OF THE OTHER
CITIZENS HATING AND BEING HATED PLOTTING AND BEING PLOTTED AGAINST
THEY WILL PASS THEIR WHOLE LIFE IN MUCH GREATER TERROR OF INTERNAL THAN
OF EXTERNAL ENEMIES AND THE HOUR OF RUIN BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND TO THE
REST OF THE STATE WILL BE AT HAND
FOR ALL WHICH REASONS MAY WE NOT
SAY THAT THUS SHALL OUR STATE BE ORDERED AND THAT THESE SHALL BE THE
REGULATIONS APPOINTED BY US FOR GUARDIANS CONCERNING THEIR HOUSES AND
ALL OTHER MATTERS
YES SAID GLAUCON
BOOK IV
HERE ADEIMANTUS INTERPOSED A QUESTION HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER SOCRATES
SAID HE IF A PERSON WERE TO SAY THAT YOU ARE MAKING THESE PEOPLE
MISERABLE AND THAT THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THEIR OWN UNHAPPINESS THE
CITY IN FACT BELONGS TO THEM BUT THEY ARE NONE THE BETTER FOR IT
WHEREAS OTHER MEN ACQUIRE LANDS AND BUILD LARGE AND HANDSOME HOUSES
AND HAVE EVERYTHING HANDSOME ABOUT THEM OFFERING SACRIFICES TO THE GODS
ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AND PRACTISING HOSPITALITY MOREOVER AS YOU WERE
SAYING JUST NOW THEY HAVE GOLD AND SILVER AND ALL THAT IS USUAL AMONG
THE FAVOURITES OF FORTUNE BUT OUR POOR CITIZENS ARE NO BETTER THAN
MERCENARIES WHO ARE QUARTERED IN THE CITY AND ARE ALWAYS MOUNTING GUARD
YES I SAID AND YOU MAY ADD THAT THEY ARE ONLY FED AND NOT PAID IN
ADDITION TO THEIR FOOD LIKE OTHER MEN AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT IF
THEY WOULD TAKE A JOURNEY OF PLEASURE THEY HAVE NO MONEY TO SPEND ON
A MISTRESS OR ANY OTHER LUXURIOUS FANCY WHICH AS THE WORLD GOES IS
THOUGHT TO BE HAPPINESS AND MANY OTHER ACCUSATIONS OF THE SAME NATURE
MIGHT BE ADDED
BUT SAID HE LET US SUPPOSE ALL THIS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE CHARGE
YOU MEAN TO ASK I SAID WHAT WILL BE OUR ANSWER
YES
IF WE PROCEED ALONG THE OLD PATH MY BELIEF I SAID IS THAT WE SHALL
FIND THE ANSWER
AND OUR ANSWER WILL BE THAT EVEN AS THEY ARE OUR
GUARDIANS MAY VERY LIKELY BE THE HAPPIEST OF MEN BUT THAT OUR AIM IN
FOUNDING THE STATE WAS NOT THE DISPROPORTIONATE HAPPINESS OF ANY ONE
CLASS BUT THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF THE WHOLE WE THOUGHT THAT IN A
STATE WHICH IS ORDERED WITH A VIEW TO THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE WE SHOULD
BE MOST LIKELY TO FIND JUSTICE AND IN THE ILL ORDERED STATE INJUSTICE
AND HAVING FOUND THEM WE MIGHT THEN DECIDE WHICH OF THE TWO IS THE
HAPPIER
AT PRESENT I TAKE IT WE ARE FASHIONING THE HAPPY STATE
NOT PIECEMEAL OR WITH A VIEW OF MAKING A FEW HAPPY CITIZENS BUT AS A
WHOLE AND BY AND BY WE WILL PROCEED TO VIEW THE OPPOSITE KIND OF STATE
SUPPOSE THAT WE WERE PAINTING A STATUE AND SOME ONE CAME UP TO US
AND SAID WHY DO YOU NOT PUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOURS ON THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL PARTS OF THE BODY THE EYES OUGHT TO BE PURPLE BUT YOU HAVE
MADE THEM BLACK TO HIM WE MIGHT FAIRLY ANSWER SIR YOU WOULD NOT
SURELY HAVE US BEAUTIFY THE EYES TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THEY ARE NO
LONGER EYES CONSIDER RATHER WHETHER BY GIVING THIS AND THE OTHER
FEATURES THEIR DUE PROPORTION WE MAKE THE WHOLE BEAUTIFUL
AND SO I SAY
TO YOU DO NOT COMPEL US TO ASSIGN TO THE GUARDIANS A SORT OF HAPPINESS
WHICH WILL MAKE THEM ANYTHING BUT GUARDIANS FOR WE TOO CAN CLOTHE OUR
HUSBANDMEN IN ROYAL APPAREL AND SET CROWNS OF GOLD ON THEIR HEADS AND
BID THEM TILL THE GROUND AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE AND NO MORE
OUR POTTERS
ALSO MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO REPOSE ON COUCHES AND FEAST BY THE FIRESIDE
PASSING ROUND THE WINECUP WHILE THEIR WHEEL IS CONVENIENTLY AT HAND
AND WORKING AT POTTERY ONLY AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE IN THIS WAY WE MIGHT
MAKE EVERY CLASS HAPPY AND THEN AS YOU IMAGINE THE WHOLE STATE WOULD
BE HAPPY
BUT DO NOT PUT THIS IDEA INTO OUR HEADS FOR IF WE LISTEN
TO YOU THE HUSBANDMAN WILL BE NO LONGER A HUSBANDMAN THE POTTER WILL
CEASE TO BE A POTTER AND NO ONE WILL HAVE THE CHARACTER OF ANY DISTINCT
CLASS IN THE STATE
NOW THIS IS NOT OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE WHERE THE
CORRUPTION OF SOCIETY AND PRETENSION TO BE WHAT YOU ARE NOT IS
CONFINED TO COBBLERS BUT WHEN THE GUARDIANS OF THE LAWS AND OF THE
GOVERNMENT ARE ONLY SEEMING AND NOT REAL GUARDIANS THEN SEE HOW THEY
TURN THE STATE UPSIDE DOWN AND ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALONE HAVE THE
POWER OF GIVING ORDER AND HAPPINESS TO THE STATE
WE MEAN OUR GUARDIANS
TO BE TRUE SAVIOURS AND NOT THE DESTROYERS OF THE STATE WHEREAS OUR
OPPONENT IS THINKING OF PEASANTS AT A FESTIVAL WHO ARE ENJOYING A LIFE
OF REVELRY NOT OF CITIZENS WHO ARE DOING THEIR DUTY TO THE STATE
BUT
IF SO WE MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS AND HE IS SPEAKING OF SOMETHING WHICH
IS NOT A STATE
AND THEREFORE WE MUST CONSIDER WHETHER IN APPOINTING
OUR GUARDIANS WE WOULD LOOK TO THEIR GREATEST HAPPINESS INDIVIDUALLY OR
WHETHER THIS PRINCIPLE OF HAPPINESS DOES NOT RATHER RESIDE IN THE STATE
AS A WHOLE
BUT IF THE LATTER BE THE TRUTH THEN THE GUARDIANS AND
AUXILIARIES AND ALL OTHERS EQUALLY WITH THEM MUST BE COMPELLED OR
INDUCED TO DO THEIR OWN WORK IN THE BEST WAY
AND THUS THE WHOLE STATE
WILL GROW UP IN A NOBLE ORDER AND THE SEVERAL CLASSES WILL RECEIVE THE
PROPORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH NATURE ASSIGNS TO THEM
I THINK THAT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
I WONDER WHETHER YOU WILL AGREE WITH ANOTHER REMARK WHICH OCCURS TO ME
WHAT MAY THAT BE
THERE SEEM TO BE TWO CAUSES OF THE DETERIORATION OF THE ARTS
WHAT ARE THEY
WEALTH I SAID AND POVERTY
HOW DO THEY ACT
THE PROCESS IS AS FOLLOWS WHEN A POTTER BECOMES RICH WILL HE THINK
YOU ANY LONGER TAKE THE SAME PAINS WITH HIS ART
CERTAINLY NOT
HE WILL GROW MORE AND MORE INDOLENT AND CARELESS
VERY TRUE
AND THE RESULT WILL BE THAT HE BECOMES A WORSE POTTER
YES HE GREATLY DETERIORATES
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF HE HAS NO MONEY AND CANNOT PROVIDE HIMSELF
WITH TOOLS OR INSTRUMENTS HE WILL NOT WORK EQUALLY WELL HIMSELF NOR
WILL HE TEACH HIS SONS OR APPRENTICES TO WORK EQUALLY WELL
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE EITHER OF POVERTY OR OF WEALTH WORKMEN AND
THEIR WORK ARE EQUALLY LIABLE TO DEGENERATE
THAT IS EVIDENT
HERE THEN IS A DISCOVERY OF NEW EVILS I SAID AGAINST WHICH
THE GUARDIANS WILL HAVE TO WATCH OR THEY WILL CREEP INTO THE CITY
UNOBSERVED
WHAT EVILS
WEALTH I SAID AND POVERTY THE ONE IS THE PARENT OF LUXURY AND
INDOLENCE AND THE OTHER OF MEANNESS AND VICIOUSNESS AND BOTH OF
DISCONTENT
THAT IS VERY TRUE HE REPLIED BUT STILL I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
SOCRATES HOW OUR CITY WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO WAR ESPECIALLY AGAINST AN
ENEMY WHO IS RICH AND POWERFUL IF DEPRIVED OF THE SINEWS OF WAR
THERE WOULD CERTAINLY BE A DIFFICULTY I REPLIED IN GOING TO WAR WITH
ONE SUCH ENEMY BUT THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE ARE TWO OF THEM
HOW SO HE ASKED
IN THE FIRST PLACE I SAID IF WE HAVE TO FIGHT OUR SIDE WILL BE
TRAINED WARRIORS FIGHTING AGAINST AN ARMY OF RICH MEN
THAT IS TRUE HE SAID
AND DO YOU NOT SUPPOSE ADEIMANTUS THAT A SINGLE BOXER WHO WAS
PERFECT IN HIS ART WOULD EASILY BE A MATCH FOR TWO STOUT AND WELL TO DO
GENTLEMEN WHO WERE NOT BOXERS
HARDLY IF THEY CAME UPON HIM AT ONCE
WHAT NOW I SAID IF HE WERE ABLE TO RUN AWAY AND THEN TURN AND STRIKE
AT THE ONE WHO FIRST CAME UP AND SUPPOSING HE WERE TO DO THIS SEVERAL
TIMES UNDER THE HEAT OF A SCORCHING SUN MIGHT HE NOT BEING AN EXPERT
OVERTURN MORE THAN ONE STOUT PERSONAGE
CERTAINLY HE SAID THERE WOULD BE NOTHING WONDERFUL IN THAT
AND YET RICH MEN PROBABLY HAVE A GREATER SUPERIORITY IN THE SCIENCE AND
PRACTISE OF BOXING THAN THEY HAVE IN MILITARY QUALITIES
LIKELY ENOUGH
THEN WE MAY ASSUME THAT OUR ATHLETES WILL BE ABLE TO FIGHT WITH TWO OR
THREE TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER
I AGREE WITH YOU FOR I THINK YOU RIGHT
AND SUPPOSE THAT BEFORE ENGAGING OUR CITIZENS SEND AN EMBASSY TO ONE
OF THE TWO CITIES TELLING THEM WHAT IS THE TRUTH SILVER AND GOLD WE
NEITHER HAVE NOR ARE PERMITTED TO HAVE BUT YOU MAY DO YOU THEREFORE
COME AND HELP US IN WAR AND TAKE THE SPOILS OF THE OTHER CITY WHO
ON HEARING THESE WORDS WOULD CHOOSE TO FIGHT AGAINST LEAN WIRY DOGS
RATHER THAN WITH THE DOGS ON THEIR SIDE AGAINST FAT AND TENDER SHEEP
THAT IS NOT LIKELY AND YET THERE MIGHT BE A DANGER TO THE POOR STATE IF
THE WEALTH OF MANY STATES WERE TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE
BUT HOW SIMPLE OF YOU TO USE THE TERM STATE AT ALL OF ANY BUT OUR OWN
WHY SO
YOU OUGHT TO SPEAK OF OTHER STATES IN THE PLURAL NUMBER NOT ONE OF
THEM IS A CITY BUT MANY CITIES AS THEY SAY IN THE GAME
FOR INDEED ANY
CITY HOWEVER SMALL IS IN FACT DIVIDED INTO TWO ONE THE CITY OF THE
POOR THE OTHER OF THE RICH THESE ARE AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND IN
EITHER THERE ARE MANY SMALLER DIVISIONS AND YOU WOULD BE ALTOGETHER
BESIDE THE MARK IF YOU TREATED THEM ALL AS A SINGLE STATE
BUT IF YOU
DEAL WITH THEM AS MANY AND GIVE THE WEALTH OR POWER OR PERSONS OF THE
ONE TO THE OTHERS YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A GREAT MANY FRIENDS AND NOT
MANY ENEMIES
AND YOUR STATE WHILE THE WISE ORDER WHICH HAS NOW BEEN
PRESCRIBED CONTINUES TO PREVAIL IN HER WILL BE THE GREATEST OF STATES
I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY IN REPUTATION OR APPEARANCE BUT IN DEED AND TRUTH
THOUGH SHE NUMBER NOT MORE THAN A THOUSAND DEFENDERS
A SINGLE STATE
WHICH IS HER EQUAL YOU WILL HARDLY FIND EITHER AMONG HELLENES OR
BARBARIANS THOUGH MANY THAT APPEAR TO BE AS GREAT AND MANY TIMES
GREATER
THAT IS MOST TRUE HE SAID
AND WHAT I SAID WILL BE THE BEST LIMIT FOR OUR RULERS TO FIX WHEN THEY
ARE CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE STATE AND THE AMOUNT OF TERRITORY WHICH
THEY ARE TO INCLUDE AND BEYOND WHICH THEY WILL NOT GO
WHAT LIMIT WOULD YOU PROPOSE
I WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO INCREASE SO FAR AS IS CONSISTENT WITH UNITY
THAT I THINK IS THE PROPER LIMIT
VERY GOOD HE SAID
HERE THEN I SAID IS ANOTHER ORDER WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE CONVEYED TO
OUR GUARDIANS LET OUR CITY BE ACCOUNTED NEITHER LARGE NOR SMALL BUT
ONE AND SELF SUFFICING
AND SURELY SAID HE THIS IS NOT A VERY SEVERE ORDER WHICH WE IMPOSE
UPON THEM
AND THE OTHER SAID I OF WHICH WE WERE SPEAKING BEFORE IS LIGHTER
STILL I MEAN THE DUTY OF DEGRADING THE OFFSPRING OF THE GUARDIANS WHEN
INFERIOR AND OF ELEVATING INTO THE RANK OF GUARDIANS THE OFFSPRING OF
THE LOWER CLASSES WHEN NATURALLY SUPERIOR
THE INTENTION WAS THAT IN
THE CASE OF THE CITIZENS GENERALLY EACH INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE PUT TO THE
USE FOR WHICH NATURE INTENDED HIM ONE TO ONE WORK AND THEN EVERY MAN
WOULD DO HIS OWN BUSINESS AND BE ONE AND NOT MANY AND SO THE WHOLE
CITY WOULD BE ONE AND NOT MANY
YES HE SAID THAT IS NOT SO DIFFICULT
THE REGULATIONS WHICH WE ARE PRESCRIBING MY GOOD ADEIMANTUS ARE NOT
AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED A NUMBER OF GREAT PRINCIPLES BUT TRIFLES ALL
IF CARE BE TAKEN AS THE SAYING IS OF THE ONE GREAT THING A THING
HOWEVER WHICH I WOULD RATHER CALL NOT GREAT BUT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR
PURPOSE
WHAT MAY THAT BE HE ASKED
EDUCATION I SAID AND NURTURE IF OUR CITIZENS ARE WELL EDUCATED
AND GROW INTO SENSIBLE MEN THEY WILL EASILY SEE THEIR WAY THROUGH ALL
THESE AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS WHICH I OMIT SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS
MARRIAGE THE POSSESSION OF WOMEN AND THE PROCREATION OF CHILDREN WHICH
WILL ALL FOLLOW THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT FRIENDS HAVE ALL THINGS IN
COMMON AS THE PROVERB SAYS
THAT WILL BE THE BEST WAY OF SETTLING THEM
ALSO I SAID THE STATE IF ONCE STARTED WELL MOVES WITH ACCUMULATING
FORCE LIKE A WHEEL
FOR GOOD NURTURE AND EDUCATION IMPLANT GOOD
CONSTITUTIONS AND THESE GOOD CONSTITUTIONS TAKING ROOT IN A GOOD
EDUCATION IMPROVE MORE AND MORE AND THIS IMPROVEMENT AFFECTS THE BREED
IN MAN AS IN OTHER ANIMALS
VERY POSSIBLY HE SAID
THEN TO SUM UP THIS IS THE POINT TO WHICH ABOVE ALL THE ATTENTION OF
OUR RULERS SHOULD BE DIRECTED THAT MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC BE PRESERVED IN
THEIR ORIGINAL FORM AND NO INNOVATION MADE
THEY MUST DO THEIR UTMOST
TO MAINTAIN THEM INTACT
AND WHEN ANY ONE SAYS THAT MANKIND MOST REGARD
'THE NEWEST SONG WHICH THE SINGERS HAVE
THEY WILL BE AFRAID THAT HE MAY BE PRAISING NOT NEW SONGS BUT A NEW
KIND OF SONG AND THIS OUGHT NOT TO BE PRAISED OR CONCEIVED TO BE THE
MEANING OF THE POET FOR ANY MUSICAL INNOVATION IS FULL OF DANGER TO THE
WHOLE STATE AND OUGHT TO BE PROHIBITED
SO DAMON TELLS ME AND I
CAN QUITE BELIEVE HIM HE SAYS THAT WHEN MODES OF MUSIC CHANGE THE
FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE STATE ALWAYS CHANGE WITH THEM
YES SAID ADEIMANTUS AND YOU MAY ADD MY SUFFRAGE TO DAMON'S AND YOUR
OWN
THEN I SAID OUR GUARDIANS MUST LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR FORTRESS
IN MUSIC
YES HE SAID THE LAWLESSNESS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK TOO EASILY STEALS IN
YES I REPLIED IN THE FORM OF AMUSEMENT AND AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARS
HARMLESS
WHY YES HE SAID AND THERE IS NO HARM WERE IT NOT THAT LITTLE BY
LITTLE THIS SPIRIT OF LICENCE FINDING A HOME IMPERCEPTIBLY PENETRATES
INTO MANNERS AND CUSTOMS WHENCE ISSUING WITH GREATER FORCE IT INVADES
CONTRACTS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN AND FROM CONTRACTS GOES ON TO LAWS AND
CONSTITUTIONS IN UTTER RECKLESSNESS ENDING AT LAST SOCRATES BY AN
OVERTHROW OF ALL RIGHTS PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC
IS THAT TRUE I SAID
THAT IS MY BELIEF HE REPLIED
THEN AS I WAS SAYING OUR YOUTH SHOULD BE TRAINED FROM THE FIRST IN
A STRICTER SYSTEM FOR IF AMUSEMENTS BECOME LAWLESS AND THE YOUTHS
THEMSELVES BECOME LAWLESS THEY CAN NEVER GROW UP INTO WELL CONDUCTED
AND VIRTUOUS CITIZENS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND WHEN THEY HAVE MADE A GOOD BEGINNING IN PLAY AND BY THE HELP OF
MUSIC HAVE GAINED THE HABIT OF GOOD ORDER THEN THIS HABIT OF ORDER IN
A MANNER HOW UNLIKE THE LAWLESS PLAY OF THE OTHERS WILL ACCOMPANY THEM
IN ALL THEIR ACTIONS AND BE A PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH TO THEM AND IF THERE
BE ANY FALLEN PLACES IN THE STATE WILL RAISE THEM UP AGAIN
VERY TRUE HE SAID
THUS EDUCATED THEY WILL INVENT FOR THEMSELVES ANY LESSER RULES WHICH
THEIR PREDECESSORS HAVE ALTOGETHER NEGLECTED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN SUCH THINGS AS THESE WHEN THE YOUNG ARE TO BE SILENT BEFORE
THEIR ELDERS HOW THEY ARE TO SHOW RESPECT TO THEM BY STANDING AND
MAKING THEM SIT WHAT HONOUR IS DUE TO PARENTS WHAT GARMENTS OR SHOES
ARE TO BE WORN THE MODE OF DRESSING THE HAIR DEPORTMENT AND MANNERS IN
GENERAL
YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME
YES
BUT THERE IS I THINK SMALL WISDOM IN LEGISLATING ABOUT SUCH
MATTERS I DOUBT IF IT IS EVER DONE NOR ARE ANY PRECISE WRITTEN
ENACTMENTS ABOUT THEM LIKELY TO BE LASTING
IMPOSSIBLE
IT WOULD SEEM ADEIMANTUS THAT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH EDUCATION STARTS
A MAN WILL DETERMINE HIS FUTURE LIFE
DOES NOT LIKE ALWAYS ATTRACT
LIKE
TO BE SURE
UNTIL SOME ONE RARE AND GRAND RESULT IS REACHED WHICH MAY BE GOOD AND
MAY BE THE REVERSE OF GOOD
THAT IS NOT TO BE DENIED
AND FOR THIS REASON I SAID I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO LEGISLATE FURTHER
ABOUT THEM
NATURALLY ENOUGH HE REPLIED
WELL AND ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF THE AGORA AND THE ORDINARY DEALINGS
BETWEEN MAN AND MAN OR AGAIN ABOUT AGREEMENTS WITH ARTISANS ABOUT
INSULT AND INJURY OR THE COMMENCEMENT OF ACTIONS AND THE APPOINTMENT
OF JURIES WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THERE MAY ALSO ARISE QUESTIONS ABOUT
ANY IMPOSITIONS AND EXACTIONS OF MARKET AND HARBOUR DUES WHICH MAY
BE REQUIRED AND IN GENERAL ABOUT THE REGULATIONS OF MARKETS POLICE
HARBOURS AND THE LIKE
BUT OH HEAVENS SHALL WE CONDESCEND TO
LEGISLATE ON ANY OF THESE PARTICULARS
I THINK HE SAID THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO IMPOSE LAWS ABOUT THEM ON
GOOD MEN WHAT REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY THEY WILL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH
FOR THEMSELVES
YES I SAID MY FRIEND IF GOD WILL ONLY PRESERVE TO THEM THE LAWS WHICH
WE HAVE GIVEN THEM
AND WITHOUT DIVINE HELP SAID ADEIMANTUS THEY WILL GO ON FOR EVER
MAKING AND MENDING THEIR LAWS AND THEIR LIVES IN THE HOPE OF ATTAINING
PERFECTION
YOU WOULD COMPARE THEM I SAID TO THOSE INVALIDS WHO HAVING NO
SELF RESTRAINT WILL NOT LEAVE OFF THEIR HABITS OF INTEMPERANCE
EXACTLY
YES I SAID AND WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIFE THEY LEAD THEY ARE ALWAYS
DOCTORING AND INCREASING AND COMPLICATING THEIR DISORDERS AND ALWAYS
FANCYING THAT THEY WILL BE CURED BY ANY NOSTRUM WHICH ANYBODY ADVISES
THEM TO TRY
SUCH CASES ARE VERY COMMON HE SAID WITH INVALIDS OF THIS SORT
YES I REPLIED AND THE CHARMING THING IS THAT THEY DEEM HIM THEIR WORST
ENEMY WHO TELLS THEM THE TRUTH WHICH IS SIMPLY THAT UNLESS THEY GIVE
UP EATING AND DRINKING AND WENCHING AND IDLING NEITHER DRUG NOR CAUTERY
NOR SPELL NOR AMULET NOR ANY OTHER REMEDY WILL AVAIL
CHARMING HE REPLIED
I SEE NOTHING CHARMING IN GOING INTO A PASSION
WITH A MAN WHO TELLS YOU WHAT IS RIGHT
THESE GENTLEMEN I SAID DO NOT SEEM TO BE IN YOUR GOOD GRACES
ASSUREDLY NOT
NOR WOULD YOU PRAISE THE BEHAVIOUR OF STATES WHICH ACT LIKE THE MEN WHOM
I WAS JUST NOW DESCRIBING
FOR ARE THERE NOT ILL ORDERED STATES IN
WHICH THE CITIZENS ARE FORBIDDEN UNDER PAIN OF DEATH TO ALTER THE
CONSTITUTION AND YET HE WHO MOST SWEETLY COURTS THOSE WHO LIVE UNDER
THIS REGIME AND INDULGES THEM AND FAWNS UPON THEM AND IS SKILFUL IN
ANTICIPATING AND GRATIFYING THEIR HUMOURS IS HELD TO BE A GREAT AND
GOOD STATESMAN DO NOT THESE STATES RESEMBLE THE PERSONS WHOM I WAS
DESCRIBING
YES HE SAID THE STATES ARE AS BAD AS THE MEN AND I AM VERY FAR FROM
PRAISING THEM
BUT DO YOU NOT ADMIRE I SAID THE COOLNESS AND DEXTERITY OF THESE READY
MINISTERS OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION
YES HE SAID I DO BUT NOT OF ALL OF THEM FOR THERE ARE SOME WHOM
THE APPLAUSE OF THE MULTITUDE HAS DELUDED INTO THE BELIEF THAT THEY ARE
REALLY STATESMEN AND THESE ARE NOT MUCH TO BE ADMIRED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SAID YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE FEELING FOR THEM
WHEN A
MAN CANNOT MEASURE AND A GREAT MANY OTHERS WHO CANNOT MEASURE DECLARE
THAT HE IS FOUR CUBITS HIGH CAN HE HELP BELIEVING WHAT THEY SAY
NAY HE SAID CERTAINLY NOT IN THAT CASE
WELL THEN DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH THEM FOR ARE THEY NOT AS GOOD AS A
PLAY TRYING THEIR HAND AT PALTRY REFORMS SUCH AS I WAS DESCRIBING THEY
ARE ALWAYS FANCYING THAT BY LEGISLATION THEY WILL MAKE AN END OF FRAUDS
IN CONTRACTS AND THE OTHER RASCALITIES WHICH I WAS MENTIONING NOT
KNOWING THAT THEY ARE IN REALITY CUTTING OFF THE HEADS OF A HYDRA
YES HE SAID THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY ARE DOING
I CONCEIVE I SAID THAT THE TRUE LEGISLATOR WILL NOT TROUBLE
HIMSELF WITH THIS CLASS OF ENACTMENTS WHETHER CONCERNING LAWS OR THE
CONSTITUTION EITHER IN AN ILL ORDERED OR IN A WELL ORDERED STATE FOR
IN THE FORMER THEY ARE QUITE USELESS AND IN THE LATTER THERE WILL BE NO
DIFFICULTY IN DEVISING THEM AND MANY OF THEM WILL NATURALLY FLOW OUT OF
OUR PREVIOUS REGULATIONS
WHAT THEN HE SAID IS STILL REMAINING TO US OF THE WORK OF
LEGISLATION
NOTHING TO US I REPLIED BUT TO APOLLO THE GOD OF DELPHI THERE
REMAINS THE ORDERING OF THE GREATEST AND NOBLEST AND CHIEFEST THINGS OF
ALL
WHICH ARE THEY HE SAID
THE INSTITUTION OF TEMPLES AND SACRIFICES AND THE ENTIRE SERVICE OF
GODS DEMIGODS AND HEROES ALSO THE ORDERING OF THE REPOSITORIES OF
THE DEAD AND THE RITES WHICH HAVE TO BE OBSERVED BY HIM WHO WOULD
PROPITIATE THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD BELOW
THESE ARE MATTERS OF
WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT OURSELVES AND AS FOUNDERS OF A CITY WE SHOULD BE
UNWISE IN TRUSTING THEM TO ANY INTERPRETER BUT OUR ANCESTRAL DEITY
HE
IS THE GOD WHO SITS IN THE CENTRE ON THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH AND HE IS
THE INTERPRETER OF RELIGION TO ALL MANKIND
YOU ARE RIGHT AND WE WILL DO AS YOU PROPOSE
BUT WHERE AMID ALL THIS IS JUSTICE SON OF ARISTON TELL ME WHERE
NOW
THAT OUR CITY HAS BEEN MADE HABITABLE LIGHT A CANDLE AND SEARCH AND
GET YOUR BROTHER AND POLEMARCHUS AND THE REST OF OUR FRIENDS TO HELP
AND LET US SEE WHERE IN IT WE CAN DISCOVER JUSTICE AND WHERE INJUSTICE
AND IN WHAT THEY DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WHICH OF THEM THE MAN WHO
WOULD BE HAPPY SHOULD HAVE FOR HIS PORTION WHETHER SEEN OR UNSEEN BY
GODS AND MEN
NONSENSE SAID GLAUCON DID YOU NOT PROMISE TO SEARCH YOURSELF SAYING
THAT FOR YOU NOT TO HELP JUSTICE IN HER NEED WOULD BE AN IMPIETY
I DO NOT DENY THAT I SAID SO AND AS YOU REMIND ME I WILL BE AS GOOD AS
MY WORD BUT YOU MUST JOIN
WE WILL HE REPLIED
WELL THEN I HOPE TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY IN THIS WAY I MEAN TO BEGIN
WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT OUR STATE IF RIGHTLY ORDERED IS PERFECT
THAT IS MOST CERTAIN
AND BEING PERFECT IS THEREFORE WISE AND VALIANT AND TEMPERATE AND JUST
THAT IS LIKEWISE CLEAR
AND WHICHEVER OF THESE QUALITIES WE FIND IN THE STATE THE ONE WHICH IS
NOT FOUND WILL BE THE RESIDUE
VERY GOOD
IF THERE WERE FOUR THINGS AND WE WERE SEARCHING FOR ONE OF THEM
WHEREVER IT MIGHT BE THE ONE SOUGHT FOR MIGHT BE KNOWN TO US FROM THE
FIRST AND THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER TROUBLE OR WE MIGHT KNOW THE OTHER
THREE FIRST AND THEN THE FOURTH WOULD CLEARLY BE THE ONE LEFT
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND IS NOT A SIMILAR METHOD TO BE PURSUED ABOUT THE VIRTUES WHICH ARE
ALSO FOUR IN NUMBER
CLEARLY
FIRST AMONG THE VIRTUES FOUND IN THE STATE WISDOM COMES INTO VIEW AND
IN THIS I DETECT A CERTAIN PECULIARITY
WHAT IS THAT
THE STATE WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING IS SAID TO BE WISE AS BEING GOOD
IN COUNSEL
VERY TRUE
AND GOOD COUNSEL IS CLEARLY A KIND OF KNOWLEDGE FOR NOT BY IGNORANCE
BUT BY KNOWLEDGE DO MEN COUNSEL WELL
CLEARLY
AND THE KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN A STATE ARE MANY AND DIVERSE
OF COURSE
THERE IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CARPENTER BUT IS THAT THE SORT OF
KNOWLEDGE WHICH GIVES A CITY THE TITLE OF WISE AND GOOD IN COUNSEL
CERTAINLY NOT THAT WOULD ONLY GIVE A CITY THE REPUTATION OF SKILL IN
CARPENTERING
THEN A CITY IS NOT TO BE CALLED WISE BECAUSE POSSESSING A KNOWLEDGE
WHICH COUNSELS FOR THE BEST ABOUT WOODEN IMPLEMENTS
CERTAINLY NOT
NOR BY REASON OF A KNOWLEDGE WHICH ADVISES ABOUT BRAZEN POTS I SAID
NOR AS POSSESSING ANY OTHER SIMILAR KNOWLEDGE
NOT BY REASON OF ANY OF THEM HE SAID
NOR YET BY REASON OF A KNOWLEDGE WHICH CULTIVATES THE EARTH THAT WOULD
GIVE THE CITY THE NAME OF AGRICULTURAL
YES
WELL I SAID AND IS THERE ANY KNOWLEDGE IN OUR RECENTLY FOUNDED STATE
AMONG ANY OF THE CITIZENS WHICH ADVISES NOT ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR THING
IN THE STATE BUT ABOUT THE WHOLE AND CONSIDERS HOW A STATE CAN BEST
DEAL WITH ITSELF AND WITH OTHER STATES
THERE CERTAINLY IS
AND WHAT IS THIS KNOWLEDGE AND AMONG WHOM IS IT FOUND I ASKED
IT IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GUARDIANS HE REPLIED AND IS FOUND AMONG
THOSE WHOM WE WERE JUST NOW DESCRIBING AS PERFECT GUARDIANS
AND WHAT IS THE NAME WHICH THE CITY DERIVES FROM THE POSSESSION OF THIS
SORT OF KNOWLEDGE
THE NAME OF GOOD IN COUNSEL AND TRULY WISE
AND WILL THERE BE IN OUR CITY MORE OF THESE TRUE GUARDIANS OR MORE
SMITHS
THE SMITHS HE REPLIED WILL BE FAR MORE NUMEROUS
WILL NOT THE GUARDIANS BE THE SMALLEST OF ALL THE CLASSES WHO RECEIVE A
NAME FROM THE PROFESSION OF SOME KIND OF KNOWLEDGE
MUCH THE SMALLEST
AND SO BY REASON OF THE SMALLEST PART OR CLASS AND OF THE KNOWLEDGE
WHICH RESIDES IN THIS PRESIDING AND RULING PART OF ITSELF THE WHOLE
STATE BEING THUS CONSTITUTED ACCORDING TO NATURE WILL BE WISE AND
THIS WHICH HAS THE ONLY KNOWLEDGE WORTHY TO BE CALLED WISDOM HAS BEEN
ORDAINED BY NATURE TO BE OF ALL CLASSES THE LEAST
MOST TRUE
THUS THEN I SAID THE NATURE AND PLACE IN THE STATE OF ONE OF THE FOUR
VIRTUES HAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER BEEN DISCOVERED
AND IN MY HUMBLE OPINION VERY SATISFACTORILY DISCOVERED HE REPLIED
AGAIN I SAID THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN SEEING THE NATURE OF COURAGE
AND IN WHAT PART THAT QUALITY RESIDES WHICH GIVES THE NAME OF COURAGEOUS
TO THE STATE
HOW DO YOU MEAN
WHY I SAID EVERY ONE WHO CALLS ANY STATE COURAGEOUS OR COWARDLY WILL
BE THINKING OF THE PART WHICH FIGHTS AND GOES OUT TO WAR ON THE STATE'S
BEHALF
NO ONE HE REPLIED WOULD EVER THINK OF ANY OTHER
THE REST OF THE CITIZENS MAY BE COURAGEOUS OR MAY BE COWARDLY BUT THEIR
COURAGE OR COWARDICE WILL NOT AS I CONCEIVE HAVE THE EFFECT OF MAKING
THE CITY EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER
CERTAINLY NOT
THE CITY WILL BE COURAGEOUS IN VIRTUE OF A PORTION OF HERSELF WHICH
PRESERVES UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OPINION ABOUT THE NATURE OF
THINGS TO BE FEARED AND NOT TO BE FEARED IN WHICH OUR LEGISLATOR
EDUCATED THEM AND THIS IS WHAT YOU TERM COURAGE
I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ONCE MORE FOR I DO NOT THINK
THAT I PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND YOU
I MEAN THAT COURAGE IS A KIND OF SALVATION
SALVATION OF WHAT
OF THE OPINION RESPECTING THINGS TO BE FEARED WHAT THEY ARE AND OF
WHAT NATURE WHICH THE LAW IMPLANTS THROUGH EDUCATION AND I MEAN BY THE
WORDS 'UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES' TO INTIMATE THAT IN PLEASURE OR IN PAIN
OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DESIRE OR FEAR A MAN PRESERVES AND DOES NOT
LOSE THIS OPINION
SHALL I GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION
IF YOU PLEASE
YOU KNOW I SAID THAT DYERS WHEN THEY WANT TO DYE WOOL FOR MAKING THE
TRUE SEA PURPLE BEGIN BY SELECTING THEIR WHITE COLOUR FIRST THIS THEY
PREPARE AND DRESS WITH MUCH CARE AND PAINS IN ORDER THAT THE WHITE
GROUND MAY TAKE THE PURPLE HUE IN FULL PERFECTION
THE DYEING THEN
PROCEEDS AND WHATEVER IS DYED IN THIS MANNER BECOMES A FAST COLOUR
AND NO WASHING EITHER WITH LYES OR WITHOUT THEM CAN TAKE AWAY THE BLOOM
BUT WHEN THE GROUND HAS NOT BEEN DULY PREPARED YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED
HOW POOR IS THE LOOK EITHER OF PURPLE OR OF ANY OTHER COLOUR
YES HE SAID I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A WASHED OUT AND RIDICULOUS
APPEARANCE
THEN NOW I SAID YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR OBJECT WAS IN SELECTING
OUR SOLDIERS AND EDUCATING THEM IN MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC WE WERE
CONTRIVING INFLUENCES WHICH WOULD PREPARE THEM TO TAKE THE DYE OF THE
LAWS IN PERFECTION AND THE COLOUR OF THEIR OPINION ABOUT DANGERS AND
OF EVERY OTHER OPINION WAS TO BE INDELIBLY FIXED BY THEIR NURTURE
AND TRAINING NOT TO BE WASHED AWAY BY SUCH POTENT LYES AS
PLEASURE MIGHTIER AGENT FAR IN WASHING THE SOUL THAN ANY SODA OR LYE
OR BY SORROW FEAR AND DESIRE THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL OTHER SOLVENTS
AND
THIS SORT OF UNIVERSAL SAVING POWER OF TRUE OPINION IN CONFORMITY WITH
LAW ABOUT REAL AND FALSE DANGERS I CALL AND MAINTAIN TO BE COURAGE
UNLESS YOU DISAGREE
BUT I AGREE HE REPLIED FOR I SUPPOSE THAT YOU MEAN TO EXCLUDE MERE
UNINSTRUCTED COURAGE SUCH AS THAT OF A WILD BEAST OR OF A SLAVE THIS
IN YOUR OPINION IS NOT THE COURAGE WHICH THE LAW ORDAINS AND OUGHT TO
HAVE ANOTHER NAME
MOST CERTAINLY
THEN I MAY INFER COURAGE TO BE SUCH AS YOU DESCRIBE
WHY YES SAID I YOU MAY AND IF YOU ADD THE WORDS 'OF A CITIZEN
YOU WILL NOT BE FAR WRONG HEREAFTER IF YOU LIKE WE WILL CARRY THE
EXAMINATION FURTHER BUT AT PRESENT WE ARE SEEKING NOT FOR COURAGE BUT
JUSTICE AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR ENQUIRY WE HAVE SAID ENOUGH
YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED
TWO VIRTUES REMAIN TO BE DISCOVERED IN THE STATE FIRST TEMPERANCE AND
THEN JUSTICE WHICH IS THE END OF OUR SEARCH
VERY TRUE
NOW CAN WE FIND JUSTICE WITHOUT TROUBLING OURSELVES ABOUT TEMPERANCE
I DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED HE SAID NOR DO I DESIRE
THAT JUSTICE SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND TEMPERANCE LOST SIGHT OF
AND THEREFORE I WISH THAT YOU WOULD DO ME THE FAVOUR OF CONSIDERING
TEMPERANCE FIRST
CERTAINLY I REPLIED I SHOULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN REFUSING YOUR
REQUEST
THEN CONSIDER HE SAID
YES I REPLIED I WILL AND AS FAR AS I CAN AT PRESENT SEE THE VIRTUE
OF TEMPERANCE HAS MORE OF THE NATURE OF HARMONY AND SYMPHONY THAN THE
PRECEDING
HOW SO HE ASKED
TEMPERANCE I REPLIED IS THE ORDERING OR CONTROLLING OF CERTAIN
PLEASURES AND DESIRES THIS IS CURIOUSLY ENOUGH IMPLIED IN THE SAYING OF
'A MAN BEING HIS OWN MASTER AND OTHER TRACES OF THE SAME NOTION MAY BE
FOUND IN LANGUAGE
NO DOUBT HE SAID
THERE IS SOMETHING RIDICULOUS IN THE EXPRESSION 'MASTER OF HIMSELF FOR
THE MASTER IS ALSO THE SERVANT AND THE SERVANT THE MASTER AND IN ALL
THESE MODES OF SPEAKING THE SAME PERSON IS DENOTED
CERTAINLY
THE MEANING IS I BELIEVE THAT IN THE HUMAN SOUL THERE IS A BETTER AND
ALSO A WORSE PRINCIPLE AND WHEN THE BETTER HAS THE WORSE UNDER CONTROL
THEN A MAN IS SAID TO BE MASTER OF HIMSELF AND THIS IS A TERM OF
PRAISE BUT WHEN OWING TO EVIL EDUCATION OR ASSOCIATION THE BETTER
PRINCIPLE WHICH IS ALSO THE SMALLER IS OVERWHELMED BY THE GREATER MASS
OF THE WORSE IN THIS CASE HE IS BLAMED AND IS CALLED THE SLAVE OF SELF
AND UNPRINCIPLED
YES THERE IS REASON IN THAT
AND NOW I SAID LOOK AT OUR NEWLY CREATED STATE AND THERE YOU WILL
FIND ONE OF THESE TWO CONDITIONS REALIZED FOR THE STATE AS YOU
WILL ACKNOWLEDGE MAY BE JUSTLY CALLED MASTER OF ITSELF IF THE WORDS
'TEMPERANCE' AND 'SELF MASTERY' TRULY EXPRESS THE RULE OF THE BETTER
PART OVER THE WORSE
YES HE SAID I SEE THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE
LET ME FURTHER NOTE THAT THE MANIFOLD AND COMPLEX PLEASURES AND DESIRES
AND PAINS ARE GENERALLY FOUND IN CHILDREN AND WOMEN AND SERVANTS AND IN
THE FREEMEN SO CALLED WHO ARE OF THE LOWEST AND MORE NUMEROUS CLASS
CERTAINLY HE SAID
WHEREAS THE SIMPLE AND MODERATE DESIRES WHICH FOLLOW REASON AND ARE
UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF MIND AND TRUE OPINION ARE TO BE FOUND ONLY IN A
FEW AND THOSE THE BEST BORN AND BEST EDUCATED
VERY TRUE
THESE TWO AS YOU MAY PERCEIVE HAVE A PLACE IN OUR STATE AND THE
MEANER DESIRES OF THE MANY ARE HELD DOWN BY THE VIRTUOUS DESIRES AND
WISDOM OF THE FEW
THAT I PERCEIVE HE SAID
THEN IF THERE BE ANY CITY WHICH MAY BE DESCRIBED AS MASTER OF ITS OWN
PLEASURES AND DESIRES AND MASTER OF ITSELF OURS MAY CLAIM SUCH A
DESIGNATION
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
IT MAY ALSO BE CALLED TEMPERATE AND FOR THE SAME REASONS
YES
AND IF THERE BE ANY STATE IN WHICH RULERS AND SUBJECTS WILL BE AGREED AS
TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE TO RULE THAT AGAIN WILL BE OUR STATE
UNDOUBTEDLY
AND THE CITIZENS BEING THUS AGREED AMONG THEMSELVES IN WHICH CLASS WILL
TEMPERANCE BE FOUND IN THE RULERS OR IN THE SUBJECTS
IN BOTH AS I SHOULD IMAGINE HE REPLIED
DO YOU OBSERVE THAT WE WERE NOT FAR WRONG IN OUR GUESS THAT TEMPERANCE
WAS A SORT OF HARMONY
WHY SO
WHY BECAUSE TEMPERANCE IS UNLIKE COURAGE AND WISDOM EACH OF WHICH
RESIDES IN A PART ONLY THE ONE MAKING THE STATE WISE AND THE OTHER
VALIANT NOT SO TEMPERANCE WHICH EXTENDS TO THE WHOLE AND RUNS THROUGH
ALL THE NOTES OF THE SCALE AND PRODUCES A HARMONY OF THE WEAKER AND THE
STRONGER AND THE MIDDLE CLASS WHETHER YOU SUPPOSE THEM TO BE STRONGER
OR WEAKER IN WISDOM OR POWER OR NUMBERS OR WEALTH OR ANYTHING ELSE
MOST TRULY THEN MAY WE DEEM TEMPERANCE TO BE THE AGREEMENT OF THE
NATURALLY SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR AS TO THE RIGHT TO RULE OF EITHER BOTH
IN STATES AND INDIVIDUALS
I ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOU
AND SO I SAID WE MAY CONSIDER THREE OUT OF THE FOUR VIRTUES TO HAVE
BEEN DISCOVERED IN OUR STATE
THE LAST OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH MAKE A
STATE VIRTUOUS MUST BE JUSTICE IF WE ONLY KNEW WHAT THAT WAS
THE INFERENCE IS OBVIOUS
THE TIME THEN HAS ARRIVED GLAUCON WHEN LIKE HUNTSMEN WE SHOULD
SURROUND THE COVER AND LOOK SHARP THAT JUSTICE DOES NOT STEAL AWAY AND
PASS OUT OF SIGHT AND ESCAPE US FOR BEYOND A DOUBT SHE IS SOMEWHERE IN
THIS COUNTRY WATCH THEREFORE AND STRIVE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF HER AND IF
YOU SEE HER FIRST LET ME KNOW
WOULD THAT I COULD BUT YOU SHOULD REGARD ME RATHER AS A FOLLOWER WHO
HAS JUST EYES ENOUGH TO SEE WHAT YOU SHOW HIM THAT IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS
I AM GOOD FOR
OFFER UP A PRAYER WITH ME AND FOLLOW
I WILL BUT YOU MUST SHOW ME THE WAY
HERE IS NO PATH I SAID AND THE WOOD IS DARK AND PERPLEXING STILL WE
MUST PUSH ON
LET US PUSH ON
HERE I SAW SOMETHING HALLOO I SAID I BEGIN TO PERCEIVE A TRACK AND I
BELIEVE THAT THE QUARRY WILL NOT ESCAPE
GOOD NEWS HE SAID
TRULY I SAID WE ARE STUPID FELLOWS
WHY SO
WHY MY GOOD SIR AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR ENQUIRY AGES AGO THERE WAS
JUSTICE TUMBLING OUT AT OUR FEET AND WE NEVER SAW HER NOTHING COULD BE
MORE RIDICULOUS
LIKE PEOPLE WHO GO ABOUT LOOKING FOR WHAT THEY HAVE
IN THEIR HANDS THAT WAS THE WAY WITH US WE LOOKED NOT AT WHAT WE
WERE SEEKING BUT AT WHAT WAS FAR OFF IN THE DISTANCE AND THEREFORE I
SUPPOSE WE MISSED HER
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN TO SAY THAT IN REALITY FOR A LONG TIME PAST WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
OF JUSTICE AND HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNISE HER
I GROW IMPATIENT AT THE LENGTH OF YOUR EXORDIUM
WELL THEN TELL ME I SAID WHETHER I AM RIGHT OR NOT YOU REMEMBER THE
ORIGINAL PRINCIPLE WHICH WE WERE ALWAYS LAYING DOWN AT THE FOUNDATION
OF THE STATE THAT ONE MAN SHOULD PRACTISE ONE THING ONLY THE THING TO
WHICH HIS NATURE WAS BEST ADAPTED NOW JUSTICE IS THIS PRINCIPLE OR A
PART OF IT
YES WE OFTEN SAID THAT ONE MAN SHOULD DO ONE THING ONLY
FURTHER WE AFFIRMED THAT JUSTICE WAS DOING ONE'S OWN BUSINESS AND NOT
BEING A BUSYBODY WE SAID SO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND MANY OTHERS HAVE SAID
THE SAME TO US
YES WE SAID SO
THEN TO DO ONE'S OWN BUSINESS IN A CERTAIN WAY MAY BE ASSUMED TO BE
JUSTICE
CAN YOU TELL ME WHENCE I DERIVE THIS INFERENCE
I CANNOT BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TOLD
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS THE ONLY VIRTUE WHICH REMAINS IN THE
STATE WHEN THE OTHER VIRTUES OF TEMPERANCE AND COURAGE AND WISDOM ARE
ABSTRACTED AND THAT THIS IS THE ULTIMATE CAUSE AND CONDITION OF THE
EXISTENCE OF ALL OF THEM AND WHILE REMAINING IN THEM IS ALSO THEIR
PRESERVATIVE AND WE WERE SAYING THAT IF THE THREE WERE DISCOVERED BY
US JUSTICE WOULD BE THE FOURTH OR REMAINING ONE
THAT FOLLOWS OF NECESSITY
IF WE ARE ASKED TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE FOUR QUALITIES BY ITS
PRESENCE CONTRIBUTES MOST TO THE EXCELLENCE OF THE STATE WHETHER THE
AGREEMENT OF RULERS AND SUBJECTS OR THE PRESERVATION IN THE SOLDIERS OF
THE OPINION WHICH THE LAW ORDAINS ABOUT THE TRUE NATURE OF DANGERS OR
WISDOM AND WATCHFULNESS IN THE RULERS OR WHETHER THIS OTHER WHICH I AM
MENTIONING AND WHICH IS FOUND IN CHILDREN AND WOMEN SLAVE AND FREEMAN
ARTISAN RULER SUBJECT THE QUALITY I MEAN OF EVERY ONE DOING HIS
OWN WORK AND NOT BEING A BUSYBODY WOULD CLAIM THE PALM THE QUESTION
IS NOT SO EASILY ANSWERED
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED THERE WOULD BE A DIFFICULTY IN SAYING WHICH
THEN THE POWER OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THE STATE TO DO HIS OWN WORK
APPEARS TO COMPETE WITH THE OTHER POLITICAL VIRTUES WISDOM TEMPERANCE
COURAGE
YES HE SAID
AND THE VIRTUE WHICH ENTERS INTO THIS COMPETITION IS JUSTICE
EXACTLY
LET US LOOK AT THE QUESTION FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW ARE NOT
THE RULERS IN A STATE THOSE TO WHOM YOU WOULD ENTRUST THE OFFICE OF
DETERMINING SUITS AT LAW
CERTAINLY
AND ARE SUITS DECIDED ON ANY OTHER GROUND BUT THAT A MAN MAY NEITHER
TAKE WHAT IS ANOTHER'S NOR BE DEPRIVED OF WHAT IS HIS OWN
YES THAT IS THEIR PRINCIPLE
WHICH IS A JUST PRINCIPLE
YES
THEN ON THIS VIEW ALSO JUSTICE WILL BE ADMITTED TO BE THE HAVING AND
DOING WHAT IS A MAN'S OWN AND BELONGS TO HIM
VERY TRUE
THINK NOW AND SAY WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME OR NOT
SUPPOSE A
CARPENTER TO BE DOING THE BUSINESS OF A COBBLER OR A COBBLER OF A
CARPENTER AND SUPPOSE THEM TO EXCHANGE THEIR IMPLEMENTS OR THEIR
DUTIES OR THE SAME PERSON TO BE DOING THE WORK OF BOTH OR WHATEVER BE
THE CHANGE DO YOU THINK THAT ANY GREAT HARM WOULD RESULT TO THE STATE
NOT MUCH
BUT WHEN THE COBBLER OR ANY OTHER MAN WHOM NATURE DESIGNED TO BE A
TRADER HAVING HIS HEART LIFTED UP BY WEALTH OR STRENGTH OR THE NUMBER
OF HIS FOLLOWERS OR ANY LIKE ADVANTAGE ATTEMPTS TO FORCE HIS WAY
INTO THE CLASS OF WARRIORS OR A WARRIOR INTO THAT OF LEGISLATORS AND
GUARDIANS FOR WHICH HE IS UNFITTED AND EITHER TO TAKE THE IMPLEMENTS
OR THE DUTIES OF THE OTHER OR WHEN ONE MAN IS TRADER LEGISLATOR AND
WARRIOR ALL IN ONE THEN I THINK YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME IN SAYING THAT
THIS INTERCHANGE AND THIS MEDDLING OF ONE WITH ANOTHER IS THE RUIN OF
THE STATE
MOST TRUE
SEEING THEN I SAID THAT THERE ARE THREE DISTINCT CLASSES ANY MEDDLING
OF ONE WITH ANOTHER OR THE CHANGE OF ONE INTO ANOTHER IS THE GREATEST
HARM TO THE STATE AND MAY BE MOST JUSTLY TERMED EVIL DOING
PRECISELY
AND THE GREATEST DEGREE OF EVIL DOING TO ONE'S OWN CITY WOULD BE TERMED
BY YOU INJUSTICE
CERTAINLY
THIS THEN IS INJUSTICE AND ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN THE TRADER THE
AUXILIARY AND THE GUARDIAN EACH DO THEIR OWN BUSINESS THAT IS JUSTICE
AND WILL MAKE THE CITY JUST
I AGREE WITH YOU
WE WILL NOT I SAID BE OVER POSITIVE AS YET BUT IF ON TRIAL THIS
CONCEPTION OF JUSTICE BE VERIFIED IN THE INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS IN
THE STATE THERE WILL BE NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT IF IT BE NOT
VERIFIED WE MUST HAVE A FRESH ENQUIRY
FIRST LET US COMPLETE THE OLD
INVESTIGATION WHICH WE BEGAN AS YOU REMEMBER UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT IF WE COULD PREVIOUSLY EXAMINE JUSTICE ON THE LARGER SCALE THERE
WOULD BE LESS DIFFICULTY IN DISCERNING HER IN THE INDIVIDUAL
THAT
LARGER EXAMPLE APPEARED TO BE THE STATE AND ACCORDINGLY WE CONSTRUCTED
AS GOOD A ONE AS WE COULD KNOWING WELL THAT IN THE GOOD STATE JUSTICE
WOULD BE FOUND
LET THE DISCOVERY WHICH WE MADE BE NOW APPLIED TO THE
INDIVIDUAL IF THEY AGREE WE SHALL BE SATISFIED OR IF THERE BE A
DIFFERENCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL WE WILL COME BACK TO THE STATE AND
HAVE ANOTHER TRIAL OF THE THEORY
THE FRICTION OF THE TWO WHEN RUBBED
TOGETHER MAY POSSIBLY STRIKE A LIGHT IN WHICH JUSTICE WILL SHINE FORTH
AND THE VISION WHICH IS THEN REVEALED WE WILL FIX IN OUR SOULS
THAT WILL BE IN REGULAR COURSE LET US DO AS YOU SAY
I PROCEEDED TO ASK WHEN TWO THINGS A GREATER AND LESS ARE CALLED BY
THE SAME NAME ARE THEY LIKE OR UNLIKE IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE CALLED THE
SAME
LIKE HE REPLIED
THE JUST MAN THEN IF WE REGARD THE IDEA OF JUSTICE ONLY WILL BE LIKE
THE JUST STATE
HE WILL
AND A STATE WAS THOUGHT BY US TO BE JUST WHEN THE THREE CLASSES IN THE
STATE SEVERALLY DID THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND ALSO THOUGHT TO BE TEMPERATE
AND VALIANT AND WISE BY REASON OF CERTAIN OTHER AFFECTIONS AND QUALITIES
OF THESE SAME CLASSES
TRUE HE SAID
AND SO OF THE INDIVIDUAL WE MAY ASSUME THAT HE HAS THE SAME THREE
PRINCIPLES IN HIS OWN SOUL WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE STATE AND HE MAY BE
RIGHTLY DESCRIBED IN THE SAME TERMS BECAUSE HE IS AFFECTED IN THE SAME
MANNER
CERTAINLY HE SAID
ONCE MORE THEN O MY FRIEND WE HAVE ALIGHTED UPON AN EASY
QUESTION WHETHER THE SOUL HAS THESE THREE PRINCIPLES OR NOT
AN EASY QUESTION NAY RATHER SOCRATES THE PROVERB HOLDS THAT HARD IS
THE GOOD
VERY TRUE I SAID AND I DO NOT THINK THAT THE METHOD WHICH WE ARE
EMPLOYING IS AT ALL ADEQUATE TO THE ACCURATE SOLUTION OF THIS QUESTION
THE TRUE METHOD IS ANOTHER AND A LONGER ONE
STILL WE MAY ARRIVE AT A
SOLUTION NOT BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE PREVIOUS ENQUIRY
MAY WE NOT BE SATISFIED WITH THAT HE SAID UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I
AM QUITE CONTENT
I TOO I REPLIED SHALL BE EXTREMELY WELL SATISFIED
THEN FAINT NOT IN PURSUING THE SPECULATION HE SAID
MUST WE NOT ACKNOWLEDGE I SAID THAT IN EACH OF US THERE ARE THE SAME
PRINCIPLES AND HABITS WHICH THERE ARE IN THE STATE AND THAT FROM THE
INDIVIDUAL THEY PASS INTO THE STATE HOW ELSE CAN THEY COME THERE TAKE
THE QUALITY OF PASSION OR SPIRIT IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS TO IMAGINE
THAT THIS QUALITY WHEN FOUND IN STATES IS NOT DERIVED FROM THE
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO POSSESS IT E G
THE THRACIANS
SCYTHIANS AND IN GENERAL THE NORTHERN NATIONS AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID
OF THE LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS THE SPECIAL CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR
PART OF THE WORLD OR OF THE LOVE OF MONEY WHICH MAY WITH EQUAL TRUTH
BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PHOENICIANS AND EGYPTIANS
EXACTLY SO HE SAID
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THIS
NONE WHATEVER
BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT QUITE SO EASY WHEN WE PROCEED TO ASK WHETHER
THESE PRINCIPLES ARE THREE OR ONE WHETHER THAT IS TO SAY WE LEARN
WITH ONE PART OF OUR NATURE ARE ANGRY WITH ANOTHER AND WITH A THIRD
PART DESIRE THE SATISFACTION OF OUR NATURAL APPETITES OR WHETHER THE
WHOLE SOUL COMES INTO PLAY IN EACH SORT OF ACTION TO DETERMINE THAT IS
THE DIFFICULTY
YES HE SAID THERE LIES THE DIFFICULTY
THEN LET US NOW TRY AND DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE THE SAME OR
DIFFERENT
HOW CAN WE HE ASKED
I REPLIED AS FOLLOWS THE SAME THING CLEARLY CANNOT ACT OR BE ACTED UPON
IN THE SAME PART OR IN RELATION TO THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME
IN CONTRARY WAYS AND THEREFORE WHENEVER THIS CONTRADICTION OCCURS IN
THINGS APPARENTLY THE SAME WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE REALLY NOT THE SAME
BUT DIFFERENT
GOOD
FOR EXAMPLE I SAID CAN THE SAME THING BE AT REST AND IN MOTION AT THE
SAME TIME IN THE SAME PART
IMPOSSIBLE
STILL I SAID LET US HAVE A MORE PRECISE STATEMENT OF TERMS LEST WE
SHOULD HEREAFTER FALL OUT BY THE WAY
IMAGINE THE CASE OF A MAN WHO IS
STANDING AND ALSO MOVING HIS HANDS AND HIS HEAD AND SUPPOSE A PERSON
TO SAY THAT ONE AND THE SAME PERSON IS IN MOTION AND AT REST AT THE SAME
MOMENT TO SUCH A MODE OF SPEECH WE SHOULD OBJECT AND SHOULD RATHER SAY
THAT ONE PART OF HIM IS IN MOTION WHILE ANOTHER IS AT REST
VERY TRUE
AND SUPPOSE THE OBJECTOR TO REFINE STILL FURTHER AND TO DRAW THE NICE
DISTINCTION THAT NOT ONLY PARTS OF TOPS BUT WHOLE TOPS WHEN THEY SPIN
ROUND WITH THEIR PEGS FIXED ON THE SPOT ARE AT REST AND IN MOTION AT
THE SAME TIME AND HE MAY SAY THE SAME OF ANYTHING WHICH REVOLVES IN THE
SAME SPOT HIS OBJECTION WOULD NOT BE ADMITTED BY US BECAUSE IN
SUCH CASES THINGS ARE NOT AT REST AND IN MOTION IN THE SAME PARTS OF
THEMSELVES WE SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT THEY HAVE BOTH AN AXIS AND A
CIRCUMFERENCE AND THAT THE AXIS STANDS STILL FOR THERE IS NO DEVIATION
FROM THE PERPENDICULAR AND THAT THE CIRCUMFERENCE GOES ROUND
BUT IF
WHILE REVOLVING THE AXIS INCLINES EITHER TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT FORWARDS
OR BACKWARDS THEN IN NO POINT OF VIEW CAN THEY BE AT REST
THAT IS THE CORRECT MODE OF DESCRIBING THEM HE REPLIED
THEN NONE OF THESE OBJECTIONS WILL CONFUSE US OR INCLINE US TO BELIEVE
THAT THE SAME THING AT THE SAME TIME IN THE SAME PART OR IN RELATION TO
THE SAME THING CAN ACT OR BE ACTED UPON IN CONTRARY WAYS
CERTAINLY NOT ACCORDING TO MY WAY OF THINKING
YET I SAID THAT WE MAY NOT BE COMPELLED TO EXAMINE ALL SUCH
OBJECTIONS AND PROVE AT LENGTH THAT THEY ARE UNTRUE LET US ASSUME
THEIR ABSURDITY AND GO FORWARD ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HEREAFTER IF
THIS ASSUMPTION TURN OUT TO BE UNTRUE ALL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH FOLLOW
SHALL BE WITHDRAWN
YES HE SAID THAT WILL BE THE BEST WAY
WELL I SAID WOULD YOU NOT ALLOW THAT ASSENT AND DISSENT DESIRE AND
AVERSION ATTRACTION AND REPULSION ARE ALL OF THEM OPPOSITES WHETHER
THEY ARE REGARDED AS ACTIVE OR PASSIVE FOR THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN
THE FACT OF THEIR OPPOSITION
YES HE SAID THEY ARE OPPOSITES
WELL I SAID AND HUNGER AND THIRST AND THE DESIRES IN GENERAL AND
AGAIN WILLING AND WISHING ALL THESE YOU WOULD REFER TO THE CLASSES
ALREADY MENTIONED
YOU WOULD SAY WOULD YOU NOT THAT THE SOUL OF HIM
WHO DESIRES IS SEEKING AFTER THE OBJECT OF HIS DESIRE OR THAT HE IS
DRAWING TO HIMSELF THE THING WHICH HE WISHES TO POSSESS OR AGAIN
WHEN A PERSON WANTS ANYTHING TO BE GIVEN HIM HIS MIND LONGING FOR THE
REALIZATION OF HIS DESIRE INTIMATES HIS WISH TO HAVE IT BY A NOD OF
ASSENT AS IF HE HAD BEEN ASKED A QUESTION
VERY TRUE
AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY OF UNWILLINGNESS AND DISLIKE AND THE ABSENCE OF
DESIRE SHOULD NOT THESE BE REFERRED TO THE OPPOSITE CLASS OF REPULSION
AND REJECTION
CERTAINLY
ADMITTING THIS TO BE TRUE OF DESIRE GENERALLY LET US SUPPOSE A
PARTICULAR CLASS OF DESIRES AND OUT OF THESE WE WILL SELECT HUNGER AND
THIRST AS THEY ARE TERMED WHICH ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THEM
LET US TAKE THAT CLASS HE SAID
THE OBJECT OF ONE IS FOOD AND OF THE OTHER DRINK
YES
AND HERE COMES THE POINT IS NOT THIRST THE DESIRE WHICH THE SOUL HAS OF
DRINK AND OF DRINK ONLY NOT OF DRINK QUALIFIED BY ANYTHING ELSE FOR
EXAMPLE WARM OR COLD OR MUCH OR LITTLE OR IN A WORD DRINK OF ANY
PARTICULAR SORT BUT IF THE THIRST BE ACCOMPANIED BY HEAT THEN THE
DESIRE IS OF COLD DRINK OR IF ACCOMPANIED BY COLD THEN OF WARM DRINK
OR IF THE THIRST BE EXCESSIVE THEN THE DRINK WHICH IS DESIRED WILL BE
EXCESSIVE OR IF NOT GREAT THE QUANTITY OF DRINK WILL ALSO BE SMALL
BUT THIRST PURE AND SIMPLE WILL DESIRE DRINK PURE AND SIMPLE WHICH IS
THE NATURAL SATISFACTION OF THIRST AS FOOD IS OF HUNGER
YES HE SAID THE SIMPLE DESIRE IS AS YOU SAY IN EVERY CASE OF THE
SIMPLE OBJECT AND THE QUALIFIED DESIRE OF THE QUALIFIED OBJECT
BUT HERE A CONFUSION MAY ARISE AND I SHOULD WISH TO GUARD AGAINST AN
OPPONENT STARTING UP AND SAYING THAT NO MAN DESIRES DRINK ONLY BUT GOOD
DRINK OR FOOD ONLY BUT GOOD FOOD FOR GOOD IS THE UNIVERSAL OBJECT OF
DESIRE AND THIRST BEING A DESIRE WILL NECESSARILY BE THIRST AFTER GOOD
DRINK AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF EVERY OTHER DESIRE
YES HE REPLIED THE OPPONENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
NEVERTHELESS I SHOULD STILL MAINTAIN THAT OF RELATIVES SOME HAVE A
QUALITY ATTACHED TO EITHER TERM OF THE RELATION OTHERS ARE SIMPLE AND
HAVE THEIR CORRELATIVES SIMPLE
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
WELL YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT THE GREATER IS RELATIVE TO THE LESS
CERTAINLY
AND THE MUCH GREATER TO THE MUCH LESS
YES
AND THE SOMETIME GREATER TO THE SOMETIME LESS AND THE GREATER THAT IS
TO BE TO THE LESS THAT IS TO BE
CERTAINLY HE SAID
AND SO OF MORE AND LESS AND OF OTHER CORRELATIVE TERMS SUCH AS THE
DOUBLE AND THE HALF OR AGAIN THE HEAVIER AND THE LIGHTER THE SWIFTER
AND THE SLOWER AND OF HOT AND COLD AND OF ANY OTHER RELATIVES IS NOT
THIS TRUE OF ALL OF THEM
YES
AND DOES NOT THE SAME PRINCIPLE HOLD IN THE SCIENCES THE OBJECT OF
SCIENCE IS KNOWLEDGE ASSUMING THAT TO BE THE TRUE DEFINITION BUT
THE OBJECT OF A PARTICULAR SCIENCE IS A PARTICULAR KIND OF KNOWLEDGE
I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SCIENCE OF HOUSE BUILDING IS A KIND OF
KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS DEFINED AND DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER KINDS AND IS
THEREFORE TERMED ARCHITECTURE
CERTAINLY
BECAUSE IT HAS A PARTICULAR QUALITY WHICH NO OTHER HAS
YES
AND IT HAS THIS PARTICULAR QUALITY BECAUSE IT HAS AN OBJECT OF A
PARTICULAR KIND AND THIS IS TRUE OF THE OTHER ARTS AND SCIENCES
YES
NOW THEN IF I HAVE MADE MYSELF CLEAR YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY ORIGINAL
MEANING IN WHAT I SAID ABOUT RELATIVES
MY MEANING WAS THAT IF ONE TERM
OF A RELATION IS TAKEN ALONE THE OTHER IS TAKEN ALONE IF ONE TERM
IS QUALIFIED THE OTHER IS ALSO QUALIFIED
I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT
RELATIVES MAY NOT BE DISPARATE OR THAT THE SCIENCE OF HEALTH IS
HEALTHY OR OF DISEASE NECESSARILY DISEASED OR THAT THE SCIENCES OF
GOOD AND EVIL ARE THEREFORE GOOD AND EVIL BUT ONLY THAT WHEN THE TERM
SCIENCE IS NO LONGER USED ABSOLUTELY BUT HAS A QUALIFIED OBJECT WHICH
IN THIS CASE IS THE NATURE OF HEALTH AND DISEASE IT BECOMES DEFINED
AND IS HENCE CALLED NOT MERELY SCIENCE BUT THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE
I QUITE UNDERSTAND AND I THINK AS YOU DO
WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT THIRST IS ONE OF THESE ESSENTIALLY RELATIVE
TERMS HAVING CLEARLY A RELATION
YES THIRST IS RELATIVE TO DRINK
AND A CERTAIN KIND OF THIRST IS RELATIVE TO A CERTAIN KIND OF DRINK BUT
THIRST TAKEN ALONE IS NEITHER OF MUCH NOR LITTLE NOR OF GOOD NOR BAD
NOR OF ANY PARTICULAR KIND OF DRINK BUT OF DRINK ONLY
CERTAINLY
THEN THE SOUL OF THE THIRSTY ONE IN SO FAR AS HE IS THIRSTY DESIRES
ONLY DRINK FOR THIS HE YEARNS AND TRIES TO OBTAIN IT
THAT IS PLAIN
AND IF YOU SUPPOSE SOMETHING WHICH PULLS A THIRSTY SOUL AWAY FROM DRINK
THAT MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM THE THIRSTY PRINCIPLE WHICH DRAWS HIM LIKE
A BEAST TO DRINK FOR AS WE WERE SAYING THE SAME THING CANNOT AT THE
SAME TIME WITH THE SAME PART OF ITSELF ACT IN CONTRARY WAYS ABOUT THE
SAME
IMPOSSIBLE
NO MORE THAN YOU CAN SAY THAT THE HANDS OF THE ARCHER PUSH AND PULL THE
BOW AT THE SAME TIME BUT WHAT YOU SAY IS THAT ONE HAND PUSHES AND THE
OTHER PULLS
EXACTLY SO HE REPLIED
AND MIGHT A MAN BE THIRSTY AND YET UNWILLING TO DRINK
YES HE SAID IT CONSTANTLY HAPPENS
AND IN SUCH A CASE WHAT IS ONE TO SAY WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT THERE
WAS SOMETHING IN THE SOUL BIDDING A MAN TO DRINK AND SOMETHING ELSE
FORBIDDING HIM WHICH IS OTHER AND STRONGER THAN THE PRINCIPLE WHICH
BIDS HIM
I SHOULD SAY SO
AND THE FORBIDDING PRINCIPLE IS DERIVED FROM REASON AND THAT WHICH BIDS
AND ATTRACTS PROCEEDS FROM PASSION AND DISEASE
CLEARLY
THEN WE MAY FAIRLY ASSUME THAT THEY ARE TWO AND THAT THEY DIFFER FROM
ONE ANOTHER THE ONE WITH WHICH A MAN REASONS WE MAY CALL THE RATIONAL
PRINCIPLE OF THE SOUL THE OTHER WITH WHICH HE LOVES AND HUNGERS AND
THIRSTS AND FEELS THE FLUTTERINGS OF ANY OTHER DESIRE MAY BE TERMED
THE IRRATIONAL OR APPETITIVE THE ALLY OF SUNDRY PLEASURES AND
SATISFACTIONS
YES HE SAID WE MAY FAIRLY ASSUME THEM TO BE DIFFERENT
THEN LET US FINALLY DETERMINE THAT THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPLES EXISTING IN
THE SOUL
AND WHAT OF PASSION OR SPIRIT IS IT A THIRD OR AKIN TO ONE
OF THE PRECEDING
I SHOULD BE INCLINED TO SAY AKIN TO DESIRE
WELL I SAID THERE IS A STORY WHICH I REMEMBER TO HAVE HEARD AND IN
WHICH I PUT FAITH
THE STORY IS THAT LEONTIUS THE SON OF AGLAION
COMING UP ONE DAY FROM THE PIRAEUS UNDER THE NORTH WALL ON THE OUTSIDE
OBSERVED SOME DEAD BODIES LYING ON THE GROUND AT THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
HE FELT A DESIRE TO SEE THEM AND ALSO A DREAD AND ABHORRENCE OF THEM
FOR A TIME HE STRUGGLED AND COVERED HIS EYES BUT AT LENGTH THE DESIRE
GOT THE BETTER OF HIM AND FORCING THEM OPEN HE RAN UP TO THE DEAD
BODIES SAYING LOOK YE WRETCHES TAKE YOUR FILL OF THE FAIR SIGHT
I HAVE HEARD THE STORY MYSELF HE SAID
THE MORAL OF THE TALE IS THAT ANGER AT TIMES GOES TO WAR WITH DESIRE
AS THOUGH THEY WERE TWO DISTINCT THINGS
YES THAT IS THE MEANING HE SAID
AND ARE THERE NOT MANY OTHER CASES IN WHICH WE OBSERVE THAT WHEN A MAN'S
DESIRES VIOLENTLY PREVAIL OVER HIS REASON HE REVILES HIMSELF AND IS
ANGRY AT THE VIOLENCE WITHIN HIM AND THAT IN THIS STRUGGLE WHICH IS
LIKE THE STRUGGLE OF FACTIONS IN A STATE HIS SPIRIT IS ON THE SIDE OF
HIS REASON BUT FOR THE PASSIONATE OR SPIRITED ELEMENT TO TAKE PART
WITH THE DESIRES WHEN REASON DECIDES THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE OPPOSED
IS A SORT OF THING WHICH I BELIEVE THAT YOU NEVER OBSERVED OCCURRING IN
YOURSELF NOR AS I SHOULD IMAGINE IN ANY ONE ELSE
CERTAINLY NOT
SUPPOSE THAT A MAN THINKS HE HAS DONE A WRONG TO ANOTHER THE NOBLER
HE IS THE LESS ABLE IS HE TO FEEL INDIGNANT AT ANY SUFFERING SUCH AS
HUNGER OR COLD OR ANY OTHER PAIN WHICH THE INJURED PERSON MAY INFLICT
UPON HIM THESE HE DEEMS TO BE JUST AND AS I SAY HIS ANGER REFUSES TO
BE EXCITED BY THEM
TRUE HE SAID
BUT WHEN HE THINKS THAT HE IS THE SUFFERER OF THE WRONG THEN HE BOILS
AND CHAFES AND IS ON THE SIDE OF WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE JUSTICE AND
BECAUSE HE SUFFERS HUNGER OR COLD OR OTHER PAIN HE IS ONLY THE MORE
DETERMINED TO PERSEVERE AND CONQUER
HIS NOBLE SPIRIT WILL NOT BE
QUELLED UNTIL HE EITHER SLAYS OR IS SLAIN OR UNTIL HE HEARS THE VOICE
OF THE SHEPHERD THAT IS REASON BIDDING HIS DOG BARK NO MORE
THE ILLUSTRATION IS PERFECT HE REPLIED AND IN OUR STATE AS WE WERE
SAYING THE AUXILIARIES WERE TO BE DOGS AND TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE
RULERS WHO ARE THEIR SHEPHERDS
I PERCEIVE I SAID THAT YOU QUITE UNDERSTAND ME THERE IS HOWEVER A
FURTHER POINT WHICH I WISH YOU TO CONSIDER
WHAT POINT
YOU REMEMBER THAT PASSION OR SPIRIT APPEARED AT FIRST SIGHT TO BE A KIND
OF DESIRE BUT NOW WE SHOULD SAY QUITE THE CONTRARY FOR IN THE CONFLICT
OF THE SOUL SPIRIT IS ARRAYED ON THE SIDE OF THE RATIONAL PRINCIPLE
MOST ASSUREDLY
BUT A FURTHER QUESTION ARISES IS PASSION DIFFERENT FROM REASON ALSO OR
ONLY A KIND OF REASON IN WHICH LATTER CASE INSTEAD OF THREE PRINCIPLES
IN THE SOUL THERE WILL ONLY BE TWO THE RATIONAL AND THE CONCUPISCENT
OR RATHER AS THE STATE WAS COMPOSED OF THREE CLASSES TRADERS
AUXILIARIES COUNSELLORS SO MAY THERE NOT BE IN THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL A
THIRD ELEMENT WHICH IS PASSION OR SPIRIT AND WHEN NOT CORRUPTED BY BAD
EDUCATION IS THE NATURAL AUXILIARY OF REASON
YES HE SAID THERE MUST BE A THIRD
YES I REPLIED IF PASSION WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO BE DIFFERENT
FROM DESIRE TURN OUT ALSO TO BE DIFFERENT FROM REASON
BUT THAT IS EASILY PROVED WE MAY OBSERVE EVEN IN YOUNG CHILDREN THAT
THEY ARE FULL OF SPIRIT ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY ARE BORN WHEREAS SOME
OF THEM NEVER SEEM TO ATTAIN TO THE USE OF REASON AND MOST OF THEM LATE
ENOUGH
EXCELLENT I SAID AND YOU MAY SEE PASSION EQUALLY IN BRUTE ANIMALS
WHICH IS A FURTHER PROOF OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
AND WE MAY
ONCE MORE APPEAL TO THE WORDS OF HOMER WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY QUOTED
BY US
'HE SMOTE HIS BREAST AND THUS REBUKED HIS SOUL
FOR IN THIS VERSE HOMER HAS CLEARLY SUPPOSED THE POWER WHICH REASONS
ABOUT THE BETTER AND WORSE TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE UNREASONING ANGER
WHICH IS REBUKED BY IT
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND SO AFTER MUCH TOSSING WE HAVE REACHED LAND AND ARE FAIRLY AGREED
THAT THE SAME PRINCIPLES WHICH EXIST IN THE STATE EXIST ALSO IN THE
INDIVIDUAL AND THAT THEY ARE THREE IN NUMBER
EXACTLY
MUST WE NOT THEN INFER THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS WISE IN THE SAME WAY AND
IN VIRTUE OF THE SAME QUALITY WHICH MAKES THE STATE WISE
CERTAINLY
ALSO THAT THE SAME QUALITY WHICH CONSTITUTES COURAGE IN THE STATE
CONSTITUTES COURAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THAT BOTH THE STATE AND THE
INDIVIDUAL BEAR THE SAME RELATION TO ALL THE OTHER VIRTUES
ASSUREDLY
AND THE INDIVIDUAL WILL BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY US TO BE JUST IN THE SAME WAY
IN WHICH THE STATE IS JUST
THAT FOLLOWS OF COURSE
WE CANNOT BUT REMEMBER THAT THE JUSTICE OF THE STATE CONSISTED IN EACH
OF THE THREE CLASSES DOING THE WORK OF ITS OWN CLASS
WE ARE NOT VERY LIKELY TO HAVE FORGOTTEN HE SAID
WE MUST RECOLLECT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IN WHOM THE SEVERAL QUALITIES OF
HIS NATURE DO THEIR OWN WORK WILL BE JUST AND WILL DO HIS OWN WORK
YES HE SAID WE MUST REMEMBER THAT TOO
AND OUGHT NOT THE RATIONAL PRINCIPLE WHICH IS WISE AND HAS THE CARE OF
THE WHOLE SOUL TO RULE AND THE PASSIONATE OR SPIRITED PRINCIPLE TO BE
THE SUBJECT AND ALLY
CERTAINLY
AND AS WE WERE SAYING THE UNITED INFLUENCE OF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC WILL
BRING THEM INTO ACCORD NERVING AND SUSTAINING THE REASON WITH NOBLE
WORDS AND LESSONS AND MODERATING AND SOOTHING AND CIVILIZING THE
WILDNESS OF PASSION BY HARMONY AND RHYTHM
QUITE TRUE HE SAID
AND THESE TWO THUS NURTURED AND EDUCATED AND HAVING LEARNED TRULY TO
KNOW THEIR OWN FUNCTIONS WILL RULE OVER THE CONCUPISCENT WHICH IN EACH
OF US IS THE LARGEST PART OF THE SOUL AND BY NATURE MOST INSATIABLE OF
GAIN OVER THIS THEY WILL KEEP GUARD LEST WAXING GREAT AND STRONG WITH
THE FULNESS OF BODILY PLEASURES AS THEY ARE TERMED THE CONCUPISCENT
SOUL NO LONGER CONFINED TO HER OWN SPHERE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO ENSLAVE
AND RULE THOSE WHO ARE NOT HER NATURAL BORN SUBJECTS AND OVERTURN THE
WHOLE LIFE OF MAN
VERY TRUE HE SAID
BOTH TOGETHER WILL THEY NOT BE THE BEST DEFENDERS OF THE WHOLE SOUL AND
THE WHOLE BODY AGAINST ATTACKS FROM WITHOUT THE ONE COUNSELLING AND
THE OTHER FIGHTING UNDER HIS LEADER AND COURAGEOUSLY EXECUTING HIS
COMMANDS AND COUNSELS
TRUE
AND HE IS TO BE DEEMED COURAGEOUS WHOSE SPIRIT RETAINS IN PLEASURE AND
IN PAIN THE COMMANDS OF REASON ABOUT WHAT HE OUGHT OR OUGHT NOT TO FEAR
RIGHT HE REPLIED
AND HIM WE CALL WISE WHO HAS IN HIM THAT LITTLE PART WHICH RULES AND
WHICH PROCLAIMS THESE COMMANDS THAT PART TOO BEING SUPPOSED TO HAVE A
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS FOR THE INTEREST OF EACH OF THE THREE PARTS AND OF
THE WHOLE
ASSUREDLY
AND WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT HE IS TEMPERATE WHO HAS THESE SAME ELEMENTS
IN FRIENDLY HARMONY IN WHOM THE ONE RULING PRINCIPLE OF REASON AND
THE TWO SUBJECT ONES OF SPIRIT AND DESIRE ARE EQUALLY AGREED THAT REASON
OUGHT TO RULE AND DO NOT REBEL
CERTAINLY HE SAID THAT IS THE TRUE ACCOUNT OF TEMPERANCE WHETHER IN
THE STATE OR INDIVIDUAL
AND SURELY I SAID WE HAVE EXPLAINED AGAIN AND AGAIN HOW AND BY VIRTUE
OF WHAT QUALITY A MAN WILL BE JUST
THAT IS VERY CERTAIN
AND IS JUSTICE DIMMER IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND IS HER FORM DIFFERENT OR
IS SHE THE SAME WHICH WE FOUND HER TO BE IN THE STATE
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN MY OPINION HE SAID
BECAUSE IF ANY DOUBT IS STILL LINGERING IN OUR MINDS A FEW COMMONPLACE
INSTANCES WILL SATISFY US OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT I AM SAYING
WHAT SORT OF INSTANCES DO YOU MEAN
IF THE CASE IS PUT TO US MUST WE NOT ADMIT THAT THE JUST STATE OR
THE MAN WHO IS TRAINED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF SUCH A STATE WILL BE LESS
LIKELY THAN THE UNJUST TO MAKE AWAY WITH A DEPOSIT OF GOLD OR SILVER
WOULD ANY ONE DENY THIS
NO ONE HE REPLIED
WILL THE JUST MAN OR CITIZEN EVER BE GUILTY OF SACRILEGE OR THEFT OR
TREACHERY EITHER TO HIS FRIENDS OR TO HIS COUNTRY
NEVER
NEITHER WILL HE EVER BREAK FAITH WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN OATHS OR
AGREEMENTS
IMPOSSIBLE
NO ONE WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT ADULTERY OR TO DISHONOUR HIS
FATHER AND MOTHER OR TO FAIL IN HIS RELIGIOUS DUTIES
NO ONE
AND THE REASON IS THAT EACH PART OF HIM IS DOING ITS OWN BUSINESS
WHETHER IN RULING OR BEING RULED
EXACTLY SO
ARE YOU SATISFIED THEN THAT THE QUALITY WHICH MAKES SUCH MEN AND SUCH
STATES IS JUSTICE OR DO YOU HOPE TO DISCOVER SOME OTHER
NOT I INDEED
THEN OUR DREAM HAS BEEN REALIZED AND THE SUSPICION WHICH WE ENTERTAINED
AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORK OF CONSTRUCTION THAT SOME DIVINE POWER
MUST HAVE CONDUCTED US TO A PRIMARY FORM OF JUSTICE HAS NOW BEEN
VERIFIED
YES CERTAINLY
AND THE DIVISION OF LABOUR WHICH REQUIRED THE CARPENTER AND THE
SHOEMAKER AND THE REST OF THE CITIZENS TO BE DOING EACH HIS OWN
BUSINESS AND NOT ANOTHER'S WAS A SHADOW OF JUSTICE AND FOR THAT
REASON IT WAS OF USE
CLEARLY
BUT IN REALITY JUSTICE WAS SUCH AS WE WERE DESCRIBING BEING CONCERNED
HOWEVER NOT WITH THE OUTWARD MAN BUT WITH THE INWARD WHICH IS THE
TRUE SELF AND CONCERNMENT OF MAN FOR THE JUST MAN DOES NOT PERMIT THE
SEVERAL ELEMENTS WITHIN HIM TO INTERFERE WITH ONE ANOTHER OR ANY OF
THEM TO DO THE WORK OF OTHERS HE SETS IN ORDER HIS OWN INNER LIFE AND
IS HIS OWN MASTER AND HIS OWN LAW AND AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF AND WHEN
HE HAS BOUND TOGETHER THE THREE PRINCIPLES WITHIN HIM WHICH MAY BE
COMPARED TO THE HIGHER LOWER AND MIDDLE NOTES OF THE SCALE AND THE
INTERMEDIATE INTERVALS WHEN HE HAS BOUND ALL THESE TOGETHER AND IS
NO LONGER MANY BUT HAS BECOME ONE ENTIRELY TEMPERATE AND PERFECTLY
ADJUSTED NATURE THEN HE PROCEEDS TO ACT IF HE HAS TO ACT WHETHER IN
A MATTER OF PROPERTY OR IN THE TREATMENT OF THE BODY OR IN SOME AFFAIR
OF POLITICS OR PRIVATE BUSINESS ALWAYS THINKING AND CALLING THAT WHICH
PRESERVES AND CO OPERATES WITH THIS HARMONIOUS CONDITION JUST AND GOOD
ACTION AND THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH PRESIDES OVER IT WISDOM AND THAT WHICH
AT ANY TIME IMPAIRS THIS CONDITION HE WILL CALL UNJUST ACTION AND THE
OPINION WHICH PRESIDES OVER IT IGNORANCE
YOU HAVE SAID THE EXACT TRUTH SOCRATES
VERY GOOD AND IF WE WERE TO AFFIRM THAT WE HAD DISCOVERED THE JUST MAN
AND THE JUST STATE AND THE NATURE OF JUSTICE IN EACH OF THEM WE SHOULD
NOT BE TELLING A FALSEHOOD
MOST CERTAINLY NOT
MAY WE SAY SO THEN
LET US SAY SO
AND NOW I SAID INJUSTICE HAS TO BE CONSIDERED
CLEARLY
MUST NOT INJUSTICE BE A STRIFE WHICH ARISES AMONG THE THREE
PRINCIPLES A MEDDLESOMENESS AND INTERFERENCE AND RISING UP OF A PART
OF THE SOUL AGAINST THE WHOLE AN ASSERTION OF UNLAWFUL AUTHORITY WHICH
IS MADE BY A REBELLIOUS SUBJECT AGAINST A TRUE PRINCE OF WHOM HE IS THE
NATURAL VASSAL WHAT IS ALL THIS CONFUSION AND DELUSION BUT INJUSTICE
AND INTEMPERANCE AND COWARDICE AND IGNORANCE AND EVERY FORM OF VICE
EXACTLY SO
AND IF THE NATURE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE BE KNOWN THEN THE MEANING OF
ACTING UNJUSTLY AND BEING UNJUST OR AGAIN OF ACTING JUSTLY WILL ALSO
BE PERFECTLY CLEAR
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
WHY I SAID THEY ARE LIKE DISEASE AND HEALTH BEING IN THE SOUL JUST
WHAT DISEASE AND HEALTH ARE IN THE BODY
HOW SO HE SAID
WHY I SAID THAT WHICH IS HEALTHY CAUSES HEALTH AND THAT WHICH IS
UNHEALTHY CAUSES DISEASE
YES
AND JUST ACTIONS CAUSE JUSTICE AND UNJUST ACTIONS CAUSE INJUSTICE
THAT IS CERTAIN
AND THE CREATION OF HEALTH IS THE INSTITUTION OF A NATURAL ORDER AND
GOVERNMENT OF ONE BY ANOTHER IN THE PARTS OF THE BODY AND THE CREATION
OF DISEASE IS THE PRODUCTION OF A STATE OF THINGS AT VARIANCE WITH THIS
NATURAL ORDER
TRUE
AND IS NOT THE CREATION OF JUSTICE THE INSTITUTION OF A NATURAL ORDER
AND GOVERNMENT OF ONE BY ANOTHER IN THE PARTS OF THE SOUL AND THE
CREATION OF INJUSTICE THE PRODUCTION OF A STATE OF THINGS AT VARIANCE
WITH THE NATURAL ORDER
EXACTLY SO HE SAID
THEN VIRTUE IS THE HEALTH AND BEAUTY AND WELL BEING OF THE SOUL AND
VICE THE DISEASE AND WEAKNESS AND DEFORMITY OF THE SAME
TRUE
AND DO NOT GOOD PRACTICES LEAD TO VIRTUE AND EVIL PRACTICES TO VICE
ASSUREDLY
STILL OUR OLD QUESTION OF THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE OF JUSTICE AND
INJUSTICE HAS NOT BEEN ANSWERED WHICH IS THE MORE PROFITABLE TO BE
JUST AND ACT JUSTLY AND PRACTISE VIRTUE WHETHER SEEN OR UNSEEN OF
GODS AND MEN OR TO BE UNJUST AND ACT UNJUSTLY IF ONLY UNPUNISHED AND
UNREFORMED
IN MY JUDGMENT SOCRATES THE QUESTION HAS NOW BECOME RIDICULOUS
WE
KNOW THAT WHEN THE BODILY CONSTITUTION IS GONE LIFE IS NO LONGER
ENDURABLE THOUGH PAMPERED WITH ALL KINDS OF MEATS AND DRINKS AND
HAVING ALL WEALTH AND ALL POWER AND SHALL WE BE TOLD THAT WHEN THE
VERY ESSENCE OF THE VITAL PRINCIPLE IS UNDERMINED AND CORRUPTED LIFE
IS STILL WORTH HAVING TO A MAN IF ONLY HE BE ALLOWED TO DO WHATEVER HE
LIKES WITH THE SINGLE EXCEPTION THAT HE IS NOT TO ACQUIRE JUSTICE AND
VIRTUE OR TO ESCAPE FROM INJUSTICE AND VICE ASSUMING THEM BOTH TO BE
SUCH AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED
YES I SAID THE QUESTION IS AS YOU SAY RIDICULOUS
STILL AS WE ARE
NEAR THE SPOT AT WHICH WE MAY SEE THE TRUTH IN THE CLEAREST MANNER WITH
OUR OWN EYES LET US NOT FAINT BY THE WAY
CERTAINLY NOT HE REPLIED
COME UP HITHER I SAID AND BEHOLD THE VARIOUS FORMS OF VICE THOSE OF
THEM I MEAN WHICH ARE WORTH LOOKING AT
I AM FOLLOWING YOU HE REPLIED PROCEED
I SAID THE ARGUMENT SEEMS TO HAVE REACHED A HEIGHT FROM WHICH AS FROM
SOME TOWER OF SPECULATION A MAN MAY LOOK DOWN AND SEE THAT VIRTUE
IS ONE BUT THAT THE FORMS OF VICE ARE INNUMERABLE THERE BEING FOUR
SPECIAL ONES WHICH ARE DESERVING OF NOTE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
I MEAN I REPLIED THAT THERE APPEAR TO BE AS MANY FORMS OF THE SOUL AS
THERE ARE DISTINCT FORMS OF THE STATE
HOW MANY
THERE ARE FIVE OF THE STATE AND FIVE OF THE SOUL I SAID
WHAT ARE THEY
THE FIRST I SAID IS THAT WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING AND WHICH MAY
BE SAID TO HAVE TWO NAMES MONARCHY AND ARISTOCRACY ACCORDINGLY AS RULE
IS EXERCISED BY ONE DISTINGUISHED MAN OR BY MANY
TRUE HE REPLIED
BUT I REGARD THE TWO NAMES AS DESCRIBING ONE FORM ONLY FOR WHETHER THE
GOVERNMENT IS IN THE HANDS OF ONE OR MANY IF THE GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN
TRAINED IN THE MANNER WHICH WE HAVE SUPPOSED THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF
THE STATE WILL BE MAINTAINED
THAT IS TRUE HE REPLIED
BOOK V
SUCH IS THE GOOD AND TRUE CITY OR STATE AND THE GOOD AND TRUE MAN IS
OF THE SAME PATTERN AND IF THIS IS RIGHT EVERY OTHER IS WRONG AND THE
EVIL IS ONE WHICH AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE ORDERING OF THE STATE BUT ALSO
THE REGULATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL AND IS EXHIBITED IN FOUR FORMS
WHAT ARE THEY HE SAID
I WAS PROCEEDING TO TELL THE ORDER IN WHICH THE FOUR EVIL FORMS APPEARED
TO ME TO SUCCEED ONE ANOTHER WHEN POLEMARCHUS WHO WAS SITTING A LITTLE
WAY OFF JUST BEYOND ADEIMANTUS BEGAN TO WHISPER TO HIM STRETCHING
FORTH HIS HAND HE TOOK HOLD OF THE UPPER PART OF HIS COAT BY THE
SHOULDER AND DREW HIM TOWARDS HIM LEANING FORWARD HIMSELF SO AS TO BE
QUITE CLOSE AND SAYING SOMETHING IN HIS EAR OF WHICH I ONLY CAUGHT THE
WORDS 'SHALL WE LET HIM OFF OR WHAT SHALL WE DO
CERTAINLY NOT SAID ADEIMANTUS RAISING HIS VOICE
WHO IS IT I SAID WHOM YOU ARE REFUSING TO LET OFF
YOU HE SAID
I REPEATED WHY AM I ESPECIALLY NOT TO BE LET OFF
WHY HE SAID WE THINK THAT YOU ARE LAZY AND MEAN TO CHEAT US OUT OF A
WHOLE CHAPTER WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY AND YOU FANCY
THAT WE SHALL NOT NOTICE YOUR AIRY WAY OF PROCEEDING AS IF IT WERE
SELF EVIDENT TO EVERYBODY THAT IN THE MATTER OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN
'FRIENDS HAVE ALL THINGS IN COMMON
AND WAS I NOT RIGHT ADEIMANTUS
YES HE SAID BUT WHAT IS RIGHT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE LIKE EVERYTHING
ELSE REQUIRES TO BE EXPLAINED FOR COMMUNITY MAY BE OF MANY KINDS
PLEASE THEREFORE TO SAY WHAT SORT OF COMMUNITY YOU MEAN
WE HAVE BEEN
LONG EXPECTING THAT YOU WOULD TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE FAMILY LIFE
OF YOUR CITIZENS HOW THEY WILL BRING CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD AND REAR
THEM WHEN THEY HAVE ARRIVED AND IN GENERAL WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS
COMMUNITY OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN FOR WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE RIGHT
OR WRONG MANAGEMENT OF SUCH MATTERS WILL HAVE A GREAT AND PARAMOUNT
INFLUENCE ON THE STATE FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL
AND NOW SINCE THE QUESTION
IS STILL UNDETERMINED AND YOU ARE TAKING IN HAND ANOTHER STATE WE HAVE
RESOLVED AS YOU HEARD NOT TO LET YOU GO UNTIL YOU GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF
ALL THIS
TO THAT RESOLUTION SAID GLAUCON YOU MAY REGARD ME AS SAYING AGREED
AND WITHOUT MORE ADO SAID THRASYMACHUS YOU MAY CONSIDER US ALL TO BE
EQUALLY AGREED
I SAID YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN THUS ASSAILING ME WHAT AN
ARGUMENT ARE YOU RAISING ABOUT THE STATE JUST AS I THOUGHT THAT I HAD
FINISHED AND WAS ONLY TOO GLAD THAT I HAD LAID THIS QUESTION TO SLEEP
AND WAS REFLECTING HOW FORTUNATE I WAS IN YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF WHAT I THEN
SAID YOU ASK ME TO BEGIN AGAIN AT THE VERY FOUNDATION IGNORANT OF WHAT
A HORNET'S NEST OF WORDS YOU ARE STIRRING
NOW I FORESAW THIS GATHERING
TROUBLE AND AVOIDED IT
FOR WHAT PURPOSE DO YOU CONCEIVE THAT WE HAVE COME HERE SAID
THRASYMACHUS TO LOOK FOR GOLD OR TO HEAR DISCOURSE
YES BUT DISCOURSE SHOULD HAVE A LIMIT
YES SOCRATES SAID GLAUCON AND THE WHOLE OF LIFE IS THE ONLY LIMIT
WHICH WISE MEN ASSIGN TO THE HEARING OF SUCH DISCOURSES
BUT NEVER MIND
ABOUT US TAKE HEART YOURSELF AND ANSWER THE QUESTION IN YOUR OWN WAY
WHAT SORT OF COMMUNITY OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IS THIS WHICH IS TO PREVAIL
AMONG OUR GUARDIANS AND HOW SHALL WE MANAGE THE PERIOD BETWEEN BIRTH
AND EDUCATION WHICH SEEMS TO REQUIRE THE GREATEST CARE TELL US HOW
THESE THINGS WILL BE
YES MY SIMPLE FRIEND BUT THE ANSWER IS THE REVERSE OF EASY MANY MORE
DOUBTS ARISE ABOUT THIS THAN ABOUT OUR PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS
FOR THE
PRACTICABILITY OF WHAT IS SAID MAY BE DOUBTED AND LOOKED AT IN ANOTHER
POINT OF VIEW WHETHER THE SCHEME IF EVER SO PRACTICABLE WOULD BE FOR
THE BEST IS ALSO DOUBTFUL
HENCE I FEEL A RELUCTANCE TO APPROACH THE
SUBJECT LEST OUR ASPIRATION MY DEAR FRIEND SHOULD TURN OUT TO BE A
DREAM ONLY
FEAR NOT HE REPLIED FOR YOUR AUDIENCE WILL NOT BE HARD UPON YOU THEY
ARE NOT SCEPTICAL OR HOSTILE
I SAID MY GOOD FRIEND I SUPPOSE THAT YOU MEAN TO ENCOURAGE ME BY THESE
WORDS
YES HE SAID
THEN LET ME TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE DOING JUST THE REVERSE THE
ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH YOU OFFER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL VERY WELL HAD I MYSELF
BELIEVED THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT TO DECLARE THE TRUTH
ABOUT MATTERS OF HIGH INTEREST WHICH A MAN HONOURS AND LOVES AMONG WISE
MEN WHO LOVE HIM NEED OCCASION NO FEAR OR FALTERING IN HIS MIND BUT TO
CARRY ON AN ARGUMENT WHEN YOU ARE YOURSELF ONLY A HESITATING ENQUIRER
WHICH IS MY CONDITION IS A DANGEROUS AND SLIPPERY THING AND THE DANGER
IS NOT THAT I SHALL BE LAUGHED AT OF WHICH THE FEAR WOULD BE CHILDISH
BUT THAT I SHALL MISS THE TRUTH WHERE I HAVE MOST NEED TO BE SURE OF MY
FOOTING AND DRAG MY FRIENDS AFTER ME IN MY FALL
AND I PRAY NEMESIS NOT
TO VISIT UPON ME THE WORDS WHICH I AM GOING TO UTTER
FOR I DO INDEED
BELIEVE THAT TO BE AN INVOLUNTARY HOMICIDE IS A LESS CRIME THAN TO BE A
DECEIVER ABOUT BEAUTY OR GOODNESS OR JUSTICE IN THE MATTER OF LAWS
AND THAT IS A RISK WHICH I WOULD RATHER RUN AMONG ENEMIES THAN AMONG
FRIENDS AND THEREFORE YOU DO WELL TO ENCOURAGE ME
GLAUCON LAUGHED AND SAID WELL THEN SOCRATES IN CASE YOU AND YOUR
ARGUMENT DO US ANY SERIOUS INJURY YOU SHALL BE ACQUITTED BEFOREHAND OF
THE HOMICIDE AND SHALL NOT BE HELD TO BE A DECEIVER TAKE COURAGE THEN
AND SPEAK
WELL I SAID THE LAW SAYS THAT WHEN A MAN IS ACQUITTED HE IS FREE FROM
GUILT AND WHAT HOLDS AT LAW MAY HOLD IN ARGUMENT
THEN WHY SHOULD YOU MIND
WELL I REPLIED I SUPPOSE THAT I MUST RETRACE MY STEPS AND SAY WHAT I
PERHAPS OUGHT TO HAVE SAID BEFORE IN THE PROPER PLACE
THE PART OF THE
MEN HAS BEEN PLAYED OUT AND NOW PROPERLY ENOUGH COMES THE TURN OF THE
WOMEN
OF THEM I WILL PROCEED TO SPEAK AND THE MORE READILY SINCE I AM
INVITED BY YOU
FOR MEN BORN AND EDUCATED LIKE OUR CITIZENS THE ONLY WAY IN MY
OPINION OF ARRIVING AT A RIGHT CONCLUSION ABOUT THE POSSESSION AND
USE OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IS TO FOLLOW THE PATH ON WHICH WE ORIGINALLY
STARTED WHEN WE SAID THAT THE MEN WERE TO BE THE GUARDIANS AND
WATCHDOGS OF THE HERD
TRUE
LET US FURTHER SUPPOSE THE BIRTH AND EDUCATION OF OUR WOMEN TO BE
SUBJECT TO SIMILAR OR NEARLY SIMILAR REGULATIONS THEN WE SHALL SEE
WHETHER THE RESULT ACCORDS WITH OUR DESIGN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHAT I MEAN MAY BE PUT INTO THE FORM OF A QUESTION I SAID ARE DOGS
DIVIDED INTO HES AND SHES OR DO THEY BOTH SHARE EQUALLY IN HUNTING AND
IN KEEPING WATCH AND IN THE OTHER DUTIES OF DOGS OR DO WE ENTRUST TO
THE MALES THE ENTIRE AND EXCLUSIVE CARE OF THE FLOCKS WHILE WE LEAVE
THE FEMALES AT HOME UNDER THE IDEA THAT THE BEARING AND SUCKLING THEIR
PUPPIES IS LABOUR ENOUGH FOR THEM
NO HE SAID THEY SHARE ALIKE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS THAT
THE MALES ARE STRONGER AND THE FEMALES WEAKER
BUT CAN YOU USE DIFFERENT ANIMALS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE UNLESS THEY ARE
BRED AND FED IN THE SAME WAY
YOU CANNOT
THEN IF WOMEN ARE TO HAVE THE SAME DUTIES AS MEN THEY MUST HAVE THE
SAME NURTURE AND EDUCATION
YES
THE EDUCATION WHICH WAS ASSIGNED TO THE MEN WAS MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC
YES
THEN WOMEN MUST BE TAUGHT MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC AND ALSO THE ART OF WAR
WHICH THEY MUST PRACTISE LIKE THE MEN
THAT IS THE INFERENCE I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD RATHER EXPECT I SAID THAT SEVERAL OF OUR PROPOSALS IF THEY
ARE CARRIED OUT BEING UNUSUAL MAY APPEAR RIDICULOUS
NO DOUBT OF IT
YES AND THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING OF ALL WILL BE THE SIGHT OF WOMEN
NAKED IN THE PALAESTRA EXERCISING WITH THE MEN ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY
ARE NO LONGER YOUNG THEY CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE A VISION OF BEAUTY ANY
MORE THAN THE ENTHUSIASTIC OLD MEN WHO IN SPITE OF WRINKLES AND UGLINESS
CONTINUE TO FREQUENT THE GYMNASIA
YES INDEED HE SAID ACCORDING TO PRESENT NOTIONS THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE
THOUGHT RIDICULOUS
BUT THEN I SAID AS WE HAVE DETERMINED TO SPEAK OUR MINDS WE MUST NOT
FEAR THE JESTS OF THE WITS WHICH WILL BE DIRECTED AGAINST THIS SORT OF
INNOVATION HOW THEY WILL TALK OF WOMEN'S ATTAINMENTS BOTH IN MUSIC
AND GYMNASTIC AND ABOVE ALL ABOUT THEIR WEARING ARMOUR AND RIDING UPON
HORSEBACK
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
YET HAVING BEGUN WE MUST GO FORWARD TO THE ROUGH PLACES OF THE LAW AT
THE SAME TIME BEGGING OF THESE GENTLEMEN FOR ONCE IN THEIR LIFE TO BE
SERIOUS
NOT LONG AGO AS WE SHALL REMIND THEM THE HELLENES WERE OF THE
OPINION WHICH IS STILL GENERALLY RECEIVED AMONG THE BARBARIANS THAT
THE SIGHT OF A NAKED MAN WAS RIDICULOUS AND IMPROPER AND WHEN FIRST THE
CRETANS AND THEN THE LACEDAEMONIANS INTRODUCED THE CUSTOM THE WITS OF
THAT DAY MIGHT EQUALLY HAVE RIDICULED THE INNOVATION
NO DOUBT
BUT WHEN EXPERIENCE SHOWED THAT TO LET ALL THINGS BE UNCOVERED WAS FAR
BETTER THAN TO COVER THEM UP AND THE LUDICROUS EFFECT TO THE OUTWARD
EYE VANISHED BEFORE THE BETTER PRINCIPLE WHICH REASON ASSERTED THEN THE
MAN WAS PERCEIVED TO BE A FOOL WHO DIRECTS THE SHAFTS OF HIS RIDICULE
AT ANY OTHER SIGHT BUT THAT OF FOLLY AND VICE OR SERIOUSLY INCLINES TO
WEIGH THE BEAUTIFUL BY ANY OTHER STANDARD BUT THAT OF THE GOOD
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
FIRST THEN WHETHER THE QUESTION IS TO BE PUT IN JEST OR IN EARNEST
LET US COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE NATURE OF WOMAN IS SHE
CAPABLE OF SHARING EITHER WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY IN THE ACTIONS OF MEN OR
NOT AT ALL AND IS THE ART OF WAR ONE OF THOSE ARTS IN WHICH SHE CAN OR
CAN NOT SHARE THAT WILL BE THE BEST WAY OF COMMENCING THE ENQUIRY AND
WILL PROBABLY LEAD TO THE FAIREST CONCLUSION
THAT WILL BE MUCH THE BEST WAY
SHALL WE TAKE THE OTHER SIDE FIRST AND BEGIN BY ARGUING AGAINST
OURSELVES IN THIS MANNER THE ADVERSARY'S POSITION WILL NOT BE
UNDEFENDED
WHY NOT HE SAID
THEN LET US PUT A SPEECH INTO THE MOUTHS OF OUR OPPONENTS
THEY WILL
SAY 'SOCRATES AND GLAUCON NO ADVERSARY NEED CONVICT YOU FOR YOU
YOURSELVES AT THE FIRST FOUNDATION OF THE STATE ADMITTED THE PRINCIPLE
THAT EVERYBODY WAS TO DO THE ONE WORK SUITED TO HIS OWN NATURE AND
CERTAINLY IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN SUCH AN ADMISSION WAS MADE BY US
'AND
DO NOT THE NATURES OF MEN AND WOMEN DIFFER VERY MUCH INDEED AND WE
SHALL REPLY OF COURSE THEY DO
THEN WE SHALL BE ASKED 'WHETHER THE
TASKS ASSIGNED TO MEN AND TO WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE DIFFERENT AND SUCH AS
ARE AGREEABLE TO THEIR DIFFERENT NATURES CERTAINLY THEY SHOULD
'BUT
IF SO HAVE YOU NOT FALLEN INTO A SERIOUS INCONSISTENCY IN SAYING THAT
MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE NATURES ARE SO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OUGHT TO PERFORM
THE SAME ACTIONS WHAT DEFENCE WILL YOU MAKE FOR US MY GOOD SIR
AGAINST ANY ONE WHO OFFERS THESE OBJECTIONS
THAT IS NOT AN EASY QUESTION TO ANSWER WHEN ASKED SUDDENLY AND I SHALL
AND I DO BEG OF YOU TO DRAW OUT THE CASE ON OUR SIDE
THESE ARE THE OBJECTIONS GLAUCON AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS OF A LIKE
KIND WHICH I FORESAW LONG AGO THEY MADE ME AFRAID AND RELUCTANT TO
TAKE IN HAND ANY LAW ABOUT THE POSSESSION AND NURTURE OF WOMEN AND
CHILDREN
BY ZEUS HE SAID THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED IS ANYTHING BUT EASY
WHY YES I SAID BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHEN A MAN IS OUT OF HIS DEPTH
WHETHER HE HAS FALLEN INTO A LITTLE SWIMMING BATH OR INTO MID OCEAN HE
HAS TO SWIM ALL THE SAME
VERY TRUE
AND MUST NOT WE SWIM AND TRY TO REACH THE SHORE WE WILL HOPE THAT
ARION'S DOLPHIN OR SOME OTHER MIRACULOUS HELP MAY SAVE US
I SUPPOSE SO HE SAID
WELL THEN LET US SEE IF ANY WAY OF ESCAPE CAN BE FOUND
WE
ACKNOWLEDGED DID WE NOT THAT DIFFERENT NATURES OUGHT TO HAVE DIFFERENT
PURSUITS AND THAT MEN'S AND WOMEN'S NATURES ARE DIFFERENT
AND NOW
WHAT ARE WE SAYING THAT DIFFERENT NATURES OUGHT TO HAVE THE SAME
PURSUITS THIS IS THE INCONSISTENCY WHICH IS CHARGED UPON US
PRECISELY
VERILY GLAUCON I SAID GLORIOUS IS THE POWER OF THE ART OF
CONTRADICTION
WHY DO YOU SAY SO
BECAUSE I THINK THAT MANY A MAN FALLS INTO THE PRACTICE AGAINST HIS
WILL
WHEN HE THINKS THAT HE IS REASONING HE IS REALLY DISPUTING JUST
BECAUSE HE CANNOT DEFINE AND DIVIDE AND SO KNOW THAT OF WHICH HE IS
SPEAKING AND HE WILL PURSUE A MERELY VERBAL OPPOSITION IN THE SPIRIT OF
CONTENTION AND NOT OF FAIR DISCUSSION
YES HE REPLIED SUCH IS VERY OFTEN THE CASE BUT WHAT HAS THAT TO DO
WITH US AND OUR ARGUMENT
A GREAT DEAL FOR THERE IS CERTAINLY A DANGER OF OUR GETTING
UNINTENTIONALLY INTO A VERBAL OPPOSITION
IN WHAT WAY
WHY WE VALIANTLY AND PUGNACIOUSLY INSIST UPON THE VERBAL TRUTH THAT
DIFFERENT NATURES OUGHT TO HAVE DIFFERENT PURSUITS BUT WE NEVER
CONSIDERED AT ALL WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF SAMENESS OR DIFFERENCE OF
NATURE OR WHY WE DISTINGUISHED THEM WHEN WE ASSIGNED DIFFERENT PURSUITS
TO DIFFERENT NATURES AND THE SAME TO THE SAME NATURES
WHY NO HE SAID THAT WAS NEVER CONSIDERED BY US
I SAID SUPPOSE THAT BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION WE WERE TO ASK THE QUESTION
WHETHER THERE IS NOT AN OPPOSITION IN NATURE BETWEEN BALD MEN AND HAIRY
MEN AND IF THIS IS ADMITTED BY US THEN IF BALD MEN ARE COBBLERS WE
SHOULD FORBID THE HAIRY MEN TO BE COBBLERS AND CONVERSELY
THAT WOULD BE A JEST HE SAID
YES I SAID A JEST AND WHY BECAUSE WE NEVER MEANT WHEN WE CONSTRUCTED
THE STATE THAT THE OPPOSITION OF NATURES SHOULD EXTEND TO EVERY
DIFFERENCE BUT ONLY TO THOSE DIFFERENCES WHICH AFFECTED THE PURSUIT
IN WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS ENGAGED WE SHOULD HAVE ARGUED FOR EXAMPLE
THAT A PHYSICIAN AND ONE WHO IS IN MIND A PHYSICIAN MAY BE SAID TO HAVE
THE SAME NATURE
TRUE
WHEREAS THE PHYSICIAN AND THE CARPENTER HAVE DIFFERENT NATURES
CERTAINLY
AND IF I SAID THE MALE AND FEMALE SEX APPEAR TO DIFFER IN THEIR
FITNESS FOR ANY ART OR PURSUIT WE SHOULD SAY THAT SUCH PURSUIT OR ART
OUGHT TO BE ASSIGNED TO ONE OR THE OTHER OF THEM BUT IF THE DIFFERENCE
CONSISTS ONLY IN WOMEN BEARING AND MEN BEGETTING CHILDREN THIS DOES NOT
AMOUNT TO A PROOF THAT A WOMAN DIFFERS FROM A MAN IN RESPECT OF THE
SORT OF EDUCATION SHE SHOULD RECEIVE AND WE SHALL THEREFORE CONTINUE
TO MAINTAIN THAT OUR GUARDIANS AND THEIR WIVES OUGHT TO HAVE THE SAME
PURSUITS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
NEXT WE SHALL ASK OUR OPPONENT HOW IN REFERENCE TO ANY OF THE PURSUITS
OR ARTS OF CIVIC LIFE THE NATURE OF A WOMAN DIFFERS FROM THAT OF A MAN
THAT WILL BE QUITE FAIR
AND PERHAPS HE LIKE YOURSELF WILL REPLY THAT TO GIVE A SUFFICIENT
ANSWER ON THE INSTANT IS NOT EASY BUT AFTER A LITTLE REFLECTION THERE
IS NO DIFFICULTY
YES PERHAPS
SUPPOSE THEN THAT WE INVITE HIM TO ACCOMPANY US IN THE ARGUMENT AND
THEN WE MAY HOPE TO SHOW HIM THAT THERE IS NOTHING PECULIAR IN THE
CONSTITUTION OF WOMEN WHICH WOULD AFFECT THEM IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF
THE STATE
BY ALL MEANS
LET US SAY TO HIM COME NOW AND WE WILL ASK YOU A QUESTION WHEN YOU
SPOKE OF A NATURE GIFTED OR NOT GIFTED IN ANY RESPECT DID YOU MEAN TO
SAY THAT ONE MAN WILL ACQUIRE A THING EASILY ANOTHER WITH DIFFICULTY A
LITTLE LEARNING WILL LEAD THE ONE TO DISCOVER A GREAT DEAL WHEREAS
THE OTHER AFTER MUCH STUDY AND APPLICATION NO SOONER LEARNS THAN HE
FORGETS OR AGAIN DID YOU MEAN THAT THE ONE HAS A BODY WHICH IS A
GOOD SERVANT TO HIS MIND WHILE THE BODY OF THE OTHER IS A HINDRANCE TO
HIM WOULD NOT THESE BE THE SORT OF DIFFERENCES WHICH DISTINGUISH THE
MAN GIFTED BY NATURE FROM THE ONE WHO IS UNGIFTED
NO ONE WILL DENY THAT
AND CAN YOU MENTION ANY PURSUIT OF MANKIND IN WHICH THE MALE SEX HAS NOT
ALL THESE GIFTS AND QUALITIES IN A HIGHER DEGREE THAN THE FEMALE NEED
I WASTE TIME IN SPEAKING OF THE ART OF WEAVING AND THE MANAGEMENT OF
PANCAKES AND PRESERVES IN WHICH WOMANKIND DOES REALLY APPEAR TO BE
GREAT AND IN WHICH FOR HER TO BE BEATEN BY A MAN IS OF ALL THINGS THE
MOST ABSURD
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT HE REPLIED IN MAINTAINING THE GENERAL INFERIORITY
OF THE FEMALE SEX ALTHOUGH MANY WOMEN ARE IN MANY THINGS SUPERIOR TO
MANY MEN YET ON THE WHOLE WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE
AND IF SO MY FRIEND I SAID THERE IS NO SPECIAL FACULTY OF
ADMINISTRATION IN A STATE WHICH A WOMAN HAS BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN OR
WHICH A MAN HAS BY VIRTUE OF HIS SEX BUT THE GIFTS OF NATURE ARE ALIKE
DIFFUSED IN BOTH ALL THE PURSUITS OF MEN ARE THE PURSUITS OF WOMEN
ALSO BUT IN ALL OF THEM A WOMAN IS INFERIOR TO A MAN
VERY TRUE
THEN ARE WE TO IMPOSE ALL OUR ENACTMENTS ON MEN AND NONE OF THEM ON
WOMEN
THAT WILL NEVER DO
ONE WOMAN HAS A GIFT OF HEALING ANOTHER NOT ONE IS A MUSICIAN AND
ANOTHER HAS NO MUSIC IN HER NATURE
VERY TRUE
AND ONE WOMAN HAS A TURN FOR GYMNASTIC AND MILITARY EXERCISES AND
ANOTHER IS UNWARLIKE AND HATES GYMNASTICS
CERTAINLY
AND ONE WOMAN IS A PHILOSOPHER AND ANOTHER IS AN ENEMY OF PHILOSOPHY
ONE HAS SPIRIT AND ANOTHER IS WITHOUT SPIRIT
THAT IS ALSO TRUE
THEN ONE WOMAN WILL HAVE THE TEMPER OF A GUARDIAN AND ANOTHER NOT
WAS
NOT THE SELECTION OF THE MALE GUARDIANS DETERMINED BY DIFFERENCES OF
THIS SORT
YES
MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE POSSESS THE QUALITIES WHICH MAKE A GUARDIAN THEY
DIFFER ONLY IN THEIR COMPARATIVE STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS
OBVIOUSLY
AND THOSE WOMEN WHO HAVE SUCH QUALITIES ARE TO BE SELECTED AS THE
COMPANIONS AND COLLEAGUES OF MEN WHO HAVE SIMILAR QUALITIES AND WHOM
THEY RESEMBLE IN CAPACITY AND IN CHARACTER
VERY TRUE
AND OUGHT NOT THE SAME NATURES TO HAVE THE SAME PURSUITS
THEY OUGHT
THEN AS WE WERE SAYING BEFORE THERE IS NOTHING UNNATURAL IN ASSIGNING
MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC TO THE WIVES OF THE GUARDIANS TO THAT POINT WE COME
ROUND AGAIN
CERTAINLY NOT
THE LAW WHICH WE THEN ENACTED WAS AGREEABLE TO NATURE AND THEREFORE NOT
AN IMPOSSIBILITY OR MERE ASPIRATION AND THE CONTRARY PRACTICE WHICH
PREVAILS AT PRESENT IS IN REALITY A VIOLATION OF NATURE
THAT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
WE HAD TO CONSIDER FIRST WHETHER OUR PROPOSALS WERE POSSIBLE AND
SECONDLY WHETHER THEY WERE THE MOST BENEFICIAL
YES
AND THE POSSIBILITY HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED
YES
THE VERY GREAT BENEFIT HAS NEXT TO BE ESTABLISHED
QUITE SO
YOU WILL ADMIT THAT THE SAME EDUCATION WHICH MAKES A MAN A GOOD GUARDIAN
WILL MAKE A WOMAN A GOOD GUARDIAN FOR THEIR ORIGINAL NATURE IS THE
SAME
YES
I SHOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION
WHAT IS IT
WOULD YOU SAY THAT ALL MEN ARE EQUAL IN EXCELLENCE OR IS ONE MAN BETTER
THAN ANOTHER
THE LATTER
AND IN THE COMMONWEALTH WHICH WE WERE FOUNDING DO YOU CONCEIVE THE
GUARDIANS WHO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ON OUR MODEL SYSTEM TO BE MORE
PERFECT MEN OR THE COBBLERS WHOSE EDUCATION HAS BEEN COBBLING
WHAT A RIDICULOUS QUESTION
YOU HAVE ANSWERED ME I REPLIED WELL AND MAY WE NOT FURTHER SAY THAT
OUR GUARDIANS ARE THE BEST OF OUR CITIZENS
BY FAR THE BEST
AND WILL NOT THEIR WIVES BE THE BEST WOMEN
YES BY FAR THE BEST
AND CAN THERE BE ANYTHING BETTER FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE THAN
THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF A STATE SHOULD BE AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE
THERE CAN BE NOTHING BETTER
AND THIS IS WHAT THE ARTS OF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC WHEN PRESENT IN SUCH
MANNER AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED WILL ACCOMPLISH
CERTAINLY
THEN WE HAVE MADE AN ENACTMENT NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT IN THE HIGHEST
DEGREE BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE
TRUE
THEN LET THE WIVES OF OUR GUARDIANS STRIP FOR THEIR VIRTUE WILL BE
THEIR ROBE AND LET THEM SHARE IN THE TOILS OF WAR AND THE DEFENCE OF
THEIR COUNTRY ONLY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF LABOURS THE LIGHTER ARE TO BE
ASSIGNED TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE THE WEAKER NATURES BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS
THEIR DUTIES ARE TO BE THE SAME
AND AS FOR THE MAN WHO LAUGHS AT NAKED
WOMEN EXERCISING THEIR BODIES FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES IN HIS LAUGHTER
HE IS PLUCKING
'A FRUIT OF UNRIPE WISDOM
AND HE HIMSELF IS IGNORANT OF WHAT HE IS LAUGHING AT OR WHAT HE IS
ABOUT FOR THAT IS AND EVER WILL BE THE BEST OF SAYINGS THAT THE
USEFUL IS THE NOBLE AND THE HURTFUL IS THE BASE
VERY TRUE
HERE THEN IS ONE DIFFICULTY IN OUR LAW ABOUT WOMEN WHICH WE MAY SAY
THAT WE HAVE NOW ESCAPED THE WAVE HAS NOT SWALLOWED US UP ALIVE FOR
ENACTING THAT THE GUARDIANS OF EITHER SEX SHOULD HAVE ALL THEIR
PURSUITS IN COMMON TO THE UTILITY AND ALSO TO THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS
ARRANGEMENT THE CONSISTENCY OF THE ARGUMENT WITH ITSELF BEARS WITNESS
YES THAT WAS A MIGHTY WAVE WHICH YOU HAVE ESCAPED
YES I SAID BUT A GREATER IS COMING YOU WILL NOT THINK MUCH OF THIS
WHEN YOU SEE THE NEXT
GO ON LET ME SEE
THE LAW I SAID WHICH IS THE SEQUEL OF THIS AND OF ALL THAT HAS
PRECEDED IS TO THE FOLLOWING EFFECT 'THAT THE WIVES OF OUR GUARDIANS
ARE TO BE COMMON AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE TO BE COMMON AND NO PARENT IS
TO KNOW HIS OWN CHILD NOR ANY CHILD HIS PARENT
YES HE SAID THAT IS A MUCH GREATER WAVE THAN THE OTHER AND
THE POSSIBILITY AS WELL AS THE UTILITY OF SUCH A LAW ARE FAR MORE
QUESTIONABLE
I DO NOT THINK I SAID THAT THERE CAN BE ANY DISPUTE ABOUT THE VERY
GREAT UTILITY OF HAVING WIVES AND CHILDREN IN COMMON THE POSSIBILITY IS
QUITE ANOTHER MATTER AND WILL BE VERY MUCH DISPUTED
I THINK THAT A GOOD MANY DOUBTS MAY BE RAISED ABOUT BOTH
YOU IMPLY THAT THE TWO QUESTIONS MUST BE COMBINED I REPLIED
NOW I
MEANT THAT YOU SHOULD ADMIT THE UTILITY AND IN THIS WAY AS I THOUGHT
I SHOULD ESCAPE FROM ONE OF THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD REMAIN ONLY THE
POSSIBILITY
BUT THAT LITTLE ATTEMPT IS DETECTED AND THEREFORE YOU WILL PLEASE TO
GIVE A DEFENCE OF BOTH
WELL I SAID I SUBMIT TO MY FATE
YET GRANT ME A LITTLE FAVOUR LET
ME FEAST MY MIND WITH THE DREAM AS DAY DREAMERS ARE IN THE HABIT OF
FEASTING THEMSELVES WHEN THEY ARE WALKING ALONE FOR BEFORE THEY HAVE
DISCOVERED ANY MEANS OF EFFECTING THEIR WISHES THAT IS A MATTER WHICH
NEVER TROUBLES THEM THEY WOULD RATHER NOT TIRE THEMSELVES BY THINKING
ABOUT POSSIBILITIES BUT ASSUMING THAT WHAT THEY DESIRE IS ALREADY
GRANTED TO THEM THEY PROCEED WITH THEIR PLAN AND DELIGHT IN DETAILING
WHAT THEY MEAN TO DO WHEN THEIR WISH HAS COME TRUE THAT IS A WAY WHICH
THEY HAVE OF NOT DOING MUCH GOOD TO A CAPACITY WHICH WAS NEVER GOOD FOR
MUCH
NOW I MYSELF AM BEGINNING TO LOSE HEART AND I SHOULD LIKE WITH
YOUR PERMISSION TO PASS OVER THE QUESTION OF POSSIBILITY AT PRESENT
ASSUMING THEREFORE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE PROPOSAL I SHALL NOW PROCEED
TO ENQUIRE HOW THE RULERS WILL CARRY OUT THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND I SHALL
DEMONSTRATE THAT OUR PLAN IF EXECUTED WILL BE OF THE GREATEST BENEFIT
TO THE STATE AND TO THE GUARDIANS
FIRST OF ALL THEN IF YOU HAVE NO
OBJECTION I WILL ENDEAVOUR WITH YOUR HELP TO CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF
THE MEASURE AND HEREAFTER THE QUESTION OF POSSIBILITY
I HAVE NO OBJECTION PROCEED
FIRST I THINK THAT IF OUR RULERS AND THEIR AUXILIARIES ARE TO BE WORTHY
OF THE NAME WHICH THEY BEAR THERE MUST BE WILLINGNESS TO OBEY IN THE
ONE AND THE POWER OF COMMAND IN THE OTHER THE GUARDIANS MUST THEMSELVES
OBEY THE LAWS AND THEY MUST ALSO IMITATE THE SPIRIT OF THEM IN ANY
DETAILS WHICH ARE ENTRUSTED TO THEIR CARE
THAT IS RIGHT HE SAID
YOU I SAID WHO ARE THEIR LEGISLATOR HAVING SELECTED THE MEN WILL NOW
SELECT THE WOMEN AND GIVE THEM TO THEM THEY MUST BE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
OF LIKE NATURES WITH THEM AND THEY MUST LIVE IN COMMON HOUSES AND MEET
AT COMMON MEALS
NONE OF THEM WILL HAVE ANYTHING SPECIALLY HIS OR HER
OWN THEY WILL BE TOGETHER AND WILL BE BROUGHT UP TOGETHER AND
WILL ASSOCIATE AT GYMNASTIC EXERCISES
AND SO THEY WILL BE DRAWN BY
A NECESSITY OF THEIR NATURES TO HAVE INTERCOURSE WITH EACH
OTHER NECESSITY IS NOT TOO STRONG A WORD I THINK
YES HE SAID NECESSITY NOT GEOMETRICAL BUT ANOTHER SORT OF NECESSITY
WHICH LOVERS KNOW AND WHICH IS FAR MORE CONVINCING AND CONSTRAINING TO
THE MASS OF MANKIND
TRUE I SAID AND THIS GLAUCON LIKE ALL THE REST MUST PROCEED AFTER
AN ORDERLY FASHION IN A CITY OF THE BLESSED LICENTIOUSNESS IS AN
UNHOLY THING WHICH THE RULERS WILL FORBID
YES HE SAID AND IT OUGHT NOT TO BE PERMITTED
THEN CLEARLY THE NEXT THING WILL BE TO MAKE MATRIMONY SACRED IN THE
HIGHEST DEGREE AND WHAT IS MOST BENEFICIAL WILL BE DEEMED SACRED
EXACTLY
AND HOW CAN MARRIAGES BE MADE MOST BENEFICIAL THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH
I PUT TO YOU BECAUSE I SEE IN YOUR HOUSE DOGS FOR HUNTING AND OF THE
NOBLER SORT OF BIRDS NOT A FEW
NOW I BESEECH YOU DO TELL ME HAVE YOU
EVER ATTENDED TO THEIR PAIRING AND BREEDING
IN WHAT PARTICULARS
WHY IN THE FIRST PLACE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ALL OF A GOOD SORT ARE NOT
SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS
TRUE
AND DO YOU BREED FROM THEM ALL INDIFFERENTLY OR DO YOU TAKE CARE TO
BREED FROM THE BEST ONLY
FROM THE BEST
AND DO YOU TAKE THE OLDEST OR THE YOUNGEST OR ONLY THOSE OF RIPE AGE
I CHOOSE ONLY THOSE OF RIPE AGE
AND IF CARE WAS NOT TAKEN IN THE BREEDING YOUR DOGS AND BIRDS WOULD
GREATLY DETERIORATE
CERTAINLY
AND THE SAME OF HORSES AND ANIMALS IN GENERAL
UNDOUBTEDLY
GOOD HEAVENS MY DEAR FRIEND I SAID WHAT CONSUMMATE SKILL WILL OUR
RULERS NEED IF THE SAME PRINCIPLE HOLDS OF THE HUMAN SPECIES
CERTAINLY THE SAME PRINCIPLE HOLDS BUT WHY DOES THIS INVOLVE ANY
PARTICULAR SKILL
BECAUSE I SAID OUR RULERS WILL OFTEN HAVE TO PRACTISE UPON THE BODY
CORPORATE WITH MEDICINES
NOW YOU KNOW THAT WHEN PATIENTS DO NOT REQUIRE
MEDICINES BUT HAVE ONLY TO BE PUT UNDER A REGIMEN THE INFERIOR SORT
OF PRACTITIONER IS DEEMED TO BE GOOD ENOUGH BUT WHEN MEDICINE HAS TO BE
GIVEN THEN THE DOCTOR SHOULD BE MORE OF A MAN
THAT IS QUITE TRUE HE SAID BUT TO WHAT ARE YOU ALLUDING
I MEAN I REPLIED THAT OUR RULERS WILL FIND A CONSIDERABLE DOSE OF
FALSEHOOD AND DECEIT NECESSARY FOR THE GOOD OF THEIR SUBJECTS WE WERE
SAYING THAT THE USE OF ALL THESE THINGS REGARDED AS MEDICINES MIGHT BE
OF ADVANTAGE
AND WE WERE VERY RIGHT
AND THIS LAWFUL USE OF THEM SEEMS LIKELY TO BE OFTEN NEEDED IN THE
REGULATIONS OF MARRIAGES AND BIRTHS
HOW SO
WHY I SAID THE PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN ALREADY LAID DOWN THAT THE BEST OF
EITHER SEX SHOULD BE UNITED WITH THE BEST AS OFTEN AND THE INFERIOR
WITH THE INFERIOR AS SELDOM AS POSSIBLE AND THAT THEY SHOULD REAR THE
OFFSPRING OF THE ONE SORT OF UNION BUT NOT OF THE OTHER IF THE FLOCK
IS TO BE MAINTAINED IN FIRST RATE CONDITION
NOW THESE GOINGS ON MUST BE
A SECRET WHICH THE RULERS ONLY KNOW OR THERE WILL BE A FURTHER
DANGER OF OUR HERD AS THE GUARDIANS MAY BE TERMED BREAKING OUT INTO
REBELLION
VERY TRUE
HAD WE NOT BETTER APPOINT CERTAIN FESTIVALS AT WHICH WE WILL BRING
TOGETHER THE BRIDES AND BRIDEGROOMS AND SACRIFICES WILL BE OFFERED AND
SUITABLE HYMENEAL SONGS COMPOSED BY OUR POETS THE NUMBER OF WEDDINGS IS
A MATTER WHICH MUST BE LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE RULERS WHOSE AIM
WILL BE TO PRESERVE THE AVERAGE OF POPULATION THERE ARE MANY OTHER
THINGS WHICH THEY WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER SUCH AS THE EFFECTS OF WARS AND
DISEASES AND ANY SIMILAR AGENCIES IN ORDER AS FAR AS THIS IS POSSIBLE
TO PREVENT THE STATE FROM BECOMING EITHER TOO LARGE OR TOO SMALL
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
WE SHALL HAVE TO INVENT SOME INGENIOUS KIND OF LOTS WHICH THE LESS
WORTHY MAY DRAW ON EACH OCCASION OF OUR BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND THEN
THEY WILL ACCUSE THEIR OWN ILL LUCK AND NOT THE RULERS
TO BE SURE HE SAID
AND I THINK THAT OUR BRAVER AND BETTER YOUTH BESIDES THEIR OTHER
HONOURS AND REWARDS MIGHT HAVE GREATER FACILITIES OF INTERCOURSE WITH
WOMEN GIVEN THEM THEIR BRAVERY WILL BE A REASON AND SUCH FATHERS OUGHT
TO HAVE AS MANY SONS AS POSSIBLE
TRUE
AND THE PROPER OFFICERS WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE OR BOTH FOR OFFICES ARE
TO BE HELD BY WOMEN AS WELL AS BY MEN
YES
THE PROPER OFFICERS WILL TAKE THE OFFSPRING OF THE GOOD PARENTS TO THE
PEN OR FOLD AND THERE THEY WILL DEPOSIT THEM WITH CERTAIN NURSES WHO
DWELL IN A SEPARATE QUARTER BUT THE OFFSPRING OF THE INFERIOR OR OF
THE BETTER WHEN THEY CHANCE TO BE DEFORMED WILL BE PUT AWAY IN SOME
MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN PLACE AS THEY SHOULD BE
YES HE SAID THAT MUST BE DONE IF THE BREED OF THE GUARDIANS IS TO BE
KEPT PURE
THEY WILL PROVIDE FOR THEIR NURTURE AND WILL BRING THE MOTHERS TO THE
FOLD WHEN THEY ARE FULL OF MILK TAKING THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE THAT
NO MOTHER RECOGNISES HER OWN CHILD AND OTHER WET NURSES MAY BE ENGAGED
IF MORE ARE REQUIRED
CARE WILL ALSO BE TAKEN THAT THE PROCESS OF
SUCKLING SHALL NOT BE PROTRACTED TOO LONG AND THE MOTHERS WILL HAVE NO
GETTING UP AT NIGHT OR OTHER TROUBLE BUT WILL HAND OVER ALL THIS SORT
OF THING TO THE NURSES AND ATTENDANTS
YOU SUPPOSE THE WIVES OF OUR GUARDIANS TO HAVE A FINE EASY TIME OF IT
WHEN THEY ARE HAVING CHILDREN
WHY SAID I AND SO THEY OUGHT
LET US HOWEVER PROCEED WITH OUR
SCHEME
WE WERE SAYING THAT THE PARENTS SHOULD BE IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
VERY TRUE
AND WHAT IS THE PRIME OF LIFE MAY IT NOT BE DEFINED AS A PERIOD OF
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS IN A WOMAN'S LIFE AND THIRTY IN A MAN'S
WHICH YEARS DO YOU MEAN TO INCLUDE
A WOMAN I SAID AT TWENTY YEARS OF AGE MAY BEGIN TO BEAR CHILDREN TO
THE STATE AND CONTINUE TO BEAR THEM UNTIL FORTY A MAN MAY BEGIN AT
FIVE AND TWENTY WHEN HE HAS PASSED THE POINT AT WHICH THE PULSE OF LIFE
BEATS QUICKEST AND CONTINUE TO BEGET CHILDREN UNTIL HE BE FIFTY FIVE
CERTAINLY HE SAID BOTH IN MEN AND WOMEN THOSE YEARS ARE THE PRIME OF
PHYSICAL AS WELL AS OF INTELLECTUAL VIGOUR
ANY ONE ABOVE OR BELOW THE PRESCRIBED AGES WHO TAKES PART IN THE PUBLIC
HYMENEALS SHALL BE SAID TO HAVE DONE AN UNHOLY AND UNRIGHTEOUS THING
THE CHILD OF WHICH HE IS THE FATHER IF IT STEALS INTO LIFE WILL HAVE
BEEN CONCEIVED UNDER AUSPICES VERY UNLIKE THE SACRIFICES AND PRAYERS
WHICH AT EACH HYMENEAL PRIESTESSES AND PRIEST AND THE WHOLE CITY WILL
OFFER THAT THE NEW GENERATION MAY BE BETTER AND MORE USEFUL THAN THEIR
GOOD AND USEFUL PARENTS WHEREAS HIS CHILD WILL BE THE OFFSPRING OF
DARKNESS AND STRANGE LUST
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
AND THE SAME LAW WILL APPLY TO ANY ONE OF THOSE WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED
AGE WHO FORMS A CONNECTION WITH ANY WOMAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE WITHOUT
THE SANCTION OF THE RULERS FOR WE SHALL SAY THAT HE IS RAISING UP A
BASTARD TO THE STATE UNCERTIFIED AND UNCONSECRATED
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
THIS APPLIES HOWEVER ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE WITHIN THE SPECIFIED AGE
AFTER THAT WE ALLOW THEM TO RANGE AT WILL EXCEPT THAT A MAN MAY NOT
MARRY HIS DAUGHTER OR HIS DAUGHTER'S DAUGHTER OR HIS MOTHER OR HIS
MOTHER'S MOTHER AND WOMEN ON THE OTHER HAND ARE PROHIBITED FROM
MARRYING THEIR SONS OR FATHERS OR SON'S SON OR FATHER'S FATHER AND
SO ON IN EITHER DIRECTION
AND WE GRANT ALL THIS ACCOMPANYING THE
PERMISSION WITH STRICT ORDERS TO PREVENT ANY EMBRYO WHICH MAY COME INTO
BEING FROM SEEING THE LIGHT AND IF ANY FORCE A WAY TO THE BIRTH THE
PARENTS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE OFFSPRING OF SUCH AN UNION CANNOT BE
MAINTAINED AND ARRANGE ACCORDINGLY
THAT ALSO HE SAID IS A REASONABLE PROPOSITION
BUT HOW WILL THEY KNOW
WHO ARE FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS AND SO ON
THEY WILL NEVER KNOW
THE WAY WILL BE THIS DATING FROM THE DAY OF THE
HYMENEAL THE BRIDEGROOM WHO WAS THEN MARRIED WILL CALL ALL THE MALE
CHILDREN WHO ARE BORN IN THE SEVENTH AND TENTH MONTH AFTERWARDS HIS
SONS AND THE FEMALE CHILDREN HIS DAUGHTERS AND THEY WILL CALL HIM
FATHER AND HE WILL CALL THEIR CHILDREN HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND THEY WILL
CALL THE ELDER GENERATION GRANDFATHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS
ALL WHO WERE
BEGOTTEN AT THE TIME WHEN THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS CAME TOGETHER WILL
BE CALLED THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THESE AS I WAS SAYING WILL
BE FORBIDDEN TO INTER MARRY
THIS HOWEVER IS NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS
AN ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION OF THE MARRIAGE OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS IF THE
LOT FAVOURS THEM AND THEY RECEIVE THE SANCTION OF THE PYTHIAN ORACLE
THE LAW WILL ALLOW THEM
QUITE RIGHT HE REPLIED
SUCH IS THE SCHEME GLAUCON ACCORDING TO WHICH THE GUARDIANS OF OUR
STATE ARE TO HAVE THEIR WIVES AND FAMILIES IN COMMON
AND NOW YOU WOULD
HAVE THE ARGUMENT SHOW THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REST
OF OUR POLITY AND ALSO THAT NOTHING CAN BE BETTER WOULD YOU NOT
YES CERTAINLY
SHALL WE TRY TO FIND A COMMON BASIS BY ASKING OF OURSELVES WHAT OUGHT
TO BE THE CHIEF AIM OF THE LEGISLATOR IN MAKING LAWS AND IN THE
ORGANIZATION OF A STATE WHAT IS THE GREATEST GOOD AND WHAT IS THE
GREATEST EVIL AND THEN CONSIDER WHETHER OUR PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION HAS
THE STAMP OF THE GOOD OR OF THE EVIL
BY ALL MEANS
CAN THERE BE ANY GREATER EVIL THAN DISCORD AND DISTRACTION AND PLURALITY
WHERE UNITY OUGHT TO REIGN OR ANY GREATER GOOD THAN THE BOND OF UNITY
THERE CANNOT
AND THERE IS UNITY WHERE THERE IS COMMUNITY OF PLEASURES AND
PAINS WHERE ALL THE CITIZENS ARE GLAD OR GRIEVED ON THE SAME OCCASIONS
OF JOY AND SORROW
NO DOUBT
YES AND WHERE THERE IS NO COMMON BUT ONLY PRIVATE FEELING A STATE IS
DISORGANIZED WHEN YOU HAVE ONE HALF OF THE WORLD TRIUMPHING AND THE
OTHER PLUNGED IN GRIEF AT THE SAME EVENTS HAPPENING TO THE CITY OR THE
CITIZENS
CERTAINLY
SUCH DIFFERENCES COMMONLY ORIGINATE IN A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE USE OF
THE TERMS 'MINE' AND 'NOT MINE 'HIS' AND 'NOT HIS
EXACTLY SO
AND IS NOT THAT THE BEST ORDERED STATE IN WHICH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF
PERSONS APPLY THE TERMS 'MINE' AND 'NOT MINE' IN THE SAME WAY TO THE
SAME THING
QUITE TRUE
OR THAT AGAIN WHICH MOST NEARLY APPROACHES TO THE CONDITION OF THE
INDIVIDUAL AS IN THE BODY WHEN BUT A FINGER OF ONE OF US IS HURT THE
WHOLE FRAME DRAWN TOWARDS THE SOUL AS A CENTRE AND FORMING ONE KINGDOM
UNDER THE RULING POWER THEREIN FEELS THE HURT AND SYMPATHIZES ALL
TOGETHER WITH THE PART AFFECTED AND WE SAY THAT THE MAN HAS A PAIN IN
HIS FINGER AND THE SAME EXPRESSION IS USED ABOUT ANY OTHER PART OF THE
BODY WHICH HAS A SENSATION OF PAIN AT SUFFERING OR OF PLEASURE AT THE
ALLEVIATION OF SUFFERING
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IN THE BEST ORDERED
STATE THERE IS THE NEAREST APPROACH TO THIS COMMON FEELING WHICH YOU
DESCRIBE
THEN WHEN ANY ONE OF THE CITIZENS EXPERIENCES ANY GOOD OR EVIL THE
WHOLE STATE WILL MAKE HIS CASE THEIR OWN AND WILL EITHER REJOICE OR
SORROW WITH HIM
YES HE SAID THAT IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN A WELL ORDERED STATE
IT WILL NOW BE TIME I SAID FOR US TO RETURN TO OUR STATE AND SEE
WHETHER THIS OR SOME OTHER FORM IS MOST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
VERY GOOD
OUR STATE LIKE EVERY OTHER HAS RULERS AND SUBJECTS
TRUE
ALL OF WHOM WILL CALL ONE ANOTHER CITIZENS
OF COURSE
BUT IS THERE NOT ANOTHER NAME WHICH PEOPLE GIVE TO THEIR RULERS IN OTHER
STATES
GENERALLY THEY CALL THEM MASTERS BUT IN DEMOCRATIC STATES THEY SIMPLY
CALL THEM RULERS
AND IN OUR STATE WHAT OTHER NAME BESIDES THAT OF CITIZENS DO THE PEOPLE
GIVE THE RULERS
THEY ARE CALLED SAVIOURS AND HELPERS HE REPLIED
AND WHAT DO THE RULERS CALL THE PEOPLE
THEIR MAINTAINERS AND FOSTER FATHERS
AND WHAT DO THEY CALL THEM IN OTHER STATES
SLAVES
AND WHAT DO THE RULERS CALL ONE ANOTHER IN OTHER STATES
FELLOW RULERS
AND WHAT IN OURS
FELLOW GUARDIANS
DID YOU EVER KNOW AN EXAMPLE IN ANY OTHER STATE OF A RULER WHO WOULD
SPEAK OF ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES AS HIS FRIEND AND OF ANOTHER AS NOT BEING
HIS FRIEND
YES VERY OFTEN
AND THE FRIEND HE REGARDS AND DESCRIBES AS ONE IN WHOM HE HAS AN
INTEREST AND THE OTHER AS A STRANGER IN WHOM HE HAS NO INTEREST
EXACTLY
BUT WOULD ANY OF YOUR GUARDIANS THINK OR SPEAK OF ANY OTHER GUARDIAN AS
A STRANGER
CERTAINLY HE WOULD NOT FOR EVERY ONE WHOM THEY MEET WILL BE REGARDED
BY THEM EITHER AS A BROTHER OR SISTER OR FATHER OR MOTHER OR SON OR
DAUGHTER OR AS THE CHILD OR PARENT OF THOSE WHO ARE THUS CONNECTED WITH
HIM
CAPITAL I SAID BUT LET ME ASK YOU ONCE MORE SHALL THEY BE A FAMILY IN
NAME ONLY OR SHALL THEY IN ALL THEIR ACTIONS BE TRUE TO THE NAME FOR
EXAMPLE IN THE USE OF THE WORD 'FATHER WOULD THE CARE OF A FATHER BE
IMPLIED AND THE FILIAL REVERENCE AND DUTY AND OBEDIENCE TO HIM WHICH THE
LAW COMMANDS AND IS THE VIOLATOR OF THESE DUTIES TO BE REGARDED AS AN
IMPIOUS AND UNRIGHTEOUS PERSON WHO IS NOT LIKELY TO RECEIVE MUCH GOOD
EITHER AT THE HANDS OF GOD OR OF MAN ARE THESE TO BE OR NOT TO BE THE
STRAINS WHICH THE CHILDREN WILL HEAR REPEATED IN THEIR EARS BY ALL THE
CITIZENS ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE INTIMATED TO THEM TO BE THEIR PARENTS AND
THE REST OF THEIR KINSFOLK
THESE HE SAID AND NONE OTHER FOR WHAT CAN BE MORE RIDICULOUS THAN FOR
THEM TO UTTER THE NAMES OF FAMILY TIES WITH THE LIPS ONLY AND NOT TO ACT
IN THE SPIRIT OF THEM
THEN IN OUR CITY THE LANGUAGE OF HARMONY AND CONCORD WILL BE MORE OFTEN
HEARD THAN IN ANY OTHER
AS I WAS DESCRIBING BEFORE WHEN ANY ONE IS
WELL OR ILL THE UNIVERSAL WORD WILL BE 'WITH ME IT IS WELL' OR 'IT IS
ILL
MOST TRUE
AND AGREEABLY TO THIS MODE OF THINKING AND SPEAKING WERE WE NOT SAYING
THAT THEY WILL HAVE THEIR PLEASURES AND PAINS IN COMMON
YES AND SO THEY WILL
AND THEY WILL HAVE A COMMON INTEREST IN THE SAME THING WHICH THEY WILL
ALIKE CALL 'MY OWN AND HAVING THIS COMMON INTEREST THEY WILL HAVE A
COMMON FEELING OF PLEASURE AND PAIN
YES FAR MORE SO THAN IN OTHER STATES
AND THE REASON OF THIS OVER AND ABOVE THE GENERAL CONSTITUTION OF THE
STATE WILL BE THAT THE GUARDIANS WILL HAVE A COMMUNITY OF WOMEN AND
CHILDREN
THAT WILL BE THE CHIEF REASON
AND THIS UNITY OF FEELING WE ADMITTED TO BE THE GREATEST GOOD AS WAS
IMPLIED IN OUR OWN COMPARISON OF A WELL ORDERED STATE TO THE RELATION OF
THE BODY AND THE MEMBERS WHEN AFFECTED BY PLEASURE OR PAIN
THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGED AND VERY RIGHTLY
THEN THE COMMUNITY OF WIVES AND CHILDREN AMONG OUR CITIZENS IS CLEARLY
THE SOURCE OF THE GREATEST GOOD TO THE STATE
CERTAINLY
AND THIS AGREES WITH THE OTHER PRINCIPLE WHICH WE WERE AFFIRMING THAT
THE GUARDIANS WERE NOT TO HAVE HOUSES OR LANDS OR ANY OTHER PROPERTY
THEIR PAY WAS TO BE THEIR FOOD WHICH THEY WERE TO RECEIVE FROM THE
OTHER CITIZENS AND THEY WERE TO HAVE NO PRIVATE EXPENSES FOR WE
INTENDED THEM TO PRESERVE THEIR TRUE CHARACTER OF GUARDIANS
RIGHT HE REPLIED
BOTH THE COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY AND THE COMMUNITY OF FAMILIES AS I AM
SAYING TEND TO MAKE THEM MORE TRULY GUARDIANS THEY WILL NOT TEAR
THE CITY IN PIECES BY DIFFERING ABOUT 'MINE' AND 'NOT MINE EACH MAN
DRAGGING ANY ACQUISITION WHICH HE HAS MADE INTO A SEPARATE HOUSE OF HIS
OWN WHERE HE HAS A SEPARATE WIFE AND CHILDREN AND PRIVATE PLEASURES AND
PAINS BUT ALL WILL BE AFFECTED AS FAR AS MAY BE BY THE SAME PLEASURES
AND PAINS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL OF ONE OPINION ABOUT WHAT IS NEAR AND
DEAR TO THEM AND THEREFORE THEY ALL TEND TOWARDS A COMMON END
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
AND AS THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT THEIR PERSONS WHICH THEY CAN CALL THEIR
OWN SUITS AND COMPLAINTS WILL HAVE NO EXISTENCE AMONG THEM THEY WILL
BE DELIVERED FROM ALL THOSE QUARRELS OF WHICH MONEY OR CHILDREN OR
RELATIONS ARE THE OCCASION
OF COURSE THEY WILL
NEITHER WILL TRIALS FOR ASSAULT OR INSULT EVER BE LIKELY TO OCCUR AMONG
THEM
FOR THAT EQUALS SHOULD DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST EQUALS WE SHALL
MAINTAIN TO BE HONOURABLE AND RIGHT WE SHALL MAKE THE PROTECTION OF THE
PERSON A MATTER OF NECESSITY
THAT IS GOOD HE SAID
YES AND THERE IS A FURTHER GOOD IN THE LAW VIZ
THAT IF A MAN HAS A
QUARREL WITH ANOTHER HE WILL SATISFY HIS RESENTMENT THEN AND THERE AND
NOT PROCEED TO MORE DANGEROUS LENGTHS
CERTAINLY
TO THE ELDER SHALL BE ASSIGNED THE DUTY OF RULING AND CHASTISING THE
YOUNGER
CLEARLY
NOR CAN THERE BE A DOUBT THAT THE YOUNGER WILL NOT STRIKE OR DO ANY
OTHER VIOLENCE TO AN ELDER UNLESS THE MAGISTRATES COMMAND HIM NOR WILL
HE SLIGHT HIM IN ANY WAY
FOR THERE ARE TWO GUARDIANS SHAME AND FEAR
MIGHTY TO PREVENT HIM SHAME WHICH MAKES MEN REFRAIN FROM LAYING HANDS
ON THOSE WHO ARE TO THEM IN THE RELATION OF PARENTS FEAR THAT THE
INJURED ONE WILL BE SUCCOURED BY THE OTHERS WHO ARE HIS BROTHERS SONS
FATHERS
THAT IS TRUE HE REPLIED
THEN IN EVERY WAY THE LAWS WILL HELP THE CITIZENS TO KEEP THE PEACE WITH
ONE ANOTHER
YES THERE WILL BE NO WANT OF PEACE
AND AS THE GUARDIANS WILL NEVER QUARREL AMONG THEMSELVES THERE WILL BE
NO DANGER OF THE REST OF THE CITY BEING DIVIDED EITHER AGAINST THEM OR
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER
NONE WHATEVER
I HARDLY LIKE EVEN TO MENTION THE LITTLE MEANNESSES OF WHICH THEY WILL
BE RID FOR THEY ARE BENEATH NOTICE SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS THE
FLATTERY OF THE RICH BY THE POOR AND ALL THE PAINS AND PANGS WHICH
MEN EXPERIENCE IN BRINGING UP A FAMILY AND IN FINDING MONEY TO BUY
NECESSARIES FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLD BORROWING AND THEN REPUDIATING GETTING
HOW THEY CAN AND GIVING THE MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF WOMEN AND SLAVES
TO KEEP THE MANY EVILS OF SO MANY KINDS WHICH PEOPLE SUFFER IN THIS WAY
ARE MEAN ENOUGH AND OBVIOUS ENOUGH AND NOT WORTH SPEAKING OF
YES HE SAID A MAN HAS NO NEED OF EYES IN ORDER TO PERCEIVE THAT
AND FROM ALL THESE EVILS THEY WILL BE DELIVERED AND THEIR LIFE WILL BE
BLESSED AS THE LIFE OF OLYMPIC VICTORS AND YET MORE BLESSED
HOW SO
THE OLYMPIC VICTOR I SAID IS DEEMED HAPPY IN RECEIVING A PART ONLY OF
THE BLESSEDNESS WHICH IS SECURED TO OUR CITIZENS WHO HAVE WON A MORE
GLORIOUS VICTORY AND HAVE A MORE COMPLETE MAINTENANCE AT THE PUBLIC
COST
FOR THE VICTORY WHICH THEY HAVE WON IS THE SALVATION OF THE WHOLE
STATE AND THE CROWN WITH WHICH THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN ARE CROWNED IS
THE FULNESS OF ALL THAT LIFE NEEDS THEY RECEIVE REWARDS FROM THE
HANDS OF THEIR COUNTRY WHILE LIVING AND AFTER DEATH HAVE AN HONOURABLE
BURIAL
YES HE SAID AND GLORIOUS REWARDS THEY ARE
DO YOU REMEMBER I SAID HOW IN THE COURSE OF THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
SOME ONE WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS ACCUSED US OF MAKING OUR GUARDIANS
UNHAPPY THEY HAD NOTHING AND MIGHT HAVE POSSESSED ALL THINGS TO WHOM
WE REPLIED THAT IF AN OCCASION OFFERED WE MIGHT PERHAPS HEREAFTER
CONSIDER THIS QUESTION BUT THAT AS AT PRESENT ADVISED WE WOULD MAKE
OUR GUARDIANS TRULY GUARDIANS AND THAT WE WERE FASHIONING THE STATE
WITH A VIEW TO THE GREATEST HAPPINESS NOT OF ANY PARTICULAR CLASS BUT
OF THE WHOLE
YES I REMEMBER
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY NOW THAT THE LIFE OF OUR PROTECTORS IS MADE OUT TO
BE FAR BETTER AND NOBLER THAN THAT OF OLYMPIC VICTORS IS THE LIFE OF
SHOEMAKERS OR ANY OTHER ARTISANS OR OF HUSBANDMEN TO BE COMPARED WITH
IT
CERTAINLY NOT
AT THE SAME TIME I OUGHT HERE TO REPEAT WHAT I HAVE SAID ELSEWHERE THAT
IF ANY OF OUR GUARDIANS SHALL TRY TO BE HAPPY IN SUCH A MANNER THAT
HE WILL CEASE TO BE A GUARDIAN AND IS NOT CONTENT WITH THIS SAFE AND
HARMONIOUS LIFE WHICH IN OUR JUDGMENT IS OF ALL LIVES THE BEST BUT
INFATUATED BY SOME YOUTHFUL CONCEIT OF HAPPINESS WHICH GETS UP INTO HIS
HEAD SHALL SEEK TO APPROPRIATE THE WHOLE STATE TO HIMSELF THEN HE WILL
HAVE TO LEARN HOW WISELY HESIOD SPOKE WHEN HE SAID 'HALF IS MORE THAN
THE WHOLE
IF HE WERE TO CONSULT ME I SHOULD SAY TO HIM STAY WHERE YOU ARE WHEN
YOU HAVE THE OFFER OF SUCH A LIFE
YOU AGREE THEN I SAID THAT MEN AND WOMEN ARE TO HAVE A COMMON WAY OF
LIFE SUCH AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED COMMON EDUCATION COMMON CHILDREN AND
THEY ARE TO WATCH OVER THE CITIZENS IN COMMON WHETHER ABIDING IN THE
CITY OR GOING OUT TO WAR THEY ARE TO KEEP WATCH TOGETHER AND TO HUNT
TOGETHER LIKE DOGS AND ALWAYS AND IN ALL THINGS AS FAR AS THEY ARE
ABLE WOMEN ARE TO SHARE WITH THE MEN AND IN SO DOING THEY WILL DO WHAT
IS BEST AND WILL NOT VIOLATE BUT PRESERVE THE NATURAL RELATION OF THE
SEXES
I AGREE WITH YOU HE REPLIED
THE ENQUIRY I SAID HAS YET TO BE MADE WHETHER SUCH A COMMUNITY
BE FOUND POSSIBLE AS AMONG OTHER ANIMALS SO ALSO AMONG MEN AND IF
POSSIBLE IN WHAT WAY POSSIBLE
YOU HAVE ANTICIPATED THE QUESTION WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO SUGGEST
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY I SAID IN SEEING HOW WAR WILL BE CARRIED ON BY
THEM
HOW
WHY OF COURSE THEY WILL GO ON EXPEDITIONS TOGETHER AND WILL TAKE WITH
THEM ANY OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO ARE STRONG ENOUGH THAT AFTER THE MANNER
OF THE ARTISAN'S CHILD THEY MAY LOOK ON AT THE WORK WHICH THEY WILL
HAVE TO DO WHEN THEY ARE GROWN UP AND BESIDES LOOKING ON THEY WILL
HAVE TO HELP AND BE OF USE IN WAR AND TO WAIT UPON THEIR FATHERS AND
MOTHERS
DID YOU NEVER OBSERVE IN THE ARTS HOW THE POTTERS' BOYS LOOK ON
AND HELP LONG BEFORE THEY TOUCH THE WHEEL
YES I HAVE
AND SHALL POTTERS BE MORE CAREFUL IN EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN AND IN
GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING AND PRACTISING THEIR DUTIES THAN
OUR GUARDIANS WILL BE
THE IDEA IS RIDICULOUS HE SAID
THERE IS ALSO THE EFFECT ON THE PARENTS WITH WHOM AS WITH OTHER
ANIMALS THE PRESENCE OF THEIR YOUNG ONES WILL BE THE GREATEST INCENTIVE
TO VALOUR
THAT IS QUITE TRUE SOCRATES AND YET IF THEY ARE DEFEATED WHICH MAY
OFTEN HAPPEN IN WAR HOW GREAT THE DANGER IS THE CHILDREN WILL BE LOST
AS WELL AS THEIR PARENTS AND THE STATE WILL NEVER RECOVER
TRUE I SAID BUT WOULD YOU NEVER ALLOW THEM TO RUN ANY RISK
I AM FAR FROM SAYING THAT
WELL BUT IF THEY ARE EVER TO RUN A RISK SHOULD THEY NOT DO SO ON SOME
OCCASION WHEN IF THEY ESCAPE DISASTER THEY WILL BE THE BETTER FOR IT
CLEARLY
WHETHER THE FUTURE SOLDIERS DO OR DO NOT SEE WAR IN THE DAYS OF THEIR
YOUTH IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH SOME RISK MAY
FAIRLY BE INCURRED
YES VERY IMPORTANT
THIS THEN MUST BE OUR FIRST STEP TO MAKE OUR CHILDREN SPECTATORS
OF WAR BUT WE MUST ALSO CONTRIVE THAT THEY SHALL BE SECURED AGAINST
DANGER THEN ALL WILL BE WELL
TRUE
THEIR PARENTS MAY BE SUPPOSED NOT TO BE BLIND TO THE RISKS OF WAR BUT
TO KNOW AS FAR AS HUMAN FORESIGHT CAN WHAT EXPEDITIONS ARE SAFE AND
WHAT DANGEROUS
THAT MAY BE ASSUMED
AND THEY WILL TAKE THEM ON THE SAFE EXPEDITIONS AND BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT
THE DANGEROUS ONES
TRUE
AND THEY WILL PLACE THEM UNDER THE COMMAND OF EXPERIENCED VETERANS WHO
WILL BE THEIR LEADERS AND TEACHERS
VERY PROPERLY
STILL THE DANGERS OF WAR CANNOT BE ALWAYS FORESEEN THERE IS A GOOD
DEAL OF CHANCE ABOUT THEM
TRUE
THEN AGAINST SUCH CHANCES THE CHILDREN MUST BE AT ONCE FURNISHED WITH
WINGS IN ORDER THAT IN THE HOUR OF NEED THEY MAY FLY AWAY AND ESCAPE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
I MEAN THAT WE MUST MOUNT THEM ON HORSES IN THEIR EARLIEST YOUTH AND
WHEN THEY HAVE LEARNT TO RIDE TAKE THEM ON HORSEBACK TO SEE WAR THE
HORSES MUST NOT BE SPIRITED AND WARLIKE BUT THE MOST TRACTABLE AND YET
THE SWIFTEST THAT CAN BE HAD
IN THIS WAY THEY WILL GET AN EXCELLENT
VIEW OF WHAT IS HEREAFTER TO BE THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND IF THERE IS
DANGER THEY HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THEIR ELDER LEADERS AND ESCAPE
I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID
NEXT AS TO WAR WHAT ARE TO BE THE RELATIONS OF YOUR SOLDIERS TO ONE
ANOTHER AND TO THEIR ENEMIES I SHOULD BE INCLINED TO PROPOSE THAT THE
SOLDIER WHO LEAVES HIS RANK OR THROWS AWAY HIS ARMS OR IS GUILTY OF ANY
OTHER ACT OF COWARDICE SHOULD BE DEGRADED INTO THE RANK OF A HUSBANDMAN
OR ARTISAN
WHAT DO YOU THINK
BY ALL MEANS I SHOULD SAY
AND HE WHO ALLOWS HIMSELF TO BE TAKEN PRISONER MAY AS WELL BE MADE A
PRESENT OF TO HIS ENEMIES HE IS THEIR LAWFUL PREY AND LET THEM DO WHAT
THEY LIKE WITH HIM
CERTAINLY
BUT THE HERO WHO HAS DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF WHAT SHALL BE DONE TO
HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE HE SHALL RECEIVE HONOUR IN THE ARMY FROM HIS
YOUTHFUL COMRADES EVERY ONE OF THEM IN SUCCESSION SHALL CROWN HIM
WHAT
DO YOU SAY
I APPROVE
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY TO HIS RECEIVING THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP
TO THAT TOO I AGREE
BUT YOU WILL HARDLY AGREE TO MY NEXT PROPOSAL
WHAT IS YOUR PROPOSAL
THAT HE SHOULD KISS AND BE KISSED BY THEM
MOST CERTAINLY AND I SHOULD BE DISPOSED TO GO FURTHER AND SAY LET
NO ONE WHOM HE HAS A MIND TO KISS REFUSE TO BE KISSED BY HIM WHILE THE
EXPEDITION LASTS
SO THAT IF THERE BE A LOVER IN THE ARMY WHETHER
HIS LOVE BE YOUTH OR MAIDEN HE MAY BE MORE EAGER TO WIN THE PRIZE OF
VALOUR
CAPITAL I SAID
THAT THE BRAVE MAN IS TO HAVE MORE WIVES THAN OTHERS
HAS BEEN ALREADY DETERMINED AND HE IS TO HAVE FIRST CHOICES IN SUCH
MATTERS MORE THAN OTHERS IN ORDER THAT HE MAY HAVE AS MANY CHILDREN AS
POSSIBLE
AGREED
AGAIN THERE IS ANOTHER MANNER IN WHICH ACCORDING TO HOMER BRAVE
YOUTHS SHOULD BE HONOURED FOR HE TELLS HOW AJAX AFTER HE HAD
DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN BATTLE WAS REWARDED WITH LONG CHINES WHICH
SEEMS TO BE A COMPLIMENT APPROPRIATE TO A HERO IN THE FLOWER OF HIS AGE
BEING NOT ONLY A TRIBUTE OF HONOUR BUT ALSO A VERY STRENGTHENING THING
MOST TRUE HE SAID
THEN IN THIS I SAID HOMER SHALL BE OUR TEACHER AND WE TOO AT
SACRIFICES AND ON THE LIKE OCCASIONS WILL HONOUR THE BRAVE ACCORDING TO
THE MEASURE OF THEIR VALOUR WHETHER MEN OR WOMEN WITH HYMNS AND THOSE
OTHER DISTINCTIONS WHICH WE WERE MENTIONING ALSO WITH
'SEATS OF PRECEDENCE AND MEATS AND FULL CUPS
AND IN HONOURING THEM WE SHALL BE AT THE SAME TIME TRAINING THEM
THAT HE REPLIED IS EXCELLENT
YES I SAID AND WHEN A MAN DIES GLORIOUSLY IN WAR SHALL WE NOT SAY IN
THE FIRST PLACE THAT HE IS OF THE GOLDEN RACE
TO BE SURE
NAY HAVE WE NOT THE AUTHORITY OF HESIOD FOR AFFIRMING THAT WHEN THEY
ARE DEAD
'THEY ARE HOLY ANGELS UPON THE EARTH AUTHORS OF GOOD AVERTERS OF EVIL
THE GUARDIANS OF SPEECH GIFTED MEN'
YES AND WE ACCEPT HIS AUTHORITY
WE MUST LEARN OF THE GOD HOW WE ARE TO ORDER THE SEPULTURE OF DIVINE AND
HEROIC PERSONAGES AND WHAT IS TO BE THEIR SPECIAL DISTINCTION AND WE
MUST DO AS HE BIDS
BY ALL MEANS
AND IN AGES TO COME WE WILL REVERENCE THEM AND KNEEL BEFORE THEIR
SEPULCHRES AS AT THE GRAVES OF HEROES
AND NOT ONLY THEY BUT ANY WHO ARE
DEEMED PRE EMINENTLY GOOD WHETHER THEY DIE FROM AGE OR IN ANY OTHER
WAY SHALL BE ADMITTED TO THE SAME HONOURS
THAT IS VERY RIGHT HE SAID
NEXT HOW SHALL OUR SOLDIERS TREAT THEIR ENEMIES WHAT ABOUT THIS
IN WHAT RESPECT DO YOU MEAN
FIRST OF ALL IN REGARD TO SLAVERY DO YOU THINK IT RIGHT THAT HELLENES
SHOULD ENSLAVE HELLENIC STATES OR ALLOW OTHERS TO ENSLAVE THEM IF
THEY CAN HELP SHOULD NOT THEIR CUSTOM BE TO SPARE THEM CONSIDERING
THE DANGER WHICH THERE IS THAT THE WHOLE RACE MAY ONE DAY FALL UNDER THE
YOKE OF THE BARBARIANS
TO SPARE THEM IS INFINITELY BETTER
THEN NO HELLENE SHOULD BE OWNED BY THEM AS A SLAVE THAT IS A RULE WHICH
THEY WILL OBSERVE AND ADVISE THE OTHER HELLENES TO OBSERVE
CERTAINLY HE SAID THEY WILL IN THIS WAY BE UNITED AGAINST THE
BARBARIANS AND WILL KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF ONE ANOTHER
NEXT AS TO THE SLAIN OUGHT THE CONQUERORS I SAID TO TAKE ANYTHING
BUT THEIR ARMOUR DOES NOT THE PRACTICE OF DESPOILING AN ENEMY AFFORD
AN EXCUSE FOR NOT FACING THE BATTLE COWARDS SKULK ABOUT THE DEAD
PRETENDING THAT THEY ARE FULFILLING A DUTY AND MANY AN ARMY BEFORE NOW
HAS BEEN LOST FROM THIS LOVE OF PLUNDER
VERY TRUE
AND IS THERE NOT ILLIBERALITY AND AVARICE IN ROBBING A CORPSE AND ALSO
A DEGREE OF MEANNESS AND WOMANISHNESS IN MAKING AN ENEMY OF THE DEAD
BODY WHEN THE REAL ENEMY HAS FLOWN AWAY AND LEFT ONLY HIS FIGHTING
GEAR BEHIND HIM IS NOT THIS RATHER LIKE A DOG WHO CANNOT GET AT HIS
ASSAILANT QUARRELLING WITH THE STONES WHICH STRIKE HIM INSTEAD
VERY LIKE A DOG HE SAID
THEN WE MUST ABSTAIN FROM SPOILING THE DEAD OR HINDERING THEIR BURIAL
YES HE REPLIED WE MOST CERTAINLY MUST
NEITHER SHALL WE OFFER UP ARMS AT THE TEMPLES OF THE GODS LEAST OF ALL
THE ARMS OF HELLENES IF WE CARE TO MAINTAIN GOOD FEELING WITH OTHER
HELLENES AND INDEED WE HAVE REASON TO FEAR THAT THE OFFERING OF
SPOILS TAKEN FROM KINSMEN MAY BE A POLLUTION UNLESS COMMANDED BY THE GOD
HIMSELF
VERY TRUE
AGAIN AS TO THE DEVASTATION OF HELLENIC TERRITORY OR THE BURNING OF
HOUSES WHAT IS TO BE THE PRACTICE
MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE HE SAID OF HEARING YOUR OPINION
BOTH SHOULD BE FORBIDDEN IN MY JUDGMENT I WOULD TAKE THE ANNUAL
PRODUCE AND NO MORE
SHALL I TELL YOU WHY
PRAY DO
WHY YOU SEE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE NAMES 'DISCORD' AND 'WAR
AND I IMAGINE THAT THERE IS ALSO A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR NATURES THE ONE
IS EXPRESSIVE OF WHAT IS INTERNAL AND DOMESTIC THE OTHER OF WHAT IS
EXTERNAL AND FOREIGN AND THE FIRST OF THE TWO IS TERMED DISCORD AND
ONLY THE SECOND WAR
THAT IS A VERY PROPER DISTINCTION HE REPLIED
AND MAY I NOT OBSERVE WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY THAT THE HELLENIC RACE IS ALL
UNITED TOGETHER BY TIES OF BLOOD AND FRIENDSHIP AND ALIEN AND STRANGE
TO THE BARBARIANS
VERY GOOD HE SAID
AND THEREFORE WHEN HELLENES FIGHT WITH BARBARIANS AND BARBARIANS WITH
HELLENES THEY WILL BE DESCRIBED BY US AS BEING AT WAR WHEN THEY FIGHT
AND BY NATURE ENEMIES AND THIS KIND OF ANTAGONISM SHOULD BE CALLED WAR
BUT WHEN HELLENES FIGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER WE SHALL SAY THAT HELLAS IS
THEN IN A STATE OF DISORDER AND DISCORD THEY BEING BY NATURE FRIENDS
AND SUCH ENMITY IS TO BE CALLED DISCORD
I AGREE
CONSIDER THEN I SAID WHEN THAT WHICH WE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE
DISCORD OCCURS AND A CITY IS DIVIDED IF BOTH PARTIES DESTROY THE LANDS
AND BURN THE HOUSES OF ONE ANOTHER HOW WICKED DOES THE STRIFE APPEAR
NO TRUE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY WOULD BRING HIMSELF TO TEAR IN PIECES HIS
OWN NURSE AND MOTHER THERE MIGHT BE REASON IN THE CONQUEROR DEPRIVING
THE CONQUERED OF THEIR HARVEST BUT STILL THEY WOULD HAVE THE IDEA OF
PEACE IN THEIR HEARTS AND WOULD NOT MEAN TO GO ON FIGHTING FOR EVER
YES HE SAID THAT IS A BETTER TEMPER THAN THE OTHER
AND WILL NOT THE CITY WHICH YOU ARE FOUNDING BE AN HELLENIC CITY
IT OUGHT TO BE HE REPLIED
THEN WILL NOT THE CITIZENS BE GOOD AND CIVILIZED
YES VERY CIVILIZED
AND WILL THEY NOT BE LOVERS OF HELLAS AND THINK OF HELLAS AS THEIR OWN
LAND AND SHARE IN THE COMMON TEMPLES
MOST CERTAINLY
AND ANY DIFFERENCE WHICH ARISES AMONG THEM WILL BE REGARDED BY THEM AS
DISCORD ONLY A QUARREL AMONG FRIENDS WHICH IS NOT TO BE CALLED A WAR
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN THEY WILL QUARREL AS THOSE WHO INTEND SOME DAY TO BE RECONCILED
CERTAINLY
THEY WILL USE FRIENDLY CORRECTION BUT WILL NOT ENSLAVE OR DESTROY THEIR
OPPONENTS THEY WILL BE CORRECTORS NOT ENEMIES
JUST SO
AND AS THEY ARE HELLENES THEMSELVES THEY WILL NOT DEVASTATE HELLAS NOR
WILL THEY BURN HOUSES NOR EVER SUPPOSE THAT THE WHOLE POPULATION OF A
CITY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE EQUALLY THEIR ENEMIES FOR THEY KNOW
THAT THE GUILT OF WAR IS ALWAYS CONFINED TO A FEW PERSONS AND THAT THE
MANY ARE THEIR FRIENDS
AND FOR ALL THESE REASONS THEY WILL BE UNWILLING
TO WASTE THEIR LANDS AND RASE THEIR HOUSES THEIR ENMITY TO THEM WILL
ONLY LAST UNTIL THE MANY INNOCENT SUFFERERS HAVE COMPELLED THE GUILTY
FEW TO GIVE SATISFACTION
I AGREE HE SAID THAT OUR CITIZENS SHOULD THUS DEAL WITH THEIR HELLENIC
ENEMIES AND WITH BARBARIANS AS THE HELLENES NOW DEAL WITH ONE ANOTHER
THEN LET US ENACT THIS LAW ALSO FOR OUR GUARDIANS THAT THEY ARE
NEITHER TO DEVASTATE THE LANDS OF HELLENES NOR TO BURN THEIR HOUSES
AGREED AND WE MAY AGREE ALSO IN THINKING THAT THESE LIKE ALL OUR
PREVIOUS ENACTMENTS ARE VERY GOOD
BUT STILL I MUST SAY SOCRATES THAT IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO GO ON IN
THIS WAY YOU WILL ENTIRELY FORGET THE OTHER QUESTION WHICH AT THE
COMMENCEMENT OF THIS DISCUSSION YOU THRUST ASIDE IS SUCH AN ORDER OF
THINGS POSSIBLE AND HOW IF AT ALL FOR I AM QUITE READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THE PLAN WHICH YOU PROPOSE IF ONLY FEASIBLE WOULD DO ALL SORTS OF
GOOD TO THE STATE
I WILL ADD WHAT YOU HAVE OMITTED THAT YOUR CITIZENS
WILL BE THE BRAVEST OF WARRIORS AND WILL NEVER LEAVE THEIR RANKS FOR
THEY WILL ALL KNOW ONE ANOTHER AND EACH WILL CALL THE OTHER FATHER
BROTHER SON AND IF YOU SUPPOSE THE WOMEN TO JOIN THEIR ARMIES WHETHER
IN THE SAME RANK OR IN THE REAR EITHER AS A TERROR TO THE ENEMY OR AS
AUXILIARIES IN CASE OF NEED I KNOW THAT THEY WILL THEN BE ABSOLUTELY
INVINCIBLE AND THERE ARE MANY DOMESTIC ADVANTAGES WHICH MIGHT ALSO BE
MENTIONED AND WHICH I ALSO FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE BUT AS I ADMIT ALL THESE
ADVANTAGES AND AS MANY MORE AS YOU PLEASE IF ONLY THIS STATE OF YOURS
WERE TO COME INTO EXISTENCE WE NEED SAY NO MORE ABOUT THEM ASSUMING
THEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE LET US NOW TURN TO THE QUESTION OF
POSSIBILITY AND WAYS AND MEANS THE REST MAY BE LEFT
IF I LOITER FOR A MOMENT YOU INSTANTLY MAKE A RAID UPON ME I SAID AND
HAVE NO MERCY I HAVE HARDLY ESCAPED THE FIRST AND SECOND WAVES AND YOU
SEEM NOT TO BE AWARE THAT YOU ARE NOW BRINGING UPON ME THE THIRD WHICH
IS THE GREATEST AND HEAVIEST
WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN AND HEARD THE THIRD
WAVE I THINK YOU WILL BE MORE CONSIDERATE AND WILL ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT SOME FEAR AND HESITATION WAS NATURAL RESPECTING A PROPOSAL SO
EXTRAORDINARY AS THAT WHICH I HAVE NOW TO STATE AND INVESTIGATE
THE MORE APPEALS OF THIS SORT WHICH YOU MAKE HE SAID THE MORE
DETERMINED ARE WE THAT YOU SHALL TELL US HOW SUCH A STATE IS POSSIBLE
SPEAK OUT AND AT ONCE
LET ME BEGIN BY REMINDING YOU THAT WE FOUND OUR WAY HITHER IN THE SEARCH
AFTER JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE
TRUE HE REPLIED BUT WHAT OF THAT
I WAS ONLY GOING TO ASK WHETHER IF WE HAVE DISCOVERED THEM WE ARE TO
REQUIRE THAT THE JUST MAN SHOULD IN NOTHING FAIL OF ABSOLUTE JUSTICE OR
MAY WE BE SATISFIED WITH AN APPROXIMATION AND THE ATTAINMENT IN HIM OF
A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUSTICE THAN IS TO BE FOUND IN OTHER MEN
THE APPROXIMATION WILL BE ENOUGH
WE WERE ENQUIRING INTO THE NATURE OF ABSOLUTE JUSTICE AND INTO THE
CHARACTER OF THE PERFECTLY JUST AND INTO INJUSTICE AND THE PERFECTLY
UNJUST THAT WE MIGHT HAVE AN IDEAL
WE WERE TO LOOK AT THESE IN ORDER
THAT WE MIGHT JUDGE OF OUR OWN HAPPINESS AND UNHAPPINESS ACCORDING TO
THE STANDARD WHICH THEY EXHIBITED AND THE DEGREE IN WHICH WE RESEMBLED
THEM BUT NOT WITH ANY VIEW OF SHOWING THAT THEY COULD EXIST IN FACT
TRUE HE SAID
WOULD A PAINTER BE ANY THE WORSE BECAUSE AFTER HAVING DELINEATED WITH
CONSUMMATE ART AN IDEAL OF A PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL MAN HE WAS UNABLE TO
SHOW THAT ANY SUCH MAN COULD EVER HAVE EXISTED
HE WOULD BE NONE THE WORSE
WELL AND WERE WE NOT CREATING AN IDEAL OF A PERFECT STATE
TO BE SURE
AND IS OUR THEORY A WORSE THEORY BECAUSE WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVE THE
POSSIBILITY OF A CITY BEING ORDERED IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED
SURELY NOT HE REPLIED
THAT IS THE TRUTH I SAID
BUT IF AT YOUR REQUEST I AM TO TRY AND SHOW
HOW AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THE POSSIBILITY IS HIGHEST I MUST ASK
YOU HAVING THIS IN VIEW TO REPEAT YOUR FORMER ADMISSIONS
WHAT ADMISSIONS
I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER IDEALS ARE EVER FULLY REALIZED IN LANGUAGE
DOES NOT THE WORD EXPRESS MORE THAN THE FACT AND MUST NOT THE ACTUAL
WHATEVER A MAN MAY THINK ALWAYS IN THE NATURE OF THINGS FALL SHORT OF
THE TRUTH WHAT DO YOU SAY
I AGREE
THEN YOU MUST NOT INSIST ON MY PROVING THAT THE ACTUAL STATE WILL IN
EVERY RESPECT COINCIDE WITH THE IDEAL IF WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO DISCOVER
HOW A CITY MAY BE GOVERNED NEARLY AS WE PROPOSED YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WE
HAVE DISCOVERED THE POSSIBILITY WHICH YOU DEMAND AND WILL BE CONTENTED
I AM SURE THAT I SHOULD BE CONTENTED WILL NOT YOU
YES I WILL
LET ME NEXT ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW WHAT IS THAT FAULT IN STATES WHICH IS THE
CAUSE OF THEIR PRESENT MALADMINISTRATION AND WHAT IS THE LEAST CHANGE
WHICH WILL ENABLE A STATE TO PASS INTO THE TRUER FORM AND LET THE
CHANGE IF POSSIBLE BE OF ONE THING ONLY OR IF NOT OF TWO AT ANY
RATE LET THE CHANGES BE AS FEW AND SLIGHT AS POSSIBLE
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
I THINK I SAID THAT THERE MIGHT BE A REFORM OF THE STATE IF ONLY ONE
CHANGE WERE MADE WHICH IS NOT A SLIGHT OR EASY THOUGH STILL A POSSIBLE
ONE
WHAT IS IT HE SAID
NOW THEN I SAID I GO TO MEET THAT WHICH I LIKEN TO THE GREATEST OF
THE WAVES YET SHALL THE WORD BE SPOKEN EVEN THOUGH THE WAVE BREAK AND
DROWN ME IN LAUGHTER AND DISHONOUR AND DO YOU MARK MY WORDS
PROCEED
I SAID 'UNTIL PHILOSOPHERS ARE KINGS OR THE KINGS AND PRINCES OF THIS
WORLD HAVE THE SPIRIT AND POWER OF PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICAL GREATNESS
AND WISDOM MEET IN ONE AND THOSE COMMONER NATURES WHO PURSUE EITHER
TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE OTHER ARE COMPELLED TO STAND ASIDE CITIES
WILL NEVER HAVE REST FROM THEIR EVILS NOR THE HUMAN RACE AS I
BELIEVE AND THEN ONLY WILL THIS OUR STATE HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF LIFE
AND BEHOLD THE LIGHT OF DAY SUCH WAS THE THOUGHT MY DEAR GLAUCON
WHICH I WOULD FAIN HAVE UTTERED IF IT HAD NOT SEEMED TOO EXTRAVAGANT
FOR TO BE CONVINCED THAT IN NO OTHER STATE CAN THERE BE HAPPINESS
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC IS INDEED A HARD THING
SOCRATES WHAT DO YOU MEAN I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER THAT THE WORD
WHICH YOU HAVE UTTERED IS ONE AT WHICH NUMEROUS PERSONS AND VERY
RESPECTABLE PERSONS TOO IN A FIGURE PULLING OFF THEIR COATS ALL IN A
MOMENT AND SEIZING ANY WEAPON THAT COMES TO HAND WILL RUN AT YOU MIGHT
AND MAIN BEFORE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE INTENDING TO DO HEAVEN KNOWS
WHAT AND IF YOU DON'T PREPARE AN ANSWER AND PUT YOURSELF IN MOTION
YOU WILL BE 'PARED BY THEIR FINE WITS AND NO MISTAKE
YOU GOT ME INTO THE SCRAPE I SAID
AND I WAS QUITE RIGHT HOWEVER I WILL DO ALL I CAN TO GET YOU OUT OF
IT BUT I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU GOOD WILL AND GOOD ADVICE AND PERHAPS I
MAY BE ABLE TO FIT ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS BETTER THAN ANOTHER THAT
IS ALL
AND NOW HAVING SUCH AN AUXILIARY YOU MUST DO YOUR BEST TO SHOW
THE UNBELIEVERS THAT YOU ARE RIGHT
I OUGHT TO TRY I SAID SINCE YOU OFFER ME SUCH INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE
AND I THINK THAT IF THERE IS TO BE A CHANCE OF OUR ESCAPING WE MUST
EXPLAIN TO THEM WHOM WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY THAT PHILOSOPHERS ARE TO RULE
IN THE STATE THEN WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DEFEND OURSELVES THERE WILL BE
DISCOVERED TO BE SOME NATURES WHO OUGHT TO STUDY PHILOSOPHY AND TO BE
LEADERS IN THE STATE AND OTHERS WHO ARE NOT BORN TO BE PHILOSOPHERS
AND ARE MEANT TO BE FOLLOWERS RATHER THAN LEADERS
THEN NOW FOR A DEFINITION HE SAID
FOLLOW ME I SAID AND I HOPE THAT I MAY IN SOME WAY OR OTHER BE ABLE TO
GIVE YOU A SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION
PROCEED
I DARE SAY THAT YOU REMEMBER AND THEREFORE I NEED NOT REMIND YOU THAT
A LOVER IF HE IS WORTHY OF THE NAME OUGHT TO SHOW HIS LOVE NOT TO
SOME ONE PART OF THAT WHICH HE LOVES BUT TO THE WHOLE
I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEREFORE BEG OF YOU TO ASSIST MY
MEMORY
ANOTHER PERSON I SAID MIGHT FAIRLY REPLY AS YOU DO BUT A MAN OF
PLEASURE LIKE YOURSELF OUGHT TO KNOW THAT ALL WHO ARE IN THE FLOWER OF
YOUTH DO SOMEHOW OR OTHER RAISE A PANG OR EMOTION IN A LOVER'S BREAST
AND ARE THOUGHT BY HIM TO BE WORTHY OF HIS AFFECTIONATE REGARDS
IS NOT
THIS A WAY WHICH YOU HAVE WITH THE FAIR ONE HAS A SNUB NOSE AND YOU
PRAISE HIS CHARMING FACE THE HOOK NOSE OF ANOTHER HAS YOU SAY A
ROYAL LOOK WHILE HE WHO IS NEITHER SNUB NOR HOOKED HAS THE GRACE OF
REGULARITY THE DARK VISAGE IS MANLY THE FAIR ARE CHILDREN OF THE GODS
AND AS TO THE SWEET 'HONEY PALE AS THEY ARE CALLED WHAT IS THE VERY
NAME BUT THE INVENTION OF A LOVER WHO TALKS IN DIMINUTIVES AND IS NOT
AVERSE TO PALENESS IF APPEARING ON THE CHEEK OF YOUTH IN A WORD THERE
IS NO EXCUSE WHICH YOU WILL NOT MAKE AND NOTHING WHICH YOU WILL NOT
SAY IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE A SINGLE FLOWER THAT BLOOMS IN THE SPRING TIME
OF YOUTH
IF YOU MAKE ME AN AUTHORITY IN MATTERS OF LOVE FOR THE SAKE OF THE
ARGUMENT I ASSENT
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OF LOVERS OF WINE DO YOU NOT SEE THEM DOING THE
SAME THEY ARE GLAD OF ANY PRETEXT OF DRINKING ANY WINE
VERY GOOD
AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF AMBITIOUS MEN IF THEY CANNOT COMMAND AN ARMY
THEY ARE WILLING TO COMMAND A FILE AND IF THEY CANNOT BE HONOURED BY
REALLY GREAT AND IMPORTANT PERSONS THEY ARE GLAD TO BE HONOURED BY
LESSER AND MEANER PEOPLE BUT HONOUR OF SOME KIND THEY MUST HAVE
EXACTLY
ONCE MORE LET ME ASK DOES HE WHO DESIRES ANY CLASS OF GOODS DESIRE THE
WHOLE CLASS OR A PART ONLY
THE WHOLE
AND MAY WE NOT SAY OF THE PHILOSOPHER THAT HE IS A LOVER NOT OF A PART
OF WISDOM ONLY BUT OF THE WHOLE
YES OF THE WHOLE
AND HE WHO DISLIKES LEARNING ESPECIALLY IN YOUTH WHEN HE HAS NO POWER
OF JUDGING WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT IS NOT SUCH AN ONE WE MAINTAIN NOT
TO BE A PHILOSOPHER OR A LOVER OF KNOWLEDGE JUST AS HE WHO REFUSES HIS
FOOD IS NOT HUNGRY AND MAY BE SAID TO HAVE A BAD APPETITE AND NOT A
GOOD ONE
VERY TRUE HE SAID
WHEREAS HE WHO HAS A TASTE FOR EVERY SORT OF KNOWLEDGE AND WHO IS
CURIOUS TO LEARN AND IS NEVER SATISFIED MAY BE JUSTLY TERMED A
PHILOSOPHER AM I NOT RIGHT
GLAUCON SAID IF CURIOSITY MAKES A PHILOSOPHER YOU WILL FIND MANY A
STRANGE BEING WILL HAVE A TITLE TO THE NAME
ALL THE LOVERS OF SIGHTS
HAVE A DELIGHT IN LEARNING AND MUST THEREFORE BE INCLUDED
MUSICAL
AMATEURS TOO ARE A FOLK STRANGELY OUT OF PLACE AMONG PHILOSOPHERS FOR
THEY ARE THE LAST PERSONS IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD COME TO ANYTHING LIKE
A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION IF THEY COULD HELP WHILE THEY RUN ABOUT AT
THE DIONYSIAC FESTIVALS AS IF THEY HAD LET OUT THEIR EARS TO HEAR EVERY
CHORUS WHETHER THE PERFORMANCE IS IN TOWN OR COUNTRY THAT MAKES NO
DIFFERENCE THEY ARE THERE
NOW ARE WE TO MAINTAIN THAT ALL THESE AND
ANY WHO HAVE SIMILAR TASTES AS WELL AS THE PROFESSORS OF QUITE MINOR
ARTS ARE PHILOSOPHERS
CERTAINLY NOT I REPLIED THEY ARE ONLY AN IMITATION
HE SAID WHO THEN ARE THE TRUE PHILOSOPHERS
THOSE I SAID WHO ARE LOVERS OF THE VISION OF TRUTH
THAT IS ALSO GOOD HE SAID BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
TO ANOTHER I REPLIED I MIGHT HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING BUT I AM
SURE THAT YOU WILL ADMIT A PROPOSITION WHICH I AM ABOUT TO MAKE
WHAT IS THE PROPOSITION
THAT SINCE BEAUTY IS THE OPPOSITE OF UGLINESS THEY ARE TWO
CERTAINLY
AND INASMUCH AS THEY ARE TWO EACH OF THEM IS ONE
TRUE AGAIN
AND OF JUST AND UNJUST GOOD AND EVIL AND OF EVERY OTHER CLASS THE
SAME REMARK HOLDS TAKEN SINGLY EACH OF THEM IS ONE BUT FROM THE
VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF THEM WITH ACTIONS AND THINGS AND WITH ONE
ANOTHER THEY ARE SEEN IN ALL SORTS OF LIGHTS AND APPEAR MANY
VERY TRUE
AND THIS IS THE DISTINCTION WHICH I DRAW BETWEEN THE SIGHT LOVING
ART LOVING PRACTICAL CLASS AND THOSE OF WHOM I AM SPEAKING AND WHO ARE
ALONE WORTHY OF THE NAME OF PHILOSOPHERS
HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH THEM HE SAID
THE LOVERS OF SOUNDS AND SIGHTS I REPLIED ARE AS I CONCEIVE FOND OF
FINE TONES AND COLOURS AND FORMS AND ALL THE ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTS THAT
ARE MADE OUT OF THEM BUT THEIR MIND IS INCAPABLE OF SEEING OR LOVING
ABSOLUTE BEAUTY
TRUE HE REPLIED
FEW ARE THEY WHO ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN TO THE SIGHT OF THIS
VERY TRUE
AND HE WHO HAVING A SENSE OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS HAS NO SENSE OF ABSOLUTE
BEAUTY OR WHO IF ANOTHER LEAD HIM TO A KNOWLEDGE OF THAT BEAUTY IS
UNABLE TO FOLLOW OF SUCH AN ONE I ASK IS HE AWAKE OR IN A DREAM
ONLY REFLECT IS NOT THE DREAMER SLEEPING OR WAKING ONE WHO LIKENS
DISSIMILAR THINGS WHO PUTS THE COPY IN THE PLACE OF THE REAL OBJECT
I SHOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT SUCH AN ONE WAS DREAMING
BUT TAKE THE CASE OF THE OTHER WHO RECOGNISES THE EXISTENCE OF ABSOLUTE
BEAUTY AND IS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE IDEA FROM THE OBJECTS WHICH
PARTICIPATE IN THE IDEA NEITHER PUTTING THE OBJECTS IN THE PLACE OF THE
IDEA NOR THE IDEA IN THE PLACE OF THE OBJECTS IS HE A DREAMER OR IS HE
AWAKE
HE IS WIDE AWAKE
AND MAY WE NOT SAY THAT THE MIND OF THE ONE WHO KNOWS HAS KNOWLEDGE AND
THAT THE MIND OF THE OTHER WHO OPINES ONLY HAS OPINION
CERTAINLY
BUT SUPPOSE THAT THE LATTER SHOULD QUARREL WITH US AND DISPUTE OUR
STATEMENT CAN WE ADMINISTER ANY SOOTHING CORDIAL OR ADVICE TO HIM
WITHOUT REVEALING TO HIM THAT THERE IS SAD DISORDER IN HIS WITS
WE MUST CERTAINLY OFFER HIM SOME GOOD ADVICE HE REPLIED
COME THEN AND LET US THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO HIM
SHALL WE BEGIN
BY ASSURING HIM THAT HE IS WELCOME TO ANY KNOWLEDGE WHICH HE MAY HAVE
AND THAT WE ARE REJOICED AT HIS HAVING IT BUT WE SHOULD LIKE TO ASK HIM
A QUESTION DOES HE WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE KNOW SOMETHING OR NOTHING YOU
MUST ANSWER FOR HIM
I ANSWER THAT HE KNOWS SOMETHING
SOMETHING THAT IS OR IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT IS FOR HOW CAN THAT WHICH IS NOT EVER BE KNOWN
AND ARE WE ASSURED AFTER LOOKING AT THE MATTER FROM MANY POINTS OF
VIEW THAT ABSOLUTE BEING IS OR MAY BE ABSOLUTELY KNOWN BUT THAT THE
UTTERLY NON EXISTENT IS UTTERLY UNKNOWN
NOTHING CAN BE MORE CERTAIN
GOOD
BUT IF THERE BE ANYTHING WHICH IS OF SUCH A NATURE AS TO BE AND
NOT TO BE THAT WILL HAVE A PLACE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN PURE BEING AND
THE ABSOLUTE NEGATION OF BEING
YES BETWEEN THEM
AND AS KNOWLEDGE CORRESPONDED TO BEING AND IGNORANCE OF NECESSITY TO
NOT BEING FOR THAT INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN BEING AND NOT BEING THERE HAS
TO BE DISCOVERED A CORRESPONDING INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN IGNORANCE AND
KNOWLEDGE IF THERE BE SUCH
CERTAINLY
DO WE ADMIT THE EXISTENCE OF OPINION
UNDOUBTEDLY
AS BEING THE SAME WITH KNOWLEDGE OR ANOTHER FACULTY
ANOTHER FACULTY
THEN OPINION AND KNOWLEDGE HAVE TO DO WITH DIFFERENT KINDS OF MATTER
CORRESPONDING TO THIS DIFFERENCE OF FACULTIES
YES
AND KNOWLEDGE IS RELATIVE TO BEING AND KNOWS BEING
BUT BEFORE I PROCEED
FURTHER I WILL MAKE A DIVISION
WHAT DIVISION
I WILL BEGIN BY PLACING FACULTIES IN A CLASS BY THEMSELVES THEY ARE
POWERS IN US AND IN ALL OTHER THINGS BY WHICH WE DO AS WE DO
SIGHT
AND HEARING FOR EXAMPLE I SHOULD CALL FACULTIES
HAVE I CLEARLY
EXPLAINED THE CLASS WHICH I MEAN
YES I QUITE UNDERSTAND
THEN LET ME TELL YOU MY VIEW ABOUT THEM
I DO NOT SEE THEM AND
THEREFORE THE DISTINCTIONS OF FIGURE COLOUR AND THE LIKE WHICH ENABLE
ME TO DISCERN THE DIFFERENCES OF SOME THINGS DO NOT APPLY TO THEM
IN
SPEAKING OF A FACULTY I THINK ONLY OF ITS SPHERE AND ITS RESULT AND
THAT WHICH HAS THE SAME SPHERE AND THE SAME RESULT I CALL THE SAME
FACULTY BUT THAT WHICH HAS ANOTHER SPHERE AND ANOTHER RESULT I CALL
DIFFERENT
WOULD THAT BE YOUR WAY OF SPEAKING
YES
AND WILL YOU BE SO VERY GOOD AS TO ANSWER ONE MORE QUESTION WOULD YOU
SAY THAT KNOWLEDGE IS A FACULTY OR IN WHAT CLASS WOULD YOU PLACE IT
CERTAINLY KNOWLEDGE IS A FACULTY AND THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL FACULTIES
AND IS OPINION ALSO A FACULTY
CERTAINLY HE SAID FOR OPINION IS THAT WITH WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO FORM
AN OPINION
AND YET YOU WERE ACKNOWLEDGING A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT
THE SAME AS OPINION
WHY YES HE SAID HOW CAN ANY REASONABLE BEING EVER IDENTIFY THAT WHICH
IS INFALLIBLE WITH THAT WHICH ERRS
AN EXCELLENT ANSWER PROVING I SAID THAT WE ARE QUITE CONSCIOUS OF A
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM
YES
THEN KNOWLEDGE AND OPINION HAVING DISTINCT POWERS HAVE ALSO DISTINCT
SPHERES OR SUBJECT MATTERS
THAT IS CERTAIN
BEING IS THE SPHERE OR SUBJECT MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE IS TO
KNOW THE NATURE OF BEING
YES
AND OPINION IS TO HAVE AN OPINION
YES
AND DO WE KNOW WHAT WE OPINE OR IS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF OPINION THE
SAME AS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE
NAY HE REPLIED THAT HAS BEEN ALREADY DISPROVEN IF DIFFERENCE IN
FACULTY IMPLIES DIFFERENCE IN THE SPHERE OR SUBJECT MATTER AND IF AS
WE WERE SAYING OPINION AND KNOWLEDGE ARE DISTINCT FACULTIES THEN THE
SPHERE OF KNOWLEDGE AND OF OPINION CANNOT BE THE SAME
THEN IF BEING IS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF KNOWLEDGE SOMETHING ELSE MUST BE
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF OPINION
YES SOMETHING ELSE
WELL THEN IS NOT BEING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF OPINION OR RATHER HOW
CAN THERE BE AN OPINION AT ALL ABOUT NOT BEING REFLECT WHEN A MAN
HAS AN OPINION HAS HE NOT AN OPINION ABOUT SOMETHING CAN HE HAVE AN
OPINION WHICH IS AN OPINION ABOUT NOTHING
IMPOSSIBLE
HE WHO HAS AN OPINION HAS AN OPINION ABOUT SOME ONE THING
YES
AND NOT BEING IS NOT ONE THING BUT PROPERLY SPEAKING NOTHING
TRUE
OF NOT BEING IGNORANCE WAS ASSUMED TO BE THE NECESSARY CORRELATIVE OF
BEING KNOWLEDGE
TRUE HE SAID
THEN OPINION IS NOT CONCERNED EITHER WITH BEING OR WITH NOT BEING
NOT WITH EITHER
AND CAN THEREFORE NEITHER BE IGNORANCE NOR KNOWLEDGE
THAT SEEMS TO BE TRUE
BUT IS OPINION TO BE SOUGHT WITHOUT AND BEYOND EITHER OF THEM IN
A GREATER CLEARNESS THAN KNOWLEDGE OR IN A GREATER DARKNESS THAN
IGNORANCE
IN NEITHER
THEN I SUPPOSE THAT OPINION APPEARS TO YOU TO BE DARKER THAN KNOWLEDGE
BUT LIGHTER THAN IGNORANCE
BOTH AND IN NO SMALL DEGREE
AND ALSO TO BE WITHIN AND BETWEEN THEM
YES
THEN YOU WOULD INFER THAT OPINION IS INTERMEDIATE
NO QUESTION
BUT WERE WE NOT SAYING BEFORE THAT IF ANYTHING APPEARED TO BE OF A SORT
WHICH IS AND IS NOT AT THE SAME TIME THAT SORT OF THING WOULD APPEAR
ALSO TO LIE IN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN PURE BEING AND ABSOLUTE NOT BEING
AND THAT THE CORRESPONDING FACULTY IS NEITHER KNOWLEDGE NOR IGNORANCE
BUT WILL BE FOUND IN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THEM
TRUE
AND IN THAT INTERVAL THERE HAS NOW BEEN DISCOVERED SOMETHING WHICH WE
CALL OPINION
THERE HAS
THEN WHAT REMAINS TO BE DISCOVERED IS THE OBJECT WHICH PARTAKES EQUALLY
OF THE NATURE OF BEING AND NOT BEING AND CANNOT RIGHTLY BE TERMED
EITHER PURE AND SIMPLE THIS UNKNOWN TERM WHEN DISCOVERED WE MAY
TRULY CALL THE SUBJECT OF OPINION AND ASSIGN EACH TO THEIR PROPER
FACULTY THE EXTREMES TO THE FACULTIES OF THE EXTREMES AND THE MEAN TO
THE FACULTY OF THE MEAN
TRUE
THIS BEING PREMISED I WOULD ASK THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS OF OPINION THAT
THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE OR UNCHANGEABLE IDEA OF BEAUTY IN WHOSE OPINION
THE BEAUTIFUL IS THE MANIFOLD HE I SAY YOUR LOVER OF BEAUTIFUL
SIGHTS WHO CANNOT BEAR TO BE TOLD THAT THE BEAUTIFUL IS ONE AND THE
JUST IS ONE OR THAT ANYTHING IS ONE TO HIM I WOULD APPEAL SAYING
WILL YOU BE SO VERY KIND SIR AS TO TELL US WHETHER OF ALL THESE
BEAUTIFUL THINGS THERE IS ONE WHICH WILL NOT BE FOUND UGLY OR OF THE
JUST WHICH WILL NOT BE FOUND UNJUST OR OF THE HOLY WHICH WILL NOT
ALSO BE UNHOLY
NO HE REPLIED THE BEAUTIFUL WILL IN SOME POINT OF VIEW BE FOUND UGLY
AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE REST
AND MAY NOT THE MANY WHICH ARE DOUBLES BE ALSO HALVES DOUBLES THAT
IS OF ONE THING AND HALVES OF ANOTHER
QUITE TRUE
AND THINGS GREAT AND SMALL HEAVY AND LIGHT AS THEY ARE TERMED WILL
NOT BE DENOTED BY THESE ANY MORE THAN BY THE OPPOSITE NAMES
TRUE BOTH THESE AND THE OPPOSITE NAMES WILL ALWAYS ATTACH TO ALL OF
THEM
AND CAN ANY ONE OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH ARE CALLED BY PARTICULAR
NAMES BE SAID TO BE THIS RATHER THAN NOT TO BE THIS
HE REPLIED THEY ARE LIKE THE PUNNING RIDDLES WHICH ARE ASKED AT FEASTS
OR THE CHILDREN'S PUZZLE ABOUT THE EUNUCH AIMING AT THE BAT WITH
WHAT HE HIT HIM AS THEY SAY IN THE PUZZLE AND UPON WHAT THE BAT
WAS SITTING
THE INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS OF WHICH I AM SPEAKING ARE ALSO
A RIDDLE AND HAVE A DOUBLE SENSE NOR CAN YOU FIX THEM IN YOUR MIND
EITHER AS BEING OR NOT BEING OR BOTH OR NEITHER
THEN WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THEM I SAID
CAN THEY HAVE A BETTER PLACE
THAN BETWEEN BEING AND NOT BEING FOR THEY ARE CLEARLY NOT IN GREATER
DARKNESS OR NEGATION THAN NOT BEING OR MORE FULL OF LIGHT AND EXISTENCE
THAN BEING
THAT IS QUITE TRUE HE SAID
THUS THEN WE SEEM TO HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE MANY IDEAS WHICH THE
MULTITUDE ENTERTAIN ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL AND ABOUT ALL OTHER THINGS ARE
TOSSING ABOUT IN SOME REGION WHICH IS HALF WAY BETWEEN PURE BEING AND
PURE NOT BEING
WE HAVE
YES AND WE HAD BEFORE AGREED THAT ANYTHING OF THIS KIND WHICH WE MIGHT
FIND WAS TO BE DESCRIBED AS MATTER OF OPINION AND NOT AS MATTER OF
KNOWLEDGE BEING THE INTERMEDIATE FLUX WHICH IS CAUGHT AND DETAINED BY
THE INTERMEDIATE FACULTY
QUITE TRUE
THEN THOSE WHO SEE THE MANY BEAUTIFUL AND WHO YET NEITHER SEE ABSOLUTE
BEAUTY NOR CAN FOLLOW ANY GUIDE WHO POINTS THE WAY THITHER WHO SEE THE
MANY JUST AND NOT ABSOLUTE JUSTICE AND THE LIKE SUCH PERSONS MAY BE
SAID TO HAVE OPINION BUT NOT KNOWLEDGE
THAT IS CERTAIN
BUT THOSE WHO SEE THE ABSOLUTE AND ETERNAL AND IMMUTABLE MAY BE SAID TO
KNOW AND NOT TO HAVE OPINION ONLY
NEITHER CAN THAT BE DENIED
THE ONE LOVE AND EMBRACE THE SUBJECTS OF KNOWLEDGE THE OTHER THOSE OF
OPINION THE LATTER ARE THE SAME AS I DARE SAY YOU WILL REMEMBER WHO
LISTENED TO SWEET SOUNDS AND GAZED UPON FAIR COLOURS BUT WOULD NOT
TOLERATE THE EXISTENCE OF ABSOLUTE BEAUTY
YES I REMEMBER
SHALL WE THEN BE GUILTY OF ANY IMPROPRIETY IN CALLING THEM LOVERS OF
OPINION RATHER THAN LOVERS OF WISDOM AND WILL THEY BE VERY ANGRY WITH
US FOR THUS DESCRIBING THEM
I SHALL TELL THEM NOT TO BE ANGRY NO MAN SHOULD BE ANGRY AT WHAT IS
TRUE
BUT THOSE WHO LOVE THE TRUTH IN EACH THING ARE TO BE CALLED LOVERS OF
WISDOM AND NOT LOVERS OF OPINION
ASSUREDLY
BOOK VI
AND THUS GLAUCON AFTER THE ARGUMENT HAS GONE A WEARY WAY THE TRUE AND
THE FALSE PHILOSOPHERS HAVE AT LENGTH APPEARED IN VIEW
I DO NOT THINK HE SAID THAT THE WAY COULD HAVE BEEN SHORTENED
I SUPPOSE NOT I SAID AND YET I BELIEVE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD A BETTER
VIEW OF BOTH OF THEM IF THE DISCUSSION COULD HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO THIS
ONE SUBJECT AND IF THERE WERE NOT MANY OTHER QUESTIONS AWAITING US
WHICH HE WHO DESIRES TO SEE IN WHAT RESPECT THE LIFE OF THE JUST DIFFERS
FROM THAT OF THE UNJUST MUST CONSIDER
AND WHAT IS THE NEXT QUESTION HE ASKED
SURELY I SAID THE ONE WHICH FOLLOWS NEXT IN ORDER
INASMUCH AS
PHILOSOPHERS ONLY ARE ABLE TO GRASP THE ETERNAL AND UNCHANGEABLE
AND THOSE WHO WANDER IN THE REGION OF THE MANY AND VARIABLE ARE NOT
PHILOSOPHERS I MUST ASK YOU WHICH OF THE TWO CLASSES SHOULD BE THE
RULERS OF OUR STATE
AND HOW CAN WE RIGHTLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION
WHICHEVER OF THE TWO ARE BEST ABLE TO GUARD THE LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS OF
OUR STATE LET THEM BE OUR GUARDIANS
VERY GOOD
NEITHER I SAID CAN THERE BE ANY QUESTION THAT THE GUARDIAN WHO IS TO
KEEP ANYTHING SHOULD HAVE EYES RATHER THAN NO EYES
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF THAT
AND ARE NOT THOSE WHO ARE VERILY AND INDEED WANTING IN THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE TRUE BEING OF EACH THING AND WHO HAVE IN THEIR SOULS NO CLEAR
PATTERN AND ARE UNABLE AS WITH A PAINTER'S EYE TO LOOK AT THE ABSOLUTE
TRUTH AND TO THAT ORIGINAL TO REPAIR AND HAVING PERFECT VISION OF THE
OTHER WORLD TO ORDER THE LAWS ABOUT BEAUTY GOODNESS JUSTICE IN THIS
IF NOT ALREADY ORDERED AND TO GUARD AND PRESERVE THE ORDER OF THEM ARE
NOT SUCH PERSONS I ASK SIMPLY BLIND
TRULY HE REPLIED THEY ARE MUCH IN THAT CONDITION
AND SHALL THEY BE OUR GUARDIANS WHEN THERE ARE OTHERS WHO BESIDES BEING
THEIR EQUALS IN EXPERIENCE AND FALLING SHORT OF THEM IN NO PARTICULAR OF
VIRTUE ALSO KNOW THE VERY TRUTH OF EACH THING
THERE CAN BE NO REASON HE SAID FOR REJECTING THOSE WHO HAVE THIS
GREATEST OF ALL GREAT QUALITIES THEY MUST ALWAYS HAVE THE FIRST PLACE
UNLESS THEY FAIL IN SOME OTHER RESPECT
SUPPOSE THEN I SAID THAT WE DETERMINE HOW FAR THEY CAN UNITE THIS AND
THE OTHER EXCELLENCES
BY ALL MEANS
IN THE FIRST PLACE AS WE BEGAN BY OBSERVING THE NATURE OF THE
PHILOSOPHER HAS TO BE ASCERTAINED
WE MUST COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING
ABOUT HIM AND WHEN WE HAVE DONE SO THEN IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN WE
SHALL ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH AN UNION OF QUALITIES IS POSSIBLE AND
THAT THOSE IN WHOM THEY ARE UNITED AND THOSE ONLY SHOULD BE RULERS IN
THE STATE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
LET US SUPPOSE THAT PHILOSOPHICAL MINDS ALWAYS LOVE KNOWLEDGE OF A SORT
WHICH SHOWS THEM THE ETERNAL NATURE NOT VARYING FROM GENERATION AND
CORRUPTION
AGREED
AND FURTHER I SAID LET US AGREE THAT THEY ARE LOVERS OF ALL TRUE
BEING THERE IS NO PART WHETHER GREATER OR LESS OR MORE OR LESS
HONOURABLE WHICH THEY ARE WILLING TO RENOUNCE AS WE SAID BEFORE OF THE
LOVER AND THE MAN OF AMBITION
TRUE
AND IF THEY ARE TO BE WHAT WE WERE DESCRIBING IS THERE NOT ANOTHER
QUALITY WHICH THEY SHOULD ALSO POSSESS
WHAT QUALITY
TRUTHFULNESS THEY WILL NEVER INTENTIONALLY RECEIVE INTO THEIR MIND
FALSEHOOD WHICH IS THEIR DETESTATION AND THEY WILL LOVE THE TRUTH
YES THAT MAY BE SAFELY AFFIRMED OF THEM
'MAY BE MY FRIEND I REPLIED IS NOT THE WORD SAY RATHER 'MUST BE
AFFIRMED FOR HE WHOSE NATURE IS AMOROUS OF ANYTHING CANNOT HELP LOVING
ALL THAT BELONGS OR IS AKIN TO THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTIONS
RIGHT HE SAID
AND IS THERE ANYTHING MORE AKIN TO WISDOM THAN TRUTH
HOW CAN THERE BE
CAN THE SAME NATURE BE A LOVER OF WISDOM AND A LOVER OF FALSEHOOD
NEVER
THE TRUE LOVER OF LEARNING THEN MUST FROM HIS EARLIEST YOUTH AS FAR AS
IN HIM LIES DESIRE ALL TRUTH
ASSUREDLY
BUT THEN AGAIN AS WE KNOW BY EXPERIENCE HE WHOSE DESIRES ARE STRONG
IN ONE DIRECTION WILL HAVE THEM WEAKER IN OTHERS THEY WILL BE LIKE A
STREAM WHICH HAS BEEN DRAWN OFF INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
TRUE
HE WHOSE DESIRES ARE DRAWN TOWARDS KNOWLEDGE IN EVERY FORM WILL BE
ABSORBED IN THE PLEASURES OF THE SOUL AND WILL HARDLY FEEL BODILY
PLEASURE I MEAN IF HE BE A TRUE PHILOSOPHER AND NOT A SHAM ONE
THAT IS MOST CERTAIN
SUCH AN ONE IS SURE TO BE TEMPERATE AND THE REVERSE OF COVETOUS FOR THE
MOTIVES WHICH MAKE ANOTHER MAN DESIROUS OF HAVING AND SPENDING HAVE NO
PLACE IN HIS CHARACTER
VERY TRUE
ANOTHER CRITERION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL NATURE HAS ALSO TO BE CONSIDERED
WHAT IS THAT
THERE SHOULD BE NO SECRET CORNER OF ILLIBERALITY NOTHING CAN BE MORE
ANTAGONISTIC THAN MEANNESS TO A SOUL WHICH IS EVER LONGING AFTER THE
WHOLE OF THINGS BOTH DIVINE AND HUMAN
MOST TRUE HE REPLIED
THEN HOW CAN HE WHO HAS MAGNIFICENCE OF MIND AND IS THE SPECTATOR OF ALL
TIME AND ALL EXISTENCE THINK MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE
HE CANNOT
OR CAN SUCH AN ONE ACCOUNT DEATH FEARFUL
NO INDEED
THEN THE COWARDLY AND MEAN NATURE HAS NO PART IN TRUE PHILOSOPHY
CERTAINLY NOT
OR AGAIN CAN HE WHO IS HARMONIOUSLY CONSTITUTED WHO IS NOT COVETOUS OR
MEAN OR A BOASTER OR A COWARD CAN HE I SAY EVER BE UNJUST OR HARD
IN HIS DEALINGS
IMPOSSIBLE
THEN YOU WILL SOON OBSERVE WHETHER A MAN IS JUST AND GENTLE OR RUDE
AND UNSOCIABLE THESE ARE THE SIGNS WHICH DISTINGUISH EVEN IN YOUTH THE
PHILOSOPHICAL NATURE FROM THE UNPHILOSOPHICAL
TRUE
THERE IS ANOTHER POINT WHICH SHOULD BE REMARKED
WHAT POINT
WHETHER HE HAS OR HAS NOT A PLEASURE IN LEARNING FOR NO ONE WILL LOVE
THAT WHICH GIVES HIM PAIN AND IN WHICH AFTER MUCH TOIL HE MAKES LITTLE
PROGRESS
CERTAINLY NOT
AND AGAIN IF HE IS FORGETFUL AND RETAINS NOTHING OF WHAT HE LEARNS
WILL HE NOT BE AN EMPTY VESSEL
THAT IS CERTAIN
LABOURING IN VAIN HE MUST END IN HATING HIMSELF AND HIS FRUITLESS
OCCUPATION YES
THEN A SOUL WHICH FORGETS CANNOT BE RANKED AMONG GENUINE PHILOSOPHIC
NATURES WE MUST INSIST THAT THE PHILOSOPHER SHOULD HAVE A GOOD MEMORY
CERTAINLY
AND ONCE MORE THE INHARMONIOUS AND UNSEEMLY NATURE CAN ONLY TEND TO
DISPROPORTION
UNDOUBTEDLY
AND DO YOU CONSIDER TRUTH TO BE AKIN TO PROPORTION OR TO DISPROPORTION
TO PROPORTION
THEN BESIDES OTHER QUALITIES WE MUST TRY TO FIND A NATURALLY
WELL PROPORTIONED AND GRACIOUS MIND WHICH WILL MOVE SPONTANEOUSLY
TOWARDS THE TRUE BEING OF EVERYTHING
CERTAINLY
WELL AND DO NOT ALL THESE QUALITIES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ENUMERATING GO
TOGETHER AND ARE THEY NOT IN A MANNER NECESSARY TO A SOUL WHICH IS
TO HAVE A FULL AND PERFECT PARTICIPATION OF BEING
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY HE REPLIED
AND MUST NOT THAT BE A BLAMELESS STUDY WHICH HE ONLY CAN PURSUE WHO HAS
THE GIFT OF A GOOD MEMORY AND IS QUICK TO LEARN NOBLE GRACIOUS THE
FRIEND OF TRUTH JUSTICE COURAGE TEMPERANCE WHO ARE HIS KINDRED
THE GOD OF JEALOUSY HIMSELF HE SAID COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH SUCH A
STUDY
AND TO MEN LIKE HIM I SAID WHEN PERFECTED BY YEARS AND EDUCATION AND
TO THESE ONLY YOU WILL ENTRUST THE STATE
HERE ADEIMANTUS INTERPOSED AND SAID TO THESE STATEMENTS SOCRATES NO
ONE CAN OFFER A REPLY BUT WHEN YOU TALK IN THIS WAY A STRANGE FEELING
PASSES OVER THE MINDS OF YOUR HEARERS THEY FANCY THAT THEY ARE LED
ASTRAY A LITTLE AT EACH STEP IN THE ARGUMENT OWING TO THEIR OWN WANT OF
SKILL IN ASKING AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS THESE LITTLES ACCUMULATE AND
AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION THEY ARE FOUND TO HAVE SUSTAINED A MIGHTY
OVERTHROW AND ALL THEIR FORMER NOTIONS APPEAR TO BE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
AND AS UNSKILFUL PLAYERS OF DRAUGHTS ARE AT LAST SHUT UP BY THEIR
MORE SKILFUL ADVERSARIES AND HAVE NO PIECE TO MOVE SO THEY TOO FIND
THEMSELVES SHUT UP AT LAST FOR THEY HAVE NOTHING TO SAY IN THIS NEW
GAME OF WHICH WORDS ARE THE COUNTERS AND YET ALL THE TIME THEY ARE IN
THE RIGHT
THE OBSERVATION IS SUGGESTED TO ME BY WHAT IS NOW OCCURRING
FOR ANY ONE OF US MIGHT SAY THAT ALTHOUGH IN WORDS HE IS NOT ABLE
TO MEET YOU AT EACH STEP OF THE ARGUMENT HE SEES AS A FACT THAT THE
VOTARIES OF PHILOSOPHY WHEN THEY CARRY ON THE STUDY NOT ONLY IN YOUTH
AS A PART OF EDUCATION BUT AS THE PURSUIT OF THEIR MATURER YEARS MOST
OF THEM BECOME STRANGE MONSTERS NOT TO SAY UTTER ROGUES AND THAT THOSE
WHO MAY BE CONSIDERED THE BEST OF THEM ARE MADE USELESS TO THE WORLD BY
THE VERY STUDY WHICH YOU EXTOL
WELL AND DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE WHO SAY SO ARE WRONG
I CANNOT TELL HE REPLIED BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS YOUR
OPINION
HEAR MY ANSWER I AM OF OPINION THAT THEY ARE QUITE RIGHT
THEN HOW CAN YOU BE JUSTIFIED IN SAYING THAT CITIES WILL NOT CEASE FROM
EVIL UNTIL PHILOSOPHERS RULE IN THEM WHEN PHILOSOPHERS ARE ACKNOWLEDGED
BY US TO BE OF NO USE TO THEM
YOU ASK A QUESTION I SAID TO WHICH A REPLY CAN ONLY BE GIVEN IN A
PARABLE
YES SOCRATES AND THAT IS A WAY OF SPEAKING TO WHICH YOU ARE NOT AT ALL
ACCUSTOMED I SUPPOSE
I PERCEIVE I SAID THAT YOU ARE VASTLY AMUSED AT HAVING PLUNGED ME INTO
SUCH A HOPELESS DISCUSSION BUT NOW HEAR THE PARABLE AND THEN YOU WILL
BE STILL MORE AMUSED AT THE MEAGRENESS OF MY IMAGINATION FOR THE MANNER
IN WHICH THE BEST MEN ARE TREATED IN THEIR OWN STATES IS SO GRIEVOUS
THAT NO SINGLE THING ON EARTH IS COMPARABLE TO IT AND THEREFORE IF
I AM TO PLEAD THEIR CAUSE I MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO FICTION AND PUT
TOGETHER A FIGURE MADE UP OF MANY THINGS LIKE THE FABULOUS UNIONS OF
GOATS AND STAGS WHICH ARE FOUND IN PICTURES
IMAGINE THEN A FLEET OR A
SHIP IN WHICH THERE IS A CAPTAIN WHO IS TALLER AND STRONGER THAN ANY OF
THE CREW BUT HE IS A LITTLE DEAF AND HAS A SIMILAR INFIRMITY IN SIGHT
AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF NAVIGATION IS NOT MUCH BETTER
THE SAILORS ARE
QUARRELLING WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT THE STEERING EVERY ONE IS OF OPINION
THAT HE HAS A RIGHT TO STEER THOUGH HE HAS NEVER LEARNED THE ART OF
NAVIGATION AND CANNOT TELL WHO TAUGHT HIM OR WHEN HE LEARNED AND WILL
FURTHER ASSERT THAT IT CANNOT BE TAUGHT AND THEY ARE READY TO CUT IN
PIECES ANY ONE WHO SAYS THE CONTRARY
THEY THRONG ABOUT THE CAPTAIN
BEGGING AND PRAYING HIM TO COMMIT THE HELM TO THEM AND IF AT ANY TIME
THEY DO NOT PREVAIL BUT OTHERS ARE PREFERRED TO THEM THEY KILL THE
OTHERS OR THROW THEM OVERBOARD AND HAVING FIRST CHAINED UP THE NOBLE
CAPTAIN'S SENSES WITH DRINK OR SOME NARCOTIC DRUG THEY MUTINY AND TAKE
POSSESSION OF THE SHIP AND MAKE FREE WITH THE STORES THUS EATING
AND DRINKING THEY PROCEED ON THEIR VOYAGE IN SUCH MANNER AS MIGHT BE
EXPECTED OF THEM
HIM WHO IS THEIR PARTISAN AND CLEVERLY AIDS THEM IN
THEIR PLOT FOR GETTING THE SHIP OUT OF THE CAPTAIN'S HANDS INTO THEIR
OWN WHETHER BY FORCE OR PERSUASION THEY COMPLIMENT WITH THE NAME OF
SAILOR PILOT ABLE SEAMAN AND ABUSE THE OTHER SORT OF MAN WHOM THEY
CALL A GOOD FOR NOTHING BUT THAT THE TRUE PILOT MUST PAY ATTENTION
TO THE YEAR AND SEASONS AND SKY AND STARS AND WINDS AND WHATEVER ELSE
BELONGS TO HIS ART IF HE INTENDS TO BE REALLY QUALIFIED FOR THE COMMAND
OF A SHIP AND THAT HE MUST AND WILL BE THE STEERER WHETHER OTHER
PEOPLE LIKE OR NOT THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS UNION OF AUTHORITY WITH THE
STEERER'S ART HAS NEVER SERIOUSLY ENTERED INTO THEIR THOUGHTS OR BEEN
MADE PART OF THEIR CALLING
NOW IN VESSELS WHICH ARE IN A STATE OF
MUTINY AND BY SAILORS WHO ARE MUTINEERS HOW WILL THE TRUE PILOT BE
REGARDED WILL HE NOT BE CALLED BY THEM A PRATER A STAR GAZER A
GOOD FOR NOTHING
OF COURSE SAID ADEIMANTUS
THEN YOU WILL HARDLY NEED I SAID TO HEAR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE
FIGURE WHICH DESCRIBES THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER IN HIS RELATION TO THE
STATE FOR YOU UNDERSTAND ALREADY
CERTAINLY
THEN SUPPOSE YOU NOW TAKE THIS PARABLE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS SURPRISED
AT FINDING THAT PHILOSOPHERS HAVE NO HONOUR IN THEIR CITIES EXPLAIN
IT TO HIM AND TRY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT THEIR HAVING HONOUR WOULD BE FAR
MORE EXTRAORDINARY
I WILL
SAY TO HIM THAT IN DEEMING THE BEST VOTARIES OF PHILOSOPHY TO BE
USELESS TO THE REST OF THE WORLD HE IS RIGHT BUT ALSO TELL HIM TO
ATTRIBUTE THEIR USELESSNESS TO THE FAULT OF THOSE WHO WILL NOT USE THEM
AND NOT TO THEMSELVES
THE PILOT SHOULD NOT HUMBLY BEG THE SAILORS TO BE
COMMANDED BY HIM THAT IS NOT THE ORDER OF NATURE NEITHER ARE 'THE WISE
TO GO TO THE DOORS OF THE RICH' THE INGENIOUS AUTHOR OF THIS SAYING
TOLD A LIE BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN A MAN IS ILL WHETHER HE
BE RICH OR POOR TO THE PHYSICIAN HE MUST GO AND HE WHO WANTS TO
BE GOVERNED TO HIM WHO IS ABLE TO GOVERN
THE RULER WHO IS GOOD FOR
ANYTHING OUGHT NOT TO BEG HIS SUBJECTS TO BE RULED BY HIM ALTHOUGH
THE PRESENT GOVERNORS OF MANKIND ARE OF A DIFFERENT STAMP THEY MAY BE
JUSTLY COMPARED TO THE MUTINOUS SAILORS AND THE TRUE HELMSMEN TO THOSE
WHO ARE CALLED BY THEM GOOD FOR NOTHINGS AND STAR GAZERS
PRECISELY SO HE SAID
FOR THESE REASONS AND AMONG MEN LIKE THESE PHILOSOPHY THE NOBLEST
PURSUIT OF ALL IS NOT LIKELY TO BE MUCH ESTEEMED BY THOSE OF THE
OPPOSITE FACTION NOT THAT THE GREATEST AND MOST LASTING INJURY IS DONE
TO HER BY HER OPPONENTS BUT BY HER OWN PROFESSING FOLLOWERS THE SAME
OF WHOM YOU SUPPOSE THE ACCUSER TO SAY THAT THE GREATER NUMBER OF THEM
ARE ARRANT ROGUES AND THE BEST ARE USELESS IN WHICH OPINION I AGREED
YES
AND THE REASON WHY THE GOOD ARE USELESS HAS NOW BEEN EXPLAINED
TRUE
THEN SHALL WE PROCEED TO SHOW THAT THE CORRUPTION OF THE MAJORITY IS
ALSO UNAVOIDABLE AND THAT THIS IS NOT TO BE LAID TO THE CHARGE OF
PHILOSOPHY ANY MORE THAN THE OTHER
BY ALL MEANS
AND LET US ASK AND ANSWER IN TURN FIRST GOING BACK TO THE DESCRIPTION
OF THE GENTLE AND NOBLE NATURE
TRUTH AS YOU WILL REMEMBER WAS HIS
LEADER WHOM HE FOLLOWED ALWAYS AND IN ALL THINGS FAILING IN THIS HE
WAS AN IMPOSTOR AND HAD NO PART OR LOT IN TRUE PHILOSOPHY
YES THAT WAS SAID
WELL AND IS NOT THIS ONE QUALITY TO MENTION NO OTHERS GREATLY AT
VARIANCE WITH PRESENT NOTIONS OF HIM
CERTAINLY HE SAID
AND HAVE WE NOT A RIGHT TO SAY IN HIS DEFENCE THAT THE TRUE LOVER OF
KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS STRIVING AFTER BEING THAT IS HIS NATURE HE WILL
NOT REST IN THE MULTIPLICITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHICH IS AN APPEARANCE ONLY
BUT WILL GO ON THE KEEN EDGE WILL NOT BE BLUNTED NOR THE FORCE OF HIS
DESIRE ABATE UNTIL HE HAVE ATTAINED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUE NATURE
OF EVERY ESSENCE BY A SYMPATHETIC AND KINDRED POWER IN THE SOUL AND BY
THAT POWER DRAWING NEAR AND MINGLING AND BECOMING INCORPORATE WITH VERY
BEING HAVING BEGOTTEN MIND AND TRUTH HE WILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND WILL
LIVE AND GROW TRULY AND THEN AND NOT TILL THEN WILL HE CEASE FROM HIS
TRAVAIL
NOTHING HE SAID CAN BE MORE JUST THAN SUCH A DESCRIPTION OF HIM
AND WILL THE LOVE OF A LIE BE ANY PART OF A PHILOSOPHER'S NATURE WILL
HE NOT UTTERLY HATE A LIE
HE WILL
AND WHEN TRUTH IS THE CAPTAIN WE CANNOT SUSPECT ANY EVIL OF THE BAND
WHICH HE LEADS
IMPOSSIBLE
JUSTICE AND HEALTH OF MIND WILL BE OF THE COMPANY AND TEMPERANCE WILL
FOLLOW AFTER
TRUE HE REPLIED
NEITHER IS THERE ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD AGAIN SET IN ARRAY THE
PHILOSOPHER'S VIRTUES AS YOU WILL DOUBTLESS REMEMBER THAT COURAGE
MAGNIFICENCE APPREHENSION MEMORY WERE HIS NATURAL GIFTS
AND YOU
OBJECTED THAT ALTHOUGH NO ONE COULD DENY WHAT I THEN SAID STILL IF
YOU LEAVE WORDS AND LOOK AT FACTS THE PERSONS WHO ARE THUS DESCRIBED
ARE SOME OF THEM MANIFESTLY USELESS AND THE GREATER NUMBER UTTERLY
DEPRAVED WE WERE THEN LED TO ENQUIRE INTO THE GROUNDS OF THESE
ACCUSATIONS AND HAVE NOW ARRIVED AT THE POINT OF ASKING WHY ARE
THE MAJORITY BAD WHICH QUESTION OF NECESSITY BROUGHT US BACK TO THE
EXAMINATION AND DEFINITION OF THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER
EXACTLY
AND WE HAVE NEXT TO CONSIDER THE CORRUPTIONS OF THE PHILOSOPHIC NATURE
WHY SO MANY ARE SPOILED AND SO FEW ESCAPE SPOILING I AM SPEAKING OF
THOSE WHO WERE SAID TO BE USELESS BUT NOT WICKED AND WHEN WE HAVE DONE
WITH THEM WE WILL SPEAK OF THE IMITATORS OF PHILOSOPHY WHAT MANNER OF
MEN ARE THEY WHO ASPIRE AFTER A PROFESSION WHICH IS ABOVE THEM AND OF
WHICH THEY ARE UNWORTHY AND THEN BY THEIR MANIFOLD INCONSISTENCIES
BRING UPON PHILOSOPHY AND UPON ALL PHILOSOPHERS THAT UNIVERSAL
REPROBATION OF WHICH WE SPEAK
WHAT ARE THESE CORRUPTIONS HE SAID
I WILL SEE IF I CAN EXPLAIN THEM TO YOU
EVERY ONE WILL ADMIT THAT A
NATURE HAVING IN PERFECTION ALL THE QUALITIES WHICH WE REQUIRED IN A
PHILOSOPHER IS A RARE PLANT WHICH IS SELDOM SEEN AMONG MEN
RARE INDEED
AND WHAT NUMBERLESS AND POWERFUL CAUSES TEND TO DESTROY THESE RARE
NATURES
WHAT CAUSES
IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE THEIR OWN VIRTUES THEIR COURAGE
TEMPERANCE AND THE REST OF THEM EVERY ONE OF WHICH PRAISEWORTHY
QUALITIES AND THIS IS A MOST SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE DESTROYS AND
DISTRACTS FROM PHILOSOPHY THE SOUL WHICH IS THE POSSESSOR OF THEM
THAT IS VERY SINGULAR HE REPLIED
THEN THERE ARE ALL THE ORDINARY GOODS OF LIFE BEAUTY WEALTH STRENGTH
RANK AND GREAT CONNECTIONS IN THE STATE YOU UNDERSTAND THE SORT OF
THINGS THESE ALSO HAVE A CORRUPTING AND DISTRACTING EFFECT
I UNDERSTAND BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE PRECISELY WHAT YOU MEAN
ABOUT THEM
GRASP THE TRUTH AS A WHOLE I SAID AND IN THE RIGHT WAY YOU WILL THEN
HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN APPREHENDING THE PRECEDING REMARKS AND THEY WILL
NO LONGER APPEAR STRANGE TO YOU
AND HOW AM I TO DO SO HE ASKED
WHY I SAID WE KNOW THAT ALL GERMS OR SEEDS WHETHER VEGETABLE OR
ANIMAL WHEN THEY FAIL TO MEET WITH PROPER NUTRIMENT OR CLIMATE OR SOIL
IN PROPORTION TO THEIR VIGOUR ARE ALL THE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE WANT OF
A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR EVIL IS A GREATER ENEMY TO WHAT IS GOOD THAN
TO WHAT IS NOT
VERY TRUE
THERE IS REASON IN SUPPOSING THAT THE FINEST NATURES WHEN UNDER ALIEN
CONDITIONS RECEIVE MORE INJURY THAN THE INFERIOR BECAUSE THE CONTRAST
IS GREATER
CERTAINLY
AND MAY WE NOT SAY ADEIMANTUS THAT THE MOST GIFTED MINDS WHEN THEY
ARE ILL EDUCATED BECOME PRE EMINENTLY BAD DO NOT GREAT CRIMES AND
THE SPIRIT OF PURE EVIL SPRING OUT OF A FULNESS OF NATURE RUINED BY
EDUCATION RATHER THAN FROM ANY INFERIORITY WHEREAS WEAK NATURES ARE
SCARCELY CAPABLE OF ANY VERY GREAT GOOD OR VERY GREAT EVIL
THERE I THINK THAT YOU ARE RIGHT
AND OUR PHILOSOPHER FOLLOWS THE SAME ANALOGY HE IS LIKE A PLANT WHICH
HAVING PROPER NURTURE MUST NECESSARILY GROW AND MATURE INTO ALL VIRTUE
BUT IF SOWN AND PLANTED IN AN ALIEN SOIL BECOMES THE MOST NOXIOUS OF
ALL WEEDS UNLESS HE BE PRESERVED BY SOME DIVINE POWER
DO YOU REALLY
THINK AS PEOPLE SO OFTEN SAY THAT OUR YOUTH ARE CORRUPTED BY SOPHISTS
OR THAT PRIVATE TEACHERS OF THE ART CORRUPT THEM IN ANY DEGREE WORTH
SPEAKING OF ARE NOT THE PUBLIC WHO SAY THESE THINGS THE GREATEST OF ALL
SOPHISTS AND DO THEY NOT EDUCATE TO PERFECTION YOUNG AND OLD MEN AND
WOMEN ALIKE AND FASHION THEM AFTER THEIR OWN HEARTS
WHEN IS THIS ACCOMPLISHED HE SAID
WHEN THEY MEET TOGETHER AND THE WORLD SITS DOWN AT AN ASSEMBLY OR IN
A COURT OF LAW OR A THEATRE OR A CAMP OR IN ANY OTHER POPULAR RESORT
AND THERE IS A GREAT UPROAR AND THEY PRAISE SOME THINGS WHICH ARE
BEING SAID OR DONE AND BLAME OTHER THINGS EQUALLY EXAGGERATING BOTH
SHOUTING AND CLAPPING THEIR HANDS AND THE ECHO OF THE ROCKS AND THE
PLACE IN WHICH THEY ARE ASSEMBLED REDOUBLES THE SOUND OF THE PRAISE OR
BLAME AT SUCH A TIME WILL NOT A YOUNG MAN'S HEART AS THEY SAY LEAP
WITHIN HIM WILL ANY PRIVATE TRAINING ENABLE HIM TO STAND FIRM AGAINST
THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD OF POPULAR OPINION OR WILL HE BE CARRIED AWAY
BY THE STREAM WILL HE NOT HAVE THE NOTIONS OF GOOD AND EVIL WHICH THE
PUBLIC IN GENERAL HAVE HE WILL DO AS THEY DO AND AS THEY ARE SUCH
WILL HE BE
YES SOCRATES NECESSITY WILL COMPEL HIM
AND YET I SAID THERE IS A STILL GREATER NECESSITY WHICH HAS NOT BEEN
MENTIONED
WHAT IS THAT
THE GENTLE FORCE OF ATTAINDER OR CONFISCATION OR DEATH WHICH AS YOU
ARE AWARE THESE NEW SOPHISTS AND EDUCATORS WHO ARE THE PUBLIC APPLY
WHEN THEIR WORDS ARE POWERLESS
INDEED THEY DO AND IN RIGHT GOOD EARNEST
NOW WHAT OPINION OF ANY OTHER SOPHIST OR OF ANY PRIVATE PERSON CAN BE
EXPECTED TO OVERCOME IN SUCH AN UNEQUAL CONTEST
NONE HE REPLIED
NO INDEED I SAID EVEN TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT IS A GREAT PIECE OF FOLLY
THERE NEITHER IS NOR HAS BEEN NOR IS EVER LIKELY TO BE ANY DIFFERENT
TYPE OF CHARACTER WHICH HAS HAD NO OTHER TRAINING IN VIRTUE BUT THAT
WHICH IS SUPPLIED BY PUBLIC OPINION I SPEAK MY FRIEND OF HUMAN VIRTUE
ONLY WHAT IS MORE THAN HUMAN AS THE PROVERB SAYS IS NOT INCLUDED
FOR I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU IGNORANT THAT IN THE PRESENT EVIL STATE OF
GOVERNMENTS WHATEVER IS SAVED AND COMES TO GOOD IS SAVED BY THE POWER
OF GOD AS WE MAY TRULY SAY
I QUITE ASSENT HE REPLIED
THEN LET ME CRAVE YOUR ASSENT ALSO TO A FURTHER OBSERVATION
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY
WHY THAT ALL THOSE MERCENARY INDIVIDUALS WHOM THE MANY CALL SOPHISTS
AND WHOM THEY DEEM TO BE THEIR ADVERSARIES DO IN FACT TEACH NOTHING
BUT THE OPINION OF THE MANY THAT IS TO SAY THE OPINIONS OF THEIR
ASSEMBLIES AND THIS IS THEIR WISDOM
I MIGHT COMPARE THEM TO A MAN WHO
SHOULD STUDY THE TEMPERS AND DESIRES OF A MIGHTY STRONG BEAST WHO IS
FED BY HIM HE WOULD LEARN HOW TO APPROACH AND HANDLE HIM ALSO AT WHAT
TIMES AND FROM WHAT CAUSES HE IS DANGEROUS OR THE REVERSE AND WHAT
IS THE MEANING OF HIS SEVERAL CRIES AND BY WHAT SOUNDS WHEN ANOTHER
UTTERS THEM HE IS SOOTHED OR INFURIATED AND YOU MAY SUPPOSE FURTHER
THAT WHEN BY CONTINUALLY ATTENDING UPON HIM HE HAS BECOME PERFECT IN
ALL THIS HE CALLS HIS KNOWLEDGE WISDOM AND MAKES OF IT A SYSTEM OR
ART WHICH HE PROCEEDS TO TEACH ALTHOUGH HE HAS NO REAL NOTION OF WHAT
HE MEANS BY THE PRINCIPLES OR PASSIONS OF WHICH HE IS SPEAKING BUT
CALLS THIS HONOURABLE AND THAT DISHONOURABLE OR GOOD OR EVIL OR JUST
OR UNJUST ALL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TASTES AND TEMPERS OF THE GREAT
BRUTE
GOOD HE PRONOUNCES TO BE THAT IN WHICH THE BEAST DELIGHTS AND
EVIL TO BE THAT WHICH HE DISLIKES AND HE CAN GIVE NO OTHER ACCOUNT
OF THEM EXCEPT THAT THE JUST AND NOBLE ARE THE NECESSARY HAVING NEVER
HIMSELF SEEN AND HAVING NO POWER OF EXPLAINING TO OTHERS THE NATURE
OF EITHER OR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM WHICH IS IMMENSE
BY HEAVEN
WOULD NOT SUCH AN ONE BE A RARE EDUCATOR
INDEED HE WOULD
AND IN WHAT WAY DOES HE WHO THINKS THAT WISDOM IS THE DISCERNMENT OF
THE TEMPERS AND TASTES OF THE MOTLEY MULTITUDE WHETHER IN PAINTING
OR MUSIC OR FINALLY IN POLITICS DIFFER FROM HIM WHOM I HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBING FOR WHEN A MAN CONSORTS WITH THE MANY AND EXHIBITS TO
THEM HIS POEM OR OTHER WORK OF ART OR THE SERVICE WHICH HE HAS DONE
THE STATE MAKING THEM HIS JUDGES WHEN HE IS NOT OBLIGED THE SO CALLED
NECESSITY OF DIOMEDE WILL OBLIGE HIM TO PRODUCE WHATEVER THEY
PRAISE
AND YET THE REASONS ARE UTTERLY LUDICROUS WHICH THEY GIVE IN
CONFIRMATION OF THEIR OWN NOTIONS ABOUT THE HONOURABLE AND GOOD
DID YOU
EVER HEAR ANY OF THEM WHICH WERE NOT
NO NOR AM I LIKELY TO HEAR
YOU RECOGNISE THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING THEN LET ME ASK YOU
TO CONSIDER FURTHER WHETHER THE WORLD WILL EVER BE INDUCED TO BELIEVE IN
THE EXISTENCE OF ABSOLUTE BEAUTY RATHER THAN OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL OR
OF THE ABSOLUTE IN EACH KIND RATHER THAN OF THE MANY IN EACH KIND
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN THE WORLD CANNOT POSSIBLY BE A PHILOSOPHER
IMPOSSIBLE
AND THEREFORE PHILOSOPHERS MUST INEVITABLY FALL UNDER THE CENSURE OF THE
WORLD
THEY MUST
AND OF INDIVIDUALS WHO CONSORT WITH THE MOB AND SEEK TO PLEASE THEM
THAT IS EVIDENT
THEN DO YOU SEE ANY WAY IN WHICH THE PHILOSOPHER CAN BE PRESERVED IN
HIS CALLING TO THE END AND REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE SAYING OF HIM THAT
HE WAS TO HAVE QUICKNESS AND MEMORY AND COURAGE AND MAGNIFICENCE THESE
WERE ADMITTED BY US TO BE THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER'S GIFTS
YES
WILL NOT SUCH AN ONE FROM HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD BE IN ALL THINGS FIRST
AMONG ALL ESPECIALLY IF HIS BODILY ENDOWMENTS ARE LIKE HIS MENTAL ONES
CERTAINLY HE SAID
AND HIS FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS WILL WANT TO USE HIM AS HE GETS
OLDER FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
NO QUESTION
FALLING AT HIS FEET THEY WILL MAKE REQUESTS TO HIM AND DO HIM HONOUR
AND FLATTER HIM BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET INTO THEIR HANDS NOW THE
POWER WHICH HE WILL ONE DAY POSSESS
THAT OFTEN HAPPENS HE SAID
AND WHAT WILL A MAN SUCH AS HE IS BE LIKELY TO DO UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY IF HE BE A CITIZEN OF A GREAT CITY RICH
AND NOBLE AND A TALL PROPER YOUTH WILL HE NOT BE FULL OF BOUNDLESS
ASPIRATIONS AND FANCY HIMSELF ABLE TO MANAGE THE AFFAIRS OF HELLENES
AND OF BARBARIANS AND HAVING GOT SUCH NOTIONS INTO HIS HEAD WILL HE
NOT DILATE AND ELEVATE HIMSELF IN THE FULNESS OF VAIN POMP AND SENSELESS
PRIDE
TO BE SURE HE WILL
NOW WHEN HE IS IN THIS STATE OF MIND IF SOME ONE GENTLY COMES TO HIM
AND TELLS HIM THAT HE IS A FOOL AND MUST GET UNDERSTANDING WHICH CAN
ONLY BE GOT BY SLAVING FOR IT DO YOU THINK THAT UNDER SUCH ADVERSE
CIRCUMSTANCES HE WILL BE EASILY INDUCED TO LISTEN
FAR OTHERWISE
AND EVEN IF THERE BE SOME ONE WHO THROUGH INHERENT GOODNESS OR NATURAL
REASONABLENESS HAS HAD HIS EYES OPENED A LITTLE AND IS HUMBLED AND TAKEN
CAPTIVE BY PHILOSOPHY HOW WILL HIS FRIENDS BEHAVE WHEN THEY THINK THAT
THEY ARE LIKELY TO LOSE THE ADVANTAGE WHICH THEY WERE HOPING TO REAP
FROM HIS COMPANIONSHIP WILL THEY NOT DO AND SAY ANYTHING TO PREVENT HIM
FROM YIELDING TO HIS BETTER NATURE AND TO RENDER HIS TEACHER POWERLESS
USING TO THIS END PRIVATE INTRIGUES AS WELL AS PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT
AND HOW CAN ONE WHO IS THUS CIRCUMSTANCED EVER BECOME A PHILOSOPHER
IMPOSSIBLE
THEN WERE WE NOT RIGHT IN SAYING THAT EVEN THE VERY QUALITIES WHICH
MAKE A MAN A PHILOSOPHER MAY IF HE BE ILL EDUCATED DIVERT HIM FROM
PHILOSOPHY NO LESS THAN RICHES AND THEIR ACCOMPANIMENTS AND THE OTHER
SO CALLED GOODS OF LIFE
WE WERE QUITE RIGHT
THUS MY EXCELLENT FRIEND IS BROUGHT ABOUT ALL THAT RUIN AND FAILURE
WHICH I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING OF THE NATURES BEST ADAPTED TO THE BEST OF
ALL PURSUITS THEY ARE NATURES WHICH WE MAINTAIN TO BE RARE AT ANY TIME
THIS BEING THE CLASS OUT OF WHICH COME THE MEN WHO ARE THE AUTHORS OF
THE GREATEST EVIL TO STATES AND INDIVIDUALS AND ALSO OF THE GREATEST
GOOD WHEN THE TIDE CARRIES THEM IN THAT DIRECTION BUT A SMALL MAN NEVER
WAS THE DOER OF ANY GREAT THING EITHER TO INDIVIDUALS OR TO STATES
THAT IS MOST TRUE HE SAID
AND SO PHILOSOPHY IS LEFT DESOLATE WITH HER MARRIAGE RITE INCOMPLETE
FOR HER OWN HAVE FALLEN AWAY AND FORSAKEN HER AND WHILE THEY ARE
LEADING A FALSE AND UNBECOMING LIFE OTHER UNWORTHY PERSONS SEEING THAT
SHE HAS NO KINSMEN TO BE HER PROTECTORS ENTER IN AND DISHONOUR HER AND
FASTEN UPON HER THE REPROACHES WHICH AS YOU SAY HER REPROVERS UTTER
WHO AFFIRM OF HER VOTARIES THAT SOME ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING AND THAT THE
GREATER NUMBER DESERVE THE SEVEREST PUNISHMENT
THAT IS CERTAINLY WHAT PEOPLE SAY
YES AND WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU EXPECT I SAID WHEN YOU THINK OF THE PUNY
CREATURES WHO SEEING THIS LAND OPEN TO THEM A LAND WELL STOCKED WITH
FAIR NAMES AND SHOWY TITLES LIKE PRISONERS RUNNING OUT OF PRISON INTO A
SANCTUARY TAKE A LEAP OUT OF THEIR TRADES INTO PHILOSOPHY THOSE WHO
DO SO BEING PROBABLY THE CLEVEREST HANDS AT THEIR OWN MISERABLE CRAFTS
FOR ALTHOUGH PHILOSOPHY BE IN THIS EVIL CASE STILL THERE REMAINS A
DIGNITY ABOUT HER WHICH IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE ARTS
AND MANY ARE
THUS ATTRACTED BY HER WHOSE NATURES ARE IMPERFECT AND WHOSE SOULS ARE
MAIMED AND DISFIGURED BY THEIR MEANNESSES AS THEIR BODIES ARE BY THEIR
TRADES AND CRAFTS
IS NOT THIS UNAVOIDABLE
YES
ARE THEY NOT EXACTLY LIKE A BALD LITTLE TINKER WHO HAS JUST GOT OUT OF
DURANCE AND COME INTO A FORTUNE HE TAKES A BATH AND PUTS ON A NEW COAT
AND IS DECKED OUT AS A BRIDEGROOM GOING TO MARRY HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER
WHO IS LEFT POOR AND DESOLATE
A MOST EXACT PARALLEL
WHAT WILL BE THE ISSUE OF SUCH MARRIAGES WILL THEY NOT BE VILE AND
BASTARD
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION OF IT
AND WHEN PERSONS WHO ARE UNWORTHY OF EDUCATION APPROACH PHILOSOPHY AND
MAKE AN ALLIANCE WITH HER WHO IS IN A RANK ABOVE THEM WHAT SORT OF
IDEAS AND OPINIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE GENERATED WILL THEY NOT BE SOPHISMS
CAPTIVATING TO THE EAR HAVING NOTHING IN THEM GENUINE OR WORTHY OF OR
AKIN TO TRUE WISDOM
NO DOUBT HE SAID
THEN ADEIMANTUS I SAID THE WORTHY DISCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY WILL BE BUT
A SMALL REMNANT PERCHANCE SOME NOBLE AND WELL EDUCATED PERSON DETAINED
BY EXILE IN HER SERVICE WHO IN THE ABSENCE OF CORRUPTING INFLUENCES
REMAINS DEVOTED TO HER OR SOME LOFTY SOUL BORN IN A MEAN CITY THE
POLITICS OF WHICH HE CONTEMNS AND NEGLECTS AND THERE MAY BE A GIFTED
FEW WHO LEAVE THE ARTS WHICH THEY JUSTLY DESPISE AND COME TO HER OR
PERADVENTURE THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE RESTRAINED BY OUR FRIEND THEAGES'
BRIDLE FOR EVERYTHING IN THE LIFE OF THEAGES CONSPIRED TO DIVERT HIM
FROM PHILOSOPHY BUT ILL HEALTH KEPT HIM AWAY FROM POLITICS
MY OWN CASE
OF THE INTERNAL SIGN IS HARDLY WORTH MENTIONING FOR RARELY IF EVER
HAS SUCH A MONITOR BEEN GIVEN TO ANY OTHER MAN
THOSE WHO BELONG TO THIS
SMALL CLASS HAVE TASTED HOW SWEET AND BLESSED A POSSESSION PHILOSOPHY
IS AND HAVE ALSO SEEN ENOUGH OF THE MADNESS OF THE MULTITUDE AND THEY
KNOW THAT NO POLITICIAN IS HONEST NOR IS THERE ANY CHAMPION OF JUSTICE
AT WHOSE SIDE THEY MAY FIGHT AND BE SAVED
SUCH AN ONE MAY BE COMPARED
TO A MAN WHO HAS FALLEN AMONG WILD BEASTS HE WILL NOT JOIN IN THE
WICKEDNESS OF HIS FELLOWS BUT NEITHER IS HE ABLE SINGLY TO RESIST ALL
THEIR FIERCE NATURES AND THEREFORE SEEING THAT HE WOULD BE OF NO USE TO
THE STATE OR TO HIS FRIENDS AND REFLECTING THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO THROW
AWAY HIS LIFE WITHOUT DOING ANY GOOD EITHER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS HE
HOLDS HIS PEACE AND GOES HIS OWN WAY
HE IS LIKE ONE WHO IN THE STORM
OF DUST AND SLEET WHICH THE DRIVING WIND HURRIES ALONG RETIRES
UNDER THE SHELTER OF A WALL AND SEEING THE REST OF MANKIND FULL OF
WICKEDNESS HE IS CONTENT IF ONLY HE CAN LIVE HIS OWN LIFE AND BE PURE
FROM EVIL OR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS AND DEPART IN PEACE AND GOOD WILL WITH
BRIGHT HOPES
YES HE SAID AND HE WILL HAVE DONE A GREAT WORK BEFORE HE DEPARTS
A GREAT WORK YES BUT NOT THE GREATEST UNLESS HE FIND A STATE SUITABLE
TO HIM FOR IN A STATE WHICH IS SUITABLE TO HIM HE WILL HAVE A LARGER
GROWTH AND BE THE SAVIOUR OF HIS COUNTRY AS WELL AS OF HIMSELF
THE CAUSES WHY PHILOSOPHY IS IN SUCH AN EVIL NAME HAVE NOW BEEN
SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED THE INJUSTICE OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HER HAS
BEEN SHOWN IS THERE ANYTHING MORE WHICH YOU WISH TO SAY
NOTHING MORE ON THAT SUBJECT HE REPLIED BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHICH OF THE GOVERNMENTS NOW EXISTING IS IN YOUR OPINION THE ONE ADAPTED
TO HER
NOT ANY OF THEM I SAID AND THAT IS PRECISELY THE ACCUSATION WHICH I
BRING AGAINST THEM NOT ONE OF THEM IS WORTHY OF THE PHILOSOPHIC NATURE
AND HENCE THAT NATURE IS WARPED AND ESTRANGED AS THE EXOTIC SEED
WHICH IS SOWN IN A FOREIGN LAND BECOMES DENATURALIZED AND IS WONT TO BE
OVERPOWERED AND TO LOSE ITSELF IN THE NEW SOIL EVEN SO THIS GROWTH
OF PHILOSOPHY INSTEAD OF PERSISTING DEGENERATES AND RECEIVES ANOTHER
CHARACTER
BUT IF PHILOSOPHY EVER FINDS IN THE STATE THAT PERFECTION
WHICH SHE HERSELF IS THEN WILL BE SEEN THAT SHE IS IN TRUTH DIVINE AND
THAT ALL OTHER THINGS WHETHER NATURES OF MEN OR INSTITUTIONS ARE BUT
HUMAN AND NOW I KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK WHAT THAT STATE IS
NO HE SAID THERE YOU ARE WRONG FOR I WAS GOING TO ASK ANOTHER
QUESTION WHETHER IT IS THE STATE OF WHICH WE ARE THE FOUNDERS AND
INVENTORS OR SOME OTHER
YES I REPLIED OURS IN MOST RESPECTS BUT YOU MAY REMEMBER MY SAYING
BEFORE THAT SOME LIVING AUTHORITY WOULD ALWAYS BE REQUIRED IN THE
STATE HAVING THE SAME IDEA OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH GUIDED YOU WHEN AS
LEGISLATOR YOU WERE LAYING DOWN THE LAWS
THAT WAS SAID HE REPLIED
YES BUT NOT IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER YOU FRIGHTENED US BY INTERPOSING
OBJECTIONS WHICH CERTAINLY SHOWED THAT THE DISCUSSION WOULD BE LONG AND
DIFFICULT AND WHAT STILL REMAINS IS THE REVERSE OF EASY
WHAT IS THERE REMAINING
THE QUESTION HOW THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY MAY BE SO ORDERED AS NOT TO BE
THE RUIN OF THE STATE ALL GREAT ATTEMPTS ARE ATTENDED WITH RISK 'HARD
IS THE GOOD AS MEN SAY
STILL HE SAID LET THE POINT BE CLEARED UP AND THE ENQUIRY WILL THEN
BE COMPLETE
I SHALL NOT BE HINDERED I SAID BY ANY WANT OF WILL BUT IF AT ALL
BY A WANT OF POWER MY ZEAL YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELVES AND PLEASE TO
REMARK IN WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SAY HOW BOLDLY AND UNHESITATINGLY I DECLARE
THAT STATES SHOULD PURSUE PHILOSOPHY NOT AS THEY DO NOW BUT IN A
DIFFERENT SPIRIT
IN WHAT MANNER
AT PRESENT I SAID THE STUDENTS OF PHILOSOPHY ARE QUITE YOUNG
BEGINNING WHEN THEY ARE HARDLY PAST CHILDHOOD THEY DEVOTE ONLY THE TIME
SAVED FROM MONEYMAKING AND HOUSEKEEPING TO SUCH PURSUITS AND EVEN THOSE
OF THEM WHO ARE REPUTED TO HAVE MOST OF THE PHILOSOPHIC SPIRIT WHEN
THEY COME WITHIN SIGHT OF THE GREAT DIFFICULTY OF THE SUBJECT I MEAN
DIALECTIC TAKE THEMSELVES OFF
IN AFTER LIFE WHEN INVITED BY SOME ONE
ELSE THEY MAY PERHAPS GO AND HEAR A LECTURE AND ABOUT THIS THEY MAKE
MUCH ADO FOR PHILOSOPHY IS NOT CONSIDERED BY THEM TO BE THEIR
PROPER BUSINESS AT LAST WHEN THEY GROW OLD IN MOST CASES THEY ARE
EXTINGUISHED MORE TRULY THAN HERACLEITUS' SUN INASMUCH AS THEY NEVER
LIGHT UP AGAIN
HERACLITUS SAID THAT THE SUN WAS EXTINGUISHED EVERY
EVENING AND RELIGHTED EVERY MORNING
BUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE THEIR COURSE
JUST THE OPPOSITE
IN CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH THEIR STUDY AND WHAT
PHILOSOPHY THEY LEARN SHOULD BE SUITED TO THEIR TENDER YEARS DURING
THIS PERIOD WHILE THEY ARE GROWING UP TOWARDS MANHOOD THE CHIEF AND
SPECIAL CARE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THEIR BODIES THAT THEY MAY HAVE THEM
TO USE IN THE SERVICE OF PHILOSOPHY AS LIFE ADVANCES AND THE INTELLECT
BEGINS TO MATURE LET THEM INCREASE THE GYMNASTICS OF THE SOUL BUT
WHEN THE STRENGTH OF OUR CITIZENS FAILS AND IS PAST CIVIL AND MILITARY
DUTIES THEN LET THEM RANGE AT WILL AND ENGAGE IN NO SERIOUS LABOUR
AS WE INTEND THEM TO LIVE HAPPILY HERE AND TO CROWN THIS LIFE WITH A
SIMILAR HAPPINESS IN ANOTHER
HOW TRULY IN EARNEST YOU ARE SOCRATES HE SAID I AM SURE OF THAT AND
YET MOST OF YOUR HEARERS IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN ARE LIKELY TO BE STILL
MORE EARNEST IN THEIR OPPOSITION TO YOU AND WILL NEVER BE CONVINCED
THRASYMACHUS LEAST OF ALL
DO NOT MAKE A QUARREL I SAID BETWEEN THRASYMACHUS AND ME WHO HAVE
RECENTLY BECOME FRIENDS ALTHOUGH INDEED WE WERE NEVER ENEMIES FOR I
SHALL GO ON STRIVING TO THE UTMOST UNTIL I EITHER CONVERT HIM AND OTHER
MEN OR DO SOMETHING WHICH MAY PROFIT THEM AGAINST THE DAY WHEN THEY
LIVE AGAIN AND HOLD THE LIKE DISCOURSE IN ANOTHER STATE OF EXISTENCE
YOU ARE SPEAKING OF A TIME WHICH IS NOT VERY NEAR
RATHER I REPLIED OF A TIME WHICH IS AS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH
ETERNITY
NEVERTHELESS I DO NOT WONDER THAT THE MANY REFUSE TO BELIEVE
FOR THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT OF WHICH WE ARE NOW SPEAKING REALIZED
THEY HAVE SEEN ONLY A CONVENTIONAL IMITATION OF PHILOSOPHY CONSISTING
OF WORDS ARTIFICIALLY BROUGHT TOGETHER NOT LIKE THESE OF OURS HAVING
A NATURAL UNITY
BUT A HUMAN BEING WHO IN WORD AND WORK IS PERFECTLY
MOULDED AS FAR AS HE CAN BE INTO THE PROPORTION AND LIKENESS OF
VIRTUE SUCH A MAN RULING IN A CITY WHICH BEARS THE SAME IMAGE THEY
HAVE NEVER YET SEEN NEITHER ONE NOR MANY OF THEM DO YOU THINK THAT
THEY EVER DID
NO INDEED
NO MY FRIEND AND THEY HAVE SELDOM IF EVER HEARD FREE AND NOBLE
SENTIMENTS SUCH AS MEN UTTER WHEN THEY ARE EARNESTLY AND BY EVERY MEANS
IN THEIR POWER SEEKING AFTER TRUTH FOR THE SAKE OF KNOWLEDGE WHILE
THEY LOOK COLDLY ON THE SUBTLETIES OF CONTROVERSY OF WHICH THE END IS
OPINION AND STRIFE WHETHER THEY MEET WITH THEM IN THE COURTS OF LAW OR
IN SOCIETY
THEY ARE STRANGERS HE SAID TO THE WORDS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK
AND THIS WAS WHAT WE FORESAW AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY TRUTH FORCED
US TO ADMIT NOT WITHOUT FEAR AND HESITATION THAT NEITHER CITIES NOR
STATES NOR INDIVIDUALS WILL EVER ATTAIN PERFECTION UNTIL THE SMALL
CLASS OF PHILOSOPHERS WHOM WE TERMED USELESS BUT NOT CORRUPT ARE
PROVIDENTIALLY COMPELLED WHETHER THEY WILL OR NOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE
STATE AND UNTIL A LIKE NECESSITY BE LAID ON THE STATE TO OBEY THEM OR
UNTIL KINGS OR IF NOT KINGS THE SONS OF KINGS OR PRINCES ARE DIVINELY
INSPIRED WITH A TRUE LOVE OF TRUE PHILOSOPHY
THAT EITHER OR BOTH OF
THESE ALTERNATIVES ARE IMPOSSIBLE I SEE NO REASON TO AFFIRM IF
THEY WERE SO WE MIGHT INDEED BE JUSTLY RIDICULED AS DREAMERS AND
VISIONARIES
AM I NOT RIGHT
QUITE RIGHT
IF THEN IN THE COUNTLESS AGES OF THE PAST OR AT THE PRESENT HOUR IN
SOME FOREIGN CLIME WHICH IS FAR AWAY AND BEYOND OUR KEN THE PERFECTED
PHILOSOPHER IS OR HAS BEEN OR HEREAFTER SHALL BE COMPELLED BY A SUPERIOR
POWER TO HAVE THE CHARGE OF THE STATE WE ARE READY TO ASSERT TO THE
DEATH THAT THIS OUR CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN AND IS YEA AND WILL BE
WHENEVER THE MUSE OF PHILOSOPHY IS QUEEN
THERE IS NO IMPOSSIBILITY IN
ALL THIS THAT THERE IS A DIFFICULTY WE ACKNOWLEDGE OURSELVES
MY OPINION AGREES WITH YOURS HE SAID
BUT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THIS IS NOT THE OPINION OF THE MULTITUDE
I SHOULD IMAGINE NOT HE REPLIED
O MY FRIEND I SAID DO NOT ATTACK THE MULTITUDE THEY WILL CHANGE THEIR
MINDS IF NOT IN AN AGGRESSIVE SPIRIT BUT GENTLY AND WITH THE VIEW
OF SOOTHING THEM AND REMOVING THEIR DISLIKE OF OVER EDUCATION YOU SHOW
THEM YOUR PHILOSOPHERS AS THEY REALLY ARE AND DESCRIBE AS YOU WERE JUST
NOW DOING THEIR CHARACTER AND PROFESSION AND THEN MANKIND WILL SEE THAT
HE OF WHOM YOU ARE SPEAKING IS NOT SUCH AS THEY SUPPOSED IF THEY VIEW
HIM IN THIS NEW LIGHT THEY WILL SURELY CHANGE THEIR NOTION OF HIM AND
ANSWER IN ANOTHER STRAIN
WHO CAN BE AT ENMITY WITH ONE WHO LOVES THEM
WHO THAT IS HIMSELF GENTLE AND FREE FROM ENVY WILL BE JEALOUS OF ONE
IN WHOM THERE IS NO JEALOUSY NAY LET ME ANSWER FOR YOU THAT IN A FEW
THIS HARSH TEMPER MAY BE FOUND BUT NOT IN THE MAJORITY OF MANKIND
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU HE SAID
AND DO YOU NOT ALSO THINK AS I DO THAT THE HARSH FEELING WHICH THE
MANY ENTERTAIN TOWARDS PHILOSOPHY ORIGINATES IN THE PRETENDERS WHO RUSH
IN UNINVITED AND ARE ALWAYS ABUSING THEM AND FINDING FAULT WITH THEM
WHO MAKE PERSONS INSTEAD OF THINGS THE THEME OF THEIR CONVERSATION AND
NOTHING CAN BE MORE UNBECOMING IN PHILOSOPHERS THAN THIS
IT IS MOST UNBECOMING
FOR HE ADEIMANTUS WHOSE MIND IS FIXED UPON TRUE BEING HAS SURELY NO
TIME TO LOOK DOWN UPON THE AFFAIRS OF EARTH OR TO BE FILLED WITH MALICE
AND ENVY CONTENDING AGAINST MEN HIS EYE IS EVER DIRECTED TOWARDS
THINGS FIXED AND IMMUTABLE WHICH HE SEES NEITHER INJURING NOR INJURED
BY ONE ANOTHER BUT ALL IN ORDER MOVING ACCORDING TO REASON THESE HE
IMITATES AND TO THESE HE WILL AS FAR AS HE CAN CONFORM HIMSELF
CAN A
MAN HELP IMITATING THAT WITH WHICH HE HOLDS REVERENTIAL CONVERSE
IMPOSSIBLE
AND THE PHILOSOPHER HOLDING CONVERSE WITH THE DIVINE ORDER BECOMES
ORDERLY AND DIVINE AS FAR AS THE NATURE OF MAN ALLOWS BUT LIKE EVERY
ONE ELSE HE WILL SUFFER FROM DETRACTION
OF COURSE
AND IF A NECESSITY BE LAID UPON HIM OF FASHIONING NOT ONLY HIMSELF
BUT HUMAN NATURE GENERALLY WHETHER IN STATES OR INDIVIDUALS INTO
THAT WHICH HE BEHOLDS ELSEWHERE WILL HE THINK YOU BE AN UNSKILFUL
ARTIFICER OF JUSTICE TEMPERANCE AND EVERY CIVIL VIRTUE
ANYTHING BUT UNSKILFUL
AND IF THE WORLD PERCEIVES THAT WHAT WE ARE SAYING ABOUT HIM IS THE
TRUTH WILL THEY BE ANGRY WITH PHILOSOPHY WILL THEY DISBELIEVE US WHEN
WE TELL THEM THAT NO STATE CAN BE HAPPY WHICH IS NOT DESIGNED BY ARTISTS
WHO IMITATE THE HEAVENLY PATTERN
THEY WILL NOT BE ANGRY IF THEY UNDERSTAND HE SAID
BUT HOW WILL THEY
DRAW OUT THE PLAN OF WHICH YOU ARE SPEAKING
THEY WILL BEGIN BY TAKING THE STATE AND THE MANNERS OF MEN FROM WHICH
AS FROM A TABLET THEY WILL RUB OUT THE PICTURE AND LEAVE A CLEAN
SURFACE
THIS IS NO EASY TASK
BUT WHETHER EASY OR NOT HEREIN WILL LIE
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND EVERY OTHER LEGISLATOR THEY WILL HAVE
NOTHING TO DO EITHER WITH INDIVIDUAL OR STATE AND WILL INSCRIBE NO
LAWS UNTIL THEY HAVE EITHER FOUND OR THEMSELVES MADE A CLEAN SURFACE
THEY WILL BE VERY RIGHT HE SAID
HAVING EFFECTED THIS THEY WILL PROCEED TO TRACE AN OUTLINE OF THE
CONSTITUTION
NO DOUBT
AND WHEN THEY ARE FILLING IN THE WORK AS I CONCEIVE THEY WILL OFTEN
TURN THEIR EYES UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS I MEAN THAT THEY WILL FIRST LOOK
AT ABSOLUTE JUSTICE AND BEAUTY AND TEMPERANCE AND AGAIN AT THE HUMAN
COPY AND WILL MINGLE AND TEMPER THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF LIFE INTO THE
IMAGE OF A MAN AND THIS THEY WILL CONCEIVE ACCORDING TO THAT OTHER
IMAGE WHICH WHEN EXISTING AMONG MEN HOMER CALLS THE FORM AND LIKENESS
OF GOD
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND ONE FEATURE THEY WILL ERASE AND ANOTHER THEY WILL PUT IN UNTIL
THEY HAVE MADE THE WAYS OF MEN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AGREEABLE TO THE
WAYS OF GOD
INDEED HE SAID IN NO WAY COULD THEY MAKE A FAIRER PICTURE
AND NOW I SAID ARE WE BEGINNING TO PERSUADE THOSE WHOM YOU DESCRIBED
AS RUSHING AT US WITH MIGHT AND MAIN THAT THE PAINTER OF CONSTITUTIONS
IS SUCH AN ONE AS WE ARE PRAISING AT WHOM THEY WERE SO VERY INDIGNANT
BECAUSE TO HIS HANDS WE COMMITTED THE STATE AND ARE THEY GROWING A
LITTLE CALMER AT WHAT THEY HAVE JUST HEARD
MUCH CALMER IF THERE IS ANY SENSE IN THEM
WHY WHERE CAN THEY STILL FIND ANY GROUND FOR OBJECTION WILL THEY DOUBT
THAT THE PHILOSOPHER IS A LOVER OF TRUTH AND BEING
THEY WOULD NOT BE SO UNREASONABLE
OR THAT HIS NATURE BEING SUCH AS WE HAVE DELINEATED IS AKIN TO THE
HIGHEST GOOD
NEITHER CAN THEY DOUBT THIS
BUT AGAIN WILL THEY TELL US THAT SUCH A NATURE PLACED UNDER FAVOURABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NOT BE PERFECTLY GOOD AND WISE IF ANY EVER WAS OR
WILL THEY PREFER THOSE WHOM WE HAVE REJECTED
SURELY NOT
THEN WILL THEY STILL BE ANGRY AT OUR SAYING THAT UNTIL PHILOSOPHERS
BEAR RULE STATES AND INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE NO REST FROM EVIL NOR WILL
THIS OUR IMAGINARY STATE EVER BE REALIZED
I THINK THAT THEY WILL BE LESS ANGRY
SHALL WE ASSUME THAT THEY ARE NOT ONLY LESS ANGRY BUT QUITE GENTLE
AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AND FOR VERY SHAME IF FOR NO OTHER
REASON CANNOT REFUSE TO COME TO TERMS
BY ALL MEANS HE SAID
THEN LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE RECONCILIATION HAS BEEN EFFECTED
WILL ANY
ONE DENY THE OTHER POINT THAT THERE MAY BE SONS OF KINGS OR PRINCES WHO
ARE BY NATURE PHILOSOPHERS
SURELY NO MAN HE SAID
AND WHEN THEY HAVE COME INTO BEING WILL ANY ONE SAY THAT THEY MUST OF
NECESSITY BE DESTROYED THAT THEY CAN HARDLY BE SAVED IS NOT DENIED EVEN
BY US BUT THAT IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF AGES NO SINGLE ONE OF THEM CAN
ESCAPE WHO WILL VENTURE TO AFFIRM THIS
WHO INDEED
BUT SAID I ONE IS ENOUGH LET THERE BE ONE MAN WHO HAS A CITY OBEDIENT
TO HIS WILL AND HE MIGHT BRING INTO EXISTENCE THE IDEAL POLITY ABOUT
WHICH THE WORLD IS SO INCREDULOUS
YES ONE IS ENOUGH
THE RULER MAY IMPOSE THE LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBING AND THE CITIZENS MAY POSSIBLY BE WILLING TO OBEY THEM
CERTAINLY
AND THAT OTHERS SHOULD APPROVE OF WHAT WE APPROVE IS NO MIRACLE OR
IMPOSSIBILITY
I THINK NOT
BUT WE HAVE SUFFICIENTLY SHOWN IN WHAT HAS PRECEDED THAT ALL THIS IF
ONLY POSSIBLE IS ASSUREDLY FOR THE BEST
WE HAVE
AND NOW WE SAY NOT ONLY THAT OUR LAWS IF THEY COULD BE ENACTED WOULD
BE FOR THE BEST BUT ALSO THAT THE ENACTMENT OF THEM THOUGH DIFFICULT
IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE
VERY GOOD
AND SO WITH PAIN AND TOIL WE HAVE REACHED THE END OF ONE SUBJECT BUT
MORE REMAINS TO BE DISCUSSED HOW AND BY WHAT STUDIES AND PURSUITS WILL
THE SAVIOURS OF THE CONSTITUTION BE CREATED AND AT WHAT AGES ARE THEY
TO APPLY THEMSELVES TO THEIR SEVERAL STUDIES
CERTAINLY
I OMITTED THE TROUBLESOME BUSINESS OF THE POSSESSION OF WOMEN AND THE
PROCREATION OF CHILDREN AND THE APPOINTMENT OF THE RULERS BECAUSE
I KNEW THAT THE PERFECT STATE WOULD BE EYED WITH JEALOUSY AND WAS
DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT BUT THAT PIECE OF CLEVERNESS WAS NOT OF MUCH
SERVICE TO ME FOR I HAD TO DISCUSS THEM ALL THE SAME
THE WOMEN AND
CHILDREN ARE NOW DISPOSED OF BUT THE OTHER QUESTION OF THE RULERS MUST
BE INVESTIGATED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING
WE WERE SAYING AS YOU WILL
REMEMBER THAT THEY WERE TO BE LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY TRIED BY THE
TEST OF PLEASURES AND PAINS AND NEITHER IN HARDSHIPS NOR IN DANGERS
NOR AT ANY OTHER CRITICAL MOMENT WERE TO LOSE THEIR PATRIOTISM HE WAS
TO BE REJECTED WHO FAILED BUT HE WHO ALWAYS CAME FORTH PURE LIKE GOLD
TRIED IN THE REFINER'S FIRE WAS TO BE MADE A RULER AND TO RECEIVE
HONOURS AND REWARDS IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH
THIS WAS THE SORT OF THING
WHICH WAS BEING SAID AND THEN THE ARGUMENT TURNED ASIDE AND VEILED HER
FACE NOT LIKING TO STIR THE QUESTION WHICH HAS NOW ARISEN
I PERFECTLY REMEMBER HE SAID
YES MY FRIEND I SAID AND I THEN SHRANK FROM HAZARDING THE BOLD
WORD BUT NOW LET ME DARE TO SAY THAT THE PERFECT GUARDIAN MUST BE A
PHILOSOPHER
YES HE SAID LET THAT BE AFFIRMED
AND DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THERE WILL BE MANY OF THEM FOR THE GIFTS WHICH
WERE DEEMED BY US TO BE ESSENTIAL RARELY GROW TOGETHER THEY ARE MOSTLY
FOUND IN SHREDS AND PATCHES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
YOU ARE AWARE I REPLIED THAT QUICK INTELLIGENCE MEMORY SAGACITY
CLEVERNESS AND SIMILAR QUALITIES DO NOT OFTEN GROW TOGETHER AND THAT
PERSONS WHO POSSESS THEM AND ARE AT THE SAME TIME HIGH SPIRITED AND
MAGNANIMOUS ARE NOT SO CONSTITUTED BY NATURE AS TO LIVE ORDERLY AND IN A
PEACEFUL AND SETTLED MANNER THEY ARE DRIVEN ANY WAY BY THEIR IMPULSES
AND ALL SOLID PRINCIPLE GOES OUT OF THEM
VERY TRUE HE SAID
ON THE OTHER HAND THOSE STEADFAST NATURES WHICH CAN BETTER BE DEPENDED
UPON WHICH IN A BATTLE ARE IMPREGNABLE TO FEAR AND IMMOVABLE ARE
EQUALLY IMMOVABLE WHEN THERE IS ANYTHING TO BE LEARNED THEY ARE
ALWAYS IN A TORPID STATE AND ARE APT TO YAWN AND GO TO SLEEP OVER ANY
INTELLECTUAL TOIL
QUITE TRUE
AND YET WE WERE SAYING THAT BOTH QUALITIES WERE NECESSARY IN THOSE TO
WHOM THE HIGHER EDUCATION IS TO BE IMPARTED AND WHO ARE TO SHARE IN ANY
OFFICE OR COMMAND
CERTAINLY HE SAID
AND WILL THEY BE A CLASS WHICH IS RARELY FOUND
YES INDEED
THEN THE ASPIRANT MUST NOT ONLY BE TESTED IN THOSE LABOURS AND DANGERS
AND PLEASURES WHICH WE MENTIONED BEFORE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER KIND OF
PROBATION WHICH WE DID NOT MENTION HE MUST BE EXERCISED ALSO IN MANY
KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE TO SEE WHETHER THE SOUL WILL BE ABLE TO ENDURE THE
HIGHEST OF ALL OR WILL FAINT UNDER THEM AS IN ANY OTHER STUDIES AND
EXERCISES
YES HE SAID YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT IN TESTING HIM
BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THE HIGHEST OF ALL KNOWLEDGE
YOU MAY REMEMBER I SAID THAT WE DIVIDED THE SOUL INTO THREE PARTS AND
DISTINGUISHED THE SEVERAL NATURES OF JUSTICE TEMPERANCE COURAGE AND
WISDOM
INDEED HE SAID IF I HAD FORGOTTEN I SHOULD NOT DESERVE TO HEAR MORE
AND DO YOU REMEMBER THE WORD OF CAUTION WHICH PRECEDED THE DISCUSSION OF
THEM
TO WHAT DO YOU REFER
WE WERE SAYING IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT HE WHO WANTED TO SEE THEM IN
THEIR PERFECT BEAUTY MUST TAKE A LONGER AND MORE CIRCUITOUS WAY AT
THE END OF WHICH THEY WOULD APPEAR BUT THAT WE COULD ADD ON A POPULAR
EXPOSITION OF THEM ON A LEVEL WITH THE DISCUSSION WHICH HAD PRECEDED
AND YOU REPLIED THAT SUCH AN EXPOSITION WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR YOU AND SO
THE ENQUIRY WAS CONTINUED IN WHAT TO ME SEEMED TO BE A VERY INACCURATE
MANNER WHETHER YOU WERE SATISFIED OR NOT IT IS FOR YOU TO SAY
YES HE SAID I THOUGHT AND THE OTHERS THOUGHT THAT YOU GAVE US A FAIR
MEASURE OF TRUTH
BUT MY FRIEND I SAID A MEASURE OF SUCH THINGS WHICH IN ANY DEGREE
FALLS SHORT OF THE WHOLE TRUTH IS NOT FAIR MEASURE FOR NOTHING
IMPERFECT IS THE MEASURE OF ANYTHING ALTHOUGH PERSONS ARE TOO APT TO BE
CONTENTED AND THINK THAT THEY NEED SEARCH NO FURTHER
NOT AN UNCOMMON CASE WHEN PEOPLE ARE INDOLENT
YES I SAID AND THERE CANNOT BE ANY WORSE FAULT IN A GUARDIAN OF THE
STATE AND OF THE LAWS
TRUE
THE GUARDIAN THEN I SAID MUST BE REQUIRED TO TAKE THE LONGER CIRCUIT
AND TOIL AT LEARNING AS WELL AS AT GYMNASTICS OR HE WILL NEVER REACH
THE HIGHEST KNOWLEDGE OF ALL WHICH AS WE WERE JUST NOW SAYING IS HIS
PROPER CALLING
WHAT HE SAID IS THERE A KNOWLEDGE STILL HIGHER THAN THIS HIGHER THAN
JUSTICE AND THE OTHER VIRTUES
YES I SAID THERE IS
AND OF THE VIRTUES TOO WE MUST BEHOLD NOT THE
OUTLINE MERELY AS AT PRESENT NOTHING SHORT OF THE MOST FINISHED
PICTURE SHOULD SATISFY US
WHEN LITTLE THINGS ARE ELABORATED WITH AN
INFINITY OF PAINS IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY APPEAR IN THEIR FULL BEAUTY
AND UTMOST CLEARNESS HOW RIDICULOUS THAT WE SHOULD NOT THINK THE
HIGHEST TRUTHS WORTHY OF ATTAINING THE HIGHEST ACCURACY
A RIGHT NOBLE THOUGHT BUT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT WE SHALL REFRAIN FROM
ASKING YOU WHAT IS THIS HIGHEST KNOWLEDGE
NAY I SAID ASK IF YOU WILL BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE HEARD THE
ANSWER MANY TIMES AND NOW YOU EITHER DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME OR AS I
RATHER THINK YOU ARE DISPOSED TO BE TROUBLESOME FOR YOU HAVE OFTEN
BEEN TOLD THAT THE IDEA OF GOOD IS THE HIGHEST KNOWLEDGE AND THAT ALL
OTHER THINGS BECOME USEFUL AND ADVANTAGEOUS ONLY BY THEIR USE OF THIS
YOU CAN HARDLY BE IGNORANT THAT OF THIS I WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK CONCERNING
WHICH AS YOU HAVE OFTEN HEARD ME SAY WE KNOW SO LITTLE AND WITHOUT
WHICH ANY OTHER KNOWLEDGE OR POSSESSION OF ANY KIND WILL PROFIT US
NOTHING
DO YOU THINK THAT THE POSSESSION OF ALL OTHER THINGS IS OF
ANY VALUE IF WE DO NOT POSSESS THE GOOD OR THE KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OTHER
THINGS IF WE HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF BEAUTY AND GOODNESS
ASSUREDLY NOT
YOU ARE FURTHER AWARE THAT MOST PEOPLE AFFIRM PLEASURE TO BE THE GOOD
BUT THE FINER SORT OF WITS SAY IT IS KNOWLEDGE
YES
AND YOU ARE AWARE TOO THAT THE LATTER CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT THEY MEAN BY
KNOWLEDGE BUT ARE OBLIGED AFTER ALL TO SAY KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOOD
HOW RIDICULOUS
YES I SAID THAT THEY SHOULD BEGIN BY REPROACHING US WITH OUR IGNORANCE
OF THE GOOD AND THEN PRESUME OUR KNOWLEDGE OF IT FOR THE GOOD THEY
DEFINE TO BE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOOD JUST AS IF WE UNDERSTOOD THEM WHEN
THEY USE THE TERM 'GOOD' THIS IS OF COURSE RIDICULOUS
MOST TRUE HE SAID
AND THOSE WHO MAKE PLEASURE THEIR GOOD ARE IN EQUAL PERPLEXITY FOR THEY
ARE COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT THERE ARE BAD PLEASURES AS WELL AS GOOD
CERTAINLY
AND THEREFORE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BAD AND GOOD ARE THE SAME
TRUE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THE NUMEROUS DIFFICULTIES IN WHICH THIS
QUESTION IS INVOLVED
THERE CAN BE NONE
FURTHER DO WE NOT SEE THAT MANY ARE WILLING TO DO OR TO HAVE OR TO SEEM
TO BE WHAT IS JUST AND HONOURABLE WITHOUT THE REALITY BUT NO ONE IS
SATISFIED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF GOOD THE REALITY IS WHAT THEY SEEK IN
THE CASE OF THE GOOD APPEARANCE IS DESPISED BY EVERY ONE
VERY TRUE HE SAID
OF THIS THEN WHICH EVERY SOUL OF MAN PURSUES AND MAKES THE END OF ALL
HIS ACTIONS HAVING A PRESENTIMENT THAT THERE IS SUCH AN END AND
YET HESITATING BECAUSE NEITHER KNOWING THE NATURE NOR HAVING THE SAME
ASSURANCE OF THIS AS OF OTHER THINGS AND THEREFORE LOSING WHATEVER
GOOD THERE IS IN OTHER THINGS OF A PRINCIPLE SUCH AND SO GREAT AS THIS
OUGHT THE BEST MEN IN OUR STATE TO WHOM EVERYTHING IS ENTRUSTED TO BE
IN THE DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE
CERTAINLY NOT HE SAID
I AM SURE I SAID THAT HE WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW THE BEAUTIFUL AND
THE JUST ARE LIKEWISE GOOD WILL BE BUT A SORRY GUARDIAN OF THEM AND
I SUSPECT THAT NO ONE WHO IS IGNORANT OF THE GOOD WILL HAVE A TRUE
KNOWLEDGE OF THEM
THAT HE SAID IS A SHREWD SUSPICION OF YOURS
AND IF WE ONLY HAVE A GUARDIAN WHO HAS THIS KNOWLEDGE OUR STATE WILL BE
PERFECTLY ORDERED
OF COURSE HE REPLIED BUT I WISH THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME WHETHER YOU
CONCEIVE THIS SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF THE GOOD TO BE KNOWLEDGE OR PLEASURE
OR DIFFERENT FROM EITHER
AYE I SAID I KNEW ALL ALONG THAT A FASTIDIOUS GENTLEMAN LIKE YOU WOULD
NOT BE CONTENTED WITH THE THOUGHTS OF OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THESE MATTERS
TRUE SOCRATES BUT I MUST SAY THAT ONE WHO LIKE YOU HAS PASSED A
LIFETIME IN THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY SHOULD NOT BE ALWAYS REPEATING THE
OPINIONS OF OTHERS AND NEVER TELLING HIS OWN
WELL BUT HAS ANY ONE A RIGHT TO SAY POSITIVELY WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW
NOT HE SAID WITH THE ASSURANCE OF POSITIVE CERTAINTY HE HAS NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT BUT HE MAY SAY WHAT HE THINKS AS A MATTER OF OPINION
AND DO YOU NOT KNOW I SAID THAT ALL MERE OPINIONS ARE BAD AND THE
BEST OF THEM BLIND YOU WOULD NOT DENY THAT THOSE WHO HAVE ANY TRUE
NOTION WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE ARE ONLY LIKE BLIND MEN WHO FEEL THEIR WAY
ALONG THE ROAD
VERY TRUE
AND DO YOU WISH TO BEHOLD WHAT IS BLIND AND CROOKED AND BASE WHEN
OTHERS WILL TELL YOU OF BRIGHTNESS AND BEAUTY
STILL I MUST IMPLORE YOU SOCRATES SAID GLAUCON NOT TO TURN AWAY JUST
AS YOU ARE REACHING THE GOAL IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE SUCH AN EXPLANATION
OF THE GOOD AS YOU HAVE ALREADY GIVEN OF JUSTICE AND TEMPERANCE AND THE
OTHER VIRTUES WE SHALL BE SATISFIED
YES MY FRIEND AND I SHALL BE AT LEAST EQUALLY SATISFIED BUT I CANNOT
HELP FEARING THAT I SHALL FAIL AND THAT MY INDISCREET ZEAL WILL BRING
RIDICULE UPON ME
NO SWEET SIRS LET US NOT AT PRESENT ASK WHAT IS THE
ACTUAL NATURE OF THE GOOD FOR TO REACH WHAT IS NOW IN MY THOUGHTS
WOULD BE AN EFFORT TOO GREAT FOR ME
BUT OF THE CHILD OF THE GOOD WHO
IS LIKEST HIM I WOULD FAIN SPEAK IF I COULD BE SURE THAT YOU WISHED TO
HEAR OTHERWISE NOT
BY ALL MEANS HE SAID TELL US ABOUT THE CHILD AND YOU SHALL REMAIN IN
OUR DEBT FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE PARENT
I DO INDEED WISH I REPLIED THAT I COULD PAY AND YOU RECEIVE THE
ACCOUNT OF THE PARENT AND NOT AS NOW OF THE OFFSPRING ONLY TAKE
HOWEVER THIS LATTER BY WAY OF INTEREST AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A
CARE THAT I DO NOT RENDER A FALSE ACCOUNT ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF DECEIVING YOU
YES WE WILL TAKE ALL THE CARE THAT WE CAN PROCEED
YES I SAID BUT I MUST FIRST COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH YOU AND
REMIND YOU OF WHAT I HAVE MENTIONED IN THE COURSE OF THIS DISCUSSION
AND AT MANY OTHER TIMES
WHAT
THE OLD STORY THAT THERE IS A MANY BEAUTIFUL AND A MANY GOOD AND SO
OF OTHER THINGS WHICH WE DESCRIBE AND DEFINE TO ALL OF THEM THE TERM
'MANY' IS APPLIED
TRUE HE SAID
AND THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AND AN ABSOLUTE GOOD AND OF OTHER
THINGS TO WHICH THE TERM 'MANY' IS APPLIED THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE FOR
THEY MAY BE BROUGHT UNDER A SINGLE IDEA WHICH IS CALLED THE ESSENCE OF
EACH
VERY TRUE
THE MANY AS WE SAY ARE SEEN BUT NOT KNOWN AND THE IDEAS ARE KNOWN BUT
NOT SEEN
EXACTLY
AND WHAT IS THE ORGAN WITH WHICH WE SEE THE VISIBLE THINGS
THE SIGHT HE SAID
AND WITH THE HEARING I SAID WE HEAR AND WITH THE OTHER SENSES
PERCEIVE THE OTHER OBJECTS OF SENSE
TRUE
BUT HAVE YOU REMARKED THAT SIGHT IS BY FAR THE MOST COSTLY AND COMPLEX
PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WHICH THE ARTIFICER OF THE SENSES EVER CONTRIVED
NO I NEVER HAVE HE SAID
THEN REFLECT HAS THE EAR OR VOICE NEED OF ANY THIRD OR ADDITIONAL
NATURE IN ORDER THAT THE ONE MAY BE ABLE TO HEAR AND THE OTHER TO BE
HEARD
NOTHING OF THE SORT
NO INDEED I REPLIED AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF MOST IF NOT ALL THE
OTHER SENSES YOU WOULD NOT SAY THAT ANY OF THEM REQUIRES SUCH AN
ADDITION
CERTAINLY NOT
BUT YOU SEE THAT WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF SOME OTHER NATURE THERE IS NO
SEEING OR BEING SEEN
HOW DO YOU MEAN
SIGHT BEING AS I CONCEIVE IN THE EYES AND HE WHO HAS EYES WANTING TO
SEE COLOUR BEING ALSO PRESENT IN THEM STILL UNLESS THERE BE A THIRD
NATURE SPECIALLY ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSE THE OWNER OF THE EYES WILL SEE
NOTHING AND THE COLOURS WILL BE INVISIBLE
OF WHAT NATURE ARE YOU SPEAKING
OF THAT WHICH YOU TERM LIGHT I REPLIED
TRUE HE SAID
NOBLE THEN IS THE BOND WHICH LINKS TOGETHER SIGHT AND VISIBILITY AND
GREAT BEYOND OTHER BONDS BY NO SMALL DIFFERENCE OF NATURE FOR LIGHT IS
THEIR BOND AND LIGHT IS NO IGNOBLE THING
NAY HE SAID THE REVERSE OF IGNOBLE
AND WHICH I SAID OF THE GODS IN HEAVEN WOULD YOU SAY WAS THE LORD OF
THIS ELEMENT WHOSE IS THAT LIGHT WHICH MAKES THE EYE TO SEE PERFECTLY
AND THE VISIBLE TO APPEAR
YOU MEAN THE SUN AS YOU AND ALL MANKIND SAY
MAY NOT THE RELATION OF SIGHT TO THIS DEITY BE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS
HOW
NEITHER SIGHT NOR THE EYE IN WHICH SIGHT RESIDES IS THE SUN
NO
YET OF ALL THE ORGANS OF SENSE THE EYE IS THE MOST LIKE THE SUN
BY FAR THE MOST LIKE
AND THE POWER WHICH THE EYE POSSESSES IS A SORT OF EFFLUENCE WHICH IS
DISPENSED FROM THE SUN
EXACTLY
THEN THE SUN IS NOT SIGHT BUT THE AUTHOR OF SIGHT WHO IS RECOGNISED BY
SIGHT
TRUE HE SAID
AND THIS IS HE WHOM I CALL THE CHILD OF THE GOOD WHOM THE GOOD BEGAT IN
HIS OWN LIKENESS TO BE IN THE VISIBLE WORLD IN RELATION TO SIGHT
AND THE THINGS OF SIGHT WHAT THE GOOD IS IN THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD IN
RELATION TO MIND AND THE THINGS OF MIND
WILL YOU BE A LITTLE MORE EXPLICIT HE SAID
WHY YOU KNOW I SAID THAT THE EYES WHEN A PERSON DIRECTS THEM TOWARDS
OBJECTS ON WHICH THE LIGHT OF DAY IS NO LONGER SHINING BUT THE MOON
AND STARS ONLY SEE DIMLY AND ARE NEARLY BLIND THEY SEEM TO HAVE NO
CLEARNESS OF VISION IN THEM
VERY TRUE
BUT WHEN THEY ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS OBJECTS ON WHICH THE SUN SHINES THEY
SEE CLEARLY AND THERE IS SIGHT IN THEM
CERTAINLY
AND THE SOUL IS LIKE THE EYE WHEN RESTING UPON THAT ON WHICH TRUTH AND
BEING SHINE THE SOUL PERCEIVES AND UNDERSTANDS AND IS RADIANT WITH
INTELLIGENCE BUT WHEN TURNED TOWARDS THE TWILIGHT OF BECOMING AND
PERISHING THEN SHE HAS OPINION ONLY AND GOES BLINKING ABOUT AND
IS FIRST OF ONE OPINION AND THEN OF ANOTHER AND SEEMS TO HAVE NO
INTELLIGENCE
JUST SO
NOW THAT WHICH IMPARTS TRUTH TO THE KNOWN AND THE POWER OF KNOWING TO
THE KNOWER IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE YOU TERM THE IDEA OF GOOD AND THIS
YOU WILL DEEM TO BE THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE AND OF TRUTH IN SO FAR AS
THE LATTER BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE BEAUTIFUL TOO AS ARE BOTH
TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE YOU WILL BE RIGHT IN ESTEEMING THIS OTHER NATURE AS
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EITHER AND AS IN THE PREVIOUS INSTANCE LIGHT AND
SIGHT MAY BE TRULY SAID TO BE LIKE THE SUN AND YET NOT TO BE THE SUN
SO IN THIS OTHER SPHERE SCIENCE AND TRUTH MAY BE DEEMED TO BE LIKE THE
GOOD BUT NOT THE GOOD THE GOOD HAS A PLACE OF HONOUR YET HIGHER
WHAT A WONDER OF BEAUTY THAT MUST BE HE SAID WHICH IS THE AUTHOR OF
SCIENCE AND TRUTH AND YET SURPASSES THEM IN BEAUTY FOR YOU SURELY
CANNOT MEAN TO SAY THAT PLEASURE IS THE GOOD
GOD FORBID I REPLIED BUT MAY I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE IMAGE IN
ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
IN WHAT POINT OF VIEW
YOU WOULD SAY WOULD YOU NOT THAT THE SUN IS NOT ONLY THE AUTHOR OF
VISIBILITY IN ALL VISIBLE THINGS BUT OF GENERATION AND NOURISHMENT AND
GROWTH THOUGH HE HIMSELF IS NOT GENERATION
CERTAINLY
IN LIKE MANNER THE GOOD MAY BE SAID TO BE NOT ONLY THE AUTHOR OF
KNOWLEDGE TO ALL THINGS KNOWN BUT OF THEIR BEING AND ESSENCE AND YET
THE GOOD IS NOT ESSENCE BUT FAR EXCEEDS ESSENCE IN DIGNITY AND POWER
GLAUCON SAID WITH A LUDICROUS EARNESTNESS BY THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN HOW
AMAZING
YES I SAID AND THE EXAGGERATION MAY BE SET DOWN TO YOU FOR YOU MADE
ME UTTER MY FANCIES
AND PRAY CONTINUE TO UTTER THEM AT ANY RATE LET US HEAR IF THERE IS
ANYTHING MORE TO BE SAID ABOUT THE SIMILITUDE OF THE SUN
YES I SAID THERE IS A GREAT DEAL MORE
THEN OMIT NOTHING HOWEVER SLIGHT
I WILL DO MY BEST I SAID BUT I SHOULD THINK THAT A GREAT DEAL WILL
HAVE TO BE OMITTED
I HOPE NOT HE SAID
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THEN THAT THERE ARE TWO RULING POWERS AND THAT
ONE OF THEM IS SET OVER THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD THE OTHER OVER THE
VISIBLE
I DO NOT SAY HEAVEN LEST YOU SHOULD FANCY THAT I AM PLAYING
UPON THE NAME 'OURHANOZ ORHATOZ'
MAY I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE THIS
DISTINCTION OF THE VISIBLE AND INTELLIGIBLE FIXED IN YOUR MIND
I HAVE
NOW TAKE A LINE WHICH HAS BEEN CUT INTO TWO UNEQUAL PARTS AND DIVIDE
EACH OF THEM AGAIN IN THE SAME PROPORTION AND SUPPOSE THE TWO
MAIN DIVISIONS TO ANSWER ONE TO THE VISIBLE AND THE OTHER TO THE
INTELLIGIBLE AND THEN COMPARE THE SUBDIVISIONS IN RESPECT OF THEIR
CLEARNESS AND WANT OF CLEARNESS AND YOU WILL FIND THAT THE FIRST
SECTION IN THE SPHERE OF THE VISIBLE CONSISTS OF IMAGES
AND BY IMAGES I
MEAN IN THE FIRST PLACE SHADOWS AND IN THE SECOND PLACE REFLECTIONS
IN WATER AND IN SOLID SMOOTH AND POLISHED BODIES AND THE LIKE DO YOU
UNDERSTAND
YES I UNDERSTAND
IMAGINE NOW THE OTHER SECTION OF WHICH THIS IS ONLY THE RESEMBLANCE
TO INCLUDE THE ANIMALS WHICH WE SEE AND EVERYTHING THAT GROWS OR IS
MADE
VERY GOOD
WOULD YOU NOT ADMIT THAT BOTH THE SECTIONS OF THIS DIVISION HAVE
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF TRUTH AND THAT THE COPY IS TO THE ORIGINAL AS THE
SPHERE OF OPINION IS TO THE SPHERE OF KNOWLEDGE
MOST UNDOUBTEDLY
NEXT PROCEED TO CONSIDER THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SPHERE OF THE
INTELLECTUAL IS TO BE DIVIDED
IN WHAT MANNER
THUS THERE ARE TWO SUBDIVISIONS IN THE LOWER OF WHICH THE SOUL USES
THE FIGURES GIVEN BY THE FORMER DIVISION AS IMAGES THE ENQUIRY CAN ONLY
BE HYPOTHETICAL AND INSTEAD OF GOING UPWARDS TO A PRINCIPLE DESCENDS
TO THE OTHER END IN THE HIGHER OF THE TWO THE SOUL PASSES OUT OF
HYPOTHESES AND GOES UP TO A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS ABOVE HYPOTHESES MAKING
NO USE OF IMAGES AS IN THE FORMER CASE BUT PROCEEDING ONLY IN AND
THROUGH THE IDEAS THEMSELVES
I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING HE SAID
THEN I WILL TRY AGAIN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND ME BETTER WHEN I HAVE MADE
SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS
YOU ARE AWARE THAT STUDENTS OF GEOMETRY
ARITHMETIC AND THE KINDRED SCIENCES ASSUME THE ODD AND THE EVEN AND THE
FIGURES AND THREE KINDS OF ANGLES AND THE LIKE IN THEIR SEVERAL BRANCHES
OF SCIENCE THESE ARE THEIR HYPOTHESES WHICH THEY AND EVERY BODY ARE
SUPPOSED TO KNOW AND THEREFORE THEY DO NOT DEIGN TO GIVE ANY ACCOUNT OF
THEM EITHER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS BUT THEY BEGIN WITH THEM AND GO
ON UNTIL THEY ARRIVE AT LAST AND IN A CONSISTENT MANNER AT THEIR
CONCLUSION
YES HE SAID I KNOW
AND DO YOU NOT KNOW ALSO THAT ALTHOUGH THEY MAKE USE OF THE VISIBLE
FORMS AND REASON ABOUT THEM THEY ARE THINKING NOT OF THESE BUT OF THE
IDEALS WHICH THEY RESEMBLE NOT OF THE FIGURES WHICH THEY DRAW BUT
OF THE ABSOLUTE SQUARE AND THE ABSOLUTE DIAMETER AND SO ON THE FORMS
WHICH THEY DRAW OR MAKE AND WHICH HAVE SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS IN WATER
OF THEIR OWN ARE CONVERTED BY THEM INTO IMAGES BUT THEY ARE REALLY
SEEKING TO BEHOLD THE THINGS THEMSELVES WHICH CAN ONLY BE SEEN WITH THE
EYE OF THE MIND
THAT IS TRUE
AND OF THIS KIND I SPOKE AS THE INTELLIGIBLE ALTHOUGH IN THE SEARCH
AFTER IT THE SOUL IS COMPELLED TO USE HYPOTHESES NOT ASCENDING TO
A FIRST PRINCIPLE BECAUSE SHE IS UNABLE TO RISE ABOVE THE REGION OF
HYPOTHESIS BUT EMPLOYING THE OBJECTS OF WHICH THE SHADOWS BELOW ARE
RESEMBLANCES IN THEIR TURN AS IMAGES THEY HAVING IN RELATION TO THE
SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS OF THEM A GREATER DISTINCTNESS AND THEREFORE A
HIGHER VALUE
I UNDERSTAND HE SAID THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING OF THE PROVINCE OF GEOMETRY
AND THE SISTER ARTS
AND WHEN I SPEAK OF THE OTHER DIVISION OF THE INTELLIGIBLE YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND ME TO SPEAK OF THAT OTHER SORT OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH REASON
HERSELF ATTAINS BY THE POWER OF DIALECTIC USING THE HYPOTHESES NOT AS
FIRST PRINCIPLES BUT ONLY AS HYPOTHESES THAT IS TO SAY AS STEPS AND
POINTS OF DEPARTURE INTO A WORLD WHICH IS ABOVE HYPOTHESES IN ORDER
THAT SHE MAY SOAR BEYOND THEM TO THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE AND
CLINGING TO THIS AND THEN TO THAT WHICH DEPENDS ON THIS BY SUCCESSIVE
STEPS SHE DESCENDS AGAIN WITHOUT THE AID OF ANY SENSIBLE OBJECT FROM
IDEAS THROUGH IDEAS AND IN IDEAS SHE ENDS
I UNDERSTAND YOU HE REPLIED NOT PERFECTLY FOR YOU SEEM TO ME TO
BE DESCRIBING A TASK WHICH IS REALLY TREMENDOUS BUT AT ANY RATE I
UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT KNOWLEDGE AND BEING WHICH THE SCIENCE OF
DIALECTIC CONTEMPLATES ARE CLEARER THAN THE NOTIONS OF THE ARTS AS
THEY ARE TERMED WHICH PROCEED FROM HYPOTHESES ONLY THESE ARE ALSO
CONTEMPLATED BY THE UNDERSTANDING AND NOT BY THE SENSES YET BECAUSE
THEY START FROM HYPOTHESES AND DO NOT ASCEND TO A PRINCIPLE THOSE WHO
CONTEMPLATE THEM APPEAR TO YOU NOT TO EXERCISE THE HIGHER REASON
UPON THEM ALTHOUGH WHEN A FIRST PRINCIPLE IS ADDED TO THEM THEY ARE
COGNIZABLE BY THE HIGHER REASON
AND THE HABIT WHICH IS CONCERNED
WITH GEOMETRY AND THE COGNATE SCIENCES I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD TERM
UNDERSTANDING AND NOT REASON AS BEING INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN OPINION AND
REASON
YOU HAVE QUITE CONCEIVED MY MEANING I SAID AND NOW CORRESPONDING TO
THESE FOUR DIVISIONS LET THERE BE FOUR FACULTIES IN THE SOUL REASON
ANSWERING TO THE HIGHEST UNDERSTANDING TO THE SECOND FAITH OR
CONVICTION TO THE THIRD AND PERCEPTION OF SHADOWS TO THE LAST AND LET
THERE BE A SCALE OF THEM AND LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE SEVERAL FACULTIES
HAVE CLEARNESS IN THE SAME DEGREE THAT THEIR OBJECTS HAVE TRUTH
I UNDERSTAND HE REPLIED AND GIVE MY ASSENT AND ACCEPT YOUR
ARRANGEMENT
BOOK VII
AND NOW I SAID LET ME SHOW IN A FIGURE HOW FAR OUR NATURE IS
ENLIGHTENED OR UNENLIGHTENED BEHOLD HUMAN BEINGS LIVING IN A
UNDERGROUND DEN WHICH HAS A MOUTH OPEN TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND REACHING
ALL ALONG THE DEN HERE THEY HAVE BEEN FROM THEIR CHILDHOOD AND HAVE
THEIR LEGS AND NECKS CHAINED SO THAT THEY CANNOT MOVE AND CAN ONLY
SEE BEFORE THEM BEING PREVENTED BY THE CHAINS FROM TURNING ROUND
THEIR HEADS
ABOVE AND BEHIND THEM A FIRE IS BLAZING AT A DISTANCE AND
BETWEEN THE FIRE AND THE PRISONERS THERE IS A RAISED WAY AND YOU WILL
SEE IF YOU LOOK A LOW WALL BUILT ALONG THE WAY LIKE THE SCREEN WHICH
MARIONETTE PLAYERS HAVE IN FRONT OF THEM OVER WHICH THEY SHOW THE
PUPPETS
I SEE
AND DO YOU SEE I SAID MEN PASSING ALONG THE WALL CARRYING ALL SORTS OF
VESSELS AND STATUES AND FIGURES OF ANIMALS MADE OF WOOD AND STONE AND
VARIOUS MATERIALS WHICH APPEAR OVER THE WALL SOME OF THEM ARE TALKING
OTHERS SILENT
YOU HAVE SHOWN ME A STRANGE IMAGE AND THEY ARE STRANGE PRISONERS
LIKE OURSELVES I REPLIED AND THEY SEE ONLY THEIR OWN SHADOWS OR THE
SHADOWS OF ONE ANOTHER WHICH THE FIRE THROWS ON THE OPPOSITE WALL OF
THE CAVE
TRUE HE SAID HOW COULD THEY SEE ANYTHING BUT THE SHADOWS IF THEY WERE
NEVER ALLOWED TO MOVE THEIR HEADS
AND OF THE OBJECTS WHICH ARE BEING CARRIED IN LIKE MANNER THEY WOULD
ONLY SEE THE SHADOWS
YES HE SAID
AND IF THEY WERE ABLE TO CONVERSE WITH ONE ANOTHER WOULD THEY NOT
SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE NAMING WHAT WAS ACTUALLY BEFORE THEM
VERY TRUE
AND SUPPOSE FURTHER THAT THE PRISON HAD AN ECHO WHICH CAME FROM THE
OTHER SIDE WOULD THEY NOT BE SURE TO FANCY WHEN ONE OF THE PASSERS BY
SPOKE THAT THE VOICE WHICH THEY HEARD CAME FROM THE PASSING SHADOW
NO QUESTION HE REPLIED
TO THEM I SAID THE TRUTH WOULD BE LITERALLY NOTHING BUT THE SHADOWS OF
THE IMAGES
THAT IS CERTAIN
AND NOW LOOK AGAIN AND SEE WHAT WILL NATURALLY FOLLOW IF THE PRISONERS
ARE RELEASED AND DISABUSED OF THEIR ERROR
AT FIRST WHEN ANY OF THEM IS
LIBERATED AND COMPELLED SUDDENLY TO STAND UP AND TURN HIS NECK ROUND AND
WALK AND LOOK TOWARDS THE LIGHT HE WILL SUFFER SHARP PAINS THE GLARE
WILL DISTRESS HIM AND HE WILL BE UNABLE TO SEE THE REALITIES OF WHICH
IN HIS FORMER STATE HE HAD SEEN THE SHADOWS AND THEN CONCEIVE SOME ONE
SAYING TO HIM THAT WHAT HE SAW BEFORE WAS AN ILLUSION BUT THAT NOW
WHEN HE IS APPROACHING NEARER TO BEING AND HIS EYE IS TURNED TOWARDS
MORE REAL EXISTENCE HE HAS A CLEARER VISION WHAT WILL BE HIS REPLY
AND YOU MAY FURTHER IMAGINE THAT HIS INSTRUCTOR IS POINTING TO THE
OBJECTS AS THEY PASS AND REQUIRING HIM TO NAME THEM WILL HE NOT BE
PERPLEXED WILL HE NOT FANCY THAT THE SHADOWS WHICH HE FORMERLY SAW ARE
TRUER THAN THE OBJECTS WHICH ARE NOW SHOWN TO HIM
FAR TRUER
AND IF HE IS COMPELLED TO LOOK STRAIGHT AT THE LIGHT WILL HE NOT HAVE
A PAIN IN HIS EYES WHICH WILL MAKE HIM TURN AWAY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE
OBJECTS OF VISION WHICH HE CAN SEE AND WHICH HE WILL CONCEIVE TO BE IN
REALITY CLEARER THAN THE THINGS WHICH ARE NOW BEING SHOWN TO HIM
TRUE HE SAID
AND SUPPOSE ONCE MORE THAT HE IS RELUCTANTLY DRAGGED UP A STEEP AND
RUGGED ASCENT AND HELD FAST UNTIL HE IS FORCED INTO THE PRESENCE OF
THE SUN HIMSELF IS HE NOT LIKELY TO BE PAINED AND IRRITATED WHEN HE
APPROACHES THE LIGHT HIS EYES WILL BE DAZZLED AND HE WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO SEE ANYTHING AT ALL OF WHAT ARE NOW CALLED REALITIES
NOT ALL IN A MOMENT HE SAID
HE WILL REQUIRE TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THE SIGHT OF THE UPPER WORLD
AND FIRST HE WILL SEE THE SHADOWS BEST NEXT THE REFLECTIONS OF MEN AND
OTHER OBJECTS IN THE WATER AND THEN THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES THEN HE
WILL GAZE UPON THE LIGHT OF THE MOON AND THE STARS AND THE SPANGLED
HEAVEN AND HE WILL SEE THE SKY AND THE STARS BY NIGHT BETTER THAN THE
SUN OR THE LIGHT OF THE SUN BY DAY
CERTAINLY
LAST OF ALL HE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE SUN AND NOT MERE REFLECTIONS OF
HIM IN THE WATER BUT HE WILL SEE HIM IN HIS OWN PROPER PLACE AND NOT
IN ANOTHER AND HE WILL CONTEMPLATE HIM AS HE IS
CERTAINLY
HE WILL THEN PROCEED TO ARGUE THAT THIS IS HE WHO GIVES THE SEASON AND
THE YEARS AND IS THE GUARDIAN OF ALL THAT IS IN THE VISIBLE WORLD AND
IN A CERTAIN WAY THE CAUSE OF ALL THINGS WHICH HE AND HIS FELLOWS HAVE
BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD
CLEARLY HE SAID HE WOULD FIRST SEE THE SUN AND THEN REASON ABOUT HIM
AND WHEN HE REMEMBERED HIS OLD HABITATION AND THE WISDOM OF THE DEN
AND HIS FELLOW PRISONERS DO YOU NOT SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD FELICITATE
HIMSELF ON THE CHANGE AND PITY THEM
CERTAINLY HE WOULD
AND IF THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CONFERRING HONOURS AMONG THEMSELVES
ON THOSE WHO WERE QUICKEST TO OBSERVE THE PASSING SHADOWS AND TO REMARK
WHICH OF THEM WENT BEFORE AND WHICH FOLLOWED AFTER AND WHICH WERE
TOGETHER AND WHO WERE THEREFORE BEST ABLE TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE
FUTURE DO YOU THINK THAT HE WOULD CARE FOR SUCH HONOURS AND GLORIES OR
ENVY THE POSSESSORS OF THEM WOULD HE NOT SAY WITH HOMER
'BETTER TO BE THE POOR SERVANT OF A POOR MASTER
AND TO ENDURE ANYTHING RATHER THAN THINK AS THEY DO AND LIVE AFTER
THEIR MANNER
YES HE SAID I THINK THAT HE WOULD RATHER SUFFER ANYTHING THAN
ENTERTAIN THESE FALSE NOTIONS AND LIVE IN THIS MISERABLE MANNER
IMAGINE ONCE MORE I SAID SUCH AN ONE COMING SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SUN
TO BE REPLACED IN HIS OLD SITUATION WOULD HE NOT BE CERTAIN TO HAVE HIS
EYES FULL OF DARKNESS
TO BE SURE HE SAID
AND IF THERE WERE A CONTEST AND HE HAD TO COMPETE IN MEASURING THE
SHADOWS WITH THE PRISONERS WHO HAD NEVER MOVED OUT OF THE DEN WHILE
HIS SIGHT WAS STILL WEAK AND BEFORE HIS EYES HAD BECOME STEADY AND THE
TIME WHICH WOULD BE NEEDED TO ACQUIRE THIS NEW HABIT OF SIGHT MIGHT BE
VERY CONSIDERABLE WOULD HE NOT BE RIDICULOUS MEN WOULD SAY OF HIM
THAT UP HE WENT AND DOWN HE CAME WITHOUT HIS EYES AND THAT IT WAS
BETTER NOT EVEN TO THINK OF ASCENDING AND IF ANY ONE TRIED TO LOOSE
ANOTHER AND LEAD HIM UP TO THE LIGHT LET THEM ONLY CATCH THE OFFENDER
AND THEY WOULD PUT HIM TO DEATH
NO QUESTION HE SAID
THIS ENTIRE ALLEGORY I SAID YOU MAY NOW APPEND DEAR GLAUCON TO THE
PREVIOUS ARGUMENT THE PRISON HOUSE IS THE WORLD OF SIGHT THE LIGHT OF
THE FIRE IS THE SUN AND YOU WILL NOT MISAPPREHEND ME IF YOU INTERPRET
THE JOURNEY UPWARDS TO BE THE ASCENT OF THE SOUL INTO THE INTELLECTUAL
WORLD ACCORDING TO MY POOR BELIEF WHICH AT YOUR DESIRE I HAVE
EXPRESSED WHETHER RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY GOD KNOWS
BUT WHETHER TRUE OR
FALSE MY OPINION IS THAT IN THE WORLD OF KNOWLEDGE THE IDEA OF GOOD
APPEARS LAST OF ALL AND IS SEEN ONLY WITH AN EFFORT AND WHEN SEEN
IS ALSO INFERRED TO BE THE UNIVERSAL AUTHOR OF ALL THINGS BEAUTIFUL AND
RIGHT PARENT OF LIGHT AND OF THE LORD OF LIGHT IN THIS VISIBLE WORLD
AND THE IMMEDIATE SOURCE OF REASON AND TRUTH IN THE INTELLECTUAL AND
THAT THIS IS THE POWER UPON WHICH HE WHO WOULD ACT RATIONALLY EITHER IN
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE LIFE MUST HAVE HIS EYE FIXED
I AGREE HE SAID AS FAR AS I AM ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU
MOREOVER I SAID YOU MUST NOT WONDER THAT THOSE WHO ATTAIN TO THIS
BEATIFIC VISION ARE UNWILLING TO DESCEND TO HUMAN AFFAIRS FOR THEIR
SOULS ARE EVER HASTENING INTO THE UPPER WORLD WHERE THEY DESIRE TO
DWELL WHICH DESIRE OF THEIRS IS VERY NATURAL IF OUR ALLEGORY MAY BE
TRUSTED
YES VERY NATURAL
AND IS THERE ANYTHING SURPRISING IN ONE WHO PASSES FROM DIVINE
CONTEMPLATIONS TO THE EVIL STATE OF MAN MISBEHAVING HIMSELF IN A
RIDICULOUS MANNER IF WHILE HIS EYES ARE BLINKING AND BEFORE HE HAS
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE SURROUNDING DARKNESS HE IS COMPELLED TO FIGHT
IN COURTS OF LAW OR IN OTHER PLACES ABOUT THE IMAGES OR THE SHADOWS OF
IMAGES OF JUSTICE AND IS ENDEAVOURING TO MEET THE CONCEPTIONS OF THOSE
WHO HAVE NEVER YET SEEN ABSOLUTE JUSTICE
ANYTHING BUT SURPRISING HE REPLIED
ANY ONE WHO HAS COMMON SENSE WILL REMEMBER THAT THE BEWILDERMENTS OF THE
EYES ARE OF TWO KINDS AND ARISE FROM TWO CAUSES EITHER FROM COMING OUT
OF THE LIGHT OR FROM GOING INTO THE LIGHT WHICH IS TRUE OF THE MIND'S
EYE QUITE AS MUCH AS OF THE BODILY EYE AND HE WHO REMEMBERS THIS WHEN
HE SEES ANY ONE WHOSE VISION IS PERPLEXED AND WEAK WILL NOT BE TOO
READY TO LAUGH HE WILL FIRST ASK WHETHER THAT SOUL OF MAN HAS COME OUT
OF THE BRIGHTER LIFE AND IS UNABLE TO SEE BECAUSE UNACCUSTOMED TO THE
DARK OR HAVING TURNED FROM DARKNESS TO THE DAY IS DAZZLED BY EXCESS
OF LIGHT
AND HE WILL COUNT THE ONE HAPPY IN HIS CONDITION AND STATE OF
BEING AND HE WILL PITY THE OTHER OR IF HE HAVE A MIND TO LAUGH AT THE
SOUL WHICH COMES FROM BELOW INTO THE LIGHT THERE WILL BE MORE REASON
IN THIS THAN IN THE LAUGH WHICH GREETS HIM WHO RETURNS FROM ABOVE OUT OF
THE LIGHT INTO THE DEN
THAT HE SAID IS A VERY JUST DISTINCTION
BUT THEN IF I AM RIGHT CERTAIN PROFESSORS OF EDUCATION MUST BE WRONG
WHEN THEY SAY THAT THEY CAN PUT A KNOWLEDGE INTO THE SOUL WHICH WAS NOT
THERE BEFORE LIKE SIGHT INTO BLIND EYES
THEY UNDOUBTEDLY SAY THIS HE REPLIED
WHEREAS OUR ARGUMENT SHOWS THAT THE POWER AND CAPACITY OF LEARNING
EXISTS IN THE SOUL ALREADY AND THAT JUST AS THE EYE WAS UNABLE TO TURN
FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT WITHOUT THE WHOLE BODY SO TOO THE INSTRUMENT OF
KNOWLEDGE CAN ONLY BY THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHOLE SOUL BE TURNED FROM THE
WORLD OF BECOMING INTO THAT OF BEING AND LEARN BY DEGREES TO ENDURE
THE SIGHT OF BEING AND OF THE BRIGHTEST AND BEST OF BEING OR IN OTHER
WORDS OF THE GOOD
VERY TRUE
AND MUST THERE NOT BE SOME ART WHICH WILL EFFECT CONVERSION IN THE
EASIEST AND QUICKEST MANNER NOT IMPLANTING THE FACULTY OF SIGHT FOR
THAT EXISTS ALREADY BUT HAS BEEN TURNED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND IS
LOOKING AWAY FROM THE TRUTH
YES HE SAID SUCH AN ART MAY BE PRESUMED
AND WHEREAS THE OTHER SO CALLED VIRTUES OF THE SOUL SEEM TO BE AKIN TO
BODILY QUALITIES FOR EVEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT ORIGINALLY INNATE THEY CAN
BE IMPLANTED LATER BY HABIT AND EXERCISE THE VIRTUE OF WISDOM MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE CONTAINS A DIVINE ELEMENT WHICH ALWAYS REMAINS AND BY
THIS CONVERSION IS RENDERED USEFUL AND PROFITABLE OR ON THE OTHER
HAND HURTFUL AND USELESS
DID YOU NEVER OBSERVE THE NARROW INTELLIGENCE
FLASHING FROM THE KEEN EYE OF A CLEVER ROGUE HOW EAGER HE IS HOW
CLEARLY HIS PALTRY SOUL SEES THE WAY TO HIS END HE IS THE REVERSE OF
BLIND BUT HIS KEEN EYE SIGHT IS FORCED INTO THE SERVICE OF EVIL AND HE
IS MISCHIEVOUS IN PROPORTION TO HIS CLEVERNESS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
BUT WHAT IF THERE HAD BEEN A CIRCUMCISION OF SUCH NATURES IN THE DAYS
OF THEIR YOUTH AND THEY HAD BEEN SEVERED FROM THOSE SENSUAL PLEASURES
SUCH AS EATING AND DRINKING WHICH LIKE LEADEN WEIGHTS WERE ATTACHED
TO THEM AT THEIR BIRTH AND WHICH DRAG THEM DOWN AND TURN THE VISION
OF THEIR SOULS UPON THE THINGS THAT ARE BELOW IF I SAY THEY HAD BEEN
RELEASED FROM THESE IMPEDIMENTS AND TURNED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
THE VERY SAME FACULTY IN THEM WOULD HAVE SEEN THE TRUTH AS KEENLY AS
THEY SEE WHAT THEIR EYES ARE TURNED TO NOW
VERY LIKELY
YES I SAID AND THERE IS ANOTHER THING WHICH IS LIKELY OR RATHER A
NECESSARY INFERENCE FROM WHAT HAS PRECEDED THAT NEITHER THE UNEDUCATED
AND UNINFORMED OF THE TRUTH NOR YET THOSE WHO NEVER MAKE AN END OF
THEIR EDUCATION WILL BE ABLE MINISTERS OF STATE NOT THE FORMER
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO SINGLE AIM OF DUTY WHICH IS THE RULE OF ALL THEIR
ACTIONS PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC NOR THE LATTER BECAUSE THEY WILL
NOT ACT AT ALL EXCEPT UPON COMPULSION FANCYING THAT THEY ARE ALREADY
DWELLING APART IN THE ISLANDS OF THE BLEST
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
THEN I SAID THE BUSINESS OF US WHO ARE THE FOUNDERS OF THE STATE
WILL BE TO COMPEL THE BEST MINDS TO ATTAIN THAT KNOWLEDGE WHICH WE HAVE
ALREADY SHOWN TO BE THE GREATEST OF ALL THEY MUST CONTINUE TO ASCEND
UNTIL THEY ARRIVE AT THE GOOD BUT WHEN THEY HAVE ASCENDED AND SEEN
ENOUGH WE MUST NOT ALLOW THEM TO DO AS THEY DO NOW
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN THAT THEY REMAIN IN THE UPPER WORLD BUT THIS MUST NOT BE
ALLOWED THEY MUST BE MADE TO DESCEND AGAIN AMONG THE PRISONERS IN THE
DEN AND PARTAKE OF THEIR LABOURS AND HONOURS WHETHER THEY ARE WORTH
HAVING OR NOT
BUT IS NOT THIS UNJUST HE SAID OUGHT WE TO GIVE THEM A WORSE LIFE
WHEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER
YOU HAVE AGAIN FORGOTTEN MY FRIEND I SAID THE INTENTION OF THE
LEGISLATOR WHO DID NOT AIM AT MAKING ANY ONE CLASS IN THE STATE HAPPY
ABOVE THE REST THE HAPPINESS WAS TO BE IN THE WHOLE STATE AND HE
HELD THE CITIZENS TOGETHER BY PERSUASION AND NECESSITY MAKING THEM
BENEFACTORS OF THE STATE AND THEREFORE BENEFACTORS OF ONE ANOTHER
TO THIS END HE CREATED THEM NOT TO PLEASE THEMSELVES BUT TO BE HIS
INSTRUMENTS IN BINDING UP THE STATE
TRUE HE SAID I HAD FORGOTTEN
OBSERVE GLAUCON THAT THERE WILL BE NO INJUSTICE IN COMPELLING OUR
PHILOSOPHERS TO HAVE A CARE AND PROVIDENCE OF OTHERS WE SHALL EXPLAIN
TO THEM THAT IN OTHER STATES MEN OF THEIR CLASS ARE NOT OBLIGED TO
SHARE IN THE TOILS OF POLITICS AND THIS IS REASONABLE FOR THEY GROW UP
AT THEIR OWN SWEET WILL AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE THEM
BEING SELF TAUGHT THEY CANNOT BE EXPECTED TO SHOW ANY GRATITUDE FOR A
CULTURE WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER RECEIVED
BUT WE HAVE BROUGHT YOU INTO
THE WORLD TO BE RULERS OF THE HIVE KINGS OF YOURSELVES AND OF THE OTHER
CITIZENS AND HAVE EDUCATED YOU FAR BETTER AND MORE PERFECTLY THAN THEY
HAVE BEEN EDUCATED AND YOU ARE BETTER ABLE TO SHARE IN THE DOUBLE DUTY
WHEREFORE EACH OF YOU WHEN HIS TURN COMES MUST GO DOWN TO THE GENERAL
UNDERGROUND ABODE AND GET THE HABIT OF SEEING IN THE DARK
WHEN YOU
HAVE ACQUIRED THE HABIT YOU WILL SEE TEN THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN THE
INHABITANTS OF THE DEN AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT THE SEVERAL IMAGES ARE
AND WHAT THEY REPRESENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL AND JUST
AND GOOD IN THEIR TRUTH
AND THUS OUR STATE WHICH IS ALSO YOURS WILL
BE A REALITY AND NOT A DREAM ONLY AND WILL BE ADMINISTERED IN A SPIRIT
UNLIKE THAT OF OTHER STATES IN WHICH MEN FIGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER ABOUT
SHADOWS ONLY AND ARE DISTRACTED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER WHICH IN
THEIR EYES IS A GREAT GOOD
WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS THAT THE STATE IN WHICH
THE RULERS ARE MOST RELUCTANT TO GOVERN IS ALWAYS THE BEST AND MOST
QUIETLY GOVERNED AND THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE MOST EAGER THE WORST
QUITE TRUE HE REPLIED
AND WILL OUR PUPILS WHEN THEY HEAR THIS REFUSE TO TAKE THEIR TURN AT
THE TOILS OF STATE WHEN THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SPEND THE GREATER PART OF
THEIR TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE HEAVENLY LIGHT
IMPOSSIBLE HE ANSWERED FOR THEY ARE JUST MEN AND THE COMMANDS WHICH
WE IMPOSE UPON THEM ARE JUST THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT EVERY ONE OF
THEM WILL TAKE OFFICE AS A STERN NECESSITY AND NOT AFTER THE FASHION OF
OUR PRESENT RULERS OF STATE
YES MY FRIEND I SAID AND THERE LIES THE POINT
YOU MUST CONTRIVE FOR
YOUR FUTURE RULERS ANOTHER AND A BETTER LIFE THAN THAT OF A RULER AND
THEN YOU MAY HAVE A WELL ORDERED STATE FOR ONLY IN THE STATE WHICH
OFFERS THIS WILL THEY RULE WHO ARE TRULY RICH NOT IN SILVER AND GOLD
BUT IN VIRTUE AND WISDOM WHICH ARE THE TRUE BLESSINGS OF LIFE
WHEREAS
IF THEY GO TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS POOR AND HUNGERING
AFTER THEIR OWN PRIVATE ADVANTAGE THINKING THAT HENCE THEY ARE TO
SNATCH THE CHIEF GOOD ORDER THERE CAN NEVER BE FOR THEY WILL BE
FIGHTING ABOUT OFFICE AND THE CIVIL AND DOMESTIC BROILS WHICH THUS
ARISE WILL BE THE RUIN OF THE RULERS THEMSELVES AND OF THE WHOLE STATE
MOST TRUE HE REPLIED
AND THE ONLY LIFE WHICH LOOKS DOWN UPON THE LIFE OF POLITICAL AMBITION
IS THAT OF TRUE PHILOSOPHY
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY OTHER
INDEED I DO NOT HE SAID
AND THOSE WHO GOVERN OUGHT NOT TO BE LOVERS OF THE TASK FOR IF THEY
ARE THERE WILL BE RIVAL LOVERS AND THEY WILL FIGHT
NO QUESTION
WHO THEN ARE THOSE WHOM WE SHALL COMPEL TO BE GUARDIANS SURELY THEY
WILL BE THE MEN WHO ARE WISEST ABOUT AFFAIRS OF STATE AND BY WHOM THE
STATE IS BEST ADMINISTERED AND WHO AT THE SAME TIME HAVE OTHER HONOURS
AND ANOTHER AND A BETTER LIFE THAN THAT OF POLITICS
THEY ARE THE MEN AND I WILL CHOOSE THEM HE REPLIED
AND NOW SHALL WE CONSIDER IN WHAT WAY SUCH GUARDIANS WILL BE PRODUCED
AND HOW THEY ARE TO BE BROUGHT FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT AS SOME ARE SAID
TO HAVE ASCENDED FROM THE WORLD BELOW TO THE GODS
BY ALL MEANS HE REPLIED
THE PROCESS I SAID IS NOT THE TURNING OVER OF AN OYSTER SHELL IN
ALLUSION TO A GAME IN WHICH TWO PARTIES FLED OR PURSUED ACCORDING AS AN
OYSTER SHELL WHICH WAS THROWN INTO THE AIR FELL WITH THE DARK OR LIGHT
SIDE UPPERMOST BUT THE TURNING ROUND OF A SOUL PASSING FROM A DAY
WHICH IS LITTLE BETTER THAN NIGHT TO THE TRUE DAY OF BEING THAT IS THE
ASCENT FROM BELOW WHICH WE AFFIRM TO BE TRUE PHILOSOPHY
QUITE SO
AND SHOULD WE NOT ENQUIRE WHAT SORT OF KNOWLEDGE HAS THE POWER OF
EFFECTING SUCH A CHANGE
CERTAINLY
WHAT SORT OF KNOWLEDGE IS THERE WHICH WOULD DRAW THE SOUL FROM BECOMING
TO BEING AND ANOTHER CONSIDERATION HAS JUST OCCURRED TO ME YOU WILL
REMEMBER THAT OUR YOUNG MEN ARE TO BE WARRIOR ATHLETES
YES THAT WAS SAID
THEN THIS NEW KIND OF KNOWLEDGE MUST HAVE AN ADDITIONAL QUALITY
WHAT QUALITY
USEFULNESS IN WAR
YES IF POSSIBLE
THERE WERE TWO PARTS IN OUR FORMER SCHEME OF EDUCATION WERE THERE NOT
JUST SO
THERE WAS GYMNASTIC WHICH PRESIDED OVER THE GROWTH AND DECAY OF THE
BODY AND MAY THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS HAVING TO DO WITH GENERATION AND
CORRUPTION
TRUE
THEN THAT IS NOT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH WE ARE SEEKING TO DISCOVER
NO
BUT WHAT DO YOU SAY OF MUSIC WHICH ALSO ENTERED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
INTO OUR FORMER SCHEME
MUSIC HE SAID AS YOU WILL REMEMBER WAS THE COUNTERPART OF GYMNASTIC
AND TRAINED THE GUARDIANS BY THE INFLUENCES OF HABIT BY HARMONY MAKING
THEM HARMONIOUS BY RHYTHM RHYTHMICAL BUT NOT GIVING THEM SCIENCE AND
THE WORDS WHETHER FABULOUS OR POSSIBLY TRUE HAD KINDRED ELEMENTS OF
RHYTHM AND HARMONY IN THEM
BUT IN MUSIC THERE WAS NOTHING WHICH TENDED
TO THAT GOOD WHICH YOU ARE NOW SEEKING
YOU ARE MOST ACCURATE I SAID IN YOUR RECOLLECTION IN MUSIC THERE
CERTAINLY WAS NOTHING OF THE KIND
BUT WHAT BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE IS
THERE MY DEAR GLAUCON WHICH IS OF THE DESIRED NATURE SINCE ALL THE
USEFUL ARTS WERE RECKONED MEAN BY US
UNDOUBTEDLY AND YET IF MUSIC AND GYMNASTIC ARE EXCLUDED AND THE ARTS
ARE ALSO EXCLUDED WHAT REMAINS
WELL I SAID THERE MAY BE NOTHING LEFT OF OUR SPECIAL SUBJECTS AND
THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT SPECIAL BUT OF
UNIVERSAL APPLICATION
WHAT MAY THAT BE
A SOMETHING WHICH ALL ARTS AND SCIENCES AND INTELLIGENCES USE IN COMMON
AND WHICH EVERY ONE FIRST HAS TO LEARN AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION
WHAT IS THAT
THE LITTLE MATTER OF DISTINGUISHING ONE TWO AND THREE IN A WORD
NUMBER AND CALCULATION DO NOT ALL ARTS AND SCIENCES NECESSARILY
PARTAKE OF THEM
YES
THEN THE ART OF WAR PARTAKES OF THEM
TO BE SURE
THEN PALAMEDES WHENEVER HE APPEARS IN TRAGEDY PROVES AGAMEMNON
RIDICULOUSLY UNFIT TO BE A GENERAL
DID YOU NEVER REMARK HOW HE DECLARES
THAT HE HAD INVENTED NUMBER AND HAD NUMBERED THE SHIPS AND SET IN ARRAY
THE RANKS OF THE ARMY AT TROY WHICH IMPLIES THAT THEY HAD NEVER BEEN
NUMBERED BEFORE AND AGAMEMNON MUST BE SUPPOSED LITERALLY TO HAVE BEEN
INCAPABLE OF COUNTING HIS OWN FEET HOW COULD HE IF HE WAS IGNORANT OF
NUMBER AND IF THAT IS TRUE WHAT SORT OF GENERAL MUST HE HAVE BEEN
I SHOULD SAY A VERY STRANGE ONE IF THIS WAS AS YOU SAY
CAN WE DENY THAT A WARRIOR SHOULD HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF ARITHMETIC
CERTAINLY HE SHOULD IF HE IS TO HAVE THE SMALLEST UNDERSTANDING OF
MILITARY TACTICS OR INDEED I SHOULD RATHER SAY IF HE IS TO BE A MAN
AT ALL
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE THE SAME NOTION WHICH I HAVE OF
THIS STUDY
WHAT IS YOUR NOTION
IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE A STUDY OF THE KIND WHICH WE ARE SEEKING AND
WHICH LEADS NATURALLY TO REFLECTION BUT NEVER TO HAVE BEEN RIGHTLY
USED FOR THE TRUE USE OF IT IS SIMPLY TO DRAW THE SOUL TOWARDS BEING
WILL YOU EXPLAIN YOUR MEANING HE SAID
I WILL TRY I SAID AND I WISH YOU WOULD SHARE THE ENQUIRY WITH ME
AND SAY 'YES' OR 'NO' WHEN I ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH IN MY OWN MIND WHAT
BRANCHES OF KNOWLEDGE HAVE THIS ATTRACTING POWER IN ORDER THAT WE MAY
HAVE CLEARER PROOF THAT ARITHMETIC IS AS I SUSPECT ONE OF THEM
EXPLAIN HE SAID
I MEAN TO SAY THAT OBJECTS OF SENSE ARE OF TWO KINDS SOME OF THEM DO
NOT INVITE THOUGHT BECAUSE THE SENSE IS AN ADEQUATE JUDGE OF THEM WHILE
IN THE CASE OF OTHER OBJECTS SENSE IS SO UNTRUSTWORTHY THAT FURTHER
ENQUIRY IS IMPERATIVELY DEMANDED
YOU ARE CLEARLY REFERRING HE SAID TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SENSES
ARE IMPOSED UPON BY DISTANCE AND BY PAINTING IN LIGHT AND SHADE
NO I SAID THAT IS NOT AT ALL MY MEANING
THEN WHAT IS YOUR MEANING
WHEN SPEAKING OF UNINVITING OBJECTS I MEAN THOSE WHICH DO NOT PASS FROM
ONE SENSATION TO THE OPPOSITE INVITING OBJECTS ARE THOSE WHICH DO IN
THIS LATTER CASE THE SENSE COMING UPON THE OBJECT WHETHER AT A DISTANCE
OR NEAR GIVES NO MORE VIVID IDEA OF ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR THAN OF ITS
OPPOSITE
AN ILLUSTRATION WILL MAKE MY MEANING CLEARER HERE ARE THREE
FINGERS A LITTLE FINGER A SECOND FINGER AND A MIDDLE FINGER
VERY GOOD
YOU MAY SUPPOSE THAT THEY ARE SEEN QUITE CLOSE AND HERE COMES THE
POINT
WHAT IS IT
EACH OF THEM EQUALLY APPEARS A FINGER WHETHER SEEN IN THE MIDDLE OR
AT THE EXTREMITY WHETHER WHITE OR BLACK OR THICK OR THIN IT MAKES NO
DIFFERENCE A FINGER IS A FINGER ALL THE SAME
IN THESE CASES A MAN IS
NOT COMPELLED TO ASK OF THOUGHT THE QUESTION WHAT IS A FINGER FOR THE
SIGHT NEVER INTIMATES TO THE MIND THAT A FINGER IS OTHER THAN A FINGER
TRUE
AND THEREFORE I SAID AS WE MIGHT EXPECT THERE IS NOTHING HERE WHICH
INVITES OR EXCITES INTELLIGENCE
THERE IS NOT HE SAID
BUT IS THIS EQUALLY TRUE OF THE GREATNESS AND SMALLNESS OF THE FINGERS
CAN SIGHT ADEQUATELY PERCEIVE THEM AND IS NO DIFFERENCE MADE BY THE
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ONE OF THE FINGERS IS IN THE MIDDLE AND ANOTHER AT
THE EXTREMITY AND IN LIKE MANNER DOES THE TOUCH ADEQUATELY PERCEIVE THE
QUALITIES OF THICKNESS OR THINNESS OF SOFTNESS OR HARDNESS AND SO OF
THE OTHER SENSES DO THEY GIVE PERFECT INTIMATIONS OF SUCH MATTERS IS
NOT THEIR MODE OF OPERATION ON THIS WISE THE SENSE WHICH IS CONCERNED
WITH THE QUALITY OF HARDNESS IS NECESSARILY CONCERNED ALSO WITH THE
QUALITY OF SOFTNESS AND ONLY INTIMATES TO THE SOUL THAT THE SAME THING
IS FELT TO BE BOTH HARD AND SOFT
YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT HE SAID
AND MUST NOT THE SOUL BE PERPLEXED AT THIS INTIMATION WHICH THE SENSE
GIVES OF A HARD WHICH IS ALSO SOFT WHAT AGAIN IS THE MEANING OF
LIGHT AND HEAVY IF THAT WHICH IS LIGHT IS ALSO HEAVY AND THAT WHICH IS
HEAVY LIGHT
YES HE SAID THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH THE SOUL RECEIVES ARE VERY CURIOUS
AND REQUIRE TO BE EXPLAINED
YES I SAID AND IN THESE PERPLEXITIES THE SOUL NATURALLY SUMMONS TO HER
AID CALCULATION AND INTELLIGENCE THAT SHE MAY SEE WHETHER THE SEVERAL
OBJECTS ANNOUNCED TO HER ARE ONE OR TWO
TRUE
AND IF THEY TURN OUT TO BE TWO IS NOT EACH OF THEM ONE AND DIFFERENT
CERTAINLY
AND IF EACH IS ONE AND BOTH ARE TWO SHE WILL CONCEIVE THE TWO AS IN
A STATE OF DIVISION FOR IF THERE WERE UNDIVIDED THEY COULD ONLY BE
CONCEIVED OF AS ONE
TRUE
THE EYE CERTAINLY DID SEE BOTH SMALL AND GREAT BUT ONLY IN A CONFUSED
MANNER THEY WERE NOT DISTINGUISHED
YES
WHEREAS THE THINKING MIND INTENDING TO LIGHT UP THE CHAOS WAS
COMPELLED TO REVERSE THE PROCESS AND LOOK AT SMALL AND GREAT AS
SEPARATE AND NOT CONFUSED
VERY TRUE
WAS NOT THIS THE BEGINNING OF THE ENQUIRY 'WHAT IS GREAT AND 'WHAT IS
SMALL
EXACTLY SO
AND THUS AROSE THE DISTINCTION OF THE VISIBLE AND THE INTELLIGIBLE
MOST TRUE
THIS WAS WHAT I MEANT WHEN I SPOKE OF IMPRESSIONS WHICH INVITED THE
INTELLECT OR THE REVERSE THOSE WHICH ARE SIMULTANEOUS WITH OPPOSITE
IMPRESSIONS INVITE THOUGHT THOSE WHICH ARE NOT SIMULTANEOUS DO NOT
I UNDERSTAND HE SAID AND AGREE WITH YOU
AND TO WHICH CLASS DO UNITY AND NUMBER BELONG
I DO NOT KNOW HE REPLIED
THINK A LITTLE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WHAT HAS PRECEDED WILL SUPPLY THE
ANSWER FOR IF SIMPLE UNITY COULD BE ADEQUATELY PERCEIVED BY THE SIGHT
OR BY ANY OTHER SENSE THEN AS WE WERE SAYING IN THE CASE OF THE
FINGER THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO ATTRACT TOWARDS BEING BUT WHEN THERE
IS SOME CONTRADICTION ALWAYS PRESENT AND ONE IS THE REVERSE OF ONE AND
INVOLVES THE CONCEPTION OF PLURALITY THEN THOUGHT BEGINS TO BE AROUSED
WITHIN US AND THE SOUL PERPLEXED AND WANTING TO ARRIVE AT A DECISION
ASKS 'WHAT IS ABSOLUTE UNITY THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH THE STUDY OF THE
ONE HAS A POWER OF DRAWING AND CONVERTING THE MIND TO THE CONTEMPLATION
OF TRUE BEING
AND SURELY HE SAID THIS OCCURS NOTABLY IN THE CASE OF ONE FOR WE SEE
THE SAME THING TO BE BOTH ONE AND INFINITE IN MULTITUDE
YES I SAID AND THIS BEING TRUE OF ONE MUST BE EQUALLY TRUE OF ALL
NUMBER
CERTAINLY
AND ALL ARITHMETIC AND CALCULATION HAVE TO DO WITH NUMBER
YES
AND THEY APPEAR TO LEAD THE MIND TOWARDS TRUTH
YES IN A VERY REMARKABLE MANNER
THEN THIS IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE KIND FOR WHICH WE ARE SEEKING HAVING A
DOUBLE USE MILITARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL FOR THE MAN OF WAR MUST LEARN
THE ART OF NUMBER OR HE WILL NOT KNOW HOW TO ARRAY HIS TROOPS AND THE
PHILOSOPHER ALSO BECAUSE HE HAS TO RISE OUT OF THE SEA OF CHANGE AND
LAY HOLD OF TRUE BEING AND THEREFORE HE MUST BE AN ARITHMETICIAN
THAT IS TRUE
AND OUR GUARDIAN IS BOTH WARRIOR AND PHILOSOPHER
CERTAINLY
THEN THIS IS A KIND OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH LEGISLATION MAY FITLY PRESCRIBE
AND WE MUST ENDEAVOUR TO PERSUADE THOSE WHO ARE TO BE THE PRINCIPAL MEN
OF OUR STATE TO GO AND LEARN ARITHMETIC NOT AS AMATEURS BUT THEY MUST
CARRY ON THE STUDY UNTIL THEY SEE THE NATURE OF NUMBERS WITH THE MIND
ONLY NOR AGAIN LIKE MERCHANTS OR RETAIL TRADERS WITH A VIEW TO BUYING
OR SELLING BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR MILITARY USE AND OF THE SOUL
HERSELF AND BECAUSE THIS WILL BE THE EASIEST WAY FOR HER TO PASS FROM
BECOMING TO TRUTH AND BEING
THAT IS EXCELLENT HE SAID
YES I SAID AND NOW HAVING SPOKEN OF IT I MUST ADD HOW CHARMING THE
SCIENCE IS AND IN HOW MANY WAYS IT CONDUCES TO OUR DESIRED END IF
PURSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF A PHILOSOPHER AND NOT OF A SHOPKEEPER
HOW DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN AS I WAS SAYING THAT ARITHMETIC HAS A VERY GREAT AND ELEVATING
EFFECT COMPELLING THE SOUL TO REASON ABOUT ABSTRACT NUMBER AND
REBELLING AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF VISIBLE OR TANGIBLE OBJECTS INTO
THE ARGUMENT
YOU KNOW HOW STEADILY THE MASTERS OF THE ART REPEL AND
RIDICULE ANY ONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE ABSOLUTE UNITY WHEN HE IS
CALCULATING AND IF YOU DIVIDE THEY MULTIPLY MEANING EITHER 1
THAT THEY INTEGRATE THE NUMBER BECAUSE THEY DENY THE POSSIBILITY OF
FRACTIONS OR 2 THAT DIVISION IS REGARDED BY THEM AS A PROCESS OF
MULTIPLICATION FOR THE FRACTIONS OF ONE CONTINUE TO BE UNITS TAKING
CARE THAT ONE SHALL CONTINUE ONE AND NOT BECOME LOST IN FRACTIONS
THAT IS VERY TRUE
NOW SUPPOSE A PERSON WERE TO SAY TO THEM O MY FRIENDS WHAT ARE THESE
WONDERFUL NUMBERS ABOUT WHICH YOU ARE REASONING IN WHICH AS YOU SAY
THERE IS A UNITY SUCH AS YOU DEMAND AND EACH UNIT IS EQUAL INVARIABLE
INDIVISIBLE WHAT WOULD THEY ANSWER
THEY WOULD ANSWER AS I SHOULD CONCEIVE THAT THEY WERE SPEAKING OF
THOSE NUMBERS WHICH CAN ONLY BE REALIZED IN THOUGHT
THEN YOU SEE THAT THIS KNOWLEDGE MAY BE TRULY CALLED NECESSARY
NECESSITATING AS IT CLEARLY DOES THE USE OF THE PURE INTELLIGENCE IN THE
ATTAINMENT OF PURE TRUTH
YES THAT IS A MARKED CHARACTERISTIC OF IT
AND HAVE YOU FURTHER OBSERVED THAT THOSE WHO HAVE A NATURAL TALENT FOR
CALCULATION ARE GENERALLY QUICK AT EVERY OTHER KIND OF KNOWLEDGE AND
EVEN THE DULL IF THEY HAVE HAD AN ARITHMETICAL TRAINING ALTHOUGH THEY
MAY DERIVE NO OTHER ADVANTAGE FROM IT ALWAYS BECOME MUCH QUICKER THAN
THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND INDEED YOU WILL NOT EASILY FIND A MORE DIFFICULT STUDY AND NOT
MANY AS DIFFICULT
YOU WILL NOT
AND FOR ALL THESE REASONS ARITHMETIC IS A KIND OF KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH
THE BEST NATURES SHOULD BE TRAINED AND WHICH MUST NOT BE GIVEN UP
I AGREE
LET THIS THEN BE MADE ONE OF OUR SUBJECTS OF EDUCATION
AND NEXT SHALL
WE ENQUIRE WHETHER THE KINDRED SCIENCE ALSO CONCERNS US
YOU MEAN GEOMETRY
EXACTLY SO
CLEARLY HE SAID WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT PART OF GEOMETRY WHICH
RELATES TO WAR FOR IN PITCHING A CAMP OR TAKING UP A POSITION
OR CLOSING OR EXTENDING THE LINES OF AN ARMY OR ANY OTHER MILITARY
MANOEUVRE WHETHER IN ACTUAL BATTLE OR ON A MARCH IT WILL MAKE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE WHETHER A GENERAL IS OR IS NOT A GEOMETRICIAN
YES I SAID BUT FOR THAT PURPOSE A VERY LITTLE OF EITHER GEOMETRY OR
CALCULATION WILL BE ENOUGH THE QUESTION RELATES RATHER TO THE GREATER
AND MORE ADVANCED PART OF GEOMETRY WHETHER THAT TENDS IN ANY DEGREE
TO MAKE MORE EASY THE VISION OF THE IDEA OF GOOD AND THITHER AS I WAS
SAYING ALL THINGS TEND WHICH COMPEL THE SOUL TO TURN HER GAZE TOWARDS
THAT PLACE WHERE IS THE FULL PERFECTION OF BEING WHICH SHE OUGHT BY
ALL MEANS TO BEHOLD
TRUE HE SAID
THEN IF GEOMETRY COMPELS US TO VIEW BEING IT CONCERNS US IF BECOMING
ONLY IT DOES NOT CONCERN US
YES THAT IS WHAT WE ASSERT
YET ANYBODY WHO HAS THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE WITH GEOMETRY WILL NOT DENY
THAT SUCH A CONCEPTION OF THE SCIENCE IS IN FLAT CONTRADICTION TO THE
ORDINARY LANGUAGE OF GEOMETRICIANS
HOW SO
THEY HAVE IN VIEW PRACTICE ONLY AND ARE ALWAYS SPEAKING IN A NARROW
AND RIDICULOUS MANNER OF SQUARING AND EXTENDING AND APPLYING AND THE
LIKE THEY CONFUSE THE NECESSITIES OF GEOMETRY WITH THOSE OF DAILY LIFE
WHEREAS KNOWLEDGE IS THE REAL OBJECT OF THE WHOLE SCIENCE
CERTAINLY HE SAID
THEN MUST NOT A FURTHER ADMISSION BE MADE
WHAT ADMISSION
THAT THE KNOWLEDGE AT WHICH GEOMETRY AIMS IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE ETERNAL
AND NOT OF AUGHT PERISHING AND TRANSIENT
THAT HE REPLIED MAY BE READILY ALLOWED AND IS TRUE
THEN MY NOBLE FRIEND GEOMETRY WILL DRAW THE SOUL TOWARDS TRUTH
AND CREATE THE SPIRIT OF PHILOSOPHY AND RAISE UP THAT WHICH IS NOW
UNHAPPILY ALLOWED TO FALL DOWN
NOTHING WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SUCH AN EFFECT
THEN NOTHING SHOULD BE MORE STERNLY LAID DOWN THAN THAT THE INHABITANTS
OF YOUR FAIR CITY SHOULD BY ALL MEANS LEARN GEOMETRY
MOREOVER THE
SCIENCE HAS INDIRECT EFFECTS WHICH ARE NOT SMALL
OF WHAT KIND HE SAID
THERE ARE THE MILITARY ADVANTAGES OF WHICH YOU SPOKE I SAID AND IN ALL
DEPARTMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE AS EXPERIENCE PROVES ANY ONE WHO HAS STUDIED
GEOMETRY IS INFINITELY QUICKER OF APPREHENSION THAN ONE WHO HAS NOT
YES INDEED HE SAID THERE IS AN INFINITE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
THEN SHALL WE PROPOSE THIS AS A SECOND BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH OUR
YOUTH WILL STUDY
LET US DO SO HE REPLIED
AND SUPPOSE WE MAKE ASTRONOMY THE THIRD WHAT DO YOU SAY
I AM STRONGLY INCLINED TO IT HE SAID THE OBSERVATION OF THE SEASONS
AND OF MONTHS AND YEARS IS AS ESSENTIAL TO THE GENERAL AS IT IS TO THE
FARMER OR SAILOR
I AM AMUSED I SAID AT YOUR FEAR OF THE WORLD WHICH MAKES YOU GUARD
AGAINST THE APPEARANCE OF INSISTING UPON USELESS STUDIES AND I QUITE
ADMIT THE DIFFICULTY OF BELIEVING THAT IN EVERY MAN THERE IS AN EYE
OF THE SOUL WHICH WHEN BY OTHER PURSUITS LOST AND DIMMED IS BY THESE
PURIFIED AND RE ILLUMINED AND IS MORE PRECIOUS FAR THAN TEN THOUSAND
BODILY EYES FOR BY IT ALONE IS TRUTH SEEN
NOW THERE ARE TWO CLASSES OF
PERSONS ONE CLASS OF THOSE WHO WILL AGREE WITH YOU AND WILL TAKE
YOUR WORDS AS A REVELATION ANOTHER CLASS TO WHOM THEY WILL BE UTTERLY
UNMEANING AND WHO WILL NATURALLY DEEM THEM TO BE IDLE TALES FOR THEY
SEE NO SORT OF PROFIT WHICH IS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THEM
AND THEREFORE
YOU HAD BETTER DECIDE AT ONCE WITH WHICH OF THE TWO YOU ARE PROPOSING TO
ARGUE
YOU WILL VERY LIKELY SAY WITH NEITHER AND THAT YOUR CHIEF AIM IN
CARRYING ON THE ARGUMENT IS YOUR OWN IMPROVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME YOU
DO NOT GRUDGE TO OTHERS ANY BENEFIT WHICH THEY MAY RECEIVE
I THINK THAT I SHOULD PREFER TO CARRY ON THE ARGUMENT MAINLY ON MY OWN
BEHALF
THEN TAKE A STEP BACKWARD FOR WE HAVE GONE WRONG IN THE ORDER OF THE
SCIENCES
WHAT WAS THE MISTAKE HE SAID
AFTER PLANE GEOMETRY I SAID WE PROCEEDED AT ONCE TO SOLIDS IN
REVOLUTION INSTEAD OF TAKING SOLIDS IN THEMSELVES WHEREAS AFTER THE
SECOND DIMENSION THE THIRD WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH CUBES AND DIMENSIONS
OF DEPTH OUGHT TO HAVE FOLLOWED
THAT IS TRUE SOCRATES BUT SO LITTLE SEEMS TO BE KNOWN AS YET ABOUT
THESE SUBJECTS
WHY YES I SAID AND FOR TWO REASONS IN THE FIRST PLACE NO
GOVERNMENT PATRONISES THEM THIS LEADS TO A WANT OF ENERGY IN THE
PURSUIT OF THEM AND THEY ARE DIFFICULT IN THE SECOND PLACE STUDENTS
CANNOT LEARN THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE A DIRECTOR
BUT THEN A DIRECTOR
CAN HARDLY BE FOUND AND EVEN IF HE COULD AS MATTERS NOW STAND
THE STUDENTS WHO ARE VERY CONCEITED WOULD NOT ATTEND TO HIM
THAT
HOWEVER WOULD BE OTHERWISE IF THE WHOLE STATE BECAME THE DIRECTOR OF
THESE STUDIES AND GAVE HONOUR TO THEM THEN DISCIPLES WOULD WANT TO
COME AND THERE WOULD BE CONTINUOUS AND EARNEST SEARCH AND DISCOVERIES
WOULD BE MADE SINCE EVEN NOW DISREGARDED AS THEY ARE BY THE WORLD AND
MAIMED OF THEIR FAIR PROPORTIONS AND ALTHOUGH NONE OF THEIR VOTARIES
CAN TELL THE USE OF THEM STILL THESE STUDIES FORCE THEIR WAY BY THEIR
NATURAL CHARM AND VERY LIKELY IF THEY HAD THE HELP OF THE STATE THEY
WOULD SOME DAY EMERGE INTO LIGHT
YES HE SAID THERE IS A REMARKABLE CHARM IN THEM
BUT I DO NOT CLEARLY
UNDERSTAND THE CHANGE IN THE ORDER
FIRST YOU BEGAN WITH A GEOMETRY OF
PLANE SURFACES
YES I SAID
AND YOU PLACED ASTRONOMY NEXT AND THEN YOU MADE A STEP BACKWARD
YES AND I HAVE DELAYED YOU BY MY HURRY THE LUDICROUS STATE OF SOLID
GEOMETRY WHICH IN NATURAL ORDER SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED MADE ME PASS
OVER THIS BRANCH AND GO ON TO ASTRONOMY OR MOTION OF SOLIDS
TRUE HE SAID
THEN ASSUMING THAT THE SCIENCE NOW OMITTED WOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE
IF ENCOURAGED BY THE STATE LET US GO ON TO ASTRONOMY WHICH WILL BE
FOURTH
THE RIGHT ORDER HE REPLIED
AND NOW SOCRATES AS YOU REBUKED THE
VULGAR MANNER IN WHICH I PRAISED ASTRONOMY BEFORE MY PRAISE SHALL
BE GIVEN IN YOUR OWN SPIRIT
FOR EVERY ONE AS I THINK MUST SEE THAT
ASTRONOMY COMPELS THE SOUL TO LOOK UPWARDS AND LEADS US FROM THIS WORLD
TO ANOTHER
EVERY ONE BUT MYSELF I SAID TO EVERY ONE ELSE THIS MAY BE CLEAR BUT
NOT TO ME
AND WHAT THEN WOULD YOU SAY
I SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT THOSE WHO ELEVATE ASTRONOMY INTO PHILOSOPHY
APPEAR TO ME TO MAKE US LOOK DOWNWARDS AND NOT UPWARDS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE ASKED
YOU I REPLIED HAVE IN YOUR MIND A TRULY SUBLIME CONCEPTION OF OUR
KNOWLEDGE OF THE THINGS ABOVE
AND I DARE SAY THAT IF A PERSON WERE TO
THROW HIS HEAD BACK AND STUDY THE FRETTED CEILING YOU WOULD STILL THINK
THAT HIS MIND WAS THE PERCIPIENT AND NOT HIS EYES
AND YOU ARE VERY
LIKELY RIGHT AND I MAY BE A SIMPLETON BUT IN MY OPINION THAT
KNOWLEDGE ONLY WHICH IS OF BEING AND OF THE UNSEEN CAN MAKE THE SOUL
LOOK UPWARDS AND WHETHER A MAN GAPES AT THE HEAVENS OR BLINKS ON THE
GROUND SEEKING TO LEARN SOME PARTICULAR OF SENSE I WOULD DENY THAT HE
CAN LEARN FOR NOTHING OF THAT SORT IS MATTER OF SCIENCE HIS SOUL IS
LOOKING DOWNWARDS NOT UPWARDS WHETHER HIS WAY TO KNOWLEDGE IS BY WATER
OR BY LAND WHETHER HE FLOATS OR ONLY LIES ON HIS BACK
I ACKNOWLEDGE HE SAID THE JUSTICE OF YOUR REBUKE
STILL I SHOULD LIKE
TO ASCERTAIN HOW ASTRONOMY CAN BE LEARNED IN ANY MANNER MORE CONDUCIVE
TO THAT KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING
I WILL TELL YOU I SAID THE STARRY HEAVEN WHICH WE BEHOLD IS WROUGHT
UPON A VISIBLE GROUND AND THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE FAIREST AND MOST
PERFECT OF VISIBLE THINGS MUST NECESSARILY BE DEEMED INFERIOR FAR TO
THE TRUE MOTIONS OF ABSOLUTE SWIFTNESS AND ABSOLUTE SLOWNESS WHICH ARE
RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER AND CARRY WITH THEM THAT WHICH IS CONTAINED IN
THEM IN THE TRUE NUMBER AND IN EVERY TRUE FIGURE
NOW THESE ARE TO BE
APPREHENDED BY REASON AND INTELLIGENCE BUT NOT BY SIGHT
TRUE HE REPLIED
THE SPANGLED HEAVENS SHOULD BE USED AS A PATTERN AND WITH A VIEW TO THAT
HIGHER KNOWLEDGE THEIR BEAUTY IS LIKE THE BEAUTY OF FIGURES OR PICTURES
EXCELLENTLY WROUGHT BY THE HAND OF DAEDALUS OR SOME OTHER GREAT ARTIST
WHICH WE MAY CHANCE TO BEHOLD ANY GEOMETRICIAN WHO SAW THEM WOULD
APPRECIATE THE EXQUISITENESS OF THEIR WORKMANSHIP BUT HE WOULD NEVER
DREAM OF THINKING THAT IN THEM HE COULD FIND THE TRUE EQUAL OR THE TRUE
DOUBLE OR THE TRUTH OF ANY OTHER PROPORTION
NO HE REPLIED SUCH AN IDEA WOULD BE RIDICULOUS
AND WILL NOT A TRUE ASTRONOMER HAVE THE SAME FEELING WHEN HE LOOKS AT
THE MOVEMENTS OF THE STARS WILL HE NOT THINK THAT HEAVEN AND THE THINGS
IN HEAVEN ARE FRAMED BY THE CREATOR OF THEM IN THE MOST PERFECT MANNER
BUT HE WILL NEVER IMAGINE THAT THE PROPORTIONS OF NIGHT AND DAY OR OF
BOTH TO THE MONTH OR OF THE MONTH TO THE YEAR OR OF THE STARS TO THESE
AND TO ONE ANOTHER AND ANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE MATERIAL AND VISIBLE
CAN ALSO BE ETERNAL AND SUBJECT TO NO DEVIATION THAT WOULD BE ABSURD
AND IT IS EQUALLY ABSURD TO TAKE SO MUCH PAINS IN INVESTIGATING THEIR
EXACT TRUTH
I QUITE AGREE THOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS BEFORE
THEN I SAID IN ASTRONOMY AS IN GEOMETRY WE SHOULD EMPLOY PROBLEMS
AND LET THE HEAVENS ALONE IF WE WOULD APPROACH THE SUBJECT IN THE RIGHT
WAY AND SO MAKE THE NATURAL GIFT OF REASON TO BE OF ANY REAL USE
THAT HE SAID IS A WORK INFINITELY BEYOND OUR PRESENT ASTRONOMERS
YES I SAID AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH MUST ALSO HAVE A
SIMILAR EXTENSION GIVEN TO THEM IF OUR LEGISLATION IS TO BE OF ANY
VALUE
BUT CAN YOU TELL ME OF ANY OTHER SUITABLE STUDY
NO HE SAID NOT WITHOUT THINKING
MOTION I SAID HAS MANY FORMS AND NOT ONE ONLY TWO OF THEM ARE
OBVIOUS ENOUGH EVEN TO WITS NO BETTER THAN OURS AND THERE ARE OTHERS
AS I IMAGINE WHICH MAY BE LEFT TO WISER PERSONS
BUT WHERE ARE THE TWO
THERE IS A SECOND I SAID WHICH IS THE COUNTERPART OF THE ONE ALREADY
NAMED
AND WHAT MAY THAT BE
THE SECOND I SAID WOULD SEEM RELATIVELY TO THE EARS TO BE WHAT THE
FIRST IS TO THE EYES FOR I CONCEIVE THAT AS THE EYES ARE DESIGNED TO
LOOK UP AT THE STARS SO ARE THE EARS TO HEAR HARMONIOUS MOTIONS AND
THESE ARE SISTER SCIENCES AS THE PYTHAGOREANS SAY AND WE GLAUCON
AGREE WITH THEM
YES HE REPLIED
BUT THIS I SAID IS A LABORIOUS STUDY AND THEREFORE WE HAD BETTER GO
AND LEARN OF THEM AND THEY WILL TELL US WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OTHER
APPLICATIONS OF THESE SCIENCES
AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT
OF OUR OWN HIGHER OBJECT
WHAT IS THAT
THERE IS A PERFECTION WHICH ALL KNOWLEDGE OUGHT TO REACH AND WHICH OUR
PUPILS OUGHT ALSO TO ATTAIN AND NOT TO FALL SHORT OF AS I WAS SAYING
THAT THEY DID IN ASTRONOMY
FOR IN THE SCIENCE OF HARMONY AS YOU
PROBABLY KNOW THE SAME THING HAPPENS
THE TEACHERS OF HARMONY COMPARE
THE SOUNDS AND CONSONANCES WHICH ARE HEARD ONLY AND THEIR LABOUR LIKE
THAT OF THE ASTRONOMERS IS IN VAIN
YES BY HEAVEN HE SAID AND 'TIS AS GOOD AS A PLAY TO HEAR THEM TALKING
ABOUT THEIR CONDENSED NOTES AS THEY CALL THEM THEY PUT THEIR EARS
CLOSE ALONGSIDE OF THE STRINGS LIKE PERSONS CATCHING A SOUND FROM THEIR
NEIGHBOUR'S WALL ONE SET OF THEM DECLARING THAT THEY DISTINGUISH AN
INTERMEDIATE NOTE AND HAVE FOUND THE LEAST INTERVAL WHICH SHOULD BE
THE UNIT OF MEASUREMENT THE OTHERS INSISTING THAT THE TWO SOUNDS HAVE
PASSED INTO THE SAME EITHER PARTY SETTING THEIR EARS BEFORE THEIR
UNDERSTANDING
YOU MEAN I SAID THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO TEASE AND TORTURE THE STRINGS AND
RACK THEM ON THE PEGS OF THE INSTRUMENT I MIGHT CARRY ON THE METAPHOR
AND SPEAK AFTER THEIR MANNER OF THE BLOWS WHICH THE PLECTRUM GIVES
AND MAKE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE STRINGS BOTH OF BACKWARDNESS AND
FORWARDNESS TO SOUND BUT THIS WOULD BE TEDIOUS AND THEREFORE I WILL
ONLY SAY THAT THESE ARE NOT THE MEN AND THAT I AM REFERRING TO THE
PYTHAGOREANS OF WHOM I WAS JUST NOW PROPOSING TO ENQUIRE ABOUT HARMONY
FOR THEY TOO ARE IN ERROR LIKE THE ASTRONOMERS THEY INVESTIGATE THE
NUMBERS OF THE HARMONIES WHICH ARE HEARD BUT THEY NEVER ATTAIN TO
PROBLEMS THAT IS TO SAY THEY NEVER REACH THE NATURAL HARMONIES OF
NUMBER OR REFLECT WHY SOME NUMBERS ARE HARMONIOUS AND OTHERS NOT
THAT HE SAID IS A THING OF MORE THAN MORTAL KNOWLEDGE
A THING I REPLIED WHICH I WOULD RATHER CALL USEFUL THAT IS IF SOUGHT
AFTER WITH A VIEW TO THE BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD BUT IF PURSUED IN ANY OTHER
SPIRIT USELESS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
NOW WHEN ALL THESE STUDIES REACH THE POINT OF INTER COMMUNION AND
CONNECTION WITH ONE ANOTHER AND COME TO BE CONSIDERED IN THEIR MUTUAL
AFFINITIES THEN I THINK BUT NOT TILL THEN WILL THE PURSUIT OF THEM
HAVE A VALUE FOR OUR OBJECTS OTHERWISE THERE IS NO PROFIT IN THEM
I SUSPECT SO BUT YOU ARE SPEAKING SOCRATES OF A VAST WORK
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SAID THE PRELUDE OR WHAT DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT ALL
THIS IS BUT THE PRELUDE TO THE ACTUAL STRAIN WHICH WE HAVE TO LEARN FOR
YOU SURELY WOULD NOT REGARD THE SKILLED MATHEMATICIAN AS A DIALECTICIAN
ASSUREDLY NOT HE SAID I HAVE HARDLY EVER KNOWN A MATHEMATICIAN WHO WAS
CAPABLE OF REASONING
BUT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT MEN WHO ARE UNABLE TO GIVE AND TAKE A REASON
WILL HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH WE REQUIRE OF THEM
NEITHER CAN THIS BE SUPPOSED
AND SO GLAUCON I SAID WE HAVE AT LAST ARRIVED AT THE HYMN OF
DIALECTIC
THIS IS THAT STRAIN WHICH IS OF THE INTELLECT ONLY BUT WHICH
THE FACULTY OF SIGHT WILL NEVERTHELESS BE FOUND TO IMITATE FOR SIGHT
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER WAS IMAGINED BY US AFTER A WHILE TO BEHOLD THE
REAL ANIMALS AND STARS AND LAST OF ALL THE SUN HIMSELF
AND SO WITH
DIALECTIC WHEN A PERSON STARTS ON THE DISCOVERY OF THE ABSOLUTE BY
THE LIGHT OF REASON ONLY AND WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE OF SENSE AND
PERSEVERES UNTIL BY PURE INTELLIGENCE HE ARRIVES AT THE PERCEPTION
OF THE ABSOLUTE GOOD HE AT LAST FINDS HIMSELF AT THE END OF THE
INTELLECTUAL WORLD AS IN THE CASE OF SIGHT AT THE END OF THE VISIBLE
EXACTLY HE SAID
THEN THIS IS THE PROGRESS WHICH YOU CALL DIALECTIC
TRUE
BUT THE RELEASE OF THE PRISONERS FROM CHAINS AND THEIR TRANSLATION
FROM THE SHADOWS TO THE IMAGES AND TO THE LIGHT AND THE ASCENT FROM THE
UNDERGROUND DEN TO THE SUN WHILE IN HIS PRESENCE THEY ARE VAINLY TRYING
TO LOOK ON ANIMALS AND PLANTS AND THE LIGHT OF THE SUN BUT ARE ABLE TO
PERCEIVE EVEN WITH THEIR WEAK EYES THE IMAGES IN THE WATER WHICH ARE
DIVINE AND ARE THE SHADOWS OF TRUE EXISTENCE NOT SHADOWS OF IMAGES
CAST BY A LIGHT OF FIRE WHICH COMPARED WITH THE SUN IS ONLY AN
IMAGE THIS POWER OF ELEVATING THE HIGHEST PRINCIPLE IN THE SOUL TO
THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT WHICH IS BEST IN EXISTENCE WITH WHICH WE MAY
COMPARE THE RAISING OF THAT FACULTY WHICH IS THE VERY LIGHT OF THE BODY
TO THE SIGHT OF THAT WHICH IS BRIGHTEST IN THE MATERIAL AND VISIBLE
WORLD THIS POWER IS GIVEN AS I WAS SAYING BY ALL THAT STUDY AND
PURSUIT OF THE ARTS WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
I AGREE IN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING HE REPLIED WHICH MAY BE HARD TO
BELIEVE YET FROM ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW IS HARDER STILL TO DENY
THIS
HOWEVER IS NOT A THEME TO BE TREATED OF IN PASSING ONLY BUT WILL HAVE
TO BE DISCUSSED AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND SO WHETHER OUR CONCLUSION BE TRUE
OR FALSE LET US ASSUME ALL THIS AND PROCEED AT ONCE FROM THE PRELUDE
OR PREAMBLE TO THE CHIEF STRAIN A PLAY UPON THE GREEK WORD WHICH MEANS
BOTH 'LAW' AND 'STRAIN AND DESCRIBE THAT IN LIKE MANNER
SAY THEN
WHAT IS THE NATURE AND WHAT ARE THE DIVISIONS OF DIALECTIC AND WHAT
ARE THE PATHS WHICH LEAD THITHER FOR THESE PATHS WILL ALSO LEAD TO OUR
FINAL REST
DEAR GLAUCON I SAID YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FOLLOW ME HERE THOUGH
I WOULD DO MY BEST AND YOU SHOULD BEHOLD NOT AN IMAGE ONLY BUT THE
ABSOLUTE TRUTH ACCORDING TO MY NOTION
WHETHER WHAT I TOLD YOU WOULD
OR WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A REALITY I CANNOT VENTURE TO SAY BUT YOU WOULD
HAVE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE REALITY OF THAT I AM CONFIDENT
DOUBTLESS HE REPLIED
BUT I MUST ALSO REMIND YOU THAT THE POWER OF DIALECTIC ALONE CAN REVEAL
THIS AND ONLY TO ONE WHO IS A DISCIPLE OF THE PREVIOUS SCIENCES
OF THAT ASSERTION YOU MAY BE AS CONFIDENT AS OF THE LAST
AND ASSUREDLY NO ONE WILL ARGUE THAT THERE IS ANY OTHER METHOD
OF COMPREHENDING BY ANY REGULAR PROCESS ALL TRUE EXISTENCE OR OF
ASCERTAINING WHAT EACH THING IS IN ITS OWN NATURE FOR THE ARTS IN
GENERAL ARE CONCERNED WITH THE DESIRES OR OPINIONS OF MEN OR ARE
CULTIVATED WITH A VIEW TO PRODUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION OR FOR THE
PRESERVATION OF SUCH PRODUCTIONS AND CONSTRUCTIONS AND AS TO THE
MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES WHICH AS WE WERE SAYING HAVE SOME APPREHENSION
OF TRUE BEING GEOMETRY AND THE LIKE THEY ONLY DREAM ABOUT BEING
BUT NEVER CAN THEY BEHOLD THE WAKING REALITY SO LONG AS THEY LEAVE THE
HYPOTHESES WHICH THEY USE UNEXAMINED AND ARE UNABLE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT
OF THEM
FOR WHEN A MAN KNOWS NOT HIS OWN FIRST PRINCIPLE AND WHEN THE
CONCLUSION AND INTERMEDIATE STEPS ARE ALSO CONSTRUCTED OUT OF HE KNOWS
NOT WHAT HOW CAN HE IMAGINE THAT SUCH A FABRIC OF CONVENTION CAN EVER
BECOME SCIENCE
IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID
THEN DIALECTIC AND DIALECTIC ALONE GOES DIRECTLY TO THE FIRST
PRINCIPLE AND IS THE ONLY SCIENCE WHICH DOES AWAY WITH HYPOTHESES IN
ORDER TO MAKE HER GROUND SECURE THE EYE OF THE SOUL WHICH IS LITERALLY
BURIED IN AN OUTLANDISH SLOUGH IS BY HER GENTLE AID LIFTED UPWARDS
AND SHE USES AS HANDMAIDS AND HELPERS IN THE WORK OF CONVERSION THE
SCIENCES WHICH WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING
CUSTOM TERMS THEM SCIENCES
BUT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OTHER NAME IMPLYING GREATER CLEARNESS
THAN OPINION AND LESS CLEARNESS THAN SCIENCE AND THIS IN OUR PREVIOUS
SKETCH WAS CALLED UNDERSTANDING
BUT WHY SHOULD WE DISPUTE ABOUT NAMES
WHEN WE HAVE REALITIES OF SUCH IMPORTANCE TO CONSIDER
WHY INDEED HE SAID WHEN ANY NAME WILL DO WHICH EXPRESSES THE THOUGHT
OF THE MIND WITH CLEARNESS
AT ANY RATE WE ARE SATISFIED AS BEFORE TO HAVE FOUR DIVISIONS
TWO FOR INTELLECT AND TWO FOR OPINION AND TO CALL THE FIRST DIVISION
SCIENCE THE SECOND UNDERSTANDING THE THIRD BELIEF AND THE FOURTH
PERCEPTION OF SHADOWS OPINION BEING CONCERNED WITH BECOMING AND
INTELLECT WITH BEING AND SO TO MAKE A PROPORTION
AS BEING IS TO BECOMING SO IS PURE INTELLECT TO OPINION
AND AS
INTELLECT IS TO OPINION SO IS SCIENCE TO BELIEF AND UNDERSTANDING TO
THE PERCEPTION OF SHADOWS
BUT LET US DEFER THE FURTHER CORRELATION AND SUBDIVISION OF THE SUBJECTS
OF OPINION AND OF INTELLECT FOR IT WILL BE A LONG ENQUIRY MANY TIMES
LONGER THAN THIS HAS BEEN
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND HE SAID I AGREE
AND DO YOU ALSO AGREE I SAID IN DESCRIBING THE DIALECTICIAN AS ONE WHO
ATTAINS A CONCEPTION OF THE ESSENCE OF EACH THING AND HE WHO DOES NOT
POSSESS AND IS THEREFORE UNABLE TO IMPART THIS CONCEPTION IN
WHATEVER DEGREE HE FAILS MAY IN THAT DEGREE ALSO BE SAID TO FAIL IN
INTELLIGENCE WILL YOU ADMIT SO MUCH
YES HE SAID HOW CAN I DENY IT
AND YOU WOULD SAY THE SAME OF THE CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD UNTIL THE
PERSON IS ABLE TO ABSTRACT AND DEFINE RATIONALLY THE IDEA OF GOOD
AND UNLESS HE CAN RUN THE GAUNTLET OF ALL OBJECTIONS AND IS READY TO
DISPROVE THEM NOT BY APPEALS TO OPINION BUT TO ABSOLUTE TRUTH NEVER
FALTERING AT ANY STEP OF THE ARGUMENT UNLESS HE CAN DO ALL THIS YOU
WOULD SAY THAT HE KNOWS NEITHER THE IDEA OF GOOD NOR ANY OTHER GOOD HE
APPREHENDS ONLY A SHADOW IF ANYTHING AT ALL WHICH IS GIVEN BY OPINION
AND NOT BY SCIENCE DREAMING AND SLUMBERING IN THIS LIFE BEFORE HE
IS WELL AWAKE HERE HE ARRIVES AT THE WORLD BELOW AND HAS HIS FINAL
QUIETUS
IN ALL THAT I SHOULD MOST CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU
AND SURELY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE THE CHILDREN OF YOUR IDEAL STATE WHOM YOU
ARE NURTURING AND EDUCATING IF THE IDEAL EVER BECOMES A REALITY YOU
WOULD NOT ALLOW THE FUTURE RULERS TO BE LIKE POSTS LITERALLY 'LINES
PROBABLY THE STARTING POINT OF A RACE COURSE HAVING NO REASON IN
THEM AND YET TO BE SET IN AUTHORITY OVER THE HIGHEST MATTERS
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN YOU WILL MAKE A LAW THAT THEY SHALL HAVE SUCH AN EDUCATION AS
WILL ENABLE THEM TO ATTAIN THE GREATEST SKILL IN ASKING AND ANSWERING
QUESTIONS
YES HE SAID YOU AND I TOGETHER WILL MAKE IT
DIALECTIC THEN AS YOU WILL AGREE IS THE COPING STONE OF THE SCIENCES
AND IS SET OVER THEM NO OTHER SCIENCE CAN BE PLACED HIGHER THE NATURE
OF KNOWLEDGE CAN NO FURTHER GO
I AGREE HE SAID
BUT TO WHOM WE ARE TO ASSIGN THESE STUDIES AND IN WHAT WAY THEY ARE TO
BE ASSIGNED ARE QUESTIONS WHICH REMAIN TO BE CONSIDERED
YES CLEARLY
YOU REMEMBER I SAID HOW THE RULERS WERE CHOSEN BEFORE
CERTAINLY HE SAID
THE SAME NATURES MUST STILL BE CHOSEN AND THE PREFERENCE AGAIN GIVEN
TO THE SUREST AND THE BRAVEST AND IF POSSIBLE TO THE FAIREST AND
HAVING NOBLE AND GENEROUS TEMPERS THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE NATURAL
GIFTS WHICH WILL FACILITATE THEIR EDUCATION
AND WHAT ARE THESE
SUCH GIFTS AS KEENNESS AND READY POWERS OF ACQUISITION FOR THE MIND
MORE OFTEN FAINTS FROM THE SEVERITY OF STUDY THAN FROM THE SEVERITY OF
GYMNASTICS THE TOIL IS MORE ENTIRELY THE MIND'S OWN AND IS NOT SHARED
WITH THE BODY
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
FURTHER HE OF WHOM WE ARE IN SEARCH SHOULD HAVE A GOOD MEMORY AND BE
AN UNWEARIED SOLID MAN WHO IS A LOVER OF LABOUR IN ANY LINE OR HE WILL
NEVER BE ABLE TO ENDURE THE GREAT AMOUNT OF BODILY EXERCISE AND TO GO
THROUGH ALL THE INTELLECTUAL DISCIPLINE AND STUDY WHICH WE REQUIRE OF
HIM
CERTAINLY HE SAID HE MUST HAVE NATURAL GIFTS
THE MISTAKE AT PRESENT IS THAT THOSE WHO STUDY PHILOSOPHY HAVE NO
VOCATION AND THIS AS I WAS BEFORE SAYING IS THE REASON WHY SHE HAS
FALLEN INTO DISREPUTE HER TRUE SONS SHOULD TAKE HER BY THE HAND AND NOT
BASTARDS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IN THE FIRST PLACE HER VOTARY SHOULD NOT HAVE A LAME OR HALTING
INDUSTRY I MEAN THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE HALF INDUSTRIOUS AND HALF IDLE
AS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A MAN IS A LOVER OF GYMNASTIC AND HUNTING AND ALL
OTHER BODILY EXERCISES BUT A HATER RATHER THAN A LOVER OF THE LABOUR
OF LEARNING OR LISTENING OR ENQUIRING
OR THE OCCUPATION TO WHICH HE
DEVOTES HIMSELF MAY BE OF AN OPPOSITE KIND AND HE MAY HAVE THE OTHER
SORT OF LAMENESS
CERTAINLY HE SAID
AND AS TO TRUTH I SAID IS NOT A SOUL EQUALLY TO BE DEEMED HALT AND
LAME WHICH HATES VOLUNTARY FALSEHOOD AND IS EXTREMELY INDIGNANT AT
HERSELF AND OTHERS WHEN THEY TELL LIES BUT IS PATIENT OF INVOLUNTARY
FALSEHOOD AND DOES NOT MIND WALLOWING LIKE A SWINISH BEAST IN THE MIRE
OF IGNORANCE AND HAS NO SHAME AT BEING DETECTED
TO BE SURE
AND AGAIN IN RESPECT OF TEMPERANCE COURAGE MAGNIFICENCE AND EVERY
OTHER VIRTUE SHOULD WE NOT CAREFULLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TRUE SON
AND THE BASTARD FOR WHERE THERE IS NO DISCERNMENT OF SUCH QUALITIES
STATES AND INDIVIDUALS UNCONSCIOUSLY ERR AND THE STATE MAKES A RULER
AND THE INDIVIDUAL A FRIEND OF ONE WHO BEING DEFECTIVE IN SOME PART OF
VIRTUE IS IN A FIGURE LAME OR A BASTARD
THAT IS VERY TRUE HE SAID
ALL THESE THINGS THEN WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY US AND
IF ONLY THOSE WHOM WE INTRODUCE TO THIS VAST SYSTEM OF EDUCATION AND
TRAINING ARE SOUND IN BODY AND MIND JUSTICE HERSELF WILL HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY AGAINST US AND WE SHALL BE THE SAVIOURS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND
OF THE STATE BUT IF OUR PUPILS ARE MEN OF ANOTHER STAMP THE REVERSE
WILL HAPPEN AND WE SHALL POUR A STILL GREATER FLOOD OF RIDICULE ON
PHILOSOPHY THAN SHE HAS TO ENDURE AT PRESENT
THAT WOULD NOT BE CREDITABLE
CERTAINLY NOT I SAID AND YET PERHAPS IN THUS TURNING JEST INTO
EARNEST I AM EQUALLY RIDICULOUS
IN WHAT RESPECT
I HAD FORGOTTEN I SAID THAT WE WERE NOT SERIOUS AND SPOKE WITH TOO
MUCH EXCITEMENT
FOR WHEN I SAW PHILOSOPHY SO UNDESERVEDLY TRAMPLED
UNDER FOOT OF MEN I COULD NOT HELP FEELING A SORT OF INDIGNATION AT THE
AUTHORS OF HER DISGRACE AND MY ANGER MADE ME TOO VEHEMENT
INDEED I WAS LISTENING AND DID NOT THINK SO
BUT I WHO AM THE SPEAKER FELT THAT I WAS
AND NOW LET ME REMIND YOU
THAT ALTHOUGH IN OUR FORMER SELECTION WE CHOSE OLD MEN WE MUST NOT DO
SO IN THIS
SOLON WAS UNDER A DELUSION WHEN HE SAID THAT A MAN WHEN HE
GROWS OLD MAY LEARN MANY THINGS FOR HE CAN NO MORE LEARN MUCH THAN HE
CAN RUN MUCH YOUTH IS THE TIME FOR ANY EXTRAORDINARY TOIL
OF COURSE
AND THEREFORE CALCULATION AND GEOMETRY AND ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF
INSTRUCTION WHICH ARE A PREPARATION FOR DIALECTIC SHOULD BE PRESENTED
TO THE MIND IN CHILDHOOD NOT HOWEVER UNDER ANY NOTION OF FORCING OUR
SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
WHY NOT
BECAUSE A FREEMAN OUGHT NOT TO BE A SLAVE IN THE ACQUISITION OF
KNOWLEDGE OF ANY KIND
BODILY EXERCISE WHEN COMPULSORY DOES NO HARM
TO THE BODY BUT KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS ACQUIRED UNDER COMPULSION OBTAINS NO
HOLD ON THE MIND
VERY TRUE
THEN MY GOOD FRIEND I SAID DO NOT USE COMPULSION BUT LET EARLY
EDUCATION BE A SORT OF AMUSEMENT YOU WILL THEN BE BETTER ABLE TO FIND
OUT THE NATURAL BENT
THAT IS A VERY RATIONAL NOTION HE SAID
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THE CHILDREN TOO WERE TO BE TAKEN TO SEE THE
BATTLE ON HORSEBACK AND THAT IF THERE WERE NO DANGER THEY WERE TO BE
BROUGHT CLOSE UP AND LIKE YOUNG HOUNDS HAVE A TASTE OF BLOOD GIVEN
THEM
YES I REMEMBER
THE SAME PRACTICE MAY BE FOLLOWED I SAID IN ALL THESE THINGS LABOURS
LESSONS DANGERS AND HE WHO IS MOST AT HOME IN ALL OF THEM OUGHT TO BE
ENROLLED IN A SELECT NUMBER
AT WHAT AGE
AT THE AGE WHEN THE NECESSARY GYMNASTICS ARE OVER THE PERIOD WHETHER OF
TWO OR THREE YEARS WHICH PASSES IN THIS SORT OF TRAINING IS USELESS FOR
ANY OTHER PURPOSE FOR SLEEP AND EXERCISE ARE UNPROPITIOUS TO LEARNING
AND THE TRIAL OF WHO IS FIRST IN GYMNASTIC EXERCISES IS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT TESTS TO WHICH OUR YOUTH ARE SUBJECTED
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
AFTER THAT TIME THOSE WHO ARE SELECTED FROM THE CLASS OF TWENTY YEARS
OLD WILL BE PROMOTED TO HIGHER HONOUR AND THE SCIENCES WHICH THEY
LEARNED WITHOUT ANY ORDER IN THEIR EARLY EDUCATION WILL NOW BE BROUGHT
TOGETHER AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE NATURAL RELATIONSHIP OF THEM
TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO TRUE BEING
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE ONLY KIND OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH TAKES LASTING
ROOT
YES I SAID AND THE CAPACITY FOR SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS THE GREAT CRITERION
OF DIALECTICAL TALENT THE COMPREHENSIVE MIND IS ALWAYS THE DIALECTICAL
I AGREE WITH YOU HE SAID
THESE I SAID ARE THE POINTS WHICH YOU MUST CONSIDER AND THOSE WHO
HAVE MOST OF THIS COMPREHENSION AND WHO ARE MOST STEADFAST IN THEIR
LEARNING AND IN THEIR MILITARY AND OTHER APPOINTED DUTIES WHEN THEY
HAVE ARRIVED AT THE AGE OF THIRTY HAVE TO BE CHOSEN BY YOU OUT OF THE
SELECT CLASS AND ELEVATED TO HIGHER HONOUR AND YOU WILL HAVE TO PROVE
THEM BY THE HELP OF DIALECTIC IN ORDER TO LEARN WHICH OF THEM IS ABLE
TO GIVE UP THE USE OF SIGHT AND THE OTHER SENSES AND IN COMPANY WITH
TRUTH TO ATTAIN ABSOLUTE BEING AND HERE MY FRIEND GREAT CAUTION IS
REQUIRED
WHY GREAT CAUTION
DO YOU NOT REMARK I SAID HOW GREAT IS THE EVIL WHICH DIALECTIC HAS
INTRODUCED
WHAT EVIL HE SAID
THE STUDENTS OF THE ART ARE FILLED WITH LAWLESSNESS
QUITE TRUE HE SAID
DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ANYTHING SO VERY UNNATURAL OR INEXCUSABLE IN
THEIR CASE OR WILL YOU MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR THEM
IN WHAT WAY MAKE ALLOWANCE
I WANT YOU I SAID BY WAY OF PARALLEL TO IMAGINE A SUPPOSITITIOUS SON
WHO IS BROUGHT UP IN GREAT WEALTH HE IS ONE OF A GREAT AND NUMEROUS
FAMILY AND HAS MANY FLATTERERS
WHEN HE GROWS UP TO MANHOOD HE LEARNS
THAT HIS ALLEGED ARE NOT HIS REAL PARENTS BUT WHO THE REAL ARE HE
IS UNABLE TO DISCOVER
CAN YOU GUESS HOW HE WILL BE LIKELY TO BEHAVE
TOWARDS HIS FLATTERERS AND HIS SUPPOSED PARENTS FIRST OF ALL DURING THE
PERIOD WHEN HE IS IGNORANT OF THE FALSE RELATION AND THEN AGAIN WHEN HE
KNOWS OR SHALL I GUESS FOR YOU
IF YOU PLEASE
THEN I SHOULD SAY THAT WHILE HE IS IGNORANT OF THE TRUTH HE WILL BE
LIKELY TO HONOUR HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER AND HIS SUPPOSED RELATIONS
MORE THAN THE FLATTERERS HE WILL BE LESS INCLINED TO NEGLECT THEM WHEN
IN NEED OR TO DO OR SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THEM AND HE WILL BE LESS
WILLING TO DISOBEY THEM IN ANY IMPORTANT MATTER
HE WILL
BUT WHEN HE HAS MADE THE DISCOVERY I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT HE WOULD
DIMINISH HIS HONOUR AND REGARD FOR THEM AND WOULD BECOME MORE DEVOTED
TO THE FLATTERERS THEIR INFLUENCE OVER HIM WOULD GREATLY INCREASE HE
WOULD NOW LIVE AFTER THEIR WAYS AND OPENLY ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND
UNLESS HE WERE OF AN UNUSUALLY GOOD DISPOSITION HE WOULD TROUBLE
HIMSELF NO MORE ABOUT HIS SUPPOSED PARENTS OR OTHER RELATIONS
WELL ALL THAT IS VERY PROBABLE
BUT HOW IS THE IMAGE APPLICABLE TO THE
DISCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY
IN THIS WAY YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PRINCIPLES ABOUT JUSTICE
AND HONOUR WHICH WERE TAUGHT US IN CHILDHOOD AND UNDER THEIR PARENTAL
AUTHORITY WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP OBEYING AND HONOURING THEM
THAT IS TRUE
THERE ARE ALSO OPPOSITE MAXIMS AND HABITS OF PLEASURE WHICH FLATTER AND
ATTRACT THE SOUL BUT DO NOT INFLUENCE THOSE OF US WHO HAVE ANY SENSE OF
RIGHT AND THEY CONTINUE TO OBEY AND HONOUR THE MAXIMS OF THEIR FATHERS
TRUE
NOW WHEN A MAN IS IN THIS STATE AND THE QUESTIONING SPIRIT ASKS WHAT
IS FAIR OR HONOURABLE AND HE ANSWERS AS THE LEGISLATOR HAS TAUGHT HIM
AND THEN ARGUMENTS MANY AND DIVERSE REFUTE HIS WORDS UNTIL HE IS DRIVEN
INTO BELIEVING THAT NOTHING IS HONOURABLE ANY MORE THAN DISHONOURABLE
OR JUST AND GOOD ANY MORE THAN THE REVERSE AND SO OF ALL THE NOTIONS
WHICH HE MOST VALUED DO YOU THINK THAT HE WILL STILL HONOUR AND OBEY
THEM AS BEFORE
IMPOSSIBLE
AND WHEN HE CEASES TO THINK THEM HONOURABLE AND NATURAL AS HERETOFORE
AND HE FAILS TO DISCOVER THE TRUE CAN HE BE EXPECTED TO PURSUE ANY LIFE
OTHER THAN THAT WHICH FLATTERS HIS DESIRES
HE CANNOT
AND FROM BEING A KEEPER OF THE LAW HE IS CONVERTED INTO A BREAKER OF IT
UNQUESTIONABLY
NOW ALL THIS IS VERY NATURAL IN STUDENTS OF PHILOSOPHY SUCH AS I HAVE
DESCRIBED AND ALSO AS I WAS JUST NOW SAYING MOST EXCUSABLE
YES HE SAID AND I MAY ADD PITIABLE
THEREFORE THAT YOUR FEELINGS MAY NOT BE MOVED TO PITY ABOUT OUR
CITIZENS WHO ARE NOW THIRTY YEARS OF AGE EVERY CARE MUST BE TAKEN IN
INTRODUCING THEM TO DIALECTIC
CERTAINLY
THERE IS A DANGER LEST THEY SHOULD TASTE THE DEAR DELIGHT TOO EARLY FOR
YOUNGSTERS AS YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED WHEN THEY FIRST GET THE TASTE
IN THEIR MOUTHS ARGUE FOR AMUSEMENT AND ARE ALWAYS CONTRADICTING AND
REFUTING OTHERS IN IMITATION OF THOSE WHO REFUTE THEM LIKE PUPPY DOGS
THEY REJOICE IN PULLING AND TEARING AT ALL WHO COME NEAR THEM
YES HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING WHICH THEY LIKE BETTER
AND WHEN THEY HAVE MADE MANY CONQUESTS AND RECEIVED DEFEATS AT THE HANDS
OF MANY THEY VIOLENTLY AND SPEEDILY GET INTO A WAY OF NOT BELIEVING
ANYTHING WHICH THEY BELIEVED BEFORE AND HENCE NOT ONLY THEY BUT
PHILOSOPHY AND ALL THAT RELATES TO IT IS APT TO HAVE A BAD NAME WITH THE
REST OF THE WORLD
TOO TRUE HE SAID
BUT WHEN A MAN BEGINS TO GET OLDER HE WILL NO LONGER BE GUILTY OF SUCH
INSANITY HE WILL IMITATE THE DIALECTICIAN WHO IS SEEKING FOR TRUTH AND
NOT THE ERISTIC WHO IS CONTRADICTING FOR THE SAKE OF AMUSEMENT AND THE
GREATER MODERATION OF HIS CHARACTER WILL INCREASE INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING
THE HONOUR OF THE PURSUIT
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND DID WE NOT MAKE SPECIAL PROVISION FOR THIS WHEN WE SAID THAT THE
DISCIPLES OF PHILOSOPHY WERE TO BE ORDERLY AND STEADFAST NOT AS NOW
ANY CHANCE ASPIRANT OR INTRUDER
VERY TRUE
SUPPOSE I SAID THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY TO TAKE THE PLACE OF GYMNASTICS
AND TO BE CONTINUED DILIGENTLY AND EARNESTLY AND EXCLUSIVELY FOR TWICE
THE NUMBER OF YEARS WHICH WERE PASSED IN BODILY EXERCISE WILL THAT BE
ENOUGH
WOULD YOU SAY SIX OR FOUR YEARS HE ASKED
SAY FIVE YEARS I REPLIED AT THE END OF THE TIME THEY MUST BE SENT DOWN
AGAIN INTO THE DEN AND COMPELLED TO HOLD ANY MILITARY OR OTHER OFFICE
WHICH YOUNG MEN ARE QUALIFIED TO HOLD IN THIS WAY THEY WILL GET THEIR
EXPERIENCE OF LIFE AND THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING WHETHER
WHEN THEY ARE DRAWN ALL MANNER OF WAYS BY TEMPTATION THEY WILL STAND
FIRM OR FLINCH
AND HOW LONG IS THIS STAGE OF THEIR LIVES TO LAST
FIFTEEN YEARS I ANSWERED AND WHEN THEY HAVE REACHED FIFTY YEARS OF
AGE THEN LET THOSE WHO STILL SURVIVE AND HAVE DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES
IN EVERY ACTION OF THEIR LIVES AND IN EVERY BRANCH OF KNOWLEDGE COME AT
LAST TO THEIR CONSUMMATION THE TIME HAS NOW ARRIVED AT WHICH THEY MUST
RAISE THE EYE OF THE SOUL TO THE UNIVERSAL LIGHT WHICH LIGHTENS ALL
THINGS AND BEHOLD THE ABSOLUTE GOOD FOR THAT IS THE PATTERN ACCORDING
TO WHICH THEY ARE TO ORDER THE STATE AND THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS AND
THE REMAINDER OF THEIR OWN LIVES ALSO MAKING PHILOSOPHY THEIR CHIEF
PURSUIT BUT WHEN THEIR TURN COMES TOILING ALSO AT POLITICS AND RULING
FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD NOT AS THOUGH THEY WERE PERFORMING SOME HEROIC
ACTION BUT SIMPLY AS A MATTER OF DUTY AND WHEN THEY HAVE BROUGHT UP IN
EACH GENERATION OTHERS LIKE THEMSELVES AND LEFT THEM IN THEIR PLACE TO
BE GOVERNORS OF THE STATE THEN THEY WILL DEPART TO THE ISLANDS OF THE
BLEST AND DWELL THERE AND THE CITY WILL GIVE THEM PUBLIC MEMORIALS AND
SACRIFICES AND HONOUR THEM IF THE PYTHIAN ORACLE CONSENT AS DEMIGODS
BUT IF NOT AS IN ANY CASE BLESSED AND DIVINE
YOU ARE A SCULPTOR SOCRATES AND HAVE MADE STATUES OF OUR GOVERNORS
FAULTLESS IN BEAUTY
YES I SAID GLAUCON AND OF OUR GOVERNESSES TOO FOR YOU MUST NOT
SUPPOSE THAT WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING APPLIES TO MEN ONLY AND NOT TO
WOMEN AS FAR AS THEIR NATURES CAN GO
THERE YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID SINCE WE HAVE MADE THEM TO SHARE IN ALL
THINGS LIKE THE MEN
WELL I SAID AND YOU WOULD AGREE WOULD YOU NOT THAT WHAT HAS
BEEN SAID ABOUT THE STATE AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT A MERE DREAM AND
ALTHOUGH DIFFICULT NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT ONLY POSSIBLE IN THE WAY WHICH
HAS BEEN SUPPOSED THAT IS TO SAY WHEN THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER KINGS ARE
BORN IN A STATE ONE OR MORE OF THEM DESPISING THE HONOURS OF THIS
PRESENT WORLD WHICH THEY DEEM MEAN AND WORTHLESS ESTEEMING ABOVE ALL
THINGS RIGHT AND THE HONOUR THAT SPRINGS FROM RIGHT AND REGARDING
JUSTICE AS THE GREATEST AND MOST NECESSARY OF ALL THINGS WHOSE
MINISTERS THEY ARE AND WHOSE PRINCIPLES WILL BE EXALTED BY THEM WHEN
THEY SET IN ORDER THEIR OWN CITY
HOW WILL THEY PROCEED
THEY WILL BEGIN BY SENDING OUT INTO THE COUNTRY ALL THE INHABITANTS OF
THE CITY WHO ARE MORE THAN TEN YEARS OLD AND WILL TAKE POSSESSION OF
THEIR CHILDREN WHO WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY THE HABITS OF THEIR PARENTS
THESE THEY WILL TRAIN IN THEIR OWN HABITS AND LAWS I MEAN IN THE LAWS
WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN THEM AND IN THIS WAY THE STATE AND CONSTITUTION OF
WHICH WE WERE SPEAKING WILL SOONEST AND MOST EASILY ATTAIN HAPPINESS
AND THE NATION WHICH HAS SUCH A CONSTITUTION WILL GAIN MOST
YES THAT WILL BE THE BEST WAY
AND I THINK SOCRATES THAT YOU HAVE
VERY WELL DESCRIBED HOW IF EVER SUCH A CONSTITUTION MIGHT COME INTO
BEING
ENOUGH THEN OF THE PERFECT STATE AND OF THE MAN WHO BEARS ITS
IMAGE THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN SEEING HOW WE SHALL DESCRIBE HIM
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY HE REPLIED AND I AGREE WITH YOU IN THINKING
THAT NOTHING MORE NEED BE SAID
BOOK VIII
AND SO GLAUCON WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE PERFECT
STATE WIVES AND CHILDREN ARE TO BE IN COMMON AND THAT ALL EDUCATION
AND THE PURSUITS OF WAR AND PEACE ARE ALSO TO BE COMMON AND THE BEST
PHILOSOPHERS AND THE BRAVEST WARRIORS ARE TO BE THEIR KINGS
THAT REPLIED GLAUCON HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED
YES I SAID AND WE HAVE FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE GOVERNORS WHEN
APPOINTED THEMSELVES WILL TAKE THEIR SOLDIERS AND PLACE THEM IN HOUSES
SUCH AS WE WERE DESCRIBING WHICH ARE COMMON TO ALL AND CONTAIN NOTHING
PRIVATE OR INDIVIDUAL AND ABOUT THEIR PROPERTY YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE
AGREED
YES I REMEMBER THAT NO ONE WAS TO HAVE ANY OF THE ORDINARY POSSESSIONS
OF MANKIND THEY WERE TO BE WARRIOR ATHLETES AND GUARDIANS RECEIVING
FROM THE OTHER CITIZENS IN LIEU OF ANNUAL PAYMENT ONLY THEIR
MAINTENANCE AND THEY WERE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND OF THE WHOLE
STATE
TRUE I SAID AND NOW THAT THIS DIVISION OF OUR TASK IS CONCLUDED LET
US FIND THE POINT AT WHICH WE DIGRESSED THAT WE MAY RETURN INTO THE OLD
PATH
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN RETURNING YOU IMPLIED THEN AS NOW THAT YOU
HAD FINISHED THE DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE YOU SAID THAT SUCH A STATE
WAS GOOD AND THAT THE MAN WAS GOOD WHO ANSWERED TO IT ALTHOUGH AS NOW
APPEARS YOU HAD MORE EXCELLENT THINGS TO RELATE BOTH OF STATE AND MAN
AND YOU SAID FURTHER THAT IF THIS WAS THE TRUE FORM THEN THE OTHERS
WERE FALSE AND OF THE FALSE FORMS YOU SAID AS I REMEMBER THAT THERE
WERE FOUR PRINCIPAL ONES AND THAT THEIR DEFECTS AND THE DEFECTS OF
THE INDIVIDUALS CORRESPONDING TO THEM WERE WORTH EXAMINING
WHEN WE HAD
SEEN ALL THE INDIVIDUALS AND FINALLY AGREED AS TO WHO WAS THE BEST AND
WHO WAS THE WORST OF THEM WE WERE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE BEST WAS NOT
ALSO THE HAPPIEST AND THE WORST THE MOST MISERABLE
I ASKED YOU
WHAT WERE THE FOUR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT OF WHICH YOU SPOKE AND THEN
POLEMARCHUS AND ADEIMANTUS PUT IN THEIR WORD AND YOU BEGAN AGAIN AND
HAVE FOUND YOUR WAY TO THE POINT AT WHICH WE HAVE NOW ARRIVED
YOUR RECOLLECTION I SAID IS MOST EXACT
THEN LIKE A WRESTLER HE REPLIED YOU MUST PUT YOURSELF AGAIN IN THE
SAME POSITION AND LET ME ASK THE SAME QUESTIONS AND DO YOU GIVE ME THE
SAME ANSWER WHICH YOU WERE ABOUT TO GIVE ME THEN
YES IF I CAN I WILL I SAID
I SHALL PARTICULARLY WISH TO HEAR WHAT WERE THE FOUR CONSTITUTIONS OF
WHICH YOU WERE SPEAKING
THAT QUESTION I SAID IS EASILY ANSWERED THE FOUR GOVERNMENTS OF WHICH
I SPOKE SO FAR AS THEY HAVE DISTINCT NAMES ARE FIRST THOSE OF CRETE
AND SPARTA WHICH ARE GENERALLY APPLAUDED WHAT IS TERMED OLIGARCHY
COMES NEXT THIS IS NOT EQUALLY APPROVED AND IS A FORM OF GOVERNMENT
WHICH TEEMS WITH EVILS THIRDLY DEMOCRACY WHICH NATURALLY FOLLOWS
OLIGARCHY ALTHOUGH VERY DIFFERENT AND LASTLY COMES TYRANNY GREAT
AND FAMOUS WHICH DIFFERS FROM THEM ALL AND IS THE FOURTH AND WORST
DISORDER OF A STATE
I DO NOT KNOW DO YOU OF ANY OTHER CONSTITUTION
WHICH CAN BE SAID TO HAVE A DISTINCT CHARACTER
THERE ARE LORDSHIPS AND
PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE BOUGHT AND SOLD AND SOME OTHER INTERMEDIATE
FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
BUT THESE ARE NONDESCRIPTS AND MAY BE FOUND EQUALLY
AMONG HELLENES AND AMONG BARBARIANS
YES HE REPLIED WE CERTAINLY HEAR OF MANY CURIOUS FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
WHICH EXIST AMONG THEM
DO YOU KNOW I SAID THAT GOVERNMENTS VARY AS THE DISPOSITIONS OF MEN
VARY AND THAT THERE MUST BE AS MANY OF THE ONE AS THERE ARE OF THE
OTHER FOR WE CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT STATES ARE MADE OF 'OAK AND ROCK AND
NOT OUT OF THE HUMAN NATURES WHICH ARE IN THEM AND WHICH IN A FIGURE
TURN THE SCALE AND DRAW OTHER THINGS AFTER THEM
YES HE SAID THE STATES ARE AS THE MEN ARE THEY GROW OUT OF HUMAN
CHARACTERS
THEN IF THE CONSTITUTIONS OF STATES ARE FIVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF
INDIVIDUAL MINDS WILL ALSO BE FIVE
CERTAINLY
HIM WHO ANSWERS TO ARISTOCRACY AND WHOM WE RIGHTLY CALL JUST AND GOOD
WE HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED
WE HAVE
THEN LET US NOW PROCEED TO DESCRIBE THE INFERIOR SORT OF NATURES BEING
THE CONTENTIOUS AND AMBITIOUS WHO ANSWER TO THE SPARTAN POLITY ALSO
THE OLIGARCHICAL DEMOCRATICAL AND TYRANNICAL
LET US PLACE THE MOST
JUST BY THE SIDE OF THE MOST UNJUST AND WHEN WE SEE THEM WE SHALL BE
ABLE TO COMPARE THE RELATIVE HAPPINESS OR UNHAPPINESS OF HIM WHO LEADS
A LIFE OF PURE JUSTICE OR PURE INJUSTICE
THE ENQUIRY WILL THEN BE
COMPLETED
AND WE SHALL KNOW WHETHER WE OUGHT TO PURSUE INJUSTICE
AS THRASYMACHUS ADVISES OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE
ARGUMENT TO PREFER JUSTICE
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WE MUST DO AS YOU SAY
SHALL WE FOLLOW OUR OLD PLAN WHICH WE ADOPTED WITH A VIEW TO CLEARNESS
OF TAKING THE STATE FIRST AND THEN PROCEEDING TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND
BEGIN WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF HONOUR I KNOW OF NO NAME FOR SUCH A
GOVERNMENT OTHER THAN TIMOCRACY OR PERHAPS TIMARCHY
WE WILL COMPARE
WITH THIS THE LIKE CHARACTER IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND AFTER THAT
CONSIDER OLIGARCHY AND THE OLIGARCHICAL MAN AND THEN AGAIN WE WILL TURN
OUR ATTENTION TO DEMOCRACY AND THE DEMOCRATICAL MAN AND LASTLY WE
WILL GO AND VIEW THE CITY OF TYRANNY AND ONCE MORE TAKE A LOOK INTO THE
TYRANT'S SOUL AND TRY TO ARRIVE AT A SATISFACTORY DECISION
THAT WAY OF VIEWING AND JUDGING OF THE MATTER WILL BE VERY SUITABLE
FIRST THEN I SAID LET US ENQUIRE HOW TIMOCRACY THE GOVERNMENT OF
HONOUR ARISES OUT OF ARISTOCRACY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BEST
CLEARLY
ALL POLITICAL CHANGES ORIGINATE IN DIVISIONS OF THE ACTUAL GOVERNING
POWER A GOVERNMENT WHICH IS UNITED HOWEVER SMALL CANNOT BE MOVED
VERY TRUE HE SAID
IN WHAT WAY THEN WILL OUR CITY BE MOVED AND IN WHAT MANNER WILL THE
TWO CLASSES OF AUXILIARIES AND RULERS DISAGREE AMONG THEMSELVES OR WITH
ONE ANOTHER SHALL WE AFTER THE MANNER OF HOMER PRAY THE MUSES TO TELL
US 'HOW DISCORD FIRST AROSE' SHALL WE IMAGINE THEM IN SOLEMN MOCKERY
TO PLAY AND JEST WITH US AS IF WE WERE CHILDREN AND TO ADDRESS US IN A
LOFTY TRAGIC VEIN MAKING BELIEVE TO BE IN EARNEST
HOW WOULD THEY ADDRESS US
AFTER THIS MANNER A CITY WHICH IS THUS CONSTITUTED CAN HARDLY BE
SHAKEN BUT SEEING THAT EVERYTHING WHICH HAS A BEGINNING HAS ALSO AN
END EVEN A CONSTITUTION SUCH AS YOURS WILL NOT LAST FOR EVER BUT WILL
IN TIME BE DISSOLVED
AND THIS IS THE DISSOLUTION IN PLANTS THAT GROW
IN THE EARTH AS WELL AS IN ANIMALS THAT MOVE ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE
FERTILITY AND STERILITY OF SOUL AND BODY OCCUR WHEN THE CIRCUMFERENCES
OF THE CIRCLES OF EACH ARE COMPLETED WHICH IN SHORT LIVED EXISTENCES
PASS OVER A SHORT SPACE AND IN LONG LIVED ONES OVER A LONG SPACE
BUT
TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN FECUNDITY AND STERILITY ALL THE WISDOM AND
EDUCATION OF YOUR RULERS WILL NOT ATTAIN THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THEM
WILL NOT BE DISCOVERED BY AN INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS ALLOYED WITH SENSE
BUT WILL ESCAPE THEM AND THEY WILL BRING CHILDREN INTO THE WORLD WHEN
THEY OUGHT NOT
NOW THAT WHICH IS OF DIVINE BIRTH HAS A PERIOD WHICH IS
CONTAINED IN A PERFECT NUMBER I E
A CYCLICAL NUMBER SUCH AS 6 WHICH
IS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF ITS DIVISORS 1 2 3 SO THAT WHEN THE CIRCLE
OR TIME REPRESENTED BY 6 IS COMPLETED THE LESSER TIMES OR ROTATIONS
REPRESENTED BY 1 2 3 ARE ALSO COMPLETED BUT THE PERIOD OF
HUMAN BIRTH IS COMPREHENDED IN A NUMBER IN WHICH FIRST INCREMENTS
BY INVOLUTION AND EVOLUTION OR SQUARED AND CUBED OBTAINING THREE
INTERVALS AND FOUR TERMS OF LIKE AND UNLIKE WAXING AND WANING NUMBERS
MAKE ALL THE TERMS COMMENSURABLE AND AGREEABLE TO ONE ANOTHER
PROBABLY
THE NUMBERS 3 4 5 6 OF WHICH THE THREE FIRST THE SIDES OF THE
PYTHAGOREAN TRIANGLE
THE TERMS WILL THEN BE 3 CUBED 4 CUBED 5 CUBED
WHICH TOGETHER 6 CUBED 216 THE BASE OF THESE 3 WITH A THIRD
ADDED 4 WHEN COMBINED WITH FIVE 20 AND RAISED TO THE THIRD POWER
FURNISHES TWO HARMONIES THE FIRST A SQUARE WHICH IS A HUNDRED TIMES
AS GREAT 400 4 X 100 OR THE FIRST A SQUARE WHICH IS 100 X 100
10 000
THE WHOLE NUMBER WILL THEN BE 17 500 A SQUARE OF 100 AND AN
OBLONG OF 100 BY 75 AND THE OTHER A FIGURE HAVING ONE SIDE EQUAL TO
THE FORMER BUT OBLONG CONSISTING OF A HUNDRED NUMBERS SQUARED UPON
RATIONAL DIAMETERS OF A SQUARE I E
OMITTING FRACTIONS THE SIDE OF
WHICH IS FIVE 7 X 7 49 X 100 4900 EACH OF THEM BEING LESS BY ONE
THAN THE PERFECT SQUARE WHICH INCLUDES THE FRACTIONS SC
50 OR LESS
BY OR 'CONSISTING OF TWO NUMBERS SQUARED UPON IRRATIONAL DIAMETERS
ETC
100
FOR OTHER EXPLANATIONS OF THE PASSAGE SEE INTRODUCTION TWO
PERFECT SQUARES OF IRRATIONAL DIAMETERS OF A SQUARE THE SIDE OF WHICH
IS FIVE 50 50 100 AND A HUNDRED CUBES OF THREE 27 X 100 2700
4900 400 8000
NOW THIS NUMBER REPRESENTS A GEOMETRICAL FIGURE
WHICH HAS CONTROL OVER THE GOOD AND EVIL OF BIRTHS
FOR WHEN YOUR
GUARDIANS ARE IGNORANT OF THE LAW OF BIRTHS AND UNITE BRIDE AND
BRIDEGROOM OUT OF SEASON THE CHILDREN WILL NOT BE GOODLY OR
FORTUNATE
AND THOUGH ONLY THE BEST OF THEM WILL BE APPOINTED BY THEIR
PREDECESSORS STILL THEY WILL BE UNWORTHY TO HOLD THEIR FATHERS' PLACES
AND WHEN THEY COME INTO POWER AS GUARDIANS THEY WILL SOON BE FOUND
TO FAIL IN TAKING CARE OF US THE MUSES FIRST BY UNDER VALUING MUSIC
WHICH NEGLECT WILL SOON EXTEND TO GYMNASTIC AND HENCE THE YOUNG MEN OF
YOUR STATE WILL BE LESS CULTIVATED
IN THE SUCCEEDING GENERATION RULERS
WILL BE APPOINTED WHO HAVE LOST THE GUARDIAN POWER OF TESTING THE METAL
OF YOUR DIFFERENT RACES WHICH LIKE HESIOD'S ARE OF GOLD AND SILVER
AND BRASS AND IRON
AND SO IRON WILL BE MINGLED WITH SILVER AND BRASS
WITH GOLD AND HENCE THERE WILL ARISE DISSIMILARITY AND INEQUALITY AND
IRREGULARITY WHICH ALWAYS AND IN ALL PLACES ARE CAUSES OF HATRED
AND WAR
THIS THE MUSES AFFIRM TO BE THE STOCK FROM WHICH DISCORD HAS
SPRUNG WHEREVER ARISING AND THIS IS THEIR ANSWER TO US
YES AND WE MAY ASSUME THAT THEY ANSWER TRULY
WHY YES I SAID OF COURSE THEY ANSWER TRULY HOW CAN THE MUSES SPEAK
FALSELY
AND WHAT DO THE MUSES SAY NEXT
WHEN DISCORD AROSE THEN THE TWO RACES WERE DRAWN DIFFERENT WAYS THE
IRON AND BRASS FELL TO ACQUIRING MONEY AND LAND AND HOUSES AND GOLD AND
SILVER BUT THE GOLD AND SILVER RACES NOT WANTING MONEY BUT HAVING THE
TRUE RICHES IN THEIR OWN NATURE INCLINED TOWARDS VIRTUE AND THE ANCIENT
ORDER OF THINGS
THERE WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN THEM AND AT LAST THEY
AGREED TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR LAND AND HOUSES AMONG INDIVIDUAL OWNERS
AND THEY ENSLAVED THEIR FRIENDS AND MAINTAINERS WHOM THEY HAD FORMERLY
PROTECTED IN THE CONDITION OF FREEMEN AND MADE OF THEM SUBJECTS AND
SERVANTS AND THEY THEMSELVES WERE ENGAGED IN WAR AND IN KEEPING A WATCH
AGAINST THEM
I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE RIGHTLY CONCEIVED THE ORIGIN OF THE CHANGE
AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT WHICH THUS ARISES WILL BE OF A FORM INTERMEDIATE
BETWEEN OLIGARCHY AND ARISTOCRACY
VERY TRUE
SUCH WILL BE THE CHANGE AND AFTER THE CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE HOW WILL
THEY PROCEED CLEARLY THE NEW STATE BEING IN A MEAN BETWEEN OLIGARCHY
AND THE PERFECT STATE WILL PARTLY FOLLOW ONE AND PARTLY THE OTHER AND
WILL ALSO HAVE SOME PECULIARITIES
TRUE HE SAID
IN THE HONOUR GIVEN TO RULERS IN THE ABSTINENCE OF THE WARRIOR CLASS
FROM AGRICULTURE HANDICRAFTS AND TRADE IN GENERAL IN THE INSTITUTION
OF COMMON MEALS AND IN THE ATTENTION PAID TO GYMNASTICS AND MILITARY
TRAINING IN ALL THESE RESPECTS THIS STATE WILL RESEMBLE THE FORMER
TRUE
BUT IN THE FEAR OF ADMITTING PHILOSOPHERS TO POWER BECAUSE THEY ARE NO
LONGER TO BE HAD SIMPLE AND EARNEST BUT ARE MADE UP OF MIXED ELEMENTS
AND IN TURNING FROM THEM TO PASSIONATE AND LESS COMPLEX CHARACTERS WHO
ARE BY NATURE FITTED FOR WAR RATHER THAN PEACE AND IN THE VALUE SET
BY THEM UPON MILITARY STRATAGEMS AND CONTRIVANCES AND IN THE WAGING OF
EVERLASTING WARS THIS STATE WILL BE FOR THE MOST PART PECULIAR
YES
YES I SAID AND MEN OF THIS STAMP WILL BE COVETOUS OF MONEY LIKE THOSE
WHO LIVE IN OLIGARCHIES THEY WILL HAVE A FIERCE SECRET LONGING AFTER
GOLD AND SILVER WHICH THEY WILL HOARD IN DARK PLACES HAVING MAGAZINES
AND TREASURIES OF THEIR OWN FOR THE DEPOSIT AND CONCEALMENT OF THEM
ALSO CASTLES WHICH ARE JUST NESTS FOR THEIR EGGS AND IN WHICH THEY WILL
SPEND LARGE SUMS ON THEIR WIVES OR ON ANY OTHERS WHOM THEY PLEASE
THAT IS MOST TRUE HE SAID
AND THEY ARE MISERLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MEANS OF OPENLY ACQUIRING THE
MONEY WHICH THEY PRIZE THEY WILL SPEND THAT WHICH IS ANOTHER MAN'S ON
THE GRATIFICATION OF THEIR DESIRES STEALING THEIR PLEASURES AND RUNNING
AWAY LIKE CHILDREN FROM THE LAW THEIR FATHER THEY HAVE BEEN SCHOOLED
NOT BY GENTLE INFLUENCES BUT BY FORCE FOR THEY HAVE NEGLECTED HER
WHO IS THE TRUE MUSE THE COMPANION OF REASON AND PHILOSOPHY AND HAVE
HONOURED GYMNASTIC MORE THAN MUSIC
UNDOUBTEDLY HE SAID THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT WHICH YOU DESCRIBE IS A
MIXTURE OF GOOD AND EVIL
WHY THERE IS A MIXTURE I SAID BUT ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY IS
PREDOMINANTLY SEEN THE SPIRIT OF CONTENTION AND AMBITION AND THESE
ARE DUE TO THE PREVALENCE OF THE PASSIONATE OR SPIRITED ELEMENT
ASSUREDLY HE SAID
SUCH IS THE ORIGIN AND SUCH THE CHARACTER OF THIS STATE WHICH HAS BEEN
DESCRIBED IN OUTLINE ONLY THE MORE PERFECT EXECUTION WAS NOT REQUIRED
FOR A SKETCH IS ENOUGH TO SHOW THE TYPE OF THE MOST PERFECTLY JUST AND
MOST PERFECTLY UNJUST AND TO GO THROUGH ALL THE STATES AND ALL THE
CHARACTERS OF MEN OMITTING NONE OF THEM WOULD BE AN INTERMINABLE
LABOUR
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
NOW WHAT MAN ANSWERS TO THIS FORM OF GOVERNMENT HOW DID HE COME INTO
BEING AND WHAT IS HE LIKE
I THINK SAID ADEIMANTUS THAT IN THE SPIRIT OF CONTENTION WHICH
CHARACTERISES HIM HE IS NOT UNLIKE OUR FRIEND GLAUCON
PERHAPS I SAID HE MAY BE LIKE HIM IN THAT ONE POINT BUT THERE ARE
OTHER RESPECTS IN WHICH HE IS VERY DIFFERENT
IN WHAT RESPECTS
HE SHOULD HAVE MORE OF SELF ASSERTION AND BE LESS CULTIVATED AND YET
A FRIEND OF CULTURE AND HE SHOULD BE A GOOD LISTENER BUT NO SPEAKER
SUCH A PERSON IS APT TO BE ROUGH WITH SLAVES UNLIKE THE EDUCATED MAN
WHO IS TOO PROUD FOR THAT AND HE WILL ALSO BE COURTEOUS TO FREEMEN AND
REMARKABLY OBEDIENT TO AUTHORITY HE IS A LOVER OF POWER AND A LOVER OF
HONOUR CLAIMING TO BE A RULER NOT BECAUSE HE IS ELOQUENT OR ON ANY
GROUND OF THAT SORT BUT BECAUSE HE IS A SOLDIER AND HAS PERFORMED FEATS
OF ARMS HE IS ALSO A LOVER OF GYMNASTIC EXERCISES AND OF THE CHASE
YES THAT IS THE TYPE OF CHARACTER WHICH ANSWERS TO TIMOCRACY
SUCH AN ONE WILL DESPISE RICHES ONLY WHEN HE IS YOUNG BUT AS HE GETS
OLDER HE WILL BE MORE AND MORE ATTRACTED TO THEM BECAUSE HE HAS A
PIECE OF THE AVARICIOUS NATURE IN HIM AND IS NOT SINGLE MINDED TOWARDS
VIRTUE HAVING LOST HIS BEST GUARDIAN
WHO WAS THAT SAID ADEIMANTUS
PHILOSOPHY I SAID TEMPERED WITH MUSIC WHO COMES AND TAKES UP HER
ABODE IN A MAN AND IS THE ONLY SAVIOUR OF HIS VIRTUE THROUGHOUT LIFE
GOOD HE SAID
SUCH I SAID IS THE TIMOCRATICAL YOUTH AND HE IS LIKE THE TIMOCRATICAL
STATE
EXACTLY
HIS ORIGIN IS AS FOLLOWS HE IS OFTEN THE YOUNG SON OF A BRAVE FATHER
WHO DWELLS IN AN ILL GOVERNED CITY OF WHICH HE DECLINES THE HONOURS
AND OFFICES AND WILL NOT GO TO LAW OR EXERT HIMSELF IN ANY WAY BUT IS
READY TO WAIVE HIS RIGHTS IN ORDER THAT HE MAY ESCAPE TROUBLE
AND HOW DOES THE SON COME INTO BEING
THE CHARACTER OF THE SON BEGINS TO DEVELOPE WHEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER
COMPLAINING THAT HER HUSBAND HAS NO PLACE IN THE GOVERNMENT OF WHICH
THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT SHE HAS NO PRECEDENCE AMONG OTHER WOMEN
FURTHER WHEN SHE SEES HER HUSBAND NOT VERY EAGER ABOUT MONEY AND
INSTEAD OF BATTLING AND RAILING IN THE LAW COURTS OR ASSEMBLY TAKING
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO HIM QUIETLY AND WHEN SHE OBSERVES THAT HIS THOUGHTS
ALWAYS CENTRE IN HIMSELF WHILE HE TREATS HER WITH VERY CONSIDERABLE
INDIFFERENCE SHE IS ANNOYED AND SAYS TO HER SON THAT HIS FATHER IS
ONLY HALF A MAN AND FAR TOO EASY GOING ADDING ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS
ABOUT HER OWN ILL TREATMENT WHICH WOMEN ARE SO FOND OF REHEARSING
YES SAID ADEIMANTUS THEY GIVE US PLENTY OF THEM AND THEIR COMPLAINTS
ARE SO LIKE THEMSELVES
AND YOU KNOW I SAID THAT THE OLD SERVANTS ALSO WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE ATTACHED TO THE FAMILY FROM TIME TO TIME TALK PRIVATELY IN THE SAME
STRAIN TO THE SON AND IF THEY SEE ANY ONE WHO OWES MONEY TO HIS FATHER
OR IS WRONGING HIM IN ANY WAY AND HE FAILS TO PROSECUTE THEM THEY TELL
THE YOUTH THAT WHEN HE GROWS UP HE MUST RETALIATE UPON PEOPLE OF THIS
SORT AND BE MORE OF A MAN THAN HIS FATHER
HE HAS ONLY TO WALK ABROAD
AND HE HEARS AND SEES THE SAME SORT OF THING THOSE WHO DO THEIR OWN
BUSINESS IN THE CITY ARE CALLED SIMPLETONS AND HELD IN NO ESTEEM WHILE
THE BUSY BODIES ARE HONOURED AND APPLAUDED
THE RESULT IS THAT THE YOUNG
MAN HEARING AND SEEING ALL THESE THINGS HEARING TOO THE WORDS OF
HIS FATHER AND HAVING A NEARER VIEW OF HIS WAY OF LIFE AND MAKING
COMPARISONS OF HIM AND OTHERS IS DRAWN OPPOSITE WAYS WHILE HIS FATHER
IS WATERING AND NOURISHING THE RATIONAL PRINCIPLE IN HIS SOUL THE
OTHERS ARE ENCOURAGING THE PASSIONATE AND APPETITIVE AND HE BEING NOT
ORIGINALLY OF A BAD NATURE BUT HAVING KEPT BAD COMPANY IS AT LAST
BROUGHT BY THEIR JOINT INFLUENCE TO A MIDDLE POINT AND GIVES UP THE
KINGDOM WHICH IS WITHIN HIM TO THE MIDDLE PRINCIPLE OF CONTENTIOUSNESS
AND PASSION AND BECOMES ARROGANT AND AMBITIOUS
YOU SEEM TO ME TO HAVE DESCRIBED HIS ORIGIN PERFECTLY
THEN WE HAVE NOW I SAID THE SECOND FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND THE SECOND
TYPE OF CHARACTER
WE HAVE
NEXT LET US LOOK AT ANOTHER MAN WHO AS AESCHYLUS SAYS
'IS SET OVER AGAINST ANOTHER STATE
OR RATHER AS OUR PLAN REQUIRES BEGIN WITH THE STATE
BY ALL MEANS
I BELIEVE THAT OLIGARCHY FOLLOWS NEXT IN ORDER
AND WHAT MANNER OF GOVERNMENT DO YOU TERM OLIGARCHY
A GOVERNMENT RESTING ON A VALUATION OF PROPERTY IN WHICH THE RICH HAVE
POWER AND THE POOR MAN IS DEPRIVED OF IT
I UNDERSTAND HE REPLIED
OUGHT I NOT TO BEGIN BY DESCRIBING HOW THE CHANGE FROM TIMOCRACY TO
OLIGARCHY ARISES
YES
WELL I SAID NO EYES ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO SEE HOW THE ONE PASSES
INTO THE OTHER
HOW
THE ACCUMULATION OF GOLD IN THE TREASURY OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS IS THE
RUIN OF TIMOCRACY THEY INVENT ILLEGAL MODES OF EXPENDITURE FOR WHAT DO
THEY OR THEIR WIVES CARE ABOUT THE LAW
YES INDEED
AND THEN ONE SEEING ANOTHER GROW RICH SEEKS TO RIVAL HIM AND THUS THE
GREAT MASS OF THE CITIZENS BECOME LOVERS OF MONEY
LIKELY ENOUGH
AND SO THEY GROW RICHER AND RICHER AND THE MORE THEY THINK OF MAKING
A FORTUNE THE LESS THEY THINK OF VIRTUE FOR WHEN RICHES AND VIRTUE ARE
PLACED TOGETHER IN THE SCALES OF THE BALANCE THE ONE ALWAYS RISES AS
THE OTHER FALLS
TRUE
AND IN PROPORTION AS RICHES AND RICH MEN ARE HONOURED IN THE STATE
VIRTUE AND THE VIRTUOUS ARE DISHONOURED
CLEARLY
AND WHAT IS HONOURED IS CULTIVATED AND THAT WHICH HAS NO HONOUR IS
NEGLECTED
THAT IS OBVIOUS
AND SO AT LAST INSTEAD OF LOVING CONTENTION AND GLORY MEN BECOME
LOVERS OF TRADE AND MONEY THEY HONOUR AND LOOK UP TO THE RICH MAN AND
MAKE A RULER OF HIM AND DISHONOUR THE POOR MAN
THEY DO SO
THEY NEXT PROCEED TO MAKE A LAW WHICH FIXES A SUM OF MONEY AS THE
QUALIFICATION OF CITIZENSHIP THE SUM IS HIGHER IN ONE PLACE AND LOWER
IN ANOTHER AS THE OLIGARCHY IS MORE OR LESS EXCLUSIVE AND THEY ALLOW
NO ONE WHOSE PROPERTY FALLS BELOW THE AMOUNT FIXED TO HAVE ANY SHARE IN
THE GOVERNMENT
THESE CHANGES IN THE CONSTITUTION THEY EFFECT BY FORCE
OF ARMS IF INTIMIDATION HAS NOT ALREADY DONE THEIR WORK
VERY TRUE
AND THIS SPEAKING GENERALLY IS THE WAY IN WHICH OLIGARCHY IS
ESTABLISHED
YES HE SAID BUT WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS FORM OF
GOVERNMENT AND WHAT ARE THE DEFECTS OF WHICH WE WERE SPEAKING
FIRST OF ALL I SAID CONSIDER THE NATURE OF THE QUALIFICATION
JUST
THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF PILOTS WERE TO BE CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THEIR
PROPERTY AND A POOR MAN WERE REFUSED PERMISSION TO STEER EVEN THOUGH
HE WERE A BETTER PILOT
YOU MEAN THAT THEY WOULD SHIPWRECK
YES AND IS NOT THIS TRUE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ANYTHING
I SHOULD IMAGINE SO
EXCEPT A CITY OR WOULD YOU INCLUDE A CITY
NAY HE SAID THE CASE OF A CITY IS THE STRONGEST OF ALL INASMUCH AS
THE RULE OF A CITY IS THE GREATEST AND MOST DIFFICULT OF ALL
THIS THEN WILL BE THE FIRST GREAT DEFECT OF OLIGARCHY
CLEARLY
AND HERE IS ANOTHER DEFECT WHICH IS QUITE AS BAD
WHAT DEFECT
THE INEVITABLE DIVISION SUCH A STATE IS NOT ONE BUT TWO STATES THE
ONE OF POOR THE OTHER OF RICH MEN AND THEY ARE LIVING ON THE SAME SPOT
AND ALWAYS CONSPIRING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER
THAT SURELY IS AT LEAST AS BAD
ANOTHER DISCREDITABLE FEATURE IS THAT FOR A LIKE REASON THEY ARE
INCAPABLE OF CARRYING ON ANY WAR
EITHER THEY ARM THE MULTITUDE AND
THEN THEY ARE MORE AFRAID OF THEM THAN OF THE ENEMY OR IF THEY DO NOT
CALL THEM OUT IN THE HOUR OF BATTLE THEY ARE OLIGARCHS INDEED FEW TO
FIGHT AS THEY ARE FEW TO RULE
AND AT THE SAME TIME THEIR FONDNESS FOR
MONEY MAKES THEM UNWILLING TO PAY TAXES
HOW DISCREDITABLE
AND AS WE SAID BEFORE UNDER SUCH A CONSTITUTION THE SAME PERSONS HAVE
TOO MANY CALLINGS THEY ARE HUSBANDMEN TRADESMEN WARRIORS ALL IN ONE
DOES THAT LOOK WELL
ANYTHING BUT WELL
THERE IS ANOTHER EVIL WHICH IS PERHAPS THE GREATEST OF ALL AND TO
WHICH THIS STATE FIRST BEGINS TO BE LIABLE
WHAT EVIL
A MAN MAY SELL ALL THAT HE HAS AND ANOTHER MAY ACQUIRE HIS PROPERTY
YET AFTER THE SALE HE MAY DWELL IN THE CITY OF WHICH HE IS NO LONGER A
PART BEING NEITHER TRADER NOR ARTISAN NOR HORSEMAN NOR HOPLITE BUT
ONLY A POOR HELPLESS CREATURE
YES THAT IS AN EVIL WHICH ALSO FIRST BEGINS IN THIS STATE
THE EVIL IS CERTAINLY NOT PREVENTED THERE FOR OLIGARCHIES HAVE BOTH THE
EXTREMES OF GREAT WEALTH AND UTTER POVERTY
TRUE
BUT THINK AGAIN IN HIS WEALTHY DAYS WHILE HE WAS SPENDING HIS MONEY
WAS A MAN OF THIS SORT A WHIT MORE GOOD TO THE STATE FOR THE PURPOSES
OF CITIZENSHIP OR DID HE ONLY SEEM TO BE A MEMBER OF THE RULING
BODY ALTHOUGH IN TRUTH HE WAS NEITHER RULER NOR SUBJECT BUT JUST A
SPENDTHRIFT
AS YOU SAY HE SEEMED TO BE A RULER BUT WAS ONLY A SPENDTHRIFT
MAY WE NOT SAY THAT THIS IS THE DRONE IN THE HOUSE WHO IS LIKE THE DRONE
IN THE HONEYCOMB AND THAT THE ONE IS THE PLAGUE OF THE CITY AS THE
OTHER IS OF THE HIVE
JUST SO SOCRATES
AND GOD HAS MADE THE FLYING DRONES ADEIMANTUS ALL WITHOUT STINGS
WHEREAS OF THE WALKING DRONES HE HAS MADE SOME WITHOUT STINGS BUT OTHERS
HAVE DREADFUL STINGS OF THE STINGLESS CLASS ARE THOSE WHO IN THEIR OLD
AGE END AS PAUPERS OF THE STINGERS COME ALL THE CRIMINAL CLASS AS THEY
ARE TERMED
MOST TRUE HE SAID
CLEARLY THEN WHENEVER YOU SEE PAUPERS IN A STATE SOMEWHERE IN THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD THERE ARE HIDDEN AWAY THIEVES AND CUT PURSES AND ROBBERS
OF TEMPLES AND ALL SORTS OF MALEFACTORS
CLEARLY
WELL I SAID AND IN OLIGARCHICAL STATES DO YOU NOT FIND PAUPERS
YES HE SAID NEARLY EVERYBODY IS A PAUPER WHO IS NOT A RULER
AND MAY WE BE SO BOLD AS TO AFFIRM THAT THERE ARE ALSO MANY CRIMINALS TO
BE FOUND IN THEM ROGUES WHO HAVE STINGS AND WHOM THE AUTHORITIES ARE
CAREFUL TO RESTRAIN BY FORCE
CERTAINLY WE MAY BE SO BOLD
THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH PERSONS IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO WANT OF EDUCATION
ILL TRAINING AND AN EVIL CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE
TRUE
SUCH THEN IS THE FORM AND SUCH ARE THE EVILS OF OLIGARCHY AND THERE
MAY BE MANY OTHER EVILS
VERY LIKELY
THEN OLIGARCHY OR THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THE RULERS ARE
ELECTED FOR THEIR WEALTH MAY NOW BE DISMISSED
LET US NEXT PROCEED TO
CONSIDER THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ANSWERS TO THIS
STATE
BY ALL MEANS
DOES NOT THE TIMOCRATICAL MAN CHANGE INTO THE OLIGARCHICAL ON THIS WISE
HOW
A TIME ARRIVES WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVE OF TIMOCRACY HAS A SON AT FIRST
HE BEGINS BY EMULATING HIS FATHER AND WALKING IN HIS FOOTSTEPS BUT
PRESENTLY HE SEES HIM OF A SUDDEN FOUNDERING AGAINST THE STATE AS UPON
A SUNKEN REEF AND HE AND ALL THAT HE HAS IS LOST HE MAY HAVE BEEN
A GENERAL OR SOME OTHER HIGH OFFICER WHO IS BROUGHT TO TRIAL UNDER A
PREJUDICE RAISED BY INFORMERS AND EITHER PUT TO DEATH OR EXILED OR
DEPRIVED OF THE PRIVILEGES OF A CITIZEN AND ALL HIS PROPERTY TAKEN FROM
HIM
NOTHING MORE LIKELY
AND THE SON HAS SEEN AND KNOWN ALL THIS HE IS A RUINED MAN AND HIS
FEAR HAS TAUGHT HIM TO KNOCK AMBITION AND PASSION HEADFOREMOST FROM HIS
BOSOM'S THRONE HUMBLED BY POVERTY HE TAKES TO MONEY MAKING AND BY MEAN
AND MISERLY SAVINGS AND HARD WORK GETS A FORTUNE TOGETHER
IS NOT SUCH
AN ONE LIKELY TO SEAT THE CONCUPISCENT AND COVETOUS ELEMENT ON THE
VACANT THRONE AND TO SUFFER IT TO PLAY THE GREAT KING WITHIN HIM GIRT
WITH TIARA AND CHAIN AND SCIMITAR
MOST TRUE HE REPLIED
AND WHEN HE HAS MADE REASON AND SPIRIT SIT DOWN ON THE GROUND OBEDIENTLY
ON EITHER SIDE OF THEIR SOVEREIGN AND TAUGHT THEM TO KNOW THEIR PLACE
HE COMPELS THE ONE TO THINK ONLY OF HOW LESSER SUMS MAY BE TURNED INTO
LARGER ONES AND WILL NOT ALLOW THE OTHER TO WORSHIP AND ADMIRE ANYTHING
BUT RICHES AND RICH MEN OR TO BE AMBITIOUS OF ANYTHING SO MUCH AS THE
ACQUISITION OF WEALTH AND THE MEANS OF ACQUIRING IT
OF ALL CHANGES HE SAID THERE IS NONE SO SPEEDY OR SO SURE AS THE
CONVERSION OF THE AMBITIOUS YOUTH INTO THE AVARICIOUS ONE
AND THE AVARICIOUS I SAID IS THE OLIGARCHICAL YOUTH
YES HE SAID AT ANY RATE THE INDIVIDUAL OUT OF WHOM HE CAME IS LIKE THE
STATE OUT OF WHICH OLIGARCHY CAME
LET US THEN CONSIDER WHETHER THERE IS ANY LIKENESS BETWEEN THEM
VERY GOOD
FIRST THEN THEY RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER IN THE VALUE WHICH THEY SET UPON
WEALTH
CERTAINLY
ALSO IN THEIR PENURIOUS LABORIOUS CHARACTER THE INDIVIDUAL ONLY
SATISFIES HIS NECESSARY APPETITES AND CONFINES HIS EXPENDITURE TO THEM
HIS OTHER DESIRES HE SUBDUES UNDER THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE UNPROFITABLE
TRUE
HE IS A SHABBY FELLOW WHO SAVES SOMETHING OUT OF EVERYTHING AND MAKES A
PURSE FOR HIMSELF AND THIS IS THE SORT OF MAN WHOM THE VULGAR APPLAUD
IS HE NOT A TRUE IMAGE OF THE STATE WHICH HE REPRESENTS
HE APPEARS TO ME TO BE SO AT ANY RATE MONEY IS HIGHLY VALUED BY HIM AS
WELL AS BY THE STATE
YOU SEE THAT HE IS NOT A MAN OF CULTIVATION I SAID
I IMAGINE NOT HE SAID HAD HE BEEN EDUCATED HE WOULD NEVER HAVE MADE A
BLIND GOD DIRECTOR OF HIS CHORUS OR GIVEN HIM CHIEF HONOUR
EXCELLENT I SAID
YET CONSIDER MUST WE NOT FURTHER ADMIT THAT OWING TO
THIS WANT OF CULTIVATION THERE WILL BE FOUND IN HIM DRONELIKE DESIRES AS
OF PAUPER AND ROGUE WHICH ARE FORCIBLY KEPT DOWN BY HIS GENERAL HABIT
OF LIFE
TRUE
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LOOK IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER HIS
ROGUERIES
WHERE MUST I LOOK
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM WHERE HE HAS SOME GREAT OPPORTUNITY OF ACTING
DISHONESTLY AS IN THE GUARDIANSHIP OF AN ORPHAN
AYE
IT WILL BE CLEAR ENOUGH THEN THAT IN HIS ORDINARY DEALINGS WHICH GIVE
HIM A REPUTATION FOR HONESTY HE COERCES HIS BAD PASSIONS BY AN ENFORCED
VIRTUE NOT MAKING THEM SEE THAT THEY ARE WRONG OR TAMING THEM BY
REASON BUT BY NECESSITY AND FEAR CONSTRAINING THEM AND BECAUSE HE
TREMBLES FOR HIS POSSESSIONS
TO BE SURE
YES INDEED MY DEAR FRIEND BUT YOU WILL FIND THAT THE NATURAL DESIRES
OF THE DRONE COMMONLY EXIST IN HIM ALL THE SAME WHENEVER HE HAS TO SPEND
WHAT IS NOT HIS OWN
YES AND THEY WILL BE STRONG IN HIM TOO
THE MAN THEN WILL BE AT WAR WITH HIMSELF HE WILL BE TWO MEN AND NOT
ONE BUT IN GENERAL HIS BETTER DESIRES WILL BE FOUND TO PREVAIL OVER
HIS INFERIOR ONES
TRUE
FOR THESE REASONS SUCH AN ONE WILL BE MORE RESPECTABLE THAN MOST PEOPLE
YET THE TRUE VIRTUE OF A UNANIMOUS AND HARMONIOUS SOUL WILL FLEE FAR
AWAY AND NEVER COME NEAR HIM
I SHOULD EXPECT SO
AND SURELY THE MISER INDIVIDUALLY WILL BE AN IGNOBLE COMPETITOR IN A
STATE FOR ANY PRIZE OF VICTORY OR OTHER OBJECT OF HONOURABLE AMBITION
HE WILL NOT SPEND HIS MONEY IN THE CONTEST FOR GLORY SO AFRAID IS HE OF
AWAKENING HIS EXPENSIVE APPETITES AND INVITING THEM TO HELP AND JOIN IN
THE STRUGGLE IN TRUE OLIGARCHICAL FASHION HE FIGHTS WITH A SMALL PART
ONLY OF HIS RESOURCES AND THE RESULT COMMONLY IS THAT HE LOSES THE
PRIZE AND SAVES HIS MONEY
VERY TRUE
CAN WE ANY LONGER DOUBT THEN THAT THE MISER AND MONEY MAKER ANSWERS TO
THE OLIGARCHICAL STATE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT
NEXT COMES DEMOCRACY OF THIS THE ORIGIN AND NATURE HAVE STILL TO
BE CONSIDERED BY US AND THEN WE WILL ENQUIRE INTO THE WAYS OF THE
DEMOCRATIC MAN AND BRING HIM UP FOR JUDGMENT
THAT HE SAID IS OUR METHOD
WELL I SAID AND HOW DOES THE CHANGE FROM OLIGARCHY INTO DEMOCRACY
ARISE IS IT NOT ON THIS WISE THE GOOD AT WHICH SUCH A STATE AIMS IS
TO BECOME AS RICH AS POSSIBLE A DESIRE WHICH IS INSATIABLE
WHAT THEN
THE RULERS BEING AWARE THAT THEIR POWER RESTS UPON THEIR WEALTH REFUSE
TO CURTAIL BY LAW THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF THE SPENDTHRIFT YOUTH BECAUSE
THEY GAIN BY THEIR RUIN THEY TAKE INTEREST FROM THEM AND BUY UP THEIR
ESTATES AND THUS INCREASE THEIR OWN WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE
TO BE SURE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE LOVE OF WEALTH AND THE SPIRIT OF
MODERATION CANNOT EXIST TOGETHER IN CITIZENS OF THE SAME STATE TO ANY
CONSIDERABLE EXTENT ONE OR THE OTHER WILL BE DISREGARDED
THAT IS TOLERABLY CLEAR
AND IN OLIGARCHICAL STATES FROM THE GENERAL SPREAD OF CARELESSNESS AND
EXTRAVAGANCE MEN OF GOOD FAMILY HAVE OFTEN BEEN REDUCED TO BEGGARY
YES OFTEN
AND STILL THEY REMAIN IN THE CITY THERE THEY ARE READY TO STING AND
FULLY ARMED AND SOME OF THEM OWE MONEY SOME HAVE FORFEITED THEIR
CITIZENSHIP A THIRD CLASS ARE IN BOTH PREDICAMENTS AND THEY HATE
AND CONSPIRE AGAINST THOSE WHO HAVE GOT THEIR PROPERTY AND AGAINST
EVERYBODY ELSE AND ARE EAGER FOR REVOLUTION
THAT IS TRUE
ON THE OTHER HAND THE MEN OF BUSINESS STOOPING AS THEY WALK AND
PRETENDING NOT EVEN TO SEE THOSE WHOM THEY HAVE ALREADY RUINED INSERT
THEIR STING THAT IS THEIR MONEY INTO SOME ONE ELSE WHO IS NOT ON
HIS GUARD AGAINST THEM AND RECOVER THE PARENT SUM MANY TIMES OVER
MULTIPLIED INTO A FAMILY OF CHILDREN AND SO THEY MAKE DRONE AND PAUPER
TO ABOUND IN THE STATE
YES HE SAID THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEM THAT IS CERTAIN
THE EVIL BLAZES UP LIKE A FIRE AND THEY WILL NOT EXTINGUISH IT EITHER
BY RESTRICTING A MAN'S USE OF HIS OWN PROPERTY OR BY ANOTHER REMEDY
WHAT OTHER
ONE WHICH IS THE NEXT BEST AND HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF COMPELLING THE
CITIZENS TO LOOK TO THEIR CHARACTERS LET THERE BE A GENERAL RULE THAT
EVERY ONE SHALL ENTER INTO VOLUNTARY CONTRACTS AT HIS OWN RISK AND
THERE WILL BE LESS OF THIS SCANDALOUS MONEY MAKING AND THE EVILS OF
WHICH WE WERE SPEAKING WILL BE GREATLY LESSENED IN THE STATE
YES THEY WILL BE GREATLY LESSENED
AT PRESENT THE GOVERNORS INDUCED BY THE MOTIVES WHICH I HAVE NAMED
TREAT THEIR SUBJECTS BADLY WHILE THEY AND THEIR ADHERENTS ESPECIALLY
THE YOUNG MEN OF THE GOVERNING CLASS ARE HABITUATED TO LEAD A LIFE
OF LUXURY AND IDLENESS BOTH OF BODY AND MIND THEY DO NOTHING AND ARE
INCAPABLE OF RESISTING EITHER PLEASURE OR PAIN
VERY TRUE
THEY THEMSELVES CARE ONLY FOR MAKING MONEY AND ARE AS INDIFFERENT AS
THE PAUPER TO THE CULTIVATION OF VIRTUE
YES QUITE AS INDIFFERENT
SUCH IS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WHICH PREVAILS AMONG THEM
AND OFTEN RULERS
AND THEIR SUBJECTS MAY COME IN ONE ANOTHER'S WAY WHETHER ON A JOURNEY
OR ON SOME OTHER OCCASION OF MEETING ON A PILGRIMAGE OR A MARCH
AS FELLOW SOLDIERS OR FELLOW SAILORS AYE AND THEY MAY OBSERVE THE
BEHAVIOUR OF EACH OTHER IN THE VERY MOMENT OF DANGER FOR WHERE DANGER
IS THERE IS NO FEAR THAT THE POOR WILL BE DESPISED BY THE RICH AND
VERY LIKELY THE WIRY SUNBURNT POOR MAN MAY BE PLACED IN BATTLE AT THE
SIDE OF A WEALTHY ONE WHO HAS NEVER SPOILT HIS COMPLEXION AND HAS
PLENTY OF SUPERFLUOUS FLESH WHEN HE SEES SUCH AN ONE PUFFING AND AT HIS
WITS' END HOW CAN HE AVOID DRAWING THE CONCLUSION THAT MEN LIKE HIM ARE
ONLY RICH BECAUSE NO ONE HAS THE COURAGE TO DESPOIL THEM AND WHEN THEY
MEET IN PRIVATE WILL NOT PEOPLE BE SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER 'OUR WARRIORS
ARE NOT GOOD FOR MUCH'
YES HE SAID I AM QUITE AWARE THAT THIS IS THEIR WAY OF TALKING
AND AS IN A BODY WHICH IS DISEASED THE ADDITION OF A TOUCH FROM WITHOUT
MAY BRING ON ILLNESS AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO EXTERNAL
PROVOCATION A COMMOTION MAY ARISE WITHIN IN THE SAME WAY WHEREVER THERE
IS WEAKNESS IN THE STATE THERE IS ALSO LIKELY TO BE ILLNESS OF WHICH
THE OCCASION MAY BE VERY SLIGHT THE ONE PARTY INTRODUCING FROM WITHOUT
THEIR OLIGARCHICAL THE OTHER THEIR DEMOCRATICAL ALLIES AND THEN
THE STATE FALLS SICK AND IS AT WAR WITH HERSELF AND MAY BE AT TIMES
DISTRACTED EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO EXTERNAL CAUSE
YES SURELY
AND THEN DEMOCRACY COMES INTO BEING AFTER THE POOR HAVE CONQUERED THEIR
OPPONENTS SLAUGHTERING SOME AND BANISHING SOME WHILE TO THE REMAINDER
THEY GIVE AN EQUAL SHARE OF FREEDOM AND POWER AND THIS IS THE FORM OF
GOVERNMENT IN WHICH THE MAGISTRATES ARE COMMONLY ELECTED BY LOT
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE NATURE OF DEMOCRACY WHETHER THE REVOLUTION
HAS BEEN EFFECTED BY ARMS OR WHETHER FEAR HAS CAUSED THE OPPOSITE PARTY
TO WITHDRAW
AND NOW WHAT IS THEIR MANNER OF LIFE AND WHAT SORT OF A GOVERNMENT HAVE
THEY FOR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS SUCH WILL BE THE MAN
CLEARLY HE SAID
IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE THEY NOT FREE AND IS NOT THE CITY FULL OF
FREEDOM AND FRANKNESS A MAN MAY SAY AND DO WHAT HE LIKES
'TIS SAID SO HE REPLIED
AND WHERE FREEDOM IS THE INDIVIDUAL IS CLEARLY ABLE TO ORDER FOR
HIMSELF HIS OWN LIFE AS HE PLEASES
CLEARLY
THEN IN THIS KIND OF STATE THERE WILL BE THE GREATEST VARIETY OF HUMAN
NATURES
THERE WILL
THIS THEN SEEMS LIKELY TO BE THE FAIREST OF STATES BEING LIKE AN
EMBROIDERED ROBE WHICH IS SPANGLED WITH EVERY SORT OF FLOWER
AND JUST
AS WOMEN AND CHILDREN THINK A VARIETY OF COLOURS TO BE OF ALL THINGS
MOST CHARMING SO THERE ARE MANY MEN TO WHOM THIS STATE WHICH IS
SPANGLED WITH THE MANNERS AND CHARACTERS OF MANKIND WILL APPEAR TO BE
THE FAIREST OF STATES
YES
YES MY GOOD SIR AND THERE WILL BE NO BETTER IN WHICH TO LOOK FOR A
GOVERNMENT
WHY
BECAUSE OF THE LIBERTY WHICH REIGNS THERE THEY HAVE A COMPLETE
ASSORTMENT OF CONSTITUTIONS AND HE WHO HAS A MIND TO ESTABLISH A STATE
AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING MUST GO TO A DEMOCRACY AS HE WOULD TO A BAZAAR AT
WHICH THEY SELL THEM AND PICK OUT THE ONE THAT SUITS HIM THEN WHEN HE
HAS MADE HIS CHOICE HE MAY FOUND HIS STATE
HE WILL BE SURE TO HAVE PATTERNS ENOUGH
AND THERE BEING NO NECESSITY I SAID FOR YOU TO GOVERN IN THIS STATE
EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY OR TO BE GOVERNED UNLESS YOU LIKE OR
GO TO WAR WHEN THE REST GO TO WAR OR TO BE AT PEACE WHEN OTHERS ARE
AT PEACE UNLESS YOU ARE SO DISPOSED THERE BEING NO NECESSITY ALSO
BECAUSE SOME LAW FORBIDS YOU TO HOLD OFFICE OR BE A DICAST THAT YOU
SHOULD NOT HOLD OFFICE OR BE A DICAST IF YOU HAVE A FANCY IS NOT THIS
A WAY OF LIFE WHICH FOR THE MOMENT IS SUPREMELY DELIGHTFUL
FOR THE MOMENT YES
AND IS NOT THEIR HUMANITY TO THE CONDEMNED IN SOME CASES QUITE CHARMING
HAVE YOU NOT OBSERVED HOW IN A DEMOCRACY MANY PERSONS ALTHOUGH THEY
HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH OR EXILE JUST STAY WHERE THEY ARE AND WALK
ABOUT THE WORLD THE GENTLEMAN PARADES LIKE A HERO AND NOBODY SEES OR
CARES
YES HE REPLIED MANY AND MANY A ONE
SEE TOO I SAID THE FORGIVING SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY AND THE 'DON'T
CARE' ABOUT TRIFLES AND THE DISREGARD WHICH SHE SHOWS OF ALL THE FINE
PRINCIPLES WHICH WE SOLEMNLY LAID DOWN AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE CITY AS
WHEN WE SAID THAT EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF SOME RARELY GIFTED NATURE
THERE NEVER WILL BE A GOOD MAN WHO HAS NOT FROM HIS CHILDHOOD BEEN USED
TO PLAY AMID THINGS OF BEAUTY AND MAKE OF THEM A JOY AND A STUDY HOW
GRANDLY DOES SHE TRAMPLE ALL THESE FINE NOTIONS OF OURS UNDER HER FEET
NEVER GIVING A THOUGHT TO THE PURSUITS WHICH MAKE A STATESMAN AND
PROMOTING TO HONOUR ANY ONE WHO PROFESSES TO BE THE PEOPLE'S FRIEND
YES SHE IS OF A NOBLE SPIRIT
THESE AND OTHER KINDRED CHARACTERISTICS ARE PROPER TO DEMOCRACY WHICH
IS A CHARMING FORM OF GOVERNMENT FULL OF VARIETY AND DISORDER AND
DISPENSING A SORT OF EQUALITY TO EQUALS AND UNEQUALS ALIKE
WE KNOW HER WELL
CONSIDER NOW I SAID WHAT MANNER OF MAN THE INDIVIDUAL IS OR RATHER
CONSIDER AS IN THE CASE OF THE STATE HOW HE COMES INTO BEING
VERY GOOD HE SAID
IS NOT THIS THE WAY HE IS THE SON OF THE MISERLY AND OLIGARCHICAL
FATHER WHO HAS TRAINED HIM IN HIS OWN HABITS
EXACTLY
AND LIKE HIS FATHER HE KEEPS UNDER BY FORCE THE PLEASURES WHICH ARE OF
THE SPENDING AND NOT OF THE GETTING SORT BEING THOSE WHICH ARE CALLED
UNNECESSARY
OBVIOUSLY
WOULD YOU LIKE FOR THE SAKE OF CLEARNESS TO DISTINGUISH WHICH ARE THE
NECESSARY AND WHICH ARE THE UNNECESSARY PLEASURES
I SHOULD
ARE NOT NECESSARY PLEASURES THOSE OF WHICH WE CANNOT GET RID AND OF
WHICH THE SATISFACTION IS A BENEFIT TO US AND THEY ARE RIGHTLY CALLED
SO BECAUSE WE ARE FRAMED BY NATURE TO DESIRE BOTH WHAT IS BENEFICIAL
AND WHAT IS NECESSARY AND CANNOT HELP IT
TRUE
WE ARE NOT WRONG THEREFORE IN CALLING THEM NECESSARY
WE ARE NOT
AND THE DESIRES OF WHICH A MAN MAY GET RID IF HE TAKES PAINS FROM HIS
YOUTH UPWARDS OF WHICH THE PRESENCE MOREOVER DOES NO GOOD AND IN
SOME CASES THE REVERSE OF GOOD SHALL WE NOT BE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT ALL
THESE ARE UNNECESSARY
YES CERTAINLY
SUPPOSE WE SELECT AN EXAMPLE OF EITHER KIND IN ORDER THAT WE MAY HAVE A
GENERAL NOTION OF THEM
VERY GOOD
WILL NOT THE DESIRE OF EATING THAT IS OF SIMPLE FOOD AND CONDIMENTS
IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE REQUIRED FOR HEALTH AND STRENGTH BE OF THE
NECESSARY CLASS
THAT IS WHAT I SHOULD SUPPOSE
THE PLEASURE OF EATING IS NECESSARY IN TWO WAYS IT DOES US GOOD AND IT
IS ESSENTIAL TO THE CONTINUANCE OF LIFE
YES
BUT THE CONDIMENTS ARE ONLY NECESSARY IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE GOOD FOR
HEALTH
CERTAINLY
AND THE DESIRE WHICH GOES BEYOND THIS OF MORE DELICATE FOOD OR OTHER
LUXURIES WHICH MIGHT GENERALLY BE GOT RID OF IF CONTROLLED AND TRAINED
IN YOUTH AND IS HURTFUL TO THE BODY AND HURTFUL TO THE SOUL IN THE
PURSUIT OF WISDOM AND VIRTUE MAY BE RIGHTLY CALLED UNNECESSARY
VERY TRUE
MAY WE NOT SAY THAT THESE DESIRES SPEND AND THAT THE OTHERS MAKE MONEY
BECAUSE THEY CONDUCE TO PRODUCTION
CERTAINLY
AND OF THE PLEASURES OF LOVE AND ALL OTHER PLEASURES THE SAME HOLDS
GOOD
TRUE
AND THE DRONE OF WHOM WE SPOKE WAS HE WHO WAS SURFEITED IN PLEASURES
AND DESIRES OF THIS SORT AND WAS THE SLAVE OF THE UNNECESSARY DESIRES
WHEREAS HE WHO WAS SUBJECT TO THE NECESSARY ONLY WAS MISERLY AND
OLIGARCHICAL
VERY TRUE
AGAIN LET US SEE HOW THE DEMOCRATICAL MAN GROWS OUT OF THE
OLIGARCHICAL THE FOLLOWING AS I SUSPECT IS COMMONLY THE PROCESS
WHAT IS THE PROCESS
WHEN A YOUNG MAN WHO HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP AS WE WERE JUST NOW DESCRIBING
IN A VULGAR AND MISERLY WAY HAS TASTED DRONES' HONEY AND HAS COME TO
ASSOCIATE WITH FIERCE AND CRAFTY NATURES WHO ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR
HIM ALL SORTS OF REFINEMENTS AND VARIETIES OF PLEASURE THEN AS YOU MAY
IMAGINE THE CHANGE WILL BEGIN OF THE OLIGARCHICAL PRINCIPLE WITHIN HIM
INTO THE DEMOCRATICAL
INEVITABLY
AND AS IN THE CITY LIKE WAS HELPING LIKE AND THE CHANGE WAS EFFECTED BY
AN ALLIANCE FROM WITHOUT ASSISTING ONE DIVISION OF THE CITIZENS SO TOO
THE YOUNG MAN IS CHANGED BY A CLASS OF DESIRES COMING FROM WITHOUT
TO ASSIST THE DESIRES WITHIN HIM THAT WHICH IS AKIN AND ALIKE AGAIN
HELPING THAT WHICH IS AKIN AND ALIKE
CERTAINLY
AND IF THERE BE ANY ALLY WHICH AIDS THE OLIGARCHICAL PRINCIPLE WITHIN
HIM WHETHER THE INFLUENCE OF A FATHER OR OF KINDRED ADVISING OR
REBUKING HIM THEN THERE ARISES IN HIS SOUL A FACTION AND AN OPPOSITE
FACTION AND HE GOES TO WAR WITH HIMSELF
IT MUST BE SO
AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE DEMOCRATICAL PRINCIPLE GIVES WAY TO THE
OLIGARCHICAL AND SOME OF HIS DESIRES DIE AND OTHERS ARE BANISHED
A SPIRIT OF REVERENCE ENTERS INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S SOUL AND ORDER IS
RESTORED
YES HE SAID THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS
AND THEN AGAIN AFTER THE OLD DESIRES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT FRESH ONES
SPRING UP WHICH ARE AKIN TO THEM AND BECAUSE HE THEIR FATHER DOES NOT
KNOW HOW TO EDUCATE THEM WAX FIERCE AND NUMEROUS
YES HE SAID THAT IS APT TO BE THE WAY
THEY DRAW HIM TO HIS OLD ASSOCIATES AND HOLDING SECRET INTERCOURSE WITH
THEM BREED AND MULTIPLY IN HIM
VERY TRUE
AT LENGTH THEY SEIZE UPON THE CITADEL OF THE YOUNG MAN'S SOUL WHICH
THEY PERCEIVE TO BE VOID OF ALL ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND FAIR PURSUITS AND
TRUE WORDS WHICH MAKE THEIR ABODE IN THE MINDS OF MEN WHO ARE DEAR TO
THE GODS AND ARE THEIR BEST GUARDIANS AND SENTINELS
NONE BETTER
FALSE AND BOASTFUL CONCEITS AND PHRASES MOUNT UPWARDS AND TAKE THEIR
PLACE
THEY ARE CERTAIN TO DO SO
AND SO THE YOUNG MAN RETURNS INTO THE COUNTRY OF THE LOTUS EATERS AND
TAKES UP HIS DWELLING THERE IN THE FACE OF ALL MEN AND IF ANY HELP BE
SENT BY HIS FRIENDS TO THE OLIGARCHICAL PART OF HIM THE AFORESAID VAIN
CONCEITS SHUT THE GATE OF THE KING'S FASTNESS AND THEY WILL NEITHER
ALLOW THE EMBASSY ITSELF TO ENTER NOR IF PRIVATE ADVISERS OFFER THE
FATHERLY COUNSEL OF THE AGED WILL THEY LISTEN TO THEM OR RECEIVE THEM
THERE IS A BATTLE AND THEY GAIN THE DAY AND THEN MODESTY WHICH
THEY CALL SILLINESS IS IGNOMINIOUSLY THRUST INTO EXILE BY THEM AND
TEMPERANCE WHICH THEY NICKNAME UNMANLINESS IS TRAMPLED IN THE MIRE AND
CAST FORTH THEY PERSUADE MEN THAT MODERATION AND ORDERLY EXPENDITURE
ARE VULGARITY AND MEANNESS AND SO BY THE HELP OF A RABBLE OF EVIL
APPETITES THEY DRIVE THEM BEYOND THE BORDER
YES WITH A WILL
AND WHEN THEY HAVE EMPTIED AND SWEPT CLEAN THE SOUL OF HIM WHO IS NOW IN
THEIR POWER AND WHO IS BEING INITIATED BY THEM IN GREAT MYSTERIES THE
NEXT THING IS TO BRING BACK TO THEIR HOUSE INSOLENCE AND ANARCHY AND
WASTE AND IMPUDENCE IN BRIGHT ARRAY HAVING GARLANDS ON THEIR HEADS AND
A GREAT COMPANY WITH THEM HYMNING THEIR PRAISES AND CALLING THEM BY
SWEET NAMES INSOLENCE THEY TERM BREEDING AND ANARCHY LIBERTY AND
WASTE MAGNIFICENCE AND IMPUDENCE COURAGE
AND SO THE YOUNG MAN
PASSES OUT OF HIS ORIGINAL NATURE WHICH WAS TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL OF
NECESSITY INTO THE FREEDOM AND LIBERTINISM OF USELESS AND UNNECESSARY
PLEASURES
YES HE SAID THE CHANGE IN HIM IS VISIBLE ENOUGH
AFTER THIS HE LIVES ON SPENDING HIS MONEY AND LABOUR AND TIME ON
UNNECESSARY PLEASURES QUITE AS MUCH AS ON NECESSARY ONES BUT IF HE BE
FORTUNATE AND IS NOT TOO MUCH DISORDERED IN HIS WITS WHEN YEARS HAVE
ELAPSED AND THE HEYDAY OF PASSION IS OVER SUPPOSING THAT HE THEN
RE ADMITS INTO THE CITY SOME PART OF THE EXILED VIRTUES AND DOES NOT
WHOLLY GIVE HIMSELF UP TO THEIR SUCCESSORS IN THAT CASE HE BALANCES HIS
PLEASURES AND LIVES IN A SORT OF EQUILIBRIUM PUTTING THE GOVERNMENT OF
HIMSELF INTO THE HANDS OF THE ONE WHICH COMES FIRST AND WINS THE TURN
AND WHEN HE HAS HAD ENOUGH OF THAT THEN INTO THE HANDS OF ANOTHER HE
DESPISES NONE OF THEM BUT ENCOURAGES THEM ALL EQUALLY
VERY TRUE HE SAID
NEITHER DOES HE RECEIVE OR LET PASS INTO THE FORTRESS ANY TRUE WORD OF
ADVICE IF ANY ONE SAYS TO HIM THAT SOME PLEASURES ARE THE SATISFACTIONS
OF GOOD AND NOBLE DESIRES AND OTHERS OF EVIL DESIRES AND THAT HE OUGHT
TO USE AND HONOUR SOME AND CHASTISE AND MASTER THE OTHERS WHENEVER THIS
IS REPEATED TO HIM HE SHAKES HIS HEAD AND SAYS THAT THEY ARE ALL ALIKE
AND THAT ONE IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE WAY WITH HIM
YES I SAID HE LIVES FROM DAY TO DAY INDULGING THE APPETITE OF THE
HOUR AND SOMETIMES HE IS LAPPED IN DRINK AND STRAINS OF THE FLUTE THEN
HE BECOMES A WATER DRINKER AND TRIES TO GET THIN THEN HE TAKES A TURN
AT GYMNASTICS SOMETIMES IDLING AND NEGLECTING EVERYTHING THEN ONCE
MORE LIVING THE LIFE OF A PHILOSOPHER OFTEN HE IS BUSY WITH POLITICS
AND STARTS TO HIS FEET AND SAYS AND DOES WHATEVER COMES INTO HIS HEAD
AND IF HE IS EMULOUS OF ANY ONE WHO IS A WARRIOR OFF HE IS IN THAT
DIRECTION OR OF MEN OF BUSINESS ONCE MORE IN THAT
HIS LIFE HAS
NEITHER LAW NOR ORDER AND THIS DISTRACTED EXISTENCE HE TERMS JOY AND
BLISS AND FREEDOM AND SO HE GOES ON
YES HE REPLIED HE IS ALL LIBERTY AND EQUALITY
YES I SAID HIS LIFE IS MOTLEY AND MANIFOLD AND AN EPITOME OF THE
LIVES OF MANY HE ANSWERS TO THE STATE WHICH WE DESCRIBED AS FAIR
AND SPANGLED
AND MANY A MAN AND MANY A WOMAN WILL TAKE HIM FOR THEIR
PATTERN AND MANY A CONSTITUTION AND MANY AN EXAMPLE OF MANNERS IS
CONTAINED IN HIM
JUST SO
LET HIM THEN BE SET OVER AGAINST DEMOCRACY HE MAY TRULY BE CALLED THE
DEMOCRATIC MAN
LET THAT BE HIS PLACE HE SAID
LAST OF ALL COMES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL MAN AND STATE ALIKE
TYRANNY AND THE TYRANT THESE WE HAVE NOW TO CONSIDER
QUITE TRUE HE SAID
SAY THEN MY FRIEND IN WHAT MANNER DOES TYRANNY ARISE THAT IT HAS A
DEMOCRATIC ORIGIN IS EVIDENT
CLEARLY
AND DOES NOT TYRANNY SPRING FROM DEMOCRACY IN THE SAME MANNER AS
DEMOCRACY FROM OLIGARCHY I MEAN AFTER A SORT
HOW
THE GOOD WHICH OLIGARCHY PROPOSED TO ITSELF AND THE MEANS BY WHICH IT
WAS MAINTAINED WAS EXCESS OF WEALTH AM I NOT RIGHT
YES
AND THE INSATIABLE DESIRE OF WEALTH AND THE NEGLECT OF ALL OTHER THINGS
FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY GETTING WAS ALSO THE RUIN OF OLIGARCHY
TRUE
AND DEMOCRACY HAS HER OWN GOOD OF WHICH THE INSATIABLE DESIRE BRINGS
HER TO DISSOLUTION
WHAT GOOD
FREEDOM I REPLIED WHICH AS THEY TELL YOU IN A DEMOCRACY IS THE GLORY
OF THE STATE AND THAT THEREFORE IN A DEMOCRACY ALONE WILL THE FREEMAN
OF NATURE DEIGN TO DWELL
YES THE SAYING IS IN EVERY BODY'S MOUTH
I WAS GOING TO OBSERVE THAT THE INSATIABLE DESIRE OF THIS AND THE
NEGLECT OF OTHER THINGS INTRODUCES THE CHANGE IN DEMOCRACY WHICH
OCCASIONS A DEMAND FOR TYRANNY
HOW SO
WHEN A DEMOCRACY WHICH IS THIRSTING FOR FREEDOM HAS EVIL CUP BEARERS
PRESIDING OVER THE FEAST AND HAS DRUNK TOO DEEPLY OF THE STRONG WINE OF
FREEDOM THEN UNLESS HER RULERS ARE VERY AMENABLE AND GIVE A PLENTIFUL
DRAUGHT SHE CALLS THEM TO ACCOUNT AND PUNISHES THEM AND SAYS THAT THEY
ARE CURSED OLIGARCHS
YES HE REPLIED A VERY COMMON OCCURRENCE
YES I SAID AND LOYAL CITIZENS ARE INSULTINGLY TERMED BY HER SLAVES WHO
HUG THEIR CHAINS AND MEN OF NAUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE SUBJECTS WHO ARE LIKE
RULERS AND RULERS WHO ARE LIKE SUBJECTS THESE ARE MEN AFTER HER OWN
HEART WHOM SHE PRAISES AND HONOURS BOTH IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC
NOW IN
SUCH A STATE CAN LIBERTY HAVE ANY LIMIT
CERTAINLY NOT
BY DEGREES THE ANARCHY FINDS A WAY INTO PRIVATE HOUSES AND ENDS BY
GETTING AMONG THE ANIMALS AND INFECTING THEM
HOW DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN THAT THE FATHER GROWS ACCUSTOMED TO DESCEND TO THE LEVEL OF HIS
SONS AND TO FEAR THEM AND THE SON IS ON A LEVEL WITH HIS FATHER HE
HAVING NO RESPECT OR REVERENCE FOR EITHER OF HIS PARENTS AND THIS IS
HIS FREEDOM AND THE METIC IS EQUAL WITH THE CITIZEN AND THE CITIZEN
WITH THE METIC AND THE STRANGER IS QUITE AS GOOD AS EITHER
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE WAY
AND THESE ARE NOT THE ONLY EVILS I SAID THERE ARE SEVERAL LESSER ONES
IN SUCH A STATE OF SOCIETY THE MASTER FEARS AND FLATTERS HIS SCHOLARS
AND THE SCHOLARS DESPISE THEIR MASTERS AND TUTORS YOUNG AND OLD ARE
ALL ALIKE AND THE YOUNG MAN IS ON A LEVEL WITH THE OLD AND IS READY
TO COMPETE WITH HIM IN WORD OR DEED AND OLD MEN CONDESCEND TO THE
YOUNG AND ARE FULL OF PLEASANTRY AND GAIETY THEY ARE LOTH TO BE THOUGHT
MOROSE AND AUTHORITATIVE AND THEREFORE THEY ADOPT THE MANNERS OF THE
YOUNG
QUITE TRUE HE SAID
THE LAST EXTREME OF POPULAR LIBERTY IS WHEN THE SLAVE BOUGHT WITH MONEY
WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE IS JUST AS FREE AS HIS OR HER PURCHASER NOR
MUST I FORGET TO TELL OF THE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY OF THE TWO SEXES IN
RELATION TO EACH OTHER
WHY NOT AS AESCHYLUS SAYS UTTER THE WORD WHICH RISES TO OUR LIPS
THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING I REPLIED AND I MUST ADD THAT NO ONE WHO
DOES NOT KNOW WOULD BELIEVE HOW MUCH GREATER IS THE LIBERTY WHICH THE
ANIMALS WHO ARE UNDER THE DOMINION OF MAN HAVE IN A DEMOCRACY THAN IN
ANY OTHER STATE FOR TRULY THE SHE DOGS AS THE PROVERB SAYS ARE AS
GOOD AS THEIR SHE MISTRESSES AND THE HORSES AND ASSES HAVE A WAY OF
MARCHING ALONG WITH ALL THE RIGHTS AND DIGNITIES OF FREEMEN AND THEY
WILL RUN AT ANY BODY WHO COMES IN THEIR WAY IF HE DOES NOT LEAVE
THE ROAD CLEAR FOR THEM AND ALL THINGS ARE JUST READY TO BURST WITH
LIBERTY
WHEN I TAKE A COUNTRY WALK HE SAID I OFTEN EXPERIENCE WHAT YOU
DESCRIBE
YOU AND I HAVE DREAMED THE SAME THING
AND ABOVE ALL I SAID AND AS THE RESULT OF ALL SEE HOW SENSITIVE THE
CITIZENS BECOME THEY CHAFE IMPATIENTLY AT THE LEAST TOUCH OF AUTHORITY
AND AT LENGTH AS YOU KNOW THEY CEASE TO CARE EVEN FOR THE LAWS
WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN THEY WILL HAVE NO ONE OVER THEM
YES HE SAID I KNOW IT TOO WELL
SUCH MY FRIEND I SAID IS THE FAIR AND GLORIOUS BEGINNING OUT OF WHICH
SPRINGS TYRANNY
GLORIOUS INDEED HE SAID
BUT WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP
THE RUIN OF OLIGARCHY IS THE RUIN OF DEMOCRACY THE SAME DISEASE
MAGNIFIED AND INTENSIFIED BY LIBERTY OVERMASTERS DEMOCRACY THE TRUTH
BEING THAT THE EXCESSIVE INCREASE OF ANYTHING OFTEN CAUSES A REACTION IN
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND THIS IS THE CASE NOT ONLY IN THE SEASONS AND
IN VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL LIFE BUT ABOVE ALL IN FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
TRUE
THE EXCESS OF LIBERTY WHETHER IN STATES OR INDIVIDUALS SEEMS ONLY TO
PASS INTO EXCESS OF SLAVERY
YES THE NATURAL ORDER
AND SO TYRANNY NATURALLY ARISES OUT OF DEMOCRACY AND THE MOST
AGGRAVATED FORM OF TYRANNY AND SLAVERY OUT OF THE MOST EXTREME FORM OF
LIBERTY
AS WE MIGHT EXPECT
THAT HOWEVER WAS NOT AS I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION YOU RATHER DESIRED
TO KNOW WHAT IS THAT DISORDER WHICH IS GENERATED ALIKE IN OLIGARCHY AND
DEMOCRACY AND IS THE RUIN OF BOTH
JUST SO HE REPLIED
WELL I SAID I MEANT TO REFER TO THE CLASS OF IDLE SPENDTHRIFTS
OF WHOM THE MORE COURAGEOUS ARE THE LEADERS AND THE MORE TIMID THE
FOLLOWERS THE SAME WHOM WE WERE COMPARING TO DRONES SOME STINGLESS
AND OTHERS HAVING STINGS
A VERY JUST COMPARISON
THESE TWO CLASSES ARE THE PLAGUES OF EVERY CITY IN WHICH THEY ARE
GENERATED BEING WHAT PHLEGM AND BILE ARE TO THE BODY
AND THE GOOD
PHYSICIAN AND LAWGIVER OF THE STATE OUGHT LIKE THE WISE BEE MASTER TO
KEEP THEM AT A DISTANCE AND PREVENT IF POSSIBLE THEIR EVER COMING IN
AND IF THEY HAVE ANYHOW FOUND A WAY IN THEN HE SHOULD HAVE THEM AND
THEIR CELLS CUT OUT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
YES BY ALL MEANS HE SAID
THEN IN ORDER THAT WE MAY SEE CLEARLY WHAT WE ARE DOING LET US IMAGINE
DEMOCRACY TO BE DIVIDED AS INDEED IT IS INTO THREE CLASSES FOR IN THE
FIRST PLACE FREEDOM CREATES RATHER MORE DRONES IN THE DEMOCRATIC THAN
THERE WERE IN THE OLIGARCHICAL STATE
THAT IS TRUE
AND IN THE DEMOCRACY THEY ARE CERTAINLY MORE INTENSIFIED
HOW SO
BECAUSE IN THE OLIGARCHICAL STATE THEY ARE DISQUALIFIED AND DRIVEN FROM
OFFICE AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT TRAIN OR GATHER STRENGTH WHEREAS IN A
DEMOCRACY THEY ARE ALMOST THE ENTIRE RULING POWER AND WHILE THE KEENER
SORT SPEAK AND ACT THE REST KEEP BUZZING ABOUT THE BEMA AND DO NOT
SUFFER A WORD TO BE SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE HENCE IN DEMOCRACIES ALMOST
EVERYTHING IS MANAGED BY THE DRONES
VERY TRUE HE SAID
THEN THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS WHICH IS ALWAYS BEING SEVERED FROM THE MASS
WHAT IS THAT
THEY ARE THE ORDERLY CLASS WHICH IN A NATION OF TRADERS IS SURE TO BE
THE RICHEST
NATURALLY SO
THEY ARE THE MOST SQUEEZABLE PERSONS AND YIELD THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF
HONEY TO THE DRONES
WHY HE SAID THERE IS LITTLE TO BE SQUEEZED OUT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
LITTLE
AND THIS IS CALLED THE WEALTHY CLASS AND THE DRONES FEED UPON THEM
THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THE CASE HE SAID
THE PEOPLE ARE A THIRD CLASS CONSISTING OF THOSE WHO WORK WITH THEIR
OWN HANDS THEY ARE NOT POLITICIANS AND HAVE NOT MUCH TO LIVE UPON
THIS WHEN ASSEMBLED IS THE LARGEST AND MOST POWERFUL CLASS IN A
DEMOCRACY
TRUE HE SAID BUT THEN THE MULTITUDE IS SELDOM WILLING TO CONGREGATE
UNLESS THEY GET A LITTLE HONEY
AND DO THEY NOT SHARE I SAID
DO NOT THEIR LEADERS DEPRIVE THE RICH
OF THEIR ESTATES AND DISTRIBUTE THEM AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME
TAKING CARE TO RESERVE THE LARGER PART FOR THEMSELVES
WHY YES HE SAID TO THAT EXTENT THE PEOPLE DO SHARE
AND THE PERSONS WHOSE PROPERTY IS TAKEN FROM THEM ARE COMPELLED TO
DEFEND THEMSELVES BEFORE THE PEOPLE AS THEY BEST CAN
WHAT ELSE CAN THEY DO
AND THEN ALTHOUGH THEY MAY HAVE NO DESIRE OF CHANGE THE OTHERS CHARGE
THEM WITH PLOTTING AGAINST THE PEOPLE AND BEING FRIENDS OF OLIGARCHY
TRUE
AND THE END IS THAT WHEN THEY SEE THE PEOPLE NOT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD
BUT THROUGH IGNORANCE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE DECEIVED BY INFORMERS
SEEKING TO DO THEM WRONG THEN AT LAST THEY ARE FORCED TO BECOME
OLIGARCHS IN REALITY THEY DO NOT WISH TO BE BUT THE STING OF THE
DRONES TORMENTS THEM AND BREEDS REVOLUTION IN THEM
THAT IS EXACTLY THE TRUTH
THEN COME IMPEACHMENTS AND JUDGMENTS AND TRIALS OF ONE ANOTHER
TRUE
THE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS SOME CHAMPION WHOM THEY SET OVER THEM AND NURSE
INTO GREATNESS
YES THAT IS THEIR WAY
THIS AND NO OTHER IS THE ROOT FROM WHICH A TYRANT SPRINGS WHEN HE FIRST
APPEARS ABOVE GROUND HE IS A PROTECTOR
YES THAT IS QUITE CLEAR
HOW THEN DOES A PROTECTOR BEGIN TO CHANGE INTO A TYRANT CLEARLY WHEN
HE DOES WHAT THE MAN IS SAID TO DO IN THE TALE OF THE ARCADIAN TEMPLE OF
LYCAEAN ZEUS
WHAT TALE
THE TALE IS THAT HE WHO HAS TASTED THE ENTRAILS OF A SINGLE HUMAN VICTIM
MINCED UP WITH THE ENTRAILS OF OTHER VICTIMS IS DESTINED TO BECOME A
WOLF
DID YOU NEVER HEAR IT
OH YES
AND THE PROTECTOR OF THE PEOPLE IS LIKE HIM HAVING A MOB ENTIRELY AT
HIS DISPOSAL HE IS NOT RESTRAINED FROM SHEDDING THE BLOOD OF KINSMEN
BY THE FAVOURITE METHOD OF FALSE ACCUSATION HE BRINGS THEM INTO COURT
AND MURDERS THEM MAKING THE LIFE OF MAN TO DISAPPEAR AND WITH UNHOLY
TONGUE AND LIPS TASTING THE BLOOD OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS SOME HE KILLS
AND OTHERS HE BANISHES AT THE SAME TIME HINTING AT THE ABOLITION OF
DEBTS AND PARTITION OF LANDS AND AFTER THIS WHAT WILL BE HIS DESTINY
MUST HE NOT EITHER PERISH AT THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES OR FROM BEING A
MAN BECOME A WOLF THAT IS A TYRANT
INEVITABLY
THIS I SAID IS HE WHO BEGINS TO MAKE A PARTY AGAINST THE RICH
THE SAME
AFTER A WHILE HE IS DRIVEN OUT BUT COMES BACK IN SPITE OF HIS ENEMIES
A TYRANT FULL GROWN
THAT IS CLEAR
AND IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO EXPEL HIM OR TO GET HIM CONDEMNED TO DEATH BY
A PUBLIC ACCUSATION THEY CONSPIRE TO ASSASSINATE HIM
YES HE SAID THAT IS THEIR USUAL WAY
THEN COMES THE FAMOUS REQUEST FOR A BODY GUARD WHICH IS THE DEVICE OF
ALL THOSE WHO HAVE GOT THUS FAR IN THEIR TYRANNICAL CAREER 'LET NOT THE
PEOPLE'S FRIEND AS THEY SAY 'BE LOST TO THEM
EXACTLY
THE PEOPLE READILY ASSENT ALL THEIR FEARS ARE FOR HIM THEY HAVE NONE
FOR THEMSELVES
VERY TRUE
AND WHEN A MAN WHO IS WEALTHY AND IS ALSO ACCUSED OF BEING AN ENEMY OF
THE PEOPLE SEES THIS THEN MY FRIEND AS THE ORACLE SAID TO CROESUS
'BY PEBBLY HERMUS' SHORE HE FLEES AND RESTS NOT AND IS NOT ASHAMED TO
BE A COWARD
AND QUITE RIGHT TOO SAID HE FOR IF HE WERE HE WOULD NEVER BE ASHAMED
AGAIN
BUT IF HE IS CAUGHT HE DIES
OF COURSE
AND HE THE PROTECTOR OF WHOM WE SPOKE IS TO BE SEEN NOT 'LARDING THE
PLAIN' WITH HIS BULK BUT HIMSELF THE OVERTHROWER OF MANY STANDING UP
IN THE CHARIOT OF STATE WITH THE REINS IN HIS HAND NO LONGER PROTECTOR
BUT TYRANT ABSOLUTE
NO DOUBT HE SAID
AND NOW LET US CONSIDER THE HAPPINESS OF THE MAN AND ALSO OF THE STATE
IN WHICH A CREATURE LIKE HIM IS GENERATED
YES HE SAID LET US CONSIDER THAT
AT FIRST IN THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS POWER HE IS FULL OF SMILES AND
HE SALUTES EVERY ONE WHOM HE MEETS HE TO BE CALLED A TYRANT WHO IS
MAKING PROMISES IN PUBLIC AND ALSO IN PRIVATE LIBERATING DEBTORS AND
DISTRIBUTING LAND TO THE PEOPLE AND HIS FOLLOWERS AND WANTING TO BE SO
KIND AND GOOD TO EVERY ONE
OF COURSE HE SAID
BUT WHEN HE HAS DISPOSED OF FOREIGN ENEMIES BY CONQUEST OR TREATY AND
THERE IS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THEM THEN HE IS ALWAYS STIRRING UP SOME
WAR OR OTHER IN ORDER THAT THE PEOPLE MAY REQUIRE A LEADER
TO BE SURE
HAS HE NOT ALSO ANOTHER OBJECT WHICH IS THAT THEY MAY BE IMPOVERISHED
BY PAYMENT OF TAXES AND THUS COMPELLED TO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THEIR
DAILY WANTS AND THEREFORE LESS LIKELY TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM
CLEARLY
AND IF ANY OF THEM ARE SUSPECTED BY HIM OF HAVING NOTIONS OF FREEDOM
AND OF RESISTANCE TO HIS AUTHORITY HE WILL HAVE A GOOD PRETEXT FOR
DESTROYING THEM BY PLACING THEM AT THE MERCY OF THE ENEMY AND FOR ALL
THESE REASONS THE TYRANT MUST BE ALWAYS GETTING UP A WAR
HE MUST
NOW HE BEGINS TO GROW UNPOPULAR
A NECESSARY RESULT
THEN SOME OF THOSE WHO JOINED IN SETTING HIM UP AND WHO ARE IN POWER
SPEAK THEIR MINDS TO HIM AND TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE MORE COURAGEOUS OF
THEM CAST IN HIS TEETH WHAT IS BEING DONE
YES THAT MAY BE EXPECTED
AND THE TYRANT IF HE MEANS TO RULE MUST GET RID OF THEM HE CANNOT
STOP WHILE HE HAS A FRIEND OR AN ENEMY WHO IS GOOD FOR ANYTHING
HE CANNOT
AND THEREFORE HE MUST LOOK ABOUT HIM AND SEE WHO IS VALIANT WHO IS
HIGH MINDED WHO IS WISE WHO IS WEALTHY HAPPY MAN HE IS THE ENEMY
OF THEM ALL AND MUST SEEK OCCASION AGAINST THEM WHETHER HE WILL OR NO
UNTIL HE HAS MADE A PURGATION OF THE STATE
YES HE SAID AND A RARE PURGATION
YES I SAID NOT THE SORT OF PURGATION WHICH THE PHYSICIANS MAKE OF THE
BODY FOR THEY TAKE AWAY THE WORSE AND LEAVE THE BETTER PART BUT HE
DOES THE REVERSE
IF HE IS TO RULE I SUPPOSE THAT HE CANNOT HELP HIMSELF
WHAT A BLESSED ALTERNATIVE I SAID TO BE COMPELLED TO DWELL ONLY WITH
THE MANY BAD AND TO BE BY THEM HATED OR NOT TO LIVE AT ALL
YES THAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE
AND THE MORE DETESTABLE HIS ACTIONS ARE TO THE CITIZENS THE MORE
SATELLITES AND THE GREATER DEVOTION IN THEM WILL HE REQUIRE
CERTAINLY
AND WHO ARE THE DEVOTED BAND AND WHERE WILL HE PROCURE THEM
THEY WILL FLOCK TO HIM HE SAID OF THEIR OWN ACCORD IF HE PAYS THEM
BY THE DOG I SAID HERE ARE MORE DRONES OF EVERY SORT AND FROM EVERY
LAND
YES HE SAID THERE ARE
BUT WILL HE NOT DESIRE TO GET THEM ON THE SPOT
HOW DO YOU MEAN
HE WILL ROB THE CITIZENS OF THEIR SLAVES HE WILL THEN SET THEM FREE AND
ENROL THEM IN HIS BODY GUARD
TO BE SURE HE SAID AND HE WILL BE ABLE TO TRUST THEM BEST OF ALL
WHAT A BLESSED CREATURE I SAID MUST THIS TYRANT BE HE HAS PUT TO
DEATH THE OTHERS AND HAS THESE FOR HIS TRUSTED FRIENDS
YES HE SAID THEY ARE QUITE OF HIS SORT
YES I SAID AND THESE ARE THE NEW CITIZENS WHOM HE HAS CALLED INTO
EXISTENCE WHO ADMIRE HIM AND ARE HIS COMPANIONS WHILE THE GOOD HATE
AND AVOID HIM
OF COURSE
VERILY THEN TRAGEDY IS A WISE THING AND EURIPIDES A GREAT TRAGEDIAN
WHY SO
WHY BECAUSE HE IS THE AUTHOR OF THE PREGNANT SAYING
'TYRANTS ARE WISE BY LIVING WITH THE WISE
AND HE CLEARLY MEANT TO SAY THAT THEY ARE THE WISE WHOM THE TYRANT MAKES
HIS COMPANIONS
YES HE SAID AND HE ALSO PRAISES TYRANNY AS GODLIKE AND MANY OTHER
THINGS OF THE SAME KIND ARE SAID BY HIM AND BY THE OTHER POETS
AND THEREFORE I SAID THE TRAGIC POETS BEING WISE MEN WILL FORGIVE US
AND ANY OTHERS WHO LIVE AFTER OUR MANNER IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE THEM INTO
OUR STATE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE EULOGISTS OF TYRANNY
YES HE SAID THOSE WHO HAVE THE WIT WILL DOUBTLESS FORGIVE US
BUT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO OTHER CITIES AND ATTRACT MOBS AND
HIRE VOICES FAIR AND LOUD AND PERSUASIVE AND DRAW THE CITIES OVER TO
TYRANNIES AND DEMOCRACIES
VERY TRUE
MOREOVER THEY ARE PAID FOR THIS AND RECEIVE HONOUR THE GREATEST
HONOUR AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM TYRANTS AND THE NEXT GREATEST FROM
DEMOCRACIES BUT THE HIGHER THEY ASCEND OUR CONSTITUTION HILL THE MORE
THEIR REPUTATION FAILS AND SEEMS UNABLE FROM SHORTNESS OF BREATH TO
PROCEED FURTHER
TRUE
BUT WE ARE WANDERING FROM THE SUBJECT LET US THEREFORE RETURN AND
ENQUIRE HOW THE TYRANT WILL MAINTAIN THAT FAIR AND NUMEROUS AND VARIOUS
AND EVER CHANGING ARMY OF HIS
IF HE SAID THERE ARE SACRED TREASURES IN THE CITY HE WILL CONFISCATE
AND SPEND THEM AND IN SO FAR AS THE FORTUNES OF ATTAINTED PERSONS MAY
SUFFICE HE WILL BE ABLE TO DIMINISH THE TAXES WHICH HE WOULD OTHERWISE
HAVE TO IMPOSE UPON THE PEOPLE
AND WHEN THESE FAIL
WHY CLEARLY HE SAID THEN HE AND HIS BOON COMPANIONS WHETHER MALE OR
FEMALE WILL BE MAINTAINED OUT OF HIS FATHER'S ESTATE
YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM HE HAS DERIVED HIS BEING
WILL MAINTAIN HIM AND HIS COMPANIONS
YES HE SAID THEY CANNOT HELP THEMSELVES
BUT WHAT IF THE PEOPLE FLY INTO A PASSION AND AVER THAT A GROWN UP SON
OUGHT NOT TO BE SUPPORTED BY HIS FATHER BUT THAT THE FATHER SHOULD BE
SUPPORTED BY THE SON THE FATHER DID NOT BRING HIM INTO BEING OR SETTLE
HIM IN LIFE IN ORDER THAT WHEN HIS SON BECAME A MAN HE SHOULD HIMSELF
BE THE SERVANT OF HIS OWN SERVANTS AND SHOULD SUPPORT HIM AND HIS RABBLE
OF SLAVES AND COMPANIONS BUT THAT HIS SON SHOULD PROTECT HIM AND THAT
BY HIS HELP HE MIGHT BE EMANCIPATED FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RICH AND
ARISTOCRATIC AS THEY ARE TERMED
AND SO HE BIDS HIM AND HIS COMPANIONS
DEPART JUST AS ANY OTHER FATHER MIGHT DRIVE OUT OF THE HOUSE A RIOTOUS
SON AND HIS UNDESIRABLE ASSOCIATES
BY HEAVEN HE SAID THEN THE PARENT WILL DISCOVER WHAT A MONSTER HE HAS
BEEN FOSTERING IN HIS BOSOM AND WHEN HE WANTS TO DRIVE HIM OUT HE
WILL FIND THAT HE IS WEAK AND HIS SON STRONG
WHY YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE TYRANT WILL USE VIOLENCE WHAT
BEAT HIS FATHER IF HE OPPOSES HIM
YES HE WILL HAVING FIRST DISARMED HIM
THEN HE IS A PARRICIDE AND A CRUEL GUARDIAN OF AN AGED PARENT AND THIS
IS REAL TYRANNY ABOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A MISTAKE AS THE
SAYING IS THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD ESCAPE THE SMOKE WHICH IS THE SLAVERY OF
FREEMEN HAS FALLEN INTO THE FIRE WHICH IS THE TYRANNY OF SLAVES
THUS
LIBERTY GETTING OUT OF ALL ORDER AND REASON PASSES INTO THE HARSHEST
AND BITTEREST FORM OF SLAVERY
TRUE HE SAID
VERY WELL AND MAY WE NOT RIGHTLY SAY THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENTLY
DISCUSSED THE NATURE OF TYRANNY AND THE MANNER OF THE TRANSITION FROM
DEMOCRACY TO TYRANNY
YES QUITE ENOUGH HE SAID
BOOK IX
LAST OF ALL COMES THE TYRANNICAL MAN ABOUT WHOM WE HAVE ONCE MORE TO
ASK HOW IS HE FORMED OUT OF THE DEMOCRATICAL AND HOW DOES HE LIVE IN
HAPPINESS OR IN MISERY
YES HE SAID HE IS THE ONLY ONE REMAINING
THERE IS HOWEVER I SAID A PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH REMAINS UNANSWERED
WHAT QUESTION
I DO NOT THINK THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY DETERMINED THE NATURE AND NUMBER
OF THE APPETITES AND UNTIL THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THE ENQUIRY WILL ALWAYS
BE CONFUSED
WELL HE SAID IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO SUPPLY THE OMISSION
VERY TRUE I SAID AND OBSERVE THE POINT WHICH I WANT TO UNDERSTAND
CERTAIN OF THE UNNECESSARY PLEASURES AND APPETITES I CONCEIVE TO BE
UNLAWFUL EVERY ONE APPEARS TO HAVE THEM BUT IN SOME PERSONS THEY ARE
CONTROLLED BY THE LAWS AND BY REASON AND THE BETTER DESIRES PREVAIL
OVER THEM EITHER THEY ARE WHOLLY BANISHED OR THEY BECOME FEW AND WEAK
WHILE IN THE CASE OF OTHERS THEY ARE STRONGER AND THERE ARE MORE OF
THEM
WHICH APPETITES DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN THOSE WHICH ARE AWAKE WHEN THE REASONING AND HUMAN AND RULING
POWER IS ASLEEP THEN THE WILD BEAST WITHIN US GORGED WITH MEAT OR
DRINK STARTS UP AND HAVING SHAKEN OFF SLEEP GOES FORTH TO SATISFY
HIS DESIRES AND THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE FOLLY OR CRIME NOT EXCEPTING
INCEST OR ANY OTHER UNNATURAL UNION OR PARRICIDE OR THE EATING OF
FORBIDDEN FOOD WHICH AT SUCH A TIME WHEN HE HAS PARTED COMPANY WITH
ALL SHAME AND SENSE A MAN MAY NOT BE READY TO COMMIT
MOST TRUE HE SAID
BUT WHEN A MAN'S PULSE IS HEALTHY AND TEMPERATE AND WHEN BEFORE GOING
TO SLEEP HE HAS AWAKENED HIS RATIONAL POWERS AND FED THEM ON NOBLE
THOUGHTS AND ENQUIRIES COLLECTING HIMSELF IN MEDITATION AFTER HAVING
FIRST INDULGED HIS APPETITES NEITHER TOO MUCH NOR TOO LITTLE BUT JUST
ENOUGH TO LAY THEM TO SLEEP AND PREVENT THEM AND THEIR ENJOYMENTS AND
PAINS FROM INTERFERING WITH THE HIGHER PRINCIPLE WHICH HE LEAVES IN
THE SOLITUDE OF PURE ABSTRACTION FREE TO CONTEMPLATE AND ASPIRE TO
THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNKNOWN WHETHER IN PAST PRESENT OR FUTURE WHEN
AGAIN HE HAS ALLAYED THE PASSIONATE ELEMENT IF HE HAS A QUARREL AGAINST
ANY ONE I SAY WHEN AFTER PACIFYING THE TWO IRRATIONAL PRINCIPLES HE
ROUSES UP THE THIRD WHICH IS REASON BEFORE HE TAKES HIS REST THEN
AS YOU KNOW HE ATTAINS TRUTH MOST NEARLY AND IS LEAST LIKELY TO BE THE
SPORT OF FANTASTIC AND LAWLESS VISIONS
I QUITE AGREE
IN SAYING THIS I HAVE BEEN RUNNING INTO A DIGRESSION BUT THE POINT
WHICH I DESIRE TO NOTE IS THAT IN ALL OF US EVEN IN GOOD MEN THERE IS
A LAWLESS WILD BEAST NATURE WHICH PEERS OUT IN SLEEP
PRAY CONSIDER
WHETHER I AM RIGHT AND YOU AGREE WITH ME
YES I AGREE
AND NOW REMEMBER THE CHARACTER WHICH WE ATTRIBUTED TO THE DEMOCRATIC
MAN
HE WAS SUPPOSED FROM HIS YOUTH UPWARDS TO HAVE BEEN TRAINED UNDER
A MISERLY PARENT WHO ENCOURAGED THE SAVING APPETITES IN HIM BUT
DISCOUNTENANCED THE UNNECESSARY WHICH AIM ONLY AT AMUSEMENT AND
ORNAMENT
TRUE
AND THEN HE GOT INTO THE COMPANY OF A MORE REFINED LICENTIOUS SORT OF
PEOPLE AND TAKING TO ALL THEIR WANTON WAYS RUSHED INTO THE OPPOSITE
EXTREME FROM AN ABHORRENCE OF HIS FATHER'S MEANNESS
AT LAST BEING A
BETTER MAN THAN HIS CORRUPTORS HE WAS DRAWN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS UNTIL HE
HALTED MIDWAY AND LED A LIFE NOT OF VULGAR AND SLAVISH PASSION BUT
OF WHAT HE DEEMED MODERATE INDULGENCE IN VARIOUS PLEASURES
AFTER THIS
MANNER THE DEMOCRAT WAS GENERATED OUT OF THE OLIGARCH
YES HE SAID THAT WAS OUR VIEW OF HIM AND IS SO STILL
AND NOW I SAID YEARS WILL HAVE PASSED AWAY AND YOU MUST CONCEIVE THIS
MAN SUCH AS HE IS TO HAVE A SON WHO IS BROUGHT UP IN HIS FATHER'S
PRINCIPLES
I CAN IMAGINE HIM
THEN YOU MUST FURTHER IMAGINE THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN TO THE SON
WHICH HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO THE FATHER HE IS DRAWN INTO A PERFECTLY
LAWLESS LIFE WHICH BY HIS SEDUCERS IS TERMED PERFECT LIBERTY AND HIS
FATHER AND FRIENDS TAKE PART WITH HIS MODERATE DESIRES AND THE OPPOSITE
PARTY ASSIST THE OPPOSITE ONES
AS SOON AS THESE DIRE MAGICIANS AND
TYRANT MAKERS FIND THAT THEY ARE LOSING THEIR HOLD ON HIM THEY CONTRIVE
TO IMPLANT IN HIM A MASTER PASSION TO BE LORD OVER HIS IDLE AND
SPENDTHRIFT LUSTS A SORT OF MONSTROUS WINGED DRONE THAT IS THE ONLY
IMAGE WHICH WILL ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE HIM
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE ONLY ADEQUATE IMAGE OF HIM
AND WHEN HIS OTHER LUSTS AMID CLOUDS OF INCENSE AND PERFUMES AND
GARLANDS AND WINES AND ALL THE PLEASURES OF A DISSOLUTE LIFE NOW LET
LOOSE COME BUZZING AROUND HIM NOURISHING TO THE UTMOST THE STING OF
DESIRE WHICH THEY IMPLANT IN HIS DRONE LIKE NATURE THEN AT LAST THIS
LORD OF THE SOUL HAVING MADNESS FOR THE CAPTAIN OF HIS GUARD BREAKS
OUT INTO A FRENZY AND IF HE FINDS IN HIMSELF ANY GOOD OPINIONS OR
APPETITES IN PROCESS OF FORMATION AND THERE IS IN HIM ANY SENSE OF
SHAME REMAINING TO THESE BETTER PRINCIPLES HE PUTS AN END AND CASTS
THEM FORTH UNTIL HE HAS PURGED AWAY TEMPERANCE AND BROUGHT IN MADNESS TO
THE FULL
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH THE TYRANNICAL MAN IS GENERATED
AND IS NOT THIS THE REASON WHY OF OLD LOVE HAS BEEN CALLED A TYRANT
I SHOULD NOT WONDER
FURTHER I SAID HAS NOT A DRUNKEN MAN ALSO THE SPIRIT OF A TYRANT
HE HAS
AND YOU KNOW THAT A MAN WHO IS DERANGED AND NOT RIGHT IN HIS MIND WILL
FANCY THAT HE IS ABLE TO RULE NOT ONLY OVER MEN BUT ALSO OVER THE
GODS
THAT HE WILL
AND THE TYRANNICAL MAN IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD COMES INTO BEING
WHEN EITHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NATURE OR HABIT OR BOTH HE
BECOMES DRUNKEN LUSTFUL PASSIONATE O MY FRIEND IS NOT THAT SO
ASSUREDLY
SUCH IS THE MAN AND SUCH IS HIS ORIGIN
AND NEXT HOW DOES HE LIVE
SUPPOSE AS PEOPLE FACETIOUSLY SAY YOU WERE TO TELL ME
I IMAGINE I SAID AT THE NEXT STEP IN HIS PROGRESS THAT THERE WILL BE
FEASTS AND CAROUSALS AND REVELLINGS AND COURTEZANS AND ALL THAT SORT
OF THING LOVE IS THE LORD OF THE HOUSE WITHIN HIM AND ORDERS ALL THE
CONCERNS OF HIS SOUL
THAT IS CERTAIN
YES AND EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT DESIRES GROW UP MANY AND FORMIDABLE
AND THEIR DEMANDS ARE MANY
THEY ARE INDEED HE SAID
HIS REVENUES IF HE HAS ANY ARE SOON SPENT
TRUE
THEN COMES DEBT AND THE CUTTING DOWN OF HIS PROPERTY
OF COURSE
WHEN HE HAS NOTHING LEFT MUST NOT HIS DESIRES CROWDING IN THE NEST
LIKE YOUNG RAVENS BE CRYING ALOUD FOR FOOD AND HE GOADED ON BY THEM
AND ESPECIALLY BY LOVE HIMSELF WHO IS IN A MANNER THE CAPTAIN OF THEM
IS IN A FRENZY AND WOULD FAIN DISCOVER WHOM HE CAN DEFRAUD OR DESPOIL
OF HIS PROPERTY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY GRATIFY THEM
YES THAT IS SURE TO BE THE CASE
HE MUST HAVE MONEY NO MATTER HOW IF HE IS TO ESCAPE HORRID PAINS AND
PANGS
HE MUST
AND AS IN HIMSELF THERE WAS A SUCCESSION OF PLEASURES AND THE NEW GOT
THE BETTER OF THE OLD AND TOOK AWAY THEIR RIGHTS SO HE BEING YOUNGER
WILL CLAIM TO HAVE MORE THAN HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER AND IF HE HAS
SPENT HIS OWN SHARE OF THE PROPERTY HE WILL TAKE A SLICE OF THEIRS
NO DOUBT HE WILL
AND IF HIS PARENTS WILL NOT GIVE WAY THEN HE WILL TRY FIRST OF ALL TO
CHEAT AND DECEIVE THEM
VERY TRUE
AND IF HE FAILS THEN HE WILL USE FORCE AND PLUNDER THEM
YES PROBABLY
AND IF THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN WHAT THEN MY FRIEND
WILL THE CREATURE FEEL ANY COMPUNCTION AT TYRANNIZING OVER THEM
NAY HE SAID I SHOULD NOT FEEL AT ALL COMFORTABLE ABOUT HIS PARENTS
BUT O HEAVENS ADEIMANTUS ON ACCOUNT OF SOME NEW FANGLED LOVE OF A
HARLOT WHO IS ANYTHING BUT A NECESSARY CONNECTION CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT
HE WOULD STRIKE THE MOTHER WHO IS HIS ANCIENT FRIEND AND NECESSARY
TO HIS VERY EXISTENCE AND WOULD PLACE HER UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE
OTHER WHEN SHE IS BROUGHT UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HER OR THAT UNDER
LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES HE WOULD DO THE SAME TO HIS WITHERED OLD FATHER
FIRST AND MOST INDISPENSABLE OF FRIENDS FOR THE SAKE OF SOME
NEWLY FOUND BLOOMING YOUTH WHO IS THE REVERSE OF INDISPENSABLE
YES INDEED HE SAID I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD
TRULY THEN I SAID A TYRANNICAL SON IS A BLESSING TO HIS FATHER AND
MOTHER
HE IS INDEED HE REPLIED
HE FIRST TAKES THEIR PROPERTY AND WHEN THAT FAILS AND PLEASURES ARE
BEGINNING TO SWARM IN THE HIVE OF HIS SOUL THEN HE BREAKS INTO A HOUSE
OR STEALS THE GARMENTS OF SOME NIGHTLY WAYFARER NEXT HE PROCEEDS TO
CLEAR A TEMPLE
MEANWHILE THE OLD OPINIONS WHICH HE HAD WHEN A CHILD
AND WHICH GAVE JUDGMENT ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL ARE OVERTHROWN BY THOSE
OTHERS WHICH HAVE JUST BEEN EMANCIPATED AND ARE NOW THE BODY GUARD OF
LOVE AND SHARE HIS EMPIRE
THESE IN HIS DEMOCRATIC DAYS WHEN HE WAS
STILL SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND TO HIS FATHER WERE ONLY LET LOOSE IN
THE DREAMS OF SLEEP
BUT NOW THAT HE IS UNDER THE DOMINION OF LOVE HE
BECOMES ALWAYS AND IN WAKING REALITY WHAT HE WAS THEN VERY RARELY AND IN
A DREAM ONLY HE WILL COMMIT THE FOULEST MURDER OR EAT FORBIDDEN FOOD
OR BE GUILTY OF ANY OTHER HORRID ACT
LOVE IS HIS TYRANT AND LIVES
LORDLY IN HIM AND LAWLESSLY AND BEING HIMSELF A KING LEADS HIM ON AS
A TYRANT LEADS A STATE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY RECKLESS DEED BY WHICH
HE CAN MAINTAIN HIMSELF AND THE RABBLE OF HIS ASSOCIATES WHETHER THOSE
WHOM EVIL COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BROUGHT IN FROM WITHOUT OR THOSE WHOM
HE HIMSELF HAS ALLOWED TO BREAK LOOSE WITHIN HIM BY REASON OF A SIMILAR
EVIL NATURE IN HIMSELF
HAVE WE NOT HERE A PICTURE OF HIS WAY OF LIFE
YES INDEED HE SAID
AND IF THERE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THEM IN THE STATE AND THE REST OF THE
PEOPLE ARE WELL DISPOSED THEY GO AWAY AND BECOME THE BODY GUARD OR
MERCENARY SOLDIERS OF SOME OTHER TYRANT WHO MAY PROBABLY WANT THEM FOR A
WAR AND IF THERE IS NO WAR THEY STAY AT HOME AND DO MANY LITTLE PIECES
OF MISCHIEF IN THE CITY
WHAT SORT OF MISCHIEF
FOR EXAMPLE THEY ARE THE THIEVES BURGLARS CUT PURSES FOOT PADS
ROBBERS OF TEMPLES MAN STEALERS OF THE COMMUNITY OR IF THEY ARE ABLE
TO SPEAK THEY TURN INFORMERS AND BEAR FALSE WITNESS AND TAKE BRIBES
A SMALL CATALOGUE OF EVILS EVEN IF THE PERPETRATORS OF THEM ARE FEW IN
NUMBER
YES I SAID BUT SMALL AND GREAT ARE COMPARATIVE TERMS AND ALL THESE
THINGS IN THE MISERY AND EVIL WHICH THEY INFLICT UPON A STATE DO NOT
COME WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES OF THE TYRANT WHEN THIS NOXIOUS CLASS AND
THEIR FOLLOWERS GROW NUMEROUS AND BECOME CONSCIOUS OF THEIR STRENGTH
ASSISTED BY THE INFATUATION OF THE PEOPLE THEY CHOOSE FROM AMONG
THEMSELVES THE ONE WHO HAS MOST OF THE TYRANT IN HIS OWN SOUL AND HIM
THEY CREATE THEIR TYRANT
YES HE SAID AND HE WILL BE THE MOST FIT TO BE A TYRANT
IF THE PEOPLE YIELD WELL AND GOOD BUT IF THEY RESIST HIM AS HE BEGAN
BY BEATING HIS OWN FATHER AND MOTHER SO NOW IF HE HAS THE POWER HE
BEATS THEM AND WILL KEEP HIS DEAR OLD FATHERLAND OR MOTHERLAND AS THE
CRETANS SAY IN SUBJECTION TO HIS YOUNG RETAINERS WHOM HE HAS INTRODUCED
TO BE THEIR RULERS AND MASTERS
THIS IS THE END OF HIS PASSIONS AND
DESIRES
EXACTLY
WHEN SUCH MEN ARE ONLY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS AND BEFORE THEY GET POWER
THIS IS THEIR CHARACTER THEY ASSOCIATE ENTIRELY WITH THEIR OWN
FLATTERERS OR READY TOOLS OR IF THEY WANT ANYTHING FROM ANYBODY THEY
IN THEIR TURN ARE EQUALLY READY TO BOW DOWN BEFORE THEM THEY PROFESS
EVERY SORT OF AFFECTION FOR THEM BUT WHEN THEY HAVE GAINED THEIR POINT
THEY KNOW THEM NO MORE
YES TRULY
THEY ARE ALWAYS EITHER THE MASTERS OR SERVANTS AND NEVER THE FRIENDS OF
ANYBODY THE TYRANT NEVER TASTES OF TRUE FREEDOM OR FRIENDSHIP
CERTAINLY NOT
AND MAY WE NOT RIGHTLY CALL SUCH MEN TREACHEROUS
NO QUESTION
ALSO THEY ARE UTTERLY UNJUST IF WE WERE RIGHT IN OUR NOTION OF JUSTICE
YES HE SAID AND WE WERE PERFECTLY RIGHT
LET US THEN SUM UP IN A WORD I SAID THE CHARACTER OF THE WORST MAN HE
IS THE WAKING REALITY OF WHAT WE DREAMED
MOST TRUE
AND THIS IS HE WHO BEING BY NATURE MOST OF A TYRANT BEARS RULE AND THE
LONGER HE LIVES THE MORE OF A TYRANT HE BECOMES
THAT IS CERTAIN SAID GLAUCON TAKING HIS TURN TO ANSWER
AND WILL NOT HE WHO HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE WICKEDEST BE ALSO THE MOST
MISERABLE AND HE WHO HAS TYRANNIZED LONGEST AND MOST MOST CONTINUALLY
AND TRULY MISERABLE ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE THE OPINION OF MEN IN
GENERAL
YES HE SAID INEVITABLY
AND MUST NOT THE TYRANNICAL MAN BE LIKE THE TYRANNICAL STATE AND
THE DEMOCRATICAL MAN LIKE THE DEMOCRATICAL STATE AND THE SAME OF THE
OTHERS
CERTAINLY
AND AS STATE IS TO STATE IN VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS SO IS MAN IN RELATION
TO MAN
TO BE SURE
THEN COMPARING OUR ORIGINAL CITY WHICH WAS UNDER A KING AND THE CITY
WHICH IS UNDER A TYRANT HOW DO THEY STAND AS TO VIRTUE
THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE EXTREMES HE SAID FOR ONE IS THE VERY BEST AND
THE OTHER IS THE VERY WORST
THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE I SAID AS TO WHICH IS WHICH AND THEREFORE
I WILL AT ONCE ENQUIRE WHETHER YOU WOULD ARRIVE AT A SIMILAR DECISION
ABOUT THEIR RELATIVE HAPPINESS AND MISERY
AND HERE WE MUST NOT ALLOW
OURSELVES TO BE PANIC STRICKEN AT THE APPARITION OF THE TYRANT WHO IS
ONLY A UNIT AND MAY PERHAPS HAVE A FEW RETAINERS ABOUT HIM BUT LET US
GO AS WE OUGHT INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE CITY AND LOOK ALL ABOUT AND
THEN WE WILL GIVE OUR OPINION
A FAIR INVITATION HE REPLIED AND I SEE AS EVERY ONE MUST THAT A
TYRANNY IS THE WRETCHEDEST FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND THE RULE OF A KING
THE HAPPIEST
AND IN ESTIMATING THE MEN TOO MAY I NOT FAIRLY MAKE A LIKE REQUEST
THAT I SHOULD HAVE A JUDGE WHOSE MIND CAN ENTER INTO AND SEE THROUGH
HUMAN NATURE HE MUST NOT BE LIKE A CHILD WHO LOOKS AT THE OUTSIDE AND
IS DAZZLED AT THE POMPOUS ASPECT WHICH THE TYRANNICAL NATURE ASSUMES TO
THE BEHOLDER BUT LET HIM BE ONE WHO HAS A CLEAR INSIGHT
MAY I SUPPOSE
THAT THE JUDGMENT IS GIVEN IN THE HEARING OF US ALL BY ONE WHO IS ABLE
TO JUDGE AND HAS DWELT IN THE SAME PLACE WITH HIM AND BEEN PRESENT AT
HIS DALLY LIFE AND KNOWN HIM IN HIS FAMILY RELATIONS WHERE HE MAY BE
SEEN STRIPPED OF HIS TRAGEDY ATTIRE AND AGAIN IN THE HOUR OF PUBLIC
DANGER HE SHALL TELL US ABOUT THE HAPPINESS AND MISERY OF THE TYRANT
WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER MEN
THAT AGAIN HE SAID IS A VERY FAIR PROPOSAL
SHALL I ASSUME THAT WE OURSELVES ARE ABLE AND EXPERIENCED JUDGES AND
HAVE BEFORE NOW MET WITH SUCH A PERSON WE SHALL THEN HAVE SOME ONE WHO
WILL ANSWER OUR ENQUIRIES
BY ALL MEANS
LET ME ASK YOU NOT TO FORGET THE PARALLEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE
STATE BEARING THIS IN MIND AND GLANCING IN TURN FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
OF THEM WILL YOU TELL ME THEIR RESPECTIVE CONDITIONS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE ASKED
BEGINNING WITH THE STATE I REPLIED WOULD YOU SAY THAT A CITY WHICH IS
GOVERNED BY A TYRANT IS FREE OR ENSLAVED
NO CITY HE SAID CAN BE MORE COMPLETELY ENSLAVED
AND YET AS YOU SEE THERE ARE FREEMEN AS WELL AS MASTERS IN SUCH A
STATE
YES HE SAID I SEE THAT THERE ARE A FEW BUT THE PEOPLE SPEAKING
GENERALLY AND THE BEST OF THEM ARE MISERABLY DEGRADED AND ENSLAVED
THEN IF THE MAN IS LIKE THE STATE I SAID MUST NOT THE SAME RULE
PREVAIL HIS SOUL IS FULL OF MEANNESS AND VULGARITY THE BEST ELEMENTS
IN HIM ARE ENSLAVED AND THERE IS A SMALL RULING PART WHICH IS ALSO THE
WORST AND MADDEST
INEVITABLY
AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE SOUL OF SUCH AN ONE IS THE SOUL OF A FREEMAN
OR OF A SLAVE
HE HAS THE SOUL OF A SLAVE IN MY OPINION
AND THE STATE WHICH IS ENSLAVED UNDER A TYRANT IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF
ACTING VOLUNTARILY
UTTERLY INCAPABLE
AND ALSO THE SOUL WHICH IS UNDER A TYRANT I AM SPEAKING OF THE SOUL
TAKEN AS A WHOLE IS LEAST CAPABLE OF DOING WHAT SHE DESIRES THERE IS A
GADFLY WHICH GOADS HER AND SHE IS FULL OF TROUBLE AND REMORSE
CERTAINLY
AND IS THE CITY WHICH IS UNDER A TYRANT RICH OR POOR
POOR
AND THE TYRANNICAL SOUL MUST BE ALWAYS POOR AND INSATIABLE
TRUE
AND MUST NOT SUCH A STATE AND SUCH A MAN BE ALWAYS FULL OF FEAR
YES INDEED
IS THERE ANY STATE IN WHICH YOU WILL FIND MORE OF LAMENTATION AND SORROW
AND GROANING AND PAIN
CERTAINLY NOT
AND IS THERE ANY MAN IN WHOM YOU WILL FIND MORE OF THIS SORT OF MISERY
THAN IN THE TYRANNICAL MAN WHO IS IN A FURY OF PASSIONS AND DESIRES
IMPOSSIBLE
REFLECTING UPON THESE AND SIMILAR EVILS YOU HELD THE TYRANNICAL STATE
TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE OF STATES
AND I WAS RIGHT HE SAID
CERTAINLY I SAID
AND WHEN YOU SEE THE SAME EVILS IN THE TYRANNICAL
MAN WHAT DO YOU SAY OF HIM
I SAY THAT HE IS BY FAR THE MOST MISERABLE OF ALL MEN
THERE I SAID I THINK THAT YOU ARE BEGINNING TO GO WRONG
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS AS YET REACHED THE UTMOST EXTREME OF MISERY
THEN WHO IS MORE MISERABLE
ONE OF WHOM I AM ABOUT TO SPEAK
WHO IS THAT
HE WHO IS OF A TYRANNICAL NATURE AND INSTEAD OF LEADING A PRIVATE LIFE
HAS BEEN CURSED WITH THE FURTHER MISFORTUNE OF BEING A PUBLIC TYRANT
FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I GATHER THAT YOU ARE RIGHT
YES I REPLIED BUT IN THIS HIGH ARGUMENT YOU SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE
CERTAIN AND SHOULD NOT CONJECTURE ONLY FOR OF ALL QUESTIONS THIS
RESPECTING GOOD AND EVIL IS THE GREATEST
VERY TRUE HE SAID
LET ME THEN OFFER YOU AN ILLUSTRATION WHICH MAY I THINK THROW A LIGHT
UPON THIS SUBJECT
WHAT IS YOUR ILLUSTRATION
THE CASE OF RICH INDIVIDUALS IN CITIES WHO POSSESS MANY SLAVES FROM
THEM YOU MAY FORM AN IDEA OF THE TYRANT'S CONDITION FOR THEY BOTH HAVE
SLAVES THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT HE HAS MORE SLAVES
YES THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
YOU KNOW THAT THEY LIVE SECURELY AND HAVE NOTHING TO APPREHEND FROM
THEIR SERVANTS
WHAT SHOULD THEY FEAR
NOTHING
BUT DO YOU OBSERVE THE REASON OF THIS
YES THE REASON IS THAT THE WHOLE CITY IS LEAGUED TOGETHER FOR THE
PROTECTION OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
VERY TRUE I SAID
BUT IMAGINE ONE OF THESE OWNERS THE MASTER SAY OF
SOME FIFTY SLAVES TOGETHER WITH HIS FAMILY AND PROPERTY AND SLAVES
CARRIED OFF BY A GOD INTO THE WILDERNESS WHERE THERE ARE NO FREEMEN TO
HELP HIM WILL HE NOT BE IN AN AGONY OF FEAR LEST HE AND HIS WIFE AND
CHILDREN SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH BY HIS SLAVES
YES HE SAID HE WILL BE IN THE UTMOST FEAR
THE TIME HAS ARRIVED WHEN HE WILL BE COMPELLED TO FLATTER DIVERS OF HIS
SLAVES AND MAKE MANY PROMISES TO THEM OF FREEDOM AND OTHER THINGS MUCH
AGAINST HIS WILL HE WILL HAVE TO CAJOLE HIS OWN SERVANTS
YES HE SAID THAT WILL BE THE ONLY WAY OF SAVING HIMSELF
AND SUPPOSE THE SAME GOD WHO CARRIED HIM AWAY TO SURROUND HIM WITH
NEIGHBOURS WHO WILL NOT SUFFER ONE MAN TO BE THE MASTER OF ANOTHER AND
WHO IF THEY COULD CATCH THE OFFENDER WOULD TAKE HIS LIFE
HIS CASE WILL BE STILL WORSE IF YOU SUPPOSE HIM TO BE EVERYWHERE
SURROUNDED AND WATCHED BY ENEMIES
AND IS NOT THIS THE SORT OF PRISON IN WHICH THE TYRANT WILL BE BOUND HE
WHO BEING BY NATURE SUCH AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED IS FULL OF ALL SORTS OF
FEARS AND LUSTS HIS SOUL IS DAINTY AND GREEDY AND YET ALONE OF ALL
MEN IN THE CITY HE IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO ON A JOURNEY OR TO SEE THE
THINGS WHICH OTHER FREEMEN DESIRE TO SEE BUT HE LIVES IN HIS HOLE LIKE
A WOMAN HIDDEN IN THE HOUSE AND IS JEALOUS OF ANY OTHER CITIZEN WHO
GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS AND SEES ANYTHING OF INTEREST
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND AMID EVILS SUCH AS THESE WILL NOT HE WHO IS ILL GOVERNED IN HIS OWN
PERSON THE TYRANNICAL MAN I MEAN WHOM YOU JUST NOW DECIDED TO BE THE
MOST MISERABLE OF ALL WILL NOT HE BE YET MORE MISERABLE WHEN INSTEAD
OF LEADING A PRIVATE LIFE HE IS CONSTRAINED BY FORTUNE TO BE A PUBLIC
TYRANT HE HAS TO BE MASTER OF OTHERS WHEN HE IS NOT MASTER OF HIMSELF
HE IS LIKE A DISEASED OR PARALYTIC MAN WHO IS COMPELLED TO PASS HIS
LIFE NOT IN RETIREMENT BUT FIGHTING AND COMBATING WITH OTHER MEN
YES HE SAID THE SIMILITUDE IS MOST EXACT
IS NOT HIS CASE UTTERLY MISERABLE AND DOES NOT THE ACTUAL TYRANT LEAD A
WORSE LIFE THAN HE WHOSE LIFE YOU DETERMINED TO BE THE WORST
CERTAINLY
HE WHO IS THE REAL TYRANT WHATEVER MEN MAY THINK IS THE REAL SLAVE
AND IS OBLIGED TO PRACTISE THE GREATEST ADULATION AND SERVILITY AND TO
BE THE FLATTERER OF THE VILEST OF MANKIND
HE HAS DESIRES WHICH HE IS
UTTERLY UNABLE TO SATISFY AND HAS MORE WANTS THAN ANY ONE AND IS TRULY
POOR IF YOU KNOW HOW TO INSPECT THE WHOLE SOUL OF HIM ALL HIS LIFE
LONG HE IS BESET WITH FEAR AND IS FULL OF CONVULSIONS AND DISTRACTIONS
EVEN AS THE STATE WHICH HE RESEMBLES AND SURELY THE RESEMBLANCE HOLDS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
MOREOVER AS WE WERE SAYING BEFORE HE GROWS WORSE FROM HAVING POWER HE
BECOMES AND IS OF NECESSITY MORE JEALOUS MORE FAITHLESS MORE UNJUST
MORE FRIENDLESS MORE IMPIOUS THAN HE WAS AT FIRST HE IS THE PURVEYOR
AND CHERISHER OF EVERY SORT OF VICE AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT HE IS
SUPREMELY MISERABLE AND THAT HE MAKES EVERYBODY ELSE AS MISERABLE AS
HIMSELF
NO MAN OF ANY SENSE WILL DISPUTE YOUR WORDS
COME THEN I SAID AND AS THE GENERAL UMPIRE IN THEATRICAL CONTESTS
PROCLAIMS THE RESULT DO YOU ALSO DECIDE WHO IN YOUR OPINION IS FIRST
IN THE SCALE OF HAPPINESS AND WHO SECOND AND IN WHAT ORDER THE OTHERS
FOLLOW THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM IN ALL THEY ARE THE ROYAL TIMOCRATICAL
OLIGARCHICAL DEMOCRATICAL TYRANNICAL
THE DECISION WILL BE EASILY GIVEN HE REPLIED THEY SHALL BE CHORUSES
COMING ON THE STAGE AND I MUST JUDGE THEM IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY
ENTER BY THE CRITERION OF VIRTUE AND VICE HAPPINESS AND MISERY
NEED WE HIRE A HERALD OR SHALL I ANNOUNCE THAT THE SON OF ARISTON THE
BEST HAS DECIDED THAT THE BEST AND JUSTEST IS ALSO THE HAPPIEST AND
THAT THIS IS HE WHO IS THE MOST ROYAL MAN AND KING OVER HIMSELF AND
THAT THE WORST AND MOST UNJUST MAN IS ALSO THE MOST MISERABLE AND THAT
THIS IS HE WHO BEING THE GREATEST TYRANT OF HIMSELF IS ALSO THE GREATEST
TYRANT OF HIS STATE
MAKE THE PROCLAMATION YOURSELF HE SAID
AND SHALL I ADD 'WHETHER SEEN OR UNSEEN BY GODS AND MEN'
LET THE WORDS BE ADDED
THEN THIS I SAID WILL BE OUR FIRST PROOF AND THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH
MAY ALSO HAVE SOME WEIGHT
WHAT IS THAT
THE SECOND PROOF IS DERIVED FROM THE NATURE OF THE SOUL SEEING THAT
THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL LIKE THE STATE HAS BEEN DIVIDED BY US INTO THREE
PRINCIPLES THE DIVISION MAY I THINK FURNISH A NEW DEMONSTRATION
OF WHAT NATURE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TO THESE THREE PRINCIPLES THREE PLEASURES
CORRESPOND ALSO THREE DESIRES AND GOVERNING POWERS
HOW DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
THERE IS ONE PRINCIPLE WITH WHICH AS WE WERE SAYING A MAN LEARNS
ANOTHER WITH WHICH HE IS ANGRY THE THIRD HAVING MANY FORMS HAS NO
SPECIAL NAME BUT IS DENOTED BY THE GENERAL TERM APPETITIVE FROM
THE EXTRAORDINARY STRENGTH AND VEHEMENCE OF THE DESIRES OF EATING AND
DRINKING AND THE OTHER SENSUAL APPETITES WHICH ARE THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF
IT ALSO MONEY LOVING BECAUSE SUCH DESIRES ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED BY
THE HELP OF MONEY
THAT IS TRUE HE SAID
IF WE WERE TO SAY THAT THE LOVES AND PLEASURES OF THIS THIRD PART WERE
CONCERNED WITH GAIN WE SHOULD THEN BE ABLE TO FALL BACK ON A SINGLE
NOTION AND MIGHT TRULY AND INTELLIGIBLY DESCRIBE THIS PART OF THE SOUL
AS LOVING GAIN OR MONEY
I AGREE WITH YOU
AGAIN IS NOT THE PASSIONATE ELEMENT WHOLLY SET ON RULING AND CONQUERING
AND GETTING FAME
TRUE
SUPPOSE WE CALL IT THE CONTENTIOUS OR AMBITIOUS WOULD THE TERM BE
SUITABLE
EXTREMELY SUITABLE
ON THE OTHER HAND EVERY ONE SEES THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF KNOWLEDGE IS
WHOLLY DIRECTED TO THE TRUTH AND CARES LESS THAN EITHER OF THE OTHERS
FOR GAIN OR FAME
FAR LESS
'LOVER OF WISDOM 'LOVER OF KNOWLEDGE ARE TITLES WHICH WE MAY FITLY
APPLY TO THAT PART OF THE SOUL
CERTAINLY
ONE PRINCIPLE PREVAILS IN THE SOULS OF ONE CLASS OF MEN ANOTHER IN
OTHERS AS MAY HAPPEN
YES
THEN WE MAY BEGIN BY ASSUMING THAT THERE ARE THREE CLASSES OF
MEN LOVERS OF WISDOM LOVERS OF HONOUR LOVERS OF GAIN
EXACTLY
AND THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF PLEASURE WHICH ARE THEIR SEVERAL OBJECTS
VERY TRUE
NOW IF YOU EXAMINE THE THREE CLASSES OF MEN AND ASK OF THEM IN TURN
WHICH OF THEIR LIVES IS PLEASANTEST EACH WILL BE FOUND PRAISING HIS
OWN AND DEPRECIATING THAT OF OTHERS THE MONEY MAKER WILL CONTRAST THE
VANITY OF HONOUR OR OF LEARNING IF THEY BRING NO MONEY WITH THE SOLID
ADVANTAGES OF GOLD AND SILVER
TRUE HE SAID
AND THE LOVER OF HONOUR WHAT WILL BE HIS OPINION WILL HE NOT THINK
THAT THE PLEASURE OF RICHES IS VULGAR WHILE THE PLEASURE OF LEARNING
IF IT BRINGS NO DISTINCTION IS ALL SMOKE AND NONSENSE TO HIM
VERY TRUE
AND ARE WE TO SUPPOSE I SAID THAT THE PHILOSOPHER SETS ANY VALUE ON
OTHER PLEASURES IN COMPARISON WITH THE PLEASURE OF KNOWING THE TRUTH
AND IN THAT PURSUIT ABIDING EVER LEARNING NOT SO FAR INDEED FROM THE
HEAVEN OF PLEASURE DOES HE NOT CALL THE OTHER PLEASURES NECESSARY
UNDER THE IDEA THAT IF THERE WERE NO NECESSITY FOR THEM HE WOULD RATHER
NOT HAVE THEM
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THAT HE REPLIED
SINCE THEN THE PLEASURES OF EACH CLASS AND THE LIFE OF EACH ARE IN
DISPUTE AND THE QUESTION IS NOT WHICH LIFE IS MORE OR LESS HONOURABLE
OR BETTER OR WORSE BUT WHICH IS THE MORE PLEASANT OR PAINLESS HOW
SHALL WE KNOW WHO SPEAKS TRULY
I CANNOT MYSELF TELL HE SAID
WELL BUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE CRITERION IS ANY BETTER THAN EXPERIENCE
AND WISDOM AND REASON
THERE CANNOT BE A BETTER HE SAID
THEN I SAID REFLECT
OF THE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST
EXPERIENCE OF ALL THE PLEASURES WHICH WE ENUMERATED HAS THE LOVER OF
GAIN IN LEARNING THE NATURE OF ESSENTIAL TRUTH GREATER EXPERIENCE OF
THE PLEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE THAN THE PHILOSOPHER HAS OF THE PLEASURE OF
GAIN
THE PHILOSOPHER HE REPLIED HAS GREATLY THE ADVANTAGE FOR HE HAS
OF NECESSITY ALWAYS KNOWN THE TASTE OF THE OTHER PLEASURES FROM HIS
CHILDHOOD UPWARDS BUT THE LOVER OF GAIN IN ALL HIS EXPERIENCE HAS NOT
OF NECESSITY TASTED OR I SHOULD RATHER SAY EVEN HAD HE DESIRED COULD
HARDLY HAVE TASTED THE SWEETNESS OF LEARNING AND KNOWING TRUTH
THEN THE LOVER OF WISDOM HAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE LOVER OF GAIN
FOR HE HAS A DOUBLE EXPERIENCE
YES VERY GREAT
AGAIN HAS HE GREATER EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURES OF HONOUR OR THE
LOVER OF HONOUR OF THE PLEASURES OF WISDOM
NAY HE SAID ALL THREE ARE HONOURED IN PROPORTION AS THEY ATTAIN THEIR
OBJECT FOR THE RICH MAN AND THE BRAVE MAN AND THE WISE MAN ALIKE HAVE
THEIR CROWD OF ADMIRERS AND AS THEY ALL RECEIVE HONOUR THEY ALL HAVE
EXPERIENCE OF THE PLEASURES OF HONOUR BUT THE DELIGHT WHICH IS TO BE
FOUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE BEING IS KNOWN TO THE PHILOSOPHER ONLY
HIS EXPERIENCE THEN WILL ENABLE HIM TO JUDGE BETTER THAN ANY ONE
FAR BETTER
AND HE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS WISDOM AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE
CERTAINLY
FURTHER THE VERY FACULTY WHICH IS THE INSTRUMENT OF JUDGMENT IS NOT
POSSESSED BY THE COVETOUS OR AMBITIOUS MAN BUT ONLY BY THE PHILOSOPHER
WHAT FACULTY
REASON WITH WHOM AS WE WERE SAYING THE DECISION OUGHT TO REST
YES
AND REASONING IS PECULIARLY HIS INSTRUMENT
CERTAINLY
IF WEALTH AND GAIN WERE THE CRITERION THEN THE PRAISE OR BLAME OF THE
LOVER OF GAIN WOULD SURELY BE THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY
ASSUREDLY
OR IF HONOUR OR VICTORY OR COURAGE IN THAT CASE THE JUDGMENT OF THE
AMBITIOUS OR PUGNACIOUS WOULD BE THE TRUEST
CLEARLY
BUT SINCE EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM AND REASON ARE THE JUDGES
THE ONLY INFERENCE POSSIBLE HE REPLIED IS THAT PLEASURES WHICH ARE
APPROVED BY THE LOVER OF WISDOM AND REASON ARE THE TRUEST
AND SO WE ARRIVE AT THE RESULT THAT THE PLEASURE OF THE INTELLIGENT
PART OF THE SOUL IS THE PLEASANTEST OF THE THREE AND THAT HE OF US IN
WHOM THIS IS THE RULING PRINCIPLE HAS THE PLEASANTEST LIFE
UNQUESTIONABLY HE SAID THE WISE MAN SPEAKS WITH AUTHORITY WHEN HE
APPROVES OF HIS OWN LIFE
AND WHAT DOES THE JUDGE AFFIRM TO BE THE LIFE WHICH IS NEXT AND THE
PLEASURE WHICH IS NEXT
CLEARLY THAT OF THE SOLDIER AND LOVER OF HONOUR WHO IS NEARER TO
HIMSELF THAN THE MONEY MAKER
LAST COMES THE LOVER OF GAIN
VERY TRUE HE SAID
TWICE IN SUCCESSION THEN HAS THE JUST MAN OVERTHROWN THE UNJUST IN
THIS CONFLICT AND NOW COMES THE THIRD TRIAL WHICH IS DEDICATED TO
OLYMPIAN ZEUS THE SAVIOUR A SAGE WHISPERS IN MY EAR THAT NO PLEASURE
EXCEPT THAT OF THE WISE IS QUITE TRUE AND PURE ALL OTHERS ARE A SHADOW
ONLY AND SURELY THIS WILL PROVE THE GREATEST AND MOST DECISIVE OF
FALLS
YES THE GREATEST BUT WILL YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF
I WILL WORK OUT THE SUBJECT AND YOU SHALL ANSWER MY QUESTIONS
PROCEED
SAY THEN IS NOT PLEASURE OPPOSED TO PAIN
TRUE
AND THERE IS A NEUTRAL STATE WHICH IS NEITHER PLEASURE NOR PAIN
THERE IS
A STATE WHICH IS INTERMEDIATE AND A SORT OF REPOSE OF THE SOUL ABOUT
EITHER THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN
YES
YOU REMEMBER WHAT PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEY ARE SICK
WHAT DO THEY SAY
THAT AFTER ALL NOTHING IS PLEASANTER THAN HEALTH
BUT THEN THEY NEVER
KNEW THIS TO BE THE GREATEST OF PLEASURES UNTIL THEY WERE ILL
YES I KNOW HE SAID
AND WHEN PERSONS ARE SUFFERING FROM ACUTE PAIN YOU MUST HAVE HEARD THEM
SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING PLEASANTER THAN TO GET RID OF THEIR PAIN
I HAVE
AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER CASES OF SUFFERING IN WHICH THE MERE REST AND
CESSATION OF PAIN AND NOT ANY POSITIVE ENJOYMENT IS EXTOLLED BY THEM
AS THE GREATEST PLEASURE
YES HE SAID AT THE TIME THEY ARE PLEASED AND WELL CONTENT TO BE AT
REST
AGAIN WHEN PLEASURE CEASES THAT SORT OF REST OR CESSATION WILL BE
PAINFUL
DOUBTLESS HE SAID
THEN THE INTERMEDIATE STATE OF REST WILL BE PLEASURE AND WILL ALSO BE
PAIN
SO IT WOULD SEEM
BUT CAN THAT WHICH IS NEITHER BECOME BOTH
I SHOULD SAY NOT
AND BOTH PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE MOTIONS OF THE SOUL ARE THEY NOT
YES
BUT THAT WHICH IS NEITHER WAS JUST NOW SHOWN TO BE REST AND NOT MOTION
AND IN A MEAN BETWEEN THEM
YES
HOW THEN CAN WE BE RIGHT IN SUPPOSING THAT THE ABSENCE OF PAIN IS
PLEASURE OR THAT THE ABSENCE OF PLEASURE IS PAIN
IMPOSSIBLE
THIS THEN IS AN APPEARANCE ONLY AND NOT A REALITY THAT IS TO SAY THE
REST IS PLEASURE AT THE MOMENT AND IN COMPARISON OF WHAT IS PAINFUL
AND PAINFUL IN COMPARISON OF WHAT IS PLEASANT BUT ALL THESE
REPRESENTATIONS WHEN TRIED BY THE TEST OF TRUE PLEASURE ARE NOT REAL
BUT A SORT OF IMPOSITION
THAT IS THE INFERENCE
LOOK AT THE OTHER CLASS OF PLEASURES WHICH HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS AND
YOU WILL NO LONGER SUPPOSE AS YOU PERHAPS MAY AT PRESENT THAT PLEASURE
IS ONLY THE CESSATION OF PAIN OR PAIN OF PLEASURE
WHAT ARE THEY HE SAID AND WHERE SHALL I FIND THEM
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE THE PLEASURES OF SMELL WHICH
ARE VERY GREAT AND HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS THEY COME IN A MOMENT AND
WHEN THEY DEPART LEAVE NO PAIN BEHIND THEM
MOST TRUE HE SAID
LET US NOT THEN BE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT PURE PLEASURE IS THE
CESSATION OF PAIN OR PAIN OF PLEASURE
NO
STILL THE MORE NUMEROUS AND VIOLENT PLEASURES WHICH REACH THE SOUL
THROUGH THE BODY ARE GENERALLY OF THIS SORT THEY ARE RELIEFS OF PAIN
THAT IS TRUE
AND THE ANTICIPATIONS OF FUTURE PLEASURES AND PAINS ARE OF A LIKE
NATURE
YES
SHALL I GIVE YOU AN ILLUSTRATION OF THEM
LET ME HEAR
YOU WOULD ALLOW I SAID THAT THERE IS IN NATURE AN UPPER AND LOWER AND
MIDDLE REGION
I SHOULD
AND IF A PERSON WERE TO GO FROM THE LOWER TO THE MIDDLE REGION WOULD
HE NOT IMAGINE THAT HE IS GOING UP AND HE WHO IS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE
AND SEES WHENCE HE HAS COME WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE IS ALREADY IN THE
UPPER REGION IF HE HAS NEVER SEEN THE TRUE UPPER WORLD
TO BE SURE HE SAID HOW CAN HE THINK OTHERWISE
BUT IF HE WERE TAKEN BACK AGAIN HE WOULD IMAGINE AND TRULY IMAGINE
THAT HE WAS DESCENDING
NO DOUBT
ALL THAT WOULD ARISE OUT OF HIS IGNORANCE OF THE TRUE UPPER AND MIDDLE
AND LOWER REGIONS
YES
THEN CAN YOU WONDER THAT PERSONS WHO ARE INEXPERIENCED IN THE TRUTH AS
THEY HAVE WRONG IDEAS ABOUT MANY OTHER THINGS SHOULD ALSO HAVE WRONG
IDEAS ABOUT PLEASURE AND PAIN AND THE INTERMEDIATE STATE SO THAT WHEN
THEY ARE ONLY BEING DRAWN TOWARDS THE PAINFUL THEY FEEL PAIN AND THINK
THE PAIN WHICH THEY EXPERIENCE TO BE REAL AND IN LIKE MANNER WHEN
DRAWN AWAY FROM PAIN TO THE NEUTRAL OR INTERMEDIATE STATE THEY FIRMLY
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE REACHED THE GOAL OF SATIETY AND PLEASURE THEY
NOT KNOWING PLEASURE ERR IN CONTRASTING PAIN WITH THE ABSENCE OF PAIN
WHICH IS LIKE CONTRASTING BLACK WITH GREY INSTEAD OF WHITE CAN YOU
WONDER I SAY AT THIS
NO INDEED I SHOULD BE MUCH MORE DISPOSED TO WONDER AT THE OPPOSITE
LOOK AT THE MATTER THUS HUNGER THIRST AND THE LIKE ARE INANITIONS
OF THE BODILY STATE
YES
AND IGNORANCE AND FOLLY ARE INANITIONS OF THE SOUL
TRUE
AND FOOD AND WISDOM ARE THE CORRESPONDING SATISFACTIONS OF EITHER
CERTAINLY
AND IS THE SATISFACTION DERIVED FROM THAT WHICH HAS LESS OR FROM THAT
WHICH HAS MORE EXISTENCE THE TRUER
CLEARLY FROM THAT WHICH HAS MORE
WHAT CLASSES OF THINGS HAVE A GREATER SHARE OF PURE EXISTENCE IN YOUR
JUDGMENT THOSE OF WHICH FOOD AND DRINK AND CONDIMENTS AND ALL KINDS OF
SUSTENANCE ARE EXAMPLES OR THE CLASS WHICH CONTAINS TRUE OPINION
AND KNOWLEDGE AND MIND AND ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF VIRTUE PUT
THE QUESTION IN THIS WAY WHICH HAS A MORE PURE BEING THAT WHICH IS
CONCERNED WITH THE INVARIABLE THE IMMORTAL AND THE TRUE AND IS OF
SUCH A NATURE AND IS FOUND IN SUCH NATURES OR THAT WHICH IS CONCERNED
WITH AND FOUND IN THE VARIABLE AND MORTAL AND IS ITSELF VARIABLE AND
MORTAL
FAR PURER HE REPLIED IS THE BEING OF THAT WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH THE
INVARIABLE
AND DOES THE ESSENCE OF THE INVARIABLE PARTAKE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE SAME
DEGREE AS OF ESSENCE
YES OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE SAME DEGREE
AND OF TRUTH IN THE SAME DEGREE
YES
AND CONVERSELY THAT WHICH HAS LESS OF TRUTH WILL ALSO HAVE LESS OF
ESSENCE
NECESSARILY
THEN IN GENERAL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WHICH ARE IN THE SERVICE OF THE
BODY HAVE LESS OF TRUTH AND ESSENCE THAN THOSE WHICH ARE IN THE SERVICE
OF THE SOUL
FAR LESS
AND HAS NOT THE BODY ITSELF LESS OF TRUTH AND ESSENCE THAN THE SOUL
YES
WHAT IS FILLED WITH MORE REAL EXISTENCE AND ACTUALLY HAS A MORE REAL
EXISTENCE IS MORE REALLY FILLED THAN THAT WHICH IS FILLED WITH LESS
REAL EXISTENCE AND IS LESS REAL
OF COURSE
AND IF THERE BE A PLEASURE IN BEING FILLED WITH THAT WHICH IS ACCORDING
TO NATURE THAT WHICH IS MORE REALLY FILLED WITH MORE REAL BEING
WILL MORE REALLY AND TRULY ENJOY TRUE PLEASURE WHEREAS THAT WHICH
PARTICIPATES IN LESS REAL BEING WILL BE LESS TRULY AND SURELY SATISFIED
AND WILL PARTICIPATE IN AN ILLUSORY AND LESS REAL PLEASURE
UNQUESTIONABLY
THOSE THEN WHO KNOW NOT WISDOM AND VIRTUE AND ARE ALWAYS BUSY WITH
GLUTTONY AND SENSUALITY GO DOWN AND UP AGAIN AS FAR AS THE MEAN AND
IN THIS REGION THEY MOVE AT RANDOM THROUGHOUT LIFE BUT THEY NEVER PASS
INTO THE TRUE UPPER WORLD THITHER THEY NEITHER LOOK NOR DO THEY EVER
FIND THEIR WAY NEITHER ARE THEY TRULY FILLED WITH TRUE BEING NOR DO
THEY TASTE OF PURE AND ABIDING PLEASURE
LIKE CATTLE WITH THEIR EYES
ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN AND THEIR HEADS STOOPING TO THE EARTH THAT IS
TO THE DINING TABLE THEY FATTEN AND FEED AND BREED AND IN THEIR
EXCESSIVE LOVE OF THESE DELIGHTS THEY KICK AND BUTT AT ONE ANOTHER WITH
HORNS AND HOOFS WHICH ARE MADE OF IRON AND THEY KILL ONE ANOTHER BY
REASON OF THEIR INSATIABLE LUST
FOR THEY FILL THEMSELVES WITH THAT
WHICH IS NOT SUBSTANTIAL AND THE PART OF THEMSELVES WHICH THEY FILL IS
ALSO UNSUBSTANTIAL AND INCONTINENT
VERILY SOCRATES SAID GLAUCON YOU DESCRIBE THE LIFE OF THE MANY LIKE
AN ORACLE
THEIR PLEASURES ARE MIXED WITH PAINS HOW CAN THEY BE OTHERWISE FOR
THEY ARE MERE SHADOWS AND PICTURES OF THE TRUE AND ARE COLOURED BY
CONTRAST WHICH EXAGGERATES BOTH LIGHT AND SHADE AND SO THEY IMPLANT
IN THE MINDS OF FOOLS INSANE DESIRES OF THEMSELVES AND THEY ARE FOUGHT
ABOUT AS STESICHORUS SAYS THAT THE GREEKS FOUGHT ABOUT THE SHADOW OF
HELEN AT TROY IN IGNORANCE OF THE TRUTH
SOMETHING OF THAT SORT MUST INEVITABLY HAPPEN
AND MUST NOT THE LIKE HAPPEN WITH THE SPIRITED OR PASSIONATE ELEMENT
OF THE SOUL WILL NOT THE PASSIONATE MAN WHO CARRIES HIS PASSION INTO
ACTION BE IN THE LIKE CASE WHETHER HE IS ENVIOUS AND AMBITIOUS OR
VIOLENT AND CONTENTIOUS OR ANGRY AND DISCONTENTED IF HE BE SEEKING
TO ATTAIN HONOUR AND VICTORY AND THE SATISFACTION OF HIS ANGER WITHOUT
REASON OR SENSE
YES HE SAID THE SAME WILL HAPPEN WITH THE SPIRITED ELEMENT ALSO
THEN MAY WE NOT CONFIDENTLY ASSERT THAT THE LOVERS OF MONEY AND HONOUR
WHEN THEY SEEK THEIR PLEASURES UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND IN THE COMPANY
OF REASON AND KNOWLEDGE AND PURSUE AFTER AND WIN THE PLEASURES WHICH
WISDOM SHOWS THEM WILL ALSO HAVE THE TRUEST PLEASURES IN THE HIGHEST
DEGREE WHICH IS ATTAINABLE TO THEM INASMUCH AS THEY FOLLOW TRUTH AND
THEY WILL HAVE THE PLEASURES WHICH ARE NATURAL TO THEM IF THAT WHICH IS
BEST FOR EACH ONE IS ALSO MOST NATURAL TO HIM
YES CERTAINLY THE BEST IS THE MOST NATURAL
AND WHEN THE WHOLE SOUL FOLLOWS THE PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLE AND THERE
IS NO DIVISION THE SEVERAL PARTS ARE JUST AND DO EACH OF THEM THEIR
OWN BUSINESS AND ENJOY SEVERALLY THE BEST AND TRUEST PLEASURES OF WHICH
THEY ARE CAPABLE
EXACTLY
BUT WHEN EITHER OF THE TWO OTHER PRINCIPLES PREVAILS IT FAILS IN
ATTAINING ITS OWN PLEASURE AND COMPELS THE REST TO PURSUE AFTER A
PLEASURE WHICH IS A SHADOW ONLY AND WHICH IS NOT THEIR OWN
TRUE
AND THE GREATER THE INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATES THEM FROM PHILOSOPHY AND
REASON THE MORE STRANGE AND ILLUSIVE WILL BE THE PLEASURE
YES
AND IS NOT THAT FARTHEST FROM REASON WHICH IS AT THE GREATEST DISTANCE
FROM LAW AND ORDER
CLEARLY
AND THE LUSTFUL AND TYRANNICAL DESIRES ARE AS WE SAW AT THE GREATEST
DISTANCE YES
AND THE ROYAL AND ORDERLY DESIRES ARE NEAREST
YES
THEN THE TYRANT WILL LIVE AT THE GREATEST DISTANCE FROM TRUE OR NATURAL
PLEASURE AND THE KING AT THE LEAST
CERTAINLY
BUT IF SO THE TYRANT WILL LIVE MOST UNPLEASANTLY AND THE KING MOST
PLEASANTLY
INEVITABLY
WOULD YOU KNOW THE MEASURE OF THE INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATES THEM
WILL YOU TELL ME
THERE APPEAR TO BE THREE PLEASURES ONE GENUINE AND TWO SPURIOUS NOW
THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE TYRANT REACHES A POINT BEYOND THE SPURIOUS HE
HAS RUN AWAY FROM THE REGION OF LAW AND REASON AND TAKEN UP HIS ABODE
WITH CERTAIN SLAVE PLEASURES WHICH ARE HIS SATELLITES AND THE MEASURE
OF HIS INFERIORITY CAN ONLY BE EXPRESSED IN A FIGURE
HOW DO YOU MEAN
I ASSUME I SAID THAT THE TYRANT IS IN THE THIRD PLACE FROM THE
OLIGARCH THE DEMOCRAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE
YES
AND IF THERE IS TRUTH IN WHAT HAS PRECEDED HE WILL BE WEDDED TO AN
IMAGE OF PLEASURE WHICH IS THRICE REMOVED AS TO TRUTH FROM THE PLEASURE
OF THE OLIGARCH
HE WILL
AND THE OLIGARCH IS THIRD FROM THE ROYAL SINCE WE COUNT AS ONE ROYAL
AND ARISTOCRATICAL
YES HE IS THIRD
THEN THE TYRANT IS REMOVED FROM TRUE PLEASURE BY THE SPACE OF A NUMBER
WHICH IS THREE TIMES THREE
MANIFESTLY
THE SHADOW THEN OF TYRANNICAL PLEASURE DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF
LENGTH WILL BE A PLANE FIGURE
CERTAINLY
AND IF YOU RAISE THE POWER AND MAKE THE PLANE A SOLID THERE IS NO
DIFFICULTY IN SEEING HOW VAST IS THE INTERVAL BY WHICH THE TYRANT IS
PARTED FROM THE KING
YES THE ARITHMETICIAN WILL EASILY DO THE SUM
OR IF SOME PERSON BEGINS AT THE OTHER END AND MEASURES THE INTERVAL BY
WHICH THE KING IS PARTED FROM THE TYRANT IN TRUTH OF PLEASURE HE WILL
FIND HIM WHEN THE MULTIPLICATION IS COMPLETED LIVING 729 TIMES MORE
PLEASANTLY AND THE TYRANT MORE PAINFULLY BY THIS SAME INTERVAL
WHAT A WONDERFUL CALCULATION AND HOW ENORMOUS IS THE DISTANCE WHICH
SEPARATES THE JUST FROM THE UNJUST IN REGARD TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
YET A TRUE CALCULATION I SAID AND A NUMBER WHICH NEARLY CONCERNS HUMAN
LIFE IF HUMAN BEINGS ARE CONCERNED WITH DAYS AND NIGHTS AND MONTHS AND
YEARS
729 NEARLY EQUALS THE NUMBER OF DAYS AND NIGHTS IN THE YEAR
YES HE SAID HUMAN LIFE IS CERTAINLY CONCERNED WITH THEM
THEN IF THE GOOD AND JUST MAN BE THUS SUPERIOR IN PLEASURE TO THE EVIL
AND UNJUST HIS SUPERIORITY WILL BE INFINITELY GREATER IN PROPRIETY OF
LIFE AND IN BEAUTY AND VIRTUE
IMMEASURABLY GREATER
WELL I SAID AND NOW HAVING ARRIVED AT THIS STAGE OF THE ARGUMENT WE
MAY REVERT TO THE WORDS WHICH BROUGHT US HITHER WAS NOT SOME ONE SAYING
THAT INJUSTICE WAS A GAIN TO THE PERFECTLY UNJUST WHO WAS REPUTED TO BE
JUST
YES THAT WAS SAID
NOW THEN HAVING DETERMINED THE POWER AND QUALITY OF JUSTICE AND
INJUSTICE LET US HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH HIM
WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO HIM
LET US MAKE AN IMAGE OF THE SOUL THAT HE MAY HAVE HIS OWN WORDS
PRESENTED BEFORE HIS EYES
OF WHAT SORT
AN IDEAL IMAGE OF THE SOUL LIKE THE COMPOSITE CREATIONS OF ANCIENT
MYTHOLOGY SUCH AS THE CHIMERA OR SCYLLA OR CERBERUS AND THERE ARE MANY
OTHERS IN WHICH TWO OR MORE DIFFERENT NATURES ARE SAID TO GROW INTO ONE
THERE ARE SAID OF HAVE BEEN SUCH UNIONS
THEN DO YOU NOW MODEL THE FORM OF A MULTITUDINOUS MANY HEADED MONSTER
HAVING A RING OF HEADS OF ALL MANNER OF BEASTS TAME AND WILD WHICH HE
IS ABLE TO GENERATE AND METAMORPHOSE AT WILL
YOU SUPPOSE MARVELLOUS POWERS IN THE ARTIST BUT AS LANGUAGE IS MORE
PLIABLE THAN WAX OR ANY SIMILAR SUBSTANCE LET THERE BE SUCH A MODEL AS
YOU PROPOSE
SUPPOSE NOW THAT YOU MAKE A SECOND FORM AS OF A LION AND A THIRD OF A
MAN THE SECOND SMALLER THAN THE FIRST AND THE THIRD SMALLER THAN THE
SECOND
THAT HE SAID IS AN EASIER TASK AND I HAVE MADE THEM AS YOU SAY
AND NOW JOIN THEM AND LET THE THREE GROW INTO ONE
THAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
NEXT FASHION THE OUTSIDE OF THEM INTO A SINGLE IMAGE AS OF A MAN SO
THAT HE WHO IS NOT ABLE TO LOOK WITHIN AND SEES ONLY THE OUTER HULL
MAY BELIEVE THE BEAST TO BE A SINGLE HUMAN CREATURE
I HAVE DONE SO HE SAID
AND NOW TO HIM WHO MAINTAINS THAT IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THE HUMAN
CREATURE TO BE UNJUST AND UNPROFITABLE TO BE JUST LET US REPLY
THAT IF HE BE RIGHT IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THIS CREATURE TO FEAST
THE MULTITUDINOUS MONSTER AND STRENGTHEN THE LION AND THE LION LIKE
QUALITIES BUT TO STARVE AND WEAKEN THE MAN WHO IS CONSEQUENTLY LIABLE
TO BE DRAGGED ABOUT AT THE MERCY OF EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO AND HE IS
NOT TO ATTEMPT TO FAMILIARIZE OR HARMONIZE THEM WITH ONE ANOTHER HE
OUGHT RATHER TO SUFFER THEM TO FIGHT AND BITE AND DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER
CERTAINLY HE SAID THAT IS WHAT THE APPROVER OF INJUSTICE SAYS
TO HIM THE SUPPORTER OF JUSTICE MAKES ANSWER THAT HE SHOULD EVER SO
SPEAK AND ACT AS TO GIVE THE MAN WITHIN HIM IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THE
MOST COMPLETE MASTERY OVER THE ENTIRE HUMAN CREATURE
HE SHOULD WATCH
OVER THE MANY HEADED MONSTER LIKE A GOOD HUSBANDMAN FOSTERING AND
CULTIVATING THE GENTLE QUALITIES AND PREVENTING THE WILD ONES FROM
GROWING HE SHOULD BE MAKING THE LION HEART HIS ALLY AND IN COMMON CARE
OF THEM ALL SHOULD BE UNITING THE SEVERAL PARTS WITH ONE ANOTHER AND
WITH HIMSELF
YES HE SAID THAT IS QUITE WHAT THE MAINTAINER OF JUSTICE SAY
AND SO FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW WHETHER OF PLEASURE HONOUR OR
ADVANTAGE THE APPROVER OF JUSTICE IS RIGHT AND SPEAKS THE TRUTH AND
THE DISAPPROVER IS WRONG AND FALSE AND IGNORANT
YES FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW
COME NOW AND LET US GENTLY REASON WITH THE UNJUST WHO IS NOT
INTENTIONALLY IN ERROR
'SWEET SIR WE WILL SAY TO HIM 'WHAT THINK
YOU OF THINGS ESTEEMED NOBLE AND IGNOBLE IS NOT THE NOBLE THAT WHICH
SUBJECTS THE BEAST TO THE MAN OR RATHER TO THE GOD IN MAN AND THE
IGNOBLE THAT WHICH SUBJECTS THE MAN TO THE BEAST HE CAN HARDLY AVOID
SAYING YES CAN HE NOW
NOT IF HE HAS ANY REGARD FOR MY OPINION
BUT IF HE AGREE SO FAR WE MAY ASK HIM TO ANSWER ANOTHER QUESTION
'THEN HOW WOULD A MAN PROFIT IF HE RECEIVED GOLD AND SILVER ON THE
CONDITION THAT HE WAS TO ENSLAVE THE NOBLEST PART OF HIM TO THE WORST
WHO CAN IMAGINE THAT A MAN WHO SOLD HIS SON OR DAUGHTER INTO SLAVERY FOR
MONEY ESPECIALLY IF HE SOLD THEM INTO THE HANDS OF FIERCE AND EVIL MEN
WOULD BE THE GAINER HOWEVER LARGE MIGHT BE THE SUM WHICH HE
RECEIVED AND WILL ANY ONE SAY THAT HE IS NOT A MISERABLE CAITIFF WHO
REMORSELESSLY SELLS HIS OWN DIVINE BEING TO THAT WHICH IS MOST GODLESS
AND DETESTABLE ERIPHYLE TOOK THE NECKLACE AS THE PRICE OF HER HUSBAND'S
LIFE BUT HE IS TAKING A BRIBE IN ORDER TO COMPASS A WORSE RUIN
YES SAID GLAUCON FAR WORSE I WILL ANSWER FOR HIM
HAS NOT THE INTEMPERATE BEEN CENSURED OF OLD BECAUSE IN HIM THE HUGE
MULTIFORM MONSTER IS ALLOWED TO BE TOO MUCH AT LARGE
CLEARLY
AND MEN ARE BLAMED FOR PRIDE AND BAD TEMPER WHEN THE LION AND SERPENT
ELEMENT IN THEM DISPROPORTIONATELY GROWS AND GAINS STRENGTH
YES
AND LUXURY AND SOFTNESS ARE BLAMED BECAUSE THEY RELAX AND WEAKEN THIS
SAME CREATURE AND MAKE A COWARD OF HIM
VERY TRUE
AND IS NOT A MAN REPROACHED FOR FLATTERY AND MEANNESS WHO SUBORDINATES
THE SPIRITED ANIMAL TO THE UNRULY MONSTER AND FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY
OF WHICH HE CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH HABITUATES HIM IN THE DAYS OF HIS
YOUTH TO BE TRAMPLED IN THE MIRE AND FROM BEING A LION TO BECOME A
MONKEY
TRUE HE SAID
AND WHY ARE MEAN EMPLOYMENTS AND MANUAL ARTS A REPROACH ONLY BECAUSE
THEY IMPLY A NATURAL WEAKNESS OF THE HIGHER PRINCIPLE THE INDIVIDUAL IS
UNABLE TO CONTROL THE CREATURES WITHIN HIM BUT HAS TO COURT THEM AND
HIS GREAT STUDY IS HOW TO FLATTER THEM
SUCH APPEARS TO BE THE REASON
AND THEREFORE BEING DESIROUS OF PLACING HIM UNDER A RULE LIKE THAT OF
THE BEST WE SAY THAT HE OUGHT TO BE THE SERVANT OF THE BEST IN WHOM
THE DIVINE RULES NOT AS THRASYMACHUS SUPPOSED TO THE INJURY OF THE
SERVANT BUT BECAUSE EVERY ONE HAD BETTER BE RULED BY DIVINE WISDOM
DWELLING WITHIN HIM OR IF THIS BE IMPOSSIBLE THEN BY AN EXTERNAL
AUTHORITY IN ORDER THAT WE MAY BE ALL AS FAR AS POSSIBLE UNDER THE
SAME GOVERNMENT FRIENDS AND EQUALS
TRUE HE SAID
AND THIS IS CLEARLY SEEN TO BE THE INTENTION OF THE LAW WHICH IS THE
ALLY OF THE WHOLE CITY AND IS SEEN ALSO IN THE AUTHORITY WHICH WE
EXERCISE OVER CHILDREN AND THE REFUSAL TO LET THEM BE FREE UNTIL WE
HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THEM A PRINCIPLE ANALOGOUS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF
A STATE AND BY CULTIVATION OF THIS HIGHER ELEMENT HAVE SET UP IN THEIR
HEARTS A GUARDIAN AND RULER LIKE OUR OWN AND WHEN THIS IS DONE THEY MAY
GO THEIR WAYS
YES HE SAID THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW IS MANIFEST
FROM WHAT POINT OF VIEW THEN AND ON WHAT GROUND CAN WE SAY THAT A MAN
IS PROFITED BY INJUSTICE OR INTEMPERANCE OR OTHER BASENESS WHICH WILL
MAKE HIM A WORSE MAN EVEN THOUGH HE ACQUIRE MONEY OR POWER BY HIS
WICKEDNESS
FROM NO POINT OF VIEW AT ALL
WHAT SHALL HE PROFIT IF HIS INJUSTICE BE UNDETECTED AND UNPUNISHED
HE WHO IS UNDETECTED ONLY GETS WORSE WHEREAS HE WHO IS DETECTED AND
PUNISHED HAS THE BRUTAL PART OF HIS NATURE SILENCED AND HUMANIZED THE
GENTLER ELEMENT IN HIM IS LIBERATED AND HIS WHOLE SOUL IS PERFECTED AND
ENNOBLED BY THE ACQUIREMENT OF JUSTICE AND TEMPERANCE AND WISDOM MORE
THAN THE BODY EVER IS BY RECEIVING GIFTS OF BEAUTY STRENGTH AND HEALTH
IN PROPORTION AS THE SOUL IS MORE HONOURABLE THAN THE BODY
CERTAINLY HE SAID
TO THIS NOBLER PURPOSE THE MAN OF UNDERSTANDING WILL DEVOTE THE ENERGIES
OF HIS LIFE
AND IN THE FIRST PLACE HE WILL HONOUR STUDIES WHICH
IMPRESS THESE QUALITIES ON HIS SOUL AND WILL DISREGARD OTHERS
CLEARLY HE SAID
IN THE NEXT PLACE HE WILL REGULATE HIS BODILY HABIT AND TRAINING AND
SO FAR WILL HE BE FROM YIELDING TO BRUTAL AND IRRATIONAL PLEASURES THAT
HE WILL REGARD EVEN HEALTH AS QUITE A SECONDARY MATTER HIS FIRST OBJECT
WILL BE NOT THAT HE MAY BE FAIR OR STRONG OR WELL UNLESS HE IS LIKELY
THEREBY TO GAIN TEMPERANCE BUT HE WILL ALWAYS DESIRE SO TO ATTEMPER THE
BODY AS TO PRESERVE THE HARMONY OF THE SOUL
CERTAINLY HE WILL IF HE HAS TRUE MUSIC IN HIM
AND IN THE ACQUISITION OF WEALTH THERE IS A PRINCIPLE OF ORDER AND
HARMONY WHICH HE WILL ALSO OBSERVE HE WILL NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE
DAZZLED BY THE FOOLISH APPLAUSE OF THE WORLD AND HEAP UP RICHES TO HIS
OWN INFINITE HARM
CERTAINLY NOT HE SAID
HE WILL LOOK AT THE CITY WHICH IS WITHIN HIM AND TAKE HEED THAT NO
DISORDER OCCUR IN IT SUCH AS MIGHT ARISE EITHER FROM SUPERFLUITY OR
FROM WANT AND UPON THIS PRINCIPLE HE WILL REGULATE HIS PROPERTY AND
GAIN OR SPEND ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS
VERY TRUE
AND FOR THE SAME REASON HE WILL GLADLY ACCEPT AND ENJOY SUCH HONOURS
AS HE DEEMS LIKELY TO MAKE HIM A BETTER MAN BUT THOSE WHETHER PRIVATE
OR PUBLIC WHICH ARE LIKELY TO DISORDER HIS LIFE HE WILL AVOID
THEN IF THAT IS HIS MOTIVE HE WILL NOT BE A STATESMAN
BY THE DOG OF EGYPT HE WILL IN THE CITY WHICH IS HIS OWN HE CERTAINLY
WILL THOUGH IN THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH PERHAPS NOT UNLESS HE HAVE A
DIVINE CALL
I UNDERSTAND YOU MEAN THAT HE WILL BE A RULER IN THE CITY OF WHICH WE
ARE THE FOUNDERS AND WHICH EXISTS IN IDEA ONLY FOR I DO NOT BELIEVE
THAT THERE IS SUCH AN ONE ANYWHERE ON EARTH
IN HEAVEN I REPLIED THERE IS LAID UP A PATTERN OF IT METHINKS WHICH
HE WHO DESIRES MAY BEHOLD AND BEHOLDING MAY SET HIS OWN HOUSE IN
ORDER
BUT WHETHER SUCH AN ONE EXISTS OR EVER WILL EXIST IN FACT IS NO
MATTER FOR HE WILL LIVE AFTER THE MANNER OF THAT CITY HAVING NOTHING
TO DO WITH ANY OTHER
I THINK SO HE SAID
BOOK X
OF THE MANY EXCELLENCES WHICH I PERCEIVE IN THE ORDER OF OUR STATE
THERE IS NONE WHICH UPON REFLECTION PLEASES ME BETTER THAN THE RULE
ABOUT POETRY
TO WHAT DO YOU REFER
TO THE REJECTION OF IMITATIVE POETRY WHICH CERTAINLY OUGHT NOT TO BE
RECEIVED AS I SEE FAR MORE CLEARLY NOW THAT THE PARTS OF THE SOUL HAVE
BEEN DISTINGUISHED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SPEAKING IN CONFIDENCE FOR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE MY WORDS REPEATED
TO THE TRAGEDIANS AND THE REST OF THE IMITATIVE TRIBE BUT I DO NOT
MIND SAYING TO YOU THAT ALL POETICAL IMITATIONS ARE RUINOUS TO THE
UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEARERS AND THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR TRUE
NATURE IS THE ONLY ANTIDOTE TO THEM
EXPLAIN THE PURPORT OF YOUR REMARK
WELL I WILL TELL YOU ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS FROM MY EARLIEST YOUTH HAD
AN AWE AND LOVE OF HOMER WHICH EVEN NOW MAKES THE WORDS FALTER ON
MY LIPS FOR HE IS THE GREAT CAPTAIN AND TEACHER OF THE WHOLE OF THAT
CHARMING TRAGIC COMPANY BUT A MAN IS NOT TO BE REVERENCED MORE THAN THE
TRUTH AND THEREFORE I WILL SPEAK OUT
VERY GOOD HE SAID
LISTEN TO ME THEN OR RATHER ANSWER ME
PUT YOUR QUESTION
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IMITATION IS FOR I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
A LIKELY THING THEN THAT I SHOULD KNOW
WHY NOT FOR THE DULLER EYE MAY OFTEN SEE A THING SOONER THAN THE
KEENER
VERY TRUE HE SAID BUT IN YOUR PRESENCE EVEN IF I HAD ANY FAINT
NOTION I COULD NOT MUSTER COURAGE TO UTTER IT
WILL YOU ENQUIRE
YOURSELF
WELL THEN SHALL WE BEGIN THE ENQUIRY IN OUR USUAL MANNER WHENEVER A
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE A COMMON NAME WE ASSUME THEM TO HAVE ALSO A
CORRESPONDING IDEA OR FORM DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME
I DO
LET US TAKE ANY COMMON INSTANCE THERE ARE BEDS AND TABLES IN THE
WORLD PLENTY OF THEM ARE THERE NOT
YES
BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO IDEAS OR FORMS OF THEM ONE THE IDEA OF A BED
THE OTHER OF A TABLE
TRUE
AND THE MAKER OF EITHER OF THEM MAKES A BED OR HE MAKES A TABLE FOR OUR
USE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IDEA THAT IS OUR WAY OF SPEAKING IN THIS
AND SIMILAR INSTANCES BUT NO ARTIFICER MAKES THE IDEAS THEMSELVES HOW
COULD HE
IMPOSSIBLE
AND THERE IS ANOTHER ARTIST I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD SAY
OF HIM
WHO IS HE
ONE WHO IS THE MAKER OF ALL THE WORKS OF ALL OTHER WORKMEN
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN
WAIT A LITTLE AND THERE WILL BE MORE REASON FOR YOUR SAYING SO
FOR
THIS IS HE WHO IS ABLE TO MAKE NOT ONLY VESSELS OF EVERY KIND BUT
PLANTS AND ANIMALS HIMSELF AND ALL OTHER THINGS THE EARTH AND HEAVEN
AND THE THINGS WHICH ARE IN HEAVEN OR UNDER THE EARTH HE MAKES THE GODS
ALSO
HE MUST BE A WIZARD AND NO MISTAKE
OH YOU ARE INCREDULOUS ARE YOU DO YOU MEAN THAT THERE IS NO SUCH
MAKER OR CREATOR OR THAT IN ONE SENSE THERE MIGHT BE A MAKER OF ALL
THESE THINGS BUT IN ANOTHER NOT DO YOU SEE THAT THERE IS A WAY IN WHICH
YOU COULD MAKE THEM ALL YOURSELF
WHAT WAY
AN EASY WAY ENOUGH OR RATHER THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THE FEAT
MIGHT BE QUICKLY AND EASILY ACCOMPLISHED NONE QUICKER THAN THAT OF
TURNING A MIRROR ROUND AND ROUND YOU WOULD SOON ENOUGH MAKE THE SUN AND
THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH AND YOURSELF AND OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS
AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS OF WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW SPEAKING IN THE
MIRROR
YES HE SAID BUT THEY WOULD BE APPEARANCES ONLY
VERY GOOD I SAID YOU ARE COMING TO THE POINT NOW
AND THE PAINTER TOO
IS AS I CONCEIVE JUST SUCH ANOTHER A CREATOR OF APPEARANCES IS HE
NOT
OF COURSE
BUT THEN I SUPPOSE YOU WILL SAY THAT WHAT HE CREATES IS UNTRUE
AND YET
THERE IS A SENSE IN WHICH THE PAINTER ALSO CREATES A BED
YES HE SAID BUT NOT A REAL BED
AND WHAT OF THE MAKER OF THE BED WERE YOU NOT SAYING THAT HE TOO MAKES
NOT THE IDEA WHICH ACCORDING TO OUR VIEW IS THE ESSENCE OF THE BED
BUT ONLY A PARTICULAR BED
YES I DID
THEN IF HE DOES NOT MAKE THAT WHICH EXISTS HE CANNOT MAKE TRUE
EXISTENCE BUT ONLY SOME SEMBLANCE OF EXISTENCE AND IF ANY ONE WERE TO
SAY THAT THE WORK OF THE MAKER OF THE BED OR OF ANY OTHER WORKMAN HAS
REAL EXISTENCE HE COULD HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO BE SPEAKING THE TRUTH
AT ANY RATE HE REPLIED PHILOSOPHERS WOULD SAY THAT HE WAS NOT SPEAKING
THE TRUTH
NO WONDER THEN THAT HIS WORK TOO IS AN INDISTINCT EXPRESSION OF TRUTH
NO WONDER
SUPPOSE NOW THAT BY THE LIGHT OF THE EXAMPLES JUST OFFERED WE ENQUIRE
WHO THIS IMITATOR IS
IF YOU PLEASE
WELL THEN HERE ARE THREE BEDS ONE EXISTING IN NATURE WHICH IS MADE BY
GOD AS I THINK THAT WE MAY SAY FOR NO ONE ELSE CAN BE THE MAKER
NO
THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH IS THE WORK OF THE CARPENTER
YES
AND THE WORK OF THE PAINTER IS A THIRD
YES
BEDS THEN ARE OF THREE KINDS AND THERE ARE THREE ARTISTS WHO
SUPERINTEND THEM GOD THE MAKER OF THE BED AND THE PAINTER
YES THERE ARE THREE OF THEM
GOD WHETHER FROM CHOICE OR FROM NECESSITY MADE ONE BED IN NATURE AND
ONE ONLY TWO OR MORE SUCH IDEAL BEDS NEITHER EVER HAVE BEEN NOR EVER
WILL BE MADE BY GOD
WHY IS THAT
BECAUSE EVEN IF HE HAD MADE BUT TWO A THIRD WOULD STILL APPEAR BEHIND
THEM WHICH BOTH OF THEM WOULD HAVE FOR THEIR IDEA AND THAT WOULD BE THE
IDEAL BED AND NOT THE TWO OTHERS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
GOD KNEW THIS AND HE DESIRED TO BE THE REAL MAKER OF A REAL BED NOT
A PARTICULAR MAKER OF A PARTICULAR BED AND THEREFORE HE CREATED A BED
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AND BY NATURE ONE ONLY
SO WE BELIEVE
SHALL WE THEN SPEAK OF HIM AS THE NATURAL AUTHOR OR MAKER OF THE BED
YES HE REPLIED INASMUCH AS BY THE NATURAL PROCESS OF CREATION HE IS
THE AUTHOR OF THIS AND OF ALL OTHER THINGS
AND WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF THE CARPENTER IS NOT HE ALSO THE MAKER OF THE
BED
YES
BUT WOULD YOU CALL THE PAINTER A CREATOR AND MAKER
CERTAINLY NOT
YET IF HE IS NOT THE MAKER WHAT IS HE IN RELATION TO THE BED
I THINK HE SAID THAT WE MAY FAIRLY DESIGNATE HIM AS THE IMITATOR OF
THAT WHICH THE OTHERS MAKE
GOOD I SAID THEN YOU CALL HIM WHO IS THIRD IN THE DESCENT FROM NATURE
AN IMITATOR
CERTAINLY HE SAID
AND THE TRAGIC POET IS AN IMITATOR AND THEREFORE LIKE ALL OTHER
IMITATORS HE IS THRICE REMOVED FROM THE KING AND FROM THE TRUTH
THAT APPEARS TO BE SO
THEN ABOUT THE IMITATOR WE ARE AGREED
AND WHAT ABOUT THE PAINTER I
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER HE MAY BE THOUGHT TO IMITATE THAT WHICH
ORIGINALLY EXISTS IN NATURE OR ONLY THE CREATIONS OF ARTISTS
THE LATTER
AS THEY ARE OR AS THEY APPEAR YOU HAVE STILL TO DETERMINE THIS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN THAT YOU MAY LOOK AT A BED FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW
OBLIQUELY OR DIRECTLY OR FROM ANY OTHER POINT OF VIEW AND THE BED WILL
APPEAR DIFFERENT BUT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN REALITY
AND THE SAME OF
ALL THINGS
YES HE SAID THE DIFFERENCE IS ONLY APPARENT
NOW LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH IS THE ART OF PAINTING
DESIGNED TO BE AN IMITATION OF THINGS AS THEY ARE OR AS THEY
APPEAR OF APPEARANCE OR OF REALITY
OF APPEARANCE
THEN THE IMITATOR I SAID IS A LONG WAY OFF THE TRUTH AND CAN DO ALL
THINGS BECAUSE HE LIGHTLY TOUCHES ON A SMALL PART OF THEM AND THAT PART
AN IMAGE
FOR EXAMPLE A PAINTER WILL PAINT A COBBLER CARPENTER OR
ANY OTHER ARTIST THOUGH HE KNOWS NOTHING OF THEIR ARTS AND IF HE IS
A GOOD ARTIST HE MAY DECEIVE CHILDREN OR SIMPLE PERSONS WHEN HE SHOWS
THEM HIS PICTURE OF A CARPENTER FROM A DISTANCE AND THEY WILL FANCY
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT A REAL CARPENTER
CERTAINLY
AND WHENEVER ANY ONE INFORMS US THAT HE HAS FOUND A MAN WHO KNOWS ALL
THE ARTS AND ALL THINGS ELSE THAT ANYBODY KNOWS AND EVERY SINGLE THING
WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF ACCURACY THAN ANY OTHER MAN WHOEVER TELLS US
THIS I THINK THAT WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE HIM TO BE A SIMPLE CREATURE WHO
IS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY SOME WIZARD OR ACTOR WHOM HE MET AND
WHOM HE THOUGHT ALL KNOWING BECAUSE HE HIMSELF WAS UNABLE TO ANALYSE
THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE AND IMITATION
MOST TRUE
AND SO WHEN WE HEAR PERSONS SAYING THAT THE TRAGEDIANS AND HOMER WHO
IS AT THEIR HEAD KNOW ALL THE ARTS AND ALL THINGS HUMAN VIRTUE AS WELL
AS VICE AND DIVINE THINGS TOO FOR THAT THE GOOD POET CANNOT COMPOSE
WELL UNLESS HE KNOWS HIS SUBJECT AND THAT HE WHO HAS NOT THIS KNOWLEDGE
CAN NEVER BE A POET WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER HERE ALSO THERE MAY
NOT BE A SIMILAR ILLUSION
PERHAPS THEY MAY HAVE COME ACROSS IMITATORS
AND BEEN DECEIVED BY THEM THEY MAY NOT HAVE REMEMBERED WHEN THEY SAW
THEIR WORKS THAT THESE WERE BUT IMITATIONS THRICE REMOVED FROM THE
TRUTH AND COULD EASILY BE MADE WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH
BECAUSE THEY ARE APPEARANCES ONLY AND NOT REALITIES OR AFTER ALL THEY
MAY BE IN THE RIGHT AND POETS DO REALLY KNOW THE THINGS ABOUT WHICH
THEY SEEM TO THE MANY TO SPEAK SO WELL
THE QUESTION HE SAID SHOULD BY ALL MEANS BE CONSIDERED
NOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IF A PERSON WERE ABLE TO MAKE THE ORIGINAL AS
WELL AS THE IMAGE HE WOULD SERIOUSLY DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE IMAGE MAKING
BRANCH WOULD HE ALLOW IMITATION TO BE THE RULING PRINCIPLE OF HIS LIFE
AS IF HE HAD NOTHING HIGHER IN HIM
I SHOULD SAY NOT
THE REAL ARTIST WHO KNEW WHAT HE WAS IMITATING WOULD BE INTERESTED IN
REALITIES AND NOT IN IMITATIONS AND WOULD DESIRE TO LEAVE AS MEMORIALS
OF HIMSELF WORKS MANY AND FAIR AND INSTEAD OF BEING THE AUTHOR OF
ENCOMIUMS HE WOULD PREFER TO BE THE THEME OF THEM
YES HE SAID THAT WOULD BE TO HIM A SOURCE OF MUCH GREATER HONOUR AND
PROFIT
THEN I SAID WE MUST PUT A QUESTION TO HOMER NOT ABOUT MEDICINE OR
ANY OF THE ARTS TO WHICH HIS POEMS ONLY INCIDENTALLY REFER WE ARE NOT
GOING TO ASK HIM OR ANY OTHER POET WHETHER HE HAS CURED PATIENTS
LIKE ASCLEPIUS OR LEFT BEHIND HIM A SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SUCH AS THE
ASCLEPIADS WERE OR WHETHER HE ONLY TALKS ABOUT MEDICINE AND OTHER ARTS
AT SECOND HAND BUT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW RESPECTING MILITARY TACTICS
POLITICS EDUCATION WHICH ARE THE CHIEFEST AND NOBLEST SUBJECTS OF HIS
POEMS AND WE MAY FAIRLY ASK HIM ABOUT THEM
'FRIEND HOMER THEN WE SAY
TO HIM 'IF YOU ARE ONLY IN THE SECOND REMOVE FROM TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY
OF VIRTUE AND NOT IN THE THIRD NOT AN IMAGE MAKER OR IMITATOR AND
IF YOU ARE ABLE TO DISCERN WHAT PURSUITS MAKE MEN BETTER OR WORSE IN
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC LIFE TELL US WHAT STATE WAS EVER BETTER GOVERNED BY
YOUR HELP THE GOOD ORDER OF LACEDAEMON IS DUE TO LYCURGUS AND MANY
OTHER CITIES GREAT AND SMALL HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY BENEFITED BY OTHERS
BUT WHO SAYS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A GOOD LEGISLATOR TO THEM AND HAVE DONE
THEM ANY GOOD ITALY AND SICILY BOAST OF CHARONDAS AND THERE IS SOLON
WHO IS RENOWNED AMONG US BUT WHAT CITY HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT YOU
IS THERE ANY CITY WHICH HE MIGHT NAME
I THINK NOT SAID GLAUCON NOT EVEN THE HOMERIDS THEMSELVES PRETEND THAT
HE WAS A LEGISLATOR
WELL BUT IS THERE ANY WAR ON RECORD WHICH WAS CARRIED ON SUCCESSFULLY
BY HIM OR AIDED BY HIS COUNSELS WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
THERE IS NOT
OR IS THERE ANY INVENTION OF HIS APPLICABLE TO THE ARTS OR TO HUMAN
LIFE SUCH AS THALES THE MILESIAN OR ANACHARSIS THE SCYTHIAN AND OTHER
INGENIOUS MEN HAVE CONCEIVED WHICH IS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF THE KIND
BUT IF HOMER NEVER DID ANY PUBLIC SERVICE WAS HE PRIVATELY A GUIDE OR
TEACHER OF ANY HAD HE IN HIS LIFETIME FRIENDS WHO LOVED TO ASSOCIATE
WITH HIM AND WHO HANDED DOWN TO POSTERITY AN HOMERIC WAY OF LIFE SUCH
AS WAS ESTABLISHED BY PYTHAGORAS WHO WAS SO GREATLY BELOVED FOR HIS
WISDOM AND WHOSE FOLLOWERS ARE TO THIS DAY QUITE CELEBRATED FOR THE
ORDER WHICH WAS NAMED AFTER HIM
NOTHING OF THE KIND IS RECORDED OF HIM
FOR SURELY SOCRATES
CREOPHYLUS THE COMPANION OF HOMER THAT CHILD OF FLESH WHOSE NAME
ALWAYS MAKES US LAUGH MIGHT BE MORE JUSTLY RIDICULED FOR HIS STUPIDITY
IF AS IS SAID HOMER WAS GREATLY NEGLECTED BY HIM AND OTHERS IN HIS OWN
DAY WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
YES I REPLIED THAT IS THE TRADITION
BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE GLAUCON
THAT IF HOMER HAD REALLY BEEN ABLE TO EDUCATE AND IMPROVE MANKIND IF HE
HAD POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE AND NOT BEEN A MERE IMITATOR CAN YOU IMAGINE
I SAY THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MANY FOLLOWERS AND BEEN HONOURED AND
LOVED BY THEM PROTAGORAS OF ABDERA AND PRODICUS OF CEOS AND A HOST OF
OTHERS HAVE ONLY TO WHISPER TO THEIR CONTEMPORARIES 'YOU WILL NEVER BE
ABLE TO MANAGE EITHER YOUR OWN HOUSE OR YOUR OWN STATE UNTIL YOU APPOINT
US TO BE YOUR MINISTERS OF EDUCATION' AND THIS INGENIOUS DEVICE OF
THEIRS HAS SUCH AN EFFECT IN MAKING MEN LOVE THEM THAT THEIR COMPANIONS
ALL BUT CARRY THEM ABOUT ON THEIR SHOULDERS
AND IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT
THE CONTEMPORARIES OF HOMER OR AGAIN OF HESIOD WOULD HAVE ALLOWED
EITHER OF THEM TO GO ABOUT AS RHAPSODISTS IF THEY HAD REALLY BEEN ABLE
TO MAKE MANKIND VIRTUOUS WOULD THEY NOT HAVE BEEN AS UNWILLING TO PART
WITH THEM AS WITH GOLD AND HAVE COMPELLED THEM TO STAY AT HOME WITH
THEM OR IF THE MASTER WOULD NOT STAY THEN THE DISCIPLES WOULD HAVE
FOLLOWED HIM ABOUT EVERYWHERE UNTIL THEY HAD GOT EDUCATION ENOUGH
YES SOCRATES THAT I THINK IS QUITE TRUE
THEN MUST WE NOT INFER THAT ALL THESE POETICAL INDIVIDUALS BEGINNING
WITH HOMER ARE ONLY IMITATORS THEY COPY IMAGES OF VIRTUE AND THE LIKE
BUT THE TRUTH THEY NEVER REACH THE POET IS LIKE A PAINTER WHO AS
WE HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED WILL MAKE A LIKENESS OF A COBBLER THOUGH HE
UNDERSTANDS NOTHING OF COBBLING AND HIS PICTURE IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR
THOSE WHO KNOW NO MORE THAN HE DOES AND JUDGE ONLY BY COLOURS AND
FIGURES
QUITE SO
IN LIKE MANNER THE POET WITH HIS WORDS AND PHRASES MAY BE SAID TO LAY ON
THE COLOURS OF THE SEVERAL ARTS HIMSELF UNDERSTANDING THEIR NATURE ONLY
ENOUGH TO IMITATE THEM AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE AS IGNORANT AS HE IS
AND JUDGE ONLY FROM HIS WORDS IMAGINE THAT IF HE SPEAKS OF COBBLING
OR OF MILITARY TACTICS OR OF ANYTHING ELSE IN METRE AND HARMONY AND
RHYTHM HE SPEAKS VERY WELL SUCH IS THE SWEET INFLUENCE WHICH MELODY
AND RHYTHM BY NATURE HAVE
AND I THINK THAT YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED AGAIN
AND AGAIN WHAT A POOR APPEARANCE THE TALES OF POETS MAKE WHEN STRIPPED
OF THE COLOURS WHICH MUSIC PUTS UPON THEM AND RECITED IN SIMPLE PROSE
YES HE SAID
THEY ARE LIKE FACES WHICH WERE NEVER REALLY BEAUTIFUL BUT ONLY
BLOOMING AND NOW THE BLOOM OF YOUTH HAS PASSED AWAY FROM THEM
EXACTLY
HERE IS ANOTHER POINT THE IMITATOR OR MAKER OF THE IMAGE KNOWS NOTHING
OF TRUE EXISTENCE HE KNOWS APPEARANCES ONLY
AM I NOT RIGHT
YES
THEN LET US HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AND NOT BE SATISFIED WITH HALF
AN EXPLANATION
PROCEED
OF THE PAINTER WE SAY THAT HE WILL PAINT REINS AND HE WILL PAINT A BIT
YES
AND THE WORKER IN LEATHER AND BRASS WILL MAKE THEM
CERTAINLY
BUT DOES THE PAINTER KNOW THE RIGHT FORM OF THE BIT AND REINS NAY
HARDLY EVEN THE WORKERS IN BRASS AND LEATHER WHO MAKE THEM ONLY THE
HORSEMAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE THEM HE KNOWS THEIR RIGHT FORM
MOST TRUE
AND MAY WE NOT SAY THE SAME OF ALL THINGS
WHAT
THAT THERE ARE THREE ARTS WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH ALL THINGS ONE WHICH
USES ANOTHER WHICH MAKES A THIRD WHICH IMITATES THEM
YES
AND THE EXCELLENCE OR BEAUTY OR TRUTH OF EVERY STRUCTURE ANIMATE OR
INANIMATE AND OF EVERY ACTION OF MAN IS RELATIVE TO THE USE FOR WHICH
NATURE OR THE ARTIST HAS INTENDED THEM
TRUE
THEN THE USER OF THEM MUST HAVE THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE OF THEM AND
HE MUST INDICATE TO THE MAKER THE GOOD OR BAD QUALITIES WHICH DEVELOP
THEMSELVES IN USE FOR EXAMPLE THE FLUTE PLAYER WILL TELL THE
FLUTE MAKER WHICH OF HIS FLUTES IS SATISFACTORY TO THE PERFORMER HE
WILL TELL HIM HOW HE OUGHT TO MAKE THEM AND THE OTHER WILL ATTEND TO
HIS INSTRUCTIONS
OF COURSE
THE ONE KNOWS AND THEREFORE SPEAKS WITH AUTHORITY ABOUT THE GOODNESS AND
BADNESS OF FLUTES WHILE THE OTHER CONFIDING IN HIM WILL DO WHAT HE IS
TOLD BY HIM
TRUE
THE INSTRUMENT IS THE SAME BUT ABOUT THE EXCELLENCE OR BADNESS OF IT
THE MAKER WILL ONLY ATTAIN TO A CORRECT BELIEF AND THIS HE WILL GAIN
FROM HIM WHO KNOWS BY TALKING TO HIM AND BEING COMPELLED TO HEAR WHAT
HE HAS TO SAY WHEREAS THE USER WILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE
TRUE
BUT WILL THE IMITATOR HAVE EITHER WILL HE KNOW FROM USE WHETHER OR NO
HIS DRAWING IS CORRECT OR BEAUTIFUL OR WILL HE HAVE RIGHT OPINION
FROM BEING COMPELLED TO ASSOCIATE WITH ANOTHER WHO KNOWS AND GIVES HIM
INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT WHAT HE SHOULD DRAW
NEITHER
THEN HE WILL NO MORE HAVE TRUE OPINION THAN HE WILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT
THE GOODNESS OR BADNESS OF HIS IMITATIONS
I SUPPOSE NOT
THE IMITATIVE ARTIST WILL BE IN A BRILLIANT STATE OF INTELLIGENCE ABOUT
HIS OWN CREATIONS
NAY VERY MUCH THE REVERSE
AND STILL HE WILL GO ON IMITATING WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT MAKES A THING
GOOD OR BAD AND MAY BE EXPECTED THEREFORE TO IMITATE ONLY THAT WHICH
APPEARS TO BE GOOD TO THE IGNORANT MULTITUDE
JUST SO
THUS FAR THEN WE ARE PRETTY WELL AGREED THAT THE IMITATOR HAS NO
KNOWLEDGE WORTH MENTIONING OF WHAT HE IMITATES
IMITATION IS ONLY A KIND
OF PLAY OR SPORT AND THE TRAGIC POETS WHETHER THEY WRITE IN IAMBIC OR
IN HEROIC VERSE ARE IMITATORS IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
VERY TRUE
AND NOW TELL ME I CONJURE YOU HAS NOT IMITATION BEEN SHOWN BY US TO BE
CONCERNED WITH THAT WHICH IS THRICE REMOVED FROM THE TRUTH
CERTAINLY
AND WHAT IS THE FACULTY IN MAN TO WHICH IMITATION IS ADDRESSED
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I WILL EXPLAIN THE BODY WHICH IS LARGE WHEN SEEN NEAR APPEARS SMALL
WHEN SEEN AT A DISTANCE
TRUE
AND THE SAME OBJECT APPEARS STRAIGHT WHEN LOOKED AT OUT OF THE WATER
AND CROOKED WHEN IN THE WATER AND THE CONCAVE BECOMES CONVEX OWING TO
THE ILLUSION ABOUT COLOURS TO WHICH THE SIGHT IS LIABLE
THUS EVERY SORT
OF CONFUSION IS REVEALED WITHIN US AND THIS IS THAT WEAKNESS OF THE
HUMAN MIND ON WHICH THE ART OF CONJURING AND OF DECEIVING BY LIGHT AND
SHADOW AND OTHER INGENIOUS DEVICES IMPOSES HAVING AN EFFECT UPON US
LIKE MAGIC
TRUE
AND THE ARTS OF MEASURING AND NUMBERING AND WEIGHING COME TO THE
RESCUE OF THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING THERE IS THE BEAUTY OF THEM AND THE
APPARENT GREATER OR LESS OR MORE OR HEAVIER NO LONGER HAVE THE MASTERY
OVER US BUT GIVE WAY BEFORE CALCULATION AND MEASURE AND WEIGHT
MOST TRUE
AND THIS SURELY MUST BE THE WORK OF THE CALCULATING AND RATIONAL
PRINCIPLE IN THE SOUL
TO BE SURE
AND WHEN THIS PRINCIPLE MEASURES AND CERTIFIES THAT SOME THINGS ARE
EQUAL OR THAT SOME ARE GREATER OR LESS THAN OTHERS THERE OCCURS AN
APPARENT CONTRADICTION
TRUE
BUT WERE WE NOT SAYING THAT SUCH A CONTRADICTION IS IMPOSSIBLE THE SAME
FACULTY CANNOT HAVE CONTRARY OPINIONS AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT THE SAME
THING
VERY TRUE
THEN THAT PART OF THE SOUL WHICH HAS AN OPINION CONTRARY TO MEASURE IS
NOT THE SAME WITH THAT WHICH HAS AN OPINION IN ACCORDANCE WITH MEASURE
TRUE
AND THE BETTER PART OF THE SOUL IS LIKELY TO BE THAT WHICH TRUSTS TO
MEASURE AND CALCULATION
CERTAINLY
AND THAT WHICH IS OPPOSED TO THEM IS ONE OF THE INFERIOR PRINCIPLES OF
THE SOUL
NO DOUBT
THIS WAS THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH I WAS SEEKING TO ARRIVE WHEN I SAID
THAT PAINTING OR DRAWING AND IMITATION IN GENERAL WHEN DOING THEIR OWN
PROPER WORK ARE FAR REMOVED FROM TRUTH AND THE COMPANIONS AND FRIENDS
AND ASSOCIATES OF A PRINCIPLE WITHIN US WHICH IS EQUALLY REMOVED FROM
REASON AND THAT THEY HAVE NO TRUE OR HEALTHY AIM
EXACTLY
THE IMITATIVE ART IS AN INFERIOR WHO MARRIES AN INFERIOR AND HAS
INFERIOR OFFSPRING
VERY TRUE
AND IS THIS CONFINED TO THE SIGHT ONLY OR DOES IT EXTEND TO THE HEARING
ALSO RELATING IN FACT TO WHAT WE TERM POETRY
PROBABLY THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE OF POETRY
DO NOT RELY I SAID ON A PROBABILITY DERIVED FROM THE ANALOGY OF
PAINTING BUT LET US EXAMINE FURTHER AND SEE WHETHER THE FACULTY WITH
WHICH POETICAL IMITATION IS CONCERNED IS GOOD OR BAD
BY ALL MEANS
WE MAY STATE THE QUESTION THUS IMITATION IMITATES THE ACTIONS OF MEN
WHETHER VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY ON WHICH AS THEY IMAGINE A GOOD OR
BAD RESULT HAS ENSUED AND THEY REJOICE OR SORROW ACCORDINGLY
IS THERE
ANYTHING MORE
NO THERE IS NOTHING ELSE
BUT IN ALL THIS VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS THE MAN AT UNITY WITH
HIMSELF OR RATHER AS IN THE INSTANCE OF SIGHT THERE WAS CONFUSION AND
OPPOSITION IN HIS OPINIONS ABOUT THE SAME THINGS SO HERE ALSO IS THERE
NOT STRIFE AND INCONSISTENCY IN HIS LIFE THOUGH I NEED HARDLY RAISE THE
QUESTION AGAIN FOR I REMEMBER THAT ALL THIS HAS BEEN ALREADY ADMITTED
AND THE SOUL HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY US TO BE FULL OF THESE AND TEN
THOUSAND SIMILAR OPPOSITIONS OCCURRING AT THE SAME MOMENT
AND WE WERE RIGHT HE SAID
YES I SAID THUS FAR WE WERE RIGHT BUT THERE WAS AN OMISSION WHICH
MUST NOW BE SUPPLIED
WHAT WAS THE OMISSION
WERE WE NOT SAYING THAT A GOOD MAN WHO HAS THE MISFORTUNE TO LOSE HIS
SON OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH IS MOST DEAR TO HIM WILL BEAR THE LOSS WITH
MORE EQUANIMITY THAN ANOTHER
YES
BUT WILL HE HAVE NO SORROW OR SHALL WE SAY THAT ALTHOUGH HE CANNOT HELP
SORROWING HE WILL MODERATE HIS SORROW
THE LATTER HE SAID IS THE TRUER STATEMENT
TELL ME WILL HE BE MORE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE AND HOLD OUT AGAINST HIS
SORROW WHEN HE IS SEEN BY HIS EQUALS OR WHEN HE IS ALONE
IT WILL MAKE A GREAT DIFFERENCE WHETHER HE IS SEEN OR NOT
WHEN HE IS BY HIMSELF HE WILL NOT MIND SAYING OR DOING MANY THINGS WHICH
HE WOULD BE ASHAMED OF ANY ONE HEARING OR SEEING HIM DO
TRUE
THERE IS A PRINCIPLE OF LAW AND REASON IN HIM WHICH BIDS HIM RESIST AS
WELL AS A FEELING OF HIS MISFORTUNE WHICH IS FORCING HIM TO INDULGE HIS
SORROW
TRUE
BUT WHEN A MAN IS DRAWN IN TWO OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS TO AND FROM THE SAME
OBJECT THIS AS WE AFFIRM NECESSARILY IMPLIES TWO DISTINCT PRINCIPLES
IN HIM
CERTAINLY
ONE OF THEM IS READY TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF THE LAW
HOW DO YOU MEAN
THE LAW WOULD SAY THAT TO BE PATIENT UNDER SUFFERING IS BEST AND THAT
WE SHOULD NOT GIVE WAY TO IMPATIENCE AS THERE IS NO KNOWING WHETHER
SUCH THINGS ARE GOOD OR EVIL AND NOTHING IS GAINED BY IMPATIENCE ALSO
BECAUSE NO HUMAN THING IS OF SERIOUS IMPORTANCE AND GRIEF STANDS IN THE
WAY OF THAT WHICH AT THE MOMENT IS MOST REQUIRED
WHAT IS MOST REQUIRED HE ASKED
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE COUNSEL ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHEN THE DICE
HAVE BEEN THROWN ORDER OUR AFFAIRS IN THE WAY WHICH REASON DEEMS BEST
NOT LIKE CHILDREN WHO HAVE HAD A FALL KEEPING HOLD OF THE PART STRUCK
AND WASTING TIME IN SETTING UP A HOWL BUT ALWAYS ACCUSTOMING THE SOUL
FORTHWITH TO APPLY A REMEDY RAISING UP THAT WHICH IS SICKLY AND FALLEN
BANISHING THE CRY OF SORROW BY THE HEALING ART
YES HE SAID THAT IS THE TRUE WAY OF MEETING THE ATTACKS OF FORTUNE
YES I SAID AND THE HIGHER PRINCIPLE IS READY TO FOLLOW THIS SUGGESTION
OF REASON
CLEARLY
AND THE OTHER PRINCIPLE WHICH INCLINES US TO RECOLLECTION OF OUR
TROUBLES AND TO LAMENTATION AND CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM WE MAY
CALL IRRATIONAL USELESS AND COWARDLY
INDEED WE MAY
AND DOES NOT THE LATTER I MEAN THE REBELLIOUS PRINCIPLE FURNISH A
GREAT VARIETY OF MATERIALS FOR IMITATION WHEREAS THE WISE AND CALM
TEMPERAMENT BEING ALWAYS NEARLY EQUABLE IS NOT EASY TO IMITATE OR
TO APPRECIATE WHEN IMITATED ESPECIALLY AT A PUBLIC FESTIVAL WHEN A
PROMISCUOUS CROWD IS ASSEMBLED IN A THEATRE
FOR THE FEELING REPRESENTED
IS ONE TO WHICH THEY ARE STRANGERS
CERTAINLY
THEN THE IMITATIVE POET WHO AIMS AT BEING POPULAR IS NOT BY NATURE MADE
NOR IS HIS ART INTENDED TO PLEASE OR TO AFFECT THE RATIONAL PRINCIPLE
IN THE SOUL BUT HE WILL PREFER THE PASSIONATE AND FITFUL TEMPER WHICH
IS EASILY IMITATED
CLEARLY
AND NOW WE MAY FAIRLY TAKE HIM AND PLACE HIM BY THE SIDE OF THE PAINTER
FOR HE IS LIKE HIM IN TWO WAYS FIRST INASMUCH AS HIS CREATIONS HAVE AN
INFERIOR DEGREE OF TRUTH IN THIS I SAY HE IS LIKE HIM AND HE IS
ALSO LIKE HIM IN BEING CONCERNED WITH AN INFERIOR PART OF THE SOUL AND
THEREFORE WE SHALL BE RIGHT IN REFUSING TO ADMIT HIM INTO A WELL ORDERED
STATE BECAUSE HE AWAKENS AND NOURISHES AND STRENGTHENS THE FEELINGS
AND IMPAIRS THE REASON
AS IN A CITY WHEN THE EVIL ARE PERMITTED TO HAVE
AUTHORITY AND THE GOOD ARE PUT OUT OF THE WAY SO IN THE SOUL OF MAN
AS WE MAINTAIN THE IMITATIVE POET IMPLANTS AN EVIL CONSTITUTION FOR HE
INDULGES THE IRRATIONAL NATURE WHICH HAS NO DISCERNMENT OF GREATER
AND LESS BUT THINKS THE SAME THING AT ONE TIME GREAT AND AT ANOTHER
SMALL HE IS A MANUFACTURER OF IMAGES AND IS VERY FAR REMOVED FROM THE
TRUTH
EXACTLY
BUT WE HAVE NOT YET BROUGHT FORWARD THE HEAVIEST COUNT IN OUR
ACCUSATION THE POWER WHICH POETRY HAS OF HARMING EVEN THE GOOD AND
THERE ARE VERY FEW WHO ARE NOT HARMED IS SURELY AN AWFUL THING
YES CERTAINLY IF THE EFFECT IS WHAT YOU SAY
HEAR AND JUDGE THE BEST OF US AS I CONCEIVE WHEN WE LISTEN TO A
PASSAGE OF HOMER OR ONE OF THE TRAGEDIANS IN WHICH HE REPRESENTS
SOME PITIFUL HERO WHO IS DRAWLING OUT HIS SORROWS IN A LONG ORATION OR
WEEPING AND SMITING HIS BREAST THE BEST OF US YOU KNOW DELIGHT IN
GIVING WAY TO SYMPATHY AND ARE IN RAPTURES AT THE EXCELLENCE OF THE
POET WHO STIRS OUR FEELINGS MOST
YES OF COURSE I KNOW
BUT WHEN ANY SORROW OF OUR OWN HAPPENS TO US THEN YOU MAY OBSERVE THAT
WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON THE OPPOSITE QUALITY WE WOULD FAIN BE QUIET AND
PATIENT THIS IS THE MANLY PART AND THE OTHER WHICH DELIGHTED US IN THE
RECITATION IS NOW DEEMED TO BE THE PART OF A WOMAN
VERY TRUE HE SAID
NOW CAN WE BE RIGHT IN PRAISING AND ADMIRING ANOTHER WHO IS DOING THAT
WHICH ANY ONE OF US WOULD ABOMINATE AND BE ASHAMED OF IN HIS OWN PERSON
NO HE SAID THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT REASONABLE
NAY I SAID QUITE REASONABLE FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW
WHAT POINT OF VIEW
IF YOU CONSIDER I SAID THAT WHEN IN MISFORTUNE WE FEEL A NATURAL
HUNGER AND DESIRE TO RELIEVE OUR SORROW BY WEEPING AND LAMENTATION AND
THAT THIS FEELING WHICH IS KEPT UNDER CONTROL IN OUR OWN CALAMITIES IS
SATISFIED AND DELIGHTED BY THE POETS THE BETTER NATURE IN EACH OF
US NOT HAVING BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TRAINED BY REASON OR HABIT ALLOWS THE
SYMPATHETIC ELEMENT TO BREAK LOOSE BECAUSE THE SORROW IS ANOTHER'S
AND THE SPECTATOR FANCIES THAT THERE CAN BE NO DISGRACE TO HIMSELF IN
PRAISING AND PITYING ANY ONE WHO COMES TELLING HIM WHAT A GOOD MAN HE
IS AND MAKING A FUSS ABOUT HIS TROUBLES HE THINKS THAT THE PLEASURE
IS A GAIN AND WHY SHOULD HE BE SUPERCILIOUS AND LOSE THIS AND THE POEM
TOO FEW PERSONS EVER REFLECT AS I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT FROM THE EVIL
OF OTHER MEN SOMETHING OF EVIL IS COMMUNICATED TO THEMSELVES
AND SO
THE FEELING OF SORROW WHICH HAS GATHERED STRENGTH AT THE SIGHT OF THE
MISFORTUNES OF OTHERS IS WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED IN OUR OWN
HOW VERY TRUE
AND DOES NOT THE SAME HOLD ALSO OF THE RIDICULOUS THERE ARE JESTS WHICH
YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED TO MAKE YOURSELF AND YET ON THE COMIC STAGE OR
INDEED IN PRIVATE WHEN YOU HEAR THEM YOU ARE GREATLY AMUSED BY THEM
AND ARE NOT AT ALL DISGUSTED AT THEIR UNSEEMLINESS THE CASE OF PITY
IS REPEATED THERE IS A PRINCIPLE IN HUMAN NATURE WHICH IS DISPOSED TO
RAISE A LAUGH AND THIS WHICH YOU ONCE RESTRAINED BY REASON BECAUSE YOU
WERE AFRAID OF BEING THOUGHT A BUFFOON IS NOW LET OUT AGAIN AND
HAVING STIMULATED THE RISIBLE FACULTY AT THE THEATRE YOU ARE BETRAYED
UNCONSCIOUSLY TO YOURSELF INTO PLAYING THE COMIC POET AT HOME
QUITE TRUE HE SAID
AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF LUST AND ANGER AND ALL THE OTHER AFFECTIONS
OF DESIRE AND PAIN AND PLEASURE WHICH ARE HELD TO BE INSEPARABLE
FROM EVERY ACTION IN ALL OF THEM POETRY FEEDS AND WATERS THE PASSIONS
INSTEAD OF DRYING THEM UP SHE LETS THEM RULE ALTHOUGH THEY OUGHT TO BE
CONTROLLED IF MANKIND ARE EVER TO INCREASE IN HAPPINESS AND VIRTUE
I CANNOT DENY IT
THEREFORE GLAUCON I SAID WHENEVER YOU MEET WITH ANY OF THE EULOGISTS
OF HOMER DECLARING THAT HE HAS BEEN THE EDUCATOR OF HELLAS AND THAT HE
IS PROFITABLE FOR EDUCATION AND FOR THE ORDERING OF HUMAN THINGS AND
THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE HIM UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND GET TO KNOW HIM AND
REGULATE YOUR WHOLE LIFE ACCORDING TO HIM WE MAY LOVE AND HONOUR THOSE
WHO SAY THESE THINGS THEY ARE EXCELLENT PEOPLE AS FAR AS THEIR LIGHTS
EXTEND AND WE ARE READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HOMER IS THE GREATEST
OF POETS AND FIRST OF TRAGEDY WRITERS BUT WE MUST REMAIN FIRM IN OUR
CONVICTION THAT HYMNS TO THE GODS AND PRAISES OF FAMOUS MEN ARE THE ONLY
POETRY WHICH OUGHT TO BE ADMITTED INTO OUR STATE
FOR IF YOU GO BEYOND
THIS AND ALLOW THE HONEYED MUSE TO ENTER EITHER IN EPIC OR LYRIC VERSE
NOT LAW AND THE REASON OF MANKIND WHICH BY COMMON CONSENT HAVE EVER
BEEN DEEMED BEST BUT PLEASURE AND PAIN WILL BE THE RULERS IN OUR STATE
THAT IS MOST TRUE HE SAID
AND NOW SINCE WE HAVE REVERTED TO THE SUBJECT OF POETRY LET THIS OUR
DEFENCE SERVE TO SHOW THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR FORMER JUDGMENT IN
SENDING AWAY OUT OF OUR STATE AN ART HAVING THE TENDENCIES WHICH WE HAVE
DESCRIBED FOR REASON CONSTRAINED US
BUT THAT SHE MAY NOT IMPUTE TO US
ANY HARSHNESS OR WANT OF POLITENESS LET US TELL HER THAT THERE IS AN
ANCIENT QUARREL BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY
PROOFS SUCH AS THE SAYING OF 'THE YELPING HOUND HOWLING AT HER LORD
OR OF ONE 'MIGHTY IN THE VAIN TALK OF FOOLS AND 'THE MOB OF SAGES
CIRCUMVENTING ZEUS AND THE 'SUBTLE THINKERS WHO ARE BEGGARS AFTER
ALL' AND THERE ARE INNUMERABLE OTHER SIGNS OF ANCIENT ENMITY BETWEEN
THEM
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS LET US ASSURE OUR SWEET FRIEND AND THE
SISTER ARTS OF IMITATION THAT IF SHE WILL ONLY PROVE HER TITLE TO EXIST
IN A WELL ORDERED STATE WE SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE HER WE ARE
VERY CONSCIOUS OF HER CHARMS BUT WE MAY NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT BETRAY THE
TRUTH
I DARE SAY GLAUCON THAT YOU ARE AS MUCH CHARMED BY HER AS I AM
ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE APPEARS IN HOMER
YES INDEED I AM GREATLY CHARMED
SHALL I PROPOSE THEN THAT SHE BE ALLOWED TO RETURN FROM EXILE BUT
UPON THIS CONDITION ONLY THAT SHE MAKE A DEFENCE OF HERSELF IN LYRICAL
OR SOME OTHER METRE
CERTAINLY
AND WE MAY FURTHER GRANT TO THOSE OF HER DEFENDERS WHO ARE LOVERS OF
POETRY AND YET NOT POETS THE PERMISSION TO SPEAK IN PROSE ON HER BEHALF
LET THEM SHOW NOT ONLY THAT SHE IS PLEASANT BUT ALSO USEFUL TO STATES
AND TO HUMAN LIFE AND WE WILL LISTEN IN A KINDLY SPIRIT FOR IF THIS
CAN BE PROVED WE SHALL SURELY BE THE GAINERS I MEAN IF THERE IS A USE
IN POETRY AS WELL AS A DELIGHT
CERTAINLY HE SAID WE SHALL BE THE GAINERS
IF HER DEFENCE FAILS THEN MY DEAR FRIEND LIKE OTHER PERSONS WHO ARE
ENAMOURED OF SOMETHING BUT PUT A RESTRAINT UPON THEMSELVES WHEN THEY
THINK THEIR DESIRES ARE OPPOSED TO THEIR INTERESTS SO TOO MUST WE AFTER
THE MANNER OF LOVERS GIVE HER UP THOUGH NOT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
WE TOO
ARE INSPIRED BY THAT LOVE OF POETRY WHICH THE EDUCATION OF NOBLE STATES
HAS IMPLANTED IN US AND THEREFORE WE WOULD HAVE HER APPEAR AT HER BEST
AND TRUEST BUT SO LONG AS SHE IS UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD HER DEFENCE
THIS ARGUMENT OF OURS SHALL BE A CHARM TO US WHICH WE WILL REPEAT TO
OURSELVES WHILE WE LISTEN TO HER STRAINS THAT WE MAY NOT FALL AWAY INTO
THE CHILDISH LOVE OF HER WHICH CAPTIVATES THE MANY
AT ALL EVENTS WE
ARE WELL AWARE THAT POETRY BEING SUCH AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED IS NOT TO BE
REGARDED SERIOUSLY AS ATTAINING TO THE TRUTH AND HE WHO LISTENS TO HER
FEARING FOR THE SAFETY OF THE CITY WHICH IS WITHIN HIM SHOULD BE ON HIS
GUARD AGAINST HER SEDUCTIONS AND MAKE OUR WORDS HIS LAW
YES HE SAID I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU
YES I SAID MY DEAR GLAUCON FOR GREAT IS THE ISSUE AT STAKE GREATER
THAN APPEARS WHETHER A MAN IS TO BE GOOD OR BAD
AND WHAT WILL ANY ONE
BE PROFITED IF UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HONOUR OR MONEY OR POWER AYE OR
UNDER THE EXCITEMENT OF POETRY HE NEGLECT JUSTICE AND VIRTUE
YES HE SAID I HAVE BEEN CONVINCED BY THE ARGUMENT AS I BELIEVE THAT
ANY ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN
AND YET NO MENTION HAS BEEN MADE OF THE GREATEST PRIZES AND REWARDS
WHICH AWAIT VIRTUE
WHAT ARE THERE ANY GREATER STILL IF THERE ARE THEY MUST BE OF AN
INCONCEIVABLE GREATNESS
WHY I SAID WHAT WAS EVER GREAT IN A SHORT TIME THE WHOLE PERIOD OF
THREE SCORE YEARS AND TEN IS SURELY BUT A LITTLE THING IN COMPARISON
WITH ETERNITY
SAY RATHER 'NOTHING HE REPLIED
AND SHOULD AN IMMORTAL BEING SERIOUSLY THINK OF THIS LITTLE SPACE RATHER
THAN OF THE WHOLE
OF THE WHOLE CERTAINLY
BUT WHY DO YOU ASK
ARE YOU NOT AWARE I SAID THAT THE SOUL OF MAN IS IMMORTAL AND
IMPERISHABLE
HE LOOKED AT ME IN ASTONISHMENT AND SAID NO BY HEAVEN AND ARE YOU
REALLY PREPARED TO MAINTAIN THIS
YES I SAID I OUGHT TO BE AND YOU TOO THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN
PROVING IT
I SEE A GREAT DIFFICULTY BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOU STATE THIS
ARGUMENT OF WHICH YOU MAKE SO LIGHT
LISTEN THEN
I AM ATTENDING
THERE IS A THING WHICH YOU CALL GOOD AND ANOTHER WHICH YOU CALL EVIL
YES HE REPLIED
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING THAT THE CORRUPTING AND DESTROYING
ELEMENT IS THE EVIL AND THE SAVING AND IMPROVING ELEMENT THE GOOD
YES
AND YOU ADMIT THAT EVERY THING HAS A GOOD AND ALSO AN EVIL AS
OPHTHALMIA IS THE EVIL OF THE EYES AND DISEASE OF THE WHOLE BODY AS
MILDEW IS OF CORN AND ROT OF TIMBER OR RUST OF COPPER AND IRON IN
EVERYTHING OR IN ALMOST EVERYTHING THERE IS AN INHERENT EVIL AND
DISEASE
YES HE SAID
AND ANYTHING WHICH IS INFECTED BY ANY OF THESE EVILS IS MADE EVIL AND
AT LAST WHOLLY DISSOLVES AND DIES
TRUE
THE VICE AND EVIL WHICH IS INHERENT IN EACH IS THE DESTRUCTION OF EACH
AND IF THIS DOES NOT DESTROY THEM THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT WILL FOR
GOOD CERTAINLY WILL NOT DESTROY THEM NOR AGAIN THAT WHICH IS NEITHER
GOOD NOR EVIL
CERTAINLY NOT
IF THEN WE FIND ANY NATURE WHICH HAVING THIS INHERENT CORRUPTION
CANNOT BE DISSOLVED OR DESTROYED WE MAY BE CERTAIN THAT OF SUCH A
NATURE THERE IS NO DESTRUCTION
THAT MAY BE ASSUMED
WELL I SAID AND IS THERE NO EVIL WHICH CORRUPTS THE SOUL
YES HE SAID THERE ARE ALL THE EVILS WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW PASSING IN
REVIEW UNRIGHTEOUSNESS INTEMPERANCE COWARDICE IGNORANCE
BUT DOES ANY OF THESE DISSOLVE OR DESTROY HER AND HERE DO NOT LET US
FALL INTO THE ERROR OF SUPPOSING THAT THE UNJUST AND FOOLISH MAN WHEN
HE IS DETECTED PERISHES THROUGH HIS OWN INJUSTICE WHICH IS AN EVIL
OF THE SOUL
TAKE THE ANALOGY OF THE BODY THE EVIL OF THE BODY IS A
DISEASE WHICH WASTES AND REDUCES AND ANNIHILATES THE BODY AND ALL THE
THINGS OF WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW SPEAKING COME TO ANNIHILATION THROUGH
THEIR OWN CORRUPTION ATTACHING TO THEM AND INHERING IN THEM AND SO
DESTROYING THEM
IS NOT THIS TRUE
YES
CONSIDER THE SOUL IN LIKE MANNER
DOES THE INJUSTICE OR OTHER EVIL WHICH
EXISTS IN THE SOUL WASTE AND CONSUME HER DO THEY BY ATTACHING TO THE
SOUL AND INHERING IN HER AT LAST BRING HER TO DEATH AND SO SEPARATE HER
FROM THE BODY
CERTAINLY NOT
AND YET I SAID IT IS UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT ANYTHING CAN PERISH
FROM WITHOUT THROUGH AFFECTION OF EXTERNAL EVIL WHICH COULD NOT BE
DESTROYED FROM WITHIN BY A CORRUPTION OF ITS OWN
IT IS HE REPLIED
CONSIDER I SAID GLAUCON THAT EVEN THE BADNESS OF FOOD WHETHER
STALENESS DECOMPOSITION OR ANY OTHER BAD QUALITY WHEN CONFINED TO
THE ACTUAL FOOD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO DESTROY THE BODY ALTHOUGH IF THE
BADNESS OF FOOD COMMUNICATES CORRUPTION TO THE BODY THEN WE SHOULD SAY
THAT THE BODY HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY A CORRUPTION OF ITSELF WHICH IS
DISEASE BROUGHT ON BY THIS BUT THAT THE BODY BEING ONE THING CAN BE
DESTROYED BY THE BADNESS OF FOOD WHICH IS ANOTHER AND WHICH DOES NOT
ENGENDER ANY NATURAL INFECTION THIS WE SHALL ABSOLUTELY DENY
VERY TRUE
AND ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE UNLESS SOME BODILY EVIL CAN PRODUCE AN EVIL
OF THE SOUL WE MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT THE SOUL WHICH IS ONE THING CAN
BE DISSOLVED BY ANY MERELY EXTERNAL EVIL WHICH BELONGS TO ANOTHER
YES HE SAID THERE IS REASON IN THAT
EITHER THEN LET US REFUTE THIS CONCLUSION OR WHILE IT REMAINS
UNREFUTED LET US NEVER SAY THAT FEVER OR ANY OTHER DISEASE OR THE
KNIFE PUT TO THE THROAT OR EVEN THE CUTTING UP OF THE WHOLE BODY INTO
THE MINUTEST PIECES CAN DESTROY THE SOUL UNTIL SHE HERSELF IS PROVED
TO BECOME MORE UNHOLY OR UNRIGHTEOUS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THESE THINGS
BEING DONE TO THE BODY BUT THAT THE SOUL OR ANYTHING ELSE IF NOT
DESTROYED BY AN INTERNAL EVIL CAN BE DESTROYED BY AN EXTERNAL ONE IS
NOT TO BE AFFIRMED BY ANY MAN
AND SURELY HE REPLIED NO ONE WILL EVER PROVE THAT THE SOULS OF MEN
BECOME MORE UNJUST IN CONSEQUENCE OF DEATH
BUT IF SOME ONE WHO WOULD RATHER NOT ADMIT THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL
BOLDLY DENIES THIS AND SAYS THAT THE DYING DO REALLY BECOME MORE
EVIL AND UNRIGHTEOUS THEN IF THE SPEAKER IS RIGHT I SUPPOSE THAT
INJUSTICE LIKE DISEASE MUST BE ASSUMED TO BE FATAL TO THE UNJUST AND
THAT THOSE WHO TAKE THIS DISORDER DIE BY THE NATURAL INHERENT POWER OF
DESTRUCTION WHICH EVIL HAS AND WHICH KILLS THEM SOONER OR LATER BUT
IN QUITE ANOTHER WAY FROM THAT IN WHICH AT PRESENT THE WICKED RECEIVE
DEATH AT THE HANDS OF OTHERS AS THE PENALTY OF THEIR DEEDS
NAY HE SAID IN THAT CASE INJUSTICE IF FATAL TO THE UNJUST WILL NOT
BE SO VERY TERRIBLE TO HIM FOR HE WILL BE DELIVERED FROM EVIL
BUT I
RATHER SUSPECT THE OPPOSITE TO BE THE TRUTH AND THAT INJUSTICE WHICH
IF IT HAVE THE POWER WILL MURDER OTHERS KEEPS THE MURDERER ALIVE AYE
AND WELL AWAKE TOO SO FAR REMOVED IS HER DWELLING PLACE FROM BEING A
HOUSE OF DEATH
TRUE I SAID IF THE INHERENT NATURAL VICE OR EVIL OF THE SOUL IS UNABLE
TO KILL OR DESTROY HER HARDLY WILL THAT WHICH IS APPOINTED TO BE THE
DESTRUCTION OF SOME OTHER BODY DESTROY A SOUL OR ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT
THAT OF WHICH IT WAS APPOINTED TO BE THE DESTRUCTION
YES THAT CAN HARDLY BE
BUT THE SOUL WHICH CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY AN EVIL WHETHER INHERENT
OR EXTERNAL MUST EXIST FOR EVER AND IF EXISTING FOR EVER MUST BE
IMMORTAL
CERTAINLY
THAT IS THE CONCLUSION I SAID AND IF A TRUE CONCLUSION THEN THE
SOULS MUST ALWAYS BE THE SAME FOR IF NONE BE DESTROYED THEY WILL NOT
DIMINISH IN NUMBER
NEITHER WILL THEY INCREASE FOR THE INCREASE OF THE
IMMORTAL NATURES MUST COME FROM SOMETHING MORTAL AND ALL THINGS WOULD
THUS END IN IMMORTALITY
VERY TRUE
BUT THIS WE CANNOT BELIEVE REASON WILL NOT ALLOW US ANY MORE THAN WE
CAN BELIEVE THE SOUL IN HER TRUEST NATURE TO BE FULL OF VARIETY AND
DIFFERENCE AND DISSIMILARITY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
THE SOUL I SAID BEING AS IS NOW PROVEN IMMORTAL MUST BE THE FAIREST
OF COMPOSITIONS AND CANNOT BE COMPOUNDED OF MANY ELEMENTS
CERTAINLY NOT
HER IMMORTALITY IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PREVIOUS ARGUMENT AND THERE ARE
MANY OTHER PROOFS BUT TO SEE HER AS SHE REALLY IS NOT AS WE NOW BEHOLD
HER MARRED BY COMMUNION WITH THE BODY AND OTHER MISERIES YOU MUST
CONTEMPLATE HER WITH THE EYE OF REASON IN HER ORIGINAL PURITY AND
THEN HER BEAUTY WILL BE REVEALED AND JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE AND ALL THE
THINGS WHICH WE HAVE DESCRIBED WILL BE MANIFESTED MORE CLEARLY
THUS
FAR WE HAVE SPOKEN THE TRUTH CONCERNING HER AS SHE APPEARS AT PRESENT
BUT WE MUST REMEMBER ALSO THAT WE HAVE SEEN HER ONLY IN A CONDITION
WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF THE SEA GOD GLAUCUS WHOSE ORIGINAL
IMAGE CAN HARDLY BE DISCERNED BECAUSE HIS NATURAL MEMBERS ARE BROKEN
OFF AND CRUSHED AND DAMAGED BY THE WAVES IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS AND
INCRUSTATIONS HAVE GROWN OVER THEM OF SEAWEED AND SHELLS AND STONES SO
THAT HE IS MORE LIKE SOME MONSTER THAN HE IS TO HIS OWN NATURAL FORM
AND THE SOUL WHICH WE BEHOLD IS IN A SIMILAR CONDITION DISFIGURED BY
TEN THOUSAND ILLS
BUT NOT THERE GLAUCON NOT THERE MUST WE LOOK
WHERE THEN
AT HER LOVE OF WISDOM
LET US SEE WHOM SHE AFFECTS AND WHAT SOCIETY AND
CONVERSE SHE SEEKS IN VIRTUE OF HER NEAR KINDRED WITH THE IMMORTAL
AND ETERNAL AND DIVINE ALSO HOW DIFFERENT SHE WOULD BECOME IF WHOLLY
FOLLOWING THIS SUPERIOR PRINCIPLE AND BORNE BY A DIVINE IMPULSE OUT OF
THE OCEAN IN WHICH SHE NOW IS AND DISENGAGED FROM THE STONES AND SHELLS
AND THINGS OF EARTH AND ROCK WHICH IN WILD VARIETY SPRING UP AROUND HER
BECAUSE SHE FEEDS UPON EARTH AND IS OVERGROWN BY THE GOOD THINGS OF
THIS LIFE AS THEY ARE TERMED THEN YOU WOULD SEE HER AS SHE IS AND KNOW
WHETHER SHE HAVE ONE SHAPE ONLY OR MANY OR WHAT HER NATURE IS
OF HER
AFFECTIONS AND OF THE FORMS WHICH SHE TAKES IN THIS PRESENT LIFE I THINK
THAT WE HAVE NOW SAID ENOUGH
TRUE HE REPLIED
AND THUS I SAID WE HAVE FULFILLED THE CONDITIONS OF THE ARGUMENT WE
HAVE NOT INTRODUCED THE REWARDS AND GLORIES OF JUSTICE WHICH AS YOU
WERE SAYING ARE TO BE FOUND IN HOMER AND HESIOD BUT JUSTICE IN HER OWN
NATURE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE BEST FOR THE SOUL IN HER OWN NATURE
LET A
MAN DO WHAT IS JUST WHETHER HE HAVE THE RING OF GYGES OR NOT AND EVEN
IF IN ADDITION TO THE RING OF GYGES HE PUT ON THE HELMET OF HADES
VERY TRUE
AND NOW GLAUCON THERE WILL BE NO HARM IN FURTHER ENUMERATING HOW
MANY AND HOW GREAT ARE THE REWARDS WHICH JUSTICE AND THE OTHER VIRTUES
PROCURE TO THE SOUL FROM GODS AND MEN BOTH IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH
CERTAINLY NOT HE SAID
WILL YOU REPAY ME THEN WHAT YOU BORROWED IN THE ARGUMENT
WHAT DID I BORROW
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE JUST MAN SHOULD APPEAR UNJUST AND THE UNJUST
JUST FOR YOU WERE OF OPINION THAT EVEN IF THE TRUE STATE OF THE CASE
COULD NOT POSSIBLY ESCAPE THE EYES OF GODS AND MEN STILL THIS ADMISSION
OUGHT TO BE MADE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ARGUMENT IN ORDER THAT PURE
JUSTICE MIGHT BE WEIGHED AGAINST PURE INJUSTICE
DO YOU REMEMBER
I SHOULD BE MUCH TO BLAME IF I HAD FORGOTTEN
THEN AS THE CAUSE IS DECIDED I DEMAND ON BEHALF OF JUSTICE THAT THE
ESTIMATION IN WHICH SHE IS HELD BY GODS AND MEN AND WHICH WE ACKNOWLEDGE
TO BE HER DUE SHOULD NOW BE RESTORED TO HER BY US SINCE SHE HAS BEEN
SHOWN TO CONFER REALITY AND NOT TO DECEIVE THOSE WHO TRULY POSSESS HER
LET WHAT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM HER BE GIVEN BACK THAT SO SHE MAY WIN THAT
PALM OF APPEARANCE WHICH IS HERS ALSO AND WHICH SHE GIVES TO HER OWN
THE DEMAND HE SAID IS JUST
IN THE FIRST PLACE I SAID AND THIS IS THE FIRST THING WHICH YOU WILL
HAVE TO GIVE BACK THE NATURE BOTH OF THE JUST AND UNJUST IS TRULY KNOWN
TO THE GODS
GRANTED
AND IF THEY ARE BOTH KNOWN TO THEM ONE MUST BE THE FRIEND AND THE OTHER
THE ENEMY OF THE GODS AS WE ADMITTED FROM THE BEGINNING
TRUE
AND THE FRIEND OF THE GODS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE FROM THEM ALL
THINGS AT THEIR BEST EXCEPTING ONLY SUCH EVIL AS IS THE NECESSARY
CONSEQUENCE OF FORMER SINS
CERTAINLY
THEN THIS MUST BE OUR NOTION OF THE JUST MAN THAT EVEN WHEN HE IS IN
POVERTY OR SICKNESS OR ANY OTHER SEEMING MISFORTUNE ALL THINGS WILL
IN THE END WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD TO HIM IN LIFE AND DEATH FOR THE GODS
HAVE A CARE OF ANY ONE WHOSE DESIRE IS TO BECOME JUST AND TO BE LIKE
GOD AS FAR AS MAN CAN ATTAIN THE DIVINE LIKENESS BY THE PURSUIT OF
VIRTUE
YES HE SAID IF HE IS LIKE GOD HE WILL SURELY NOT BE NEGLECTED BY HIM
AND OF THE UNJUST MAY NOT THE OPPOSITE BE SUPPOSED
CERTAINLY
SUCH THEN ARE THE PALMS OF VICTORY WHICH THE GODS GIVE THE JUST
THAT IS MY CONVICTION
AND WHAT DO THEY RECEIVE OF MEN LOOK AT THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE AND
YOU WILL SEE THAT THE CLEVER UNJUST ARE IN THE CASE OF RUNNERS WHO RUN
WELL FROM THE STARTING PLACE TO THE GOAL BUT NOT BACK AGAIN FROM THE
GOAL THEY GO OFF AT A GREAT PACE BUT IN THE END ONLY LOOK FOOLISH
SLINKING AWAY WITH THEIR EARS DRAGGLING ON THEIR SHOULDERS AND WITHOUT
A CROWN BUT THE TRUE RUNNER COMES TO THE FINISH AND RECEIVES THE PRIZE
AND IS CROWNED
AND THIS IS THE WAY WITH THE JUST HE WHO ENDURES TO THE
END OF EVERY ACTION AND OCCASION OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE HAS A GOOD REPORT
AND CARRIES OFF THE PRIZE WHICH MEN HAVE TO BESTOW
TRUE
AND NOW YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO REPEAT OF THE JUST THE BLESSINGS WHICH YOU
WERE ATTRIBUTING TO THE FORTUNATE UNJUST
I SHALL SAY OF THEM WHAT YOU
WERE SAYING OF THE OTHERS THAT AS THEY GROW OLDER THEY BECOME RULERS
IN THEIR OWN CITY IF THEY CARE TO BE THEY MARRY WHOM THEY LIKE AND GIVE
IN MARRIAGE TO WHOM THEY WILL ALL THAT YOU SAID OF THE OTHERS I NOW SAY
OF THESE
AND ON THE OTHER HAND OF THE UNJUST I SAY THAT THE GREATER
NUMBER EVEN THOUGH THEY ESCAPE IN THEIR YOUTH ARE FOUND OUT AT LAST
AND LOOK FOOLISH AT THE END OF THEIR COURSE AND WHEN THEY COME TO BE
OLD AND MISERABLE ARE FLOUTED ALIKE BY STRANGER AND CITIZEN THEY ARE
BEATEN AND THEN COME THOSE THINGS UNFIT FOR EARS POLITE AS YOU TRULY
TERM THEM THEY WILL BE RACKED AND HAVE THEIR EYES BURNED OUT AS YOU
WERE SAYING
AND YOU MAY SUPPOSE THAT I HAVE REPEATED THE REMAINDER OF
YOUR TALE OF HORRORS
BUT WILL YOU LET ME ASSUME WITHOUT RECITING THEM
THAT THESE THINGS ARE TRUE
CERTAINLY HE SAID WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE
THESE THEN ARE THE PRIZES AND REWARDS AND GIFTS WHICH ARE BESTOWED
UPON THE JUST BY GODS AND MEN IN THIS PRESENT LIFE IN ADDITION TO THE
OTHER GOOD THINGS WHICH JUSTICE OF HERSELF PROVIDES
YES HE SAID AND THEY ARE FAIR AND LASTING
AND YET I SAID ALL THESE ARE AS NOTHING EITHER IN NUMBER OR GREATNESS
IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE OTHER RECOMPENSES WHICH AWAIT BOTH JUST AND
UNJUST AFTER DEATH
AND YOU OUGHT TO HEAR THEM AND THEN BOTH JUST AND
UNJUST WILL HAVE RECEIVED FROM US A FULL PAYMENT OF THE DEBT WHICH THE
ARGUMENT OWES TO THEM
SPEAK HE SAID THERE ARE FEW THINGS WHICH I WOULD MORE GLADLY HEAR
WELL I SAID I WILL TELL YOU A TALE NOT ONE OF THE TALES WHICH
ODYSSEUS TELLS TO THE HERO ALCINOUS YET THIS TOO IS A TALE OF A HERO
ER THE SON OF ARMENIUS A PAMPHYLIAN BY BIRTH
HE WAS SLAIN IN BATTLE
AND TEN DAYS AFTERWARDS WHEN THE BODIES OF THE DEAD WERE TAKEN UP
ALREADY IN A STATE OF CORRUPTION HIS BODY WAS FOUND UNAFFECTED BY
DECAY AND CARRIED AWAY HOME TO BE BURIED
AND ON THE TWELFTH DAY AS HE
WAS LYING ON THE FUNERAL PILE HE RETURNED TO LIFE AND TOLD THEM WHAT HE
HAD SEEN IN THE OTHER WORLD
HE SAID THAT WHEN HIS SOUL LEFT THE BODY
HE WENT ON A JOURNEY WITH A GREAT COMPANY AND THAT THEY CAME TO A
MYSTERIOUS PLACE AT WHICH THERE WERE TWO OPENINGS IN THE EARTH THEY
WERE NEAR TOGETHER AND OVER AGAINST THEM WERE TWO OTHER OPENINGS IN THE
HEAVEN ABOVE
IN THE INTERMEDIATE SPACE THERE WERE JUDGES SEATED WHO
COMMANDED THE JUST AFTER THEY HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT ON THEM AND HAD BOUND
THEIR SENTENCES IN FRONT OF THEM TO ASCEND BY THE HEAVENLY WAY ON THE
RIGHT HAND AND IN LIKE MANNER THE UNJUST WERE BIDDEN BY THEM TO DESCEND
BY THE LOWER WAY ON THE LEFT HAND THESE ALSO BORE THE SYMBOLS OF THEIR
DEEDS BUT FASTENED ON THEIR BACKS
HE DREW NEAR AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT
HE WAS TO BE THE MESSENGER WHO WOULD CARRY THE REPORT OF THE OTHER WORLD
TO MEN AND THEY BADE HIM HEAR AND SEE ALL THAT WAS TO BE HEARD AND SEEN
IN THAT PLACE
THEN HE BEHELD AND SAW ON ONE SIDE THE SOULS DEPARTING AT
EITHER OPENING OF HEAVEN AND EARTH WHEN SENTENCE HAD BEEN GIVEN ON THEM
AND AT THE TWO OTHER OPENINGS OTHER SOULS SOME ASCENDING OUT OF THE
EARTH DUSTY AND WORN WITH TRAVEL SOME DESCENDING OUT OF HEAVEN CLEAN
AND BRIGHT
AND ARRIVING EVER AND ANON THEY SEEMED TO HAVE COME FROM A
LONG JOURNEY AND THEY WENT FORTH WITH GLADNESS INTO THE MEADOW WHERE
THEY ENCAMPED AS AT A FESTIVAL AND THOSE WHO KNEW ONE ANOTHER EMBRACED
AND CONVERSED THE SOULS WHICH CAME FROM EARTH CURIOUSLY ENQUIRING ABOUT
THE THINGS ABOVE AND THE SOULS WHICH CAME FROM HEAVEN ABOUT THE THINGS
BENEATH
AND THEY TOLD ONE ANOTHER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED BY THE WAY
THOSE FROM BELOW WEEPING AND SORROWING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE THINGS
WHICH THEY HAD ENDURED AND SEEN IN THEIR JOURNEY BENEATH THE EARTH
NOW THE JOURNEY LASTED A THOUSAND YEARS WHILE THOSE FROM ABOVE WERE
DESCRIBING HEAVENLY DELIGHTS AND VISIONS OF INCONCEIVABLE BEAUTY
THE
STORY GLAUCON WOULD TAKE TOO LONG TO TELL BUT THE SUM WAS THIS HE
SAID THAT FOR EVERY WRONG WHICH THEY HAD DONE TO ANY ONE THEY SUFFERED
TENFOLD OR ONCE IN A HUNDRED YEARS SUCH BEING RECKONED TO BE THE
LENGTH OF MAN'S LIFE AND THE PENALTY BEING THUS PAID TEN TIMES IN A
THOUSAND YEARS
IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE ANY WHO HAD BEEN THE CAUSE
OF MANY DEATHS OR HAD BETRAYED OR ENSLAVED CITIES OR ARMIES OR BEEN
GUILTY OF ANY OTHER EVIL BEHAVIOUR FOR EACH AND ALL OF THEIR OFFENCES
THEY RECEIVED PUNISHMENT TEN TIMES OVER AND THE REWARDS OF BENEFICENCE
AND JUSTICE AND HOLINESS WERE IN THE SAME PROPORTION
I NEED HARDLY
REPEAT WHAT HE SAID CONCERNING YOUNG CHILDREN DYING ALMOST AS SOON
AS THEY WERE BORN
OF PIETY AND IMPIETY TO GODS AND PARENTS AND OF
MURDERERS THERE WERE RETRIBUTIONS OTHER AND GREATER FAR WHICH HE
DESCRIBED
HE MENTIONED THAT HE WAS PRESENT WHEN ONE OF THE SPIRITS
ASKED ANOTHER 'WHERE IS ARDIAEUS THE GREAT NOW THIS ARDIAEUS LIVED
A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE TIME OF ER HE HAD BEEN THE TYRANT OF
SOME CITY OF PAMPHYLIA AND HAD MURDERED HIS AGED FATHER AND HIS ELDER
BROTHER AND WAS SAID TO HAVE COMMITTED MANY OTHER ABOMINABLE CRIMES
THE ANSWER OF THE OTHER SPIRIT WAS 'HE COMES NOT HITHER AND WILL NEVER
COME
AND THIS SAID HE 'WAS ONE OF THE DREADFUL SIGHTS WHICH WE
OURSELVES WITNESSED
WE WERE AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN AND HAVING
COMPLETED ALL OUR EXPERIENCES WERE ABOUT TO REASCEND WHEN OF A SUDDEN
ARDIAEUS APPEARED AND SEVERAL OTHERS MOST OF WHOM WERE TYRANTS AND
THERE WERE ALSO BESIDES THE TYRANTS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN
GREAT CRIMINALS THEY WERE JUST AS THEY FANCIED ABOUT TO RETURN INTO
THE UPPER WORLD BUT THE MOUTH INSTEAD OF ADMITTING THEM GAVE A ROAR
WHENEVER ANY OF THESE INCURABLE SINNERS OR SOME ONE WHO HAD NOT BEEN
SUFFICIENTLY PUNISHED TRIED TO ASCEND AND THEN WILD MEN OF FIERY
ASPECT WHO WERE STANDING BY AND HEARD THE SOUND SEIZED AND CARRIED
THEM OFF AND ARDIAEUS AND OTHERS THEY BOUND HEAD AND FOOT AND HAND AND
THREW THEM DOWN AND FLAYED THEM WITH SCOURGES AND DRAGGED THEM ALONG
THE ROAD AT THE SIDE CARDING THEM ON THORNS LIKE WOOL AND DECLARING
TO THE PASSERS BY WHAT WERE THEIR CRIMES AND THAT THEY WERE BEING TAKEN
AWAY TO BE CAST INTO HELL AND OF ALL THE MANY TERRORS WHICH THEY HAD
ENDURED HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NONE LIKE THE TERROR WHICH EACH OF THEM
FELT AT THAT MOMENT LEST THEY SHOULD HEAR THE VOICE AND WHEN THERE WAS
SILENCE ONE BY ONE THEY ASCENDED WITH EXCEEDING JOY
THESE SAID ER
WERE THE PENALTIES AND RETRIBUTIONS AND THERE WERE BLESSINGS AS GREAT
NOW WHEN THE SPIRITS WHICH WERE IN THE MEADOW HAD TARRIED SEVEN DAYS
ON THE EIGHTH THEY WERE OBLIGED TO PROCEED ON THEIR JOURNEY AND ON THE
FOURTH DAY AFTER HE SAID THAT THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD
SEE FROM ABOVE A LINE OF LIGHT STRAIGHT AS A COLUMN EXTENDING RIGHT
THROUGH THE WHOLE HEAVEN AND THROUGH THE EARTH IN COLOUR RESEMBLING THE
RAINBOW ONLY BRIGHTER AND PURER ANOTHER DAY'S JOURNEY BROUGHT THEM TO
THE PLACE AND THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE LIGHT THEY SAW THE ENDS OF
THE CHAINS OF HEAVEN LET DOWN FROM ABOVE FOR THIS LIGHT IS THE BELT
OF HEAVEN AND HOLDS TOGETHER THE CIRCLE OF THE UNIVERSE LIKE THE
UNDER GIRDERS OF A TRIREME
FROM THESE ENDS IS EXTENDED THE SPINDLE OF
NECESSITY ON WHICH ALL THE REVOLUTIONS TURN
THE SHAFT AND HOOK OF THIS
SPINDLE ARE MADE OF STEEL AND THE WHORL IS MADE PARTLY OF STEEL AND
ALSO PARTLY OF OTHER MATERIALS
NOW THE WHORL IS IN FORM LIKE THE WHORL
USED ON EARTH AND THE DESCRIPTION OF IT IMPLIED THAT THERE IS ONE LARGE
HOLLOW WHORL WHICH IS QUITE SCOOPED OUT AND INTO THIS IS FITTED ANOTHER
LESSER ONE AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND FOUR OTHERS MAKING EIGHT
IN ALL LIKE VESSELS WHICH FIT INTO ONE ANOTHER THE WHORLS SHOW THEIR
EDGES ON THE UPPER SIDE AND ON THEIR LOWER SIDE ALL TOGETHER FORM ONE
CONTINUOUS WHORL
THIS IS PIERCED BY THE SPINDLE WHICH IS DRIVEN HOME
THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE EIGHTH
THE FIRST AND OUTERMOST WHORL HAS THE
RIM BROADEST AND THE SEVEN INNER WHORLS ARE NARROWER IN THE FOLLOWING
PROPORTIONS THE SIXTH IS NEXT TO THE FIRST IN SIZE THE FOURTH NEXT
TO THE SIXTH THEN COMES THE EIGHTH THE SEVENTH IS FIFTH THE FIFTH
IS SIXTH THE THIRD IS SEVENTH LAST AND EIGHTH COMES THE SECOND
THE LARGEST OR FIXED STARS IS SPANGLED AND THE SEVENTH OR SUN IS
BRIGHTEST THE EIGHTH OR MOON COLOURED BY THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF THE
SEVENTH THE SECOND AND FIFTH SATURN AND MERCURY ARE IN COLOUR LIKE
ONE ANOTHER AND YELLOWER THAN THE PRECEDING THE THIRD VENUS HAS THE
WHITEST LIGHT THE FOURTH MARS IS REDDISH THE SIXTH JUPITER IS IN
WHITENESS SECOND
NOW THE WHOLE SPINDLE HAS THE SAME MOTION BUT AS THE
WHOLE REVOLVES IN ONE DIRECTION THE SEVEN INNER CIRCLES MOVE SLOWLY IN
THE OTHER AND OF THESE THE SWIFTEST IS THE EIGHTH NEXT IN SWIFTNESS
ARE THE SEVENTH SIXTH AND FIFTH WHICH MOVE TOGETHER THIRD IN
SWIFTNESS APPEARED TO MOVE ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THIS REVERSED MOTION
THE FOURTH THE THIRD APPEARED FOURTH AND THE SECOND FIFTH
THE SPINDLE
TURNS ON THE KNEES OF NECESSITY AND ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF EACH CIRCLE
IS A SIREN WHO GOES ROUND WITH THEM HYMNING A SINGLE TONE OR NOTE
THE
EIGHT TOGETHER FORM ONE HARMONY AND ROUND ABOUT AT EQUAL INTERVALS
THERE IS ANOTHER BAND THREE IN NUMBER EACH SITTING UPON HER THRONE
THESE ARE THE FATES DAUGHTERS OF NECESSITY WHO ARE CLOTHED IN WHITE
ROBES AND HAVE CHAPLETS UPON THEIR HEADS LACHESIS AND CLOTHO
AND ATROPOS WHO ACCOMPANY WITH THEIR VOICES THE HARMONY OF THE
SIRENS LACHESIS SINGING OF THE PAST CLOTHO OF THE PRESENT ATROPOS OF
THE FUTURE CLOTHO FROM TIME TO TIME ASSISTING WITH A TOUCH OF HER RIGHT
HAND THE REVOLUTION OF THE OUTER CIRCLE OF THE WHORL OR SPINDLE AND
ATROPOS WITH HER LEFT HAND TOUCHING AND GUIDING THE INNER ONES AND
LACHESIS LAYING HOLD OF EITHER IN TURN FIRST WITH ONE HAND AND THEN
WITH THE OTHER
WHEN ER AND THE SPIRITS ARRIVED THEIR DUTY WAS TO GO AT ONCE TO
LACHESIS BUT FIRST OF ALL THERE CAME A PROPHET WHO ARRANGED THEM IN
ORDER THEN HE TOOK FROM THE KNEES OF LACHESIS LOTS AND SAMPLES OF
LIVES AND HAVING MOUNTED A HIGH PULPIT SPOKE AS FOLLOWS 'HEAR THE
WORD OF LACHESIS THE DAUGHTER OF NECESSITY
MORTAL SOULS BEHOLD A NEW
CYCLE OF LIFE AND MORTALITY
YOUR GENIUS WILL NOT BE ALLOTTED TO YOU
BUT YOU WILL CHOOSE YOUR GENIUS AND LET HIM WHO DRAWS THE FIRST LOT
HAVE THE FIRST CHOICE AND THE LIFE WHICH HE CHOOSES SHALL BE HIS
DESTINY
VIRTUE IS FREE AND AS A MAN HONOURS OR DISHONOURS HER HE WILL
HAVE MORE OR LESS OF HER THE RESPONSIBILITY IS WITH THE CHOOSER GOD
IS JUSTIFIED WHEN THE INTERPRETER HAD THUS SPOKEN HE SCATTERED LOTS
INDIFFERENTLY AMONG THEM ALL AND EACH OF THEM TOOK UP THE LOT WHICH
FELL NEAR HIM ALL BUT ER HIMSELF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED AND EACH AS
HE TOOK HIS LOT PERCEIVED THE NUMBER WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED
THEN THE
INTERPRETER PLACED ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEM THE SAMPLES OF LIVES AND
THERE WERE MANY MORE LIVES THAN THE SOULS PRESENT AND THEY WERE OF ALL
SORTS
THERE WERE LIVES OF EVERY ANIMAL AND OF MAN IN EVERY CONDITION
AND THERE WERE TYRANNIES AMONG THEM SOME LASTING OUT THE TYRANT'S LIFE
OTHERS WHICH BROKE OFF IN THE MIDDLE AND CAME TO AN END IN POVERTY AND
EXILE AND BEGGARY AND THERE WERE LIVES OF FAMOUS MEN SOME WHO WERE
FAMOUS FOR THEIR FORM AND BEAUTY AS WELL AS FOR THEIR STRENGTH AND
SUCCESS IN GAMES OR AGAIN FOR THEIR BIRTH AND THE QUALITIES OF THEIR
ANCESTORS AND SOME WHO WERE THE REVERSE OF FAMOUS FOR THE OPPOSITE
QUALITIES
AND OF WOMEN LIKEWISE THERE WAS NOT HOWEVER ANY DEFINITE
CHARACTER IN THEM BECAUSE THE SOUL WHEN CHOOSING A NEW LIFE MUST OF
NECESSITY BECOME DIFFERENT
BUT THERE WAS EVERY OTHER QUALITY AND
THE ALL MINGLED WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ALSO WITH ELEMENTS OF WEALTH AND
POVERTY AND DISEASE AND HEALTH AND THERE WERE MEAN STATES ALSO
AND
HERE MY DEAR GLAUCON IS THE SUPREME PERIL OF OUR HUMAN STATE AND
THEREFORE THE UTMOST CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN
LET EACH ONE OF US LEAVE
EVERY OTHER KIND OF KNOWLEDGE AND SEEK AND FOLLOW ONE THING ONLY IF
PERADVENTURE HE MAY BE ABLE TO LEARN AND MAY FIND SOME ONE WHO WILL MAKE
HIM ABLE TO LEARN AND DISCERN BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL AND SO TO CHOOSE
ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE THE BETTER LIFE AS HE HAS OPPORTUNITY
HE SHOULD
CONSIDER THE BEARING OF ALL THESE THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED
SEVERALLY AND COLLECTIVELY UPON VIRTUE HE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE EFFECT
OF BEAUTY IS WHEN COMBINED WITH POVERTY OR WEALTH IN A PARTICULAR SOUL
AND WHAT ARE THE GOOD AND EVIL CONSEQUENCES OF NOBLE AND HUMBLE BIRTH
OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC STATION OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF CLEVERNESS
AND DULLNESS AND OF ALL THE NATURAL AND ACQUIRED GIFTS OF THE SOUL AND
THE OPERATION OF THEM WHEN CONJOINED HE WILL THEN LOOK AT THE NATURE OF
THE SOUL AND FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF ALL THESE QUALITIES HE WILL BE
ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH IS THE BETTER AND WHICH IS THE WORSE AND SO
HE WILL CHOOSE GIVING THE NAME OF EVIL TO THE LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE HIS
SOUL MORE UNJUST AND GOOD TO THE LIFE WHICH WILL MAKE HIS SOUL MORE
JUST ALL ELSE HE WILL DISREGARD
FOR WE HAVE SEEN AND KNOW THAT THIS IS
THE BEST CHOICE BOTH IN LIFE AND AFTER DEATH
A MAN MUST TAKE WITH HIM
INTO THE WORLD BELOW AN ADAMANTINE FAITH IN TRUTH AND RIGHT THAT THERE
TOO HE MAY BE UNDAZZLED BY THE DESIRE OF WEALTH OR THE OTHER ALLUREMENTS
OF EVIL LEST COMING UPON TYRANNIES AND SIMILAR VILLAINIES HE DO
IRREMEDIABLE WRONGS TO OTHERS AND SUFFER YET WORSE HIMSELF BUT LET HIM
KNOW HOW TO CHOOSE THE MEAN AND AVOID THE EXTREMES ON EITHER SIDE AS
FAR AS POSSIBLE NOT ONLY IN THIS LIFE BUT IN ALL THAT WHICH IS TO COME
FOR THIS IS THE WAY OF HAPPINESS
AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE MESSENGER FROM THE OTHER WORLD THIS
WAS WHAT THE PROPHET SAID AT THE TIME 'EVEN FOR THE LAST COMER IF HE
CHOOSES WISELY AND WILL LIVE DILIGENTLY THERE IS APPOINTED A HAPPY AND
NOT UNDESIRABLE EXISTENCE
LET NOT HIM WHO CHOOSES FIRST BE CARELESS
AND LET NOT THE LAST DESPAIR AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN HE WHO HAD THE
FIRST CHOICE CAME FORWARD AND IN A MOMENT CHOSE THE GREATEST TYRANNY
HIS MIND HAVING BEEN DARKENED BY FOLLY AND SENSUALITY HE HAD NOT
THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE MATTER BEFORE HE CHOSE AND DID NOT AT FIRST
SIGHT PERCEIVE THAT HE WAS FATED AMONG OTHER EVILS TO DEVOUR HIS OWN
CHILDREN
BUT WHEN HE HAD TIME TO REFLECT AND SAW WHAT WAS IN THE LOT
HE BEGAN TO BEAT HIS BREAST AND LAMENT OVER HIS CHOICE FORGETTING THE
PROCLAMATION OF THE PROPHET FOR INSTEAD OF THROWING THE BLAME OF HIS
MISFORTUNE ON HIMSELF HE ACCUSED CHANCE AND THE GODS AND EVERYTHING
RATHER THAN HIMSELF
NOW HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO CAME FROM HEAVEN AND
IN A FORMER LIFE HAD DWELT IN A WELL ORDERED STATE BUT HIS VIRTUE WAS
A MATTER OF HABIT ONLY AND HE HAD NO PHILOSOPHY
AND IT WAS TRUE OF
OTHERS WHO WERE SIMILARLY OVERTAKEN THAT THE GREATER NUMBER OF THEM
CAME FROM HEAVEN AND THEREFORE THEY HAD NEVER BEEN SCHOOLED BY TRIAL
WHEREAS THE PILGRIMS WHO CAME FROM EARTH HAVING THEMSELVES SUFFERED AND
SEEN OTHERS SUFFER WERE NOT IN A HURRY TO CHOOSE
AND OWING TO THIS
INEXPERIENCE OF THEIRS AND ALSO BECAUSE THE LOT WAS A CHANCE MANY OF
THE SOULS EXCHANGED A GOOD DESTINY FOR AN EVIL OR AN EVIL FOR A GOOD
FOR IF A MAN HAD ALWAYS ON HIS ARRIVAL IN THIS WORLD DEDICATED HIMSELF
FROM THE FIRST TO SOUND PHILOSOPHY AND HAD BEEN MODERATELY FORTUNATE
IN THE NUMBER OF THE LOT HE MIGHT AS THE MESSENGER REPORTED BE HAPPY
HERE AND ALSO HIS JOURNEY TO ANOTHER LIFE AND RETURN TO THIS INSTEAD
OF BEING ROUGH AND UNDERGROUND WOULD BE SMOOTH AND HEAVENLY
MOST
CURIOUS HE SAID WAS THE SPECTACLE SAD AND LAUGHABLE AND STRANGE FOR
THE CHOICE OF THE SOULS WAS IN MOST CASES BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF
A PREVIOUS LIFE
THERE HE SAW THE SOUL WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN ORPHEUS
CHOOSING THE LIFE OF A SWAN OUT OF ENMITY TO THE RACE OF WOMEN HATING
TO BE BORN OF A WOMAN BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN HIS MURDERERS HE BEHELD
ALSO THE SOUL OF THAMYRAS CHOOSING THE LIFE OF A NIGHTINGALE BIRDS ON
THE OTHER HAND LIKE THE SWAN AND OTHER MUSICIANS WANTING TO BE MEN
THE SOUL WHICH OBTAINED THE TWENTIETH LOT CHOSE THE LIFE OF A LION AND
THIS WAS THE SOUL OF AJAX THE SON OF TELAMON WHO WOULD NOT BE A MAN
REMEMBERING THE INJUSTICE WHICH WAS DONE HIM IN THE JUDGMENT ABOUT THE
ARMS
THE NEXT WAS AGAMEMNON WHO TOOK THE LIFE OF AN EAGLE BECAUSE
LIKE AJAX HE HATED HUMAN NATURE BY REASON OF HIS SUFFERINGS
ABOUT
THE MIDDLE CAME THE LOT OF ATALANTA SHE SEEING THE GREAT FAME OF
AN ATHLETE WAS UNABLE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION AND AFTER HER THERE
FOLLOWED THE SOUL OF EPEUS THE SON OF PANOPEUS PASSING INTO THE NATURE
OF A WOMAN CUNNING IN THE ARTS AND FAR AWAY AMONG THE LAST WHO CHOSE
THE SOUL OF THE JESTER THERSITES WAS PUTTING ON THE FORM OF A MONKEY
THERE CAME ALSO THE SOUL OF ODYSSEUS HAVING YET TO MAKE A CHOICE AND
HIS LOT HAPPENED TO BE THE LAST OF THEM ALL
NOW THE RECOLLECTION OF
FORMER TOILS HAD DISENCHANTED HIM OF AMBITION AND HE WENT ABOUT FOR
A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN SEARCH OF THE LIFE OF A PRIVATE MAN WHO HAD NO
CARES HE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THIS WHICH WAS LYING ABOUT AND
HAD BEEN NEGLECTED BY EVERYBODY ELSE AND WHEN HE SAW IT HE SAID THAT
HE WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME HAD HIS LOT BEEN FIRST INSTEAD OF LAST
AND THAT HE WAS DELIGHTED TO HAVE IT
AND NOT ONLY DID MEN PASS INTO
ANIMALS BUT I MUST ALSO MENTION THAT THERE WERE ANIMALS TAME AND WILD
WHO CHANGED INTO ONE ANOTHER AND INTO CORRESPONDING HUMAN NATURES THE
GOOD INTO THE GENTLE AND THE EVIL INTO THE SAVAGE IN ALL SORTS OF
COMBINATIONS
ALL THE SOULS HAD NOW CHOSEN THEIR LIVES AND THEY WENT IN THE ORDER OF
THEIR CHOICE TO LACHESIS WHO SENT WITH THEM THE GENIUS WHOM THEY HAD
SEVERALLY CHOSEN TO BE THE GUARDIAN OF THEIR LIVES AND THE FULFILLER
OF THE CHOICE THIS GENIUS LED THE SOULS FIRST TO CLOTHO AND DREW
THEM WITHIN THE REVOLUTION OF THE SPINDLE IMPELLED BY HER HAND THUS
RATIFYING THE DESTINY OF EACH AND THEN WHEN THEY WERE FASTENED TO
THIS CARRIED THEM TO ATROPOS WHO SPUN THE THREADS AND MADE THEM
IRREVERSIBLE WHENCE WITHOUT TURNING ROUND THEY PASSED BENEATH THE
THRONE OF NECESSITY AND WHEN THEY HAD ALL PASSED THEY MARCHED ON IN A
SCORCHING HEAT TO THE PLAIN OF FORGETFULNESS WHICH WAS A BARREN WASTE
DESTITUTE OF TREES AND VERDURE AND THEN TOWARDS EVENING THEY ENCAMPED
BY THE RIVER OF UNMINDFULNESS WHOSE WATER NO VESSEL CAN HOLD OF THIS
THEY WERE ALL OBLIGED TO DRINK A CERTAIN QUANTITY AND THOSE WHO WERE
NOT SAVED BY WISDOM DRANK MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY AND EACH ONE AS HE
DRANK FORGOT ALL THINGS
NOW AFTER THEY HAD GONE TO REST ABOUT THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THERE WAS A THUNDERSTORM AND EARTHQUAKE AND THEN
IN AN INSTANT THEY WERE DRIVEN UPWARDS IN ALL MANNER OF WAYS TO THEIR
BIRTH LIKE STARS SHOOTING
HE HIMSELF WAS HINDERED FROM DRINKING THE
WATER
BUT IN WHAT MANNER OR BY WHAT MEANS HE RETURNED TO THE BODY HE
COULD NOT SAY ONLY IN THE MORNING AWAKING SUDDENLY HE FOUND HIMSELF
LYING ON THE PYRE
AND THUS GLAUCON THE TALE HAS BEEN SAVED AND HAS NOT PERISHED AND
WILL SAVE US IF WE ARE OBEDIENT TO THE WORD SPOKEN AND WE SHALL PASS
SAFELY OVER THE RIVER OF FORGETFULNESS AND OUR SOUL WILL NOT BE DEFILED
WHEREFORE MY COUNSEL IS THAT WE HOLD FAST EVER TO THE HEAVENLY WAY AND
FOLLOW AFTER JUSTICE AND VIRTUE ALWAYS CONSIDERING THAT THE SOUL IS
IMMORTAL AND ABLE TO ENDURE EVERY SORT OF GOOD AND EVERY SORT OF EVIL
THUS SHALL WE LIVE DEAR TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE GODS BOTH WHILE
REMAINING HERE AND WHEN LIKE CONQUERORS IN THE GAMES WHO GO ROUND TO
GATHER GIFTS WE RECEIVE OUR REWARD
AND IT SHALL BE WELL WITH US BOTH
IN THIS LIFE AND IN THE PILGRIMAGE OF A THOUSAND YEARS WHICH WE HAVE
BEEN DESCRIBING

SYMPOSIUM
BY PLATO
TRANSLATED BY BENJAMIN JOWETT
INTRODUCTION
OF ALL THE WORKS OF PLATO THE SYMPOSIUM IS THE MOST PERFECT IN FORM
AND MAY BE TRULY THOUGHT TO CONTAIN MORE THAN ANY COMMENTATOR HAS EVER
DREAMED OF OR AS GOETHE SAID OF ONE OF HIS OWN WRITINGS MORE THAN THE
AUTHOR HIMSELF KNEW
FOR IN PHILOSOPHY AS IN PROPHECY GLIMPSES OF THE
FUTURE MAY OFTEN BE CONVEYED IN WORDS WHICH COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN
UNDERSTOOD OR INTERPRETED AT THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE UTTERED COMPARE
SYMP WHICH WERE WISER THAN THE WRITER OF THEM MEANT AND COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY HIM IF HE HAD BEEN INTERROGATED ABOUT THEM
YET PLATO WAS NOT A MYSTIC NOR IN ANY DEGREE AFFECTED BY THE EASTERN
INFLUENCES WHICH AFTERWARDS OVERSPREAD THE ALEXANDRIAN WORLD
HE WAS
NOT AN ENTHUSIAST OR A SENTIMENTALIST BUT ONE WHO ASPIRED ONLY TO
SEE REASONED TRUTH AND WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE CLEARLY EXPLAINED IN HIS
LANGUAGE
THERE IS NO FOREIGN ELEMENT EITHER OF EGYPT OR OF ASIA TO
BE FOUND IN HIS WRITINGS
AND MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLATONIC WORK THE
SYMPOSIUM IS GREEK BOTH IN STYLE AND SUBJECT HAVING A BEAUTY 'AS OF
A STATUE WHILE THE COMPANION DIALOGUE OF THE PHAEDRUS IS MARKED BY
A SORT OF GOTHIC IRREGULARITY
MORE TOO THAN IN ANY OTHER OF HIS
DIALOGUES PLATO IS EMANCIPATED FROM FORMER PHILOSOPHIES
THE GENIUS OF
GREEK ART SEEMS TO TRIUMPH OVER THE TRADITIONS OF PYTHAGOREAN ELEATIC
OR MEGARIAN SYSTEMS AND 'THE OLD QUARREL OF POETRY AND PHILOSOPHY' HAS
AT LEAST A SUPERFICIAL RECONCILEMENT
REP
AN UNKNOWN PERSON WHO HAD HEARD OF THE DISCOURSES IN PRAISE OF LOVE
SPOKEN BY SOCRATES AND OTHERS AT THE BANQUET OF AGATHON IS DESIROUS OF
HAVING AN AUTHENTIC ACCOUNT OF THEM WHICH HE THINKS THAT HE CAN
OBTAIN FROM APOLLODORUS THE SAME EXCITABLE OR RATHER 'MAD' FRIEND OF
SOCRATES WHO IS AFTERWARDS INTRODUCED IN THE PHAEDO
HE HAD IMAGINED
THAT THE DISCOURSES WERE RECENT
THERE HE IS MISTAKEN BUT THEY ARE
STILL FRESH IN THE MEMORY OF HIS INFORMANT WHO HAD JUST BEEN REPEATING
THEM TO GLAUCON AND IS QUITE PREPARED TO HAVE ANOTHER REHEARSAL OF THEM
IN A WALK FROM THE PIRAEUS TO ATHENS
ALTHOUGH HE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT
HIMSELF HE HAD HEARD THEM FROM THE BEST AUTHORITY
ARISTODEMUS WHO
IS DESCRIBED AS HAVING BEEN IN PAST TIMES A HUMBLE BUT INSEPARABLE
ATTENDANT OF SOCRATES HAD REPORTED THEM TO HIM COMPARE XEN
MEM
THE NARRATIVE WHICH HE HAD HEARD WAS AS FOLLOWS
ARISTODEMUS MEETING SOCRATES IN HOLIDAY ATTIRE IS INVITED BY HIM TO
A BANQUET AT THE HOUSE OF AGATHON WHO HAD BEEN SACRIFICING IN
THANKSGIVING FOR HIS TRAGIC VICTORY ON THE DAY PREVIOUS
BUT NO SOONER
HAS HE ENTERED THE HOUSE THAN HE FINDS THAT HE IS ALONE SOCRATES HAS
STAYED BEHIND IN A FIT OF ABSTRACTION AND DOES NOT APPEAR UNTIL THE
BANQUET IS HALF OVER
ON HIS APPEARING HE AND THE HOST JEST A LITTLE
THE QUESTION IS THEN ASKED BY PAUSANIAS ONE OF THE GUESTS 'WHAT SHALL
THEY DO ABOUT DRINKING AS THEY HAD BEEN ALL WELL DRUNK ON THE DAY
BEFORE AND DRINKING ON TWO SUCCESSIVE DAYS IS SUCH A BAD THING THIS
IS CONFIRMED BY THE AUTHORITY OF ERYXIMACHUS THE PHYSICIAN WHO FURTHER
PROPOSES THAT INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO THE FLUTE GIRL AND HER 'NOISE'
THEY SHALL MAKE SPEECHES IN HONOUR OF LOVE ONE AFTER ANOTHER GOING
FROM LEFT TO RIGHT IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY ARE RECLINING AT THE
TABLE
ALL OF THEM AGREE TO THIS PROPOSAL AND PHAEDRUS WHO IS
THE 'FATHER' OF THE IDEA WHICH HE HAS PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED TO
ERYXIMACHUS BEGINS AS FOLLOWS
HE DESCANTS FIRST OF ALL UPON THE ANTIQUITY OF LOVE WHICH IS PROVED BY
THE AUTHORITY OF THE POETS SECONDLY UPON THE BENEFITS WHICH LOVE GIVES
TO MAN
THE GREATEST OF THESE IS THE SENSE OF HONOUR AND DISHONOUR
THE LOVER IS ASHAMED TO BE SEEN BY THE BELOVED DOING OR SUFFERING ANY
COWARDLY OR MEAN ACT
AND A STATE OR ARMY WHICH WAS MADE UP ONLY OF
LOVERS AND THEIR LOVES WOULD BE INVINCIBLE
FOR LOVE WILL CONVERT THE
VERIEST COWARD INTO AN INSPIRED HERO
AND THERE HAVE BEEN TRUE LOVES NOT ONLY OF MEN BUT OF WOMEN ALSO
SUCH
WAS THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WHO DARED TO DIE FOR HER HUSBAND AND IN
RECOMPENSE OF HER VIRTUE WAS ALLOWED TO COME AGAIN FROM THE DEAD
BUT
ORPHEUS THE MISERABLE HARPER WHO WENT DOWN TO HADES ALIVE THAT HE
MIGHT BRING BACK HIS WIFE WAS MOCKED WITH AN APPARITION ONLY AND
THE GODS AFTERWARDS CONTRIVED HIS DEATH AS THE PUNISHMENT OF HIS
COWARDLINESS
THE LOVE OF ACHILLES LIKE THAT OF ALCESTIS WAS
COURAGEOUS AND TRUE FOR HE WAS WILLING TO AVENGE HIS LOVER PATROCLUS
ALTHOUGH HE KNEW THAT HIS OWN DEATH WOULD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW AND
THE GODS WHO HONOUR THE LOVE OF THE BELOVED ABOVE THAT OF THE LOVER
REWARDED HIM AND SENT HIM TO THE ISLANDS OF THE BLEST
PAUSANIAS WHO WAS SITTING NEXT THEN TAKES UP THE TALE HE SAYS THAT
PHAEDRUS SHOULD HAVE DISTINGUISHED THE HEAVENLY LOVE FROM THE EARTHLY
BEFORE HE PRAISED EITHER
FOR THERE ARE TWO LOVES AS THERE ARE TWO
APHRODITES ONE THE DAUGHTER OF URANUS WHO HAS NO MOTHER AND IS THE
ELDER AND WISER GODDESS AND THE OTHER THE DAUGHTER OF ZEUS AND DIONE
WHO IS POPULAR AND COMMON
THE FIRST OF THE TWO LOVES HAS A NOBLE
PURPOSE AND DELIGHTS ONLY IN THE INTELLIGENT NATURE OF MAN AND IS
FAITHFUL TO THE END AND HAS NO SHADOW OF WANTONNESS OR LUST
THE SECOND
IS THE COARSER KIND OF LOVE WHICH IS A LOVE OF THE BODY RATHER THAN OF
THE SOUL AND IS OF WOMEN AND BOYS AS WELL AS OF MEN
NOW THE ACTIONS OF
LOVERS VARY LIKE EVERY OTHER SORT OF ACTION ACCORDING TO THE MANNER OF
THEIR PERFORMANCE
AND IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION ABOUT MALE LOVES
SOME LIKE THE BOEOTIANS APPROVE OF THEM
OTHERS LIKE THE IONIANS AND MOST OF THE BARBARIANS DISAPPROVE OF
THEM PARTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE AWARE OF THE POLITICAL DANGERS WHICH ENSUE
FROM THEM AS MAY BE SEEN IN THE INSTANCE OF HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGEITON
AT ATHENS AND SPARTA THERE IS AN APPARENT CONTRADICTION ABOUT THEM
FOR
AT TIMES THEY ARE ENCOURAGED AND THEN THE LOVER IS ALLOWED TO PLAY ALL
SORTS OF FANTASTIC TRICKS HE MAY SWEAR AND FORSWEAR HIMSELF AND 'AT
LOVERS' PERJURIES THEY SAY JOVE LAUGHS' HE MAY BE A SERVANT AND LIE
ON A MAT AT THE DOOR OF HIS LOVE WITHOUT ANY LOSS OF CHARACTER BUT
THERE ARE ALSO TIMES WHEN ELDERS LOOK GRAVE AND GUARD THEIR YOUNG
RELATIONS AND PERSONAL REMARKS ARE MADE
THE TRUTH IS THAT SOME OF
THESE LOVES ARE DISGRACEFUL AND OTHERS HONOURABLE
THE VULGAR LOVE OF
THE BODY WHICH TAKES WING AND FLIES AWAY WHEN THE BLOOM OF YOUTH IS
OVER IS DISGRACEFUL AND SO IS THE INTERESTED LOVE OF POWER OR WEALTH
BUT THE LOVE OF THE NOBLE MIND IS LASTING
THE LOVER SHOULD BE TESTED
AND THE BELOVED SHOULD NOT BE TOO READY TO YIELD
THE RULE IN OUR
COUNTRY IS THAT THE BELOVED MAY DO THE SAME SERVICE TO THE LOVER IN THE
WAY OF VIRTUE WHICH THE LOVER MAY DO TO HIM
A VOLUNTARY SERVICE TO BE RENDERED FOR THE SAKE OF VIRTUE AND WISDOM IS
PERMITTED AMONG US AND WHEN THESE TWO CUSTOMS ONE THE LOVE OF YOUTH
THE OTHER THE PRACTICE OF VIRTUE AND PHILOSOPHY MEET IN ONE THEN THE
LOVERS MAY LAWFULLY UNITE
NOR IS THERE ANY DISGRACE TO A DISINTERESTED
LOVER IN BEING DECEIVED BUT THE INTERESTED LOVER IS DOUBLY DISGRACED
FOR IF HE LOSES HIS LOVE HE LOSES HIS CHARACTER WHEREAS THE NOBLE
LOVE OF THE OTHER REMAINS THE SAME ALTHOUGH THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE IS
UNWORTHY FOR NOTHING CAN BE NOBLER THAN LOVE FOR THE SAKE OF VIRTUE
THIS IS THAT LOVE OF THE HEAVENLY GODDESS WHICH IS OF GREAT PRICE TO
INDIVIDUALS AND CITIES MAKING THEM WORK TOGETHER FOR THEIR IMPROVEMENT
THE TURN OF ARISTOPHANES COMES NEXT BUT HE HAS THE HICCOUGH AND
THEREFORE PROPOSES THAT ERYXIMACHUS THE PHYSICIAN SHALL CURE HIM
OR SPEAK IN HIS TURN
ERYXIMACHUS IS READY TO DO BOTH AND AFTER
PRESCRIBING FOR THE HICCOUGH SPEAKS AS FOLLOWS
HE AGREES WITH PAUSANIAS IN MAINTAINING THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF
LOVE BUT HIS ART HAS LED HIM TO THE FURTHER CONCLUSION THAT THE EMPIRE
OF THIS DOUBLE LOVE EXTENDS OVER ALL THINGS AND IS TO BE FOUND IN
ANIMALS AND PLANTS AS WELL AS IN MAN
IN THE HUMAN BODY ALSO THERE ARE
TWO LOVES AND THE ART OF MEDICINE SHOWS WHICH IS THE GOOD AND WHICH IS
THE BAD LOVE AND PERSUADES THE BODY TO ACCEPT THE GOOD AND REJECT THE
BAD AND RECONCILES CONFLICTING ELEMENTS AND MAKES THEM FRIENDS
EVERY
ART GYMNASTIC AND HUSBANDRY AS WELL AS MEDICINE IS THE RECONCILIATION
OF OPPOSITES AND THIS IS WHAT HERACLEITUS MEANT WHEN HE SPOKE OF A
HARMONY OF OPPOSITES BUT IN STRICTNESS HE SHOULD RATHER HAVE SPOKEN OF
A HARMONY WHICH SUCCEEDS OPPOSITES FOR AN AGREEMENT OF DISAGREEMENTS
THERE CANNOT BE
MUSIC TOO IS CONCERNED WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF LOVE IN
THEIR APPLICATION TO HARMONY AND RHYTHM
IN THE ABSTRACT ALL IS SIMPLE
AND WE ARE NOT TROUBLED WITH THE TWOFOLD LOVE BUT WHEN THEY ARE APPLIED
IN EDUCATION WITH THEIR ACCOMPANIMENTS OF SONG AND METRE THEN THE
DISCORD BEGINS
THEN THE OLD TALE HAS TO BE REPEATED OF FAIR URANIA AND
THE COARSE POLYHYMNIA WHO MUST BE INDULGED SPARINGLY JUST AS IN MY
OWN ART OF MEDICINE CARE MUST BE TAKEN THAT THE TASTE OF THE EPICURE BE
GRATIFIED WITHOUT INFLICTING UPON HIM THE ATTENDANT PENALTY OF DISEASE
THERE IS A SIMILAR HARMONY OR DISAGREEMENT IN THE COURSE OF THE SEASONS
AND IN THE RELATIONS OF MOIST AND DRY HOT AND COLD HOAR FROST AND
BLIGHT AND DISEASES OF ALL SORTS SPRING FROM THE EXCESSES OR DISORDERS
OF THE ELEMENT OF LOVE
THE KNOWLEDGE OF THESE ELEMENTS OF LOVE AND
DISCORD IN THE HEAVENLY BODIES IS TERMED ASTRONOMY IN THE RELATIONS OF
MEN TOWARDS GODS AND PARENTS IS CALLED DIVINATION
FOR DIVINATION IS THE
PEACEMAKER OF GODS AND MEN AND WORKS BY A KNOWLEDGE OF THE TENDENCIES
OF MERELY HUMAN LOVES TO PIETY AND IMPIETY
SUCH IS THE POWER OF LOVE
AND THAT LOVE WHICH IS JUST AND TEMPERATE HAS THE GREATEST POWER AND
IS THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR HAPPINESS AND FRIENDSHIP WITH THE GODS AND WITH
ONE ANOTHER
I DARE SAY THAT I HAVE OMITTED TO MENTION MANY THINGS WHICH
YOU ARISTOPHANES MAY SUPPLY AS I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE CURED OF THE
HICCOUGH
ARISTOPHANES IS THE NEXT SPEAKER
HE PROFESSES TO OPEN A NEW VEIN OF DISCOURSE IN WHICH HE BEGINS BY
TREATING OF THE ORIGIN OF HUMAN NATURE
THE SEXES WERE ORIGINALLY THREE
MEN WOMEN AND THE UNION OF THE TWO AND THEY WERE MADE ROUND HAVING
FOUR HANDS FOUR FEET TWO FACES ON A ROUND NECK AND THE REST TO
CORRESPOND
TERRIBLE WAS THEIR STRENGTH AND SWIFTNESS AND THEY WERE
ESSAYING TO SCALE HEAVEN AND ATTACK THE GODS
DOUBT REIGNED IN THE
CELESTIAL COUNCILS THE GODS WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF QUELLING
THE PRIDE OF MAN AND THE FEAR OF LOSING THE SACRIFICES
AT LAST ZEUS HIT
UPON AN EXPEDIENT
LET US CUT THEM IN TWO HE SAID THEN THEY WILL ONLY
HAVE HALF THEIR STRENGTH AND WE SHALL HAVE TWICE AS MANY SACRIFICES
HE
SPAKE AND SPLIT THEM AS YOU MIGHT SPLIT AN EGG WITH AN HAIR AND WHEN
THIS WAS DONE HE TOLD APOLLO TO GIVE THEIR FACES A TWIST AND RE ARRANGE
THEIR PERSONS TAKING OUT THE WRINKLES AND TYING THE SKIN IN A KNOT
ABOUT THE NAVEL
THE TWO HALVES WENT ABOUT LOOKING FOR ONE ANOTHER AND
WERE READY TO DIE OF HUNGER IN ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS
THEN ZEUS INVENTED AN
ADJUSTMENT OF THE SEXES WHICH ENABLED THEM TO MARRY AND GO THEIR WAY
TO THE BUSINESS OF LIFE
NOW THE CHARACTERS OF MEN DIFFER ACCORDINGLY
AS THEY ARE DERIVED FROM THE ORIGINAL MAN OR THE ORIGINAL WOMAN OR THE
ORIGINAL MAN WOMAN
THOSE WHO COME FROM THE MAN WOMAN ARE LASCIVIOUS AND
ADULTEROUS THOSE WHO COME FROM THE WOMAN FORM FEMALE ATTACHMENTS THOSE
WHO ARE A SECTION OF THE MALE FOLLOW THE MALE AND EMBRACE HIM AND IN
HIM ALL THEIR DESIRES CENTRE
THE PAIR ARE INSEPARABLE AND LIVE TOGETHER
IN PURE AND MANLY AFFECTION YET THEY CANNOT TELL WHAT THEY WANT OF ONE
ANOTHER
BUT IF HEPHAESTUS WERE TO COME TO THEM WITH HIS INSTRUMENTS
AND PROPOSE THAT THEY SHOULD BE MELTED INTO ONE AND REMAIN ONE HERE AND
HEREAFTER THEY WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS THE VERY EXPRESSION OF
THEIR WANT
FOR LOVE IS THE DESIRE OF THE WHOLE AND THE PURSUIT OF THE
WHOLE IS CALLED LOVE
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE TWO SEXES WERE ONLY ONE
BUT NOW GOD HAS HALVED THEM MUCH AS THE LACEDAEMONIANS HAVE CUT UP
THE ARCADIANS AND IF THEY DO NOT BEHAVE THEMSELVES HE WILL DIVIDE
THEM AGAIN AND THEY WILL HOP ABOUT WITH HALF A NOSE AND FACE IN BASSO
RELIEVO
WHEREFORE LET US EXHORT ALL MEN TO PIETY THAT WE MAY OBTAIN
THE GOODS OF WHICH LOVE IS THE AUTHOR AND BE RECONCILED TO GOD AND
FIND OUR OWN TRUE LOVES WHICH RARELY HAPPENS IN THIS WORLD
AND NOW I
MUST BEG YOU NOT TO SUPPOSE THAT I AM ALLUDING TO PAUSANIAS AND AGATHON
COMPARE PROTAG FOR MY WORDS REFER TO ALL MANKIND EVERYWHERE
SOME RAILLERY ENSUES FIRST BETWEEN ARISTOPHANES AND ERYXIMACHUS AND
THEN BETWEEN AGATHON WHO FEARS A FEW SELECT FRIENDS MORE THAN ANY
NUMBER OF SPECTATORS AT THE THEATRE AND SOCRATES WHO IS DISPOSED TO
BEGIN AN ARGUMENT
THIS IS SPEEDILY REPRESSED BY PHAEDRUS WHO REMINDS
THE DISPUTANTS OF THEIR TRIBUTE TO THE GOD
AGATHON'S SPEECH FOLLOWS
HE WILL SPEAK OF THE GOD FIRST AND THEN OF HIS GIFTS HE IS THE FAIREST
AND BLESSEDEST AND BEST OF THE GODS AND ALSO THE YOUNGEST HAVING HAD
NO EXISTENCE IN THE OLD DAYS OF IAPETUS AND CRONOS WHEN THE GODS WERE
AT WAR
THE THINGS THAT WERE DONE THEN WERE DONE OF NECESSITY AND NOT
OF LOVE
FOR LOVE IS YOUNG AND DWELLS IN SOFT PLACES NOT LIKE ATE
IN HOMER WALKING ON THE SKULLS OF MEN BUT IN THEIR HEARTS AND
SOULS WHICH ARE SOFT ENOUGH
HE IS ALL FLEXIBILITY AND GRACE AND HIS
HABITATION IS AMONG THE FLOWERS AND HE CANNOT DO OR SUFFER WRONG FOR
ALL MEN SERVE AND OBEY HIM OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL AND WHERE THERE IS
LOVE THERE IS OBEDIENCE AND WHERE OBEDIENCE THERE IS JUSTICE FOR
NONE CAN BE WRONGED OF HIS OWN FREE WILL
AND HE IS TEMPERATE AS WELL AS
JUST FOR HE IS THE RULER OF THE DESIRES AND IF HE RULES THEM HE MUST
BE TEMPERATE
ALSO HE IS COURAGEOUS FOR HE IS THE CONQUEROR OF THE LORD
OF WAR
AND HE IS WISE TOO FOR HE IS A POET AND THE AUTHOR OF POESY IN
OTHERS
HE CREATED THE ANIMALS HE IS THE INVENTOR OF THE ARTS ALL THE
GODS ARE HIS SUBJECTS HE IS THE FAIREST AND BEST HIMSELF AND THE CAUSE
OF WHAT IS FAIREST AND BEST IN OTHERS HE MAKES MEN TO BE OF ONE MIND
AT A BANQUET FILLING THEM WITH AFFECTION AND EMPTYING THEM OF
DISAFFECTION THE PILOT HELPER DEFENDER SAVIOUR OF MEN IN WHOSE
FOOTSTEPS LET EVERY MAN FOLLOW CHANTING A STRAIN OF LOVE
SUCH IS THE
DISCOURSE HALF PLAYFUL HALF SERIOUS WHICH I DEDICATE TO THE GOD
THE TURN OF SOCRATES COMES NEXT
HE BEGINS BY REMARKING SATIRICALLY
THAT HE HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT FOR HE
FANCIED THAT THEY MEANT TO SPEAK THE TRUE PRAISES OF LOVE BUT NOW HE
FINDS THAT THEY ONLY SAY WHAT IS GOOD OF HIM WHETHER TRUE OR FALSE
HE
BEGS TO BE ABSOLVED FROM SPEAKING FALSELY BUT HE IS WILLING TO SPEAK
THE TRUTH AND PROPOSES TO BEGIN BY QUESTIONING AGATHON
THE RESULT OF
HIS QUESTIONS MAY BE SUMMED UP AS FOLLOWS
LOVE IS OF SOMETHING AND THAT WHICH LOVE DESIRES IS NOT THAT WHICH LOVE
IS OR HAS FOR NO MAN DESIRES THAT WHICH HE IS OR HAS
AND LOVE IS OF
THE BEAUTIFUL AND THEREFORE HAS NOT THE BEAUTIFUL
AND THE BEAUTIFUL
IS THE GOOD AND THEREFORE IN WANTING AND DESIRING THE BEAUTIFUL LOVE
ALSO WANTS AND DESIRES THE GOOD
SOCRATES PROFESSES TO HAVE ASKED THE
SAME QUESTIONS AND TO HAVE OBTAINED THE SAME ANSWERS FROM DIOTIMA A
WISE WOMAN OF MANTINEA WHO LIKE AGATHON HAD SPOKEN FIRST OF LOVE AND
THEN OF HIS WORKS
SOCRATES LIKE AGATHON HAD TOLD HER THAT LOVE IS A
MIGHTY GOD AND ALSO FAIR AND SHE HAD SHOWN HIM IN RETURN THAT LOVE WAS
NEITHER BUT IN A MEAN BETWEEN FAIR AND FOUL GOOD AND EVIL AND NOT A
GOD AT ALL BUT ONLY A GREAT DEMON OR INTERMEDIATE POWER COMPARE THE
SPEECH OF ERYXIMACHUS WHO CONVEYS TO THE GODS THE PRAYERS OF MEN AND
TO MEN THE COMMANDS OF THE GODS
SOCRATES ASKS WHO ARE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER TO THIS DIOTIMA REPLIES
THAT HE IS THE SON OF PLENTY AND POVERTY AND PARTAKES OF THE NATURE OF
BOTH AND IS FULL AND STARVED BY TURNS
LIKE HIS MOTHER HE IS POOR AND
SQUALID LYING ON MATS AT DOORS COMPARE THE SPEECH OF PAUSANIAS
LIKE HIS FATHER HE IS BOLD AND STRONG AND FULL OF ARTS AND RESOURCES
FURTHER HE IS IN A MEAN BETWEEN IGNORANCE AND KNOWLEDGE IN THIS HE
RESEMBLES THE PHILOSOPHER WHO IS ALSO IN A MEAN BETWEEN THE WISE AND THE
IGNORANT
SUCH IS THE NATURE OF LOVE WHO IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE
BELOVED
BUT LOVE DESIRES THE BEAUTIFUL AND THEN ARISES THE QUESTION WHAT DOES
HE DESIRE OF THE BEAUTIFUL HE DESIRES OF COURSE THE POSSESSION OF
THE BEAUTIFUL BUT WHAT IS GIVEN BY THAT FOR THE BEAUTIFUL LET US
SUBSTITUTE THE GOOD AND WE HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SEEING THE POSSESSION
OF THE GOOD TO BE HAPPINESS AND LOVE TO BE THE DESIRE OF HAPPINESS
ALTHOUGH THE MEANING OF THE WORD HAS BEEN TOO OFTEN CONFINED TO ONE
KIND OF LOVE
AND LOVE DESIRES NOT ONLY THE GOOD BUT THE EVERLASTING
POSSESSION OF THE GOOD
WHY THEN IS THERE ALL THIS FLUTTER AND
EXCITEMENT ABOUT LOVE BECAUSE ALL MEN AND WOMEN AT A CERTAIN AGE ARE
DESIROUS OF BRINGING TO THE BIRTH
AND LOVE IS NOT OF BEAUTY ONLY BUT
OF BIRTH IN BEAUTY THIS IS THE PRINCIPLE OF IMMORTALITY IN A MORTAL
CREATURE
WHEN BEAUTY APPROACHES THEN THE CONCEIVING POWER IS BENIGN
AND DIFFUSE WHEN FOULNESS SHE IS AVERTED AND MOROSE
BUT WHY AGAIN DOES THIS EXTEND NOT ONLY TO MEN BUT ALSO TO ANIMALS
BECAUSE THEY TOO HAVE AN INSTINCT OF IMMORTALITY
EVEN IN THE SAME
INDIVIDUAL THERE IS A PERPETUAL SUCCESSION AS WELL OF THE PARTS OF THE
MATERIAL BODY AS OF THE THOUGHTS AND DESIRES OF THE MIND NAY EVEN
KNOWLEDGE COMES AND GOES
THERE IS NO SAMENESS OF EXISTENCE BUT THE NEW
MORTALITY IS ALWAYS TAKING THE PLACE OF THE OLD
THIS IS THE REASON WHY
PARENTS LOVE THEIR CHILDREN FOR THE SAKE OF IMMORTALITY AND THIS IS
WHY MEN LOVE THE IMMORTALITY OF FAME
FOR THE CREATIVE SOUL CREATES NOT
CHILDREN BUT CONCEPTIONS OF WISDOM AND VIRTUE SUCH AS POETS AND OTHER
CREATORS HAVE INVENTED
AND THE NOBLEST CREATIONS OF ALL ARE THOSE OF
LEGISLATORS IN HONOUR OF WHOM TEMPLES HAVE BEEN RAISED
WHO WOULD NOT
SOONER HAVE THESE CHILDREN OF THE MIND THAN THE ORDINARY HUMAN ONES
COMPARE BACON'S ESSAYS 8 'CERTAINLY THE BEST WORKS AND OF GREATEST
MERIT FOR THE PUBLIC HAVE PROCEEDED FROM THE UNMARRIED OR CHILDLESS MEN
WHICH BOTH IN AFFECTION AND MEANS HAVE MARRIED AND ENDOWED THE PUBLIC
I WILL NOW INITIATE YOU SHE SAID INTO THE GREATER MYSTERIES FOR HE
WHO WOULD PROCEED IN DUE COURSE SHOULD LOVE FIRST ONE FAIR FORM AND
THEN MANY AND LEARN THE CONNEXION OF THEM AND FROM BEAUTIFUL BODIES
HE SHOULD PROCEED TO BEAUTIFUL MINDS AND THE BEAUTY OF LAWS AND
INSTITUTIONS UNTIL HE PERCEIVES THAT ALL BEAUTY IS OF ONE KINDRED AND
FROM INSTITUTIONS HE SHOULD GO ON TO THE SCIENCES UNTIL AT LAST THE
VISION IS REVEALED TO HIM OF A SINGLE SCIENCE OF UNIVERSAL BEAUTY AND
THEN HE WILL BEHOLD THE EVERLASTING NATURE WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF ALL
AND WILL BE NEAR THE END
IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT SUPREME BEING OF
LOVE HE WILL BE PURIFIED OF EARTHLY LEAVEN AND WILL BEHOLD BEAUTY NOT
WITH THE BODILY EYE BUT WITH THE EYE OF THE MIND AND WILL BRING FORTH
TRUE CREATIONS OF VIRTUE AND WISDOM AND BE THE FRIEND OF GOD AND HEIR
OF IMMORTALITY
SUCH PHAEDRUS IS THE TALE WHICH I HEARD FROM THE STRANGER OF MANTINEA
AND WHICH YOU MAY CALL THE ENCOMIUM OF LOVE OR WHAT YOU PLEASE
THE COMPANY APPLAUD THE SPEECH OF SOCRATES AND ARISTOPHANES IS ABOUT TO
SAY SOMETHING WHEN SUDDENLY A BAND OF REVELLERS BREAKS INTO THE COURT
AND THE VOICE OF ALCIBIADES IS HEARD ASKING FOR AGATHON
HE IS LED
IN DRUNK AND WELCOMED BY AGATHON WHOM HE HAS COME TO CROWN WITH
A GARLAND
HE IS PLACED ON A COUCH AT HIS SIDE BUT SUDDENLY ON
RECOGNIZING SOCRATES HE STARTS UP AND A SORT OF CONFLICT IS CARRIED
ON BETWEEN THEM WHICH AGATHON IS REQUESTED TO APPEASE
ALCIBIADES THEN
INSISTS THAT THEY SHALL DRINK AND HAS A LARGE WINE COOLER FILLED
WHICH HE FIRST EMPTIES HIMSELF AND THEN FILLS AGAIN AND PASSES ON TO
SOCRATES
HE IS INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AND IS
READY TO JOIN IF ONLY IN THE CHARACTER OF A DRUNKEN AND DISAPPOINTED
LOVER HE MAY BE ALLOWED TO SING THE PRAISES OF SOCRATES
HE BEGINS BY COMPARING SOCRATES FIRST TO THE BUSTS OF SILENUS WHICH
HAVE IMAGES OF THE GODS INSIDE THEM AND SECONDLY TO MARSYAS THE
FLUTE PLAYER
FOR SOCRATES PRODUCES THE SAME EFFECT WITH THE VOICE WHICH
MARSYAS DID WITH THE FLUTE
HE IS THE GREAT SPEAKER AND ENCHANTER
WHO RAVISHES THE SOULS OF MEN THE CONVINCER OF HEARTS TOO AS HE HAS
CONVINCED ALCIBIADES AND MADE HIM ASHAMED OF HIS MEAN AND MISERABLE
LIFE
SOCRATES AT ONE TIME SEEMED ABOUT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM AND HE
THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD THEREBY GAIN A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY OF RECEIVING
LESSONS OF WISDOM
HE NARRATES THE FAILURE OF HIS DESIGN
HE HAS
SUFFERED AGONIES FROM HIM AND IS AT HIS WIT'S END
HE THEN PROCEEDS TO
MENTION SOME OTHER PARTICULARS OF THE LIFE OF SOCRATES HOW THEY WERE AT
POTIDAEA TOGETHER WHERE SOCRATES SHOWED HIS SUPERIOR POWERS OF ENDURING
COLD AND FATIGUE HOW ON ONE OCCASION HE HAD STOOD FOR AN ENTIRE DAY AND
NIGHT ABSORBED IN REFLECTION AMID THE WONDER OF THE SPECTATORS HOW ON
ANOTHER OCCASION HE HAD SAVED ALCIBIADES' LIFE HOW AT THE BATTLE
OF DELIUM AFTER THE DEFEAT HE MIGHT BE SEEN STALKING ABOUT LIKE A
PELICAN ROLLING HIS EYES AS ARISTOPHANES HAD DESCRIBED HIM IN THE
CLOUDS
HE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL OF HUMAN BEINGS AND ABSOLUTELY UNLIKE
ANYONE BUT A SATYR
LIKE THE SATYR IN HIS LANGUAGE TOO FOR HE USES THE
COMMONEST WORDS AS THE OUTWARD MASK OF THE DIVINEST TRUTHS
WHEN ALCIBIADES HAS DONE SPEAKING A DISPUTE BEGINS BETWEEN HIM
AND AGATHON AND SOCRATES
SOCRATES PIQUES ALCIBIADES BY A PRETENDED
AFFECTION FOR AGATHON
PRESENTLY A BAND OF REVELLERS APPEARS WHO
INTRODUCE DISORDER INTO THE FEAST THE SOBER PART OF THE COMPANY
ERYXIMACHUS PHAEDRUS AND OTHERS WITHDRAW AND ARISTODEMUS THE
FOLLOWER OF SOCRATES SLEEPS DURING THE WHOLE OF A LONG WINTER'S NIGHT
WHEN HE WAKES AT COCKCROW THE REVELLERS ARE NEARLY ALL ASLEEP
ONLY
SOCRATES ARISTOPHANES AND AGATHON HOLD OUT THEY ARE DRINKING FROM A
LARGE GOBLET WHICH THEY PASS ROUND AND SOCRATES IS EXPLAINING TO THE
TWO OTHERS WHO ARE HALF ASLEEP THAT THE GENIUS OF TRAGEDY IS THE SAME
AS THAT OF COMEDY AND THAT THE WRITER OF TRAGEDY OUGHT TO BE A WRITER
OF COMEDY ALSO
AND FIRST ARISTOPHANES DROPS AND THEN AS THE DAY IS
DAWNING AGATHON
SOCRATES HAVING LAID THEM TO REST TAKES A BATH AND
GOES TO HIS DAILY AVOCATIONS UNTIL THE EVENING
ARISTODEMUS FOLLOWS
IF IT BE TRUE THAT THERE ARE MORE THINGS IN THE SYMPOSIUM OF PLATO THAN
ANY COMMENTATOR HAS DREAMED OF IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT MANY THINGS HAVE
BEEN IMAGINED WHICH ARE NOT REALLY TO BE FOUND THERE
SOME WRITINGS
HARDLY ADMIT OF A MORE DISTINCT INTERPRETATION THAN A MUSICAL
COMPOSITION AND EVERY READER MAY FORM HIS OWN ACCOMPANIMENT OF THOUGHT
OR FEELING TO THE STRAIN WHICH HE HEARS
THE SYMPOSIUM OF PLATO IS A
WORK OF THIS CHARACTER AND CAN WITH DIFFICULTY BE RENDERED IN ANY WORDS
BUT THE WRITER'S OWN
THERE ARE SO MANY HALF LIGHTS AND CROSS LIGHTS
SO MUCH OF THE COLOUR OF MYTHOLOGY AND OF THE MANNER OF SOPHISTRY
ADHERING RHETORIC AND POETRY THE PLAYFUL AND THE SERIOUS ARE SO
SUBTLY INTERMINGLED IN IT AND VESTIGES OF OLD PHILOSOPHY SO CURIOUSLY
BLEND WITH GERMS OF FUTURE KNOWLEDGE THAT AGREEMENT AMONG INTERPRETERS
IS NOT TO BE EXPECTED
THE EXPRESSION 'POEMA MAGIS PUTANDUM QUAM
COMICORUM POETARUM WHICH HAS BEEN APPLIED TO ALL THE WRITINGS OF
PLATO IS ESPECIALLY APPLICABLE TO THE SYMPOSIUM
THE POWER OF LOVE IS REPRESENTED IN THE SYMPOSIUM AS RUNNING THROUGH ALL
NATURE AND ALL BEING AT ONE END DESCENDING TO ANIMALS AND PLANTS AND
ATTAINING TO THE HIGHEST VISION OF TRUTH AT THE OTHER
IN AN AGE
WHEN MAN WAS SEEKING FOR AN EXPRESSION OF THE WORLD AROUND HIM THE
CONCEPTION OF LOVE GREATLY AFFECTED HIM
ONE OF THE FIRST DISTINCTIONS
OF LANGUAGE AND OF MYTHOLOGY WAS THAT OF GENDER AND AT A LATER PERIOD
THE ANCIENT PHYSICIST ANTICIPATING MODERN SCIENCE SAW OR THOUGHT
THAT HE SAW A SEX IN PLANTS THERE WERE ELECTIVE AFFINITIES AMONG THE
ELEMENTS MARRIAGES OF EARTH AND HEAVEN
AESCH
FRAG
DAN LOVE BECAME
A MYTHIC PERSONAGE WHOM PHILOSOPHY BORROWING FROM POETRY CONVERTED
INTO AN EFFICIENT CAUSE OF CREATION
THE TRACES OF THE EXISTENCE OF
LOVE AS OF NUMBER AND FIGURE WERE EVERYWHERE DISCERNED AND IN THE
PYTHAGOREAN LIST OF OPPOSITES MALE AND FEMALE WERE RANGED SIDE BY SIDE
WITH ODD AND EVEN FINITE AND INFINITE
BUT PLATO SEEMS ALSO TO BE AWARE THAT THERE IS A MYSTERY OF LOVE IN MAN
AS WELL AS IN NATURE EXTENDING BEYOND THE MERE IMMEDIATE RELATION OF
THE SEXES
HE IS CONSCIOUS THAT THE HIGHEST AND NOBLEST THINGS IN THE
WORLD ARE NOT EASILY SEVERED FROM THE SENSUAL DESIRES OR MAY EVEN BE
REGARDED AS A SPIRITUALIZED FORM OF THEM
WE MAY OBSERVE THAT SOCRATES
HIMSELF IS NOT REPRESENTED AS ORIGINALLY UNIMPASSIONED BUT AS ONE WHO
HAS OVERCOME HIS PASSIONS THE SECRET OF HIS POWER OVER OTHERS PARTLY
LIES IN HIS PASSIONATE BUT SELF CONTROLLED NATURE
IN THE PHAEDRUS AND
SYMPOSIUM LOVE IS NOT MERELY THE FEELING USUALLY SO CALLED BUT THE
MYSTICAL CONTEMPLATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE GOOD
THE SAME PASSION
WHICH MAY WALLOW IN THE MIRE IS CAPABLE OF RISING TO THE LOFTIEST
HEIGHTS OF PENETRATING THE INMOST SECRET OF PHILOSOPHY
THE HIGHEST
LOVE IS THE LOVE NOT OF A PERSON BUT OF THE HIGHEST AND PUREST
ABSTRACTION
THIS ABSTRACTION IS THE FAR OFF HEAVEN ON WHICH THE EYE OF
THE MIND IS FIXED IN FOND AMAZEMENT
THE UNITY OF TRUTH THE CONSISTENCY
OF THE WARRING ELEMENTS OF THE WORLD THE ENTHUSIASM FOR KNOWLEDGE WHEN
FIRST BEAMING UPON MANKIND THE RELATIVITY OF IDEAS TO THE HUMAN
MIND AND OF THE HUMAN MIND TO IDEAS THE FAITH IN THE INVISIBLE
THE ADORATION OF THE ETERNAL NATURE ARE ALL INCLUDED CONSCIOUSLY OR
UNCONSCIOUSLY IN PLATO'S DOCTRINE OF LOVE
THE SUCCESSIVE SPEECHES IN PRAISE OF LOVE ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE
SPEAKERS AND CONTRIBUTE IN VARIOUS DEGREES TO THE FINAL RESULT THEY
ARE ALL DESIGNED TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR SOCRATES WHO GATHERS UP THE
THREADS ANEW AND SKIMS THE HIGHEST POINTS OF EACH OF THEM
BUT THEY ARE
NOT TO BE REGARDED AS THE STAGES OF AN IDEA RISING ABOVE ONE ANOTHER
TO A CLIMAX
THEY ARE FANCIFUL PARTLY FACETIOUS PERFORMANCES 'YET ALSO
HAVING A CERTAIN MEASURE OF SERIOUSNESS WHICH THE SUCCESSIVE SPEAKERS
DEDICATE TO THE GOD
ALL OF THEM ARE RHETORICAL AND POETICAL RATHER THAN
DIALECTICAL BUT GLIMPSES OF TRUTH APPEAR IN THEM
WHEN ERYXIMACHUS SAYS
THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF MUSIC ARE SIMPLE IN THEMSELVES BUT CONFUSED
IN THEIR APPLICATION HE TOUCHES LIGHTLY UPON A DIFFICULTY WHICH HAS
TROUBLED THE MODERNS AS WELL AS THE ANCIENTS IN MUSIC AND MAY BE
EXTENDED TO THE OTHER APPLIED SCIENCES
THAT CONFUSION BEGINS IN THE
CONCRETE WAS THE NATURAL FEELING OF A MIND DWELLING IN THE WORLD OF
IDEAS
WHEN PAUSANIAS REMARKS THAT PERSONAL ATTACHMENTS ARE INIMICAL
TO DESPOTS
THE EXPERIENCE OF GREEK HISTORY CONFIRMS THE TRUTH OF HIS
REMARK
WHEN ARISTOPHANES DECLARES THAT LOVE IS THE DESIRE OF THE WHOLE
HE EXPRESSES A FEELING NOT UNLIKE THAT OF THE GERMAN PHILOSOPHER WHO
SAYS THAT 'PHILOSOPHY IS HOME SICKNESS WHEN AGATHON SAYS THAT NO MAN
'CAN BE WRONGED OF HIS OWN FREE WILL HE IS ALLUDING PLAYFULLY TO A
SERIOUS PROBLEM OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY COMPARE ARIST
NIC
ETHICS
SO
NATURALLY DOES PLATO MINGLE JEST AND EARNEST TRUTH AND OPINION IN THE
SAME WORK
THE CHARACTERS OF PHAEDRUS WHO HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF MORE
PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSIONS THAN ANY OTHER MAN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
SIMMIAS THE THEBAN PHAEDRUS OF ARISTOPHANES WHO DISGUISES UNDER
COMIC IMAGERY A SERIOUS PURPOSE OF AGATHON WHO IN LATER LIFE IS
SATIRIZED BY ARISTOPHANES IN THE THESMOPHORIAZUSAE FOR HIS EFFEMINATE
MANNERS AND THE FEEBLE RHYTHMS OF HIS VERSE OF ALCIBIADES WHO IS THE
SAME STRANGE CONTRAST OF GREAT POWERS AND GREAT VICES WHICH MEETS US
IN HISTORY ARE DRAWN TO THE LIFE AND WE MAY SUPPOSE THE LESS KNOWN
CHARACTERS OF PAUSANIAS AND ERYXIMACHUS TO BE ALSO TRUE TO THE
TRADITIONAL RECOLLECTION OF THEM COMPARE PHAEDR PROTAG AND COMPARE
SYMPOS
WITH PHAEDR
WE MAY ALSO REMARK THAT ARISTODEMUS IS CALLED
'THE LITTLE' IN XENOPHON'S MEMORABILIA COMPARE SYMP
THE SPEECHES HAVE BEEN SAID TO FOLLOW EACH OTHER IN PAIRS PHAEDRUS AND
PAUSANIAS BEING THE ETHICAL ERYXIMACHUS AND ARISTOPHANES THE PHYSICAL
SPEAKERS WHILE IN AGATHON AND SOCRATES POETRY AND PHILOSOPHY BLEND
TOGETHER
THE SPEECH OF PHAEDRUS IS ALSO DESCRIBED AS THE MYTHOLOGICAL
THAT OF PAUSANIAS AS THE POLITICAL THAT OF ERYXIMACHUS AS THE
SCIENTIFIC THAT OF ARISTOPHANES AS THE ARTISTIC THAT OF SOCRATES
AS THE PHILOSOPHICAL
BUT THESE AND SIMILAR DISTINCTIONS ARE NOT FOUND
IN PLATO THEY ARE THE POINTS OF VIEW OF HIS CRITICS AND SEEM TO
IMPEDE RATHER THAN TO ASSIST US IN UNDERSTANDING HIM
WHEN THE TURN OF SOCRATES COMES ROUND HE CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO DISTURB
THE ARRANGEMENT MADE AT FIRST
WITH THE LEAVE OF PHAEDRUS HE ASKS A FEW
QUESTIONS AND THEN HE THROWS HIS ARGUMENT INTO THE FORM OF A SPEECH
COMPARE GORG PROTAG
BUT HIS SPEECH IS REALLY THE NARRATIVE OF A
DIALOGUE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND DIOTIMA
AND AS AT A BANQUET GOOD MANNERS
WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO WIN A VICTORY EITHER OVER HIS HOST OR ANY OF
THE GUESTS THE SUPERIORITY WHICH HE GAINS OVER AGATHON IS INGENIOUSLY
REPRESENTED AS HAVING BEEN ALREADY GAINED OVER HIMSELF BY HER
THE
ARTIFICE HAS THE FURTHER ADVANTAGE OF MAINTAINING HIS ACCUSTOMED
PROFESSION OF IGNORANCE COMPARE MENEX
EVEN HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE
MYSTERIES OF LOVE TO WHICH HE LAYS CLAIM HERE AND ELSEWHERE LYS IS
GIVEN BY DIOTIMA
THE SPEECHES ARE ATTESTED TO US BY THE VERY BEST AUTHORITY
THE MADMAN
APOLLODORUS WHO FOR THREE YEARS PAST HAS MADE A DAILY STUDY OF THE
ACTIONS OF SOCRATES TO WHOM THE WORLD IS SUMMED UP IN THE WORDS 'GREAT
IS SOCRATES' HE HAS HEARD THEM FROM ANOTHER 'MADMAN ARISTODEMUS
WHO WAS THE 'SHADOW' OF SOCRATES IN DAYS OF OLD LIKE HIM GOING ABOUT
BAREFOOTED AND WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE TIME
'WOULD YOU DESIRE
BETTER WITNESS THE EXTRAORDINARY NARRATIVE OF ALCIBIADES IS
INGENIOUSLY REPRESENTED AS ADMITTED BY SOCRATES WHOSE SILENCE WHEN HE
IS INVITED TO CONTRADICT GIVES CONSENT TO THE NARRATOR
WE MAY OBSERVE
BY THE WAY 1 HOW THE VERY APPEARANCE OF ARISTODEMUS BY HIMSELF IS
A SUFFICIENT INDICATION TO AGATHON THAT SOCRATES HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND
ALSO 2 HOW THE COURTESY OF AGATHON ANTICIPATES THE EXCUSE WHICH
SOCRATES WAS TO HAVE MADE ON ARISTODEMUS' BEHALF FOR COMING UNINVITED
3 HOW THE STORY OF THE FIT OR TRANCE OF SOCRATES IS CONFIRMED BY THE
MENTION WHICH ALCIBIADES MAKES OF A SIMILAR FIT OF ABSTRACTION OCCURRING
WHEN HE WAS SERVING WITH THE ARMY AT POTIDAEA LIKE 4 THE DRINKING
POWERS OF SOCRATES AND HIS LOVE OF THE FAIR WHICH RECEIVE A SIMILAR
ATTESTATION IN THE CONCLUDING SCENE OR THE ATTACHMENT OF ARISTODEMUS
WHO IS NOT FORGOTTEN WHEN SOCRATES TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
5 WE MAY
NOTICE THE MANNER IN WHICH SOCRATES HIMSELF REGARDS THE FIRST FIVE
SPEECHES NOT AS TRUE BUT AS FANCIFUL AND EXAGGERATED ENCOMIUMS OF THE
GOD LOVE 6 THE SATIRICAL CHARACTER OF THEM SHOWN ESPECIALLY IN
THE APPEALS TO MYTHOLOGY IN THE REASONS WHICH ARE GIVEN BY ZEUS FOR
RECONSTRUCTING THE FRAME OF MAN OR BY THE BOEOTIANS AND ELEANS
FOR ENCOURAGING MALE LOVES 7 THE RULING PASSION OF SOCRATES FOR
DIALECTICS WHO WILL ARGUE WITH AGATHON INSTEAD OF MAKING A SPEECH AND
WILL ONLY SPEAK AT ALL UPON THE CONDITION THAT HE IS ALLOWED TO SPEAK
THE TRUTH
WE MAY NOTE ALSO THE TOUCH OF SOCRATIC IRONY 8 WHICH
ADMITS OF A WIDE APPLICATION AND REVEALS A DEEP INSIGHT INTO THE
WORLD THAT IN SPEAKING OF HOLY THINGS AND PERSONS THERE IS A GENERAL
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU SHOULD PRAISE THEM NOT THAT YOU SHOULD SPEAK THE
TRUTH ABOUT THEM THIS IS THE SORT OF PRAISE WHICH SOCRATES IS UNABLE TO
GIVE
LASTLY 9 WE MAY REMARK THAT THE BANQUET IS A REAL BANQUET AFTER
ALL AT WHICH LOVE IS THE THEME OF DISCOURSE AND HUGE QUANTITIES OF
WINE ARE DRUNK
THE DISCOURSE OF PHAEDRUS IS HALF MYTHICAL HALF ETHICAL AND HE
HIMSELF TRUE TO THE CHARACTER WHICH IS GIVEN HIM IN THE DIALOGUE
BEARING HIS NAME IS HALF SOPHIST HALF ENTHUSIAST
HE IS THE CRITIC
OF POETRY ALSO WHO COMPARES HOMER AND AESCHYLUS IN THE INSIPID
AND IRRATIONAL MANNER OF THE SCHOOLS OF THE DAY CHARACTERISTICALLY
REASONING ABOUT THE PROBABILITY OF MATTERS WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF
REASONING
HE STARTS FROM A NOBLE TEXT 'THAT WITHOUT THE SENSE OF
HONOUR AND DISHONOUR NEITHER STATES NOR INDIVIDUALS EVER DO ANY GOOD
OR GREAT WORK BUT HE SOON PASSES ON TO MORE COMMON PLACE TOPICS
THE
ANTIQUITY OF LOVE THE BLESSING OF HAVING A LOVER THE INCENTIVE WHICH
LOVE OFFERS TO DARING DEEDS THE EXAMPLES OF ALCESTIS AND ACHILLES ARE
THE CHIEF THEMES OF HIS DISCOURSE
THE LOVE OF WOMEN IS REGARDED BY HIM
AS ALMOST ON AN EQUALITY WITH THAT OF MEN AND HE MAKES THE SINGULAR
REMARK THAT THE GODS FAVOUR THE RETURN OF LOVE WHICH IS MADE BY THE
BELOVED MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL SENTIMENT BECAUSE THE LOVER IS OF A
NOBLER AND DIVINER NATURE
THERE IS SOMETHING OF A SOPHISTICAL RING IN THE SPEECH OF PHAEDRUS
WHICH RECALLS THE FIRST SPEECH IN IMITATION OF LYSIAS OCCURRING IN THE
DIALOGUE CALLED THE PHAEDRUS
THIS IS STILL MORE MARKED IN THE SPEECH OF
PAUSANIAS WHICH FOLLOWS AND WHICH IS AT ONCE HYPERLOGICAL IN FORM AND
ALSO EXTREMELY CONFUSED AND PEDANTIC
PLATO IS ATTACKING THE LOGICAL
FEEBLENESS OF THE SOPHISTS AND RHETORICIANS THROUGH THEIR PUPILS NOT
FORGETTING BY THE WAY TO SATIRIZE THE MONOTONOUS AND UNMEANING RHYTHMS
WHICH PRODICUS AND OTHERS WERE INTRODUCING INTO ATTIC PROSE COMPARE
PROTAG
OF COURSE HE IS 'PLAYING BOTH SIDES OF THE GAME AS IN THE
GORGIAS AND PHAEDRUS BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HIM
THAT WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE FAIRNESS OF HIS MODE OF PROCEEDING
THE
LOVE OF PAUSANIAS FOR AGATHON HAS ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED UPON IN THE
PROTAGORAS AND IS ALLUDED TO BY ARISTOPHANES
HENCE HE IS NATURALLY THE
UPHOLDER OF MALE LOVES WHICH LIKE ALL THE OTHER AFFECTIONS OR
ACTIONS OF MEN HE REGARDS AS VARYING ACCORDING TO THE MANNER OF THEIR
PERFORMANCE
LIKE THE SOPHISTS AND LIKE PLATO HIMSELF THOUGH IN A
DIFFERENT SENSE HE BEGINS HIS DISCUSSION BY AN APPEAL TO MYTHOLOGY
AND DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THE ELDER AND YOUNGER LOVE
THE VALUE WHICH
HE ATTRIBUTES TO SUCH LOVES AS MOTIVES TO VIRTUE AND PHILOSOPHY IS AT
VARIANCE WITH MODERN AND CHRISTIAN NOTIONS BUT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH
HELLENIC SENTIMENT
THE OPINION OF CHRISTENDOM HAS NOT ALTOGETHER
CONDEMNED PASSIONATE FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX BUT
HAS CERTAINLY NOT ENCOURAGED THEM BECAUSE THOUGH INNOCENT IN THEMSELVES
IN A FEW TEMPERAMENTS THEY ARE LIABLE TO DEGENERATE INTO FEARFUL EVIL
PAUSANIAS IS VERY EARNEST IN THE DEFENCE OF SUCH LOVES AND HE SPEAKS OF
THEM AS GENERALLY APPROVED AMONG HELLENES AND DISAPPROVED BY BARBARIANS
HIS SPEECH IS 'MORE WORDS THAN MATTER AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMPOSED BY
A PUPIL OF LYSIAS OR OF PRODICUS ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO HINT GIVEN THAT
PLATO IS SPECIALLY REFERRING TO THEM
AS ERYXIMACHUS SAYS 'HE MAKES A
FAIR BEGINNING BUT A LAME ENDING
PLATO TRANSPOSES THE TWO NEXT SPEECHES AS IN THE REPUBLIC HE WOULD
TRANSPOSE THE VIRTUES AND THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
THIS IS DONE PARTLY
TO AVOID MONOTONY PARTLY FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING ARISTOPHANES 'THE CAUSE
OF WIT IN OTHERS AND ALSO IN ORDER TO BRING THE COMIC AND TRAGIC
POET INTO JUXTAPOSITION AS IF BY ACCIDENT
A SUITABLE 'EXPECTATION' OF
ARISTOPHANES IS RAISED BY THE LUDICROUS CIRCUMSTANCE OF HIS HAVING THE
HICCOUGH WHICH IS APPROPRIATELY CURED BY HIS SUBSTITUTE THE PHYSICIAN
ERYXIMACHUS
TO ERYXIMACHUS LOVE IS THE GOOD PHYSICIAN HE SEES
EVERYTHING AS AN INTELLIGENT PHYSICIST AND LIKE MANY PROFESSORS OF HIS
ART IN MODERN TIMES ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE THE MORAL TO THE PHYSICAL OR
RECOGNISES ONE LAW OF LOVE WHICH PERVADES THEM BOTH
THERE ARE LOVES
AND STRIFES OF THE BODY AS WELL AS OF THE MIND
LIKE HIPPOCRATES THE
ASCLEPIAD HE IS A DISCIPLE OF HERACLEITUS WHOSE CONCEPTION OF THE
HARMONY OF OPPOSITES HE EXPLAINS IN A NEW WAY AS THE HARMONY AFTER
DISCORD TO HIS COMMON SENSE AS TO THAT OF MANY MODERNS AS WELL AS
ANCIENTS THE IDENTITY OF CONTRADICTORIES IS AN ABSURDITY
HIS NOTION OF
LOVE MAY BE SUMMED UP AS THE HARMONY OF MAN WITH HIMSELF IN SOUL AS WELL
AS BODY AND OF ALL THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH WITH ONE ANOTHER
ARISTOPHANES IS READY TO LAUGH AND MAKE LAUGH BEFORE HE OPENS HIS MOUTH
JUST AS SOCRATES TRUE TO HIS CHARACTER IS READY TO ARGUE BEFORE HE
BEGINS TO SPEAK
HE EXPRESSES THE VERY GENIUS OF THE OLD COMEDY ITS
COARSE AND FORCIBLE IMAGERY AND THE LICENCE OF ITS LANGUAGE IN SPEAKING
ABOUT THE GODS
HE HAS NO SOPHISTICAL NOTIONS ABOUT LOVE WHICH
IS BROUGHT BACK BY HIM TO ITS COMMON SENSE MEANING OF LOVE BETWEEN
INTELLIGENT BEINGS
HIS ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE SEXES HAS THE
GREATEST COMIC PROBABILITY AND VERISIMILITUDE
NOTHING IN ARISTOPHANES
IS MORE TRULY ARISTOPHANIC THAN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE HUMAN MONSTER
WHIRLING ROUND ON FOUR ARMS AND FOUR LEGS EIGHT IN ALL WITH INCREDIBLE
RAPIDITY
YET THERE IS A MIXTURE OF EARNESTNESS IN THIS JEST THREE
SERIOUS PRINCIPLES SEEM TO BE INSINUATED FIRST THAT MAN CANNOT EXIST
IN ISOLATION HE MUST BE REUNITED IF HE IS TO BE PERFECTED SECONDLY
THAT LOVE IS THE MEDIATOR AND RECONCILER OF POOR DIVIDED HUMAN NATURE
THIRDLY THAT THE LOVES OF THIS WORLD ARE AN INDISTINCT ANTICIPATION OF
AN IDEAL UNION WHICH IS NOT YET REALIZED
THE SPEECH OF AGATHON IS CONCEIVED IN A HIGHER STRAIN AND RECEIVES THE
REAL IF HALF IRONICAL APPROVAL OF SOCRATES
IT IS THE SPEECH OF THE
TRAGIC POET AND A SORT OF POEM LIKE TRAGEDY MOVING AMONG THE GODS OF
OLYMPUS AND NOT AMONG THE ELDER OR ORPHIC DEITIES
IN THE IDEA OF THE
ANTIQUITY OF LOVE HE CANNOT AGREE LOVE IS NOT OF THE OLDEN TIME BUT
PRESENT AND YOUTHFUL EVER
THE SPEECH MAY BE COMPARED WITH THAT SPEECH
OF SOCRATES IN THE PHAEDRUS IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS TALKING
DITHYRAMBS
IT IS AT ONCE A PREPARATION FOR SOCRATES AND A FOIL TO HIM
THE RHETORIC OF AGATHON ELEVATES THE SOUL TO 'SUNLIT HEIGHTS BUT AT
THE SAME TIME CONTRASTS WITH THE NATURAL AND NECESSARY ELOQUENCE OF
SOCRATES
AGATHON CONTRIBUTES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LOVE AND THE WORKS
OF LOVE AND ALSO HINTS INCIDENTALLY THAT LOVE IS ALWAYS OF BEAUTY
WHICH SOCRATES AFTERWARDS RAISES INTO A PRINCIPLE
WHILE THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF DISCORD IS STRONGER IN THE COMIC POET ARISTOPHANES
AGATHON THE TRAGIC POET HAS A DEEPER SENSE OF HARMONY AND
RECONCILIATION AND SPEAKS OF LOVE AS THE CREATOR AND ARTIST
ALL THE EARLIER SPEECHES EMBODY COMMON OPINIONS COLOURED WITH A TINGE OF
PHILOSOPHY
THEY FURNISH THE MATERIAL OUT OF WHICH SOCRATES PROCEEDS TO
FORM HIS DISCOURSE STARTING AS IN OTHER PLACES FROM MYTHOLOGY AND
THE OPINIONS OF MEN
FROM PHAEDRUS HE TAKES THE THOUGHT THAT LOVE IS
STRONGER THAN DEATH FROM PAUSANIAS THAT THE TRUE LOVE IS AKIN TO
INTELLECT AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY FROM ERYXIMACHUS THAT LOVE IS A
UNIVERSAL PHENOMENON AND THE GREAT POWER OF NATURE FROM ARISTOPHANES
THAT LOVE IS THE CHILD OF WANT AND IS NOT MERELY THE LOVE OF THE
CONGENIAL OR OF THE WHOLE BUT AS HE ADDS OF THE GOOD FROM AGATHON
THAT LOVE IS OF BEAUTY NOT HOWEVER OF BEAUTY ONLY BUT OF BIRTH
IN BEAUTY
AS IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR SOCRATES TO MAKE A
LENGTHENED HARANGUE THE SPEECH TAKES THE FORM OF A DIALOGUE BETWEEN
SOCRATES AND A MYSTERIOUS WOMAN OF FOREIGN EXTRACTION
SHE ELICITS THE
FINAL TRUTH FROM ONE WHO KNOWS NOTHING AND WHO SPEAKING BY THE LIPS
OF ANOTHER AND HIMSELF A DESPISER OF RHETORIC IS PROVED ALSO TO BE THE
MOST CONSUMMATE OF RHETORICIANS COMPARE MENEXENUS
THE LAST OF THE SIX DISCOURSES BEGINS WITH A SHORT ARGUMENT WHICH
OVERTHROWS NOT ONLY AGATHON BUT ALL THE PRECEDING SPEAKERS BY THE HELP
OF A DISTINCTION WHICH HAS ESCAPED THEM
EXTRAVAGANT PRAISES HAVE BEEN
ASCRIBED TO LOVE AS THE AUTHOR OF EVERY GOOD NO SORT OF ENCOMIUM WAS
TOO HIGH FOR HIM WHETHER DESERVED AND TRUE OR NOT
BUT SOCRATES HAS NO
TALENT FOR SPEAKING ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH AND IF HE IS TO SPEAK THE
TRUTH OF LOVE HE MUST HONESTLY CONFESS THAT HE IS NOT A GOOD AT ALL FOR
LOVE IS OF THE GOOD AND NO MAN CAN DESIRE THAT WHICH HE HAS
THIS
PIECE OF DIALECTICS IS ASCRIBED TO DIOTIMA WHO HAS ALREADY URGED
UPON SOCRATES THE ARGUMENT WHICH HE URGES AGAINST AGATHON
THAT THE
DISTINCTION IS A FALLACY IS OBVIOUS IT IS ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE SO
BY SOCRATES HIMSELF
FOR HE WHO HAS BEAUTY OR GOOD MAY DESIRE MORE OF
THEM AND HE WHO HAS BEAUTY OR GOOD IN HIMSELF MAY DESIRE BEAUTY AND
GOOD IN OTHERS
THE FALLACY SEEMS TO ARISE OUT OF A CONFUSION BETWEEN
THE ABSTRACT IDEAS OF GOOD AND BEAUTY WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF DEGREES
AND THEIR PARTIAL REALIZATION IN INDIVIDUALS
BUT DIOTIMA THE PROPHETESS OF MANTINEIA WHOSE SACRED AND SUPERHUMAN
CHARACTER RAISES HER ABOVE THE ORDINARY PROPRIETIES OF WOMEN HAS TAUGHT
SOCRATES FAR MORE THAN THIS ABOUT THE ART AND MYSTERY OF LOVE
SHE HAS
TAUGHT HIM THAT LOVE IS ANOTHER ASPECT OF PHILOSOPHY
THE SAME WANT IN
THE HUMAN SOUL WHICH IS SATISFIED IN THE VULGAR BY THE PROCREATION OF
CHILDREN MAY BECOME THE HIGHEST ASPIRATION OF INTELLECTUAL DESIRE
AS THE CHRISTIAN MIGHT SPEAK OF HUNGERING AND THIRSTING AFTER
RIGHTEOUSNESS OR OF DIVINE LOVES UNDER THE FIGURE OF HUMAN COMPARE
EPH
'THIS IS A GREAT MYSTERY BUT I SPEAK CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE
CHURCH' AS THE MEDIAEVAL SAINT MIGHT SPEAK OF THE 'FRUITIO DEI AS
DANTE SAW ALL THINGS CONTAINED IN HIS LOVE OF BEATRICE SO PLATO WOULD
HAVE US ABSORB ALL OTHER LOVES AND DESIRES IN THE LOVE OF KNOWLEDGE
HERE IS THE BEGINNING OF NEOPLATONISM OR RATHER PERHAPS A PROOF OF
WHICH THERE ARE MANY THAT THE SO CALLED MYSTICISM OF THE EAST WAS
NOT STRANGE TO THE GREEK OF THE FIFTH CENTURY BEFORE CHRIST
THE FIRST
TUMULT OF THE AFFECTIONS WAS NOT WHOLLY SUBDUED THERE WERE LONGINGS OF
A CREATURE MOVING ABOUT IN WORLDS NOT REALIZED WHICH NO ART COULD
SATISFY
TO MOST MEN REASON AND PASSION APPEAR TO BE ANTAGONISTIC BOTH
IN IDEA AND FACT
THE UNION OF THE GREATEST COMPREHENSION OF KNOWLEDGE
AND THE BURNING INTENSITY OF LOVE IS A CONTRADICTION IN NATURE WHICH
MAY HAVE EXISTED IN A FAR OFF PRIMEVAL AGE IN THE MIND OF SOME HEBREW
PROPHET OR OTHER EASTERN SAGE BUT HAS NOW BECOME AN IMAGINATION ONLY
YET THIS 'PASSION OF THE REASON' IS THE THEME OF THE SYMPOSIUM OF PLATO
AND AS THERE IS NO IMPOSSIBILITY IN SUPPOSING THAT 'ONE KING OR SON OF
A KING MAY BE A PHILOSOPHER SO ALSO THERE IS A PROBABILITY THAT THERE
MAY BE SOME FEW PERHAPS ONE OR TWO IN A WHOLE GENERATION IN WHOM THE
LIGHT OF TRUTH MAY NOT LACK THE WARMTH OF DESIRE
AND IF THERE BE SUCH
NATURES NO ONE WILL BE DISPOSED TO DENY THAT 'FROM THEM FLOW MOST OF
THE BENEFITS OF INDIVIDUALS AND STATES AND EVEN FROM IMPERFECT
COMBINATIONS OF THE TWO ELEMENTS IN TEACHERS OR STATESMEN GREAT GOOD MAY
OFTEN ARISE
YET THERE IS A HIGHER REGION IN WHICH LOVE IS NOT ONLY FELT BUT
SATISFIED IN THE PERFECT BEAUTY OF ETERNAL KNOWLEDGE BEGINNING WITH
THE BEAUTY OF EARTHLY THINGS AND AT LAST REACHING A BEAUTY IN WHICH
ALL EXISTENCE IS SEEN TO BE HARMONIOUS AND ONE
THE LIMITED AFFECTION
IS ENLARGED AND ENABLED TO BEHOLD THE IDEAL OF ALL THINGS
AND HERE THE
HIGHEST SUMMIT WHICH IS REACHED IN THE SYMPOSIUM IS SEEN ALSO TO BE THE
HIGHEST SUMMIT WHICH IS ATTAINED IN THE REPUBLIC BUT APPROACHED FROM
ANOTHER SIDE AND THERE IS 'A WAY UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS WHICH IS THE
SAME AND NOT THE SAME IN BOTH
THE IDEAL BEAUTY OF THE ONE IS THE IDEAL
GOOD OF THE OTHER REGARDED NOT WITH THE EYE OF KNOWLEDGE BUT OF FAITH
AND DESIRE AND THEY ARE RESPECTIVELY THE SOURCE OF BEAUTY AND THE
SOURCE OF GOOD IN ALL OTHER THINGS
AND BY THE STEPS OF A 'LADDER
REACHING TO HEAVEN' WE PASS FROM IMAGES OF VISIBLE BEAUTY GREEK AND
FROM THE HYPOTHESES OF THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES WHICH ARE NOT YET
BASED UPON THE IDEA OF GOOD THROUGH THE CONCRETE TO THE ABSTRACT AND
BY DIFFERENT PATHS ARRIVING BEHOLD THE VISION OF THE ETERNAL COMPARE
SYMP
GREEK REPUBLIC GREEK ALSO PHAEDRUS
UNDER ONE ASPECT 'THE
IDEA IS LOVE' UNDER ANOTHER 'TRUTH IN BOTH THE LOVER OF WISDOM IS
THE 'SPECTATOR OF ALL TIME AND OF ALL EXISTENCE THIS IS A 'MYSTERY'
IN WHICH PLATO ALSO OBSCURELY INTIMATES THE UNION OF THE SPIRITUAL AND
FLESHLY THE INTERPENETRATION OF THE MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL FACULTIES
THE DIVINE IMAGE OF BEAUTY WHICH RESIDES WITHIN SOCRATES HAS BEEN
REVEALED THE SILENUS OR OUTWARD MAN HAS NOW TO BE EXHIBITED
THE DESCRIPTION OF SOCRATES FOLLOWS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SPEECH OF
SOCRATES ONE IS THE COMPLEMENT OF THE OTHER
AT THE HEIGHT OF DIVINE
INSPIRATION WHEN THE FORCE OF NATURE CAN NO FURTHER GO BY WAY OF
CONTRAST TO THIS EXTREME IDEALISM ALCIBIADES ACCOMPANIED BY A TROOP OF
REVELLERS AND A FLUTE GIRL STAGGERS IN AND BEING DRUNK IS ABLE TO TELL
OF THINGS WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO MAKE KNOWN IF HE HAD BEEN
SOBER
THE STATE OF HIS AFFECTIONS TOWARDS SOCRATES UNINTELLIGIBLE TO
US AND PERVERTED AS THEY APPEAR AFFORDS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE POWER
ASCRIBED TO THE LOVES OF MAN IN THE SPEECH OF PAUSANIAS
HE DOES NOT
SUPPOSE HIS FEELINGS TO BE PECULIAR TO HIMSELF THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER
PERSONS IN THE COMPANY WHO HAVE BEEN EQUALLY IN LOVE WITH SOCRATES
AND LIKE HIMSELF HAVE BEEN DECEIVED BY HIM
THE SINGULAR PART OF THIS
CONFESSION IS THE COMBINATION OF THE MOST DEGRADING PASSION WITH THE
DESIRE OF VIRTUE AND IMPROVEMENT
SUCH AN UNION IS NOT WHOLLY UNTRUE TO
HUMAN NATURE WHICH IS CAPABLE OF COMBINING GOOD AND EVIL IN A DEGREE
BEYOND WHAT WE CAN EASILY CONCEIVE
IN IMAGINATIVE PERSONS ESPECIALLY
THE GOD AND BEAST IN MAN SEEM TO PART ASUNDER MORE THAN IS NATURAL IN
A WELL REGULATED MIND
THE PLATONIC SOCRATES FOR OF THE REAL SOCRATES
THIS MAY BE DOUBTED COMPARE HIS PUBLIC REBUKE OF CRITIAS FOR HIS
SHAMEFUL LOVE OF EUTHYDEMUS IN XENOPHON MEMORABILIA DOES NOT REGARD
THE GREATEST EVIL OF GREEK LIFE AS A THING NOT TO BE SPOKEN OF BUT IT
HAS A RIDICULOUS ELEMENT PLATO'S SYMP AND IS A SUBJECT FOR IRONY NO
LESS THAN FOR MORAL REPROBATION COMPARE PLATO'S SYMP
IT IS ALSO USED
AS A FIGURE OF SPEECH WHICH NO ONE INTERPRETED LITERALLY COMPARE XEN
SYMP
NOR DOES PLATO FEEL ANY REPUGNANCE SUCH AS WOULD BE FELT IN
MODERN TIMES AT BRINGING HIS GREAT MASTER AND HERO INTO CONNEXION WITH
NAMELESS CRIMES
HE IS CONTENTED WITH REPRESENTING HIM AS A SAINT WHO
HAS WON 'THE OLYMPIAN VICTORY' OVER THE TEMPTATIONS OF HUMAN NATURE
THE
FAULT OF TASTE WHICH TO US IS SO GLARING AND WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED
BY THE GREEKS OF A LATER AGE ATHENAEUS WAS NOT PERCEIVED BY PLATO
HIMSELF
WE ARE STILL MORE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THE PHILOSOPHER IS
INCITED TO TAKE THE FIRST STEP IN HIS UPWARD PROGRESS SYMP BY THE
BEAUTY OF YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHICH WAS ALONE CAPABLE OF INSPIRING THE
MODERN FEELING OF ROMANCE IN THE GREEK MIND
THE PASSION OF LOVE TOOK
THE SPURIOUS FORM OF AN ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IDEAL OF BEAUTY A WORSHIP
AS OF SOME GODLIKE IMAGE OF AN APOLLO OR ANTINOUS
BUT THE LOVE OF YOUTH
WHEN NOT DEPRAVED WAS A LOVE OF VIRTUE AND MODESTY AS WELL AS OF BEAUTY
THE ONE BEING THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER AND IN CERTAIN GREEK STATES
ESPECIALLY AT SPARTA AND THEBES THE HONOURABLE ATTACHMENT OF A YOUTH TO
AN ELDER MAN WAS A PART OF HIS EDUCATION
THE 'ARMY OF LOVERS AND THEIR
BELOVED WHO WOULD BE INVINCIBLE IF THEY COULD BE UNITED BY SUCH A TIE'
SYMP IS NOT A MERE FICTION OF PLATO'S BUT SEEMS ACTUALLY TO HAVE
EXISTED AT THEBES IN THE DAYS OF EPAMINONDAS AND PELOPIDAS IF WE
MAY BELIEVE WRITERS CITED ANONYMOUSLY BY PLUTARCH PELOP
VIT
IT IS
OBSERVABLE THAT PLATO NEVER IN THE LEAST DEGREE EXCUSES THE DEPRAVED
LOVE OF THE BODY COMPARE CHARM REP LAWS SYMP AND ONCE MORE
XENOPHON MEM NOR IS THERE ANY GREEK WRITER OF MARK WHO CONDONES OR
APPROVES SUCH CONNEXIONS
BUT OWING PARTLY TO THE PUZZLING NATURE OF THE
SUBJECT THESE FRIENDSHIPS ARE SPOKEN OF BY PLATO IN A MANNER DIFFERENT
FROM THAT CUSTOMARY AMONG OURSELVES
TO MOST OF THEM WE SHOULD HESITATE
TO ASCRIBE ANY MORE THAN TO THE ATTACHMENT OF ACHILLES AND PATROCLUS IN
HOMER AN IMMORAL OR LICENTIOUS CHARACTER
THERE WERE MANY DOUBTLESS
TO WHOM THE LOVE OF THE FAIR MIND WAS THE NOBLEST FORM OF FRIENDSHIP
REP AND WHO DEEMED THE FRIENDSHIP OF MAN WITH MAN TO BE HIGHER
THAN THE LOVE OF WOMAN BECAUSE ALTOGETHER SEPARATED FROM THE BODILY
APPETITES
THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH ATTACHMENTS MAY BE REASONABLY
ATTRIBUTED TO THE INFERIORITY AND SECLUSION OF WOMAN AND THE WANT OF
A REAL FAMILY OR SOCIAL LIFE AND PARENTAL INFLUENCE IN HELLENIC CITIES
AND THEY WERE ENCOURAGED BY THE PRACTICE OF GYMNASTIC EXERCISES BY THE
MEETINGS OF POLITICAL CLUBS AND BY THE TIE OF MILITARY COMPANIONSHIP
THEY WERE ALSO AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION A YOUNG PERSON WAS SPECIALLY
ENTRUSTED BY HIS PARENTS TO SOME ELDER FRIEND WHO WAS EXPECTED BY THEM
TO TRAIN THEIR SON IN MANLY EXERCISES AND IN VIRTUE
IT IS NOT LIKELY
THAT A GREEK PARENT COMMITTED HIM TO A LOVER ANY MORE THAN WE SHOULD
TO A SCHOOLMASTER IN THE EXPECTATION THAT HE WOULD BE CORRUPTED BY HIM
BUT RATHER IN THE HOPE THAT HIS MORALS WOULD BE BETTER CARED FOR THAN
WAS POSSIBLE IN A GREAT HOUSEHOLD OF SLAVES
IT IS DIFFICULT TO ADDUCE THE AUTHORITY OF PLATO EITHER FOR OR AGAINST
SUCH PRACTICES OR CUSTOMS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DETERMINE
WHETHER HE IS SPEAKING OF 'THE HEAVENLY AND PHILOSOPHICAL LOVE OR
OF THE COARSE POLYHYMNIA AND HE OFTEN REFERS TO THIS E G
IN THE
SYMPOSIUM HALF IN JEST YET 'WITH A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SERIOUSNESS
WE OBSERVE THAT THEY ENTERED INTO ONE PART OF GREEK LITERATURE BUT NOT
INTO ANOTHER AND THAT THE LARGER PART IS FREE FROM SUCH ASSOCIATIONS
INDECENCY WAS AN ELEMENT OF THE LUDICROUS IN THE OLD GREEK COMEDY AS
IT HAS BEEN IN OTHER AGES AND COUNTRIES
BUT EFFEMINATE LOVE WAS ALWAYS
CONDEMNED AS WELL AS RIDICULED BY THE COMIC POETS AND IN THE NEW COMEDY
THE ALLUSIONS TO SUCH TOPICS HAVE DISAPPEARED
THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN NO
LONGER TOLERATED BY THE GREATER REFINEMENT OF THE AGE
FALSE SENTIMENT
IS FOUND IN THE LYRIC AND ELEGIAC POETS AND IN MYTHOLOGY 'THE GREATEST
OF THE GODS' REP IS NOT EXEMPT FROM EVIL IMPUTATIONS
BUT THE MORALS
OF A NATION ARE NOT TO BE JUDGED OF WHOLLY BY ITS LITERATURE
HELLAS
WAS NOT NECESSARILY MORE CORRUPTED IN THE DAYS OF THE PERSIAN AND
PELOPONNESIAN WARS OR OF PLATO AND THE ORATORS THAN ENGLAND IN THE
TIME OF FIELDING AND SMOLLETT OR FRANCE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
NO
ONE SUPPOSES CERTAIN FRENCH NOVELS TO BE A REPRESENTATION OF ORDINARY
FRENCH LIFE
AND THE GREATER PART OF GREEK LITERATURE BEGINNING
WITH HOMER AND INCLUDING THE TRAGEDIANS PHILOSOPHERS AND WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE COMIC POETS WHOSE BUSINESS WAS TO RAISE A LAUGH
BY WHATEVER MEANS ALL THE GREATER WRITERS OF HELLAS WHO HAVE BEEN
PRESERVED TO US ARE FREE FROM THE TAINT OF INDECENCY
SOME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS OCCUR TO OUR MIND WHEN WE BEGIN TO REFLECT
ON THIS SUBJECT
1 THAT GOOD AND EVIL ARE LINKED TOGETHER IN HUMAN
NATURE AND HAVE OFTEN EXISTED SIDE BY SIDE IN THE WORLD AND IN MAN TO
AN EXTENT HARDLY CREDIBLE
WE CANNOT DISTINGUISH THEM AND ARE THEREFORE
UNABLE TO PART THEM AS IN THE PARABLE 'THEY GROW TOGETHER UNTO THE
HARVEST IT IS ONLY A RULE OF EXTERNAL DECENCY BY WHICH SOCIETY CAN
DIVIDE THEM
NOR SHOULD WE BE RIGHT IN INFERRING FROM THE PREVALENCE OF
ANY ONE VICE OR CORRUPTION THAT A STATE OR INDIVIDUAL WAS DEMORALIZED
IN THEIR WHOLE CHARACTER
NOT ONLY HAS THE CORRUPTION OF THE BEST BEEN
SOMETIMES THOUGHT TO BE THE WORST BUT IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THIS VERY
EXCESS OF EVIL HAS BEEN THE STIMULUS TO GOOD COMPARE PLATO LAWS WHERE
HE SAYS THAT IN THE MOST CORRUPT CITIES INDIVIDUALS ARE TO BE FOUND
BEYOND ALL PRAISE
2 IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT EVILS WHICH ADMIT OF
DEGREES CAN SELDOM BE RIGHTLY ESTIMATED BECAUSE UNDER THE SAME NAME
ACTIONS OF THE MOST DIFFERENT DEGREES OF CULPABILITY MAY BE INCLUDED
NO
CHARGE IS MORE EASILY SET GOING THAN THE IMPUTATION OF SECRET WICKEDNESS
WHICH CANNOT BE EITHER PROVED OR DISPROVED AND OFTEN CANNOT BE DEFINED
WHEN DIRECTED AGAINST A PERSON OF WHOM THE WORLD OR A SECTION OF IT IS
PREDISPOSED TO THINK EVIL
AND IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE MALIGNITY
OF GREEK SCANDAL AROUSED BY SOME PERSONAL JEALOUSY OR PARTY ENMITY MAY
HAVE CONVERTED THE INNOCENT FRIENDSHIP OF A GREAT MAN FOR A NOBLE YOUTH
INTO A CONNEXION OF ANOTHER KIND
SUCH ACCUSATIONS WERE BROUGHT AGAINST
SEVERAL OF THE LEADING MEN OF HELLAS E G
CIMON ALCIBIADES CRITIAS
DEMOSTHENES EPAMINONDAS SEVERAL OF THE ROMAN EMPERORS WERE ASSAILED
BY SIMILAR WEAPONS WHICH HAVE BEEN USED EVEN IN OUR OWN DAY AGAINST
STATESMEN OF THE HIGHEST CHARACTER
3 WHILE WE KNOW THAT IN THIS
MATTER THERE IS A GREAT GULF FIXED BETWEEN GREEK AND CHRISTIAN ETHICS
YET IF WE WOULD DO JUSTICE TO THE GREEKS WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THERE WAS A GREATER OUTSPOKENNESS AMONG THEM THAN AMONG OURSELVES ABOUT
THE THINGS WHICH NATURE HIDES AND THAT THE MORE FREQUENT MENTION OF
SUCH TOPICS IS NOT TO BE TAKEN AS THE MEASURE OF THE PREVALENCE OF
OFFENCES OR AS A PROOF OF THE GENERAL CORRUPTION OF SOCIETY
IT IS
LIKELY THAT EVERY RELIGION IN THE WORLD HAS USED WORDS OR PRACTISED
RITES IN ONE AGE WHICH HAVE BECOME DISTASTEFUL OR REPUGNANT TO ANOTHER
WE CANNOT THOUGH FOR DIFFERENT REASONS TRUST THE REPRESENTATIONS
EITHER OF COMEDY OR SATIRE AND STILL LESS OF CHRISTIAN APOLOGISTS
4 WE OBSERVE THAT AT THEBES AND LACEDEMON THE ATTACHMENT OF AN
ELDER FRIEND TO A BELOVED YOUTH WAS OFTEN DEEMED TO BE A PART OF HIS
EDUCATION AND WAS ENCOURAGED BY HIS PARENTS IT WAS ONLY SHAMEFUL IF
IT DEGENERATED INTO LICENTIOUSNESS
SUCH WE MAY BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN THE
TIE WHICH UNITED ASOPHYCHUS AND CEPHISODORUS WITH THE GREAT EPAMINONDAS
IN WHOSE COMPANIONSHIP THEY FELL PLUTARCH AMAT ATHENAEUS ON THE
AUTHORITY OF THEOPOMPUS
5 A SMALL MATTER THERE APPEARS TO BE A
DIFFERENCE OF CUSTOM AMONG THE GREEKS AND AMONG OURSELVES AS BETWEEN
OURSELVES AND CONTINENTAL NATIONS AT THE PRESENT TIME IN MODES OF
SALUTATION
WE MUST NOT SUSPECT EVIL IN THE HEARTY KISS OR EMBRACE OF
A MALE FRIEND 'RETURNING FROM THE ARMY AT POTIDAEA' ANY MORE THAN IN
A SIMILAR SALUTATION WHEN PRACTISED BY MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY
BUT
THOSE WHO MAKE THESE ADMISSIONS AND WHO REGARD NOT WITHOUT PITY THE
VICTIMS OF SUCH ILLUSIONS IN OUR OWN DAY WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN BLASTED
BY THEM MAY BE NONE THE LESS RESOLVED THAT THE NATURAL AND HEALTHY
INSTINCTS OF MANKIND SHALL ALONE BE TOLERATED GREEK AND THAT THE
LESSON OF MANLINESS WHICH WE HAVE INHERITED FROM OUR FATHERS SHALL NOT
DEGENERATE INTO SENTIMENTALISM OR EFFEMINACY
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN
HONOURABLE CONNEXION OF THIS KIND SEEMS TO HAVE DIED OUT WITH GREEK
CIVILIZATION
AMONG THE ROMANS AND ALSO AMONG BARBARIANS SUCH AS THE
CELTS AND PERSIANS THERE IS NO TRACE OF SUCH ATTACHMENTS EXISTING IN
ANY NOBLE OR VIRTUOUS FORM
COMPARE HOECK'S CRETA AND THE ADMIRABLE AND EXHAUSTIVE ARTICLE OF MEIER
IN ERSCH AND GRUEBER'S CYCLOPEDIA ON THIS SUBJECT PLUTARCH AMATORES
ATHENAEUS LYSIAS CONTRA SIMONEM AESCH
C
TIMARCHUM
THE CHARACTER OF ALCIBIADES IN THE SYMPOSIUM IS HARDLY LESS REMARKABLE
THAN THAT OF SOCRATES AND AGREES WITH THE PICTURE GIVEN OF HIM IN THE
FIRST OF THE TWO DIALOGUES WHICH ARE CALLED BY HIS NAME AND ALSO WITH
THE SLIGHT SKETCH OF HIM IN THE PROTAGORAS
HE IS THE IMPERSONATION OF
LAWLESSNESS 'THE LION'S WHELP WHO OUGHT NOT TO BE REARED IN THE
CITY YET NOT WITHOUT A CERTAIN GENEROSITY WHICH GAINED THE HEARTS OF
MEN STRANGELY FASCINATED BY SOCRATES AND POSSESSED OF A GENIUS WHICH
MIGHT HAVE BEEN EITHER THE DESTRUCTION OR SALVATION OF ATHENS
THE
DRAMATIC INTEREST OF THE CHARACTER IS HEIGHTENED BY THE RECOLLECTION OF
HIS AFTER HISTORY
HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PRESENT TO THE MIND OF PLATO
IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEMOCRATIC MAN OF THE REPUBLIC COMPARE ALSO
ALCIBIADES 1
THERE IS NO CRITERION OF THE DATE OF THE SYMPOSIUM EXCEPT THAT WHICH
IS FURNISHED BY THE ALLUSION TO THE DIVISION OF ARCADIA AFTER THE
DESTRUCTION OF MANTINEA
THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE YEAR B C
384 WHICH IS
THE FORTY FOURTH YEAR OF PLATO'S LIFE
THE SYMPOSIUM CANNOT THEREFORE BE
REGARDED AS A YOUTHFUL WORK
AS MANTINEA WAS RESTORED IN THE YEAR 369
THE COMPOSITION OF THE DIALOGUE WILL PROBABLY FALL BETWEEN 384 AND
369
WHETHER THE RECOLLECTION OF THE EVENT IS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN
RENEWED AT THE DESTRUCTION OR RESTORATION OF THE CITY RATHER THAN AT
SOME INTERMEDIATE PERIOD IS A CONSIDERATION NOT WORTH RAISING
THE SYMPOSIUM IS CONNECTED WITH THE PHAEDRUS BOTH IN STYLE AND SUBJECT
THEY ARE THE ONLY DIALOGUES OF PLATO IN WHICH THE THEME OF LOVE IS
DISCUSSED AT LENGTH
IN BOTH OF THEM PHILOSOPHY IS REGARDED AS A SORT OF
ENTHUSIASM OR MADNESS SOCRATES IS HIMSELF 'A PROPHET NEW INSPIRED' WITH
BACCHANALIAN REVELRY WHICH LIKE HIS PHILOSOPHY HE CHARACTERISTICALLY
PRETENDS TO HAVE DERIVED NOT FROM HIMSELF BUT FROM OTHERS
THE PHAEDO
ALSO PRESENTS SOME POINTS OF COMPARISON WITH THE SYMPOSIUM
FOR THERE
TOO PHILOSOPHY MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS 'DYING FOR LOVE AND THERE ARE
NOT WANTING MANY TOUCHES OF HUMOUR AND FANCY WHICH REMIND US OF THE
SYMPOSIUM
BUT WHILE THE PHAEDO AND PHAEDRUS LOOK BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
TO PAST AND FUTURE STATES OF EXISTENCE IN THE SYMPOSIUM THERE IS NO
BREAK BETWEEN THIS WORLD AND ANOTHER AND WE RISE FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
BY A REGULAR SERIES OF STEPS OR STAGES PROCEEDING FROM THE PARTICULARS
OF SENSE TO THE UNIVERSAL OF REASON AND FROM ONE UNIVERSAL TO MANY
WHICH ARE FINALLY REUNITED IN A SINGLE SCIENCE COMPARE REP
AT FIRST
IMMORTALITY MEANS ONLY THE SUCCESSION OF EXISTENCES EVEN KNOWLEDGE
COMES AND GOES
THEN FOLLOWS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MYSTERIES A HIGHER
AND A HIGHER DEGREE OF INITIATION AT LAST WE ARRIVE AT THE PERFECT
VISION OF BEAUTY NOT RELATIVE OR CHANGING BUT ETERNAL AND ABSOLUTE
NOT BOUNDED BY THIS WORLD OR IN OR OUT OF THIS WORLD BUT AN ASPECT OF
THE DIVINE EXTENDING OVER ALL THINGS AND HAVING NO LIMIT OF SPACE OR
TIME THIS IS THE HIGHEST KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH THE HUMAN MIND IS CAPABLE
PLATO DOES NOT GO ON TO ASK WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL IS ABSORBED IN THE
SEA OF LIGHT AND BEAUTY OR RETAINS HIS PERSONALITY
ENOUGH FOR HIM TO
HAVE ATTAINED THE TRUE BEAUTY OR GOOD WITHOUT ENQUIRING PRECISELY INTO
THE RELATION IN WHICH HUMAN BEINGS STOOD TO IT
THAT THE SOUL HAS SUCH
A REACH OF THOUGHT AND IS CAPABLE OF PARTAKING OF THE ETERNAL NATURE
SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT SHE TOO IS ETERNAL COMPARE PHAEDRUS
BUT PLATO
DOES NOT DISTINGUISH THE ETERNAL IN MAN FROM THE ETERNAL IN THE WORLD OR
IN GOD
HE IS WILLING TO REST IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE IDEA WHICH
TO HIM IS THE CAUSE OF ALL THINGS REP AND HAS NO STRENGTH TO GO
FURTHER
THE SYMPOSIUM OF XENOPHON IN WHICH SOCRATES DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS
A PANDER AND ALSO DISCOURSES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SENSUAL
AND SENTIMENTAL LOVE LIKEWISE OFFERS SEVERAL INTERESTING POINTS
OF COMPARISON
BUT THE SUSPICION WHICH HANGS OVER OTHER WRITINGS
OF XENOPHON AND THE NUMEROUS MINUTE REFERENCES TO THE PHAEDRUS AND
SYMPOSIUM AS WELL AS TO SOME OF THE OTHER WRITINGS OF PLATO THROW
A DOUBT ON THE GENUINENESS OF THE WORK
THE SYMPOSIUM OF XENOPHON IF
WRITTEN BY HIM AT ALL WOULD CERTAINLY SHOW THAT HE WROTE AGAINST PLATO
AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH HIS WORKS
OF THIS HOSTILITY THERE IS NO TRACE
IN THE MEMORABILIA
SUCH A RIVALRY IS MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF AN IMITATOR
THAN OF AN ORIGINAL WRITER
THE SO CALLED SYMPOSIUM OF XENOPHON
MAY THEREFORE HAVE NO MORE TITLE TO BE REGARDED AS GENUINE THAN THE
CONFESSEDLY SPURIOUS APOLOGY
THERE ARE NO MEANS OF DETERMINING THE RELATIVE ORDER IN TIME OF THE
PHAEDRUS SYMPOSIUM PHAEDO
THE ORDER WHICH HAS BEEN ADOPTED IN
THIS TRANSLATION RESTS ON NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THE DESIRE TO BRING
TOGETHER IN A SERIES THE MEMORIALS OF THE LIFE OF SOCRATES
SYMPOSIUM
PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE APOLLODORUS WHO REPEATS TO HIS COMPANION
THE DIALOGUE WHICH HE HAD HEARD FROM ARISTODEMUS AND HAD ALREADY ONCE
NARRATED TO GLAUCON
PHAEDRUS PAUSANIAS ERYXIMACHUS ARISTOPHANES
AGATHON SOCRATES ALCIBIADES A TROOP OF REVELLERS
SCENE THE HOUSE OF AGATHON
CONCERNING THE THINGS ABOUT WHICH YOU ASK TO BE INFORMED I BELIEVE THAT
I AM NOT ILL PREPARED WITH AN ANSWER
FOR THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I
WAS COMING FROM MY OWN HOME AT PHALERUM TO THE CITY AND ONE OF MY
ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD CAUGHT A SIGHT OF ME FROM BEHIND CALLING OUT
PLAYFULLY IN THE DISTANCE SAID APOLLODORUS O THOU PHALERIAN PROBABLY
A PLAY OF WORDS ON GREEK 'BALD HEADED MAN HALT SO I DID AS I
WAS BID AND THEN HE SAID I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU APOLLODORUS ONLY JUST
NOW THAT I MIGHT ASK YOU ABOUT THE SPEECHES IN PRAISE OF LOVE WHICH
WERE DELIVERED BY SOCRATES ALCIBIADES AND OTHERS AT AGATHON'S SUPPER
PHOENIX THE SON OF PHILIP TOLD ANOTHER PERSON WHO TOLD ME OF THEM
HIS NARRATIVE WAS VERY INDISTINCT BUT HE SAID THAT YOU KNEW AND I WISH
THAT YOU WOULD GIVE ME AN ACCOUNT OF THEM
WHO IF NOT YOU SHOULD BE
THE REPORTER OF THE WORDS OF YOUR FRIEND AND FIRST TELL ME HE SAID
WERE YOU PRESENT AT THIS MEETING
YOUR INFORMANT GLAUCON I SAID MUST HAVE BEEN VERY INDISTINCT INDEED
IF YOU IMAGINE THAT THE OCCASION WAS RECENT OR THAT I COULD HAVE BEEN
OF THE PARTY
WHY YES HE REPLIED I THOUGHT SO
IMPOSSIBLE I SAID
ARE YOU IGNORANT THAT FOR MANY YEARS AGATHON HAS NOT
RESIDED AT ATHENS AND NOT THREE HAVE ELAPSED SINCE I BECAME ACQUAINTED
WITH SOCRATES AND HAVE MADE IT MY DAILY BUSINESS TO KNOW ALL THAT HE
SAYS AND DOES
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I WAS RUNNING ABOUT THE WORLD
FANCYING MYSELF TO BE WELL EMPLOYED BUT I WAS REALLY A MOST WRETCHED
BEING NO BETTER THAN YOU ARE NOW
I THOUGHT THAT I OUGHT TO DO ANYTHING
RATHER THAN BE A PHILOSOPHER
WELL HE SAID JESTING APART TELL ME WHEN THE MEETING OCCURRED
IN OUR BOYHOOD I REPLIED WHEN AGATHON WON THE PRIZE WITH HIS FIRST
TRAGEDY ON THE DAY AFTER THAT ON WHICH HE AND HIS CHORUS OFFERED THE
SACRIFICE OF VICTORY
THEN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A LONG WHILE AGO HE SAID AND WHO TOLD YOU DID
SOCRATES
NO INDEED I REPLIED BUT THE SAME PERSON WHO TOLD PHOENIX HE WAS A
LITTLE FELLOW WHO NEVER WORE ANY SHOES ARISTODEMUS OF THE DEME OF
CYDATHENAEUM
HE HAD BEEN AT AGATHON'S FEAST AND I THINK THAT IN
THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NO ONE WHO WAS A MORE DEVOTED ADMIRER OF SOCRATES
MOREOVER I HAVE ASKED SOCRATES ABOUT THE TRUTH OF SOME PARTS OF HIS
NARRATIVE AND HE CONFIRMED THEM
THEN SAID GLAUCON LET US HAVE THE
TALE OVER AGAIN IS NOT THE ROAD TO ATHENS JUST MADE FOR CONVERSATION
AND SO WE WALKED AND TALKED OF THE DISCOURSES ON LOVE AND THEREFORE
AS I SAID AT FIRST I AM NOT ILL PREPARED TO COMPLY WITH YOUR REQUEST
AND WILL HAVE ANOTHER REHEARSAL OF THEM IF YOU LIKE
FOR TO SPEAK OR TO
HEAR OTHERS SPEAK OF PHILOSOPHY ALWAYS GIVES ME THE GREATEST PLEASURE
TO SAY NOTHING OF THE PROFIT
BUT WHEN I HEAR ANOTHER STRAIN ESPECIALLY
THAT OF YOU RICH MEN AND TRADERS SUCH CONVERSATION DISPLEASES ME AND
I PITY YOU WHO ARE MY COMPANIONS BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE DOING
SOMETHING WHEN IN REALITY YOU ARE DOING NOTHING
AND I DARE SAY THAT
YOU PITY ME IN RETURN WHOM YOU REGARD AS AN UNHAPPY CREATURE AND VERY
PROBABLY YOU ARE RIGHT
BUT I CERTAINLY KNOW OF YOU WHAT YOU ONLY THINK
OF ME THERE IS THE DIFFERENCE
COMPANION I SEE APOLLODORUS THAT YOU ARE JUST THE SAME ALWAYS
SPEAKING EVIL OF YOURSELF AND OF OTHERS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU PITY
ALL MANKIND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOCRATES YOURSELF FIRST OF ALL TRUE
IN THIS TO YOUR OLD NAME WHICH HOWEVER DESERVED I KNOW NOT HOW YOU
ACQUIRED OF APOLLODORUS THE MADMAN FOR YOU ARE ALWAYS RAGING AGAINST
YOURSELF AND EVERYBODY BUT SOCRATES
APOLLODORUS YES FRIEND AND THE REASON WHY I AM SAID TO BE MAD AND
OUT OF MY WITS IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE THESE NOTIONS OF MYSELF AND YOU
NO OTHER EVIDENCE IS REQUIRED
COMPANION NO MORE OF THAT APOLLODORUS BUT LET ME RENEW MY REQUEST
THAT YOU WOULD REPEAT THE CONVERSATION
APOLLODORUS WELL THE TALE OF LOVE WAS ON THIS WISE BUT PERHAPS I HAD
BETTER BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE YOU THE EXACT WORDS
OF ARISTODEMUS
HE SAID THAT HE MET SOCRATES FRESH FROM THE BATH AND SANDALLED AND AS
THE SIGHT OF THE SANDALS WAS UNUSUAL HE ASKED HIM WHITHER HE WAS GOING
THAT HE HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO SUCH A BEAU
TO A BANQUET AT AGATHON'S HE REPLIED WHOSE INVITATION TO HIS SACRIFICE
OF VICTORY I REFUSED YESTERDAY FEARING A CROWD BUT PROMISING THAT I
WOULD COME TO DAY INSTEAD AND SO I HAVE PUT ON MY FINERY BECAUSE HE IS
SUCH A FINE MAN
WHAT SAY YOU TO GOING WITH ME UNASKED
I WILL DO AS YOU BID ME I REPLIED
FOLLOW THEN HE SAID AND LET US DEMOLISH THE PROVERB
'TO THE FEASTS OF INFERIOR MEN THE GOOD UNBIDDEN GO
INSTEAD OF WHICH OUR PROVERB WILL RUN
'TO THE FEASTS OF THE GOOD THE GOOD UNBIDDEN GO
AND THIS ALTERATION MAY BE SUPPORTED BY THE AUTHORITY OF HOMER HIMSELF
WHO NOT ONLY DEMOLISHES BUT LITERALLY OUTRAGES THE PROVERB
FOR AFTER
PICTURING AGAMEMNON AS THE MOST VALIANT OF MEN HE MAKES MENELAUS WHO
IS BUT A FAINTHEARTED WARRIOR COME UNBIDDEN ILIAD TO THE BANQUET OF
AGAMEMNON WHO IS FEASTING AND OFFERING SACRIFICES NOT THE BETTER TO
THE WORSE BUT THE WORSE TO THE BETTER
I RATHER FEAR SOCRATES SAID ARISTODEMUS LEST THIS MAY STILL BE MY
CASE AND THAT LIKE MENELAUS IN HOMER I SHALL BE THE INFERIOR PERSON
WHO
'TO THE FEASTS OF THE WISE UNBIDDEN GOES
BUT I SHALL SAY THAT I WAS BIDDEN OF YOU AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE
AN EXCUSE
'TWO GOING TOGETHER
HE REPLIED IN HOMERIC FASHION ONE OR OTHER OF THEM MAY INVENT AN
EXCUSE BY THE WAY ILIAD
THIS WAS THE STYLE OF THEIR CONVERSATION AS THEY WENT ALONG
SOCRATES
DROPPED BEHIND IN A FIT OF ABSTRACTION AND DESIRED ARISTODEMUS WHO WAS
WAITING TO GO ON BEFORE HIM
WHEN HE REACHED THE HOUSE OF AGATHON
HE FOUND THE DOORS WIDE OPEN AND A COMICAL THING HAPPENED
A SERVANT
COMING OUT MET HIM AND LED HIM AT ONCE INTO THE BANQUETING HALL IN
WHICH THE GUESTS WERE RECLINING FOR THE BANQUET WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN
WELCOME ARISTODEMUS SAID AGATHON AS SOON AS HE APPEARED YOU ARE JUST
IN TIME TO SUP WITH US IF YOU COME ON ANY OTHER MATTER PUT IT OFF AND
MAKE ONE OF US AS I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU YESTERDAY AND MEANT TO HAVE
ASKED YOU IF I COULD HAVE FOUND YOU
BUT WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH
SOCRATES
I TURNED ROUND BUT SOCRATES WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN AND I HAD TO
EXPLAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN WITH ME A MOMENT BEFORE AND THAT I CAME BY HIS
INVITATION TO THE SUPPER
YOU WERE QUITE RIGHT IN COMING SAID AGATHON BUT WHERE IS HE HIMSELF
HE WAS BEHIND ME JUST NOW AS I ENTERED HE SAID AND I CANNOT THINK
WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM
GO AND LOOK FOR HIM BOY SAID AGATHON AND BRING HIM IN AND DO YOU
ARISTODEMUS MEANWHILE TAKE THE PLACE BY ERYXIMACHUS
THE SERVANT THEN ASSISTED HIM TO WASH AND HE LAY DOWN AND PRESENTLY
ANOTHER SERVANT CAME IN AND REPORTED THAT OUR FRIEND SOCRATES HAD
RETIRED INTO THE PORTICO OF THE NEIGHBOURING HOUSE
'THERE HE IS FIXED
SAID HE 'AND WHEN I CALL TO HIM HE WILL NOT STIR
HOW STRANGE SAID AGATHON THEN YOU MUST CALL HIM AGAIN AND KEEP
CALLING HIM
LET HIM ALONE SAID MY INFORMANT HE HAS A WAY OF STOPPING ANYWHERE AND
LOSING HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY REASON
I BELIEVE THAT HE WILL SOON APPEAR
DO NOT THEREFORE DISTURB HIM
WELL IF YOU THINK SO I WILL LEAVE HIM SAID AGATHON
AND THEN TURNING
TO THE SERVANTS HE ADDED 'LET US HAVE SUPPER WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM
SERVE UP WHATEVER YOU PLEASE FOR THERE IS NO ONE TO GIVE YOU ORDERS
HITHERTO I HAVE NEVER LEFT YOU TO YOURSELVES
BUT ON THIS OCCASION
IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE OUR HOSTS AND THAT I AND THE COMPANY ARE YOUR
GUESTS TREAT US WELL AND THEN WE SHALL COMMEND YOU AFTER THIS
SUPPER WAS SERVED BUT STILL NO SOCRATES AND DURING THE MEAL AGATHON
SEVERAL TIMES EXPRESSED A WISH TO SEND FOR HIM BUT ARISTODEMUS
OBJECTED AND AT LAST WHEN THE FEAST WAS ABOUT HALF OVER FOR THE FIT
AS USUAL WAS NOT OF LONG DURATION SOCRATES ENTERED
AGATHON WHO WAS
RECLINING ALONE AT THE END OF THE TABLE BEGGED THAT HE WOULD TAKE
THE PLACE NEXT TO HIM THAT 'I MAY TOUCH YOU HE SAID 'AND HAVE THE
BENEFIT OF THAT WISE THOUGHT WHICH CAME INTO YOUR MIND IN THE PORTICO
AND IS NOW IN YOUR POSSESSION FOR I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
COME AWAY UNTIL YOU HAD FOUND WHAT YOU SOUGHT
HOW I WISH SAID SOCRATES TAKING HIS PLACE AS HE WAS DESIRED THAT
WISDOM COULD BE INFUSED BY TOUCH OUT OF THE FULLER INTO THE EMPTIER
MAN AS WATER RUNS THROUGH WOOL OUT OF A FULLER CUP INTO AN EMPTIER ONE
IF THAT WERE SO HOW GREATLY SHOULD I VALUE THE PRIVILEGE OF RECLINING
AT YOUR SIDE FOR YOU WOULD HAVE FILLED ME FULL WITH A STREAM OF WISDOM
PLENTEOUS AND FAIR WHEREAS MY OWN IS OF A VERY MEAN AND QUESTIONABLE
SORT NO BETTER THAN A DREAM
BUT YOURS IS BRIGHT AND FULL OF PROMISE
AND WAS MANIFESTED FORTH IN ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF YOUTH THE DAY BEFORE
YESTERDAY IN THE PRESENCE OF MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND HELLENES
YOU ARE MOCKING SOCRATES SAID AGATHON AND ERE LONG YOU AND I WILL
HAVE TO DETERMINE WHO BEARS OFF THE PALM OF WISDOM OF THIS DIONYSUS
SHALL BE THE JUDGE BUT AT PRESENT YOU ARE BETTER OCCUPIED WITH SUPPER
SOCRATES TOOK HIS PLACE ON THE COUCH AND SUPPED WITH THE REST AND THEN
LIBATIONS WERE OFFERED AND AFTER A HYMN HAD BEEN SUNG TO THE GOD
AND THERE HAD BEEN THE USUAL CEREMONIES THEY WERE ABOUT TO COMMENCE
DRINKING WHEN PAUSANIAS SAID AND NOW MY FRIENDS HOW CAN WE DRINK
WITH LEAST INJURY TO OURSELVES I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT I FEEL SEVERELY
THE EFFECT OF YESTERDAY'S POTATIONS AND MUST HAVE TIME TO RECOVER AND
I SUSPECT THAT MOST OF YOU ARE IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT FOR YOU WERE
OF THE PARTY YESTERDAY
CONSIDER THEN HOW CAN THE DRINKING BE MADE
EASIEST
I ENTIRELY AGREE SAID ARISTOPHANES THAT WE SHOULD BY ALL MEANS AVOID
HARD DRINKING FOR I WAS MYSELF ONE OF THOSE WHO WERE YESTERDAY DROWNED
IN DRINK
I THINK THAT YOU ARE RIGHT SAID ERYXIMACHUS THE SON OF ACUMENUS BUT
I SHOULD STILL LIKE TO HEAR ONE OTHER PERSON SPEAK IS AGATHON ABLE TO
DRINK HARD
I AM NOT EQUAL TO IT SAID AGATHON
THEN SAID ERYXIMACHUS THE WEAK HEADS LIKE MYSELF ARISTODEMUS
PHAEDRUS AND OTHERS WHO NEVER CAN DRINK ARE FORTUNATE IN FINDING
THAT THE STRONGER ONES ARE NOT IN A DRINKING MOOD
I DO NOT INCLUDE
SOCRATES WHO IS ABLE EITHER TO DRINK OR TO ABSTAIN AND WILL NOT MIND
WHICHEVER WE DO WELL AS OF NONE OF THE COMPANY SEEM DISPOSED TO DRINK
MUCH I MAY BE FORGIVEN FOR SAYING AS A PHYSICIAN THAT DRINKING DEEP
IS A BAD PRACTICE WHICH I NEVER FOLLOW IF I CAN HELP AND CERTAINLY
DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANOTHER LEAST OF ALL TO ANY ONE WHO STILL FEELS THE
EFFECTS OF YESTERDAY'S CAROUSE
I ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU ADVISE AND ESPECIALLY WHAT YOU PRESCRIBE AS A
PHYSICIAN REJOINED PHAEDRUS THE MYRRHINUSIAN AND THE REST OF THE
COMPANY IF THEY ARE WISE WILL DO THE SAME
IT WAS AGREED THAT DRINKING WAS NOT TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY BUT THAT
THEY WERE ALL TO DRINK ONLY SO MUCH AS THEY PLEASED
THEN SAID ERYXIMACHUS AS YOU ARE ALL AGREED THAT DRINKING IS TO BE
VOLUNTARY AND THAT THERE IS TO BE NO COMPULSION I MOVE IN THE NEXT
PLACE THAT THE FLUTE GIRL WHO HAS JUST MADE HER APPEARANCE BE TOLD
TO GO AWAY AND PLAY TO HERSELF OR IF SHE LIKES TO THE WOMEN WHO ARE
WITHIN COMPARE PROT
TO DAY LET US HAVE CONVERSATION INSTEAD AND
IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME I WILL TELL YOU WHAT SORT OF CONVERSATION
THIS
PROPOSAL HAVING BEEN ACCEPTED ERYXIMACHUS PROCEEDED AS FOLLOWS
I WILL BEGIN HE SAID AFTER THE MANNER OF MELANIPPE IN EURIPIDES
'NOT MINE THE WORD'
WHICH I AM ABOUT TO SPEAK BUT THAT OF PHAEDRUS
FOR OFTEN HE SAYS TO ME
IN AN INDIGNANT TONE 'WHAT A STRANGE THING IT IS ERYXIMACHUS THAT
WHEREAS OTHER GODS HAVE POEMS AND HYMNS MADE IN THEIR HONOUR THE GREAT
AND GLORIOUS GOD LOVE HAS NO ENCOMIAST AMONG ALL THE POETS WHO ARE
SO MANY
THERE ARE THE WORTHY SOPHISTS TOO THE EXCELLENT PRODICUS FOR
EXAMPLE WHO HAVE DESCANTED IN PROSE ON THE VIRTUES OF HERACLES AND
OTHER HEROES AND WHAT IS STILL MORE EXTRAORDINARY I HAVE MET WITH A
PHILOSOPHICAL WORK IN WHICH THE UTILITY OF SALT HAS BEEN MADE THE THEME
OF AN ELOQUENT DISCOURSE AND MANY OTHER LIKE THINGS HAVE HAD A LIKE
HONOUR BESTOWED UPON THEM
AND ONLY TO THINK THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
AN EAGER INTEREST CREATED ABOUT THEM AND YET THAT TO THIS DAY NO ONE
HAS EVER DARED WORTHILY TO HYMN LOVE'S PRAISES SO ENTIRELY HAS THIS
GREAT DEITY BEEN NEGLECTED NOW IN THIS PHAEDRUS SEEMS TO ME TO BE
QUITE RIGHT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO OFFER HIM A CONTRIBUTION ALSO I
THINK THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WE WHO ARE HERE ASSEMBLED CANNOT DO
BETTER THAN HONOUR THE GOD LOVE
IF YOU AGREE WITH ME THERE WILL BE
NO LACK OF CONVERSATION FOR I MEAN TO PROPOSE THAT EACH OF US IN TURN
GOING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT SHALL MAKE A SPEECH IN HONOUR OF LOVE
LET HIM
GIVE US THE BEST WHICH HE CAN AND PHAEDRUS BECAUSE HE IS SITTING FIRST
ON THE LEFT HAND AND BECAUSE HE IS THE FATHER OF THE THOUGHT SHALL
BEGIN
NO ONE WILL VOTE AGAINST YOU ERYXIMACHUS SAID SOCRATES
HOW CAN I
OPPOSE YOUR MOTION WHO PROFESS TO UNDERSTAND NOTHING BUT MATTERS OF
LOVE NOR I PRESUME WILL AGATHON AND PAUSANIAS AND THERE CAN BE
NO DOUBT OF ARISTOPHANES WHOSE WHOLE CONCERN IS WITH DIONYSUS AND
APHRODITE NOR WILL ANY ONE DISAGREE OF THOSE WHOM I SEE AROUND ME
THE
PROPOSAL AS I AM AWARE MAY SEEM RATHER HARD UPON US WHOSE PLACE IS
LAST BUT WE SHALL BE CONTENTED IF WE HEAR SOME GOOD SPEECHES FIRST
LET
PHAEDRUS BEGIN THE PRAISE OF LOVE AND GOOD LUCK TO HIM
ALL THE COMPANY
EXPRESSED THEIR ASSENT AND DESIRED HIM TO DO AS SOCRATES BADE HIM
ARISTODEMUS DID NOT RECOLLECT ALL THAT WAS SAID NOR DO I RECOLLECT ALL
THAT HE RELATED TO ME BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I THOUGHT MOST WORTHY OF
REMEMBRANCE AND WHAT THE CHIEF SPEAKERS SAID
PHAEDRUS BEGAN BY AFFIRMING THAT LOVE IS A MIGHTY GOD AND WONDERFUL
AMONG GODS AND MEN BUT ESPECIALLY WONDERFUL IN HIS BIRTH
FOR HE IS THE
ELDEST OF THE GODS WHICH IS AN HONOUR TO HIM AND A PROOF OF HIS CLAIM
TO THIS HONOUR IS THAT OF HIS PARENTS THERE IS NO MEMORIAL NEITHER
POET NOR PROSE WRITER HAS EVER AFFIRMED THAT HE HAD ANY
AS HESIOD
SAYS
'FIRST CHAOS CAME AND THEN BROAD BOSOMED EARTH THE EVERLASTING SEAT OF
ALL THAT IS AND LOVE
IN OTHER WORDS AFTER CHAOS THE EARTH AND LOVE THESE TWO CAME INTO
BEING
ALSO PARMENIDES SINGS OF GENERATION
'FIRST IN THE TRAIN OF GODS HE FASHIONED LOVE
AND ACUSILAUS AGREES WITH HESIOD
THUS NUMEROUS ARE THE WITNESSES WHO
ACKNOWLEDGE LOVE TO BE THE ELDEST OF THE GODS
AND NOT ONLY IS HE THE
ELDEST HE IS ALSO THE SOURCE OF THE GREATEST BENEFITS TO US
FOR I KNOW
NOT ANY GREATER BLESSING TO A YOUNG MAN WHO IS BEGINNING LIFE THAN A
VIRTUOUS LOVER OR TO THE LOVER THAN A BELOVED YOUTH
FOR THE PRINCIPLE
WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE GUIDE OF MEN WHO WOULD NOBLY LIVE THAT PRINCIPLE
I SAY NEITHER KINDRED NOR HONOUR NOR WEALTH NOR ANY OTHER MOTIVE IS
ABLE TO IMPLANT SO WELL AS LOVE
OF WHAT AM I SPEAKING OF THE SENSE OF
HONOUR AND DISHONOUR WITHOUT WHICH NEITHER STATES NOR INDIVIDUALS EVER
DO ANY GOOD OR GREAT WORK
AND I SAY THAT A LOVER WHO IS DETECTED IN
DOING ANY DISHONOURABLE ACT OR SUBMITTING THROUGH COWARDICE WHEN
ANY DISHONOUR IS DONE TO HIM BY ANOTHER WILL BE MORE PAINED AT BEING
DETECTED BY HIS BELOVED THAN AT BEING SEEN BY HIS FATHER OR BY HIS
COMPANIONS OR BY ANY ONE ELSE
THE BELOVED TOO WHEN HE IS FOUND IN
ANY DISGRACEFUL SITUATION HAS THE SAME FEELING ABOUT HIS LOVER
AND IF
THERE WERE ONLY SOME WAY OF CONTRIVING THAT A STATE OR AN ARMY SHOULD BE
MADE UP OF LOVERS AND THEIR LOVES COMPARE REP THEY WOULD BE THE VERY
BEST GOVERNORS OF THEIR OWN CITY ABSTAINING FROM ALL DISHONOUR AND
EMULATING ONE ANOTHER IN HONOUR AND WHEN FIGHTING AT EACH OTHER'S SIDE
ALTHOUGH A MERE HANDFUL THEY WOULD OVERCOME THE WORLD
FOR WHAT LOVER
WOULD NOT CHOOSE RATHER TO BE SEEN BY ALL MANKIND THAN BY HIS BELOVED
EITHER WHEN ABANDONING HIS POST OR THROWING AWAY HIS ARMS HE WOULD BE
READY TO DIE A THOUSAND DEATHS RATHER THAN ENDURE THIS
OR WHO WOULD
DESERT HIS BELOVED OR FAIL HIM IN THE HOUR OF DANGER THE VERIEST COWARD
WOULD BECOME AN INSPIRED HERO EQUAL TO THE BRAVEST AT SUCH A TIME
LOVE WOULD INSPIRE HIM
THAT COURAGE WHICH AS HOMER SAYS THE GOD
BREATHES INTO THE SOULS OF SOME HEROES LOVE OF HIS OWN NATURE INFUSES
INTO THE LOVER
LOVE WILL MAKE MEN DARE TO DIE FOR THEIR BELOVED LOVE ALONE AND WOMEN
AS WELL AS MEN
OF THIS ALCESTIS THE DAUGHTER OF PELIAS IS A MONUMENT
TO ALL HELLAS FOR SHE WAS WILLING TO LAY DOWN HER LIFE ON BEHALF OF HER
HUSBAND WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD ALTHOUGH HE HAD A FATHER AND MOTHER
BUT THE TENDERNESS OF HER LOVE SO FAR EXCEEDED THEIRS THAT SHE MADE
THEM SEEM TO BE STRANGERS IN BLOOD TO THEIR OWN SON AND IN NAME ONLY
RELATED TO HIM AND SO NOBLE DID THIS ACTION OF HERS APPEAR TO THE GODS
AS WELL AS TO MEN THAT AMONG THE MANY WHO HAVE DONE VIRTUOUSLY SHE IS
ONE OF THE VERY FEW TO WHOM IN ADMIRATION OF HER NOBLE ACTION THEY
HAVE GRANTED THE PRIVILEGE OF RETURNING ALIVE TO EARTH SUCH EXCEEDING
HONOUR IS PAID BY THE GODS TO THE DEVOTION AND VIRTUE OF LOVE
BUT
ORPHEUS THE SON OF OEAGRUS THE HARPER THEY SENT EMPTY AWAY AND
PRESENTED TO HIM AN APPARITION ONLY OF HER WHOM HE SOUGHT BUT HERSELF
THEY WOULD NOT GIVE UP BECAUSE HE SHOWED NO SPIRIT HE WAS ONLY A
HARP PLAYER AND DID NOT DARE LIKE ALCESTIS TO DIE FOR LOVE BUT WAS
CONTRIVING HOW HE MIGHT ENTER HADES ALIVE MOREOVER THEY AFTERWARDS
CAUSED HIM TO SUFFER DEATH AT THE HANDS OF WOMEN AS THE PUNISHMENT
OF HIS COWARDLINESS
VERY DIFFERENT WAS THE REWARD OF THE TRUE LOVE OF
ACHILLES TOWARDS HIS LOVER PATROCLUS HIS LOVER AND NOT HIS LOVE THE
NOTION THAT PATROCLUS WAS THE BELOVED ONE IS A FOOLISH ERROR INTO WHICH
AESCHYLUS HAS FALLEN FOR ACHILLES WAS SURELY THE FAIRER OF THE TWO
FAIRER ALSO THAN ALL THE OTHER HEROES AND AS HOMER INFORMS US HE WAS
STILL BEARDLESS AND YOUNGER FAR
AND GREATLY AS THE GODS HONOUR THE
VIRTUE OF LOVE STILL THE RETURN OF LOVE ON THE PART OF THE BELOVED TO
THE LOVER IS MORE ADMIRED AND VALUED AND REWARDED BY THEM FOR THE LOVER
IS MORE DIVINE BECAUSE HE IS INSPIRED BY GOD
NOW ACHILLES WAS QUITE
AWARE FOR HE HAD BEEN TOLD BY HIS MOTHER THAT HE MIGHT AVOID DEATH AND
RETURN HOME AND LIVE TO A GOOD OLD AGE IF HE ABSTAINED FROM SLAYING
HECTOR
NEVERTHELESS HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO REVENGE HIS FRIEND AND DARED
TO DIE NOT ONLY IN HIS DEFENCE BUT AFTER HE WAS DEAD
WHEREFORE THE
GODS HONOURED HIM EVEN ABOVE ALCESTIS AND SENT HIM TO THE ISLANDS OF
THE BLEST
THESE ARE MY REASONS FOR AFFIRMING THAT LOVE IS THE ELDEST
AND NOBLEST AND MIGHTIEST OF THE GODS AND THE CHIEFEST AUTHOR AND GIVER
OF VIRTUE IN LIFE AND OF HAPPINESS AFTER DEATH
THIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS THE SPEECH OF PHAEDRUS AND SOME OTHER
SPEECHES FOLLOWED WHICH ARISTODEMUS DID NOT REMEMBER THE NEXT WHICH HE
REPEATED WAS THAT OF PAUSANIAS
PHAEDRUS HE SAID THE ARGUMENT HAS NOT
BEEN SET BEFORE US I THINK QUITE IN THE RIGHT FORM WE SHOULD NOT BE
CALLED UPON TO PRAISE LOVE IN SUCH AN INDISCRIMINATE MANNER
IF THERE
WERE ONLY ONE LOVE THEN WHAT YOU SAID WOULD BE WELL ENOUGH BUT SINCE
THERE ARE MORE LOVES THAN ONE SHOULD HAVE BEGUN BY DETERMINING WHICH
OF THEM WAS TO BE THE THEME OF OUR PRAISES
I WILL AMEND THIS DEFECT
AND FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHICH LOVE IS DESERVING OF PRAISE AND
THEN TRY TO HYMN THE PRAISEWORTHY ONE IN A MANNER WORTHY OF HIM
FOR WE
ALL KNOW THAT LOVE IS INSEPARABLE FROM APHRODITE AND IF THERE WERE
ONLY ONE APHRODITE THERE WOULD BE ONLY ONE LOVE BUT AS THERE ARE TWO
GODDESSES THERE MUST BE TWO LOVES
AND AM I NOT RIGHT IN ASSERTING THAT
THERE ARE TWO GODDESSES THE ELDER ONE HAVING NO MOTHER WHO IS CALLED
THE HEAVENLY APHRODITE SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF URANUS THE YOUNGER WHO
IS THE DAUGHTER OF ZEUS AND DIONE HER WE CALL COMMON AND THE LOVE
WHO IS HER FELLOW WORKER IS RIGHTLY NAMED COMMON AS THE OTHER LOVE IS
CALLED HEAVENLY
ALL THE GODS OUGHT TO HAVE PRAISE GIVEN TO THEM BUT
NOT WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF THEIR NATURES AND THEREFORE I MUST TRY TO
DISTINGUISH THE CHARACTERS OF THE TWO LOVES
NOW ACTIONS VARY ACCORDING
TO THE MANNER OF THEIR PERFORMANCE
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHICH WE
ARE NOW DOING DRINKING SINGING AND TALKING THESE ACTIONS ARE NOT IN
THEMSELVES EITHER GOOD OR EVIL BUT THEY TURN OUT IN THIS OR THAT WAY
ACCORDING TO THE MODE OF PERFORMING THEM AND WHEN WELL DONE THEY ARE
GOOD AND WHEN WRONGLY DONE THEY ARE EVIL AND IN LIKE MANNER NOT EVERY
LOVE BUT ONLY THAT WHICH HAS A NOBLE PURPOSE IS NOBLE AND WORTHY
OF PRAISE
THE LOVE WHO IS THE OFFSPRING OF THE COMMON APHRODITE IS
ESSENTIALLY COMMON AND HAS NO DISCRIMINATION BEING SUCH AS THE MEANER
SORT OF MEN FEEL AND IS APT TO BE OF WOMEN AS WELL AS OF YOUTHS AND
IS OF THE BODY RATHER THAN OF THE SOUL THE MOST FOOLISH BEINGS ARE THE
OBJECTS OF THIS LOVE WHICH DESIRES ONLY TO GAIN AN END BUT NEVER THINKS
OF ACCOMPLISHING THE END NOBLY AND THEREFORE DOES GOOD AND EVIL QUITE
INDISCRIMINATELY
THE GODDESS WHO IS HIS MOTHER IS FAR YOUNGER THAN
THE OTHER AND SHE WAS BORN OF THE UNION OF THE MALE AND FEMALE AND
PARTAKES OF BOTH
BUT THE OFFSPRING OF THE HEAVENLY APHRODITE IS DERIVED
FROM A MOTHER IN WHOSE BIRTH THE FEMALE HAS NO PART SHE IS FROM THE
MALE ONLY THIS IS THAT LOVE WHICH IS OF YOUTHS AND THE GODDESS BEING
OLDER THERE IS NOTHING OF WANTONNESS IN HER
THOSE WHO ARE INSPIRED BY
THIS LOVE TURN TO THE MALE AND DELIGHT IN HIM WHO IS THE MORE VALIANT
AND INTELLIGENT NATURE ANY ONE MAY RECOGNISE THE PURE ENTHUSIASTS IN
THE VERY CHARACTER OF THEIR ATTACHMENTS
FOR THEY LOVE NOT BOYS BUT
INTELLIGENT BEINGS WHOSE REASON IS BEGINNING TO BE DEVELOPED MUCH ABOUT
THE TIME AT WHICH THEIR BEARDS BEGIN TO GROW
AND IN CHOOSING YOUNG MEN
TO BE THEIR COMPANIONS THEY MEAN TO BE FAITHFUL TO THEM AND PASS THEIR
WHOLE LIFE IN COMPANY WITH THEM NOT TO TAKE THEM IN THEIR INEXPERIENCE
AND DECEIVE THEM AND PLAY THE FOOL WITH THEM OR RUN AWAY FROM ONE TO
ANOTHER OF THEM
BUT THE LOVE OF YOUNG BOYS SHOULD BE FORBIDDEN BY LAW
BECAUSE THEIR FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN THEY MAY TURN OUT GOOD OR BAD EITHER
IN BODY OR SOUL AND MUCH NOBLE ENTHUSIASM MAY BE THROWN AWAY UPON THEM
IN THIS MATTER THE GOOD ARE A LAW TO THEMSELVES AND THE COARSER SORT
OF LOVERS OUGHT TO BE RESTRAINED BY FORCE AS WE RESTRAIN OR ATTEMPT TO
RESTRAIN THEM FROM FIXING THEIR AFFECTIONS ON WOMEN OF FREE BIRTH
THESE
ARE THE PERSONS WHO BRING A REPROACH ON LOVE AND SOME HAVE BEEN LED TO
DENY THE LAWFULNESS OF SUCH ATTACHMENTS BECAUSE THEY SEE THE IMPROPRIETY
AND EVIL OF THEM FOR SURELY NOTHING THAT IS DECOROUSLY AND LAWFULLY
DONE CAN JUSTLY BE CENSURED
NOW HERE AND IN LACEDAEMON THE RULES ABOUT
LOVE ARE PERPLEXING BUT IN MOST CITIES THEY ARE SIMPLE AND EASILY
INTELLIGIBLE IN ELIS AND BOEOTIA AND IN COUNTRIES HAVING NO GIFTS OF
ELOQUENCE THEY ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD THE LAW IS SIMPLY IN FAVOUR OF
THESE CONNEXIONS AND NO ONE WHETHER YOUNG OR OLD HAS ANYTHING TO SAY
TO THEIR DISCREDIT THE REASON BEING AS I SUPPOSE THAT THEY ARE MEN
OF FEW WORDS IN THOSE PARTS AND THEREFORE THE LOVERS DO NOT LIKE THE
TROUBLE OF PLEADING THEIR SUIT
IN IONIA AND OTHER PLACES AND GENERALLY
IN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE BARBARIANS THE CUSTOM IS HELD
TO BE DISHONOURABLE LOVES OF YOUTHS SHARE THE EVIL REPUTE IN WHICH
PHILOSOPHY AND GYMNASTICS ARE HELD BECAUSE THEY ARE INIMICAL TO
TYRANNY FOR THE INTERESTS OF RULERS REQUIRE THAT THEIR SUBJECTS SHOULD
BE POOR IN SPIRIT COMPARE ARIST
POLITICS AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO
STRONG BOND OF FRIENDSHIP OR SOCIETY AMONG THEM WHICH LOVE ABOVE ALL
OTHER MOTIVES IS LIKELY TO INSPIRE AS OUR ATHENIAN TYRANTS LEARNED BY
EXPERIENCE FOR THE LOVE OF ARISTOGEITON AND THE CONSTANCY OF HARMODIUS
HAD A STRENGTH WHICH UNDID THEIR POWER
AND THEREFORE THE ILL REPUTE
INTO WHICH THESE ATTACHMENTS HAVE FALLEN IS TO BE ASCRIBED TO THE EVIL
CONDITION OF THOSE WHO MAKE THEM TO BE ILL REPUTED THAT IS TO SAY TO
THE SELF SEEKING OF THE GOVERNORS AND THE COWARDICE OF THE GOVERNED ON
THE OTHER HAND THE INDISCRIMINATE HONOUR WHICH IS GIVEN TO THEM IN SOME
COUNTRIES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LAZINESS OF THOSE WHO HOLD THIS OPINION
OF THEM
IN OUR OWN COUNTRY A FAR BETTER PRINCIPLE PREVAILS BUT AS
I WAS SAYING THE EXPLANATION OF IT IS RATHER PERPLEXING
FOR OBSERVE
THAT OPEN LOVES ARE HELD TO BE MORE HONOURABLE THAN SECRET ONES AND
THAT THE LOVE OF THE NOBLEST AND HIGHEST EVEN IF THEIR PERSONS ARE
LESS BEAUTIFUL THAN OTHERS IS ESPECIALLY HONOURABLE
CONSIDER TOO
HOW GREAT IS THE ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH ALL THE WORLD GIVES TO THE LOVER
NEITHER IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING ANYTHING DISHONOURABLE BUT IF HE
SUCCEEDS HE IS PRAISED AND IF HE FAIL HE IS BLAMED
AND IN THE PURSUIT
OF HIS LOVE THE CUSTOM OF MANKIND ALLOWS HIM TO DO MANY STRANGE THINGS
WHICH PHILOSOPHY WOULD BITTERLY CENSURE IF THEY WERE DONE FROM ANY
MOTIVE OF INTEREST OR WISH FOR OFFICE OR POWER
HE MAY PRAY AND
ENTREAT AND SUPPLICATE AND SWEAR AND LIE ON A MAT AT THE DOOR AND
ENDURE A SLAVERY WORSE THAN THAT OF ANY SLAVE IN ANY OTHER CASE FRIENDS
AND ENEMIES WOULD BE EQUALLY READY TO PREVENT HIM BUT NOW THERE IS NO
FRIEND WHO WILL BE ASHAMED OF HIM AND ADMONISH HIM AND NO ENEMY WILL
CHARGE HIM WITH MEANNESS OR FLATTERY THE ACTIONS OF A LOVER HAVE A
GRACE WHICH ENNOBLES THEM AND CUSTOM HAS DECIDED THAT THEY ARE HIGHLY
COMMENDABLE AND THAT THERE NO LOSS OF CHARACTER IN THEM AND WHAT IS
STRANGEST OF ALL HE ONLY MAY SWEAR AND FORSWEAR HIMSELF SO MEN SAY
AND THE GODS WILL FORGIVE HIS TRANSGRESSION FOR THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS A LOVER'S OATH
SUCH IS THE ENTIRE LIBERTY WHICH GODS AND MEN HAVE
ALLOWED THE LOVER ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM WHICH PREVAILS IN OUR PART OF
THE WORLD
FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW A MAN FAIRLY ARGUES THAT IN ATHENS
TO LOVE AND TO BE LOVED IS HELD TO BE A VERY HONOURABLE THING
BUT WHEN
PARENTS FORBID THEIR SONS TO TALK WITH THEIR LOVERS AND PLACE THEM
UNDER A TUTOR'S CARE WHO IS APPOINTED TO SEE TO THESE THINGS AND THEIR
COMPANIONS AND EQUALS CAST IN THEIR TEETH ANYTHING OF THE SORT WHICH
THEY MAY OBSERVE AND THEIR ELDERS REFUSE TO SILENCE THE REPROVERS
AND DO NOT REBUKE THEM ANY ONE WHO REFLECTS ON ALL THIS WILL ON THE
CONTRARY THINK THAT WE HOLD THESE PRACTICES TO BE MOST DISGRACEFUL
BUT AS I WAS SAYING AT FIRST THE TRUTH AS I IMAGINE IS THAT WHETHER
SUCH PRACTICES ARE HONOURABLE OR WHETHER THEY ARE DISHONOURABLE IS NOT A
SIMPLE QUESTION THEY ARE HONOURABLE TO HIM WHO FOLLOWS THEM HONOURABLY
DISHONOURABLE TO HIM WHO FOLLOWS THEM DISHONOURABLY
THERE IS DISHONOUR
IN YIELDING TO THE EVIL OR IN AN EVIL MANNER BUT THERE IS HONOUR IN
YIELDING TO THE GOOD OR IN AN HONOURABLE MANNER
EVIL IS THE VULGAR
LOVER WHO LOVES THE BODY RATHER THAN THE SOUL INASMUCH AS HE IS NOT
EVEN STABLE BECAUSE HE LOVES A THING WHICH IS IN ITSELF UNSTABLE AND
THEREFORE WHEN THE BLOOM OF YOUTH WHICH HE WAS DESIRING IS OVER HE
TAKES WING AND FLIES AWAY IN SPITE OF ALL HIS WORDS AND PROMISES
WHEREAS THE LOVE OF THE NOBLE DISPOSITION IS LIFE LONG FOR IT BECOMES
ONE WITH THE EVERLASTING
THE CUSTOM OF OUR COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BOTH OF
THEM PROVEN WELL AND TRULY AND WOULD HAVE US YIELD TO THE ONE SORT OF
LOVER AND AVOID THE OTHER AND THEREFORE ENCOURAGES SOME TO PURSUE
AND OTHERS TO FLY TESTING BOTH THE LOVER AND BELOVED IN CONTESTS AND
TRIALS UNTIL THEY SHOW TO WHICH OF THE TWO CLASSES THEY RESPECTIVELY
BELONG
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY IN THE FIRST PLACE A HASTY
ATTACHMENT IS HELD TO BE DISHONOURABLE BECAUSE TIME IS THE TRUE TEST OF
THIS AS OF MOST OTHER THINGS AND SECONDLY THERE IS A DISHONOUR IN BEING
OVERCOME BY THE LOVE OF MONEY OR OF WEALTH OR OF POLITICAL POWER
WHETHER A MAN IS FRIGHTENED INTO SURRENDER BY THE LOSS OF THEM OR
HAVING EXPERIENCED THE BENEFITS OF MONEY AND POLITICAL CORRUPTION IS
UNABLE TO RISE ABOVE THE SEDUCTIONS OF THEM
FOR NONE OF THESE THINGS
ARE OF A PERMANENT OR LASTING NATURE NOT TO MENTION THAT NO GENEROUS
FRIENDSHIP EVER SPRANG FROM THEM
THERE REMAINS THEN ONLY ONE WAY OF
HONOURABLE ATTACHMENT WHICH CUSTOM ALLOWS IN THE BELOVED AND THIS IS
THE WAY OF VIRTUE FOR AS WE ADMITTED THAT ANY SERVICE WHICH THE LOVER
DOES TO HIM IS NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FLATTERY OR A DISHONOUR TO HIMSELF
SO THE BELOVED HAS ONE WAY ONLY OF VOLUNTARY SERVICE WHICH IS NOT
DISHONOURABLE AND THIS IS VIRTUOUS SERVICE
FOR WE HAVE A CUSTOM AND ACCORDING TO OUR CUSTOM ANY ONE WHO DOES
SERVICE TO ANOTHER UNDER THE IDEA THAT HE WILL BE IMPROVED BY HIM EITHER
IN WISDOM OR IN SOME OTHER PARTICULAR OF VIRTUE SUCH A VOLUNTARY
SERVICE I SAY IS NOT TO BE REGARDED AS A DISHONOUR AND IS NOT OPEN
TO THE CHARGE OF FLATTERY
AND THESE TWO CUSTOMS ONE THE LOVE OF YOUTH
AND THE OTHER THE PRACTICE OF PHILOSOPHY AND VIRTUE IN GENERAL OUGHT TO
MEET IN ONE AND THEN THE BELOVED MAY HONOURABLY INDULGE THE LOVER
FOR
WHEN THE LOVER AND BELOVED COME TOGETHER HAVING EACH OF THEM A LAW AND
THE LOVER THINKS THAT HE IS RIGHT IN DOING ANY SERVICE WHICH HE CAN TO
HIS GRACIOUS LOVING ONE AND THE OTHER THAT HE IS RIGHT IN SHOWING ANY
KINDNESS WHICH HE CAN TO HIM WHO IS MAKING HIM WISE AND GOOD THE ONE
CAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING WISDOM AND VIRTUE THE OTHER SEEKING TO ACQUIRE
THEM WITH A VIEW TO EDUCATION AND WISDOM WHEN THE TWO LAWS OF LOVE ARE
FULFILLED AND MEET IN ONE THEN AND THEN ONLY MAY THE BELOVED YIELD
WITH HONOUR TO THE LOVER
NOR WHEN LOVE IS OF THIS DISINTERESTED SORT IS
THERE ANY DISGRACE IN BEING DECEIVED BUT IN EVERY OTHER CASE THERE IS
EQUAL DISGRACE IN BEING OR NOT BEING DECEIVED
FOR HE WHO IS GRACIOUS TO
HIS LOVER UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE IS RICH AND IS DISAPPOINTED OF
HIS GAINS BECAUSE HE TURNS OUT TO BE POOR IS DISGRACED ALL THE SAME
FOR HE HAS DONE HIS BEST TO SHOW THAT HE WOULD GIVE HIMSELF UP TO ANY
ONE'S 'USES BASE' FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY BUT THIS IS NOT HONOURABLE
AND
ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE HE WHO GIVES HIMSELF TO A LOVER BECAUSE HE IS A
GOOD MAN AND IN THE HOPE THAT HE WILL BE IMPROVED BY HIS COMPANY SHOWS
HIMSELF TO BE VIRTUOUS EVEN THOUGH THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION TURN
OUT TO BE A VILLAIN AND TO HAVE NO VIRTUE AND IF HE IS DECEIVED HE HAS
COMMITTED A NOBLE ERROR
FOR HE HAS PROVED THAT FOR HIS PART HE WILL DO
ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY WITH A VIEW TO VIRTUE AND IMPROVEMENT THAN WHICH
THERE CAN BE NOTHING NOBLER
THUS NOBLE IN EVERY CASE IS THE ACCEPTANCE
OF ANOTHER FOR THE SAKE OF VIRTUE
THIS IS THAT LOVE WHICH IS THE
LOVE OF THE HEAVENLY GODESS AND IS HEAVENLY AND OF GREAT PRICE TO
INDIVIDUALS AND CITIES MAKING THE LOVER AND THE BELOVED ALIKE EAGER IN
THE WORK OF THEIR OWN IMPROVEMENT
BUT ALL OTHER LOVES ARE THE OFFSPRING
OF THE OTHER WHO IS THE COMMON GODDESS
TO YOU PHAEDRUS I OFFER THIS
MY CONTRIBUTION IN PRAISE OF LOVE WHICH IS AS GOOD AS I COULD MAKE
EXTEMPORE
PAUSANIAS CAME TO A PAUSE THIS IS THE BALANCED WAY IN WHICH I HAVE
BEEN TAUGHT BY THE WISE TO SPEAK AND ARISTODEMUS SAID THAT THE TURN OF
ARISTOPHANES WAS NEXT BUT EITHER HE HAD EATEN TOO MUCH OR FROM SOME
OTHER CAUSE HE HAD THE HICCOUGH AND WAS OBLIGED TO CHANGE TURNS WITH
ERYXIMACHUS THE PHYSICIAN WHO WAS RECLINING ON THE COUCH BELOW HIM
ERYXIMACHUS HE SAID YOU OUGHT EITHER TO STOP MY HICCOUGH OR TO SPEAK
IN MY TURN UNTIL I HAVE LEFT OFF
I WILL DO BOTH SAID ERYXIMACHUS I WILL SPEAK IN YOUR TURN AND DO YOU
SPEAK IN MINE AND WHILE I AM SPEAKING LET ME RECOMMEND YOU TO HOLD YOUR
BREATH AND IF AFTER YOU HAVE DONE SO FOR SOME TIME THE HICCOUGH IS
NO BETTER THEN GARGLE WITH A LITTLE WATER AND IF IT STILL CONTINUES
TICKLE YOUR NOSE WITH SOMETHING AND SNEEZE AND IF YOU SNEEZE ONCE OR
TWICE EVEN THE MOST VIOLENT HICCOUGH IS SURE TO GO
I WILL DO AS YOU
PRESCRIBE SAID ARISTOPHANES AND NOW GET ON
ERYXIMACHUS SPOKE AS FOLLOWS SEEING THAT PAUSANIAS MADE A FAIR
BEGINNING AND BUT A LAME ENDING I MUST ENDEAVOUR TO SUPPLY HIS
DEFICIENCY
I THINK THAT HE HAS RIGHTLY DISTINGUISHED TWO KINDS OF LOVE
BUT MY ART FURTHER INFORMS ME THAT THE DOUBLE LOVE IS NOT MERELY AN
AFFECTION OF THE SOUL OF MAN TOWARDS THE FAIR OR TOWARDS ANYTHING BUT
IS TO BE FOUND IN THE BODIES OF ALL ANIMALS AND IN PRODUCTIONS OF THE
EARTH AND I MAY SAY IN ALL THAT IS SUCH IS THE CONCLUSION WHICH I SEEM
TO HAVE GATHERED FROM MY OWN ART OF MEDICINE WHENCE I LEARN HOW GREAT
AND WONDERFUL AND UNIVERSAL IS THE DEITY OF LOVE WHOSE EMPIRE EXTENDS
OVER ALL THINGS DIVINE AS WELL AS HUMAN
AND FROM MEDICINE I WILL BEGIN
THAT I MAY DO HONOUR TO MY ART
THERE ARE IN THE HUMAN BODY THESE TWO
KINDS OF LOVE WHICH ARE CONFESSEDLY DIFFERENT AND UNLIKE AND BEING
UNLIKE THEY HAVE LOVES AND DESIRES WHICH ARE UNLIKE AND THE DESIRE OF
THE HEALTHY IS ONE AND THE DESIRE OF THE DISEASED IS ANOTHER AND AS
PAUSANIAS WAS JUST NOW SAYING THAT TO INDULGE GOOD MEN IS HONOURABLE
AND BAD MEN DISHONOURABLE SO TOO IN THE BODY THE GOOD AND HEALTHY
ELEMENTS ARE TO BE INDULGED AND THE BAD ELEMENTS AND THE ELEMENTS OF
DISEASE ARE NOT TO BE INDULGED BUT DISCOURAGED
AND THIS IS WHAT THE
PHYSICIAN HAS TO DO AND IN THIS THE ART OF MEDICINE CONSISTS FOR
MEDICINE MAY BE REGARDED GENERALLY AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOVES AND
DESIRES OF THE BODY AND HOW TO SATISFY THEM OR NOT AND THE BEST
PHYSICIAN IS HE WHO IS ABLE TO SEPARATE FAIR LOVE FROM FOUL OR TO
CONVERT ONE INTO THE OTHER AND HE WHO KNOWS HOW TO ERADICATE AND HOW TO
IMPLANT LOVE WHICHEVER IS REQUIRED AND CAN RECONCILE THE MOST HOSTILE
ELEMENTS IN THE CONSTITUTION AND MAKE THEM LOVING FRIENDS IS A SKILFUL
PRACTITIONER
NOW THE MOST HOSTILE ARE THE MOST OPPOSITE SUCH AS
HOT AND COLD BITTER AND SWEET MOIST AND DRY AND THE LIKE
AND MY
ANCESTOR ASCLEPIUS KNOWING HOW TO IMPLANT FRIENDSHIP AND ACCORD IN
THESE ELEMENTS WAS THE CREATOR OF OUR ART AS OUR FRIENDS THE POETS
HERE TELL US AND I BELIEVE THEM AND NOT ONLY MEDICINE IN EVERY BRANCH
BUT THE ARTS OF GYMNASTIC AND HUSBANDRY ARE UNDER HIS DOMINION
ANY ONE
WHO PAYS THE LEAST ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT WILL ALSO PERCEIVE THAT IN
MUSIC THERE IS THE SAME RECONCILIATION OF OPPOSITES AND I SUPPOSE THAT
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN THE MEANING OF HERACLEITUS ALTHOUGH HIS WORDS ARE
NOT ACCURATE FOR HE SAYS THAT THE ONE IS UNITED BY DISUNION LIKE THE
HARMONY OF THE BOW AND THE LYRE
NOW THERE IS AN ABSURDITY SAYING THAT
HARMONY IS DISCORD OR IS COMPOSED OF ELEMENTS WHICH ARE STILL IN A STATE
OF DISCORD
BUT WHAT HE PROBABLY MEANT WAS THAT HARMONY IS COMPOSED OF
DIFFERING NOTES OF HIGHER OR LOWER PITCH WHICH DISAGREED ONCE BUT ARE
NOW RECONCILED BY THE ART OF MUSIC FOR IF THE HIGHER AND LOWER NOTES
STILL DISAGREED THERE COULD BE NO HARMONY CLEARLY NOT
FOR HARMONY
IS A SYMPHONY AND SYMPHONY IS AN AGREEMENT BUT AN AGREEMENT OF
DISAGREEMENTS WHILE THEY DISAGREE THERE CANNOT BE YOU CANNOT HARMONIZE
THAT WHICH DISAGREES
IN LIKE MANNER RHYTHM IS COMPOUNDED OF ELEMENTS
SHORT AND LONG ONCE DIFFERING AND NOW IN ACCORD WHICH ACCORDANCE AS
IN THE FORMER INSTANCE MEDICINE SO IN ALL THESE OTHER CASES MUSIC
IMPLANTS MAKING LOVE AND UNISON TO GROW UP AMONG THEM AND THUS MUSIC
TOO IS CONCERNED WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF LOVE IN THEIR APPLICATION TO
HARMONY AND RHYTHM
AGAIN IN THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF HARMONY AND RHYTHM
THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN DISCERNING LOVE WHICH HAS NOT YET BECOME
DOUBLE
BUT WHEN YOU WANT TO USE THEM IN ACTUAL LIFE EITHER IN THE
COMPOSITION OF SONGS OR IN THE CORRECT PERFORMANCE OF AIRS OR METRES
COMPOSED ALREADY WHICH LATTER IS CALLED EDUCATION THEN THE DIFFICULTY
BEGINS AND THE GOOD ARTIST IS NEEDED
THEN THE OLD TALE HAS TO BE
REPEATED OF FAIR AND HEAVENLY LOVE THE LOVE OF URANIA THE FAIR AND
HEAVENLY MUSE AND OF THE DUTY OF ACCEPTING THE TEMPERATE AND THOSE
WHO ARE AS YET INTEMPERATE ONLY THAT THEY MAY BECOME TEMPERATE AND OF
PRESERVING THEIR LOVE AND AGAIN OF THE VULGAR POLYHYMNIA WHO MUST
BE USED WITH CIRCUMSPECTION THAT THE PLEASURE BE ENJOYED BUT MAY NOT
GENERATE LICENTIOUSNESS JUST AS IN MY OWN ART IT IS A GREAT MATTER SO
TO REGULATE THE DESIRES OF THE EPICURE THAT HE MAY GRATIFY HIS TASTES
WITHOUT THE ATTENDANT EVIL OF DISEASE
WHENCE I INFER THAT IN MUSIC IN
MEDICINE IN ALL OTHER THINGS HUMAN AS WELL AS DIVINE BOTH LOVES OUGHT
TO BE NOTED AS FAR AS MAY BE FOR THEY ARE BOTH PRESENT
THE COURSE OF THE SEASONS IS ALSO FULL OF BOTH THESE PRINCIPLES AND
WHEN AS I WAS SAYING THE ELEMENTS OF HOT AND COLD MOIST AND DRY
ATTAIN THE HARMONIOUS LOVE OF ONE ANOTHER AND BLEND IN TEMPERANCE AND
HARMONY THEY BRING TO MEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS HEALTH AND PLENTY AND
DO THEM NO HARM WHEREAS THE WANTON LOVE GETTING THE UPPER HAND AND
AFFECTING THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR IS VERY DESTRUCTIVE AND INJURIOUS
BEING THE SOURCE OF PESTILENCE AND BRINGING MANY OTHER KINDS OF
DISEASES ON ANIMALS AND PLANTS FOR HOAR FROST AND HAIL AND BLIGHT
SPRING FROM THE EXCESSES AND DISORDERS OF THESE ELEMENTS OF LOVE WHICH
TO KNOW IN RELATION TO THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND THE
SEASONS OF THE YEAR IS TERMED ASTRONOMY
FURTHERMORE ALL SACRIFICES AND
THE WHOLE PROVINCE OF DIVINATION WHICH IS THE ART OF COMMUNION BETWEEN
GODS AND MEN THESE I SAY ARE CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE PRESERVATION
OF THE GOOD AND THE CURE OF THE EVIL LOVE
FOR ALL MANNER OF IMPIETY IS
LIKELY TO ENSUE IF INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING AND HONOURING AND REVERENCING
THE HARMONIOUS LOVE IN ALL HIS ACTIONS A MAN HONOURS THE OTHER LOVE
WHETHER IN HIS FEELINGS TOWARDS GODS OR PARENTS TOWARDS THE LIVING OR
THE DEAD
WHEREFORE THE BUSINESS OF DIVINATION IS TO SEE TO THESE LOVES
AND TO HEAL THEM AND DIVINATION IS THE PEACEMAKER OF GODS AND MEN
WORKING BY A KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELIGIOUS OR IRRELIGIOUS TENDENCIES WHICH
EXIST IN HUMAN LOVES
SUCH IS THE GREAT AND MIGHTY OR RATHER OMNIPOTENT
FORCE OF LOVE IN GENERAL
AND THE LOVE MORE ESPECIALLY WHICH IS
CONCERNED WITH THE GOOD AND WHICH IS PERFECTED IN COMPANY WITH
TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE WHETHER AMONG GODS OR MEN HAS THE GREATEST
POWER AND IS THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR HAPPINESS AND HARMONY AND MAKES US
FRIENDS WITH THE GODS WHO ARE ABOVE US AND WITH ONE ANOTHER
I DARE SAY
THAT I TOO HAVE OMITTED SEVERAL THINGS WHICH MIGHT BE SAID IN PRAISE
OF LOVE BUT THIS WAS NOT INTENTIONAL AND YOU ARISTOPHANES MAY NOW
SUPPLY THE OMISSION OR TAKE SOME OTHER LINE OF COMMENDATION FOR I
PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE RID OF THE HICCOUGH
YES SAID ARISTOPHANES WHO FOLLOWED THE HICCOUGH IS GONE NOT
HOWEVER UNTIL I APPLIED THE SNEEZING AND I WONDER WHETHER THE HARMONY
OF THE BODY HAS A LOVE OF SUCH NOISES AND TICKLINGS FOR I NO SOONER
APPLIED THE SNEEZING THAN I WAS CURED
ERYXIMACHUS SAID BEWARE FRIEND ARISTOPHANES ALTHOUGH YOU ARE GOING
TO SPEAK YOU ARE MAKING FUN OF ME AND I SHALL HAVE TO WATCH AND SEE
WHETHER I CANNOT HAVE A LAUGH AT YOUR EXPENSE WHEN YOU MIGHT SPEAK IN
PEACE
YOU ARE RIGHT SAID ARISTOPHANES LAUGHING
I WILL UNSAY MY WORDS BUT
DO YOU PLEASE NOT TO WATCH ME AS I FEAR THAT IN THE SPEECH WHICH I
AM ABOUT TO MAKE INSTEAD OF OTHERS LAUGHING WITH ME WHICH IS TO THE
MANNER BORN OF OUR MUSE AND WOULD BE ALL THE BETTER I SHALL ONLY BE
LAUGHED AT BY THEM
DO YOU EXPECT TO SHOOT YOUR BOLT AND ESCAPE ARISTOPHANES WELL PERHAPS
IF YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL AND BEAR IN MIND THAT YOU WILL BE CALLED TO
ACCOUNT I MAY BE INDUCED TO LET YOU OFF
ARISTOPHANES PROFESSED TO OPEN ANOTHER VEIN OF DISCOURSE HE HAD A
MIND TO PRAISE LOVE IN ANOTHER WAY UNLIKE THAT EITHER OF PAUSANIAS OR
ERYXIMACHUS
MANKIND HE SAID JUDGING BY THEIR NEGLECT OF HIM HAVE
NEVER AS I THINK AT ALL UNDERSTOOD THE POWER OF LOVE
FOR IF THEY HAD
UNDERSTOOD HIM THEY WOULD SURELY HAVE BUILT NOBLE TEMPLES AND ALTARS
AND OFFERED SOLEMN SACRIFICES IN HIS HONOUR BUT THIS IS NOT DONE AND
MOST CERTAINLY OUGHT TO BE DONE SINCE OF ALL THE GODS HE IS THE BEST
FRIEND OF MEN THE HELPER AND THE HEALER OF THE ILLS WHICH ARE THE GREAT
IMPEDIMENT TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE RACE
I WILL TRY TO DESCRIBE HIS
POWER TO YOU AND YOU SHALL TEACH THE REST OF THE WORLD WHAT I AM
TEACHING YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE LET ME TREAT OF THE NATURE OF MAN AND
WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO IT FOR THE ORIGINAL HUMAN NATURE WAS NOT LIKE
THE PRESENT BUT DIFFERENT
THE SEXES WERE NOT TWO AS THEY ARE NOW BUT
ORIGINALLY THREE IN NUMBER THERE WAS MAN WOMAN AND THE UNION OF THE
TWO HAVING A NAME CORRESPONDING TO THIS DOUBLE NATURE WHICH HAD ONCE
A REAL EXISTENCE BUT IS NOW LOST AND THE WORD 'ANDROGYNOUS' IS ONLY
PRESERVED AS A TERM OF REPROACH
IN THE SECOND PLACE THE PRIMEVAL MAN
WAS ROUND HIS BACK AND SIDES FORMING A CIRCLE AND HE HAD FOUR HANDS
AND FOUR FEET ONE HEAD WITH TWO FACES LOOKING OPPOSITE WAYS SET ON A
ROUND NECK AND PRECISELY ALIKE ALSO FOUR EARS TWO PRIVY MEMBERS
AND THE REMAINDER TO CORRESPOND
HE COULD WALK UPRIGHT AS MEN NOW DO
BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS AS HE PLEASED AND HE COULD ALSO ROLL OVER AND
OVER AT A GREAT PACE TURNING ON HIS FOUR HANDS AND FOUR FEET EIGHT IN
ALL LIKE TUMBLERS GOING OVER AND OVER WITH THEIR LEGS IN THE AIR THIS
WAS WHEN HE WANTED TO RUN FAST
NOW THE SEXES WERE THREE AND SUCH AS I
HAVE DESCRIBED THEM BECAUSE THE SUN MOON AND EARTH ARE THREE AND THE
MAN WAS ORIGINALLY THE CHILD OF THE SUN THE WOMAN OF THE EARTH AND THE
MAN WOMAN OF THE MOON WHICH IS MADE UP OF SUN AND EARTH AND THEY WERE
ALL ROUND AND MOVED ROUND AND ROUND LIKE THEIR PARENTS
TERRIBLE WAS
THEIR MIGHT AND STRENGTH AND THE THOUGHTS OF THEIR HEARTS WERE GREAT
AND THEY MADE AN ATTACK UPON THE GODS OF THEM IS TOLD THE TALE OF OTYS
AND EPHIALTES WHO AS HOMER SAYS DARED TO SCALE HEAVEN AND WOULD
HAVE LAID HANDS UPON THE GODS
DOUBT REIGNED IN THE CELESTIAL COUNCILS
SHOULD THEY KILL THEM AND ANNIHILATE THE RACE WITH THUNDERBOLTS AS THEY
HAD DONE THE GIANTS THEN THERE WOULD BE AN END OF THE SACRIFICES AND
WORSHIP WHICH MEN OFFERED TO THEM BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE GODS
COULD NOT SUFFER THEIR INSOLENCE TO BE UNRESTRAINED
AT LAST AFTER A
GOOD DEAL OF REFLECTION ZEUS DISCOVERED A WAY
HE SAID 'METHINKS I
HAVE A PLAN WHICH WILL HUMBLE THEIR PRIDE AND IMPROVE THEIR MANNERS MEN
SHALL CONTINUE TO EXIST BUT I WILL CUT THEM IN TWO AND THEN THEY WILL
BE DIMINISHED IN STRENGTH AND INCREASED IN NUMBERS THIS WILL HAVE THE
ADVANTAGE OF MAKING THEM MORE PROFITABLE TO US
THEY SHALL WALK UPRIGHT
ON TWO LEGS AND IF THEY CONTINUE INSOLENT AND WILL NOT BE QUIET I WILL
SPLIT THEM AGAIN AND THEY SHALL HOP ABOUT ON A SINGLE LEG HE SPOKE AND
CUT MEN IN TWO LIKE A SORB APPLE WHICH IS HALVED FOR PICKLING OR
AS YOU MIGHT DIVIDE AN EGG WITH A HAIR AND AS HE CUT THEM ONE AFTER
ANOTHER HE BADE APOLLO GIVE THE FACE AND THE HALF OF THE NECK A TURN
IN ORDER THAT THE MAN MIGHT CONTEMPLATE THE SECTION OF HIMSELF HE WOULD
THUS LEARN A LESSON OF HUMILITY
APOLLO WAS ALSO BIDDEN TO HEAL THEIR
WOUNDS AND COMPOSE THEIR FORMS
SO HE GAVE A TURN TO THE FACE AND PULLED
THE SKIN FROM THE SIDES ALL OVER THAT WHICH IN OUR LANGUAGE IS CALLED
THE BELLY LIKE THE PURSES WHICH DRAW IN AND HE MADE ONE MOUTH AT
THE CENTRE WHICH HE FASTENED IN A KNOT THE SAME WHICH IS CALLED THE
NAVEL HE ALSO MOULDED THE BREAST AND TOOK OUT MOST OF THE WRINKLES
MUCH AS A SHOEMAKER MIGHT SMOOTH LEATHER UPON A LAST HE LEFT A FEW
HOWEVER IN THE REGION OF THE BELLY AND NAVEL AS A MEMORIAL OF THE
PRIMEVAL STATE
AFTER THE DIVISION THE TWO PARTS OF MAN EACH DESIRING
HIS OTHER HALF CAME TOGETHER AND THROWING THEIR ARMS ABOUT ONE
ANOTHER ENTWINED IN MUTUAL EMBRACES LONGING TO GROW INTO ONE THEY
WERE ON THE POINT OF DYING FROM HUNGER AND SELF NEGLECT BECAUSE THEY
DID NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING APART AND WHEN ONE OF THE HALVES DIED AND
THE OTHER SURVIVED THE SURVIVOR SOUGHT ANOTHER MATE MAN OR WOMAN AS
WE CALL THEM BEING THE SECTIONS OF ENTIRE MEN OR WOMEN AND CLUNG TO
THAT
THEY WERE BEING DESTROYED WHEN ZEUS IN PITY OF THEM INVENTED A
NEW PLAN HE TURNED THE PARTS OF GENERATION ROUND TO THE FRONT FOR THIS
HAD NOT BEEN ALWAYS THEIR POSITION AND THEY SOWED THE SEED NO LONGER AS
HITHERTO LIKE GRASSHOPPERS IN THE GROUND BUT IN ONE ANOTHER AND AFTER
THE TRANSPOSITION THE MALE GENERATED IN THE FEMALE IN ORDER THAT BY THE
MUTUAL EMBRACES OF MAN AND WOMAN THEY MIGHT BREED AND THE RACE MIGHT
CONTINUE OR IF MAN CAME TO MAN THEY MIGHT BE SATISFIED AND REST AND
GO THEIR WAYS TO THE BUSINESS OF LIFE SO ANCIENT IS THE DESIRE OF ONE
ANOTHER WHICH IS IMPLANTED IN US REUNITING OUR ORIGINAL NATURE MAKING
ONE OF TWO AND HEALING THE STATE OF MAN
EACH OF US WHEN SEPARATED
HAVING ONE SIDE ONLY LIKE A FLAT FISH IS BUT THE INDENTURE OF A MAN
AND HE IS ALWAYS LOOKING FOR HIS OTHER HALF
MEN WHO ARE A SECTION
OF THAT DOUBLE NATURE WHICH WAS ONCE CALLED ANDROGYNOUS ARE LOVERS OF
WOMEN ADULTERERS ARE GENERALLY OF THIS BREED AND ALSO ADULTEROUS WOMEN
WHO LUST AFTER MEN THE WOMEN WHO ARE A SECTION OF THE WOMAN DO NOT CARE
FOR MEN BUT HAVE FEMALE ATTACHMENTS THE FEMALE COMPANIONS ARE OF THIS
SORT
BUT THEY WHO ARE A SECTION OF THE MALE FOLLOW THE MALE AND WHILE
THEY ARE YOUNG BEING SLICES OF THE ORIGINAL MAN THEY HANG ABOUT MEN
AND EMBRACE THEM AND THEY ARE THEMSELVES THE BEST OF BOYS AND YOUTHS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MOST MANLY NATURE
SOME INDEED ASSERT THAT THEY
ARE SHAMELESS BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE FOR THEY DO NOT ACT THUS FROM ANY
WANT OF SHAME BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE VALIANT AND MANLY AND HAVE A MANLY
COUNTENANCE AND THEY EMBRACE THAT WHICH IS LIKE THEM
AND THESE WHEN
THEY GROW UP BECOME OUR STATESMEN AND THESE ONLY WHICH IS A GREAT
PROOF OF THE TRUTH OF WHAT I AM SAVING
WHEN THEY REACH MANHOOD THEY
ARE LOVERS OF YOUTH AND ARE NOT NATURALLY INCLINED TO MARRY OR BEGET
CHILDREN IF AT ALL THEY DO SO ONLY IN OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW BUT THEY
ARE SATISFIED IF THEY MAY BE ALLOWED TO LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER UNWEDDED
AND SUCH A NATURE IS PRONE TO LOVE AND READY TO RETURN LOVE ALWAYS
EMBRACING THAT WHICH IS AKIN TO HIM
AND WHEN ONE OF THEM MEETS WITH HIS
OTHER HALF THE ACTUAL HALF OF HIMSELF WHETHER HE BE A LOVER OF YOUTH
OR A LOVER OF ANOTHER SORT THE PAIR ARE LOST IN AN AMAZEMENT OF LOVE
AND FRIENDSHIP AND INTIMACY AND ONE WILL NOT BE OUT OF THE OTHER'S
SIGHT AS I MAY SAY EVEN FOR A MOMENT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO PASS
THEIR WHOLE LIVES TOGETHER YET THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT THEY DESIRE
OF ONE ANOTHER
FOR THE INTENSE YEARNING WHICH EACH OF THEM HAS TOWARDS
THE OTHER DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE DESIRE OF LOVER'S INTERCOURSE BUT
OF SOMETHING ELSE WHICH THE SOUL OF EITHER EVIDENTLY DESIRES AND CANNOT
TELL AND OF WHICH SHE HAS ONLY A DARK AND DOUBTFUL PRESENTIMENT
SUPPOSE HEPHAESTUS WITH HIS INSTRUMENTS TO COME TO THE PAIR WHO ARE
LYING SIDE BY SIDE AND TO SAY TO THEM 'WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT OF ONE
ANOTHER THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
AND SUPPOSE FURTHER THAT
WHEN HE SAW THEIR PERPLEXITY HE SAID 'DO YOU DESIRE TO BE WHOLLY ONE
ALWAYS DAY AND NIGHT TO BE IN ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY FOR IF THIS IS WHAT
YOU DESIRE I AM READY TO MELT YOU INTO ONE AND LET YOU GROW TOGETHER
SO THAT BEING TWO YOU SHALL BECOME ONE AND WHILE YOU LIVE LIVE A COMMON
LIFE AS IF YOU WERE A SINGLE MAN AND AFTER YOUR DEATH IN THE WORLD
BELOW STILL BE ONE DEPARTED SOUL INSTEAD OF TWO I ASK WHETHER THIS
IS WHAT YOU LOVINGLY DESIRE AND WHETHER YOU ARE SATISFIED TO ATTAIN
THIS THERE IS NOT A MAN OF THEM WHO WHEN HE HEARD THE PROPOSAL WOULD
DENY OR WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS MEETING AND MELTING INTO ONE
ANOTHER THIS BECOMING ONE INSTEAD OF TWO WAS THE VERY EXPRESSION OF
HIS ANCIENT NEED COMPARE ARIST
POL
AND THE REASON IS THAT HUMAN
NATURE WAS ORIGINALLY ONE AND WE WERE A WHOLE AND THE DESIRE AND
PURSUIT OF THE WHOLE IS CALLED LOVE
THERE WAS A TIME I SAY WHEN WE
WERE ONE BUT NOW BECAUSE OF THE WICKEDNESS OF MANKIND GOD HAS DISPERSED
US AS THE ARCADIANS WERE DISPERSED INTO VILLAGES BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS
COMPARE ARIST
POL
AND IF WE ARE NOT OBEDIENT TO THE GODS THERE IS
A DANGER THAT WE SHALL BE SPLIT UP AGAIN AND GO ABOUT IN BASSO RELIEVO
LIKE THE PROFILE FIGURES HAVING ONLY HALF A NOSE WHICH ARE SCULPTURED
ON MONUMENTS AND THAT WE SHALL BE LIKE TALLIES
WHEREFORE LET US EXHORT
ALL MEN TO PIETY THAT WE MAY AVOID EVIL AND OBTAIN THE GOOD OF WHICH
LOVE IS TO US THE LORD AND MINISTER AND LET NO ONE OPPOSE HIM HE IS
THE ENEMY OF THE GODS WHO OPPOSES HIM
FOR IF WE ARE FRIENDS OF THE GOD
AND AT PEACE WITH HIM WE SHALL FIND OUR OWN TRUE LOVES WHICH RARELY
HAPPENS IN THIS WORLD AT PRESENT
I AM SERIOUS AND THEREFORE I MUST BEG
ERYXIMACHUS NOT TO MAKE FUN OR TO FIND ANY ALLUSION IN WHAT I AM SAYING
TO PAUSANIAS AND AGATHON WHO AS I SUSPECT ARE BOTH OF THE MANLY
NATURE AND BELONG TO THE CLASS WHICH I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING
BUT MY
WORDS HAVE A WIDER APPLICATION THEY INCLUDE MEN AND WOMEN EVERYWHERE
AND I BELIEVE THAT IF OUR LOVES WERE PERFECTLY ACCOMPLISHED AND EACH
ONE RETURNING TO HIS PRIMEVAL NATURE HAD HIS ORIGINAL TRUE LOVE THEN
OUR RACE WOULD BE HAPPY
AND IF THIS WOULD BE BEST OF ALL THE BEST
IN THE NEXT DEGREE AND UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES MUST BE THE NEAREST
APPROACH TO SUCH AN UNION AND THAT WILL BE THE ATTAINMENT OF A
CONGENIAL LOVE
WHEREFORE IF WE WOULD PRAISE HIM WHO HAS GIVEN TO
US THE BENEFIT WE MUST PRAISE THE GOD LOVE WHO IS OUR GREATEST
BENEFACTOR BOTH LEADING US IN THIS LIFE BACK TO OUR OWN NATURE AND
GIVING US HIGH HOPES FOR THE FUTURE FOR HE PROMISES THAT IF WE ARE
PIOUS HE WILL RESTORE US TO OUR ORIGINAL STATE AND HEAL US AND MAKE
US HAPPY AND BLESSED
THIS ERYXIMACHUS IS MY DISCOURSE OF LOVE WHICH
ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TO YOURS I MUST BEG YOU TO LEAVE UNASSAILED BY THE
SHAFTS OF YOUR RIDICULE IN ORDER THAT EACH MAY HAVE HIS TURN EACH OR
RATHER EITHER FOR AGATHON AND SOCRATES ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT
INDEED I AM NOT GOING TO ATTACK YOU SAID ERYXIMACHUS FOR I THOUGHT
YOUR SPEECH CHARMING AND DID I NOT KNOW THAT AGATHON AND SOCRATES ARE
MASTERS IN THE ART OF LOVE I SHOULD BE REALLY AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD
HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AFTER THE WORLD OF THINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN SAID
ALREADY
BUT FOR ALL THAT I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPES
SOCRATES SAID YOU PLAYED YOUR PART WELL ERYXIMACHUS BUT IF YOU WERE
AS I AM NOW OR RATHER AS I SHALL BE WHEN AGATHON HAS SPOKEN YOU WOULD
INDEED BE IN A GREAT STRAIT
YOU WANT TO CAST A SPELL OVER ME SOCRATES SAID AGATHON IN THE HOPE
THAT I MAY BE DISCONCERTED AT THE EXPECTATION RAISED AMONG THE AUDIENCE
THAT I SHALL SPEAK WELL
I SHOULD BE STRANGELY FORGETFUL AGATHON REPLIED SOCRATES OF THE
COURAGE AND MAGNANIMITY WHICH YOU SHOWED WHEN YOUR OWN COMPOSITIONS WERE
ABOUT TO BE EXHIBITED AND YOU CAME UPON THE STAGE WITH THE ACTORS AND
FACED THE VAST THEATRE ALTOGETHER UNDISMAYED IF I THOUGHT THAT YOUR
NERVES COULD BE FLUTTERED AT A SMALL PARTY OF FRIENDS
DO YOU THINK SOCRATES SAID AGATHON THAT MY HEAD IS SO FULL OF THE
THEATRE AS NOT TO KNOW HOW MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE TO A MAN OF SENSE A FEW
GOOD JUDGES ARE THAN MANY FOOLS
NAY REPLIED SOCRATES I SHOULD BE VERY WRONG IN ATTRIBUTING TO YOU
AGATHON THAT OR ANY OTHER WANT OF REFINEMENT
AND I AM QUITE AWARE THAT
IF YOU HAPPENED TO MEET WITH ANY WHOM YOU THOUGHT WISE YOU WOULD CARE
FOR THEIR OPINION MUCH MORE THAN FOR THAT OF THE MANY
BUT THEN WE
HAVING BEEN A PART OF THE FOOLISH MANY IN THE THEATRE CANNOT BE
REGARDED AS THE SELECT WISE THOUGH I KNOW THAT IF YOU CHANCED TO BE IN
THE PRESENCE NOT OF ONE OF OURSELVES BUT OF SOME REALLY WISE MAN YOU
WOULD BE ASHAMED OF DISGRACING YOURSELF BEFORE HIM WOULD YOU NOT
YES SAID AGATHON
BUT BEFORE THE MANY YOU WOULD NOT BE ASHAMED IF YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU
WERE DOING SOMETHING DISGRACEFUL IN THEIR PRESENCE
HERE PHAEDRUS INTERRUPTED THEM SAYING NOT ANSWER HIM MY DEAR AGATHON
FOR IF HE CAN ONLY GET A PARTNER WITH WHOM HE CAN TALK ESPECIALLY A
GOOD LOOKING ONE HE WILL NO LONGER CARE ABOUT THE COMPLETION OF OUR
PLAN
NOW I LOVE TO HEAR HIM TALK BUT JUST AT PRESENT I MUST NOT FORGET
THE ENCOMIUM ON LOVE WHICH I OUGHT TO RECEIVE FROM HIM AND FROM EVERY
ONE
WHEN YOU AND HE HAVE PAID YOUR TRIBUTE TO THE GOD THEN YOU MAY
TALK
VERY GOOD PHAEDRUS SAID AGATHON I SEE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT
PROCEED WITH MY SPEECH AS I SHALL HAVE MANY OTHER OPPORTUNITIES OF
CONVERSING WITH SOCRATES
LET ME SAY FIRST HOW I OUGHT TO SPEAK AND
THEN SPEAK
THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS INSTEAD OF PRAISING THE GOD LOVE OR UNFOLDING
HIS NATURE APPEAR TO HAVE CONGRATULATED MANKIND ON THE BENEFITS WHICH
HE CONFERS UPON THEM
BUT I WOULD RATHER PRAISE THE GOD FIRST AND THEN
SPEAK OF HIS GIFTS THIS IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT WAY OF PRAISING EVERYTHING
MAY I SAY WITHOUT IMPIETY OR OFFENCE THAT OF ALL THE BLESSED GODS HE
IS THE MOST BLESSED BECAUSE HE IS THE FAIREST AND BEST AND HE IS THE
FAIREST FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE HE IS THE YOUNGEST AND OF HIS YOUTH
HE IS HIMSELF THE WITNESS FLEEING OUT OF THE WAY OF AGE WHO IS SWIFT
ENOUGH SWIFTER TRULY THAN MOST OF US LIKE LOVE HATES HIM AND WILL NOT
COME NEAR HIM BUT YOUTH AND LOVE LIVE AND MOVE TOGETHER LIKE TO LIKE
AS THE PROVERB SAYS
MANY THINGS WERE SAID BY PHAEDRUS ABOUT LOVE IN
WHICH I AGREE WITH HIM BUT I CANNOT AGREE THAT HE IS OLDER THAN IAPETUS
AND KRONOS NOT SO I MAINTAIN HIM TO BE THE YOUNGEST OF THE GODS AND
YOUTHFUL EVER
THE ANCIENT DOINGS AMONG THE GODS OF WHICH HESIOD
AND PARMENIDES SPOKE IF THE TRADITION OF THEM BE TRUE WERE DONE OF
NECESSITY AND NOT OF LOVE HAD LOVE BEEN IN THOSE DAYS THERE WOULD HAVE
BEEN NO CHAINING OR MUTILATION OF THE GODS OR OTHER VIOLENCE BUT PEACE
AND SWEETNESS AS THERE IS NOW IN HEAVEN SINCE THE RULE OF LOVE BEGAN
LOVE IS YOUNG AND ALSO TENDER HE OUGHT TO HAVE A POET LIKE HOMER TO
DESCRIBE HIS TENDERNESS AS HOMER SAYS OF ATE THAT SHE IS A GODDESS AND
TENDER
'HER FEET ARE TENDER FOR SHE SETS HER STEPS NOT ON THE GROUND BUT ON
THE HEADS OF MEN
HEREIN IS AN EXCELLENT PROOF OF HER TENDERNESS THAT SHE WALKS NOT
UPON THE HARD BUT UPON THE SOFT
LET US ADDUCE A SIMILAR PROOF OF THE
TENDERNESS OF LOVE FOR HE WALKS NOT UPON THE EARTH NOR YET UPON THE
SKULLS OF MEN WHICH ARE NOT SO VERY SOFT BUT IN THE HEARTS AND SOULS
OF BOTH GODS AND MEN WHICH ARE OF ALL THINGS THE SOFTEST IN THEM
HE WALKS AND DWELLS AND MAKES HIS HOME
NOT IN EVERY SOUL WITHOUT
EXCEPTION FOR WHERE THERE IS HARDNESS HE DEPARTS WHERE THERE IS
SOFTNESS THERE HE DWELLS AND NESTLING ALWAYS WITH HIS FEET AND IN ALL
MANNER OF WAYS IN THE SOFTEST OF SOFT PLACES HOW CAN HE BE OTHER THAN
THE SOFTEST OF ALL THINGS OF A TRUTH HE IS THE TENDEREST AS WELL AS
THE YOUNGEST AND ALSO HE IS OF FLEXILE FORM FOR IF HE WERE HARD AND
WITHOUT FLEXURE HE COULD NOT ENFOLD ALL THINGS OR WIND HIS WAY INTO AND
OUT OF EVERY SOUL OF MAN UNDISCOVERED
AND A PROOF OF HIS FLEXIBILITY
AND SYMMETRY OF FORM IS HIS GRACE WHICH IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED TO BE
IN AN ESPECIAL MANNER THE ATTRIBUTE OF LOVE UNGRACE AND LOVE ARE ALWAYS
AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER
THE FAIRNESS OF HIS COMPLEXION IS REVEALED BY
HIS HABITATION AMONG THE FLOWERS FOR HE DWELLS NOT AMID BLOOMLESS OR
FADING BEAUTIES WHETHER OF BODY OR SOUL OR AUGHT ELSE BUT IN THE PLACE
OF FLOWERS AND SCENTS THERE HE SITS AND ABIDES
CONCERNING THE BEAUTY
OF THE GOD I HAVE SAID ENOUGH AND YET THERE REMAINS MUCH MORE WHICH I
MIGHT SAY
OF HIS VIRTUE I HAVE NOW TO SPEAK HIS GREATEST GLORY IS THAT
HE CAN NEITHER DO NOR SUFFER WRONG TO OR FROM ANY GOD OR ANY MAN FOR
HE SUFFERS NOT BY FORCE IF HE SUFFERS FORCE COMES NOT NEAR HIM NEITHER
WHEN HE ACTS DOES HE ACT BY FORCE
FOR ALL MEN IN ALL THINGS SERVE HIM
OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL AND WHERE THERE IS VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT THERE
AS THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE LORDS OF THE CITY SAY IS JUSTICE
AND
NOT ONLY IS HE JUST BUT EXCEEDINGLY TEMPERATE FOR TEMPERANCE IS THE
ACKNOWLEDGED RULER OF THE PLEASURES AND DESIRES AND NO PLEASURE EVER
MASTERS LOVE HE IS THEIR MASTER AND THEY ARE HIS SERVANTS AND IF HE
CONQUERS THEM HE MUST BE TEMPERATE INDEED
AS TO COURAGE EVEN THE GOD
OF WAR IS NO MATCH FOR HIM HE IS THE CAPTIVE AND LOVE IS THE LORD
FOR LOVE THE LOVE OF APHRODITE MASTERS HIM AS THE TALE RUNS AND THE
MASTER IS STRONGER THAN THE SERVANT
AND IF HE CONQUERS THE BRAVEST OF
ALL OTHERS HE MUST BE HIMSELF THE BRAVEST
OF HIS COURAGE AND JUSTICE
AND TEMPERANCE I HAVE SPOKEN BUT I HAVE YET TO SPEAK OF HIS WISDOM AND
ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF MY ABILITY I MUST TRY TO DO MY BEST
IN THE
FIRST PLACE HE IS A POET AND HERE LIKE ERYXIMACHUS I MAGNIFY MY ART
AND HE IS ALSO THE SOURCE OF POESY IN OTHERS WHICH HE COULD NOT BE IF
HE WERE NOT HIMSELF A POET
AND AT THE TOUCH OF HIM EVERY ONE BECOMES
A POET EVEN THOUGH HE HAD NO MUSIC IN HIM BEFORE A FRAGMENT OF THE
STHENOAOEA OF EURIPIDES THIS ALSO IS A PROOF THAT LOVE IS A GOOD POET
AND ACCOMPLISHED IN ALL THE FINE ARTS FOR NO ONE CAN GIVE TO ANOTHER
THAT WHICH HE HAS NOT HIMSELF OR TEACH THAT OF WHICH HE HAS NO
KNOWLEDGE
WHO WILL DENY THAT THE CREATION OF THE ANIMALS IS HIS DOING
ARE THEY NOT ALL THE WORKS OF HIS WISDOM BORN AND BEGOTTEN OF HIM
AND AS TO THE ARTISTS DO WE NOT KNOW THAT HE ONLY OF THEM WHOM LOVE
INSPIRES HAS THE LIGHT OF FAME HE WHOM LOVE TOUCHES NOT WALKS
IN DARKNESS
THE ARTS OF MEDICINE AND ARCHERY AND DIVINATION WERE
DISCOVERED BY APOLLO UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF LOVE AND DESIRE SO THAT HE
TOO IS A DISCIPLE OF LOVE
ALSO THE MELODY OF THE MUSES THE METALLURGY
OF HEPHAESTUS THE WEAVING OF ATHENE THE EMPIRE OF ZEUS OVER GODS AND
MEN ARE ALL DUE TO LOVE WHO WAS THE INVENTOR OF THEM
AND SO LOVE SET
IN ORDER THE EMPIRE OF THE GODS THE LOVE OF BEAUTY AS IS EVIDENT FOR
WITH DEFORMITY LOVE HAS NO CONCERN
IN THE DAYS OF OLD AS I BEGAN BY
SAYING DREADFUL DEEDS WERE DONE AMONG THE GODS FOR THEY WERE RULED
BY NECESSITY BUT NOW SINCE THE BIRTH OF LOVE AND FROM THE LOVE OF
THE BEAUTIFUL HAS SPRUNG EVERY GOOD IN HEAVEN AND EARTH
THEREFORE
PHAEDRUS I SAY OF LOVE THAT HE IS THE FAIREST AND BEST IN HIMSELF AND
THE CAUSE OF WHAT IS FAIREST AND BEST IN ALL OTHER THINGS
AND THERE
COMES INTO MY MIND A LINE OF POETRY IN WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE THE GOD
WHO
'GIVES PEACE ON EARTH AND CALMS THE STORMY DEEP WHO STILLS THE WINDS
AND BIDS THE SUFFERER SLEEP
THIS IS HE WHO EMPTIES MEN OF DISAFFECTION AND FILLS THEM WITH
AFFECTION WHO MAKES THEM TO MEET TOGETHER AT BANQUETS SUCH AS THESE IN
SACRIFICES FEASTS DANCES HE IS OUR LORD WHO SENDS COURTESY AND SENDS
AWAY DISCOURTESY WHO GIVES KINDNESS EVER AND NEVER GIVES UNKINDNESS
THE FRIEND OF THE GOOD THE WONDER OF THE WISE THE AMAZEMENT OF THE
GODS DESIRED BY THOSE WHO HAVE NO PART IN HIM AND PRECIOUS TO THOSE
WHO HAVE THE BETTER PART IN HIM PARENT OF DELICACY LUXURY DESIRE
FONDNESS SOFTNESS GRACE REGARDFUL OF THE GOOD REGARDLESS OF THE
EVIL IN EVERY WORD WORK WISH FEAR SAVIOUR PILOT COMRADE HELPER
GLORY OF GODS AND MEN LEADER BEST AND BRIGHTEST IN WHOSE FOOTSTEPS
LET EVERY MAN FOLLOW SWEETLY SINGING IN HIS HONOUR AND JOINING IN THAT
SWEET STRAIN WITH WHICH LOVE CHARMS THE SOULS OF GODS AND MEN
SUCH
IS THE SPEECH PHAEDRUS HALF PLAYFUL YET HAVING A CERTAIN MEASURE OF
SERIOUSNESS WHICH ACCORDING TO MY ABILITY I DEDICATE TO THE GOD
WHEN AGATHON HAD DONE SPEAKING ARISTODEMUS SAID THAT THERE WAS A
GENERAL CHEER THE YOUNG MAN WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN IN A MANNER
WORTHY OF HIMSELF AND OF THE GOD
AND SOCRATES LOOKING AT ERYXIMACHUS
SAID TELL ME SON OF ACUMENUS WAS THERE NOT REASON IN MY FEARS AND
WAS I NOT A TRUE PROPHET WHEN I SAID THAT AGATHON WOULD MAKE A WONDERFUL
ORATION AND THAT I SHOULD BE IN A STRAIT
THE PART OF THE PROPHECY WHICH CONCERNS AGATHON REPLIED ERYXIMACHUS
APPEARS TO ME TO BE TRUE BUT NOT THE OTHER PART THAT YOU WILL BE IN A
STRAIT
WHY MY DEAR FRIEND SAID SOCRATES MUST NOT I OR ANY ONE BE IN A STRAIT
WHO HAS TO SPEAK AFTER HE HAS HEARD SUCH A RICH AND VARIED DISCOURSE I
AM ESPECIALLY STRUCK WITH THE BEAUTY OF THE CONCLUDING WORDS WHO COULD
LISTEN TO THEM WITHOUT AMAZEMENT WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE IMMEASURABLE
INFERIORITY OF MY OWN POWERS I WAS READY TO RUN AWAY FOR SHAME IF
THERE HAD BEEN A POSSIBILITY OF ESCAPE
FOR I WAS REMINDED OF GORGIAS
AND AT THE END OF HIS SPEECH I FANCIED THAT AGATHON WAS SHAKING AT ME
THE GORGINIAN OR GORGONIAN HEAD OF THE GREAT MASTER OF RHETORIC WHICH
WAS SIMPLY TO TURN ME AND MY SPEECH INTO STONE AS HOMER SAYS ODYSSEY
AND STRIKE ME DUMB
AND THEN I PERCEIVED HOW FOOLISH I HAD BEEN IN
CONSENTING TO TAKE MY TURN WITH YOU IN PRAISING LOVE AND SAYING THAT
I TOO WAS A MASTER OF THE ART WHEN I REALLY HAD NO CONCEPTION HOW
ANYTHING OUGHT TO BE PRAISED
FOR IN MY SIMPLICITY I IMAGINED THAT THE
TOPICS OF PRAISE SHOULD BE TRUE AND THAT THIS BEING PRESUPPOSED OUT
OF THE TRUE THE SPEAKER WAS TO CHOOSE THE BEST AND SET THEM FORTH IN THE
BEST MANNER
AND I FELT QUITE PROUD THINKING THAT I KNEW THE NATURE OF
TRUE PRAISE AND SHOULD SPEAK WELL
WHEREAS I NOW SEE THAT THE INTENTION
WAS TO ATTRIBUTE TO LOVE EVERY SPECIES OF GREATNESS AND GLORY
WHETHER REALLY BELONGING TO HIM OR NOT WITHOUT REGARD TO TRUTH OR
FALSEHOOD THAT WAS NO MATTER FOR THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL SEEMS TO HAVE
BEEN NOT THAT EACH OF YOU SHOULD REALLY PRAISE LOVE BUT ONLY THAT
YOU SHOULD APPEAR TO PRAISE HIM
AND SO YOU ATTRIBUTE TO LOVE EVERY
IMAGINABLE FORM OF PRAISE WHICH CAN BE GATHERED ANYWHERE AND YOU SAY
THAT 'HE IS ALL THIS AND 'THE CAUSE OF ALL THAT MAKING HIM APPEAR
THE FAIREST AND BEST OF ALL TO THOSE WHO KNOW HIM NOT FOR YOU CANNOT
IMPOSE UPON THOSE WHO KNOW HIM
AND A NOBLE AND SOLEMN HYMN OF PRAISE
HAVE YOU REHEARSED
BUT AS I MISUNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PRAISE WHEN
I SAID THAT I WOULD TAKE MY TURN I MUST BEG TO BE ABSOLVED FROM THE
PROMISE WHICH I MADE IN IGNORANCE AND WHICH AS EURIPIDES WOULD SAY
EURIP
HYPPOLYTUS WAS A PROMISE OF THE LIPS AND NOT OF THE MIND
FAREWELL THEN TO SUCH A STRAIN FOR I DO NOT PRAISE IN THAT WAY NO
INDEED I CANNOT
BUT IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE I
AM READY TO SPEAK IN MY OWN MANNER THOUGH I WILL NOT MAKE MYSELF
RIDICULOUS BY ENTERING INTO ANY RIVALRY WITH YOU
SAY THEN PHAEDRUS
WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE SPOKEN IN ANY WORDS
AND IN ANY ORDER WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO COME INTO MY MIND AT THE TIME
WILL
THAT BE AGREEABLE TO YOU
ARISTODEMUS SAID THAT PHAEDRUS AND THE COMPANY BID HIM SPEAK IN
ANY MANNER WHICH HE THOUGHT BEST
THEN HE ADDED LET ME HAVE YOUR
PERMISSION FIRST TO ASK AGATHON A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IN ORDER THAT I
MAY TAKE HIS ADMISSIONS AS THE PREMISSES OF MY DISCOURSE
I GRANT THE PERMISSION SAID PHAEDRUS PUT YOUR QUESTIONS
SOCRATES THEN
PROCEEDED AS FOLLOWS
IN THE MAGNIFICENT ORATION WHICH YOU HAVE JUST UTTERED I THINK THAT YOU
WERE RIGHT MY DEAR AGATHON IN PROPOSING TO SPEAK OF THE NATURE OF LOVE
FIRST AND AFTERWARDS OF HIS WORKS THAT IS A WAY OF BEGINNING WHICH I
VERY MUCH APPROVE
AND AS YOU HAVE SPOKEN SO ELOQUENTLY OF HIS NATURE
MAY I ASK YOU FURTHER WHETHER LOVE IS THE LOVE OF SOMETHING OR OF
NOTHING AND HERE I MUST EXPLAIN MYSELF I DO NOT WANT YOU TO SAY THAT
LOVE IS THE LOVE OF A FATHER OR THE LOVE OF A MOTHER THAT WOULD BE
RIDICULOUS BUT TO ANSWER AS YOU WOULD IF I ASKED IS A FATHER A FATHER
OF SOMETHING TO WHICH YOU WOULD FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN REPLYING OF A
SON OR DAUGHTER AND THE ANSWER WOULD BE RIGHT
VERY TRUE SAID AGATHON
AND YOU WOULD SAY THE SAME OF A MOTHER
HE ASSENTED
YET LET ME ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING
IS NOT A BROTHER TO BE REGARDED ESSENTIALLY AS A BROTHER OF SOMETHING
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
THAT IS OF A BROTHER OR SISTER
YES HE SAID
AND NOW SAID SOCRATES I WILL ASK ABOUT LOVE IS LOVE OF SOMETHING OR
OF NOTHING
OF SOMETHING SURELY HE REPLIED
KEEP IN MIND WHAT THIS IS AND TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER LOVE
DESIRES THAT OF WHICH LOVE IS
YES SURELY
AND DOES HE POSSESS OR DOES HE NOT POSSESS THAT WHICH HE LOVES AND
DESIRES
PROBABLY NOT I SHOULD SAY
NAY REPLIED SOCRATES I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER WHETHER 'NECESSARILY'
IS NOT RATHER THE WORD
THE INFERENCE THAT HE WHO DESIRES SOMETHING
IS IN WANT OF SOMETHING AND THAT HE WHO DESIRES NOTHING IS IN WANT OF
NOTHING IS IN MY JUDGMENT AGATHON ABSOLUTELY AND NECESSARILY TRUE
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I AGREE WITH YOU SAID AGATHON
VERY GOOD
WOULD HE WHO IS GREAT DESIRE TO BE GREAT OR HE WHO IS
STRONG DESIRE TO BE STRONG
THAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR PREVIOUS ADMISSIONS
TRUE
FOR HE WHO IS ANYTHING CANNOT WANT TO BE THAT WHICH HE IS
VERY TRUE
AND YET ADDED SOCRATES IF A MAN BEING STRONG DESIRED TO BE STRONG OR
BEING SWIFT DESIRED TO BE SWIFT OR BEING HEALTHY DESIRED TO BE HEALTHY
IN THAT CASE HE MIGHT BE THOUGHT TO DESIRE SOMETHING WHICH HE ALREADY
HAS OR IS
I GIVE THE EXAMPLE IN ORDER THAT WE MAY AVOID MISCONCEPTION
FOR THE POSSESSORS OF THESE QUALITIES AGATHON MUST BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
THEIR RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES AT THE TIME WHETHER THEY CHOOSE OR NOT AND
WHO CAN DESIRE THAT WHICH HE HAS THEREFORE WHEN A PERSON SAYS I AM
WELL AND WISH TO BE WELL OR I AM RICH AND WISH TO BE RICH AND I DESIRE
SIMPLY TO HAVE WHAT I HAVE TO HIM WE SHALL REPLY 'YOU MY FRIEND
HAVING WEALTH AND HEALTH AND STRENGTH WANT TO HAVE THE CONTINUANCE OF
THEM FOR AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER YOU CHOOSE OR NO YOU HAVE THEM
AND
WHEN YOU SAY I DESIRE THAT WHICH I HAVE AND NOTHING ELSE IS NOT YOUR
MEANING THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE WHAT YOU NOW HAVE IN THE FUTURE HE MUST
AGREE WITH US MUST HE NOT
HE MUST REPLIED AGATHON
THEN SAID SOCRATES HE DESIRES THAT WHAT HE HAS AT PRESENT MAY BE
PRESERVED TO HIM IN THE FUTURE WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT HE
DESIRES SOMETHING WHICH IS NON EXISTENT TO HIM AND WHICH AS YET HE HAS
NOT GOT
VERY TRUE HE SAID
THEN HE AND EVERY ONE WHO DESIRES DESIRES THAT WHICH HE HAS NOT
ALREADY AND WHICH IS FUTURE AND NOT PRESENT AND WHICH HE HAS NOT AND
IS NOT AND OF WHICH HE IS IN WANT THESE ARE THE SORT OF THINGS WHICH
LOVE AND DESIRE SEEK
VERY TRUE HE SAID
THEN NOW SAID SOCRATES LET US RECAPITULATE THE ARGUMENT
FIRST IS NOT
LOVE OF SOMETHING AND OF SOMETHING TOO WHICH IS WANTING TO A MAN
YES HE REPLIED
REMEMBER FURTHER WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR SPEECH OR IF YOU DO NOT REMEMBER
I WILL REMIND YOU YOU SAID THAT THE LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL SET IN
ORDER THE EMPIRE OF THE GODS FOR THAT OF DEFORMED THINGS THERE IS NO
LOVE DID YOU NOT SAY SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
YES SAID AGATHON
YES MY FRIEND AND THE REMARK WAS A JUST ONE
AND IF THIS IS TRUE LOVE
IS THE LOVE OF BEAUTY AND NOT OF DEFORMITY
HE ASSENTED
AND THE ADMISSION HAS BEEN ALREADY MADE THAT LOVE IS OF SOMETHING WHICH
A MAN WANTS AND HAS NOT
TRUE HE SAID
THEN LOVE WANTS AND HAS NOT BEAUTY
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
AND WOULD YOU CALL THAT BEAUTIFUL WHICH WANTS AND DOES NOT POSSESS
BEAUTY
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN WOULD YOU STILL SAY THAT LOVE IS BEAUTIFUL
AGATHON REPLIED I FEAR THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS SAYING
YOU MADE A VERY GOOD SPEECH AGATHON REPLIED SOCRATES BUT THERE IS
YET ONE SMALL QUESTION WHICH I WOULD FAIN ASK IS NOT THE GOOD ALSO THE
BEAUTIFUL
YES
THEN IN WANTING THE BEAUTIFUL LOVE WANTS ALSO THE GOOD
I CANNOT REFUTE YOU SOCRATES SAID AGATHON LET US ASSUME THAT WHAT
YOU SAY IS TRUE
SAY RATHER BELOVED AGATHON THAT YOU CANNOT REFUTE THE TRUTH FOR
SOCRATES IS EASILY REFUTED
AND NOW TAKING MY LEAVE OF YOU I WOULD REHEARSE A TALE OF LOVE WHICH I
HEARD FROM DIOTIMA OF MANTINEIA COMPARE 1 ALCIBIADES A WOMAN WISE IN
THIS AND IN MANY OTHER KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE WHO IN THE DAYS OF OLD WHEN
THE ATHENIANS OFFERED SACRIFICE BEFORE THE COMING OF THE PLAGUE DELAYED
THE DISEASE TEN YEARS
SHE WAS MY INSTRUCTRESS IN THE ART OF LOVE AND
I SHALL REPEAT TO YOU WHAT SHE SAID TO ME BEGINNING WITH THE ADMISSIONS
MADE BY AGATHON WHICH ARE NEARLY IF NOT QUITE THE SAME WHICH I MADE
TO THE WISE WOMAN WHEN SHE QUESTIONED ME I THINK THAT THIS WILL BE
THE EASIEST WAY AND I SHALL TAKE BOTH PARTS MYSELF AS WELL AS I CAN
COMPARE GORGIAS
AS YOU AGATHON SUGGESTED SUPRA I MUST SPEAK
FIRST OF THE BEING AND NATURE OF LOVE AND THEN OF HIS WORKS
FIRST I
SAID TO HER IN NEARLY THE SAME WORDS WHICH HE USED TO ME THAT LOVE WAS
A MIGHTY GOD AND LIKEWISE FAIR AND SHE PROVED TO ME AS I PROVED TO HIM
THAT BY MY OWN SHOWING LOVE WAS NEITHER FAIR NOR GOOD
'WHAT DO YOU
MEAN DIOTIMA I SAID 'IS LOVE THEN EVIL AND FOUL 'HUSH SHE CRIED
'MUST THAT BE FOUL WHICH IS NOT FAIR 'CERTAINLY I SAID
'AND IS THAT
WHICH IS NOT WISE IGNORANT DO YOU NOT SEE THAT THERE IS A MEAN BETWEEN
WISDOM AND IGNORANCE 'AND WHAT MAY THAT BE I SAID
'RIGHT OPINION
SHE REPLIED 'WHICH AS YOU KNOW BEING INCAPABLE OF GIVING A REASON
IS NOT KNOWLEDGE FOR HOW CAN KNOWLEDGE BE DEVOID OF REASON NOR AGAIN
IGNORANCE FOR NEITHER CAN IGNORANCE ATTAIN THE TRUTH BUT IS CLEARLY
SOMETHING WHICH IS A MEAN BETWEEN IGNORANCE AND WISDOM 'QUITE TRUE
I REPLIED
'DO NOT THEN INSIST SHE SAID 'THAT WHAT IS NOT FAIR IS OF
NECESSITY FOUL OR WHAT IS NOT GOOD EVIL OR INFER THAT BECAUSE LOVE
IS NOT FAIR AND GOOD HE IS THEREFORE FOUL AND EVIL FOR HE IS IN A MEAN
BETWEEN THEM 'WELL I SAID 'LOVE IS SURELY ADMITTED BY ALL TO BE A
GREAT GOD 'BY THOSE WHO KNOW OR BY THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW 'BY ALL
'AND HOW SOCRATES SHE SAID WITH A SMILE 'CAN LOVE BE ACKNOWLEDGED TO
BE A GREAT GOD BY THOSE WHO SAY THAT HE IS NOT A GOD AT ALL 'AND WHO
ARE THEY I SAID
'YOU AND I ARE TWO OF THEM SHE REPLIED
'HOW CAN
THAT BE I SAID
'IT IS QUITE INTELLIGIBLE SHE REPLIED 'FOR YOU
YOURSELF WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE GODS ARE HAPPY AND FAIR OF COURSE
YOU WOULD WOULD YOU DARE TO SAY THAT ANY GOD WAS NOT 'CERTAINLY NOT
I REPLIED
'AND YOU MEAN BY THE HAPPY THOSE WHO ARE THE POSSESSORS OF
THINGS GOOD OR FAIR 'YES 'AND YOU ADMITTED THAT LOVE BECAUSE HE
WAS IN WANT DESIRES THOSE GOOD AND FAIR THINGS OF WHICH HE IS IN WANT
'YES I DID 'BUT HOW CAN HE BE A GOD WHO HAS NO PORTION IN WHAT IS
EITHER GOOD OR FAIR 'IMPOSSIBLE 'THEN YOU SEE THAT YOU ALSO DENY THE
DIVINITY OF LOVE
'WHAT THEN IS LOVE I ASKED 'IS HE MORTAL 'NO 'WHAT THEN 'AS IN
THE FORMER INSTANCE HE IS NEITHER MORTAL NOR IMMORTAL BUT IN A MEAN
BETWEEN THE TWO 'WHAT IS HE DIOTIMA 'HE IS A GREAT SPIRIT DAIMON
AND LIKE ALL SPIRITS HE IS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE DIVINE AND THE
MORTAL 'AND WHAT I SAID 'IS HIS POWER 'HE INTERPRETS SHE
REPLIED 'BETWEEN GODS AND MEN CONVEYING AND TAKING ACROSS TO THE GODS
THE PRAYERS AND SACRIFICES OF MEN AND TO MEN THE COMMANDS AND REPLIES
OF THE GODS HE IS THE MEDIATOR WHO SPANS THE CHASM WHICH DIVIDES THEM
AND THEREFORE IN HIM ALL IS BOUND TOGETHER AND THROUGH HIM THE ARTS OF
THE PROPHET AND THE PRIEST THEIR SACRIFICES AND MYSTERIES AND CHARMS
AND ALL PROPHECY AND INCANTATION FIND THEIR WAY
FOR GOD MINGLES NOT
WITH MAN BUT THROUGH LOVE ALL THE INTERCOURSE AND CONVERSE OF GOD
WITH MAN WHETHER AWAKE OR ASLEEP IS CARRIED ON
THE WISDOM WHICH
UNDERSTANDS THIS IS SPIRITUAL ALL OTHER WISDOM SUCH AS THAT OF ARTS
AND HANDICRAFTS IS MEAN AND VULGAR
NOW THESE SPIRITS OR INTERMEDIATE
POWERS ARE MANY AND DIVERSE AND ONE OF THEM IS LOVE 'AND WHO I
SAID 'WAS HIS FATHER AND WHO HIS MOTHER 'THE TALE SHE SAID 'WILL
TAKE TIME NEVERTHELESS I WILL TELL YOU
ON THE BIRTHDAY OF APHRODITE
THERE WAS A FEAST OF THE GODS AT WHICH THE GOD POROS OR PLENTY WHO IS
THE SON OF METIS OR DISCRETION WAS ONE OF THE GUESTS
WHEN THE FEAST
WAS OVER PENIA OR POVERTY AS THE MANNER IS ON SUCH OCCASIONS CAME
ABOUT THE DOORS TO BEG
NOW PLENTY WHO WAS THE WORSE FOR NECTAR THERE
WAS NO WINE IN THOSE DAYS WENT INTO THE GARDEN OF ZEUS AND FELL INTO
A HEAVY SLEEP AND POVERTY CONSIDERING HER OWN STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
PLOTTED TO HAVE A CHILD BY HIM AND ACCORDINGLY SHE LAY DOWN AT HIS SIDE
AND CONCEIVED LOVE WHO PARTLY BECAUSE HE IS NATURALLY A LOVER OF THE
BEAUTIFUL AND BECAUSE APHRODITE IS HERSELF BEAUTIFUL AND ALSO BECAUSE
HE WAS BORN ON HER BIRTHDAY IS HER FOLLOWER AND ATTENDANT
AND AS HIS
PARENTAGE IS SO ALSO ARE HIS FORTUNES
IN THE FIRST PLACE HE IS ALWAYS
POOR AND ANYTHING BUT TENDER AND FAIR AS THE MANY IMAGINE HIM AND HE
IS ROUGH AND SQUALID AND HAS NO SHOES NOR A HOUSE TO DWELL IN ON THE
BARE EARTH EXPOSED HE LIES UNDER THE OPEN HEAVEN IN THE STREETS OR AT
THE DOORS OF HOUSES TAKING HIS REST AND LIKE HIS MOTHER HE IS ALWAYS
IN DISTRESS
LIKE HIS FATHER TOO WHOM HE ALSO PARTLY RESEMBLES HE IS
ALWAYS PLOTTING AGAINST THE FAIR AND GOOD HE IS BOLD ENTERPRISING
STRONG A MIGHTY HUNTER ALWAYS WEAVING SOME INTRIGUE OR OTHER KEEN IN
THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM FERTILE IN RESOURCES A PHILOSOPHER AT ALL TIMES
TERRIBLE AS AN ENCHANTER SORCERER SOPHIST
HE IS BY NATURE NEITHER
MORTAL NOR IMMORTAL BUT ALIVE AND FLOURISHING AT ONE MOMENT WHEN HE IS
IN PLENTY AND DEAD AT ANOTHER MOMENT AND AGAIN ALIVE BY REASON OF HIS
FATHER'S NATURE
BUT THAT WHICH IS ALWAYS FLOWING IN IS ALWAYS FLOWING
OUT AND SO HE IS NEVER IN WANT AND NEVER IN WEALTH AND FURTHER HE
IS IN A MEAN BETWEEN IGNORANCE AND KNOWLEDGE
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
IS THIS NO GOD IS A PHILOSOPHER OR SEEKER AFTER WISDOM FOR HE IS WISE
ALREADY NOR DOES ANY MAN WHO IS WISE SEEK AFTER WISDOM
NEITHER DO THE
IGNORANT SEEK AFTER WISDOM
FOR HEREIN IS THE EVIL OF IGNORANCE THAT HE
WHO IS NEITHER GOOD NOR WISE IS NEVERTHELESS SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
HE HAS NO DESIRE FOR THAT OF WHICH HE FEELS NO WANT 'BUT WHO THEN
DIOTIMA I SAID 'ARE THE LOVERS OF WISDOM IF THEY ARE NEITHER THE
WISE NOR THE FOOLISH 'A CHILD MAY ANSWER THAT QUESTION SHE REPLIED
'THEY ARE THOSE WHO ARE IN A MEAN BETWEEN THE TWO LOVE IS ONE OF THEM
FOR WISDOM IS A MOST BEAUTIFUL THING AND LOVE IS OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND
THEREFORE LOVE IS ALSO A PHILOSOPHER OR LOVER OF WISDOM AND BEING A
LOVER OF WISDOM IS IN A MEAN BETWEEN THE WISE AND THE IGNORANT
AND OF
THIS TOO HIS BIRTH IS THE CAUSE FOR HIS FATHER IS WEALTHY AND WISE AND
HIS MOTHER POOR AND FOOLISH
SUCH MY DEAR SOCRATES IS THE NATURE OF
THE SPIRIT LOVE
THE ERROR IN YOUR CONCEPTION OF HIM WAS VERY NATURAL
AND AS I IMAGINE FROM WHAT YOU SAY HAS ARISEN OUT OF A CONFUSION OF
LOVE AND THE BELOVED WHICH MADE YOU THINK THAT LOVE WAS ALL BEAUTIFUL
FOR THE BELOVED IS THE TRULY BEAUTIFUL AND DELICATE AND PERFECT AND
BLESSED BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF LOVE IS OF ANOTHER NATURE AND IS SUCH AS
I HAVE DESCRIBED
I SAID 'O THOU STRANGER WOMAN THOU SAYEST WELL BUT ASSUMING LOVE TO
BE SUCH AS YOU SAY WHAT IS THE USE OF HIM TO MEN 'THAT SOCRATES
SHE REPLIED 'I WILL ATTEMPT TO UNFOLD OF HIS NATURE AND BIRTH I HAVE
ALREADY SPOKEN AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LOVE IS OF THE BEAUTIFUL
BUT
SOME ONE WILL SAY OF THE BEAUTIFUL IN WHAT SOCRATES AND DIOTIMA OR
RATHER LET ME PUT THE QUESTION MORE CLEARLY AND ASK WHEN A MAN LOVES
THE BEAUTIFUL WHAT DOES HE DESIRE I ANSWERED HER 'THAT THE BEAUTIFUL
MAY BE HIS 'STILL SHE SAID 'THE ANSWER SUGGESTS A FURTHER QUESTION
WHAT IS GIVEN BY THE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY 'TO WHAT YOU HAVE ASKED
I REPLIED 'I HAVE NO ANSWER READY 'THEN SHE SAID 'LET ME PUT THE
WORD GOOD IN THE PLACE OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND REPEAT THE QUESTION ONCE
MORE IF HE WHO LOVES LOVES THE GOOD WHAT IS IT THEN THAT HE LOVES
'THE POSSESSION OF THE GOOD I SAID
'AND WHAT DOES HE GAIN WHO
POSSESSES THE GOOD 'HAPPINESS I REPLIED 'THERE IS LESS DIFFICULTY
IN ANSWERING THAT QUESTION 'YES SHE SAID 'THE HAPPY ARE MADE HAPPY
BY THE ACQUISITION OF GOOD THINGS
NOR IS THERE ANY NEED TO ASK WHY A
MAN DESIRES HAPPINESS THE ANSWER IS ALREADY FINAL 'YOU ARE RIGHT
I SAID
'AND IS THIS WISH AND THIS DESIRE COMMON TO ALL AND DO ALL MEN
ALWAYS DESIRE THEIR OWN GOOD OR ONLY SOME MEN WHAT SAY YOU 'ALL
MEN I REPLIED 'THE DESIRE IS COMMON TO ALL 'WHY THEN SHE
REJOINED 'ARE NOT ALL MEN SOCRATES SAID TO LOVE BUT ONLY SOME OF
THEM WHEREAS YOU SAY THAT ALL MEN ARE ALWAYS LOVING THE SAME THINGS
'I MYSELF WONDER I SAID 'WHY THIS IS 'THERE IS NOTHING TO WONDER
AT SHE REPLIED 'THE REASON IS THAT ONE PART OF LOVE IS SEPARATED
OFF AND RECEIVES THE NAME OF THE WHOLE BUT THE OTHER PARTS HAVE OTHER
NAMES 'GIVE AN ILLUSTRATION I SAID
SHE ANSWERED ME AS FOLLOWS
'THERE IS POETRY WHICH AS YOU KNOW IS COMPLEX AND MANIFOLD
ALL
CREATION OR PASSAGE OF NON BEING INTO BEING IS POETRY OR MAKING AND THE
PROCESSES OF ALL ART ARE CREATIVE AND THE MASTERS OF ARTS ARE ALL POETS
OR MAKERS 'VERY TRUE 'STILL SHE SAID 'YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT
CALLED POETS BUT HAVE OTHER NAMES ONLY THAT PORTION OF THE ART WHICH
IS SEPARATED OFF FROM THE REST AND IS CONCERNED WITH MUSIC AND METRE
IS TERMED POETRY AND THEY WHO POSSESS POETRY IN THIS SENSE OF THE WORD
ARE CALLED POETS 'VERY TRUE I SAID
'AND THE SAME HOLDS OF LOVE
FOR
YOU MAY SAY GENERALLY THAT ALL DESIRE OF GOOD AND HAPPINESS IS ONLY THE
GREAT AND SUBTLE POWER OF LOVE BUT THEY WHO ARE DRAWN TOWARDS HIM
BY ANY OTHER PATH WHETHER THE PATH OF MONEY MAKING OR GYMNASTICS OR
PHILOSOPHY ARE NOT CALLED LOVERS THE NAME OF THE WHOLE IS APPROPRIATED
TO THOSE WHOSE AFFECTION TAKES ONE FORM ONLY THEY ALONE ARE SAID TO
LOVE OR TO BE LOVERS 'I DARE SAY I REPLIED 'THAT YOU ARE RIGHT
'YES SHE ADDED 'AND YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT LOVERS ARE SEEKING FOR
THEIR OTHER HALF BUT I SAY THAT THEY ARE SEEKING NEITHER FOR THE HALF
OF THEMSELVES NOR FOR THE WHOLE UNLESS THE HALF OR THE WHOLE BE ALSO A
GOOD
AND THEY WILL CUT OFF THEIR OWN HANDS AND FEET AND CAST THEM AWAY
IF THEY ARE EVIL FOR THEY LOVE NOT WHAT IS THEIR OWN UNLESS PERCHANCE
THERE BE SOME ONE WHO CALLS WHAT BELONGS TO HIM THE GOOD AND WHAT
BELONGS TO ANOTHER THE EVIL
FOR THERE IS NOTHING WHICH MEN LOVE BUT
THE GOOD
IS THERE ANYTHING 'CERTAINLY I SHOULD SAY THAT THERE IS
NOTHING 'THEN SHE SAID 'THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT MEN LOVE THE
GOOD 'YES I SAID
'TO WHICH MUST BE ADDED THAT THEY LOVE THE
POSSESSION OF THE GOOD 'YES THAT MUST BE ADDED 'AND NOT ONLY THE
POSSESSION BUT THE EVERLASTING POSSESSION OF THE GOOD 'THAT MUST BE
ADDED TOO 'THEN LOVE SHE SAID 'MAY BE DESCRIBED GENERALLY AS THE
LOVE OF THE EVERLASTING POSSESSION OF THE GOOD 'THAT IS MOST TRUE
'THEN IF THIS BE THE NATURE OF LOVE CAN YOU TELL ME FURTHER SHE SAID
'WHAT IS THE MANNER OF THE PURSUIT WHAT ARE THEY DOING WHO SHOW ALL
THIS EAGERNESS AND HEAT WHICH IS CALLED LOVE AND WHAT IS THE OBJECT
WHICH THEY HAVE IN VIEW ANSWER ME 'NAY DIOTIMA I REPLIED 'IF I
HAD KNOWN I SHOULD NOT HAVE WONDERED AT YOUR WISDOM NEITHER SHOULD I
HAVE COME TO LEARN FROM YOU ABOUT THIS VERY MATTER 'WELL SHE SAID
'I WILL TEACH YOU THE OBJECT WHICH THEY HAVE IN VIEW IS BIRTH IN
BEAUTY WHETHER OF BODY OR SOUL 'I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU I SAID
'THE ORACLE REQUIRES AN EXPLANATION 'I WILL MAKE MY MEANING CLEARER
SHE REPLIED
'I MEAN TO SAY THAT ALL MEN ARE BRINGING TO THE BIRTH IN
THEIR BODIES AND IN THEIR SOULS
THERE IS A CERTAIN AGE AT WHICH HUMAN
NATURE IS DESIROUS OF PROCREATION PROCREATION WHICH MUST BE IN BEAUTY
AND NOT IN DEFORMITY AND THIS PROCREATION IS THE UNION OF MAN AND
WOMAN AND IS A DIVINE THING FOR CONCEPTION AND GENERATION ARE AN
IMMORTAL PRINCIPLE IN THE MORTAL CREATURE AND IN THE INHARMONIOUS THEY
CAN NEVER BE
BUT THE DEFORMED IS ALWAYS INHARMONIOUS WITH THE DIVINE
AND THE BEAUTIFUL HARMONIOUS
BEAUTY THEN IS THE DESTINY OR GODDESS
OF PARTURITION WHO PRESIDES AT BIRTH AND THEREFORE WHEN APPROACHING
BEAUTY THE CONCEIVING POWER IS PROPITIOUS AND DIFFUSIVE AND BENIGN
AND BEGETS AND BEARS FRUIT AT THE SIGHT OF UGLINESS SHE FROWNS AND
CONTRACTS AND HAS A SENSE OF PAIN AND TURNS AWAY AND SHRIVELS UP AND
NOT WITHOUT A PANG REFRAINS FROM CONCEPTION
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY
WHEN THE HOUR OF CONCEPTION ARRIVES AND THE TEEMING NATURE IS FULL
THERE IS SUCH A FLUTTER AND ECSTASY ABOUT BEAUTY WHOSE APPROACH IS THE
ALLEVIATION OF THE PAIN OF TRAVAIL
FOR LOVE SOCRATES IS NOT AS YOU
IMAGINE THE LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL ONLY 'WHAT THEN 'THE LOVE OF
GENERATION AND OF BIRTH IN BEAUTY 'YES I SAID
'YES INDEED SHE
REPLIED
'BUT WHY OF GENERATION 'BECAUSE TO THE MORTAL CREATURE
GENERATION IS A SORT OF ETERNITY AND IMMORTALITY SHE REPLIED 'AND IF
AS HAS BEEN ALREADY ADMITTED LOVE IS OF THE EVERLASTING POSSESSION
OF THE GOOD ALL MEN WILL NECESSARILY DESIRE IMMORTALITY TOGETHER WITH
GOOD WHEREFORE LOVE IS OF IMMORTALITY
ALL THIS SHE TAUGHT ME AT VARIOUS TIMES WHEN SHE SPOKE OF LOVE
AND I
REMEMBER HER ONCE SAYING TO ME 'WHAT IS THE CAUSE SOCRATES OF LOVE
AND THE ATTENDANT DESIRE SEE YOU NOT HOW ALL ANIMALS BIRDS AS WELL AS
BEASTS IN THEIR DESIRE OF PROCREATION ARE IN AGONY WHEN THEY TAKE THE
INFECTION OF LOVE WHICH BEGINS WITH THE DESIRE OF UNION WHERETO IS
ADDED THE CARE OF OFFSPRING ON WHOSE BEHALF THE WEAKEST ARE READY TO
BATTLE AGAINST THE STRONGEST EVEN TO THE UTTERMOST AND TO DIE FOR THEM
AND WILL LET THEMSELVES BE TORMENTED WITH HUNGER OR SUFFER ANYTHING
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR YOUNG
MAN MAY BE SUPPOSED TO ACT THUS FROM
REASON BUT WHY SHOULD ANIMALS HAVE THESE PASSIONATE FEELINGS CAN YOU
TELL ME WHY AGAIN I REPLIED THAT I DID NOT KNOW
SHE SAID TO ME 'AND
DO YOU EXPECT EVER TO BECOME A MASTER IN THE ART OF LOVE IF YOU DO NOT
KNOW THIS 'BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY DIOTIMA THAT MY IGNORANCE IS
THE REASON WHY I COME TO YOU FOR I AM CONSCIOUS THAT I WANT A TEACHER
TELL ME THEN THE CAUSE OF THIS AND OF THE OTHER MYSTERIES OF LOVE
'MARVEL NOT SHE SAID 'IF YOU BELIEVE THAT LOVE IS OF THE IMMORTAL
AS WE HAVE SEVERAL TIMES ACKNOWLEDGED FOR HERE AGAIN AND ON THE SAME
PRINCIPLE TOO THE MORTAL NATURE IS SEEKING AS FAR AS IS POSSIBLE TO BE
EVERLASTING AND IMMORTAL AND THIS IS ONLY TO BE ATTAINED BY GENERATION
BECAUSE GENERATION ALWAYS LEAVES BEHIND A NEW EXISTENCE IN THE PLACE OF
THE OLD
NAY EVEN IN THE LIFE OF THE SAME INDIVIDUAL THERE IS SUCCESSION
AND NOT ABSOLUTE UNITY A MAN IS CALLED THE SAME AND YET IN THE SHORT
INTERVAL WHICH ELAPSES BETWEEN YOUTH AND AGE AND IN WHICH EVERY ANIMAL
IS SAID TO HAVE LIFE AND IDENTITY HE IS UNDERGOING A PERPETUAL PROCESS
OF LOSS AND REPARATION HAIR FLESH BONES BLOOD AND THE WHOLE BODY
ARE ALWAYS CHANGING
WHICH IS TRUE NOT ONLY OF THE BODY BUT ALSO OF THE
SOUL WHOSE HABITS TEMPERS OPINIONS DESIRES PLEASURES PAINS FEARS
NEVER REMAIN THE SAME IN ANY ONE OF US BUT ARE ALWAYS COMING AND GOING
AND EQUALLY TRUE OF KNOWLEDGE AND WHAT IS STILL MORE SURPRISING TO US
MORTALS NOT ONLY DO THE SCIENCES IN GENERAL SPRING UP AND DECAY
SO THAT IN RESPECT OF THEM WE ARE NEVER THE SAME BUT EACH OF THEM
INDIVIDUALLY EXPERIENCES A LIKE CHANGE
FOR WHAT IS IMPLIED IN THE WORD
RECOLLECTION BUT THE DEPARTURE OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS EVER BEING
FORGOTTEN AND IS RENEWED AND PRESERVED BY RECOLLECTION AND APPEARS TO
BE THE SAME ALTHOUGH IN REALITY NEW ACCORDING TO THAT LAW OF SUCCESSION
BY WHICH ALL MORTAL THINGS ARE PRESERVED NOT ABSOLUTELY THE SAME BUT
BY SUBSTITUTION THE OLD WORN OUT MORTALITY LEAVING ANOTHER NEW AND
SIMILAR EXISTENCE BEHIND UNLIKE THE DIVINE WHICH IS ALWAYS THE SAME
AND NOT ANOTHER AND IN THIS WAY SOCRATES THE MORTAL BODY OR MORTAL
ANYTHING PARTAKES OF IMMORTALITY BUT THE IMMORTAL IN ANOTHER WAY
MARVEL NOT THEN AT THE LOVE WHICH ALL MEN HAVE OF THEIR OFFSPRING FOR
THAT UNIVERSAL LOVE AND INTEREST IS FOR THE SAKE OF IMMORTALITY
I WAS ASTONISHED AT HER WORDS AND SAID 'IS THIS REALLY TRUE O
THOU WISE DIOTIMA AND SHE ANSWERED WITH ALL THE AUTHORITY OF AN
ACCOMPLISHED SOPHIST 'OF THAT SOCRATES YOU MAY BE ASSURED THINK
ONLY OF THE AMBITION OF MEN AND YOU WILL WONDER AT THE SENSELESSNESS OF
THEIR WAYS UNLESS YOU CONSIDER HOW THEY ARE STIRRED BY THE LOVE OF AN
IMMORTALITY OF FAME
THEY ARE READY TO RUN ALL RISKS GREATER FAR THAN
THEY WOULD HAVE RUN FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND TO SPEND MONEY AND UNDERGO
ANY SORT OF TOIL AND EVEN TO DIE FOR THE SAKE OF LEAVING BEHIND THEM
A NAME WHICH SHALL BE ETERNAL
DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ALCESTIS WOULD HAVE
DIED TO SAVE ADMETUS OR ACHILLES TO AVENGE PATROCLUS OR YOUR OWN
CODRUS IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE KINGDOM FOR HIS SONS IF THEY HAD NOT
IMAGINED THAT THE MEMORY OF THEIR VIRTUES WHICH STILL SURVIVES AMONG
US WOULD BE IMMORTAL NAY SHE SAID 'I AM PERSUADED THAT ALL MEN DO
ALL THINGS AND THE BETTER THEY ARE THE MORE THEY DO THEM IN HOPE OF
THE GLORIOUS FAME OF IMMORTAL VIRTUE FOR THEY DESIRE THE IMMORTAL
'THOSE WHO ARE PREGNANT IN THE BODY ONLY BETAKE THEMSELVES TO WOMEN AND
BEGET CHILDREN THIS IS THE CHARACTER OF THEIR LOVE THEIR OFFSPRING
AS THEY HOPE WILL PRESERVE THEIR MEMORY AND GIVING THEM THE BLESSEDNESS
AND IMMORTALITY WHICH THEY DESIRE IN THE FUTURE
BUT SOULS WHICH ARE
PREGNANT FOR THERE CERTAINLY ARE MEN WHO ARE MORE CREATIVE IN THEIR
SOULS THAN IN THEIR BODIES CONCEIVE THAT WHICH IS PROPER FOR THE SOUL
TO CONCEIVE OR CONTAIN
AND WHAT ARE THESE CONCEPTIONS WISDOM AND
VIRTUE IN GENERAL
AND SUCH CREATORS ARE POETS AND ALL ARTISTS WHO ARE
DESERVING OF THE NAME INVENTOR
BUT THE GREATEST AND FAIREST SORT OF
WISDOM BY FAR IS THAT WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH THE ORDERING OF STATES
AND FAMILIES AND WHICH IS CALLED TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE
AND HE WHO IN
YOUTH HAS THE SEED OF THESE IMPLANTED IN HIM AND IS HIMSELF INSPIRED
WHEN HE COMES TO MATURITY DESIRES TO BEGET AND GENERATE
HE WANDERS
ABOUT SEEKING BEAUTY THAT HE MAY BEGET OFFSPRING FOR IN DEFORMITY HE
WILL BEGET NOTHING AND NATURALLY EMBRACES THE BEAUTIFUL RATHER THAN
THE DEFORMED BODY ABOVE ALL WHEN HE FINDS A FAIR AND NOBLE AND
WELL NURTURED SOUL HE EMBRACES THE TWO IN ONE PERSON AND TO SUCH AN
ONE HE IS FULL OF SPEECH ABOUT VIRTUE AND THE NATURE AND PURSUITS OF A
GOOD MAN AND HE TRIES TO EDUCATE HIM AND AT THE TOUCH OF THE BEAUTIFUL
WHICH IS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MEMORY EVEN WHEN ABSENT HE BRINGS FORTH
THAT WHICH HE HAD CONCEIVED LONG BEFORE AND IN COMPANY WITH HIM TENDS
THAT WHICH HE BRINGS FORTH AND THEY ARE MARRIED BY A FAR NEARER TIE AND
HAVE A CLOSER FRIENDSHIP THAN THOSE WHO BEGET MORTAL CHILDREN FOR THE
CHILDREN WHO ARE THEIR COMMON OFFSPRING ARE FAIRER AND MORE IMMORTAL
WHO WHEN HE THINKS OF HOMER AND HESIOD AND OTHER GREAT POETS WOULD
NOT RATHER HAVE THEIR CHILDREN THAN ORDINARY HUMAN ONES WHO WOULD NOT
EMULATE THEM IN THE CREATION OF CHILDREN SUCH AS THEIRS WHICH HAVE
PRESERVED THEIR MEMORY AND GIVEN THEM EVERLASTING GLORY OR WHO WOULD
NOT HAVE SUCH CHILDREN AS LYCURGUS LEFT BEHIND HIM TO BE THE SAVIOURS
NOT ONLY OF LACEDAEMON BUT OF HELLAS AS ONE MAY SAY THERE IS SOLON
TOO WHO IS THE REVERED FATHER OF ATHENIAN LAWS AND MANY OTHERS THERE
ARE IN MANY OTHER PLACES BOTH AMONG HELLENES AND BARBARIANS WHO HAVE
GIVEN TO THE WORLD MANY NOBLE WORKS AND HAVE BEEN THE PARENTS OF VIRTUE
OF EVERY KIND AND MANY TEMPLES HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THEIR HONOUR FOR THE
SAKE OF CHILDREN SUCH AS THEIRS WHICH WERE NEVER RAISED IN HONOUR OF
ANY ONE FOR THE SAKE OF HIS MORTAL CHILDREN
'THESE ARE THE LESSER MYSTERIES OF LOVE INTO WHICH EVEN YOU SOCRATES
MAY ENTER TO THE GREATER AND MORE HIDDEN ONES WHICH ARE THE CROWN OF
THESE AND TO WHICH IF YOU PURSUE THEM IN A RIGHT SPIRIT THEY WILL
LEAD I KNOW NOT WHETHER YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ATTAIN
BUT I WILL DO MY
UTMOST TO INFORM YOU AND DO YOU FOLLOW IF YOU CAN
FOR HE WHO WOULD
PROCEED ARIGHT IN THIS MATTER SHOULD BEGIN IN YOUTH TO VISIT BEAUTIFUL
FORMS AND FIRST IF HE BE GUIDED BY HIS INSTRUCTOR ARIGHT TO LOVE ONE
SUCH FORM ONLY OUT OF THAT HE SHOULD CREATE FAIR THOUGHTS AND SOON
HE WILL OF HIMSELF PERCEIVE THAT THE BEAUTY OF ONE FORM IS AKIN TO THE
BEAUTY OF ANOTHER AND THEN IF BEAUTY OF FORM IN GENERAL IS HIS PURSUIT
HOW FOOLISH WOULD HE BE NOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE BEAUTY IN EVERY FORM
IS AND THE SAME AND WHEN HE PERCEIVES THIS HE WILL ABATE HIS VIOLENT
LOVE OF THE ONE WHICH HE WILL DESPISE AND DEEM A SMALL THING AND
WILL BECOME A LOVER OF ALL BEAUTIFUL FORMS IN THE NEXT STAGE HE WILL
CONSIDER THAT THE BEAUTY OF THE MIND IS MORE HONOURABLE THAN THE BEAUTY
OF THE OUTWARD FORM
SO THAT IF A VIRTUOUS SOUL HAVE BUT A LITTLE
COMELINESS HE WILL BE CONTENT TO LOVE AND TEND HIM AND WILL SEARCH OUT
AND BRING TO THE BIRTH THOUGHTS WHICH MAY IMPROVE THE YOUNG UNTIL HE
IS COMPELLED TO CONTEMPLATE AND SEE THE BEAUTY OF INSTITUTIONS AND LAWS
AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BEAUTY OF THEM ALL IS OF ONE FAMILY AND THAT
PERSONAL BEAUTY IS A TRIFLE AND AFTER LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS HE WILL
GO ON TO THE SCIENCES THAT HE MAY SEE THEIR BEAUTY BEING NOT LIKE
A SERVANT IN LOVE WITH THE BEAUTY OF ONE YOUTH OR MAN OR INSTITUTION
HIMSELF A SLAVE MEAN AND NARROW MINDED BUT DRAWING TOWARDS AND
CONTEMPLATING THE VAST SEA OF BEAUTY HE WILL CREATE MANY FAIR AND NOBLE
THOUGHTS AND NOTIONS IN BOUNDLESS LOVE OF WISDOM UNTIL ON THAT SHORE HE
GROWS AND WAXES STRONG AND AT LAST THE VISION IS REVEALED TO HIM OF
A SINGLE SCIENCE WHICH IS THE SCIENCE OF BEAUTY EVERYWHERE
TO THIS I
WILL PROCEED PLEASE TO GIVE ME YOUR VERY BEST ATTENTION
'HE WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED THUS FAR IN THE THINGS OF LOVE AND WHO HAS
LEARNED TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL IN DUE ORDER AND SUCCESSION WHEN HE COMES
TOWARD THE END WILL SUDDENLY PERCEIVE A NATURE OF WONDROUS BEAUTY AND
THIS SOCRATES IS THE FINAL CAUSE OF ALL OUR FORMER TOILS A NATURE
WHICH IN THE FIRST PLACE IS EVERLASTING NOT GROWING AND DECAYING OR
WAXING AND WANING SECONDLY NOT FAIR IN ONE POINT OF VIEW AND FOUL
IN ANOTHER OR AT ONE TIME OR IN ONE RELATION OR AT ONE PLACE FAIR AT
ANOTHER TIME OR IN ANOTHER RELATION OR AT ANOTHER PLACE FOUL AS IF FAIR
TO SOME AND FOUL TO OTHERS OR IN THE LIKENESS OF A FACE OR HANDS OR ANY
OTHER PART OF THE BODILY FRAME OR IN ANY FORM OF SPEECH OR KNOWLEDGE
OR EXISTING IN ANY OTHER BEING AS FOR EXAMPLE IN AN ANIMAL OR
IN HEAVEN OR IN EARTH OR IN ANY OTHER PLACE BUT BEAUTY ABSOLUTE
SEPARATE SIMPLE AND EVERLASTING WHICH WITHOUT DIMINUTION AND WITHOUT
INCREASE OR ANY CHANGE IS IMPARTED TO THE EVER GROWING AND PERISHING
BEAUTIES OF ALL OTHER THINGS
HE WHO FROM THESE ASCENDING UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF TRUE LOVE BEGINS TO PERCEIVE THAT BEAUTY IS NOT FAR FROM
THE END
AND THE TRUE ORDER OF GOING OR BEING LED BY ANOTHER TO THE
THINGS OF LOVE IS TO BEGIN FROM THE BEAUTIES OF EARTH AND MOUNT UPWARDS
FOR THE SAKE OF THAT OTHER BEAUTY USING THESE AS STEPS ONLY AND FROM
ONE GOING ON TO TWO AND FROM TWO TO ALL FAIR FORMS AND FROM FAIR FORMS
TO FAIR PRACTICES AND FROM FAIR PRACTICES TO FAIR NOTIONS UNTIL FROM
FAIR NOTIONS HE ARRIVES AT THE NOTION OF ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AND AT LAST
KNOWS WHAT THE ESSENCE OF BEAUTY IS
THIS MY DEAR SOCRATES SAID THE
STRANGER OF MANTINEIA 'IS THAT LIFE ABOVE ALL OTHERS WHICH MAN SHOULD
LIVE IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF BEAUTY ABSOLUTE A BEAUTY WHICH IF YOU
ONCE BEHELD YOU WOULD SEE NOT TO BE AFTER THE MEASURE OF GOLD AND
GARMENTS AND FAIR BOYS AND YOUTHS WHOSE PRESENCE NOW ENTRANCES YOU
AND YOU AND MANY A ONE WOULD BE CONTENT TO LIVE SEEING THEM ONLY AND
CONVERSING WITH THEM WITHOUT MEAT OR DRINK IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE YOU
ONLY WANT TO LOOK AT THEM AND TO BE WITH THEM
BUT WHAT IF MAN HAD EYES
TO SEE THE TRUE BEAUTY THE DIVINE BEAUTY I MEAN PURE AND CLEAR AND
UNALLOYED NOT CLOGGED WITH THE POLLUTIONS OF MORTALITY AND ALL THE
COLOURS AND VANITIES OF HUMAN LIFE THITHER LOOKING AND HOLDING
CONVERSE WITH THE TRUE BEAUTY SIMPLE AND DIVINE REMEMBER HOW IN THAT
COMMUNION ONLY BEHOLDING BEAUTY WITH THE EYE OF THE MIND HE WILL BE
ENABLED TO BRING FORTH NOT IMAGES OF BEAUTY BUT REALITIES FOR HE
HAS HOLD NOT OF AN IMAGE BUT OF A REALITY AND BRINGING FORTH AND
NOURISHING TRUE VIRTUE TO BECOME THE FRIEND OF GOD AND BE IMMORTAL IF
MORTAL MAN MAY
WOULD THAT BE AN IGNOBLE LIFE
SUCH PHAEDRUS AND I SPEAK NOT ONLY TO YOU BUT TO ALL OF YOU WERE THE
WORDS OF DIOTIMA AND I AM PERSUADED OF THEIR TRUTH
AND BEING PERSUADED
OF THEM I TRY TO PERSUADE OTHERS THAT IN THE ATTAINMENT OF THIS
END HUMAN NATURE WILL NOT EASILY FIND A HELPER BETTER THAN LOVE AND
THEREFORE ALSO I SAY THAT EVERY MAN OUGHT TO HONOUR HIM AS I MYSELF
HONOUR HIM AND WALK IN HIS WAYS AND EXHORT OTHERS TO DO THE SAME
AND PRAISE THE POWER AND SPIRIT OF LOVE ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE OF MY
ABILITY NOW AND EVER
THE WORDS WHICH I HAVE SPOKEN YOU PHAEDRUS MAY CALL AN ENCOMIUM OF
LOVE OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH YOU PLEASE
WHEN SOCRATES HAD DONE SPEAKING THE COMPANY APPLAUDED AND ARISTOPHANES
WAS BEGINNING TO SAY SOMETHING IN ANSWER TO THE ALLUSION WHICH SOCRATES
HAD MADE TO HIS OWN SPEECH WHEN SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT KNOCKING AT
THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AS OF REVELLERS AND THE SOUND OF A FLUTE GIRL
WAS HEARD
AGATHON TOLD THE ATTENDANTS TO GO AND SEE WHO WERE THE
INTRUDERS
'IF THEY ARE FRIENDS OF OURS HE SAID 'INVITE THEM IN BUT
IF NOT SAY THAT THE DRINKING IS OVER A LITTLE WHILE AFTERWARDS THEY
HEARD THE VOICE OF ALCIBIADES RESOUNDING IN THE COURT HE WAS IN A GREAT
STATE OF INTOXICATION AND KEPT ROARING AND SHOUTING 'WHERE IS AGATHON
LEAD ME TO AGATHON AND AT LENGTH SUPPORTED BY THE FLUTE GIRL AND SOME
OF HIS ATTENDANTS HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THEM
'HAIL FRIENDS HE SAID
APPEARING AT THE DOOR CROWNED WITH A MASSIVE GARLAND OF IVY AND VIOLETS
HIS HEAD FLOWING WITH RIBANDS
'WILL YOU HAVE A VERY DRUNKEN MAN AS
A COMPANION OF YOUR REVELS OR SHALL I CROWN AGATHON WHICH WAS MY
INTENTION IN COMING AND GO AWAY FOR I WAS UNABLE TO COME YESTERDAY
AND THEREFORE I AM HERE TO DAY CARRYING ON MY HEAD THESE RIBANDS THAT
TAKING THEM FROM MY OWN HEAD I MAY CROWN THE HEAD OF THIS FAIREST AND
WISEST OF MEN AS I MAY BE ALLOWED TO CALL HIM
WILL YOU LAUGH AT ME
BECAUSE I AM DRUNK YET I KNOW VERY WELL THAT I AM SPEAKING THE TRUTH
ALTHOUGH YOU MAY LAUGH
BUT FIRST TELL ME IF I COME IN SHALL WE HAVE
THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH I SPOKE SUPRA WILL YOU HAVE A VERY DRUNKEN
MAN ETC WILL YOU DRINK WITH ME OR NOT
THE COMPANY WERE VOCIFEROUS IN BEGGING THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
AMONG THEM AND AGATHON SPECIALLY INVITED HIM
THEREUPON HE WAS LED IN
BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM AND AS HE WAS BEING LED INTENDING TO
CROWN AGATHON HE TOOK THE RIBANDS FROM HIS OWN HEAD AND HELD THEM IN
FRONT OF HIS EYES HE WAS THUS PREVENTED FROM SEEING SOCRATES WHO MADE
WAY FOR HIM AND ALCIBIADES TOOK THE VACANT PLACE BETWEEN AGATHON AND
SOCRATES AND IN TAKING THE PLACE HE EMBRACED AGATHON AND CROWNED HIM
TAKE OFF HIS SANDALS SAID AGATHON AND LET HIM MAKE A THIRD ON THE SAME
COUCH
BY ALL MEANS BUT WHO MAKES THE THIRD PARTNER IN OUR REVELS SAID
ALCIBIADES TURNING ROUND AND STARTING UP AS HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF
SOCRATES
BY HERACLES HE SAID WHAT IS THIS HERE IS SOCRATES ALWAYS
LYING IN WAIT FOR ME AND ALWAYS AS HIS WAY IS COMING OUT AT ALL SORTS
OF UNSUSPECTED PLACES AND NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY FOR YOURSELF AND
WHY ARE YOU LYING HERE WHERE I PERCEIVE THAT YOU HAVE CONTRIVED TO FIND
A PLACE NOT BY A JOKER OR LOVER OF JOKES LIKE ARISTOPHANES BUT BY THE
FAIREST OF THE COMPANY
SOCRATES TURNED TO AGATHON AND SAID I MUST ASK YOU TO PROTECT ME
AGATHON FOR THE PASSION OF THIS MAN HAS GROWN QUITE A SERIOUS MATTER TO
ME
SINCE I BECAME HIS ADMIRER I HAVE NEVER BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO
ANY OTHER FAIR ONE OR SO MUCH AS TO LOOK AT THEM
IF I DO HE GOES WILD
WITH ENVY AND JEALOUSY AND NOT ONLY ABUSES ME BUT CAN HARDLY KEEP HIS
HANDS OFF ME AND AT THIS MOMENT HE MAY DO ME SOME HARM
PLEASE TO SEE
TO THIS AND EITHER RECONCILE ME TO HIM OR IF HE ATTEMPTS VIOLENCE
PROTECT ME AS I AM IN BODILY FEAR OF HIS MAD AND PASSIONATE ATTEMPTS
THERE CAN NEVER BE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN YOU AND ME SAID ALCIBIADES
BUT FOR THE PRESENT I WILL DEFER YOUR CHASTISEMENT
AND I MUST BEG
YOU AGATHON TO GIVE ME BACK SOME OF THE RIBANDS THAT I MAY CROWN THE
MARVELLOUS HEAD OF THIS UNIVERSAL DESPOT I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM COMPLAIN
OF ME FOR CROWNING YOU AND NEGLECTING HIM WHO IN CONVERSATION IS THE
CONQUEROR OF ALL MANKIND AND THIS NOT ONLY ONCE AS YOU WERE THE DAY
BEFORE YESTERDAY BUT ALWAYS
WHEREUPON TAKING SOME OF THE RIBANDS HE
CROWNED SOCRATES AND AGAIN RECLINED
THEN HE SAID YOU SEEM MY FRIENDS TO BE SOBER WHICH IS A THING NOT TO
BE ENDURED YOU MUST DRINK FOR THAT WAS THE AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH I
WAS ADMITTED AND I ELECT MYSELF MASTER OF THE FEAST UNTIL YOU ARE
WELL DRUNK
LET US HAVE A LARGE GOBLET AGATHON OR RATHER HE SAID
ADDRESSING THE ATTENDANT BRING ME THAT WINE COOLER
THE WINE COOLER
WHICH HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE WAS A VESSEL HOLDING MORE THAN TWO QUARTS THIS
HE FILLED AND EMPTIED AND BADE THE ATTENDANT FILL IT AGAIN FOR
SOCRATES
OBSERVE MY FRIENDS SAID ALCIBIADES THAT THIS INGENIOUS
TRICK OF MINE WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON SOCRATES FOR HE CAN DRINK ANY
QUANTITY OF WINE AND NOT BE AT ALL NEARER BEING DRUNK
SOCRATES DRANK
THE CUP WHICH THE ATTENDANT FILLED FOR HIM
ERYXIMACHUS SAID WHAT IS THIS ALCIBIADES ARE WE TO HAVE NEITHER
CONVERSATION NOR SINGING OVER OUR CUPS BUT SIMPLY TO DRINK AS IF WE
WERE THIRSTY
ALCIBIADES REPLIED HAIL WORTHY SON OF A MOST WISE AND WORTHY SIRE
THE SAME TO YOU SAID ERYXIMACHUS BUT WHAT SHALL WE DO
THAT I LEAVE TO YOU SAID ALCIBIADES
'THE WISE PHYSICIAN SKILLED OUR WOUNDS TO HEAL FROM POPE'S HOMER IL
SHALL PRESCRIBE AND WE WILL OBEY
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WELL SAID ERYXIMACHUS BEFORE YOU APPEARED WE HAD PASSED A RESOLUTION
THAT EACH ONE OF US IN TURN SHOULD MAKE A SPEECH IN PRAISE OF LOVE AND
AS GOOD A ONE AS HE COULD THE TURN WAS PASSED ROUND FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
AND AS ALL OF US HAVE SPOKEN AND YOU HAVE NOT SPOKEN BUT HAVE WELL
DRUNKEN YOU OUGHT TO SPEAK AND THEN IMPOSE UPON SOCRATES ANY TASK
WHICH YOU PLEASE AND HE ON HIS RIGHT HAND NEIGHBOUR AND SO ON
THAT IS GOOD ERYXIMACHUS SAID ALCIBIADES AND YET THE COMPARISON OF
A DRUNKEN MAN'S SPEECH WITH THOSE OF SOBER MEN IS HARDLY FAIR AND
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW SWEET FRIEND WHETHER YOU REALLY BELIEVE WHAT
SOCRATES WAS JUST NOW SAYING FOR I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE VERY REVERSE
IS THE FACT AND THAT IF I PRAISE ANY ONE BUT HIMSELF IN HIS PRESENCE
WHETHER GOD OR MAN HE WILL HARDLY KEEP HIS HANDS OFF ME
FOR SHAME SAID SOCRATES
HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID ALCIBIADES FOR BY POSEIDON THERE IS NO ONE ELSE
WHOM I WILL PRAISE WHEN YOU ARE OF THE COMPANY
WELL THEN SAID ERYXIMACHUS IF YOU LIKE PRAISE SOCRATES
WHAT DO YOU THINK ERYXIMACHUS SAID ALCIBIADES SHALL I ATTACK HIM AND
INFLICT THE PUNISHMENT BEFORE YOU ALL
WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT SAID SOCRATES ARE YOU GOING TO RAISE A LAUGH AT MY
EXPENSE IS THAT THE MEANING OF YOUR PRAISE
I AM GOING TO SPEAK THE TRUTH IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME
I NOT ONLY PERMIT BUT EXHORT YOU TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
THEN I WILL BEGIN AT ONCE SAID ALCIBIADES AND IF I SAY ANYTHING WHICH
IS NOT TRUE YOU MAY INTERRUPT ME IF YOU WILL AND SAY 'THAT IS A LIE
THOUGH MY INTENTION IS TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
BUT YOU MUST NOT WONDER IF
I SPEAK ANY HOW AS THINGS COME INTO MY MIND FOR THE FLUENT AND ORDERLY
ENUMERATION OF ALL YOUR SINGULARITIES IS NOT A TASK WHICH IS EASY TO A
MAN IN MY CONDITION
AND NOW MY BOYS I SHALL PRAISE SOCRATES IN A FIGURE WHICH WILL APPEAR
TO HIM TO BE A CARICATURE AND YET I SPEAK NOT TO MAKE FUN OF HIM BUT
ONLY FOR THE TRUTH'S SAKE
I SAY THAT HE IS EXACTLY LIKE THE BUSTS OF
SILENUS WHICH ARE SET UP IN THE STATUARIES' SHOPS HOLDING PIPES AND
FLUTES IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE MADE TO OPEN IN THE MIDDLE AND
HAVE IMAGES OF GODS INSIDE THEM
I SAY ALSO THAT HE IS LIKE MARSYAS THE
SATYR
YOU YOURSELF WILL NOT DENY SOCRATES THAT YOUR FACE IS LIKE THAT
OF A SATYR
AYE AND THERE IS A RESEMBLANCE IN OTHER POINTS TOO
FOR
EXAMPLE YOU ARE A BULLY AS I CAN PROVE BY WITNESSES IF YOU WILL NOT
CONFESS
AND ARE YOU NOT A FLUTE PLAYER THAT YOU ARE AND A PERFORMER
FAR MORE WONDERFUL THAN MARSYAS
HE INDEED WITH INSTRUMENTS USED TO
CHARM THE SOULS OF MEN BY THE POWER OF HIS BREATH AND THE PLAYERS OF
HIS MUSIC DO SO STILL FOR THE MELODIES OF OLYMPUS COMPARE ARIST
POL
ARE DERIVED FROM MARSYAS WHO TAUGHT THEM AND THESE WHETHER THEY ARE
PLAYED BY A GREAT MASTER OR BY A MISERABLE FLUTE GIRL HAVE A POWER
WHICH NO OTHERS HAVE THEY ALONE POSSESS THE SOUL AND REVEAL THE WANTS
OF THOSE WHO HAVE NEED OF GODS AND MYSTERIES BECAUSE THEY ARE DIVINE
BUT YOU PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT WITH YOUR WORDS ONLY AND DO NOT REQUIRE
THE FLUTE THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND HIM
WHEN WE HEAR ANY
OTHER SPEAKER EVEN A VERY GOOD ONE HE PRODUCES ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT
UPON US OR NOT MUCH WHEREAS THE MERE FRAGMENTS OF YOU AND YOUR WORDS
EVEN AT SECOND HAND AND HOWEVER IMPERFECTLY REPEATED AMAZE AND POSSESS
THE SOULS OF EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD WHO COMES WITHIN HEARING OF
THEM
AND IF I WERE NOT AFRAID THAT YOU WOULD THINK ME HOPELESSLY DRUNK
I WOULD HAVE SWORN AS WELL AS SPOKEN TO THE INFLUENCE WHICH THEY HAVE
ALWAYS HAD AND STILL HAVE OVER ME
FOR MY HEART LEAPS WITHIN ME MORE
THAN THAT OF ANY CORYBANTIAN REVELLER AND MY EYES RAIN TEARS WHEN
I HEAR THEM
AND I OBSERVE THAT MANY OTHERS ARE AFFECTED IN THE SAME
MANNER
I HAVE HEARD PERICLES AND OTHER GREAT ORATORS AND I THOUGHT
THAT THEY SPOKE WELL BUT I NEVER HAD ANY SIMILAR FEELING MY SOUL WAS
NOT STIRRED BY THEM NOR WAS I ANGRY AT THE THOUGHT OF MY OWN SLAVISH
STATE
BUT THIS MARSYAS HAS OFTEN BROUGHT ME TO SUCH A PASS THAT I
HAVE FELT AS IF I COULD HARDLY ENDURE THE LIFE WHICH I AM LEADING THIS
SOCRATES YOU WILL ADMIT AND I AM CONSCIOUS THAT IF I DID NOT SHUT MY
EARS AGAINST HIM AND FLY AS FROM THE VOICE OF THE SIREN MY FATE WOULD
BE LIKE THAT OF OTHERS HE WOULD TRANSFIX ME AND I SHOULD GROW OLD
SITTING AT HIS FEET
FOR HE MAKES ME CONFESS THAT I OUGHT NOT TO LIVE AS
I DO NEGLECTING THE WANTS OF MY OWN SOUL AND BUSYING MYSELF WITH THE
CONCERNS OF THE ATHENIANS THEREFORE I HOLD MY EARS AND TEAR MYSELF AWAY
FROM HIM
AND HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO EVER MADE ME ASHAMED WHICH YOU
MIGHT THINK NOT TO BE IN MY NATURE AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO DOES
THE SAME
FOR I KNOW THAT I CANNOT ANSWER HIM OR SAY THAT I OUGHT NOT TO
DO AS HE BIDS BUT WHEN I LEAVE HIS PRESENCE THE LOVE OF POPULARITY GETS
THE BETTER OF ME
AND THEREFORE I RUN AWAY AND FLY FROM HIM AND WHEN I
SEE HIM I AM ASHAMED OF WHAT I HAVE CONFESSED TO HIM
MANY A TIME HAVE
I WISHED THAT HE WERE DEAD AND YET I KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE MUCH MORE
SORRY THAN GLAD IF HE WERE TO DIE SO THAT I AM AT MY WIT'S END
AND THIS IS WHAT I AND MANY OTHERS HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE FLUTE PLAYING
OF THIS SATYR
YET HEAR ME ONCE MORE WHILE I SHOW YOU HOW EXACT THE
IMAGE IS AND HOW MARVELLOUS HIS POWER
FOR LET ME TELL YOU NONE OF YOU
KNOW HIM BUT I WILL REVEAL HIM TO YOU HAVING BEGUN I MUST GO ON
SEE
YOU HOW FOND HE IS OF THE FAIR HE IS ALWAYS WITH THEM AND IS ALWAYS
BEING SMITTEN BY THEM AND THEN AGAIN HE KNOWS NOTHING AND IS IGNORANT
OF ALL THINGS SUCH IS THE APPEARANCE WHICH HE PUTS ON
IS HE NOT LIKE A
SILENUS IN THIS TO BE SURE HE IS HIS OUTER MASK IS THE CARVED HEAD
OF THE SILENUS BUT O MY COMPANIONS IN DRINK WHEN HE IS OPENED WHAT
TEMPERANCE THERE IS RESIDING WITHIN KNOW YOU THAT BEAUTY AND WEALTH AND
HONOUR AT WHICH THE MANY WONDER ARE OF NO ACCOUNT WITH HIM AND ARE
UTTERLY DESPISED BY HIM HE REGARDS NOT AT ALL THE PERSONS WHO ARE
GIFTED WITH THEM MANKIND ARE NOTHING TO HIM ALL HIS LIFE IS SPENT IN
MOCKING AND FLOUTING AT THEM
BUT WHEN I OPENED HIM AND LOOKED WITHIN
AT HIS SERIOUS PURPOSE I SAW IN HIM DIVINE AND GOLDEN IMAGES OF SUCH
FASCINATING BEAUTY THAT I WAS READY TO DO IN A MOMENT WHATEVER SOCRATES
COMMANDED THEY MAY HAVE ESCAPED THE OBSERVATION OF OTHERS BUT I SAW
THEM
NOW I FANCIED THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY ENAMOURED OF MY BEAUTY AND I
THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD THEREFORE HAVE A GRAND OPPORTUNITY OF HEARING HIM
TELL WHAT HE KNEW FOR I HAD A WONDERFUL OPINION OF THE ATTRACTIONS OF
MY YOUTH
IN THE PROSECUTION OF THIS DESIGN WHEN I NEXT WENT TO HIM I
SENT AWAY THE ATTENDANT WHO USUALLY ACCOMPANIED ME I WILL CONFESS THE
WHOLE TRUTH AND BEG YOU TO LISTEN AND IF I SPEAK FALSELY DO YOU
SOCRATES EXPOSE THE FALSEHOOD
WELL HE AND I WERE ALONE TOGETHER AND
I THOUGHT THAT WHEN THERE WAS NOBODY WITH US I SHOULD HEAR HIM
SPEAK THE LANGUAGE WHICH LOVERS USE TO THEIR LOVES WHEN THEY ARE BY
THEMSELVES AND I WAS DELIGHTED
NOTHING OF THE SORT HE CONVERSED
AS USUAL AND SPENT THE DAY WITH ME AND THEN WENT AWAY
AFTERWARDS I
CHALLENGED HIM TO THE PALAESTRA AND HE WRESTLED AND CLOSED WITH ME
SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE PRESENT I FANCIED THAT I MIGHT
SUCCEED IN THIS MANNER
NOT A BIT I MADE NO WAY WITH HIM
LASTLY AS
I HAD FAILED HITHERTO I THOUGHT THAT I MUST TAKE STRONGER MEASURES AND
ATTACK HIM BOLDLY AND AS I HAD BEGUN NOT GIVE HIM UP BUT SEE HOW
MATTERS STOOD BETWEEN HIM AND ME
SO I INVITED HIM TO SUP WITH ME JUST
AS IF HE WERE A FAIR YOUTH AND I A DESIGNING LOVER
HE WAS NOT EASILY
PERSUADED TO COME HE DID HOWEVER AFTER A WHILE ACCEPT THE INVITATION
AND WHEN HE CAME THE FIRST TIME HE WANTED TO GO AWAY AT ONCE AS SOON AS
SUPPER WAS OVER AND I HAD NOT THE FACE TO DETAIN HIM
THE SECOND
TIME STILL IN PURSUANCE OF MY DESIGN AFTER WE HAD SUPPED I WENT
ON CONVERSING FAR INTO THE NIGHT AND WHEN HE WANTED TO GO AWAY I
PRETENDED THAT THE HOUR WAS LATE AND THAT HE HAD MUCH BETTER REMAIN
SO
HE LAY DOWN ON THE COUCH NEXT TO ME THE SAME ON WHICH HE HAD SUPPED
AND THERE WAS NO ONE BUT OURSELVES SLEEPING IN THE APARTMENT
ALL THIS
MAY BE TOLD WITHOUT SHAME TO ANY ONE
BUT WHAT FOLLOWS I COULD HARDLY
TELL YOU IF I WERE SOBER
YET AS THE PROVERB SAYS 'IN VINO VERITAS
WHETHER WITH BOYS OR WITHOUT THEM IN ALLUSION TO TWO PROVERBS AND
THEREFORE I MUST SPEAK
NOR AGAIN SHOULD I BE JUSTIFIED IN CONCEALING
THE LOFTY ACTIONS OF SOCRATES WHEN I COME TO PRAISE HIM
MOREOVER I
HAVE FELT THE SERPENT'S STING AND HE WHO HAS SUFFERED AS THEY SAY IS
WILLING TO TELL HIS FELLOW SUFFERERS ONLY AS THEY ALONE WILL BE LIKELY
TO UNDERSTAND HIM AND WILL NOT BE EXTREME IN JUDGING OF THE SAYINGS OR
DOINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN WRUNG FROM HIS AGONY
FOR I HAVE BEEN BITTEN BY A
MORE THAN VIPER'S TOOTH I HAVE KNOWN IN MY SOUL OR IN MY HEART OR IN
SOME OTHER PART THAT WORST OF PANGS MORE VIOLENT IN INGENUOUS YOUTH
THAN ANY SERPENT'S TOOTH THE PANG OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH WILL MAKE A MAN
SAY OR DO ANYTHING
AND YOU WHOM I SEE AROUND ME PHAEDRUS AND AGATHON
AND ERYXIMACHUS AND PAUSANIAS AND ARISTODEMUS AND ARISTOPHANES ALL OF
YOU AND I NEED NOT SAY SOCRATES HIMSELF HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE OF THE
SAME MADNESS AND PASSION IN YOUR LONGING AFTER WISDOM
THEREFORE LISTEN
AND EXCUSE MY DOINGS THEN AND MY SAYINGS NOW
BUT LET THE ATTENDANTS AND
OTHER PROFANE AND UNMANNERED PERSONS CLOSE UP THE DOORS OF THEIR EARS
WHEN THE LAMP WAS PUT OUT AND THE SERVANTS HAD GONE AWAY I THOUGHT THAT
I MUST BE PLAIN WITH HIM AND HAVE NO MORE AMBIGUITY
SO I GAVE HIM A
SHAKE AND I SAID 'SOCRATES ARE YOU ASLEEP 'NO HE SAID
'DO
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM MEDITATING 'WHAT ARE YOU MEDITATING HE SAID
'I
THINK I REPLIED 'THAT OF ALL THE LOVERS WHOM I HAVE EVER HAD YOU ARE
THE ONLY ONE WHO IS WORTHY OF ME AND YOU APPEAR TO BE TOO MODEST TO
SPEAK
NOW I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE A FOOL TO REFUSE YOU THIS OR ANY
OTHER FAVOUR AND THEREFORE I COME TO LAY AT YOUR FEET ALL THAT I HAVE
AND ALL THAT MY FRIENDS HAVE IN THE HOPE THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME IN THE
WAY OF VIRTUE WHICH I DESIRE ABOVE ALL THINGS AND IN WHICH I BELIEVE
THAT YOU CAN HELP ME BETTER THAN ANY ONE ELSE
AND I SHOULD CERTAINLY
HAVE MORE REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF WHAT WISE MEN WOULD SAY IF I WERE TO
REFUSE A FAVOUR TO SUCH AS YOU THAN OF WHAT THE WORLD WHO ARE MOSTLY
FOOLS WOULD SAY OF ME IF I GRANTED IT TO THESE WORDS HE REPLIED IN
THE IRONICAL MANNER WHICH IS SO CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM 'ALCIBIADES MY
FRIEND YOU HAVE INDEED AN ELEVATED AIM IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE AND IF
THERE REALLY IS IN ME ANY POWER BY WHICH YOU MAY BECOME BETTER TRULY
YOU MUST SEE IN ME SOME RARE BEAUTY OF A KIND INFINITELY HIGHER THAN ANY
WHICH I SEE IN YOU
AND THEREFORE IF YOU MEAN TO SHARE WITH ME AND TO
EXCHANGE BEAUTY FOR BEAUTY YOU WILL HAVE GREATLY THE ADVANTAGE OF ME
YOU WILL GAIN TRUE BEAUTY IN RETURN FOR APPEARANCE LIKE DIOMEDE GOLD
IN EXCHANGE FOR BRASS
BUT LOOK AGAIN SWEET FRIEND AND SEE WHETHER YOU
ARE NOT DECEIVED IN ME
THE MIND BEGINS TO GROW CRITICAL WHEN THE BODILY
EYE FAILS AND IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU GET OLD HEARING THIS
I SAID 'I HAVE TOLD YOU MY PURPOSE WHICH IS QUITE SERIOUS AND DO YOU
CONSIDER WHAT YOU THINK BEST FOR YOU AND ME 'THAT IS GOOD HE SAID
'AT SOME OTHER TIME THEN WE WILL CONSIDER AND ACT AS SEEMS BEST ABOUT
THIS AND ABOUT OTHER MATTERS WHEREUPON I FANCIED THAT HE WAS SMITTEN
AND THAT THE WORDS WHICH I HAD UTTERED LIKE ARROWS HAD WOUNDED HIM AND
SO WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR MORE I GOT UP AND THROWING MY COAT ABOUT HIM
CREPT UNDER HIS THREADBARE CLOAK AS THE TIME OF YEAR WAS WINTER AND
THERE I LAY DURING THE WHOLE NIGHT HAVING THIS WONDERFUL MONSTER IN
MY ARMS
THIS AGAIN SOCRATES WILL NOT BE DENIED BY YOU
AND YET
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL HE WAS SO SUPERIOR TO MY SOLICITATIONS SO
CONTEMPTUOUS AND DERISIVE AND DISDAINFUL OF MY BEAUTY WHICH REALLY AS
I FANCIED HAD SOME ATTRACTIONS HEAR O JUDGES FOR JUDGES YOU SHALL
BE OF THE HAUGHTY VIRTUE OF SOCRATES NOTHING MORE HAPPENED BUT IN THE
MORNING WHEN I AWOKE LET ALL THE GODS AND GODDESSES BE MY WITNESSES I
AROSE AS FROM THE COUCH OF A FATHER OR AN ELDER BROTHER
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE MUST HAVE BEEN MY FEELINGS AFTER THIS REJECTION AT
THE THOUGHT OF MY OWN DISHONOUR AND YET I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING
AT HIS NATURAL TEMPERANCE AND SELF RESTRAINT AND MANLINESS
I NEVER
IMAGINED THAT I COULD HAVE MET WITH A MAN SUCH AS HE IS IN WISDOM AND
ENDURANCE
AND THEREFORE I COULD NOT BE ANGRY WITH HIM OR RENOUNCE HIS
COMPANY ANY MORE THAN I COULD HOPE TO WIN HIM
FOR I WELL KNEW THAT IF
AJAX COULD NOT BE WOUNDED BY STEEL MUCH LESS HE BY MONEY AND MY ONLY
CHANCE OF CAPTIVATING HIM BY MY PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS HAD FAILED
SO
I WAS AT MY WIT'S END NO ONE WAS EVER MORE HOPELESSLY ENSLAVED BY
ANOTHER
ALL THIS HAPPENED BEFORE HE AND I WENT ON THE EXPEDITION
TO POTIDAEA THERE WE MESSED TOGETHER AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF
OBSERVING HIS EXTRAORDINARY POWER OF SUSTAINING FATIGUE
HIS ENDURANCE
WAS SIMPLY MARVELLOUS WHEN BEING CUT OFF FROM OUR SUPPLIES WE WERE
COMPELLED TO GO WITHOUT FOOD ON SUCH OCCASIONS WHICH OFTEN HAPPEN IN
TIME OF WAR HE WAS SUPERIOR NOT ONLY TO ME BUT TO EVERYBODY THERE WAS
NO ONE TO BE COMPARED TO HIM
YET AT A FESTIVAL HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON
WHO HAD ANY REAL POWERS OF ENJOYMENT THOUGH NOT WILLING TO DRINK HE
COULD IF COMPELLED BEAT US ALL AT THAT WONDERFUL TO RELATE NO
HUMAN BEING HAD EVER SEEN SOCRATES DRUNK AND HIS POWERS IF I AM NOT
MISTAKEN WILL BE TESTED BEFORE LONG
HIS FORTITUDE IN ENDURING COLD WAS
ALSO SURPRISING
THERE WAS A SEVERE FROST FOR THE WINTER IN THAT REGION
IS REALLY TREMENDOUS AND EVERYBODY ELSE EITHER REMAINED INDOORS OR IF
THEY WENT OUT HAD ON AN AMAZING QUANTITY OF CLOTHES AND WERE WELL SHOD
AND HAD THEIR FEET SWATHED IN FELT AND FLEECES IN THE MIDST OF THIS
SOCRATES WITH HIS BARE FEET ON THE ICE AND IN HIS ORDINARY DRESS MARCHED
BETTER THAN THE OTHER SOLDIERS WHO HAD SHOES AND THEY LOOKED DAGGERS AT
HIM BECAUSE HE SEEMED TO DESPISE THEM
I HAVE TOLD YOU ONE TALE AND NOW I MUST TELL YOU ANOTHER WHICH IS
WORTH HEARING
'OF THE DOINGS AND SUFFERINGS OF THE ENDURING MAN'
WHILE HE WAS ON THE EXPEDITION
ONE MORNING HE WAS THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING WHICH HE COULD NOT RESOLVE HE WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP BUT
CONTINUED THINKING FROM EARLY DAWN UNTIL NOON THERE HE STOOD FIXED
IN THOUGHT AND AT NOON ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO HIM AND THE RUMOUR RAN
THROUGH THE WONDERING CROWD THAT SOCRATES HAD BEEN STANDING AND THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING EVER SINCE THE BREAK OF DAY
AT LAST IN THE EVENING
AFTER SUPPER SOME IONIANS OUT OF CURIOSITY I SHOULD EXPLAIN THAT THIS
WAS NOT IN WINTER BUT IN SUMMER BROUGHT OUT THEIR MATS AND SLEPT IN
THE OPEN AIR THAT THEY MIGHT WATCH HIM AND SEE WHETHER HE WOULD STAND
ALL NIGHT
THERE HE STOOD UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND WITH THE
RETURN OF LIGHT HE OFFERED UP A PRAYER TO THE SUN AND WENT HIS WAY
COMPARE SUPRA
I WILL ALSO TELL IF YOU PLEASE AND INDEED I AM BOUND
TO TELL OF HIS COURAGE IN BATTLE FOR WHO BUT HE SAVED MY LIFE NOW
THIS WAS THE ENGAGEMENT IN WHICH I RECEIVED THE PRIZE OF VALOUR FOR I
WAS WOUNDED AND HE WOULD NOT LEAVE ME BUT HE RESCUED ME AND MY ARMS
AND HE OUGHT TO HAVE RECEIVED THE PRIZE OF VALOUR WHICH THE GENERALS
WANTED TO CONFER ON ME PARTLY ON ACCOUNT OF MY RANK AND I TOLD THEM SO
THIS AGAIN SOCRATES WILL NOT IMPEACH OR DENY BUT HE WAS MORE EAGER
THAN THE GENERALS THAT I AND NOT HE SHOULD HAVE THE PRIZE
THERE WAS
ANOTHER OCCASION ON WHICH HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS VERY REMARKABLE IN THE
FLIGHT OF THE ARMY AFTER THE BATTLE OF DELIUM WHERE HE SERVED AMONG THE
HEAVY ARMED I HAD A BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING HIM THAN AT POTIDAEA
FOR I WAS MYSELF ON HORSEBACK AND THEREFORE COMPARATIVELY OUT OF
DANGER
HE AND LACHES WERE RETREATING FOR THE TROOPS WERE IN FLIGHT
AND I MET THEM AND TOLD THEM NOT TO BE DISCOURAGED AND PROMISED TO
REMAIN WITH THEM AND THERE YOU MIGHT SEE HIM ARISTOPHANES AS YOU
DESCRIBE ARISTOPH
CLOUDS JUST AS HE IS IN THE STREETS OF ATHENS
STALKING LIKE A PELICAN AND ROLLING HIS EYES CALMLY CONTEMPLATING
ENEMIES AS WELL AS FRIENDS AND MAKING VERY INTELLIGIBLE TO ANYBODY
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE THAT WHOEVER ATTACKED HIM WOULD BE LIKELY TO
MEET WITH A STOUT RESISTANCE AND IN THIS WAY HE AND HIS COMPANION
ESCAPED FOR THIS IS THE SORT OF MAN WHO IS NEVER TOUCHED IN WAR THOSE
ONLY ARE PURSUED WHO ARE RUNNING AWAY HEADLONG
I PARTICULARLY OBSERVED
HOW SUPERIOR HE WAS TO LACHES IN PRESENCE OF MIND
MANY ARE THE MARVELS
WHICH I MIGHT NARRATE IN PRAISE OF SOCRATES MOST OF HIS WAYS MIGHT
PERHAPS BE PARALLELED IN ANOTHER MAN BUT HIS ABSOLUTE UNLIKENESS TO ANY
HUMAN BEING THAT IS OR EVER HAS BEEN IS PERFECTLY ASTONISHING
YOU
MAY IMAGINE BRASIDAS AND OTHERS TO HAVE BEEN LIKE ACHILLES OR YOU MAY
IMAGINE NESTOR AND ANTENOR TO HAVE BEEN LIKE PERICLES AND THE SAME MAY
BE SAID OF OTHER FAMOUS MEN BUT OF THIS STRANGE BEING YOU WILL NEVER BE
ABLE TO FIND ANY LIKENESS HOWEVER REMOTE EITHER AMONG MEN WHO NOW ARE
OR WHO EVER HAVE BEEN OTHER THAN THAT WHICH I HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED OF
SILENUS AND THE SATYRS AND THEY REPRESENT IN A FIGURE NOT ONLY HIMSELF
BUT HIS WORDS
FOR ALTHOUGH I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS TO YOU BEFORE
HIS WORDS ARE LIKE THE IMAGES OF SILENUS WHICH OPEN THEY ARE RIDICULOUS
WHEN YOU FIRST HEAR THEM HE CLOTHES HIMSELF IN LANGUAGE THAT IS LIKE
THE SKIN OF THE WANTON SATYR FOR HIS TALK IS OF PACK ASSES AND SMITHS
AND COBBLERS AND CURRIERS AND HE IS ALWAYS REPEATING THE SAME THINGS
IN THE SAME WORDS COMPARE GORG SO THAT ANY IGNORANT OR INEXPERIENCED
PERSON MIGHT FEEL DISPOSED TO LAUGH AT HIM BUT HE WHO OPENS THE BUST
AND SEES WHAT IS WITHIN WILL FIND THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY WORDS WHICH
HAVE A MEANING IN THEM AND ALSO THE MOST DIVINE ABOUNDING IN FAIR
IMAGES OF VIRTUE AND OF THE WIDEST COMPREHENSION OR RATHER EXTENDING
TO THE WHOLE DUTY OF A GOOD AND HONOURABLE MAN
THIS FRIENDS IS MY PRAISE OF SOCRATES
I HAVE ADDED MY BLAME OF HIM
FOR HIS ILL TREATMENT OF ME AND HE HAS ILL TREATED NOT ONLY ME BUT
CHARMIDES THE SON OF GLAUCON AND EUTHYDEMUS THE SON OF DIOCLES AND
MANY OTHERS IN THE SAME WAY BEGINNING AS THEIR LOVER HE HAS ENDED BY
MAKING THEM PAY THEIR ADDRESSES TO HIM
WHEREFORE I SAY TO YOU AGATHON
'BE NOT DECEIVED BY HIM LEARN FROM ME AND TAKE WARNING AND DO NOT BE A
FOOL AND LEARN BY EXPERIENCE AS THE PROVERB SAYS
WHEN ALCIBIADES HAD FINISHED THERE WAS A LAUGH AT HIS OUTSPOKENNESS
FOR HE SEEMED TO BE STILL IN LOVE WITH SOCRATES
YOU ARE SOBER
ALCIBIADES SAID SOCRATES OR YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE SO FAR ABOUT
TO HIDE THE PURPOSE OF YOUR SATYR'S PRAISES FOR ALL THIS LONG STORY IS
ONLY AN INGENIOUS CIRCUMLOCUTION OF WHICH THE POINT COMES IN BY THE
WAY AT THE END YOU WANT TO GET UP A QUARREL BETWEEN ME AND AGATHON AND
YOUR NOTION IS THAT I OUGHT TO LOVE YOU AND NOBODY ELSE AND THAT YOU
AND YOU ONLY OUGHT TO LOVE AGATHON
BUT THE PLOT OF THIS SATYRIC OR
SILENIC DRAMA HAS BEEN DETECTED AND YOU MUST NOT ALLOW HIM AGATHON TO
SET US AT VARIANCE
I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT SAID AGATHON AND I AM DISPOSED TO THINK THAT
HIS INTENTION IN PLACING HIMSELF BETWEEN YOU AND ME WAS ONLY TO DIVIDE
US BUT HE SHALL GAIN NOTHING BY THAT MOVE FOR I WILL GO AND LIE ON THE
COUCH NEXT TO YOU
YES YES REPLIED SOCRATES BY ALL MEANS COME HERE AND LIE ON THE COUCH
BELOW ME
ALAS SAID ALCIBIADES HOW I AM FOOLED BY THIS MAN HE IS DETERMINED TO
GET THE BETTER OF ME AT EVERY TURN
I DO BESEECH YOU ALLOW AGATHON TO
LIE BETWEEN US
CERTAINLY NOT SAID SOCRATES AS YOU PRAISED ME AND I IN TURN OUGHT TO
PRAISE MY NEIGHBOUR ON THE RIGHT HE WILL BE OUT OF ORDER IN PRAISING ME
AGAIN WHEN HE OUGHT RATHER TO BE PRAISED BY ME AND I MUST ENTREAT YOU
TO CONSENT TO THIS AND NOT BE JEALOUS FOR I HAVE A GREAT DESIRE TO
PRAISE THE YOUTH
HURRAH CRIED AGATHON I WILL RISE INSTANTLY THAT I MAY BE PRAISED BY
SOCRATES
THE USUAL WAY SAID ALCIBIADES WHERE SOCRATES IS NO ONE ELSE HAS ANY
CHANCE WITH THE FAIR AND NOW HOW READILY HAS HE INVENTED A SPECIOUS
REASON FOR ATTRACTING AGATHON TO HIMSELF
AGATHON AROSE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT TAKE HIS PLACE ON THE COUCH BY
SOCRATES WHEN SUDDENLY A BAND OF REVELLERS ENTERED AND SPOILED THE
ORDER OF THE BANQUET
SOME ONE WHO WAS GOING OUT HAVING LEFT THE DOOR
OPEN THEY HAD FOUND THEIR WAY IN AND MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME GREAT
CONFUSION ENSUED AND EVERY ONE WAS COMPELLED TO DRINK LARGE QUANTITIES
OF WINE
ARISTODEMUS SAID THAT ERYXIMACHUS PHAEDRUS AND OTHERS WENT
AWAY HE HIMSELF FELL ASLEEP AND AS THE NIGHTS WERE LONG TOOK A GOOD
REST HE WAS AWAKENED TOWARDS DAYBREAK BY A CROWING OF COCKS AND
WHEN HE AWOKE THE OTHERS WERE EITHER ASLEEP OR HAD GONE AWAY THERE
REMAINED ONLY SOCRATES ARISTOPHANES AND AGATHON WHO WERE DRINKING OUT
OF A LARGE GOBLET WHICH THEY PASSED ROUND AND SOCRATES WAS DISCOURSING
TO THEM
ARISTODEMUS WAS ONLY HALF AWAKE AND HE DID NOT HEAR THE
BEGINNING OF THE DISCOURSE THE CHIEF THING WHICH HE REMEMBERED WAS
SOCRATES COMPELLING THE OTHER TWO TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE GENIUS OF
COMEDY WAS THE SAME WITH THAT OF TRAGEDY AND THAT THE TRUE ARTIST IN
TRAGEDY WAS AN ARTIST IN COMEDY ALSO
TO THIS THEY WERE CONSTRAINED TO
ASSENT BEING DROWSY AND NOT QUITE FOLLOWING THE ARGUMENT
AND FIRST
OF ALL ARISTOPHANES DROPPED OFF THEN WHEN THE DAY WAS ALREADY
DAWNING AGATHON
SOCRATES HAVING LAID THEM TO SLEEP ROSE TO DEPART
ARISTODEMUS AS HIS MANNER WAS FOLLOWING HIM
AT THE LYCEUM HE TOOK A
BATH AND PASSED THE DAY AS USUAL
IN THE EVENING HE RETIRED TO REST AT
HIS OWN HOME

BY PLATO
TRANSLATED BY BENJAMIN JOWETT
INTRODUCTION
IN THE MENO ANYTUS HAD PARTED FROM SOCRATES WITH THE SIGNIFICANT WORDS
'THAT IN ANY CITY AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CITY OF ATHENS IT IS EASIER
TO DO MEN HARM THAN TO DO THEM GOOD AND SOCRATES WAS ANTICIPATING
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING WITH HIM
IN THE EUTHYPHRO SOCRATES IS
AWAITING HIS TRIAL FOR IMPIETY
BUT BEFORE THE TRIAL BEGINS PLATO WOULD
LIKE TO PUT THE WORLD ON THEIR TRIAL AND CONVINCE THEM OF IGNORANCE IN
THAT VERY MATTER TOUCHING WHICH SOCRATES IS ACCUSED
AN INCIDENT WHICH
MAY PERHAPS REALLY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE FAMILY OF EUTHYPHRO A
LEARNED ATHENIAN DIVINER AND SOOTHSAYER FURNISHES THE OCCASION OF THE
DISCUSSION
THIS EUTHYPHRO AND SOCRATES ARE REPRESENTED AS MEETING IN THE PORCH OF
THE KING ARCHON
COMPARE THEAET BOTH HAVE LEGAL BUSINESS IN HAND
SOCRATES IS DEFENDANT IN A SUIT FOR IMPIETY WHICH MELETUS HAS BROUGHT
AGAINST HIM IT IS REMARKED BY THE WAY THAT HE IS NOT A LIKELY MAN
HIMSELF TO HAVE BROUGHT A SUIT AGAINST ANOTHER AND EUTHYPHRO TOO IS
PLAINTIFF IN AN ACTION FOR MURDER WHICH HE HAS BROUGHT AGAINST HIS
OWN FATHER
THE LATTER HAS ORIGINATED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER A POOR
DEPENDANT OF THE FAMILY HAD SLAIN ONE OF THEIR DOMESTIC SLAVES IN NAXOS
THE GUILTY PERSON WAS BOUND AND THROWN INTO A DITCH BY THE COMMAND OF
EUTHYPHRO'S FATHER WHO SENT TO THE INTERPRETERS OF RELIGION AT ATHENS
TO ASK WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH HIM
BEFORE THE MESSENGER CAME BACK THE
CRIMINAL HAD DIED FROM HUNGER AND EXPOSURE
THIS IS THE ORIGIN OF THE CHARGE OF MURDER WHICH EUTHYPHRO BRINGS
AGAINST HIS FATHER
SOCRATES IS CONFIDENT THAT BEFORE HE COULD HAVE
UNDERTAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SUCH A PROSECUTION HE MUST HAVE BEEN
PERFECTLY INFORMED OF THE NATURE OF PIETY AND IMPIETY AND AS HE IS
GOING TO BE TRIED FOR IMPIETY HIMSELF HE THINKS THAT HE CANNOT DO
BETTER THAN LEARN OF EUTHYPHRO WHO WILL BE ADMITTED BY EVERYBODY
INCLUDING THE JUDGES TO BE AN UNIMPEACHABLE AUTHORITY WHAT PIETY IS
AND WHAT IS IMPIETY
WHAT THEN IS PIETY
EUTHYPHRO WHO IN THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE IS VERY WILLING TO
UNDERTAKE ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY REPLIES THAT PIETY IS DOING AS I DO
PROSECUTING YOUR FATHER IF HE IS GUILTY ON A CHARGE OF MURDER DOING
AS THE GODS DO AS ZEUS DID TO CRONOS AND CRONOS TO URANUS
SOCRATES HAS A DISLIKE TO THESE TALES OF MYTHOLOGY AND HE FANCIES THAT
THIS DISLIKE OF HIS MAY BE THE REASON WHY HE IS CHARGED WITH IMPIETY
'ARE THEY REALLY TRUE 'YES THEY ARE AND EUTHYPHRO WILL GLADLY TELL
SOCRATES SOME MORE OF THEM
BUT SOCRATES WOULD LIKE FIRST OF ALL TO HAVE
A MORE SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION 'WHAT IS PIETY 'DOING AS
I DO CHARGING A FATHER WITH MURDER MAY BE A SINGLE INSTANCE OF PIETY
BUT CAN HARDLY BE REGARDED AS A GENERAL DEFINITION
EUTHYPHRO REPLIES THAT 'PIETY IS WHAT IS DEAR TO THE GODS AND IMPIETY
IS WHAT IS NOT DEAR TO THEM BUT MAY THERE NOT BE DIFFERENCES OF
OPINION AS AMONG MEN SO ALSO AMONG THE GODS ESPECIALLY ABOUT GOOD
AND EVIL WHICH HAVE NO FIXED RULE AND THESE ARE PRECISELY THE SORT OF
DIFFERENCES WHICH GIVE RISE TO QUARRELS
AND THEREFORE WHAT MAY BE DEAR
TO ONE GOD MAY NOT BE DEAR TO ANOTHER AND THE SAME ACTION MAY BE BOTH
PIOUS AND IMPIOUS E G
YOUR CHASTISEMENT OF YOUR FATHER EUTHYPHRO MAY
BE DEAR OR PLEASING TO ZEUS WHO INFLICTED A SIMILAR CHASTISEMENT ON HIS
OWN FATHER BUT NOT EQUALLY PLEASING TO CRONOS OR URANUS WHO SUFFERED
AT THE HANDS OF THEIR SONS
EUTHYPHRO ANSWERS THAT THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION EITHER AMONG
GODS OR MEN AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF PUNISHING A MURDERER
YES REJOINS
SOCRATES WHEN THEY KNOW HIM TO BE A MURDERER BUT YOU ARE ASSUMING THE
POINT AT ISSUE
IF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE ARE CONSIDERED ARE
YOU ABLE TO SHOW THAT YOUR FATHER WAS GUILTY OF MURDER OR THAT ALL THE
GODS ARE AGREED IN APPROVING OF OUR PROSECUTION OF HIM AND MUST YOU
NOT ALLOW THAT WHAT IS HATED BY ONE GOD MAY BE LIKED BY ANOTHER WAIVING
THIS LAST HOWEVER SOCRATES PROPOSES TO AMEND THE DEFINITION AND
SAY THAT 'WHAT ALL THE GODS LOVE IS PIOUS AND WHAT THEY ALL HATE IS
IMPIOUS TO THIS EUTHYPHRO AGREES
SOCRATES PROCEEDS TO ANALYZE THE NEW FORM OF THE DEFINITION
HE SHOWS
THAT IN OTHER CASES THE ACT PRECEDES THE STATE E G
THE ACT OF BEING
CARRIED LOVED ETC
PRECEDES THE STATE OF BEING CARRIED LOVED ETC
AND THEREFORE THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO THE GODS IS DEAR TO THE GODS BECAUSE
IT IS FIRST LOVED OF THEM NOT LOVED OF THEM BECAUSE IT IS DEAR TO THEM
BUT THE PIOUS OR HOLY IS LOVED BY THE GODS BECAUSE IT IS PIOUS OR HOLY
WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO SAYING THAT IT IS LOVED BY THEM BECAUSE IT IS
DEAR TO THEM
HERE THEN APPEARS TO BE A CONTRADICTION EUTHYPHRO HAS
BEEN GIVING AN ATTRIBUTE OR ACCIDENT OF PIETY ONLY AND NOT THE ESSENCE
EUTHYPHRO ACKNOWLEDGES HIMSELF THAT HIS EXPLANATIONS SEEM TO WALK
AWAY OR GO ROUND IN A CIRCLE LIKE THE MOVING FIGURES OF DAEDALUS THE
ANCESTOR OF SOCRATES WHO HAS COMMUNICATED HIS ART TO HIS DESCENDANTS
SOCRATES WHO IS DESIROUS OF STIMULATING THE INDOLENT INTELLIGENCE OF
EUTHYPHRO RAISES THE QUESTION IN ANOTHER MANNER 'IS ALL THE PIOUS
JUST 'YES 'IS ALL THE JUST PIOUS 'NO 'THEN WHAT PART OF JUSTICE
IS PIETY EUTHYPHRO REPLIES THAT PIETY IS THAT PART OF JUSTICE WHICH
'ATTENDS' TO THE GODS AS THERE IS ANOTHER PART OF JUSTICE WHICH
'ATTENDS' TO MEN
BUT WHAT IS THE MEANING OF 'ATTENDING' TO THE GODS
THE WORD 'ATTENDING WHEN APPLIED TO DOGS HORSES AND MEN IMPLIES
THAT IN SOME WAY THEY ARE MADE BETTER
BUT HOW DO PIOUS OR HOLY ACTS
MAKE THE GODS ANY BETTER EUTHYPHRO EXPLAINS THAT HE MEANS BY PIOUS
ACTS ACTS OF SERVICE OR MINISTRATION
YES BUT THE MINISTRATIONS OF THE
HUSBANDMAN THE PHYSICIAN AND THE BUILDER HAVE AN END
TO WHAT END DO
WE SERVE THE GODS AND WHAT DO WE HELP THEM TO ACCOMPLISH EUTHYPHRO
REPLIES THAT ALL THESE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS CANNOT BE RESOLVED IN A
SHORT TIME AND HE WOULD RATHER SAY SIMPLY THAT PIETY IS KNOWING HOW TO
PLEASE THE GODS IN WORD AND DEED BY PRAYERS AND SACRIFICES
IN OTHER
WORDS SAYS SOCRATES PIETY IS 'A SCIENCE OF ASKING AND GIVING' ASKING
WHAT WE WANT AND GIVING WHAT THEY WANT IN SHORT A MODE OF DOING
BUSINESS BETWEEN GODS AND MEN
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE THE GIVERS OF ALL
GOOD HOW CAN WE GIVE THEM ANY GOOD IN RETURN 'NAY BUT WE GIVE THEM
HONOUR THEN WE GIVE THEM NOT WHAT IS BENEFICIAL BUT WHAT IS PLEASING
OR DEAR TO THEM AND THIS IS THE POINT WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY DISPROVED
SOCRATES ALTHOUGH WEARY OF THE SUBTERFUGES AND EVASIONS OF EUTHYPHRO
REMAINS UNSHAKEN IN HIS CONVICTION THAT HE MUST KNOW THE NATURE OF
PIETY OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE PROSECUTED HIS OLD FATHER
HE IS STILL
HOPING THAT HE WILL CONDESCEND TO INSTRUCT HIM
BUT EUTHYPHRO IS IN A
HURRY AND CANNOT STAY
AND SOCRATES' LAST HOPE OF KNOWING THE NATURE
OF PIETY BEFORE HE IS PROSECUTED FOR IMPIETY HAS DISAPPEARED
AS IN THE
EUTHYDEMUS THE IRONY IS CARRIED ON TO THE END
THE EUTHYPHRO IS MANIFESTLY DESIGNED TO CONTRAST THE REAL NATURE OF
PIETY AND IMPIETY WITH THE POPULAR CONCEPTIONS OF THEM
BUT WHEN THE
POPULAR CONCEPTIONS OF THEM HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN SOCRATES DOES NOT
OFFER ANY DEFINITION OF HIS OWN AS IN THE LACHES AND LYSIS HE PREPARES
THE WAY FOR AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHICH HE HAS RAISED BUT TRUE TO
HIS OWN CHARACTER REFUSES TO ANSWER HIMSELF
EUTHYPHRO IS A RELIGIONIST AND IS ELSEWHERE SPOKEN OF IF HE BE THE
SAME PERSON AS THE AUTHOR OF A PHILOSOPHY OF NAMES BY WHOSE 'PRANCING
STEEDS' SOCRATES IN THE CRATYLUS IS CARRIED AWAY
HE HAS THE CONCEIT AND
SELF CONFIDENCE OF A SOPHIST NO DOUBT THAT HE IS RIGHT IN PROSECUTING
HIS FATHER HAS EVER ENTERED INTO HIS MIND
LIKE A SOPHIST TOO HE IS
INCAPABLE EITHER OF FRAMING A GENERAL DEFINITION OR OF FOLLOWING THE
COURSE OF AN ARGUMENT
HIS WRONG HEADEDNESS ONE SIDEDNESS NARROWNESS
POSITIVENESS ARE CHARACTERISTIC OF HIS PRIESTLY OFFICE
HIS FAILURE
TO APPREHEND AN ARGUMENT MAY BE COMPARED TO A SIMILAR DEFECT WHICH
IS OBSERVABLE IN THE RHAPSODE ION
BUT HE IS NOT A BAD MAN AND HE IS
FRIENDLY TO SOCRATES WHOSE FAMILIAR SIGN HE RECOGNIZES WITH INTEREST
THOUGH UNABLE TO FOLLOW HIM HE IS VERY WILLING TO BE LED BY HIM AND
EAGERLY CATCHES AT ANY SUGGESTION WHICH SAVES HIM FROM THE TROUBLE
OF THINKING
MOREOVER HE IS THE ENEMY OF MELETUS WHO AS HE SAYS IS
AVAILING HIMSELF OF THE POPULAR DISLIKE TO INNOVATIONS IN RELIGION IN
ORDER TO INJURE SOCRATES AT THE SAME TIME HE IS AMUSINGLY CONFIDENT
THAT HE HAS WEAPONS IN HIS OWN ARMOURY WHICH WOULD BE MORE THAN A MATCH
FOR HIM
HE IS QUITE SINCERE IN HIS PROSECUTION OF HIS FATHER WHO HAS
ACCIDENTALLY BEEN GUILTY OF HOMICIDE AND IS NOT WHOLLY FREE FROM BLAME
TO PURGE AWAY THE CRIME APPEARS TO HIM IN THE LIGHT OF A DUTY WHOEVER
MAY BE THE CRIMINAL
THUS BEGINS THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE RELIGION OF THE LETTER OR OF THE
NARROW AND UNENLIGHTENED CONSCIENCE AND THE HIGHER NOTION OF RELIGION
WHICH SOCRATES VAINLY ENDEAVOURS TO ELICIT FROM HIM
'PIETY IS DOING
AS I DO' IS THE IDEA OF RELIGION WHICH FIRST OCCURS TO HIM AND TO MANY
OTHERS WHO DO NOT SAY WHAT THEY THINK WITH EQUAL FRANKNESS
FOR MEN ARE
NOT EASILY PERSUADED THAT ANY OTHER RELIGION IS BETTER THAN THEIR OWN
OR THAT OTHER NATIONS E G
THE GREEKS IN THE TIME OF SOCRATES WERE
EQUALLY SERIOUS IN THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND DIFFICULTIES
THE CHIEF
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THEM IS THAT THEY WERE SLOWLY LEARNING WHAT
WE ARE IN PROCESS OF FORGETTING
GREEK MYTHOLOGY HARDLY ADMITTED OF THE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ACCIDENTAL HOMICIDE AND MURDER THAT THE POLLUTION
OF BLOOD WAS THE SAME IN BOTH CASES IS ALSO THE FEELING OF THE ATHENIAN
DIVINER
HE HAD NOT AS YET LEARNED THE LESSON WHICH PHILOSOPHY WAS
TEACHING THAT HOMER AND HESIOD IF NOT BANISHED FROM THE STATE OR
WHIPPED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY AS HERACLEITUS MORE RUDELY PROPOSED AT ANY
RATE WERE NOT TO BE APPEALED TO AS AUTHORITIES IN RELIGION AND HE IS
READY TO DEFEND HIS CONDUCT BY THE EXAMPLES OF THE GODS
THESE ARE THE
VERY TALES WHICH SOCRATES CANNOT ABIDE AND HIS DISLIKE OF THEM AS HE
SUSPECTS HAS BRANDED HIM WITH THE REPUTATION OF IMPIETY
HERE IS ONE
ANSWER TO THE QUESTION 'WHY SOCRATES WAS PUT TO DEATH SUGGESTED BY
THE WAY
ANOTHER IS CONVEYED IN THE WORDS 'THE ATHENIANS DO NOT CARE
ABOUT ANY MAN BEING THOUGHT WISE UNTIL HE BEGINS TO MAKE OTHER MEN WISE
AND THEN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER THEY ARE ANGRY WHICH MAY BE SAID TO
BE THE RULE OF POPULAR TOLERATION IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES AND NOT AT
ATHENS ONLY
IN THE COURSE OF THE ARGUMENT SOCRATES REMARKS THAT THE
CONTROVERSIAL NATURE OF MORALS AND RELIGION ARISES OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY
OF VERIFYING THEM
THERE IS NO MEASURE OR STANDARD TO WHICH THEY CAN BE
REFERRED
THE NEXT DEFINITION 'PIETY IS THAT WHICH IS LOVED OF THE GODS IS
SHIPWRECKED ON A REFINED DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE ACT
CORRESPONDING RESPECTIVELY TO THE ADJECTIVE PHILON AND THE PARTICIPLE
PHILOUMENON OR RATHER PERHAPS TO THE PARTICIPLE AND THE VERB
PHILOUMENON AND PHILEITAI
THE ACT IS PRIOR TO THE STATE AS IN
ARISTOTLE THE ENERGEIA PRECEDES THE DUNAMIS AND THE STATE OF BEING
LOVED IS PRECEDED BY THE ACT OF BEING LOVED
BUT PIETY OR HOLINESS IS
PRECEDED BY THE ACT OF BEING PIOUS NOT BY THE ACT OF BEING LOVED AND
THEREFORE PIETY AND THE STATE OF BEING LOVED ARE DIFFERENT
THROUGH SUCH
SUBTLETIES OF DIALECTIC SOCRATES IS WORKING HIS WAY INTO A DEEPER REGION
OF THOUGHT AND FEELING
HE MEANS TO SAY THAT THE WORDS 'LOVED OF THE
GODS' EXPRESS AN ATTRIBUTE ONLY AND NOT THE ESSENCE OF PIETY
THEN FOLLOWS THE THIRD AND LAST DEFINITION 'PIETY IS A PART OF
JUSTICE THUS FAR SOCRATES HAS PROCEEDED IN PLACING RELIGION ON A
MORAL FOUNDATION
HE IS SEEKING TO REALIZE THE HARMONY OF RELIGION AND
MORALITY WHICH THE GREAT POETS AESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES AND PINDAR HAD
UNCONSCIOUSLY ANTICIPATED AND WHICH IS THE UNIVERSAL WANT OF ALL MEN
TO THIS THE SOOTHSAYER ADDS THE CEREMONIAL ELEMENT 'ATTENDING UPON THE
GODS WHEN FURTHER INTERROGATED BY SOCRATES AS TO THE NATURE OF
THIS 'ATTENTION TO THE GODS HE REPLIES THAT PIETY IS AN AFFAIR OF
BUSINESS A SCIENCE OF GIVING AND ASKING AND THE LIKE
SOCRATES POINTS
OUT THE ANTHROPOMORPHISM OF THESE NOTIONS COMPARE SYMP REPUBLIC
POLITICUS BUT WHEN WE EXPECT HIM TO GO ON AND SHOW THAT THE TRUE
SERVICE OF THE GODS IS THE SERVICE OF THE SPIRIT AND THE CO OPERATION
WITH THEM IN ALL THINGS TRUE AND GOOD HE STOPS SHORT THIS WAS A LESSON
WHICH THE SOOTHSAYER COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE TO UNDERSTAND AND WHICH
EVERY ONE MUST LEARN FOR HIMSELF
THERE SEEM TO BE ALTOGETHER THREE AIMS OR INTERESTS IN THIS LITTLE
DIALOGUE 1 THE DIALECTICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEA OF PIETY 2 THE
ANTITHESIS OF TRUE AND FALSE RELIGION WHICH IS CARRIED TO A CERTAIN
EXTENT ONLY 3 THE DEFENCE OF SOCRATES
THE SUBTLE CONNECTION WITH THE APOLOGY AND THE CRITO THE HOLDING BACK
OF THE CONCLUSION AS IN THE CHARMIDES LYSIS LACHES PROTAGORAS AND
OTHER DIALOGUES THE DEEP INSIGHT INTO THE RELIGIOUS WORLD THE DRAMATIC
POWER AND PLAY OF THE TWO CHARACTERS THE INIMITABLE IRONY ARE REASONS
FOR BELIEVING THAT THE EUTHYPHRO IS A GENUINE PLATONIC WRITING
THE
SPIRIT IN WHICH THE POPULAR REPRESENTATIONS OF MYTHOLOGY ARE DENOUNCED
RECALLS REPUBLIC II
THE VIRTUE OF PIETY HAS BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
AS ONE OF FIVE IN THE PROTAGORAS BUT IS NOT RECKONED AMONG THE FOUR
CARDINAL VIRTUES OF REPUBLIC IV
THE FIGURE OF DAEDALUS HAS OCCURRED IN
THE MENO THAT OF PROTEUS IN THE EUTHYDEMUS AND IO
THE KINGLY SCIENCE
HAS ALREADY APPEARED IN THE EUTHYDEMUS AND WILL REAPPEAR IN THE
REPUBLIC AND STATESMAN
BUT NEITHER FROM THESE NOR ANY OTHER INDICATIONS
OF SIMILARITY OR DIFFERENCE AND STILL LESS FROM ARGUMENTS RESPECTING
THE SUITABLENESS OF THIS LITTLE WORK TO AID SOCRATES AT THE TIME OF HIS
TRIAL OR THE REVERSE CAN ANY EVIDENCE OF THE DATE BE OBTAINED
EUTHYPHRO
PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE SOCRATES EUTHYPHRO
SCENE THE PORCH OF THE KING ARCHON
EUTHYPHRO WHY HAVE YOU LEFT THE LYCEUM SOCRATES AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THE PORCH OF THE KING ARCHON SURELY YOU CANNOT BE CONCERNED IN
A SUIT BEFORE THE KING LIKE MYSELF
SOCRATES NOT IN A SUIT EUTHYPHRO IMPEACHMENT IS THE WORD WHICH THE
ATHENIANS USE
EUTHYPHRO WHAT I SUPPOSE THAT SOME ONE HAS BEEN PROSECUTING YOU FOR I
CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE THE PROSECUTOR OF ANOTHER
SOCRATES CERTAINLY NOT
EUTHYPHRO THEN SOME ONE ELSE HAS BEEN PROSECUTING YOU
SOCRATES YES
EUTHYPHRO AND WHO IS HE
SOCRATES A YOUNG MAN WHO IS LITTLE KNOWN EUTHYPHRO AND I HARDLY KNOW
HIM HIS NAME IS MELETUS AND HE IS OF THE DEME OF PITTHIS
PERHAPS YOU
MAY REMEMBER HIS APPEARANCE HE HAS A BEAK AND LONG STRAIGHT HAIR AND
A BEARD WHICH IS ILL GROWN
EUTHYPHRO NO I DO NOT REMEMBER HIM SOCRATES
BUT WHAT IS THE CHARGE
WHICH HE BRINGS AGAINST YOU
SOCRATES WHAT IS THE CHARGE WELL A VERY SERIOUS CHARGE WHICH SHOWS
A GOOD DEAL OF CHARACTER IN THE YOUNG MAN AND FOR WHICH HE IS CERTAINLY
NOT TO BE DESPISED
HE SAYS HE KNOWS HOW THE YOUTH ARE CORRUPTED AND
WHO ARE THEIR CORRUPTORS
I FANCY THAT HE MUST BE A WISE MAN AND SEEING
THAT I AM THE REVERSE OF A WISE MAN HE HAS FOUND ME OUT AND IS GOING
TO ACCUSE ME OF CORRUPTING HIS YOUNG FRIENDS
AND OF THIS OUR MOTHER THE
STATE IS TO BE THE JUDGE
OF ALL OUR POLITICAL MEN HE IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO SEEMS TO ME TO BEGIN IN THE RIGHT WAY WITH THE CULTIVATION OF
VIRTUE IN YOUTH LIKE A GOOD HUSBANDMAN HE MAKES THE YOUNG SHOOTS HIS
FIRST CARE AND CLEARS AWAY US WHO ARE THE DESTROYERS OF THEM
THIS IS
ONLY THE FIRST STEP HE WILL AFTERWARDS ATTEND TO THE ELDER BRANCHES
AND IF HE GOES ON AS HE HAS BEGUN HE WILL BE A VERY GREAT PUBLIC
BENEFACTOR
EUTHYPHRO I HOPE THAT HE MAY BUT I RATHER FEAR SOCRATES THAT THE
OPPOSITE WILL TURN OUT TO BE THE TRUTH
MY OPINION IS THAT IN ATTACKING
YOU HE IS SIMPLY AIMING A BLOW AT THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE
BUT IN
WHAT WAY DOES HE SAY THAT YOU CORRUPT THE YOUNG
SOCRATES HE BRINGS A WONDERFUL ACCUSATION AGAINST ME WHICH AT FIRST
HEARING EXCITES SURPRISE HE SAYS THAT I AM A POET OR MAKER OF GODS AND
THAT I INVENT NEW GODS AND DENY THE EXISTENCE OF OLD ONES THIS IS THE
GROUND OF HIS INDICTMENT
EUTHYPHRO I UNDERSTAND SOCRATES HE MEANS TO ATTACK YOU ABOUT THE
FAMILIAR SIGN WHICH OCCASIONALLY AS YOU SAY COMES TO YOU
HE THINKS
THAT YOU ARE A NEOLOGIAN AND HE IS GOING TO HAVE YOU UP BEFORE THE
COURT FOR THIS
HE KNOWS THAT SUCH A CHARGE IS READILY RECEIVED BY THE
WORLD AS I MYSELF KNOW TOO WELL FOR WHEN I SPEAK IN THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT
DIVINE THINGS AND FORETELL THE FUTURE TO THEM THEY LAUGH AT ME AND
THINK ME A MADMAN
YET EVERY WORD THAT I SAY IS TRUE
BUT THEY ARE
JEALOUS OF US ALL AND WE MUST BE BRAVE AND GO AT THEM
SOCRATES THEIR LAUGHTER FRIEND EUTHYPHRO IS NOT A MATTER OF MUCH
CONSEQUENCE
FOR A MAN MAY BE THOUGHT WISE BUT THE ATHENIANS I
SUSPECT DO NOT MUCH TROUBLE THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM UNTIL HE BEGINS TO
IMPART HIS WISDOM TO OTHERS AND THEN FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER PERHAPS
AS YOU SAY FROM JEALOUSY THEY ARE ANGRY
EUTHYPHRO I AM NEVER LIKELY TO TRY THEIR TEMPER IN THIS WAY
SOCRATES I DARE SAY NOT FOR YOU ARE RESERVED IN YOUR BEHAVIOUR AND
SELDOM IMPART YOUR WISDOM
BUT I HAVE A BENEVOLENT HABIT OF POURING OUT
MYSELF TO EVERYBODY AND WOULD EVEN PAY FOR A LISTENER AND I AM AFRAID
THAT THE ATHENIANS MAY THINK ME TOO TALKATIVE
NOW IF AS I WAS SAYING
THEY WOULD ONLY LAUGH AT ME AS YOU SAY THAT THEY LAUGH AT YOU THE
TIME MIGHT PASS GAILY ENOUGH IN THE COURT BUT PERHAPS THEY MAY BE IN
EARNEST AND THEN WHAT THE END WILL BE YOU SOOTHSAYERS ONLY CAN PREDICT
EUTHYPHRO I DARE SAY THAT THE AFFAIR WILL END IN NOTHING SOCRATES AND
THAT YOU WILL WIN YOUR CAUSE AND I THINK THAT I SHALL WIN MY OWN
SOCRATES AND WHAT IS YOUR SUIT EUTHYPHRO ARE YOU THE PURSUER OR THE
DEFENDANT
EUTHYPHRO I AM THE PURSUER
SOCRATES OF WHOM
EUTHYPHRO YOU WILL THINK ME MAD WHEN I TELL YOU
SOCRATES WHY HAS THE FUGITIVE WINGS
EUTHYPHRO NAY HE IS NOT VERY VOLATILE AT HIS TIME OF LIFE
SOCRATES WHO IS HE
EUTHYPHRO MY FATHER
SOCRATES YOUR FATHER MY GOOD MAN
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES AND OF WHAT IS HE ACCUSED
EUTHYPHRO OF MURDER SOCRATES
SOCRATES BY THE POWERS EUTHYPHRO HOW LITTLE DOES THE COMMON HERD KNOW
OF THE NATURE OF RIGHT AND TRUTH
A MAN MUST BE AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN
AND HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN WISDOM BEFORE HE COULD HAVE SEEN HIS WAY
TO BRING SUCH AN ACTION
EUTHYPHRO INDEED SOCRATES HE MUST
SOCRATES I SUPPOSE THAT THE MAN WHOM YOUR FATHER MURDERED WAS ONE OF
YOUR RELATIVES CLEARLY HE WAS FOR IF HE HAD BEEN A STRANGER YOU WOULD
NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF PROSECUTING HIM
EUTHYPHRO I AM AMUSED SOCRATES AT YOUR MAKING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN
ONE WHO IS A RELATION AND ONE WHO IS NOT A RELATION FOR SURELY THE
POLLUTION IS THE SAME IN EITHER CASE IF YOU KNOWINGLY ASSOCIATE WITH
THE MURDERER WHEN YOU OUGHT TO CLEAR YOURSELF AND HIM BY PROCEEDING
AGAINST HIM
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THE MURDERED MAN HAS BEEN
JUSTLY SLAIN
IF JUSTLY THEN YOUR DUTY IS TO LET THE MATTER ALONE BUT
IF UNJUSTLY THEN EVEN IF THE MURDERER LIVES UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH
YOU AND EATS AT THE SAME TABLE PROCEED AGAINST HIM
NOW THE MAN WHO IS
DEAD WAS A POOR DEPENDANT OF MINE WHO WORKED FOR US AS A FIELD LABOURER
ON OUR FARM IN NAXOS AND ONE DAY IN A FIT OF DRUNKEN PASSION HE GOT
INTO A QUARREL WITH ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SERVANTS AND SLEW HIM
MY FATHER
BOUND HIM HAND AND FOOT AND THREW HIM INTO A DITCH AND THEN SENT TO
ATHENS TO ASK OF A DIVINER WHAT HE SHOULD DO WITH HIM
MEANWHILE HE
NEVER ATTENDED TO HIM AND TOOK NO CARE ABOUT HIM FOR HE REGARDED HIM AS
A MURDERER AND THOUGHT THAT NO GREAT HARM WOULD BE DONE EVEN IF HE DID
DIE
NOW THIS WAS JUST WHAT HAPPENED
FOR SUCH WAS THE EFFECT OF COLD
AND HUNGER AND CHAINS UPON HIM THAT BEFORE THE MESSENGER RETURNED FROM
THE DIVINER HE WAS DEAD
AND MY FATHER AND FAMILY ARE ANGRY WITH ME FOR
TAKING THE PART OF THE MURDERER AND PROSECUTING MY FATHER
THEY SAY
THAT HE DID NOT KILL HIM AND THAT IF HE DID THE DEAD MAN WAS BUT A
MURDERER AND I OUGHT NOT TO TAKE ANY NOTICE FOR THAT A SON IS IMPIOUS
WHO PROSECUTES A FATHER
WHICH SHOWS SOCRATES HOW LITTLE THEY KNOW
WHAT THE GODS THINK ABOUT PIETY AND IMPIETY
SOCRATES GOOD HEAVENS EUTHYPHRO AND IS YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF RELIGION
AND OF THINGS PIOUS AND IMPIOUS SO VERY EXACT THAT SUPPOSING THE
CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE AS YOU STATE THEM YOU ARE NOT AFRAID LEST YOU TOO
MAY BE DOING AN IMPIOUS THING IN BRINGING AN ACTION AGAINST YOUR FATHER
EUTHYPHRO THE BEST OF EUTHYPHRO AND THAT WHICH DISTINGUISHES HIM
SOCRATES FROM OTHER MEN IS HIS EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF ALL SUCH MATTERS
WHAT SHOULD I BE GOOD FOR WITHOUT IT
SOCRATES RARE FRIEND I THINK THAT I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN BE YOUR
DISCIPLE
THEN BEFORE THE TRIAL WITH MELETUS COMES ON I SHALL CHALLENGE
HIM AND SAY THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A GREAT INTEREST IN RELIGIOUS
QUESTIONS AND NOW AS HE CHARGES ME WITH RASH IMAGINATIONS AND
INNOVATIONS IN RELIGION I HAVE BECOME YOUR DISCIPLE
YOU MELETUS AS
I SHALL SAY TO HIM ACKNOWLEDGE EUTHYPHRO TO BE A GREAT THEOLOGIAN AND
SOUND IN HIS OPINIONS AND IF YOU APPROVE OF HIM YOU OUGHT TO APPROVE OF
ME AND NOT HAVE ME INTO COURT BUT IF YOU DISAPPROVE YOU SHOULD BEGIN
BY INDICTING HIM WHO IS MY TEACHER AND WHO WILL BE THE RUIN NOT OF THE
YOUNG BUT OF THE OLD THAT IS TO SAY OF MYSELF WHOM HE INSTRUCTS
AND OF HIS OLD FATHER WHOM HE ADMONISHES AND CHASTISES
AND IF MELETUS
REFUSES TO LISTEN TO ME BUT WILL GO ON AND WILL NOT SHIFT THE
INDICTMENT FROM ME TO YOU I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN REPEAT THIS CHALLENGE
IN THE COURT
EUTHYPHRO YES INDEED SOCRATES AND IF HE ATTEMPTS TO INDICT ME I AM
MISTAKEN IF I DO NOT FIND A FLAW IN HIM THE COURT SHALL HAVE A GREAT
DEAL MORE TO SAY TO HIM THAN TO ME
SOCRATES AND I MY DEAR FRIEND KNOWING THIS AM DESIROUS OF BECOMING
YOUR DISCIPLE
FOR I OBSERVE THAT NO ONE APPEARS TO NOTICE YOU NOT EVEN
THIS MELETUS BUT HIS SHARP EYES HAVE FOUND ME OUT AT ONCE AND HE HAS
INDICTED ME FOR IMPIETY
AND THEREFORE I ADJURE YOU TO TELL ME THE
NATURE OF PIETY AND IMPIETY WHICH YOU SAID THAT YOU KNEW SO WELL AND
OF MURDER AND OF OTHER OFFENCES AGAINST THE GODS
WHAT ARE THEY IS
NOT PIETY IN EVERY ACTION ALWAYS THE SAME AND IMPIETY AGAIN IS IT NOT
ALWAYS THE OPPOSITE OF PIETY AND ALSO THE SAME WITH ITSELF HAVING AS
IMPIETY ONE NOTION WHICH INCLUDES WHATEVER IS IMPIOUS
EUTHYPHRO TO BE SURE SOCRATES
SOCRATES AND WHAT IS PIETY AND WHAT IS IMPIETY
EUTHYPHRO PIETY IS DOING AS I AM DOING THAT IS TO SAY PROSECUTING ANY
ONE WHO IS GUILTY OF MURDER SACRILEGE OR OF ANY SIMILAR CRIME WHETHER
HE BE YOUR FATHER OR MOTHER OR WHOEVER HE MAY BE THAT MAKES NO
DIFFERENCE AND NOT TO PROSECUTE THEM IS IMPIETY
AND PLEASE TO
CONSIDER SOCRATES WHAT A NOTABLE PROOF I WILL GIVE YOU OF THE TRUTH
OF MY WORDS A PROOF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN TO OTHERS OF THE
PRINCIPLE I MEAN THAT THE IMPIOUS WHOEVER HE MAY BE OUGHT NOT TO GO
UNPUNISHED
FOR DO NOT MEN REGARD ZEUS AS THE BEST AND MOST RIGHTEOUS OF
THE GODS AND YET THEY ADMIT THAT HE BOUND HIS FATHER CRONOS BECAUSE
HE WICKEDLY DEVOURED HIS SONS AND THAT HE TOO HAD PUNISHED HIS OWN
FATHER URANUS FOR A SIMILAR REASON IN A NAMELESS MANNER
AND YET WHEN
I PROCEED AGAINST MY FATHER THEY ARE ANGRY WITH ME
SO INCONSISTENT ARE
THEY IN THEIR WAY OF TALKING WHEN THE GODS ARE CONCERNED AND WHEN I AM
CONCERNED
SOCRATES MAY NOT THIS BE THE REASON EUTHYPHRO WHY I AM CHARGED WITH
IMPIETY THAT I CANNOT AWAY WITH THESE STORIES ABOUT THE GODS AND
THEREFORE I SUPPOSE THAT PEOPLE THINK ME WRONG
BUT AS YOU WHO ARE WELL
INFORMED ABOUT THEM APPROVE OF THEM I CANNOT DO BETTER THAN ASSENT TO
YOUR SUPERIOR WISDOM
WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY CONFESSING AS I DO THAT
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM TELL ME FOR THE LOVE OF ZEUS WHETHER YOU
REALLY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE TRUE
EUTHYPHRO YES SOCRATES AND THINGS MORE WONDERFUL STILL OF WHICH THE
WORLD IS IN IGNORANCE
SOCRATES AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE GODS FOUGHT WITH ONE
ANOTHER AND HAD DIRE QUARRELS BATTLES AND THE LIKE AS THE POETS
SAY AND AS YOU MAY SEE REPRESENTED IN THE WORKS OF GREAT ARTISTS
THE TEMPLES ARE FULL OF THEM AND NOTABLY THE ROBE OF ATHENE WHICH IS
CARRIED UP TO THE ACROPOLIS AT THE GREAT PANATHENAEA IS EMBROIDERED
WITH THEM
ARE ALL THESE TALES OF THE GODS TRUE EUTHYPHRO
EUTHYPHRO YES SOCRATES AND AS I WAS SAYING I CAN TELL YOU IF YOU
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THEM MANY OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE GODS WHICH WOULD
QUITE AMAZE YOU
SOCRATES I DARE SAY AND YOU SHALL TELL ME THEM AT SOME OTHER TIME WHEN
I HAVE LEISURE
BUT JUST AT PRESENT I WOULD RATHER HEAR FROM YOU A
MORE PRECISE ANSWER WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET GIVEN MY FRIEND TO THE
QUESTION WHAT IS 'PIETY' WHEN ASKED YOU ONLY REPLIED DOING AS YOU
DO CHARGING YOUR FATHER WITH MURDER
EUTHYPHRO AND WHAT I SAID WAS TRUE SOCRATES
SOCRATES NO DOUBT EUTHYPHRO BUT YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT THERE ARE MANY
OTHER PIOUS ACTS
EUTHYPHRO THERE ARE
SOCRATES REMEMBER THAT I DID NOT ASK YOU TO GIVE ME TWO OR THREE
EXAMPLES OF PIETY BUT TO EXPLAIN THE GENERAL IDEA WHICH MAKES ALL PIOUS
THINGS TO BE PIOUS
DO YOU NOT RECOLLECT THAT THERE WAS ONE IDEA WHICH
MADE THE IMPIOUS IMPIOUS AND THE PIOUS PIOUS
EUTHYPHRO I REMEMBER
SOCRATES TELL ME WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS IDEA AND THEN I SHALL
HAVE A STANDARD TO WHICH I MAY LOOK AND BY WHICH I MAY MEASURE ACTIONS
WHETHER YOURS OR THOSE OF ANY ONE ELSE AND THEN I SHALL BE ABLE TO SAY
THAT SUCH AND SUCH AN ACTION IS PIOUS SUCH ANOTHER IMPIOUS
EUTHYPHRO I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE
SOCRATES I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE
EUTHYPHRO PIETY THEN IS THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO THE GODS AND IMPIETY
IS THAT WHICH IS NOT DEAR TO THEM
SOCRATES VERY GOOD EUTHYPHRO YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN ME THE SORT OF ANSWER
WHICH I WANTED
BUT WHETHER WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE OR NOT I CANNOT AS YET
TELL ALTHOUGH I MAKE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF YOUR
WORDS
EUTHYPHRO OF COURSE
SOCRATES COME THEN AND LET US EXAMINE WHAT WE ARE SAYING
THAT THING
OR PERSON WHICH IS DEAR TO THE GODS IS PIOUS AND THAT THING OR PERSON
WHICH IS HATEFUL TO THE GODS IS IMPIOUS THESE TWO BEING THE EXTREME
OPPOSITES OF ONE ANOTHER
WAS NOT THAT SAID
EUTHYPHRO IT WAS
SOCRATES AND WELL SAID
EUTHYPHRO YES SOCRATES I THOUGHT SO IT WAS CERTAINLY SAID
SOCRATES AND FURTHER EUTHYPHRO THE GODS WERE ADMITTED TO HAVE
ENMITIES AND HATREDS AND DIFFERENCES
EUTHYPHRO YES THAT WAS ALSO SAID
SOCRATES AND WHAT SORT OF DIFFERENCE CREATES ENMITY AND ANGER SUPPOSE
FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU AND I MY GOOD FRIEND DIFFER ABOUT A NUMBER DO
DIFFERENCES OF THIS SORT MAKE US ENEMIES AND SET US AT VARIANCE WITH ONE
ANOTHER DO WE NOT GO AT ONCE TO ARITHMETIC AND PUT AN END TO THEM BY A
SUM
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES OR SUPPOSE THAT WE DIFFER ABOUT MAGNITUDES DO WE NOT QUICKLY
END THE DIFFERENCES BY MEASURING
EUTHYPHRO VERY TRUE
SOCRATES AND WE END A CONTROVERSY ABOUT HEAVY AND LIGHT BY RESORTING TO
A WEIGHING MACHINE
EUTHYPHRO TO BE SURE
SOCRATES BUT WHAT DIFFERENCES ARE THERE WHICH CANNOT BE THUS DECIDED
AND WHICH THEREFORE MAKE US ANGRY AND SET US AT ENMITY WITH ONE ANOTHER
I DARE SAY THE ANSWER DOES NOT OCCUR TO YOU AT THE MOMENT AND THEREFORE
I WILL SUGGEST THAT THESE ENMITIES ARISE WHEN THE MATTERS OF DIFFERENCE
ARE THE JUST AND UNJUST GOOD AND EVIL HONOURABLE AND DISHONOURABLE
ARE NOT THESE THE POINTS ABOUT WHICH MEN DIFFER AND ABOUT WHICH WHEN WE
ARE UNABLE SATISFACTORILY TO DECIDE OUR DIFFERENCES YOU AND I AND ALL
OF US QUARREL WHEN WE DO QUARREL COMPARE ALCIB
EUTHYPHRO YES SOCRATES THE NATURE OF THE DIFFERENCES ABOUT WHICH WE
QUARREL IS SUCH AS YOU DESCRIBE
SOCRATES AND THE QUARRELS OF THE GODS NOBLE EUTHYPHRO WHEN THEY
OCCUR ARE OF A LIKE NATURE
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY THEY ARE
SOCRATES THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AS YOU SAY ABOUT GOOD AND
EVIL JUST AND UNJUST HONOURABLE AND DISHONOURABLE THERE WOULD
HAVE BEEN NO QUARRELS AMONG THEM IF THERE HAD BEEN NO SUCH
DIFFERENCES WOULD THERE NOW
EUTHYPHRO YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
SOCRATES DOES NOT EVERY MAN LOVE THAT WHICH HE DEEMS NOBLE AND JUST AND
GOOD AND HATE THE OPPOSITE OF THEM
EUTHYPHRO VERY TRUE
SOCRATES BUT AS YOU SAY PEOPLE REGARD THE SAME THINGS SOME AS JUST
AND OTHERS AS UNJUST ABOUT THESE THEY DISPUTE AND SO THERE ARISE WARS
AND FIGHTINGS AMONG THEM
EUTHYPHRO VERY TRUE
SOCRATES THEN THE SAME THINGS ARE HATED BY THE GODS AND LOVED BY THE
GODS AND ARE BOTH HATEFUL AND DEAR TO THEM
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES AND UPON THIS VIEW THE SAME THINGS EUTHYPHRO WILL BE PIOUS
AND ALSO IMPIOUS
EUTHYPHRO SO I SHOULD SUPPOSE
SOCRATES THEN MY FRIEND I REMARK WITH SURPRISE THAT YOU HAVE NOT
ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHICH I ASKED
FOR I CERTAINLY DID NOT ASK YOU
TO TELL ME WHAT ACTION IS BOTH PIOUS AND IMPIOUS BUT NOW IT WOULD SEEM
THAT WHAT IS LOVED BY THE GODS IS ALSO HATED BY THEM
AND THEREFORE
EUTHYPHRO IN THUS CHASTISING YOUR FATHER YOU MAY VERY LIKELY BE DOING
WHAT IS AGREEABLE TO ZEUS BUT DISAGREEABLE TO CRONOS OR URANUS AND WHAT
IS ACCEPTABLE TO HEPHAESTUS BUT UNACCEPTABLE TO HERE AND THERE MAY BE
OTHER GODS WHO HAVE SIMILAR DIFFERENCES OF OPINION
EUTHYPHRO BUT I BELIEVE SOCRATES THAT ALL THE GODS WOULD BE AGREED AS
TO THE PROPRIETY OF PUNISHING A MURDERER THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE
OF OPINION ABOUT THAT
SOCRATES WELL BUT SPEAKING OF MEN EUTHYPHRO DID YOU EVER HEAR ANY
ONE ARGUING THAT A MURDERER OR ANY SORT OF EVIL DOER OUGHT TO BE LET
OFF
EUTHYPHRO I SHOULD RATHER SAY THAT THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH THEY
ARE ALWAYS ARGUING ESPECIALLY IN COURTS OF LAW THEY COMMIT ALL SORTS
OF CRIMES AND THERE IS NOTHING WHICH THEY WILL NOT DO OR SAY IN THEIR
OWN DEFENCE
SOCRATES BUT DO THEY ADMIT THEIR GUILT EUTHYPHRO AND YET SAY THAT
THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE PUNISHED
EUTHYPHRO NO THEY DO NOT
SOCRATES THEN THERE ARE SOME THINGS WHICH THEY DO NOT VENTURE TO SAY
AND DO FOR THEY DO NOT VENTURE TO ARGUE THAT THE GUILTY ARE TO BE
UNPUNISHED BUT THEY DENY THEIR GUILT DO THEY NOT
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES THEN THEY DO NOT ARGUE THAT THE EVIL DOER SHOULD NOT BE
PUNISHED BUT THEY ARGUE ABOUT THE FACT OF WHO THE EVIL DOER IS AND
WHAT HE DID AND WHEN
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES AND THE GODS ARE IN THE SAME CASE IF AS YOU ASSERT THEY
QUARREL ABOUT JUST AND UNJUST AND SOME OF THEM SAY WHILE OTHERS DENY
THAT INJUSTICE IS DONE AMONG THEM
FOR SURELY NEITHER GOD NOR MAN WILL
EVER VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE DOER OF INJUSTICE IS NOT TO BE PUNISHED
EUTHYPHRO THAT IS TRUE SOCRATES IN THE MAIN
SOCRATES BUT THEY JOIN ISSUE ABOUT THE PARTICULARS GODS AND MEN ALIKE
AND IF THEY DISPUTE AT ALL THEY DISPUTE ABOUT SOME ACT WHICH IS CALLED
IN QUESTION AND WHICH BY SOME IS AFFIRMED TO BE JUST BY OTHERS TO BE
UNJUST
IS NOT THAT TRUE
EUTHYPHRO QUITE TRUE
SOCRATES WELL THEN MY DEAR FRIEND EUTHYPHRO DO TELL ME FOR MY BETTER
INSTRUCTION AND INFORMATION WHAT PROOF HAVE YOU THAT IN THE OPINION OF
ALL THE GODS A SERVANT WHO IS GUILTY OF MURDER AND IS PUT IN CHAINS BY
THE MASTER OF THE DEAD MAN AND DIES BECAUSE HE IS PUT IN CHAINS BEFORE
HE WHO BOUND HIM CAN LEARN FROM THE INTERPRETERS OF THE GODS WHAT HE
OUGHT TO DO WITH HIM DIES UNJUSTLY AND THAT ON BEHALF OF SUCH AN ONE
A SON OUGHT TO PROCEED AGAINST HIS FATHER AND ACCUSE HIM OF MURDER
HOW
WOULD YOU SHOW THAT ALL THE GODS ABSOLUTELY AGREE IN APPROVING OF HIS
ACT PROVE TO ME THAT THEY DO AND I WILL APPLAUD YOUR WISDOM AS LONG AS
I LIVE
EUTHYPHRO IT WILL BE A DIFFICULT TASK BUT I COULD MAKE THE MATTER VERY
CLEAR INDEED TO YOU
SOCRATES I UNDERSTAND YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT I AM NOT SO QUICK OF
APPREHENSION AS THE JUDGES FOR TO THEM YOU WILL BE SURE TO PROVE THAT
THE ACT IS UNJUST AND HATEFUL TO THE GODS
EUTHYPHRO YES INDEED SOCRATES AT LEAST IF THEY WILL LISTEN TO ME
SOCRATES BUT THEY WILL BE SURE TO LISTEN IF THEY FIND THAT YOU ARE A
GOOD SPEAKER
THERE WAS A NOTION THAT CAME INTO MY MIND WHILE YOU WERE
SPEAKING I SAID TO MYSELF 'WELL AND WHAT IF EUTHYPHRO DOES PROVE TO
ME THAT ALL THE GODS REGARDED THE DEATH OF THE SERF AS UNJUST HOW DO I
KNOW ANYTHING MORE OF THE NATURE OF PIETY AND IMPIETY FOR GRANTING THAT
THIS ACTION MAY BE HATEFUL TO THE GODS STILL PIETY AND IMPIETY ARE NOT
ADEQUATELY DEFINED BY THESE DISTINCTIONS FOR THAT WHICH IS HATEFUL
TO THE GODS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ALSO PLEASING AND DEAR TO THEM AND
THEREFORE EUTHYPHRO I DO NOT ASK YOU TO PROVE THIS I WILL SUPPOSE IF
YOU LIKE THAT ALL THE GODS CONDEMN AND ABOMINATE SUCH AN ACTION
BUT I
WILL AMEND THE DEFINITION SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT WHAT ALL THE GODS HATE
IS IMPIOUS AND WHAT THEY LOVE PIOUS OR HOLY AND WHAT SOME OF THEM
LOVE AND OTHERS HATE IS BOTH OR NEITHER
SHALL THIS BE OUR DEFINITION OF
PIETY AND IMPIETY
EUTHYPHRO WHY NOT SOCRATES
SOCRATES WHY NOT CERTAINLY AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED EUTHYPHRO THERE
IS NO REASON WHY NOT
BUT WHETHER THIS ADMISSION WILL GREATLY ASSIST YOU
IN THE TASK OF INSTRUCTING ME AS YOU PROMISED IS A MATTER FOR YOU TO
CONSIDER
EUTHYPHRO YES I SHOULD SAY THAT WHAT ALL THE GODS LOVE IS PIOUS AND
HOLY AND THE OPPOSITE WHICH THEY ALL HATE IMPIOUS
SOCRATES OUGHT WE TO ENQUIRE INTO THE TRUTH OF THIS EUTHYPHRO OR
SIMPLY TO ACCEPT THE MERE STATEMENT ON OUR OWN AUTHORITY AND THAT OF
OTHERS WHAT DO YOU SAY
EUTHYPHRO WE SHOULD ENQUIRE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE STATEMENT WILL
STAND THE TEST OF ENQUIRY
SOCRATES WE SHALL KNOW BETTER MY GOOD FRIEND IN A LITTLE WHILE
THE
POINT WHICH I SHOULD FIRST WISH TO UNDERSTAND IS WHETHER THE PIOUS OR
HOLY IS BELOVED BY THE GODS BECAUSE IT IS HOLY OR HOLY BECAUSE IT IS
BELOVED OF THE GODS
EUTHYPHRO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR MEANING SOCRATES
SOCRATES I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN WE SPEAK OF CARRYING AND WE
SPEAK OF BEING CARRIED OF LEADING AND BEING LED SEEING AND BEING SEEN
YOU KNOW THAT IN ALL SUCH CASES THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AND YOU KNOW ALSO
IN WHAT THE DIFFERENCE LIES
EUTHYPHRO I THINK THAT I UNDERSTAND
SOCRATES AND IS NOT THAT WHICH IS BELOVED DISTINCT FROM THAT WHICH
LOVES
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY
SOCRATES WELL AND NOW TELL ME IS THAT WHICH IS CARRIED IN THIS STATE
OF CARRYING BECAUSE IT IS CARRIED OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON
EUTHYPHRO NO THAT IS THE REASON
SOCRATES AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF WHAT IS LED AND OF WHAT IS SEEN
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES AND A THING IS NOT SEEN BECAUSE IT IS VISIBLE BUT CONVERSELY
VISIBLE BECAUSE IT IS SEEN NOR IS A THING LED BECAUSE IT IS IN THE
STATE OF BEING LED OR CARRIED BECAUSE IT IS IN THE STATE OF BEING
CARRIED BUT THE CONVERSE OF THIS
AND NOW I THINK EUTHYPHRO THAT
MY MEANING WILL BE INTELLIGIBLE AND MY MEANING IS THAT ANY STATE OF
ACTION OR PASSION IMPLIES PREVIOUS ACTION OR PASSION
IT DOES NOT BECOME
BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING BUT IT IS IN A STATE OF BECOMING BECAUSE IT
BECOMES NEITHER DOES IT SUFFER BECAUSE IT IS IN A STATE OF SUFFERING
BUT IT IS IN A STATE OF SUFFERING BECAUSE IT SUFFERS
DO YOU NOT AGREE
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES IS NOT THAT WHICH IS LOVED IN SOME STATE EITHER OF BECOMING OR
SUFFERING
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES AND THE SAME HOLDS AS IN THE PREVIOUS INSTANCES THE STATE OF
BEING LOVED FOLLOWS THE ACT OF BEING LOVED AND NOT THE ACT THE STATE
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OF PIETY EUTHYPHRO IS NOT PIETY
ACCORDING TO YOUR DEFINITION LOVED BY ALL THE GODS
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES BECAUSE IT IS PIOUS OR HOLY OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON
EUTHYPHRO NO THAT IS THE REASON
SOCRATES IT IS LOVED BECAUSE IT IS HOLY NOT HOLY BECAUSE IT IS LOVED
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES AND THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO THE GODS IS LOVED BY THEM AND IS IN
A STATE TO BE LOVED OF THEM BECAUSE IT IS LOVED OF THEM
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THEN THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO THE GODS EUTHYPHRO IS NOT HOLY
NOR IS THAT WHICH IS HOLY LOVED OF GOD AS YOU AFFIRM BUT THEY ARE TWO
DIFFERENT THINGS
EUTHYPHRO HOW DO YOU MEAN SOCRATES
SOCRATES I MEAN TO SAY THAT THE HOLY HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY US TO BE
LOVED OF GOD BECAUSE IT IS HOLY NOT TO BE HOLY BECAUSE IT IS LOVED
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES BUT THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO THE GODS IS DEAR TO THEM BECAUSE IT
IS LOVED BY THEM NOT LOVED BY THEM BECAUSE IT IS DEAR TO THEM
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES BUT FRIEND EUTHYPHRO IF THAT WHICH IS HOLY IS THE SAME WITH
THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO GOD AND IS LOVED BECAUSE IT IS HOLY THEN THAT
WHICH IS DEAR TO GOD WOULD HAVE BEEN LOVED AS BEING DEAR TO GOD BUT IF
THAT WHICH IS DEAR TO GOD IS DEAR TO HIM BECAUSE LOVED BY HIM THEN THAT
WHICH IS HOLY WOULD HAVE BEEN HOLY BECAUSE LOVED BY HIM
BUT NOW YOU SEE
THAT THE REVERSE IS THE CASE AND THAT THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM
ONE ANOTHER
FOR ONE THEOPHILES IS OF A KIND TO BE LOVED CAUSE IT
IS LOVED AND THE OTHER OSION IS LOVED BECAUSE IT IS OF A KIND TO
BE LOVED
THUS YOU APPEAR TO ME EUTHYPHRO WHEN I ASK YOU WHAT IS
THE ESSENCE OF HOLINESS TO OFFER AN ATTRIBUTE ONLY AND NOT THE
ESSENCE THE ATTRIBUTE OF BEING LOVED BY ALL THE GODS
BUT YOU STILL
REFUSE TO EXPLAIN TO ME THE NATURE OF HOLINESS
AND THEREFORE IF YOU
PLEASE I WILL ASK YOU NOT TO HIDE YOUR TREASURE BUT TO TELL ME ONCE
MORE WHAT HOLINESS OR PIETY REALLY IS WHETHER DEAR TO THE GODS OR NOT
FOR THAT IS A MATTER ABOUT WHICH WE WILL NOT QUARREL AND WHAT IS
IMPIETY
EUTHYPHRO I REALLY DO NOT KNOW SOCRATES HOW TO EXPRESS WHAT I MEAN
FOR SOMEHOW OR OTHER OUR ARGUMENTS ON WHATEVER GROUND WE REST THEM
SEEM TO TURN ROUND AND WALK AWAY FROM US
SOCRATES YOUR WORDS EUTHYPHRO ARE LIKE THE HANDIWORK OF MY ANCESTOR
DAEDALUS AND IF I WERE THE SAYER OR PROPOUNDER OF THEM YOU MIGHT SAY
THAT MY ARGUMENTS WALK AWAY AND WILL NOT REMAIN FIXED WHERE THEY ARE
PLACED BECAUSE I AM A DESCENDANT OF HIS
BUT NOW SINCE THESE NOTIONS
ARE YOUR OWN YOU MUST FIND SOME OTHER GIBE FOR THEY CERTAINLY AS YOU
YOURSELF ALLOW SHOW AN INCLINATION TO BE ON THE MOVE
EUTHYPHRO NAY SOCRATES I SHALL STILL SAY THAT YOU ARE THE DAEDALUS
WHO SETS ARGUMENTS IN MOTION NOT I CERTAINLY BUT YOU MAKE THEM
MOVE OR GO ROUND FOR THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE STIRRED AS FAR AS I AM
CONCERNED
SOCRATES THEN I MUST BE A GREATER THAN DAEDALUS FOR WHEREAS HE ONLY
MADE HIS OWN INVENTIONS TO MOVE I MOVE THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL
AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT I WOULD RATHER NOT
FOR I WOULD GIVE THE
WISDOM OF DAEDALUS AND THE WEALTH OF TANTALUS TO BE ABLE TO DETAIN
THEM AND KEEP THEM FIXED
BUT ENOUGH OF THIS
AS I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE
LAZY I WILL MYSELF ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW YOU HOW YOU MIGHT INSTRUCT ME IN
THE NATURE OF PIETY AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT GRUDGE YOUR LABOUR
TELL ME THEN IS NOT THAT WHICH IS PIOUS NECESSARILY JUST
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES AND IS THEN ALL WHICH IS JUST PIOUS OR IS THAT WHICH IS
PIOUS ALL JUST BUT THAT WHICH IS JUST ONLY IN PART AND NOT ALL PIOUS
EUTHYPHRO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SOCRATES
SOCRATES AND YET I KNOW THAT YOU ARE AS MUCH WISER THAN I AM AS YOU
ARE YOUNGER
BUT AS I WAS SAYING REVERED FRIEND THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR
WISDOM MAKES YOU LAZY
PLEASE TO EXERT YOURSELF FOR THERE IS NO
REAL DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING ME
WHAT I MEAN I MAY EXPLAIN BY AN
ILLUSTRATION OF WHAT I DO NOT MEAN
THE POET STASINUS SINGS
'OF ZEUS THE AUTHOR AND CREATOR OF ALL THESE THINGS YOU WILL NOT TELL
FOR WHERE THERE IS FEAR THERE IS ALSO REVERENCE
NOW I DISAGREE WITH THIS POET
SHALL I TELL YOU IN WHAT RESPECT
EUTHYPHRO BY ALL MEANS
SOCRATES I SHOULD NOT SAY THAT WHERE THERE IS FEAR THERE IS ALSO
REVERENCE FOR I AM SURE THAT MANY PERSONS FEAR POVERTY AND DISEASE AND
THE LIKE EVILS BUT I DO NOT PERCEIVE THAT THEY REVERENCE THE OBJECTS OF
THEIR FEAR
EUTHYPHRO VERY TRUE
SOCRATES BUT WHERE REVERENCE IS THERE IS FEAR FOR HE WHO HAS A
FEELING OF REVERENCE AND SHAME ABOUT THE COMMISSION OF ANY ACTION FEARS
AND IS AFRAID OF AN ILL REPUTATION
EUTHYPHRO NO DOUBT
SOCRATES THEN WE ARE WRONG IN SAYING THAT WHERE THERE IS FEAR THERE
IS ALSO REVERENCE AND WE SHOULD SAY WHERE THERE IS REVERENCE THERE IS
ALSO FEAR
BUT THERE IS NOT ALWAYS REVERENCE WHERE THERE IS FEAR FOR
FEAR IS A MORE EXTENDED NOTION AND REVERENCE IS A PART OF FEAR JUST AS
THE ODD IS A PART OF NUMBER AND NUMBER IS A MORE EXTENDED NOTION THAN
THE ODD
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU FOLLOW ME NOW
EUTHYPHRO QUITE WELL
SOCRATES THAT WAS THE SORT OF QUESTION WHICH I MEANT TO RAISE WHEN
I ASKED WHETHER THE JUST IS ALWAYS THE PIOUS OR THE PIOUS ALWAYS THE
JUST AND WHETHER THERE MAY NOT BE JUSTICE WHERE THERE IS NOT PIETY FOR
JUSTICE IS THE MORE EXTENDED NOTION OF WHICH PIETY IS ONLY A PART
DO
YOU DISSENT
EUTHYPHRO NO I THINK THAT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT
SOCRATES THEN IF PIETY IS A PART OF JUSTICE I SUPPOSE THAT WE SHOULD
ENQUIRE WHAT PART IF YOU HAD PURSUED THE ENQUIRY IN THE PREVIOUS CASES
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAD ASKED ME WHAT IS AN EVEN NUMBER AND WHAT PART
OF NUMBER THE EVEN IS I SHOULD HAVE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN REPLYING
A NUMBER WHICH REPRESENTS A FIGURE HAVING TWO EQUAL SIDES
DO YOU NOT
AGREE
EUTHYPHRO YES I QUITE AGREE
SOCRATES IN LIKE MANNER I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT PART OF JUSTICE
IS PIETY OR HOLINESS THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO TELL MELETUS NOT TO DO ME
INJUSTICE OR INDICT ME FOR IMPIETY AS I AM NOW ADEQUATELY INSTRUCTED
BY YOU IN THE NATURE OF PIETY OR HOLINESS AND THEIR OPPOSITES
EUTHYPHRO PIETY OR HOLINESS SOCRATES APPEARS TO ME TO BE THAT PART OF
JUSTICE WHICH ATTENDS TO THE GODS AS THERE IS THE OTHER PART OF JUSTICE
WHICH ATTENDS TO MEN
SOCRATES THAT IS GOOD EUTHYPHRO YET STILL THERE IS A LITTLE POINT
ABOUT WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE FURTHER INFORMATION WHAT IS THE
MEANING OF 'ATTENTION' FOR ATTENTION CAN HARDLY BE USED IN THE SAME
SENSE WHEN APPLIED TO THE GODS AS WHEN APPLIED TO OTHER THINGS
FOR
INSTANCE HORSES ARE SAID TO REQUIRE ATTENTION AND NOT EVERY PERSON IS
ABLE TO ATTEND TO THEM BUT ONLY A PERSON SKILLED IN HORSEMANSHIP
IS IT
NOT SO
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY
SOCRATES I SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT THE ART OF HORSEMANSHIP IS THE ART OF
ATTENDING TO HORSES
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES NOR IS EVERY ONE QUALIFIED TO ATTEND TO DOGS BUT ONLY THE
HUNTSMAN
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES AND I SHOULD ALSO CONCEIVE THAT THE ART OF THE HUNTSMAN IS THE
ART OF ATTENDING TO DOGS
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES AS THE ART OF THE OXHERD IS THE ART OF ATTENDING TO OXEN
EUTHYPHRO VERY TRUE
SOCRATES IN LIKE MANNER HOLINESS OR PIETY IS THE ART OF ATTENDING TO
THE GODS THAT WOULD BE YOUR MEANING EUTHYPHRO
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES AND IS NOT ATTENTION ALWAYS DESIGNED FOR THE GOOD OR BENEFIT
OF THAT TO WHICH THE ATTENTION IS GIVEN AS IN THE CASE OF HORSES
YOU MAY OBSERVE THAT WHEN ATTENDED TO BY THE HORSEMAN'S ART THEY ARE
BENEFITED AND IMPROVED ARE THEY NOT
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES AS THE DOGS ARE BENEFITED BY THE HUNTSMAN'S ART AND THE OXEN
BY THE ART OF THE OXHERD AND ALL OTHER THINGS ARE TENDED OR ATTENDED
FOR THEIR GOOD AND NOT FOR THEIR HURT
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY NOT FOR THEIR HURT
SOCRATES BUT FOR THEIR GOOD
EUTHYPHRO OF COURSE
SOCRATES AND DOES PIETY OR HOLINESS WHICH HAS BEEN DEFINED TO BE THE
ART OF ATTENDING TO THE GODS BENEFIT OR IMPROVE THEM WOULD YOU SAY
THAT WHEN YOU DO A HOLY ACT YOU MAKE ANY OF THE GODS BETTER
EUTHYPHRO NO NO THAT WAS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I MEANT
SOCRATES AND I EUTHYPHRO NEVER SUPPOSED THAT YOU DID
I ASKED YOU THE
QUESTION ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE ATTENTION BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT YOU
DID NOT
EUTHYPHRO YOU DO ME JUSTICE SOCRATES THAT IS NOT THE SORT OF
ATTENTION WHICH I MEAN
SOCRATES GOOD BUT I MUST STILL ASK WHAT IS THIS ATTENTION TO THE GODS
WHICH IS CALLED PIETY
EUTHYPHRO IT IS SUCH SOCRATES AS SERVANTS SHOW TO THEIR MASTERS
SOCRATES I UNDERSTAND A SORT OF MINISTRATION TO THE GODS
EUTHYPHRO EXACTLY
SOCRATES MEDICINE IS ALSO A SORT OF MINISTRATION OR SERVICE HAVING IN
VIEW THE ATTAINMENT OF SOME OBJECT WOULD YOU NOT SAY OF HEALTH
EUTHYPHRO I SHOULD
SOCRATES AGAIN THERE IS AN ART WHICH MINISTERS TO THE SHIP BUILDER
WITH A VIEW TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SOME RESULT
EUTHYPHRO YES SOCRATES WITH A VIEW TO THE BUILDING OF A SHIP
SOCRATES AS THERE IS AN ART WHICH MINISTERS TO THE HOUSE BUILDER WITH A
VIEW TO THE BUILDING OF A HOUSE
EUTHYPHRO YES
SOCRATES AND NOW TELL ME MY GOOD FRIEND ABOUT THE ART WHICH MINISTERS
TO THE GODS WHAT WORK DOES THAT HELP TO ACCOMPLISH FOR YOU MUST SURELY
KNOW IF AS YOU SAY YOU ARE OF ALL MEN LIVING THE ONE WHO IS BEST
INSTRUCTED IN RELIGION
EUTHYPHRO AND I SPEAK THE TRUTH SOCRATES
SOCRATES TELL ME THEN OH TELL ME WHAT IS THAT FAIR WORK WHICH THE
GODS DO BY THE HELP OF OUR MINISTRATIONS
EUTHYPHRO MANY AND FAIR SOCRATES ARE THE WORKS WHICH THEY DO
SOCRATES WHY MY FRIEND AND SO ARE THOSE OF A GENERAL
BUT THE CHIEF
OF THEM IS EASILY TOLD
WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT VICTORY IN WAR IS THE
CHIEF OF THEM
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY
SOCRATES MANY AND FAIR TOO ARE THE WORKS OF THE HUSBANDMAN IF I
AM NOT MISTAKEN BUT HIS CHIEF WORK IS THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD FROM THE
EARTH
EUTHYPHRO EXACTLY
SOCRATES AND OF THE MANY AND FAIR THINGS DONE BY THE GODS WHICH IS THE
CHIEF OR PRINCIPAL ONE
EUTHYPHRO I HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY SOCRATES THAT TO LEARN ALL THESE
THINGS ACCURATELY WILL BE VERY TIRESOME
LET ME SIMPLY SAY THAT PIETY OR
HOLINESS IS LEARNING HOW TO PLEASE THE GODS IN WORD AND DEED BY PRAYERS
AND SACRIFICES
SUCH PIETY IS THE SALVATION OF FAMILIES AND STATES
JUST AS THE IMPIOUS WHICH IS UNPLEASING TO THE GODS IS THEIR RUIN AND
DESTRUCTION
SOCRATES I THINK THAT YOU COULD HAVE ANSWERED IN MUCH FEWER WORDS THE
CHIEF QUESTION WHICH I ASKED EUTHYPHRO IF YOU HAD CHOSEN
BUT I SEE
PLAINLY THAT YOU ARE NOT DISPOSED TO INSTRUCT ME CLEARLY NOT ELSE WHY
WHEN WE REACHED THE POINT DID YOU TURN ASIDE HAD YOU ONLY ANSWERED
ME I SHOULD HAVE TRULY LEARNED OF YOU BY THIS TIME THE NATURE OF
PIETY
NOW AS THE ASKER OF A QUESTION IS NECESSARILY DEPENDENT ON THE
ANSWERER WHITHER HE LEADS I MUST FOLLOW AND CAN ONLY ASK AGAIN WHAT
IS THE PIOUS AND WHAT IS PIETY DO YOU MEAN THAT THEY ARE A SORT OF
SCIENCE OF PRAYING AND SACRIFICING
EUTHYPHRO YES I DO
SOCRATES AND SACRIFICING IS GIVING TO THE GODS AND PRAYER IS ASKING OF
THE GODS
EUTHYPHRO YES SOCRATES
SOCRATES UPON THIS VIEW THEN PIETY IS A SCIENCE OF ASKING AND GIVING
EUTHYPHRO YOU UNDERSTAND ME CAPITALLY SOCRATES
SOCRATES YES MY FRIEND THE REASON IS THAT I AM A VOTARY OF YOUR
SCIENCE AND GIVE MY MIND TO IT AND THEREFORE NOTHING WHICH YOU SAY
WILL BE THROWN AWAY UPON ME
PLEASE THEN TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE NATURE
OF THIS SERVICE TO THE GODS DO YOU MEAN THAT WE PREFER REQUESTS AND
GIVE GIFTS TO THEM
EUTHYPHRO YES I DO
SOCRATES IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY OF ASKING TO ASK OF THEM WHAT WE WANT
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND THE RIGHT WAY OF GIVING IS TO GIVE TO THEM IN RETURN WHAT
THEY WANT OF US
THERE WOULD BE NO MEANING IN AN ART WHICH GIVES TO ANY
ONE THAT WHICH HE DOES NOT WANT
EUTHYPHRO VERY TRUE SOCRATES
SOCRATES THEN PIETY EUTHYPHRO IS AN ART WHICH GODS AND MEN HAVE OF
DOING BUSINESS WITH ONE ANOTHER
EUTHYPHRO THAT IS AN EXPRESSION WHICH YOU MAY USE IF YOU LIKE
SOCRATES BUT I HAVE NO PARTICULAR LIKING FOR ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH
I
WISH HOWEVER THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME WHAT BENEFIT ACCRUES TO THE GODS
FROM OUR GIFTS
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT WHAT THEY GIVE TO US FOR THERE
IS NO GOOD THING WHICH THEY DO NOT GIVE BUT HOW WE CAN GIVE ANY GOOD
THING TO THEM IN RETURN IS FAR FROM BEING EQUALLY CLEAR
IF THEY GIVE
EVERYTHING AND WE GIVE NOTHING THAT MUST BE AN AFFAIR OF BUSINESS IN
WHICH WE HAVE VERY GREATLY THE ADVANTAGE OF THEM
EUTHYPHRO AND DO YOU IMAGINE SOCRATES THAT ANY BENEFIT ACCRUES TO THE
GODS FROM OUR GIFTS
SOCRATES BUT IF NOT EUTHYPHRO WHAT IS THE MEANING OF GIFTS WHICH ARE
CONFERRED BY US UPON THE GODS
EUTHYPHRO WHAT ELSE BUT TRIBUTES OF HONOUR AND AS I WAS JUST NOW
SAYING WHAT PLEASES THEM
SOCRATES PIETY THEN IS PLEASING TO THE GODS BUT NOT BENEFICIAL OR
DEAR TO THEM
EUTHYPHRO I SHOULD SAY THAT NOTHING COULD BE DEARER
SOCRATES THEN ONCE MORE THE ASSERTION IS REPEATED THAT PIETY IS DEAR TO
THE GODS
EUTHYPHRO CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND WHEN YOU SAY THIS CAN YOU WONDER AT YOUR WORDS NOT
STANDING FIRM BUT WALKING AWAY WILL YOU ACCUSE ME OF BEING THE
DAEDALUS WHO MAKES THEM WALK AWAY NOT PERCEIVING THAT THERE IS ANOTHER
AND FAR GREATER ARTIST THAN DAEDALUS WHO MAKES THEM GO ROUND IN A
CIRCLE AND HE IS YOURSELF FOR THE ARGUMENT AS YOU WILL PERCEIVE
COMES ROUND TO THE SAME POINT
WERE WE NOT SAYING THAT THE HOLY OR
PIOUS WAS NOT THE SAME WITH THAT WHICH IS LOVED OF THE GODS HAVE YOU
FORGOTTEN
EUTHYPHRO I QUITE REMEMBER
SOCRATES AND ARE YOU NOT SAYING THAT WHAT IS LOVED OF THE GODS IS HOLY
AND IS NOT THIS THE SAME AS WHAT IS DEAR TO THEM DO YOU SEE
EUTHYPHRO TRUE
SOCRATES THEN EITHER WE WERE WRONG IN OUR FORMER ASSERTION OR IF WE
WERE RIGHT THEN WE ARE WRONG NOW
EUTHYPHRO ONE OF THE TWO MUST BE TRUE
SOCRATES THEN WE MUST BEGIN AGAIN AND ASK WHAT IS PIETY THAT IS AN
ENQUIRY WHICH I SHALL NEVER BE WEARY OF PURSUING AS FAR AS IN ME LIES
AND I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO SCORN ME BUT TO APPLY YOUR MIND TO THE UTMOST
AND TELL ME THE TRUTH
FOR IF ANY MAN KNOWS YOU ARE HE AND THEREFORE
I MUST DETAIN YOU LIKE PROTEUS UNTIL YOU TELL
IF YOU HAD NOT
CERTAINLY KNOWN THE NATURE OF PIETY AND IMPIETY I AM CONFIDENT THAT
YOU WOULD NEVER ON BEHALF OF A SERF HAVE CHARGED YOUR AGED FATHER WITH
MURDER
YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RUN SUCH A RISK OF DOING WRONG IN THE SIGHT
OF THE GODS AND YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR THE OPINIONS
OF MEN
I AM SURE THEREFORE THAT YOU KNOW THE NATURE OF PIETY AND
IMPIETY
SPEAK OUT THEN MY DEAR EUTHYPHRO AND DO NOT HIDE YOUR
KNOWLEDGE
EUTHYPHRO ANOTHER TIME SOCRATES FOR I AM IN A HURRY AND MUST GO NOW
SOCRATES ALAS MY COMPANION AND WILL YOU LEAVE ME IN DESPAIR I WAS
HOPING THAT YOU WOULD INSTRUCT ME IN THE NATURE OF PIETY AND IMPIETY
AND THEN I MIGHT HAVE CLEARED MYSELF OF MELETUS AND HIS INDICTMENT
I
WOULD HAVE TOLD HIM THAT I HAD BEEN ENLIGHTENED BY EUTHYPHRO AND HAD
GIVEN UP RASH INNOVATIONS AND SPECULATIONS IN WHICH I INDULGED ONLY
THROUGH IGNORANCE AND THAT NOW I AM ABOUT TO LEAD A BETTER LIFE

APOLOGY
BY PLATO
TRANSLATED BY BENJAMIN JOWETT
INTRODUCTION
IN WHAT RELATION THE APOLOGY OF PLATO STANDS TO THE REAL DEFENCE OF
SOCRATES THERE ARE NO MEANS OF DETERMINING
IT CERTAINLY AGREES IN
TONE AND CHARACTER WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF XENOPHON WHO SAYS IN THE
MEMORABILIA THAT SOCRATES MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED 'IF IN ANY MODERATE
DEGREE HE WOULD HAVE CONCILIATED THE FAVOUR OF THE DICASTS AND WHO
INFORMS US IN ANOTHER PASSAGE ON THE TESTIMONY OF HERMOGENES THE
FRIEND OF SOCRATES THAT HE HAD NO WISH TO LIVE AND THAT THE DIVINE
SIGN REFUSED TO ALLOW HIM TO PREPARE A DEFENCE AND ALSO THAT SOCRATES
HIMSELF DECLARED THIS TO BE UNNECESSARY ON THE GROUND THAT ALL HIS LIFE
LONG HE HAD BEEN PREPARING AGAINST THAT HOUR
FOR THE SPEECH BREATHES
THROUGHOUT A SPIRIT OF DEFIANCE UT NON SUPPLEX AUT REUS SED MAGISTER
AUT DOMINUS VIDERETUR ESSE JUDICUM' CIC
DE ORAT AND THE LOOSE AND
DESULTORY STYLE IS AN IMITATION OF THE 'ACCUSTOMED MANNER' IN
WHICH SOCRATES SPOKE IN 'THE AGORA AND AMONG THE TABLES OF THE
MONEY CHANGERS THE ALLUSION IN THE CRITO MAY PERHAPS BE ADDUCED AS A
FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE LITERAL ACCURACY OF SOME PARTS
BUT IN THE
MAIN IT MUST BE REGARDED AS THE IDEAL OF SOCRATES ACCORDING TO PLATO'S
CONCEPTION OF HIM APPEARING IN THE GREATEST AND MOST PUBLIC SCENE OF
HIS LIFE AND IN THE HEIGHT OF HIS TRIUMPH WHEN HE IS WEAKEST AND YET
HIS MASTERY OVER MANKIND IS GREATEST AND HIS HABITUAL IRONY ACQUIRES A
NEW MEANING AND A SORT OF TRAGIC PATHOS IN THE FACE OF DEATH
THE FACTS
OF HIS LIFE ARE SUMMED UP AND THE FEATURES OF HIS CHARACTER ARE BROUGHT
OUT AS IF BY ACCIDENT IN THE COURSE OF THE DEFENCE
THE CONVERSATIONAL
MANNER THE SEEMING WANT OF ARRANGEMENT THE IRONICAL SIMPLICITY ARE
FOUND TO RESULT IN A PERFECT WORK OF ART WHICH IS THE PORTRAIT OF
SOCRATES
YET SOME OF THE TOPICS MAY HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY USED BY SOCRATES AND
THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS VERY WORDS MAY HAVE RUNG IN THE EARS OF HIS
DISCIPLE
THE APOLOGY OF PLATO MAY BE COMPARED GENERALLY WITH THOSE
SPEECHES OF THUCYDIDES IN WHICH HE HAS EMBODIED HIS CONCEPTION OF THE
LOFTY CHARACTER AND POLICY OF THE GREAT PERICLES AND WHICH AT THE SAME
TIME FURNISH A COMMENTARY ON THE SITUATION OF AFFAIRS FROM THE POINT OF
VIEW OF THE HISTORIAN
SO IN THE APOLOGY THERE IS AN IDEAL RATHER THAN A
LITERAL TRUTH MUCH IS SAID WHICH WAS NOT SAID AND IS ONLY PLATO'S VIEW
OF THE SITUATION
PLATO WAS NOT LIKE XENOPHON A CHRONICLER OF FACTS
HE DOES NOT APPEAR IN ANY OF HIS WRITINGS TO HAVE AIMED AT LITERAL
ACCURACY
HE IS NOT THEREFORE TO BE SUPPLEMENTED FROM THE MEMORABILIA
AND SYMPOSIUM OF XENOPHON WHO BELONGS TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CLASS OF
WRITERS
THE APOLOGY OF PLATO IS NOT THE REPORT OF WHAT SOCRATES SAID
BUT AN ELABORATE COMPOSITION QUITE AS MUCH SO IN FACT AS ONE OF THE
DIALOGUES
AND WE MAY PERHAPS EVEN INDULGE IN THE FANCY THAT THE ACTUAL
DEFENCE OF SOCRATES WAS AS MUCH GREATER THAN THE PLATONIC DEFENCE AS THE
MASTER WAS GREATER THAN THE DISCIPLE
BUT IN ANY CASE SOME OF THE WORDS
USED BY HIM MUST HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED AND SOME OF THE FACTS RECORDED
MUST HAVE ACTUALLY OCCURRED
IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT PLATO IS SAID TO
HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT THE DEFENCE APOL AS HE IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE
BEEN ABSENT AT THE LAST SCENE IN THE PHAEDO
IS IT FANCIFUL TO SUPPOSE
THAT HE MEANT TO GIVE THE STAMP OF AUTHENTICITY TO THE ONE AND NOT TO
THE OTHER ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT THESE TWO PASSAGES ARE THE
ONLY ONES IN WHICH PLATO MAKES MENTION OF HIMSELF
THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
PLATO WAS TO BE ONE OF HIS SURETIES FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE FINE WHICH HE
PROPOSED HAS THE APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
MORE SUSPICIOUS IS THE STATEMENT
THAT SOCRATES RECEIVED THE FIRST IMPULSE TO HIS FAVOURITE CALLING OF
CROSS EXAMINING THE WORLD FROM THE ORACLE OF DELPHI FOR HE MUST ALREADY
HAVE BEEN FAMOUS BEFORE CHAEREPHON WENT TO CONSULT THE ORACLE RIDDELL
AND THE STORY IS OF A KIND WHICH IS VERY LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN INVENTED
ON THE WHOLE WE ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE APOLOGY IS TRUE TO THE
CHARACTER OF SOCRATES BUT WE CANNOT SHOW THAT ANY SINGLE SENTENCE IN IT
WAS ACTUALLY SPOKEN BY HIM
IT BREATHES THE SPIRIT OF SOCRATES BUT HAS
BEEN CAST ANEW IN THE MOULD OF PLATO
THERE IS NOT MUCH IN THE OTHER DIALOGUES WHICH CAN BE COMPARED WITH THE
APOLOGY
THE SAME RECOLLECTION OF HIS MASTER MAY HAVE BEEN PRESENT
TO THE MIND OF PLATO WHEN DEPICTING THE SUFFERINGS OF THE JUST IN THE
REPUBLIC
THE CRITO MAY ALSO BE REGARDED AS A SORT OF APPENDAGE TO THE
APOLOGY IN WHICH SOCRATES WHO HAS DEFIED THE JUDGES IS NEVERTHELESS
REPRESENTED AS SCRUPULOUSLY OBEDIENT TO THE LAWS
THE IDEALIZATION
OF THE SUFFERER IS CARRIED STILL FURTHER IN THE GORGIAS IN WHICH THE
THESIS IS MAINTAINED THAT 'TO SUFFER IS BETTER THAN TO DO EVIL AND
THE ART OF RHETORIC IS DESCRIBED AS ONLY USEFUL FOR THE PURPOSE OF
SELF ACCUSATION
THE PARALLELISMS WHICH OCCUR IN THE SO CALLED APOLOGY
OF XENOPHON ARE NOT WORTH NOTICING BECAUSE THE WRITING IN WHICH THEY
ARE CONTAINED IS MANIFESTLY SPURIOUS
THE STATEMENTS OF THE MEMORABILIA
RESPECTING THE TRIAL AND DEATH OF SOCRATES AGREE GENERALLY WITH PLATO
BUT THEY HAVE LOST THE FLAVOUR OF SOCRATIC IRONY IN THE NARRATIVE OF
XENOPHON
THE APOLOGY OR PLATONIC DEFENCE OF SOCRATES IS DIVIDED INTO THREE
PARTS 1ST
THE DEFENCE PROPERLY SO CALLED 2ND
THE SHORTER ADDRESS IN
MITIGATION OF THE PENALTY 3RD
THE LAST WORDS OF PROPHETIC REBUKE AND
EXHORTATION
THE FIRST PART COMMENCES WITH AN APOLOGY FOR HIS COLLOQUIAL STYLE
HE IS AS HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF RHETORIC AND KNOWS OF
NO RHETORIC BUT TRUTH HE WILL NOT FALSIFY HIS CHARACTER BY MAKING A
SPEECH
THEN HE PROCEEDS TO DIVIDE HIS ACCUSERS INTO TWO CLASSES FIRST
THERE IS THE NAMELESS ACCUSER PUBLIC OPINION
ALL THE WORLD FROM THEIR
EARLIEST YEARS HAD HEARD THAT HE WAS A CORRUPTER OF YOUTH AND HAD SEEN
HIM CARICATURED IN THE CLOUDS OF ARISTOPHANES
SECONDLY THERE ARE
THE PROFESSED ACCUSERS WHO ARE BUT THE MOUTH PIECE OF THE OTHERS
THE
ACCUSATIONS OF BOTH MIGHT BE SUMMED UP IN A FORMULA
THE FIRST SAY
'SOCRATES IS AN EVIL DOER AND A CURIOUS PERSON SEARCHING INTO THINGS
UNDER THE EARTH AND ABOVE THE HEAVEN AND MAKING THE WORSE APPEAR THE
BETTER CAUSE AND TEACHING ALL THIS TO OTHERS THE SECOND 'SOCRATES IS
AN EVIL DOER AND CORRUPTER OF THE YOUTH WHO DOES NOT RECEIVE THE GODS
WHOM THE STATE RECEIVES BUT INTRODUCES OTHER NEW DIVINITIES THESE
LAST WORDS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN THE ACTUAL INDICTMENT COMPARE XEN
MEM AND THE PREVIOUS FORMULA WHICH IS A SUMMARY OF PUBLIC OPINION
ASSUMES THE SAME LEGAL STYLE
THE ANSWER BEGINS BY CLEARING UP A CONFUSION
IN THE REPRESENTATIONS
OF THE COMIC POETS AND IN THE OPINION OF THE MULTITUDE HE HAD BEEN
IDENTIFIED WITH THE TEACHERS OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND WITH THE SOPHISTS
BUT THIS WAS AN ERROR
FOR BOTH OF THEM HE PROFESSES A RESPECT IN THE
OPEN COURT WHICH CONTRASTS WITH HIS MANNER OF SPEAKING ABOUT THEM IN
OTHER PLACES
COMPARE FOR ANAXAGORAS PHAEDO LAWS FOR THE SOPHISTS
MENO REPUBLIC TIM THEAET SOPH ETC BUT AT THE SAME TIME
HE SHOWS THAT HE IS NOT ONE OF THEM
OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY HE KNOWS
NOTHING NOT THAT HE DESPISES SUCH PURSUITS BUT THE FACT IS THAT HE IS
IGNORANT OF THEM AND NEVER SAYS A WORD ABOUT THEM
NOR IS HE PAID FOR
GIVING INSTRUCTION THAT IS ANOTHER MISTAKEN NOTION HE HAS NOTHING TO
TEACH
BUT HE COMMENDS EVENUS FOR TEACHING VIRTUE AT SUCH A 'MODERATE'
RATE AS FIVE MINAE
SOMETHING OF THE 'ACCUSTOMED IRONY WHICH MAY
PERHAPS BE EXPECTED TO SLEEP IN THE EAR OF THE MULTITUDE IS LURKING
HERE
HE THEN GOES ON TO EXPLAIN THE REASON WHY HE IS IN SUCH AN EVIL NAME
THAT HAD ARISEN OUT OF A PECULIAR MISSION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN UPON
HIMSELF
THE ENTHUSIASTIC CHAEREPHON PROBABLY IN ANTICIPATION OF THE
ANSWER WHICH HE RECEIVED HAD GONE TO DELPHI AND ASKED THE ORACLE IF
THERE WAS ANY MAN WISER THAN SOCRATES AND THE ANSWER WAS THAT THERE
WAS NO MAN WISER
WHAT COULD BE THE MEANING OF THIS THAT HE WHO KNEW
NOTHING AND KNEW THAT HE KNEW NOTHING SHOULD BE DECLARED BY THE ORACLE
TO BE THE WISEST OF MEN REFLECTING UPON THE ANSWER HE DETERMINED TO
REFUTE IT BY FINDING 'A WISER AND FIRST HE WENT TO THE POLITICIANS
AND THEN TO THE POETS AND THEN TO THE CRAFTSMEN BUT ALWAYS WITH THE
SAME RESULT HE FOUND THAT THEY KNEW NOTHING OR HARDLY ANYTHING MORE
THAN HIMSELF AND THAT THE LITTLE ADVANTAGE WHICH IN SOME CASES THEY
POSSESSED WAS MORE THAN COUNTER BALANCED BY THEIR CONCEIT OF KNOWLEDGE
HE KNEW NOTHING AND KNEW THAT HE KNEW NOTHING THEY KNEW LITTLE OR
NOTHING AND IMAGINED THAT THEY KNEW ALL THINGS
THUS HE HAD PASSED
HIS LIFE AS A SORT OF MISSIONARY IN DETECTING THE PRETENDED WISDOM OF
MANKIND AND THIS OCCUPATION HAD QUITE ABSORBED HIM AND TAKEN HIM AWAY
BOTH FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AFFAIRS
YOUNG MEN OF THE RICHER SORT HAD
MADE A PASTIME OF THE SAME PURSUIT 'WHICH WAS NOT UNAMUSING AND HENCE
BITTER ENMITIES HAD ARISEN THE PROFESSORS OF KNOWLEDGE HAD REVENGED
THEMSELVES BY CALLING HIM A VILLAINOUS CORRUPTER OF YOUTH AND BY
REPEATING THE COMMONPLACES ABOUT ATHEISM AND MATERIALISM AND SOPHISTRY
WHICH ARE THE STOCK ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ALL PHILOSOPHERS WHEN THERE IS
NOTHING ELSE TO BE SAID OF THEM
THE SECOND ACCUSATION HE MEETS BY INTERROGATING MELETUS WHO IS PRESENT
AND CAN BE INTERROGATED
'IF HE IS THE CORRUPTER WHO IS THE IMPROVER OF
THE CITIZENS COMPARE MENO 'ALL MEN EVERYWHERE BUT HOW ABSURD HOW
CONTRARY TO ANALOGY IS THIS HOW INCONCEIVABLE TOO THAT HE SHOULD MAKE
THE CITIZENS WORSE WHEN HE HAS TO LIVE WITH THEM
THIS SURELY CANNOT BE
INTENTIONAL AND IF UNINTENTIONAL HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED BY
MELETUS AND NOT ACCUSED IN THE COURT
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER PART OF THE INDICTMENT WHICH SAYS THAT HE TEACHES
MEN NOT TO RECEIVE THE GODS WHOM THE CITY RECEIVES AND HAS OTHER NEW
GODS
'IS THAT THE WAY IN WHICH HE IS SUPPOSED TO CORRUPT THE YOUTH
'YES IT IS 'HAS HE ONLY NEW GODS OR NONE AT ALL 'NONE AT ALL
'WHAT NOT EVEN THE SUN AND MOON 'NO WHY HE SAYS THAT THE SUN IS A
STONE AND THE MOON EARTH THAT REPLIES SOCRATES IS THE OLD CONFUSION
ABOUT ANAXAGORAS THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE ARE NOT SO IGNORANT AS TO
ATTRIBUTE TO THE INFLUENCE OF SOCRATES NOTIONS WHICH HAVE FOUND
THEIR WAY INTO THE DRAMA AND MAY BE LEARNED AT THE THEATRE
SOCRATES
UNDERTAKES TO SHOW THAT MELETUS RATHER UNJUSTIFIABLY HAS BEEN
COMPOUNDING A RIDDLE IN THIS PART OF THE INDICTMENT 'THERE ARE NO GODS
BUT SOCRATES BELIEVES IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE SONS OF GODS WHICH IS
ABSURD
LEAVING MELETUS WHO HAS HAD ENOUGH WORDS SPENT UPON HIM HE RETURNS TO
THE ORIGINAL ACCUSATION
THE QUESTION MAY BE ASKED WHY WILL HE PERSIST
IN FOLLOWING A PROFESSION WHICH LEADS HIM TO DEATH WHY BECAUSE HE
MUST REMAIN AT HIS POST WHERE THE GOD HAS PLACED HIM AS HE REMAINED
AT POTIDAEA AND AMPHIPOLIS AND DELIUM WHERE THE GENERALS PLACED HIM
BESIDES HE IS NOT SO OVERWISE AS TO IMAGINE THAT HE KNOWS WHETHER DEATH
IS A GOOD OR AN EVIL AND HE IS CERTAIN THAT DESERTION OF HIS DUTY IS
AN EVIL
ANYTUS IS QUITE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE
INDICTED HIM IF THEY MEANT TO LET HIM GO
FOR HE WILL CERTAINLY OBEY GOD
RATHER THAN MAN AND WILL CONTINUE TO PREACH TO ALL MEN OF ALL AGES THE
NECESSITY OF VIRTUE AND IMPROVEMENT AND IF THEY REFUSE TO LISTEN TO HIM
HE WILL STILL PERSEVERE AND REPROVE THEM
THIS IS HIS WAY OF CORRUPTING
THE YOUTH WHICH HE WILL NOT CEASE TO FOLLOW IN OBEDIENCE TO THE GOD
EVEN IF A THOUSAND DEATHS AWAIT HIM
HE IS DESIROUS THAT THEY SHOULD LET HIM LIVE NOT FOR HIS OWN SAKE BUT
FOR THEIRS BECAUSE HE IS THEIR HEAVEN SENT FRIEND AND THEY WILL NEVER
HAVE SUCH ANOTHER OR AS HE MAY BE LUDICROUSLY DESCRIBED HE IS THE
GADFLY WHO STIRS THE GENEROUS STEED INTO MOTION
WHY THEN HAS HE NEVER
TAKEN PART IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS BECAUSE THE FAMILIAR DIVINE VOICE HAS
HINDERED HIM IF HE HAD BEEN A PUBLIC MAN AND HAD FOUGHT FOR THE RIGHT
AS HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST THE MANY HE WOULD NOT HAVE
LIVED AND COULD THEREFORE HAVE DONE NO GOOD
TWICE IN PUBLIC MATTERS
HE HAS RISKED HIS LIFE FOR THE SAKE OF JUSTICE ONCE AT THE TRIAL OF
THE GENERALS AND AGAIN IN RESISTANCE TO THE TYRANNICAL COMMANDS OF THE
THIRTY
BUT THOUGH NOT A PUBLIC MAN HE HAS PASSED HIS DAYS IN INSTRUCTING
THE CITIZENS WITHOUT FEE OR REWARD THIS WAS HIS MISSION
WHETHER HIS
DISCIPLES HAVE TURNED OUT WELL OR ILL HE CANNOT JUSTLY BE CHARGED WITH
THE RESULT FOR HE NEVER PROMISED TO TEACH THEM ANYTHING
THEY MIGHT
COME IF THEY LIKED AND THEY MIGHT STAY AWAY IF THEY LIKED AND THEY
DID COME BECAUSE THEY FOUND AN AMUSEMENT IN HEARING THE PRETENDERS TO
WISDOM DETECTED
IF THEY HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED THEIR ELDER RELATIVES IF
NOT THEMSELVES MIGHT SURELY COME INTO COURT AND WITNESS AGAINST HIM
AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY STILL FOR THEM TO APPEAR
BUT THEIR FATHERS
AND BROTHERS ALL APPEAR IN COURT INCLUDING 'THIS' PLATO TO WITNESS
ON HIS BEHALF AND IF THEIR RELATIVES ARE CORRUPTED AT LEAST THEY
ARE UNCORRUPTED 'AND THEY ARE MY WITNESSES
FOR THEY KNOW THAT I AM
SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND THAT MELETUS IS LYING
THIS IS ABOUT ALL THAT HE HAS TO SAY
HE WILL NOT ENTREAT THE JUDGES TO
SPARE HIS LIFE NEITHER WILL HE PRESENT A SPECTACLE OF WEEPING CHILDREN
ALTHOUGH HE TOO IS NOT MADE OF 'ROCK OR OAK SOME OF THE JUDGES
THEMSELVES MAY HAVE COMPLIED WITH THIS PRACTICE ON SIMILAR OCCASIONS
AND HE TRUSTS THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH HIM FOR NOT FOLLOWING
THEIR EXAMPLE
BUT HE FEELS THAT SUCH CONDUCT BRINGS DISCREDIT ON THE
NAME OF ATHENS HE FEELS TOO THAT THE JUDGE HAS SWORN NOT TO GIVE AWAY
JUSTICE AND HE CANNOT BE GUILTY OF THE IMPIETY OF ASKING THE JUDGE TO
BREAK HIS OATH WHEN HE IS HIMSELF BEING TRIED FOR IMPIETY
AS HE EXPECTED AND PROBABLY INTENDED HE IS CONVICTED
AND NOW THE TONE
OF THE SPEECH INSTEAD OF BEING MORE CONCILIATORY BECOMES MORE
LOFTY AND COMMANDING
ANYTUS PROPOSES DEATH AS THE PENALTY AND WHAT
COUNTER PROPOSITION SHALL HE MAKE HE THE BENEFACTOR OF THE ATHENIAN
PEOPLE WHOSE WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN SPENT IN DOING THEM GOOD SHOULD AT
LEAST HAVE THE OLYMPIC VICTOR'S REWARD OF MAINTENANCE IN THE PRYTANEUM
OR WHY SHOULD HE PROPOSE ANY COUNTER PENALTY WHEN HE DOES NOT KNOW
WHETHER DEATH WHICH ANYTUS PROPOSES IS A GOOD OR AN EVIL AND HE IS
CERTAIN THAT IMPRISONMENT IS AN EVIL EXILE IS AN EVIL
LOSS OF MONEY
MIGHT BE AN EVIL BUT THEN HE HAS NONE TO GIVE PERHAPS HE CAN MAKE UP
A MINA
LET THAT BE THE PENALTY OR IF HIS FRIENDS WISH THIRTY MINAE
FOR WHICH THEY WILL BE EXCELLENT SECURITIES
HE IS CONDEMNED TO DEATH
HE IS AN OLD MAN ALREADY AND THE ATHENIANS WILL GAIN NOTHING BUT
DISGRACE BY DEPRIVING HIM OF A FEW YEARS OF LIFE
PERHAPS HE COULD HAVE
ESCAPED IF HE HAD CHOSEN TO THROW DOWN HIS ARMS AND ENTREAT FOR HIS
LIFE
BUT HE DOES NOT AT ALL REPENT OF THE MANNER OF HIS DEFENCE HE
WOULD RATHER DIE IN HIS OWN FASHION THAN LIVE IN THEIRS
FOR THE PENALTY
OF UNRIGHTEOUSNESS IS SWIFTER THAN DEATH THAT PENALTY HAS ALREADY
OVERTAKEN HIS ACCUSERS AS DEATH WILL SOON OVERTAKE HIM
AND NOW AS ONE WHO IS ABOUT TO DIE HE WILL PROPHESY TO THEM
THEY HAVE
PUT HIM TO DEATH IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THE NECESSITY OF GIVING AN ACCOUNT
OF THEIR LIVES
BUT HIS DEATH 'WILL BE THE SEED' OF MANY DISCIPLES WHO
WILL CONVINCE THEM OF THEIR EVIL WAYS AND WILL COME FORTH TO REPROVE
THEM IN HARSHER TERMS BECAUSE THEY ARE YOUNGER AND MORE INCONSIDERATE
HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS WHILE THERE IS TIME TO THOSE WHO
WOULD HAVE ACQUITTED HIM
HE WISHES THEM TO KNOW THAT THE DIVINE SIGN
NEVER INTERRUPTED HIM IN THE COURSE OF HIS DEFENCE THE REASON OF WHICH
AS HE CONJECTURES IS THAT THE DEATH TO WHICH HE IS GOING IS A GOOD AND
NOT AN EVIL
FOR EITHER DEATH IS A LONG SLEEP THE BEST OF SLEEPS OR
A JOURNEY TO ANOTHER WORLD IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD ARE GATHERED
TOGETHER AND IN WHICH THERE MAY BE A HOPE OF SEEING THE HEROES OF
OLD IN WHICH TOO THERE ARE JUST JUDGES AND AS ALL ARE IMMORTAL
THERE CAN BE NO FEAR OF ANY ONE SUFFERING DEATH FOR HIS OPINIONS
NOTHING EVIL CAN HAPPEN TO THE GOOD MAN EITHER IN LIFE OR DEATH AND HIS
OWN DEATH HAS BEEN PERMITTED BY THE GODS BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM
TO DEPART AND THEREFORE HE FORGIVES HIS JUDGES BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE
HIM NO HARM ALTHOUGH THEY NEVER MEANT TO DO HIM ANY GOOD
HE HAS A LAST REQUEST TO MAKE TO THEM THAT THEY WILL TROUBLE HIS SONS
AS HE HAS TROUBLED THEM IF THEY APPEAR TO PREFER RICHES TO VIRTUE OR
TO THINK THEMSELVES SOMETHING WHEN THEY ARE NOTHING
'FEW PERSONS WILL BE FOUND TO WISH THAT SOCRATES SHOULD HAVE DEFENDED
HIMSELF OTHERWISE IF AS WE MUST ADD HIS DEFENCE WAS THAT WITH WHICH
PLATO HAS PROVIDED HIM
BUT LEAVING THIS QUESTION WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT
OF A PRECISE SOLUTION WE MAY GO ON TO ASK WHAT WAS THE IMPRESSION WHICH
PLATO IN THE APOLOGY INTENDED TO GIVE OF THE CHARACTER AND CONDUCT OF
HIS MASTER IN THE LAST GREAT SCENE DID HE INTEND TO REPRESENT HIM 1
AS EMPLOYING SOPHISTRIES 2 AS DESIGNEDLY IRRITATING THE JUDGES OR
ARE THESE SOPHISTRIES TO BE REGARDED AS BELONGING TO THE AGE IN WHICH
HE LIVED AND TO HIS PERSONAL CHARACTER AND THIS APPARENT HAUGHTINESS AS
FLOWING FROM THE NATURAL ELEVATION OF HIS POSITION
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN HE SAYS THAT IT IS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THAT ONE MAN IS
THE CORRUPTER AND ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD THE IMPROVERS OF THE YOUTH
OR WHEN HE ARGUES THAT HE NEVER COULD HAVE CORRUPTED THE MEN WITH WHOM
HE HAD TO LIVE OR WHEN HE PROVES HIS BELIEF IN THE GODS BECAUSE
HE BELIEVES IN THE SONS OF GODS IS HE SERIOUS OR JESTING IT MAY BE
OBSERVED THAT THESE SOPHISMS ALL OCCUR IN HIS CROSS EXAMINATION OF
MELETUS WHO IS EASILY FOILED AND MASTERED IN THE HANDS OF THE GREAT
DIALECTICIAN
PERHAPS HE REGARDED THESE ANSWERS AS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIS
ACCUSER OF WHOM HE MAKES VERY LIGHT
ALSO THERE IS A TOUCH OF IRONY
IN THEM WHICH TAKES THEM OUT OF THE CATEGORY OF SOPHISTRY
COMPARE
EUTHYPH
THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH HE DEFENDS HIMSELF ABOUT THE LIVES OF HIS
DISCIPLES IS NOT SATISFACTORY CAN HARDLY BE DENIED
FRESH IN THE MEMORY
OF THE ATHENIANS AND DETESTABLE AS THEY DESERVED TO BE TO THE NEWLY
RESTORED DEMOCRACY WERE THE NAMES OF ALCIBIADES CRITIAS CHARMIDES
IT
IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A SUFFICIENT ANSWER THAT SOCRATES HAD NEVER PROFESSED
TO TEACH THEM ANYTHING AND IS THEREFORE NOT JUSTLY CHARGEABLE WITH
THEIR CRIMES
YET THE DEFENCE WHEN TAKEN OUT OF THIS IRONICAL FORM
IS DOUBTLESS SOUND THAT HIS TEACHING HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR EVIL
LIVES
HERE THEN THE SOPHISTRY IS RATHER IN FORM THAN IN SUBSTANCE
THOUGH WE MIGHT DESIRE THAT TO SUCH A SERIOUS CHARGE SOCRATES HAD GIVEN
A MORE SERIOUS ANSWER
TRULY CHARACTERISTIC OF SOCRATES IS ANOTHER POINT IN HIS ANSWER WHICH
MAY ALSO BE REGARDED AS SOPHISTICAL
HE SAYS THAT 'IF HE HAS CORRUPTED
THE YOUTH HE MUST HAVE CORRUPTED THEM INVOLUNTARILY BUT IF AS
SOCRATES ARGUES ALL EVIL IS INVOLUNTARY THEN ALL CRIMINALS OUGHT TO BE
ADMONISHED AND NOT PUNISHED
IN THESE WORDS THE SOCRATIC DOCTRINE OF THE
INVOLUNTARINESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY INTENDED TO BE CONVEYED
HERE
AGAIN AS IN THE FORMER INSTANCE THE DEFENCE OF SOCRATES IS UNTRUE
PRACTICALLY BUT MAY BE TRUE IN SOME IDEAL OR TRANSCENDENTAL SENSE
THE
COMMONPLACE REPLY THAT IF HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF CORRUPTING THE YOUTH
THEIR RELATIONS WOULD SURELY HAVE WITNESSED AGAINST HIM WITH WHICH HE
CONCLUDES THIS PART OF HIS DEFENCE IS MORE SATISFACTORY
AGAIN WHEN SOCRATES ARGUES THAT HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GODS BECAUSE HE
BELIEVES IN THE SONS OF GODS WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THIS IS A REFUTATION
NOT OF THE ORIGINAL INDICTMENT WHICH IS CONSISTENT ENOUGH 'SOCRATES
DOES NOT RECEIVE THE GODS WHOM THE CITY RECEIVES AND HAS OTHER NEW
DIVINITIES' BUT OF THE INTERPRETATION PUT UPON THE WORDS BY MELETUS
WHO HAS AFFIRMED THAT HE IS A DOWNRIGHT ATHEIST
TO THIS SOCRATES FAIRLY
ANSWERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IDEAS OF THE TIME THAT A DOWNRIGHT
ATHEIST CANNOT BELIEVE IN THE SONS OF GODS OR IN DIVINE THINGS
THE
NOTION THAT DEMONS OR LESSER DIVINITIES ARE THE SONS OF GODS IS NOT
TO BE REGARDED AS IRONICAL OR SCEPTICAL
HE IS ARGUING 'AD HOMINEM'
ACCORDING TO THE NOTIONS OF MYTHOLOGY CURRENT IN HIS AGE
YET HE
ABSTAINS FROM SAYING THAT HE BELIEVED IN THE GODS WHOM THE STATE
APPROVED
HE DOES NOT DEFEND HIMSELF AS XENOPHON HAS DEFENDED HIM
BY APPEALING TO HIS PRACTICE OF RELIGION
PROBABLY HE NEITHER WHOLLY
BELIEVED NOR DISBELIEVED IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE POPULAR GODS HE
HAD NO MEANS OF KNOWING ABOUT THEM
ACCORDING TO PLATO COMPARE PHAEDO
SYMP AS WELL AS XENOPHON MEMOR HE WAS PUNCTUAL IN THE PERFORMANCE
OF THE LEAST RELIGIOUS DUTIES AND HE MUST HAVE BELIEVED IN HIS OWN
ORACULAR SIGN OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO HAVE AN INTERNAL WITNESS
BUT THE
EXISTENCE OF APOLLO OR ZEUS OR THE OTHER GODS WHOM THE STATE APPROVES
WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HIM BOTH UNCERTAIN AND UNIMPORTANT IN COMPARISON
OF THE DUTY OF SELF EXAMINATION AND OF THOSE PRINCIPLES OF TRUTH
AND RIGHT WHICH HE DEEMED TO BE THE FOUNDATION OF RELIGION
COMPARE
PHAEDR EUTHYPH REPUBLIC
THE SECOND QUESTION WHETHER PLATO MEANT TO REPRESENT SOCRATES AS
BRAVING OR IRRITATING HIS JUDGES MUST ALSO BE ANSWERED IN THE NEGATIVE
HIS IRONY HIS SUPERIORITY HIS AUDACITY 'REGARDING NOT THE PERSON OF
MAN NECESSARILY FLOW OUT OF THE LOFTINESS OF HIS SITUATION
HE IS NOT
ACTING A PART UPON A GREAT OCCASION BUT HE IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN ALL HIS
LIFE LONG 'A KING OF MEN HE WOULD RATHER NOT APPEAR INSOLENT IF
HE COULD AVOID IT OUCH OS AUTHADIZOMENOS TOUTO LEGO
NEITHER IS
HE DESIROUS OF HASTENING HIS OWN END FOR LIFE AND DEATH ARE SIMPLY
INDIFFERENT TO HIM
BUT SUCH A DEFENCE AS WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO HIS
JUDGES AND MIGHT PROCURE AN ACQUITTAL IT IS NOT IN HIS NATURE TO MAKE
HE WILL NOT SAY OR DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT PERVERT THE COURSE OF JUSTICE
HE CANNOT HAVE HIS TONGUE BOUND EVEN 'IN THE THROAT OF DEATH WITH
HIS ACCUSERS HE WILL ONLY FENCE AND PLAY AS HE HAD FENCED WITH OTHER
'IMPROVERS OF YOUTH ANSWERING THE SOPHIST ACCORDING TO HIS SOPHISTRY
ALL HIS LIFE LONG
HE IS SERIOUS WHEN HE IS SPEAKING OF HIS OWN MISSION
WHICH SEEMS TO DISTINGUISH HIM FROM ALL OTHER REFORMERS OF MANKIND AND
ORIGINATES IN AN ACCIDENT
THE DEDICATION OF HIMSELF TO THE IMPROVEMENT
OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS IS NOT SO REMARKABLE AS THE IRONICAL SPIRIT IN
WHICH HE GOES ABOUT DOING GOOD ONLY IN VINDICATION OF THE CREDIT OF THE
ORACLE AND IN THE VAIN HOPE OF FINDING A WISER MAN THAN HIMSELF
YET
THIS SINGULAR AND ALMOST ACCIDENTAL CHARACTER OF HIS MISSION AGREES WITH
THE DIVINE SIGN WHICH ACCORDING TO OUR NOTIONS IS EQUALLY ACCIDENTAL
AND IRRATIONAL AND IS NEVERTHELESS ACCEPTED BY HIM AS THE GUIDING
PRINCIPLE OF HIS LIFE
SOCRATES IS NOWHERE REPRESENTED TO US AS A
FREETHINKER OR SCEPTIC
THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT HIS SINCERITY WHEN
HE SPECULATES ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEING AND KNOWING THE HEROES OF THE
TROJAN WAR IN ANOTHER WORLD
ON THE OTHER HAND HIS HOPE OF IMMORTALITY
IS UNCERTAIN HE ALSO CONCEIVES OF DEATH AS A LONG SLEEP IN
THIS RESPECT DIFFERING FROM THE PHAEDO AND AT LAST FALLS BACK ON
RESIGNATION TO THE DIVINE WILL AND THE CERTAINTY THAT NO EVIL
CAN HAPPEN TO THE GOOD MAN EITHER IN LIFE OR DEATH
HIS ABSOLUTE
TRUTHFULNESS SEEMS TO HINDER HIM FROM ASSERTING POSITIVELY MORE THAN
THIS AND HE MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO VEIL HIS IGNORANCE IN MYTHOLOGY AND
FIGURES OF SPEECH
THE GENTLENESS OF THE FIRST PART OF THE SPEECH
CONTRASTS WITH THE AGGRAVATED ALMOST THREATENING TONE OF THE
CONCLUSION
HE CHARACTERISTICALLY REMARKS THAT HE WILL NOT SPEAK AS A
RHETORICIAN THAT IS TO SAY HE WILL NOT MAKE A REGULAR DEFENCE SUCH AS
LYSIAS OR ONE OF THE ORATORS MIGHT HAVE COMPOSED FOR HIM OR ACCORDING
TO SOME ACCOUNTS DID COMPOSE FOR HIM
BUT HE FIRST PROCURES HIMSELF A
HEARING BY CONCILIATORY WORDS
HE DOES NOT ATTACK THE SOPHISTS FOR THEY
WERE OPEN TO THE SAME CHARGES AS HIMSELF THEY WERE EQUALLY RIDICULED BY
THE COMIC POETS AND ALMOST EQUALLY HATEFUL TO ANYTUS AND MELETUS
YET
INCIDENTALLY THE ANTAGONISM BETWEEN SOCRATES AND THE SOPHISTS IS ALLOWED
TO APPEAR
HE IS POOR AND THEY ARE RICH HIS PROFESSION THAT HE TEACHES
NOTHING IS OPPOSED TO THEIR READINESS TO TEACH ALL THINGS HIS TALKING
IN THE MARKETPLACE TO THEIR PRIVATE INSTRUCTIONS HIS TARRY AT HOME LIFE
TO THEIR WANDERING FROM CITY TO CITY
THE TONE WHICH HE ASSUMES TOWARDS
THEM IS ONE OF REAL FRIENDLINESS BUT ALSO OF CONCEALED IRONY
TOWARDS
ANAXAGORAS WHO HAD DISAPPOINTED HIM IN HIS HOPES OF LEARNING ABOUT MIND
AND NATURE HE SHOWS A LESS KINDLY FEELING WHICH IS ALSO THE FEELING
OF PLATO IN OTHER PASSAGES LAWS
BUT ANAXAGORAS HAD BEEN DEAD THIRTY
YEARS AND WAS BEYOND THE REACH OF PERSECUTION
IT HAS BEEN REMARKED THAT THE PROPHECY OF A NEW GENERATION OF TEACHERS
WHO WOULD REBUKE AND EXHORT THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE IN HARSHER AND MORE
VIOLENT TERMS WAS AS FAR AS WE KNOW NEVER FULFILLED
NO INFERENCE
CAN BE DRAWN FROM THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AS TO THE PROBABILITY OF THE
WORDS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM HAVING BEEN ACTUALLY UTTERED
THEY EXPRESS THE
ASPIRATION OF THE FIRST MARTYR OF PHILOSOPHY THAT HE WOULD LEAVE BEHIND
HIM MANY FOLLOWERS ACCOMPANIED BY THE NOT UNNATURAL FEELING THAT THEY
WOULD BE FIERCER AND MORE INCONSIDERATE IN THEIR WORDS WHEN EMANCIPATED
FROM HIS CONTROL
THE ABOVE REMARKS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD AS APPLYING WITH ANY DEGREE OF
CERTAINTY TO THE PLATONIC SOCRATES ONLY
FOR ALTHOUGH THESE OR SIMILAR
WORDS MAY HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY SOCRATES HIMSELF WE CANNOT EXCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT LIKE SO MUCH ELSE E G
THE WISDOM OF CRITIAS THE
POEM OF SOLON THE VIRTUES OF CHARMIDES THEY MAY HAVE BEEN DUE ONLY TO
THE IMAGINATION OF PLATO
THE ARGUMENTS OF THOSE WHO MAINTAIN THAT THE
APOLOGY WAS COMPOSED DURING THE PROCESS RESTING ON NO EVIDENCE DO NOT
REQUIRE A SERIOUS REFUTATION
NOR ARE THE REASONINGS OF SCHLEIERMACHER
WHO ARGUES THAT THE PLATONIC DEFENCE IS AN EXACT OR NEARLY EXACT
REPRODUCTION OF THE WORDS OF SOCRATES PARTLY BECAUSE PLATO WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF THE IMPIETY OF ALTERING THEM AND ALSO BECAUSE MANY
POINTS OF THE DEFENCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPROVED AND STRENGTHENED AT ALL
MORE CONCLUSIVE
SEE ENGLISH TRANSLATION WHAT EFFECT THE DEATH OF
SOCRATES PRODUCED ON THE MIND OF PLATO WE CANNOT CERTAINLY
DETERMINE NOR CAN WE SAY HOW HE WOULD OR MUST HAVE WRITTEN UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
WE OBSERVE THAT THE ENMITY OF ARISTOPHANES TO SOCRATES
DOES NOT PREVENT PLATO FROM INTRODUCING THEM TOGETHER IN THE SYMPOSIUM
ENGAGED IN FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE
NOR IS THERE ANY TRACE IN THE DIALOGUES
OF AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE ANYTUS OR MELETUS PERSONALLY ODIOUS IN THE EYES OF
THE ATHENIAN PUBLIC
APOLOGY
HOW YOU O ATHENIANS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY MY ACCUSERS I CANNOT TELL
BUT I KNOW THAT THEY ALMOST MADE ME FORGET WHO I WAS SO PERSUASIVELY
DID THEY SPEAK AND YET THEY HAVE HARDLY UTTERED A WORD OF TRUTH
BUT
OF THE MANY FALSEHOODS TOLD BY THEM THERE WAS ONE WHICH QUITE AMAZED
ME I MEAN WHEN THEY SAID THAT YOU SHOULD BE UPON YOUR GUARD AND NOT
ALLOW YOURSELVES TO BE DECEIVED BY THE FORCE OF MY ELOQUENCE
TO SAY
THIS WHEN THEY WERE CERTAIN TO BE DETECTED AS SOON AS I OPENED MY LIPS
AND PROVED MYSELF TO BE ANYTHING BUT A GREAT SPEAKER DID INDEED APPEAR
TO ME MOST SHAMELESS UNLESS BY THE FORCE OF ELOQUENCE THEY MEAN
THE FORCE OF TRUTH FOR IS SUCH IS THEIR MEANING I ADMIT THAT I AM
ELOQUENT
BUT IN HOW DIFFERENT A WAY FROM THEIRS WELL AS I WAS SAYING
THEY HAVE SCARCELY SPOKEN THE TRUTH AT ALL BUT FROM ME YOU SHALL HEAR
THE WHOLE TRUTH NOT HOWEVER DELIVERED AFTER THEIR MANNER IN A SET
ORATION DULY ORNAMENTED WITH WORDS AND PHRASES
NO BY HEAVEN BUT I
SHALL USE THE WORDS AND ARGUMENTS WHICH OCCUR TO ME AT THE MOMENT FOR
I AM CONFIDENT IN THE JUSTICE OF MY CAUSE OR I AM CERTAIN THAT I AM
RIGHT IN TAKING THIS COURSE AT MY TIME OF LIFE I OUGHT NOT TO BE
APPEARING BEFORE YOU O MEN OF ATHENS IN THE CHARACTER OF A JUVENILE
ORATOR LET NO ONE EXPECT IT OF ME
AND I MUST BEG OF YOU TO GRANT ME
A FAVOUR IF I DEFEND MYSELF IN MY ACCUSTOMED MANNER AND YOU HEAR ME
USING THE WORDS WHICH I HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF USING IN THE AGORA AT
THE TABLES OF THE MONEY CHANGERS OR ANYWHERE ELSE I WOULD ASK YOU NOT
TO BE SURPRISED AND NOT TO INTERRUPT ME ON THIS ACCOUNT
FOR I AM MORE
THAN SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE AND APPEARING NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A
COURT OF LAW I AM QUITE A STRANGER TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE PLACE AND
THEREFORE I WOULD HAVE YOU REGARD ME AS IF I WERE REALLY A STRANGER
WHOM YOU WOULD EXCUSE IF HE SPOKE IN HIS NATIVE TONGUE AND AFTER THE
FASHION OF HIS COUNTRY AM I MAKING AN UNFAIR REQUEST OF YOU NEVER
MIND THE MANNER WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE GOOD BUT THINK ONLY OF THE
TRUTH OF MY WORDS AND GIVE HEED TO THAT LET THE SPEAKER SPEAK TRULY
AND THE JUDGE DECIDE JUSTLY
AND FIRST I HAVE TO REPLY TO THE OLDER CHARGES AND TO MY FIRST
ACCUSERS AND THEN I WILL GO ON TO THE LATER ONES
FOR OF OLD I HAVE HAD
MANY ACCUSERS WHO HAVE ACCUSED ME FALSELY TO YOU DURING MANY YEARS
AND I AM MORE AFRAID OF THEM THAN OF ANYTUS AND HIS ASSOCIATES WHO ARE
DANGEROUS TOO IN THEIR OWN WAY
BUT FAR MORE DANGEROUS ARE THE OTHERS
WHO BEGAN WHEN YOU WERE CHILDREN AND TOOK POSSESSION OF YOUR MINDS WITH
THEIR FALSEHOODS TELLING OF ONE SOCRATES A WISE MAN WHO SPECULATED
ABOUT THE HEAVEN ABOVE AND SEARCHED INTO THE EARTH BENEATH AND MADE
THE WORSE APPEAR THE BETTER CAUSE
THE DISSEMINATORS OF THIS TALE ARE
THE ACCUSERS WHOM I DREAD FOR THEIR HEARERS ARE APT TO FANCY THAT SUCH
ENQUIRERS DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF THE GODS
AND THEY ARE
MANY AND THEIR CHARGES AGAINST ME ARE OF ANCIENT DATE AND THEY WERE
MADE BY THEM IN THE DAYS WHEN YOU WERE MORE IMPRESSIBLE THAN YOU ARE
NOW IN CHILDHOOD OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN IN YOUTH AND THE CAUSE WHEN
HEARD WENT BY DEFAULT FOR THERE WAS NONE TO ANSWER
AND HARDEST OF ALL
I DO NOT KNOW AND CANNOT TELL THE NAMES OF MY ACCUSERS UNLESS IN THE
CHANCE CASE OF A COMIC POET
ALL WHO FROM ENVY AND MALICE HAVE PERSUADED
YOU SOME OF THEM HAVING FIRST CONVINCED THEMSELVES ALL THIS CLASS OF
MEN ARE MOST DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH FOR I CANNOT HAVE THEM UP HERE AND
CROSS EXAMINE THEM AND THEREFORE I MUST SIMPLY FIGHT WITH SHADOWS IN MY
OWN DEFENCE AND ARGUE WHEN THERE IS NO ONE WHO ANSWERS
I WILL ASK YOU
THEN TO ASSUME WITH ME AS I WAS SAYING THAT MY OPPONENTS ARE OF TWO
KINDS ONE RECENT THE OTHER ANCIENT AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL SEE THE
PROPRIETY OF MY ANSWERING THE LATTER FIRST FOR THESE ACCUSATIONS YOU
HEARD LONG BEFORE THE OTHERS AND MUCH OFTENER
WELL THEN I MUST MAKE MY DEFENCE AND ENDEAVOUR TO CLEAR AWAY IN A
SHORT TIME A SLANDER WHICH HAS LASTED A LONG TIME
MAY I SUCCEED IF TO
SUCCEED BE FOR MY GOOD AND YOURS OR LIKELY TO AVAIL ME IN MY CAUSE
THE TASK IS NOT AN EASY ONE I QUITE UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF IT
AND SO
LEAVING THE EVENT WITH GOD IN OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW I WILL NOW MAKE MY
DEFENCE
I WILL BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND ASK WHAT IS THE ACCUSATION WHICH HAS
GIVEN RISE TO THE SLANDER OF ME AND IN FACT HAS ENCOURAGED MELETUS TO
PROOF THIS CHARGE AGAINST ME
WELL WHAT DO THE SLANDERERS SAY THEY
SHALL BE MY PROSECUTORS AND I WILL SUM UP THEIR WORDS IN AN AFFIDAVIT
'SOCRATES IS AN EVIL DOER AND A CURIOUS PERSON WHO SEARCHES INTO
THINGS UNDER THE EARTH AND IN HEAVEN AND HE MAKES THE WORSE APPEAR THE
BETTER CAUSE AND HE TEACHES THE AFORESAID DOCTRINES TO OTHERS SUCH IS
THE NATURE OF THE ACCUSATION IT IS JUST WHAT YOU HAVE YOURSELVES SEEN
IN THE COMEDY OF ARISTOPHANES ARISTOPH CLOUDS WHO HAS INTRODUCED A
MAN WHOM HE CALLS SOCRATES GOING ABOUT AND SAYING THAT HE WALKS IN
AIR AND TALKING A DEAL OF NONSENSE CONCERNING MATTERS OF WHICH I DO
NOT PRETEND TO KNOW EITHER MUCH OR LITTLE NOT THAT I MEAN TO SPEAK
DISPARAGINGLY OF ANY ONE WHO IS A STUDENT OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY
I
SHOULD BE VERY SORRY IF MELETUS COULD BRING SO GRAVE A CHARGE AGAINST
ME
BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS O ATHENIANS THAT I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
PHYSICAL SPECULATIONS
VERY MANY OF THOSE HERE PRESENT ARE WITNESSES TO
THE TRUTH OF THIS AND TO THEM I APPEAL
SPEAK THEN YOU WHO HAVE HEARD
ME AND TELL YOUR NEIGHBOURS WHETHER ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN ME HOLD
FORTH IN FEW WORDS OR IN MANY UPON SUCH MATTERS YOU HEAR THEIR ANSWER
AND FROM WHAT THEY SAY OF THIS PART OF THE CHARGE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO
JUDGE OF THE TRUTH OF THE REST
AS LITTLE FOUNDATION IS THERE FOR THE REPORT THAT I AM A TEACHER AND
TAKE MONEY THIS ACCUSATION HAS NO MORE TRUTH IN IT THAN THE OTHER
ALTHOUGH IF A MAN WERE REALLY ABLE TO INSTRUCT MANKIND TO RECEIVE
MONEY FOR GIVING INSTRUCTION WOULD IN MY OPINION BE AN HONOUR TO HIM
THERE IS GORGIAS OF LEONTIUM AND PRODICUS OF CEOS AND HIPPIAS OF ELIS
WHO GO THE ROUND OF THE CITIES AND ARE ABLE TO PERSUADE THE YOUNG MEN
TO LEAVE THEIR OWN CITIZENS BY WHOM THEY MIGHT BE TAUGHT FOR NOTHING
AND COME TO THEM WHOM THEY NOT ONLY PAY BUT ARE THANKFUL IF THEY MAY BE
ALLOWED TO PAY THEM
THERE IS AT THIS TIME A PARIAN PHILOSOPHER RESIDING
IN ATHENS OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD AND I CAME TO HEAR OF HIM IN THIS
WAY I CAME ACROSS A MAN WHO HAS SPENT A WORLD OF MONEY ON THE
SOPHISTS CALLIAS THE SON OF HIPPONICUS AND KNOWING THAT HE HAD SONS
I ASKED HIM 'CALLIAS I SAID 'IF YOUR TWO SONS WERE FOALS OR CALVES
THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING SOME ONE TO PUT OVER THEM WE
SHOULD HIRE A TRAINER OF HORSES OR A FARMER PROBABLY WHO WOULD IMPROVE
AND PERFECT THEM IN THEIR OWN PROPER VIRTUE AND EXCELLENCE BUT AS THEY
ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHOM ARE YOU THINKING OF PLACING OVER THEM IS THERE
ANY ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS HUMAN AND POLITICAL VIRTUE YOU MUST HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT THE MATTER FOR YOU HAVE SONS IS THERE ANY ONE 'THERE
IS HE SAID
'WHO IS HE SAID I 'AND OF WHAT COUNTRY AND WHAT DOES
HE CHARGE 'EVENUS THE PARIAN HE REPLIED 'HE IS THE MAN AND HIS
CHARGE IS FIVE MINAE HAPPY IS EVENUS I SAID TO MYSELF IF HE REALLY
HAS THIS WISDOM AND TEACHES AT SUCH A MODERATE CHARGE
HAD I THE SAME
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN VERY PROUD AND CONCEITED BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT I
HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE KIND
I DARE SAY ATHENIANS THAT SOME ONE AMONG YOU WILL REPLY 'YES
SOCRATES BUT WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THESE ACCUSATIONS WHICH ARE BROUGHT
AGAINST YOU THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING STRANGE WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN
DOING ALL THESE RUMOURS AND THIS TALK ABOUT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE ARISEN
IF YOU HAD BEEN LIKE OTHER MEN TELL US THEN WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF
THEM FOR WE SHOULD BE SORRY TO JUDGE HASTILY OF YOU NOW I REGARD THIS
AS A FAIR CHALLENGE AND I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE REASON
WHY I AM CALLED WISE AND HAVE SUCH AN EVIL FAME
PLEASE TO ATTEND THEN
AND ALTHOUGH SOME OF YOU MAY THINK THAT I AM JOKING I DECLARE THAT I
WILL TELL YOU THE ENTIRE TRUTH
MEN OF ATHENS THIS REPUTATION OF MINE
HAS COME OF A CERTAIN SORT OF WISDOM WHICH I POSSESS
IF YOU ASK ME WHAT
KIND OF WISDOM I REPLY WISDOM SUCH AS MAY PERHAPS BE ATTAINED BY MAN
FOR TO THAT EXTENT I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT I AM WISE WHEREAS THE
PERSONS OF WHOM I WAS SPEAKING HAVE A SUPERHUMAN WISDOM WHICH I MAY FAIL
TO DESCRIBE BECAUSE I HAVE IT NOT MYSELF AND HE WHO SAYS THAT I HAVE
SPEAKS FALSELY AND IS TAKING AWAY MY CHARACTER
AND HERE O MEN OF
ATHENS I MUST BEG YOU NOT TO INTERRUPT ME EVEN IF I SEEM TO SAY
SOMETHING EXTRAVAGANT
FOR THE WORD WHICH I WILL SPEAK IS NOT MINE
I
WILL REFER YOU TO A WITNESS WHO IS WORTHY OF CREDIT THAT WITNESS SHALL
BE THE GOD OF DELPHI HE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY WISDOM IF I HAVE ANY
AND OF WHAT SORT IT IS
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN CHAEREPHON HE WAS EARLY A
FRIEND OF MINE AND ALSO A FRIEND OF YOURS FOR HE SHARED IN THE RECENT
EXILE OF THE PEOPLE AND RETURNED WITH YOU
WELL CHAEREPHON AS YOU
KNOW WAS VERY IMPETUOUS IN ALL HIS DOINGS AND HE WENT TO DELPHI AND
BOLDLY ASKED THE ORACLE TO TELL HIM WHETHER AS I WAS SAYING I MUST BEG
YOU NOT TO INTERRUPT HE ASKED THE ORACLE TO TELL HIM WHETHER ANYONE WAS
WISER THAN I WAS AND THE PYTHIAN PROPHETESS ANSWERED THAT THERE WAS NO
MAN WISER
CHAEREPHON IS DEAD HIMSELF BUT HIS BROTHER WHO IS IN COURT
WILL CONFIRM THE TRUTH OF WHAT I AM SAYING
WHY DO I MENTION THIS BECAUSE I AM GOING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY I HAVE
SUCH AN EVIL NAME
WHEN I HEARD THE ANSWER I SAID TO MYSELF WHAT CAN
THE GOD MEAN AND WHAT IS THE INTERPRETATION OF HIS RIDDLE FOR I KNOW
THAT I HAVE NO WISDOM SMALL OR GREAT
WHAT THEN CAN HE MEAN WHEN HE
SAYS THAT I AM THE WISEST OF MEN AND YET HE IS A GOD AND CANNOT LIE
THAT WOULD BE AGAINST HIS NATURE
AFTER LONG CONSIDERATION I THOUGHT OF
A METHOD OF TRYING THE QUESTION
I REFLECTED THAT IF I COULD ONLY FIND
A MAN WISER THAN MYSELF THEN I MIGHT GO TO THE GOD WITH A REFUTATION IN
MY HAND
I SHOULD SAY TO HIM 'HERE IS A MAN WHO IS WISER THAN I AM BUT
YOU SAID THAT I WAS THE WISEST ACCORDINGLY I WENT TO ONE WHO HAD THE
REPUTATION OF WISDOM AND OBSERVED HIM HIS NAME I NEED NOT MENTION HE
WAS A POLITICIAN WHOM I SELECTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THE RESULT WAS AS
FOLLOWS WHEN I BEGAN TO TALK WITH HIM I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT
HE WAS NOT REALLY WISE ALTHOUGH HE WAS THOUGHT WISE BY MANY AND
STILL WISER BY HIMSELF AND THEREUPON I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT HE
THOUGHT HIMSELF WISE BUT WAS NOT REALLY WISE AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS
THAT HE HATED ME AND HIS ENMITY WAS SHARED BY SEVERAL WHO WERE PRESENT
AND HEARD ME
SO I LEFT HIM SAYING TO MYSELF AS I WENT AWAY WELL
ALTHOUGH I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT EITHER OF US KNOWS ANYTHING REALLY
BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD I AM BETTER OFF THAN HE IS FOR HE KNOWS NOTHING
AND THINKS THAT HE KNOWS I NEITHER KNOW NOR THINK THAT I KNOW
IN THIS
LATTER PARTICULAR THEN I SEEM TO HAVE SLIGHTLY THE ADVANTAGE OF HIM
THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER WHO HAD STILL HIGHER PRETENSIONS TO WISDOM AND
MY CONCLUSION WAS EXACTLY THE SAME
WHEREUPON I MADE ANOTHER ENEMY OF
HIM AND OF MANY OTHERS BESIDES HIM
THEN I WENT TO ONE MAN AFTER ANOTHER BEING NOT UNCONSCIOUS OF THE
ENMITY WHICH I PROVOKED AND I LAMENTED AND FEARED THIS BUT NECESSITY
WAS LAID UPON ME THE WORD OF GOD I THOUGHT OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED
FIRST
AND I SAID TO MYSELF GO I MUST TO ALL WHO APPEAR TO KNOW AND
FIND OUT THE MEANING OF THE ORACLE
AND I SWEAR TO YOU ATHENIANS
BY THE DOG I SWEAR FOR I MUST TELL YOU THE TRUTH THE RESULT OF MY
MISSION WAS JUST THIS I FOUND THAT THE MEN MOST IN REPUTE WERE ALL BUT
THE MOST FOOLISH AND THAT OTHERS LESS ESTEEMED WERE REALLY WISER AND
BETTER
I WILL TELL YOU THE TALE OF MY WANDERINGS AND OF THE 'HERCULEAN'
LABOURS AS I MAY CALL THEM WHICH I ENDURED ONLY TO FIND AT LAST THE
ORACLE IRREFUTABLE
AFTER THE POLITICIANS I WENT TO THE POETS TRAGIC
DITHYRAMBIC AND ALL SORTS
AND THERE I SAID TO MYSELF YOU WILL BE
INSTANTLY DETECTED NOW YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE MORE IGNORANT
THAN THEY ARE
ACCORDINGLY I TOOK THEM SOME OF THE MOST ELABORATE
PASSAGES IN THEIR OWN WRITINGS AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MEANING OF
THEM THINKING THAT THEY WOULD TEACH ME SOMETHING
WILL YOU BELIEVE ME
I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO CONFESS THE TRUTH BUT I MUST SAY THAT THERE IS
HARDLY A PERSON PRESENT WHO WOULD NOT HAVE TALKED BETTER ABOUT THEIR
POETRY THAN THEY DID THEMSELVES
THEN I KNEW THAT NOT BY WISDOM DO POETS
WRITE POETRY BUT BY A SORT OF GENIUS AND INSPIRATION THEY ARE LIKE
DIVINERS OR SOOTHSAYERS WHO ALSO SAY MANY FINE THINGS BUT DO NOT
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THEM
THE POETS APPEARED TO ME TO BE MUCH IN
THE SAME CASE AND I FURTHER OBSERVED THAT UPON THE STRENGTH OF THEIR
POETRY THEY BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE THE WISEST OF MEN IN OTHER THINGS
IN WHICH THEY WERE NOT WISE
SO I DEPARTED CONCEIVING MYSELF TO
BE SUPERIOR TO THEM FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I WAS SUPERIOR TO THE
POLITICIANS
AT LAST I WENT TO THE ARTISANS
I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT I KNEW NOTHING AT
ALL AS I MAY SAY AND I WAS SURE THAT THEY KNEW MANY FINE THINGS AND
HERE I WAS NOT MISTAKEN FOR THEY DID KNOW MANY THINGS OF WHICH I
WAS IGNORANT AND IN THIS THEY CERTAINLY WERE WISER THAN I WAS
BUT I
OBSERVED THAT EVEN THE GOOD ARTISANS FELL INTO THE SAME ERROR AS THE
POETS BECAUSE THEY WERE GOOD WORKMEN THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY ALSO KNEW
ALL SORTS OF HIGH MATTERS AND THIS DEFECT IN THEM OVERSHADOWED THEIR
WISDOM AND THEREFORE I ASKED MYSELF ON BEHALF OF THE ORACLE WHETHER
I WOULD LIKE TO BE AS I WAS NEITHER HAVING THEIR KNOWLEDGE NOR THEIR
IGNORANCE OR LIKE THEM IN BOTH AND I MADE ANSWER TO MYSELF AND TO THE
ORACLE THAT I WAS BETTER OFF AS I WAS
THIS INQUISITION HAS LED TO MY HAVING MANY ENEMIES OF THE WORST AND MOST
DANGEROUS KIND AND HAS GIVEN OCCASION ALSO TO MANY CALUMNIES
AND I
AM CALLED WISE FOR MY HEARERS ALWAYS IMAGINE THAT I MYSELF POSSESS
THE WISDOM WHICH I FIND WANTING IN OTHERS BUT THE TRUTH IS O MEN OF
ATHENS THAT GOD ONLY IS WISE AND BY HIS ANSWER HE INTENDS TO SHOW
THAT THE WISDOM OF MEN IS WORTH LITTLE OR NOTHING HE IS NOT SPEAKING
OF SOCRATES HE IS ONLY USING MY NAME BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION AS IF
HE SAID HE O MEN IS THE WISEST WHO LIKE SOCRATES KNOWS THAT HIS
WISDOM IS IN TRUTH WORTH NOTHING
AND SO I GO ABOUT THE WORLD OBEDIENT
TO THE GOD AND SEARCH AND MAKE ENQUIRY INTO THE WISDOM OF ANY ONE
WHETHER CITIZEN OR STRANGER WHO APPEARS TO BE WISE AND IF HE IS NOT
WISE THEN IN VINDICATION OF THE ORACLE I SHOW HIM THAT HE IS NOT WISE
AND MY OCCUPATION QUITE ABSORBS ME AND I HAVE NO TIME TO GIVE EITHER TO
ANY PUBLIC MATTER OF INTEREST OR TO ANY CONCERN OF MY OWN BUT I AM IN
UTTER POVERTY BY REASON OF MY DEVOTION TO THE GOD
THERE IS ANOTHER THING YOUNG MEN OF THE RICHER CLASSES WHO HAVE NOT
MUCH TO DO COME ABOUT ME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THEY LIKE TO HEAR THE
PRETENDERS EXAMINED AND THEY OFTEN IMITATE ME AND PROCEED TO EXAMINE
OTHERS THERE ARE PLENTY OF PERSONS AS THEY QUICKLY DISCOVER WHO THINK
THAT THEY KNOW SOMETHING BUT REALLY KNOW LITTLE OR NOTHING AND THEN
THOSE WHO ARE EXAMINED BY THEM INSTEAD OF BEING ANGRY WITH THEMSELVES
ARE ANGRY WITH ME THIS CONFOUNDED SOCRATES THEY SAY THIS VILLAINOUS
MISLEADER OF YOUTH AND THEN IF SOMEBODY ASKS THEM WHY WHAT EVIL DOES
HE PRACTISE OR TEACH THEY DO NOT KNOW AND CANNOT TELL BUT IN ORDER
THAT THEY MAY NOT APPEAR TO BE AT A LOSS THEY REPEAT THE READY MADE
CHARGES WHICH ARE USED AGAINST ALL PHILOSOPHERS ABOUT TEACHING THINGS
UP IN THE CLOUDS AND UNDER THE EARTH AND HAVING NO GODS AND MAKING
THE WORSE APPEAR THE BETTER CAUSE FOR THEY DO NOT LIKE TO CONFESS THAT
THEIR PRETENCE OF KNOWLEDGE HAS BEEN DETECTED WHICH IS THE TRUTH AND
AS THEY ARE NUMEROUS AND AMBITIOUS AND ENERGETIC AND ARE DRAWN UP IN
BATTLE ARRAY AND HAVE PERSUASIVE TONGUES THEY HAVE FILLED YOUR EARS
WITH THEIR LOUD AND INVETERATE CALUMNIES
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY MY
THREE ACCUSERS MELETUS AND ANYTUS AND LYCON HAVE SET UPON ME MELETUS
WHO HAS A QUARREL WITH ME ON BEHALF OF THE POETS ANYTUS ON BEHALF OF
THE CRAFTSMEN AND POLITICIANS LYCON ON BEHALF OF THE RHETORICIANS AND
AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING I CANNOT EXPECT TO GET RID OF SUCH A MASS OF
CALUMNY ALL IN A MOMENT
AND THIS O MEN OF ATHENS IS THE TRUTH AND THE
WHOLE TRUTH I HAVE CONCEALED NOTHING I HAVE DISSEMBLED NOTHING
AND
YET I KNOW THAT MY PLAINNESS OF SPEECH MAKES THEM HATE ME AND WHAT IS
THEIR HATRED BUT A PROOF THAT I AM SPEAKING THE TRUTH HENCE HAS ARISEN
THE PREJUDICE AGAINST ME AND THIS IS THE REASON OF IT AS YOU WILL FIND
OUT EITHER IN THIS OR IN ANY FUTURE ENQUIRY
I HAVE SAID ENOUGH IN MY DEFENCE AGAINST THE FIRST CLASS OF MY ACCUSERS
I TURN TO THE SECOND CLASS
THEY ARE HEADED BY MELETUS THAT GOOD MAN
AND TRUE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY AS HE CALLS HIMSELF
AGAINST THESE TOO
I MUST TRY TO MAKE A DEFENCE LET THEIR AFFIDAVIT BE READ IT CONTAINS
SOMETHING OF THIS KIND IT SAYS THAT SOCRATES IS A DOER OF EVIL WHO
CORRUPTS THE YOUTH AND WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE GODS OF THE STATE
BUT HAS OTHER NEW DIVINITIES OF HIS OWN
SUCH IS THE CHARGE AND NOW LET
US EXAMINE THE PARTICULAR COUNTS
HE SAYS THAT I AM A DOER OF EVIL AND
CORRUPT THE YOUTH BUT I SAY O MEN OF ATHENS THAT MELETUS IS A DOER OF
EVIL IN THAT HE PRETENDS TO BE IN EARNEST WHEN HE IS ONLY IN JEST AND
IS SO EAGER TO BRING MEN TO TRIAL FROM A PRETENDED ZEAL AND INTEREST
ABOUT MATTERS IN WHICH HE REALLY NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST INTEREST
AND
THE TRUTH OF THIS I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE TO YOU
COME HITHER MELETUS AND LET ME ASK A QUESTION OF YOU
YOU THINK A
GREAT DEAL ABOUT THE IMPROVEMENT OF YOUTH
YES I DO
TELL THE JUDGES THEN WHO IS THEIR IMPROVER FOR YOU MUST KNOW AS YOU
HAVE TAKEN THE PAINS TO DISCOVER THEIR CORRUPTER AND ARE CITING AND
ACCUSING ME BEFORE THEM
SPEAK THEN AND TELL THE JUDGES WHO THEIR
IMPROVER IS OBSERVE MELETUS THAT YOU ARE SILENT AND HAVE NOTHING TO
SAY
BUT IS NOT THIS RATHER DISGRACEFUL AND A VERY CONSIDERABLE PROOF
OF WHAT I WAS SAYING THAT YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE MATTER SPEAK UP
FRIEND AND TELL US WHO THEIR IMPROVER IS
THE LAWS
BUT THAT MY GOOD SIR IS NOT MY MEANING
I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE PERSON
IS WHO IN THE FIRST PLACE KNOWS THE LAWS
THE JUDGES SOCRATES WHO ARE PRESENT IN COURT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY MELETUS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO INSTRUCT AND
IMPROVE YOUTH
CERTAINLY THEY ARE
WHAT ALL OF THEM OR SOME ONLY AND NOT OTHERS
ALL OF THEM
BY THE GODDESS HERE THAT IS GOOD NEWS THERE ARE PLENTY OF IMPROVERS
THEN
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OF THE AUDIENCE DO THEY IMPROVE THEM
YES THEY DO
AND THE SENATORS
YES THE SENATORS IMPROVE THEM
BUT PERHAPS THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY CORRUPT THEM OR DO THEY TOO
IMPROVE THEM
THEY IMPROVE THEM
THEN EVERY ATHENIAN IMPROVES AND ELEVATES THEM ALL WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF MYSELF AND I ALONE AM THEIR CORRUPTER IS THAT WHAT YOU AFFIRM
THAT IS WHAT I STOUTLY AFFIRM
I AM VERY UNFORTUNATE IF YOU ARE RIGHT
BUT SUPPOSE I ASK YOU A
QUESTION HOW ABOUT HORSES DOES ONE MAN DO THEM HARM AND ALL THE WORLD
GOOD IS NOT THE EXACT OPPOSITE THE TRUTH ONE MAN IS ABLE TO DO THEM
GOOD OR AT LEAST NOT MANY THE TRAINER OF HORSES THAT IS TO SAY DOES
THEM GOOD AND OTHERS WHO HAVE TO DO WITH THEM RATHER INJURE THEM
IS NOT THAT TRUE MELETUS OF HORSES OR OF ANY OTHER ANIMALS MOST
ASSUREDLY IT IS WHETHER YOU AND ANYTUS SAY YES OR NO
HAPPY INDEED
WOULD BE THE CONDITION OF YOUTH IF THEY HAD ONE CORRUPTER ONLY AND
ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD WERE THEIR IMPROVERS
BUT YOU MELETUS HAVE
SUFFICIENTLY SHOWN THAT YOU NEVER HAD A THOUGHT ABOUT THE YOUNG YOUR
CARELESSNESS IS SEEN IN YOUR NOT CARING ABOUT THE VERY THINGS WHICH YOU
BRING AGAINST ME
AND NOW MELETUS I WILL ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION BY ZEUS I WILL
WHICH IS BETTER TO LIVE AMONG BAD CITIZENS OR AMONG GOOD ONES ANSWER
FRIEND I SAY THE QUESTION IS ONE WHICH MAY BE EASILY ANSWERED
DO NOT
THE GOOD DO THEIR NEIGHBOURS GOOD AND THE BAD DO THEM EVIL
CERTAINLY
AND IS THERE ANYONE WHO WOULD RATHER BE INJURED THAN BENEFITED BY THOSE
WHO LIVE WITH HIM ANSWER MY GOOD FRIEND THE LAW REQUIRES YOU TO
ANSWER DOES ANY ONE LIKE TO BE INJURED
CERTAINLY NOT
AND WHEN YOU ACCUSE ME OF CORRUPTING AND DETERIORATING THE YOUTH DO YOU
ALLEGE THAT I CORRUPT THEM INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY
INTENTIONALLY I SAY
BUT YOU HAVE JUST ADMITTED THAT THE GOOD DO THEIR NEIGHBOURS GOOD AND
THE EVIL DO THEM EVIL
NOW IS THAT A TRUTH WHICH YOUR SUPERIOR WISDOM
HAS RECOGNIZED THUS EARLY IN LIFE AND AM I AT MY AGE IN SUCH DARKNESS
AND IGNORANCE AS NOT TO KNOW THAT IF A MAN WITH WHOM I HAVE TO LIVE IS
CORRUPTED BY ME I AM VERY LIKELY TO BE HARMED BY HIM AND YET I CORRUPT
HIM AND INTENTIONALLY TOO SO YOU SAY ALTHOUGH NEITHER I NOR ANY
OTHER HUMAN BEING IS EVER LIKELY TO BE CONVINCED BY YOU
BUT EITHER I DO
NOT CORRUPT THEM OR I CORRUPT THEM UNINTENTIONALLY AND ON EITHER VIEW
OF THE CASE YOU LIE
IF MY OFFENCE IS UNINTENTIONAL THE LAW HAS
NO COGNIZANCE OF UNINTENTIONAL OFFENCES YOU OUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN ME
PRIVATELY AND WARNED AND ADMONISHED ME FOR IF I HAD BEEN
BETTER ADVISED I SHOULD HAVE LEFT OFF DOING WHAT I ONLY DID
UNINTENTIONALLY NO DOUBT I SHOULD BUT YOU WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO
ME AND REFUSED TO TEACH ME
AND NOW YOU BRING ME UP IN THIS COURT WHICH
IS A PLACE NOT OF INSTRUCTION BUT OF PUNISHMENT
IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR TO YOU ATHENIANS AS I WAS SAYING THAT MELETUS
HAS NO CARE AT ALL GREAT OR SMALL ABOUT THE MATTER
BUT STILL I SHOULD
LIKE TO KNOW MELETUS IN WHAT I AM AFFIRMED TO CORRUPT THE YOUNG
I
SUPPOSE YOU MEAN AS I INFER FROM YOUR INDICTMENT THAT I TEACH THEM NOT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GODS WHICH THE STATE ACKNOWLEDGES BUT SOME OTHER NEW
DIVINITIES OR SPIRITUAL AGENCIES IN THEIR STEAD
THESE ARE THE LESSONS
BY WHICH I CORRUPT THE YOUTH AS YOU SAY
YES THAT I SAY EMPHATICALLY
THEN BY THE GODS MELETUS OF WHOM WE ARE SPEAKING TELL ME AND THE
COURT IN SOMEWHAT PLAINER TERMS WHAT YOU MEAN FOR I DO NOT AS YET
UNDERSTAND WHETHER YOU AFFIRM THAT I TEACH OTHER MEN TO ACKNOWLEDGE
SOME GODS AND THEREFORE THAT I DO BELIEVE IN GODS AND AM NOT AN ENTIRE
ATHEIST THIS YOU DO NOT LAY TO MY CHARGE BUT ONLY YOU SAY THAT THEY
ARE NOT THE SAME GODS WHICH THE CITY RECOGNIZES THE CHARGE IS THAT THEY
ARE DIFFERENT GODS
OR DO YOU MEAN THAT I AM AN ATHEIST SIMPLY AND A
TEACHER OF ATHEISM
I MEAN THE LATTER THAT YOU ARE A COMPLETE ATHEIST
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY STATEMENT WHY DO YOU THINK SO MELETUS DO YOU
MEAN THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE GODHEAD OF THE SUN OR MOON LIKE OTHER
MEN
I ASSURE YOU JUDGES THAT HE DOES NOT FOR HE SAYS THAT THE SUN IS
STONE AND THE MOON EARTH
FRIEND MELETUS YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE ACCUSING ANAXAGORAS AND YOU HAVE
BUT A BAD OPINION OF THE JUDGES IF YOU FANCY THEM ILLITERATE TO SUCH
A DEGREE AS NOT TO KNOW THAT THESE DOCTRINES ARE FOUND IN THE BOOKS OF
ANAXAGORAS THE CLAZOMENIAN WHICH ARE FULL OF THEM
AND SO FORSOOTH
THE YOUTH ARE SAID TO BE TAUGHT THEM BY SOCRATES WHEN THERE ARE NOT
UNFREQUENTLY EXHIBITIONS OF THEM AT THE THEATRE PROBABLY IN ALLUSION TO
ARISTOPHANES WHO CARICATURED AND TO EURIPIDES WHO BORROWED THE NOTIONS
OF ANAXAGORAS AS WELL AS TO OTHER DRAMATIC POETS PRICE OF ADMISSION
ONE DRACHMA AT THE MOST AND THEY MIGHT PAY THEIR MONEY AND LAUGH AT
SOCRATES IF HE PRETENDS TO FATHER THESE EXTRAORDINARY VIEWS
AND SO
MELETUS YOU REALLY THINK THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IN ANY GOD
I SWEAR BY ZEUS THAT YOU BELIEVE ABSOLUTELY IN NONE AT ALL
NOBODY WILL BELIEVE YOU MELETUS AND I AM PRETTY SURE THAT YOU DO NOT
BELIEVE YOURSELF
I CANNOT HELP THINKING MEN OF ATHENS THAT MELETUS
IS RECKLESS AND IMPUDENT AND THAT HE HAS WRITTEN THIS INDICTMENT IN A
SPIRIT OF MERE WANTONNESS AND YOUTHFUL BRAVADO
HAS HE NOT COMPOUNDED A
RIDDLE THINKING TO TRY ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF I SHALL SEE WHETHER
THE WISE SOCRATES WILL DISCOVER MY FACETIOUS CONTRADICTION OR WHETHER I
SHALL BE ABLE TO DECEIVE HIM AND THE REST OF THEM
FOR HE CERTAINLY DOES
APPEAR TO ME TO CONTRADICT HIMSELF IN THE INDICTMENT AS MUCH AS IF HE
SAID THAT SOCRATES IS GUILTY OF NOT BELIEVING IN THE GODS AND YET OF
BELIEVING IN THEM BUT THIS IS NOT LIKE A PERSON WHO IS IN EARNEST
I SHOULD LIKE YOU O MEN OF ATHENS TO JOIN ME IN EXAMINING WHAT I
CONCEIVE TO BE HIS INCONSISTENCY AND DO YOU MELETUS ANSWER
AND
I MUST REMIND THE AUDIENCE OF MY REQUEST THAT THEY WOULD NOT MAKE A
DISTURBANCE IF I SPEAK IN MY ACCUSTOMED MANNER
DID EVER MAN MELETUS BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF HUMAN THINGS AND NOT
OF HUMAN BEINGS I WISH MEN OF ATHENS THAT HE WOULD ANSWER AND NOT
BE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET UP AN INTERRUPTION
DID EVER ANY MAN BELIEVE
IN HORSEMANSHIP AND NOT IN HORSES OR IN FLUTE PLAYING AND NOT IN
FLUTE PLAYERS NO MY FRIEND I WILL ANSWER TO YOU AND TO THE COURT AS
YOU REFUSE TO ANSWER FOR YOURSELF
THERE IS NO MAN WHO EVER DID
BUT NOW
PLEASE TO ANSWER THE NEXT QUESTION CAN A MAN BELIEVE IN SPIRITUAL AND
DIVINE AGENCIES AND NOT IN SPIRITS OR DEMIGODS
HE CANNOT
HOW LUCKY I AM TO HAVE EXTRACTED THAT ANSWER BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE
COURT BUT THEN YOU SWEAR IN THE INDICTMENT THAT I TEACH AND BELIEVE IN
DIVINE OR SPIRITUAL AGENCIES NEW OR OLD NO MATTER FOR THAT AT ANY
RATE I BELIEVE IN SPIRITUAL AGENCIES SO YOU SAY AND SWEAR IN THE
AFFIDAVIT AND YET IF I BELIEVE IN DIVINE BEINGS HOW CAN I HELP
BELIEVING IN SPIRITS OR DEMIGODS MUST I NOT TO BE SURE I MUST AND
THEREFORE I MAY ASSUME THAT YOUR SILENCE GIVES CONSENT
NOW WHAT ARE
SPIRITS OR DEMIGODS ARE THEY NOT EITHER GODS OR THE SONS OF GODS
CERTAINLY THEY ARE
BUT THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE FACETIOUS RIDDLE INVENTED BY YOU THE
DEMIGODS OR SPIRITS ARE GODS AND YOU SAY FIRST THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IN
GODS AND THEN AGAIN THAT I DO BELIEVE IN GODS THAT IS IF I BELIEVE IN
DEMIGODS
FOR IF THE DEMIGODS ARE THE ILLEGITIMATE SONS OF GODS WHETHER
BY THE NYMPHS OR BY ANY OTHER MOTHERS OF WHOM THEY ARE SAID TO BE THE
SONS WHAT HUMAN BEING WILL EVER BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO GODS IF THEY
ARE THE SONS OF GODS YOU MIGHT AS WELL AFFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF MULES
AND DENY THAT OF HORSES AND ASSES
SUCH NONSENSE MELETUS COULD ONLY
HAVE BEEN INTENDED BY YOU TO MAKE TRIAL OF ME
YOU HAVE PUT THIS INTO
THE INDICTMENT BECAUSE YOU HAD NOTHING REAL OF WHICH TO ACCUSE ME
BUT
NO ONE WHO HAS A PARTICLE OF UNDERSTANDING WILL EVER BE CONVINCED BY YOU
THAT THE SAME MEN CAN BELIEVE IN DIVINE AND SUPERHUMAN THINGS AND YET
NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE GODS AND DEMIGODS AND HEROES
I HAVE SAID ENOUGH IN ANSWER TO THE CHARGE OF MELETUS ANY ELABORATE
DEFENCE IS UNNECESSARY BUT I KNOW ONLY TOO WELL HOW MANY ARE THE
ENMITIES WHICH I HAVE INCURRED AND THIS IS WHAT WILL BE MY DESTRUCTION
IF I AM DESTROYED NOT MELETUS NOR YET ANYTUS BUT THE ENVY AND
DETRACTION OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN THE DEATH OF MANY GOOD MEN AND
WILL PROBABLY BE THE DEATH OF MANY MORE THERE IS NO DANGER OF MY BEING
THE LAST OF THEM
SOME ONE WILL SAY AND ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED SOCRATES OF A COURSE OF
LIFE WHICH IS LIKELY TO BRING YOU TO AN UNTIMELY END TO HIM I MAY
FAIRLY ANSWER THERE YOU ARE MISTAKEN A MAN WHO IS GOOD FOR ANYTHING
OUGHT NOT TO CALCULATE THE CHANCE OF LIVING OR DYING HE OUGHT ONLY TO
CONSIDER WHETHER IN DOING ANYTHING HE IS DOING RIGHT OR WRONG ACTING
THE PART OF A GOOD MAN OR OF A BAD
WHEREAS UPON YOUR VIEW THE HEROES
WHO FELL AT TROY WERE NOT GOOD FOR MUCH AND THE SON OF THETIS ABOVE
ALL WHO ALTOGETHER DESPISED DANGER IN COMPARISON WITH DISGRACE AND
WHEN HE WAS SO EAGER TO SLAY HECTOR HIS GODDESS MOTHER SAID TO HIM
THAT IF HE AVENGED HIS COMPANION PATROCLUS AND SLEW HECTOR HE WOULD
DIE HIMSELF 'FATE SHE SAID IN THESE OR THE LIKE WORDS 'WAITS FOR
YOU NEXT AFTER HECTOR HE RECEIVING THIS WARNING UTTERLY DESPISED
DANGER AND DEATH AND INSTEAD OF FEARING THEM FEARED RATHER TO LIVE
IN DISHONOUR AND NOT TO AVENGE HIS FRIEND
'LET ME DIE FORTHWITH
HE REPLIES 'AND BE AVENGED OF MY ENEMY RATHER THAN ABIDE HERE BY THE
BEAKED SHIPS A LAUGHING STOCK AND A BURDEN OF THE EARTH HAD ACHILLES
ANY THOUGHT OF DEATH AND DANGER FOR WHEREVER A MAN'S PLACE IS WHETHER
THE PLACE WHICH HE HAS CHOSEN OR THAT IN WHICH HE HAS BEEN PLACED BY A
COMMANDER THERE HE OUGHT TO REMAIN IN THE HOUR OF DANGER HE SHOULD
NOT THINK OF DEATH OR OF ANYTHING BUT OF DISGRACE
AND THIS O MEN OF
ATHENS IS A TRUE SAYING
STRANGE INDEED WOULD BE MY CONDUCT O MEN OF ATHENS IF I WHO WHEN I
WAS ORDERED BY THE GENERALS WHOM YOU CHOSE TO COMMAND ME AT POTIDAEA
AND AMPHIPOLIS AND DELIUM REMAINED WHERE THEY PLACED ME LIKE ANY OTHER
MAN FACING DEATH IF NOW WHEN AS I CONCEIVE AND IMAGINE GOD ORDERS
ME TO FULFIL THE PHILOSOPHER'S MISSION OF SEARCHING INTO MYSELF AND
OTHER MEN I WERE TO DESERT MY POST THROUGH FEAR OF DEATH OR ANY OTHER
FEAR THAT WOULD INDEED BE STRANGE AND I MIGHT JUSTLY BE ARRAIGNED IN
COURT FOR DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF THE GODS IF I DISOBEYED THE ORACLE
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF DEATH FANCYING THAT I WAS WISE WHEN I WAS NOT
WISE
FOR THE FEAR OF DEATH IS INDEED THE PRETENCE OF WISDOM AND NOT
REAL WISDOM BEING A PRETENCE OF KNOWING THE UNKNOWN AND NO ONE KNOWS
WHETHER DEATH WHICH MEN IN THEIR FEAR APPREHEND TO BE THE GREATEST
EVIL MAY NOT BE THE GREATEST GOOD
IS NOT THIS IGNORANCE OF A
DISGRACEFUL SORT THE IGNORANCE WHICH IS THE CONCEIT THAT A MAN KNOWS
WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW AND IN THIS RESPECT ONLY I BELIEVE MYSELF TO
DIFFER FROM MEN IN GENERAL AND MAY PERHAPS CLAIM TO BE WISER THAN
THEY ARE THAT WHEREAS I KNOW BUT LITTLE OF THE WORLD BELOW I DO NOT
SUPPOSE THAT I KNOW BUT I DO KNOW THAT INJUSTICE AND DISOBEDIENCE TO A
BETTER WHETHER GOD OR MAN IS EVIL AND DISHONOURABLE AND I WILL NEVER
FEAR OR AVOID A POSSIBLE GOOD RATHER THAN A CERTAIN EVIL
AND THEREFORE
IF YOU LET ME GO NOW AND ARE NOT CONVINCED BY ANYTUS WHO SAID THAT
SINCE I HAD BEEN PROSECUTED I MUST BE PUT TO DEATH OR IF NOT THAT I
OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED AT ALL AND THAT IF I ESCAPE NOW
YOUR SONS WILL ALL BE UTTERLY RUINED BY LISTENING TO MY WORDS IF YOU
SAY TO ME SOCRATES THIS TIME WE WILL NOT MIND ANYTUS AND YOU SHALL
BE LET OFF BUT UPON ONE CONDITION THAT YOU ARE NOT TO ENQUIRE AND
SPECULATE IN THIS WAY ANY MORE AND THAT IF YOU ARE CAUGHT DOING SO
AGAIN YOU SHALL DIE IF THIS WAS THE CONDITION ON WHICH YOU LET ME GO
I SHOULD REPLY MEN OF ATHENS I HONOUR AND LOVE YOU BUT I SHALL OBEY
GOD RATHER THAN YOU AND WHILE I HAVE LIFE AND STRENGTH I SHALL NEVER
CEASE FROM THE PRACTICE AND TEACHING OF PHILOSOPHY EXHORTING ANY
ONE WHOM I MEET AND SAYING TO HIM AFTER MY MANNER YOU MY FRIEND A
CITIZEN OF THE GREAT AND MIGHTY AND WISE CITY OF ATHENS ARE YOU
NOT ASHAMED OF HEAPING UP THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF MONEY AND HONOUR AND
REPUTATION AND CARING SO LITTLE ABOUT WISDOM AND TRUTH AND THE GREATEST
IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOUL WHICH YOU NEVER REGARD OR HEED AT ALL AND IF
THE PERSON WITH WHOM I AM ARGUING SAYS YES BUT I DO CARE THEN I DO
NOT LEAVE HIM OR LET HIM GO AT ONCE BUT I PROCEED TO INTERROGATE AND
EXAMINE AND CROSS EXAMINE HIM AND IF I THINK THAT HE HAS NO VIRTUE IN
HIM BUT ONLY SAYS THAT HE HAS I REPROACH HIM WITH UNDERVALUING THE
GREATER AND OVERVALUING THE LESS
AND I SHALL REPEAT THE SAME WORDS TO
EVERY ONE WHOM I MEET YOUNG AND OLD CITIZEN AND ALIEN BUT ESPECIALLY
TO THE CITIZENS INASMUCH AS THEY ARE MY BRETHREN
FOR KNOW THAT THIS IS
THE COMMAND OF GOD AND I BELIEVE THAT NO GREATER GOOD HAS EVER HAPPENED
IN THE STATE THAN MY SERVICE TO THE GOD
FOR I DO NOTHING BUT GO ABOUT
PERSUADING YOU ALL OLD AND YOUNG ALIKE NOT TO TAKE THOUGHT FOR YOUR
PERSONS OR YOUR PROPERTIES BUT FIRST AND CHIEFLY TO CARE ABOUT THE
GREATEST IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOUL
I TELL YOU THAT VIRTUE IS NOT GIVEN
BY MONEY BUT THAT FROM VIRTUE COMES MONEY AND EVERY OTHER GOOD OF
MAN PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE
THIS IS MY TEACHING AND IF THIS IS THE
DOCTRINE WHICH CORRUPTS THE YOUTH I AM A MISCHIEVOUS PERSON
BUT IF
ANY ONE SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT MY TEACHING HE IS SPEAKING AN UNTRUTH
WHEREFORE O MEN OF ATHENS I SAY TO YOU DO AS ANYTUS BIDS OR NOT
AS ANYTUS BIDS AND EITHER ACQUIT ME OR NOT BUT WHICHEVER YOU DO
UNDERSTAND THAT I SHALL NEVER ALTER MY WAYS NOT EVEN IF I HAVE TO DIE
MANY TIMES
MEN OF ATHENS DO NOT INTERRUPT BUT HEAR ME THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN US THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR ME TO THE END I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO
SAY AT WHICH YOU MAY BE INCLINED TO CRY OUT BUT I BELIEVE THAT TO HEAR
ME WILL BE GOOD FOR YOU AND THEREFORE I BEG THAT YOU WILL NOT CRY OUT
I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU KILL SUCH AN ONE AS I AM YOU WILL
INJURE YOURSELVES MORE THAN YOU WILL INJURE ME
NOTHING WILL INJURE ME
NOT MELETUS NOR YET ANYTUS THEY CANNOT FOR A BAD MAN IS NOT PERMITTED
TO INJURE A BETTER THAN HIMSELF
I DO NOT DENY THAT ANYTUS MAY PERHAPS
KILL HIM OR DRIVE HIM INTO EXILE OR DEPRIVE HIM OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND
HE MAY IMAGINE AND OTHERS MAY IMAGINE THAT HE IS INFLICTING A GREAT
INJURY UPON HIM BUT THERE I DO NOT AGREE
FOR THE EVIL OF DOING AS
HE IS DOING THE EVIL OF UNJUSTLY TAKING AWAY THE LIFE OF ANOTHER IS
GREATER FAR
AND NOW ATHENIANS I AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE FOR MY OWN SAKE AS YOU MAY
THINK BUT FOR YOURS THAT YOU MAY NOT SIN AGAINST THE GOD BY CONDEMNING
ME WHO AM HIS GIFT TO YOU
FOR IF YOU KILL ME YOU WILL NOT EASILY FIND
A SUCCESSOR TO ME WHO IF I MAY USE SUCH A LUDICROUS FIGURE OF SPEECH
AM A SORT OF GADFLY GIVEN TO THE STATE BY GOD AND THE STATE IS A GREAT
AND NOBLE STEED WHO IS TARDY IN HIS MOTIONS OWING TO HIS VERY SIZE
AND REQUIRES TO BE STIRRED INTO LIFE
I AM THAT GADFLY WHICH GOD HAS
ATTACHED TO THE STATE AND ALL DAY LONG AND IN ALL PLACES AM ALWAYS
FASTENING UPON YOU AROUSING AND PERSUADING AND REPROACHING YOU
YOU
WILL NOT EASILY FIND ANOTHER LIKE ME AND THEREFORE I WOULD ADVISE YOU
TO SPARE ME
I DARE SAY THAT YOU MAY FEEL OUT OF TEMPER LIKE A PERSON
WHO IS SUDDENLY AWAKENED FROM SLEEP AND YOU THINK THAT YOU MIGHT
EASILY STRIKE ME DEAD AS ANYTUS ADVISES AND THEN YOU WOULD SLEEP ON
FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR LIVES UNLESS GOD IN HIS CARE OF YOU SENT YOU
ANOTHER GADFLY
WHEN I SAY THAT I AM GIVEN TO YOU BY GOD THE PROOF OF
MY MISSION IS THIS IF I HAD BEEN LIKE OTHER MEN I SHOULD NOT HAVE
NEGLECTED ALL MY OWN CONCERNS OR PATIENTLY SEEN THE NEGLECT OF THEM
DURING ALL THESE YEARS AND HAVE BEEN DOING YOURS COMING TO YOU
INDIVIDUALLY LIKE A FATHER OR ELDER BROTHER EXHORTING YOU TO REGARD
VIRTUE SUCH CONDUCT I SAY WOULD BE UNLIKE HUMAN NATURE
IF I HAD
GAINED ANYTHING OR IF MY EXHORTATIONS HAD BEEN PAID THERE WOULD HAVE
BEEN SOME SENSE IN MY DOING SO BUT NOW AS YOU WILL PERCEIVE NOT EVEN
THE IMPUDENCE OF MY ACCUSERS DARES TO SAY THAT I HAVE EVER EXACTED
OR SOUGHT PAY OF ANY ONE OF THAT THEY HAVE NO WITNESS
AND I HAVE A
SUFFICIENT WITNESS TO THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SAY MY POVERTY
SOME ONE MAY WONDER WHY I GO ABOUT IN PRIVATE GIVING ADVICE AND BUSYING
MYSELF WITH THE CONCERNS OF OTHERS BUT DO NOT VENTURE TO COME FORWARD
IN PUBLIC AND ADVISE THE STATE
I WILL TELL YOU WHY
YOU HAVE HEARD ME
SPEAK AT SUNDRY TIMES AND IN DIVERS PLACES OF AN ORACLE OR SIGN
WHICH COMES TO ME AND IS THE DIVINITY WHICH MELETUS RIDICULES IN THE
INDICTMENT
THIS SIGN WHICH IS A KIND OF VOICE FIRST BEGAN TO COME
TO ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD IT ALWAYS FORBIDS BUT NEVER COMMANDS ME TO
DO ANYTHING WHICH I AM GOING TO DO
THIS IS WHAT DETERS ME FROM BEING A
POLITICIAN
AND RIGHTLY AS I THINK
FOR I AM CERTAIN O MEN OF ATHENS
THAT IF I HAD ENGAGED IN POLITICS I SHOULD HAVE PERISHED LONG AGO AND
DONE NO GOOD EITHER TO YOU OR TO MYSELF
AND DO NOT BE OFFENDED AT MY
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH FOR THE TRUTH IS THAT NO MAN WHO GOES TO WAR
WITH YOU OR ANY OTHER MULTITUDE HONESTLY STRIVING AGAINST THE MANY
LAWLESS AND UNRIGHTEOUS DEEDS WHICH ARE DONE IN A STATE WILL SAVE HIS
LIFE HE WHO WILL FIGHT FOR THE RIGHT IF HE WOULD LIVE EVEN FOR A BRIEF
SPACE MUST HAVE A PRIVATE STATION AND NOT A PUBLIC ONE
I CAN GIVE YOU CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF WHAT I SAY NOT WORDS ONLY BUT
WHAT YOU VALUE FAR MORE ACTIONS
LET ME RELATE TO YOU A PASSAGE OF MY
OWN LIFE WHICH WILL PROVE TO YOU THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE YIELDED TO
INJUSTICE FROM ANY FEAR OF DEATH AND THAT 'AS I SHOULD HAVE REFUSED TO
YIELD' I MUST HAVE DIED AT ONCE
I WILL TELL YOU A TALE OF THE COURTS
NOT VERY INTERESTING PERHAPS BUT NEVERTHELESS TRUE
THE ONLY OFFICE OF
STATE WHICH I EVER HELD O MEN OF ATHENS WAS THAT OF SENATOR THE TRIBE
ANTIOCHIS WHICH IS MY TRIBE HAD THE PRESIDENCY AT THE TRIAL OF THE
GENERALS WHO HAD NOT TAKEN UP THE BODIES OF THE SLAIN AFTER THE BATTLE
OF ARGINUSAE AND YOU PROPOSED TO TRY THEM IN A BODY CONTRARY TO LAW
AS YOU ALL THOUGHT AFTERWARDS BUT AT THE TIME I WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE
PRYTANES WHO WAS OPPOSED TO THE ILLEGALITY AND I GAVE MY VOTE AGAINST
YOU AND WHEN THE ORATORS THREATENED TO IMPEACH AND ARREST ME AND YOU
CALLED AND SHOUTED I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WOULD RUN THE RISK HAVING
LAW AND JUSTICE WITH ME RATHER THAN TAKE PART IN YOUR INJUSTICE BECAUSE
I FEARED IMPRISONMENT AND DEATH
THIS HAPPENED IN THE DAYS OF THE
DEMOCRACY
BUT WHEN THE OLIGARCHY OF THE THIRTY WAS IN POWER THEY SENT
FOR ME AND FOUR OTHERS INTO THE ROTUNDA AND BADE US BRING LEON THE
SALAMINIAN FROM SALAMIS AS THEY WANTED TO PUT HIM TO DEATH
THIS WAS A
SPECIMEN OF THE SORT OF COMMANDS WHICH THEY WERE ALWAYS GIVING WITH
THE VIEW OF IMPLICATING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE IN THEIR CRIMES AND THEN I
SHOWED NOT IN WORD ONLY BUT IN DEED THAT IF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO USE
SUCH AN EXPRESSION I CARED NOT A STRAW FOR DEATH AND THAT MY GREAT AND
ONLY CARE WAS LEST I SHOULD DO AN UNRIGHTEOUS OR UNHOLY THING
FOR
THE STRONG ARM OF THAT OPPRESSIVE POWER DID NOT FRIGHTEN ME INTO DOING
WRONG AND WHEN WE CAME OUT OF THE ROTUNDA THE OTHER FOUR WENT TO
SALAMIS AND FETCHED LEON BUT I WENT QUIETLY HOME
FOR WHICH I MIGHT
HAVE LOST MY LIFE HAD NOT THE POWER OF THE THIRTY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS
COME TO AN END
AND MANY WILL WITNESS TO MY WORDS
NOW DO YOU REALLY IMAGINE THAT I COULD HAVE SURVIVED ALL THESE YEARS
IF I HAD LED A PUBLIC LIFE SUPPOSING THAT LIKE A GOOD MAN I HAD ALWAYS
MAINTAINED THE RIGHT AND HAD MADE JUSTICE AS I OUGHT THE FIRST THING
NO INDEED MEN OF ATHENS NEITHER I NOR ANY OTHER MAN
BUT I HAVE BEEN
ALWAYS THE SAME IN ALL MY ACTIONS PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE AND NEVER
HAVE I YIELDED ANY BASE COMPLIANCE TO THOSE WHO ARE SLANDEROUSLY TERMED
MY DISCIPLES OR TO ANY OTHER
NOT THAT I HAVE ANY REGULAR DISCIPLES
BUT IF ANY ONE LIKES TO COME AND HEAR ME WHILE I AM PURSUING MY MISSION
WHETHER HE BE YOUNG OR OLD HE IS NOT EXCLUDED
NOR DO I CONVERSE ONLY
WITH THOSE WHO PAY BUT ANY ONE WHETHER HE BE RICH OR POOR MAY ASK AND
ANSWER ME AND LISTEN TO MY WORDS AND WHETHER HE TURNS OUT TO BE A BAD
MAN OR A GOOD ONE NEITHER RESULT CAN BE JUSTLY IMPUTED TO ME FOR I
NEVER TAUGHT OR PROFESSED TO TEACH HIM ANYTHING
AND IF ANY ONE SAYS
THAT HE HAS EVER LEARNED OR HEARD ANYTHING FROM ME IN PRIVATE WHICH ALL
THE WORLD HAS NOT HEARD LET ME TELL YOU THAT HE IS LYING
BUT I SHALL BE ASKED WHY DO PEOPLE DELIGHT IN CONTINUALLY CONVERSING
WITH YOU I HAVE TOLD YOU ALREADY ATHENIANS THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT THIS
MATTER THEY LIKE TO HEAR THE CROSS EXAMINATION OF THE PRETENDERS TO
WISDOM THERE IS AMUSEMENT IN IT
NOW THIS DUTY OF CROSS EXAMINING OTHER
MEN HAS BEEN IMPOSED UPON ME BY GOD AND HAS BEEN SIGNIFIED TO ME BY
ORACLES VISIONS AND IN EVERY WAY IN WHICH THE WILL OF DIVINE POWER WAS
EVER INTIMATED TO ANY ONE
THIS IS TRUE O ATHENIANS OR IF NOT TRUE
WOULD BE SOON REFUTED
IF I AM OR HAVE BEEN CORRUPTING THE YOUTH THOSE
OF THEM WHO ARE NOW GROWN UP AND HAVE BECOME SENSIBLE THAT I GAVE THEM
BAD ADVICE IN THE DAYS OF THEIR YOUTH SHOULD COME FORWARD AS ACCUSERS
AND TAKE THEIR REVENGE OR IF THEY DO NOT LIKE TO COME THEMSELVES SOME
OF THEIR RELATIVES FATHERS BROTHERS OR OTHER KINSMEN SHOULD SAY WHAT
EVIL THEIR FAMILIES HAVE SUFFERED AT MY HANDS
NOW IS THEIR TIME
MANY
OF THEM I SEE IN THE COURT
THERE IS CRITO WHO IS OF THE SAME AGE AND
OF THE SAME DEME WITH MYSELF AND THERE IS CRITOBULUS HIS SON WHOM I
ALSO SEE
THEN AGAIN THERE IS LYSANIAS OF SPHETTUS WHO IS THE FATHER OF
AESCHINES HE IS PRESENT AND ALSO THERE IS ANTIPHON OF CEPHISUS WHO IS
THE FATHER OF EPIGENES AND THERE ARE THE BROTHERS OF SEVERAL WHO HAVE
ASSOCIATED WITH ME
THERE IS NICOSTRATUS THE SON OF THEOSDOTIDES AND
THE BROTHER OF THEODOTUS NOW THEODOTUS HIMSELF IS DEAD AND THEREFORE
HE AT ANY RATE WILL NOT SEEK TO STOP HIM AND THERE IS PARALUS THE
SON OF DEMODOCUS WHO HAD A BROTHER THEAGES AND ADEIMANTUS THE SON OF
ARISTON WHOSE BROTHER PLATO IS PRESENT AND AEANTODORUS WHO IS THE
BROTHER OF APOLLODORUS WHOM I ALSO SEE
I MIGHT MENTION A GREAT MANY
OTHERS SOME OF WHOM MELETUS SHOULD HAVE PRODUCED AS WITNESSES IN
THE COURSE OF HIS SPEECH AND LET HIM STILL PRODUCE THEM IF HE HAS
FORGOTTEN I WILL MAKE WAY FOR HIM
AND LET HIM SAY IF HE HAS ANY
TESTIMONY OF THE SORT WHICH HE CAN PRODUCE
NAY ATHENIANS THE VERY
OPPOSITE IS THE TRUTH
FOR ALL THESE ARE READY TO WITNESS ON BEHALF OF
THE CORRUPTER OF THE INJURER OF THEIR KINDRED AS MELETUS AND ANYTUS
CALL ME NOT THE CORRUPTED YOUTH ONLY THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE
FOR THAT BUT THEIR UNCORRUPTED ELDER RELATIVES
WHY SHOULD THEY TOO
SUPPORT ME WITH THEIR TESTIMONY WHY INDEED EXCEPT FOR THE SAKE OF
TRUTH AND JUSTICE AND BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT I AM SPEAKING THE TRUTH
AND THAT MELETUS IS A LIAR
WELL ATHENIANS THIS AND THE LIKE OF THIS IS ALL THE DEFENCE WHICH I
HAVE TO OFFER
YET A WORD MORE
PERHAPS THERE MAY BE SOME ONE WHO IS
OFFENDED AT ME WHEN HE CALLS TO MIND HOW HE HIMSELF ON A SIMILAR OR
EVEN A LESS SERIOUS OCCASION PRAYED AND ENTREATED THE JUDGES WITH MANY
TEARS AND HOW HE PRODUCED HIS CHILDREN IN COURT WHICH WAS A MOVING
SPECTACLE TOGETHER WITH A HOST OF RELATIONS AND FRIENDS WHEREAS I
WHO AM PROBABLY IN DANGER OF MY LIFE WILL DO NONE OF THESE THINGS
THE
CONTRAST MAY OCCUR TO HIS MIND AND HE MAY BE SET AGAINST ME AND VOTE
IN ANGER BECAUSE HE IS DISPLEASED AT ME ON THIS ACCOUNT
NOW IF THERE
BE SUCH A PERSON AMONG YOU MIND I DO NOT SAY THAT THERE IS TO HIM I
MAY FAIRLY REPLY MY FRIEND I AM A MAN AND LIKE OTHER MEN A CREATURE
OF FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT 'OF WOOD OR STONE AS HOMER SAYS AND I
HAVE A FAMILY YES AND SONS O ATHENIANS THREE IN NUMBER ONE ALMOST A
MAN AND TWO OTHERS WHO ARE STILL YOUNG AND YET I WILL NOT BRING ANY OF
THEM HITHER IN ORDER TO PETITION YOU FOR AN ACQUITTAL
AND WHY NOT NOT
FROM ANY SELF ASSERTION OR WANT OF RESPECT FOR YOU
WHETHER I AM OR AM
NOT AFRAID OF DEATH IS ANOTHER QUESTION OF WHICH I WILL NOT NOW SPEAK
BUT HAVING REGARD TO PUBLIC OPINION I FEEL THAT SUCH CONDUCT WOULD BE
DISCREDITABLE TO MYSELF AND TO YOU AND TO THE WHOLE STATE
ONE WHO
HAS REACHED MY YEARS AND WHO HAS A NAME FOR WISDOM OUGHT NOT TO DEMEAN
HIMSELF
WHETHER THIS OPINION OF ME BE DESERVED OR NOT AT ANY RATE THE
WORLD HAS DECIDED THAT SOCRATES IS IN SOME WAY SUPERIOR TO OTHER
MEN
AND IF THOSE AMONG YOU WHO ARE SAID TO BE SUPERIOR IN WISDOM
AND COURAGE AND ANY OTHER VIRTUE DEMEAN THEMSELVES IN THIS WAY HOW
SHAMEFUL IS THEIR CONDUCT I HAVE SEEN MEN OF REPUTATION WHEN THEY HAVE
BEEN CONDEMNED BEHAVING IN THE STRANGEST MANNER THEY SEEMED TO FANCY
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SUFFER SOMETHING DREADFUL IF THEY DIED AND THAT
THEY COULD BE IMMORTAL IF YOU ONLY ALLOWED THEM TO LIVE AND I THINK
THAT SUCH ARE A DISHONOUR TO THE STATE AND THAT ANY STRANGER COMING IN
WOULD HAVE SAID OF THEM THAT THE MOST EMINENT MEN OF ATHENS TO WHOM THE
ATHENIANS THEMSELVES GIVE HONOUR AND COMMAND ARE NO BETTER THAN WOMEN
AND I SAY THAT THESE THINGS OUGHT NOT TO BE DONE BY THOSE OF US WHO HAVE
A REPUTATION AND IF THEY ARE DONE YOU OUGHT NOT TO PERMIT THEM YOU
OUGHT RATHER TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE FAR MORE DISPOSED TO CONDEMN THE MAN
WHO GETS UP A DOLEFUL SCENE AND MAKES THE CITY RIDICULOUS THAN HIM WHO
HOLDS HIS PEACE
BUT SETTING ASIDE THE QUESTION OF PUBLIC OPINION THERE SEEMS TO BE
SOMETHING WRONG IN ASKING A FAVOUR OF A JUDGE AND THUS PROCURING AN
ACQUITTAL INSTEAD OF INFORMING AND CONVINCING HIM
FOR HIS DUTY IS
NOT TO MAKE A PRESENT OF JUSTICE BUT TO GIVE JUDGMENT AND HE HAS SWORN
THAT HE WILL JUDGE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS AND NOT ACCORDING TO HIS OWN
GOOD PLEASURE AND WE OUGHT NOT TO ENCOURAGE YOU NOR SHOULD YOU ALLOW
YOURSELVES TO BE ENCOURAGED IN THIS HABIT OF PERJURY THERE CAN BE
NO PIETY IN THAT
DO NOT THEN REQUIRE ME TO DO WHAT I CONSIDER
DISHONOURABLE AND IMPIOUS AND WRONG ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN I AM BEING
TRIED FOR IMPIETY ON THE INDICTMENT OF MELETUS
FOR IF O MEN OF ATHENS
BY FORCE OF PERSUASION AND ENTREATY I COULD OVERPOWER YOUR OATHS THEN
I SHOULD BE TEACHING YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE NO GODS AND IN
DEFENDING SHOULD SIMPLY CONVICT MYSELF OF THE CHARGE OF NOT BELIEVING IN
THEM
BUT THAT IS NOT SO FAR OTHERWISE
FOR I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE
ARE GODS AND IN A SENSE HIGHER THAN THAT IN WHICH ANY OF MY ACCUSERS
BELIEVE IN THEM
AND TO YOU AND TO GOD I COMMIT MY CAUSE TO BE
DETERMINED BY YOU AS IS BEST FOR YOU AND ME
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY I AM NOT GRIEVED O MEN OF ATHENS AT THE
VOTE OF CONDEMNATION
I EXPECTED IT AND AM ONLY SURPRISED THAT THE
VOTES ARE SO NEARLY EQUAL FOR I HAD THOUGHT THAT THE MAJORITY AGAINST
ME WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR LARGER BUT NOW HAD THIRTY VOTES GONE OVER TO
THE OTHER SIDE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED
AND I MAY SAY I THINK
THAT I HAVE ESCAPED MELETUS
I MAY SAY MORE FOR WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE
OF ANYTUS AND LYCON ANY ONE MAY SEE THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A FIFTH
PART OF THE VOTES AS THE LAW REQUIRES IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD HAVE
INCURRED A FINE OF A THOUSAND DRACHMAE
AND SO HE PROPOSES DEATH AS THE PENALTY
AND WHAT SHALL I PROPOSE ON MY
PART O MEN OF ATHENS CLEARLY THAT WHICH IS MY DUE
AND WHAT IS MY DUE
WHAT RETURN SHALL BE MADE TO THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER HAD THE WIT TO BE
IDLE DURING HIS WHOLE LIFE BUT HAS BEEN CARELESS OF WHAT THE MANY CARE
FOR WEALTH AND FAMILY INTERESTS AND MILITARY OFFICES AND SPEAKING IN
THE ASSEMBLY AND MAGISTRACIES AND PLOTS AND PARTIES
REFLECTING THAT
I WAS REALLY TOO HONEST A MAN TO BE A POLITICIAN AND LIVE I DID NOT GO
WHERE I COULD DO NO GOOD TO YOU OR TO MYSELF BUT WHERE I COULD DO THE
GREATEST GOOD PRIVATELY TO EVERY ONE OF YOU THITHER I WENT AND SOUGHT
TO PERSUADE EVERY MAN AMONG YOU THAT HE MUST LOOK TO HIMSELF AND SEEK
VIRTUE AND WISDOM BEFORE HE LOOKS TO HIS PRIVATE INTERESTS AND LOOK TO
THE STATE BEFORE HE LOOKS TO THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE AND THAT THIS
SHOULD BE THE ORDER WHICH HE OBSERVES IN ALL HIS ACTIONS
WHAT SHALL BE
DONE TO SUCH AN ONE DOUBTLESS SOME GOOD THING O MEN OF ATHENS IF HE
HAS HIS REWARD AND THE GOOD SHOULD BE OF A KIND SUITABLE TO HIM
WHAT
WOULD BE A REWARD SUITABLE TO A POOR MAN WHO IS YOUR BENEFACTOR AND
WHO DESIRES LEISURE THAT HE MAY INSTRUCT YOU THERE CAN BE NO REWARD SO
FITTING AS MAINTENANCE IN THE PRYTANEUM O MEN OF ATHENS A REWARD WHICH
HE DESERVES FAR MORE THAN THE CITIZEN WHO HAS WON THE PRIZE AT OLYMPIA
IN THE HORSE OR CHARIOT RACE WHETHER THE CHARIOTS WERE DRAWN BY TWO
HORSES OR BY MANY
FOR I AM IN WANT AND HE HAS ENOUGH AND HE ONLY
GIVES YOU THE APPEARANCE OF HAPPINESS AND I GIVE YOU THE REALITY
AND
IF I AM TO ESTIMATE THE PENALTY FAIRLY I SHOULD SAY THAT MAINTENANCE IN
THE PRYTANEUM IS THE JUST RETURN
PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT I AM BRAVING YOU IN WHAT I AM SAYING NOW AS IN
WHAT I SAID BEFORE ABOUT THE TEARS AND PRAYERS
BUT THIS IS NOT SO
I
SPEAK RATHER BECAUSE I AM CONVINCED THAT I NEVER INTENTIONALLY WRONGED
ANY ONE ALTHOUGH I CANNOT CONVINCE YOU THE TIME HAS BEEN TOO SHORT IF
THERE WERE A LAW AT ATHENS AS THERE IS IN OTHER CITIES THAT A CAPITAL
CAUSE SHOULD NOT BE DECIDED IN ONE DAY THEN I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD
HAVE CONVINCED YOU
BUT I CANNOT IN A MOMENT REFUTE GREAT SLANDERS AND
AS I AM CONVINCED THAT I NEVER WRONGED ANOTHER I WILL ASSUREDLY NOT
WRONG MYSELF
I WILL NOT SAY OF MYSELF THAT I DESERVE ANY EVIL OR
PROPOSE ANY PENALTY
WHY SHOULD I BECAUSE I AM AFRAID OF THE PENALTY OF
DEATH WHICH MELETUS PROPOSES WHEN I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER DEATH IS A GOOD
OR AN EVIL WHY SHOULD I PROPOSE A PENALTY WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN
EVIL SHALL I SAY IMPRISONMENT AND WHY SHOULD I LIVE IN PRISON AND BE
THE SLAVE OF THE MAGISTRATES OF THE YEAR OF THE ELEVEN OR SHALL THE
PENALTY BE A FINE AND IMPRISONMENT UNTIL THE FINE IS PAID THERE IS THE
SAME OBJECTION
I SHOULD HAVE TO LIE IN PRISON FOR MONEY I HAVE NONE
AND CANNOT PAY
AND IF I SAY EXILE AND THIS MAY POSSIBLY BE THE PENALTY
WHICH YOU WILL AFFIX I MUST INDEED BE BLINDED BY THE LOVE OF LIFE IF
I AM SO IRRATIONAL AS TO EXPECT THAT WHEN YOU WHO ARE MY OWN CITIZENS
CANNOT ENDURE MY DISCOURSES AND WORDS AND HAVE FOUND THEM SO GRIEVOUS
AND ODIOUS THAT YOU WILL HAVE NO MORE OF THEM OTHERS ARE LIKELY TO
ENDURE ME
NO INDEED MEN OF ATHENS THAT IS NOT VERY LIKELY
AND WHAT
A LIFE SHOULD I LEAD AT MY AGE WANDERING FROM CITY TO CITY EVER
CHANGING MY PLACE OF EXILE AND ALWAYS BEING DRIVEN OUT FOR I AM QUITE
SURE THAT WHEREVER I GO THERE AS HERE THE YOUNG MEN WILL FLOCK TO
ME AND IF I DRIVE THEM AWAY THEIR ELDERS WILL DRIVE ME OUT AT THEIR
REQUEST AND IF I LET THEM COME THEIR FATHERS AND FRIENDS WILL DRIVE ME
OUT FOR THEIR SAKES
SOME ONE WILL SAY YES SOCRATES BUT CANNOT YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND
THEN YOU MAY GO INTO A FOREIGN CITY AND NO ONE WILL INTERFERE WITH YOU
NOW I HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN MAKING YOU UNDERSTAND MY ANSWER TO THIS
FOR IF I TELL YOU THAT TO DO AS YOU SAY WOULD BE A DISOBEDIENCE TO THE
GOD AND THEREFORE THAT I CANNOT HOLD MY TONGUE YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
THAT I AM SERIOUS AND IF I SAY AGAIN THAT DAILY TO DISCOURSE ABOUT
VIRTUE AND OF THOSE OTHER THINGS ABOUT WHICH YOU HEAR ME EXAMINING
MYSELF AND OTHERS IS THE GREATEST GOOD OF MAN AND THAT THE UNEXAMINED
LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING YOU ARE STILL LESS LIKELY TO BELIEVE ME
YET
I SAY WHAT IS TRUE ALTHOUGH A THING OF WHICH IT IS HARD FOR ME TO
PERSUADE YOU
ALSO I HAVE NEVER BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THINK THAT I DESERVE
TO SUFFER ANY HARM
HAD I MONEY I MIGHT HAVE ESTIMATED THE OFFENCE AT
WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH THE WORSE
BUT I HAVE
NONE AND THEREFORE I MUST ASK YOU TO PROPORTION THE FINE TO MY MEANS
WELL PERHAPS I COULD AFFORD A MINA AND THEREFORE I PROPOSE THAT
PENALTY PLATO CRITO CRITOBULUS AND APOLLODORUS MY FRIENDS HERE BID
ME SAY THIRTY MINAE AND THEY WILL BE THE SURETIES
LET THIRTY MINAE BE
THE PENALTY FOR WHICH SUM THEY WILL BE AMPLE SECURITY TO YOU
NOT MUCH TIME WILL BE GAINED O ATHENIANS IN RETURN FOR THE EVIL NAME
WHICH YOU WILL GET FROM THE DETRACTORS OF THE CITY WHO WILL SAY THAT
YOU KILLED SOCRATES A WISE MAN FOR THEY WILL CALL ME WISE EVEN
ALTHOUGH I AM NOT WISE WHEN THEY WANT TO REPROACH YOU
IF YOU HAD
WAITED A LITTLE WHILE YOUR DESIRE WOULD HAVE BEEN FULFILLED IN THE
COURSE OF NATURE
FOR I AM FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AS YOU MAY PERCEIVE
AND NOT FAR FROM DEATH
I AM SPEAKING NOW NOT TO ALL OF YOU BUT ONLY TO
THOSE WHO HAVE CONDEMNED ME TO DEATH
AND I HAVE ANOTHER THING TO SAY TO
THEM YOU THINK THAT I WAS CONVICTED BECAUSE I HAD NO WORDS OF THE SORT
WHICH WOULD HAVE PROCURED MY ACQUITTAL I MEAN IF I HAD THOUGHT FIT TO
LEAVE NOTHING UNDONE OR UNSAID
NOT SO THE DEFICIENCY WHICH LED TO MY
CONVICTION WAS NOT OF WORDS CERTAINLY NOT
BUT I HAD NOT THE BOLDNESS
OR IMPUDENCE OR INCLINATION TO ADDRESS YOU AS YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED ME TO
DO WEEPING AND WAILING AND LAMENTING AND SAYING AND DOING MANY THINGS
WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HEAR FROM OTHERS AND WHICH AS I
MAINTAIN ARE UNWORTHY OF ME
I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT I OUGHT NOT TO
DO ANYTHING COMMON OR MEAN WHEN IN DANGER NOR DO I NOW REPENT OF THE
STYLE OF MY DEFENCE I WOULD RATHER DIE HAVING SPOKEN AFTER MY MANNER
THAN SPEAK IN YOUR MANNER AND LIVE
FOR NEITHER IN WAR NOR YET AT LAW
OUGHT I OR ANY MAN TO USE EVERY WAY OF ESCAPING DEATH
OFTEN IN BATTLE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IF A MAN WILL THROW AWAY HIS ARMS AND FALL
ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIS PURSUERS HE MAY ESCAPE DEATH AND IN OTHER
DANGERS THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF ESCAPING DEATH IF A MAN IS WILLING TO
SAY AND DO ANYTHING
THE DIFFICULTY MY FRIENDS IS NOT TO AVOID DEATH
BUT TO AVOID UNRIGHTEOUSNESS FOR THAT RUNS FASTER THAN DEATH
I AM OLD
AND MOVE SLOWLY AND THE SLOWER RUNNER HAS OVERTAKEN ME AND MY ACCUSERS
ARE KEEN AND QUICK AND THE FASTER RUNNER WHO IS UNRIGHTEOUSNESS HAS
OVERTAKEN THEM
AND NOW I DEPART HENCE CONDEMNED BY YOU TO SUFFER THE
PENALTY OF DEATH THEY TOO GO THEIR WAYS CONDEMNED BY THE TRUTH
TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF VILLAINY AND WRONG AND I MUST ABIDE BY MY
AWARD LET THEM ABIDE BY THEIRS
I SUPPOSE THAT THESE THINGS MAY BE
REGARDED AS FATED AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE WELL
AND NOW O MEN WHO HAVE CONDEMNED ME I WOULD FAIN PROPHESY TO YOU
FOR I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND IN THE HOUR OF DEATH MEN ARE GIFTED WITH
PROPHETIC POWER
AND I PROPHESY TO YOU WHO ARE MY MURDERERS THAT
IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY DEPARTURE PUNISHMENT FAR HEAVIER THAN YOU HAVE
INFLICTED ON ME WILL SURELY AWAIT YOU
ME YOU HAVE KILLED BECAUSE YOU
WANTED TO ESCAPE THE ACCUSER AND NOT TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR LIVES
BUT THAT WILL NOT BE AS YOU SUPPOSE FAR OTHERWISE
FOR I SAY THAT THERE
WILL BE MORE ACCUSERS OF YOU THAN THERE ARE NOW ACCUSERS WHOM
HITHERTO I HAVE RESTRAINED AND AS THEY ARE YOUNGER THEY WILL BE MORE
INCONSIDERATE WITH YOU AND YOU WILL BE MORE OFFENDED AT THEM
IF YOU
THINK THAT BY KILLING MEN YOU CAN PREVENT SOME ONE FROM CENSURING YOUR
EVIL LIVES YOU ARE MISTAKEN THAT IS NOT A WAY OF ESCAPE WHICH IS
EITHER POSSIBLE OR HONOURABLE THE EASIEST AND THE NOBLEST WAY IS NOT
TO BE DISABLING OTHERS BUT TO BE IMPROVING YOURSELVES
THIS IS THE
PROPHECY WHICH I UTTER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE TO THE JUDGES WHO HAVE
CONDEMNED ME
FRIENDS WHO WOULD HAVE ACQUITTED ME I WOULD LIKE ALSO TO TALK WITH YOU
ABOUT THE THING WHICH HAS COME TO PASS WHILE THE MAGISTRATES ARE BUSY
AND BEFORE I GO TO THE PLACE AT WHICH I MUST DIE
STAY THEN A LITTLE
FOR WE MAY AS WELL TALK WITH ONE ANOTHER WHILE THERE IS TIME
YOU ARE MY
FRIENDS AND I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE MEANING OF THIS EVENT WHICH
HAS HAPPENED TO ME
O MY JUDGES FOR YOU I MAY TRULY CALL JUDGES I
SHOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU OF A WONDERFUL CIRCUMSTANCE
HITHERTO THE DIVINE
FACULTY OF WHICH THE INTERNAL ORACLE IS THE SOURCE HAS CONSTANTLY BEEN
IN THE HABIT OF OPPOSING ME EVEN ABOUT TRIFLES IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE
A SLIP OR ERROR IN ANY MATTER AND NOW AS YOU SEE THERE HAS COME UPON ME
THAT WHICH MAY BE THOUGHT AND IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO BE THE LAST AND
WORST EVIL
BUT THE ORACLE MADE NO SIGN OF OPPOSITION EITHER WHEN I WAS
LEAVING MY HOUSE IN THE MORNING OR WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE COURT
OR WHILE I WAS SPEAKING AT ANYTHING WHICH I WAS GOING TO SAY AND YET I
HAVE OFTEN BEEN STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A SPEECH BUT NOW IN NOTHING
I EITHER SAID OR DID TOUCHING THE MATTER IN HAND HAS THE ORACLE OPPOSED
ME
WHAT DO I TAKE TO BE THE EXPLANATION OF THIS SILENCE I WILL TELL
YOU
IT IS AN INTIMATION THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME IS A GOOD AND
THAT THOSE OF US WHO THINK THAT DEATH IS AN EVIL ARE IN ERROR
FOR THE
CUSTOMARY SIGN WOULD SURELY HAVE OPPOSED ME HAD I BEEN GOING TO EVIL AND
NOT TO GOOD
LET US REFLECT IN ANOTHER WAY AND WE SHALL SEE THAT THERE IS GREAT
REASON TO HOPE THAT DEATH IS A GOOD FOR ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER DEATH
IS A STATE OF NOTHINGNESS AND UTTER UNCONSCIOUSNESS OR AS MEN SAY
THERE IS A CHANGE AND MIGRATION OF THE SOUL FROM THIS WORLD TO ANOTHER
NOW IF YOU SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS NO CONSCIOUSNESS BUT A SLEEP LIKE
THE SLEEP OF HIM WHO IS UNDISTURBED EVEN BY DREAMS DEATH WILL BE AN
UNSPEAKABLE GAIN
FOR IF A PERSON WERE TO SELECT THE NIGHT IN WHICH HIS
SLEEP WAS UNDISTURBED EVEN BY DREAMS AND WERE TO COMPARE WITH THIS THE
OTHER DAYS AND NIGHTS OF HIS LIFE AND THEN WERE TO TELL US HOW MANY
DAYS AND NIGHTS HE HAD PASSED IN THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE BETTER AND MORE
PLEASANTLY THAN THIS ONE I THINK THAT ANY MAN I WILL NOT SAY A PRIVATE
MAN BUT EVEN THE GREAT KING WILL NOT FIND MANY SUCH DAYS OR NIGHTS
WHEN COMPARED WITH THE OTHERS
NOW IF DEATH BE OF SUCH A NATURE I SAY
THAT TO DIE IS GAIN FOR ETERNITY IS THEN ONLY A SINGLE NIGHT
BUT IF
DEATH IS THE JOURNEY TO ANOTHER PLACE AND THERE AS MEN SAY ALL THE
DEAD ABIDE WHAT GOOD O MY FRIENDS AND JUDGES CAN BE GREATER THAN
THIS IF INDEED WHEN THE PILGRIM ARRIVES IN THE WORLD BELOW HE IS
DELIVERED FROM THE PROFESSORS OF JUSTICE IN THIS WORLD AND FINDS THE
TRUE JUDGES WHO ARE SAID TO GIVE JUDGMENT THERE MINOS AND RHADAMANTHUS
AND AEACUS AND TRIPTOLEMUS AND OTHER SONS OF GOD WHO WERE RIGHTEOUS IN
THEIR OWN LIFE THAT PILGRIMAGE WILL BE WORTH MAKING
WHAT WOULD NOT A
MAN GIVE IF HE MIGHT CONVERSE WITH ORPHEUS AND MUSAEUS AND HESIOD AND
HOMER NAY IF THIS BE TRUE LET ME DIE AGAIN AND AGAIN
I MYSELF TOO
SHALL HAVE A WONDERFUL INTEREST IN THERE MEETING AND CONVERSING WITH
PALAMEDES AND AJAX THE SON OF TELAMON AND ANY OTHER ANCIENT HERO WHO
HAS SUFFERED DEATH THROUGH AN UNJUST JUDGMENT AND THERE WILL BE NO
SMALL PLEASURE AS I THINK IN COMPARING MY OWN SUFFERINGS WITH THEIRS
ABOVE ALL I SHALL THEN BE ABLE TO CONTINUE MY SEARCH INTO TRUE AND
FALSE KNOWLEDGE AS IN THIS WORLD SO ALSO IN THE NEXT AND I SHALL FIND
OUT WHO IS WISE AND WHO PRETENDS TO BE WISE AND IS NOT
WHAT WOULD
NOT A MAN GIVE O JUDGES TO BE ABLE TO EXAMINE THE LEADER OF THE GREAT
TROJAN EXPEDITION OR ODYSSEUS OR SISYPHUS OR NUMBERLESS OTHERS MEN
AND WOMEN TOO WHAT INFINITE DELIGHT WOULD THERE BE IN CONVERSING WITH
THEM AND ASKING THEM QUESTIONS IN ANOTHER WORLD THEY DO NOT PUT A MAN
TO DEATH FOR ASKING QUESTIONS ASSUREDLY NOT
FOR BESIDES BEING HAPPIER
THAN WE ARE THEY WILL BE IMMORTAL IF WHAT IS SAID IS TRUE
WHEREFORE O JUDGES BE OF GOOD CHEER ABOUT DEATH AND KNOW OF A
CERTAINTY THAT NO EVIL CAN HAPPEN TO A GOOD MAN EITHER IN LIFE OR
AFTER DEATH
HE AND HIS ARE NOT NEGLECTED BY THE GODS NOR HAS MY OWN
APPROACHING END HAPPENED BY MERE CHANCE
BUT I SEE CLEARLY THAT THE
TIME HAD ARRIVED WHEN IT WAS BETTER FOR ME TO DIE AND BE RELEASED FROM
TROUBLE WHEREFORE THE ORACLE GAVE NO SIGN
FOR WHICH REASON ALSO I AM
NOT ANGRY WITH MY CONDEMNERS OR WITH MY ACCUSERS THEY HAVE DONE ME NO
HARM ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT MEAN TO DO ME ANY GOOD AND FOR THIS I MAY
GENTLY BLAME THEM
STILL I HAVE A FAVOUR TO ASK OF THEM
WHEN MY SONS ARE GROWN UP I WOULD
ASK YOU O MY FRIENDS TO PUNISH THEM AND I WOULD HAVE YOU TROUBLE
THEM AS I HAVE TROUBLED YOU IF THEY SEEM TO CARE ABOUT RICHES OR
ANYTHING MORE THAN ABOUT VIRTUE OR IF THEY PRETEND TO BE SOMETHING
WHEN THEY ARE REALLY NOTHING THEN REPROVE THEM AS I HAVE REPROVED
YOU FOR NOT CARING ABOUT THAT FOR WHICH THEY OUGHT TO CARE AND
THINKING THAT THEY ARE SOMETHING WHEN THEY ARE REALLY NOTHING
AND
IF YOU DO THIS BOTH I AND MY SONS WILL HAVE RECEIVED JUSTICE AT YOUR
HANDS
THE HOUR OF DEPARTURE HAS ARRIVED AND WE GO OUR WAYS I TO DIE AND YOU
TO LIVE
WHICH IS BETTER GOD ONLY KNOWS

TRANSLATED BY BENJAMIN JOWETT
INTRODUCTION
AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SOME MONTHS OR YEARS AND AT PHLIUS A TOWN OF
PELOPONNESUS THE TALE OF THE LAST HOURS OF SOCRATES IS NARRATED TO
ECHECRATES AND OTHER PHLIASIANS BY PHAEDO THE 'BELOVED DISCIPLE THE
DIALOGUE NECESSARILY TAKES THE FORM OF A NARRATIVE BECAUSE SOCRATES HAS
TO BE DESCRIBED ACTING AS WELL AS SPEAKING
THE MINUTEST PARTICULARS OF
THE EVENT ARE INTERESTING TO DISTANT FRIENDS AND THE NARRATOR HAS AN
EQUAL INTEREST IN THEM
DURING THE VOYAGE OF THE SACRED SHIP TO AND FROM DELOS WHICH HAS
OCCUPIED THIRTY DAYS THE EXECUTION OF SOCRATES HAS BEEN DEFERRED
COMPARE XEN
MEM THE TIME HAS BEEN PASSED BY HIM IN CONVERSATION WITH
A SELECT COMPANY OF DISCIPLES
BUT NOW THE HOLY SEASON IS OVER AND THE
DISCIPLES MEET EARLIER THAN USUAL IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY CONVERSE WITH
SOCRATES FOR THE LAST TIME
THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT AND THOSE WHO MIGHT
HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO BE PRESENT ARE MENTIONED BY NAME
THERE ARE
SIMMIAS AND CEBES CRITO TWO DISCIPLES OF PHILOLAUS WHOM SOCRATES
'BY HIS ENCHANTMENTS HAS ATTRACTED FROM THEBES' MEM CRITO THE AGED
FRIEND THE ATTENDANT OF THE PRISON WHO IS AS GOOD AS A FRIEND THESE
TAKE PART IN THE CONVERSATION
THERE ARE PRESENT ALSO HERMOGENES
FROM WHOM XENOPHON DERIVED HIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRIAL OF SOCRATES
MEM THE 'MADMAN' APOLLODORUS SYMP EUCLID AND TERPSION FROM
MEGARA COMPARE THEAET CTESIPPUS ANTISTHENES MENEXENUS AND SOME
OTHER LESS KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE SOCRATIC CIRCLE ALL OF WHOM ARE SILENT
AUDITORS
ARISTIPPUS CLEOMBROTUS AND PLATO ARE NOTED AS ABSENT
ALMOST
AS SOON AS THE FRIENDS OF SOCRATES ENTER THE PRISON XANTHIPPE AND HER
CHILDREN ARE SENT HOME IN THE CARE OF ONE OF CRITO'S SERVANTS
SOCRATES HIMSELF HAS JUST BEEN RELEASED FROM CHAINS AND IS LED BY THIS
CIRCUMSTANCE TO MAKE THE NATURAL REMARK THAT 'PLEASURE FOLLOWS PAIN
OBSERVE THAT PLATO IS PREPARING THE WAY FOR HIS DOCTRINE OF THE
ALTERNATION OF OPPOSITES 'AESOP WOULD HAVE REPRESENTED THEM IN A FABLE
AS A TWO HEADED CREATURE OF THE GODS THE MENTION OF AESOP REMINDS
CEBES OF A QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED BY EVENUS THE POET COMPARE
APOL 'WHY SOCRATES WHO WAS NOT A POET WHILE IN PRISON HAD BEEN
PUTTING AESOP INTO VERSE 'BECAUSE SEVERAL TIMES IN HIS LIFE HE HAD
BEEN WARNED IN DREAMS THAT HE SHOULD PRACTISE MUSIC AND AS HE WAS ABOUT
TO DIE AND WAS NOT CERTAIN OF WHAT WAS MEANT HE WISHED TO FULFIL THE
ADMONITION IN THE LETTER AS WELL AS IN THE SPIRIT BY WRITING VERSES AS
WELL AS BY CULTIVATING PHILOSOPHY
TELL THIS TO EVENUS AND SAY THAT I
WOULD HAVE HIM FOLLOW ME IN DEATH 'HE IS NOT AT ALL THE SORT OF MAN
TO COMPLY WITH YOUR REQUEST SOCRATES 'WHY IS HE NOT A PHILOSOPHER
'YES 'THEN HE WILL BE WILLING TO DIE ALTHOUGH HE WILL NOT TAKE HIS
OWN LIFE FOR THAT IS HELD TO BE UNLAWFUL
CEBES ASKS WHY SUICIDE IS THOUGHT NOT TO BE RIGHT IF DEATH IS TO BE
ACCOUNTED A GOOD WELL 1 ACCORDING TO ONE EXPLANATION BECAUSE MAN IS
A PRISONER WHO MUST NOT OPEN THE DOOR OF HIS PRISON AND RUN AWAY THIS
IS THE TRUTH IN A 'MYSTERY OR 2 RATHER BECAUSE HE IS NOT HIS OWN
PROPERTY BUT A POSSESSION OF THE GODS AND HAS NO RIGHT TO MAKE AWAY
WITH THAT WHICH DOES NOT BELONG TO HIM
BUT WHY ASKS CEBES IF HE IS A
POSSESSION OF THE GODS SHOULD HE WISH TO DIE AND LEAVE THEM FOR HE IS
UNDER THEIR PROTECTION AND SURELY HE CANNOT TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIMSELF
THAN THEY TAKE OF HIM
SIMMIAS EXPLAINS THAT CEBES IS REALLY REFERRING
TO SOCRATES WHOM THEY THINK TOO UNMOVED AT THE PROSPECT OF LEAVING THE
GODS AND HIS FRIENDS
SOCRATES ANSWERS THAT HE IS GOING TO OTHER GODS
WHO ARE WISE AND GOOD AND PERHAPS TO BETTER FRIENDS AND HE PROFESSES
THAT HE IS READY TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THE CHARGE OF CEBES
THE COMPANY SHALL BE HIS JUDGES AND HE HOPES THAT HE WILL BE MORE
SUCCESSFUL IN CONVINCING THEM THAN HE HAD BEEN IN CONVINCING THE COURT
THE PHILOSOPHER DESIRES DEATH WHICH THE WICKED WORLD WILL INSINUATE
THAT HE ALSO DESERVES AND PERHAPS HE DOES BUT NOT IN ANY SENSE WHICH
THEY ARE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING
ENOUGH OF THEM THE REAL QUESTION
IS WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT DEATH WHICH HE DESIRES DEATH IS
THE SEPARATION OF SOUL AND BODY AND THE PHILOSOPHER DESIRES SUCH
A SEPARATION
HE WOULD LIKE TO BE FREED FROM THE DOMINION OF BODILY
PLEASURES AND OF THE SENSES WHICH ARE ALWAYS PERTURBING HIS MENTAL
VISION
HE WANTS TO GET RID OF EYES AND EARS AND WITH THE LIGHT OF THE
MIND ONLY TO BEHOLD THE LIGHT OF TRUTH
ALL THE EVILS AND IMPURITIES
AND NECESSITIES OF MEN COME FROM THE BODY
AND DEATH SEPARATES HIM FROM
THESE CORRUPTIONS WHICH IN LIFE HE CANNOT WHOLLY LAY ASIDE
WHY THEN
SHOULD HE REPINE WHEN THE HOUR OF SEPARATION ARRIVES WHY IF HE IS DEAD
WHILE HE LIVES SHOULD HE FEAR THAT OTHER DEATH THROUGH WHICH ALONE HE
CAN BEHOLD WISDOM IN HER PURITY
BESIDES THE PHILOSOPHER HAS NOTIONS OF GOOD AND EVIL UNLIKE THOSE OF
OTHER MEN
FOR THEY ARE COURAGEOUS BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF GREATER
DANGERS AND TEMPERATE BECAUSE THEY DESIRE GREATER PLEASURES
BUT HE
DISDAINS THIS BALANCING OF PLEASURES AND PAINS WHICH IS THE EXCHANGE
OF COMMERCE AND NOT OF VIRTUE
ALL THE VIRTUES INCLUDING WISDOM ARE
REGARDED BY HIM ONLY AS PURIFICATIONS OF THE SOUL
AND THIS WAS THE
MEANING OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE MYSTERIES WHEN THEY SAID 'MANY ARE THE
WAND BEARERS BUT FEW ARE THE MYSTICS COMPARE MATT
XXII 'MANY ARE
CALLED BUT FEW ARE CHOSEN AND IN THE HOPE THAT HE IS ONE OF THESE
MYSTICS SOCRATES IS NOW DEPARTING
THIS IS HIS ANSWER TO ANY ONE WHO
CHARGES HIM WITH INDIFFERENCE AT THE PROSPECT OF LEAVING THE GODS AND
HIS FRIENDS
STILL A FEAR IS EXPRESSED THAT THE SOUL UPON LEAVING THE BODY MAY
VANISH AWAY LIKE SMOKE OR AIR
SOCRATES IN ANSWER APPEALS FIRST OF ALL
TO THE OLD ORPHIC TRADITION THAT THE SOULS OF THE DEAD ARE IN THE WORLD
BELOW AND THAT THE LIVING COME FROM THEM
THIS HE ATTEMPTS TO FOUND
ON A PHILOSOPHICAL ASSUMPTION THAT ALL OPPOSITES E G
LESS GREATER
WEAKER STRONGER SLEEPING WAKING LIFE DEATH ARE GENERATED OUT OF
EACH OTHER
NOR CAN THE PROCESS OF GENERATION BE ONLY A PASSAGE FROM
LIVING TO DYING FOR THEN ALL WOULD END IN DEATH
THE PERPETUAL SLEEPER
ENDYMION WOULD BE NO LONGER DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST OF MANKIND
THE CIRCLE OF NATURE IS NOT COMPLETE UNLESS THE LIVING COME FROM THE
DEAD AS WELL AS PASS TO THEM
THE PLATONIC DOCTRINE OF REMINISCENCE IS THEN ADDUCED AS A CONFIRMATION
OF THE PRE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL
SOME PROOFS OF THIS DOCTRINE ARE
DEMANDED
ONE PROOF GIVEN IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE MENO AND IS
DERIVED FROM THE LATENT KNOWLEDGE OF MATHEMATICS WHICH MAY BE ELICITED
FROM AN UNLEARNED PERSON WHEN A DIAGRAM IS PRESENTED TO HIM
AGAIN
THERE IS A POWER OF ASSOCIATION WHICH FROM SEEING SIMMIAS MAY REMEMBER
CEBES OR FROM SEEING A PICTURE OF SIMMIAS MAY REMEMBER SIMMIAS
THE
LYRE MAY RECALL THE PLAYER OF THE LYRE AND EQUAL PIECES OF WOOD OR
STONE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGHER NOTION OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY
BUT
HERE OBSERVE THAT MATERIAL EQUALITIES FALL SHORT OF THE CONCEPTION OF
ABSOLUTE EQUALITY WITH WHICH THEY ARE COMPARED AND WHICH IS THE MEASURE
OF THEM
AND THE MEASURE OR STANDARD MUST BE PRIOR TO THAT WHICH IS
MEASURED THE IDEA OF EQUALITY PRIOR TO THE VISIBLE EQUALS
AND IF PRIOR
TO THEM THEN PRIOR ALSO TO THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE SENSES WHICH RECALL
THEM AND THEREFORE EITHER GIVEN BEFORE BIRTH OR AT BIRTH
BUT ALL MEN
HAVE NOT THIS KNOWLEDGE NOR HAVE ANY WITHOUT A PROCESS OF REMINISCENCE
WHICH IS A PROOF THAT IT IS NOT INNATE OR GIVEN AT BIRTH UNLESS INDEED
IT WAS GIVEN AND TAKEN AWAY AT THE SAME INSTANT
BUT IF NOT GIVEN TO
MEN IN BIRTH IT MUST HAVE BEEN GIVEN BEFORE BIRTH THIS IS THE ONLY
ALTERNATIVE WHICH REMAINS
AND IF WE HAD IDEAS IN A FORMER STATE THEN
OUR SOULS MUST HAVE EXISTED AND MUST HAVE HAD INTELLIGENCE IN A FORMER
STATE
THE PRE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL STANDS OR FALLS WITH THE DOCTRINE
OF IDEAS
IT IS OBJECTED BY SIMMIAS AND CEBES THAT THESE ARGUMENTS ONLY PROVE A
FORMER AND NOT A FUTURE EXISTENCE
SOCRATES ANSWERS THIS OBJECTION BY
RECALLING THE PREVIOUS ARGUMENT IN WHICH HE HAD SHOWN THAT THE LIVING
COME FROM THE DEAD
BUT THE FEAR THAT THE SOUL AT DEPARTING MAY VANISH
INTO AIR ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS A WIND BLOWING AT THE TIME HAS NOT YET
BEEN CHARMED AWAY
HE PROCEEDS WHEN WE FEAR THAT THE SOUL WILL VANISH
AWAY LET US ASK OURSELVES WHAT IS THAT WHICH WE SUPPOSE TO BE LIABLE
TO DISSOLUTION IS IT THE SIMPLE OR THE COMPOUND THE UNCHANGING OR THE
CHANGING THE INVISIBLE IDEA OR THE VISIBLE OBJECT OF SENSE CLEARLY THE
LATTER AND NOT THE FORMER AND THEREFORE NOT THE SOUL WHICH IN HER OWN
PURE THOUGHT IS UNCHANGEABLE AND ONLY WHEN USING THE SENSES DESCENDS
INTO THE REGION OF CHANGE
AGAIN THE SOUL COMMANDS THE BODY SERVES
IN THIS RESPECT TOO THE SOUL IS AKIN TO THE DIVINE AND THE BODY TO THE
MORTAL
AND IN EVERY POINT OF VIEW THE SOUL IS THE IMAGE OF DIVINITY AND
IMMORTALITY AND THE BODY OF THE HUMAN AND MORTAL
AND WHEREAS THE
BODY IS LIABLE TO SPEEDY DISSOLUTION THE SOUL IS ALMOST IF NOT QUITE
INDISSOLUBLE
COMPARE TIM YET EVEN THE BODY MAY BE PRESERVED FOR AGES
BY THE EMBALMER'S ART HOW UNLIKELY THEN THAT THE SOUL WILL PERISH AND
BE DISSIPATED INTO AIR WHILE ON HER WAY TO THE GOOD AND WISE GOD
SHE HAS BEEN GATHERED INTO HERSELF HOLDING ALOOF FROM THE BODY AND
PRACTISING DEATH ALL HER LIFE LONG AND SHE IS NOW FINALLY RELEASED FROM
THE ERRORS AND FOLLIES AND PASSIONS OF MEN AND FOR EVER DWELLS IN THE
COMPANY OF THE GODS
BUT THE SOUL WHICH IS POLLUTED AND ENGROSSED BY THE CORPOREAL AND HAS
NO EYE EXCEPT THAT OF THE SENSES AND IS WEIGHED DOWN BY THE BODILY
APPETITES CANNOT ATTAIN TO THIS ABSTRACTION
IN HER FEAR OF THE WORLD
BELOW SHE LINGERS ABOUT THE SEPULCHRE LOATH TO LEAVE THE BODY WHICH
SHE LOVED A GHOSTLY APPARITION SATURATED WITH SENSE AND THEREFORE
VISIBLE
AT LENGTH ENTERING INTO SOME ANIMAL OF A NATURE CONGENIAL TO
HER FORMER LIFE OF SENSUALITY OR VIOLENCE SHE TAKES THE FORM OF AN ASS
A WOLF OR A KITE
AND OF THESE EARTHLY SOULS THE HAPPIEST ARE THOSE WHO
HAVE PRACTISED VIRTUE WITHOUT PHILOSOPHY THEY ARE ALLOWED TO PASS INTO
GENTLE AND SOCIAL NATURES SUCH AS BEES AND ANTS
COMPARE REPUBLIC
MENO BUT ONLY THE PHILOSOPHER WHO DEPARTS PURE IS PERMITTED TO ENTER
THE COMPANY OF THE GODS
COMPARE PHAEDRUS THIS IS THE REASON WHY HE
ABSTAINS FROM FLESHLY LUSTS AND NOT BECAUSE HE FEARS LOSS OR DISGRACE
WHICH IS THE MOTIVE OF OTHER MEN
HE TOO HAS BEEN A CAPTIVE AND THE
WILLING AGENT OF HIS OWN CAPTIVITY
BUT PHILOSOPHY HAS SPOKEN TO HIM
AND HE HAS HEARD HER VOICE SHE HAS GENTLY ENTREATED HIM AND BROUGHT
HIM OUT OF THE 'MIRY CLAY AND PURGED AWAY THE MISTS OF PASSION AND
THE ILLUSIONS OF SENSE WHICH ENVELOPE HIM HIS SOUL HAS ESCAPED FROM THE
INFLUENCE OF PLEASURES AND PAINS WHICH ARE LIKE NAILS FASTENING HER TO
THE BODY
TO THAT PRISON HOUSE SHE WILL NOT RETURN AND THEREFORE SHE
ABSTAINS FROM BODILY PLEASURES NOT FROM A DESIRE OF HAVING MORE OR
GREATER ONES BUT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT ONLY WHEN CALM AND FREE FROM
THE DOMINION OF THE BODY CAN SHE BEHOLD THE LIGHT OF TRUTH
SIMMIAS AND CEBES REMAIN IN DOUBT BUT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO RAISE
OBJECTIONS AT SUCH A TIME
SOCRATES WONDERS AT THEIR RELUCTANCE
LET
THEM REGARD HIM RATHER AS THE SWAN WHO HAVING SUNG THE PRAISES OF
APOLLO ALL HIS LIFE LONG SINGS AT HIS DEATH MORE LUSTILY THAN EVER
SIMMIAS ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE IS COWARDICE IN NOT PROBING TRUTH TO THE
BOTTOM
'AND IF TRUTH DIVINE AND INSPIRED IS NOT TO BE HAD THEN LET
A MAN TAKE THE BEST OF HUMAN NOTIONS AND UPON THIS FRAIL BARK LET HIM
SAIL THROUGH LIFE HE PROCEEDS TO STATE HIS DIFFICULTY IT HAS BEEN
ARGUED THAT THE SOUL IS INVISIBLE AND INCORPOREAL AND THEREFORE
IMMORTAL AND PRIOR TO THE BODY
BUT IS NOT THE SOUL ACKNOWLEDGED TO
BE A HARMONY AND HAS SHE NOT THE SAME RELATION TO THE BODY AS THE
HARMONY WHICH LIKE HER IS INVISIBLE HAS TO THE LYRE AND YET THE
HARMONY DOES NOT SURVIVE THE LYRE
CEBES HAS ALSO AN OBJECTION WHICH
LIKE SIMMIAS HE EXPRESSES IN A FIGURE
HE IS WILLING TO ADMIT THAT THE
SOUL IS MORE LASTING THAN THE BODY
BUT THE MORE LASTING NATURE OF THE
SOUL DOES NOT PROVE HER IMMORTALITY FOR AFTER HAVING WORN OUT MANY
BODIES IN A SINGLE LIFE AND MANY MORE IN SUCCESSIVE BIRTHS AND
DEATHS SHE MAY AT LAST PERISH OR AS SOCRATES AFTERWARDS RESTATES THE
OBJECTION THE VERY ACT OF BIRTH MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF HER DEATH AND
HER LAST BODY MAY SURVIVE HER JUST AS THE COAT OF AN OLD WEAVER IS LEFT
BEHIND HIM AFTER HE IS DEAD ALTHOUGH A MAN IS MORE LASTING THAN HIS
COAT
AND HE WHO WOULD PROVE THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL MUST PROVE NOT
ONLY THAT THE SOUL OUTLIVES ONE OR MANY BODIES BUT THAT SHE OUTLIVES
THEM ALL
THE AUDIENCE LIKE THE CHORUS IN A PLAY FOR A MOMENT INTERPRET THE
FEELINGS OF THE ACTORS THERE IS A TEMPORARY DEPRESSION AND THEN THE
ENQUIRY IS RESUMED
IT IS A MELANCHOLY REFLECTION THAT ARGUMENTS LIKE
MEN ARE APT TO BE DECEIVERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OFTEN DECEIVED
BECOME DISTRUSTFUL BOTH OF ARGUMENTS AND OF FRIENDS
BUT THIS
UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE SHOULD NOT MAKE US EITHER HATERS OF MEN OR HATERS
OF ARGUMENTS
THE WANT OF HEALTH AND TRUTH IS NOT IN THE ARGUMENT BUT
IN OURSELVES
SOCRATES WHO IS ABOUT TO DIE IS SENSIBLE OF HIS OWN
WEAKNESS HE DESIRES TO BE IMPARTIAL BUT HE CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT HE
HAS TOO GREAT AN INTEREST IN THE TRUTH OF THE ARGUMENT
AND THEREFORE HE
WOULD HAVE HIS FRIENDS EXAMINE AND REFUTE HIM IF THEY THINK THAT HE IS
IN ERROR
AT HIS REQUEST SIMMIAS AND CEBES REPEAT THEIR OBJECTIONS
THEY DO NOT
GO TO THE LENGTH OF DENYING THE PRE EXISTENCE OF IDEAS
SIMMIAS IS OF
OPINION THAT THE SOUL IS A HARMONY OF THE BODY
BUT THE ADMISSION OF THE
PRE EXISTENCE OF IDEAS AND THEREFORE OF THE SOUL IS AT VARIANCE WITH
THIS
COMPARE A PARALLEL DIFFICULTY IN THEAET FOR A HARMONY IS
AN EFFECT WHEREAS THE SOUL IS NOT AN EFFECT BUT A CAUSE A HARMONY
FOLLOWS BUT THE SOUL LEADS A HARMONY ADMITS OF DEGREES AND THE SOUL
HAS NO DEGREES
AGAIN UPON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE SOUL IS A HARMONY
WHY IS ONE SOUL BETTER THAN ANOTHER ARE THEY MORE OR LESS HARMONIZED
OR IS THERE ONE HARMONY WITHIN ANOTHER BUT THE SOUL DOES NOT ADMIT OF
DEGREES AND CANNOT THEREFORE BE MORE OR LESS HARMONIZED
FURTHER THE
SOUL IS OFTEN ENGAGED IN RESISTING THE AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY AS HOMER
DESCRIBES ODYSSEUS 'REBUKING HIS HEART COULD HE HAVE WRITTEN THIS
UNDER THE IDEA THAT THE SOUL IS A HARMONY OF THE BODY NAY RATHER ARE
WE NOT CONTRADICTING HOMER AND OURSELVES IN AFFIRMING ANYTHING OF THE
SORT
THE GODDESS HARMONIA AS SOCRATES PLAYFULLY TERMS THE ARGUMENT OF
SIMMIAS HAS BEEN HAPPILY DISPOSED OF AND NOW AN ANSWER HAS TO BE GIVEN
TO THE THEBAN CADMUS
SOCRATES RECAPITULATES THE ARGUMENT OF CEBES
WHICH AS HE REMARKS INVOLVES THE WHOLE QUESTION OF NATURAL GROWTH OR
CAUSATION ABOUT THIS HE PROPOSES TO NARRATE HIS OWN MENTAL EXPERIENCE
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG HE HAD PUZZLED HIMSELF WITH PHYSICS HE HAD ENQUIRED
INTO THE GROWTH AND DECAY OF ANIMALS AND THE ORIGIN OF THOUGHT UNTIL
AT LAST HE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE SELF EVIDENT FACT THAT GROWTH IS THE
RESULT OF EATING AND DRINKING AND SO HE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT
HE WAS NOT MEANT FOR SUCH ENQUIRIES
NOR WAS HE LESS PERPLEXED WITH
NOTIONS OF COMPARISON AND NUMBER
AT FIRST HE HAD IMAGINED HIMSELF TO
UNDERSTAND DIFFERENCES OF GREATER AND LESS AND TO KNOW THAT TEN IS TWO
MORE THAN EIGHT AND THE LIKE
BUT NOW THOSE VERY NOTIONS APPEARED TO
HIM TO CONTAIN A CONTRADICTION
FOR HOW CAN ONE BE DIVIDED INTO TWO OR
TWO BE COMPOUNDED INTO ONE THESE ARE DIFFICULTIES WHICH SOCRATES CANNOT
ANSWER
OF GENERATION AND DESTRUCTION HE KNOWS NOTHING
BUT HE HAS A
CONFUSED NOTION OF ANOTHER METHOD IN WHICH MATTERS OF THIS SORT ARE TO
BE INVESTIGATED
COMPARE REPUBLIC CHARM
THEN HE HEARD SOME ONE READING OUT OF A BOOK OF ANAXAGORAS THAT MIND IS
THE CAUSE OF ALL THINGS
AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF MIND IS THE CAUSE
OF ALL THINGS SURELY MIND MUST DISPOSE THEM ALL FOR THE BEST
THE NEW
TEACHER WILL SHOW ME THIS 'ORDER OF THE BEST' IN MAN AND NATURE
HOW
GREAT HAD BEEN HIS HOPES AND HOW GREAT HIS DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HE FOUND
THAT HIS NEW FRIEND WAS ANYTHING BUT CONSISTENT IN HIS USE OF MIND AS
A CAUSE AND THAT HE SOON INTRODUCED WINDS WATERS AND OTHER ECCENTRIC
NOTIONS
COMPARE ARIST
METAPH IT WAS AS IF A PERSON HAD SAID THAT
SOCRATES IS SITTING HERE BECAUSE HE IS MADE UP OF BONES AND MUSCLES
INSTEAD OF TELLING THE TRUE REASON THAT HE IS HERE BECAUSE THE
ATHENIANS HAVE THOUGHT GOOD TO SENTENCE HIM TO DEATH AND HE HAS THOUGHT
GOOD TO AWAIT HIS SENTENCE
HAD HIS BONES AND MUSCLES BEEN LEFT BY HIM
TO THEIR OWN IDEAS OF RIGHT THEY WOULD LONG AGO HAVE TAKEN THEMSELVES
OFF
BUT SURELY THERE IS A GREAT CONFUSION OF THE CAUSE AND CONDITION
IN ALL THIS
AND THIS CONFUSION ALSO LEADS PEOPLE INTO ALL SORTS OF
ERRONEOUS THEORIES ABOUT THE POSITION AND MOTIONS OF THE EARTH
NONE OF
THEM KNOW HOW MUCH STRONGER THAN ANY ATLAS IS THE POWER OF THE BEST
BUT
THIS 'BEST' IS STILL UNDISCOVERED AND IN ENQUIRING AFTER THE CAUSE WE
CAN ONLY HOPE TO ATTAIN THE SECOND BEST
NOW THERE IS A DANGER IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THE NATURE OF THINGS AS
THERE IS A DANGER IN LOOKING AT THE SUN DURING AN ECLIPSE UNLESS THE
PRECAUTION IS TAKEN OF LOOKING ONLY AT THE IMAGE REFLECTED IN THE WATER
OR IN A GLASS
COMPARE LAWS REPUBLIC 'I WAS AFRAID SAYS SOCRATES
'THAT I MIGHT INJURE THE EYE OF THE SOUL
I THOUGHT THAT I HAD BETTER
RETURN TO THE OLD AND SAFE METHOD OF IDEAS
THOUGH I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY
THAT HE WHO CONTEMPLATES EXISTENCE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF IDEAS SEES
ONLY THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY ANY MORE THAN HE WHO CONTEMPLATES ACTUAL
EFFECTS
IF THE EXISTENCE OF IDEAS IS GRANTED TO HIM SOCRATES IS OF OPINION THAT
HE WILL THEN HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN PROVING THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL
HE WILL ONLY ASK FOR A FURTHER ADMISSION THAT BEAUTY IS THE CAUSE OF
THE BEAUTIFUL GREATNESS THE CAUSE OF THE GREAT SMALLNESS OF THE SMALL
AND SO ON OF OTHER THINGS
THIS IS A SAFE AND SIMPLE ANSWER WHICH
ESCAPES THE CONTRADICTIONS OF GREATER AND LESS GREATER BY REASON OF
THAT WHICH IS SMALLER OF ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION AND THE OTHER
DIFFICULTIES OF RELATION
THESE SUBTLETIES HE IS FOR LEAVING TO WISER
HEADS THAN HIS OWN HE PREFERS TO TEST IDEAS BY THE CONSISTENCY OF THEIR
CONSEQUENCES AND IF ASKED TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEM GOES BACK TO
SOME HIGHER IDEA OR HYPOTHESIS WHICH APPEARS TO HIM TO BE THE BEST
UNTIL AT LAST HE ARRIVES AT A RESTING PLACE
REPUBLIC PHIL
THE DOCTRINE OF IDEAS WHICH HAS LONG AGO RECEIVED THE ASSENT OF THE
SOCRATIC CIRCLE IS NOW AFFIRMED BY THE PHLIASIAN AUDITOR TO COMMAND
THE ASSENT OF ANY MAN OF SENSE
THE NARRATIVE IS CONTINUED SOCRATES IS
DESIROUS OF EXPLAINING HOW OPPOSITE IDEAS MAY APPEAR TO CO EXIST BUT DO
NOT REALLY CO EXIST IN THE SAME THING OR PERSON
FOR EXAMPLE SIMMIAS
MAY BE SAID TO HAVE GREATNESS AND ALSO SMALLNESS BECAUSE HE IS GREATER
THAN SOCRATES AND LESS THAN PHAEDO
AND YET SIMMIAS IS NOT REALLY GREAT
AND ALSO SMALL BUT ONLY WHEN COMPARED TO PHAEDO AND SOCRATES
I USE THE
ILLUSTRATION SAYS SOCRATES BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW YOU NOT ONLY THAT
IDEAL OPPOSITES EXCLUDE ONE ANOTHER BUT ALSO THE OPPOSITES IN US
I
FOR EXAMPLE HAVING THE ATTRIBUTE OF SMALLNESS REMAIN SMALL AND CANNOT
BECOME GREAT THE SMALLNESS WHICH IS IN ME DRIVES OUT GREATNESS
ONE OF THE COMPANY HERE REMARKED THAT THIS WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE
OLD ASSERTION THAT OPPOSITES GENERATED OPPOSITES
BUT THAT REPLIES
SOCRATES WAS AFFIRMED NOT OF OPPOSITE IDEAS EITHER IN US OR IN
NATURE BUT OF OPPOSITION IN THE CONCRETE NOT OF LIFE AND DEATH BUT
OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING AND DYING
WHEN THIS OBJECTION HAS BEEN REMOVED
SOCRATES PROCEEDS THIS DOCTRINE OF THE MUTUAL EXCLUSION OF OPPOSITES
IS NOT ONLY TRUE OF THE OPPOSITES THEMSELVES BUT OF THINGS WHICH ARE
INSEPARABLE FROM THEM
FOR EXAMPLE COLD AND HEAT ARE OPPOSED AND FIRE
WHICH IS INSEPARABLE FROM HEAT CANNOT CO EXIST WITH COLD OR SNOW
WHICH IS INSEPARABLE FROM COLD WITH HEAT
AGAIN THE NUMBER THREE
EXCLUDES THE NUMBER FOUR BECAUSE THREE IS AN ODD NUMBER AND FOUR IS
AN EVEN NUMBER AND THE ODD IS OPPOSED TO THE EVEN
THUS WE ARE ABLE TO
PROCEED A STEP BEYOND 'THE SAFE AND SIMPLE ANSWER WE MAY SAY NOT
ONLY THAT THE ODD EXCLUDES THE EVEN BUT THAT THE NUMBER THREE WHICH
PARTICIPATES IN ODDNESS EXCLUDES THE EVEN
AND IN LIKE MANNER NOT ONLY
DOES LIFE EXCLUDE DEATH BUT THE SOUL OF WHICH LIFE IS THE INSEPARABLE
ATTRIBUTE ALSO EXCLUDES DEATH
AND THAT OF WHICH LIFE IS THE
INSEPARABLE ATTRIBUTE IS BY THE FORCE OF THE TERMS IMPERISHABLE
IF THE
ODD PRINCIPLE WERE IMPERISHABLE THEN THE NUMBER THREE WOULD NOT PERISH
BUT REMOVE ON THE APPROACH OF THE EVEN PRINCIPLE
BUT THE IMMORTAL IS
IMPERISHABLE AND THEREFORE THE SOUL ON THE APPROACH OF DEATH DOES NOT
PERISH BUT REMOVES
THUS ALL OBJECTIONS APPEAR TO BE FINALLY SILENCED
AND NOW THE
APPLICATION HAS TO BE MADE IF THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL 'WHAT MANNER OF
PERSONS OUGHT WE TO BE HAVING REGARD NOT ONLY TO TIME BUT TO ETERNITY
FOR DEATH IS NOT THE END OF ALL AND THE WICKED IS NOT RELEASED FROM HIS
EVIL BY DEATH BUT EVERY ONE CARRIES WITH HIM INTO THE WORLD BELOW THAT
WHICH HE IS OR HAS BECOME AND THAT ONLY
FOR AFTER DEATH THE SOUL IS CARRIED AWAY TO JUDGMENT AND WHEN SHE HAS
RECEIVED HER PUNISHMENT RETURNS TO EARTH IN THE COURSE OF AGES
THE WISE
SOUL IS CONSCIOUS OF HER SITUATION AND FOLLOWS THE ATTENDANT ANGEL WHO
GUIDES HER THROUGH THE WINDINGS OF THE WORLD BELOW BUT THE IMPURE SOUL
WANDERS HITHER AND THITHER WITHOUT COMPANION OR GUIDE AND IS CARRIED
AT LAST TO HER OWN PLACE AS THE PURE SOUL IS ALSO CARRIED AWAY TO HERS
'IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND THIS I MUST FIRST DESCRIBE TO YOU THE
NATURE AND CONFORMATION OF THE EARTH
NOW THE WHOLE EARTH IS A GLOBE PLACED IN THE CENTRE OF THE HEAVENS AND
IS MAINTAINED THERE BY THE PERFECTION OF BALANCE
THAT WHICH WE CALL THE
EARTH IS ONLY ONE OF MANY SMALL HOLLOWS WHEREIN COLLECT THE MISTS AND
WATERS AND THE THICK LOWER AIR BUT THE TRUE EARTH IS ABOVE AND IS IN
A FINER AND SUBTLER ELEMENT
AND IF LIKE BIRDS WE COULD FLY TO THE
SURFACE OF THE AIR IN THE SAME MANNER THAT FISHES COME TO THE TOP OF
THE SEA THEN WE SHOULD BEHOLD THE TRUE EARTH AND THE TRUE HEAVEN AND
THE TRUE STARS
OUR EARTH IS EVERYWHERE CORRUPTED AND CORRODED AND EVEN
THE LAND WHICH IS FAIRER THAN THE SEA FOR THAT IS A MERE CHAOS OR WASTE
OF WATER AND MUD AND SAND HAS NOTHING TO SHOW IN COMPARISON OF THE
OTHER WORLD
BUT THE HEAVENLY EARTH IS OF DIVERS COLOURS SPARKLING WITH
JEWELS BRIGHTER THAN GOLD AND WHITER THAN ANY SNOW HAVING FLOWERS AND
FRUITS INNUMERABLE
AND THE INHABITANTS DWELL SOME ON THE SHORE OF THE
SEA OF AIR OTHERS IN 'ISLETS OF THE BLEST AND THEY HOLD CONVERSE
WITH THE GODS AND BEHOLD THE SUN MOON AND STARS AS THEY TRULY ARE AND
THEIR OTHER BLESSEDNESS IS OF A PIECE WITH THIS
THE HOLLOWS ON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE VARY IN SIZE AND SHAPE FROM THAT
WHICH WE INHABIT BUT ALL ARE CONNECTED BY PASSAGES AND PERFORATIONS IN
THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH
AND THERE IS ONE HUGE CHASM OR OPENING CALLED
TARTARUS INTO WHICH STREAMS OF FIRE AND WATER AND LIQUID MUD ARE EVER
FLOWING OF THESE SMALL PORTIONS FIND THEIR WAY TO THE SURFACE AND
FORM SEAS AND RIVERS AND VOLCANOES
THERE IS A PERPETUAL INHALATION AND
EXHALATION OF THE AIR RISING AND FALLING AS THE WATERS PASS INTO THE
DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AND RETURN AGAIN IN THEIR COURSE FORMING LAKES
AND RIVERS BUT NEVER DESCENDING BELOW THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH FOR ON
EITHER SIDE THE RIVERS FLOWING EITHER WAY ARE STOPPED BY A PRECIPICE
THESE RIVERS ARE MANY AND MIGHTY AND THERE ARE FOUR PRINCIPAL ONES
OCEANUS ACHERON PYRIPHLEGETHON AND COCYTUS
OCEANUS IS THE RIVER
WHICH ENCIRCLES THE EARTH ACHERON TAKES AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND
AFTER FLOWING UNDER THE EARTH THROUGH DESERT PLACES AT LAST REACHES THE
ACHERUSIAN LAKE THIS IS THE RIVER AT WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD AWAIT
THEIR RETURN TO EARTH
PYRIPHLEGETHON IS A STREAM OF FIRE WHICH COILS
ROUND THE EARTH AND FLOWS INTO THE DEPTHS OF TARTARUS
THE FOURTH RIVER
COCYTUS IS THAT WHICH IS CALLED BY THE POETS THE STYGIAN RIVER AND
PASSES INTO AND FORMS THE LAKE STYX FROM THE WATERS OF WHICH IT GAINS
NEW AND STRANGE POWERS
THIS RIVER TOO FALLS INTO TARTARUS
THE DEAD ARE FIRST OF ALL JUDGED ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEDS AND THOSE WHO
ARE INCURABLE ARE THRUST INTO TARTARUS FROM WHICH THEY NEVER COME OUT
THOSE WHO HAVE ONLY COMMITTED VENIAL SINS ARE FIRST PURIFIED OF THEM
AND THEN REWARDED FOR THE GOOD WHICH THEY HAVE DONE
THOSE WHO HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES GREAT INDEED BUT NOT UNPARDONABLE ARE THRUST
INTO TARTARUS BUT ARE CAST FORTH AT THE END OF A YEAR BY WAY OF
PYRIPHLEGETHON OR COCYTUS AND THESE CARRY THEM AS FAR AS THE ACHERUSIAN
LAKE WHERE THEY CALL UPON THEIR VICTIMS TO LET THEM COME OUT OF THE
RIVERS INTO THE LAKE
AND IF THEY PREVAIL THEN THEY ARE LET OUT AND
THEIR SUFFERINGS CEASE IF NOT THEY ARE BORNE UNCEASINGLY INTO TARTARUS
AND BACK AGAIN UNTIL THEY AT LAST OBTAIN MERCY
THE PURE SOULS ALSO
RECEIVE THEIR REWARD AND HAVE THEIR ABODE IN THE UPPER EARTH AND A
SELECT FEW IN STILL FAIRER 'MANSIONS
SOCRATES IS NOT PREPARED TO INSIST ON THE LITERAL ACCURACY OF THIS
DESCRIPTION BUT HE IS CONFIDENT THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND IS TRUE
HE WHO HAS SOUGHT AFTER THE PLEASURES OF KNOWLEDGE AND REJECTED THE
PLEASURES OF THE BODY HAS REASON TO BE OF GOOD HOPE AT THE APPROACH OF
DEATH WHOSE VOICE IS ALREADY SPEAKING TO HIM AND WHO WILL ONE DAY BE
HEARD CALLING ALL MEN
THE HOUR HAS COME AT WHICH HE MUST DRINK THE POISON AND NOT MUCH
REMAINS TO BE DONE
HOW SHALL THEY BURY HIM THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH HE
REFUSES TO ENTERTAIN FOR THEY ARE BURYING NOT HIM BUT HIS DEAD BODY
HIS FRIENDS HAD ONCE BEEN SURETIES THAT HE WOULD REMAIN AND THEY SHALL
NOW BE SURETIES THAT HE HAS RUN AWAY
YET HE WOULD NOT DIE WITHOUT THE
CUSTOMARY CEREMONIES OF WASHING AND BURIAL
SHALL HE MAKE A LIBATION OF
THE POISON IN THE SPIRIT HE WILL BUT NOT IN THE LETTER
ONE REQUEST HE
UTTERS IN THE VERY ACT OF DEATH WHICH HAS BEEN A PUZZLE TO AFTER AGES
WITH A SORT OF IRONY HE REMEMBERS THAT A TRIFLING RELIGIOUS DUTY IS
STILL UNFULFILLED JUST AS ABOVE HE DESIRES BEFORE HE DEPARTS TO COMPOSE
A FEW VERSES IN ORDER TO SATISFY A SCRUPLE ABOUT A DREAM UNLESS
INDEED WE SUPPOSE HIM TO MEAN THAT HE WAS NOW RESTORED TO HEALTH AND
MADE THE CUSTOMARY OFFERING TO ASCLEPIUS IN TOKEN OF HIS RECOVERY
1
THE DOCTRINE OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL HAS SUNK DEEP INTO
THE HEART OF THE HUMAN RACE AND MEN ARE APT TO REBEL AGAINST ANY
EXAMINATION OF THE NATURE OR GROUNDS OF THEIR BELIEF
THEY DO NOT LIKE
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AS WELL AS THE OTHER 'ETERNAL IDEAS OF
MAN HAS A HISTORY IN TIME WHICH MAY BE TRACED IN GREEK POETRY OR
PHILOSOPHY AND ALSO IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES
THEY CONVERT FEELING INTO
REASONING AND THROW A NETWORK OF DIALECTICS OVER THAT WHICH IS REALLY
A DEEPLY ROOTED INSTINCT
IN THE SAME TEMPER WHICH SOCRATES REPROVES IN
HIMSELF THEY ARE DISPOSED TO THINK THAT EVEN FALLACIES WILL DO NO HARM
FOR THEY WILL DIE WITH THEM AND WHILE THEY LIVE THEY WILL GAIN BY THE
DELUSION
AND WHEN THEY CONSIDER THE NUMBERLESS BAD ARGUMENTS WHICH HAVE
BEEN PRESSED INTO THE SERVICE OF THEOLOGY THEY SAY LIKE THE COMPANIONS
OF SOCRATES 'WHAT ARGUMENT CAN WE EVER TRUST AGAIN BUT THERE IS A
BETTER AND HIGHER SPIRIT TO BE GATHERED FROM THE PHAEDO AS WELL AS FROM
THE OTHER WRITINGS OF PLATO WHICH SAYS THAT FIRST PRINCIPLES SHOULD
BE MOST CONSTANTLY REVIEWED PHAEDO AND CRAT AND THAT THE HIGHEST
SUBJECTS DEMAND OF US THE GREATEST ACCURACY REPUBLIC ALSO THAT WE
MUST NOT BECOME MISOLOGISTS BECAUSE ARGUMENTS ARE APT TO BE DECEIVERS
2
IN FORMER AGES THERE WAS A CUSTOMARY RATHER THAN A REASONED BELIEF
IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL
IT WAS BASED ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE
CHURCH ON THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A BELIEF TO MORALITY AND THE ORDER OF
SOCIETY ON THE EVIDENCE OF AN HISTORICAL FACT AND ALSO ON ANALOGIES
AND FIGURES OF SPEECH WHICH FILLED UP THE VOID OR GAVE AN EXPRESSION
IN WORDS TO A CHERISHED INSTINCT
THE MASS OF MANKIND WENT ON THEIR
WAY BUSY WITH THE AFFAIRS OF THIS LIFE HARDLY STOPPING TO THINK ABOUT
ANOTHER
BUT IN OUR OWN DAY THE QUESTION HAS BEEN REOPENED AND IT IS
DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE BELIEF WHICH IN THE FIRST AGES OF CHRISTIANITY
WAS THE STRONGEST MOTIVE OF ACTION CAN SURVIVE THE CONFLICT WITH A
SCIENTIFIC AGE IN WHICH THE RULES OF EVIDENCE ARE STRICTER AND THE MIND
HAS BECOME MORE SENSITIVE TO CRITICISM
IT HAS FADED INTO THE DISTANCE
BY A NATURAL PROCESS AS IT WAS REMOVED FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM THE
HISTORICAL FACT ON WHICH IT HAS BEEN SUPPOSED TO REST
ARGUMENTS DERIVED
FROM MATERIAL THINGS SUCH AS THE SEED AND THE EAR OF CORN OR TRANSITIONS
IN THE LIFE OF ANIMALS FROM ONE STATE OF BEING TO ANOTHER THE CHRYSALIS
AND THE BUTTERFLY ARE NOT 'IN PARI MATERIA' WITH ARGUMENTS FROM
THE VISIBLE TO THE INVISIBLE AND ARE THEREFORE FELT TO BE NO LONGER
APPLICABLE
THE EVIDENCE TO THE HISTORICAL FACT SEEMS TO BE WEAKER THAN
WAS ONCE SUPPOSED IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH ITSELF AND IS BASED UPON
DOCUMENTS WHICH ARE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN
THE IMMORTALITY OF MAN MUST BE
PROVED BY OTHER ARGUMENTS THAN THESE IF IT IS AGAIN TO BECOME A LIVING
BELIEF
WE MUST ASK OURSELVES AFRESH WHY WE STILL MAINTAIN IT AND SEEK
TO DISCOVER A FOUNDATION FOR IT IN THE NATURE OF GOD AND IN THE FIRST
PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY
3
AT THE OUTSET OF THE DISCUSSION WE MAY CLEAR AWAY A CONFUSION
WE
CERTAINLY DO NOT MEAN BY THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL THE IMMORTALITY OF
FAME WHICH WHETHER WORTH HAVING OR NOT CAN ONLY BE ASCRIBED TO A VERY
SELECT CLASS OF THE WHOLE RACE OF MANKIND AND EVEN THE INTEREST IN
THESE FEW IS COMPARATIVELY SHORT LIVED
TO HAVE BEEN A BENEFACTOR TO THE
WORLD WHETHER IN A HIGHER OR A LOWER SPHERE OF LIFE AND THOUGHT IS A
GREAT THING TO HAVE THE REPUTATION OF BEING ONE WHEN MEN HAVE PASSED
OUT OF THE SPHERE OF EARTHLY PRAISE OR BLAME IS HARDLY WORTHY OF
CONSIDERATION
THE MEMORY OF A GREAT MAN SO FAR FROM BEING IMMORTAL
IS REALLY LIMITED TO HIS OWN GENERATION SO LONG AS HIS FRIENDS OR HIS
DISCIPLES ARE ALIVE SO LONG AS HIS BOOKS CONTINUE TO BE READ SO LONG
AS HIS POLITICAL OR MILITARY SUCCESSES FILL A PAGE IN THE HISTORY OF
HIS COUNTRY
THE PRAISES WHICH ARE BESTOWED UPON HIM AT HIS DEATH HARDLY
LAST LONGER THAN THE FLOWERS WHICH ARE STREWED UPON HIS COFFIN OR THE
'IMMORTELLES' WHICH ARE LAID UPON HIS TOMB
LITERATURE MAKES THE MOST
OF ITS HEROES BUT THE TRUE MAN IS WELL AWARE THAT FAR FROM ENJOYING AN
IMMORTALITY OF FAME IN A GENERATION OR TWO OR EVEN IN A MUCH SHORTER
TIME HE WILL BE FORGOTTEN AND THE WORLD WILL GET ON WITHOUT HIM
4
MODERN PHILOSOPHY IS PERPLEXED AT THIS WHOLE QUESTION WHICH IS
SOMETIMES FAIRLY GIVEN UP AND HANDED OVER TO THE REALM OF FAITH
THE
PERPLEXITY SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN BY US WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO SUBMIT THE
PHAEDO OF PLATO TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOGIC
FOR WHAT IDEA CAN WE FORM
OF THE SOUL WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE BODY OR HOW CAN THE SOUL BE UNITED
WITH THE BODY AND STILL BE INDEPENDENT IS THE SOUL RELATED TO THE
BODY AS THE IDEAL TO THE REAL OR AS THE WHOLE TO THE PARTS OR AS THE
SUBJECT TO THE OBJECT OR AS THE CAUSE TO THE EFFECT OR AS THE END TO
THE MEANS SHALL WE SAY WITH ARISTOTLE THAT THE SOUL IS THE ENTELECHY
OR FORM OF AN ORGANIZED LIVING BODY OR WITH PLATO THAT SHE HAS A LIFE
OF HER OWN IS THE PYTHAGOREAN IMAGE OF THE HARMONY OR THAT OF THE
MONAD THE TRUER EXPRESSION IS THE SOUL RELATED TO THE BODY AS SIGHT TO
THE EYE OR AS THE BOATMAN TO HIS BOAT ARIST
DE ANIM AND IN
ANOTHER STATE OF BEING IS THE SOUL TO BE CONCEIVED OF AS VANISHING INTO
INFINITY HARDLY POSSESSING AN EXISTENCE WHICH SHE CAN CALL HER OWN
AS IN THE PANTHEISTIC SYSTEM OF SPINOZA OR AS AN INDIVIDUAL INFORMING
ANOTHER BODY AND ENTERING INTO NEW RELATIONS BUT RETAINING HER OWN
CHARACTER COMPARE GORGIAS OR IS THE OPPOSITION OF SOUL AND BODY A
MERE ILLUSION AND THE TRUE SELF NEITHER SOUL NOR BODY BUT THE UNION
OF THE TWO IN THE 'I' WHICH IS ABOVE THEM AND IS DEATH THE ASSERTION
OF THIS INDIVIDUALITY IN THE HIGHER NATURE AND THE FALLING AWAY INTO
NOTHINGNESS OF THE LOWER OR ARE WE VAINLY ATTEMPTING TO PASS
THE BOUNDARIES OF HUMAN THOUGHT THE BODY AND THE SOUL SEEM TO BE
INSEPARABLE NOT ONLY IN FACT BUT IN OUR CONCEPTIONS OF THEM AND ANY
PHILOSOPHY WHICH TOO CLOSELY UNITES THEM OR TOO WIDELY SEPARATES THEM
EITHER IN THIS LIFE OR IN ANOTHER DISTURBS THE BALANCE OF HUMAN NATURE
NO THINKER HAS PERFECTLY ADJUSTED THEM OR BEEN ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH
HIMSELF IN DESCRIBING THEIR RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER
NOR CAN WE
WONDER THAT PLATO IN THE INFANCY OF HUMAN THOUGHT SHOULD HAVE CONFUSED
MYTHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY OR HAVE MISTAKEN VERBAL ARGUMENTS FOR REAL
ONES
5
AGAIN BELIEVING IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL WE MUST STILL
ASK THE QUESTION OF SOCRATES 'WHAT IS THAT WHICH WE SUPPOSE TO BE
IMMORTAL IS IT THE PERSONAL AND INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT IN US OR THE
SPIRITUAL AND UNIVERSAL IS IT THE PRINCIPLE OF KNOWLEDGE OR OF
GOODNESS OR THE UNION OF THE TWO IS IT THE MERE FORCE OF LIFE WHICH IS
DETERMINED TO BE OR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SELF WHICH CANNOT BE GOT RID
OF OR THE FIRE OF GENIUS WHICH REFUSES TO BE EXTINGUISHED OR IS THERE
A HIDDEN BEING WHICH IS ALLIED TO THE AUTHOR OF ALL EXISTENCE WHO IS
BECAUSE HE IS PERFECT AND TO WHOM OUR IDEAS OF PERFECTION GIVE US A
TITLE TO BELONG WHATEVER ANSWER IS GIVEN BY US TO THESE QUESTIONS
THERE STILL REMAINS THE NECESSITY OF ALLOWING THE PERMANENCE OF EVIL IF
NOT FOR EVER AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME IN ORDER THAT THE WICKED 'MAY NOT
HAVE TOO GOOD A BARGAIN FOR THE ANNIHILATION OF EVIL AT DEATH OR THE
ETERNAL DURATION OF IT SEEM TO INVOLVE EQUAL DIFFICULTIES IN THE MORAL
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE
SOMETIMES WE ARE LED BY OUR FEELINGS RATHER
THAN BY OUR REASON TO THINK OF THE GOOD AND WISE ONLY AS EXISTING IN
ANOTHER LIFE
WHY SHOULD THE MEAN THE WEAK THE IDIOT THE INFANT
THE HERD OF MEN WHO HAVE NEVER IN ANY PROPER SENSE THE USE OF REASON
REAPPEAR WITH BLINKING EYES IN THE LIGHT OF ANOTHER WORLD BUT OUR
SECOND THOUGHT IS THAT THE HOPE OF HUMANITY IS A COMMON ONE AND THAT
ALL OR NONE WILL BE PARTAKERS OF IMMORTALITY
REASON DOES NOT ALLOW US
TO SUPPOSE THAT WE HAVE ANY GREATER CLAIMS THAN OTHERS AND EXPERIENCE
MAY OFTEN REVEAL TO US UNEXPECTED FLASHES OF THE HIGHER NATURE IN
THOSE WHOM WE HAD DESPISED
WHY SHOULD THE WICKED SUFFER ANY MORE THAN
OURSELVES HAD WE BEEN PLACED IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN
ANY BETTER THAN THEY THE WORST OF MEN ARE OBJECTS OF PITY RATHER THAN
OF ANGER TO THE PHILANTHROPIST MUST THEY NOT BE EQUALLY SUCH TO DIVINE
BENEVOLENCE EVEN MORE THAN THE GOOD THEY HAVE NEED OF ANOTHER LIFE NOT
THAT THEY MAY BE PUNISHED BUT THAT THEY MAY BE EDUCATED
THESE ARE
A FEW OF THE REFLECTIONS WHICH ARISE IN OUR MINDS WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO
ASSIGN ANY FORM TO OUR CONCEPTIONS OF A FUTURE STATE
THERE ARE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS WHICH ARE DISTURBING TO US BECAUSE WE
HAVE NO ANSWER TO THEM
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF THE ANIMALS IN A FUTURE
STATE HAVE WE NOT SEEN DOGS MORE FAITHFUL AND INTELLIGENT THAN MEN
AND MEN WHO ARE MORE STUPID AND BRUTAL THAN ANY ANIMALS DOES THEIR LIFE
CEASE AT DEATH OR IS THERE SOME 'BETTER THING RESERVED' ALSO FOR
THEM THEY MAY BE SAID TO HAVE A SHADOW OR IMITATION OF MORALITY AND
IMPERFECT MORAL CLAIMS UPON THE BENEVOLENCE OF MAN AND UPON THE JUSTICE
OF GOD
WE CANNOT THINK OF THE LEAST OR LOWEST OF THEM THE INSECT THE
BIRD THE INHABITANTS OF THE SEA OR THE DESERT AS HAVING ANY PLACE IN
A FUTURE WORLD AND IF NOT ALL WHY SHOULD THOSE WHO ARE SPECIALLY
ATTACHED TO MAN BE DEEMED WORTHY OF ANY EXCEPTIONAL PRIVILEGE WHEN WE
REASON ABOUT SUCH A SUBJECT ALMOST AT ONCE WE DEGENERATE INTO NONSENSE
IT IS A PASSING THOUGHT WHICH HAS NO REAL HOLD ON THE MIND
WE MAY ARGUE
FOR THE EXISTENCE OF ANIMALS IN A FUTURE STATE FROM THE ATTRIBUTES OF
GOD OR FROM TEXTS OF SCRIPTURE 'ARE NOT TWO SPARROWS SOLD FOR ONE
FARTHING ETC BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT WE ARE ONLY FILLING UP THE VOID
OF ANOTHER WORLD WITH OUR OWN FANCIES
AGAIN WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT
THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THAT GREAT BUGBEAR OF THEOLOGIANS BY WHICH THEY
FRIGHTEN US INTO BELIEVING ANY SUPERSTITION
WHAT ANSWER CAN BE MADE
TO THE OLD COMMONPLACE 'IS NOT GOD THE AUTHOR OF EVIL IF HE KNOWINGLY
PERMITTED BUT COULD HAVE PREVENTED IT EVEN IF WE ASSUME THAT THE
INEQUALITIES OF THIS LIFE ARE RECTIFIED BY SOME TRANSPOSITION OF HUMAN
BEINGS IN ANOTHER STILL THE EXISTENCE OF THE VERY LEAST EVIL IF IT
COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED SEEMS TO BE AT VARIANCE WITH THE LOVE AND
JUSTICE OF GOD
AND SO WE ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT WE ARE CARRYING
LOGIC TOO FAR AND THAT THE ATTEMPT TO FRAME THE WORLD ACCORDING TO A
RULE OF DIVINE PERFECTION IS OPPOSED TO EXPERIENCE AND HAD BETTER BE
GIVEN UP
THE CASE OF THE ANIMALS IS OUR OWN
WE MUST ADMIT THAT THE
DIVINE BEING ALTHOUGH PERFECT HIMSELF HAS PLACED US IN A STATE OF LIFE
IN WHICH WE MAY WORK TOGETHER WITH HIM FOR GOOD BUT WE ARE VERY FAR
FROM HAVING ATTAINED TO IT
6
AGAIN IDEAS MUST BE GIVEN THROUGH SOMETHING AND WE ARE ALWAYS PRONE
TO ARGUE ABOUT THE SOUL FROM ANALOGIES OF OUTWARD THINGS WHICH MAY SERVE
TO EMBODY OUR THOUGHTS BUT ARE ALSO PARTLY DELUSIVE
FOR WE CANNOT
REASON FROM THE NATURAL TO THE SPIRITUAL OR FROM THE OUTWARD TO THE
INWARD
THE PROGRESS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SCIENCE WITHOUT BRINGING US
NEARER TO THE GREAT SECRET HAS TENDED TO REMOVE SOME ERRONEOUS NOTIONS
RESPECTING THE RELATIONS OF BODY AND MIND AND IN THIS WE HAVE THE
ADVANTAGE OF THE ANCIENTS
BUT NO ONE IMAGINES THAT ANY SEED OF
IMMORTALITY IS TO BE DISCERNED IN OUR MORTAL FRAMES
MOST PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN CONTENT TO REST THEIR BELIEF IN ANOTHER LIFE ON THE AGREEMENT OF
THE MORE ENLIGHTENED PART OF MANKIND AND ON THE INSEPARABLE CONNECTION
OF SUCH A DOCTRINE WITH THE EXISTENCE OF A GOD ALSO IN A LESS DEGREE
ON THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOUBTING ABOUT THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF THOSE
WHOM WE LOVE AND REVERENCE IN THIS WORLD
AND AFTER ALL HAS BEEN
SAID THE FIGURE THE ANALOGY THE ARGUMENT ARE FELT TO BE ONLY
APPROXIMATIONS IN DIFFERENT FORMS TO AN EXPRESSION OF THE COMMON
SENTIMENT OF THE HUMAN HEART
THAT WE SHALL LIVE AGAIN IS FAR MORE
CERTAIN THAN THAT WE SHALL TAKE ANY PARTICULAR FORM OF LIFE
7
WHEN WE SPEAK OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL WE MUST ASK FURTHER
WHAT WE MEAN BY THE WORD IMMORTALITY
FOR OF THE DURATION OF A LIVING
BEING IN COUNTLESS AGES WE CAN FORM NO CONCEPTION FAR LESS THAN A THREE
YEARS' OLD CHILD OF THE WHOLE OF LIFE
THE NAKED EYE MIGHT AS WELL TRY
TO SEE THE FURTHEST STAR IN THE INFINITY OF HEAVEN
WHETHER TIME AND
SPACE REALLY EXIST WHEN WE TAKE AWAY THE LIMITS OF THEM MAY BE DOUBTED
AT ANY RATE THE THOUGHT OF THEM WHEN UNLIMITED US SO OVERWHELMING TO US
AS TO LOSE ALL DISTINCTNESS
PHILOSOPHERS HAVE SPOKEN OF THEM AS FORMS
OF THE HUMAN MIND BUT WHAT IS THE MIND WITHOUT THEM AS THEN INFINITE
TIME OR AN EXISTENCE OUT OF TIME WHICH ARE THE ONLY POSSIBLE
EXPLANATIONS OF ETERNAL DURATION ARE EQUALLY INCONCEIVABLE TO US LET
US SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND YEARS AFTER DEATH AND
ASK NOT WHAT WILL BE OUR EMPLOYMENT IN ETERNITY BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO
US IN THAT DEFINITE PORTION OF TIME OR WHAT IS NOW HAPPENING TO THOSE
WHO PASSED OUT OF LIFE A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND YEARS AGO
DO WE IMAGINE
THAT THE WICKED ARE SUFFERING TORMENTS OR THAT THE GOOD ARE SINGING THE
PRAISES OF GOD DURING A PERIOD LONGER THAN THAT OF A WHOLE LIFE OR
OF TEN LIVES OF MEN IS THE SUFFERING PHYSICAL OR MENTAL AND DOES THE
WORSHIP OF GOD CONSIST ONLY OF PRAISE OR OF MANY FORMS OF SERVICE WHO
ARE THE WICKED AND WHO ARE THE GOOD WHOM WE VENTURE TO DIVIDE BY A
HARD AND FAST LINE AND IN WHICH OF THE TWO CLASSES SHOULD WE PLACE
OURSELVES AND OUR FRIENDS MAY WE NOT SUSPECT THAT WE ARE MAKING
DIFFERENCES OF KIND BECAUSE WE ARE UNABLE TO IMAGINE DIFFERENCES
OF DEGREE PUTTING THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE INTO HEAVEN OR HELL FOR THE
GREATER CONVENIENCE OF LOGICAL DIVISION ARE WE NOT AT THE SAME TIME
DESCRIBING THEM BOTH IN SUPERLATIVES ONLY THAT WE MAY SATISFY THE
DEMANDS OF RHETORIC WHAT IS THAT PAIN WHICH DOES NOT BECOME DEADENED
AFTER A THOUSAND YEARS OR WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT PLEASURE OR
HAPPINESS WHICH NEVER WEARIES BY MONOTONY EARTHLY PLEASURES AND PAINS
ARE SHORT IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE KEEN OF ANY OTHERS WHICH ARE BOTH
INTENSE AND LASTING WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE AND CAN FORM NO IDEA
THE WORDS OR FIGURES OF SPEECH WHICH WE USE ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH
THEMSELVES
FOR ARE WE NOT IMAGINING HEAVEN UNDER THE SIMILITUDE OF
A CHURCH AND HELL AS A PRISON OR PERHAPS A MADHOUSE OR CHAMBER OF
HORRORS AND YET TO BEINGS CONSTITUTED AS WE ARE THE MONOTONY OF
SINGING PSALMS WOULD BE AS GREAT AN INFLICTION AS THE PAINS OF HELL
AND MIGHT BE EVEN PLEASANTLY INTERRUPTED BY THEM
WHERE ARE THE ACTIONS
WORTHY OF REWARDS GREATER THAN THOSE WHICH ARE CONFERRED ON THE GREATEST
BENEFACTORS OF MANKIND AND WHERE ARE THE CRIMES WHICH ACCORDING TO
PLATO'S MERCIFUL RECKONING MORE MERCIFUL AT ANY RATE THAN THE
ETERNAL DAMNATION OF SO CALLED CHRISTIAN TEACHERS FOR EVERY TEN YEARS
IN THIS LIFE DESERVE A HUNDRED OF PUNISHMENT IN THE LIFE TO COME
WE SHOULD BE READY TO DIE OF PITY IF WE COULD SEE THE LEAST OF THE
SUFFERINGS WHICH THE WRITERS OF INFERNOS AND PURGATORIOS HAVE ATTRIBUTED
TO THE DAMNED
YET THESE JOYS AND TERRORS SEEM HARDLY TO EXERCISE AN
APPRECIABLE INFLUENCE OVER THE LIVES OF MEN
THE WICKED MAN WHEN OLD
IS NOT AS PLATO SUPPOSES REPUBLIC MORE AGITATED BY THE TERRORS OF
ANOTHER WORLD WHEN HE IS NEARER TO THEM NOR THE GOOD IN AN ECSTASY AT
THE JOYS OF WHICH HE IS SOON TO BE THE PARTAKER
AGE NUMBS THE SENSE OF
BOTH WORLDS AND THE HABIT OF LIFE IS STRONGEST IN DEATH
EVEN THE DYING
MOTHER IS DREAMING OF HER LOST CHILDREN AS THEY WERE FORTY OR FIFTY
YEARS BEFORE 'PATTERING OVER THE BOARDS NOT OF REUNION WITH THEM
IN ANOTHER STATE OF BEING
MOST PERSONS WHEN THE LAST HOUR COMES ARE
RESIGNED TO THE ORDER OF NATURE AND THE WILL OF GOD
THEY ARE NOT
THINKING OF DANTE'S INFERNO OR PARADISO OR OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS
HEAVEN AND HELL ARE NOT REALITIES TO THEM BUT WORDS OR IDEAS THE
OUTWARD SYMBOLS OF SOME GREAT MYSTERY THEY HARDLY KNOW WHAT
MANY
NOBLE POEMS AND PICTURES HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE TRADITIONAL
REPRESENTATIONS OF THEM WHICH HAVE BEEN FIXED IN FORMS OF ART AND CAN
NO LONGER BE ALTERED
MANY SERMONS HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH DESCRIPTIONS
OF CELESTIAL OR INFERNAL MANSIONS
BUT HARDLY EVEN IN CHILDHOOD DID THE
THOUGHT OF HEAVEN AND HELL SUPPLY THE MOTIVES OF OUR ACTIONS OR AT ANY
TIME SERIOUSLY AFFECT THE SUBSTANCE OF OUR BELIEF
8
ANOTHER LIFE MUST BE DESCRIBED IF AT ALL IN FORMS OF THOUGHT
AND NOT OF SENSE
TO DRAW PICTURES OF HEAVEN AND HELL WHETHER IN THE
LANGUAGE OF SCRIPTURE OR ANY OTHER ADDS NOTHING TO OUR REAL KNOWLEDGE
BUT MAY PERHAPS DISGUISE OUR IGNORANCE
THE TRUEST CONCEPTION WHICH
WE CAN FORM OF A FUTURE LIFE IS A STATE OF PROGRESS OR EDUCATION A
PROGRESS FROM EVIL TO GOOD FROM IGNORANCE TO KNOWLEDGE
TO THIS WE ARE
LED BY THE ANALOGY OF THE PRESENT LIFE IN WHICH WE SEE DIFFERENT RACES
AND NATIONS OF MEN AND DIFFERENT MEN AND WOMEN OF THE SAME NATION
IN VARIOUS STATES OR STAGES OF CULTIVATION SOME MORE AND SOME LESS
DEVELOPED AND ALL OF THEM CAPABLE OF IMPROVEMENT UNDER FAVOURABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES
THERE ARE PUNISHMENTS TOO OF CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE
GROWING UP INFLICTED BY THEIR PARENTS OF ELDER OFFENDERS WHICH ARE
IMPOSED BY THE LAW OF THE LAND OF ALL MEN AT ALL TIMES OF LIFE
WHICH ARE ATTACHED BY THE LAWS OF NATURE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN
ACTIONS
ALL THESE PUNISHMENTS ARE REALLY EDUCATIONAL THAT IS TO SAY
THEY ARE NOT INTENDED TO RETALIATE ON THE OFFENDER BUT TO TEACH HIM
A LESSON
ALSO THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF CHANCE IN THEM WHICH IS ANOTHER
NAME FOR OUR IGNORANCE OF THE LAWS OF NATURE
THERE IS EVIL TOO
INSEPARABLE FROM GOOD COMPARE LYSIS NOT ALWAYS PUNISHED HERE AS GOOD
IS NOT ALWAYS REWARDED
IT IS CAPABLE OF BEING INDEFINITELY DIMINISHED
AND AS KNOWLEDGE INCREASES THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE MAY MORE AND MORE
DISAPPEAR
FOR WE DO NOT ARGUE MERELY FROM THE ANALOGY OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THIS
WORLD TO ANOTHER BUT FROM THE ANALOGY OF A PROBABLE FUTURE TO WHICH WE
ARE TENDING
THE GREATEST CHANGES OF WHICH WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE AS YET
ARE DUE TO OUR INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY AND OF NATURE
THEY
HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY A FEW MINDS APPEARING IN THREE OR FOUR FAVOURED
NATIONS IN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME
MAY WE BE ALLOWED TO
IMAGINE THE MINDS OF MEN EVERYWHERE WORKING TOGETHER DURING MANY AGES
FOR THE COMPLETION OF OUR KNOWLEDGE MAY NOT THE SCIENCE OF PHYSIOLOGY
TRANSFORM THE WORLD AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF MANKIND HAVE REALLY
EXPERIENCED SOME MORAL IMPROVEMENT ALMOST EVERY ONE FEELS THAT HE HAS
TENDENCIES TO GOOD AND IS CAPABLE OF BECOMING BETTER
AND THESE GERMS
OF GOOD ARE OFTEN FOUND TO BE DEVELOPED BY NEW CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE
STUNTED TREES WHEN TRANSPLANTED TO A BETTER SOIL
THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE SAVAGE AND THE CIVILIZED MAN OR BETWEEN THE CIVILIZED
MAN IN OLD AND NEW COUNTRIES MAY BE INDEFINITELY INCREASED
THE FIRST
DIFFERENCE IS THE EFFECT OF A FEW THOUSAND THE SECOND OF A FEW HUNDRED
YEARS
WE CONGRATULATE OURSELVES THAT SLAVERY HAS BECOME INDUSTRY
THAT LAW AND CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SUPERSEDED DESPOTISM AND
VIOLENCE THAT AN ETHICAL RELIGION HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF FETICHISM
THERE MAY YET COME A TIME WHEN THE MANY MAY BE AS WELL OFF AS THE FEW
WHEN NO ONE WILL BE WEIGHED DOWN BY EXCESSIVE TOIL WHEN THE NECESSITY
OF PROVIDING FOR THE BODY WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH MENTAL IMPROVEMENT
WHEN THE PHYSICAL FRAME MAY BE STRENGTHENED AND DEVELOPED AND THE
RELIGION OF ALL MEN MAY BECOME A REASONABLE SERVICE
NOTHING THEREFORE EITHER IN THE PRESENT STATE OF MAN OR IN THE
TENDENCIES OF THE FUTURE AS FAR AS WE CAN ENTERTAIN CONJECTURE OF THEM
WOULD LEAD US TO SUPPOSE THAT GOD GOVERNS US VINDICTIVELY IN THIS
WORLD AND THEREFORE WE HAVE NO REASON TO INFER THAT HE WILL GOVERN US
VINDICTIVELY IN ANOTHER
THE TRUE ARGUMENT FROM ANALOGY IS NOT 'THIS
LIFE IS A MIXED STATE OF JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE OF GREAT WASTE OF
SUDDEN CASUALTIES OF DISPROPORTIONATE PUNISHMENTS AND THEREFORE THE
LIKE INCONSISTENCIES IRREGULARITIES INJUSTICES ARE TO BE EXPECTED
IN ANOTHER BUT 'THIS LIFE IS SUBJECT TO LAW AND IS IN A STATE OF
PROGRESS AND THEREFORE LAW AND PROGRESS MAY BE BELIEVED TO BE THE
GOVERNING PRINCIPLES OF ANOTHER ALL THE ANALOGIES OF THIS WORLD WOULD
BE AGAINST UNMEANING PUNISHMENTS INFLICTED A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND YEARS
AFTER AN OFFENCE HAD BEEN COMMITTED
SUFFERING THERE MIGHT BE AS A
PART OF EDUCATION BUT NOT HOPELESS OR PROTRACTED AS THERE MIGHT BE
A RETROGRESSION OF INDIVIDUALS OR OF BODIES OF MEN YET NOT SUCH AS TO
INTERFERE WITH A PLAN FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE WHOLE COMPARE LAWS
9
BUT SOME ONE WILL SAY THAT WE CANNOT REASON FROM THE SEEN TO THE
UNSEEN AND THAT WE ARE CREATING ANOTHER WORLD AFTER THE IMAGE OF THIS
JUST AS MEN IN FORMER AGES HAVE CREATED GODS IN THEIR OWN LIKENESS
AND
WE LIKE THE COMPANIONS OF SOCRATES MAY FEEL DISCOURAGED AT HEARING
OUR FAVOURITE 'ARGUMENT FROM ANALOGY' THUS SUMMARILY DISPOSED OF
LIKE
HIMSELF TOO WE MAY ADDUCE OTHER ARGUMENTS IN WHICH HE SEEMS TO HAVE
ANTICIPATED US THOUGH HE EXPRESSES THEM IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGE
FOR WE
FEEL THAT THE SOUL PARTAKES OF THE IDEAL AND INVISIBLE AND CAN NEVER
FALL INTO THE ERROR OF CONFUSING THE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF MAN WITH
HIS HIGHER SELF OR HIS ORIGIN WITH HIS NATURE
IT IS AS REPUGNANT TO
US AS IT WAS TO HIM TO IMAGINE THAT OUR MORAL IDEAS ARE TO BE ATTRIBUTED
ONLY TO CEREBRAL FORCES
THE VALUE OF A HUMAN SOUL LIKE THE VALUE OF A
MAN'S LIFE TO HIMSELF IS INESTIMABLE AND CANNOT BE RECKONED IN EARTHLY
OR MATERIAL THINGS
THE HUMAN BEING ALONE HAS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF TRUTH
AND JUSTICE AND LOVE WHICH IS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF GOD
AND THE SOUL
BECOMING MORE CONSCIOUS OF THESE BECOMES MORE CONSCIOUS OF HER OWN
IMMORTALITY
10
THE LAST GROUND OF OUR BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY AND THE STRONGEST IS
THE PERFECTION OF THE DIVINE NATURE
THE MERE FACT OF THE EXISTENCE OF
GOD DOES NOT TEND TO SHOW THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF MAN
AN EVIL GOD
OR AN INDIFFERENT GOD MIGHT HAVE HAD THE POWER BUT NOT THE WILL TO
PRESERVE US
HE MIGHT HAVE REGARDED US AS FITTED TO MINISTER TO HIS
SERVICE BY A SUCCESSION OF EXISTENCES LIKE THE ANIMALS WITHOUT
ATTRIBUTING TO EACH SOUL AN INCOMPARABLE VALUE
BUT IF HE IS PERFECT
HE MUST WILL THAT ALL RATIONAL BEINGS SHOULD PARTAKE OF THAT PERFECTION
WHICH HE HIMSELF IS
IN THE WORDS OF THE TIMAEUS HE IS GOOD AND
THEREFORE HE DESIRES THAT ALL OTHER THINGS SHOULD BE AS LIKE HIMSELF AS
POSSIBLE
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE ACCOMPLISHES THIS IS BY PERMITTING
EVIL OR RATHER DEGREES OF GOOD WHICH ARE OTHERWISE CALLED EVIL
FOR ALL PROGRESS IS GOOD RELATIVELY TO THE PAST AND YET MAY BE
COMPARATIVELY EVIL WHEN REGARDED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FUTURE
GOOD AND
EVIL ARE RELATIVE TERMS AND DEGREES OF EVIL ARE MERELY THE NEGATIVE
ASPECT OF DEGREES OF GOOD
OF THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF ANY FINITE NATURE
WE CAN FORM NO CONCEPTION WE ARE ALL OF US IN PROCESS OF TRANSITION
FROM ONE DEGREE OF GOOD OR EVIL TO ANOTHER
THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH
ARE URGED ABOUT THE ORIGIN OR EXISTENCE OF EVIL ARE MERE DIALECTICAL
PUZZLES STANDING IN THE SAME RELATION TO CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY AS THE
PUZZLES OF THE CYNICS AND MEGARIANS TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PLATO
THEY
ARISE OUT OF THE TENDENCY OF THE HUMAN MIND TO REGARD GOOD AND EVIL BOTH
AS RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE JUST AS THE RIDDLES ABOUT MOTION ARE TO BE
EXPLAINED BY THE DOUBLE CONCEPTION OF SPACE OR MATTER WHICH THE HUMAN
MIND HAS THE POWER OF REGARDING EITHER AS CONTINUOUS OR DISCRETE
IN SPEAKING OF DIVINE PERFECTION WE MEAN TO SAY THAT GOD IS JUST AND
TRUE AND LOVING THE AUTHOR OF ORDER AND NOT OF DISORDER OF GOOD AND
NOT OF EVIL
OR RATHER THAT HE IS JUSTICE THAT HE IS TRUTH THAT HE
IS LOVE THAT HE IS ORDER THAT HE IS THE VERY PROGRESS OF WHICH WE WERE
SPEAKING AND THAT WHEREVER THESE QUALITIES ARE PRESENT WHETHER IN THE
HUMAN SOUL OR IN THE ORDER OF NATURE THERE IS GOD
WE MIGHT STILL SEE
HIM EVERYWHERE IF WE HAD NOT BEEN MISTAKENLY SEEKING FOR HIM APART FROM
US INSTEAD OF IN US AWAY FROM THE LAWS OF NATURE INSTEAD OF IN
THEM
AND WE BECOME UNITED TO HIM NOT BY MYSTICAL ABSORPTION BUT BY
PARTAKING WHETHER CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY OF THAT TRUTH AND
JUSTICE AND LOVE WHICH HE HIMSELF IS
THUS THE BELIEF IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL RESTS AT LAST ON THE
BELIEF IN GOD
IF THERE IS A GOOD AND WISE GOD THEN THERE IS A PROGRESS
OF MANKIND TOWARDS PERFECTION AND IF THERE IS NO PROGRESS OF MEN
TOWARDS PERFECTION THEN THERE IS NO GOOD AND WISE GOD
WE CANNOT
SUPPOSE THAT THE MORAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD OF WHICH WE SEE THE BEGINNINGS
IN THE WORLD AND IN OURSELVES WILL CEASE WHEN WE PASS OUT OF LIFE
11
CONSIDERING THE 'FEEBLENESS OF THE HUMAN FACULTIES AND THE
UNCERTAINTY OF THE SUBJECT WE ARE INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE FEWER
OUR WORDS THE BETTER
AT THE APPROACH OF DEATH THERE IS NOT MUCH SAID
GOOD MEN ARE TOO HONEST TO GO OUT OF THE WORLD PROFESSING MORE THAN THEY
KNOW
THERE IS PERHAPS NO IMPORTANT SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH AT ANY TIME
EVEN RELIGIOUS PEOPLE SPEAK SO LITTLE TO ONE ANOTHER
IN THE FULNESS
OF LIFE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH IS MOSTLY AWAKENED BY THE SIGHT OR
RECOLLECTION OF THE DEATH OF OTHERS RATHER THAN BY THE PROSPECT OF OUR
OWN
WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE DEGREES OF THE BELIEF IN
IMMORTALITY AND MANY FORMS IN WHICH IT PRESENTS ITSELF TO THE MIND
SOME PERSONS WILL SAY NO MORE THAN THAT THEY TRUST IN GOD AND THAT THEY
LEAVE ALL TO HIM
IT IS A GREAT PART OF TRUE RELIGION NOT TO PRETEND
TO KNOW MORE THAN WE DO
OTHERS WHEN THEY QUIT THIS WORLD ARE COMFORTED
WITH THE HOPE 'THAT THEY WILL SEE AND KNOW THEIR FRIENDS IN HEAVEN BUT
IT IS BETTER TO LEAVE THEM IN THE HANDS OF GOD AND TO BE ASSURED THAT
'NO EVIL SHALL TOUCH THEM THERE ARE OTHERS AGAIN TO WHOM THE BELIEF IN
A DIVINE PERSONALITY HAS CEASED TO HAVE ANY LONGER A MEANING YET THEY
ARE SATISFIED THAT THE END OF ALL IS NOT HERE BUT THAT SOMETHING STILL
REMAINS TO US 'AND SOME BETTER THING FOR THE GOOD THAN FOR THE EVIL
THEY ARE PERSUADED IN SPITE OF THEIR THEOLOGICAL NIHILISM THAT THE
IDEAS OF JUSTICE AND TRUTH AND HOLINESS AND LOVE ARE REALITIES
THEY
CHERISH AN ENTHUSIASTIC DEVOTION TO THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY
THROUGH THESE THEY SEE OR SEEM TO SEE DARKLY AND IN A FIGURE THAT
THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL
BUT BESIDES DIFFERENCES OF THEOLOGICAL OPINION WHICH MUST EVER PREVAIL
ABOUT THINGS UNSEEN THE HOPE OF IMMORTALITY IS WEAKER OR STRONGER IN
MEN AT ONE TIME OF LIFE THAN AT ANOTHER IT EVEN VARIES FROM DAY TO DAY
IT COMES AND GOES THE MIND LIKE THE SKY IS APT TO BE OVERCLOUDED
OTHER GENERATIONS OF MEN MAY HAVE SOMETIMES LIVED UNDER AN 'ECLIPSE OF
FAITH TO US THE TOTAL DISAPPEARANCE OF IT MIGHT BE COMPARED TO THE
'SUN FALLING FROM HEAVEN AND WE MAY SOMETIMES HAVE TO BEGIN AGAIN AND
ACQUIRE THE BELIEF FOR OURSELVES OR TO WIN IT BACK AGAIN WHEN IT IS
LOST
IT IS REALLY WEAKEST IN THE HOUR OF DEATH
FOR NATURE LIKE A KIND
MOTHER OR NURSE LAYS US TO SLEEP WITHOUT FRIGHTENING US PHYSICIANS
WHO ARE THE WITNESSES OF SUCH SCENES SAY THAT UNDER ORDINARY
CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS NO FEAR OF THE FUTURE
OFTEN AS PLATO TELLS
US DEATH IS ACCOMPANIED 'WITH PLEASURE TIM WHEN THE END IS STILL
UNCERTAIN THE CRY OF MANY A ONE HAS BEEN 'PRAY THAT I MAY BE TAKEN
THE LAST THOUGHTS EVEN OF THE BEST MEN DEPEND CHIEFLY ON THE ACCIDENTS
OF THEIR BODILY STATE
PAIN SOON OVERPOWERS THE DESIRE OF LIFE OLD AGE
LIKE THE CHILD IS LAID TO SLEEP ALMOST IN A MOMENT
THE LONG EXPERIENCE
OF LIFE WILL OFTEN DESTROY THE INTEREST WHICH MANKIND HAVE IN IT
SO
VARIOUS ARE THE FEELINGS WITH WHICH DIFFERENT PERSONS DRAW NEAR TO
DEATH AND STILL MORE VARIOUS THE FORMS IN WHICH IMAGINATION CLOTHES IT
FOR THIS ALTERNATION OF FEELING COMPARE THE OLD TESTAMENT PSALM VI
ISAIAH ECCLES
12
WHEN WE THINK OF GOD AND OF MAN IN HIS RELATION TO GOD OF THE
IMPERFECTION OF OUR PRESENT STATE AND YET OF THE PROGRESS WHICH IS
OBSERVABLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND OF THE HUMAN MIND OF THE
DEPTH AND POWER OF OUR MORAL IDEAS WHICH SEEM TO PARTAKE OF THE VERY
NATURE OF GOD HIMSELF WHEN WE CONSIDER THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE
PHYSICAL LAWS TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT AND THE HIGHER LAW WHICH RAISES US
ABOVE THEM AND IS YET A PART OF THEM WHEN WE REFLECT ON OUR CAPACITY OF
BECOMING THE 'SPECTATORS OF ALL TIME AND ALL EXISTENCE AND OF FRAMING
IN OUR OWN MINDS THE IDEAL OF A PERFECT BEING WHEN WE SEE HOW THE
HUMAN MIND IN ALL THE HIGHER RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD INCLUDING BUDDHISM
NOTWITHSTANDING SOME ABERRATIONS HAS TENDED TOWARDS SUCH A BELIEF WE
HAVE REASON TO THINK THAT OUR DESTINY IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ANIMALS
AND THOUGH WE CANNOT ALTOGETHER SHUT OUT THE CHILDISH FEAR THAT THE SOUL
UPON LEAVING THE BODY MAY 'VANISH INTO THIN AIR WE HAVE STILL SO FAR
AS THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT ADMITS A HOPE OF IMMORTALITY WITH WHICH WE
COMFORT OURSELVES ON SUFFICIENT GROUNDS
THE DENIAL OF THE BELIEF TAKES
THE HEART OUT OF HUMAN LIFE IT LOWERS MEN TO THE LEVEL OF THE MATERIAL
AS GOETHE ALSO SAYS 'HE IS DEAD EVEN IN THIS WORLD WHO HAS NO BELIEF IN
ANOTHER
13
IT IS WELL ALSO THAT WE SHOULD SOMETIMES THINK OF THE FORMS OF
THOUGHT UNDER WHICH THE IDEA OF IMMORTALITY IS MOST NATURALLY PRESENTED
TO US
IT IS CLEAR THAT TO OUR MINDS THE RISEN SOUL CAN NO LONGER BE
DESCRIBED AS IN A PICTURE BY THE SYMBOL OF A CREATURE HALF BIRD
HALF HUMAN NOR IN ANY OTHER FORM OF SENSE
THE MULTITUDE OF ANGELS AS
IN MILTON SINGING THE ALMIGHTY'S PRAISES ARE A NOBLE IMAGE AND MAY
FURNISH A THEME FOR THE POET OR THE PAINTER BUT THEY ARE NO LONGER AN
ADEQUATE EXPRESSION OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD WHICH IS WITHIN US
NEITHER IS
THERE ANY MANSION IN THIS WORLD OR ANOTHER IN WHICH THE DEPARTED CAN
BE IMAGINED TO DWELL AND CARRY ON THEIR OCCUPATIONS
WHEN THIS EARTHLY
TABERNACLE IS DISSOLVED NO OTHER HABITATION OR BUILDING CAN TAKE THEM
IN IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF IDEAS ONLY THAT WE SPEAK OF THEM
FIRST OF ALL THERE IS THE THOUGHT OF REST AND FREEDOM FROM PAIN THEY
HAVE GONE HOME AS THE COMMON SAYING IS AND THE CARES OF THIS WORLD
TOUCH THEM NO MORE
SECONDLY WE MAY IMAGINE THEM AS THEY WERE AT
THEIR BEST AND BRIGHTEST HUMBLY FULFILLING THEIR DAILY ROUND OF
DUTIES SELFLESS CHILDLIKE UNAFFECTED BY THE WORLD WHEN THE EYE WAS
SINGLE AND THE WHOLE BODY SEEMED TO BE FULL OF LIGHT WHEN THE MIND WAS
CLEAR AND SAW INTO THE PURPOSES OF GOD
THIRDLY WE MAY THINK OF THEM
AS POSSESSED BY A GREAT LOVE OF GOD AND MAN WORKING OUT HIS WILL AT A
FURTHER STAGE IN THE HEAVENLY PILGRIMAGE
AND YET WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THESE ARE THE THINGS WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD AND THEREFORE
IT HATH NOT ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN IN ANY SENSIBLE MANNER TO
CONCEIVE THEM
FOURTHLY THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME MOMENTS IN OUR OWN
LIVES WHEN WE HAVE RISEN ABOVE OURSELVES OR BEEN CONSCIOUS OF OUR TRUER
SELVES IN WHICH THE WILL OF GOD HAS SUPERSEDED OUR WILLS AND WE HAVE
ENTERED INTO COMMUNION WITH HIM AND BEEN PARTAKERS FOR A BRIEF SEASON
OF THE DIVINE TRUTH AND LOVE IN WHICH LIKE CHRIST WE HAVE BEEN INSPIRED
TO UTTER THE PRAYER 'I IN THEM AND THOU IN ME THAT WE MAY BE ALL MADE
PERFECT IN ONE THESE PRECIOUS MOMENTS IF WE HAVE EVER KNOWN THEM ARE
THE NEAREST APPROACH WHICH WE CAN MAKE TO THE IDEA OF IMMORTALITY
14
RETURNING NOW TO THE EARLIER STAGE OF HUMAN THOUGHT WHICH IS
REPRESENTED BY THE WRITINGS OF PLATO WE FIND THAT MANY OF THE
SAME QUESTIONS HAVE ALREADY ARISEN THERE IS THE SAME TENDENCY TO
MATERIALISM THE SAME INCONSISTENCY IN THE APPLICATION OF THE IDEA OF
MIND THE SAME DOUBT WHETHER THE SOUL IS TO BE REGARDED AS A CAUSE OR AS
AN EFFECT THE SAME FALLING BACK ON MORAL CONVICTIONS
IN THE PHAEDO THE
SOUL IS CONSCIOUS OF HER DIVINE NATURE AND THE SEPARATION FROM THE BODY
WHICH HAS BEEN COMMENCED IN THIS LIFE IS PERFECTED IN ANOTHER
BEGINNING
IN MYSTERY SOCRATES IN THE INTERMEDIATE PART OF THE DIALOGUE ATTEMPTS
TO BRING THE DOCTRINE OF A FUTURE LIFE INTO CONNECTION WITH HIS THEORY
OF KNOWLEDGE
IN PROPORTION AS HE SUCCEEDS IN THIS THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMS
TO DISAPPEAR IN A MORE GENERAL NOTION OF THE SOUL THE CONTEMPLATION OF
IDEAS 'UNDER THE FORM OF ETERNITY' TAKES THE PLACE OF PAST AND FUTURE
STATES OF EXISTENCE
HIS LANGUAGE MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF SOME MODERN
PHILOSOPHERS WHO SPEAK OF ETERNITY NOT IN THE SENSE OF PERPETUAL
DURATION OF TIME BUT AS AN EVER PRESENT QUALITY OF THE SOUL
YET AT
THE CONCLUSION OF THE DIALOGUE HAVING 'ARRIVED AT THE END OF THE
INTELLECTUAL WORLD' REPUBLIC HE REPLACES THE VEIL OF MYTHOLOGY
AND DESCRIBES THE SOUL AND HER ATTENDANT GENIUS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE
MYSTERIES OR OF A DISCIPLE OF ZOROASTER
NOR CAN WE FAIRLY DEMAND OF
PLATO A CONSISTENCY WHICH IS WANTING AMONG OURSELVES WHO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT ANOTHER WORLD IS BEYOND THE RANGE OF HUMAN THOUGHT AND YET ARE
ALWAYS SEEKING TO REPRESENT THE MANSIONS OF HEAVEN OR HELL IN
THE COLOURS OF THE PAINTER OR IN THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE POET OR
RHETORICIAN
15
THE DOCTRINE OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL WAS NOT NEW TO THE
GREEKS IN THE AGE OF SOCRATES BUT LIKE THE UNITY OF GOD HAD A
FOUNDATION IN THE POPULAR BELIEF
THE OLD HOMERIC NOTION OF A GIBBERING
GHOST FLITTING AWAY TO HADES OR OF A FEW ILLUSTRIOUS HEROES ENJOYING
THE ISLES OF THE BLEST OR OF AN EXISTENCE DIVIDED BETWEEN THE TWO OR
THE HESIODIC OF RIGHTEOUS SPIRITS WHO BECOME GUARDIAN ANGELS HAD
GIVEN PLACE IN THE MYSTERIES AND THE ORPHIC POETS TO REPRESENTATIONS
PARTLY FANCIFUL OF A FUTURE STATE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS
LAWS
THE RETICENCE OF THE GREEKS ON PUBLIC OCCASIONS AND IN SOME PART OF
THEIR LITERATURE RESPECTING THIS 'UNDERGROUND' RELIGION IS NOT TO BE
TAKEN AS A MEASURE OF THE DIFFUSION OF SUCH BELIEFS
IF PERICLES IN THE
FUNERAL ORATION IS SILENT ON THE CONSOLATIONS OF IMMORTALITY THE
POET PINDAR AND THE TRAGEDIANS ON THE OTHER HAND CONSTANTLY ASSUME THE
CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF THE DEAD IN AN UPPER OR UNDER WORLD
DARIUS
AND LAIUS ARE STILL ALIVE ANTIGONE WILL BE DEAR TO HER BRETHREN AFTER
DEATH THE WAY TO THE PALACE OF CRONOS IS FOUND BY THOSE WHO 'HAVE
THRICE DEPARTED FROM EVIL THE TRAGEDY OF THE GREEKS IS NOT 'ROUNDED'
BY THIS LIFE BUT IS DEEPLY SET IN DECREES OF FATE AND MYSTERIOUS
WORKINGS OF POWERS BENEATH THE EARTH
IN THE CARICATURE OF ARISTOPHANES
THERE IS ALSO A WITNESS TO THE COMMON SENTIMENT
THE IONIAN AND
PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHIES AROSE AND SOME NEW ELEMENTS WERE ADDED TO THE
POPULAR BELIEF
THE INDIVIDUAL MUST FIND AN EXPRESSION AS WELL AS THE
WORLD
EITHER THE SOUL WAS SUPPOSED TO EXIST IN THE FORM OF A MAGNET OR
OF A PARTICLE OF FIRE OR OF LIGHT OR AIR OR WATER OR OF A NUMBER OR
OF A HARMONY OF NUMBER OR TO BE OR HAVE LIKE THE STARS A PRINCIPLE
OF MOTION ARIST
DE ANIM
AT LENGTH ANAXAGORAS HARDLY DISTINGUISHING
BETWEEN LIFE AND MIND OR BETWEEN MIND HUMAN AND DIVINE ATTAINED
THE PURE ABSTRACTION AND THIS LIKE THE OTHER ABSTRACTIONS OF GREEK
PHILOSOPHY SANK DEEP INTO THE HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
THE OPPOSITION OF
THE INTELLIGIBLE AND THE SENSIBLE AND OF GOD TO THE WORLD SUPPLIED AN
ANALOGY WHICH ASSISTED IN THE SEPARATION OF SOUL AND BODY
IF IDEAS WERE
SEPARABLE FROM PHENOMENA MIND WAS ALSO SEPARABLE FROM MATTER IF THE
IDEAS WERE ETERNAL THE MIND THAT CONCEIVED THEM WAS ETERNAL TOO
AS
THE UNITY OF GOD WAS MORE DISTINCTLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE CONCEPTION OF THE
HUMAN SOUL BECAME MORE DEVELOPED
THE SUCCESSION OR ALTERNATION OF
LIFE AND DEATH HAD OCCURRED TO HERACLEITUS
THE ELEATIC PARMENIDES HAD
STUMBLED UPON THE MODERN THESIS THAT 'THOUGHT AND BEING ARE THE SAME
THE EASTERN BELIEF IN TRANSMIGRATION DEFINED THE SENSE OF INDIVIDUALITY
AND SOME LIKE EMPEDOCLES FANCIED THAT THE BLOOD WHICH THEY HAD SHED
IN ANOTHER STATE OF BEING WAS CRYING AGAINST THEM AND THAT FOR THIRTY
THOUSAND YEARS THEY WERE TO BE 'FUGITIVES AND VAGABONDS UPON THE EARTH
THE DESIRE OF RECOGNIZING A LOST MOTHER OR LOVE OR FRIEND IN THE WORLD
BELOW PHAEDO WAS A NATURAL FEELING WHICH IN THAT AGE AS WELL AS IN
EVERY OTHER HAS GIVEN DISTINCTNESS TO THE HOPE OF IMMORTALITY
NOR WERE
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS WANTING PARTLY DERIVED FROM THE NECESSITY OF
PUNISHING THE GREATER SORT OF CRIMINALS WHOM NO AVENGING POWER OF THIS
WORLD COULD REACH
THE VOICE OF CONSCIENCE TOO WAS HEARD REMINDING
THE GOOD MAN THAT HE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER INNOCENT
REPUBLIC TO THESE
INDISTINCT LONGINGS AND FEARS AN EXPRESSION WAS GIVEN IN THE MYSTERIES
AND ORPHIC POETS A 'HEAP OF BOOKS' REPUBLIC PASSING UNDER THE NAMES
OF MUSAEUS AND ORPHEUS IN PLATO'S TIME WERE FILLED WITH NOTIONS OF AN
UNDER WORLD
16
YET AFTER ALL THE BELIEF IN THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE SOUL AFTER
DEATH HAD BUT A FEEBLE HOLD ON THE GREEK MIND
LIKE THE PERSONALITY OF
GOD THE PERSONALITY OF MAN IN A FUTURE STATE WAS NOT INSEPARABLY BOUND
UP WITH THE REALITY OF HIS EXISTENCE
FOR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE
PERSONAL AND IMPERSONAL AND ALSO BETWEEN THE DIVINE AND HUMAN WAS FAR
LESS MARKED TO THE GREEK THAN TO OURSELVES
AND AS PLATO READILY PASSES
FROM THE NOTION OF THE GOOD TO THAT OF GOD HE ALSO PASSES ALMOST
IMPERCEPTIBLY TO HIMSELF AND HIS READER FROM THE FUTURE LIFE OF THE
INDIVIDUAL SOUL TO THE ETERNAL BEING OF THE ABSOLUTE SOUL
THERE HAS
BEEN A CLEARER STATEMENT AND A CLEARER DENIAL OF THE BELIEF IN MODERN
TIMES THAN IS FOUND IN EARLY GREEK PHILOSOPHY AND HENCE THE COMPARATIVE
SILENCE ON THE WHOLE SUBJECT WHICH IS OFTEN REMARKED IN ANCIENT WRITERS
AND PARTICULARLY IN ARISTOTLE
FOR PLATO AND ARISTOTLE ARE NOT FURTHER
REMOVED IN THEIR TEACHING ABOUT THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL THAN THEY
ARE IN THEIR THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
17
LIVING IN AN AGE WHEN LOGIC WAS BEGINNING TO MOULD HUMAN THOUGHT
PLATO NATURALLY CAST HIS BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY INTO A LOGICAL FORM
AND
WHEN WE CONSIDER HOW MUCH THE DOCTRINE OF IDEAS WAS ALSO ONE OF WORDS
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO VERBAL FALLACIES
EARLY LOGIC IS ALWAYS MISTAKING THE TRUTH OF THE FORM FOR THE TRUTH OF
THE MATTER
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THE ALTERNATION OF OPPOSITES IS
NOT THE SAME AS THE GENERATION OF THEM OUT OF EACH OTHER AND THAT THE
GENERATION OF THEM OUT OF EACH OTHER WHICH IS THE FIRST ARGUMENT IN
THE PHAEDO IS AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR MUTUAL EXCLUSION OF EACH OTHER
WHETHER IN THEMSELVES OR IN US WHICH IS THE LAST
FOR EVEN IF WE ADMIT
THE DISTINCTION WHICH HE DRAWS BETWEEN THE OPPOSITES AND THE THINGS
WHICH HAVE THE OPPOSITES STILL INDIVIDUALS FALL UNDER THE LATTER CLASS
AND WE HAVE TO PASS OUT OF THE REGION OF HUMAN HOPES AND FEARS TO A
CONCEPTION OF AN ABSTRACT SOUL WHICH IS THE IMPERSONATION OF THE IDEAS
SUCH A CONCEPTION WHICH IN PLATO HIMSELF IS BUT HALF EXPRESSED IS
UNMEANING TO US AND RELATIVE ONLY TO A PARTICULAR STAGE IN THE HISTORY
OF THOUGHT
THE DOCTRINE OF REMINISCENCE IS ALSO A FRAGMENT OF A FORMER
WORLD WHICH HAS NO PLACE IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF MODERN TIMES
BUT PLATO
HAD THE WONDERS OF PSYCHOLOGY JUST OPENING TO HIM AND HE HAD NOT THE
EXPLANATION OF THEM WHICH IS SUPPLIED BY THE ANALYSIS OF LANGUAGE AND
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN MIND
THE QUESTION 'WHENCE COME OUR ABSTRACT
IDEAS HE COULD ONLY ANSWER BY AN IMAGINARY HYPOTHESIS
NOR IS IT
DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT HIS CROWNING ARGUMENT IS PURELY VERBAL AND IS
BUT THE EXPRESSION OF AN INSTINCTIVE CONFIDENCE PUT INTO A LOGICAL
FORM 'THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL BECAUSE IT CONTAINS A PRINCIPLE OF
IMPERISHABLENESS NOR DOES HE HIMSELF SEEM AT ALL TO BE AWARE THAT
NOTHING IS ADDED TO HUMAN KNOWLEDGE BY HIS 'SAFE AND SIMPLE ANSWER
THAT BEAUTY IS THE CAUSE OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND THAT HE IS MERELY
REASSERTING THE ELEATIC BEING 'DIVIDED BY THE PYTHAGOREAN NUMBERS
AGAINST THE HERACLEITEAN DOCTRINE OF PERPETUAL GENERATION
THE ANSWER TO
THE 'VERY SERIOUS QUESTION' OF GENERATION AND DESTRUCTION IS REALLY
THE DENIAL OF THEM
FOR THIS HE WOULD SUBSTITUTE AS IN THE REPUBLIC A
SYSTEM OF IDEAS TESTED NOT BY EXPERIENCE BUT BY THEIR CONSEQUENCES
AND NOT EXPLAINED BY ACTUAL CAUSES BUT BY A HIGHER THAT IS A MORE
GENERAL NOTION
CONSISTENCY WITH THEMSELVES IS THE ONLY TEST WHICH IS TO
BE APPLIED TO THEM
REPUBLIC AND PHAEDO
18
TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH SUCH ARGUMENTS THEY SHOULD BE TRANSLATED AS
FAR AS POSSIBLE INTO THEIR MODERN EQUIVALENTS
'IF THE IDEAS OF MEN ARE
ETERNAL THEIR SOULS ARE ETERNAL AND IF NOT THE IDEAS THEN NOT THE
SOULS SUCH AN ARGUMENT STANDS NEARLY IN THE SAME RELATION TO PLATO AND
HIS AGE AS THE ARGUMENT FROM THE EXISTENCE OF GOD TO IMMORTALITY AMONG
OURSELVES
'IF GOD EXISTS THEN THE SOUL EXISTS AFTER DEATH AND IF
THERE IS NO GOD THERE IS NO EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH FOR
THE IDEAS ARE TO HIS MIND THE REALITY THE TRUTH THE PRINCIPLE OF
PERMANENCE AS WELL AS OF INTELLIGENCE AND ORDER IN THE WORLD
WHEN
SIMMIAS AND CEBES SAY THAT THEY ARE MORE STRONGLY PERSUADED OF THE
EXISTENCE OF IDEAS THAN THEY ARE OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL THEY
REPRESENT FAIRLY ENOUGH THE ORDER OF THOUGHT IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY
AND WE
MIGHT SAY IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE ARE MORE CERTAIN OF THE EXISTENCE
OF GOD THAN WE ARE OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AND ARE LED BY THE
BELIEF IN THE ONE TO A BELIEF IN THE OTHER
THE PARALLEL AS SOCRATES
WOULD SAY IS NOT PERFECT BUT AGREES IN AS FAR AS THE MIND IN EITHER
CASE IS REGARDED AS DEPENDENT ON SOMETHING ABOVE AND BEYOND HERSELF
THE
ANALOGY MAY EVEN BE PRESSED A STEP FURTHER 'WE ARE MORE CERTAIN OF OUR
IDEAS OF TRUTH AND RIGHT THAN WE ARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND
ARE LED ON IN THE ORDER OF THOUGHT FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OR MORE
CORRECTLY 'THE EXISTENCE OF RIGHT AND TRUTH IS THE EXISTENCE OF GOD
AND CAN NEVER FOR A MOMENT BE SEPARATED FROM HIM
19
THE MAIN ARGUMENT OF THE PHAEDO IS DERIVED FROM THE EXISTENCE OF
ETERNAL IDEAS OF WHICH THE SOUL IS A PARTAKER THE OTHER ARGUMENT OF THE
ALTERNATION OF OPPOSITES IS REPLACED BY THIS
AND THERE HAVE NOT BEEN
WANTING PHILOSOPHERS OF THE IDEALIST SCHOOL WHO HAVE IMAGINED THAT THE
DOCTRINE OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IS A THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE AND
THAT IN WHAT HAS PRECEDED PLATO IS ACCOMMODATING HIMSELF TO THE POPULAR
BELIEF
SUCH A VIEW CAN ONLY BE ELICITED FROM THE PHAEDO BY WHAT MAY
BE TERMED THE TRANSCENDENTAL METHOD OF INTERPRETATION AND IS OBVIOUSLY
INCONSISTENT WITH THE GORGIAS AND THE REPUBLIC
THOSE WHO MAINTAIN
IT ARE IMMEDIATELY COMPELLED TO RENOUNCE THE SHADOW WHICH THEY HAVE
GRASPED AS A PLAY OF WORDS ONLY
BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT PLATO IN HIS
ARGUMENT FOR THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL HAS COLLECTED MANY ELEMENTS OF
PROOF OR PERSUASION ETHICAL AND MYTHOLOGICAL AS WELL AS DIALECTICAL
WHICH ARE NOT EASILY TO BE RECONCILED WITH ONE ANOTHER AND HE IS AS
MUCH IN EARNEST ABOUT HIS DOCTRINE OF RETRIBUTION WHICH IS REPEATED
IN ALL HIS MORE ETHICAL WRITINGS AS ABOUT HIS THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
AND WHILE WE MAY FAIRLY TRANSLATE THE DIALECTICAL INTO THE LANGUAGE OF
HEGEL AND THE RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL INTO THE LANGUAGE OF DANTE OR
BUNYAN THE ETHICAL SPEAKS TO US STILL IN THE SAME VOICE AND APPEALS TO
A COMMON FEELING
20
TWO ARGUMENTS OF THIS ETHICAL CHARACTER OCCUR IN THE PHAEDO
THE
FIRST MAY BE DESCRIBED AS THE ASPIRATION OF THE SOUL AFTER ANOTHER STATE
OF BEING
LIKE THE ORIENTAL OR CHRISTIAN MYSTIC THE PHILOSOPHER IS
SEEKING TO WITHDRAW FROM IMPURITIES OF SENSE TO LEAVE THE WORLD AND THE
THINGS OF THE WORLD AND TO FIND HIS HIGHER SELF
PLATO RECOGNIZES IN
THESE ASPIRATIONS THE FORETASTE OF IMMORTALITY AS BUTLER AND ADDISON IN
MODERN TIMES HAVE ARGUED THE ONE FROM THE MORAL TENDENCIES OF MANKIND
THE OTHER FROM THE PROGRESS OF THE SOUL TOWARDS PERFECTION
IN USING
THIS ARGUMENT PLATO HAS CERTAINLY CONFUSED THE SOUL WHICH HAS LEFT THE
BODY WITH THE SOUL OF THE GOOD AND WISE
COMPARE REPUBLIC SUCH A
CONFUSION WAS NATURAL AND AROSE PARTLY OUT OF THE ANTITHESIS OF SOUL
AND BODY
THE SOUL IN HER OWN ESSENCE AND THE SOUL 'CLOTHED UPON' WITH
VIRTUES AND GRACES WERE EASILY INTERCHANGED WITH ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE
ON A SUBJECT WHICH PASSES EXPRESSION THE DISTINCTIONS OF LANGUAGE CAN
HARDLY BE MAINTAINED
21
THE ETHICAL PROOF OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IS DERIVED FROM THE
NECESSITY OF RETRIBUTION
THE WICKED WOULD BE TOO WELL OFF IF THEIR
EVIL DEEDS CAME TO AN END
IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT AN ARDIAEUS
AN ARCHELAUS AN ISMENIAS COULD EVER HAVE SUFFERED THE PENALTY OF
THEIR CRIMES IN THIS WORLD
THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS RETRIBUTION IS
ACCOMPLISHED PLATO REPRESENTS UNDER THE FIGURES OF MYTHOLOGY
DOUBTLESS
HE FELT THAT IT WAS EASIER TO IMPROVE THAN TO INVENT AND THAT IN
RELIGION ESPECIALLY THE TRADITIONAL FORM WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GIVE
VERISIMILITUDE TO THE MYTH
THE MYTH TOO IS FAR MORE PROBABLE TO THAT
AGE THAN TO OURS AND MAY FAIRLY BE REGARDED AS 'ONE GUESS AMONG
MANY' ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE EARTH WHICH HE CLEVERLY SUPPORTS BY THE
INDICATIONS OF GEOLOGY
NOT THAT HE INSISTS ON THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH OF
HIS OWN PARTICULAR NOTIONS 'NO MAN OF SENSE WILL BE CONFIDENT IN SUCH
MATTERS BUT HE WILL BE CONFIDENT THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND IS TRUE
AS IN OTHER PASSAGES GORG TIM COMPARE CRITO HE WINS BELIEF FOR
HIS FICTIONS BY THE MODERATION OF HIS STATEMENTS HE DOES NOT LIKE
DANTE OR SWEDENBORG ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE DECEIVED BY HIS OWN CREATIONS
THE DIALOGUE MUST BE READ IN THE LIGHT OF THE SITUATION
AND FIRST OF
ALL WE ARE STRUCK BY THE CALMNESS OF THE SCENE
LIKE THE SPECTATORS
AT THE TIME WE CANNOT PITY SOCRATES HIS MIEN AND HIS LANGUAGE ARE
SO NOBLE AND FEARLESS
HE IS THE SAME THAT HE EVER WAS BUT MILDER AND
GENTLER AND HE HAS IN NO DEGREE LOST HIS INTEREST IN DIALECTICS
HE WILL NOT FOREGO THE DELIGHT OF AN ARGUMENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE
JAILER'S INTIMATION THAT HE SHOULD NOT HEAT HIMSELF WITH TALKING
AT
SUCH A TIME HE NATURALLY EXPRESSES THE HOPE OF HIS LIFE THAT HE HAS
BEEN A TRUE MYSTIC AND NOT A MERE RETAINER OR WAND BEARER AND HE REFERS
TO PASSAGES OF HIS PERSONAL HISTORY
TO HIS OLD ENEMIES THE COMIC
POETS AND TO THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE TRIAL HE ALLUDES PLAYFULLY BUT HE
VIVIDLY REMEMBERS THE DISAPPOINTMENT WHICH HE FELT IN READING THE BOOKS
OF ANAXAGORAS
THE RETURN OF XANTHIPPE AND HIS CHILDREN INDICATES THAT
THE PHILOSOPHER IS NOT 'MADE OF OAK OR ROCK SOME OTHER TRAITS OF HIS
CHARACTER MAY BE NOTED FOR EXAMPLE THE COURTEOUS MANNER IN WHICH
HE INCLINES HIS HEAD TO THE LAST OBJECTOR OR THE IRONICAL TOUCH 'ME
ALREADY AS THE TRAGIC POET WOULD SAY THE VOICE OF FATE CALLS OR
THE DEPRECIATION OF THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH 'HE COMFORTED HIMSELF AND
THEM OR HIS FEAR OF 'MISOLOGY OR HIS REFERENCES TO HOMER OR THE
PLAYFUL SMILE WITH WHICH HE 'TALKS LIKE A BOOK' ABOUT GREATER AND LESS
OR THE ALLUSION TO THE POSSIBILITY OF FINDING ANOTHER TEACHER AMONG
BARBAROUS RACES COMPARE POLIT OR THE MYSTERIOUS REFERENCE TO ANOTHER
SCIENCE MATHEMATICS OF GENERATION AND DESTRUCTION FOR WHICH HE IS
VAINLY FEELING
THERE IS NO CHANGE IN HIM ONLY NOW HE IS INVESTED WITH
A SORT OF SACRED CHARACTER AS THE PROPHET OR PRIEST OF APOLLO THE GOD
OF THE FESTIVAL IN WHOSE HONOUR HE FIRST OF ALL COMPOSES A HYMN
AND THEN LIKE THE SWAN POURS FORTH HIS DYING LAY
PERHAPS THE EXTREME
ELEVATION OF SOCRATES ABOVE HIS OWN SITUATION AND THE ORDINARY
INTERESTS OF LIFE COMPARE HIS JEU D'ESPRIT ABOUT HIS BURIAL IN WHICH
FOR A MOMENT HE PUTS ON THE 'SILENUS MASK' CREATE IN THE MIND OF THE
READER AN IMPRESSION STRONGER THAN COULD BE DERIVED FROM ARGUMENTS THAT
SUCH A ONE HAS IN HIM 'A PRINCIPLE WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF DEATH
THE OTHER PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE MAY BE CONSIDERED UNDER TWO HEADS 1
PRIVATE FRIENDS 2 THE RESPONDENTS IN THE ARGUMENT
FIRST THERE IS CRITO WHO HAS BEEN ALREADY INTRODUCED TO US IN THE
EUTHYDEMUS AND THE CRITO HE IS THE EQUAL IN YEARS OF SOCRATES AND
STANDS IN QUITE A DIFFERENT RELATION TO HIM FROM HIS YOUNGER DISCIPLES
HE IS A MAN OF THE WORLD WHO IS RICH AND PROSPEROUS COMPARE THE JEST
IN THE EUTHYDEMUS THE BEST FRIEND OF SOCRATES WHO WANTS TO KNOW HIS
COMMANDS IN WHOSE PRESENCE HE TALKS TO HIS FAMILY AND WHO PERFORMS
THE LAST DUTY OF CLOSING HIS EYES
IT IS OBSERVABLE TOO THAT AS IN THE
EUTHYDEMUS CRITO SHOWS NO APTITUDE FOR PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSIONS
NOR
AMONG THE FRIENDS OF SOCRATES MUST THE JAILER BE FORGOTTEN WHO SEEMS
TO HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED BY PLATO IN ORDER TO SHOW THE IMPRESSION MADE
BY THE EXTRAORDINARY MAN ON THE COMMON
THE GENTLE NATURE OF THE MAN
IS INDICATED BY HIS WEEPING AT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS ERRAND AND THEN
TURNING AWAY AND ALSO BY THE WORDS OF SOCRATES TO HIS DISCIPLES 'HOW
CHARMING THE MAN IS SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN PRISON HE HAS BEEN ALWAYS
COMING TO ME AND IS AS GOOD AS COULD BE TO ME WE ARE REMINDED
TOO THAT HE HAS RETAINED THIS GENTLE NATURE AMID SCENES OF DEATH AND
VIOLENCE BY THE CONTRASTS WHICH HE DRAWS BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOUR OF
SOCRATES AND OF OTHERS WHEN ABOUT TO DIE
ANOTHER PERSON WHO TAKES NO PART IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION IS THE
EXCITABLE APOLLODORUS THE SAME WHO IN THE SYMPOSIUM OF WHICH HE IS
THE NARRATOR IS CALLED 'THE MADMAN AND WHO TESTIFIES HIS GRIEF BY THE
MOST VIOLENT EMOTIONS
PHAEDO IS ALSO PRESENT THE 'BELOVED DISCIPLE'
AS HE MAY BE TERMED WHO IS DESCRIBED IF NOT 'LEANING ON HIS BOSOM
AS SEATED NEXT TO SOCRATES WHO IS PLAYING WITH HIS HAIR
HE TOO LIKE
APOLLODORUS TAKES NO PART IN THE DISCUSSION BUT HE LOVES ABOVE ALL
THINGS TO HEAR AND SPEAK OF SOCRATES AFTER HIS DEATH
THE CALMNESS
OF HIS BEHAVIOUR VEILING HIS FACE WHEN HE CAN NO LONGER RESTRAIN
HIS TEARS CONTRASTS WITH THE PASSIONATE OUTCRIES OF THE OTHER
AT A
PARTICULAR POINT THE ARGUMENT IS DESCRIBED AS FALLING BEFORE THE ATTACK
OF SIMMIAS
A SORT OF DESPAIR IS INTRODUCED IN THE MINDS OF THE COMPANY
THE EFFECT OF THIS IS HEIGHTENED BY THE DESCRIPTION OF PHAEDO WHO HAS
BEEN THE EYE WITNESS OF THE SCENE AND BY THE SYMPATHY OF HIS PHLIASIAN
AUDITORS WHO ARE BEGINNING TO THINK 'THAT THEY TOO CAN NEVER TRUST AN
ARGUMENT AGAIN AND THE INTENSE INTEREST OF THE COMPANY IS COMMUNICATED
NOT ONLY TO THE FIRST AUDITORS BUT TO US WHO IN A DISTANT COUNTRY READ
THE NARRATIVE OF THEIR EMOTIONS AFTER MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS HAVE
PASSED AWAY
THE TWO PRINCIPAL INTERLOCUTORS ARE SIMMIAS AND CEBES THE DISCIPLES OF
PHILOLAUS THE PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHER OF THEBES
SIMMIAS IS DESCRIBED
IN THE PHAEDRUS AS FONDER OF AN ARGUMENT THAN ANY MAN LIVING AND
CEBES ALTHOUGH FINALLY PERSUADED BY SOCRATES IS SAID TO BE THE MOST
INCREDULOUS OF HUMAN BEINGS
IT IS CEBES WHO AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF
THE DIALOGUE ASKS WHY 'SUICIDE IS HELD TO BE UNLAWFUL AND WHO
FIRST SUPPLIES THE DOCTRINE OF RECOLLECTION IN CONFIRMATION OF THE
PRE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL
IT IS CEBES WHO URGES THAT THE PRE EXISTENCE
DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE THE FUTURE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL AS IS
SHOWN BY THE ILLUSTRATION OF THE WEAVER AND HIS COAT
SIMMIAS ON THE
OTHER HAND RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT HARMONY AND THE LYRE WHICH IS
NATURALLY PUT INTO THE MOUTH OF A PYTHAGOREAN DISCIPLE
IT IS SIMMIAS
TOO WHO FIRST REMARKS ON THE UNCERTAINTY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE AND
ONLY AT LAST CONCEDES TO THE ARGUMENT SUCH A QUALIFIED APPROVAL AS IS
CONSISTENT WITH THE FEEBLENESS OF THE HUMAN FACULTIES
CEBES IS THE
DEEPER AND MORE CONSECUTIVE THINKER SIMMIAS MORE SUPERFICIAL AND
RHETORICAL THEY ARE DISTINGUISHED IN MUCH THE SAME MANNER AS ADEIMANTUS
AND GLAUCON IN THE REPUBLIC
OTHER PERSONS MENEXENUS CTESIPPUS LYSIS ARE OLD FRIENDS EVENUS
HAS BEEN ALREADY SATIRIZED IN THE APOLOGY AESCHINES AND EPIGENES
WERE PRESENT AT THE TRIAL EUCLID AND TERPSION WILL REAPPEAR IN THE
INTRODUCTION TO THE THEAETETUS HERMOGENES HAS ALREADY APPEARED IN
THE CRATYLUS
NO INFERENCE CAN FAIRLY BE DRAWN FROM THE ABSENCE OF
ARISTIPPUS NOR FROM THE OMISSION OF XENOPHON WHO AT THE TIME OF
SOCRATES' DEATH WAS IN ASIA
THE MENTION OF PLATO'S OWN ABSENCE SEEMS
LIKE AN EXPRESSION OF SORROW AND MAY PERHAPS BE AN INDICATION THAT
THE REPORT OF THE CONVERSATION IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY
THE PLACE OF THE DIALOGUE IN THE SERIES IS DOUBTFUL
THE DOCTRINE OF
IDEAS IS CERTAINLY CARRIED BEYOND THE SOCRATIC POINT OF VIEW IN NO
OTHER OF THE WRITINGS OF PLATO IS THE THEORY OF THEM SO COMPLETELY
DEVELOPED
WHETHER THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO
SOCRATES OR NOT IS UNCERTAIN THE SILENCE OF THE MEMORABILIA AND OF THE
EARLIER DIALOGUES OF PLATO IS AN ARGUMENT TO THE CONTRARY
YET IN THE
CYROPAEDIA XENOPHON HAS PUT LANGUAGE INTO THE MOUTH OF THE DYING CYRUS
WHICH RECALLS THE PHAEDO AND MAY HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM THE TEACHING OF
SOCRATES
IT MAY BE FAIRLY URGED THAT THE GREATEST RELIGIOUS INTEREST OF
MANKIND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WHOLLY IGNORED BY ONE WHO PASSED HIS LIFE IN
FULFILLING THE COMMANDS OF AN ORACLE AND WHO RECOGNIZED A DIVINE PLAN
IN MAN AND NATURE
XEN
MEM AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE APOLOGY AND OF
THE CRITO CONFIRMS THIS VIEW
THE PHAEDO IS NOT ONE OF THE SOCRATIC DIALOGUES OF PLATO NOR ON THE
OTHER HAND CAN IT BE ASSIGNED TO THAT LATER STAGE OF THE PLATONIC
WRITINGS AT WHICH THE DOCTRINE OF IDEAS APPEARS TO BE FORGOTTEN
IT
BELONGS RATHER TO THE INTERMEDIATE PERIOD OF THE PLATONIC PHILOSOPHY
WHICH ROUGHLY CORRESPONDS TO THE PHAEDRUS GORGIAS REPUBLIC
THEAETETUS
WITHOUT PRETENDING TO DETERMINE THE REAL TIME OF THEIR
COMPOSITION THE SYMPOSIUM MENO EUTHYPHRO APOLOGY PHAEDO MAY BE
CONVENIENTLY READ BY US IN THIS ORDER AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF
SOCRATES
ANOTHER CHAIN MAY BE FORMED OF THE MENO PHAEDRUS PHAEDO
IN WHICH THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IS CONNECTED WITH THE DOCTRINE OF
IDEAS
IN THE MENO THE THEORY OF IDEAS IS BASED ON THE ANCIENT BELIEF IN
TRANSMIGRATION WHICH REAPPEARS AGAIN IN THE PHAEDRUS AS WELL AS IN THE
REPUBLIC AND TIMAEUS AND IN ALL OF THEM IS CONNECTED WITH A DOCTRINE OF
RETRIBUTION
IN THE PHAEDRUS THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL IS SUPPOSED TO
REST ON THE CONCEPTION OF THE SOUL AS A PRINCIPLE OF MOTION WHEREAS IN
THE REPUBLIC THE ARGUMENT TURNS ON THE NATURAL CONTINUANCE OF THE SOUL
WHICH IF NOT DESTROYED BY HER OWN PROPER EVIL CAN HARDLY BE DESTROYED
BY ANY OTHER
THE SOUL OF MAN IN THE TIMAEUS IS DERIVED FROM THE SUPREME
CREATOR AND EITHER RETURNS AFTER DEATH TO HER KINDRED STAR OR DESCENDS
INTO THE LOWER LIFE OF AN ANIMAL
THE APOLOGY EXPRESSES THE SAME VIEW
AS THE PHAEDO BUT WITH LESS CONFIDENCE THERE THE PROBABILITY OF DEATH
BEING A LONG SLEEP IS NOT EXCLUDED
THE THEAETETUS ALSO DESCRIBES IN A
DIGRESSION THE DESIRE OF THE SOUL TO FLY AWAY AND BE WITH GOD 'AND TO
FLY TO HIM IS TO BE LIKE HIM THE SYMPOSIUM MAY BE OBSERVED TO
RESEMBLE AS WELL AS TO DIFFER FROM THE PHAEDO
WHILE THE FIRST NOTION OF
IMMORTALITY IS ONLY IN THE WAY OF NATURAL PROCREATION OR OF POSTHUMOUS
FAME AND GLORY THE HIGHER REVELATION OF BEAUTY LIKE THE GOOD IN THE
REPUBLIC IS THE VISION OF THE ETERNAL IDEA
SO DEEPLY ROOTED IN
PLATO'S MIND IS THE BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY SO VARIOUS ARE THE FORMS OF
EXPRESSION WHICH HE EMPLOYS
AS IN SEVERAL OTHER DIALOGUES THERE IS MORE OF SYSTEM IN THE PHAEDO
THAN APPEARS AT FIRST SIGHT
THE SUCCESSION OF ARGUMENTS IS BASED ON
PREVIOUS PHILOSOPHIES BEGINNING WITH THE MYSTERIES AND THE HERACLEITEAN
ALTERNATION OF OPPOSITES AND PROCEEDING TO THE PYTHAGOREAN HARMONY AND
TRANSMIGRATION MAKING A STEP BY THE AID OF PLATONIC REMINISCENCE AND
A FURTHER STEP BY THE HELP OF THE NOUS OF ANAXAGORAS UNTIL AT LAST WE
REST IN THE CONVICTION THAT THE SOUL IS INSEPARABLE FROM THE IDEAS
AND BELONGS TO THE WORLD OF THE INVISIBLE AND UNKNOWN
THEN AS IN
THE GORGIAS OR REPUBLIC THE CURTAIN FALLS AND THE VEIL OF MYTHOLOGY
DESCENDS UPON THE ARGUMENT
AFTER THE CONFESSION OF SOCRATES THAT HE IS
AN INTERESTED PARTY AND THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL
THINK THE DETAILS OF HIS NARRATIVE TRUE BUT THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND
IS TRUE WE RETURN FROM SPECULATION TO PRACTICE
HE IS HIMSELF MORE
CONFIDENT OF IMMORTALITY THAN HE IS OF HIS OWN ARGUMENTS AND THE
CONFIDENCE WHICH HE EXPRESSES IS LESS STRONG THAN THAT WHICH HIS
CHEERFULNESS AND COMPOSURE IN DEATH INSPIRE IN US
DIFFICULTIES OF TWO KINDS OCCUR IN THE PHAEDO ONE KIND TO BE EXPLAINED
OUT OF CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY THE OTHER NOT ADMITTING OF AN ENTIRE
SOLUTION
1 THE DIFFICULTY WHICH SOCRATES SAYS THAT HE EXPERIENCED IN
EXPLAINING GENERATION AND CORRUPTION THE ASSUMPTION OF HYPOTHESES WHICH
PROCEED FROM THE LESS GENERAL TO THE MORE GENERAL AND ARE TESTED BY
THEIR CONSEQUENCES THE PUZZLE ABOUT GREATER AND LESS THE RESORT TO THE
METHOD OF IDEAS WHICH TO US APPEAR ONLY ABSTRACT TERMS THESE ARE TO
BE EXPLAINED OUT OF THE POSITION OF SOCRATES AND PLATO IN THE HISTORY OF
PHILOSOPHY
THEY WERE LIVING IN A TWILIGHT BETWEEN THE SENSIBLE AND
THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD AND SAW NO WAY OF CONNECTING THEM
THEY
COULD NEITHER EXPLAIN THE RELATION OF IDEAS TO PHENOMENA NOR THEIR
CORRELATION TO ONE ANOTHER
THE VERY IDEA OF RELATION OR COMPARISON WAS
EMBARRASSING TO THEM
YET IN THIS INTELLECTUAL UNCERTAINTY THEY HAD A
CONCEPTION OF A PROOF FROM RESULTS AND OF A MORAL TRUTH WHICH REMAINED
UNSHAKEN AMID THE QUESTIONINGS OF PHILOSOPHY
2 THE OTHER IS A
DIFFICULTY WHICH IS TOUCHED UPON IN THE REPUBLIC AS WELL AS IN THE
PHAEDO AND IS COMMON TO MODERN AND ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY
PLATO IS NOT
ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH HIS SAFE AND SIMPLE METHOD OF IDEAS
HE WANTS
TO HAVE PROVED TO HIM BY FACTS THAT ALL THINGS ARE FOR THE BEST AND
THAT THERE IS ONE MIND OR DESIGN WHICH PERVADES THEM ALL
BUT THIS
'POWER OF THE BEST' HE IS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN AND THEREFORE TAKES REFUGE
IN UNIVERSAL IDEAS
AND ARE NOT WE AT THIS DAY SEEKING TO DISCOVER THAT
WHICH SOCRATES IN A GLASS DARKLY FORESAW
SOME RESEMBLANCES TO THE GREEK DRAMA MAY BE NOTED IN ALL THE DIALOGUES
OF PLATO
THE PHAEDO IS THE TRAGEDY OF WHICH SOCRATES IS THE PROTAGONIST
AND SIMMIAS AND CEBES THE SECONDARY PERFORMERS STANDING TO THEM IN THE
SAME RELATION AS TO GLAUCON AND ADEIMANTUS IN THE REPUBLIC
NO DIALOGUE
HAS A GREATER UNITY OF SUBJECT AND FEELING
PLATO HAS CERTAINLY
FULFILLED THE CONDITION OF GREEK OR RATHER OF ALL ART WHICH REQUIRES
THAT SCENES OF DEATH AND SUFFERING SHOULD BE CLOTHED IN BEAUTY
THE
GATHERING OF THE FRIENDS AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DIALOGUE THE
DISMISSAL OF XANTHIPPE WHOSE PRESENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF PLACE AT
A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION BUT WHO RETURNS AGAIN WITH HER CHILDREN TO
TAKE A FINAL FAREWELL THE DEJECTION OF THE AUDIENCE AT THE TEMPORARY
OVERTHROW OF THE ARGUMENT THE PICTURE OF SOCRATES PLAYING WITH THE
HAIR OF PHAEDO THE FINAL SCENE IN WHICH SOCRATES ALONE RETAINS HIS
COMPOSURE ARE MASTERPIECES OF ART
AND THE CHORUS AT THE END MIGHT HAVE
INTERPRETED THE FEELING OF THE PLAY 'THERE CAN NO EVIL HAPPEN TO A GOOD
MAN IN LIFE OR DEATH
'THE ART OF CONCEALING ART' IS NOWHERE MORE PERFECT THAN IN THOSE
WRITINGS OF PLATO WHICH DESCRIBE THE TRIAL AND DEATH OF SOCRATES
THEIR
CHARM IS THEIR SIMPLICITY WHICH GIVES THEM VERISIMILITUDE AND YET
THEY TOUCH AS IF INCIDENTALLY AND BECAUSE THEY WERE SUITABLE TO THE
OCCASION ON SOME OF THE DEEPEST TRUTHS OF PHILOSOPHY
THERE IS NOTHING
IN ANY TRAGEDY ANCIENT OR MODERN NOTHING IN POETRY OR HISTORY WITH
ONE EXCEPTION LIKE THE LAST HOURS OF SOCRATES IN PLATO
THE MASTER
COULD NOT BE MORE FITLY OCCUPIED AT SUCH A TIME THAN IN DISCOURSING OF
IMMORTALITY NOR THE DISCIPLES MORE DIVINELY CONSOLED
THE ARGUMENTS
TAKEN IN THE SPIRIT AND NOT IN THE LETTER ARE OUR ARGUMENTS AND
SOCRATES BY ANTICIPATION MAY BE EVEN THOUGHT TO REFUTE SOME 'ECCENTRIC
NOTIONS CURRENT IN OUR OWN AGE
FOR THERE ARE PHILOSOPHERS AMONG
OURSELVES WHO DO NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH STRONGER IS THE POWER
OF INTELLIGENCE OR OF THE BEST THAN OF ATLAS OR MECHANICAL FORCE
HOW FAR THE WORDS ATTRIBUTED TO SOCRATES WERE ACTUALLY UTTERED BY HIM WE
FORBEAR TO ASK FOR NO ANSWER CAN BE GIVEN TO THIS QUESTION
AND IT
IS BETTER TO RESIGN OURSELVES TO THE FEELING OF A GREAT WORK THAN TO
LINGER AMONG CRITICAL UNCERTAINTIES
PHAEDO
PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE
PHAEDO WHO IS THE NARRATOR OF THE DIALOGUE TO ECHECRATES OF PHLIUS
SOCRATES APOLLODORUS SIMMIAS CEBES CRITO AND AN ATTENDANT OF THE
PRISON
SCENE THE PRISON OF SOCRATES
PLACE OF THE NARRATION PHLIUS
ECHECRATES WERE YOU YOURSELF PHAEDO IN THE PRISON WITH SOCRATES ON
THE DAY WHEN HE DRANK THE POISON
PHAEDO YES ECHECRATES I WAS
ECHECRATES I SHOULD SO LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT HIS DEATH
WHAT DID HE SAY IN
HIS LAST HOURS WE WERE INFORMED THAT HE DIED BY TAKING POISON BUT NO
ONE KNEW ANYTHING MORE FOR NO PHLIASIAN EVER GOES TO ATHENS NOW AND IT
IS A LONG TIME SINCE ANY STRANGER FROM ATHENS HAS FOUND HIS WAY HITHER
SO THAT WE HAD NO CLEAR ACCOUNT
PHAEDO DID YOU NOT HEAR OF THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE TRIAL
ECHECRATES YES SOME ONE TOLD US ABOUT THE TRIAL AND WE COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND WHY HAVING BEEN CONDEMNED HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO DEATH
NOT AT THE TIME BUT LONG AFTERWARDS
WHAT WAS THE REASON OF THIS
PHAEDO AN ACCIDENT ECHECRATES THE STERN OF THE SHIP WHICH THE
ATHENIANS SEND TO DELOS HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN CROWNED ON THE DAY BEFORE
HE WAS TRIED
ECHECRATES WHAT IS THIS SHIP
PHAEDO IT IS THE SHIP IN WHICH ACCORDING TO ATHENIAN TRADITION
THESEUS WENT TO CRETE WHEN HE TOOK WITH HIM THE FOURTEEN YOUTHS AND WAS
THE SAVIOUR OF THEM AND OF HIMSELF
AND THEY WERE SAID TO HAVE VOWED
TO APOLLO AT THE TIME THAT IF THEY WERE SAVED THEY WOULD SEND A YEARLY
MISSION TO DELOS
NOW THIS CUSTOM STILL CONTINUES AND THE WHOLE PERIOD
OF THE VOYAGE TO AND FROM DELOS BEGINNING WHEN THE PRIEST OF APOLLO
CROWNS THE STERN OF THE SHIP IS A HOLY SEASON DURING WHICH THE CITY IS
NOT ALLOWED TO BE POLLUTED BY PUBLIC EXECUTIONS AND WHEN THE VESSEL
IS DETAINED BY CONTRARY WINDS THE TIME SPENT IN GOING AND RETURNING
IS VERY CONSIDERABLE
AS I WAS SAYING THE SHIP WAS CROWNED ON THE DAY
BEFORE THE TRIAL AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY SOCRATES LAY IN PRISON AND
WAS NOT PUT TO DEATH UNTIL LONG AFTER HE WAS CONDEMNED
ECHECRATES WHAT WAS THE MANNER OF HIS DEATH PHAEDO WHAT WAS SAID OR
DONE AND WHICH OF HIS FRIENDS WERE WITH HIM OR DID THE AUTHORITIES
FORBID THEM TO BE PRESENT SO THAT HE HAD NO FRIENDS NEAR HIM WHEN HE
DIED
PHAEDO NO THERE WERE SEVERAL OF THEM WITH HIM
ECHECRATES IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO I WISH THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME
WHAT PASSED AS EXACTLY AS YOU CAN
PHAEDO I HAVE NOTHING AT ALL TO DO AND WILL TRY TO GRATIFY YOUR WISH
TO BE REMINDED OF SOCRATES IS ALWAYS THE GREATEST DELIGHT TO ME WHETHER
I SPEAK MYSELF OR HEAR ANOTHER SPEAK OF HIM
ECHECRATES YOU WILL HAVE LISTENERS WHO ARE OF THE SAME MIND WITH YOU
AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BE AS EXACT AS YOU CAN
PHAEDO I HAD A SINGULAR FEELING AT BEING IN HIS COMPANY
FOR I
COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT I WAS PRESENT AT THE DEATH OF A FRIEND AND
THEREFORE I DID NOT PITY HIM ECHECRATES HE DIED SO FEARLESSLY AND
HIS WORDS AND BEARING WERE SO NOBLE AND GRACIOUS THAT TO ME HE APPEARED
BLESSED
I THOUGHT THAT IN GOING TO THE OTHER WORLD HE COULD NOT BE
WITHOUT A DIVINE CALL AND THAT HE WOULD BE HAPPY IF ANY MAN EVER WAS
WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE AND THEREFORE I DID NOT PITY HIM AS MIGHT HAVE
SEEMED NATURAL AT SUCH AN HOUR
BUT I HAD NOT THE PLEASURE WHICH I
USUALLY FEEL IN PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE FOR PHILOSOPHY WAS THE THEME
OF WHICH WE SPOKE
I WAS PLEASED BUT IN THE PLEASURE THERE WAS ALSO A
STRANGE ADMIXTURE OF PAIN FOR I REFLECTED THAT HE WAS SOON TO DIE AND
THIS DOUBLE FEELING WAS SHARED BY US ALL WE WERE LAUGHING AND WEEPING
BY TURNS ESPECIALLY THE EXCITABLE APOLLODORUS YOU KNOW THE SORT OF
MAN
ECHECRATES YES
PHAEDO HE WAS QUITE BESIDE HIMSELF AND I AND ALL OF US WERE GREATLY
MOVED
ECHECRATES WHO WERE PRESENT
PHAEDO OF NATIVE ATHENIANS THERE WERE BESIDES APOLLODORUS CRITOBULUS
AND HIS FATHER CRITO HERMOGENES EPIGENES AESCHINES ANTISTHENES
LIKEWISE CTESIPPUS OF THE DEME OF PAEANIA MENEXENUS AND SOME OTHERS
PLATO IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN WAS ILL
ECHECRATES WERE THERE ANY STRANGERS
PHAEDO YES THERE WERE SIMMIAS THE THEBAN AND CEBES AND PHAEDONDES
EUCLID AND TERPISON WHO CAME FROM MEGARA
ECHECRATES AND WAS ARISTIPPUS THERE AND CLEOMBROTUS
PHAEDO NO THEY WERE SAID TO BE IN AEGINA
ECHECRATES ANY ONE ELSE
PHAEDO I THINK THAT THESE WERE NEARLY ALL
ECHECRATES WELL AND WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT
PHAEDO I WILL BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND ENDEAVOUR TO REPEAT THE
ENTIRE CONVERSATION
ON THE PREVIOUS DAYS WE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF
ASSEMBLING EARLY IN THE MORNING AT THE COURT IN WHICH THE TRIAL TOOK
PLACE AND WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM THE PRISON
THERE WE USED TO WAIT
TALKING WITH ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THE OPENING OF THE DOORS FOR THEY WERE
NOT OPENED VERY EARLY THEN WE WENT IN AND GENERALLY PASSED THE DAY
WITH SOCRATES
ON THE LAST MORNING WE ASSEMBLED SOONER THAN USUAL
HAVING HEARD ON THE DAY BEFORE WHEN WE QUITTED THE PRISON IN THE EVENING
THAT THE SACRED SHIP HAD COME FROM DELOS AND SO WE ARRANGED TO MEET
VERY EARLY AT THE ACCUSTOMED PLACE
ON OUR ARRIVAL THE JAILER WHO
ANSWERED THE DOOR INSTEAD OF ADMITTING US CAME OUT AND TOLD US TO STAY
UNTIL HE CALLED US
'FOR THE ELEVEN HE SAID 'ARE NOW WITH SOCRATES
THEY ARE TAKING OFF HIS CHAINS AND GIVING ORDERS THAT HE IS TO DIE
TO DAY HE SOON RETURNED AND SAID THAT WE MIGHT COME IN
ON ENTERING WE
FOUND SOCRATES JUST RELEASED FROM CHAINS AND XANTHIPPE WHOM YOU KNOW
SITTING BY HIM AND HOLDING HIS CHILD IN HER ARMS
WHEN SHE SAW US SHE
UTTERED A CRY AND SAID AS WOMEN WILL 'O SOCRATES THIS IS THE LAST
TIME THAT EITHER YOU WILL CONVERSE WITH YOUR FRIENDS OR THEY WITH YOU
SOCRATES TURNED TO CRITO AND SAID 'CRITO LET SOME ONE TAKE HER HOME
SOME OF CRITO'S PEOPLE ACCORDINGLY LED HER AWAY CRYING OUT AND BEATING
HERSELF
AND WHEN SHE WAS GONE SOCRATES SITTING UP ON THE COUCH BENT
AND RUBBED HIS LEG SAYING AS HE WAS RUBBING HOW SINGULAR IS THE
THING CALLED PLEASURE AND HOW CURIOUSLY RELATED TO PAIN WHICH MIGHT BE
THOUGHT TO BE THE OPPOSITE OF IT FOR THEY ARE NEVER PRESENT TO A MAN AT
THE SAME INSTANT AND YET HE WHO PURSUES EITHER IS GENERALLY COMPELLED
TO TAKE THE OTHER THEIR BODIES ARE TWO BUT THEY ARE JOINED BY A SINGLE
HEAD
AND I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT IF AESOP HAD REMEMBERED THEM HE
WOULD HAVE MADE A FABLE ABOUT GOD TRYING TO RECONCILE THEIR STRIFE AND
HOW WHEN HE COULD NOT HE FASTENED THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND THIS IS
THE REASON WHY WHEN ONE COMES THE OTHER FOLLOWS AS I KNOW BY MY OWN
EXPERIENCE NOW WHEN AFTER THE PAIN IN MY LEG WHICH WAS CAUSED BY THE
CHAIN PLEASURE APPEARS TO SUCCEED
UPON THIS CEBES SAID I AM GLAD SOCRATES THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED THE
NAME OF AESOP
FOR IT REMINDS ME OF A QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN ASKED BY
MANY AND WAS ASKED OF ME ONLY THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BY EVENUS THE
POET HE WILL BE SURE TO ASK IT AGAIN AND THEREFORE IF YOU WOULD LIKE
ME TO HAVE AN ANSWER READY FOR HIM YOU MAY AS WELL TELL ME WHAT I
SHOULD SAY TO HIM HE WANTED TO KNOW WHY YOU WHO NEVER BEFORE WROTE
A LINE OF POETRY NOW THAT YOU ARE IN PRISON ARE TURNING AESOP'S FABLES
INTO VERSE AND ALSO COMPOSING THAT HYMN IN HONOUR OF APOLLO
TELL HIM CEBES HE REPLIED WHAT IS THE TRUTH THAT I HAD NO IDEA OF
RIVALLING HIM OR HIS POEMS TO DO SO AS I KNEW WOULD BE NO EASY TASK
BUT I WANTED TO SEE WHETHER I COULD PURGE AWAY A SCRUPLE WHICH I FELT
ABOUT THE MEANING OF CERTAIN DREAMS
IN THE COURSE OF MY LIFE I HAVE
OFTEN HAD INTIMATIONS IN DREAMS 'THAT I SHOULD COMPOSE MUSIC THE SAME
DREAM CAME TO ME SOMETIMES IN ONE FORM AND SOMETIMES IN ANOTHER BUT
ALWAYS SAYING THE SAME OR NEARLY THE SAME WORDS 'CULTIVATE AND MAKE
MUSIC SAID THE DREAM
AND HITHERTO I HAD IMAGINED THAT THIS WAS ONLY
INTENDED TO EXHORT AND ENCOURAGE ME IN THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH
HAS BEEN THE PURSUIT OF MY LIFE AND IS THE NOBLEST AND BEST OF MUSIC
THE DREAM WAS BIDDING ME DO WHAT I WAS ALREADY DOING IN THE SAME WAY
THAT THE COMPETITOR IN A RACE IS BIDDEN BY THE SPECTATORS TO RUN WHEN HE
IS ALREADY RUNNING
BUT I WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THIS FOR THE DREAM MIGHT
HAVE MEANT MUSIC IN THE POPULAR SENSE OF THE WORD AND BEING UNDER
SENTENCE OF DEATH AND THE FESTIVAL GIVING ME A RESPITE I THOUGHT THAT
IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR ME TO SATISFY THE SCRUPLE AND IN OBEDIENCE TO
THE DREAM TO COMPOSE A FEW VERSES BEFORE I DEPARTED
AND FIRST I MADE
A HYMN IN HONOUR OF THE GOD OF THE FESTIVAL AND THEN CONSIDERING THAT A
POET IF HE IS REALLY TO BE A POET SHOULD NOT ONLY PUT TOGETHER WORDS
BUT SHOULD INVENT STORIES AND THAT I HAVE NO INVENTION I TOOK SOME
FABLES OF AESOP WHICH I HAD READY AT HAND AND WHICH I KNEW THEY WERE
THE FIRST I CAME UPON AND TURNED THEM INTO VERSE
TELL THIS TO EVENUS
CEBES AND BID HIM BE OF GOOD CHEER SAY THAT I WOULD HAVE HIM COME
AFTER ME IF HE BE A WISE MAN AND NOT TARRY AND THAT TO DAY I AM LIKELY
TO BE GOING FOR THE ATHENIANS SAY THAT I MUST
SIMMIAS SAID WHAT A MESSAGE FOR SUCH A MAN HAVING BEEN A FREQUENT
COMPANION OF HIS I SHOULD SAY THAT AS FAR AS I KNOW HIM HE WILL NEVER
TAKE YOUR ADVICE UNLESS HE IS OBLIGED
WHY SAID SOCRATES IS NOT EVENUS A PHILOSOPHER
I THINK THAT HE IS SAID SIMMIAS
THEN HE OR ANY MAN WHO HAS THE SPIRIT OF PHILOSOPHY WILL BE WILLING TO
DIE BUT HE WILL NOT TAKE HIS OWN LIFE FOR THAT IS HELD TO BE UNLAWFUL
HERE HE CHANGED HIS POSITION AND PUT HIS LEGS OFF THE COUCH ON TO THE
GROUND AND DURING THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION HE REMAINED SITTING
WHY DO YOU SAY ENQUIRED CEBES THAT A MAN OUGHT NOT TO TAKE HIS OWN
LIFE BUT THAT THE PHILOSOPHER WILL BE READY TO FOLLOW THE DYING
SOCRATES REPLIED AND HAVE YOU CEBES AND SIMMIAS WHO ARE THE DISCIPLES
OF PHILOLAUS NEVER HEARD HIM SPEAK OF THIS
YES BUT HIS LANGUAGE WAS OBSCURE SOCRATES
MY WORDS TOO ARE ONLY AN ECHO BUT THERE IS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT
REPEAT WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND INDEED AS I AM GOING TO ANOTHER PLACE
IT IS VERY MEET FOR ME TO BE THINKING AND TALKING OF THE NATURE OF
THE PILGRIMAGE WHICH I AM ABOUT TO MAKE
WHAT CAN I DO BETTER IN THE
INTERVAL BETWEEN THIS AND THE SETTING OF THE SUN
THEN TELL ME SOCRATES WHY IS SUICIDE HELD TO BE UNLAWFUL AS I HAVE
CERTAINLY HEARD PHILOLAUS ABOUT WHOM YOU WERE JUST NOW ASKING AFFIRM
WHEN HE WAS STAYING WITH US AT THEBES AND THERE ARE OTHERS WHO SAY THE
SAME ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS MEANT BY ANY OF THEM
DO NOT LOSE HEART REPLIED SOCRATES AND THE DAY MAY COME WHEN YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WONDER WHY WHEN OTHER THINGS WHICH ARE
EVIL MAY BE GOOD AT CERTAIN TIMES AND TO CERTAIN PERSONS DEATH IS TO
BE THE ONLY EXCEPTION AND WHY WHEN A MAN IS BETTER DEAD HE IS NOT
PERMITTED TO BE HIS OWN BENEFACTOR BUT MUST WAIT FOR THE HAND OF
ANOTHER
VERY TRUE SAID CEBES LAUGHING GENTLY AND SPEAKING IN HIS NATIVE
BOEOTIAN
I ADMIT THE APPEARANCE OF INCONSISTENCY IN WHAT I AM SAYING BUT
THERE MAY NOT BE ANY REAL INCONSISTENCY AFTER ALL
THERE IS A DOCTRINE
WHISPERED IN SECRET THAT MAN IS A PRISONER WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO OPEN
THE DOOR AND RUN AWAY THIS IS A GREAT MYSTERY WHICH I DO NOT QUITE
UNDERSTAND
YET I TOO BELIEVE THAT THE GODS ARE OUR GUARDIANS AND THAT
WE ARE A POSSESSION OF THEIRS
DO YOU NOT AGREE
YES I QUITE AGREE SAID CEBES
AND IF ONE OF YOUR OWN POSSESSIONS AN OX OR AN ASS FOR EXAMPLE TOOK
THE LIBERTY OF PUTTING HIMSELF OUT OF THE WAY WHEN YOU HAD GIVEN NO
INTIMATION OF YOUR WISH THAT HE SHOULD DIE WOULD YOU NOT BE ANGRY WITH
HIM AND WOULD YOU NOT PUNISH HIM IF YOU COULD
CERTAINLY REPLIED CEBES
THEN IF WE LOOK AT THE MATTER THUS THERE MAY BE REASON IN SAYING THAT
A MAN SHOULD WAIT AND NOT TAKE HIS OWN LIFE UNTIL GOD SUMMONS HIM AS
HE IS NOW SUMMONING ME
YES SOCRATES SAID CEBES THERE SEEMS TO BE TRUTH IN WHAT YOU SAY
AND
YET HOW CAN YOU RECONCILE THIS SEEMINGLY TRUE BELIEF THAT GOD IS OUR
GUARDIAN AND WE HIS POSSESSIONS WITH THE WILLINGNESS TO DIE WHICH WE
WERE JUST NOW ATTRIBUTING TO THE PHILOSOPHER THAT THE WISEST OF MEN
SHOULD BE WILLING TO LEAVE A SERVICE IN WHICH THEY ARE RULED BY THE GODS
WHO ARE THE BEST OF RULERS IS NOT REASONABLE FOR SURELY NO WISE MAN
THINKS THAT WHEN SET AT LIBERTY HE CAN TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIMSELF THAN
THE GODS TAKE OF HIM
A FOOL MAY PERHAPS THINK SO HE MAY ARGUE THAT HE
HAD BETTER RUN AWAY FROM HIS MASTER NOT CONSIDERING THAT HIS DUTY IS
TO REMAIN TO THE END AND NOT TO RUN AWAY FROM THE GOOD AND THAT THERE
WOULD BE NO SENSE IN HIS RUNNING AWAY
THE WISE MAN WILL WANT TO BE EVER
WITH HIM WHO IS BETTER THAN HIMSELF
NOW THIS SOCRATES IS THE REVERSE
OF WHAT WAS JUST NOW SAID FOR UPON THIS VIEW THE WISE MAN SHOULD SORROW
AND THE FOOL REJOICE AT PASSING OUT OF LIFE
THE EARNESTNESS OF CEBES SEEMED TO PLEASE SOCRATES
HERE SAID HE
TURNING TO US IS A MAN WHO IS ALWAYS INQUIRING AND IS NOT SO EASILY
CONVINCED BY THE FIRST THING WHICH HE HEARS
AND CERTAINLY ADDED SIMMIAS THE OBJECTION WHICH HE IS NOW MAKING DOES
APPEAR TO ME TO HAVE SOME FORCE
FOR WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF A TRULY
WISE MAN WANTING TO FLY AWAY AND LIGHTLY LEAVE A MASTER WHO IS BETTER
THAN HIMSELF AND I RATHER IMAGINE THAT CEBES IS REFERRING TO YOU HE
THINKS THAT YOU ARE TOO READY TO LEAVE US AND TOO READY TO LEAVE THE
GODS WHOM YOU ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE OUR GOOD MASTERS
YES REPLIED SOCRATES THERE IS REASON IN WHAT YOU SAY
AND SO YOU THINK
THAT I OUGHT TO ANSWER YOUR INDICTMENT AS IF I WERE IN A COURT
WE SHOULD LIKE YOU TO DO SO SAID SIMMIAS
THEN I MUST TRY TO MAKE A MORE SUCCESSFUL DEFENCE BEFORE YOU THAN I
DID WHEN BEFORE THE JUDGES
FOR I AM QUITE READY TO ADMIT SIMMIAS AND
CEBES THAT I OUGHT TO BE GRIEVED AT DEATH IF I WERE NOT PERSUADED IN
THE FIRST PLACE THAT I AM GOING TO OTHER GODS WHO ARE WISE AND GOOD OF
WHICH I AM AS CERTAIN AS I CAN BE OF ANY SUCH MATTERS AND SECONDLY
THOUGH I AM NOT SO SURE OF THIS LAST TO MEN DEPARTED BETTER THAN
THOSE WHOM I LEAVE BEHIND AND THEREFORE I DO NOT GRIEVE AS I MIGHT HAVE
DONE FOR I HAVE GOOD HOPE THAT THERE IS YET SOMETHING REMAINING FOR THE
DEAD AND AS HAS BEEN SAID OF OLD SOME FAR BETTER THING FOR THE GOOD
THAN FOR THE EVIL
BUT DO YOU MEAN TO TAKE AWAY YOUR THOUGHTS WITH YOU SOCRATES SAID
SIMMIAS
WILL YOU NOT IMPART THEM TO US FOR THEY ARE A BENEFIT
IN WHICH WE TOO ARE ENTITLED TO SHARE
MOREOVER IF YOU SUCCEED IN
CONVINCING US THAT WILL BE AN ANSWER TO THE CHARGE AGAINST YOURSELF
I WILL DO MY BEST REPLIED SOCRATES
BUT YOU MUST FIRST LET ME HEAR WHAT
CRITO WANTS HE HAS LONG BEEN WISHING TO SAY SOMETHING TO ME
ONLY THIS SOCRATES REPLIED CRITO THE ATTENDANT WHO IS TO GIVE YOU
THE POISON HAS BEEN TELLING ME AND HE WANTS ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU
ARE NOT TO TALK MUCH TALKING HE SAYS INCREASES HEAT AND THIS IS
APT TO INTERFERE WITH THE ACTION OF THE POISON PERSONS WHO EXCITE
THEMSELVES ARE SOMETIMES OBLIGED TO TAKE A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD DOSE
THEN SAID SOCRATES LET HIM MIND HIS BUSINESS AND BE PREPARED TO GIVE
THE POISON TWICE OR EVEN THRICE IF NECESSARY THAT IS ALL
I KNEW QUITE WELL WHAT YOU WOULD SAY REPLIED CRITO BUT I WAS OBLIGED
TO SATISFY HIM
NEVER MIND HIM HE SAID
AND NOW O MY JUDGES I DESIRE TO PROVE TO YOU THAT THE REAL PHILOSOPHER
HAS REASON TO BE OF GOOD CHEER WHEN HE IS ABOUT TO DIE AND THAT AFTER
DEATH HE MAY HOPE TO OBTAIN THE GREATEST GOOD IN THE OTHER WORLD
AND
HOW THIS MAY BE SIMMIAS AND CEBES I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN
FOR I
DEEM THAT THE TRUE VOTARY OF PHILOSOPHY IS LIKELY TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD
BY OTHER MEN THEY DO NOT PERCEIVE THAT HE IS ALWAYS PURSUING DEATH AND
DYING AND IF THIS BE SO AND HE HAS HAD THE DESIRE OF DEATH ALL HIS
LIFE LONG WHY WHEN HIS TIME COMES SHOULD HE REPINE AT THAT WHICH HE HAS
BEEN ALWAYS PURSUING AND DESIRING
SIMMIAS SAID LAUGHINGLY THOUGH NOT IN A LAUGHING HUMOUR YOU HAVE MADE
ME LAUGH SOCRATES FOR I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THE MANY WHEN THEY
HEAR YOUR WORDS WILL SAY HOW TRULY YOU HAVE DESCRIBED PHILOSOPHERS AND
OUR PEOPLE AT HOME WILL LIKEWISE SAY THAT THE LIFE WHICH PHILOSOPHERS
DESIRE IS IN REALITY DEATH AND THAT THEY HAVE FOUND THEM OUT TO BE
DESERVING OF THE DEATH WHICH THEY DESIRE
AND THEY ARE RIGHT SIMMIAS IN THINKING SO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
WORDS 'THEY HAVE FOUND THEM OUT' FOR THEY HAVE NOT FOUND OUT EITHER
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT DEATH WHICH THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER DESERVES
OR HOW HE DESERVES OR DESIRES DEATH
BUT ENOUGH OF THEM LET US DISCUSS
THE MATTER AMONG OURSELVES DO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS
DEATH
TO BE SURE REPLIED SIMMIAS
IS IT NOT THE SEPARATION OF SOUL AND BODY AND TO BE DEAD IS THE
COMPLETION OF THIS WHEN THE SOUL EXISTS IN HERSELF AND IS RELEASED
FROM THE BODY AND THE BODY IS RELEASED FROM THE SOUL WHAT IS THIS BUT
DEATH
JUST SO HE REPLIED
THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH WILL PROBABLY THROW LIGHT ON OUR
PRESENT INQUIRY IF YOU AND I CAN AGREE ABOUT IT OUGHT THE PHILOSOPHER
TO CARE ABOUT THE PLEASURES IF THEY ARE TO BE CALLED PLEASURES OF
EATING AND DRINKING
CERTAINLY NOT ANSWERED SIMMIAS
AND WHAT ABOUT THE PLEASURES OF LOVE SHOULD HE CARE FOR THEM
BY NO MEANS
AND WILL HE THINK MUCH OF THE OTHER WAYS OF INDULGING THE BODY FOR
EXAMPLE THE ACQUISITION OF COSTLY RAIMENT OR SANDALS OR OTHER
ADORNMENTS OF THE BODY INSTEAD OF CARING ABOUT THEM DOES HE NOT RATHER
DESPISE ANYTHING MORE THAN NATURE NEEDS WHAT DO YOU SAY
I SHOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER WOULD DESPISE THEM
WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT HE IS ENTIRELY CONCERNED WITH THE SOUL AND NOT
WITH THE BODY HE WOULD LIKE AS FAR AS HE CAN TO GET AWAY FROM THE
BODY AND TO TURN TO THE SOUL
QUITE TRUE
IN MATTERS OF THIS SORT PHILOSOPHERS ABOVE ALL OTHER MEN MAY BE
OBSERVED IN EVERY SORT OF WAY TO DISSEVER THE SOUL FROM THE COMMUNION OF
THE BODY
VERY TRUE
WHEREAS SIMMIAS THE REST OF THE WORLD ARE OF OPINION THAT TO HIM WHO
HAS NO SENSE OF PLEASURE AND NO PART IN BODILY PLEASURE LIFE IS NOT
WORTH HAVING AND THAT HE WHO IS INDIFFERENT ABOUT THEM IS AS GOOD AS
DEAD
THAT IS ALSO TRUE
WHAT AGAIN SHALL WE SAY OF THE ACTUAL ACQUIREMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IS THE
BODY IF INVITED TO SHARE IN THE ENQUIRY A HINDERER OR A HELPER I MEAN
TO SAY HAVE SIGHT AND HEARING ANY TRUTH IN THEM ARE THEY NOT AS THE
POETS ARE ALWAYS TELLING US INACCURATE WITNESSES AND YET IF EVEN
THEY ARE INACCURATE AND INDISTINCT WHAT IS TO BE SAID OF THE OTHER
SENSES FOR YOU WILL ALLOW THAT THEY ARE THE BEST OF THEM
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
THEN WHEN DOES THE SOUL ATTAIN TRUTH FOR IN ATTEMPTING TO CONSIDER
ANYTHING IN COMPANY WITH THE BODY SHE IS OBVIOUSLY DECEIVED
TRUE
THEN MUST NOT TRUE EXISTENCE BE REVEALED TO HER IN THOUGHT IF AT ALL
YES
AND THOUGHT IS BEST WHEN THE MIND IS GATHERED INTO HERSELF AND NONE OF
THESE THINGS TROUBLE HER NEITHER SOUNDS NOR SIGHTS NOR PAIN NOR ANY
PLEASURE WHEN SHE TAKES LEAVE OF THE BODY AND HAS AS LITTLE AS
POSSIBLE TO DO WITH IT WHEN SHE HAS NO BODILY SENSE OR DESIRE BUT IS
ASPIRING AFTER TRUE BEING
CERTAINLY
AND IN THIS THE PHILOSOPHER DISHONOURS THE BODY HIS SOUL RUNS AWAY FROM
HIS BODY AND DESIRES TO BE ALONE AND BY HERSELF
THAT IS TRUE
WELL BUT THERE IS ANOTHER THING SIMMIAS IS THERE OR IS THERE NOT AN
ABSOLUTE JUSTICE
ASSUREDLY THERE IS
AND AN ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AND ABSOLUTE GOOD
OF COURSE
BUT DID YOU EVER BEHOLD ANY OF THEM WITH YOUR EYES
CERTAINLY NOT
OR DID YOU EVER REACH THEM WITH ANY OTHER BODILY SENSE AND I SPEAK NOT
OF THESE ALONE BUT OF ABSOLUTE GREATNESS AND HEALTH AND STRENGTH
AND OF THE ESSENCE OR TRUE NATURE OF EVERYTHING
HAS THE REALITY OF THEM
EVER BEEN PERCEIVED BY YOU THROUGH THE BODILY ORGANS OR RATHER IS NOT
THE NEAREST APPROACH TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SEVERAL NATURES MADE
BY HIM WHO SO ORDERS HIS INTELLECTUAL VISION AS TO HAVE THE MOST EXACT
CONCEPTION OF THE ESSENCE OF EACH THING WHICH HE CONSIDERS
CERTAINLY
AND HE ATTAINS TO THE PUREST KNOWLEDGE OF THEM WHO GOES TO EACH WITH THE
MIND ALONE NOT INTRODUCING OR INTRUDING IN THE ACT OF THOUGHT SIGHT
OR ANY OTHER SENSE TOGETHER WITH REASON BUT WITH THE VERY LIGHT OF THE
MIND IN HER OWN CLEARNESS SEARCHES INTO THE VERY TRUTH OF EACH HE WHO
HAS GOT RID AS FAR AS HE CAN OF EYES AND EARS AND SO TO SPEAK OF THE
WHOLE BODY THESE BEING IN HIS OPINION DISTRACTING ELEMENTS WHICH WHEN
THEY INFECT THE SOUL HINDER HER FROM ACQUIRING TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE WHO
IF NOT HE IS LIKELY TO ATTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUE BEING
WHAT YOU SAY HAS A WONDERFUL TRUTH IN IT SOCRATES REPLIED SIMMIAS
AND WHEN REAL PHILOSOPHERS CONSIDER ALL THESE THINGS WILL THEY NOT BE
LED TO MAKE A REFLECTION WHICH THEY WILL EXPRESS IN WORDS SOMETHING LIKE
THE FOLLOWING 'HAVE WE NOT FOUND THEY WILL SAY 'A PATH OF THOUGHT
WHICH SEEMS TO BRING US AND OUR ARGUMENT TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WHILE
WE ARE IN THE BODY AND WHILE THE SOUL IS INFECTED WITH THE EVILS OF THE
BODY OUR DESIRE WILL NOT BE SATISFIED AND OUR DESIRE IS OF THE TRUTH
FOR THE BODY IS A SOURCE OF ENDLESS TROUBLE TO US BY REASON OF THE MERE
REQUIREMENT OF FOOD AND IS LIABLE ALSO TO DISEASES WHICH OVERTAKE AND
IMPEDE US IN THE SEARCH AFTER TRUE BEING IT FILLS US FULL OF LOVES AND
LUSTS AND FEARS AND FANCIES OF ALL KINDS AND ENDLESS FOOLERY AND
IN FACT AS MEN SAY TAKES AWAY FROM US THE POWER OF THINKING AT ALL
WHENCE COME WARS AND FIGHTINGS AND FACTIONS WHENCE BUT FROM THE BODY
AND THE LUSTS OF THE BODY WARS ARE OCCASIONED BY THE LOVE OF MONEY AND
MONEY HAS TO BE ACQUIRED FOR THE SAKE AND IN THE SERVICE OF THE BODY
AND BY REASON OF ALL THESE IMPEDIMENTS WE HAVE NO TIME TO GIVE TO
PHILOSOPHY AND LAST AND WORST OF ALL EVEN IF WE ARE AT LEISURE AND
BETAKE OURSELVES TO SOME SPECULATION THE BODY IS ALWAYS BREAKING IN
UPON US CAUSING TURMOIL AND CONFUSION IN OUR ENQUIRIES AND SO AMAZING
US THAT WE ARE PREVENTED FROM SEEING THE TRUTH
IT HAS BEEN PROVED TO US
BY EXPERIENCE THAT IF WE WOULD HAVE PURE KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING WE
MUST BE QUIT OF THE BODY THE SOUL IN HERSELF MUST BEHOLD THINGS IN
THEMSELVES AND THEN WE SHALL ATTAIN THE WISDOM WHICH WE DESIRE AND OF
WHICH WE SAY THAT WE ARE LOVERS NOT WHILE WE LIVE BUT AFTER DEATH FOR
IF WHILE IN COMPANY WITH THE BODY THE SOUL CANNOT HAVE PURE KNOWLEDGE
ONE OF TWO THINGS FOLLOWS EITHER KNOWLEDGE IS NOT TO BE ATTAINED AT
ALL OR IF AT ALL AFTER DEATH
FOR THEN AND NOT TILL THEN THE SOUL
WILL BE PARTED FROM THE BODY AND EXIST IN HERSELF ALONE
IN THIS PRESENT
LIFE I RECKON THAT WE MAKE THE NEAREST APPROACH TO KNOWLEDGE WHEN WE
HAVE THE LEAST POSSIBLE INTERCOURSE OR COMMUNION WITH THE BODY AND ARE
NOT SURFEITED WITH THE BODILY NATURE BUT KEEP OURSELVES PURE UNTIL THE
HOUR WHEN GOD HIMSELF IS PLEASED TO RELEASE US
AND THUS HAVING GOT RID
OF THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE BODY WE SHALL BE PURE AND HOLD CONVERSE WITH
THE PURE AND KNOW OF OURSELVES THE CLEAR LIGHT EVERYWHERE WHICH IS
NO OTHER THAN THE LIGHT OF TRUTH FOR THE IMPURE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO
APPROACH THE PURE
THESE ARE THE SORT OF WORDS SIMMIAS WHICH THE TRUE
LOVERS OF KNOWLEDGE CANNOT HELP SAYING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THINKING
YOU
WOULD AGREE WOULD YOU NOT
UNDOUBTEDLY SOCRATES
BUT O MY FRIEND IF THIS IS TRUE THERE IS GREAT REASON TO HOPE THAT
GOING WHITHER I GO WHEN I HAVE COME TO THE END OF MY JOURNEY I SHALL
ATTAIN THAT WHICH HAS BEEN THE PURSUIT OF MY LIFE
AND THEREFORE I GO ON
MY WAY REJOICING AND NOT I ONLY BUT EVERY OTHER MAN WHO BELIEVES THAT
HIS MIND HAS BEEN MADE READY AND THAT HE IS IN A MANNER PURIFIED
CERTAINLY REPLIED SIMMIAS
AND WHAT IS PURIFICATION BUT THE SEPARATION OF THE SOUL FROM THE BODY
AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE THE HABIT OF THE SOUL GATHERING AND COLLECTING
HERSELF INTO HERSELF FROM ALL SIDES OUT OF THE BODY THE DWELLING IN
HER OWN PLACE ALONE AS IN ANOTHER LIFE SO ALSO IN THIS AS FAR AS SHE
CAN THE RELEASE OF THE SOUL FROM THE CHAINS OF THE BODY
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND THIS SEPARATION AND RELEASE OF THE SOUL FROM THE BODY IS TERMED
DEATH
TO BE SURE HE SAID
AND THE TRUE PHILOSOPHERS AND THEY ONLY ARE EVER SEEKING TO RELEASE
THE SOUL
IS NOT THE SEPARATION AND RELEASE OF THE SOUL FROM THE BODY
THEIR ESPECIAL STUDY
THAT IS TRUE
AND AS I WAS SAYING AT FIRST THERE WOULD BE A RIDICULOUS CONTRADICTION
IN MEN STUDYING TO LIVE AS NEARLY AS THEY CAN IN A STATE OF DEATH AND
YET REPINING WHEN IT COMES UPON THEM
CLEARLY
AND THE TRUE PHILOSOPHERS SIMMIAS ARE ALWAYS OCCUPIED IN THE PRACTICE
OF DYING WHEREFORE ALSO TO THEM LEAST OF ALL MEN IS DEATH TERRIBLE
LOOK AT THE MATTER THUS IF THEY HAVE BEEN IN EVERY WAY THE ENEMIES OF
THE BODY AND ARE WANTING TO BE ALONE WITH THE SOUL WHEN THIS DESIRE OF
THEIRS IS GRANTED HOW INCONSISTENT WOULD THEY BE IF THEY TREMBLED AND
REPINED INSTEAD OF REJOICING AT THEIR DEPARTURE TO THAT PLACE WHERE
WHEN THEY ARRIVE THEY HOPE TO GAIN THAT WHICH IN LIFE THEY DESIRED AND
THIS WAS WISDOM AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE RID OF THE COMPANY OF THEIR
ENEMY
MANY A MAN HAS BEEN WILLING TO GO TO THE WORLD BELOW ANIMATED
BY THE HOPE OF SEEING THERE AN EARTHLY LOVE OR WIFE OR SON AND
CONVERSING WITH THEM
AND WILL HE WHO IS A TRUE LOVER OF WISDOM AND IS
STRONGLY PERSUADED IN LIKE MANNER THAT ONLY IN THE WORLD BELOW HE CAN
WORTHILY ENJOY HER STILL REPINE AT DEATH WILL HE NOT DEPART WITH JOY
SURELY HE WILL O MY FRIEND IF HE BE A TRUE PHILOSOPHER
FOR HE WILL
HAVE A FIRM CONVICTION THAT THERE AND THERE ONLY HE CAN FIND WISDOM
IN HER PURITY
AND IF THIS BE TRUE HE WOULD BE VERY ABSURD AS I WAS
SAYING IF HE WERE AFRAID OF DEATH
HE WOULD INDEED REPLIED SIMMIAS
AND WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WHO IS REPINING AT THE APPROACH OF DEATH IS NOT
HIS RELUCTANCE A SUFFICIENT PROOF THAT HE IS NOT A LOVER OF WISDOM BUT
A LOVER OF THE BODY AND PROBABLY AT THE SAME TIME A LOVER OF EITHER
MONEY OR POWER OR BOTH
QUITE SO HE REPLIED
AND IS NOT COURAGE SIMMIAS A QUALITY WHICH IS SPECIALLY CHARACTERISTIC
OF THE PHILOSOPHER
CERTAINLY
THERE IS TEMPERANCE AGAIN WHICH EVEN BY THE VULGAR IS SUPPOSED TO
CONSIST IN THE CONTROL AND REGULATION OF THE PASSIONS AND IN THE SENSE
OF SUPERIORITY TO THEM IS NOT TEMPERANCE A VIRTUE BELONGING TO THOSE
ONLY WHO DESPISE THE BODY AND WHO PASS THEIR LIVES IN PHILOSOPHY
MOST ASSUREDLY
FOR THE COURAGE AND TEMPERANCE OF OTHER MEN IF YOU WILL CONSIDER THEM
ARE REALLY A CONTRADICTION
HOW SO
WELL HE SAID YOU ARE AWARE THAT DEATH IS REGARDED BY MEN IN GENERAL AS
A GREAT EVIL
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND DO NOT COURAGEOUS MEN FACE DEATH BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF YET
GREATER EVILS
THAT IS QUITE TRUE
THEN ALL BUT THE PHILOSOPHERS ARE COURAGEOUS ONLY FROM FEAR AND BECAUSE
THEY ARE AFRAID AND YET THAT A MAN SHOULD BE COURAGEOUS FROM FEAR AND
BECAUSE HE IS A COWARD IS SURELY A STRANGE THING
VERY TRUE
AND ARE NOT THE TEMPERATE EXACTLY IN THE SAME CASE THEY ARE TEMPERATE
BECAUSE THEY ARE INTEMPERATE WHICH MIGHT SEEM TO BE A CONTRADICTION
BUT IS NEVERTHELESS THE SORT OF THING WHICH HAPPENS WITH THIS FOOLISH
TEMPERANCE
FOR THERE ARE PLEASURES WHICH THEY ARE AFRAID OF LOSING AND
IN THEIR DESIRE TO KEEP THEM THEY ABSTAIN FROM SOME PLEASURES BECAUSE
THEY ARE OVERCOME BY OTHERS AND ALTHOUGH TO BE CONQUERED BY PLEASURE IS
CALLED BY MEN INTEMPERANCE TO THEM THE CONQUEST OF PLEASURE CONSISTS IN
BEING CONQUERED BY PLEASURE
AND THAT IS WHAT I MEAN BY SAYING THAT IN
A SENSE THEY ARE MADE TEMPERATE THROUGH INTEMPERANCE
SUCH APPEARS TO BE THE CASE
YET THE EXCHANGE OF ONE FEAR OR PLEASURE OR PAIN FOR ANOTHER FEAR OR
PLEASURE OR PAIN AND OF THE GREATER FOR THE LESS AS IF THEY WERE
COINS IS NOT THE EXCHANGE OF VIRTUE
O MY BLESSED SIMMIAS IS THERE NOT
ONE TRUE COIN FOR WHICH ALL THINGS OUGHT TO BE EXCHANGED AND THAT
IS WISDOM AND ONLY IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS AND IN COMPANY WITH THIS IS
ANYTHING TRULY BOUGHT OR SOLD WHETHER COURAGE OR TEMPERANCE OR JUSTICE
AND IS NOT ALL TRUE VIRTUE THE COMPANION OF WISDOM NO MATTER WHAT FEARS
OR PLEASURES OR OTHER SIMILAR GOODS OR EVILS MAY OR MAY NOT ATTEND HER
BUT THE VIRTUE WHICH IS MADE UP OF THESE GOODS WHEN THEY ARE SEVERED
FROM WISDOM AND EXCHANGED WITH ONE ANOTHER IS A SHADOW OF VIRTUE ONLY
NOR IS THERE ANY FREEDOM OR HEALTH OR TRUTH IN HER BUT IN THE TRUE
EXCHANGE THERE IS A PURGING AWAY OF ALL THESE THINGS AND TEMPERANCE
AND JUSTICE AND COURAGE AND WISDOM HERSELF ARE THE PURGATION OF THEM
THE FOUNDERS OF THE MYSTERIES WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A REAL MEANING
AND WERE NOT TALKING NONSENSE WHEN THEY INTIMATED IN A FIGURE LONG AGO
THAT HE WHO PASSES UNSANCTIFIED AND UNINITIATED INTO THE WORLD BELOW
WILL LIE IN A SLOUGH BUT THAT HE WHO ARRIVES THERE AFTER INITIATION AND
PURIFICATION WILL DWELL WITH THE GODS
FOR 'MANY AS THEY SAY IN THE
MYSTERIES 'ARE THE THYRSUS BEARERS BUT FEW ARE THE MYSTICS MEANING
AS I INTERPRET THE WORDS 'THE TRUE PHILOSOPHERS IN THE NUMBER
OF WHOM DURING MY WHOLE LIFE I HAVE BEEN SEEKING ACCORDING TO MY
ABILITY TO FIND A PLACE WHETHER I HAVE SOUGHT IN A RIGHT WAY OR NOT
AND WHETHER I HAVE SUCCEEDED OR NOT I SHALL TRULY KNOW IN A LITTLE
WHILE IF GOD WILL WHEN I MYSELF ARRIVE IN THE OTHER WORLD SUCH IS MY
BELIEF
AND THEREFORE I MAINTAIN THAT I AM RIGHT SIMMIAS AND CEBES
IN NOT GRIEVING OR REPINING AT PARTING FROM YOU AND MY MASTERS IN THIS
WORLD FOR I BELIEVE THAT I SHALL EQUALLY FIND GOOD MASTERS AND FRIENDS
IN ANOTHER WORLD
BUT MOST MEN DO NOT BELIEVE THIS SAYING IF THEN I
SUCCEED IN CONVINCING YOU BY MY DEFENCE BETTER THAN I DID THE ATHENIAN
JUDGES IT WILL BE WELL
CEBES ANSWERED I AGREE SOCRATES IN THE GREATER PART OF WHAT YOU SAY
BUT IN WHAT CONCERNS THE SOUL MEN ARE APT TO BE INCREDULOUS THEY FEAR
THAT WHEN SHE HAS LEFT THE BODY HER PLACE MAY BE NOWHERE AND THAT ON
THE VERY DAY OF DEATH SHE MAY PERISH AND COME TO AN END IMMEDIATELY ON
HER RELEASE FROM THE BODY ISSUING FORTH DISPERSED LIKE SMOKE OR AIR
AND IN HER FLIGHT VANISHING AWAY INTO NOTHINGNESS
IF SHE COULD ONLY BE
COLLECTED INTO HERSELF AFTER SHE HAS OBTAINED RELEASE FROM THE EVILS OF
WHICH YOU ARE SPEAKING THERE WOULD BE GOOD REASON TO HOPE SOCRATES
THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE
BUT SURELY IT REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF
ARGUMENT AND MANY PROOFS TO SHOW THAT WHEN THE MAN IS DEAD HIS SOUL YET
EXISTS AND HAS ANY FORCE OR INTELLIGENCE
TRUE CEBES SAID SOCRATES AND SHALL I SUGGEST THAT WE CONVERSE A
LITTLE OF THE PROBABILITIES OF THESE THINGS
I AM SURE SAID CEBES THAT I SHOULD GREATLY LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION
ABOUT THEM
I RECKON SAID SOCRATES THAT NO ONE WHO HEARD ME NOW NOT EVEN IF HE
WERE ONE OF MY OLD ENEMIES THE COMIC POETS COULD ACCUSE ME OF IDLE
TALKING ABOUT MATTERS IN WHICH I HAVE NO CONCERN IF YOU PLEASE THEN
WE WILL PROCEED WITH THE INQUIRY
SUPPOSE WE CONSIDER THE QUESTION WHETHER THE SOULS OF MEN AFTER DEATH
ARE OR ARE NOT IN THE WORLD BELOW
THERE COMES INTO MY MIND AN ANCIENT
DOCTRINE WHICH AFFIRMS THAT THEY GO FROM HENCE INTO THE OTHER WORLD AND
RETURNING HITHER ARE BORN AGAIN FROM THE DEAD
NOW IF IT BE TRUE THAT
THE LIVING COME FROM THE DEAD THEN OUR SOULS MUST EXIST IN THE OTHER
WORLD FOR IF NOT HOW COULD THEY HAVE BEEN BORN AGAIN AND THIS WOULD
BE CONCLUSIVE IF THERE WERE ANY REAL EVIDENCE THAT THE LIVING ARE ONLY
BORN FROM THE DEAD BUT IF THIS IS NOT SO THEN OTHER ARGUMENTS WILL
HAVE TO BE ADDUCED
VERY TRUE REPLIED CEBES
THEN LET US CONSIDER THE WHOLE QUESTION NOT IN RELATION TO MAN ONLY
BUT IN RELATION TO ANIMALS GENERALLY AND TO PLANTS AND TO EVERYTHING
OF WHICH THERE IS GENERATION AND THE PROOF WILL BE EASIER
ARE NOT ALL
THINGS WHICH HAVE OPPOSITES GENERATED OUT OF THEIR OPPOSITES I MEAN
SUCH THINGS AS GOOD AND EVIL JUST AND UNJUST AND THERE ARE INNUMERABLE
OTHER OPPOSITES WHICH ARE GENERATED OUT OF OPPOSITES
AND I WANT TO SHOW
THAT IN ALL OPPOSITES THERE IS OF NECESSITY A SIMILAR ALTERNATION
I MEAN TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT ANYTHING WHICH BECOMES GREATER MUST
BECOME GREATER AFTER BEING LESS
TRUE
AND THAT WHICH BECOMES LESS MUST HAVE BEEN ONCE GREATER AND THEN HAVE
BECOME LESS
YES
AND THE WEAKER IS GENERATED FROM THE STRONGER AND THE SWIFTER FROM THE
SLOWER
VERY TRUE
AND THE WORSE IS FROM THE BETTER AND THE MORE JUST IS FROM THE MORE
UNJUST
OF COURSE
AND IS THIS TRUE OF ALL OPPOSITES AND ARE WE CONVINCED THAT ALL OF THEM
ARE GENERATED OUT OF OPPOSITES
YES
AND IN THIS UNIVERSAL OPPOSITION OF ALL THINGS ARE THERE NOT ALSO TWO
INTERMEDIATE PROCESSES WHICH ARE EVER GOING ON FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
OPPOSITE AND BACK AGAIN WHERE THERE IS A GREATER AND A LESS THERE IS
ALSO AN INTERMEDIATE PROCESS OF INCREASE AND DIMINUTION AND THAT WHICH
GROWS IS SAID TO WAX AND THAT WHICH DECAYS TO WANE
YES HE SAID
AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER PROCESSES SUCH AS DIVISION AND COMPOSITION
COOLING AND HEATING WHICH EQUALLY INVOLVE A PASSAGE INTO AND OUT OF ONE
ANOTHER
AND THIS NECESSARILY HOLDS OF ALL OPPOSITES EVEN THOUGH NOT
ALWAYS EXPRESSED IN WORDS THEY ARE REALLY GENERATED OUT OF ONE ANOTHER
AND THERE IS A PASSING OR PROCESS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF THEM
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
WELL AND IS THERE NOT AN OPPOSITE OF LIFE AS SLEEP IS THE OPPOSITE OF
WAKING
TRUE HE SAID
AND WHAT IS IT
DEATH HE ANSWERED
AND THESE IF THEY ARE OPPOSITES ARE GENERATED THE ONE FROM THE OTHER
AND HAVE THERE THEIR TWO INTERMEDIATE PROCESSES ALSO
OF COURSE
NOW SAID SOCRATES I WILL ANALYZE ONE OF THE TWO PAIRS OF OPPOSITES
WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED TO YOU AND ALSO ITS INTERMEDIATE PROCESSES AND
YOU SHALL ANALYZE THE OTHER TO ME
ONE OF THEM I TERM SLEEP THE OTHER
WAKING
THE STATE OF SLEEP IS OPPOSED TO THE STATE OF WAKING AND OUT
OF SLEEPING WAKING IS GENERATED AND OUT OF WAKING SLEEPING AND THE
PROCESS OF GENERATION IS IN THE ONE CASE FALLING ASLEEP AND IN THE
OTHER WAKING UP
DO YOU AGREE
I ENTIRELY AGREE
THEN SUPPOSE THAT YOU ANALYZE LIFE AND DEATH TO ME IN THE SAME MANNER
IS NOT DEATH OPPOSED TO LIFE
YES
AND THEY ARE GENERATED ONE FROM THE OTHER
YES
WHAT IS GENERATED FROM THE LIVING
THE DEAD
AND WHAT FROM THE DEAD
I CAN ONLY SAY IN ANSWER THE LIVING
THEN THE LIVING WHETHER THINGS OR PERSONS CEBES ARE GENERATED FROM
THE DEAD
THAT IS CLEAR HE REPLIED
THEN THE INFERENCE IS THAT OUR SOULS EXIST IN THE WORLD BELOW
THAT IS TRUE
AND ONE OF THE TWO PROCESSES OR GENERATIONS IS VISIBLE FOR SURELY THE
ACT OF DYING IS VISIBLE
SURELY HE SAID
WHAT THEN IS TO BE THE RESULT SHALL WE EXCLUDE THE OPPOSITE PROCESS
AND SHALL WE SUPPOSE NATURE TO WALK ON ONE LEG ONLY MUST WE NOT RATHER
ASSIGN TO DEATH SOME CORRESPONDING PROCESS OF GENERATION
CERTAINLY HE REPLIED
AND WHAT IS THAT PROCESS
RETURN TO LIFE
AND RETURN TO LIFE IF THERE BE SUCH A THING IS THE BIRTH OF THE DEAD
INTO THE WORLD OF THE LIVING
QUITE TRUE
THEN HERE IS A NEW WAY BY WHICH WE ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
LIVING COME FROM THE DEAD JUST AS THE DEAD COME FROM THE LIVING AND
THIS IF TRUE AFFORDS A MOST CERTAIN PROOF THAT THE SOULS OF THE DEAD
EXIST IN SOME PLACE OUT OF WHICH THEY COME AGAIN
YES SOCRATES HE SAID THE CONCLUSION SEEMS TO FLOW NECESSARILY OUT OF
OUR PREVIOUS ADMISSIONS
AND THAT THESE ADMISSIONS WERE NOT UNFAIR CEBES HE SAID MAY BE SHOWN
I THINK AS FOLLOWS IF GENERATION WERE IN A STRAIGHT LINE ONLY AND
THERE WERE NO COMPENSATION OR CIRCLE IN NATURE NO TURN OR RETURN OF
ELEMENTS INTO THEIR OPPOSITES THEN YOU KNOW THAT ALL THINGS WOULD AT
LAST HAVE THE SAME FORM AND PASS INTO THE SAME STATE AND THERE WOULD BE
NO MORE GENERATION OF THEM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE SAID
A SIMPLE THING ENOUGH WHICH I WILL ILLUSTRATE BY THE CASE OF SLEEP
HE REPLIED
YOU KNOW THAT IF THERE WERE NO ALTERNATION OF SLEEPING
AND WAKING THE TALE OF THE SLEEPING ENDYMION WOULD IN THE END HAVE NO
MEANING BECAUSE ALL OTHER THINGS WOULD BE ASLEEP TOO AND HE WOULD NOT
BE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE REST
OR IF THERE WERE COMPOSITION ONLY
AND NO DIVISION OF SUBSTANCES THEN THE CHAOS OF ANAXAGORAS WOULD COME
AGAIN
AND IN LIKE MANNER MY DEAR CEBES IF ALL THINGS WHICH PARTOOK
OF LIFE WERE TO DIE AND AFTER THEY WERE DEAD REMAINED IN THE FORM
OF DEATH AND DID NOT COME TO LIFE AGAIN ALL WOULD AT LAST DIE AND
NOTHING WOULD BE ALIVE WHAT OTHER RESULT COULD THERE BE FOR IF THE
LIVING SPRING FROM ANY OTHER THINGS AND THEY TOO DIE MUST NOT ALL
THINGS AT LAST BE SWALLOWED UP IN DEATH BUT COMPARE REPUBLIC
THERE IS NO ESCAPE SOCRATES SAID CEBES AND TO ME YOUR ARGUMENT SEEMS
TO BE ABSOLUTELY TRUE
YES HE SAID CEBES IT IS AND MUST BE SO IN MY OPINION AND WE HAVE
NOT BEEN DELUDED IN MAKING THESE ADMISSIONS BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT
THERE TRULY IS SUCH A THING AS LIVING AGAIN AND THAT THE LIVING SPRING
FROM THE DEAD AND THAT THE SOULS OF THE DEAD ARE IN EXISTENCE AND THAT
THE GOOD SOULS HAVE A BETTER PORTION THAN THE EVIL
CEBES ADDED YOUR FAVORITE DOCTRINE SOCRATES THAT KNOWLEDGE IS SIMPLY
RECOLLECTION IF TRUE ALSO NECESSARILY IMPLIES A PREVIOUS TIME IN
WHICH WE HAVE LEARNED THAT WHICH WE NOW RECOLLECT
BUT THIS WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS OUR SOUL HAD BEEN IN SOME PLACE BEFORE EXISTING IN THE
FORM OF MAN HERE THEN IS ANOTHER PROOF OF THE SOUL'S IMMORTALITY
BUT TELL ME CEBES SAID SIMMIAS INTERPOSING WHAT ARGUMENTS ARE URGED
IN FAVOUR OF THIS DOCTRINE OF RECOLLECTION
I AM NOT VERY SURE AT THE
MOMENT THAT I REMEMBER THEM
ONE EXCELLENT PROOF SAID CEBES IS AFFORDED BY QUESTIONS
IF YOU PUT
A QUESTION TO A PERSON IN A RIGHT WAY HE WILL GIVE A TRUE ANSWER OF
HIMSELF BUT HOW COULD HE DO THIS UNLESS THERE WERE KNOWLEDGE AND RIGHT
REASON ALREADY IN HIM AND THIS IS MOST CLEARLY SHOWN WHEN HE IS TAKEN
TO A DIAGRAM OR TO ANYTHING OF THAT SORT
COMPARE MENO
BUT IF SAID SOCRATES YOU ARE STILL INCREDULOUS SIMMIAS I WOULD ASK
YOU WHETHER YOU MAY NOT AGREE WITH ME WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MATTER
IN ANOTHER WAY I MEAN IF YOU ARE STILL INCREDULOUS AS TO WHETHER
KNOWLEDGE IS RECOLLECTION
INCREDULOUS I AM NOT SAID SIMMIAS BUT I WANT TO HAVE THIS DOCTRINE
OF RECOLLECTION BROUGHT TO MY OWN RECOLLECTION AND FROM WHAT CEBES HAS
SAID I AM BEGINNING TO RECOLLECT AND BE CONVINCED BUT I SHOULD STILL
LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY
THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SAY HE REPLIED WE SHOULD AGREE IF I AM NOT
MISTAKEN THAT WHAT A MAN RECOLLECTS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN AT SOME PREVIOUS
TIME
VERY TRUE
AND WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS KNOWLEDGE OR RECOLLECTION I MEAN TO
ASK WHETHER A PERSON WHO HAVING SEEN OR HEARD OR IN ANY WAY PERCEIVED
ANYTHING KNOWS NOT ONLY THAT BUT HAS A CONCEPTION OF SOMETHING
ELSE WHICH IS THE SUBJECT NOT OF THE SAME BUT OF SOME OTHER KIND OF
KNOWLEDGE MAY NOT BE FAIRLY SAID TO RECOLLECT THAT OF WHICH HE HAS THE
CONCEPTION
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN WHAT I MAY ILLUSTRATE BY THE FOLLOWING INSTANCE THE KNOWLEDGE
OF A LYRE IS NOT THE SAME AS THE KNOWLEDGE OF A MAN
TRUE
AND YET WHAT IS THE FEELING OF LOVERS WHEN THEY RECOGNIZE A LYRE OR
A GARMENT OR ANYTHING ELSE WHICH THE BELOVED HAS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF
USING DO NOT THEY FROM KNOWING THE LYRE FORM IN THE MIND'S EYE AN
IMAGE OF THE YOUTH TO WHOM THE LYRE BELONGS AND THIS IS RECOLLECTION
IN LIKE MANNER ANY ONE WHO SEES SIMMIAS MAY REMEMBER CEBES AND THERE
ARE ENDLESS EXAMPLES OF THE SAME THING
ENDLESS INDEED REPLIED SIMMIAS
AND RECOLLECTION IS MOST COMMONLY A PROCESS OF RECOVERING THAT WHICH HAS
BEEN ALREADY FORGOTTEN THROUGH TIME AND INATTENTION
VERY TRUE HE SAID
WELL AND MAY YOU NOT ALSO FROM SEEING THE PICTURE OF A HORSE OR A
LYRE REMEMBER A MAN AND FROM THE PICTURE OF SIMMIAS YOU MAY BE LED TO
REMEMBER CEBES
TRUE
OR YOU MAY ALSO BE LED TO THE RECOLLECTION OF SIMMIAS HIMSELF
QUITE SO
AND IN ALL THESE CASES THE RECOLLECTION MAY BE DERIVED FROM THINGS
EITHER LIKE OR UNLIKE
IT MAY BE
AND WHEN THE RECOLLECTION IS DERIVED FROM LIKE THINGS THEN ANOTHER
CONSIDERATION IS SURE TO ARISE WHICH IS WHETHER THE LIKENESS IN ANY
DEGREE FALLS SHORT OR NOT OF THAT WHICH IS RECOLLECTED
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AND SHALL WE PROCEED A STEP FURTHER AND AFFIRM THAT THERE IS SUCH A
THING AS EQUALITY NOT OF ONE PIECE OF WOOD OR STONE WITH ANOTHER BUT
THAT OVER AND ABOVE THIS THERE IS ABSOLUTE EQUALITY SHALL WE SAY SO
SAY SO YES REPLIED SIMMIAS AND SWEAR TO IT WITH ALL THE CONFIDENCE
IN LIFE
AND DO WE KNOW THE NATURE OF THIS ABSOLUTE ESSENCE
TO BE SURE HE SAID
AND WHENCE DID WE OBTAIN OUR KNOWLEDGE DID WE NOT SEE EQUALITIES OF
MATERIAL THINGS SUCH AS PIECES OF WOOD AND STONES AND GATHER FROM
THEM THE IDEA OF AN EQUALITY WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THEM FOR YOU WILL
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
OR LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER
WAY DO NOT THE SAME PIECES OF WOOD OR STONE APPEAR AT ONE TIME EQUAL
AND AT ANOTHER TIME UNEQUAL
THAT IS CERTAIN
BUT ARE REAL EQUALS EVER UNEQUAL OR IS THE IDEA OF EQUALITY THE SAME AS
OF INEQUALITY
IMPOSSIBLE SOCRATES
THEN THESE SO CALLED EQUALS ARE NOT THE SAME WITH THE IDEA OF
EQUALITY
I SHOULD SAY CLEARLY NOT SOCRATES
AND YET FROM THESE EQUALS ALTHOUGH DIFFERING FROM THE IDEA OF EQUALITY
YOU CONCEIVED AND ATTAINED THAT IDEA
VERY TRUE HE SAID
WHICH MIGHT BE LIKE OR MIGHT BE UNLIKE THEM
YES
BUT THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHENEVER FROM SEEING ONE THING YOU
CONCEIVED ANOTHER WHETHER LIKE OR UNLIKE THERE MUST SURELY HAVE BEEN
AN ACT OF RECOLLECTION
VERY TRUE
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY OF EQUAL PORTIONS OF WOOD AND STONE OR OTHER
MATERIAL EQUALS AND WHAT IS THE IMPRESSION PRODUCED BY THEM ARE THEY
EQUALS IN THE SAME SENSE IN WHICH ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IS EQUAL OR DO THEY
FALL SHORT OF THIS PERFECT EQUALITY IN A MEASURE
YES HE SAID IN A VERY GREAT MEASURE TOO
AND MUST WE NOT ALLOW THAT WHEN I OR ANY ONE LOOKING AT ANY OBJECT
OBSERVES THAT THE THING WHICH HE SEES AIMS AT BEING SOME OTHER THING
BUT FALLS SHORT OF AND CANNOT BE THAT OTHER THING BUT IS INFERIOR HE
WHO MAKES THIS OBSERVATION MUST HAVE HAD A PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THAT TO
WHICH THE OTHER ALTHOUGH SIMILAR WAS INFERIOR
CERTAINLY
AND HAS NOT THIS BEEN OUR OWN CASE IN THE MATTER OF EQUALS AND OF
ABSOLUTE EQUALITY
PRECISELY
THEN WE MUST HAVE KNOWN EQUALITY PREVIOUSLY TO THE TIME WHEN WE FIRST
SAW THE MATERIAL EQUALS AND REFLECTED THAT ALL THESE APPARENT EQUALS
STRIVE TO ATTAIN ABSOLUTE EQUALITY BUT FALL SHORT OF IT
VERY TRUE
AND WE RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THIS ABSOLUTE EQUALITY HAS ONLY BEEN KNOWN
AND CAN ONLY BE KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT OR TOUCH OR OF SOME
OTHER OF THE SENSES WHICH ARE ALL ALIKE IN THIS RESPECT
YES SOCRATES AS FAR AS THE ARGUMENT IS CONCERNED ONE OF THEM IS THE
SAME AS THE OTHER
FROM THE SENSES THEN IS DERIVED THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ALL SENSIBLE THINGS
AIM AT AN ABSOLUTE EQUALITY OF WHICH THEY FALL SHORT
YES
THEN BEFORE WE BEGAN TO SEE OR HEAR OR PERCEIVE IN ANY WAY WE MUST HAVE
HAD A KNOWLEDGE OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY OR WE COULD NOT HAVE REFERRED TO
THAT STANDARD THE EQUALS WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM THE SENSES FOR TO THAT
THEY ALL ASPIRE AND OF THAT THEY FALL SHORT
NO OTHER INFERENCE CAN BE DRAWN FROM THE PREVIOUS STATEMENTS
AND DID WE NOT SEE AND HEAR AND HAVE THE USE OF OUR OTHER SENSES AS SOON
AS WE WERE BORN
CERTAINLY
THEN WE MUST HAVE ACQUIRED THE KNOWLEDGE OF EQUALITY AT SOME PREVIOUS
TIME
YES
THAT IS TO SAY BEFORE WE WERE BORN I SUPPOSE
TRUE
AND IF WE ACQUIRED THIS KNOWLEDGE BEFORE WE WERE BORN AND WERE BORN
HAVING THE USE OF IT THEN WE ALSO KNEW BEFORE WE WERE BORN AND AT THE
INSTANT OF BIRTH NOT ONLY THE EQUAL OR THE GREATER OR THE LESS BUT ALL
OTHER IDEAS FOR WE ARE NOT SPEAKING ONLY OF EQUALITY BUT OF BEAUTY
GOODNESS JUSTICE HOLINESS AND OF ALL WHICH WE STAMP WITH THE NAME OF
ESSENCE IN THE DIALECTICAL PROCESS BOTH WHEN WE ASK AND WHEN WE ANSWER
QUESTIONS
OF ALL THIS WE MAY CERTAINLY AFFIRM THAT WE ACQUIRED THE
KNOWLEDGE BEFORE BIRTH
WE MAY
BUT IF AFTER HAVING ACQUIRED WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN WHAT IN EACH CASE
WE ACQUIRED THEN WE MUST ALWAYS HAVE COME INTO LIFE HAVING KNOWLEDGE
AND SHALL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO KNOW AS LONG AS LIFE LASTS FOR KNOWING
IS THE ACQUIRING AND RETAINING KNOWLEDGE AND NOT FORGETTING
IS NOT
FORGETTING SIMMIAS JUST THE LOSING OF KNOWLEDGE
QUITE TRUE SOCRATES
BUT IF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH WE ACQUIRED BEFORE BIRTH WAS LOST BY US AT
BIRTH AND IF AFTERWARDS BY THE USE OF THE SENSES WE RECOVERED WHAT
WE PREVIOUSLY KNEW WILL NOT THE PROCESS WHICH WE CALL LEARNING BE A
RECOVERING OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS NATURAL TO US AND MAY NOT THIS BE
RIGHTLY TERMED RECOLLECTION
VERY TRUE
SO MUCH IS CLEAR THAT WHEN WE PERCEIVE SOMETHING EITHER BY THE HELP OF
SIGHT OR HEARING OR SOME OTHER SENSE FROM THAT PERCEPTION WE ARE
ABLE TO OBTAIN A NOTION OF SOME OTHER THING LIKE OR UNLIKE WHICH IS
ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN
WHENCE AS I WAS SAYING ONE
OF TWO ALTERNATIVES FOLLOWS EITHER WE HAD THIS KNOWLEDGE AT BIRTH AND
CONTINUED TO KNOW THROUGH LIFE OR AFTER BIRTH THOSE WHO ARE SAID TO
LEARN ONLY REMEMBER AND LEARNING IS SIMPLY RECOLLECTION
YES THAT IS QUITE TRUE SOCRATES
AND WHICH ALTERNATIVE SIMMIAS DO YOU PREFER HAD WE THE KNOWLEDGE AT
OUR BIRTH OR DID WE RECOLLECT THE THINGS WHICH WE KNEW PREVIOUSLY TO
OUR BIRTH
I CANNOT DECIDE AT THE MOMENT
AT ANY RATE YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER HE WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE WILL OR WILL NOT
BE ABLE TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE WHAT DO YOU SAY
CERTAINLY HE WILL
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT EVERY MAN IS ABLE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THESE VERY
MATTERS ABOUT WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING
WOULD THAT THEY COULD SOCRATES BUT I RATHER FEAR THAT TO MORROW AT
THIS TIME THERE WILL NO LONGER BE ANY ONE ALIVE WHO IS ABLE TO GIVE AN
ACCOUNT OF THEM SUCH AS OUGHT TO BE GIVEN
THEN YOU ARE NOT OF OPINION SIMMIAS THAT ALL MEN KNOW THESE THINGS
CERTAINLY NOT
THEY ARE IN PROCESS OF RECOLLECTING THAT WHICH THEY LEARNED BEFORE
CERTAINLY
BUT WHEN DID OUR SOULS ACQUIRE THIS KNOWLEDGE NOT SINCE WE WERE BORN
AS MEN
CERTAINLY NOT
AND THEREFORE PREVIOUSLY
YES
THEN SIMMIAS OUR SOULS MUST ALSO HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT BODIES BEFORE
THEY WERE IN THE FORM OF MAN AND MUST HAVE HAD INTELLIGENCE
UNLESS INDEED YOU SUPPOSE SOCRATES THAT THESE NOTIONS ARE GIVEN US AT
THE VERY MOMENT OF BIRTH FOR THIS IS THE ONLY TIME WHICH REMAINS
YES MY FRIEND BUT IF SO WHEN DO WE LOSE THEM FOR THEY ARE NOT IN
US WHEN WE ARE BORN THAT IS ADMITTED
DO WE LOSE THEM AT THE MOMENT OF
RECEIVING THEM OR IF NOT AT WHAT OTHER TIME
NO SOCRATES I PERCEIVE THAT I WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY TALKING NONSENSE
THEN MAY WE NOT SAY SIMMIAS THAT IF AS WE ARE ALWAYS REPEATING THERE
IS AN ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AND GOODNESS AND AN ABSOLUTE ESSENCE OF ALL
THINGS AND IF TO THIS WHICH IS NOW DISCOVERED TO HAVE EXISTED IN OUR
FORMER STATE WE REFER ALL OUR SENSATIONS AND WITH THIS COMPARE THEM
FINDING THESE IDEAS TO BE PRE EXISTENT AND OUR INBORN POSSESSION THEN
OUR SOULS MUST HAVE HAD A PRIOR EXISTENCE BUT IF NOT THERE WOULD BE
NO FORCE IN THE ARGUMENT THERE IS THE SAME PROOF THAT THESE IDEAS MUST
HAVE EXISTED BEFORE WE WERE BORN AS THAT OUR SOULS EXISTED BEFORE WE
WERE BORN AND IF NOT THE IDEAS THEN NOT THE SOULS
YES SOCRATES I AM CONVINCED THAT THERE IS PRECISELY THE SAME NECESSITY
FOR THE ONE AS FOR THE OTHER AND THE ARGUMENT RETREATS SUCCESSFULLY
TO THE POSITION THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL BEFORE BIRTH CANNOT BE
SEPARATED FROM THE EXISTENCE OF THE ESSENCE OF WHICH YOU SPEAK
FOR
THERE IS NOTHING WHICH TO MY MIND IS SO PATENT AS THAT BEAUTY GOODNESS
AND THE OTHER NOTIONS OF WHICH YOU WERE JUST NOW SPEAKING HAVE A MOST
REAL AND ABSOLUTE EXISTENCE AND I AM SATISFIED WITH THE PROOF
WELL BUT IS CEBES EQUALLY SATISFIED FOR I MUST CONVINCE HIM TOO
I THINK SAID SIMMIAS THAT CEBES IS SATISFIED ALTHOUGH HE IS THE MOST
INCREDULOUS OF MORTALS YET I BELIEVE THAT HE IS SUFFICIENTLY CONVINCED
OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL BEFORE BIRTH
BUT THAT AFTER DEATH THE SOUL
WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST IS NOT YET PROVEN EVEN TO MY OWN SATISFACTION
I CANNOT GET RID OF THE FEELING OF THE MANY TO WHICH CEBES WAS
REFERRING THE FEELING THAT WHEN THE MAN DIES THE SOUL WILL BE
DISPERSED AND THAT THIS MAY BE THE EXTINCTION OF HER
FOR ADMITTING
THAT SHE MAY HAVE BEEN BORN ELSEWHERE AND FRAMED OUT OF OTHER ELEMENTS
AND WAS IN EXISTENCE BEFORE ENTERING THE HUMAN BODY WHY AFTER HAVING
ENTERED IN AND GONE OUT AGAIN MAY SHE NOT HERSELF BE DESTROYED AND COME
TO AN END
VERY TRUE SIMMIAS SAID CEBES ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WAS REQUIRED HAS BEEN
PROVEN TO WIT THAT OUR SOULS EXISTED BEFORE WE WERE BORN THAT THE
SOUL WILL EXIST AFTER DEATH AS WELL AS BEFORE BIRTH IS THE OTHER HALF OF
WHICH THE PROOF IS STILL WANTING AND HAS TO BE SUPPLIED WHEN THAT IS
GIVEN THE DEMONSTRATION WILL BE COMPLETE
BUT THAT PROOF SIMMIAS AND CEBES HAS BEEN ALREADY GIVEN SAID
SOCRATES IF YOU PUT THE TWO ARGUMENTS TOGETHER I MEAN THIS AND THE
FORMER ONE IN WHICH WE ADMITTED THAT EVERYTHING LIVING IS BORN OF THE
DEAD
FOR IF THE SOUL EXISTS BEFORE BIRTH AND IN COMING TO LIFE AND
BEING BORN CAN BE BORN ONLY FROM DEATH AND DYING MUST SHE NOT AFTER
DEATH CONTINUE TO EXIST SINCE SHE HAS TO BE BORN AGAIN SURELY THE
PROOF WHICH YOU DESIRE HAS BEEN ALREADY FURNISHED
STILL I SUSPECT
THAT YOU AND SIMMIAS WOULD BE GLAD TO PROBE THE ARGUMENT FURTHER
LIKE
CHILDREN YOU ARE HAUNTED WITH A FEAR THAT WHEN THE SOUL LEAVES THE
BODY THE WIND MAY REALLY BLOW HER AWAY AND SCATTER HER ESPECIALLY IF A
MAN SHOULD HAPPEN TO DIE IN A GREAT STORM AND NOT WHEN THE SKY IS CALM
CEBES ANSWERED WITH A SMILE THEN SOCRATES YOU MUST ARGUE US OUT OF
OUR FEARS AND YET STRICTLY SPEAKING THEY ARE NOT OUR FEARS BUT THERE
IS A CHILD WITHIN US TO WHOM DEATH IS A SORT OF HOBGOBLIN HIM TOO WE
MUST PERSUADE NOT TO BE AFRAID WHEN HE IS ALONE IN THE DARK
SOCRATES SAID LET THE VOICE OF THE CHARMER BE APPLIED DAILY UNTIL YOU
HAVE CHARMED AWAY THE FEAR
AND WHERE SHALL WE FIND A GOOD CHARMER OF OUR FEARS SOCRATES WHEN YOU
ARE GONE
HELLAS HE REPLIED IS A LARGE PLACE CEBES AND HAS MANY GOOD MEN AND
THERE ARE BARBAROUS RACES NOT A FEW SEEK FOR HIM AMONG THEM ALL FAR
AND WIDE SPARING NEITHER PAINS NOR MONEY FOR THERE IS NO BETTER WAY
OF SPENDING YOUR MONEY
AND YOU MUST SEEK AMONG YOURSELVES TOO FOR YOU
WILL NOT FIND OTHERS BETTER ABLE TO MAKE THE SEARCH
THE SEARCH REPLIED CEBES SHALL CERTAINLY BE MADE
AND NOW IF
YOU PLEASE LET US RETURN TO THE POINT OF THE ARGUMENT AT WHICH WE
DIGRESSED
BY ALL MEANS REPLIED SOCRATES WHAT ELSE SHOULD I PLEASE
VERY GOOD
MUST WE NOT SAID SOCRATES ASK OURSELVES WHAT THAT IS WHICH AS WE
IMAGINE IS LIABLE TO BE SCATTERED AND ABOUT WHICH WE FEAR AND WHAT
AGAIN IS THAT ABOUT WHICH WE HAVE NO FEAR AND THEN WE MAY PROCEED
FURTHER TO ENQUIRE WHETHER THAT WHICH SUFFERS DISPERSION IS OR IS NOT
OF THE NATURE OF SOUL OUR HOPES AND FEARS AS TO OUR OWN SOULS WILL TURN
UPON THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS
VERY TRUE HE SAID
NOW THE COMPOUND OR COMPOSITE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE NATURALLY CAPABLE
AS OF BEING COMPOUNDED SO ALSO OF BEING DISSOLVED BUT THAT WHICH IS
UNCOMPOUNDED AND THAT ONLY MUST BE IF ANYTHING IS INDISSOLUBLE
YES I SHOULD IMAGINE SO SAID CEBES
AND THE UNCOMPOUNDED MAY BE ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME AND UNCHANGING
WHEREAS THE COMPOUND IS ALWAYS CHANGING AND NEVER THE SAME
I AGREE HE SAID
THEN NOW LET US RETURN TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
IS THAT IDEA OR
ESSENCE WHICH IN THE DIALECTICAL PROCESS WE DEFINE AS ESSENCE OR TRUE
EXISTENCE WHETHER ESSENCE OF EQUALITY BEAUTY OR ANYTHING ELSE ARE
THESE ESSENCES I SAY LIABLE AT TIMES TO SOME DEGREE OF CHANGE OR
ARE THEY EACH OF THEM ALWAYS WHAT THEY ARE HAVING THE SAME SIMPLE
SELF EXISTENT AND UNCHANGING FORMS NOT ADMITTING OF VARIATION AT ALL
OR IN ANY WAY OR AT ANY TIME
THEY MUST BE ALWAYS THE SAME SOCRATES REPLIED CEBES
AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL WHETHER MEN OR HORSES OR
GARMENTS OR ANY OTHER THINGS WHICH ARE NAMED BY THE SAME NAMES AND MAY
BE CALLED EQUAL OR BEAUTIFUL ARE THEY ALL UNCHANGING AND THE SAME
ALWAYS OR QUITE THE REVERSE MAY THEY NOT RATHER BE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST
ALWAYS CHANGING AND HARDLY EVER THE SAME EITHER WITH THEMSELVES OR WITH
ONE ANOTHER
THE LATTER REPLIED CEBES THEY ARE ALWAYS IN A STATE OF CHANGE
AND THESE YOU CAN TOUCH AND SEE AND PERCEIVE WITH THE SENSES BUT
THE UNCHANGING THINGS YOU CAN ONLY PERCEIVE WITH THE MIND THEY ARE
INVISIBLE AND ARE NOT SEEN
THAT IS VERY TRUE HE SAID
WELL THEN ADDED SOCRATES LET US SUPPOSE THAT THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF
EXISTENCES ONE SEEN THE OTHER UNSEEN
LET US SUPPOSE THEM
THE SEEN IS THE CHANGING AND THE UNSEEN IS THE UNCHANGING
THAT MAY BE ALSO SUPPOSED
AND FURTHER IS NOT ONE PART OF US BODY ANOTHER PART SOUL
TO BE SURE
AND TO WHICH CLASS IS THE BODY MORE ALIKE AND AKIN
CLEARLY TO THE SEEN NO ONE CAN DOUBT THAT
AND IS THE SOUL SEEN OR NOT SEEN
NOT BY MAN SOCRATES
AND WHAT WE MEAN BY 'SEEN' AND 'NOT SEEN' IS THAT WHICH IS OR IS NOT
VISIBLE TO THE EYE OF MAN
YES TO THE EYE OF MAN
AND IS THE SOUL SEEN OR NOT SEEN
NOT SEEN
UNSEEN THEN
YES
THEN THE SOUL IS MORE LIKE TO THE UNSEEN AND THE BODY TO THE SEEN
THAT FOLLOWS NECESSARILY SOCRATES
AND WERE WE NOT SAYING LONG AGO THAT THE SOUL WHEN USING THE BODY AS AN
INSTRUMENT OF PERCEPTION THAT IS TO SAY WHEN USING THE SENSE OF SIGHT
OR HEARING OR SOME OTHER SENSE FOR THE MEANING OF PERCEIVING THROUGH
THE BODY IS PERCEIVING THROUGH THE SENSES WERE WE NOT SAYING THAT THE
SOUL TOO IS THEN DRAGGED BY THE BODY INTO THE REGION OF THE CHANGEABLE
AND WANDERS AND IS CONFUSED THE WORLD SPINS ROUND HER AND SHE IS LIKE
A DRUNKARD WHEN SHE TOUCHES CHANGE
VERY TRUE
BUT WHEN RETURNING INTO HERSELF SHE REFLECTS THEN SHE PASSES INTO THE
OTHER WORLD THE REGION OF PURITY AND ETERNITY AND IMMORTALITY AND
UNCHANGEABLENESS WHICH ARE HER KINDRED AND WITH THEM SHE EVER LIVES
WHEN SHE IS BY HERSELF AND IS NOT LET OR HINDERED THEN SHE CEASES
FROM HER ERRING WAYS AND BEING IN COMMUNION WITH THE UNCHANGING IS
UNCHANGING
AND THIS STATE OF THE SOUL IS CALLED WISDOM
THAT IS WELL AND TRULY SAID SOCRATES HE REPLIED
AND TO WHICH CLASS IS THE SOUL MORE NEARLY ALIKE AND AKIN AS FAR AS MAY
BE INFERRED FROM THIS ARGUMENT AS WELL AS FROM THE PRECEDING ONE
I THINK SOCRATES THAT IN THE OPINION OF EVERY ONE WHO FOLLOWS THE
ARGUMENT THE SOUL WILL BE INFINITELY MORE LIKE THE UNCHANGEABLE EVEN
THE MOST STUPID PERSON WILL NOT DENY THAT
AND THE BODY IS MORE LIKE THE CHANGING
YES
YET ONCE MORE CONSIDER THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT WHEN THE SOUL AND
THE BODY ARE UNITED THEN NATURE ORDERS THE SOUL TO RULE AND GOVERN AND
THE BODY TO OBEY AND SERVE
NOW WHICH OF THESE TWO FUNCTIONS IS AKIN TO
THE DIVINE AND WHICH TO THE MORTAL DOES NOT THE DIVINE APPEAR TO YOU
TO BE THAT WHICH NATURALLY ORDERS AND RULES AND THE MORTAL TO BE THAT
WHICH IS SUBJECT AND SERVANT
TRUE
AND WHICH DOES THE SOUL RESEMBLE
THE SOUL RESEMBLES THE DIVINE AND THE BODY THE MORTAL THERE CAN BE NO
DOUBT OF THAT SOCRATES
THEN REFLECT CEBES OF ALL WHICH HAS BEEN SAID IS NOT THIS THE
CONCLUSION THAT THE SOUL IS IN THE VERY LIKENESS OF THE DIVINE
AND IMMORTAL AND INTELLECTUAL AND UNIFORM AND INDISSOLUBLE AND
UNCHANGEABLE AND THAT THE BODY IS IN THE VERY LIKENESS OF THE HUMAN
AND MORTAL AND UNINTELLECTUAL AND MULTIFORM AND DISSOLUBLE AND
CHANGEABLE
CAN THIS MY DEAR CEBES BE DENIED
IT CANNOT
BUT IF IT BE TRUE THEN IS NOT THE BODY LIABLE TO SPEEDY DISSOLUTION
AND IS NOT THE SOUL ALMOST OR ALTOGETHER INDISSOLUBLE
CERTAINLY
AND DO YOU FURTHER OBSERVE THAT AFTER A MAN IS DEAD THE BODY OR
VISIBLE PART OF HIM WHICH IS LYING IN THE VISIBLE WORLD AND IS
CALLED A CORPSE AND WOULD NATURALLY BE DISSOLVED AND DECOMPOSED AND
DISSIPATED IS NOT DISSOLVED OR DECOMPOSED AT ONCE BUT MAY REMAIN FOR A
FOR SOME TIME NAY EVEN FOR A LONG TIME IF THE CONSTITUTION BE SOUND AT
THE TIME OF DEATH AND THE SEASON OF THE YEAR FAVOURABLE FOR THE BODY
WHEN SHRUNK AND EMBALMED AS THE MANNER IS IN EGYPT MAY REMAIN ALMOST
ENTIRE THROUGH INFINITE AGES AND EVEN IN DECAY THERE ARE STILL
SOME PORTIONS SUCH AS THE BONES AND LIGAMENTS WHICH ARE PRACTICALLY
INDESTRUCTIBLE DO YOU AGREE
YES
AND IS IT LIKELY THAT THE SOUL WHICH IS INVISIBLE IN PASSING TO THE
PLACE OF THE TRUE HADES WHICH LIKE HER IS INVISIBLE AND PURE AND
NOBLE AND ON HER WAY TO THE GOOD AND WISE GOD WHITHER IF GOD WILL MY
SOUL IS ALSO SOON TO GO THAT THE SOUL I REPEAT IF THIS BE HER NATURE
AND ORIGIN WILL BE BLOWN AWAY AND DESTROYED IMMEDIATELY ON QUITTING THE
BODY AS THE MANY SAY THAT CAN NEVER BE MY DEAR SIMMIAS AND CEBES
THE TRUTH RATHER IS THAT THE SOUL WHICH IS PURE AT DEPARTING AND DRAWS
AFTER HER NO BODILY TAINT HAVING NEVER VOLUNTARILY DURING LIFE HAD
CONNECTION WITH THE BODY WHICH SHE IS EVER AVOIDING HERSELF GATHERED
INTO HERSELF AND MAKING SUCH ABSTRACTION HER PERPETUAL STUDY WHICH
MEANS THAT SHE HAS BEEN A TRUE DISCIPLE OF PHILOSOPHY AND THEREFORE
HAS IN FACT BEEN ALWAYS ENGAGED IN THE PRACTICE OF DYING FOR IS NOT
PHILOSOPHY THE PRACTICE OF DEATH
CERTAINLY
THAT SOUL I SAY HERSELF INVISIBLE DEPARTS TO THE INVISIBLE WORLD TO
THE DIVINE AND IMMORTAL AND RATIONAL THITHER ARRIVING SHE IS SECURE OF
BLISS AND IS RELEASED FROM THE ERROR AND FOLLY OF MEN THEIR FEARS AND
WILD PASSIONS AND ALL OTHER HUMAN ILLS AND FOR EVER DWELLS AS THEY SAY
OF THE INITIATED IN COMPANY WITH THE GODS COMPARE APOL
IS NOT THIS
TRUE CEBES
YES SAID CEBES BEYOND A DOUBT
BUT THE SOUL WHICH HAS BEEN POLLUTED AND IS IMPURE AT THE TIME OF HER
DEPARTURE AND IS THE COMPANION AND SERVANT OF THE BODY ALWAYS AND IS
IN LOVE WITH AND FASCINATED BY THE BODY AND BY THE DESIRES AND PLEASURES
OF THE BODY UNTIL SHE IS LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE TRUTH ONLY EXISTS IN
A BODILY FORM WHICH A MAN MAY TOUCH AND SEE AND TASTE AND USE FOR THE
PURPOSES OF HIS LUSTS THE SOUL I MEAN ACCUSTOMED TO HATE AND FEAR
AND AVOID THE INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE WHICH TO THE BODILY EYE IS DARK
AND INVISIBLE AND CAN BE ATTAINED ONLY BY PHILOSOPHY DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT SUCH A SOUL WILL DEPART PURE AND UNALLOYED
IMPOSSIBLE HE REPLIED
SHE IS HELD FAST BY THE CORPOREAL WHICH THE CONTINUAL ASSOCIATION AND
CONSTANT CARE OF THE BODY HAVE WROUGHT INTO HER NATURE
VERY TRUE
AND THIS CORPOREAL ELEMENT MY FRIEND IS HEAVY AND WEIGHTY AND EARTHY
AND IS THAT ELEMENT OF SIGHT BY WHICH A SOUL IS DEPRESSED AND DRAGGED
DOWN AGAIN INTO THE VISIBLE WORLD BECAUSE SHE IS AFRAID OF THE
INVISIBLE AND OF THE WORLD BELOW PROWLING ABOUT TOMBS AND SEPULCHRES
NEAR WHICH AS THEY TELL US ARE SEEN CERTAIN GHOSTLY APPARITIONS
OF SOULS WHICH HAVE NOT DEPARTED PURE BUT ARE CLOYED WITH SIGHT AND
THEREFORE VISIBLE
COMPARE MILTON COMUS
'BUT WHEN LUST
BY UNCHASTE LOOKS LOOSE GESTURES AND FOUL TALK
BUT MOST BY LEWD AND LAVISH ACT OF SIN
LETS IN DEFILEMENT TO THE INWARD PARTS
THE SOUL GROWS CLOTTED BY CONTAGION
IMBODIES AND IMBRUTES TILL SHE QUITE LOSE
THE DIVINE PROPERTY OF HER FIRST BEING
SUCH ARE THOSE THICK AND GLOOMY SHADOWS DAMP
OFT SEEN IN CHARNEL VAULTS AND SEPULCHRES
LINGERING AND SITTING BY A NEW MADE GRAVE
AS LOATH TO LEAVE THE BODY THAT IT LOV'D
AND LINKED ITSELF BY CARNAL SENSUALITY
TO A DEGENERATE AND DEGRADED STATE
THAT IS VERY LIKELY SOCRATES
YES THAT IS VERY LIKELY CEBES AND THESE MUST BE THE SOULS NOT OF THE
GOOD BUT OF THE EVIL WHICH ARE COMPELLED TO WANDER ABOUT SUCH PLACES
IN PAYMENT OF THE PENALTY OF THEIR FORMER EVIL WAY OF LIFE AND THEY
CONTINUE TO WANDER UNTIL THROUGH THE CRAVING AFTER THE CORPOREAL WHICH
NEVER LEAVES THEM THEY ARE IMPRISONED FINALLY IN ANOTHER BODY
AND THEY
MAY BE SUPPOSED TO FIND THEIR PRISONS IN THE SAME NATURES WHICH THEY
HAVE HAD IN THEIR FORMER LIVES
WHAT NATURES DO YOU MEAN SOCRATES
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT MEN WHO HAVE FOLLOWED AFTER GLUTTONY AND
WANTONNESS AND DRUNKENNESS AND HAVE HAD NO THOUGHT OF AVOIDING THEM
WOULD PASS INTO ASSES AND ANIMALS OF THAT SORT
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I THINK SUCH AN OPINION TO BE EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
AND THOSE WHO HAVE CHOSEN THE PORTION OF INJUSTICE AND TYRANNY AND
VIOLENCE WILL PASS INTO WOLVES OR INTO HAWKS AND KITES WHITHER ELSE
CAN WE SUPPOSE THEM TO GO
YES SAID CEBES WITH SUCH NATURES BEYOND QUESTION
AND THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY HE SAID IN ASSIGNING TO ALL OF THEM PLACES
ANSWERING TO THEIR SEVERAL NATURES AND PROPENSITIES
THERE IS NOT HE SAID
SOME ARE HAPPIER THAN OTHERS AND THE HAPPIEST BOTH IN THEMSELVES AND
IN THE PLACE TO WHICH THEY GO ARE THOSE WHO HAVE PRACTISED THE CIVIL AND
SOCIAL VIRTUES WHICH ARE CALLED TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE AND ARE ACQUIRED
BY HABIT AND ATTENTION WITHOUT PHILOSOPHY AND MIND
COMPARE REPUBLIC
WHY ARE THEY THE HAPPIEST
BECAUSE THEY MAY BE EXPECTED TO PASS INTO SOME GENTLE AND SOCIAL KIND
WHICH IS LIKE THEIR OWN SUCH AS BEES OR WASPS OR ANTS OR BACK AGAIN
INTO THE FORM OF MAN AND JUST AND MODERATE MEN MAY BE SUPPOSED TO
SPRING FROM THEM
VERY LIKELY
NO ONE WHO HAS NOT STUDIED PHILOSOPHY AND WHO IS NOT ENTIRELY PURE AT
THE TIME OF HIS DEPARTURE IS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE COMPANY OF THE GODS
BUT THE LOVER OF KNOWLEDGE ONLY
AND THIS IS THE REASON SIMMIAS AND
CEBES WHY THE TRUE VOTARIES OF PHILOSOPHY ABSTAIN FROM ALL FLESHLY
LUSTS AND HOLD OUT AGAINST THEM AND REFUSE TO GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO
THEM NOT BECAUSE THEY FEAR POVERTY OR THE RUIN OF THEIR FAMILIES LIKE
THE LOVERS OF MONEY AND THE WORLD IN GENERAL NOR LIKE THE LOVERS OF
POWER AND HONOUR BECAUSE THEY DREAD THE DISHONOUR OR DISGRACE OF EVIL
DEEDS
NO SOCRATES THAT WOULD NOT BECOME THEM SAID CEBES
NO INDEED HE REPLIED AND THEREFORE THEY WHO HAVE ANY CARE OF THEIR
OWN SOULS AND DO NOT MERELY LIVE MOULDING AND FASHIONING THE BODY SAY
FAREWELL TO ALL THIS THEY WILL NOT WALK IN THE WAYS OF THE BLIND AND
WHEN PHILOSOPHY OFFERS THEM PURIFICATION AND RELEASE FROM EVIL THEY
FEEL THAT THEY OUGHT NOT TO RESIST HER INFLUENCE AND WHITHER SHE LEADS
THEY TURN AND FOLLOW
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOCRATES
I WILL TELL YOU HE SAID
THE LOVERS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE CONSCIOUS THAT
THE SOUL WAS SIMPLY FASTENED AND GLUED TO THE BODY UNTIL PHILOSOPHY
RECEIVED HER SHE COULD ONLY VIEW REAL EXISTENCE THROUGH THE BARS OF
A PRISON NOT IN AND THROUGH HERSELF SHE WAS WALLOWING IN THE MIRE OF
EVERY SORT OF IGNORANCE AND BY REASON OF LUST HAD BECOME THE PRINCIPAL
ACCOMPLICE IN HER OWN CAPTIVITY
THIS WAS HER ORIGINAL STATE AND
THEN AS I WAS SAYING AND AS THE LOVERS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE WELL AWARE
PHILOSOPHY SEEING HOW TERRIBLE WAS HER CONFINEMENT OF WHICH SHE WAS
TO HERSELF THE CAUSE RECEIVED AND GENTLY COMFORTED HER AND SOUGHT TO
RELEASE HER POINTING OUT THAT THE EYE AND THE EAR AND THE OTHER SENSES
ARE FULL OF DECEPTION AND PERSUADING HER TO RETIRE FROM THEM AND
ABSTAIN FROM ALL BUT THE NECESSARY USE OF THEM AND BE GATHERED UP AND
COLLECTED INTO HERSELF BIDDING HER TRUST IN HERSELF AND HER OWN PURE
APPREHENSION OF PURE EXISTENCE AND TO MISTRUST WHATEVER COMES TO HER
THROUGH OTHER CHANNELS AND IS SUBJECT TO VARIATION FOR SUCH THINGS
ARE VISIBLE AND TANGIBLE BUT WHAT SHE SEES IN HER OWN NATURE IS
INTELLIGIBLE AND INVISIBLE
AND THE SOUL OF THE TRUE PHILOSOPHER THINKS
THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO RESIST THIS DELIVERANCE AND THEREFORE ABSTAINS
FROM PLEASURES AND DESIRES AND PAINS AND FEARS AS FAR AS SHE IS
ABLE REFLECTING THAT WHEN A MAN HAS GREAT JOYS OR SORROWS OR FEARS OR
DESIRES HE SUFFERS FROM THEM NOT MERELY THE SORT OF EVIL WHICH MIGHT
BE ANTICIPATED AS FOR EXAMPLE THE LOSS OF HIS HEALTH OR PROPERTY WHICH
HE HAS SACRIFICED TO HIS LUSTS BUT AN EVIL GREATER FAR WHICH IS THE
GREATEST AND WORST OF ALL EVILS AND ONE OF WHICH HE NEVER THINKS
WHAT IS IT SOCRATES SAID CEBES
THE EVIL IS THAT WHEN THE FEELING OF PLEASURE OR PAIN IS MOST INTENSE
EVERY SOUL OF MAN IMAGINES THE OBJECTS OF THIS INTENSE FEELING TO BE
THEN PLAINEST AND TRUEST BUT THIS IS NOT SO THEY ARE REALLY THE THINGS
OF SIGHT
VERY TRUE
AND IS NOT THIS THE STATE IN WHICH THE SOUL IS MOST ENTHRALLED BY THE
BODY
HOW SO
WHY BECAUSE EACH PLEASURE AND PAIN IS A SORT OF NAIL WHICH NAILS
AND RIVETS THE SOUL TO THE BODY UNTIL SHE BECOMES LIKE THE BODY AND
BELIEVES THAT TO BE TRUE WHICH THE BODY AFFIRMS TO BE TRUE AND FROM
AGREEING WITH THE BODY AND HAVING THE SAME DELIGHTS SHE IS OBLIGED TO
HAVE THE SAME HABITS AND HAUNTS AND IS NOT LIKELY EVER TO BE PURE AT
HER DEPARTURE TO THE WORLD BELOW BUT IS ALWAYS INFECTED BY THE BODY
AND SO SHE SINKS INTO ANOTHER BODY AND THERE GERMINATES AND GROWS
AND HAS THEREFORE NO PART IN THE COMMUNION OF THE DIVINE AND PURE AND
SIMPLE
MOST TRUE SOCRATES ANSWERED CEBES
AND THIS CEBES IS THE REASON WHY THE TRUE LOVERS OF KNOWLEDGE ARE
TEMPERATE AND BRAVE AND NOT FOR THE REASON WHICH THE WORLD GIVES
CERTAINLY NOT
CERTAINLY NOT THE SOUL OF A PHILOSOPHER WILL REASON IN QUITE ANOTHER
WAY SHE WILL NOT ASK PHILOSOPHY TO RELEASE HER IN ORDER THAT WHEN
RELEASED SHE MAY DELIVER HERSELF UP AGAIN TO THE THRALDOM OF PLEASURES
AND PAINS DOING A WORK ONLY TO BE UNDONE AGAIN WEAVING INSTEAD OF
UNWEAVING HER PENELOPE'S WEB
BUT SHE WILL CALM PASSION AND FOLLOW
REASON AND DWELL IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF HER BEHOLDING THE TRUE
AND DIVINE WHICH IS NOT MATTER OF OPINION AND THENCE DERIVING
NOURISHMENT
THUS SHE SEEKS TO LIVE WHILE SHE LIVES AND AFTER DEATH SHE
HOPES TO GO TO HER OWN KINDRED AND TO THAT WHICH IS LIKE HER AND TO BE
FREED FROM HUMAN ILLS
NEVER FEAR SIMMIAS AND CEBES THAT A SOUL WHICH
HAS BEEN THUS NURTURED AND HAS HAD THESE PURSUITS WILL AT HER DEPARTURE
FROM THE BODY BE SCATTERED AND BLOWN AWAY BY THE WINDS AND BE NOWHERE
AND NOTHING
WHEN SOCRATES HAD DONE SPEAKING FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME THERE WAS
SILENCE HE HIMSELF APPEARED TO BE MEDITATING AS MOST OF US WERE ON
WHAT HAD BEEN SAID ONLY CEBES AND SIMMIAS SPOKE A FEW WORDS TO ONE
ANOTHER
AND SOCRATES OBSERVING THEM ASKED WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THE
ARGUMENT AND WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING WANTING FOR SAID HE THERE
ARE MANY POINTS STILL OPEN TO SUSPICION AND ATTACK IF ANY ONE WERE
DISPOSED TO SIFT THE MATTER THOROUGHLY
SHOULD YOU BE CONSIDERING
SOME OTHER MATTER I SAY NO MORE BUT IF YOU ARE STILL IN DOUBT DO NOT
HESITATE TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK AND LET US HAVE ANYTHING BETTER
WHICH YOU CAN SUGGEST AND IF YOU THINK THAT I CAN BE OF ANY USE ALLOW
ME TO HELP YOU
SIMMIAS SAID I MUST CONFESS SOCRATES THAT DOUBTS DID ARISE IN OUR
MINDS AND EACH OF US WAS URGING AND INCITING THE OTHER TO PUT THE
QUESTION WHICH WE WANTED TO HAVE ANSWERED AND WHICH NEITHER OF US LIKED
TO ASK FEARING THAT OUR IMPORTUNITY MIGHT BE TROUBLESOME UNDER PRESENT
AT SUCH A TIME
SOCRATES REPLIED WITH A SMILE O SIMMIAS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING I AM
NOT VERY LIKELY TO PERSUADE OTHER MEN THAT I DO NOT REGARD MY PRESENT
SITUATION AS A MISFORTUNE IF I CANNOT EVEN PERSUADE YOU THAT I AM NO
WORSE OFF NOW THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME IN MY LIFE
WILL YOU NOT ALLOW THAT
I HAVE AS MUCH OF THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY IN ME AS THE SWANS FOR THEY
WHEN THEY PERCEIVE THAT THEY MUST DIE HAVING SUNG ALL THEIR LIFE LONG
DO THEN SING MORE LUSTILY THAN EVER REJOICING IN THE THOUGHT THAT
THEY ARE ABOUT TO GO AWAY TO THE GOD WHOSE MINISTERS THEY ARE
BUT MEN
BECAUSE THEY ARE THEMSELVES AFRAID OF DEATH SLANDEROUSLY AFFIRM OF THE
SWANS THAT THEY SING A LAMENT AT THE LAST NOT CONSIDERING THAT NO BIRD
SINGS WHEN COLD OR HUNGRY OR IN PAIN NOT EVEN THE NIGHTINGALE NOR
THE SWALLOW NOR YET THE HOOPOE WHICH ARE SAID INDEED TO TUNE A LAY OF
SORROW ALTHOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE OF THEM ANY MORE THAN
OF THE SWANS
BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE SACRED TO APOLLO THEY HAVE THE GIFT
OF PROPHECY AND ANTICIPATE THE GOOD THINGS OF ANOTHER WORLD WHEREFORE
THEY SING AND REJOICE IN THAT DAY MORE THAN THEY EVER DID BEFORE
AND I
TOO BELIEVING MYSELF TO BE THE CONSECRATED SERVANT OF THE SAME GOD AND
THE FELLOW SERVANT OF THE SWANS AND THINKING THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM
MY MASTER GIFTS OF PROPHECY WHICH ARE NOT INFERIOR TO THEIRS WOULD NOT
GO OUT OF LIFE LESS MERRILY THAN THE SWANS
NEVER MIND THEN IF THIS BE
YOUR ONLY OBJECTION BUT SPEAK AND ASK ANYTHING WHICH YOU LIKE WHILE
THE ELEVEN MAGISTRATES OF ATHENS ALLOW
VERY GOOD SOCRATES SAID SIMMIAS THEN I WILL TELL YOU MY DIFFICULTY
AND CEBES WILL TELL YOU HIS
I FEEL MYSELF AND I DARESAY THAT YOU HAVE
THE SAME FEELING HOW HARD OR RATHER IMPOSSIBLE IS THE ATTAINMENT OF
ANY CERTAINTY ABOUT QUESTIONS SUCH AS THESE IN THE PRESENT LIFE
AND YET
I SHOULD DEEM HIM A COWARD WHO DID NOT PROVE WHAT IS SAID ABOUT THEM TO
THE UTTERMOST OR WHOSE HEART FAILED HIM BEFORE HE HAD EXAMINED THEM
ON EVERY SIDE
FOR HE SHOULD PERSEVERE UNTIL HE HAS ACHIEVED ONE OF TWO
THINGS EITHER HE SHOULD DISCOVER OR BE TAUGHT THE TRUTH ABOUT THEM
OR IF THIS BE IMPOSSIBLE I WOULD HAVE HIM TAKE THE BEST AND MOST
IRREFRAGABLE OF HUMAN THEORIES AND LET THIS BE THE RAFT UPON WHICH HE
SAILS THROUGH LIFE NOT WITHOUT RISK AS I ADMIT IF HE CANNOT FIND SOME
WORD OF GOD WHICH WILL MORE SURELY AND SAFELY CARRY HIM
AND NOW AS
YOU BID ME I WILL VENTURE TO QUESTION YOU AND THEN I SHALL NOT HAVE TO
REPROACH MYSELF HEREAFTER WITH NOT HAVING SAID AT THE TIME WHAT I THINK
FOR WHEN I CONSIDER THE MATTER EITHER ALONE OR WITH CEBES THE ARGUMENT
DOES CERTAINLY APPEAR TO ME SOCRATES TO BE NOT SUFFICIENT
SOCRATES ANSWERED I DARE SAY MY FRIEND THAT YOU MAY BE RIGHT BUT I
SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW IN WHAT RESPECT THE ARGUMENT IS INSUFFICIENT
IN THIS RESPECT REPLIED SIMMIAS SUPPOSE A PERSON TO USE THE SAME
ARGUMENT ABOUT HARMONY AND THE LYRE MIGHT HE NOT SAY THAT HARMONY IS
A THING INVISIBLE INCORPOREAL PERFECT DIVINE EXISTING IN THE LYRE
WHICH IS HARMONIZED BUT THAT THE LYRE AND THE STRINGS ARE MATTER AND
MATERIAL COMPOSITE EARTHY AND AKIN TO MORTALITY AND WHEN SOME ONE
BREAKS THE LYRE OR CUTS AND RENDS THE STRINGS THEN HE WHO TAKES THIS
VIEW WOULD ARGUE AS YOU DO AND ON THE SAME ANALOGY THAT THE HARMONY
SURVIVES AND HAS NOT PERISHED YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HE WOULD SAY THAT
THE LYRE WITHOUT THE STRINGS AND THE BROKEN STRINGS THEMSELVES WHICH
ARE MORTAL REMAIN AND YET THAT THE HARMONY WHICH IS OF HEAVENLY AND
IMMORTAL NATURE AND KINDRED HAS PERISHED PERISHED BEFORE THE MORTAL
THE HARMONY MUST STILL BE SOMEWHERE AND THE WOOD AND STRINGS WILL DECAY
BEFORE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TO THAT
THE THOUGHT SOCRATES MUST HAVE
OCCURRED TO YOUR OWN MIND THAT SUCH IS OUR CONCEPTION OF THE SOUL
AND THAT WHEN THE BODY IS IN A MANNER STRUNG AND HELD TOGETHER BY THE
ELEMENTS OF HOT AND COLD WET AND DRY THEN THE SOUL IS THE HARMONY OR
DUE PROPORTIONATE ADMIXTURE OF THEM
BUT IF SO WHENEVER THE STRINGS OF
THE BODY ARE UNDULY LOOSENED OR OVERSTRAINED THROUGH DISEASE OR OTHER
INJURY THEN THE SOUL THOUGH MOST DIVINE LIKE OTHER HARMONIES OF MUSIC
OR OF WORKS OF ART OF COURSE PERISHES AT ONCE ALTHOUGH THE MATERIAL
REMAINS OF THE BODY MAY LAST FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME UNTIL THEY ARE
EITHER DECAYED OR BURNT
AND IF ANY ONE MAINTAINS THAT THE SOUL BEING
THE HARMONY OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE BODY IS FIRST TO PERISH IN THAT
WHICH IS CALLED DEATH HOW SHALL WE ANSWER HIM
SOCRATES LOOKED FIXEDLY AT US AS HIS MANNER WAS AND SAID WITH A SMILE
SIMMIAS HAS REASON ON HIS SIDE AND WHY DOES NOT SOME ONE OF YOU WHO
IS BETTER ABLE THAN MYSELF ANSWER HIM FOR THERE IS FORCE IN HIS ATTACK
UPON ME
BUT PERHAPS BEFORE WE ANSWER HIM WE HAD BETTER ALSO HEAR WHAT
CEBES HAS TO SAY THAT WE MAY GAIN TIME FOR REFLECTION AND WHEN THEY
HAVE BOTH SPOKEN WE MAY EITHER ASSENT TO THEM IF THERE IS TRUTH IN
WHAT THEY SAY OR IF NOT WE WILL MAINTAIN OUR POSITION
PLEASE TO TELL
ME THEN CEBES HE SAID WHAT WAS THE DIFFICULTY WHICH TROUBLED YOU
CEBES SAID I WILL TELL YOU
MY FEELING IS THAT THE ARGUMENT IS WHERE IT
WAS AND OPEN TO THE SAME OBJECTIONS WHICH WERE URGED BEFORE FOR I AM
READY TO ADMIT THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL BEFORE ENTERING INTO
THE BODILY FORM HAS BEEN VERY INGENIOUSLY AND IF I MAY SAY SO QUITE
SUFFICIENTLY PROVEN BUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH IS STILL
IN MY JUDGMENT UNPROVEN
NOW MY OBJECTION IS NOT THE SAME AS THAT OF
SIMMIAS FOR I AM NOT DISPOSED TO DENY THAT THE SOUL IS STRONGER AND
MORE LASTING THAN THE BODY BEING OF OPINION THAT IN ALL SUCH RESPECTS
THE SOUL VERY FAR EXCELS THE BODY
WELL THEN SAYS THE ARGUMENT TO ME
WHY DO YOU REMAIN UNCONVINCED WHEN YOU SEE THAT THE WEAKER CONTINUES
IN EXISTENCE AFTER THE MAN IS DEAD WILL YOU NOT ADMIT THAT THE MORE
LASTING MUST ALSO SURVIVE DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME NOW I WILL
ASK YOU TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE OBJECTION WHICH LIKE SIMMIAS I WILL
EXPRESS IN A FIGURE IS OF ANY WEIGHT
THE ANALOGY WHICH I WILL ADDUCE
IS THAT OF AN OLD WEAVER WHO DIES AND AFTER HIS DEATH SOMEBODY
SAYS HE IS NOT DEAD HE MUST BE ALIVE SEE THERE IS THE COAT WHICH
HE HIMSELF WOVE AND WORE AND WHICH REMAINS WHOLE AND UNDECAYED
AND
THEN HE PROCEEDS TO ASK OF SOME ONE WHO IS INCREDULOUS WHETHER A MAN
LASTS LONGER OR THE COAT WHICH IS IN USE AND WEAR AND WHEN HE IS
ANSWERED THAT A MAN LASTS FAR LONGER THINKS THAT HE HAS THUS CERTAINLY
DEMONSTRATED THE SURVIVAL OF THE MAN WHO IS THE MORE LASTING BECAUSE
THE LESS LASTING REMAINS
BUT THAT SIMMIAS AS I WOULD BEG YOU TO
REMARK IS A MISTAKE ANY ONE CAN SEE THAT HE WHO TALKS THUS IS TALKING
NONSENSE
FOR THE TRUTH IS THAT THE WEAVER AFORESAID HAVING WOVEN AND
WORN MANY SUCH COATS OUTLIVED SEVERAL OF THEM AND WAS OUTLIVED BY THE
LAST BUT A MAN IS NOT THEREFORE PROVED TO BE SLIGHTER AND WEAKER THAN
A COAT
NOW THE RELATION OF THE BODY TO THE SOUL MAY BE EXPRESSED IN A
SIMILAR FIGURE AND ANY ONE MAY VERY FAIRLY SAY IN LIKE MANNER THAT THE
SOUL IS LASTING AND THE BODY WEAK AND SHORTLIVED IN COMPARISON
HE MAY
ARGUE IN LIKE MANNER THAT EVERY SOUL WEARS OUT MANY BODIES ESPECIALLY
IF A MAN LIVE MANY YEARS
WHILE HE IS ALIVE THE BODY DELIQUESCES AND
DECAYS AND THE SOUL ALWAYS WEAVES ANOTHER GARMENT AND REPAIRS THE
WASTE
BUT OF COURSE WHENEVER THE SOUL PERISHES SHE MUST HAVE ON HER
LAST GARMENT AND THIS WILL SURVIVE HER AND THEN AT LENGTH WHEN
THE SOUL IS DEAD THE BODY WILL SHOW ITS NATIVE WEAKNESS AND QUICKLY
DECOMPOSE AND PASS AWAY
I WOULD THEREFORE RATHER NOT RELY ON THE
ARGUMENT FROM SUPERIOR STRENGTH TO PROVE THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF THE
SOUL AFTER DEATH
FOR GRANTING EVEN MORE THAN YOU AFFIRM TO BE POSSIBLE
AND ACKNOWLEDGING NOT ONLY THAT THE SOUL EXISTED BEFORE BIRTH BUT ALSO
THAT THE SOULS OF SOME EXIST AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST AFTER DEATH
AND WILL BE BORN AND DIE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THAT THERE IS A
NATURAL STRENGTH IN THE SOUL WHICH WILL HOLD OUT AND BE BORN MANY
TIMES NEVERTHELESS WE MAY BE STILL INCLINED TO THINK THAT SHE WILL
WEARY IN THE LABOURS OF SUCCESSIVE BIRTHS AND MAY AT LAST SUCCUMB IN
ONE OF HER DEATHS AND UTTERLY PERISH AND THIS DEATH AND DISSOLUTION OF
THE BODY WHICH BRINGS DESTRUCTION TO THE SOUL MAY BE UNKNOWN TO ANY OF
US FOR NO ONE OF US CAN HAVE HAD ANY EXPERIENCE OF IT AND IF SO
THEN I MAINTAIN THAT HE WHO IS CONFIDENT ABOUT DEATH HAS BUT A FOOLISH
CONFIDENCE UNLESS HE IS ABLE TO PROVE THAT THE SOUL IS ALTOGETHER
IMMORTAL AND IMPERISHABLE
BUT IF HE CANNOT PROVE THE SOUL'S
IMMORTALITY HE WHO IS ABOUT TO DIE WILL ALWAYS HAVE REASON TO FEAR THAT
WHEN THE BODY IS DISUNITED THE SOUL ALSO MAY UTTERLY PERISH
ALL OF US AS WE AFTERWARDS REMARKED TO ONE ANOTHER HAD AN UNPLEASANT
FEELING AT HEARING WHAT THEY SAID
WHEN WE HAD BEEN SO FIRMLY CONVINCED
BEFORE NOW TO HAVE OUR FAITH SHAKEN SEEMED TO INTRODUCE A CONFUSION AND
UNCERTAINTY NOT ONLY INTO THE PREVIOUS ARGUMENT BUT INTO ANY FUTURE
ONE EITHER WE WERE INCAPABLE OF FORMING A JUDGMENT OR THERE WERE NO
GROUNDS OF BELIEF
ECHECRATES THERE I FEEL WITH YOU BY HEAVEN I DO PHAEDO AND WHEN YOU
WERE SPEAKING I WAS BEGINNING TO ASK MYSELF THE SAME QUESTION WHAT
ARGUMENT CAN I EVER TRUST AGAIN FOR WHAT COULD BE MORE CONVINCING THAN
THE ARGUMENT OF SOCRATES WHICH HAS NOW FALLEN INTO DISCREDIT THAT
THE SOUL IS A HARMONY IS A DOCTRINE WHICH HAS ALWAYS HAD A WONDERFUL
ATTRACTION FOR ME AND WHEN MENTIONED CAME BACK TO ME AT ONCE AS MY
OWN ORIGINAL CONVICTION
AND NOW I MUST BEGIN AGAIN AND FIND ANOTHER
ARGUMENT WHICH WILL ASSURE ME THAT WHEN THE MAN IS DEAD THE SOUL
SURVIVES
TELL ME I IMPLORE YOU HOW DID SOCRATES PROCEED DID HE
APPEAR TO SHARE THE UNPLEASANT FEELING WHICH YOU MENTION OR DID HE
CALMLY MEET THE ATTACK AND DID HE ANSWER FORCIBLY OR FEEBLY NARRATE
WHAT PASSED AS EXACTLY AS YOU CAN
PHAEDO OFTEN ECHECRATES I HAVE WONDERED AT SOCRATES BUT NEVER MORE
THAN ON THAT OCCASION
THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER WAS NOTHING
BUT WHAT ASTONISHED ME WAS FIRST THE GENTLE AND PLEASANT AND APPROVING
MANNER IN WHICH HE RECEIVED THE WORDS OF THE YOUNG MEN AND THEN HIS
QUICK SENSE OF THE WOUND WHICH HAD BEEN INFLICTED BY THE ARGUMENT AND
THE READINESS WITH WHICH HE HEALED IT
HE MIGHT BE COMPARED TO A GENERAL
RALLYING HIS DEFEATED AND BROKEN ARMY URGING THEM TO ACCOMPANY HIM AND
RETURN TO THE FIELD OF ARGUMENT
ECHECRATES WHAT FOLLOWED
PHAEDO YOU SHALL HEAR FOR I WAS CLOSE TO HIM ON HIS RIGHT HAND SEATED
ON A SORT OF STOOL AND HE ON A COUCH WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL HIGHER
HE STROKED MY HEAD AND PRESSED THE HAIR UPON MY NECK HE HAD A WAY OF
PLAYING WITH MY HAIR AND THEN HE SAID TO MORROW PHAEDO I SUPPOSE
THAT THESE FAIR LOCKS OF YOURS WILL BE SEVERED
YES SOCRATES I SUPPOSE THAT THEY WILL I REPLIED
NOT SO IF YOU WILL TAKE MY ADVICE
WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THEM I SAID
TO DAY HE REPLIED AND NOT TO MORROW IF THIS ARGUMENT DIES AND WE
CANNOT BRING IT TO LIFE AGAIN YOU AND I WILL BOTH SHAVE OUR LOCKS AND
IF I WERE YOU AND THE ARGUMENT GOT AWAY FROM ME AND I COULD NOT HOLD
MY GROUND AGAINST SIMMIAS AND CEBES I WOULD MYSELF TAKE AN OATH LIKE
THE ARGIVES NOT TO WEAR HAIR ANY MORE UNTIL I HAD RENEWED THE CONFLICT
AND DEFEATED THEM
YES I SAID BUT HERACLES HIMSELF IS SAID NOT TO BE A MATCH FOR TWO
SUMMON ME THEN HE SAID AND I WILL BE YOUR IOLAUS UNTIL THE SUN GOES
DOWN
I SUMMON YOU RATHER I REJOINED NOT AS HERACLES SUMMONING IOLAUS BUT
AS IOLAUS MIGHT SUMMON HERACLES
THAT WILL DO AS WELL HE SAID
BUT FIRST LET US TAKE CARE THAT WE AVOID
A DANGER
OF WHAT NATURE I SAID
LEST WE BECOME MISOLOGISTS HE REPLIED NO WORSE THING CAN HAPPEN TO A
MAN THAN THIS
FOR AS THERE ARE MISANTHROPISTS OR HATERS OF MEN THERE
ARE ALSO MISOLOGISTS OR HATERS OF IDEAS AND BOTH SPRING FROM THE SAME
CAUSE WHICH IS IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD
MISANTHROPY ARISES OUT OF THE
TOO GREAT CONFIDENCE OF INEXPERIENCE YOU TRUST A MAN AND THINK HIM
ALTOGETHER TRUE AND SOUND AND FAITHFUL AND THEN IN A LITTLE WHILE HE
TURNS OUT TO BE FALSE AND KNAVISH AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND
WHEN THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES TO A MAN ESPECIALLY WHEN IT
HAPPENS AMONG THOSE WHOM HE DEEMS TO BE HIS OWN MOST TRUSTED AND
FAMILIAR FRIENDS AND HE HAS OFTEN QUARRELED WITH THEM HE AT LAST HATES
ALL MEN AND BELIEVES THAT NO ONE HAS ANY GOOD IN HIM AT ALL
YOU MUST
HAVE OBSERVED THIS TRAIT OF CHARACTER
I HAVE
AND IS NOT THE FEELING DISCREDITABLE IS IT NOT OBVIOUS THAT SUCH AN
ONE HAVING TO DEAL WITH OTHER MEN WAS CLEARLY WITHOUT ANY EXPERIENCE OF
HUMAN NATURE FOR EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE TAUGHT HIM THE TRUE STATE OF
THE CASE THAT FEW ARE THE GOOD AND FEW THE EVIL AND THAT THE GREAT
MAJORITY ARE IN THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THEM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SAID
I MEAN HE REPLIED AS YOU MIGHT SAY OF THE VERY LARGE AND VERY SMALL
THAT NOTHING IS MORE UNCOMMON THAN A VERY LARGE OR VERY SMALL MAN AND
THIS APPLIES GENERALLY TO ALL EXTREMES WHETHER OF GREAT AND SMALL OR
SWIFT AND SLOW OR FAIR AND FOUL OR BLACK AND WHITE AND WHETHER
THE INSTANCES YOU SELECT BE MEN OR DOGS OR ANYTHING ELSE FEW ARE THE
EXTREMES BUT MANY ARE IN THE MEAN BETWEEN THEM
DID YOU NEVER OBSERVE
THIS
YES I SAID I HAVE
AND DO YOU NOT IMAGINE HE SAID THAT IF THERE WERE A COMPETITION IN
EVIL THE WORST WOULD BE FOUND TO BE VERY FEW
YES THAT IS VERY LIKELY I SAID
YES THAT IS VERY LIKELY HE REPLIED ALTHOUGH IN THIS RESPECT ARGUMENTS
ARE UNLIKE MEN THERE I WAS LED ON BY YOU TO SAY MORE THAN I HAD
INTENDED BUT THE POINT OF COMPARISON WAS THAT WHEN A SIMPLE MAN WHO
HAS NO SKILL IN DIALECTICS BELIEVES AN ARGUMENT TO BE TRUE WHICH HE
AFTERWARDS IMAGINES TO BE FALSE WHETHER REALLY FALSE OR NOT AND
THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER HE HAS NO LONGER ANY FAITH LEFT AND GREAT
DISPUTERS AS YOU KNOW COME TO THINK AT LAST THAT THEY HAVE GROWN TO BE
THE WISEST OF MANKIND FOR THEY ALONE PERCEIVE THE UTTER UNSOUNDNESS AND
INSTABILITY OF ALL ARGUMENTS OR INDEED OF ALL THINGS WHICH LIKE THE
CURRENTS IN THE EURIPUS ARE GOING UP AND DOWN IN NEVER CEASING EBB AND
FLOW
THAT IS QUITE TRUE I SAID
YES PHAEDO HE REPLIED AND HOW MELANCHOLY IF THERE BE SUCH A THING AS
TRUTH OR CERTAINTY OR POSSIBILITY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT A MAN SHOULD HAVE
LIGHTED UPON SOME ARGUMENT OR OTHER WHICH AT FIRST SEEMED TRUE AND THEN
TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE AND INSTEAD OF BLAMING HIMSELF AND HIS OWN WANT
OF WIT BECAUSE HE IS ANNOYED SHOULD AT LAST BE TOO GLAD TO TRANSFER
THE BLAME FROM HIMSELF TO ARGUMENTS IN GENERAL AND FOR EVER AFTERWARDS
SHOULD HATE AND REVILE THEM AND LOSE TRUTH AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF
REALITIES
YES INDEED I SAID THAT IS VERY MELANCHOLY
LET US THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE HE SAID BE CAREFUL OF ALLOWING OR OF
ADMITTING INTO OUR SOULS THE NOTION THAT THERE IS NO HEALTH OR SOUNDNESS
IN ANY ARGUMENTS AT ALL
RATHER SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT YET ATTAINED TO
SOUNDNESS IN OURSELVES AND THAT WE MUST STRUGGLE MANFULLY AND DO OUR
BEST TO GAIN HEALTH OF MIND YOU AND ALL OTHER MEN HAVING REGARD TO THE
WHOLE OF YOUR FUTURE LIFE AND I MYSELF IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH
FOR AT
THIS MOMENT I AM SENSIBLE THAT I HAVE NOT THE TEMPER OF A PHILOSOPHER
LIKE THE VULGAR I AM ONLY A PARTISAN
NOW THE PARTISAN WHEN HE IS
ENGAGED IN A DISPUTE CARES NOTHING ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE QUESTION
BUT IS ANXIOUS ONLY TO CONVINCE HIS HEARERS OF HIS OWN ASSERTIONS
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND ME AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS MERELY
THIS THAT WHEREAS HE SEEKS TO CONVINCE HIS HEARERS THAT WHAT HE SAYS IS
TRUE I AM RATHER SEEKING TO CONVINCE MYSELF TO CONVINCE MY HEARERS
IS A SECONDARY MATTER WITH ME
AND DO BUT SEE HOW MUCH I GAIN BY THE
ARGUMENT
FOR IF WHAT I SAY IS TRUE THEN I DO WELL TO BE PERSUADED OF
THE TRUTH BUT IF THERE BE NOTHING AFTER DEATH STILL DURING THE SHORT
TIME THAT REMAINS I SHALL NOT DISTRESS MY FRIENDS WITH LAMENTATIONS
AND MY IGNORANCE WILL NOT LAST BUT WILL DIE WITH ME AND THEREFORE
NO HARM WILL BE DONE
THIS IS THE STATE OF MIND SIMMIAS AND CEBES IN
WHICH I APPROACH THE ARGUMENT
AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO BE THINKING OF
THE TRUTH AND NOT OF SOCRATES AGREE WITH ME IF I SEEM TO YOU TO BE
SPEAKING THE TRUTH OR IF NOT WITHSTAND ME MIGHT AND MAIN THAT I MAY
NOT DECEIVE YOU AS WELL AS MYSELF IN MY ENTHUSIASM AND LIKE THE BEE
LEAVE MY STING IN YOU BEFORE I DIE
AND NOW LET US PROCEED HE SAID
AND FIRST OF ALL LET ME BE SURE THAT
I HAVE IN MY MIND WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
SIMMIAS IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
HAS FEARS AND MISGIVINGS WHETHER THE SOUL ALTHOUGH A FAIRER AND DIVINER
THING THAN THE BODY BEING AS SHE IS IN THE FORM OF HARMONY MAY NOT
PERISH FIRST
ON THE OTHER HAND CEBES APPEARED TO GRANT THAT THE SOUL
WAS MORE LASTING THAN THE BODY BUT HE SAID THAT NO ONE COULD KNOW
WHETHER THE SOUL AFTER HAVING WORN OUT MANY BODIES MIGHT NOT PERISH
HERSELF AND LEAVE HER LAST BODY BEHIND HER AND THAT THIS IS DEATH
WHICH IS THE DESTRUCTION NOT OF THE BODY BUT OF THE SOUL FOR IN THE
BODY THE WORK OF DESTRUCTION IS EVER GOING ON
ARE NOT THESE SIMMIAS
AND CEBES THE POINTS WHICH WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
THEY BOTH AGREED TO THIS STATEMENT OF THEM
HE PROCEEDED AND DID YOU DENY THE FORCE OF THE WHOLE PRECEDING
ARGUMENT OR OF A PART ONLY
OF A PART ONLY THEY REPLIED
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK HE SAID OF THAT PART OF THE ARGUMENT IN WHICH
WE SAID THAT KNOWLEDGE WAS RECOLLECTION AND HENCE INFERRED THAT THE
SOUL MUST HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXISTED SOMEWHERE ELSE BEFORE SHE WAS ENCLOSED
IN THE BODY
CEBES SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN WONDERFULLY IMPRESSED BY THAT PART OF THE
ARGUMENT AND THAT HIS CONVICTION REMAINED ABSOLUTELY UNSHAKEN
SIMMIAS
AGREED AND ADDED THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITY
OF HIS EVER THINKING DIFFERENTLY
BUT REJOINED SOCRATES YOU WILL HAVE TO THINK DIFFERENTLY MY THEBAN
FRIEND IF YOU STILL MAINTAIN THAT HARMONY IS A COMPOUND AND THAT THE
SOUL IS A HARMONY WHICH IS MADE OUT OF STRINGS SET IN THE FRAME OF THE
BODY FOR YOU WILL SURELY NEVER ALLOW YOURSELF TO SAY THAT A HARMONY IS
PRIOR TO THE ELEMENTS WHICH COMPOSE IT
NEVER SOCRATES
BUT DO YOU NOT SEE THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU IMPLY WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE
SOUL EXISTED BEFORE SHE TOOK THE FORM AND BODY OF MAN AND WAS MADE UP
OF ELEMENTS WHICH AS YET HAD NO EXISTENCE FOR HARMONY IS NOT LIKE
THE SOUL AS YOU SUPPOSE BUT FIRST THE LYRE AND THE STRINGS AND THE
SOUNDS EXIST IN A STATE OF DISCORD AND THEN HARMONY IS MADE LAST OF
ALL AND PERISHES FIRST
AND HOW CAN SUCH A NOTION OF THE SOUL AS THIS
AGREE WITH THE OTHER
NOT AT ALL REPLIED SIMMIAS
AND YET HE SAID THERE SURELY OUGHT TO BE HARMONY IN A DISCOURSE OF
WHICH HARMONY IS THE THEME
THERE OUGHT REPLIED SIMMIAS
BUT THERE IS NO HARMONY HE SAID IN THE TWO PROPOSITIONS THAT KNOWLEDGE
IS RECOLLECTION AND THAT THE SOUL IS A HARMONY
WHICH OF THEM WILL YOU
RETAIN
I THINK HE REPLIED THAT I HAVE A MUCH STRONGER FAITH SOCRATES IN THE
FIRST OF THE TWO WHICH HAS BEEN FULLY DEMONSTRATED TO ME THAN IN
THE LATTER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT ALL BUT RESTS ONLY ON
PROBABLE AND PLAUSIBLE GROUNDS AND IS THEREFORE BELIEVED BY THE MANY
I
KNOW TOO WELL THAT THESE ARGUMENTS FROM PROBABILITIES ARE IMPOSTORS AND
UNLESS GREAT CAUTION IS OBSERVED IN THE USE OF THEM THEY ARE APT TO
BE DECEPTIVE IN GEOMETRY AND IN OTHER THINGS TOO
BUT THE DOCTRINE OF
KNOWLEDGE AND RECOLLECTION HAS BEEN PROVEN TO ME ON TRUSTWORTHY GROUNDS
AND THE PROOF WAS THAT THE SOUL MUST HAVE EXISTED BEFORE SHE CAME INTO
THE BODY BECAUSE TO HER BELONGS THE ESSENCE OF WHICH THE VERY NAME
IMPLIES EXISTENCE
HAVING AS I AM CONVINCED RIGHTLY ACCEPTED THIS
CONCLUSION AND ON SUFFICIENT GROUNDS I MUST AS I SUPPOSE CEASE TO
ARGUE OR ALLOW OTHERS TO ARGUE THAT THE SOUL IS A HARMONY
LET ME PUT THE MATTER SIMMIAS HE SAID IN ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW DO
YOU IMAGINE THAT A HARMONY OR ANY OTHER COMPOSITION CAN BE IN A STATE
OTHER THAN THAT OF THE ELEMENTS OUT OF WHICH IT IS COMPOUNDED
CERTAINLY NOT
OR DO OR SUFFER ANYTHING OTHER THAN THEY DO OR SUFFER
HE AGREED
THEN A HARMONY DOES NOT PROPERLY SPEAKING LEAD THE PARTS OR ELEMENTS
WHICH MAKE UP THE HARMONY BUT ONLY FOLLOWS THEM
HE ASSENTED
FOR HARMONY CANNOT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY MOTION OR SOUND OR OTHER QUALITY
WHICH IS OPPOSED TO ITS PARTS
THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE HE REPLIED
AND DOES NOT THE NATURE OF EVERY HARMONY DEPEND UPON THE MANNER IN WHICH
THE ELEMENTS ARE HARMONIZED
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU HE SAID
I MEAN TO SAY THAT A HARMONY ADMITS OF DEGREES AND IS MORE OF A
HARMONY AND MORE COMPLETELY A HARMONY WHEN MORE TRULY AND FULLY
HARMONIZED TO ANY EXTENT WHICH IS POSSIBLE AND LESS OF A HARMONY AND
LESS COMPLETELY A HARMONY WHEN LESS TRULY AND FULLY HARMONIZED
TRUE
BUT DOES THE SOUL ADMIT OF DEGREES OR IS ONE SOUL IN THE VERY LEAST
DEGREE MORE OR LESS OR MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY A SOUL THAN ANOTHER
NOT IN THE LEAST
YET SURELY OF TWO SOULS ONE IS SAID TO HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND VIRTUE
AND TO BE GOOD AND THE OTHER TO HAVE FOLLY AND VICE AND TO BE AN EVIL
SOUL AND THIS IS SAID TRULY
YES TRULY
BUT WHAT WILL THOSE WHO MAINTAIN THE SOUL TO BE A HARMONY SAY OF THIS
PRESENCE OF VIRTUE AND VICE IN THE SOUL WILL THEY SAY THAT HERE IS
ANOTHER HARMONY AND ANOTHER DISCORD AND THAT THE VIRTUOUS SOUL IS
HARMONIZED AND HERSELF BEING A HARMONY HAS ANOTHER HARMONY WITHIN HER
AND THAT THE VICIOUS SOUL IS INHARMONICAL AND HAS NO HARMONY WITHIN HER
I CANNOT TELL REPLIED SIMMIAS BUT I SUPPOSE THAT SOMETHING OF THE SORT
WOULD BE ASSERTED BY THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE SOUL IS A HARMONY
AND WE HAVE ALREADY ADMITTED THAT NO SOUL IS MORE A SOUL THAN ANOTHER
WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ADMITTING THAT HARMONY IS NOT MORE OR LESS
HARMONY OR MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY A HARMONY
QUITE TRUE
AND THAT WHICH IS NOT MORE OR LESS A HARMONY IS NOT MORE OR LESS
HARMONIZED
TRUE
AND THAT WHICH IS NOT MORE OR LESS HARMONIZED CANNOT HAVE MORE OR LESS
OF HARMONY BUT ONLY AN EQUAL HARMONY
YES AN EQUAL HARMONY
THEN ONE SOUL NOT BEING MORE OR LESS ABSOLUTELY A SOUL THAN ANOTHER IS
NOT MORE OR LESS HARMONIZED
EXACTLY
AND THEREFORE HAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS OF DISCORD NOR YET OF HARMONY
SHE HAS NOT
AND HAVING NEITHER MORE NOR LESS OF HARMONY OR OF DISCORD ONE SOUL
HAS NO MORE VICE OR VIRTUE THAN ANOTHER IF VICE BE DISCORD AND VIRTUE
HARMONY
NOT AT ALL MORE
OR SPEAKING MORE CORRECTLY SIMMIAS THE SOUL IF SHE IS A HARMONY WILL
NEVER HAVE ANY VICE BECAUSE A HARMONY BEING ABSOLUTELY A HARMONY HAS
NO PART IN THE INHARMONICAL
NO
AND THEREFORE A SOUL WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY A SOUL HAS NO VICE
HOW CAN SHE HAVE IF THE PREVIOUS ARGUMENT HOLDS
THEN IF ALL SOULS ARE EQUALLY BY THEIR NATURE SOULS ALL SOULS OF ALL
LIVING CREATURES WILL BE EQUALLY GOOD
I AGREE WITH YOU SOCRATES HE SAID
AND CAN ALL THIS BE TRUE THINK YOU HE SAID FOR THESE ARE THE
CONSEQUENCES WHICH SEEM TO FOLLOW FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SOUL IS A
HARMONY
IT CANNOT BE TRUE
ONCE MORE HE SAID WHAT RULER IS THERE OF THE ELEMENTS OF HUMAN NATURE
OTHER THAN THE SOUL AND ESPECIALLY THE WISE SOUL DO YOU KNOW OF ANY
INDEED I DO NOT
AND IS THE SOUL IN AGREEMENT WITH THE AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY OR IS SHE
AT VARIANCE WITH THEM FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE BODY IS HOT AND THIRSTY
DOES NOT THE SOUL INCLINE US AGAINST DRINKING AND WHEN THE BODY
IS HUNGRY AGAINST EATING AND THIS IS ONLY ONE INSTANCE OUT OF TEN
THOUSAND OF THE OPPOSITION OF THE SOUL TO THE THINGS OF THE BODY
VERY TRUE
BUT WE HAVE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SOUL BEING A HARMONY CAN
NEVER UTTER A NOTE AT VARIANCE WITH THE TENSIONS AND RELAXATIONS AND
VIBRATIONS AND OTHER AFFECTIONS OF THE STRINGS OUT OF WHICH SHE IS
COMPOSED SHE CAN ONLY FOLLOW SHE CANNOT LEAD THEM
IT MUST BE SO HE REPLIED
AND YET DO WE NOT NOW DISCOVER THE SOUL TO BE DOING THE EXACT
OPPOSITE LEADING THE ELEMENTS OF WHICH SHE IS BELIEVED TO BE COMPOSED
ALMOST ALWAYS OPPOSING AND COERCING THEM IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS THROUGHOUT
LIFE SOMETIMES MORE VIOLENTLY WITH THE PAINS OF MEDICINE AND GYMNASTIC
THEN AGAIN MORE GENTLY NOW THREATENING NOW ADMONISHING THE DESIRES
PASSIONS FEARS AS IF TALKING TO A THING WHICH IS NOT HERSELF AS HOMER
IN THE ODYSSEE REPRESENTS ODYSSEUS DOING IN THE WORDS
'HE BEAT HIS BREAST AND THUS REPROACHED HIS HEART ENDURE MY HEART
FAR WORSE HAST THOU ENDURED
DO YOU THINK THAT HOMER WROTE THIS UNDER THE IDEA THAT THE SOUL IS A
HARMONY CAPABLE OF BEING LED BY THE AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY AND NOT
RATHER OF A NATURE WHICH SHOULD LEAD AND MASTER THEM HERSELF A FAR
DIVINER THING THAN ANY HARMONY
YES SOCRATES I QUITE THINK SO
THEN MY FRIEND WE CAN NEVER BE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT THE SOUL IS A
HARMONY FOR WE SHOULD CONTRADICT THE DIVINE HOMER AND CONTRADICT
OURSELVES
TRUE HE SAID
THUS MUCH SAID SOCRATES OF HARMONIA YOUR THEBAN GODDESS WHO HAS
GRACIOUSLY YIELDED TO US BUT WHAT SHALL I SAY CEBES TO HER HUSBAND
CADMUS AND HOW SHALL I MAKE PEACE WITH HIM
I THINK THAT YOU WILL DISCOVER A WAY OF PROPITIATING HIM SAID CEBES I
AM SURE THAT YOU HAVE PUT THE ARGUMENT WITH HARMONIA IN A MANNER THAT
I COULD NEVER HAVE EXPECTED
FOR WHEN SIMMIAS WAS MENTIONING HIS
DIFFICULTY I QUITE IMAGINED THAT NO ANSWER COULD BE GIVEN TO HIM AND
THEREFORE I WAS SURPRISED AT FINDING THAT HIS ARGUMENT COULD NOT SUSTAIN
THE FIRST ONSET OF YOURS AND NOT IMPOSSIBLY THE OTHER WHOM YOU CALL
CADMUS MAY SHARE A SIMILAR FATE
NAY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID SOCRATES LET US NOT BOAST LEST SOME EVIL EYE
SHOULD PUT TO FLIGHT THE WORD WHICH I AM ABOUT TO SPEAK
THAT HOWEVER
MAY BE LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THOSE ABOVE WHILE I DRAW NEAR IN HOMERIC
FASHION AND TRY THE METTLE OF YOUR WORDS
HERE LIES THE POINT YOU
WANT TO HAVE IT PROVEN TO YOU THAT THE SOUL IS IMPERISHABLE AND
IMMORTAL AND THE PHILOSOPHER WHO IS CONFIDENT IN DEATH APPEARS TO YOU
TO HAVE BUT A VAIN AND FOOLISH CONFIDENCE IF HE BELIEVES THAT HE WILL
FARE BETTER IN THE WORLD BELOW THAN ONE WHO HAS LED ANOTHER SORT OF
LIFE UNLESS HE CAN PROVE THIS AND YOU SAY THAT THE DEMONSTRATION OF
THE STRENGTH AND DIVINITY OF THE SOUL AND OF HER EXISTENCE PRIOR TO OUR
BECOMING MEN DOES NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY HER IMMORTALITY
ADMITTING THE
SOUL TO BE LONGLIVED AND TO HAVE KNOWN AND DONE MUCH IN A FORMER STATE
STILL SHE IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT IMMORTAL AND HER ENTRANCE INTO
THE HUMAN FORM MAY BE A SORT OF DISEASE WHICH IS THE BEGINNING OF
DISSOLUTION AND MAY AT LAST AFTER THE TOILS OF LIFE ARE OVER END IN
THAT WHICH IS CALLED DEATH
AND WHETHER THE SOUL ENTERS INTO THE BODY
ONCE ONLY OR MANY TIMES DOES NOT AS YOU SAY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN
THE FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS
FOR ANY MAN WHO IS NOT DEVOID OF SENSE
MUST FEAR IF HE HAS NO KNOWLEDGE AND CAN GIVE NO ACCOUNT OF THE SOUL'S
IMMORTALITY
THIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS I SUSPECT TO BE YOUR NOTION
CEBES AND I DESIGNEDLY RECUR TO IT IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MAY ESCAPE US
AND THAT YOU MAY IF YOU WISH ADD OR SUBTRACT ANYTHING
BUT SAID CEBES AS FAR AS I SEE AT PRESENT I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD OR
SUBTRACT I MEAN WHAT YOU SAY THAT I MEAN
SOCRATES PAUSED AWHILE AND SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN REFLECTION
AT
LENGTH HE SAID YOU ARE RAISING A TREMENDOUS QUESTION CEBES INVOLVING
THE WHOLE NATURE OF GENERATION AND CORRUPTION ABOUT WHICH IF YOU LIKE
I WILL GIVE YOU MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND IF ANYTHING WHICH I SAY IS LIKELY
TO AVAIL TOWARDS THE SOLUTION OF YOUR DIFFICULTY YOU MAY MAKE USE OF IT
I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE SAID CEBES TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
THEN I WILL TELL YOU SAID SOCRATES
WHEN I WAS YOUNG CEBES I HAD A
PRODIGIOUS DESIRE TO KNOW THAT DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS CALLED
THE INVESTIGATION OF NATURE TO KNOW THE CAUSES OF THINGS AND WHY
A THING IS AND IS CREATED OR DESTROYED APPEARED TO ME TO BE A LOFTY
PROFESSION AND I WAS ALWAYS AGITATING MYSELF WITH THE CONSIDERATION OF
QUESTIONS SUCH AS THESE IS THE GROWTH OF ANIMALS THE RESULT OF SOME
DECAY WHICH THE HOT AND COLD PRINCIPLE CONTRACTS AS SOME HAVE SAID IS
THE BLOOD THE ELEMENT WITH WHICH WE THINK OR THE AIR OR THE FIRE OR
PERHAPS NOTHING OF THE KIND BUT THE BRAIN MAY BE THE ORIGINATING
POWER OF THE PERCEPTIONS OF HEARING AND SIGHT AND SMELL AND MEMORY
AND OPINION MAY COME FROM THEM AND SCIENCE MAY BE BASED ON MEMORY AND
OPINION WHEN THEY HAVE ATTAINED FIXITY
AND THEN I WENT ON TO EXAMINE
THE CORRUPTION OF THEM AND THEN TO THE THINGS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH AND
AT LAST I CONCLUDED MYSELF TO BE UTTERLY AND ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE
OF THESE ENQUIRIES AS I WILL SATISFACTORILY PROVE TO YOU
FOR I WAS
FASCINATED BY THEM TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT MY EYES GREW BLIND TO THINGS
WHICH I HAD SEEMED TO MYSELF AND ALSO TO OTHERS TO KNOW QUITE WELL I
FORGOT WHAT I HAD BEFORE THOUGHT SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS E G
SUCH A FACT
AS THAT THE GROWTH OF MAN IS THE RESULT OF EATING AND DRINKING FOR WHEN
BY THE DIGESTION OF FOOD FLESH IS ADDED TO FLESH AND BONE TO BONE AND
WHENEVER THERE IS AN AGGREGATION OF CONGENIAL ELEMENTS THE LESSER
BULK BECOMES LARGER AND THE SMALL MAN GREAT
WAS NOT THAT A REASONABLE
NOTION
YES SAID CEBES I THINK SO
WELL BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING MORE
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I
THOUGHT THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF GREATER AND LESS PRETTY WELL
AND WHEN I SAW A GREAT MAN STANDING BY A LITTLE ONE I FANCIED THAT ONE
WAS TALLER THAN THE OTHER BY A HEAD OR ONE HORSE WOULD APPEAR TO
BE GREATER THAN ANOTHER HORSE AND STILL MORE CLEARLY DID I SEEM TO
PERCEIVE THAT TEN IS TWO MORE THAN EIGHT AND THAT TWO CUBITS ARE MORE
THAN ONE BECAUSE TWO IS THE DOUBLE OF ONE
AND WHAT IS NOW YOUR NOTION OF SUCH MATTERS SAID CEBES
I SHOULD BE FAR ENOUGH FROM IMAGINING HE REPLIED THAT I KNEW THE CAUSE
OF ANY OF THEM BY HEAVEN I SHOULD FOR I CANNOT SATISFY MYSELF THAT
WHEN ONE IS ADDED TO ONE THE ONE TO WHICH THE ADDITION IS MADE BECOMES
TWO OR THAT THE TWO UNITS ADDED TOGETHER MAKE TWO BY REASON OF THE
ADDITION
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE OTHER EACH
OF THEM WAS ONE AND NOT TWO AND NOW WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER
THE MERE JUXTAPOSITION OR MEETING OF THEM SHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR
BECOMING TWO NEITHER CAN I UNDERSTAND HOW THE DIVISION OF ONE IS THE
WAY TO MAKE TWO FOR THEN A DIFFERENT CAUSE WOULD PRODUCE THE SAME
EFFECT AS IN THE FORMER INSTANCE THE ADDITION AND JUXTAPOSITION OF ONE
TO ONE WAS THE CAUSE OF TWO IN THIS THE SEPARATION AND SUBTRACTION OF
ONE FROM THE OTHER WOULD BE THE CAUSE
NOR AM I ANY LONGER SATISFIED
THAT I UNDERSTAND THE REASON WHY ONE OR ANYTHING ELSE IS EITHER
GENERATED OR DESTROYED OR IS AT ALL BUT I HAVE IN MY MIND SOME CONFUSED
NOTION OF A NEW METHOD AND CAN NEVER ADMIT THE OTHER
THEN I HEARD SOME ONE READING AS HE SAID FROM A BOOK OF ANAXAGORAS
THAT MIND WAS THE DISPOSER AND CAUSE OF ALL AND I WAS DELIGHTED AT THIS
NOTION WHICH APPEARED QUITE ADMIRABLE AND I SAID TO MYSELF IF MIND
IS THE DISPOSER MIND WILL DISPOSE ALL FOR THE BEST AND PUT EACH
PARTICULAR IN THE BEST PLACE AND I ARGUED THAT IF ANY ONE DESIRED TO
FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF THE GENERATION OR DESTRUCTION OR EXISTENCE OF
ANYTHING HE MUST FIND OUT WHAT STATE OF BEING OR DOING OR SUFFERING WAS
BEST FOR THAT THING AND THEREFORE A MAN HAD ONLY TO CONSIDER THE BEST
FOR HIMSELF AND OTHERS AND THEN HE WOULD ALSO KNOW THE WORSE SINCE THE
SAME SCIENCE COMPREHENDED BOTH
AND I REJOICED TO THINK THAT I HAD FOUND
IN ANAXAGORAS A TEACHER OF THE CAUSES OF EXISTENCE SUCH AS I DESIRED
AND I IMAGINED THAT HE WOULD TELL ME FIRST WHETHER THE EARTH IS FLAT OR
ROUND AND WHICHEVER WAS TRUE HE WOULD PROCEED TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE AND
THE NECESSITY OF THIS BEING SO AND THEN HE WOULD TEACH ME THE NATURE OF
THE BEST AND SHOW THAT THIS WAS BEST AND IF HE SAID THAT THE EARTH WAS
IN THE CENTRE HE WOULD FURTHER EXPLAIN THAT THIS POSITION WAS THE BEST
AND I SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH THE EXPLANATION GIVEN AND NOT WANT ANY
OTHER SORT OF CAUSE
AND I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD THEN GO ON AND ASK HIM
ABOUT THE SUN AND MOON AND STARS AND THAT HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO ME THEIR
COMPARATIVE SWIFTNESS AND THEIR RETURNINGS AND VARIOUS STATES ACTIVE
AND PASSIVE AND HOW ALL OF THEM WERE FOR THE BEST
FOR I COULD NOT
IMAGINE THAT WHEN HE SPOKE OF MIND AS THE DISPOSER OF THEM HE WOULD
GIVE ANY OTHER ACCOUNT OF THEIR BEING AS THEY ARE EXCEPT THAT THIS WAS
BEST AND I THOUGHT THAT WHEN HE HAD EXPLAINED TO ME IN DETAIL THE CAUSE
OF EACH AND THE CAUSE OF ALL HE WOULD GO ON TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT WAS
BEST FOR EACH AND WHAT WAS GOOD FOR ALL
THESE HOPES I WOULD NOT HAVE
SOLD FOR A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND I SEIZED THE BOOKS AND READ THEM AS
FAST AS I COULD IN MY EAGERNESS TO KNOW THE BETTER AND THE WORSE
WHAT EXPECTATIONS I HAD FORMED AND HOW GRIEVOUSLY WAS I DISAPPOINTED
AS I PROCEEDED I FOUND MY PHILOSOPHER ALTOGETHER FORSAKING MIND OR ANY
OTHER PRINCIPLE OF ORDER BUT HAVING RECOURSE TO AIR AND ETHER AND
WATER AND OTHER ECCENTRICITIES
I MIGHT COMPARE HIM TO A PERSON WHO
BEGAN BY MAINTAINING GENERALLY THAT MIND IS THE CAUSE OF THE ACTIONS
OF SOCRATES BUT WHO WHEN HE ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSES OF MY
SEVERAL ACTIONS IN DETAIL WENT ON TO SHOW THAT I SIT HERE BECAUSE MY
BODY IS MADE UP OF BONES AND MUSCLES AND THE BONES AS HE WOULD SAY
ARE HARD AND HAVE JOINTS WHICH DIVIDE THEM AND THE MUSCLES ARE ELASTIC
AND THEY COVER THE BONES WHICH HAVE ALSO A COVERING OR ENVIRONMENT OF
FLESH AND SKIN WHICH CONTAINS THEM AND AS THE BONES ARE LIFTED AT THEIR
JOINTS BY THE CONTRACTION OR RELAXATION OF THE MUSCLES I AM ABLE
TO BEND MY LIMBS AND THIS IS WHY I AM SITTING HERE IN A CURVED
POSTURE THAT IS WHAT HE WOULD SAY AND HE WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR
EXPLANATION OF MY TALKING TO YOU WHICH HE WOULD ATTRIBUTE TO SOUND AND
AIR AND HEARING AND HE WOULD ASSIGN TEN THOUSAND OTHER CAUSES OF THE
SAME SORT FORGETTING TO MENTION THE TRUE CAUSE WHICH IS THAT THE
ATHENIANS HAVE THOUGHT FIT TO CONDEMN ME AND ACCORDINGLY I HAVE THOUGHT
IT BETTER AND MORE RIGHT TO REMAIN HERE AND UNDERGO MY SENTENCE FOR
I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THESE MUSCLES AND BONES OF MINE WOULD HAVE
GONE OFF LONG AGO TO MEGARA OR BOEOTIA BY THE DOG THEY WOULD IF THEY
HAD BEEN MOVED ONLY BY THEIR OWN IDEA OF WHAT WAS BEST AND IF I HAD NOT
CHOSEN THE BETTER AND NOBLER PART INSTEAD OF PLAYING TRUANT AND RUNNING
AWAY OF ENDURING ANY PUNISHMENT WHICH THE STATE INFLICTS
THERE IS
SURELY A STRANGE CONFUSION OF CAUSES AND CONDITIONS IN ALL THIS
IT MAY
BE SAID INDEED THAT WITHOUT BONES AND MUSCLES AND THE OTHER PARTS
OF THE BODY I CANNOT EXECUTE MY PURPOSES
BUT TO SAY THAT I DO AS I DO
BECAUSE OF THEM AND THAT THIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH MIND ACTS AND
NOT FROM THE CHOICE OF THE BEST IS A VERY CARELESS AND IDLE MODE OF
SPEAKING
I WONDER THAT THEY CANNOT DISTINGUISH THE CAUSE FROM THE
CONDITION WHICH THE MANY FEELING ABOUT IN THE DARK ARE ALWAYS
MISTAKING AND MISNAMING
AND THUS ONE MAN MAKES A VORTEX ALL ROUND AND
STEADIES THE EARTH BY THE HEAVEN ANOTHER GIVES THE AIR AS A SUPPORT TO
THE EARTH WHICH IS A SORT OF BROAD TROUGH
ANY POWER WHICH IN ARRANGING
THEM AS THEY ARE ARRANGES THEM FOR THE BEST NEVER ENTERS INTO THEIR
MINDS AND INSTEAD OF FINDING ANY SUPERIOR STRENGTH IN IT THEY RATHER
EXPECT TO DISCOVER ANOTHER ATLAS OF THE WORLD WHO IS STRONGER AND MORE
EVERLASTING AND MORE CONTAINING THAN THE GOOD OF THE OBLIGATORY AND
CONTAINING POWER OF THE GOOD THEY THINK NOTHING AND YET THIS IS THE
PRINCIPLE WHICH I WOULD FAIN LEARN IF ANY ONE WOULD TEACH ME
BUT AS I
HAVE FAILED EITHER TO DISCOVER MYSELF OR TO LEARN OF ANY ONE ELSE
THE NATURE OF THE BEST I WILL EXHIBIT TO YOU IF YOU LIKE WHAT I HAVE
FOUND TO BE THE SECOND BEST MODE OF ENQUIRING INTO THE CAUSE
I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR HE REPLIED
SOCRATES PROCEEDED I THOUGHT THAT AS I HAD FAILED IN THE CONTEMPLATION
OF TRUE EXISTENCE I OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL THAT I DID NOT LOSE THE EYE OF
MY SOUL AS PEOPLE MAY INJURE THEIR BODILY EYE BY OBSERVING AND GAZING
ON THE SUN DURING AN ECLIPSE UNLESS THEY TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF ONLY
LOOKING AT THE IMAGE REFLECTED IN THE WATER OR IN SOME SIMILAR MEDIUM
SO IN MY OWN CASE I WAS AFRAID THAT MY SOUL MIGHT BE BLINDED ALTOGETHER
IF I LOOKED AT THINGS WITH MY EYES OR TRIED TO APPREHEND THEM BY THE
HELP OF THE SENSES
AND I THOUGHT THAT I HAD BETTER HAVE RECOURSE TO THE
WORLD OF MIND AND SEEK THERE THE TRUTH OF EXISTENCE
I DARE SAY THAT
THE SIMILE IS NOT PERFECT FOR I AM VERY FAR FROM ADMITTING THAT HE WHO
CONTEMPLATES EXISTENCES THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THOUGHT SEES THEM ONLY
'THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY ANY MORE THAN HE WHO CONSIDERS THEM IN ACTION
AND OPERATION
HOWEVER THIS WAS THE METHOD WHICH I ADOPTED I FIRST
ASSUMED SOME PRINCIPLE WHICH I JUDGED TO BE THE STRONGEST AND THEN I
AFFIRMED AS TRUE WHATEVER SEEMED TO AGREE WITH THIS WHETHER RELATING
TO THE CAUSE OR TO ANYTHING ELSE AND THAT WHICH DISAGREED I REGARDED
AS UNTRUE
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN MY MEANING MORE CLEARLY AS I DO
NOT THINK THAT YOU AS YET UNDERSTAND ME
NO INDEED REPLIED CEBES NOT VERY WELL
THERE IS NOTHING NEW HE SAID IN WHAT I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU BUT
ONLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN ALWAYS AND EVERYWHERE REPEATING IN THE PREVIOUS
DISCUSSION AND ON OTHER OCCASIONS I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE NATURE OF THAT
CAUSE WHICH HAS OCCUPIED MY THOUGHTS
I SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THOSE
FAMILIAR WORDS WHICH ARE IN THE MOUTH OF EVERY ONE AND FIRST OF ALL
ASSUME THAT THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AND GOODNESS AND GREATNESS AND
THE LIKE GRANT ME THIS AND I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU THE NATURE OF
THE CAUSE AND TO PROVE THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL
CEBES SAID YOU MAY PROCEED AT ONCE WITH THE PROOF FOR I GRANT YOU
THIS
WELL HE SAID THEN I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME
IN THE NEXT STEP FOR I CANNOT HELP THINKING IF THERE BE ANYTHING
BEAUTIFUL OTHER THAN ABSOLUTE BEAUTY SHOULD THERE BE SUCH THAT IT CAN
BE BEAUTIFUL ONLY IN AS FAR AS IT PARTAKES OF ABSOLUTE BEAUTY AND I
SHOULD SAY THE SAME OF EVERYTHING
DO YOU AGREE IN THIS NOTION OF THE
CAUSE
YES HE SAID I AGREE
HE PROCEEDED I KNOW NOTHING AND CAN UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF ANY OTHER OF
THOSE WISE CAUSES WHICH ARE ALLEGED AND IF A PERSON SAYS TO ME THAT
THE BLOOM OF COLOUR OR FORM OR ANY SUCH THING IS A SOURCE OF BEAUTY
I LEAVE ALL THAT WHICH IS ONLY CONFUSING TO ME AND SIMPLY AND SINGLY
AND PERHAPS FOOLISHLY HOLD AND AM ASSURED IN MY OWN MIND THAT NOTHING
MAKES A THING BEAUTIFUL BUT THE PRESENCE AND PARTICIPATION OF BEAUTY IN
WHATEVER WAY OR MANNER OBTAINED FOR AS TO THE MANNER I AM UNCERTAIN
BUT I STOUTLY CONTEND THAT BY BEAUTY ALL BEAUTIFUL THINGS BECOME
BEAUTIFUL
THIS APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE SAFEST ANSWER WHICH I CAN GIVE
EITHER TO MYSELF OR TO ANOTHER AND TO THIS I CLING IN THE PERSUASION
THAT THIS PRINCIPLE WILL NEVER BE OVERTHROWN AND THAT TO MYSELF OR
TO ANY ONE WHO ASKS THE QUESTION I MAY SAFELY REPLY THAT BY BEAUTY
BEAUTIFUL THINGS BECOME BEAUTIFUL
DO YOU NOT AGREE WITH ME
I DO
AND THAT BY GREATNESS ONLY GREAT THINGS BECOME GREAT AND GREATER
GREATER AND BY SMALLNESS THE LESS BECOME LESS
TRUE
THEN IF A PERSON WERE TO REMARK THAT A IS TALLER BY A HEAD THAN B AND
B LESS BY A HEAD THAN A YOU WOULD REFUSE TO ADMIT HIS STATEMENT AND
WOULD STOUTLY CONTEND THAT WHAT YOU MEAN IS ONLY THAT THE GREATER IS
GREATER BY AND BY REASON OF GREATNESS AND THE LESS IS LESS ONLY BY
AND BY REASON OF SMALLNESS AND THUS YOU WOULD AVOID THE DANGER OF
SAYING THAT THE GREATER IS GREATER AND THE LESS LESS BY THE MEASURE OF
THE HEAD WHICH IS THE SAME IN BOTH AND WOULD ALSO AVOID THE MONSTROUS
ABSURDITY OF SUPPOSING THAT THE GREATER MAN IS GREATER BY REASON OF THE
HEAD WHICH IS SMALL
YOU WOULD BE AFRAID TO DRAW SUCH AN INFERENCE
WOULD YOU NOT
INDEED I SHOULD SAID CEBES LAUGHING
IN LIKE MANNER YOU WOULD BE AFRAID TO SAY THAT TEN EXCEEDED EIGHT BY
AND BY REASON OF TWO BUT WOULD SAY BY AND BY REASON OF NUMBER OR
YOU WOULD SAY THAT TWO CUBITS EXCEED ONE CUBIT NOT BY A HALF BUT BY
MAGNITUDE FOR THERE IS THE SAME LIABILITY TO ERROR IN ALL THESE CASES
VERY TRUE HE SAID
AGAIN WOULD YOU NOT BE CAUTIOUS OF AFFIRMING THAT THE ADDITION OF
ONE TO ONE OR THE DIVISION OF ONE IS THE CAUSE OF TWO AND YOU WOULD
LOUDLY ASSEVERATE THAT YOU KNOW OF NO WAY IN WHICH ANYTHING COMES
INTO EXISTENCE EXCEPT BY PARTICIPATION IN ITS OWN PROPER ESSENCE
AND CONSEQUENTLY AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THE ONLY CAUSE OF TWO IS
THE PARTICIPATION IN DUALITY THIS IS THE WAY TO MAKE TWO AND THE
PARTICIPATION IN ONE IS THE WAY TO MAKE ONE
YOU WOULD SAY I WILL LET
ALONE PUZZLES OF DIVISION AND ADDITION WISER HEADS THAN MINE MAY ANSWER
THEM INEXPERIENCED AS I AM AND READY TO START AS THE PROVERB SAYS
AT MY OWN SHADOW I CANNOT AFFORD TO GIVE UP THE SURE GROUND OF A
PRINCIPLE
AND IF ANY ONE ASSAILS YOU THERE YOU WOULD NOT MIND HIM
OR ANSWER HIM UNTIL YOU HAD SEEN WHETHER THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH FOLLOW
AGREE WITH ONE ANOTHER OR NOT AND WHEN YOU ARE FURTHER REQUIRED TO GIVE
AN EXPLANATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE YOU WOULD GO ON TO ASSUME A HIGHER
PRINCIPLE AND A HIGHER UNTIL YOU FOUND A RESTING PLACE IN THE BEST OF
THE HIGHER BUT YOU WOULD NOT CONFUSE THE PRINCIPLE AND THE CONSEQUENCES
IN YOUR REASONING LIKE THE ERISTICS AT LEAST IF YOU WANTED TO DISCOVER
REAL EXISTENCE
NOT THAT THIS CONFUSION SIGNIFIES TO THEM WHO NEVER
CARE OR THINK ABOUT THE MATTER AT ALL FOR THEY HAVE THE WIT TO BE WELL
PLEASED WITH THEMSELVES HOWEVER GREAT MAY BE THE TURMOIL OF THEIR IDEAS
BUT YOU IF YOU ARE A PHILOSOPHER WILL CERTAINLY DO AS I SAY
WHAT YOU SAY IS MOST TRUE SAID SIMMIAS AND CEBES BOTH SPEAKING AT
ONCE
ECHECRATES YES PHAEDO AND I DO NOT WONDER AT THEIR ASSENTING
ANY
ONE WHO HAS THE LEAST SENSE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE WONDERFUL CLEARNESS OF
SOCRATES' REASONING
PHAEDO CERTAINLY ECHECRATES AND SUCH WAS THE FEELING OF THE WHOLE
COMPANY AT THE TIME
ECHECRATES YES AND EQUALLY OF OURSELVES WHO WERE NOT OF THE COMPANY
AND ARE NOW LISTENING TO YOUR RECITAL
BUT WHAT FOLLOWED
PHAEDO AFTER ALL THIS HAD BEEN ADMITTED AND THEY HAD THAT IDEAS EXIST
AND THAT OTHER THINGS PARTICIPATE IN THEM AND DERIVE THEIR NAMES FROM
THEM SOCRATES IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY SAID
THIS IS YOUR WAY OF SPEAKING AND YET WHEN YOU SAY THAT SIMMIAS IS
GREATER THAN SOCRATES AND LESS THAN PHAEDO DO YOU NOT PREDICATE OF
SIMMIAS BOTH GREATNESS AND SMALLNESS
YES I DO
BUT STILL YOU ALLOW THAT SIMMIAS DOES NOT REALLY EXCEED SOCRATES AS
THE WORDS MAY SEEM TO IMPLY BECAUSE HE IS SIMMIAS BUT BY REASON OF THE
SIZE WHICH HE HAS JUST AS SIMMIAS DOES NOT EXCEED SOCRATES BECAUSE HE
IS SIMMIAS ANY MORE THAN BECAUSE SOCRATES IS SOCRATES BUT BECAUSE HE
HAS SMALLNESS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE GREATNESS OF SIMMIAS
TRUE
AND IF PHAEDO EXCEEDS HIM IN SIZE THIS IS NOT BECAUSE PHAEDO IS
PHAEDO BUT BECAUSE PHAEDO HAS GREATNESS RELATIVELY TO SIMMIAS WHO IS
COMPARATIVELY SMALLER
THAT IS TRUE
AND THEREFORE SIMMIAS IS SAID TO BE GREAT AND IS ALSO SAID TO BE SMALL
BECAUSE HE IS IN A MEAN BETWEEN THEM EXCEEDING THE SMALLNESS OF THE ONE
BY HIS GREATNESS AND ALLOWING THE GREATNESS OF THE OTHER TO EXCEED HIS
SMALLNESS
HE ADDED LAUGHING I AM SPEAKING LIKE A BOOK BUT I BELIEVE
THAT WHAT I AM SAYING IS TRUE
SIMMIAS ASSENTED
I SPEAK AS I DO BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING NOT
ONLY THAT ABSOLUTE GREATNESS WILL NEVER BE GREAT AND ALSO SMALL BUT
THAT GREATNESS IN US OR IN THE CONCRETE WILL NEVER ADMIT THE SMALL OR
ADMIT OF BEING EXCEEDED INSTEAD OF THIS ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN
EITHER THE GREATER WILL FLY OR RETIRE BEFORE THE OPPOSITE WHICH IS THE
LESS OR AT THE APPROACH OF THE LESS HAS ALREADY CEASED TO EXIST BUT
WILL NOT IF ALLOWING OR ADMITTING OF SMALLNESS BE CHANGED BY THAT
EVEN AS I HAVING RECEIVED AND ADMITTED SMALLNESS WHEN COMPARED WITH
SIMMIAS REMAIN JUST AS I WAS AND AM THE SAME SMALL PERSON
AND AS THE
IDEA OF GREATNESS CANNOT CONDESCEND EVER TO BE OR BECOME SMALL IN LIKE
MANNER THE SMALLNESS IN US CANNOT BE OR BECOME GREAT NOR CAN ANY OTHER
OPPOSITE WHICH REMAINS THE SAME EVER BE OR BECOME ITS OWN OPPOSITE BUT
EITHER PASSES AWAY OR PERISHES IN THE CHANGE
THAT REPLIED CEBES IS QUITE MY NOTION
HEREUPON ONE OF THE COMPANY THOUGH I DO NOT EXACTLY REMEMBER WHICH OF
THEM SAID IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS NOT THIS THE DIRECT CONTRARY OF WHAT
WAS ADMITTED BEFORE THAT OUT OF THE GREATER CAME THE LESS AND OUT OF
THE LESS THE GREATER AND THAT OPPOSITES WERE SIMPLY GENERATED FROM
OPPOSITES BUT NOW THIS PRINCIPLE SEEMS TO BE UTTERLY DENIED
SOCRATES INCLINED HIS HEAD TO THE SPEAKER AND LISTENED
I LIKE YOUR
COURAGE HE SAID IN REMINDING US OF THIS
BUT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE THAT
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO CASES
FOR THEN WE WERE SPEAKING OF
OPPOSITES IN THE CONCRETE AND NOW OF THE ESSENTIAL OPPOSITE WHICH AS
IS AFFIRMED NEITHER IN US NOR IN NATURE CAN EVER BE AT VARIANCE WITH
ITSELF THEN MY FRIEND WE WERE SPEAKING OF THINGS IN WHICH OPPOSITES
ARE INHERENT AND WHICH ARE CALLED AFTER THEM BUT NOW ABOUT THE
OPPOSITES WHICH ARE INHERENT IN THEM AND WHICH GIVE THEIR NAME TO THEM
AND THESE ESSENTIAL OPPOSITES WILL NEVER AS WE MAINTAIN ADMIT OF
GENERATION INTO OR OUT OF ONE ANOTHER
AT THE SAME TIME TURNING TO
CEBES HE SAID ARE YOU AT ALL DISCONCERTED CEBES AT OUR FRIEND'S
OBJECTION
NO I DO NOT FEEL SO SAID CEBES AND YET I CANNOT DENY THAT I AM OFTEN
DISTURBED BY OBJECTIONS
THEN WE ARE AGREED AFTER ALL SAID SOCRATES THAT THE OPPOSITE WILL
NEVER IN ANY CASE BE OPPOSED TO ITSELF
TO THAT WE ARE QUITE AGREED HE REPLIED
YET ONCE MORE LET ME ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION FROM ANOTHER POINT
OF VIEW AND SEE WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME THERE IS A THING WHICH YOU
TERM HEAT AND ANOTHER THING WHICH YOU TERM COLD
CERTAINLY
BUT ARE THEY THE SAME AS FIRE AND SNOW
MOST ASSUREDLY NOT
HEAT IS A THING DIFFERENT FROM FIRE AND COLD IS NOT THE SAME WITH SNOW
YES
AND YET YOU WILL SURELY ADMIT THAT WHEN SNOW AS WAS BEFORE SAID IS
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT THEY WILL NOT REMAIN SNOW AND HEAT BUT AT
THE ADVANCE OF THE HEAT THE SNOW WILL EITHER RETIRE OR PERISH
VERY TRUE HE REPLIED
AND THE FIRE TOO AT THE ADVANCE OF THE COLD WILL EITHER RETIRE OR
PERISH AND WHEN THE FIRE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE COLD THEY WILL
NOT REMAIN AS BEFORE FIRE AND COLD
THAT IS TRUE HE SAID
AND IN SOME CASES THE NAME OF THE IDEA IS NOT ONLY ATTACHED TO THE IDEA
IN AN ETERNAL CONNECTION BUT ANYTHING ELSE WHICH NOT BEING THE IDEA
EXISTS ONLY IN THE FORM OF THE IDEA MAY ALSO LAY CLAIM TO IT
I WILL
TRY TO MAKE THIS CLEARER BY AN EXAMPLE THE ODD NUMBER IS ALWAYS CALLED
BY THE NAME OF ODD
VERY TRUE
BUT IS THIS THE ONLY THING WHICH IS CALLED ODD ARE THERE NOT OTHER
THINGS WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN NAME AND YET ARE CALLED ODD BECAUSE
ALTHOUGH NOT THE SAME AS ODDNESS THEY ARE NEVER WITHOUT ODDNESS THAT
IS WHAT I MEAN TO ASK WHETHER NUMBERS SUCH AS THE NUMBER THREE ARE NOT
OF THE CLASS OF ODD
AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES WOULD YOU NOT
SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THREE MAY BE CALLED BY ITS PROPER NAME AND ALSO
BE CALLED ODD WHICH IS NOT THE SAME WITH THREE AND THIS MAY BE SAID
NOT ONLY OF THREE BUT ALSO OF FIVE AND OF EVERY ALTERNATE NUMBER EACH
OF THEM WITHOUT BEING ODDNESS IS ODD AND IN THE SAME WAY TWO AND
FOUR AND THE OTHER SERIES OF ALTERNATE NUMBERS HAS EVERY NUMBER EVEN
WITHOUT BEING EVENNESS
DO YOU AGREE
OF COURSE
THEN NOW MARK THE POINT AT WHICH I AM AIMING NOT ONLY DO ESSENTIAL
OPPOSITES EXCLUDE ONE ANOTHER BUT ALSO CONCRETE THINGS WHICH ALTHOUGH
NOT IN THEMSELVES OPPOSED CONTAIN OPPOSITES THESE I SAY LIKEWISE
REJECT THE IDEA WHICH IS OPPOSED TO THAT WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THEM
AND WHEN IT APPROACHES THEM THEY EITHER PERISH OR WITHDRAW
FOR EXAMPLE
WILL NOT THE NUMBER THREE ENDURE ANNIHILATION OR ANYTHING SOONER THAN BE
CONVERTED INTO AN EVEN NUMBER WHILE REMAINING THREE
VERY TRUE SAID CEBES
AND YET HE SAID THE NUMBER TWO IS CERTAINLY NOT OPPOSED TO THE NUMBER
THREE
IT IS NOT
THEN NOT ONLY DO OPPOSITE IDEAS REPEL THE ADVANCE OF ONE ANOTHER BUT
ALSO THERE ARE OTHER NATURES WHICH REPEL THE APPROACH OF OPPOSITES
VERY TRUE HE SAID
SUPPOSE HE SAID THAT WE ENDEAVOUR IF POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT
THESE ARE
BY ALL MEANS
ARE THEY NOT CEBES SUCH AS COMPEL THE THINGS OF WHICH THEY HAVE
POSSESSION NOT ONLY TO TAKE THEIR OWN FORM BUT ALSO THE FORM OF SOME
OPPOSITE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I MEAN AS I WAS JUST NOW SAYING AND AS I AM SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT
THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE POSSESSED BY THE NUMBER THREE MUST NOT ONLY BE
THREE IN NUMBER BUT MUST ALSO BE ODD
QUITE TRUE
AND ON THIS ODDNESS OF WHICH THE NUMBER THREE HAS THE IMPRESS THE
OPPOSITE IDEA WILL NEVER INTRUDE
NO
AND THIS IMPRESS WAS GIVEN BY THE ODD PRINCIPLE
YES
AND TO THE ODD IS OPPOSED THE EVEN
TRUE
THEN THE IDEA OF THE EVEN NUMBER WILL NEVER ARRIVE AT THREE
NO
THEN THREE HAS NO PART IN THE EVEN
NONE
THEN THE TRIAD OR NUMBER THREE IS UNEVEN
VERY TRUE
TO RETURN THEN TO MY DISTINCTION OF NATURES WHICH ARE NOT OPPOSED AND
YET DO NOT ADMIT OPPOSITES AS IN THE INSTANCE GIVEN THREE ALTHOUGH
NOT OPPOSED TO THE EVEN DOES NOT ANY THE MORE ADMIT OF THE EVEN BUT
ALWAYS BRINGS THE OPPOSITE INTO PLAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OR AS TWO DOES
NOT RECEIVE THE ODD OR FIRE THE COLD FROM THESE EXAMPLES AND THERE
ARE MANY MORE OF THEM PERHAPS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ARRIVE AT THE GENERAL
CONCLUSION THAT NOT ONLY OPPOSITES WILL NOT RECEIVE OPPOSITES BUT ALSO
THAT NOTHING WHICH BRINGS THE OPPOSITE WILL ADMIT THE OPPOSITE OF
THAT WHICH IT BRINGS IN THAT TO WHICH IT IS BROUGHT
AND HERE LET ME
RECAPITULATE FOR THERE IS NO HARM IN REPETITION
THE NUMBER FIVE WILL
NOT ADMIT THE NATURE OF THE EVEN ANY MORE THAN TEN WHICH IS THE
DOUBLE OF FIVE WILL ADMIT THE NATURE OF THE ODD
THE DOUBLE HAS ANOTHER
OPPOSITE AND IS NOT STRICTLY OPPOSED TO THE ODD BUT NEVERTHELESS
REJECTS THE ODD ALTOGETHER
NOR AGAIN WILL PARTS IN THE RATIO 3 2 NOR
ANY FRACTION IN WHICH THERE IS A HALF NOR AGAIN IN WHICH THERE IS A
THIRD ADMIT THE NOTION OF THE WHOLE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO
THE WHOLE YOU WILL AGREE
YES HE SAID I ENTIRELY AGREE AND GO ALONG WITH YOU IN THAT
AND NOW HE SAID LET US BEGIN AGAIN AND DO NOT YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION
IN THE WORDS IN WHICH I ASK IT LET ME HAVE NOT THE OLD SAFE ANSWER OF
WHICH I SPOKE AT FIRST BUT ANOTHER EQUALLY SAFE OF WHICH THE TRUTH
WILL BE INFERRED BY YOU FROM WHAT HAS BEEN JUST SAID
I MEAN THAT IF ANY
ONE ASKS YOU 'WHAT THAT IS OF WHICH THE INHERENCE MAKES THE BODY
HOT YOU WILL REPLY NOT HEAT THIS IS WHAT I CALL THE SAFE AND
STUPID ANSWER BUT FIRE A FAR SUPERIOR ANSWER WHICH WE ARE NOW IN A
CONDITION TO GIVE
OR IF ANY ONE ASKS YOU 'WHY A BODY IS DISEASED YOU
WILL NOT SAY FROM DISEASE BUT FROM FEVER AND INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT
ODDNESS IS THE CAUSE OF ODD NUMBERS YOU WILL SAY THAT THE MONAD IS THE
CAUSE OF THEM AND SO OF THINGS IN GENERAL AS I DARE SAY THAT YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND SUFFICIENTLY WITHOUT MY ADDUCING ANY FURTHER EXAMPLES
YES HE SAID I QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU
TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THAT OF WHICH THE INHERENCE WILL RENDER THE BODY
ALIVE
THE SOUL HE REPLIED
AND IS THIS ALWAYS THE CASE
YES HE SAID OF COURSE
THEN WHATEVER THE SOUL POSSESSES TO THAT SHE COMES BEARING LIFE
YES CERTAINLY
AND IS THERE ANY OPPOSITE TO LIFE
THERE IS HE SAID
AND WHAT IS THAT
DEATH
THEN THE SOUL AS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED WILL NEVER RECEIVE THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT SHE BRINGS
IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED CEBES
AND NOW HE SAID WHAT DID WE JUST NOW CALL THAT PRINCIPLE WHICH REPELS
THE EVEN
THE ODD
AND THAT PRINCIPLE WHICH REPELS THE MUSICAL OR THE JUST
THE UNMUSICAL HE SAID AND THE UNJUST
AND WHAT DO WE CALL THE PRINCIPLE WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF DEATH
THE IMMORTAL HE SAID
AND DOES THE SOUL ADMIT OF DEATH
NO
THEN THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL
YES HE SAID
AND MAY WE SAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN PROVEN
YES ABUNDANTLY PROVEN SOCRATES HE REPLIED
SUPPOSING THAT THE ODD WERE IMPERISHABLE MUST NOT THREE BE
IMPERISHABLE
OF COURSE
AND IF THAT WHICH IS COLD WERE IMPERISHABLE WHEN THE WARM PRINCIPLE
CAME ATTACKING THE SNOW MUST NOT THE SNOW HAVE RETIRED WHOLE AND
UNMELTED FOR IT COULD NEVER HAVE PERISHED NOR COULD IT HAVE REMAINED
AND ADMITTED THE HEAT
TRUE HE SAID
AGAIN IF THE UNCOOLING OR WARM PRINCIPLE WERE IMPERISHABLE THE FIRE
WHEN ASSAILED BY COLD WOULD NOT HAVE PERISHED OR HAVE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
BUT WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY UNAFFECTED
CERTAINLY HE SAID
AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE IMMORTAL IF THE IMMORTAL IS ALSO
IMPERISHABLE THE SOUL WHEN ATTACKED BY DEATH CANNOT PERISH FOR THE
PRECEDING ARGUMENT SHOWS THAT THE SOUL WILL NOT ADMIT OF DEATH OR EVER
BE DEAD ANY MORE THAN THREE OR THE ODD NUMBER WILL ADMIT OF THE EVEN
OR FIRE OR THE HEAT IN THE FIRE OF THE COLD
YET A PERSON MAY SAY 'BUT
ALTHOUGH THE ODD WILL NOT BECOME EVEN AT THE APPROACH OF THE EVEN WHY
MAY NOT THE ODD PERISH AND THE EVEN TAKE THE PLACE OF THE ODD NOW TO
HIM WHO MAKES THIS OBJECTION WE CANNOT ANSWER THAT THE ODD PRINCIPLE IS
IMPERISHABLE FOR THIS HAS NOT BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN
ACKNOWLEDGED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO DIFFICULTY IN CONTENDING THAT
AT THE APPROACH OF THE EVEN THE ODD PRINCIPLE AND THE NUMBER THREE TOOK
THEIR DEPARTURE AND THE SAME ARGUMENT WOULD HAVE HELD GOOD OF FIRE AND
HEAT AND ANY OTHER THING
VERY TRUE
AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE IMMORTAL IF THE IMMORTAL IS ALSO
IMPERISHABLE THEN THE SOUL WILL BE IMPERISHABLE AS WELL AS IMMORTAL
BUT IF NOT SOME OTHER PROOF OF HER IMPERISHABLENESS WILL HAVE TO BE
GIVEN
NO OTHER PROOF IS NEEDED HE SAID FOR IF THE IMMORTAL BEING ETERNAL
IS LIABLE TO PERISH THEN NOTHING IS IMPERISHABLE
YES REPLIED SOCRATES AND YET ALL MEN WILL AGREE THAT GOD AND THE
ESSENTIAL FORM OF LIFE AND THE IMMORTAL IN GENERAL WILL NEVER PERISH
YES ALL MEN HE SAID THAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS MORE GODS IF I AM NOT
MISTAKEN AS WELL AS MEN
SEEING THEN THAT THE IMMORTAL IS INDESTRUCTIBLE MUST NOT THE SOUL IF
SHE IS IMMORTAL BE ALSO IMPERISHABLE
MOST CERTAINLY
THEN WHEN DEATH ATTACKS A MAN THE MORTAL PORTION OF HIM MAY BE SUPPOSED
TO DIE BUT THE IMMORTAL RETIRES AT THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND IS
PRESERVED SAFE AND SOUND
TRUE
THEN CEBES BEYOND QUESTION THE SOUL IS IMMORTAL AND IMPERISHABLE AND
OUR SOULS WILL TRULY EXIST IN ANOTHER WORLD
I AM CONVINCED SOCRATES SAID CEBES AND HAVE NOTHING MORE TO OBJECT
BUT IF MY FRIEND SIMMIAS OR ANY ONE ELSE HAS ANY FURTHER OBJECTION TO
MAKE HE HAD BETTER SPEAK OUT AND NOT KEEP SILENCE SINCE I DO NOT KNOW
TO WHAT OTHER SEASON HE CAN DEFER THE DISCUSSION IF THERE IS ANYTHING
WHICH HE WANTS TO SAY OR TO HAVE SAID
BUT I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY REPLIED SIMMIAS NOR CAN I SEE ANY
REASON FOR DOUBT AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID
BUT I STILL FEEL AND CANNOT
HELP FEELING UNCERTAIN IN MY OWN MIND WHEN I THINK OF THE GREATNESS OF
THE SUBJECT AND THE FEEBLENESS OF MAN
YES SIMMIAS REPLIED SOCRATES THAT IS WELL SAID AND I MAY ADD THAT
FIRST PRINCIPLES EVEN IF THEY APPEAR CERTAIN SHOULD BE CAREFULLY
CONSIDERED AND WHEN THEY ARE SATISFACTORILY ASCERTAINED THEN WITH A
SORT OF HESITATING CONFIDENCE IN HUMAN REASON YOU MAY I THINK FOLLOW
THE COURSE OF THE ARGUMENT AND IF THAT BE PLAIN AND CLEAR THERE WILL
BE NO NEED FOR ANY FURTHER ENQUIRY
VERY TRUE
BUT THEN O MY FRIENDS HE SAID IF THE SOUL IS REALLY IMMORTAL WHAT
CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN OF HER NOT ONLY IN RESPECT OF THE PORTION OF TIME
WHICH IS CALLED LIFE BUT OF ETERNITY AND THE DANGER OF NEGLECTING HER
FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW DOES INDEED APPEAR TO BE AWFUL
IF DEATH HAD
ONLY BEEN THE END OF ALL THE WICKED WOULD HAVE HAD A GOOD BARGAIN IN
DYING FOR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPILY QUIT NOT ONLY OF THEIR BODY BUT
OF THEIR OWN EVIL TOGETHER WITH THEIR SOULS
BUT NOW INASMUCH AS THE
SOUL IS MANIFESTLY IMMORTAL THERE IS NO RELEASE OR SALVATION FROM EVIL
EXCEPT THE ATTAINMENT OF THE HIGHEST VIRTUE AND WISDOM
FOR THE SOUL
WHEN ON HER PROGRESS TO THE WORLD BELOW TAKES NOTHING WITH HER BUT
NURTURE AND EDUCATION AND THESE ARE SAID GREATLY TO BENEFIT OR GREATLY
TO INJURE THE DEPARTED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF HIS JOURNEY THITHER
FOR AFTER DEATH AS THEY SAY THE GENIUS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL TO WHOM
HE BELONGED IN LIFE LEADS HIM TO A CERTAIN PLACE IN WHICH THE DEAD ARE
GATHERED TOGETHER WHENCE AFTER JUDGMENT HAS BEEN GIVEN THEY PASS INTO
THE WORLD BELOW FOLLOWING THE GUIDE WHO IS APPOINTED TO CONDUCT THEM
FROM THIS WORLD TO THE OTHER AND WHEN THEY HAVE THERE RECEIVED THEIR
DUE AND REMAINED THEIR TIME ANOTHER GUIDE BRINGS THEM BACK AGAIN AFTER
MANY REVOLUTIONS OF AGES
NOW THIS WAY TO THE OTHER WORLD IS NOT AS
AESCHYLUS SAYS IN THE TELEPHUS A SINGLE AND STRAIGHT PATH IF THAT WERE
SO NO GUIDE WOULD BE NEEDED FOR NO ONE COULD MISS IT BUT THERE ARE
MANY PARTINGS OF THE ROAD AND WINDINGS AS I INFER FROM THE RITES AND
SACRIFICES WHICH ARE OFFERED TO THE GODS BELOW IN PLACES WHERE THREE
WAYS MEET ON EARTH
THE WISE AND ORDERLY SOUL FOLLOWS IN THE STRAIGHT
PATH AND IS CONSCIOUS OF HER SURROUNDINGS BUT THE SOUL WHICH DESIRES
THE BODY AND WHICH AS I WAS RELATING BEFORE HAS LONG BEEN FLUTTERING
ABOUT THE LIFELESS FRAME AND THE WORLD OF SIGHT IS AFTER MANY STRUGGLES
AND MANY SUFFERINGS HARDLY AND WITH VIOLENCE CARRIED AWAY BY HER
ATTENDANT GENIUS AND WHEN SHE ARRIVES AT THE PLACE WHERE THE OTHER
SOULS ARE GATHERED IF SHE BE IMPURE AND HAVE DONE IMPURE DEEDS WHETHER
FOUL MURDERS OR OTHER CRIMES WHICH ARE THE BROTHERS OF THESE AND THE
WORKS OF BROTHERS IN CRIME FROM THAT SOUL EVERY ONE FLEES AND TURNS
AWAY NO ONE WILL BE HER COMPANION NO ONE HER GUIDE BUT ALONE SHE
WANDERS IN EXTREMITY OF EVIL UNTIL CERTAIN TIMES ARE FULFILLED AND
WHEN THEY ARE FULFILLED SHE IS BORNE IRRESISTIBLY TO HER OWN FITTING
HABITATION AS EVERY PURE AND JUST SOUL WHICH HAS PASSED THROUGH LIFE IN
THE COMPANY AND UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE GODS HAS ALSO HER OWN PROPER
HOME
NOW THE EARTH HAS DIVERS WONDERFUL REGIONS AND IS INDEED IN NATURE
AND EXTENT VERY UNLIKE THE NOTIONS OF GEOGRAPHERS AS I BELIEVE ON THE
AUTHORITY OF ONE WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOCRATES SAID SIMMIAS
I HAVE MYSELF HEARD MANY
DESCRIPTIONS OF THE EARTH BUT I DO NOT KNOW AND I SHOULD VERY MUCH
LIKE TO KNOW IN WHICH OF THESE YOU PUT FAITH
AND I SIMMIAS REPLIED SOCRATES IF I HAD THE ART OF GLAUCUS WOULD TELL
YOU ALTHOUGH I KNOW NOT THAT THE ART OF GLAUCUS COULD PROVE THE TRUTH
OF MY TALE WHICH I MYSELF SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PROVE AND EVEN IF
I COULD I FEAR SIMMIAS THAT MY LIFE WOULD COME TO AN END BEFORE THE
ARGUMENT WAS COMPLETED
I MAY DESCRIBE TO YOU HOWEVER THE FORM AND
REGIONS OF THE EARTH ACCORDING TO MY CONCEPTION OF THEM
THAT SAID SIMMIAS WILL BE ENOUGH
WELL THEN HE SAID MY CONVICTION IS THAT THE EARTH IS A ROUND BODY
IN THE CENTRE OF THE HEAVENS AND THEREFORE HAS NO NEED OF AIR OR ANY
SIMILAR FORCE TO BE A SUPPORT BUT IS KEPT THERE AND HINDERED FROM
FALLING OR INCLINING ANY WAY BY THE EQUABILITY OF THE SURROUNDING HEAVEN
AND BY HER OWN EQUIPOISE
FOR THAT WHICH BEING IN EQUIPOISE IS IN THE
CENTRE OF THAT WHICH IS EQUABLY DIFFUSED WILL NOT INCLINE ANY WAY IN
ANY DEGREE BUT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN IN THE SAME STATE AND NOT DEVIATE
AND THIS IS MY FIRST NOTION
WHICH IS SURELY A CORRECT ONE SAID SIMMIAS
ALSO I BELIEVE THAT THE EARTH IS VERY VAST AND THAT WE WHO DWELL IN
THE REGION EXTENDING FROM THE RIVER PHASIS TO THE PILLARS OF HERACLES
INHABIT A SMALL PORTION ONLY ABOUT THE SEA LIKE ANTS OR FROGS ABOUT A
MARSH AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER INHABITANTS OF MANY OTHER LIKE PLACES
FOR EVERYWHERE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH THERE ARE HOLLOWS OF VARIOUS
FORMS AND SIZES INTO WHICH THE WATER AND THE MIST AND THE LOWER
AIR COLLECT
BUT THE TRUE EARTH IS PURE AND SITUATED IN THE PURE
HEAVEN THERE ARE THE STARS ALSO AND IT IS THE HEAVEN WHICH IS COMMONLY
SPOKEN OF BY US AS THE ETHER AND OF WHICH OUR OWN EARTH IS THE SEDIMENT
GATHERING IN THE HOLLOWS BENEATH
BUT WE WHO LIVE IN THESE HOLLOWS ARE
DECEIVED INTO THE NOTION THAT WE ARE DWELLING ABOVE ON THE SURFACE OF
THE EARTH WHICH IS JUST AS IF A CREATURE WHO WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
SEA WERE TO FANCY THAT HE WAS ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND THAT THE
SEA WAS THE HEAVEN THROUGH WHICH HE SAW THE SUN AND THE OTHER STARS
HE HAVING NEVER COME TO THE SURFACE BY REASON OF HIS FEEBLENESS AND
SLUGGISHNESS AND HAVING NEVER LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND SEEN NOR EVER
HEARD FROM ONE WHO HAD SEEN HOW MUCH PURER AND FAIRER THE WORLD ABOVE
IS THAN HIS OWN
AND SUCH IS EXACTLY OUR CASE FOR WE ARE DWELLING IN A
HOLLOW OF THE EARTH AND FANCY THAT WE ARE ON THE SURFACE AND THE AIR
WE CALL THE HEAVEN IN WHICH WE IMAGINE THAT THE STARS MOVE
BUT THE
FACT IS THAT OWING TO OUR FEEBLENESS AND SLUGGISHNESS WE ARE PREVENTED
FROM REACHING THE SURFACE OF THE AIR FOR IF ANY MAN COULD ARRIVE AT THE
EXTERIOR LIMIT OR TAKE THE WINGS OF A BIRD AND COME TO THE TOP THEN
LIKE A FISH WHO PUTS HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WATER AND SEES THIS WORLD HE
WOULD SEE A WORLD BEYOND AND IF THE NATURE OF MAN COULD SUSTAIN THE
SIGHT HE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS OTHER WORLD WAS THE PLACE OF THE
TRUE HEAVEN AND THE TRUE LIGHT AND THE TRUE EARTH
FOR OUR EARTH AND
THE STONES AND THE ENTIRE REGION WHICH SURROUNDS US ARE SPOILT AND
CORRODED AS IN THE SEA ALL THINGS ARE CORRODED BY THE BRINE NEITHER
IS THERE ANY NOBLE OR PERFECT GROWTH BUT CAVERNS ONLY AND SAND AND AN
ENDLESS SLOUGH OF MUD AND EVEN THE SHORE IS NOT TO BE COMPARED TO THE
FAIRER SIGHTS OF THIS WORLD
AND STILL LESS IS THIS OUR WORLD TO BE
COMPARED WITH THE OTHER
OF THAT UPPER EARTH WHICH IS UNDER THE HEAVEN
I CAN TELL YOU A CHARMING TALE SIMMIAS WHICH IS WELL WORTH HEARING
AND WE SOCRATES REPLIED SIMMIAS SHALL BE CHARMED TO LISTEN TO YOU
THE TALE MY FRIEND HE SAID IS AS FOLLOWS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE
EARTH WHEN LOOKED AT FROM ABOVE IS IN APPEARANCE STREAKED LIKE ONE OF
THOSE BALLS WHICH HAVE LEATHER COVERINGS IN TWELVE PIECES AND IS DECKED
WITH VARIOUS COLOURS OF WHICH THE COLOURS USED BY PAINTERS ON EARTH ARE
IN A MANNER SAMPLES
BUT THERE THE WHOLE EARTH IS MADE UP OF THEM
AND THEY ARE BRIGHTER FAR AND CLEARER THAN OURS THERE IS A PURPLE OF
WONDERFUL LUSTRE ALSO THE RADIANCE OF GOLD AND THE WHITE WHICH IS IN
THE EARTH IS WHITER THAN ANY CHALK OR SNOW
OF THESE AND OTHER COLOURS
THE EARTH IS MADE UP AND THEY ARE MORE IN NUMBER AND FAIRER THAN THE
EYE OF MAN HAS EVER SEEN THE VERY HOLLOWS OF WHICH I WAS SPEAKING
FILLED WITH AIR AND WATER HAVE A COLOUR OF THEIR OWN AND ARE SEEN LIKE
LIGHT GLEAMING AMID THE DIVERSITY OF THE OTHER COLOURS SO THAT THE
WHOLE PRESENTS A SINGLE AND CONTINUOUS APPEARANCE OF VARIETY IN UNITY
AND IN THIS FAIR REGION EVERYTHING THAT GROWS TREES AND FLOWERS AND
FRUITS ARE IN A LIKE DEGREE FAIRER THAN ANY HERE AND THERE ARE HILLS
HAVING STONES IN THEM IN A LIKE DEGREE SMOOTHER AND MORE TRANSPARENT
AND FAIRER IN COLOUR THAN OUR HIGHLY VALUED EMERALDS AND SARDONYXES AND
JASPERS AND OTHER GEMS WHICH ARE BUT MINUTE FRAGMENTS OF THEM FOR
THERE ALL THE STONES ARE LIKE OUR PRECIOUS STONES AND FAIRER STILL
COMPARE REPUBLIC
THE REASON IS THAT THEY ARE PURE AND NOT LIKE
OUR PRECIOUS STONES INFECTED OR CORRODED BY THE CORRUPT BRINY ELEMENTS
WHICH COAGULATE AMONG US AND WHICH BREED FOULNESS AND DISEASE BOTH IN
EARTH AND STONES AS WELL AS IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS
THEY ARE THE JEWELS
OF THE UPPER EARTH WHICH ALSO SHINES WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND THE LIKE
AND THEY ARE SET IN THE LIGHT OF DAY AND ARE LARGE AND ABUNDANT AND IN
ALL PLACES MAKING THE EARTH A SIGHT TO GLADDEN THE BEHOLDER'S EYE
AND THERE ARE ANIMALS AND MEN SOME IN A MIDDLE REGION OTHERS DWELLING
ABOUT THE AIR AS WE DWELL ABOUT THE SEA OTHERS IN ISLANDS WHICH THE AIR
FLOWS ROUND NEAR THE CONTINENT AND IN A WORD THE AIR IS USED BY THEM
AS THE WATER AND THE SEA ARE BY US AND THE ETHER IS TO THEM WHAT THE
AIR IS TO US
MOREOVER THE TEMPERAMENT OF THEIR SEASONS IS SUCH THAT
THEY HAVE NO DISEASE AND LIVE MUCH LONGER THAN WE DO AND HAVE
SIGHT AND HEARING AND SMELL AND ALL THE OTHER SENSES IN FAR GREATER
PERFECTION IN THE SAME PROPORTION THAT AIR IS PURER THAN WATER OR THE
ETHER THAN AIR
ALSO THEY HAVE TEMPLES AND SACRED PLACES IN WHICH THE
GODS REALLY DWELL AND THEY HEAR THEIR VOICES AND RECEIVE THEIR ANSWERS
AND ARE CONSCIOUS OF THEM AND HOLD CONVERSE WITH THEM AND THEY SEE THE
SUN MOON AND STARS AS THEY TRULY ARE AND THEIR OTHER BLESSEDNESS IS
OF A PIECE WITH THIS
SUCH IS THE NATURE OF THE WHOLE EARTH AND OF THE THINGS WHICH ARE
AROUND THE EARTH AND THERE ARE DIVERS REGIONS IN THE HOLLOWS ON THE
FACE OF THE GLOBE EVERYWHERE SOME OF THEM DEEPER AND MORE EXTENDED THAN
THAT WHICH WE INHABIT OTHERS DEEPER BUT WITH A NARROWER OPENING
THAN OURS AND SOME ARE SHALLOWER AND ALSO WIDER
ALL HAVE NUMEROUS
PERFORATIONS AND THERE ARE PASSAGES BROAD AND NARROW IN THE INTERIOR OF
THE EARTH CONNECTING THEM WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THERE FLOWS OUT OF AND
INTO THEM AS INTO BASINS A VAST TIDE OF WATER AND HUGE SUBTERRANEAN
STREAMS OF PERENNIAL RIVERS AND SPRINGS HOT AND COLD AND A GREAT FIRE
AND GREAT RIVERS OF FIRE AND STREAMS OF LIQUID MUD THIN OR THICK LIKE
THE RIVERS OF MUD IN SICILY AND THE LAVA STREAMS WHICH FOLLOW THEM
AND THE REGIONS ABOUT WHICH THEY HAPPEN TO FLOW ARE FILLED UP WITH THEM
AND THERE IS A SWINGING OR SEE SAW IN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH WHICH
MOVES ALL THIS UP AND DOWN AND IS DUE TO THE FOLLOWING CAUSE THERE IS
A CHASM WHICH IS THE VASTEST OF THEM ALL AND PIERCES RIGHT THROUGH THE
WHOLE EARTH THIS IS THAT CHASM WHICH HOMER DESCRIBES IN THE WORDS
'FAR OFF WHERE IS THE INMOST DEPTH BENEATH THE EARTH
AND WHICH HE IN OTHER PLACES AND MANY OTHER POETS HAVE CALLED
TARTARUS
AND THE SEE SAW IS CAUSED BY THE STREAMS FLOWING INTO AND OUT
OF THIS CHASM AND THEY EACH HAVE THE NATURE OF THE SOIL THROUGH WHICH
THEY FLOW
AND THE REASON WHY THE STREAMS ARE ALWAYS FLOWING IN AND OUT
IS THAT THE WATERY ELEMENT HAS NO BED OR BOTTOM BUT IS SWINGING AND
SURGING UP AND DOWN AND THE SURROUNDING WIND AND AIR DO THE SAME THEY
FOLLOW THE WATER UP AND DOWN HITHER AND THITHER OVER THE EARTH JUST
AS IN THE ACT OF RESPIRATION THE AIR IS ALWAYS IN PROCESS OF INHALATION
AND EXHALATION AND THE WIND SWINGING WITH THE WATER IN AND OUT
PRODUCES FEARFUL AND IRRESISTIBLE BLASTS WHEN THE WATERS RETIRE WITH
A RUSH INTO THE LOWER PARTS OF THE EARTH AS THEY ARE CALLED THEY FLOW
THROUGH THE EARTH IN THOSE REGIONS AND FILL THEM UP LIKE WATER RAISED
BY A PUMP AND THEN WHEN THEY LEAVE THOSE REGIONS AND RUSH BACK HITHER
THEY AGAIN FILL THE HOLLOWS HERE AND WHEN THESE ARE FILLED FLOW
THROUGH SUBTERRANEAN CHANNELS AND FIND THEIR WAY TO THEIR SEVERAL
PLACES FORMING SEAS AND LAKES AND RIVERS AND SPRINGS
THENCE THEY
AGAIN ENTER THE EARTH SOME OF THEM MAKING A LONG CIRCUIT INTO MANY
LANDS OTHERS GOING TO A FEW PLACES AND NOT SO DISTANT AND AGAIN FALL
INTO TARTARUS SOME AT A POINT A GOOD DEAL LOWER THAN THAT AT WHICH THEY
ROSE AND OTHERS NOT MUCH LOWER BUT ALL IN SOME DEGREE LOWER THAN THE
POINT FROM WHICH THEY CAME
AND SOME BURST FORTH AGAIN ON THE OPPOSITE
SIDE AND SOME ON THE SAME SIDE AND SOME WIND ROUND THE EARTH WITH ONE
OR MANY FOLDS LIKE THE COILS OF A SERPENT AND DESCEND AS FAR AS THEY
CAN BUT ALWAYS RETURN AND FALL INTO THE CHASM
THE RIVERS FLOWING IN
EITHER DIRECTION CAN DESCEND ONLY TO THE CENTRE AND NO FURTHER FOR
OPPOSITE TO THE RIVERS IS A PRECIPICE
NOW THESE RIVERS ARE MANY AND MIGHTY AND DIVERSE AND THERE ARE FOUR
PRINCIPAL ONES OF WHICH THE GREATEST AND OUTERMOST IS THAT CALLED
OCEANUS WHICH FLOWS ROUND THE EARTH IN A CIRCLE AND IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION FLOWS ACHERON WHICH PASSES UNDER THE EARTH THROUGH DESERT
PLACES INTO THE ACHERUSIAN LAKE THIS IS THE LAKE TO THE SHORES OF
WHICH THE SOULS OF THE MANY GO WHEN THEY ARE DEAD AND AFTER WAITING AN
APPOINTED TIME WHICH IS TO SOME A LONGER AND TO SOME A SHORTER TIME
THEY ARE SENT BACK TO BE BORN AGAIN AS ANIMALS
THE THIRD RIVER PASSES
OUT BETWEEN THE TWO AND NEAR THE PLACE OF OUTLET POURS INTO A VAST
REGION OF FIRE AND FORMS A LAKE LARGER THAN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
BOILING WITH WATER AND MUD AND PROCEEDING MUDDY AND TURBID AND WINDING
ABOUT THE EARTH COMES AMONG OTHER PLACES TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE
ACHERUSIAN LAKE BUT MINGLES NOT WITH THE WATERS OF THE LAKE AND AFTER
MAKING MANY COILS ABOUT THE EARTH PLUNGES INTO TARTARUS AT A DEEPER
LEVEL
THIS IS THAT PYRIPHLEGETHON AS THE STREAM IS CALLED WHICH
THROWS UP JETS OF FIRE IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE EARTH
THE FOURTH RIVER
GOES OUT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND FALLS FIRST OF ALL INTO A WILD AND
SAVAGE REGION WHICH IS ALL OF A DARK BLUE COLOUR LIKE LAPIS LAZULI
AND THIS IS THAT RIVER WHICH IS CALLED THE STYGIAN RIVER AND FALLS INTO
AND FORMS THE LAKE STYX AND AFTER FALLING INTO THE LAKE AND RECEIVING
STRANGE POWERS IN THE WATERS PASSES UNDER THE EARTH WINDING ROUND
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND COMES NEAR THE ACHERUSIAN LAKE FROM THE
OPPOSITE SIDE TO PYRIPHLEGETHON
AND THE WATER OF THIS RIVER TOO MINGLES
WITH NO OTHER BUT FLOWS ROUND IN A CIRCLE AND FALLS INTO TARTARUS OVER
AGAINST PYRIPHLEGETHON AND THE NAME OF THE RIVER AS THE POETS SAY IS
COCYTUS
SUCH IS THE NATURE OF THE OTHER WORLD AND WHEN THE DEAD ARRIVE AT THE
PLACE TO WHICH THE GENIUS OF EACH SEVERALLY GUIDES THEM FIRST OF ALL
THEY HAVE SENTENCE PASSED UPON THEM AS THEY HAVE LIVED WELL AND PIOUSLY
OR NOT
AND THOSE WHO APPEAR TO HAVE LIVED NEITHER WELL NOR ILL GO TO
THE RIVER ACHERON AND EMBARKING IN ANY VESSELS WHICH THEY MAY FIND ARE
CARRIED IN THEM TO THE LAKE AND THERE THEY DWELL AND ARE PURIFIED OF
THEIR EVIL DEEDS AND HAVING SUFFERED THE PENALTY OF THE WRONGS WHICH
THEY HAVE DONE TO OTHERS THEY ARE ABSOLVED AND RECEIVE THE REWARDS OF
THEIR GOOD DEEDS EACH OF THEM ACCORDING TO HIS DESERTS
BUT THOSE WHO
APPEAR TO BE INCURABLE BY REASON OF THE GREATNESS OF THEIR CRIMES WHO
HAVE COMMITTED MANY AND TERRIBLE DEEDS OF SACRILEGE MURDERS FOUL AND
VIOLENT OR THE LIKE SUCH ARE HURLED INTO TARTARUS WHICH IS THEIR
SUITABLE DESTINY AND THEY NEVER COME OUT
THOSE AGAIN WHO HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES WHICH ALTHOUGH GREAT ARE NOT IRREMEDIABLE WHO IN
A MOMENT OF ANGER FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DONE VIOLENCE TO A FATHER OR A
MOTHER AND HAVE REPENTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR LIVES OR WHO
HAVE TAKEN THE LIFE OF ANOTHER UNDER THE LIKE EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES THESE ARE PLUNGED INTO TARTARUS THE PAINS OF WHICH THEY
ARE COMPELLED TO UNDERGO FOR A YEAR BUT AT THE END OF THE YEAR THE
WAVE CASTS THEM FORTH MERE HOMICIDES BY WAY OF COCYTUS PARRICIDES AND
MATRICIDES BY PYRIPHLEGETHON AND THEY ARE BORNE TO THE ACHERUSIAN LAKE
AND THERE THEY LIFT UP THEIR VOICES AND CALL UPON THE VICTIMS WHOM THEY
HAVE SLAIN OR WRONGED TO HAVE PITY ON THEM AND TO BE KIND TO THEM
AND LET THEM COME OUT INTO THE LAKE
AND IF THEY PREVAIL THEN THEY COME
FORTH AND CEASE FROM THEIR TROUBLES BUT IF NOT THEY ARE CARRIED BACK
AGAIN INTO TARTARUS AND FROM THENCE INTO THE RIVERS UNCEASINGLY UNTIL
THEY OBTAIN MERCY FROM THOSE WHOM THEY HAVE WRONGED FOR THAT IS THE
SENTENCE INFLICTED UPON THEM BY THEIR JUDGES
THOSE TOO WHO HAVE BEEN
PRE EMINENT FOR HOLINESS OF LIFE ARE RELEASED FROM THIS EARTHLY PRISON
AND GO TO THEIR PURE HOME WHICH IS ABOVE AND DWELL IN THE PURER EARTH
AND OF THESE SUCH AS HAVE DULY PURIFIED THEMSELVES WITH PHILOSOPHY LIVE
HENCEFORTH ALTOGETHER WITHOUT THE BODY IN MANSIONS FAIRER STILL WHICH
MAY NOT BE DESCRIBED AND OF WHICH THE TIME WOULD FAIL ME TO TELL
WHEREFORE SIMMIAS SEEING ALL THESE THINGS WHAT OUGHT NOT WE TO DO
THAT WE MAY OBTAIN VIRTUE AND WISDOM IN THIS LIFE FAIR IS THE PRIZE
AND THE HOPE GREAT
A MAN OF SENSE OUGHT NOT TO SAY NOR WILL I BE VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE
DESCRIPTION WHICH I HAVE GIVEN OF THE SOUL AND HER MANSIONS IS EXACTLY
TRUE
BUT I DO SAY THAT INASMUCH AS THE SOUL IS SHOWN TO BE IMMORTAL
HE MAY VENTURE TO THINK NOT IMPROPERLY OR UNWORTHILY THAT SOMETHING OF
THE KIND IS TRUE
THE VENTURE IS A GLORIOUS ONE AND HE OUGHT TO COMFORT
HIMSELF WITH WORDS LIKE THESE WHICH IS THE REASON WHY I LENGTHEN OUT
THE TALE
WHEREFORE I SAY LET A MAN BE OF GOOD CHEER ABOUT HIS SOUL
WHO HAVING CAST AWAY THE PLEASURES AND ORNAMENTS OF THE BODY AS ALIEN TO
HIM AND WORKING HARM RATHER THAN GOOD HAS SOUGHT AFTER THE PLEASURES OF
KNOWLEDGE AND HAS ARRAYED THE SOUL NOT IN SOME FOREIGN ATTIRE BUT
IN HER OWN PROPER JEWELS TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE AND COURAGE AND
NOBILITY AND TRUTH IN THESE ADORNED SHE IS READY TO GO ON HER JOURNEY
TO THE WORLD BELOW WHEN HER HOUR COMES
YOU SIMMIAS AND CEBES AND ALL
OTHER MEN WILL DEPART AT SOME TIME OR OTHER
ME ALREADY AS THE TRAGIC
POET WOULD SAY THE VOICE OF FATE CALLS
SOON I MUST DRINK THE POISON
AND I THINK THAT I HAD BETTER REPAIR TO THE BATH FIRST IN ORDER THAT
THE WOMEN MAY NOT HAVE THE TROUBLE OF WASHING MY BODY AFTER I AM DEAD
WHEN HE HAD DONE SPEAKING CRITO SAID AND HAVE YOU ANY COMMANDS FOR US
SOCRATES ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN OR ANY OTHER MATTER IN
WHICH WE CAN SERVE YOU
NOTHING PARTICULAR CRITO HE REPLIED ONLY AS I HAVE ALWAYS TOLD
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES THAT IS A SERVICE WHICH YOU MAY BE EVER
RENDERING TO ME AND MINE AND TO ALL OF US WHETHER YOU PROMISE TO DO SO
OR NOT
BUT IF YOU HAVE NO THOUGHT FOR YOURSELVES AND CARE NOT TO WALK
ACCORDING TO THE RULE WHICH I HAVE PRESCRIBED FOR YOU NOT NOW FOR THE
FIRST TIME HOWEVER MUCH YOU MAY PROFESS OR PROMISE AT THE MOMENT IT
WILL BE OF NO AVAIL
WE WILL DO OUR BEST SAID CRITO AND IN WHAT WAY SHALL WE BURY YOU
IN ANY WAY THAT YOU LIKE BUT YOU MUST GET HOLD OF ME AND TAKE CARE
THAT I DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM YOU
THEN HE TURNED TO US AND ADDED WITH A
SMILE I CANNOT MAKE CRITO BELIEVE THAT I AM THE SAME SOCRATES WHO HAVE
BEEN TALKING AND CONDUCTING THE ARGUMENT HE FANCIES THAT I AM THE OTHER
SOCRATES WHOM HE WILL SOON SEE A DEAD BODY AND HE ASKS HOW SHALL HE
BURY ME AND THOUGH I HAVE SPOKEN MANY WORDS IN THE ENDEAVOUR TO SHOW
THAT WHEN I HAVE DRUNK THE POISON I SHALL LEAVE YOU AND GO TO THE JOYS
OF THE BLESSED THESE WORDS OF MINE WITH WHICH I WAS COMFORTING YOU
AND MYSELF HAVE HAD AS I PERCEIVE NO EFFECT UPON CRITO
AND THEREFORE
I WANT YOU TO BE SURETY FOR ME TO HIM NOW AS AT THE TRIAL HE WAS SURETY
TO THE JUDGES FOR ME BUT LET THE PROMISE BE OF ANOTHER SORT FOR HE
WAS SURETY FOR ME TO THE JUDGES THAT I WOULD REMAIN AND YOU MUST BE MY
SURETY TO HIM THAT I SHALL NOT REMAIN BUT GO AWAY AND DEPART AND THEN
HE WILL SUFFER LESS AT MY DEATH AND NOT BE GRIEVED WHEN HE SEES MY BODY
BEING BURNED OR BURIED
I WOULD NOT HAVE HIM SORROW AT MY HARD LOT OR
SAY AT THE BURIAL THUS WE LAY OUT SOCRATES OR THUS WE FOLLOW HIM TO
THE GRAVE OR BURY HIM FOR FALSE WORDS ARE NOT ONLY EVIL IN THEMSELVES
BUT THEY INFECT THE SOUL WITH EVIL
BE OF GOOD CHEER THEN MY DEAR
CRITO AND SAY THAT YOU ARE BURYING MY BODY ONLY AND DO WITH THAT
WHATEVER IS USUAL AND WHAT YOU THINK BEST
WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THESE WORDS HE AROSE AND WENT INTO A CHAMBER TO
BATHE CRITO FOLLOWED HIM AND TOLD US TO WAIT
SO WE REMAINED BEHIND
TALKING AND THINKING OF THE SUBJECT OF DISCOURSE AND ALSO OF THE
GREATNESS OF OUR SORROW HE WAS LIKE A FATHER OF WHOM WE WERE BEING
BEREAVED AND WE WERE ABOUT TO PASS THE REST OF OUR LIVES AS ORPHANS
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN THE BATH HIS CHILDREN WERE BROUGHT TO HIM HE HAD TWO
YOUNG SONS AND AN ELDER ONE AND THE WOMEN OF HIS FAMILY ALSO CAME
AND HE TALKED TO THEM AND GAVE THEM A FEW DIRECTIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF
CRITO THEN HE DISMISSED THEM AND RETURNED TO US
NOW THE HOUR OF SUNSET WAS NEAR FOR A GOOD DEAL OF TIME HAD PASSED
WHILE HE WAS WITHIN
WHEN HE CAME OUT HE SAT DOWN WITH US AGAIN AFTER
HIS BATH BUT NOT MUCH WAS SAID
SOON THE JAILER WHO WAS THE SERVANT OF
THE ELEVEN ENTERED AND STOOD BY HIM SAYING TO YOU SOCRATES WHOM
I KNOW TO BE THE NOBLEST AND GENTLEST AND BEST OF ALL WHO EVER CAME TO
THIS PLACE I WILL NOT IMPUTE THE ANGRY FEELINGS OF OTHER MEN WHO RAGE
AND SWEAR AT ME WHEN IN OBEDIENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES I BID THEM DRINK
THE POISON INDEED I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR
OTHERS AS YOU ARE AWARE AND NOT I ARE TO BLAME
AND SO FARE YOU WELL
AND TRY TO BEAR LIGHTLY WHAT MUST NEEDS BE YOU KNOW MY ERRAND
THEN
BURSTING INTO TEARS HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT OUT
SOCRATES LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID I RETURN YOUR GOOD WISHES AND WILL DO
AS YOU BID
THEN TURNING TO US HE SAID HOW CHARMING THE MAN IS SINCE
I HAVE BEEN IN PRISON HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN COMING TO SEE ME AND AT TIMES
HE WOULD TALK TO ME AND WAS AS GOOD TO ME AS COULD BE AND NOW SEE HOW
GENEROUSLY HE SORROWS ON MY ACCOUNT
WE MUST DO AS HE SAYS CRITO AND
THEREFORE LET THE CUP BE BROUGHT IF THE POISON IS PREPARED IF NOT LET
THE ATTENDANT PREPARE SOME
YET SAID CRITO THE SUN IS STILL UPON THE HILL TOPS AND I KNOW THAT
MANY A ONE HAS TAKEN THE DRAUGHT LATE AND AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT HAS
BEEN MADE TO HIM HE HAS EATEN AND DRUNK AND ENJOYED THE SOCIETY OF HIS
BELOVED DO NOT HURRY THERE IS TIME ENOUGH
SOCRATES SAID YES CRITO AND THEY OF WHOM YOU SPEAK ARE RIGHT IN SO
ACTING FOR THEY THINK THAT THEY WILL BE GAINERS BY THE DELAY BUT I AM
RIGHT IN NOT FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE FOR I DO NOT THINK THAT I SHOULD
GAIN ANYTHING BY DRINKING THE POISON A LITTLE LATER I SHOULD ONLY BE
RIDICULOUS IN MY OWN EYES FOR SPARING AND SAVING A LIFE WHICH IS ALREADY
FORFEIT
PLEASE THEN TO DO AS I SAY AND NOT TO REFUSE ME
CRITO MADE A SIGN TO THE SERVANT WHO WAS STANDING BY AND HE WENT OUT
AND HAVING BEEN ABSENT FOR SOME TIME RETURNED WITH THE JAILER
CARRYING THE CUP OF POISON
SOCRATES SAID YOU MY GOOD FRIEND WHO
ARE EXPERIENCED IN THESE MATTERS SHALL GIVE ME DIRECTIONS HOW I AM TO
PROCEED
THE MAN ANSWERED YOU HAVE ONLY TO WALK ABOUT UNTIL YOUR LEGS
ARE HEAVY AND THEN TO LIE DOWN AND THE POISON WILL ACT
AT THE SAME
TIME HE HANDED THE CUP TO SOCRATES WHO IN THE EASIEST AND GENTLEST
MANNER WITHOUT THE LEAST FEAR OR CHANGE OF COLOUR OR FEATURE LOOKING
AT THE MAN WITH ALL HIS EYES ECHECRATES AS HIS MANNER WAS TOOK THE
CUP AND SAID WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT MAKING A LIBATION OUT OF THIS CUP
TO ANY GOD MAY I OR NOT THE MAN ANSWERED WE ONLY PREPARE SOCRATES
JUST SO MUCH AS WE DEEM ENOUGH
I UNDERSTAND HE SAID BUT I MAY
AND MUST ASK THE GODS TO PROSPER MY JOURNEY FROM THIS TO THE OTHER
WORLD EVEN SO AND SO BE IT ACCORDING TO MY PRAYER
THEN RAISING THE
CUP TO HIS LIPS QUITE READILY AND CHEERFULLY HE DRANK OFF THE POISON
AND HITHERTO MOST OF US HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL OUR SORROW BUT NOW
WHEN WE SAW HIM DRINKING AND SAW TOO THAT HE HAD FINISHED THE DRAUGHT
WE COULD NO LONGER FORBEAR AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY OWN TEARS WERE
FLOWING FAST SO THAT I COVERED MY FACE AND WEPT NOT FOR HIM BUT AT
THE THOUGHT OF MY OWN CALAMITY IN HAVING TO PART FROM SUCH A FRIEND
NOR
WAS I THE FIRST FOR CRITO WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF UNABLE TO RESTRAIN HIS
TEARS HAD GOT UP AND I FOLLOWED AND AT THAT MOMENT APOLLODORUS WHO
HAD BEEN WEEPING ALL THE TIME BROKE OUT IN A LOUD AND PASSIONATE CRY
WHICH MADE COWARDS OF US ALL
SOCRATES ALONE RETAINED HIS CALMNESS WHAT
IS THIS STRANGE OUTCRY HE SAID
I SENT AWAY THE WOMEN MAINLY IN ORDER
THAT THEY MIGHT NOT MISBEHAVE IN THIS WAY FOR I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT
A MAN SHOULD DIE IN PEACE
BE QUIET THEN AND HAVE PATIENCE
WHEN WE
HEARD HIS WORDS WE WERE ASHAMED AND REFRAINED OUR TEARS AND HE WALKED
ABOUT UNTIL AS HE SAID HIS LEGS BEGAN TO FAIL AND THEN HE LAY ON HIS
BACK ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS AND THE MAN WHO GAVE HIM THE POISON
NOW AND THEN LOOKED AT HIS FEET AND LEGS AND AFTER A WHILE HE PRESSED
HIS FOOT HARD AND ASKED HIM IF HE COULD FEEL AND HE SAID NO AND THEN
HIS LEG AND SO UPWARDS AND UPWARDS AND SHOWED US THAT HE WAS COLD AND
STIFF
AND HE FELT THEM HIMSELF AND SAID WHEN THE POISON REACHES THE
HEART THAT WILL BE THE END
HE WAS BEGINNING TO GROW COLD ABOUT THE
GROIN WHEN HE UNCOVERED HIS FACE FOR HE HAD COVERED HIMSELF UP
AND SAID THEY WERE HIS LAST WORDS HE SAID CRITO I OWE A COCK TO
ASCLEPIUS WILL YOU REMEMBER TO PAY THE DEBT THE DEBT SHALL BE
PAID SAID CRITO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO
THIS QUESTION BUT IN A MINUTE OR TWO A MOVEMENT WAS HEARD AND THE
ATTENDANTS UNCOVERED HIM HIS EYES WERE SET AND CRITO CLOSED HIS EYES
AND MOUTH
SUCH WAS THE END ECHECRATES OF OUR FRIEND CONCERNING WHOM I MAY
TRULY SAY THAT OF ALL THE MEN OF HIS TIME WHOM I HAVE KNOWN HE WAS THE
WISEST AND JUSTEST AND BEST

GORGIAS
BY PLATO
TRANSLATED BY BENJAMIN JOWETT
INTRODUCTION
IN SEVERAL OF THE DIALOGUES OF PLATO DOUBTS HAVE ARISEN AMONG HIS
INTERPRETERS AS TO WHICH OF THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS DISCUSSED IN THEM
IS THE MAIN THESIS
THE SPEAKERS HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CONVERSATION NO
SEVERE RULES OF ART RESTRICT THEM AND SOMETIMES WE ARE INCLINED TO
THINK WITH ONE OF THE DRAMATIS PERSONAE IN THE THEAETETUS THAT THE
DIGRESSIONS HAVE THE GREATER INTEREST
YET IN THE MOST IRREGULAR OF THE
DIALOGUES THERE IS ALSO A CERTAIN NATURAL GROWTH OR UNITY THE BEGINNING
IS NOT FORGOTTEN AT THE END AND NUMEROUS ALLUSIONS AND REFERENCES ARE
INTERSPERSED WHICH FORM THE LOOSE CONNECTING LINKS OF THE WHOLE
WE
MUST NOT NEGLECT THIS UNITY BUT NEITHER MUST WE ATTEMPT TO CONFINE
THE PLATONIC DIALOGUE ON THE PROCRUSTEAN BED OF A SINGLE IDEA
COMPARE
INTRODUCTION TO THE PHAEDRUS
TWO TENDENCIES SEEM TO HAVE BESET THE INTERPRETERS OF PLATO IN THIS
MATTER
FIRST THEY HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO HANG THE DIALOGUES UPON ONE
ANOTHER BY THE SLIGHTEST THREADS AND HAVE THUS BEEN LED TO OPPOSITE AND
CONTRADICTORY ASSERTIONS RESPECTING THEIR ORDER AND SEQUENCE
THE MANTLE
OF SCHLEIERMACHER HAS DESCENDED UPON HIS SUCCESSORS WHO HAVE APPLIED
HIS METHOD WITH THE MOST VARIOUS RESULTS
THE VALUE AND USE OF THE
METHOD HAS BEEN HARDLY IF AT ALL EXAMINED EITHER BY HIM OR THEM
SECONDLY THEY HAVE EXTENDED ALMOST INDEFINITELY THE SCOPE OF EACH
SEPARATE DIALOGUE IN THIS WAY THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE ESCAPED ALL
DIFFICULTIES NOT SEEING THAT WHAT THEY HAVE GAINED IN GENERALITY THEY
HAVE LOST IN TRUTH AND DISTINCTNESS
METAPHYSICAL CONCEPTIONS EASILY
PASS INTO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SIMPLER NOTIONS OF ANTIQUITY WHICH
WE CAN ONLY REALIZE BY AN EFFORT IMPERCEPTIBLY BLEND WITH THE MORE
FAMILIAR THEORIES OF MODERN PHILOSOPHERS
AN EYE FOR PROPORTION IS
NEEDED HIS OWN ART OF MEASURING IN THE STUDY OF PLATO AS WELL AS OF
OTHER GREAT ARTISTS
WE MAY HARDLY ADMIT THAT THE MORAL ANTITHESIS
OF GOOD AND PLEASURE OR THE INTELLECTUAL ANTITHESIS OF KNOWLEDGE
AND OPINION BEING AND APPEARANCE ARE NEVER FAR OFF IN A PLATONIC
DISCUSSION
BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE BACKGROUND WE SHOULD NOT BRING
THEM INTO THE FOREGROUND OR EXPECT TO DISCERN THEM EQUALLY IN ALL THE
DIALOGUES
THERE MAY BE SOME ADVANTAGE IN DRAWING OUT A LITTLE THE MAIN OUTLINES
OF THE BUILDING BUT THE USE OF THIS IS LIMITED AND MAY BE EASILY
EXAGGERATED
WE MAY GIVE PLATO TOO MUCH SYSTEM AND ALTER THE NATURAL
FORM AND CONNECTION OF HIS THOUGHTS
UNDER THE IDEA THAT HIS DIALOGUES
ARE FINISHED WORKS OF ART WE MAY FIND A REASON FOR EVERYTHING AND LOSE
THE HIGHEST CHARACTERISTIC OF ART WHICH IS SIMPLICITY
MOST GREAT WORKS
RECEIVE A NEW LIGHT FROM A NEW AND ORIGINAL MIND
BUT WHETHER THESE NEW
LIGHTS ARE TRUE OR ONLY SUGGESTIVE WILL DEPEND ON THEIR AGREEMENT WITH
THE SPIRIT OF PLATO AND THE AMOUNT OF DIRECT EVIDENCE WHICH CAN
BE URGED IN SUPPORT OF THEM
WHEN A THEORY IS RUNNING AWAY WITH
US CRITICISM DOES A FRIENDLY OFFICE IN COUNSELLING MODERATION AND
RECALLING US TO THE INDICATIONS OF THE TEXT
LIKE THE PHAEDRUS THE GORGIAS HAS PUZZLED STUDENTS OF PLATO BY THE
APPEARANCE OF TWO OR MORE SUBJECTS
UNDER THE COVER OF RHETORIC HIGHER
THEMES ARE INTRODUCED THE ARGUMENT EXPANDS INTO A GENERAL VIEW OF THE
GOOD AND EVIL OF MAN
AFTER MAKING AN INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN A
SOUND DEFINITION OF HIS ART FROM GORGIAS SOCRATES ASSUMES THE
EXISTENCE OF A UNIVERSAL ART OF FLATTERY OR SIMULATION HAVING SEVERAL
BRANCHES THIS IS THE GENUS OF WHICH RHETORIC IS ONLY ONE AND NOT THE
HIGHEST SPECIES
TO FLATTERY IS OPPOSED THE TRUE AND NOBLE ART OF LIFE
WHICH HE WHO POSSESSES SEEKS ALWAYS TO IMPART TO OTHERS AND WHICH AT
LAST TRIUMPHS IF NOT HERE AT ANY RATE IN ANOTHER WORLD
THESE TWO
ASPECTS OF LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE APPEAR TO BE THE TWO LEADING IDEAS OF
THE DIALOGUE
THE TRUE AND THE FALSE IN INDIVIDUALS AND STATES IN THE
TREATMENT OF THE SOUL AS WELL AS OF THE BODY ARE CONCEIVED UNDER THE
FORMS OF TRUE AND FALSE ART
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS OPPOSITION
THERE ARISE VARIOUS OTHER QUESTIONS SUCH AS THE TWO FAMOUS PARADOXES OF
SOCRATES PARADOXES AS THEY ARE TO THE WORLD IN GENERAL IDEALS AS THEY
MAY BE MORE WORTHILY CALLED 1 THAT TO DO IS WORSE THAN TO SUFFER
EVIL AND 2 THAT WHEN A MAN HAS DONE EVIL HE HAD BETTER BE PUNISHED
THAN UNPUNISHED TO WHICH MAY BE ADDED 3 A THIRD SOCRATIC PARADOX OR
IDEAL THAT BAD MEN DO WHAT THEY THINK BEST BUT NOT WHAT THEY DESIRE
FOR THE DESIRE OF ALL IS TOWARDS THE GOOD
THAT PLEASURE IS TO BE
DISTINGUISHED FROM GOOD IS PROVED BY THE SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF PLEASURE
AND PAIN AND BY THE POSSIBILITY OF THE BAD HAVING IN CERTAIN CASES
PLEASURES AS GREAT AS THOSE OF THE GOOD OR EVEN GREATER
NOT MERELY
RHETORICIANS BUT POETS MUSICIANS AND OTHER ARTISTS THE WHOLE TRIBE
OF STATESMEN PAST AS WELL AS PRESENT ARE INCLUDED IN THE CLASS OF
FLATTERERS
THE TRUE AND FALSE FINALLY APPEAR BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT
OF THE GODS BELOW
THE DIALOGUE NATURALLY FALLS INTO THREE DIVISIONS TO WHICH THE THREE
CHARACTERS OF GORGIAS POLUS AND CALLICLES RESPECTIVELY CORRESPOND AND
THE FORM AND MANNER CHANGE WITH THE STAGES OF THE ARGUMENT
SOCRATES IS
DEFERENTIAL TOWARDS GORGIAS PLAYFUL AND YET CUTTING IN DEALING WITH THE
YOUTHFUL POLUS IRONICAL AND SARCASTIC IN HIS ENCOUNTER WITH CALLICLES
IN THE FIRST DIVISION THE QUESTION IS ASKED WHAT IS RHETORIC TO THIS
THERE IS NO ANSWER GIVEN FOR GORGIAS IS SOON MADE TO CONTRADICT
HIMSELF BY SOCRATES AND THE ARGUMENT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HANDS OF HIS
DISCIPLE POLUS WHO RUSHES TO THE DEFENCE OF HIS MASTER
THE ANSWER HAS
AT LAST TO BE GIVEN BY SOCRATES HIMSELF BUT BEFORE HE CAN EVEN EXPLAIN
HIS MEANING TO POLUS HE MUST ENLIGHTEN HIM UPON THE GREAT SUBJECT OF
SHAMS OR FLATTERIES
WHEN POLUS FINDS HIS FAVOURITE ART REDUCED TO
THE LEVEL OF COOKERY HE REPLIES THAT AT ANY RATE RHETORICIANS LIKE
DESPOTS HAVE GREAT POWER
SOCRATES DENIES THAT THEY HAVE ANY REAL
POWER AND HENCE ARISE THE THREE PARADOXES ALREADY MENTIONED
ALTHOUGH
THEY ARE STRANGE TO HIM POLUS IS AT LAST CONVINCED OF THEIR TRUTH AT
LEAST THEY SEEM TO HIM TO FOLLOW LEGITIMATELY FROM THE PREMISES
THUS
THE SECOND ACT OF THE DIALOGUE CLOSES
THEN CALLICLES APPEARS ON THE
SCENE AT FIRST MAINTAINING THAT PLEASURE IS GOOD AND THAT MIGHT IS
RIGHT AND THAT LAW IS NOTHING BUT THE COMBINATION OF THE MANY WEAK
AGAINST THE FEW STRONG
WHEN HE IS CONFUTED HE WITHDRAWS FROM THE
ARGUMENT AND LEAVES SOCRATES TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION BY HIMSELF
THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF STATESMANSHIP A HIGHER
AND A LOWER THAT WHICH MAKES THE PEOPLE BETTER AND THAT WHICH ONLY
FLATTERS THEM AND HE EXHORTS CALLICLES TO CHOOSE THE HIGHER
THE
DIALOGUE TERMINATES WITH A MYTHUS OF A FINAL JUDGMENT IN WHICH THERE
WILL BE NO MORE FLATTERY OR DISGUISE AND NO FURTHER USE FOR THE
TEACHING OF RHETORIC
THE CHARACTERS OF THE THREE INTERLOCUTORS ALSO CORRESPOND TO THE PARTS
WHICH ARE ASSIGNED TO THEM
GORGIAS IS THE GREAT RHETORICIAN NOW
ADVANCED IN YEARS WHO GOES FROM CITY TO CITY DISPLAYING HIS TALENTS
AND IS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT GREECE
LIKE ALL THE SOPHISTS IN THE
DIALOGUES OF PLATO HE IS VAIN AND BOASTFUL YET HE HAS ALSO A CERTAIN
DIGNITY AND IS TREATED BY SOCRATES WITH CONSIDERABLE RESPECT
BUT HE IS
NO MATCH FOR HIM IN DIALECTICS
ALTHOUGH HE HAS BEEN TEACHING RHETORIC
ALL HIS LIFE HE IS STILL INCAPABLE OF DEFINING HIS OWN ART
WHEN HIS
IDEAS BEGIN TO CLEAR UP HE IS UNWILLING TO ADMIT THAT RHETORIC CAN
BE WHOLLY SEPARATED FROM JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE AND THIS LINGERING
SENTIMENT OF MORALITY OR REGARD FOR PUBLIC OPINION ENABLES SOCRATES TO
DETECT HIM IN A CONTRADICTION
LIKE PROTAGORAS HE IS DESCRIBED AS OF
A GENEROUS NATURE HE EXPRESSES HIS APPROBATION OF SOCRATES' MANNER OF
APPROACHING A QUESTION HE IS QUITE 'ONE OF SOCRATES' SORT READY TO
BE REFUTED AS WELL AS TO REFUTE AND VERY EAGER THAT CALLICLES AND
SOCRATES SHOULD HAVE THE GAME OUT
HE KNOWS BY EXPERIENCE THAT RHETORIC
EXERCISES GREAT INFLUENCE OVER OTHER MEN BUT HE IS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
THE PUZZLE HOW RHETORIC CAN TEACH EVERYTHING AND KNOW NOTHING
POLUS IS AN IMPETUOUS YOUTH A RUNAWAY 'COLT AS SOCRATES DESCRIBES
HIM WHO WANTED ORIGINALLY TO HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF GORGIAS UNDER
THE PRETEXT THAT THE OLD MAN WAS TIRED AND NOW AVAILS HIMSELF OF THE
EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER THE LISTS
HE IS SAID TO BE THE AUTHOR
OF A WORK ON RHETORIC AND IS AGAIN MENTIONED IN THE PHAEDRUS AS THE
INVENTOR OF BALANCED OR DOUBLE FORMS OF SPEECH COMPARE GORG SYMP
AT FIRST HE IS VIOLENT AND ILL MANNERED AND IS ANGRY AT SEEING HIS
MASTER OVERTHROWN
BUT IN THE JUDICIOUS HANDS OF SOCRATES HE IS SOON
RESTORED TO GOOD HUMOUR AND COMPELLED TO ASSENT TO THE REQUIRED
CONCLUSION
LIKE GORGIAS HE IS OVERTHROWN BECAUSE HE COMPROMISES HE IS
UNWILLING TO SAY THAT TO DO IS FAIRER OR MORE HONOURABLE THAN TO SUFFER
INJUSTICE
THOUGH HE IS FASCINATED BY THE POWER OF RHETORIC AND DAZZLED
BY THE SPLENDOUR OF SUCCESS HE IS NOT INSENSIBLE TO HIGHER ARGUMENTS
PLATO MAY HAVE FELT THAT THERE WOULD BE AN INCONGRUITY IN A YOUTH
MAINTAINING THE CAUSE OF INJUSTICE AGAINST THE WORLD
HE HAS NEVER HEARD
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUESTION AND HE LISTENS TO THE PARADOXES AS
THEY APPEAR TO HIM OF SOCRATES WITH EVIDENT ASTONISHMENT
HE CAN HARDLY
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ARCHELAUS BEING MISERABLE OR OF RHETORIC
BEING ONLY USEFUL IN SELF ACCUSATION
WHEN THE ARGUMENT WITH HIM HAS
FAIRLY RUN OUT
CALLICLES IN WHOSE HOUSE THEY ARE ASSEMBLED IS INTRODUCED ON THE
STAGE HE IS WITH DIFFICULTY CONVINCED THAT SOCRATES IS IN EARNEST
FOR IF THESE THINGS ARE TRUE THEN AS HE SAYS WITH REAL EMOTION THE
FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIETY ARE UPSIDE DOWN
IN HIM ANOTHER TYPE OF CHARACTER
IS REPRESENTED HE IS NEITHER SOPHIST NOR PHILOSOPHER BUT MAN OF THE
WORLD AND AN ACCOMPLISHED ATHENIAN GENTLEMAN
HE MIGHT BE DESCRIBED IN
MODERN LANGUAGE AS A CYNIC OR MATERIALIST A LOVER OF POWER AND ALSO OF
PLEASURE AND UNSCRUPULOUS IN HIS MEANS OF ATTAINING BOTH
THERE IS NO
DESIRE ON HIS PART TO OFFER ANY COMPROMISE IN THE INTERESTS OF MORALITY
NOR IS ANY CONCESSION MADE BY HIM
LIKE THRASYMACHUS IN THE REPUBLIC
THOUGH HE IS NOT OF THE SAME WEAK AND VULGAR CLASS HE CONSISTENTLY
MAINTAINS THAT MIGHT IS RIGHT
HIS GREAT MOTIVE OF ACTION IS POLITICAL
AMBITION IN THIS HE IS CHARACTERISTICALLY GREEK
LIKE ANYTUS IN THE
MENO HE IS THE ENEMY OF THE SOPHISTS BUT FAVOURS THE NEW ART OF
RHETORIC WHICH HE REGARDS AS AN EXCELLENT WEAPON OF ATTACK AND DEFENCE
HE IS A DESPISER OF MANKIND AS HE IS OF PHILOSOPHY AND SEES IN THE LAWS
OF THE STATE ONLY A VIOLATION OF THE ORDER OF NATURE WHICH INTENDED
THAT THE STRONGER SHOULD GOVERN THE WEAKER COMPARE REPUBLIC
LIKE
OTHER MEN OF THE WORLD WHO ARE OF A SPECULATIVE TURN OF MIND HE
GENERALIZES THE BAD SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE AND HAS EASILY BROUGHT DOWN
HIS PRINCIPLES TO HIS PRACTICE
PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY ALIKE SUPPLY HIM
WITH DISTINCTIONS SUITED TO HIS VIEW OF HUMAN LIFE
HE HAS A GOOD WILL
TO SOCRATES WHOSE TALENTS HE EVIDENTLY ADMIRES WHILE HE CENSURES THE
PUERILE USE WHICH HE MAKES OF THEM
HE EXPRESSES A KEEN INTELLECTUAL
INTEREST IN THE ARGUMENT
LIKE ANYTUS AGAIN HE HAS A SYMPATHY WITH
OTHER MEN OF THE WORLD THE ATHENIAN STATESMEN OF A FORMER GENERATION
WHO SHOWED NO WEAKNESS AND MADE NO MISTAKES SUCH AS MILTIADES
THEMISTOCLES PERICLES ARE HIS FAVOURITES
HIS IDEAL OF HUMAN CHARACTER
IS A MAN OF GREAT PASSIONS AND GREAT POWERS WHICH HE HAS DEVELOPED TO
THE UTMOST AND WHICH HE USES IN HIS OWN ENJOYMENT AND IN THE GOVERNMENT
OF OTHERS
HAD CRITIAS BEEN THE NAME INSTEAD OF CALLICLES ABOUT WHOM
WE KNOW NOTHING FROM OTHER SOURCES THE OPINIONS OF THE MAN WOULD HAVE
SEEMED TO REFLECT THE HISTORY OF HIS LIFE
AND NOW THE COMBAT DEEPENS
IN CALLICLES FAR MORE THAN IN ANY SOPHIST
OR RHETORICIAN IS CONCENTRATED THE SPIRIT OF EVIL AGAINST WHICH
SOCRATES IS CONTENDING THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD THE SPIRIT OF THE
MANY CONTENDING AGAINST THE ONE WISE MAN OF WHICH THE SOPHISTS AS
HE DESCRIBES THEM IN THE REPUBLIC ARE THE IMITATORS RATHER THAN THE
AUTHORS BEING THEMSELVES CARRIED AWAY BY THE GREAT TIDE OF PUBLIC
OPINION
SOCRATES APPROACHES HIS ANTAGONIST WARILY FROM A DISTANCE WITH
A SORT OF IRONY WHICH TOUCHES WITH A LIGHT HAND BOTH HIS PERSONAL VICES
PROBABLY IN ALLUSION TO SOME SCANDAL OF THE DAY AND HIS SERVILITY
TO THE POPULACE
AT THE SAME TIME HE IS IN MOST PROFOUND EARNEST AS
CHAEREPHON REMARKS
CALLICLES SOON LOSES HIS TEMPER BUT THE MORE HE IS
IRRITATED THE MORE PROVOKING AND MATTER OF FACT DOES SOCRATES BECOME
A REPARTEE OF HIS WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN REALLY MADE TO THE
'OMNISCIENT' HIPPIAS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF XENOPHON MEM IS
INTRODUCED
HE IS CALLED BY CALLICLES A POPULAR DECLAIMER AND CERTAINLY
SHOWS THAT HE HAS THE POWER IN THE WORDS OF GORGIAS OF BEING 'AS LONG
AS HE PLEASES OR 'AS SHORT AS HE PLEASES' COMPARE PROTAG
CALLICLES
EXHIBITS GREAT ABILITY IN DEFENDING HIMSELF AND ATTACKING SOCRATES WHOM
HE ACCUSES OF TRIFLING AND WORD SPLITTING HE IS SCANDALIZED THAT THE
LEGITIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN ARGUMENT SHOULD BE STATED IN PLAIN
TERMS AFTER THE MANNER OF MEN OF THE WORLD HE WISHES TO PRESERVE THE
DECENCIES OF LIFE
BUT HE CANNOT CONSISTENTLY MAINTAIN THE BAD SENSE
OF WORDS AND GETTING CONFUSED BETWEEN THE ABSTRACT NOTIONS OF BETTER
SUPERIOR STRONGER HE IS EASILY TURNED ROUND BY SOCRATES AND ONLY
INDUCED TO CONTINUE THE ARGUMENT BY THE AUTHORITY OF GORGIAS
ONCE WHEN
SOCRATES IS DESCRIBING THE MANNER IN WHICH THE AMBITIOUS CITIZEN HAS TO
IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH THE PEOPLE HE PARTIALLY RECOGNIZES THE TRUTH OF
HIS WORDS
THE SOCRATES OF THE GORGIAS MAY BE COMPARED WITH THE SOCRATES OF THE
PROTAGORAS AND MENO
AS IN OTHER DIALOGUES HE IS THE ENEMY OF THE
SOPHISTS AND RHETORICIANS AND ALSO OF THE STATESMEN WHOM HE REGARDS AS
ANOTHER VARIETY OF THE SAME SPECIES
HIS BEHAVIOUR IS GOVERNED BY THAT
OF HIS OPPONENTS THE LEAST FORWARDNESS OR EGOTISM ON THEIR PART IS MET
BY A CORRESPONDING IRONY ON THE PART OF SOCRATES
HE MUST SPEAK FOR
PHILOSOPHY WILL NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE SILENT
HE IS INDEED MORE IRONICAL
AND PROVOKING THAN IN ANY OTHER OF PLATO'S WRITINGS FOR HE IS 'FOOLED
TO THE TOP OF HIS BENT' BY THE WORLDLINESS OF CALLICLES
BUT HE IS ALSO
MORE DEEPLY IN EARNEST
HE RISES HIGHER THAN EVEN IN THE PHAEDO AND
CRITO AT FIRST ENVELOPING HIS MORAL CONVICTIONS IN A CLOUD OF DUST AND
DIALECTICS HE ENDS BY LOSING HIS METHOD HIS LIFE HIMSELF IN THEM
AS IN THE PROTAGORAS AND PHAEDRUS THROWING ASIDE THE VEIL OF IRONY HE
MAKES A SPEECH BUT TRUE TO HIS CHARACTER NOT UNTIL HIS ADVERSARY HAS
REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS
THE PRESENTIMENT OF HIS OWN FATE
IS HANGING OVER HIM
HE IS AWARE THAT SOCRATES THE SINGLE REAL TEACHER
OF POLITICS AS HE VENTURES TO CALL HIMSELF CANNOT SAFELY GO TO
WAR WITH THE WHOLE WORLD AND THAT IN THE COURTS OF EARTH HE WILL
BE CONDEMNED
BUT HE WILL BE JUSTIFIED IN THE WORLD BELOW
THEN THE
POSITION OF SOCRATES AND CALLICLES WILL BE REVERSED ALL THOSE THINGS
'UNFIT FOR EARS POLITE' WHICH CALLICLES HAS PROPHESIED AS LIKELY TO
HAPPEN TO HIM IN THIS LIFE THE INSULTING LANGUAGE THE BOX ON THE
EARS WILL RECOIL UPON HIS ASSAILANT
COMPARE REPUBLIC AND THE SIMILAR
REVERSAL OF THE POSITION OF THE LAWYER AND THE PHILOSOPHER IN THE
THEAETETUS
THERE IS AN INTERESTING ALLUSION TO HIS OWN BEHAVIOUR AT THE TRIAL
OF THE GENERALS AFTER THE BATTLE OF ARGINUSAE WHICH HE IRONICALLY
ATTRIBUTES TO HIS IGNORANCE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH A VOTE OF THE
ASSEMBLY SHOULD BE TAKEN
THIS IS SAID TO HAVE HAPPENED 'LAST YEAR'
B C
406 AND THEREFORE THE ASSUMED DATE OF THE DIALOGUE HAS BEEN
FIXED AT 405 B C WHEN SOCRATES WOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN AN OLD MAN
THE DATE IS CLEARLY MARKED BUT IS SCARCELY RECONCILABLE WITH ANOTHER
INDICATION OF TIME VIZ
THE 'RECENT' USURPATION OF ARCHELAUS WHICH
OCCURRED IN THE YEAR 413 AND STILL LESS WITH THE 'RECENT' DEATH OF
PERICLES WHO REALLY DIED TWENTY FOUR YEARS PREVIOUSLY 429 B C AND
IS AFTERWARDS RECKONED AMONG THE STATESMEN OF A PAST AGE OR WITH THE
MENTION OF NICIAS WHO DIED IN 413 AND IS NEVERTHELESS SPOKEN OF AS
A LIVING WITNESS
BUT WE SHALL HEREAFTER HAVE REASON TO OBSERVE THAT
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A GENERAL CONSISTENCY OF TIMES AND PERSONS IN THE
DIALOGUES OF PLATO A PRECISE DRAMATIC DATE IS AN INVENTION OF HIS
COMMENTATORS PREFACE TO REPUBLIC
THE CONCLUSION OF THE DIALOGUE IS REMARKABLE 1 FOR THE TRULY
CHARACTERISTIC DECLARATION OF SOCRATES THAT HE IS IGNORANT OF THE TRUE
NATURE AND BEARING OF THESE THINGS WHILE HE AFFIRMS AT THE SAME TIME
THAT NO ONE CAN MAINTAIN ANY OTHER VIEW WITHOUT BEING RIDICULOUS
THE
PROFESSION OF IGNORANCE REMINDS US OF THE EARLIER AND MORE EXCLUSIVELY
SOCRATIC DIALOGUES
BUT NEITHER IN THEM NOR IN THE APOLOGY NOR IN
THE MEMORABILIA OF XENOPHON DOES SOCRATES EXPRESS ANY DOUBT OF THE
FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS OF MORALITY
HE EVIDENTLY REGARDS THIS 'AMONG THE
MULTITUDE OF QUESTIONS' WHICH AGITATE HUMAN LIFE 'AS THE PRINCIPLE WHICH
ALONE REMAINS UNSHAKEN HE DOES NOT INSIST HERE ANY MORE THAN IN THE
PHAEDO ON THE LITERAL TRUTH OF THE MYTH BUT ONLY ON THE SOUNDNESS OF
THE DOCTRINE WHICH IS CONTAINED IN IT THAT DOING WRONG IS WORSE THAN
SUFFERING AND THAT A MAN SHOULD BE RATHER THAN SEEM FOR THE NEXT BEST
THING TO A MAN'S BEING JUST IS THAT HE SHOULD BE CORRECTED AND BECOME
JUST ALSO THAT HE SHOULD AVOID ALL FLATTERY WHETHER OF HIMSELF OR OF
OTHERS AND THAT RHETORIC SHOULD BE EMPLOYED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE
RIGHT ONLY
THE REVELATION OF ANOTHER LIFE IS A RECAPITULATION OF THE
ARGUMENT IN A FIGURE
2 SOCRATES MAKES THE SINGULAR REMARK THAT HE IS HIMSELF THE ONLY TRUE
POLITICIAN OF HIS AGE
IN OTHER PASSAGES ESPECIALLY IN THE APOLOGY HE
DISCLAIMS BEING A POLITICIAN AT ALL
THERE HE IS CONVINCED THAT HE OR
ANY OTHER GOOD MAN WHO ATTEMPTED TO RESIST THE POPULAR WILL WOULD BE
PUT TO DEATH BEFORE HE HAD DONE ANY GOOD TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS
HERE HE
ANTICIPATES SUCH A FATE FOR HIMSELF FROM THE FACT THAT HE IS 'THE ONLY
MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY WHO PERFORMS HIS PUBLIC DUTIES AT ALL THE TWO
POINTS OF VIEW ARE NOT REALLY INCONSISTENT BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THEM IS WORTH NOTICING SOCRATES IS AND IS NOT A PUBLIC MAN
NOT IN THE
ORDINARY SENSE LIKE ALCIBIADES OR PERICLES BUT IN A HIGHER ONE AND
THIS WILL SOONER OR LATER ENTAIL THE SAME CONSEQUENCES ON HIM
HE
CANNOT BE A PRIVATE MAN IF HE WOULD NEITHER CAN HE SEPARATE MORALS FROM
POLITICS
NOR IS HE UNWILLING TO BE A POLITICIAN ALTHOUGH HE FORESEES
THE DANGERS WHICH AWAIT HIM BUT HE MUST FIRST BECOME A BETTER AND
WISER MAN FOR HE AS WELL AS CALLICLES IS IN A STATE OF PERPLEXITY AND
UNCERTAINTY
AND YET THERE IS AN INCONSISTENCY FOR SHOULD NOT SOCRATES
TOO HAVE TAUGHT THE CITIZENS BETTER THAN TO PUT HIM TO DEATH
AND NOW AS HE HIMSELF SAYS WE WILL 'RESUME THE ARGUMENT FROM THE
BEGINNING
SOCRATES WHO IS ATTENDED BY HIS INSEPARABLE DISCIPLE CHAEREPHON MEETS
CALLICLES IN THE STREETS OF ATHENS
HE IS INFORMED THAT HE HAS JUST
MISSED AN EXHIBITION OF GORGIAS WHICH HE REGRETS BECAUSE HE
WAS DESIROUS NOT OF HEARING GORGIAS DISPLAY HIS RHETORIC BUT OF
INTERROGATING HIM CONCERNING THE NATURE OF HIS ART
CALLICLES PROPOSES
THAT THEY SHALL GO WITH HIM TO HIS OWN HOUSE WHERE GORGIAS IS STAYING
THERE THEY FIND THE GREAT RHETORICIAN AND HIS YOUNGER FRIEND AND
DISCIPLE POLUS
SOCRATES PUT THE QUESTION TO HIM CHAEREPHON
CHAEREPHON WHAT QUESTION
SOCRATES WHO IS HE SUCH A QUESTION AS WOULD ELICIT FROM A MAN THE
ANSWER 'I AM A COBBLER
POLUS SUGGESTS THAT GORGIAS MAY BE TIRED AND DESIRES TO ANSWER FOR HIM
'WHO IS GORGIAS ASKS CHAEREPHON IMITATING THE MANNER OF HIS MASTER
SOCRATES
'ONE OF THE BEST OF MEN AND A PROFICIENT IN THE BEST AND
NOBLEST OF EXPERIMENTAL ARTS ETC REPLIES POLUS IN RHETORICAL
AND BALANCED PHRASES
SOCRATES IS DISSATISFIED AT THE LENGTH AND
UNMEANINGNESS OF THE ANSWER HE TELLS THE DISCONCERTED VOLUNTEER THAT
HE HAS MISTAKEN THE QUALITY FOR THE NATURE OF THE ART AND REMARKS TO
GORGIAS THAT POLUS HAS LEARNT HOW TO MAKE A SPEECH BUT NOT HOW TO
ANSWER A QUESTION
HE WISHES THAT GORGIAS WOULD ANSWER HIM
GORGIAS IS
WILLING ENOUGH AND REPLIES TO THE QUESTION ASKED BY CHAEREPHON THAT
HE IS A RHETORICIAN AND IN HOMERIC LANGUAGE 'BOASTS HIMSELF TO BE A
GOOD ONE AT THE REQUEST OF SOCRATES HE PROMISES TO BE BRIEF FOR 'HE
CAN BE AS LONG AS HE PLEASES AND AS SHORT AS HE PLEASES SOCRATES
WOULD HAVE HIM BESTOW HIS LENGTH ON OTHERS AND PROCEEDS TO ASK HIM
A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WHICH ARE ANSWERED BY HIM TO HIS OWN GREAT
SATISFACTION AND WITH A BREVITY WHICH EXCITES THE ADMIRATION OF
SOCRATES
THE RESULT OF THE DISCUSSION MAY BE SUMMED UP AS FOLLOWS
RHETORIC TREATS OF DISCOURSE BUT MUSIC AND MEDICINE AND OTHER
PARTICULAR ARTS ARE ALSO CONCERNED WITH DISCOURSE IN WHAT WAY THEN
DOES RHETORIC DIFFER FROM THEM GORGIAS DRAWS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE
ARTS WHICH DEAL WITH WORDS AND THE ARTS WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH EXTERNAL
ACTIONS
SOCRATES EXTENDS THIS DISTINCTION FURTHER AND DIVIDES ALL
PRODUCTIVE ARTS INTO TWO CLASSES 1 ARTS WHICH MAY BE CARRIED ON IN
SILENCE AND 2 ARTS WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH WORDS OR IN WHICH WORDS
ARE COEXTENSIVE WITH ACTION SUCH AS ARITHMETIC GEOMETRY RHETORIC
BUT STILL GORGIAS COULD HARDLY HAVE MEANT TO SAY THAT ARITHMETIC WAS THE
SAME AS RHETORIC
EVEN IN THE ARTS WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH WORDS THERE
ARE DIFFERENCES
WHAT THEN DISTINGUISHES RHETORIC FROM THE OTHER ARTS
WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH WORDS 'THE WORDS WHICH RHETORIC USES RELATE TO
THE BEST AND GREATEST OF HUMAN THINGS BUT TELL ME GORGIAS WHAT ARE
THE BEST 'HEALTH FIRST BEAUTY NEXT WEALTH THIRD IN THE WORDS OF
THE OLD SONG OR HOW WOULD YOU RANK THEM THE ARTS WILL COME TO YOU IN A
BODY EACH CLAIMING PRECEDENCE AND SAYING THAT HER OWN GOOD IS SUPERIOR
TO THAT OF THE REST HOW WILL YOU CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM 'I SHOULD SAY
SOCRATES THAT THE ART OF PERSUASION WHICH GIVES FREEDOM TO ALL MEN
AND TO INDIVIDUALS POWER IN THE STATE IS THE GREATEST GOOD BUT WHAT
IS THE EXACT NATURE OF THIS PERSUASION IS THE PERSEVERING RETORT YOU
COULD NOT DESCRIBE ZEUXIS AS A PAINTER OR EVEN AS A PAINTER OF FIGURES
IF THERE WERE OTHER PAINTERS OF FIGURES NEITHER CAN YOU DEFINE RHETORIC
SIMPLY AS AN ART OF PERSUASION BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER ARTS WHICH
PERSUADE SUCH AS ARITHMETIC WHICH IS AN ART OF PERSUASION ABOUT ODD
AND EVEN NUMBERS
GORGIAS IS MADE TO SEE THE NECESSITY OF A FURTHER
LIMITATION AND HE NOW DEFINES RHETORIC AS THE ART OF PERSUADING IN THE
LAW COURTS AND IN THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT THE JUST AND UNJUST
BUT STILL
THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF PERSUASION ONE WHICH GIVES KNOWLEDGE AND
ANOTHER WHICH GIVES BELIEF WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS
TRUE BUT BELIEF MAY BE EITHER TRUE OR FALSE THERE IS THEREFORE A
FURTHER QUESTION WHICH OF THE TWO SORTS OF PERSUASION DOES RHETORIC
EFFECT IN COURTS OF LAW AND ASSEMBLIES PLAINLY THAT WHICH GIVES
BELIEF AND NOT THAT WHICH GIVES KNOWLEDGE FOR NO ONE CAN IMPART A REAL
KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH MATTERS TO A CROWD OF PERSONS IN A FEW MINUTES
AND
THERE IS ANOTHER POINT TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE ASSEMBLY MEETS TO
ADVISE ABOUT WALLS OR DOCKS OR MILITARY EXPEDITIONS THE RHETORICIAN
IS NOT TAKEN INTO COUNSEL BUT THE ARCHITECT OR THE GENERAL
HOW WOULD
GORGIAS EXPLAIN THIS PHENOMENON ALL WHO INTEND TO BECOME DISCIPLES
OF WHOM THERE ARE SEVERAL IN THE COMPANY AND NOT SOCRATES ONLY ARE
EAGERLY ASKING ABOUT WHAT THEN WILL RHETORIC TEACH US TO PERSUADE OR
ADVISE THE STATE
GORGIAS ILLUSTRATES THE NATURE OF RHETORIC BY ADDUCING THE EXAMPLE
OF THEMISTOCLES WHO PERSUADED THE ATHENIANS TO BUILD THEIR DOCKS AND
WALLS AND OF PERICLES WHOM SOCRATES HIMSELF HAS HEARD SPEAKING ABOUT
THE MIDDLE WALL OF THE PIRAEUS
HE ADDS THAT HE HAS EXERCISED A SIMILAR
POWER OVER THE PATIENTS OF HIS BROTHER HERODICUS
HE COULD BE CHOSEN A
PHYSICIAN BY THE ASSEMBLY IF HE PLEASED FOR NO PHYSICIAN COULD COMPETE
WITH A RHETORICIAN IN POPULARITY AND INFLUENCE
HE COULD PERSUADE
THE MULTITUDE OF ANYTHING BY THE POWER OF HIS RHETORIC NOT THAT THE
RHETORICIAN OUGHT TO ABUSE THIS POWER ANY MORE THAN A BOXER SHOULD ABUSE
THE ART OF SELF DEFENCE
RHETORIC IS A GOOD THING BUT LIKE ALL GOOD
THINGS MAY BE UNLAWFULLY USED
NEITHER IS THE TEACHER OF THE ART TO BE
DEEMED UNJUST BECAUSE HIS PUPILS ARE UNJUST AND MAKE A BAD USE OF THE
LESSONS WHICH THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM HIM
SOCRATES WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BEFORE HE REPLIES WHETHER GORGIAS WILL
QUARREL WITH HIM IF HE POINTS OUT A SLIGHT INCONSISTENCY INTO WHICH HE
HAS FALLEN OR WHETHER HE LIKE HIMSELF IS ONE WHO LOVES TO BE REFUTED
GORGIAS DECLARES THAT HE IS QUITE ONE OF HIS SORT BUT FEARS THAT
THE ARGUMENT MAY BE TEDIOUS TO THE COMPANY
THE COMPANY CHEER AND
CHAEREPHON AND CALLICLES EXHORT THEM TO PROCEED
SOCRATES GENTLY POINTS
OUT THE SUPPOSED INCONSISTENCY INTO WHICH GORGIAS APPEARS TO
HAVE FALLEN AND WHICH HE IS INCLINED TO THINK MAY ARISE OUT OF A
MISAPPREHENSION OF HIS OWN
THE RHETORICIAN HAS BEEN DECLARED BY GORGIAS
TO BE MORE PERSUASIVE TO THE IGNORANT THAN THE PHYSICIAN OR ANY OTHER
EXPERT
AND HE IS SAID TO BE IGNORANT AND THIS IGNORANCE OF HIS IS
REGARDED BY GORGIAS AS A HAPPY CONDITION FOR HE HAS ESCAPED THE TROUBLE
OF LEARNING
BUT IS HE AS IGNORANT OF JUST AND UNJUST AS HE IS OF
MEDICINE OR BUILDING GORGIAS IS COMPELLED TO ADMIT THAT IF HE DID NOT
KNOW THEM PREVIOUSLY HE MUST LEARN THEM FROM HIS TEACHER AS A PART OF
THE ART OF RHETORIC
BUT HE WHO HAS LEARNED CARPENTRY IS A CARPENTER
AND HE WHO HAS LEARNED MUSIC IS A MUSICIAN AND HE WHO HAS LEARNED
JUSTICE IS JUST
THE RHETORICIAN THEN MUST BE A JUST MAN AND RHETORIC
IS A JUST THING
BUT GORGIAS HAS ALREADY ADMITTED THE OPPOSITE OF THIS
VIZ
THAT RHETORIC MAY BE ABUSED AND THAT THE RHETORICIAN MAY ACT
UNJUSTLY
HOW IS THE INCONSISTENCY TO BE EXPLAINED
THE FALLACY OF THIS ARGUMENT IS TWOFOLD FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE A MAN
MAY KNOW JUSTICE AND NOT BE JUST HERE IS THE OLD CONFUSION OF THE ARTS
AND THE VIRTUES NOR CAN ANY TEACHER BE EXPECTED TO COUNTERACT WHOLLY
THE BENT OF NATURAL CHARACTER AND SECONDLY A MAN MAY HAVE A DEGREE OF
JUSTICE BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT HIM FROM EVER DOING WRONG
POLUS
IS NATURALLY EXASPERATED AT THE SOPHISM WHICH HE IS UNABLE TO DETECT
OF COURSE HE SAYS THE RHETORICIAN LIKE EVERY ONE ELSE WILL ADMIT
THAT HE KNOWS JUSTICE HOW CAN HE DO OTHERWISE WHEN PRESSED BY THE
INTERROGATIONS OF SOCRATES BUT HE THINKS THAT GREAT WANT OF MANNERS
IS SHOWN IN BRINGING THE ARGUMENT TO SUCH A PASS
SOCRATES IRONICALLY
REPLIES THAT WHEN OLD MEN TRIP THE YOUNG SET THEM ON THEIR LEGS AGAIN
AND HE IS QUITE WILLING TO RETRACT IF HE CAN BE SHOWN TO BE IN ERROR
BUT UPON ONE CONDITION WHICH IS THAT POLUS STUDIES BREVITY
POLUS IS
IN GREAT INDIGNATION AT NOT BEING ALLOWED TO USE AS MANY WORDS AS HE
PLEASES IN THE FREE STATE OF ATHENS
SOCRATES RETORTS THAT YET HARDER
WILL BE HIS OWN CASE IF HE IS COMPELLED TO STAY AND LISTEN TO THEM
AFTER SOME ALTERCATION THEY AGREE COMPARE PROTAG THAT POLUS SHALL
ASK AND SOCRATES ANSWER
'WHAT IS THE ART OF RHETORIC SAYS POLUS
NOT AN ART AT ALL REPLIES
SOCRATES BUT A THING WHICH IN YOUR BOOK YOU AFFIRM TO HAVE CREATED ART
POLUS ASKS 'WHAT THING AND SOCRATES ANSWERS AN EXPERIENCE OR ROUTINE
OF MAKING A SORT OF DELIGHT OR GRATIFICATION
'BUT IS NOT RHETORIC A
FINE THING I HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU WHAT RHETORIC IS
WILL YOU ASK ME
ANOTHER QUESTION WHAT IS COOKERY 'WHAT IS COOKERY AN EXPERIENCE OR
ROUTINE OF MAKING A SORT OF DELIGHT OR GRATIFICATION
THEN THEY ARE THE
SAME OR RATHER FALL UNDER THE SAME CLASS AND RHETORIC HAS STILL TO BE
DISTINGUISHED FROM COOKERY
'WHAT IS RHETORIC ASKS POLUS ONCE MORE
A PART OF A NOT VERY CREDITABLE WHOLE WHICH MAY BE TERMED FLATTERY
IS THE REPLY
'BUT WHAT PART A SHADOW OF A PART OF POLITICS
THIS AS
MIGHT BE EXPECTED IS WHOLLY UNINTELLIGIBLE BOTH TO GORGIAS AND
POLUS AND IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN HIS MEANING TO THEM SOCRATES DRAWS A
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SHADOWS OR APPEARANCES AND REALITIES E G
THERE IS
REAL HEALTH OF BODY OR SOUL AND THE APPEARANCE OF THEM REAL ARTS AND
SCIENCES AND THE SIMULATIONS OF THEM
NOW THE SOUL AND BODY HAVE TWO
ARTS WAITING UPON THEM FIRST THE ART OF POLITICS WHICH ATTENDS ON THE
SOUL HAVING A LEGISLATIVE PART AND A JUDICIAL PART AND ANOTHER ART
ATTENDING ON THE BODY WHICH HAS NO GENERIC NAME BUT MAY ALSO BE
DESCRIBED AS HAVING TWO DIVISIONS ONE OF WHICH IS MEDICINE AND THE
OTHER GYMNASTIC
CORRESPONDING WITH THESE FOUR ARTS OR SCIENCES THERE
ARE FOUR SHAMS OR SIMULATIONS OF THEM MERE EXPERIENCES AS THEY MAY BE
TERMED BECAUSE THEY GIVE NO REASON OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE
THE ART OF
DRESSING UP IS THE SHAM OR SIMULATION OF GYMNASTIC THE ART OF COOKERY
OF MEDICINE RHETORIC IS THE SIMULATION OF JUSTICE AND SOPHISTIC OF
LEGISLATION
THEY MAY BE SUMMED UP IN AN ARITHMETICAL FORMULA
TIRING GYMNASTIC COOKERY MEDICINE SOPHISTIC LEGISLATION
AND
COOKERY MEDICINE RHETORIC THE ART OF JUSTICE
AND THIS IS THE TRUE SCHEME OF THEM BUT WHEN MEASURED ONLY BY THE
GRATIFICATION WHICH THEY PROCURE THEY BECOME JUMBLED TOGETHER AND
RETURN TO THEIR ABORIGINAL CHAOS
SOCRATES APOLOGIZES FOR THE LENGTH OF
HIS SPEECH WHICH WAS NECESSARY TO THE EXPLANATION OF THE SUBJECT AND
BEGS POLUS NOT UNNECESSARILY TO RETALIATE ON HIM
'DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THE RHETORICIANS ARE ESTEEMED FLATTERERS THEY
ARE NOT ESTEEMED AT ALL
'WHY HAVE THEY NOT GREAT POWER AND CAN THEY
NOT DO WHATEVER THEY DESIRE THEY HAVE NO POWER AND THEY ONLY DO WHAT
THEY THINK BEST AND NEVER WHAT THEY DESIRE FOR THEY NEVER ATTAIN THE
TRUE OBJECT OF DESIRE WHICH IS THE GOOD
'AS IF YOU SOCRATES WOULD
NOT ENVY THE POSSESSOR OF DESPOTIC POWER WHO CAN IMPRISON EXILE KILL
ANY ONE WHOM HE PLEASES BUT SOCRATES REPLIES THAT HE HAS NO WISH TO
PUT ANY ONE TO DEATH HE WHO KILLS ANOTHER EVEN JUSTLY IS NOT TO BE
ENVIED AND HE WHO KILLS HIM UNJUSTLY IS TO BE PITIED IT IS BETTER TO
SUFFER THAN TO DO INJUSTICE
HE DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT GOING ABOUT WITH
A DAGGER AND PUTTING MEN OUT OF THE WAY OR SETTING A HOUSE ON FIRE IS
REAL POWER
TO THIS POLUS ASSENTS ON THE GROUND THAT SUCH ACTS WOULD
BE PUNISHED BUT HE IS STILL OF OPINION THAT EVIL DOERS IF THEY
ARE UNPUNISHED MAY BE HAPPY ENOUGH
HE INSTANCES ARCHELAUS SON
OF PERDICCAS THE USURPER OF MACEDONIA
DOES NOT SOCRATES THINK HIM
HAPPY SOCRATES WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM HE CANNOT PRONOUNCE
EVEN THE GREAT KING TO BE HAPPY UNLESS HE KNOWS HIS MENTAL AND MORAL
CONDITION
POLUS EXPLAINS THAT ARCHELAUS WAS A SLAVE BEING THE SON OF
A WOMAN WHO WAS THE SLAVE OF ALCETAS BROTHER OF PERDICCAS KING OF
MACEDON AND HE BY EVERY SPECIES OF CRIME FIRST MURDERING HIS UNCLE
AND THEN HIS COUSIN AND HALF BROTHER OBTAINED THE KINGDOM
THIS WAS
VERY WICKED AND YET ALL THE WORLD INCLUDING SOCRATES WOULD LIKE TO
HAVE HIS PLACE
SOCRATES DISMISSES THE APPEAL TO NUMBERS POLUS IF HE
WILL MAY SUMMON ALL THE RICH MEN OF ATHENS NICIAS AND HIS BROTHERS
ARISTOCRATES THE HOUSE OF PERICLES OR ANY OTHER GREAT FAMILY THIS IS
THE KIND OF EVIDENCE WHICH IS ADDUCED IN COURTS OF JUSTICE WHERE TRUTH
DEPENDS UPON NUMBERS
BUT SOCRATES EMPLOYS PROOF OF ANOTHER SORT HIS
APPEAL IS TO ONE WITNESS ONLY THAT IS TO SAY THE PERSON WITH WHOM
HE IS SPEAKING HIM HE WILL CONVICT OUT OF HIS OWN MOUTH
AND HE IS
PREPARED TO SHOW AFTER HIS MANNER THAT ARCHELAUS CANNOT BE A WICKED
MAN AND YET HAPPY
THE EVIL DOER IS DEEMED HAPPY IF HE ESCAPES AND MISERABLE IF HE SUFFERS
PUNISHMENT BUT SOCRATES THINKS HIM LESS MISERABLE IF HE SUFFERS THAN
IF HE ESCAPES
POLUS IS OF OPINION THAT SUCH A PARADOX AS THIS HARDLY
DESERVES REFUTATION AND IS AT ANY RATE SUFFICIENTLY REFUTED BY THE
FACT
SOCRATES HAS ONLY TO COMPARE THE LOT OF THE SUCCESSFUL TYRANT WHO
IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD AND OF THE WRETCH WHO HAVING BEEN DETECTED
IN A CRIMINAL ATTEMPT AGAINST THE STATE IS CRUCIFIED OR BURNT TO
DEATH
SOCRATES REPLIES THAT IF THEY ARE BOTH CRIMINAL THEY ARE BOTH
MISERABLE BUT THAT THE UNPUNISHED IS THE MORE MISERABLE OF THE TWO
AT
THIS POLUS LAUGHS OUTRIGHT WHICH LEADS SOCRATES TO REMARK THAT LAUGHTER
IS A NEW SPECIES OF REFUTATION
POLUS REPLIES THAT HE IS ALREADY
REFUTED FOR IF HE WILL TAKE THE VOTES OF THE COMPANY HE WILL FIND
THAT NO ONE AGREES WITH HIM
TO THIS SOCRATES REJOINS THAT HE IS NOT
A PUBLIC MAN AND REFERRING TO HIS OWN CONDUCT AT THE TRIAL OF THE
GENERALS AFTER THE BATTLE OF ARGINUSAE IS UNABLE TO TAKE THE SUFFRAGES
OF ANY COMPANY AS HE HAD SHOWN ON A RECENT OCCASION HE CAN ONLY DEAL
WITH ONE WITNESS AT A TIME AND THAT IS THE PERSON WITH WHOM HE IS
ARGUING
BUT HE IS CERTAIN THAT IN THE OPINION OF ANY MAN TO DO IS WORSE
THAN TO SUFFER EVIL
POLUS THOUGH HE WILL NOT ADMIT THIS IS READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TO DO
EVIL IS CONSIDERED THE MORE FOUL OR DISHONOURABLE OF THE TWO
BUT WHAT
IS FAIR AND WHAT IS FOUL WHETHER THE TERMS ARE APPLIED TO BODIES
COLOURS FIGURES LAWS HABITS STUDIES MUST THEY NOT BE DEFINED
WITH REFERENCE TO PLEASURE AND UTILITY POLUS ASSENTS TO THIS LATTER
DOCTRINE AND IS EASILY PERSUADED THAT THE FOULER OF TWO THINGS MUST
EXCEED EITHER IN PAIN OR IN HURT
BUT THE DOING CANNOT EXCEED THE
SUFFERING OF EVIL IN PAIN AND THEREFORE MUST EXCEED IN HURT
THUS DOING
IS PROVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF POLUS HIMSELF TO BE WORSE OR MORE HURTFUL
THAN SUFFERING
THERE REMAINS THE OTHER QUESTION IS A GUILTY MAN BETTER OFF WHEN HE IS
PUNISHED OR WHEN HE IS UNPUNISHED SOCRATES REPLIES THAT WHAT IS DONE
JUSTLY IS SUFFERED JUSTLY IF THE ACT IS JUST THE EFFECT IS JUST IF
TO PUNISH IS JUST TO BE PUNISHED IS JUST AND THEREFORE FAIR AND
THEREFORE BENEFICENT AND THE BENEFIT IS THAT THE SOUL IS IMPROVED
THERE ARE THREE EVILS FROM WHICH A MAN MAY SUFFER AND WHICH AFFECT HIM
IN ESTATE BODY AND SOUL THESE ARE POVERTY DISEASE INJUSTICE AND
THE FOULEST OF THESE IS INJUSTICE THE EVIL OF THE SOUL BECAUSE THAT
BRINGS THE GREATEST HURT
AND THERE ARE THREE ARTS WHICH HEAL THESE
EVILS TRADING MEDICINE JUSTICE AND THE FAIREST OF THESE IS JUSTICE
HAPPY IS HE WHO HAS NEVER COMMITTED INJUSTICE AND HAPPY IN THE SECOND
DEGREE HE WHO HAS BEEN HEALED BY PUNISHMENT
AND THEREFORE THE CRIMINAL
SHOULD HIMSELF GO TO THE JUDGE AS HE WOULD TO THE PHYSICIAN AND PURGE
AWAY HIS CRIME
RHETORIC WILL ENABLE HIM TO DISPLAY HIS GUILT IN PROPER
COLOURS AND TO SUSTAIN HIMSELF AND OTHERS IN ENDURING THE NECESSARY
PENALTY
AND SIMILARLY IF A MAN HAS AN ENEMY HE WILL DESIRE NOT TO
PUNISH HIM BUT THAT HE SHALL GO UNPUNISHED AND BECOME WORSE AND WORSE
TAKING CARE ONLY THAT HE DOES NO INJURY TO HIMSELF
THESE ARE AT LEAST
CONCEIVABLE USES OF THE ART AND NO OTHERS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY US
HERE CALLICLES WHO HAS BEEN LISTENING IN SILENT AMAZEMENT ASKS
CHAEREPHON WHETHER SOCRATES IS IN EARNEST AND ON RECEIVING THE
ASSURANCE THAT HE IS PROCEEDS TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION OF SOCRATES
HIMSELF
FOR IF SUCH DOCTRINES ARE TRUE LIFE MUST HAVE BEEN TURNED
UPSIDE DOWN AND ALL OF US ARE DOING THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE
DOING
SOCRATES REPLIES IN A STYLE OF PLAYFUL IRONY THAT BEFORE MEN CAN
UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER THEY MUST HAVE SOME COMMON FEELING
AND SUCH A
COMMUNITY OF FEELING EXISTS BETWEEN HIMSELF AND CALLICLES FOR BOTH
OF THEM ARE LOVERS AND THEY HAVE BOTH A PAIR OF LOVES THE BELOVED OF
CALLICLES ARE THE ATHENIAN DEMOS AND DEMOS THE SON OF PYRILAMPES THE
BELOVED OF SOCRATES ARE ALCIBIADES AND PHILOSOPHY
THE PECULIARITY OF
CALLICLES IS THAT HE CAN NEVER CONTRADICT HIS LOVES HE CHANGES AS HIS
DEMOS CHANGES IN ALL HIS OPINIONS HE WATCHES THE COUNTENANCE OF BOTH
HIS LOVES AND REPEATS THEIR SENTIMENTS AND IF ANY ONE IS SURPRISED
AT HIS SAYINGS AND DOINGS THE EXPLANATION OF THEM IS THAT HE IS NOT A
FREE AGENT BUT MUST ALWAYS BE IMITATING HIS TWO LOVES
AND THIS IS THE
EXPLANATION OF SOCRATES' PECULIARITIES ALSO
HE IS ALWAYS REPEATING WHAT
HIS MISTRESS PHILOSOPHY IS SAYING TO HIM WHO UNLIKE HIS OTHER LOVE
ALCIBIADES IS EVER THE SAME EVER TRUE
CALLICLES MUST REFUTE HER OR
HE WILL NEVER BE AT UNITY WITH HIMSELF AND DISCORD IN LIFE IS FAR WORSE
THAN THE DISCORD OF MUSICAL SOUNDS
CALLICLES ANSWERS THAT GORGIAS WAS OVERTHROWN BECAUSE AS POLUS SAID
IN COMPLIANCE WITH POPULAR PREJUDICE HE HAD ADMITTED THAT IF HIS PUPIL
DID NOT KNOW JUSTICE THE RHETORICIAN MUST TEACH HIM AND POLUS HAS BEEN
SIMILARLY ENTANGLED BECAUSE HIS MODESTY LED HIM TO ADMIT THAT TO SUFFER
IS MORE HONOURABLE THAN TO DO INJUSTICE
BY CUSTOM 'YES BUT NOT BY
NATURE SAYS CALLICLES
AND SOCRATES IS ALWAYS PLAYING BETWEEN THE TWO
POINTS OF VIEW AND PUTTING ONE IN THE PLACE OF THE OTHER
IN THIS
VERY ARGUMENT WHAT POLUS ONLY MEANT IN A CONVENTIONAL SENSE HAS
BEEN AFFIRMED BY HIM TO BE A LAW OF NATURE
FOR CONVENTION SAYS THAT
'INJUSTICE IS DISHONOURABLE BUT NATURE SAYS THAT 'MIGHT IS RIGHT
AND WE ARE ALWAYS TAMING DOWN THE NOBLER SPIRITS AMONG US TO THE
CONVENTIONAL LEVEL
BUT SOMETIMES A GREAT MAN WILL RISE UP AND REASSERT
HIS ORIGINAL RIGHTS TRAMPLING UNDER FOOT ALL OUR FORMULARIES AND THEN
THE LIGHT OF NATURAL JUSTICE SHINES FORTH
PINDAR SAYS 'LAW THE
KING OF ALL DOES VIOLENCE WITH HIGH HAND AS IS INDEED PROVED BY THE
EXAMPLE OF HERACLES WHO DROVE OFF THE OXEN OF GERYON AND NEVER PAID FOR
THEM
THIS IS THE TRUTH SOCRATES AS YOU WILL BE CONVINCED IF YOU LEAVE
PHILOSOPHY AND PASS ON TO THE REAL BUSINESS OF LIFE
A LITTLE PHILOSOPHY
IS AN EXCELLENT THING TOO MUCH IS THE RUIN OF A MAN
HE WHO HAS NOT
'PASSED HIS METAPHYSICS' BEFORE HE HAS GROWN UP TO MANHOOD WILL NEVER
KNOW THE WORLD
PHILOSOPHERS ARE RIDICULOUS WHEN THEY TAKE TO POLITICS
AND I DARE SAY THAT POLITICIANS ARE EQUALLY RIDICULOUS WHEN THEY TAKE TO
PHILOSOPHY 'EVERY MAN AS EURIPIDES SAYS 'IS FONDEST OF THAT IN WHICH
HE IS BEST PHILOSOPHY IS GRACEFUL IN YOUTH LIKE THE LISP OF INFANCY
AND SHOULD BE CULTIVATED AS A PART OF EDUCATION BUT WHEN A GROWN UP MAN
LISPS OR STUDIES PHILOSOPHY I SHOULD LIKE TO BEAT HIM
NONE OF THOSE
OVER REFINED NATURES EVER COME TO ANY GOOD THEY AVOID THE BUSY HAUNTS
OF MEN AND SKULK IN CORNERS WHISPERING TO A FEW ADMIRING YOUTHS AND
NEVER GIVING UTTERANCE TO ANY NOBLE SENTIMENTS
FOR YOU SOCRATES I HAVE A REGARD AND THEREFORE I SAY TO YOU
AS ZETHUS SAYS TO AMPHION IN THE PLAY THAT YOU HAVE 'A NOBLE SOUL
DISGUISED IN A PUERILE EXTERIOR AND I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER THE
DANGER WHICH YOU AND OTHER PHILOSOPHERS INCUR
FOR YOU WOULD NOT KNOW
HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF IF ANY ONE ACCUSED YOU IN A LAW COURT THERE YOU
WOULD STAND WITH GAPING MOUTH AND DIZZY BRAIN AND MIGHT BE MURDERED
ROBBED BOXED ON THE EARS WITH IMPUNITY
TAKE MY ADVICE THEN AND GET A
LITTLE COMMON SENSE LEAVE TO OTHERS THESE FRIVOLITIES WALK IN THE WAYS
OF THE WEALTHY AND BE WISE
SOCRATES PROFESSES TO HAVE FOUND IN CALLICLES THE PHILOSOPHER'S
TOUCHSTONE AND HE IS CERTAIN THAT ANY OPINION IN WHICH THEY BOTH AGREE
MUST BE THE VERY TRUTH
CALLICLES HAS ALL THE THREE QUALITIES WHICH ARE
NEEDED IN A CRITIC KNOWLEDGE GOOD WILL FRANKNESS GORGIAS AND POLUS
ALTHOUGH LEARNED MEN WERE TOO MODEST AND THEIR MODESTY MADE THEM
CONTRADICT THEMSELVES
BUT CALLICLES IS WELL EDUCATED AND HE IS NOT
TOO MODEST TO SPEAK OUT OF THIS HE HAS ALREADY GIVEN PROOF AND HIS
GOOD WILL IS SHOWN BOTH BY HIS OWN PROFESSION AND BY HIS GIVING THE SAME
CAUTION AGAINST PHILOSOPHY TO SOCRATES WHICH SOCRATES REMEMBERS HEARING
HIM GIVE LONG AGO TO HIS OWN CLIQUE OF FRIENDS
HE WILL PLEDGE HIMSELF
TO RETRACT ANY ERROR INTO WHICH HE MAY HAVE FALLEN AND WHICH CALLICLES
MAY POINT OUT
BUT HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FIRST OF ALL WHAT HE AND PINDAR
MEAN BY NATURAL JUSTICE
DO THEY SUPPOSE THAT THE RULE OF JUSTICE IS THE
RULE OF THE STRONGER OR OF THE BETTER 'THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE THEN
ARE NOT THE MANY SUPERIOR TO THE ONE AND THE OPINIONS OF THE MANY
BETTER AND THEIR OPINION IS THAT JUSTICE IS EQUALITY AND THAT TO DO IS
MORE DISHONOURABLE THAN TO SUFFER WRONG
AND AS THEY ARE THE SUPERIOR OR
STRONGER THIS OPINION OF THEIRS MUST BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL AS
WELL AS CONVENTIONAL JUSTICE
'WHY WILL YOU CONTINUE SPLITTING WORDS
HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU THAT THE SUPERIOR IS THE BETTER BUT WHAT DO YOU
MEAN BY THE BETTER TELL ME THAT AND PLEASE TO BE A LITTLE MILDER
IN YOUR LANGUAGE IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO DRIVE ME AWAY
'I MEAN THE
WORTHIER THE WISER YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT ONE MAN OF SENSE OUGHT TO
RULE OVER TEN THOUSAND FOOLS 'YES THAT IS MY MEANING OUGHT THE
PHYSICIAN THEN TO HAVE A LARGER SHARE OF MEATS AND DRINKS OR THE WEAVER
TO HAVE MORE COATS OR THE COBBLER LARGER SHOES OR THE FARMER MORE
SEED 'YOU ARE ALWAYS SAYING THE SAME THINGS SOCRATES YES AND ON THE
SAME SUBJECTS TOO BUT YOU ARE NEVER SAYING THE SAME THINGS
FOR FIRST
YOU DEFINED THE SUPERIOR TO BE THE STRONGER AND THEN THE WISER AND NOW
SOMETHING ELSE WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'I MEAN MEN OF POLITICAL ABILITY WHO
OUGHT TO GOVERN AND TO HAVE MORE THAN THE GOVERNED THAN THEMSELVES
'WHAT DO YOU MEAN I MEAN TO SAY THAT EVERY MAN IS HIS OWN GOVERNOR
'I
SEE THAT YOU MEAN THOSE DOLTS THE TEMPERATE
BUT MY DOCTRINE IS THAT A
MAN SHOULD LET HIS DESIRES GROW AND TAKE THE MEANS OF SATISFYING THEM
TO THE MANY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE AND THEREFORE THEY COMBINE TO PREVENT
HIM
BUT IF HE IS A KING AND HAS POWER HOW BASE WOULD HE BE IN
SUBMITTING TO THEM TO INVITE THE COMMON HERD TO BE LORD OVER HIM WHEN
HE MIGHT HAVE THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL THINGS FOR THE TRUTH IS SOCRATES
THAT LUXURY AND SELF INDULGENCE ARE VIRTUE AND HAPPINESS ALL THE REST
IS MERE TALK
SOCRATES COMPLIMENTS CALLICLES ON HIS FRANKNESS IN SAYING WHAT OTHER MEN
ONLY THINK
ACCORDING TO HIS VIEW THOSE WHO WANT NOTHING ARE NOT HAPPY
'WHY SAYS CALLICLES 'IF THEY WERE STONES AND THE DEAD WOULD BE
HAPPY SOCRATES IN REPLY IS LED INTO A HALF SERIOUS HALF COMIC VEIN
OF REFLECTION
'WHO KNOWS AS EURIPIDES SAYS 'WHETHER LIFE MAY NOT BE
DEATH AND DEATH LIFE NAY THERE ARE PHILOSOPHERS WHO MAINTAIN THAT
EVEN IN LIFE WE ARE DEAD AND THAT THE BODY SOMA IS THE TOMB SEMA OF
THE SOUL
AND SOME INGENIOUS SICILIAN HAS MADE AN ALLEGORY IN WHICH
HE REPRESENTS FOOLS AS THE UNINITIATED WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CARRYING
WATER TO A VESSEL WHICH IS FULL OF HOLES IN A SIMILARLY HOLEY SIEVE
AND THIS SIEVE IS THEIR OWN SOUL
THE IDEA IS FANCIFUL BUT NEVERTHELESS
IS A FIGURE OF A TRUTH WHICH I WANT TO MAKE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE VIZ
THAT
THE LIFE OF CONTENTMENT IS BETTER THAN THE LIFE OF INDULGENCE
ARE YOU
DISPOSED TO ADMIT THAT 'FAR OTHERWISE THEN HEAR ANOTHER PARABLE
THE LIFE OF SELF CONTENTMENT AND SELF INDULGENCE MAY BE REPRESENTED
RESPECTIVELY BY TWO MEN WHO ARE FILLING JARS WITH STREAMS OF WINE
HONEY MILK THE JARS OF THE ONE ARE SOUND AND THE JARS OF THE OTHER
LEAKY THE FIRST FILS HIS JARS AND HAS NO MORE TROUBLE WITH THEM THE
SECOND IS ALWAYS FILLING THEM AND WOULD SUFFER EXTREME MISERY IF HE
DESISTED
ARE YOU OF THE SAME OPINION STILL 'YES SOCRATES AND THE
FIGURE EXPRESSES WHAT I MEAN
FOR TRUE PLEASURE IS A PERPETUAL STREAM
FLOWING IN AND FLOWING OUT
TO BE HUNGRY AND ALWAYS EATING TO BE
THIRSTY AND ALWAYS DRINKING AND TO HAVE ALL THE OTHER DESIRES AND TO
SATISFY THEM THAT AS I ADMIT IS MY IDEA OF HAPPINESS AND TO
BE ITCHING AND ALWAYS SCRATCHING 'I DO NOT DENY THAT THERE MAY BE
HAPPINESS EVEN IN THAT AND TO INDULGE UNNATURAL DESIRES IF THEY ARE
ABUNDANTLY SATISFIED CALLICLES IS INDIGNANT AT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH
TOPICS
BUT HE IS REMINDED BY SOCRATES THAT THEY ARE INTRODUCED NOT BY
HIM BUT BY THE MAINTAINER OF THE IDENTITY OF PLEASURE AND GOOD
WILL
CALLICLES STILL MAINTAIN THIS 'YES FOR THE SAKE OF CONSISTENCY HE
WILL THE ANSWER DOES NOT SATISFY SOCRATES WHO FEARS THAT HE IS LOSING
HIS TOUCHSTONE
A PROFESSION OF SERIOUSNESS ON THE PART OF CALLICLES
REASSURES HIM AND THEY PROCEED WITH THE ARGUMENT
PLEASURE AND GOOD
ARE THE SAME BUT KNOWLEDGE AND COURAGE ARE NOT THE SAME EITHER WITH
PLEASURE OR GOOD OR WITH ONE ANOTHER
SOCRATES DISPROVES THE FIRST OF
THESE STATEMENTS BY SHOWING THAT TWO OPPOSITES CANNOT COEXIST BUT MUST
ALTERNATE WITH ONE ANOTHER TO BE WELL AND ILL TOGETHER IS IMPOSSIBLE
BUT PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE SIMULTANEOUS AND THE CESSATION OF THEM IS
SIMULTANEOUS E G
IN THE CASE OF DRINKING AND THIRSTING WHEREAS GOOD
AND EVIL ARE NOT SIMULTANEOUS AND DO NOT CEASE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND
THEREFORE PLEASURE CANNOT BE THE SAME AS GOOD
CALLICLES HAS ALREADY LOST HIS TEMPER AND CAN ONLY BE PERSUADED TO GO
ON BY THE INTERPOSITION OF GORGIAS
SOCRATES HAVING ALREADY GUARDED
AGAINST OBJECTIONS BY DISTINGUISHING COURAGE AND KNOWLEDGE FROM PLEASURE
AND GOOD PROCEEDS THE GOOD ARE GOOD BY THE PRESENCE OF GOOD AND THE
BAD ARE BAD BY THE PRESENCE OF EVIL
AND THE BRAVE AND WISE ARE GOOD
AND THE COWARDLY AND FOOLISH ARE BAD
AND HE WHO FEELS PLEASURE IS GOOD
AND HE WHO FEELS PAIN IS BAD AND BOTH FEEL PLEASURE AND PAIN IN NEARLY
THE SAME DEGREE AND SOMETIMES THE BAD MAN OR COWARD IN A GREATER
DEGREE
THEREFORE THE BAD MAN OR COWARD IS AS GOOD AS THE BRAVE OR MAY
BE EVEN BETTER
CALLICLES ENDEAVOURS NOW TO AVERT THE INEVITABLE ABSURDITY BY AFFIRMING
THAT HE AND ALL MANKIND ADMITTED SOME PLEASURES TO BE GOOD AND OTHERS
BAD
THE GOOD ARE THE BENEFICIAL AND THE BAD ARE THE HURTFUL AND
WE SHOULD CHOOSE THE ONE AND AVOID THE OTHER
BUT THIS AS SOCRATES
OBSERVES IS A RETURN TO THE OLD DOCTRINE OF HIMSELF AND POLUS THAT ALL
THINGS SHOULD BE DONE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD
CALLICLES ASSENTS TO THIS AND SOCRATES FINDING THAT THEY ARE AGREED
IN DISTINGUISHING PLEASURE FROM GOOD RETURNS TO HIS OLD DIVISION OF
EMPIRICAL HABITS OR SHAMS OR FLATTERIES WHICH STUDY PLEASURE ONLY
AND THE ARTS WHICH ARE CONCERNED WITH THE HIGHER INTERESTS OF SOUL AND
BODY
DOES CALLICLES AGREE TO THIS DIVISION CALLICLES WILL AGREE TO
ANYTHING IN ORDER THAT HE MAY GET THROUGH THE ARGUMENT
WHICH OF
THE ARTS THEN ARE FLATTERIES FLUTE PLAYING HARP PLAYING CHORAL
EXHIBITIONS THE DITHYRAMBICS OF CINESIAS ARE ALL EQUALLY CONDEMNED ON
THE GROUND THAT THEY GIVE PLEASURE ONLY AND MELES THE HARP PLAYER WHO
WAS THE FATHER OF CINESIAS FAILED EVEN IN THAT
THE STATELY MUSE OF
TRAGEDY IS BENT UPON PLEASURE AND NOT UPON IMPROVEMENT
POETRY IN
GENERAL IS ONLY A RHETORICAL ADDRESS TO A MIXED AUDIENCE OF MEN WOMEN
AND CHILDREN
AND THE ORATORS ARE VERY FAR FROM SPEAKING WITH A VIEW
TO WHAT IS BEST THEIR WAY IS TO HUMOUR THE ASSEMBLY AS IF THEY WERE
CHILDREN
CALLICLES REPLIES THAT THIS IS ONLY TRUE OF SOME OF THEM OTHERS HAVE
A REAL REGARD FOR THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS
GRANTED THEN THERE ARE TWO
SPECIES OF ORATORY THE ONE A FLATTERY ANOTHER WHICH HAS A REAL REGARD
FOR THE CITIZENS
BUT WHERE ARE THE ORATORS AMONG WHOM YOU FIND THE
LATTER CALLICLES ADMITS THAT THERE ARE NONE REMAINING BUT THERE WERE
SUCH IN THE DAYS WHEN THEMISTOCLES CIMON MILTIADES AND THE GREAT
PERICLES WERE STILL ALIVE
SOCRATES REPLIES THAT NONE OF THESE WERE TRUE
ARTISTS SETTING BEFORE THEMSELVES THE DUTY OF BRINGING ORDER OUT OF
DISORDER
THE GOOD MAN AND TRUE ORATOR HAS A SETTLED DESIGN RUNNING
THROUGH HIS LIFE TO WHICH HE CONFORMS ALL HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS HE
DESIRES TO IMPLANT JUSTICE AND ERADICATE INJUSTICE TO IMPLANT ALL
VIRTUE AND ERADICATE ALL VICE IN THE MINDS OF HIS CITIZENS
HE IS THE
PHYSICIAN WHO WILL NOT ALLOW THE SICK MAN TO INDULGE HIS APPETITES
WITH A VARIETY OF MEATS AND DRINKS BUT INSISTS ON HIS EXERCISING
SELF RESTRAINT
AND THIS IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL AND BETTER THAN THE
UNRESTRAINED INDULGENCE WHICH CALLICLES WAS RECENTLY APPROVING
HERE CALLICLES WHO HAD BEEN WITH DIFFICULTY BROUGHT TO THIS POINT
TURNS RESTIVE AND SUGGESTS THAT SOCRATES SHALL ANSWER HIS OWN
QUESTIONS
'THEN SAYS SOCRATES 'ONE MAN MUST DO FOR TWO AND THOUGH
HE HAD HOPED TO HAVE GIVEN CALLICLES AN 'AMPHION' IN RETURN FOR HIS
'ZETHUS HE IS WILLING TO PROCEED AT THE SAME TIME HE HOPES THAT
CALLICLES WILL CORRECT HIM IF HE FALLS INTO ERROR
HE RECAPITULATES THE
ADVANTAGES WHICH HE HAS ALREADY WON
THE PLEASANT IS NOT THE SAME AS THE GOOD CALLICLES AND I ARE AGREED
ABOUT THAT BUT PLEASURE IS TO BE PURSUED FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD AND
THE GOOD IS THAT OF WHICH THE PRESENCE MAKES US GOOD WE AND ALL THINGS
GOOD HAVE ACQUIRED SOME VIRTUE OR OTHER
AND VIRTUE WHETHER OF BODY OR
SOUL OF THINGS OR PERSONS IS NOT ATTAINED BY ACCIDENT BUT IS DUE TO
ORDER AND HARMONIOUS ARRANGEMENT
AND THE SOUL WHICH HAS ORDER IS BETTER
THAN THE SOUL WHICH IS WITHOUT ORDER AND IS THEREFORE TEMPERATE AND IS
THEREFORE GOOD AND THE INTEMPERATE IS BAD
AND HE WHO IS TEMPERATE
IS ALSO JUST AND BRAVE AND PIOUS AND HAS ATTAINED THE PERFECTION
OF GOODNESS AND THEREFORE OF HAPPINESS AND THE INTEMPERATE WHOM YOU
APPROVE IS THE OPPOSITE OF ALL THIS AND IS WRETCHED
HE THEREFORE WHO
WOULD BE HAPPY MUST PURSUE TEMPERANCE AND AVOID INTEMPERANCE AND IF
POSSIBLE ESCAPE THE NECESSITY OF PUNISHMENT BUT IF HE HAVE DONE WRONG
HE MUST ENDURE PUNISHMENT
IN THIS WAY STATES AND INDIVIDUALS SHOULD
SEEK TO ATTAIN HARMONY WHICH AS THE WISE TELL US IS THE BOND OF
HEAVEN AND EARTH OF GODS AND MEN
CALLICLES HAS NEVER DISCOVERED THE
POWER OF GEOMETRICAL PROPORTION IN BOTH WORLDS HE WOULD HAVE MEN AIM
AT DISPROPORTION AND EXCESS
BUT IF HE BE WRONG IN THIS AND IF
SELF CONTROL IS THE TRUE SECRET OF HAPPINESS THEN THE PARADOX IS TRUE
THAT THE ONLY USE OF RHETORIC IS IN SELF ACCUSATION AND POLUS WAS RIGHT
IN SAYING THAT TO DO WRONG IS WORSE THAN TO SUFFER WRONG AND GORGIAS
WAS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT THE RHETORICIAN MUST BE A JUST MAN
AND YOU
WERE WRONG IN TAUNTING ME WITH MY DEFENCELESS CONDITION AND IN SAYING
THAT I MIGHT BE ACCUSED OR PUT TO DEATH OR BOXED ON THE EARS WITH
IMPUNITY
FOR I MAY REPEAT ONCE MORE THAT TO STRIKE IS WORSE THAN TO
BE STRICKEN TO DO THAN TO SUFFER
WHAT I SAID THEN IS NOW MADE FAST IN
ADAMANTINE BONDS
I MYSELF KNOW NOT THE TRUE NATURE OF THESE THINGS BUT
I KNOW THAT NO ONE CAN DENY MY WORDS AND NOT BE RIDICULOUS
TO DO WRONG
IS THE GREATEST OF EVILS AND TO SUFFER WRONG IS THE NEXT GREATEST EVIL
HE WHO WOULD AVOID THE LAST MUST BE A RULER OR THE FRIEND OF A RULER
AND TO BE THE FRIEND HE MUST BE THE EQUAL OF THE RULER AND MUST ALSO
RESEMBLE HIM
UNDER HIS PROTECTION HE WILL SUFFER NO EVIL BUT WILL HE
ALSO DO NO EVIL NAY WILL HE NOT RATHER DO ALL THE EVIL WHICH HE CAN
AND ESCAPE AND IN THIS WAY THE GREATEST OF ALL EVILS WILL BEFALL HIM
'BUT THIS IMITATOR OF THE TYRANT REJOINS CALLICLES 'WILL KILL ANY
ONE WHO DOES NOT SIMILARLY IMITATE HIM SOCRATES REPLIES THAT HE IS
NOT DEAF AND THAT HE HAS HEARD THAT REPEATED MANY TIMES AND CAN
ONLY REPLY THAT A BAD MAN WILL KILL A GOOD ONE
'YES AND THAT IS THE
PROVOKING THING NOT PROVOKING TO A MAN OF SENSE WHO IS NOT STUDYING
THE ARTS WHICH WILL PRESERVE HIM FROM DANGER AND THIS AS YOU SAY IS
THE USE OF RHETORIC IN COURTS OF JUSTICE
BUT HOW MANY OTHER ARTS ARE
THERE WHICH ALSO SAVE MEN FROM DEATH AND ARE YET QUITE HUMBLE IN THEIR
PRETENSIONS SUCH AS THE ART OF SWIMMING OR THE ART OF THE PILOT DOES
NOT THE PILOT DO MEN AT LEAST AS MUCH SERVICE AS THE RHETORICIAN AND
YET FOR THE VOYAGE FROM AEGINA TO ATHENS HE DOES NOT CHARGE MORE THAN
TWO OBOLS AND WHEN HE DISEMBARKS IS QUITE UNASSUMING IN HIS DEMEANOUR
THE REASON IS THAT HE IS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER HE HAS DONE HIS PASSENGERS
ANY GOOD IN SAVING THEM FROM DEATH IF ONE OF THEM IS DISEASED IN BODY
AND STILL MORE IF HE IS DISEASED IN MIND WHO CAN SAY THE ENGINEER TOO
WILL OFTEN SAVE WHOLE CITIES AND YET YOU DESPISE HIM AND WOULD NOT
ALLOW YOUR SON TO MARRY HIS DAUGHTER OR HIS SON TO MARRY YOURS
BUT
WHAT REASON IS THERE IN THIS FOR IF VIRTUE ONLY MEANS THE SAVING OF
LIFE WHETHER YOUR OWN OR ANOTHER'S YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DESPISE HIM OR
ANY PRACTISER OF SAVING ARTS
BUT IS NOT VIRTUE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM
SAVING AND BEING SAVED I WOULD HAVE YOU RATHER CONSIDER WHETHER YOU
OUGHT NOT TO DISREGARD LENGTH OF LIFE AND THINK ONLY HOW YOU CAN LIVE
BEST LEAVING ALL BESIDES TO THE WILL OF HEAVEN
FOR YOU MUST NOT EXPECT
TO HAVE INFLUENCE EITHER WITH THE ATHENIAN DEMOS OR WITH DEMOS THE SON
OF PYRILAMPES UNLESS YOU BECOME LIKE THEM
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THIS
'THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BUT I DO NOT ENTIRELY
BELIEVE YOU
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH DEMOS
BUT LET US HAVE A LITTLE
MORE CONVERSATION
YOU REMEMBER THE TWO PROCESSES ONE WHICH WAS
DIRECTED TO PLEASURE THE OTHER WHICH WAS DIRECTED TO MAKING MEN AS GOOD
AS POSSIBLE
AND THOSE WHO HAVE THE CARE OF THE CITY SHOULD MAKE THE
CITIZENS AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE
BUT WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE A PUBLIC BUILDING
IF HE HAD NEVER HAD A TEACHER OF THE ART OF BUILDING AND HAD NEVER
CONSTRUCTED A BUILDING BEFORE OR WHO WOULD UNDERTAKE THE DUTY OF
STATE PHYSICIAN IF HE HAD NEVER CURED EITHER HIMSELF OR ANY ONE ELSE
SHOULD WE NOT EXAMINE HIM BEFORE WE ENTRUSTED HIM WITH THE OFFICE AND
AS CALLICLES IS ABOUT TO ENTER PUBLIC LIFE SHOULD WE NOT EXAMINE HIM
WHOM HAS HE MADE BETTER FOR WE HAVE ALREADY ADMITTED THAT THIS IS THE
STATESMAN'S PROPER BUSINESS
AND WE MUST ASK THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT
PERICLES AND CIMON AND MILTIADES AND THEMISTOCLES
WHOM DID THEY MAKE
BETTER NAY DID NOT PERICLES MAKE THE CITIZENS WORSE FOR HE GAVE
THEM PAY AND AT FIRST HE WAS VERY POPULAR WITH THEM BUT AT LAST THEY
CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH
YET SURELY HE WOULD BE A BAD TAMER OF ANIMALS
WHO HAVING RECEIVED THEM GENTLE TAUGHT THEM TO KICK AND BUTT AND
MAN IS AN ANIMAL AND PERICLES WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF MAN ONLY MADE HIM
WILDER AND MORE SAVAGE AND UNJUST AND THEREFORE HE COULD NOT HAVE
BEEN A GOOD STATESMAN
THE SAME TALE MIGHT BE REPEATED ABOUT CIMON
THEMISTOCLES MILTIADES
BUT THE CHARIOTEER WHO KEEPS HIS SEAT AT
FIRST IS NOT THROWN OUT WHEN HE GAINS GREATER EXPERIENCE AND SKILL
THE
INFERENCE IS THAT THE STATESMAN OF A PAST AGE WERE NO BETTER THAN
THOSE OF OUR OWN
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN CLEVERER CONSTRUCTORS OF DOCKS AND
HARBOURS BUT THEY DID NOT IMPROVE THE CHARACTER OF THE CITIZENS
I HAVE
TOLD YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND I PURPOSELY USE THE SAME IMAGES THAT THE
SOUL LIKE THE BODY MAY BE TREATED IN TWO WAYS THERE IS THE MEANER AND
THE HIGHER ART
YOU SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAID AT THE TIME BUT
WHEN I ASK YOU WHO WERE THE REALLY GOOD STATESMEN YOU ANSWER AS IF I
ASKED YOU WHO WERE THE GOOD TRAINERS AND YOU ANSWERED THEARION THE
BAKER MITHOECUS THE AUTHOR OF THE SICILIAN COOKERY BOOK SARAMBUS
THE VINTNER
AND YOU WOULD BE AFFRONTED IF I TOLD YOU THAT THESE ARE A
PARCEL OF COOKS WHO MAKE MEN FAT ONLY TO MAKE THEM THIN
AND THOSE WHOM
THEY HAVE FATTENED APPLAUD THEM INSTEAD OF FINDING FAULT WITH THEM AND
LAY THE BLAME OF THEIR SUBSEQUENT DISORDERS ON THEIR PHYSICIANS
IN THIS
RESPECT CALLICLES YOU ARE LIKE THEM YOU APPLAUD THE STATESMEN OF
OLD WHO PANDERED TO THE VICES OF THE CITIZENS AND FILLED THE CITY WITH
DOCKS AND HARBOURS BUT NEGLECTED VIRTUE AND JUSTICE
AND WHEN THE
FIT OF ILLNESS COMES THE CITIZENS WHO IN LIKE MANNER APPLAUDED
THEMISTOCLES PERICLES AND OTHERS WILL LAY HOLD OF YOU AND MY FRIEND
ALCIBIADES AND YOU WILL SUFFER FOR THE MISDEEDS OF YOUR PREDECESSORS
THE OLD STORY IS ALWAYS BEING REPEATED 'AFTER ALL HIS SERVICES THE
UNGRATEFUL CITY BANISHED HIM OR CONDEMNED HIM TO DEATH AS IF THE
STATESMAN SHOULD NOT HAVE TAUGHT THE CITY BETTER HE SURELY CANNOT BLAME
THE STATE FOR HAVING UNJUSTLY USED HIM ANY MORE THAN THE SOPHIST
OR TEACHER CAN FIND FAULT WITH HIS PUPILS IF THEY CHEAT HIM
AND THE
SOPHIST AND ORATOR ARE IN THE SAME CASE ALTHOUGH YOU ADMIRE RHETORIC
AND DESPISE SOPHISTIC WHEREAS SOPHISTIC IS REALLY THE HIGHER OF THE
TWO
THE TEACHER OF THE ARTS TAKES MONEY BUT THE TEACHER OF VIRTUE OR
POLITICS TAKES NO MONEY BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY KIND OF SERVICE WHICH
MAKES THE DISCIPLE DESIROUS OF REQUITING HIS TEACHER
SOCRATES CONCLUDES BY FINALLY ASKING TO WHICH OF THE TWO MODES
OF SERVING THE STATE CALLICLES INVITES HIM 'TO THE INFERIOR AND
MINISTERIAL ONE IS THE INGENUOUS REPLY
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY OF
AVOIDING DEATH REPLIES SOCRATES AND HE HAS HEARD OFTEN ENOUGH AND
WOULD RATHER NOT HEAR AGAIN THAT THE BAD MAN WILL KILL THE GOOD
BUT
HE THINKS THAT SUCH A FATE IS VERY LIKELY RESERVED FOR HIM BECAUSE HE
REMARKS THAT HE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO TEACHES THE TRUE ART OF POLITICS
AND VERY PROBABLY AS IN THE CASE WHICH HE DESCRIBED TO POLUS HE MAY BE
THE PHYSICIAN WHO IS TRIED BY A JURY OF CHILDREN
HE CANNOT SAY THAT HE
HAS PROCURED THE CITIZENS ANY PLEASURE AND IF ANY ONE CHARGES HIM WITH
PERPLEXING THEM OR WITH REVILING THEIR ELDERS HE WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS ONLY BEEN ACTUATED BY A DESIRE FOR
THEIR GOOD
AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT HIS FATE MAY BE
'AND DO YOU THINK THAT A MAN WHO IS UNABLE TO HELP HIMSELF IS IN A GOOD
CONDITION YES CALLICLES IF HE HAVE THE TRUE SELF HELP WHICH IS
NEVER TO HAVE SAID OR DONE ANY WRONG TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS
IF I HAD NOT
THIS KIND OF SELF HELP I SHOULD BE ASHAMED BUT IF I DIE FOR WANT OF
YOUR FLATTERING RHETORIC I SHALL DIE IN PEACE
FOR DEATH IS NO EVIL
BUT TO GO TO THE WORLD BELOW LADEN WITH OFFENCES IS THE WORST OF EVILS
IN PROOF OF WHICH I WILL TELL YOU A TALE
UNDER THE RULE OF CRONOS MEN WERE JUDGED ON THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH AND
WHEN JUDGMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN UPON THEM THEY DEPARTED THE GOOD TO THE
ISLANDS OF THE BLEST THE BAD TO THE HOUSE OF VENGEANCE
BUT AS THEY
WERE STILL LIVING AND HAD THEIR CLOTHES ON AT THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE
BEING JUDGED THERE WAS FAVOURITISM AND ZEUS WHEN HE CAME TO THE
THRONE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER THE MODE OF PROCEDURE AND TRY THEM AFTER
DEATH HAVING FIRST SENT DOWN PROMETHEUS TO TAKE AWAY FROM THEM THE
FOREKNOWLEDGE OF DEATH
MINOS RHADAMANTHUS AND AEACUS WERE APPOINTED
TO BE THE JUDGES RHADAMANTHUS FOR ASIA AEACUS FOR EUROPE AND MINOS
WAS TO HOLD THE COURT OF APPEAL
NOW DEATH IS THE SEPARATION OF SOUL AND
BODY BUT AFTER DEATH SOUL AND BODY ALIKE RETAIN THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
THE FAT MAN THE DANDY THE BRANDED SLAVE ARE ALL DISTINGUISHABLE
SOME
PRINCE OR POTENTATE PERHAPS EVEN THE GREAT KING HIMSELF APPEARS BEFORE
RHADAMANTHUS AND HE INSTANTLY DETECTS HIM THOUGH HE KNOWS NOT WHO HE
IS HE SEES THE SCARS OF PERJURY AND INIQUITY AND SENDS HIM AWAY TO THE
HOUSE OF TORMENT
FOR THERE ARE TWO CLASSES OF SOULS WHO UNDERGO PUNISHMENT THE CURABLE
AND THE INCURABLE
THE CURABLE ARE THOSE WHO ARE BENEFITED BY THEIR
PUNISHMENT THE INCURABLE ARE SUCH AS ARCHELAUS WHO BENEFIT OTHERS BY
BECOMING A WARNING TO THEM
THE LATTER CLASS ARE GENERALLY KINGS AND
POTENTATES MEANER PERSONS HAPPILY FOR THEMSELVES HAVE NOT THE SAME
POWER OF DOING INJUSTICE
SISYPHUS AND TITYUS NOT THERSITES ARE
SUPPOSED BY HOMER TO BE UNDERGOING EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT
NOT THAT
THERE IS ANYTHING TO PREVENT A GREAT MAN FROM BEING A GOOD ONE AS IS
SHOWN BY THE FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF ARISTEIDES THE SON OF LYSIMACHUS
BUT TO
RHADAMANTHUS THE SOULS ARE ONLY KNOWN AS GOOD OR BAD THEY ARE STRIPPED
OF THEIR DIGNITIES AND PREFERMENTS HE DESPATCHES THE BAD TO TARTARUS
LABELLED EITHER AS CURABLE OR INCURABLE AND LOOKS WITH LOVE AND
ADMIRATION ON THE SOUL OF SOME JUST ONE WHOM HE SENDS TO THE ISLANDS OF
THE BLEST
SIMILAR IS THE PRACTICE OF AEACUS AND MINOS OVERLOOKS THEM
HOLDING A GOLDEN SCEPTRE AS ODYSSEUS IN HOMER SAW HIM
'WIELDING A SCEPTRE OF GOLD AND GIVING LAWS TO THE DEAD
MY WISH FOR MYSELF AND MY FELLOW MEN IS THAT WE MAY PRESENT OUR SOULS
UNDEFILED TO THE JUDGE IN THAT DAY MY DESIRE IN LIFE IS TO BE ABLE TO
MEET DEATH
AND I EXHORT YOU AND RETORT UPON YOU THE REPROACH WHICH YOU
CAST UPON ME THAT YOU WILL STAND BEFORE THE JUDGE GAPING AND WITH
DIZZY BRAIN AND ANY ONE MAY BOX YOU ON THE EAR AND DO YOU ALL MANNER
OF EVIL
PERHAPS YOU THINK THAT THIS IS AN OLD WIVES' FABLE
BUT YOU WHO ARE THE
THREE WISEST MEN IN HELLAS HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO SAY AND NO ONE WILL
EVER SHOW THAT TO DO IS BETTER THAN TO SUFFER EVIL
A MAN SHOULD STUDY
TO BE AND NOT MERELY TO SEEM
IF HE IS BAD HE SHOULD BECOME GOOD AND
AVOID ALL FLATTERY WHETHER OF THE MANY OR OF THE FEW
FOLLOW ME THEN AND IF YOU ARE LOOKED DOWN UPON THAT WILL DO YOU NO
HARM
AND WHEN WE HAVE PRACTISED VIRTUE WE WILL BETAKE OURSELVES TO
POLITICS BUT NOT UNTIL WE ARE DELIVERED FROM THE SHAMEFUL STATE OF
IGNORANCE AND UNCERTAINTY IN WHICH WE ARE AT PRESENT
LET US FOLLOW
IN THE WAY OF VIRTUE AND JUSTICE AND NOT IN THE WAY TO WHICH YOU
CALLICLES INVITE US FOR THAT WAY IS NOTHING WORTH
WE WILL NOW CONSIDER IN ORDER SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE
DIALOGUE
HAVING REGARD 1 TO THE AGE OF PLATO AND THE IRONICAL
CHARACTER OF HIS WRITINGS WE MAY COMPARE HIM WITH HIMSELF AND WITH
OTHER GREAT TEACHERS AND WE MAY NOTE IN PASSING THE OBJECTIONS OF HIS
CRITICS
AND THEN 2 CASTING ONE EYE UPON HIM WE MAY CAST ANOTHER UPON
OURSELVES AND ENDEAVOUR TO DRAW OUT THE GREAT LESSONS WHICH HE
TEACHES FOR ALL TIME STRIPPED OF THE ACCIDENTAL FORM IN WHICH THEY ARE
ENVELOPED
1 IN THE GORGIAS AS IN NEARLY ALL THE OTHER DIALOGUES OF PLATO
WE ARE MADE AWARE THAT FORMAL LOGIC HAS AS YET NO EXISTENCE
THE OLD
DIFFICULTY OF FRAMING A DEFINITION RECURS
THE ILLUSIVE ANALOGY OF THE
ARTS AND THE VIRTUES ALSO CONTINUES
THE AMBIGUITY OF SEVERAL WORDS
SUCH AS NATURE CUSTOM THE HONOURABLE THE GOOD IS NOT CLEARED UP
THE SOPHISTS ARE STILL FLOUNDERING ABOUT THE DISTINCTION OF THE REAL
AND SEEMING
FIGURES OF SPEECH ARE MADE THE BASIS OF ARGUMENTS
THE
POSSIBILITY OF CONCEIVING A UNIVERSAL ART OR SCIENCE WHICH ADMITS
OF APPLICATION TO A PARTICULAR SUBJECT MATTER IS A DIFFICULTY WHICH
REMAINS UNSOLVED AND HAS NOT ALTOGETHER CEASED TO HAUNT THE WORLD AT
THE PRESENT DAY COMPARE CHARMIDES
THE DEFECT OF CLEARNESS IS ALSO
APPARENT IN SOCRATES HIMSELF UNLESS WE SUPPOSE HIM TO BE PRACTISING ON
THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS OPPONENT OR RATHER PERHAPS TRYING AN EXPERIMENT
IN DIALECTICS
NOTHING CAN BE MORE FALLACIOUS THAN THE CONTRADICTION
WHICH HE PRETENDS TO HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE ANSWERS OF GORGIAS SEE
ABOVE
THE ADVANTAGES WHICH HE GAINS OVER POLUS ARE ALSO DUE TO A FALSE
ANTITHESIS OF PLEASURE AND GOOD AND TO AN ERRONEOUS ASSERTION THAT AN
AGENT AND A PATIENT MAY BE DESCRIBED BY SIMILAR PREDICATES A MISTAKE
WHICH ARISTOTLE PARTLY SHARES AND PARTLY CORRECTS IN THE NICOMACHEAN
ETHICS
TRACES OF A 'ROBUST SOPHISTRY' ARE LIKEWISE DISCERNIBLE IN HIS
ARGUMENT WITH CALLICLES
2 ALTHOUGH SOCRATES PROFESSES TO BE CONVINCED BY REASON ONLY YET THE
ARGUMENT IS OFTEN A SORT OF DIALECTICAL FICTION BY WHICH HE CONDUCTS
HIMSELF AND OTHERS TO HIS OWN IDEAL OF LIFE AND ACTION
AND WE MAY
SOMETIMES WISH THAT WE COULD HAVE SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO HIS ANTAGONISTS
OR POINTED OUT TO THEM THE ROCKS WHICH LAY CONCEALED UNDER THE AMBIGUOUS
TERMS GOOD PLEASURE AND THE LIKE
BUT IT WOULD BE AS USELESS TO
EXAMINE HIS ARGUMENTS BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF MODERN LOGIC AS TO
CRITICISE THIS IDEAL FROM A MERELY UTILITARIAN POINT OF VIEW
IF WE SAY
THAT THE IDEAL IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS UNATTAINABLE AND THAT MANKIND
WILL BY NO MEANS AGREE IN THINKING THAT THE CRIMINAL IS HAPPIER WHEN
PUNISHED THAN WHEN UNPUNISHED ANY MORE THAN THEY WOULD AGREE TO THE
STOICAL PARADOX THAT A MAN MAY BE HAPPY ON THE RACK PLATO HAS ALREADY
ADMITTED THAT THE WORLD IS AGAINST HIM
NEITHER DOES HE MEAN TO SAY
THAT ARCHELAUS IS TORMENTED BY THE STINGS OF CONSCIENCE OR THAT THE
SENSATIONS OF THE IMPALED CRIMINAL ARE MORE AGREEABLE THAN THOSE OF THE
TYRANT DROWNED IN LUXURIOUS ENJOYMENT
NEITHER IS HE SPEAKING AS IN THE
PROTAGORAS OF VIRTUE AS A CALCULATION OF PLEASURE AN OPINION WHICH
HE AFTERWARDS REPUDIATES IN THE PHAEDO
WHAT THEN IS HIS MEANING HIS
MEANING WE SHALL BE ABLE TO ILLUSTRATE BEST BY PARALLEL NOTIONS WHICH
WHETHER JUSTIFIABLE BY LOGIC OR NOT HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED AMONG MANKIND
WE MUST REMIND THE READER THAT SOCRATES HIMSELF IMPLIES THAT HE WILL BE
UNDERSTOOD OR APPRECIATED BY VERY FEW
HE IS SPEAKING NOT OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAPPINESS BUT OF THE IDEA OF
HAPPINESS
WHEN A MARTYR DIES IN A GOOD CAUSE WHEN A SOLDIER FALLS IN
BATTLE WE DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT DEATH OR WOUNDS ARE WITHOUT PAIN OR THAT
THEIR PHYSICAL SUFFERING IS ALWAYS COMPENSATED BY A MENTAL SATISFACTION
STILL WE REGARD THEM AS HAPPY AND WE WOULD A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE
THEIR DEATH THAN A SHAMEFUL LIFE
NOR IS THIS ONLY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
THAT THEY WILL OBTAIN AN IMMORTALITY OF FAME OR THAT THEY WILL HAVE
CROWNS OF GLORY IN ANOTHER WORLD WHEN THEIR ENEMIES AND PERSECUTORS
WILL BE PROPORTIONABLY TORMENTED
MEN ARE FOUND IN A FEW INSTANCES TO DO
WHAT IS RIGHT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO PUBLIC OPINION OR TO CONSEQUENCES
AND WE REGARD THEM AS HAPPY ON THIS GROUND ONLY MUCH AS SOCRATES'
FRIENDS IN THE OPENING OF THE PHAEDO ARE DESCRIBED AS REGARDING HIM OR
AS WAS SAID OF ANOTHER 'THEY LOOKED UPON HIS FACE AS UPON THE FACE OF
AN ANGEL WE ARE NOT CONCERNED TO JUSTIFY THIS IDEALISM BY THE STANDARD
OF UTILITY OR PUBLIC OPINION BUT MERELY TO POINT OUT THE EXISTENCE OF
SUCH A SENTIMENT IN THE BETTER PART OF HUMAN NATURE
THE IDEALISM OF PLATO IS FOUNDED UPON THIS SENTIMENT
HE WOULD MAINTAIN
THAT IN SOME SENSE OR OTHER TRUTH AND RIGHT ARE ALONE TO BE SOUGHT AND
THAT ALL OTHER GOODS ARE ONLY DESIRABLE AS MEANS TOWARDS THESE
HE IS
THOUGHT TO HAVE ERRED IN 'CONSIDERING THE AGENT ONLY AND MAKING NO
REFERENCE TO THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS AS AFFECTED BY HIM BUT THE
HAPPINESS OF OTHERS OR OF MANKIND IF REGARDED AS AN END IS REALLY
QUITE AS IDEAL AND ALMOST AS PARADOXICAL TO THE COMMON UNDERSTANDING
AS PLATO'S CONCEPTION OF HAPPINESS
FOR THE GREATEST HAPPINESS OF THE
GREATEST NUMBER MAY MEAN ALSO THE GREATEST PAIN OF THE INDIVIDUAL WHICH
WILL PROCURE THE GREATEST PLEASURE OF THE GREATEST NUMBER
IDEAS OF
UTILITY LIKE THOSE OF DUTY AND RIGHT MAY BE PUSHED TO UNPLEASANT
CONSEQUENCES
NOR CAN PLATO IN THE GORGIAS BE DEEMED PURELY
SELF REGARDING CONSIDERING THAT SOCRATES EXPRESSLY MENTIONS THE DUTY OF
IMPARTING THE TRUTH WHEN DISCOVERED TO OTHERS
NOR MUST WE FORGET THAT
THE SIDE OF ETHICS WHICH REGARDS OTHERS IS BY THE ANCIENTS MERGED IN
POLITICS
BOTH IN PLATO AND ARISTOTLE AS WELL AS IN THE STOICS
THE SOCIAL PRINCIPLE THOUGH TAKING ANOTHER FORM IS REALLY FAR MORE
PROMINENT THAN IN MOST MODERN TREATISES ON ETHICS
THE IDEALIZING OF SUFFERING IS ONE OF THE CONCEPTIONS WHICH HAVE
EXERCISED THE GREATEST INFLUENCE ON MANKIND
INTO THE THEOLOGICAL IMPORT
OF THIS OR INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE ERRORS TO WHICH THE IDEA MAY
HAVE GIVEN RISE WE NEED NOT NOW ENTER
ALL WILL AGREE THAT THE IDEAL OF
THE DIVINE SUFFERER WHOSE WORDS THE WORLD WOULD NOT RECEIVE THE MAN OF
SORROWS OF WHOM THE HEBREW PROPHETS SPOKE HAS SUNK DEEP INTO THE HEART
OF THE HUMAN RACE
IT IS A SIMILAR PICTURE OF SUFFERING GOODNESS WHICH
PLATO DESIRES TO POURTRAY NOT WITHOUT AN ALLUSION TO THE FATE OF HIS
MASTER SOCRATES
HE IS CONVINCED THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER SUCH AN ONE
MUST BE HAPPY IN LIFE OR AFTER DEATH
IN THE REPUBLIC HE ENDEAVOURS TO
SHOW THAT HIS HAPPINESS WOULD BE ASSURED HERE IN A WELL ORDERED STATE
BUT IN THE ACTUAL CONDITION OF HUMAN THINGS THE WISE AND GOOD ARE WEAK
AND MISERABLE SUCH AN ONE IS LIKE A MAN FALLEN AMONG WILD BEASTS
EXPOSED TO EVERY SORT OF WRONG AND OBLOQUY
PLATO LIKE OTHER PHILOSOPHERS IS THUS LED ON TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
IF 'THE WAYS OF GOD' TO MAN ARE TO BE 'JUSTIFIED THE HOPES OF ANOTHER
LIFE MUST BE INCLUDED
IF THE QUESTION COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO HIM
WHETHER A MAN DYING IN TORMENTS WAS HAPPY STILL EVEN IF AS HE SUGGESTS
IN THE APOLOGY 'DEATH BE ONLY A LONG SLEEP WE CAN HARDLY TELL
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS ANSWER
THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW WHO QUITE
INDEPENDENTLY OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS OR OF POSTHUMOUS REPUTATION
OR ANY OTHER INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC OPINION HAVE BEEN WILLING TO SACRIFICE
THEIR LIVES FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW FAR IN
SUCH CASES AN UNCONSCIOUS HOPE OF A FUTURE LIFE OR A GENERAL FAITH IN
THE VICTORY OF GOOD IN THE WORLD MAY HAVE SUPPORTED THE SUFFERERS
BUT
THIS EXTREME IDEALISM IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO
HE
SUPPOSES A DAY OF RETRIBUTION IN WHICH THE GOOD ARE TO BE REWARDED AND
THE WICKED PUNISHED
THOUGH AS HE SAYS IN THE PHAEDO NO MAN OF SENSE
WILL MAINTAIN THAT THE DETAILS OF THE STORIES ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD ARE
TRUE HE WILL INSIST THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND IS TRUE AND WILL FRAME
HIS LIFE WITH A VIEW TO THIS UNKNOWN FUTURE
EVEN IN THE REPUBLIC HE
INTRODUCES A FUTURE LIFE AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT WHEN THE SUPERIOR HAPPINESS
OF THE JUST HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED ON WHAT IS THOUGHT TO BE AN IMMUTABLE
FOUNDATION
AT THE SAME TIME HE MAKES A POINT OF DETERMINING HIS MAIN
THESIS INDEPENDENTLY OF REMOTER CONSEQUENCES
3 PLATO'S THEORY OF PUNISHMENT IS PARTLY VINDICTIVE PARTLY
CORRECTIVE
IN THE GORGIAS AS WELL AS IN THE PHAEDO AND REPUBLIC A FEW
GREAT CRIMINALS CHIEFLY TYRANTS ARE RESERVED AS EXAMPLES
BUT MOST MEN
HAVE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF ATTAINING THIS PRE EMINENCE OF EVIL
THEY ARE NOT INCURABLE AND THEIR PUNISHMENT IS INTENDED FOR THEIR
IMPROVEMENT
THEY ARE TO SUFFER BECAUSE THEY HAVE SINNED LIKE SICK MEN
THEY MUST GO TO THE PHYSICIAN AND BE HEALED
ON THIS REPRESENTATION OF
PLATO'S THE CRITICISM HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE ANALOGY OF DISEASE AND
INJUSTICE IS PARTIAL ONLY AND THAT SUFFERING INSTEAD OF IMPROVING MEN
MAY HAVE JUST THE OPPOSITE EFFECT
LIKE THE GENERAL ANALOGY OF THE ARTS AND THE VIRTUES THE ANALOGY
OF DISEASE AND INJUSTICE OR OF MEDICINE AND JUSTICE IS CERTAINLY
IMPERFECT
BUT IDEAS MUST BE GIVEN THROUGH SOMETHING THE NATURE OF THE
MIND WHICH IS UNSEEN CAN ONLY BE REPRESENTED UNDER FIGURES DERIVED FROM
VISIBLE OBJECTS
IF THESE FIGURES ARE SUGGESTIVE OF SOME NEW ASPECT
UNDER WHICH THE MIND MAY BE CONSIDERED WE CANNOT FIND FAULT WITH THEM
FOR NOT EXACTLY COINCIDING WITH THE IDEAS REPRESENTED
THEY PARTAKE
OF THE IMPERFECT NATURE OF LANGUAGE AND MUST NOT BE CONSTRUED IN TOO
STRICT A MANNER
THAT PLATO SOMETIMES REASONS FROM THEM AS IF THEY WERE
NOT FIGURES BUT REALITIES IS DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE LOGICAL ANALYSIS OF
HIS AGE
NOR DOES HE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE SUFFERING WHICH IMPROVES AND THE
SUFFERING WHICH ONLY PUNISHES AND DETERS
HE APPLIES TO THE SPHERE OF
ETHICS A CONCEPTION OF PUNISHMENT WHICH IS REALLY DERIVED FROM CRIMINAL
LAW
HE DOES NOT SEE THAT SUCH PUNISHMENT IS ONLY NEGATIVE AND SUPPLIES
NO PRINCIPLE OF MORAL GROWTH OR DEVELOPMENT
HE IS NOT FAR OFF THE
HIGHER NOTION OF AN EDUCATION OF MAN TO BE BEGUN IN THIS WORLD AND TO
BE CONTINUED IN OTHER STAGES OF EXISTENCE WHICH IS FURTHER DEVELOPED
IN THE REPUBLIC
AND CHRISTIAN THINKERS WHO HAVE VENTURED OUT OF THE
BEATEN TRACK IN THEIR MEDITATIONS ON THE 'LAST THINGS HAVE FOUND A RAY
OF LIGHT IN HIS WRITINGS
BUT HE HAS NOT EXPLAINED HOW OR IN WHAT WAY
PUNISHMENT IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF MANKIND
HE HAS NOT
FOLLOWED OUT THE PRINCIPLE WHICH HE AFFIRMS IN THE REPUBLIC THAT 'GOD
IS THE AUTHOR OF EVIL ONLY WITH A VIEW TO GOOD AND THAT 'THEY WERE
THE BETTER FOR BEING PUNISHED STILL HIS DOCTRINE OF A FUTURE STATE OF
REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS MAY BE COMPARED FAVOURABLY WITH THAT PERVERSION
OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE WHICH MAKES THE EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT OF HUMAN
BEINGS DEPEND ON A BRIEF MOMENT OF TIME OR EVEN ON THE ACCIDENT OF
AN ACCIDENT
AND HE HAS ESCAPED THE DIFFICULTY WHICH HAS OFTEN BESET
DIVINES RESPECTING THE FUTURE DESTINY OF THE MEANER SORT OF MEN
THERSITES AND THE LIKE WHO ARE NEITHER VERY GOOD NOR VERY BAD BY NOT
COUNTING THEM WORTHY OF ETERNAL DAMNATION
WE DO PLATO VIOLENCE IN PRESSING HIS FIGURES OF SPEECH OR CHAINS OF
ARGUMENT AND NOT LESS SO IN ASKING QUESTIONS WHICH WERE BEYOND THE
HORIZON OF HIS VISION OR DID NOT COME WITHIN THE SCOPE OF HIS DESIGN
THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE GORGIAS IS NOT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT A
FUTURE WORLD BUT TO PLACE IN ANTAGONISM THE TRUE AND FALSE LIFE AND
TO CONTRAST THE JUDGMENTS AND OPINIONS OF MEN WITH JUDGMENT ACCORDING
TO THE TRUTH
PLATO MAY BE ACCUSED OF REPRESENTING A SUPERHUMAN OR
TRANSCENDENTAL VIRTUE IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE JUST MAN IN THE GORGIAS
OR IN THE COMPANION PORTRAIT OF THE PHILOSOPHER IN THE THEAETETUS AND
AT THE SAME TIME MAY BE THOUGHT TO BE CONDEMNING A STATE OF THE WORLD
WHICH ALWAYS HAS EXISTED AND ALWAYS WILL EXIST AMONG MEN
BUT
SUCH IDEALS ACT POWERFULLY ON THE IMAGINATION OF MANKIND
AND SUCH
CONDEMNATIONS ARE NOT MERE PARADOXES OF PHILOSOPHERS BUT THE NATURAL
REBELLION OF THE HIGHER SENSE OF RIGHT IN MAN AGAINST THE ORDINARY
CONDITIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
THE GREATEST STATESMEN HAVE FALLEN VERY FAR
SHORT OF THE POLITICAL IDEAL AND ARE THEREFORE JUSTLY INVOLVED IN THE
GENERAL CONDEMNATION
SUBORDINATE TO THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE DIALOGUE ARE SOME OTHER
QUESTIONS WHICH MAY BE BRIEFLY CONSIDERED
A
THE ANTITHESIS OF GOOD AND PLEASURE WHICH AS IN OTHER DIALOGUES IS
SUPPOSED TO CONSIST IN THE PERMANENT NATURE OF THE ONE COMPARED WITH THE
TRANSIENT AND RELATIVE NATURE OF THE OTHER
GOOD AND PLEASURE KNOWLEDGE
AND SENSE TRUTH AND OPINION ESSENCE AND GENERATION VIRTUE AND
PLEASURE THE REAL AND THE APPARENT THE INFINITE AND FINITE HARMONY OR
BEAUTY AND DISCORD DIALECTIC AND RHETORIC OR POETRY ARE SO MANY PAIRS
OF OPPOSITES WHICH IN PLATO EASILY PASS INTO ONE ANOTHER AND ARE
SELDOM KEPT PERFECTLY DISTINCT
AND WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT PLATO'S
CONCEPTION OF PLEASURE IS THE HERACLEITEAN FLUX TRANSFERRED TO THE
SPHERE OF HUMAN CONDUCT
THERE IS SOME DEGREE OF UNFAIRNESS IN OPPOSING
THE PRINCIPLE OF GOOD WHICH IS OBJECTIVE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PLEASURE
WHICH IS SUBJECTIVE
FOR THE ASSERTION OF THE PERMANENCE OF GOOD IS ONLY
BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION OF ITS OBJECTIVE CHARACTER
HAD PLATO FIXED
HIS MIND NOT ON THE IDEAL NATURE OF GOOD BUT ON THE SUBJECTIVE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAPPINESS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE AS
TRANSIENT AND PRECARIOUS AS PLEASURE
B
THE ARTS OR SCIENCES WHEN PURSUED WITHOUT ANY VIEW TO TRUTH OR THE
IMPROVEMENT OF HUMAN LIFE ARE CALLED FLATTERIES
THEY ARE ALL ALIKE
DEPENDENT UPON THE OPINION OF MANKIND FROM WHICH THEY ARE DERIVED
TO PLATO THE WHOLE WORLD APPEARS TO BE SUNK IN ERROR BASED ON
SELF INTEREST
TO THIS IS OPPOSED THE ONE WISE MAN HARDLY PROFESSING TO
HAVE FOUND TRUTH YET STRONG IN THE CONVICTION THAT A VIRTUOUS LIFE
IS THE ONLY GOOD WHETHER REGARDED WITH REFERENCE TO THIS WORLD OR TO
ANOTHER
STATESMEN SOPHISTS RHETORICIANS POETS ARE ALIKE BROUGHT UP
FOR JUDGMENT
THEY ARE THE PARODIES OF WISE MEN AND THEIR ARTS ARE THE
PARODIES OF TRUE ARTS AND SCIENCES
ALL THAT THEY CALL SCIENCE IS MERELY
THE RESULT OF THAT STUDY OF THE TEMPERS OF THE GREAT BEAST WHICH HE
DESCRIBES IN THE REPUBLIC
C
VARIOUS OTHER POINTS OF CONTACT NATURALLY SUGGEST THEMSELVES BETWEEN
THE GORGIAS AND OTHER DIALOGUES ESPECIALLY THE REPUBLIC THE PHILEBUS
AND THE PROTAGORAS
THERE ARE CLOSER RESEMBLANCES BOTH OF SPIRIT
AND LANGUAGE IN THE REPUBLIC THAN IN ANY OTHER DIALOGUE THE VERBAL
SIMILARITY TENDING TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE WRITTEN AT THE SAME PERIOD OF
PLATO'S LIFE
FOR THE REPUBLIC SUPPLIES THAT EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF
WHICH THE GORGIAS SUGGESTS THE NECESSITY
THE THEORY OF THE MANY WEAK
COMBINING AGAINST THE FEW STRONG IN THE FORMATION OF SOCIETY WHICH IS
INDEED A PARTIAL TRUTH IS SIMILAR IN BOTH OF THEM AND IS EXPRESSED IN
NEARLY THE SAME LANGUAGE
THE SUFFERINGS AND FATE OF THE JUST MAN THE
POWERLESSNESS OF EVIL AND THE REVERSAL OF THE SITUATION IN ANOTHER
LIFE ARE ALSO POINTS OF SIMILARITY
THE POETS LIKE THE RHETORICIANS
ARE CONDEMNED BECAUSE THEY AIM AT PLEASURE ONLY AS IN THE REPUBLIC THEY
ARE EXPELLED THE STATE BECAUSE THEY ARE IMITATORS AND MINISTER TO
THE WEAKER SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE
THAT POETRY IS AKIN TO RHETORIC MAY BE
COMPARED WITH THE ANALOGOUS NOTION WHICH OCCURS IN THE PROTAGORAS THAT
THE ANCIENT POETS WERE THE SOPHISTS OF THEIR DAY
IN SOME OTHER RESPECTS
THE PROTAGORAS RATHER OFFERS A CONTRAST THAN A PARALLEL
THE CHARACTER
OF PROTAGORAS MAY BE COMPARED WITH THAT OF GORGIAS BUT THE CONCEPTION
OF HAPPINESS IS DIFFERENT IN THE TWO DIALOGUES BEING DESCRIBED IN THE
FORMER ACCORDING TO THE OLD SOCRATIC NOTION AS DEFERRED OR ACCUMULATED
PLEASURE WHILE IN THE GORGIAS AND IN THE PHAEDO PLEASURE AND GOOD ARE
DISTINCTLY OPPOSED
THIS OPPOSITION IS CARRIED OUT FROM A SPECULATIVE POINT OF VIEW IN THE
PHILEBUS
THERE NEITHER PLEASURE NOR WISDOM ARE ALLOWED TO BE THE CHIEF
GOOD BUT PLEASURE AND GOOD ARE NOT SO COMPLETELY OPPOSED AS IN THE
GORGIAS
FOR INNOCENT PLEASURES AND SUCH AS HAVE NO ANTECEDENT PAINS
ARE ALLOWED TO RANK IN THE CLASS OF GOODS
THE ALLUSION TO GORGIAS'
DEFINITION OF RHETORIC PHILEBUS COMPARE GORG AS THE ART OF
PERSUASION OF ALL ARTS THE BEST FOR TO IT ALL THINGS SUBMIT NOT
BY COMPULSION BUT OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL MARKS A CLOSE AND PERHAPS
DESIGNED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO DIALOGUES
IN BOTH THE IDEAS OF
MEASURE ORDER HARMONY ARE THE CONNECTING LINKS BETWEEN THE BEAUTIFUL
AND THE GOOD
IN GENERAL SPIRIT AND CHARACTER THAT IS IN IRONY AND ANTAGONISM TO
PUBLIC OPINION THE GORGIAS MOST NEARLY RESEMBLES THE APOLOGY CRITO
AND PORTIONS OF THE REPUBLIC AND LIKE THE PHILEBUS THOUGH FROM ANOTHER
POINT OF VIEW MAY BE THOUGHT TO STAND IN THE SAME RELATION TO PLATO'S
THEORY OF MORALS WHICH THE THEAETETUS BEARS TO HIS THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
D
A FEW MINOR POINTS STILL REMAIN TO BE SUMMED UP 1 THE EXTRAVAGANT
IRONY IN THE REASON WHICH IS ASSIGNED FOR THE PILOT'S MODEST CHARGE AND
IN THE PROPOSED USE OF RHETORIC AS AN INSTRUMENT OF SELF CONDEMNATION
AND IN THE MIGHTY POWER OF GEOMETRICAL EQUALITY IN BOTH WORLDS
2
THE REFERENCE OF THE MYTHUS TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION SHOULD NOT BE
OVERLOOKED THE FATE RESERVED FOR INCURABLE CRIMINALS SUCH AS ARCHELAUS
THE RETALIATION OF THE BOX ON THE EARS THE NAKEDNESS OF THE SOULS AND
OF THE JUDGES WHO ARE STRIPT OF THE CLOTHES OR DISGUISES WHICH RHETORIC
AND PUBLIC OPINION HAVE HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM COMPARE SWIFT'S
NOTION THAT THE UNIVERSE IS A SUIT OF CLOTHES TALE OF A TUB
THE
FICTION SEEMS TO HAVE INVOLVED PLATO IN THE NECESSITY OF SUPPOSING THAT
THE SOUL RETAINED A SORT OF CORPOREAL LIKENESS AFTER DEATH
3 THE
APPEAL OF THE AUTHORITY OF HOMER WHO SAYS THAT ODYSSEUS SAW MINOS IN
HIS COURT 'HOLDING A GOLDEN SCEPTRE WHICH GIVES VERISIMILITUDE TO THE
TALE
IT IS SCARCELY NECESSARY TO REPEAT THAT PLATO IS PLAYING 'BOTH SIDES OF
THE GAME AND THAT IN CRITICISING THE CHARACTERS OF GORGIAS AND POLUS
WE ARE NOT PASSING ANY JUDGMENT ON HISTORICAL INDIVIDUALS BUT ONLY
ATTEMPTING TO ANALYZE THE 'DRAMATIS PERSONAE' AS THEY WERE CONCEIVED BY
HIM
NEITHER IS IT NECESSARY TO ENLARGE UPON THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT PLATO
IS A DRAMATIC WRITER WHOSE REAL OPINIONS CANNOT ALWAYS BE ASSUMED TO BE
THOSE WHICH HE PUTS INTO THE MOUTH OF SOCRATES OR ANY OTHER SPEAKER WHO
APPEARS TO HAVE THE BEST OF THE ARGUMENT OR TO REPEAT THE OBSERVATION
THAT HE IS A POET AS WELL AS A PHILOSOPHER OR TO REMARK THAT HE IS NOT
TO BE TRIED BY A MODERN STANDARD BUT INTERPRETED WITH REFERENCE TO HIS
PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF THOUGHT AND THE OPINION OF HIS TIME
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE GORGIAS
IS THE ASSERTION OF THE RIGHT OF DISSENT OR PRIVATE JUDGMENT
BUT THIS
MODE OF STATING THE QUESTION IS REALLY OPPOSED BOTH TO THE SPIRIT OF
PLATO AND OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY GENERALLY
FOR PLATO IS NOT ASSERTING
ANY ABSTRACT RIGHT OR DUTY OF TOLERATION OR ADVANTAGE TO BE DERIVED
FROM FREEDOM OF THOUGHT INDEED IN SOME OTHER PARTS OF HIS WRITINGS
E G
LAWS HE HAS FAIRLY LAID HIMSELF OPEN TO THE CHARGE OF
INTOLERANCE
NO SPECULATIONS HAD AS YET ARISEN RESPECTING THE 'LIBERTY
OF PROPHESYING AND PLATO IS NOT AFFIRMING ANY ABSTRACT RIGHT OF THIS
NATURE BUT HE IS ASSERTING THE DUTY AND RIGHT OF THE ONE WISE AND TRUE
MAN TO DISSENT FROM THE FOLLY AND FALSEHOOD OF THE MANY
AT THE SAME
TIME HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE NATURAL RESULT WHICH HE HARDLY SEEKS TO AVERT
THAT HE WHO SPEAKS THE TRUTH TO A MULTITUDE REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES
WILL PROBABLY SHARE THE FATE OF SOCRATES
THE IRONY OF PLATO SOMETIMES VEILS FROM US THE HEIGHT OF IDEALISM TO
WHICH HE SOARS
WHEN DECLARING TRUTHS WHICH THE MANY WILL NOT RECEIVE
HE PUTS ON AN ARMOUR WHICH CANNOT BE PIERCED BY THEM
THE WEAPONS OF
RIDICULE ARE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR HANDS AND THE LAUGH IS TURNED AGAINST
THEMSELVES
THE DISGUISES WHICH SOCRATES ASSUMES ARE LIKE THE PARABLES
OF THE NEW TESTAMENT OR THE ORACLES OF THE DELPHIAN GOD THEY HALF
CONCEAL HALF REVEAL HIS MEANING
THE MORE HE IS IN EARNEST THE MORE
IRONICAL HE BECOMES AND HE IS NEVER MORE IN EARNEST OR MORE IRONICAL
THAN IN THE GORGIAS
HE HARDLY TROUBLES HIMSELF TO ANSWER SERIOUSLY THE
OBJECTIONS OF GORGIAS AND POLUS AND THEREFORE HE SOMETIMES APPEARS TO
BE CARELESS OF THE ORDINARY REQUIREMENTS OF LOGIC
YET IN THE HIGHEST
SENSE HE IS ALWAYS LOGICAL AND CONSISTENT WITH HIMSELF
THE FORM OF THE
ARGUMENT MAY BE PARADOXICAL THE SUBSTANCE IS AN APPEAL TO THE HIGHER
REASON
HE IS UTTERING TRUTHS BEFORE THEY CAN BE UNDERSTOOD AS IN ALL
AGES THE WORDS OF PHILOSOPHERS WHEN THEY ARE FIRST UTTERED HAVE FOUND
THE WORLD UNPREPARED FOR THEM
A FURTHER MISUNDERSTANDING ARISES OUT OF
THE WILDNESS OF HIS HUMOUR HE IS SUPPOSED NOT ONLY BY CALLICLES BUT
BY THE REST OF MANKIND TO BE JESTING WHEN HE IS PROFOUNDLY SERIOUS
AT
LENGTH HE MAKES EVEN POLUS IN EARNEST
FINALLY HE DROPS THE ARGUMENT
AND HEEDLESS ANY LONGER OF THE FORMS OF DIALECTIC HE LOSES HIMSELF IN
A SORT OF TRIUMPH WHILE AT THE SAME TIME HE RETALIATES UPON HIS
ADVERSARIES
FROM THIS CONFUSION OF JEST AND EARNEST WE MAY NOW RETURN
TO THE IDEAL TRUTH AND DRAW OUT IN A SIMPLE FORM THE MAIN THESES OF THE
DIALOGUE
FIRST THESIS
IT IS A GREATER EVIL TO DO THAN TO SUFFER INJUSTICE
COMPARE THE NEW TESTAMENT
'IT IS BETTER TO SUFFER FOR WELL DOING THAN FOR EVIL DOING 1 PET
AND THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT
'BLESSED ARE THEY THAT ARE PERSECUTED FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE MATT
THE WORDS OF SOCRATES ARE MORE ABSTRACT THAN THE WORDS OF CHRIST BUT
THEY EQUALLY IMPLY THAT THE ONLY REAL EVIL IS MORAL EVIL
THE RIGHTEOUS
MAY SUFFER OR DIE BUT THEY HAVE THEIR REWARD AND EVEN IF THEY HAD
NO REWARD WOULD BE HAPPIER THAN THE WICKED
THE WORLD REPRESENTED BY
POLUS IS READY WHEN THEY ARE ASKED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INJUSTICE IS
DISHONOURABLE AND FOR THEIR OWN SAKES MEN ARE WILLING TO PUNISH
THE OFFENDER COMPARE REPUBLIC
BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUALLY WILLING TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INJUSTICE EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL IS ESSENTIALLY EVIL
AND HAS THE NATURE OF DISEASE AND DEATH
ESPECIALLY WHEN CRIMES
ARE COMMITTED ON THE GREAT SCALE THE CRIMES OF TYRANTS ANCIENT OR
MODERN AFTER A WHILE SEEING THAT THEY CANNOT BE UNDONE AND HAVE
BECOME A PART OF HISTORY MANKIND ARE DISPOSED TO FORGIVE THEM NOT FROM
ANY MAGNANIMITY OR CHARITY BUT BECAUSE THEIR FEELINGS ARE BLUNTED BY
TIME AND 'TO FORGIVE IS CONVENIENT TO THEM THE TANGLE OF GOOD AND
EVIL CAN NO LONGER BE UNRAVELLED AND ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW THAT THE END
CANNOT JUSTIFY THE MEANS THEY FEEL ALSO THAT GOOD HAS OFTEN COME OUT
OF EVIL
BUT SOCRATES WOULD HAVE US PASS THE SAME JUDGMENT ON THE TYRANT
NOW AND ALWAYS THOUGH HE IS SURROUNDED BY HIS SATELLITES AND HAS
THE APPLAUSES OF EUROPE AND ASIA RINGING IN HIS EARS THOUGH HE IS THE
CIVILIZER OR LIBERATOR OF HALF A CONTINENT HE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE
THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN
THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCES FOR GOOD OR FOR
EVIL CANNOT ALTER A HAIR'S BREADTH THE MORALITY OF ACTIONS WHICH ARE
RIGHT OR WRONG IN THEMSELVES
THIS IS THE STANDARD WHICH SOCRATES HOLDS
UP TO US
BECAUSE POLITICS AND PERHAPS HUMAN LIFE GENERALLY ARE OF A
MIXED NATURE WE MUST NOT ALLOW OUR PRINCIPLES TO SINK TO THE LEVEL OF
OUR PRACTICE
AND SO OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO THEM TOO THE WORLD OCCASIONALLY
SPEAKS OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS IF THEY ARE LOVERS OF
PLEASURE THEY WILL RUIN THEIR HEALTH IF THEY ARE FALSE OR DISHONEST
THEY WILL LOSE THEIR CHARACTER
BUT SOCRATES WOULD SPEAK TO THEM NOT OF
WHAT WILL BE BUT OF WHAT IS OF THE PRESENT CONSEQUENCE OF LOWERING
AND DEGRADING THE SOUL
AND ALL HIGHER NATURES OR PERHAPS ALL MEN
EVERYWHERE IF THEY WERE NOT TEMPTED BY INTEREST OR PASSION WOULD AGREE
WITH HIM THEY WOULD RATHER BE THE VICTIMS THAN THE PERPETRATORS OF
AN ACT OF TREACHERY OR OF TYRANNY
REASON TELLS THEM THAT DEATH COMES
SOONER OR LATER TO ALL AND IS NOT SO GREAT AN EVIL AS AN UNWORTHY LIFE
OR RATHER IF RIGHTLY REGARDED NOT AN EVIL AT ALL BUT TO A GOOD MAN
THE GREATEST GOOD
FOR IN ALL OF US THERE ARE SLUMBERING IDEALS OF TRUTH
AND RIGHT WHICH MAY AT ANY TIME AWAKEN AND DEVELOP A NEW LIFE IN US
SECOND THESIS
IT IS BETTER TO SUFFER FOR WRONG DOING THAN NOT TO SUFFER
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CONDITION OF HUMAN LIFE IN WHICH THE PENALTY
FOLLOWED AT ONCE AND WAS PROPORTIONED TO THE OFFENCE
MORAL EVIL WOULD
THEN BE SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM PHYSICAL MANKIND WOULD AVOID VICE
AS THEY AVOID PAIN OR DEATH
BUT NATURE WITH A VIEW OF DEEPENING AND
ENLARGING OUR CHARACTERS HAS FOR THE MOST PART HIDDEN FROM US THE
CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS AND WE CAN ONLY FORESEE THEM BY AN EFFORT
OF REFLECTION
TO AWAKEN IN US THIS HABIT OF REFLECTION IS THE BUSINESS
OF EARLY EDUCATION WHICH IS CONTINUED IN MATURER YEARS BY OBSERVATION
AND EXPERIENCE
THE SPOILT CHILD IS IN LATER LIFE SAID TO BE
UNFORTUNATE HE HAD BETTER HAVE SUFFERED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND BEEN
SAVED FROM SUFFERING AFTERWARDS
BUT IS NOT THE SOVEREIGN EQUALLY
UNFORTUNATE WHOSE EDUCATION AND MANNER OF LIFE ARE ALWAYS CONCEALING
FROM HIM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS OWN ACTIONS UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ARE
REVEALED TO HIM IN SOME TERRIBLE DOWNFALL WHICH MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN
CAUSED NOT BY HIS OWN FAULT ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION IS AFFORDED BY THE
PAUPER AND CRIMINAL CLASSES WHO SCARCELY REFLECT AT ALL EXCEPT ON THE
MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN COMPASS THEIR IMMEDIATE ENDS
WE PITY THEM AND
MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR THEM BUT WE DO NOT CONSIDER THAT THE SAME PRINCIPLE
APPLIES TO HUMAN ACTIONS GENERALLY
NOT TO HAVE BEEN FOUND OUT IN SOME
DISHONESTY OR FOLLY REGARDED FROM A MORAL OR RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW
IS THE GREATEST OF MISFORTUNES
THE SUCCESS OF OUR EVIL DOINGS IS A
PROOF THAT THE GODS HAVE CEASED TO STRIVE WITH US AND HAVE GIVEN
US OVER TO OURSELVES
THERE IS NOTHING TO REMIND US OF OUR SINS AND
THEREFORE NOTHING TO CORRECT THEM
LIKE OUR SORROWS THEY ARE HEALED BY
TIME
'WHILE RANK CORRUPTION MINING ALL WITHIN
INFECTS UNSEEN
THE 'ACCUSTOMED IRONY' OF SOCRATES ADDS A COROLLARY TO THE
ARGUMENT 'WOULD YOU PUNISH YOUR ENEMY YOU SHOULD ALLOW HIM TO ESCAPE
UNPUNISHED' THIS IS THE TRUE RETALIATION
COMPARE THE OBSCURE VERSE OF
PROVERBS 'THEREFORE IF THINE ENEMY HUNGER FEED HIM ETC QUOTED IN
ROMANS
MEN ARE NOT IN THE HABIT OF DWELLING UPON THE DARK SIDE OF THEIR OWN
LIVES THEY DO NOT EASILY SEE THEMSELVES AS OTHERS SEE THEM
THEY ARE
VERY KIND AND VERY BLIND TO THEIR OWN FAULTS THE RHETORIC OF SELF LOVE
IS ALWAYS PLEADING WITH THEM ON THEIR OWN BEHALF
ADOPTING A SIMILAR
FIGURE OF SPEECH SOCRATES WOULD HAVE THEM USE RHETORIC NOT IN DEFENCE
BUT IN ACCUSATION OF THEMSELVES
AS THEY ARE GUIDED BY FEELING RATHER
THAN BY REASON TO THEIR FEELINGS THE APPEAL MUST BE MADE
THEY MUST
SPEAK TO THEMSELVES THEY MUST ARGUE WITH THEMSELVES THEY MUST PAINT IN
ELOQUENT WORDS THE CHARACTER OF THEIR OWN EVIL DEEDS
TO ANY SUFFERING
WHICH THEY HAVE DESERVED THEY MUST PERSUADE THEMSELVES TO SUBMIT
UNDER
THE FIGURE THERE LURKS A REAL THOUGHT WHICH EXPRESSED IN ANOTHER FORM
ADMITS OF AN EASY APPLICATION TO OURSELVES
FOR DO NOT WE TOO ACCUSE AS
WELL AS EXCUSE OURSELVES AND WE CALL TO OUR AID THE RHETORIC OF PRAYER
AND PREACHING WHICH THE MIND SILENTLY EMPLOYS WHILE THE STRUGGLE
BETWEEN THE BETTER AND THE WORSE IS GOING ON WITHIN US
AND SOMETIMES
WE ARE TOO HARD UPON OURSELVES BECAUSE WE WANT TO RESTORE THE BALANCE
WHICH SELF LOVE HAS OVERTHROWN OR DISTURBED AND THEN AGAIN WE MAY HEAR
A VOICE AS OF A PARENT CONSOLING US
IN RELIGIOUS DIARIES A SORT OF
DRAMA IS OFTEN ENACTED BY THE CONSCIENCES OF MEN 'ACCUSING OR
ELSE EXCUSING THEM FOR ALL OUR LIFE LONG WE ARE TALKING WITH
OURSELVES WHAT IS THOUGHT BUT SPEECH WHAT IS FEELING BUT RHETORIC
AND IF RHETORIC IS USED ON ONE SIDE ONLY WE SHALL BE ALWAYS IN DANGER
OF BEING DECEIVED
AND SO THE WORDS OF SOCRATES WHICH AT FIRST SOUNDED
PARADOXICAL COME HOME TO THE EXPERIENCE OF ALL OF US
THIRD THESIS
WE DO NOT WHAT WE WILL BUT WHAT WE WISH
SOCRATES WOULD TEACH US A LESSON WHICH WE ARE SLOW TO LEARN THAT GOOD
INTENTIONS AND EVEN BENEVOLENT ACTIONS WHEN THEY ARE NOT PROMPTED BY
WISDOM ARE OF NO VALUE
WE BELIEVE SOMETHING TO BE FOR OUR GOOD WHICH
WE AFTERWARDS FIND OUT NOT TO BE FOR OUR GOOD
THE CONSEQUENCES MAY BE
INEVITABLE FOR THEY MAY FOLLOW AN INVARIABLE LAW YET THEY MAY OFTEN BE
THE VERY OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS EXPECTED BY US
WHEN WE INCREASE PAUPERISM
BY ALMSGIVING WHEN WE TIE UP PROPERTY WITHOUT REGARD TO CHANGES OF
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN WE SAY HASTILY WHAT WE DELIBERATELY DISAPPROVE WHEN
WE DO IN A MOMENT OF PASSION WHAT UPON REFLECTION WE REGRET WHEN FROM
ANY WANT OF SELF CONTROL WE GIVE ANOTHER AN ADVANTAGE OVER US WE ARE
DOING NOT WHAT WE WILL BUT WHAT WE WISH
ALL ACTIONS OF WHICH THE
CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT WEIGHED AND FORESEEN ARE OF THIS IMPOTENT AND
PARALYTIC SORT AND THE AUTHOR OF THEM HAS 'THE LEAST POSSIBLE POWER'
WHILE SEEMING TO HAVE THE GREATEST
FOR HE IS ACTUALLY BRINGING ABOUT
THE REVERSE OF WHAT HE INTENDED
AND YET THE BOOK OF NATURE IS OPEN
TO HIM IN WHICH HE WHO RUNS MAY READ IF HE WILL EXERCISE ORDINARY
ATTENTION EVERY DAY OFFERS HIM EXPERIENCES OF HIS OWN AND OF OTHER
MEN'S CHARACTERS AND HE PASSES THEM UNHEEDED BY
THE CONTEMPLATION OF
THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIONS AND THE IGNORANCE OF MEN IN REGARD TO THEM
SEEMS TO HAVE LED SOCRATES TO HIS FAMOUS THESIS 'VIRTUE IS KNOWLEDGE
WHICH IS NOT SO MUCH AN ERROR OR PARADOX AS A HALF TRUTH SEEN FIRST IN
THE TWILIGHT OF ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY BUT ALSO THE HALF OF THE TRUTH WHICH
IS ESPECIALLY NEEDED IN THE PRESENT AGE
FOR AS THE WORLD HAS GROWN
OLDER MEN HAVE BEEN TOO APT TO IMAGINE A RIGHT AND WRONG APART FROM
CONSEQUENCES WHILE A FEW ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE SOUGHT TO RESOLVE
THEM WHOLLY INTO THEIR CONSEQUENCES
BUT SOCRATES OR PLATO FOR HIM
NEITHER DIVIDES NOR IDENTIFIES THEM THOUGH THE TIME HAS NOT YET ARRIVED
EITHER FOR UTILITARIAN OR TRANSCENDENTAL SYSTEMS OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY HE
RECOGNIZES THE TWO ELEMENTS WHICH SEEM TO LIE AT THE BASIS OF MORALITY
COMPARE THE FOLLOWING 'NOW AND FOR US IT IS A TIME TO HELLENIZE AND
TO PRAISE KNOWING FOR WE HAVE HEBRAIZED TOO MUCH AND HAVE OVERVALUED
DOING
BUT THE HABITS AND DISCIPLINE RECEIVED FROM HEBRAISM REMAIN FOR
OUR RACE AN ETERNAL POSSESSION
AND AS HUMANITY IS CONSTITUTED ONE MUST
NEVER ASSIGN THE SECOND RANK TO DAY WITHOUT BEING READY TO RESTORE THEM
TO THE FIRST TO MORROW SIR WILLIAM W
HUNTER PREFACE TO ORISSA
FOURTH THESIS
TO BE AND NOT TO SEEM IS THE END OF LIFE
THE GREEK IN THE AGE OF PLATO ADMITTED PRAISE TO BE ONE OF THE CHIEF
INCENTIVES TO MORAL VIRTUE AND TO MOST MEN THE OPINION OF THEIR FELLOWS
IS A LEADING PRINCIPLE OF ACTION
HENCE A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF SEEMING
ENTERS INTO ALL THINGS ALL OR ALMOST ALL DESIRE TO APPEAR BETTER THAN
THEY ARE THAT THEY MAY WIN THE ESTEEM OR ADMIRATION OF OTHERS
A MAN OF
ABILITY CAN EASILY FEIGN THE LANGUAGE OF PIETY OR VIRTUE AND THERE
IS AN UNCONSCIOUS AS WELL AS A CONSCIOUS HYPOCRISY WHICH ACCORDING
TO SOCRATES IS THE WORST OF THE TWO
AGAIN THERE IS THE SOPHISTRY
OF CLASSES AND PROFESSIONS
THERE ARE THE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT
THEMSELVES AND ONE ANOTHER WHICH PREVAIL IN DIFFERENT RANKS OF SOCIETY
THERE IS THE BIAS GIVEN TO THE MIND BY THE STUDY OF ONE DEPARTMENT
OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE REST AND STRONGER FAR THE
PREJUDICE ENGENDERED BY A PECUNIARY OR PARTY INTEREST IN CERTAIN TENETS
THERE IS THE SOPHISTRY OF LAW THE SOPHISTRY OF MEDICINE THE SOPHISTRY
OF POLITICS THE SOPHISTRY OF THEOLOGY
ALL OF THESE DISGUISES WEAR THE
APPEARANCE OF THE TRUTH SOME OF THEM ARE VERY ANCIENT AND WE DO NOT
EASILY DISENGAGE OURSELVES FROM THEM FOR WE HAVE INHERITED THEM AND
THEY HAVE BECOME A PART OF US
THE SOPHISTRY OF AN ANCIENT GREEK SOPHIST
IS NOTHING COMPARED WITH THE SOPHISTRY OF A RELIGIOUS ORDER OR OF A
CHURCH IN WHICH DURING MANY AGES FALSEHOOD HAS BEEN ACCUMULATING AND
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SAID ON ONE SIDE AND NOTHING ON THE OTHER
THE
CONVENTIONS AND CUSTOMS WHICH WE OBSERVE IN CONVERSATION AND THE
OPPOSITION OF OUR INTERESTS WHEN WE HAVE DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER 'THE
BUYER SAITH IT IS NOUGHT IT IS NOUGHT ETC ARE ALWAYS OBSCURING
OUR SENSE OF TRUTH AND RIGHT
THE SOPHISTRY OF HUMAN NATURE IS FAR MORE
SUBTLE THAN THE DECEIT OF ANY ONE MAN
FEW PERSONS SPEAK FREELY FROM
THEIR OWN NATURES AND SCARCELY ANY ONE DARES TO THINK FOR HIMSELF MOST
OF US IMPERCEPTIBLY FALL INTO THE OPINIONS OF THOSE AROUND US WHICH
WE PARTLY HELP TO MAKE
A MAN WHO WOULD SHAKE HIMSELF LOOSE FROM THEM
REQUIRES GREAT FORCE OF MIND HE HARDLY KNOWS WHERE TO BEGIN IN THE
SEARCH AFTER TRUTH
ON EVERY SIDE HE IS MET BY THE WORLD WHICH IS NOT
AN ABSTRACTION OF THEOLOGIANS BUT THE MOST REAL OF ALL THINGS BEING
ANOTHER NAME FOR OURSELVES WHEN REGARDED COLLECTIVELY AND SUBJECTED TO
THE INFLUENCES OF SOCIETY
THEN COMES SOCRATES IMPRESSED AS NO OTHER MAN EVER WAS WITH THE
UNREALITY AND UNTRUTHFULNESS OF POPULAR OPINION AND TELLS MANKIND THAT
THEY MUST BE AND NOT SEEM
HOW ARE THEY TO BE AT ANY RATE THEY MUST
HAVE THE SPIRIT AND DESIRE TO BE
IF THEY ARE IGNORANT THEY MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR IGNORANCE TO THEMSELVES IF THEY ARE CONSCIOUS OF
DOING EVIL THEY MUST LEARN TO DO WELL IF THEY ARE WEAK AND HAVE
NOTHING IN THEM WHICH THEY CAN CALL THEMSELVES THEY MUST ACQUIRE
FIRMNESS AND CONSISTENCY IF THEY ARE INDIFFERENT THEY MUST BEGIN TO
TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE GREAT QUESTIONS WHICH SURROUND THEM
THEY MUST
TRY TO BE WHAT THEY WOULD FAIN APPEAR IN THE EYES OF THEIR FELLOW MEN
A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CANNOT EASILY CHANGE PUBLIC OPINION BUT HE CAN BE
TRUE AND INNOCENT SIMPLE AND INDEPENDENT HE CAN KNOW WHAT HE DOES AND
WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW AND THOUGH NOT WITHOUT AN EFFORT HE CAN FORM
A JUDGMENT OF HIS OWN AT LEAST IN COMMON MATTERS
IN HIS MOST SECRET
ACTIONS HE CAN SHOW THE SAME HIGH PRINCIPLE COMPARE REPUBLIC WHICH HE
SHOWS WHEN SUPPORTED AND WATCHED BY PUBLIC OPINION
AND ON SOME FITTING
OCCASION ON SOME QUESTION OF HUMANITY OR TRUTH OR RIGHT EVEN AN
ORDINARY MAN FROM THE NATURAL RECTITUDE OF HIS DISPOSITION MAY BE
FOUND TO TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST A WHOLE TRIBE OF POLITICIANS AND LAWYERS
AND BE TOO MUCH FOR THEM
WHO IS THE TRUE AND WHO THE FALSE STATESMAN
THE TRUE STATESMAN IS HE WHO BRINGS ORDER OUT OF DISORDER WHO FIRST
ORGANIZES AND THEN ADMINISTERS THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS OWN COUNTRY AND
HAVING MADE A NATION SEEKS TO RECONCILE THE NATIONAL INTERESTS WITH
THOSE OF EUROPE AND OF MANKIND
HE IS NOT A MERE THEORIST NOR YET A
DEALER IN EXPEDIENTS THE WHOLE AND THE PARTS GROW TOGETHER IN HIS MIND
WHILE THE HEAD IS CONCEIVING THE HAND IS EXECUTING
ALTHOUGH OBLIGED TO
DESCEND TO THE WORLD HE IS NOT OF THE WORLD
HIS THOUGHTS ARE FIXED NOT
ON POWER OR RICHES OR EXTENSION OF TERRITORY BUT ON AN IDEAL STATE IN
WHICH ALL THE CITIZENS HAVE AN EQUAL CHANCE OF HEALTH AND LIFE AND
THE HIGHEST EDUCATION IS WITHIN THE REACH OF ALL AND THE MORAL AND
INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL ARE FREELY DEVELOPED AND
'THE IDEA OF GOOD' IS THE ANIMATING PRINCIPLE OF THE WHOLE
NOT THE
ATTAINMENT OF FREEDOM ALONE OR OF ORDER ALONE BUT HOW TO UNITE FREEDOM
WITH ORDER IS THE PROBLEM WHICH HE HAS TO SOLVE
THE STATESMAN WHO PLACES BEFORE HIMSELF THESE LOFTY AIMS HAS UNDERTAKEN
A TASK WHICH WILL CALL FORTH ALL HIS POWERS
HE MUST CONTROL HIMSELF
BEFORE HE CAN CONTROL OTHERS HE MUST KNOW MANKIND BEFORE HE CAN MANAGE
THEM
HE HAS NO PRIVATE LIKES OR DISLIKES HE DOES NOT CONCEAL PERSONAL
ENMITY UNDER THE DISGUISE OF MORAL OR POLITICAL PRINCIPLE SUCH
MEANNESSES INTO WHICH MEN TOO OFTEN FALL UNINTENTIONALLY ARE ABSORBED
IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISSION AND IN HIS LOVE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND
FOR MANKIND
HE WILL SOMETIMES ASK HIMSELF WHAT THE NEXT GENERATION WILL
SAY OF HIM NOT BECAUSE HE IS CAREFUL OF POSTHUMOUS FAME BUT BECAUSE
HE KNOWS THAT THE RESULT OF HIS LIFE AS A WHOLE WILL THEN BE MORE FAIRLY
JUDGED
HE WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF HIS PLANS NOT HURRYING
THEM ON WHEN THE MIND OF A NATION IS UNPREPARED FOR THEM BUT LIKE THE
RULER OF THE UNIVERSE HIMSELF WORKING IN THE APPOINTED TIME FOR
HE KNOWS THAT HUMAN LIFE 'IF NOT LONG IN COMPARISON WITH ETERNITY'
REPUBLIC IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE FULFILMENT OF MANY GREAT PURPOSES
HE
KNOWS TOO THAT THE WORK WILL BE STILL GOING ON WHEN HE IS NO LONGER
HERE AND HE WILL SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN HIS POWERS ARE FAILING
THINK OF THAT OTHER 'CITY OF WHICH THE PATTERN IS IN HEAVEN' REPUBLIC
THE FALSE POLITICIAN IS THE SERVING MAN OF THE STATE
IN ORDER TO GOVERN
MEN HE BECOMES LIKE THEM THEIR 'MINDS ARE MARRIED IN CONJUNCTION THEY
'BEAR THEMSELVES' LIKE VULGAR AND TYRANNICAL MASTERS AND HE IS THEIR
OBEDIENT SERVANT
THE TRUE POLITICIAN IF HE WOULD RULE MEN MUST MAKE
THEM LIKE HIMSELF HE MUST 'EDUCATE HIS PARTY' UNTIL THEY CEASE TO BE
A PARTY HE MUST BREATHE INTO THEM THE SPIRIT WHICH WILL HEREAFTER GIVE
FORM TO THEIR INSTITUTIONS
POLITICS WITH HIM ARE NOT A MECHANISM FOR
SEEMING WHAT HE IS NOT OR FOR CARRYING OUT THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY
HIMSELF A REPRESENTATIVE MAN HE IS THE REPRESENTATIVE NOT OF THE LOWER
BUT OF THE HIGHER ELEMENTS OF THE NATION
THERE IS A BETTER AS WELL AS
A WORSE PUBLIC OPINION OF WHICH HE SEEKS TO LAY HOLD AS THERE IS ALSO
A DEEPER CURRENT OF HUMAN AFFAIRS IN WHICH HE IS BORNE UP WHEN THE WAVES
NEARER THE SHORE ARE THREATENING HIM
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE CANNOT
TAKE THE WORLD BY FORCE TWO OR THREE MOVES ON THE POLITICAL CHESS BOARD
ARE ALL THAT HE CAN FORE SEE TWO OR THREE WEEKS MOVES ON THE POLITICAL
CHESSBOARD ARE ALL THAT HE CAN FORESEE TWO OR THREE WEEKS OR MONTHS ARE
GRANTED TO HIM IN WHICH HE CAN PROVIDE AGAINST A COMING STRUGGLE
BUT
HE KNOWS ALSO THAT THERE ARE PERMANENT PRINCIPLES OF POLITICS WHICH
ARE ALWAYS TENDING TO THE WELL BEING OF STATES BETTER ADMINISTRATION
BETTER EDUCATION THE RECONCILIATION OF CONFLICTING ELEMENTS INCREASED
SECURITY AGAINST EXTERNAL ENEMIES
THESE ARE NOT 'OF TO DAY OR
YESTERDAY BUT ARE THE SAME IN ALL TIMES AND UNDER ALL FORMS OF
GOVERNMENT
THEN WHEN THE STORM DESCENDS AND THE WINDS BLOW THOUGH HE
KNOWS NOT BEFOREHAND THE HOUR OF DANGER THE PILOT NOT LIKE PLATO'S
CAPTAIN IN THE REPUBLIC HALF BLIND AND DEAF BUT WITH PENETRATING EYE
AND QUICK EAR IS READY TO TAKE COMMAND OF THE SHIP AND GUIDE HER INTO
PORT
THE FALSE POLITICIAN ASKS NOT WHAT IS TRUE BUT WHAT IS THE OPINION OF
THE WORLD NOT WHAT IS RIGHT BUT WHAT IS EXPEDIENT
THE ONLY MEASURES
OF WHICH HE APPROVES ARE THE MEASURES WHICH WILL PASS
HE HAS NO
INTENTION OF FIGHTING AN UPHILL BATTLE HE KEEPS THE ROADWAY OF
POLITICS
HE IS UNWILLING TO INCUR THE PERSECUTION AND ENMITY WHICH
POLITICAL CONVICTIONS WOULD ENTAIL UPON HIM
HE BEGINS WITH POPULARITY
AND IN FAIR WEATHER SAILS GALLANTLY ALONG
BUT UNPOPULARITY SOON
FOLLOWS HIM
FOR MEN EXPECT THEIR LEADERS TO BE BETTER AND WISER THAN
THEMSELVES TO BE THEIR GUIDES IN DANGER THEIR SAVIOURS IN EXTREMITY
THEY DO NOT REALLY DESIRE THEM TO OBEY ALL THE IGNORANT IMPULSES OF THE
POPULAR MIND AND IF THEY FAIL THEM IN A CRISIS THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED
THEN AS SOCRATES SAYS THE CRY OF INGRATITUDE IS HEARD WHICH IS MOST
UNREASONABLE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TAUGHT NO BETTER HAVE
DONE WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED OF THEM AND THEIR STATESMEN HAVE RECEIVED
JUSTICE AT THEIR HANDS
THE TRUE STATESMAN IS AWARE THAT HE MUST ADAPT HIMSELF TO TIMES AND
CIRCUMSTANCES
HE MUST HAVE ALLIES IF HE IS TO FIGHT AGAINST THE WORLD
HE MUST ENLIGHTEN PUBLIC OPINION HE MUST ACCUSTOM HIS FOLLOWERS TO
ACT TOGETHER
ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT THE MERE EXECUTOR OF THE WILL OF THE
MAJORITY HE MUST WIN OVER THE MAJORITY TO HIMSELF
HE IS THEIR LEADER
AND NOT THEIR FOLLOWER BUT IN ORDER TO LEAD HE MUST ALSO FOLLOW
HE
WILL NEITHER EXAGGERATE NOR UNDERVALUE THE POWER OF A STATESMAN NEITHER
ADOPTING THE 'LAISSEZ FAIRE' NOR THE 'PATERNAL GOVERNMENT' PRINCIPLE
BUT HE WILL WHETHER HE IS DEALING WITH CHILDREN IN POLITICS OR WITH
FULL GROWN MEN SEEK TO DO FOR THE PEOPLE WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO
FOR THEM AND WHAT FROM IMPERFECT EDUCATION OR DEFICIENT POWERS OF
COMBINATION THEY CANNOT DO FOR THEMSELVES
HE KNOWS THAT IF HE DOES TOO
MUCH FOR THEM THEY WILL DO NOTHING AND THAT IF HE DOES NOTHING FOR THEM
THEY WILL IN SOME STATES OF SOCIETY BE UTTERLY HELPLESS
FOR THE MANY
CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THE FEW IF THE MATERIAL FORCE OF A COUNTRY IS FROM
BELOW WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE ARE FROM ABOVE
IT IS NOT A SMALL PART OF
HUMAN EVILS WHICH KINGS AND GOVERNMENTS MAKE OR CURE
THE STATESMAN IS
WELL AWARE THAT A GREAT PURPOSE CARRIED OUT CONSISTENTLY DURING MANY
YEARS WILL AT LAST BE EXECUTED
HE IS PLAYING FOR A STAKE WHICH MAY BE
PARTLY DETERMINED BY SOME ACCIDENT AND THEREFORE HE WILL ALLOW LARGELY
FOR THE UNKNOWN ELEMENT OF POLITICS
BUT THE GAME BEING ONE IN WHICH
CHANCE AND SKILL ARE COMBINED IF HE PLAYS LONG ENOUGH HE IS CERTAIN OF
VICTORY
HE WILL NOT BE ALWAYS CONSISTENT FOR THE WORLD IS CHANGING
AND THOUGH HE DEPENDS UPON THE SUPPORT OF A PARTY HE WILL REMEMBER THAT
HE IS THE MINISTER OF THE WHOLE
HE LIVES NOT FOR THE PRESENT BUT FOR
THE FUTURE AND HE IS NOT AT ALL SURE THAT HE WILL BE APPRECIATED EITHER
NOW OR THEN
FOR HE MAY HAVE THE EXISTING ORDER OF SOCIETY AGAINST HIM
AND MAY NOT BE REMEMBERED BY A DISTANT POSTERITY
THERE ARE ALWAYS DISCONTENTED IDEALISTS IN POLITICS WHO LIKE SOCRATES
IN THE GORGIAS FIND FAULT WITH ALL STATESMEN PAST AS WELL AS PRESENT
NOT EXCEPTING THE GREATEST NAMES OF HISTORY
MANKIND HAVE AN UNEASY
FEELING THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE BETTER GOVERNED THAN THEY ARE
JUST AS THE
ACTUAL PHILOSOPHER FALLS SHORT OF THE ONE WISE MAN SO DOES THE ACTUAL
STATESMAN FALL SHORT OF THE IDEAL
AND SO PARTLY FROM VANITY AND
EGOTISM BUT PARTLY ALSO FROM A TRUE SENSE OF THE FAULTS OF EMINENT MEN
A TEMPER OF DISSATISFACTION AND CRITICISM SPRINGS UP AMONG THOSE WHO
ARE READY ENOUGH TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE INFERIORITY OF THEIR OWN POWERS
NO
MATTER WHETHER A STATESMAN MAKES HIGH PROFESSIONS OR NONE AT ALL THEY
ARE REDUCED SOONER OR LATER TO THE SAME LEVEL
AND SOMETIMES THE MORE
UNSCRUPULOUS MAN IS BETTER ESTEEMED THAN THE MORE CONSCIENTIOUS BECAUSE
HE HAS NOT EQUALLY DECEIVED EXPECTATIONS
SUCH SENTIMENTS MAY BE UNJUST
BUT THEY ARE WIDELY SPREAD WE CONSTANTLY FIND THEM RECURRING IN REVIEWS
AND NEWSPAPERS AND STILL OFTENER IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION
WE MAY FURTHER OBSERVE THAT THE ART OF GOVERNMENT WHILE IN SOME
RESPECTS TENDING TO IMPROVE HAS IN OTHERS A TENDENCY TO DEGENERATE AS
INSTITUTIONS BECOME MORE POPULAR
GOVERNING FOR THE PEOPLE CANNOT EASILY
BE COMBINED WITH GOVERNING BY THE PEOPLE THE INTERESTS OF CLASSES ARE
TOO STRONG FOR THE IDEAS OF THE STATESMAN WHO TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW
OF THE WHOLE
ACCORDING TO SOCRATES THE TRUE GOVERNOR WILL FIND RUIN OR
DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE AND WILL ONLY BE INDUCED TO GOVERN FROM
THE FEAR OF BEING GOVERNED BY A WORSE MAN THAN HIMSELF REPUBLIC
AND
IN MODERN TIMES THOUGH THE WORLD HAS GROWN MILDER AND THE TERRIBLE
CONSEQUENCES WHICH PLATO FORETELLS NO LONGER AWAIT AN ENGLISH STATESMAN
ANY ONE WHO IS NOT ACTUATED BY A BLIND AMBITION WILL ONLY UNDERTAKE FROM
A SENSE OF DUTY A WORK IN WHICH HE IS MOST LIKELY TO FAIL AND EVEN
IF HE SUCCEED WILL RARELY BE REWARDED BY THE GRATITUDE OF HIS OWN
GENERATION
SOCRATES WHO IS NOT A POLITICIAN AT ALL TELLS US THAT HE IS THE ONLY
REAL POLITICIAN OF HIS TIME
LET US ILLUSTRATE THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS
BY APPLYING THEM TO THE HISTORY OF OUR OWN COUNTRY
HE WOULD HAVE
SAID THAT NOT PITT OR FOX OR CANNING OR SIR R
PEEL ARE THE REAL
POLITICIANS OF THEIR TIME BUT LOCKE HUME ADAM SMITH BENTHAM
RICARDO
THESE DURING THE GREATER PART OF THEIR LIVES OCCUPIED AN
INCONSIDERABLE SPACE IN THE EYES OF THE PUBLIC
THEY WERE PRIVATE
PERSONS NEVERTHELESS THEY SOWED IN THE MINDS OF MEN SEEDS WHICH IN
THE NEXT GENERATION HAVE BECOME AN IRRESISTIBLE POWER
'HEREIN IS THAT
SAYING TRUE ONE SOWETH AND ANOTHER REAPETH WE MAY IMAGINE WITH
PLATO AN IDEAL STATESMAN IN WHOM PRACTICE AND SPECULATION ARE PERFECTLY
HARMONIZED FOR THERE IS NO NECESSARY OPPOSITION BETWEEN THEM
BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THEY ARE COMMONLY DIVORCED THE ORDINARY
POLITICIAN IS THE INTERPRETER OR EXECUTOR OF THE THOUGHTS OF OTHERS AND
HARDLY EVER BRINGS TO THE BIRTH A NEW POLITICAL CONCEPTION
ONE OR TWO
ONLY IN MODERN TIMES LIKE THE ITALIAN STATESMAN CAVOUR HAVE CREATED
THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY MOVED
THE PHILOSOPHER IS NATURALLY UNFITTED FOR
POLITICAL LIFE HIS GREAT IDEAS ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THE MANY HE IS A
THOUSAND MILES AWAY FROM THE QUESTIONS OF THE DAY
YET PERHAPS THE LIVES
OF THINKERS AS THEY ARE STILLER AND DEEPER ARE ALSO HAPPIER THAN THE
LIVES OF THOSE WHO ARE MORE IN THE PUBLIC EYE
THEY HAVE THE PROMISE
OF THE FUTURE THOUGH THEY ARE REGARDED AS DREAMERS AND VISIONARIES BY
THEIR OWN CONTEMPORARIES
AND WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER HERE THOSE WHO
WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED OF THEM DURING THEIR LIVES CLAIM KINDRED WITH
THEM AND ARE PROUD TO BE CALLED BY THEIR NAMES
COMPARE THUCYD
WHO IS THE TRUE POET
PLATO EXPELS THE POETS FROM HIS REPUBLIC BECAUSE THEY ARE ALLIED TO
SENSE BECAUSE THEY STIMULATE THE EMOTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE THRICE
REMOVED FROM THE IDEAL TRUTH
AND IN A SIMILAR SPIRIT HE DECLARES IN THE
GORGIAS THAT THE STATELY MUSE OF TRAGEDY IS A VOTARY OF PLEASURE AND
NOT OF TRUTH
IN MODERN TIMES WE ALMOST RIDICULE THE IDEA OF POETRY
ADMITTING OF A MORAL
THE POET AND THE PROPHET OR PREACHER IN
PRIMITIVE ANTIQUITY ARE ONE AND THE SAME BUT IN LATER AGES THEY SEEM
TO FALL APART
THE GREAT ART OF NOVEL WRITING THAT PECULIAR CREATION
OF OUR OWN AND THE LAST CENTURY WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE SISTER ART
OF REVIEW WRITING THREATENS TO ABSORB ALL LITERATURE HAS EVEN LESS OF
SERIOUSNESS IN HER COMPOSITION
DO WE NOT OFTEN HEAR THE NOVEL WRITER
CENSURED FOR ATTEMPTING TO CONVEY A LESSON TO THE MINDS OF HIS READERS
YET THE TRUE OFFICE OF A POET OR WRITER OF FICTION IS NOT MERELY TO GIVE
AMUSEMENT OR TO BE THE EXPRESSION OF THE FEELINGS OF MANKIND GOOD OR
BAD OR EVEN TO INCREASE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE
THERE HAVE
BEEN POETS IN MODERN TIMES SUCH AS GOETHE OR WORDSWORTH WHO HAVE NOT
FORGOTTEN THEIR HIGH VOCATION OF TEACHERS AND THE TWO GREATEST OF THE
GREEK DRAMATISTS OWE THEIR SUBLIMITY TO THEIR ETHICAL CHARACTER
THE
NOBLEST TRUTHS SUNG OF IN THE PUREST AND SWEETEST LANGUAGE ARE STILL
THE PROPER MATERIAL OF POETRY
THE POET CLOTHES THEM WITH BEAUTY AND
HAS A POWER OF MAKING THEM ENTER INTO THE HEARTS AND MEMORIES OF MEN
HE
HAS NOT ONLY TO SPEAK OF THEMES ABOVE THE LEVEL OF ORDINARY LIFE BUT
TO SPEAK OF THEM IN A DEEPER AND TENDERER WAY THAN THEY ARE ORDINARILY
FELT SO AS TO AWAKEN THE FEELING OF THEM IN OTHERS
THE OLD HE MAKES
YOUNG AGAIN THE FAMILIAR PRINCIPLE HE INVESTS WITH A NEW DIGNITY HE
FINDS A NOBLE EXPRESSION FOR THE COMMON PLACES OF MORALITY AND POLITICS
HE USES THE THINGS OF SENSE SO AS TO INDICATE WHAT IS BEYOND HE RAISES
US THROUGH EARTH TO HEAVEN
HE EXPRESSES WHAT THE BETTER PART OF US
WOULD FAIN SAY AND THE HALF CONSCIOUS FEELING IS STRENGTHENED BY
THE EXPRESSION
HE IS HIS OWN CRITIC FOR THE SPIRIT OF POETRY AND OF
CRITICISM ARE NOT DIVIDED IN HIM
HIS MISSION IS NOT TO DISGUISE MEN
FROM THEMSELVES BUT TO REVEAL TO THEM THEIR OWN NATURE AND MAKE
THEM BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE WORLD AROUND THEM
TRUE POETRY IS THE
REMEMBRANCE OF YOUTH OF LOVE THE EMBODIMENT IN WORDS OF THE HAPPIEST
AND HOLIEST MOMENTS OF LIFE OF THE NOBLEST THOUGHTS OF MAN OF THE
GREATEST DEEDS OF THE PAST
THE POET OF THE FUTURE MAY RETURN TO HIS
GREATER CALLING OF THE PROPHET OR TEACHER INDEED WE HARDLY KNOW WHAT
MAY NOT BE EFFECTED FOR THE HUMAN RACE BY A BETTER USE OF THE POETICAL
AND IMAGINATIVE FACULTY
THE RECONCILIATION OF POETRY AS OF RELIGION
WITH TRUTH MAY STILL BE POSSIBLE
NEITHER IS THE ELEMENT OF PLEASURE
TO BE EXCLUDED
FOR WHEN WE SUBSTITUTE A HIGHER PLEASURE FOR A LOWER WE
RAISE MEN IN THE SCALE OF EXISTENCE
MIGHT NOT THE NOVELIST TOO MAKE
AN IDEAL OR RATHER MANY IDEALS OF SOCIAL LIFE BETTER THAN A THOUSAND
SERMONS PLATO LIKE THE PURITANS IS TOO MUCH AFRAID OF POETIC AND
ARTISTIC INFLUENCES
BUT HE IS NOT WITHOUT A TRUE SENSE OF THE NOBLE
PURPOSES TO WHICH ART MAY BE APPLIED REPUBLIC
MODERN POETRY IS OFTEN A SORT OF PLAYTHING OR IN PLATO'S LANGUAGE A
FLATTERY A SOPHISTRY OR SHAM IN WHICH WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS PURPOSE
THE POET LENDS WINGS TO HIS FANCY AND EXHIBITS HIS GIFTS OF LANGUAGE AND
METRE
SUCH AN ONE SEEKS TO GRATIFY THE TASTE OF HIS READERS HE HAS THE
'SAVOIR FAIRE OR TRICK OF WRITING BUT HE HAS NOT THE HIGHER SPIRIT
OF POETRY
HE HAS NO CONCEPTION THAT TRUE ART SHOULD BRING ORDER OUT OF
DISORDER THAT IT SHOULD MAKE PROVISION FOR THE SOUL'S HIGHEST INTEREST
THAT IT SHOULD BE PURSUED ONLY WITH A VIEW TO 'THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE
CITIZENS HE MINISTERS TO THE WEAKER SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE REPUBLIC
HE IDEALIZES THE SENSUAL HE SINGS THE STRAIN OF LOVE IN THE LATEST
FASHION INSTEAD OF RAISING MEN ABOVE THEMSELVES HE BRINGS THEM BACK TO
THE 'TYRANNY OF THE MANY MASTERS FROM WHICH ALL HIS LIFE LONG A GOOD
MAN HAS BEEN PRAYING TO BE DELIVERED
AND OFTEN FORGETFUL OF MEASURE
AND ORDER HE WILL EXPRESS NOT THAT WHICH IS TRUEST BUT THAT WHICH IS
STRONGEST
INSTEAD OF A GREAT AND NOBLY EXECUTED SUBJECT PERFECT
IN EVERY PART SOME FANCY OF A HEATED BRAIN IS WORKED OUT WITH THE
STRANGEST INCONGRUITY
HE IS NOT THE MASTER OF HIS WORDS BUT HIS
WORDS PERHAPS BORROWED FROM ANOTHER THE FADED REFLECTION OF SOME
FRENCH OR GERMAN OR ITALIAN WRITER HAVE THE BETTER OF HIM
THOUGH
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BANISH THE POETS HOW CAN WE SUPPOSE THAT SUCH
UTTERANCES HAVE ANY HEALING OR LIFE GIVING INFLUENCE ON THE MINDS OF
MEN
'LET US HEAR THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER ART THEN MUST BE TRUE
AND POLITICS MUST BE TRUE AND THE LIFE OF MAN MUST BE TRUE AND NOT A
SEEMING OR SHAM
IN ALL OF THEM ORDER HAS TO BE BROUGHT OUT OF DISORDER
TRUTH OUT OF ERROR AND FALSEHOOD
THIS IS WHAT WE MEAN BY THE GREATEST
IMPROVEMENT OF MAN
AND SO HAVING CONSIDERED IN WHAT WAY 'WE CAN BEST
SPEND THE APPOINTED TIME WE LEAVE THE RESULT WITH GOD PLATO DOES NOT
SAY THAT GOD WILL ORDER ALL THINGS FOR THE BEST COMPARE PHAEDO BUT
HE INDIRECTLY IMPLIES THAT THE EVILS OF THIS LIFE WILL BE CORRECTED
IN ANOTHER
AND AS WE ARE VERY FAR FROM THE BEST IMAGINABLE WORLD AT
PRESENT PLATO HERE AS IN THE PHAEDO AND REPUBLIC SUPPOSES A PURGATORY
OR PLACE OF EDUCATION FOR MANKIND IN GENERAL AND FOR A VERY FEW A
TARTARUS OR HELL
THE MYTH WHICH TERMINATES THE DIALOGUE IS NOT THE
REVELATION BUT RATHER LIKE ALL SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS WHETHER IN THE
BIBLE OR PLATO THE VEIL OF ANOTHER LIFE
FOR NO VISIBLE THING CAN
REVEAL THE INVISIBLE
OF THIS PLATO UNLIKE SOME COMMENTATORS ON
SCRIPTURE IS FULLY AWARE
NEITHER WILL HE DOGMATIZE ABOUT THE MANNER
IN WHICH WE ARE 'BORN AGAIN' REPUBLIC
ONLY HE IS PREPARED TO MAINTAIN
THE ULTIMATE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH AND RIGHT AND DECLARES THAT NO ONE NOT
EVEN THE WISEST OF THE GREEKS CAN AFFIRM ANY OTHER DOCTRINE WITHOUT
BEING RIDICULOUS
THERE IS A FURTHER PARADOX OF ETHICS IN WHICH PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE
HELD TO BE INDIFFERENT AND VIRTUE AT THE TIME OF ACTION AND WITHOUT
REGARD TO CONSEQUENCES IS HAPPINESS
FROM THIS ELEVATION OR EXAGGERATION
OF FEELING PLATO SEEMS TO SHRINK HE LEAVES IT TO THE STOICS IN A LATER
GENERATION TO MAINTAIN THAT WHEN IMPALED OR ON THE RACK THE PHILOSOPHER
MAY BE HAPPY COMPARE REPUBLIC
IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT IN THE REPUBLIC
HE RAISES THIS QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT REALLY DISCUSSED THE VEIL OF THE
IDEAL STATE THE SHADOW OF ANOTHER LIFE ARE ALLOWED TO DESCEND UPON IT
AND IT PASSES OUT OF SIGHT
THE MARTYR OR SUFFERER IN THE CAUSE OF RIGHT
OR TRUTH IS OFTEN SUPPOSED TO DIE IN RAPTURES HAVING HIS EYE FIXED ON A
CITY WHICH IS IN HEAVEN
BUT IF THERE WERE NO FUTURE MIGHT HE NOT STILL
BE HAPPY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ACTION WHICH WAS ATTENDED ONLY BY A
PAINFUL DEATH HE HIMSELF MAY BE READY TO THANK GOD THAT HE WAS THOUGHT
WORTHY TO DO HIM THE LEAST SERVICE WITHOUT LOOKING FOR A REWARD THE
JOYS OF ANOTHER LIFE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN PRESENT TO HIS MIND AT ALL
DO
WE SUPPOSE THAT THE MEDIAEVAL SAINT ST
BERNARD ST
FRANCIS ST
CATHARINE OF SIENNA OR THE CATHOLIC PRIEST WHO LATELY DEVOTED HIMSELF
TO DEATH BY A LINGERING DISEASE THAT HE MIGHT SOLACE AND HELP OTHERS
WAS THINKING OF THE 'SWEETS' OF HEAVEN NO THE WORK WAS ALREADY HEAVEN
TO HIM AND ENOUGH
MUCH LESS WILL THE DYING PATRIOT BE DREAMING OF
THE PRAISES OF MAN OR OF AN IMMORTALITY OF FAME THE SENSE OF DUTY OF
RIGHT AND TRUST IN GOD WILL BE SUFFICIENT AND AS FAR AS THE MIND CAN
REACH IN THAT HOUR
IF HE WERE CERTAIN THAT THERE WERE NO LIFE TO COME
HE WOULD NOT HAVE WISHED TO SPEAK OR ACT OTHERWISE THAN HE DID IN THE
CAUSE OF TRUTH OR OF HUMANITY
NEITHER ON THE OTHER HAND WILL HE
SUPPOSE THAT GOD HAS FORSAKEN HIM OR THAT THE FUTURE IS TO BE A MERE
BLANK TO HIM
THE GREATEST ACT OF FAITH THE ONLY FAITH WHICH CANNOT
PASS AWAY IS HIS WHO HAS NOT KNOWN BUT YET HAS BELIEVED
A VERY FEW
AMONG THE SONS OF MEN HAVE MADE THEMSELVES INDEPENDENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES
PAST PRESENT OR TO COME
HE WHO HAS ATTAINED TO SUCH A TEMPER OF MIND
HAS ALREADY PRESENT WITH HIM ETERNAL LIFE HE NEEDS NO ARGUMENTS TO
CONVINCE HIM OF IMMORTALITY HE HAS IN HIM ALREADY A PRINCIPLE STRONGER
THAN DEATH
HE WHO SERVES MAN WITHOUT THE THOUGHT OF REWARD IS DEEMED
TO BE A MORE FAITHFUL SERVANT THAN HE WHO WORKS FOR HIRE
MAY NOT THE
SERVICE OF GOD WHICH IS THE MORE DISINTERESTED BE IN LIKE MANNER
THE HIGHER AND ALTHOUGH ONLY A VERY FEW IN THE COURSE OF THE WORLD'S
HISTORY CHRIST HIMSELF BEING ONE OF THEM HAVE ATTAINED TO SUCH A NOBLE
CONCEPTION OF GOD AND OF THE HUMAN SOUL YET THE IDEAL OF THEM MAY BE
PRESENT TO US AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEM BE AN EXAMPLE TO US AND
THEIR LIVES MAY SHED A LIGHT ON MANY DARK PLACES BOTH OF PHILOSOPHY AND
THEOLOGY
THE MYTHS OF PLATO
THE MYTHS OF PLATO ARE A PHENOMENON UNIQUE IN LITERATURE
THERE ARE FOUR
LONGER ONES THESE OCCUR IN THE PHAEDRUS PHAEDO GORGIAS AND REPUBLIC
THAT IN THE REPUBLIC IS THE MOST ELABORATE AND FINISHED OF THEM
THREE
OF THESE GREATER MYTHS NAMELY THOSE CONTAINED IN THE PHAEDO THE
GORGIAS AND THE REPUBLIC RELATE TO THE DESTINY OF HUMAN SOULS IN
A FUTURE LIFE
THE MAGNIFICENT MYTH IN THE PHAEDRUS TREATS OF THE
IMMORTALITY OR RATHER THE ETERNITY OF THE SOUL IN WHICH IS INCLUDED
A FORMER AS WELL AS A FUTURE STATE OF EXISTENCE
TO THESE MAY BE ADDED
1 THE MYTH OR RATHER FABLE OCCURRING IN THE STATESMAN IN WHICH THE
LIFE OF INNOCENCE IS CONTRASTED WITH THE ORDINARY LIFE OF MAN AND THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF EVIL 2 THE LEGEND OF THE ISLAND OF ATLANTIS AN
IMAGINARY HISTORY WHICH IS A FRAGMENT ONLY COMMENCED IN THE TIMAEUS
AND CONTINUED IN THE CRITIAS 3 THE MUCH LESS ARTISTIC FICTION OF THE
FOUNDATION OF THE CRETAN COLONY WHICH IS INTRODUCED IN THE PREFACE TO
THE LAWS BUT SOON FALLS INTO THE BACKGROUND 4 THE BEAUTIFUL BUT
RATHER ARTIFICIAL TALE OF PROMETHEUS AND EPIMETHEUS NARRATED IN HIS
RHETORICAL MANNER BY PROTAGORAS IN THE DIALOGUE CALLED AFTER HIM 5
THE SPEECH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PHAEDRUS WHICH IS A PARODY OF THE
ORATOR LYSIAS THE RIVAL SPEECH OF SOCRATES AND THE RECANTATION OF IT
TO THESE MAY BE ADDED 6 THE TALE OF THE GRASSHOPPERS AND 7 THE TALE
OF THAMUS AND OF THEUTH BOTH IN THE PHAEDRUS 8 THE PARABLE OF THE
CAVE REPUBLIC IN WHICH THE PREVIOUS ARGUMENT IS RECAPITULATED AND
THE NATURE AND DEGREES OF KNOWLEDGE HAVING BEEN PREVIOUSLY SET FORTH
IN THE ABSTRACT ARE REPRESENTED IN A PICTURE 9 THE FICTION OF THE
EARTH BORN MEN REPUBLIC COMPARE LAWS IN WHICH BY THE ADAPTATION OF
AN OLD TRADITION PLATO MAKES A NEW BEGINNING FOR HIS SOCIETY 10 THE
MYTH OF ARISTOPHANES RESPECTING THE DIVISION OF THE SEXES SYM 11
THE PARABLE OF THE NOBLE CAPTAIN THE PILOT AND THE MUTINOUS SAILORS
REPUBLIC IN WHICH IS REPRESENTED THE RELATION OF THE BETTER PART OF
THE WORLD AND OF THE PHILOSOPHER TO THE MOB OF POLITICIANS 12 THE
IRONICAL TALE OF THE PILOT WHO PLIES BETWEEN ATHENS AND AEGINA CHARGING
ONLY A SMALL PAYMENT FOR SAVING MEN FROM DEATH THE REASON BEING THAT HE
IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO LIVE OR DIE IS BETTER FOR THEM GOR 13 THE
TREATMENT OF FREEMEN AND CITIZENS BY PHYSICIANS AND OF SLAVES BY
THEIR APPRENTICES A SOMEWHAT LABOURED FIGURE OF SPEECH INTENDED TO
ILLUSTRATE THE TWO DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE LAWS SPEAK TO MEN LAWS
THERE ALSO OCCUR IN PLATO CONTINUOUS IMAGES SOME OF THEM EXTEND OVER
SEVERAL PAGES APPEARING AND REAPPEARING AT INTERVALS SUCH AS THE BEES
STINGING AND STINGLESS PAUPERS AND THIEVES IN THE EIGHTH BOOK OF
THE REPUBLIC WHO ARE GENERATED IN THE TRANSITION FROM TIMOCRACY TO
OLIGARCHY THE SUN WHICH IS TO THE VISIBLE WORLD WHAT THE IDEA OF GOOD
IS TO THE INTELLECTUAL IN THE SIXTH BOOK OF THE REPUBLIC THE COMPOSITE
ANIMAL HAVING THE FORM OF A MAN BUT CONTAINING UNDER A HUMAN SKIN A
LION AND A MANY HEADED MONSTER REPUBLIC THE GREAT BEAST I E
THE
POPULACE AND THE WILD BEAST WITHIN US MEANING THE PASSIONS WHICH ARE
ALWAYS LIABLE TO BREAK OUT THE ANIMATED COMPARISONS OF THE DEGRADATION
OF PHILOSOPHY BY THE ARTS TO THE DISHONOURED MAIDEN AND OF THE TYRANT
TO THE PARRICIDE WHO 'BEATS HIS FATHER HAVING FIRST TAKEN AWAY HIS
ARMS' THE DOG WHO IS YOUR ONLY PHILOSOPHER THE GROTESQUE AND RATHER
PALTRY IMAGE OF THE ARGUMENT WANDERING ABOUT WITHOUT A HEAD LAWS
WHICH IS REPEATED NOT IMPROVED FROM THE GORGIAS THE ARGUMENT
PERSONIFIED AS VEILING HER FACE REPUBLIC AS ENGAGED IN A CHASE AS
BREAKING UPON US IN A FIRST SECOND AND THIRD WAVE ON THESE FIGURES
OF SPEECH THE CHANGES ARE RUNG MANY TIMES OVER
IT IS OBSERVABLE
THAT NEARLY ALL THESE PARABLES OR CONTINUOUS IMAGES ARE FOUND IN THE
REPUBLIC THAT WHICH OCCURS IN THE THEAETETUS OF THE MIDWIFERY OF
SOCRATES IS PERHAPS THE ONLY EXCEPTION
TO MAKE THE LIST COMPLETE
THE MATHEMATICAL FIGURE OF THE NUMBER OF THE STATE REPUBLIC OR THE
NUMERICAL INTERVAL WHICH SEPARATES KING FROM TYRANT SHOULD NOT BE
FORGOTTEN
THE MYTH IN THE GORGIAS IS ONE OF THOSE DESCRIPTIONS OF ANOTHER LIFE
WHICH LIKE THE SIXTH AENEID OF VIRGIL APPEAR TO CONTAIN REMINISCENCES
OF THE MYSTERIES
IT IS A VISION OF THE REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS WHICH
AWAIT GOOD AND BAD MEN AFTER DEATH
IT SUPPOSES THE BODY TO CONTINUE
AND TO BE IN ANOTHER WORLD WHAT IT HAS BECOME IN THIS
IT INCLUDES A
PARADISO PURGATORIO AND INFERNO LIKE THE SISTER MYTHS OF THE PHAEDO
AND THE REPUBLIC
THE INFERNO IS RESERVED FOR GREAT CRIMINALS ONLY
THE ARGUMENT OF THE DIALOGUE IS FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AND THE MEANING
BREAKS THROUGH SO AS RATHER TO DESTROY THE LIVELINESS AND CONSISTENCY
OF THE PICTURE
THE STRUCTURE OF THE FICTION IS VERY SLIGHT THE CHIEF
POINT OR MORAL BEING THAT IN THE JUDGMENTS OF ANOTHER WORLD THERE IS
NO POSSIBILITY OF CONCEALMENT ZEUS HAS TAKEN FROM MEN THE POWER OF
FORESEEING DEATH AND BRINGS TOGETHER THE SOULS BOTH OF THEM AND THEIR
JUDGES NAKED AND UNDISGUISED AT THE JUDGMENT SEAT
BOTH ARE EXPOSED TO
VIEW STRIPPED OF THE VEILS AND CLOTHES WHICH MIGHT PREVENT THEM FROM
SEEING INTO OR BEING SEEN BY ONE ANOTHER
THE MYTH OF THE PHAEDO IS OF THE SAME TYPE BUT IT IS MORE COSMOLOGICAL
AND ALSO MORE POETICAL
THE BEAUTIFUL AND INGENIOUS FANCY OCCURS
TO PLATO THAT THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE IS AN EARTH AND HEAVEN IN ONE A
GLORIFIED EARTH FAIRER AND PURER THAN THAT IN WHICH WE DWELL
AS THE
FISHES LIVE IN THE OCEAN MANKIND ARE LIVING IN A LOWER SPHERE OUT
OF WHICH THEY PUT THEIR HEADS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO AND BEHOLD A WORLD
BEYOND
THE EARTH WHICH WE INHABIT IS A SEDIMENT OF THE COARSER
PARTICLES WHICH DROP FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND IS TO THAT HEAVENLY EARTH
WHAT THE DESERT AND THE SHORES OF THE OCEAN ARE TO US
A PART OF THE
MYTH CONSISTS OF DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH WHICH
GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING SEVERAL MYTHOLOGICAL NAMES AND
OF PROVIDING PLACES OF TORMENT FOR THE WICKED
THERE IS NO CLEAR
DISTINCTION OF SOUL AND BODY THE SPIRITS BENEATH THE EARTH ARE SPOKEN
OF AS SOULS ONLY YET THEY RETAIN A SORT OF SHADOWY FORM WHEN THEY CRY
FOR MERCY ON THE SHORES OF THE LAKE AND THE PHILOSOPHER ALONE IS SAID
TO HAVE GOT RID OF THE BODY
ALL THE THREE MYTHS IN PLATO WHICH RELATE
TO THE WORLD BELOW HAVE A PLACE FOR REPENTANT SINNERS AS WELL AS
OTHER HOMES OR PLACES FOR THE VERY GOOD AND VERY BAD
IT IS A NATURAL
REFLECTION WHICH IS MADE BY PLATO ELSEWHERE THAT THE TWO EXTREMES OF
HUMAN CHARACTER ARE RARELY MET WITH AND THAT THE GENERALITY OF MANKIND
ARE BETWEEN THEM
HENCE A PLACE MUST BE FOUND FOR THEM
IN THE MYTH OF
THE PHAEDO THEY ARE CARRIED DOWN THE RIVER ACHERON TO THE ACHERUSIAN
LAKE WHERE THEY DWELL AND ARE PURIFIED OF THEIR EVIL DEEDS AND
RECEIVE THE REWARDS OF THEIR GOOD
THERE ARE ALSO INCURABLE SINNERS
WHO ARE CAST INTO TARTARUS THERE TO REMAIN AS THE PENALTY OF ATROCIOUS
CRIMES THESE SUFFER EVERLASTINGLY
AND THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS OF
HARDLY CURABLE SINNERS WHO ARE ALLOWED FROM TIME TO TIME TO APPROACH
THE SHORES OF THE ACHERUSIAN LAKE WHERE THEY CRY TO THEIR VICTIMS FOR
MERCY WHICH IF THEY OBTAIN THEY COME OUT INTO THE LAKE AND CEASE FROM
THEIR TORMENTS
NEITHER THIS NOR ANY OF THE THREE GREATER MYTHS OF PLATO NOR PERHAPS
ANY ALLEGORY OR PARABLE RELATING TO THE UNSEEN WORLD IS CONSISTENT
WITH ITSELF
THE LANGUAGE OF PHILOSOPHY MINGLES WITH THAT OF MYTHOLOGY
ABSTRACT IDEAS ARE TRANSFORMED INTO PERSONS FIGURES OF SPEECH INTO
REALITIES
THESE MYTHS MAY BE COMPARED WITH THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS OF
BUNYAN IN WHICH DISCUSSIONS OF THEOLOGY ARE MIXED UP WITH THE INCIDENTS
OF TRAVEL AND MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN BEINGS
THEY ARE ALSO GARNISHED WITH NAMES AND PHRASES TAKEN OUT OF HOMER AND
WITH OTHER FRAGMENTS OF GREEK TRADITION
THE MYTH OF THE REPUBLIC IS MORE SUBTLE AND ALSO MORE CONSISTENT THAN
EITHER OF THE TWO OTHERS
IT HAS A GREATER VERISIMILITUDE THAN THEY
HAVE AND IS FULL OF TOUCHES WHICH RECALL THE EXPERIENCES OF HUMAN LIFE
IT WILL BE NOTICED BY AN ATTENTIVE READER THAT THE TWELVE DAYS DURING
WHICH ER LAY IN A TRANCE AFTER HE WAS SLAIN COINCIDE WITH THE TIME
PASSED BY THE SPIRITS IN THEIR PILGRIMAGE
IT IS A CURIOUS OBSERVATION
NOT OFTEN MADE THAT GOOD MEN WHO HAVE LIVED IN A WELL GOVERNED CITY
SHALL WE SAY IN A RELIGIOUS AND RESPECTABLE SOCIETY ARE MORE LIKELY
TO MAKE MISTAKES IN THEIR CHOICE OF LIFE THAN THOSE WHO HAVE HAD MORE
EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD AND OF EVIL
IT IS A MORE FAMILIAR REMARK THAT
WE CONSTANTLY BLAME OTHERS WHEN WE HAVE ONLY OURSELVES TO BLAME AND
THE PHILOSOPHER MUST ACKNOWLEDGE HOWEVER RELUCTANTLY THAT THERE IS AN
ELEMENT OF CHANCE IN HUMAN LIFE WITH WHICH IT IS SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE
FOR MAN TO COPE
THAT MEN DRINK MORE OF THE WATERS OF FORGETFULNESS THAN
IS GOOD FOR THEM IS A POETICAL DESCRIPTION OF A FAMILIAR TRUTH
WE HAVE
MANY OF US KNOWN MEN WHO LIKE ODYSSEUS HAVE WEARIED OF AMBITION
AND HAVE ONLY DESIRED REST
WE SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THE
INFANTS 'DYING ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY WERE BORN BUT PLATO ONLY RAISES
WITHOUT SATISFYING OUR CURIOSITY
THE TWO COMPANIES OF SOULS ASCENDING
AND DESCENDING AT EITHER CHASM OF HEAVEN AND EARTH AND CONVERSING
WHEN THEY COME OUT INTO THE MEADOW THE MAJESTIC FIGURES OF THE JUDGES
SITTING IN HEAVEN THE VOICE HEARD BY ARDIAEUS ARE FEATURES OF THE
GREAT ALLEGORY WHICH HAVE AN INDESCRIBABLE GRANDEUR AND POWER
THE
REMARK ALREADY MADE RESPECTING THE INCONSISTENCY OF THE TWO OTHER MYTHS
MUST BE EXTENDED ALSO TO THIS IT IS AT ONCE AN ORRERY OR MODEL OF THE
HEAVENS AND A PICTURE OF THE DAY OF JUDGMENT
THE THREE MYTHS ARE UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN PLATO
THERE IS AN ORIENTAL
OR RATHER AN EGYPTIAN ELEMENT IN THEM AND THEY HAVE AN AFFINITY TO THE
MYSTERIES AND TO THE ORPHIC MODES OF WORSHIP
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THEY
ARE UN GREEK AT ANY RATE THERE IS HARDLY ANYTHING LIKE THEM IN
OTHER GREEK WRITINGS WHICH HAVE A SERIOUS PURPOSE IN SPIRIT THEY ARE
MEDIAEVAL
THEY ARE AKIN TO WHAT MAY BE TERMED THE UNDERGROUND RELIGION
IN ALL AGES AND COUNTRIES
THEY ARE PRESENTED IN THE MOST LIVELY AND
GRAPHIC MANNER BUT THEY ARE NEVER INSISTED ON AS TRUE IT IS ONLY
AFFIRMED THAT NOTHING BETTER CAN BE SAID ABOUT A FUTURE LIFE
PLATO
SEEMS TO MAKE USE OF THEM WHEN HE HAS REACHED THE LIMITS OF HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE OR TO BORROW AN EXPRESSION OF HIS OWN WHEN HE IS STANDING
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE INTELLECTUAL WORLD
THEY ARE VERY SIMPLE IN STYLE
A FEW TOUCHES BRING THE PICTURE HOME TO THE MIND AND MAKE IT PRESENT
TO US
THEY HAVE ALSO A KIND OF AUTHORITY GAINED BY THE EMPLOYMENT
OF SACRED AND FAMILIAR NAMES JUST AS MERE FRAGMENTS OF THE WORDS OF
SCRIPTURE PUT TOGETHER IN ANY FORM AND APPLIED TO ANY SUBJECT HAVE A
POWER OF THEIR OWN
THEY ARE A SUBSTITUTE FOR POETRY AND MYTHOLOGY AND
THEY ARE ALSO A REFORM OF MYTHOLOGY
THE MORAL OF THEM MAY BE SUMMED UP
IN A WORD OR TWO AFTER DEATH THE JUDGMENT AND 'THERE IS SOME BETTER
THING REMAINING FOR THE GOOD THAN FOR THE EVIL
ALL LITERATURE GATHERS INTO ITSELF MANY ELEMENTS OF THE PAST FOR
EXAMPLE THE TALE OF THE EARTH BORN MEN IN THE REPUBLIC APPEARS AT FIRST
SIGHT TO BE AN EXTRAVAGANT FANCY BUT IT IS RESTORED TO PROPRIETY WHEN
WE REMEMBER THAT IT IS BASED ON A LEGENDARY BELIEF
THE ART OF MAKING
STORIES OF GHOSTS AND APPARITIONS CREDIBLE IS SAID TO CONSIST IN THE
MANNER OF TELLING THEM
THE EFFECT IS GAINED BY MANY LITERARY AND
CONVERSATIONAL DEVICES SUCH AS THE PREVIOUS RAISING OF CURIOSITY
THE MENTION OF LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCES SIMPLICITY PICTURESQUENESS THE
NATURALNESS OF THE OCCASION AND THE LIKE
THIS ART IS POSSESSED BY
PLATO IN A DEGREE WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN EQUALLED
THE MYTH IN THE PHAEDRUS IS EVEN GREATER THAN THE MYTHS WHICH HAVE
BEEN ALREADY DESCRIBED BUT IS OF A DIFFERENT CHARACTER
IT TREATS OF
A FORMER RATHER THAN OF A FUTURE LIFE
IT REPRESENTS THE CONFLICT OF
REASON AIDED BY PASSION OR RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION ON THE ONE HAND AND
OF THE ANIMAL LUSTS AND INSTINCTS ON THE OTHER
THE SOUL OF MAN HAS
FOLLOWED THE COMPANY OF SOME GOD AND SEEN TRUTH IN THE FORM OF THE
UNIVERSAL BEFORE IT WAS BORN IN THIS WORLD
OUR PRESENT LIFE IS THE
RESULT OF THE STRUGGLE WHICH WAS THEN CARRIED ON
THIS WORLD IS RELATIVE
TO A FORMER WORLD AS IT IS OFTEN PROJECTED INTO A FUTURE
WE ASK THE
QUESTION WHERE WERE MEN BEFORE BIRTH AS WE LIKEWISE ENQUIRE WHAT WILL
BECOME OF THEM AFTER DEATH THE FIRST QUESTION IS UNFAMILIAR TO US AND
THEREFORE SEEMS TO BE UNNATURAL BUT IF WE SURVEY THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE
IT HAS BEEN AS INFLUENTIAL AND AS WIDELY SPREAD AS THE OTHER
IN THE
PHAEDRUS IT IS REALLY A FIGURE OF SPEECH IN WHICH THE 'SPIRITUAL
COMBAT' OF THIS LIFE IS REPRESENTED
THE MAJESTY AND POWER OF THE WHOLE
PASSAGE ESPECIALLY OF WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE THEME OR PROEM BEGINNING
'THE MIND THROUGH ALL HER BEING IS IMMORTAL' CAN ONLY BE RENDERED VERY
INADEQUATELY IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE
THE MYTH IN THE STATESMAN RELATES TO A FORMER CYCLE OF EXISTENCE IN
WHICH MEN WERE BORN OF THE EARTH AND BY THE REVERSAL OF THE EARTH'S
MOTION HAD THEIR LIVES REVERSED AND WERE RESTORED TO YOUTH AND BEAUTY
THE DEAD CAME TO LIFE THE OLD GREW MIDDLE AGED AND THE MIDDLE AGED
YOUNG THE YOUTH BECAME A CHILD THE CHILD AN INFANT THE INFANT
VANISHED INTO THE EARTH
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE REVERSAL OF THE
EARTH'S MOTION AND THE REVERSAL OF HUMAN LIFE IS OF COURSE VERBAL ONLY
YET PLATO LIKE THEOLOGIANS IN OTHER AGES ARGUES FROM THE CONSISTENCY
OF THE TALE TO ITS TRUTH
THE NEW ORDER OF THE WORLD WAS IMMEDIATELY
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD IT WAS A STATE OF INNOCENCE IN WHICH MEN
HAD NEITHER WANTS NOR CARES IN WHICH THE EARTH BROUGHT FORTH ALL THINGS
SPONTANEOUSLY AND GOD WAS TO MAN WHAT MAN NOW IS TO THE ANIMALS
THERE
WERE NO GREAT ESTATES OR FAMILIES OR PRIVATE POSSESSIONS NOR ANY
TRADITIONS OF THE PAST BECAUSE MEN WERE ALL BORN OUT OF THE EARTH
THIS IS WHAT PLATO CALLS THE 'REIGN OF CRONOS AND IN LIKE MANNER HE
CONNECTS THE REVERSAL OF THE EARTH'S MOTION WITH SOME LEGEND OF WHICH HE
HIMSELF WAS PROBABLY THE INVENTOR
THE QUESTION IS THEN ASKED UNDER WHICH OF THESE TWO CYCLES OF EXISTENCE
WAS MAN THE HAPPIER UNDER THAT OF CRONOS WHICH WAS A STATE OF
INNOCENCE OR THAT OF ZEUS WHICH IS OUR ORDINARY LIFE FOR A WHILE
PLATO BALANCES THE TWO SIDES OF THE SERIOUS CONTROVERSY WHICH HE HAS
SUGGESTED IN A FIGURE
THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON ANOTHER QUESTION WHAT
USE DID THE CHILDREN OF CRONOS MAKE OF THEIR TIME THEY HAD BOUNDLESS
LEISURE AND THE FACULTY OF DISCOURSING NOT ONLY WITH ONE ANOTHER
BUT WITH THE ANIMALS
DID THEY EMPLOY THESE ADVANTAGES WITH A VIEW TO
PHILOSOPHY GATHERING FROM EVERY NATURE SOME ADDITION TO THEIR STORE
OF KNOWLEDGE OR DID THEY PASS THEIR TIME IN EATING AND DRINKING AND
TELLING STORIES TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE BEASTS IN EITHER CASE
THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN ANSWERING
BUT THEN AS PLATO RATHER
MISCHIEVOUSLY ADDS 'NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY DID AND THEREFORE THE
DOUBT MUST REMAIN UNDETERMINED
TO THE FIRST THERE SUCCEEDS A SECOND EPOCH
AFTER ANOTHER NATURAL
CONVULSION IN WHICH THE ORDER OF THE WORLD AND OF HUMAN LIFE IS ONCE
MORE REVERSED GOD WITHDRAWS HIS GUIDING HAND AND MAN IS LEFT TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF HIMSELF
THE WORLD BEGINS AGAIN AND ARTS AND LAWS ARE
SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY INVENTED
A SECULAR AGE SUCCEEDS TO A THEOCRATICAL
IN THIS FANCIFUL TALE PLATO HAS DROPPED OR ALMOST DROPPED THE GARB OF
MYTHOLOGY
HE SUGGESTS SEVERAL CURIOUS AND IMPORTANT THOUGHTS SUCH
AS THE POSSIBILITY OF A STATE OF INNOCENCE THE EXISTENCE OF A WORLD
WITHOUT TRADITIONS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMAN AND DIVINE
GOVERNMENT
HE HAS ALSO CARRIED A STEP FURTHER HIS SPECULATIONS
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE FAMILY AND OF PROPERTY WHICH HE
SUPPOSES TO HAVE NO PLACE AMONG THE CHILDREN OF CRONOS ANY MORE THAN IN
THE IDEAL STATE
IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF PLATO AND OF HIS AGE TO PASS FROM THE ABSTRACT
TO THE CONCRETE FROM POETRY TO REALITY
LANGUAGE IS THE EXPRESSION OF
THE SEEN AND ALSO OF THE UNSEEN AND MOVES IN A REGION BETWEEN THEM
A
GREAT WRITER KNOWS HOW TO STRIKE BOTH THESE CHORDS SOMETIMES REMAINING
WITHIN THE SPHERE OF THE VISIBLE AND THEN AGAIN COMPREHENDING A WIDER
RANGE AND SOARING TO THE ABSTRACT AND UNIVERSAL
EVEN IN THE SAME
SENTENCE HE MAY EMPLOY BOTH MODES OF SPEECH NOT IMPROPERLY OR
INHARMONIOUSLY
IT IS USELESS TO CRITICISE THE BROKEN METAPHORS OF
PLATO IF THE EFFECT OF THE WHOLE IS TO CREATE A PICTURE NOT SUCH AS
CAN BE PAINTED ON CANVAS BUT WHICH IS FULL OF LIFE AND MEANING TO THE
READER
A POEM MAY BE CONTAINED IN A WORD OR TWO WHICH MAY CALL UP NOT
ONE BUT MANY LATENT IMAGES OR HALF REVEAL TO US BY A SUDDEN FLASH THE
THOUGHTS OF MANY HEARTS
OFTEN THE RAPID TRANSITION FROM ONE IMAGE
TO ANOTHER IS PLEASING TO US ON THE OTHER HAND ANY SINGLE FIGURE OF
SPEECH IF TOO OFTEN REPEATED OR WORKED OUT TOO MUCH AT LENGTH BECOMES
PROSY AND MONOTONOUS
IN THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY WE NECESSARILY INCLUDE
BOTH 'THE MORAL LAW WITHIN AND THE STARRY HEAVEN ABOVE AND PASS FROM
ONE TO THE OTHER COMPARE FOR EXAMPLES PSALMS XVIII
AND XIX
WHETHER
SUCH A USE OF LANGUAGE IS PUERILE OR NOBLE DEPENDS UPON THE GENIUS OF
THE WRITER OR SPEAKER AND THE FAMILIARITY OF THE ASSOCIATIONS EMPLOYED
IN THE MYTHS AND PARABLES OF PLATO THE EASE AND GRACE OF CONVERSATION
IS NOT FORGOTTEN THEY ARE SPOKEN NOT WRITTEN WORDS STORIES WHICH
ARE TOLD TO A LIVING AUDIENCE AND SO WELL TOLD THAT WE ARE MORE THAN
HALF INCLINED TO BELIEVE THEM COMPARE PHAEDRUS
AS IN CONVERSATION
TOO THE STRIKING IMAGE OR FIGURE OF SPEECH IS NOT FORGOTTEN BUT IS
QUICKLY CAUGHT UP AND ALLUDED TO AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IT WOULD STILL BE
IN OUR OWN DAY IN A GENIAL AND SYMPATHETIC SOCIETY
THE DESCRIPTIONS OF
PLATO HAVE A GREATER LIFE AND REALITY THAN IS TO BE FOUND IN ANY MODERN
WRITING
THIS IS DUE TO THEIR HOMELINESS AND SIMPLICITY
PLATO CAN DO
WITH WORDS JUST AS HE PLEASES TO HIM THEY ARE INDEED 'MORE PLASTIC THAN
WAX' REPUBLIC
WE ARE IN THE HABIT OF OPPOSING SPEECH AND WRITING
POETRY AND PROSE
BUT HE HAS DISCOVERED A USE OF LANGUAGE IN WHICH THEY
ARE UNITED WHICH GIVES A FITTING EXPRESSION TO THE HIGHEST TRUTHS AND
IN WHICH THE TRIFLES OF COURTESY AND THE FAMILIARITIES OF DAILY LIFE ARE
NOT OVERLOOKED

PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE CALLICLES SOCRATES CHAEREPHON GORGIAS
POLUS
SCENE THE HOUSE OF CALLICLES
CALLICLES THE WISE MAN AS THE PROVERB SAYS IS LATE FOR A FRAY BUT
NOT FOR A FEAST
SOCRATES AND ARE WE LATE FOR A FEAST
CALLICLES YES AND A DELIGHTFUL FEAST FOR GORGIAS HAS JUST BEEN
EXHIBITING TO US MANY FINE THINGS
SOCRATES IT IS NOT MY FAULT CALLICLES OUR FRIEND CHAEREPHON IS TO
BLAME FOR HE WOULD KEEP US LOITERING IN THE AGORA
CHAEREPHON NEVER MIND SOCRATES THE MISFORTUNE OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN
THE CAUSE I WILL ALSO REPAIR FOR GORGIAS IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND I
WILL MAKE HIM GIVE THE EXHIBITION AGAIN EITHER NOW OR IF YOU PREFER
AT SOME OTHER TIME
CALLICLES WHAT IS THE MATTER CHAEREPHON DOES SOCRATES WANT TO HEAR
GORGIAS
CHAEREPHON YES THAT WAS OUR INTENTION IN COMING
CALLICLES COME INTO MY HOUSE THEN FOR GORGIAS IS STAYING WITH ME AND
HE SHALL EXHIBIT TO YOU
SOCRATES VERY GOOD CALLICLES BUT WILL HE ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS FOR
I WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM WHAT IS THE NATURE OF HIS ART AND WHAT IT IS
WHICH HE PROFESSES AND TEACHES HE MAY AS YOU CHAEREPHON SUGGEST
DEFER THE EXHIBITION TO SOME OTHER TIME
CALLICLES THERE IS NOTHING LIKE ASKING HIM SOCRATES AND INDEED TO
ANSWER QUESTIONS IS A PART OF HIS EXHIBITION FOR HE WAS SAYING ONLY
JUST NOW THAT ANY ONE IN MY HOUSE MIGHT PUT ANY QUESTION TO HIM AND
THAT HE WOULD ANSWER
SOCRATES HOW FORTUNATE WILL YOU ASK HIM CHAEREPHON
CHAEREPHON WHAT SHALL I ASK HIM
SOCRATES ASK HIM WHO HE IS
CHAEREPHON WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SOCRATES I MEAN SUCH A QUESTION AS WOULD ELICIT FROM HIM IF HE
HAD BEEN A MAKER OF SHOES THE ANSWER THAT HE IS A COBBLER
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND
CHAEREPHON I UNDERSTAND AND WILL ASK HIM TELL ME GORGIAS IS OUR
FRIEND CALLICLES RIGHT IN SAYING THAT YOU UNDERTAKE TO ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS WHICH YOU ARE ASKED
GORGIAS QUITE RIGHT CHAEREPHON I WAS SAYING AS MUCH ONLY JUST NOW
AND I MAY ADD THAT MANY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE ANY ONE HAS ASKED ME A
NEW ONE
CHAEREPHON THEN YOU MUST BE VERY READY GORGIAS
GORGIAS OF THAT CHAEREPHON YOU CAN MAKE TRIAL
POLUS YES INDEED AND IF YOU LIKE CHAEREPHON YOU MAY MAKE TRIAL OF
ME TOO FOR I THINK THAT GORGIAS WHO HAS BEEN TALKING A LONG TIME IS
TIRED
CHAEREPHON AND DO YOU POLUS THINK THAT YOU CAN ANSWER BETTER THAN
GORGIAS
POLUS WHAT DOES THAT MATTER IF I ANSWER WELL ENOUGH FOR YOU
CHAEREPHON NOT AT ALL AND YOU SHALL ANSWER IF YOU LIKE
POLUS ASK
CHAEREPHON MY QUESTION IS THIS IF GORGIAS HAD THE SKILL OF HIS BROTHER
HERODICUS WHAT OUGHT WE TO CALL HIM OUGHT HE NOT TO HAVE THE NAME
WHICH IS GIVEN TO HIS BROTHER
POLUS CERTAINLY
CHAEREPHON THEN WE SHOULD BE RIGHT IN CALLING HIM A PHYSICIAN
POLUS YES
CHAEREPHON AND IF HE HAD THE SKILL OF ARISTOPHON THE SON OF AGLAOPHON
OR OF HIS BROTHER POLYGNOTUS WHAT OUGHT WE TO CALL HIM
POLUS CLEARLY A PAINTER
CHAEREPHON BUT NOW WHAT SHALL WE CALL HIM WHAT IS THE ART IN WHICH HE
IS SKILLED
POLUS O CHAEREPHON THERE ARE MANY ARTS AMONG MANKIND WHICH ARE
EXPERIMENTAL AND HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN EXPERIENCE FOR EXPERIENCE MAKES
THE DAYS OF MEN TO PROCEED ACCORDING TO ART AND INEXPERIENCE ACCORDING
TO CHANCE AND DIFFERENT PERSONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS ARE PROFICIENT IN
DIFFERENT ARTS AND THE BEST PERSONS IN THE BEST ARTS
AND OUR FRIEND
GORGIAS IS ONE OF THE BEST AND THE ART IN WHICH HE IS A PROFICIENT IS
THE NOBLEST
SOCRATES POLUS HAS BEEN TAUGHT HOW TO MAKE A CAPITAL SPEECH GORGIAS
BUT HE IS NOT FULFILLING THE PROMISE WHICH HE MADE TO CHAEREPHON
GORGIAS WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOCRATES
SOCRATES I MEAN THAT HE HAS NOT EXACTLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHICH HE
WAS ASKED
GORGIAS THEN WHY NOT ASK HIM YOURSELF
SOCRATES BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER ASK YOU IF YOU ARE DISPOSED TO
ANSWER FOR I SEE FROM THE FEW WORDS WHICH POLUS HAS UTTERED THAT HE
HAS ATTENDED MORE TO THE ART WHICH IS CALLED RHETORIC THAN TO DIALECTIC
POLUS WHAT MAKES YOU SAY SO SOCRATES
SOCRATES BECAUSE POLUS WHEN CHAEREPHON ASKED YOU WHAT WAS THE ART
WHICH GORGIAS KNOWS YOU PRAISED IT AS IF YOU WERE ANSWERING SOME ONE
WHO FOUND FAULT WITH IT BUT YOU NEVER SAID WHAT THE ART WAS
POLUS WHY DID I NOT SAY THAT IT WAS THE NOBLEST OF ARTS
SOCRATES YES INDEED BUT THAT WAS NO ANSWER TO THE QUESTION NOBODY
ASKED WHAT WAS THE QUALITY BUT WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE ART AND BY
WHAT NAME WE WERE TO DESCRIBE GORGIAS
AND I WOULD STILL BEG YOU BRIEFLY
AND CLEARLY AS YOU ANSWERED CHAEREPHON WHEN HE ASKED YOU AT FIRST
TO SAY WHAT THIS ART IS AND WHAT WE OUGHT TO CALL GORGIAS OR RATHER
GORGIAS LET ME TURN TO YOU AND ASK THE SAME QUESTION WHAT ARE WE TO
CALL YOU AND WHAT IS THE ART WHICH YOU PROFESS
GORGIAS RHETORIC SOCRATES IS MY ART
SOCRATES THEN I AM TO CALL YOU A RHETORICIAN
GORGIAS YES SOCRATES AND A GOOD ONE TOO IF YOU WOULD CALL ME THAT
WHICH IN HOMERIC LANGUAGE 'I BOAST MYSELF TO BE
SOCRATES I SHOULD WISH TO DO SO
GORGIAS THEN PRAY DO
SOCRATES AND ARE WE TO SAY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO MAKE OTHER MEN
RHETORICIANS
GORGIAS YES THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I PROFESS TO MAKE THEM NOT ONLY AT
ATHENS BUT IN ALL PLACES
SOCRATES AND WILL YOU CONTINUE TO ASK AND ANSWER QUESTIONS GORGIAS
AS WE ARE AT PRESENT DOING AND RESERVE FOR ANOTHER OCCASION THE LONGER
MODE OF SPEECH WHICH POLUS WAS ATTEMPTING WILL YOU KEEP YOUR PROMISE
AND ANSWER SHORTLY THE QUESTIONS WHICH ARE ASKED OF YOU
GORGIAS SOME ANSWERS SOCRATES ARE OF NECESSITY LONGER BUT I WILL DO
MY BEST TO MAKE THEM AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE FOR A PART OF MY PROFESSION
IS THAT I CAN BE AS SHORT AS ANY ONE
SOCRATES THAT IS WHAT IS WANTED GORGIAS EXHIBIT THE SHORTER METHOD
NOW AND THE LONGER ONE AT SOME OTHER TIME
GORGIAS WELL I WILL AND YOU WILL CERTAINLY SAY THAT YOU NEVER HEARD
A MAN USE FEWER WORDS
SOCRATES VERY GOOD THEN AS YOU PROFESS TO BE A RHETORICIAN AND A
MAKER OF RHETORICIANS LET ME ASK YOU WITH WHAT IS RHETORIC CONCERNED
I MIGHT ASK WITH WHAT IS WEAVING CONCERNED AND YOU WOULD REPLY WOULD
YOU NOT WITH THE MAKING OF GARMENTS
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND MUSIC IS CONCERNED WITH THE COMPOSITION OF MELODIES
GORGIAS IT IS
SOCRATES BY HERE GORGIAS I ADMIRE THE SURPASSING BREVITY OF YOUR
ANSWERS
GORGIAS YES SOCRATES I DO THINK MYSELF GOOD AT THAT
SOCRATES I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT ANSWER ME IN LIKE MANNER ABOUT RHETORIC
WITH WHAT IS RHETORIC CONCERNED
GORGIAS WITH DISCOURSE
SOCRATES WHAT SORT OF DISCOURSE GORGIAS SUCH DISCOURSE AS WOULD
TEACH THE SICK UNDER WHAT TREATMENT THEY MIGHT GET WELL
GORGIAS NO
SOCRATES THEN RHETORIC DOES NOT TREAT OF ALL KINDS OF DISCOURSE
GORGIAS CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES AND YET RHETORIC MAKES MEN ABLE TO SPEAK
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT ABOUT WHICH THEY SPEAK
GORGIAS OF COURSE
SOCRATES BUT DOES NOT THE ART OF MEDICINE WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW
MENTIONING ALSO MAKE MEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND AND SPEAK ABOUT THE SICK
GORGIAS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THEN MEDICINE ALSO TREATS OF DISCOURSE
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES OF DISCOURSE CONCERNING DISEASES
GORGIAS JUST SO
SOCRATES AND DOES NOT GYMNASTIC ALSO TREAT OF DISCOURSE CONCERNING THE
GOOD OR EVIL CONDITION OF THE BODY
GORGIAS VERY TRUE
SOCRATES AND THE SAME GORGIAS IS TRUE OF THE OTHER ARTS ALL OF THEM
TREAT OF DISCOURSE CONCERNING THE SUBJECTS WITH WHICH THEY SEVERALLY
HAVE TO DO
GORGIAS CLEARLY
SOCRATES THEN WHY IF YOU CALL RHETORIC THE ART WHICH TREATS OF
DISCOURSE AND ALL THE OTHER ARTS TREAT OF DISCOURSE DO YOU NOT CALL
THEM ARTS OF RHETORIC
GORGIAS BECAUSE SOCRATES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE OTHER ARTS HAS ONLY TO
DO WITH SOME SORT OF EXTERNAL ACTION AS OF THE HAND BUT THERE IS NO
SUCH ACTION OF THE HAND IN RHETORIC WHICH WORKS AND TAKES EFFECT ONLY
THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF DISCOURSE
AND THEREFORE I AM JUSTIFIED IN SAYING
THAT RHETORIC TREATS OF DISCOURSE
SOCRATES I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND YOU BUT I DARE
SAY I SHALL SOON KNOW BETTER PLEASE TO ANSWER ME A QUESTION YOU WOULD
ALLOW THAT THERE ARE ARTS
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AS TO THE ARTS GENERALLY THEY ARE FOR THE MOST PART CONCERNED
WITH DOING AND REQUIRE LITTLE OR NO SPEAKING IN PAINTING AND
STATUARY AND MANY OTHER ARTS THE WORK MAY PROCEED IN SILENCE AND
OF SUCH ARTS I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD SAY THAT THEY DO NOT COME WITHIN THE
PROVINCE OF RHETORIC
GORGIAS YOU PERFECTLY CONCEIVE MY MEANING SOCRATES
SOCRATES BUT THERE ARE OTHER ARTS WHICH WORK WHOLLY THROUGH THE MEDIUM
OF LANGUAGE AND REQUIRE EITHER NO ACTION OR VERY LITTLE AS FOR
EXAMPLE THE ARTS OF ARITHMETIC OF CALCULATION OF GEOMETRY AND OF
PLAYING DRAUGHTS IN SOME OF THESE SPEECH IS PRETTY NEARLY CO EXTENSIVE
WITH ACTION BUT IN MOST OF THEM THE VERBAL ELEMENT IS GREATER THEY
DEPEND WHOLLY ON WORDS FOR THEIR EFFICACY AND POWER AND I TAKE YOUR
MEANING TO BE THAT RHETORIC IS AN ART OF THIS LATTER SORT
GORGIAS EXACTLY
SOCRATES AND YET I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU REALLY MEAN TO CALL ANY OF
THESE ARTS RHETORIC ALTHOUGH THE PRECISE EXPRESSION WHICH YOU USED WAS
THAT RHETORIC IS AN ART WHICH WORKS AND TAKES EFFECT ONLY THROUGH THE
MEDIUM OF DISCOURSE AND AN ADVERSARY WHO WISHED TO BE CAPTIOUS MIGHT
SAY 'AND SO GORGIAS YOU CALL ARITHMETIC RHETORIC BUT I DO NOT THINK
THAT YOU REALLY CALL ARITHMETIC RHETORIC ANY MORE THAN GEOMETRY WOULD BE
SO CALLED BY YOU
GORGIAS YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SOCRATES IN YOUR APPREHENSION OF MY
MEANING
SOCRATES WELL THEN LET ME NOW HAVE THE REST OF MY ANSWER SEEING
THAT RHETORIC IS ONE OF THOSE ARTS WHICH WORKS MAINLY BY THE USE OF
WORDS AND THERE ARE OTHER ARTS WHICH ALSO USE WORDS TELL ME WHAT IS
THAT QUALITY IN WORDS WITH WHICH RHETORIC IS CONCERNED SUPPOSE THAT A
PERSON ASKS ME ABOUT SOME OF THE ARTS WHICH I WAS MENTIONING JUST NOW
HE MIGHT SAY 'SOCRATES WHAT IS ARITHMETIC AND I SHOULD REPLY TO HIM
AS YOU REPLIED TO ME THAT ARITHMETIC IS ONE OF THOSE ARTS WHICH TAKE
EFFECT THROUGH WORDS
AND THEN HE WOULD PROCEED TO ASK 'WORDS ABOUT
WHAT AND I SHOULD REPLY WORDS ABOUT ODD AND EVEN NUMBERS AND HOW
MANY THERE ARE OF EACH
AND IF HE ASKED AGAIN 'WHAT IS THE ART OF
CALCULATION I SHOULD SAY THAT ALSO IS ONE OF THE ARTS WHICH IS
CONCERNED WHOLLY WITH WORDS
AND IF HE FURTHER SAID 'CONCERNED WITH
WHAT I SHOULD SAY LIKE THE CLERKS IN THE ASSEMBLY 'AS AFORESAID' OF
ARITHMETIC BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THE ART OF
CALCULATION CONSIDERS NOT ONLY THE QUANTITIES OF ODD AND EVEN NUMBERS
BUT ALSO THEIR NUMERICAL RELATIONS TO THEMSELVES AND TO ONE ANOTHER
AND SUPPOSE AGAIN I WERE TO SAY THAT ASTRONOMY IS ONLY WORDS HE WOULD
ASK 'WORDS ABOUT WHAT SOCRATES AND I SHOULD ANSWER THAT ASTRONOMY
TELLS US ABOUT THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS AND SUN AND MOON AND THEIR
RELATIVE SWIFTNESS
GORGIAS YOU WOULD BE QUITE RIGHT SOCRATES
SOCRATES AND NOW LET US HAVE FROM YOU GORGIAS THE TRUTH ABOUT
RHETORIC WHICH YOU WOULD ADMIT WOULD YOU NOT TO BE ONE OF THOSE ARTS
WHICH ACT ALWAYS AND FULFIL ALL THEIR ENDS THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF WORDS
GORGIAS TRUE
SOCRATES WORDS WHICH DO WHAT I SHOULD ASK
TO WHAT CLASS OF THINGS DO
THE WORDS WHICH RHETORIC USES RELATE
GORGIAS TO THE GREATEST SOCRATES AND THE BEST OF HUMAN THINGS
SOCRATES THAT AGAIN GORGIAS IS AMBIGUOUS I AM STILL IN THE DARK FOR
WHICH ARE THE GREATEST AND BEST OF HUMAN THINGS I DARE SAY THAT YOU
HAVE HEARD MEN SINGING AT FEASTS THE OLD DRINKING SONG IN WHICH THE
SINGERS ENUMERATE THE GOODS OF LIFE FIRST HEALTH BEAUTY NEXT THIRDLY
AS THE WRITER OF THE SONG SAYS WEALTH HONESTLY OBTAINED
GORGIAS YES I KNOW THE SONG BUT WHAT IS YOUR DRIFT
SOCRATES I MEAN TO SAY THAT THE PRODUCERS OF THOSE THINGS WHICH THE
AUTHOR OF THE SONG PRAISES THAT IS TO SAY THE PHYSICIAN THE TRAINER
THE MONEY MAKER WILL AT ONCE COME TO YOU AND FIRST THE PHYSICIAN WILL
SAY 'O SOCRATES GORGIAS IS DECEIVING YOU FOR MY ART IS CONCERNED WITH
THE GREATEST GOOD OF MEN AND NOT HIS AND WHEN I ASK WHO ARE YOU HE
WILL REPLY 'I AM A PHYSICIAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SHALL SAY
DO YOU
MEAN THAT YOUR ART PRODUCES THE GREATEST GOOD 'CERTAINLY HE WILL
ANSWER 'FOR IS NOT HEALTH THE GREATEST GOOD WHAT GREATER GOOD CAN MEN
HAVE SOCRATES AND AFTER HIM THE TRAINER WILL COME AND SAY 'I TOO
SOCRATES SHALL BE GREATLY SURPRISED IF GORGIAS CAN SHOW MORE GOOD OF
HIS ART THAN I CAN SHOW OF MINE TO HIM AGAIN I SHALL SAY WHO ARE
YOU HONEST FRIEND AND WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS 'I AM A TRAINER HE WILL
REPLY 'AND MY BUSINESS IS TO MAKE MEN BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG IN BODY
WHEN I HAVE DONE WITH THE TRAINER THERE ARRIVES THE MONEY MAKER AND
HE AS I EXPECT WILL UTTERLY DESPISE THEM ALL
'CONSIDER SOCRATES HE
WILL SAY 'WHETHER GORGIAS OR ANY ONE ELSE CAN PRODUCE ANY GREATER
GOOD THAN WEALTH WELL YOU AND I SAY TO HIM AND ARE YOU A CREATOR OF
WEALTH 'YES HE REPLIES
AND WHO ARE YOU 'A MONEY MAKER AND DO YOU
CONSIDER WEALTH TO BE THE GREATEST GOOD OF MAN 'OF COURSE WILL BE HIS
REPLY
AND WE SHALL REJOIN YES BUT OUR FRIEND GORGIAS CONTENDS THAT
HIS ART PRODUCES A GREATER GOOD THAN YOURS
AND THEN HE WILL BE SURE TO
GO ON AND ASK 'WHAT GOOD LET GORGIAS ANSWER NOW I WANT YOU GORGIAS
TO IMAGINE THAT THIS QUESTION IS ASKED OF YOU BY THEM AND BY ME WHAT
IS THAT WHICH AS YOU SAY IS THE GREATEST GOOD OF MAN AND OF WHICH YOU
ARE THE CREATOR ANSWER US
GORGIAS THAT GOOD SOCRATES WHICH IS TRULY THE GREATEST BEING THAT
WHICH GIVES TO MEN FREEDOM IN THEIR OWN PERSONS AND TO INDIVIDUALS THE
POWER OF RULING OVER OTHERS IN THEIR SEVERAL STATES
SOCRATES AND WHAT WOULD YOU CONSIDER THIS TO BE
GORGIAS WHAT IS THERE GREATER THAN THE WORD WHICH PERSUADES THE JUDGES
IN THE COURTS OR THE SENATORS IN THE COUNCIL OR THE CITIZENS IN THE
ASSEMBLY OR AT ANY OTHER POLITICAL MEETING IF YOU HAVE THE POWER
OF UTTERING THIS WORD YOU WILL HAVE THE PHYSICIAN YOUR SLAVE AND THE
TRAINER YOUR SLAVE AND THE MONEY MAKER OF WHOM YOU TALK WILL BE FOUND
TO GATHER TREASURES NOT FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR YOU WHO ARE ABLE TO SPEAK
AND TO PERSUADE THE MULTITUDE
SOCRATES NOW I THINK GORGIAS THAT YOU HAVE VERY ACCURATELY EXPLAINED
WHAT YOU CONCEIVE TO BE THE ART OF RHETORIC AND YOU MEAN TO SAY IF I
AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT RHETORIC IS THE ARTIFICER OF PERSUASION HAVING
THIS AND NO OTHER BUSINESS AND THAT THIS IS HER CROWN AND END
DO
YOU KNOW ANY OTHER EFFECT OF RHETORIC OVER AND ABOVE THAT OF PRODUCING
PERSUASION
GORGIAS NO THE DEFINITION SEEMS TO ME VERY FAIR SOCRATES FOR
PERSUASION IS THE CHIEF END OF RHETORIC
SOCRATES THEN HEAR ME GORGIAS FOR I AM QUITE SURE THAT IF THERE EVER
WAS A MAN WHO ENTERED ON THE DISCUSSION OF A MATTER FROM A PURE LOVE OF
KNOWING THE TRUTH I AM SUCH A ONE AND I SHOULD SAY THE SAME OF YOU
GORGIAS WHAT IS COMING SOCRATES
SOCRATES I WILL TELL YOU I AM VERY WELL AWARE THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT
ACCORDING TO YOU IS THE EXACT NATURE OR WHAT ARE THE TOPICS OF THAT
PERSUASION OF WHICH YOU SPEAK AND WHICH IS GIVEN BY RHETORIC ALTHOUGH
I HAVE A SUSPICION ABOUT BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER
AND I AM GOING TO
ASK WHAT IS THIS POWER OF PERSUASION WHICH IS GIVEN BY RHETORIC AND
ABOUT WHAT BUT WHY IF I HAVE A SUSPICION DO I ASK INSTEAD OF TELLING
YOU NOT FOR YOUR SAKE BUT IN ORDER THAT THE ARGUMENT MAY PROCEED IN
SUCH A MANNER AS IS MOST LIKELY TO SET FORTH THE TRUTH
AND I WOULD
HAVE YOU OBSERVE THAT I AM RIGHT IN ASKING THIS FURTHER QUESTION IF I
ASKED 'WHAT SORT OF A PAINTER IS ZEUXIS AND YOU SAID 'THE PAINTER
OF FIGURES SHOULD I NOT BE RIGHT IN ASKING 'WHAT KIND OF FIGURES AND
WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM
GORGIAS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND THE REASON FOR ASKING THIS SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE THAT
THERE ARE OTHER PAINTERS BESIDES WHO PAINT MANY OTHER FIGURES
GORGIAS TRUE
SOCRATES BUT IF THERE HAD BEEN NO ONE BUT ZEUXIS WHO PAINTED THEM THEN
YOU WOULD HAVE ANSWERED VERY WELL
GORGIAS QUITE SO
SOCRATES NOW I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT RHETORIC IN THE SAME WAY IS
RHETORIC THE ONLY ART WHICH BRINGS PERSUASION OR DO OTHER ARTS HAVE THE
SAME EFFECT I MEAN TO SAY DOES HE WHO TEACHES ANYTHING PERSUADE MEN OF
THAT WHICH HE TEACHES OR NOT
GORGIAS HE PERSUADES SOCRATES THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT
SOCRATES AGAIN IF WE TAKE THE ARTS OF WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW
SPEAKING DO NOT ARITHMETIC AND THE ARITHMETICIANS TEACH US THE
PROPERTIES OF NUMBER
GORGIAS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND THEREFORE PERSUADE US OF THEM
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES THEN ARITHMETIC AS WELL AS RHETORIC IS AN ARTIFICER OF
PERSUASION
GORGIAS CLEARLY
SOCRATES AND IF ANY ONE ASKS US WHAT SORT OF PERSUASION AND ABOUT
WHAT WE SHALL ANSWER PERSUASION WHICH TEACHES THE QUANTITY OF ODD AND
EVEN AND WE SHALL BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT ALL THE OTHER ARTS OF WHICH WE
WERE JUST NOW SPEAKING ARE ARTIFICERS OF PERSUASION AND OF WHAT SORT
AND ABOUT WHAT
GORGIAS VERY TRUE
SOCRATES THEN RHETORIC IS NOT THE ONLY ARTIFICER OF PERSUASION
GORGIAS TRUE
SOCRATES SEEING THEN THAT NOT ONLY RHETORIC WORKS BY PERSUASION BUT
THAT OTHER ARTS DO THE SAME AS IN THE CASE OF THE PAINTER A QUESTION
HAS ARISEN WHICH IS A VERY FAIR ONE OF WHAT PERSUASION IS RHETORIC
THE ARTIFICER AND ABOUT WHAT IS NOT THAT A FAIR WAY OF PUTTING THE
QUESTION
GORGIAS I THINK SO
SOCRATES THEN IF YOU APPROVE THE QUESTION GORGIAS WHAT IS THE
ANSWER
GORGIAS I ANSWER SOCRATES THAT RHETORIC IS THE ART OF PERSUASION IN
COURTS OF LAW AND OTHER ASSEMBLIES AS I WAS JUST NOW SAYING AND ABOUT
THE JUST AND UNJUST
SOCRATES AND THAT GORGIAS WAS WHAT I WAS SUSPECTING TO BE YOUR
NOTION YET I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU WONDER IF BY AND BY I AM FOUND
REPEATING A SEEMINGLY PLAIN QUESTION FOR I ASK NOT IN ORDER TO CONFUTE
YOU BUT AS I WAS SAYING THAT THE ARGUMENT MAY PROCEED CONSECUTIVELY
AND THAT WE MAY NOT GET THE HABIT OF ANTICIPATING AND SUSPECTING THE
MEANING OF ONE ANOTHER'S WORDS I WOULD HAVE YOU DEVELOPE YOUR OWN VIEWS
IN YOUR OWN WAY WHATEVER MAY BE YOUR HYPOTHESIS
GORGIAS I THINK THAT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SOCRATES
SOCRATES THEN LET ME RAISE ANOTHER QUESTION THERE IS SUCH A THING AS
'HAVING LEARNED'
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND THERE IS ALSO 'HAVING BELIEVED'
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND IS THE 'HAVING LEARNED' THE SAME AS 'HAVING BELIEVED AND
ARE LEARNING AND BELIEF THE SAME THINGS
GORGIAS IN MY JUDGMENT SOCRATES THEY ARE NOT THE SAME
SOCRATES AND YOUR JUDGMENT IS RIGHT AS YOU MAY ASCERTAIN IN THIS
WAY IF A PERSON WERE TO SAY TO YOU 'IS THERE GORGIAS A FALSE BELIEF
AS WELL AS A TRUE YOU WOULD REPLY IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT THERE
IS
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES WELL BUT IS THERE A FALSE KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS A TRUE
GORGIAS NO
SOCRATES NO INDEED AND THIS AGAIN PROVES THAT KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF
DIFFER
GORGIAS VERY TRUE
SOCRATES AND YET THOSE WHO HAVE LEARNED AS WELL AS THOSE WHO HAVE
BELIEVED ARE PERSUADED
GORGIAS JUST SO
SOCRATES SHALL WE THEN ASSUME TWO SORTS OF PERSUASION ONE WHICH IS
THE SOURCE OF BELIEF WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE AS THE OTHER IS OF KNOWLEDGE
GORGIAS BY ALL MEANS
SOCRATES AND WHICH SORT OF PERSUASION DOES RHETORIC CREATE IN COURTS
OF LAW AND OTHER ASSEMBLIES ABOUT THE JUST AND UNJUST THE SORT OF
PERSUASION WHICH GIVES BELIEF WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR THAT WHICH GIVES
KNOWLEDGE
GORGIAS CLEARLY SOCRATES THAT WHICH ONLY GIVES BELIEF
SOCRATES THEN RHETORIC AS WOULD APPEAR IS THE ARTIFICER OF A
PERSUASION WHICH CREATES BELIEF ABOUT THE JUST AND UNJUST BUT GIVES NO
INSTRUCTION ABOUT THEM
GORGIAS TRUE
SOCRATES AND THE RHETORICIAN DOES NOT INSTRUCT THE COURTS OF LAW OR
OTHER ASSEMBLIES ABOUT THINGS JUST AND UNJUST BUT HE CREATES BELIEF
ABOUT THEM FOR NO ONE CAN BE SUPPOSED TO INSTRUCT SUCH A VAST MULTITUDE
ABOUT SUCH HIGH MATTERS IN A SHORT TIME
GORGIAS CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES COME THEN AND LET US SEE WHAT WE REALLY MEAN ABOUT RHETORIC
FOR I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MY OWN MEANING IS AS YET
WHEN THE ASSEMBLY MEETS
TO ELECT A PHYSICIAN OR A SHIPWRIGHT OR ANY OTHER CRAFTSMAN WILL THE
RHETORICIAN BE TAKEN INTO COUNSEL SURELY NOT
FOR AT EVERY ELECTION HE
OUGHT TO BE CHOSEN WHO IS MOST SKILLED AND AGAIN WHEN WALLS HAVE TO
BE BUILT OR HARBOURS OR DOCKS TO BE CONSTRUCTED NOT THE RHETORICIAN BUT
THE MASTER WORKMAN WILL ADVISE OR WHEN GENERALS HAVE TO BE CHOSEN AND
AN ORDER OF BATTLE ARRANGED OR A POSITION TAKEN THEN THE MILITARY WILL
ADVISE AND NOT THE RHETORICIANS WHAT DO YOU SAY GORGIAS SINCE YOU
PROFESS TO BE A RHETORICIAN AND A MAKER OF RHETORICIANS I CANNOT DO
BETTER THAN LEARN THE NATURE OF YOUR ART FROM YOU
AND HERE LET ME
ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE YOUR INTEREST IN VIEW AS WELL AS MY OWN
FOR
LIKELY ENOUGH SOME ONE OR OTHER OF THE YOUNG MEN PRESENT MIGHT DESIRE TO
BECOME YOUR PUPIL AND IN FACT I SEE SOME AND A GOOD MANY TOO WHO HAVE
THIS WISH BUT THEY WOULD BE TOO MODEST TO QUESTION YOU
AND THEREFORE
WHEN YOU ARE INTERROGATED BY ME I WOULD HAVE YOU IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE
INTERROGATED BY THEM
'WHAT IS THE USE OF COMING TO YOU GORGIAS THEY
WILL SAY 'ABOUT WHAT WILL YOU TEACH US TO ADVISE THE STATE ABOUT THE
JUST AND UNJUST ONLY OR ABOUT THOSE OTHER THINGS ALSO WHICH SOCRATES
HAS JUST MENTIONED HOW WILL YOU ANSWER THEM
GORGIAS I LIKE YOUR WAY OF LEADING US ON SOCRATES AND I WILL
ENDEAVOUR TO REVEAL TO YOU THE WHOLE NATURE OF RHETORIC
YOU MUST HAVE
HEARD I THINK THAT THE DOCKS AND THE WALLS OF THE ATHENIANS AND THE
PLAN OF THE HARBOUR WERE DEVISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COUNSELS PARTLY
OF THEMISTOCLES AND PARTLY OF PERICLES AND NOT AT THE SUGGESTION OF
THE BUILDERS
SOCRATES SUCH IS THE TRADITION GORGIAS ABOUT THEMISTOCLES AND I
MYSELF HEARD THE SPEECH OF PERICLES WHEN HE ADVISED US ABOUT THE MIDDLE
WALL
GORGIAS AND YOU WILL OBSERVE SOCRATES THAT WHEN A DECISION HAS TO BE
GIVEN IN SUCH MATTERS THE RHETORICIANS ARE THE ADVISERS THEY ARE THE
MEN WHO WIN THEIR POINT
SOCRATES I HAD THAT IN MY ADMIRING MIND GORGIAS WHEN I ASKED WHAT IS
THE NATURE OF RHETORIC WHICH ALWAYS APPEARS TO ME WHEN I LOOK AT THE
MATTER IN THIS WAY TO BE A MARVEL OF GREATNESS
GORGIAS A MARVEL INDEED SOCRATES IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW RHETORIC
COMPREHENDS AND HOLDS UNDER HER SWAY ALL THE INFERIOR ARTS
LET ME OFFER
YOU A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THIS
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I HAVE BEEN WITH
MY BROTHER HERODICUS OR SOME OTHER PHYSICIAN TO SEE ONE OF HIS PATIENTS
WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PHYSICIAN TO GIVE HIM MEDICINE OR APPLY THE
KNIFE OR HOT IRON TO HIM AND I HAVE PERSUADED HIM TO DO FOR ME WHAT HE
WOULD NOT DO FOR THE PHYSICIAN JUST BY THE USE OF RHETORIC
AND I SAY
THAT IF A RHETORICIAN AND A PHYSICIAN WERE TO GO TO ANY CITY AND HAD
THERE TO ARGUE IN THE ECCLESIA OR ANY OTHER ASSEMBLY AS TO WHICH OF THEM
SHOULD BE ELECTED STATE PHYSICIAN THE PHYSICIAN WOULD HAVE NO CHANCE
BUT HE WHO COULD SPEAK WOULD BE CHOSEN IF HE WISHED AND IN A CONTEST
WITH A MAN OF ANY OTHER PROFESSION THE RHETORICIAN MORE THAN ANY ONE
WOULD HAVE THE POWER OF GETTING HIMSELF CHOSEN FOR HE CAN SPEAK MORE
PERSUASIVELY TO THE MULTITUDE THAN ANY OF THEM AND ON ANY SUBJECT
SUCH IS THE NATURE AND POWER OF THE ART OF RHETORIC AND YET SOCRATES
RHETORIC SHOULD BE USED LIKE ANY OTHER COMPETITIVE ART NOT AGAINST
EVERYBODY THE RHETORICIAN OUGHT NOT TO ABUSE HIS STRENGTH ANY MORE
THAN A PUGILIST OR PANCRATIAST OR OTHER MASTER OF FENCE BECAUSE HE HAS
POWERS WHICH ARE MORE THAN A MATCH EITHER FOR FRIEND OR ENEMY HE OUGHT
NOT THEREFORE TO STRIKE STAB OR SLAY HIS FRIENDS
SUPPOSE A MAN TO
HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THE PALESTRA AND TO BE A SKILFUL BOXER HE IN THE
FULNESS OF HIS STRENGTH GOES AND STRIKES HIS FATHER OR MOTHER OR ONE
OF HIS FAMILIARS OR FRIENDS BUT THAT IS NO REASON WHY THE TRAINERS
OR FENCING MASTERS SHOULD BE HELD IN DETESTATION OR BANISHED FROM THE
CITY SURELY NOT
FOR THEY TAUGHT THEIR ART FOR A GOOD PURPOSE TO BE
USED AGAINST ENEMIES AND EVIL DOERS IN SELF DEFENCE NOT IN AGGRESSION
AND OTHERS HAVE PERVERTED THEIR INSTRUCTIONS AND TURNED TO A BAD USE
THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SKILL
BUT NOT ON THIS ACCOUNT ARE THE TEACHERS
BAD NEITHER IS THE ART IN FAULT OR BAD IN ITSELF I SHOULD RATHER
SAY THAT THOSE WHO MAKE A BAD USE OF THE ART ARE TO BLAME
AND THE SAME
ARGUMENT HOLDS GOOD OF RHETORIC FOR THE RHETORICIAN CAN SPEAK AGAINST
ALL MEN AND UPON ANY SUBJECT IN SHORT HE CAN PERSUADE THE MULTITUDE
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MAN OF ANYTHING WHICH HE PLEASES BUT HE SHOULD
NOT THEREFORE SEEK TO DEFRAUD THE PHYSICIAN OR ANY OTHER ARTIST OF HIS
REPUTATION MERELY BECAUSE HE HAS THE POWER HE OUGHT TO USE RHETORIC
FAIRLY AS HE WOULD ALSO USE HIS ATHLETIC POWERS
AND IF AFTER HAVING
BECOME A RHETORICIAN HE MAKES A BAD USE OF HIS STRENGTH AND SKILL HIS
INSTRUCTOR SURELY OUGHT NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE HELD IN DETESTATION OR
BANISHED
FOR HE WAS INTENDED BY HIS TEACHER TO MAKE A GOOD USE OF HIS
INSTRUCTIONS BUT HE ABUSES THEM
AND THEREFORE HE IS THE PERSON WHO
OUGHT TO BE HELD IN DETESTATION BANISHED AND PUT TO DEATH AND NOT HIS
INSTRUCTOR
SOCRATES YOU GORGIAS LIKE MYSELF HAVE HAD GREAT EXPERIENCE OF
DISPUTATIONS AND YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED I THINK THAT THEY DO NOT
ALWAYS TERMINATE IN MUTUAL EDIFICATION OR IN THE DEFINITION BY EITHER
PARTY OF THE SUBJECTS WHICH THEY ARE DISCUSSING BUT DISAGREEMENTS
ARE APT TO ARISE SOMEBODY SAYS THAT ANOTHER HAS NOT SPOKEN TRULY OR
CLEARLY AND THEN THEY GET INTO A PASSION AND BEGIN TO QUARREL BOTH
PARTIES CONCEIVING THAT THEIR OPPONENTS ARE ARGUING FROM PERSONAL
FEELING ONLY AND JEALOUSY OF THEMSELVES NOT FROM ANY INTEREST IN THE
QUESTION AT ISSUE
AND SOMETIMES THEY WILL GO ON ABUSING ONE ANOTHER
UNTIL THE COMPANY AT LAST ARE QUITE VEXED AT THEMSELVES FOR EVER
LISTENING TO SUCH FELLOWS
WHY DO I SAY THIS WHY BECAUSE I CANNOT
HELP FEELING THAT YOU ARE NOW SAYING WHAT IS NOT QUITE CONSISTENT OR
ACCORDANT WITH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING AT FIRST ABOUT RHETORIC
AND I AM
AFRAID TO POINT THIS OUT TO YOU LEST YOU SHOULD THINK THAT I HAVE SOME
ANIMOSITY AGAINST YOU AND THAT I SPEAK NOT FOR THE SAKE OF DISCOVERING
THE TRUTH BUT FROM JEALOUSY OF YOU
NOW IF YOU ARE ONE OF MY SORT I
SHOULD LIKE TO CROSS EXAMINE YOU BUT IF NOT I WILL LET YOU ALONE
AND
WHAT IS MY SORT YOU WILL ASK
I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO ARE VERY WILLING
TO BE REFUTED IF I SAY ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT TRUE AND VERY WILLING TO
REFUTE ANY ONE ELSE WHO SAYS WHAT IS NOT TRUE AND QUITE AS READY TO BE
REFUTED AS TO REFUTE FOR I HOLD THAT THIS IS THE GREATER GAIN OF THE
TWO JUST AS THE GAIN IS GREATER OF BEING CURED OF A VERY GREAT EVIL
THAN OF CURING ANOTHER
FOR I IMAGINE THAT THERE IS NO EVIL WHICH A MAN
CAN ENDURE SO GREAT AS AN ERRONEOUS OPINION ABOUT THE MATTERS OF WHICH
WE ARE SPEAKING AND IF YOU CLAIM TO BE ONE OF MY SORT LET US HAVE THE
DISCUSSION OUT BUT IF YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE DONE NO MATTER LET US
MAKE AN END OF IT
GORGIAS I SHOULD SAY SOCRATES THAT I AM QUITE THE MAN WHOM YOU
INDICATE BUT PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO CONSIDER THE AUDIENCE FOR BEFORE
YOU CAME I HAD ALREADY GIVEN A LONG EXHIBITION AND IF WE PROCEED THE
ARGUMENT MAY RUN ON TO A GREAT LENGTH
AND THEREFORE I THINK THAT WE
SHOULD CONSIDER WHETHER WE MAY NOT BE DETAINING SOME PART OF THE COMPANY
WHEN THEY ARE WANTING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE
CHAEREPHON YOU HEAR THE AUDIENCE CHEERING GORGIAS AND SOCRATES WHICH
SHOWS THEIR DESIRE TO LISTEN TO YOU AND FOR MYSELF HEAVEN FORBID
THAT I SHOULD HAVE ANY BUSINESS ON HAND WHICH WOULD TAKE ME AWAY FROM A
DISCUSSION SO INTERESTING AND SO ABLY MAINTAINED
CALLICLES BY THE GODS CHAEREPHON ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN PRESENT AT MANY
DISCUSSIONS I DOUBT WHETHER I WAS EVER SO MUCH DELIGHTED BEFORE
AND THEREFORE IF YOU GO ON DISCOURSING ALL DAY I SHALL BE THE BETTER
PLEASED
SOCRATES I MAY TRULY SAY CALLICLES THAT I AM WILLING IF GORGIAS IS
GORGIAS AFTER ALL THIS SOCRATES I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IF I REFUSED
ESPECIALLY AS I HAVE PROMISED TO ANSWER ALL COMERS IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE WISHES OF THE COMPANY THEN DO YOU BEGIN AND ASK OF ME ANY
QUESTION WHICH YOU LIKE
SOCRATES LET ME TELL YOU THEN GORGIAS WHAT SURPRISES ME IN YOUR
WORDS THOUGH I DARE SAY THAT YOU MAY BE RIGHT AND I MAY HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR MEANING
YOU SAY THAT YOU CAN MAKE ANY MAN WHO WILL
LEARN OF YOU A RHETORICIAN
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU WILL TEACH HIM TO GAIN THE EARS OF THE
MULTITUDE ON ANY SUBJECT AND THIS NOT BY INSTRUCTION BUT BY PERSUASION
GORGIAS QUITE SO
SOCRATES YOU WERE SAYING IN FACT THAT THE RHETORICIAN WILL HAVE
GREATER POWERS OF PERSUASION THAN THE PHYSICIAN EVEN IN A MATTER OF
HEALTH
GORGIAS YES WITH THE MULTITUDE THAT IS
SOCRATES YOU MEAN TO SAY WITH THE IGNORANT FOR WITH THOSE WHO KNOW HE
CANNOT BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE GREATER POWERS OF PERSUASION
GORGIAS VERY TRUE
SOCRATES BUT IF HE IS TO HAVE MORE POWER OF PERSUASION THAN THE
PHYSICIAN HE WILL HAVE GREATER POWER THAN HE WHO KNOWS
GORGIAS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT A PHYSICIAN IS HE
GORGIAS NO
SOCRATES AND HE WHO IS NOT A PHYSICIAN MUST OBVIOUSLY BE IGNORANT OF
WHAT THE PHYSICIAN KNOWS
GORGIAS CLEARLY
SOCRATES THEN WHEN THE RHETORICIAN IS MORE PERSUASIVE THAN THE
PHYSICIAN THE IGNORANT IS MORE PERSUASIVE WITH THE IGNORANT THAN HE WHO
HAS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THAT THE INFERENCE
GORGIAS IN THE CASE SUPPOSED YES
SOCRATES AND THE SAME HOLDS OF THE RELATION OF RHETORIC TO ALL THE
OTHER ARTS THE RHETORICIAN NEED NOT KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT THINGS HE HAS
ONLY TO DISCOVER SOME WAY OF PERSUADING THE IGNORANT THAT HE HAS MORE
KNOWLEDGE THAN THOSE WHO KNOW
GORGIAS YES SOCRATES AND IS NOT THIS A GREAT COMFORT NOT TO HAVE
LEARNED THE OTHER ARTS BUT THE ART OF RHETORIC ONLY AND YET TO BE IN
NO WAY INFERIOR TO THE PROFESSORS OF THEM
SOCRATES WHETHER THE RHETORICIAN IS OR NOT INFERIOR ON THIS ACCOUNT IS
A QUESTION WHICH WE WILL HEREAFTER EXAMINE IF THE ENQUIRY IS LIKELY TO
BE OF ANY SERVICE TO US BUT I WOULD RATHER BEGIN BY ASKING WHETHER HE
IS OR IS NOT AS IGNORANT OF THE JUST AND UNJUST BASE AND HONOURABLE
GOOD AND EVIL AS HE IS OF MEDICINE AND THE OTHER ARTS I MEAN TO
SAY DOES HE REALLY KNOW ANYTHING OF WHAT IS GOOD AND EVIL BASE OR
HONOURABLE JUST OR UNJUST IN THEM OR HAS HE ONLY A WAY WITH THE
IGNORANT OF PERSUADING THEM THAT HE NOT KNOWING IS TO BE ESTEEMED TO
KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS THAN SOME ONE ELSE WHO KNOWS OR MUST
THE PUPIL KNOW THESE THINGS AND COME TO YOU KNOWING THEM BEFORE HE CAN
ACQUIRE THE ART OF RHETORIC IF HE IS IGNORANT YOU WHO ARE THE TEACHER
OF RHETORIC WILL NOT TEACH HIM IT IS NOT YOUR BUSINESS BUT YOU WILL
MAKE HIM SEEM TO THE MULTITUDE TO KNOW THEM WHEN HE DOES NOT KNOW THEM
AND SEEM TO BE A GOOD MAN WHEN HE IS NOT
OR WILL YOU BE UNABLE TO
TEACH HIM RHETORIC AT ALL UNLESS HE KNOWS THE TRUTH OF THESE THINGS
FIRST WHAT IS TO BE SAID ABOUT ALL THIS BY HEAVENS GORGIAS I WISH
THAT YOU WOULD REVEAL TO ME THE POWER OF RHETORIC AS YOU WERE SAYING
THAT YOU WOULD
GORGIAS WELL SOCRATES I SUPPOSE THAT IF THE PUPIL DOES CHANCE NOT TO
KNOW THEM HE WILL HAVE TO LEARN OF ME THESE THINGS AS WELL
SOCRATES SAY NO MORE FOR THERE YOU ARE RIGHT AND SO HE WHOM YOU
MAKE A RHETORICIAN MUST EITHER KNOW THE NATURE OF THE JUST AND UNJUST
ALREADY OR HE MUST BE TAUGHT BY YOU
GORGIAS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES WELL AND IS NOT HE WHO HAS LEARNED CARPENTERING A CARPENTER
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND HE WHO HAS LEARNED MUSIC A MUSICIAN
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND HE WHO HAS LEARNED MEDICINE IS A PHYSICIAN IN LIKE
MANNER HE WHO HAS LEARNED ANYTHING WHATEVER IS THAT WHICH HIS KNOWLEDGE
MAKES HIM
GORGIAS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND IN THE SAME WAY HE WHO HAS LEARNED WHAT IS JUST IS JUST
GORGIAS TO BE SURE
SOCRATES AND HE WHO IS JUST MAY BE SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT IS JUST
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND MUST NOT THE JUST MAN ALWAYS DESIRE TO DO WHAT IS JUST
GORGIAS THAT IS CLEARLY THE INFERENCE
SOCRATES SURELY THEN THE JUST MAN WILL NEVER CONSENT TO DO INJUSTICE
GORGIAS CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES AND ACCORDING TO THE ARGUMENT THE RHETORICIAN MUST BE A JUST
MAN
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES AND WILL THEREFORE NEVER BE WILLING TO DO INJUSTICE
GORGIAS CLEARLY NOT
SOCRATES BUT DO YOU REMEMBER SAYING JUST NOW THAT THE TRAINER IS NOT
TO BE ACCUSED OR BANISHED IF THE PUGILIST MAKES A WRONG USE OF HIS
PUGILISTIC ART AND IN LIKE MANNER IF THE RHETORICIAN MAKES A BAD AND
UNJUST USE OF HIS RHETORIC THAT IS NOT TO BE LAID TO THE CHARGE OF HIS
TEACHER WHO IS NOT TO BE BANISHED BUT THE WRONG DOER HIMSELF WHO MADE
A BAD USE OF HIS RHETORIC HE IS TO BE BANISHED WAS NOT THAT SAID
GORGIAS YES IT WAS
SOCRATES BUT NOW WE ARE AFFIRMING THAT THE AFORESAID RHETORICIAN WILL
NEVER HAVE DONE INJUSTICE AT ALL
GORGIAS TRUE
SOCRATES AND AT THE VERY OUTSET GORGIAS IT WAS SAID THAT RHETORIC
TREATED OF DISCOURSE NOT LIKE ARITHMETIC ABOUT ODD AND EVEN BUT
ABOUT JUST AND UNJUST WAS NOT THIS SAID
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES I WAS THINKING AT THE TIME WHEN I HEARD YOU SAYING SO THAT
RHETORIC WHICH IS ALWAYS DISCOURSING ABOUT JUSTICE COULD NOT POSSIBLY
BE AN UNJUST THING
BUT WHEN YOU ADDED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THAT THE
RHETORICIAN MIGHT MAKE A BAD USE OF RHETORIC I NOTED WITH SURPRISE
THE INCONSISTENCY INTO WHICH YOU HAD FALLEN AND I SAID THAT IF YOU
THOUGHT AS I DID THAT THERE WAS A GAIN IN BEING REFUTED THERE WOULD
BE AN ADVANTAGE IN GOING ON WITH THE QUESTION BUT IF NOT I WOULD LEAVE
OFF
AND IN THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS AS YOU WILL SEE YOURSELF
THE RHETORICIAN HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE INCAPABLE OF MAKING AN
UNJUST USE OF RHETORIC OR OF WILLINGNESS TO DO INJUSTICE
BY THE DOG
GORGIAS THERE WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION BEFORE WE GET AT THE
TRUTH OF ALL THIS
POLUS AND DO EVEN YOU SOCRATES SERIOUSLY BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE NOW
SAYING ABOUT RHETORIC WHAT BECAUSE GORGIAS WAS ASHAMED TO DENY THAT
THE RHETORICIAN KNEW THE JUST AND THE HONOURABLE AND THE GOOD AND
ADMITTED THAT TO ANY ONE WHO CAME TO HIM IGNORANT OF THEM HE COULD TEACH
THEM AND THEN OUT OF THIS ADMISSION THERE AROSE A CONTRADICTION THE
THING WHICH YOU DEARLY LOVE AND TO WHICH NOT HE BUT YOU BROUGHT THE
ARGUMENT BY YOUR CAPTIOUS QUESTIONS DO YOU SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT
THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN ALL THIS FOR WILL ANY ONE EVER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
HE DOES NOT KNOW OR CANNOT TEACH THE NATURE OF JUSTICE THE TRUTH IS
THAT THERE IS GREAT WANT OF MANNERS IN BRINGING THE ARGUMENT TO SUCH A
PASS
SOCRATES ILLUSTRIOUS POLUS THE REASON WHY WE PROVIDE OURSELVES WITH
FRIENDS AND CHILDREN IS THAT WHEN WE GET OLD AND STUMBLE A YOUNGER
GENERATION MAY BE AT HAND TO SET US ON OUR LEGS AGAIN IN OUR WORDS AND
IN OUR ACTIONS AND NOW IF I AND GORGIAS ARE STUMBLING HERE ARE YOU
WHO SHOULD RAISE US UP AND I FOR MY PART ENGAGE TO RETRACT ANY ERROR
INTO WHICH YOU MAY THINK THAT I HAVE FALLEN UPON ONE CONDITION
POLUS WHAT CONDITION
SOCRATES THAT YOU CONTRACT POLUS THE PROLIXITY OF SPEECH IN WHICH YOU
INDULGED AT FIRST
POLUS WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT I MAY NOT USE AS MANY WORDS AS I PLEASE
SOCRATES ONLY TO THINK MY FRIEND THAT HAVING COME ON A VISIT TO
ATHENS WHICH IS THE MOST FREE SPOKEN STATE IN HELLAS YOU WHEN YOU GOT
THERE AND YOU ALONE SHOULD BE DEPRIVED OF THE POWER OF SPEECH THAT
WOULD BE HARD INDEED
BUT THEN CONSIDER MY CASE SHALL NOT I BE VERY
HARDLY USED IF WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A LONG ORATION AND REFUSING TO
ANSWER WHAT YOU ARE ASKED I AM COMPELLED TO STAY AND LISTEN TO YOU
AND MAY NOT GO AWAY I SAY RATHER IF YOU HAVE A REAL INTEREST IN THE
ARGUMENT OR TO REPEAT MY FORMER EXPRESSION HAVE ANY DESIRE TO SET IT
ON ITS LEGS TAKE BACK ANY STATEMENT WHICH YOU PLEASE AND IN YOUR TURN
ASK AND ANSWER LIKE MYSELF AND GORGIAS REFUTE AND BE REFUTED FOR I
SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT GORGIAS KNOWS WOULD YOU NOT
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND YOU LIKE HIM INVITE ANY ONE TO ASK YOU ABOUT ANYTHING
WHICH HE PLEASES AND YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO ANSWER HIM
POLUS TO BE SURE
SOCRATES AND NOW WHICH WILL YOU DO ASK OR ANSWER
POLUS I WILL ASK AND DO YOU ANSWER ME SOCRATES THE SAME QUESTION
WHICH GORGIAS AS YOU SUPPOSE IS UNABLE TO ANSWER WHAT IS RHETORIC
SOCRATES DO YOU MEAN WHAT SORT OF AN ART
POLUS YES
SOCRATES TO SAY THE TRUTH POLUS IT IS NOT AN ART AT ALL IN MY
OPINION
POLUS THEN WHAT IN YOUR OPINION IS RHETORIC
SOCRATES A THING WHICH AS I WAS LATELY READING IN A BOOK OF YOURS YOU
SAY THAT YOU HAVE MADE AN ART
POLUS WHAT THING
SOCRATES I SHOULD SAY A SORT OF EXPERIENCE
POLUS DOES RHETORIC SEEM TO YOU TO BE AN EXPERIENCE
SOCRATES THAT IS MY VIEW BUT YOU MAY BE OF ANOTHER MIND
POLUS AN EXPERIENCE IN WHAT
SOCRATES AN EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCING A SORT OF DELIGHT AND
GRATIFICATION
POLUS AND IF ABLE TO GRATIFY OTHERS MUST NOT RHETORIC BE A FINE THING
SOCRATES WHAT ARE YOU SAYING POLUS WHY DO YOU ASK ME WHETHER RHETORIC
IS A FINE THING OR NOT WHEN I HAVE NOT AS YET TOLD YOU WHAT RHETORIC
IS
POLUS DID I NOT HEAR YOU SAY THAT RHETORIC WAS A SORT OF EXPERIENCE
SOCRATES WILL YOU WHO ARE SO DESIROUS TO GRATIFY OTHERS AFFORD A
SLIGHT GRATIFICATION TO ME
POLUS I WILL
SOCRATES WILL YOU ASK ME WHAT SORT OF AN ART IS COOKERY
POLUS WHAT SORT OF AN ART IS COOKERY
SOCRATES NOT AN ART AT ALL POLUS
POLUS WHAT THEN
SOCRATES I SHOULD SAY AN EXPERIENCE
POLUS IN WHAT I WISH THAT YOU WOULD EXPLAIN TO ME
SOCRATES AN EXPERIENCE IN PRODUCING A SORT OF DELIGHT AND
GRATIFICATION POLUS
POLUS THEN ARE COOKERY AND RHETORIC THE SAME
SOCRATES NO THEY ARE ONLY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SAME PROFESSION
POLUS OF WHAT PROFESSION
SOCRATES I AM AFRAID THAT THE TRUTH MAY SEEM DISCOURTEOUS AND I
HESITATE TO ANSWER LEST GORGIAS SHOULD IMAGINE THAT I AM MAKING FUN OF
HIS OWN PROFESSION
FOR WHETHER OR NO THIS IS THAT ART OF RHETORIC
WHICH GORGIAS PRACTISES I REALLY CANNOT TELL FROM WHAT HE WAS JUST NOW
SAYING NOTHING APPEARED OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF HIS ART BUT THE RHETORIC
WHICH I MEAN IS A PART OF A NOT VERY CREDITABLE WHOLE
GORGIAS A PART OF WHAT SOCRATES SAY WHAT YOU MEAN AND NEVER MIND ME
SOCRATES IN MY OPINION THEN GORGIAS THE WHOLE OF WHICH RHETORIC IS A
PART IS NOT AN ART AT ALL BUT THE HABIT OF A BOLD AND READY WIT
WHICH KNOWS HOW TO MANAGE MANKIND THIS HABIT I SUM UP UNDER THE WORD
'FLATTERY' AND IT APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE MANY OTHER PARTS ONE OF WHICH
IS COOKERY WHICH MAY SEEM TO BE AN ART BUT AS I MAINTAIN IS ONLY AN
EXPERIENCE OR ROUTINE AND NOT AN ART ANOTHER PART IS RHETORIC AND
THE ART OF ATTIRING AND SOPHISTRY ARE TWO OTHERS THUS THERE ARE FOUR
BRANCHES AND FOUR DIFFERENT THINGS ANSWERING TO THEM
AND POLUS MAY
ASK IF HE LIKES FOR HE HAS NOT AS YET BEEN INFORMED WHAT PART OF
FLATTERY IS RHETORIC HE DID NOT SEE THAT I HAD NOT YET ANSWERED HIM
WHEN HE PROCEEDED TO ASK A FURTHER QUESTION WHETHER I DO NOT THINK
RHETORIC A FINE THING BUT I SHALL NOT TELL HIM WHETHER RHETORIC IS A
FINE THING OR NOT UNTIL I HAVE FIRST ANSWERED 'WHAT IS RHETORIC FOR
THAT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT POLUS BUT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IF YOU
WILL ASK ME WHAT PART OF FLATTERY IS RHETORIC
POLUS I WILL ASK AND DO YOU ANSWER WHAT PART OF FLATTERY IS RHETORIC
SOCRATES WILL YOU UNDERSTAND MY ANSWER RHETORIC ACCORDING TO MY VIEW
IS THE GHOST OR COUNTERFEIT OF A PART OF POLITICS
POLUS AND NOBLE OR IGNOBLE
SOCRATES IGNOBLE I SHOULD SAY IF I AM COMPELLED TO ANSWER FOR I CALL
WHAT IS BAD IGNOBLE THOUGH I DOUBT WHETHER YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS
SAYING BEFORE
GORGIAS INDEED SOCRATES I CANNOT SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND MYSELF
SOCRATES I DO NOT WONDER GORGIAS FOR I HAVE NOT AS YET EXPLAINED
MYSELF AND OUR FRIEND POLUS COLT BY NAME AND COLT BY NATURE IS APT
TO RUN AWAY
THIS IS AN UNTRANSLATABLE PLAY ON THE NAME 'POLUS WHICH
MEANS 'A COLT
GORGIAS NEVER MIND HIM BUT EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING THAT
RHETORIC IS THE COUNTERFEIT OF A PART OF POLITICS
SOCRATES I WILL TRY THEN TO EXPLAIN MY NOTION OF RHETORIC AND IF
I AM MISTAKEN MY FRIEND POLUS SHALL REFUTE ME
WE MAY ASSUME THE
EXISTENCE OF BODIES AND OF SOULS
GORGIAS OF COURSE
SOCRATES YOU WOULD FURTHER ADMIT THAT THERE IS A GOOD CONDITION OF
EITHER OF THEM
GORGIAS YES
SOCRATES WHICH CONDITION MAY NOT BE REALLY GOOD BUT GOOD ONLY IN
APPEARANCE I MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE ARE MANY PERSONS WHO APPEAR TO
BE IN GOOD HEALTH AND WHOM ONLY A PHYSICIAN OR TRAINER WILL DISCERN AT
FIRST SIGHT NOT TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH
GORGIAS TRUE
SOCRATES AND THIS APPLIES NOT ONLY TO THE BODY BUT ALSO TO THE SOUL
IN EITHER THERE MAY BE THAT WHICH GIVES THE APPEARANCE OF HEALTH AND NOT
THE REALITY
GORGIAS YES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND NOW I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN TO YOU MORE CLEARLY WHAT I
MEAN THE SOUL AND BODY BEING TWO HAVE TWO ARTS CORRESPONDING TO THEM
THERE IS THE ART OF POLITICS ATTENDING ON THE SOUL AND ANOTHER ART
ATTENDING ON THE BODY OF WHICH I KNOW NO SINGLE NAME BUT WHICH MAY BE
DESCRIBED AS HAVING TWO DIVISIONS ONE OF THEM GYMNASTIC AND THE OTHER
MEDICINE
AND IN POLITICS THERE IS A LEGISLATIVE PART WHICH ANSWERS TO
GYMNASTIC AS JUSTICE DOES TO MEDICINE AND THE TWO PARTS RUN INTO ONE
ANOTHER JUSTICE HAVING TO DO WITH THE SAME SUBJECT AS LEGISLATION AND
MEDICINE WITH THE SAME SUBJECT AS GYMNASTIC BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE
NOW
SEEING THAT THERE ARE THESE FOUR ARTS TWO ATTENDING ON THE BODY AND TWO
ON THE SOUL FOR THEIR HIGHEST GOOD FLATTERY KNOWING OR RATHER GUESSING
THEIR NATURES HAS DISTRIBUTED HERSELF INTO FOUR SHAMS OR SIMULATIONS
OF THEM SHE PUTS ON THE LIKENESS OF SOME ONE OR OTHER OF THEM AND
PRETENDS TO BE THAT WHICH SHE SIMULATES AND HAVING NO REGARD FOR MEN'S
HIGHEST INTERESTS IS EVER MAKING PLEASURE THE BAIT OF THE UNWARY AND
DECEIVING THEM INTO THE BELIEF THAT SHE IS OF THE HIGHEST VALUE TO THEM
COOKERY SIMULATES THE DISGUISE OF MEDICINE AND PRETENDS TO KNOW WHAT
FOOD IS THE BEST FOR THE BODY AND IF THE PHYSICIAN AND THE COOK HAD TO
ENTER INTO A COMPETITION IN WHICH CHILDREN WERE THE JUDGES OR MEN WHO
HAD NO MORE SENSE THAN CHILDREN AS TO WHICH OF THEM BEST UNDERSTANDS
THE GOODNESS OR BADNESS OF FOOD THE PHYSICIAN WOULD BE STARVED TO
DEATH
A FLATTERY I DEEM THIS TO BE AND OF AN IGNOBLE SORT POLUS FOR
TO YOU I AM NOW ADDRESSING MYSELF BECAUSE IT AIMS AT PLEASURE
WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT OF THE BEST
AN ART I DO NOT CALL IT BUT ONLY AN
EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT IS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN OR TO GIVE A REASON OF THE
NATURE OF ITS OWN APPLICATIONS
AND I DO NOT CALL ANY IRRATIONAL THING
AN ART BUT IF YOU DISPUTE MY WORDS I AM PREPARED TO ARGUE IN DEFENCE
OF THEM
COOKERY THEN I MAINTAIN TO BE A FLATTERY WHICH TAKES THE FORM OF
MEDICINE AND TIRING IN LIKE MANNER IS A FLATTERY WHICH TAKES THE
FORM OF GYMNASTIC AND IS KNAVISH FALSE IGNOBLE ILLIBERAL WORKING
DECEITFULLY BY THE HELP OF LINES AND COLOURS AND ENAMELS AND
GARMENTS AND MAKING MEN AFFECT A SPURIOUS BEAUTY TO THE NEGLECT OF THE
TRUE BEAUTY WHICH IS GIVEN BY GYMNASTIC
I WOULD RATHER NOT BE TEDIOUS AND THEREFORE I WILL ONLY SAY AFTER THE
MANNER OF THE GEOMETRICIANS FOR I THINK THAT BY THIS TIME YOU WILL BE
ABLE TO FOLLOW
AS TIRING GYMNASTIC COOKERY MEDICINE
OR RATHER
AS TIRING GYMNASTIC SOPHISTRY LEGISLATION
AND
AS COOKERY MEDICINE RHETORIC JUSTICE
AND THIS I SAY IS THE NATURAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RHETORICIAN AND
THE SOPHIST BUT BY REASON OF THEIR NEAR CONNECTION THEY ARE APT TO BE
JUMBLED UP TOGETHER NEITHER DO THEY KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THEMSELVES
NOR DO OTHER MEN KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THEM
FOR IF THE BODY PRESIDED
OVER ITSELF AND WERE NOT UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE SOUL AND THE SOUL
DID NOT DISCERN AND DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN COOKERY AND MEDICINE BUT THE
BODY WAS MADE THE JUDGE OF THEM AND THE RULE OF JUDGMENT WAS THE BODILY
DELIGHT WHICH WAS GIVEN BY THEM THEN THE WORD OF ANAXAGORAS THAT WORD
WITH WHICH YOU FRIEND POLUS ARE SO WELL ACQUAINTED WOULD PREVAIL FAR
AND WIDE 'CHAOS' WOULD COME AGAIN AND COOKERY HEALTH AND MEDICINE
WOULD MINGLE IN AN INDISCRIMINATE MASS
AND NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU MY
NOTION OF RHETORIC WHICH IS IN RELATION TO THE SOUL WHAT COOKERY IS
TO THE BODY
I MAY HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT IN MAKING A LONG SPEECH WHEN
I WOULD NOT ALLOW YOU TO DISCOURSE AT LENGTH
BUT I THINK THAT I MAY BE
EXCUSED BECAUSE YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND ME AND COULD MAKE NO USE OF
MY ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE SHORTLY AND THEREFORE I HAD TO ENTER INTO AN
EXPLANATION
AND IF I SHOW AN EQUAL INABILITY TO MAKE USE OF YOURS I
HOPE THAT YOU WILL SPEAK AT EQUAL LENGTH BUT IF I AM ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
YOU LET ME HAVE THE BENEFIT OF YOUR BREVITY AS IS ONLY FAIR AND NOW
YOU MAY DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH MY ANSWER
POLUS WHAT DO YOU MEAN DO YOU THINK THAT RHETORIC IS FLATTERY
SOCRATES NAY I SAID A PART OF FLATTERY IF AT YOUR AGE POLUS YOU
CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT WILL YOU DO BY AND BY WHEN YOU GET OLDER
POLUS AND ARE THE GOOD RHETORICIANS MEANLY REGARDED IN STATES UNDER
THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE FLATTERERS
SOCRATES IS THAT A QUESTION OR THE BEGINNING OF A SPEECH
POLUS I AM ASKING A QUESTION
SOCRATES THEN MY ANSWER IS THAT THEY ARE NOT REGARDED AT ALL
POLUS HOW NOT REGARDED HAVE THEY NOT VERY GREAT POWER IN STATES
SOCRATES NOT IF YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT POWER IS A GOOD TO THE POSSESSOR
POLUS AND THAT IS WHAT I DO MEAN TO SAY
SOCRATES THEN IF SO I THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE LEAST POWER OF ALL THE
CITIZENS
POLUS WHAT ARE THEY NOT LIKE TYRANTS THEY KILL AND DESPOIL AND EXILE
ANY ONE WHOM THEY PLEASE
SOCRATES BY THE DOG POLUS I CANNOT MAKE OUT AT EACH DELIVERANCE
OF YOURS WHETHER YOU ARE GIVING AN OPINION OF YOUR OWN OR ASKING A
QUESTION OF ME
POLUS I AM ASKING A QUESTION OF YOU
SOCRATES YES MY FRIEND BUT YOU ASK TWO QUESTIONS AT ONCE
POLUS HOW TWO QUESTIONS
SOCRATES WHY DID YOU NOT SAY JUST NOW THAT THE RHETORICIANS ARE LIKE
TYRANTS AND THAT THEY KILL AND DESPOIL OR EXILE ANY ONE WHOM THEY
PLEASE
POLUS I DID
SOCRATES WELL THEN I SAY TO YOU THAT HERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS IN ONE
AND I WILL ANSWER BOTH OF THEM
AND I TELL YOU POLUS THAT RHETORICIANS
AND TYRANTS HAVE THE LEAST POSSIBLE POWER IN STATES AS I WAS JUST NOW
SAYING FOR THEY DO LITERALLY NOTHING WHICH THEY WILL BUT ONLY WHAT
THEY THINK BEST
POLUS AND IS NOT THAT A GREAT POWER
SOCRATES POLUS HAS ALREADY SAID THE REVERSE
POLUS SAID THE REVERSE NAY THAT IS WHAT I ASSERT
SOCRATES NO BY THE GREAT WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM NOT YOU FOR YOU SAY
THAT POWER IS A GOOD TO HIM WHO HAS THE POWER
POLUS I DO
SOCRATES AND WOULD YOU MAINTAIN THAT IF A FOOL DOES WHAT HE THINKS
BEST THIS IS A GOOD AND WOULD YOU CALL THIS GREAT POWER
POLUS I SHOULD NOT
SOCRATES THEN YOU MUST PROVE THAT THE RHETORICIAN IS NOT A FOOL AND
THAT RHETORIC IS AN ART AND NOT A FLATTERY AND SO YOU WILL HAVE REFUTED
ME BUT IF YOU LEAVE ME UNREFUTED WHY THE RHETORICIANS WHO DO WHAT
THEY THINK BEST IN STATES AND THE TYRANTS WILL HAVE NOTHING UPON
WHICH TO CONGRATULATE THEMSELVES IF AS YOU SAY POWER BE INDEED A GOOD
ADMITTING AT THE SAME TIME THAT WHAT IS DONE WITHOUT SENSE IS AN EVIL
POLUS YES I ADMIT THAT
SOCRATES HOW THEN CAN THE RHETORICIANS OR THE TYRANTS HAVE GREAT POWER
IN STATES UNLESS POLUS CAN REFUTE SOCRATES AND PROVE TO HIM THAT THEY
DO AS THEY WILL
POLUS THIS FELLOW
SOCRATES I SAY THAT THEY DO NOT DO AS THEY WILL NOW REFUTE ME
POLUS WHY HAVE YOU NOT ALREADY SAID THAT THEY DO AS THEY THINK BEST
SOCRATES AND I SAY SO STILL
POLUS THEN SURELY THEY DO AS THEY WILL
SOCRATES I DENY IT
POLUS BUT THEY DO WHAT THEY THINK BEST
SOCRATES AYE
POLUS THAT SOCRATES IS MONSTROUS AND ABSURD
SOCRATES GOOD WORDS GOOD POLUS AS I MAY SAY IN YOUR OWN PECULIAR
STYLE BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO ASK OF ME EITHER PROVE THAT I
AM IN ERROR OR GIVE THE ANSWER YOURSELF
POLUS VERY WELL I AM WILLING TO ANSWER THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
SOCRATES DO MEN APPEAR TO YOU TO WILL THAT WHICH THEY DO OR TO WILL
THAT FURTHER END FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH THEY DO A THING WHEN THEY TAKE
MEDICINE FOR EXAMPLE AT THE BIDDING OF A PHYSICIAN DO THEY WILL THE
DRINKING OF THE MEDICINE WHICH IS PAINFUL OR THE HEALTH FOR THE SAKE OF
WHICH THEY DRINK
POLUS CLEARLY THE HEALTH
SOCRATES AND WHEN MEN GO ON A VOYAGE OR ENGAGE IN BUSINESS THEY DO NOT
WILL THAT WHICH THEY ARE DOING AT THE TIME FOR WHO WOULD DESIRE TO TAKE
THE RISK OF A VOYAGE OR THE TROUBLE OF BUSINESS BUT THEY WILL TO HAVE
THE WEALTH FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH THEY GO ON A VOYAGE
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND IS NOT THIS UNIVERSALLY TRUE IF A MAN DOES SOMETHING FOR
THE SAKE OF SOMETHING ELSE HE WILLS NOT THAT WHICH HE DOES BUT THAT
FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH HE DOES IT
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND ARE NOT ALL THINGS EITHER GOOD OR EVIL OR INTERMEDIATE
AND INDIFFERENT
POLUS TO BE SURE SOCRATES
SOCRATES WISDOM AND HEALTH AND WEALTH AND THE LIKE YOU WOULD CALL
GOODS AND THEIR OPPOSITES EVILS
POLUS I SHOULD
SOCRATES AND THE THINGS WHICH ARE NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL AND WHICH
PARTAKE SOMETIMES OF THE NATURE OF GOOD AND AT OTHER TIMES OF EVIL OR
OF NEITHER ARE SUCH AS SITTING WALKING RUNNING SAILING OR AGAIN
WOOD STONES AND THE LIKE THESE ARE THE THINGS WHICH YOU CALL NEITHER
GOOD NOR EVIL
POLUS EXACTLY SO
SOCRATES ARE THESE INDIFFERENT THINGS DONE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD OR
THE GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF THE INDIFFERENT
POLUS CLEARLY THE INDIFFERENT FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD
SOCRATES WHEN WE WALK WE WALK FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD AND UNDER THE
IDEA THAT IT IS BETTER TO WALK AND WHEN WE STAND WE STAND EQUALLY FOR
THE SAKE OF THE GOOD
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND WHEN WE KILL A MAN WE KILL HIM OR EXILE HIM OR DESPOIL HIM
OF HIS GOODS BECAUSE AS WE THINK IT WILL CONDUCE TO OUR GOOD
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES MEN WHO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS DO THEM FOR THE SAKE OF THE
GOOD
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND DID WE NOT ADMIT THAT IN DOING SOMETHING FOR THE SAKE OF
SOMETHING ELSE WE DO NOT WILL THOSE THINGS WHICH WE DO BUT THAT OTHER
THING FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH WE DO THEM
POLUS MOST TRUE
SOCRATES THEN WE DO NOT WILL SIMPLY TO KILL A MAN OR TO EXILE HIM OR TO
DESPOIL HIM OF HIS GOODS BUT WE WILL TO DO THAT WHICH CONDUCES TO OUR
GOOD AND IF THE ACT IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO OUR GOOD WE DO NOT WILL IT FOR
WE WILL AS YOU SAY THAT WHICH IS OUR GOOD BUT THAT WHICH IS NEITHER
GOOD NOR EVIL OR SIMPLY EVIL WE DO NOT WILL
WHY ARE YOU SILENT
POLUS AM I NOT RIGHT
POLUS YOU ARE RIGHT
SOCRATES HENCE WE MAY INFER THAT IF ANY ONE WHETHER HE BE A TYRANT
OR A RHETORICIAN KILLS ANOTHER OR EXILES ANOTHER OR DEPRIVES HIM OF
HIS PROPERTY UNDER THE IDEA THAT THE ACT IS FOR HIS OWN INTERESTS WHEN
REALLY NOT FOR HIS OWN INTERESTS HE MAY BE SAID TO DO WHAT SEEMS BEST
TO HIM
POLUS YES
SOCRATES BUT DOES HE DO WHAT HE WILLS IF HE DOES WHAT IS EVIL WHY DO
YOU NOT ANSWER
POLUS WELL I SUPPOSE NOT
SOCRATES THEN IF GREAT POWER IS A GOOD AS YOU ALLOW WILL SUCH A ONE
HAVE GREAT POWER IN A STATE
POLUS HE WILL NOT
SOCRATES THEN I WAS RIGHT IN SAYING THAT A MAN MAY DO WHAT SEEMS GOOD
TO HIM IN A STATE AND NOT HAVE GREAT POWER AND NOT DO WHAT HE WILLS
POLUS AS THOUGH YOU SOCRATES WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE THE POWER OF
DOING WHAT SEEMED GOOD TO YOU IN THE STATE RATHER THAN NOT YOU WOULD
NOT BE JEALOUS WHEN YOU SAW ANY ONE KILLING OR DESPOILING OR IMPRISONING
WHOM HE PLEASED OH NO
SOCRATES JUSTLY OR UNJUSTLY DO YOU MEAN
POLUS IN EITHER CASE IS HE NOT EQUALLY TO BE ENVIED
SOCRATES FORBEAR POLUS
POLUS WHY 'FORBEAR'
SOCRATES BECAUSE YOU OUGHT NOT TO ENVY WRETCHES WHO ARE NOT TO BE
ENVIED BUT ONLY TO PITY THEM
POLUS AND ARE THOSE OF WHOM I SPOKE WRETCHES
SOCRATES YES CERTAINLY THEY ARE
POLUS AND SO YOU THINK THAT HE WHO SLAYS ANY ONE WHOM HE PLEASES AND
JUSTLY SLAYS HIM IS PITIABLE AND WRETCHED
SOCRATES NO I DO NOT SAY THAT OF HIM BUT NEITHER DO I THINK THAT HE
IS TO BE ENVIED
POLUS WERE YOU NOT SAYING JUST NOW THAT HE IS WRETCHED
SOCRATES YES MY FRIEND IF HE KILLED ANOTHER UNJUSTLY IN WHICH CASE
HE IS ALSO TO BE PITIED AND HE IS NOT TO BE ENVIED IF HE KILLED HIM
JUSTLY
POLUS AT ANY RATE YOU WILL ALLOW THAT HE WHO IS UNJUSTLY PUT TO DEATH
IS WRETCHED AND TO BE PITIED
SOCRATES NOT SO MUCH POLUS AS HE WHO KILLS HIM AND NOT SO MUCH AS HE
WHO IS JUSTLY KILLED
POLUS HOW CAN THAT BE SOCRATES
SOCRATES THAT MAY VERY WELL BE INASMUCH AS DOING INJUSTICE IS THE
GREATEST OF EVILS
POLUS BUT IS IT THE GREATEST IS NOT SUFFERING INJUSTICE A GREATER
EVIL
SOCRATES CERTAINLY NOT
POLUS THEN WOULD YOU RATHER SUFFER THAN DO INJUSTICE
SOCRATES I SHOULD NOT LIKE EITHER BUT IF I MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM I
WOULD RATHER SUFFER THAN DO
POLUS THEN YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE A TYRANT
SOCRATES NOT IF YOU MEAN BY TYRANNY WHAT I MEAN
POLUS I MEAN AS I SAID BEFORE THE POWER OF DOING WHATEVER SEEMS GOOD
TO YOU IN A STATE KILLING BANISHING DOING IN ALL THINGS AS YOU LIKE
SOCRATES WELL THEN ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND WHEN I HAVE SAID MY SAY DO YOU
REPLY TO ME
SUPPOSE THAT I GO INTO A CROWDED AGORA AND TAKE A DAGGER
UNDER MY ARM
POLUS I SAY TO YOU I HAVE JUST ACQUIRED RARE POWER AND
BECOME A TYRANT FOR IF I THINK THAT ANY OF THESE MEN WHOM YOU SEE OUGHT
TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE MAN WHOM I HAVE A MIND TO KILL IS AS GOOD AS
DEAD AND IF I AM DISPOSED TO BREAK HIS HEAD OR TEAR HIS GARMENT HE
WILL HAVE HIS HEAD BROKEN OR HIS GARMENT TORN IN AN INSTANT
SUCH IS MY
GREAT POWER IN THIS CITY
AND IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME AND I SHOW YOU
THE DAGGER YOU WOULD PROBABLY REPLY SOCRATES IN THAT SORT OF WAY ANY
ONE MAY HAVE GREAT POWER HE MAY BURN ANY HOUSE WHICH HE PLEASES AND
THE DOCKS AND TRIREMES OF THE ATHENIANS AND ALL THEIR OTHER VESSELS
WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BUT CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS MERE DOING AS
YOU THINK BEST IS GREAT POWER
POLUS CERTAINLY NOT SUCH DOING AS THIS
SOCRATES BUT CAN YOU TELL ME WHY YOU DISAPPROVE OF SUCH A POWER
POLUS I CAN
SOCRATES WHY THEN
POLUS WHY BECAUSE HE WHO DID AS YOU SAY WOULD BE CERTAIN TO BE
PUNISHED
SOCRATES AND PUNISHMENT IS AN EVIL
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND YOU WOULD ADMIT ONCE MORE MY GOOD SIR THAT GREAT POWER
IS A BENEFIT TO A MAN IF HIS ACTIONS TURN OUT TO HIS ADVANTAGE AND THAT
THIS IS THE MEANING OF GREAT POWER AND IF NOT THEN HIS POWER IS AN
EVIL AND IS NO POWER
BUT LET US LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER WAY DO
WE NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE THINGS OF WHICH WE WERE SPEAKING THE
INFLICTION OF DEATH AND EXILE AND THE DEPRIVATION OF PROPERTY ARE
SOMETIMES A GOOD AND SOMETIMES NOT A GOOD
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES ABOUT THAT YOU AND I MAY BE SUPPOSED TO AGREE
POLUS YES
SOCRATES TELL ME THEN WHEN DO YOU SAY THAT THEY ARE GOOD AND WHEN
THAT THEY ARE EVIL WHAT PRINCIPLE DO YOU LAY DOWN
POLUS I WOULD RATHER SOCRATES THAT YOU SHOULD ANSWER AS WELL AS ASK
THAT QUESTION
SOCRATES WELL POLUS SINCE YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE THE ANSWER FROM ME
I SAY THAT THEY ARE GOOD WHEN THEY ARE JUST AND EVIL WHEN THEY ARE
UNJUST
POLUS YOU ARE HARD OF REFUTATION SOCRATES BUT MIGHT NOT A CHILD
REFUTE THAT STATEMENT
SOCRATES THEN I SHALL BE VERY GRATEFUL TO THE CHILD AND EQUALLY
GRATEFUL TO YOU IF YOU WILL REFUTE ME AND DELIVER ME FROM MY
FOOLISHNESS
AND I HOPE THAT REFUTE ME YOU WILL AND NOT WEARY OF DOING
GOOD TO A FRIEND
POLUS YES SOCRATES AND I NEED NOT GO FAR OR APPEAL TO ANTIQUITY
EVENTS WHICH HAPPENED ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO ARE ENOUGH TO REFUTE YOU AND
TO PROVE THAT MANY MEN WHO DO WRONG ARE HAPPY
SOCRATES WHAT EVENTS
POLUS YOU SEE I PRESUME THAT ARCHELAUS THE SON OF PERDICCAS IS NOW
THE RULER OF MACEDONIA
SOCRATES AT ANY RATE I HEAR THAT HE IS
POLUS AND DO YOU THINK THAT HE IS HAPPY OR MISERABLE
SOCRATES I CANNOT SAY POLUS FOR I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE
WITH HIM
POLUS AND CANNOT YOU TELL AT ONCE AND WITHOUT HAVING AN ACQUAINTANCE
WITH HIM WHETHER A MAN IS HAPPY
SOCRATES MOST CERTAINLY NOT
POLUS THEN CLEARLY SOCRATES YOU WOULD SAY THAT YOU DID NOT EVEN KNOW
WHETHER THE GREAT KING WAS A HAPPY MAN
SOCRATES AND I SHOULD SPEAK THE TRUTH FOR I DO NOT KNOW HOW HE STANDS
IN THE MATTER OF EDUCATION AND JUSTICE
POLUS WHAT AND DOES ALL HAPPINESS CONSIST IN THIS
SOCRATES YES INDEED POLUS THAT IS MY DOCTRINE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO
ARE GENTLE AND GOOD ARE ALSO HAPPY AS I MAINTAIN AND THE UNJUST AND
EVIL ARE MISERABLE
POLUS THEN ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTRINE THE SAID ARCHELAUS IS
MISERABLE
SOCRATES YES MY FRIEND IF HE IS WICKED
POLUS THAT HE IS WICKED I CANNOT DENY FOR HE HAD NO TITLE AT ALL TO
THE THRONE WHICH HE NOW OCCUPIES HE BEING ONLY THE SON OF A WOMAN WHO
WAS THE SLAVE OF ALCETAS THE BROTHER OF PERDICCAS HE HIMSELF THEREFORE
IN STRICT RIGHT WAS THE SLAVE OF ALCETAS AND IF HE HAD MEANT TO DO
RIGHTLY HE WOULD HAVE REMAINED HIS SLAVE AND THEN ACCORDING TO YOUR
DOCTRINE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY
BUT NOW HE IS UNSPEAKABLY MISERABLE
FOR HE HAS BEEN GUILTY OF THE GREATEST CRIMES IN THE FIRST PLACE
HE INVITED HIS UNCLE AND MASTER ALCETAS TO COME TO HIM UNDER THE
PRETENCE THAT HE WOULD RESTORE TO HIM THE THRONE WHICH PERDICCAS HAS
USURPED AND AFTER ENTERTAINING HIM AND HIS SON ALEXANDER WHO WAS HIS
OWN COUSIN AND NEARLY OF AN AGE WITH HIM AND MAKING THEM DRUNK HE
THREW THEM INTO A WAGGON AND CARRIED THEM OFF BY NIGHT AND SLEW THEM
AND GOT BOTH OF THEM OUT OF THE WAY AND WHEN HE HAD DONE ALL THIS
WICKEDNESS HE NEVER DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS THE MOST MISERABLE OF ALL
MEN AND WAS VERY FAR FROM REPENTING SHALL I TELL YOU HOW HE SHOWED HIS
REMORSE HE HAD A YOUNGER BROTHER A CHILD OF SEVEN YEARS OLD WHO
WAS THE LEGITIMATE SON OF PERDICCAS AND TO HIM OF RIGHT THE KINGDOM
BELONGED ARCHELAUS HOWEVER HAD NO MIND TO BRING HIM UP AS HE OUGHT
AND RESTORE THE KINGDOM TO HIM THAT WAS NOT HIS NOTION OF HAPPINESS
BUT NOT LONG AFTERWARDS HE THREW HIM INTO A WELL AND DROWNED HIM AND
DECLARED TO HIS MOTHER CLEOPATRA THAT HE HAD FALLEN IN WHILE RUNNING
AFTER A GOOSE AND HAD BEEN KILLED
AND NOW AS HE IS THE GREATEST
CRIMINAL OF ALL THE MACEDONIANS HE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST
MISERABLE AND NOT THE HAPPIEST OF THEM AND I DARE SAY THAT THERE ARE
MANY ATHENIANS AND YOU WOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF THEM WHO WOULD RATHER
BE ANY OTHER MACEDONIAN THAN ARCHELAUS
SOCRATES I PRAISED YOU AT FIRST POLUS FOR BEING A RHETORICIAN RATHER
THAN A REASONER
AND THIS AS I SUPPOSE IS THE SORT OF ARGUMENT WITH
WHICH YOU FANCY THAT A CHILD MIGHT REFUTE ME AND BY WHICH I STAND
REFUTED WHEN I SAY THAT THE UNJUST MAN IS NOT HAPPY
BUT MY GOOD
FRIEND WHERE IS THE REFUTATION I CANNOT ADMIT A WORD WHICH YOU HAVE
BEEN SAYING
POLUS THAT IS BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT FOR YOU SURELY MUST THINK AS I DO
SOCRATES NOT SO MY SIMPLE FRIEND BUT BECAUSE YOU WILL REFUTE ME AFTER
THE MANNER WHICH RHETORICIANS PRACTISE IN COURTS OF LAW
FOR THERE THE
ONE PARTY THINK THAT THEY REFUTE THE OTHER WHEN THEY BRING FORWARD A
NUMBER OF WITNESSES OF GOOD REPUTE IN PROOF OF THEIR ALLEGATIONS AND
THEIR ADVERSARY HAS ONLY A SINGLE ONE OR NONE AT ALL
BUT THIS KIND OF
PROOF IS OF NO VALUE WHERE TRUTH IS THE AIM A MAN MAY OFTEN BE
SWORN DOWN BY A MULTITUDE OF FALSE WITNESSES WHO HAVE A GREAT AIR OF
RESPECTABILITY
AND IN THIS ARGUMENT NEARLY EVERY ONE ATHENIAN AND
STRANGER ALIKE WOULD BE ON YOUR SIDE IF YOU SHOULD BRING WITNESSES IN
DISPROOF OF MY STATEMENT YOU MAY IF YOU WILL SUMMON NICIAS THE SON
OF NICERATUS AND LET HIS BROTHERS WHO GAVE THE ROW OF TRIPODS WHICH
STAND IN THE PRECINCTS OF DIONYSUS COME WITH HIM OR YOU MAY SUMMON
ARISTOCRATES THE SON OF SCELLIUS WHO IS THE GIVER OF THAT FAMOUS
OFFERING WHICH IS AT DELPHI SUMMON IF YOU WILL THE WHOLE HOUSE OF
PERICLES OR ANY OTHER GREAT ATHENIAN FAMILY WHOM YOU CHOOSE THEY WILL
ALL AGREE WITH YOU I ONLY AM LEFT ALONE AND CANNOT AGREE FOR YOU DO
NOT CONVINCE ME ALTHOUGH YOU PRODUCE MANY FALSE WITNESSES AGAINST ME
IN THE HOPE OF DEPRIVING ME OF MY INHERITANCE WHICH IS THE TRUTH
BUT
I CONSIDER THAT NOTHING WORTH SPEAKING OF WILL HAVE BEEN EFFECTED BY ME
UNLESS I MAKE YOU THE ONE WITNESS OF MY WORDS NOR BY YOU UNLESS YOU
MAKE ME THE ONE WITNESS OF YOURS NO MATTER ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD
FOR THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF REFUTATION ONE WHICH IS YOURS AND THAT OF THE
WORLD IN GENERAL BUT MINE IS OF ANOTHER SORT LET US COMPARE THEM
AND SEE IN WHAT THEY DIFFER
FOR INDEED WE ARE AT ISSUE ABOUT MATTERS
WHICH TO KNOW IS HONOURABLE AND NOT TO KNOW DISGRACEFUL TO KNOW OR
NOT TO KNOW HAPPINESS AND MISERY THAT IS THE CHIEF OF THEM
AND WHAT
KNOWLEDGE CAN BE NOBLER OR WHAT IGNORANCE MORE DISGRACEFUL THAN THIS
AND THEREFORE I WILL BEGIN BY ASKING YOU WHETHER YOU DO NOT THINK THAT
A MAN WHO IS UNJUST AND DOING INJUSTICE CAN BE HAPPY SEEING THAT YOU
THINK ARCHELAUS UNJUST AND YET HAPPY MAY I ASSUME THIS TO BE YOUR
OPINION
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES BUT I SAY THAT THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY HERE IS ONE POINT
ABOUT WHICH WE ARE AT ISSUE VERY GOOD
AND DO YOU MEAN TO SAY ALSO
THAT IF HE MEETS WITH RETRIBUTION AND PUNISHMENT HE WILL STILL BE HAPPY
POLUS CERTAINLY NOT IN THAT CASE HE WILL BE MOST MISERABLE
SOCRATES ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE UNJUST BE NOT PUNISHED THEN
ACCORDING TO YOU HE WILL BE HAPPY
POLUS YES
SOCRATES BUT IN MY OPINION POLUS THE UNJUST OR DOER OF UNJUST
ACTIONS IS MISERABLE IN ANY CASE MORE MISERABLE HOWEVER IF HE BE NOT
PUNISHED AND DOES NOT MEET WITH RETRIBUTION AND LESS MISERABLE IF HE BE
PUNISHED AND MEETS WITH RETRIBUTION AT THE HANDS OF GODS AND MEN
POLUS YOU ARE MAINTAINING A STRANGE DOCTRINE SOCRATES
SOCRATES I SHALL TRY TO MAKE YOU AGREE WITH ME O MY FRIEND FOR AS A
FRIEND I REGARD YOU
THEN THESE ARE THE POINTS AT ISSUE BETWEEN US ARE
THEY NOT I WAS SAYING THAT TO DO IS WORSE THAN TO SUFFER INJUSTICE
POLUS EXACTLY SO
SOCRATES AND YOU SAID THE OPPOSITE
POLUS YES
SOCRATES I SAID ALSO THAT THE WICKED ARE MISERABLE AND YOU REFUTED ME
POLUS BY ZEUS I DID
SOCRATES IN YOUR OWN OPINION POLUS
POLUS YES AND I RATHER SUSPECT THAT I WAS IN THE RIGHT
SOCRATES YOU FURTHER SAID THAT THE WRONG DOER IS HAPPY IF HE BE
UNPUNISHED
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND I AFFIRM THAT HE IS MOST MISERABLE AND THAT THOSE WHO ARE
PUNISHED ARE LESS MISERABLE ARE YOU GOING TO REFUTE THIS PROPOSITION
ALSO
POLUS A PROPOSITION WHICH IS HARDER OF REFUTATION THAN THE OTHER
SOCRATES
SOCRATES SAY RATHER POLUS IMPOSSIBLE FOR WHO CAN REFUTE THE TRUTH
POLUS WHAT DO YOU MEAN IF A MAN IS DETECTED IN AN UNJUST ATTEMPT TO
MAKE HIMSELF A TYRANT AND WHEN DETECTED IS RACKED MUTILATED HAS
HIS EYES BURNED OUT AND AFTER HAVING HAD ALL SORTS OF GREAT INJURIES
INFLICTED ON HIM AND HAVING SEEN HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN SUFFER THE LIKE
IS AT LAST IMPALED OR TARRED AND BURNED ALIVE WILL HE BE HAPPIER THAN
IF HE ESCAPE AND BECOME A TYRANT AND CONTINUE ALL THROUGH LIFE
DOING WHAT HE LIKES AND HOLDING THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THE ENVY AND
ADMIRATION BOTH OF CITIZENS AND STRANGERS IS THAT THE PARADOX WHICH AS
YOU SAY CANNOT BE REFUTED
SOCRATES THERE AGAIN NOBLE POLUS YOU ARE RAISING HOBGOBLINS INSTEAD
OF REFUTING ME JUST NOW YOU WERE CALLING WITNESSES AGAINST ME
BUT
PLEASE TO REFRESH MY MEMORY A LITTLE DID YOU SAY 'IN AN UNJUST ATTEMPT
TO MAKE HIMSELF A TYRANT'
POLUS YES I DID
SOCRATES THEN I SAY THAT NEITHER OF THEM WILL BE HAPPIER THAN THE
OTHER NEITHER HE WHO UNJUSTLY ACQUIRES A TYRANNY NOR HE WHO SUFFERS
IN THE ATTEMPT FOR OF TWO MISERABLES ONE CANNOT BE THE HAPPIER BUT
THAT HE WHO ESCAPES AND BECOMES A TYRANT IS THE MORE MISERABLE OF THE
TWO
DO YOU LAUGH POLUS WELL THIS IS A NEW KIND OF REFUTATION WHEN
ANY ONE SAYS ANYTHING INSTEAD OF REFUTING HIM TO LAUGH AT HIM
POLUS BUT DO YOU NOT THINK SOCRATES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY
REFUTED WHEN YOU SAY THAT WHICH NO HUMAN BEING WILL ALLOW ASK THE
COMPANY
SOCRATES O POLUS I AM NOT A PUBLIC MAN AND ONLY LAST YEAR WHEN MY
TRIBE WERE SERVING AS PRYTANES AND IT BECAME MY DUTY AS THEIR PRESIDENT
TO TAKE THE VOTES THERE WAS A LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO TAKE
THEM
AND AS I FAILED THEN YOU MUST NOT ASK ME TO COUNT THE SUFFRAGES
OF THE COMPANY NOW BUT IF AS I WAS SAYING YOU HAVE NO BETTER ARGUMENT
THAN NUMBERS LET ME HAVE A TURN AND DO YOU MAKE TRIAL OF THE SORT OF
PROOF WHICH AS I THINK IS REQUIRED FOR I SHALL PRODUCE ONE WITNESS
ONLY OF THE TRUTH OF MY WORDS AND HE IS THE PERSON WITH WHOM I AM
ARGUING HIS SUFFRAGE I KNOW HOW TO TAKE BUT WITH THE MANY I HAVE
NOTHING TO DO AND DO NOT EVEN ADDRESS MYSELF TO THEM
MAY I ASK THEN
WHETHER YOU WILL ANSWER IN TURN AND HAVE YOUR WORDS PUT TO THE PROOF
FOR I CERTAINLY THINK THAT I AND YOU AND EVERY MAN DO REALLY BELIEVE
THAT TO DO IS A GREATER EVIL THAN TO SUFFER INJUSTICE AND NOT TO BE
PUNISHED THAN TO BE PUNISHED
POLUS AND I SHOULD SAY NEITHER I NOR ANY MAN WOULD YOU YOURSELF FOR
EXAMPLE SUFFER RATHER THAN DO INJUSTICE
SOCRATES YES AND YOU TOO I OR ANY MAN WOULD
POLUS QUITE THE REVERSE NEITHER YOU NOR I NOR ANY MAN
SOCRATES BUT WILL YOU ANSWER
POLUS TO BE SURE I WILL FOR I AM CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT YOU CAN HAVE TO
SAY
SOCRATES TELL ME THEN AND YOU WILL KNOW AND LET US SUPPOSE THAT I AM
BEGINNING AT THE BEGINNING WHICH OF THE TWO POLUS IN YOUR OPINION IS
THE WORST TO DO INJUSTICE OR TO SUFFER
POLUS I SHOULD SAY THAT SUFFERING WAS WORST
SOCRATES AND WHICH IS THE GREATER DISGRACE ANSWER
POLUS TO DO
SOCRATES AND THE GREATER DISGRACE IS THE GREATER EVIL
POLUS CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN THAT THE
HONOURABLE IS NOT THE SAME AS THE GOOD OR THE DISGRACEFUL AS THE EVIL
POLUS CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES LET ME ASK A QUESTION OF YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK OF BEAUTIFUL
THINGS SUCH AS BODIES COLOURS FIGURES SOUNDS INSTITUTIONS DO
YOU NOT CALL THEM BEAUTIFUL IN REFERENCE TO SOME STANDARD BODIES FOR
EXAMPLE ARE BEAUTIFUL IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE USEFUL OR AS THE SIGHT
OF THEM GIVES PLEASURE TO THE SPECTATORS CAN YOU GIVE ANY OTHER ACCOUNT
OF PERSONAL BEAUTY
POLUS I CANNOT
SOCRATES AND YOU WOULD SAY OF FIGURES OR COLOURS GENERALLY THAT THEY
WERE BEAUTIFUL EITHER BY REASON OF THE PLEASURE WHICH THEY GIVE OR OF
THEIR USE OR OF BOTH
POLUS YES I SHOULD
SOCRATES AND YOU WOULD CALL SOUNDS AND MUSIC BEAUTIFUL FOR THE SAME
REASON
POLUS I SHOULD
SOCRATES LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS ALSO HAVE NO BEAUTY IN THEM EXCEPT IN SO
FAR AS THEY ARE USEFUL OR PLEASANT OR BOTH
POLUS I THINK NOT
SOCRATES AND MAY NOT THE SAME BE SAID OF THE BEAUTY OF KNOWLEDGE
POLUS TO BE SURE SOCRATES AND I VERY MUCH APPROVE OF YOUR MEASURING
BEAUTY BY THE STANDARD OF PLEASURE AND UTILITY
SOCRATES AND DEFORMITY OR DISGRACE MAY BE EQUALLY MEASURED BY THE
OPPOSITE STANDARD OF PAIN AND EVIL
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THEN WHEN OF TWO BEAUTIFUL THINGS ONE EXCEEDS IN BEAUTY THE
MEASURE OF THE EXCESS IS TO BE TAKEN IN ONE OR BOTH OF THESE THAT IS TO
SAY IN PLEASURE OR UTILITY OR BOTH
POLUS VERY TRUE
SOCRATES AND OF TWO DEFORMED THINGS THAT WHICH EXCEEDS IN DEFORMITY OR
DISGRACE EXCEEDS EITHER IN PAIN OR EVIL MUST IT NOT BE SO
POLUS YES
SOCRATES BUT THEN AGAIN WHAT WAS THE OBSERVATION WHICH YOU JUST NOW
MADE ABOUT DOING AND SUFFERING WRONG DID YOU NOT SAY THAT SUFFERING
WRONG WAS MORE EVIL AND DOING WRONG MORE DISGRACEFUL
POLUS I DID
SOCRATES THEN IF DOING WRONG IS MORE DISGRACEFUL THAN SUFFERING THE
MORE DISGRACEFUL MUST BE MORE PAINFUL AND MUST EXCEED IN PAIN OR IN EVIL
OR BOTH DOES NOT THAT ALSO FOLLOW
POLUS OF COURSE
SOCRATES FIRST THEN LET US CONSIDER WHETHER THE DOING OF INJUSTICE
EXCEEDS THE SUFFERING IN THE CONSEQUENT PAIN DO THE INJURERS SUFFER
MORE THAN THE INJURED
POLUS NO SOCRATES CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES THEN THEY DO NOT EXCEED IN PAIN
POLUS NO
SOCRATES BUT IF NOT IN PAIN THEN NOT IN BOTH
POLUS CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES THEN THEY CAN ONLY EXCEED IN THE OTHER
POLUS YES
SOCRATES THAT IS TO SAY IN EVIL
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES THEN DOING INJUSTICE WILL HAVE AN EXCESS OF EVIL AND WILL
THEREFORE BE A GREATER EVIL THAN SUFFERING INJUSTICE
POLUS CLEARLY
SOCRATES BUT HAVE NOT YOU AND THE WORLD ALREADY AGREED THAT TO DO
INJUSTICE IS MORE DISGRACEFUL THAN TO SUFFER
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND THAT IS NOW DISCOVERED TO BE MORE EVIL
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND WOULD YOU PREFER A GREATER EVIL OR A GREATER DISHONOUR TO
A LESS ONE ANSWER POLUS AND FEAR NOT FOR YOU WILL COME TO NO HARM IF
YOU NOBLY RESIGN YOURSELF INTO THE HEALING HAND OF THE ARGUMENT AS TO A
PHYSICIAN WITHOUT SHRINKING AND EITHER SAY 'YES' OR 'NO' TO ME
POLUS I SHOULD SAY 'NO
SOCRATES WOULD ANY OTHER MAN PREFER A GREATER TO A LESS EVIL
POLUS NO NOT ACCORDING TO THIS WAY OF PUTTING THE CASE SOCRATES
SOCRATES THEN I SAID TRULY POLUS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR I NOR ANY
MAN WOULD RATHER DO THAN SUFFER INJUSTICE FOR TO DO INJUSTICE IS THE
GREATER EVIL OF THE TWO
POLUS THAT IS THE CONCLUSION
SOCRATES YOU SEE POLUS WHEN YOU COMPARE THE TWO KINDS OF REFUTATIONS
HOW UNLIKE THEY ARE
ALL MEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF ARE OF
YOUR WAY OF THINKING BUT YOUR SINGLE ASSENT AND WITNESS ARE ENOUGH
FOR ME I HAVE NO NEED OF ANY OTHER I TAKE YOUR SUFFRAGE AND AM
REGARDLESS OF THE REST
ENOUGH OF THIS AND NOW LET US PROCEED TO THE
NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS WHETHER THE GREATEST OF EVILS TO A GUILTY
MAN IS TO SUFFER PUNISHMENT AS YOU SUPPOSED OR WHETHER TO ESCAPE
PUNISHMENT IS NOT A GREATER EVIL AS I SUPPOSED
CONSIDER YOU WOULD
SAY THAT TO SUFFER PUNISHMENT IS ANOTHER NAME FOR BEING JUSTLY CORRECTED
WHEN YOU DO WRONG
POLUS I SHOULD
SOCRATES AND WOULD YOU NOT ALLOW THAT ALL JUST THINGS ARE HONOURABLE IN
SO FAR AS THEY ARE JUST PLEASE TO REFLECT AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION
POLUS YES SOCRATES I THINK THAT THEY ARE
SOCRATES CONSIDER AGAIN WHERE THERE IS AN AGENT MUST THERE NOT ALSO
BE A PATIENT
POLUS I SHOULD SAY SO
SOCRATES AND WILL NOT THE PATIENT SUFFER THAT WHICH THE AGENT DOES
AND WILL NOT THE SUFFERING HAVE THE QUALITY OF THE ACTION I MEAN
FOR EXAMPLE THAT IF A MAN STRIKES THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WHICH IS
STRICKEN
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND IF THE STRIKER STRIKES VIOLENTLY OR QUICKLY THAT WHICH IS
STRUCK WILL BE STRUCK VIOLENTLY OR QUICKLY
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND THE SUFFERING TO HIM WHO IS STRICKEN IS OF THE SAME NATURE
AS THE ACT OF HIM WHO STRIKES
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND IF A MAN BURNS THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH IS BURNED
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND IF HE BURNS IN EXCESS OR SO AS TO CAUSE PAIN THE THING
BURNED WILL BE BURNED IN THE SAME WAY
POLUS TRULY
SOCRATES AND IF HE CUTS THE SAME ARGUMENT HOLDS THERE WILL BE
SOMETHING CUT
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND IF THE CUTTING BE GREAT OR DEEP OR SUCH AS WILL CAUSE
PAIN THE CUT WILL BE OF THE SAME NATURE
POLUS THAT IS EVIDENT
SOCRATES THEN YOU WOULD AGREE GENERALLY TO THE UNIVERSAL PROPOSITION
WHICH I WAS JUST NOW ASSERTING THAT THE AFFECTION OF THE PATIENT
ANSWERS TO THE AFFECTION OF THE AGENT
POLUS I AGREE
SOCRATES THEN AS THIS IS ADMITTED LET ME ASK WHETHER BEING PUNISHED
IS SUFFERING OR ACTING
POLUS SUFFERING SOCRATES THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THAT
SOCRATES AND SUFFERING IMPLIES AN AGENT
POLUS CERTAINLY SOCRATES AND HE IS THE PUNISHER
SOCRATES AND HE WHO PUNISHES RIGHTLY PUNISHES JUSTLY
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND THEREFORE HE ACTS JUSTLY
POLUS JUSTLY
SOCRATES THEN HE WHO IS PUNISHED AND SUFFERS RETRIBUTION SUFFERS
JUSTLY
POLUS THAT IS EVIDENT
SOCRATES AND THAT WHICH IS JUST HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE HONOURABLE
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THEN THE PUNISHER DOES WHAT IS HONOURABLE AND THE PUNISHED
SUFFERS WHAT IS HONOURABLE
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND IF WHAT IS HONOURABLE THEN WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE
HONOURABLE IS EITHER PLEASANT OR USEFUL
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THEN HE WHO IS PUNISHED SUFFERS WHAT IS GOOD
POLUS THAT IS TRUE
SOCRATES THEN HE IS BENEFITED
POLUS YES
SOCRATES DO I UNDERSTAND YOU TO MEAN WHAT I MEAN BY THE TERM
'BENEFITED' I MEAN THAT IF HE BE JUSTLY PUNISHED HIS SOUL IS IMPROVED
POLUS SURELY
SOCRATES THEN HE WHO IS PUNISHED IS DELIVERED FROM THE EVIL OF HIS
SOUL
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND IS HE NOT THEN DELIVERED FROM THE GREATEST EVIL LOOK AT
THE MATTER IN THIS WAY IN RESPECT OF A MAN'S ESTATE DO YOU SEE ANY
GREATER EVIL THAN POVERTY
POLUS THERE IS NO GREATER EVIL
SOCRATES AGAIN IN A MAN'S BODILY FRAME YOU WOULD SAY THAT THE EVIL IS
WEAKNESS AND DISEASE AND DEFORMITY
POLUS I SHOULD
SOCRATES AND DO YOU NOT IMAGINE THAT THE SOUL LIKEWISE HAS SOME EVIL OF
HER OWN
POLUS OF COURSE
SOCRATES AND THIS YOU WOULD CALL INJUSTICE AND IGNORANCE AND COWARDICE
AND THE LIKE
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES SO THEN IN MIND BODY AND ESTATE WHICH ARE THREE YOU HAVE
POINTED OUT THREE CORRESPONDING EVILS INJUSTICE DISEASE POVERTY
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND WHICH OF THE EVILS IS THE MOST DISGRACEFUL IS NOT THE
MOST DISGRACEFUL OF THEM INJUSTICE AND IN GENERAL THE EVIL OF THE SOUL
POLUS BY FAR THE MOST
SOCRATES AND IF THE MOST DISGRACEFUL THEN ALSO THE WORST
POLUS WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOCRATES
SOCRATES I MEAN TO SAY THAT IS MOST DISGRACEFUL HAS BEEN ALREADY
ADMITTED TO BE MOST PAINFUL OR HURTFUL OR BOTH
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND NOW INJUSTICE AND ALL EVIL IN THE SOUL HAS BEEN ADMITTED
BY US TO BE MOST DISGRACEFUL
POLUS IT HAS BEEN ADMITTED
SOCRATES AND MOST DISGRACEFUL EITHER BECAUSE MOST PAINFUL AND CAUSING
EXCESSIVE PAIN OR MOST HURTFUL OR BOTH
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND THEREFORE TO BE UNJUST AND INTEMPERATE AND COWARDLY AND
IGNORANT IS MORE PAINFUL THAN TO BE POOR AND SICK
POLUS NAY SOCRATES THE PAINFULNESS DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO FOLLOW
FROM YOUR PREMISES
SOCRATES THEN IF AS YOU WOULD ARGUE NOT MORE PAINFUL THE EVIL
OF THE SOUL IS OF ALL EVILS THE MOST DISGRACEFUL AND THE EXCESS
OF DISGRACE MUST BE CAUSED BY SOME PRETERNATURAL GREATNESS OR
EXTRAORDINARY HURTFULNESS OF THE EVIL
POLUS CLEARLY
SOCRATES AND THAT WHICH EXCEEDS MOST IN HURTFULNESS WILL BE THE
GREATEST OF EVILS
POLUS YES
SOCRATES THEN INJUSTICE AND INTEMPERANCE AND IN GENERAL THE DEPRAVITY
OF THE SOUL ARE THE GREATEST OF EVILS
POLUS THAT IS EVIDENT
SOCRATES NOW WHAT ART IS THERE WHICH DELIVERS US FROM POVERTY DOES
NOT THE ART OF MAKING MONEY
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND WHAT ART FREES US FROM DISEASE DOES NOT THE ART OF
MEDICINE
POLUS VERY TRUE
SOCRATES AND WHAT FROM VICE AND INJUSTICE IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO
ANSWER AT ONCE ASK YOURSELF WHITHER WE GO WITH THE SICK AND TO WHOM WE
TAKE THEM
POLUS TO THE PHYSICIANS SOCRATES
SOCRATES AND TO WHOM DO WE GO WITH THE UNJUST AND INTEMPERATE
POLUS TO THE JUDGES YOU MEAN
SOCRATES WHO ARE TO PUNISH THEM
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND DO NOT THOSE WHO RIGHTLY PUNISH OTHERS PUNISH THEM IN
ACCORDANCE WITH A CERTAIN RULE OF JUSTICE
POLUS CLEARLY
SOCRATES THEN THE ART OF MONEY MAKING FREES A MAN FROM POVERTY
MEDICINE FROM DISEASE AND JUSTICE FROM INTEMPERANCE AND INJUSTICE
POLUS THAT IS EVIDENT
SOCRATES WHICH THEN IS THE BEST OF THESE THREE
POLUS WILL YOU ENUMERATE THEM
SOCRATES MONEY MAKING MEDICINE AND JUSTICE
POLUS JUSTICE SOCRATES FAR EXCELS THE TWO OTHERS
SOCRATES AND JUSTICE IF THE BEST GIVES THE GREATEST PLEASURE OR
ADVANTAGE OR BOTH
POLUS YES
SOCRATES BUT IS THE BEING HEALED A PLEASANT THING AND ARE THOSE WHO
ARE BEING HEALED PLEASED
POLUS I THINK NOT
SOCRATES A USEFUL THING THEN
POLUS YES
SOCRATES YES BECAUSE THE PATIENT IS DELIVERED FROM A GREAT EVIL AND
THIS IS THE ADVANTAGE OF ENDURING THE PAIN THAT YOU GET WELL
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND WOULD HE BE THE HAPPIER MAN IN HIS BODILY CONDITION WHO
IS HEALED OR WHO NEVER WAS OUT OF HEALTH
POLUS CLEARLY HE WHO WAS NEVER OUT OF HEALTH
SOCRATES YES FOR HAPPINESS SURELY DOES NOT CONSIST IN BEING DELIVERED
FROM EVILS BUT IN NEVER HAVING HAD THEM
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND SUPPOSE THE CASE OF TWO PERSONS WHO HAVE SOME EVIL IN
THEIR BODIES AND THAT ONE OF THEM IS HEALED AND DELIVERED FROM EVIL
AND ANOTHER IS NOT HEALED BUT RETAINS THE EVIL WHICH OF THEM IS THE
MOST MISERABLE
POLUS CLEARLY HE WHO IS NOT HEALED
SOCRATES AND WAS NOT PUNISHMENT SAID BY US TO BE A DELIVERANCE FROM THE
GREATEST OF EVILS WHICH IS VICE
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND JUSTICE PUNISHES US AND MAKES US MORE JUST AND IS THE
MEDICINE OF OUR VICE
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES HE THEN HAS THE FIRST PLACE IN THE SCALE OF HAPPINESS
WHO HAS NEVER HAD VICE IN HIS SOUL FOR THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE
GREATEST OF EVILS
POLUS CLEARLY
SOCRATES AND HE HAS THE SECOND PLACE WHO IS DELIVERED FROM VICE
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES THAT IS TO SAY HE WHO RECEIVES ADMONITION AND REBUKE AND
PUNISHMENT
POLUS YES
SOCRATES THEN HE LIVES WORST WHO HAVING BEEN UNJUST HAS NO
DELIVERANCE FROM INJUSTICE
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THAT IS HE LIVES WORST WHO COMMITS THE GREATEST CRIMES
AND WHO BEING THE MOST UNJUST OF MEN SUCCEEDS IN ESCAPING REBUKE OR
CORRECTION OR PUNISHMENT AND THIS AS YOU SAY HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED
BY ARCHELAUS AND OTHER TYRANTS AND RHETORICIANS AND POTENTATES COMPARE
REPUBLIC
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES MAY NOT THEIR WAY OF PROCEEDING MY FRIEND BE COMPARED TO THE
CONDUCT OF A PERSON WHO IS AFFLICTED WITH THE WORST OF DISEASES AND YET
CONTRIVES NOT TO PAY THE PENALTY TO THE PHYSICIAN FOR HIS SINS AGAINST
HIS CONSTITUTION AND WILL NOT BE CURED BECAUSE LIKE A CHILD HE IS
AFRAID OF THE PAIN OF BEING BURNED OR CUT IS NOT THAT A PARALLEL CASE
POLUS YES TRULY
SOCRATES HE WOULD SEEM AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE NATURE OF HEALTH AND
BODILY VIGOUR AND IF WE ARE RIGHT POLUS IN OUR PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS
THEY ARE IN A LIKE CASE WHO STRIVE TO EVADE JUSTICE WHICH THEY SEE TO
BE PAINFUL BUT ARE BLIND TO THE ADVANTAGE WHICH ENSUES FROM IT NOT
KNOWING HOW FAR MORE MISERABLE A COMPANION A DISEASED SOUL IS THAN
A DISEASED BODY A SOUL I SAY WHICH IS CORRUPT AND UNRIGHTEOUS AND
UNHOLY
AND HENCE THEY DO ALL THAT THEY CAN TO AVOID PUNISHMENT AND TO
AVOID BEING RELEASED FROM THE GREATEST OF EVILS THEY PROVIDE THEMSELVES
WITH MONEY AND FRIENDS AND CULTIVATE TO THE UTMOST THEIR POWERS OF
PERSUASION
BUT IF WE POLUS ARE RIGHT DO YOU SEE WHAT FOLLOWS OR
SHALL WE DRAW OUT THE CONSEQUENCES IN FORM
POLUS IF YOU PLEASE
SOCRATES IS IT NOT A FACT THAT INJUSTICE AND THE DOING OF INJUSTICE
IS THE GREATEST OF EVILS
POLUS THAT IS QUITE CLEAR
SOCRATES AND FURTHER THAT TO SUFFER PUNISHMENT IS THE WAY TO BE
RELEASED FROM THIS EVIL
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND NOT TO SUFFER IS TO PERPETUATE THE EVIL
POLUS YES
SOCRATES TO DO WRONG THEN IS SECOND ONLY IN THE SCALE OF EVILS BUT
TO DO WRONG AND NOT TO BE PUNISHED IS FIRST AND GREATEST OF ALL
POLUS THAT IS TRUE
SOCRATES WELL AND WAS NOT THIS THE POINT IN DISPUTE MY FRIEND
YOU DEEMED ARCHELAUS HAPPY BECAUSE HE WAS A VERY GREAT CRIMINAL AND
UNPUNISHED I ON THE OTHER HAND MAINTAINED THAT HE OR ANY OTHER WHO
LIKE HIM HAS DONE WRONG AND HAS NOT BEEN PUNISHED IS AND OUGHT TO BE
THE MOST MISERABLE OF ALL MEN AND THAT THE DOER OF INJUSTICE IS
MORE MISERABLE THAN THE SUFFERER AND HE WHO ESCAPES PUNISHMENT MORE
MISERABLE THAN HE WHO SUFFERS WAS NOT THAT WHAT I SAID
POLUS YES
SOCRATES AND IT HAS BEEN PROVED TO BE TRUE
POLUS CERTAINLY
SOCRATES WELL POLUS BUT IF THIS IS TRUE WHERE IS THE GREAT USE OF
RHETORIC IF WE ADMIT WHAT HAS BEEN JUST NOW SAID EVERY MAN OUGHT IN
EVERY WAY TO GUARD HIMSELF AGAINST DOING WRONG FOR HE WILL THEREBY
SUFFER GREAT EVIL
POLUS TRUE
SOCRATES AND IF HE OR ANY ONE ABOUT WHOM HE CARES DOES WRONG HE
OUGHT OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO GO WHERE HE WILL BE IMMEDIATELY PUNISHED HE
WILL RUN TO THE JUDGE AS HE WOULD TO THE PHYSICIAN IN ORDER THAT
THE DISEASE OF INJUSTICE MAY NOT BE RENDERED CHRONIC AND BECOME THE
INCURABLE CANCER OF THE SOUL MUST WE NOT ALLOW THIS CONSEQUENCE
POLUS IF OUR FORMER ADMISSIONS ARE TO STAND IS ANY OTHER INFERENCE
CONSISTENT WITH THEM
POLUS TO THAT SOCRATES THERE CAN BE BUT ONE ANSWER
SOCRATES THEN RHETORIC IS OF NO USE TO US POLUS IN HELPING A MAN TO
EXCUSE HIS OWN INJUSTICE THAT OF HIS PARENTS OR FRIENDS OR CHILDREN OR
COUNTRY BUT MAY BE OF USE TO ANY ONE WHO HOLDS THAT INSTEAD OF EXCUSING
HE OUGHT TO ACCUSE HIMSELF ABOVE ALL AND IN THE NEXT DEGREE HIS FAMILY
OR ANY OF HIS FRIENDS WHO MAY BE DOING WRONG HE SHOULD BRING TO LIGHT
THE INIQUITY AND NOT CONCEAL IT THAT SO THE WRONG DOER MAY SUFFER
AND BE MADE WHOLE AND HE SHOULD EVEN FORCE HIMSELF AND OTHERS NOT TO
SHRINK BUT WITH CLOSED EYES LIKE BRAVE MEN TO LET THE PHYSICIAN OPERATE
WITH KNIFE OR SEARING IRON NOT REGARDING THE PAIN IN THE HOPE OF
ATTAINING THE GOOD AND THE HONOURABLE LET HIM WHO HAS DONE THINGS
WORTHY OF STRIPES ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE SCOURGED IF OF BONDS TO BE
BOUND IF OF A FINE TO BE FINED IF OF EXILE TO BE EXILED IF OF
DEATH TO DIE HIMSELF BEING THE FIRST TO ACCUSE HIMSELF AND HIS OWN
RELATIONS AND USING RHETORIC TO THIS END THAT HIS AND THEIR UNJUST
ACTIONS MAY BE MADE MANIFEST AND THAT THEY THEMSELVES MAY BE DELIVERED
FROM INJUSTICE WHICH IS THE GREATEST EVIL
THEN POLUS RHETORIC WOULD
INDEED BE USEFUL
DO YOU SAY 'YES' OR 'NO' TO THAT
POLUS TO ME SOCRATES WHAT YOU ARE SAYING APPEARS VERY STRANGE THOUGH
PROBABLY IN AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PREMISES
SOCRATES IS NOT THIS THE CONCLUSION IF THE PREMISES ARE NOT DISPROVEN
POLUS YES IT CERTAINLY IS
SOCRATES AND FROM THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW IF INDEED IT BE OUR
DUTY TO HARM ANOTHER WHETHER AN ENEMY OR NOT I EXCEPT THE CASE OF
SELF DEFENCE THEN I HAVE TO BE UPON MY GUARD BUT IF MY ENEMY INJURES
A THIRD PERSON THEN IN EVERY SORT OF WAY BY WORD AS WELL AS DEED I
SHOULD TRY TO PREVENT HIS BEING PUNISHED OR APPEARING BEFORE THE JUDGE
AND IF HE APPEARS I SHOULD CONTRIVE THAT HE SHOULD ESCAPE AND NOT
SUFFER PUNISHMENT IF HE HAS STOLEN A SUM OF MONEY LET HIM KEEP WHAT
HE HAS STOLEN AND SPEND IT ON HIM AND HIS REGARDLESS OF RELIGION AND
JUSTICE AND IF HE HAVE DONE THINGS WORTHY OF DEATH LET HIM NOT DIE
BUT RATHER BE IMMORTAL IN HIS WICKEDNESS OR IF THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE
LET HIM AT ANY RATE BE ALLOWED TO LIVE AS LONG AS HE CAN
FOR SUCH
PURPOSES POLUS RHETORIC MAY BE USEFUL BUT IS OF SMALL IF OF ANY USE
TO HIM WHO IS NOT INTENDING TO COMMIT INJUSTICE AT LEAST THERE WAS NO
SUCH USE DISCOVERED BY US IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
CALLICLES TELL ME CHAEREPHON IS SOCRATES IN EARNEST OR IS HE JOKING
CHAEREPHON I SHOULD SAY CALLICLES THAT HE IS IN MOST PROFOUND
EARNEST BUT YOU MAY WELL ASK HIM
CALLICLES BY THE GODS AND I WILL
TELL ME SOCRATES ARE YOU IN
EARNEST OR ONLY IN JEST FOR IF YOU ARE IN EARNEST AND WHAT YOU SAY IS
TRUE IS NOT THE WHOLE OF HUMAN LIFE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND ARE WE NOT
DOING AS WOULD APPEAR IN EVERYTHING THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE OUGHT TO
BE DOING
SOCRATES O CALLICLES IF THERE WERE NOT SOME COMMUNITY OF FEELINGS
AMONG MANKIND HOWEVER VARYING IN DIFFERENT PERSONS I MEAN TO SAY IF
EVERY MAN'S FEELINGS WERE PECULIAR TO HIMSELF AND WERE NOT SHARED BY
THE REST OF HIS SPECIES I DO NOT SEE HOW WE COULD EVER COMMUNICATE OUR
IMPRESSIONS TO ONE ANOTHER
I MAKE THIS REMARK BECAUSE I PERCEIVE THAT
YOU AND I HAVE A COMMON FEELING
FOR WE ARE LOVERS BOTH AND BOTH OF
US HAVE TWO LOVES APIECE I AM THE LOVER OF ALCIBIADES THE SON OF
CLEINIAS AND OF PHILOSOPHY AND YOU OF THE ATHENIAN DEMUS AND OF
DEMUS THE SON OF PYRILAMPES
NOW I OBSERVE THAT YOU WITH ALL YOUR
CLEVERNESS DO NOT VENTURE TO CONTRADICT YOUR FAVOURITE IN ANY WORD OR
OPINION OF HIS BUT AS HE CHANGES YOU CHANGE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS
WHEN THE ATHENIAN DEMUS DENIES ANYTHING THAT YOU ARE SAYING IN THE
ASSEMBLY YOU GO OVER TO HIS OPINION AND YOU DO THE SAME WITH DEMUS
THE FAIR YOUNG SON OF PYRILAMPES
FOR YOU HAVE NOT THE POWER TO RESIST
THE WORDS AND IDEAS OF YOUR LOVES AND IF A PERSON WERE TO EXPRESS
SURPRISE AT THE STRANGENESS OF WHAT YOU SAY FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN UNDER
THEIR INFLUENCE YOU WOULD PROBABLY REPLY TO HIM IF YOU WERE HONEST
THAT YOU CANNOT HELP SAYING WHAT YOUR LOVES SAY UNLESS THEY ARE
PREVENTED AND THAT YOU CAN ONLY BE SILENT WHEN THEY ARE
NOW YOU MUST
UNDERSTAND THAT MY WORDS ARE AN ECHO TOO AND THEREFORE YOU NEED NOT
WONDER AT ME BUT IF YOU WANT TO SILENCE ME SILENCE PHILOSOPHY WHO
IS MY LOVE FOR SHE IS ALWAYS TELLING ME WHAT I AM NOW TELLING YOU MY
FRIEND NEITHER IS SHE CAPRICIOUS LIKE MY OTHER LOVE FOR THE SON
OF CLEINIAS SAYS ONE THING TO DAY AND ANOTHER THING TO MORROW BUT
PHILOSOPHY IS ALWAYS TRUE
SHE IS THE TEACHER AT WHOSE WORDS YOU ARE
NOW WONDERING AND YOU HAVE HEARD HER YOURSELF
HER YOU MUST REFUTE
AND EITHER SHOW AS I WAS SAYING THAT TO DO INJUSTICE AND TO ESCAPE
PUNISHMENT IS NOT THE WORST OF ALL EVILS OR IF YOU LEAVE HER WORD
UNREFUTED BY THE DOG THE GOD OF EGYPT I DECLARE O CALLICLES THAT
CALLICLES WILL NEVER BE AT ONE WITH HIMSELF BUT THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE
WILL BE A DISCORD
AND YET MY FRIEND I WOULD RATHER THAT MY LYRE
SHOULD BE INHARMONIOUS AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO MUSIC IN THE CHORUS
WHICH I PROVIDED AYE OR THAT THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD BE AT ODDS WITH
ME AND OPPOSE ME RATHER THAN THAT I MYSELF SHOULD BE AT ODDS WITH
MYSELF AND CONTRADICT MYSELF
CALLICLES O SOCRATES YOU ARE A REGULAR DECLAIMER AND SEEM TO BE
RUNNING RIOT IN THE ARGUMENT
AND NOW YOU ARE DECLAIMING IN THIS WAY
BECAUSE POLUS HAS FALLEN INTO THE SAME ERROR HIMSELF OF WHICH HE ACCUSED
GORGIAS FOR HE SAID THAT WHEN GORGIAS WAS ASKED BY YOU WHETHER IF
SOME ONE CAME TO HIM WHO WANTED TO LEARN RHETORIC AND DID NOT KNOW
JUSTICE HE WOULD TEACH HIM JUSTICE GORGIAS IN HIS MODESTY REPLIED THAT
HE WOULD BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT MANKIND IN GENERAL WOULD BE DISPLEASED
IF HE ANSWERED 'NO' AND THEN IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ADMISSION GORGIAS
WAS COMPELLED TO CONTRADICT HIMSELF THAT BEING JUST THE SORT OF THING
IN WHICH YOU DELIGHT
WHEREUPON POLUS LAUGHED AT YOU DESERVEDLY AS I
THINK BUT NOW HE HAS HIMSELF FALLEN INTO THE SAME TRAP
I CANNOT
SAY VERY MUCH FOR HIS WIT WHEN HE CONCEDED TO YOU THAT TO DO IS MORE
DISHONOURABLE THAN TO SUFFER INJUSTICE FOR THIS WAS THE ADMISSION WHICH
LED TO HIS BEING ENTANGLED BY YOU AND BECAUSE HE WAS TOO MODEST TO SAY
WHAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD HIS MOUTH STOPPED
FOR THE TRUTH IS SOCRATES
THAT YOU WHO PRETEND TO BE ENGAGED IN THE PURSUIT OF TRUTH ARE
APPEALING NOW TO THE POPULAR AND VULGAR NOTIONS OF RIGHT WHICH ARE NOT
NATURAL BUT ONLY CONVENTIONAL
CONVENTION AND NATURE ARE GENERALLY AT
VARIANCE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND HENCE IF A PERSON IS TOO MODEST TO SAY
WHAT HE THINKS HE IS COMPELLED TO CONTRADICT HIMSELF AND YOU IN YOUR
INGENUITY PERCEIVING THE ADVANTAGE TO BE THEREBY GAINED SLYLY ASK OF
HIM WHO IS ARGUING CONVENTIONALLY A QUESTION WHICH IS TO BE DETERMINED
BY THE RULE OF NATURE AND IF HE IS TALKING OF THE RULE OF NATURE YOU
SLIP AWAY TO CUSTOM AS FOR INSTANCE YOU DID IN THIS VERY DISCUSSION
ABOUT DOING AND SUFFERING INJUSTICE
WHEN POLUS WAS SPEAKING OF THE
CONVENTIONALLY DISHONOURABLE YOU ASSAILED HIM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW
OF NATURE FOR BY THE RULE OF NATURE TO SUFFER INJUSTICE IS THE GREATER
DISGRACE BECAUSE THE GREATER EVIL BUT CONVENTIONALLY TO DO EVIL IS THE
MORE DISGRACEFUL
FOR THE SUFFERING OF INJUSTICE IS NOT THE PART OF A
MAN BUT OF A SLAVE WHO INDEED HAD BETTER DIE THAN LIVE SINCE WHEN HE
IS WRONGED AND TRAMPLED UPON HE IS UNABLE TO HELP HIMSELF OR ANY OTHER
ABOUT WHOM HE CARES
THE REASON AS I CONCEIVE IS THAT THE MAKERS OF
LAWS ARE THE MAJORITY WHO ARE WEAK AND THEY MAKE LAWS AND DISTRIBUTE
PRAISES AND CENSURES WITH A VIEW TO THEMSELVES AND TO THEIR OWN
INTERESTS AND THEY TERRIFY THE STRONGER SORT OF MEN AND THOSE WHO
ARE ABLE TO GET THE BETTER OF THEM IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY NOT GET THE
BETTER OF THEM AND THEY SAY THAT DISHONESTY IS SHAMEFUL AND UNJUST
MEANING BY THE WORD INJUSTICE THE DESIRE OF A MAN TO HAVE MORE THAN
HIS NEIGHBOURS FOR KNOWING THEIR OWN INFERIORITY I SUSPECT THAT THEY
ARE TOO GLAD OF EQUALITY
AND THEREFORE THE ENDEAVOUR TO HAVE MORE
THAN THE MANY IS CONVENTIONALLY SAID TO BE SHAMEFUL AND UNJUST AND IS
CALLED INJUSTICE COMPARE REPUBLIC WHEREAS NATURE HERSELF INTIMATES
THAT IT IS JUST FOR THE BETTER TO HAVE MORE THAN THE WORSE THE MORE
POWERFUL THAN THE WEAKER AND IN MANY WAYS SHE SHOWS AMONG MEN AS WELL
AS AMONG ANIMALS AND INDEED AMONG WHOLE CITIES AND RACES THAT JUSTICE
CONSISTS IN THE SUPERIOR RULING OVER AND HAVING MORE THAN THE INFERIOR
FOR ON WHAT PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE DID XERXES INVADE HELLAS OR HIS FATHER
THE SCYTHIANS NOT TO SPEAK OF NUMBERLESS OTHER EXAMPLES
NAY BUT
THESE ARE THE MEN WHO ACT ACCORDING TO NATURE YES BY HEAVEN AND
ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF NATURE NOT PERHAPS ACCORDING TO THAT
ARTIFICIAL LAW WHICH WE INVENT AND IMPOSE UPON OUR FELLOWS OF WHOM WE
TAKE THE BEST AND STRONGEST FROM THEIR YOUTH UPWARDS AND TAME THEM LIKE
YOUNG LIONS CHARMING THEM WITH THE SOUND OF THE VOICE AND SAYING TO
THEM THAT WITH EQUALITY THEY MUST BE CONTENT AND THAT THE EQUAL IS
THE HONOURABLE AND THE JUST
BUT IF THERE WERE A MAN WHO HAD SUFFICIENT
FORCE HE WOULD SHAKE OFF AND BREAK THROUGH AND ESCAPE FROM ALL THIS
HE WOULD TRAMPLE UNDER FOOT ALL OUR FORMULAS AND SPELLS AND CHARMS AND
ALL OUR LAWS WHICH ARE AGAINST NATURE THE SLAVE WOULD RISE IN REBELLION
AND BE LORD OVER US AND THE LIGHT OF NATURAL JUSTICE WOULD SHINE FORTH
AND THIS I TAKE TO BE THE SENTIMENT OF PINDAR WHEN HE SAYS IN HIS POEM
THAT
'LAW IS THE KING OF ALL OF MORTALS AS WELL AS OF IMMORTALS
THIS AS HE SAYS
'MAKES MIGHT TO BE RIGHT DOING VIOLENCE WITH HIGHEST HAND AS I INFER
FROM THE DEEDS OF HERACLES FOR WITHOUT BUYING THEM FRAGM
INCERT
151 BOCKH I DO NOT REMEMBER THE EXACT WORDS BUT THE MEANING
IS THAT WITHOUT BUYING THEM AND WITHOUT THEIR BEING GIVEN TO HIM HE
CARRIED OFF THE OXEN OF GERYON ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF NATURAL RIGHT
AND THAT THE OXEN AND OTHER POSSESSIONS OF THE WEAKER AND INFERIOR
PROPERLY BELONG TO THE STRONGER AND SUPERIOR
AND THIS IS TRUE AS YOU
MAY ASCERTAIN IF YOU WILL LEAVE PHILOSOPHY AND GO ON TO HIGHER THINGS
FOR PHILOSOPHY SOCRATES IF PURSUED IN MODERATION AND AT THE PROPER
AGE IS AN ELEGANT ACCOMPLISHMENT BUT TOO MUCH PHILOSOPHY IS THE
RUIN OF HUMAN LIFE
EVEN IF A MAN HAS GOOD PARTS STILL IF HE CARRIES
PHILOSOPHY INTO LATER LIFE HE IS NECESSARILY IGNORANT OF ALL THOSE
THINGS WHICH A GENTLEMAN AND A PERSON OF HONOUR OUGHT TO KNOW HE IS
INEXPERIENCED IN THE LAWS OF THE STATE AND IN THE LANGUAGE WHICH OUGHT
TO BE USED IN THE DEALINGS OF MAN WITH MAN WHETHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC
AND UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THE PLEASURES AND DESIRES OF MANKIND AND OF
HUMAN CHARACTER IN GENERAL
AND PEOPLE OF THIS SORT WHEN THEY BETAKE
THEMSELVES TO POLITICS OR BUSINESS ARE AS RIDICULOUS AS I IMAGINE
THE POLITICIANS TO BE WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE IN THE ARENA OF
PHILOSOPHY
FOR AS EURIPIDES SAYS
'EVERY MAN SHINES IN THAT AND PURSUES THAT AND DEVOTES THE GREATEST
PORTION OF THE DAY TO THAT IN WHICH HE MOST EXCELS ANTIOPE FRAGM
20
DINDORF
BUT ANYTHING IN WHICH HE IS INFERIOR HE AVOIDS AND DEPRECIATES AND
PRAISES THE OPPOSITE FROM PARTIALITY TO HIMSELF AND BECAUSE HE THINKS
THAT HE WILL THUS PRAISE HIMSELF
THE TRUE PRINCIPLE IS TO UNITE THEM
PHILOSOPHY AS A PART OF EDUCATION IS AN EXCELLENT THING AND THERE
IS NO DISGRACE TO A MAN WHILE HE IS YOUNG IN PURSUING SUCH A STUDY BUT
WHEN HE IS MORE ADVANCED IN YEARS THE THING BECOMES RIDICULOUS AND
I FEEL TOWARDS PHILOSOPHERS AS I DO TOWARDS THOSE WHO LISP AND IMITATE
CHILDREN
FOR I LOVE TO SEE A LITTLE CHILD WHO IS NOT OF AN AGE TO
SPEAK PLAINLY LISPING AT HIS PLAY THERE IS AN APPEARANCE OF GRACE AND
FREEDOM IN HIS UTTERANCE WHICH IS NATURAL TO HIS CHILDISH YEARS
BUT
WHEN I HEAR SOME SMALL CREATURE CAREFULLY ARTICULATING ITS WORDS I AM
OFFENDED THE SOUND IS DISAGREEABLE AND HAS TO MY EARS THE TWANG OF
SLAVERY
SO WHEN I HEAR A MAN LISPING OR SEE HIM PLAYING LIKE A
CHILD HIS BEHAVIOUR APPEARS TO ME RIDICULOUS AND UNMANLY AND WORTHY OF
STRIPES
AND I HAVE THE SAME FEELING ABOUT STUDENTS OF PHILOSOPHY WHEN
I SEE A YOUTH THUS ENGAGED THE STUDY APPEARS TO ME TO BE IN CHARACTER
AND BECOMING A MAN OF LIBERAL EDUCATION AND HIM WHO NEGLECTS PHILOSOPHY
I REGARD AS AN INFERIOR MAN WHO WILL NEVER ASPIRE TO ANYTHING GREAT
OR NOBLE
BUT IF I SEE HIM CONTINUING THE STUDY IN LATER LIFE AND NOT
LEAVING OFF I SHOULD LIKE TO BEAT HIM SOCRATES FOR AS I WAS SAYING
SUCH A ONE EVEN THOUGH HE HAVE GOOD NATURAL PARTS BECOMES EFFEMINATE
HE FLIES FROM THE BUSY CENTRE AND THE MARKET PLACE IN WHICH AS THE
POET SAYS MEN BECOME DISTINGUISHED HE CREEPS INTO A CORNER FOR THE
REST OF HIS LIFE AND TALKS IN A WHISPER WITH THREE OR FOUR ADMIRING
YOUTHS BUT NEVER SPEAKS OUT LIKE A FREEMAN IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER
NOW I SOCRATES AM VERY WELL INCLINED TOWARDS YOU AND MY FEELING
MAY BE COMPARED WITH THAT OF ZETHUS TOWARDS AMPHION IN THE PLAY OF
EURIPIDES WHOM I WAS MENTIONING JUST NOW FOR I AM DISPOSED TO SAY
TO YOU MUCH WHAT ZETHUS SAID TO HIS BROTHER THAT YOU SOCRATES ARE
CARELESS ABOUT THE THINGS OF WHICH YOU OUGHT TO BE CAREFUL AND THAT YOU
'WHO HAVE A SOUL SO NOBLE ARE REMARKABLE FOR A PUERILE EXTERIOR
NEITHER IN A COURT OF JUSTICE COULD YOU STATE A CASE OR GIVE ANY REASON
OR PROOF OR OFFER VALIANT COUNSEL ON ANOTHER'S BEHALF
AND YOU MUST NOT BE OFFENDED MY DEAR SOCRATES FOR I AM SPEAKING OUT
OF GOOD WILL TOWARDS YOU IF I ASK WHETHER YOU ARE NOT ASHAMED OF BEING
THUS DEFENCELESS WHICH I AFFIRM TO BE THE CONDITION NOT OF YOU ONLY BUT
OF ALL THOSE WHO WILL CARRY THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY TOO FAR
FOR SUPPOSE
THAT SOME ONE WERE TO TAKE YOU OR ANY ONE OF YOUR SORT OFF TO PRISON
DECLARING THAT YOU HAD DONE WRONG WHEN YOU HAD DONE NO WRONG YOU MUST
ALLOW THAT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO THERE YOU WOULD STAND GIDDY
AND GAPING AND NOT HAVING A WORD TO SAY AND WHEN YOU WENT UP BEFORE
THE COURT EVEN IF THE ACCUSER WERE A POOR CREATURE AND NOT GOOD FOR
MUCH YOU WOULD DIE IF HE WERE DISPOSED TO CLAIM THE PENALTY OF DEATH
AND YET SOCRATES WHAT IS THE VALUE OF
'AN ART WHICH CONVERTS A MAN OF SENSE INTO A FOOL
WHO IS HELPLESS AND HAS NO POWER TO SAVE EITHER HIMSELF OR OTHERS WHEN
HE IS IN THE GREATEST DANGER AND IS GOING TO BE DESPOILED BY HIS ENEMIES
OF ALL HIS GOODS AND HAS TO LIVE SIMPLY DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHTS OF
CITIZENSHIP HE BEING A MAN WHO IF I MAY USE THE EXPRESSION MAY BE
BOXED ON THE EARS WITH IMPUNITY
THEN MY GOOD FRIEND TAKE MY ADVICE
AND REFUTE NO MORE
'LEARN THE PHILOSOPHY OF BUSINESS AND ACQUIRE THE REPUTATION OF WISDOM
BUT LEAVE TO OTHERS THESE NICETIES
WHETHER THEY ARE TO BE DESCRIBED AS FOLLIES OR ABSURDITIES
'FOR THEY WILL ONLY GIVE YOU POVERTY FOR THE INMATE OF YOUR DWELLING
CEASE THEN EMULATING THESE PALTRY SPLITTERS OF WORDS AND EMULATE ONLY
THE MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND HONOUR WHO IS WELL TO DO
SOCRATES IF MY SOUL CALLICLES WERE MADE OF GOLD SHOULD I NOT REJOICE
TO DISCOVER ONE OF THOSE STONES WITH WHICH THEY TEST GOLD AND THE VERY
BEST POSSIBLE ONE TO WHICH I MIGHT BRING MY SOUL AND IF THE STONE AND I
AGREED IN APPROVING OF HER TRAINING THEN I SHOULD KNOW THAT I WAS IN A
SATISFACTORY STATE AND THAT NO OTHER TEST WAS NEEDED BY ME
CALLICLES WHAT IS YOUR MEANING SOCRATES
SOCRATES I WILL TELL YOU I THINK THAT I HAVE FOUND IN YOU THE DESIRED
TOUCHSTONE
CALLICLES WHY
SOCRATES BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT IF YOU AGREE WITH ME IN ANY OF THE
OPINIONS WHICH MY SOUL FORMS I HAVE AT LAST FOUND THE TRUTH INDEED
FOR
I CONSIDER THAT IF A MAN IS TO MAKE A COMPLETE TRIAL OF THE GOOD OR EVIL
OF THE SOUL HE OUGHT TO HAVE THREE QUALITIES KNOWLEDGE GOOD WILL
OUTSPOKENNESS WHICH ARE ALL POSSESSED BY YOU
MANY WHOM I MEET ARE
UNABLE TO MAKE TRIAL OF ME BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT WISE AS YOU ARE OTHERS
ARE WISE BUT THEY WILL NOT TELL ME THE TRUTH BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT THE
SAME INTEREST IN ME WHICH YOU HAVE AND THESE TWO STRANGERS GORGIAS AND
POLUS ARE UNDOUBTEDLY WISE MEN AND MY VERY GOOD FRIENDS BUT THEY ARE
NOT OUTSPOKEN ENOUGH AND THEY ARE TOO MODEST
WHY THEIR MODESTY IS SO
GREAT THAT THEY ARE DRIVEN TO CONTRADICT THEMSELVES FIRST ONE AND THEN
THE OTHER OF THEM IN THE FACE OF A LARGE COMPANY ON MATTERS OF THE
HIGHEST MOMENT
BUT YOU HAVE ALL THE QUALITIES IN WHICH THESE OTHERS
ARE DEFICIENT HAVING RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION TO THIS MANY
ATHENIANS CAN TESTIFY
AND YOU ARE MY FRIEND
SHALL I TELL YOU WHY I
THINK SO I KNOW THAT YOU CALLICLES AND TISANDER OF APHIDNAE AND
ANDRON THE SON OF ANDROTION AND NAUSICYDES OF THE DEME OF CHOLARGES
STUDIED TOGETHER THERE WERE FOUR OF YOU AND I ONCE HEARD YOU ADVISING
WITH ONE ANOTHER AS TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PURSUIT OF PHILOSOPHY
SHOULD BE CARRIED AND AS I KNOW YOU CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE
STUDY SHOULD NOT BE PUSHED TOO MUCH INTO DETAIL
YOU WERE CAUTIONING ONE
ANOTHER NOT TO BE OVERWISE YOU WERE AFRAID THAT TOO MUCH WISDOM MIGHT
UNCONSCIOUSLY TO YOURSELVES BE THE RUIN OF YOU
AND NOW WHEN I HEAR YOU
GIVING THE SAME ADVICE TO ME WHICH YOU THEN GAVE TO YOUR MOST INTIMATE
FRIENDS I HAVE A SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF YOUR REAL GOOD WILL TO ME
AND
OF THE FRANKNESS OF YOUR NATURE AND FREEDOM FROM MODESTY I AM ASSURED BY
YOURSELF AND THE ASSURANCE IS CONFIRMED BY YOUR LAST SPEECH
WELL THEN
THE INFERENCE IN THE PRESENT CASE CLEARLY IS THAT IF YOU AGREE WITH ME
IN AN ARGUMENT ABOUT ANY POINT THAT POINT WILL HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY
TESTED BY US AND WILL NOT REQUIRE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ANY FURTHER TEST
FOR YOU COULD NOT HAVE AGREED WITH ME EITHER FROM LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR
FROM SUPERFLUITY OF MODESTY NOR YET FROM A DESIRE TO DECEIVE ME FOR
YOU ARE MY FRIEND AS YOU TELL ME YOURSELF
AND THEREFORE WHEN YOU AND
I ARE AGREED THE RESULT WILL BE THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFECT TRUTH
NOW
THERE IS NO NOBLER ENQUIRY CALLICLES THAN THAT WHICH YOU CENSURE
ME FOR MAKING WHAT OUGHT THE CHARACTER OF A MAN TO BE AND WHAT HIS
PURSUITS AND HOW FAR IS HE TO GO BOTH IN MATURER YEARS AND IN
YOUTH FOR BE ASSURED THAT IF I ERR IN MY OWN CONDUCT I DO NOT ERR
INTENTIONALLY BUT FROM IGNORANCE
DO NOT THEN DESIST FROM ADVISING ME
NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEGUN UNTIL I HAVE LEARNED CLEARLY WHAT THIS IS WHICH
I AM TO PRACTISE AND HOW I MAY ACQUIRE IT
AND IF YOU FIND ME ASSENTING
TO YOUR WORDS AND HEREAFTER NOT DOING THAT TO WHICH I ASSENTED CALL
ME 'DOLT AND DEEM ME UNWORTHY OF RECEIVING FURTHER INSTRUCTION
ONCE
MORE THEN TELL ME WHAT YOU AND PINDAR MEAN BY NATURAL JUSTICE DO YOU
NOT MEAN THAT THE SUPERIOR SHOULD TAKE THE PROPERTY OF THE INFERIOR BY
FORCE THAT THE BETTER SHOULD RULE THE WORSE THE NOBLE HAVE MORE THAN
THE MEAN AM I NOT RIGHT IN MY RECOLLECTION
CALLICLES YES THAT IS WHAT I WAS SAYING AND SO I STILL AVER
SOCRATES AND DO YOU MEAN BY THE BETTER THE SAME AS THE SUPERIOR FOR I
COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING AT THE TIME WHETHER YOU
MEANT BY THE SUPERIOR THE STRONGER AND THAT THE WEAKER MUST OBEY THE
STRONGER AS YOU SEEMED TO IMPLY WHEN YOU SAID THAT GREAT CITIES ATTACK
SMALL ONES IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATURAL RIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPERIOR
AND STRONGER AS THOUGH THE SUPERIOR AND STRONGER AND BETTER WERE THE
SAME OR WHETHER THE BETTER MAY BE ALSO THE INFERIOR AND WEAKER AND THE
SUPERIOR THE WORSE OR WHETHER BETTER IS TO BE DEFINED IN THE SAME WAY
AS SUPERIOR THIS IS THE POINT WHICH I WANT TO HAVE CLEARED UP
ARE THE
SUPERIOR AND BETTER AND STRONGER THE SAME OR DIFFERENT
CALLICLES I SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THEY ARE THE SAME
SOCRATES THEN THE MANY ARE BY NATURE SUPERIOR TO THE ONE AGAINST WHOM
AS YOU WERE SAYING THEY MAKE THE LAWS
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THEN THE LAWS OF THE MANY ARE THE LAWS OF THE SUPERIOR
CALLICLES VERY TRUE
SOCRATES THEN THEY ARE THE LAWS OF THE BETTER FOR THE SUPERIOR CLASS
ARE FAR BETTER AS YOU WERE SAYING
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND SINCE THEY ARE SUPERIOR THE LAWS WHICH ARE MADE BY THEM
ARE BY NATURE GOOD
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND ARE NOT THE MANY OF OPINION AS YOU WERE LATELY SAYING
THAT JUSTICE IS EQUALITY AND THAT TO DO IS MORE DISGRACEFUL THAN TO
SUFFER INJUSTICE IS THAT SO OR NOT ANSWER CALLICLES AND LET NO
MODESTY BE FOUND TO COME IN THE WAY DO THE MANY THINK OR DO THEY NOT
THINK THUS I MUST BEG OF YOU TO ANSWER IN ORDER THAT IF YOU AGREE
WITH ME I MAY FORTIFY MYSELF BY THE ASSENT OF SO COMPETENT AN AUTHORITY
CALLICLES YES THE OPINION OF THE MANY IS WHAT YOU SAY
SOCRATES THEN NOT ONLY CUSTOM BUT NATURE ALSO AFFIRMS THAT TO DO IS
MORE DISGRACEFUL THAN TO SUFFER INJUSTICE AND THAT JUSTICE IS EQUALITY
SO THAT YOU SEEM TO HAVE BEEN WRONG IN YOUR FORMER ASSERTION WHEN
ACCUSING ME YOU SAID THAT NATURE AND CUSTOM ARE OPPOSED AND THAT I
KNOWING THIS WAS DISHONESTLY PLAYING BETWEEN THEM APPEALING TO CUSTOM
WHEN THE ARGUMENT IS ABOUT NATURE AND TO NATURE WHEN THE ARGUMENT IS
ABOUT CUSTOM
CALLICLES THIS MAN WILL NEVER CEASE TALKING NONSENSE
AT YOUR AGE
SOCRATES ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO BE CATCHING AT WORDS AND CHUCKLING OVER
SOME VERBAL SLIP DO YOU NOT SEE HAVE I NOT TOLD YOU ALREADY THAT BY
SUPERIOR I MEAN BETTER DO YOU IMAGINE ME TO SAY THAT IF A RABBLE OF
SLAVES AND NONDESCRIPTS WHO ARE OF NO USE EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THEIR
PHYSICAL STRENGTH GET TOGETHER THEIR IPSISSIMA VERBA ARE LAWS
SOCRATES HO MY PHILOSOPHER IS THAT YOUR LINE
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES I WAS THINKING CALLICLES THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND MUST
HAVE BEEN IN YOUR MIND AND THAT IS WHY I REPEATED THE QUESTION WHAT
IS THE SUPERIOR I WANTED TO KNOW CLEARLY WHAT YOU MEANT FOR YOU SURELY
DO NOT THINK THAT TWO MEN ARE BETTER THAN ONE OR THAT YOUR SLAVES ARE
BETTER THAN YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONGER THEN PLEASE TO BEGIN AGAIN
AND TELL ME WHO THE BETTER ARE IF THEY ARE NOT THE STRONGER AND I WILL
ASK YOU GREAT SIR TO BE A LITTLE MILDER IN YOUR INSTRUCTIONS OR I
SHALL HAVE TO RUN AWAY FROM YOU
CALLICLES YOU ARE IRONICAL
SOCRATES NO BY THE HERO ZETHUS CALLICLES BY WHOSE AID YOU WERE JUST
NOW SAYING MANY IRONICAL THINGS AGAINST ME I AM NOT TELL ME THEN
WHOM YOU MEAN BY THE BETTER
CALLICLES I MEAN THE MORE EXCELLENT
SOCRATES DO YOU NOT SEE THAT YOU ARE YOURSELF USING WORDS WHICH HAVE NO
MEANING AND THAT YOU ARE EXPLAINING NOTHING WILL YOU TELL ME WHETHER
YOU MEAN BY THE BETTER AND SUPERIOR THE WISER OR IF NOT WHOM
CALLICLES MOST ASSUREDLY I DO MEAN THE WISER
SOCRATES THEN ACCORDING TO YOU ONE WISE MAN MAY OFTEN BE SUPERIOR TO
TEN THOUSAND FOOLS AND HE OUGHT TO RULE THEM AND THEY OUGHT TO BE HIS
SUBJECTS AND HE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE THAN THEY SHOULD
THIS IS WHAT
I BELIEVE THAT YOU MEAN AND YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT I AM
WORD CATCHING IF YOU ALLOW THAT THE ONE IS SUPERIOR TO THE TEN
THOUSAND
CALLICLES YES THAT IS WHAT I MEAN AND THAT IS WHAT I CONCEIVE TO BE
NATURAL JUSTICE THAT THE BETTER AND WISER SHOULD RULE AND HAVE MORE
THAN THE INFERIOR
SOCRATES STOP THERE AND LET ME ASK YOU WHAT YOU WOULD SAY IN THIS
CASE LET US SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE ALL TOGETHER AS WE ARE NOW THERE ARE
SEVERAL OF US AND WE HAVE A LARGE COMMON STORE OF MEATS AND DRINKS AND
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF PERSONS IN OUR COMPANY HAVING VARIOUS DEGREES OF
STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS AND ONE OF US BEING A PHYSICIAN IS WISER IN THE
MATTER OF FOOD THAN ALL THE REST AND HE IS PROBABLY STRONGER THAN SOME
AND NOT SO STRONG AS OTHERS OF US WILL HE NOT BEING WISER BE ALSO
BETTER THAN WE ARE AND OUR SUPERIOR IN THIS MATTER OF FOOD
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES EITHER THEN HE WILL HAVE A LARGER SHARE OF THE MEATS AND
DRINKS BECAUSE HE IS BETTER OR HE WILL HAVE THE DISTRIBUTION OF ALL OF
THEM BY REASON OF HIS AUTHORITY BUT HE WILL NOT EXPEND OR MAKE USE OF
A LARGER SHARE OF THEM ON HIS OWN PERSON OR IF HE DOES HE WILL BE
PUNISHED HIS SHARE WILL EXCEED THAT OF SOME AND BE LESS THAN THAT OF
OTHERS AND IF HE BE THE WEAKEST OF ALL HE BEING THE BEST OF ALL WILL
HAVE THE SMALLEST SHARE OF ALL CALLICLES AM I NOT RIGHT MY FRIEND
CALLICLES YOU TALK ABOUT MEATS AND DRINKS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER
NONSENSE I AM NOT SPEAKING OF THEM
SOCRATES WELL BUT DO YOU ADMIT THAT THE WISER IS THE BETTER ANSWER
'YES' OR 'NO
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND OUGHT NOT THE BETTER TO HAVE A LARGER SHARE
CALLICLES NOT OF MEATS AND DRINKS
SOCRATES I UNDERSTAND THEN PERHAPS OF COATS THE SKILFULLEST WEAVER
OUGHT TO HAVE THE LARGEST COAT AND THE GREATEST NUMBER OF THEM AND GO
ABOUT CLOTHED IN THE BEST AND FINEST OF THEM
CALLICLES FUDGE ABOUT COATS
SOCRATES THEN THE SKILFULLEST AND BEST IN MAKING SHOES OUGHT TO HAVE
THE ADVANTAGE IN SHOES THE SHOEMAKER CLEARLY SHOULD WALK ABOUT IN THE
LARGEST SHOES AND HAVE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF THEM
CALLICLES FUDGE ABOUT SHOES WHAT NONSENSE ARE YOU TALKING
SOCRATES OR IF THIS IS NOT YOUR MEANING PERHAPS YOU WOULD SAY THAT
THE WISE AND GOOD AND TRUE HUSBANDMAN SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A LARGER
SHARE OF SEEDS AND HAVE AS MUCH SEED AS POSSIBLE FOR HIS OWN LAND
CALLICLES HOW YOU GO ON ALWAYS TALKING IN THE SAME WAY SOCRATES
SOCRATES YES CALLICLES AND ALSO ABOUT THE SAME THINGS
CALLICLES YES BY THE GODS YOU ARE LITERALLY ALWAYS TALKING OF
COBBLERS AND FULLERS AND COOKS AND DOCTORS AS IF THIS HAD TO DO WITH
OUR ARGUMENT
SOCRATES BUT WHY WILL YOU NOT TELL ME IN WHAT A MAN MUST BE SUPERIOR
AND WISER IN ORDER TO CLAIM A LARGER SHARE WILL YOU NEITHER ACCEPT A
SUGGESTION NOR OFFER ONE
CALLICLES I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE I MEAN BY
SUPERIORS NOT COBBLERS OR COOKS BUT WISE POLITICIANS WHO UNDERSTAND THE
ADMINISTRATION OF A STATE AND WHO ARE NOT ONLY WISE BUT ALSO VALIANT
AND ABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR DESIGNS AND NOT THE MEN TO FAINT FROM WANT
OF SOUL
SOCRATES SEE NOW MOST EXCELLENT CALLICLES HOW DIFFERENT MY CHARGE
AGAINST YOU IS FROM THAT WHICH YOU BRING AGAINST ME FOR YOU REPROACH
ME WITH ALWAYS SAYING THE SAME BUT I REPROACH YOU WITH NEVER SAYING THE
SAME ABOUT THE SAME THINGS FOR AT ONE TIME YOU WERE DEFINING THE BETTER
AND THE SUPERIOR TO BE THE STRONGER THEN AGAIN AS THE WISER AND NOW
YOU BRING FORWARD A NEW NOTION THE SUPERIOR AND THE BETTER ARE NOW
DECLARED BY YOU TO BE THE MORE COURAGEOUS I WISH MY GOOD FRIEND THAT
YOU WOULD TELL ME ONCE FOR ALL WHOM YOU AFFIRM TO BE THE BETTER AND
SUPERIOR AND IN WHAT THEY ARE BETTER
CALLICLES I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I MEAN THOSE WHO ARE WISE AND
COURAGEOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF A STATE THEY OUGHT TO BE THE RULERS
OF THEIR STATES AND JUSTICE CONSISTS IN THEIR HAVING MORE THAN THEIR
SUBJECTS
SOCRATES BUT WHETHER RULERS OR SUBJECTS WILL THEY OR WILL THEY NOT HAVE
MORE THAN THEMSELVES MY FRIEND
CALLICLES WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SOCRATES I MEAN THAT EVERY MAN IS HIS OWN RULER BUT PERHAPS YOU THINK
THAT THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR HIM TO RULE HIMSELF HE IS ONLY REQUIRED
TO RULE OTHERS
CALLICLES WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY HIS 'RULING OVER HIMSELF'
SOCRATES A SIMPLE THING ENOUGH JUST WHAT IS COMMONLY SAID THAT A
MAN SHOULD BE TEMPERATE AND MASTER OF HIMSELF AND RULER OF HIS OWN
PLEASURES AND PASSIONS
CALLICLES WHAT INNOCENCE YOU MEAN THOSE FOOLS THE TEMPERATE
SOCRATES CERTAINLY ANY ONE MAY KNOW THAT TO BE MY MEANING
CALLICLES QUITE SO SOCRATES AND THEY ARE REALLY FOOLS FOR HOW CAN A
MAN BE HAPPY WHO IS THE SERVANT OF ANYTHING ON THE CONTRARY I PLAINLY
ASSERT THAT HE WHO WOULD TRULY LIVE OUGHT TO ALLOW HIS DESIRES TO WAX
TO THE UTTERMOST AND NOT TO CHASTISE THEM BUT WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN TO
THEIR GREATEST HE SHOULD HAVE COURAGE AND INTELLIGENCE TO MINISTER TO
THEM AND TO SATISFY ALL HIS LONGINGS
AND THIS I AFFIRM TO BE NATURAL
JUSTICE AND NOBILITY
TO THIS HOWEVER THE MANY CANNOT ATTAIN AND THEY
BLAME THE STRONG MAN BECAUSE THEY ARE ASHAMED OF THEIR OWN WEAKNESS
WHICH THEY DESIRE TO CONCEAL AND HENCE THEY SAY THAT INTEMPERANCE IS
BASE
AS I HAVE REMARKED ALREADY THEY ENSLAVE THE NOBLER NATURES AND
BEING UNABLE TO SATISFY THEIR PLEASURES THEY PRAISE TEMPERANCE AND
JUSTICE OUT OF THEIR OWN COWARDICE
FOR IF A MAN HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY
THE SON OF A KING OR HAD A NATURE CAPABLE OF ACQUIRING AN EMPIRE OR
A TYRANNY OR SOVEREIGNTY WHAT COULD BE MORE TRULY BASE OR EVIL THAN
TEMPERANCE TO A MAN LIKE HIM I SAY WHO MIGHT FREELY BE ENJOYING EVERY
GOOD AND HAS NO ONE TO STAND IN HIS WAY AND YET HAS ADMITTED CUSTOM
AND REASON AND THE OPINION OF OTHER MEN TO BE LORDS OVER HIM MUST
NOT HE BE IN A MISERABLE PLIGHT WHOM THE REPUTATION OF JUSTICE AND
TEMPERANCE HINDERS FROM GIVING MORE TO HIS FRIENDS THAN TO HIS ENEMIES
EVEN THOUGH HE BE A RULER IN HIS CITY NAY SOCRATES FOR YOU PROFESS
TO BE A VOTARY OF THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH IS THIS THAT LUXURY AND
INTEMPERANCE AND LICENCE IF THEY BE PROVIDED WITH MEANS ARE VIRTUE AND
HAPPINESS ALL THE REST IS A MERE BAUBLE AGREEMENTS CONTRARY TO NATURE
FOOLISH TALK OF MEN NOTHING WORTH
COMPARE REPUBLIC
SOCRATES THERE IS A NOBLE FREEDOM CALLICLES IN YOUR WAY OF
APPROACHING THE ARGUMENT FOR WHAT YOU SAY IS WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD
THINK BUT DO NOT LIKE TO SAY
AND I MUST BEG OF YOU TO PERSEVERE THAT
THE TRUE RULE OF HUMAN LIFE MAY BECOME MANIFEST
TELL ME THEN YOU
SAY DO YOU NOT THAT IN THE RIGHTLY DEVELOPED MAN THE PASSIONS OUGHT
NOT TO BE CONTROLLED BUT THAT WE SHOULD LET THEM GROW TO THE UTMOST AND
SOMEHOW OR OTHER SATISFY THEM AND THAT THIS IS VIRTUE
CALLICLES YES I DO
SOCRATES THEN THOSE WHO WANT NOTHING ARE NOT TRULY SAID TO BE HAPPY
CALLICLES NO INDEED FOR THEN STONES AND DEAD MEN WOULD BE THE HAPPIEST
OF ALL
SOCRATES BUT SURELY LIFE ACCORDING TO YOUR VIEW IS AN AWFUL THING AND
INDEED I THINK THAT EURIPIDES MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN SAYING
'WHO KNOWS IF LIFE BE NOT DEATH AND DEATH LIFE
AND THAT WE ARE VERY LIKELY DEAD I HAVE HEARD A PHILOSOPHER SAY THAT AT
THIS MOMENT WE ARE ACTUALLY DEAD AND THAT THE BODY SOMA IS OUR TOMB
SEMA COMPARE PHAEDR AND THAT THE PART OF THE SOUL WHICH IS THE
SEAT OF THE DESIRES IS LIABLE TO BE TOSSED ABOUT BY WORDS AND BLOWN UP
AND DOWN AND SOME INGENIOUS PERSON PROBABLY A SICILIAN OR AN
ITALIAN PLAYING WITH THE WORD INVENTED A TALE IN WHICH HE CALLED THE
SOUL BECAUSE OF ITS BELIEVING AND MAKE BELIEVE NATURE A VESSEL AN
UNTRANSLATABLE PUN DIA TO PITHANON TE KAI PISTIKON ONOMASE PITHON
AND THE IGNORANT HE CALLED THE UNINITIATED OR LEAKY AND THE PLACE IN
THE SOULS OF THE UNINITIATED IN WHICH THE DESIRES ARE SEATED BEING THE
INTEMPERATE AND INCONTINENT PART HE COMPARED TO A VESSEL FULL OF HOLES
BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED
HE IS NOT OF YOUR WAY OF THINKING
CALLICLES FOR HE DECLARES THAT OF ALL THE SOULS IN HADES MEANING THE
INVISIBLE WORLD AEIDES THESE UNINITIATED OR LEAKY PERSONS ARE THE
MOST MISERABLE AND THAT THEY POUR WATER INTO A VESSEL WHICH IS FULL OF
HOLES OUT OF A COLANDER WHICH IS SIMILARLY PERFORATED
THE COLANDER AS
MY INFORMER ASSURES ME IS THE SOUL AND THE SOUL WHICH HE COMPARES TO
A COLANDER IS THE SOUL OF THE IGNORANT WHICH IS LIKEWISE FULL OF HOLES
AND THEREFORE INCONTINENT OWING TO A BAD MEMORY AND WANT OF FAITH
THESE NOTIONS ARE STRANGE ENOUGH BUT THEY SHOW THE PRINCIPLE WHICH IF
I CAN I WOULD FAIN PROVE TO YOU THAT YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND
AND INSTEAD OF THE INTEMPERATE AND INSATIATE LIFE CHOOSE THAT WHICH
IS ORDERLY AND SUFFICIENT AND HAS A DUE PROVISION FOR DAILY NEEDS
DO I
MAKE ANY IMPRESSION ON YOU AND ARE YOU COMING OVER TO THE OPINION THAT
THE ORDERLY ARE HAPPIER THAN THE INTEMPERATE OR DO I FAIL TO PERSUADE
YOU AND HOWEVER MANY TALES I REHEARSE TO YOU DO YOU CONTINUE OF THE
SAME OPINION STILL
CALLICLES THE LATTER SOCRATES IS MORE LIKE THE TRUTH
SOCRATES WELL I WILL TELL YOU ANOTHER IMAGE WHICH COMES OUT OF THE
SAME SCHOOL LET ME REQUEST YOU TO CONSIDER HOW FAR YOU WOULD ACCEPT
THIS AS AN ACCOUNT OF THE TWO LIVES OF THE TEMPERATE AND INTEMPERATE IN
A FIGURE THERE ARE TWO MEN BOTH OF WHOM HAVE A NUMBER OF CASKS THE
ONE MAN HAS HIS CASKS SOUND AND FULL ONE OF WINE ANOTHER OF HONEY
AND A THIRD OF MILK BESIDES OTHERS FILLED WITH OTHER LIQUIDS AND THE
STREAMS WHICH FILL THEM ARE FEW AND SCANTY AND HE CAN ONLY OBTAIN THEM
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF TOIL AND DIFFICULTY BUT WHEN HIS CASKS ARE ONCE
FILLED HE HAS NO NEED TO FEED THEM ANY MORE AND HAS NO FURTHER TROUBLE
WITH THEM OR CARE ABOUT THEM
THE OTHER IN LIKE MANNER CAN PROCURE
STREAMS THOUGH NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT HIS VESSELS ARE LEAKY AND
UNSOUND AND NIGHT AND DAY HE IS COMPELLED TO BE FILLING THEM AND IF
HE PAUSES FOR A MOMENT HE IS IN AN AGONY OF PAIN
SUCH ARE THEIR
RESPECTIVE LIVES AND NOW WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE LIFE OF THE
INTEMPERATE IS HAPPIER THAN THAT OF THE TEMPERATE DO I NOT CONVINCE YOU
THAT THE OPPOSITE IS THE TRUTH
CALLICLES YOU DO NOT CONVINCE ME SOCRATES FOR THE ONE WHO HAS FILLED
HIMSELF HAS NO LONGER ANY PLEASURE LEFT AND THIS AS I WAS JUST NOW
SAYING IS THE LIFE OF A STONE HE HAS NEITHER JOY NOR SORROW AFTER HE
IS ONCE FILLED BUT THE PLEASURE DEPENDS ON THE SUPERABUNDANCE OF THE
INFLUX
SOCRATES BUT THE MORE YOU POUR IN THE GREATER THE WASTE AND THE HOLES
MUST BE LARGE FOR THE LIQUID TO ESCAPE
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THE LIFE WHICH YOU ARE NOW DEPICTING IS NOT THAT OF A DEAD
MAN OR OF A STONE BUT OF A CORMORANT YOU MEAN THAT HE IS TO BE
HUNGERING AND EATING
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND HE IS TO BE THIRSTING AND DRINKING
CALLICLES YES THAT IS WHAT I MEAN HE IS TO HAVE ALL HIS DESIRES ABOUT
HIM AND TO BE ABLE TO LIVE HAPPILY IN THE GRATIFICATION OF THEM
SOCRATES CAPITAL EXCELLENT GO ON AS YOU HAVE BEGUN AND HAVE NO
SHAME I TOO MUST DISENCUMBER MYSELF OF SHAME AND FIRST WILL YOU
TELL ME WHETHER YOU INCLUDE ITCHING AND SCRATCHING PROVIDED YOU HAVE
ENOUGH OF THEM AND PASS YOUR LIFE IN SCRATCHING IN YOUR NOTION OF
HAPPINESS
CALLICLES WHAT A STRANGE BEING YOU ARE SOCRATES A REGULAR MOB ORATOR
SOCRATES THAT WAS THE REASON CALLICLES WHY I SCARED POLUS AND
GORGIAS UNTIL THEY WERE TOO MODEST TO SAY WHAT THEY THOUGHT BUT YOU
WILL NOT BE TOO MODEST AND WILL NOT BE SCARED FOR YOU ARE A BRAVE MAN
AND NOW ANSWER MY QUESTION
CALLICLES I ANSWER THAT EVEN THE SCRATCHER WOULD LIVE PLEASANTLY
SOCRATES AND IF PLEASANTLY THEN ALSO HAPPILY
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES BUT WHAT IF THE ITCHING IS NOT CONFINED TO THE HEAD SHALL I
PURSUE THE QUESTION AND HERE CALLICLES I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER HOW
YOU WOULD REPLY IF CONSEQUENCES ARE PRESSED UPON YOU ESPECIALLY IF IN
THE LAST RESORT YOU ARE ASKED WHETHER THE LIFE OF A CATAMITE IS NOT
TERRIBLE FOUL MISERABLE OR WOULD YOU VENTURE TO SAY THAT THEY TOO
ARE HAPPY IF THEY ONLY GET ENOUGH OF WHAT THEY WANT
CALLICLES ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED SOCRATES OF INTRODUCING SUCH TOPICS
INTO THE ARGUMENT
SOCRATES WELL MY FINE FRIEND BUT AM I THE INTRODUCER OF THESE TOPICS
OR HE WHO SAYS WITHOUT ANY QUALIFICATION THAT ALL WHO FEEL PLEASURE IN
WHATEVER MANNER ARE HAPPY AND WHO ADMITS OF NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN GOOD
AND BAD PLEASURES AND I WOULD STILL ASK WHETHER YOU SAY THAT PLEASURE
AND GOOD ARE THE SAME OR WHETHER THERE IS SOME PLEASURE WHICH IS NOT A
GOOD
CALLICLES WELL THEN FOR THE SAKE OF CONSISTENCY I WILL SAY THAT THEY
ARE THE SAME
SOCRATES YOU ARE BREAKING THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT CALLICLES AND WILL
NO LONGER BE A SATISFACTORY COMPANION IN THE SEARCH AFTER TRUTH IF YOU
SAY WHAT IS CONTRARY TO YOUR REAL OPINION
CALLICLES WHY THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING TOO SOCRATES
SOCRATES THEN WE ARE BOTH DOING WRONG
STILL MY DEAR FRIEND I WOULD
ASK YOU TO CONSIDER WHETHER PLEASURE FROM WHATEVER SOURCE DERIVED IS
THE GOOD FOR IF THIS BE TRUE THEN THE DISAGREEABLE CONSEQUENCES WHICH
HAVE BEEN DARKLY INTIMATED MUST FOLLOW AND MANY OTHERS
CALLICLES THAT SOCRATES IS ONLY YOUR OPINION
SOCRATES AND DO YOU CALLICLES SERIOUSLY MAINTAIN WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
CALLICLES INDEED I DO
SOCRATES THEN AS YOU ARE IN EARNEST SHALL WE PROCEED WITH THE
ARGUMENT
CALLICLES BY ALL MEANS
OR 'I AM IN PROFOUND EARNEST
SOCRATES WELL IF YOU ARE WILLING TO PROCEED DETERMINE THIS QUESTION
FOR ME THERE IS SOMETHING I PRESUME WHICH YOU WOULD CALL KNOWLEDGE
CALLICLES THERE IS
SOCRATES AND WERE YOU NOT SAYING JUST NOW THAT SOME COURAGE IMPLIED
KNOWLEDGE
CALLICLES I WAS
SOCRATES AND YOU WERE SPEAKING OF COURAGE AND KNOWLEDGE AS TWO THINGS
DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER
CALLICLES CERTAINLY I WAS
SOCRATES AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT PLEASURE AND KNOWLEDGE ARE THE SAME OR
NOT THE SAME
CALLICLES NOT THE SAME O MAN OF WISDOM
SOCRATES AND WOULD YOU SAY THAT COURAGE DIFFERED FROM PLEASURE
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES WELL THEN LET US REMEMBER THAT CALLICLES THE ACHARNIAN
SAYS THAT PLEASURE AND GOOD ARE THE SAME BUT THAT KNOWLEDGE AND COURAGE
ARE NOT THE SAME EITHER WITH ONE ANOTHER OR WITH THE GOOD
CALLICLES AND WHAT DOES OUR FRIEND SOCRATES OF FOXTON SAY DOES HE
ASSENT TO THIS OR NOT
SOCRATES HE DOES NOT ASSENT NEITHER WILL CALLICLES WHEN HE SEES
HIMSELF TRULY
YOU WILL ADMIT I SUPPOSE THAT GOOD AND EVIL FORTUNE ARE
OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND IF THEY ARE OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER THEN LIKE HEALTH AND
DISEASE THEY EXCLUDE ONE ANOTHER A MAN CANNOT HAVE THEM BOTH OR BE
WITHOUT THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME
CALLICLES WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SOCRATES TAKE THE CASE OF ANY BODILY AFFECTION A MAN MAY HAVE THE
COMPLAINT IN HIS EYES WHICH IS CALLED OPHTHALMIA
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES BUT HE SURELY CANNOT HAVE THE SAME EYES WELL AND SOUND AT THE
SAME TIME
CALLICLES CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES AND WHEN HE HAS GOT RID OF HIS OPHTHALMIA HAS HE GOT RID OF
THE HEALTH OF HIS EYES TOO IS THE FINAL RESULT THAT HE GETS RID OF
THEM BOTH TOGETHER
CALLICLES CERTAINLY NOT
SOCRATES THAT WOULD SURELY BE MARVELLOUS AND ABSURD
CALLICLES VERY
SOCRATES I SUPPOSE THAT HE IS AFFECTED BY THEM AND GETS RID OF THEM IN
TURNS
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND HE MAY HAVE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IN THE SAME WAY BY
FITS
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES OR SWIFTNESS AND SLOWNESS
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND DOES HE HAVE AND NOT HAVE GOOD AND HAPPINESS AND
THEIR OPPOSITES EVIL AND MISERY IN A SIMILAR ALTERNATION COMPARE
REPUBLIC
CALLICLES CERTAINLY HE HAS
SOCRATES IF THEN THERE BE ANYTHING WHICH A MAN HAS AND HAS NOT AT THE
SAME TIME CLEARLY THAT CANNOT BE GOOD AND EVIL DO WE AGREE PLEASE NOT
TO ANSWER WITHOUT CONSIDERATION
CALLICLES I ENTIRELY AGREE
SOCRATES GO BACK NOW TO OUR FORMER ADMISSIONS DID YOU SAY THAT TO
HUNGER I MEAN THE MERE STATE OF HUNGER WAS PLEASANT OR PAINFUL
CALLICLES I SAID PAINFUL BUT THAT TO EAT WHEN YOU ARE HUNGRY IS
PLEASANT
SOCRATES I KNOW BUT STILL THE ACTUAL HUNGER IS PAINFUL AM I NOT
RIGHT
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND THIRST TOO IS PAINFUL
CALLICLES YES VERY
SOCRATES NEED I ADDUCE ANY MORE INSTANCES OR WOULD YOU AGREE THAT ALL
WANTS OR DESIRES ARE PAINFUL
CALLICLES I AGREE AND THEREFORE YOU NEED NOT ADDUCE ANY MORE
INSTANCES
SOCRATES VERY GOOD
AND YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT TO DRINK WHEN YOU ARE
THIRSTY IS PLEASANT
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND IN THE SENTENCE WHICH YOU HAVE JUST UTTERED THE WORD
'THIRSTY' IMPLIES PAIN
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND THE WORD 'DRINKING' IS EXPRESSIVE OF PLEASURE AND OF THE
SATISFACTION OF THE WANT
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THERE IS PLEASURE IN DRINKING
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES WHEN YOU ARE THIRSTY
SOCRATES AND IN PAIN
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES DO YOU SEE THE INFERENCE THAT PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE
SIMULTANEOUS WHEN YOU SAY THAT BEING THIRSTY YOU DRINK FOR ARE THEY
NOT SIMULTANEOUS AND DO THEY NOT AFFECT AT THE SAME TIME THE SAME PART
WHETHER OF THE SOUL OR THE BODY WHICH OF THEM IS AFFECTED CANNOT BE
SUPPOSED TO BE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE IS NOT THIS TRUE
CALLICLES IT IS
SOCRATES YOU SAID ALSO THAT NO MAN COULD HAVE GOOD AND EVIL FORTUNE AT
THE SAME TIME
CALLICLES YES I DID
SOCRATES BUT YOU ADMITTED THAT WHEN IN PAIN A MAN MIGHT ALSO HAVE
PLEASURE
CALLICLES CLEARLY
SOCRATES THEN PLEASURE IS NOT THE SAME AS GOOD FORTUNE OR PAIN THE
SAME AS EVIL FORTUNE AND THEREFORE THE GOOD IS NOT THE SAME AS THE
PLEASANT
CALLICLES I WISH I KNEW SOCRATES WHAT YOUR QUIBBLING MEANS
SOCRATES YOU KNOW CALLICLES BUT YOU AFFECT NOT TO KNOW
CALLICLES WELL GET ON AND DON'T KEEP FOOLING THEN YOU WILL KNOW WHAT
A WISEACRE YOU ARE IN YOUR ADMONITION OF ME
SOCRATES DOES NOT A MAN CEASE FROM HIS THIRST AND FROM HIS PLEASURE IN
DRINKING AT THE SAME TIME
CALLICLES I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
GORGIAS NAY CALLICLES ANSWER IF ONLY FOR OUR SAKES WE SHOULD LIKE
TO HEAR THE ARGUMENT OUT
CALLICLES YES GORGIAS BUT I MUST COMPLAIN OF THE HABITUAL TRIFLING OF
SOCRATES HE IS ALWAYS ARGUING ABOUT LITTLE AND UNWORTHY QUESTIONS
GORGIAS WHAT MATTER YOUR REPUTATION CALLICLES IS NOT AT STAKE
LET
SOCRATES ARGUE IN HIS OWN FASHION
CALLICLES WELL THEN SOCRATES YOU SHALL ASK THESE LITTLE PEDDLING
QUESTIONS SINCE GORGIAS WISHES TO HAVE THEM
SOCRATES I ENVY YOU CALLICLES FOR HAVING BEEN INITIATED INTO THE
GREAT MYSTERIES BEFORE YOU WERE INITIATED INTO THE LESSER
I THOUGHT
THAT THIS WAS NOT ALLOWABLE
BUT TO RETURN TO OUR ARGUMENT DOES NOT A
MAN CEASE FROM THIRSTING AND FROM THE PLEASURE OF DRINKING AT THE SAME
MOMENT
CALLICLES TRUE
SOCRATES AND IF HE IS HUNGRY OR HAS ANY OTHER DESIRE DOES HE NOT
CEASE FROM THE DESIRE AND THE PLEASURE AT THE SAME MOMENT
CALLICLES VERY TRUE
SOCRATES THEN HE CEASES FROM PAIN AND PLEASURE AT THE SAME MOMENT
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES BUT HE DOES NOT CEASE FROM GOOD AND EVIL AT THE SAME MOMENT
AS YOU HAVE ADMITTED DO YOU STILL ADHERE TO WHAT YOU SAID
CALLICLES YES I DO BUT WHAT IS THE INFERENCE
SOCRATES WHY MY FRIEND THE INFERENCE IS THAT THE GOOD IS NOT THE
SAME AS THE PLEASANT OR THE EVIL THE SAME AS THE PAINFUL THERE IS A
CESSATION OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AT THE SAME MOMENT BUT NOT OF GOOD AND
EVIL FOR THEY ARE DIFFERENT
HOW THEN CAN PLEASURE BE THE SAME AS GOOD
OR PAIN AS EVIL AND I WOULD HAVE YOU LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER
LIGHT WHICH COULD HARDLY I THINK HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED BY YOU WHEN YOU
IDENTIFIED THEM ARE NOT THE GOOD GOOD BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD PRESENT
WITH THEM AS THE BEAUTIFUL ARE THOSE WHO HAVE BEAUTY PRESENT WITH THEM
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND DO YOU CALL THE FOOLS AND COWARDS GOOD MEN FOR YOU WERE
SAYING JUST NOW THAT THE COURAGEOUS AND THE WISE ARE THE GOOD WOULD YOU
NOT SAY SO
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND DID YOU NEVER SEE A FOOLISH CHILD REJOICING
CALLICLES YES I HAVE
SOCRATES AND A FOOLISH MAN TOO
CALLICLES YES CERTAINLY BUT WHAT IS YOUR DRIFT
SOCRATES NOTHING PARTICULAR IF YOU WILL ONLY ANSWER
CALLICLES YES I HAVE
SOCRATES AND DID YOU EVER SEE A SENSIBLE MAN REJOICING OR SORROWING
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES WHICH REJOICE AND SORROW MOST THE WISE OR THE FOOLISH
CALLICLES THEY ARE MUCH UPON A PAR I THINK IN THAT RESPECT
SOCRATES ENOUGH AND DID YOU EVER SEE A COWARD IN BATTLE
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES AND WHICH REJOICED MOST AT THE DEPARTURE OF THE ENEMY THE
COWARD OR THE BRAVE
CALLICLES I SHOULD SAY 'MOST' OF BOTH OR AT ANY RATE THEY REJOICED
ABOUT EQUALLY
SOCRATES NO MATTER THEN THE COWARDS AND NOT ONLY THE BRAVE REJOICE
CALLICLES GREATLY
SOCRATES AND THE FOOLISH SO IT WOULD SEEM
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND ARE ONLY THE COWARDS PAINED AT THE APPROACH OF THEIR
ENEMIES OR ARE THE BRAVE ALSO PAINED
CALLICLES BOTH ARE PAINED
SOCRATES AND ARE THEY EQUALLY PAINED
CALLICLES I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT THE COWARDS ARE MORE PAINED
SOCRATES AND ARE THEY NOT BETTER PLEASED AT THE ENEMY'S DEPARTURE
CALLICLES I DARE SAY
SOCRATES THEN ARE THE FOOLISH AND THE WISE AND THE COWARDS AND THE
BRAVE ALL PLEASED AND PAINED AS YOU WERE SAYING IN NEARLY EQUAL
DEGREE BUT ARE THE COWARDS MORE PLEASED AND PAINED THAN THE BRAVE
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES BUT SURELY THE WISE AND BRAVE ARE THE GOOD AND THE FOOLISH
AND THE COWARDLY ARE THE BAD
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THEN THE GOOD AND THE BAD ARE PLEASED AND PAINED IN A NEARLY
EQUAL DEGREE
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THEN ARE THE GOOD AND BAD GOOD AND BAD IN A NEARLY EQUAL
DEGREE OR HAVE THE BAD THE ADVANTAGE BOTH IN GOOD AND EVIL I E
IN
HAVING MORE PLEASURE AND MORE PAIN
CALLICLES I REALLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN
SOCRATES WHY DO YOU NOT REMEMBER SAYING THAT THE GOOD WERE GOOD
BECAUSE GOOD WAS PRESENT WITH THEM AND THE EVIL BECAUSE EVIL AND THAT
PLEASURES WERE GOODS AND PAINS EVILS
CALLICLES YES I REMEMBER
SOCRATES AND ARE NOT THESE PLEASURES OR GOODS PRESENT TO THOSE WHO
REJOICE IF THEY DO REJOICE
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THEN THOSE WHO REJOICE ARE GOOD WHEN GOODS ARE PRESENT WITH
THEM
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND THOSE WHO ARE IN PAIN HAVE EVIL OR SORROW PRESENT WITH
THEM
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND WOULD YOU STILL SAY THAT THE EVIL ARE EVIL BY REASON OF
THE PRESENCE OF EVIL
CALLICLES I SHOULD
SOCRATES THEN THOSE WHO REJOICE ARE GOOD AND THOSE WHO ARE IN PAIN
EVIL
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THE DEGREES OF GOOD AND EVIL VARY WITH THE DEGREES OF PLEASURE
AND OF PAIN
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES HAVE THE WISE MAN AND THE FOOL THE BRAVE AND THE COWARD JOY
AND PAIN IN NEARLY EQUAL DEGREES OR WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE COWARD HAS
MORE
CALLICLES I SHOULD SAY THAT HE HAS
SOCRATES HELP ME THEN TO DRAW OUT THE CONCLUSION WHICH FOLLOWS FROM OUR
ADMISSIONS FOR IT IS GOOD TO REPEAT AND REVIEW WHAT IS GOOD TWICE AND
THRICE OVER AS THEY SAY
BOTH THE WISE MAN AND THE BRAVE MAN WE ALLOW
TO BE GOOD
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND THE FOOLISH MAN AND THE COWARD TO BE EVIL
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND HE WHO HAS JOY IS GOOD
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND HE WHO IS IN PAIN IS EVIL
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES THE GOOD AND EVIL BOTH HAVE JOY AND PAIN BUT PERHAPS THE
EVIL HAS MORE OF THEM
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THEN MUST WE NOT INFER THAT THE BAD MAN IS AS GOOD AND BAD
AS THE GOOD OR PERHAPS EVEN BETTER IS NOT THIS A FURTHER INFERENCE
WHICH FOLLOWS EQUALLY WITH THE PRECEDING FROM THE ASSERTION THAT THE
GOOD AND THE PLEASANT ARE THE SAME CAN THIS BE DENIED CALLICLES
CALLICLES I HAVE BEEN LISTENING AND MAKING ADMISSIONS TO YOU SOCRATES
AND I REMARK THAT IF A PERSON GRANTS YOU ANYTHING IN PLAY YOU LIKE A
CHILD WANT TO KEEP HOLD AND WILL NOT GIVE IT BACK
BUT DO YOU REALLY
SUPPOSE THAT I OR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING DENIES THAT SOME PLEASURES ARE
GOOD AND OTHERS BAD
SOCRATES ALAS CALLICLES HOW UNFAIR YOU ARE YOU CERTAINLY TREAT ME AS
IF I WERE A CHILD SOMETIMES SAYING ONE THING AND THEN ANOTHER AS IF
YOU WERE MEANING TO DECEIVE ME
AND YET I THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT YOU WERE
MY FRIEND AND WOULD NOT HAVE DECEIVED ME IF YOU COULD HAVE HELPED
BUT
I SEE THAT I WAS MISTAKEN AND NOW I SUPPOSE THAT I MUST MAKE THE BEST
OF A BAD BUSINESS AS THEY SAID OF OLD AND TAKE WHAT I CAN GET OUT OF
YOU WELL THEN AS I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY I MAY ASSUME THAT SOME
PLEASURES ARE GOOD AND OTHERS EVIL
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THE BENEFICIAL ARE GOOD AND THE HURTFUL ARE EVIL
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES AND THE BENEFICIAL ARE THOSE WHICH DO SOME GOOD AND THE
HURTFUL ARE THOSE WHICH DO SOME EVIL
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE BODILY PLEASURES OF EATING AND
DRINKING WHICH WE WERE JUST NOW MENTIONING YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THOSE
WHICH PROMOTE HEALTH OR ANY OTHER BODILY EXCELLENCE ARE GOOD AND
THEIR OPPOSITES EVIL
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND IN THE SAME WAY THERE ARE GOOD PAINS AND THERE ARE EVIL
PAINS
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES AND OUGHT WE NOT TO CHOOSE AND USE THE GOOD PLEASURES AND
PAINS
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES BUT NOT THE EVIL
CALLICLES CLEARLY
SOCRATES BECAUSE IF YOU REMEMBER POLUS AND I HAVE AGREED THAT ALL
OUR ACTIONS ARE TO BE DONE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD AND WILL YOU AGREE
WITH US IN SAYING THAT THE GOOD IS THE END OF ALL OUR ACTIONS AND THAT
ALL OUR ACTIONS ARE TO BE DONE FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD AND NOT THE
GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF THEM WILL YOU ADD A THIRD VOTE TO OUR TWO
CALLICLES I WILL
SOCRATES THEN PLEASURE LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IS TO BE SOUGHT FOR THE
SAKE OF THAT WHICH IS GOOD AND NOT THAT WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF
PLEASURE
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES BUT CAN EVERY MAN CHOOSE WHAT PLEASURES ARE GOOD AND WHAT ARE
EVIL OR MUST HE HAVE ART OR KNOWLEDGE OF THEM IN DETAIL
CALLICLES HE MUST HAVE ART
SOCRATES LET ME NOW REMIND YOU OF WHAT I WAS SAYING TO GORGIAS AND
POLUS I WAS SAYING AS YOU WILL NOT HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THERE WERE
SOME PROCESSES WHICH AIM ONLY AT PLEASURE AND KNOW NOTHING OF A BETTER
AND WORSE AND THERE ARE OTHER PROCESSES WHICH KNOW GOOD AND EVIL
AND
I CONSIDERED THAT COOKERY WHICH I DO NOT CALL AN ART BUT ONLY AN
EXPERIENCE WAS OF THE FORMER CLASS WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH PLEASURE
AND THAT THE ART OF MEDICINE WAS OF THE CLASS WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH
THE GOOD
AND NOW BY THE GOD OF FRIENDSHIP I MUST BEG YOU CALLICLES
NOT TO JEST OR TO IMAGINE THAT I AM JESTING WITH YOU DO NOT ANSWER AT
RANDOM AND CONTRARY TO YOUR REAL OPINION FOR YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT WE
ARE ARGUING ABOUT THE WAY OF HUMAN LIFE AND TO A MAN WHO HAS ANY SENSE
AT ALL WHAT QUESTION CAN BE MORE SERIOUS THAN THIS WHETHER HE SHOULD
FOLLOW AFTER THAT WAY OF LIFE TO WHICH YOU EXHORT ME AND ACT WHAT
YOU CALL THE MANLY PART OF SPEAKING IN THE ASSEMBLY AND CULTIVATING
RHETORIC AND ENGAGING IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES
NOW IN VOGUE OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PURSUE THE LIFE OF PHILOSOPHY AND
IN WHAT THE LATTER WAY DIFFERS FROM THE FORMER
BUT PERHAPS WE HAD
BETTER FIRST TRY TO DISTINGUISH THEM AS I DID BEFORE AND WHEN WE HAVE
COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY ARE DISTINCT WE MAY PROCEED TO CONSIDER
IN WHAT THEY DIFFER FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WHICH OF THEM WE SHOULD
CHOOSE
PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU DO NOT EVEN NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN
CALLICLES NO I DO NOT
SOCRATES THEN I WILL EXPLAIN MYSELF MORE CLEARLY SEEING THAT YOU AND I
HAVE AGREED THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING AS GOOD AND THAT THERE IS SUCH
A THING AS PLEASURE AND THAT PLEASURE IS NOT THE SAME AS GOOD AND THAT
THE PURSUIT AND PROCESS OF ACQUISITION OF THE ONE THAT IS PLEASURE
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE PURSUIT AND PROCESS OF ACQUISITION OF THE OTHER
WHICH IS GOOD I WISH THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME
THUS FAR OR NOT DO YOU AGREE
CALLICLES I DO
SOCRATES THEN I WILL PROCEED AND ASK WHETHER YOU ALSO AGREE WITH ME
AND WHETHER YOU THINK THAT I SPOKE THE TRUTH WHEN I FURTHER SAID TO
GORGIAS AND POLUS THAT COOKERY IN MY OPINION IS ONLY AN EXPERIENCE AND
NOT AN ART AT ALL AND THAT WHEREAS MEDICINE IS AN ART AND ATTENDS TO
THE NATURE AND CONSTITUTION OF THE PATIENT AND HAS PRINCIPLES OF
ACTION AND REASON IN EACH CASE COOKERY IN ATTENDING UPON PLEASURE
NEVER REGARDS EITHER THE NATURE OR REASON OF THAT PLEASURE TO WHICH SHE
DEVOTES HERSELF BUT GOES STRAIGHT TO HER END NOR EVER CONSIDERS OR
CALCULATES ANYTHING BUT WORKS BY EXPERIENCE AND ROUTINE AND JUST
PRESERVES THE RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAS USUALLY DONE WHEN PRODUCING
PLEASURE
AND FIRST I WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDER WHETHER I HAVE PROVED
WHAT I WAS SAYING AND THEN WHETHER THERE ARE NOT OTHER SIMILAR
PROCESSES WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH THE SOUL SOME OF THEM PROCESSES OF ART
MAKING A PROVISION FOR THE SOUL'S HIGHEST INTEREST OTHERS DESPISING THE
INTEREST AND AS IN THE PREVIOUS CASE CONSIDERING ONLY THE PLEASURE
OF THE SOUL AND HOW THIS MAY BE ACQUIRED BUT NOT CONSIDERING WHAT
PLEASURES ARE GOOD OR BAD AND HAVING NO OTHER AIM BUT TO AFFORD
GRATIFICATION WHETHER GOOD OR BAD
IN MY OPINION CALLICLES THERE ARE
SUCH PROCESSES AND THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WHICH I TERM FLATTERY
WHETHER CONCERNED WITH THE BODY OR THE SOUL OR WHENEVER EMPLOYED WITH A
VIEW TO PLEASURE AND WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OF GOOD AND EVIL
AND NOW
I WISH THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH US IN THIS NOTION
OR WHETHER YOU DIFFER
CALLICLES I DO NOT DIFFER ON THE CONTRARY I AGREE FOR IN THAT WAY I
SHALL SOONEST BRING THE ARGUMENT TO AN END AND SHALL OBLIGE MY FRIEND
GORGIAS
SOCRATES AND IS THIS NOTION TRUE OF ONE SOUL OR OF TWO OR MORE
CALLICLES EQUALLY TRUE OF TWO OR MORE
SOCRATES THEN A MAN MAY DELIGHT A WHOLE ASSEMBLY AND YET HAVE NO
REGARD FOR THEIR TRUE INTERESTS
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES CAN YOU TELL ME THE PURSUITS WHICH DELIGHT MANKIND OR RATHER
IF YOU WOULD PREFER LET ME ASK AND DO YOU ANSWER WHICH OF THEM BELONG
TO THE PLEASURABLE CLASS AND WHICH OF THEM NOT IN THE FIRST PLACE
WHAT SAY YOU OF FLUTE PLAYING DOES NOT THAT APPEAR TO BE AN ART WHICH
SEEKS ONLY PLEASURE CALLICLES AND THINKS OF NOTHING ELSE
CALLICLES I ASSENT
SOCRATES AND IS NOT THE SAME TRUE OF ALL SIMILAR ARTS AS FOR EXAMPLE
THE ART OF PLAYING THE LYRE AT FESTIVALS
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OF THE CHORAL ART AND OF DITHYRAMBIC
POETRY ARE NOT THEY OF THE SAME NATURE DO YOU IMAGINE THAT CINESIAS
THE SON OF MELES CARES ABOUT WHAT WILL TEND TO THE MORAL IMPROVEMENT OF
HIS HEARERS OR ABOUT WHAT WILL GIVE PLEASURE TO THE MULTITUDE
CALLICLES THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT CINESIAS SOCRATES
SOCRATES AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OF HIS FATHER MELES THE HARP PLAYER DID
HE PERFORM WITH ANY VIEW TO THE GOOD OF HIS HEARERS COULD HE BE SAID
TO REGARD EVEN THEIR PLEASURE FOR HIS SINGING WAS AN INFLICTION TO HIS
AUDIENCE
AND OF HARP PLAYING AND DITHYRAMBIC POETRY IN GENERAL WHAT
WOULD YOU SAY HAVE THEY NOT BEEN INVENTED WHOLLY FOR THE SAKE OF
PLEASURE
CALLICLES THAT IS MY NOTION OF THEM
SOCRATES AND AS FOR THE MUSE OF TRAGEDY THAT SOLEMN AND AUGUST
PERSONAGE WHAT ARE HER ASPIRATIONS IS ALL HER AIM AND DESIRE ONLY
TO GIVE PLEASURE TO THE SPECTATORS OR DOES SHE FIGHT AGAINST THEM AND
REFUSE TO SPEAK OF THEIR PLEASANT VICES AND WILLINGLY PROCLAIM IN WORD
AND SONG TRUTHS WELCOME AND UNWELCOME WHICH IN YOUR JUDGMENT IS HER
CHARACTER
CALLICLES THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT SOCRATES THAT TRAGEDY HAS HER FACE
TURNED TOWARDS PLEASURE AND THE GRATIFICATION OF THE AUDIENCE
SOCRATES AND IS NOT THAT THE SORT OF THING CALLICLES WHICH WE WERE
JUST NOW DESCRIBING AS FLATTERY
CALLICLES QUITE TRUE
SOCRATES WELL NOW SUPPOSE THAT WE STRIP ALL POETRY OF SONG AND RHYTHM
AND METRE THERE WILL REMAIN SPEECH COMPARE REPUBLIC
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES AND THIS SPEECH IS ADDRESSED TO A CROWD OF PEOPLE
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THEN POETRY IS A SORT OF RHETORIC
CALLICLES TRUE
SOCRATES AND DO NOT THE POETS IN THE THEATRES SEEM TO YOU TO BE
RHETORICIANS
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THEN NOW WE HAVE DISCOVERED A SORT OF RHETORIC WHICH IS
ADDRESSED TO A CROWD OF MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN FREEMEN AND SLAVES
AND THIS IS NOT MUCH TO OUR TASTE FOR WE HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS HAVING
THE NATURE OF FLATTERY
CALLICLES QUITE TRUE
SOCRATES VERY GOOD
AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OF THAT OTHER RHETORIC WHICH
ADDRESSES THE ATHENIAN ASSEMBLY AND THE ASSEMBLIES OF FREEMEN IN OTHER
STATES DO THE RHETORICIANS APPEAR TO YOU ALWAYS TO AIM AT WHAT IS BEST
AND DO THEY SEEK TO IMPROVE THE CITIZENS BY THEIR SPEECHES OR ARE
THEY TOO LIKE THE REST OF MANKIND BENT UPON GIVING THEM PLEASURE
FORGETTING THE PUBLIC GOOD IN THE THOUGHT OF THEIR OWN INTEREST PLAYING
WITH THE PEOPLE AS WITH CHILDREN AND TRYING TO AMUSE THEM BUT NEVER
CONSIDERING WHETHER THEY ARE BETTER OR WORSE FOR THIS
CALLICLES I MUST DISTINGUISH
THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE A REAL CARE OF
THE PUBLIC IN WHAT THEY SAY WHILE OTHERS ARE SUCH AS YOU DESCRIBE
SOCRATES I AM CONTENTED WITH THE ADMISSION THAT RHETORIC IS OF TWO
SORTS ONE WHICH IS MERE FLATTERY AND DISGRACEFUL DECLAMATION THE
OTHER WHICH IS NOBLE AND AIMS AT THE TRAINING AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE
SOULS OF THE CITIZENS AND STRIVES TO SAY WHAT IS BEST WHETHER WELCOME
OR UNWELCOME TO THE AUDIENCE BUT HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN SUCH A RHETORIC
OR IF YOU HAVE AND CAN POINT OUT ANY RHETORICIAN WHO IS OF THIS STAMP
WHO IS HE
CALLICLES BUT INDEED I AM AFRAID THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU OF ANY SUCH
AMONG THE ORATORS WHO ARE AT PRESENT LIVING
SOCRATES WELL THEN CAN YOU MENTION ANY ONE OF A FORMER GENERATION
WHO MAY BE SAID TO HAVE IMPROVED THE ATHENIANS WHO FOUND THEM WORSE
AND MADE THEM BETTER FROM THE DAY THAT HE BEGAN TO MAKE SPEECHES FOR
INDEED I DO NOT KNOW OF SUCH A MAN
CALLICLES WHAT DID YOU NEVER HEAR THAT THEMISTOCLES WAS A GOOD MAN
AND CIMON AND MILTIADES AND PERICLES WHO IS JUST LATELY DEAD AND WHOM
YOU HEARD YOURSELF
SOCRATES YES CALLICLES THEY WERE GOOD MEN IF AS YOU SAID AT FIRST
TRUE VIRTUE CONSISTS ONLY IN THE SATISFACTION OF OUR OWN DESIRES AND
THOSE OF OTHERS BUT IF NOT AND IF AS WE WERE AFTERWARDS COMPELLED TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THE SATISFACTION OF SOME DESIRES MAKES US BETTER AND OF
OTHERS WORSE AND WE OUGHT TO GRATIFY THE ONE AND NOT THE OTHER AND
THERE IS AN ART IN DISTINGUISHING THEM CAN YOU TELL ME OF ANY OF THESE
STATESMEN WHO DID DISTINGUISH THEM
CALLICLES NO INDEED I CANNOT
SOCRATES YET SURELY CALLICLES IF YOU LOOK YOU WILL FIND SUCH A ONE
SUPPOSE THAT WE JUST CALMLY CONSIDER WHETHER ANY OF THESE WAS SUCH AS I
HAVE DESCRIBED
WILL NOT THE GOOD MAN WHO SAYS WHATEVER HE SAYS WITH
A VIEW TO THE BEST SPEAK WITH A REFERENCE TO SOME STANDARD AND NOT AT
RANDOM JUST AS ALL OTHER ARTISTS WHETHER THE PAINTER THE BUILDER THE
SHIPWRIGHT OR ANY OTHER LOOK ALL OF THEM TO THEIR OWN WORK AND DO
NOT SELECT AND APPLY AT RANDOM WHAT THEY APPLY BUT STRIVE TO GIVE
A DEFINITE FORM TO IT THE ARTIST DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN ORDER AND
COMPELS THE ONE PART TO HARMONIZE AND ACCORD WITH THE OTHER PART UNTIL
HE HAS CONSTRUCTED A REGULAR AND SYSTEMATIC WHOLE AND THIS IS TRUE OF
ALL ARTISTS AND IN THE SAME WAY THE TRAINERS AND PHYSICIANS OF WHOM WE
SPOKE BEFORE GIVE ORDER AND REGULARITY TO THE BODY DO YOU DENY THIS
CALLICLES NO I AM READY TO ADMIT IT
SOCRATES THEN THE HOUSE IN WHICH ORDER AND REGULARITY PREVAIL IS GOOD
THAT IN WHICH THERE IS DISORDER EVIL
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF A SHIP
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE HUMAN BODY
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY OF THE SOUL WILL THE GOOD SOUL BE THAT
IN WHICH DISORDER IS PREVALENT OR THAT IN WHICH THERE IS HARMONY AND
ORDER
CALLICLES THE LATTER FOLLOWS FROM OUR PREVIOUS ADMISSIONS
SOCRATES WHAT IS THE NAME WHICH IS GIVEN TO THE EFFECT OF HARMONY AND
ORDER IN THE BODY
CALLICLES I SUPPOSE THAT YOU MEAN HEALTH AND STRENGTH
SOCRATES YES I DO AND WHAT IS THE NAME WHICH YOU WOULD GIVE TO THE
EFFECT OF HARMONY AND ORDER IN THE SOUL TRY AND DISCOVER A NAME FOR
THIS AS WELL AS FOR THE OTHER
CALLICLES WHY NOT GIVE THE NAME YOURSELF SOCRATES
SOCRATES WELL IF YOU HAD RATHER THAT I SHOULD I WILL AND YOU SHALL
SAY WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH ME AND IF NOT YOU SHALL REFUTE AND ANSWER
ME
'HEALTHY AS I CONCEIVE IS THE NAME WHICH IS GIVEN TO THE
REGULAR ORDER OF THE BODY WHENCE COMES HEALTH AND EVERY OTHER BODILY
EXCELLENCE IS THAT TRUE OR NOT
CALLICLES TRUE
SOCRATES AND 'LAWFUL' AND 'LAW' ARE THE NAMES WHICH ARE GIVEN TO THE
REGULAR ORDER AND ACTION OF THE SOUL AND THESE MAKE MEN LAWFUL AND
ORDERLY AND SO WE HAVE TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE HAVE WE NOT
CALLICLES GRANTED
SOCRATES AND WILL NOT THE TRUE RHETORICIAN WHO IS HONEST AND
UNDERSTANDS HIS ART HAVE HIS EYE FIXED UPON THESE IN ALL THE WORDS
WHICH HE ADDRESSES TO THE SOULS OF MEN AND IN ALL HIS ACTIONS BOTH IN
WHAT HE GIVES AND IN WHAT HE TAKES AWAY WILL NOT HIS AIM BE TO IMPLANT
JUSTICE IN THE SOULS OF HIS CITIZENS AND TAKE AWAY INJUSTICE TO IMPLANT
TEMPERANCE AND TAKE AWAY INTEMPERANCE TO IMPLANT EVERY VIRTUE AND TAKE
AWAY EVERY VICE DO YOU NOT AGREE
CALLICLES I AGREE
SOCRATES FOR WHAT USE IS THERE CALLICLES IN GIVING TO THE BODY OF
A SICK MAN WHO IS IN A BAD STATE OF HEALTH A QUANTITY OF THE MOST
DELIGHTFUL FOOD OR DRINK OR ANY OTHER PLEASANT THING WHICH MAY BE
REALLY AS BAD FOR HIM AS IF YOU GAVE HIM NOTHING OR EVEN WORSE IF
RIGHTLY ESTIMATED
IS NOT THAT TRUE
CALLICLES I WILL NOT SAY NO TO IT
SOCRATES FOR IN MY OPINION THERE IS NO PROFIT IN A MAN'S LIFE IF HIS
BODY IS IN AN EVIL PLIGHT IN THAT CASE HIS LIFE ALSO IS EVIL AM I NOT
RIGHT
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES WHEN A MAN IS IN HEALTH THE PHYSICIANS WILL GENERALLY ALLOW
HIM TO EAT WHEN HE IS HUNGRY AND DRINK WHEN HE IS THIRSTY AND TO
SATISFY HIS DESIRES AS HE LIKES BUT WHEN HE IS SICK THEY HARDLY SUFFER
HIM TO SATISFY HIS DESIRES AT ALL EVEN YOU WILL ADMIT THAT
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND DOES NOT THE SAME ARGUMENT HOLD OF THE SOUL MY GOOD SIR
WHILE SHE IS IN A BAD STATE AND IS SENSELESS AND INTEMPERATE AND UNJUST
AND UNHOLY HER DESIRES OUGHT TO BE CONTROLLED AND SHE OUGHT TO
BE PREVENTED FROM DOING ANYTHING WHICH DOES NOT TEND TO HER OWN
IMPROVEMENT
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES SUCH TREATMENT WILL BE BETTER FOR THE SOUL HERSELF
CALLICLES TO BE SURE
SOCRATES AND TO RESTRAIN HER FROM HER APPETITES IS TO CHASTISE HER
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THEN RESTRAINT OR CHASTISEMENT IS BETTER FOR THE SOUL
THAN INTEMPERANCE OR THE ABSENCE OF CONTROL WHICH YOU WERE JUST NOW
PREFERRING
CALLICLES I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU SOCRATES AND I WISH THAT YOU WOULD
ASK SOME ONE WHO DOES
SOCRATES HERE IS A GENTLEMAN WHO CANNOT ENDURE TO BE IMPROVED OR TO
SUBJECT HIMSELF TO THAT VERY CHASTISEMENT OF WHICH THE ARGUMENT SPEAKS
CALLICLES I DO NOT HEED A WORD OF WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND HAVE ONLY
ANSWERED HITHERTO OUT OF CIVILITY TO GORGIAS
SOCRATES WHAT ARE WE TO DO THEN SHALL WE BREAK OFF IN THE MIDDLE
CALLICLES YOU SHALL JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
SOCRATES WELL BUT PEOPLE SAY THAT 'A TALE SHOULD HAVE A HEAD AND NOT
BREAK OFF IN THE MIDDLE AND I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE THE ARGUMENT
GOING ABOUT WITHOUT A HEAD COMPARE LAWS PLEASE THEN TO GO ON A LITTLE
LONGER AND PUT THE HEAD ON
CALLICLES HOW TYRANNICAL YOU ARE SOCRATES I WISH THAT YOU AND YOUR
ARGUMENT WOULD REST OR THAT YOU WOULD GET SOME ONE ELSE TO ARGUE WITH
YOU
SOCRATES BUT WHO ELSE IS WILLING I WANT TO FINISH THE ARGUMENT
CALLICLES CANNOT YOU FINISH WITHOUT MY HELP EITHER TALKING STRAIGHT
ON OR QUESTIONING AND ANSWERING YOURSELF
SOCRATES MUST I THEN SAY WITH EPICHARMUS 'TWO MEN SPOKE BEFORE BUT
NOW ONE SHALL BE ENOUGH' I SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO HELP
AND IF I AM TO CARRY ON THE ENQUIRY BY MYSELF I WILL FIRST OF ALL
REMARK THAT NOT ONLY I BUT ALL OF US SHOULD HAVE AN AMBITION TO KNOW
WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS FALSE IN THIS MATTER FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE
TRUTH IS A COMMON GOOD
AND NOW I WILL PROCEED TO ARGUE ACCORDING TO MY
OWN NOTION
BUT IF ANY OF YOU THINK THAT I ARRIVE AT CONCLUSIONS WHICH
ARE UNTRUE YOU MUST INTERPOSE AND REFUTE ME FOR I DO NOT SPEAK FROM
ANY KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT I AM SAYING I AM AN ENQUIRER LIKE YOURSELVES AND
THEREFORE IF MY OPPONENT SAYS ANYTHING WHICH IS OF FORCE I SHALL BE
THE FIRST TO AGREE WITH HIM
I AM SPEAKING ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE
ARGUMENT OUGHT TO BE COMPLETED BUT IF YOU THINK OTHERWISE LET US LEAVE
OFF AND GO OUR WAYS
GORGIAS I THINK SOCRATES THAT WE SHOULD NOT GO OUR WAYS UNTIL YOU
HAVE COMPLETED THE ARGUMENT AND THIS APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE WISH OF
THE REST OF THE COMPANY I MYSELF SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR WHAT
MORE YOU HAVE TO SAY
SOCRATES I TOO GORGIAS SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO CONTINUE THE ARGUMENT
WITH CALLICLES AND THEN I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN HIM AN 'AMPHION' IN RETURN
FOR HIS 'ZETHUS' BUT SINCE YOU CALLICLES ARE UNWILLING TO CONTINUE
I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LISTEN AND INTERRUPT ME IF I SEEM TO YOU TO BE IN
ERROR
AND IF YOU REFUTE ME I SHALL NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOU AS YOU ARE
WITH ME BUT I SHALL INSCRIBE YOU AS THE GREATEST OF BENEFACTORS ON THE
TABLETS OF MY SOUL
CALLICLES MY GOOD FELLOW NEVER MIND ME BUT GET ON
SOCRATES LISTEN TO ME THEN WHILE I RECAPITULATE THE ARGUMENT IS THE
PLEASANT THE SAME AS THE GOOD NOT THE SAME
CALLICLES AND I ARE AGREED
ABOUT THAT
AND IS THE PLEASANT TO BE PURSUED FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD
OR THE GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF THE PLEASANT THE PLEASANT IS TO BE PURSUED
FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD
AND THAT IS PLEASANT AT THE PRESENCE OF WHICH
WE ARE PLEASED AND THAT IS GOOD AT THE PRESENCE OF WHICH WE ARE GOOD
TO BE SURE
AND WE ARE GOOD AND ALL GOOD THINGS WHATEVER ARE GOOD WHEN
SOME VIRTUE IS PRESENT IN US OR THEM THAT CALLICLES IS MY CONVICTION
BUT THE VIRTUE OF EACH THING WHETHER BODY OR SOUL INSTRUMENT OR
CREATURE WHEN GIVEN TO THEM IN THE BEST WAY COMES TO THEM NOT BY CHANCE
BUT AS THE RESULT OF THE ORDER AND TRUTH AND ART WHICH ARE IMPARTED TO
THEM AM I NOT RIGHT I MAINTAIN THAT I AM
AND IS NOT THE VIRTUE OF
EACH THING DEPENDENT ON ORDER OR ARRANGEMENT YES I SAY
AND THAT WHICH
MAKES A THING GOOD IS THE PROPER ORDER INHERING IN EACH THING SUCH IS
MY VIEW
AND IS NOT THE SOUL WHICH HAS AN ORDER OF HER OWN BETTER THAN
THAT WHICH HAS NO ORDER CERTAINLY
AND THE SOUL WHICH HAS ORDER IS
ORDERLY OF COURSE
AND THAT WHICH IS ORDERLY IS TEMPERATE ASSUREDLY
AND THE TEMPERATE SOUL IS GOOD NO OTHER ANSWER CAN I GIVE CALLICLES
DEAR HAVE YOU ANY
CALLICLES GO ON MY GOOD FELLOW
SOCRATES THEN I SHALL PROCEED TO ADD THAT IF THE TEMPERATE SOUL IS
THE GOOD SOUL THE SOUL WHICH IS IN THE OPPOSITE CONDITION THAT IS THE
FOOLISH AND INTEMPERATE IS THE BAD SOUL
VERY TRUE
AND WILL NOT THE TEMPERATE MAN DO WHAT IS PROPER BOTH IN RELATION
TO THE GODS AND TO MEN FOR HE WOULD NOT BE TEMPERATE IF HE DID NOT
CERTAINLY HE WILL DO WHAT IS PROPER
IN HIS RELATION TO OTHER MEN HE
WILL DO WHAT IS JUST AND IN HIS RELATION TO THE GODS HE WILL DO WHAT IS
HOLY AND HE WHO DOES WHAT IS JUST AND HOLY MUST BE JUST AND HOLY VERY
TRUE
AND MUST HE NOT BE COURAGEOUS FOR THE DUTY OF A TEMPERATE MAN IS
NOT TO FOLLOW OR TO AVOID WHAT HE OUGHT NOT BUT WHAT HE OUGHT WHETHER
THINGS OR MEN OR PLEASURES OR PAINS AND PATIENTLY TO ENDURE WHEN HE
OUGHT AND THEREFORE CALLICLES THE TEMPERATE MAN BEING AS WE HAVE
DESCRIBED ALSO JUST AND COURAGEOUS AND HOLY CANNOT BE OTHER THAN A
PERFECTLY GOOD MAN NOR CAN THE GOOD MAN DO OTHERWISE THAN WELL AND
PERFECTLY WHATEVER HE DOES AND HE WHO DOES WELL MUST OF NECESSITY BE
HAPPY AND BLESSED AND THE EVIL MAN WHO DOES EVIL MISERABLE NOW
THIS LATTER IS HE WHOM YOU WERE APPLAUDING THE INTEMPERATE WHO IS
THE OPPOSITE OF THE TEMPERATE
SUCH IS MY POSITION AND THESE THINGS I
AFFIRM TO BE TRUE
AND IF THEY ARE TRUE THEN I FURTHER AFFIRM THAT HE
WHO DESIRES TO BE HAPPY MUST PURSUE AND PRACTISE TEMPERANCE AND RUN
AWAY FROM INTEMPERANCE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS WILL CARRY HIM HE HAD BETTER
ORDER HIS LIFE SO AS NOT TO NEED PUNISHMENT BUT IF EITHER HE OR ANY
OF HIS FRIENDS WHETHER PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL OR CITY ARE IN NEED OF
PUNISHMENT THEN JUSTICE MUST BE DONE AND HE MUST SUFFER PUNISHMENT IF
HE WOULD BE HAPPY
THIS APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE AIM WHICH A MAN OUGHT
TO HAVE AND TOWARDS WHICH HE OUGHT TO DIRECT ALL THE ENERGIES BOTH
OF HIMSELF AND OF THE STATE ACTING SO THAT HE MAY HAVE TEMPERANCE AND
JUSTICE PRESENT WITH HIM AND BE HAPPY NOT SUFFERING HIS LUSTS TO BE
UNRESTRAINED AND IN THE NEVER ENDING DESIRE SATISFY THEM LEADING A
ROBBER'S LIFE
SUCH A ONE IS THE FRIEND NEITHER OF GOD NOR MAN FOR HE
IS INCAPABLE OF COMMUNION AND HE WHO IS INCAPABLE OF COMMUNION IS
ALSO INCAPABLE OF FRIENDSHIP
AND PHILOSOPHERS TELL US CALLICLES THAT
COMMUNION AND FRIENDSHIP AND ORDERLINESS AND TEMPERANCE AND JUSTICE BIND
TOGETHER HEAVEN AND EARTH AND GODS AND MEN AND THAT THIS UNIVERSE IS
THEREFORE CALLED COSMOS OR ORDER NOT DISORDER OR MISRULE MY FRIEND
BUT ALTHOUGH YOU ARE A PHILOSOPHER YOU SEEM TO ME NEVER TO HAVE OBSERVED
THAT GEOMETRICAL EQUALITY IS MIGHTY BOTH AMONG GODS AND MEN YOU THINK
THAT YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE INEQUALITY OR EXCESS AND DO NOT CARE ABOUT
GEOMETRY WELL THEN EITHER THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE HAPPY ARE MADE
HAPPY BY THE POSSESSION OF JUSTICE AND TEMPERANCE AND THE MISERABLE
MISERABLE BY THE POSSESSION OF VICE MUST BE REFUTED OR IF IT IS
GRANTED WHAT WILL BE THE CONSEQUENCES ALL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH I
DREW BEFORE CALLICLES AND ABOUT WHICH YOU ASKED ME WHETHER I WAS IN
EARNEST WHEN I SAID THAT A MAN OUGHT TO ACCUSE HIMSELF AND HIS SON AND
HIS FRIEND IF HE DID ANYTHING WRONG AND THAT TO THIS END HE SHOULD
USE HIS RHETORIC ALL THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE TRUE
AND THAT WHICH YOU
THOUGHT THAT POLUS WAS LED TO ADMIT OUT OF MODESTY IS TRUE VIZ THAT
TO DO INJUSTICE IF MORE DISGRACEFUL THAN TO SUFFER IS IN THAT DEGREE
WORSE AND THE OTHER POSITION WHICH ACCORDING TO POLUS GORGIAS
ADMITTED OUT OF MODESTY THAT HE WHO WOULD TRULY BE A RHETORICIAN OUGHT
TO BE JUST AND HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF JUSTICE HAS ALSO TURNED OUT TO BE
TRUE
AND NOW THESE THINGS BEING AS WE HAVE SAID LET US PROCEED IN THE NEXT
PLACE TO CONSIDER WHETHER YOU ARE RIGHT IN THROWING IN MY TEETH THAT
I AM UNABLE TO HELP MYSELF OR ANY OF MY FRIENDS OR KINSMEN OR TO SAVE
THEM IN THE EXTREMITY OF DANGER AND THAT I AM IN THE POWER OF ANOTHER
LIKE AN OUTLAW TO WHOM ANY ONE MAY DO WHAT HE LIKES HE MAY BOX MY
EARS WHICH WAS A BRAVE SAYING OF YOURS OR TAKE AWAY MY GOODS OR BANISH
ME OR EVEN DO HIS WORST AND KILL ME A CONDITION WHICH AS YOU SAY IS
THE HEIGHT OF DISGRACE
MY ANSWER TO YOU IS ONE WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY
OFTEN REPEATED BUT MAY AS WELL BE REPEATED ONCE MORE
I TELL YOU
CALLICLES THAT TO BE BOXED ON THE EARS WRONGFULLY IS NOT THE WORST EVIL
WHICH CAN BEFALL A MAN NOR TO HAVE MY PURSE OR MY BODY CUT OPEN BUT
THAT TO SMITE AND SLAY ME AND MINE WRONGFULLY IS FAR MORE DISGRACEFUL
AND MORE EVIL AYE AND TO DESPOIL AND ENSLAVE AND PILLAGE OR IN ANY
WAY AT ALL TO WRONG ME AND MINE IS FAR MORE DISGRACEFUL AND EVIL TO THE
DOER OF THE WRONG THAN TO ME WHO AM THE SUFFERER
THESE TRUTHS WHICH
HAVE BEEN ALREADY SET FORTH AS I STATE THEM IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
WOULD SEEM NOW TO HAVE BEEN FIXED AND RIVETED BY US IF I MAY USE AN
EXPRESSION WHICH IS CERTAINLY BOLD IN WORDS WHICH ARE LIKE BONDS OF
IRON AND ADAMANT AND UNLESS YOU OR SOME OTHER STILL MORE ENTERPRISING
HERO SHALL BREAK THEM THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF DENYING WHAT I SAY
FOR MY POSITION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT I MYSELF AM IGNORANT HOW THESE
THINGS ARE BUT THAT I HAVE NEVER MET ANY ONE WHO COULD SAY OTHERWISE
ANY MORE THAN YOU CAN AND NOT APPEAR RIDICULOUS
THIS IS MY POSITION
STILL AND IF WHAT I AM SAYING IS TRUE AND INJUSTICE IS THE GREATEST OF
EVILS TO THE DOER OF INJUSTICE AND YET THERE IS IF POSSIBLE A GREATER
THAN THIS GREATEST OF EVILS COMPARE REPUBLIC IN AN UNJUST MAN NOT
SUFFERING RETRIBUTION WHAT IS THAT DEFENCE OF WHICH THE WANT WILL MAKE
A MAN TRULY RIDICULOUS MUST NOT THE DEFENCE BE ONE WHICH WILL AVERT THE
GREATEST OF HUMAN EVILS AND WILL NOT THE WORST OF ALL DEFENCES BE
THAT WITH WHICH A MAN IS UNABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF OR HIS FAMILY OR HIS
FRIENDS AND NEXT WILL COME THAT WHICH IS UNABLE TO AVERT THE NEXT
GREATEST EVIL THIRDLY THAT WHICH IS UNABLE TO AVERT THE THIRD GREATEST
EVIL AND SO OF OTHER EVILS
AS IS THE GREATNESS OF EVIL SO IS THE
HONOUR OF BEING ABLE TO AVERT THEM IN THEIR SEVERAL DEGREES AND THE
DISGRACE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO AVERT THEM
AM I NOT RIGHT CALLICLES
CALLICLES YES QUITE RIGHT
SOCRATES SEEING THEN THAT THERE ARE THESE TWO EVILS THE DOING
INJUSTICE AND THE SUFFERING INJUSTICE AND WE AFFIRM THAT TO DO
INJUSTICE IS A GREATER AND TO SUFFER INJUSTICE A LESSER EVIL BY WHAT
DEVICES CAN A MAN SUCCEED IN OBTAINING THE TWO ADVANTAGES THE ONE OF
NOT DOING AND THE OTHER OF NOT SUFFERING INJUSTICE MUST HE HAVE THE
POWER OR ONLY THE WILL TO OBTAIN THEM I MEAN TO ASK WHETHER A MAN
WILL ESCAPE INJUSTICE IF HE HAS ONLY THE WILL TO ESCAPE OR MUST HE HAVE
PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH THE POWER
CALLICLES HE MUST HAVE PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH THE POWER THAT IS CLEAR
SOCRATES AND WHAT DO YOU SAY OF DOING INJUSTICE IS THE WILL ONLY
SUFFICIENT AND WILL THAT PREVENT HIM FROM DOING INJUSTICE OR MUST HE
HAVE PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH POWER AND ART AND IF HE HAVE NOT STUDIED
AND PRACTISED WILL HE BE UNJUST STILL SURELY YOU MIGHT SAY CALLICLES
WHETHER YOU THINK THAT POLUS AND I WERE RIGHT IN ADMITTING THE
CONCLUSION THAT NO ONE DOES WRONG VOLUNTARILY BUT THAT ALL DO WRONG
AGAINST THEIR WILL
CALLICLES GRANTED SOCRATES IF YOU WILL ONLY HAVE DONE
SOCRATES THEN AS WOULD APPEAR POWER AND ART HAVE TO BE PROVIDED IN
ORDER THAT WE MAY DO NO INJUSTICE
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND WHAT ART WILL PROTECT US FROM SUFFERING INJUSTICE IF NOT
WHOLLY YET AS FAR AS POSSIBLE I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH
ME FOR I THINK THAT SUCH AN ART IS THE ART OF ONE WHO IS EITHER A RULER
OR EVEN TYRANT HIMSELF OR THE EQUAL AND COMPANION OF THE RULING POWER
CALLICLES WELL SAID SOCRATES AND PLEASE TO OBSERVE HOW READY I AM TO
PRAISE YOU WHEN YOU TALK SENSE
SOCRATES THINK AND TELL ME WHETHER YOU WOULD APPROVE OF ANOTHER VIEW OF
MINE TO ME EVERY MAN APPEARS TO BE MOST THE FRIEND OF HIM WHO IS MOST
LIKE TO HIM LIKE TO LIKE AS ANCIENT SAGES SAY WOULD YOU NOT AGREE TO
THIS
CALLICLES I SHOULD
SOCRATES BUT WHEN THE TYRANT IS RUDE AND UNEDUCATED HE MAY BE EXPECTED
TO FEAR ANY ONE WHO IS HIS SUPERIOR IN VIRTUE AND WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO
BE PERFECTLY FRIENDLY WITH HIM
CALLICLES THAT IS TRUE
SOCRATES NEITHER WILL HE BE THE FRIEND OF ANY ONE WHO IS GREATLY HIS
INFERIOR FOR THE TYRANT WILL DESPISE HIM AND WILL NEVER SERIOUSLY
REGARD HIM AS A FRIEND
CALLICLES THAT AGAIN IS TRUE
SOCRATES THEN THE ONLY FRIEND WORTH MENTIONING WHOM THE TYRANT CAN
HAVE WILL BE ONE WHO IS OF THE SAME CHARACTER AND HAS THE SAME
LIKES AND DISLIKES AND IS AT THE SAME TIME WILLING TO BE SUBJECT AND
SUBSERVIENT TO HIM HE IS THE MAN WHO WILL HAVE POWER IN THE STATE AND
NO ONE WILL INJURE HIM WITH IMPUNITY IS NOT THAT SO
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND IF A YOUNG MAN BEGINS TO ASK HOW HE MAY BECOME GREAT AND
FORMIDABLE THIS WOULD SEEM TO BE THE WAY HE WILL ACCUSTOM HIMSELF
FROM HIS YOUTH UPWARD TO FEEL SORROW AND JOY ON THE SAME OCCASIONS AS
HIS MASTER AND WILL CONTRIVE TO BE AS LIKE HIM AS POSSIBLE
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND IN THIS WAY HE WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED AS YOU AND YOUR
FRIENDS WOULD SAY THE END OF BECOMING A GREAT MAN AND NOT SUFFERING
INJURY
CALLICLES VERY TRUE
SOCRATES BUT WILL HE ALSO ESCAPE FROM DOING INJURY MUST NOT THE VERY
OPPOSITE BE TRUE IF HE IS TO BE LIKE THE TYRANT IN HIS INJUSTICE AND
TO HAVE INFLUENCE WITH HIM WILL HE NOT RATHER CONTRIVE TO DO AS MUCH
WRONG AS POSSIBLE AND NOT BE PUNISHED
CALLICLES TRUE
SOCRATES AND BY THE IMITATION OF HIS MASTER AND BY THE POWER WHICH HE
THUS ACQUIRES WILL NOT HIS SOUL BECOME BAD AND CORRUPTED AND WILL NOT
THIS BE THE GREATEST EVIL TO HIM
CALLICLES YOU ALWAYS CONTRIVE SOMEHOW OR OTHER SOCRATES TO INVERT
EVERYTHING DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT HE WHO IMITATES THE TYRANT WILL IF HE
HAS A MIND KILL HIM WHO DOES NOT IMITATE HIM AND TAKE AWAY HIS GOODS
SOCRATES EXCELLENT CALLICLES I AM NOT DEAF AND I HAVE HEARD THAT A
GREAT MANY TIMES FROM YOU AND FROM POLUS AND FROM NEARLY EVERY MAN IN
THE CITY BUT I WISH THAT YOU WOULD HEAR ME TOO
I DARE SAY THAT HE WILL
KILL HIM IF HE HAS A MIND THE BAD MAN WILL KILL THE GOOD AND TRUE
CALLICLES AND IS NOT THAT JUST THE PROVOKING THING
SOCRATES NAY NOT TO A MAN OF SENSE AS THE ARGUMENT SHOWS DO YOU
THINK THAT ALL OUR CARES SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO PROLONGING LIFE TO THE
UTTERMOST AND TO THE STUDY OF THOSE ARTS WHICH SECURE US FROM DANGER
ALWAYS LIKE THAT ART OF RHETORIC WHICH SAVES MEN IN COURTS OF LAW AND
WHICH YOU ADVISE ME TO CULTIVATE
CALLICLES YES TRULY AND VERY GOOD ADVICE TOO
SOCRATES WELL MY FRIEND BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SWIMMING IS THAT AN
ART OF ANY GREAT PRETENSIONS
CALLICLES NO INDEED
SOCRATES AND YET SURELY SWIMMING SAVES A MAN FROM DEATH AND THERE
ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH HE MUST KNOW HOW TO SWIM
AND IF YOU DESPISE THE
SWIMMERS I WILL TELL YOU OF ANOTHER AND GREATER ART THE ART OF THE
PILOT WHO NOT ONLY SAVES THE SOULS OF MEN BUT ALSO THEIR BODIES AND
PROPERTIES FROM THE EXTREMITY OF DANGER JUST LIKE RHETORIC
YET HIS ART
IS MODEST AND UNPRESUMING IT HAS NO AIRS OR PRETENCES OF DOING ANYTHING
EXTRAORDINARY AND IN RETURN FOR THE SAME SALVATION WHICH IS GIVEN
BY THE PLEADER DEMANDS ONLY TWO OBOLS IF HE BRINGS US FROM AEGINA TO
ATHENS OR FOR THE LONGER VOYAGE FROM PONTUS OR EGYPT AT THE UTMOST TWO
DRACHMAE WHEN HE HAS SAVED AS I WAS JUST NOW SAYING THE PASSENGER
AND HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND GOODS AND SAFELY DISEMBARKED THEM AT THE
PIRAEUS THIS IS THE PAYMENT WHICH HE ASKS IN RETURN FOR SO GREAT A
BOON AND HE WHO IS THE MASTER OF THE ART AND HAS DONE ALL THIS GETS
OUT AND WALKS ABOUT ON THE SEA SHORE BY HIS SHIP IN AN UNASSUMING WAY
FOR HE IS ABLE TO REFLECT AND IS AWARE THAT HE CANNOT TELL WHICH OF HIS
FELLOW PASSENGERS HE HAS BENEFITED AND WHICH OF THEM HE HAS INJURED IN
NOT ALLOWING THEM TO BE DROWNED
HE KNOWS THAT THEY ARE JUST THE SAME
WHEN HE HAS DISEMBARKED THEM AS WHEN THEY EMBARKED AND NOT A WHIT
BETTER EITHER IN THEIR BODIES OR IN THEIR SOULS AND HE CONSIDERS THAT
IF A MAN WHO IS AFFLICTED BY GREAT AND INCURABLE BODILY DISEASES IS ONLY
TO BE PITIED FOR HAVING ESCAPED AND IS IN NO WAY BENEFITED BY HIM
IN HAVING BEEN SAVED FROM DROWNING MUCH LESS HE WHO HAS GREAT AND
INCURABLE DISEASES NOT OF THE BODY BUT OF THE SOUL WHICH IS THE MORE
VALUABLE PART OF HIM NEITHER IS LIFE WORTH HAVING NOR OF ANY PROFIT TO
THE BAD MAN WHETHER HE BE DELIVERED FROM THE SEA OR THE LAW COURTS OR
ANY OTHER DEVOURER AND SO HE REFLECTS THAT SUCH A ONE HAD BETTER NOT
LIVE FOR HE CANNOT LIVE WELL
COMPARE REPUBLIC
AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE PILOT ALTHOUGH HE IS OUR SAVIOUR IS NOT
USUALLY CONCEITED ANY MORE THAN THE ENGINEER WHO IS NOT AT ALL BEHIND
EITHER THE GENERAL OR THE PILOT OR ANY ONE ELSE IN HIS SAVING POWER
FOR HE SOMETIMES SAVES WHOLE CITIES
IS THERE ANY COMPARISON BETWEEN HIM
AND THE PLEADER AND IF HE WERE TO TALK CALLICLES IN YOUR GRANDIOSE
STYLE HE WOULD BURY YOU UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF WORDS DECLARING AND
INSISTING THAT WE OUGHT ALL OF US TO BE ENGINE MAKERS AND THAT NO
OTHER PROFESSION IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT HE WOULD HAVE PLENTY TO SAY
NEVERTHELESS YOU DESPISE HIM AND HIS ART AND SNEERINGLY CALL HIM AN
ENGINE MAKER AND YOU WILL NOT ALLOW YOUR DAUGHTERS TO MARRY HIS SON
OR MARRY YOUR SON TO HIS DAUGHTERS
AND YET ON YOUR PRINCIPLE WHAT
JUSTICE OR REASON IS THERE IN YOUR REFUSAL WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO
DESPISE THE ENGINE MAKER AND THE OTHERS WHOM I WAS JUST NOW MENTIONING
I KNOW THAT YOU WILL SAY 'I AM BETTER AND BETTER BORN BUT IF THE
BETTER IS NOT WHAT I SAY AND VIRTUE CONSISTS ONLY IN A MAN SAVING
HIMSELF AND HIS WHATEVER MAY BE HIS CHARACTER THEN YOUR CENSURE OF THE
ENGINE MAKER AND OF THE PHYSICIAN AND OF THE OTHER ARTS OF SALVATION
IS RIDICULOUS
O MY FRIEND I WANT YOU TO SEE THAT THE NOBLE AND
THE GOOD MAY POSSIBLY BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM SAVING AND BEING
SAVED MAY NOT HE WHO IS TRULY A MAN CEASE TO CARE ABOUT LIVING A
CERTAIN TIME HE KNOWS AS WOMEN SAY THAT NO MAN CAN ESCAPE FATE
AND THEREFORE HE IS NOT FOND OF LIFE HE LEAVES ALL THAT WITH GOD AND
CONSIDERS IN WHAT WAY HE CAN BEST SPEND HIS APPOINTED TERM WHETHER BY
ASSIMILATING HIMSELF TO THE CONSTITUTION UNDER WHICH HE LIVES AS YOU AT
THIS MOMENT HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW YOU MAY BECOME AS LIKE AS POSSIBLE TO
THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE IF YOU MEAN TO BE IN THEIR GOOD GRACES AND TO HAVE
POWER IN THE STATE WHEREAS I WANT YOU TO THINK AND SEE WHETHER THIS IS
FOR THE INTEREST OF EITHER OF US I WOULD NOT HAVE US RISK THAT
WHICH IS DEAREST ON THE ACQUISITION OF THIS POWER LIKE THE THESSALIAN
ENCHANTRESSES WHO AS THEY SAY BRING DOWN THE MOON FROM HEAVEN AT THE
RISK OF THEIR OWN PERDITION
BUT IF YOU SUPPOSE THAT ANY MAN WILL
SHOW YOU THE ART OF BECOMING GREAT IN THE CITY AND YET NOT CONFORMING
YOURSELF TO THE WAYS OF THE CITY WHETHER FOR BETTER OR WORSE THEN I
CAN ONLY SAY THAT YOU ARE MISTAKEN CALLIDES FOR HE WHO WOULD DESERVE
TO BE THE TRUE NATURAL FRIEND OF THE ATHENIAN DEMUS AYE OR OF
PYRILAMPES' DARLING WHO IS CALLED AFTER THEM MUST BE BY NATURE LIKE
THEM AND NOT AN IMITATOR ONLY
HE THEN WHO WILL MAKE YOU MOST LIKE
THEM WILL MAKE YOU AS YOU DESIRE A STATESMAN AND ORATOR FOR EVERY
MAN IS PLEASED WHEN HE IS SPOKEN TO IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE AND SPIRIT AND
DISLIKES ANY OTHER
BUT PERHAPS YOU SWEET CALLICLES MAY BE OF ANOTHER
MIND
WHAT DO YOU SAY
CALLICLES SOMEHOW OR OTHER YOUR WORDS SOCRATES ALWAYS APPEAR TO ME
TO BE GOOD WORDS AND YET LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD I AM NOT QUITE
CONVINCED BY THEM
COMPARE SYMP 1 ALCIB
SOCRATES THE REASON IS CALLICLES THAT THE LOVE OF DEMUS WHICH ABIDES
IN YOUR SOUL IS AN ADVERSARY TO ME BUT I DARE SAY THAT IF WE RECUR
TO THESE SAME MATTERS AND CONSIDER THEM MORE THOROUGHLY YOU MAY BE
CONVINCED FOR ALL THAT
PLEASE THEN TO REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE TWO
PROCESSES OF TRAINING ALL THINGS INCLUDING BODY AND SOUL IN THE ONE
AS WE SAID WE TREAT THEM WITH A VIEW TO PLEASURE AND IN THE OTHER WITH
A VIEW TO THE HIGHEST GOOD AND THEN WE DO NOT INDULGE BUT RESIST THEM
WAS NOT THAT THE DISTINCTION WHICH WE DREW
CALLICLES VERY TRUE
SOCRATES AND THE ONE WHICH HAD PLEASURE IN VIEW WAS JUST A VULGAR
FLATTERY WAS NOT THAT ANOTHER OF OUR CONCLUSIONS
CALLICLES BE IT SO IF YOU WILL HAVE IT
SOCRATES AND THE OTHER HAD IN VIEW THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT OF THAT
WHICH WAS MINISTERED TO WHETHER BODY OR SOUL
CALLICLES QUITE TRUE
SOCRATES AND MUST WE NOT HAVE THE SAME END IN VIEW IN THE TREATMENT
OF OUR CITY AND CITIZENS MUST WE NOT TRY AND MAKE THEM AS GOOD AS
POSSIBLE FOR WE HAVE ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS NO USE IN
IMPARTING TO THEM ANY OTHER GOOD UNLESS THE MIND OF THOSE WHO ARE TO
HAVE THE GOOD WHETHER MONEY OR OFFICE OR ANY OTHER SORT OF POWER BE
GENTLE AND GOOD
SHALL WE SAY THAT
CALLICLES YES CERTAINLY IF YOU LIKE
SOCRATES WELL THEN IF YOU AND I CALLICLES WERE INTENDING TO SET
ABOUT SOME PUBLIC BUSINESS AND WERE ADVISING ONE ANOTHER TO UNDERTAKE
BUILDINGS SUCH AS WALLS DOCKS OR TEMPLES OF THE LARGEST SIZE OUGHT
WE NOT TO EXAMINE OURSELVES FIRST AS TO WHETHER WE KNOW OR DO NOT KNOW
THE ART OF BUILDING AND WHO TAUGHT US WOULD NOT THAT BE NECESSARY
CALLICLES
CALLICLES TRUE
SOCRATES IN THE SECOND PLACE WE SHOULD HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER WE
HAD EVER CONSTRUCTED ANY PRIVATE HOUSE EITHER OF OUR OWN OR FOR OUR
FRIENDS AND WHETHER THIS BUILDING OF OURS WAS A SUCCESS OR NOT AND IF
UPON CONSIDERATION WE FOUND THAT WE HAD HAD GOOD AND EMINENT MASTERS
AND HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CONSTRUCTING MANY FINE BUILDINGS NOT ONLY
WITH THEIR ASSISTANCE BUT WITHOUT THEM BY OUR OWN UNAIDED SKILL IN
THAT CASE PRUDENCE WOULD NOT DISSUADE US FROM PROCEEDING TO THE
CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC WORKS
BUT IF WE HAD NO MASTER TO SHOW AND ONLY
A NUMBER OF WORTHLESS BUILDINGS OR NONE AT ALL THEN SURELY IT WOULD
BE RIDICULOUS IN US TO ATTEMPT PUBLIC WORKS OR TO ADVISE ONE ANOTHER TO
UNDERTAKE THEM
IS NOT THIS TRUE
CALLICLES CERTAINLY
SOCRATES AND DOES NOT THE SAME HOLD IN ALL OTHER CASES IF YOU AND I
WERE PHYSICIANS AND WERE ADVISING ONE ANOTHER THAT WE WERE COMPETENT TO
PRACTISE AS STATE PHYSICIANS SHOULD I NOT ASK ABOUT YOU AND WOULD
YOU NOT ASK ABOUT ME WELL BUT HOW ABOUT SOCRATES HIMSELF HAS HE GOOD
HEALTH AND WAS ANY ONE ELSE EVER KNOWN TO BE CURED BY HIM WHETHER
SLAVE OR FREEMAN AND I SHOULD MAKE THE SAME ENQUIRIES ABOUT YOU
AND IF
WE ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT NO ONE WHETHER CITIZEN OR STRANGER
MAN OR WOMAN HAD EVER BEEN ANY THE BETTER FOR THE MEDICAL SKILL OF
EITHER OF US THEN BY HEAVEN CALLICLES WHAT AN ABSURDITY TO
THINK THAT WE OR ANY HUMAN BEING SHOULD BE SO SILLY AS TO SET UP AS
STATE PHYSICIANS AND ADVISE OTHERS LIKE OURSELVES TO DO THE SAME
WITHOUT HAVING FIRST PRACTISED IN PRIVATE WHETHER SUCCESSFULLY OR NOT
AND ACQUIRED EXPERIENCE OF THE ART IS NOT THIS AS THEY SAY TO BEGIN
WITH THE BIG JAR WHEN YOU ARE LEARNING THE POTTER'S ART WHICH IS A
FOOLISH THING
CALLICLES TRUE
SOCRATES AND NOW MY FRIEND AS YOU ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO BE A
PUBLIC CHARACTER AND ARE ADMONISHING AND REPROACHING ME FOR NOT BEING
ONE SUPPOSE THAT WE ASK A FEW QUESTIONS OF ONE ANOTHER
TELL ME THEN
CALLICLES HOW ABOUT MAKING ANY OF THE CITIZENS BETTER WAS THERE EVER
A MAN WHO WAS ONCE VICIOUS OR UNJUST OR INTEMPERATE OR FOOLISH AND
BECAME BY THE HELP OF CALLICLES GOOD AND NOBLE WAS THERE EVER SUCH A
MAN WHETHER CITIZEN OR STRANGER SLAVE OR FREEMAN TELL ME CALLICLES
IF A PERSON WERE TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS OF YOU WHAT WOULD YOU ANSWER
WHOM WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU HAD IMPROVED BY YOUR CONVERSATION THERE MAY
HAVE BEEN GOOD DEEDS OF THIS SORT WHICH WERE DONE BY YOU AS A PRIVATE
PERSON BEFORE YOU CAME FORWARD IN PUBLIC
WHY WILL YOU NOT ANSWER
CALLICLES YOU ARE CONTENTIOUS SOCRATES
SOCRATES NAY I ASK YOU NOT FROM A LOVE OF CONTENTION BUT BECAUSE
I REALLY WANT TO KNOW IN WHAT WAY YOU THINK THAT AFFAIRS SHOULD BE
ADMINISTERED AMONG US WHETHER WHEN YOU COME TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF
THEM YOU HAVE ANY OTHER AIM BUT THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CITIZENS HAVE
WE NOT ALREADY ADMITTED MANY TIMES OVER THAT SUCH IS THE DUTY OF A
PUBLIC MAN NAY WE HAVE SURELY SAID SO FOR IF YOU WILL NOT ANSWER FOR
YOURSELF I MUST ANSWER FOR YOU
BUT IF THIS IS WHAT THE GOOD MAN OUGHT
TO EFFECT FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS OWN STATE ALLOW ME TO RECALL TO YOU
THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOM YOU WERE JUST NOW MENTIONING PERICLES AND
CIMON AND MILTIADES AND THEMISTOCLES AND ASK WHETHER YOU STILL THINK
THAT THEY WERE GOOD CITIZENS
CALLICLES I DO
SOCRATES BUT IF THEY WERE GOOD THEN CLEARLY EACH OF THEM MUST HAVE
MADE THE CITIZENS BETTER INSTEAD OF WORSE
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND THEREFORE WHEN PERICLES FIRST BEGAN TO SPEAK IN THE
ASSEMBLY THE ATHENIANS WERE NOT SO GOOD AS WHEN HE SPOKE LAST
CALLICLES VERY LIKELY
SOCRATES NAY MY FRIEND 'LIKELY' IS NOT THE WORD FOR IF HE WAS A GOOD
CITIZEN THE INFERENCE IS CERTAIN
CALLICLES AND WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE
SOCRATES NONE ONLY I SHOULD LIKE FURTHER TO KNOW WHETHER THE ATHENIANS
ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN MADE BETTER BY PERICLES OR ON THE CONTRARY
TO HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED BY HIM FOR I HEAR THAT HE WAS THE FIRST WHO GAVE
THE PEOPLE PAY AND MADE THEM IDLE AND COWARDLY AND ENCOURAGED THEM IN
THE LOVE OF TALK AND MONEY
CALLICLES YOU HEARD THAT SOCRATES FROM THE LACONISING SET WHO BRUISE
THEIR EARS
SOCRATES BUT WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU NOW IS NOT MERE HEARSAY BUT
WELL KNOWN BOTH TO YOU AND ME THAT AT FIRST PERICLES WAS GLORIOUS
AND HIS CHARACTER UNIMPEACHED BY ANY VERDICT OF THE ATHENIANS THIS WAS
DURING THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE NOT SO GOOD YET AFTERWARDS WHEN THEY
HAD BEEN MADE GOOD AND GENTLE BY HIM AT THE VERY END OF HIS LIFE THEY
CONVICTED HIM OF THEFT AND ALMOST PUT HIM TO DEATH CLEARLY UNDER THE
NOTION THAT HE WAS A MALEFACTOR
CALLICLES WELL BUT HOW DOES THAT PROVE PERICLES' BADNESS
SOCRATES WHY SURELY YOU WOULD SAY THAT HE WAS A BAD MANAGER OF ASSES
OR HORSES OR OXEN WHO HAD RECEIVED THEM ORIGINALLY NEITHER KICKING NOR
BUTTING NOR BITING HIM AND IMPLANTED IN THEM ALL THESE SAVAGE TRICKS
WOULD HE NOT BE A BAD MANAGER OF ANY ANIMALS WHO RECEIVED THEM GENTLE
AND MADE THEM FIERCER THAN THEY WERE WHEN HE RECEIVED THEM WHAT DO YOU
SAY
CALLICLES I WILL DO YOU THE FAVOUR OF SAYING 'YES
SOCRATES AND WILL YOU ALSO DO ME THE FAVOUR OF SAYING WHETHER MAN IS AN
ANIMAL
CALLICLES CERTAINLY HE IS
SOCRATES AND WAS NOT PERICLES A SHEPHERD OF MEN
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES AND IF HE WAS A GOOD POLITICAL SHEPHERD OUGHT NOT THE ANIMALS
WHO WERE HIS SUBJECTS AS WE WERE JUST NOW ACKNOWLEDGING TO HAVE BECOME
MORE JUST AND NOT MORE UNJUST
CALLICLES QUITE TRUE
SOCRATES AND ARE NOT JUST MEN GENTLE AS HOMER SAYS OR ARE YOU OF
ANOTHER MIND
CALLICLES I AGREE
SOCRATES AND YET HE REALLY DID MAKE THEM MORE SAVAGE THAN HE RECEIVED
THEM AND THEIR SAVAGENESS WAS SHOWN TOWARDS HIMSELF WHICH HE MUST HAVE
BEEN VERY FAR FROM DESIRING
CALLICLES DO YOU WANT ME TO AGREE WITH YOU
SOCRATES YES IF I SEEM TO YOU TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
CALLICLES GRANTED THEN
SOCRATES AND IF THEY WERE MORE SAVAGE MUST THEY NOT HAVE BEEN MORE
UNJUST AND INFERIOR
CALLICLES GRANTED AGAIN
SOCRATES THEN UPON THIS VIEW PERICLES WAS NOT A GOOD STATESMAN
CALLICLES THAT IS UPON YOUR VIEW
SOCRATES NAY THE VIEW IS YOURS AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE ADMITTED
TAKE
THE CASE OF CIMON AGAIN
DID NOT THE VERY PERSONS WHOM HE WAS SERVING
OSTRACIZE HIM IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HEAR HIS VOICE FOR TEN
YEARS AND THEY DID JUST THE SAME TO THEMISTOCLES ADDING THE PENALTY
OF EXILE AND THEY VOTED THAT MILTIADES THE HERO OF MARATHON SHOULD BE
THROWN INTO THE PIT OF DEATH AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY THE PRYTANIS
AND
YET IF THEY HAD BEEN REALLY GOOD MEN AS YOU SAY THESE THINGS WOULD
NEVER HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM
FOR THE GOOD CHARIOTEERS ARE NOT THOSE
WHO AT FIRST KEEP THEIR PLACE AND THEN WHEN THEY HAVE BROKEN IN THEIR
HORSES AND THEMSELVES BECOME BETTER CHARIOTEERS ARE THROWN OUT THAT
IS NOT THE WAY EITHER IN CHARIOTEERING OR IN ANY PROFESSION WHAT DO
YOU THINK
CALLICLES I SHOULD THINK NOT
SOCRATES WELL BUT IF SO THE TRUTH IS AS I HAVE SAID ALREADY THAT
IN THE ATHENIAN STATE NO ONE HAS EVER SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE A GOOD
STATESMAN YOU ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS TRUE OF OUR PRESENT STATESMEN BUT
NOT TRUE OF FORMER ONES AND YOU PREFERRED THEM TO THE OTHERS YET THEY
HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE NO BETTER THAN OUR PRESENT ONES AND THEREFORE IF
THEY WERE RHETORICIANS THEY DID NOT USE THE TRUE ART OF RHETORIC OR OF
FLATTERY OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE FALLEN OUT OF FAVOUR
CALLICLES BUT SURELY SOCRATES NO LIVING MAN EVER CAME NEAR ANY ONE OF
THEM IN HIS PERFORMANCES
SOCRATES O MY DEAR FRIEND I SAY NOTHING AGAINST THEM REGARDED AS THE
SERVING MEN OF THE STATE AND I DO THINK THAT THEY WERE CERTAINLY MORE
SERVICEABLE THAN THOSE WHO ARE LIVING NOW AND BETTER ABLE TO GRATIFY
THE WISHES OF THE STATE BUT AS TO TRANSFORMING THOSE DESIRES AND NOT
ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE THEIR WAY AND USING THE POWERS WHICH THEY HAD
WHETHER OF PERSUASION OR OF FORCE IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR FELLOW
CITIZENS WHICH IS THE PRIME OBJECT OF THE TRULY GOOD CITIZEN I DO
NOT SEE THAT IN THESE RESPECTS THEY WERE A WHIT SUPERIOR TO OUR PRESENT
STATESMEN ALTHOUGH I DO ADMIT THAT THEY WERE MORE CLEVER AT PROVIDING
SHIPS AND WALLS AND DOCKS AND ALL THAT
YOU AND I HAVE A RIDICULOUS
WAY FOR DURING THE WHOLE TIME THAT WE ARE ARGUING WE ARE ALWAYS GOING
ROUND AND ROUND TO THE SAME POINT AND CONSTANTLY MISUNDERSTANDING ONE
ANOTHER
IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN YOU HAVE ADMITTED AND ACKNOWLEDGED MORE
THAN ONCE THAT THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF OPERATIONS WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH
THE BODY AND TWO WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH THE SOUL ONE OF THE TWO IS
MINISTERIAL AND IF OUR BODIES ARE HUNGRY PROVIDES FOOD FOR THEM AND
IF THEY ARE THIRSTY GIVES THEM DRINK OR IF THEY ARE COLD SUPPLIES THEM
WITH GARMENTS BLANKETS SHOES AND ALL THAT THEY CRAVE
I USE THE SAME
IMAGES AS BEFORE INTENTIONALLY IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY UNDERSTAND ME THE
BETTER
THE PURVEYOR OF THE ARTICLES MAY PROVIDE THEM EITHER WHOLESALE
OR RETAIL OR HE MAY BE THE MAKER OF ANY OF THEM THE BAKER OR THE
COOK OR THE WEAVER OR THE SHOEMAKER OR THE CURRIER AND IN SO DOING
BEING SUCH AS HE IS HE IS NATURALLY SUPPOSED BY HIMSELF AND EVERY ONE
TO MINISTER TO THE BODY
FOR NONE OF THEM KNOW THAT THERE IS ANOTHER
ART AN ART OF GYMNASTIC AND MEDICINE WHICH IS THE TRUE MINISTER OF THE
BODY AND OUGHT TO BE THE MISTRESS OF ALL THE REST AND TO USE THEIR
RESULTS ACCORDING TO THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH SHE HAS AND THEY HAVE NOT OF
THE REAL GOOD OR BAD EFFECTS OF MEATS AND DRINKS ON THE BODY
ALL
OTHER ARTS WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH THE BODY ARE SERVILE AND MENIAL AND
ILLIBERAL AND GYMNASTIC AND MEDICINE ARE AS THEY OUGHT TO BE THEIR
MISTRESSES
NOW WHEN I SAY THAT ALL THIS IS EQUALLY TRUE OF THE SOUL
YOU SEEM AT FIRST TO KNOW AND UNDERSTAND AND ASSENT TO MY WORDS AND
THEN A LITTLE WHILE AFTERWARDS YOU COME REPEATING HAS NOT THE STATE
HAD GOOD AND NOBLE CITIZENS AND WHEN I ASK YOU WHO THEY ARE YOU REPLY
SEEMINGLY QUITE IN EARNEST AS IF I HAD ASKED WHO ARE OR HAVE BEEN
GOOD TRAINERS AND YOU HAD REPLIED THEARION THE BAKER MITHOECUS
WHO WROTE THE SICILIAN COOKERY BOOK SARAMBUS THE VINTNER THESE ARE
MINISTERS OF THE BODY FIRST RATE IN THEIR ART FOR THE FIRST MAKES
ADMIRABLE LOAVES THE SECOND EXCELLENT DISHES AND THE THIRD CAPITAL
WINE TO ME THESE APPEAR TO BE THE EXACT PARALLEL OF THE STATESMEN WHOM
YOU MENTION
NOW YOU WOULD NOT BE ALTOGETHER PLEASED IF I SAID TO
YOU MY FRIEND YOU KNOW NOTHING OF GYMNASTICS THOSE OF WHOM YOU ARE
SPEAKING TO ME ARE ONLY THE MINISTERS AND PURVEYORS OF LUXURY WHO HAVE
NO GOOD OR NOBLE NOTIONS OF THEIR ART AND MAY VERY LIKELY BE FILLING
AND FATTENING MEN'S BODIES AND GAINING THEIR APPROVAL ALTHOUGH THE
RESULT IS THAT THEY LOSE THEIR ORIGINAL FLESH IN THE LONG RUN AND
BECOME THINNER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE AND YET THEY IN THEIR
SIMPLICITY WILL NOT ATTRIBUTE THEIR DISEASES AND LOSS OF FLESH TO THEIR
ENTERTAINERS BUT WHEN IN AFTER YEARS THE UNHEALTHY SURFEIT BRINGS THE
ATTENDANT PENALTY OF DISEASE HE WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEAR THEM AT THE
TIME AND OFFERS THEM ADVICE IS ACCUSED AND BLAMED BY THEM AND IF THEY
COULD THEY WOULD DO HIM SOME HARM WHILE THEY PROCEED TO EULOGIZE THE
MEN WHO HAVE BEEN THE REAL AUTHORS OF THE MISCHIEF
AND THAT CALLICLES
IS JUST WHAT YOU ARE NOW DOING
YOU PRAISE THE MEN WHO FEASTED THE
CITIZENS AND SATISFIED THEIR DESIRES AND PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY HAVE MADE
THE CITY GREAT NOT SEEING THAT THE SWOLLEN AND ULCERATED CONDITION OF
THE STATE IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO THESE ELDER STATESMEN FOR THEY HAVE
FILLED THE CITY FULL OF HARBOURS AND DOCKS AND WALLS AND REVENUES AND
ALL THAT AND HAVE LEFT NO ROOM FOR JUSTICE AND TEMPERANCE
AND WHEN THE
CRISIS OF THE DISORDER COMES THE PEOPLE WILL BLAME THE ADVISERS OF THE
HOUR AND APPLAUD THEMISTOCLES AND CIMON AND PERICLES WHO ARE THE REAL
AUTHORS OF THEIR CALAMITIES AND IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL THEY MAY ASSAIL
YOU AND MY FRIEND ALCIBIADES WHEN THEY ARE LOSING NOT ONLY THEIR NEW
ACQUISITIONS BUT ALSO THEIR ORIGINAL POSSESSIONS NOT THAT YOU ARE
THE AUTHORS OF THESE MISFORTUNES OF THEIRS ALTHOUGH YOU MAY PERHAPS BE
ACCESSORIES TO THEM
A GREAT PIECE OF WORK IS ALWAYS BEING MADE AS
I SEE AND AM TOLD NOW AS OF OLD ABOUT OUR STATESMEN
WHEN THE STATE
TREATS ANY OF THEM AS MALEFACTORS I OBSERVE THAT THERE IS A GREAT
UPROAR AND INDIGNATION AT THE SUPPOSED WRONG WHICH IS DONE TO THEM
'AFTER ALL THEIR MANY SERVICES TO THE STATE THAT THEY SHOULD UNJUSTLY
PERISH SO THE TALE RUNS
BUT THE CRY IS ALL A LIE FOR NO STATESMAN
EVER COULD BE UNJUSTLY PUT TO DEATH BY THE CITY OF WHICH HE IS THE HEAD
THE CASE OF THE PROFESSED STATESMAN IS I BELIEVE VERY MUCH LIKE THAT
OF THE PROFESSED SOPHIST FOR THE SOPHISTS ALTHOUGH THEY ARE WISE MEN
ARE NEVERTHELESS GUILTY OF A STRANGE PIECE OF FOLLY PROFESSING TO BE
TEACHERS OF VIRTUE THEY WILL OFTEN ACCUSE THEIR DISCIPLES OF WRONGING
THEM AND DEFRAUDING THEM OF THEIR PAY AND SHOWING NO GRATITUDE FOR
THEIR SERVICES
YET WHAT CAN BE MORE ABSURD THAN THAT MEN WHO HAVE
BECOME JUST AND GOOD AND WHOSE INJUSTICE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM
AND WHO HAVE HAD JUSTICE IMPLANTED IN THEM BY THEIR TEACHERS SHOULD ACT
UNJUSTLY BY REASON OF THE INJUSTICE WHICH IS NOT IN THEM CAN ANYTHING
BE MORE IRRATIONAL MY FRIENDS THAN THIS YOU CALLICLES COMPEL ME TO
BE A MOB ORATOR BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT ANSWER
CALLICLES AND YOU ARE THE MAN WHO CANNOT SPEAK UNLESS THERE IS SOME ONE
TO ANSWER
SOCRATES I SUPPOSE THAT I CAN JUST NOW AT ANY RATE THE SPEECHES
WHICH I AM MAKING ARE LONG ENOUGH BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO ANSWER ME
BUT
I ADJURE YOU BY THE GOD OF FRIENDSHIP MY GOOD SIR DO TELL ME WHETHER
THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO YOU TO BE A GREAT INCONSISTENCY IN SAYING THAT
YOU HAVE MADE A MAN GOOD AND THEN BLAMING HIM FOR BEING BAD
CALLICLES YES IT APPEARS SO TO ME
SOCRATES DO YOU NEVER HEAR OUR PROFESSORS OF EDUCATION SPEAKING IN THIS
INCONSISTENT MANNER
CALLICLES YES BUT WHY TALK OF MEN WHO ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING
SOCRATES I WOULD RATHER SAY WHY TALK OF MEN WHO PROFESS TO BE RULERS
AND DECLARE THAT THEY ARE DEVOTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CITY AND
NEVERTHELESS UPON OCCASION DECLAIM AGAINST THE UTTER VILENESS OF THE
CITY DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND THE
OTHER MY GOOD FRIEND THE SOPHIST AND THE RHETORICIAN AS I WAS SAYING
TO POLUS ARE THE SAME OR NEARLY THE SAME BUT YOU IGNORANTLY FANCY
THAT RHETORIC IS A PERFECT THING AND SOPHISTRY A THING TO BE DESPISED
WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS THAT SOPHISTRY IS AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO RHETORIC
AS LEGISLATION IS TO THE PRACTICE OF LAW OR GYMNASTIC TO MEDICINE
THE
ORATORS AND SOPHISTS AS I AM INCLINED TO THINK ARE THE ONLY CLASS WHO
CANNOT COMPLAIN OF THE MISCHIEF ENSUING TO THEMSELVES FROM THAT WHICH
THEY TEACH OTHERS WITHOUT IN THE SAME BREATH ACCUSING THEMSELVES OF
HAVING DONE NO GOOD TO THOSE WHOM THEY PROFESS TO BENEFIT
IS NOT THIS A
FACT
CALLICLES CERTAINLY IT IS
SOCRATES IF THEY WERE RIGHT IN SAYING THAT THEY MAKE MEN BETTER THEN
THEY ARE THE ONLY CLASS WHO CAN AFFORD TO LEAVE THEIR REMUNERATION
TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BENEFITED BY THEM
WHEREAS IF A MAN HAS BEEN
BENEFITED IN ANY OTHER WAY IF FOR EXAMPLE HE HAS BEEN TAUGHT TO RUN
BY A TRAINER HE MIGHT POSSIBLY DEFRAUD HIM OF HIS PAY IF THE TRAINER
LEFT THE MATTER TO HIM AND MADE NO AGREEMENT WITH HIM THAT HE SHOULD
RECEIVE MONEY AS SOON AS HE HAD GIVEN HIM THE UTMOST SPEED FOR NOT
BECAUSE OF ANY DEFICIENCY OF SPEED DO MEN ACT UNJUSTLY BUT BY REASON OF
INJUSTICE
CALLICLES VERY TRUE
SOCRATES AND HE WHO REMOVES INJUSTICE CAN BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING
TREATED UNJUSTLY HE ALONE CAN SAFELY LEAVE THE HONORARIUM TO HIS
PUPILS IF HE BE REALLY ABLE TO MAKE THEM GOOD AM I NOT RIGHT COMPARE
PROTAG
CALLICLES YES
SOCRATES THEN WE HAVE FOUND THE REASON WHY THERE IS NO DISHONOUR IN A
MAN RECEIVING PAY WHO IS CALLED IN TO ADVISE ABOUT BUILDING OR ANY OTHER
ART
CALLICLES YES WE HAVE FOUND THE REASON
SOCRATES BUT WHEN THE POINT IS HOW A MAN MAY BECOME BEST HIMSELF
AND BEST GOVERN HIS FAMILY AND STATE THEN TO SAY THAT YOU WILL GIVE NO
ADVICE GRATIS IS HELD TO BE DISHONOURABLE
CALLICLES TRUE
SOCRATES AND WHY BECAUSE ONLY SUCH BENEFITS CALL FORTH A DESIRE TO
REQUITE THEM AND THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT A BENEFIT HAS BEEN CONFERRED
WHEN THE BENEFACTOR RECEIVES A RETURN OTHERWISE NOT
IS THIS TRUE
CALLICLES IT IS
SOCRATES THEN TO WHICH SERVICE OF THE STATE DO YOU INVITE ME DETERMINE
FOR ME
AM I TO BE THE PHYSICIAN OF THE STATE WHO WILL STRIVE AND
STRUGGLE TO MAKE THE ATHENIANS AS GOOD AS POSSIBLE OR AM I TO BE THE
SERVANT AND FLATTERER OF THE STATE SPEAK OUT MY GOOD FRIEND FREELY
AND FAIRLY AS YOU DID AT FIRST AND OUGHT TO DO AGAIN AND TELL ME YOUR
ENTIRE MIND
CALLICLES I SAY THEN THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE SERVANT OF THE STATE
SOCRATES THE FLATTERER WELL SIR THAT IS A NOBLE INVITATION
CALLICLES THE MYSIAN SOCRATES OR WHAT YOU PLEASE
FOR IF YOU REFUSE
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE
SOCRATES DO NOT REPEAT THE OLD STORY THAT HE WHO LIKES WILL KILL ME
AND GET MY MONEY FOR THEN I SHALL HAVE TO REPEAT THE OLD ANSWER THAT
HE WILL BE A BAD MAN AND WILL KILL THE GOOD AND THAT THE MONEY WILL
BE OF NO USE TO HIM BUT THAT HE WILL WRONGLY USE THAT WHICH HE WRONGLY
TOOK AND IF WRONGLY BASELY AND IF BASELY HURTFULLY
CALLICLES HOW CONFIDENT YOU ARE SOCRATES THAT YOU WILL NEVER COME TO
HARM YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT YOU ARE LIVING IN ANOTHER COUNTRY AND
CAN NEVER BE BROUGHT INTO A COURT OF JUSTICE AS YOU VERY LIKELY MAY BE
BROUGHT BY SOME MISERABLE AND MEAN PERSON
SOCRATES THEN I MUST INDEED BE A FOOL CALLICLES IF I DO NOT KNOW THAT
IN THE ATHENIAN STATE ANY MAN MAY SUFFER ANYTHING
AND IF I AM BROUGHT
TO TRIAL AND INCUR THE DANGERS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK HE WILL BE A VILLAIN
WHO BRINGS ME TO TRIAL OF THAT I AM VERY SURE FOR NO GOOD MAN WOULD
ACCUSE THE INNOCENT
NOR SHALL I BE SURPRISED IF I AM PUT TO DEATH
SHALL I TELL YOU WHY I ANTICIPATE THIS
CALLICLES BY ALL MEANS
SOCRATES I THINK THAT I AM THE ONLY OR ALMOST THE ONLY ATHENIAN LIVING
WHO PRACTISES THE TRUE ART OF POLITICS I AM THE ONLY POLITICIAN OF MY
TIME
NOW SEEING THAT WHEN I SPEAK MY WORDS ARE NOT UTTERED WITH ANY
VIEW OF GAINING FAVOUR AND THAT I LOOK TO WHAT IS BEST AND NOT TO WHAT
IS MOST PLEASANT HAVING NO MIND TO USE THOSE ARTS AND GRACES WHICH YOU
RECOMMEND I SHALL HAVE NOTHING TO SAY IN THE JUSTICE COURT
AND YOU
MIGHT ARGUE WITH ME AS I WAS ARGUING WITH POLUS I SHALL BE TRIED
JUST AS A PHYSICIAN WOULD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF LITTLE BOYS AT THE
INDICTMENT OF THE COOK
WHAT WOULD HE REPLY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
IF SOME ONE WERE TO ACCUSE HIM SAYING 'O MY BOYS MANY EVIL THINGS HAS
THIS MAN DONE TO YOU HE IS THE DEATH OF YOU ESPECIALLY OF THE YOUNGER
ONES AMONG YOU CUTTING AND BURNING AND STARVING AND SUFFOCATING YOU
UNTIL YOU KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO HE GIVES YOU THE BITTEREST POTIONS AND
COMPELS YOU TO HUNGER AND THIRST
HOW UNLIKE THE VARIETY OF MEATS AND
SWEETS ON WHICH I FEASTED YOU WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT THE PHYSICIAN
WOULD BE ABLE TO REPLY WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PREDICAMENT IF
HE TOLD THE TRUTH HE COULD ONLY SAY 'ALL THESE EVIL THINGS MY BOYS I
DID FOR YOUR HEALTH AND THEN WOULD THERE NOT JUST BE A CLAMOUR AMONG A
JURY LIKE THAT HOW THEY WOULD CRY OUT
CALLICLES I DARE SAY
SOCRATES WOULD HE NOT BE UTTERLY AT A LOSS FOR A REPLY
CALLICLES HE CERTAINLY WOULD
SOCRATES AND I TOO SHALL BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY AS I WELL KNOW
IF I AM BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT
FOR I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO REHEARSE
TO THE PEOPLE THE PLEASURES WHICH I HAVE PROCURED FOR THEM AND WHICH
ALTHOUGH I AM NOT DISPOSED TO ENVY EITHER THE PROCURERS OR ENJOYERS OF
THEM ARE DEEMED BY THEM TO BE BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES
AND IF ANY ONE
SAYS THAT I CORRUPT YOUNG MEN AND PERPLEX THEIR MINDS OR THAT I SPEAK
EVIL OF OLD MEN AND USE BITTER WORDS TOWARDS THEM WHETHER IN PRIVATE
OR PUBLIC IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO REPLY AS I TRULY MIGHT 'ALL THIS I
DO FOR THE SAKE OF JUSTICE AND WITH A VIEW TO YOUR INTEREST MY JUDGES
AND TO NOTHING ELSE AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO SAYING WHAT MAY HAPPEN
TO ME
CALLICLES AND DO YOU THINK SOCRATES THAT A MAN WHO IS THUS
DEFENCELESS IS IN A GOOD POSITION
SOCRATES YES CALLICLES IF HE HAVE THAT DEFENCE WHICH AS YOU HAVE
OFTEN ACKNOWLEDGED HE SHOULD HAVE IF HE BE HIS OWN DEFENCE AND HAVE
NEVER SAID OR DONE ANYTHING WRONG EITHER IN RESPECT OF GODS OR MEN
AND THIS HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY US TO BE THE BEST SORT OF
DEFENCE
AND IF ANY ONE COULD CONVICT ME OF INABILITY TO DEFEND MYSELF
OR OTHERS AFTER THIS SORT I SHOULD BLUSH FOR SHAME WHETHER I WAS
CONVICTED BEFORE MANY OR BEFORE A FEW OR BY MYSELF ALONE AND IF I
DIED FROM WANT OF ABILITY TO DO SO THAT WOULD INDEED GRIEVE ME
BUT IF
I DIED BECAUSE I HAVE NO POWERS OF FLATTERY OR RHETORIC I AM VERY SURE
THAT YOU WOULD NOT FIND ME REPINING AT DEATH
FOR NO MAN WHO IS NOT AN
UTTER FOOL AND COWARD IS AFRAID OF DEATH ITSELF BUT HE IS AFRAID OF
DOING WRONG
FOR TO GO TO THE WORLD BELOW HAVING ONE'S SOUL FULL OF
INJUSTICE IS THE LAST AND WORST OF ALL EVILS
AND IN PROOF OF WHAT I
SAY IF YOU HAVE NO OBJECTION I SHOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY
CALLICLES VERY WELL PROCEED AND THEN WE SHALL HAVE DONE
SOCRATES LISTEN THEN AS STORY TELLERS SAY TO A VERY PRETTY TALE
WHICH I DARE SAY THAT YOU MAY BE DISPOSED TO REGARD AS A FABLE ONLY
BUT WHICH AS I BELIEVE IS A TRUE TALE FOR I MEAN TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
HOMER TELLS US IL HOW ZEUS AND POSEIDON AND PLUTO DIVIDED THE EMPIRE
WHICH THEY INHERITED FROM THEIR FATHER
NOW IN THE DAYS OF CRONOS THERE
EXISTED A LAW RESPECTING THE DESTINY OF MAN WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND
STILL CONTINUES TO BE IN HEAVEN THAT HE WHO HAS LIVED ALL HIS LIFE IN
JUSTICE AND HOLINESS SHALL GO WHEN HE IS DEAD TO THE ISLANDS OF THE
BLESSED AND DWELL THERE IN PERFECT HAPPINESS OUT OF THE REACH OF EVIL
BUT THAT HE WHO HAS LIVED UNJUSTLY AND IMPIOUSLY SHALL GO TO THE HOUSE
OF VENGEANCE AND PUNISHMENT WHICH IS CALLED TARTARUS
AND IN THE TIME
OF CRONOS AND EVEN QUITE LATELY IN THE REIGN OF ZEUS THE JUDGMENT
WAS GIVEN ON THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THE MEN WERE TO DIE THE JUDGES
WERE ALIVE AND THE MEN WERE ALIVE AND THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE
JUDGMENTS WERE NOT WELL GIVEN
THEN PLUTO AND THE AUTHORITIES FROM THE
ISLANDS OF THE BLESSED CAME TO ZEUS AND SAID THAT THE SOULS FOUND THEIR
WAY TO THE WRONG PLACES
ZEUS SAID 'I SHALL PUT A STOP TO THIS THE
JUDGMENTS ARE NOT WELL GIVEN BECAUSE THE PERSONS WHO ARE JUDGED HAVE
THEIR CLOTHES ON FOR THEY ARE ALIVE AND THERE ARE MANY WHO HAVING
EVIL SOULS ARE APPARELLED IN FAIR BODIES OR ENCASED IN WEALTH OR RANK
AND WHEN THE DAY OF JUDGMENT ARRIVES NUMEROUS WITNESSES COME FORWARD
AND TESTIFY ON THEIR BEHALF THAT THEY HAVE LIVED RIGHTEOUSLY
THE JUDGES
ARE AWED BY THEM AND THEY THEMSELVES TOO HAVE THEIR CLOTHES ON WHEN
JUDGING THEIR EYES AND EARS AND THEIR WHOLE BODIES ARE INTERPOSED AS A
VEIL BEFORE THEIR OWN SOULS
ALL THIS IS A HINDRANCE TO THEM THERE ARE
THE CLOTHES OF THE JUDGES AND THE CLOTHES OF THE JUDGED WHAT IS TO BE
DONE I WILL TELL YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE I WILL DEPRIVE MEN OF THE
FOREKNOWLEDGE OF DEATH WHICH THEY POSSESS AT PRESENT THIS POWER WHICH
THEY HAVE PROMETHEUS HAS ALREADY RECEIVED MY ORDERS TO TAKE FROM THEM
IN THE SECOND PLACE THEY SHALL BE ENTIRELY STRIPPED BEFORE THEY ARE
JUDGED FOR THEY SHALL BE JUDGED WHEN THEY ARE DEAD AND THE JUDGE
TOO SHALL BE NAKED THAT IS TO SAY DEAD HE WITH HIS NAKED SOUL SHALL
PIERCE INTO THE OTHER NAKED SOULS AND THEY SHALL DIE SUDDENLY AND BE
DEPRIVED OF ALL THEIR KINDRED AND LEAVE THEIR BRAVE ATTIRE STREWN UPON
THE EARTH CONDUCTED IN THIS MANNER THE JUDGMENT WILL BE JUST
I KNEW
ALL ABOUT THE MATTER BEFORE ANY OF YOU AND THEREFORE I HAVE MADE MY
SONS JUDGES TWO FROM ASIA MINOS AND RHADAMANTHUS AND ONE FROM EUROPE
AEACUS
AND THESE WHEN THEY ARE DEAD SHALL GIVE JUDGMENT IN THE
MEADOW AT THE PARTING OF THE WAYS WHENCE THE TWO ROADS LEAD ONE TO THE
ISLANDS OF THE BLESSED AND THE OTHER TO TARTARUS
RHADAMANTHUS SHALL
JUDGE THOSE WHO COME FROM ASIA AND AEACUS THOSE WHO COME FROM EUROPE
AND TO MINOS I SHALL GIVE THE PRIMACY AND HE SHALL HOLD A COURT OF
APPEAL IN CASE EITHER OF THE TWO OTHERS ARE IN ANY DOUBT THEN
THE JUDGMENT RESPECTING THE LAST JOURNEY OF MEN WILL BE AS JUST AS
POSSIBLE
FROM THIS TALE CALLICLES WHICH I HAVE HEARD AND BELIEVE I DRAW THE
FOLLOWING INFERENCES DEATH IF I AM RIGHT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE
SEPARATION FROM ONE ANOTHER OF TWO THINGS SOUL AND BODY NOTHING ELSE
AND AFTER THEY ARE SEPARATED THEY RETAIN THEIR SEVERAL NATURES AS IN
LIFE THE BODY KEEPS THE SAME HABIT AND THE RESULTS OF TREATMENT OR
ACCIDENT ARE DISTINCTLY VISIBLE IN IT FOR EXAMPLE HE WHO BY NATURE OR
TRAINING OR BOTH WAS A TALL MAN WHILE HE WAS ALIVE WILL REMAIN AS HE
WAS AFTER HE IS DEAD AND THE FAT MAN WILL REMAIN FAT AND SO ON AND
THE DEAD MAN WHO IN LIFE HAD A FANCY TO HAVE FLOWING HAIR WILL HAVE
FLOWING HAIR
AND IF HE WAS MARKED WITH THE WHIP AND HAD THE PRINTS OF
THE SCOURGE OR OF WOUNDS IN HIM WHEN HE WAS ALIVE YOU MIGHT SEE THE
SAME IN THE DEAD BODY AND IF HIS LIMBS WERE BROKEN OR MISSHAPEN WHEN
HE WAS ALIVE THE SAME APPEARANCE WOULD BE VISIBLE IN THE DEAD
AND IN
A WORD WHATEVER WAS THE HABIT OF THE BODY DURING LIFE WOULD BE
DISTINGUISHABLE AFTER DEATH EITHER PERFECTLY OR IN A GREAT MEASURE AND
FOR A CERTAIN TIME
AND I SHOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS IS EQUALLY TRUE OF
THE SOUL CALLICLES WHEN A MAN IS STRIPPED OF THE BODY ALL THE NATURAL
OR ACQUIRED AFFECTIONS OF THE SOUL ARE LAID OPEN TO VIEW AND WHEN THEY
COME TO THE JUDGE AS THOSE FROM ASIA COME TO RHADAMANTHUS HE PLACES
THEM NEAR HIM AND INSPECTS THEM QUITE IMPARTIALLY NOT KNOWING WHOSE THE
SOUL IS PERHAPS HE MAY LAY HANDS ON THE SOUL OF THE GREAT KING OR OF
SOME OTHER KING OR POTENTATE WHO HAS NO SOUNDNESS IN HIM BUT HIS
SOUL IS MARKED WITH THE WHIP AND IS FULL OF THE PRINTS AND SCARS OF
PERJURIES AND CRIMES WITH WHICH EACH ACTION HAS STAINED HIM AND HE
IS ALL CROOKED WITH FALSEHOOD AND IMPOSTURE AND HAS NO STRAIGHTNESS
BECAUSE HE HAS LIVED WITHOUT TRUTH
HIM RHADAMANTHUS BEHOLDS FULL OF
ALL DEFORMITY AND DISPROPORTION WHICH IS CAUSED BY LICENCE AND LUXURY
AND INSOLENCE AND INCONTINENCE AND DESPATCHES HIM IGNOMINIOUSLY TO HIS
PRISON AND THERE HE UNDERGOES THE PUNISHMENT WHICH HE DESERVES
NOW THE PROPER OFFICE OF PUNISHMENT IS TWOFOLD HE WHO IS RIGHTLY
PUNISHED OUGHT EITHER TO BECOME BETTER AND PROFIT BY IT OR HE OUGHT TO
BE MADE AN EXAMPLE TO HIS FELLOWS THAT THEY MAY SEE WHAT HE SUFFERS
AND FEAR AND BECOME BETTER
THOSE WHO ARE IMPROVED WHEN THEY ARE
PUNISHED BY GODS AND MEN ARE THOSE WHOSE SINS ARE CURABLE AND THEY ARE
IMPROVED AS IN THIS WORLD SO ALSO IN ANOTHER BY PAIN AND SUFFERING
FOR THERE IS NO OTHER WAY IN WHICH THEY CAN BE DELIVERED FROM THEIR
EVIL
BUT THEY WHO HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF THE WORST CRIMES AND ARE
INCURABLE BY REASON OF THEIR CRIMES ARE MADE EXAMPLES FOR AS THEY ARE
INCURABLE THE TIME HAS PASSED AT WHICH THEY CAN RECEIVE ANY BENEFIT
THEY GET NO GOOD THEMSELVES BUT OTHERS GET GOOD WHEN THEY BEHOLD THEM
ENDURING FOR EVER THE MOST TERRIBLE AND PAINFUL AND FEARFUL SUFFERINGS
AS THE PENALTY OF THEIR SINS THERE THEY ARE HANGING UP AS EXAMPLES
IN THE PRISON HOUSE OF THE WORLD BELOW A SPECTACLE AND A WARNING TO
ALL UNRIGHTEOUS MEN WHO COME THITHER
AND AMONG THEM AS I CONFIDENTLY
AFFIRM WILL BE FOUND ARCHELAUS IF POLUS TRULY REPORTS OF HIM AND
ANY OTHER TYRANT WHO IS LIKE HIM
OF THESE FEARFUL EXAMPLES MOST AS
I BELIEVE ARE TAKEN FROM THE CLASS OF TYRANTS AND KINGS AND POTENTATES
AND PUBLIC MEN FOR THEY ARE THE AUTHORS OF THE GREATEST AND MOST
IMPIOUS CRIMES BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE POWER
AND HOMER WITNESSES TO
THE TRUTH OF THIS FOR THEY ARE ALWAYS KINGS AND POTENTATES WHOM HE HAS
DESCRIBED AS SUFFERING EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT IN THE WORLD BELOW
SUCH WERE TANTALUS AND SISYPHUS AND TITYUS
BUT NO ONE EVER DESCRIBED
THERSITES OR ANY PRIVATE PERSON WHO WAS A VILLAIN AS SUFFERING
EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT OR AS INCURABLE
FOR TO COMMIT THE WORST CRIMES
AS I AM INCLINED TO THINK WAS NOT IN HIS POWER AND HE WAS HAPPIER THAN
THOSE WHO HAD THE POWER
NO CALLICLES THE VERY BAD MEN COME FROM THE
CLASS OF THOSE WHO HAVE POWER COMPARE REPUBLIC
AND YET IN THAT VERY
CLASS THERE MAY ARISE GOOD MEN AND WORTHY OF ALL ADMIRATION THEY ARE
FOR WHERE THERE IS GREAT POWER TO DO WRONG TO LIVE AND TO DIE JUSTLY IS
A HARD THING AND GREATLY TO BE PRAISED AND FEW THERE ARE WHO ATTAIN
TO THIS
SUCH GOOD AND TRUE MEN HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE
AGAIN AT ATHENS AND IN OTHER STATES WHO HAVE FULFILLED THEIR TRUST
RIGHTEOUSLY AND THERE IS ONE WHO IS QUITE FAMOUS ALL OVER HELLAS
ARISTEIDES THE SON OF LYSIMACHUS
BUT IN GENERAL GREAT MEN ARE ALSO
BAD MY FRIEND
AS I WAS SAYING RHADAMANTHUS WHEN HE GETS A SOUL OF THE BAD KIND
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HIM NEITHER WHO HE IS NOR WHO HIS PARENTS ARE HE
KNOWS ONLY THAT HE HAS GOT HOLD OF A VILLAIN AND SEEING THIS HE STAMPS
HIM AS CURABLE OR INCURABLE AND SENDS HIM AWAY TO TARTARUS WHITHER
HE GOES AND RECEIVES HIS PROPER RECOMPENSE
OR AGAIN HE LOOKS WITH
ADMIRATION ON THE SOUL OF SOME JUST ONE WHO HAS LIVED IN HOLINESS
AND TRUTH HE MAY HAVE BEEN A PRIVATE MAN OR NOT AND I SHOULD SAY
CALLICLES THAT HE IS MOST LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN A PHILOSOPHER WHO HAS
DONE HIS OWN WORK AND NOT TROUBLED HIMSELF WITH THE DOINGS OF OTHER MEN
IN HIS LIFETIME HIM RHADAMANTHUS SENDS TO THE ISLANDS OF THE BLESSED
AEACUS DOES THE SAME AND THEY BOTH HAVE SCEPTRES AND JUDGE BUT MINOS
ALONE HAS A GOLDEN SCEPTRE AND IS SEATED LOOKING ON AS ODYSSEUS IN
HOMER DECLARES THAT HE SAW HIM
'HOLDING A SCEPTRE OF GOLD AND GIVING LAWS TO THE DEAD
NOW I CALLICLES AM PERSUADED OF THE TRUTH OF THESE THINGS AND I
CONSIDER HOW I SHALL PRESENT MY SOUL WHOLE AND UNDEFILED BEFORE THE
JUDGE IN THAT DAY
RENOUNCING THE HONOURS AT WHICH THE WORLD AIMS I
DESIRE ONLY TO KNOW THE TRUTH AND TO LIVE AS WELL AS I CAN AND WHEN
I DIE TO DIE AS WELL AS I CAN
AND TO THE UTMOST OF MY POWER I EXHORT
ALL OTHER MEN TO DO THE SAME
AND IN RETURN FOR YOUR EXHORTATION OF ME
I EXHORT YOU ALSO TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT COMBAT WHICH IS THE COMBAT
OF LIFE AND GREATER THAN EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONFLICT
AND I RETORT
YOUR REPROACH OF ME AND SAY THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP YOURSELF
WHEN THE DAY OF TRIAL AND JUDGMENT OF WHICH I WAS SPEAKING COMES UPON
YOU YOU WILL GO BEFORE THE JUDGE THE SON OF AEGINA AND WHEN HE HAS
GOT YOU IN HIS GRIP AND IS CARRYING YOU OFF YOU WILL GAPE AND YOUR HEAD
WILL SWIM ROUND JUST AS MINE WOULD IN THE COURTS OF THIS WORLD AND
VERY LIKELY SOME ONE WILL SHAMEFULLY BOX YOU ON THE EARS AND PUT UPON
YOU ANY SORT OF INSULT
PERHAPS THIS MAY APPEAR TO YOU TO BE ONLY AN OLD WIFE'S TALE WHICH YOU
WILL CONTEMN
AND THERE MIGHT BE REASON IN YOUR CONTEMNING SUCH TALES
IF BY SEARCHING WE COULD FIND OUT ANYTHING BETTER OR TRUER BUT NOW
YOU SEE THAT YOU AND POLUS AND GORGIAS WHO ARE THE THREE WISEST OF THE
GREEKS OF OUR DAY ARE NOT ABLE TO SHOW THAT WE OUGHT TO LIVE ANY LIFE
WHICH DOES NOT PROFIT IN ANOTHER WORLD AS WELL AS IN THIS
AND OF ALL
THAT HAS BEEN SAID NOTHING REMAINS UNSHAKEN BUT THE SAYING THAT TO DO
INJUSTICE IS MORE TO BE AVOIDED THAN TO SUFFER INJUSTICE AND THAT THE
REALITY AND NOT THE APPEARANCE OF VIRTUE IS TO BE FOLLOWED ABOVE ALL
THINGS AS WELL IN PUBLIC AS IN PRIVATE LIFE AND THAT WHEN ANY ONE HAS
BEEN WRONG IN ANYTHING HE IS TO BE CHASTISED AND THAT THE NEXT
BEST THING TO A MAN BEING JUST IS THAT HE SHOULD BECOME JUST AND
BE CHASTISED AND PUNISHED ALSO THAT HE SHOULD AVOID ALL FLATTERY OF
HIMSELF AS WELL AS OF OTHERS OF THE FEW OR OF THE MANY AND RHETORIC
AND ANY OTHER ART SHOULD BE USED BY HIM AND ALL HIS ACTIONS SHOULD BE
DONE ALWAYS WITH A VIEW TO JUSTICE
FOLLOW ME THEN AND I WILL LEAD YOU WHERE YOU WILL BE HAPPY IN LIFE AND
AFTER DEATH AS THE ARGUMENT SHOWS
AND NEVER MIND IF SOME ONE DESPISES
YOU AS A FOOL AND INSULTS YOU IF HE HAS A MIND LET HIM STRIKE YOU BY
ZEUS AND DO YOU BE OF GOOD CHEER AND DO NOT MIND THE INSULTING BLOW
FOR YOU WILL NEVER COME TO ANY HARM IN THE PRACTICE OF VIRTUE IF YOU
ARE A REALLY GOOD AND TRUE MAN
WHEN WE HAVE PRACTISED VIRTUE TOGETHER
WE WILL APPLY OURSELVES TO POLITICS IF THAT SEEMS DESIRABLE OR WE WILL
ADVISE ABOUT WHATEVER ELSE MAY SEEM GOOD TO US FOR WE SHALL BE BETTER
ABLE TO JUDGE THEN
IN OUR PRESENT CONDITION WE OUGHT NOT TO GIVE
OURSELVES AIRS FOR EVEN ON THE MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECTS WE ARE ALWAYS
CHANGING OUR MINDS SO UTTERLY STUPID ARE WE LET US THEN TAKE THE
ARGUMENT AS OUR GUIDE WHICH HAS REVEALED TO US THAT THE BEST WAY OF
LIFE IS TO PRACTISE JUSTICE AND EVERY VIRTUE IN LIFE AND DEATH
THIS WAY
LET US GO AND IN THIS EXHORT ALL MEN TO FOLLOW NOT IN THE WAY TO
WHICH YOU TRUST AND IN WHICH YOU EXHORT ME TO FOLLOW YOU FOR THAT WAY
