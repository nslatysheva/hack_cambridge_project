TEXT OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS ON TUESDAY AS
PREPARED FOR DELIVERY AND RELEASED BY THE PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL
COMMITTEE
OBAMA MY FELLOW CITIZENS
I STAND HERE TODAY HUMBLED BY THE TASK BEFORE US GRATEFUL FOR THE TRUST
YOU HAVE BESTOWED MINDFUL OF THE SACRIFICES BORNE BY OUR ANCESTORS
I
THANK PRESIDENT BUSH FOR HIS SERVICE TO OUR NATION AS WELL AS THE
GENEROSITY AND COOPERATION HE HAS SHOWN THROUGHOUT THIS TRANSITION
FORTY FOUR AMERICANS HAVE NOW TAKEN THE PRESIDENTIAL OATH
THE WORDS
HAVE BEEN SPOKEN DURING RISING TIDES OF PROSPERITY AND THE STILL WATERS
OF PEACE
YET EVERY SO OFTEN THE OATH IS TAKEN AMIDST GATHERING CLOUDS
AND RAGING STORMS
AT THESE MOMENTS AMERICA HAS CARRIED ON NOT SIMPLY
BECAUSE OF THE SKILL OR VISION OF THOSE IN HIGH OFFICE BUT BECAUSE WE
THE PEOPLE HAVE REMAINED FAITHFUL TO THE IDEALS OF OUR FOREBEARS AND
TRUE TO OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS
SO IT HAS BEEN
SO IT MUST BE WITH THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS
THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF CRISIS IS NOW WELL UNDERSTOOD
OUR NATION IS
AT WAR AGAINST A FAR REACHING NETWORK OF VIOLENCE AND HATRED
OUR
ECONOMY IS BADLY WEAKENED A CONSEQUENCE OF GREED AND IRRESPONSIBILITY
ON THE PART OF SOME BUT ALSO OUR COLLECTIVE FAILURE TO MAKE HARD
CHOICES AND PREPARE THE NATION FOR A NEW AGE
HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST JOBS
SHED BUSINESSES SHUTTERED
OUR HEALTH CARE IS TOO COSTLY OUR SCHOOLS
FAIL TOO MANY AND EACH DAY BRINGS FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT THE WAYS WE USE
ENERGY STRENGTHEN OUR ADVERSARIES AND THREATEN OUR PLANET
THESE ARE THE INDICATORS OF CRISIS SUBJECT TO DATA AND STATISTICS
LESS MEASURABLE BUT NO LESS PROFOUND IS A SAPPING OF CONFIDENCE ACROSS
OUR LAND A NAGGING FEAR THAT AMERICA'S DECLINE IS INEVITABLE AND
THAT THE NEXT GENERATION MUST LOWER ITS SIGHTS
TODAY I SAY TO YOU THAT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE REAL
THEY ARE
SERIOUS AND THEY ARE MANY
THEY WILL NOT BE MET EASILY OR IN A SHORT
SPAN OF TIME
BUT KNOW THIS AMERICA THEY WILL BE MET
ON THIS DAY WE GATHER BECAUSE WE HAVE CHOSEN HOPE OVER FEAR UNITY OF
PURPOSE OVER CONFLICT AND DISCORD
ON THIS DAY WE COME TO PROCLAIM AN END TO THE PETTY GRIEVANCES AND
FALSE PROMISES THE RECRIMINATIONS AND WORN OUT DOGMAS THAT FOR FAR TOO
LONG HAVE STRANGLED OUR POLITICS
WE REMAIN A YOUNG NATION BUT IN THE WORDS OF SCRIPTURE THE TIME HAS
COME TO SET ASIDE CHILDISH THINGS
THE TIME HAS COME TO REAFFIRM OUR
ENDURING SPIRIT TO CHOOSE OUR BETTER HISTORY TO CARRY FORWARD THAT
PRECIOUS GIFT THAT NOBLE IDEA PASSED ON FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
THE GOD GIVEN PROMISE THAT ALL ARE EQUAL ALL ARE FREE AND ALL DESERVE A
CHANCE TO PURSUE THEIR FULL MEASURE OF HAPPINESS
IN REAFFIRMING THE GREATNESS OF OUR NATION WE UNDERSTAND THAT GREATNESS
IS NEVER A GIVEN
IT MUST BE EARNED
OUR JOURNEY HAS NEVER BEEN ONE OF
SHORTCUTS OR SETTLING FOR LESS
IT HAS NOT BEEN THE PATH FOR THE
FAINT HEARTED FOR THOSE WHO PREFER LEISURE OVER WORK OR SEEK ONLY
THE PLEASURES OF RICHES AND FAME
RATHER IT HAS BEEN THE RISK TAKERS
THE DOERS THE MAKERS OF THINGS SOME CELEBRATED BUT MORE OFTEN MEN
AND WOMEN OBSCURE IN THEIR LABOR WHO HAVE CARRIED US UP THE LONG
RUGGED PATH TOWARDS PROSPERITY AND FREEDOM
FOR US THEY PACKED UP THEIR FEW WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AND TRAVELED ACROSS
OCEANS IN SEARCH OF A NEW LIFE
FOR US THEY TOILED IN SWEATSHOPS AND SETTLED THE WEST ENDURED THE LASH
OF THE WHIP AND PLOWED THE HARD EARTH
FOR US THEY FOUGHT AND DIED IN PLACES LIKE CONCORD AND GETTYSBURG
NORMANDY AND KHE SAHN
TIME AND AGAIN THESE MEN AND WOMEN STRUGGLED AND SACRIFICED AND WORKED
TILL THEIR HANDS WERE RAW SO THAT WE MIGHT LIVE A BETTER LIFE
THEY SAW
AMERICA AS BIGGER THAN THE SUM OF OUR INDIVIDUAL AMBITIONS GREATER THAN
ALL THE DIFFERENCES OF BIRTH OR WEALTH OR FACTION
THIS IS THE JOURNEY WE CONTINUE TODAY
WE REMAIN THE MOST PROSPEROUS
POWERFUL NATION ON EARTH
OUR WORKERS ARE NO LESS PRODUCTIVE THAN WHEN
THIS CRISIS BEGAN
OUR MINDS ARE NO LESS INVENTIVE OUR GOODS AND
SERVICES NO LESS NEEDED THAN THEY WERE LAST WEEK OR LAST MONTH OR LAST
YEAR
OUR CAPACITY REMAINS UNDIMINISHED
BUT OUR TIME OF STANDING PAT
OF PROTECTING NARROW INTERESTS AND PUTTING OFF UNPLEASANT DECISIONS
THAT TIME HAS SURELY PASSED
STARTING TODAY WE MUST PICK OURSELVES UP
DUST OURSELVES OFF AND BEGIN AGAIN THE WORK OF REMAKING AMERICA
FOR EVERYWHERE WE LOOK THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE
THE STATE OF THE
ECONOMY CALLS FOR ACTION BOLD AND SWIFT AND WE WILL ACT NOT ONLY TO
CREATE NEW JOBS BUT TO LAY A NEW FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH
WE WILL BUILD
THE ROADS AND BRIDGES THE ELECTRIC GRIDS AND DIGITAL LINES THAT FEED
OUR COMMERCE AND BIND US TOGETHER
WE WILL RESTORE SCIENCE TO ITS
RIGHTFUL PLACE AND WIELD TECHNOLOGY'S WONDERS TO RAISE HEALTH CARE'S
QUALITY AND LOWER ITS COST
WE WILL HARNESS THE SUN AND THE WINDS AND
THE SOIL TO FUEL OUR CARS AND RUN OUR FACTORIES
AND WE WILL TRANSFORM
OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF A NEW
AGE
ALL THIS WE CAN DO
AND ALL THIS WE WILL DO
NOW THERE ARE SOME WHO QUESTION THE SCALE OF OUR AMBITIONS WHO
SUGGEST THAT OUR SYSTEM CANNOT TOLERATE TOO MANY BIG PLANS
THEIR
MEMORIES ARE SHORT
FOR THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS
ALREADY DONE WHAT FREE MEN AND WOMEN CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IMAGINATION IS
JOINED TO COMMON PURPOSE AND NECESSITY TO COURAGE
WHAT THE CYNICS FAIL TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE GROUND HAS SHIFTED
BENEATH THEM THAT THE STALE POLITICAL ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE CONSUMED US
FOR SO LONG NO LONGER APPLY
THE QUESTION WE ASK TODAY IS NOT WHETHER
OUR GOVERNMENT IS TOO BIG OR TOO SMALL BUT WHETHER IT WORKS WHETHER
IT HELPS FAMILIES FIND JOBS AT A DECENT WAGE CARE THEY CAN AFFORD A
RETIREMENT THAT IS DIGNIFIED
WHERE THE ANSWER IS YES WE INTEND TO MOVE
FORWARD
WHERE THE ANSWER IS NO PROGRAMS WILL END
AND THOSE OF US WHO
MANAGE THE PUBLIC'S DOLLARS WILL BE HELD TO ACCOUNT TO SPEND WISELY
REFORM BAD HABITS AND DO OUR BUSINESS IN THE LIGHT OF DAY BECAUSE
ONLY THEN CAN WE RESTORE THE VITAL TRUST BETWEEN A PEOPLE AND THEIR
GOVERNMENT
NOR IS THE QUESTION BEFORE US WHETHER THE MARKET IS A FORCE FOR GOOD OR
ILL
ITS POWER TO GENERATE WEALTH AND EXPAND FREEDOM IS UNMATCHED BUT
THIS CRISIS HAS REMINDED US THAT WITHOUT A WATCHFUL EYE THE MARKET CAN
SPIN OUT OF CONTROL AND THAT A NATION CANNOT PROSPER LONG WHEN IT
FAVORS ONLY THE PROSPEROUS
THE SUCCESS OF OUR ECONOMY HAS ALWAYS
DEPENDED NOT JUST ON THE SIZE OF OUR GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BUT ON THE
REACH OF OUR PROSPERITY ON OUR ABILITY TO EXTEND OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY
WILLING HEART NOT OUT OF CHARITY BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE SUREST ROUTE
TO OUR COMMON GOOD
AS FOR OUR COMMON DEFENSE WE REJECT AS FALSE THE CHOICE BETWEEN OUR
SAFETY AND OUR IDEALS
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS FACED WITH PERILS WE CAN
SCARCELY IMAGINE DRAFTED A CHARTER TO ASSURE THE RULE OF LAW AND THE
RIGHTS OF MAN A CHARTER EXPANDED BY THE BLOOD OF GENERATIONS
THOSE
IDEALS STILL LIGHT THE WORLD AND WE WILL NOT GIVE THEM UP FOR
EXPEDIENCE'S SAKE
AND SO TO ALL OTHER PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE
WATCHING TODAY FROM THE GRANDEST CAPITALS TO THE SMALL VILLAGE WHERE MY
FATHER WAS BORN KNOW THAT AMERICA IS A FRIEND OF EACH NATION AND EVERY
MAN WOMAN AND CHILD WHO SEEKS A FUTURE OF PEACE AND DIGNITY AND THAT
WE ARE READY TO LEAD ONCE MORE
RECALL THAT EARLIER GENERATIONS FACED DOWN FASCISM AND COMMUNISM NOT
JUST WITH MISSILES AND TANKS BUT WITH STURDY ALLIANCES AND ENDURING
CONVICTIONS
THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR POWER ALONE CANNOT PROTECT US NOR
DOES IT ENTITLE US TO DO AS WE PLEASE
INSTEAD THEY KNEW THAT OUR POWER
GROWS THROUGH ITS PRUDENT USE OUR SECURITY EMANATES FROM THE JUSTNESS
OF OUR CAUSE THE FORCE OF OUR EXAMPLE THE TEMPERING QUALITIES OF
HUMILITY AND RESTRAINT
WE ARE THE KEEPERS OF THIS LEGACY
GUIDED BY THESE PRINCIPLES ONCE MORE
WE CAN MEET THOSE NEW THREATS THAT DEMAND EVEN GREATER EFFORT EVEN
GREATER COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN NATIONS
WE WILL BEGIN TO
RESPONSIBLY LEAVE IRAQ TO ITS PEOPLE AND FORGE A HARD EARNED PEACE IN
AFGHANISTAN
WITH OLD FRIENDS AND FORMER FOES WE WILL WORK TIRELESSLY
TO LESSEN THE NUCLEAR THREAT AND ROLL BACK THE SPECTER OF A WARMING
PLANET
WE WILL NOT APOLOGIZE FOR OUR WAY OF LIFE NOR WILL WE WAVER IN
ITS DEFENSE AND FOR THOSE WHO SEEK TO ADVANCE THEIR AIMS BY INDUCING
TERROR AND SLAUGHTERING INNOCENTS WE SAY TO YOU NOW THAT OUR SPIRIT IS
STRONGER AND CANNOT BE BROKEN YOU CANNOT OUTLAST US AND WE WILL DEFEAT
YOU
FOR WE KNOW THAT OUR PATCHWORK HERITAGE IS A STRENGTH NOT A WEAKNESS
WE ARE A NATION OF CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS JEWS AND HINDUS AND
NON BELIEVERS
WE ARE SHAPED BY EVERY LANGUAGE AND CULTURE DRAWN FROM
EVERY END OF THIS EARTH AND BECAUSE WE HAVE TASTED THE BITTER SWILL OF
CIVIL WAR AND SEGREGATION AND EMERGED FROM THAT DARK CHAPTER STRONGER
AND MORE UNITED WE CANNOT HELP BUT BELIEVE THAT THE OLD HATREDS SHALL
SOMEDAY PASS THAT THE LINES OF TRIBE SHALL SOON DISSOLVE THAT AS THE
WORLD GROWS SMALLER OUR COMMON HUMANITY SHALL REVEAL ITSELF AND THAT
AMERICA MUST PLAY ITS ROLE IN USHERING IN A NEW ERA OF PEACE
TO THE MUSLIM WORLD WE SEEK A NEW WAY FORWARD BASED ON MUTUAL INTEREST
AND MUTUAL RESPECT
TO THOSE LEADERS AROUND THE GLOBE WHO SEEK TO SOW
CONFLICT OR BLAME THEIR SOCIETY'S ILLS ON THE WEST KNOW THAT YOUR
PEOPLE WILL JUDGE YOU ON WHAT YOU CAN BUILD NOT WHAT YOU DESTROY
TO
THOSE WHO CLING TO POWER THROUGH CORRUPTION AND DECEIT AND THE SILENCING
OF DISSENT KNOW THAT YOU ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY BUT THAT WE
WILL EXTEND A HAND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO UNCLENCH YOUR FIST
TO THE PEOPLE OF POOR NATIONS WE PLEDGE TO WORK ALONGSIDE YOU TO MAKE
YOUR FARMS FLOURISH AND LET CLEAN WATERS FLOW TO NOURISH STARVED BODIES
AND FEED HUNGRY MINDS
AND TO THOSE NATIONS LIKE OURS THAT ENJOY
RELATIVE PLENTY WE SAY WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD INDIFFERENCE TO
SUFFERING OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS NOR CAN WE CONSUME THE WORLD'S RESOURCES
WITHOUT REGARD TO EFFECT
FOR THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND WE MUST CHANGE
WITH IT
AS WE CONSIDER THE ROAD THAT UNFOLDS BEFORE US WE REMEMBER WITH HUMBLE
GRATITUDE THOSE BRAVE AMERICANS WHO AT THIS VERY HOUR PATROL FAR OFF
DESERTS AND DISTANT MOUNTAINS
THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL US TODAY
JUST AS THE FALLEN HEROES WHO LIE IN ARLINGTON WHISPER THROUGH THE
AGES
WE HONOR THEM NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE GUARDIANS OF OUR LIBERTY
BUT BECAUSE THEY EMBODY THE SPIRIT OF SERVICE A WILLINGNESS TO FIND
MEANING IN SOMETHING GREATER THAN THEMSELVES
AND YET AT THIS MOMENT
A MOMENT THAT WILL DEFINE A GENERATION IT IS PRECISELY THIS SPIRIT
THAT MUST INHABIT US ALL
FOR AS MUCH AS GOVERNMENT CAN DO AND MUST DO IT IS ULTIMATELY THE FAITH
AND DETERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UPON WHICH THIS NATION
RELIES
IT IS THE KINDNESS TO TAKE IN A STRANGER WHEN THE LEVEES BREAK
THE SELFLESSNESS OF WORKERS WHO WOULD RATHER CUT THEIR HOURS THAN SEE A
FRIEND LOSE THEIR JOB WHICH SEES US THROUGH OUR DARKEST HOURS
IT IS THE
FIREFIGHTER'S COURAGE TO STORM A STAIRWAY FILLED WITH SMOKE BUT ALSO A
PARENT'S WILLINGNESS TO NURTURE A CHILD THAT FINALLY DECIDES OUR FATE
OUR CHALLENGES MAY BE NEW
THE INSTRUMENTS WITH WHICH WE MEET THEM MAY
BE NEW
BUT THOSE VALUES UPON WHICH OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS HARD WORK AND
HONESTY COURAGE AND FAIR PLAY TOLERANCE AND CURIOSITY LOYALTY AND
PATRIOTISM THESE THINGS ARE OLD
THESE THINGS ARE TRUE
THEY HAVE
BEEN THE QUIET FORCE OF PROGRESS THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY
WHAT IS
DEMANDED THEN IS A RETURN TO THESE TRUTHS
WHAT IS REQUIRED OF US NOW IS
A NEW ERA OF RESPONSIBILITY A RECOGNITION ON THE PART OF EVERY
AMERICAN THAT WE HAVE DUTIES TO OURSELVES OUR NATION AND THE WORLD
DUTIES THAT WE DO NOT GRUDGINGLY ACCEPT BUT RATHER SEIZE GLADLY FIRM IN
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS NOTHING SO SATISFYING TO THE SPIRIT SO
DEFINING OF OUR CHARACTER THAN GIVING OUR ALL TO A DIFFICULT TASK
THIS IS THE PRICE AND THE PROMISE OF CITIZENSHIP
THIS IS THE SOURCE OF OUR CONFIDENCE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT GOD CALLS ON
US TO SHAPE AN UNCERTAIN DESTINY
THIS IS THE MEANING OF OUR LIBERTY AND OUR CREED WHY MEN AND WOMEN
AND CHILDREN OF EVERY RACE AND EVERY FAITH CAN JOIN IN CELEBRATION
ACROSS THIS MAGNIFICENT MALL AND WHY A MAN WHOSE FATHER LESS THAN SIXTY
YEARS AGO MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SERVED AT A LOCAL RESTAURANT CAN NOW STAND
BEFORE YOU TO TAKE A MOST SACRED OATH
SO LET US MARK THIS DAY WITH REMEMBRANCE OF WHO WE ARE AND HOW FAR WE
HAVE TRAVELED
IN THE YEAR OF AMERICA'S BIRTH IN THE COLDEST OF MONTHS
A SMALL BAND OF PATRIOTS HUDDLED BY DYING CAMPFIRES ON THE SHORES OF AN
ICY RIVER
THE CAPITAL WAS ABANDONED
THE ENEMY WAS ADVANCING
THE SNOW
WAS STAINED WITH BLOOD
AT A MOMENT WHEN THE OUTCOME OF OUR REVOLUTION
WAS MOST IN DOUBT THE FATHER OF OUR NATION ORDERED THESE WORDS BE READ
TO THE PEOPLE
LET IT BE TOLD TO THE FUTURE WORLD
THAT IN THE DEPTH OF WINTER
WHEN NOTHING BUT HOPE AND VIRTUE COULD SURVIVE THAT THE CITY AND THE
COUNTRY ALARMED AT ONE COMMON DANGER CAME FORTH TO MEET IT
AMERICA IN THE FACE OF OUR COMMON DANGERS IN THIS WINTER OF OUR
HARDSHIP LET US REMEMBER THESE TIMELESS WORDS
WITH HOPE AND VIRTUE
LET US BRAVE ONCE MORE THE ICY CURRENTS AND ENDURE WHAT STORMS MAY
COME
LET IT BE SAID BY OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN THAT WHEN WE WERE TESTED
WE REFUSED TO LET THIS JOURNEY END THAT WE DID NOT TURN BACK NOR DID WE
FALTER AND WITH EYES FIXED ON THE HORIZON AND GOD'S GRACE UPON US WE
CARRIED FORTH THAT GREAT GIFT OF FREEDOM AND DELIVERED IT SAFELY TO
FUTURE GENERATIONS
TEXT OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS ON MONDAY
JANUARY 21 2013
THE WHITE HOUSE
OFFICE OF THE PRESS SECRETARY
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE JANUARY 21 2013
INAUGURAL ADDRESS BY PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA
UNITED STATES CAPITOL
11 55 A M
EST
THE PRESIDENT VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MR
CHIEF JUSTICE
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND FELLOW
CITIZENS
EACH TIME WE GATHER TO INAUGURATE A PRESIDENT WE BEAR WITNESS TO THE
ENDURING STRENGTH OF OUR CONSTITUTION
WE AFFIRM THE PROMISE OF OUR
DEMOCRACY
WE RECALL THAT WHAT BINDS THIS NATION TOGETHER IS NOT THE
COLORS OF OUR SKIN OR THE TENETS OF OUR FAITH OR THE ORIGINS OF OUR
NAMES
WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL WHAT MAKES US AMERICAN IS OUR
ALLEGIANCE TO AN IDEA ARTICULATED IN A DECLARATION MADE MORE THAN TWO
CENTURIES AGO
WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED
EQUAL THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE
RIGHTS THAT AMONG THESE ARE LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF
HAPPINESS
TODAY WE CONTINUE A NEVER ENDING JOURNEY TO BRIDGE THE MEANING OF THOSE
WORDS WITH THE REALITIES OF OUR TIME
FOR HISTORY TELLS US THAT WHILE
THESE TRUTHS MAY BE SELF EVIDENT THEYVE NEVER BEEN SELF EXECUTING
THAT WHILE FREEDOM IS A GIFT FROM GOD IT MUST BE SECURED BY HIS PEOPLE
HERE ON EARTH
APPLAUSE THE PATRIOTS OF 1776 DID NOT FIGHT TO
REPLACE THE TYRANNY OF A KING WITH THE PRIVILEGES OF A FEW OR THE RULE
OF A MOB
THEY GAVE TO US A REPUBLIC A GOVERNMENT OF AND BY AND FOR
THE PEOPLE ENTRUSTING EACH GENERATION TO KEEP SAFE OUR FOUNDING CREED
AND FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS WE HAVE
THROUGH BLOOD DRAWN BY LASH AND BLOOD DRAWN BY SWORD WE LEARNED THAT
NO UNION FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND EQUALITY COULD
SURVIVE HALF SLAVE AND HALF FREE
WE MADE OURSELVES ANEW AND VOWED TO
MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER
TOGETHER WE DETERMINED THAT A MODERN ECONOMY REQUIRES RAILROADS AND
HIGHWAYS TO SPEED TRAVEL AND COMMERCE SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES TO TRAIN
OUR WORKERS
TOGETHER WE DISCOVERED THAT A FREE MARKET ONLY THRIVES WHEN THERE ARE
RULES TO ENSURE COMPETITION AND FAIR PLAY
TOGETHER WE RESOLVED THAT A GREAT NATION MUST CARE FOR THE VULNERABLE
AND PROTECT ITS PEOPLE FROM LIFES WORST HAZARDS AND MISFORTUNE
THROUGH IT ALL WE HAVE NEVER RELINQUISHED OUR SKEPTICISM OF CENTRAL
AUTHORITY NOR HAVE WE SUCCUMBED TO THE FICTION THAT ALL SOCIETYS ILLS
CAN BE CURED THROUGH GOVERNMENT ALONE
OUR CELEBRATION OF INITIATIVE
AND ENTERPRISE OUR INSISTENCE ON HARD WORK AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
THESE ARE CONSTANTS IN OUR CHARACTER
BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT WHEN TIMES CHANGE SO MUST WE THAT
FIDELITY TO OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES NEW RESPONSES TO NEW
CHALLENGES THAT PRESERVING OUR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS ULTIMATELY REQUIRES
COLLECTIVE ACTION
FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN NO MORE MEET THE
DEMANDS OF TODAYS WORLD BY ACTING ALONE THAN AMERICAN SOLDIERS COULD
HAVE MET THE FORCES OF FASCISM OR COMMUNISM WITH MUSKETS AND MILITIAS
NO SINGLE PERSON CAN TRAIN ALL THE MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS WELL NEED
TO EQUIP OUR CHILDREN FOR THE FUTURE OR BUILD THE ROADS AND NETWORKS
AND RESEARCH LABS THAT WILL BRING NEW JOBS AND BUSINESSES TO OUR SHORES
NOW MORE THAN EVER WE MUST DO THESE THINGS TOGETHER AS ONE NATION
AND ONE PEOPLE
APPLAUSE
THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS HAS BEEN TESTED BY CRISES THAT STEELED OUR
RESOLVE AND PROVED OUR RESILIENCE
A DECADE OF WAR IS NOW ENDING
APPLAUSE AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS BEGUN
APPLAUSE AMERICAS
POSSIBILITIES ARE LIMITLESS FOR WE POSSESS ALL THE QUALITIES THAT THIS
WORLD WITHOUT BOUNDARIES DEMANDS YOUTH AND DRIVE DIVERSITY AND
OPENNESS AN ENDLESS CAPACITY FOR RISK AND A GIFT FOR REINVENTION
MY
FELLOW AMERICANS WE ARE MADE FOR THIS MOMENT AND WE WILL SEIZE IT
SO LONG AS WE SEIZE IT TOGETHER
APPLAUSE
FOR WE THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR COUNTRY CANNOT SUCCEED WHEN A
SHRINKING FEW DO VERY WELL AND A GROWING MANY BARELY MAKE IT
APPLAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT AMERICAS PROSPERITY MUST REST UPON THE
BROAD SHOULDERS OF A RISING MIDDLE CLASS
WE KNOW THAT AMERICA THRIVES
WHEN EVERY PERSON CAN FIND INDEPENDENCE AND PRIDE IN THEIR WORK WHEN
THE WAGES OF HONEST LABOR LIBERATE FAMILIES FROM THE BRINK OF HARDSHIP
WE ARE TRUE TO OUR CREED WHEN A LITTLE GIRL BORN INTO THE BLEAKEST
POVERTY KNOWS THAT SHE HAS THE SAME CHANCE TO SUCCEED AS ANYBODY ELSE
BECAUSE SHE IS AN AMERICAN SHE IS FREE AND SHE IS EQUAL NOT JUST IN
THE EYES OF GOD BUT ALSO IN OUR OWN
APPLAUSE
WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUTWORN PROGRAMS ARE INADEQUATE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR
TIME
SO WE MUST HARNESS NEW IDEAS AND TECHNOLOGY TO REMAKE OUR
GOVERNMENT REVAMP OUR TAX CODE REFORM OUR SCHOOLS AND EMPOWER OUR
CITIZENS WITH THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO WORK HARDER LEARN MORE REACH
HIGHER
BUT WHILE THE MEANS WILL CHANGE OUR PURPOSE ENDURES A
NATION THAT REWARDS THE EFFORT AND DETERMINATION OF EVERY SINGLE
AMERICAN
THAT IS WHAT THIS MOMENT REQUIRES
THAT IS WHAT WILL GIVE
REAL MEANING TO OUR CREED
WE THE PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE THAT EVERY CITIZEN DESERVES A BASIC
MEASURE OF SECURITY AND DIGNITY
WE MUST MAKE THE HARD CHOICES TO
REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE AND THE SIZE OF OUR DEFICIT
BUT WE
REJECT THE BELIEF THAT AMERICA MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING FOR THE
GENERATION THAT BUILT THIS COUNTRY AND INVESTING IN THE GENERATION THAT
WILL BUILD ITS FUTURE
APPLAUSE FOR WE REMEMBER THE LESSONS OF OUR
PAST WHEN TWILIGHT YEARS WERE SPENT IN POVERTY AND PARENTS OF A CHILD
WITH A DISABILITY HAD NOWHERE TO TURN
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY FREEDOM IS RESERVED FOR THE
LUCKY OR HAPPINESS FOR THE FEW
WE RECOGNIZE THAT NO MATTER HOW
RESPONSIBLY WE LIVE OUR LIVES ANY ONE OF US AT ANY TIME MAY FACE A JOB
LOSS OR A SUDDEN ILLNESS OR A HOME SWEPT AWAY IN A TERRIBLE STORM
THE COMMITMENTS WE MAKE TO EACH OTHER THROUGH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND
SOCIAL SECURITY THESE THINGS DO NOT SAP OUR INITIATIVE THEY
STRENGTHEN US
APPLAUSE THEY DO NOT MAKE US A NATION OF TAKERS
THEY FREE US TO TAKE THE RISKS THAT MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT
APPLAUSE
WE THE PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE THAT OUR OBLIGATIONS AS AMERICANS ARE NOT
JUST TO OURSELVES BUT TO ALL POSTERITY
WE WILL RESPOND TO THE THREAT
OF CLIMATE CHANGE KNOWING THAT THE FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD BETRAY OUR
CHILDREN AND FUTURE GENERATIONS
APPLAUSE SOME MAY STILL DENY THE
OVERWHELMING JUDGMENT OF SCIENCE BUT NONE CAN AVOID THE DEVASTATING
IMPACT OF RAGING FIRES AND CRIPPLING DROUGHT AND MORE POWERFUL STORMS
THE PATH TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES WILL BE LONG AND SOMETIMES
DIFFICULT
BUT AMERICA CANNOT RESIST THIS TRANSITION WE MUST LEAD IT
WE CANNOT CEDE TO OTHER NATIONS THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL POWER NEW JOBS
AND NEW INDUSTRIES WE MUST CLAIM ITS PROMISE
THATS HOW WE WILL
MAINTAIN OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY AND OUR NATIONAL TREASURE OUR FORESTS
AND WATERWAYS OUR CROP LANDS AND SNOW CAPPED PEAKS
THAT IS HOW WE
WILL PRESERVE OUR PLANET COMMANDED TO OUR CARE BY GOD
THATS WHAT
WILL LEND MEANING TO THE CREED OUR FATHERS ONCE DECLARED
WE THE PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE THAT ENDURING SECURITY AND LASTING PEACE
DO NOT REQUIRE PERPETUAL WAR
APPLAUSE OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN
UNIFORM TEMPERED BY THE FLAMES OF BATTLE ARE UNMATCHED IN SKILL AND
COURAGE
APPLAUSE OUR CITIZENS SEARED BY THE MEMORY OF THOSE WE
HAVE LOST KNOW TOO WELL THE PRICE THAT IS PAID FOR LIBERTY
THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SACRIFICE WILL KEEP US FOREVER VIGILANT AGAINST
THOSE WHO WOULD DO US HARM
BUT WE ARE ALSO HEIRS TO THOSE WHO WON THE
PEACE AND NOT JUST THE WAR WHO TURNED SWORN ENEMIES INTO THE SUREST OF
FRIENDS AND WE MUST CARRY THOSE LESSONS INTO THIS TIME AS WELL
WE WILL DEFEND OUR PEOPLE AND UPHOLD OUR VALUES THROUGH STRENGTH OF
ARMS AND RULE OF LAW
WE WILL SHOW THE COURAGE TO TRY AND RESOLVE OUR
DIFFERENCES WITH OTHER NATIONS PEACEFULLY NOT BECAUSE WE ARE NAVE
ABOUT THE DANGERS WE FACE BUT BECAUSE ENGAGEMENT CAN MORE DURABLY LIFT
SUSPICION AND FEAR
APPLAUSE
AMERICA WILL REMAIN THE ANCHOR OF STRONG ALLIANCES IN EVERY CORNER OF
THE GLOBE
AND WE WILL RENEW THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT EXTEND OUR
CAPACITY TO MANAGE CRISIS ABROAD FOR NO ONE HAS A GREATER STAKE IN A
PEACEFUL WORLD THAN ITS MOST POWERFUL NATION
WE WILL SUPPORT
DEMOCRACY FROM ASIA TO AFRICA FROM THE AMERICAS TO THE MIDDLE EAST
BECAUSE OUR INTERESTS AND OUR CONSCIENCE COMPEL US TO ACT ON BEHALF OF
THOSE WHO LONG FOR FREEDOM
AND WE MUST BE A SOURCE OF HOPE TO THE
POOR THE SICK THE MARGINALIZED THE VICTIMS OF PREJUDICE NOT OUT
OF MERE CHARITY BUT BECAUSE PEACE IN OUR TIME REQUIRES THE CONSTANT
ADVANCE OF THOSE PRINCIPLES THAT OUR COMMON CREED DESCRIBES TOLERANCE
AND OPPORTUNITY HUMAN DIGNITY AND JUSTICE
WE THE PEOPLE DECLARE TODAY THAT THE MOST EVIDENT OF TRUTHS THAT
ALL OF US ARE CREATED EQUAL IS THE STAR THAT GUIDES US STILL JUST
AS IT GUIDED OUR FOREBEARS THROUGH SENECA FALLS AND SELMA AND
STONEWALL JUST AS IT GUIDED ALL THOSE MEN AND WOMEN SUNG AND UNSUNG
WHO LEFT FOOTPRINTS ALONG THIS GREAT MALL TO HEAR A PREACHER SAY THAT
WE CANNOT WALK ALONE TO HEAR A KING PROCLAIM THAT OUR INDIVIDUAL
FREEDOM IS INEXTRICABLY BOUND TO THE FREEDOM OF EVERY SOUL ON EARTH
APPLAUSE
IT IS NOW OUR GENERATIONS TASK TO CARRY ON WHAT THOSE PIONEERS BEGAN
FOR OUR JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL OUR WIVES OUR MOTHERS AND
DAUGHTERS CAN EARN A LIVING EQUAL TO THEIR EFFORTS
APPLAUSE OUR
JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL OUR GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE TREATED
LIKE ANYONE ELSE UNDER THE LAW APPLAUSE FOR IF WE ARE TRULY
CREATED EQUAL THEN SURELY THE LOVE WE COMMIT TO ONE ANOTHER MUST BE
EQUAL AS WELL
APPLAUSE OUR JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL NO
CITIZEN IS FORCED TO WAIT FOR HOURS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE
APPLAUSE OUR JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL WE FIND A BETTER WAY TO
WELCOME THE STRIVING HOPEFUL IMMIGRANTS WHO STILL SEE AMERICA AS A
LAND OF OPPORTUNITY APPLAUSE UNTIL BRIGHT YOUNG STUDENTS AND
ENGINEERS ARE ENLISTED IN OUR WORKFORCE RATHER THAN EXPELLED FROM OUR
COUNTRY
APPLAUSE OUR JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL ALL OUR
CHILDREN FROM THE STREETS OF DETROIT TO THE HILLS OF APPALACHIA TO
THE QUIET LANES OF NEWTOWN KNOW THAT THEY ARE CARED FOR AND CHERISHED
AND ALWAYS SAFE FROM HARM
THAT IS OUR GENERATIONS TASK TO MAKE THESE WORDS THESE RIGHTS
THESE VALUES OF LIFE AND LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS REAL FOR
EVERY AMERICAN
BEING TRUE TO OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS DOES NOT REQUIRE
US TO AGREE ON EVERY CONTOUR OF LIFE
IT DOES NOT MEAN WE ALL DEFINE
LIBERTY IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY OR FOLLOW THE SAME PRECISE PATH TO
HAPPINESS
PROGRESS DOES NOT COMPEL US TO SETTLE CENTURIES LONG
DEBATES ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT FOR ALL TIME BUT IT DOES REQUIRE
US TO ACT IN OUR TIME
APPLAUSE
FOR NOW DECISIONS ARE UPON US AND WE CANNOT AFFORD DELAY
WE CANNOT
MISTAKE ABSOLUTISM FOR PRINCIPLE OR SUBSTITUTE SPECTACLE FOR POLITICS
OR TREAT NAME CALLING AS REASONED DEBATE
APPLAUSE WE MUST ACT
KNOWING THAT OUR WORK WILL BE IMPERFECT
WE MUST ACT KNOWING THAT
TODAYS VICTORIES WILL BE ONLY PARTIAL AND THAT IT WILL BE UP TO THOSE
WHO STAND HERE IN FOUR YEARS AND 40 YEARS AND 400 YEARS HENCE TO
ADVANCE THE TIMELESS SPIRIT ONCE CONFERRED TO US IN A SPARE
PHILADELPHIA HALL
MY FELLOW AMERICANS THE OATH I HAVE SWORN BEFORE YOU TODAY LIKE THE
ONE RECITED BY OTHERS WHO SERVE IN THIS CAPITOL WAS AN OATH TO GOD AND
COUNTRY NOT PARTY OR FACTION
AND WE MUST FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THAT
PLEDGE DURING THE DURATION OF OUR SERVICE
BUT THE WORDS I SPOKE TODAY
ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM THE OATH THAT IS TAKEN EACH TIME A SOLDIER
SIGNS UP FOR DUTY OR AN IMMIGRANT REALIZES HER DREAM
MY OATH IS NOT
SO DIFFERENT FROM THE PLEDGE WE ALL MAKE TO THE FLAG THAT WAVES ABOVE
AND THAT FILLS OUR HEARTS WITH PRIDE
THEY ARE THE WORDS OF CITIZENS AND THEY REPRESENT OUR GREATEST HOPE
YOU AND I AS CITIZENS HAVE THE POWER TO SET THIS COUNTRYS COURSE
YOU AND I AS CITIZENS HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO SHAPE THE DEBATES OF OUR
TIME NOT ONLY WITH THE VOTES WE CAST BUT WITH THE VOICES WE LIFT IN
DEFENSE OF OUR MOST ANCIENT VALUES AND ENDURING IDEALS
APPLAUSE
LET US EACH OF US NOW EMBRACE WITH SOLEMN DUTY AND AWESOME JOY WHAT
IS OUR LASTING BIRTHRIGHT
WITH COMMON EFFORT AND COMMON PURPOSE WITH
PASSION AND DEDICATION LET US ANSWER THE CALL OF HISTORY AND CARRY
INTO AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THAT PRECIOUS LIGHT OF FREEDOM
THANK YOU
GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY HE FOREVER BLESS THESE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA
APPLAUSE

ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS
BARACK OBAMA
FEBRUARY 24 2009
MADAM SPEAKER MR
VICE PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THE FIRST LADY
OF THE UNITED STATES SHE'S AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE I HAVE COME HERE
TONIGHT NOT ONLY TO ADDRESS THE DISTINGUISHED MEN AND WOMEN IN THIS
GREAT CHAMBER BUT TO SPEAK FRANKLY AND DIRECTLY TO THE MEN AND WOMEN
WHO SENT US HERE
I KNOW THAT FOR MANY AMERICANS WATCHING RIGHT NOW THE STATE OF OUR
ECONOMY IS A CONCERN THAT RISES ABOVE ALL OTHERS AND RIGHTLY SO
IF
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY THIS RECESSION YOU PROBABLY
KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS A FRIEND A NEIGHBOR A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY
YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR ANOTHER LIST OF STATISTICS TO KNOW THAT OUR
ECONOMY IS IN CRISIS BECAUSE YOU LIVE IT EVERY DAY
IT'S THE WORRY YOU
WAKE UP WITH AND THE SOURCE OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS
IT'S THE JOB YOU
THOUGHT YOU'D RETIRE FROM BUT NOW HAVE LOST THE BUSINESS YOU BUILT
YOUR DREAMS UPON THAT'S NOW HANGING BY A THREAD THE COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE
LETTER YOUR CHILD HAD TO PUT BACK IN THE ENVELOPE
THE IMPACT OF THIS
RECESSION IS REAL AND IT IS EVERYWHERE
BUT WHILE OUR ECONOMY MAY BE WEAKENED AND OUR CONFIDENCE SHAKEN THOUGH
WE ARE LIVING THROUGH DIFFICULT AND UNCERTAIN TIMES TONIGHT I WANT
EVERY AMERICAN TO KNOW THIS WE WILL REBUILD WE WILL RECOVER AND THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL EMERGE STRONGER THAN BEFORE
THE WEIGHT OF THIS CRISIS WILL NOT DETERMINE THE DESTINY OF THIS NATION
THE ANSWERS TO OUR PROBLEMS DON'T LIE BEYOND OUR REACH
THEY EXIST IN
OUR LABORATORIES AND OUR UNIVERSITIES IN OUR FIELDS AND OUR FACTORIES
IN THE IMAGINATIONS OF OUR ENTREPRENEURS AND THE PRIDE OF THE HARDEST
WORKING PEOPLE ON EARTH
THOSE QUALITIES THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA THE
GREATEST FORCE OF PROGRESS AND PROSPERITY IN HUMAN HISTORY WE STILL
POSSESS IN AMPLE MEASURE
WHAT IS REQUIRED NOW IS FOR THIS COUNTRY TO
PULL TOGETHER CONFRONT BOLDLY THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR FUTURE ONCE MORE
NOW IF WE'RE HONEST WITH OURSELVES WE'LL ADMIT THAT FOR TOO LONG WE
HAVE NOT ALWAYS MET THESE RESPONSIBILITIES AS A GOVERNMENT OR AS A
PEOPLE
I SAY THIS NOT TO LAY BLAME OR TO LOOK BACKWARDS BUT BECAUSE
IT IS ONLY BY UNDERSTANDING HOW WE ARRIVED AT THIS MOMENT THAT WE'LL BE
ABLE TO LIFT OURSELVES OUT OF THIS PREDICAMENT
THE FACT IS OUR ECONOMY DID NOT FALL INTO DECLINE OVERNIGHT NOR DID
ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS BEGIN WHEN THE HOUSING MARKET COLLAPSED OR THE
STOCK MARKET SANK
WE HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT OUR SURVIVAL DEPENDS
ON FINDING NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY YET WE IMPORT MORE OIL TODAY THAN
EVER BEFORE
THE COST OF HEALTH CARE EATS UP MORE AND MORE OF OUR
SAVINGS EACH YEAR YET WE KEEP DELAYING REFORM
OUR CHILDREN WILL
COMPETE FOR JOBS IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT TOO MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS DO
NOT PREPARE THEM FOR
AND THOUGH ALL THESE CHALLENGES WENT UNSOLVED WE
STILL MANAGED TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND PILE UP MORE DEBT BOTH AS
INDIVIDUALS AND THROUGH OUR GOVERNMENT THAN EVER BEFORE
IN OTHER WORDS WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH AN ERA WHERE TOO OFTEN SHORT TERM
GAINS WERE PRIZED OVER LONG TERM PROSPERITY WHERE WE FAILED TO LOOK
BEYOND THE NEXT PAYMENT THE NEXT QUARTER OR THE NEXT ELECTION
A
SURPLUS BECAME AN EXCUSE TO TRANSFER WEALTH TO THE WEALTHY INSTEAD OF
AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN OUR FUTURE
REGULATIONS WERE GUTTED FOR THE
SAKE OF A QUICK PROFIT AT THE EXPENSE OF A HEALTHY MARKET
PEOPLE
BOUGHT HOMES THEY KNEW THEY COULDN'T AFFORD FROM BANKS AND LENDERS WHO
PUSHED THOSE BAD LOANS ANYWAY
AND ALL THE WHILE CRITICAL DEBATES AND
DIFFICULT DECISIONS WERE PUT OFF FOR SOME OTHER TIME ON SOME OTHER DAY
WELL THAT DAY OF RECKONING HAS ARRIVED AND THE TIME TO TAKE CHARGE OF
OUR FUTURE IS HERE
NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT BOLDLY AND WISELY TO NOT ONLY REVIVE THIS
ECONOMY BUT TO BUILD A NEW FOUNDATION FOR LASTING PROSPERITY
NOW IS
THE TIME TO JUMP START JOB CREATION RESTART LENDING AND INVEST IN
AREAS LIKE ENERGY HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION THAT WILL GROW OUR
ECONOMY EVEN AS WE MAKE HARD CHOICES TO BRING OUR DEFICIT DOWN
THAT
IS WHAT MY ECONOMIC AGENDA IS DESIGNED TO DO AND THAT IS WHAT I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT
IT'S AN AGENDA THAT BEGINS WITH JOBS
AS SOON AS I TOOK OFFICE I ASKED THIS CONGRESS TO SEND ME A RECOVERY
PLAN BY PRESIDENT'S DAY THAT WOULD PUT PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND PUT
MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS NOT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN BIGGER GOVERNMENT I
DON'T NOT BECAUSE I'M NOT MINDFUL OF THE MASSIVE DEBT WE'VE INHERITED
I AM
I CALLED FOR ACTION BECAUSE THE FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE COST
MORE JOBS AND CAUSED MORE HARDSHIP
IN FACT A FAILURE TO ACT WOULD
HAVE WORSENED OUR LONG TERM DEFICIT BY ASSURING WEAK ECONOMIC GROWTH
FOR YEARS
AND THAT'S WHY I PUSHED FOR QUICK ACTION
AND TONIGHT I AM
GRATEFUL THAT THIS CONGRESS DELIVERED AND PLEASED TO SAY THAT THE
AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT IS NOW LAW
OVER THE NEXT 2 YEARS THIS PLAN WILL SAVE OR CREATE 3 5 MILLION JOBS
MORE THAN 90 PERCENT OF THESE JOBS WILL BE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS
REBUILDING OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES CONSTRUCTING WIND TURBINES AND SOLAR
PANELS LAYING BROADBAND AND EXPANDING MASS TRANSIT
BECAUSE OF THIS PLAN THERE ARE TEACHERS WHO CAN NOW KEEP THEIR JOBS
AND EDUCATE OUR KIDS HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS CAN CONTINUE CARING FOR
OUR SICK
THERE ARE 57 POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE STILL ON THE STREETS OF
MINNEAPOLIS TONIGHT BECAUSE THIS PLAN PREVENTED THE LAYOFFS THEIR
DEPARTMENT WAS ABOUT TO MAKE
BECAUSE OF THIS PLAN 95 PERCENT OF
WORKING HOUSEHOLDS IN AMERICA WILL RECEIVE A TAX CUT A TAX CUT THAT
YOU WILL SEE IN YOUR PAYCHECKS BEGINNING ON APRIL 1ST
BECAUSE OF THIS
PLAN FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY TUITION COSTS WILL RECEIVE A
2 500 TAX CREDIT FOR ALL 4 YEARS OF COLLEGE AND AMERICANS WHO HAVE
LOST THEIR JOBS IN THIS RECESSION WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE EXTENDED
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND CONTINUED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO HELP THEM
WEATHER THIS STORM
NOW I KNOW THERE ARE SOME IN THIS CHAMBER AND WATCHING AT HOME WHO ARE
SKEPTICAL OF WHETHER THIS PLAN WILL WORK AND I UNDERSTAND THAT
SKEPTICISM
HERE IN WASHINGTON WE'VE ALL SEEN HOW QUICKLY GOOD
INTENTIONS CAN TURN INTO BROKEN PROMISES AND WASTEFUL SPENDING
AND
WITH A PLAN OF THIS SCALE COMES ENORMOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO GET IT RIGHT
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE ASKED VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TO LEAD A TOUGH
UNPRECEDENTED OVERSIGHT EFFORT BECAUSE NOBODY MESSES WITH JOE
I AM I
RIGHT THEY DON'T MESS WITH HIM
I HAVE TOLD EACH OF MY CABINET AS
WELL AS MAYORS AND GOVERNORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT THEY WILL BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE BY ME AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND
I'VE APPOINTED A PROVEN AND AGGRESSIVE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO FERRET OUT
ANY AND ALL CASES OF WASTE AND FRAUD
AND WE HAVE CREATED A NEW WEB
SITE CALLED RECOVERY GOV SO THAT EVERY AMERICAN CAN FIND OUT HOW AND
WHERE THEIR MONEY IS BEING SPENT
SO THE RECOVERY PLAN WE PASSED IS THE FIRST STEP IN GETTING OUR ECONOMY
BACK ON TRACK
BUT IT IS JUST THE FIRST STEP
BECAUSE EVEN IF WE MANAGE
THIS PLAN FLAWLESSLY THERE WILL BE NO REAL RECOVERY UNLESS WE CLEAN UP
THE CREDIT CRISIS THAT HAS SEVERELY WEAKENED OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM
I WANT TO SPEAK PLAINLY AND CANDIDLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE TONIGHT BECAUSE
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW THAT IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY'S WELL BEING
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT THE MONEY YOU'VE
DEPOSITED IN BANKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS SAFE YOUR INSURANCE IS SECURE
YOU CAN RELY ON THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM
THAT'S
NOT THE SOURCE OF CONCERN
THE CONCERN IS THAT IF WE DO NOT RESTART
LENDING IN THIS COUNTRY OUR RECOVERY WILL BE CHOKED OFF BEFORE IT EVEN
BEGINS
YOU SEE THE FLOW OF CREDIT IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY
THE
ABILITY TO GET A LOAN IS HOW YOU FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF EVERYTHING
FROM A HOME TO A CAR TO A COLLEGE EDUCATION HOW STORES STOCK THEIR
SHELVES FARMS BUY EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES MAKE PAYROLL
BUT CREDIT HAS STOPPED FLOWING THE WAY IT SHOULD
TOO MANY BAD LOANS
FROM THE HOUSING CRISIS HAVE MADE THEIR WAY ONTO THE BOOKS OF TOO MANY
BANKS
AND WITH SO MUCH DEBT AND SO LITTLE CONFIDENCE THESE BANKS ARE
NOW FEARFUL OF LENDING OUT ANY MORE MONEY TO HOUSEHOLDS TO BUSINESSES
OR EVEN TO EACH OTHER
AND WHEN THERE IS NO LENDING FAMILIES CAN'T
AFFORD TO BUY HOMES OR CARS SO BUSINESSES ARE FORCED TO MAKE LAYOFFS
OUR ECONOMY SUFFERS EVEN MORE AND CREDIT DRIES UP EVEN FURTHER
THAT
IS WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING SWIFTLY AND AGGRESSIVELY TO BREAK
THIS DESTRUCTIVE CYCLE TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND RESTART LENDING
AND
WE WILL DO SO IN SEVERAL WAYS
FIRST WE ARE CREATING A NEW LENDING FUND THAT REPRESENTS THE LARGEST
EFFORT EVER TO HELP PROVIDE AUTO LOANS COLLEGE LOANS AND SMALL
BUSINESS LOANS TO THE CONSUMERS AND ENTREPRENEURS WHO KEEP THIS ECONOMY
RUNNING
SECOND WE HAVE LAUNCHED A HOUSING PLAN THAT WILL HELP RESPONSIBLE
FAMILIES FACING THE THREAT OF FORECLOSURE LOWER THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENTS
AND REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGES
IT'S A PLAN THAT WON'T HELP SPECULATORS
OR THAT NEIGHBOR DOWN THE STREET WHO BOUGHT A HOUSE HE COULD NEVER HOPE
TO AFFORD BUT IT WILL HELP MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING
WITH DECLINING HOME VALUES AMERICANS WHO WILL NOW BE ABLE TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER INTEREST RATES THAT THIS PLAN HAS ALREADY HELPED
TO BRING ABOUT
IN FACT THE AVERAGE FAMILY WHO REFINANCES TODAY CAN
SAVE NEARLY 2 000 PER YEAR ON THEIR MORTGAGE
THIRD WE WILL ACT WITH THE FULL FORCE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO
ENSURE THAT THE MAJOR BANKS THAT AMERICANS DEPEND ON HAVE ENOUGH
CONFIDENCE AND ENOUGH MONEY TO LEND EVEN IN MORE DIFFICULT TIMES
AND
WHEN WE LEARN THAT A MAJOR BANK HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WE WILL HOLD
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE RESPONSIBLE FORCE THE NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDE
THE SUPPORT TO CLEAN UP THEIR BALANCE SHEETS AND ASSURE THE CONTINUITY
OF A STRONG VIABLE INSTITUTION THAT CAN SERVE OUR PEOPLE AND OUR
ECONOMY
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT ON ANY GIVEN DAY WALL STREET MAY BE MORE
COMFORTED BY AN APPROACH THAT GIVES BANK BAILOUTS WITH NO STRINGS
ATTACHED AND THAT HOLDS NOBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR RECKLESS DECISIONS
BUT SUCH AN APPROACH WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND OUR GOAL IS TO
QUICKEN THE DAY WHEN WE RESTART LENDING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND
AMERICAN BUSINESS AND END THIS CRISIS ONCE AND FOR ALL
AND I INTEND TO HOLD THESE BANKS FULLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ASSISTANCE
THEY RECEIVE AND THIS TIME THEY WILL HAVE TO CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE HOW
TAXPAYER DOLLARS RESULT IN MORE LENDING FOR THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER
THIS
TIME CEOS WON'T BE ABLE TO USE TAXPAYER MONEY TO PAD THEIR PAYCHECKS
OR BUY FANCY DRAPES OR DISAPPEAR ON A PRIVATE JET
THOSE DAYS ARE OVER
STILL THIS PLAN WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND YES PROBABLY MORE THAN WE'VE ALREADY SET ASIDE
BUT
WHILE THE COST OF ACTION WILL BE GREAT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE COST
OF INACTION WILL BE FAR GREATER FOR IT COULD RESULT IN AN ECONOMY THAT
SPUTTERS ALONG FOR NOT MONTHS OR YEARS BUT PERHAPS A DECADE
THAT
WOULD BE WORSE FOR OUR DEFICIT WORSE FOR BUSINESS WORSE FOR YOU AND
WORSE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
AND I REFUSE TO LET THAT HAPPEN
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION ASKED THIS CONGRESS
TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR STRUGGLING BANKS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
ALIKE WERE INFURIATED BY THE MISMANAGEMENT AND THE RESULTS THAT
FOLLOWED
SO WERE THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS SO WAS I
SO I KNOW HOW
UNPOPULAR IT IS TO BE SEEN AS HELPING BANKS RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY WHEN
EVERYONE IS SUFFERING IN PART FROM THEIR BAD DECISIONS
I PROMISE YOU
I GET IT
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IN A TIME OF CRISIS WE CANNOT AFFORD TO GOVERN
OUT OF ANGER OR YIELD TO THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT
MY JOB OUR JOB IS
TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OUR JOB IS TO GOVERN WITH A SENSE OF
RESPONSIBILITY
I WILL NOT SEND I WILL NOT SPEND A SINGLE PENNY FOR
THE PURPOSE OF REWARDING A SINGLE WALL STREET EXECUTIVE BUT I WILL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HELP THE SMALL BUSINESS THAT CAN'T PAY ITS WORKERS
OR THE FAMILY THAT HAS SAVED AND STILL CAN'T GET A MORTGAGE
THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT
IT'S NOT ABOUT HELPING BANKS IT'S ABOUT HELPING
PEOPLE
APPLAUSE
IT'S NOT ABOUT HELPING BANKS IT'S ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE
BECAUSE WHEN
CREDIT IS AVAILABLE AGAIN THAT YOUNG FAMILY CAN FINALLY BUY A NEW HOME
AND THEN SOME COMPANY WILL HIRE WORKERS TO BUILD IT
AND THEN THOSE
WORKERS WILL HAVE MONEY TO SPEND
AND IF THEY CAN GET A LOAN TOO MAYBE
THEY'LL FINALLY BUY THAT CAR OR OPEN THEIR OWN BUSINESS
INVESTORS WILL
RETURN TO THE MARKET AND AMERICAN FAMILIES WILL SEE THEIR RETIREMENT
SECURED ONCE MORE
SLOWLY BUT SURELY CONFIDENCE WILL RETURN AND OUR
ECONOMY WILL RECOVER
SO I ASK THIS CONGRESS TO JOIN ME IN DOING WHATEVER PROVES NECESSARY
BECAUSE WE CANNOT CONSIGN OUR NATION TO AN OPEN ENDED RECESSION
AND TO
ENSURE THAT A CRISIS OF THIS MAGNITUDE NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN I ASK
CONGRESS TO MOVE QUICKLY ON LEGISLATION THAT WILL FINALLY REFORM OUR
OUTDATED REGULATORY SYSTEM
IT IS TIME TO PUT IN PLACE TOUGH NEW
COMMONSENSE RULES OF THE ROAD SO THAT OUR FINANCIAL MARKET REWARDS
DRIVE AND INNOVATION AND PUNISHES SHORTCUTS AND ABUSE
THE RECOVERY PLAN AND THE FINANCIAL STABILITY PLAN ARE THE IMMEDIATE
STEPS WE'RE TAKING TO REVIVE OUR ECONOMY IN THE SHORT TERM
BUT THE
ONLY WAY TO FULLY RESTORE AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH IS TO MAKE THE
LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WILL LEAD TO NEW JOBS NEW INDUSTRIES AND A
RENEWED ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD
THE ONLY WAY
THIS CENTURY WILL BE ANOTHER AMERICAN CENTURY IS IF WE CONFRONT AT LAST
THE PRICE OF OUR DEPENDENCE ON OIL AND THE HIGH COST OF HEALTH CARE
THE SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T PREPARING OUR CHILDREN AND THE MOUNTAIN OF DEBT
THEY STAND TO INHERIT
THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY
IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS I WILL SUBMIT A BUDGET TO CONGRESS
SO OFTEN
WE'VE COME TO VIEW THESE DOCUMENTS AS SIMPLY NUMBERS ON A PAGE OR A
LAUNDRY LIST OF PROGRAMS
I SEE THIS DOCUMENT DIFFERENTLY
I SEE IT AS
A VISION FOR AMERICA AS A BLUEPRINT FOR OUR FUTURE
MY BUDGET DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM OR ADDRESS EVERY
ISSUE
IT REFLECTS THE STARK REALITY OF WHAT WE'VE INHERITED A
TRILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT A FINANCIAL CRISIS AND A COSTLY RECESSION
GIVEN THESE REALITIES EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO SACRIFICE SOME WORTHY PRIORITIES FOR WHICH
THERE ARE NO DOLLARS
AND THAT INCLUDES ME
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE
CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE OUR LONG TERM CHALLENGES
I REJECT THE VIEW THAT
SAYS OUR PROBLEMS WILL SIMPLY TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THAT SAYS
GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE IN LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR COMMON
PROSPERITY
FOR HISTORY TELLS A DIFFERENT STORY
HISTORY REMINDS US THAT AT EVERY
MOMENT OF ECONOMIC UPHEAVAL AND TRANSFORMATION THIS NATION HAS
RESPONDED WITH BOLD ACTION AND BIG IDEAS
IN THE MIDST OF CIVIL WAR WE
LAID RAILROAD TRACKS FROM ONE COAST TO ANOTHER THAT SPURRED COMMERCE
AND INDUSTRY
FROM THE TURMOIL OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION CAME A
SYSTEM OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS THAT PREPARED OUR CITIZENS FOR A NEW AGE
IN THE WAKE OF WAR AND DEPRESSION THE GI BILL SENT A GENERATION TO
COLLEGE AND CREATED THE LARGEST MIDDLE CLASS IN HISTORY
AND A TWILIGHT
STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM LED TO A NATION OF HIGHWAYS AN AMERICAN ON THE
MOON AND AN EXPLOSION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT STILL SHAPES OUR WORLD
IN
EACH CASE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T SUPPLANT PRIVATE ENTERPRISE IT CATALYZED
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE
IT CREATED THE CONDITIONS FOR THOUSANDS OF
ENTREPRENEURS AND NEW BUSINESSES TO ADAPT AND TO THRIVE
WE ARE A NATION THAT HAS SEEN PROMISE AMID PERIL AND CLAIMED
OPPORTUNITY FROM ORDEAL
NOW WE MUST BE THAT NATION AGAIN AND THAT IS
WHY EVEN AS IT CUTS BACK ON PROGRAMS WE DON'T NEED THE BUDGET I
SUBMIT WILL INVEST IN THE THREE AREAS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO
OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE ENERGY HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION
IT BEGINS WITH ENERGY
WE KNOW THE COUNTRY THAT HARNESSES THE POWER OF
CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY WILL LEAD THE 21ST CENTURY
AND YET IT IS
CHINA THAT HAS LAUNCHED THE LARGEST EFFORT IN HISTORY TO MAKE THEIR
ECONOMY ENERGY EFFICIENT
WE INVENTED SOLAR TECHNOLOGY BUT WE'VE
FALLEN BEHIND COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY AND JAPAN IN PRODUCING IT
NEW
PLUG IN HYBRIDS ROLL OFF OUR ASSEMBLY LINES BUT THEY WILL RUN ON
BATTERIES MADE IN KOREA
WELL I DO NOT ACCEPT A FUTURE WHERE THE JOBS
AND INDUSTRIES OF TOMORROW TAKE ROOT BEYOND OUR BORDERS AND I KNOW YOU
DON'T EITHER
IT IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO LEAD AGAIN
THANKS TO OUR RECOVERY PLAN WE WILL DOUBLE THIS NATION'S SUPPLY OF
RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE NEXT 3 YEARS
WE'VE ALSO MADE THE LARGEST
INVESTMENT IN BASIC RESEARCH FUNDING IN AMERICAN HISTORY AN INVESTMENT
THAT WILL SPUR NOT ONLY NEW DISCOVERIES IN ENERGY BUT BREAKTHROUGHS IN
MEDICINE AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
WE WILL SOON LAY DOWN THOUSANDS OF MILES OF POWER LINES THAT CAN CARRY
NEW ENERGY TO CITIES AND TOWNS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY
AND WE WILL PUT
AMERICANS TO WORK MAKING OUR HOMES AND BUILDINGS MORE EFFICIENT SO THAT
WE CAN SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON OUR ENERGY BILLS
BUT TO TRULY TRANSFORM OUR ECONOMY TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY AND SAVE
OUR PLANET FROM THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE NEED TO ULTIMATELY
MAKE CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY THE PROFITABLE KIND OF ENERGY
SO I ASK
THIS CONGRESS TO SEND ME LEGISLATION THAT PLACES A MARKET BASED CAP ON
CARBON POLLUTION AND DRIVES THE PRODUCTION OF MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY IN
AMERICA
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
AND TO SUPPORT THAT INNOVATION WE WILL
INVEST 15 BILLION A YEAR TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES LIKE WIND POWER AND
SOLAR POWER ADVANCED BIOFUELS CLEAN COAL AND MORE EFFICIENT CARS AND
TRUCKS BUILT RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA
SPEAKING OF OUR AUTO INDUSTRY EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THAT YEARS OF BAD
DECISIONMAKING AND A GLOBAL RECESSION HAVE PUSHED OUR AUTOMAKERS TO THE
BRINK
WE SHOULD NOT AND WILL NOT PROTECT THEM FROM THEIR OWN BAD
PRACTICES
BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE GOAL OF A RETOOLED REIMAGINED
AUTO INDUSTRY THAT CAN COMPETE AND WIN
MILLIONS OF JOBS DEPEND ON IT
SCORES OF COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON IT
AND I BELIEVE THE NATION THAT
INVENTED THE AUTOMOBILE CANNOT WALK AWAY FROM IT
NOW NONE OF THIS WILL COME WITHOUT COST NOR WILL IT BE EASY
BUT THIS
IS AMERICA
WE DON'T DO WHAT'S EASY
WE DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO MOVE
THIS COUNTRY FORWARD
AND FOR THAT SAME REASON WE MUST ALSO ADDRESS THE CRUSHING COST OF
HEALTH CARE
THIS IS A COST THAT NOW CAUSES A BANKRUPTCY IN AMERICA
EVERY 30 SECONDS
BY THE END OF THE YEAR IT COULD CAUSE 1 5 MILLION
AMERICANS TO LOSE THEIR HOMES
IN THE LAST 8 YEARS PREMIUMS HAVE GROWN
FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN WAGES
AND IN EACH OF THESE YEARS 1 MILLION
MORE AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE
IT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR
REASONS WHY SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSE THEIR DOORS AND CORPORATIONS SHIP
JOBS OVERSEAS
AND IT'S ONE OF THE LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING PARTS OF
OUR BUDGET
GIVEN THESE FACTS WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO PUT HEALTH
CARE REFORM ON HOLD
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO DO IT
IT'S TIME
ALREADY WE'VE DONE MORE TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF HEALTH CARE REFORM IN
THE LAST 30 DAYS THAN WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST DECADE
WHEN IT WAS DAYS
OLD THIS CONGRESS PASSED A LAW TO PROVIDE AND PROTECT HEALTH INSURANCE
FOR 11 MILLION AMERICAN CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS WORK FULL TIME
OUR
RECOVERY PLAN WILL INVEST IN ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS A NEW
TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL REDUCE ERRORS BRING DOWN COSTS ENSURE PRIVACY
AND SAVE LIVES
IT WILL LAUNCH A NEW EFFORT TO CONQUER A DISEASE THAT
HAS TOUCHED THE LIFE OF NEARLY EVERY AMERICAN INCLUDING ME BY SEEKING
A CURE FOR CANCER IN OUR TIME
AND IT MAKES THE LARGEST INVESTMENT EVER
IN PREVENTIVE CARE BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO KEEP OUR
PEOPLE HEALTHY AND OUR COSTS UNDER CONTROL
THIS BUDGET BUILDS ON THESE REFORMS
IT INCLUDES A HISTORIC COMMITMENT
TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE REFORM A DOWN PAYMENT ON THE PRINCIPLE
THAT WE MUST HAVE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN
IT'S A COMMITMENT THAT'S PAID FOR IN PART BY EFFICIENCIES IN OUR SYSTEM
THAT ARE LONG OVERDUE
AND IT'S A STEP WE MUST TAKE IF WE HOPE TO BRING
DOWN OUR DEFICIT IN THE YEARS TO COME
NOW THERE WILL BE MANY DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO
ACHIEVE REFORM AND THAT'S WHY I'M BRINGING TOGETHER BUSINESSES AND
WORKERS DOCTORS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
TO BEGIN WORK ON THIS ISSUE NEXT WEEK
I SUFFER NO ILLUSIONS THAT THIS WILL BE AN EASY PROCESS
ONCE AGAIN IT
WILL BE HARD
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT NEARLY A CENTURY AFTER TEDDY
ROOSEVELT FIRST CALLED FOR REFORM THE COST OF OUR HEALTH CARE HAS
WEIGHED DOWN OUR ECONOMY AND OUR CONSCIENCE LONG ENOUGH
SO LET THERE
BE NO DOUBT HEALTH CARE REFORM CANNOT WAIT IT MUST NOT WAIT AND IT
WILL NOT WAIT ANOTHER YEAR
THE THIRD CHALLENGE WE MUST ADDRESS IS THE URGENT NEED TO EXPAND THE
PROMISE OF EDUCATION IN AMERICA
IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY WHERE THE MOST
VALUABLE SKILL YOU CAN SELL IS YOUR KNOWLEDGE A GOOD EDUCATION IS NO
LONGER JUST A PATHWAY TO OPPORTUNITY IT IS A PREREQUISITE
RIGHT NOW
THREE QUARTERS OF THE FASTEST GROWING OCCUPATIONS REQUIRE MORE THAN A
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA
AND YET JUST OVER HALF OF OUR CITIZENS HAVE THAT
LEVEL OF EDUCATION
WE HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT
RATES OF ANY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION AND HALF OF THE STUDENTS WHO BEGIN
COLLEGE NEVER FINISH
THIS IS A PRESCRIPTION FOR ECONOMIC DECLINE BECAUSE WE KNOW THE
COUNTRIES THAT OUT TEACH US TODAY WILL OUTCOMPETE US TOMORROW
THAT IS
WHY IT WILL BE THE GOAL OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT EVERY
CHILD HAS ACCESS TO A COMPLETE AND COMPETITIVE EDUCATION FROM THE DAY
THEY ARE BORN TO THE DAY THEY BEGIN A CAREER
THAT IS A PROMISE WE HAVE
TO MAKE TO THE CHILDREN OF AMERICA
ALREADY WE'VE MADE HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION THROUGH THE
ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN
WE'VE DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED EARLY CHILDHOOD
EDUCATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ITS QUALITY BECAUSE WE KNOW
THAT THE MOST FORMATIVE LEARNING COMES IN THOSE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE
WE'VE MADE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR NEARLY 7 MILLION MORE STUDENTS 7
MILLION
AND WE HAVE PROVIDED THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PREVENT
PAINFUL CUTS AND TEACHER LAYOFFS THAT WOULD SET BACK OUR CHILDREN'S
PROGRESS
BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOLS DON'T JUST NEED MORE RESOURCES THEY NEED
MORE REFORM
AND THAT IS WHY THIS BUDGET CREATES NEW TEACHERS NEW
INCENTIVES FOR TEACHER PERFORMANCE PATHWAYS FOR ADVANCEMENT AND
REWARDS FOR SUCCESS
WE'LL INVEST IN INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE
ALREADY HELPING SCHOOLS MEET HIGH STANDARDS AND CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS
AND WE WILL EXPAND OUR COMMITMENT TO CHARTER SCHOOLS
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS LAWMAKERS AND AS EDUCATORS TO MAKE THIS
SYSTEM WORK
BUT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY CITIZEN TO
PARTICIPATE IN IT
SO TONIGHT I ASK EVERY AMERICAN TO COMMIT TO AT
LEAST 1 YEAR OR MORE OF HIGHER EDUCATION OR CAREER TRAINING
THIS CAN
BE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A 4 YEAR SCHOOL VOCATIONAL TRAINING OR AN
APPRENTICESHIP
BUT WHATEVER THE TRAINING MAY BE EVERY AMERICAN WILL
NEED TO GET MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA
AND DROPPING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IS NO LONGER AN OPTION
IT'S NOT JUST
QUITTING ON YOURSELF IT'S QUITTING ON YOUR COUNTRY AND THIS COUNTRY
NEEDS AND VALUES THE TALENTS OF EVERY AMERICAN
THAT'S WHY WE WILL
SUPPORT WE WILL PROVIDE THE SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR ALL YOUNG AMERICANS
TO COMPLETE COLLEGE AND MEET A NEW GOAL
BY 2020 AMERICA WILL ONCE
AGAIN HAVE THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF COLLEGE GRADUATES IN THE WORLD
THAT IS A GOAL WE CAN MEET
THAT'S A GOAL WE CAN MEET
NOW I KNOW THAT THE PRICE OF TUITION IS HIGHER THAN EVER WHICH IS WHY
IF YOU ARE WILLING TO VOLUNTEER IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR GIVE BACK TO
YOUR COMMUNITY OR SERVE YOUR COUNTRY WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN
AFFORD A HIGHER EDUCATION
AND TO ENCOURAGE A RENEWED SPIRIT OF
NATIONAL SERVICE FOR THIS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS I ASK CONGRESS TO
SEND ME THE BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION THAT BEARS THE NAME OF SENATOR ORRIN
HATCH AS WELL AS AN AMERICAN WHO HAS NEVER STOPPED ASKING WHAT HE CAN
DO FOR HIS COUNTRY SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY
THESE EDUCATION POLICIES WILL OPEN THE DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR
CHILDREN BUT IT IS UP TO US TO ENSURE THEY WALK THROUGH THEM
IN THE
END THERE IS NO PROGRAM OR POLICY THAT CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR A PARENT
FOR A MOTHER OR FATHER WHO WILL ATTEND THOSE PARENT TEACHER CONFERENCES
OR HELP WITH HOMEWORK OR TURN OFF THE TV PUT AWAY THE VIDEO GAMES
READ TO THEIR CHILD
I SPEAK TO YOU NOT JUST AS A PRESIDENT BUT AS A
FATHER WHEN I SAY THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION
MUST BEGIN AT HOME
THAT IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC ISSUE OR A REPUBLICAN
ISSUE THAT'S AN AMERICAN ISSUE
THERE IS OF COURSE ANOTHER RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE TO OUR CHILDREN
AND THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT PASS ON TO THEM
A DEBT THEY CANNOT PAY
THAT IS CRITICAL
APPLAUSE I AGREE
ABSOLUTELY
SEE I KNOW WE CAN GET SOME CONSENSUS IN HERE
LAUGHTER
WITH THE DEFICIT WE INHERITED THE COST OF THE CRISIS WE FACE AND THE
LONG TERM CHALLENGES WE MUST MEET IT HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT TO
ENSURE THAT AS OUR ECONOMY RECOVERS WE DO WHAT IT TAKES TO BRING THIS
DEFICIT DOWN
THAT IS CRITICAL
NOW I'M PROUD THAT WE PASSED A RECOVERY PLAN FREE OF EARMARKS AND I
WANT TO PASS A BUDGET NEXT YEAR THAT ENSURES THAT EACH DOLLAR WE SPEND
REFLECTS ONLY OUR MOST IMPORTANT NATIONAL PRIORITIES
AND YESTERDAY I HELD A FISCAL SUMMIT WHERE I PLEDGED TO CUT THE DEFICIT
IN HALF BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM IN OFFICE
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS
ALSO BEGUN TO GO LINE BY LINE THROUGH THE FEDERAL BUDGET IN ORDER TO
ELIMINATE WASTEFUL AND INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS
IS A PROCESS THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME
BUT WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED
2 TRILLION IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT DECADE
IN THIS BUDGET WE WILL END EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT DON'T WORK AND END
DIRECT PAYMENTS TO LARGE AGRIBUSINESS THAT DON'T NEED THEM
WE'LL
ELIMINATE THE NO BID CONTRACTS THAT HAVE WASTED BILLIONS IN IRAQ AND
REFORM OUR DEFENSE BUDGET SO THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR COLD WAR ERA
WEAPONS SYSTEMS WE DON'T USE
WE WILL ROOT OUT THE WASTE AND FRAUD AND
ABUSE IN OUR MEDICARE PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T MAKE OUR SENIORS ANY
HEALTHIER
WE WILL RESTORE A SENSE OF FAIRNESS AND BALANCE TO OUR TAX
CODE BY FINALLY ENDING THE TAX BREAKS FOR CORPORATIONS THAT SHIP OUR
JOBS OVERSEAS
IN ORDER TO SAVE OUR CHILDREN FROM A FUTURE OF DEBT WE WILL ALSO END
THE TAX BREAKS FOR THE WEALTHIEST 2 PERCENT OF AMERICANS
NOW LET ME
BE CLEAR LET ME BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'LL END UP
HEARING SOME OF THE SAME CLAIMS THAT ROLLING BACK THESE TAX BREAKS
MEANS A MASSIVE TAX INCREASE ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IF YOUR FAMILY
EARNS LESS THAN 250 000 A YEAR A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR YOU
WILL NOT SEE YOUR TAXES INCREASED A SINGLE DIME
I REPEAT NOT ONE
SINGLE DIME
IN FACT NOT A DIME IN FACT THE RECOVERY PLAN PROVIDES A
TAX CUT THAT'S RIGHT A TAX CUT FOR 95 PERCENT OF WORKING FAMILIES
AND BY THE WAY THESE CHECKS ARE ON THE WAY
NOW TO PRESERVE OUR LONG TERM FISCAL HEALTH WE MUST ALSO ADDRESS THE
GROWING COSTS IN MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY
COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH
CARE REFORM IS THE BEST WAY TO STRENGTHEN MEDICARE FOR YEARS TO COME
AND WE MUST ALSO BEGIN A CONVERSATION ON HOW TO DO THE SAME FOR SOCIAL
SECURITY WHILE CREATING TAX FREE UNIVERSAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR ALL
AMERICANS
FINALLY BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO SUFFERING FROM A DEFICIT OF TRUST I AM
COMMITTED TO RESTORING A SENSE OF HONESTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR
BUDGET
THAT IS WHY THIS BUDGET LOOKS AHEAD 10 YEARS AND ACCOUNTS FOR
SPENDING THAT WAS LEFT OUT UNDER THE OLD RULES
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
THAT INCLUDES THE FULL COST OF FIGHTING IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
FOR 7
YEARS WE HAVE BEEN A NATION AT WAR
NO LONGER WILL WE HIDE ITS PRICE
ALONG WITH OUR OUTSTANDING NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM I'M NOW CAREFULLY
REVIEWING OUR POLICIES IN BOTH WARS AND I WILL SOON ANNOUNCE A WAY
FORWARD IN IRAQ THAT LEAVES IRAQ TO ITS PEOPLE AND RESPONSIBLY ENDS
THIS WAR
AND WITH OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES WE WILL FORGE A NEW AND COMPREHENSIVE
STRATEGY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN TO DEFEAT AL QAIDA AND COMBAT
EXTREMISM BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW TERRORISTS TO PLOT AGAINST THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM SAFE HAVENS HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD
WE WILL NOT
ALLOW IT
AS WE MEET HERE TONIGHT OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM STAND WATCH
ABROAD AND MORE ARE READYING TO DEPLOY
TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM
AND TO THE FAMILIES WHO BEAR THE QUIET BURDEN OF THEIR ABSENCE
AMERICANS ARE UNITED IN SENDING ONE MESSAGE WE HONOR YOUR SERVICE WE
ARE INSPIRED BY YOUR SACRIFICE AND YOU HAVE OUR UNYIELDING SUPPORT
TO RELIEVE THE STRAIN ON OUR FORCES MY BUDGET INCREASES THE NUMBER OF
OUR SOLDIERS AND MARINES
AND TO KEEP OUR SACRED TRUST WITH THOSE WHO
SERVE WE WILL RAISE THEIR PAY AND GIVE OUR VETERANS THE EXPANDED
HEALTH CARE AND BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE EARNED
TO OVERCOME EXTREMISM WE MUST ALSO BE VIGILANT IN UPHOLDING THE VALUES
OUR TROOPS DEFEND BECAUSE THERE IS NO FORCE IN THE WORLD MORE POWERFUL
THAN THE EXAMPLE OF AMERICA
AND THAT IS WHY I HAVE ORDERED THE CLOSING
OF THE DETENTION CENTER AT GUANTANAMO BAY AND WILL SEEK SWIFT AND
CERTAIN JUSTICE FOR CAPTURED TERRORISTS
BECAUSE LIVING OUR VALUES
DOESN'T MAKE US WEAKER IT MAKES US SAFER AND IT MAKES US STRONGER
AND
THAT IS WHY I CAN STAND HERE TONIGHT AND SAY WITHOUT EXCEPTION OR
EQUIVOCATION THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DOES NOT TORTURE
WE CAN
MAKE THAT COMMITMENT HERE TONIGHT
IN WORDS AND DEEDS WE ARE SHOWING THE WORLD THAT A NEW ERA OF
ENGAGEMENT HAS BEGUN
FOR WE KNOW THAT AMERICA CANNOT MEET THE THREATS
OF THIS CENTURY ALONE BUT THE WORLD CANNOT MEET THEM WITHOUT AMERICA
WE CANNOT SHUN THE NEGOTIATING TABLE NOR IGNORE THE FOES OR FORCES
THAT COULD DO US HARM
WE ARE INSTEAD CALLED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE
SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AND CANDOR THAT SERIOUS TIMES DEMAND
TO SEEK PROGRESS TOWARDS A SECURE AND LASTING PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
HER NEIGHBORS WE HAVE APPOINTED AN ENVOY TO SUSTAIN OUR EFFORT
TO
MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE 21ST CENTURY FROM TERRORISM TO NUCLEAR
PROLIFERATION FROM PANDEMIC DISEASE TO CYBER THREATS TO CRUSHING
POVERTY WE WILL STRENGTHEN OLD ALLIANCES FORGE NEW ONES AND USE ALL
ELEMENTS OF OUR NATIONAL POWER
AND TO RESPOND TO AN ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT IS GLOBAL IN SCOPE WE ARE
WORKING WITH THE NATIONS OF THE G 20 TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR
FINANCIAL SYSTEM AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF ESCALATING PROTECTIONISM
AND SPUR DEMAND FOR AMERICAN GOODS IN MARKETS ACROSS THE GLOBE
FOR THE
WORLD DEPENDS ON US HAVING A STRONG ECONOMY JUST AS OUR ECONOMY
DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE WORLD'S
AS WE STAND AT THIS CROSSROADS OF HISTORY THE EYES OF ALL PEOPLE IN
ALL NATIONS ARE ONCE AGAIN UPON US WATCHING TO SEE WHAT WE DO WITH
THIS MOMENT WAITING FOR US TO LEAD
THOSE OF US GATHERED HERE TONIGHT
HAVE BEEN CALLED TO GOVERN IN EXTRAORDINARY TIMES
IT IS A TREMENDOUS
BURDEN BUT ALSO A GREAT PRIVILEGE ONE THAT HAS BEEN ENTRUSTED TO FEW
GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS
FOR IN OUR HANDS LIES THE ABILITY TO SHAPE
OUR WORLD FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL
I KNOW THAT IT'S EASY TO LOSE SIGHT OF THIS TRUTH TO BECOME CYNICAL
AND DOUBTFUL CONSUMED WITH THE PETTY AND THE TRIVIAL
BUT IN MY LIFE
I HAVE ALSO LEARNED THAT HOPE IS FOUND IN UNLIKELY PLACES THAT
INSPIRATION OFTEN COMES NOT FROM THOSE WITH THE MOST POWER OR CELEBRITY
BUT FROM THE DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS OF ORDINARY AMERICANS WHO ARE
ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY
I THINK OF LEONARD ABESS A BANK PRESIDENT FROM MIAMI WHO REPORTEDLY
CASHED OUT OF HIS COMPANY TOOK A 60 MILLION BONUS AND GAVE IT OUT TO
ALL 399 PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR HIM PLUS ANOTHER 72 WHO USED TO WORK FOR
HIM
HE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE BUT WHEN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER FOUND OUT HE
SIMPLY SAID I KNEW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE SINCE I WAS 7 YEARS OLD
IT
DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT GETTING THE MONEY MYSELF
I THINK ABOUT GREENSBURG KANSAS A TOWN THAT WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED
BY A TORNADO BUT IS BEING REBUILT BY ITS RESIDENTS AS A GLOBAL EXAMPLE
OF HOW CLEAN ENERGY CAN POWER AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY HOW IT CAN BRING
JOBS AND BUSINESSES TO A PLACE WHERE PILES OF BRICKS AND RUBBLE ONCE
LAY
THE TRAGEDY WAS TERRIBLE SAID ONE OF THE MEN WHO HELPED THEM
REBUILD
BUT THE FOLKS HERE KNOW THAT IT ALSO PROVIDED AN INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITY
I THINK ABOUT TY'SHEOMA BETHEA THE YOUNG GIRL FROM THAT SCHOOL I
VISITED IN DILLON SOUTH CAROLINA A PLACE WHERE THE CEILINGS LEAK THE
PAINT PEELS OFF THE WALLS AND THEY HAVE TO STOP TEACHING SIX TIMES A
DAY BECAUSE THE TRAIN BARRELS BY THEIR CLASSROOM
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD
THAT HER SCHOOL IS HOPELESS BUT THE OTHER DAY AFTER CLASS SHE WENT TO
THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND TYPED UP A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE SITTING IN THIS
CHAMBER
SHE EVEN ASKED HER PRINCIPAL FOR THE MONEY TO BUY A STAMP
THE
LETTER ASKS US FOR HELP AND SAYS WE ARE JUST STUDENTS TRYING TO
BECOME LAWYERS DOCTORS CONGRESSMEN LIKE YOURSELF AND ONE DAY
PRESIDENT SO WE CAN MAKE A CHANGE TO NOT JUST THE STATE OF SOUTH
CAROLINA BUT ALSO THE WORLD
WE ARE NOT QUITTERS THAT'S WHAT SHE
SAID WE ARE NOT QUITTERS
THESE WORDS AND THESE STORIES TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE SPIRIT OF THE
PEOPLE WHO SENT US HERE
THEY TELL US THAT EVEN IN THE MOST TRYING
TIMES AMID THE MOST DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS A GENEROSITY A
RESILIENCE A DECENCY AND A DETERMINATION THAT PERSEVERES A
WILLINGNESS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR FUTURE AND FOR POSTERITY
THEIR RESOLVE MUST BE OUR INSPIRATION
THEIR CONCERNS MUST BE OUR CAUSE
AND WE MUST SHOW THEM AND ALL OUR PEOPLE THAT WE ARE EQUAL TO THE TASK
BEFORE US
I KNOW LOOK I KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T AGREED ON EVERY ISSUE THUS FAR
LAUGHTER THERE ARE SURELY TIMES IN THE FUTURE WHERE WE WILL PART WAYS
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT EVERY AMERICAN WHO IS SITTING HERE TONIGHT LOVES
THIS COUNTRY AND WANTS IT TO SUCCEED
I KNOW THAT
THAT MUST BE THE
STARTING POINT FOR EVERY DEBATE WE HAVE IN THE COMING MONTHS AND WHERE
WE RETURN AFTER THOSE DEBATES ARE DONE
THAT IS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT US TO BUILD COMMON GROUND
AND IF WE DO IF WE COME TOGETHER AND LIFT THIS NATION FROM THE DEPTHS
OF THIS CRISIS IF WE PUT OUR PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND RESTART THE
ENGINE OF OUR PROSPERITY IF WE CONFRONT WITHOUT FEAR THE CHALLENGES OF
OUR TIME AND SUMMON THAT ENDURING SPIRIT OF AN AMERICA THAT DOES NOT
QUIT THEN SOMEDAY YEARS FROM NOW OUR CHILDREN CAN TELL THEIR CHILDREN
THAT THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN WE PERFORMED IN THE WORDS THAT ARE CARVED
INTO THIS VERY CHAMBER SOMETHING WORTHY TO BE REMEMBERED
THANK YOU
GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA
THANK YOU
ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
BARACK OBAMA
JANUARY 27 2010
MADAM SPEAKER VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DISTINGUISHED
GUESTS AND FELLOW AMERICANS OUR CONSTITUTION DECLARES THAT FROM TIME
TO TIME THE PRESIDENT SHALL GIVE TO CONGRESS INFORMATION ABOUT THE
STATE OF OUR UNION
FOR 220 YEARS OUR LEADERS HAVE FULFILLED THIS DUTY
THEY'VE DONE SO DURING PERIODS OF PROSPERITY AND TRANQUILITY AND
THEY'VE DONE SO IN THE MIDST OF WAR AND DEPRESSION AT MOMENTS OF GREAT
STRIFE AND GREAT STRUGGLE
IT'S TEMPTING TO LOOK BACK ON THESE MOMENTS AND ASSUME THAT OUR
PROGRESS WAS INEVITABLE THAT AMERICA WAS ALWAYS DESTINED TO SUCCEED
BUT WHEN THE UNION WAS TURNED BACK AT BULL RUN AND THE ALLIES FIRST
LANDED AT OMAHA BEACH VICTORY WAS VERY MUCH IN DOUBT
WHEN THE MARKET
CRASHED ON BLACK TUESDAY AND MARCHERS WERE BEATEN ON BLOODY SUNDAY THE
FUTURE WAS ANYTHING BUT CERTAIN
THESE WERE THE TIMES THAT TESTED THE
COURAGE OF OUR CONVICTIONS AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR UNION
AND DESPITE
ALL OUR DIVISIONS AND DISAGREEMENTS OUR HESITATIONS AND OUR FEARS
AMERICA PREVAILED BECAUSE WE CHOSE TO MOVE FORWARD AS ONE NATION AS
ONE PEOPLE
AGAIN WE ARE TESTED
AND AGAIN WE MUST ANSWER HISTORY'S
CALL
ONE YEAR AGO I TOOK OFFICE AMID TWO WARS AN ECONOMY ROCKED BY A
SEVERE RECESSION A FINANCIAL SYSTEM ON THE VERGE OF COLLAPSE AND A
GOVERNMENT DEEPLY IN DEBT
EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM
WARNED THAT IF WE DID NOT ACT WE MIGHT FACE A SECOND DEPRESSION
SO WE
ACTED IMMEDIATELY AND AGGRESSIVELY
AND 1 YEAR LATER THE WORST OF THE
STORM HAS PASSED
BUT THE DEVASTATION REMAINS
ONE IN 10 AMERICANS STILL CANNOT FIND WORK
MANY BUSINESSES HAVE SHUTTERED
HOME VALUES HAVE DECLINED
SMALL TOWNS
AND RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HIT ESPECIALLY HARD
AND FOR THOSE
WHO'D ALREADY KNOWN POVERTY LIFE'S BECOME THAT MUCH HARDER
THIS RECESSION HAS ALSO COMPOUNDED THE BURDENS THAT AMERICA'S FAMILIES
HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR DECADES THE BURDEN OF WORKING HARDER AND
LONGER FOR LESS OF BEING UNABLE TO SAVE ENOUGH TO RETIRE OR HELP KIDS
WITH COLLEGE
SO I KNOW THE ANXIETIES THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW
THEY'RE NOT NEW
THESE STRUGGLES ARE THE REASON I RAN FOR PRESIDENT
THESE STRUGGLES ARE
WHAT I'VE WITNESSED FOR YEARS IN PLACES LIKE ELKHART INDIANA
GALESBURG ILLINOIS
I HEAR ABOUT THEM IN THE LETTERS THAT I READ EACH
NIGHT
THE TOUGHEST TO READ ARE THOSE WRITTEN BY CHILDREN ASKING WHY
THEY HAVE TO MOVE FROM THEIR HOME ASKING WHEN THEIR MOM OR DAD WILL BE
ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK
FOR THESE AMERICANS AND SO MANY OTHERS CHANGE HAS NOT COME FAST ENOUGH
SOME ARE FRUSTRATED SOME ARE ANGRY
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT SEEMS
LIKE BAD BEHAVIOR ON WALL STREET IS REWARDED BUT HARD WORK ON MAIN
STREET ISN'T OR WHY WASHINGTON HAS BEEN UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO SOLVE
ANY OF OUR PROBLEMS
THEY'RE TIRED OF THE PARTISANSHIP AND THE SHOUTING
AND THE PETTINESS
THEY KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD IT
NOT NOW
SO WE FACE BIG AND DIFFICULT CHALLENGES
AND WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HOPE WHAT THEY DESERVE IS FOR ALL OF US DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
TO WORK THROUGH OUR DIFFERENCES TO OVERCOME THE NUMBING WEIGHT OF OUR
POLITICS
FOR WHILE THE PEOPLE WHO SENT US HERE HAVE DIFFERENT
BACKGROUNDS DIFFERENT STORIES DIFFERENT BELIEFS THE ANXIETIES THEY
FACE ARE THE SAME
THE ASPIRATIONS THEY HOLD ARE SHARED A JOB THAT
PAYS THE BILLS A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD MOST OF ALL THE ABILITY TO GIVE
THEIR CHILDREN A BETTER LIFE
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY SHARE THEY SHARE A STUBBORN RESILIENCE IN
THE FACE OF ADVERSITY
AFTER ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT YEARS IN OUR
HISTORY THEY REMAIN BUSY BUILDING CARS AND TEACHING KIDS STARTING
BUSINESSES AND GOING BACK TO SCHOOL
THEY'RE COACHING LITTLE LEAGUE AND
HELPING THEIR NEIGHBORS
ONE WOMAN WROTE TO ME AND SAID WE ARE
STRAINED BUT HOPEFUL STRUGGLING BUT ENCOURAGED
IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS SPIRIT THIS GREAT DECENCY AND GREAT STRENGTH
THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE HOPEFUL ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE THAN I AM
TONIGHT
DESPITE OUR HARDSHIPS OUR UNION IS STRONG
WE DO NOT GIVE UP
WE DO NOT QUIT
WE DO NOT ALLOW FEAR OR DIVISION TO BREAK OUR SPIRIT
IN THIS NEW DECADE IT'S TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET A GOVERNMENT THAT
MATCHES THEIR DECENCY THAT EMBODIES THEIR STRENGTH
AND TONIGHT I'D
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TOGETHER WE CAN DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE
IT BEGINS WITH OUR ECONOMY
OUR MOST URGENT TASK UPON TAKING OFFICE WAS
TO SHORE UP THE SAME BANKS THAT HELPED CAUSE THIS CRISIS
IT WAS NOT
EASY TO DO
AND IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT HAS UNIFIED DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS AND EVERYBODY IN BETWEEN IT'S THAT WE ALL HATED THE BANK
BAILOUT
I HATED IT
I HATED IT YOU HATED IT
IT WAS ABOUT AS POPULAR
AS A ROOT CANAL
LAUGHTER
BUT WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT I PROMISED I WOULDN'T JUST DO WHAT WAS
POPULAR I WOULD DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY
AND IF WE HAD ALLOWED THE
MELTDOWN OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM UNEMPLOYMENT MIGHT BE DOUBLE WHAT IT
IS TODAY
MORE BUSINESSES WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CLOSED
MORE HOMES WOULD
HAVE SURELY BEEN LOST
SO I SUPPORTED THE LAST ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO CREATE THE
FINANCIAL RESCUE PROGRAM
AND WHEN WE TOOK THAT PROGRAM OVER WE MADE
IT MORE TRANSPARENT AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE
AND AS A RESULT THE MARKETS
ARE NOW STABILIZED AND WE'VE RECOVERED MOST OF THE MONEY WE SPENT ON
THE BANKS MOST BUT NOT ALL
TO RECOVER THE REST I'VE PROPOSED A FEE ON THE BIGGEST BANKS
NOW I
KNOW WALL STREET ISN'T KEEN ON THIS IDEA
BUT IF THESE FIRMS CAN AFFORD
TO HAND OUT BIG BONUSES AGAIN THEY CAN AFFORD A MODEST FEE TO PAY BACK
THE TAXPAYERS WHO RESCUED THEM IN THEIR TIME OF NEED
NOW AS WE STABILIZED THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WE ALSO TOOK STEPS TO GET
OUR ECONOMY GROWING AGAIN SAVE AS MANY JOBS AS POSSIBLE AND HELP
AMERICANS WHO HAD BECOME UNEMPLOYED
THAT'S WHY WE EXTENDED OR
INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FOR MORE THAN 18 MILLION AMERICANS
MADE HEALTH INSURANCE 65 PERCENT CHEAPER FOR FAMILIES WHO GET THEIR
COVERAGE THROUGH COBRA AND PASSED 25 DIFFERENT TAX CUTS
NOW LET ME REPEAT WE CUT TAXES
WE CUT TAXES FOR 95 PERCENT OF
WORKING FAMILIES
WE CUT TAXES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
WE CUT TAXES FOR
FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS
WE CUT TAXES FOR PARENTS TRYING TO CARE FOR
THEIR CHILDREN
WE CUT TAXES FOR 8 MILLION AMERICANS PAYING FOR COLLEGE
APPLAUSE I THOUGHT I'D GET SOME APPLAUSE ON THAT ONE
LAUGHTER
AS A RESULT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAD MORE TO SPEND ON GAS AND FOOD
AND OTHER NECESSITIES ALL OF WHICH HELPED BUSINESSES KEEP MORE WORKERS
AND WE HAVEN'T RAISED INCOME TAXES BY A SINGLE DIME ON A SINGLE PERSON
NOT A SINGLE DIME
NOW BECAUSE OF THE STEPS WE TOOK THERE ARE ABOUT 2 MILLION AMERICANS
WORKING RIGHT NOW WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNEMPLOYED
TWO HUNDRED
THOUSAND WORK IN CONSTRUCTION AND CLEAN ENERGY
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
ARE TEACHERS AND OTHER EDUCATION WORKERS
TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE COPS
FIREFIGHTERS CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FIRST RESPONDERS
AND WE'RE ON
TRACK TO ADD ANOTHER 1 1 2 MILLION JOBS TO THIS TOTAL BY THE END OF THE
YEAR
THE PLAN THAT HAS MADE ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE FROM THE TAX CUTS TO THE
JOBS IS THE RECOVERY ACT
THAT'S RIGHT THE RECOVERY ACT ALSO KNOWN
AS THE STIMULUS BILL
ECONOMISTS ON THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SAY THIS
BILL HAS HELPED SAVE JOBS AND AVERT DISASTER
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE THEIR WORD FOR IT
TALK TO THE SMALL BUSINESS IN PHOENIX THAT WILL
TRIPLE ITS WORKFORCE BECAUSE OF THE RECOVERY ACT
TALK TO THE WINDOW
MANUFACTURER IN PHILADELPHIA WHO SAID HE USED TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE
RECOVERY ACT UNTIL HE HAD TO ADD TWO MORE WORK SHIFTS JUST BECAUSE OF
THE BUSINESS IT CREATED
TALK TO THE SINGLE TEACHER RAISING TWO KIDS
WHO WAS TOLD BY HER PRINCIPAL IN THE LAST WEEK OF SCHOOL THAT BECAUSE
OF THE RECOVERY ACT SHE WOULDN'T BE LAID OFF AFTER ALL
THERE ARE STORIES LIKE THIS ALL ACROSS AMERICA
AND AFTER 2 YEARS OF
RECESSION THE ECONOMY IS GROWING AGAIN
RETIREMENT FUNDS HAVE STARTED
TO GAIN BACK SOME OF THEIR VALUE
BUSINESSES ARE BEGINNING TO INVEST
AGAIN AND SLOWLY SOME ARE STARTING TO HIRE AGAIN
BUT I REALIZE THAT FOR EVERY SUCCESS STORY THERE ARE OTHER STORIES OF
MEN AND WOMEN WHO WAKE UP WITH THE ANGUISH OF NOT KNOWING WHERE THEIR
NEXT PAYCHECK WILL COME FROM WHO SEND OUT RESUMES WEEK AFTER WEEK AND
HEAR NOTHING IN RESPONSE
THAT IS WHY JOBS MUST BE OUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS
IN 2010 AND THAT'S WHY I'M CALLING FOR A NEW JOBS BILL TONIGHT
NOW THE TRUE ENGINE OF JOB CREATION IN THIS COUNTRY WILL ALWAYS BE
AMERICA'S BUSINESSES
APPLAUSE I AGREE ABSOLUTELY
BUT GOVERNMENT
CAN CREATE THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR BUSINESSES TO EXPAND AND HIRE
MORE WORKERS
WE SHOULD START WHERE MOST NEW JOBS DO IN SMALL
BUSINESSES COMPANIES THAT BEGIN WHEN AN ENTREPRENEUR TAKES A CHANCE ON
A DREAM OR A WORKER DECIDES IT'S TIME SHE BECAME HER OWN BOSS
THROUGH
SHEER GRIT AND DETERMINATION THESE COMPANIES HAVE WEATHERED THE
RECESSION AND THEY'RE READY TO GROW
BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO SMALL
BUSINESS OWNERS IN PLACES LIKE ALLENTOWN PENNSYLVANIA OR ELYRIA OHIO
YOU FIND OUT THAT EVEN THOUGH BANKS ON WALL STREET ARE LENDING AGAIN
THEY'RE MOSTLY LENDING TO BIGGER COMPANIES
FINANCING REMAINS DIFFICULT
FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVEN THOSE THAT ARE
MAKING A PROFIT
SO TONIGHT I'M PROPOSING THAT WE TAKE 30 BILLION OF THE MONEY WALL
STREET BANKS HAVE REPAID AND USE IT TO HELP COMMUNITY BANKS GIVE SMALL
BUSINESSES THE CREDIT THEY NEED TO STAY AFLOAT
I'M ALSO PROPOSING A
NEW SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDIT ONE THAT WILL GO TO OVER 1 MILLION SMALL
BUSINESSES WHO HIRE NEW WORKERS OR RAISE WAGES
WHILE WE'RE AT IT
LET'S ALSO ELIMINATE ALL CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ON SMALL BUSINESS
INVESTMENT AND PROVIDE A TAX INCENTIVE FOR ALL LARGE BUSINESSES AND ALL
SMALL BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN NEW PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT
NEXT WE CAN PUT AMERICANS TO WORK TODAY BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
TOMORROW
FROM THE FIRST RAILROADS TO THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM
OUR NATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN BUILT TO COMPETE
THERE'S NO REASON EUROPE
OR CHINA SHOULD HAVE THE FASTEST TRAINS OR THE NEW FACTORIES THAT
MANUFACTURE CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTS
TOMORROW I'LL VISIT TAMPA FLORIDA
WHERE WORKERS WILL SOON BREAK GROUND ON A NEW HIGH SPEED RAILROAD
FUNDED BY THE RECOVERY ACT
THERE ARE PROJECTS LIKE THAT ALL ACROSS
THIS COUNTRY THAT WILL CREATE JOBS AND HELP MOVE OUR NATION'S GOODS
SERVICES AND INFORMATION
WE SHOULD PUT MORE AMERICANS TO WORK BUILDING CLEAN ENERGY FACILITIES
AND GIVE REBATES TO AMERICANS WHO MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE ENERGY
EFFICIENT WHICH SUPPORTS CLEAN ENERGY JOBS
AND TO ENCOURAGE THESE AND
OTHER BUSINESSES TO STAY WITHIN OUR BORDERS IT IS TIME TO FINALLY
SLASH THE TAX BREAKS FOR COMPANIES THAT SHIP OUR JOBS OVERSEAS AND GIVE
THOSE TAX BREAKS TO COMPANIES THAT CREATE JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA
NOW THE HOUSE HAS PASSED A JOBS BILL THAT INCLUDES SOME OF THESE STEPS
AS THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS THIS YEAR I URGE THE SENATE TO DO THE
SAME AND I KNOW THEY WILL
THEY WILL
PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK
THEY'RE
HURTING
THEY NEED OUR HELP
AND I WANT A JOBS BILL ON MY DESK WITHOUT
DELAY
BUT THE TRUTH IS THESE STEPS WON'T MAKE UP FOR THE 7 MILLION JOBS THAT
WE'VE LOST OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS
THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE TO FULL
EMPLOYMENT IS TO LAY A NEW FOUNDATION FOR LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
FINALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THAT AMERICA'S FAMILIES HAVE CONFRONTED
FOR YEARS
WE CAN'T AFFORD ANOTHER SO CALLED ECONOMIC EXPANSION LIKE THE ONE FROM
THE LAST DECADE WHAT SOME CALL THE LOST DECADE WHERE JOBS GREW MORE
SLOWLY THAN DURING ANY PRIOR EXPANSION WHERE THE INCOME OF THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD DECLINED WHILE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE AND TUITION
REACHED RECORD HIGHS WHERE PROSPERITY WAS BUILT ON A HOUSING BUBBLE
AND FINANCIAL SPECULATION
FROM THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT ADDRESSING OUR LARGER
CHALLENGES IS TOO AMBITIOUS SUCH AN EFFORT WOULD BE TOO CONTENTIOUS
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS TOO GRIDLOCKED AND THAT WE
SHOULD JUST PUT THINGS ON HOLD FOR A WHILE
FOR THOSE WHO MAKE THESE
CLAIMS I HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION HOW LONG SHOULD WE WAIT HOW LONG
SHOULD AMERICA PUT ITS FUTURE ON HOLD
YOU SEE WASHINGTON HAS BEEN TELLING US TO WAIT FOR DECADES EVEN AS
THE PROBLEMS HAVE GROWN WORSE
MEANWHILE CHINA'S NOT WAITING TO REVAMP
ITS ECONOMY
GERMANY'S NOT WAITING
INDIA'S NOT WAITING
THESE NATIONS
ARE THEY'RE NOT STANDING STILL
THESE NATIONS AREN'T PLAYING FOR
SECOND PLACE
THEY'RE PUTTING MORE EMPHASIS ON MATH AND SCIENCE
THEY'RE REBUILDING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE
THEY'RE MAKING SERIOUS
INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN ENERGY BECAUSE THEY WANT THOSE JOBS
WELL I DO
NOT ACCEPT SECOND PLACE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AS HARD AS IT
MAY BE AS UNCOMFORTABLE AND CONTENTIOUS AS THE DEBATES MAY BECOME
IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE HAMPERING
OUR GROWTH
NOW ONE PLACE TO START IS SERIOUS FINANCIAL REFORM
LOOK I AM NOT
INTERESTED IN PUNISHING BANKS
I'M INTERESTED IN PROTECTING OUR ECONOMY
A STRONG HEALTHY FINANCIAL MARKET MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR BUSINESSES TO
ACCESS CREDIT AND CREATE NEW JOBS
IT CHANNELS THE SAVINGS OF FAMILIES
INTO INVESTMENTS THAT RAISE INCOMES
BUT THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF WE
GUARD AGAINST THE SAME RECKLESSNESS THAT NEARLY BROUGHT DOWN OUR ENTIRE
ECONOMY
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE CONSUMERS AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES HAVE THE
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE FINANCIAL DECISIONS
WE CAN'T ALLOW
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING THOSE THAT TAKE YOUR DEPOSITS TO
TAKE RISKS THAT THREATEN THE WHOLE ECONOMY
NOW THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY PASSED FINANCIAL REFORM WITH MANY OF THESE
CHANGES AND THE LOBBYISTS ARE TRYING TO KILL IT
BUT WE CANNOT LET
THEM WIN THIS FIGHT
AND IF THE BILL THAT ENDS UP ON MY DESK DOES NOT
MEET THE TEST OF REAL REFORM I WILL SEND IT BACK UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT
WE'VE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT
NEXT WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE AMERICAN INNOVATION
LAST YEAR WE MADE THE
LARGEST INVESTMENT IN BASIC RESEARCH FUNDING IN HISTORY AN INVESTMENT
THAT COULD LEAD TO THE WORLD'S CHEAPEST SOLAR CELLS OR TREATMENT THAT
KILLS CANCER CELLS BUT LEAVES HEALTHY ONES UNTOUCHED
AND NO AREA IS
MORE RIPE FOR SUCH INNOVATION THAN ENERGY
YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS OF
LAST YEAR'S INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN ENERGY IN THE NORTH CAROLINA COMPANY
THAT WILL CREATE 1 200 JOBS NATIONWIDE HELPING TO MAKE ADVANCED
BATTERIES OR IN THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS THAT WILL PUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE
TO WORK MAKING SOLAR PANELS
BUT TO CREATE MORE OF THESE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS WE NEED MORE PRODUCTION
MORE EFFICIENCY MORE INCENTIVES
AND THAT MEANS BUILDING A NEW
GENERATION OF SAFE CLEAN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN THIS COUNTRY
IT
MEANS MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT OPENING NEW OFFSHORE AREAS FOR OIL
AND GAS DEVELOPMENT
IT MEANS CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN ADVANCED BIOFUELS
AND CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGIES
AND YES IT MEANS PASSING A COMPREHENSIVE
ENERGY AND CLIMATE BILL WITH INCENTIVES THAT WILL FINALLY MAKE CLEAN
ENERGY THE PROFITABLE KIND OF ENERGY IN AMERICA
NOW I AM GRATEFUL TO
THE HOUSE FOR PASSING SUCH A BILL LAST YEAR
AND THIS YEAR I'M EAGER
TO HELP ADVANCE THE BIPARTISAN EFFORT IN THE SENATE
I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD SUCH
CHANGES IN A TOUGH ECONOMY
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO DISAGREE
WITH THE OVERWHELMING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE
BUT HERE'S
THE THING EVEN IF YOU DOUBT THE EVIDENCE PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLEAN ENERGY ARE THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR OUR
FUTURE BECAUSE THE NATION THAT LEADS THE CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY WILL BE
THE NATION THAT LEADS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
AND AMERICA MUST BE THAT
NATION
THIRD WE NEED TO EXPORT MORE OF OUR GOODS BECAUSE THE MORE PRODUCTS
WE MAKE AND SELL TO OTHER COUNTRIES THE MORE JOBS WE SUPPORT RIGHT
HERE IN AMERICA
SO TONIGHT WE SET A NEW GOAL WE WILL DOUBLE OUR
EXPORTS OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS AN INCREASE THAT WILL SUPPORT 2 MILLION
JOBS IN AMERICA
TO HELP MEET THIS GOAL WE'RE LAUNCHING A NATIONAL
EXPORT INITIATIVE THAT WILL HELP FARMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES INCREASE
THEIR EXPORTS AND REFORM EXPORT CONTROLS CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL
SECURITY
WE HAVE TO SEEK NEW MARKETS AGGRESSIVELY JUST AS OUR COMPETITORS ARE
IF AMERICA SITS ON THE SIDELINES WHILE OTHER NATIONS SIGN TRADE DEALS
WE WILL LOSE THE CHANCE TO CREATE JOBS ON OUR SHORES
BUT REALIZING
THOSE BENEFITS ALSO MEANS ENFORCING THOSE AGREEMENTS SO OUR TRADING
PARTNERS PLAY BY THE RULES
AND THAT'S WHY WE'LL CONTINUE TO SHAPE A
DOHA TRADE AGREEMENT THAT OPENS GLOBAL MARKETS AND WHY WE WILL
STRENGTHEN OUR TRADE RELATIONS IN ASIA AND WITH KEY PARTNERS LIKE SOUTH
KOREA AND PANAMA AND COLOMBIA
FOURTH WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE SKILLS AND EDUCATION OF OUR PEOPLE
NOW THIS YEAR WE'VE BROKEN THROUGH THE STALEMATE BETWEEN LEFT AND
RIGHT BY LAUNCHING A NATIONAL COMPETITION TO IMPROVE OUR SCHOOLS
AND
THE IDEA HERE IS SIMPLE INSTEAD OF REWARDING FAILURE WE ONLY REWARD
SUCCESS
INSTEAD OF FUNDING THE STATUS QUO WE ONLY INVEST IN REFORM
REFORM THAT RAISES STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT INSPIRES STUDENTS TO EXCEL IN
MATH AND SCIENCE AND TURNS AROUND FAILING SCHOOLS THAT STEAL THE
FUTURE OF TOO MANY YOUNG AMERICANS FROM RURAL COMMUNITIES TO THE INNER
CITY
IN THE 21ST CENTURY THE BEST ANTIPOVERTY PROGRAM AROUND IS A
WORLD CLASS EDUCATION
AND IN THIS COUNTRY THE SUCCESS OF OUR CHILDREN
CANNOT DEPEND MORE ON WHERE THEY LIVE THAN ON THEIR POTENTIAL
WHEN WE
RENEW THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT WE WILL WORK WITH
CONGRESS TO EXPAND THESE REFORMS TO ALL 50 STATES
STILL IN THIS ECONOMY A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA NO LONGER GUARANTEES A
GOOD JOB
THAT'S WHY I URGE THE SENATE TO FOLLOW THE HOUSE AND PASS A
BILL THAT WILL REVITALIZE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH ARE A CAREER
PATHWAY TO THE CHILDREN OF SO MANY WORKING FAMILIES
TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE THIS BILL WILL FINALLY END THE
UNWARRANTED TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES THAT GO TO BANKS FOR STUDENT LOANS
INSTEAD LET'S TAKE THAT MONEY AND GIVE FAMILIES A 10 000 TAX CREDIT
FOR 4 YEARS OF COLLEGE AND INCREASE PELL GRANTS
AND LET'S TELL ANOTHER
1 MILLION STUDENTS THAT WHEN THEY GRADUATE THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO
PAY ONLY 10 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON STUDENT LOANS AND ALL OF THEIR
DEBT WILL BE FORGIVEN AFTER 20 YEARS AND FORGIVEN AFTER 10 YEARS IF
THEY CHOOSE A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE BECAUSE IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA NO ONE SHOULD GO BROKE BECAUSE THEY CHOSE TO GO TO COLLEGE
AND BY THE WAY IT'S TIME FOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO GET SERIOUS
ABOUT CUTTING THEIR OWN COSTS BECAUSE THEY TOO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
NOW THE PRICE OF COLLEGE TUITION IS JUST ONE OF THE BURDENS FACING THE
MIDDLE CLASS
THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR I ASKED VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TO
CHAIR A TASK FORCE ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES
THAT'S WHY WE'RE NEARLY
DOUBLING THE CHILDCARE TAX CREDIT AND MAKING IT EASIER TO SAVE FOR
RETIREMENT BY GIVING ACCESS TO EVERY WORKER A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AND
EXPANDING THE TAX CREDIT FOR THOSE WHO START A NEST EGG
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE WORKING TO LIFT THE VALUE OF A FAMILY'S SINGLE LARGEST INVESTMENT
THEIR HOME
THE STEPS WE TOOK LAST YEAR TO SHORE UP THE HOUSING MARKET
HAVE ALLOWED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO TAKE OUT NEW LOANS AND SAVE AN
AVERAGE OF 1 500 ON MORTGAGE PAYMENTS
THIS YEAR WE WILL STEP UP
REFINANCING SO THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN MOVE INTO MORE AFFORDABLE MORTGAGES
AND IT IS PRECISELY TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN ON MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES THAT
WE STILL NEED HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM
YES WE DO
NOW LET'S CLEAR A FEW THINGS UP
I DIDN'T CHOOSE TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE
TO GET SOME LEGISLATIVE VICTORY UNDER MY BELT
AND BY NOW IT SHOULD BE
FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT I DIDN'T TAKE ON HEALTH CARE BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD
POLITICS
LAUGHTER I TOOK ON HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF THE STORIES I'VE
HEARD FROM AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS WHOSE LIVES DEPEND ON
GETTING COVERAGE PATIENTS WHO'VE BEEN DENIED COVERAGE FAMILIES EVEN
THOSE WITH INSURANCE WHO ARE JUST ONE ILLNESS AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN
AFTER NEARLY A CENTURY OF TRYING DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS WE ARE CLOSER THAN EVER TO BRINGING MORE
SECURITY TO THE LIVES OF SO MANY AMERICANS
THE APPROACH WE'VE TAKEN
WOULD PROTECT EVERY AMERICAN FROM THE WORST PRACTICES OF THE INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
IT WOULD GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES AND UNINSURED AMERICANS A
CHANCE TO CHOOSE AN AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE PLAN IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET
IT WOULD REQUIRE EVERY INSURANCE PLAN TO COVER PREVENTIVE CARE
AND BY THE WAY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA
WHO THIS YEAR IS CREATING A NATIONAL MOVEMENT TO TACKLE THE EPIDEMIC OF
CHILDHOOD OBESITY AND MAKE KIDS HEALTHIER
APPLAUSE THANK YOU HONEY
SHE GETS EMBARRASSED
LAUGHTER
OUR APPROACH WOULD PRESERVE THE RIGHT OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE INSURANCE
TO KEEP THEIR DOCTOR AND THEIR PLAN
IT WOULD REDUCE COSTS AND PREMIUMS
FOR MILLIONS OF FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES
AND ACCORDING TO THE
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE THE INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION THAT BOTH
PARTIES HAVE CITED AS THE OFFICIAL SCOREKEEPER FOR CONGRESS OUR
APPROACH WOULD BRING DOWN THE DEFICIT BY AS MUCH AS 1 TRILLION OVER
THE NEXT TWO DECADES
STILL THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE AND THE LONGER IT WAS DEBATED THE MORE
SKEPTICAL PEOPLE BECAME
I TAKE MY SHARE OF THE BLAME FOR NOT
EXPLAINING IT MORE CLEARLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND I KNOW THAT WITH
ALL THE LOBBYING AND HORSE TRADING THE PROCESS LEFT MOST AMERICANS
WONDERING WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME
BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS PROBLEM IS NOT GOING AWAY
BY THE TIME I'M
FINISHED SPEAKING TONIGHT MORE AMERICANS WILL HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE
MILLIONS WILL LOSE IT THIS YEAR
OUR DEFICIT WILL GROW
PREMIUMS WILL GO UP
PATIENTS WILL BE DENIED THE CARE THEY NEED
SMALL
BUSINESS OWNERS WILL CONTINUE TO DROP COVERAGE ALTOGETHER
I WILL NOT
WALK AWAY FROM THESE AMERICANS AND NEITHER SHOULD THE PEOPLE IN THIS
CHAMBER
SO AS TEMPERATURES COOL I WANT EVERYONE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE
PLAN WE'VE PROPOSED
THERE'S A REASON WHY MANY DOCTORS NURSES AND
HEALTH CARE EXPERTS WHO KNOW OUR SYSTEM BEST CONSIDER THIS APPROACH A
VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER THE STATUS QUO
BUT IF ANYONE FROM EITHER PARTY
HAS A BETTER APPROACH THAT WILL BRING DOWN PREMIUMS BRING DOWN THE
DEFICIT COVER THE UNINSURED STRENGTHEN MEDICARE FOR SENIORS AND STOP
INSURANCE COMPANY ABUSES LET ME KNOW
LET ME KNOW
LET ME KNOW
I'M
EAGER TO SEE IT
HERE'S WHAT I ASK CONGRESS THOUGH DON'T WALK AWAY FROM REFORM
NOT
NOW
NOT WHEN WE ARE SO CLOSE
LET US FIND A WAY TO COME TOGETHER AND
FINISH THE JOB FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
LET'S GET IT DONE
LET'S GET IT
DONE
NOW EVEN AS HEALTH CARE REFORM WOULD REDUCE OUR DEFICIT IT'S NOT
ENOUGH TO DIG US OUT OF A MASSIVE FISCAL HOLE IN WHICH WE FIND
OURSELVES
IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT MAKES ALL OTHERS THAT MUCH HARDER TO
SOLVE AND ONE THAT'S BEEN SUBJECT TO A LOT OF POLITICAL POSTURING
SO
LET ME START THE DISCUSSION OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING BY SETTING THE
RECORD STRAIGHT
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST DECADE THE YEAR 2000 AMERICA HAD A
BUDGET SURPLUS OF OVER 200 BILLION
BY THE TIME I TOOK OFFICE WE HAD
A 1 YEAR DEFICIT OF OVER 1 TRILLION AND PROJECTED DEFICITS OF 8
TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE
MOST OF THIS WAS THE RESULT OF NOT
PAYING FOR TWO WARS TWO TAX CUTS AND AN EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG
PROGRAM
ON TOP OF THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE RECESSION PUT A 3 TRILLION
HOLE IN OUR BUDGET
ALL THIS WAS BEFORE I WALKED IN THE DOOR
LAUGHTER
NOW APPLAUSE JUST STATING THE FACTS
NOW IF WE HAD TAKEN OFFICE IN
ORDINARY TIMES I WOULD HAVE LIKED NOTHING MORE THAN TO START BRINGING
DOWN THE DEFICIT
BUT WE TOOK OFFICE AMID A CRISIS
AND OUR EFFORTS TO
PREVENT A SECOND DEPRESSION HAVE ADDED ANOTHER 1 TRILLION TO OUR
NATIONAL DEBT
THAT TOO IS A FACT
I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
BUT FAMILIES
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS AND MAKING TOUGH
DECISIONS
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO THE SAME
SO TONIGHT I'M
PROPOSING SPECIFIC STEPS TO PAY FOR THE TRILLION DOLLARS THAT IT TOOK
TO RESCUE THE ECONOMY LAST YEAR
STARTING IN 2011 WE ARE PREPARED TO FREEZE GOVERNMENT SPENDING FOR 3
YEARS
SPENDING RELATED TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY MEDICARE MEDICAID
AND SOCIAL SECURITY WILL NOT BE AFFECTED
BUT ALL OTHER DISCRETIONARY
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WILL
LIKE ANY CASH STRAPPED FAMILY WE WILL WORK
WITHIN A BUDGET TO INVEST IN WHAT WE NEED AND SACRIFICE WHAT WE DON'T
AND IF I HAVE TO ENFORCE THIS DISCIPLINE BY VETO I WILL
WE WILL CONTINUE TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET LINE BY LINE PAGE BY PAGE
TO ELIMINATE PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD AND DON'T WORK
WE'VE
ALREADY IDENTIFIED 20 BILLION IN SAVINGS FOR NEXT YEAR
TO HELP
WORKING FAMILIES WE'LL EXTEND OUR MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS
BUT AT A TIME
OF RECORD DEFICITS WE WILL NOT CONTINUE TAX CUTS FOR OIL COMPANIES
FOR INVESTMENT FUND MANAGERS AND FOR THOSE MAKING OVER 250 000 A YEAR
WE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT
NOW EVEN AFTER PAYING FOR WHAT WE SPENT ON MY WATCH WE'LL STILL FACE
THE MASSIVE DEFICIT WE HAD WHEN I TOOK OFFICE
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE
COST OF MEDICARE MEDICAID AND SOCIAL SECURITY WILL CONTINUE TO
SKYROCKET
THAT'S WHY I'VE CALLED FOR A BIPARTISAN FISCAL COMMISSION
MODELED ON A PROPOSAL BY REPUBLICAN JUDD GREGG AND DEMOCRAT KENT CONRAD
THIS CAN'T BE ONE OF THOSE WASHINGTON GIMMICKS THAT LETS US PRETEND WE
SOLVE A PROBLEM
THE COMMISSION WILL HAVE TO PROVIDE A SPECIFIC SET OF
SOLUTIONS BY A CERTAIN DEADLINE
NOW YESTERDAY THE SENATE BLOCKED A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED THIS
COMMISSION SO I'LL ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GO
FORWARD BECAUSE I REFUSE TO PASS THIS PROBLEM ON TO ANOTHER GENERATION
OF AMERICANS
AND WHEN THE VOTE COMES TOMORROW THE SENATE SHOULD
RESTORE THE PAY AS YOU GO LAW THAT WAS A BIG REASON FOR WHY WE HAD
RECORD SURPLUSES IN THE 1990S
NOW I KNOW THAT SOME IN MY OWN PARTY WILL ARGUE THAT WE CAN'T ADDRESS
THE DEFICIT OR FREEZE GOVERNMENT SPENDING WHEN SO MANY ARE STILL
HURTING
AND I AGREE WHICH IS WHY THIS FREEZE WON'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL
NEXT YEAR WHEN THE ECONOMY IS STRONGER
THAT'S HOW BUDGETING WORKS
LAUGHTER BUT UNDERSTAND IF WE DON'T TAKE MEANINGFUL STEPS TO REIN IN
OUR DEBT IT COULD DAMAGE OUR MARKETS INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING
AND JEOPARDIZE OUR RECOVERY ALL OF WHICH WOULD HAVE AN EVEN WORSE
EFFECT ON OUR JOB GROWTH AND FAMILY INCOMES
FROM SOME ON THE RIGHT I EXPECT WE'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT THAT
IF WE JUST MAKE FEWER INVESTMENTS IN OUR PEOPLE EXTEND TAX CUTS
INCLUDING THOSE FOR THE WEALTHIER AMERICANS ELIMINATE MORE REGULATIONS
MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO ON HEALTH CARE OUR DEFICITS WILL GO AWAY
THE
PROBLEM IS THAT'S WHAT WE DID FOR 8 YEARS
THAT'S WHAT HELPED US INTO
THIS CRISIS
IT'S WHAT HELPED LEAD TO THESE DEFICITS
WE CAN'T DO IT
AGAIN
RATHER THAN FIGHT THE SAME TIRED BATTLES THAT HAVE DOMINATED WASHINGTON
FOR DECADES IT'S TIME TO TRY SOMETHING NEW
LET'S INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE
WITHOUT LEAVING THEM A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT
LET'S MEET OUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO THE CITIZENS WHO SENT US HERE
LET'S TRY COMMON SENSE LAUGHTER A
NOVEL CONCEPT
NOW TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE FACE MORE THAN A DEFICIT
OF DOLLARS RIGHT NOW
WE FACE A DEFICIT OF TRUST DEEP AND CORROSIVE
DOUBTS ABOUT HOW WASHINGTON WORKS THAT HAVE BEEN GROWING FOR YEARS
TO
CLOSE THAT CREDIBILITY GAP WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION ON BOTH ENDS OF
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE TO END THE OUTSIZED INFLUENCE OF LOBBYISTS TO DO
OUR WORK OPENLY TO GIVE OUR PEOPLE THE GOVERNMENT THEY DESERVE
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CAME TO WASHINGTON TO DO
THAT'S WHY FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN HISTORY MY ADMINISTRATION POSTS ON OUR WHITE HOUSE VISITORS
ONLINE
THAT'S WHY WE'VE EXCLUDED LOBBYISTS FROM POLICYMAKING JOBS OR
SEATS ON FEDERAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS
BUT WE CAN'T STOP THERE
IT'S
TIME TO REQUIRE LOBBYISTS TO DISCLOSE EACH CONTACT THEY MAKE ON BEHALF
OF A CLIENT WITH MY ADMINISTRATION OR WITH CONGRESS
IT'S TIME TO PUT
STRICT LIMITS ON THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT LOBBYISTS GIVE TO CANDIDATES
FOR FEDERAL OFFICE
WITH ALL DUE DEFERENCE TO SEPARATION OF POWERS LAST WEEK THE SUPREME
COURT REVERSED A CENTURY OF LAW THAT I BELIEVE WILL OPEN THE FLOODGATES
FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS INCLUDING FOREIGN CORPORATIONS TO SPEND WITHOUT
LIMIT IN OUR ELECTIONS
I DON'T THINK AMERICAN ELECTIONS SHOULD BE
BANKROLLED BY AMERICA'S MOST POWERFUL INTERESTS OR WORSE BY FOREIGN
ENTITIES
THEY SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND I'D URGE
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO PASS A BILL THAT HELPS CORRECT SOME OF
THESE PROBLEMS
I'M ALSO CALLING ON CONGRESS TO CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH OF EARMARK
REFORM DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
LOOK
YOU'VE TRIMMED SOME OF THIS SPENDING YOU'VE EMBRACED SOME MEANINGFUL
CHANGE BUT RESTORING THE PUBLIC TRUST DEMANDS MORE
FOR EXAMPLE SOME
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS POST SOME EARMARK REQUESTS ONLINE
TONIGHT I'M
CALLING ON CONGRESS TO PUBLISH ALL EARMARK REQUESTS ON A SINGLE WEB
SITE BEFORE THERE'S A VOTE SO THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE HOW
THEIR MONEY IS BEING SPENT
OF COURSE NONE OF THESE REFORMS WILL EVEN HAPPEN IF WE DON'T ALSO
REFORM HOW WE WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER
NOW I'M NOT NAIVE
I NEVER
THOUGHT THAT THE MERE FACT OF MY ELECTION WOULD USHER IN PEACE AND
HARMONY AND LAUGHTER SOME POSTPARTISAN ERA
I KNEW THAT BOTH
PARTIES HAVE FED DIVISIONS THAT ARE DEEPLY ENTRENCHED
AND ON SOME
ISSUES THERE ARE SIMPLY PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES THAT WILL ALWAYS
CAUSE US TO PART WAYS
THESE DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE ROLE OF
GOVERNMENT IN OUR LIVES ABOUT OUR NATIONAL PRIORITIES AND OUR NATIONAL
SECURITY THEY'VE BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR OVER 200 YEARS
THEY'RE THE
VERY ESSENCE OF OUR DEMOCRACY
BUT WHAT FRUSTRATES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS A WASHINGTON WHERE EVERY DAY
IS ELECTION DAY
WE CAN'T WAGE A PERPETUAL CAMPAIGN WHERE THE ONLY GOAL
IS TO SEE WHO CAN GET THE MOST EMBARRASSING HEADLINES ABOUT THE OTHER
SIDE A BELIEF THAT IF YOU LOSE I WIN
NEITHER PARTY SHOULD DELAY OR
OBSTRUCT EVERY SINGLE BILL JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN
THE CONFIRMATION OF
I'M SPEAKING TO BOTH PARTIES NOW THE CONFIRMATION OF WELL QUALIFIED
PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULDN'T BE HELD HOSTAGE TO THE PET PROJECTS OR
GRUDGES OF A FEW INDIVIDUAL SENATORS
WASHINGTON MAY THINK THAT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE NO
MATTER HOW FALSE NO MATTER HOW MALICIOUS IS JUST PART OF THE GAME
BUT IT'S PRECISELY SUCH POLITICS THAT HAS STOPPED EITHER PARTY FROM
HELPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WORSE YET IT'S SOWING FURTHER DIVISION
AMONG OUR CITIZENS FURTHER DISTRUST IN OUR GOVERNMENT
SO NO I WILL
NOT GIVE UP ON TRYING TO CHANGE THE TONE OF OUR POLITICS
I KNOW IT'S
AN ELECTION YEAR
AND AFTER LAST WEEK IT'S CLEAR THAT CAMPAIGN FEVER
HAS COME EVEN EARLIER THAN USUAL
BUT WE STILL NEED TO GOVERN
TO DEMOCRATS I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT WE STILL HAVE THE LARGEST
MAJORITY IN DECADES AND THE PEOPLE EXPECT US TO SOLVE PROBLEMS NOT RUN
FOR THE HILLS
AND IF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IS GOING TO INSIST THAT
60 VOTES IN THE SENATE ARE REQUIRED TO DO ANY BUSINESS AT ALL IN THIS
TOWN A SUPERMAJORITY THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY TO GOVERN IS NOW YOURS
AS WELL
JUST SAYING NO TO EVERYTHING MAY BE GOOD SHORT TERM POLITICS
BUT IT'S NOT LEADERSHIP
WE WERE SENT HERE TO SERVE OUR CITIZENS NOT
OUR AMBITIONS
SO LET'S SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE CAN DO IT
TOGETHER
THIS WEEK I'LL BE ADDRESSING A MEETING OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS
I'D
LIKE TO BEGIN MONTHLY MEETINGS WITH BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN
LEADERSHIP
I KNOW YOU CAN'T WAIT
LAUGHTER
NOW THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY NO ISSUE HAS UNITED THIS COUNTRY MORE THAN
OUR SECURITY
SADLY SOME OF THE UNITY WE FELT AFTER 9 11 HAS
DISSIPATED
AND WE CAN ARGUE ALL WE WANT ABOUT WHO'S TO BLAME FOR THIS
BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN RELITIGATING THE PAST
I KNOW THAT ALL OF US
LOVE THIS COUNTRY
ALL OF US ARE COMMITTED TO ITS DEFENSE
SO LET'S PUT
ASIDE THE SCHOOLYARD TAUNTS ABOUT WHO'S TOUGH
LET'S REJECT THE FALSE
CHOICE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE AND UPHOLDING OUR VALUES
LET'S
LEAVE BEHIND THE FEAR AND DIVISION AND DO WHAT IT TAKES TO DEFEND OUR
NATION AND FORGE A MORE HOPEFUL FUTURE FOR AMERICA AND FOR THE WORLD
THAT'S THE WORK WE BEGAN LAST YEAR
SINCE THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE WE'VE
RENEWED OUR FOCUS ON THE TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN OUR NATION
WE'VE MADE
SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR HOMELAND SECURITY AND DISRUPTED PLOTS
THAT THREATENED TO TAKE AMERICAN LIVES
WE ARE FILLING UNACCEPTABLE
GAPS REVEALED BY THE FAILED CHRISTMAS ATTACK WITH BETTER AIRLINE
SECURITY AND SWIFTER ACTION ON OUR INTELLIGENCE
WE'VE PROHIBITED
TORTURE AND STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIPS FROM THE PACIFIC TO SOUTH ASIA TO
THE ARABIAN PENINSULA
AND IN THE LAST YEAR HUNDREDS OF AL QAIDA'S
FIGHTERS AND AFFILIATES INCLUDING MANY SENIOR LEADERS HAVE BEEN
CAPTURED OR KILLED FAR MORE THAN IN 2008
AND IN AFGHANISTAN WE'RE INCREASING OUR TROOPS AND TRAINING AFGHAN
SECURITY FORCES SO THEY CAN BEGIN TO TAKE THE LEAD IN JULY OF 2011 AND
OUR TROOPS CAN BEGIN TO COME HOME
WE WILL REWARD GOOD GOVERNANCE WORK
TO REDUCE CORRUPTION AND SUPPORT THE RIGHTS OF ALL AFGHANS MEN AND
WOMEN ALIKE
WE'RE JOINED BY ALLIES AND PARTNERS WHO HAVE INCREASED
THEIR OWN COMMITMENTS AND WHO WILL COME TOGETHER TOMORROW IN LONDON TO
REAFFIRM OUR COMMON PURPOSE
THERE WILL BE DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD BUT I
AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT WE WILL SUCCEED
AS WE TAKE THE FIGHT TO AL QAIDA WE ARE RESPONSIBLY LEAVING IRAQ TO
ITS PEOPLE
AS A CANDIDATE I PROMISED THAT I WOULD END THIS WAR AND
THAT IS WHAT I AM DOING AS PRESIDENT
WE WILL HAVE ALL OF OUR COMBAT
TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ BY THE END OF THIS AUGUST
WE WILL SUPPORT THE IRAQI
GOVERNMENT AS THEY HOLD ELECTIONS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH
THE IRAQI PEOPLE TO PROMOTE REGIONAL PEACE AND PROSPERITY
BUT MAKE NO
MISTAKE THIS WAR IS ENDING AND ALL OF OUR TROOPS ARE COMING HOME
TONIGHT ALL OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM IN IRAQ IN AFGHANISTAN
AND AROUND THE WORLD THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT WE THAT THEY HAVE OUR
RESPECT OUR GRATITUDE OUR FULL SUPPORT
AND JUST AS THEY MUST HAVE
THE RESOURCES THEY NEED IN WAR WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT
THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME
THAT'S WHY WE MADE THE LARGEST INCREASE IN
INVESTMENTS FOR VETERANS IN DECADES LAST YEAR
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
BUILDING A 21ST CENTURY VA
AND THAT'S WHY MICHELLE HAS JOINED WITH
JILL BIDEN TO FORGE A NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT MILITARY FAMILIES
NOW EVEN AS WE PROSECUTE TWO WARS WE'RE ALSO CONFRONTING PERHAPS THE
GREATEST DANGER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
I'VE EMBRACED THE VISION OF JOHN F
KENNEDY AND RONALD REAGAN THROUGH A
STRATEGY THAT REVERSES THE SPREAD OF THESE WEAPONS AND SEEKS A WORLD
WITHOUT THEM
TO REDUCE OUR STOCKPILES AND LAUNCHERS WHILE ENSURING
OUR DETERRENT THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA ARE COMPLETING NEGOTIATIONS
ON THE FARTHEST REACHING ARMS CONTROL TREATY IN NEARLY TWO DECADES
AND
AT APRIL'S NUCLEAR SECURITY SUMMIT WE WILL BRING 44 NATIONS TOGETHER
HERE IN WASHINGTON DC BEHIND A CLEAR GOAL SECURING ALL VULNERABLE
NUCLEAR MATERIALS AROUND THE WORLD IN 4 YEARS SO THAT THEY NEVER FALL
INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS
NOW THESE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS HAVE ALSO STRENGTHENED OUR HAND IN
DEALING WITH THOSE NATIONS THAT INSIST ON VIOLATING INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENTS IN PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
THAT'S WHY NORTH KOREA NOW
FACES INCREASED ISOLATION AND STRONGER SANCTIONS SANCTIONS THAT ARE
BEING VIGOROUSLY ENFORCED
THAT'S WHY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS
MORE UNITED AND THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN IS MORE ISOLATED
AND AS
IRAN'S LEADERS CONTINUE TO IGNORE THEIR OBLIGATIONS THERE SHOULD BE NO
DOUBT THEY TOO WILL FACE GROWING CONSEQUENCES
THAT IS A PROMISE
THAT'S THE LEADERSHIP WE ARE PROVIDING ENGAGEMENT THAT ADVANCES THE
COMMON SECURITY AND PROSPERITY OF ALL PEOPLE
WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE
G 20 TO SUSTAIN A LASTING GLOBAL RECOVERY
WE'RE WORKING WITH MUSLIM
COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO PROMOTE SCIENCE AND EDUCATION AND
INNOVATION
WE HAVE GONE FROM A BYSTANDER TO A LEADER IN THE FIGHT
AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE
WE'RE HELPING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO FEED
THEMSELVES AND CONTINUING THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV AIDS
AND WE ARE
LAUNCHING A NEW INITIATIVE THAT WILL GIVE US THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND
FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVELY TO BIOTERRORISM OR AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE A
PLAN THAT WILL COUNTER THREATS AT HOME AND STRENGTHEN PUBLIC HEALTH
ABROAD
AS WE HAVE FOR OVER 60 YEARS AMERICA TAKES THESE ACTIONS BECAUSE OUR
DESTINY IS CONNECTED TO THOSE BEYOND OUR SHORES
BUT WE ALSO DO IT
BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT
THAT'S WHY AS WE MEET HERE TONIGHT OVER 10 000
AMERICANS ARE WORKING WITH MANY NATIONS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF HAITI
RECOVER AND REBUILD
THAT'S WHY WE STAND WITH THE GIRL WHO YEARNS TO GO
TO SCHOOL IN AFGHANISTAN WHY WE SUPPORT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN
MARCHING THROUGH THE STREETS OF IRAN WHY WE ADVOCATE FOR THE YOUNG MAN
DENIED A JOB BY CORRUPTION IN GUINEA
FOR AMERICA MUST ALWAYS STAND ON
THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND HUMAN DIGNITY ALWAYS
ABROAD AMERICA'S GREATEST SOURCE OF STRENGTH HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR
IDEALS
THE SAME IS TRUE AT HOME
WE FIND UNITY IN OUR INCREDIBLE
DIVERSITY DRAWING ON THE PROMISE ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION THE
NOTION THAT WE'RE ALL CREATED EQUAL THAT NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT
YOU LOOK LIKE IF YOU ABIDE BY THE LAW YOU SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY IT
IF YOU ADHERE TO OUR COMMON VALUES YOU SHOULD BE TREATED NO DIFFERENT
THAN ANYONE ELSE
WE MUST CONTINUALLY RENEW THIS PROMISE
MY ADMINISTRATION HAS A
DIVISION THAT IS ONCE AGAIN PROSECUTING VIOLATIONS AND EMPLOYMENT
DISCRIMINATION
WE FINALLY STRENGTHENED OUR LAWS TO PROTECT AGAINST
CRIMES DRIVEN BY HATE
THIS YEAR I WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS AND OUR
MILITARY TO FINALLY REPEAL THE LAW THAT DENIES GAY AMERICANS THE RIGHT
TO SERVE THE COUNTRY THEY LOVE BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE
IT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO
WE'RE GOING TO CRACK DOWN ON VIOLATIONS OF EQUAL PAY LAWS SO THAT WOMEN
GET EQUAL PAY FOR AN EQUAL DAY'S WORK
AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE THE WORK
OF FIXING OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM TO SECURE OUR BORDERS AND
ENFORCE OUR LAWS AND ENSURE THAT EVERYONE WHO PLAYS BY THE RULES CAN
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY AND ENRICH OUR NATION
IN THE END IT'S OUR IDEALS OUR VALUES THAT BUILT AMERICA VALUES THAT
ALLOWED US TO FORGE A NATION MADE UP OF IMMIGRANTS FROM EVERY CORNER OF
THE GLOBE VALUES THAT DRIVE OUR CITIZENS STILL
EVERY DAY AMERICANS
MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR EMPLOYERS
TIME
AND AGAIN THEY LEND A HAND TO THEIR NEIGHBORS AND GIVE BACK TO THEIR
COUNTRY
THEY TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR LABOR AND ARE GENEROUS IN SPIRIT
THESE AREN'T REPUBLICAN VALUES OR DEMOCRATIC VALUES THAT THEY'RE LIVING
BY BUSINESS VALUES OR LABOR VALUES THEY'RE AMERICAN VALUES
UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY OF OUR CITIZENS HAVE LOST FAITH THAT OUR
BIGGEST INSTITUTIONS OUR CORPORATIONS OUR MEDIA AND YES OUR
GOVERNMENT STILL REFLECT THESE SAME VALUES
EACH OF THESE INSTITUTIONS
ARE FULL OF HONORABLE MEN AND WOMEN DOING IMPORTANT WORK THAT HELPS OUR
COUNTRY PROSPER
BUT EACH TIME A CEO REWARDS HIMSELF FOR FAILURE OR A
BANKER PUTS THE REST OF US AT RISK FOR HIS OWN SELFISH GAIN PEOPLE'S
DOUBTS GROW
EACH TIME LOBBYISTS GAME THE SYSTEM OR POLITICIANS TEAR
EACH OTHER DOWN INSTEAD OF LIFTING THIS COUNTRY UP WE LOSE FAITH
THE
MORE THAT TV PUNDITS REDUCE SERIOUS DEBATES TO SILLY ARGUMENTS BIG
ISSUES INTO SOUND BITES OUR CITIZENS TURN AWAY
NO WONDER THERE'S SO
MUCH CYNICISM OUT THERE
NO WONDER THERE'S SO MUCH DISAPPOINTMENT
I CAMPAIGNED ON THE PROMISE OF CHANGE
CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN THE
SLOGAN WENT
AND RIGHT NOW I KNOW THERE ARE MANY AMERICANS WHO AREN'T
SURE IF THEY STILL BELIEVE WE CAN CHANGE OR THAT I CAN DELIVER IT
BUT REMEMBER THIS I NEVER SUGGESTED THAT CHANGE WOULD BE EASY OR THAT
I COULD DO IT ALONE
DEMOCRACY IN A NATION OF 300 MILLION PEOPLE CAN BE
NOISY AND MESSY AND COMPLICATED
AND WHEN YOU TRY TO DO BIG THINGS AND
MAKE BIG CHANGES IT STIRS PASSIONS AND CONTROVERSY
THAT'S JUST HOW IT
IS
THOSE OF US IN PUBLIC OFFICE CAN RESPOND TO THIS REALITY BY PLAYING IT
SAFE AND AVOID TELLING HARD TRUTHS AND POINTING FINGERS
WE CAN DO
WHAT'S NECESSARY TO KEEP OUR POLL NUMBERS HIGH AND GET THROUGH THE NEXT
ELECTION INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR THE NEXT GENERATION
BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS IF PEOPLE HAD MADE THAT DECISION 50 YEARS AGO OR
100 YEARS AGO OR 200 YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TONIGHT
THE ONLY
REASON WE ARE HERE IS BECAUSE GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS WERE UNAFRAID TO
DO WHAT WAS HARD TO DO WHAT WAS NEEDED EVEN WHEN SUCCESS WAS UNCERTAIN
TO DO WHAT IT TOOK TO KEEP THE DREAM OF THIS NATION ALIVE FOR THEIR
CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN
NOW OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD SOME POLITICAL SETBACKS THIS YEAR AND
SOME OF THEM WERE DESERVED
BUT I WAKE UP EVERY DAY KNOWING THAT THEY
ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE SETBACKS THAT FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY HAVE FACED THIS YEAR
AND WHAT KEEPS ME GOING WHAT KEEPS ME
FIGHTING IS THAT DESPITE ALL THESE SETBACKS THAT SPIRIT OF
DETERMINATION AND OPTIMISM THAT FUNDAMENTAL DECENCY THAT HAS ALWAYS
BEEN AT THE CORE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT LIVES ON
IT LIVES ON IN THE STRUGGLING SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO WROTE TO ME OF
HIS COMPANY NONE OF US HE SAID
ARE WILLING TO CONSIDER
EVEN SLIGHTLY THAT WE MIGHT FAIL IT LIVES ON IN THE WOMAN WHO SAID
THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE AND HER NEIGHBORS HAVE FELT THE PAIN OF RECESSION
WE ARE STRONG
WE ARE RESILIENT
WE ARE AMERICAN IT LIVES ON IN THE
8 YEAR OLD BOY IN LOUISIANA WHO JUST SENT ME HIS ALLOWANCE AND ASKED IF
I WOULD GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE OF HAITI
AND IT LIVES ON IN ALL THE
AMERICANS WHO'VE DROPPED EVERYTHING TO GO SOMEPLACE THEY'VE NEVER BEEN
AND PULL PEOPLE THEY'VE NEVER KNOWN FROM THE RUBBLE PROMPTING CHANTS
OF U S A U S A U S A WHEN ANOTHER LIFE WAS SAVED
THE SPIRIT THAT HAS SUSTAINED THIS NATION FOR MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES
LIVES ON IN YOU ITS PEOPLE
WE HAVE FINISHED A DIFFICULT YEAR
WE HAVE
COME THROUGH A DIFFICULT DECADE
BUT A NEW YEAR HAS COME
A NEW DECADE
STRETCHES BEFORE US
WE DON'T QUIT
I DON'T QUIT
LET'S SEIZE THIS
MOMENT TO START ANEW TO CARRY THE DREAM FORWARD AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR
UNION ONCE MORE
THANK YOU
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
BARACK OBAMA
JANUARY 25 2011
MR
SPEAKER MR
VICE PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DISTINGUISHED
GUESTS AND FELLOW AMERICANS TONIGHT I WANT TO BEGIN BY CONGRATULATING
THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE 112TH CONGRESS AS WELL AS YOUR NEW SPEAKER
JOHN BOEHNER
AND AS WE MARK THIS OCCASION WE'RE ALSO MINDFUL OF THE
EMPTY CHAIR IN THIS CHAMBER AND WE PRAY FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR
COLLEAGUE AND OUR FRIEND GABBY GIFFORDS
IT'S NO SECRET THAT THOSE OF US HERE TONIGHT HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES
OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS
THE DEBATES HAVE BEEN CONTENTIOUS WE HAVE
FOUGHT FIERCELY FOR OUR BELIEFS
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
THAT'S WHAT A
ROBUST DEMOCRACY DEMANDS
THAT'S WHAT HELPS SET US APART AS A NATION
BUT THERE'S A REASON THE TRAGEDY IN TUCSON GAVE US PAUSE
AMID ALL THE
NOISE AND PASSION AND RANCOR OF OUR PUBLIC DEBATE TUCSON REMINDED US
THAT NO MATTER WHO WE ARE OR WHERE WE COME FROM EACH OF US IS A PART
OF SOMETHING GREATER SOMETHING MORE CONSEQUENTIAL THAN PARTY OR
POLITICAL PREFERENCE
WE ARE PART OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY
WE BELIEVE THAT IN A COUNTRY WHERE
EVERY RACE AND FAITH AND POINT OF VIEW CAN BE FOUND WE ARE STILL BOUND
TOGETHER AS ONE PEOPLE THAT WE SHARE COMMON HOPES AND A COMMON CREED
THAT THE DREAMS OF A LITTLE GIRL IN TUCSON ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT THAN
THOSE OF OUR OWN CHILDREN THAT THEY ALL DESERVE THE CHANCE TO BE
FULFILLED
THAT TOO IS WHAT SETS US APART AS A NATION
NOW BY ITSELF THIS SIMPLE RECOGNITION WON'T USHER IN A NEW ERA OF
COOPERATION
WHAT COMES OF THIS MOMENT IS UP TO US
WHAT COMES OF THIS
MOMENT WILL BE DETERMINED NOT BY WHETHER WE CAN SIT TOGETHER TONIGHT
BUT WHETHER WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TOMORROW
I BELIEVE WE CAN AND I BELIEVE WE MUST
THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO
SENT US HERE EXPECT OF US
WITH THEIR VOTES THEY'VE DETERMINED THAT
GOVERNING WILL NOW BE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN PARTIES
NEW LAWS
WILL ONLY PASS WITH SUPPORT FROM DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
WE WILL
MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER OR NOT AT ALL FOR THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE
BIGGER THAN PARTY AND BIGGER THAN POLITICS
AT STAKE RIGHT NOW IS NOT WHO WINS THE NEXT ELECTION
AFTER ALL WE
JUST HAD AN ELECTION
AT STAKE IS WHETHER NEW JOBS AND INDUSTRIES TAKE
ROOT IN THIS COUNTRY OR SOMEWHERE ELSE
IT'S WHETHER THE HARD WORK AND
INDUSTRY OF OUR PEOPLE IS REWARDED
IT'S WHETHER WE SUSTAIN THE
LEADERSHIP THAT HAS MADE AMERICA NOT JUST A PLACE ON A MAP BUT THE
LIGHT TO THE WORLD
WE ARE POISED FOR PROGRESS
TWO YEARS AFTER THE WORST RECESSION MOST OF
US HAVE EVER KNOWN THE STOCK MARKET HAS COME ROARING BACK CORPORATE
PROFITS ARE UP THE ECONOMY IS GROWING AGAIN
BUT WE HAVE NEVER MEASURED PROGRESS BY THESE YARDSTICKS ALONE
WE
MEASURE PROGRESS BY THE SUCCESS OF OUR PEOPLE BY THE JOBS THEY CAN
FIND AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE THOSE JOBS OFFER BY THE PROSPECTS OF A
SMALL BUSINESS OWNER WHO DREAMS OF TURNING A GOOD IDEA INTO A THRIVING
ENTERPRISE BY THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A BETTER LIFE THAT WE PASS ON TO
OUR CHILDREN
THAT'S THE PROJECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT US TO WORK ON TOGETHER
NOW WE DID THAT IN DECEMBER
THANKS TO THE TAX CUTS WE PASSED
AMERICANS' PAYCHECKS ARE A LITTLE BIGGER TODAY
EVERY BUSINESS CAN
WRITE OFF THE FULL COST OF NEW INVESTMENTS THAT THEY MAKE THIS YEAR
AND THESE STEPS TAKEN BY DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WILL GROW THE
ECONOMY AND ADD TO THE MORE THAN 1 MILLION PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS CREATED
LAST YEAR
BUT WE HAVE TO DO MORE
THESE STEPS WE'VE TAKEN OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS
MAY HAVE BROKEN THE BACK OF THIS RECESSION BUT TO WIN THE FUTURE
WE'LL NEED TO TAKE ON CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN DECADES IN THE MAKING
MANY PEOPLE WATCHING TONIGHT CAN PROBABLY REMEMBER A TIME WHEN FINDING
A GOOD JOB MEANT SHOWING UP AT A NEARBY FACTORY OR A BUSINESS DOWNTOWN
YOU DIDN'T ALWAYS NEED A DEGREE AND YOUR COMPETITION WAS PRETTY MUCH
LIMITED TO YOUR NEIGHBORS
IF YOU WORKED HARD CHANCES ARE YOU'D HAVE A
JOB FOR LIFE WITH A DECENT PAYCHECK AND GOOD BENEFITS AND THE
OCCASIONAL PROMOTION
MAYBE YOU'D EVEN HAVE THE PRIDE OF SEEING YOUR
KIDS WORK AT THE SAME COMPANY
THAT WORLD HAS CHANGED
AND FOR MANY THE CHANGE HAS BEEN PAINFUL
I'VE
SEEN IT IN THE SHUTTERED WINDOWS OF ONCE BOOMING FACTORIES AND THE
VACANT STOREFRONTS ON ONCE BUSY MAIN STREETS
I'VE HEARD IT IN THE
FRUSTRATIONS OF AMERICANS WHO'VE SEEN THEIR PAYCHECKS DWINDLE OR THEIR
JOBS DISAPPEAR PROUD MEN AND WOMEN WHO FEEL LIKE THE RULES HAVE BEEN
CHANGED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME
THEY'RE RIGHT
THE RULES HAVE CHANGED
IN A SINGLE GENERATION
REVOLUTIONS IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE TRANSFORMED THE WAY WE LIVE WORK AND
DO BUSINESS
STEEL MILLS THAT ONCE NEEDED 1 000 WORKERS CAN NOW DO THE
SAME WORK WITH 100
TODAY JUST ABOUT ANY COMPANY CAN SET UP SHOP HIRE
WORKERS AND SELL THEIR PRODUCTS WHEREVER THERE'S AN INTERNET
CONNECTION
MEANWHILE NATIONS LIKE CHINA AND INDIA REALIZED THAT WITH SOME CHANGES
OF THEIR OWN THEY COULD COMPETE IN THIS NEW WORLD
AND SO THEY STARTED
EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN EARLIER AND LONGER WITH GREATER EMPHASIS ON
MATH AND SCIENCE
THEY'RE INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES
JUST RECENTLY CHINA BECAME THE HOME TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRIVATE
SOLAR RESEARCH FACILITY AND THE WORLD'S FASTEST COMPUTER
SO YES THE WORLD IS CHANGED
THE COMPETITION FOR JOBS IS REAL
BUT
THIS SHOULDN'T DISCOURAGE US
IT SHOULD CHALLENGE US
REMEMBER FOR ALL
THE HITS WE'VE TAKEN THESE LAST FEW YEARS FOR ALL THE NAYSAYERS
PREDICTING OUR DECLINE AMERICA STILL HAS THE LARGEST MOST PROSPEROUS
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD
NO WORKERS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN OURS
NO
COUNTRY HAS MORE SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES OR GRANTS MORE PATENTS TO
INVENTORS AND ENTREPRENEURS
WE'RE THE HOME TO THE WORLD'S BEST
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHERE MORE STUDENTS COME TO STUDY THAN ANY
PLACE ON EARTH
WHAT'S MORE WE ARE THE FIRST NATION TO BE FOUNDED FOR THE SAKE OF AN
IDEA THE IDEA THAT EACH OF US DESERVES THE CHANCE TO SHAPE OUR OWN
DESTINY
THAT'S WHY CENTURIES OF PIONEERS AND IMMIGRANTS HAVE RISKED
EVERYTHING TO COME HERE
IT'S WHY OUR STUDENTS DON'T JUST MEMORIZE
EQUATIONS BUT ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IDEA
WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE ABOUT THE WORLD WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN YOU
GROW UP
THE FUTURE IS OURS TO WIN
BUT TO GET THERE WE CAN'T JUST STAND STILL
AS ROBERT KENNEDY TOLD US THE FUTURE IS NOT A GIFT
IT IS AN
ACHIEVEMENT SUSTAINING THE AMERICAN DREAM HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT
STANDING PAT
IT HAS REQUIRED EACH GENERATION TO SACRIFICE AND STRUGGLE
AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF A NEW AGE
AND NOW IT'S OUR TURN
WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO COMPETE FOR THE JOBS
AND INDUSTRIES OF OUR TIME
WE NEED TO OUTINNOVATE OUTEDUCATE AND
OUTBUILD THE REST OF THE WORLD
WE HAVE TO MAKE AMERICA THE BEST PLACE
ON EARTH TO DO BUSINESS
WE NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR DEFICIT
AND REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT
THAT'S HOW OUR PEOPLE WILL PROSPER
THAT'S
HOW WE'LL WIN THE FUTURE
AND TONIGHT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET
THERE
THE FIRST STEP IN WINNING THE FUTURE IS ENCOURAGING AMERICAN INNOVATION
NONE OF US CAN PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY WHAT THE NEXT BIG INDUSTRY WILL
BE OR WHERE THE NEW JOBS WILL COME FROM
THIRTY YEARS AGO WE COULDN'T
KNOW THAT SOMETHING CALLED THE INTERNET WOULD LEAD TO AN ECONOMIC
REVOLUTION
WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT AMERICA DOES BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE
IS SPARK THE CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION OF OUR PEOPLE
WE'RE THE NATION
THAT PUT CARS IN DRIVEWAYS AND COMPUTERS IN OFFICES THE NATION OF
EDISON AND THE WRIGHT BROTHERS OF GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK
IN AMERICA
INNOVATION DOESN'T JUST CHANGE OUR LIVES
IT IS HOW WE MAKE OUR LIVING
OUR FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM IS WHAT DRIVES INNOVATION
BUT BECAUSE IT'S
NOT ALWAYS PROFITABLE FOR COMPANIES TO INVEST IN BASIC RESEARCH
THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY OUR GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED CUTTING EDGE
SCIENTISTS AND INVENTORS WITH THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED
THAT'S WHAT
PLANTED THE SEEDS FOR THE INTERNET
THAT'S WHAT HELPED MAKE POSSIBLE
THINGS LIKE COMPUTER CHIPS AND GPS
JUST THINK OF ALL THE GOOD JOBS
FROM MANUFACTURING TO RETAIL THAT HAVE COME FROM THESE BREAKTHROUGHS
HALF A CENTURY AGO WHEN THE SOVIETS BEAT US INTO SPACE WITH THE LAUNCH
OF A SATELLITE CALLED SPUTNIK WE HAD NO IDEA HOW WE WOULD BEAT THEM TO
THE MOON
THE SCIENCE WASN'T EVEN THERE YET
NASA DIDN'T EXIST
BUT
AFTER INVESTING IN BETTER RESEARCH AND EDUCATION WE DIDN'T JUST
SURPASS THE SOVIETS WE UNLEASHED A WAVE OF INNOVATION THAT CREATED NEW
INDUSTRIES AND MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS
THIS IS OUR GENERATION'S SPUTNIK MOMENT
TWO YEARS AGO I SAID THAT WE
NEEDED TO REACH A LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WE HAVEN'T SEEN
SINCE THE HEIGHT OF THE SPACE RACE
AND IN A FEW WEEKS I WILL BE
SENDING A BUDGET TO CONGRESS THAT HELPS US MEET THAT GOAL
WE'LL INVEST
IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ESPECIALLY CLEAN
ENERGY TECHNOLOGY AN INVESTMENT THAT WILL STRENGTHEN OUR SECURITY
PROTECT OUR PLANET AND CREATE COUNTLESS NEW JOBS FOR OUR PEOPLE
ALREADY WE'RE SEEING THE PROMISE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY
ROBERT AND GARY
ALLEN ARE BROTHERS WHO RUN A SMALL MICHIGAN ROOFING COMPANY
AFTER
SEPTEMBER 11 THEY VOLUNTEERED THEIR BEST ROOFERS TO HELP REPAIR THE
PENTAGON
BUT HALF OF THEIR FACTORY WENT UNUSED AND THE RECESSION HIT
THEM HARD
TODAY WITH THE HELP OF A GOVERNMENT LOAN THAT EMPTY SPACE
IS BEING USED TO MANUFACTURE SOLAR SHINGLES THAT ARE BEING SOLD ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY
IN ROBERT'S WORDS WE REINVENTED OURSELVES
THAT'S WHAT AMERICANS HAVE DONE FOR OVER 200 YEARS REINVENTED
OURSELVES
AND TO SPUR ON MORE SUCCESS STORIES LIKE THE ALLEN BROTHERS
WE'VE BEGUN TO REINVENT OUR ENERGY POLICY
WE'RE NOT JUST HANDING OUT
MONEY
WE'RE ISSUING A CHALLENGE
WE'RE TELLING AMERICA'S SCIENTISTS
AND ENGINEERS THAT IF THEY ASSEMBLE TEAMS OF THE BEST MINDS IN THEIR
FIELDS AND FOCUS ON THE HARDEST PROBLEMS IN CLEAN ENERGY WE'LL FUND
THE APOLLO PROJECTS OF OUR TIME
AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE DEVELOPING A WAY TO
TURN SUNLIGHT AND WATER INTO FUEL FOR OUR CARS
AT OAK RIDGE NATIONAL
LABORATORY THEY'RE USING SUPERCOMPUTERS TO GET A LOT MORE POWER OUT OF
OUR NUCLEAR FACILITIES
WITH MORE RESEARCH AND INCENTIVES WE CAN BREAK
OUR DEPENDENCE ON OIL WITH BIOFUELS AND BECOME THE FIRST COUNTRY TO
HAVE A MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BY 2015
WE NEED TO GET BEHIND THIS INNOVATION
AND TO HELP PAY FOR IT I'M
ASKING CONGRESS TO ELIMINATE THE BILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS WE
CURRENTLY GIVE TO OIL COMPANIES
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT
THEY'RE DOING JUST FINE ON THEIR OWN
LAUGHTER SO INSTEAD OF
SUBSIDIZING YESTERDAY'S ENERGY LET'S INVEST IN TOMORROW'S
NOW CLEAN ENERGY BREAKTHROUGHS WILL ONLY TRANSLATE INTO CLEAN ENERGY
JOBS IF BUSINESSES KNOW THERE WILL BE A MARKET FOR WHAT THEY'RE SELLING
SO TONIGHT I CHALLENGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN SETTING A NEW GOAL BY 2035
80 PERCENT OF AMERICA'S ELECTRICITY WILL COME FROM CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES
SOME FOLKS WANT WIND AND SOLAR
OTHERS WANT NUCLEAR CLEAN COAL AND
NATURAL GAS
TO MEET THIS GOAL WE WILL NEED THEM ALL AND I URGE
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
MAINTAINING OUR LEADERSHIP IN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY IS CRUCIAL TO
AMERICA'S SUCCESS
BUT IF WE WANT TO WIN THE FUTURE IF WE WANT
INNOVATION TO PRODUCE JOBS IN AMERICA AND NOT OVERSEAS THEN WE ALSO
HAVE TO WIN THE RACE TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS
THINK ABOUT IT
OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS NEARLY HALF OF ALL NEW JOBS
WILL REQUIRE EDUCATION THAT GOES BEYOND A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION
AND
YET AS MANY AS A QUARTER OF OUR STUDENTS AREN'T EVEN FINISHING HIGH
SCHOOL
THE QUALITY OF OUR MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION LAGS BEHIND MANY
OTHER NATIONS
AMERICA HAS FALLEN TO NINTH IN THE PROPORTION OF YOUNG
PEOPLE WITH A COLLEGE DEGREE
AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ALL OF US
AS CITIZENS AND AS PARENTS ARE WILLING TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY TO GIVE
EVERY CHILD A CHANCE TO SUCCEED
THAT RESPONSIBILITY BEGINS NOT IN OUR CLASSROOMS BUT IN OUR HOMES AND
COMMUNITIES
IT'S FAMILY THAT FIRST INSTILLS THE LOVE OF LEARNING IN A
CHILD
ONLY PARENTS CAN MAKE SURE THE TV IS TURNED OFF AND HOMEWORK
GETS DONE
WE NEED TO TEACH OUR KIDS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE WINNER OF
THE SUPER BOWL WHO DESERVES TO BE CELEBRATED BUT THE WINNER OF THE
SCIENCE FAIR
WE NEED TO TEACH THEM THAT SUCCESS IS NOT A FUNCTION OF
FAME OR PR BUT OF HARD WORK AND DISCIPLINE
OUR SCHOOLS SHARE THIS RESPONSIBILITY
WHEN A CHILD WALKS INTO A
CLASSROOM IT SHOULD BE A PLACE OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND HIGH
PERFORMANCE
BUT TOO MANY SCHOOLS DON'T MEET THIS TEST
THAT'S WHY
INSTEAD OF JUST POURING MONEY INTO A SYSTEM THAT'S NOT WORKING WE
LAUNCHED A COMPETITION CALLED RACE TO THE TOP
TO ALL 50 STATES WE
SAID IF YOU SHOW US THE MOST INNOVATIVE PLANS TO IMPROVE TEACHER
QUALITY AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT WE'LL SHOW YOU THE MONEY
RACE TO THE TOP IS THE MOST MEANINGFUL REFORM OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN
A GENERATION
FOR LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF WHAT WE SPEND ON EDUCATION
EACH YEAR IT HAS LED OVER 40 STATES TO RAISE THEIR STANDARDS FOR
TEACHING AND LEARNING
AND THESE STANDARDS WERE DEVELOPED BY THE WAY
NOT BY WASHINGTON BUT BY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
AND RACE TO THE TOP SHOULD BE THE APPROACH WE
FOLLOW THIS YEAR AS WE REPLACE NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WITH A LAW THAT'S
MORE FLEXIBLE AND FOCUSED ON WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR KIDS
YOU SEE WE KNOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE FROM OUR CHILDREN WHEN REFORM ISN'T
JUST A TOP DOWN MANDATE BUT THE WORK OF LOCAL TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS
SCHOOL BOARDS AND COMMUNITIES
TAKE A SCHOOL LIKE BRUCE RANDOLPH IN
DENVER
THREE YEARS AGO IT WAS RATED ONE OF THE WORST SCHOOLS IN
COLORADO LOCATED ON TURF BETWEEN TWO RIVAL GANGS
BUT LAST MAY 97
PERCENT OF THE SENIORS RECEIVED THEIR DIPLOMA
MOST WILL BE THE FIRST
IN THEIR FAMILIES TO GO TO COLLEGE
AND AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF THE
SCHOOL'S TRANSFORMATION THE PRINCIPAL WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE WIPED AWAY
TEARS WHEN A STUDENT SAID THANK YOU MS
WATERS FOR SHOWING THAT WE
ARE SMART AND WE CAN MAKE IT THAT'S WHAT GOOD SCHOOLS CAN DO AND WE
WANT GOOD SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY
LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THAT AFTER PARENTS THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON A CHILD'S
SUCCESS COMES FROM THE MAN OR WOMAN AT THE FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM
IN
SOUTH KOREA TEACHERS ARE KNOWN AS NATION BUILDERS
HERE IN AMERICA
IT'S TIME WE TREATED THE PEOPLE WHO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN WITH THE SAME
LEVEL OF RESPECT
WE WANT TO REWARD GOOD TEACHERS AND STOP MAKING
EXCUSES FOR BAD ONES
AND OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS WITH SO MANY BABY
BOOMERS RETIRING FROM OUR CLASSROOMS WE WANT TO PREPARE 100 000 NEW
TEACHERS IN THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING AND
MATH
IN FACT TO EVERY YOUNG PERSON LISTENING TONIGHT WHO'S CONTEMPLATING
THEIR CAREER CHOICE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF
OUR NATION IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD
BECOME A TEACHER
YOUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOU
OF COURSE THE EDUCATION RACE DOESN'T END WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA
TO COMPETE HIGHER EDUCATION MUST BE WITHIN THE REACH OF EVERY AMERICAN
THAT'S WHY WE'VE ENDED THE UNWARRANTED TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES THAT WENT TO
BANKS AND USED THE SAVINGS TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR MILLIONS OF
STUDENTS
AND THIS YEAR I ASK CONGRESS TO GO FURTHER AND MAKE
PERMANENT OUR TUITION TAX CREDIT WORTH 10 000 FOR 4 YEARS OF COLLEGE
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN FOR NEW JOBS AND CAREERS IN
TODAY'S FAST CHANGING ECONOMY WE'RE ALSO REVITALIZING AMERICA'S
COMMUNITY COLLEGES
LAST MONTH I SAW THE PROMISE OF THESE SCHOOLS AT
FORSYTH TECH IN NORTH CAROLINA
MANY OF THE STUDENTS THERE USED TO WORK
IN THE SURROUNDING FACTORIES THAT HAVE SINCE LEFT TOWN
ONE MOTHER OF
TWO A WOMAN NAMED KATHY PROCTOR HAD WORKED IN THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY
SINCE SHE WAS 18 YEARS OLD
AND SHE TOLD ME SHE'S EARNING HER DEGREE IN
BIOTECHNOLOGY NOW AT 55 YEARS OLD NOT JUST BECAUSE THE FURNITURE JOBS
ARE GONE BUT BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO INSPIRE HER CHILDREN TO PURSUE THEIR
DREAMS TOO
AS KATHY SAID I HOPE IT TELLS THEM TO NEVER GIVE UP
IF WE TAKE THESE STEPS IF WE RAISE EXPECTATIONS FOR EVERY CHILD AND
GIVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE AT AN EDUCATION FROM THE DAY THEY
ARE BORN UNTIL THE LAST JOB THEY TAKE WE WILL REACH THE GOAL THAT I
SET 2 YEARS AGO BY THE END OF THE DECADE AMERICA WILL ONCE AGAIN HAVE
THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF COLLEGE GRADUATES IN THE WORLD
ONE LAST POINT ABOUT EDUCATION TODAY THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF STUDENTS EXCELLING IN OUR SCHOOLS WHO ARE NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS
SOME ARE THE CHILDREN OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ACTIONS OF THEIR PARENTS
THEY GREW UP AS AMERICANS AND PLEDGE
ALLEGIANCE TO OUR FLAG AND YET THEY LIVE EVERY DAY WITH THE THREAT OF
DEPORTATION
OTHERS COME HERE FROM ABROAD TO STUDY IN OUR COLLEGES AND
UNIVERSITIES
BUT AS SOON AS THEY OBTAIN ADVANCED DEGREES WE SEND THEM
BACK HOME TO COMPETE AGAINST US
IT MAKES NO SENSE
NOW I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD TAKE ON ONCE AND FOR ALL THE
ISSUE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION
AND I AM PREPARED TO WORK WITH
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS ENFORCE OUR LAWS AND
ADDRESS THE MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO ARE NOW LIVING IN THE
SHADOWS
I KNOW THAT DEBATE WILL BE DIFFICULT
I KNOW IT WILL TAKE TIME
BUT TONIGHT LET'S AGREE TO MAKE THAT EFFORT
AND LET'S STOP EXPELLING
TALENTED RESPONSIBLE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO COULD BE STAFFING OUR RESEARCH
LABS OR STARTING A NEW BUSINESS WHO COULD BE FURTHER ENRICHING THIS
NATION
THE THIRD STEP IN WINNING THE FUTURE IS REBUILDING AMERICA
TO ATTRACT
NEW BUSINESSES TO OUR SHORES WE NEED THE FASTEST MOST RELIABLE WAYS
TO MOVE PEOPLE GOODS AND INFORMATION FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL TO HIGH
SPEED INTERNET
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO BE THE BEST BUT OUR LEAD HAS SLIPPED
SOUTH
KOREAN HOMES NOW HAVE GREATER INTERNET ACCESS THAN WE DO
COUNTRIES IN
EUROPE AND RUSSIA INVEST MORE IN THEIR ROADS AND RAILWAYS THAN WE DO
CHINA IS BUILDING FASTER TRAINS AND NEWER AIRPORTS
MEANWHILE WHEN OUR
OWN ENGINEERS GRADED OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE THEY GAVE US A D
WE HAVE TO DO BETTER
AMERICA IS THE NATION THAT BUILT THE
TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD BROUGHT ELECTRICITY TO RURAL COMMUNITIES
CONSTRUCTED THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM
THE JOBS CREATED BY THESE
PROJECTS DIDN'T JUST COME FROM LAYING DOWN TRACK OR PAVEMENT
THEY CAME
FROM BUSINESSES THAT OPENED NEAR A TOWN'S NEW TRAIN STATION OR THE NEW
OFF RAMP
SO OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS WE'VE BEGUN REBUILDING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
A PROJECT THAT HAS MEANT THOUSANDS OF GOOD JOBS FOR THE HARD HIT
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
AND TONIGHT I'M PROPOSING THAT WE REDOUBLE THOSE
EFFORTS
WE'LL PUT MORE AMERICANS TO WORK REPAIRING CRUMBLING ROADS AND BRIDGES
WE'LL MAKE SURE THIS IS FULLY PAID FOR ATTRACT PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND
PICK PROJECTS BASED ON WHAT'S BEST FOR THE ECONOMY NOT POLITICIANS
WITHIN 25 YEARS OUR GOAL IS TO GIVE 80 PERCENT OF AMERICANS ACCESS TO
HIGH SPEED RAIL
THIS COULD ALLOW YOU TO GO PLACES IN HALF THE TIME IT
TAKES TO TRAVEL BY CAR
FOR SOME TRIPS IT WILL BE FASTER THAN FLYING
WITHOUT THE PAT DOWN
LAUGHTER AS WE SPEAK ROUTES IN CALIFORNIA AND
THE MIDWEST ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY
WITHIN THE NEXT 5 YEARS WE'LL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR BUSINESSES TO
DEPLOY THE NEXT GENERATION OF HIGH SPEED WIRELESS COVERAGE TO 98
PERCENT OF ALL AMERICANS
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT
FASTER INTERNET OR FEWER DROPPED CALLS
IT'S ABOUT CONNECTING EVERY
PART OF AMERICA TO THE DIGITAL AGE
IT'S ABOUT A RURAL COMMUNITY IN
IOWA OR ALABAMA WHERE FARMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WILL BE ABLE TO
SELL THEIR PRODUCTS ALL OVER THE WORLD
IT'S ABOUT A FIREFIGHTER WHO
CAN DOWNLOAD THE DESIGN OF A BURNING BUILDING ONTO A HANDHELD DEVICE A
STUDENT WHO CAN TAKE CLASSES WITH A DIGITAL TEXTBOOK OR A PATIENT WHO
CAN HAVE FACE TO FACE VIDEO CHATS WITH HER DOCTOR
ALL THESE INVESTMENTS IN INNOVATION EDUCATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE
WILL MAKE AMERICA A BETTER PLACE TO DO BUSINESS AND CREATE JOBS
BUT TO
HELP OUR COMPANIES COMPETE WE ALSO HAVE TO KNOCK DOWN BARRIERS THAT
STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR SUCCESS
FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE YEARS A PARADE OF LOBBYISTS HAS RIGGED THE TAX
CODE TO BENEFIT PARTICULAR COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES
THOSE WITH
ACCOUNTANTS OR LAWYERS TO WORK THE SYSTEM CAN END UP PAYING NO TAXES AT
ALL
BUT ALL THE REST ARE HIT WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX
RATES IN THE WORLD
IT MAKES NO SENSE AND IT HAS TO CHANGE
SO TONIGHT I'M ASKING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM
GET RID OF THE LOOPHOLES LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND USE THE SAVINGS
TO LOWER THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 25 YEARS WITHOUT
ADDING TO OUR DEFICIT
IT CAN BE DONE
TO HELP BUSINESSES SELL MORE PRODUCTS ABROAD WE SET A GOAL OF DOUBLING
OUR EXPORTS BY 2014
BECAUSE THE MORE WE EXPORT THE MORE JOBS WE
CREATE HERE AT HOME
ALREADY OUR EXPORTS ARE UP
RECENTLY WE SIGNED
AGREEMENTS WITH INDIA AND CHINA THAT WILL SUPPORT MORE THAN 250 000
JOBS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES
AND LAST MONTH WE FINALIZED A TRADE
AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA THAT WILL SUPPORT AT LEAST 70 000 AMERICAN
JOBS
THIS AGREEMENT HAS UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT FROM BUSINESS AND LABOR
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND I ASK THIS CONGRESS TO PASS IT AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE
NOW BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE I MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WOULD ENFORCE OUR
TRADE AGREEMENTS AND THAT I WOULD ONLY SIGN DEALS THAT KEEP FAITH WITH
AMERICAN WORKERS AND PROMOTE AMERICAN JOBS
THAT'S WHAT WE DID WITH
KOREA AND THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO AS WE PURSUE AGREEMENTS WITH
PANAMA AND COLOMBIA AND CONTINUE OUR ASIA PACIFIC AND GLOBAL TRADE
TALKS
TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO GROWTH AND INVESTMENT I'VE ORDERED A REVIEW OF
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
WHEN WE FIND RULES THAT PUT AN UNNECESSARY
BURDEN ON BUSINESSES WE WILL FIX THEM
BUT I WILL NOT HESITATE TO
CREATE OR ENFORCE COMMONSENSE SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY
IT'S
WHY OUR FOOD IS SAFE TO EAT OUR WATER IS SAFE TO DRINK AND OUR AIR IS
SAFE TO BREATHE
IT'S WHY WE HAVE SPEED LIMITS AND CHILD LABOR LAWS
IT'S WHY LAST YEAR WE PUT IN PLACE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AGAINST HIDDEN
FEES AND PENALTIES BY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES AND NEW RULES TO PREVENT
ANOTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS
AND IT'S WHY WE PASSED REFORM THAT FINALLY
PREVENTS THE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY FROM EXPLOITING PATIENTS
NOW I HAVE HEARD RUMORS THAT A FEW OF YOU STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
OUR NEW HEALTH CARE LAW
LAUGHTER SO LET ME BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT
ANYTHING CAN BE IMPROVED
IF YOU HAVE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THIS
LAW BY MAKING CARE BETTER OR MORE AFFORDABLE I AM EAGER TO WORK WITH
YOU
WE CAN START RIGHT NOW BY CORRECTING A FLAW IN THE LEGISLATION
THAT HAS PLACED AN UNNECESSARY BOOKKEEPING BURDEN ON SMALL BUSINESSES
WHAT I'M NOT WILLING TO DO WHAT I'M NOT WILLING TO DO IS GO BACK TO
THE DAYS WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD DENY SOMEONE COVERAGE BECAUSE
OF A PREEXISTING CONDITION
I'M NOT WILLING TO TELL JAMES HOWARD A BRAIN CANCER PATIENT FROM TEXAS
THAT HIS TREATMENT MIGHT NOT BE COVERED
I'M NOT WILLING TO TELL JIM
HOUSER A SMALL BUSINESSMAN FROM OREGON THAT HE HAS TO GO BACK TO
PAYING 5 000 MORE TO COVER HIS EMPLOYEES
AS WE SPEAK THIS LAW IS
MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CHEAPER FOR SENIORS AND GIVING UNINSURED
STUDENTS A CHANCE TO STAY ON THEIR PATIENTS' PARENTS' COVERAGE
SO I SAY TO THIS CHAMBER TONIGHT INSTEAD OF REFIGHTING THE BATTLES OF
THE LAST 2 YEARS LET'S FIX WHAT NEEDS FIXING AND LET'S MOVE FORWARD
NOW THE FINAL CRITICAL STEP IN WINNING THE FUTURE IS TO MAKE SURE WE
AREN'T BURIED UNDER A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT
WE ARE LIVING WITH A LEGACY OF DEFICIT SPENDING THAT BEGAN ALMOST A
DECADE AGO
AND IN THE WAKE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS SOME OF THAT WAS
NECESSARY TO KEEP CREDIT FLOWING SAVE JOBS AND PUT MONEY IN PEOPLE'S
POCKETS
BUT NOW THAT THE WORST OF THE RECESSION IS OVER WE HAVE TO CONFRONT
THE FACT THAT OUR GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE THAN IT TAKES IN
THAT IS NOT
SUSTAINABLE
EVERY DAY FAMILIES SACRIFICE TO LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS
THEY DESERVE A GOVERNMENT THAT DOES THE SAME
SO TONIGHT I AM PROPOSING THAT STARTING THIS YEAR WE FREEZE ANNUAL
DOMESTIC SPENDING FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS
NOW THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
DEFICIT BY MORE THAN 400 BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND WILL BRING
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING TO THE LOWEST SHARE OF OUR ECONOMY SINCE DWIGHT
EISENHOWER WAS PRESIDENT
THIS FREEZE WILL REQUIRE PAINFUL CUTS
ALREADY WE'VE FROZEN THE
SALARIES OF HARD WORKING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES FOR THE NEXT 2 YEARS
I'VE
PROPOSED CUTS TO THINGS I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT LIKE COMMUNITY ACTION
PROGRAMS
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS ALSO AGREED TO CUT TENS OF
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SPENDING THAT HE AND HIS GENERALS BELIEVE OUR
MILITARY CAN DO WITHOUT
NOW I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME IN THIS CHAMBER HAVE ALREADY PROPOSED DEEPER
CUTS AND I'M WILLING TO ELIMINATE WHATEVER WE CAN HONESTLY AFFORD TO
DO WITHOUT
BUT LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING IT ON THE BACKS OF
OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS
AND LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE
CUTTING IS REALLY EXCESS WEIGHT
CUTTING THE DEFICIT BY GUTTING OUR
INVESTMENTS IN INNOVATION AND EDUCATION IS LIKE LIGHTENING AN
OVERLOADED AIRPLANE BY REMOVING ITS ENGINE
IT MAY MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE FLYING HIGH AT FIRST BUT IT WON'T TAKE LONG BEFORE YOU FEEL THE
IMPACT
LAUGHTER
NOW MOST OF THE CUTS AND SAVINGS I'VE PROPOSED ONLY ADDRESS ANNUAL
DOMESTIC SPENDING WHICH REPRESENTS A LITTLE MORE THAN 12 PERCENT OF
OUR BUDGET
TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS WE HAVE TO STOP PRETENDING THAT
CUTTING THIS KIND OF SPENDING ALONE WILL BE ENOUGH
IT WON'T
THE BIPARTISAN FISCAL COMMISSION I CREATED LAST YEAR MADE THIS CRYSTAL
CLEAR
I DON'T AGREE WITH ALL THEIR PROPOSALS BUT THEY MADE IMPORTANT
PROGRESS
AND THEIR CONCLUSION IS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TACKLE OUR
DEFICIT IS TO CUT EXCESSIVE SPENDING WHEREVER WE FIND IT IN DOMESTIC
SPENDING DEFENSE SPENDING HEALTH CARE SPENDING AND SPENDING THROUGH
TAX BREAKS AND LOOPHOLES
THIS MEANS FURTHER REDUCING HEALTH CARE COSTS INCLUDING PROGRAMS LIKE
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID WHICH ARE THE SINGLE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR
LONG TERM DEFICIT
THE HEALTH INSURANCE LAW WE PASSED LAST YEAR WILL
SLOW THESE RISING COSTS WHICH IS PART OF THE REASON THAT NONPARTISAN
ECONOMISTS HAVE SAID THAT REPEALING THE HEALTH CARE LAW WOULD ADD A
QUARTER OF A TRILLION DOLLARS TO OUR DEFICIT
STILL I'M WILLING TO
LOOK AT OTHER IDEAS TO BRING DOWN COSTS INCLUDING ONE THAT REPUBLICANS
SUGGESTED LAST YEAR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE REFORM TO REIN IN FRIVOLOUS
LAWSUITS
TO PUT US ON SOLID GROUND WE SHOULD ALSO FIND A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO
STRENGTHEN SOCIAL SECURITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
WE MUST DO IT
WITHOUT PUTTING AT RISK CURRENT RETIREES THE MOST VULNERABLE OR
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WITHOUT SLASHING BENEFITS FOR FUTURE
GENERATIONS AND WITHOUT SUBJECTING AMERICANS' GUARANTEED RETIREMENT
INCOME TO THE WHIMS OF THE STOCK MARKET
AND IF WE TRULY CARE ABOUT OUR DEFICIT WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD A
PERMANENT EXTENSION OF THE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST 2 PERCENT OF
AMERICANS
BEFORE WE TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM OUR SCHOOLS OR SCHOLARSHIPS
AWAY FROM OUR STUDENTS WE SHOULD ASK MILLIONAIRES TO GIVE UP THEIR TAX
BREAK
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF PUNISHING THEIR SUCCESS IT'S ABOUT
PROMOTING AMERICA'S SUCCESS
IN FACT THE BEST THING WE COULD DO ON TAXES FOR ALL AMERICANS IS TO
SIMPLIFY THE INDIVIDUAL TAX CODE
THIS WILL BE A TOUGH JOB BUT MEMBERS
OF BOTH PARTIES HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN DOING THIS AND I AM
PREPARED TO JOIN THEM
SO NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT
NOW IS THE TIME FOR BOTH SIDES AND BOTH
HOUSES OF CONGRESS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO FORGE A PRINCIPLED
COMPROMISE THAT GETS THE JOB DONE
IF WE MAKE THE HARD CHOICES NOW TO
REIN IN OUR DEFICITS WE CAN MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO WIN THE
FUTURE
LET ME TAKE THIS ONE STEP FURTHER
WE SHOULDN'T JUST GIVE OUR PEOPLE A
GOVERNMENT THAT'S MORE AFFORDABLE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM A GOVERNMENT
THAT'S MORE COMPETENT AND MORE EFFICIENT
WE CAN'T WIN THE FUTURE WITH
A GOVERNMENT OF THE PAST
WE LIVE AND DO BUSINESS IN THE INFORMATION AGE BUT THE LAST MAJOR
REORGANIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT HAPPENED IN THE AGE OF BLACK AND WHITE
TV
THERE ARE 12 DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT DEAL WITH EXPORTS
THERE ARE
AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT DEAL WITH HOUSING POLICY
THEN
THERE'S MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT IS IN CHARGE OF
SALMON WHILE THEY'RE IN FRESH WATER BUT THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
HANDLES THEM WHEN THEY'RE IN SALTWATER
LAUGHTER I HEAR IT GETS EVEN
MORE COMPLICATED ONCE THEY'RE SMOKED
LAUGHTER
NOW WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS IN USING TECHNOLOGY
AND GETTING RID OF WASTE
VETERANS CAN NOW DOWNLOAD THEIR ELECTRONIC
MEDICAL RECORDS WITH A CLICK OF THE MOUSE
WE'RE SELLING ACRES OF
FEDERAL OFFICE SPACE THAT HASN'T BEEN USED IN YEARS AND WE'LL CUT
THROUGH REDTAPE TO GET RID OF MORE
BUT WE NEED TO THINK BIGGER
IN THE
COMING MONTHS MY ADMINISTRATION WILL DEVELOP A PROPOSAL TO MERGE
CONSOLIDATE AND REORGANIZE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN A WAY THAT BEST
SERVES THE GOAL OF A MORE COMPETITIVE AMERICA
I WILL SUBMIT THAT
PROPOSAL TO CONGRESS FOR A VOTE AND WE WILL PUSH TO GET IT PASSED
IN THE COMING YEAR WE'LL ALSO WORK TO REBUILD PEOPLE'S FAITH IN THE
INSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW AND
WHERE YOUR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GO TO A WEB
SITE AND GET THAT INFORMATION FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN HISTORY
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE TO KNOW WHEN YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE MEETING
WITH LOBBYISTS I ASK CONGRESS TO DO WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ALREADY
DONE PUT THAT INFORMATION ONLINE
AND BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
DESERVE TO KNOW THAT SPECIAL INTERESTS AREN'T LARDING UP LEGISLATION
WITH PET PROJECTS BOTH PARTIES IN CONGRESS SHOULD KNOW THIS IF A BILL
COMES TO MY DESK WITH EARMARKS INSIDE I WILL VETO IT
I WILL VETO IT
THE 21ST CENTURY GOVERNMENT THAT'S OPEN AND COMPETENT A GOVERNMENT
THAT LIVES WITHIN ITS MEANS AN ECONOMY THAT'S DRIVEN BY NEW SKILLS AND
NEW IDEAS OUR SUCCESS IN THIS NEW AND CHANGING WORLD WILL REQUIRE
REFORM RESPONSIBILITY AND INNOVATION
IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE US TO
APPROACH THAT WORLD WITH A NEW LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT IN OUR FOREIGN
AFFAIRS
JUST AS JOBS AND BUSINESSES CAN NOW RACE ACROSS BORDERS SO CAN NEW
THREATS AND NEW CHALLENGES
NO SINGLE WALL SEPARATES EAST AND WEST
NO
ONE RIVAL SUPERPOWER IS ALIGNED AGAINST US
AND SO WE MUST DEFEAT DETERMINED ENEMIES WHEREVER THEY ARE AND BUILD
COALITIONS THAT CUT ACROSS LINES OF REGION AND RACE AND RELIGION
AND
AMERICA'S MORAL EXAMPLE MUST ALWAYS SHINE FOR ALL WHO YEARN FOR FREEDOM
AND JUSTICE AND DIGNITY
AND BECAUSE WE'VE BEGUN THIS WORK TONIGHT WE
CAN SAY THAT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN RENEWED AND AMERICA'S
STANDING HAS BEEN RESTORED
LOOK TO IRAQ WHERE NEARLY 100 000 OF OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE LEFT
WITH THEIR HEADS HELD HIGH
AMERICAN COMBAT PATROLS HAVE ENDED
VIOLENCE IS DOWN AND A NEW GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FORMED
THIS YEAR OUR
CIVILIANS WILL FORGE A LASTING PARTNERSHIP WITH THE IRAQI PEOPLE WHILE
WE FINISH THE JOB OF BRINGING OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ
AMERICA'S
COMMITMENT HAS BEEN KEPT
THE IRAQ WAR IS COMING TO AN END
OF COURSE AS WE SPEAK AL QAIDA AND THEIR AFFILIATES CONTINUE TO PLAN
ATTACKS AGAINST US
THANKS TO OUR INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
PROFESSIONALS WE'RE DISRUPTING PLOTS AND SECURING OUR CITIES AND SKIES
AND AS EXTREMISTS TRY TO INSPIRE ACTS OF VIOLENCE WITHIN OUR BORDERS
WE ARE RESPONDING WITH THE STRENGTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES WITH RESPECT
FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND WITH THE CONVICTION THAT AMERICAN MUSLIMS ARE
A PART OF OUR AMERICAN FAMILY
WE'VE ALSO TAKEN THE FIGHT TO AL QAIDA AND THEIR ALLIES ABROAD
IN
AFGHANISTAN OUR TROOPS HAVE TAKEN TALIBAN STRONGHOLDS AND TRAINED
AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES
OUR PURPOSE IS CLEAR BY PREVENTING THE TALIBAN
FROM REESTABLISHING A STRANGLEHOLD OVER THE AFGHAN PEOPLE WE WILL DENY
AL QAIDA THE SAFE HAVEN THAT SERVED AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR 9 11
THANKS TO OUR HEROIC TROOPS AND CIVILIANS FEWER AFGHANS ARE UNDER THE
CONTROL OF THE INSURGENCY
THERE WILL BE TOUGH FIGHTING AHEAD AND THE
AFGHAN GOVERNMENT WILL NEED TO DELIVER BETTER GOVERNANCE
BUT WE ARE
STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE AND BUILDING AN
ENDURING PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM
THIS YEAR WE WILL WORK WITH NEARLY 50
COUNTRIES TO BEGIN A TRANSITION TO AN AFGHAN LEAD AND THIS JULY WE
WILL BEGIN TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME
IN PAKISTAN AL QAIDA'S LEADERSHIP IS UNDER MORE PRESSURE THAN AT ANY
POINT SINCE 2001
THEIR LEADERS AND OPERATIVES ARE BEING REMOVED FROM
THE BATTLEFIELD
THEIR SAFE HAVENS ARE SHRINKING
AND WE'VE SENT A
MESSAGE FROM THE AFGHAN BORDER TO THE ARABIAN PENINSULA TO ALL PARTS OF
THE GLOBE WE WILL NOT RELENT WE WILL NOT WAVER AND WE WILL DEFEAT
YOU
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP CAN ALSO BE SEEN IN THE EFFORT TO SECURE THE WORST
WEAPONS OF WAR
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS APPROVED THE NEW
START TREATY FAR FEWER NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND LAUNCHERS WILL BE DEPLOYED
BECAUSE WE RALLIED THE WORLD NUCLEAR MATERIALS ARE BEING LOCKED DOWN
ON EVERY CONTINENT SO THEY NEVER FALL INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS
BECAUSE OF A DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO INSIST THAT IRAN MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS
THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT NOW FACES TOUGHER SANCTIONS TIGHTER SANCTIONS
THAN EVER BEFORE
AND ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA WE STAND WITH OUR ALLY
SOUTH KOREA AND INSIST THAT NORTH KOREA KEEPS ITS COMMITMENT TO ABANDON
NUCLEAR WEAPONS
THIS IS JUST A PART OF HOW WE'RE SHAPING A WORLD THAT FAVORS PEACE AND
PROSPERITY
WITH OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES WE REVITALIZED NATO AND INCREASED
OUR COOPERATION ON EVERYTHING FROM COUNTERTERRORISM TO MISSILE DEFENSE
WE'VE RESET OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA STRENGTHENED ASIAN ALLIANCES
BUILT NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH NATIONS LIKE INDIA
THIS MARCH I WILL TRAVEL TO BRAZIL CHILE AND EL SALVADOR TO FORGE
NEW ALLIANCES ACROSS THE AMERICAS
AROUND THE GLOBE WE'RE STANDING
WITH THOSE WHO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY HELPING FARMERS GROW MORE FOOD
SUPPORTING DOCTORS WHO CARE FOR THE SICK AND COMBATING THE CORRUPTION
THAT CAN ROT A SOCIETY AND ROB PEOPLE OF OPPORTUNITY
RECENT EVENTS HAVE SHOWN US THAT WHAT SETS US APART MUST NOT JUST BE
OUR POWER IT MUST ALSO BE THE PURPOSE BEHIND IT
IN SOUTH SUDAN WITH
OUR ASSISTANCE THE PEOPLE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO VOTE FOR INDEPENDENCE
AFTER YEARS OF WAR
THOUSANDS LINED UP BEFORE DAWN
PEOPLE DANCED IN
THE STREETS
ONE MAN WHO LOST FOUR OF HIS BROTHERS AT WAR SUMMED UP THE
SCENE AROUND HIM
THIS WAS A BATTLEFIELD FOR MOST OF MY LIFE HE SAID
NOW WE WANT TO BE FREE
AND WE SAW THAT SAME DESIRE TO BE FREE IN TUNISIA WHERE THE WILL OF
THE PEOPLE PROVED MORE POWERFUL THAN THE WRIT OF A DICTATOR
AND
TONIGHT LET US BE CLEAR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA STANDS WITH THE
PEOPLE OF TUNISIA AND SUPPORTS THE DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS OF ALL PEOPLE
WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT THE THINGS WE'VE STRUGGLED FOR AND FOUGHT FOR
LIVE IN THE HEARTS OF PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
AND WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER
THAT THE AMERICANS WHO HAVE BORNE THE GREATEST BURDEN IN THIS STRUGGLE
ARE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY
TONIGHT LET US SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE IN REAFFIRMING THAT OUR NATION IS
UNITED IN SUPPORT OF OUR TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES
LET US SERVE THEM
AS WELL AS THEY'VE SERVED US BY GIVING THEM THE EQUIPMENT THEY NEED
BY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE CARE AND BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE EARNED AND
BY ENLISTING OUR VETERANS IN THE GREAT TASK OF BUILDING OUR OWN NATION
OUR TROOPS COME FROM EVERY CORNER OF THIS COUNTRY
THEY'RE BLACK WHITE
LATINO ASIAN NATIVE AMERICAN
THEY ARE CHRISTIAN AND HINDU JEWISH
AND MUSLIM
AND YES WE KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM ARE GAY
STARTING THIS
YEAR NO AMERICAN WILL BE FORBIDDEN FROM SERVING THE COUNTRY THEY LOVE
BECAUSE OF WHO THEY LOVE
AND WITH THAT CHANGE I CALL ON ALL OUR
COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO OPEN THEIR DOORS TO OUR MILITARY RECRUITERS AND
ROTC
IT IS TIME TO LEAVE BEHIND THE DIVISIVE BATTLES OF THE PAST
IT
IS TIME TO MOVE FORWARD AS ONE NATION
WE SHOULD HAVE NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE WORK AHEAD OF US
REFORMING OUR
SCHOOLS CHANGING THE WAY WE USE ENERGY REDUCING OUR DEFICIT NONE OF
THIS WILL BE EASY
ALL OF IT WILL TAKE TIME
AND IT WILL BE HARDER
BECAUSE WE WILL ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING THE COSTS THE DETAILS THE
LETTER OF EVERY LAW
OF COURSE SOME COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM
IF THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT WANTS A RAILROAD THEY BUILD A RAILROAD NO MATTER HOW MANY
HOMES GET BULLDOZED
IF THEY DON'T WANT A BAD STORY IN THE NEWSPAPER
IT DOESN'T GET WRITTEN
AND YET AS CONTENTIOUS AND FRUSTRATING AND MESSY AS OUR DEMOCRACY CAN
SOMETIMES BE I KNOW THERE ISN'T A PERSON HERE WHO WOULD TRADE PLACES
WITH ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENCES IN POLICY BUT WE ALL BELIEVE IN THE RIGHTS
ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT WE
BELIEVE IN THE SAME PROMISE THAT SAYS THIS IS A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN
MAKE IT IF YOU TRY
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS BUT WE BELIEVE
IN THE SAME DREAM THAT SAYS THIS IS A COUNTRY WHERE ANYTHING IS
POSSIBLE NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM
THAT DREAM IS WHY I CAN STAND HERE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT
THAT DREAM IS
WHY A WORKING CLASS KID FROM SCRANTON CAN SIT BEHIND ME
LAUGHTER
THAT DREAM IS WHY SOMEONE WHO BEGAN BY SWEEPING THE FLOORS OF HIS
FATHER'S CINCINNATI BAR CAN PRESIDE AS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IN THE
GREATEST NATION ON EARTH
THAT DREAM THAT AMERICAN DREAM IS WHAT DROVE THE ALLEN BROTHERS TO
REINVENT THEIR ROOFING COMPANY FOR A NEW ERA
IT'S WHAT DROVE THOSE
STUDENTS AT FORSYTH TECH TO LEARN A NEW SKILL AND WORK TOWARDS THE
FUTURE
AND THAT DREAM IS THE STORY OF A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER NAMED
BRANDON FISHER
BRANDON STARTED A COMPANY IN BERLIN PENNSYLVANIA THAT SPECIALIZES IN
A NEW KIND OF DRILLING TECHNOLOGY
AND ONE DAY LAST SUMMER HE SAW THE
NEWS THAT HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD 33 MEN WERE TRAPPED IN A CHILEAN
MINE AND NO ONE KNEW HOW TO SAVE THEM
BUT BRANDON THOUGHT HIS COMPANY COULD HELP
AND SO HE DESIGNED A RESCUE
THAT WOULD COME TO BE KNOWN AS PLAN B
HIS EMPLOYEES WORKED AROUND THE
CLOCK TO MANUFACTURE THE NECESSARY DRILLING EQUIPMENT AND BRANDON LEFT
FOR CHILE
ALONG WITH OTHERS HE BEGAN DRILLING A 2 000 FOOT HOLE INTO THE GROUND
WORKING 3 OR 4 HOUR 3 OR 4 DAYS AT A TIME WITHOUT ANY SLEEP
THIRTY
SEVEN DAYS LATER PLAN B SUCCEEDED AND THE MINERS WERE RESCUED
BUT
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT ALL OF THE ATTENTION BRANDON WASN'T THERE WHEN
THE MINERS EMERGED
HE'D ALREADY GONE BACK HOME BACK TO WORK ON HIS
NEXT PROJECT
AND LATER ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES SAID OF THE RESCUE WE PROVED THAT
CENTER ROCK IS A LITTLE COMPANY BUT WE DO BIG THINGS
WE DO BIG THINGS
FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR FOUNDING AMERICA HAS BEEN THE STORY OF
ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO DARE TO DREAM
THAT'S HOW WE WIN THE FUTURE
WE'RE A NATION THAT SAYS I MIGHT NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT I HAVE
THIS GREAT IDEA FOR A NEW COMPANY I MIGHT NOT COME FROM A FAMILY OF
COLLEGE GRADUATES BUT I WILL BE THE FIRST TO GET MY DEGREE I MIGHT
NOT KNOW THOSE PEOPLE IN TROUBLE BUT I THINK I CAN HELP THEM AND I
NEED TO TRY I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'LL REACH THAT BETTER PLACE BEYOND
THE HORIZON BUT I KNOW WE'LL GET THERE
I KNOW WE WILL
WE DO BIG THINGS
THE IDEA OF AMERICA ENDURES
OUR DESTINY REMAINS OUR CHOICE
AND
TONIGHT MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES LATER IT'S BECAUSE OF OUR PEOPLE THAT
OUR FUTURE IS HOPEFUL OUR JOURNEY GOES FORWARD AND THE STATE OF OUR
UNION IS STRONG
THANK YOU
GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA
ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
BARACK OBAMA
JANUARY 24 2012
MR
SPEAKER MR
VICE PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DISTINGUISHED
GUESTS AND FELLOW AMERICANS LAST MONTH I WENT TO ANDREWS AIR FORCE
BASE AND WELCOMED HOME SOME OF OUR LAST TROOPS TO SERVE IN IRAQ
TOGETHER WE OFFERED A FINAL PROUD SALUTE TO THE COLORS UNDER WHICH
MORE THAN A MILLION OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS FOUGHT AND SEVERAL THOUSAND
GAVE THEIR LIVES
WE GATHER TONIGHT KNOWING THAT THIS GENERATION OF HEROES HAS MADE THE
UNITED STATES SAFER AND MORE RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD
FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN 9 YEARS THERE ARE NO AMERICANS FIGHTING IN IRAQ
FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN TWO DECADES USAMA BIN LADEN IS NOT A THREAT TO THIS COUNTRY
MOST OF AL QAIDA'S TOP LIEUTENANTS HAVE BEEN DEFEATED
THE TALIBAN'S
MOMENTUM HAS BEEN BROKEN AND SOME TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEGUN TO
COME HOME
THESE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE A TESTAMENT TO THE COURAGE SELFLESSNESS AND
TEAMWORK OF AMERICA'S ARMED FORCES
AT A TIME WHEN TOO MANY OF OUR
INSTITUTIONS HAVE LET US DOWN THEY EXCEED ALL EXPECTATIONS
THEY'RE
NOT CONSUMED WITH PERSONAL AMBITION
THEY DON'T OBSESS OVER THEIR
DIFFERENCES
THEY FOCUS ON THE MISSION AT HAND
THEY WORK TOGETHER
IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH IF WE FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE
THINK
ABOUT THE AMERICA WITHIN OUR REACH A COUNTRY THAT LEADS THE WORLD IN
EDUCATING ITS PEOPLE AN AMERICA THAT ATTRACTS A NEW GENERATION OF
HIGH TECH MANUFACTURING AND HIGH PAYING JOBS A FUTURE WHERE WE'RE IN
CONTROL OF OUR OWN ENERGY AND OUR SECURITY AND PROSPERITY AREN'T SO
TIED TO UNSTABLE PARTS OF THE WORLD AN ECONOMY BUILT TO LAST WHERE
HARD WORK PAYS OFF AND RESPONSIBILITY IS REWARDED
WE CAN DO THIS
I KNOW WE CAN BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE
AT THE END
OF WORLD WAR II WHEN ANOTHER GENERATION OF HEROES RETURNED HOME FROM
COMBAT THEY BUILT THE STRONGEST ECONOMY AND MIDDLE CLASS THE WORLD HAS
EVER KNOWN
MY GRANDFATHER A VETERAN OF PATTON'S ARMY GOT THE CHANCE
TO GO TO COLLEGE ON THE GI BILL
MY GRANDMOTHER WHO WORKED ON A BOMBER
ASSEMBLY LINE WAS PART OF A WORKFORCE THAT TURNED OUT THE BEST
PRODUCTS ON EARTH
THE TWO OF THEM SHARED THE OPTIMISM OF A NATION THAT HAD TRIUMPHED OVER
A DEPRESSION AND FASCISM
THEY UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE PART OF SOMETHING
LARGER THAT THEY WERE CONTRIBUTING TO A STORY OF SUCCESS THAT EVERY
AMERICAN HAD A CHANCE TO SHARE THE BASIC AMERICAN PROMISE THAT IF YOU
WORKED HARD YOU COULD DO WELL ENOUGH TO RAISE A FAMILY OWN A HOME
SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE AND PUT A LITTLE AWAY FOR RETIREMENT
THE DEFINING ISSUE OF OUR TIME IS HOW TO KEEP THAT PROMISE ALIVE
NO
CHALLENGE IS MORE URGENT
NO DEBATE IS MORE IMPORTANT
WE CAN EITHER
SETTLE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE A SHRINKING NUMBER OF PEOPLE DO REALLY WELL
WHILE A GROWING NUMBER OF AMERICANS BARELY GET BY
OR WE CAN RESTORE AN
ECONOMY WHERE EVERYONE GETS A FAIR SHOT AND EVERYONE DOES THEIR FAIR
SHARE AND EVERYONE PLAYS BY THE SAME SET OF RULES
WHAT'S AT STAKE
AREN'T DEMOCRATIC VALUES OR REPUBLICAN VALUES BUT AMERICAN VALUES
AND
WE HAVE TO RECLAIM THEM
LET'S REMEMBER HOW WE GOT HERE
LONG BEFORE THE RECESSION JOBS AND
MANUFACTURING BEGAN LEAVING OUR SHORES
TECHNOLOGY MADE BUSINESSES MORE
EFFICIENT BUT ALSO MADE SOME JOBS OBSOLETE
FOLKS AT THE TOP SAW THEIR
INCOMES RISE LIKE NEVER BEFORE BUT MOST HARD WORKING AMERICANS
STRUGGLED WITH COSTS THAT WERE GROWING PAYCHECKS THAT WEREN'T AND
PERSONAL DEBT THAT KEPT PILING UP
IN 2008 THE HOUSE OF CARDS COLLAPSED
WE LEARNED THAT MORTGAGES HAD
BEEN SOLD TO PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T AFFORD OR UNDERSTAND THEM
BANKS HAD
MADE HUGE BETS AND BONUSES WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY
REGULATORS HAD
LOOKED THE OTHER WAY OR DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO STOP THE BAD
BEHAVIOR
IT WAS WRONG IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE AND IT PLUNGED OUR ECONOMY INTO A
CRISIS THAT PUT MILLIONS OUT OF WORK SADDLED US WITH MORE DEBT AND
LEFT INNOCENT HARD WORKING AMERICANS HOLDING THE BAG
IN THE 6 MONTHS
BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE WE LOST NEARLY 4 MILLION JOBS
AND WE LOST
ANOTHER 4 MILLION BEFORE OUR POLICIES WERE IN FULL EFFECT
THOSE ARE THE FACTS
BUT SO ARE THESE IN THE LAST 22 MONTHS
BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED MORE THAN 3 MILLION JOBS
LAST YEAR THEY
CREATED THE MOST JOBS SINCE 2005
AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS ARE HIRING
AGAIN CREATING JOBS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE LATE 1990S
TOGETHER
WE'VE AGREED TO CUT THE DEFICIT BY MORE THAN 2 TRILLION
AND WE'VE PUT
IN PLACE NEW RULES TO HOLD WALL STREET ACCOUNTABLE SO A CRISIS LIKE
THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN
THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS GETTING STRONGER
AND WE'VE COME TOO FAR TO
TURN BACK NOW
AS LONG AS I'M PRESIDENT I WILL WORK WITH ANYONE IN
THIS CHAMBER TO BUILD ON THIS MOMENTUM
BUT I INTEND TO FIGHT
OBSTRUCTION WITH ACTION AND I WILL OPPOSE ANY EFFORT TO RETURN TO THE
VERY SAME POLICIES THAT BROUGHT ON THIS ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE FIRST
PLACE
NO WE WILL NOT GO BACK TO AN ECONOMY WEAKENED BY OUTSOURCING BAD DEBT
AND PHONY FINANCIAL PROFITS
TONIGHT I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT HOW WE MOVE
FORWARD AND LAY OUT A BLUEPRINT FOR AN ECONOMY THAT'S BUILT TO LAST AN
ECONOMY BUILT ON AMERICAN MANUFACTURING AMERICAN ENERGY SKILLS FOR
AMERICAN WORKERS AND A RENEWAL OF AMERICAN VALUES
NOW THIS BLUEPRINT BEGINS WITH AMERICAN MANUFACTURING
ON THE DAY I TOOK OFFICE OUR AUTO INDUSTRY WAS ON THE VERGE OF
COLLAPSE
SOME EVEN SAID WE SHOULD LET IT DIE
WITH A MILLION JOBS AT
STAKE I REFUSED TO LET THAT HAPPEN
IN EXCHANGE FOR HELP WE DEMANDED
RESPONSIBILITY
WE GOT WORKERS AND AUTOMAKERS TO SETTLE THEIR
DIFFERENCES
WE GOT THE INDUSTRY TO RETOOL AND RESTRUCTURE
TODAY
GENERAL MOTORS IS BACK ON TOP AS THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE AUTOMAKER
CHRYSLER HAS GROWN FASTER IN THE U S
THAN ANY MAJOR CAR COMPANY
FORD
IS INVESTING BILLIONS IN U S
PLANTS AND FACTORIES
AND TOGETHER THE
ENTIRE INDUSTRY ADDED NEARLY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND JOBS
WE BET ON AMERICAN WORKERS
WE BET ON AMERICAN INGENUITY
AND TONIGHT
THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY IS BACK
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN DETROIT CAN HAPPEN IN OTHER INDUSTRIES
IT CAN
HAPPEN IN CLEVELAND AND PITTSBURGH AND RALEIGH
WE CAN'T BRING EVERY
JOB BACK THAT'S LEFT OUR SHORE
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S GETTING MORE
EXPENSIVE TO DO BUSINESS IN PLACES LIKE CHINA
MEANWHILE AMERICA IS
MORE PRODUCTIVE
A FEW WEEKS AGO THE CEO OF MASTER LOCK TOLD ME THAT
IT NOW MAKES BUSINESS SENSE FOR HIM TO BRING JOBS BACK HOME
TODAY FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN 15 YEARS MASTER LOCK'S UNIONIZED PLANT IN MILWAUKEE
IS RUNNING AT FULL CAPACITY
SO WE HAVE A HUGE OPPORTUNITY AT THIS MOMENT TO BRING MANUFACTURING
BACK
BUT WE HAVE TO SEIZE IT
TONIGHT MY MESSAGE TO BUSINESS LEADERS
IS SIMPLE ASK YOURSELVES WHAT YOU CAN DO TO BRING JOBS BACK TO YOUR
COUNTRY AND YOUR COUNTRY WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP YOU SUCCEED
WE SHOULD START WITH OUR TAX CODE
RIGHT NOW COMPANIES GET TAX BREAKS
FOR MOVING JOBS AND PROFITS OVERSEAS
MEANWHILE COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE
TO STAY IN AMERICA GET HIT WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST TAX RATES IN THE
WORLD
IT MAKES NO SENSE AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT
SO LET'S CHANGE IT
FIRST IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS THAT WANTS TO OUTSOURCE JOBS YOU SHOULDN'T
GET A TAX DEDUCTION FOR DOING IT
THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED TO COVER
MOVING EXPENSES FOR COMPANIES LIKE MASTER LOCK THAT DECIDE TO BRING
JOBS HOME
SECOND NO AMERICAN COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID PAYING ITS FAIR
SHARE OF TAXES BY MOVING JOBS AND PROFITS OVERSEAS
FROM NOW ON EVERY
MULTINATIONAL COMPANY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY A BASIC MINIMUM TAX
AND EVERY
PENNY SHOULD GO TOWARDS LOWERING TAXES FOR COMPANIES THAT CHOOSE TO
STAY HERE AND HIRE HERE IN AMERICA
THIRD IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN MANUFACTURER YOU SHOULD GET A BIGGER TAX
CUT
IF YOU'RE A HIGH TECH MANUFACTURER WE SHOULD DOUBLE THE TAX
DEDUCTION YOU GET FOR MAKING YOUR PRODUCTS HERE
AND IF YOU WANT TO
RELOCATE IN A COMMUNITY THAT WAS HIT HARD WHEN A FACTORY LEFT TOWN YOU
SHOULD GET HELP FINANCING A NEW PLANT EQUIPMENT OR TRAINING FOR NEW
WORKERS
SO MY MESSAGE IS SIMPLE IT IS TIME TO STOP REWARDING BUSINESSES THAT
SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS AND START REWARDING COMPANIES THAT CREATE JOBS
RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA
SEND ME THESE TAX REFORMS AND I WILL SIGN THEM
RIGHT AWAY
WE'RE ALSO MAKING IT EASIER FOR AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO SELL PRODUCTS
ALL OVER THE WORLD
TWO YEARS AGO I SET A GOAL OF DOUBLING U S
EXPORTS OVER 5 YEARS
WITH THE BIPARTISAN TRADE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED
INTO LAW WE'RE ON TRACK TO MEET THAT GOAL AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
AND SOON
THERE WILL BE MILLIONS OF NEW CUSTOMERS FOR AMERICAN GOODS IN PANAMA
COLOMBIA AND SOUTH KOREA
SOON THERE WILL BE NEW CARS ON THE STREETS
OF SEOUL IMPORTED FROM DETROIT AND TOLEDO AND CHICAGO
I WILL GO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD TO OPEN NEW MARKETS FOR AMERICAN
PRODUCTS
AND I WILL NOT STAND BY WHEN OUR COMPETITORS DON'T PLAY BY
THE RULES
WE'VE BROUGHT TRADE CASES AGAINST CHINA AT NEARLY TWICE THE
RATE AS THE LAST ADMINISTRATION AND IT'S MADE A DIFFERENCE
OVER A
THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY BECAUSE WE STOPPED A SURGE IN
CHINESE TIRES
BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE
IT'S NOT RIGHT WHEN ANOTHER
COUNTRY LETS OUR MOVIES MUSIC AND SOFTWARE BE PIRATED
IT'S NOT FAIR
WHEN FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS HAVE A LEG UP ON OURS ONLY BECAUSE THEY'RE
HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED
TONIGHT I'M ANNOUNCING THE CREATION OF A TRADE ENFORCEMENT UNIT THAT
WILL BE CHARGED WITH INVESTIGATING UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES IN
COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA
THERE WILL BE MORE INSPECTIONS TO PREVENT
COUNTERFEIT OR UNSAFE GOODS FROM CROSSING OUR BORDERS
AND THIS
CONGRESS SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT NO FOREIGN COMPANY HAS AN ADVANTAGE OVER
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESSING FINANCING OR NEW
MARKETS LIKE RUSSIA
OUR WORKERS ARE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE ON EARTH AND
IF THE PLAYING FIELD IS LEVEL I PROMISE YOU AMERICA WILL ALWAYS WIN
I ALSO HEAR FROM MANY BUSINESS LEADERS WHO WANT TO HIRE IN THE UNITED
STATES BUT CAN'T FIND WORKERS WITH THE RIGHT SKILLS
GROWING
INDUSTRIES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE TWICE AS MANY OPENINGS AS WE
HAVE WORKERS WHO CAN DO THE JOB
THINK ABOUT THAT OPENINGS AT A TIME
WHEN MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE LOOKING FOR WORK
IT'S INEXCUSABLE AND
WE KNOW HOW TO FIX IT
JACKIE BRAY IS A SINGLE MOM FROM NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS LAID OFF FROM
HER JOB AS A MECHANIC
THEN SIEMENS OPENED A GAS TURBINE FACTORY IN
CHARLOTTE AND FORMED A PARTNERSHIP WITH CENTRAL PIEDMONT COMMUNITY
COLLEGE
THE COMPANY HELPED THE COLLEGE DESIGN COURSES IN LASER AND
ROBOTICS TRAINING
IT PAID JACKIE'S TUITION THEN HIRED HER TO HELP
OPERATE THEIR PLANT
I WANT EVERY AMERICAN LOOKING FOR WORK TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS
JACKIE DID
JOIN ME IN A NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO TRAIN 2 MILLION
AMERICANS WITH SKILLS THAT WILL LEAD DIRECTLY TO A JOB
MY
ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY LINED UP MORE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO HELP
MODEL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN BUSINESSES LIKE SIEMENS AND COMMUNITY
COLLEGES IN PLACES LIKE CHARLOTTE AND ORLANDO AND LOUISVILLE ARE UP AND
RUNNING
NOW YOU NEED TO GIVE MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE RESOURCES
THEY NEED TO BECOME COMMUNITY CAREER CENTERS PLACES THAT TEACH PEOPLE
SKILLS THAT BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW FROM DATA MANAGEMENT
TO HIGH TECH MANUFACTURING
AND I WANT TO CUT THROUGH THE MAZE OF CONFUSING TRAINING PROGRAMS SO
THAT FROM NOW ON PEOPLE LIKE JACKIE HAVE ONE PROGRAM ONE WEB SITE
AND ONE PLACE TO GO FOR ALL THE INFORMATION AND HELP THAT THEY NEED
IT
IS TIME TO TURN OUR UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM INTO A REEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM THAT
PUTS PEOPLE TO WORK
THESE REFORMS WILL HELP PEOPLE GET JOBS THAT ARE OPEN TODAY
BUT TO
PREPARE FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW OUR COMMITMENT TO SKILLS AND
EDUCATION HAS TO START EARLIER
FOR LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF WHAT OUR NATION SPENDS ON EDUCATION EACH
YEAR WE'VE CONVINCED NEARLY EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO RAISE THEIR
STANDARDS FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED IN
A GENERATION
BUT CHALLENGES REMAIN AND WE KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THEM
AT A TIME WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOUBLING DOWN ON EDUCATION TIGHT
BUDGETS HAVE FORCED STATES TO LAY OFF THOUSANDS OF TEACHERS
WE KNOW A
GOOD TEACHER CAN INCREASE THE LIFETIME INCOME OF A CLASSROOM BY OVER
250 000
A GREAT TEACHER CAN OFFER AN ESCAPE FROM POVERTY TO THE CHILD
WHO DREAMS BEYOND HIS CIRCUMSTANCE
EVERY PERSON IN THIS CHAMBER CAN
POINT TO A TEACHER WHO CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES
MOST
TEACHERS WORK TIRELESSLY WITH MODEST PAY SOMETIMES DIGGING INTO THEIR
OWN POCKET FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES JUST TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE
TEACHERS MATTER
SO INSTEAD OF BASHING THEM OR DEFENDING THE STATUS QUO
LET'S OFFER SCHOOLS A DEAL
GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO KEEP GOOD
TEACHERS ON THE JOB AND REWARD THE BEST ONES
AND IN RETURN GRANT
SCHOOLS FLEXIBILITY TO TEACH WITH CREATIVITY AND PASSION TO STOP
TEACHING TO THE TEST AND TO REPLACE TEACHERS WHO JUST AREN'T HELPING
KIDS LEARN
THAT'S A BARGAIN WORTH MAKING
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN STUDENTS DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THEIR EDUCATION
MORE OF THEM WALK THE STAGE TO GET THEIR DIPLOMA
WHEN STUDENTS ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO DROP OUT THEY DO BETTER
SO TONIGHT I AM PROPOSING THAT
EVERY STATE EVERY STATE REQUIRES THAT ALL STUDENTS STAY IN HIGH SCHOOL
UNTIL THEY GRADUATE OR TURN 18
WHEN KIDS DO GRADUATE THE MOST DAUNTING CHALLENGE CAN BE THE COST OF
COLLEGE
AT A TIME WHEN AMERICANS OWE MORE IN TUITION DEBT THAN CREDIT
CARD DEBT THIS CONGRESS NEEDS TO STOP THE INTEREST RATES ON STUDENT
LOANS FROM DOUBLING IN JULY
EXTEND THE TUITION TAX CREDIT WE STARTED THAT SAVES MILLIONS OF MIDDLE
CLASS FAMILIES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND GIVE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE THE
CHANCE TO EARN THEIR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE BY DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF
WORK STUDY JOBS IN THE NEXT 5 YEARS
OF COURSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR US TO INCREASE STUDENT AID
WE CAN'T
JUST KEEP SUBSIDIZING SKYROCKETING TUITION WE'LL RUN OUT OF MONEY
STATES ALSO NEED TO DO THEIR PART BY MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION A HIGHER
PRIORITY IN THEIR BUDGETS
AND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE TO DO
THEIR PART BY WORKING TO KEEP COSTS DOWN
RECENTLY I SPOKE WITH A GROUP OF COLLEGE PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE DONE JUST
THAT
SOME SCHOOLS REDESIGN COURSES TO HELP STUDENTS FINISH MORE
QUICKLY
SOME USE BETTER TECHNOLOGY
THE POINT IS IT'S POSSIBLE
SO
LET ME PUT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ON NOTICE IF YOU CAN'T STOP
TUITION FROM GOING UP THE FUNDING YOU GET FROM TAXPAYERS WILL GO DOWN
HIGHER EDUCATION CAN'T BE A LUXURY
IT IS AN ECONOMIC IMPERATIVE THAT
EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICA SHOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD
LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TALENTED HARD
WORKING STUDENTS IN THIS COUNTRY FACE ANOTHER CHALLENGE THE FACT THAT
THEY AREN'T YET AMERICAN CITIZENS
MANY WERE BROUGHT HERE AS SMALL
CHILDREN ARE AMERICAN THROUGH AND THROUGH YET THEY LIVE EVERY DAY
WITH THE THREAT OF DEPORTATION
OTHERS CAME MORE RECENTLY TO STUDY
BUSINESS AND SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING BUT AS SOON AS THEY GET THEIR
DEGREE WE SEND THEM HOME TO INVENT NEW PRODUCTS AND CREATE NEW JOBS
SOMEWHERE ELSE
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
I BELIEVE AS STRONGLY AS EVER THAT WE SHOULD TAKE ON ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION
THAT'S WHY MY ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT MORE BOOTS ON THE
BORDER THAN EVER BEFORE
THAT'S WHY THERE ARE FEWER ILLEGAL CROSSINGS
THAN WHEN I TOOK OFFICE
THE OPPONENTS OF ACTION ARE OUT OF EXCUSES
WE
SHOULD BE WORKING ON COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM RIGHT NOW
BUT IF ELECTION YEAR POLITICS KEEPS CONGRESS FROM ACTING ON A
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN LET'S AT LEAST AGREE TO STOP EXPELLING RESPONSIBLE
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STAFF OUR LABS START NEW BUSINESSES DEFEND
THIS COUNTRY
SEND ME A LAW THAT GIVES THEM THE CHANCE TO EARN THEIR
CITIZENSHIP
I WILL SIGN IT RIGHT AWAY
YOU SEE AN ECONOMY BUILT TO LAST IS ONE WHERE WE ENCOURAGE THE TALENT
AND INGENUITY OF EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY
THAT MEANS WOMEN SHOULD
EARN EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
IT MEANS WE SHOULD SUPPORT EVERYONE
WHO'S WILLING TO WORK AND EVERY RISK TAKER AND ENTREPRENEUR WHO ASPIRES
TO BECOME THE NEXT STEVE JOBS
AFTER ALL INNOVATION IS WHAT AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT
MOST NEW
JOBS ARE CREATED IN STARTUPS AND SMALL BUSINESSES
SO LET'S PASS AN
AGENDA THAT HELPS THEM SUCCEED
TEAR DOWN REGULATIONS THAT PREVENT
ASPIRING ENTREPRENEURS FROM GETTING THE FINANCING TO GROW
EXPAND TAX
RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE RAISING WAGES AND CREATING GOOD
JOBS
BOTH PARTIES AGREE ON THESE IDEAS
SO PUT THEM IN A BILL AND GET
IT ON MY DESK THIS YEAR
INNOVATION ALSO DEMANDS BASIC RESEARCH
TODAY THE DISCOVERIES TAKING
PLACE IN OUR FEDERALLY FINANCED LABS AND UNIVERSITIES COULD LEAD TO NEW
TREATMENTS THAT KILL CANCER CELLS BUT LEAVE HEALTHY ONES UNTOUCHED
NEW LIGHTWEIGHT VESTS FOR COPS AND SOLDIERS THAT CAN STOP ANY BULLET
DON'T GUT THESE INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUDGET
DON'T LET OTHER COUNTRIES
WIN THE RACE FOR THE FUTURE
SUPPORT THE SAME KIND OF RESEARCH AND
INNOVATION THAT LED TO THE COMPUTER CHIP AND THE INTERNET TO NEW
AMERICAN JOBS AND NEW AMERICAN INDUSTRIES
AND NOWHERE IS THE PROMISE OF INNOVATION GREATER THAN IN AMERICAN MADE
ENERGY
OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS WE'VE OPENED MILLIONS OF NEW ACRES FOR
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND TONIGHT I'M DIRECTING MY ADMINISTRATION TO
OPEN MORE THAN 75 PERCENT OF OUR POTENTIAL OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS
RESOURCES
RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW AMERICAN OIL PRODUCTION IS THE HIGHEST
THAT IT'S BEEN IN 8 YEARS
THAT'S RIGHT 8 YEARS
NOT ONLY THAT LAST
YEAR WE RELIED LESS ON FOREIGN OIL THAN IN ANY OF THE PAST 16 YEARS
BUT WITH ONLY 2 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S OIL RESERVES OIL ISN'T ENOUGH
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS AN ALL OUT ALL OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY THAT DEVELOPS
EVERY AVAILABLE SOURCE OF AMERICAN ENERGY A STRATEGY THAT'S CLEANER
CHEAPER AND FULL OF NEW JOBS
WE HAVE A SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS THAT CAN LAST AMERICA NEARLY 100 YEARS
AND MY ADMINISTRATION WILL TAKE EVERY POSSIBLE ACTION TO SAFELY DEVELOP
THIS ENERGY
EXPERTS BELIEVE THIS WILL SUPPORT MORE THAN 600 000 JOBS
BY THE END OF THE DECADE
AND I'M REQUIRING ALL COMPANIES THAT DRILL
FOR GAS ON PUBLIC LANDS TO DISCLOSE THE CHEMICALS THEY USE
BECAUSE
AMERICA WILL DEVELOP THIS RESOURCE WITHOUT PUTTING THE HEALTH AND
SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS AT RISK
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL GAS WILL CREATE JOBS AND POWER TRUCKS AND
FACTORIES THAT ARE CLEANER AND CHEAPER PROVING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO
CHOOSE BETWEEN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR ECONOMY
AND BY THE WAY IT WAS
PUBLIC RESEARCH DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF 30 YEARS THAT HELPED
DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGIES TO EXTRACT ALL THIS NATURAL GAS OUT OF SHALE
ROCK REMINDING US THAT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IS CRITICAL IN HELPING
BUSINESSES GET NEW ENERGY IDEAS OFF THE GROUND
NOW WHAT'S TRUE FOR NATURAL GAS IS JUST AS TRUE FOR CLEAN ENERGY
IN 3
YEARS OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS ALREADY POSITIONED
AMERICA TO BE THE WORLD'S LEADING MANUFACTURER OF HIGH TECH BATTERIES
BECAUSE OF FEDERAL INVESTMENTS RENEWABLE ENERGY USE HAS NEARLY DOUBLED
AND THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS HAVE JOBS BECAUSE OF IT
WHEN BRYAN RITTERBY WAS LAID OFF FROM HIS JOB MAKING FURNITURE HE SAID
HE WORRIED THAT AT 55 NO ONE WOULD GIVE HIM A SECOND CHANCE
BUT HE
FOUND WORK AT ENERGETX A WIND TURBINE MANUFACTURER IN MICHIGAN
BEFORE
THE RECESSION THE FACTORY ONLY MADE LUXURY YACHTS
TODAY IT'S HIRING
WORKERS LIKE BRYAN WHO SAID I'M PROUD TO BE WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY
OF THE FUTURE
OUR EXPERIENCE WITH SHALE GAS OUR EXPERIENCE WITH NATURAL GAS SHOWS
US THAT THE PAYOFFS ON THESE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS DON'T ALWAYS COME RIGHT
AWAY
SOME TECHNOLOGIES DON'T PAN OUT SOME COMPANIES FAIL
BUT I WILL
NOT WALK AWAY FROM THE PROMISE OF CLEAN ENERGY
I WILL NOT WALK AWAY
FROM WORKERS LIKE BRYAN
I WILL NOT CEDE THE WIND OR SOLAR OR BATTERY
INDUSTRY TO CHINA OR GERMANY BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO MAKE THE SAME
COMMITMENT HERE
WE'VE SUBSIDIZED OIL COMPANIES FOR A CENTURY
THAT'S LONG ENOUGH
IT'S
TIME TO END THE TAXPAYER GIVEAWAYS TO AN INDUSTRY THAT RARELY HAS BEEN
MORE PROFITABLE AND DOUBLE DOWN ON A CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY THAT NEVER
HAS BEEN MORE PROMISING
PASS CLEAN ENERGY TAX CREDITS
CREATE THESE
JOBS
WE CAN ALSO SPUR ENERGY INNOVATION WITH NEW INCENTIVES
THE DIFFERENCES
IN THIS CHAMBER MAY BE TOO DEEP RIGHT NOW TO PASS A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE
BUT THERE'S NO REASON WHY CONGRESS SHOULDN'T
AT LEAST SET A CLEAN ENERGY STANDARD THAT CREATES A MARKET FOR
INNOVATION
SO FAR YOU HAVEN'T ACTED
WELL TONIGHT I WILL
I'M
DIRECTING MY ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY ON
ENOUGH PUBLIC LAND TO POWER 3 MILLION HOMES
AND I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE WORKING WITH US THE WORLD'S LARGEST
CONSUMER OF ENERGY WILL MAKE ONE OF THE LARGEST COMMITMENTS TO CLEAN
ENERGY IN HISTORY WITH THE NAVY PURCHASING ENOUGH CAPACITY TO POWER A
QUARTER OF A MILLION HOMES A YEAR
OF COURSE THE EASIEST WAY TO SAVE MONEY IS TO WASTE LESS ENERGY
SO
HERE'S A PROPOSAL HELP MANUFACTURERS ELIMINATE ENERGY WASTE IN THEIR
FACTORIES AND GIVE BUSINESSES INCENTIVES TO UPGRADE THEIR BUILDINGS
THEIR ENERGY BILLS WILL BE A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS LOWER OVER THE
NEXT DECADE AND AMERICA WILL HAVE LESS POLLUTION MORE MANUFACTURING
MORE JOBS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO NEED THEM
SEND ME A BILL THAT
CREATES THESE JOBS
BUILDING THIS NEW ENERGY FUTURE SHOULD BE JUST ONE PART OF A BROADER
AGENDA TO REPAIR AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE
SO MUCH OF AMERICA NEEDS TO
BE REBUILT
WE'VE GOT CRUMBLING ROADS AND BRIDGES A POWER GRID THAT
WASTES TOO MUCH ENERGY AN INCOMPLETE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND NETWORK THAT
PREVENTS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN RURAL AMERICA FROM SELLING HER
PRODUCTS ALL OVER THE WORLD
DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION AMERICA BUILT THE HOOVER DAM AND THE
GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
AFTER WORLD WAR II WE CONNECTED OUR STATES WITH A
SYSTEM OF HIGHWAYS
DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS INVESTED
IN GREAT PROJECTS THAT BENEFITED EVERYBODY FROM THE WORKERS WHO BUILT
THEM TO THE BUSINESSES THAT STILL USE THEM TODAY
IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS I WILL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER CLEARING AWAY THE
REDTAPE THAT SLOWS DOWN TOO MANY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
BUT YOU NEED TO
FUND THESE PROJECTS
TAKE THE MONEY WE'RE NO LONGER SPENDING AT WAR
USE HALF OF IT TO PAY DOWN OUR DEBT AND USE THE REST TO DO SOME
NATION BUILDING RIGHT HERE AT HOME
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO BUILD ESPECIALLY SINCE THE
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT WHEN THE HOUSING
BUBBLE BURST
OF COURSE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO
WERE HURT
SO WERE MILLIONS OF INNOCENT AMERICANS WHO'VE SEEN THEIR
HOME VALUES DECLINE
AND WHILE GOVERNMENT CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM ON ITS
OWN RESPONSIBLE HOMEOWNERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SIT AND WAIT FOR THE
HOUSING MARKET TO HIT BOTTOM TO GET SOME RELIEF
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SENDING THIS CONGRESS A PLAN THAT GIVES EVERY
RESPONSIBLE HOMEOWNER THE CHANCE TO SAVE ABOUT 3 000 A YEAR ON THEIR
MORTGAGE BY REFINANCING AT HISTORICALLY LOW RATES
NO MORE REDTAPE
NO
MORE RUNAROUND FROM THE BANKS
A SMALL FEE ON THE LARGEST FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS WILL ENSURE THAT IT WON'T ADD TO THE DEFICIT AND WILL GIVE
THOSE BANKS THAT WERE RESCUED BY TAXPAYERS A CHANCE TO REPAY A DEFICIT
OF TRUST
LET'S NEVER FORGET MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO WORK HARD AND PLAY BY THE
RULES EVERY DAY DESERVE A GOVERNMENT AND A FINANCIAL SYSTEM THAT DO THE
SAME
IT'S TIME TO APPLY THE SAME RULES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
NO BAILOUTS
NO HANDOUTS AND NO COPOUTS
AN AMERICA BUILT TO LAST INSISTS ON
RESPONSIBILITY FROM EVERYBODY
WE'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE FOR LENDERS WHO SOLD MORTGAGES TO PEOPLE WHO
COULDN'T AFFORD THEM AND BUYERS WHO KNEW THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THEM
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SMART REGULATIONS TO PREVENT IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR
RULES TO PREVENT FINANCIAL FRAUD OR TOXIC DUMPING OR FAULTY MEDICAL
DEVICES THESE DON'T DESTROY THE FREE MARKET
THEY MAKE THE FREE MARKET
WORK BETTER
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT SOME REGULATIONS ARE OUTDATED UNNECESSARY OR
TOO COSTLY
IN FACT I'VE APPROVED FEWER REGULATIONS IN THE FIRST 3
YEARS OF MY PRESIDENCY THAN MY REPUBLICAN PREDECESSOR DID IN HIS
I'VE
ORDERED EVERY FEDERAL AGENCY TO ELIMINATE RULES THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE
WE'VE ALREADY ANNOUNCED OVER 500 REFORMS AND JUST A FRACTION OF THEM
WILL SAVE BUSINESS AND CITIZENS MORE THAN 10 BILLION OVER THE NEXT 5
YEARS
WE GOT RID OF ONE RULE FROM 40 YEARS AGO THAT COULD HAVE FORCED
SOME DAIRY FARMERS TO SPEND 10 000 A YEAR PROVING THAT THEY COULD
CONTAIN A SPILL BECAUSE MILK WAS SOMEHOW CLASSIFIED AS AN OIL
WITH A
RULE LIKE THAT I GUESS IT WAS WORTH CRYING OVER SPILLED MILK
LAUGHTER
NOW I'M CONFIDENT A FARMER CAN CONTAIN A MILK SPILL WITHOUT A FEDERAL
AGENCY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER
ABSOLUTELY
BUT I WILL NOT BACK DOWN
FROM MAKING SURE AN OIL COMPANY CAN CONTAIN THE KIND OF OIL SPILL WE
SAW IN THE GULF 2 YEARS AGO
I WILL NOT BACK DOWN FROM PROTECTING OUR
KIDS FROM MERCURY POISONING OR MAKING SURE THAT OUR FOOD IS SAFE AND
OUR WATER IS CLEAN
I WILL NOT GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN HEALTH
INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD UNCHECKED POWER TO CANCEL YOUR POLICY DENY
YOUR COVERAGE OR CHARGE WOMEN DIFFERENTLY THAN MEN
AND I WILL NOT GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN WALL STREET WAS ALLOWED TO PLAY
BY ITS OWN SET OF RULES
THE NEW RULES WE PASSED RESTORE WHAT SHOULD BE
ANY FINANCIAL SYSTEM'S CORE PURPOSE GETTING FUNDING TO ENTREPRENEURS
WITH THE BEST IDEAS AND GETTING LOANS TO RESPONSIBLE FAMILIES WHO WANT
TO BUY A HOME OR START A BUSINESS OR SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE
SO IF YOU ARE A BIG BANK OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION YOU'RE NO LONGER
ALLOWED TO MAKE RISKY BETS WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS' DEPOSITS
YOU'RE
REQUIRED TO WRITE OUT A LIVING WILL THAT DETAILS EXACTLY HOW YOU'LL
PAY THE BILLS IF YOU FAIL BECAUSE THE REST OF US ARE NOT BAILING YOU
OUT EVER AGAIN
AND IF YOU'RE A MORTGAGE LENDER OR A PAYDAY LENDER OR A
CREDIT CARD COMPANY THE DAYS OF SIGNING PEOPLE UP FOR PRODUCTS THEY
CAN'T AFFORD WITH CONFUSING FORMS AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICES THOSE DAYS
ARE OVER
TODAY AMERICAN CONSUMERS FINALLY HAVE A WATCHDOG IN RICHARD
CORDRAY WITH ONE JOB TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM
WE'LL ALSO ESTABLISH A FINANCIAL CRIMES UNIT OF HIGHLY TRAINED
INVESTIGATORS TO CRACK DOWN ON LARGE SCALE FRAUD AND PROTECT PEOPLE'S
INVESTMENTS
SOME FINANCIAL FIRMS VIOLATE MAJOR ANTIFRAUD LAWS BECAUSE
THERE'S NO REAL PENALTY FOR BEING A REPEAT OFFENDER
THAT'S BAD FOR
CONSUMERS AND IT'S BAD FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF BANKERS AND FINANCIAL
SERVICE PROFESSIONALS WHO DO THE RIGHT THING
SO PASS LEGISLATION THAT
MAKES THE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD COUNT
AND TONIGHT I'M ASKING MY ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CREATE A SPECIAL UNIT OF
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AND LEADING STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EXPAND OUR
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE ABUSIVE LENDING AND PACKAGING OF RISKY
MORTGAGES THAT LED TO THE HOUSING CRISIS
THIS NEW UNIT WILL HOLD
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO BROKE THE LAW SPEED ASSISTANCE TO HOMEOWNERS
AND HELP TURN THE PAGE ON AN ERA OF RECKLESSNESS THAT HURT SO MANY
AMERICANS
NOW A RETURN TO THE AMERICAN VALUES OF FAIR PLAY AND SHARED
RESPONSIBILITY WILL HELP PROTECT OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ECONOMY
BUT IT
SHOULD ALSO GUIDE US AS WE LOOK TO PAY DOWN OUR DEBT AND INVEST IN OUR
FUTURE
RIGHT NOW OUR MOST IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS STOPPING A TAX HIKE ON A
HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION WORKING AMERICANS WHILE THE RECOVERY IS STILL
FRAGILE
PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD LOSING 40 OUT OF EACH PAYCHECK THIS YEAR
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS TO GET THIS DONE
SO LET'S AGREE RIGHT HERE
RIGHT NOW
NO SIDE ISSUES
NO DRAMA
PASS THE PAYROLL TAX CUT WITHOUT
DELAY
LET'S GET IT DONE
WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEFICIT WE'VE ALREADY AGREED TO MORE THAN 2
TRILLION IN CUTS AND SAVINGS
BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE AND THAT MEANS
MAKING CHOICES
RIGHT NOW WE'RE POISED TO SPEND NEARLY 1 TRILLION MORE
ON WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TEMPORARY TAX BREAK FOR THE WEALTHIEST 2
PERCENT OF AMERICANS
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF LOOPHOLES AND SHELTERS IN
THE TAX CODE A QUARTER OF ALL MILLIONAIRES PAY LOWER TAX RATES THAN
MILLIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEHOLDS
RIGHT NOW WARREN BUFFETT PAYS A
LOWER TAX RATE THAN HIS SECRETARY
DO WE WANT TO KEEP THESE TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS OR DO
WE WANT TO KEEP OUR INVESTMENTS IN EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE EDUCATION AND
MEDICAL RESEARCH A STRONG MILITARY AND CARE FOR OUR VETERANS BECAUSE
IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT PAYING DOWN OUR DEBT WE CAN'T DO BOTH
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT CHOICE IS
SO DO I
AS I TOLD
THE SPEAKER THIS SUMMER I'M PREPARED TO MAKE MORE REFORMS THAT REIN IN
THE LONG TERM COSTS OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND STRENGTHEN SOCIAL
SECURITY SO LONG AS THOSE PROGRAMS REMAIN A GUARANTEE OF SECURITY FOR
SENIORS
BUT IN RETURN WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR TAX CODE SO THAT PEOPLE
LIKE ME AND AN AWFUL LOT OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS PAY OUR FAIR SHARE OF
TAXES
TAX REFORM SHOULD FOLLOW THE BUFFETT RULE
IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN A
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR YOU SHOULD NOT PAY LESS THAN 30 PERCENT IN
TAXES
AND MY REPUBLICAN FRIEND TOM COBURN IS RIGHT WASHINGTON SHOULD
STOP SUBSIDIZING MILLIONAIRES
IN FACT IF YOU'RE EARNING A MILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR YOU SHOULDN'T GET SPECIAL TAX SUBSIDIES OR DEDUCTIONS
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU MAKE UNDER 250 000 A YEAR LIKE 98 PERCENT
OF AMERICAN FAMILIES YOUR TAXES SHOULDN'T GO UP
YOU'RE THE ONES
STRUGGLING WITH RISING COSTS AND STAGNANT WAGES
YOU'RE THE ONES WHO
NEED RELIEF
NOW YOU CAN CALL THIS CLASS WARFARE ALL YOU WANT
BUT ASKING A
BILLIONAIRE TO PAY AT LEAST AS MUCH AS HIS SECRETARY IN TAXES MOST
AMERICANS WOULD CALL THAT COMMON SENSE
WE DON'T BEGRUDGE FINANCIAL SUCCESS IN THIS COUNTRY
WE ADMIRE IT
WHEN
AMERICANS TALK ABOUT FOLKS LIKE ME PAYING MY FAIR SHARE OF TAXES IT'S
NOT BECAUSE THEY ENVY THE RICH
IT'S BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN
I GET A TAX BREAK I DON'T NEED AND THE COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD IT EITHER
ADDS TO THE DEFICIT OR SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE
LIKE A SENIOR ON A FIXED INCOME OR A STUDENT TRYING TO GET THROUGH
SCHOOL OR A FAMILY TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET
THAT'S NOT RIGHT
AMERICANS KNOW THAT'S NOT RIGHT
THEY KNOW THAT THIS GENERATION'S
SUCCESS IS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE PAST GENERATIONS FELT A RESPONSIBILITY
TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY AND THEY KNOW OUR WAY
OF LIFE WILL ONLY ENDURE IF WE FEEL THAT SAME SENSE OF SHARED
RESPONSIBILITY
THAT'S HOW WE'LL REDUCE OUR DEFICIT
THAT'S AN AMERICA
BUILT TO LAST
NOW I RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE WATCHING TONIGHT HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS
ABOUT TAXES AND DEBT ENERGY AND HEALTH CARE
BUT NO MATTER WHAT PARTY
THEY BELONG TO I BET MOST AMERICANS ARE THINKING THE SAME THING RIGHT
ABOUT NOW NOTHING WILL GET DONE IN WASHINGTON THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR
OR MAYBE EVEN THE YEAR AFTER THAT BECAUSE WASHINGTON IS BROKEN
CAN YOU BLAME THEM FOR FEELING A LITTLE CYNICAL
THE GREATEST BLOW TO OUR CONFIDENCE IN OUR ECONOMY LAST YEAR DIDN'T
COME FROM EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL
IT CAME FROM A DEBATE IN
WASHINGTON OVER WHETHER THE UNITED STATES WOULD PAY ITS BILLS OR NOT
WHO BENEFITED FROM THAT FIASCO
I'VE TALKED TONIGHT ABOUT THE DEFICIT OF TRUST BETWEEN MAIN STREET AND
WALL STREET
BUT THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THIS CITY AND THE REST OF THE
COUNTRY IS AT LEAST AS BAD AND IT SEEMS TO GET WORSE EVERY YEAR
NOW SOME OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE CORROSIVE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN
POLITICS
SO TOGETHER LET'S TAKE SOME STEPS TO FIX THAT
SEND ME A
BILL THAT BANS INSIDER TRADING BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
I WILL SIGN IT
TOMORROW
LET'S LIMIT ANY ELECTED OFFICIAL FROM OWNING STOCKS IN
INDUSTRIES THEY IMPACT
LET'S MAKE SURE PEOPLE WHO BUNDLE CAMPAIGN
CONTRIBUTIONS FOR CONGRESS CAN'T LOBBY CONGRESS AND VICE VERSA AN IDEA
THAT HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AT LEAST OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON
SOME OF WHAT'S BROKEN HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY CONGRESS DOES ITS BUSINESS
THESE DAYS
A SIMPLE MAJORITY IS NO LONGER ENOUGH TO GET ANYTHING EVEN
ROUTINE BUSINESS PASSED THROUGH THE SENATE
NEITHER PARTY HAS BEEN
BLAMELESS IN THESE TACTICS
NOW BOTH PARTIES SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT
FOR STARTERS I ASK THE SENATE TO PASS A SIMPLE RULE THAT ALL JUDICIAL
AND PUBLIC SERVICE NOMINATIONS RECEIVE A SIMPLE UP OR DOWN VOTE WITHIN
90 DAYS
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ALSO NEEDS TO CHANGE
TOO OFTEN IT'S INEFFICIENT
OUTDATED AND REMOTE
THAT'S WHY I'VE ASKED THIS CONGRESS TO GRANT ME
THE AUTHORITY TO CONSOLIDATE THE FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY SO THAT OUR
GOVERNMENT IS LEANER QUICKER AND MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE
FINALLY NONE OF THIS CAN HAPPEN UNLESS WE ALSO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE
IN THIS TOWN
WE NEED TO END THE NOTION THAT THE TWO PARTIES MUST BE
LOCKED IN A PERPETUAL CAMPAIGN OF MUTUAL DESTRUCTION THAT POLITICS IS
ABOUT CLINGING TO RIGID IDEOLOGIES INSTEAD OF BUILDING CONSENSUS AROUND
COMMONSENSE IDEAS
I'M A DEMOCRAT BUT I BELIEVE WHAT REPUBLICAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN BELIEVED
THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO FOR PEOPLE ONLY WHAT THEY CANNOT DO BETTER BY
THEMSELVES AND NO MORE
THAT'S WHY MY EDUCATION REFORM OFFERS MORE
COMPETITION AND MORE CONTROL FOR SCHOOLS AND STATES
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GETTING RID OF REGULATIONS THAT DON'T WORK
THAT'S WHY OUR HEALTH CARE
LAW RELIES ON A REFORMED PRIVATE MARKET NOT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
ON THE OTHER HAND EVEN MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WHO COMPLAIN THE MOST
ABOUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING HAVE SUPPORTED FEDERALLY FINANCED ROADS AND
CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS AND FEDERAL OFFICES FOR THE FOLKS BACK HOME
THE POINT IS WE SHOULD ALL WANT A SMARTER MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT
AND WHILE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BRIDGE OUR BIGGEST PHILOSOPHICAL
DIFFERENCES THIS YEAR WE CAN MAKE REAL PROGRESS
WITH OR WITHOUT THIS
CONGRESS I WILL KEEP TAKING ACTIONS THAT HELP THE ECONOMY GROW
BUT I
CAN DO A WHOLE LOT MORE WITH YOUR HELP
BECAUSE WHEN WE ACT TOGETHER
THERE'S NOTHING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA CAN'T ACHIEVE
THAT'S THE LESSON WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR ACTIONS ABROAD OVER THE LAST
FEW YEARS
ENDING THE IRAQ WAR HAS ALLOWED US TO STRIKE DECISIVE BLOWS
AGAINST OUR ENEMIES
FROM PAKISTAN TO YEMEN THE AL QAIDA OPERATIVES
WHO REMAIN ARE SCRAMBLING KNOWING THAT THEY CAN'T ESCAPE THE REACH OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
FROM THIS POSITION OF STRENGTH WE'VE BEGUN TO WIND DOWN THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN
TEN THOUSAND OF OUR TROOPS HAVE COME HOME
TWENTY THREE
THOUSAND MORE WILL LEAVE BY THE END OF THIS SUMMER
THIS TRANSITION TO
AFGHAN LEAD WILL CONTINUE AND WE WILL BUILD AN ENDURING PARTNERSHIP
WITH AFGHANISTAN SO THAT IT IS NEVER AGAIN A SOURCE OF ATTACKS AGAINST
AMERICA
AS THE TIDE OF WAR RECEDES A WAVE OF CHANGE HAS WASHED ACROSS THE
MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA FROM TUNIS TO CAIRO FROM SANA'A TO
TRIPOLI
A YEAR AGO QADHAFI WAS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LONGEST SERVING
DICTATORS A MURDERER WITH AMERICAN BLOOD ON HIS HANDS
TODAY HE IS
GONE
AND IN SYRIA I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE ASAD REGIME WILL SOON
DISCOVER THAT THE FORCES OF CHANGE CANNOT BE REVERSED AND THAT HUMAN
DIGNITY CANNOT BE DENIED
HOW THIS INCREDIBLE TRANSFORMATION WILL END REMAINS UNCERTAIN
BUT WE
HAVE A HUGE STAKE IN THE OUTCOME
AND WHILE IT'S ULTIMATELY UP TO THE
PEOPLE OF THE REGION TO DECIDE THEIR FATE WE WILL ADVOCATE FOR THOSE
VALUES THAT HAVE SERVED OUR OWN COUNTRY SO WELL
WE WILL STAND AGAINST
VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION
WE WILL STAND FOR THE RIGHTS AND DIGNITY OF
ALL HUMAN BEINGS MEN AND WOMEN CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND JEWS
WE WILL
SUPPORT POLICIES THAT LEAD TO STRONG AND STABLE DEMOCRACIES AND OPEN
MARKETS BECAUSE TYRANNY IS NO MATCH FOR LIBERTY
AND WE WILL SAFEGUARD AMERICA'S OWN SECURITY AGAINST THOSE WHO THREATEN
OUR CITIZENS OUR FRIENDS AND OUR INTERESTS
LOOK AT IRAN
THROUGH THE
POWER OF OUR DIPLOMACY A WORLD THAT WAS ONCE DIVIDED ABOUT HOW TO DEAL
WITH IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM NOW STANDS AS ONE
THE REGIME IS MORE
ISOLATED THAN EVER BEFORE
ITS LEADERS ARE FACED WITH CRIPPLING
SANCTIONS AND AS LONG AS THEY SHIRK THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES THIS
PRESSURE WILL NOT RELENT
LET THERE BE NO DOUBT AMERICA IS DETERMINED TO PREVENT IRAN FROM
GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON AND I WILL TAKE NO OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE TO
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL
BUT A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE IS STILL
POSSIBLE AND FAR BETTER
AND IF IRAN CHANGES COURSE AND MEETS ITS
OBLIGATIONS IT CAN REJOIN THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS
THE RENEWAL OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP CAN BE FELT ACROSS THE GLOBE
OUR
OLDEST ALLIANCES IN EUROPE AND ASIA ARE STRONGER THAN EVER
OUR TIES TO
THE AMERICAS ARE DEEPER
OUR IRONCLAD COMMITMENT AND I MEAN IRONCLAD TO
ISRAEL'S SECURITY HAS MEANT THE CLOSEST MILITARY COOPERATION BETWEEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES IN HISTORY
WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR THAT AMERICA IS A PACIFIC POWER AND A NEW
BEGINNING IN BURMA HAS LIT A NEW HOPE
FROM THE COALITIONS WE'VE BUILT
TO SECURE NUCLEAR MATERIALS TO THE MISSIONS WE'VE LED AGAINST HUNGER
AND DISEASE FROM THE BLOWS WE'VE DEALT TO OUR ENEMIES TO THE ENDURING
POWER OF OUR MORAL EXAMPLE AMERICA IS BACK
ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU THAT AMERICA IS IN
DECLINE OR THAT OUR INFLUENCE HAS WANED DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT
THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE WE GET FROM LEADERS AROUND THE
WORLD WHO ARE EAGER TO WORK WITH US
THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE FEEL FROM
TOKYO TO BERLIN FROM CAPE TOWN TO RIO WHERE OPINIONS OF AMERICA ARE
HIGHER THAN THEY'VE BEEN IN YEARS
YES THE WORLD IS CHANGING
NO WE
CAN'T CONTROL EVERY EVENT
BUT AMERICA REMAINS THE ONE INDISPENSABLE
NATION IN WORLD AFFAIRS AND AS LONG AS I'M PRESIDENT I INTEND TO KEEP
IT THAT WAY
THAT'S WHY WORKING WITH OUR MILITARY LEADERS I'VE PROPOSED A NEW
DEFENSE STRATEGY THAT ENSURES WE MAINTAIN THE FINEST MILITARY IN THE
WORLD WHILE SAVING NEARLY HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET
TO
STAY ONE STEP AHEAD OF OUR ADVERSARIES I'VE ALREADY SENT THIS CONGRESS
LEGISLATION THAT WILL SECURE OUR COUNTRY FROM THE GROWING DANGERS OF
CYBER THREATS
ABOVE ALL OUR FREEDOM ENDURES BECAUSE OF THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM
WHO DEFEND IT
AS THEY COME HOME WE MUST SERVE THEM AS WELL AS THEY'VE
SERVED US
THAT INCLUDES GIVING THEM THE CARE AND THE BENEFITS THEY
HAVE EARNED WHICH IS WHY WE'VE INCREASED ANNUAL VA SPENDING EVERY YEAR
I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT
AND IT MEANS ENLISTING OUR VETERANS IN THE WORK OF
REBUILDING OUR NATION
WITH THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF THIS CONGRESS WE'RE PROVIDING NEW TAX
CREDITS TO COMPANIES THAT HIRE VETS
MICHELLE AND JILL BIDEN HAVE
WORKED WITH AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO SECURE A PLEDGE OF 135 000 JOBS FOR
VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES
AND TONIGHT I'M PROPOSING A VETERANS JOBS
CORPS THAT WILL HELP OUR COMMUNITIES HIRE VETERANS AS COPS AND
FIREFIGHTERS SO THAT AMERICA IS AS STRONG AS THOSE WHO DEFEND HER
WHICH BRINGS ME BACK TO WHERE I BEGAN
THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN SENT
HERE TO SERVE CAN LEARN A THING OR TWO FROM THE SERVICE OF OUR TROOPS
WHEN YOU PUT ON THAT UNIFORM IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE BLACK OR
WHITE ASIAN LATINO NATIVE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE LIBERAL RICH
POOR GAY STRAIGHT
WHEN YOU'RE MARCHING INTO BATTLE YOU LOOK OUT FOR
THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU OR THE MISSION FAILS
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE THICK
OF THE FIGHT YOU RISE OR FALL AS ONE UNIT SERVING ONE NATION LEAVING
NO ONE BEHIND
YOU KNOW ONE OF MY PROUDEST POSSESSIONS IS THE FLAG THAT THE SEAL TEAM
TOOK WITH THEM ON THE MISSION TO GET BIN LADEN
ON IT ARE EACH OF THEIR
NAMES
SOME MAY BE DEMOCRATS SOME MAY BE REPUBLICANS BUT THAT DOESN'T
MATTER
JUST LIKE IT DIDN'T MATTER THAT DAY IN THE SITUATION ROOM WHEN
I SAT NEXT TO BOB GATES A MAN WHO WAS GEORGE BUSH'S DEFENSE SECRETARY
AND HILLARY CLINTON A WOMAN WHO RAN AGAINST ME FOR PRESIDENT
ALL THAT MATTERED THAT DAY WAS THE MISSION
NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT
POLITICS
NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT THEMSELVES
ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN
INVOLVED IN THE RAID LATER TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN'T DESERVE CREDIT FOR
THE MISSION
IT ONLY SUCCEEDED HE SAID BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF
THAT UNIT DID THEIR JOB THE PILOT WHO LANDED THE HELICOPTER THAT SPUN
OUT OF CONTROL THE TRANSLATOR WHO KEPT OTHERS FROM ENTERING THE
COMPOUND THE TROOPS WHO SEPARATED THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN FROM THE
FIGHT THE SEALS WHO CHARGED UP THE STAIRS
MORE THAN THAT THE MISSION
ONLY SUCCEEDED BECAUSE EVERY MEMBER OF THAT UNIT TRUSTED EACH OTHER
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CHARGE UP THOSE STAIRS INTO DARKNESS AND DANGER
UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY BEHIND YOU WATCHING YOUR BACK
SO IT IS WITH AMERICA
EACH TIME I LOOK AT THAT FLAG I'M REMINDED THAT
OUR DESTINY IS STITCHED TOGETHER LIKE THOSE 50 STARS AND THOSE 13
STRIPES
NO ONE BUILT THIS COUNTRY ON THEIR OWN
THIS NATION IS GREAT
BECAUSE WE BUILT IT TOGETHER
THIS NATION IS GREAT BECAUSE WE WORKED AS
A TEAM
THIS NATION IS GREAT BECAUSE WE GET EACH OTHER'S BACKS
AND IF
WE HOLD FAST TO THAT TRUTH IN THIS MOMENT OF TRIAL THERE IS NO
CHALLENGE TOO GREAT NO MISSION TOO HARD
AS LONG AS WE ARE JOINED IN
COMMON PURPOSE AS LONG AS WE MAINTAIN OUR COMMON RESOLVE OUR JOURNEY
MOVES FORWARD AND OUR FUTURE IS HOPEFUL AND THE STATE OF OUR UNION
WILL ALWAYS BE STRONG
THANK YOU GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
BARACK OBAMA
FEBRUARY 12 2013
PLEASE EVERYBODY HAVE A SEAT
MR
SPEAKER MR
VICE PRESIDENT
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FELLOW AMERICANS FIFTY ONE YEARS AGO JOHN F
KENNEDY DECLARED TO THIS CHAMBER THAT THE CONSTITUTION MAKES US NOT
RIVALS FOR POWER BUT PARTNERS FOR PROGRESS IT IS MY TASK HE SAID
TO REPORT THE STATE OF THE UNION TO IMPROVE IT IS THE TASK OF US
ALL
TONIGHT THANKS TO THE GRIT AND DETERMINATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THERE IS MUCH PROGRESS TO REPORT
AFTER A DECADE OF GRINDING WAR OUR
BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM ARE COMING HOME
AFTER YEARS OF GRUELING
RECESSION OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED OVER 6 MILLION NEW JOBS
WE BUY
MORE AMERICAN CARS THAN WE HAVE IN 5 YEARS AND LESS FOREIGN OIL THAN WE
HAVE IN 20
OUR HOUSING MARKET IS HEALING OUR STOCK MARKET IS
REBOUNDING AND CONSUMERS PATIENTS AND HOMEOWNERS ENJOY STRONGER
PROTECTIONS THAN EVER BEFORE
SO TOGETHER WE HAVE CLEARED AWAY THE RUBBLE OF CRISIS AND WE CAN SAY
WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE THAT THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONGER
BUT WE GATHER HERE KNOWING THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHOSE
HARD WORK AND DEDICATION HAVE NOT YET BEEN REWARDED
OUR ECONOMY IS
ADDING JOBS BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE STILL CAN'T FIND FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT
CORPORATE PROFITS HAVE SKYROCKETED TO ALLTIME HIGHS BUT FOR MORE THAN
A DECADE WAGES AND INCOMES HAVE BARELY BUDGED
IT IS OUR GENERATION'S TASK THEN TO REIGNITE THE TRUE ENGINE OF
AMERICA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH A RISING THRIVING MIDDLE CLASS
IT IS OUR UNFINISHED TASK TO RESTORE THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT BUILT THIS
COUNTRY THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WORK HARD AND MEET YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
YOU CAN GET AHEAD NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM NO MATTER WHAT YOU
LOOK LIKE OR WHO YOU LOVE
IT IS OUR UNFINISHED TASK TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS GOVERNMENT WORKS ON
BEHALF OF THE MANY AND NOT JUST THE FEW THAT IT ENCOURAGES FREE
ENTERPRISE REWARDS INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE AND OPENS THE DOORS OF
OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY CHILD ACROSS THIS GREAT NATION
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM
THEY DON'T EXPECT THOSE OF US IN THIS CHAMBER TO AGREE ON EVERY ISSUE
BUT THEY DO EXPECT US TO PUT THE NATION'S INTERESTS BEFORE PARTY
THEY
DO EXPECT US TO FORGE REASONABLE COMPROMISE WHERE WE CAN
FOR THEY KNOW
THAT AMERICA MOVES FORWARD ONLY WHEN WE DO SO TOGETHER AND THAT THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF IMPROVING THIS UNION REMAINS THE TASK OF US ALL
NOW OUR WORK MUST BEGIN BY MAKING SOME BASIC DECISIONS ABOUT OUR
BUDGET DECISIONS THAT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR
RECOVERY
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BOTH PARTIES HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO REDUCE
THE DEFICIT BY MORE THAN 2 5 TRILLION MOSTLY THROUGH SPENDING CUTS
BUT ALSO BY RAISING TAX RATES ON THE WEALTHIEST 1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS
AS A RESULT WE ARE MORE THAN HALFWAY TOWARDS THE GOAL OF 4 TRILLION
IN DEFICIT REDUCTION THAT ECONOMISTS SAY WE NEED TO STABILIZE OUR
FINANCES
NOW WE NEED TO FINISH THE JOB
AND THE QUESTION IS HOW
IN 2011 CONGRESS PASSED A LAW SAYING THAT IF BOTH PARTIES COULDN'T
AGREE ON A PLAN TO REACH OUR DEFICIT GOAL ABOUT A TRILLION DOLLARS'
WORTH OF BUDGET CUTS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO INTO EFFECT THIS YEAR
THESE SUDDEN HARSH ARBITRARY CUTS WOULD JEOPARDIZE OUR MILITARY
READINESS
THEY'D DEVASTATE PRIORITIES LIKE EDUCATION AND ENERGY AND
MEDICAL RESEARCH
THEY WOULD CERTAINLY SLOW OUR RECOVERY AND COST US
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS
AND THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS
BUSINESS LEADERS AND ECONOMISTS HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THESE CUTS
KNOWN HERE IN WASHINGTON AS THE SEQUESTER ARE A REALLY BAD IDEA
NOW SOME IN CONGRESS HAVE PROPOSED PREVENTING ONLY THE DEFENSE CUTS BY
MAKING EVEN BIGGER CUTS TO THINGS LIKE EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING
MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS
THAT IDEA IS EVEN WORSE
YES THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF OUR LONG TERM DEBT IS THE RISING COST OF
HEALTH CARE FOR AN AGING POPULATION
AND THOSE OF US WHO CARE DEEPLY
ABOUT PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE MUST EMBRACE THE NEED FOR MODEST REFORMS
OTHERWISE OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAMS WILL CROWD OUT THE INVESTMENTS WE
NEED FOR OUR CHILDREN AND JEOPARDIZE THE PROMISE OF A SECURE RETIREMENT
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
BUT WE CAN'T ASK SENIOR CITIZENS AND WORKING FAMILIES TO SHOULDER THE
ENTIRE BURDEN OF DEFICIT REDUCTION WHILE ASKING NOTHING MORE FROM THE
WEALTHIEST AND THE MOST POWERFUL
WE WON'T GROW THE MIDDLE CLASS SIMPLY
BY SHIFTING THE COST OF HEALTH CARE OR COLLEGE ONTO FAMILIES THAT ARE
ALREADY STRUGGLING OR BY FORCING COMMUNITIES TO LAY OFF MORE TEACHERS
AND MORE COPS AND MORE FIREFIGHTERS
MOST AMERICANS DEMOCRATS
REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN'T JUST CUT OUR WAY
TO PROSPERITY
THEY KNOW THAT BROAD BASED ECONOMIC GROWTH REQUIRES A
BALANCED APPROACH TO DEFICIT REDUCTION WITH SPENDING CUTS AND REVENUE
AND WITH EVERYBODY DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE
AND THAT'S THE APPROACH I
OFFER TONIGHT
ON MEDICARE I'M PREPARED TO ENACT REFORMS THAT WILL ACHIEVE THE SAME
AMOUNT OF HEALTH CARE SAVINGS BY THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT DECADE AS
THE REFORMS PROPOSED BY THE BIPARTISAN SIMPSON BOWLES COMMISSION
ALREADY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS HELPING TO SLOW THE GROWTH OF
HEALTH CARE COSTS
AND THE REFORMS I'M PROPOSING GO EVEN FURTHER
WE'LL
REDUCE TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES TO PRESCRIPTION DRUG COMPANIES AND ASK MORE
FROM THE WEALTHIEST SENIORS
WE'LL BRING DOWN COSTS BY CHANGING THE WAY
OUR GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR MEDICARE BECAUSE OUR MEDICAL BILLS SHOULDN'T
BE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TESTS ORDERED OR DAYS SPENT IN THE HOSPITAL
THEY SHOULD BE BASED ON THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT OUR SENIORS RECEIVE
AND I AM OPEN TO ADDITIONAL REFORMS FROM BOTH PARTIES SO LONG AS THEY
DON'T VIOLATE THE GUARANTEE OF A SECURE RETIREMENT
OUR GOVERNMENT
SHOULDN'T MAKE PROMISES WE CANNOT KEEP BUT WE MUST KEEP THE PROMISES
WE'VE ALREADY MADE
TO HIT THE REST OF OUR DEFICIT REDUCTION TARGET WE SHOULD DO WHAT
LEADERS IN BOTH PARTIES HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED AND SAVE HUNDREDS OF
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY GETTING RID OF TAX LOOPHOLES AND DEDUCTIONS FOR
THE WELL OFF AND THE WELL CONNECTED
AFTER ALL WHY WOULD WE CHOOSE TO
MAKE DEEPER CUTS TO EDUCATION AND MEDICARE JUST TO PROTECT SPECIAL
INTEREST TAX BREAKS HOW IS THAT FAIR WHY IS IT THAT DEFICIT REDUCTION
IS A BIG EMERGENCY JUSTIFYING MAKING CUTS IN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS
BUT NOT CLOSING SOME LOOPHOLES HOW DOES THAT PROMOTE GROWTH
NOW IS OUR BEST CHANCE FOR BIPARTISAN COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM THAT
ENCOURAGES JOB CREATION AND HELPS BRING DOWN THE DEFICIT
WE CAN GET
THIS DONE
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A TAX CODE THAT HELPS SMALL
BUSINESSES SPEND LESS TIME FILLING OUT COMPLICATED FORMS AND MORE TIME
EXPANDING AND HIRING A TAX CODE THAT ENSURES BILLIONAIRES WITH HIGH
POWERED ACCOUNTANTS CAN'T WORK THE SYSTEM AND PAY A LOWER RATE THAN
THEIR HARD WORKING SECRETARIES A TAX CODE THAT LOWERS INCENTIVES TO
MOVE JOBS OVERSEAS AND LOWERS TAX RATES FOR BUSINESSES AND
MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE CREATING JOBS RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA
THAT'S WHAT TAX REFORM CAN DELIVER
THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DO
TOGETHER
I REALIZE THAT TAX REFORM AND ENTITLEMENT REFORM WILL NOT BE EASY
THE
POLITICS WILL BE HARD FOR BOTH SIDES
NONE OF US WILL GET A HUNDRED
PERCENT OF WHAT WE WANT
BUT THE ALTERNATIVE WILL COST US JOBS HURT
OUR ECONOMY VISIT HARDSHIP ON MILLIONS OF HARD WORKING AMERICANS
SO
LET'S SET PARTY INTERESTS ASIDE AND WORK TO PASS A BUDGET THAT REPLACES
RECKLESS CUTS WITH SMART SAVINGS AND WISE INVESTMENTS IN OUR FUTURE
AND LET'S DO IT WITHOUT THE BRINKSMANSHIP THAT STRESSES CONSUMERS AND
SCARES OFF INVESTORS
THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH CANNOT KEEP
CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS BY DRIFTING FROM ONE MANUFACTURED CRISIS TO THE
NEXT
WE CAN'T DO IT
LET'S AGREE RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW TO KEEP THE PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT OPEN
AND PAY OUR BILLS ON TIME AND ALWAYS UPHOLD THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE WORKED TOO
HARD FOR TOO LONG REBUILDING FROM ONE CRISIS TO SEE THEIR ELECTED
OFFICIALS CAUSE ANOTHER
NOW MOST OF US AGREE THAT A PLAN TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT MUST BE PART OF
OUR AGENDA
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR DEFICIT REDUCTION ALONE IS NOT AN
ECONOMIC PLAN
A GROWING ECONOMY THAT CREATES GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS
THAT MUST BE THE NORTH STAR THAT GUIDES OUR EFFORTS
EVERY DAY WE
SHOULD ASK OURSELVES THREE QUESTIONS AS A NATION HOW DO WE ATTRACT
MORE JOBS TO OUR SHORES HOW DO WE EQUIP OUR PEOPLE WITH THE SKILLS
THEY NEED TO GET THOSE JOBS AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT HARD WORK
LEADS TO A DECENT LIVING
NOW A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I PUT FORWARD AN AMERICAN JOBS ACT THAT
INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS SAID WOULD CREATE MORE THAN 1 MILLION NEW JOBS
AND I THANK THE LAST CONGRESS FOR PASSING SOME OF THAT AGENDA
I URGE
THIS CONGRESS TO PASS THE REST
BUT TONIGHT I'LL LAY OUT ADDITIONAL
PROPOSALS THAT ARE FULLY PAID FOR AND FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE BUDGET
FRAMEWORK BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO JUST 18 MONTHS AGO
LET ME REPEAT
NOTHING I'M PROPOSING TONIGHT SHOULD INCREASE OUR DEFICIT BY A SINGLE
DIME
IT IS NOT A BIGGER GOVERNMENT WE NEED BUT A SMARTER GOVERNMENT
THAT SETS PRIORITIES AND INVESTS IN BROAD BASED GROWTH
THAT'S WHAT WE
SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR
OUR FIRST PRIORITY IS MAKING AMERICA A MAGNET FOR NEW JOBS AND
MANUFACTURING
AFTER SHEDDING JOBS FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS OUR
MANUFACTURERS HAVE ADDED ABOUT 500 000 JOBS OVER THE PAST 3
CATERPILLAR IS BRINGING JOBS BACK FROM JAPAN
FORD IS BRINGING JOBS
BACK FROM MEXICO
AND THIS YEAR APPLE WILL START MAKING MACS IN
AMERICA AGAIN
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW TO ACCELERATE THIS TREND
LAST
YEAR WE CREATED OUR FIRST MANUFACTURING INNOVATION INSTITUTE IN
YOUNGSTOWN OHIO
A ONCE SHUTTERED WAREHOUSE IS NOW A STATE OF THE ART
LAB WHERE NEW WORKERS ARE MASTERING THE 3 D PRINTING THAT HAS THE
POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE MAKE ALMOST EVERYTHING
THERE'S
NO REASON THIS CAN'T HAPPEN IN OTHER TOWNS
SO TONIGHT I'M ANNOUNCING THE LAUNCH OF THREE MORE OF THESE
MANUFACTURING HUBS WHERE BUSINESSES WILL PARTNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT
OF DEFENSE AND ENERGY TO TURN REGIONS LEFT BEHIND BY GLOBALIZATION INTO
GLOBAL CENTERS OF HIGH TECH JOBS
AND I ASK THIS CONGRESS TO HELP
CREATE A NETWORK OF 15 OF THESE HUBS AND GUARANTEE THAT THE NEXT
REVOLUTION IN MANUFACTURING IS MADE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA
WE CAN GET
THAT DONE
NOW IF WE WANT TO MAKE THE BEST PRODUCTS WE ALSO HAVE TO INVEST IN
THE BEST IDEAS
EVERY DOLLAR WE INVESTED TO MAP THE HUMAN GENOME
RETURNED 140 TO OUR ECONOMY EVERY DOLLAR
TODAY OUR SCIENTISTS ARE
MAPPING THE HUMAN BRAIN TO UNLOCK THE ANSWERS TO ALZHEIMER'S
THEY'RE
DEVELOPING DRUGS TO REGENERATE DAMAGED ORGANS DEVISING NEW MATERIALS
TO MAKE BATTERIES 10 TIMES MORE POWERFUL
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO GUT
THESE JOB CREATING INVESTMENTS IN SCIENCE AND INNOVATION NOW IS THE
TIME TO REACH A LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT NOT SEEN SINCE THE
HEIGHT OF THE SPACE RACE
WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS
TODAY NO AREA HOLDS MORE PROMISE THAN OUR INVESTMENTS IN AMERICAN
ENERGY
AFTER YEARS OF TALKING ABOUT IT WE'RE FINALLY POISED TO
CONTROL OUR OWN ENERGY FUTURE
WE PRODUCE MORE OIL AT HOME THAN WE HAVE
IN 15 YEARS
WE HAVE DOUBLED THE DISTANCE OUR CARS WILL GO ON A GALLON
OF GAS AND THE AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WE GENERATE FROM SOURCES LIKE
WIND AND SOLAR WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GOOD AMERICAN JOBS TO SHOW
FOR IT
WE PRODUCE MORE NATURAL GAS THAN EVER BEFORE AND NEARLY
EVERYONE'S ENERGY BILL IS LOWER BECAUSE OF IT
AND OVER THE LAST 4
YEARS OUR EMISSIONS OF THE DANGEROUS CARBON POLLUTION THAT THREATENS
OUR PLANET HAVE ACTUALLY FALLEN
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FUTURE WE MUST DO MORE TO
COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE
NOW IT'S TRUE THAT NO SINGLE EVENT MAKES A
TREND
BUT THE FACT IS THE 12 HOTTEST YEARS ON RECORD HAVE ALL COME IN
THE LAST 15
HEAT WAVES DROUGHTS WILDFIRES FLOODS ALL ARE NOW MORE
FREQUENT AND MORE INTENSE
WE CAN CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT SUPERSTORM
SANDY AND THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHT IN DECADES AND THE WORST WILDFIRES
SOME STATES HAVE EVER SEEN WERE ALL JUST A FREAK COINCIDENCE
OR WE CAN
CHOOSE TO BELIEVE IN THE OVERWHELMING JUDGMENT OF SCIENCE AND ACT
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS WE CAN MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE
WHILE DRIVING STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH
I URGE THIS CONGRESS TO GET
TOGETHER PURSUE A BIPARTISAN MARKET BASED SOLUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE
LIKE THE ONE JOHN MCCAIN AND JOE LIEBERMAN WORKED ON TOGETHER A FEW
YEARS AGO
BUT IF CONGRESS WON'T ACT SOON TO PROTECT FUTURE GENERATIONS
I WILL
I WILL DIRECT MY CABINET TO COME UP WITH EXECUTIVE ACTIONS WE
CAN TAKE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE TO REDUCE POLLUTION PREPARE OUR
COMMUNITIES FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPEED THE
TRANSITION TO MORE SUSTAINABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY
AND 4 YEARS AGO OTHER COUNTRIES DOMINATED THE CLEAN ENERGY MARKET AND
THE JOBS THAT CAME WITH IT
AND WE'VE BEGUN TO CHANGE THAT
LAST YEAR
WIND ENERGY ADDED NEARLY HALF OF ALL NEW POWER CAPACITY IN AMERICA
SO
LET'S GENERATE EVEN MORE
SOLAR ENERGY GETS CHEAPER BY THE YEAR LET'S
DRIVE DOWN COSTS EVEN FURTHER
AS LONG AS COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA KEEP
GOING ALL IN ON CLEAN ENERGY SO MUST WE
NOW IN THE MEANTIME THE NATURAL GAS BOOM HAS LED TO CLEANER POWER AND
GREATER ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE THAT
AND THAT'S WHY
MY ADMINISTRATION WILL KEEP CUTTING REDTAPE AND SPEEDING UP NEW OIL AND
GAS PERMITS
THAT'S GOT TO BE PART OF AN ALL OF THE ABOVE PLAN
BUT I
ALSO WANT TO WORK WITH THIS CONGRESS TO ENCOURAGE THE RESEARCH AND
TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS NATURAL GAS BURN EVEN CLEANER AND PROTECTS OUR
AIR AND OUR WATER
IN FACT MUCH OF OUR NEW FOUND ENERGY IS DRAWN FROM LANDS AND WATERS
THAT WE THE PUBLIC OWN TOGETHER
SO TONIGHT I PROPOSE WE USE SOME OF
OUR OIL AND GAS REVENUES TO FUND AN ENERGY SECURITY TRUST THAT WILL
DRIVE NEW RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY TO SHIFT OUR CARS AND TRUCKS OFF OIL
FOR GOOD
IF A NONPARTISAN COALITION OF CEOS AND RETIRED GENERALS AND
ADMIRALS CAN GET BEHIND THIS IDEA THEN SO CAN WE
LET'S TAKE THEIR
ADVICE AND FREE OUR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES FROM THE PAINFUL SPIKES IN
GAS PRICES WE'VE PUT UP WITH FOR FAR TOO LONG
I'M ALSO ISSUING A NEW GOAL FOR AMERICA LET'S CUT IN HALF THE ENERGY
WASTED BY OUR HOMES AND BUSINESSES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS
WE'LL WORK
WITH THE STATES TO DO IT
THOSE STATES WITH THE BEST IDEAS TO CREATE
JOBS AND LOWER ENERGY BILLS BY CONSTRUCTING MORE EFFICIENT BUILDINGS
WILL RECEIVE FEDERAL SUPPORT TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN
AMERICA'S ENERGY SECTOR IS JUST ONE PART OF AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE
BADLY IN NEED OF REPAIR
ASK ANY CEO WHERE THEY'D RATHER LOCATE AND
HIRE A COUNTRY WITH DETERIORATING ROADS AND BRIDGES OR ONE WITH HIGH
SPEED RAIL AND INTERNET HIGH TECH SCHOOLS SELF HEALING POWER GRIDS
THE CEO OF SIEMENS AMERICA A COMPANY THAT BROUGHT HUNDREDS OF NEW JOBS
TO NORTH CAROLINA SAID THAT IF WE UPGRADE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE THEY'LL
BRING EVEN MORE JOBS
AND THAT'S THE ATTITUDE OF A LOT OF COMPANIES ALL
AROUND THE WORLD
AND I KNOW YOU WANT THESE JOB CREATING PROJECTS IN
YOUR DISTRICT
I'VE SEEN ALL THOSE RIBBON CUTTINGS
LAUGHTER
SO TONIGHT I PROPOSE A FIX IT FIRST PROGRAM TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE ON OUR MOST URGENT REPAIRS LIKE THE NEARLY 70 000
STRUCTURALLY DEFICIENT BRIDGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY
AND TO MAKE SURE
TAXPAYERS DON'T SHOULDER THE WHOLE BURDEN I'M ALSO PROPOSING A
PARTNERSHIP TO REBUILD AMERICA THAT ATTRACTS PRIVATE CAPITAL TO UPGRADE
WHAT OUR BUSINESSES NEED MOST MODERN PORTS TO MOVE OUR GOODS MODERN
PIPELINES TO WITHSTAND A STORM MODERN SCHOOLS WORTHY OF OUR CHILDREN
LET'S PROVE THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO DO BUSINESS THAN HERE IN THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND LET'S START RIGHT AWAY
WE CAN GET THIS
DONE
AND PART OF OUR REBUILDING EFFORT MUST ALSO INVOLVE OUR HOUSING SECTOR
THE GOOD NEWS IS OUR HOUSING MARKET IS FINALLY HEALING FROM THE
COLLAPSE OF 2007
HOME PRICES ARE RISING AT THE FASTEST PACE IN 6 YEARS
HOME PURCHASES ARE UP NEARLY 50 PERCENT AND CONSTRUCTION IS EXPANDING
AGAIN
BUT EVEN WITH MORTGAGE RATES NEAR A 50 YEAR LOW TOO MANY FAMILIES WITH
SOLID CREDIT WHO WANT TO BUY A HOME ARE BEING REJECTED
TOO MANY
FAMILIES WHO NEVER MISSED A PAYMENT AND WANT TO REFINANCE ARE BEING
TOLD NO
THAT'S HOLDING OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY BACK
WE NEED TO FIX IT
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A BILL IN THIS CONGRESS THAT WOULD GIVE EVERY
RESPONSIBLE HOMEOWNER IN AMERICA THE CHANCE TO SAVE 3 000 A YEAR BY
REFINANCING AT TODAY'S RATES
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE SUPPORTED
IT BEFORE SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR TAKE A VOTE AND SEND ME THAT
BILL
WHY ARE WHY WOULD WE BE AGAINST THAT WHY WOULD THAT BE A
PARTISAN ISSUE HELPING FOLKS REFINANCE RIGHT NOW OVERLAPPING
REGULATIONS KEEP RESPONSIBLE YOUNG FAMILIES FROM BUYING THEIR FIRST
HOME
WHAT'S HOLDING US BACK LET'S STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND HELP OUR
ECONOMY GROW
THESE INITIATIVES IN MANUFACTURING ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING
ALL THESE THINGS WILL HELP ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS
EXPAND AND CREATE NEW JOBS
BUT NONE OF IT WILL MATTER UNLESS WE ALSO
EQUIP OUR CITIZENS WITH THE SKILLS AND TRAINING TO FILL THOSE JOBS
AND THAT HAS TO START AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE AGE
STUDY AFTER STUDY
SHOWS THAT THE SOONER A CHILD BEGINS LEARNING THE BETTER HE OR SHE
DOES DOWN THE ROAD
BUT TODAY FEWER THAN 3 IN 10 4 YEAR OLDS ARE
ENROLLED IN A HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM
MOST MIDDLE CLASS PARENTS
CAN'T AFFORD A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS A WEEK FOR A PRIVATE PRESCHOOL
AND
FOR POOR KIDS WHO NEED HELP THE MOST THIS LACK OF ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL
EDUCATION CAN SHADOW THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
SO TONIGHT I
PROPOSE WORKING WITH STATES TO MAKE HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL AVAILABLE TO
EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO
EVERY DOLLAR WE INVEST IN HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CAN
SAVE MORE THAN 7 DOLLARS LATER ON BY BOOSTING GRADUATION RATES
REDUCING TEEN PREGNANCY EVEN REDUCING VIOLENT CRIME
IN STATES THAT
MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO EDUCATE OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN LIKE GEORGIA OR
OKLAHOMA STUDIES SHOW STUDENTS GROW UP MORE LIKELY TO READ AND DO MATH
AT GRADE LEVEL GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL HOLD A JOB FORM MORE STABLE
FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN
WE KNOW THIS WORKS
SO LET'S DO WHAT WORKS AND
MAKE SURE NONE OF OUR CHILDREN START THE RACE OF LIFE ALREADY BEHIND
LET'S GIVE OUR KIDS THAT CHANCE
LET'S ALSO MAKE SURE THAT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA PUTS OUR KIDS ON A PATH
TO A GOOD JOB
RIGHT NOW COUNTRIES LIKE GERMANY FOCUS ON GRADUATING
THEIR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH THE EQUIVALENT OF A TECHNICAL DEGREE
FROM ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES
SO THOSE GERMAN KIDS THEY'RE READY
FOR A JOB WHEN THEY GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL
THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED FOR THE
JOBS THAT ARE THERE
NOW AT SCHOOLS LIKE P TECH IN BROOKLYN A
COLLABORATION BETWEEN NEW YORK PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND CITY UNIVERSITY OF
NEW YORK AND IBM STUDENTS WILL GRADUATE WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND
AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE IN COMPUTERS OR ENGINEERING
WE NEED TO GIVE
EVERY AMERICAN STUDENT OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS
AND 4 YEARS AGO WE STARTED RACE TO THE TOP A COMPETITION THAT
CONVINCED ALMOST EVERY STATE TO DEVELOP SMARTER CURRICULA AND HIGHER
STANDARDS ALL FOR ABOUT 1 PERCENT OF WHAT WE SPEND ON EDUCATION EACH
YEAR
TONIGHT I'M ANNOUNCING A NEW CHALLENGE TO REDESIGN AMERICA'S HIGH
SCHOOLS SO THEY BETTER EQUIP GRADUATES FOR THE DEMANDS OF A HIGH TECH
ECONOMY
AND WE'LL REWARD SCHOOLS THAT DEVELOP NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH
COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS AND CREATE CLASSES THAT FOCUS ON SCIENCE
TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATH THE SKILLS TODAY'S EMPLOYERS ARE
LOOKING FOR TO FILL THE JOBS THAT ARE THERE RIGHT NOW AND WILL BE THERE
IN THE FUTURE
NOW EVEN WITH BETTER HIGH SCHOOLS MOST YOUNG PEOPLE WILL NEED SOME
HIGHER EDUCATION
IT'S A SIMPLE FACT THE MORE EDUCATION YOU'VE GOT
THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO HAVE A GOOD JOB AND WORK YOUR WAY INTO THE
MIDDLE CLASS
BUT TODAY SKYROCKETING COSTS PRICE TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE
OUT OF A HIGHER EDUCATION OR SADDLE THEM WITH UNSUSTAINABLE DEBT
THROUGH TAX CREDITS GRANTS AND BETTER LOANS WE'VE MADE COLLEGE MORE
AFFORDABLE FOR MILLIONS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES OVER THE LAST FEW
YEARS
BUT TAXPAYERS CAN'T KEEP ON SUBSIDIZING HIGHER AND HIGHER AND
HIGHER COSTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
COLLEGES MUST DO THEIR PART TO KEEP
COSTS DOWN AND IT'S OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO
SO TONIGHT I ASK CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT SO THAT
AFFORDABILITY AND VALUE ARE INCLUDED IN DETERMINING WHICH COLLEGES
RECEIVE CERTAIN TYPES OF FEDERAL AID
AND TOMORROW MY ADMINISTRATION
WILL RELEASE A NEW COLLEGE SCORECARD THAT PARENTS AND STUDENTS CAN USE
TO COMPARE SCHOOLS BASED ON A SIMPLE CRITERION WHERE YOU CAN GET THE
MOST BANG FOR YOUR EDUCATIONAL BUCK
NOW TO GROW OUR MIDDLE CLASS OUR CITIZENS HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE
EDUCATION AND TRAINING THAT TODAY'S JOBS REQUIRE
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO
MAKE SURE THAT AMERICA REMAINS A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE WHO'S WILLING TO
WORK EVERYBODY WHO'S WILLING TO WORK HARD HAS THE CHANCE TO GET AHEAD
OUR ECONOMY IS STRONGER WHEN WE HARNESS THE TALENTS AND INGENUITY OF
STRIVING HOPEFUL IMMIGRANTS
AND RIGHT NOW LEADERS FROM THE BUSINESS
LABOR LAW ENFORCEMENT FAITH COMMUNITIES THEY ALL AGREE THAT THE TIME
HAS COME TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
NOW IS THE TIME TO
DO IT
NOW IS THE TIME TO GET IT DONE
APPLAUSE NOW IS THE TIME TO
GET IT DONE
REAL REFORM MEANS STRONGER BORDER SECURITY AND WE CAN BUILD ON THE
PROGRESS MY ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY MADE PUTTING MORE BOOTS ON THE
SOUTHERN BORDER THAN AT ANY TIME IN OUR HISTORY AND REDUCING ILLEGAL
CROSSINGS TO THEIR LOWEST LEVELS IN 40 YEARS
REAL REFORM MEANS ESTABLISHING A RESPONSIBLE PATHWAY TO EARNED
CITIZENSHIP A PATH THAT INCLUDES PASSING A BACKGROUND CHECK PAYING
TAXES AND A MEANINGFUL PENALTY LEARNING ENGLISH AND GOING TO THE BACK
OF THE LINE BEHIND THE FOLKS TRYING TO COME HERE LEGALLY
AND REAL REFORM MEANS FIXING THE LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM TO CUT
WAITING PERIODS AND ATTRACT THE HIGHLY SKILLED ENTREPRENEURS AND
ENGINEERS THAT WILL HELP CREATE JOBS AND GROW OUR ECONOMY
IN OTHER WORDS WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
AND AS WE SPEAK
BIPARTISAN GROUPS IN BOTH CHAMBERS ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO DRAFT A
BILL AND I APPLAUD THEIR EFFORTS
SO LET'S GET THIS DONE
SEND ME A
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM BILL IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND I
WILL SIGN IT RIGHT AWAY
AND AMERICA WILL BE BETTER FOR IT
LET'S GET
IT DONE
APPLAUSE LET'S GET IT DONE
BUT WE CAN'T STOP THERE
WE KNOW OUR ECONOMY IS STRONGER WHEN OUR WIVES
OUR MOTHERS OUR DAUGHTERS CAN LIVE THEIR LIVES FREE FROM
DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE AND FREE FROM THE FEAR OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE
TODAY THE SENATE PASSED THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT
THAT JOE BIDEN ORIGINALLY WROTE ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO
AND I NOW URGE THE
HOUSE TO DO THE SAME
GOOD JOB JOE
AND I ASK THIS CONGRESS TO DECLARE
THAT WOMEN SHOULD EARN A LIVING EQUAL TO THEIR EFFORTS AND FINALLY
PASS THE PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT THIS YEAR
WE KNOW OUR ECONOMY IS STRONGER WHEN WE REWARD AN HONEST DAY'S WORK
WITH HONEST WAGES
BUT TODAY A FULL TIME WORKER MAKING THE MINIMUM
WAGE EARNS 14 500 A YEAR
EVEN WITH THE TAX RELIEF WE PUT IN PLACE A
FAMILY WITH TWO KIDS THAT EARNS THE MINIMUM WAGE STILL LIVES BELOW THE
POVERTY LINE
THAT'S WRONG
THAT'S WHY SINCE THE LAST TIME THIS
CONGRESS RAISED THE MINIMUM WAGE 19 STATES HAVE CHOSEN TO BUMP THEIRS
EVEN HIGHER
TONIGHT LET'S DECLARE THAT IN THE WEALTHIEST NATION ON EARTH NO ONE
WHO WORKS FULL TIME SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE IN POVERTY AND RAISE THE
FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE TO 9 AN HOUR
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT DONE
THIS SINGLE STEP WOULD RAISE THE INCOMES OF MILLIONS OF WORKING
FAMILIES
IT COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROCERIES OR THE FOOD
BANK RENT OR EVICTION SCRAPING BY OR FINALLY GETTING AHEAD
FOR
BUSINESSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT WOULD MEAN CUSTOMERS WITH MORE MONEY
IN THEIR POCKETS
AND A WHOLE LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE WOULD PROBABLY
NEED LESS HELP FROM GOVERNMENT
IN FACT WORKING FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO WAIT YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE TO GO UP WHILE CEO PAY HAS
NEVER BEEN HIGHER
SO HERE'S AN IDEA THAT GOVERNOR ROMNEY AND I
ACTUALLY AGREED ON LAST YEAR LET'S TIE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO THE COST OF
LIVING SO THAT IT FINALLY BECOMES A WAGE YOU CAN LIVE ON
TONIGHT LET'S ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES IN THIS COUNTRY
WHERE NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU WORK IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET
AHEAD FACTORY TOWNS DECIMATED FROM YEARS OF PLANTS PACKING UP
INESCAPABLE POCKETS OF POVERTY URBAN AND RURAL WHERE YOUNG ADULTS ARE
STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR FIRST JOB
AMERICA IS NOT A PLACE WHERE THE
CHANCE OF BIRTH OR CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD DECIDE OUR DESTINY
AND THAT'S
WHY WE NEED TO BUILD NEW LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS
FOR ALL WHO ARE WILLING TO CLIMB THEM
LET'S OFFER INCENTIVES TO COMPANIES THAT HIRE AMERICANS WHO'VE GOT WHAT
IT TAKES TO FILL THAT JOB OPENING BUT HAVE BEEN OUT OF WORK SO LONG
THAT NO ONE WILL GIVE THEM A CHANCE ANYMORE
LET'S PUT PEOPLE BACK TO
WORK REBUILDING VACANT HOMES IN RUNDOWN NEIGHBORHOODS
AND THIS YEAR
MY ADMINISTRATION WILL BEGIN TO PARTNER WITH 20 OF THE HARDEST HIT
TOWNS IN AMERICA TO GET THESE COMMUNITIES BACK ON THEIR FEET
NOW
WE'LL WORK WITH LOCAL LEADERS TO TARGET RESOURCES AT PUBLIC SAFETY AND
EDUCATION AND HOUSING
WE'LL GIVE NEW TAX CREDITS TO BUSINESSES THAT HIRE AND INVEST
AND
WE'LL WORK TO STRENGTHEN FAMILIES BY REMOVING THE FINANCIAL DETERRENTS
TO MARRIAGE FOR LOW INCOME COUPLES AND DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE FATHERHOOD
BECAUSE WHAT MAKES YOU A MAN ISN'T THE ABILITY TO CONCEIVE A CHILD
IT'S HAVING THE COURAGE TO RAISE ONE
AND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT
WE
WANT TO HELP THAT
STRONGER FAMILIES
STRONGER COMMUNITIES
A STRONGER AMERICA
IT IS THIS
KIND OF PROSPERITY BROAD SHARED BUILT ON A THRIVING MIDDLE CLASS THAT
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SOURCE OF OUR PROGRESS AT HOME
IT'S ALSO THE
FOUNDATION OF OUR POWER AND INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
TONIGHT WE STAND UNITED IN SALUTING THE TROOPS AND CIVILIANS WHO
SACRIFICE EVERY DAY TO PROTECT US
BECAUSE OF THEM WE CAN SAY WITH
CONFIDENCE THAT AMERICA WILL COMPLETE ITS MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN AND
ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVE OF DEFEATING THE CORE OF AL QAIDA
ALREADY WE HAVE BROUGHT HOME 33 000 OF OUR BRAVE SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN
THIS SPRING OUR FORCES WILL MOVE INTO A SUPPORT ROLE WHILE AFGHAN
SECURITY FORCES TAKE THE LEAD
TONIGHT I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT OVER THE
NEXT YEAR ANOTHER 34 000 AMERICAN TROOPS WILL COME HOME FROM
AFGHANISTAN
THIS DRAWDOWN WILL CONTINUE AND BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR
OUR WAR IN AFGHANISTAN WILL BE OVER
BEYOND 2014 AMERICA'S COMMITMENT TO A UNIFIED AND SOVEREIGN
AFGHANISTAN WILL ENDURE BUT THE NATURE OF OUR COMMITMENT WILL CHANGE
WE'RE NEGOTIATING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT THAT FOCUSES
ON TWO MISSIONS TRAINING AND EQUIPPING AFGHAN FORCES SO THAT THE
COUNTRY DOES NOT AGAIN SLIP INTO CHAOS AND COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS
THAT ALLOW US TO PURSUE THE REMNANTS OF AL QAIDA AND THEIR AFFILIATES
TODAY THE ORGANIZATION THAT ATTACKED US ON 9 11 IS A SHADOW OF ITS
FORMER SELF
IT'S TRUE DIFFERENT AL QAIDA AFFILIATES AND EXTREMIST
GROUPS HAVE EMERGED FROM THE ARABIAN PENINSULA TO AFRICA
THE THREAT
THESE GROUPS POSE IS EVOLVING
BUT TO MEET THIS THREAT WE DON'T NEED
TO SEND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS ABROAD OR OCCUPY
OTHER NATIONS
INSTEAD WE'LL NEED TO HELP COUNTRIES LIKE YEMEN AND
LIBYA AND SOMALIA PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN SECURITY AND HELP ALLIES WHO
TAKE THE FIGHT TO TERRORISTS AS WE HAVE IN MALI
AND WHERE NECESSARY
THROUGH A RANGE OF CAPABILITIES WE WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE DIRECT ACTION
AGAINST THOSE TERRORISTS WHO POSE THE GRAVEST THREAT TO AMERICANS
NOW AS WE DO WE MUST ENLIST OUR VALUES IN THE FIGHT
THAT'S WHY MY
ADMINISTRATION HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO FORGE A DURABLE LEGAL AND
POLICY FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE OUR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS
THROUGHOUT WE
HAVE KEPT CONGRESS FULLY INFORMED OF OUR EFFORTS
I RECOGNIZE THAT IN
OUR DEMOCRACY NO ONE SHOULD JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT WE'RE DOING
THINGS THE RIGHT WAY
SO IN THE MONTHS AHEAD I WILL CONTINUE TO
ENGAGE CONGRESS TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THAT OUR TARGETING DETENTION AND
PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LAWS AND SYSTEM
OF CHECKS AND BALANCES BUT THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE EVEN MORE TRANSPARENT
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND TO THE WORLD
OF COURSE OUR CHALLENGES DON'T END WITH AL QAIDA
AMERICA WILL
CONTINUE TO LEAD THE EFFORT TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE WORLD'S MOST
DANGEROUS WEAPONS
THE REGIME IN NORTH KOREA MUST KNOW THEY WILL ONLY
ACHIEVE SECURITY AND PROSPERITY BY MEETING THEIR INTERNATIONAL
OBLIGATIONS
PROVOCATIONS OF THE SORT WE SAW LAST NIGHT WILL ONLY
FURTHER ISOLATE THEM AS WE STAND BY OUR ALLIES STRENGTHEN OUR OWN
MISSILE DEFENSE AND LEAD THE WORLD IN TAKING FIRM ACTION IN RESPONSE
TO THESE THREATS
LIKEWISE THE LEADERS OF IRAN MUST RECOGNIZE THAT NOW IS THE TIME FOR A
DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION BECAUSE A COALITION STANDS UNITED IN DEMANDING
THAT THEY MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND WE WILL DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO
PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON
AT THE SAME TIME WE'LL ENGAGE RUSSIA TO SEEK FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN OUR
NUCLEAR ARSENALS AND CONTINUE LEADING THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO SECURE
NUCLEAR MATERIALS THAT COULD FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS BECAUSE OUR
ABILITY TO INFLUENCE OTHERS DEPENDS ON OUR WILLINGNESS TO LEAD AND MEET
OUR OBLIGATIONS
AMERICA MUST ALSO FACE THE RAPIDLY GROWING THREAT FROM CYBER ATTACKS
NOW WE KNOW HACKERS STEAL PEOPLE'S IDENTITIES AND INFILTRATE PRIVATE
E MAILS
WE KNOW FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANIES SWIPE OUR CORPORATE
SECRETS
NOW OUR ENEMIES ARE ALSO SEEKING THE ABILITY TO SABOTAGE OUR
POWER GRID OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OUR AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS
WE CANNOT LOOK BACK YEARS FROM NOW AND WONDER WHY WE DID NOTHING IN THE
FACE OF REAL THREATS TO OUR SECURITY AND OUR ECONOMY
AND THAT'S WHY EARLIER TODAY I SIGNED A NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WILL
STRENGTHEN OUR CYBER DEFENSES BY INCREASING INFORMATION SHARING AND
DEVELOPING STANDARDS TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY OUR JOBS AND
OUR PRIVACY
BUT NOW CONGRESS MUST ACT AS WELL BY PASSING LEGISLATION TO GIVE OUR
GOVERNMENT A GREATER CAPACITY TO SECURE OUR NETWORKS AND DETER ATTACKS
THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET DONE ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS
NOW EVEN AS WE PROTECT OUR PEOPLE WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT TODAY'S
WORLD PRESENTS NOT JUST DANGERS NOT JUST THREATS IT PRESENTS
OPPORTUNITIES
TO BOOST AMERICAN EXPORTS SUPPORT AMERICAN JOBS AND
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IN THE GROWING MARKETS OF ASIA WE INTEND TO
COMPLETE NEGOTIATIONS ON A TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP
AND TONIGHT I'M
ANNOUNCING THAT WE WILL LAUNCH TALKS ON A COMPREHENSIVE TRANSATLANTIC
TRADE AND INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION BECAUSE TRADE
THAT IS FAIR AND FREE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SUPPORTS MILLIONS OF GOOD
PAYING AMERICAN JOBS
WE ALSO KNOW THAT PROGRESS IN THE MOST IMPOVERISHED PARTS OF OUR WORLD
ENRICHES US ALL NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT CREATES NEW MARKETS MORE STABLE
ORDER IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE WORLD BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO
IN MANY PLACES PEOPLE LIVE ON LITTLE MORE THAN A DOLLAR A
DAY
SO THE UNITED STATES WILL JOIN WITH OUR ALLIES TO ERADICATE SUCH
EXTREME POVERTY IN THE NEXT TWO DECADES BY CONNECTING MORE PEOPLE TO
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY EMPOWERING WOMEN BY GIVING OUR YOUNG AND
BRIGHTEST MINDS NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE AND HELPING COMMUNITIES TO
FEED AND POWER AND EDUCATE THEMSELVES BY SAVING THE WORLD'S CHILDREN
FROM PREVENTABLE DEATHS AND BY REALIZING THE PROMISE OF AN AIDS FREE
GENERATION WHICH IS WITHIN OUR REACH
YOU SEE AMERICA MUST REMAIN A BEACON TO ALL WHO SEEK FREEDOM DURING
THIS PERIOD OF HISTORIC CHANGE
I SAW THE POWER OF HOPE LAST YEAR IN
RANGOON IN BURMA WHEN AUNG SAN SUU KYI WELCOMED AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT
INTO THE HOME WHERE SHE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED FOR YEARS WHEN THOUSANDS
OF BURMESE LINED THE STREETS WAVING AMERICAN FLAGS INCLUDING A MAN
WHO SAID THERE IS JUSTICE AND LAW IN THE UNITED STATES
I WANT OUR
COUNTRY TO BE LIKE THAT
IN DEFENSE OF FREEDOM WE'LL REMAIN THE ANCHOR OF STRONG ALLIANCES FROM
THE AMERICAS TO AFRICA FROM EUROPE TO ASIA
IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE
WILL STAND WITH CITIZENS AS THEY DEMAND THEIR UNIVERSAL RIGHTS AND
SUPPORT STABLE TRANSITIONS TO DEMOCRACY
WE KNOW THE PROCESS WILL BE MESSY AND WE CANNOT PRESUME TO DICTATE THE
COURSE OF CHANGE IN COUNTRIES LIKE EGYPT BUT WE CAN AND WILL INSIST ON
RESPECT FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE
WE'LL KEEP THE
PRESSURE ON A SYRIAN REGIME THAT HAS MURDERED ITS OWN PEOPLE AND
SUPPORT OPPOSITION LEADERS THAT RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF EVERY SYRIAN
AND
WE WILL STAND STEADFAST WITH ISRAEL IN PURSUIT OF SECURITY AND A
LASTING PEACE
THESE ARE THE MESSAGES I'LL DELIVER WHEN I TRAVEL TO THE MIDDLE EAST
NEXT MONTH
AND ALL THIS WORK DEPENDS ON THE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE OF
THOSE WHO SERVE IN DANGEROUS PLACES AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK OUR
DIPLOMATS OUR INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS AND THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE
UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES
AS LONG AS I'M COMMANDER IN CHIEF WE WILL
DO WHATEVER WE MUST TO PROTECT THOSE WHO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY ABROAD
AND WE WILL MAINTAIN THE BEST MILITARY THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN
WE'LL INVEST IN NEW CAPABILITIES EVEN AS WE REDUCE WASTE AND WARTIME
SPENDING
WE WILL ENSURE EQUAL TREATMENT FOR ALL SERVICEMEMBERS AND
EQUAL BENEFITS FOR THEIR FAMILIES GAY AND STRAIGHT
WE WILL DRAW UPON
THE COURAGE AND SKILLS OF OUR SISTERS AND DAUGHTERS AND MOMS BECAUSE
WOMEN HAVE PROVEN UNDER FIRE THAT THEY ARE READY FOR COMBAT
WE WILL KEEP FAITH WITH OUR VETERANS INVESTING IN WORLD CLASS CARE
INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS SUPPORTING OUR
MILITARY FAMILIES GIVING OUR VETERANS THE BENEFITS AND EDUCATION AND
JOB OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE EARNED
AND I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE
MICHELLE AND DR
JILL BIDEN FOR THEIR CONTINUED DEDICATION TO SERVING
OUR MILITARY FAMILIES AS WELL AS THEY HAVE SERVED US
THANK YOU HONEY
THANK YOU JILL
DEFENDING OUR FREEDOM THOUGH IS NOT JUST THE JOB OF OUR MILITARY
ALONE
WE MUST ALL DO OUR PART TO MAKE SURE OUR GOD GIVEN RIGHTS ARE
PROTECTED HERE AT HOME
THAT INCLUDES ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL
RIGHTS OF A DEMOCRACY THE RIGHT TO VOTE
NOW WHEN ANY AMERICAN NO
MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE OR WHAT THEIR PARTY ARE DENIED THAT RIGHT
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT FOR 5 OR 6 OR 7 HOURS JUST TO CAST
THEIR BALLOT WE ARE BETRAYING OUR IDEALS
SO TONIGHT I'M ANNOUNCING A NONPARTISAN COMMISSION TO IMPROVE THE
VOTING EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA
AND IT DEFINITELY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
I'M
ASKING TWO LONG TIME EXPERTS IN THE FIELD WHO BY THE WAY RECENTLY
SERVED AS THE TOP ATTORNEYS FOR MY CAMPAIGN AND FOR GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S
CAMPAIGN TO LEAD IT
WE CAN FIX THIS AND WE WILL
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
DEMAND IT AND SO DOES OUR DEMOCRACY
OF COURSE WHAT I'VE SAID TONIGHT MATTERS LITTLE IF WE DON'T COME
TOGETHER TO PROTECT OUR MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE OUR CHILDREN
IT HAS
BEEN 2 MONTHS SINCE NEWTOWN
I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS
COUNTRY HAS DEBATED HOW TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE
BUT THIS TIME IS
DIFFERENT
OVERWHELMING MAJORITIES OF AMERICANS AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE
IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT HAVE COME TOGETHER AROUND COMMONSENSE REFORM
LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR CRIMINALS TO GET
THEIR HANDS ON A GUN
SENATORS OF BOTH PARTIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON
TOUGH NEW LAWS TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM BUYING GUNS FOR RESALE TO
CRIMINALS
POLICE CHIEFS ARE ASKING OUR HELP TO GET WEAPONS OF WAR AND
MASSIVE AMMUNITION MAGAZINES OFF OUR STREETS BECAUSE THESE POLICE
CHIEFS THEY'RE TIRED OF SEEING THEIR GUYS AND GALS BEING OUTGUNNED
EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS DESERVES A VOTE IN CONGRESS
NOW IF YOU WANT
TO VOTE NO THAT'S YOUR CHOICE
BUT THESE PROPOSALS DESERVE A VOTE
BECAUSE IN THE 2 MONTHS SINCE NEWTOWN MORE THAN A THOUSAND BIRTHDAYS
GRADUATIONS ANNIVERSARIES HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM OUR LIVES BY A BULLET
FROM A GUN MORE THAN A THOUSAND
ONE OF THOSE WE LOST WAS A YOUNG GIRL NAMED HADIYA PENDLETON
SHE WAS
15 YEARS OLD
SHE LOVED FIG NEWTONS AND LIP GLOSS
SHE WAS A MAJORETTE
SHE WAS SO GOOD TO HER FRIENDS THEY ALL THOUGHT THEY WERE HER BEST
FRIEND
JUST 3 WEEKS AGO SHE WAS HERE IN WASHINGTON WITH HER
CLASSMATES PERFORMING FOR HER COUNTRY AT MY INAUGURATION
AND A WEEK
LATER SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN A CHICAGO PARK AFTER SCHOOL JUST A
MILE AWAY FROM MY HOUSE
HADIYA'S PARENTS NATE AND CLEO ARE IN THIS CHAMBER TONIGHT ALONG
WITH MORE THAN TWO DOZEN AMERICANS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN TORN APART BY
GUN VIOLENCE
THEY DESERVE A VOTE
THEY DESERVE A VOTE
APPLAUSE THEY
DESERVE A VOTE
GABBY GIFFORDS DESERVES A VOTE
THE FAMILIES OF NEWTOWN
DESERVE A VOTE
THE FAMILIES OF AURORA DESERVE A VOTE
THE FAMILIES OF
OAK CREEK AND TUCSON AND BLACKSBURG AND THE COUNTLESS OTHER
COMMUNITIES RIPPED OPEN BY GUN VIOLENCE THEY DESERVE A SIMPLE VOTE
THEY DESERVE A SIMPLE VOTE
OUR ACTIONS WILL NOT PREVENT EVERY SENSELESS ACT OF VIOLENCE IN THIS
COUNTRY
IN FACT NO LAWS NO INITIATIVES NO ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS WILL
PERFECTLY SOLVE ALL THE CHALLENGES I'VE OUTLINED TONIGHT
BUT WE WERE
NEVER SENT HERE TO BE PERFECT
WE WERE SENT HERE TO MAKE WHAT
DIFFERENCE WE CAN TO SECURE THIS NATION EXPAND OPPORTUNITY UPHOLD
OUR IDEALS THROUGH THE HARD OFTEN FRUSTRATING BUT ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY WORK OF SELF GOVERNMENT
WE WERE SENT HERE TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR FELLOW AMERICANS THE SAME WAY
THEY LOOK OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER EVERY SINGLE DAY USUALLY WITHOUT
FANFARE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR EXAMPLE
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF A NEW YORK CITY NURSE NAMED MENCHU
SANCHEZ
WHEN HURRICANE SANDY PLUNGED HER HOSPITAL INTO DARKNESS SHE
WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HOW HER OWN HOME WAS FARING
HER MIND WAS ON THE
20 PRECIOUS NEWBORNS IN HER CARE AND THE RESCUE PLAN SHE DEVISED THAT
KEPT THEM ALL SAFE
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF A NORTH MIAMI WOMAN NAMED DESILINE
VICTOR
WHEN DESILINE ARRIVED AT HER POLLING PLACE SHE WAS TOLD THE
WAIT TO VOTE MIGHT BE 6 HOURS
AND AS TIME TICKED BY HER CONCERN WAS
NOT WITH HER TIRED BODY OR ACHING FEET BUT WHETHER FOLKS LIKE HER
WOULD GET TO HAVE THEIR SAY
AND HOUR AFTER HOUR A THRONG OF PEOPLE
STAYED IN LINE TO SUPPORT HER BECAUSE DESILINE IS 102 YEARS OLD
AND
THEY ERUPTED IN CHEERS WHEN SHE FINALLY PUT ON A STICKER THAT READ I
VOTED APPLAUSE THERE'S DESILINE
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF A POLICE OFFICER NAMED BRIAN MURPHY
WHEN A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE ON A SIKH TEMPLE IN WISCONSIN AND BRIAN WAS
THE FIRST TO ARRIVE AND HE DID NOT CONSIDER HIS OWN SAFETY
HE FOUGHT
BACK UNTIL HELP ARRIVED AND ORDERED HIS FELLOW OFFICERS TO PROTECT THE
SAFETY OF THE AMERICANS WORSHIPING INSIDE EVEN AS HE LAY BLEEDING FROM
12 BULLET WOUNDS
AND WHEN ASKED HOW HE DID THAT BRIAN SAID THAT'S
JUST THE WAY WE'RE MADE
THAT'S JUST THE WAY WE'RE MADE
WE MAY DO DIFFERENT JOBS AND WEAR
DIFFERENT UNIFORMS AND HOLD DIFFERENT VIEWS THAN THE PERSON BESIDE US
BUT AS AMERICANS WE ALL SHARE THE SAME PROUD TITLE WE ARE CITIZENS
IT'S A WORD THAT DOESN'T JUST DESCRIBE OUR NATIONALITY OR LEGAL STATUS
IT DESCRIBES THE WAY WE'RE MADE
IT DESCRIBES WHAT WE BELIEVE
IT
CAPTURES THE ENDURING IDEA THAT THIS COUNTRY ONLY WORKS WHEN WE ACCEPT
CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT OUR
RIGHTS ARE WRAPPED UP IN THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND THAT WELL INTO OUR
THIRD CENTURY AS A NATION IT REMAINS THE TASK OF US ALL AS CITIZENS
OF THESE UNITED STATES TO BE THE AUTHORS OF THE NEXT GREAT CHAPTER OF
OUR AMERICAN STORY
THANK YOU
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
BARACK OBAMA
JANUARY 28 2014
THE PRESIDENT
MR
SPEAKER MR
VICE PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MY
FELLOW AMERICANS TODAY IN AMERICA A TEACHER SPENT EXTRA TIME WITH A
STUDENT WHO NEEDED IT AND DID HER PART TO LIFT AMERICA'S GRADUATION
RATE TO ITS HIGHEST LEVELS IN MORE THAN THREE DECADES
AN ENTREPRENEUR
FLIPPED ON THE LIGHTS IN HER TECH STARTUP AND DID HER PART TO ADD TO
THE MORE THAN 8 MILLION NEW JOBS OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED OVER THE
PAST 4 YEARS
AN AUTOWORKER FINE TUNED SOME OF THE BEST MOST FUEL
EFFICIENT CARS IN THE WORLD AND DID HIS PART TO HELP AMERICA WEAN
ITSELF OFF FOREIGN OIL
A FARMER PREPARED FOR THE SPRING AFTER THE STRONGEST 5 YEAR STRETCH OF
FARM EXPORTS IN OUR HISTORY
A RURAL DOCTOR GAVE A YOUNG CHILD THE
FIRST PRESCRIPTION TO TREAT ASTHMA THAT HIS MOTHER COULD AFFORD
A MAN
TOOK THE BUS HOME FROM THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT BONE TIRED BUT DREAMING
BIG DREAMS FOR HIS SON
AND IN TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS
AMERICA FATHERS AND MOTHERS WILL TUCK IN THEIR KIDS PUT AN ARM AROUND
THEIR SPOUSE REMEMBER FALLEN COMRADES AND GIVE THANKS FOR BEING HOME
FROM A WAR THAT AFTER 12 LONG YEARS IS FINALLY COMING TO AN END
TONIGHT THIS CHAMBER SPEAKS WITH ONE VOICE TO THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT
IT IS YOU OUR CITIZENS WHO MAKE THE STATE OF OUR UNION STRONG
AND HERE ARE THE RESULTS OF YOUR EFFORTS THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
IN OVER 5 YEARS A REBOUNDING HOUSING MARKET A MANUFACTURING SECTOR
THAT'S ADDING JOBS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE 1990S MORE OIL
PRODUCED AT HOME THAN WE BUY FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD THE FIRST TIME
THAT'S HAPPENED IN NEARLY 20 YEARS OUR DEFICITS CUT BY MORE THAN HALF
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE BUSINESS LEADERS AROUND THE
WORLD HAVE DECLARED THAT CHINA IS NO LONGER THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE
PLACE TO INVEST AMERICA IS
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THIS CAN BE A BREAKTHROUGH YEAR FOR AMERICA
AFTER
5 YEARS OF GRIT AND DETERMINED EFFORT THE UNITED STATES IS BETTER
POSITIONED FOR THE 21ST CENTURY THAN ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH
THE QUESTION FOR EVERYONE IN THIS CHAMBER RUNNING THROUGH EVERY
DECISION WE MAKE THIS YEAR IS WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO HELP OR HINDER
THIS PROGRESS
FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW THIS TOWN HAS BEEN CONSUMED BY A
RANCOROUS ARGUMENT OVER THE PROPER SIZE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
IT'S
AN IMPORTANT DEBATE ONE THAT DATES BACK TO OUR VERY FOUNDING
BUT WHEN
THAT DEBATE PREVENTS US FROM CARRYING OUT EVEN THE MOST BASIC FUNCTIONS
OF OUR DEMOCRACY WHEN OUR DIFFERENCES SHUT DOWN GOVERNMENT OR THREATEN
THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE UNITED STATES THEN WE ARE NOT DOING
RIGHT BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
NOW AS PRESIDENT I'M COMMITTED TO MAKING WASHINGTON WORK BETTER AND
REBUILDING THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE WHO SENT US HERE
AND I BELIEVE MOST
OF YOU ARE TOO
LAST MONTH THANKS TO THE WORK OF DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS CONGRESS FINALLY PRODUCED A BUDGET THAT UNDOES SOME OF
LAST YEAR'S SEVERE CUTS TO PRIORITIES LIKE EDUCATION
NOBODY GOT
EVERYTHING THEY WANTED AND WE CAN STILL DO MORE TO INVEST IN THIS
COUNTRY'S FUTURE WHILE BRINGING DOWN OUR DEFICIT IN A BALANCED WAY BUT
THE BUDGET COMPROMISE SHOULD LEAVE US FREER TO FOCUS ON CREATING NEW
JOBS NOT CREATING NEW CRISES
AND IN THE COMING MONTHS LET'S SEE WHERE ELSE WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS
TOGETHER
LET'S MAKE THIS A YEAR OF ACTION
THAT'S WHAT MOST AMERICANS
WANT FOR ALL OF US IN THIS CHAMBER TO FOCUS ON THEIR LIVES THEIR
HOPES THEIR ASPIRATIONS
AND WHAT I BELIEVE UNITES THE PEOPLE OF THIS
NATION REGARDLESS OF RACE OR REGION OR PARTY YOUNG OR OLD RICH OR
POOR IS THE SIMPLE PROFOUND BELIEF IN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THE NOTION
THAT IF YOU WORK HARD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY YOU CAN GET AHEAD IN
AMERICA
NOW LET'S FACE IT THAT BELIEF HAS SUFFERED SOME SERIOUS BLOWS
OVER
MORE THAN THREE DECADES EVEN BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION HIT MASSIVE
SHIFTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBAL COMPETITION HAD ELIMINATED A LOT OF
GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND WEAKENED THE ECONOMIC FOUNDATIONS THAT
FAMILIES DEPEND ON
TODAY AFTER 4 YEARS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH CORPORATE PROFITS AND STOCK
PRICES HAVE RARELY BEEN HIGHER AND THOSE AT THE TOP HAVE NEVER DONE
BETTER
BUT AVERAGE WAGES HAVE BARELY BUDGED
INEQUALITY HAS DEEPENED
UPWARD MOBILITY HAS STALLED
THE COLD HARD FACT IS THAT EVEN IN THE
MIDST OF RECOVERY TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE WORKING MORE THAN EVER JUST
TO GET BY LET ALONE TO GET AHEAD
AND TOO MANY STILL AREN'T WORKING AT
ALL
SO OUR JOB IS TO REVERSE THESE TRENDS
IT WON'T HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY AND
WE WON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING
BUT WHAT I OFFER TONIGHT IS A SET OF
CONCRETE PRACTICAL PROPOSALS TO SPEED UP GROWTH STRENGTHEN THE MIDDLE
CLASS AND BUILD NEW LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITY INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS
SOME
REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION AND I AM EAGER TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU
BUT AMERICA DOES NOT STAND STILL AND NEITHER WILL I
SO WHEREVER AND
WHENEVER I CAN TAKE STEPS WITHOUT LEGISLATION TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY FOR
MORE AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO
AS USUAL OUR FIRST LADY SETS A GOOD EXAMPLE
APPLAUSE WELL
APPLAUSE
MICHELLE'S LET'S MOVE PARTNERSHIP WITH SCHOOLS
BUSINESSES LOCAL LEADERS HAS HELPED BRING DOWN CHILDHOOD OBESITY RATES
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 YEARS
AND THAT'S AN ACHIEVEMENT THAT WILL
IMPROVE LIVES AND REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR DECADES TO COME
THE
JOINING FORCES ALLIANCE THAT MICHELLE AND JILL BIDEN LAUNCHED HAS
ALREADY ENCOURAGED EMPLOYERS TO HIRE OR TRAIN NEARLY 400 000 VETERANS
AND MILITARY SPOUSES
TAKING A PAGE FROM THAT PLAYBOOK THE WHITE HOUSE JUST ORGANIZED A
COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY SUMMIT WHERE ALREADY 150 UNIVERSITIES BUSINESSES
NONPROFITS HAVE MADE CONCRETE COMMITMENTS TO REDUCE INEQUALITY IN
ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND TO HELP EVERY HARD WORKING KID GO TO
COLLEGE AND SUCCEED WHEN THEY GET TO CAMPUS
AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY
WE'RE PARTNERING WITH MAYORS GOVERNORS AND STATE LEGISLATURES ON
ISSUES FROM HOMELESSNESS TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY
THE POINT IS THERE ARE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON WHO
ARE TIRED OF STALE POLITICAL ARGUMENTS AND ARE MOVING THIS COUNTRY
FORWARD
THEY BELIEVE AND I BELIEVE THAT HERE IN AMERICA OUR SUCCESS
SHOULD DEPEND NOT ON ACCIDENT OF BIRTH BUT THE STRENGTH OF OUR WORK
ETHIC AND THE SCOPE OF OUR DREAMS
THAT'S WHAT DREW OUR FOREBEARS HERE
THAT'S HOW THE DAUGHTER OF A FACTORY WORKER IS CEO OF AMERICA'S LARGEST
AUTOMAKER HOW THE SON OF A BARKEEP IS SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE HOW THE
SON OF A SINGLE MOM CAN BE PRESIDENT OF THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH
OPPORTUNITY IS WHO WE ARE
AND THE DEFINING PROJECT OF OUR GENERATION
MUST BE TO RESTORE THAT PROMISE
WE KNOW WHERE TO START THE BEST
MEASURE OF OPPORTUNITY IS ACCESS TO A GOOD JOB
WITH THE ECONOMY
PICKING UP SPEED COMPANIES SAY THEY INTEND TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE THIS
YEAR
AND OVER HALF OF BIG MANUFACTURERS SAY THEY'RE THINKING OF
INSOURCING JOBS FROM ABROAD
SO LET'S MAKE THAT DECISION EASIER FOR MORE COMPANIES
BOTH DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS HAVE ARGUED THAT OUR TAX CODE IS RIDDLED WITH WASTEFUL
COMPLICATED LOOPHOLES THAT PUNISH BUSINESSES INVESTING HERE AND REWARD
COMPANIES THAT KEEP PROFITS ABROAD
LET'S FLIP THAT EQUATION
LET'S
WORK TOGETHER TO CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES END THOSE INCENTIVES TO SHIP
JOBS OVERSEAS AND LOWER TAX RATES FOR BUSINESSES THAT CREATE JOBS
RIGHT HERE AT HOME
MOREOVER WE CAN TAKE THE MONEY WE SAVE FROM THIS TRANSITION TO TAX
REFORM TO CREATE JOBS REBUILDING OUR ROADS UPGRADING OUR PORTS
UNCLOGGING OUR COMMUTES BECAUSE IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY FIRST CLASS
JOBS GRAVITATE TO FIRST CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE
WE'LL NEED CONGRESS TO
PROTECT MORE THAN 3 MILLION JOBS BY FINISHING TRANSPORTATION AND
WATERWAYS BILLS THIS SUMMER
THAT CAN HAPPEN
BUT I'LL ACT ON MY OWN TO
SLASH BUREAUCRACY AND STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR KEY
PROJECTS SO WE CAN GET MORE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON THE JOB AS FAST AS
POSSIBLE
WE ALSO HAVE THE CHANCE RIGHT NOW TO BEAT OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE RACE
FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF HIGH TECH MANUFACTURING JOBS
MY ADMINISTRATION
HAS LAUNCHED TWO HUBS FOR HIGH TECH MANUFACTURING IN RALEIGH NORTH
CAROLINA AND YOUNGSTOWN OHIO WHERE WE'VE CONNECTED BUSINESSES TO
RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES THAT CAN HELP AMERICA LEAD THE WORLD IN ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGIES
TONIGHT I'M ANNOUNCING WE'LL LAUNCH SIX MORE THIS YEAR
BIPARTISAN BILLS IN BOTH HOUSES COULD DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF THESE HUBS
AND THE JOBS THEY CREATE
SO GET THOSE BILLS TO MY DESK
PUT MORE
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK
LET'S DO MORE TO HELP THE ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO
CREATE MOST NEW JOBS IN AMERICA
OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS MY
ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE MORE LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAN ANY
OTHER
AND WHEN 98 PERCENT OF OUR EXPORTERS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES NEW
TRADE PARTNERSHIPS WITH EUROPE AND ASIA THE ASIA PACIFIC WILL HELP THEM
CREATE MORE JOBS
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON TOOLS LIKE BIPARTISAN
TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS PROTECT OUR
ENVIRONMENT AND OPEN NEW MARKETS TO NEW GOODS STAMPED MADE IN THE
U S A
LISTEN CHINA AND EUROPE AREN'T STANDING ON THE SIDELINES AND NEITHER
SHOULD WE
WE KNOW THAT THE NATION THAT GOES ALL IN ON INNOVATION TODAY
WILL OWN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY TOMORROW
THIS IS AN EDGE AMERICA CANNOT
SURRENDER
FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH HELPED LEAD TO THE IDEAS AND
INVENTIONS BEHIND GOOGLE AND SMARTPHONES
AND THAT'S WHY CONGRESS
SHOULD UNDO THE DAMAGE DONE BY LAST YEAR'S CUTS TO BASIC RESEARCH SO WE
CAN UNLEASH THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN DISCOVERY
THERE ARE ENTIRE
INDUSTRIES TO BE BUILT BASED ON VACCINES THAT STAY AHEAD OF DRUG
RESISTANT BACTERIA OR PAPER THIN MATERIAL THAT'S STRONGER THAN STEEL
AND LET'S PASS A PATENT REFORM BILL THAT ALLOWS OUR BUSINESSES TO STAY
FOCUSED ON INNOVATION NOT COSTLY AND NEEDLESS LITIGATION
NOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTORS IN BRINGING MORE JOBS BACK IS OUR
COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN ENERGY
THE ALL OF THE ABOVE ENERGY STRATEGY I
ANNOUNCED A FEW YEARS AGO IS WORKING AND TODAY AMERICA IS CLOSER TO
ENERGY INDEPENDENCE THAN WE HAVE BEEN IN DECADES
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IS NATURAL GAS
IF EXTRACTED SAFELY IT'S THE
BRIDGE FUEL THAT CAN POWER OUR ECONOMY WITH LESS OF THE CARBON
POLLUTION THAT CAUSES CLIMATE CHANGE
BUSINESSES PLAN TO INVEST ALMOST
100 BILLION IN NEW FACTORIES THAT USE NATURAL GAS
I'LL CUT REDTAPE TO
HELP STATES GET THOSE FACTORIES BUILT AND PUT FOLKS TO WORK AND THIS
CONGRESS CAN HELP BY PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK BUILDING FUELING STATIONS
THAT SHIFT MORE CARS AND TRUCKS FROM FOREIGN OIL TO AMERICAN NATURAL
GAS
MEANWHILE MY ADMINISTRATION WILL KEEP WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO
SUSTAIN PRODUCTION AND JOBS GROWTH WHILE STRENGTHENING PROTECTION OF
OUR AIR OUR WATER OUR COMMUNITIES
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT I'LL USE MY
AUTHORITY TO PROTECT MORE OF OUR PRISTINE FEDERAL LANDS FOR FUTURE
GENERATIONS
WELL IT'S NOT JUST OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION THAT'S BOOMING
WE'RE BECOMING A GLOBAL LEADER IN SOLAR TOO
EVERY 4 MINUTES ANOTHER
AMERICAN HOME OR BUSINESS GOES SOLAR EVERY PANEL POUNDED INTO PLACE BY
A WORKER WHOSE JOB CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED
LET'S CONTINUE THAT PROGRESS
WITH A SMARTER TAX POLICY THAT STOPS GIVING 4 BILLION A YEAR TO FOSSIL
FUEL INDUSTRIES THAT DON'T NEED IT SO WE CAN INVEST MORE IN FUELS OF
THE FUTURE THAT DO
AND EVEN AS WE'VE INCREASED ENERGY PRODUCTION WE'VE PARTNERED WITH
BUSINESSES BUILDERS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE THE ENERGY WE
CONSUME
WHEN WE RESCUED OUR AUTOMAKERS FOR EXAMPLE WE WORKED WITH
THEM TO SET HIGHER FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR OUR CARS
IN THE
COMING MONTHS I'LL BUILD ON THAT SUCCESS BY SETTING NEW STANDARDS FOR
OUR TRUCKS SO WE CAN KEEP DRIVING DOWN OIL IMPORTS AND WHAT WE PAY AT
THE PUMP
AND TAKEN TOGETHER OUR ENERGY POLICY IS CREATING JOBS AND LEADING TO A
CLEANER SAFER PLANET
OVER THE PAST 8 YEARS THE UNITED STATES HAS
REDUCED OUR TOTAL CARBON POLLUTION MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH
BUT WE HAVE TO ACT WITH MORE URGENCY BECAUSE A CHANGING CLIMATE IS
ALREADY HARMING WESTERN COMMUNITIES STRUGGLING WITH DROUGHT AND COASTAL
CITIES DEALING WITH FLOODS
THAT'S WHY I DIRECTED MY ADMINISTRATION TO
WORK WITH STATES UTILITIES AND OTHERS TO SET NEW STANDARDS ON THE
AMOUNT OF CARBON POLLUTION OUR POWER PLANTS ARE ALLOWED TO DUMP INTO
THE AIR
THE SHIFT TO A CLEANER ENERGY ECONOMY WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND IT
WILL REQUIRE SOME TOUGH CHOICES ALONG THE WAY
BUT THE DEBATE IS
SETTLED
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A FACT
AND WHEN OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN
LOOK US IN THE EYE AND ASK IF WE DID ALL WE COULD TO LEAVE THEM A SAFER
MORE STABLE WORLD WITH NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY I WANT US TO BE ABLE TO
SAY YES WE DID
FINALLY IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH IT IS TIME TO HEED THE
CALL OF BUSINESS LEADERS LABOR LEADERS FAITH LEADERS LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND FIX OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS IN THE
SENATE HAVE ACTED AND I KNOW THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES IN THE HOUSE
WANT TO DO THE SAME
INDEPENDENT ECONOMISTS SAY IMMIGRATION REFORM WILL
GROW OUR ECONOMY AND SHRINK OUR DEFICITS BY ALMOST 1 TRILLION IN THE
NEXT TWO DECADES
AND FOR GOOD REASON WHEN PEOPLE COME HERE TO FULFILL
THEIR DREAMS TO STUDY INVENT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CULTURE THEY MAKE OUR
COUNTRY A MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR BUSINESSES TO LOCATE AND CREATE
JOBS FOR EVERYBODY
SO LET'S GET IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE THIS YEAR
APPLAUSE LET'S GET IT DONE
IT'S TIME
THE IDEAS I'VE OUTLINED SO FAR CAN SPEED UP GROWTH AND CREATE MORE JOBS
BUT IN THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING ECONOMY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY
AMERICAN HAS THE SKILLS TO FILL THOSE JOBS
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE KNOW
HOW TO DO IT
TWO YEARS AGO AS THE AUTO INDUSTRY CAME ROARING BACK ANDRA RUSH
OPENED UP A MANUFACTURING FIRM IN DETROIT
SHE KNEW THAT FORD NEEDED
PARTS FOR THE BEST SELLING TRUCK IN AMERICA AND SHE KNEW HOW TO MAKE
THOSE PARTS
SHE JUST NEEDED THE WORKFORCE
SO SHE DIALED UP WHAT WE
CALL AN AMERICAN JOB CENTER PLACES WHERE FOLKS CAN WALK IN TO GET THE
HELP OR TRAINING THEY NEED TO FIND A NEW JOB OR A BETTER JOB
SHE WAS
FLOODED WITH NEW WORKERS
AND TODAY DETROIT MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS HAS
MORE THAN 700 EMPLOYEES
AND WHAT ANDRA AND HER EMPLOYEES EXPERIENCED
IS HOW IT SHOULD BE FOR EVERY EMPLOYER AND EVERY JOB SEEKER
SO TONIGHT I'VE ASKED VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN TO LEAD AN ACROSS THE BOARD
REFORM OF AMERICA'S TRAINING PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ONE
MISSION TRAIN AMERICANS WITH THE SKILLS EMPLOYERS NEED AND MATCH THEM
TO GOOD JOBS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED RIGHT NOW
THAT MEANS MORE ON THE
JOB TRAINING AND MORE APPRENTICESHIPS THAT SET A YOUNG WORKER ON AN
UPWARD TRAJECTORY FOR LIFE
IT MEANS CONNECTING COMPANIES TO COMMUNITY
COLLEGES THAT CAN HELP DESIGN TRAINING TO FILL THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS
AND IF CONGRESS WANTS TO HELP YOU CAN CONCENTRATE FUNDING ON PROVEN
PROGRAMS THAT CONNECT MORE READY TO WORK AMERICANS WITH READY TO BE
FILLED JOBS
I'M ALSO CONVINCED WE CAN HELP AMERICANS RETURN TO THE WORKFORCE FASTER
BY REFORMING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SO THAT IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE IN
TODAY'S ECONOMY
BUT FIRST THIS CONGRESS NEEDS TO RESTORE THE
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE YOU JUST LET EXPIRE FOR 1 6 MILLION PEOPLE
LET ME TELL YOU WHY
MISTY DEMARS IS A MOTHER OF TWO YOUNG BOYS
SHE'D
BEEN STEADILY EMPLOYED SINCE SHE WAS A TEENAGER PUT HERSELF THROUGH
COLLEGE
SHE'D NEVER COLLECTED UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BUT SHE'D BEEN
PAYING TAXES
IN MAY SHE AND HER HUSBAND USED THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO
BUY THEIR FIRST HOME
A WEEK LATER BUDGET CUTS CLAIMED THE JOB SHE
LOVED
LAST MONTH WHEN THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WAS CUT OFF SHE
SAT DOWN AND WROTE ME A LETTER THE KIND I GET EVERY DAY
WE ARE THE
FACE OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS SHE WROTE
I'M NOT DEPENDENT ON THE
GOVERNMENT
OUR COUNTRY DEPENDS ON PEOPLE LIKE US WHO BUILD CAREERS
CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY CARE ABOUT OUR NEIGHBORS
I'M CONFIDENT THAT IN
TIME I WILL FIND A JOB I WILL PAY MY TAXES AND WE WILL RAISE OUR
CHILDREN IN THEIR OWN HOME IN THE COMMUNITY WE LOVE
PLEASE GIVE US
THIS CHANCE
CONGRESS GIVE THESE HARD WORKING RESPONSIBLE AMERICANS THAT CHANCE
GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE
APPLAUSE GIVE THEM THE CHANCE
THEY NEED OUR
HELP RIGHT NOW
BUT MORE IMPORTANT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS THEM IN THE GAME
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN ASKING CEOS TO GIVE MORE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED
WORKERS A FAIR SHOT AT NEW JOBS A NEW CHANCE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES
AND IN FACT THIS WEEK MANY WILL COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO MAKE THAT
COMMITMENT REAL
TONIGHT I ASK EVERY BUSINESS LEADER IN AMERICA TO JOIN
US AND TO DO THE SAME BECAUSE WE ARE STRONGER WHEN AMERICA FIELDS A
FULL TEAM
OF COURSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TRAIN TODAY'S WORKFORCE
WE ALSO HAVE TO
PREPARE TOMORROW'S WORKFORCE BY GUARANTEEING EVERY CHILD ACCESS TO A
WORLD CLASS EDUCATION
ESTIVEN RODRIGUEZ COULDN'T SPEAK A WORD OF
ENGLISH WHEN HE MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY AT AGE 9
BUT LAST MONTH THANKS
TO THE SUPPORT OF GREAT TEACHERS AND AN INNOVATIVE TUTORING PROGRAM HE
LED A MARCH OF HIS CLASSMATES THROUGH A CROWD OF CHEERING PARENTS AND
NEIGHBORS FROM THEIR HIGH SCHOOL TO THE POST OFFICE WHERE THEY MAILED
OFF THEIR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS
AND THIS SON OF A FACTORY WORKER JUST
FOUND OUT HE'S GOING TO COLLEGE THIS FALL
FIVE YEARS AGO WE SET OUT TO CHANGE THE ODDS FOR ALL OUR KIDS
WE
WORKED WITH LENDERS TO REFORM STUDENT LOANS AND TODAY MORE YOUNG
PEOPLE ARE EARNING COLLEGE DEGREES THAN EVER BEFORE
RACE TO THE TOP
WITH THE HELP OF GOVERNORS FROM BOTH PARTIES HAS HELPED STATES RAISE
EXPECTATIONS AND PERFORMANCE
TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS IN SCHOOLS FROM
TENNESSEE TO WASHINGTON DC ARE MAKING BIG STRIDES IN PREPARING
STUDENTS WITH THE SKILLS FOR THE NEW ECONOMY PROBLEM SOLVING CRITICAL
THINKING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING MATH
NOW SOME OF THIS CHANGE IS HARD
IT REQUIRES EVERYTHING FROM MORE
CHALLENGING CURRICULUMS AND MORE DEMANDING PARENTS TO BETTER SUPPORT
FOR TEACHERS AND NEW WAYS TO MEASURE HOW WELL OUR KIDS THINK NOT HOW
WELL THEY CAN FILL IN A BUBBLE ON A TEST
BUT IT IS WORTH IT AND IT IS
WORKING
THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE STILL NOT REACHING ENOUGH KIDS AND
WE'RE NOT REACHING THEM IN TIME
AND THAT HAS TO CHANGE
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE IN A
CHILD'S LIFE IS HIGH QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION
LAST YEAR I ASKED THIS
CONGRESS TO HELP STATES MAKE HIGH QUALITY PRE K AVAILABLE TO EVERY 4
YEAR OLD
AND AS A PARENT AS WELL AS A PRESIDENT I REPEAT THAT REQUEST
TONIGHT
BUT IN THE MEANTIME 30 STATES HAVE RAISED PRE K FUNDING ON
THEIR OWN
THEY KNOW WE CAN'T WAIT
SO JUST AS WE WORKED WITH STATES TO
REFORM OUR SCHOOLS THIS YEAR WE'LL INVEST IN NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH
STATES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN A RACE TO THE TOP FOR OUR
YOUNGEST CHILDREN
AND AS CONGRESS DECIDES WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO I'M
GOING TO PULL TOGETHER A COALITION OF ELECTED OFFICIALS BUSINESS
LEADERS AND PHILANTHROPISTS WILLING TO HELP MORE KIDS ACCESS THE HIGH
QUALITY PRE K THAT THEY NEED
IT IS RIGHT FOR AMERICA
WE NEED TO GET
THIS DONE
LAST YEAR I ALSO PLEDGED TO CONNECT 99 PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS TO
HIGH SPEED BROADBAND OVER THE NEXT 4 YEARS
TONIGHT I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE FCC AND COMPANIES LIKE APPLE MICROSOFT SPRINT
AND VERIZON WE'VE GOT A DOWN PAYMENT TO START CONNECTING MORE THAN
15 000 SCHOOLS AND 20 MILLION STUDENTS OVER THE NEXT 2 YEARS WITHOUT
ADDING A DIME TO THE DEFICIT
WE'RE WORKING TO REDESIGN HIGH SCHOOLS AND PARTNER THEM WITH COLLEGES
AND EMPLOYERS THAT OFFER THE REAL WORLD EDUCATION AND HANDS ON TRAINING
THAT CAN LEAD DIRECTLY TO A JOB AND CAREER
WE'RE SHAKING UP OUR SYSTEM
OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO GIVE PARENTS MORE INFORMATION AND COLLEGES MORE
INCENTIVE TO OFFER BETTER VALUE SO THAT NO MIDDLE CLASS KID IS PRICED
OUT OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION
WE'RE OFFERING MILLIONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAP THEIR MONTHLY STUDENT
LOAN PAYMENTS TO 10 PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME AND I WANT TO WORK WITH
CONGRESS TO SEE HOW WE CAN HELP EVEN MORE AMERICANS WHO FEEL TRAPPED BY
STUDENT LOAN DEBT
AND I'M REACHING OUT TO SOME OF AMERICA'S LEADING
FOUNDATIONS AND CORPORATIONS ON A NEW INITIATIVE TO HELP MORE YOUNG MEN
OF COLOR FACING ESPECIALLY TOUGH ODDS TO STAY ON TRACK AND REACH THEIR
FULL POTENTIAL
THE BOTTOM LINE IS MICHELLE AND I WANT EVERY CHILD TO HAVE THE SAME
CHANCE THIS COUNTRY GAVE US
BUT WE KNOW OUR OPPORTUNITY AGENDA WON'T
BE COMPLETE AND TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERING THE WORKFORCE TODAY
WILL SEE THE AMERICAN DREAM AS AN EMPTY PROMISE UNLESS WE ALSO DO MORE
TO MAKE SURE OUR ECONOMY HONORS THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND HARD WORK PAYS
OFF FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN
TODAY WOMEN MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OUR WORKFORCE BUT THEY STILL MAKE 77
CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR A MAN EARNS
THAT IS WRONG AND IN 2014 IT'S AN
EMBARRASSMENT
WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
SHE DESERVES TO
HAVE A BABY WITHOUT SACRIFICING HER JOB
A MOTHER DESERVES A DAY OFF TO
CARE FOR A SICK CHILD OR A SICK PARENT WITHOUT RUNNING INTO HARDSHIP
AND YOU KNOW WHAT A FATHER DOES TOO
IT IS TIME TO DO AWAY WITH
WORKPLACE POLICIES THAT BELONG IN A MAD MEN EPISODE
LAUGHTER THIS
YEAR LET'S ALL COME TOGETHER CONGRESS THE WHITE HOUSE BUSINESSES
FROM WALL STREET TO MAIN STREET TO GIVE EVERY WOMAN THE OPPORTUNITY SHE
DESERVES
BECAUSE I BELIEVE WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED AMERICA SUCCEEDS
NOW WOMEN HOLD A MAJORITY OF LOWER WAGE JOBS BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY
ONES STIFLED BY STAGNANT WAGES
AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE
WILL EARN MORE MONEY THAN OTHERS AND WE DON'T RESENT THOSE WHO BY
VIRTUE OF THEIR EFFORTS ACHIEVE INCREDIBLE SUCCESS
THAT'S WHAT
AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT
BUT AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY AGREE THAT NO ONE
WHO WORKS FULL TIME SHOULD EVER HAVE TO RAISE A FAMILY IN POVERTY
IN THE YEAR SINCE I ASKED THIS CONGRESS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE FIVE
STATES HAVE PASSED LAWS TO RAISE THEIRS
MANY BUSINESSES HAVE DONE IT
ON THEIR OWN
NICK CHUTE IS HERE TODAY WITH HIS BOSS JOHN SORANNO
JOHN'S AN OWNER OF PUNCH PIZZA IN MINNEAPOLIS AND NICK HELPS MAKE THE
DOUGH
LAUGHTER ONLY NOW HE MAKES MORE OF IT
LAUGHTER JOHN JUST
GAVE HIS EMPLOYEES A RAISE TO 10 BUCKS AN HOUR AND THAT'S A DECISION
THAT HAS EASED THEIR FINANCIAL STRESS AND BOOSTED THEIR MORALE
TONIGHT I ASK MORE OF AMERICA'S BUSINESS LEADERS TO FOLLOW JOHN'S LEAD
DO WHAT YOU CAN TO RAISE YOUR EMPLOYEES' WAGES
IT'S GOOD FOR THE
ECONOMY
IT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA
TO EVERY MAYOR GOVERNOR STATE
LEGISLATOR IN AMERICA I SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR CONGRESS TO
ACT AMERICANS WILL SUPPORT YOU IF YOU TAKE THIS ON
AND AS A CHIEF EXECUTIVE I INTEND TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE
PROFITABLE
CORPORATIONS LIKE COSTCO SEE HIGHER WAGES AS THE SMART WAY TO BOOST
PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE TURNOVER
WE SHOULD TOO
IN THE COMING WEEKS I
WILL ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRING FEDERAL CONTRACTORS TO PAY
THEIR FEDERALLY FUNDED EMPLOYEES A FAIR WAGE OF AT LEAST 10 DOLLARS AND
10 CENTS AN HOUR
BECAUSE IF YOU COOK OUR TROOPS' MEALS OR WASH THEIR
DISHES YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN POVERTY
OF COURSE TO REACH MILLIONS MORE CONGRESS DOES NEED TO GET ON BOARD
TODAY THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE IS WORTH ABOUT 20 PERCENT LESS THAN IT
WAS WHEN RONALD REAGAN FIRST STOOD HERE
AND TOM HARKIN AND GEORGE
MILLER HAVE A BILL TO FIX THAT BY LIFTING THE MINIMUM WAGE TO 10
DOLLARS AND 10 CENTS
IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER 10 10
THIS WILL HELP
FAMILIES
IT WILL GIVE BUSINESSES CUSTOMERS WITH MORE MONEY TO SPEND
IT DOES NOT INVOLVE ANY NEW BUREAUCRATIC PROGRAM
SO JOIN THE REST OF
THE COUNTRY
SAY YES
GIVE AMERICA A RAISE
GIVE THEM A RAISE
THERE ARE OTHER STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO HELP FAMILIES MAKE ENDS MEET AND
FEW ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING INEQUALITY AND HELPING FAMILIES PULL
THEMSELVES UP THROUGH HARD WORK THAN THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT
RIGHT NOW IT HELPS ABOUT HALF OF ALL PARENTS AT SOME POINT
THINK ABOUT
THAT IT HELPS ABOUT HALF OF ALL PARENTS IN AMERICA AT SOME POINT IN
THEIR LIVES
BUT I AGREE WITH REPUBLICANS LIKE SENATOR RUBIO THAT IT
DOESN'T DO ENOUGH FOR SINGLE WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE KIDS
SO LET'S WORK
TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN THE CREDIT REWARD WORK HELP MORE AMERICANS GET
AHEAD
LET'S DO MORE TO HELP AMERICANS SAVE FOR RETIREMENT
TODAY MOST
WORKERS DON'T HAVE A PENSION
A SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK OFTEN ISN'T
ENOUGH ON ITS OWN
AND WHILE THE STOCK MARKET HAS DOUBLED OVER THE LAST
5 YEARS THAT DOESN'T HELP FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE 401 K S
THAT'S WHY
TOMORROW I WILL DIRECT THE TREASURY TO CREATE A NEW WAY FOR WORKING
AMERICANS TO START THEIR OWN RETIREMENT SAVINGS MYI MYRA
IT'S A NEW SAVINGS BOND THAT ENCOURAGES FOLKS TO BUILD A NEST EGG
MYRA
GUARANTEES A DECENT RETURN WITH NO RISK OF LOSING WHAT YOU PUT IN
AND
IF THIS CONGRESS WANTS TO HELP WORK WITH ME TO FIX AN UPSIDE DOWN TAX
CODE THAT GIVES BIG TAX BREAKS TO HELP THE WEALTHY SAVE BUT DOES
LITTLE OR NOTHING FOR MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS
OFFER EVERY AMERICAN
ACCESS TO AN AUTOMATIC IRA ON THE JOB SO THEY CAN SAVE AT WORK JUST
LIKE EVERYBODY IN THIS CHAMBER CAN
AND SINCE THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT MANY FAMILIES MAKE IS THEIR
HOME SEND ME LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS TAXPAYERS FROM FOOTING THE BILL
FOR A HOUSING CRISIS EVER AGAIN AND KEEPS THE DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP
ALIVE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
ONE LAST POINT ON FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR DECADES FEW THINGS EXPOSED
HARD WORKING FAMILIES TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIP MORE THAN A BROKEN HEALTH
CARE SYSTEM
AND IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF
FIXING THAT
NOW A PREEXISTING CONDITION USED TO MEAN THAT SOMEONE
LIKE AMANDA SHELLEY A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT AND SINGLE MOM FROM
ARIZONA COULDN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE
BUT ON JANUARY 1 SHE GOT
COVERED
ON JANUARY 3 SHE FELT A SHARP PAIN
ON JANUARY 6 SHE HAD
EMERGENCY SURGERY
JUST ONE WEEK EARLIER AMANDA SAID AND THAT SURGERY
WOULD HAVE MEANT BANKRUPTCY
THAT'S WHAT HEALTH INSURANCE REFORM IS ALL ABOUT THE PEACE OF MIND
THAT IF MISFORTUNE STRIKES YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOSE EVERYTHING
ALREADY
BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT MORE THAN 3 MILLION AMERICANS UNDER
AGE 26 HAVE GAINED COVERAGE UNDER THEIR PARENT'S PLAN
MORE THAN 9
MILLION AMERICANS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE OR
MEDICAID COVERAGE
NINE MILLION
AND HERE'S ANOTHER NUMBER ZERO
BECAUSE OF THIS LAW NO AMERICAN NONE
ZERO CAN EVER AGAIN BE DROPPED OR DENIED COVERAGE FOR A PREEXISTING
CONDITION LIKE ASTHMA OR BACK PAIN OR CANCER
NO WOMAN CAN EVER BE
CHARGED MORE JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A WOMAN
AND WE DID ALL THIS WHILE
ADDING YEARS TO MEDICARE'S FINANCES KEEPING MEDICARE PREMIUMS FLAT
AND LOWERING PRESCRIPTION COSTS FOR MILLIONS OF SENIORS
NOW I DO NOT EXPECT TO CONVINCE MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS ON THE MERITS OF
THIS LAW
LAUGHTER BUT I KNOW THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT
INTERESTED IN REFIGHTING OLD BATTLES
SO AGAIN IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC
PLANS TO CUT COSTS COVER MORE PEOPLE INCREASE CHOICE TELL AMERICA
WHAT YOU'D DO DIFFERENTLY
LET'S SEE IF THE NUMBERS ADD UP
BUT LET'S
NOT HAVE ANOTHER 40 SOMETHING VOTES TO REPEAL A LAW THAT'S ALREADY
HELPING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LIKE AMANDA
THE FIRST 40 WERE PLENTY
LAUGHTER
WE ALL OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SAY WHAT WE'RE FOR NOT JUST
WHAT WE'RE AGAINST
AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE REAL IMPACT THIS LAW IS
HAVING JUST TALK TO GOVERNOR STEVE BESHEAR OF KENTUCKY WHO'S HERE
TONIGHT
NOW KENTUCKY IS NOT THE MOST LIBERAL PART OF THE COUNTRY
THAT'S NOT WHERE I GOT MY HIGHEST VOTE TOTALS
LAUGHTER BUT HE'S LIKE
A MAN POSSESSED WHEN IT COMES TO COVERING HIS COMMONWEALTH'S FAMILIES
THEY'RE OUR NEIGHBORS AND OUR FRIENDS HE SAID THEY'RE PEOPLE WE SHOP
AND GO TO CHURCH WITH FARMERS OUT ON THE TRACTOR GROCERY CLERKS
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO GO TO WORK EVERY MORNING PRAYING THEY DON'T GET SICK
NO ONE DESERVES TO LIVE THAT WAY
STEVE'S RIGHT
THAT'S WHY TONIGHT I ASK EVERY AMERICAN WHO KNOWS
SOMEONE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE TO HELP THEM GET COVERED BY MARCH 31
APPLAUSE HELP THEM GET COVERED
MOMS GET ON YOUR KIDS TO SIGN UP
KIDS CALL YOUR MOM AND WALK HER THROUGH THE APPLICATION
IT WILL GIVE
HER SOME PEACE OF MIND AND PLUS SHE'LL APPRECIATE HEARING FROM YOU
LAUGHTER
AFTER ALL THAT'S THE SPIRIT THAT HAS ALWAYS MOVED THIS NATION FORWARD
IT'S THE SPIRIT OF CITIZENSHIP THE RECOGNITION THAT THROUGH HARD WORK
AND RESPONSIBILITY WE CAN PURSUE OUR INDIVIDUAL DREAMS BUT STILL COME
TOGETHER AS ONE AMERICAN FAMILY TO MAKE SURE THE NEXT GENERATION CAN
PURSUE ITS DREAMS AS WELL
CITIZENSHIP MEANS STANDING UP FOR EVERYONE'S RIGHT TO VOTE
LAST YEAR
PART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS WEAKENED BUT CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICANS AND LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN IT
AND THE BIPARTISAN COMMISSION I APPOINTED CHAIRED BY MY CAMPAIGN
LAWYER AND GOVERNOR ROMNEY'S CAMPAIGN LAWYER CAME TOGETHER AND HAVE
OFFERED REFORMS SO THAT NO ONE HAS TO WAIT MORE THAN A HALF HOUR TO
VOTE
LET'S SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS
IT SHOULD BE THE POWER OF OUR VOTE
NOT THE SIZE OF OUR BANK ACCOUNTS THAT DRIVES OUR DEMOCRACY
CITIZENSHIP MEANS STANDING UP FOR THE LIVES THAT GUN VIOLENCE STEALS
FROM US EACH DAY
I'VE SEEN THE COURAGE OF PARENTS STUDENTS PASTORS
POLICE OFFICERS ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WHO SAY WE ARE NOT AFRAID AND
I INTEND TO KEEP TRYING WITH OR WITHOUT CONGRESS TO HELP STOP MORE
TRAGEDIES FROM VISITING INNOCENT AMERICANS IN OUR MOVIE THEATERS IN
OUR SHOPPING MALLS OR SCHOOLS LIKE SANDY HOOK
CITIZENSHIP DEMANDS A SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE PARTICIPATION IN THE
HARD WORK OF SELF GOVERNMENT AN OBLIGATION TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES
AND I KNOW THIS CHAMBER AGREES THAT FEW AMERICANS GIVE MORE TO THEIR
COUNTRY THAN OUR DIPLOMATS AND THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES
ARMED FORCES
THANK YOU
TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY TROOPS
AND CIVILIANS WHO RISK AND LAY DOWN THEIR LIVES TO KEEP US FREE THE
UNITED STATES IS MORE SECURE
WHEN I TOOK OFFICE NEARLY 180 000
AMERICANS WERE SERVING IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
TODAY ALL OUR TROOPS
ARE OUT OF IRAQ
MORE THAN 60 000 OF OUR TROOPS HAVE ALREADY COME HOME
FROM AFGHANISTAN
WITH AFGHAN FORCES NOW IN THE LEAD FOR THEIR OWN
SECURITY OUR TROOPS HAVE MOVED TO A SUPPORT ROLE
TOGETHER WITH OUR
ALLIES WE WILL COMPLETE OUR MISSION THERE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR AND
AMERICA'S LONGEST WAR WILL FINALLY BE OVER
AFTER 2014 WE WILL SUPPORT A UNIFIED AFGHANISTAN AS IT TAKES
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OWN FUTURE
IF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT SIGNS A
SECURITY AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE NEGOTIATED A SMALL FORCE OF AMERICANS
COULD REMAIN IN AFGHANISTAN WITH NATO ALLIES TO CARRY OUT TWO NARROW
MISSIONS TRAINING AND ASSISTING AFGHAN FORCES AND COUNTERTERRORISM
OPERATIONS TO PURSUE ANY REMNANTS OF AL QAIDA
FOR WHILE OUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH AFGHANISTAN WILL CHANGE ONE THING WILL NOT OUR
RESOLVE THAT TERRORISTS DO NOT LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST OUR COUNTRY
THE FACT IS THAT DANGER REMAINS
WHILE WE'VE PUT AL QAIDA'S CORE
LEADERSHIP ON A PATH TO DEFEAT THE THREAT HAS EVOLVED AS AL QAIDA
AFFILIATES AND OTHER EXTREMISTS TAKE ROOT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE
WORLD
IN YEMEN SOMALIA IRAQ MALI WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING WITH
PARTNERS TO DISRUPT AND DISABLE THOSE NETWORKS
IN SYRIA WE'LL SUPPORT
THE OPPOSITION THAT REJECTS THE AGENDA OF TERRORIST NETWORKS
HERE AT
HOME WE'LL KEEP STRENGTHENING OUR DEFENSES AND COMBAT NEW THREATS LIKE
CYBER ATTACKS
AND AS WE REFORM OUR DEFENSE BUDGET WE WILL HAVE TO
KEEP FAITH WITH OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AND INVEST IN THE
CAPABILITIES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN FUTURE MISSIONS
WE HAVE TO REMAIN VIGILANT
BUT I STRONGLY BELIEVE OUR LEADERSHIP AND
OUR SECURITY CANNOT DEPEND ON OUR OUTSTANDING MILITARY ALONE
AS
COMMANDER IN CHIEF I HAVE USED FORCE WHEN NEEDED TO PROTECT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I WILL NEVER HESITATE TO DO SO AS LONG AS I HOLD
THIS OFFICE
BUT I WILL NOT SEND OUR TROOPS INTO HARM'S WAY UNLESS IT
IS TRULY NECESSARY NOR WILL I ALLOW OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO BE MIRED
IN OPEN ENDED CONFLICTS
WE MUST FIGHT THE BATTLES THAT NEED TO BE
FOUGHT NOT THOSE THAT TERRORISTS PREFER FROM US LARGE SCALE
DEPLOYMENTS THAT DRAIN OUR STRENGTH AND MAY ULTIMATELY FEED EXTREMISM
SO EVEN AS WE ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE TERRORIST NETWORKS
THROUGH MORE TARGETED EFFORTS AND BY BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF OUR
FOREIGN PARTNERS AMERICA MUST MOVE OFF A PERMANENT WAR FOOTING
THAT'S
WHY I'VE IMPOSED PRUDENT LIMITS ON THE USE OF DRONES
FOR WE WILL NOT
BE SAFER IF PEOPLE ABROAD BELIEVE WE STRIKE WITHIN THEIR COUNTRIES
WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE CONSEQUENCE
THAT'S WHY WORKING WITH THIS CONGRESS I WILL REFORM OUR SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE VITAL WORK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY DEPENDS
ON PUBLIC CONFIDENCE HERE AND ABROAD THAT PRIVACY OF ORDINARY PEOPLE
IS NOT BEING VIOLATED
AND WITH THE AFGHAN WAR ENDING THIS NEEDS TO BE THE YEAR CONGRESS
LIFTS THE REMAINING RESTRICTIONS ON DETAINEE TRANSFERS AND WE CLOSE THE
PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY
BECAUSE WE COUNTER TERRORISM NOT JUST THROUGH
INTELLIGENCE AND MILITARY ACTIONS BUT BY REMAINING TRUE TO OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL IDEALS AND SETTING AN EXAMPLE FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD
YOU SEE IN A WORLD OF COMPLEX THREATS OUR SECURITY OUR LEADERSHIP
DEPENDS ON ALL ELEMENTS OF OUR POWER INCLUDING STRONG AND PRINCIPLED
DIPLOMACY
AMERICAN DIPLOMACY HAS RALLIED MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES TO
PREVENT NUCLEAR MATERIALS FROM FALLING INTO THE WRONG HANDS AND ALLOWED
US TO REDUCE OUR OWN RELIANCE ON COLD WAR STOCKPILES
AMERICAN
DIPLOMACY BACKED BY THE THREAT OF FORCE IS WHY SYRIA'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ARE BEING ELIMINATED
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO USHER
IN THE FUTURE THE SYRIAN PEOPLE DESERVE A FUTURE FREE OF DICTATORSHIP
TERROR AND FEAR
AS WE SPEAK AMERICAN DIPLOMACY IS SUPPORTING
ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS AS THEY ENGAGE IN THE DIFFICULT BUT NECESSARY
TALKS TO END THE CONFLICT THERE TO ACHIEVE DIGNITY AND AN INDEPENDENT
STATE FOR PALESTINIANS AND LASTING PEACE AND SECURITY FOR THE STATE OF
ISRAEL A JEWISH STATE THAT KNOWS AMERICA WILL ALWAYS BE AT THEIR SIDE
AND IT IS AMERICAN DIPLOMACY BACKED BY PRESSURE THAT HAS HALTED THE
PROGRESS OF IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND ROLLED BACK PARTS OF THAT
PROGRAM FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN A DECADE
AS WE GATHER HERE TONIGHT
IRAN HAS BEGUN TO ELIMINATE ITS STOCKPILE OF HIGHER LEVELS OF ENRICHED
URANIUM
IT'S NOT INSTALLING ADVANCED CENTRIFUGES
UNPRECEDENTED
INSPECTIONS HELP THE WORLD VERIFY EVERY DAY THAT IRAN IS NOT BUILDING A
BOMB
AND WITH OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS WE'RE ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATIONS
TO SEE IF WE CAN PEACEFULLY ACHIEVE A GOAL WE ALL SHARE PREVENTING
IRAN FROM OBTAINING A NUCLEAR WEAPON
THESE NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE DIFFICULT
THEY MAY NOT SUCCEED
WE ARE
CLEAR EYED ABOUT IRAN'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
HIZBALLAH WHICH THREATENS OUR ALLIES
AND WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT THE
MISTRUST BETWEEN OUR NATIONS MISTRUST THAT CANNOT BE WISHED AWAY
BUT
THESE NEGOTIATIONS DON'T RELY ON TRUST
ANY LONG TERM DEAL WE AGREE TO
MUST BE BASED ON VERIFIABLE ACTION THAT CONVINCES US AND THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IRAN IS NOT BUILDING A NUCLEAR BOMB
IF
JOHN F
KENNEDY AND RONALD REAGAN COULD NEGOTIATE WITH THE SOVIET UNION
THEN SURELY A STRONG AND CONFIDENT AMERICA CAN NEGOTIATE WITH LESS
POWERFUL ADVERSARIES TODAY
THE SANCTIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE HELPED MAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY
POSSIBLE
BUT LET ME BE CLEAR IF THIS CONGRESS SENDS ME A NEW
SANCTIONS BILL NOW THAT THREATENS TO DERAIL THESE TALKS I WILL VETO IT
FOR THE SAKE OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY WE MUST GIVE DIPLOMACY A CHANCE
TO SUCCEED
IF IRAN'S LEADERS DO NOT SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY THEN I
WILL BE THE FIRST TO CALL FOR MORE SANCTIONS AND STAND READY TO
EXERCISE ALL OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE IRAN DOES NOT BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON
BUT IF IRAN'S LEADERS DO SEIZE THE CHANCE AND WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH
THEN IRAN COULD TAKE AN IMPORTANT STEP TO REJOIN THE COMMUNITY OF
NATIONS AND WE WILL HAVE RESOLVED ONE OF THE LEADING SECURITY
CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME WITHOUT THE RISKS OF WAR
NOW FINALLY LET'S REMEMBER THAT OUR LEADERSHIP IS DEFINED NOT JUST BY
OUR DEFENSE AGAINST THREATS BUT BY THE ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO DO
GOOD AND PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING AROUND THE GLOBE TO FORGE GREATER
COOPERATION TO EXPAND NEW MARKETS TO FREE PEOPLE FROM FEAR AND WANT
AND NO ONE IS BETTER POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE
OPPORTUNITIES THAN AMERICA
OUR ALLIANCE WITH EUROPE REMAINS THE STRONGEST THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN
FROM TUNISIA TO BURMA WE'RE SUPPORTING THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO DO THE
HARD WORK OF BUILDING DEMOCRACY
IN UKRAINE WE STAND FOR THE PRINCIPLE
THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES FREELY AND
PEACEFULLY AND TO HAVE A SAY IN THEIR COUNTRY'S FUTURE
ACROSS AFRICA
WE'RE BRINGING TOGETHER BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS TO DOUBLE ACCESS TO
ELECTRICITY AND HELP END EXTREME POVERTY
IN THE AMERICAS WE'RE
BUILDING NEW TIES OF COMMERCE BUT WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING CULTURAL AND
EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS
ON THE ASIA PACIFIC WHERE WE SUPPORT OUR ALLIES SHAPE A FUTURE OF
GREATER SECURITY AND PROSPERITY AND EXTEND A HAND TO THOSE DEVASTATED
BY DISASTER AS WE DID IN THE PHILIPPINES WHEN OUR MARINES AND
CIVILIANS RUSHED TO AID THOSE BATTERED BY A TYPHOON AND WHO WERE
GREETED WITH WORDS LIKE WE WILL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS AND GOD
BLESS AMERICA
WE DO THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY HELP PROMOTE OUR LONG TERM SECURITY
AND WE DO THEM BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE INHERENT DIGNITY AND EQUALITY
OF EVERY HUMAN BEING REGARDLESS OF RACE OR RELIGION CREED OR SEXUAL
ORIENTATION
AND NEXT WEEK THE WORLD WILL SEE ONE EXPRESSION OF THAT
COMMITMENT WHEN TEAM U S A
MARCHES THE RED WHITE AND BLUE INTO THE
OLYMPIC STADIUM AND BRINGS HOME THE GOLD
LAUGHTER
AUDIENCE MEMBERS
U S A U S A U S A
THE PRESIDENT
MY FELLOW AMERICANS NO OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD DOES
WHAT WE DO
ON EVERY ISSUE THE WORLD TURNS TO US NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE
OF THE SIZE OF OUR ECONOMY OR OUR MILITARY MIGHT BUT BECAUSE OF THE
IDEALS WE STAND FOR AND THE BURDENS WE BEAR TO ADVANCE THEM
NO ONE
KNOWS THIS BETTER THAN THOSE WHO SERVE IN UNIFORM
AS THIS TIME OF WAR DRAWS TO A CLOSE A NEW GENERATION OF HEROES
RETURNS TO CIVILIAN LIFE
WE'LL KEEP SLASHING THAT BACKLOG SO OUR
VETERANS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS THEY'VE EARNED AND OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS
RECEIVE THE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED
WE'LL KEEP WORKING TO HELP ALL OUR VETERANS TRANSLATE THEIR SKILLS AND
LEADERSHIP INTO JOBS HERE AT HOME
AND WE WILL ALL CONTINUE TO JOIN
FORCES TO HONOR AND SUPPORT OUR REMARKABLE MILITARY FAMILIES
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES I'VE COME TO KNOW
I FIRST
MET CORY REMSBURG A PROUD ARMY RANGER AT OMAHA BEACH ON THE 65TH
ANNIVERSARY OF D DAY
ALONG WITH SOME OF HIS FELLOW RANGERS HE WALKED
ME THROUGH THE PROGRAM AND THE CEREMONY
HE WAS A STRONG IMPRESSIVE
YOUNG MAN HAD AN EASY MANNER HE WAS SHARP AS A TACK
AND WE JOKED
AROUND AND TOOK PICTURES AND I TOLD HIM TO STAY IN TOUCH
A FEW MONTHS LATER ON HIS 10TH DEPLOYMENT CORY WAS NEARLY KILLED BY A
MASSIVE ROADSIDE BOMB IN AFGHANISTAN
HIS COMRADES FOUND HIM IN A CANAL
FACE DOWN UNDERWATER SHRAPNEL IN HIS BRAIN
FOR MONTHS HE LAY IN A
COMA
AND THE NEXT TIME I MET HIM IN THE HOSPITAL HE COULDN'T SPEAK
COULD BARELY MOVE
OVER THE YEARS HE'S ENDURED DOZENS OF SURGERIES AND
PROCEDURES HOURS OF GRUELING REHAB EVERY DAY
EVEN NOW CORY IS STILL BLIND IN ONE EYE STILL STRUGGLES ON HIS LEFT
SIDE
BUT SLOWLY STEADILY WITH THE SUPPORT OF CAREGIVERS LIKE HIS DAD
CRAIG AND THE COMMUNITY AROUND HIM CORY HAS GROWN STRONGER
AND DAY BY
DAY HE'S LEARNED TO SPEAK AGAIN AND STAND AGAIN AND WALK AGAIN
AND
HE'S WORKING TOWARD THE DAY WHEN HE CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY AGAIN
MY
RECOVERY HAS NOT BEEN EASY HE SAYS
NOTHING IN LIFE THAT'S WORTH
ANYTHING IS EASY CORY IS HERE TONIGHT
AND LIKE THE ARMY HE LOVES
LIKE THE AMERICA HE SERVES SERGEANT FIRST CLASS CORY REMSBURG NEVER
GIVES UP AND HE DOES NOT QUIT
CORY
MY FELLOW AMERICANS MEN AND WOMEN LIKE CORY REMIND US THAT AMERICA HAS
NEVER COME EASY
OUR FREEDOM OUR DEMOCRACY HAS NEVER BEEN EASY
SOMETIMES WE STUMBLE WE MAKE MISTAKES WE GET FRUSTRATED OR
DISCOURAGED
BUT FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS WE HAVE PUT THOSE THINGS
ASIDE AND PLACED OUR COLLECTIVE SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL OF PROGRESS TO
CREATE AND BUILD AND EXPAND THE POSSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT
TO FREE OTHER NATIONS FROM TYRANNY AND FEAR TO PROMOTE JUSTICE AND
FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW SO THAT THE WORDS SET TO PAPER BY
OUR FOUNDERS ARE MADE REAL FOR EVERY CITIZEN
THE AMERICA WE WANT FOR
OUR KIDS A RISING AMERICA WHERE HONEST WORK IS PLENTIFUL AND
COMMUNITIES ARE STRONG WHERE PROSPERITY IS WIDELY SHARED AND
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL LETS US GO AS FAR AS OUR DREAMS AND TOIL WILL TAKE
US NONE OF IT IS EASY
BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER IF WE SUMMON WHAT IS
BEST IN US THE WAY CORY SUMMONED WHAT IS BEST IN HIM WITH OUR FEET
PLANTED FIRMLY IN TODAY BUT OUR EYES CAST TOWARD TOMORROW I KNOW IT
IS WITHIN OUR REACH
BELIEVE IT
GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
BARACK OBAMA
JANUARY 20 2015
THE PRESIDENT
MR
SPEAKER MR
VICE PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MY
FELLOW AMERICANS WE ARE 15 YEARS INTO THIS NEW CENTURY
FIFTEEN YEARS
THAT DAWNED WITH TERROR TOUCHING OUR SHORES THAT UNFOLDED WITH A NEW
GENERATION FIGHTING TWO LONG AND COSTLY WARS THAT SAW A VICIOUS
RECESSION SPREAD ACROSS OUR NATION AND THE WORLD
IT HAS BEEN AND STILL
IS A HARD TIME FOR MANY
BUT TONIGHT WE TURN THE PAGE
TONIGHT AFTER A BREAKTHROUGH YEAR FOR
AMERICA OUR ECONOMY IS GROWING AND CREATING JOBS AT THE FASTEST PACE
SINCE 1999
OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS NOW LOWER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE
FINANCIAL CRISIS
MORE OF OUR KIDS ARE GRADUATING THAN EVER BEFORE
MORE OF OUR PEOPLE ARE INSURED THAN EVER BEFORE
AND WE ARE AS FREE
FROM THE GRIP OF FOREIGN OIL AS WE'VE BEEN IN ALMOST 30 YEARS
TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 9 11 OUR COMBAT MISSION IN
AFGHANISTAN IS OVER
SIX YEARS AGO NEARLY 180 000 AMERICAN TROOPS
SERVED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
TODAY FEWER THAN 15 000 REMAIN
AND WE
SALUTE THE COURAGE AND SACRIFICE OF EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS 9 11
GENERATION WHO HAS SERVED TO KEEP US SAFE
WE ARE HUMBLED AND GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR SERVICE
AMERICA FOR ALL THAT WE HAVE ENDURED FOR ALL THE GRIT AND HARD WORK
REQUIRED TO COME BACK FOR ALL THE TASKS THAT LIE AHEAD KNOW THIS THE
SHADOW OF CRISIS HAS PASSED AND THE STATE OF THE UNION IS STRONG
AT THIS MOMENT WITH A GROWING ECONOMY SHRINKING DEFICITS BUSTLING
INDUSTRY BOOMING ENERGY PRODUCTION WE HAVE RISEN FROM RECESSION FREER
TO WRITE OUR OWN FUTURE THAN ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH
IT'S NOW UP TO
US TO CHOOSE WHO WE WANT TO BE OVER THE NEXT 15 YEARS AND FOR DECADES
TO COME
WILL WE ACCEPT AN ECONOMY WHERE ONLY A FEW OF US DO SPECTACULARLY WELL
OR WILL WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO AN ECONOMY THAT GENERATES RISING INCOMES
AND CHANCES FOR EVERYONE WHO MAKES THE EFFORT
WILL WE APPROACH THE WORLD FEARFUL AND REACTIVE DRAGGED INTO COSTLY
CONFLICTS THAT STRAIN OUR MILITARY AND SET BACK OUR STANDING OR WILL
WE LEAD WISELY USING ALL ELEMENTS OF OUR POWER TO DEFEAT NEW THREATS
AND PROTECT OUR PLANET
WILL WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE SORTED INTO FACTIONS AND TURNED AGAINST
ONE ANOTHER OR WILL WE RECAPTURE THE SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE THAT HAS
ALWAYS PROPELLED AMERICA FORWARD
IN 2 WEEKS I WILL SEND THIS CONGRESS A BUDGET FILLED WITH IDEAS THAT
ARE PRACTICAL NOT PARTISAN
AND IN THE MONTHS AHEAD I'LL CRISSCROSS
THE COUNTRY MAKING A CASE FOR THOSE IDEAS
SO TONIGHT I WANT TO FOCUS
LESS ON A CHECKLIST OF PROPOSALS AND FOCUS MORE ON THE VALUES AT STAKE
IN THE CHOICES BEFORE US
IT BEGINS WITH OUR ECONOMY
SEVEN YEARS AGO REBEKAH AND BEN ERLER OF
MINNEAPOLIS WERE NEWLYWEDS
LAUGHTER SHE WAITED TABLES
HE WORKED
CONSTRUCTION
THEIR FIRST CHILD JACK WAS ON THE WAY
THEY WERE YOUNG
AND IN LOVE IN AMERICA
AND IT DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
IF
ONLY WE HAD KNOWN REBEKAH WROTE TO ME LAST SPRING WHAT WAS ABOUT TO
HAPPEN TO THE HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION MARKET AS THE CRISIS WORSENED
BEN'S BUSINESS DRIED UP SO HE TOOK WHAT JOBS HE COULD FIND EVEN IF
THEY KEPT HIM ON THE ROAD FOR LONG STRETCHES OF TIME
REBEKAH TOOK OUT
STUDENT LOANS AND ENROLLED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND RETRAINED FOR A NEW
CAREER
THEY SACRIFICED FOR EACH OTHER
AND SLOWLY IT PAID OFF
THEY
BOUGHT THEIR FIRST HOME
THEY HAD A SECOND SON HENRY
REBEKAH GOT A
BETTER JOB AND THEN A RAISE
BEN IS BACK IN CONSTRUCTION AND HOME FOR
DINNER EVERY NIGHT
IT IS AMAZING REBEKAH WROTE WHAT YOU CAN BOUNCE BACK FROM WHEN YOU
HAVE TO
WE ARE A STRONG TIGHT KNIT FAMILY WHO HAS MADE IT
THROUGH SOME VERY VERY HARD TIMES WE ARE A STRONG TIGHT KNIT FAMILY
WHO HAS MADE IT THROUGH SOME VERY VERY HARD TIMES
AMERICA REBEKAH AND BEN'S STORY IS OUR STORY
THEY REPRESENT THE
MILLIONS WHO HAVE WORKED HARD AND SCRIMPED AND SACRIFICED AND RETOOLED
YOU ARE THE REASON THAT I RAN FOR THIS OFFICE
YOU ARE THE PEOPLE I WAS
THINKING OF 6 YEARS AGO TODAY IN THE DARKEST MONTHS OF THE CRISIS
WHEN I STOOD ON THE STEPS OF THIS CAPITOL AND PROMISED WE WOULD REBUILD
OUR ECONOMY ON A NEW FOUNDATION
AND IT HAS BEEN YOUR RESILIENCE YOUR
EFFORT THAT HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR OUR COUNTRY TO EMERGE STRONGER
WE BELIEVED WE COULD REVERSE THE TIDE OF OUTSOURCING AND DRAW NEW JOBS
TO OUR SHORES
AND OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED
MORE THAN 11 MILLION NEW JOBS
WE BELIEVED WE COULD REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND PROTECT
OUR PLANET
AND TODAY AMERICA IS NUMBER ONE IN OIL AND GAS
AMERICA IS
NUMBER ONE IN WIND POWER
EVERY 3 WEEKS WE BRING ONLINE AS MUCH SOLAR
POWER AS WE DID IN ALL OF 2008
AND THANKS TO LOWER GAS PRICES AND
HIGHER FUEL STANDARDS THE TYPICAL FAMILY THIS YEAR SHOULD SAVE ABOUT
750 AT THE PUMP
WE BELIEVED WE COULD PREPARE OUR KIDS FOR A MORE COMPETITIVE WORLD
AND
TODAY OUR YOUNGER STUDENTS HAVE EARNED THE HIGHEST MATH AND READING
SCORES ON RECORD
OUR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE HAS HIT AN ALLTIME
HIGH
MORE AMERICANS FINISH COLLEGE THAN EVER BEFORE
WE BELIEVED THAT SENSIBLE REGULATIONS COULD PREVENT ANOTHER CRISIS
SHIELD FAMILIES FROM RUIN AND ENCOURAGE FAIR COMPETITION
TODAY WE
HAVE NEW TOOLS TO STOP TAXPAYER FUNDED BAILOUTS AND A NEW CONSUMER
WATCHDOG TO PROTECT US FROM PREDATORY LENDING AND ABUSIVE CREDIT CARD
PRACTICES
AND IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE ABOUT 10 MILLION UNINSURED
AMERICANS FINALLY GAINED THE SECURITY OF HEALTH COVERAGE
AT EVERY STEP WE WERE TOLD OUR GOALS WERE MISGUIDED OR TOO AMBITIOUS
THAT WE WOULD CRUSH JOBS AND EXPLODE DEFICITS
INSTEAD WE'VE SEEN THE
FASTEST ECONOMIC GROWTH IN OVER A DECADE OUR DEFICITS CUT BY TWO
THIRDS A STOCK MARKET THAT HAS DOUBLED AND HEALTH CARE INFLATION AT
ITS LOWEST RATE IN 50 YEARS
THIS IS GOOD NEWS PEOPLE
LAUGHTER
SO THE VERDICT IS CLEAR
MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS WORKS
EXPANDING
OPPORTUNITY WORKS
AND THESE POLICIES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AS LONG AS
POLITICS DON'T GET IN THE WAY
WE CAN'T SLOW DOWN BUSINESSES OR PUT OUR
ECONOMY AT RISK WITH GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS OR FISCAL SHOWDOWNS
WE CAN'T
PUT THE SECURITY OF FAMILIES AT RISK BY TAKING AWAY THEIR HEALTH
INSURANCE OR UNRAVELING THE NEW RULES ON WALL STREET OR REFIGHTING PAST
BATTLES ON IMMIGRATION WHEN WE'VE GOT TO FIX A BROKEN SYSTEM
AND IF A
BILL COMES TO MY DESK THAT TRIES TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS I WILL VETO
IT
IT WILL HAVE EARNED MY VETO
TODAY THANKS TO A GROWING ECONOMY THE RECOVERY IS TOUCHING MORE AND
MORE LIVES
WAGES ARE FINALLY STARTING TO RISE AGAIN
WE KNOW THAT MORE
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS PLAN TO RAISE THEIR EMPLOYEES' PAY THAN AT ANY
TIME SINCE 2007
BUT HERE'S THE THING THOSE OF US HERE TONIGHT WE
NEED TO SET OUR SIGHTS HIGHER THAN JUST MAKING SURE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T
SCREW THINGS UP LAUGHTER THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HALT THE PROGRESS
WE'RE MAKING
WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST DO NO HARM
TONIGHT
TOGETHER LET'S DO MORE TO RESTORE THE LINK BETWEEN HARD WORK AND
GROWING OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN
BECAUSE FAMILIES LIKE REBEKAH'S STILL NEED OUR HELP
SHE AND BEN ARE
WORKING AS HARD AS EVER BUT THEY'VE HAD TO FOREGO VACATIONS AND A NEW
CAR SO THAT THEY CAN PAY OFF STUDENT LOANS AND SAVE FOR RETIREMENT
FRIDAY NIGHT PIZZA THAT'S A BIG SPLURGE
BASIC CHILDCARE FOR JACK AND
HENRY COSTS MORE THAN THEIR MORTGAGE AND ALMOST AS MUCH AS A YEAR AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA
LIKE MILLIONS OF HARD WORKING AMERICANS
REBEKAH ISN'T ASKING FOR A HANDOUT BUT SHE IS ASKING THAT WE LOOK FOR
MORE WAYS TO HELP FAMILIES GET AHEAD
AND IN FACT AT EVERY MOMENT OF ECONOMIC CHANGE THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY
THIS COUNTRY HAS TAKEN BOLD ACTION TO ADAPT TO NEW CIRCUMSTANCES AND TO
MAKE SURE EVERYONE GETS A FAIR SHOT
WE SET UP WORKER PROTECTIONS
SOCIAL SECURITY MEDICARE MEDICAID TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM THE
HARSHEST ADVERSITY
WE GAVE OUR CITIZENS SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE INTERNET TOOLS THEY NEEDED TO GO AS FAR AS
THEIR EFFORTS AND THEIR DREAMS WILL TAKE THEM
THAT'S WHAT MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS IS THE IDEA THAT THIS COUNTRY DOES
BEST WHEN EVERYONE GETS THEIR FAIR SHOT EVERYONE DOES THEIR FAIR SHARE
EVERYONE PLAYS BY THE SAME SET OF RULES
WE DON'T JUST WANT EVERYONE TO
SHARE IN AMERICA'S SUCCESS WE WANT EVERYONE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR
SUCCESS
SO WHAT DOES MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS REQUIRE IN OUR TIME FIRST MIDDLE
CLASS ECONOMICS MEANS HELPING WORKING FAMILIES FEEL MORE SECURE IN A
WORLD OF CONSTANT CHANGE
THAT MEANS HELPING FOLKS AFFORD CHILDCARE
COLLEGE HEALTH CARE A HOME RETIREMENT
AND MY BUDGET WILL ADDRESS
EACH OF THESE ISSUES LOWERING THE TAXES OF WORKING FAMILIES AND
PUTTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS BACK INTO THEIR POCKETS EACH YEAR
HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE
DURING WORLD WAR II WHEN MEN LIKE MY GRANDFATHER
WENT OFF TO WAR HAVING WOMEN LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER IN THE WORKFORCE WAS
A NATIONAL SECURITY PRIORITY SO THIS COUNTRY PROVIDED UNIVERSAL
CHILDCARE
IN TODAY'S ECONOMY WHEN HAVING BOTH PARENTS IN THE
WORKFORCE IS AN ECONOMIC NECESSITY FOR MANY FAMILIES WE NEED
AFFORDABLE HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE MORE THAN EVER
IT'S NOT A NICE TO HAVE IT'S A MUST HAVE
SO IT'S TIME WE STOP
TREATING CHILDCARE AS A SIDE ISSUE OR AS A WOMEN'S ISSUE AND TREAT IT
LIKE THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC PRIORITY THAT IT IS FOR ALL OF US
AND
THAT'S WHY MY PLAN WILL MAKE QUALITY CHILDCARE MORE AVAILABLE AND MORE
AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY MIDDLE CLASS AND LOW INCOME FAMILY WITH YOUNG
CHILDREN IN AMERICA BY CREATING MORE SLOTS AND A NEW TAX CUT OF UP TO
3 000 PER CHILD PER YEAR
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE
TODAY WE ARE THE ONLY ADVANCED COUNTRY ON
EARTH THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE PAID SICK LEAVE OR PAID MATERNITY LEAVE TO
OUR WORKERS
FORTY THREE MILLION WORKERS HAVE NO PAID SICK LEAVE 43
MILLION
THINK ABOUT THAT
AND THAT FORCES TOO MANY PARENTS TO MAKE THE
GUT WRENCHING CHOICE BETWEEN A PAYCHECK AND A SICK KID AT HOME
SO I'LL
BE TAKING NEW ACTION TO HELP STATES ADOPT PAID LEAVE LAWS OF THEIR OWN
AND SINCE PAID SICK LEAVE WON WHERE IT WAS ON THE BALLOT LAST NOVEMBER
LET'S PUT IT TO A VOTE RIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON
SEND ME A BILL THAT
GIVES EVERY WORKER IN AMERICA THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN 7 DAYS OF PAID
SICK LEAVE
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
APPLAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO
OF COURSE NOTHING HELPS FAMILIES MAKE ENDS MEET LIKE HIGHER WAGES
THAT'S WHY THIS CONGRESS STILL NEEDS TO PASS A LAW THAT MAKES SURE A
WOMAN IS PAID THE SAME AS A MAN FOR DOING THE SAME WORK
I MEAN IT'S
2015
LAUGHTER IT'S TIME
WE STILL NEED TO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES GET
THE OVERTIME THEY'VE EARNED
AND TO EVERYONE IN THIS CONGRESS WHO STILL
REFUSES TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE I SAY THIS IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE YOU
COULD WORK FULL TIME AND SUPPORT A FAMILY ON LESS THAN 15 000 A YEAR
TRY IT
IF NOT VOTE TO GIVE MILLIONS OF THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN
AMERICA A RAISE
NOW THESE IDEAS WON'T MAKE EVERYBODY RICH WON'T RELIEVE EVERY
HARDSHIP
THAT'S NOT THE JOB OF GOVERNMENT
TO GIVE WORKING FAMILIES A
FAIR SHOT WE STILL NEED MORE EMPLOYERS TO SEE BEYOND NEXT QUARTER'S
EARNINGS AND RECOGNIZE THAT INVESTING IN THEIR WORKFORCE IS IN THEIR
COMPANY'S LONG TERM INTEREST
WE STILL NEED LAWS THAT STRENGTHEN RATHER
THAN WEAKEN UNIONS AND GIVE AMERICAN WORKERS A VOICE
BUT YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE CHILDCARE AND SICK LEAVE AND EQUAL PAY
THINGS LIKE LOWER MORTGAGE PREMIUMS AND A HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE THESE
IDEAS WILL MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF
FAMILIES
THAT'S A FACT
AND THAT'S WHAT ALL OF US REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS ALIKE WERE SENT HERE TO DO
NOW SECOND TO MAKE SURE FOLKS KEEP EARNING HIGHER WAGES DOWN THE ROAD
WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO HELP AMERICANS UPGRADE THEIR SKILLS
AMERICA
THRIVED IN THE 20TH CENTURY BECAUSE WE MADE HIGH SCHOOL FREE SENT A
GENERATION OF GIS TO COLLEGE TRAINED THE BEST WORKFORCE IN THE WORLD
WE WERE AHEAD OF THE CURVE
BUT OTHER COUNTRIES CAUGHT ON
AND IN A
21ST CENTURY ECONOMY THAT REWARDS KNOWLEDGE LIKE NEVER BEFORE WE NEED
TO UP OUR GAME
WE NEED TO DO MORE
BY THE END OF THIS DECADE TWO IN THREE JOB OPENINGS WILL REQUIRE SOME
HIGHER EDUCATION TWO IN THREE
AND YET WE STILL LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE
TOO MANY BRIGHT STRIVING AMERICANS ARE PRICED OUT OF THE EDUCATION
THEY NEED
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THEM AND IT'S SURE NOT SMART FOR OUR
FUTURE
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SENDING THIS CONGRESS A BOLD NEW PLAN TO
LOWER THE COST OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO ZERO
KEEP IN MIND 40 PERCENT OF OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS CHOOSE COMMUNITY
COLLEGE
SOME ARE YOUNG AND STARTING OUT
SOME ARE OLDER AND LOOKING
FOR A BETTER JOB
SOME ARE VETERANS AND SINGLE PARENTS TRYING TO
TRANSITION BACK INTO THE JOB MARKET
WHOEVER YOU ARE THIS PLAN IS YOUR
CHANCE TO GRADUATE READY FOR THE NEW ECONOMY WITHOUT A LOAD OF DEBT
UNDERSTAND YOU'VE GOT TO EARN IT
YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR GRADES UP
AND GRADUATE ON TIME
TENNESSEE A STATE WITH REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP AND CHICAGO A CITY WITH
DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP ARE SHOWING THAT FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS
POSSIBLE
I WANT TO SPREAD THAT IDEA ALL ACROSS AMERICA SO THAT 2 YEARS
OF COLLEGE BECOMES AS FREE AND UNIVERSAL IN AMERICA AS HIGH SCHOOL IS
TODAY
LET'S STAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE
AND I WANT TO WORK WITH THIS
CONGRESS TO MAKE SURE THOSE ALREADY BURDENED WITH STUDENT LOANS CAN
REDUCE THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENTS SO THAT STUDENT DEBT DOESN'T DERAIL
ANYONE'S DREAMS
THANKS TO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S GREAT WORK TO UPDATE OUR JOB TRAINING
SYSTEM WE'RE CONNECTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH LOCAL EMPLOYERS TO
TRAIN WORKERS TO FILL HIGH PAYING JOBS LIKE CODING AND NURSING AND
ROBOTICS
TONIGHT I'M ALSO ASKING MORE BUSINESSES TO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF
COMPANIES LIKE CVS AND UPS AND OFFER MORE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS AND PAID
APPRENTICESHIPS OPPORTUNITIES THAT GIVE WORKERS THE CHANCE TO EARN
HIGHER PAYING JOBS EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE A HIGHER EDUCATION
AND AS A NEW GENERATION OF VETERANS COMES HOME WE OWE THEM EVERY
OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM THEY HELPED DEFEND
ALREADY
WE'VE MADE STRIDES TOWARDS ENSURING THAT EVERY VETERAN HAS ACCESS TO
THE HIGHEST QUALITY CARE
WE'RE SLASHING THE BACKLOG THAT HAD TOO MANY
VETERANS WAITING YEARS TO GET THE BENEFITS THEY NEED
AND WE'RE MAKING
IT EASIER FOR VETS TO TRANSLATE THEIR TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE INTO
CIVILIAN JOBS
AND JOINING FORCES THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED BY
MICHELLE AND JILL BIDEN APPLAUSE THANK YOU MICHELLE THANK YOU
JILL HAS HELPED NEARLY 700 000 VETERANS AND MILITARY SPOUSES GET A NEW
JOB
SO TO EVERY CEO IN AMERICA LET ME REPEAT IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY
WHO'S GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE AND DONE RIGHT HIRE A VETERAN
FINALLY AS WE BETTER TRAIN OUR WORKERS WE NEED THE NEW ECONOMY TO
KEEP CHURNING OUT HIGH WAGE JOBS FOR OUR WORKERS TO FILL
SINCE 2010
AMERICA HAS PUT MORE PEOPLE BACK TO WORK THAN EUROPE JAPAN AND ALL
ADVANCED ECONOMIES COMBINED
OUR MANUFACTURERS HAVE ADDED ALMOST 800 000 NEW JOBS
SOME OF OUR
BEDROCK SECTORS LIKE OUR AUTO INDUSTRY ARE BOOMING
BUT THERE ARE
ALSO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO WORK IN JOBS THAT DIDN'T EVEN EXIST 10
OR 20 YEARS AGO JOBS AT COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE AND EBAY AND TESLA
SO NO ONE KNOWS FOR CERTAIN WHICH INDUSTRIES WILL GENERATE THE JOBS OF
THE FUTURE
BUT WE DO KNOW WE WANT THEM HERE IN AMERICA
WE KNOW THAT
AND THAT'S WHY THE THIRD PART OF MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMICS IS ALL ABOUT
BUILDING THE MOST COMPETITIVE ECONOMY ANYWHERE THE PLACE WHERE
BUSINESSES WANT TO LOCATE AND HIRE
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUSINESSES NEED 21ST CENTURY INFRASTRUCTURE
MODERN PORTS AND STRONGER BRIDGES FASTER TRAINS AND THE FASTEST
INTERNET
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS USED TO AGREE ON THIS
SO LET'S SET
OUR SIGHTS HIGHER THAN A SINGLE OIL PIPELINE
LET'S PASS A BIPARTISAN
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THAT COULD CREATE MORE THAN 30 TIMES AS MANY JOBS
PER YEAR AND MAKE THIS COUNTRY STRONGER FOR DECADES TO COME
LET'S DO
IT
LET'S GET IT DONE
APPLAUSE LET'S GET IT DONE
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUSINESSES INCLUDING SMALL BUSINESSES NEED TO
SELL MORE AMERICAN PRODUCTS OVERSEAS
TODAY OUR BUSINESSES EXPORT MORE
THAN EVER AND EXPORTERS TEND TO PAY THEIR WORKERS HIGHER WAGES
BUT AS
WE SPEAK CHINA WANTS TO WRITE THE RULES FOR THE WORLD'S FASTEST
GROWING REGION
THAT WOULD PUT OUR WORKERS AND OUR BUSINESSES AT A
DISADVANTAGE
WHY WOULD WE LET THAT HAPPEN WE SHOULD WRITE THOSE RULES
WE SHOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD
AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING BOTH
PARTIES TO GIVE ME TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY TO PROTECT AMERICAN
WORKERS WITH STRONG NEW TRADE DEALS FROM ASIA TO EUROPE THAT AREN'T
JUST FREE BUT ARE ALSO FAIR
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
LOOK I'M THE FIRST ONE TO ADMIT THAT PAST TRADE DEALS HAVEN'T ALWAYS
LIVED UP TO THE HYPE AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE GONE AFTER COUNTRIES THAT
BREAK THE RULES AT OUR EXPENSE
BUT 95 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S CUSTOMERS
LIVE OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS
WE CAN'T CLOSE OURSELVES OFF FROM THOSE
OPPORTUNITIES
MORE THAN HALF OF MANUFACTURING EXECUTIVES HAVE SAID
THEY'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING TO BRING JOBS BACK FROM CHINA
SO LET'S GIVE
THEM ONE MORE REASON TO GET IT DONE
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUSINESSES WILL RELY ON AMERICAN SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
I WANT THE COUNTRY THAT
ELIMINATED POLIO AND MAPPED THE HUMAN GENOME TO LEAD A NEW ERA OF
MEDICINE ONE THAT DELIVERS THE RIGHT TREATMENT AT THE RIGHT TIME
IN SOME PATIENTS WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS THIS APPROACH HAS REVERSED A
DISEASE ONCE THOUGHT UNSTOPPABLE
SO TONIGHT I'M LAUNCHING A NEW
PRECISION MEDICINE INITIATIVE TO BRING US CLOSER TO CURING DISEASES
LIKE CANCER AND DIABETES AND TO GIVE ALL OF US ACCESS TO THE
PERSONALIZED INFORMATION WE NEED TO KEEP OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES
HEALTHIER
WE CAN DO THIS
I INTEND TO PROTECT A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET EXTEND ITS REACH TO EVERY
CLASSROOM AND EVERY COMMUNITY AND HELP FOLKS BUILD THE FASTEST NETWORKS
SO THAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF DIGITAL INNOVATORS AND ENTREPRENEURS
HAVE THE PLATFORM TO KEEP RESHAPING OUR WORLD
I WANT AMERICANS TO WIN
THE RACE FOR THE KINDS OF DISCOVERIES THAT UNLEASH NEW JOBS CONVERTING
SUNLIGHT INTO LIQUID FUEL CREATING REVOLUTIONARY PROSTHETICS SO THAT A
VETERAN WHO GAVE HIS ARMS FOR HIS COUNTRY CAN PLAY CATCH WITH HIS KIDS
AGAIN PUSHING OUT INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM NOT JUST TO VISIT BUT TO STAY
LAST MONTH WE LAUNCHED A NEW SPACECRAFT AS PART OF A REENERGIZED SPACE
PROGRAM THAT WILL SEND AMERICAN ASTRONAUTS TO MARS
AND IN 2 MONTHS TO
PREPARE US FOR THOSE MISSIONS SCOTT KELLY WILL BEGIN A YEAR LONG STAY
IN SPACE
SO GOOD LUCK CAPTAIN
MAKE SURE TO INSTAGRAM IT
WE'RE PROUD
OF YOU
NOW THE TRUTH IS WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE AND
BASIC RESEARCH I KNOW THERE'S BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THIS CHAMBER
MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES HAVE TOLD ME SO
WHERE WE TOO OFTEN RUN ONTO
THE ROCKS IS HOW TO PAY FOR THESE INVESTMENTS
AS AMERICANS WE DON'T
MIND PAYING OUR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES AS LONG AS EVERYBODY ELSE DOES TOO
BUT FOR FAR TOO LONG LOBBYISTS HAVE RIGGED THE TAX CODE WITH LOOPHOLES
THAT LET SOME CORPORATIONS PAY NOTHING WHILE OTHERS PAY FULL FREIGHT
THEY'VE RIDDLED IT WITH GIVEAWAYS THAT THE SUPER RICH DON'T NEED WHILE
DENYING A BREAK TO MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO DO
THIS YEAR WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT
LET'S CLOSE LOOPHOLES
SO WE STOP REWARDING COMPANIES THAT KEEP PROFITS ABROAD AND REWARD
THOSE THAT INVEST HERE IN AMERICA
LET'S USE THOSE SAVINGS TO REBUILD
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR COMPANIES TO
BRING JOBS HOME
LET'S SIMPLIFY THE SYSTEM AND LET A SMALL BUSINESS
OWNER FILE BASED ON HER ACTUAL BANK STATEMENT INSTEAD OF THE NUMBER OF
ACCOUNTANTS SHE CAN AFFORD
AND LET'S CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES THAT LEAD TO
INEQUALITY BY ALLOWING THE TOP 1 PERCENT TO AVOID PAYING TAXES ON THEIR
ACCUMULATED WEALTH
WE CAN USE THAT MONEY TO HELP MORE FAMILIES PAY FOR
CHILDCARE AND SEND THEIR KIDS TO COLLEGE
WE NEED A TAX CODE THAT TRULY
HELPS WORKING AMERICANS TRYING TO GET A LEG UP IN THE NEW ECONOMY AND
WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT TOGETHER
APPLAUSE WE CAN ACHIEVE IT TOGETHER
HELPING HARD WORKING FAMILIES MAKE ENDS MEET GIVING THEM THE TOOLS
THEY NEED FOR GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THIS NEW ECONOMY MAINTAINING THE
CONDITIONS OF GROWTH AND COMPETITIVENESS THIS IS WHERE AMERICA NEEDS TO
GO
I BELIEVE IT'S WHERE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT TO GO
IT WILL MAKE
OUR ECONOMY STRONGER A YEAR FROM NOW 15 YEARS FROM NOW AND DEEP INTO
THE CENTURY AHEAD
OF COURSE IF THERE'S ONE THING THIS NEW CENTURY HAS TAUGHT US IT'S
THAT WE CANNOT SEPARATE OUR WORK HERE AT HOME FROM CHALLENGES BEYOND
OUR SHORES
MY FIRST DUTY AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS TO DEFEND THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA
IN DOING SO THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER AMERICA
LEADS IN THE WORLD BUT HOW
WHEN WE MAKE RASH DECISIONS REACTING TO
THE HEADLINES INSTEAD OF USING OUR HEADS WHEN THE FIRST RESPONSE TO A
CHALLENGE IS TO SEND IN OUR MILITARY THEN WE RISK GETTING DRAWN INTO
UNNECESSARY CONFLICTS AND NEGLECT THE BROADER STRATEGY WE NEED FOR A
SAFER MORE PROSPEROUS WORLD
THAT'S WHAT OUR ENEMIES WANT US TO DO
I BELIEVE IN A SMARTER KIND OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
WE LEAD BEST WHEN
WE COMBINE MILITARY POWER WITH STRONG DIPLOMACY WHEN WE LEVERAGE OUR
POWER WITH COALITION BUILDING WHEN WE DON'T LET OUR FEARS BLIND US TO
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS NEW CENTURY PRESENTS
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
AND AROUND THE GLOBE IT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE
FIRST WE STAND UNITED WITH PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE BEEN
TARGETED BY TERRORISTS FROM A SCHOOL IN PAKISTAN TO THE STREETS OF
PARIS
WE WILL CONTINUE TO HUNT DOWN TERRORISTS AND DISMANTLE THEIR
NETWORKS AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO ACT UNILATERALLY AS WE HAVE DONE
RELENTLESSLY SINCE I TOOK OFFICE TO TAKE OUT TERRORISTS WHO POSE A
DIRECT THREAT TO US AND OUR ALLIES
AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE LEARNED
SOME COSTLY LESSONS OVER THE LAST 13 YEARS
INSTEAD OF AMERICANS
PATROLLING THE VALLEYS OF AFGHANISTAN WE'VE TRAINED THEIR SECURITY
FORCES WHO HAVE NOW TAKEN THE LEAD AND WE'VE HONORED OUR TROOPS'
SACRIFICE BY SUPPORTING THAT COUNTRY'S FIRST DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION
INSTEAD OF SENDING LARGE GROUND FORCES OVERSEAS WE'RE PARTNERING WITH
NATIONS FROM SOUTH ASIA TO NORTH AFRICA TO DENY SAFE HAVEN TO
TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN AMERICA
IN IRAQ AND SYRIA AMERICAN LEADERSHIP INCLUDING OUR MILITARY POWER IS
STOPPING ISIL'S ADVANCE
INSTEAD OF GETTING DRAGGED INTO ANOTHER GROUND
WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE ARE LEADING A BROAD COALITION INCLUDING
ARAB NATIONS TO DEGRADE AND ULTIMATELY DESTROY THIS TERRORIST GROUP
WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING A MODERATE OPPOSITION IN SYRIA THAT CAN HELP US
IN THIS EFFORT AND ASSISTING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE WHO STAND UP TO THE
BANKRUPT IDEOLOGY OF VIOLENT EXTREMISM
NOW THIS EFFORT WILL TAKE TIME
IT WILL REQUIRE FOCUS
BUT WE WILL
SUCCEED
AND TONIGHT I CALL ON THIS CONGRESS TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT WE
ARE UNITED IN THIS MISSION BY PASSING A RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE THE USE
OF FORCE AGAINST ISIL
WE NEED THAT AUTHORITY
SECOND WE'RE DEMONSTRATING THE POWER OF AMERICAN STRENGTH AND
DIPLOMACY
WE'RE UPHOLDING THE PRINCIPLE THAT BIGGER NATIONS CAN'T
BULLY THE SMALL BY OPPOSING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION AND SUPPORTING
UKRAINE'S DEMOCRACY AND REASSURING OUR NATO ALLIES
LAST YEAR AS WE WERE DOING THE HARD WORK OF IMPOSING SANCTIONS ALONG
WITH OUR ALLIES AS WE WERE REINFORCING OUR PRESENCE WITH FRONTLINE
STATES MR
PUTIN'S AGGRESSION IT WAS SUGGESTED WAS A MASTERFUL
DISPLAY OF STRATEGY AND STRENGTH
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD FROM SOME FOLKS
LAUGHTER WELL TODAY IT IS AMERICA THAT STANDS STRONG AND UNITED
WITH OUR ALLIES WHILE RUSSIA IS ISOLATED WITH ITS ECONOMY IN TATTERS
THAT'S HOW AMERICA LEADS NOT WITH BLUSTER BUT WITH PERSISTENT STEADY
RESOLVE
IN CUBA WE ARE ENDING A POLICY THAT WAS LONG PAST ITS EXPIRATION DATE
WHEN WHAT YOU'RE DOING DOESN'T WORK FOR 50 YEARS IT'S TIME TO TRY
SOMETHING NEW
LAUGHTER AND OUR SHIFT IN CUBA POLICY HAS THE
POTENTIAL TO END A LEGACY OF MISTRUST IN OUR HEMISPHERE
IT REMOVES A
PHONY EXCUSE FOR RESTRICTIONS IN CUBA
IT STANDS UP FOR DEMOCRATIC
VALUES AND EXTENDS THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP TO THE CUBAN PEOPLE
AND THIS
YEAR CONGRESS SHOULD BEGIN THE WORK OF ENDING THE EMBARGO
AS HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS HAS SAID DIPLOMACY IS THE WORK OF SMALL
STEPS AND THESE SMALL STEPS HAVE ADDED UP TO NEW HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
IN CUBA
AND AFTER YEARS IN PRISON WE ARE OVERJOYED THAT ALAN GROSS IS
BACK WHERE HE BELONGS
WELCOME HOME ALAN
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE
OUR DIPLOMACY IS AT WORK WITH RESPECT TO IRAN WHERE FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN A DECADE WE'VE HALTED THE PROGRESS OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND
REDUCED ITS STOCKPILE OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL
BETWEEN NOW AND THIS SPRING
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO NEGOTIATE A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT THAT PREVENTS A
NUCLEAR ARMED IRAN SECURES AMERICA AND OUR ALLIES INCLUDING ISRAEL
WHILE AVOIDING YET ANOTHER MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT
THERE ARE NO
GUARANTEES THAT NEGOTIATIONS WILL SUCCEED AND I KEEP ALL OPTIONS ON
THE TABLE TO PREVENT A NUCLEAR IRAN
BUT NEW SANCTIONS PASSED BY THIS CONGRESS AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME WILL
ALL BUT GUARANTEE THAT DIPLOMACY FAILS ALIENATING AMERICA FROM ITS
ALLIES MAKING IT HARDER TO MAINTAIN SANCTIONS AND ENSURING THAT IRAN
STARTS UP ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM AGAIN
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
AND THAT'S
WHY I WILL VETO ANY NEW SANCTIONS BILL THAT THREATENS TO UNDO THIS
PROGRESS
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT US ONLY TO GO TO WAR AS A LAST
RESORT AND I INTEND TO STAY TRUE TO THAT WISDOM
THIRD WE'RE LOOKING
BEYOND THE ISSUES THAT HAVE CONSUMED US IN THE PAST TO SHAPE THE COMING
CENTURY
NO FOREIGN NATION NO HACKER SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHUT DOWN OUR
NETWORKS STEAL OUR TRADE SECRETS OR INVADE THE PRIVACY OF AMERICAN
FAMILIES ESPECIALLY OUR KIDS
SO WE'RE MAKING SURE OUR GOVERNMENT
INTEGRATES INTELLIGENCE TO COMBAT CYBER THREATS JUST AS WE HAVE DONE
TO COMBAT TERRORISM
AND TONIGHT I URGE THIS CONGRESS TO FINALLY PASS THE LEGISLATION WE
NEED TO BETTER MEET THE EVOLVING THREAT OF CYBER ATTACKS COMBAT
IDENTITY THEFT AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN'S INFORMATION
THAT SHOULD BE
A BIPARTISAN EFFORT
IF WE DON'T ACT WE'LL LEAVE OUR NATION AND OUR
ECONOMY VULNERABLE
IF WE DO WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE
TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE UNLEASHED UNTOLD OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE AROUND
THE GLOBE
IN WEST AFRICA OUR TROOPS OUR SCIENTISTS OUR DOCTORS OUR NURSES
OUR HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE ROLLING BACK EBOLA SAVING COUNTLESS LIVES
AND STOPPING THE SPREAD OF DISEASE
I COULD NOT BE PROUDER OF THEM AND
I THANK THIS CONGRESS FOR YOUR BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF THEIR EFFORTS
BUT
THE JOB IS NOT YET DONE AND THE WORLD NEEDS TO USE THIS LESSON TO
BUILD A MORE EFFECTIVE GLOBAL EFFORT TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF FUTURE
PANDEMICS INVEST IN SMART DEVELOPMENT AND ERADICATE EXTREME POVERTY
IN THE ASIA PACIFIC WE ARE MODERNIZING ALLIANCES WHILE MAKING SURE
THAT OTHER NATIONS PLAY BY THE RULES IN HOW THEY TRADE HOW THEY
RESOLVE MARITIME DISPUTES HOW THEY PARTICIPATE IN MEETING COMMON
INTERNATIONAL CHALLENGES LIKE NONPROLIFERATION AND DISASTER RELIEF
AND
NO CHALLENGE NO CHALLENGE POSES A GREATER THREAT TO FUTURE GENERATIONS
THAN CLIMATE CHANGE
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS THE PLANET'S WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD
NOW 1
YEAR DOESN'T MAKE A TREND BUT THIS DOES 14 OF THE 15 WARMEST YEARS ON
RECORD HAVE ALL FALLEN IN THE FIRST 15 YEARS OF THIS CENTURY
NOW I'VE HEARD SOME FOLKS TRY TO DODGE THE EVIDENCE BY SAYING THEY'RE
NOT SCIENTISTS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO ACT
WELL I'M
NOT A SCIENTIST EITHER
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW A LOT OF REALLY GOOD
SCIENTISTS LAUGHTER AT NASA AND AT NOAA AND AT OUR MAJOR UNIVERSITIES
AND THE BEST SCIENTISTS IN THE WORLD ARE ALL TELLING US THAT OUR
ACTIVITIES ARE CHANGING THE CLIMATE AND IF WE DON'T ACT FORCEFULLY
WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE RISING OCEANS LONGER HOTTER HEAT WAVES
DANGEROUS DROUGHTS AND FLOODS AND MASSIVE DISRUPTIONS THAT CAN TRIGGER
GREATER MIGRATION AND CONFLICT AND HUNGER AROUND THE GLOBE
THE
PENTAGON SAYS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE POSES IMMEDIATE RISKS TO OUR NATIONAL
SECURITY
WE SHOULD ACT LIKE IT
AND THAT'S WHY OVER THE PAST 6 YEARS WE'VE DONE MORE THAN EVER TO
COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE FROM THE WAY WE PRODUCE ENERGY TO THE WAY WE USE
IT
THAT'S WHY WE'VE SET ASIDE MORE PUBLIC LANDS AND WATERS THAN ANY
ADMINISTRATION IN HISTORY
AND THAT'S WHY I WILL NOT LET THIS CONGRESS
ENDANGER THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN BY TURNING BACK THE CLOCK ON OUR
EFFORTS
I AM DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICAN LEADERSHIP DRIVES
INTERNATIONAL ACTION
IN BEIJING WE MADE A HISTORIC ANNOUNCEMENT THE UNITED STATES WILL
DOUBLE THE PACE AT WHICH WE CUT CARBON POLLUTION
AND CHINA COMMITTED
FOR THE FIRST TIME TO LIMITING THEIR EMISSIONS
AND BECAUSE THE
WORLD'S TWO LARGEST ECONOMIES CAME TOGETHER OTHER NATIONS ARE NOW
STEPPING UP AND OFFERING HOPE THAT THIS YEAR THE WORLD WILL FINALLY
REACH AN AGREEMENT TO PROTECT THE ONE PLANET WE'VE GOT
AND THERE'S ONE LAST PILLAR OF OUR LEADERSHIP AND THAT'S THE EXAMPLE
OF OUR VALUES
AS AMERICANS WE RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY EVEN WHEN WE'RE
THREATENED WHICH IS WHY I HAVE PROHIBITED TORTURE AND WORKED TO MAKE
SURE OUR USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY LIKE DRONES IS PROPERLY CONSTRAINED
IT'S WHY WE SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE DEPLORABLE ANTI SEMITISM THAT HAS
RESURFACED IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD
IT'S WHY WE CONTINUE TO
REJECT OFFENSIVE STEREOTYPES OF MUSLIMS THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHOM
SHARE OUR COMMITMENT TO PEACE
THAT'S WHY WE DEFEND FREE SPEECH AND
ADVOCATE FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS AND CONDEMN THE PERSECUTION OF WOMEN
OR RELIGIOUS MINORITIES OR PEOPLE WHO ARE LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL OR
TRANSGENDER
WE DO THESE THINGS NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE RIGHT
THING TO DO BUT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THEY WILL MAKE US SAFER
AS AMERICANS WE HAVE A PROFOUND COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE
SO IT MAKES NO
SENSE TO SPEND 3 MILLION PER PRISONER TO KEEP OPEN A PRISON THAT THE
WORLD CONDEMNS AND TERRORISTS USE TO RECRUIT
SINCE I'VE BEEN PRESIDENT
WE'VE WORKED RESPONSIBLY TO CUT THE POPULATION OF GITMO IN HALF
NOW IT
IS TIME TO FINISH THE JOB
AND I WILL NOT RELENT IN MY DETERMINATION TO
SHUT IT DOWN
IT IS NOT WHO WE ARE
IT'S TIME TO CLOSE GITMO
AS AMERICANS WE CHERISH OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES AND WE NEED TO UPHOLD
THAT COMMITMENT IF WE WANT MAXIMUM COOPERATION FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND
INDUSTRY IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST TERRORIST NETWORKS
SO WHILE SOME HAVE
MOVED ON FROM THE DEBATES OVER OUR SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS I HAVE NOT
AS PROMISED OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES HAVE WORKED HARD WITH THE
RECOMMENDATIONS OF PRIVACY ADVOCATES TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND
BUILD MORE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST POTENTIAL ABUSE
AND NEXT MONTH WE'LL
ISSUE A REPORT ON HOW WE'RE KEEPING OUR PROMISE TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY
SAFE WHILE STRENGTHENING PRIVACY
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE INSTEAD OF THE PAST MAKING SURE WE MATCH OUR
POWER WITH DIPLOMACY AND USE FORCE WISELY BUILDING COALITIONS TO MEET
NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES LEADING ALWAYS WITH THE EXAMPLE OF
OUR VALUES THAT'S WHAT MAKES US EXCEPTIONAL
THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US
STRONG
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO KEEP STRIVING TO HOLD OURSELVES TO THE
HIGHEST OF STANDARDS OUR OWN
YOU KNOW JUST OVER A DECADE AGO I GAVE A SPEECH IN BOSTON WHERE I
SAID THERE WASN'T A LIBERAL AMERICA OR A CONSERVATIVE AMERICA A BLACK
AMERICA OR A WHITE AMERICA BUT A UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
I SAID THIS
BECAUSE I HAD SEEN IT IN MY OWN LIFE IN A NATION THAT GAVE SOMEONE
LIKE ME A CHANCE BECAUSE I GREW UP IN HAWAII A MELTING POT OF RACES
AND CUSTOMS BECAUSE I MADE ILLINOIS MY HOME A STATE OF SMALL TOWNS
RICH FARMLAND ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT CITIES A MICROCOSM OF THE
COUNTRY WHERE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS GOOD PEOPLE
OF EVERY ETHNICITY AND EVERY FAITH SHARE CERTAIN BEDROCK VALUES
OVER THE PAST 6 YEARS THE PUNDITS HAVE POINTED OUT MORE THAN ONCE THAT
MY PRESIDENCY HASN'T DELIVERED ON THIS VISION
HOW IRONIC THEY SAY
THAT OUR POLITICS SEEMS MORE DIVIDED THAN EVER
IT'S HELD UP AS PROOF
NOT JUST OF MY OWN FLAWS OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY BUT ALSO AS PROOF THAT
THE VISION ITSELF IS MISGUIDED NAIVE THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN WHO ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM PARTISANSHIP AND GRIDLOCK FOR US
TO EVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
I KNOW HOW TEMPTING SUCH CYNICISM MAY BE
BUT I STILL THINK THE CYNICS
ARE WRONG
I STILL BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ONE PEOPLE
I STILL BELIEVE THAT
TOGETHER WE CAN DO GREAT THINGS EVEN WHEN THE ODDS ARE LONG
I BELIEVE THIS BECAUSE OVER AND OVER IN MY 6 YEARS IN OFFICE I HAVE
SEEN AMERICA AT ITS BEST
I'VE SEEN THE HOPEFUL FACES OF YOUNG
GRADUATES FROM NEW YORK TO CALIFORNIA AND OUR NEWEST OFFICERS AT WEST
POINT ANNAPOLIS COLORADO SPRINGS NEW LONDON
I'VE MOURNED WITH
GRIEVING FAMILIES IN TUCSON AND NEWTOWN IN BOSTON IN WEST TEXAS AND
WEST VIRGINIA
I'VE WATCHED AMERICANS BEAT BACK ADVERSITY FROM THE GULF
COAST TO THE GREAT PLAINS FROM MIDWEST ASSEMBLY LINES TO THE MID
ATLANTIC SEABOARD
I'VE SEEN SOMETHING LIKE GAY MARRIAGE GO FROM A
WEDGE ISSUE USED TO DRIVE US APART TO A STORY OF FREEDOM ACROSS OUR
COUNTRY A CIVIL RIGHT NOW LEGAL IN STATES THAT 7 IN 10 AMERICANS CALL
HOME
SO I KNOW THE GOOD AND OPTIMISTIC AND BIG HEARTED GENEROSITY OF
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO EVERY DAY LIVE THE IDEA THAT WE ARE OUR
BROTHER'S KEEPER AND OUR SISTER'S KEEPER
AND I KNOW THEY EXPECT THOSE
OF US WHO SERVE HERE TO SET A BETTER EXAMPLE
SO THE QUESTION FOR THOSE OF US HERE TONIGHT IS HOW WE ALL OF US CAN
BETTER REFLECT AMERICA'S HOPES
I'VE SERVED IN CONGRESS WITH MANY OF
YOU
I KNOW MANY OF YOU WELL
THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE HERE ON
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE
AND MANY OF YOU HAVE TOLD ME THAT THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR ARGUING PAST EACH OTHER ON CABLE SHOWS THE
CONSTANT FUNDRAISING ALWAYS LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER AT HOW THE BASE
WILL REACT TO EVERY DECISION
IMAGINE IF WE BROKE OUT OF THESE TIRED OLD PATTERNS
IMAGINE IF WE DID
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
UNDERSTAND A BETTER POLITICS ISN'T ONE WHERE
DEMOCRATS ABANDON THEIR AGENDA OR REPUBLICANS SIMPLY EMBRACE MINE
A
BETTER POLITICS IS ONE WHERE WE APPEAL TO EACH OTHER'S BASIC DECENCY
INSTEAD OF OUR BASEST FEARS
A BETTER POLITICS IS ONE WHERE WE DEBATE
WITHOUT DEMONIZING EACH OTHER WHERE WE TALK ISSUES AND VALUES AND
PRINCIPLES AND FACTS RATHER THAN GOTCHA MOMENTS OR TRIVIAL GAFFES OR
FAKE CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES
A POLITICS A BETTER POLITICS IS ONE WHERE WE SPEND LESS TIME DROWNING
IN DARK MONEY FOR ADS THAT PULL US INTO THE GUTTER AND SPEND MORE TIME
LIFTING YOUNG PEOPLE UP WITH A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND POSSIBILITY ASKING
THEM TO JOIN IN THE GREAT MISSION OF BUILDING AMERICA
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ARGUMENTS LET'S HAVE ARGUMENTS BUT LET'S MAKE
THEM DEBATES WORTHY OF THIS BODY AND WORTHY OF THIS COUNTRY
WE STILL
MAY NOT AGREE ON A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE BUT SURELY WE CAN AGREE
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT TEEN PREGNANCIES AND ABORTIONS ARE NEARING
ALLTIME LOWS AND THAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE
THAT SHE NEEDS
YES PASSIONS STILL FLY ON IMMIGRATION BUT SURELY WE CAN ALL SEE
SOMETHING OF OURSELVES IN THE STRIVING YOUNG STUDENT AND AGREE THAT NO
ONE BENEFITS WHEN A HARD WORKING MOM IS SNATCHED FROM HER CHILD AND
THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO SHAPE A LAW THAT UPHOLDS OUR TRADITION AS A
NATION OF LAWS AND A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS
I'VE TALKED TO REPUBLICANS
AND DEMOCRATS ABOUT THAT
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SHARE
WE MAY GO AT IT IN CAMPAIGN SEASON BUT SURELY WE CAN AGREE THAT THE
RIGHT TO VOTE IS SACRED THAT IT'S BEING DENIED TO TOO MANY AND THAT
ON THIS 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GREAT MARCH FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY
AND THE PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WE CAN COME TOGETHER
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO MAKE VOTING EASIER FOR EVERY SINGLE
AMERICAN
WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT TAKES ON THE EVENTS OF FERGUSON AND NEW YORK
BUT
SURELY WE CAN UNDERSTAND A FATHER WHO FEARS HIS SON CAN'T WALK HOME
WITHOUT BEING HARASSED
AND SURELY WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE WIFE WHO WON'T
REST UNTIL THE POLICE OFFICER SHE MARRIED WALKS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR
AT THE END OF HIS SHIFT
AND SURELY WE CAN AGREE THAT IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS THE CRIME RATE AND THE
INCARCERATION RATE HAVE COME DOWN TOGETHER AND USE THAT AS A STARTING
POINT FOR DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS COMMUNITY LEADERS AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT TO REFORM AMERICA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THAT IT
PROTECTS AND SERVES ALL OF US
THAT'S A BETTER POLITICS
THAT'S HOW WE START REBUILDING TRUST
THAT'S
HOW WE MOVE THIS COUNTRY FORWARD
THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT
AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DESERVE
I HAVE NO MORE CAMPAIGNS TO RUN
AT THIS POINT SOME AUDIENCE MEMBERS APPLAUDED
MY ONLY AGENDA LAUGHTER
AUDIENCE MEMBER
INAUDIBLE
THE PRESIDENT
I KNOW BECAUSE I WON BOTH OF THEM
LAUGHTER MY ONLY
AGENDA FOR THE NEXT 2 YEARS IS THE SAME AS THE ONE I'VE HAD SINCE THE
DAY I SWORE AN OATH ON THE STEPS OF THIS CAPITOL TO DO WHAT I BELIEVE
IS BEST FOR AMERICA
IF YOU SHARE THE BROAD VISION I OUTLINED TONIGHT
I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN THE WORK AT HAND
IF YOU DISAGREE WITH PARTS OF
IT I HOPE YOU'LL AT LEAST WORK WITH ME WHERE YOU DO AGREE
AND I
COMMIT TO EVERY REPUBLICAN HERE TONIGHT THAT I WILL NOT ONLY SEEK OUT
YOUR IDEAS I WILL SEEK TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY STRONGER
BECAUSE I WANT THIS CHAMBER I WANT THIS CITY TO REFLECT THE TRUTH
THAT FOR ALL OUR BLIND SPOTS AND SHORTCOMINGS WE ARE A PEOPLE WITH THE
STRENGTH AND GENEROSITY OF SPIRIT TO BRIDGE DIVIDES TO UNITE IN COMMON
EFFORT TO HELP OUR NEIGHBORS WHETHER DOWN THE STREET OR ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE WORLD
I WANT OUR ACTIONS TO TELL EVERY CHILD IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD YOUR LIFE
MATTERS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING YOUR LIFE CHANCES AS
COMMITTED AS WE ARE TO WORKING ON BEHALF OF OUR OWN KIDS
I WANT FUTURE
GENERATIONS TO KNOW THAT WE ARE A PEOPLE WHO SEE OUR DIFFERENCES AS A
GREAT GIFT THAT WE'RE A PEOPLE WHO VALUE THE DIGNITY AND WORTH OF
EVERY CITIZEN MAN AND WOMAN YOUNG AND OLD BLACK AND WHITE LATINO
ASIAN IMMIGRANT NATIVE AMERICAN GAY STRAIGHT AMERICANS WITH MENTAL
ILLNESS OR PHYSICAL DISABILITY
EVERYBODY MATTERS
I WANT THEM TO GROW
UP IN A COUNTRY THAT SHOWS THE WORLD WHAT WE STILL KNOW TO BE TRUE
THAT WE ARE STILL MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF RED STATES AND BLUE STATES
THAT WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
I WANT THEM TO GROW UP IN A COUNTRY WHERE A YOUNG MOM CAN SIT DOWN AND
WRITE A LETTER TO HER PRESIDENT WITH A STORY THAT SUMS UP THESE PAST 6
YEARS IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN BOUNCE BACK FROM WHEN YOU HAVE
TO
WE ARE A STRONG TIGHT KNIT FAMILY WHO'S MADE IT THROUGH SOME
VERY VERY HARD TIMES
MY FELLOW AMERICANS WE TOO ARE A STRONG TIGHT KNIT FAMILY
WE TOO
HAVE MADE IT THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES
FIFTEEN YEARS INTO THIS NEW
CENTURY WE HAVE PICKED OURSELVES UP DUSTED OURSELVES OFF AND BEGUN
AGAIN THE WORK OF REMAKING AMERICA
WE HAVE LAID A NEW FOUNDATION
A
BRIGHTER FUTURE IS OURS TO WRITE
LET'S BEGIN THIS NEW CHAPTER TOGETHER
AND LET'S START THE WORK RIGHT NOW
THANK YOU
GOD BLESS YOU
GOD BLESS THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE
THANK YOU
ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE CONGRESS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
BARACK OBAMA
JANUARY 12 2016
THANK YOU
MR
SPEAKER MR
VICE PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MY
FELLOW AMERICANS TONIGHT MARKS THE EIGHTH YEAR THAT I'VE COME HERE TO
REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION
AND FOR THIS FINAL ONE I'M GOING TO
TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE SHORTER
I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE ANTSY TO GET
BACK TO IOWA
LAUGHTER I'VE BEEN THERE
I'LL BE SHAKING HANDS
AFTERWARDS IF YOU WANT SOME TIPS
LAUGHTER
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE IT'S AN ELECTION SEASON EXPECTATIONS
FOR WHAT WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS YEAR ARE LOW
BUT MR
SPEAKER I
APPRECIATE THE CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH THAT YOU AND OTHER LEADERS TOOK AT
THE END OF LAST YEAR TO PASS A BUDGET AND MAKE TAX CUTS PERMANENT FOR
WORKING FAMILIES
SO I HOPE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER THIS YEAR ON SOME
BIPARTISAN PRIORITIES LIKE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND HELPING PEOPLE
WHO ARE BATTLING PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE AND HEROIN ABUSE
SO WHO
KNOWS WE MIGHT SURPRISE THE CYNICS AGAIN
BUT TONIGHT I WANT TO GO EASY ON THE TRADITIONAL LIST OF PROPOSALS FOR
THE YEAR AHEAD
DON'T WORRY I'VE GOT PLENTY LAUGHTER FROM HELPING
STUDENTS LEARN TO WRITE COMPUTER CODE TO PERSONALIZING MEDICAL
TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS
AND I WILL KEEP PUSHING FOR PROGRESS ON THE
WORK THAT I BELIEVE STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE FIXING A BROKEN IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM PROTECTING OUR KIDS FROM GUN VIOLENCE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
PAID LEAVE RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE
ALL THESE THINGS STILL MATTER TO
HARD WORKING FAMILIES
THEY'RE STILL THE RIGHT THING TO DO
AND I WON'T
LET UP UNTIL THEY GET DONE
BUT FOR MY FINAL ADDRESS TO THIS CHAMBER I DON'T WANT TO JUST TALK
ABOUT NEXT YEAR
I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE NEXT 5 YEARS THE NEXT 10 YEARS
AND BEYOND
I WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR FUTURE
WE LIVE IN A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE CHANGE THAT'S RESHAPING THE
WAY WE LIVE THE WAY WE WORK OUR PLANET OUR PLACE IN THE WORLD
IT'S
CHANGE THAT PROMISES AMAZING MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGHS BUT ALSO ECONOMIC
DISRUPTIONS THAT STRAIN WORKING FAMILIES
IT PROMISES THIS EDUCATION
FOR GIRLS IN THE MOST REMOTE VILLAGES BUT ALSO CONNECTS TERRORISTS
PLOTTING AN OCEAN AWAY
IT'S CHANGE THAT CAN BROADEN OPPORTUNITY OR
WIDEN INEQUALITY
AND WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT THE PACE OF THIS
CHANGE WILL ONLY ACCELERATE
AMERICA HAS BEEN THROUGH BIG CHANGES BEFORE WARS AND DEPRESSION THE
INFLUX OF NEW IMMIGRANTS WORKERS FIGHTING FOR A FAIR DEAL MOVEMENTS
TO EXPAND CIVIL RIGHTS
EACH TIME THERE HAVE BEEN THOSE WHO TOLD US TO
FEAR THE FUTURE WHO CLAIMED WE COULD SLAM THE BRAKES ON CHANGE WHO
PROMISED TO RESTORE PAST GLORY IF WE JUST GOT SOME GROUP OR IDEA THAT
WAS THREATENING AMERICA UNDER CONTROL
AND EACH TIME WE OVERCAME THOSE
FEARS
WE DID NOT IN THE WORDS OF LINCOLN ADHERE TO THE DOGMAS OF
THE QUIET PAST INSTEAD WE THOUGHT ANEW AND ACTED ANEW
WE MADE
CHANGE WORK FOR US ALWAYS EXTENDING AMERICA'S PROMISE OUTWARD TO THE
NEXT FRONTIER TO MORE PEOPLE
AND BECAUSE WE DID BECAUSE WE SAW
OPPORTUNITY WITH A WHERE OTHERS SAW PERIL WE EMERGED STRONGER AND
BETTER THAN BEFORE
WHAT WAS TRUE THEN CAN BE TRUE NOW
OUR UNIQUE STRENGTHS AS A NATION
OUR OPTIMISM AND WORK ETHIC OUR SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY OUR DIVERSITY
OUR COMMITMENT TO RULE OF LAW THESE THINGS GIVE US EVERYTHING WE NEED
TO ENSURE PROSPERITY AND SECURITY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME
IN FACT IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT THAT WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS THESE PAST 7
YEARS
THAT'S HOW WE RECOVERED FROM THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS IN
GENERATIONS
THAT'S HOW WE REFORMED OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND
REINVENTED OUR ENERGY SECTOR
THAT'S HOW WE DELIVERED MORE CARE AND
BENEFITS TO OUR TROOPS COMING HOME AND OUR VETERANS
THAT'S HOW WE
SECURED THE FREEDOM IN EVERY STATE TO MARRY THE PERSON WE LOVE
BUT SUCH PROGRESS IS NOT INEVITABLE
IT'S THE RESULT OF CHOICES WE MAKE
TOGETHER
AND WE FACE SUCH CHOICES RIGHT NOW
WILL WE RESPOND TO THE
CHANGES OF OUR TIME WITH FEAR TURNING INWARD AS A NATION TURNING
AGAINST EACH OTHER AS A PEOPLE OR WILL WE FACE THE FUTURE WITH
CONFIDENCE IN WHO WE ARE IN WHAT WE STAND FOR IN THE INCREDIBLE
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE AND FOUR BIG QUESTIONS THAT I BELIEVE WE
AS A COUNTRY HAVE TO ANSWER REGARDLESS OF WHO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS OR
WHO CONTROLS THE NEXT CONGRESS
FIRST HOW DO WE GIVE EVERYONE A FAIR
SHOT AT OPPORTUNITY AND SECURITY IN THIS NEW ECONOMY SECOND HOW DO WE
MAKE TECHNOLOGY WORK FOR US AND NOT AGAINST US ESPECIALLY WHEN IT
COMES TO SOLVING URGENT CHALLENGES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE THIRD HOW DO
WE KEEP AMERICA SAFE AND LEAD THE WORLD WITHOUT BECOMING ITS POLICEMAN
AND FINALLY HOW CAN WE MAKE OUR POLITICS REFLECT WHAT'S BEST IN US AND
NOT WHAT'S WORST
LET ME START WITH THE ECONOMY AND A BASIC FACT THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA RIGHT NOW HAS THE STRONGEST MOST DURABLE ECONOMY IN THE WORLD
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LONGEST STREAK OF PRIVATE SECTOR JOB
CREATION IN HISTORY
MORE THAN 14 MILLION NEW JOBS THE STRONGEST 2
YEARS OF JOB GROWTH SINCE THE 1990S AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CUT IN HALF
OUR AUTO INDUSTRY JUST HAD ITS BEST YEAR EVER
THAT'S JUST PART OF A
MANUFACTURING SURGE THAT'S CREATED NEARLY 900 000 NEW JOBS IN THE PAST
6 YEARS
AND WE'VE DONE ALL THIS WHILE CUTTING OUR DEFICITS BY ALMOST
THREE QUARTERS
ANYONE CLAIMING THAT AMERICA'S ECONOMY IS IN DECLINE IS PEDDLING
FICTION
NOW WHAT IS TRUE AND THE REASON THAT A LOT OF AMERICANS FEEL
ANXIOUS IS THAT THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN CHANGING IN PROFOUND WAYS CHANGES
THAT STARTED LONG BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION HIT CHANGES THAT HAVE NOT
LET UP
TODAY TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T JUST REPLACE JOBS ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE BUT
ANY JOB WHERE WORK CAN BE AUTOMATED
COMPANIES IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY CAN
LOCATE ANYWHERE AND THEY FACE TOUGHER COMPETITION
AS A RESULT
WORKERS HAVE LESS LEVERAGE FOR A RAISE
COMPANIES HAVE LESS LOYALTY TO
THEIR COMMUNITIES
AND MORE AND MORE WEALTH AND INCOME IS CONCENTRATED
AT THE VERY TOP
ALL THESE TRENDS HAVE SQUEEZED WORKERS EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE JOBS EVEN
WHEN THE ECONOMY IS GROWING
IT'S MADE IT HARDER FOR A HARD WORKING
FAMILY TO PULL ITSELF OUT OF POVERTY HARDER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO START
THEIR CAREERS TOUGHER FOR WORKERS TO RETIRE WHEN THEY WANT TO
AND
ALTHOUGH NONE OF THESE TRENDS ARE UNIQUE TO AMERICA THEY DO OFFEND OUR
UNIQUELY AMERICAN BELIEF THAT EVERYBODY WHO WORKS HARD SHOULD GET A
FAIR SHOT
FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS OUR GOAL HAS BEEN A GROWING ECONOMY THAT ALSO
WORKS BETTER FOR EVERYBODY
WE'VE MADE PROGRESS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE
MORE
AND DESPITE ALL THE POLITICAL ARGUMENTS THAT WE'VE HAD THESE PAST
FEW YEARS THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME AREAS WHERE AMERICANS BROADLY AGREE
WE AGREE THAT REAL OPPORTUNITY REQUIRES EVERY AMERICAN TO GET THE
EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO LAND A GOOD PAYING JOB
THE
BIPARTISAN REFORM OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WAS AN IMPORTANT START AND
TOGETHER WE'VE INCREASED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION LIFTED HIGH SCHOOL
GRADUATION RATES TO NEW HIGHS BOOSTED GRADUATES IN FIELDS LIKE
ENGINEERING
IN THE COMING YEARS WE SHOULD BUILD ON THAT PROGRESS BY
PROVIDING PRE K FOR ALL AND OFFERING EVERY STUDENT THE HANDS ON
COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MATH CLASSES THAT MAKE THEM JOB READY ON DAY ONE
WE SHOULD RECRUIT AND SUPPORT MORE GREAT TEACHERS FOR OUR KIDS
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR EVERY AMERICAN
NO HARD
WORKING STUDENT SHOULD BE STUCK IN THE RED
WE'VE ALREADY REDUCED
STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS BY TO 10 PERCENT OF A BORROWER'S INCOME
AND
THAT'S GOOD
BUT NOW WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO CUT THE COST OF COLLEGE
PROVIDING 2 YEARS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT NO COST FOR EVERY RESPONSIBLE
STUDENT IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT AND I'M GOING TO KEEP
FIGHTING TO GET THAT STARTED THIS YEAR
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
BUT A GREAT EDUCATION ISN'T ALL WE NEED IN THIS NEW ECONOMY
WE ALSO
NEED BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS THAT PROVIDE A BASIC MEASURE OF SECURITY
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH OF A STRETCH TO SAY THAT SOME OF THE ONLY PEOPLE IN
AMERICA WHO ARE GOING TO WORK THE SAME JOB IN THE SAME PLACE WITH A
HEALTH AND RETIREMENT PACKAGE FOR 30 YEARS ARE SITTING IN THIS CHAMBER
LAUGHTER FOR EVERYONE ELSE ESPECIALLY FOLKS IN THEIR FORTIES AND
FIFTIES SAVING FOR RETIREMENT OR BOUNCING BACK FROM JOB LOSS HAS
GOTTEN A LOT TOUGHER
AMERICANS UNDERSTAND THAT AT SOME POINT IN THEIR
CAREERS IN THIS NEW ECONOMY THEY MAY HAVE TO RETOOL THEY MAY HAVE TO
RETRAIN
BUT THEY SHOULDN'T LOSE WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY WORKED SO HARD TO
BUILD IN THE PROCESS
THAT'S WHY SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER
WE SHOULDN'T WEAKEN THEM WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN THEM
AND FOR AMERICANS
SHORT OF RETIREMENT BASIC BENEFITS SHOULD BE JUST AS MOBILE AS
EVERYTHING ELSE IS TODAY
THAT BY THE WAY IS WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT IS ALL ABOUT
IT'S ABOUT FILLING THE GAPS IN EMPLOYER BASED CARE SO
THAT WHEN YOU LOSE A JOB OR YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL OR YOU STRIKE OUT AND
LAUNCH THAT NEW BUSINESS YOU'LL STILL HAVE COVERAGE
NEARLY 18 MILLION
PEOPLE HAVE GAINED COVERAGE SO FAR
AND IN THE PROCESS HEALTH CARE
INFLATION HAS SLOWED
AND OUR BUSINESSES HAVE CREATED JOBS EVERY SINGLE
MONTH SINCE IT BECAME LAW
NOW I'M GUESSING WE WON'T AGREE ON HEALTH CARE ANYTIME SOON BUT
LAUGHTER A LITTLE APPLAUSE BACK THERE
LAUGHTER JUST A GUESS
BUT
THERE SHOULD BE OTHER WAYS PARTIES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE
ECONOMIC SECURITY
SAY A HARD WORKING AMERICAN LOSES HIS JOB
WE
SHOULDN'T JUST MAKE SURE THAT HE CAN GET UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WE
SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT PROGRAM ENCOURAGES HIM TO RETRAIN FOR A BUSINESS
THAT'S READY TO HIRE HIM
IF THAT NEW JOB DOESN'T PAY AS MUCH THERE
SHOULD BE A SYSTEM OF WAGE INSURANCE IN PLACE SO THAT HE CAN STILL PAY
HIS BILLS
AND EVEN IF HE'S GOING FROM JOB TO JOB HE SHOULD STILL BE
ABLE TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT AND TAKE HIS SAVINGS WITH HIM
THAT'S THE
WAY WE MAKE THE NEW ECONOMY WORK BETTER FOR EVERYBODY
I ALSO KNOW SPEAKER RYAN HAS TALKED ABOUT HIS INTEREST IN TACKLING
POVERTY
AMERICA IS ABOUT GIVING EVERYBODY WILLING TO WORK A CHANCE A
HAND UP
AND I'D WELCOME A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT STRATEGIES WE CAN
ALL SUPPORT LIKE EXPANDING TAX CUTS FOR LOW INCOME WORKERS WHO DON'T
HAVE CHILDREN
BUT THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE WE JUST HAVE TO BE HONEST IT HAS BEEN
DIFFICULT TO FIND AGREEMENT OVER THE LAST 7 YEARS
AND A LOT OF THEM
FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF WHAT ROLE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD PLAY IN
MAKING SURE THE SYSTEM'S NOT RIGGED IN FAVOR OF THE WEALTHIEST AND
BIGGEST CORPORATIONS
AND IT'S AN HONEST DISAGREEMENT AND THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE
I BELIEVE A THRIVING PRIVATE SECTOR IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY
I
THINK THERE ARE OUTDATED REGULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED
THERE IS
REDTAPE THAT NEEDS TO BE CUT
APPLAUSE THERE YOU GO YES SEE BUT
AFTER YEARS NOW OF RECORD CORPORATE PROFITS WORKING FAMILIES WON'T GET
MORE OPPORTUNITY OR BIGGER PAYCHECKS JUST BY LETTING BIG BANKS OR BIG
OIL OR HEDGE FUNDS MAKE THEIR OWN RULES AT EVERYBODY ELSE'S EXPENSE
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES ARE NOT GOING TO FEEL MORE SECURE BECAUSE WE
ALLOWED ATTACKS ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO GO UNANSWERED
FOOD STAMP
RECIPIENTS DID NOT CAUSE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS RECKLESSNESS ON WALL
STREET DID
IMMIGRANTS AREN'T THE PRINCIPAL REASON WAGES HAVEN'T GONE
UP THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE IN THE BOARDROOMS THAT ALL TOO OFTEN PUT
QUARTERLY EARNINGS OVER LONG TERM RETURNS
IT'S SURE NOT THE AVERAGE
FAMILY WATCHING TONIGHT THAT AVOIDS PAYING TAXES THROUGH OFFSHORE
ACCOUNTS
LAUGHTER
THE POINT IS I BELIEVE THAT IN THIS NEW ECONOMY WORKERS AND STARTUPS
AND SMALL BUSINESSES NEED MORE OF A VOICE NOT LESS
THE RULES SHOULD
WORK FOR THEM
AND I'M NOT ALONE IN THIS
THIS YEAR I PLAN TO LIFT UP
THE MANY BUSINESSES WHO HAVE FIGURED OUT THAT DOING RIGHT BY THEIR
WORKERS OR THEIR CUSTOMERS OR THEIR COMMUNITIES ENDS UP BEING GOOD FOR
THEIR SHAREHOLDERS
AND I WANT TO SPREAD THOSE BEST PRACTICES ACROSS
AMERICA
THAT'S PART OF A BRIGHTER FUTURE
IN FACT IT TURNS OUT MANY OF OUR BEST CORPORATE CITIZENS ARE ALSO OUR
MOST CREATIVE
AND THIS BRINGS ME TO THE SECOND BIG QUESTION WE AS A
COUNTRY HAVE TO ANSWER HOW DO WE REIGNITE THAT SPIRIT OF INNOVATION TO
MEET OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES
SIXTY YEARS AGO WHEN THE RUSSIANS BEAT US INTO SPACE WE DIDN'T DENY
SPUTNIK WAS UP THERE
LAUGHTER WE DIDN'T ARGUE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OR
SHRINK OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUDGET
WE BUILT A SPACE PROGRAM
ALMOST OVERNIGHT
AND 12 YEARS LATER WE WERE WALKING ON THE MOON
NOW THAT SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY IS IN OUR DNA
AMERICA IS THOMAS EDISON
AND THE WRIGHT BROTHERS AND GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER
AMERICA IS GRACE
HOPPER AND KATHERINE JOHNSON AND SALLY RIDE
AMERICA IS EVERY IMMIGRANT
AND ENTREPRENEUR FROM BOSTON TO AUSTIN TO SILICON VALLEY RACING TO
SHAPE A BETTER FUTURE
THAT'S WHO WE ARE
AND OVER THE PAST 7 YEARS WE'VE NURTURED THAT SPIRIT
WE'VE PROTECTED
AN OPEN INTERNET AND TAKEN BOLD NEW STEPS TO GET MORE STUDENTS AND LOW
INCOME AMERICANS ONLINE
WE'VE LAUNCHED NEXT GENERATION MANUFACTURING
HUBS AND ONLINE TOOLS THAT GIVE AN ENTREPRENEUR EVERYTHING HE OR SHE
NEEDS TO START A BUSINESS IN A SINGLE DAY
BUT WE CAN DO SO MUCH MORE
LAST YEAR VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID THAT WITH A NEW MOONSHOT AMERICA
CAN CURE CANCER
LAST MONTH HE WORKED WITH THIS CONGRESS TO GIVE
SCIENTISTS AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH THE STRONGEST RESOURCES
THAT THEY'VE HAD IN OVER A DECADE
WELL SO TONIGHT I'M ANNOUNCING A NEW
NATIONAL EFFORT TO GET IT DONE
AND BECAUSE HE'S GONE TO THE MAT FOR
ALL OF US ON SO MANY ISSUES OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS I'M PUTTING JOE IN
CHARGE OF MISSION CONTROL
FOR THE LOVED ONES WE'VE ALL LOST FOR THE
FAMILIES THAT WE CAN STILL SAVE LET'S MAKE AMERICA THE COUNTRY THAT
CURES CANCER ONCE AND FOR ALL
WHAT DO YOU SAY JOE LET'S MAKE IT
HAPPEN
NOW MEDICAL RESEARCH IS CRITICAL
WE NEED THE SAME LEVEL OF COMMITMENT
WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPING CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES
LOOK IF ANYBODY
STILL WANTS TO DISPUTE THE SCIENCE AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE AT IT
LAUGHTER YOU WILL BE PRETTY LONELY BECAUSE YOU'LL BE DEBATING OUR
MILITARY MOST OF AMERICA'S BUSINESS LEADERS THE MAJORITY OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND 200
NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD WHO AGREE IT'S A PROBLEM AND INTEND TO SOLVE
IT
BUT EVEN IF THE PLANET WASN'T AT STAKE EVEN IF 2014 WASN'T THE
WARMEST YEAR ON RECORD UNTIL 2015 TURNED OUT TO BE EVEN HOTTER WHY
WOULD WE WANT TO PASS UP THE CHANCE FOR AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO PRODUCE
AND SELL THE ENERGY OF THE FUTURE LISTEN 7 YEARS AGO WE MADE THE
SINGLE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY IN OUR HISTORY
HERE ARE THE
RESULTS
IN FIELDS FROM IOWA TO TEXAS WIND POWER IS NOW CHEAPER THAN
DIRTIER CONVENTIONAL POWER
ON ROOFTOPS FROM ARIZONA TO NEW YORK
SOLAR IS SAVING AMERICANS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR ON THEIR
ENERGY BILLS AND EMPLOYS MORE AMERICANS THAN COAL IN JOBS THAT PAY
BETTER THAN AVERAGE
WE'RE TAKING STEPS TO GIVE HOMEOWNERS THE FREEDOM
TO GENERATE AND STORE THEIR OWN ENERGY SOMETHING BY THE WAY THAT
ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND TEA PARTIERS HAVE TEAMED UP TO SUPPORT
AND
MEANWHILE WE'VE CUT OUR IMPORTS OF FOREIGN OIL BY NEARLY 60 PERCENT
AND CUT CARBON POLLUTION MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY ON EARTH
GAS
UNDER 2 BUCKS A GALLON AIN'T BAD EITHER
LAUGHTER
NOW WE'VE GOT TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM OLD DIRTIER
ENERGY SOURCES
RATHER THAN SUBSIDIZE THE PAST WE SHOULD INVEST IN THE
FUTURE ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON FOSSIL FUELS
WE DO THEM
NO FAVOR WHEN WE DON'T SHOW THEM WHERE THE TRENDS ARE GOING
AND THAT'S
WHY I'M GOING TO PUSH TO CHANGE THE WAY WE MANAGE OUR OIL AND COAL
RESOURCES SO THAT THEY BETTER REFLECT THE COSTS THEY IMPOSE ON
TAXPAYERS AND OUR PLANET
AND THAT WAY WE PUT MONEY BACK INTO THOSE
COMMUNITIES AND PUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS TO WORK BUILDING A
21ST CENTURY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
NOW NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT
AND YES THERE ARE
PLENTY OF ENTRENCHED INTERESTS WHO WANT TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO
BUT
THE JOBS WE'LL CREATE THE MONEY WE'LL SAVE THE PLANET WE'LL PRESERVE
THAT IS THE KIND OF FUTURE OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS DESERVE
AND IT'S
WITHIN OUR GRASP
NOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS JUST ONE OF MANY ISSUES WHERE OUR SECURITY IS
LINKED TO THE REST OF THE WORLD
AND THAT'S WHY THE THIRD BIG QUESTION
THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER TOGETHER IS HOW TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE AND STRONG
WITHOUT EITHER ISOLATING OURSELVES OR TRYING TO NATION BUILD EVERYWHERE
THERE'S A PROBLEM
NOW I TOLD YOU EARLIER ALL THE TALK OF AMERICA'S ECONOMIC DECLINE IS
POLITICAL HOT AIR
WELL SO IS ALL THE RHETORIC YOU HEAR ABOUT OUR
ENEMIES GETTING STRONGER AND AMERICA GETTING WEAKER
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS THE MOST POWERFUL NATION ON
EARTH
PERIOD
APPLAUSE PERIOD
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
APPLAUSE IT'S
NOT EVEN CLOSE
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE
WE SPEND MORE ON OUR MILITARY THAN
THE NEXT EIGHT NATIONS COMBINED
OUR TROOPS ARE THE FINEST FIGHTING
FORCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
APPLAUSE ALL RIGHT
NO NATION
ATTACKS US DIRECTLY OR OUR ALLIES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT'S THE PATH
TO RUIN
SURVEYS SHOW OUR STANDING AROUND THE WORLD IS HIGHER THAN WHEN
I WAS ELECTED TO THIS OFFICE AND WHEN IT COMES TO EVERY IMPORTANT
INTERNATIONAL ISSUE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD DO NOT LOOK TO BEIJING OR
MOSCOW TO LEAD
THEY CALL US
SO I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO LEVEL SET HERE
BECAUSE WHEN WE DON'T WE DON'T MAKE GOOD DECISIONS
NOW AS SOMEONE WHO BEGINS EVERY DAY WITH AN INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING I
KNOW THIS IS A DANGEROUS TIME
BUT THAT'S NOT PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF SOME
LOOMING SUPERPOWER OUT THERE AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT BECAUSE OF
DIMINISHED AMERICAN STRENGTH
IN TODAY'S WORLD WE'RE THREATENED LESS
BY EVIL EMPIRES AND MORE BY FAILING STATES
THE MIDDLE EAST IS GOING THROUGH A TRANSFORMATION THAT WILL PLAY OUT
FOR A GENERATION ROOTED IN CONFLICTS THAT DATE BACK MILLENNIA
ECONOMIC HEADWINDS ARE BLOWING IN FROM A CHINESE ECONOMY THAT IS IN
SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION
EVEN AS THEIR ECONOMY SEVERELY CONTRACTS
RUSSIA IS POURING RESOURCES IN TO PROP UP UKRAINE AND SYRIA CLIENT
STATES THAT THEY SAW SLIPPING AWAY FROM THEIR ORBIT
AND THE
INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM WE BUILT AFTER WORLD WAR II IS NOW STRUGGLING TO
KEEP PACE WITH THIS NEW REALITY
IT'S UP TO US THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA TO HELP REMAKE THAT SYSTEM
AND TO DO THAT WELL IT MEANS THAT
WE'VE GOT TO SET PRIORITIES
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE IS PROTECTING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND GOING AFTER TERRORIST NETWORKS
BOTH AL QAIDA AND
NOW ISIL POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO OUR PEOPLE BECAUSE IN TODAY'S WORLD
EVEN A HANDFUL OF TERRORISTS WHO PLACE NO VALUE ON HUMAN LIFE
INCLUDING THEIR OWN CAN DO A LOT OF DAMAGE
THEY USE THE INTERNET TO
POISON THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INSIDE OUR COUNTRY
THEIR ACTIONS
UNDERMINE AND DESTABILIZE OUR ALLIES
WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM OUT
BUT AS WE FOCUS ON DESTROYING ISIL OVER THE TOP CLAIMS THAT THIS IS
WORLD WAR III JUST PLAY INTO THEIR HANDS
MASSES OF FIGHTERS ON THE
BACK OF PICKUP TRUCKS TWISTED SOULS PLOTTING IN APARTMENTS OR GARAGES
THEY POSE AN ENORMOUS DANGER TO CIVILIANS THEY HAVE TO BE STOPPED
BUT
THEY DO NOT THREATEN OUR NATIONAL EXISTENCE
THAT IS THE STORY ISIL
WANTS TO TELL
THAT'S THE KIND OF PROPAGANDA THEY USE TO RECRUIT
WE
DON'T NEED TO BUILD THEM UP TO SHOW THAT WE'RE SERIOUS AND WE SURE
DON'T NEED TO PUSH AWAY VITAL ALLIES IN THIS FIGHT BY ECHOING THE LIE
THAT ISIL IS SOMEHOW REPRESENTATIVE OF ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST
RELIGIONS
WE JUST NEED TO CALL THEM WHAT THEY ARE KILLERS AND
FANATICS WHO HAVE TO BE ROOTED OUT HUNTED DOWN AND DESTROYED
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AMERICA HAS
LED A COALITION OF MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES TO CUT OFF ISIL'S FINANCING
DISRUPT THEIR PLOTS STOP THE FLOW OF TERRORIST FIGHTERS AND STAMP OUT
THEIR VICIOUS IDEOLOGY
WITH NEARLY 10 000 AIRSTRIKES WE'RE TAKING OUT
THEIR LEADERSHIP THEIR OIL THEIR TRAINING CAMPS THEIR WEAPONS
WE'RE
TRAINING ARMING AND SUPPORTING FORCES WHO ARE STEADILY RECLAIMING
TERRITORY IN IRAQ AND SYRIA
IF THIS CONGRESS IS SERIOUS ABOUT WINNING THIS WAR AND WANTS TO SEND A
MESSAGE TO OUR TROOPS AND THE WORLD AUTHORIZE THE USE OF MILITARY
FORCE AGAINST ISIL
TAKE A VOTE
APPLAUSE TAKE A VOTE
BUT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THAT WITH OR WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION
ISIL WILL LEARN THE SAME LESSONS AS TERRORISTS BEFORE THEM
IF YOU
DOUBT AMERICA'S COMMITMENT OR MINE TO SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE JUST
ASK USAMA BIN LADEN
ASK THE LEADER OF AL QAIDA IN YEMEN WHO WAS TAKEN
OUT LAST YEAR OR THE PERPETRATOR OF THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS WHO SITS IN
A PRISON CELL
WHEN YOU COME AFTER AMERICANS WE GO AFTER YOU
AND IT
MAY TAKE TIME BUT WE HAVE LONG MEMORIES AND OUR REACH HAS NO LIMITS
OUR FOREIGN POLICY HAS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE THREAT FROM ISIL AND AL
QAIDA BUT IT CAN'T STOP THERE
FOR EVEN WITHOUT ISIL EVEN WITHOUT AL
QAIDA INSTABILITY WILL CONTINUE FOR DECADES IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD
IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN AFGHANISTAN AND PARTS OF PAKISTAN IN PARTS OF
CENTRAL AMERICA IN AFRICA AND ASIA
SOME OF THESE PLACES MAY BECOME
SAFE HAVENS FOR NEW TERRORIST NETWORKS
OTHERS WILL JUST FALL VICTIM TO
ETHNIC CONFLICT OR FAMINE FEEDING THE NEXT WAVE OF REFUGEES
THE WORLD
WILL LOOK TO US TO HELP SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS AND OUR ANSWER NEEDS TO
BE MORE THAN TOUGH TALK OR CALLS TO CARPET BOMB CIVILIANS
THAT MAY
WORK AS A TV SOUND BITE BUT IT DOESN'T PASS MUSTER ON THE WORLD STAGE
WE ALSO CAN'T TRY TO TAKE OVER AND REBUILD EVERY COUNTRY THAT FALLS
INTO CRISIS EVEN IF IT'S DONE WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS
THAT'S NOT
LEADERSHIP THAT'S A RECIPE FOR QUAGMIRE SPILLING AMERICAN BLOOD AND
TREASURE THAT ULTIMATELY WILL WEAKEN US
IT'S THE LESSON OF VIETNAM
IT'S THE LESSON OF IRAQ
AND WE SHOULD HAVE LEARNED IT BY NOW
NOW FORTUNATELY THERE IS A SMARTER APPROACH A PATIENT AND DISCIPLINED
STRATEGY THAT USES EVERY ELEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL POWER
IT SAYS AMERICA
WILL ALWAYS ACT ALONE IF NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE AND OUR
ALLIES BUT ON ISSUES OF GLOBAL CONCERN WE WILL MOBILIZE THE WORLD TO
WORK WITH US AND MAKE SURE OTHER COUNTRIES PULL THEIR OWN WEIGHT
THAT'S OUR APPROACH TO CONFLICTS LIKE SYRIA WHERE WE'RE PARTNERING
WITH LOCAL FORCES AND LEADING INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO HELP THAT BROKEN
SOCIETY PURSUE A LASTING PEACE
THAT'S WHY WE BUILT A GLOBAL COALITION
WITH SANCTIONS AND PRINCIPLED DIPLOMACY TO PREVENT A NUCLEAR ARMED
IRAN
AND AS WE SPEAK IRAN HAS ROLLED BACK ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM
SHIPPED OUT ITS URANIUM STOCKPILE AND THE WORLD HAS AVOIDED ANOTHER
WAR
THAT'S HOW WE STOPPED THE SPREAD OF EBOLA IN WEST AFRICA
OUR MILITARY
OUR DOCTORS OUR DEVELOPMENT WORKERS THEY WERE HEROIC THEY SET UP THE
PLATFORM THAT THEN ALLOWED OTHER COUNTRIES TO JOIN IN BEHIND US AND
STAMP OUT THAT EPIDEMIC
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MAYBE A COUPLE MILLION
LIVES WERE SAVED
THAT'S HOW WE FORGED A TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP TO OPEN MARKETS AND
PROTECT WORKERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND ADVANCE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN
ASIA
IT CUTS 18 000 TAXES ON PRODUCTS MADE IN AMERICA WHICH WILL THEN
SUPPORT MORE GOOD JOBS HERE IN AMERICA
WITH TPP CHINA DOES NOT SET
THE RULES IN THAT REGION WE DO
YOU WANT TO SHOW OUR STRENGTH IN THIS
NEW CENTURY APPROVE THIS AGREEMENT
GIVE US THE TOOLS TO ENFORCE IT
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO
LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE
FIFTY YEARS OF ISOLATING CUBA HAD
FAILED TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY
IT SET US BACK IN LATIN AMERICA
THAT'S
WHY WE RESTORED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS OPENED THE DOOR TO TRAVEL AND
COMMERCE POSITIONED OURSELVES TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE CUBAN PEOPLE
SO IF YOU WANT TO CONSOLIDATE OUR LEADERSHIP AND CREDIBILITY IN THE
HEMISPHERE RECOGNIZE THAT THE COLD WAR IS OVER
LIFT THE EMBARGO
THE POINT IS AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE 21ST CENTURY IS NOT A CHOICE
BETWEEN IGNORING THE REST OF THE WORLD EXCEPT WHEN WE KILL TERRORISTS
OR OCCUPYING AND REBUILDING WHATEVER SOCIETY IS UNRAVELING
LEADERSHIP
MEANS A WISE APPLICATION OF MILITARY POWER AND RALLYING THE WORLD
BEHIND CAUSES THAT ARE RIGHT
IT MEANS SEEING OUR FOREIGN ASSISTANCE AS
A PART OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY NOT SOMETHING SEPARATE NOT CHARITY
WHEN WE LEAD NEARLY 200 NATIONS TO THE MOST AMBITIOUS AGREEMENT IN
HISTORY TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE YES THAT HELPS VULNERABLE COUNTRIES
BUT IT ALSO PROTECTS OUR KIDS
WHEN WE HELP UKRAINE DEFEND ITS
DEMOCRACY OR COLOMBIA RESOLVE A DECADES LONG WAR THAT STRENGTHENS THE
INTERNATIONAL ORDER WE DEPEND ON
WHEN WE HELP AFRICAN COUNTRIES FEED
THEIR PEOPLE AND CARE FOR THE SICK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IT
PREVENTS THE NEXT PANDEMIC FROM REACHING OUR SHORES
RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON
TRACK TO END THE SCOURGE OF HIV AIDS
THAT'S WITHIN OUR GRASP
AND WE
HAVE THE CHANCE TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING WITH MALARIA SOMETHING
I'LL BE PUSHING THIS CONGRESS TO FUND THIS YEAR
THAT'S AMERICAN STRENGTH
THAT'S AMERICAN LEADERSHIP
AND THAT KIND OF
LEADERSHIP DEPENDS ON THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE
THAT'S WHY I WILL KEEP
WORKING TO SHUT DOWN THE PRISON AT GUANTANAMO
IT IS EXPENSIVE IT IS
UNNECESSARY AND IT ONLY SERVES AS A RECRUITMENT BROCHURE FOR OUR
ENEMIES
THERE'S A BETTER WAY
AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO REJECT ANY POLITICS ANY POLITICS THAT TARGETS
PEOPLE BECAUSE OF RACE OR RELIGION
LET ME JUST SAY THIS
THIS IS NOT A
MATTER OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS THIS IS A MATTER OF UNDERSTANDING JUST
WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES US STRONG
THE WORLD RESPECTS US NOT JUST FOR OUR
ARSENAL IT RESPECTS US FOR OUR DIVERSITY AND OUR OPENNESS AND THE WAY
WE RESPECT EVERY FAITH
HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS TOLD THIS BODY FROM THE VERY SPOT THAT I'M
STANDING ON TONIGHT THAT TO IMITATE THE HATRED AND VIOLENCE OF TYRANTS
AND MURDERERS IS THE BEST WAY TO TAKE THEIR PLACE WHEN POLITICIANS
INSULT MUSLIMS WHETHER ABROAD OR OUR FELLOW CITIZENS WHEN A MOSQUE IS
VANDALIZED OR A KID IS CALLED NAMES THAT DOESN'T MAKE US SAFER
THAT'S
NOT TELLING IT WHAT TELLING IT LIKE IT IS
IT'S JUST WRONG
IT
DIMINISHES US IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD
IT MAKES IT HARDER TO ACHIEVE
OUR GOALS
IT BETRAYS WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY
WE THE PEOPLE OUR
CONSTITUTION BEGINS WITH THOSE THREE SIMPLE WORDS WORDS WE'VE COME TO
RECOGNIZE MEAN ALL THE PEOPLE NOT JUST SOME WORDS THAT INSIST WE RISE
AND FALL TOGETHER THAT THAT'S HOW WE MIGHT PERFECT OUR UNION
AND THAT
BRINGS ME TO THE FOURTH AND MAYBE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I WANT TO
SAY TONIGHT
THE FUTURE WE WANT ALL OF US WANT OPPORTUNITY AND SECURITY FOR OUR
FAMILIES A RISING STANDARD OF LIVING A SUSTAINABLE PEACEFUL PLANET
FOR OUR KIDS ALL THAT IS WITHIN OUR REACH
BUT IT WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF
WE WORK TOGETHER
IT WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF WE CAN HAVE RATIONAL
CONSTRUCTIVE DEBATES
IT WILL ONLY HAPPEN IF WE FIX OUR POLITICS
A BETTER POLITICS DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING
THIS IS
A BIG COUNTRY DIFFERENT REGIONS DIFFERENT ATTITUDES DIFFERENT
INTERESTS
THAT'S ONE OF OUR STRENGTHS TOO
OUR FOUNDERS DISTRIBUTED
POWER BETWEEN STATES AND BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND EXPECTED US TO
ARGUE JUST AS THEY DID FIERCELY OVER THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF
GOVERNMENT OVER COMMERCE AND FOREIGN RELATIONS OVER THE MEANING OF
LIBERTY AND THE IMPERATIVES OF SECURITY
BUT DEMOCRACY DOES REQUIRE BASIC BONDS OF TRUST BETWEEN ITS CITIZENS
IT DOESN'T WORK IF WE THINK THE PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH US ARE ALL
MOTIVATED BY MALICE
IT DOESN'T WORK IF WE THINK THAT OUR POLITICAL
OPPONENTS ARE UNPATRIOTIC OR TRYING TO WEAKEN AMERICA
DEMOCRACY GRINDS
TO A HALT WITHOUT A WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE OR WHEN EVEN BASIC FACTS
ARE CONTESTED OR WHEN WE LISTEN ONLY TO THOSE WHO AGREE WITH US
OUR
PUBLIC LIFE WITHERS WHEN ONLY THE MOST EXTREME VOICES GET ALL THE
ATTENTION
AND MOST OF ALL DEMOCRACY BREAKS DOWN WHEN THE AVERAGE
PERSON FEELS THEIR VOICE DOESN'T MATTER THAT THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED IN
FAVOR OF THE RICH OR THE POWERFUL OR SOME SPECIAL INTEREST
TOO MANY AMERICANS FEEL THAT WAY RIGHT NOW
IT'S ONE OF THE FEW REGRETS
OF MY PRESIDENCY THAT THE RANCOR AND SUSPICION BETWEEN THE PARTIES HAS
GOTTEN WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER
I HAVE NO DOUBT A PRESIDENT WITH THE
GIFTS OF LINCOLN OR ROOSEVELT MIGHT HAVE BETTER BRIDGED THE DIVIDE AND
I GUARANTEE I'LL KEEP TRYING TO BE BETTER SO LONG AS I HOLD THIS
OFFICE
BUT MY FELLOW AMERICANS THIS CANNOT BE MY TASK OR ANY PRESIDENT'S
ALONE
THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF FOLKS IN THIS CHAMBER GOOD PEOPLE WHO
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE COOPERATION WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MORE ELEVATED
DEBATE IN WASHINGTON BUT FEEL TRAPPED BY THE IMPERATIVES OF GETTING
ELECTED BY THE NOISE COMING OUT OF YOUR BASE
I KNOW YOU'VE TOLD ME
IT'S THE WORST KEPT SECRET IN WASHINGTON
AND A LOT OF YOU AREN'T
ENJOYING BEING TRAPPED IN THAT KIND OF RANCOR
BUT THAT MEANS IF WE WANT A BETTER POLITICS AND I'M ADDRESSING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW IF WE WANT A BETTER POLITICS IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST
TO CHANGE A CONGRESSMAN OR CHANGE A SENATOR OR EVEN CHANGE A PRESIDENT
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM TO REFLECT OUR BETTER SELVES
I THINK WE'VE GOT TO END THE PRACTICE OF DRAWING OUR CONGRESSIONAL
DISTRICTS SO THAT POLITICIANS CAN PICK THEIR VOTERS AND NOT THE OTHER
WAY AROUND
LET A BIPARTISAN GROUP DO IT
I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN OUR POLITICS SO
THAT A HANDFUL OF FAMILIES OR HIDDEN INTERESTS CAN'T BANKROLL OUR
ELECTIONS
AND IF OUR EXISTING APPROACH TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM
CAN'T PASS MUSTER IN THE COURTS WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A
REAL SOLUTION
BECAUSE IT'S A PROBLEM
AND MOST OF YOU DON'T LIKE
RAISING MONEY
LAUGHTER I KNOW
I'VE DONE IT
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO VOTE NOT HARDER
WE NEED TO MODERNIZE
IT FOR THE WAY WE LIVE NOW
THIS IS AMERICA WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE
AND OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR I INTEND
TO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY TO PUSH FOR REFORMS THAT DO JUST THAT
BUT I
CAN'T DO THESE THINGS ON MY OWN
CHANGES IN OUR POLITICAL PROCESS IN
NOT JUST WHO GETS ELECTED BUT HOW THEY GET ELECTED THAT WILL ONLY
HAPPEN WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DEMAND IT
IT DEPENDS ON YOU
THAT'S
WHAT'S MEANT BY A GOVERNMENT OF BY AND FOR THE PEOPLE
WHAT I'M SUGGESTING IS HARD
IT'S A LOT EASIER TO BE CYNICAL TO ACCEPT
THAT CHANGE IS NOT POSSIBLE AND POLITICS IS HOPELESS AND THE PROBLEM IS
ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE ELECTED DON'T CARE AND TO BELIEVE THAT OUR
VOICES AND OUR ACTIONS DON'T MATTER
BUT IF WE GIVE UP NOW THEN WE
FORSAKE A BETTER FUTURE
THOSE WITH MONEY AND POWER WILL GAIN GREATER
CONTROL OVER THE DECISIONS THAT COULD SEND A YOUNG SOLDIER TO WAR OR
ALLOW ANOTHER ECONOMIC DISASTER OR ROLL BACK THE EQUAL RIGHTS AND
VOTING RIGHTS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT EVEN DIED TO
SECURE
AND THEN AS FRUSTRATION GROWS THERE WILL BE VOICES URGING US
TO FALL BACK INTO OUR RESPECTIVE TRIBES TO SCAPEGOAT FELLOW CITIZENS
WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE US OR PRAY LIKE US OR VOTE LIKE WE DO OR SHARE THE
SAME BACKGROUND
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO DOWN THAT PATH
IT WON'T DELIVER THE ECONOMY WE
WANT
IT WILL NOT PRODUCE THE SECURITY WE WANT
BUT MOST OF ALL IT
CONTRADICTS EVERYTHING THAT MAKES US THE ENVY OF THE WORLD
SO MY FELLOW AMERICANS WHATEVER YOU MAY BELIEVE WHETHER YOU PREFER
ONE PARTY OR NO PARTY WHETHER YOU SUPPORTED MY AGENDA OR FOUGHT AS
HARD AS YOU COULD AGAINST IT OUR COLLECTIVE FUTURES DEPENDS ON YOUR
WILLINGNESS TO UPHOLD YOUR DUTIES AS A CITIZEN
TO VOTE
TO SPEAK OUT
TO STAND UP FOR OTHERS ESPECIALLY THE WEAK ESPECIALLY THE VULNERABLE
KNOWING THAT EACH OF US IS ONLY HERE BECAUSE SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE STOOD
UP FOR US
WE NEED EVERY AMERICAN TO STAY ACTIVE IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE AND
NOT JUST DURING ELECTION TIME SO THAT OUR PUBLIC LIFE REFLECTS THE
GOODNESS AND THE DECENCY THAT I SEE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE
DAY
IT IS NOT EASY
OUR BRAND OF DEMOCRACY IS HARD
BUT I CAN PROMISE THAT
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR FROM NOW WHEN I NO LONGER HOLD THIS OFFICE I
WILL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU AS A CITIZEN INSPIRED BY THOSE VOICES OF
FAIRNESS AND VISION OF GRIT AND GOOD HUMOR AND KINDNESS THAT HAVE
HELPED AMERICA TRAVEL SO FAR
VOICES THAT HELP US SEE OURSELVES NOT
FIRST AND FOREMOST AS BLACK OR WHITE OR ASIAN OR LATINO NOT AS GAY OR
STRAIGHT IMMIGRANT OR NATIVE BORN NOT DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN BUT AS
AMERICANS FIRST BOUND BY A COMMON CREED
VOICES DR
KING BELIEVED
WOULD HAVE THE FINAL WORD VOICES OF UNARMED TRUTH AND UNCONDITIONAL
LOVE
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE THOSE VOICES
THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF ATTENTION
THEY DON'T SEEK A LOT OF FANFARE BUT THEY'RE BUSY DOING THE WORK THIS
COUNTRY NEEDS DOING
I SEE THEM EVERYWHERE I TRAVEL IN THIS INCREDIBLE
COUNTRY OF OURS
I SEE YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND IN YOUR DAILY ACTS
OF CITIZENSHIP I SEE OUR FUTURE UNFOLDING
I SEE IT IN THE WORKER ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE WHO CLOCKED EXTRA SHIFTS TO
KEEP HIS COMPANY OPEN AND THE BOSS WHO PAYS HIM HIGHER WAGES INSTEAD OF
LAYING HIM OFF
I SEE IT IN THE DREAMER WHO STAYS UP LATE AT NIGHT TO
FINISH HER SCIENCE PROJECT AND THE TEACHER WHO COMES IN EARLY MAYBE
WITH SOME EXTRA SUPPLIES THAT SHE BOUGHT BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT THAT
YOUNG GIRL MIGHT SOMEDAY CURE A DISEASE
I SEE IT IN THE AMERICAN WHO SERVED HIS TIME MADE BAD MISTAKES AS A
CHILD BUT NOW IS DREAMING OF STARTING OVER
AND I SEE IT IN THE
BUSINESS OWNER WHO GIVES HIM THAT SECOND CHANCE
THE PROTESTER
DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT JUSTICE MATTERS AND THE YOUNG COP WALKING THE
BEAT TREATING EVERYBODY WITH RESPECT DOING THE BRAVE QUIET WORK OF
KEEPING US SAFE
I SEE IT IN THE SOLDIER WHO GIVES ALMOST EVERYTHING TO SAVE HIS
BROTHERS THE NURSE WHO TENDS TO HIM TILL HE CAN RUN A MARATHON THE
COMMUNITY THAT LINES UP TO CHEER HIM ON
IT'S THE SON WHO FINDS THE
COURAGE TO COME OUT AS WHO HE IS AND THE FATHER WHOSE LOVE FOR THAT SON
OVERRIDES EVERYTHING HE'S BEEN TAUGHT
I SEE IT IN THE ELDERLY WOMAN WHO WILL WAIT IN LINE TO CAST HER VOTE AS
LONG AS SHE HAS TO THE NEW CITIZEN WHO CASTS HIS VOTE FOR THE FIRST
TIME THE VOLUNTEERS AT THE POLLS WHO BELIEVE EVERY VOTE SHOULD COUNT
BECAUSE EACH OF THEM IN DIFFERENT WAYS KNOW HOW MUCH THAT PRECIOUS
RIGHT IS WORTH
THAT'S THE AMERICA I KNOW
THAT'S THE COUNTRY WE LOVE CLEAR EYED BIG
HEARTED UNDAUNTED BY CHALLENGE
OPTIMISTIC THAT UNARMED TRUTH AND
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE WILL HAVE THE FINAL WORD
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME SO
HOPEFUL ABOUT OUR FUTURE
I BELIEVE IN CHANGE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AND THAT'S WHY I STAND HERE AS CONFIDENT AS I HAVE
EVER BEEN THAT THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG
THANK YOU
GOD BLESS YOU
GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
THANK
YOU
