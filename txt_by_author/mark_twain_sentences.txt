MASTERPIECES SERIES ETC
INTRODUCTION
THIS VOLUME DOES NOT AIM TO CONTAIN ALL THE BEST AMERICAN HUMOROUS
SHORT STORIES THERE ARE MANY OTHER STORIES EQUALLY AS GOOD I
SUPPOSE IN MUCH THE SAME VEIN SCATTERED THROUGH THE RANGE OF
AMERICAN LITERATURE
I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP A CERTAIN UNITY OF AIM AND
IMPRESSION IN SELECTING THESE STORIES
IN THE FIRST PLACE I DETERMINED
THAT THE PIECES OF BRIEF FICTION WHICH I INCLUDED MUST FIRST OF ALL BE
NOT MERELY GOOD STORIES BUT GOOD SHORT STORIES
I PUT MYSELF IN THE
POSITION OF ONE WHO WAS ABOUT TO SELECT THE BEST SHORT STORIES IN THE
WHOLE RANGE OF AMERICAN LITERATURE 1 BUT WHO JUST BEFORE HE STARTED
TO DO THIS WAS NOTIFIED THAT HE MUST REFRAIN FROM SELECTING ANY OF
THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES THAT DID NOT CONTAIN THE ELEMENT OF
HUMOR TO A MARKED DEGREE
BUT I HAVE KEPT IN MIND THE WIDE BOUNDARIES
OF THE TERM HUMOR AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE HUMOROUS STANDARD SHOULD
BE KEPT SECOND ALTHOUGH A CLOSE SECOND TO THE SHORT STORY STANDARD
IN VIEW OF THE NECESSARY LIMITATIONS AS TO THE VOLUME'S SIZE I COULD
NOT HOPE TO REPRESENT ALL PERIODS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE ADEQUATELY
NOR WAS THIS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GIVE EXAMPLES OF THE BEST THAT HAS
BEEN DONE IN THE SHORT STORY IN A HUMOROUS VEIN IN AMERICAN
LITERATURE
PROBABLY ALL TYPES OF THE SHORT STORY OF HUMOR ARE
INCLUDED HERE AT ANY RATE
NOT ONLY COPYRIGHT RESTRICTIONS BUT IN A
MEASURE MY OWN OPINION HAVE COMBINED TO EXCLUDE ANYTHING BY JOEL
CHANDLER HARRIS UNCLE REMUS FROM THE COLLECTION
HARRIS IS
PRIMARILY IN HIS BEST WORK A HUMORIST AND ONLY SECONDARILY A SHORT
STORY WRITER
AS A HUMORIST HE IS OF THE FIRST RANK AS A WRITER OF
SHORT STORIES HIS PLACE IS HARDLY SO HIGH
HIS HUMOR IS NOT MERE
FUNNINESS AND DIVERSION HE IS A HUMORIST IN THE FUNDAMENTAL AND LARGE
SENSE AS ARE CERVANTES RABELAIS AND MARK TWAIN
NO BOOK IS DULLER THAN A BOOK OF JOKES FOR WHAT IS REFRESHING IN
SMALL DOSES BECOMES NAUSEATING WHEN PERUSED IN LARGE ASSIGNMENTS
HUMOR IN LITERATURE IS AT ITS BEST NOT WHEN SERVED MERELY BY ITSELF
BUT WHEN PRESENTED ALONG WITH OTHER INGREDIENTS OF LITERARY FORCE IN
ORDER TO GIVE A WIDE REPRESENTATION OF LIFE
THEREFORE PROFESSIONAL
LITERARY HUMORISTS AS THEY MAY BE CALLED HAVE NOT BEEN MUCH
CONSIDERED IN MAKING UP THIS COLLECTION
IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN
HUMOR THERE ARE THREE NAMES WHICH STAND OUT MORE PROMINENTLY THAN ALL
OTHERS BEFORE MARK TWAIN WHO HOWEVER ALSO BELONGS TO A WIDER
CLASSIFICATION JOSH BILLINGS HENRY WHEELER SHAW 1815 1885
PETROLEUM V
NASBY DAVID ROSS LOCKE 1833 1888 AND ARTEMUS WARD
CHARLES FARRAR BROWNE 1834 1867
IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN HUMOR
THESE NAMES RANK HIGH IN THE FIELD OF AMERICAN LITERATURE AND THE
AMERICAN SHORT STORY THEY DO NOT RANK SO HIGH
I HAVE FOUND NOTHING OF
THEIRS THAT WAS FIRST CLASS BOTH AS HUMOR AND AS SHORT STORY
PERHAPS
JUST BELOW THESE THREE SHOULD BE MENTIONED GEORGE HORATIO DERBY
1823 1861 AUTHOR OF PHOENIXIANA 1855 AND THE SQUIBOB PAPERS
1859 WHO WROTE UNDER THE NAME JOHN PHOENIX AS HAS BEEN JUSTLY
SAID DERBY SHAW LOCKE AND BROWNE CARRIED TO AN EXTREME NUMEROUS
TRICKS ALREADY INVENTED BY EARLIER AMERICAN HUMORISTS PARTICULARLY
THE TRICKS OF GIGANTIC EXAGGERATION AND CALM FACED MENDACITY BUT THEY
ARE PLAINLY IN THE MAIN CHANNEL OF AMERICAN HUMOR WHICH HAD ITS
ORIGIN IN THE FIRST COMMENTS OF SETTLERS UPON THE CONDITIONS OF THE
FRONTIER LONG DREW ITS PRINCIPAL INSPIRATION FROM THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THAT FRONTIER AND THE MORE SETTLED AND COMPACT REGIONS OF THE
COUNTRY AND REACHED ITS HIGHEST DEVELOPMENT IN MARK TWAIN IN HIS
YOUTH A CHILD OF THE AMERICAN FRONTIER ADMIRER AND IMITATOR OF DERBY
AND BROWNE AND EVENTUALLY A MAN OF THE WORLD AND ONE OF ITS GREATEST
HUMORISTS 2 NOR HAVE SUCH LATER WRITERS WHO WERE ESSENTIALLY
HUMORISTS AS BILL NYE EDGAR WILSON NYE 1850 1896 BEEN CONSIDERED
BECAUSE THEIR WORK DOES NOT ATTAIN THE LITERARY STANDARD AND THE SHORT
STORY STANDARD AS CREDITABLY AS IT DOES THE HUMOROUS ONE
WHEN WE COME
TO THE CLOSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE WORK OF SUCH MEN AS MR
DOOLEY FINLEY PETER DUNNE 1867 AND GEORGE ADE 1866 STANDS
OUT
BUT WHILE THESE TWO WRITERS SUCCESSFULLY CONFORM TO THE EXACTING
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS OF GOOD HUMOR AND ESPECIALLY THE FORMER OF
GOOD LITERATURE NEITHER THOUGH ADE MORE SO ATTAINS TO THE GREATEST
EXCELLENCE OF THE SHORT STORY
MR
DOOLEY OF THE ARCHEY ROAD IS
ESSENTIALLY A WHOLESOME AND WIDE POISED HUMOROUS PHILOSOPHER AND THE
AUTHOR OF FABLES IN SLANG IS CHIEFLY A SATIRIST WHETHER IN FABLE
PLAY OR WHAT NOT
THIS VOLUME MIGHT WELL HAVE STARTED WITH SOMETHING BY WASHINGTON
IRVING I SUPPOSE MANY CRITICS WOULD SAY
IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME
HOWEVER THAT IRVING'S BEST SHORT STORIES SUCH AS THE LEGEND OF
SLEEPY HOLLOW AND RIP VAN WINKLE ARE ESSENTIALLY HUMOROUS STORIES
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE O'ERSPREAD WITH THE GENIAL LIGHT OF REMINISCENCE
IT
IS THE ARMCHAIR GENIALITY OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY ESSAYISTS A
CONSTITUENT OF THE AUTHOR RATHER THAN OF HIS MATERIAL AND PRODUCT
IRVING'S BEST HUMOROUS CREATIONS INDEED ARE SCARCELY SHORT STORIES
AT ALL BUT RATHER ESSAYLIKE SKETCHES OR SKETCHLIKE ESSAYS
JAMES
LAWSON 1799 1880 IN HIS TALES AND SKETCHES BY A COSMOPOLITE
1830 NOTABLY IN THE DAPPER GENTLEMAN'S STORY IS ALSO PLAINLY A
FOLLOWER OF IRVING
WE COME TO A DIFFERENT VEIN IN THE WORK OF SUCH
WRITERS AS WILLIAM TAPPAN THOMPSON 1812 1882 AUTHOR OF THE AMUSING
STORIES IN LETTER FORM MAJOR JONES'S COURTSHIP 1840 JOHNSON
JONES HOOPER 1815 1862 AUTHOR OF WIDOW RUGBY'S HUSBAND AND OTHER
TALES OF ALABAMA 1851 JOSEPH G
BALDWIN 1815 1864 WHO WROTE
THE FLUSH TIMES OF ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI 1853 AND AUGUSTUS
BALDWIN LONGSTREET 1790 1870 WHOSE GEORGIA SCENES 1835 ARE AS
IMPORTANT IN LOCAL COLOR AS THEY ARE RACY IN HUMOR
YET NONE OF
THESE WRITERS YIELD THE EXCELLENT SHORT STORY WHICH IS ALSO A GOOD
PIECE OF HUMOROUS LITERATURE
BUT THEY OPENED THE WAY FOR THE WORK OF
LATER WRITERS WHO DID ATTAIN THESE COMBINED EXCELLENCES
THE SENTIMENTAL VEIN OF THE MIDCENTURY IS SEEN IN THE WORK OF SEBA
SMITH 1792 1868 ELIZA LESLIE 1787 1858 FRANCES MIRIAM WHITCHER
WIDOW BEDOTT 1811 1852 MARY W
JANVRIN 1830 1870 AND ALICE
BRADLEY HAVEN NEAL 1828 1863
THE WELL KNOWN WORK OF JOSEPH CLAY
NEAL 1807 1847 IS SO ALL PERVADED WITH CARICATURE AND HUMOR THAT IT
BELONGS WITH THE WORK OF THE PROFESSIONAL HUMORIST SCHOOL RATHER THAN
WITH THE SHORT STORY WRITERS
TO MENTION HIS CHARCOAL SKETCHES OR
SCENES IN A METROPOLIS 1837 1849 MUST SUFFICE
THE WORK OF SEBA
SMITH IS SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSED IN HIS TITLE WAY DOWN EAST OR
PORTRAITURES OF YANKEE LIFE 1854 ALTHOUGH HIS LETTERS OF MAJOR
JACK DOWNING 1833 IS BETTER KNOWN
OF HIS SINGLE STORIES MAY BE
MENTIONED THE GENERAL COURT AND JANE ANDREWS' FIRKIN OF BUTTER
OCTOBER 1847 GRAHAM'S MAGAZINE
THE WORK OF FRANCES MIRIAM
WHITCHER WIDOW BEDOTT IS OF SOMEWHAT FINER GRAIN BOTH AS HUMOR
AND IN OTHER LITERARY QUALITIES
HER STORIES OR SKETCHES SUCH AS
AUNT MAGWIRE'S ACCOUNT OF PARSON SCRANTUM'S DONATION PARTY MARCH
1848 GODEY'S LADY'S BOOK AND AUNT MAGWIRE'S ACCOUNT OF THE
MISSION TO MUFFLETEGAWMY JULY 1859 GODEY'S WERE AFTERWARDS
COLLECTED IN THE WIDOW BEDOTT PAPERS 1855 56 80
THE SCOPE OF THE
WORK OF MARY B
HAVEN IS SUFFICIENTLY SUGGESTED BY HER STORY MRS
BOWEN'S PARLOR AND SPARE BEDROOM FEBRUARY 1860 GODEY'S WHILE
THE BEST STORIES OF MARY W
JANVRIN INCLUDE THE FOREIGN COUNT OR
HIGH ART IN TATTLETOWN OCTOBER 1860 GODEY'S AND CITY
RELATIONS OR THE NEWMANS' SUMMER AT CLOVERNOOK NOVEMBER 1861
GODEY'S
THE WORK OF ALICE BRADLEY HAVEN NEAL IS OF SOMEWHAT
SIMILAR TEXTURE
HER BOOK THE GOSSIPS OF RIVERTOWN WITH SKETCHES IN
PROSE AND VERSE 1850 INDICATES HER FIELD AS DOES THE SINGLE TITLE
THE THIRD CLASS HOTEL DECEMBER 1861 GODEY'S
PERHAPS THE MOST
REPRESENTATIVE FIGURE OF THIS SCHOOL IS ELIZA LESLIE 1787 1858 WHO
AS MISS LESLIE WAS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE
MAGAZINES OF THE 1830'S 1840'S AND 1850'S
ONE OF HER BEST STORIES IS
THE WATKINSON EVENING DECEMBER 1846 GODEY'S LADY'S BOOK
INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME OTHERS ARE THE BATSON COTTAGE
NOVEMBER 1846 GODEY'S LADY'S BOOK AND JULIET IRWIN OR THE
CARRIAGE PEOPLE JUNE 1847 GODEY'S LADY'S BOOK
ONE OF HER CHIEF
COLLECTIONS OF STORIES IS PENCIL SKETCHES 1833 1837
MISS
LESLIE WROTE EDGAR ALLAN POE IS CELEBRATED FOR THE HOMELY
NATURALNESS OF HER STORIES AND FOR THE BROAD SATIRE OF HER COMIC
STYLE SHE WAS THE EDITOR OF THE GIFT ONE OF THE BEST ANNUALS OF
THE TIME AND IN THAT POSITION PERHAPS EXERTED HER CHIEF INFLUENCE ON
AMERICAN LITERATURE WHEN ONE HAS READ THREE OR FOUR REPRESENTATIVE
STORIES BY THESE SEVEN AUTHORS ONE CAN GRASP THEM ALL
THEIR TITLES AS
A RULE STRIKE THE KEYNOTE
THESE WRITERS EXCEPT THE WIDOW BEDOTT
ARE PERHAPS SENTIMENTALISTS RATHER THAN HUMORISTS IN INTENTION BUT
READ IN THE LIGHT OF LATER DAYS THEIR APPARENT SERIOUS DELINEATIONS OF
THE FROLICS AND FOIBLES OF THEIR TIME TAKE ON A HIGHLY HUMOROUS
ASPECT
GEORGE POPE MORRIS 1802 1864 WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE NEW
YORK MIRROR AND FOR A TIME ITS EDITOR
HE IS BEST KNOWN AS THE
AUTHOR OF THE POEM WOODMAN SPARE THAT TREE AND OTHER POEMS AND
SONGS
THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN AND HIS WATER LOTS 1839 THE FIRST
STORY IN THE PRESENT VOLUME IS SELECTED NOT BECAUSE MORRIS WAS
ESPECIALLY PROMINENT IN THE FIELD OF THE SHORT STORY OR HUMOROUS PROSE
BUT BECAUSE OF THIS SINGLE STORY'S REPRESENTATIVE CHARACTER
EDGAR
ALLAN POE 1809 1849 FOLLOWS WITH THE ANGEL OF THE ODD OCTOBER
1844 COLUMBIAN MAGAZINE PERHAPS THE BEST OF HIS HUMOROUS STORIES
THE SYSTEM OF DR
TARR AND PROF
FETHER NOVEMBER 1845 GRAHAM'S
MAGAZINE MAY BE RATED HIGHER BUT IT IS NOT ESSENTIALLY A HUMOROUS
STORY
RATHER IT IS INCISIVE SATIRE WITH TOO BITING AN UNDERCURRENT
TO PASS MUSTER IN THE COMPANY OF THE GENIAL IN LITERATURE
POE'S
HUMOROUS STORIES AS A WHOLE HAVE TENDED TO BELITTLE RATHER THAN
INCREASE HIS FAME MANY OF THEM VERGING ON THE INANE
THERE ARE SOME
HOWEVER WHICH ARE AT LEAST EXCELLENT FOOLING FEW MORE THAN THAT
PROBABLY THIS IS HARDLY THE PLACE FOR AN EXTENDED DISCUSSION OF POE
SINCE THE PRESENT VOLUME COVERS NEITHER AMERICAN LITERATURE AS A WHOLE
NOR THE AMERICAN SHORT STORY IN GENERAL AND POE IS NOT A HUMORIST IN
HIS MORE NOTABLE PRODUCTIONS
LET IT BE SAID THAT POE INVENTED OR
PERFECTED MORE EXACTLY PERFECTED HIS OWN INVENTION OF THE MODERN
SHORT STORY THAT IS HIS GENERAL AND SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT
HE ALSO
STANDS SUPERLATIVE FOR THE QUALITY OF THREE VARIETIES OF SHORT
STORIES THOSE OF TERROR BEAUTY AND RATIOCINATION
IN THE FIRST CLASS
BELONG A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM 1841 THE PIT AND THE
PENDULUM 1842 THE BLACK CAT 1843 AND THE CASK OF
AMONTILLADO 1846
IN THE REALM OF BEAUTY HIS NOTABLE PRODUCTIONS
ARE THE ASSIGNATION 1834 SHADOW A PARABLE 1835 LIGEIA
1838 THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER 1839 ELEONORA 1841
AND THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH 1842
THE TALES OF
RATIOCINATION WHAT ARE NOW GENERALLY TERMED DETECTIVE
STORIES INCLUDE THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE 1841 AND ITS
SEQUEL THE MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGT 1842 1843 THE GOLD BUG
1843 THE OBLONG BOX 1844 THOU ART THE MAN 1844 AND THE
PURLOINED LETTER 1844
THEN TOO POE WAS A MASTER OF STYLE ONE OF THE GREATEST IN ENGLISH
PROSE POSSIBLY THE GREATEST SINCE DE QUINCEY AND QUITE THE MOST
REMARKABLE AMONG AMERICAN AUTHORS
POE'S INFLUENCE ON THE SHORT STORY
FORM HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS
ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF STRUCTURE MAY BE
ASTOUNDING IN THEIR POWER OR UNEXPECTEDNESS YET THE MEANS BY WHICH
THESE EFFECTS ARE BROUGHT ABOUT ARE PURELY MECHANICAL
ANY STUDENT OF
FICTION CAN COMPREHEND THEM ALMOST ANY PRACTITIONER OF FICTION WITH A
BENT TOWARD FORM CAN FAIRLY MASTER THEM
THE MERIT OF ANY SHORT STORY
PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON MANY OTHER ELEMENTS AS WELL THE VALUE OF THE
STRUCTURAL ELEMENT TO THE PRODUCTION AS A WHOLE DEPENDS FIRST ON THE
SELECTION OF THE PARTICULAR SORT OF STRUCTURAL SCHEME BEST SUITED TO
THE STORY IN HAND AND SECONDLY ON THE WAY IN WHICH THIS IS
COMBINED WITH THE PIECE OF WRITING TO FORM A WELL BALANCED WHOLE
STYLE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO IMITATE THAN STRUCTURE BUT ON THE OTHER
HAND THE ORIGIN OF STRUCTURAL INFLUENCE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO TRACE
THAN THAT OF STYLE
SO WHILE IN A GENERAL WAY WE FEEL THAT POE'S
INFLUENCE ON STRUCTURE IN THE SHORT STORY HAS BEEN GREAT IT IS
DIFFICULT RATHER THAN OBVIOUS TO TRACE PARTICULAR INSTANCES
IT IS
FELT IN THE ADVANCE OF THE GENERAL LEVEL OF SHORT STORY ART
THERE IS
NOTHING PERSONAL ABOUT STRUCTURE THERE IS EVERYTHING PERSONAL ABOUT
STYLE
POE'S STYLE IS BOTH TOO MUCH HIS OWN AND TOO SUPERLATIVELY GOOD
TO BE SUCCESSFULLY IMITATED WHOM HAVE WE HAD WHO EVEN IF HE WERE A
MASTER OF STRUCTURAL EFFECTS COULD BE A SECOND POE LOOKING AT THE
MATTER IN ANOTHER WAY POE'S STYLE IS NOT HIS OWN AT ALL
THERE IS
NOTHING PERSONAL ABOUT IT IN THE PETTY SENSE OF THAT TERM
RATHER WE
FEEL THAT IN THE CASE OF THIS AUTHOR UNIVERSALITY HAS BEEN ATTAINED
IT WAS POE'S GOOD FORTUNE TO BE HIMSELF IN STYLE AS OFTEN IN CONTENT
ON A PLANE OF UNIVERSAL APPEAL
BUT IN SOME GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF
HIS STYLE HIS WORK CAN BE NOT PERHAPS IMITATED BUT EMULATED
GREATER
VIVIDNESS DEFT IMPRESSIONISM BREVITY THAT STRIKES INSTANTLY TO A
TELLING EFFECT ALL THESE AN AUTHOR MAY HAVE WITHOUT IMITATING ANY
ONE'S STYLE BUT RATHER IMITATING EXCELLENCE
POE'S IMITATORS WHO
HAVE AMOUNTED TO ANYTHING HAVE NOT TRIED TO IMITATE HIM BUT TO VIE
WITH HIM
THEY ARE STRIVING AFTER PERFECTIONISM
OF COURSE THE SORT OF
GOOD STYLE IN WHICH POE INDULGED IS NOT THE KIND OF STYLE OR THE
VARIETIES OF STYLE SUITED FOR ALL PURPOSES BUT FOR THE PURPOSES TO
WHICH IT IS ADAPTED IT MAY WELL BE CALLED SUPREME
THEN AS A POET HIS WORK IS ALMOST OR QUITE AS EXCELLENT IN A SOMEWHAT
MORE RESTRICTED RANGE
IN VERSE HE IS PROBABLY THE BEST ARTIST IN
AMERICAN LETTERS
HERE HIS SOLE PURSUIT WAS BEAUTY BOTH OF FORM AND
THOUGHT HE IS VIVID AND APT INTENSELY LYRICAL BUT WITHOUT MUCH RANGE
OF THOUGHT
HE HAS DEEP INTUITIONS BUT NO COMPREHENSIVE GRASP OF LIFE
HIS CRITICISM IS ON THE WHOLE THE LEAST IMPORTANT PART OF HIS WORK
HE HAD A FEW GOOD AND BRILLIANT IDEAS WHICH CAME AT JUST THE RIGHT
TIME TO MAKE A STIR IN THE WORLD AND THESE HIS LOGICAL MIND AND
TELLING STYLE ENABLED HIM TO PRESENT TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE
AS A
CRITIC HE IS NEITHER BROAD MINDED LEARNED NOR COMPREHENSIVE
NOR IS
HE EXCEPT IN THE FEW IDEAS REFERRED TO DEEP
HE IS HOWEVER
LIMITEDLY ORIGINAL PERHAPS INTENSELY ORIGINAL WITHIN HIS NARROW
SCOPE
BUT THE EXCELLENCES AND LIMITATIONS OF POE IN ANY ONE PART OF
HIS WORK WERE HIS LIMITATIONS AND EXCELLENCES IN ALL
AS POE'S BEST SHORT STORIES MAY BE MENTIONED METZENGERSTEIN JAN

POE'S CHIEF COLLECTIONS
ARE TALES OF THE GROTESQUE AND ARABESQUE 1840 TALES 1845
AND THE WORKS OF THE LATE EDGAR ALLAN POE 1850 56
THESE TITLES
HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM RECENT EDITIONS OF HIS WORKS HOWEVER AND THE
STORIES BROUGHT TOGETHER UNDER THE TITLE TALES OR UNDER
SUBDIVISIONS FURNISHED BY HIS EDITORS SUCH AS TALES OF
RATIOCINATION ETC
CAROLINE MATILDA STANSBURY KIRKLAND 1801 1864 WROTE OF THE FRONTIER
LIFE OF THE MIDDLE WEST IN THE MID NINETEENTH CENTURY
HER PRINCIPAL
COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES IS WESTERN CLEARINGS 1845 FROM WHICH
THE SCHOOLMASTER'S PROGRESS FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE GIFT FOR 1845
OUT IN 1844 IS TAKEN
OTHER STORIES REPUBLISHED IN THAT COLLECTION
ARE THE BALL AT THRAM'S HUDDLE APRIL 1840 KNICKERBOCKER
MAGAZINE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE LAND FEVER SEPTEMBER 1840
KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE AND THE BEE TREE THE GIFT FOR 1842
OUT IN 1841
HER DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER A PUPPET
CUT OUT OF SHINGLE AND JERKED BY A STRING AND THE LOCAL COLOR IN
GENERAL OF THIS AND OTHER STORIES GIVE HER A LEADING PLACE AMONG THE
WRITERS OF HER PERIOD WHO COMBINED FIDELITY IN DELINEATING FRONTIER
LIFE WITH SUFFICIENT FICTIONAL INTEREST TO MAKE A PLEASING WHOLE OF
PERMANENT VALUE
GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS 1824 1892 GAINED HIS CHIEF FAME AS AN
ESSAYIST AND PROBABLY BECAME BEST KNOWN FROM THE DEPARTMENT WHICH HE
CONDUCTED FROM 1853 AS THE EDITOR'S EASY CHAIR FOR HARPER'S
MAGAZINE FOR MANY YEARS
HIS VOLUME PRUE AND I 1856 CONTAINS
MANY FICTIONAL ELEMENTS AND A STORY FROM IT TITBOTTOM'S
SPECTACLES WHICH FIRST APPEARED IN PUTNAM'S MONTHLY FOR DECEMBER
1854 IS GIVEN IN THIS VOLUME BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD HUMOROUS SHORT
STORY RATHER THAN BECAUSE OF ITS AUTHOR'S GENERAL EMINENCE IN THIS
FIELD
OTHER STORIES OF HIS WORTH NOTING ARE THE SHROUDED PORTRAIT
IN THE KNICKERBOCKER GALLERY 1855 AND THE MILLENIAL CLUB
NOVEMBER 1858 KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE
EDWARD EVERETT HALE 1822 1909 IS CHIEFLY KNOWN AS THE AUTHOR OF THE
SHORT STORY THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY DECEMBER 1863 ATLANTIC
MONTHLY BUT HIS VENTURE IN THE COMIC VEIN MY DOUBLE AND HOW HE
UNDID ME SEPTEMBER 1859 ATLANTIC MONTHLY IS EQUALLY WORTHY OF
APPRECIATION
IT WAS HIS FIRST PUBLISHED STORY OF IMPORTANCE
OTHER
NOTEWORTHY STORIES OF HIS ARE THE BRICK MOON OCTOBER NOVEMBER AND
DECEMBER 1869 ATLANTIC MONTHLY LIFE IN THE BRICK MOON
FEBRUARY 1870 ATLANTIC MONTHLY AND SUSAN'S ESCORT MAY 1890
HARPER'S MAGAZINE
HIS CHIEF VOLUMES OF SHORT STORIES ARE THE MAN
WITHOUT A COUNTRY AND OTHER TALES 1868 THE BRICK MOON AND OTHER
STORIES 1873 CRUSOE IN NEW YORK AND OTHER TALES 1880 AND
SUSAN'S ESCORT AND OTHERS 1897
THE STORIES BY HALE WHICH HAVE
MADE HIS FAME ALL SHOW ABILITY OF NO MEAN ORDER BUT THEY ARE
CHARACTERIZED BY INVENTION AND INGENUITY RATHER THAN BY SUFFUSING
IMAGINATION
THERE IS NOT MUCH HOMOGENEITY ABOUT HALE'S WORK
ALMOST
ANY TWO STORIES OF HIS READ AS IF THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY
DIFFERENT AUTHORS
FOR THE TIME BEING PERHAPS THIS IS AN
ADVANTAGE HIS STORIES CHARM BY THEIR NOVELTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
IN
THE LONG RUN HOWEVER THIS PROVES RATHER A HANDICAP
TRUE
INDIVIDUALITY IN LITERATURE AS IN THE OTHER ARTS CONSISTS NOT IN
BEING DIFFERENT ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS IN DIFFERENT WORKS SO MUCH
AS IN BEING SAMELY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER WRITERS IN BEING
CONSISTENTLY ONE'S SELF RATHER THAN DIFFUSEDLY VARIOUS SELVES
THIS
DOES NOT LESSEN THE VALUE OF PARTICULAR STORIES OF COURSE
IT MERELY
INJURES HALE'S FAME AS A WHOLE
PERHAPS SOME WILL CHIEFLY FEEL NOT SO
MUCH THAT HIS STORIES ARE DIFFERENT AMONG THEMSELVES BUT THAT THEY
ARE NOT STRONGLY ANYTHING ANYBODY'S IN PARTICULAR THAT THEY LACK
STRONG PERSONALITY
THE PATHWAY TO FAME IS STREWN WITH STRAY
EXHIBITIONS OF TALENT
APART FROM HIS PURELY LITERARY PRODUCTIONS
HALE WAS ONE OF THE LARGE MORAL FORCES OF HIS TIME THROUGH UPLIFT
BOTH IN SPEECH AND THE WRITTEN WORD
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES 1809 1894 ONE OF THE LEADING WITS OF AMERICAN
LITERATURE IS NOT AT ALL WELL KNOWN AS A SHORT STORY WRITER NOR DID
HE WRITE MANY BRIEF PIECES OF FICTION
HIS FAME RESTS CHIEFLY ON HIS
POEMS AND ON THE BREAKFAST TABLE BOOKS 1858 1860 1872 1890
OLD
IRONSIDES THE LAST LEAF THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS AND HOMESICK IN
HEAVEN ARE SECURE OF PLACES IN THE ANTHOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE WHILE
HIS LIGHTER VERSE HAS MADE HIM ONE OF THE LEADING AMERICAN WRITERS OF
FAMILIAR VERSE FREDERICK LOCKER LAMPSON IN THE PREFACE TO THE FIRST
EDITION OF HIS LYRA ELEGANTIARUM 1867 DECLARED THAT HOLMES WAS
PERHAPS THE BEST LIVING WRITER OF THIS SPECIES OF VERSE HIS
TRENCHANT ATTACK ON HOMEOPATHY AND ITS KINDRED DELUSIONS 1842
MAKES US WONDER WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SOME OF THE
BELIEFS OF OUR OWN DAY CHRISTIAN SCIENCE FOR EXAMPLE
HE MIGHT HAVE
EXPOSED IT UNDER SOME SUCH TITLE AS THE RELIGIO MEDICAL
MASQUERADE OR BROUGHT THE BATTERIES OF HIS HUMOR TO BEAR ON IT IN
THE MANNER OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON'S FABLE SOMETHING IN IT
PERHAPS THERE IS NOT MUCH IN IT AS I SUPPOSED BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING IN IT AFTER ALL
LET ME BE THANKFUL FOR THAT IN HOLMES'
LONG WORKS OF FICTION ELSIE VENNER 1861 THE GUARDIAN ANGEL
1867 AND A MORTAL ANTIPATHY 1885 THE METHOD IS STILL SOMEWHAT
THAT OF THE ESSAYIST
I HAVE FOUND A SHORT PIECE OF FICTION BY HIM IN
THE MARCH 1832 NUMBER OF THE NEW ENGLAND MAGAZINE CALLED THE
DBUT SIGNED O W H
THE STORY OF IRIS IN THE PROFESSOR AT THE
BREAKFAST TABLE WHICH RAN IN THE ATLANTIC THROUGHOUT 1859 AND A
VISIT TO THE ASYLUM FOR AGED AND DECAYED PUNSTERS JANUARY 1861
ATLANTIC ARE HIS ONLY OTHER BRIEF FICTIONS OF WHICH I AM AWARE
THE
LAST NAMED HAS BEEN GIVEN PLACE IN THE PRESENT SELECTION BECAUSE IT IS
CHARACTERISTIC OF A CERTAIN TYPE AND PERIOD OF AMERICAN HUMOR
ALTHOUGH ITS SHORT STORY QUALITIES ARE NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG
SAMUEL LANGHORNE CLEMENS 1835 1910 WHO ACHIEVED FAME AS MARK
TWAIN IS ONLY INCIDENTALLY A SHORT STORY WRITER ALTHOUGH HE WROTE
MANY SHORT PIECES OF FICTION
HIS HUMOROUS QUALITY I MEAN IS SO
PREPONDERANT THAT ONE HARDLY THINKS OF THE FORM
INDEED HE IS NEVER
VERY STRONG IN FICTIONAL CONSTRUCTION AND OF THE MODERN SHORT STORY
ART HE EVIDENTLY KNEW OR CARED LITTLE
HE IS A HUMORIST IN THE LARGE
SENSE AS ARE RABELAIS AND CERVANTES ALTHOUGH HE IS ALSO A HUMORIST
IN VARIOUS RESTRICTED APPLICATIONS OF THE WORD THAT ARE WHOLLY
AMERICAN
THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY WAS HIS
FIRST PUBLICATION OF IMPORTANCE AND IT SAW THE LIGHT IN THE NOV
18
1865 NUMBER OF THE SATURDAY PRESS
IT WAS REPUBLISHED IN THE
COLLECTION THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY AND
OTHER SKETCHES IN 1867
OTHERS OF HIS BEST PIECES OF SHORT FICTION
ARE THE CANVASSER'S TALE DECEMBER 1876 ATLANTIC MONTHLY THE
1 000 000 BANK NOTE JANUARY 1893 CENTURY MAGAZINE THE
ESQUIMAU MAIDEN'S ROMANCE NOVEMBER 1893 COSMOPOLITAN

HARRY STILLWELL EDWARDS 1855 A NATIVE OF GEORGIA TOGETHER WITH
SARAH BARNWELL ELLIOTT AND WILL N
HARBEN 1858 1919 HAVE
CONTINUED IN THE VEIN OF THAT EARLIER WRITER AUGUSTUS BALDWIN
LONGSTREET 1790 1870 AUTHOR OF GEORGIA SCENES 1835
EDWARDS'
BEST WORK IS TO BE FOUND IN HIS SHORT STORIES OF BLACK AND WHITE LIFE
AFTER THE MANNER OF RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON
HE HAS WRITTEN SEVERAL
NOVELS BUT HE IS ESSENTIALLY A WRITER OF HUMAN NATURE SKETCHES
HE
IS HUMOROUS AND PICTURESQUE SAYS FRED LEWIS PATTEE AND OFTEN HE IS
FOR A MOMENT THE MASTER OF PATHOS BUT HE HAS ADDED NOTHING NEW AND
NOTHING COMMANDINGLY DISTINCTIVE 3 AN EXCEPTION TO THIS MIGHT BE
MADE IN FAVOR OF ELDER BROWN'S BACKSLIDE AUGUST 1885 HARPER'S
A STORY IN WHICH ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE SO NICELY BALANCED THAT THE
RESULT MAY WELL BE CALLED A MASTERPIECE OF OBJECTIVE HUMOR AND PATHOS
OTHERS OF HIS SHORT STORIES ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF MENTION ARE TWO
RUNAWAYS JULY 1886 CENTURY SISTER TODHUNTER'S HEART JULY
1887 CENTURY DE VALLEY AN' DE SHADDER JANUARY 1888
CENTURY AN IDYL OF SINKIN' MOUNT'IN OCTOBER 1888
CENTURY THE RIVAL SOULS MARCH 1889 CENTURY THE WOODHAVEN
GOAT MARCH 1899 CENTURY AND THE SHADOW DECEMBER 1906
CENTURY
HIS CHIEF COLLECTIONS ARE TWO RUNAWAYS AND OTHER
STORIES 1889 AND HIS DEFENSE AND OTHER STORIES 1898
THE MOST NOTABLE HOWEVER OF THE GROUP OF SHORT STORY WRITERS OF
GEORGIA LIFE IS PERHAPS RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON 1822 1898
HE
STANDS BETWEEN LONGSTREET AND THE YOUNGER WRITERS OF GEORGIA LIFE
HIS
FIRST BOOK WAS GEORGIA SKETCHES BY AN OLD MAN 1864
THE GOOSE
POND SCHOOL A SHORT STORY HAD BEEN WRITTEN IN 1857 IT WAS NOT
PUBLISHED HOWEVER TILL IT APPEARED IN THE NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER
1869 NUMBERS OF A SOUTHERN MAGAZINE THE NEW ECLECTIC OVER THE
PSEUDONYM PHILEMON PERCH HIS FAMOUS DUKESBOROUGH TALES
1871 1874 WAS LARGELY A REPUBLICATION OF THE EARLIER BOOK

JOHNSTON MUST BE RANKED ALMOST WITH BRET HARTE AS A
PIONEER IN LOCAL COLOR WORK ALTHOUGH HIS WORK HAD LITTLE
RECOGNITION UNTIL HIS DUKESBOROUGH TALES WERE REPUBLISHED BY HARPER
BROTHERS IN 1883
BRET HARTE 1839 1902 IS MENTIONED HERE OWING TO THE LATE DATE OF HIS
STORY INCLUDED IN THIS VOLUME COLONEL STARBOTTLE FOR THE PLAINTIFF
MARCH 1901 HARPER'S ALTHOUGH HIS WORK AS A WHOLE OF COURSE
BELONGS TO AN EARLIER PERIOD OF OUR LITERATURE
IT IS NOW WELL THUMBED
LITERARY HISTORY THAT THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP AUGUST 1868
OVERLAND AND THE OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT JANUARY 1869
OVERLAND BROUGHT HIM A POPULARITY THAT IN ITS SUDDENNESS AND
EXTENT HAD NO PRECEDENT IN AMERICAN LITERATURE SAVE IN THE CASE OF
MRS
STOWE AND UNCLE TOM'S CABIN
ACCORDING TO HARTE'S OWN
STATEMENT MADE IN THE RETROSPECT OF LATER YEARS HE SET OUT
DELIBERATELY TO ADD A NEW PROVINCE TO AMERICAN LITERATURE
ALTHOUGH
HIS WORK HAS BEEN BELITTLED BECAUSE HE HAS CHOSEN EXCEPTIONAL AND
THEATRIC HAPPENINGS YET HIS REAL STRENGTH CAME FROM HIS CONTACT WITH
WESTERN LIFE
IRVING AND DICKENS AND OTHER MODELS SERVED ONLY TO TEACH HIM HIS ART
FINALLY SAYS PROF
PATTEE HARTE WAS THE PARENT OF THE MODERN FORM
OF THE SHORT STORY
IT WAS HE WHO STARTED KIPLING AND CABLE AND THOMAS
NELSON PAGE
FEW INDEED HAVE SURPASSED HIM IN THE MECHANICS OF THIS
MOST DIFFICULT OF ARTS
ACCORDING TO HIS OWN BELIEF THE FORM IS AN
AMERICAN PRODUCT
HARTE HAS DESCRIBED THE GENESIS OF HIS OWN ART
IT SPRANG FROM THE WESTERN HUMOR AND WAS DEVELOPED BY THE
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SURROUNDED HIM
MANY OF HIS SHORT STORIES ARE
MODELS
THEY CONTAIN NOT A SUPERFLUOUS WORD THEY HANDLE A SINGLE
INCIDENT WITH GRAPIC POWER THEY CLOSE WITHOUT MORAL OR COMMENT
THE
FORM CAME AS A NATURAL EVOLUTION FROM HIS LIMITATIONS AND POWERS
WITH
HIM THE STORY MUST OF NECESSITY BE BRIEF
BRET HARTE WAS THE ARTIST
OF IMPULSE THE PAINTER OF SINGLE BURNING MOMENTS THE FLASHLIGHT
PHOTOGRAPHER WHO CAUGHT IN LURID DETAIL ONE DRAMATIC EPISODE IN THE
LIFE OF A MAN OR A COMMUNITY AND LEFT THE REST IN DARKNESS 4
HARTE'S HUMOR IS MOSTLY WESTERN HUMOR THERE IS NOT ALWAYS UPROARIOUS
MERRIMENT BUT THERE IS A CONSTANT BACKGROUND OF HUMOR
I KNOW OF NO
MORE AMUSING SCENE IN AMERICAN LITERATURE THAN THAT IN THE COURTROOM
WHEN THE COLONEL GIVES HIS VERSION OF THE DEACON'S METHOD OF SIGNALING
TO THE WIDOW IN HARTE'S STORY INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME COLONEL
STARBOTTLE FOR THE PLAINTIFF
HERE IS PART OF IT
TRUE TO THE INSTRUCTIONS SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM HIM HER LIPS PART IN
THE MUSICAL UTTERANCE THE COLONEL LOWERED HIS VOICE IN A FAINT
FALSETTO PRESUMABLY IN FOND IMITATION OF HIS FAIR CLIENT KERREE
INSTANTLY THE NIGHT BECOMES RESONANT WITH THE IMPASSIONED REPLY THE
COLONEL HERE LIFTED HIS VOICE IN STENTORIAN TONES KERROW AGAIN
AS HE PASSES RISES THE SOFT KERREE AGAIN AS HIS FORM IS LOST IN
THE DISTANCE COMES BACK THE DEEP KERROW
WHILE HARTE'S STORIES ALL HAVE IN THEM A CERTAIN ELEMENT OR BACKGROUND
OF HUMOR YET PERHAPS THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE CHIEFLY ROMANTIC OR
DRAMATIC EVEN MORE THAN THEY ARE HUMOROUS
AMONG THE BEST OF HIS SHORT STORIES MAY BE MENTIONED THE LUCK OF
ROARING CAMP AUGUST 1868 OVERLAND THE OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT
JANUARY 1869 OVERLAND TENNESSEE'S PARTNER OCTOBER 1869
OVERLAND BROWN OF CALAVERAS MARCH 1870 OVERLAND FLIP A

AMONG
HIS NOTABLE COLLECTIONS OF STORIES ARE THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP AND
OTHER SKETCHES 1870 FLIP AND OTHER STORIES 1882 ON THE
FRONTIER 1884 COLONEL STARBOTTLE'S CLIENT AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE
1892 A PROTG OF JACK HAMLIN'S AND OTHER STORIES 1894 THE

THE TITLES AND
MAKEUP OF SEVERAL OF HIS COLLECTIONS WERE CHANGED WHEN THEY CAME TO BE
ARRANGED IN THE COMPLETE EDITION OF HIS WORKS 5
HENRY CUYLER BUNNER 1855 1896 IS ONE OF THE HUMOROUS GENIUSES OF
AMERICAN LITERATURE
HE IS EQUALLY AT HOME IN CLEVER VERSE OR THE
BRIEF SHORT STORY
PROF
FRED LEWIS PATTEE HAS SUMMED UP HIS
ACHIEVEMENT AS FOLLOWS ANOTHER THAN STOCKTON WHO DID MUCH TO
ADVANCE THE SHORT STORY TOWARD THE MECHANICAL PERFECTION IT HAD
ATTAINED TO AT THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY WAS HENRY CUYLER BUNNER
EDITOR OF PUCK AND CREATOR OF SOME OF THE MOST EXQUISITE VERS DE
SOCIT OF THE PERIOD
THE TITLE OF ONE OF HIS COLLECTIONS MADE IN
FRANCE FRENCH TALES RETOLD WITH A U S
TWIST 1893 FORMS AN
INTRODUCTION TO HIS FICTION
NOT THAT HE WAS AN IMITATOR FEW HAVE
BEEN MORE ORIGINAL OR HAVE PUT MORE OF THEIR OWN PERSONALITY INTO
THEIR WORK
HIS GENIUS WAS GALLIC
LIKE ALDRICH HE APPROACHED THE
SHORT STORY FROM THE FASTIDIOUS STANDPOINT OF THE LYRIC POET
WITH
HIM AS WITH ALDRICH ART WAS A MATTER OF EXQUISITE TOUCHES OF
INFINITE COMPRESSION OF ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SHADINGS
THE LURID
SPLASHES AND THE HEAVY EMPHASIS OF THE LOCAL COLORISTS OFFENDED HIS
SENSITIVE TASTE HE WOULD WORK WITH SUGGESTION WITH MICROSCOPIC
FOCUSSINGS AND ALWAYS WITH DIGNITY AND ELEGANCE
HE WAS MORE AMERICAN
THAN HENRY JAMES MORE EVEN THAN ALDRICH
HE CHOSE ALWAYS
DISTINCTIVELY AMERICAN SUBJECTS NEW YORK CITY WAS HIS FAVORITE
THEME AND HIS WORK HAD MORE DEPTH OF SOUL THAN STOCKTON'S OR
ALDRICH'S
THE STORY MAY BE TRIVIAL A MERE EXPANDED ANECDOTE YET IT
IS SURE TO BE SO VITALLY TREATED THAT LIKE MAUPASSANT'S WORK IT
GRIPS AND REMAINS AND WHAT IS MORE IT LIFTS AND CHASTENS OR
EXPLAINS
IT MAY BE SAID WITH ASSURANCE THAT SHORT SIXES MARKS ONE
OF THE HIGH PLACES WHICH HAVE BEEN ATTAINED BY THE AMERICAN SHORT
STORY 6
AMONG BUNNER'S BEST STORIES ARE LOVE IN OLD CLOATHES SEPTEMBER
1883 CENTURY A SUCCESSFUL FAILURE JULY 1887 PUCK THE
LOVE LETTERS OF SMITH JULY 23 1890 PUCK THE NICE PEOPLE JULY

PUCK OUR AROMATIC UNCLE AUGUST 1895 SCRIBNER'S THE
TIME TABLE TEST IN THE SUBURBAN SAGE 1896
HE COLLABORATED WITH
PROF
BRANDER MATTHEWS IN SEVERAL STORIES NOTABLY IN THE DOCUMENTS
IN THE CASE SEPT 1879 SCRIBNER'S MONTHLY
HIS BEST COLLECTIONS
ARE SHORT SIXES STORIES TO BE READ WHILE THE CANDLE BURNS 1891
MORE SHORT SIXES 1894 AND LOVE IN OLD CLOATHES AND OTHER
STORIES 1896
AFTER POE AND HAWTHORNE ALMOST THE FIRST AUTHOR IN AMERICA TO MAKE A
VERTIGINOUS IMPRESSION BY HIS SHORT STORIES WAS BRET HARTE
THE WIDE
AND SUDDEN POPULARITY HE ATTAINED BY THE PUBLICATION OF HIS TWO SHORT
STORIES THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP 1868 AND THE OUTCASTS OF POKER
FLAT 1869 HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED 7 BUT ONE STORY JUST BEFORE
HARTE THAT ASTONISHED THE FICTION AUDIENCE WITH ITS POWER AND ART WAS
HARRIET PRESCOTT SPOFFORD'S 1835 THE AMBER GODS JANUARY AND
FEBRUARY 1860 ATLANTIC WITH ITS STARTLING ENDING I MUST HAVE
DIED AT TEN MINUTES PAST ONE AFTER HARTE THE NEXT STORY TO MAKE A
GREAT SENSATION WAS THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH'S MARJORIE DAW APRIL
1873 ATLANTIC A STORY WITH A SURPRISE AT THE END AS HAD BEEN HIS
A STRUGGLE FOR LIFE JULY 1867 ATLANTIC ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY
MARJORIE DAW THAT ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION AT THE TIME
THEN CAME
GEORGE WASHINGTON CABLE'S 1844 POSSON JONE' APRIL 1 1876
APPLETON'S JOURNAL AND A LITTLE LATER CHARLES EGBERT CRADDOCK'S
1850 THE DANCIN' PARTY AT HARRISON'S COVE MAY 1878
ATLANTIC AND THE STAR IN THE VALLEY NOVEMBER 1878 ATLANTIC
BUT THE WORK OF CABLE AND CRADDOCK THOUGH OF STERLING WORTH WON ITS
WAY GRADUALLY
EVEN EDWARD EVERETT HALE'S 1822 1909 MY DOUBLE AND
HOW HE UNDID ME SEPTEMBER 1859 ATLANTIC AND THE MAN WITHOUT A
COUNTRY DECEMBER 1863 ATLANTIC HAD FALLEN COMPARATIVELY
STILL BORN
THE TRULY ASTOUNDING SHORT STORY SUCCESSES AFTER POE AND
HAWTHORNE THEN WERE SPOFFORD BRET HARTE AND ALDRICH
NEXT CAME
FRANK RICHARD STOCKTON 1834 1902
THE INTEREST CREATED BY THE
APPEARANCE OF MARJORIE DAW SAYS PROF
PATTEE WAS MILD COMPARED
WITH THAT ACCORDED TO FRANK R
STOCKTON'S THE LADY OR THE TIGER
1884
STOCKTON HAD NOT THE TECHNIQUE OF ALDRICH NOR HIS NATURALNESS
AND EASE
CERTAINLY HE HAD NOT HIS ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEAU MONDE AND
HIS GRACE OF STYLE BUT IN WHIMSICALITY AND UNEXPECTEDNESS AND IN THAT
SUBTLE ART THAT MAKES THE OBVIOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE SEEM PERFECTLY
PLAUSIBLE AND COMMONPLACE HE SURPASSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT EDWARD EVERETT
HALE AND ALL OTHERS
AFTER STOCKTON AND THE LADY OR THE TIGER IT
WAS REALIZED EVEN BY THE UNCRITICAL THAT SHORT STORY WRITING HAD
BECOME A SUBTLE ART AND THAT THE MASTER OF ITS SUBTLETIES HAD HIS
READER AT HIS MERCY 8 THE PUBLICATION OF STOCKTON'S SHORT STORIES
COVERS A PERIOD OF OVER FORTY YEARS FROM MAHALA'S DRIVE NOVEMBER
1868 LIPPINCOTT'S TO THE TROUBLE SHE CAUSED WHEN SHE KISSED
DECEMBER 1911 LADIES' HOME JOURNAL PUBLISHED NINE YEARS AFTER

THEN STANDING RATHER EACH BY HIMSELF ARE MELVILLE DAVISSON POST
1871 A MASTER OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MYSTERY STORIES AND WILBUR DANIEL
STEELE 1886 WHOSE WORK IT IS HARD TO CLASSIFY
THESE TEN NAMES
REPRESENT MUCH THAT IS BEST IN AMERICAN SHORT STORY PRODUCTION SINCE
THE BEGINNING OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 1900
NOT ALL ARE NOTABLE FOR
HUMOR BUT INASMUCH AS ANY CONSIDERATION OF THE AMERICAN HUMOROUS
SHORT STORY CANNOT BE WHOLLY DISSOCIATED FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THE
AMERICAN SHORT STORY IN GENERAL IT HAS SEEMED NOT AMISS TO MENTION
THESE AUTHORS HERE
ALTHOUGH SARAH ORNE JEWETT 1849 1909 LIVED ON
INTO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND MARY E
WILKINS FREEMAN 1862 IS
STILL WITH US THE BEST AND MOST TYPICAL WORK OF THESE TWO WRITERS

O
HENRY WAS THE PEN NAME ADOPTED BY WILLIAM SYDNEY PORTER
HE BEGAN
HIS SHORT STORY CAREER BY CONTRIBUTING WHISTLING DICK'S CHRISTMAS
STOCKING TO MCCLURE'S MAGAZINE IN 1899
HE FOLLOWED IT WITH MANY
STORIES DEALING WITH WESTERN AND SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICAN LIFE AND
LATER CAME MOST OF HIS STORIES OF THE LIFE OF NEW YORK CITY IN WHICH
FIELD LIES MOST OF HIS BEST WORK
HE CONTRIBUTED MORE STORIES TO THE
NEW YORK WORLD THAN TO ANY OTHER ONE PUBLICATION AS IF THE STORIES
OF THE AUTHOR WHO LATER CAME TO BE HAILED AS THE AMERICAN MAUPASSANT
WERE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE LEADING MAGAZINES BUT FIT ONLY FOR THE
SENSATION LOVING PUBLIC OF THE SUNDAY PAPERS HIS FIRST PUBLISHED
STORY THAT SHOWED DISTINCT STRENGTH WAS PERHAPS A BLACKJACK
BARGAINER AUGUST 1901 MUNSEY'S
HE FOLLOWED THIS WITH SUCH
MASTERLY STORIES AS THE DUPLICITY OF HARGRAVES FEBRUARY 1902
JUNIOR MUNSEY THE MARIONETTES APRIL 1902 BLACK CAT A
RETRIEVED REFORMATION APRIL 1903 COSMOPOLITAN THE GUARDIAN OF
THE ACCOLADE MAY 1903 COSMOPOLITAN THE ENCHANTED KISS

1910 BRICKDUST ROW IN THE TRIMMED LAMP 1910 AND THE
ASSESSOR OF SUCCESS IN THE TRIMMED LAMP 1910
AMONG O
HENRY'S
BEST VOLUMES OF SHORT STORIES ARE THE FOUR MILLION 1909
OPTIONS 1909 ROADS OF DESTINY 1909 THE TRIMMED LAMP
1910 STRICTLY BUSINESS MORE STORIES OF THE FOUR MILLION 1910
WHIRLIGIGS 1910 AND SIXES AND SEVENS 1911
NOWHERE IS THERE ANYTHING JUST LIKE THEM
IN HIS BEST WORK AND HIS
TALES OF THE GREAT METROPOLIS ARE HIS BEST HE IS UNIQUE
THE SOUL OF
HIS ART IS UNEXPECTEDNESS
HUMOR AT EVERY TURN THERE IS AND SENTIMENT
AND PHILOSOPHY AND SURPRISE
ONE NEVER MAY BE SURE OF HIMSELF
THE END
IS ALWAYS A SENSATION
NO FORESIGHT MAY PREDICT IT AND THE SENSATION
ALWAYS IS GENUINE
WHATEVER ELSE O
HENRY WAS HE WAS AN ARTIST A
MASTER OF PLOT AND DICTION A GENUINE HUMORIST AND A PHILOSOPHER
HIS
WEAKNESS LAY IN THE VERY NATURE OF HIS ART
HE WAS AN ENTERTAINER BENT
ONLY ON AMUSING AND SURPRISING HIS READER
EVERYWHERE BRILLIANCY BUT
TOO OFTEN IT IS JOINED TO CHEAPNESS ART YET ART MERGING SWIFTLY INTO
CARICATURE
LIKE HARTE HE CANNOT BE TRUSTED
BOTH WRITERS ON THE
WHOLE MAY BE SAID TO HAVE LOWERED THE STANDARDS OF AMERICAN
LITERATURE SINCE BOTH WORKED IN THE SURFACE OF LIFE WITH THEATRIC
INTENT AND ALWAYS WITHOUT MORAL BACKGROUND O
HENRY MOVES BUT HE
NEVER LIFTS
ALL IS FORTISSIMO HE SLAPS THE READER ON THE BACK AND
LAUGHS LOUDLY AS IF HE WERE IN A BAR ROOM
HIS CHARACTERS WITH FEW
EXCEPTIONS ARE EXTREMES CARICATURES
EVEN HIS SHOP GIRLS IN THE
LIMNING OF WHOM HE DID HIS BEST WORK ARE NOT REALLY INDIVIDUALS
RATHER ARE THEY TYPES SYMBOLS
HIS WORK WAS LITERARY VAUDEVILLE
BRILLIANT HIGHLY AMUSING AND YET VAUDEVILLE 9 THE DUPLICITY OF
HARGRAVES THE STORY BY O
HENRY GIVEN IN THIS VOLUME IS FREE FROM
MOST OF HIS DEFECTS
IT HAS A BLEND OF HUMOR AND PATHOS THAT PUTS IT
ON A PLANE OF UNIVERSAL APPEAL
GEORGE RANDOLPH CHESTER 1869 GAINED DISTINCTION BY CREATING THE
GENIAL MODERN BUSINESS MAN OF AMERICAN LITERATURE WHO IS NOT CONTENT
TO GET RICH QUICK THROUGH THE ORDINARY CHANNELS
NEED I SAY THAT I
REFER TO THAT AMAZING COMPOUND OF LIKEABLENESS AND SHARP PRACTICES
GET RICH QUICK WALLINGFORD THE STORY OF HIS INCLUDED IN THIS VOLUME
BARGAIN DAY AT TUTT HOUSE JUNE 1905 MCCLURE'S WAS NEARLY HIS

IT IS OFTEN
DIFFICULT TO FIND IN HIS BOOKS SHORT STORIES THAT ONE MAY BE LOOKING
FOR FOR THE REASON THAT THE TITLES OF THE INDIVIDUAL STORIES HAVE
BEEN REMOVED IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BOOKS LOOK LIKE NOVELS SUBDIVIDED
INTO CHAPTERS
GRACE MACGOWAN COOKE 1863 IS A WRITER ALL OF WHOSE WORK HAS
INTEREST AND PERDURABLE STUFF IN IT BUT FEW ARE THE AUTHORS WHOSE
ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE AMERICAN SHORT STORY STAND OUT AS A WHOLE
IN A
CALL AUGUST 1906 HARPER'S SHE SURPASSES HERSELF AND IS NOT
PERHAPS HERSELF SURPASSED BY ANY OF THE HUMOROUS SHORT STORIES THAT
HAVE COME TO THE FORE SO FAR IN AMERICA IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
THE
STORY IS NO LESS DELIGHTFUL IN ITS FIDELITY TO FACT AND UNDERSTANDING
OF YOUNG HUMAN NATURE THAN IN ITS RELISH OF HUMOR
SOME OF HER STORIES

GLORY 1910 AND SEVERAL GOOD JUVENILES
WILLIAM JAMES LAMPTON 1917 WHO WAS KNOWN TO MANY OF HIS ADMIRERS
AS WILL LAMPTON OR AS W J L
MERELY WAS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE AND
INTERESTING CHARACTERS OF LITERARY AND BOHEMIAN NEW YORK FROM ABOUT
1895 TO HIS DEATH IN 1917
I REMEMBER WALKING UP FIFTH AVENUE WITH HIM
ONE SUNDAY AFTERNOON JUST AFTER HE HAD SHOWN ME A LETTER FROM THE MAN
WHO WAS THEN COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY
THE LETTER WAS SIGNED SO
ILLEGIBLY THAT MY COMPANION WAS IN DOUBTS AS TO THE SENDER SO HE
SUGGESTED THAT WE STOP AT A WELL KNOWN HOTEL AT THE CORNER OF 59TH
STREET AND ASK THE MANAGER WHO THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY THEN
WAS SO THAT HE MIGHT KNOW WHOM THE LETTER WAS FROM
HE SAID THAT THE
MANAGER OF A BIG HOTEL LIKE THAT WHERE MANY PROMINENT PEOPLE STAYED
WOULD BE SURE TO KNOW
WHEN THIS PROBLEM HAD BEEN SOLVED TO OUR
SATISFACTION JOHN SKELTON WILLIAMS PROVING TO BE THE MAN LAMPTON
SAID NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME WHO HE IS I'LL SHOW YOU WHO I AM SO HE
ASKED FOR A COPY OF THE AMERICAN MAGAZINE AT A NEWSSTAND IN THE
HOTEL CORRIDOR OPENED IT AND SHOWED THE MANAGER A FULL PAGE PICTURE
OF HIMSELF CLAD IN A COSTUME SUGGESTIVE OF THE TIME OF CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS WITH HIGH RUFFS AROUND HIS NECK THAT HAPPENED TO APPEAR IN
THE MAGAZINE THE CURRENT MONTH
I MENTION THIS INCIDENT TO ILLUSTRATE
THE LACK OF CONVENTIONALITY AND WHIMSICAL ORIGINALITY OF THE MAN THAT
STOOD OUT NO LESS FORCIBLY IN HIS WRITINGS THAN IN HIS DAILY LIFE
HE
HAD LITTLE USE FOR DOING THE USUAL THING IN THE USUAL SORT OF WAY
HE FIRST GAINED PROMINENCE BY HIS BOOK OF VERSE YAWPS 1900
HIS
POEMS WERE FREE FROM CONVENTION IN TECHNIQUE AS WELL AS IN SPIRIT
ALTHOUGH THEIR CHIEF INNOVATION WAS SIMPLY THAT AS A RULE THERE WAS NO
REGULAR NUMBER OF SYLLABLES IN A LINE HE LET THE LINES BE ANY LENGTH
THEY WANTED TO BE TO FIT THE SENSE OR THE LENGTH OF WHAT HE HAD TO
SAY
HE ONCE SAID TO ME THAT IF ANYTHING OF HIS WAS REMEMBERED HE
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HIS POEM LO THE SUMMER GIRL
HIS MUSE OFTEN
TOOK THE DIRECTION OF SATIRE BUT IT WAS ALWAYS GOOD NATURED EVEN WHEN
IT HIT THE HARDEST
HE HAD IN HIS MAKEUP MUCH OF THE DETACHED
PHILOSOPHER LIKE CERVANTES AND MARK TWAIN
THERE WAS SOMETHING COSMIC ABOUT HIS ATTITUDE TO LIFE AND THIS SHOWED
IN MUCH THAT HE DID
HE WAS THE ONLY AMERICAN WRITER OF HUMOROUS VERSE
OF HIS DAY WHOM I ALWAYS CARED TO READ OR WHOSE LINES I COULD
REMEMBER MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS
THIS WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HIS WORK WAS
NEVER MERELY HUMOROUS BUT ALWAYS HAD A BIG SWEEP OF BACKGROUND TO
IT LIKE THE RUGGEDNESS OF THE KENTUCKY MOUNTAINS FROM WHICH HE CAME
IT WAS COLONEL GEORGE HARVEY THEN EDITOR OF HARPER'S WEEKLY WHO
HAD STARTED THE BOOM TO MAKE WOODROW WILSON PRESIDENT
WILSON
AFTERWARDS AT LEAST SEEMINGLY REPUDIATED HIS SPONSOR PROBABLY
BECAUSE OF HARVEY'S IDENTIFICATION WITH VARIOUS MONEYED INTERESTS
LAMPTON'S POEM ON THE SUBJECT WITH ITS REFRAIN NEVER AGAIN SAID
COLONEL GEORGE I REMEMBER AS ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE OF HIS POEMS ON
CURRENT TOPICS
BUT WHAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME THE BEST OF HIS POEMS
DEALING WITH MATTERS OF THE HOUR WAS ONE THAT I SUGGESTED HE WRITE
WHICH DEALT WITH GIFT GIVING TO THE PUBLIC AT ABOUT THE TIME THAT
ANDREW CARNEGIE WAS MAKING A BIG STIR WITH HIS GIFTS FOR LIBRARIES
BEGINNING
DUNNO PERHAPS
ONE OF THE YAPS
LIKE ME WOULD MAKE
A HOLY BREAK
DOING HIS TURN
WITH MONEY TO BURN
ANYHOW I
WOULDN'T SHY
MAKING A TRY
AND CONTAINING AMONG MANY EFFECTIVE TOUCHES THE PATHETIC LINES
I'D HELP
THE POOR WHO TRY TO HELP THEMSELVES
WHO HAVE TO WORK SO HARD FOR BREAD
THEY CAN'T GET VERY FAR AHEAD
WHEN JAMES LANE ALLEN'S NOVEL THE REIGN OF LAW CAME OUT 1900 A
LITTLE QUATRAIN BY LAMPTON THAT APPEARED IN THE BOOKMAN SEPTEMBER
1900 SWEPT LIKE WILDFIRE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WAS READ BY A
HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AS THE BOOK ITSELF
THE REIGN OF LAW
WELL ALLEN YOU'RE LUCKY
IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT EVER
RAINED LAW IN KENTUCKY
THE READER NEED NOT BE REMINDED THAT AT THAT PERIOD KENTUCKY FAMILY
FEUDS WERE WELL TO THE FORE
AS LAMPTON HAD STARTED AS A POET THE
EDITORS WERE BOUND TO KEEP HIM PIGEON HOLED AS FAR AS THEY COULD AND
HIS AMBITION TO WRITE SHORT STORIES WAS NOT AT FIRST MUCH ENCOURAGED
BY THEM
HIS PREDICAMENT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF THE CHIEF
CHARACTER OF FRANK R
STOCKTON'S STORY HIS WIFE'S DECEASED SISTER
JANUARY 1884 CENTURY WHO HAD WRITTEN A STORY SO GOOD THAT
WHENEVER HE BROUGHT THE EDITORS ANOTHER STORY THEY INVARIABLY ANSWERED
IN SUBSTANCE WE'RE AFRAID IT WON'T DO
CAN'T YOU GIVE US SOMETHING
LIKE HIS WIFE'S DECEASED SISTER THIS WAS MERELY STOCKTON'S
TURNING TO ACCOUNT HIS OWN SOMEWHAT SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WITH THE
EDITORS AFTER HIS STORY THE LADY OR THE TIGER NOVEMBER 1882
CENTURY APPEARED
LIKEWISE THE EDITORS DIDN'T WANT LAMPTON'S SHORT
STORIES FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THEY LIKED HIS POEMS SO WELL
DO I HEAR SOME CRITICS EXCLAIMING THAT THERE IS NOTHING REMARKABLE
ABOUT HOW THE WIDOW WON THE DEACON THE STORY BY LAMPTON INCLUDED IN
THIS VOLUME IT HANDLES AN AMUSING SITUATION LIGHTLY AND WITH GRACE
IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT READ EASILY AND ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO
ACHIEVE
AMONG HIS BEST STORIES ARE THE PEOPLE'S NUMBER OF THE
WORTHYVILLE WATCHMAN MAY 12 1900 SATURDAY EVENING POST LOVE'S
STRANGE SPELL APRIL 27 1901 SATURDAY EVENING POST ABIMELECH
HIGGINS' WAY AUGUST 24 1001 SATURDAY EVENING POST A CUP OF

THERE IS NO COLLECTION AS YET OF HIS SHORT STORIES
ALTHOUGH FAMILIARLY KNOWN AS COLONEL LAMPTON AND ALTHOUGH OF
KENTUCKY HE WAS NOT MERELY A KENTUCKY COLONEL FOR HE WAS ACTUALLY
APPOINTED COLONEL ON THE STAFF OF THE GOVERNOR OF KENTUCKY
AT THE
TIME OF HIS DEATH HE WAS ABOUT TO BE MADE A BRIGADIER GENERAL AND WAS
PLANNING TO RAISE A BRIGADE OF KENTUCKY MOUNTAINEERS FOR SERVICE IN
THE GREAT WAR
AS HE HAD JUST STRUCK HIS STRIDE IN SHORT STORY
WRITING THE LOSS TO LITERATURE WAS EVEN GREATER THAN THE PATRIOTIC
LOSS
GIDEON APRIL 1914 CENTURY BY WELLS HASTINGS 1878 THE
STORY WITH WHICH THIS VOLUME CLOSES CALLS TO MIND THE LARGE NUMBER OF
NOTABLE SHORT STORIES IN AMERICAN LITERATURE BY WRITERS WHO HAVE MADE
NO LARGE NAME FOR THEMSELVES AS SHORT STORY WRITERS OR EVEN OTHERWISE
IN LETTERS
AMERICAN LITERATURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONG IN ITS STRAY
SHORT STORIES OF NOTE
IN MR
HASTINGS' CASE HOWEVER I FEEL THAT THE
FAME IS SURE TO COME
HE GRADUATED FROM YALE IN 1902 COLLABORATED
WITH BRIAN HOOKER 1880 IN A NOVEL THE PROFESSOR'S MYSTERY
1911 AND ALONE WROTE ANOTHER NOVEL THE MAN IN THE BROWN DERBY
1911
HIS SHORT STORIES INCLUDE THE NEW LITTLE BOY JULY 1911
AMERICAN THAT DAY SEPTEMBER 1911 AMERICAN THE PICK UP
DECEMBER 1911 EVERYBODY'S AND GIDEON APRIL 1914
CENTURY
THE LAST STORY STANDS OUT
IT CAN BE COMPARED WITHOUT
DISADVANTAGE TO THE BEST WORK OR ALL BUT THE VERY BEST WORK OF
THOMAS NELSON PAGE IT SEEMS TO ME
AND FROM THE READER'S STANDPOINT
IT HAS THE ADVANTAGE IS THIS NOT ALSO AN AUTHOR'S ADVANTAGE OF A
MORE MODERN SETTING AND TREATMENT
MR
HASTINGS IS I HAVE BEEN TOLD
A DIRECTOR IN OVER A DOZEN LARGE CORPORATIONS
LET US HOPE THAT HIS
BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WILL NOT KEEP HIM TOO MUCH AWAY FROM THE
PRODUCTION OF LITERATURE FOR TO RANK AS A PIECE OF LITERATURE
SOMETHING OF PERMANENT LITERARY VALUE GIDEON IS SURELY ENTITLED

THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN AND HIS WATER LOTS
BY GEORGE POPE MORRIS 1802 1864
FROM THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN AND HIS WATER LOTS WITH OTHER SKETCHES OF
THE TIMES 1839 BY GEORGE POPE MORRIS
LOOK INTO THOSE THEY CALL UNFORTUNATE
AND CLOSER VIEW'D YOU'LL FIND THEY ARE UNWISE YOUNG
LET WEALTH COME IN BY COMELY THRIFT
AND NOT BY ANY FOOLISH SHIFT
TIS HASTE
MAKES WASTE
WHO GRIPES TOO HARD THE DRY AND SLIPPERY SAND
HOLDS NONE AT ALL OR LITTLE IN HIS HAND HERRICK
LET WELL ALONE PROVERB
HOW MUCH REAL COMFORT EVERY ONE MIGHT ENJOY IF HE WOULD BE CONTENTED
WITH THE LOT IN WHICH HEAVEN HAS CAST HIM AND HOW MUCH TROUBLE WOULD
BE AVOIDED IF PEOPLE WOULD ONLY LET WELL ALONE A MODERATE
INDEPENDENCE QUIETLY AND HONESTLY PROCURED IS CERTAINLY EVERY WAY
PREFERABLE EVEN TO IMMENSE POSSESSIONS ACHIEVED BY THE WEAR AND TEAR
OF MIND AND BODY SO NECESSARY TO PROCURE THEM
YET THERE ARE VERY FEW
INDIVIDUALS LET THEM BE DOING EVER SO WELL IN THE WORLD WHO ARE NOT
ALWAYS STRAINING EVERY NERVE TO DO BETTER AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY
CAUSES WHY FAILURES IN BUSINESS SO FREQUENTLY OCCUR AMONG US
THE
PRESENT GENERATION SEEM UNWILLING TO REALIZE BY SLOW AND SURE
DEGREES BUT CHOOSE RATHER TO SET THEIR WHOLE HOPES UPON A SINGLE
CAST WHICH EITHER MAKES OR MARS THEM FOREVER
GENTLE READER DO YOU REMEMBER MONSIEUR POOPOO HE USED TO KEEP A
SMALL TOY STORE IN CHATHAM NEAR THE CORNER OF PEARL STREET
YOU MUST
RECOLLECT HIM OF COURSE
HE LIVED THERE FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS ONE
OF THE MOST POLITE AND ACCOMMODATING OF SHOPKEEPERS
WHEN A JUVENILE
YOU HAVE BOUGHT TOPS AND MARBLES OF HIM A THOUSAND TIMES
TO BE SURE
YOU HAVE AND SEEN HIS VINEGAR VISAGE LIGHTED UP WITH A SMILE AS YOU
FLUNG HIM THE COPPERS AND YOU HAVE LAUGHED AT HIS LITTLE STRAIGHT
QUEUE AND HIS DIMITY BREECHES AND ALL THE OTHER ODDITIES THAT MADE UP
THE EVERY DAY APPAREL OF MY LITTLE FRENCHMAN
AH I PERCEIVE YOU
RECOLLECT HIM NOW
WELL THEN THERE LIVED MONSIEUR POOPOO EVER SINCE HE CAME FROM DEAR
DELIGHTFUL PARIS AS HE WAS WONT TO CALL THE CITY OF HIS
NATIVITY THERE HE TOOK IN THE PENNIES FOR HIS KICKSHAWS THERE HE
LAID ASIDE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AGAINST A RAINY DAY THERE HE WAS AS
HAPPY AS A LARK AND THERE IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN TO THIS VERY DAY A RESPECTED AND SUBSTANTIAL CITIZEN HAD HE
BEEN WILLING TO LET WELL ALONE BUT MONSIEUR POOPOO HAD HEARD
STRANGE STORIES ABOUT THE PRODIGIOUS RISE IN REAL ESTATE AND HAVING
UNDERSTOOD THAT MOST OF HIS NEIGHBORS HAD BECOME SUDDENLY RICH BY
SPECULATING IN LOTS HE INSTANTLY GREW DISSATISFIED WITH HIS OWN LOT
FORTHWITH DETERMINED TO SHUT UP SHOP TURN EVERYTHING INTO CASH AND
SET ABOUT MAKING MONEY IN RIGHT DOWN EARNEST
NO SOONER SAID THAN
DONE AND OUR QUONDAM STOREKEEPER A FEW DAYS AFTERWARD ATTENDED AN
EXTENSIVE SALE OF REAL ESTATE AT THE MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE
THERE WAS THE AUCTIONEER WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL AND INVITING LITHOGRAPHIC
MAPS ALL THE LOTS AS SMOOTH AND SQUARE AND ENTICINGLY LAID OUT AS
POSSIBLE AND THERE WERE THE SPECULATORS AND THERE IN THE MIDST OF
THEM STOOD MONSIEUR POOPOO
HERE THEY ARE GENTLEMEN SAID HE OF THE HAMMER THE MOST VALUABLE
LOTS EVER OFFERED FOR SALE
GIVE ME A BID FOR THEM
ONE HUNDRED EACH SAID A BYSTANDER
ONE HUNDRED SAID THE AUCTIONEER SCARCELY ENOUGH TO PAY FOR THE
MAPS
ONE HUNDRED GOING AND FIFTY GONE MR
H THEY ARE YOURS
A
NOBLE PURCHASE
YOU'LL SELL THOSE SAME LOTS IN LESS THAN A FORTNIGHT
FOR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PROFIT
MONSIEUR POOPOO PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT THIS AND WAS LOST IN
ASTONISHMENT
THIS WAS A MUCH EASIER WAY CERTAINLY OF ACCUMULATING
RICHES THAN SELLING TOYS IN CHATHAM STREET AND HE DETERMINED TO BUY
AND MEND HIS FORTUNE WITHOUT DELAY
THE AUCTIONEER PROCEEDED IN HIS SALE
OTHER PARCELS WERE OFFERED AND
DISPOSED OF AND ALL THE PURCHASERS WERE PROMISED IMMENSE ADVANTAGES
FOR THEIR ENTERPRISE
AT LAST CAME A MORE VALUABLE PARCEL THAN ALL THE
REST
THE COMPANY PRESSED AROUND THE STAND AND MONSIEUR POOPOO DID
THE SAME
I NOW OFFER YOU GENTLEMEN THESE MAGNIFICENT LOTS DELIGHTFULLY
SITUATED ON LONG ISLAND WITH VALUABLE WATER PRIVILEGES
PROPERTY IN
FEE TITLE INDISPUTABLE TERMS OF SALE CASH DEEDS READY FOR DELIVERY
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SALE
HOW MUCH FOR THEM GIVE THEM A START AT
SOMETHING
HOW MUCH THE AUCTIONEER LOOKED AROUND THERE WERE NO
BIDDERS
AT LAST HE CAUGHT THE EYE OF MONSIEUR POOPOO

SAY ONE HUNDRED FOR YOU
OUI MONSIEUR I WILL GIVE YOU VON HUNDRED DOLLAR APIECE FOR DE

MONSIEUR POOPOO WAS THE FORTUNATE POSSESSOR
THE AUCTIONEER
CONGRATULATED HIM THE SALE CLOSED AND THE COMPANY DISPERSED
PARDONNEZ MOI MONSIEUR SAID POOPOO AS THE AUCTIONEER DESCENDED

CERTAINLY SIR
VELL DEN ALLONS
AND THE GENTLEMEN REPAIRED TO THE COUNTING HOUSE WHERE THE SIX
THOUSAND DOLLARS WERE PAID AND THE DEEDS OF THE PROPERTY DELIVERED
MONSIEUR POOPOO PUT THESE CAREFULLY IN HIS POCKET AND AS HE WAS ABOUT
TAKING HIS LEAVE THE AUCTIONEER MADE HIM A PRESENT OF THE
LITHOGRAPHIC OUTLINE OF THE LOTS WHICH WAS A VERY LIBERAL THING ON
HIS PART CONSIDERING THE MAP WAS A BEAUTIFUL SPECIMEN OF THAT
GLORIOUS ART
POOPOO COULD NOT ADMIRE IT SUFFICIENTLY
THERE WERE HIS
SIXTY LOTS AS UNIFORM AS POSSIBLE AND HIS LITTLE GRAY EYES SPARKLED
LIKE DIAMONDS AS THEY WANDERED FROM ONE END OF THE SPACIOUS SHEET TO
THE OTHER
POOPOO'S HEART WAS AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER AND HE SNAPPED HIS FINGERS
IN THE VERY WANTONNESS OF JOY AS HE REPAIRED TO DELMONICO'S AND
ORDERED THE FIRST GOOD FRENCH DINNER THAT HAD GLADDENED HIS PALATE
SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN AMERICA
AFTER HAVING DISCUSSED HIS REPAST AND WASHED IT DOWN WITH A BOTTLE OF
CHOICE OLD CLARET HE RESOLVED UPON A VISIT TO LONG ISLAND TO VIEW HIS
PURCHASE
HE CONSEQUENTLY IMMEDIATELY HIRED A HORSE AND GIG CROSSED
THE BROOKLYN FERRY AND DROVE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE RIVER TO THE
WALLABOUT THE LOCATION IN QUESTION
OUR FRIEND HOWEVER WAS NOT A LITTLE PERPLEXED TO FIND HIS PROPERTY
EVERYTHING ON THE MAP WAS AS FAIR AND EVEN AS POSSIBLE WHILE ALL THE
GROUNDS ABOUT HIM WERE AS UNDULATED AS THEY COULD WELL BE IMAGINED
AND THERE WAS AN ELBOW OF THE EAST RIVER THRUSTING ITSELF QUITE INTO
THE RIBS OF THE LAND WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE NO BUSINESS THERE
THIS
PUZZLED THE FRENCHMAN EXCEEDINGLY AND BEING A STRANGER IN THOSE
PARTS HE CALLED TO A FARMER IN AN ADJACENT FIELD
MON AMI ARE YOU ACQUAINT VID DIS PART OF DE COUNTRY EH
YES I WAS BORN HERE AND KNOW EVERY INCH OF IT
AH C'EST BIEN DAT VILL DO AND THE FRENCHMAN GOT OUT OF THE GIG
TIED THE HORSE AND PRODUCED HIS LITHOGRAPHIC MAP
DEN MAYBE YOU VILL HAVE DE KINDNESS TO SHOW ME DE SIXTY LOT VICH I
HAVE BOUGHT VID DE VALUARBLE VATARE PRIVALEGE
THE FARMER GLANCED HIS EYE OVER THE PAPER
YES SIR WITH PLEASURE IF YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO GET INTO MY
BOAT I WILL ROW YOU OUT TO THEM
VAT DAT YOU SAY SURE
MY FRIEND SAID THE FARMER THIS SECTION OF LONG ISLAND HAS
RECENTLY BEEN BOUGHT UP BY THE SPECULATORS OF NEW YORK AND LAID OUT
FOR A GREAT CITY BUT THE PRINCIPAL STREET IS ONLY VISIBLE AT LOW
TIDE
WHEN THIS PART OF THE EAST RIVER IS FILLED UP IT WILL BE JUST
THERE
YOUR LOTS AS YOU WILL PERCEIVE ARE BEYOND IT AND ARE NOW
ALL UNDER WATER
AT FIRST THE FRENCHMAN WAS INCREDULOUS
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS
SENSES
AS THE FACTS HOWEVER GRADUALLY BROKE UPON HIM HE SHUT ONE
EYE SQUINTED OBLIQUELY AT THE HEAVENS THE RIVER THE FARMER AND
THEN HE TURNED AWAY AND SQUINTED AT THEM ALL OVER AGAIN THERE WAS HIS
PURCHASE SURE ENOUGH BUT THEN IT COULD NOT BE PERCEIVED FOR THERE WAS
A RIVER FLOWING OVER IT HE DREW A BOX FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
OPENED IT WITH AN EMPHATIC KNOCK UPON THE LID TOOK A PINCH OF SNUFF
AND RESTORED IT TO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET AS BEFORE
POOPOO WAS
EVIDENTLY IN TROUBLE HAVING THOUGHTS WHICH OFTEN LIE TOO DEEP FOR
TEARS AND AS HIS GRIEF WAS ALSO TOO BIG FOR WORDS HE UNTIED HIS
HORSE JUMPED INTO HIS GIG AND RETURNED TO THE AUCTIONEER IN HOT
HASTE
IT WAS NEAR NIGHT WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE AUCTION ROOM HIS HORSE IN A
FOAM AND HIMSELF IN A FURY
THE AUCTIONEER WAS LEANING BACK IN HIS
CHAIR WITH HIS LEGS STUCK OUT OF A LOW WINDOW QUIETLY SMOKING A
CIGAR AFTER THE LABORS OF THE DAY AND HUMMING THE MUSIC FROM THE LAST
NEW OPERA
MONSIEUR I HAVE MUCH PLAISIR TO FIN' YOU CHEZ VOUS AT HOME

LOTS STILL REMAIN UNDER WATER
THE ANGEL OF THE ODD
FROM THE COLUMBIAN MAGAZINE OCTOBER 1844
BY EDGAR ALLAN POE 1809 1849
IT WAS A CHILLY NOVEMBER AFTERNOON
I HAD JUST CONSUMMATED AN
UNUSUALLY HEARTY DINNER OF WHICH THE DYSPEPTIC TRUFFE FORMED NOT
THE LEAST IMPORTANT ITEM AND WAS SITTING ALONE IN THE DINING ROOM
WITH MY FEET UPON THE FENDER AND AT MY ELBOW A SMALL TABLE WHICH I HAD
ROLLED UP TO THE FIRE AND UPON WHICH WERE SOME APOLOGIES FOR DESSERT
WITH SOME MISCELLANEOUS BOTTLES OF WINE SPIRIT AND LIQUEUR
IN THE
MORNING I HAD BEEN READING GLOVER'S LEONIDAS WILKIE'S EPIGONIAD
LAMARTINE'S PILGRIMAGE BARLOW'S COLUMBIAD TUCKERMAN'S SICILY
AND GRISWOLD'S CURIOSITIES I AM WILLING TO CONFESS THEREFORE THAT
I NOW FELT A LITTLE STUPID
I MADE EFFORT TO AROUSE MYSELF BY FREQUENT
AID OF LAFITTE AND ALL FAILING I BETOOK MYSELF TO A STRAY NEWSPAPER
IN DESPAIR
HAVING CAREFULLY PERUSED THE COLUMN OF HOUSES TO LET
AND THE COLUMN OF DOGS LOST AND THEN THE COLUMNS OF WIVES AND
APPRENTICES RUNAWAY I ATTACKED WITH GREAT RESOLUTION THE EDITORIAL
MATTER AND READING IT FROM BEGINNING TO END WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING A
SYLLABLE CONCEIVED THE POSSIBILITY OF ITS BEING CHINESE AND SO
RE READ IT FROM THE END TO THE BEGINNING BUT WITH NO MORE
SATISFACTORY RESULT
I WAS ABOUT THROWING AWAY IN DISGUST
THIS FOLIO OF FOUR PAGES HAPPY WORK
WHICH NOT EVEN CRITICS CRITICISE
WHEN I FELT MY ATTENTION SOMEWHAT AROUSED BY THE PARAGRAPH WHICH
FOLLOWS
THE AVENUES TO DEATH ARE NUMEROUS AND STRANGE
A LONDON PAPER
MENTIONS THE DECEASE OF A PERSON FROM A SINGULAR CAUSE
HE WAS PLAYING
AT 'PUFF THE DART WHICH IS PLAYED WITH A LONG NEEDLE INSERTED IN
SOME WORSTED AND BLOWN AT A TARGET THROUGH A TIN TUBE
HE PLACED THE
NEEDLE AT THE WRONG END OF THE TUBE AND DRAWING HIS BREATH STRONGLY
TO PUFF THE DART FORWARD WITH FORCE DREW THE NEEDLE INTO HIS THROAT
IT ENTERED THE LUNGS AND IN A FEW DAYS KILLED HIM
UPON SEEING THIS I FELL INTO A GREAT RAGE WITHOUT EXACTLY KNOWING
WHY
THIS THING I EXCLAIMED IS A CONTEMPTIBLE FALSEHOOD A POOR
HOAX THE LEES OF THE INVENTION OF SOME PITIABLE PENNY A LINER OF
SOME WRETCHED CONCOCTER OF ACCIDENTS IN COCAIGNE
THESE FELLOWS
KNOWING THE EXTRAVAGANT GULLIBILITY OF THE AGE SET THEIR WITS TO WORK
IN THE IMAGINATION OF IMPROBABLE POSSIBILITIES OF ODD ACCIDENTS AS
THEY TERM THEM BUT TO A REFLECTING INTELLECT LIKE MINE I ADDED IN
PARENTHESIS PUTTING MY FOREFINGER UNCONSCIOUSLY TO THE SIDE OF MY
NOSE TO A CONTEMPLATIVE UNDERSTANDING SUCH AS I MYSELF POSSESS IT
SEEMS EVIDENT AT ONCE THAT THE MARVELOUS INCREASE OF LATE IN THESE
'ODD ACCIDENTS' IS BY FAR THE ODDEST ACCIDENT OF ALL
FOR MY OWN PART
I INTEND TO BELIEVE NOTHING HENCEFORWARD THAT HAS ANYTHING OF THE
'SINGULAR' ABOUT IT
MEIN GOTT DEN VAT A VOOL YOU BEES FOR DAT REPLIED ONE OF THE MOST
REMARKABLE VOICES I EVER HEARD
AT FIRST I TOOK IT FOR A RUMBLING IN
MY EARS SUCH AS A MAN SOMETIMES EXPERIENCES WHEN GETTING VERY
DRUNK BUT UPON SECOND THOUGHT I CONSIDERED THE SOUND AS MORE NEARLY
RESEMBLING THAT WHICH PROCEEDS FROM AN EMPTY BARREL BEATEN WITH A BIG
STICK AND IN FACT THIS I SHOULD HAVE CONCLUDED IT TO BE BUT FOR
THE ARTICULATION OF THE SYLLABLES AND WORDS
I AM BY NO MEANS
NATURALLY NERVOUS AND THE VERY FEW GLASSES OF LAFITTE WHICH I HAD
SIPPED SERVED TO EMBOLDEN ME A LITTLE SO THAT I FELT NOTHING OF
TREPIDATION BUT MERELY UPLIFTED MY EYES WITH A LEISURELY MOVEMENT AND
LOOKED CAREFULLY AROUND THE ROOM FOR THE INTRUDER
I COULD NOT
HOWEVER PERCEIVE ANY ONE AT ALL
HUMPH RESUMED THE VOICE AS I CONTINUED MY SURVEY YOU MUS PE SO
DRONK AS DE PIG DEN FOR NOT ZEE ME AS I ZIT HERE AT YOUR ZIDE
HEREUPON I BETHOUGHT ME OF LOOKING IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MY NOSE AND
THERE SURE ENOUGH CONFRONTING ME AT THE TABLE SAT A PERSONAGE
NONDESCRIPT ALTHOUGH NOT ALTOGETHER INDESCRIBABLE
HIS BODY WAS A
WINE PIPE OR A RUM PUNCHEON OR SOMETHING OF THAT CHARACTER AND HAD A
TRULY FALSTAFFIAN AIR
IN ITS NETHER EXTREMITY WERE INSERTED TWO KEGS
WHICH SEEMED TO ANSWER ALL THE PURPOSES OF LEGS
FOR ARMS THERE
DANGLED FROM THE UPPER PORTION OF THE CARCASS TWO TOLERABLY LONG
BOTTLES WITH THE NECKS OUTWARD FOR HANDS
ALL THE HEAD THAT I SAW THE
MONSTER POSSESSED OF WAS ONE OF THOSE HESSIAN CANTEENS WHICH RESEMBLE
A LARGE SNUFF BOX WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LID
THIS CANTEEN
WITH A FUNNEL ON ITS TOP LIKE A CAVALIER CAP SLOUCHED OVER THE EYES
WAS SET ON EDGE UPON THE PUNCHEON WITH THE HOLE TOWARD MYSELF AND
THROUGH THIS HOLE WHICH SEEMED PUCKERED UP LIKE THE MOUTH OF A VERY
PRECISE OLD MAID THE CREATURE WAS EMITTING CERTAIN RUMBLING AND
GRUMBLING NOISES WHICH HE EVIDENTLY INTENDED FOR INTELLIGIBLE TALK
I ZAY SAID HE YOU MOS PE DRONK AS DE PIG VOR ZIT DARE AND NOT
ZEE ME ZIT ERE AND I ZAY DOO YOU MOS PE PIGGER VOOL AS DE GOOSE
VOR TO DISPELIEF VAT IZ PRINT IN DE PRINT
'TIZ DE TROOF DAT IT
IZ EBERY VORD OB IT
WHO ARE YOU PRAY SAID I WITH MUCH DIGNITY ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT
PUZZLED HOW DID YOU GET HERE AND WHAT IS IT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
AS VOR OW I COM'D ERE REPLIED THE FIGURE DAT IZ NONE OF YOUR
PIZZINESS AND AS VOR VAT I BE TALKING APOUT I BE TALK APOUT VAT I
TINK PROPER AND AS VOR WHO I BE VY DAT IS DE VERY TING I COM'D HERE
FOR TO LET YOU ZEE FOR YOURSELF
YOU ARE A DRUNKEN VAGABOND SAID I AND I SHALL RING THE BELL AND
ORDER MY FOOTMAN TO KICK YOU INTO THE STREET
HE HE HE SAID THE FELLOW HU HU HU DAT YOU CAN'T DO
CAN'T DO SAID I WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T DO WHAT
RING DE PELL HE REPLIED ATTEMPTING A GRIN WITH HIS LITTLE
VILLAINOUS MOUTH
UPON THIS I MADE AN EFFORT TO GET UP IN ORDER TO PUT MY THREAT INTO
EXECUTION BUT THE RUFFIAN JUST REACHED ACROSS THE TABLE VERY
DELIBERATELY AND HITTING ME A TAP ON THE FOREHEAD WITH THE NECK OF
ONE OF THE LONG BOTTLES KNOCKED ME BACK INTO THE ARMCHAIR FROM WHICH
I HAD HALF ARISEN
I WAS UTTERLY ASTOUNDED AND FOR A MOMENT WAS QUITE
AT A LOSS WHAT TO DO
IN THE MEANTIME HE CONTINUED HIS TALK
YOU ZEE SAID HE IT IZ TE BESS VOR ZIT STILL AND NOW YOU SHALL
KNOW WHO I PE
LOOK AT ME ZEE I AM TE ANGEL OV TE ODD
AND ODD ENOUGH TOO I VENTURED TO REPLY BUT I WAS ALWAYS UNDER
THE IMPRESSION THAT AN ANGEL HAD WINGS
TE WING HE CRIED HIGHLY INCENSED VAT I PE DO MIT TE WING MEIN
GOTT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A SHICKEN
NO OH NO I REPLIED MUCH ALARMED YOU ARE NO CHICKEN CERTAINLY
NOT
WELL DEN ZIT STILL AND PEHABE YOURSELF OR I'LL RAP YOU AGAIN MID
ME VIST
IT IZ TE SHICKEN AB TE WING UND TE OWL AB TE WING UND TE
IMP AB TE WING UND TE HEAD TEUFFEL AB TE WING
TE ANGEL AB NOT TE
WING AND I AM TE ANGEL OV TE ODD
AND YOUR BUSINESS WITH ME AT PRESENT IS IS
MY PIZZINESS EJACULATED THE THING VY VAT A LOW BRED PUPPY YOU MOS
PE VOR TO ASK A GENTLEMAN UND AN ANGEL APOUT HIS PIZZINESS
THIS LANGUAGE WAS RATHER MORE THAN I COULD BEAR EVEN FROM AN ANGEL
SO PLUCKING UP COURAGE I SEIZED A SALT CELLAR WHICH LAY WITHIN
REACH AND HURLED IT AT THE HEAD OF THE INTRUDER
EITHER HE DODGED
HOWEVER OR MY AIM WAS INACCURATE FOR ALL I ACCOMPLISHED WAS THE
DEMOLITION OF THE CRYSTAL WHICH PROTECTED THE DIAL OF THE CLOCK UPON
THE MANTELPIECE
AS FOR THE ANGEL HE EVINCED HIS SENSE OF MY ASSAULT
BY GIVING ME TWO OR THREE HARD CONSECUTIVE RAPS UPON THE FOREHEAD AS
BEFORE
THESE REDUCED ME AT ONCE TO SUBMISSION AND I AM ALMOST
ASHAMED TO CONFESS THAT EITHER THROUGH PAIN OR VEXATION THERE CAME A
FEW TEARS INTO MY EYES
MEIN GOTT SAID THE ANGEL OF THE ODD APPARENTLY MUCH SOFTENED AT MY
DISTRESS MEIN GOTT TE MAN IS EDER FERRY DRONK OR FERRY ZORRY
YOU
MOS NOT TRINK IT SO STRONG YOU MOS PUT TE WATER IN TE WINE
HERE
TRINK DIS LIKE A GOOD VELLER AND DON'T GRY NOW DON'T
HEREUPON THE ANGEL OF THE ODD REPLENISHED MY GOBLET WHICH WAS ABOUT A
THIRD FULL OF PORT WITH A COLORLESS FLUID THAT HE POURED FROM ONE OF
HIS HAND BOTTLES
I OBSERVED THAT THESE BOTTLES HAD LABELS ABOUT THEIR
NECKS AND THAT THESE LABELS WERE INSCRIBED KIRSCHENWSSER
THE CONSIDERATE KINDNESS OF THE ANGEL MOLLIFIED ME IN NO LITTLE
MEASURE AND AIDED BY THE WATER WITH WHICH HE DILUTED MY PORT MORE
THAN ONCE I AT LENGTH REGAINED SUFFICIENT TEMPER TO LISTEN TO HIS
VERY EXTRAORDINARY DISCOURSE
I CANNOT PRETEND TO RECOUNT ALL THAT HE
TOLD ME BUT I GLEANED FROM WHAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS A GENIUS WHO
PRESIDED OVER THE CONTRETEMPS OF MANKIND AND WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS
TO BRING ABOUT THE ODD ACCIDENTS WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY ASTONISHING
THE SKEPTIC
ONCE OR TWICE UPON MY VENTURING TO EXPRESS MY TOTAL
INCREDULITY IN RESPECT TO HIS PRETENSIONS HE GREW VERY ANGRY INDEED
SO THAT AT LENGTH I CONSIDERED IT THE WISER POLICY TO SAY NOTHING AT
ALL AND LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY
HE TALKED ON THEREFORE AT GREAT
LENGTH WHILE I MERELY LEANED BACK IN MY CHAIR WITH MY EYES SHUT AND
AMUSED MYSELF WITH MUNCHING RAISINS AND FILIPING THE STEMS ABOUT THE
ROOM
BUT BY AND BY THE ANGEL SUDDENLY CONSTRUED THIS BEHAVIOR OF
MINE INTO CONTEMPT
HE AROSE IN A TERRIBLE PASSION SLOUCHED HIS
FUNNEL DOWN OVER HIS EYES SWORE A VAST OATH UTTERED A THREAT OF SOME
CHARACTER WHICH I DID NOT PRECISELY COMPREHEND AND FINALLY MADE ME A
LOW BOW AND DEPARTED WISHING ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ARCHBISHOP IN
GIL BIAS BEAUCOUP DE BONHEUR ET UN PEU PLUS DE BON SENS
HIS DEPARTURE AFFORDED ME RELIEF
THE VERY FEW GLASSES OF LAFITTE
THAT I HAD SIPPED HAD THE EFFECT OF RENDERING ME DROWSY AND I FELT
INCLINED TO TAKE A NAP OF SOME FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MINUTES AS IS MY
CUSTOM AFTER DINNER
AT SIX I HAD AN APPOINTMENT OF CONSEQUENCE WHICH
IT WAS QUITE INDISPENSABLE THAT I SHOULD KEEP
THE POLICY OF INSURANCE
FOR MY DWELLING HOUSE HAD EXPIRED THE DAY BEFORE AND SOME DISPUTE
HAVING ARISEN IT WAS AGREED THAT AT SIX I SHOULD MEET THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY AND SETTLE THE TERMS OF A RENEWAL
GLANCING
UPWARD AT THE CLOCK ON THE MANTELPIECE FOR I FELT TOO DROWSY TO TAKE
OUT MY WATCH I HAD THE PLEASURE TO FIND THAT I HAD STILL TWENTY FIVE
MINUTES TO SPARE
IT WAS HALF PAST FIVE I COULD EASILY WALK TO THE
INSURANCE OFFICE IN FIVE MINUTES AND MY USUAL SIESTAS HAD NEVER BEEN
KNOWN TO EXCEED FIVE AND TWENTY
I FELT SUFFICIENTLY SAFE THEREFORE
AND COMPOSED MYSELF TO MY SLUMBERS FORTHWITH
HAVING COMPLETED THEM TO MY SATISFACTION I AGAIN LOOKED TOWARD THE
TIMEPIECE AND WAS HALF INCLINED TO BELIEVE IN THE POSSIBILITY OF ODD
ACCIDENTS WHEN I FOUND THAT INSTEAD OF MY ORDINARY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY
MINUTES I HAD BEEN DOZING ONLY THREE FOR IT STILL WANTED
SEVEN AND TWENTY OF THE APPOINTED HOUR
I BETOOK MYSELF AGAIN TO MY
NAP AND AT LENGTH A SECOND TIME AWOKE WHEN TO MY UTTER AMAZEMENT
IT STILL WANTED TWENTY SEVEN MINUTES OF SIX
I JUMPED UP TO EXAMINE
THE CLOCK AND FOUND THAT IT HAD CEASED RUNNING
MY WATCH INFORMED ME
THAT IT WAS HALF PAST SEVEN AND OF COURSE HAVING SLEPT TWO HOURS I
WAS TOO LATE FOR MY APPOINTMENT
IT WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE I SAID
I CAN CALL AT THE OFFICE IN THE MORNING AND APOLOGIZE IN THE
MEANTIME WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER WITH THE CLOCK UPON EXAMINING IT I
DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE RAISIN STEMS WHICH I HAD BEEN FILIPING
ABOUT THE ROOM DURING THE DISCOURSE OF THE ANGEL OF THE ODD HAD FLOWN
THROUGH THE FRACTURED CRYSTAL AND LODGING SINGULARLY ENOUGH IN THE
KEYHOLE WITH AN END PROJECTING OUTWARD HAD THUS ARRESTED THE
REVOLUTION OF THE MINUTE HAND
AH SAID I I SEE HOW IT IS
THIS THING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
A
NATURAL ACCIDENT SUCH AS WILL HAPPEN NOW AND THEN
I GAVE THE MATTER NO FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND AT MY USUAL HOUR
RETIRED TO BED
HERE HAVING PLACED A CANDLE UPON A READING STAND AT
THE BED HEAD AND HAVING MADE AN ATTEMPT TO PERUSE SOME PAGES OF THE
OMNIPRESENCE OF THE DEITY I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP IN LESS THAN
TWENTY SECONDS LEAVING THE LIGHT BURNING AS IT WAS
MY DREAMS WERE TERRIFICALLY DISTURBED BY VISIONS OF THE ANGEL OF THE
ODD
METHOUGHT HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE COUCH DREW ASIDE THE
CURTAINS AND IN THE HOLLOW DETESTABLE TONES OF A RUM PUNCHEON
MENACED ME WITH THE BITTEREST VENGEANCE FOR THE CONTEMPT WITH WHICH I
HAD TREATED HIM
HE CONCLUDED A LONG HARANGUE BY TAKING OFF HIS
FUNNEL CAP INSERTING THE TUBE INTO MY GULLET AND THUS DELUGING ME
WITH AN OCEAN OF KIRSCHENWSSER WHICH HE POURED IN A CONTINUOUS
FLOOD FROM ONE OF THE LONG NECKED BOTTLES THAT STOOD HIM INSTEAD OF
AN ARM
MY AGONY WAS AT LENGTH INSUFFERABLE AND I AWOKE JUST IN TIME
TO PERCEIVE THAT A RAT HAD RUN OFF WITH THE LIGHTED CANDLE FROM THE
STAND BUT NOT IN SEASON TO PREVENT HIS MAKING HIS ESCAPE WITH IT
THROUGH THE HOLE VERY SOON A STRONG SUFFOCATING ODOR ASSAILED MY
NOSTRILS THE HOUSE I CLEARLY PERCEIVED WAS ON FIRE
IN A FEW
MINUTES THE BLAZE BROKE FORTH WITH VIOLENCE AND IN AN INCREDIBLY
BRIEF PERIOD THE ENTIRE BUILDING WAS WRAPPED IN FLAMES
ALL EGRESS
FROM MY CHAMBER EXCEPT THROUGH A WINDOW WAS CUT OFF
THE CROWD
HOWEVER QUICKLY PROCURED AND RAISED A LONG LADDER
BY MEANS OF THIS I
WAS DESCENDING RAPIDLY AND IN APPARENT SAFETY WHEN A HUGE HOG ABOUT
WHOSE ROTUND STOMACH AND INDEED ABOUT WHOSE WHOLE AIR AND
PHYSIOGNOMY THERE WAS SOMETHING WHICH REMINDED ME OF THE ANGEL OF THE
ODD WHEN THIS HOG I SAY WHICH HITHERTO HAD BEEN QUIETLY SLUMBERING
IN THE MUD TOOK IT SUDDENLY INTO HIS HEAD THAT HIS LEFT SHOULDER
NEEDED SCRATCHING AND COULD FIND NO MORE CONVENIENT RUBBING POST THAN
THAT AFFORDED BY THE FOOT OF THE LADDER
IN AN INSTANT I WAS
PRECIPITATED AND HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO FRACTURE MY ARM
THIS ACCIDENT WITH THE LOSS OF MY INSURANCE AND WITH THE MORE
SERIOUS LOSS OF MY HAIR THE WHOLE OF WHICH HAD BEEN SINGED OFF BY THE
FIRE PREDISPOSED ME TO SERIOUS IMPRESSIONS SO THAT FINALLY I MADE UP
MY MIND TO TAKE A WIFE
THERE WAS A RICH WIDOW DISCONSOLATE FOR THE
LOSS OF HER SEVENTH HUSBAND AND TO HER WOUNDED SPIRIT I OFFERED THE
BALM OF MY VOWS
SHE YIELDED A RELUCTANT CONSENT TO MY PRAYERS
I
KNELT AT HER FEET IN GRATITUDE AND ADORATION
SHE BLUSHED AND BOWED
HER LUXURIANT TRESSES INTO CLOSE CONTACT WITH THOSE SUPPLIED ME
TEMPORARILY BY GRANDJEAN
I KNOW NOT HOW THE ENTANGLEMENT TOOK PLACE
BUT SO IT WAS
I AROSE WITH A SHINING PATE WIGLESS SHE IN DISDAIN
AND WRATH HALF BURIED IN ALIEN HAIR
THUS ENDED MY HOPES OF THE WIDOW
BY AN ACCIDENT WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED TO BE SURE BUT
WHICH THE NATURAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS HAD BROUGHT ABOUT
WITHOUT DESPAIRING HOWEVER I UNDERTOOK THE SIEGE OF A LESS
IMPLACABLE HEART
THE FATES WERE AGAIN PROPITIOUS FOR A BRIEF PERIOD
BUT AGAIN A TRIVIAL INCIDENT INTERFERED
MEETING MY BETROTHED IN AN
AVENUE THRONGED WITH THE ELITE OF THE CITY I WAS HASTENING TO GREET
HER WITH ONE OF MY BEST CONSIDERED BOWS WHEN A SMALL PARTICLE OF SOME
FOREIGN MATTER LODGING IN THE CORNER OF MY EYE RENDERED ME FOR THE
MOMENT COMPLETELY BLIND
BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MY SIGHT THE LADY OF
MY LOVE HAD DISAPPEARED IRREPARABLY AFFRONTED AT WHAT SHE CHOSE TO
CONSIDER MY PREMEDITATED RUDENESS IN PASSING HER BY UNGREETED
WHILE I
STOOD BEWILDERED AT THE SUDDENNESS OF THIS ACCIDENT WHICH MIGHT HAVE
HAPPENED NEVERTHELESS TO ANY ONE UNDER THE SUN AND WHILE I STILL
CONTINUED INCAPABLE OF SIGHT I WAS ACCOSTED BY THE ANGEL OF THE ODD
WHO PROFFERED ME HIS AID WITH A CIVILITY WHICH I HAD NO REASON TO
EXPECT
HE EXAMINED MY DISORDERED EYE WITH MUCH GENTLENESS AND SKILL
INFORMED ME THAT I HAD A DROP IN IT AND WHATEVER A DROP WAS TOOK
IT OUT AND AFFORDED ME RELIEF
I NOW CONSIDERED IT HIGH TIME TO DIE SINCE FORTUNE HAD SO DETERMINED
TO PERSECUTE ME AND ACCORDINGLY MADE MY WAY TO THE NEAREST RIVER
HERE DIVESTING MYSELF OF MY CLOTHES FOR THERE IS NO REASON WHY WE
CANNOT DIE AS WE WERE BORN I THREW MYSELF HEADLONG INTO THE CURRENT
THE SOLE WITNESS OF MY FATE BEING A SOLITARY CROW THAT HAD BEEN
SEDUCED INTO THE EATING OF BRANDY SATURATED CORN AND SO HAD STAGGERED
AWAY FROM HIS FELLOWS
NO SOONER HAD I ENTERED THE WATER THAN THIS
BIRD TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD TO FLY AWAY WITH THE MOST INDISPENSABLE
PORTION OF MY APPAREL
POSTPONING THEREFORE FOR THE PRESENT MY
SUICIDAL DESIGN I JUST SLIPPED MY NETHER EXTREMITIES INTO THE SLEEVES
OF MY COAT AND BETOOK MYSELF TO A PURSUIT OF THE FELON WITH ALL THE
NIMBLENESS WHICH THE CASE REQUIRED AND ITS CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD ADMIT
BUT MY EVIL DESTINY ATTENDED ME STILL
AS I RAN AT FULL SPEED WITH MY
NOSE UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND INTENT ONLY UPON THE PURLOINER OF MY
PROPERTY I SUDDENLY PERCEIVED THAT MY FEET RESTED NO LONGER UPON
TERRA FIRMA THE FACT IS I HAD THROWN MYSELF OVER A PRECIPICE AND
SHOULD INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN DASHED TO PIECES BUT FOR MY GOOD FORTUNE
IN GRASPING THE END OF A LONG GUIDE ROPE WHICH DEPENDED FROM A
PASSING BALLOON
AS SOON AS I SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED MY SENSES TO COMPREHEND THE
TERRIFIC PREDICAMENT IN WHICH I STOOD OR RATHER HUNG I EXERTED ALL
THE POWER OF MY LUNGS TO MAKE THAT PREDICAMENT KNOWN TO THE AERONAUT
OVERHEAD
BUT FOR A LONG TIME I EXERTED MYSELF IN VAIN
EITHER THE
FOOL COULD NOT OR THE VILLAIN WOULD NOT PERCEIVE ME
MEANWHILE THE
MACHINE RAPIDLY SOARED WHILE MY STRENGTH EVEN MORE RAPIDLY FAILED
I
WAS SOON UPON THE POINT OF RESIGNING MYSELF TO MY FATE AND DROPPING
QUIETLY INTO THE SEA WHEN MY SPIRITS WERE SUDDENLY REVIVED BY HEARING
A HOLLOW VOICE FROM ABOVE WHICH SEEMED TO BE LAZILY HUMMING AN OPERA
AIR
LOOKING UP I PERCEIVED THE ANGEL OF THE ODD
HE WAS LEANING
WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED OVER THE RIM OF THE CAR AND WITH A PIPE IN HIS
MOUTH AT WHICH HE PUFFED LEISURELY SEEMED TO BE UPON EXCELLENT TERMS
WITH HIMSELF AND THE UNIVERSE
I WAS TOO MUCH EXHAUSTED TO SPEAK SO I
MERELY REGARDED HIM WITH AN IMPLORING AIR
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ALTHOUGH HE LOOKED ME FULL IN THE FACE HE SAID
NOTHING
AT LENGTH REMOVING CAREFULLY HIS MEERSCHAUM FROM THE RIGHT
TO THE LEFT CORNER OF HIS MOUTH HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEAK
WHO PE YOU HE ASKED UND WHAT DER TEUFFEL YOU PE DO DARE
TO THIS PIECE OF IMPUDENCE CRUELTY AND AFFECTATION I COULD REPLY
ONLY BY EJACULATING THE MONOSYLLABLE HELP
ELP ECHOED THE RUFFIAN NOT I
DARE IZ TE POTTLE ELP YOURSELF
UND PE TAM'D
WITH THESE WORDS HE LET FALL A HEAVY BOTTLE OF KIRSCHENWSSER WHICH
DROPPING PRECISELY UPON THE CROWN OF MY HEAD CAUSED ME TO IMAGINE
THAT MY BRAINS WERE ENTIRELY KNOCKED OUT
IMPRESSED WITH THIS IDEA I
WAS ABOUT TO RELINQUISH MY HOLD AND GIVE UP THE GHOST WITH A GOOD
GRACE WHEN I WAS ARRESTED BY THE CRY OF THE ANGEL WHO BADE ME HOLD
ON
'OLD ON HE SAID DON'T PE IN TE 'URRY DON'T
WILL YOU PE TAKE DE
ODDER POTTLE OR 'AVE YOU PE GOT ZOBER YET AND COME TO YOUR ZENZES
I MADE HASTE HEREUPON TO NOD MY HEAD TWICE ONCE IN THE NEGATIVE
MEANING THEREBY THAT I WOULD PREFER NOT TAKING THE OTHER BOTTLE AT
PRESENT AND ONCE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE INTENDING THUS TO IMPLY THAT I
WAS SOBER AND HAD POSITIVELY COME TO MY SENSES
BY THESE MEANS I
SOMEWHAT SOFTENED THE ANGEL
UND YOU PELIEF TEN HE INQUIRED AT TE LAST YOU PELIEF TEN IN
TE POSSIBILITY OF TE ODD
I AGAIN NODDED MY HEAD IN ASSENT
UND YOU AVE PELIEF IN ME TE ANGEL OF TE ODD
I NODDED AGAIN
UND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE TAT YOU PE TE BLIND DRONK UND TE VOOL
I NODDED ONCE MORE
PUT YOUR RIGHT HAND INTO YOUR LEFT PREECHES POCKET TEN IN TOKEN OV
YOUR VULL ZUBMIZZION UNTO TE ANGEL OV TE ODD
THIS THING FOR VERY OBVIOUS REASONS I FOUND IT QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO
DO
IN THE FIRST PLACE MY LEFT ARM HAD BEEN BROKEN IN MY FALL FROM
THE LADDER AND THEREFORE HAD I LET GO MY HOLD WITH THE RIGHT HAND I
MUST HAVE LET GO ALTOGETHER
IN THE SECOND PLACE I COULD HAVE NO
BREECHES UNTIL I CAME ACROSS THE CROW
I WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED MUCH
TO MY REGRET TO SHAKE MY HEAD IN THE NEGATIVE INTENDING THUS TO GIVE
THE ANGEL TO UNDERSTAND THAT I FOUND IT INCONVENIENT JUST AT THAT
MOMENT TO COMPLY WITH HIS VERY REASONABLE DEMAND NO SOONER HOWEVER
HAD I CEASED SHAKING MY HEAD THAN
GO TO DER TEUFFEL TEN ROARED THE ANGEL OF THE ODD
IN PRONOUNCING THESE WORDS HE DREW A SHARP KNIFE ACROSS THE GUIDE ROPE
BY WHICH I WAS SUSPENDED AND AS WE THEN HAPPENED TO BE PRECISELY OVER
MY OWN HOUSE WHICH DURING MY PEREGRINATIONS HAD BEEN HANDSOMELY
REBUILT IT SO OCCURRED THAT I TUMBLED HEADLONG DOWN THE AMPLE
CHIMNEY AND ALIT UPON THE DINING ROOM HEARTH
UPON COMING TO MY SENSES FOR THE FALL HAD VERY THOROUGHLY STUNNED ME
I FOUND IT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I LAY OUTSTRETCHED WHERE
I HAD FALLEN FROM THE BALLOON
MY HEAD GROVELED IN THE ASHES OF AN
EXTINGUISHED FIRE WHILE MY FEET REPOSED UPON THE WRECK OF A SMALL
TABLE OVERTHROWN AND AMID THE FRAGMENTS OF A MISCELLANEOUS DESSERT
INTERMINGLED WITH A NEWSPAPER SOME BROKEN GLASSES AND SHATTERED
BOTTLES AND AN EMPTY JUG OF THE SCHIEDAM KIRSCHENWSSER
THUS
REVENGED HIMSELF THE ANGEL OF THE ODD
THE SCHOOLMASTER'S PROGRESS

KIRKLAND 1801 1864
FROM THE GIFT FOR 1845 PUBLISHED LATE IN 1844
REPUBLISHED IN THE
VOLUME WESTERN CLEARINGS 1845 BY CAROLINE M S
KIRKLAND
MASTER WILLIAM HORNER CAME TO OUR VILLAGE TO SCHOOL WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD TALL LANK STRAIGHT SIDED AND STRAIGHT HAIRED
WITH A MOUTH OF THE MOST PUCKERED AND SOLEMN KIND
HIS FIGURE AND
MOVEMENTS WERE THOSE OF A PUPPET CUT OUT OF SHINGLE AND JERKED BY A
STRING AND HIS ADDRESS CORRESPONDED VERY WELL WITH HIS APPEARANCE
NEVER DID THAT PRIM MOUTH GIVE WAY BEFORE A LAUGH
A FAINT AND MISTY
SMILE WAS THE WIDEST DEPARTURE FROM ITS PROPRIETY AND THIS
UNACCUSTOMED DISTURBANCE MADE WRINKLES IN THE FLAT SKINNY CHEEKS LIKE
THOSE IN THE SURFACE OF A LAKE AFTER THE INTRUSION OF A STONE
MASTER
HORNER KNEW WELL WHAT BELONGED TO THE PEDAGOGICAL CHARACTER AND THAT
FACIAL SOLEMNITY STOOD HIGH ON THE LIST OF INDISPENSABLE
QUALIFICATIONS
HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND BEFORE HE LEFT HIS FATHER'S
HOUSE HOW HE WOULD LOOK DURING THE TERM
HE HAD NOT PLANNED ANY SMILES
KNOWING THAT HE MUST BOARD ROUND AND IT WAS NOT FOR ORDINARY
OCCURRENCES TO ALTER HIS ARRANGEMENTS SO THAT WHEN HE WAS BETRAYED
INTO A RELAXATION OF THE MUSCLES IT WAS IN SUCH A SORT AS IF HE WAS
PUTTING HIS BREAD AND BUTTER IN JEOPARDY
TRULY HE HAD A GRAVE TIME THAT FIRST WINTER
THE ROD OF POWER WAS NEW
TO HIM AND HE FELT IT HIS DUTY TO USE IT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THOUGHT NECESSARY BY THOSE UPON WHOSE SENSE THE PRIVILEGE
HAD PALLED
TEARS AND SULKY FACES AND IMPOTENT FISTS DOUBLED FIERCELY
WHEN HIS BACK WAS TURNED WERE THE REWARDS OF HIS CONSCIENTIOUSNESS
AND THE BOYS AND GIRLS TOO WERE GLAD WHEN WORKING TIME CAME ROUND
AGAIN AND THE MASTER WENT HOME TO HELP HIS FATHER ON THE FARM
BUT WITH THE AUTUMN CAME MASTER HORNER AGAIN DROPPING AMONG US AS
QUIETLY AS THE FADED LEAVES AND AWAKENING AT LEAST AS MUCH SERIOUS
REFLECTION
WOULD HE BE AS SELF SACRIFICING AS BEFORE POSTPONING HIS
OWN EASE AND COMFORT TO THE PUBLIC GOOD OR WOULD HE HAVE BECOME MORE
SEDENTARY AND LESS FOND OF CIRCUMAMBULATING THE SCHOOL ROOM WITH A
SWITCH OVER HIS SHOULDER MANY WERE FAIN TO HOPE HE MIGHT HAVE LEARNED
TO SMOKE DURING THE SUMMER AN ACCOMPLISHMENT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE MODERATED HIS ENERGY NOT A LITTLE AND DISPOSED HIM RATHER TO
REVERIE THAN TO ACTION
BUT HERE HE WAS AND ALL THE BROADER CHESTED
AND STOUTER ARMED FOR HIS LABORS IN THE HARVEST FIELD
LET IT NOT BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER HORNER WAS OF A CRUEL AND OGRISH
NATURE A BABE EATER A HEROD ONE WHO DELIGHTED IN TORTURING THE
HELPLESS
SUCH SOULS THERE MAY BE AMONG THOSE ENDOWED WITH THE AWFUL
CONTROL OF THE FERULE BUT THEY ARE RARE IN THE FRESH AND NATURAL
REGIONS WE DESCRIBE
IT IS WE BELIEVE WHERE YOUNG GENTLEMEN ARE TO
BE CRAMMED FOR COLLEGE THAT THE PROCESS OF HARDENING HEART AND SKIN
TOGETHER GOES ON MOST VIGOROUSLY
YET AMONG THE UNEDUCATED THERE IS SO
HIGH A RESPECT FOR BODILY STRENGTH THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE
SCHOOLMASTER TO SHOW FIRST OF ALL THAT HE POSSESSES THIS
INADMISSIBLE REQUISITE FOR HIS PLACE
THE REST IS MORE READILY TAKEN
FOR GRANTED
BRAINS HE MAY HAVE A STRONG ARM HE MUST HAVE SO HE
PROVES THE MORE IMPORTANT CLAIM FIRST
WE MUST THEREFORE MAKE ALL DUE
ALLOWANCE FOR MASTER HORNER WHO COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO OVERTOP HIS
POSITION SO FAR AS TO DISCERN AT ONCE THE PHILOSOPHY OF TEACHING
HE WAS SADLY BROW BEATEN DURING HIS FIRST TERM OF SERVICE BY A GREAT
BROAD SHOULDERED LOUT OF SOME EIGHTEEN YEARS OR SO WHO THOUGHT HE
NEEDED A LITTLE MORE SCHOOLING BUT AT THE SAME TIME FELT QUITE
COMPETENT TO DIRECT THE MANNER AND MEASURE OF HIS ATTEMPTS
YOU'D OUGHT TO BEGIN WITH LARGE HAND JOSHUAY SAID MASTER HORNER TO
THIS YOUTH
WHAT SHOULD I WANT COARSE HAND FOR SAID THE DISCIPLE WITH GREAT
CONTEMPT COARSE HAND WON'T NEVER DO ME NO GOOD
I WANT A FINE HAND
COPY
THE MASTER LOOKED AT THE INFANT GIANT AND DID AS HE WISHED BUT WE
SAY NOT WITH WHAT SECRET RESOLUTIONS
AT ANOTHER TIME MASTER HORNER HAVING HAD A HINT FROM SOME ONE MORE
KNOWING THAN HIMSELF PROPOSED TO HIS ELDER SCHOLARS TO WRITE AFTER
DICTATION EXPATIATING AT THE SAME TIME QUITE FLORIDLY THE IDEAS
HAVING BEEN SUPPLIED BY THE KNOWING FRIEND UPON THE ADVANTAGES
LIKELY TO ARISE FROM THIS PRACTICE AND SAYING AMONG OTHER THINGS
IT WILL HELP YOU WHEN YOU WRITE LETTERS TO SPELL THE WORDS GOOD
POOH SAID JOSHUA SPELLIN' AIN'T NOTHIN' LET THEM THAT FINDS THE
MISTAKES CORRECT 'EM
I'M FOR EVERY ONE'S HAVIN' A WAY OF THEIR OWN
HOW DARED YOU BE SO SAUCY TO THE MASTER ASKED ONE OF THE LITTLE
BOYS AFTER SCHOOL
BECAUSE I COULD LICK HIM EASY SAID THE HOPEFUL JOSHUA WHO KNEW
VERY WELL WHY THE MASTER DID NOT UNDERTAKE HIM ON THE SPOT
CAN WE WONDER THAT MASTER HORNER DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS EMPIRE GOOD AS
FAR AS IT WENT
A NEW EXAMINATION WAS REQUIRED ON THE ENTRANCE INTO A SECOND TERM
AND WITH WHATEVER SECRET TREPIDATION THE MASTER WAS OBLIGED TO
SUBMIT
OUR LAW PRESCRIBES EXAMINATIONS BUT FORGETS TO PROVIDE FOR
THE COMPETENCY OF THE EXAMINERS SO THAT FEW BETTER FARCES OFFER THAN
THE COURSE OF QUESTION AND ANSWER ON THESE OCCASIONS
WE KNOW NOT
PRECISELY WHAT WERE MASTER HORNER'S TRIALS BUT WE HAVE HEARD OF A
SHARP DISPUTE BETWEEN THE INSPECTORS WHETHER A N G E L SPELT ANGLE
OR ANGEL
ANGLE HAD IT AND THE SCHOOL MAINTAINED THAT
PRONUNCIATION EVER AFTER
MASTER HORNER PASSED AND HE WAS REQUESTED
TO DRAW UP THE CERTIFICATE FOR THE INSPECTORS TO SIGN AS ONE HAD LEFT
HIS SPECTACLES AT HOME AND THE OTHER HAD A BAD COLD SO THAT IT WAS
NOT CONVENIENT FOR EITHER TO WRITE MORE THAN HIS NAME
MASTER HOMER'S
EXHIBITION OF LEARNING ON THIS OCCASION DID NOT REACH US BUT WE KNOW
THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLE SINCE HE STOOD THE ORDEAL
WHAT IS ORTHOGRAPHY SAID AN INSPECTOR ONCE IN OUR PRESENCE
THE CANDIDATE WRITHED A GOOD DEAL STUDIED THE BEAMS OVERHEAD AND THE
CHICKENS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEN REPLIED
IT IS SO LONG SINCE I LEARNT THE FIRST PART OF THE SPELLING BOOK
THAT I CAN'T JUSTLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION
BUT IF I COULD JUST LOOK IT
OVER I GUESS I COULD
OUR SCHOOLMASTER ENTERED UPON HIS SECOND TERM WITH NEW COURAGE AND
INVIGORATED AUTHORITY
TWICE CERTIFIED WHO SHOULD DARE DOUBT HIS
COMPETENCY EVEN JOSHUA WAS CIVIL AND LESSER LOUTS OF COURSE
OBSEQUIOUS THOUGH THE GIRLS TOOK MORE LIBERTIES FOR THEY FEEL EVEN
AT THAT EARLY AGE THAT INFLUENCE IS STRONGER THAN STRENGTH
COULD A YOUNG SCHOOLMASTER THINK OF FERULING A GIRL WITH HER HAIR IN
RINGLETS AND A GOLD RING ON HER FINGER IMPOSSIBLE AND THE IMMUNITY
EXTENDED TO ALL THE LITTLE SISTERS AND COUSINS AND THERE WERE ENOUGH
LARGE GIRLS TO PROTECT ALL THE FEMININE PART OF THE SCHOOL
WITH THE
BOYS MASTER HORNER STILL HAD MANY A BATTLE AND WHETHER WITH A VIEW TO
THIS OR AS AN ECONOMICAL RUSE HE NEVER WORE HIS COAT IN SCHOOL
SAYING IT WAS TOO WARM
PERHAPS IT WAS AN ASTUTE ATTENTION TO THE
PREJUDICES OF HIS EMPLOYERS WHO LOVE NO MAN THAT DOES NOT EARN HIS
LIVING BY THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW
THE SHIRT SLEEVES GAVE THE IDEA OF A
MANUAL LABOR SCHOOL IN ONE SENSE AT LEAST
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE
MASTER WORKED AND THAT AFFORDED A PROBABILITY THAT THE SCHOLARS
WORKED TOO
MASTER HORNER'S SUCCESS WAS MOST TRIUMPHANT THAT WINTER
A YEAR'S
GROWTH HAD IMPROVED HIS OUTWARD MAN EXCEEDINGLY FILLING OUT THE LIMBS
SO THAT THEY DID NOT REMIND YOU SO FORCIBLY OF A YOUNG COLT'S AND
SUPPLYING THE CHEEKS WITH THE FLESH AND BLOOD SO NECESSARY WHERE
MUSTACHES WERE NOT WORN
EXPERIENCE HAD GIVEN HIM A DEGREE OF
CONFIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE GAVE HIM POWER
IN SHORT PEOPLE SAID THE
MASTER HAD WAKED UP AND SO HE HAD
HE ACTUALLY SET ABOUT READING FOR
IMPROVEMENT AND ALTHOUGH AT THE END OF THE TERM HE COULD NOT QUITE
MAKE OUT FROM HIS HISTORICAL STUDIES WHICH SIDE HANNIBAL WAS ON YET
THIS IS READILY EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT HE BOARDED ROUND AND WAS
OBLIGED TO READ GENERALLY BY FIRELIGHT SURROUNDED BY UNGOVERNED
CHILDREN
AFTER THIS MASTER HORNER MADE HIS OWN BARGAIN
WHEN SCHOOLTIME CAME
ROUND WITH THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN AND THE TEACHER PRESENTED HIMSELF FOR
A THIRD EXAMINATION SUCH A TEST WAS PRONOUNCED NO LONGER NECESSARY
AND THE DISTRICT CONSENTED TO ENGAGE HIM AT THE ASTOUNDING RATE OF
SIXTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WAS TO HAVE A
FIXED HOME PROVIDED HE WAS WILLING TO ALLOW A DOLLAR A WEEK FOR IT
MASTER HORNER BETHOUGHT HIM OF THE SUCCESSIVE KILLING TIMES AND
CONSEQUENT DOUGHNUTS OF THE TWENTY FAMILIES IN WHICH HE HAD SOJOURNED
THE YEARS BEFORE AND CONSENTED TO THE EXACTION
BEHOLD OUR FRIEND NOW AS HIGH AS DISTRICT TEACHER CAN EVER HOPE TO
BE HIS SCHOLARSHIP ESTABLISHED HIS HOME STATIONARY AND NOT
REVOLVING AND THE GOOD BEHAVIOR OF THE COMMUNITY INSURED BY THE FACT
THAT HE BEING OF AGE HAD NOW A FARM TO RETIRE UPON IN CASE OF ANY
DISGUST
MASTER HORNER WAS AT ONCE THE PREMINENT BEAU OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SPITE OF THE PREJUDICE AGAINST LEARNING
HE BRUSHED HIS HAIR STRAIGHT
UP IN FRONT AND WORE A SKY BLUE RIBBON FOR A GUARD TO HIS SILVER
WATCH AND WALKED AS IF THE TALL HEELS OF HIS BLUNT BOOTS WERE
EGG SHELLS AND NOT LEATHER
YET HE WAS FAR FROM NEGLECTING THE DUTIES
OF HIS PLACE
HE WAS BEAU ONLY ON SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS VERY
SCHOOLMASTER THE REST OF THE TIME
IT WAS AT A SPELLING SCHOOL THAT MASTER HORNER FIRST MET THE
EDUCATED EYES OF MISS HARRIET BANGLE A YOUNG LADY VISITING THE
ENGLEHARTS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
SHE WAS FROM ONE OF THE TOWNS IN
WESTERN NEW YORK AND HAD BROUGHT WITH HER A VARIETY OF CITY AIRS AND
GRACES SOMEWHAT CARICATURED SET OFF WITH YEAR OLD FRENCH FASHIONS
MUCH TRAVESTIED
WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN SENT OUT TO THE NEW COUNTRY TO
TRY SOMEWHAT LATE A RUSTIC CHANCE FOR AN ESTABLISHMENT OR WHETHER
HER COMPANY HAD BEEN FOUND RATHER TRYING AT HOME WE CANNOT SAY
THE
VIEW WHICH SHE WAS AT SOME PAINS TO MAKE UNDERSTOOD WAS THAT HER
FRIENDS HAD CONTRIVED THIS METHOD OF KEEPING HER OUT OF THE WAY OF A
DESPERATE LOVER WHOSE ADDRESSES WERE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THEM
IF IT SHOULD SEEM SURPRISING THAT SO HIGH BRED A VISITOR SHOULD BE
SOJOURNING IN THE WILD WOODS IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT MORE THAN ONE
CELEBRATED ENGLISHMAN AND NOT A FEW DISTINGUISHED AMERICANS HAVE
FARMER BROTHERS IN THE WESTERN COUNTRY NO WHIT LESS RUSTIC IN THEIR
EXTERIOR AND MANNER OF LIFE THAN THE PLAINEST OF THEIR NEIGHBORS
WHEN
THESE ARE VISITED BY THEIR REFINED KINSFOLK WE OF THE WOODS CATCH
GLIMPSES OF THE GAY WORLD OR THINK WE DO
THAT GREAT MEDICINE HATH
WITH ITS TINCT GILDED
MANY A VULGARISM TO THE SATISFACTION OF WISER HEADS THAN OURS
MISS BANGLE'S MANNER BESPOKE FOR HER THAT HIGH CONSIDERATION WHICH SHE
FELT TO BE HER DUE
YET SHE CONDESCENDED TO BE AMUSED BY THE RUSTICS
AND THEIR AWKWARD ATTEMPTS AT GAIETY AND ELEGANCE AND TO SAY TRUTH
FEW OF THE VILLAGE MERRY MAKINGS ESCAPED HER THOUGH SHE WORE ALWAYS
THE AIR OF GREAT SUPERIORITY
THE SPELLING SCHOOL IS ONE OF THE ORDINARY WINTER AMUSEMENTS IN THE
COUNTRY
IT OCCURS ONCE IN A FORTNIGHT OR SO AND HAS POWER TO DRAW
OUT ALL THE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR MILES ROUND ARRAYED IN THEIR BEST
CLOTHES AND THEIR HOLIDAY BEHAVIOR
WHEN ALL IS READY UMPIRES ARE
ELECTED AND AFTER THESE HAVE TAKEN THE DISTINGUISHED PLACE USUALLY
OCCUPIED BY THE TEACHER THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE SCHOOL CHOOSE THE TWO
BEST SCHOLARS TO HEAD THE OPPOSING CLASSES
THESE LEADERS CHOOSE THEIR
FOLLOWERS FROM THE MASS EACH CALLING A NAME IN TURN UNTIL ALL THE
SPELLERS ARE RANKED ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER LINING THE SIDES OF THE
ROOM AND ALL STANDING
THE SCHOOLMASTER STANDING TOO TAKES HIS
SPELLING BOOK AND GIVES A PLACID YET AWE INSPIRING LOOK ALONG THE
RANKS REMARKING THAT HE INTENDS TO BE VERY IMPARTIAL AND THAT HE
SHALL GIVE OUT NOTHING THAT IS NOT IN THE SPELLING BOOK
FOR THE
FIRST HALF HOUR OR SO HE CHOOSES COMMON AND EASY WORDS THAT THE
SPIRIT OF THE EVENING MAY NOT BE DAMPED BY THE TOO EARLY THINNING OF
THE CLASSES
WHEN A WORD IS MISSED THE BLUNDERER HAS TO SIT DOWN AND
BE A SPECTATOR ONLY FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
AT CERTAIN INTERVALS
SOME OF THE BEST SPEAKERS MOUNT THE PLATFORM AND SPEAK A PIECE
WHICH IS GENERALLY AS DECLAMATORY AS POSSIBLE
THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS SCENE IS EQUAL TO THAT AFFORDED BY ANY CITY
SPECTACLE WHATEVER AND TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THE EVENING WHEN
DIFFICULT AND UNUSUAL WORDS ARE CHOSEN TO CONFOUND THE SMALL NUMBER
WHO STILL KEEP THE FLOOR IT BECOMES SCARCELY LESS THAN PAINFUL
WHEN
PERHAPS ONLY ONE OR TWO REMAIN TO BE PUZZLED THE MASTER WEARY AT
LAST OF HIS TASK THOUGH A FAVORITE ONE TRIES BY TRICKS TO PUT DOWN
THOSE WHOM HE CANNOT OVERCOME IN FAIR FIGHT
IF AMONG ALL THE CURIOUS
USELESS UNHEARD OF WORDS WHICH MAY BE PICKED OUT OF THE
SPELLING BOOK HE CANNOT FIND ONE WHICH THE SCHOLARS HAVE NOT NOTICED
HE GETS THE LAST HEAD DOWN BY SOME QUIP OR CATCH
BAY WILL PERHAPS
BE THE SOUND ONE SCHOLAR SPELLS IT BEY ANOTHER BAY WHILE THE
MASTER ALL THE TIME MEANS BA WHICH COMES WITHIN THE RULE BEING IN
THE SPELLING BOOK
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS AS WE HAVE SAID THAT MISS BANGLE
HAVING COME TO THE SPELLING SCHOOL TO GET MATERIALS FOR A LETTER TO A
FEMALE FRIEND FIRST SHONE UPON MR
HORNER
SHE WAS EXCESSIVELY AMUSED
BY HIS SOLEMN AIR AND PUCKERED MOUTH AND SET HIM DOWN AT ONCE AS FAIR
GAME
YET SHE COULD NOT HELP BECOMING SOMEWHAT INTERESTED IN THE
SPELLING SCHOOL AND AFTER IT WAS OVER FOUND SHE HAD NOT STORED UP
HALF AS MANY OF THE SCHOOLMASTER'S POINTS AS SHE INTENDED FOR THE
BENEFIT OF HER CORRESPONDENT
IN THE EVENING'S CONTEST A YOUNG GIRL FROM SOME FEW MILES' DISTANCE
ELLEN KINGSBURY THE ONLY CHILD OF A SUBSTANTIAL FARMER HAD BEEN THE
VERY LAST TO SIT DOWN AFTER A PROLONGED EFFORT ON THE PART OF MR
HORNER TO PUZZLE HER FOR THE CREDIT OF HIS OWN SCHOOL
SHE BLUSHED
AND SMILED AND BLUSHED AGAIN BUT SPELT ON UNTIL MR
HORNER'S CHEEKS
WERE CRIMSON WITH EXCITEMENT AND SOME TOUCH OF SHAME THAT HE SHOULD BE
BAFFLED AT HIS OWN WEAPONS
AT LENGTH EITHER BY ACCIDENT OR DESIGN
ELLEN MISSED A WORD AND SINKING INTO HER SEAT WAS NUMBERED WITH THE
SLAIN
IN THE LAUGH AND TALK WHICH FOLLOWED FOR WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE
SPELLING ALL FORM OF A PUBLIC ASSEMBLY VANISHES OUR SCHOOLMASTER
SAID SO MANY GALLANT THINGS TO HIS FAIR ENEMY AND APPEARED SO MUCH
ANIMATED BY THE EXCITEMENT OF THE CONTEST THAT MISS BANGLE BEGAN TO
LOOK UPON HIM WITH RATHER MORE RESPECT AND TO FEEL SOMEWHAT INDIGNANT
THAT A LITTLE RUSTIC LIKE ELLEN SHOULD ABSORB THE ENTIRE ATTENTION OF
THE ONLY BEAU
SHE PUT ON THEREFORE HER MOST GRACIOUS ASPECT AND
MINGLED IN THE CIRCLE CAUSED THE SCHOOLMASTER TO BE PRESENTED TO HER
AND DID HER BEST TO FASCINATE HIM BY CERTAIN AIRS AND GRACES WHICH SHE
HAD FOUND SUCCESSFUL ELSEWHERE
WHAT GAME IS TOO SMALL FOR THE
CLOSE WOVEN NET OF A COQUETTE
MR
HORNER QUITTED NOT THE FAIR ELLEN UNTIL HE HAD HANDED HER INTO HER
FATHER'S SLEIGH AND HE THEN WENDED HIS WAY HOMEWARDS NEVER THINKING
THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE ESCORTED MISS BANGLE TO HER UNCLE'S THOUGH SHE
CERTAINLY WAITED A LITTLE WHILE FOR HIS RETURN
WE MUST NOT FOLLOW INTO PARTICULARS THE SUBSEQUENT INTERCOURSE OF OUR
SCHOOLMASTER WITH THE CIVILIZED YOUNG LADY
ALL THAT CONCERNS US IS
THE RESULT OF MISS BANGLE'S BENEVOLENT DESIGNS UPON HIS HEART
SHE
TRIED MOST SINCERELY TO FIND ITS VULNERABLE SPOT MEANING NO DOUBT TO
PUT MR
HOMER ON HIS GUARD FOR THE FUTURE AND SHE WAS UNFEIGNEDLY
SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THAT HER BEST EFFORTS WERE OF NO AVAIL
SHE
CONCLUDED HE MUST HAVE TAKEN A COUNTER POISON AND SHE WAS NOT SLOW IN
GUESSING ITS SOURCE
SHE HAD OBSERVED THE PECULIAR FIRE WHICH LIGHTED
UP HIS EYES IN THE PRESENCE OF ELLEN KINGSBURY AND SHE BETHOUGHT HER
OF A PLAN WHICH WOULD ENSURE HER SOME AMUSEMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF
THESE IMPERTINENT RUSTICS THOUGH IN A MANNER DIFFERENT SOMEWHAT FROM
HER ORIGINAL MORE NATURAL IDEA OF SIMPLE COQUETRY
A LETTER WAS WRITTEN TO MASTER HORNER PURPORTING TO COME FROM ELLEN
KINGSBURY WORDED SO ARTFULLY THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER UNDERSTOOD AT ONCE
THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE A SECRET COMMUNICATION THOUGH ITS
OSTENSIBLE OBJECT WAS AN INQUIRY ABOUT SOME ORDINARY AFFAIR
THIS WAS
LAID IN MR
HORNER'S DESK BEFORE HE CAME TO SCHOOL WITH AN INTIMATION
THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE AN ANSWER IN A CERTAIN SPOT ON THE FOLLOWING
MORNING
THE BAIT TOOK AT ONCE FOR MR
HORNER HONEST AND TRUE
HIMSELF AND MUCH SMITTEN WITH THE FAIR ELLEN WAS TOO HAPPY TO BE
CIRCUMSPECT
THE ANSWER WAS DULY PLACED AND AS DULY CARRIED TO MISS
BANGLE BY HER ACCOMPLICE JOE ENGLEHART AN UNLUCKY PICKLE WHO WAS
ALWAYS FOR ILL NEVER FOR GOOD AND WHO FOUND NO DIFFICULTY IN
OBTAINING THE LETTER UNWATCHED SINCE THE MASTER WAS OBLIGED TO BE IN
SCHOOL AT NINE AND JOE COULD ALWAYS LINGER A FEW MINUTES LATER
THIS
ANSWER BEING OPENED AND LAUGHED AT MISS BANGLE HAD ONLY TO CONTRIVE A
REJOINDER WHICH BEING RATHER MORE PARTICULAR IN ITS TONE THAN THE
ORIGINAL COMMUNICATION LED ON YET AGAIN THE HAPPY SCHOOLMASTER WHO
BRANCHED OUT INTO SENTIMENT TAFFETA PHRASES SILKEN TERMS PRECISE
TALKED OF HILLS AND DALES AND RIVULETS AND THE PLEASURES OF
FRIENDSHIP AND CONCLUDED BY ENTREATING A CONTINUANCE OF THE
CORRESPONDENCE
ANOTHER LETTER AND ANOTHER EVERY ONE MORE FLATTERING AND ENCOURAGING
THAN THE LAST ALMOST TURNED THE SOBER HEAD OF OUR POOR MASTER AND
WARMED UP HIS HEART SO EFFECTUALLY THAT HE COULD SCARCELY ATTEND TO
HIS BUSINESS
THE SPELLING SCHOOLS WERE REMEMBERED HOWEVER AND ELLEN
KINGSBURY MADE ONE OF THE MERRY COMPANY BUT THE LATEST LETTER HAD NOT
FORGOTTEN TO CAUTION MR
HORNER NOT TO BETRAY THE INTIMACY SO THAT HE
WAS IN HONOR BOUND TO RESTRICT HIMSELF TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE EYES
HARD AS IT WAS TO FORBEAR THE SINGLE WHISPER FOR WHICH HE WOULD HAVE
GIVEN HIS VERY DICTIONARY
SO THEIR MEETING PASSED OFF WITHOUT THE
EXPLANATION WHICH MISS BANGLE BEGAN TO FEAR WOULD CUT SHORT HER
BENEVOLENT AMUSEMENT
THE CORRESPONDENCE WAS RESUMED WITH RENEWED SPIRIT AND CARRIED ON
UNTIL MISS BANGLE THOUGH NOT OVERBURDENED WITH SENSITIVENESS BEGAN
TO BE A LITTLE ALARMED FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER MALICIOUS
PLEASANTRY
SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE HERSELF HAD TURNED SCHOOLMISTRESS
AND THAT MASTER HORNER INSTEAD OF BEING MERELY HER DUPE HAD BECOME
HER PUPIL TOO FOR THE STYLE OF HIS REPLIES HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY
IMPROVING AND THE EARNEST AND MANLY TONE WHICH HE ASSUMED PROMISED ANY
THING BUT THE QUIET SHEEPISH POCKETING OF INJURY AND INSULT UPON
WHICH SHE HAD COUNTED
IN TRUTH THERE WAS SOMETHING DEEPER THAN
VANITY IN THE FEELINGS WITH WHICH HE REGARDED ELLEN KINGSBURY
THE
ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH HE SUPPOSED HIMSELF TO HAVE RECEIVED THREW DOWN
THE BARRIER WHICH HIS EXTREME BASHFULNESS WOULD HAVE INTERPOSED
BETWEEN HIMSELF AND ANY ONE WHO POSSESSED CHARMS ENOUGH TO ATTRACT
HIM AND WE MUST EXCUSE HIM IF IN SUCH A CASE HE DID NOT CRITICISE
THE MODE OF ENCOURAGEMENT BUT RATHER GRASPED EAGERLY THE PROFFERED
GOOD WITHOUT A SCRUPLE OR ONE WHICH HE WOULD OWN TO HIMSELF AS TO
THE PROPRIETY WITH WHICH IT WAS TENDERED
HE WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS A
MAN CAN BE AND THE SERIOUSNESS OF REAL ATTACHMENT GAVE BOTH GRACE AND
DIGNITY TO HIS ONCE AWKWARD DICTION
THE EVIDENT DETERMINATION OF MR
HORNER TO COME TO THE POINT OF ASKING
PAPA BROUGHT MISS BANGLE TO A VERY AWKWARD PASS
SHE HAD EXPECTED TO
RETURN HOME BEFORE MATTERS HAD PROCEEDED SO FAR BUT BEING OBLIGED TO
REMAIN SOME TIME LONGER SHE WAS EQUALLY AFRAID TO GO ON AND TO LEAVE
OFF A DNOUEMENT BEING ALMOST CERTAIN TO ENSUE IN EITHER CASE
THINGS STOOD THUS WHEN IT WAS TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE GRAND EXHIBITION
WHICH WAS TO CLOSE THE WINTER'S TERM
THIS IS AN AFFAIR OF TOO MUCH MAGNITUDE TO BE FULLY DESCRIBED IN THE
SMALL SPACE YET REMAINING IN WHICH TO BRING OUT OUR VERACIOUS HISTORY
IT MUST BE SLUBBER'D O'ER IN HASTE ITS IMPORTANT PRELIMINARIES LEFT
TO THE COLD IMAGINATION OF THE READER ITS FINE SPIRIT PERHAPS
EVAPORATING FOR WANT OF BEING EMBODIED IN WORDS
WE CAN ONLY SAY THAT
OUR MASTER WHOSE SCHOOL LIFE WAS TO CLOSE WITH THE TERM LABORED AS
MAN NEVER BEFORE LABORED IN SUCH A CAUSE RESOLUTE TO TRAIL A CLOUD OF
GLORY AFTER HIM WHEN HE LEFT US
NOT A CANDLESTICK NOR A CURTAIN THAT
WAS ATTAINABLE EITHER BY COAXING OR BRIBERY WAS LEFT IN THE VILLAGE
EVEN THE ONLY PIANO THAT FRAIL TREASURE WAS WILED AWAY AND PLACED IN
ONE CORNER OF THE RICKETY STAGE
THE MOST SPLENDID OF ALL THE PIECES
IN THE COLUMBIAN ORATOR THE AMERICAN SPEAKER THE BUT WE MUST
NOT ENUMERATE IN A WORD THE MOST ASTOUNDING AND PATHETIC SPECIMENS
OF ELOQUENCE WITHIN KEN OF EITHER TEACHER OR SCHOLARS HAD BEEN
SELECTED FOR THE OCCASION AND SEVERAL YOUNG LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
WHOSE ACADEMICAL COURSE HAD BEEN HAPPILY CONCLUDED AT AN EARLIER
PERIOD EITHER AT OUR OWN INSTITUTION OR AT SOME OTHER HAD CONSENTED
TO LEND THEMSELVES TO THE PARTS AND THEIR CHOICEST DECORATIONS FOR
THE PROPERTIES OF THE DRAMATIC PORTION OF THE ENTERTAINMENT
AMONG THESE LAST WAS PRETTY ELLEN KINGSBURY WHO HAD AGREED TO
PERSONATE THE QUEEN OF SCOTS IN THE GARDEN SCENE FROM SCHILLER'S
TRAGEDY OF MARY STUART AND THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ACCIDENTALLY AFFORDED
MASTER HORNER THE OPPORTUNITY HE HAD SO LONG DESIRED OF SEEING HIS
FASCINATING CORRESPONDENT WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF PEERING EYES
A
DRESS REHEARSAL OCCUPIED THE AFTERNOON BEFORE THE DAY OF DAYS AND THE
PATHETIC EXPOSTULATIONS OF THE LOVELY MARY
MINE ALL DOTH HANG MY LIFE MY DESTINY
UPON MY WORDS UPON THE FORCE OF TEARS
AIDED BY THE LONG VEIL AND THE EMOTION WHICH SYMPATHY BROUGHT INTO
ELLEN'S COUNTENANCE PROVED TOO MUCH FOR THE ENFORCED PRUDENCE OF
MASTER HORNER
WHEN THE REHEARSAL WAS OVER AND THE HEROES AND
HEROINES WERE TO RETURN HOME IT WAS FOUND THAT BY A STROKE OF WITTY
INVENTION NOT NEW IN THE COUNTRY THE HARNESS OF MR
KINGSBURY'S
HORSES HAD BEEN CUT IN SEVERAL PLACES HIS WHIP HIDDEN HIS
BUFFALO SKINS SPREAD ON THE GROUND AND THE SLEIGH TURNED BOTTOM
UPWARDS ON THEM
THIS AFFORDED AN EXCUSE FOR THE MASTER'S BORROWING A
HORSE AND SLEIGH OF SOMEBODY AND CLAIMING THE PRIVILEGE OF TAKING
MISS ELLEN HOME WHILE HER FATHER RETURNED WITH ONLY AUNT SALLY AND A
GREAT BAG OF BRAN FROM THE MILL COMPANIONS ABOUT EQUALLY INTERESTING
HERE THEN WAS THE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY SO LONG WISHED FOR HERE WAS
THE POWER OF ASCERTAINING AT ONCE WHAT IS NEVER QUITE CERTAIN UNTIL WE
HAVE HEARD IT FROM WARM LIVING LIPS WHOSE TESTIMONY IS STRENGTHENED
BY GLANCES IN WHICH THE WHOLE SOUL SPEAKS OR SEEMS TO SPEAK
THE TIME
WAS SHORT FOR THE SLEIGHING WAS BUT TOO FINE AND FATHER KINGSBURY
HAVING TIED UP HIS HARNESS AND COLLECTED HIS SCATTERED EQUIPMENT WAS
DRIVING SO CLOSE BEHIND THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF LINGERING FOR
A MOMENT
YET MANY MOMENTS WERE LOST BEFORE MR
HORNER VERY MUCH IN
EARNEST AND ALL UNHACKNEYED IN MATTERS OF THIS SORT COULD FIND A
WORD IN WHICH TO CLOTHE HIS NEW FOUND FEELINGS
THE HORSE SEEMED TO
FLY THE DISTANCE WAS HALF PAST AND AT LENGTH IN ABSOLUTE DESPAIR OF
ANYTHING BETTER HE BLURTED OUT AT ONCE WHAT HE HAD DETERMINED TO
AVOID A DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE CORRESPONDENCE
A GAME AT CROSS PURPOSES ENSUED EXCLAMATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS AND
DENIALS AND APOLOGIES FILLED UP THE TIME WHICH WAS TO HAVE MADE MASTER
HORNER SO BLEST
THE LIGHT FROM MR
KINGSBURY'S WINDOWS SHONE UPON THE
PATH AND THE WHOLE RESULT OF THIS CONFERENCE SO LONGED FOR WAS A
BURST OF TEARS FROM THE PERPLEXED AND MORTIFIED ELLEN WHO SPRANG FROM
MR
HORNER'S ATTEMPTS TO DETAIN HER RUSHED INTO THE HOUSE WITHOUT
VOUCHSAFING HIM A WORD OF ADIEU AND LEFT HIM STANDING NO BAD
PERSONIFICATION OF ORPHEUS AFTER THE LAST HOPELESS FLITTING OF HIS
EURYDICE
WON'T YOU 'LIGHT MASTER SAID MR
KINGSBURY
YES NO THANK YOU GOOD EVENING STAMMERED POOR MASTER HORNER SO
STUPEFIED THAT EVEN AUNT SALLY CALLED HIM A DUMMY
THE HORSE TOOK THE SLEIGH AGAINST THE FENCE GOING HOME AND THREW OUT
THE MASTER WHO SCARCELY RECOLLECTED THE ACCIDENT WHILE TO ELLEN THE
ISSUE OF THIS UNFORTUNATE DRIVE WAS A SLEEPLESS NIGHT AND SO HIGH A
FEVER IN THE MORNING THAT OUR VILLAGE DOCTOR WAS CALLED TO MR
KINGSBURY'S BEFORE BREAKFAST
POOR MASTER HORNER'S DISTRESS MAY HARDLY BE IMAGINED
DISAPPOINTED
BEWILDERED CUT TO THE QUICK YET AS MUCH IN LOVE AS EVER HE COULD
ONLY IN BITTER SILENCE TURN OVER IN HIS THOUGHTS THE ISSUE OF HIS
CHERISHED DREAM NOW PERSUADING HIMSELF THAT ELLEN'S DENIAL WAS THE
EFFECT OF A SUDDEN BASHFULNESS NOW INVEIGHING AGAINST THE FICKLENESS
OF THE SEX AS ALL MEN DO WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY WITH ANY ONE WOMAN IN
PARTICULAR
BUT HIS EXHIBITION MUST GO ON IN SPITE OF WRETCHEDNESS
AND HE WENT ABOUT MECHANICALLY TALKING OF CURTAINS AND CANDLES AND
MUSIC AND ATTITUDES AND PAUSES AND EMPHASIS LOOKING LIKE A
SOMNAMBULIST WHOSE EYES ARE OPEN BUT THEIR SENSE IS SHUT AND OFTEN
SURPRISING THOSE CONCERNED BY THE UTTER UNFITNESS OF HIS ANSWERS
IT WAS ALMOST EVENING WHEN MR
KINGSBURY HAVING DISCOVERED THROUGH
THE INTERVENTION OF THE DOCTOR AND AUNT SALLY THE CAUSE OF ELLEN'S
DISTRESS MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEFORE THE UNHAPPY EYES OF MASTER
HORNER ANGRY SOLEMN AND DETERMINED TAKING THE SCHOOLMASTER APART
AND REQUIRING AN EXPLANATION OF HIS TREATMENT OF HIS DAUGHTER
IN
VAIN DID THE PERPLEXED LOVER ASK FOR TIME TO CLEAR HIMSELF DECLARE
HIS RESPECT FOR MISS ELLEN AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO GIVE EVERY
EXPLANATION WHICH SHE MIGHT REQUIRE THE FATHER WAS NOT TO BE PUT OFF
AND THOUGH EXCESSIVELY RELUCTANT MR
HORNER HAD NO RESOURCE BUT TO
SHOW THE LETTERS WHICH ALONE COULD ACCOUNT FOR HIS STRANGE DISCOURSE
TO ELLEN
HE UNLOCKED HIS DESK SLOWLY AND UNWILLINGLY WHILE THE OLD
MAN'S IMPATIENCE WAS SUCH THAT HE COULD SCARCELY FORBEAR THRUSTING IN
HIS OWN HAND TO SNATCH AT THE PAPERS WHICH WERE TO EXPLAIN THIS
VEXATIOUS MYSTERY
WHAT COULD EQUAL THE UTTER CONFUSION OF MASTER
HORNER AND THE CONTEMPTUOUS ANGER OF THE FATHER WHEN NO LETTERS WERE
TO BE FOUND MR
KINGSBURY WAS TOO PASSIONATE TO LISTEN TO REASON OR
TO REFLECT FOR ONE MOMENT UPON THE IRREPROACHABLE GOOD NAME OF THE
SCHOOLMASTER
HE WENT AWAY IN INEXORABLE WRATH THREATENING EVERY
PRACTICABLE VISITATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE JUSTICE UPON THE HEAD OF
THE OFFENDER WHOM HE ACCUSED OF HAVING ATTEMPTED TO TRICK HIS
DAUGHTER INTO AN ENTANGLEMENT WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN HIS FAVOR
A DOLEFUL EXHIBITION WAS THIS LAST ONE OF OUR THRICE APPROVED AND MOST
WORTHY TEACHER STERN NECESSITY AND THE POWER OF HABIT ENABLED HIM TO
GO THROUGH WITH MOST OF HIS PART BUT WHERE WAS THE PROUD FIRE WHICH
HAD LIGHTED UP HIS EYE ON SIMILAR OCCASIONS BEFORE HE SAT AS ONE OF
THREE JUDGES BEFORE WHOM THE UNFORTUNATE ROBERT EMMET WAS DRAGGED IN
HIS SHIRT SLEEVES BY TWO FIERCE LOOKING OFFICIALS BUT THE CHIEF
JUDGE LOOKED FAR MORE LIKE A CRIMINAL THAN DID THE PROPER
REPRESENTATIVE
HE OUGHT TO HAVE PERSONATED OTHELLO BUT WAS OBLIGED
TO EXCUSE HIMSELF FROM RAVING FOR THE HANDKERCHIEF THE
HANDKERCHIEF ON THE RATHER ANOMALOUS PLEA OF A BAD COLD
MARY
STUART BEING I' THE BOND WAS ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED BY THE IMPATIENT
CROWD AND IT WAS WITH DISTRESS AMOUNTING TO AGONY THAT THE MASTER WAS
OBLIGED TO ANNOUNCE IN PERSON THE NECESSITY OF OMITTING THAT PART OF
THE REPRESENTATION ON ACCOUNT OF THE ILLNESS OF ONE OF THE YOUNG
LADIES
SCARCELY HAD THE WORDS BEEN UTTERED AND THE SPEAKER HIDDEN HIS
BURNING FACE BEHIND THE CURTAIN WHEN MR
KINGSBURY STARTED UP IN HIS
PLACE AMID THE THRONG TO GIVE A PUBLIC RECITAL OF HIS GRIEVANCE NO
UNCOMMON RESORT IN THE NEW COUNTRY
HE DASHED AT ONCE TO THE POINT
AND BEFORE SOME FRIENDS WHO SAW THE UTTER IMPROPRIETY OF HIS
PROCEEDING COULD PERSUADE HIM TO DEFER HIS VENGEANCE HE HAD LAID
BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY SOME THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE PERHAPS HIS OWN
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
HE WAS GOT OUT AT LAST HALF COAXED HALF
HUSTLED AND THE GENTLE PUBLIC ONLY HALF UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAD BEEN
SET FORTH THUS UNEXPECTEDLY MADE QUITE A PRETTY ROW OF IT
SOME
CLAMORED LOUDLY FOR THE CONCLUSION OF THE EXERCISES OTHERS GAVE
UTTERANCES IN NO PARTICULARLY CHOICE TERMS TO A VARIETY OF OPINIONS AS
TO THE SCHOOLMASTER'S PROCEEDINGS VARYING THE NOTE OCCASIONALLY BY
SHOUTING THE LETTERS THE LETTERS WHY DON'T YOU BRING OUT THE
LETTERS
AT LENGTH BY MEANS OF MUCH RAPPING ON THE DESK BY THE PRESIDENT OF
THE EVENING WHO WAS FORTUNATELY A POPULAR CHARACTER ORDER WAS
PARTIALLY RESTORED AND THE FAVORITE SCENE FROM MISS MORE'S DIALOGUE
OF DAVID AND GOLIATH WAS ANNOUNCED AS THE CLOSING PIECE
THE SIGHT OF
LITTLE DAVID IN A WHITE TUNIC EDGED WITH RED TAPE WITH A CALICO SCRIP
AND A VERY PRIMITIVE LOOKING SLING AND A HUGE GOLIATH DECORATED WITH
A MILITIA BELT AND SWORD AND A SPEAR LIKE A WEAVER'S BEAM INDEED
ENCHAINED EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION
EVEN THE PECCANT SCHOOLMASTER AND HIS
PRETENDED LETTERS WERE FORGOTTEN WHILE THE SAPIENT GOLIATH EVERY
TIME THAT HE RAISED THE SPEAR IN THE ENERGY OF HIS DECLAMATION TO
THUMP UPON THE STAGE PICKED AWAY FRAGMENTS OF THE LOW CEILING WHICH
FELL CONSPICUOUSLY ON HIS GREAT SHOCK OF BLACK HAIR
AT LAST WITH THE
CROWNING THREAT UP WENT THE SPEAR FOR AN ASTOUNDING THUMP AND DOWN
CAME A LARGE PIECE OF THE CEILING AND WITH IT A SHOWER OF LETTERS
THE CONFUSION THAT ENSUED BEGGARS ALL DESCRIPTION
A GENERAL SCRAMBLE
TOOK PLACE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT TWENTY PAIRS OF EYES AT LEAST WERE
FEASTING ON THE CHOICE PHRASES LAVISHED UPON MR
HORNER
MISS BANGLE
HAD SAT THROUGH THE WHOLE PREVIOUS SCENE TREMBLING FOR HERSELF
ALTHOUGH SHE HAD AS SHE SUPPOSED GUARDED CUNNINGLY AGAINST EXPOSURE
SHE HAD NEEDED NO PROPHET TO TELL HER WHAT MUST BE THE RESULT OF A
TTE TTE BETWEEN MR
HORNER AND ELLEN AND THE MOMENT SHE SAW THEM
DRIVE OFF TOGETHER SHE INDUCED HER IMP TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY OF
ABSTRACTING THE WHOLE PARCEL OF LETTERS FROM MR
HORNER'S DESK WHICH
HE DID BY MEANS OF A SORT OF SKILL WHICH COMES BY NATURE TO SUCH
GOBLINS PICKING THE LOCK BY THE AID OF A CROOKED NAIL AS NEATLY AS
IF HE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN THE SHADOW OF THE TOMBS
BUT MAGICIANS SOMETIMES SUFFER SEVERELY FROM THE MALICE WITH WHICH
THEY HAVE THEMSELVES INSPIRED THEIR FAMILIARS
JOE ENGLEHART HAVING
BEEN A CONVENIENT TOOL THUS FAR THOUGHT IT QUITE TIME TO TORMENT MISS
BANGLE A LITTLE SO HAVING STOLEN THE LETTERS AT HER BIDDING HE HID
THEM ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND NO PERSUASIONS OF HERS COULD INDUCE HIM
TO REVEAL THIS IMPORTANT SECRET WHICH HE CHOSE TO RESERVE AS A ROD IN
CASE SHE REFUSED HIM SOME INTERCESSION WITH HIS FATHER OR SOME OTHER
ACCOMMODATION RENDERED NECESSARY BY HIS MISCHIEVOUS HABITS
HE HAD CONCEALED THE PRECIOUS PARCELS IN THE UNFLOORED LOFT ABOVE THE
SCHOOL ROOM A PLACE ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY MEANS OF A SMALL TRAP DOOR
WITHOUT STAIRCASE OR LADDER AND HERE HE MEANT TO HAVE KEPT THEM WHILE
IT SUITED HIS PURPOSES BUT FOR THE UNTIMELY INTRUSION OF THE WEAVER'S
BEAM
MISS BANGLE HAD SAT THROUGH ALL AS WE HAVE SAID THINKING THE LETTERS
SAFE YET VOWING VENGEANCE AGAINST HER CONFEDERATE FOR NOT ALLOWING
HER TO SECURE THEM BY A SATISFACTORY CONFLAGRATION AND IT WAS NOT
UNTIL SHE HEARD HER OWN NAME WHISPERED THROUGH THE CROWD THAT SHE WAS
AWAKENED TO HER TRUE SITUATION
THE SAGACITY OF THE LOW CREATURES WHOM
SHE HAD DESPISED SHOWED THEM AT ONCE THAT THE LETTERS MUST BE HERS
SINCE HER CHARACTER HAD BEEN PRETTY SHREWDLY GUESSED AND THE
HANDWRITING WORE A MORE PRACTISED AIR THAN IS USUAL AMONG FEMALES IN
THE COUNTRY
THIS WAS FIRST TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND THEN SPOKEN OF AS
AN ACKNOWLEDGED FACT
THE ASSEMBLY MOVED LIKE THE HEAVINGS OF A TROUBLED SEA
EVERYBODY FELT
THAT THIS WAS EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS
PUT HER OUT WAS HEARD FROM MORE
THAN ONE ROUGH VOICE NEAR THE DOOR AND THIS WAS RESPONDED TO BY LOUD
AND ANGRY MURMURS FROM WITHIN
MR
ENGLEHART NOT WAITING TO INQUIRE INTO THE MERITS OF THE CASE IN
THIS SCENE OF CONFUSION HASTENED TO GET HIS FAMILY OUT AS QUIETLY AND
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT GROANS AND HISSES FOLLOWED HIS NIECE AS
SHE HUNG HALF FAINTING ON HIS ARM QUAILING COMPLETELY BENEATH THE
INSTINCTIVE INDIGNATION OF THE RUSTIC PUBLIC
AS SHE PASSED OUT A
YELL RESOUNDED AMONG THE RUDE BOYS ABOUT THE DOOR AND SHE WAS LIFTED
INTO A SLEIGH INSENSIBLE FROM TERROR
SHE DISAPPEARED FROM THAT
EVENING AND NO ONE KNEW THE TIME OF HER FINAL DEPARTURE FOR THE
EAST
MR
KINGSBURY WHO IS A JUST MAN WHEN HE IS NOT IN A PASSION MADE ALL
THE REPARATION IN HIS POWER FOR HIS HARSH AND ILL CONSIDERED ATTACK
UPON THE MASTER AND WE BELIEVE THAT FUNCTIONARY DID NOT SHOW ANY
TRAITS OF IMPLACABILITY OF CHARACTER
AT LEAST HE WAS SEEN NOT MANY
DAYS AFTER SITTING PEACEABLY AT TEA WITH MR
KINGSBURY AUNT SALLY
AND MISS ELLEN AND HE HAS SINCE GONE HOME TO BUILD A HOUSE UPON HIS
FARM
AND PEOPLE DO SAY THAT AFTER A FEW MONTHS MORE ELLEN WILL
NOT NEED MISS BANGLE'S INTERVENTION IF SHE SHOULD SEE FIT TO
CORRESPOND WITH THE SCHOOLMASTER
THE WATKINSON EVENING
FROM GODEY'S LADY'S BOOK DECEMBER 1846
BY ELIZA LESLIE 1787 1858
MRS
MORLAND A POLISHED AND ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN WAS THE WIDOW OF A
DISTINGUISHED SENATOR FROM ONE OF THE WESTERN STATES OF WHICH ALSO
HER HUSBAND HAD TWICE FILLED THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR
HER DAUGHTER
HAVING COMPLETED HER EDUCATION AT THE BEST BOARDING SCHOOL IN
PHILADELPHIA AND HER SON BEING ABOUT TO GRADUATE AT PRINCETON THE
MOTHER HAD PLANNED WITH HER CHILDREN A TOUR TO NIAGARA AND THE LAKES
RETURNING BY WAY OF BOSTON
ON LEAVING PHILADELPHIA MRS
MORLAND AND
THE DELIGHTED CAROLINE STOPPED AT PRINCETON TO BE PRESENT AT THE
ANNUAL COMMENCEMENT AND HAD THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING THEIR BELOVED
EDWARD RECEIVE HIS DIPLOMA AS BACHELOR OF ARTS AFTER HEARING HIM
DELIVER WITH GREAT APPLAUSE AN ORATION ON THE BEAUTIES OF THE
AMERICAN CHARACTER
COLLEGE YOUTHS ARE VERY PRONE TO TREAT ON SUBJECTS
THAT IMPLY GREAT EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD
BUT EDWARD MORLAND WAS FULL
OF KIND FEELING FOR EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY AND HIS VIEWS OF LIFE
HAD HITHERTO BEEN TINTED WITH A PERPETUAL ROSE COLOR
MRS
MORLAND NOT DEPENDING ALTOGETHER UPON THE CELEBRITY OF HER LATE
HUSBAND AND WISHING THAT HER CHILDREN SHOULD SEE SPECIMENS OF THE
BEST SOCIETY IN THE NORTHERN CITIES HAD LEFT HOME WITH NUMEROUS
LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION
BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT NEW YORK SHE FOUND
TO HER GREAT REGRET THAT HAVING UNPACKED AND TAKEN OUT HER SMALL
TRAVELING DESK DURING HER SHORT STAY IN PHILADELPHIA SHE HAD
STRANGELY LEFT IT BEHIND IN THE CLOSET OF HER ROOM AT THE HOTEL
IN
THIS DESK WERE DEPOSITED ALL HER LETTERS EXCEPT TWO WHICH HAD BEEN
OFFERED TO HER BY FRIENDS IN PHILADELPHIA
THE YOUNG PEOPLE IMPATIENT
TO SEE THE WONDERS OF NIAGARA HAD ENTREATED HER TO STAY BUT A DAY OR
TWO IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND THOUGHT THESE TWO LETTERS WOULD BE
QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PRESENT
IN THE MEANTIME SHE WROTE BACK TO
THE HOTEL REQUESTING THAT THE MISSING DESK SHOULD BE FORWARDED TO NEW
YORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
ON THE MORNING AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT COMMERCIAL METROPOLIS
OF AMERICA THE MORLAND FAMILY TOOK A CARRIAGE TO RIDE ROUND THROUGH
THE PRINCIPAL PARTS OF THE CITY AND TO DELIVER THEIR TWO LETTERS AT
THE HOUSES TO WHICH THEY WERE ADDRESSED AND WHICH WERE BOTH SITUATED
IN THE REGION THAT LIES BETWEEN THE UPPER PART OF BROADWAY AND THE
NORTH RIVER
IN ONE OF THE MOST FASHIONABLE STREETS THEY FOUND THE
ELEGANT MANSION OF MRS
ST
LEONARD BUT ON STOPPING AT THE DOOR WERE
INFORMED THAT ITS MISTRESS WAS NOT AT HOME
THEY THEN LEFT THE
INTRODUCTORY LETTER WHICH THEY HAD PREPARED FOR THIS MISCHANCE BY
ENCLOSING IT IN AN ENVELOPE WITH A CARD AND PROCEEDING TO ANOTHER
STREET CONSIDERABLY FARTHER UP THEY ARRIVED AT THE DWELLING OF THE
WATKINSON FAMILY TO THE MISTRESS OF WHICH THE OTHER PHILADELPHIA
LETTER WAS DIRECTED
IT WAS ONE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF HOUSES ALL EXACTLY
ALIKE AND ALL SHUT UP FROM TOP TO BOTTOM ACCORDING TO A CUSTOM MORE
PREVALENT IN NEW YORK THAN IN ANY OTHER CITY
HERE THEY WERE ALSO UNSUCCESSFUL THE SERVANT WHO CAME TO THE DOOR
TELLING THEM THAT THE LADIES WERE PARTICULARLY ENGAGED AND COULD SEE
NO COMPANY
SO THEY LEFT THEIR SECOND LETTER AND CARD AND DROVE OFF
CONTINUING THEIR RIDE TILL THEY REACHED THE CROTON WATER WORKS WHICH
THEY QUITTED THE CARRIAGE TO SEE AND ADMIRE
ON RETURNING TO THE
HOTEL WITH THE INTENTION AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO OF REST TO GO OUT
AGAIN AND WALK TILL NEAR DINNER TIME THEY FOUND WAITING THEM A NOTE
FROM MRS
WATKINSON EXPRESSING HER REGRET THAT SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE
TO SEE THEM WHEN THEY CALLED AND EXPLAINING THAT HER FAMILY DUTIES
ALWAYS OBLIGED HER TO DENY HERSELF THE PLEASURE OF RECEIVING MORNING
VISITORS AND THAT HER SERVANTS HAD GENERAL ORDERS TO THAT EFFECT
BUT
SHE REQUESTED THEIR COMPANY FOR THAT EVENING NAMING NINE O'CLOCK AS
THE HOUR AND PARTICULARLY DESIRED AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER
I SUPPOSE SAID MRS
MORLAND SHE INTENDS ASKING SOME OF HER
FRIENDS TO MEET US IN CASE WE ACCEPT THE INVITATION AND THEREFORE IS
NATURALLY DESIROUS OF A REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
OF COURSE WE WILL
NOT KEEP HER IN SUSPENSE
MRS
DENHAM WHO VOLUNTEERED THE LETTER
ASSURED ME THAT MRS
WATKINSON WAS ONE OF THE MOST ESTIMABLE WOMEN IN
NEW YORK AND A PATTERN TO THE CIRCLE IN WHICH SHE MOVED
IT SEEMS
THAT MR
DENHAM AND MR
WATKINSON ARE CONNECTED IN BUSINESS
SHALL WE
GO
THE YOUNG PEOPLE ASSENTED SAYING THEY HAD NO DOUBT OF PASSING A
PLEASANT EVENING
THE BILLET OF ACCEPTANCE HAVING BEEN WRITTEN IT WAS SENT OFF
IMMEDIATELY ENTRUSTED TO ONE OF THE ERRAND GOERS BELONGING TO THE
HOTEL THAT IT MIGHT BE RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT HOUR FOR THE
DISPATCH POST AND EDWARD MORLAND DESIRED THE MAN TO GET INTO AN
OMNIBUS WITH THE NOTE THAT NO TIME MIGHT BE LOST IN DELIVERING IT
IT
IS BUT RIGHT SAID HE TO HIS MOTHER THAT WE SHOULD GIVE MRS
WATKINSON AN AMPLE OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING HER PREPARATIONS AND SENDING
ROUND TO INVITE HER FRIENDS
HOW CONSIDERATE YOU ARE DEAR EDWARD SAID CAROLINE ALWAYS SO
THOUGHTFUL OF EVERY ONE'S CONVENIENCE
YOUR COLLEGE FRIENDS MUST HAVE
IDOLIZED YOU
NO SAID EDWARD THEY CALLED ME A PRIG JUST THEN A REMARKABLY
HANDSOME CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO THE PRIVATE DOOR OF THE HOTEL
FROM IT
ALIGHTED A VERY ELEGANT WOMAN WHO IN A FEW MOMENTS WAS USHERED INTO
THE DRAWING ROOM BY THE HEAD WAITER AND ON HIS DESIGNATING MRS
MORLAND'S FAMILY SHE ADVANCED AND GRACEFULLY ANNOUNCED HERSELF AS
MRS
ST
LEONARD
THIS WAS THE LADY AT WHOSE HOUSE THEY HAD LEFT THE
FIRST LETTER OF INTRODUCTION
SHE EXPRESSED REGRET AT NOT HAVING BEEN
AT HOME WHEN THEY CALLED BUT SAID THAT ON FINDING THEIR LETTER SHE
HAD IMMEDIATELY COME DOWN TO SEE THEM AND TO ENGAGE THEM FOR THE
EVENING
TONIGHT SAID MRS
ST
LEONARD I EXPECT AS MANY FRIENDS
AS I CAN COLLECT FOR A SUMMER PARTY
THE OCCASION IS THE RECENT
MARRIAGE OF MY NIECE WHO WITH HER HUSBAND HAS JUST RETURNED FROM
THEIR BRIDAL EXCURSION AND THEY WILL BE SOON ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR
RESIDENCE IN BALTIMORE
I THINK I CAN PROMISE YOU AN AGREEABLE
EVENING AS I EXPECT SOME VERY DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE WITH WHOM I SHALL BE
MOST HAPPY TO MAKE YOU ACQUAINTED
EDWARD AND CAROLINE EXCHANGED GLANCES AND COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM
LOOKING WISTFULLY AT THEIR MOTHER ON WHOSE COUNTENANCE A SHADE OF
REGRET WAS VERY APPARENT
AFTER A SHORT PAUSE SHE REPLIED TO MRS
ST
LEONARD I AM TRULY SORRY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE JUST ANSWERED IN THE
AFFIRMATIVE A PREVIOUS INVITATION FOR THIS VERY EVENING
I AM INDEED DISAPPOINTED SAID MRS
ST
LEONARD WHO HAD BEEN
LOOKING APPROVINGLY AT THE PREPOSSESSING APPEARANCE OF THE TWO YOUNG
PEOPLE
IS THERE NO WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN REVOKE YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH
THIS UNFORTUNATE FIRST INVITATION AT LEAST I AM SURE IT IS
UNFORTUNATE FOR ME
WHAT A VEXATIOUS CONTRETEMPS THAT I SHOULD HAVE
CHANCED TO BE OUT WHEN YOU CALLED THUS MISSING THE PLEASURE OF SEEING
YOU AT ONCE AND SECURING THAT OF YOUR SOCIETY FOR THIS EVENING THE
TRUTH IS I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS THAT HAD BEEN
SENT HOME THIS MORNING AND I HAD TO GO MYSELF AND HAVE THE THINGS
RECTIFIED AND WAS DETAINED AWAY LONGER THAN I EXPECTED
MAY I ASK TO
WHOM YOU ARE ENGAGED THIS EVENING PERHAPS I KNOW THE LADY IF SO I
SHOULD BE VERY MUCH TEMPTED TO GO AND BEG YOU FROM HER
THE LADY IS MRS
JOHN WATKINSON REPLIED MRS
MORLAND MOST
PROBABLY SHE WILL INVITE SOME OF HER FRIENDS TO MEET US
THAT OF COURSE ANSWERED MRS
ST
LEONARD I AM REALLY VERY
SORRY AND I REGRET TO SAY THAT I DO NOT KNOW HER AT ALL
WE SHALL HAVE TO ABIDE BY OUR FIRST DECISION SAID MRS
MORLAND
BY
MRS
WATKINSON MENTIONING IN HER NOTE THE HOUR OF NINE IT IS TO BE
PRESUMED SHE INTENDS ASKING SOME OTHER COMPANY
I CANNOT POSSIBLY
DISAPPOINT HER
I CAN SPEAK FEELINGLY AS TO THE ANNOYANCE FOR I HAVE
KNOWN IT BY MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN AFTER INVITING A NUMBER OF MY
FRIENDS TO MEET SOME STRANGERS THE STRANGERS HAVE SENT AN EXCUSE
ALMOST AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR
I THINK NO INDUCEMENTS HOWEVER STRONG
COULD TEMPT ME TO DO SO MYSELF
I CONFESS THAT YOU ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT SAID MRS
ST
LEONARD
I
SEE YOU MUST GO TO MRS
WATKINSON
BUT CAN YOU NOT DIVIDE THE EVENING
BY PASSING A PART OF IT WITH HER AND THEN FINISHING WITH ME
AT THIS SUGGESTION THE EYES OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE SPARKLED FOR THEY HAD
BECOME DELIGHTED WITH MRS
ST
LEONARD AND IMAGINED THAT A PARTY AT
HER HOUSE MUST BE EVERY WAY CHARMING
ALSO PARTIES WERE NOVELTIES TO
BOTH OF THEM
IF POSSIBLE WE WILL DO SO ANSWERED MRS
MORLAND AND WITH WHAT
PLEASURE I NEED NOT ASSURE YOU
WE LEAVE NEW YORK TO MORROW BUT WE
SHALL RETURN THIS WAY IN SEPTEMBER AND WILL THEN BE EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY
TO SEE MORE OF MRS
ST
LEONARD
AFTER A LITTLE MORE CONVERSATION MRS
ST
LEONARD TOOK HER LEAVE
REPEATING HER HOPE OF STILL SEEING HER NEW FRIENDS AT HER HOUSE THAT
NIGHT AND ENJOINING THEM TO LET HER KNOW AS SOON AS THEY RETURNED TO
NEW YORK ON THEIR WAY HOME
EDWARD MORLAND HANDED HER TO HER CARRIAGE AND THEN JOINED HIS MOTHER
AND SISTER IN THEIR COMMENDATIONS OF MRS
ST
LEONARD WITH WHOSE
EXCEEDING BEAUTY WERE UNITED A COUNTENANCE BEAMING WITH INTELLIGENCE
AND A MANNER THAT PUT EVERY ONE AT THEIR EASE IMMEDIATELY
SHE IS AN EVIDENCE SAID EDWARD HOW SUPERIOR OUR WOMEN OF FASHION
ARE TO THOSE OF EUROPE
WAIT MY DEAR SON SAID MRS
MORLAND TILL YOU HAVE BEEN IN EUROPE
AND HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF FORMING AN OPINION ON THAT POINT AS ON MANY
OTHERS FROM ACTUAL OBSERVATION
FOR MY PART I BELIEVE THAT IN ALL
CIVILIZED COUNTRIES THE UPPER CLASSES OF PEOPLE ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE
AT LEAST IN THEIR LEADING CHARACTERISTICS
AH HERE COMES THE MAN THAT WAS SENT TO MRS
WATKINSON SAID
CAROLINE MORLAND
I HOPE HE COULD NOT FIND THE HOUSE AND HAS BROUGHT
THE NOTE BACK WITH HIM
WE SHALL THEN BE ABLE TO GO AT FIRST TO MRS
ST
LEONARD'S AND PASS THE WHOLE EVENING THERE
THE MAN REPORTED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE HOUSE AND HAD DELIVERED THE
NOTE INTO MRS
WATKINSON'S OWN HANDS AS SHE CHANCED TO BE CROSSING
THE ENTRY WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND THAT SHE READ IT IMMEDIATELY
AND SAID VERY WELL
ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT YOU MADE NO MISTAKE IN THE HOUSE SAID EDWARD
AND THAT YOU REALLY DID GIVE IT TO MRS
WATKINSON
AND IT'S QUITE SURE I AM SIR REPLIED THE MAN WHEN I FIRST CAME
OVER FROM THE OULD COUNTRY I LIVED WITH THEM AWHILE AND THOUGH WHEN
SHE SAW ME TO DAY SHE DID NOT LET ON THAT SHE REMEMBERED MY DOING
THAT SAME SHE COULD NOT HELP CALLING ME JAMES
YES THE RALE WORDS
SHE SAID WHEN I HANDED HER THE BILLY DUX WAS 'VERY WELL JAMES
COME COME SAID EDWARD WHEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES ALONE LET US
LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE
IF WE DO NOT FIND A LARGE PARTY AT MRS
WATKINSON'S WE MAY IN ALL PROBABILITY MEET SOME VERY AGREEABLE PEOPLE
THERE AND ENJOY THE FEAST OF REASON AND THE FLOW OF SOUL
WE MAY FIND
THE WATKINSON HOUSE SO PLEASANT AS TO LEAVE IT WITH REGRET EVEN FOR
MRS
ST
LEONARD'S
I DO NOT BELIEVE MRS
WATKINSON IS IN FASHIONABLE SOCIETY SAID
CAROLINE OR MRS
ST
LEONARD WOULD HAVE KNOWN HER
I HEARD SOME OF
THE LADIES HERE TALKING LAST EVENING OF MRS
ST
LEONARD AND I FOUND
FROM WHAT THEY SAID THAT SHE IS AMONG THE LITE OF THE LITE
EVEN IF SHE IS OBSERVED MRS
MORLAND ARE POLISH OF MANNERS AND
CULTIVATION OF MIND CONFINED EXCLUSIVELY TO PERSONS OF THAT CLASS
CERTAINLY NOT SAID EDWARD THE MOST TALENTED AND REFINED YOUTH AT
OUR COLLEGE AND HE IN WHOSE SOCIETY I FOUND THE GREATEST PLEASURE
WAS THE SON OF A BRICKLAYER
IN THE LADIES' DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THE MORLANDS HEARD A
CONVERSATION BETWEEN SEVERAL OF THE FEMALE GUESTS WHO ALL SEEMED TO
KNOW MRS
ST
LEONARD VERY WELL BY REPUTATION AND THEY TALKED OF HER
PARTY THAT WAS TO COME OFF ON THIS EVENING
I HEAR SAID ONE LADY THAT MRS
ST
LEONARD IS TO HAVE AN UNUSUAL
NUMBER OF LIONS
SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO NAME A GALLANT GENERAL WITH HIS ELEGANT WIFE
AND ACCOMPLISHED DAUGHTER A CELEBRATED COMMANDER IN THE NAVY TWO
HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND EVEN AN EX PRESIDENT
ALSO SEVERAL OF THE MOST EMINENT AMONG THE AMERICAN LITERATI AND TWO
FIRST RATE ARTISTS
EDWARD MORLAND FELT AS IF HE COULD SAY HAD I THREE EARS I'D HEAR
THEE
SUCH A WOMAN AS MRS
ST
LEONARD CAN ALWAYS COMMAND THE BEST LIONS
THAT ARE TO BE FOUND OBSERVED ANOTHER LADY
AND THEN SAID A THIRD I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SHE HAS SUCH
EXQUISITE TASTE IN LIGHTING AND EMBELLISHING HER ALWAYS ELEGANT ROOMS
AND HER SUPPER TABLE WHETHER FOR SUMMER OR WINTER PARTIES IS SO
BEAUTIFULLY ARRANGED ALL THE VIANDS ARE SO DELICIOUS AND THE
ATTENDANCE OF THE SERVANTS SO PERFECT AND MRS
ST
LEONARD DOES THE
HONORS WITH SO MUCH EASE AND TACT
SOME FRIENDS OF MINE THAT VISIT HER SAID A FOURTH LADY DESCRIBE
HER PARTIES AS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION
SHE ALWAYS MANAGES TO BRING
TOGETHER THOSE PERSONS THAT ARE BEST FITTED TO ENJOY EACH OTHER'S
CONVERSATION
STILL NO ONE IS OVERLOOKED OR NEGLECTED
THEN EVERYTHING
AT HER REUNIONS IS SO WELL PROPORTIONED SHE HAS JUST ENOUGH OF MUSIC
AND JUST ENOUGH OF WHATEVER AMUSEMENT MAY ADD TO THE PLEASURE OF HER
GUESTS AND STILL THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF DESIGN OR MANAGEMENT ON
HER PART
AND BETTER THAN ALL SAID THE LADY WHO HAD SPOKEN FIRSTS MRS
ST
LEONARD IS ONE OF THE KINDEST MOST GENEROUS AND MOST BENEVOLENT OF
WOMEN SHE DOES GOOD IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY
I CAN LISTEN NO LONGER SAID CAROLINE TO EDWARD RISING TO CHANGE
HER SEAT
IF I HEAR ANY MORE I SHALL ABSOLUTELY HATE THE WATKINSONS
HOW PROVOKING THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SENT US THE FIRST INVITATION
IF
WE HAD ONLY THOUGHT OF WAITING TILL WE COULD HEAR FROM MRS
ST
LEONARD
FOR SHAME CAROLINE SAID HER BROTHER HOW CAN YOU TALK SO OF
PERSONS YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN AND TO WHOM YOU OUGHT TO FEEL GRATEFUL
FOR THE KINDNESS OF THEIR INVITATION EVEN IF IT HAS INTERFERED WITH
ANOTHER PARTY THAT I MUST CONFESS SEEMS TO OFFER UNUSUAL ATTRACTIONS
NOW I HAVE A PRESENTIMENT THAT WE SHALL FIND THE WATKINSON PART OF THE
EVENING VERY ENJOYABLE
AS SOON AS TEA WAS OVER MRS
MORLAND AND HER DAUGHTER REPAIRED TO
THEIR TOILETTES
FORTUNATELY FASHION AS WELL AS GOOD TASTE HAS
DECIDED THAT AT A SUMMER PARTY THE COSTUME OF THE LADIES SHOULD
NEVER GO BEYOND AN ELEGANT SIMPLICITY
THEREFORE OUR TWO LADIES IN
PREPARING FOR THEIR INTENDED APPEARANCE AT MRS
ST
LEONARD'S WERE
ENABLED TO ATTIRE THEMSELVES IN A MANNER THAT WOULD NOT SEEM OUT OF
PLACE IN THE SMALLER COMPANY THEY EXPECTED TO MEET AT THE WATKINSONS
OVER AN UNDER DRESS OF LAWN CAROLINE MORLAND PUT ON A WHITE ORGANDY
TRIMMED WITH LACE AND DECORATED WITH BOWS OF PINK RIBBON
AT THE BACK
OF HER HEAD WAS A WREATH OF FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL PINK FLOWERS TIED
WITH A SIMILAR RIBBON
MRS
MORLAND WORE A BLACK GRENADINE OVER A
SATIN AND A LACE CAP TRIMMED WITH WHITE
IT WAS BUT A QUARTER PAST NINE O'CLOCK WHEN THEIR CARRIAGE STOPPED AT
THE WATKINSON DOOR
THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE LOOKED VERY DARK
NOT A RAY
GLEAMED THROUGH THE VENETIAN SHUTTERS AND THE GLIMMER BEYOND THE
FAN LIGHT OVER THE DOOR WAS ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE
AFTER THE COACHMAN
HAD RUNG SEVERAL TIMES AN IRISH GIRL OPENED THE DOOR CAUTIOUSLY AS
IRISH GIRLS ALWAYS DO AND ADMITTED THEM INTO THE ENTRY WHERE ONE
LIGHT ONLY WAS BURNING IN A BRANCH LAMP
SHALL WE GO UPSTAIRS SAID
MRS
MORLAND
AND WHAT FOR WOULD YE GO UPSTAIRS SAID THE GIRL IN A
PERT TONE
IT'S ALL DARK THERE AND THERE'S NO PREPARATIONS
YE CAN
LAVE YOUR THINGS HERE A HANGING ON THE RACK
IT IS A PARTY YE'RE
EXPECTING BLESSED ARE THEM WHAT EXPECTS NOTHING
THE SANGUINE EDWARD MORLAND LOOKED RATHER BLANK AT THIS INTELLIGENCE
AND HIS SISTER WHISPERED TO HIM WE'LL GET OFF TO MRS
ST
LEONARD'S
AS SOON AS WE POSSIBLY CAN
WHEN DID YOU TELL THE COACHMAN TO COME FOR
US
AT HALF PAST TEN WAS THE BROTHER'S REPLY
OH EDWARD EDWARD SHE EXCLAIMED AND I DARE SAY HE WILL NOT BE
PUNCTUAL
HE MAY KEEP US HERE TILL ELEVEN
COURAGE MES ENFANTS SAID THEIR MOTHER ET PARLEZ PLUS
DOUCEMENT
THE GIRL THEN USHERED THEM INTO THE BACK PARLOR SAYING HERE'S THE
COMPANY
THE ROOM WAS LARGE AND GLOOMY
A CHECQUERED MAT COVERED THE FLOOR AND
ALL THE FURNITURE WAS ENCASED IN STRIPED CALICO COVERS AND THE LAMPS
MIRRORS ETC
CONCEALED UNDER GREEN GAUZE
THE FRONT PARLOR WAS
ENTIRELY DARK AND IN THE BACK APARTMENT WAS NO OTHER LIGHT THAN A
SHADED LAMP ON A LARGE CENTRE TABLE ROUND WHICH WAS ASSEMBLED A
CIRCLE OF CHILDREN OF ALL SIZES AND AGES
ON A BACKLESS CUSHIONLESS
SOFA SAT MRS
WATKINSON AND A YOUNG LADY WHOM SHE INTRODUCED AS HER
DAUGHTER JANE
AND MRS
MORLAND IN RETURN PRESENTED EDWARD AND
CAROLINE
WILL YOU TAKE THE ROCKING CHAIR MA'AM INQUIRED MRS
WATKINSON
MRS
MORLAND DECLINING THE OFFER THE HOSTESS TOOK IT HERSELF AND
SEE SAWED ON IT NEARLY THE WHOLE TIME
IT WAS A VERY AWKWARD
HIGH LEGGED CROUCH BACKED ROCKING CHAIR AND SHAMEFULLY UNPROVIDED
WITH ANYTHING IN THE FORM OF A FOOTSTOOL
MY HUSBAND IS AWAY AT BOSTON ON BUSINESS SAID MRS
WATKINSON
I
THOUGHT AT FIRST MA'AM I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ASK YOU HERE THIS
EVENING FOR IT IS NOT OUR WAY TO HAVE COMPANY IN HIS ABSENCE BUT MY
DAUGHTER JANE OVER PERSUADED ME TO SEND FOR YOU
WHAT A PITY THOUGHT CAROLINE
YOU MUST TAKE US AS YOU FIND US MA'AM CONTINUED MRS
WATKINSON
WE USE NO CEREMONY WITH ANYBODY AND OUR RULE IS NEVER TO PUT
OURSELVES OUT OF THE WAY
WE DO NOT GIVE PARTIES LOOKING AT THE
DRESSES OF THE LADIES
OUR FIRST DUTY IS TO OUR CHILDREN AND WE
CANNOT WASTE OUR SUBSTANCE ON FASHION AND FOLLY
THEY'LL HAVE CAUSE TO
THANK US FOR IT WHEN WE DIE
SOMETHING LIKE A SOB WAS HEARD FROM THE CENTRE TABLE AT WHICH THE
CHILDREN WERE SITTING AND A BOY WAS SEEN TO HOLD HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO
HIS FACE
JOSEPH MY CHILD SAID HIS MOTHER DO NOT CRY
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
MA'AM WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY BOY THAT IS
YOU SEE HOW THE BARE MENTION
OF SUCH A THING AS OUR DEATHS HAS OVERCOME HIM
THERE WAS ANOTHER SOB BEHIND THE HANDKERCHIEF AND THE MORLANDS
THOUGHT IT NOW SOUNDED VERY MUCH LIKE A SMOTHERED LAUGH
AS I WAS SAYING MA'AM CONTINUED MRS
WATKINSON WE NEVER GIVE
PARTIES
WE LEAVE ALL SINFUL THINGS TO THE VAIN AND FOOLISH
MY
DAUGHTER JANE HAS BEEN TELLING ME THAT SHE HEARD THIS MORNING OF A
PARTY THAT IS GOING ON TONIGHT AT THE WIDOW ST
LEONARD'S
IT IS ONLY
FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE HER HUSBAND DIED
HE WAS CARRIED OFF WITH A THREE
DAYS' ILLNESS BUT TWO MONTHS AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED
I HAVE HAD A
DOMESTIC THAT LIVED WITH THEM AT THE TIME SO I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
AND
THERE SHE IS NOW LIVING IN AN ELEGANT HOUSE AND RIDING IN HER
CARRIAGE AND DRESSING AND DASHING AND GIVING PARTIES AND ENJOYING
LIFE AS SHE CALLS IT
POOR CREATURE HOW I PITY HER THANK HEAVEN
NOBODY THAT I KNOW GOES TO HER PARTIES
IF THEY DID I WOULD NEVER WISH
TO SEE THEM AGAIN IN MY HOUSE
IT IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO FOLLY AND
NONSENSE AND FOLLY AND NONSENSE ARE SINFUL
DO NOT YOU THINK SO
MA'AM
IF CARRIED TOO FAR THEY MAY CERTAINLY BECOME SO REPLIED MRS
MORLAND
WE HAVE HEARD SAID EDWARD THAT MRS
ST
LEONARD THOUGH ONE OF
THE ORNAMENTS OF THE GAY WORLD HAS A KIND HEART A BENEFICENT SPIRIT
AND A LIBERAL HAND
I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT HER REPLIED MRS
WATKINSON DRAWING UP HER
HEAD AND I HAVE NOT THE LEAST DESIRE TO KNOW ANY MORE
IT IS WELL
SHE HAS NO CHILDREN THEY'D BE LOST SHEEP IF BROUGHT UP IN HER FOLD
FOR MY PART MA'AM SHE CONTINUED TURNING TO MRS
MORLAND I AM
QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE QUIET JOYS OF A HAPPY HOME
AND NO MOTHER HAS
THE LEAST BUSINESS WITH ANY OTHER PLEASURES
MY INNOCENT BABES KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT PLAYS AND BALLS AND PARTIES AND THEY NEVER SHALL
DO
THEY LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO A LIFE OF PLEASURE
THEY CERTAINLY DID NOT FOR WHEN THE MORLANDS TOOK A GLANCE AT THEM
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN YOUTHFUL FACES THAT WERE LESS GAY
AND INDEED LESS PREPOSSESSING
THERE WAS NOT A GOOD FEATURE OR A PLEASANT EXPRESSION AMONG THEM ALL
EDWARD MORLAND RECOLLECTED HIS HAVING OFTEN READ THAT CHILDHOOD IS
ALWAYS LOVELY BUT HE SAW THAT THE JUVENILE WATKINSONS WERE AN
EXCEPTION TO THE RULE
THE FIRST DUTY OF A MOTHER IS TO HER CHILDREN REPEATED MRS
WATKINSON
TILL NINE O'CLOCK MY DAUGHTER JANE AND MYSELF ARE
OCCUPIED EVERY EVENING IN HEARING THE LESSONS THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED
FOR TO MORROW'S SCHOOL
BEFORE THAT HOUR WE CAN RECEIVE NO VISITORS
AND WE NEVER HAVE COMPANY TO TEA AS THAT WOULD INTERFERE TOO MUCH
WITH OUR DUTIES
WE HAD JUST FINISHED HEARING THESE LESSONS WHEN YOU
ARRIVED
AFTERWARDS THE CHILDREN ARE PERMITTED TO INDULGE THEMSELVES
IN RATIONAL PLAY FOR I PERMIT NO AMUSEMENT THAT IS NOT ALSO
INSTRUCTIVE
MY CHILDREN ARE SO WELL TRAINED THAT EVEN WHEN ALONE
THEIR SPORTS ARE ALWAYS SERIOUS
TWO OF THE BOYS GLANCED SLYLY AT EACH OTHER WITH WHAT EDWARD MORLAND
COMPREHENDED AS AN EXPRESSION OF PITCH PENNY AND MARBLES
THEY ARE NOW ENGAGED AT THEIR GAME OF ASTRONOMY CONTINUED MRS
WATKINSON
THEY HAVE ALSO A SORT OF GEOGRAPHY CARDS AND A SET OF
MATHEMATICAL CARDS
IT IS A BLESSED DISCOVERY THE INVENTION OF THESE
EDUCATIONARY GAMES SO THAT EVEN THE PLAY TIME OF CHILDREN CAN BE
TURNED TO ACCOUNT
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA MA'AM HOW THEY ENJOY THEM
JUST THEN THE BOY JOSEPH ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND STALKING UP TO MRS
WATKINSON SAID TO HER MAMMA PLEASE TO WHIP ME
AT THIS UNUSUAL REQUEST THE VISITORS LOOKED MUCH AMAZED AND MRS
WATKINSON REPLIED TO HIM WHIP YOU MY BEST JOSEPH FOR WHAT CAUSE I
HAVE NOT SEEN YOU DO ANYTHING WRONG THIS EVENING AND YOU KNOW MY
ANXIETY INDUCES ME TO WATCH MY CHILDREN ALL THE TIME
YOU COULD NOT SEE ME ANSWERED JOSEPH FOR I HAVE NOT DONE
ANYTHING VERY WRONG
BUT I HAVE HAD A BAD THOUGHT AND YOU KNOW MR
IRONRULE SAYS THAT A FAULT IMAGINED IS JUST AS WICKED AS A FAULT
COMMITTED
YOU SEE MA'AM WHAT A GOOD MEMORY HE HAS SAID MRS
WATKINSON ASIDE
TO MRS
MORLAND
BUT MY BEST JOSEPH YOU MAKE YOUR MOTHER TREMBLE
WHAT FAULT HAVE YOU IMAGINED WHAT WAS YOUR BAD THOUGHT
AY SAID ANOTHER BOY WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT LIKE
MY THOUGHT SAID JOSEPH WAS 'CONFOUND ALL ASTRONOMY AND I COULD
SEE THE MAN HANGED THAT MADE THIS GAME
OH MY CHILD EXCLAIMED THE MOTHER STOPPING HER EARS I AM INDEED
SHOCKED
I AM GLAD YOU REPENTED SO IMMEDIATELY
YES RETURNED JOSEPH BUT I AM AFRAID MY REPENTANCE WON'T LAST
IF
I AM NOT WHIPPED I MAY HAVE THESE BAD THOUGHTS WHENEVER I PLAY AT
ASTRONOMY AND WORSE STILL AT THE GEOGRAPHY GAME
WHIP ME MA AND
PUNISH ME AS I DESERVE
THERE'S THE RATTAN IN THE CORNER I'LL BRING
IT TO YOU MYSELF
EXCELLENT BOY SAID HIS MOTHER
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS PARDON MY
CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE SO CANDID AS TO CONFESS THEIR FAULTS
SO YOU DO SAID JOSEPH BUT A WHIPPING WILL CURE ME BETTER
I CANNOT RESOLVE TO PUNISH SO CONSCIENTIOUS A CHILD SAID MRS
WATKINSON
SHALL I TAKE THE TROUBLE OFF YOUR HANDS INQUIRED EDWARD LOSING ALL
PATIENCE IN HIS DISGUST AT THE SANCTIMONIOUS HYPOCRISY OF THIS YOUNG
BLIFIL
IT IS SUCH A RARITY FOR A BOY TO REQUEST A WHIPPING THAT SO
REMARKABLE A DESIRE OUGHT BY ALL MEANS TO BE GRATIFIED
JOSEPH TURNED ROUND AND MADE A FACE AT HIM
GIVE ME THE RATTAN SAID EDWARD HALF LAUGHING AND OFFERING TO TAKE
IT OUT OF HIS HAND
I'LL USE IT TO YOUR FULL SATISFACTION
THE BOY THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO STRIDE OFF AND RETURN TO THE TABLE
AND ENSCONCE HIMSELF AMONG HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS SOME OF WHOM WERE
STARING WITH STUPID SURPRISE OTHERS WERE WHISPERING AND GIGGLING IN
THE HOPE OF SEEING JOSEPH GET A REAL FLOGGING
MRS
WATKINSON HAVING BESTOWED A BITTER LOOK ON EDWARD HASTENED TO
TURN THE ATTENTION OF HIS MOTHER TO SOMETHING ELSE
MRS
MORLAND
SAID SHE ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY YOUNGEST HOPE SHE POINTED
TO A SLEEPY BOY ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD WHO WITH HEAD THROWN BACK AND
MOUTH WIDE OPEN WAS SLUMBERING IN HIS CHAIR
MRS
WATKINSON'S CHILDREN WERE OF THAT UNCOMFORTABLE SPECIES WHO NEVER
GO TO BED AT LEAST NEVER WITHOUT ALL MANNER OF RESISTANCE
ALL HER
BOASTED AUTHORITY WAS INADEQUATE TO COMPEL THEM THEY NEVER WOULD
CONFESS THEMSELVES SLEEPY ALWAYS WANTED TO SIT UP AND THERE WAS A
NIGHTLY SCENE OF SCOLDING COAXING THREATENING AND MANOEUVRING TO GET
THEM OFF
I DECLARE SAID MRS
WATKINSON DEAR BENNY IS ALMOST ASLEEP
SHAKE
HIM UP CHRISTOPHER
I WANT HIM TO SPEAK A SPEECH
HIS SCHOOL MISTRESS
TAKES GREAT PAINS IN TEACHING HER LITTLE PUPILS TO SPEAK AND STANDS
UP HERSELF AND SHOWS THEM HOW
THE CHILD HAVING BEEN SHAKEN UP HARD TWO OR THREE OTHERS HELPING
CHRISTOPHER RUBBED HIS EYES AND BEGAN TO WHINE
HIS MOTHER WENT TO
HIM TOOK HIM ON HER LAP HUSHED HIM UP AND BEGAN TO COAX HIM
THIS
DONE SHE STOOD HIM ON HIS FEET BEFORE MRS
MORLAND AND DESIRED HIM
TO SPEAK A SPEECH FOR THE COMPANY
THE CHILD PUT HIS THUMB INTO HIS
MOUTH AND REMAINED SILENT
MA SAID JANE WATKINSON YOU HAD BETTER TELL HIM WHAT SPEECH TO
SPEAK
SPEAK CATO OR PLATO SAID HIS MOTHER
WHICH DO YOU CALL IT COME
NOW BENNY HOW DOES IT BEGIN 'YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT AND REASONABLE
PLATO THAT'S IT
SPEAK LUCIUS SAID HIS SISTER JANE
COME NOW BENNY SAY 'YOUR
THOUGHTS ARE TURNED ON PEACE
THE LITTLE BOY LOOKED VERY MUCH AS IF THEY WERE NOT AND AS IF
MEDITATING AN OUTBREAK
NO NO EXCLAIMED CHRISTOPHER LET HIM SAY HAMLET
COME NOW
BENNY 'TO BE OR NOT TO BE
IT AIN'T TO BE AT ALL CRIED BENNY AND I WON'T SPEAK THE LEAST BIT
OF IT FOR ANY OF YOU
I HATE THAT SPEECH
ONLY SEE HIS OBSTINACY SAID THE SOLEMN JOSEPH
AND IS HE TO BE
GIVEN UP TO
SPEAK ANYTHING BENNY SAID MRS
WATKINSON ANYTHING SO THAT IT IS
ONLY A SPEECH
ALL THE WATKINSON VOICES NOW BEGAN TO CLAMOR VIOLENTLY AT THE
OBSTINATE CHILD SPEAK A SPEECH SPEAK A SPEECH SPEAK A SPEECH BUT
THEY HAD NO MORE EFFECT THAN THE REITERATED EXHORTATIONS WITH WHICH
NURSES CONFUSE THE POOR HEADS OF BABIES WHEN THEY REQUIRE THEM TO
SHAKE A DAY DAY SHAKE A DAY DAY
MRS
MORLAND NOW INTERFERED AND BEGGED THAT THE SLEEPY LITTLE BOY
MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON WHICH HE SCREAMED OUT THAT HE WASN'T SLEEPY AT
ALL AND WOULD NOT GO TO BED EVER
I NEVER KNEW ANY OF MY CHILDREN BEHAVE SO BEFORE SAID MRS
WATKINSON
THEY ARE ALWAYS MODELS OF OBEDIENCE MA'AM
A LOOK IS
SUFFICIENT FOR THEM
AND I MUST SAY THAT THEY HAVE IN EVERY WAY
PROFITED BY THE EDUCATION WE ARE GIVING THEM
IT IS NOT OUR WAY
MA'AM TO WASTE OUR MONEY IN PARTIES AND FOOLERIES AND FINE FURNITURE
AND FINE CLOTHES AND RICH FOOD AND ALL SUCH ABOMINATIONS
OUR FIRST
DUTY IS TO OUR CHILDREN AND TO MAKE THEM LEARN EVERYTHING THAT IS
TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS
IF THEY GO WRONG IT WILL NOT BE FOR WANT OF
EDUCATION
HESTER MY DEAR COME AND TALK TO MISS MORLAND IN FRENCH
HESTER UNLIKE HER LITTLE BROTHER THAT WOULD NOT SPEAK A SPEECH
STEPPED BOLDLY FORWARD AND ADDRESSED CAROLINE MORLAND WITH
PARLEZ VOUS FRANAIS MADEMOISELLE COMMENT SE VA MADAME VOTRE MRE
AIMEZ VOUS LA MUSIQUE AIMEZ VOUS LA DANSE BON JOUR BON SOIR BON
REPOS
COMPRENEZ VOUS
TO THIS TIRADE UTTERED WITH GREAT VOLUBILITY MISS MORLAND MADE NO
OTHER REPLY THAN OUI JE COMPRENS
VERY WELL HESTER VERY WELL INDEED SAID MRS
WATKINSON
YOU SEE
MA'AM TURNING TO MRS
MORLAND HOW VERY FLUENT SHE IS IN FRENCH
AND SHE HAS ONLY BEEN LEARNING ELEVEN QUARTERS
AFTER CONSIDERABLE WHISPERING BETWEEN JANE AND HER MOTHER THE FORMER
WITHDREW AND SENT IN BY THE IRISH GIRL A WAITER WITH A BASKET OF SODA
BISCUIT A PITCHER OF WATER AND SOME GLASSES
MRS
WATKINSON INVITED
HER GUESTS TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AT HOME AND HELP THEMSELVES FREELY
SAYING WE NEVER LET CAKES SWEETMEATS CONFECTIONERY OR ANY SUCH
THINGS ENTER THE HOUSE AS THEY WOULD BE VERY UNWHOLESOME FOR THE
CHILDREN AND IT WOULD BE SINFUL TO PUT TEMPTATION IN THEIR WAY
I AM
SURE MA'AM YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT THE PLAINEST FOOD IS THE BEST
FOR EVERYBODY
PEOPLE THAT WANT NICE THINGS MAY GO TO PARTIES FOR
THEM BUT THEY WILL NEVER GET ANY WITH ME
WHEN THE COLLATION WAS OVER AND EVERY CHILD PROVIDED WITH A BISCUIT
MRS
WATKINSON SAID TO MRS
MORLAND NOW MA'AM YOU SHALL HAVE SOME
MUSIC FROM MY DAUGHTER JANE WHO IS ONE OF MR
BANGWHANGER'S BEST
SCHOLARS
JANE WATKINSON SAT DOWN TO THE PIANO AND COMMENCED A POWERFUL PIECE OF
SIX MORTAL PAGES WHICH SHE PLAYED OUT OF TIME AND OUT OF TUNE BUT
WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE OF HANDS NOTWITHSTANDING WHICH IT HAD
HOWEVER THE GOOD EFFECT OF PUTTING MOST OF THE CHILDREN TO SLEEP
TO THE MORLANDS THE EVENING HAD SEEMED ALREADY FIVE HOURS LONG
STILL
IT WAS ONLY HALF PAST TEN WHEN JANE WAS IN THE MIDST OF HER PIECE
THE
GUESTS HAD ALL TACITLY DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST NOT TO LET
MRS
WATKINSON KNOW THEIR INTENTION TO GO DIRECTLY FROM HER HOUSE TO
MRS
ST
LEONARD'S PARTY AND THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR CARRIAGE WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE SIGNAL OF DEPARTURE EVEN IF JANE'S PIECE HAD NOT REACHED ITS
TERMINATION
THEY STOLE GLANCES AT THE CLOCK ON THE MANTEL
IT WANTED
BUT A QUARTER OF ELEVEN WHEN JANE ROSE FROM THE PIANO AND WAS
CONGRATULATED BY HER MOTHER ON THE EXCELLENCE OF HER MUSIC
STILL NO
CARRIAGE WAS HEARD TO STOP NO DOORBELL WAS HEARD TO RING
MRS
MORLAND EXPRESSED HER FEARS THAT THE COACHMAN HAD FORGOTTEN TO COME
FOR THEM
HAS HE BEEN PAID FOR BRINGING YOU HERE ASKED MRS
WATKINSON
I PAID HIM WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR SAID EDWARD
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
HE MIGHT WANT THE MONEY FOR SOME PURPOSE BEFORE HE CAME FOR US
THAT WAS VERY KIND IN YOU SIR SAID MRS
WATKINSON BUT NOT VERY
WISE
THERE'S NO DEPENDENCE ON ANY COACHMAN AND PERHAPS AS HE MAY BE
SURE OF BUSINESS ENOUGH THIS RAINY NIGHT HE MAY NEVER COME AT
ALL BEING ALREADY PAID FOR BRINGING YOU HERE
NOW THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE COACHMAN HAD COME AT THE APPOINTED TIME
BUT THE NOISE OF JANE'S PIANO HAD PREVENTED HIS ARRIVAL BEING HEARD IN
THE BACK PARLOR
THE IRISH GIRL HAD GONE TO THE DOOR WHEN HE RANG THE
BELL AND RECOGNIZED IN HIM WHAT SHE CALLED AN OULD FRIEND JUST
THEN A LADY AND GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN THE RAIN CAME RUNNING
ALONG AND SEEING A CARRIAGE DRAWING UP AT A DOOR THE GENTLEMAN
INQUIRED OF THE DRIVER IF HE COULD NOT TAKE THEM TO RUTGERS PLACE
THE
DRIVER REPLIED THAT HE HAD JUST COME FOR TWO LADIES AND A GENTLEMAN
WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT FROM THE ASTOR HOUSE
INDEED AND PATRICK SAID THE GIRL WHO STOOD AT THE DOOR IF I WAS
YOU I'D BE AFTER MAKING ANOTHER PENNY TO NIGHT
MISS JANE IS POUNDING
AWAY AT ONE OF HER LONG MUSIC PIECES AND IT WON'T BE OVER BEFORE YOU
HAVE TIME TO GET TO RUTGERS AND BACK AGAIN
AND IF YOU DO MAKE THEM
WAIT AWHILE WHERE'S THE HARM THEY'VE A DRY ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS
AND I WARRANT IT'S NOT THE FIRST WAITING THEY'VE EVER HAD IN THEIR
LIVES AND IT WON'T BE THE LAST NEITHER
EXACTLY SO SAID THE GENTLEMAN AND REGARDLESS OF THE PROPRIETY OF
FIRST SENDING TO CONSULT THE PERSONS WHO HAD ENGAGED THE CARRIAGE HE
TOLD HIS WIFE TO STEP IN AND FOLLOWING HER INSTANTLY HIMSELF THEY
DROVE AWAY TO RUTGERS PLACE
READER IF YOU WERE EVER DETAINED IN A STRANGE HOUSE BY THE
NON ARRIVAL OF YOUR CARRIAGE YOU WILL EASILY UNDERSTAND THE EXCESSIVE
ANNOYANCE OF FINDING THAT YOU ARE KEEPING A FAMILY OUT OF THEIR BEDS
BEYOND THEIR USUAL HOUR
AND IN THIS CASE THERE WAS A DOUBLE
GRIEVANCE THE GUESTS BEING ALL IMPATIENCE TO GET OFF TO A BETTER
PLACE
THE CHILDREN ALL CRYING WHEN WAKENED FROM THEIR SLEEP WERE
FINALLY TAKEN TO BED BY TWO SERVANT MAIDS AND JANE WATKINSON WHO
NEVER CAME BACK AGAIN
NONE WERE LEFT BUT HESTER THE GREAT FRENCH
SCHOLAR WHO BEING ONE OF THOSE YOUNG IMPS THAT SEEM TO HAVE THE
FACULTY OF LIVING WITHOUT SLEEP SAT BOLT UPRIGHT WITH HER EYES WIDE
OPEN WATCHING THE UNCOMFORTABLE VISITORS
THE MORLANDS FELT AS IF THEY COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND EDWARD
PROPOSED SENDING FOR ANOTHER CARRIAGE TO THE NEAREST LIVERY STABLE
WE DON'T KEEP A MAN NOW SAID MRS
WATKINSON WHO SAT NODDING IN THE
ROCKING CHAIR ATTEMPTING NOW AND THEN A SNATCH OF CONVERSATION AND
SAYING MA'AM STILL MORE FREQUENTLY THAN USUAL
MEN SERVANTS ARE
DREADFUL TRIALS MA'AM AND WE GAVE THEM UP THREE YEARS AGO
AND I
DON'T KNOW HOW MARY OR KATY ARE TO GO OUT THIS STORMY NIGHT IN SEARCH
OF A LIVERY STABLE
ON NO CONSIDERATION COULD I ALLOW THE WOMEN TO DO SO REPLIED
EDWARD
IF YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY THE LOAN OF AN UMBRELLA I WILL GO
MYSELF
ACCORDINGLY HE SET OUT ON THIS BUSINESS BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AT TWO
LIVERY STABLES THE CARRIAGES BEING ALL OUT
AT LAST HE FOUND ONE AND
WAS DRIVEN IN IT TO MR
WATKINSON'S HOUSE WHERE HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
WERE AWAITING HIM ALL QUITE READY WITH THEIR CALASHES AND SHAWLS ON
THEY GLADLY TOOK THEIR LEAVE MRS
WATKINSON ROUSING HERSELF TO HOPE
THEY HAD SPENT A PLEASANT EVENING AND THAT THEY WOULD COME AND PASS
ANOTHER WITH HER ON THEIR RETURN TO NEW YORK
IN SUCH CASES HOW
DIFFICULT IT IS TO REPLY EVEN WITH WHAT ARE CALLED WORDS OF COURSE
A KITCHEN LAMP WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT THEM TO THE DOOR THE ENTRY LAMP
HAVING LONG SINCE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
FORTUNATELY THE RAIN HAD CEASED
THE STARS BEGAN TO REAPPEAR AND THE MORLANDS WHEN THEY FOUND
THEMSELVES IN THE CARRIAGE AND ON THEIR WAY TO MRS
ST
LEONARD'S
FELT AS IF THEY COULD BREATHE AGAIN
AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY FREELY
DISCUSSED THE ANNOYANCES OF THE EVENING BUT NOW THOSE TROUBLES WERE
OVER THEY FELT RATHER INCLINED TO BE MERRY ABOUT THEM
DEAR MOTHER SAID EDWARD HOW I PITIED YOU FOR HAVING TO ENDURE
MRS
WATKINSON'S PERPETUAL 'MA'AMING' AND 'MA'AMING' FOR I KNOW YOU
DISLIKE THE WORD
I WISH SAID CAROLINE I WAS NOT SO PRONE TO BE TAKEN WITH
RIDICULOUS RECOLLECTIONS
BUT REALLY TO NIGHT I COULD NOT GET THAT OLD
FOOLISH CHILD'S PLAY OUT OF MY HEAD
HERE COME THREE KNIGHTS OUT OF SPAIN
A COURTING OF YOUR DAUGHTER JANE
I SHALL CERTAINLY NEVER BE ONE OF THOSE SPANISH KNIGHTS SAID
EDWARD
HER DAUGHTER JANE IS IN NO DANGER OF BEING RULED BY ANY
'FLATTERING TONGUE' OF MINE
BUT WHAT A SHAME FOR US TO BE TALKING OF
THEM IN THIS MANNER
THEY DROVE TO MRS
ST
LEONARD'S HOPING TO BE YET IN TIME TO PASS
HALF AN HOUR THERE THOUGH IT WAS NOW NEAR TWELVE O'CLOCK AND SUMMER
PARTIES NEVER CONTINUE TO A VERY LATE HOUR
BUT AS THEY CAME INTO THE
STREET IN WHICH SHE LIVED THEY WERE MET BY A NUMBER OF COACHES ON
THEIR WAY HOME AND ON REACHING THE DOOR OF HER BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED
MANSION THEY SAW THE LAST OF THE GUESTS DRIVING OFF IN THE LAST OF
THE CARRIAGES AND SEVERAL MUSICIANS COMING DOWN THE STEPS WITH THEIR
INSTRUMENTS IN THEIR HANDS
SO THERE HAS BEEN A DANCE THEN SIGHED CAROLINE
OH WHAT WE
HAVE MISSED IT IS REALLY TOO PROVOKING
SO IT IS SAID EDWARD BUT REMEMBER THAT TO MORROW MORNING WE SET
OFF FOR NIAGARA
I WILL LEAVE A NOTE FOR MRS
ST
LEONARD SAID HIS MOTHER
EXPLAINING THAT WE WERE DETAINED AT MRS
WATKINSON'S BY OUR COACHMAN
DISAPPOINTING US
LET US CONSOLE OURSELVES WITH THE HOPE OF SEEING
MORE OF THIS LADY ON OUR RETURN
AND NOW DEAR CAROLINE YOU MUST DRAW
A MORAL FROM THE UNTOWARD EVENTS OF TO DAY
WHEN YOU ARE MISTRESS OF A
HOUSE AND WISH TO SHOW CIVILITY TO STRANGERS LET THE INVITATION BE
ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED WITH A FRANK DISCLOSURE OF WHAT THEY ARE TO EXPECT
AND IF YOU CANNOT CONVENIENTLY INVITE COMPANY TO MEET THEM TELL THEM
AT ONCE THAT YOU WILL NOT INSIST ON THEIR KEEPING THEIR ENGAGEMENT
WITH YOU IF ANYTHING OFFERS AFTERWARDS THAT THEY THINK THEY WOULD
PREFER PROVIDED ONLY THAT THEY APPRIZE YOU IN TIME OF THE CHANGE IN
THEIR PLAN
OH MAMMA REPLIED CAROLINE YOU MAY BE SURE I SHALL ALWAYS TAKE
CARE NOT TO BETRAY MY VISITORS INTO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH THEY MAY HAVE
CAUSE TO REGRET PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE STRANGERS WHOSE TIME IS
LIMITED
I SHALL CERTAINLY AS YOU SAY TELL THEM NOT TO CONSIDER
THEMSELVES BOUND TO ME IF THEY AFTERWARDS RECEIVE AN INVITATION WHICH
PROMISES THEM MORE ENJOYMENT
IT WILL BE A LONG WHILE BEFORE I FORGET
THE WATKINSON EVENING
TITBOTTOM'S SPECTACLES
BY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS 1824 1892
FROM PUTNAM'S MONTHLY DECEMBER 1854
REPUBLISHED IN THE VOLUME
PRUE AND I 1856 BY GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS HARPER BROTHERS
IN MY MIND'S EYE HORATIO
PRUE AND I DO NOT ENTERTAIN MUCH OUR MEANS FORBID IT
IN TRUTH OTHER
PEOPLE ENTERTAIN FOR US
WE ENJOY THAT HOSPITALITY OF WHICH NO ACCOUNT
IS MADE
WE SEE THE SHOW AND HEAR THE MUSIC AND SMELL THE FLOWERS OF
GREAT FESTIVITIES TASTING AS IT WERE THE DRIPPINGS FROM RICH DISHES
OUR OWN DINNER SERVICE IS REMARKABLY PLAIN OUR DINNERS EVEN ON STATE
OCCASIONS ARE STRICTLY IN KEEPING AND ALMOST OUR ONLY GUEST IS
TITBOTTOM
I BUY A HANDFUL OF ROSES AS I COME UP FROM THE OFFICE
PERHAPS AND PRUE ARRANGES THEM SO PRETTILY IN A GLASS DISH FOR THE
CENTRE OF THE TABLE THAT EVEN WHEN I HAVE HURRIED OUT TO SEE AURELIA
STEP INTO HER CARRIAGE TO GO OUT TO DINE I HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE
BOUQUET SHE CARRIED WAS NOT MORE BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE IT WAS MORE COSTLY
I GRANT THAT IT WAS MORE HARMONIOUS WITH HER SUPERB BEAUTY AND HER
RICH ATTIRE
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IF AURELIA KNEW THE OLD MAN
WHOM SHE MUST HAVE SEEN SO OFTEN WATCHING HER AND HIS WIFE WHO
ORNAMENTS HER SEX WITH AS MUCH SWEETNESS ALTHOUGH WITH LESS SPLENDOR
THAN AURELIA HERSELF SHE WOULD ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE NOSEGAY OF
ROSES WAS AS FINE AND FIT UPON THEIR TABLE AS HER OWN SUMPTUOUS
BOUQUET IS FOR HERSELF
I HAVE THAT FAITH IN THE PERCEPTION OF THAT
LOVELY LADY
IT IS AT LEAST MY HABIT I HOPE I MAY SAY MY NATURE TO
BELIEVE THE BEST OF PEOPLE RATHER THAN THE WORST
IF I THOUGHT THAT
ALL THIS SPARKLING SETTING OF BEAUTY THIS FINE FASHION THESE BLAZING
JEWELS AND LUSTROUS SILKS AND AIRY GAUZES EMBELLISHED WITH
GOLD THREADED EMBROIDERY AND WROUGHT IN A THOUSAND EXQUISITE
ELABORATIONS SO THAT I CANNOT SEE ONE OF THOSE LOVELY GIRLS PASS ME
BY WITHOUT THANKING GOD FOR THE VISION IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS
ALL AND THAT UNDERNEATH HER LACE FLOUNCES AND DIAMOND BRACELETS
AURELIA WAS A SULLEN SELFISH WOMAN THEN I SHOULD TURN SADLY
HOMEWARDS FOR I SHOULD SEE THAT HER JEWELS WERE FLASHING SCORN UPON
THE OBJECT THEY ADORNED AND THAT HER LACES WERE OF A MORE EXQUISITE
LOVELINESS THAN THE WOMAN WHOM THEY MERELY TOUCHED WITH A SUPERFICIAL
GRACE
IT WOULD BE LIKE A GAILY DECORATED MAUSOLEUM BRIGHT TO SEE
BUT SILENT AND DARK WITHIN
GREAT EXCELLENCES MY DEAR PRUE I SOMETIMES ALLOW MYSELF TO SAY
LIE CONCEALED IN THE DEPTHS OF CHARACTER LIKE PEARLS AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA
UNDER THE LAUGHING GLANCING SURFACE HOW LITTLE THEY ARE
SUSPECTED PERHAPS LOVE IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE SIGHT OF THEM BY ONE
PERSON
HENCE EVERY MAN'S MISTRESS IS APT TO BE AN ENIGMA TO EVERYBODY
ELSE
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WHEN AURELIA IS ENGAGED PEOPLE WILL SAY
THAT SHE IS A MOST ADMIRABLE GIRL CERTAINLY BUT THEY CANNOT
UNDERSTAND WHY ANY MAN SHOULD BE IN LOVE WITH HER
AS IF IT WERE AT
ALL NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD AND HER LOVER LIKE A BOY WHO FINDS A
PEARL IN THE PUBLIC STREET AND WONDERS AS MUCH THAT OTHERS DID NOT
SEE IT AS THAT HE DID WILL TREMBLE UNTIL HE KNOWS HIS PASSION IS
RETURNED FEELING OF COURSE THAT THE WHOLE WORLD MUST BE IN LOVE
WITH THIS PARAGON WHO CANNOT POSSIBLY SMILE UPON ANYTHING SO UNWORTHY
AS HE
I HOPE THEREFORE MY DEAR MRS
PRUE I CONTINUE TO SAY TO MY WIFE
WHO LOOKS UP FROM HER WORK REGARDING ME WITH PLEASED PRIDE AS IF I
WERE SUCH AN IRRESISTIBLE HUMORIST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO BELIEVE THAT
THE DEPTH MAY BE CALM ALTHOUGH THE SURFACE IS DANCING
IF YOU TELL ME
THAT AURELIA IS BUT A GIDDY GIRL I SHALL BELIEVE THAT YOU THINK SO
BUT I SHALL KNOW ALL THE WHILE WHAT PROFOUND DIGNITY AND SWEETNESS
AND PEACE LIE AT THE FOUNDATION OF HER CHARACTER
I SAY SUCH THINGS TO TITBOTTOM DURING THE DULL SEASON AT THE OFFICE
AND I HAVE KNOWN HIM SOMETIMES TO REPLY WITH A KIND OF DRY SAD HUMOR
NOT AS IF HE ENJOYED THE JOKE BUT AS IF THE JOKE MUST BE MADE THAT
HE SAW NO REASON WHY I SHOULD BE DULL BECAUSE THE SEASON WAS SO
AND WHAT DO I KNOW OF AURELIA OR ANY OTHER GIRL HE SAYS TO ME WITH
THAT ABSTRACTED AIR
I WHOSE AURELIAS WERE OF ANOTHER CENTURY AND
ANOTHER ZONE
THEN HE FALLS INTO A SILENCE WHICH IT SEEMS QUITE PROFANE TO
INTERRUPT
BUT AS WE SIT UPON OUR HIGH STOOLS AT THE DESK OPPOSITE
EACH OTHER I LEANING UPON MY ELBOWS AND LOOKING AT HIM HE WITH
SIDELONG FACE GLANCING OUT OF THE WINDOW AS IF IT COMMANDED A
BOUNDLESS LANDSCAPE INSTEAD OF A DIM DINGY OFFICE COURT I CANNOT
REFRAIN FROM SAYING
WELL
HE TURNS SLOWLY AND I GO CHATTING ON A LITTLE TOO LOQUACIOUS
PERHAPS ABOUT THOSE YOUNG GIRLS
BUT I KNOW THAT TITBOTTOM REGARDS
SUCH AN EXCESS AS VENIAL FOR HIS SADNESS IS SO SWEET THAT YOU COULD
BELIEVE IT THE REFLECTION OF A SMILE FROM LONG LONG YEARS AGO
ONE DAY AFTER I HAD BEEN TALKING FOR A LONG TIME AND WE HAD PUT UP
OUR BOOKS AND WERE PREPARING TO LEAVE HE STOOD FOR SOME TIME BY THE
WINDOW GAZING WITH A DROOPING INTENTNESS AS IF HE REALLY SAW
SOMETHING MORE THAN THE DARK COURT AND SAID SLOWLY
PERHAPS YOU WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS OF THINGS IF YOU SAW
THEM THROUGH MY SPECTACLES
THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN HIS EXPRESSION
HE STILL LOOKED FROM THE
WINDOW AND I SAID
TITBOTTOM I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU USED GLASSES
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
YOU WEARING SPECTACLES
NO I DON'T OFTEN WEAR THEM
I AM NOT VERY FOND OF LOOKING THROUGH
THEM
BUT SOMETIMES AN IRRESISTIBLE NECESSITY COMPELS ME TO PUT THEM
ON AND I CANNOT HELP SEEING TITBOTTOM SIGHED
IS IT SO GRIEVOUS A FATE TO SEE INQUIRED I
YES THROUGH MY SPECTACLES HE SAID TURNING SLOWLY AND LOOKING AT
ME WITH WAN SOLEMNITY
IT GREW DARK AS WE STOOD IN THE OFFICE TALKING AND TAKING OUR HATS WE
WENT OUT TOGETHER
THE NARROW STREET OF BUSINESS WAS DESERTED
THE
HEAVY IRON SHUTTERS WERE GLOOMILY CLOSED OVER THE WINDOWS
FROM ONE OR
TWO OFFICES STRUGGLED THE DIM GLEAM OF AN EARLY CANDLE BY WHOSE LIGHT
SOME PERPLEXED ACCOUNTANT SAT BELATED AND HUNTING FOR HIS ERROR
A
CARELESS CLERK PASSED WHISTLING
BUT THE GREAT TIDE OF LIFE HAD
EBBED
WE HEARD ITS ROAR FAR AWAY AND THE SOUND STOLE INTO THAT
SILENT STREET LIKE THE MURMUR OF THE OCEAN INTO AN INLAND DELL
YOU WILL COME AND DINE WITH US TITBOTTOM
HE ASSENTED BY CONTINUING TO WALK WITH ME AND I THINK WE WERE BOTH
GLAD WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE AND PRUE CAME TO MEET US SAYING
DO YOU KNOW I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING MR
TITBOTTOM TO DINE
TITBOTTOM SMILED GENTLY AND ANSWERED
HE MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT HIS SPECTACLES WITH HIM AND I HAVE BEEN A
HAPPIER MAN FOR IT
PRUE LOOKED A LITTLE PUZZLED
MY DEAR I SAID YOU MUST KNOW THAT OUR FRIEND MR
TITBOTTOM IS
THE HAPPY POSSESSOR OF A PAIR OF WONDERFUL SPECTACLES
I HAVE NEVER
SEEN THEM INDEED AND FROM WHAT HE SAYS I SHOULD BE RATHER AFRAID
OF BEING SEEN BY THEM
MOST SHORT SIGHTED PERSONS ARE VERY GLAD TO
HAVE THE HELP OF GLASSES BUT MR
TITBOTTOM SEEMS TO FIND VERY LITTLE
PLEASURE IN HIS
IT IS BECAUSE THEY MAKE HIM TOO FAR SIGHTED PERHAPS INTERRUPTED
PRUE QUIETLY AS SHE TOOK THE SILVER SOUP LADLE FROM THE SIDEBOARD
WE SIPPED OUR WINE AFTER DINNER AND PRUE TOOK HER WORK
CAN A MAN BE
TOO FAR SIGHTED I DID NOT ASK THE QUESTION ALOUD
THE VERY TONE IN
WHICH PRUE HAD SPOKEN CONVINCED ME THAT HE MIGHT
AT LEAST I SAID MR
TITBOTTOM WILL NOT REFUSE TO TELL US THE
HISTORY OF HIS MYSTERIOUS SPECTACLES
I HAVE KNOWN PLENTY OF MAGIC IN
EYES AND I GLANCED AT THE TENDER BLUE EYES OF PRUE BUT I HAVE NOT
HEARD OF ANY ENCHANTED GLASSES
YET YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE GLASS IN WHICH YOUR WIFE LOOKS EVERY
MORNING AND I TAKE IT THAT GLASS MUST BE DAILY ENCHANTED SAID
TITBOTTOM WITH A BOW OF QUAINT RESPECT TO MY WIFE
I DO NOT THINK I HAVE SEEN SUCH A BLUSH UPON PRUE'S CHEEK SINCE WELL
SINCE A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO
I WILL GLADLY TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF MY SPECTACLES BEGAN
TITBOTTOM
IT IS VERY SIMPLE AND I AM NOT AT ALL SURE THAT A GREAT
MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE NOT A PAIR OF THE SAME KIND
I HAVE NEVER
INDEED HEARD OF THEM BY THE GROSS LIKE THOSE OF OUR YOUNG FRIEND
MOSES THE SON OF THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD
IN FACT I THINK A GROSS
WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH TO SUPPLY THE WORLD
IT IS A KIND OF ARTICLE FOR
WHICH THE DEMAND DOES NOT INCREASE WITH USE
IF WE SHOULD ALL WEAR
SPECTACLES LIKE MINE WE SHOULD NEVER SMILE ANY MORE
OH I AM NOT
QUITE SURE WE SHOULD ALL BE VERY HAPPY
A VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE SAID PRUE COUNTING HER STITCHES
YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM WAS A WEST INDIAN
A LARGE
PROPRIETOR AND AN EASY MAN HE BASKED IN THE TROPICAL SUN LEADING
HIS QUIET LUXURIOUS LIFE
HE LIVED MUCH ALONE AND WAS WHAT PEOPLE
CALL ECCENTRIC BY WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH HIMSELF
AND REFUSING THE INFLUENCE OF OTHER PEOPLE THEY HAD THEIR LITTLE
REVENGES AND CALLED HIM NAMES
IT IS A HABIT NOT EXCLUSIVELY
TROPICAL
I THINK I HAVE SEEN THE SAME THING EVEN IN THIS CITY
BUT HE
WAS GREATLY BELOVED MY BLAND AND BOUNTIFUL GRANDFATHER
HE WAS SO
LARGE HEARTED AND OPEN HANDED
HE WAS SO FRIENDLY AND THOUGHTFUL AND
GENIAL THAT EVEN HIS JOKES HAD THE AIR OF GRACEFUL BENEDICTIONS
HE
DID NOT SEEM TO GROW OLD AND HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO NEVER APPEAR TO
HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG
HE FLOURISHED IN A PERENNIAL MATURITY AN
IMMORTAL MIDDLE AGE
MY GRANDFATHER LIVED UPON ONE OF THE SMALL ISLANDS ST
KIT'S
PERHAPS AND HIS DOMAIN EXTENDED TO THE SEA
HIS HOUSE A RAMBLING
WEST INDIAN MANSION WAS SURROUNDED WITH DEEP SPACIOUS PIAZZAS
COVERED WITH LUXURIOUS LOUNGES AMONG WHICH ONE CAPACIOUS CHAIR WAS
HIS PECULIAR SEAT
THEY TELL ME HE USED SOMETIMES TO SIT THERE FOR THE
WHOLE DAY HIS GREAT SOFT BROWN EYES FASTENED UPON THE SEA WATCHING
THE SPECKS OF SAILS THAT FLASHED UPON THE HORIZON WHILE THE
EVANESCENT EXPRESSIONS CHASED EACH OTHER OVER HIS PLACID FACE AS IF
IT REFLECTED THE CALM AND CHANGING SEA BEFORE HIM
HIS MORNING COSTUME
WAS AN AMPLE DRESSING GOWN OF GORGEOUSLY FLOWERED SILK AND HIS
MORNING WAS VERY APT TO LAST ALL DAY
HE RARELY READ BUT HE WOULD PACE THE GREAT PIAZZA FOR HOURS WITH
HIS HANDS SUNKEN IN THE POCKETS OF HIS DRESSING GOWN AND AN AIR OF
SWEET REVERIE WHICH ANY AUTHOR MIGHT BE VERY HAPPY TO PRODUCE
SOCIETY OF COURSE HE SAW LITTLE
THERE WAS SOME SLIGHT APPREHENSION
THAT IF HE WERE BIDDEN TO SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENTS HE MIGHT FORGET HIS
COAT OR ARRIVE WITHOUT SOME OTHER ESSENTIAL PART OF HIS DRESS AND
THERE IS A SLY TRADITION IN THE TITBOTTOM FAMILY THAT HAVING BEEN
INVITED TO A BALL IN HONOR OF THE NEW GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND MY
GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM SAUNTERED INTO THE HALL TOWARDS MIDNIGHT
WRAPPED IN THE GORGEOUS FLOWERS OF HIS DRESSING GOWN AND WITH HIS
HANDS BURIED IN THE POCKETS AS USUAL
THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AND
IMMENSE DEPRECATION OF GUBERNATORIAL IRE
BUT IT HAPPENED THAT THE
GOVERNOR AND MY GRANDFATHER WERE OLD FRIENDS AND THERE WAS NO
OFFENSE
BUT AS THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER ONE OF THE DISTRESSED
MANAGERS CAST INDIGNANT GLANCES AT THE BRILLIANT COSTUME OF MY
GRANDFATHER WHO SUMMONED HIM AND ASKED COURTEOUSLY
'DID YOU INVITE ME OR MY COAT
'YOU IN A PROPER COAT REPLIED THE MANAGER
THE GOVERNOR SMILED APPROVINGLY AND LOOKED AT MY GRANDFATHER
'MY FRIEND SAID HE TO THE MANAGER 'I BEG YOUR PARDON I FORGOT
THE NEXT DAY MY GRANDFATHER WAS SEEN PROMENADING IN FULL BALL DRESS
ALONG THE STREETS OF THE LITTLE TOWN
'THEY OUGHT TO KNOW SAID HE 'THAT I HAVE A PROPER COAT AND THAT
NOT CONTEMPT NOR POVERTY BUT FORGETFULNESS SENT ME TO A BALL IN MY
DRESSING GOWN
HE DID NOT MUCH FREQUENT SOCIAL FESTIVALS AFTER THIS FAILURE BUT HE
ALWAYS TOLD THE STORY WITH SATISFACTION AND A QUIET SMILE
TO A STRANGER LIFE UPON THOSE LITTLE ISLANDS IS UNIFORM EVEN TO
WEARINESS
BUT THE OLD NATIVE DONS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER RIPEN IN THE
PROLONGED SUNSHINE LIKE THE TURTLE UPON THE BAHAMA BANKS NOR KNOW OF
EXISTENCE MORE DESIRABLE
LIFE IN THE TROPICS I TAKE TO BE A PLACID
TORPIDITY
DURING THE LONG WARM MORNINGS OF NEARLY HALF A CENTURY MY
GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM HAD SAT IN HIS DRESSING GOWN AND GAZED AT THE
SEA
BUT ONE CALM JUNE DAY AS HE SLOWLY PACED THE PIAZZA AFTER
BREAKFAST HIS DREAMY GLANCE WAS ARRESTED BY A LITTLE VESSEL
EVIDENTLY NEARING THE SHORE
HE CALLED FOR HIS SPYGLASS AND SURVEYING
THE CRAFT SAW THAT SHE CAME FROM THE NEIGHBORING ISLAND
SHE GLIDED
SMOOTHLY SLOWLY OVER THE SUMMER SEA
THE WARM MORNING AIR WAS SWEET
WITH PERFUMES AND SILENT WITH HEAT
THE SEA SPARKLED LANGUIDLY AND
THE BRILLIANT BLUE HUNG CLOUDLESSLY OVER
SCORES OF LITTLE ISLAND
VESSELS HAD MY GRANDFATHER SEEN COME OVER THE HORIZON AND CAST ANCHOR
IN THE PORT
HUNDREDS OF SUMMER MORNINGS HAD THE WHITE SAILS FLASHED
AND FADED LIKE VAGUE FACES THROUGH FORGOTTEN DREAMS
BUT THIS TIME HE
LAID DOWN THE SPYGLASS AND LEANED AGAINST A COLUMN OF THE PIAZZA AND
WATCHED THE VESSEL WITH AN INTENTNESS THAT HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN
SHE
CAME NEARER AND NEARER A GRACEFUL SPECTRE IN THE DAZZLING MORNING
'DECIDEDLY I MUST STEP DOWN AND SEE ABOUT THAT VESSEL SAID MY
GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM
HE GATHERED HIS AMPLE DRESSING GOWN ABOUT HIM AND STEPPED FROM THE
PIAZZA WITH NO OTHER PROTECTION FROM THE SUN THAN THE LITTLE SMOKING
CAP UPON HIS HEAD
HIS FACE WORE A CALM BEAMING SMILE AS IF HE
APPROVED OF ALL THE WORLD
HE WAS NOT AN OLD MAN BUT THERE WAS ALMOST
A PATRIARCHAL PATHOS IN HIS EXPRESSION AS HE SAUNTERED ALONG IN THE
SUNSHINE TOWARDS THE SHORE
A GROUP OF IDLE GAZERS WAS COLLECTED TO
WATCH THE ARRIVAL
THE LITTLE VESSEL FURLED HER SAILS AND DRIFTED
SLOWLY LANDWARD AND AS SHE WAS OF VERY LIGHT DRAFT SHE CAME CLOSE TO
THE SHELVING SHORE
A LONG PLANK WAS PUT OUT FROM HER SIDE AND THE
DEBARKATION COMMENCED
MY GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM STOOD LOOKING ON TO
SEE THE PASSENGERS DESCEND
THERE WERE BUT A FEW OF THEM AND MOSTLY
TRADERS FROM THE NEIGHBORING ISLAND
BUT SUDDENLY THE FACE OF A YOUNG
GIRL APPEARED OVER THE SIDE OF THE VESSEL AND SHE STEPPED UPON THE
PLANK TO DESCEND
MY GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM INSTANTLY ADVANCED AND
MOVING BRISKLY REACHED THE TOP OF THE PLANK AT THE SAME MOMENT AND
WITH THE OLD TASSEL OF HIS CAP FLASHING IN THE SUN AND ONE HAND IN
THE POCKET OF HIS DRESSING GOWN WITH THE OTHER HE HANDED THE YOUNG
LADY CAREFULLY DOWN THE PLANK
THAT YOUNG LADY WAS AFTERWARDS MY
GRANDMOTHER TITBOTTOM
AND SO OVER THE GLEAMING SEA WHICH HE HAD WATCHED SO LONG AND WHICH
SEEMED THUS TO REWARD HIS PATIENT GAZE CAME HIS BRIDE THAT SUNNY
MORNING
'OF COURSE WE ARE HAPPY HE USED TO SAY 'FOR YOU ARE THE GIFT OF
THE SUN I HAVE LOVED SO LONG AND SO WELL AND MY GRANDFATHER
TITBOTTOM WOULD LAY HIS HAND SO TENDERLY UPON THE GOLDEN HAIR OF HIS
YOUNG BRIDE THAT YOU COULD FANCY HIM A DEVOUT PARSEE CARESSING
SUNBEAMS
THERE WERE ENDLESS FESTIVITIES UPON OCCASION OF THE MARRIAGE AND MY
GRANDFATHER DID NOT GO TO ONE OF THEM IN HIS DRESSING GOWN
THE GENTLE
SWEETNESS OF HIS WIFE MELTED EVERY HEART INTO LOVE AND SYMPATHY
HE
WAS MUCH OLDER THAN SHE WITHOUT DOUBT
BUT AGE AS HE USED TO SAY
WITH A SMILE OF IMMORTAL YOUTH IS A MATTER OF FEELING NOT OF YEARS
AND IF SOMETIMES AS SHE SAT BY HIS SIDE UPON THE PIAZZA HER FANCY
LOOKED THROUGH HER EYES UPON THAT SUMMER SEA AND SAW A YOUNGER LOVER
PERHAPS SOME ONE OF THOSE GRACEFUL AND GLOWING HEROES WHO OCCUPY THE
FOREGROUND OF ALL YOUNG MAIDENS' VISIONS BY THE SEA YET SHE COULD NOT
FIND ONE MORE GENEROUS AND GRACIOUS NOR FANCY ONE MORE WORTHY AND
LOVING THAN MY GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM
AND IF IN THE MOONLIT MIDNIGHT
WHILE HE LAY CALMLY SLEEPING SHE LEANED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SANK
INTO VAGUE REVERIES OF SWEET POSSIBILITY AND WATCHED THE GLEAMING
PATH OF THE MOONLIGHT UPON THE WATER UNTIL THE DAWN GLIDED OVER
IT IT WAS ONLY THAT MOOD OF NAMELESS REGRET AND LONGING WHICH
UNDERLIES ALL HUMAN HAPPINESS OR IT WAS THE VISION OF THAT LIFE OF
SOCIETY WHICH SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT OF WHICH SHE HAD OFTEN READ
AND WHICH LOOKED VERY FAIR AND ALLURING ACROSS THE SEA TO A GIRLISH
IMAGINATION WHICH KNEW THAT IT SHOULD NEVER KNOW THAT REALITY
THESE WEST INDIAN YEARS WERE THE GREAT DAYS OF THE FAMILY SAID
TITBOTTOM WITH AN AIR OF MAJESTIC AND REGAL REGRET PAUSING AND
MUSING IN OUR LITTLE PARLOR LIKE A LATE STUART IN EXILE REMEMBERING
ENGLAND
PRUE RAISED HER EYES FROM HER WORK AND LOOKED AT HIM WITH A
SUBDUED ADMIRATION FOR I HAVE OBSERVED THAT LIKE THE REST OF HER
SEX SHE HAS A SINGULAR SYMPATHY WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE OF A REDUCED
FAMILY
PERHAPS IT IS THEIR FINER PERCEPTION WHICH LEADS THESE
TENDER HEARTED WOMEN TO RECOGNIZE THE DIVINE RIGHT OF SOCIAL
SUPERIORITY SO MUCH MORE READILY THAN WE AND YET MUCH AS TITBOTTOM
WAS ENHANCED IN MY WIFE'S ADMIRATION BY THE DISCOVERY THAT HIS DUSKY
SADNESS OF NATURE AND EXPRESSION WAS AS IT WERE THE EXPIRING GLEAM
AND LATE TWILIGHT OF ANCESTRAL SPLENDORS I DOUBT IF MR
BOURNE WOULD
HAVE PREFERRED HIM FOR BOOKKEEPER A MOMENT SOONER UPON THAT ACCOUNT
IN TRUTH I HAVE OBSERVED DOWN TOWN THAT THE FACT OF YOUR ANCESTORS
DOING NOTHING IS NOT CONSIDERED GOOD PROOF THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
BUT PRUE AND HER SEX REGARD SENTIMENT MORE THAN ACTION AND I
UNDERSTAND EASILY ENOUGH WHY SHE IS NEVER TIRED OF HEARING ME READ OF
PRINCE CHARLIE
IF TITBOTTOM HAD BEEN ONLY A LITTLE YOUNGER A LITTLE
HANDSOMER A LITTLE MORE GALLANTLY DRESSED IN FACT A LITTLE MORE OF
THE PRINCE CHARLIE I AM SURE HER EYES WOULD NOT HAVE FALLEN AGAIN
UPON HER WORK SO TRANQUILLY AS HE RESUMED HIS STORY
I CAN REMEMBER MY GRANDFATHER TITBOTTOM ALTHOUGH I WAS A VERY YOUNG
CHILD AND HE WAS A VERY OLD MAN
MY YOUNG MOTHER AND MY YOUNG
GRANDMOTHER ARE VERY DISTINCT FIGURES IN MY MEMORY MINISTERING TO THE
OLD GENTLEMAN WRAPPED IN HIS DRESSING GOWN AND SEATED UPON THE
PIAZZA
I REMEMBER HIS WHITE HAIR AND HIS CALM SMILE AND HOW NOT
LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE CALLED ME TO HIM AND LAYING HIS HAND UPON MY
HEAD SAID TO ME
MY CHILD THE WORLD IS NOT THIS GREAT SUNNY PIAZZA NOR LIFE THE
FAIRY STORIES WHICH THE WOMEN TELL YOU HERE AS YOU SIT IN THEIR LAPS
I SHALL SOON BE GONE BUT I WANT TO LEAVE WITH YOU SOME MEMENTO OF MY
LOVE FOR YOU AND I KNOW NOTHING MORE VALUABLE THAN THESE SPECTACLES
WHICH YOUR GRANDMOTHER BROUGHT FROM HER NATIVE ISLAND WHEN SHE
ARRIVED HERE ONE FINE SUMMER MORNING LONG AGO
I CANNOT QUITE TELL
WHETHER WHEN YOU GROW OLDER YOU WILL REGARD IT AS A GIFT OF THE
GREATEST VALUE OR AS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD BEEN HAPPIER NEVER TO HAVE
POSSESSED
'BUT GRANDPAPA I AM NOT SHORT SIGHTED
'MY SON ARE YOU NOT HUMAN SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND HOW SHALL I
EVER FORGET THE THOUGHTFUL SADNESS WITH WHICH AT THE SAME TIME HE
HANDED ME THE SPECTACLES
INSTINCTIVELY I PUT THEM ON AND LOOKED AT MY GRANDFATHER
BUT I SAW
NO GRANDFATHER NO PIAZZA NO FLOWERED DRESSING GOWN I SAW ONLY A
LUXURIANT PALM TREE WAVING BROADLY OVER A TRANQUIL LANDSCAPE
PLEASANT HOMES CLUSTERED AROUND IT
GARDENS TEEMING WITH FRUIT AND
FLOWERS FLOCKS QUIETLY FEEDING BIRDS WHEELING AND CHIRPING
I HEARD
CHILDREN'S VOICES AND THE LOW LULLABY OF HAPPY MOTHERS
THE SOUND OF
CHEERFUL SINGING CAME WAFTED FROM DISTANT FIELDS UPON THE LIGHT
BREEZE
GOLDEN HARVESTS GLISTENED OUT OF SIGHT AND I CAUGHT THEIR
RUSTLING WHISPER OF PROSPERITY
A WARM MELLOW ATMOSPHERE BATHED THE
WHOLE
I HAVE SEEN COPIES OF THE LANDSCAPES OF THE ITALIAN PAINTER
CLAUDE WHICH SEEMED TO ME FAINT REMINISCENCES OF THAT CALM AND HAPPY
VISION
BUT ALL THIS PEACE AND PROSPERITY SEEMED TO FLOW FROM THE
SPREADING PALM AS FROM A FOUNTAIN
I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG I LOOKED BUT I HAD APPARENTLY NO POWER AS
I HAD NO WILL TO REMOVE THE SPECTACLES
WHAT A WONDERFUL ISLAND MUST
NEVIS BE THOUGHT I IF PEOPLE CARRY SUCH PICTURES IN THEIR POCKETS
ONLY BY BUYING A PAIR OF SPECTACLES WHAT WONDER THAT MY DEAR
GRANDMOTHER TITBOTTOM HAS LIVED SUCH A PLACID LIFE AND HAS BLESSED US
ALL WITH HER SUNNY TEMPER WHEN SHE HAS LIVED SURROUNDED BY SUCH
IMAGES OF PEACE
MY GRANDFATHER DIED
BUT STILL IN THE WARM MORNING SUNSHINE UPON THE
PIAZZA I FELT HIS PLACID PRESENCE AND AS I CRAWLED INTO HIS GREAT
CHAIR AND DRIFTED ON IN REVERIE THROUGH THE STILL TROPICAL DAY IT
WAS AS IF HIS SOFT DREAMY EYE HAD PASSED INTO MY SOUL
MY GRANDMOTHER
CHERISHED HIS MEMORY WITH TENDER REGRET
A VIOLENT PASSION OF GRIEF
FOR HIS LOSS WAS NO MORE POSSIBLE THAN FOR THE PENSIVE DECAY OF THE
YEAR
WE HAVE NO PORTRAIT OF HIM BUT I SEE ALWAYS WHEN I REMEMBER
HIM THAT PEACEFUL AND LUXURIANT PALM
AND I THINK THAT TO HAVE KNOWN
ONE GOOD OLD MAN ONE MAN WHO THROUGH THE CHANCES AND RUBS OF A LONG
LIFE HAS CARRIED HIS HEART IN HIS HAND LIKE A PALM BRANCH WAVING
ALL DISCORDS INTO PEACE HELPS OUR FAITH IN GOD IN OURSELVES AND IN
EACH OTHER MORE THAN MANY SERMONS
I HARDLY KNOW WHETHER TO BE
GRATEFUL TO MY GRANDFATHER FOR THE SPECTACLES AND YET WHEN I REMEMBER
THAT IT IS TO THEM I OWE THE PLEASANT IMAGE OF HIM WHICH I CHERISH I
SEEM TO MYSELF SADLY UNGRATEFUL
MADAM SAID TITBOTTOM TO PRUE SOLEMNLY MY MEMORY IS A LONG AND
GLOOMY GALLERY AND ONLY REMOTELY AT ITS FURTHER END DO I SEE THE
GLIMMER OF SOFT SUNSHINE AND ONLY THERE ARE THE PLEASANT PICTURES
HUNG
THEY SEEM TO ME VERY HAPPY ALONG WHOSE GALLERY THE SUNLIGHT
STREAMS TO THEIR VERY FEET STRIKING ALL THE PICTURED WALLS INTO
UNFADING SPLENDOR
PRUE HAD LAID HER WORK IN HER LAP AND AS TITBOTTOM PAUSED A MOMENT
AND I TURNED TOWARDS HER I FOUND HER MILD EYES FASTENED UPON MY FACE
AND GLISTENING WITH HAPPY TEARS
MISFORTUNES OF MANY KINDS CAME HEAVILY UPON THE FAMILY AFTER THE HEAD
WAS GONE
THE GREAT HOUSE WAS RELINQUISHED
MY PARENTS WERE BOTH DEAD
AND MY GRANDMOTHER HAD ENTIRE CHARGE OF ME
BUT FROM THE MOMENT THAT I
RECEIVED THE GIFT OF THE SPECTACLES I COULD NOT RESIST THEIR
FASCINATION AND I WITHDREW INTO MYSELF AND BECAME A SOLITARY BOY
THERE WERE NOT MANY COMPANIONS FOR ME OF MY OWN AGE AND THEY
GRADUALLY LEFT ME OR AT LEAST HAD NOT A HEARTY SYMPATHY WITH ME
FOR IF THEY TEASED ME I PULLED OUT MY SPECTACLES AND SURVEYED THEM SO
SERIOUSLY THAT THEY ACQUIRED A KIND OF AWE OF ME AND EVIDENTLY
REGARDED MY GRANDFATHER'S GIFT AS A CONCEALED MAGICAL WEAPON WHICH
MIGHT BE DANGEROUSLY DRAWN UPON THEM AT ANY MOMENT
WHENEVER IN OUR
GAMES THERE WERE QUARRELS AND HIGH WORDS AND I BEGAN TO FEEL ABOUT
MY DRESS AND TO WEAR A GRAVE LOOK THEY ALL TOOK THE ALARM AND
SHOUTED 'LOOK OUT FOR TITBOTTOM'S SPECTACLES AND SCATTERED LIKE A
FLOCK OF SCARED SHEEP
NOR COULD I WONDER AT IT
FOR AT FIRST BEFORE THEY TOOK THE ALARM
I SAW STRANGE SIGHTS WHEN I LOOKED AT THEM THROUGH THE GLASSES
IF TWO
WERE QUARRELLING ABOUT A MARBLE OR A BALL I HAD ONLY TO GO BEHIND A
TREE WHERE I WAS CONCEALED AND LOOK AT THEM LEISURELY
THEN THE SCENE
CHANGED AND NO LONGER A GREEN MEADOW WITH BOYS PLAYING BUT A SPOT
WHICH I DID NOT RECOGNIZE AND FORMS THAT MADE ME SHUDDER OR SMILE
IT
WAS NOT A BIG BOY BULLYING A LITTLE ONE BUT A YOUNG WOLF WITH
GLISTENING TEETH AND A LAMB COWERING BEFORE HIM OR IT WAS A DOG
FAITHFUL AND FAMISHING OR A STAR GOING SLOWLY INTO ECLIPSE OR A
RAINBOW FADING OR A FLOWER BLOOMING OR A SUN RISING OR A WANING
MOON
THE REVELATIONS OF THE SPECTACLES DETERMINED MY FEELING FOR THE
BOYS AND FOR ALL WHOM I SAW THROUGH THEM
NO SHYNESS NOR
AWKWARDNESS NOR SILENCE COULD SEPARATE ME FROM THOSE WHO LOOKED
LOVELY AS LILIES TO MY ILLUMINATED EYES
IF I FELT MYSELF WARMLY DRAWN
TO ANY ONE I STRUGGLED WITH THE FIERCE DESIRE OF SEEING HIM THROUGH
THE SPECTACLES
I LONGED TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF IGNORANT FEELING TO
LOVE WITHOUT KNOWING TO FLOAT LIKE A LEAF UPON THE EDDIES OF LIFE
DRIFTED NOW TO A SUNNY POINT NOW TO A SOLEMN SHADE NOW OVER
GLITTERING RIPPLES NOW OVER GLEAMING CALMS AND NOT TO DETERMINED
PORTS A TRIM VESSEL WITH AN INEXORABLE RUDDER
BUT SOMETIMES MASTERED AFTER LONG STRUGGLES I SEIZED MY SPECTACLES
AND SAUNTERED INTO THE LITTLE TOWN
PUTTING THEM TO MY EYES I PEERED
INTO THE HOUSES AND AT THE PEOPLE WHO PASSED ME
HERE SAT A FAMILY AT
BREAKFAST AND I STOOD AT THE WINDOW LOOKING IN
O MOTLEY MEAL
FANTASTIC VISION THE GOOD MOTHER SAW HER LORD SITTING OPPOSITE A
GRAVE RESPECTABLE BEING EATING MUFFINS
BUT I SAW ONLY A BANK BILL
MORE OR LESS CRUMPLED AND TATTERED MARKED WITH A LARGER OR LESSER
FIGURE
IF A SHARP WIND BLEW SUDDENLY I SAW IT TREMBLE AND FLUTTER
IT WAS THIN FLAT IMPALPABLE
I REMOVED MY GLASSES AND LOOKED WITH
MY EYES AT THE WIFE
I COULD HAVE SMILED TO SEE THE HUMID TENDERNESS
WITH WHICH SHE REGARDED HER STRANGE VIS VIS
IS LIFE ONLY A GAME
OF BLIND MAN'S BUFF OF DROLL CROSS PURPOSES
OR I PUT THEM ON AGAIN AND LOOKED AT THE WIFE
HOW MANY STOUT TREES
I SAW HOW MANY TENDER FLOWERS HOW MANY PLACID POOLS YES AND HOW
MANY LITTLE STREAMS WINDING OUT OF SIGHT SHRINKING BEFORE THE LARGE
HARD ROUND EYES OPPOSITE AND SLIPPING OFF INTO SOLITUDE AND SHADE
WITH A LOW INNER SONG FOR THEIR OWN SOLACE
AND IN MANY HOUSES I
THOUGHT TO SEE ANGELS NYMPHS OR AT LEAST WOMEN AND COULD ONLY FIND
BROOMSTICKS MOPS OR KETTLES HURRYING ABOUT RATTLING TINKLING IN
A STATE OF SHRILL ACTIVITY
I MADE CALLS UPON ELEGANT LADIES AND
AFTER I HAD ENJOYED THE GLOSS OF SILK AND THE DELICACY OF LACE AND
THE FLASH OF JEWELS I SLIPPED ON MY SPECTACLES AND SAW A PEACOCK'S
FEATHER FLOUNCED AND FURBELOWED AND FLUTTERING OR AN IRON ROD THIN
SHARP AND HARD NOR COULD I POSSIBLY MISTAKE THE MOVEMENT OF THE
DRAPERY FOR ANY FLEXIBILITY OF THE THING DRAPED OR MYSTERIOUSLY
CHILLED I SAW A STATUE OF PERFECT FORM OR FLOWING MOVEMENT IT MIGHT
BE ALABASTER OR BRONZE OR MARBLE BUT SADLY OFTEN IT WAS ICE AND I
KNEW THAT AFTER IT HAD SHONE A LITTLE AND FROZEN A FEW EYES WITH ITS
DESPAIRING PERFECTION IT COULD NOT BE PUT AWAY IN THE NICHES OF
PALACES FOR ORNAMENT AND PROUD FAMILY TRADITION LIKE THE ALABASTER
OR BRONZE OR MARBLE STATUES BUT WOULD MELT AND SHRINK AND FALL
COLDLY AWAY IN COLORLESS AND USELESS WATER BE ABSORBED IN THE EARTH
AND UTTERLY FORGOTTEN
BUT THE TRUE SADNESS WAS RATHER IN SEEING THOSE WHO NOT HAVING THE
SPECTACLES THOUGHT THAT THE IRON ROD WAS FLEXIBLE AND THE ICE STATUE
WARM
I SAW MANY A GALLANT HEART WHICH SEEMED TO ME BRAVE AND LOYAL
AS THE CRUSADERS SENT BY GENUINE AND NOBLE FAITH TO SYRIA AND THE
SEPULCHRE PURSUING THROUGH DAYS AND NIGHTS AND A LONG LIFE OF
DEVOTION THE HOPE OF LIGHTING AT LEAST A SMILE IN THE COLD EYES IF
NOT A FIRE IN THE ICY HEART
I WATCHED THE EARNEST ENTHUSIASTIC
SACRIFICE
I SAW THE PURE RESOLVE THE GENEROUS FAITH THE FINE SCORN
OF DOUBT THE IMPATIENCE OF SUSPICION
I WATCHED THE GRACE THE ARDOR
THE GLORY OF DEVOTION
THROUGH THOSE STRANGE SPECTACLES HOW OFTEN I
SAW THE NOBLEST HEART RENOUNCING ALL OTHER HOPE ALL OTHER AMBITION
ALL OTHER LIFE THAN THE POSSIBLE LOVE OF SOME ONE OF THOSE STATUES
AH ME IT WAS TERRIBLE BUT THEY HAD NOT THE LOVE TO GIVE
THE PARIAN
FACE WAS SO POLISHED AND SMOOTH BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SORROW UPON THE
HEART AND DREARILY OFTEN NO HEART TO BE TOUCHED
I COULD NOT
WONDER THAT THE NOBLE HEART OF DEVOTION WAS BROKEN FOR IT HAD DASHED
ITSELF AGAINST A STONE
I WEPT UNTIL MY SPECTACLES WERE DIMMED FOR
THAT HOPELESS SORROW BUT THERE WAS A PANG BEYOND TEARS FOR THOSE ICY
STATUES
STILL A BOY I WAS THUS TOO MUCH A MAN IN KNOWLEDGE I DID NOT
COMPREHEND THE SIGHTS I WAS COMPELLED TO SEE
I USED TO TEAR MY
GLASSES AWAY FROM MY EYES AND FRIGHTENED AT MYSELF RUN TO ESCAPE MY
OWN CONSCIOUSNESS
REACHING THE SMALL HOUSE WHERE WE THEN LIVED I
PLUNGED INTO MY GRANDMOTHER'S ROOM AND THROWING MYSELF UPON THE
FLOOR BURIED MY FACE IN HER LAP AND SOBBED MYSELF TO SLEEP WITH
PREMATURE GRIEF
BUT WHEN I AWAKENED AND FELT HER COOL HAND UPON MY
HOT FOREHEAD AND HEARD THE LOW SWEET SONG OR THE GENTLE STORY OR
THE TENDERLY TOLD PARABLE FROM THE BIBLE WITH WHICH SHE TRIED TO
SOOTHE ME I COULD NOT RESIST THE MYSTIC FASCINATION THAT LURED ME AS
I LAY IN HER LAP TO STEAL A GLANCE AT HER THROUGH THE SPECTACLES
PICTURES OF THE MADONNA HAVE NOT HER RARE AND PENSIVE BEAUTY
UPON
THE TRANQUIL LITTLE ISLANDS HER LIFE HAD BEEN EVENTLESS AND ALL THE
FINE POSSIBILITIES OF HER NATURE WERE LIKE FLOWERS THAT NEVER BLOOMED
PLACID WERE ALL HER YEARS YET I HAVE READ OF NO HEROINE OF NO WOMAN
GREAT IN SUDDEN CRISES THAT IT DID NOT SEEM TO ME SHE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN
THE WIFE AND WIDOW OF A MAN WHO LOVED HIS OWN HOME BETTER THAN
THE HOMES OF OTHERS I HAVE YET HEARD OF NO QUEEN NO BELLE NO
IMPERIAL BEAUTY WHOM IN GRACE AND BRILLIANCY AND PERSUASIVE
COURTESY SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE SURPASSED
MADAM SAID TITBOTTOM TO MY WIFE WHOSE HEART HUNG UPON HIS STORY
YOUR HUSBAND'S YOUNG FRIEND AURELIA WEARS SOMETIMES A CAMELIA IN
HER HAIR AND NO DIAMOND IN THE BALL ROOM SEEMS SO COSTLY AS THAT
PERFECT FLOWER WHICH WOMEN ENVY AND FOR WHOSE LEAST AND WITHERED
PETAL MEN SIGH YET IN THE TROPICAL SOLITUDES OF BRAZIL HOW MANY A
CAMELIA BUD DROPS FROM A BUSH THAT NO EYE HAS EVER SEEN WHICH HAD IT
FLOWERED AND BEEN NOTICED WOULD HAVE GILDED ALL HEARTS WITH ITS
MEMORY
WHEN I STOLE THESE FURTIVE GLANCES AT MY GRANDMOTHER HALF FEARING
THAT THEY WERE WRONG I SAW ONLY A CALM LAKE WHOSE SHORES WERE LOW
AND OVER WHICH THE SKY HUNG UNBROKEN SO THAT THE LEAST STAR WAS
CLEARLY REFLECTED
IT HAD AN ATMOSPHERE OF SOLEMN TWILIGHT
TRANQUILLITY AND SO COMPLETELY DID ITS UNRUFFLED SURFACE BLEND WITH
THE CLOUDLESS STAR STUDDED SKY THAT WHEN I LOOKED THROUGH MY
SPECTACLES AT MY GRANDMOTHER THE VISION SEEMED TO ME ALL HEAVEN AND
STARS
YET AS I GAZED AND GAZED I FELT WHAT STATELY CITIES MIGHT
WELL HAVE BEEN BUILT UPON THOSE SHORES AND HAVE FLASHED PROSPERITY
OVER THE CALM LIKE CORUSCATIONS OF PEARLS
I DREAMED OF GORGEOUS FLEETS SILKEN SAILED AND BLOWN BY PERFUMED
WINDS DRIFTING OVER THOSE DEPTHLESS WATERS AND THROUGH THOSE SPACIOUS
SKIES
I GAZED UPON THE TWILIGHT THE INSCRUTABLE SILENCE LIKE A
GOD FEARING DISCOVERER UPON A NEW AND VAST AND DIM SEA BURSTING
UPON HIM THROUGH FOREST GLOOMS AND IN THE FERVOR OF WHOSE IMPASSIONED
GAZE A MILLENNIAL AND POETIC WORLD ARISES AND MAN NEED NO LONGER DIE
TO BE HAPPY
MY COMPANIONS NATURALLY DESERTED ME FOR I HAD GROWN WEARILY GRAVE
AND ABSTRACTED AND UNABLE TO RESIST THE ALLUREMENT OF MY SPECTACLES
I WAS CONSTANTLY LOST IN A WORLD OF WHICH THOSE COMPANIONS WERE PART
YET OF WHICH THEY KNEW NOTHING
I GREW COLD AND HARD ALMOST MOROSE
PEOPLE SEEMED TO ME BLIND AND UNREASONABLE
THEY DID THE WRONG THING
THEY CALLED GREEN YELLOW AND BLACK WHITE
YOUNG MEN SAID OF A GIRL
'WHAT A LOVELY SIMPLE CREATURE I LOOKED AND THERE WAS ONLY A
GLISTENING WISP OF STRAW DRY AND HOLLOW
OR THEY SAID 'WHAT A COLD
PROUD BEAUTY I LOOKED AND LO A MADONNA WHOSE HEART HELD THE
WORLD
OR THEY SAID 'WHAT A WILD GIDDY GIRL AND I SAW A GLANCING
DANCING MOUNTAIN STREAM PURE AS THE VIRGIN SNOWS WHENCE IT FLOWED
SINGING THROUGH SUN AND SHADE OVER PEARLS AND GOLD DUST SLIPPING
ALONG UNSTAINED BY WEED OR RAIN OR HEAVY FOOT OF CATTLE TOUCHING
THE FLOWERS WITH A DEWY KISS A BEAM OF GRACE A HAPPY SONG A LINE
OF LIGHT IN THE DIM AND TROUBLED LANDSCAPE
MY GRANDMOTHER SENT ME TO SCHOOL BUT I LOOKED AT THE MASTER AND SAW
THAT HE WAS A SMOOTH ROUND FERULE OR AN IMPROPER NOUN OR A VULGAR
FRACTION AND REFUSED TO OBEY HIM
OR HE WAS A PIECE OF STRING A RAG
A WILLOW WAND AND I HAD A CONTEMPTUOUS PITY
BUT ONE WAS A WELL OF
COOL DEEP WATER AND LOOKING SUDDENLY IN ONE DAY I SAW THE STARS
HE GAVE ME ALL MY SCHOOLING
WITH HIM I USED TO WALK BY THE SEA AND
AS WE STROLLED AND THE WAVES PLUNGED IN LONG LEGIONS BEFORE US I
LOOKED AT HIM THROUGH THE SPECTACLES AND AS HIS EYE DILATED WITH THE
BOUNDLESS VIEW AND HIS CHEST HEAVED WITH AN IMPOSSIBLE DESIRE I SAW
XERXES AND HIS ARMY TOSSING AND GLITTERING RANK UPON RANK MULTITUDE
UPON MULTITUDE OUT OF SIGHT BUT EVER REGULARLY ADVANCING AND WITH
THE CONFUSED ROAR OF CEASELESS MUSIC PROSTRATING THEMSELVES IN ABJECT
HOMAGE
OR AS WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND HAIR STREAMING ON THE WIND
HE CHANTED FULL LINES OF THE RESOUNDING ILIAD I SAW HOMER PACING THE
AEGEAN SANDS IN THE GREEK SUNSETS OF FORGOTTEN TIMES
MY GRANDMOTHER DIED AND I WAS THROWN INTO THE WORLD WITHOUT
RESOURCES AND WITH NO CAPITAL BUT MY SPECTACLES
I TRIED TO FIND
EMPLOYMENT BUT MEN WERE SHY OF ME
THERE WAS A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT I
WAS EITHER A LITTLE CRAZED OR A GOOD DEAL IN LEAGUE WITH THE PRINCE
OF DARKNESS
MY COMPANIONS WHO WOULD PERSIST IN CALLING A PIECE OF
PAINTED MUSLIN A FAIR AND FRAGRANT FLOWER HAD NO DIFFICULTY SUCCESS
WAITED FOR THEM AROUND EVERY CORNER AND ARRIVED IN EVERY SHIP
I
TRIED TO TEACH FOR I LOVED CHILDREN
BUT IF ANYTHING EXCITED MY
SUSPICION AND PUTTING ON MY SPECTACLES I SAW THAT I WAS FONDLING A
SNAKE OR SMELLING AT A BUD WITH A WORM IN IT I SPRANG UP IN HORROR
AND RAN AWAY OR IF IT SEEMED TO ME THROUGH THE GLASSES THAT A CHERUB
SMILED UPON ME OR A ROSE WAS BLOOMING IN MY BUTTONHOLE THEN I FELT
MYSELF IMPERFECT AND IMPURE NOT FIT TO BE LEADING AND TRAINING WHAT
WAS SO ESSENTIALLY SUPERIOR IN QUALITY TO MYSELF AND I KISSED THE
CHILDREN AND LEFT THEM WEEPING AND WONDERING
IN DESPAIR I WENT TO A GREAT MERCHANT ON THE ISLAND AND ASKED HIM TO
EMPLOY ME
'MY YOUNG FRIEND SAID HE 'I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE SOME SINGULAR
SECRET SOME CHARM OR SPELL OR GIFT OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW
WHAT OF WHICH PEOPLE ARE AFRAID
NOW YOU KNOW MY DEAR SAID THE
MERCHANT SWELLING UP AND APPARENTLY PROUDER OF HIS GREAT STOMACH
THAN OF HIS LARGE FORTUNE 'I AM NOT OF THAT KIND
I AM NOT EASILY
FRIGHTENED
YOU MAY SPARE YOURSELF THE PAIN OF TRYING TO IMPOSE UPON
ME
PEOPLE WHO PROPOSE TO COME TO TIME BEFORE I ARRIVE ARE ACCUSTOMED
TO ARISE VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING SAID HE THRUSTING HIS THUMBS IN
THE ARMHOLES OF HIS WAISTCOAT AND SPREADING THE FINGERS LIKE TWO
FANS UPON HIS BOSOM
'I THINK I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR SECRET
YOU HAVE A PAIR OF SPECTACLES I BELIEVE THAT YOU VALUE VERY MUCH
BECAUSE YOUR GRANDMOTHER BROUGHT THEM AS A MARRIAGE PORTION TO YOUR
GRANDFATHER
NOW IF YOU THINK FIT TO SELL ME THOSE SPECTACLES I WILL
PAY YOU THE LARGEST MARKET PRICE FOR GLASSES
WHAT DO YOU SAY
I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF SELLING MY
SPECTACLES
'MY YOUNG FRIEND MEANS TO EAT THEM I SUPPOSE SAID HE WITH A
CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE
I MADE NO REPLY BUT WAS TURNING TO LEAVE THE OFFICE WHEN THE
MERCHANT CALLED AFTER ME
'MY YOUNG FRIEND POOR PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER SUFFER THEMSELVES TO GET
INTO PETS
ANGER IS AN EXPENSIVE LUXURY IN WHICH ONLY MEN OF A
CERTAIN INCOME CAN INDULGE
A PAIR OF SPECTACLES AND A HOT TEMPER ARE
NOT THE MOST PROMISING CAPITAL FOR SUCCESS IN LIFE MASTER TITBOTTOM
I SAID NOTHING BUT PUT MY HAND UPON THE DOOR TO GO OUT WHEN THE
MERCHANT SAID MORE RESPECTFULLY
'WELL YOU FOOLISH BOY IF YOU WILL NOT SELL YOUR SPECTACLES PERHAPS
YOU WILL AGREE TO SELL THE USE OF THEM TO ME
THAT IS YOU SHALL ONLY
PUT THEM ON WHEN I DIRECT YOU AND FOR MY PURPOSES
HALLO YOU LITTLE
FOOL CRIED HE IMPATIENTLY AS HE SAW THAT I INTENDED TO MAKE NO
REPLY
BUT I HAD PULLED OUT MY SPECTACLES AND PUT THEM ON FOR MY OWN
PURPOSE AND AGAINST HIS DIRECTION AND DESIRE
I LOOKED AT HIM AND
SAW A HUGE BALD HEADED WILD BOAR WITH GROSS CHOPS AND A LEERING
EYE ONLY THE MORE RIDICULOUS FOR THE HIGH ARCHED GOLD BOWED
SPECTACLES THAT STRADDLED HIS NOSE
ONE OF HIS FORE HOOFS WAS THRUST
INTO THE SAFE WHERE HIS BILLS PAYABLE WERE HIVED AND THE OTHER INTO
HIS POCKET AMONG THE LOOSE CHANGE AND BILLS THERE
HIS EARS WERE
PRICKED FORWARD WITH A BRISK SENSITIVE SMARTNESS
IN A WORLD WHERE
PRIZE PORK WAS THE BEST EXCELLENCE HE WOULD HAVE CARRIED OFF ALL THE
PREMIUMS
I STEPPED INTO THE NEXT OFFICE IN THE STREET AND A MILD FACED
GENIAL MAN ALSO A LARGE AND OPULENT MERCHANT ASKED ME MY BUSINESS IN
SUCH A TONE THAT I INSTANTLY LOOKED THROUGH MY SPECTACLES AND SAW A
LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY
THERE I PITCHED MY TENT AND STAYED
TILL THE GOOD MAN DIED AND HIS BUSINESS WAS DISCONTINUED
BUT WHILE THERE SAID TITBOTTOM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED AWAY INTO A
SIGH I FIRST SAW PRECIOSA
SPITE OF THE SPECTACLES I SAW PRECIOSA
FOR DAYS FOR WEEKS FOR MONTHS I DID NOT TAKE MY SPECTACLES WITH ME
I RAN AWAY FROM THEM I THREW THEM UP ON HIGH SHELVES I TRIED TO MAKE
UP MY MIND TO THROW THEM INTO THE SEA OR DOWN THE WELL
I COULD NOT
I WOULD NOT I DARED NOT LOOK AT PRECIOSA THROUGH THE SPECTACLES
IT
WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME DELIBERATELY TO DESTROY THEM BUT I AWOKE IN
THE NIGHT AND COULD ALMOST HAVE CURSED MY DEAR OLD GRANDFATHER FOR
HIS GIFT
I ESCAPED FROM THE OFFICE AND SAT FOR WHOLE DAYS WITH
PRECIOSA
I TOLD HER THE STRANGE THINGS I HAD SEEN WITH MY MYSTIC
GLASSES
THE HOURS WERE NOT ENOUGH FOR THE WILD ROMANCES WHICH I RAVED
IN HER EAR
SHE LISTENED ASTONISHED AND APPALLED
HER BLUE EYES
TURNED UPON ME WITH A SWEET DEPRECATION
SHE CLUNG TO ME AND THEN
WITHDREW AND FLED FEARFULLY FROM THE ROOM
BUT SHE COULD NOT STAY
AWAY
SHE COULD NOT RESIST MY VOICE IN WHOSE TONES BURNED ALL THE
LOVE THAT FILLED MY HEART AND BRAIN
THE VERY EFFORT TO RESIST THE
DESIRE OF SEEING HER AS I SAW EVERYBODY ELSE GAVE A FRENZY AND AN
UNNATURAL TENSION TO MY FEELING AND MY MANNER
I SAT BY HER SIDE
LOOKING INTO HER EYES SMOOTHING HER HAIR FOLDING HER TO MY HEART
WHICH WAS SUNKEN AND DEEP WHY NOT FOREVER IN THAT DREAM OF PEACE
I
RAN FROM HER PRESENCE AND SHOUTED AND LEAPED WITH JOY AND SAT THE
WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH THRILLED INTO HAPPINESS BY THE THOUGHT OF HER
LOVE AND LOVELINESS LIKE A WIND HARP TIGHTLY STRUNG AND ANSWERING
THE AIRIEST SIGH OF THE BREEZE WITH MUSIC
THEN CAME CALMER DAYS THE
CONVICTION OF DEEP LOVE SETTLED UPON OUR LIVES AS AFTER THE HURRYING
HEAVING DAYS OF SPRING COMES THE BLAND AND BENIGNANT SUMMER
'IT IS NO DREAM THEN AFTER ALL AND WE ARE HAPPY I SAID TO HER
ONE DAY AND THERE CAME NO ANSWER FOR HAPPINESS IS SPEECHLESS
WE ARE HAPPY THEN I SAID TO MYSELF THERE IS NO EXCITEMENT NOW
HOW GLAD I AM THAT I CAN NOW LOOK AT HER THROUGH MY SPECTACLES
I FEARED LEST SOME INSTINCT SHOULD WARN ME TO BEWARE
I ESCAPED FROM HER ARMS AND RAN HOME AND SEIZED THE GLASSES AND
BOUNDED BACK AGAIN TO PRECIOSA
AS I ENTERED THE ROOM I WAS HEATED MY
HEAD WAS SWIMMING WITH CONFUSED APPREHENSION MY EYES MUST HAVE
GLARED
PRECIOSA WAS FRIGHTENED AND RISING FROM HER SEAT STOOD WITH
AN INQUIRING GLANCE OF SURPRISE IN HER EYES
BUT I WAS BENT WITH
FRENZY UPON MY PURPOSE
I WAS MERELY AWARE THAT SHE WAS IN THE ROOM
I
SAW NOTHING ELSE
I HEARD NOTHING
I CARED FOR NOTHING BUT TO SEE HER
THROUGH THAT MAGIC GLASS AND FEEL AT ONCE ALL THE FULNESS OF
BLISSFUL PERFECTION WHICH THAT WOULD REVEAL
PRECIOSA STOOD BEFORE THE
MIRROR BUT ALARMED AT MY WILD AND EAGER MOVEMENTS UNABLE TO
DISTINGUISH WHAT I HAD IN MY HANDS AND SEEING ME RAISE THEM SUDDENLY
TO MY FACE SHE SHRIEKED WITH TERROR AND FELL FAINTING UPON THE
FLOOR AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT I PLACED THE GLASSES BEFORE MY EYES
AND BEHELD MYSELF REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR BEFORE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN
STANDING
DEAR MADAM CRIED TITBOTTOM TO MY WIFE SPRINGING UP AND FALLING
BACK AGAIN IN HIS CHAIR PALE AND TREMBLING WHILE PRUE RAN TO HIM AND
TOOK HIS HAND AND I POURED OUT A GLASS OF WATER I SAW MYSELF
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR MANY MINUTES
PRUE LAID HER HAND GENTLY UPON THE
HEAD OF OUR GUEST WHOSE EYES WERE CLOSED AND WHO BREATHED SOFTLY
LIKE AN INFANT IN SLEEPING
PERHAPS IN ALL THE LONG YEARS OF ANGUISH
SINCE THAT HOUR NO TENDER HAND HAD TOUCHED HIS BROW NOR WIPED AWAY
THE DAMPS OF A BITTER SORROW
PERHAPS THE TENDER MATERNAL FINGERS OF
MY WIFE SOOTHED HIS WEARY HEAD WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE FELT THE
HAND OF HIS MOTHER PLAYING WITH THE LONG HAIR OF HER BOY IN THE SOFT
WEST INDIAN MORNING
PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY THE NATURAL RELIEF OF
EXPRESSING A PENT UP SORROW
WHEN HE SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS WITH THE OLD
SUBDUED TONE AND THE AIR OF QUAINT SOLEMNITY
THESE THINGS WERE MATTERS OF LONG LONG AGO AND I CAME TO THIS
COUNTRY SOON AFTER
I BROUGHT WITH ME PREMATURE AGE A PAST OF
MELANCHOLY MEMORIES AND THE MAGIC SPECTACLES
I HAD BECOME THEIR
SLAVE
I HAD NOTHING MORE TO FEAR
HAVING SEEN MYSELF I WAS COMPELLED
TO SEE OTHERS PROPERLY TO UNDERSTAND MY RELATIONS TO THEM
THE LIGHTS
THAT CHEER THE FUTURE OF OTHER MEN HAD GONE OUT FOR ME
MY EYES WERE
THOSE OF AN EXILE TURNED BACKWARDS UPON THE RECEDING SHORE AND NOT
FORWARDS WITH HOPE UPON THE OCEAN
I MINGLED WITH MEN BUT WITH LITTLE
PLEASURE
THERE ARE BUT MANY VARIETIES OF A FEW TYPES
I DID NOT FIND
THOSE I CAME TO CLEARER SIGHTED THAN THOSE I HAD LEFT BEHIND
I HEARD
MEN CALLED SHREWD AND WISE AND REPORT SAID THEY WERE HIGHLY
INTELLIGENT AND SUCCESSFUL
BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT THEM THROUGH MY
GLASSES I FOUND NO HALO OF REAL MANLINESS
MY FINEST SENSE DETECTED
NO AROMA OF PURITY AND PRINCIPLE BUT I SAW ONLY A FUNGUS THAT HAD
FATTENED AND SPREAD IN A NIGHT
THEY ALL WENT TO THE THEATER TO SEE
ACTORS UPON THE STAGE
I WENT TO SEE ACTORS IN THE BOXES SO
CONSUMMATELY CUNNING THAT THE OTHERS DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE ACTING
AND THEY DID NOT SUSPECT IT THEMSELVES
PERHAPS YOU WONDER IT DID NOT MAKE ME MISANTHROPICAL
MY DEAR
FRIENDS DO NOT FORGET THAT I HAD SEEN MYSELF
IT MADE ME
COMPASSIONATE NOT CYNICAL
OF COURSE I COULD NOT VALUE HIGHLY THE
ORDINARY STANDARDS OF SUCCESS AND EXCELLENCE
WHEN I WENT TO CHURCH
AND SAW A THIN BLUE ARTIFICIAL FLOWER OR A GREAT SLEEPY CUSHION
EXPOUNDING THE BEAUTY OF HOLINESS TO PEWS FULL OF EAGLES HALF EAGLES
AND THREEPENCES HOWEVER ADROITLY CONCEALED IN BROADCLOTH AND BOOTS
OR SAW AN ONION IN AN EASTER BONNET WEEPING OVER THE SINS OF MAGDALEN
I DID NOT FEEL AS THEY FELT WHO SAW IN ALL THIS NOT ONLY PROPRIETY
BUT PIETY
OR WHEN AT PUBLIC MEETINGS AN EEL STOOD UP ON END AND
WRIGGLED AND SQUIRMED LITHELY IN EVERY DIRECTION AND DECLARED THAT
FOR HIS PART HE WENT IN FOR RAINBOWS AND HOT WATER HOW COULD I HELP
SEEING THAT HE WAS STILL BLACK AND LOVED A SLIMY POOL
I COULD NOT GROW MISANTHROPICAL WHEN I SAW IN THE EYES OF SO MANY WHO
WERE CALLED OLD THE GUSHING FOUNTAINS OF ETERNAL YOUTH AND THE LIGHT
OF AN IMMORTAL DAWN OR WHEN I SAW THOSE WHO WERE ESTEEMED
UNSUCCESSFUL AND AIMLESS RULING A FAIR REALM OF PEACE AND PLENTY
EITHER IN THEMSELVES OR MORE PERFECTLY IN ANOTHER A REALM AND
PRINCELY POSSESSION FOR WHICH THEY HAD WELL RENOUNCED A HOPELESS
SEARCH AND A BELATED TRIUMPH
I KNEW ONE MAN WHO HAD BEEN FOR YEARS A
BY WORD FOR HAVING SOUGHT THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
BUT I LOOKED AT HIM
THROUGH THE SPECTACLES AND SAW A SATISFACTION IN CONCENTRATED
ENERGIES AND A TENACITY ARISING FROM DEVOTION TO A NOBLE DREAM WHICH
WAS NOT APPARENT IN THE YOUTHS WHO PITIED HIM IN THE AIMLESS
EFFEMINACY OF CLUBS NOR IN THE CLEVER GENTLEMEN WHO CRACKED THEIR
THIN JOKES UPON HIM OVER A GOSSIPING DINNER
AND THERE WAS YOUR NEIGHBOR OVER THE WAY WHO PASSES FOR A WOMAN WHO
HAS FAILED IN HER CAREER BECAUSE SHE IS AN OLD MAID
PEOPLE WAG
SOLEMN HEADS OF PITY AND SAY THAT SHE MADE SO GREAT A MISTAKE IN NOT
MARRYING THE BRILLIANT AND FAMOUS MAN WHO WAS FOR LONG YEARS HER
SUITOR
IT IS CLEAR THAT NO ORANGE FLOWER WILL EVER BLOOM FOR HER
THE
YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE TENDER ROMANCES ABOUT HER AS THEY WATCH HER AND
THINK OF HER SOLITARY HOURS OF BITTER REGRET AND WASTING LONGING
NEVER TO BE SATISFIED
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO TOWN I SHARED THIS
SYMPATHY AND PLEASED MY IMAGINATION WITH FANCYING HER HARD STRUGGLE
WITH THE CONVICTION THAT SHE HAD LOST ALL THAT MADE LIFE BEAUTIFUL
I
SUPPOSED THAT IF I LOOKED AT HER THROUGH MY SPECTACLES I SHOULD SEE
THAT IT WAS ONLY HER RADIANT TEMPER WHICH SO ILLUMINATED HER DRESS
THAT WE DID NOT SEE IT TO BE HEAVY SABLES
BUT WHEN ONE DAY I DID
RAISE MY GLASSES AND GLANCED AT HER I DID NOT SEE THE OLD MAID WHOM
WE ALL PITIED FOR A SECRET SORROW BUT A WOMAN WHOSE NATURE WAS A
TROPIC IN WHICH THE SUN SHONE AND BIRDS SANG AND FLOWERS BLOOMED
FOREVER
THERE WERE NO REGRETS NO DOUBTS AND HALF WISHES BUT A CALM
SWEETNESS A TRANSPARENT PEACE
I SAW HER BLUSH WHEN THAT OLD LOVER
PASSED BY OR PAUSED TO SPEAK TO HER BUT IT WAS ONLY THE SIGN OF
DELICATE FEMININE CONSCIOUSNESS
SHE KNEW HIS LOVE AND HONORED IT
ALTHOUGH SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT NOR RETURN IT
I LOOKED CLOSELY
AT HER AND I SAW THAT ALTHOUGH ALL THE WORLD HAD EXCLAIMED AT HER
INDIFFERENCE TO SUCH HOMAGE AND HAD DECLARED IT WAS ASTONISHING SHE
SHOULD LOSE SO FINE A MATCH SHE WOULD ONLY SAY SIMPLY AND QUIETLY
'IF SHAKESPEARE LOVED ME AND I DID NOT LOVE HIM HOW COULD I MARRY
HIM
COULD I BE MISANTHROPICAL WHEN I SAW SUCH FIDELITY AND DIGNITY AND
SIMPLICITY
YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT I WAS ESPECIALLY CURIOUS TO LOOK AT THAT OLD
LOVER OF HERS THROUGH MY GLASSES
HE WAS NO LONGER YOUNG YOU KNOW
WHEN I CAME AND HIS FAME AND FORTUNE WERE SECURE
CERTAINLY I HAVE
HEARD OF FEW MEN MORE BELOVED AND OF NONE MORE WORTHY TO BE LOVED
HE
HAD THE EASY MANNER OF A MAN OF THE WORLD THE SENSITIVE GRACE OF A
POET AND THE CHARITABLE JUDGMENT OF A WIDE TRAVELLER
HE WAS
ACCOUNTED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND MOST UNSPOILED OF MEN
HANDSOME
BRILLIANT WISE TENDER GRACEFUL ACCOMPLISHED RICH AND FAMOUS I
LOOKED AT HIM WITHOUT THE SPECTACLES IN SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION
AND WONDERED HOW YOUR NEIGHBOR OVER THE WAY HAD BEEN SO ENTIRELY
UNTOUCHED BY HIS HOMAGE
I WATCHED THEIR INTERCOURSE IN SOCIETY I SAW
HER GAY SMILE HER CORDIAL GREETING I MARKED HIS FRANK ADDRESS HIS
LOFTY COURTESY
THEIR MANNER TOLD NO TALES
THE EAGER WORLD WAS
BALKED AND I PULLED OUT MY SPECTACLES
I HAD SEEN HER ALREADY AND NOW I SAW HIM
HE LIVED ONLY IN MEMORY
AND HIS MEMORY WAS A SPACIOUS AND STATELY PALACE
BUT HE DID NOT
OFTENEST FREQUENT THE BANQUETING HALL WHERE WERE ENDLESS HOSPITALITY
AND FEASTING NOR DID HE LOITER MUCH IN RECEPTION ROOMS WHERE A
THRONG OF NEW VISITORS WAS FOREVER SWARMING NOR DID HE FEED HIS
VANITY BY HAUNTING THE APARTMENT IN WHICH WERE STORED THE TROPHIES OF
HIS VARIED TRIUMPHS NOR DREAM MUCH IN THE GREAT GALLERY HUNG WITH
PICTURES OF HIS TRAVELS
BUT FROM ALL THESE LOFTY HALLS OF MEMORY HE
CONSTANTLY ESCAPED TO A REMOTE AND SOLITARY CHAMBER INTO WHICH NO ONE
HAD EVER PENETRATED
BUT MY FATAL EYES BEHIND THE GLASSES FOLLOWED
AND ENTERED WITH HIM AND SAW THAT THE CHAMBER WAS A CHAPEL
IT WAS
DIM AND SILENT AND SWEET WITH PERPETUAL INCENSE THAT BURNED UPON AN
ALTAR BEFORE A PICTURE FOREVER VEILED
THERE WHENEVER I CHANCED TO
LOOK I SAW HIM KNEEL AND PRAY AND THERE BY DAY AND BY NIGHT A
FUNERAL HYMN WAS CHANTED
I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU WILL BE SURPRISED THAT I HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO
REMAIN DEPUTY BOOKKEEPER
MY SPECTACLES REGULATED MY AMBITION AND I
EARLY LEARNED THAT THERE WERE BETTER GODS THAN PLUTUS
THE GLASSES
HAVE LOST MUCH OF THEIR FASCINATION NOW AND I DO NOT OFTEN USE THEM
SOMETIMES THE DESIRE IS IRRESISTIBLE
WHENEVER I AM GREATLY
INTERESTED I AM COMPELLED TO TAKE THEM OUT AND SEE WHAT IT IS THAT I
ADMIRE
AND YET AND YET SAID TITBOTTOM AFTER A PAUSE I AM NOT SURE THAT
I THANK MY GRANDFATHER
PRUE HAD LONG SINCE LAID AWAY HER WORK AND HAD HEARD EVERY WORD OF
THE STORY
I SAW THAT THE DEAR WOMAN HAD YET ONE QUESTION TO ASK AND
HAD BEEN EARNESTLY HOPING TO HEAR SOMETHING THAT WOULD SPARE HER THE
NECESSITY OF ASKING
BUT TITBOTTOM HAD RESUMED HIS USUAL TONE AFTER
THE MOMENTARY EXCITEMENT AND MADE NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO HIMSELF
WE
ALL SAT SILENTLY TITBOTTOM'S EYES FASTENED MUSINGLY UPON THE CARPET
PRUE LOOKING WISTFULLY AT HIM AND I REGARDING BOTH
IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT AND OUR GUEST AROSE TO GO
HE SHOOK HANDS
QUIETLY MADE HIS GRAVE SPANISH BOW TO PRUE AND TAKING HIS HAT WENT
TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR
PRUE AND I ACCOMPANIED HIM
I SAW IN HER EYES
THAT SHE WOULD ASK HER QUESTION
AND AS TITBOTTOM OPENED THE DOOR I
HEARD THE LOW WORDS
AND PRECIOSA
TITBOTTOM PAUSED
HE HAD JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND THE MOONLIGHT
STREAMED OVER HIM AS HE STOOD TURNING BACK TO US
I HAVE SEEN HER BUT ONCE SINCE
IT WAS IN CHURCH AND SHE WAS
KNEELING WITH HER EYES CLOSED SO THAT SHE DID NOT SEE ME
BUT I
RUBBED THE GLASSES WELL AND LOOKED AT HER AND SAW A WHITE LILY
WHOSE STEM WAS BROKEN BUT WHICH WAS FRESH AND LUMINOUS AND
FRAGRANT STILL
THAT WAS A MIRACLE INTERRUPTED PRUE
MADAM IT WAS A MIRACLE REPLIED TITBOTTOM AND FOR THAT ONE SIGHT
I AM DEVOUTLY GRATEFUL FOR MY GRANDFATHER'S GIFT
I SAW THAT ALTHOUGH
A FLOWER MAY HAVE LOST ITS HOLD UPON EARTHLY MOISTURE IT MAY STILL
BLOOM AS SWEETLY FED BY THE DEWS OF HEAVEN
THE DOOR CLOSED AND HE WAS GONE
BUT AS PRUE PUT HER ARM IN MINE AND
WE WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER SHE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU DON'T WEAR SPECTACLES
MY DOUBLE AND HOW HE UNDID ME
BY EDWARD EVERETT HALE 1822 1909
FROM THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY SEPTEMBER 1859
REPUBLISHED IN THE
VOLUME THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY AND OTHER TALES 1868 BY EDWARD
EVERETT HALE LITTLE BROWN CO
IT IS NOT OFTEN THAT I TROUBLE THE READERS OF THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY
I SHOULD NOT TROUBLE THEM NOW BUT FOR THE IMPORTUNITIES OF MY WIFE
WHO FEELS TO INSIST THAT A DUTY TO SOCIETY IS UNFULFILLED TILL I
HAVE TOLD WHY I HAD TO HAVE A DOUBLE AND HOW HE UNDID ME
SHE IS
SURE SHE SAYS THAT INTELLIGENT PERSONS CANNOT UNDERSTAND THAT
PRESSURE UPON PUBLIC SERVANTS WHICH ALONE DRIVES ANY MAN INTO THE
EMPLOYMENT OF A DOUBLE
AND WHILE I FEAR SHE THINKS AT THE BOTTOM OF
HER HEART THAT MY FORTUNES WILL NEVER BE RE MADE SHE HAS A FAINT
HOPE THAT AS ANOTHER RASSELAS I MAY TEACH A LESSON TO FUTURE
PUBLICS FROM WHICH THEY MAY PROFIT THOUGH WE DIE
OWING TO THE
BEHAVIOR OF MY DOUBLE OR IF YOU PLEASE TO THAT PUBLIC PRESSURE
WHICH COMPELLED ME TO EMPLOY HIM I HAVE PLENTY OF LEISURE TO WRITE
THIS COMMUNICATION
I AM OR RATHER WAS A MINISTER OF THE SANDEMANIAN CONNECTION
I WAS
SETTLED IN THE ACTIVE WIDE AWAKE TOWN OF NAGUADAVICK ON ONE OF THE
FINEST WATER POWERS IN MAINE
WE USED TO CALL IT A WESTERN TOWN IN THE
HEART OF THE CIVILIZATION OF NEW ENGLAND
A CHARMING PLACE IT WAS AND
IS
A SPIRITED BRAVE YOUNG PARISH HAD I AND IT SEEMED AS IF WE MIGHT
HAVE ALL THE JOY OF EVENTFUL LIVING TO OUR HEARTS' CONTENT
ALAS HOW LITTLE WE KNEW ON THE DAY OF MY ORDINATION AND IN THOSE
HALCYON MOMENTS OF OUR FIRST HOUSEKEEPING TO BE THE CONFIDENTIAL
FRIEND IN A HUNDRED FAMILIES IN THE TOWN CUTTING THE SOCIAL TRIFLE
AS MY FRIEND HALIBURTON SAYS FROM THE TOP OF THE WHIPPED SYLLABUB TO
THE BOTTOM OF THE SPONGE CAKE WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION TO KEEP
ABREAST OF THE THOUGHT OF THE AGE IN ONE'S STUDY AND TO DO ONE'S BEST
ON SUNDAY TO INTERWEAVE THAT THOUGHT WITH THE ACTIVE LIFE OF AN ACTIVE
TOWN AND TO INSPIRIT BOTH AND MAKE BOTH INFINITE BY GLIMPSES OF THE
ETERNAL GLORY SEEMED SUCH AN EXQUISITE FORELOOK INTO ONE'S LIFE
ENOUGH TO DO AND ALL SO REAL AND SO GRAND IF THIS VISION COULD ONLY
HAVE LASTED
THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS VISION WAS NOT IN ITSELF A DELUSION NOR
INDEED HALF BRIGHT ENOUGH
IF ONE COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN LEFT TO DO HIS
OWN BUSINESS THE VISION WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED ITSELF AND BROUGHT
OUT NEW PARAHELIACAL VISIONS EACH AS BRIGHT AS THE ORIGINAL
THE
MISERY WAS AND IS AS WE FOUND OUT I AND POLLY BEFORE LONG THAT
BESIDES THE VISION AND BESIDES THE USUAL HUMAN AND FINITE FAILURES IN
LIFE SUCH AS BREAKING THE OLD PITCHER THAT CAME OVER IN THE
MAYFLOWER AND PUTTING INTO THE FIRE THE ALPENSTOCK WITH WHICH HER
FATHER CLIMBED MONT BLANC BESIDES THESE I SAY IMITATING THE STYLE
OF ROBINSON CRUSOE THERE WERE PITCHFORKED IN ON US A GREAT
ROWEN HEAP OF HUMBUGS HANDED DOWN FROM SOME UNKNOWN SEED TIME IN
WHICH WE WERE EXPECTED AND I CHIEFLY TO FULFIL CERTAIN PUBLIC
FUNCTIONS BEFORE THE COMMUNITY OF THE CHARACTER OF THOSE FULFILLED BY
THE THIRD ROW OF SUPERNUMERARIES WHO STAND BEHIND THE SEPOYS IN THE
SPECTACLE OF THE CATARACT OF THE GANGES
THEY WERE THE DUTIES IN A
WORD WHICH ONE PERFORMS AS MEMBER OF ONE OR ANOTHER SOCIAL CLASS OR
SUBDIVISION WHOLLY DISTINCT FROM WHAT ONE DOES AS A
BY HIMSELF A
WHAT INVISIBLE POWER PUT THESE FUNCTIONS ON ME IT WOULD BE VERY HARD
TO TELL
BUT SUCH POWER THERE WAS AND IS
AND I HAD NOT BEEN AT WORK A
YEAR BEFORE I FOUND I WAS LIVING TWO LIVES ONE REAL AND ONE MERELY
FUNCTIONAL FOR TWO SETS OF PEOPLE ONE MY PARISH WHOM I LOVED AND
THE OTHER A VAGUE PUBLIC FOR WHOM I DID NOT CARE TWO STRAWS
ALL THIS
WAS IN A VAGUE NOTION WHICH EVERYBODY HAD AND HAS THAT THIS SECOND
LIFE WOULD EVENTUALLY BRING OUT SOME GREAT RESULTS UNKNOWN AT
PRESENT TO SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE
CRAZED BY THIS DUALITY OF LIFE I FIRST READ DR
WIGAN ON THE DUALITY
OF THE BRAIN HOPING THAT I COULD TRAIN ONE SIDE OF MY HEAD TO DO
THESE OUTSIDE JOBS AND THE OTHER TO DO MY INTIMATE AND REAL DUTIES
FOR RICHARD GREENOUGH ONCE TOLD ME THAT IN STUDYING FOR THE STATUE OF
FRANKLIN HE FOUND THAT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GREAT MAN'S FACE WAS
PHILOSOPHIC AND REFLECTIVE AND THE RIGHT SIDE FUNNY AND SMILING
IF
YOU WILL GO AND LOOK AT THE BRONZE STATUE YOU WILL FIND HE HAS
REPEATED THIS OBSERVATION THERE FOR POSTERITY
THE EASTERN PROFILE IS
THE PORTRAIT OF THE STATESMAN FRANKLIN THE WESTERN OF POOR RICHARD
BUT DR
WIGAN DOES NOT GO INTO THESE NICETIES OF THIS SUBJECT AND I
FAILED
IT WAS THEN THAT ON MY WIFE'S SUGGESTION I RESOLVED TO LOOK
OUT FOR A DOUBLE
I WAS AT FIRST SINGULARLY SUCCESSFUL
WE HAPPENED TO BE RECREATING
AT STAFFORD SPRINGS THAT SUMMER
WE RODE OUT ONE DAY FOR ONE OF THE
RELAXATIONS OF THAT WATERING PLACE TO THE GREAT MONSONPON HOUSE
WE
WERE PASSING THROUGH ONE OF THE LARGE HALLS WHEN MY DESTINY WAS
FULFILLED I SAW MY MAN
HE WAS NOT SHAVEN
HE HAD ON NO SPECTACLES
HE WAS DRESSED IN A GREEN
BAIZE ROUNDABOUT AND FADED BLUE OVERALLS WORN SADLY AT THE KNEE
BUT
I SAW AT ONCE THAT HE WAS OF MY HEIGHT FIVE FEET FOUR AND A HALF
HE
HAD BLACK HAIR WORN OFF BY HIS HAT
SO HAVE AND HAVE NOT I
HE
STOOPED IN WALKING
SO DO I
HIS HANDS WERE LARGE AND MINE
AND CHOICEST GIFT OF FATE IN ALL HE HAD NOT A STRAWBERRY MARK ON
HIS LEFT ARM BUT A CUT FROM A JUVENILE BRICKBAT OVER HIS RIGHT EYE
SLIGHTLY AFFECTING THE PLAY OF THAT EYEBROW
READER SO HAVE I MY
FATE WAS SEALED
A WORD WITH MR
HOLLEY ONE OF THE INSPECTORS SETTLED THE WHOLE
THING
IT PROVED THAT THIS DENNIS SHEA WAS A HARMLESS AMIABLE FELLOW
OF THE CLASS KNOWN AS SHIFTLESS WHO HAD SEALED HIS FATE BY MARRYING A
DUMB WIFE WHO WAS AT THAT MOMENT IRONING IN THE LAUNDRY
BEFORE I
LEFT STAFFORD I HAD HIRED BOTH FOR FIVE YEARS
WE HAD APPLIED TO
JUDGE PYNCHON THEN THE PROBATE JUDGE AT SPRINGFIELD TO CHANGE THE
NAME OF DENNIS SHEA TO FREDERIC INGHAM
WE HAD EXPLAINED TO THE JUDGE
WHAT WAS THE PRECISE TRUTH THAT AN ECCENTRIC GENTLEMAN WISHED TO
ADOPT DENNIS UNDER THIS NEW NAME INTO HIS FAMILY
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO
HIM THAT DENNIS MIGHT BE MORE THAN FOURTEEN YEARS OLD
AND THUS TO
SHORTEN THIS PREFACE WHEN WE RETURNED AT NIGHT TO MY PARSONAGE AT
NAGUADAVICK THERE ENTERED MRS
INGHAM HER NEW DUMB LAUNDRESS
MYSELF WHO AM MR
FREDERIC INGHAM AND MY DOUBLE WHO WAS MR
FREDERIC INGHAM BY AS GOOD RIGHT AS I
OH THE FUN WE HAD THE NEXT MORNING IN SHAVING HIS BEARD TO MY
PATTERN CUTTING HIS HAIR TO MATCH MINE AND TEACHING HIM HOW TO WEAR
AND HOW TO TAKE OFF GOLD BOWED SPECTACLES REALLY THEY WERE
ELECTROPLATE AND THE GLASS WAS PLAIN FOR THE POOR FELLOW'S EYES WERE
EXCELLENT
THEN IN FOUR SUCCESSIVE AFTERNOONS I TAUGHT HIM FOUR
SPEECHES
I HAD FOUND THESE WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH FOR THE
SUPERNUMERARY SEPOY LINE OF LIFE AND IT WAS WELL FOR ME THEY WERE
FOR THOUGH HE WAS GOOD NATURED HE WAS VERY SHIFTLESS AND IT WAS AS
OUR NATIONAL PROVERB SAYS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO TEACH HIM
BUT AT
THE END OF THE NEXT WEEK HE COULD SAY WITH QUITE MY EASY AND FRISKY
AIR
1
VERY WELL THANK YOU
AND YOU THIS FOR AN ANSWER TO CASUAL
SALUTATIONS
2
I AM VERY GLAD YOU LIKED IT
3
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH SAID AND ON THE WHOLE SO WELL SAID THAT
I WILL NOT OCCUPY THE TIME
4
I AGREE IN GENERAL WITH MY FRIEND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
ROOM
AT FIRST I HAD A FEELING THAT I WAS GOING TO BE AT GREAT COST FOR
CLOTHING HIM
BUT IT PROVED OF COURSE AT ONCE THAT WHENEVER HE WAS
OUT I SHOULD BE AT HOME
AND I WENT DURING THE BRIGHT PERIOD OF HIS
SUCCESS TO SO FEW OF THOSE AWFUL PAGEANTS WHICH REQUIRE A BLACK
DRESS COAT AND WHAT THE UNGODLY CALL AFTER MR
DICKENS A WHITE
CHOKER THAT IN THE HAPPY RETREAT OF MY OWN DRESSING GOWNS AND JACKETS
MY DAYS WENT BY AS HAPPILY AND CHEAPLY AS THOSE OF ANOTHER THALABA
AND POLLY DECLARES THERE WAS NEVER A YEAR WHEN THE TAILORING COST SO
LITTLE
HE LIVED DENNIS NOT THALABA IN HIS WIFE'S ROOM OVER THE
KITCHEN
HE HAD ORDERS NEVER TO SHOW HIMSELF AT THAT WINDOW
WHEN HE
APPEARED IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE I RETIRED TO MY SANCTISSIMUM AND
MY DRESSING GOWN
IN SHORT THE DUTCHMAN AND HIS WIFE IN THE OLD
WEATHER BOX HAD NOT LESS TO DO WITH EACH OTHER THAN HE AND I
HE
MADE THE FURNACE FIRE AND SPLIT THE WOOD BEFORE DAYLIGHT THEN HE WENT
TO SLEEP AGAIN AND SLEPT LATE THEN CAME FOR ORDERS WITH A RED SILK
BANDANNA TIED ROUND HIS HEAD WITH HIS OVERALLS ON AND HIS DRESS COAT
AND SPECTACLES OFF
IF WE HAPPENED TO BE INTERRUPTED NO ONE GUESSED
THAT HE WAS FREDERIC INGHAM AS WELL AS I AND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THERE GREW UP AN IMPRESSION THAT THE MINISTER'S IRISHMAN WORKED
DAY TIMES IN THE FACTORY VILLAGE AT NEW COVENTRY
AFTER I HAD GIVEN
HIM HIS ORDERS I NEVER SAW HIM TILL THE NEXT DAY
I LAUNCHED HIM BY SENDING HIM TO A MEETING OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT BOARD
THE ENLIGHTENMENT BOARD CONSISTS OF SEVENTY FOUR MEMBERS OF WHOM
SIXTY SEVEN ARE NECESSARY TO FORM A QUORUM
ONE BECOMES A MEMBER UNDER
THE REGULATIONS LAID DOWN IN OLD JUDGE DUDLEY'S WILL
I BECAME ONE BY
BEING ORDAINED PASTOR OF A CHURCH IN NAGUADAVICK
YOU SEE YOU CANNOT
HELP YOURSELF IF YOU WOULD
AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME WE HAD HAD FOUR
SUCCESSIVE MEETINGS AVERAGING FOUR HOURS EACH WHOLLY OCCUPIED IN
WHIPPING IN A QUORUM
AT THE FIRST ONLY ELEVEN MEN WERE PRESENT AT
THE NEXT BY FORCE OF THREE CIRCULARS TWENTY SEVEN AT THE THIRD
THANKS TO TWO DAYS' CANVASSING BY AUCHMUTY AND MYSELF BEGGING MEN TO
COME WE HAD SIXTY
HALF THE OTHERS WERE IN EUROPE
BUT WITHOUT A
QUORUM WE COULD DO NOTHING
ALL THE REST OF US WAITED GRIMLY FOR OUR
FOUR HOURS AND ADJOURNED WITHOUT ANY ACTION
AT THE FOURTH MEETING WE
HAD FLAGGED AND ONLY GOT FIFTY NINE TOGETHER
BUT ON THE FIRST
APPEARANCE OF MY DOUBLE WHOM I SENT ON THIS FATAL MONDAY TO THE FIFTH
MEETING HE WAS THE SIXTY SEVENTH MAN WHO ENTERED THE ROOM
HE WAS
GREETED WITH A STORM OF APPLAUSE THE POOR FELLOW HAD MISSED HIS
WAY READ THE STREET SIGNS ILL THROUGH HIS SPECTACLES VERY ILL IN
FACT WITHOUT THEM AND HAD NOT DARED TO INQUIRE
HE ENTERED THE
ROOM FINDING THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY HOLDING TO THEIR CHAIRS TWO
JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT WHO WERE ALSO MEMBERS EX OFFICIO AND
WERE BEGGING LEAVE TO GO AWAY
ON HIS ENTRANCE ALL WAS CHANGED
PRESTO THE BY LAWS WERE AMENDED AND THE WESTERN PROPERTY WAS GIVEN
AWAY
NOBODY STOPPED TO CONVERSE WITH HIM
HE VOTED AS I HAD CHARGED
HIM TO DO IN EVERY INSTANCE WITH THE MINORITY
I WON NEW LAURELS AS
A MAN OF SENSE THOUGH A LITTLE UNPUNCTUAL AND DENNIS ALIAS
INGHAM RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE ASTONISHED TO SEE WITH HOW LITTLE
WISDOM THE WORLD IS GOVERNED
HE CUT A FEW OF MY PARISHIONERS IN THE
STREET BUT HE HAD HIS GLASSES OFF AND I AM KNOWN TO BE NEARSIGHTED
EVENTUALLY HE RECOGNIZED THEM MORE READILY THAN I
I SET HIM AGAIN AT THE EXHIBITION OF THE NEW COVENTRY ACADEMY AND
HERE HE UNDERTOOK A SPEAKING PART AS IN MY BOYISH WORLDLY DAYS I
REMEMBER THE BILLS USED TO SAY OF MLLE
CELESTE
WE ARE ALL TRUSTEES
OF THE NEW COVENTRY ACADEMY AND THERE HAS LATELY BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF
FEELING BECAUSE THE SANDEMANIAN TRUSTEES DID NOT REGULARLY ATTEND THE
EXHIBITIONS
IT HAS BEEN INTIMATED INDEED THAT THE SANDEMANIANS ARE
LEANING TOWARDS FREE WILL AND THAT WE HAVE THEREFORE NEGLECTED
THESE SEMI ANNUAL EXHIBITIONS WHILE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT AUCHMUTY
LAST YEAR WENT TO COMMENCEMENT AT WATERVILLE
NOW THE HEAD MASTER AT
NEW COVENTRY IS A REAL GOOD FELLOW WHO KNOWS A SANSKRIT ROOT WHEN HE
SEES IT AND OFTEN CRACKS ETYMOLOGIES WITH ME SO THAT IN STRICTNESS
I OUGHT TO GO TO THEIR EXHIBITIONS
BUT THINK READER OF SITTING
THROUGH THREE LONG JULY DAYS IN THAT ACADEMY CHAPEL FOLLOWING THE
PROGRAM FROM
TUESDAY MORNING
ENGLISH COMPOSITION
SUNSHINE
MISS JONES
ROUND TO
TRIO ON THREE PIANOS
DUEL FROM OPERA OF MIDSHIPMAN EASY
MARRYATT
COMING IN AT NINE THURSDAY EVENING THINK OF THIS READER FOR MEN
WHO KNOW THE WORLD IS TRYING TO GO BACKWARD AND WHO WOULD GIVE THEIR
LIVES IF THEY COULD HELP IT ON WELL THE DOUBLE HAD SUCCEEDED SO WELL
AT THE BOARD THAT I SENT HIM TO THE ACADEMY
SHADE OF PLATO
PARDON HE ARRIVED EARLY ON TUESDAY WHEN INDEED FEW BUT MOTHERS
AND CLERGYMEN ARE GENERALLY EXPECTED AND RETURNED IN THE EVENING TO
US COVERED WITH HONORS
HE HAD DINED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE
CHAIRMAN AND HE SPOKE IN HIGH TERMS OF THE REPAST
THE CHAIRMAN HAD
EXPRESSED HIS INTEREST IN THE FRENCH CONVERSATION
I AM VERY GLAD YOU
LIKED IT SAID DENNIS AND THE POOR CHAIRMAN ABASHED SUPPOSED THE
ACCENT HAD BEEN WRONG
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE GENTLEMEN PRESENT
HAD BEEN CALLED UPON FOR SPEECHES THE REV
FREDERIC INGHAM FIRST AS
IT HAPPENED UPON WHICH DENNIS HAD RISEN AND HAD SAID THERE HAS
BEEN SO MUCH SAID AND ON THE WHOLE SO WELL SAID THAT I WILL NOT
OCCUPY THE TIME THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED BECAUSE DR
DABNEY THE
YEAR BEFORE HAD GIVEN THEM AT THIS OCCASION A SCOLDING ON IMPROPRIETY
OF BEHAVIOR AT LYCEUM LECTURES
THEY ALL DECLARED MR
INGHAM WAS A
LOVE AND SO HANDSOME DENNIS IS GOOD LOOKING THREE OF THEM WITH
ARMS BEHIND THE OTHERS' WAISTS FOLLOWED HIM UP TO THE WAGON HE RODE
HOME IN AND A LITTLE GIRL WITH A BLUE SASH HAD BEEN SENT TO GIVE HIM
A ROSEBUD
AFTER THIS DEBUT IN SPEAKING HE WENT TO THE EXHIBITION FOR
TWO DAYS MORE TO THE MUTUAL SATISFACTION OF ALL CONCERNED
INDEED
POLLY REPORTED THAT HE HAD PRONOUNCED THE TRUSTEES' DINNERS OF A
HIGHER GRADE THAN THOSE OF THE PARSONAGE
WHEN THE NEXT TERM BEGAN I
FOUND SIX OF THE ACADEMY GIRLS HAD OBTAINED PERMISSION TO COME ACROSS
THE RIVER AND ATTEND OUR CHURCH
BUT THIS ARRANGEMENT DID NOT LONG
CONTINUE
AFTER THIS HE WENT TO SEVERAL COMMENCEMENTS FOR ME AND ATE THE
DINNERS PROVIDED HE SAT THROUGH THREE OF OUR QUARTERLY CONVENTIONS
FOR ME ALWAYS VOTING JUDICIOUSLY BY THE SIMPLE RULE MENTIONED ABOVE
OF SIDING WITH THE MINORITY
AND I MEANWHILE WHO HAD BEFORE BEEN
LOSING CASTE AMONG MY FRIENDS AS HOLDING MYSELF ALOOF FROM THE
ASSOCIATIONS OF THE BODY BEGAN TO RISE IN EVERYBODY'S FAVOR
INGHAM'S A GOOD FELLOW ALWAYS ON HAND NEVER TALKS MUCH BUT DOES
THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME IS NOT AS UNPUNCTUAL AS HE USED
TO BE HE COMES EARLY AND SITS THROUGH TO THE END HE HAS GOT OVER
HIS OLD TALKATIVE HABIT TOO
I SPOKE TO A FRIEND OF HIS ABOUT IT
ONCE AND I THINK INGHAM TOOK IT KINDLY ETC ETC
THIS VOTING POWER OF DENNIS WAS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AT THE QUARTERLY
MEETINGS OF THE PROPRIETORS OF THE NAGUADAVICK FERRY
MY WIFE
INHERITED FROM HER FATHER SOME SHARES IN THAT ENTERPRISE WHICH IS NOT
YET FULLY DEVELOPED THOUGH IT DOUBTLESS WILL BECOME A VERY VALUABLE
PROPERTY
THE LAW OF MAINE THEN FORBADE STOCKHOLDERS TO APPEAR BY
PROXY AT SUCH MEETINGS
POLLY DISLIKED TO GO NOT BEING IN FACT A
HENS' RIGHTS HEN AND TRANSFERRED HER STOCK TO ME
I AFTER GOING
ONCE DISLIKED IT MORE THAN SHE
BUT DENNIS WENT TO THE NEXT MEETING
AND LIKED IT VERY MUCH
HE SAID THE ARMCHAIRS WERE GOOD THE COLLATION
GOOD AND THE FREE RIDES TO STOCKHOLDERS PLEASANT
HE WAS A LITTLE
FRIGHTENED WHEN THEY FIRST TOOK HIM UPON ONE OF THE FERRY BOATS BUT
AFTER TWO OR THREE QUARTERLY MEETINGS HE BECAME QUITE BRAVE
THUS FAR I NEVER HAD ANY DIFFICULTY WITH HIM
INDEED BEING OF THAT
TYPE WHICH IS CALLED SHIFTLESS HE WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO BE TOLD DAILY
WHAT TO DO AND TO BE CHARGED NOT TO BE FORTHPUTTING OR IN ANY WAY
ORIGINAL IN HIS DISCHARGE OF THAT DUTY
HE LEARNED HOWEVER TO
DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE LINES OF HIS LIFE AND VERY MUCH PREFERRED
THESE STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS AND TRUSTEES' DINNERS AND COMMENCEMENT
COLLATIONS TO ANOTHER SET OF OCCASIONS FROM WHICH HE USED TO BEG OFF
MOST PITEOUSLY
OUR EXCELLENT BROTHER DR
FILLMORE HAD TAKEN A
NOTION AT THIS TIME THAT OUR SANDEMANIAN CHURCHES NEEDED MORE
EXPRESSION OF MUTUAL SYMPATHY
HE INSISTED UPON IT THAT WE WERE
REMISS
HE SAID THAT IF THE BISHOP CAME TO PREACH AT NAGUADAVICK
ALL THE EPISCOPAL CLERGY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE PRESENT IF DR
POND
CAME ALL THE CONGREGATIONAL CLERGYMEN TURNED OUT TO HEAR HIM IF DR
NICHOLS ALL THE UNITARIANS AND HE THOUGHT WE OWED IT TO EACH OTHER
THAT WHENEVER THERE WAS AN OCCASIONAL SERVICE AT A SANDEMANIAN
CHURCH THE OTHER BRETHREN SHOULD ALL IF POSSIBLE ATTEND
IT LOOKED
WELL IF NOTHING MORE
NOW THIS REALLY MEANT THAT I HAD NOT BEEN TO
HEAR ONE OF DR
FILLMORE'S LECTURES ON THE ETHNOLOGY OF RELIGION
HE
FORGOT THAT HE DID NOT HEAR ONE OF MY COURSE ON THE SANDEMANIANISM OF
ANSELM
BUT I FELT BADLY WHEN HE SAID IT AND AFTERWARDS I ALWAYS MADE
DENNIS GO TO HEAR ALL THE BRETHREN PREACH WHEN I WAS NOT PREACHING
MYSELF
THIS WAS WHAT HE TOOK EXCEPTIONS TO THE ONLY THING AS I
SAID WHICH HE EVER DID EXCEPT TO
NOW CAME THE ADVANTAGE OF HIS LONG
MORNING NAP AND OF THE GREEN TEA WITH WHICH POLLY SUPPLIED THE
KITCHEN
BUT HE WOULD PLEAD SO HUMBLY TO BE LET OFF ONLY FROM ONE
OR TWO I NEVER EXCEPTED HIM HOWEVER
I KNEW THE LECTURES WERE OF
VALUE AND I THOUGHT IT BEST HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THE CONNECTION
POLLY IS MORE RASH THAN I AM AS THE READER HAS OBSERVED IN THE OUTSET
OF THIS MEMOIR
SHE RISKED DENNIS ONE NIGHT UNDER THE EYES OF HER OWN
SEX
GOVERNOR GORGES HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY KIND TO US AND WHEN HE GAVE
HIS GREAT ANNUAL PARTY TO THE TOWN ASKED US
I CONFESS I HATED TO GO
I WAS DEEP IN THE NEW VOLUME OF PFEIFFER'S MYSTICS WHICH HALIBURTON
HAD JUST SENT ME FROM BOSTON
BUT HOW RUDE SAID POLLY NOT TO
RETURN THE GOVERNOR'S CIVILITY AND MRS
GORGES'S WHEN THEY WILL BE
SURE TO ASK WHY YOU ARE AWAY STILL I DEMURRED AND AT LAST SHE WITH
THE WIT OF EVE AND OF SEMIRAMIS CONJOINED LET ME OFF BY SAYING THAT
IF I WOULD GO IN WITH HER AND SUSTAIN THE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH
THE GOVERNOR AND THE LADIES STAYING THERE SHE WOULD RISK DENNIS FOR
THE REST OF THE EVENING
AND THAT WAS JUST WHAT WE DID
SHE TOOK
DENNIS IN TRAINING ALL THAT AFTERNOON INSTRUCTED HIM IN FASHIONABLE
CONVERSATION CAUTIONED HIM AGAINST THE TEMPTATIONS OF THE
SUPPER TABLE AND AT NINE IN THE EVENING HE DROVE US ALL DOWN IN THE
CARRYALL
I MADE THE GRAND STAR ENTRE WITH POLLY AND THE PRETTY
WALTON GIRLS WHO WERE STAYING WITH US
WE HAD PUT DENNIS INTO A GREAT
ROUGH TOP COAT WITHOUT HIS GLASSES AND THE GIRLS NEVER DREAMED IN
THE DARKNESS OF LOOKING AT HIM
HE SAT IN THE CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR
WHILE WE ENTERED
I DID THE AGREEABLE TO MRS
GORGES WAS INTRODUCED
TO HER NIECE
MISS FERNANDA I COMPLIMENTED JUDGE JEFFRIES ON HIS
DECISION IN THE GREAT CASE OF D'AULNAY VS LACONIA MINING CO I
STEPPED INTO THE DRESSING ROOM FOR A MOMENT STEPPED OUT FOR
ANOTHER WALKED HOME AFTER A NOD WITH DENNIS AND TYING THE HORSE TO
A PUMP AND WHILE I WALKED HOME MR
FREDERIC INGHAM MY DOUBLE
STEPPED IN THROUGH THE LIBRARY INTO THE GORGES'S GRAND SALOON
OH POLLY DIED OF LAUGHING AS SHE TOLD ME OF IT AT MIDNIGHT AND EVEN
HERE WHERE I HAVE TO TEACH MY HANDS TO HEW THE BEECH FOR STAKES TO
FENCE OUR CAVE SHE DIES OF LAUGHING AS SHE RECALLS IT AND SAYS THAT
SINGLE OCCASION WAS WORTH ALL WE HAVE PAID FOR IT
GALLANT EVE THAT
SHE IS SHE JOINED DENNIS AT THE LIBRARY DOOR AND IN AN INSTANT
PRESENTED HIM TO DR
OCHTERLONG FROM BALTIMORE WHO WAS ON A VISIT IN
TOWN AND WAS TALKING WITH HER AS DENNIS CAME IN
MR
INGHAM WOULD
LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOU WERE TELLING US ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS AMONG THE
GERMAN POPULATION AND DENNIS BOWED AND SAID IN SPITE OF A SCOWL
FROM POLLY I'M VERY GLAD YOU LIKED IT BUT DR
OCHTERLONG DID NOT
OBSERVE AND PLUNGED INTO THE TIDE OF EXPLANATION DENNIS LISTENING
LIKE A PRIME MINISTER AND BOWING LIKE A MANDARIN WHICH IS I
SUPPOSE THE SAME THING
POLLY DECLARED IT WAS JUST LIKE HALIBURTON'S
LATIN CONVERSATION WITH THE HUNGARIAN MINISTER OF WHICH HE IS VERY
FOND OF TELLING
QUOENE SIT HISTORIA REFORMATIONIS IN UNGARI
QUOTH HALIBURTON AFTER SOME THOUGHT
AND HIS CONFRRE REPLIED
GALLANTLY IN SECULO DECIMO TERTIO ETC ETC ETC AND FROM
DECIMO TERTIO WHICH MEANS IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY MY DEAR
LITTLE BELL AND CORAL READER
YOU HAVE RIGHTLY GUESSED THAT THE
QUESTION MEANS WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE REFORMATION IN HUNGARY
TO THE NINETEENTH CENTURY AND A HALF LASTED TILL THE OYSTERS CAME
SO
WAS IT THAT BEFORE DR
OCHTERLONG CAME TO THE SUCCESS OR NEAR IT
GOVERNOR GORGES CAME TO DENNIS AND ASKED HIM TO HAND MRS
JEFFRIES
DOWN TO SUPPER A REQUEST WHICH HE HEARD WITH GREAT JOY
POLLY WAS SKIPPING ROUND THE ROOM I GUESS GAY AS A LARK
AUCHMUTY
CAME TO HER IN PITY FOR POOR INGHAM WHO WAS SO BORED BY THE STUPID
PUNDIT AND AUCHMUTY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I STOOD IT SO LONG
BUT
WHEN DENNIS TOOK MRS
JEFFRIES DOWN POLLY COULD NOT RESIST STANDING
NEAR THEM
HE WAS A LITTLE FLUSTERED TILL THE SIGHT OF THE EATABLES
AND DRINKABLES GAVE HIM THE SAME MERCIAN COURAGE WHICH IT GAVE
DIGGORY
A LITTLE EXCITED THEN HE ATTEMPTED ONE OR TWO OF HIS
SPEECHES TO THE JUDGE'S LADY
BUT LITTLE HE KNEW HOW HARD IT WAS TO
GET IN EVEN A PROMPTU THERE EDGEWISE
VERY WELL I THANK YOU SAID
HE AFTER THE EATING ELEMENTS WERE ADJUSTED AND YOU AND THEN DID
NOT HE HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT THE MUMPS AND THE MEASLES AND ARNICA AND
BELLADONNA AND CHAMOMILE FLOWER AND DODECATHEM TILL SHE CHANGED
OYSTERS FOR SALAD AND THEN ABOUT THE OLD PRACTICE AND THE NEW AND
WHAT HER SISTER SAID AND WHAT HER SISTER'S FRIEND SAID AND WHAT THE
PHYSICIAN TO HER SISTER'S FRIEND SAID AND THEN WHAT WAS SAID BY THE
BROTHER OF THE SISTER OF THE PHYSICIAN OF THE FRIEND OF HER SISTER
EXACTLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN IN OLLENDORFF THERE WAS A MOMENT'S PAUSE
AS SHE DECLINED CHAMPAGNE
I AM VERY GLAD YOU LIKED IT SAID DENNIS
AGAIN WHICH HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE SAID BUT TO ONE WHO COMPLIMENTED A
SERMON
OH YOU ARE SO SHARP MR
INGHAM NO I NEVER DRINK ANY WINE
AT ALL EXCEPT SOMETIMES IN SUMMER A LITTLE CURRANT SPIRITS FROM OUR
OWN CURRANTS YOU KNOW
MY OWN MOTHER THAT IS I CALL HER MY OWN
MOTHER BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DO NOT REMEMBER ETC ETC ETC TILL
THEY CAME TO THE CANDIED ORANGE AT THE END OF THE FEAST WHEN DENNIS
RATHER CONFUSED THOUGHT HE MUST SAY SOMETHING AND TRIED NO
4 I
AGREE IN GENERAL WITH MY FRIEND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHICH
HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE SAID BUT AT A PUBLIC MEETING
BUT MRS
JEFFRIES
WHO NEVER LISTENS EXPECTING TO UNDERSTAND CAUGHT HIM UP INSTANTLY
WITH WELL I'M SURE MY HUSBAND RETURNS THE COMPLIMENT HE ALWAYS
AGREES WITH YOU THOUGH WE DO WORSHIP WITH THE METHODISTS BUT YOU
KNOW MR
INGHAM ETC ETC ETC TILL THE MOVE WAS MADE UPSTAIRS
AND AS DENNIS LED HER THROUGH THE HALL HE WAS SCARCELY UNDERSTOOD BY
ANY BUT POLLY AS HE SAID THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH SAID AND ON THE
WHOLE SO WELL SAID THAT I WILL NOT OCCUPY THE TIME
HIS GREAT RESOURCE THE REST OF THE EVENING WAS STANDING IN THE
LIBRARY CARRYING ON ANIMATED CONVERSATIONS WITH ONE AND ANOTHER IN
MUCH THE SAME WAY
POLLY HAD INITIATED HIM IN THE MYSTERIES OF A
DISCOVERY OF MINE THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO FINISH YOUR SENTENCE IN
A CROWD BUT BY A SORT OF MUMBLE OMITTING SIBILANTS AND DENTALS
THIS INDEED IF YOUR WORDS FAIL YOU ANSWERS EVEN IN PUBLIC EXTEMPORE
SPEECH BUT BETTER WHERE OTHER TALKING IS GOING ON
THUS WE MISSED
YOU AT THE NATURAL HISTORY SOCIETY INGHAM INGHAM REPLIES I AM
VERY GLIGLOGLUM THAT IS THAT YOU WERE M M M M M BY GRADUALLY
DROPPING THE VOICE THE INTERLOCUTOR IS COMPELLED TO SUPPLY THE
ANSWER
MRS
INGHAM I HOPE YOUR FRIEND AUGUSTA IS BETTER AUGUSTA
HAS NOT BEEN ILL
POLLY CANNOT THINK OF EXPLAINING HOWEVER AND
ANSWERS THANK YOU MA'AM SHE IS VERY REARASON WEWAHWEWOB IN LOWER
AND LOWER TONES
AND MRS
THROCKMORTON WHO FORGOT THE SUBJECT OF
WHICH SHE SPOKE AS SOON AS SHE ASKED THE QUESTION IS QUITE
SATISFIED
DENNIS COULD SEE INTO THE CARD ROOM AND CAME TO POLLY TO
ASK IF HE MIGHT NOT GO AND PLAY ALL FOURS
BUT OF COURSE SHE STERNLY
REFUSED
AT MIDNIGHT THEY CAME HOME DELIGHTEDLY POLLY AS I SAID
WILD TO TELL ME THE STORY OF VICTORY ONLY BOTH THE PRETTY WALTON
GIRLS SAID COUSIN FREDERIC YOU DID NOT COME NEAR ME ALL THE
EVENING
WE ALWAYS CALLED HIM DENNIS AT HOME FOR CONVENIENCE THOUGH HIS REAL
NAME WAS FREDERIC INGHAM AS I HAVE EXPLAINED
WHEN THE ELECTION DAY
CAME ROUND HOWEVER I FOUND THAT BY SOME ACCIDENT THERE WAS ONLY ONE
FREDERIC INGHAM'S NAME ON THE VOTING LIST AND AS I WAS QUITE BUSY
THAT DAY IN WRITING SOME FOREIGN LETTERS TO HALLE I THOUGHT I WOULD
FOREGO MY PRIVILEGE OF SUFFRAGE AND STAY QUIETLY AT HOME TELLING
DENNIS THAT HE MIGHT USE THE RECORD ON THE VOTING LIST AND VOTE
I
GAVE HIM A TICKET WHICH I TOLD HIM HE MIGHT USE IF HE LIKED TO
THAT
WAS THAT VERY SHARP ELECTION IN MAINE WHICH THE READERS OF THE
ATLANTIC SO WELL REMEMBER AND IT HAD BEEN INTIMATED IN PUBLIC THAT
THE MINISTERS WOULD DO WELL NOT TO APPEAR AT THE POLLS
OF COURSE
AFTER THAT WE HAD TO APPEAR BY SELF OR PROXY
STILL NAGUADAVICK WAS
NOT THEN A CITY AND THIS STANDING IN A DOUBLE QUEUE AT TOWNMEETING
SEVERAL HOURS TO VOTE WAS A BORE OF THE FIRST WATER AND SO WHEN I
FOUND THAT THERE WAS BUT ONE FREDERIC INGHAM ON THE LIST AND THAT ONE
OF US MUST GIVE UP I STAYED AT HOME AND FINISHED THE LETTERS WHICH
INDEED PROCURED FOR FOTHERGILL HIS COVETED APPOINTMENT OF PROFESSOR
OF ASTRONOMY AT LEAVENWORTH AND I GAVE DENNIS AS WE CALLED HIM THE
CHANCE
SOMETHING IN THE MATTER GAVE A GOOD DEAL OF POPULARITY TO THE
FREDERIC INGHAM NAME AND AT THE ADJOURNED ELECTION NEXT WEEK
FREDERIC INGHAM WAS CHOSEN TO THE LEGISLATURE
WHETHER THIS WAS I OR
DENNIS I NEVER REALLY KNEW
MY FRIENDS SEEMED TO THINK IT WAS I BUT
I FELT THAT AS DENNIS HAD DONE THE POPULAR THING HE WAS ENTITLED TO
THE HONOR SO I SENT HIM TO AUGUSTA WHEN THE TIME CAME AND HE TOOK
THE OATHS
AND A VERY VALUABLE MEMBER HE MADE
THEY APPOINTED HIM ON
THE COMMITTEE ON PARISHES BUT I WROTE A LETTER FOR HIM RESIGNING ON
THE GROUND THAT HE TOOK AN INTEREST IN OUR CLAIM TO THE STUMPAGE IN
THE MINISTER'S SIXTEENTHS OF GORE A NEXT NO
7 IN THE 10TH RANGE
HE
NEVER MADE ANY SPEECHES AND ALWAYS VOTED WITH THE MINORITY WHICH WAS
WHAT HE WAS SENT TO DO
HE MADE ME AND HIMSELF A GREAT MANY GOOD
FRIENDS SOME OF WHOM I DID NOT AFTERWARDS RECOGNIZE AS QUICKLY AS
DENNIS DID MY PARISHIONERS
ON ONE OR TWO OCCASIONS WHEN THERE WAS
WOOD TO SAW AT HOME I KEPT HIM AT HOME BUT I TOOK THOSE OCCASIONS TO
GO TO AUGUSTA MYSELF
FINDING MYSELF OFTEN IN HIS VACANT SEAT AT THESE
TIMES I WATCHED THE PROCEEDINGS WITH A GOOD DEAL OF CARE AND ONCE
WAS SO MUCH EXCITED THAT I DELIVERED MY SOMEWHAT CELEBRATED SPEECH ON
THE CENTRAL SCHOOL DISTRICT QUESTION A SPEECH OF WHICH THE STATE OF
MAINE PRINTED SOME EXTRA COPIES
I BELIEVE THERE IS NO FORMAL RULE
PERMITTING STRANGERS TO SPEAK BUT NO ONE OBJECTED
DENNIS HIMSELF AS I SAID NEVER SPOKE AT ALL
BUT OUR EXPERIENCE THIS
SESSION LED ME TO THINK THAT IF BY SOME SUCH GENERAL UNDERSTANDING
AS THE REPORTS SPEAK OF IN LEGISLATION DAILY EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS
MIGHT LEAVE A DOUBLE TO SIT THROUGH THOSE DEADLY SESSIONS AND ANSWER
TO ROLL CALLS AND DO THE LEGITIMATE PARTY VOTING WHICH APPEARS
STEREOTYPED IN THE REGULAR LIST OF ASHE BOCOCK BLACK ETC WE
SHOULD GAIN DECIDEDLY IN WORKING POWER
AS THINGS STAND THE SADDEST
STATE PRISON I EVER VISIT IS THAT REPRESENTATIVES' CHAMBER IN
WASHINGTON
IF A MAN LEAVES FOR AN HOUR TWENTY CORRESPONDENTS MAY
BE HOWLING WHERE WAS MR
PRENDERGAST WHEN THE OREGON BILL PASSED
AND IF POOR PRENDERGAST STAYS THERE CERTAINLY THE WORST USE YOU CAN
MAKE OF A MAN IS TO PUT HIM IN PRISON
I KNOW INDEED THAT PUBLIC MEN OF THE HIGHEST RANK HAVE RESORTED TO
THIS EXPEDIENT LONG AGO
DUMAS'S NOVEL OF THE IRON MASK TURNS ON THE
BRUTAL IMPRISONMENT OF LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH'S DOUBLE
THERE SEEMS
LITTLE DOUBT IN OUR OWN HISTORY THAT IT WAS THE REAL GENERAL PIERCE
WHO SHED TEARS WHEN THE DELEGATE FROM LAWRENCE EXPLAINED TO HIM THE
SUFFERINGS OF THE PEOPLE THERE AND ONLY GENERAL PIERCE'S DOUBLE WHO
HAD GIVEN THE ORDERS FOR THE ASSAULT ON THAT TOWN WHICH WAS INVADED
THE NEXT DAY
MY CHARMING FRIEND GEORGE WITHERS HAS I AM ALMOST
SURE A DOUBLE WHO PREACHES HIS AFTERNOON SERMONS FOR HIM
THIS IS
THE REASON THAT THE THEOLOGY OFTEN VARIES SO FROM THAT OF THE
FORENOON
BUT THAT DOUBLE IS ALMOST AS CHARMING AS THE ORIGINAL
SOME
OF THE MOST WELL DEFINED MEN WHO STAND OUT MOST PROMINENTLY ON THE
BACKGROUND OF HISTORY ARE IN THIS WAY STEREOSCOPIC MEN WHO OWE THEIR
DISTINCT RELIEF TO THE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DOUBLES
ALL
THIS I KNOW
MY PRESENT SUGGESTION IS SIMPLY THE GREAT EXTENSION OF
THE SYSTEM SO THAT ALL PUBLIC MACHINE WORK MAY BE DONE BY IT
BUT I SEE I LOITER ON MY STORY WHICH IS RUSHING TO THE PLUNGE
LET ME
STOP AN INSTANT MORE HOWEVER TO RECALL WERE IT ONLY TO MYSELF THAT
CHARMING YEAR WHILE ALL WAS YET WELL
AFTER THE DOUBLE HAD BECOME A
MATTER OF COURSE FOR NEARLY TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE HE UNDID ME WHAT A
YEAR IT WAS FULL OF ACTIVE LIFE FULL OF HAPPY LOVE OF THE HARDEST
WORK OF THE SWEETEST SLEEP AND THE FULFILMENT OF SO MANY OF THE
FRESH ASPIRATIONS AND DREAMS OF BOYHOOD DENNIS WENT TO EVERY
SCHOOL COMMITTEE MEETING AND SAT THROUGH ALL THOSE LATE WRANGLINGS
WHICH USED TO KEEP ME UP TILL MIDNIGHT AND AWAKE TILL MORNING
HE
ATTENDED ALL THE LECTURES TO WHICH FOREIGN EXILES SENT ME TICKETS
BEGGING ME TO COME FOR THE LOVE OF HEAVEN AND OF BOHEMIA
HE ACCEPTED
AND USED ALL THE TICKETS FOR CHARITY CONCERTS WHICH WERE SENT TO ME
HE APPEARED EVERYWHERE WHERE IT WAS SPECIALLY DESIRABLE THAT OUR
DENOMINATION OR OUR PARTY OR OUR CLASS OR OUR FAMILY OR
OUR STREET OR OUR TOWN OR OUR COUNTRY OR OUR STATE SHOULD
BE FULLY REPRESENTED
AND I FELL BACK TO THAT CHARMING LIFE WHICH IN
BOYHOOD ONE DREAMS OF WHEN HE SUPPOSES HE SHALL DO HIS OWN DUTY AND
MAKE HIS OWN SACRIFICES WITHOUT BEING TIED UP WITH THOSE OF OTHER
PEOPLE
MY RUSTY SANSKRIT ARABIC HEBREW GREEK LATIN FRENCH
ITALIAN SPANISH GERMAN AND ENGLISH BEGAN TO TAKE POLISH
HEAVENS
HOW LITTLE I HAD DONE WITH THEM WHILE I ATTENDED TO MY PUBLIC
DUTIES MY CALLS ON MY PARISHIONERS BECAME THE FRIENDLY FREQUENT
HOMELIKE SOCIABILITIES THEY WERE MEANT TO BE INSTEAD OF THE HARD WORK
OF A MAN GOADED TO DESPERATION BY THE SIGHT OF HIS LISTS OF ARREARS
AND PREACHING WHAT A LUXURY PREACHING WAS WHEN I HAD ON SUNDAY THE
WHOLE RESULT OF AN INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL WEEK FROM WHICH TO SPEAK TO A
PEOPLE WHOM ALL THAT WEEK I HAD BEEN MEETING AS HAND TO HAND FRIEND I
NEVER TIRED ON SUNDAY AND WAS IN CONDITION TO LEAVE THE SERMON AT
HOME IF I CHOSE AND PREACH IT EXTEMPORE AS ALL MEN SHOULD DO
ALWAYS
INDEED I WONDER WHEN I THINK THAT A SENSIBLE PEOPLE LIKE
OURS REALLY MORE ATTACHED TO THEIR CLERGY THAN THEY WERE IN THE LOST
DAYS WHEN THE MATHERS AND NORTONS WERE NOBLEMEN SHOULD CHOOSE TO
NEUTRALIZE SO MUCH OF THEIR MINISTERS' LIVES AND DESTROY SO MUCH OF
THEIR EARLY TRAINING BY THIS UNDEFINED PASSION FOR SEEING THEM IN
PUBLIC
IT SPRINGS FROM OUR BALANCING OF SECTS
IF A SPIRITED
EPISCOPALIAN TAKES AN INTEREST IN THE ALMSHOUSE AND IS PUT ON THE
POOR BOARD EVERY OTHER DENOMINATION MUST HAVE A MINISTER THERE LEST
THE POORHOUSE BE CHANGED INTO ST
PAUL'S CATHEDRAL
IF A SANDEMANIAN
IS CHOSEN PRESIDENT OF THE YOUNG MEN'S LIBRARY THERE MUST BE A
METHODIST VICE PRESIDENT AND A BAPTIST SECRETARY
AND IF A
UNIVERSALIST SUNDAY SCHOOL CONVENTION COLLECTS FIVE HUNDRED DELEGATES
THE NEXT CONGREGATIONALIST SABBATH SCHOOL CONFERENCE MUST BE AS LARGE
LEST 'THEY' WHOEVER THEY MAY BE SHOULD THINK 'WE' WHOEVER WE
MAY BE ARE GOING DOWN
FREED FROM THESE NECESSITIES THAT HAPPY YEAR I BEGAN TO KNOW MY WIFE
BY SIGHT
WE SAW EACH OTHER SOMETIMES
IN THOSE LONG MORNINGS WHEN
DENNIS WAS IN THE STUDY EXPLAINING TO MAP PEDDLERS THAT I HAD ELEVEN
MAPS OF JERUSALEM ALREADY AND TO SCHOOL BOOK AGENTS THAT I WOULD SEE
THEM HANGED BEFORE I WOULD BE BRIBED TO INTRODUCE THEIR TEXTBOOKS INTO
THE SCHOOLS SHE AND I WERE AT WORK TOGETHER AS IN THOSE OLD DREAMY
DAYS AND IN THESE OF OUR LOG CABIN AGAIN
BUT ALL THIS COULD NOT
LAST AND AT LENGTH POOR DENNIS MY DOUBLE OVERTASKED IN TURN UNDID
ME
IT WAS THUS IT HAPPENED
THERE IS AN EXCELLENT FELLOW ONCE A
MINISTER I WILL CALL HIM ISAACS WHO DESERVES WELL OF THE WORLD TILL
HE DIES AND AFTER BECAUSE HE ONCE IN A REAL EXIGENCY DID THE RIGHT
THING IN THE RIGHT WAY AT THE RIGHT TIME AS NO OTHER MAN COULD DO
IT
IN THE WORLD'S GREAT FOOTBALL MATCH THE BALL BY CHANCE FOUND HIM
LOITERING ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD HE CLOSED WITH IT CAMPED IT
CHARGED IT HOME YES RIGHT THROUGH THE OTHER SIDE NOT DISTURBED
NOT FRIGHTENED BY HIS OWN SUCCESS AND BREATHLESS FOUND HIMSELF A
GREAT MAN AS THE GREAT DELTA RANG APPLAUSE
BUT HE DID NOT FIND
HIMSELF A RICH MAN AND THE FOOTBALL HAS NEVER COME IN HIS WAY AGAIN
FROM THAT MOMENT TO THIS MOMENT HE HAS BEEN OF NO USE THAT ONE CAN
SEE AT ALL
STILL FOR THAT GREAT ACT WE SPEAK OF ISAACS GRATEFULLY
AND REMEMBER HIM KINDLY AND HE FORGES ON HOPING TO MEET THE FOOTBALL
SOMEWHERE AGAIN
IN THAT VAGUE HOPE HE HAD ARRANGED A MOVEMENT FOR
A GENERAL ORGANIZATION OF THE HUMAN FAMILY INTO DEBATING CLUBS COUNTY
SOCIETIES STATE UNIONS ETC ETC WITH A VIEW OF INDUCING ALL
CHILDREN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE HANDLES OF THEIR KNIVES AND FORKS
INSTEAD OF THE METAL
CHILDREN HAVE BAD HABITS IN THAT WAY
THE
MOVEMENT OF COURSE WAS ABSURD BUT WE ALL DID OUR BEST TO FORWARD
NOT IT BUT HIM
IT CAME TIME FOR THE ANNUAL COUNTY MEETING ON THIS
SUBJECT TO BE HELD AT NAGUADAVICK
ISAACS CAME ROUND GOOD FELLOW TO
ARRANGE FOR IT GOT THE TOWNHALL GOT THE GOVERNOR TO PRESIDE THE
SAINT HE OUGHT TO HAVE TRIPLET DOUBLES PROVIDED HIM BY LAW AND
THEN CAME TO GET ME TO SPEAK
NO I SAID I WOULD NOT SPEAK IF TEN
GOVERNORS PRESIDED
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE ENTERPRISE
IF I SPOKE IT
SHOULD BE TO SAY CHILDREN SHOULD TAKE HOLD OF THE PRONGS OF THE FORKS
AND THE BLADES OF THE KNIVES
I WOULD SUBSCRIBE TEN DOLLARS BUT I
WOULD NOT SPEAK A MILL SO POOR ISAACS WENT HIS WAY SADLY TO COAX
AUCHMUTY TO SPEAK AND DELAFIELD
I WENT OUT
NOT LONG AFTER HE CAME
BACK AND TOLD POLLY THAT THEY HAD PROMISED TO SPEAK THE GOVERNOR
WOULD SPEAK AND HE HIMSELF WOULD CLOSE WITH THE QUARTERLY REPORT AND
SOME INTERESTING ANECDOTES REGARDING
MISS BIFFIN'S WAY OF HANDLING
HER KNIFE AND MR
NELLIS'S WAY OF FOOTING HIS FORK
NOW IF MR
INGHAM
WILL ONLY COME AND SIT ON THE PLATFORM HE NEED NOT SAY ONE WORD BUT
IT WILL SHOW WELL IN THE PAPER IT WILL SHOW THAT THE SANDEMANIANS
TAKE AS MUCH INTEREST IN THE MOVEMENT AS THE ARMENIANS OR THE
MESOPOTAMIANS AND WILL BE A GREAT FAVOR TO ME POLLY GOOD SOUL WAS
TEMPTED AND SHE PROMISED
SHE KNEW MRS
ISAACS WAS STARVING AND THE
BABIES SHE KNEW DENNIS WAS AT HOME AND SHE PROMISED NIGHT CAME AND
I RETURNED
I HEARD HER STORY
I WAS SORRY
I DOUBTED
BUT POLLY HAD
PROMISED TO BEG ME AND I DARED ALL I TOLD DENNIS TO HOLD HIS PEACE
UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SENT HIM DOWN
IT WAS NOT HALF AN HOUR MORE BEFORE HE RETURNED WILD WITH
EXCITEMENT IN A PERFECT IRISH FURY WHICH IT WAS LONG BEFORE I
UNDERSTOOD
BUT I KNEW AT ONCE THAT HE HAD UNDONE ME
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS THE AUDIENCE GOT TOGETHER ATTRACTED BY
GOVERNOR GORGES'S NAME
THERE WERE A THOUSAND PEOPLE
POOR GORGES WAS
LATE FROM AUGUSTA
THEY BECAME IMPATIENT
HE CAME IN DIRECT FROM THE
TRAIN AT LAST REALLY IGNORANT OF THE OBJECT OF THE MEETING
HE OPENED
IT IN THE FEWEST POSSIBLE WORDS AND SAID OTHER GENTLEMEN WERE PRESENT
WHO WOULD ENTERTAIN THEM BETTER THAN HE
THE AUDIENCE WERE
DISAPPOINTED BUT WAITED
THE GOVERNOR PROMPTED BY ISAACS SAID THE
HONORABLE MR
DELAFIELD WILL ADDRESS YOU DELAFIELD HAD FORGOTTEN THE
KNIVES AND FORKS AND WAS PLAYING THE RUY LOPEZ OPENING AT THE CHESS
CLUB
THE REV
MR
AUCHMUTY WILL ADDRESS YOU AUCHMUTY HAD PROMISED
TO SPEAK LATE AND WAS AT THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE
I SEE DR
STEARNS IN
THE HALL PERHAPS HE WILL SAY A WORD DR
STEARNS SAID HE HAD COME TO
LISTEN AND NOT TO SPEAK
THE GOVERNOR AND ISAACS WHISPERED
THE
GOVERNOR LOOKED AT DENNIS WHO WAS RESPLENDENT ON THE PLATFORM BUT
ISAACS TO GIVE HIM HIS DUE SHOOK HIS HEAD
BUT THE LOOK WAS ENOUGH
A MISERABLE LAD ILL BRED WHO HAD ONCE BEEN IN BOSTON THOUGHT IT
WOULD SOUND WELL TO CALL FOR ME AND PEEPED OUT INGHAM A FEW MORE
WRETCHES CRIED INGHAM INGHAM STILL ISAACS WAS FIRM BUT THE
GOVERNOR ANXIOUS INDEED TO PREVENT A ROW KNEW I WOULD SAY
SOMETHING AND SAID OUR FRIEND MR
INGHAM IS ALWAYS PREPARED AND
THOUGH WE HAD NOT RELIED UPON HIM HE WILL SAY A WORD PERHAPS
APPLAUSE FOLLOWED WHICH TURNED DENNIS'S HEAD
HE ROSE FLATTERED AND
TRIED NO
3 THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH SAID AND ON THE WHOLE SO WELL
SAID THAT I WILL NOT LONGER OCCUPY THE TIME AND SAT DOWN LOOKING
FOR HIS HAT FOR THINGS SEEMED SQUALLY
BUT THE PEOPLE CRIED GO ON
GO ON AND SOME APPLAUDED
DENNIS STILL CONFUSED BUT FLATTERED BY
THE APPLAUSE TO WHICH NEITHER HE NOR I ARE USED ROSE AGAIN AND THIS
TIME TRIED NO
2 I AM VERY GLAD YOU LIKED IT IN A SONOROUS CLEAR
DELIVERY
MY BEST FRIENDS STARED
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT KNOW ME
PERSONALLY YELLED WITH DELIGHT AT THE ASPECT OF THE EVENING THE
GOVERNOR WAS BESIDE HIMSELF AND POOR ISAACS THOUGHT HE WAS UNDONE
ALAS IT WAS I A BOY IN THE GALLERY CRIED IN A LOUD TONE IT'S ALL
AN INFERNAL HUMBUG JUST AS DENNIS WAVING HIS HAND COMMANDED
SILENCE AND TRIED NO
4 I AGREE IN GENERAL WITH MY FRIEND THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THE POOR GOVERNOR DOUBTED HIS SENSES AND
CROSSED TO STOP HIM NOT IN TIME HOWEVER
THE SAME GALLERY BOY
SHOUTED HOW'S YOUR MOTHER AND DENNIS NOW COMPLETELY LOST TRIED
AS HIS LAST SHOT NO
1 VAINLY VERY WELL THANK YOU AND YOU
I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN UNDONE ALREADY
BUT DENNIS LIKE ANOTHER
LOCKHARD CHOSE TO MAKE SICKER THE AUDIENCE ROSE IN A WHIRL OF
AMAZEMENT RAGE AND SORROW
SOME OTHER IMPERTINENCE AIMED AT DENNIS
BROKE ALL RESTRAINT AND IN PURE IRISH HE DELIVERED HIMSELF OF AN
ADDRESS TO THE GALLERY INVITING ANY PERSON WHO WISHED TO FIGHT TO
COME DOWN AND DO SO STATING THAT THEY WERE ALL DOGS AND
COWARDS THAT HE WOULD TAKE ANY FIVE OF THEM SINGLE HANDED SHURE I
HAVE SAID ALL HIS RIVERENCE AND THE MISTHRESS BADE ME SAY CRIED HE
IN DEFIANCE AND SEIZING THE GOVERNOR'S CANE FROM HIS HAND
BRANDISHED IT QUARTER STAFF FASHION ABOVE HIS HEAD
HE WAS INDEED
GOT FROM THE HALL ONLY WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY BY THE GOVERNOR
THE CITY MARSHAL WHO HAD BEEN CALLED IN AND THE SUPERINTENDENT OF MY
SUNDAY SCHOOL
THE UNIVERSAL IMPRESSION OF COURSE WAS THAT THE REV
FREDERIC
INGHAM HAD LOST ALL COMMAND OF HIMSELF IN SOME OF THOSE HAUNTS OF
INTOXICATION WHICH FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN LABORING TO DESTROY
TILL THIS MOMENT INDEED THAT IS THE IMPRESSION IN NAGUADAVICK
THIS
NUMBER OF THE ATLANTIC WILL RELIEVE FROM IT A HUNDRED FRIENDS OF
MINE WHO HAVE BEEN SADLY WOUNDED BY THAT NOTION NOW FOR YEARS BUT I
SHALL NOT BE LIKELY EVER TO SHOW MY HEAD THERE AGAIN
NO MY DOUBLE HAS UNDONE ME
WE LEFT TOWN AT SEVEN THE NEXT MORNING
I CAME TO NO
9 IN THE THIRD
RANGE AND SETTLED ON THE MINISTER'S LOT IN THE NEW TOWNS IN MAINE
THE FIRST SETTLED MINISTER HAS A GIFT OF A HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND
I AM
THE FIRST SETTLED MINISTER IN NO
9
MY WIFE AND LITTLE PAULINA ARE MY
PARISH
WE RAISE CORN ENOUGH TO LIVE ON IN SUMMER
WE KILL BEAR'S MEAT
ENOUGH TO CARBONIZE IT IN WINTER
I WORK ON STEADILY ON MY TRACES OF
SANDEMANIANISM IN THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH CENTURIES WHICH I HOPE TO
PERSUADE PHILLIPS SAMPSON CO
TO PUBLISH NEXT YEAR
WE ARE VERY
HAPPY BUT THE WORLD THINKS WE ARE UNDONE
A VISIT TO THE ASYLUM FOR AGED AND DECAYED PUNSTERS
BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES 1809 1894
FROM THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY JANUARY 1861
REPUBLISHED IN SOUNDINGS
FROM THE ATLANTIC 1864 BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES WHOSE AUTHORIZED
PUBLISHERS ARE THE HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY
HAVING JUST RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO THIS ADMIRABLE INSTITUTION IN
COMPANY WITH A FRIEND WHO IS ONE OF THE DIRECTORS WE PROPOSE GIVING A
SHORT ACCOUNT OF WHAT WE SAW AND HEARD
THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THE
ASYLUM FOR IDIOTS AND FEEBLE MINDED YOUTH SEVERAL OF THE SCHOLARS
FROM WHICH HAVE REACHED CONSIDERABLE DISTINCTION ONE OF THEM BEING
CONNECTED WITH A LEADING DAILY PAPER IN THIS CITY AND OTHERS HAVING
SERVED IN THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEGISLATURES WAS THE MOTIVE WHICH
LED TO THE FOUNDATION OF THIS EXCELLENT CHARITY
OUR LATE
DISTINGUISHED TOWNSMAN NOAH DOW ESQUIRE AS IS WELL KNOWN
BEQUEATHED A LARGE PORTION OF HIS FORTUNE TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT
BEING THERETO MOVED AS HIS WILL EXPRESSED IT BY THE DESIRE OF
N
DOWING SOME PUBLIC INSTITUTION FOR THE BENEFIT OF MANKIND
BEING CONSULTED AS TO THE RULES OF THE INSTITUTION AND THE SELECTION
OF A SUPERINTENDENT HE REPLIED THAT ALL BOARDS MUST CONSTRUCT
THEIR OWN PLATFORMS OF OPERATION
LET THEM SELECT ANYHOW AND HE
SHOULD BE PLEASED N E
HOWE ESQ WAS CHOSEN IN COMPLIANCE WITH
THIS DELICATE SUGGESTION
THE CHARTER PROVIDES FOR THE SUPPORT OF ONE HUNDRED AGED AND DECAYED
GENTLEMEN PUNSTERS ON INQUIRY IF THERE WAY NO PROVISION FOR
FEMALES MY FRIEND CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THIS REMARKABLE
PSYCHOLOGICAL FACT NAMELY
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FEMALE PUNSTER
THIS REMARK STRUCK ME FORCIBLY AND ON REFLECTION I FOUND THAT I
NEVER KNEW NOR HEARD OF ONE THOUGH I HAVE ONCE OR TWICE HEARD A
WOMAN MAKE A SINGLE DETACHED PUN AS I HAVE KNOWN A HEN TO CROW
ON ARRIVING AT THE SOUTH GATE OF THE ASYLUM GROUNDS I WAS ABOUT TO
RING BUT MY FRIEND HELD MY ARM AND BEGGED ME TO RAP WITH MY STICK
WHICH I DID
AN OLD MAN WITH A VERY COMICAL FACE PRESENTLY OPENED THE
GATE AND PUT OUT HIS HEAD
SO YOU PREFER CANE TO A BELL DO YOU HE SAID AND BEGAN
CHUCKLING AND COUGHING AT A GREAT RATE
MY FRIEND WINKED AT ME
YOU'RE HERE STILL OLD JOE I SEE HE SAID TO THE OLD MAN
YES YES AND IT'S VERY ODD CONSIDERING HOW OFTEN I'VE BOLTED
NIGHTS
HE THEN THREW OPEN THE DOUBLE GATES FOR US TO RIDE THROUGH
NOW SAID THE OLD MAN AS HE PULLED THE GATES AFTER US YOU'VE HAD
A LONG JOURNEY
WHY HOW IS THAT OLD JOE SAID MY FRIEND
DON'T YOU SEE HE ANSWERED THERE'S THE EAST HINGES ON THE ONE
SIDE OF THE GATE AND THERE'S THE WEST HINGES ON T'OTHER SIDE HAW
HAW HAW
WE HAD NO SOONER GOT INTO THE YARD THAN A FEEBLE LITTLE GENTLEMAN
WITH A REMARKABLY BRIGHT EYE CAME UP TO US LOOKING VERY SERIOUS AS
IF SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
THE TOWN HAS ENTERED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE ASYLUM AS A GAMBLING
ESTABLISHMENT HE SAID TO MY FRIEND THE DIRECTOR
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID MY FRIEND
WHY THEY COMPLAIN THAT THERE'S A LOT O' RYE ON THE PREMISES HE
ANSWERED POINTING TO A FIELD OF THAT GRAIN AND HOBBLED AWAY HIS
SHOULDERS SHAKING WITH LAUGHTER AS HE WENT
ON ENTERING THE MAIN BUILDING WE SAW THE RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR
THE ASYLUM CONSPICUOUSLY POSTED UP
I MADE A FEW EXTRACTS WHICH MAY BE
INTERESTING

OF INMATES
THE SUBJOINED CONUNDRUM IS NOT ALLOWED WHY IS HASTY PUDDING LIKE THE
PRINCE BECAUSE IT COMES ATTENDED BY ITS SWEET NOR THIS VARIATION
TO IT TO WIT BECAUSE THE 'LASSES RUNS AFTER IT
THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO WENT ROUND WITH US HAD BEEN A NOTED PUNSTER
IN HIS TIME AND WELL KNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD BUT LOST HIS
CUSTOMERS BY MAKING TOO FREE WITH THEIR NAMES AS IN THE FAMOUS STORY
HE SET AFLOAT IN '29 OF FOUR JERRIES ATTACHING TO THE NAMES OF A
NOTED JUDGE AN EMINENT LAWYER THE SECRETARY OF THE BOARD OF FOREIGN
MISSIONS AND THE WELL KNOWN LANDLORD AT SPRINGFIELD
ONE OF THE FOUR
JERRIES HE ADDED WAS OF GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE
THE PLAY ON WORDS WAS
BROUGHT OUT BY AN ACCIDENTAL REMARK OF SOLOMONS THE WELL KNOWN
BANKER
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT THE JEW WAS OVERHEARD SAYING WITH
REFERENCE TO THE GUILTY PARTIES
HE WAS UNDERSTOOD AS SAYING A
CAPITAL PUN IS MEANT WHICH LED TO AN INVESTIGATION AND THE RELIEF OF
THE GREATLY EXCITED PUBLIC MIND
THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD TENDENCIES AS HE WENT ROUND
WITH US
DO YOU KNOW HE BROKE OUT ALL AT ONCE WHY THEY DON'T TAKE STEPPES
IN TARTARY FOR ESTABLISHING INSANE HOSPITALS
WE BOTH CONFESSED IGNORANCE
BECAUSE THERE ARE NOMAD PEOPLE TO BE FOUND THERE HE SAID WITH A
DIGNIFIED SMILE
HE PROCEEDED TO INTRODUCE US TO DIFFERENT INMATES
THE FIRST WAS A
MIDDLE AGED SCHOLARLY MAN WHO WAS SEATED AT A TABLE WITH A
WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY AND A SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE HIM
WELL WHAT LUCK TO DAY MR
MOWZER SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT
THREE OR FOUR ONLY SAID MR
MOWZER
WILL YOU HEAR 'EM NOW NOW I'M
HERE
WE ALL NODDED
DON'T YOU SEE WEBSTER ERS IN THE WORDS CENT ER AND THEAT ER
IF HE SPELLS LEATHER LETHER AND FEATHER FETHER ISN'T THERE
DANGER THAT HE'LL GIVE US A BAD SPELL OF WEATHER
BESIDES WEBSTER IS A RESURRECTIONIST HE DOES NOT ALLOW U TO REST
QUIETLY IN THE MOULD
AND AGAIN BECAUSE MR
WORCESTER INSERTS AN ILLUSTRATION IN HIS TEXT
IS THAT ANY REASON WHY MR
WEBSTER'S PUBLISHERS SHOULD HITCH ONE ON IN
THEIR APPENDIX IT'S WHAT I CALL A CONNECT A CUT TRICK
WHY IS HIS WAY OF SPELLING LIKE THE FLOOR OF AN OVEN BECAUSE IT IS
UNDER BREAD
MOWZER SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT WORD IS ON THE INDEX
I FORGOT SAID MR
MOWZER PLEASE DON'T DEPRIVE ME OF VANITY FAIR
THIS ONE TIME SIR
THESE ARE ALL THIS MORNING
GOOD DAY GENTLEMEN THEN TO THE
SUPERINTENDENT ADD YOU SIR
THE NEXT INMATE WAS A SEMI IDIOTIC LOOKING OLD MAN
HE HAD A HEAP OF
BLOCK LETTERS BEFORE HIM AND AS WE CAME UP HE POINTED WITHOUT
SAYING A WORD TO THE ARRANGEMENTS HE HAD MADE WITH THEM ON THE TABLE
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY ANAGRAMS AND HAD THE MERIT OF TRANSPOSING THE
LETTERS OF THE WORDS EMPLOYED WITHOUT ADDITION OR SUBTRACTION
HERE
ARE A FEW OF THEM

ALLOPATHY
ALL O' TH' PAY
HOMOEOPATHY
O THE O O MY PAH
THE MENTION OF SEVERAL NEW YORK PAPERS LED TO TWO OR THREE QUESTIONS
THUS WHETHER THE EDITOR OF THE TRIBUNE WAS H G
REALLY IF THE
COMPLEXION OF HIS POLITICS WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR BY HIS BEING AN
EAGER PERSON HIMSELF WHETHER WENDELL FILLIPS WERE NOT A REDUCED
COPY OF JOHN KNOCKS WHETHER A NEW YORK FEUILLETONISTE IS NOT THE
SAME THING AS A FELLOW DOWN EAST
AT THIS TIME A PLAUSIBLE LOOKING BALD HEADED MAN JOINED US EVIDENTLY
WAITING TO TAKE A PART IN THE CONVERSATION
GOOD MORNING MR
RIGGLES SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT ANYTHING FRESH
THIS MORNING ANY CONUNDRUM
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE CATTLE HE ANSWERED DRYLY
CATTLE WHY CATTLE
WHY TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CORN UNDER 'EM HE SAID AND
IMMEDIATELY ASKED WHY IS DOUGLAS LIKE THE EARTH
WE TRIED BUT COULDN'T GUESS
BECAUSE HE WAS FLATTENED OUT AT THE POLLS SAID MR
RIGGLES
A FAMOUS POLITICIAN FORMERLY SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT
HIS
GRANDFATHER WAS A SEIZE HESSIAN IST IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR
BY THE
WAY I HEAR THE FREEZE OIL DOCTRINES DON'T GO DOWN AT NEW BEDFORD
THE NEXT INMATE LOOKED AS IF HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SAILOR FORMERLY
ASK HIM WHAT HIS CALLING WAS SAID THE SUPERINTENDENT
FOLLOWED THE SEA HE REPLIED TO THE QUESTION PUT BY ONE OF US
WENT
AS MATE IN A FISHING SCHOONER
WHY DID YOU GIVE IT UP
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE WORKING FOR TWO MAST ERS HE REPLIED
PRESENTLY WE CAME UPON A GROUP OF ELDERLY PERSONS GATHERED ABOUT A
VENERABLE GENTLEMAN WITH FLOWING LOCKS WHO WAS PROPOUNDING QUESTIONS
TO A ROW OF INMATES
CAN ANY INMATE GIVE ME A MOTTO FOR M
BERGER HE SAID
NOBODY RESPONDED FOR TWO OR THREE MINUTES
AT LAST ONE OLD MAN WHOM I
AT ONCE RECOGNIZED AS A GRADUATE OF OUR UNIVERSITY ANNO 1800 HELD UP
HIS HAND
REM A CUE TETIGIT
GO TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS JOSSELYN SAID THE VENERABLE PATRIARCH
THE SUCCESSFUL INMATE DID AS HE WAS TOLD BUT IN A VERY ROUGH WAY
PUSHING AGAINST TWO OR THREE OF THE CLASS
HOW IS THIS SAID THE PATRIARCH
YOU TOLD ME TO GO UP JOSTLIN' HE REPLIED
THE OLD GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN SHOVED ABOUT ENJOYED THE PUN TOO MUCH
TO BE ANGRY
PRESENTLY THE PATRIARCH ASKED AGAIN
WHY WAS M
BERGER AUTHORIZED TO GO TO THE DANCES GIVEN TO THE
PRINCE
THE CLASS HAD TO GIVE UP THIS AND HE ANSWERED IT HIMSELF
BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF HIS CARROMS WAS A TICK IT TO THE BALL
WHO COLLECTS THE MONEY TO DEFRAY THE EXPENSES OF THE LAST CAMPAIGN IN
ITALY ASKED THE PATRIARCH
HERE AGAIN THE CLASS FAILED
THE WAR CLOUD'S ROLLING DUN HE ANSWERED
AND WHAT IS MULLED WINE MADE WITH
THREE OR FOUR VOICES EXCLAIMED AT ONCE
SIZZLE Y MADEIRA
HERE A SERVANT ENTERED AND SAID LUNCHEON TIME THE OLD GENTLEMEN
WHO HAVE EXCELLENT APPETITES DISPERSED AT ONCE ONE OF THEM POLITELY
ASKING US IF WE WOULD NOT STOP AND HAVE A BIT OF BREAD AND A LITTLE
MITE OF CHEESE
THERE IS ONE THING I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO SHOW YOU SAID THE
SUPERINTENDENT THE CELL FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF VIOLENT AND
UNMANAGEABLE PUNSTERS
WE WERE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE IT PARTICULARLY WITH REFERENCE TO THE
ALLEGED ABSENCE OF EVERY OBJECT UPON WHICH A PLAY OF WORDS COULD
POSSIBLY BE MADE
THE SUPERINTENDENT LED US UP SOME DARK STAIRS TO A CORRIDOR THEN
ALONG A NARROW PASSAGE THEN DOWN A BROAD FLIGHT OF STEPS INTO ANOTHER
PASSAGEWAY AND OPENED A LARGE DOOR WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE MAIN
ENTRANCE
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE CELL FOR THE CONFINEMENT OF 'VIOLENT AND
UNMANAGEABLE' PUNSTERS WE BOTH EXCLAIMED
THIS IS THE SELL HE EXCLAIMED POINTING TO THE OUTSIDE PROSPECT
MY FRIEND THE DIRECTOR LOOKED ME IN THE FACE SO GOOD NATUREDLY THAT
I HAD TO LAUGH
WE LIKE TO HUMOR THE INMATES HE SAID
IT HAS A BAD EFFECT WE
FIND ON THEIR HEALTH AND SPIRITS TO DISAPPOINT THEM OF THEIR LITTLE
PLEASANTRIES
SOME OF THE JESTS TO WHICH WE HAVE LISTENED ARE NOT NEW
TO ME THOUGH I DARE SAY YOU MAY NOT HAVE HEARD THEM OFTEN BEFORE
THE
SAME THING HAPPENS IN GENERAL SOCIETY WITH THIS ADDITIONAL
DISADVANTAGE THAT THERE IS NO PUNISHMENT PROVIDED FOR 'VIOLENT AND
UNMANAGEABLE' PUNSTERS AS IN OUR INSTITUTION
WE MADE OUR BOW TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AND WALKED TO THE PLACE WHERE
OUR CARRIAGE WAS WAITING FOR US
ON OUR WAY AN EXCEEDINGLY DECREPIT
OLD MAN MOVED SLOWLY TOWARD US WITH A PERFECTLY BLANK LOOK ON HIS
FACE BUT STILL APPEARING AS IF HE WISHED TO SPEAK
LOOK SAID THE DIRECTOR THAT IS OUR CENTENARIAN
THE ANCIENT MAN CRAWLED TOWARD US COCKED ONE EYE WITH WHICH HE
SEEMED TO SEE A LITTLE UP AT US AND SAID
SARVANT YOUNG GENTLEMEN
WHY IS A A A LIKE A A A GIVE IT UP
BECAUSE IT'S A A A A
HE SMILED A PLEASANT SMILE AS IF IT WERE ALL PLAIN ENOUGH
ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN LAST CHRISTMAS SAID THE DIRECTOR
OF LATE
YEARS HE PUTS HIS WHOLE CONUNDRUMS IN BLANK BUT THEY PLEASE HIM JUST
AS WELL
WE TOOK OUR DEPARTURE MUCH GRATIFIED AND INSTRUCTED BY OUR VISIT
HOPING TO HAVE SOME FUTURE OPPORTUNITY OF INSPECTING THE RECORDS OF
THIS EXCELLENT CHARITY AND MAKING EXTRACTS FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR
READERS
THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY
BY MARK TWAIN 1835 1910
FROM THE SATURDAY PRESS NOV
18 1865
REPUBLISHED IN THE
CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY AND OTHER SKETCHES
1867 BY MARK TWAIN ALL OF WHOSE WORKS ARE PUBLISHED BY HARPER
BROTHERS
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUEST OF A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WROTE ME FROM
THE EAST I CALLED ON GOOD NATURED GARRULOUS OLD SIMON WHEELER AND
INQUIRED AFTER MY FRIEND'S FRIEND LEONIDAS W
SMILEY AS REQUESTED TO
DO AND I HEREUNTO APPEND THE RESULT
I HAVE A LURKING SUSPICION THAT
LEONIDAS W
SMILEY IS A MYTH AND THAT MY FRIEND NEVER KNEW SUCH A
PERSONAGE AND THAT HE ONLY CONJECTURED THAT IF I ASKED OLD WHEELER
ABOUT HIM IT WOULD REMIND HIM OF HIS INFAMOUS JIM SMILEY AND HE
WOULD GO TO WORK AND BORE ME TO DEATH WITH SOME EXASPERATING
REMINISCENCE OF HIM AS LONG AND AS TEDIOUS AS IT SHOULD BE USELESS TO
ME
IF THAT WAS THE DESIGN IT SUCCEEDED
I FOUND SIMON WHEELER DOZING COMFORTABLY BY THE BARROOM STOVE OF THE
DILAPIDATED TAVERN IN THE DECAYED MINING CAMP OF ANGEL'S AND I
NOTICED THAT HE WAS FAT AND BALD HEADED AND HAD AN EXPRESSION OF
WINNING GENTLENESS AND SIMPLICITY UPON HIS TRANQUIL COUNTENANCE
HE
ROUSED UP AND GAVE ME GOOD DAY
I TOLD HIM A FRIEND HAD COMMISSIONED
ME TO MAKE SOME INQUIRIES ABOUT A CHERISHED COMPANION OF HIS BOYHOOD
NAMED LEONIDAS W
SMILEY REV
LEONIDAS W SMILEY A YOUNG
MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL WHO HE HAD HEARD WAS AT ONE TIME A RESIDENT OF
ANGEL'S CAMP
I ADDED THAT IF MR
WHEELER COULD TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS REV
LEONIDAS W
SMILEY I WOULD FEEL UNDER MANY OBLIGATIONS TO
HIM
SIMON WHEELER BACKED ME INTO A CORNER AND BLOCKADED ME THERE WITH HIS
CHAIR AND THEN SAT DOWN AND REELED OFF THE MONOTONOUS NARRATIVE WHICH
FOLLOWS THIS PARAGRAPH
HE NEVER SMILED HE NEVER FROWNED HE NEVER
CHANGED HIS VOICE FROM THE GENTLE FLOWING KEY TO WHICH HE TUNED HIS
INITIAL SENTENCE HE NEVER BETRAYED THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF
ENTHUSIASM BUT ALL THROUGH THE INTERMINABLE NARRATIVE THERE RAN A
VEIN OF IMPRESSIVE EARNESTNESS AND SINCERITY WHICH SHOWED ME PLAINLY
THAT SO FAR FROM HIS IMAGINING THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING RIDICULOUS OR
FUNNY ABOUT HIS STORY HE REGARDED IT AS A REALLY IMPORTANT MATTER
AND ADMIRED ITS TWO HEROES AS MEN OF TRANSCENDENT GENIUS IN FINESSE
I LET HIM GO ON IN HIS OWN WAY AND NEVER INTERRUPTED HIM ONCE
REV
LEONIDAS W
H'M REVEREND LE WELL THERE WAS A FELLER HERE ONCE
BY THE NAME OF JIM SMILEY IN THE WINTER OF '49 OR MAY BE IT WAS
THE SPRING OF '50 I DON'T RECOLLECT EXACTLY SOMEHOW THOUGH WHAT
MAKES ME THINK IT WAS ONE OR THE OTHER IS BECAUSE I REMEMBER THE BIG
FLUME WARN'T FINISHED WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO THE CAMP BUT ANY WAY HE
WAS THE CURIOUSEST MAN ABOUT ALWAYS BETTING ON ANYTHING THAT TURNED UP
YOU EVER SEE IF HE COULD GET ANYBODY TO BET ON THE OTHER SIDE AND IF
HE COULDN'T HE'D CHANGE SIDES
ANY WAY THAT SUITED THE OTHER MAN WOULD
SUIT HIM ANY WAY JUST SO'S HE GOT A BET HE WAS SATISFIED
BUT
STILL HE WAS LUCKY UNCOMMON LUCKY HE MOST ALWAYS COME OUT WINNER
HE
WAS ALWAYS READY AND LAYING FOR A CHANCE THERE COULDN'T BE NO
SOLIT'RY THING MENTIONED BUT THAT FELLER'D OFFER TO BET ON IT AND
TAKE ANY SIDE YOU PLEASE AS I WAS JUST TELLING YOU
IF THERE WAS A
HORSE RACE YOU'D FIND HIM FLUSH OR YOU'D FIND HIM BUSTED AT THE END
OF IT IF THERE WAS A DOG FIGHT HE'D BET ON IT IF THERE WAS A
CAT FIGHT HE'D BET ON IT IF THERE WAS A CHICKEN FIGHT HE'D BET ON
IT WHY IF THERE WAS TWO BIRDS SETTING ON A FENCE HE WOULD BET YOU
WHICH ONE WOULD FLY FIRST OR IF THERE WAS A CAMP MEETING HE WOULD BE
THERE REG'LAR TO BET ON PARSON WALKER WHICH HE JUDGED TO BE THE BEST
EXHORTER ABOUT HERE AND HE WAS TOO AND A GOOD MAN
IF HE EVEN SEE A
STRADDLE BUG START TO GO ANYWHERES HE WOULD BET YOU HOW LONG IT WOULD
TAKE HIM TO GET TO TO WHEREVER HE WAS GOING TO AND IF YOU TOOK HIM
UP HE WOULD FOLLER THAT STRADDLE BUG TO MEXICO BUT WHAT HE WOULD FIND
OUT WHERE HE WAS BOUND FOR AND HOW LONG HE WAS ON THE ROAD
LOTS OF
THE BOYS HERE HAS SEEN THAT SMILEY AND CAN TELL YOU ABOUT HIM
WHY IT
NEVER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM HE'D BET ON ANY THING THE
DANGEST FELLER
PARSON WALKER'S WIFE LAID VERY SICK ONCE FOR A GOOD
WHILE AND IT SEEMED AS IF THEY WARN'T GOING TO SAVE HER BUT ONE
MORNING HE COME IN AND SMILEY UP AND ASKED HIM HOW SHE WAS AND HE
SAID SHE WAS CONSIDERABLE BETTER THANK THE LORD FOR HIS INF'NIT'
MERCY AND COMING ON SO SMART THAT WITH THE BLESSING OF PROV'DENCE
SHE'D GET WELL YET AND SMILEY BEFORE HE THOUGHT SAYS WELL I'LL
RISK TWO AND A HALF SHE DON'T ANYWAY
THISH YER SMILEY HAD A MARE THE BOYS CALLED HER THE FIFTEEN MINUTE
NAG BUT THAT WAS ONLY IN FUN YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE WAS
FASTER THAN THAT AND HE USED TO WIN MONEY ON THAT HORSE FOR ALL SHE
WAS SO SLOW AND ALWAYS HAD THE ASTHMA OR THE DISTEMPER OR THE
CONSUMPTION OR SOMETHING OF THAT KIND
THEY USED TO GIVE HER TWO OR
THREE HUNDRED YARDS START AND THEN PASS HER UNDER WAY BUT ALWAYS AT
THE FAG END OF THE RACE SHE'D GET EXCITED AND DESPERATE LIKE AND COME
CAVORTING AND STRADDLING UP AND SCATTERING HER LEGS AROUND LIMBER
SOMETIMES IN THE AIR AND SOMETIMES OUT TO ONE SIDE AMONGST THE
FENCES AND KICKING UP M O R E DUST AND RAISING M O R E RACKET WITH
HER COUGHING AND SNEEZING AND BLOWING HER NOSE AND ALWAYS FETCH UP AT
THE STAND JUST ABOUT A NECK AHEAD AS NEAR AS YOU COULD CIPHER IT
DOWN
AND HE HAD A LITTLE SMALL BULL PUP THAT TO LOOK AT HIM YOU'D THINK HE
WARN'T WORTH A CENT BUT TO SET AROUND AND LOOK ORNERY AND LAY FOR A
CHANCE TO STEAL SOMETHING
BUT AS SOON AS MONEY WAS UP ON HIM HE WAS A
DIFFERENT DOG HIS UNDER JAW'D BEGIN TO STICK OUT LIKE THE FO' CASTLE
OF A STEAMBOAT AND HIS TEETH WOULD UNCOVER AND SHINE LIKE THE
FURNACES
AND A DOG MIGHT TACKLE HIM AND BULLY RAG HIM AND BITE HIM
AND THROW HIM OVER HIS SHOULDER TWO OR THREE TIMES AND ANDREW
JACKSON WHICH WAS THE NAME OF THE PUP ANDREW JACKSON WOULD NEVER LET
ON BUT WHAT HE WAS SATISFIED AND HADN'T EXPECTED NOTHING ELSE AND
THE BETS BEING DOUBLED AND DOUBLED ON THE OTHER SIDE ALL THE TIME
TILL THE MONEY WAS ALL UP AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WOULD GRAB THAT
OTHER DOG JEST BY THE J'INT OF HIS HIND LEG AND FREEZE TO IT NOT
CHAW YOU UNDERSTAND BUT ONLY JUST GRIP AND HANG ON TILL THEY THROWED
UP THE SPONGE IF IT WAS A YEAR
SMILEY ALWAYS COME OUT WINNER ON THAT
PUP TILL HE HARNESSED A DOG ONCE THAT DIDN'T HAVE NO HIND LEGS
BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN SAWED OFF IN A CIRCULAR SAW AND WHEN THE THING
HAD GONE ALONG FAR ENOUGH AND THE MONEY WAS ALL UP AND HE COME TO
MAKE A SNATCH FOR HIS PET HOLT HE SEE IN A MINUTE HOW HE'D BEEN
IMPOSED ON AND HOW THE OTHER DOG HAD HIM IN THE DOOR SO TO SPEAK
AND HE 'PEARED SURPRISED AND THEN HE LOOKED SORTER DISCOURAGED LIKE
AND DIDN'T TRY NO MORE TO WIN THE FIGHT AND SO HE GOT SHUCKED OUT
BAD
HE GAVE SMILEY A LOOK AS MUCH AS TO SAY HIS HEART WAS BROKE AND
IT WAS HIS FAULT FOR PUTTING UP A DOG THAT HADN'T NO HIND LEGS FOR
HIM TO TAKE HOLT OF WHICH WAS HIS MAIN DEPENDENCE IN A FIGHT AND
THEN HE LIMPED OFF A PIECE AND LAID DOWN AND DIED
IT WAS A GOOD PUP
WAS THAT ANDREW JACKSON AND WOULD HAVE MADE A NAME FOR HISSELF IF
HE'D LIVED FOR THE STUFF WAS IN HIM AND HE HAD GENIUS I KNOW IT
BECAUSE HE HADN'T NO OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAK OF AND IT DON'T STAND TO
REASON THAT A DOG COULD MAKE SUCH A FIGHT AS HE COULD UNDER THEM
CIRCUMSTANCES IF HE HADN'T NO TALENT
IT ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL SORRY
WHEN I THINK OF THAT LAST FIGHT OF HIS'N AND THE WAY IT TURNED OUT
WELL THISH YER SMILEY HAD RAT TARRIERS AND CHICKEN COCKS AND
TOM CATS AND ALL OF THEM KIND OF THINGS TILL YOU COULDN'T REST AND
YOU COULDN'T FETCH NOTHING FOR HIM TO BET ON BUT HE'D MATCH YOU
HE
KETCHED A FROG ONE DAY AND TOOK HIM HOME AND SAID HE CAL'LATED TO
EDUCATE HIM AND SO HE NEVER DONE NOTHING FOR THREE MONTHS BUT SET IN
HIS BACK YARD AND LEARN THAT FROG TO JUMP
AND YOU BET YOU HE DID
LEARN HIM TOO
HE'D GIVE HIM A LITTLE PUNCH BEHIND AND THE NEXT
MINUTE YOU'D SEE THAT FROG WHIRLING IN THE AIR LIKE A DOUGHNUT SEE
HIM TURN ONE SUMMERSET OR MAY BE A COUPLE IF HE GOT A GOOD START
AND COME DOWN FLAT FOOTED AND ALL RIGHT LIKE A CAT
HE GOT HIM UP SO
IN THE MATTER OF KETCHING FLIES AND KEP' HIM IN PRACTICE SO CONSTANT
THAT HE'D NAIL A FLY EVERY TIME AS FUR AS HE COULD SEE HIM
SMILEY
SAID ALL A FROG WANTED WAS EDUCATION AND HE COULD DO 'MOST
ANYTHING AND I BELIEVE HIM
WHY I'VE SEEN HIM SET DAN'L WEBSTER DOWN
HERE ON THIS FLOOR DAN'L WEBSTER WAS THE NAME OF THE FROG AND SING
OUT FLIES DAN'L FLIES AND QUICKER'N YOU COULD WINK HE'D SPRING
STRAIGHT UP AND SNAKE A FLY OFF'N THE COUNTER THERE AND FLOP DOWN ON
THE FLOOR AG'IN AS SOLID AS A GOB OF MUD AND FALL TO SCRATCHING THE
SIDE OF HIS HEAD WITH HIS HIND FOOT AS INDIFFERENT AS IF HE HADN'T NO
IDEA HE'D BEEN DOIN' ANY MORE'N ANY FROG MIGHT DO
YOU NEVER SEE A
FROG SO MODEST AND STRAIGHTFOR'ARD AS HE WAS FOR ALL HE WAS SO
GIFTED
AND WHEN IT COME TO FAIR AND SQUARE JUMPING ON A DEAD LEVEL
HE COULD GET OVER MORE GROUND AT ONE STRADDLE THAN ANY ANIMAL OF HIS
BREED YOU EVER SEE
JUMPING ON A DEAD LEVEL WAS HIS STRONG SUIT YOU
UNDERSTAND AND WHEN IT COME TO THAT SMILEY WOULD ANTE UP MONEY ON
HIM AS LONG AS HE HAD A RED
SMILEY WAS MONSTROUS PROUD OF HIS FROG
AND WELL HE MIGHT BE FOR FELLERS THAT HAD TRAVELED AND BEEN
EVERYWHERES ALL SAID HE LAID OVER ANY FROG THAT EVER THEY SEE
WELL SMILEY KEP' THE BEAST IN A LITTLE LATTICE BOX AND HE USED TO
FETCH HIM DOWNTOWN SOMETIMES AND LAY FOR A BET
ONE DAY A FELLER A
STRANGER IN THE CAMP HE WAS COME ACROST HIM WITH HIS BOX AND SAYS
WHAT MIGHT BE THAT YOU'VE GOT IN THE BOX
AND SMILEY SAYS SORTER INDIFFERENT LIKE IT MIGHT BE A PARROT OR IT
MIGHT BE A CANARY MAYBE BUT IT AIN'T IT'S ONLY JUST A FROG
AND THE FELLER TOOK IT AND LOOKED AT IT CAREFUL AND TURNED IT ROUND
THIS WAY AND THAT AND SAYS H'M SO 'TIS
WELL WHAT'S HE GOOD
FOR
WELL SMILEY SAYS EASY AND CARELESS HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ONE
THING I SHOULD JUDGE HE CAN OUTJUMP ANY FROG IN CALAVERAS COUNTY
THE FELLER TOOK THE BOX AGAIN AND TOOK ANOTHER LONG PARTICULAR LOOK
AND GIVE IT BACK TO SMILEY AND SAYS VERY DELIBERATE WELL HE
SAYS I DON'T SEE NO P'INTS ABOUT THAT FROG THAT'S ANY BETTER'N ANY
OTHER FROG
MAYBE YOU DON'T SMILEY SAYS
MAYBE YOU UNDERSTAND FROGS AND MAYBE
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND 'EM MAYBE YOU'VE HAD EXPERIENCE AND MAYBE YOU
AIN'T ONLY A AMATURE AS IT WERE
ANYWAYS I'VE GOT MY OPINION AND
I'LL RISK FORTY DOLLARS THAT HE CAN OUTJUMP ANY FROG IN CALAVERAS
COUNTY
AND THE FELLER STUDIED A MINUTE AND THEN SAYS KINDER SAD LIKE
WELL I'M ONLY A STRANGER HERE AND I AIN'T GOT NO FROG BUT IF I HAD
A FROG I'D BET YOU
AND THEN SMILEY SAYS THAT'S ALL RIGHT THAT'S ALL RIGHT IF YOU'LL
HOLD MY BOX A MINUTE I'LL GO AND GET YOU A FROG AND SO THE FELLER
TOOK THE BOX AND PUT UP HIS FORTY DOLLARS ALONG WITH SMILEY'S AND
SET DOWN TO WAIT
SO HE SET THERE A GOOD WHILE THINKING AND THINKING TO HIS SELF AND
THEN HE GOT THE FROG OUT AND PRIZED HIS MOUTH OPEN AND TOOK A TEASPOON
AND FILLED HIM FULL OF QUAIL SHOT FILLED HIM PRETTY NEAR UP TO HIS
CHIN AND SET HIM ON THE FLOOR
SMILEY HE WENT TO THE SWAMP AND
SLOPPED AROUND IN THE MUD FOR A LONG TIME AND FINALLY HE KETCHED A
FROG AND FETCHED HIM IN AND GIVE HIM TO THIS FELLER AND SAYS
NOW IF YOU'RE READY SET HIM ALONGSIDE OF DAN'L WITH HIS FOREPAWS
JUST EVEN WITH DAN'L'S AND I'LL GIVE THE WORD THEN HE SAYS
ONE TWO THREE GIT AND HIM AND THE FELLER TOUCHED UP THE FROGS
FROM BEHIND AND THE NEW FROG HOPPED OFF LIVELY BUT DAN'L GIVE A
HEAVE AND HYSTED UP HIS SHOULDERS SO LIKE A FRENCHMAN BUT IT
WARN'T NO USE HE COULDN'T BUDGE HE WAS PLANTED AS SOLID AS A CHURCH
AND HE COULDN'T NO MORE STIR THAN IF HE WAS ANCHORED OUT
SMILEY WAS A
GOOD DEAL SURPRISED AND HE WAS DISGUSTED TOO BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE NO
IDEA WHAT THE MATTER WAS OF COURSE
THE FELLER TOOK THE MONEY AND STARTED AWAY AND WHEN HE WAS GOING OUT
AT THE DOOR HE SORTER JERKED HIS THUMB OVER HIS SHOULDER SO AT
DAN'L AND SAYS AGAIN VERY DELIBERATE WELL HE SAYS I DON'T
SEE NO P'INTS ABOUT THAT FROG THAT'S ANY BETTER'N ANY OTHER FROG
SMILEY HE STOOD SCRATCHING HIS HEAD AND LOOKING DOWN AT DAN'L A LONG
TIME AND AT LAST SAYS I DO WONDER WHAT IN THE NATION THAT FROG
THROWED OFF FOR I WONDER IF THERE AIN'T SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH
HIM HE 'PEARS TO LOOK MIGHTY BAGGY SOMEHOW AND HE KETCHED DAN'L UP
BY THE NAP OF THE NECK AND HEFTED HIM AND SAYS WHY BLAME MY CATS
IF HE DON'T WEIGH FIVE POUNDS AND TURNED HIM UPSIDE DOWN AND HE
BELCHED OUT A DOUBLE HANDFUL OF SHOT
AND THEN HE SEE HOW IT WAS AND
HE WAS THE MADDEST MAN HE SET THE FROG DOWN AND TOOK OUT AFTER THAT
FELLER BUT HE NEVER KETCHED HIM
AND
HERE SIMON WHEELER HEARD HIS NAME CALLED FROM THE FRONT YARD AND GOT
UP TO SEE WHAT WAS WANTED AND TURNING TO ME AS HE MOVED AWAY HE
SAID JUST SET WHERE YOU ARE STRANGER AND REST EASY I AIN'T GOING
TO BE GONE A SECOND
BUT BY YOUR LEAVE I DID NOT THINK THAT A CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY
OF THE ENTERPRISING VAGABOND JIM SMILEY WOULD BE LIKELY TO AFFORD ME
MUCH INFORMATION CONCERNING THE REV
LEONIDAS W SMILEY AND SO I
STARTED AWAY
AT THE DOOR I MET THE SOCIABLE WHEELER RETURNING AND HE BUTTONHOLED
ME AND RECOMMENCED
WELL THISH YER SMILEY HAD A YALLER ONE EYED COW THAT DIDN'T HAVE NO
TAIL ONLY JEST A SHORT STUMP LIKE A BANNANNER AND
HOWEVER LACKING BOTH TIME AND INCLINATION I DID NOT WAIT TO HEAR
ABOUT THE AFFLICTED COW BUT TOOK MY LEAVE
ELDER BROWN'S BACKSLIDE
BY HARRY STILLWELL EDWARDS 1855
FROM HARPER'S MAGAZINE AUGUST 1885 COPYRIGHT 1885 BY HARPER
BROS REPUBLISHED IN THE VOLUME TWO RUNAWAYS AND OTHER STORIES
1889 BY HARRY STILLWELL EDWARDS THE CENTURY CO
ELDER BROWN TOLD HIS WIFE GOOD BY AT THE FARMHOUSE DOOR AS
MECHANICALLY AS THOUGH HIS PROPOSED TRIP TO MACON TEN MILES AWAY WAS
AN EVERYDAY AFFAIR WHILE AS A MATTER OF FACT MANY YEARS HAD ELAPSED
SINCE UNACCOMPANIED HE SET FOOT IN THE CITY
HE DID NOT KISS HER
MANY
VERY GOOD MEN NEVER KISS THEIR WIVES
BUT SMALL BLAME ATTACHES TO THE
ELDER FOR HIS OMISSION ON THIS OCCASION SINCE HIS WIFE HAD LONG AGO
DISCOURAGED ALL AMOROUS DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE PART OF HER LIEGE LORD
AND AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT WAS FILLING THE PARTING MOMENTS WITH A
RATTLING LIST OF DIRECTIONS CONCERNING THREAD BUTTONS HOOKS
NEEDLES AND ALL THE MANY ETCETERAS OF AN INDUSTRIOUS HOUSEWIFE'S
BASKET
THE ELDER WAS LABORIOUSLY ASSORTING THESE POSTSCRIPT
COMMISSIONS IN HIS MEMORY WELL KNOWING THAT TO RETURN WITH ANY ONE OF
THEM NEGLECTED WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE
ELDER BROWN MOUNTED HIS PATIENT STEED THAT STOOD SLEEPILY MOTIONLESS
IN THE WARM SUNLIGHT WITH HIS GREAT POINTED EARS DISPLAYED TO THE
RIGHT AND LEFT AS THOUGH THEIR OWNER HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE LIFE
BURDEN THEIR WEIGHT INFLICTED UPON HIM AND WAS OLD SOLDIER FASHION
READY TO FOREGO THE ONCE RIGID ALERTNESS OF EARLY TRAINING FOR THE
PLEASURES OF FREQUENT REST ON ARMS
AND ELDER DON'T YOU FORGIT THEM CALIKER SCRAPS OR YOU'LL BE
WANTIN' KIVER SOON AN' NO KIVER WILL BE A COMIN'
ELDER BROWN DID NOT TURN HIS HEAD BUT MERELY LET THE WHIP HAND WHICH
HAD BEEN CHECKED IN ITS BACKWARD MOTION FALL AS HE ANSWERED
MECHANICALLY
THE BEAST HE BESTRODE RESPONDED WITH A RAPID WHISKING OF
ITS TAIL AND A GREAT SHOW OF EFFORT AS IT AMBLED OFF DOWN THE SANDY
ROAD THE RIDER'S LONG LEGS SEEMING NOW AND THEN TO TOUCH THE GROUND
BUT AS THE ZIGZAG PANELS OF THE RAIL FENCE CREPT BEHIND HIM AND HE
FELT THE FREEDOM OF THE MORNING BEGINNING TO ACT UPON HIS WELL TRAINED
BLOOD THE MECHANICAL MANNER OF THE OLD MAN'S MIND GAVE PLACE TO A
MILD EXUBERANCE
A WEIGHT SEEMED TO BE LIFTING FROM IT OUNCE BY OUNCE
AS THE FENCE PANELS THE WEEDY CORNERS THE PERSIMMON SPROUTS AND
SASSAFRAS BUSHES CREPT AWAY BEHIND HIM SO THAT BY THE TIME A MILE LAY
BETWEEN HIM AND THE LIFE PARTNER OF HIS JOYS AND SORROWS HE WAS IN A
REASONABLY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND AND STILL IMPROVING
IT WAS A QUEER FIGURE THAT CREPT ALONG THE ROAD THAT CHEERY MAY
MORNING
IT WAS TALL AND GAUNT AND HAD BEEN FOR THIRTY YEARS OR MORE
THE LONG HEAD BALD ON TOP COVERED BEHIND WITH IRON GRAY HAIR AND IN
FRONT WITH A SHORT TANGLED GROWTH THAT CURLED AND KINKED IN EVERY
DIRECTION WAS SURMOUNTED BY AN OLD FASHIONED STOVE PIPE HAT WORN AND
STAINED BUT EMINENTLY IMPRESSIVE
AN OLD FASHIONED HENRY CLAY CLOTH
COAT STAINED AND THREADBARE DIVIDED ITSELF IMPARTIALLY OVER THE
DONKEY'S BACK AND DANGLED ON HIS SIDES
THIS WAS ALL THAT REMAINED OF
THE ELDER'S WEDDING SUIT OF FORTY YEARS AGO
ONLY CONSTANT CARE AND
USE OF LATE YEARS LIMITED TO EXTRA OCCASIONS HAD PRESERVED IT SO
LONG
THE TROUSERS HAD SOON PARTED COMPANY WITH THEIR FRIENDS
THE
SUBSTITUTES WERE RED JEANS WHICH WHILE THEY DID NOT WELL MATCH HIS
COURT COSTUME WERE BETTER ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE OLD MAN'S ABUSE FOR
IF IN ADDITION TO HIS FREQUENT RELIGIOUS EXCURSIONS ASTRIDE HIS
BEAST THERE EVER WAS A MAN WHO WAS FOND OF SITTING DOWN WITH HIS FEET
HIGHER THAN HIS HEAD IT WAS THIS SELFSAME ELDER BROWN
THE MORNING EXPANDED AND THE OLD MAN EXPANDED WITH IT FOR WHILE A
VIGOROUS LEADER IN HIS CHURCH THE ELDER AT HOME WAS IT MUST BE
ADMITTED AN UNCOMPLAINING SLAVE
TO THE INTENSE ASTONISHMENT OF THE
BEAST HE RODE THERE CAME NEW VIGOR INTO THE WHACKS WHICH FELL UPON
HIS FLANKS AND THE BEAST ALLOWED ASTONISHMENT TO SURPRISE HIM INTO
REAL LIFE AND DECIDED MOTION
SOMEWHERE IN THE ELDER'S EXPANDING SOUL
A TUNE HAD BEGUN TO RING
POSSIBLY HE TOOK UP THE FAR FAINT TUNE THAT
CAME FROM THE STRAGGLING GANG OF NEGROES AWAY OFF IN THE FIELD AS
THEY SLOWLY CHOPPED AMID THE THREADLIKE ROWS OF COTTON PLANTS WHICH
LINED THE LEVEL GROUND FOR THE MELODY HE HUMMED SOFTLY AND THEN SANG
STRONGLY IN THE QUAVERING CATCHY TONES OF A GOOD OLD COUNTRY
CHURCHMAN WAS I'M GLAD SALVATION'S FREE
IT WAS DURING THE SINGING OF THIS HYMN THAT ELDER BROWN'S REGULAR
MOTION INSPIRING STROKES WERE FOR THE FIRST TIME VARIED
HE BEGAN TO
HOLD HIS HICKORY UP AT CERTAIN PAUSES IN THE MELODY AND BEAT THE
CHANGES UPON THE SIDES OF HIS ASTONISHED STEED
THE CHORUS UNDER THIS
ARRANGEMENT WAS
I'M GLAD SALVATION'S FREE
I'M GLAD SALVATION'S FREE
I'M GLAD SALVATION'S FREE FOR ALL
I'M GLAD SALVATION'S FREE
WHEREVER THERE IS AN ITALIC THE HICKORY DESCENDED
IT FELL ABOUT AS
REGULARLY AND AFTER THE FASHION OF THE STICK BEATING UPON THE BASS
DRUM DURING A FUNERAL MARCH
BUT THE BEAST ALTHOUGH CONVINCED THAT
SOMETHING SERIOUS WAS IMPENDING DID NOT CONSIDER A FUNERAL MARCH
APPROPRIATE FOR THE OCCASION
HE PROTESTED AT FIRST WITH VIGOROUS
WHISKINGS OF HIS TAIL AND A RAPID SHIFTING OF HIS EARS
FINDING THESE
DEMONSTRATIONS UNAVAILING AND CONVINCED THAT SOME URGENT CAUSE FOR
HURRY HAD SUDDENLY INVADED THE ELDER'S SERENITY AS IT HAD HIS OWN HE
BEGAN TO COVER THE GROUND WITH FRANTIC LEAPS THAT WOULD HAVE SURPRISED
HIS OWNER COULD HE HAVE REALIZED WHAT WAS GOING ON
BUT ELDER BROWN'S
EYES WERE HALF CLOSED AND HE WAS SINGING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE
LOST IN A TRANCE OF DIVINE EXALTATION FOR HE FELT THE EFFECTS OF THE
INVIGORATING MOTION BENT ONLY ON MAKING THE AIR RING WITH THE LINES
WHICH HE DIMLY IMAGINED WERE DRAWING UPON HIM THE EYES OF THE WHOLE
FEMALE CONGREGATION HE WAS SUPREMELY UNCONSCIOUS THAT HIS BEAST WAS
HURRYING
AND THUS THE EXCURSION PROCEEDED UNTIL SUDDENLY A SHOTE SURPRISED IN
HIS CALM SEARCH FOR ROOTS IN A FENCE CORNER DARTED INTO THE ROAD AND
STOOD FOR AN INSTANT GAZING UPON THE NEWCOMERS WITH THAT IDIOTIC STARE
WHICH ONLY A PIG CAN IMITATE
THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THIS
UNLOOKED FOR APPARITION ACTED STRONGLY UPON THE DONKEY
WITH ONE
SUPREME EFFORT HE COLLECTED HIMSELF INTO A MOTIONLESS MASS OF MATTER
BRACING HIS FRONT LEGS WIDE APART THAT IS TO SAY HE STOPPED SHORT
THERE HE STOOD RETURNING THE PIG'S IDIOTIC STARE WITH AN INTEREST
WHICH MUST HAVE LED TO THE PRESUMPTION THAT NEVER BEFORE IN ALL HIS
VARIED LIFE HAD HE SEEN SUCH A SINGULAR LITTLE CREATURE
END OVER END
WENT THE MAN OF PRAYER FINALLY BRINGING UP FULL LENGTH IN THE SAND
STRIKING JUST AS HE SHOULD HAVE SHOUTED FREE FOR THE FOURTH TIME IN
HIS GLORIOUS CHORUS
FULLY CONVINCED THAT HIS ALARM HAD BEEN WELL FOUNDED THE SHOTE SPED
OUT FROM UNDER THE GIGANTIC MISSILE HURLED AT HIM BY THE DONKEY AND
SCAMPERED DOWN THE ROAD TURNING FIRST ONE EAR AND THEN THE OTHER TO
DETECT ANY SOUNDS OF PURSUIT
THE DONKEY ALSO CONVINCED THAT THE
OBJECT BEFORE WHICH HE HAD HALTED WAS SUPERNATURAL STARTED BACK
VIOLENTLY UPON SEEING IT APPARENTLY TURN TO A MAN
BUT SEEING THAT IT
HAD TURNED TO NOTHING BUT A MAN HE WANDERED UP INTO THE DESERTED
FENCE CORNER AND BEGAN TO NIBBLE REFRESHMENT FROM A SCRUB OAK
FOR A MOMENT THE ELDER GAZED UP INTO THE SKY HALF IMPRESSED WITH THE
IDEA THAT THE CAMP MEETING PLATFORM HAD GIVEN WAY
BUT THE TRUTH
FORCED ITS WAY TO THE FRONT IN HIS DISORDERED UNDERSTANDING AT LAST
AND WITH PAINFUL DIGNITY HE STAGGERED INTO AN UPRIGHT POSITION AND
REGAINED HIS BEAVER
HE WAS SHOCKED AGAIN
NEVER BEFORE IN ALL THE
LONG YEARS IT HAD SERVED HIM HAD HE SEEN IT IN SUCH SHAPE
THE TRUTH
IS ELDER BROWN HAD NEVER BEFORE TRIED TO STAND ON HIS HEAD IN IT
AS
CALMLY AS POSSIBLE HE BEGAN TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT CARING BUT LITTLE
FOR THE DUST UPON HIS GARMENTS
THE BEAVER WAS HIS SPECIAL CROWN OF
DIGNITY
TO LOSE IT WAS TO BE REDUCED TO A LEVEL WITH THE COMMON
WOOLHAT HERD
HE DID HIS BEST PULLING PRESSING AND PUSHING BUT THE
HAT DID NOT LOOK NATURAL WHEN HE HAD FINISHED
IT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
LAID OFF INTO COUNTIES SECTIONS AND TOWN LOTS
LIKE A WELL CUT
JEWEL IT HAD A FACE FOR HIM VIEW IT FROM WHATEVER POINT HE CHOSE A
QUALITY WHICH SO IMPRESSED HIM THAT A LUMP GATHERED IN HIS THROAT AND
HIS EYES WINKED VIGOROUSLY
ELDER BROWN WAS NOT HOWEVER A MAN FOR TEARS
HE WAS A MAN OF ACTION
THE SUDDEN VISION WHICH MET HIS WANDERING GAZE THE DONKEY CALMLY
CHEWING SCRUB BUDS WITH THE GREEN JUICE ALREADY OOZING FROM THE
CORNERS OF HIS FROTHY MOUTH ACTED UPON HIM LIKE MAGIC
HE WAS AFTER
ALL ONLY HUMAN AND WHEN HE GOT HANDS UPON A PIECE OF BRUSH HE
THRASHED THE POOR BEAST UNTIL IT SEEMED AS THOUGH EVEN ITS ALREADY
HALF TANNED HIDE WOULD BE ETERNALLY RUINED
THOROUGHLY EXHAUSTED AT
LAST HE WEARILY STRADDLED HIS SADDLE AND WITH HIS CHIN UPON HIS
BREAST RESUMED THE EARLY MORNING TENOR OF HIS WAY
II
GOOD MORNIN' SIR
ELDER BROWN LEANED OVER THE LITTLE PINE PICKET WHICH DIVIDED THE
BOOKKEEPERS' DEPARTMENT OF A MACON WAREHOUSE FROM THE ROOM IN GENERAL
AND SURVEYED THE WELL DRESSED BACK OF A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS BUSILY
FIGURING AT A DESK WITHIN
THE APARTMENT WAS CARPETLESS AND THE DUST
OF A DECADE LAY DEEP ON THE OLD BOOKS SHELVES AND THE FAMILIAR
ADVERTISEMENTS OF GUANO AND FERTILIZERS WHICH DECORATED THE ROOM
AN
OLD STOVE RUSTY WITH THE NICOTINE CONTRIBUTED BY FARMERS DURING THE
PREVIOUS SEASON WHILE WAITING BY ITS GLOWING SIDES FOR THEIR COTTON TO
BE SOLD STOOD STRAIGHT UP IN A BED OF SAND AND FESTOONS OF COBWEBS
CLUNG TO THE UPPER SASHES OF THE MURKY WINDOWS
THE LOWER SASH OF ONE
WINDOW HAD BEEN RAISED AND IN THE YARD WITHOUT NEARLY AN ACRE IN
EXTENT LAY A FEW BALES OF COTTON WITH JAGGED HOLES IN THEIR ENDS
JUST AS THE SAMPLER HAD LEFT THEM
ELDER BROWN HAD TIME TO NOTICE ALL
THESE FAMILIAR POINTS FOR THE FIGURE AT THE DESK KEPT SERENELY AT ITS
TASK AND DEIGNED NO REPLY
GOOD MORNIN' SIR SAID ELDER BROWN AGAIN IN HIS MOST DIGNIFIED
TONES
IS MR
THOMAS IN
GOOD MORNING SIR SAID THE FIGURE
I'LL WAIT ON YOU IN A MINUTE
THE MINUTE PASSED AND FOUR MORE JOINED IT
THEN THE DESK MAN TURNED
WELL SIR WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU
THE ELDER WAS NOT IN THE BEST OF HUMOR WHEN HE ARRIVED AND HIS STATE
OF MIND HAD NOT IMPROVED
HE WAITED FULL A MINUTE AS HE SURVEYED THE
MAN OF BUSINESS
I THOUGHT I MOUT BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME ARRANGEMENTS WITH YOU TO GIT
SOME MONEY BUT I RECKON I WAS MISTAKEN THE WAREHOUSE MAN CAME
NEARER
THIS IS MR
BROWN I BELIEVE
I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU AT ONCE
YOU
ARE NOT IN OFTEN TO SEE US
NO MY WIFE USUALLY 'TENDS TO THE TOWN BIZNESS WHILE I RUN THE
CHURCH AND FARM
GOT A FALL FROM MY DONKEY THIS MORNING HE SAID
NOTICING A QUIZZICAL INTERROGATING LOOK UPON THE FACE BEFORE HIM
AND FELL SQUAR' ON THE HAT HE MADE A PRETENSE OF SMOOTHING IT
THE
MAN OF BUSINESS HAD ALREADY LOST INTEREST
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL YOU WANT MR
BROWN
WELL ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SAID THE ELDER REPLACING HIS
HAT AND TURNING A FURTIVE LOOK UPON THE WAREHOUSE MAN
THE OTHER WAS
TAPPING WITH HIS PENCIL UPON THE LITTLE SHELF LYING ACROSS THE RAIL
I CAN GET YOU FIVE HUNDRED
BUT I OUGHTER HAVE SEVEN
CAN'T ARRANGE FOR THAT AMOUNT
WAIT TILL LATER IN THE SEASON AND
COME AGAIN
MONEY IS VERY TIGHT NOW
HOW MUCH COTTON WILL YOU RAISE
WELL I COUNT ON A HUNDR'D BALES
AN' YOU CAN'T GIT THE SEV'N HUNDR'D
DOLLARS
LIKE TO OBLIGE YOU BUT CAN'T RIGHT NOW WILL FIX IT FOR YOU LATER
ON
WELL SAID THE ELDER SLOWLY FIX UP THE PAPERS FOR FIVE AN' I'LL
MAKE IT GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
THE PAPERS WERE DRAWN
A NOTE WAS MADE OUT FOR 552 50 FOR THE
INTEREST WAS AT ONE AND A HALF PER CENT
FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND A
MORTGAGE ON TEN MULES BELONGING TO THE ELDER WAS DRAWN AND SIGNED
THE
ELDER THEN PROMISED TO SEND HIS COTTON TO THE WAREHOUSE TO BE SOLD IN
THE FALL AND WITH A CURT ANYTHING ELSE AND A THANKEE THAT'S
ALL THE TWO PARTED
ELDER BROWN NOW MADE AN EFFORT TO RECALL THE SUPPLEMENTAL COMMISSIONS
SHOUTED TO HIM UPON HIS DEPARTURE INTENDING TO EXECUTE THEM FIRST
AND THEN TAKE HIS WRITTEN LIST ITEM BY ITEM
HIS MENTAL RESOLVES HAD
JUST REACHED THIS POINT WHEN A NEW THOUGHT MADE ITSELF KNOWN
PASSERSBY WERE PUZZLED TO SEE THE OLD MAN SUDDENLY SNATCH HIS
HEADPIECE OFF AND PEER WITH AN INTENT AND AWESTRUCK AIR INTO ITS
IRREGULAR CAVERNS
SOME OF THEM WERE SHOCKED WHEN HE SUDDENLY AND
VIGOROUSLY EJACULATED
HANNAH MARIA JEMIMY GOLDARN AN' BLUE BLAZES
HE HAD SUDDENLY REMEMBERED HAVING PLACED HIS MEMORANDA IN THAT HAT
AND AS HE STUDIED ITS EMPTY DEPTHS HIS MIND PICTURED THE IMPORTANT
SCRAP FLUTTERING ALONG THE SANDY SCENE OF HIS EARLY MORNING TUMBLE
IT
WAS THIS THAT CAUSED HIM TO GRAZE AN OATH WITH LESS MARGIN THAT HE HAD
ALLOWED HIMSELF IN TWENTY YEARS
WHAT WOULD THE OLD LADY SAY
ALAS ELDER BROWN KNEW TOO WELL
WHAT SHE WOULD NOT SAY WAS WHAT
PUZZLED HIM
BUT AS HE STOOD BAREHEADED IN THE SUNLIGHT A SENSE OF
UTTER DESOLATION CAME AND DWELT WITH HIM
HIS EYE RESTED UPON SLEEPING
BALAAM ANCHORED TO A POST IN THE STREET AND SO AS HE RECALLED THE
TREACHERY THAT LAY AT THE BASE OF ALL HIS AFFLICTION GLOOM WAS ADDED
TO THE DESOLATION
TO TURN BACK AND SEARCH FOR THE LOST PAPER WOULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN
USELESS
ONLY ONE COURSE WAS OPEN TO HIM AND AT IT WENT THE LEADER OF
HIS PEOPLE
HE CALLED AT THE GROCERY HE INVADED THE RECESSES OF THE
DRY GOODS ESTABLISHMENTS HE RANSACKED THE HARDWARE STORES AND
WHEREVER HE WENT HE MADE LIFE A BURDEN FOR THE CLERKS OVERHAULING
SHOW CASES AND PULLING DOWN WHOLE SHELVES OF STOCK
OCCASIONALLY AN
ITEM OF HIS MEMORANDA WOULD COME TO LIGHT AND THRUSTING HIS HAND INTO
HIS CAPACIOUS POCKET WHERE LAY THE PROCEEDS OF HIS CHECK HE WOULD
PAY FOR IT UPON THE SPOT AND INSIST UPON HAVING IT ROLLED UP
TO THE
SUGGESTION OF THE SLAVE WHOM HE HAD IN CHARGE FOR THE TIME BEING THAT
THE ARTICLES BE LAID ASIDE UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED HE WOULD NOT LISTEN
NOW YOU LOOK HERE SONNY HE SAID IN THE DRY GOODS STORE I'M
CONDUCTING THIS REVIVAL AN' I DON'T NEED NO HELP IN MY LINE
JUST YOU
TIE THEM STOCKIN'S UP AN' LEMME HAVE 'EM
THEN I KNOW I'VE GOT
'EM AS EACH PURCHASE WAS PROMPTLY PAID FOR AND CHANGE HAD TO BE
SECURED THE CLERK EARNED HIS SALARY FOR THAT DAY AT LEAST
SO IT WAS WHEN NEAR THE HEAT OF THE DAY THE GOOD MAN ARRIVED AT THE
DRUGSTORE THE LAST AND ONLY UNVISITED DIVISION OF TRADE HE MADE HIS
APPEARANCE EQUIPPED WITH HALF A HUNDRED PACKAGES WHICH NESTLED IN HIS
ARMS AND BULGED OUT ABOUT THE SECTIONS OF HIS CLOTHING THAT BOASTED OF
POCKETS
AS HE DEPOSITED HIS DECK LOAD UPON THE COUNTER GREAT DROPS
OF PERSPIRATION ROLLED DOWN HIS FACE AND OVER HIS WATERLOGGED COLLAR
TO THE FLOOR
THERE WAS SOMETHING EXQUISITELY REFRESHING IN THE GREAT GLASSES OF
FOAMING SODA THAT A SPRUCE YOUNG MAN WAS DRAWING FROM A MARBLE
FOUNTAIN ABOVE WHICH HALF A DOZEN POLAR BEARS IN AN AMBITIOUS PRINT
WERE DISPORTING THEMSELVES
THERE CAME A BREAK IN THE RUN OF
CUSTOMERS AND THE SPRUCE YOUNG MAN HAVING SWEPT THE FOAM FROM THE
MARBLE DEXTEROUSLY LIFTED A GLASS FROM THE REVOLVING RACK WHICH HAD
RINSED IT WITH A FIERCE LITTLE STREAM OF WATER AND ASKED
MECHANICALLY AS HE CAUGHT THE INTENSE LOOK OF THE PERSPIRING ELDER
WHAT SYRUP SIR
NOW IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO THE ELDER TO DRINK SODA BUT THE
SUGGESTION COMING AS IT DID IN HIS EXHAUSTED STATE WAS OVERPOWERING
HE DREW NEAR AWKWARDLY PUT ON HIS GLASSES AND EXAMINED THE LIST OF
SYRUPS WITH GREAT CARE
THE YOUNG MAN BEING FOR THE MOMENT AT
LEISURE SURVEYED CRITICALLY THE GAUNT FIGURE THE FADED BANDANNA THE
ANTIQUE CLAWHAMMER COAT AND THE BATTERED STOVE PIPE HAT WITH A
GRADUALLY RELAXING COUNTENANCE
HE EVEN CALLED THE PRESCRIPTION
CLERK'S ATTENTION BY A COUGH AND A QUICK JERK OF THE THUMB
THE
PRESCRIPTION CLERK SMILED FREELY AND CONTINUED HIS ASSAULTS UPON A
PIECE OF BLUE MASS
I RECKON SAID THE ELDER RESTING HIS HANDS UPON HIS KNEES AND
BENDING DOWN TO THE LIST YOU MAY GIMME SASSPRILLA AN' A LITTLE
STRAWBERRY
SASSPRILLA'S GOOD FOR THE BLOOD THIS TIME ER YEAR AN'
STRAWBERRY'S GOOD ANY TIME
THE SPRUCE YOUNG MAN LET THE SYRUP STREAM INTO THE GLASS AS HE SMILED
AFFABLY
THINKING PERHAPS TO DRAW OUT THE ODD CHARACTER HE VENTURED
UPON A JEST HIMSELF REPEATING A PUN INVENTED BY THE MAN WHO MADE THE
FIRST SODA FOUNTAIN
WITH A SWEEP OF HIS ARM HE CLEARED AWAY THE SWARM
OF INSECTS AS HE REMARKED PEOPLE WHO LIKE A FLY IN THEIRS ARE EASILY
ACCOMMODATED
IT WAS FROM SHEER GOOD NATURE ONLY THAT ELDER BROWN REPLIED WITH HIS
USUAL BROAD SOCIAL SMILE WELL A FLY NOW AN' THEN DON'T HURT
NOBODY
NOW IF THERE IS ANYBODY IN THE WORLD WHO PRIDES HIMSELF ON KNOWING A
THING OR TWO IT IS THE SPRUCE YOUNG MAN WHO PRESIDES OVER A SODA
FOUNTAIN
THIS PARTICULAR YOUNG GENTLEMAN DID NOT EVEN DEEM A REPLY
NECESSARY
HE VANISHED AN INSTANT AND WHEN HE RETURNED A CLOSE
OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE MIXTURE IN THE GLASS HE BORE HAD
SLIGHTLY CHANGED COLOR AND INCREASED IN QUANTITY
BUT THE ELDER SAW
ONLY THE WHIZZING STREAM OF WATER DART INTO ITS CENTER AND THE ROSY
FOAM RISE AND TREMBLE ON THE GLASS'S RIM
THE NEXT INSTANT HE WAS
HOLDING HIS BREATH AND SIPPING THE COOLING DRINK
AS ELDER BROWN PAID HIS SMALL SCORE HE WAS AT PEACE WITH THE WORLD
I
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS TRADING AND THE LITTLE
BLUE STRINGED PACKAGES HAD BEEN STORED AWAY COULD THE POOR DONKEY
HAVE MADE HIS APPEARANCE AT THE DOOR AND GAZED WITH HIS MEEK
FAWNLIKE EYES INTO HIS MASTER'S HE WOULD HAVE OBTAINED FULL AND FREE
FORGIVENESS
ELDER BROWN PAUSED AT THE DOOR AS HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE
A
ROSY CHEEKED SCHOOL GIRL WAS JUST LIFTING A CREAMY MIXTURE TO HER LIPS
BEFORE THE FOUNTAIN
IT WAS A PRETTY PICTURE AND HE TURNED BACK
RESOLVED TO INDULGE IN ONE MORE GLASS OF THE DELIGHTFUL BEVERAGE
BEFORE BEGINNING HIS LONG RIDE HOMEWARD
FIX IT UP AGAIN SONNY HE SAID RENEWING HIS BROAD CONFIDING
SMILE AS THE SPRUCE YOUNG MAN POISED A GLASS INQUIRINGLY
THE LIVING
AUTOMATON WENT THROUGH THE SAME MOTIONS AS BEFORE AND AGAIN ELDER
BROWN QUAFFED THE FATAL MIXTURE
WHAT A SINGULAR POWER IS HABIT UP TO THIS TIME ELDER BROWN HAD BEEN
ENTIRELY INNOCENT OF TRANSGRESSION BUT WITH THE OLD ALCOHOLIC FIRE IN
HIS VEINS TWENTY YEARS DROPPED FROM HIS SHOULDERS AND A FEELING CAME
OVER HIM FAMILIAR TO EVERY MAN WHO HAS BEEN IN HIS CUPS AS A MATTER
OF FACT THE ELDER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONFIRMED DRUNKARD TWENTY YEARS
BEFORE HAD HIS WIFE BEEN LESS STRONG MINDED
SHE TOOK THE REINS INTO
HER OWN HANDS WHEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS BUSINESS AND STRONG DRINK DID
NOT MIX WELL WORKED HIM INTO THE CHURCH SUSTAINED HIS RESOLUTIONS BY
MAKING IT DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS FOR HIM TO GET TO HIS TODDY
SHE
BECAME THE BUSINESS HEAD OF THE FAMILY AND HE THE SPIRITUAL
ONLY AT
RARE INTERVALS DID HE EVER BACKSLIDE DURING THE TWENTY YEARS OF THE
NEW ERA AND MRS
BROWN HERSELF USED TO SAY THAT THE SUGAR IN HIS'N
TURNED TO GALL BEFORE THE BACKSLIDE ENDED PEOPLE WHO KNEW HER NEVER
DOUBTED IT
BUT ELDER BROWN'S SIN DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY CONTAINED AN
ELEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY
AS HE MOVED MAJESTICALLY DOWN TOWARD WHERE
BALAAM SLEPT IN THE SUNLIGHT HE FELT NO FATIGUE
THERE WAS A GLOW
UPON HIS CHEEK BONES AND A FAINT TINGE UPON HIS PROMINENT NOSE
HE
NODDED FAMILIARLY TO PEOPLE AS HE MET THEM AND SAW NOT THE LOOK OF
AMUSEMENT WHICH SUCCEEDED ASTONISHMENT UPON THE VARIOUS FACES
WHEN HE
REACHED THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BALAAM IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE
MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN SOME ONE OF HIS NUMEROUS COMMISSIONS AND HE
PAUSED TO THINK
THEN A BRILLIANT IDEA ROSE IN HIS MIND
HE WOULD
FORESTALL BLAME AND DISARM ANGER WITH KINDNESS HE WOULD PURCHASE
HANNAH A BONNET
WHAT WOMAN'S HEART EVER FAILED TO SOFTEN AT SIGHT OF A NEW BONNET
AS I HAVE STATED THE ELDER WAS A MAN OF ACTION
HE ENTERED A STORE
NEAR AT HAND
GOOD MORNING SAID AN AFFABLE GENTLEMAN WITH A HEBREW COUNTENANCE
APPROACHING
GOOD MORNIN' GOOD MORNIN' SAID THE ELDER PILING HIS BUNDLES ON
THE COUNTER
I HOPE YOU ARE WELL ELDER BROWN EXTENDED HIS HAND
FERVIDLY
QUITE WELL I THANK YOU
WHAT
AND THE LITTLE WIFE SAID ELDER BROWN AFFECTIONATELY RETAINING THE
JEW'S HAND
QUITE WELL SIR
AND THE LITTLE ONES QUITE WELL I HOPE TOO
YES SIR ALL WELL THANK YOU
SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU
THE AFFABLE MERCHANT WAS TRYING TO RECALL HIS CUSTOMER'S NAME
NOT NOW NOT NOW THANKEE
IF YOU PLEASE TO LET MY BUNDLES STAY
UNTELL I COME BACK
CAN'T I SHOW YOU SOMETHING HAT COAT
NOT NOW
BE BACK BIMEBY
WAS IT CHANCE OR FATE THAT BROUGHT ELDER BROWN IN FRONT OF A BAR THE
GLASSES SHONE BRIGHT UPON THE SHELVES AS THE SWINGING DOOR FLAPPED
BACK TO LET OUT A COATLESS CLERK WHO PASSED HIM WITH A RUSH CHEWING
UPON A FAREWELL MOUTHFUL OF BROWN BREAD AND BOLOGNA
ELDER BROWN
BEHELD FOR AN INSTANT THE FAMILIAR SCENE WITHIN
THE SCREWS OF HIS
RESOLUTION HAD BEEN LOOSENED
AT SIGHT OF THE GLISTENING BAR THE WHOLE
MORAL STRUCTURE OF TWENTY YEARS CAME TUMBLING DOWN
MECHANICALLY HE
ENTERED THE SALOON AND LAID A SILVER QUARTER UPON THE BAR AS HE SAID
A LITTLE WHISKEY AN' SUGAR THE ARMS OF THE BARTENDER WORKED LIKE A
FAKER'S IN A SIDE SHOW AS HE SET OUT THE GLASS WITH ITS LITTLE QUOTA
OF SHORT SWEETENING AND A CUT GLASS DECANTER AND SENT A
HALF TUMBLER OF WATER SPINNING ALONG FROM THE UPPER END OF THE BAR
WITH A DIME IN CHANGE
WHISKEY IS HIGHER'N USED TO BE SAID ELDER BROWN BUT THE BARTENDER
WAS TAKING ANOTHER ORDER AND DID NOT HEAR HIM
ELDER BROWN STIRRED
AWAY THE SUGAR AND LET A STEADY STREAM OF RED LIQUID FLOW INTO THE
GLASS
HE SWALLOWED THE DRINK AS UNCONCERNEDLY AS THOUGH HIS MORNING
TOD HAD NEVER BEEN SUSPENDED AND POCKETED THE CHANGE
BUT IT AIN'T
ANY BETTER THAN IT WAS HE CONCLUDED AS HE PASSED OUT
HE DID NOT
EVEN SEEM TO REALIZE THAT HE HAD DONE ANYTHING EXTRAORDINARY
THERE WAS A MILLINERY STORE UP THE STREET AND THITHER WITH UNCERTAIN
STEP HE WENDED HIS WAY FEELING A LITTLE MORE ELATE AND ALTOGETHER
SOCIABLE
A PRETTY BLACK EYED GIRL STRUGGLING TO KEEP DOWN HER
MIRTH CAME FORWARD AND FACED HIM BEHIND THE COUNTER
ELDER BROWN
LIFTED HIS FADED HAT WITH THE POLITENESS IF NOT THE GRACE OF A
CASTILIAN AND MADE A SWEEPING BOW
AGAIN HE WAS IN HIS ELEMENT
BUT
HE DID NOT SPEAK
A SHOWER OF ODDS AND ENDS SMALL PACKAGES THREAD
NEEDLES AND BUTTONS RELEASED FROM THEIR PRISON RATTLED DOWN ABOUT
HIM
THE GIRL LAUGHED
SHE COULD NOT HELP IT
AND THE ELDER LEANING HIS
HAND ON THE COUNTER LAUGHED TOO UNTIL SEVERAL OTHER GIRLS CAME
HALF WAY TO THE FRONT
THEN THEY HIDING BEHIND COUNTERS AND SUSPENDED
CLOAKS LAUGHED AND SNICKERED UNTIL THEY RECONVULSED THE ELDER'S
VIS VIS WHO HAD BEEN MAKING DESPERATE EFFORTS TO RESUME HER DEMURE
APPEARANCE
LET ME HELP YOU SIR SHE SAID COMING FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER UPON
SEEING ELDER BROWN BEGINNING TO ADJUST HIS SPECTACLES FOR A SEARCH
HE
WAVED HER BACK MAJESTICALLY
NO MY DEAR NO CAN'T ALLOW IT
YOU
MOUT SILE THEM PURTY FINGERS
NO MA'AM
NO GEN'L'MAN'LL 'LOW ER LADY
TO DO SUCH A THING THE ELDER WAS GENTLY FORCING THE GIRL BACK TO HER
PLACE
LEAVE IT TO ME
I'VE PICKED UP BIGGER THINGS 'N THEM
PICKED
MYSELF UP THIS MORNIN'
BALAAM YOU DON'T KNOW BALAAM HE'S MY
DONKEY HE TUMBLED ME OVER HIS HEAD IN THE SAND THIS MORNIN' AND
ELDER BROWN HAD TO RESUME AN UPRIGHT POSITION UNTIL HIS PAROXYSM OF
LAUGHTER HAD PASSED
YOU SEE THIS OLD HAT EXTENDING IT HALF FULL
OF PACKAGES I FELL CLEAR INTER IT JES' AS CLEAN INTER IT AS THEM
THINGS THAR FELL OUT'N IT HE LAUGHED AGAIN AND SO DID THE GIRLS
BUT MY DEAR I WHALED HALF THE HIDE OFF'N HIM FOR IT
OH SIR HOW COULD YOU INDEED SIR
I THINK YOU DID WRONG
THE POOR
BRUTE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING I DARE SAY AND PROBABLY HE HAS
BEEN A FAITHFUL FRIEND THE GIRL CAST HER MISCHIEVOUS EYES TOWARDS
HER COMPANIONS WHO SNICKERED AGAIN
THE OLD MAN WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF
THE SARCASM
HE ONLY SAW REPROACH
HIS FACE STRAIGHTENED AND HE
REGARDED THE GIRL SOBERLY
MEBBE YOU'RE RIGHT MY DEAR MEBBE I OUGHTN'T
I AM SURE OF IT SAID THE GIRL
BUT NOW DON'T YOU WANT TO BUY A
BONNET OR A CLOAK TO CARRY HOME TO YOUR WIFE
WELL YOU'RE WHISTLIN' NOW BIRDIE THAT'S MY INTENTION SET 'EM ALL
OUT AGAIN THE ELDER'S FACE SHONE WITH DELIGHT
AN' I DON'T WANT NO
ONE HOSS BONNET NEITHER
OF COURSE NOT
NOW HERE IS ONE PINK SILK WITH DELICATE PALE BLUE
FEATHERS
JUST THE THING FOR THE SEASON
WE HAVE NOTHING MORE ELEGANT
IN STOCK ELDER BROWN HELD IT OUT UPSIDE DOWN AT ARM'S LENGTH
WELL NOW THAT'S SUTHIN' LIKE
WILL IT SOOT A SORTER REDHEADED
'OOMAN
A PERFECTLY SOBER MAN WOULD HAVE SAID THE GIRL'S CORSETS MUST HAVE
UNDERGONE A TERRIBLE STRAIN BUT THE ELDER DID NOT NOTICE HER DUMB
CONVULSION
SHE ANSWERED HEROICALLY
PERFECTLY SIR
IT IS AN EXQUISITE MATCH
I THINK YOU'RE WHISTLIN' AGAIN
NANCY'S HEAD'S RED RED AS A
WOODPECK'S
SORREL'S ONLY HALF WAY TO THE COLOR OF HER TOP KNOT AN'
IT DO SEEM LIKE RED OUGHTER TO SOOT RED
NANCY'S RED AN' THE HAT'S
RED LIKE GOES WITH LIKE AN' BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER THE
OLD MAN LAUGHED UNTIL HIS CHEEKS WERE WET
THE GIRL BEGINNING TO FEEL A LITTLE UNEASY AND SEEING A CUSTOMER
ENTERING RAPIDLY FIXED UP THE BONNET TOOK FIFTEEN DOLLARS OUT OF A
TWENTY DOLLAR BILL AND CALMLY ASKED THE ELDER IF HE WANTED ANYTHING
ELSE
HE THRUST HIS CHANGE SOMEWHERE INTO HIS CLOTHES AND BEAT A
RETREAT
IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NEARLY DRUNK
ELDER BROWN'S STEP BEGAN TO LOSE ITS BUOYANCY
HE FOUND HIMSELF
UTTERLY UNABLE TO WALK STRAIGHT
THERE WAS AN UNCERTAIN STRADDLE IN
HIS GAIT THAT CARRIED HIM FROM ONE SIDE OF THE WALK TO THE OTHER AND
CAUSED PEOPLE WHOM HE MET TO CHEERFULLY YIELD HIM PLENTY OF ROOM
BALAAM SAW HIM COMING
POOR BALAAM
HE HAD MADE AN EARLY START THAT
DAY AND FOR HOURS HE STOOD IN THE SUN AWAITING RELIEF
WHEN HE OPENED
HIS SLEEPY EYES AND RAISED HIS EXPRESSIVE EARS TO A POSITION OF
ATTENTION THE OLD FAMILIAR COAT AND BATTERED HAT OF THE ELDER WERE
BEFORE HIM
HE LIFTED UP HIS HONEST VOICE AND CRIED ALOUD FOR JOY
THE EFFECT WAS ELECTRICAL FOR ONE INSTANT
ELDER BROWN SURVEYED THE
BEAST WITH HORROR BUT AGAIN IN HIS UNDERSTANDING THERE RANG OUT THE
TRUMPET WORDS
DRUNK DRUNK DRUNK DRER UNC ER UNC UNC UNC
HE STOOPED INSTINCTIVELY FOR A MISSILE WITH WHICH TO SMITE HIS
ACCUSER BUT BROUGHT UP SUDDENLY WITH A JERK AND A HANDFUL OF SAND
STRAIGHTENING HIMSELF UP WITH A MAJESTIC DIGNITY HE EXTENDED HIS
RIGHT HAND IMPRESSIVELY
YOU'RE A GOLDARN LIAR BALAAM AND BLAST YOUR OLD BUTTONS YOU KIN
WALK HOME BY YOURSELF FOR I'M DANGED IF YOU SH'LL RIDE ME ER STEP
SURELY CORIOLANUS NEVER TURNED HIS BACK UPON ROME WITH A GRANDER
DIGNITY THAN SAT UPON THE OLD MAN'S FORM AS HE FACED ABOUT AND LEFT
THE BRUTE TO SURVEY WITH ANXIOUS EYES THE NEW DEPARTURE OF HIS MASTER
HE SAW THE ELDER ZIGZAG ALONG THE STREET AND BEHELD HIM ABOUT TO TURN
A FRIENDLY CORNER
ONCE MORE HE LIFTED UP HIS MIGHTY VOICE
DRUNK DRUNK DRUNK DRER UNC DRER UNC ERUNC UNC UNC
ONCE MORE THE ELDER TURNED WITH LIFTED HAND AND SHOUTED BACK
YOU'RE A LIAR BALAAM GOLDARN YOU YOU'RE ER IFFAMOUS LIAR THEN HE
PASSED FROM VIEW
III
MRS
BROWN STOOD UPON THE STEPS ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE RETURN OF HER
LIEGE LORD
SHE KNEW HE HAD WITH HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY OR SHOULD
HAVE AND SHE KNEW ALSO THAT HE WAS A MAN WITHOUT BUSINESS METHODS
SHE HAD LONG SINCE REPENTED OF THE DECISION WHICH SENT HIM TO TOWN
WHEN THE OLD BATTERED HAT AND FLOUR COVERED COAT LOOMED UP IN THE
GLOAMING AND CONFRONTED HER SHE STARED WITH TERROR
THE NEXT INSTANT
SHE HAD SEIZED HIM
FOR THE LORD SAKES ELDER BROWN WHAT AILS YOU AS I LIVE IF THE MAN
AIN'T DRUNK ELDER BROWN ELDER BROWN FOR THE LIFE OF ME CAN'T I MAKE
YOU HEAR YOU CRAZY OLD HYPOCRITE YOU DESAVIN' OLD SINNER YOU
BLACK HEARTED WRETCH WHERE HAVE YOU BEN
THE ELDER MADE AN EFFORT TO WAVE HER OFF
WOMAN HE SAID WITH GRAND DIGNITY YOU FORGIT YUS SEF SHU KNOW
WARE I'VE BEN 'SWELL'S I DO
BEN TO TOWN WIFE AN' SEE YER WAT I'VE
BROUGHT THE FINES' HAT OLE WOMAN I COULD GIT
LOOK'T THE COLOR

WHAT YER MEAN HEY HOLE ON OLE WOMAN YOU HANNAH YOU SHE
LITERALLY SHOOK HIM INTO SILENCE
YOU MISERABLE WRETCH YOU LOW DOWN DRUNKEN SOT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY
COMING HOME AND INSULTING YOUR WIFE HANNAH CEASED SHAKING HIM FROM
PURE EXHAUSTION
WHERE IS IT I SAY WHERE IS IT
BY THIS TIME SHE WAS TURNING HIS POCKETS WRONG SIDE OUT
FROM ONE SHE
GOT PILLS FROM ANOTHER CHANGE FROM ANOTHER PACKAGES
THE LORD BE PRAISED AND THIS IS BETTER LUCK THAN I HOPED OH ELDER
ELDER ELDER WHAT DID YOU DO IT FOR WHY MAN WHERE IS BALAAM
THOUGHT OF THE BEAST CHOKED OFF THE THREATENED HYSTERICS
BALAAM BALAAM SAID THE ELDER GROGGILY
HE'S IN TOWN
THE
INFERNAL OLE FOOL 'SULTED ME AN' I LEF' HIM TO WALK HOME
HIS WIFE SURVEYED HIM
REALLY AT THAT MOMENT SHE DID THINK HIS MIND
WAS GONE BUT THE LEER UPON THE OLD MAN'S FACE ENRAGED HER BEYOND
ENDURANCE
YOU DID DID YOU WELL NOW I RECKON YOU'LL LAUGH FOR SOME CAUSE
YOU WILL
BACK YOU GO SIR STRAIGHT BACK AN' DON'T YOU COME HOME
'THOUT THAT DONKEY OR YOU'LL RUE IT SURE AS MY NAME IS HANNAH BROWN
ALECK YOU ALECK K K
A BLACK BOY DARTED ROUND THE CORNER FROM BEHIND WHICH WITH SEVERAL
OTHERS HE HAD BEHELD THE BRIEF BUT STIRRING SCENE
PUT A SADDLE ON ER MULE
THE ELDER'S GWINE BACK TO TOWN
AND DON'T
YOU BE LONG ABOUT IT NEITHER
YESSUM ALECK'S IVORIES GLEAMED IN THE DARKNESS AS HE DISAPPEARED
ELDER BROWN WAS SOBERER AT THAT MOMENT THAN HE HAD BEEN FOR HOURS
HANNAH YOU DON'T MEAN IT
YES SIR I DO
BACK YOU GO TO TOWN AS SURE AS MY NAME IS HANNAH
BROWN
THE ELDER WAS SILENT
HE HAD NEVER KNOWN HIS WIFE TO RELENT ON ANY
OCCASION AFTER SHE HAD AFFIRMED HER INTENTION SUPPLEMENTED WITH AS
SURE AS MY NAME IS HANNAH BROWN IT WAS HER WAY OF SWEARING
NO
AFFIDAVIT WOULD HAVE HAD HALF THE CLAIM UPON HER AS THAT SIMPLE
ENUNCIATION
SO BACK TO TOWN WENT ELDER BROWN NOT IN THE ORDER OF THE EARLY MORN
BUT SILENTLY MOODILY DESPAIRINGLY SURROUNDED BY MENTAL AND ACTUAL
GLOOM
THE OLD MAN HAD TURNED A LAST APPEALING GLANCE UPON THE ANGRY WOMAN
AS HE MOUNTED WITH ALECK'S ASSISTANCE AND SAT IN THE LIGHT THAT
STREAMED FROM OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW
SHE MET THE GLANCE WITHOUT A
WAVER
SHE MEANS IT AS SURE AS MY NAME IS ELDER BROWN HE SAID THICKLY
THEN HE RODE ON
IV
TO SAY THAT ELDER BROWN SUFFERED ON THIS LONG JOURNEY BACK TO MACON
WOULD ONLY MILDLY OUTLINE HIS EXPERIENCE
HIS EARLY MORNING'S FALL HAD
BEGUN TO MAKE ITSELF FELT
HE WAS SORE AND UNCOMFORTABLE
BESIDES HIS
STOMACH WAS EMPTY AND CALLED FOR TWO MEALS IT HAD MISSED FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN YEARS
WHEN SORE AND WEARY THE ELDER ENTERED THE CITY THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS
SHONE ABOVE IT LIKE JEWELS IN A CROWN
THE CITY SLEPT THAT IS THE
BETTER PORTION OF IT DID
HERE AND THERE HOWEVER THE LOWER LIGHTS
FLASHED OUT INTO THE NIGHT
MOODILY THE ELDER PURSUED HIS JOURNEY AND
AS HE RODE FAR OFF IN THE NIGHT THERE ROSE AND QUIVERED A PLAINTIVE
CRY
ELDER BROWN SMILED WEARILY IT WAS BALAAM'S APPEAL AND HE
RECOGNIZED IT
THE ANIMAL HE RODE ALSO RECOGNIZED IT AND REPLIED
UNTIL THE SILENCE OF THE CITY WAS DESTROYED
THE ODD CLAMOR AND
CONFUSION DREW FROM A SALOON NEAR BY A GROUP OF NOISY YOUNGSTERS WHO
HAD BEEN MAKING A NIGHT OF IT
THEY SURROUNDED ELDER BROWN AS HE BEGAN
TO TRANSFER HIMSELF TO THE HUNGRY BEAST TO WHOSE MOTION HE WAS MORE
ACCUSTOMED AND IN THE HAIL FELLOW WELL MET STYLE OF THE DAY BEGAN
TO BANDY JESTS UPON HIS APPEARANCE
NOW ELDER BROWN WAS NOT IN A
JESTING HUMOR
POSITIVELY HE WAS IN THE WORST HUMOR POSSIBLE
THE
RESULT WAS THAT BEFORE MANY MINUTES PASSED THE OLD MAN WAS SWINGING
SEVERAL OF THE CROWD BY THEIR COLLARS AND BREAKING THE PEACE OF THE
CITY
A POLICEMAN APPROACHED AND BUT FOR THE GOOD HUMORED PARTY UPON
WHOM THE ELDER'S PLUCK HAD MADE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION WOULD HAVE RUN
THE OLD MAN INTO THE BARRACKS
THE CROWD HOWEVER DREW HIM LAUGHINGLY
INTO THE SALOON AND TO THE BAR
THE REACTION WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS
HALF RALLIED SENSES
HE YIELDED AGAIN
THE REVIVING LIQUOR PASSED HIS
LIPS
GLOOM VANISHED
HE BECAME ONE OF THE BOYS
THE COMPANY INTO WHICH ELDER BROWN HAD FALLEN WAS WHAT IS KNOWN AS
FIRST CLASS TO SUCH NOTHING IS SO CAPTIVATING AS AN ADVENTURE OUT
OF THE COMMON RUN OF ACCIDENTS
THE GAUNT COUNTRYMAN WITH HIS
BATTERED HAT AND CLAW HAMMER COAT WAS A PRIZE OF AN EXTRAORDINARY
NATURE
THEY DREW HIM INTO A REAR ROOM WHOSE GILDED FRAMES AND
POLISHED TABLES BETRAYED THE CHARACTER AND PURPOSE OF THE PLACE AND
PLIED HIM WITH WINE UNTIL TEN THOUSAND LIGHTS DANCED ABOUT HIM
THE
FUN INCREASED
ONE YOUNGSTER MADE A POLITICAL SPEECH FROM THE TOP OF
THE TABLE ANOTHER IMPERSONATED HAMLET AND FINALLY ELDER BROWN WAS
LIFTED INTO A CHAIR AND SANG A CAMP MEETING SONG
THIS WAS RENDERED
BY HIM WITH STARTLING EFFECT
HE STOOD UPRIGHT WITH HIS HAT JAUNTILY
KNOCKED TO ONE SIDE AND HIS COAT TAILS ORNAMENTED WITH A COUPLE OF
SHOW BILLS KINDLY PINNED ON BY HIS ADMIRERS
IN HIS LEFT HAND HE
WAVED THE STUB OF A CIGAR AND ON HIS BACK WAS AN ADMIRABLE
REPRESENTATION OF BALAAM'S HEAD EXECUTED BY SOME ARTIST WITH BILLIARD
CHALK
AS THE ELDER SANG HIS FAVORITE HYMN I'M GLAD SALVATION'S FREE HIS
STENTORIAN VOICE AWOKE THE ECHOES
MOST OF THE COMPANY ROLLED UPON THE
FLOOR IN CONVULSIONS OF LAUGHTER
THE EXHIBITION CAME TO A CLOSE BY THE CHAIR OVERTURNING
AGAIN ELDER
BROWN FELL INTO HIS BELOVED HAT
HE AROSE AND SHOUTED WHOA BALAAM
AGAIN HE SEIZED THE NEAREST WEAPON AND SOUGHT SATISFACTION
THE YOUNG
GENTLEMAN WITH POLITICAL SENTIMENTS WAS KNOCKED UNDER THE TABLE AND
HAMLET ONLY ESCAPED INJURY BY BEATING THE INFURIATED ELDER INTO THE
STREET
WHAT NEXT WELL I HARDLY KNOW
HOW THE ELDER FOUND BALAAM IS A
MYSTERY YET NOT THAT BALAAM WAS HARD TO FIND BUT THAT THE OLD MAN
WAS IN NO CONDITION TO FIND ANYTHING
STILL HE DID AND CLIMBING
LABORIOUSLY INTO THE SADDLE HE HELD ON STUPIDLY WHILE THE HUNGRY
BEAST STRUCK OUT FOR HOME
V
HANNAH BROWN DID NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT
SLEEP WOULD NOT COME
HOUR
AFTER HOUR PASSED AND HER WRATH REFUSED TO BE QUELLED
SHE TRIED
EVERY CONCEIVABLE METHOD BUT TIME HUNG HEAVILY
IT WAS NOT QUITE PEEP
OF DAY HOWEVER WHEN SHE LAID HER WELL WORN FAMILY BIBLE ASIDE
IT
HAD BEEN HER MOTHER'S AND AMID ALL THE ANXIETIES AND TRIBULATIONS
INCIDENT TO THE LIFE OF A WOMAN WHO HAD FREE NEGROES AND A MISERABLE
HUSBAND TO MANAGE IT HAD BEEN HER MAINSTAY AND COMFORT
SHE HAD
FREQUENTLY READ IT IN ANGER PAGE AFTER PAGE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT WAS
CONTAINED IN THE LINES
BUT EVENTUALLY THE WORDS BECAME INTELLIGIBLE
AND TOOK MEANING
SHE WRESTED CONSOLATION FROM IT BY MERE FORCE OF
WILL
AND SO ON THIS OCCASION WHEN SHE CLOSED THE BOOK THE FIERCE ANGER WAS
GONE
SHE WAS NOT A HARD WOMAN NATURALLY
FATE HAD BROUGHT HER CONDITIONS
WHICH COVERED UP THE WOMAN HEART WITHIN HER BUT THOUGH IT LAY DEEP
IT WAS THERE STILL
AS SHE SAT WITH FOLDED HANDS HER EYES FELL
UPON WHAT
THE PINK BONNET WITH THE BLUE PLUME
IT MAY APPEAR STRANGE TO THOSE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND SUCH NATURES BUT
TO ME HER NEXT ACTION WAS PERFECTLY NATURAL
SHE BURST INTO A
CONVULSIVE LAUGH THEN SEIZING THE QUEER OBJECT BENT HER FACE UPON
IT AND SOBBED HYSTERICALLY
WHEN THE STORM WAS OVER VERY TENDERLY SHE
LAID THE GIFT ASIDE AND BARE HEADED PASSED OUT INTO THE NIGHT
FOR A HALF HOUR SHE STOOD AT THE END OF THE LANE AND THEN HUNGRY
BALAAM AND HIS MASTER HOVE IN SIGHT
REACHING OUT HER HAND SHE
CHECKED THE BEAST
WILLIAM SAID SHE VERY GENTLY WHERE IS THE MULE
THE ELDER HAD BEEN ASLEEP
HE WOKE AND GAZED UPON HER BLANKLY
WHAT MULE HANNAH
THE MULE YOU RODE TO TOWN
FOR ONE FULL MINUTE THE ELDER STUDIED HER FACE
THEN IT BURST FROM HIS
LIPS
WELL BLESS ME IF I DIDN'T BRING BALAAM AND FORGIT THE MULE
THE WOMAN LAUGHED TILL HER EYES RAN WATER
WILLIAM SAID SHE YOU'RE DRUNK
HANNAH SAID HE MEEKLY I KNOW IT
THE TRUTH IS HANNAH I

THE HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MR
PINK FLUKER
BY RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON 1822 1898
FROM THE CENTURY MAGAZINE JUNE 1886 COPYRIGHT 1886 BY THE
CENTURY CO REPUBLISHED IN THE VOLUME MR
ABSALOM BILLINGSLEA AND
OTHER GEORGIA FOLK 1888 BY RICHARD MALCOLM JOHNSTON HARPER
BROTHERS
I
MR
PETERSON FLUKER GENERALLY CALLED PINK FOR HIS FONDNESS FOR AS
STYLISH DRESSING AS HE COULD AFFORD WAS ONE OF THAT SORT OF MEN WHO
HABITUALLY SEEM BUSY AND EFFICIENT WHEN THEY ARE NOT
HE HAD THE
BUSTLING ACTIVITY OFTEN NOTICEABLE IN MEN OF HIS SIZE AND IN ONE WAY
AND ANOTHER HAD MADE UP AS HE BELIEVED FOR BEING SO MUCH SMALLER
THAN MOST OF HIS ADULT ACQUAINTANCE OF THE MALE SEX
PROMINENT AMONG
HIS ACHIEVEMENTS ON THAT LINE WAS GETTING MARRIED TO A WOMAN WHO
AMONG OTHER EXCELLENT GIFTS HAD THAT OF BEING TWICE AS BIG AS HER
HUSBAND
FOOL WHO ON THE DAY AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE HAD ASKED WITH A LOOK AT
THOSE WHO HAD OFTEN SAID THAT HE WAS TOO LITTLE TO HAVE A WIFE
THEY HAD A LITTLE PROPERTY TO BEGIN WITH A COUPLE OF HUNDREDS OF
ACRES AND TWO OR THREE NEGROES APIECE
YET EXCEPT IN THE NATURAL
INCREASE OF THE LATTER THE ACCRETIONS OF WORLDLY ESTATE HAD BEEN
INCONSIDERABLE TILL NOW WHEN THEIR OLDEST CHILD MARANN WAS SOME
FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
THESE ACCRETIONS HAD BEEN SAVED AND TAKEN CARE OF
BY MRS
FLUKER WHO WAS AS STAID AND SILENT AS HE WAS MOBILE AND
VOLUBLE
MR
FLUKER OFTEN SAID THAT IT PUZZLED HIM HOW IT WAS THAT HE MADE
SMALLER CROPS THAN MOST OF HIS NEIGHBORS WHEN IF NOT ALWAYS
CONVINCING HE COULD GENERALLY PUT EVERY ONE OF THEM TO SILENCE IN
DISCUSSIONS UPON AGRICULTURAL TOPICS
THIS PUZZLE HAD LED HIM TO NOT
UNFREQUENT RUMINATIONS IN HIS MIND AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HIS VOCATION
MIGHT LIE IN SOMETHING HIGHER THAN THE MERE TILLING OF THE GROUND
THESE RUMINATIONS HAD LATELY TAKEN A DEFINITE DIRECTION AND IT WAS
AFTER SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WHICH HE HAD HELD WITH HIS FRIEND MATT
PIKE
MR
MATT PIKE WAS A BACHELOR OF SOME THIRTY SUMMERS A FORETIME CLERK
CONSECUTIVELY IN EACH OF THE TWO STORES OF THE VILLAGE BUT LATTERLY A
TRADER ON A LIMITED SCALE IN HORSES WAGONS COWS AND SIMILAR OBJECTS
OF COMMERCE AND AT ALL TIMES A POLITICIAN
HIS HOPES OF HOLDING
OFFICE HAD BEEN CONTINUALLY DISAPPOINTED UNTIL MR
JOHN SANKS BECAME
SHERIFF AND REWARDED WITH A DEPUTYSHIP SOME IMPORTANT SPECIAL SERVICE
RENDERED BY HIM IN THE LATE VERY CLOSE CANVASS
NOW WAS A CHANCE TO
RISE MR
PIKE THOUGHT
ALL HE WANTED HE HAD OFTEN SAID WAS A START
POLITICS I WOULD REMARK HOWEVER HAD BEEN REGARDED BY MR
PIKE AS A
MEANS RATHER THAN AN END
IT IS DOUBTFUL IF HE HOPED TO BECOME
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE AT LEAST BEFORE AN ADVANCED PERIOD IN HIS
CAREER
HIS MAIN OBJECT NOW WAS TO GET MONEY AND HE BELIEVED THAT
OFFICIAL POSITION WOULD PROMOTE HIM IN THE LINE OF HIS AMBITION FASTER
THAN WAS POSSIBLE TO ANY PRIVATE STATION BY LEADING HIM INTO MORE
EXTENSIVE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MANKIND THEIR NEEDS THEIR DESIRES AND
THEIR CAPRICES
A DEPUTY SHERIFF PROVIDED THAT LAWYERS WERE NOT TOO
INDULGENT IN ALLOWING ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF SERVICE OF COURT PROCESSES IN
POSTPONING LEVIES AND SALES AND IN SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATED CASES
MIGHT PICK UP THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A GOOD SUM FOR THOSE TIMES A
FACT WHICH MR
PIKE HAD KNOWN AND PONDERED LONG
IT HAPPENED JUST ABOUT THEN THAT THE ARREARS OF RENT FOR THE VILLAGE
HOTEL HAD SO ACCUMULATED ON MR
SPOUTER THE LAST OCCUPANT THAT THE
OWNER AN INDULGENT MAN FINALLY HAD SAID WHAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED
FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO SAY THAT HE COULD NOT WAIT ON MR
SPOUTER
FOREVER AND ETERNALLY
IT WAS AT THIS VERY NICK SO TO SPEAK THAT MR
PIKE MADE TO MR
FLUKER THE SUGGESTION TO QUIT A BUSINESS SO FAR
BENEATH HIS POWERS SELL OUT OR RENT OUT OR TENANT OUT OR DO
SOMETHING ELSE WITH HIS FARM MARCH INTO TOWN PLANT HIMSELF UPON THE
RUINS OF JACOB SPOUTER AND BEGIN HIS UPWARD SOAR
NOW MR
FLUKER HAD MANY AND MANY A TIME ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD
AMBITION SO ONE NIGHT HE SAID TO HIS WIFE
YOU SEE HOW IT IS HERE NERVY
FARMIN' SOMEHOW DON'T SUIT MY TALONS
I NEED TO BE FLUNG MORE 'MONG PEOPLE TO FETCH OUT WHAT'S IN ME
THEN
THAR'S MARANN WHICH IS GITTIN' TO BE NIGH ON TO A GROWD UP WOMAN AN'
THE CHILD NEED THE S'IETY WHICH YOU 'BLEEGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS SCA'CE
ABOUT HERE SIX MILE FROM TOWN
YOUR BRER SAM CAN STAY HERE AN' RAISE
BUTTER CHICKENS EGGS PIGS AN' AN' AN' SO FORTH
MATT PIKE SAY HE
JES' KNOW THEY'S MONEY IN IT AN' SPECIAL WITH A HOUSEKEEPER KEERFUL
AN' EQUINOMICAL LIKE YOU
IT IS ALWAYS CURIOUS THE EXTENT OF INFLUENCE THAT SOME MEN HAVE UPON
WIVES WHO ARE THEIR SUPERIORS
MRS
FLUKER IN SPITE OF ACCIDENTS HAD
EVER SET UPON HER HUSBAND A VALUE THAT WAS NOT RECOGNIZED OUTSIDE OF
HIS FAMILY
IN THIS RESPECT THERE SEEMS A SURPRISING COMPENSATION IN
HUMAN LIFE
BUT THIS REMARK I MAKE ONLY IN PASSING
MRS
FLUKER
ADMITTING IN HER HEART THAT FARMING WAS NOT HER HUSBAND'S FORTE
HOPED LIKE A TRUE WIFE THAT IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE NEW FIELD TO
WHICH HE ASPIRED
BESIDES SHE DID NOT FORGET THAT HER BROTHER SAM HAD
SAID TO HER SEVERAL TIMES PRIVATELY THAT IF HIS BRER PINK WOULDN'T
HAVE SO MANY NOTIONS AND WOULD LET HIM ALONE IN HIS MANAGEMENT THEY
WOULD ALL DO BETTER
SHE REFLECTED FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THEN SAID
MAYBE IT'S BEST MR
FLUKER
I'M WILLIN' TO TRY IT FOR A YEAR
ANYHOW
WE CAN'T LOSE MUCH BY THAT
AS FOR MATT PIKE I HAIN'T THE
CONFIDENCE IN HIM YOU HAS
STILL HE BEIN' A BOARDER AND DEPUTY
SHERIFF HE MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY DO US SOME GOOD
I'LL TRY IT FOR A YEAR
PROVIDIN' YOU'LL FETCH ME THE MONEY AS IT'S PAID IN FOR YOU KNOW I
KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THAT BETTER'N YOU DO AND YOU KNOW I'LL TRY TO
MANAGE IT AND ALL THE REST OF THE BUSINESS FOR THE BEST
TO THIS PROVISION MR
FLUKER GAVE CONSENT QUALIFIED BY THE CLAIM THAT
HE WAS TO RETAIN A SMALL MARGIN FOR INDISPENSABLE PERSONAL EXIGENCIES
FOR HE CONTENDED PERHAPS WITH JUSTICE THAT NO MAN IN THE RESPONSIBLE
POSITION HE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE OUGHT TO BE EXPECTED TO GO ABOUT OR SIT
ABOUT OR EVEN LOUNGE ABOUT WITHOUT EVEN A CONTINENTAL RED IN HIS
POCKET
THE NEW HOUSE I SAY NEW BECAUSE TONGUE COULD NOT TELL THE AMOUNT OF
SCOURING SCALDING AND WHITEWASHING THAT THAT EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER
HAD DONE BEFORE A SINGLE STICK OF HER FURNITURE WENT INTO IT THE NEW
HOUSE I REPEAT OPENED WITH SIX EATING BOARDERS AT TEN DOLLARS A
MONTH APIECE AND TWO EATING AND SLEEPING AT ELEVEN BESIDES MR
PIKE
WHO MADE A SPECIAL CONTRACT
TRANSIENT CUSTOM WAS HOPED TO HOLD ITS
OWN AND THAT OF THE COUNTY PEOPLE UNDER THE DEPUTY'S PATRONAGE AND
INFLUENCE TO BE CONSIDERABLY ENLARGED
IN WORDS AND OTHER ENCOURAGEMENT MR
PIKE WAS PRONOUNCED
HE COULD
COMMEND HONESTLY AND HE DID SO CORDIALLY
THE THING TO DO PINK IS TO HAVE YOUR PRICES REG'LAR AND MAKE
PEOPLE PAY UP REG'LAR
TEN DOLLARS FOR EATIN' JES' SO ELEB'N FOR
EATIN' AN SLEEPIN' HALF A DOLLAR FOR DINNER JES' SO QUARTER
APIECE FOR BREAKFAST SUPPER AND BED IS WHAT I CALL REASON'BLE BO'D
AS FOR ME I SCA'CELY KNOW HOW TO RIG'LATE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M A'
OFFICER NOW AN' IN COURSE I NATCHEL HAS TO BE AWAY SOMETIMES AN' ON
EXPENSES AT 'TOTHER PLACES AN' IT SEEM LIKE SOME 'LOWANCE OUGHT BY
GOOD RIGHTS TO BE MADE FOR THAT DON'T YOU THINK SO
WHY MATTER O' COURSE MATT WHAT YOU THINK I AIN'T SO POWERFUL GOOD
AT FIGGERS
NERVY IS
S'POSEN YOU SPEAK TO HER 'BOUT IT
OH THAT'S PERFEC' UNUSELESS PINK
I'M A' OFFICER O' THE LAW PINK
AN' THE LAW CONSIDER WOMEN WELL I MAY SAY THE LAW SHE DEAL 'ITH
MEN NOT WOMEN AN' SHE EXPECT HER OFFICERS TO UNDERSTAN' FIGGERS
AN' IF I HADN'T O' UNDERSTOOD FIGGERS MR
SANKS WOULDN'T OR DARSNT' TO
'P'INT ME HIS DEP'TY
ME 'N' YOU CAN FIX THEM TERMS
NOW SEE HERE
REG'LAR BO'D EATIN' BO'D I MEAN IS TEN DOLLARS AN' SLEEPIN' AND
SINGUIL MEALS IS 'CORDIN' TO THE FIGGERS YOU'VE SOT FOR 'EM

ABSENTEES ACCORDIN' TO TRANSION CUSTOMERS AN' SINGUIL MEALERS AN'
SLEEPERS
IS THAT FA'R ER IS IT NOT FA'R
MR
FLUKER TURNED HIS HEAD AND AFTER MAKING OR THINKING HE HAD MADE A
CALCULATION ANSWERED
THAT'S THAT SEEM FA'R MATT
CERT'NLY 'TIS PINK I KNOWED YOU'D SAY SO AN' YOU KNOW I'D NEVER
WISH TO BE NOTHIN' BUT FA'R 'ITH PEOPLE I LIKE LIKE I DO YOU AN' YOUR
WIFE
LET THAT BE THE UNDERSTANDIN' THEN BETWIX' US
AN' PINK LET

WORLD TO FIND OUT THAT A MAN NEVER MAKES NOTHIN' BY MAKIN' A BLOWIN'
HORN O' HIS BUSINESS

FROM TO DAY
IN COURSE I SHALL TALK UP FOR THE HOUSE WHENSOMEVER AND
WHARSOMEVER I GO OR STAY
YOU KNOW THAT
AN' AS FOR MY BED SAID MR
PIKE FINALLY WHENSOMEVER I AIN'T HERE BY BED TIME YOU WELCOME TO
PUT ANY TRANSION PERSON IN IT AN' ALSO AN' LIKEWISE WHEN TRANSION
CUSTOM IS PRESSIN' AND YOU CRAMPED FOR BEDDIN' I'M WILLIN' TO GIVE
IT UP FOR THE TIME BEIN' AN' RATHER'N YOU SHOULD BE CRAMPED TOO BAD
I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES SOMEWHARS ELSE EVEN IF I HAS TO TAKE A PALLET AT
THE HEAD O' THE STA'R STEPS
NERVY SAID MR
FLUKER TO HIS WIFE AFTERWARDS MATT PIKE'S A
SENSIBLER AN' A FRIENDLIER AN' A 'COMMODATINER FELLER'N I THOUGHT
THEN WITHOUT GIVING DETAILS OF THE CONTRACT HE MENTIONED MERELY THE
WILLINGNESS OF THEIR BOARDER TO RESIGN HIS BED ON OCCASIONS OF
PRESSING EMERGENCY
HE'S TALKED MIGHTY FINE TO ME AND MARANN ANSWERED MRS
FLUKER
WE'LL SEE HOW HE HOLDS OUT
ONE THING I DO NOT LIKE OF HIS DOIN' AN'
THAT'S THE TALKIN' 'BOUT SIM MARCHMAN TO MARANN AN' MAKIN' GAME O'
HIS COUNTRY WAYS AS HE CALL 'EM
SECH AS THAT AIN'T RIGHT
IT MAY BE AS WELL TO EXPLAIN JUST HERE THAT SIMEON MARCHMAN THE
PERSON JUST NAMED BY MRS
FLUKER A STOUT INDUSTRIOUS YOUNG FARMER
RESIDING WITH HIS PARENTS IN THE COUNTRY NEAR BY WHERE THE FLUKERS HAD
DWELT BEFORE REMOVING TO TOWN HAD BEEN EYING MARANN FOR A YEAR OR
TWO AND WAITING UPON HER FAST RIPENING WOMANHOOD WITH INTENTIONS
THAT HE BELIEVED TO BE HIDDEN IN HIS OWN BREAST THOUGH HE HAD TAKEN
LESS PAINS TO CONCEAL THEM FROM MARANN THAN FROM THE REST OF HIS
ACQUAINTANCE
NOT THAT HE HAD EVER TOLD HER OF THEM IN SO MANY WORDS
BUT OH I NEED NOT STOP HERE IN THE MIDST OF THIS NARRATION TO
EXPLAIN HOW SUCH INTENTIONS BECOME KNOWN OR AT LEAST STRONGLY
SUSPECTED BY GIRLS EVEN THOSE LESS BRIGHT THAN MARANN FLUKER
SIMEON
HAD NOT CORDIALLY INDORSED THE MOVEMENT INTO TOWN THOUGH OF COURSE
KNOWING IT WAS NONE OF HIS BUSINESS HE HAD NEVER SO MUCH AS HINTED
OPPOSITION
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED ALSO IF HE REFLECTED THAT THERE
MIGHT BE SOME SELFISHNESS IN HIS HOSTILITY OR AT LEAST THAT IT WAS
HEIGHTENED BY APPREHENSIONS PERSONAL TO HIMSELF
CONSIDERING THE WANT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE NEW TENANTS MATTERS WENT ON
REMARKABLY WELL
MRS
FLUKER ACCUSTOMED TO RISE FROM HER COUCH LONG
BEFORE THE LARK MANAGED TO THE SATISFACTION OF ALL REGULAR
BOARDERS SINGLE MEAL TAKERS AND TRANSIENT PEOPLE
MARANN WENT TO THE
VILLAGE SCHOOL HER MOTHER DRESSING HER THOUGH WITH PRUDENT ECONOMY
AS NEATLY AND ALMOST AS TASTEFULLY AS ANY OF HER SCHOOLMATES WHILE
AS TO STUDY DEPORTMENT AND GENERAL PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GIRL IN
THE WHOLE SCHOOL TO BEAT HER I DON'T CARE WHO SHE WAS
II
DURING A NOT INCONSIDERABLE PERIOD MR
FLUKER INDULGED THE HONORABLE
CONVICTION THAT AT LAST HE HAD FOUND THE VEIN IN WHICH HIS BEST
TALENTS LAY AND HE WAS HAPPY IN FORESIGHT OF THE PROSPERITY AND
FELICITY WHICH THAT DISCOVERY PROMISED TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
HIS
NATIVE ACTIVITY FOUND MANY MORE OBJECTS FOR ITS EXERTION THAN BEFORE
HE RODE OUT TO THE FARM NOT OFTEN BUT SOMETIMES AS A MATTER OF
DUTY AND WAS FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SAM WAS MANAGING BETTER THAN
COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN THE ABSENCE OF HIS OWN CONTINUOUS
GUIDANCE
IN TOWN HE WALKED ABOUT THE HOTEL ENTERTAINED THE GUESTS
CARVED AT THE MEALS HOVERED ABOUT THE STORES THE DOCTORS' OFFICES
THE WAGON AND BLACKSMITH SHOPS DISCUSSED MERCANTILE MEDICAL
MECHANICAL QUESTIONS WITH SPECIALISTS IN ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS
THROWING INTO THEM ALL MORE AND MORE OF POLITICS AS THE INTIMACY
BETWEEN HIM AND HIS PATRON AND CHIEF BOARDER INCREASED
NOW AS TO THAT PATRON AND CHIEF BOARDER
THE NEED OF EXTENDING HIS
ACQUAINTANCE SEEMED TO PRESS UPON MR
PIKE WITH EVER INCREASING
WEIGHT
HE WAS HERE AND THERE ALL OVER THE COUNTY AT THE
COUNTY SEAT AT THE COUNTY VILLAGES AT JUSTICES' COURTS AT
EXECUTORS' AND ADMINISTRATORS' SALES AT QUARTERLY AND PROTRACTED
RELIGIOUS MEETINGS AT BARBECUES OF EVERY DIMENSION ON HUNTING
EXCURSIONS AND FISHING FROLICS AT SOCIAL PARTIES IN ALL
NEIGHBORHOODS
IT GOT TO BE SAID OF MR
PIKE THAT A FREER ACCEPTOR OF
HOSPITABLE INVITATIONS OR A BETTER APPRECIATOR OF HOSPITABLE
INTENTIONS WAS NOT AND NEEDED NOT TO BE FOUND POSSIBLY IN THE WHOLE
STATE
NOR WAS THIS ADMIRABLE DEPORTMENT CONFINED TO THE COUNTY IN
WHICH HE HELD SO HIGH OFFICIAL POSITION
HE ATTENDED AMONG OTHER
OCCASIONS LESS PUBLIC THE SPRING SESSIONS OF THE SUPREME AND COUNTY
COURTS IN THE FOUR ADJOINING COUNTIES THE GUEST OF ACQUAINTANCE OLD
AND NEW OVER THERE
WHEN STARTING UPON SUCH TRAVELS HE WOULD
SOMETIMES BREAKFAST WITH HIS TRAVELING COMPANION IN THE VILLAGE AND
IF SOMEWHAT BELATED IN THE RETURN SUP WITH HIM ALSO
YET WHEN AT FLUKERS' NO MAN COULD HAVE BEEN A MORE CHEERFUL AND
OTHERWISE SATISFACTORY BOARDER THAN MR
MATT PIKE
HE PRAISED EVERY
DISH SET BEFORE HIM BRAGGED TO THEIR VERY FACES OF HIS HOST AND
HOSTESS AND IN SPITE OF HIS ABSENCES WAS THE OFTENEST TO SIT AND CHAT
WITH MARANN WHEN HER MOTHER WOULD LET HER GO INTO THE PARLOR
HERE AND
EVERYWHERE ABOUT THE HOUSE IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE PASSAGE AT THE
FOOT OF THE STAIRS HE WOULD JOKE WITH MARANN ABOUT HER COUNTRY BEAU
AS HE STYLED POOR SIM MARCHMAN AND HE WOULD TALK AS THOUGH HE WAS
RATHER ASHAMED OF SIM AND WANTED MARANN TO STRING HER BOW FOR HIGHER
GAME
BRER SAM DID MANAGE WELL NOT ONLY THE FIELDS BUT THE YARD
EVERY
SATURDAY OF THE WORLD HE SENT IN SOMETHING OR OTHER TO HIS SISTER
I
DON'T KNOW WHETHER I OUGHT TO TELL IT OR NOT BUT FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT
IS DUE TO PURE VERACITY I WILL
ON AS MANY AS THREE DIFFERENT
OCCASIONS SIM MARCHMAN AS IF HE HAD LOST ALL SELF RESPECT OR HAD NOT
A PARTICLE OF TACT BROUGHT IN HIMSELF INSTEAD OF SENDING BY A NEGRO
A BUCKET OF BUTTER AND A COOP OF SPRING CHICKENS AS A FREE GIFT TO
MRS
FLUKER
I DO THINK ON MY SOUL THAT MR
MATT PIKE WAS MUCH
AMUSED BY SUCH DEGRADATION HOWEVER HE MUST SAY THAT THEY WERE ALL
FIRST RATE
AS FOR MARANN SHE WAS VERY SORRY FOR SIM AND WISHED HE
HAD NOT BROUGHT THESE GOOD THINGS AT ALL
NOBODY KNEW HOW IT CAME ABOUT BUT WHEN THE FLUKERS HAD BEEN IN TOWN
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND THREE MONTHS SIM MARCHMAN WHO TO USE HIS
OWN WORDS HAD NEVER BOTHERED HER A GREAT DEAL WITH HIS VISITS BEGAN
TO SUSPECT THAT WHAT FEW HE MADE WERE RECEIVED BY MARANN LATELY WITH
LESS CORDIALITY THAN BEFORE AND SO ONE DAY KNOWING NO BETTER IN HIS
AWKWARD STRAIGHTFORWARD COUNTRY MANNERS HE WANTED TO KNOW THE REASON
WHY
THEN MARANN GREW DISTANT AND ASKED SIM THE FOLLOWING QUESTION
YOU KNOW WHERE MR
PIKE'S GONE MR
MARCHMAN
NOW THE FACT WAS AND SHE KNEW IT THAT MARANN FLUKER HAD NEVER
BEFORE NOT SINCE SHE WAS BORN ADDRESSED THAT BOY AS MISTER
THE VISITOR'S FACE REDDENED AND REDDENED
NO HE FALTERED IN ANSWER NO NO MA'AM I SHOULD SAY
I I
DON'T KNOW WHERE MR
PIKE'S GONE
THEN HE LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS HAT DISCOVERED IT IN TIME TOOK IT INTO
HIS HANDS TURNED IT AROUND TWO OR THREE TIMES THEN BIDDING GOOD BYE
WITHOUT SHAKING HANDS TOOK HIMSELF OFF
MRS
FLUKER LIKED ALL THE MARCHMANS AND SHE WAS TROUBLED SOMEWHAT
WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE QUICKNESS AND MANNER OF SIM'S DEPARTURE FOR HE
HAD BEEN FULLY EXPECTED BY HER TO STAY TO DINNER
SAY HE DIDN'T EVEN SHAKE HANDS MARANN WHAT FOR WHAT YOU DO TO
HIM
NOT ONE BLESSED THING MA ONLY HE WANTED TO KNOW WHY I WASN'T
GLADDER TO SEE HIM THEN MARANN LOOKED INDIGNANT
SAY THEM WORDS MARANN
NO BUT HE HINTED 'EM
WHAT DID YOU SAY THEN
I JUST ASKED A MEANING NOTHING IN THE WIDE WORLD MA I ASKED HIM IF
HE KNEW WHERE MR
PIKE HAD GONE
AND THAT WERE ANSWER ENOUGH TO HURT HIS FEELIN'S
WHAT YOU WANT TO
KNOW WHERE MATT PIKE'S GONE FOR MARANN
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT KNOWING MA BUT I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY SIM
TALKED
LOOK HERE MARANN
LOOK STRAIGHT AT ME
YOU'LL BE MIGHTY FUR OFF YOUR
FEET IF YOU LET MATT PIKE PUT THINGS IN YOUR HEAD THAT HAIN'T NO
BUSINESS A BEIN' THERE AND SPECIAL IF YOU FIND YOURSELF A WANTIN' TO
KNOW WHERE HE'S A PERAMBULATIN' IN HIS EVERLASTIN' MEANDERIN'S
NOT A
CENT HAS HE PAID FOR HIS BOARD AND WHICH YOUR PA SAY HE HAVE A'
UNDERSTANDIN' WITH HIM ABOUT ALLOWIN' FOR HIS ABSENTEES WHICH IS ALL
RIGHT ENOUGH BUT WHICH IT'S NOW GOIN' ON TO THREE MONT'S AND WHAT IS
COMIN' TO US I NEED AND I WANT
HE OUGHT YOUR PA OUGHT TO LET ME
BARGAIN WITH MATT PIKE BECAUSE HE KNOW HE DON'T UNDERSTAN' FIGGERS
LIKE MATT PIKE
HE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE BARGAIN WERE FOR I'VE
ASKED HIM AND HE ALWAYS BEGINS WITH A MULTIPLYIN' OF WORDS AND NEVER
ANSWERS ME
ON HIS NEXT RETURN FROM HIS TRAVELS MR
PIKE NOTICED A COLDNESS IN
MRS
FLUKER'S MANNER AND THIS ENHANCED HIS PRAISE OF THE HOUSE
THE
LAST WEEK OF THE THIRD MONTH CAME
MR
PIKE WAS OFTEN NOTICED BEFORE
AND AFTER MEALS STANDING AT THE DESK IN THE HOTEL OFFICE CALLED IN
THOSE TIMES THE BAR ROOM ENGAGED IN MAKING CALCULATIONS
THE DAY
BEFORE THE CONTRACT EXPIRED MRS
FLUKER WHO HAD NOT INDULGED HERSELF
WITH A SINGLE HOLIDAY SINCE THEY HAD BEEN IN TOWN LEFT MARANN IN
CHARGE OF THE HOUSE AND RODE FORTH SPENDING PART OF THE DAY WITH
MRS
MARCHMAN SIM'S MOTHER
ALL WERE GLAD TO SEE HER OF COURSE AND
SHE RETURNED SMARTLY FRESHENED BY THE VISIT
THAT NIGHT SHE HAD A
TALK WITH MARANN AND OH HOW MARANN DID CRY
THE VERY LAST DAY CAME
LIKE INSURANCE POLICIES THE CONTRACT WAS TO
EXPIRE AT A CERTAIN HOUR
SIM MARCHMAN CAME JUST BEFORE DINNER TO
WHICH HE WAS SENT FOR BY MRS
FLUKER WHO HAD SEEN HIM AS HE RODE INTO
TOWN
HELLO SIM SAID MR
PIKE AS HE TOOK HIS SEAT OPPOSITE HIM
YOU

JEST MOD'RATE MR

LONG
SEE YOU ARFTER AMEJIANT SIM
NEVER HAD THE DEPUTY BEEN MORE GRACIOUS AND WITTY
HE TALKED AND
TALKED OUTTALKING EVEN MR
FLUKER HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN TOWN WHO
COULD DO THAT
HE WINKED AT MARANN AS HE PUT QUESTIONS TO SIM SOME OF
THE WORDS EMPLOYED IN WHICH SIM HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE
YET SIM HELD
UP AS WELL AS HE COULD AND AFTER DINNER FOLLOWED MARANN WITH SOME
LITTLE DIGNITY INTO THE PARLOR
THEY HAD NOT BEEN THERE MORE THAN TEN
MINUTES WHEN MRS
FLUKER WAS HEARD TO WALK RAPIDLY ALONG THE PASSAGE
LEADING FROM THE DINING ROOM TO ENTER HER OWN CHAMBER FOR ONLY A
MOMENT THEN TO COME OUT AND RUSH TO THE PARLOR DOOR WITH THE GIG WHIP
IN HER HAND
SUCH UNCOMMON CONDUCT IN A WOMAN LIKE MRS
PINK FLUKER OF
COURSE NEEDS EXPLANATION
WHEN ALL THE OTHER BOARDERS HAD LEFT THE HOUSE THE DEPUTY AND MR
FLUKER HAVING REPAIRED TO THE BAR ROOM THE FORMER SAID
NOW PINK FOR OUR SETTLEMENT AS YOU SAY YOUR WIFE THINK WE BETTER
HAVE ONE
I'D 'A' BEEN WILLIN' TO LET ACCOUNTS KEEP ON A RUNNIN'

FOLLER PINK AN' IF YOU KETCH ME IN
ANY MISTAKES IN THE KYARIN' AN' ADDIN' P'INT IT OUT

RATHER'N HAVE YOU TOO BAD CRAMPED I RIS TO MAKE WAY FOR TWO OF 'EM
YIT AS I HAD ONE GOOD NAP I DIDN'T THINK I OUGHT TO PUT THAT DOWN BUT

THEM MAKES FIVE DOLLARS HALF AN' SEB'N PENCE AN' WHICH
KYAR'D ON TO THE T'OTHER TWENTY SIX AN' A HALF FETCHES THE WHOLE
CABOOL TO JES' THIRTY TWO DOLLARS AN' SEB'N PENCE
BUT I MADE UP MY
MIND I'D FLING OUT THAT SEB'N PENCE AN' JES' CALL IT A DOLLAR EVEN
MONEY AN' WHICH HERE'S THE SOLID SILVER
IN SPITE OF THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THIS ENUMERATION OF
COUNTER CHARGES WAS MADE MR
FLUKER COMMENCED PERSPIRING AT THE FIRST
ITEM AND WHEN THE BALANCE WAS ANNOUNCED HIS FACE WAS COVERED WITH
HUGE DROPS
IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT MRS
FLUKER WHO WELL KNOWING HER
HUSBAND'S UNFAMILIARITY WITH COMPLICATED ACCOUNTS HAD FELT HER DUTY
TO BE LISTENING NEAR THE BAR ROOM DOOR LEFT AND QUICKLY AFTERWARDS
APPEARED BEFORE MARANN AND SIM AS I HAVE REPRESENTED
YOU THINK MATT PIKE AIN'T TRYIN' TO SETTLE WITH YOUR PA WITH A
DOLLAR I'M GOIN' TO MAKE HIM KEEP HIS DOLLAR AN' I'M GOIN' TO GIVE
HIM SOMETHIN' TO GO 'LONG WITH IT
THE GOOD LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US EXCLAIMED MARANN SPRINGING UP AND
CATCHING HOLD OF HER MOTHER'S SKIRTS AS SHE BEGAN HER ADVANCE TOWARDS
THE BAR ROOM
OH MA FOR THE LORD'S SAKE SIM SIM SIM IF YOU
CARE ANY THING FOR ME IN THIS WIDE WORLD DON'T LET MA GO INTO THAT
ROOM
MISSIS FLUKER SAID SIM RISING INSTANTLY WAIT JEST TWO MINUTES
TILL I SEE MR
PIKE ON SOME PRESSIN' BUSINESS I WON'T KEEP YOU OVER
TWO MINUTES A WAITIN'
HE TOOK HER SET HER DOWN IN A CHAIR TREMBLING LOOKED AT HER A MOMENT
AS SHE BEGAN TO WEEP THEN GOING OUT AND CLOSING THE DOOR STRODE
RAPIDLY TO THE BAR ROOM
LET ME HELP YOU SETTLE YOUR BOARD BILL MR
PIKE BY PAYIN' YOU A
LITTLE ONE I OWE YOU
DOUBLING HIS FIST HE STRUCK OUT WITH A BLOW THAT FELLED THE DEPUTY TO
THE FLOOR
THEN CATCHING HIM BY HIS HEELS HE DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE
HOUSE INTO THE STREET
LIFTING HIS FOOT ABOVE HIS FACE HE SAID
YOU STIR TILL I TELL YOU AN' I'LL STOMP YOUR NOSE DOWN EVEN WITH THE
BALANCE OF YOUR MEAN FACE
'TAIN'T EXACTLY MY BUSINESS HOW YOU CHEATED
MR
FLUKER THOUGH 'PON MY SOUL I NEVER KNOWED A TRIFLINER
LOWDOWNER TRICK
BUT I OWED YOU MYSELF FOR YOUR TALKIN' 'BOUT AND
YOUR LYIN' 'BOUT ME AND NOW I'VE PAID YOU AN' EF YOU ONLY KNOWED IT
I'VE SAVED YOU FROM A GIG WHIPPIN'
NOW YOU MAY GIT UP
HERE'S HIS DOLLAR SIM SAID MR
FLUKER THROWING IT OUT OF THE
WINDOW
NERVY SAY MAKE HIM TAKE IT
THE VANQUISHED NOT DARING TO REFUSE POCKETED THE COIN AND SLUNK
AWAY AMID THE JEERS OF A SCORE OF VILLAGERS WHO HAD BEEN DRAWN TO THE
SCENE
IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY THE LATE OMISSION OF THE SHAKING OF SIM'S AND
MARANN'S HANDS WAS COMPENSATED AT THEIR PARTING THAT AFTERNOON
I AM
MORE CONFIDENT ON THIS POINT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE YEAR THOSE
HANDS WERE JOINED INSEPARABLY BY THE PREACHER
BUT THIS WAS WHEN THEY
HAD ALL GONE BACK TO THEIR OLD HOME FOR IF MR
FLUKER DID NOT BECOME
FULLY CONVINCED THAT HIS MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION WAS NOT ADVANCED QUITE
ENOUGH FOR ALL THE EXIGENCIES OF HOTEL KEEPING HIS WIFE DECLARED THAT
SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND THAT SHE AND MARANN WERE GOING HOME
MR
FLUKER MAY BE SAID THEREFORE TO HAVE FOLLOWED RATHER THAN LED HIS
FAMILY ON THE RETURN
AS FOR THE DEPUTY FINDING THAT IF HE DID NOT LEAVE IT VOLUNTARILY HE
WOULD BE DRUMMED OUT OF THE VILLAGE HE DEPARTED WHITHER I DO NOT
REMEMBER IF ANYBODY EVER KNEW

THEY CERTAINLY ARE NICE PEOPLE I ASSENTED TO MY WIFE'S OBSERVATION
USING THE COLLOQUIAL PHRASE WITH A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT WAS ANYTHING
BUT NICE ENGLISH AND I'LL BET THAT THEIR THREE CHILDREN ARE BETTER
BROUGHT UP THAN MOST OF
TWO CHILDREN CORRECTED MY WIFE
THREE HE TOLD ME

HE SAID THREE
YOU'VE SIMPLY FORGOTTEN
I'M SURE SHE TOLD ME THEY HAD ONLY TWO A
BOY AND A GIRL
WELL I DIDN'T ENTER INTO PARTICULARS

NEAR SIGHTED MAN LEARNS BY ENFORCED OBSERVATION TO RECOGNIZE PERSONS
AT A DISTANCE WHEN THE FACE IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE NORMAL EYE SO THE
MAN WITH A BAD MEMORY LEARNS ALMOST UNCONSCIOUSLY TO LISTEN
CAREFULLY AND REPORT ACCURATELY
MY MEMORY IS BAD BUT I HAD NOT HAD
TIME TO FORGET THAT MR
BREWSTER BREDE HAD TOLD ME THAT AFTERNOON THAT
HE HAD THREE CHILDREN AT PRESENT LEFT IN THE CARE OF HIS
MOTHER IN LAW WHILE HE AND MRS
BREDE TOOK THEIR SUMMER VACATION
TWO CHILDREN REPEATED MY WIFE AND THEY ARE STAYING WITH HIS AUNT
JENNY
HE TOLD ME WITH HIS MOTHER IN LAW I PUT IN
MY WIFE LOOKED AT ME
WITH A SERIOUS EXPRESSION
MEN MAY NOT REMEMBER MUCH OF WHAT THEY ARE
TOLD ABOUT CHILDREN BUT ANY MAN KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN AUNT
AND A MOTHER IN LAW
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE ASKED MY WIFE
OH CERTAINLY I REPLIED
ONLY THEY SEEM TO BE A LITTLE MIXED UP
ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN
THAT ISN'T A NICE THING TO SAY RETURNED MY WIFE
I COULD NOT DENY
IT
AND YET THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE BREDES CAME DOWN AND SEATED
THEMSELVES OPPOSITE US AT TABLE BEAMING AND SMILING IN THEIR NATURAL
PLEASANT WELL BRED FASHION I KNEW TO A SOCIAL CERTAINTY THAT THEY
WERE NICE PEOPLE
HE WAS A FINE LOOKING FELLOW IN HIS NEAT
TENNIS FLANNELS SLIM GRACEFUL TWENTY EIGHT OR THIRTY YEARS OLD
WITH A FRENCHY POINTED BEARD
SHE WAS NICE IN ALL HER PRETTY
CLOTHES AND SHE HERSELF WAS PRETTY WITH THAT TYPE OF PRETTINESS WHICH
OUTWEARS MOST OTHER TYPES THE PRETTINESS THAT LIES IN A ROUNDED
FIGURE A DUSKY SKIN PLUMP ROSY CHEEKS WHITE TEETH AND BLACK EYES
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWENTY FIVE YOU GUESSED THAT SHE WAS PRETTIER
THAN SHE WAS AT TWENTY AND THAT SHE WOULD BE PRETTIER STILL AT FORTY
AND NICE PEOPLE WERE ALL WE WANTED TO MAKE US HAPPY IN MR
JACOBUS'S
SUMMER BOARDING HOUSE ON TOP OF ORANGE MOUNTAIN
FOR A WEEK WE HAD
COME DOWN TO BREAKFAST EACH MORNING WONDERING WHY WE WASTED THE
PRECIOUS DAYS OF IDLENESS WITH THE COMPANY GATHERED AROUND THE JACOBUS
BOARD
WHAT JOY OF HUMAN COMPANIONSHIP WAS TO BE HAD OUT OF MRS
TABB
AND MISS HOOGENCAMP THE TWO MIDDLE AGED GOSSIPS FROM SCRANTON
PA OUT OF MR
AND MRS
BIGGLE AN INDURATED HEAD BOOKKEEPER AND HIS
PRIM AND CENSORIOUS WIFE OUT OF OLD MAJOR HALKIT A RETIRED BUSINESS
MAN WHO HAVING ONCE SOLD A FEW SHARES ON COMMISSION WROTE FOR
CIRCULARS OF EVERY STOCK COMPANY THAT WAS STARTED AND TRIED TO INDUCE
EVERY ONE TO INVEST WHO WOULD LISTEN TO HIM WE LOOKED AROUND AT THOSE
DULL FACES THE TRUTHFUL INDICES OF MEAN AND BARREN MINDS AND DECIDED
THAT WE WOULD LEAVE THAT MORNING
THEN WE ATE MRS
JACOBUS'S BISCUIT
LIGHT AS AURORA'S CLOUDLETS DRANK HER HONEST COFFEE INHALED THE
PERFUME OF THE LATE AZALEAS WITH WHICH SHE DECKED HER TABLE AND
DECIDED TO POSTPONE OUR DEPARTURE ONE MORE DAY
AND THEN WE WANDERED
OUT TO TAKE OUR MORNING GLANCE AT WHAT WE CALLED OUR VIEW AND IT
SEEMED TO US AS IF TABB AND HOOGENCAMP AND HALKIT AND THE BIGGLESES
COULD NOT DRIVE US AWAY IN A YEAR
I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN AFTER BREAKFAST MY WIFE INVITED THE BREDES
TO WALK WITH US TO OUR VIEW THE HOOGENCAMP BIGGLE TABB HALKIT
CONTINGENT NEVER STIRRED OFF JACOBUS'S VERANDA BUT WE BOTH FELT THAT
THE BREDES WOULD NOT PROFANE THAT SACRED SCENE
WE STROLLED SLOWLY
ACROSS THE FIELDS PASSED THROUGH THE LITTLE BELT OF WOODS AND AS I
HEARD MRS
BREDE'S LITTLE CRY OF STARTLED RAPTURE I MOTIONED TO BREDE
TO LOOK UP
BY JOVE HE CRIED HEAVENLY
WE LOOKED OFF FROM THE BROW OF THE MOUNTAIN OVER FIFTEEN MILES OF
BILLOWING GREEN TO WHERE FAR ACROSS A FAR STRETCH OF PALE BLUE LAY A
DIM PURPLE LINE THAT WE KNEW WAS STATEN ISLAND
TOWNS AND VILLAGES LAY
BEFORE US AND UNDER US THERE WERE RIDGES AND HILLS UPLANDS AND
LOWLANDS WOODS AND PLAINS ALL MASSED AND MINGLED IN THAT GREAT
SILENT SEA OF SUNLIT GREEN
FOR SILENT IT WAS TO US STANDING IN THE
SILENCE OF A HIGH PLACE SILENT WITH A SUNDAY STILLNESS THAT MADE US
LISTEN WITHOUT TAKING THOUGHT FOR THE SOUND OF BELLS COMING UP FROM
THE SPIRES THAT ROSE ABOVE THE TREE TOPS THE TREE TOPS THAT LAY AS
FAR BENEATH US AS THE LIGHT CLOUDS WERE ABOVE US THAT DROPPED GREAT
SHADOWS UPON OUR HEADS AND FAINT SPECKS OF SHADE UPON THE BROAD SWEEP
OF LAND AT THE MOUNTAIN'S FOOT
AND SO THAT IS YOUR VIEW ASKED MRS
BREDE AFTER A MOMENT YOU
ARE VERY GENEROUS TO MAKE IT OURS TOO
THEN WE LAY DOWN ON THE GRASS AND BREDE BEGAN TO TALK IN A GENTLE
VOICE AS IF HE FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE PLACE
HE HAD PADDLED A
CANOE IN HIS EARLIER DAYS HE SAID AND HE KNEW EVERY RIVER AND CREEK
IN THAT VAST STRETCH OF LANDSCAPE
HE FOUND HIS LANDMARKS AND POINTED
OUT TO US WHERE THE PASSAIC AND THE HACKENSACK FLOWED INVISIBLE TO
US HIDDEN BEHIND GREAT RIDGES THAT IN OUR SIGHT WERE BUT COMBINGS OF
THE GREEN WAVES UPON WHICH WE LOOKED DOWN
AND YET ON THE FURTHER
SIDE OF THOSE BROAD RIDGES AND RISES WERE SCORES OF VILLAGES A LITTLE
WORLD OF COUNTRY LIFE LYING UNSEEN UNDER OUR EYES
A GOOD DEAL LIKE LOOKING AT HUMANITY HE SAID THERE IS SUCH A
THING AS GETTING SO FAR ABOVE OUR FELLOW MEN THAT WE SEE ONLY ONE SIDE
OF THEM
AH HOW MUCH BETTER WAS THIS SORT OF TALK THAN THE CHATTER AND GOSSIP
OF THE TABB AND THE HOOGENCAMP THAN THE MAJOR'S DISSERTATIONS UPON
HIS EVERLASTING CIRCULARS MY WIFE AND I EXCHANGED GLANCES
NOW WHEN I WENT UP THE MATTERHORN MR
BREDE BEGAN
WHY DEAR INTERRUPTED HIS WIFE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU EVER WENT UP THE
MATTERHORN
IT IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO SAID MR
BREDE HURRIEDLY
I I DIDN'T
TELL YOU WHEN I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU KNOW IT WAS RATHER
DANGEROUS WELL AS I WAS SAYING IT LOOKED OH IT DIDN'T LOOK AT ALL
LIKE THIS
A CLOUD FLOATED OVERHEAD THROWING ITS GREAT SHADOW OVER THE FIELD
WHERE WE LAY
THE SHADOW PASSED OVER THE MOUNTAIN'S BROW AND
REAPPEARED FAR BELOW A RAPIDLY DECREASING BLOT FLYING EASTWARD OVER
THE GOLDEN GREEN
MY WIFE AND I EXCHANGED GLANCES ONCE MORE
SOMEHOW THE SHADOW LINGERED OVER US ALL
AS WE WENT HOME THE BREDES
WENT SIDE BY SIDE ALONG THE NARROW PATH AND MY WIFE AND I WALKED
TOGETHER
SHOULD YOU THINK SHE ASKED ME THAT A MAN WOULD CLIMB THE
MATTERHORN THE VERY FIRST YEAR HE WAS MARRIED
I DON'T KNOW MY DEAR I ANSWERED EVASIVELY THIS ISN'T THE FIRST
YEAR I HAVE BEEN MARRIED NOT BY A GOOD MANY AND I WOULDN'T CLIMB
IT FOR A FARM
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN SHE SAID
I DID
WHEN WE REACHED THE BOARDING HOUSE MR
JACOBUS TOOK ME ASIDE
YOU KNOW HE BEGAN HIS DISCOURSE MY WIFE SHE USET TO LIVE IN N'
YORK
I DIDN'T KNOW BUT I SAID YES
SHE SAYS THE NUMBERS ON THE STREETS RUNS CRISS CROSS LIKE
THIRTY FOUR'S ON ONE SIDE O' THE STREET AN' THIRTY FIVE ON T'OTHER
HOW'S THAT
THAT IS THE INVARIABLE RULE I BELIEVE
THEN I SAY THESE HERE NEW FOLK THAT YOU 'N' YOUR WIFE SEEM SO
MIGHTY TAKEN UP WITH D'YE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 'EM
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF YOUR BOARDERS MR
JACOBUS I
REPLIED CONSCIOUS OF SOME IRRITABILITY
IF I CHOOSE TO ASSOCIATE
WITH ANY OF THEM
JESS SO JESS SO BROKE IN JACOBUS
I HAIN'T NOTHIN' TO SAY AG'INST
YER SOSHERBIL'TY
BUT DO YE KNOW THEM
WHY CERTAINLY NOT I REPLIED
WELL THAT WAS ALL I WUZ ASKIN' YE
YE SEE WHEN HE COME HERE TO
TAKE THE ROOMS YOU WASN'T HERE THEN HE TOLD MY WIFE THAT HE LIVED AT
NUMBER THIRTY FOUR IN HIS STREET
AN' YISTIDDY SHE TOLD HER THAT
THEY LIVED AT NUMBER THIRTY FIVE
HE SAID HE LIVED IN AN
APARTMENT HOUSE
NOW THERE CAN'T BE NO APARTMENT HOUSE ON TWO SIDES OF
THE SAME STREET KIN THEY
WHAT STREET WAS IT I INQUIRED WEARILY
HUNDRED 'N' TWENTY FIRST STREET
MAY BE I REPLIED STILL MORE WEARILY
THAT'S HARLEM
NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO IN HARLEM
I WENT UP TO MY WIFE'S ROOM
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S QUEER SHE ASKED ME
I THINK I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH THAT YOUNG MAN TO NIGHT I SAID AND
SEE IF HE CAN GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF
BUT MY DEAR MY WIFE SAID GRAVELY SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHETHER
THEY'VE HAD THE MEASLES OR NOT
WHY GREAT SCOTT I EXCLAIMED THEY MUST HAVE HAD THEM WHEN THEY
WERE CHILDREN
PLEASE DON'T BE STUPID SAID MY WIFE
I MEANT THEIR CHILDREN
AFTER DINNER THAT NIGHT OR RATHER AFTER SUPPER FOR WE HAD DINNER IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY AT JACOBUS'S I WALKED DOWN THE LONG VERANDAH TO
ASK BREDE WHO WAS PLACIDLY SMOKING AT THE OTHER END TO ACCOMPANY ME
ON A TWILIGHT STROLL
HALF WAY DOWN I MET MAJOR HALKIT
THAT FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAID INDICATING THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE AT
THE FURTHER END OF THE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE A QUEER SORT OF A DICK
HE
TOLD ME THAT HE WAS OUT OF BUSINESS AND JUST LOOKING ROUND FOR A
CHANCE TO INVEST HIS CAPITAL
AND I'VE BEEN TELLING HIM WHAT AN
EVERLASTING BIG SHOW HE HAD TO TAKE STOCK IN THE CAPITOLINE TRUST
COMPANY STARTS NEXT MONTH FOUR MILLION CAPITAL I TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT
IT
'OH WELL HE SAYS 'LET'S WAIT AND THINK ABOUT IT 'WAIT SAYS
I 'THE CAPITOLINE TRUST COMPANY WON'T WAIT FOR YOU MY BOY
THIS IS
LETTING YOU IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR SAYS I 'AND IT'S NOW OR NEVER
'OH LET IT WAIT SAYS HE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN TO THE MAN
I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL HE KNOWS HIS OWN BUSINESS MAJOR I SAID AS I
STARTED AGAIN FOR BREDE'S END OF THE VERANDA
BUT I WAS TROUBLED NONE
THE LESS
THE MAJOR COULD NOT HAVE INFLUENCED THE SALE OF ONE SHARE OF
STOCK IN THE CAPITOLINE COMPANY
BUT THAT STOCK WAS A GREAT
INVESTMENT A RARE CHANCE FOR A PURCHASER WITH A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS
PERHAPS IT WAS NO MORE REMARKABLE THAT BREDE SHOULD NOT INVEST THAN
THAT I SHOULD NOT AND YET IT SEEMED TO ADD ONE CIRCUMSTANCE MORE TO
THE OTHER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES
WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS THAT EVENING I FOUND MY WIFE PUTTING HER HAIR TO
BED I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN BETTER DESCRIBE AN OPERATION FAMILIAR TO
EVERY MARRIED MAN
I WAITED UNTIL THE LAST TRESS WAS COILED UP AND
THEN I SPOKE
I'VE TALKED WITH BREDE I SAID AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO CATECHIZE HIM
HE SEEMED TO FEEL THAT SOME SORT OF EXPLANATION WAS LOOKED FOR AND HE
WAS VERY OUTSPOKEN
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE CHILDREN THAT IS I MUST
HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD HIM
THERE ARE ONLY TWO
BUT THE MATTERHORN EPISODE
WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH
HE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS UNTIL HE HAD
GOT SO FAR INTO IT THAT HE COULDN'T BACK OUT AND HE DIDN'T TELL HER
BECAUSE HE'D LEFT HER HERE YOU SEE AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
LEFT HER HERE CRIED MY WIFE
I'VE BEEN SITTING WITH HER THE WHOLE
AFTERNOON SEWING AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HE LEFT HER AT GENEVA AND
CAME BACK AND TOOK HER TO BASLE AND THE BABY WAS BORN THERE NOW I'M
SURE DEAR BECAUSE I ASKED HER
PERHAPS I WAS MISTAKEN WHEN I THOUGHT HE SAID SHE WAS ON THIS SIDE OF
THE WATER I SUGGESTED WITH BITTER BITING IRONY
YOU POOR DEAR DID I ABUSE YOU SAID MY WIFE
BUT DO YOU KNOW
MRS
TABB SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY LUMPS OF SUGAR HE TOOK
IN HIS COFFEE
NOW THAT SEEMS QUEER DOESN'T IT
IT DID
IT WAS A SMALL THING
BUT IT LOOKED QUEER VERY QUEER
THE NEXT MORNING IT WAS CLEAR THAT WAR WAS DECLARED AGAINST THE
BREDES
THEY CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST SOMEWHAT LATE AND AS SOON AS
THEY ARRIVED THE BIGGLESES SWOOPED UP THE LAST FRAGMENTS THAT
REMAINED ON THEIR PLATES AND MADE A STATELY MARCH OUT OF THE
DINING ROOM THEN MISS HOOGENCAMP AROSE AND DEPARTED LEAVING A WHOLE
FISH BALL ON HER PLATE
EVEN AS ATALANTA MIGHT HAVE DROPPED AN APPLE
BEHIND HER TO TEMPT HER PURSUER TO CHECK HIS SPEED SO MISS HOOGENCAMP
LEFT THAT FISH BALL BEHIND HER AND BETWEEN HER MAIDEN SELF AND
CONTAMINATION
WE HAD FINISHED OUR BREAKFAST MY WIFE AND I BEFORE THE BREDES
APPEARED
WE TALKED IT OVER AND AGREED THAT WE WERE GLAD THAT WE HAD
NOT BEEN OBLIGED TO TAKE SIDES UPON SUCH INSUFFICIENT TESTIMONY
AFTER BREAKFAST IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE MALE HALF OF THE JACOBUS
HOUSEHOLD TO GO AROUND THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING AND SMOKE THEIR
PIPES AND CIGARS WHERE THEY WOULD NOT ANNOY THE LADIES
WE SAT UNDER A
TRELLIS COVERED WITH A GRAPEVINE THAT HAD BORNE NO GRAPES IN THE
MEMORY OF MAN
THIS VINE HOWEVER BORE LEAVES AND THESE ON THAT
PLEASANT SUMMER MORNING SHIELDED FROM US TWO PERSONS WHO WERE IN
EARNEST CONVERSATION IN THE STRAGGLING HALF DEAD FLOWER GARDEN AT THE
SIDE OF THE HOUSE
I DON'T WANT WE HEARD MR
JACOBUS SAY TO ENTER IN NO MAN'S
PRY VACY BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW WHO IT MAY BE LIKE THAT I HEV IN
MY HOUSE
NOW WHAT I ASK OF YOU AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO TAKE IT AS
IN NO WAYS PERSONAL IS HEV YOU YOUR MERRIDGE LICENSE WITH YOU
NO WE HEARD THE VOICE OF MR
BREDE REPLY
HAVE YOU YOURS
I THINK IT WAS A CHANCE SHOT BUT IT TOLD ALL THE SAME
THE MAJOR HE
WAS A WIDOWER AND MR
BIGGLE AND I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND MR
JACOBUS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GRAPE TRELLIS LOOKED AT I DON'T
KNOW WHAT AND WAS AS SILENT AS WE WERE
WHERE IS YOUR MARRIAGE LICENSE MARRIED READER DO YOU KNOW FOUR
MEN NOT INCLUDING MR
BREDE STOOD OR SAT ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER OF
THAT GRAPE TRELLIS AND NOT ONE OF THEM KNEW WHERE HIS
MARRIAGE LICENSE WAS
EACH OF US HAD HAD ONE THE MAJOR HAD HAD THREE
BUT WHERE WERE THEY WHERE IS YOURS TUCKED IN YOUR BEST MAN'S
POCKET DEPOSITED IN HIS DESK OR WASHED TO A PULP IN HIS WHITE
WAISTCOAT IF WHITE WAISTCOATS BE THE FASHION OF THE HOUR WASHED OUT
OF EXISTENCE CAN YOU TELL WHERE IT IS CAN YOU UNLESS YOU ARE ONE OF
THOSE PEOPLE WHO FRAME THAT INTERESTING DOCUMENT AND HANG IT UPON
THEIR DRAWING ROOM WALLS
MR
BREDE'S VOICE AROSE AFTER AN AWFUL STILLNESS OF WHAT SEEMED LIKE
FIVE MINUTES AND WAS PROBABLY THIRTY SECONDS
MR
JACOBUS WILL YOU MAKE OUT YOUR BILL AT ONCE AND LET ME PAY IT
I SHALL LEAVE BY THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN
AND WILL YOU ALSO SEND THE
WAGON FOR MY TRUNKS
I HAIN'T SAID I WANTED TO HEV YE LEAVE BEGAN MR
JACOBUS BUT
BREDE CUT HIM SHORT
BRING ME YOUR BILL
BUT REMONSTRATED JACOBUS EF YE AIN'T
BRING ME YOUR BILL SAID MR
BREDE
MY WIFE AND I WENT OUT FOR OUR MORNING'S WALK
BUT IT SEEMED TO US
WHEN WE LOOKED AT OUR VIEW AS IF WE COULD ONLY SEE THOSE INVISIBLE
VILLAGES OF WHICH BREDE HAD TOLD US THAT OTHER SIDE OF THE RIDGES AND
RISES OF WHICH WE CATCH NO GLIMPSE FROM LOFTY HILLS OR FROM THE
HEIGHTS OF HUMAN SELF ESTEEM
WE MEANT TO STAY OUT UNTIL THE BREDES
HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE BUT WE RETURNED JUST IN TIME TO SEE PETE
THE JACOBUS DARKEY THE BLACKER OF BOOTS THE BRASHER OF COATS THE
GENERAL HANDY MAN OF THE HOUSE LOADING THE BREDE TRUNKS ON THE
JACOBUS WAGON
AND AS WE STEPPED UPON THE VERANDAH DOWN CAME MRS
BREDE LEANING ON
MR
BREDE'S ARM AS THOUGH SHE WERE ILL AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT SHE HAD
BEEN CRYING
THERE WERE HEAVY RINGS ABOUT HER PRETTY BLACK EYES
MY WIFE TOOK A STEP TOWARD HER
LOOK AT THAT DRESS DEAR SHE WHISPERED SHE NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING
LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN SHE PUT THAT ON
IT WAS A PRETTY DELICATE DAINTY DRESS A GRACEFUL NARROW STRIPED
AFFAIR
HER HAT WAS TRIMMED WITH A NARROW STRIPED SILK OF THE SAME
COLORS MAROON AND WHITE AND IN HER HAND SHE HELD A PARASOL THAT
MATCHED HER DRESS
SHE'S HAD A NEW DRESS ON TWICE A DAY SAID MY WIFE BUT THAT'S THE
PRETTIEST YET
OH SOMEHOW I'M AWFULLY SORRY THEY'RE GOING
BUT GOING THEY WERE
THEY MOVED TOWARD THE STEPS
MRS
BREDE LOOKED
TOWARD MY WIFE AND MY WIFE MOVED TOWARD MRS
BREDE
BUT THE
OSTRACIZED WOMAN AS THOUGH SHE FELT THE DEEP HUMILIATION OF HER
POSITION TURNED SHARPLY AWAY AND OPENED HER PARASOL TO SHIELD HER
EYES FROM THE SUN
A SHOWER OF RICE A HALF POUND SHOWER OF RICE FELL
DOWN OVER HER PRETTY HAT AND HER PRETTY DRESS AND FELL IN A
SPATTERING CIRCLE ON THE FLOOR OUTLINING HER SKIRTS AND THERE IT LAY
IN A BROAD UNEVEN BAND BRIGHT IN THE MORNING SUN
MRS
BREDE WAS IN MY WIFE'S ARMS SOBBING AS IF HER YOUNG HEART WOULD
BREAK
OH YOU POOR DEAR SILLY CHILDREN MY WIFE CRIED AS MRS
BREDE
SOBBED ON HER SHOULDER WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
W W W WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE T T TAKEN FOR A B B B B BRIDAL COUPLE
SOBBED MRS
BREDE AND WE D D DIDN'T DREAM WHAT AWFUL LIES WE'D
HAVE TO TELL AND ALL THE AW AWFUL MIXED UP NESS OF IT
OH DEAR
DEAR DEAR
PETE COMMANDED MR
JACOBUS PUT BACK THEM TRUNKS
THESE FOLKS
STAYS HERE'S LONG'S THEY WANTS TER
MR
BREDE HE HELD OUT A LARGE
HARD HAND I'D ORTER'VE KNOWN BETTER HE SAID
AND MY LAST DOUBT OF
MR
BREDE VANISHED AS HE SHOOK THAT GRIMY HAND IN MANLY FASHION
THE TWO WOMEN WERE WALKING OFF TOWARD OUR VIEW EACH WITH AN ARM
ABOUT THE OTHER'S WAIST TOUCHED BY A SUDDEN SISTERHOOD OF SYMPATHY
GENTLEMEN SAID MR
BREDE ADDRESSING JACOBUS BIGGLE THE MAJOR AND
ME THERE IS A HOSTELRY DOWN THE STREET WHERE THEY SELL HONEST NEW
JERSEY BEER
I RECOGNIZE THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SITUATION
WE FIVE MEN FILED DOWN THE STREET
THE TWO WOMEN WENT TOWARD THE
PLEASANT SLOPE WHERE THE SUNLIGHT GILDED THE FOREHEAD OF THE GREAT
HILL
ON MR
JACOBUS'S VERANDA LAY A SPATTERED CIRCLE OF SHINING
GRAINS OF RICE
TWO OF MR
JACOBUS'S PIGEONS FLEW DOWN AND PICKED UP
THE SHINING GRAINS MAKING GRATEFUL NOISES FAR DOWN IN THEIR THROATS
THE BULLER PODINGTON COMPACT
BY FRANK RICHARD STOCKTON 1834 1902
FROM SCRIBNER'S MAGAZINE AUGUST 1897
REPUBLISHED IN AFIELD AND
AFLOAT BY FRANK RICHARD STOCKTON COPYRIGHT 1900 BY CHARLES
SCRIBNER'S SONS
REPRINTED BY PERMISSION OF THE PUBLISHERS
I TELL YOU WILLIAM SAID THOMAS BULLER TO HIS FRIEND MR
PODINGTON
I AM TRULY SORRY ABOUT IT BUT I CANNOT ARRANGE FOR IT THIS YEAR
NOW AS TO MY INVITATION THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT
OF COURSE IT IS DIFFERENT WAS THE REPLY BUT I AM OBLIGED TO SAY
AS I SAID BEFORE THAT I REALLY CANNOT ACCEPT IT
REMARKS SIMILAR TO THESE HAD BEEN MADE BY THOMAS BULLER AND WILLIAM
PODINGTON AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR FOR SOME FIVE YEARS
THEY WERE OLD
FRIENDS THEY HAD BEEN SCHOOLBOYS TOGETHER AND HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED IN
BUSINESS SINCE THEY WERE YOUNG MEN
THEY HAD NOW REACHED A VIGOROUS
MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE EACH MARRIED AND EACH HAD A HOUSE IN THE
COUNTRY IN WHICH HE RESIDED FOR A PART OF THE YEAR
THEY WERE WARMLY
ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND EACH WAS THE BEST FRIEND WHICH THE OTHER
HAD IN THIS WORLD
BUT DURING ALL THESE YEARS NEITHER OF THEM HAD
VISITED THE OTHER IN HIS COUNTRY HOME
THE REASON FOR THIS AVOIDANCE OF EACH OTHER AT THEIR RESPECTIVE RURAL
RESIDENCES MAY BE BRIEFLY STATED
MR
BULLER'S COUNTRY HOUSE WAS
SITUATED BY THE SEA AND HE WAS VERY FOND OF THE WATER
HE HAD A GOOD
CAT BOAT WHICH HE SAILED HIMSELF WITH MUCH JUDGMENT AND SKILL AND IT
WAS HIS GREATEST PLEASURE TO TAKE HIS FRIENDS AND VISITORS UPON LITTLE
EXCURSIONS ON THE BAY
BUT MR
PODINGTON WAS DESPERATELY AFRAID OF THE
WATER AND HE WAS PARTICULARLY AFRAID OF ANY CRAFT SAILED BY AN
AMATEUR
IF HIS FRIEND BULLER WOULD HAVE EMPLOYED A PROFESSIONAL
MARINER OF YEARS AND EXPERIENCE TO STEER AND MANAGE HIS BOAT
PODINGTON MIGHT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO TAKE AN OCCASIONAL SAIL BUT AS
BULLER ALWAYS INSISTED UPON SAILING HIS OWN BOAT AND TOOK IT ILL IF
ANY OF HIS VISITORS DOUBTED HIS ABILITY TO DO SO PROPERLY PODINGTON
DID NOT WISH TO WOUND THE SELF LOVE OF HIS FRIEND AND HE DID NOT WISH
TO BE DROWNED
CONSEQUENTLY HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO CONSENT TO
GO TO BULLER'S HOUSE BY THE SEA
TO RECEIVE HIS GOOD FRIEND BULLER AT HIS OWN HOUSE IN THE BEAUTIFUL
UPLAND REGION IN WHICH HE LIVED WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT JOY TO MR
PODINGTON BUT BULLER COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO VISIT HIM
PODINGTON WAS
VERY FOND OF HORSES AND ALWAYS DROVE HIMSELF WHILE BULLER WAS MORE
AFRAID OF HORSES THAN HE WAS OF ELEPHANTS OR LIONS
TO ONE OR MORE
HORSES DRIVEN BY A COACHMAN OF YEARS AND EXPERIENCE HE DID NOT ALWAYS
OBJECT BUT TO A HORSE DRIVEN BY PODINGTON WHO HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE
AND KNOWLEDGE REGARDING MERCANTILE AFFAIRS BUT WAS MERELY AN AMATEUR
HORSEMAN HE MOST DECIDEDLY AND STRONGLY OBJECTED
HE DID NOT WISH TO
HURT HIS FRIEND'S FEELINGS BY REFUSING TO GO OUT TO DRIVE WITH HIM
BUT HE WOULD NOT RACK HIS OWN NERVOUS SYSTEM BY ACCOMPANYING HIM
THEREFORE IT WAS THAT HE HAD NOT YET VISITED THE BEAUTIFUL UPLAND
COUNTRY RESIDENCE OF MR
PODINGTON
AT LAST THIS STATE OF THINGS GREW AWKWARD
MRS
BULLER AND MRS
PODINGTON OFTEN WITH THEIR FAMILIES VISITED EACH OTHER AT THEIR
COUNTRY HOUSES BUT THE FACT THAT ON THESE OCCASIONS THEY WERE NEVER
ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR HUSBANDS CAUSED MORE AND MORE GOSSIP AMONG THEIR
NEIGHBORS BOTH IN THE UPLAND COUNTRY AND BY THE SEA
ONE DAY IN SPRING AS THE TWO SAT IN THEIR CITY OFFICE WHERE MR
PODINGTON HAD JUST REPEATED HIS ANNUAL INVITATION HIS FRIEND REPLIED
TO HIM THUS
WILLIAM IF I COME TO SEE YOU THIS SUMMER WILL YOU VISIT ME THE
THING IS BEGINNING TO LOOK A LITTLE RIDICULOUS AND PEOPLE ARE TALKING
ABOUT IT
MR
PODINGTON PUT HIS HAND TO HIS BROW AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS CLOSED
HIS EYES
IN HIS MIND HE SAW A CAT BOAT UPON ITS SIDE THE SAILS
SPREAD OUT OVER THE WATER AND TWO MEN ALMOST ENTIRELY IMMERSED IN
THE WAVES MAKING EFFORTS TO REACH THE SIDE OF THE BOAT
ONE OF THESE
WAS GETTING ON VERY WELL THAT WAS BULLER
THE OTHER SEEMED ABOUT TO
SINK HIS ARMS WERE USELESSLY WAVING IN THE AIR THAT WAS HIMSELF
BUT
HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED BRAVELY OUT OF THE WINDOW IT WAS TIME
TO CONQUER ALL THIS IT WAS INDEED GROWING RIDICULOUS
BULLER HAD BEEN
SAILING MANY YEARS AND HAD NEVER BEEN UPSET
YES SAID HE I WILL DO IT I AM READY ANY TIME YOU NAME
MR
BULLER ROSE AND STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND
GOOD SAID HE IT IS A COMPACT
BULLER WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE THE PROMISED COUNTRY VISIT
HE HAD NOT
MENTIONED THE SUBJECT OF HORSES TO HIS FRIEND BUT HE KNEW THROUGH
MRS
BULLER THAT PODINGTON STILL CONTINUED TO BE HIS OWN DRIVER
SHE
HAD INFORMED HIM HOWEVER THAT AT PRESENT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DRIVE
A BIG BLACK HORSE WHICH IN HER OPINION WAS AS GENTLE AND RELIABLE AS
THESE ANIMALS EVER BECAME AND SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW ANYBODY COULD
BE AFRAID OF HIM
SO WHEN THE NEXT MORNING AFTER HIS ARRIVAL MR
BULLER WAS ASKED BY HIS HOST IF HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A DRIVE HE
SUPPRESSED A CERTAIN RISING EMOTION AND SAID THAT IT WOULD PLEASE HIM
VERY MUCH
WHEN THE GOOD BLACK HORSE HAD JOGGED ALONG A PLEASANT ROAD FOR HALF AN
HOUR MR
BULLER BEGAN TO FEEL THAT PERHAPS FOR ALL THESE YEARS HE
HAD BEEN LABORING UNDER A MISCONCEPTION
IT SEEMED TO BE POSSIBLE THAT
THERE WERE SOME HORSES TO WHICH SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE SHAPE
OF SIGHTS AND SOUNDS WERE SO IRRELEVANT THAT THEY WERE TO A CERTAIN
DEGREE ENTIRELY SAFE EVEN WHEN GUIDED AND CONTROLLED BY AN AMATEUR
HAND
AS THEY PASSED SOME MEADOW LAND SOMEBODY BEHIND A HEDGE FIRED A
GUN MR
BULLER WAS FRIGHTENED BUT THE HORSE WAS NOT
WILLIAM SAID BULLER LOOKING CHEERFULLY AROUND HIM
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU LIVED IN SUCH A PRETTY COUNTRY
IN FACT I
MIGHT ALMOST CALL IT BEAUTIFUL
YOU HAVE NOT ANY WIDE STRETCH OF
WATER SUCH AS I LIKE SO MUCH BUT HERE IS A PRETTY RIVER THOSE
ROLLING HILLS ARE VERY CHARMING AND BEYOND YOU HAVE THE BLUE OF THE
MOUNTAINS
IT IS LOVELY SAID HIS FRIEND I NEVER GET TIRED OF DRIVING THROUGH
THIS COUNTRY
OF COURSE THE SEASIDE IS VERY FINE BUT HERE WE HAVE
SUCH A VARIETY OF SCENERY
MR
BULLER COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT SOMETIMES THE SEASIDE WAS A
LITTLE MONOTONOUS AND THAT HE HAD LOST A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE BY
NOT VARYING HIS SUMMERS BY GOING UP TO SPEND A WEEK OR TWO WITH
PODINGTON
WILLIAM SAID HE HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THIS HORSE
ABOUT TWO YEARS SAID MR
PODINGTON BEFORE I GOT HIM I USED TO
DRIVE A PAIR
HEAVENS THOUGHT BULLER HOW LUCKY I WAS NOT TO COME TWO YEARS
AGO AND HIS REGRETS FOR NOT SOONER VISITING HIS FRIEND GREATLY
DECREASED
NOW THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM BY WHICH THE ROAD RAN HAD
BEEN DAMMED FOR A MILL AND HAD WIDENED INTO A BEAUTIFUL POND
THERE NOW CRIED MR
BULLER
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
WILLIAM YOU SEEM
TO HAVE EVERYTHING THIS IS REALLY A VERY PRETTY SHEET OF WATER AND
THE REFLECTIONS OF THE TREES OVER THERE MAKE A CHARMING PICTURE YOU
CAN'T GET THAT AT THE SEASIDE YOU KNOW
MR
PODINGTON WAS DELIGHTED HIS FACE GLOWED HE WAS REJOICED AT THE
PLEASURE OF HIS FRIEND
I TELL YOU THOMAS SAID HE THAT
WILLIAM EXCLAIMED BULLER WITH A SUDDEN SQUIRM IN HIS SEAT WHAT
IS THAT I HEAR IS THAT A TRAIN
YES SAID MR
PODINGTON THAT IS THE TEN FORTY UP
DOES IT COME NEAR HERE ASKED MR
BULLER NERVOUSLY
DOES IT GO
OVER THAT BRIDGE
YES SAID PODINGTON BUT IT CAN'T HURT US FOR OUR ROAD GOES UNDER
THE BRIDGE WE ARE PERFECTLY SAFE THERE IS NO RISK OF ACCIDENT
BUT YOUR HORSE YOUR HORSE EXCLAIMED BULLER AS THE TRAIN CAME
NEARER AND NEARER
WHAT WILL HE DO
DO SAID PODINGTON HE'LL DO WHAT HE IS DOING NOW HE DOESN'T MIND
TRAINS
BUT LOOK HERE WILLIAM EXCLAIMED BULLER IT WILL GET THERE JUST AS
WE DO NO HORSE COULD STAND A ROARING UP IN THE AIR LIKE THAT
PODINGTON LAUGHED
HE WOULD NOT MIND IT IN THE LEAST SAID HE
COME COME NOW CRIED BULLER
REALLY I CAN'T STAND THIS JUST STOP
A MINUTE WILLIAM AND LET ME GET OUT
IT SETS ALL MY NERVES
QUIVERING
MR
PODINGTON SMILED WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
OH YOU NEEDN'T GET OUT
SAID HE THERE'S NOT THE LEAST DANGER IN THE WORLD
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU NERVOUS AND I WILL TURN AROUND AND DRIVE THE OTHER WAY
BUT YOU CAN'T SCREAMED BULLER
THIS ROAD IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH AND
THAT TRAIN IS NEARLY HERE
PLEASE STOP
THE IMPUTATION THAT THE ROAD WAS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO TURN WAS
TOO MUCH FOR MR
PODINGTON TO BEAR
HE WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
TO TURN A VEHICLE IN A NARROW PLACE
TURN SAID HE THAT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD
SEE A LITTLE
TO THE RIGHT THEN A BACK THEN A SWEEP TO THE LEFT AND WE WILL BE
GOING THE OTHER WAY AND INSTANTLY HE BEGAN THE MANEUVER IN WHICH HE
WAS SUCH AN ADEPT
OH THOMAS CRIED BULLER HALF RISING IN HIS SEAT THAT TRAIN IS
ALMOST HERE
AND WE ARE ALMOST MR
PODINGTON WAS ABOUT TO SAY TURNED
AROUND BUT HE STOPPED
MR
BULLER'S EXCLAMATIONS HAD MADE HIM A
LITTLE NERVOUS AND IN HIS ANXIETY TO TURN QUICKLY HE HAD PULLED
UPON HIS HORSE'S BIT WITH MORE ENERGY THAN WAS ACTUALLY NECESSARY AND
HIS NERVOUSNESS BEING COMMUNICATED TO THE HORSE THAT ANIMAL BACKED
WITH SUCH EXTRAORDINARY VIGOR THAT THE HIND WHEELS OF THE WAGON WENT
OVER A BIT OF GRASS BY THE ROAD AND INTO THE WATER
THE SUDDEN JOLT
GAVE A NEW IMPETUS TO MR
BULLER'S FEARS
YOU'LL UPSET HE CRIED AND NOT THINKING OF WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE
LAID HOLD OF HIS FRIEND'S ARM
THE HORSE STARTLED BY THIS SUDDEN JERK
UPON HIS BIT WHICH COMBINED WITH THE THUNDERING OF THE TRAIN WHICH
WAS NOW ON THE BRIDGE MADE HIM THINK THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WAS
ABOUT TO HAPPEN GAVE A SUDDEN AND FORCIBLE START BACKWARD SO THAT
NOT ONLY THE HIND WHEELS OF THE LIGHT WAGON BUT THE FORE WHEELS AND
HIS OWN HIND LEGS WENT INTO THE WATER
AS THE BANK AT THIS SPOT SLOPED
STEEPLY THE WAGON CONTINUED TO GO BACKWARD DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF
THE AGITATED HORSE TO FIND A FOOTING ON THE CRUMBLING EDGE OF THE
BANK
WHOA CRIED MR
BULLER
GET UP EXCLAIMED MR
PODINGTON APPLYING HIS WHIP UPON THE PLUNGING
BEAST
BUT EXCLAMATIONS AND CASTIGATIONS HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE HORSE
THE
ORIGINAL BED OF THE STREAM RAN CLOSE TO THE ROAD AND THE BANK WAS SO
STEEP AND THE EARTH SO SOFT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE HORSE TO
ADVANCE OR EVEN MAINTAIN HIS FOOTING
BACK BACK HE WENT UNTIL THE
WHOLE EQUIPAGE WAS IN THE WATER AND THE WAGON WAS AFLOAT
THIS VEHICLE WAS A ROAD WAGON WITHOUT A TOP AND THE JOINTS OF ITS
BOX BODY WERE TIGHT ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE WATER FROM IMMEDIATELY
ENTERING IT SO SOMEWHAT DEEPLY SUNKEN IT RESTED UPON THE WATER
THERE WAS A CURRENT IN THIS PART OF THE POND AND IT TURNED THE WAGON
DOWNSTREAM
THE HORSE WAS NOW ENTIRELY IMMERSED IN THE WATER WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF HIS HEAD AND THE UPPER PART OF HIS NECK AND UNABLE TO
REACH THE BOTTOM WITH HIS FEET HE MADE VIGOROUS EFFORTS TO SWIM
MR
PODINGTON THE REINS AND WHIP IN HIS HANDS SAT HORRIFIED AND
PALE THE ACCIDENT WAS SO SUDDEN HE WAS SO STARTLED AND SO FRIGHTENED
THAT FOR A MOMENT HE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
MR
BULLER ON THE
OTHER HAND WAS NOW LIVELY AND ALERT
THE WAGON HAD NO SOONER FLOATED
AWAY FROM THE SHORE THAN HE FELT HIMSELF AT HOME
HE WAS UPON HIS
FAVORITE ELEMENT WATER HAD NO FEARS FOR HIM
HE SAW THAT HIS FRIEND
WAS NEARLY FRIGHTENED OUT OF HIS WITS AND THAT FIGURATIVELY
SPEAKING HE MUST STEP TO THE HELM AND TAKE CHARGE OF THE VESSEL
HE
STOOD UP AND GAZED ABOUT HIM
PUT HER ACROSS STREAM HE SHOUTED SHE CAN'T MAKE HEADWAY AGAINST
THIS CURRENT
HEAD HER TO THAT CLUMP OF TREES ON THE OTHER SIDE THE
BANK IS LOWER THERE AND WE CAN BEACH HER
MOVE A LITTLE THE OTHER
WAY WE MUST TRIM BOAT
NOW THEN PULL ON YOUR STARBOARD REIN
PODINGTON OBEYED AND THE HORSE SLIGHTLY CHANGED HIS DIRECTION
YOU SEE SAID BULLER IT WON'T DO TO SAIL STRAIGHT ACROSS BECAUSE
THE CURRENT WOULD CARRY US DOWN AND LAND US BELOW THAT SPOT
MR
PODINGTON SAID NOT A WORD HE EXPECTED EVERY MOMENT TO SEE THE
HORSE SINK INTO A WATERY GRAVE
IT ISN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL IS IT PODINGTON IF WE HAD A RUDDER AND A
BIT OF A SAIL IT WOULD BE A GREAT HELP TO THE HORSE
THIS WAGON IS NOT
A BAD BOAT
THE DESPAIRING PODINGTON LOOKED AT HIS FEET
IT'S COMING IN HE SAID
IN A HUSKY VOICE
THOMAS THE WATER IS OVER MY SHOES
THAT IS SO SAID BULLER
I AM SO USED TO WATER I DIDN'T NOTICE IT
SHE LEAKS
DO YOU CARRY ANYTHING TO BAIL HER OUT WITH
BAIL CRIED PODINGTON NOW FINDING HIS VOICE
OH THOMAS WE ARE
SINKING
THAT'S SO SAID BULLER SHE LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE
THE WEIGHT OF THE RUNNING GEAR AND OF THE TWO MEN WAS ENTIRELY TOO
MUCH FOR THE BUOYANCY OF THE WAGON BODY
THE WATER RAPIDLY ROSE TOWARD
THE TOP OF ITS SIDES
WE ARE GOING TO DROWN CRIED PODINGTON SUDDENLY RISING
LICK HIM LICK HIM EXCLAIMED BULLER
MAKE HIM SWIM FASTER
THERE'S NOTHING TO LICK CRIED PODINGTON VAINLY LASHING AT THE
WATER FOR HE COULD NOT REACH THE HORSE'S HEAD
THE POOR MAN WAS
DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED HE HAD NEVER EVEN IMAGINED IT POSSIBLE THAT HE
SHOULD BE DROWNED IN HIS OWN WAGON
WHOOP CRIED BULLER AS THE WATER ROSE OVER THE SIDES
STEADY
YOURSELF OLD BOY OR YOU'LL GO OVERBOARD AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE
WAGON BODY SUNK OUT OF SIGHT
BUT IT DID NOT GO DOWN VERY FAR
THE DEEPEST PART OF THE CHANNEL OF
THE STREAM HAD BEEN PASSED AND WITH A BUMP THE WHEELS STRUCK THE
BOTTOM
HEAVENS EXCLAIMED BULLER WE ARE AGROUND
AGROUND EXCLAIMED PODINGTON HEAVEN BE PRAISED
AS THE TWO MEN STOOD UP IN THE SUBMERGED WAGON THE WATER WAS ABOVE
THEIR KNEES AND WHEN PODINGTON LOOKED OUT OVER THE SURFACE OF THE
POND NOW SO NEAR HIS FACE IT SEEMED LIKE A SHEET OF WATER HE HAD
NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IT WAS SOMETHING HORRIBLE THREATENING TO RISE AND
ENVELOP HIM
HE TREMBLED SO THAT HE COULD SCARCELY KEEP HIS FOOTING
WILLIAM SAID HIS COMPANION YOU MUST SIT DOWN IF YOU DON'T
YOU'LL TUMBLE OVERBOARD AND BE DROWNED
THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU TO
HOLD TO
SIT DOWN SAID PODINGTON GAZING BLANKLY AT THE WATER AROUND HIM I
CAN'T DO THAT
AT THIS MOMENT THE HORSE MADE A SLIGHT MOVEMENT
HAVING TOUCHED BOTTOM
AFTER HIS EFFORTS IN SWIMMING ACROSS THE MAIN BED OF THE STREAM WITH
A FLOATING WAGON IN TOW HE HAD STOOD FOR A FEW MOMENTS HIS HEAD AND
NECK WELL ABOVE WATER AND HIS BACK BARELY VISIBLE BENEATH THE
SURFACE
HAVING RECOVERED HIS BREATH HE NOW THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO
MOVE ON
AT THE FIRST STEP OF THE HORSE MR
PODINGTON BEGAN TO TOTTER
INSTINCTIVELY HE CLUTCHED BULLER
SIT DOWN CRIED THE LATTER OR YOU'LL HAVE US BOTH OVERBOARD
THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT DOWN SAT MR
PODINGTON AND AS WITH A GREAT
SPLASH HE CAME HEAVILY UPON THE SEAT THE WATER ROSE TO HIS WAIST
OUGH SAID HE
THOMAS SHOUT FOR HELP
NO USE DOING THAT REPLIED BULLER STILL STANDING ON HIS NAUTICAL
LEGS I DON'T SEE ANYBODY AND I DON'T SEE ANY BOAT
WE'LL GET OUT
ALL RIGHT
JUST YOU STICK TIGHT TO THE THWART
THE WHAT FEEBLY ASKED THE OTHER
OH THE SEAT I MEAN
WE CAN GET TO THE SHORE ALL RIGHT IF YOU STEER
THE HORSE STRAIGHT
HEAD HIM MORE ACROSS THE POND
I CAN'T HEAD HIM CRIED PODINGTON
I HAVE DROPPED THE REINS
GOOD GRACIOUS CRIED MR
BULLER THAT'S BAD
CAN'T YOU STEER HIM BY
SHOUTING 'GEE' AND 'HAW'
NO SAID PODINGTON HE ISN'T AN OX BUT PERHAPS I CAN STOP HIM
AND WITH AS MUCH VOICE AS HE COULD SUMMON HE CALLED OUT WHOA AND
THE HORSE STOPPED
IF YOU CAN'T STEER HIM ANY OTHER WAY SAID BULLER WE MUST GET THE
REINS
LEND ME YOUR WHIP
I HAVE DROPPED THAT TOO SAID PODINGTON THERE IT FLOATS
OH DEAR SAID BULLER I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO DIVE FOR THEM IF HE
WERE TO RUN AWAY WE SHOULD BE IN AN AWFUL FIX
DON'T GET OUT DON'T GET OUT EXCLAIMED PODINGTON
YOU CAN REACH
OVER THE DASHBOARD
AS THAT'S UNDER WATER SAID BULLER IT WILL BE THE SAME THING AS
DIVING BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE AND I'LL TRY IT
DON'T YOU MOVE NOW
I AM MORE USED TO WATER THAN YOU ARE
MR
BULLER TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND ASKED HIS FRIEND TO HOLD IT
HE
THOUGHT OF HIS WATCH AND OTHER CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS BUT THERE WAS
NO PLACE TO PUT THEM SO HE GAVE THEM NO MORE CONSIDERATION
THEN
BRAVELY GETTING ON HIS KNEES IN THE WATER HE LEANED OVER THE
DASHBOARD ALMOST DISAPPEARING FROM SIGHT
WITH HIS DISENGAGED HAND
MR
PODINGTON GRASPED THE SUBMERGED COAT TAILS OF HIS FRIEND
IN A FEW SECONDS THE UPPER PART OF MR
BULLER ROSE FROM THE WATER
HE
WAS DRIPPING AND PUFFING AND MR
PODINGTON COULD NOT BUT THINK WHAT A
DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN THE APPEARANCE OF HIS FRIEND TO HAVE HIS HAIR
PLASTERED CLOSE TO HIS HEAD
I GOT HOLD OF ONE OF THEM SAID THE SPUTTERING BULLER BUT IT WAS
FAST TO SOMETHING AND I COULDN'T GET IT LOOSE
WAS IT THICK AND WIDE ASKED PODINGTON
YES WAS THE ANSWER IT DID SEEM SO
OH THAT WAS A TRACE SAID PODINGTON I DON'T WANT THAT THE REINS
ARE THINNER AND LIGHTER
NOW I REMEMBER THEY ARE SAID BULLER
I'LL GO DOWN AGAIN
AGAIN MR
BULLER LEANED OVER THE DASHBOARD AND THIS TIME HE REMAINED
DOWN LONGER AND WHEN HE CAME UP HE PUFFED AND SPUTTERED MORE THAN
BEFORE
IS THIS IT SAID HE HOLDING UP A STRIP OF WET LEATHER
YES SAID PODINGTON YOU'VE GOT THE REINS
WELL TAKE THEM AND STEER
I WOULD HAVE FOUND THEM SOONER IF HIS
TAIL HAD NOT GOT INTO MY EYES
THAT LONG TAIL'S FLOATING DOWN THERE
AND SPREADING ITSELF OUT LIKE A FAN IT TANGLED ITSELF ALL AROUND MY
HEAD
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH EASIER IF HE HAD BEEN A BOB TAILED
HORSE
NOW THEN SAID PODINGTON TAKE YOUR HAT THOMAS AND I'LL TRY TO
DRIVE
MR
BULLER PUT ON HIS HAT WHICH WAS THE ONLY DRY THING ABOUT HIM AND
THE NERVOUS PODINGTON STARTED THE HORSE SO SUDDENLY THAT EVEN THE
SEA LEGS OF BULLER WERE SURPRISED AND HE CAME VERY NEAR GOING
BACKWARD INTO THE WATER BUT RECOVERING HIMSELF HE SAT DOWN
I DON'T WONDER YOU DID NOT LIKE TO DO THIS WILLIAM SAID HE
WET
AS I AM IT'S GHASTLY
ENCOURAGED BY HIS MASTER'S VOICE AND BY THE FEELING OF THE FAMILIAR
HAND UPON HIS BIT THE HORSE MOVED BRAVELY ON
BUT THE BOTTOM WAS VERY ROUGH AND UNEVEN
SOMETIMES THE WHEELS STRUCK
A LARGE STONE TERRIFYING MR
BULLER WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO
UPSET AND SOMETIMES THEY SANK INTO SOFT MUD HORRIFYING MR
PODINGTON WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO DROWN
THUS PROCEEDING THEY PRESENTED A STRANGE SIGHT
AT FIRST MR
PODINGTON HELD HIS HANDS ABOVE THE WATER AS HE DROVE BUT HE SOON
FOUND THIS AWKWARD AND DROPPED THEM TO THEIR USUAL POSITION SO THAT
NOTHING WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER BUT THE HEAD AND NECK OF A HORSE
AND THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF TWO MEN
NOW THE SUBMARINE EQUIPAGE CAME TO A LOW PLACE IN THE BOTTOM AND EVEN
MR
BULLER SHUDDERED AS THE WATER ROSE TO HIS CHIN
PODINGTON GAVE A
HOWL OF HORROR AND THE HORSE WITH HIGH UPLIFTED HEAD WAS OBLIGED
TO SWIM
AT THIS MOMENT A BOY WITH A GUN CAME STROLLING ALONG THE
ROAD AND HEARING MR
PODINGTON'S CRY HE CAST HIS EYES OVER THE
WATER
INSTINCTIVELY HE RAISED HIS WEAPON TO HIS SHOULDER AND THEN
IN AN INSTANT PERCEIVING THAT THE OBJECTS HE BEHELD WERE NOT AQUATIC
BIRDS HE DROPPED HIS GUN AND RAN YELLING DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD THE
MILL
BUT THE HOLLOW IN THE BOTTOM WAS A NARROW ONE AND WHEN IT WAS PASSED
THE DEPTH OF THE WATER GRADUALLY DECREASED
THE BACK OF THE HORSE CAME
INTO VIEW THE DASHBOARD BECAME VISIBLE AND THE BODIES AND THE
SPIRITS OF THE TWO MEN RAPIDLY ROSE
NOW THERE WAS VIGOROUS SPLASHING
AND TUGGING AND THEN A JET BLACK HORSE SHINING AS IF HE HAD BEEN
NEWLY VARNISHED PULLED A DRIPPING WAGON CONTAINING TWO WELL SOAKED
MEN UPON A SHELVING SHORE
OH I AM CHILLED TO THE BONES SAID PODINGTON
I SHOULD THINK SO REPLIED HIS FRIEND IF YOU HAVE GOT TO BE WET
IT IS A GREAT DEAL PLEASANTER UNDER THE WATER
THERE WAS A FIELD ROAD ON THIS SIDE OF THE POND WHICH PODINGTON WELL
KNEW AND PROCEEDING ALONG THIS THEY CAME TO THE BRIDGE AND GOT INTO
THE MAIN ROAD
NOW WE MUST GET HOME AS FAST AS WE CAN CRIED PODINGTON OR WE
SHALL BOTH TAKE COLD
I WISH I HADN'T LOST MY WHIP
HI NOW GET
ALONG
PODINGTON WAS NOW FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY HIS WHEELS WERE ON THE HARD
ROAD AND HE WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
WHEN HE FOUND HIS HEAD WAS TURNED TOWARD HIS HOME THE HORSE SET OFF
AT A GREAT RATE
HI THERE CRIED PODINGTON
I AM SO SORRY I LOST MY WHIP
WHIP SAID BULLER HOLDING FAST TO THE SIDE OF THE SEAT SURELY YOU
DON'T WANT HIM TO GO ANY FASTER THAN THIS
AND LOOK HERE WILLIAM HE
ADDED IT SEEMS TO ME WE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO TAKE COLD IN OUR WET
CLOTHES IF WE RUSH THROUGH THE AIR IN THIS WAY
REALLY IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT HORSE IS RUNNING AWAY
NOT A BIT OF IT CRIED PODINGTON
HE WANTS TO GET HOME AND HE
WANTS HIS DINNER
ISN'T HE A FINE HORSE LOOK HOW HE STEPS OUT
STEPS OUT SAID BULLER I THINK I'D LIKE TO STEP OUT MYSELF
DON'T
YOU THINK IT WOULD BE WISER FOR ME TO WALK HOME WILLIAM THAT WILL
WARM ME UP
IT WILL TAKE YOU AN HOUR SAID HIS FRIEND
STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND
I'LL HAVE YOU IN A DRY SUIT OF CLOTHES IN LESS THAN FIFTEEN MINUTES
I TELL YOU WILLIAM SAID MR
BULLER AS THE TWO SAT SMOKING AFTER
DINNER WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO YOU SHOULD NEVER GO OUT DRIVING WITHOUT
A LIFE PRESERVER AND A PAIR OF OARS I ALWAYS TAKE THEM
IT WOULD MAKE
YOU FEEL SAFER
MR
BULLER WENT HOME THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE MR
PODINGTON'S CLOTHES DID
NOT FIT HIM AND HIS OWN OUTDOOR SUIT WAS SO SHRUNKEN AS TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE
BESIDES THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON CONNECTED WITH THE
DESIRE OF HORSES TO REACH THEIR HOMES WHICH PROMPTED HIS RETURN
BUT
HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS COMPACT WITH HIS FRIEND AND IN THE COURSE OF
A WEEK HE WROTE TO PODINGTON INVITING HIM TO SPEND SOME DAYS WITH
HIM
MR
PODINGTON WAS A MAN OF HONOR AND IN SPITE OF HIS RECENT
UNFORTUNATE WATER EXPERIENCE HE WOULD NOT BREAK HIS WORD
HE WENT TO
MR
BULLER'S SEASIDE HOME AT THE TIME APPOINTED
EARLY ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS ARRIVAL BEFORE THE FAMILY WERE UP MR
PODINGTON WENT OUT AND STROLLED DOWN TO THE EDGE OF THE BAY
HE WENT
TO LOOK AT BULLER'S BOAT
HE WAS WELL AWARE THAT HE WOULD BE ASKED TO
TAKE A SAIL AND AS BULLER HAD DRIVEN WITH HIM IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO DECLINE SAILING WITH BULLER BUT HE MUST SEE THE BOAT
THERE WAS A TRAIN FOR HIS HOME AT A QUARTER PAST SEVEN IF HE WERE NOT
ON THE PREMISES HE COULD NOT BE ASKED TO SAIL
IF BULLER'S BOAT WERE A
LITTLE FLIMSY THING HE WOULD TAKE THAT TRAIN BUT HE WOULD WAIT AND
SEE
THERE WAS ONLY ONE SMALL BOAT ANCHORED NEAR THE BEACH AND A
MAN APPARENTLY A FISHERMAN INFORMED MR
PODINGTON THAT IT BELONGED
TO MR
BULLER
PODINGTON LOOKED AT IT EAGERLY IT WAS NOT VERY SMALL
AND NOT FLIMSY
DO YOU CONSIDER THAT A SAFE BOAT HE ASKED THE FISHERMAN
SAFE REPLIED THE MAN
YOU COULD NOT UPSET HER IF YOU TRIED
LOOK
AT HER BREADTH OF BEAM YOU COULD GO ANYWHERE IN THAT BOAT ARE YOU
THINKING OF BUYING HER
THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD THINK OF BUYING A BOAT MADE MR
PODINGTON
LAUGH
THE INFORMATION THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO UPSET THE LITTLE
VESSEL HAD GREATLY CHEERED HIM AND HE COULD LAUGH
SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST MR
BULLER LIKE A NURSE WITH A DOSE OF
MEDICINE CAME TO MR
PODINGTON WITH THE EXPECTED INVITATION TO TAKE A
SAIL
NOW WILLIAM SAID HIS HOST I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY YOUR FEELING
ABOUT BOATS AND WHAT I WISH TO PROVE TO YOU IS THAT IT IS A FEELING
WITHOUT ANY FOUNDATION
I DON'T WANT TO SHOCK YOU OR MAKE YOU NERVOUS
SO I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT TODAY ON THE BAY IN MY BOAT
YOU ARE
AS SAFE ON THE BAY AS YOU WOULD BE ON LAND A LITTLE SAFER PERHAPS
UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO WHICH WE WILL NOT ALLUDE BUT STILL IT
IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE ROUGH AND THIS AT FIRST MIGHT CAUSE YOU SOME
UNEASINESS AND SO I AM GOING TO LET YOU BEGIN YOUR EDUCATION IN THE
SAILING LINE ON PERFECTLY SMOOTH WATER
ABOUT THREE MILES BACK OF US
THERE IS A VERY PRETTY LAKE SEVERAL MILES LONG
IT IS PART OF THE
CANAL SYSTEM WHICH CONNECTS THE TOWN WITH THE RAILROAD
I HAVE SENT MY
BOAT TO THE TOWN AND WE CAN WALK UP THERE AND GO BY THE CANAL TO THE
LAKE IT IS ONLY ABOUT THREE MILES
IF HE HAD TO SAIL AT ALL THIS KIND OF SAILING SUITED MR
PODINGTON
A
CANAL A QUIET LAKE AND A BOAT WHICH COULD NOT BE UPSET
WHEN THEY
REACHED THE TOWN THE BOAT WAS IN THE CANAL READY FOR THEM
NOW SAID MR
BULLER YOU GET IN AND MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE
MY
IDEA IS TO HITCH ON TO A CANAL BOAT AND BE TOWED TO THE LAKE
THE
BOATS GENERALLY START ABOUT THIS TIME IN THE MORNING AND I WILL GO
AND SEE ABOUT IT
MR
PODINGTON UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HIS FRIEND TOOK A SEAT IN THE
STERN OF THE SAILBOAT AND THEN HE REMARKED
THOMAS HAVE YOU A LIFE PRESERVER ON BOARD YOU KNOW I AM NOT USED TO
ANY KIND OF VESSEL AND I AM CLUMSY
NOTHING MIGHT HAPPEN TO THE BOAT
BUT I MIGHT TRIP AND FALL OVERBOARD AND I CAN'T SWIM
ALL RIGHT SAID BULLER HERE'S A LIFE PRESERVER AND YOU CAN PUT IT
ON
I WANT YOU TO FEEL PERFECTLY SAFE
NOW I WILL GO AND SEE ABOUT THE
TOW
BUT MR
BULLER FOUND THAT THE CANAL BOATS WOULD NOT START AT THEIR
USUAL TIME THE LOADING OF ONE OF THEM WAS NOT FINISHED AND HE WAS
INFORMED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN HOUR OR MORE
THIS DID NOT
SUIT MR
BULLER AT ALL AND HE DID NOT HESITATE TO SHOW HIS ANNOYANCE
I TELL YOU SIR WHAT YOU CAN DO SAID ONE OF THE MEN IN CHARGE OF
THE BOATS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT TILL WE ARE READY TO START
WE'LL LET YOU HAVE A BOY AND A HORSE TO TOW YOU UP TO THE LAKE
THAT
WON'T COST YOU MUCH AND THEY'LL BE BACK BEFORE WE WANT 'EM
THE BARGAIN WAS MADE AND MR
BULLER JOYFULLY RETURNED TO HIS BOAT
WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY WERE NOT TO WAIT FOR THE CANAL BOATS
A LONG ROPE WITH A HORSE ATTACHED TO THE OTHER END OF IT WAS
SPEEDILY MADE FAST TO THE BOAT AND WITH A BOY AT THE HEAD OF THE
HORSE THEY STARTED UP THE CANAL
NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF SAILING I LIKE SAID MR
PODINGTON
IF I
LIVED NEAR A CANAL I BELIEVE I WOULD BUY A BOAT AND TRAIN MY HORSE TO
TOW
I COULD HAVE A LONG PAIR OF ROPE LINES AND DRIVE HIM MYSELF THEN
WHEN THE ROADS WERE ROUGH AND BAD THE CANAL WOULD ALWAYS BE SMOOTH
THIS IS ALL VERY NICE REPLIED MR
BULLER WHO SAT BY THE TILLER TO
KEEP THE BOAT AWAY FROM THE BANK AND I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU IN A BOAT
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
DO YOU KNOW WILLIAM THAT ALTHOUGH I DID NOT
PLAN IT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A BETTER WAY TO BEGIN YOUR SAILING
EDUCATION
HERE WE GLIDE ALONG SLOWLY AND GENTLY WITH NO POSSIBLE
THOUGHT OF DANGER FOR IF THE BOAT SHOULD SUDDENLY SPRING A LEAK AS
IF IT WERE THE BODY OF A WAGON ALL WE WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO
STEP ON SHORE AND BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE END OF THE CANAL YOU
WILL LIKE THIS GENTLE MOTION SO MUCH THAT YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY READY
TO BEGIN THE SECOND STAGE OF YOUR NAUTICAL EDUCATION
YES SAID MR
PODINGTON
HOW LONG DID YOU SAY THIS CANAL IS
ABOUT THREE MILES ANSWERED HIS FRIEND
THEN WE WILL GO INTO THE
LOCK AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE SHALL BE ON THE LAKE
SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED SAID MR
PODINGTON I WISH THE CANAL WERE
TWELVE MILES LONG
I CANNOT IMAGINE ANYTHING PLEASANTER THAN THIS
IF
I LIVED ANYWHERE NEAR A CANAL A LONG CANAL I MEAN THIS ONE IS TOO
SHORT I'D
COME COME NOW INTERRUPTED BULLER
DON'T BE CONTENT TO STAY IN THE
PRIMARY SCHOOL JUST BECAUSE IT IS EASY
WHEN WE GET ON THE LAKE I WILL
SHOW YOU THAT IN A BOAT WITH A GENTLE BREEZE SUCH AS WE ARE LIKELY
TO HAVE TODAY YOU WILL FIND THE MOTION QUITE AS PLEASING AND EVER SO
MUCH MORE INSPIRITING
I SHOULD NOT BE A BIT SURPRISED WILLIAM IF
AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN TWO OR THREE TIMES ON THE LAKE YOU WILL ASK
ME YES POSITIVELY ASK ME TO TAKE YOU OUT ON THE BAY
MR
PODINGTON SMILED AND LEANING BACKWARD HE LOOKED UP AT THE
BEAUTIFUL BLUE SKY
YOU CAN'T GIVE ME ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS THOMAS SAID HE BUT
YOU NEEDN'T THINK I AM WEAKENING YOU DROVE WITH ME AND I WILL SAIL
WITH YOU
THE THOUGHT CAME INTO BULLER'S MIND THAT HE HAD DONE BOTH OF THESE
THINGS WITH PODINGTON BUT HE DID NOT WISH TO CALL UP UNPLEASANT
MEMORIES AND SAID NOTHING
ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE TOWN THERE STOOD A SMALL COTTAGE WHERE
HOUSE CLEANING WAS GOING ON AND ON A FENCE NOT FAR FROM THE CANAL
THERE HUNG A CARPET GAILY ADORNED WITH STRIPES AND SPOTS OF RED AND
YELLOW
WHEN THE DROWSY TOW HORSE CAME ABREAST OF THE HOUSE AND THE CARPET
CAUGHT HIS EYE HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND GAVE A START TOWARD THE CANAL
THEN IMPRESSED WITH A HORROR OF THE GLARING APPARITION HE GATHERED
HIMSELF UP AND WITH A BOUND DASHED ALONG THE TOW PATH
THE ASTOUNDED
BOY GAVE A SHOUT BUT WAS SPEEDILY LEFT BEHIND
THE BOAT OF MR
BULLER
SHOT FORWARD AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A SQUALL
THE TERRIFIED HORSE SPED ON AS IF A RED AND YELLOW DEMON WERE AFTER
HIM
THE BOAT BOUNDED AND PLUNGED AND FREQUENTLY STRUCK THE GRASSY
BANK OF THE CANAL AS IF IT WOULD BREAK ITSELF TO PIECES
MR
PODINGTON CLUTCHED THE BOOM TO KEEP HIMSELF FROM BEING THROWN OUT
WHILE MR
BULLER BOTH HANDS UPON THE TILLER FRANTICALLY ENDEAVORED
TO KEEP THE BOAT FROM THE BANK
WILLIAM HE SCREAMED HE IS RUNNING AWAY WITH US WE SHALL BE
DASHED TO PIECES CAN'T YOU GET FORWARD AND CAST OFF THAT LINE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED PODINGTON AS THE BOOM GAVE A GREAT JERK AS
IF IT WOULD BREAK ITS FASTENINGS AND DRAG HIM OVERBOARD
I MEAN UNTIE THE TOW LINE
WE'LL BE SMASHED IF YOU DON'T I CAN'T
LEAVE THIS TILLER
DON'T TRY TO STAND UP HOLD ON TO THE BOOM AND
CREEP FORWARD
STEADY NOW OR YOU'LL BE OVERBOARD
MR
PODINGTON STUMBLED TO THE BOW OF THE BOAT HIS EFFORTS GREATLY
IMPEDED BY THE BIG CORK LIFE PRESERVER TIED UNDER HIS ARMS AND THE
MOTION OF THE BOAT WAS SO VIOLENT AND ERRATIC THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO
HOLD ON TO THE MAST WITH ONE ARM AND TO TRY TO LOOSEN THE KNOT WITH
THE OTHER BUT THERE WAS A GREAT STRAIN ON THE ROPE AND HE COULD DO
NOTHING WITH ONE HAND
CUT IT CUT IT CRIED MR
BULLER
I HAVEN'T A KNIFE REPLIED PODINGTON
MR
BULLER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED HIS BOAT WAS CUTTING THROUGH THE
WATER AS NEVER VESSEL OF HER CLASS HAD SPED SINCE SAIL BOATS WERE
INVENTED AND BUMPING AGAINST THE BANK AS IF SHE WERE A BILLIARD BALL
REBOUNDING FROM THE EDGE OF A TABLE
HE FORGOT HE WAS IN A BOAT HE
ONLY KNEW THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS IN A RUNAWAY
HE
LET GO THE TILLER
IT WAS OF NO USE TO HIM
WILLIAM HE CRIED LET US JUMP OUT THE NEXT TIME WE ARE NEAR ENOUGH
TO SHORE
DON'T DO THAT DON'T DO THAT REPLIED PODINGTON
DON'T JUMP OUT IN
A RUNAWAY THAT IS THE WAY TO GET HURT
STICK TO YOUR SEAT MY BOY HE
CAN'T KEEP THIS UP MUCH LONGER
HE'LL LOSE HIS WIND
MR
PODINGTON WAS GREATLY EXCITED BUT HE WAS NOT FRIGHTENED AS
BULLER WAS
HE HAD BEEN IN A RUNAWAY BEFORE AND HE COULD NOT HELP
THINKING HOW MUCH BETTER A WAGON WAS THAN A BOAT IN SUCH A CASE
IF HE WERE HITCHED UP SHORTER AND I HAD A SNAFFLE BIT AND A STOUT
PAIR OF REINS THOUGHT HE I COULD SOON BRING HIM UP
BUT MR
BULLER WAS RAPIDLY LOSING HIS WITS
THE HORSE SEEMED TO BE
GOING FASTER THAN EVER
THE BOAT BUMPED HARDER AGAINST THE BANK AND
AT ONE TIME BULLER THOUGHT THEY COULD TURN OVER
SUDDENLY A THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
WILLIAM HE SHOUTED TIP THAT ANCHOR OVER THE SIDE THROW IT IN
ANY WAY
MR
PODINGTON LOOKED ABOUT HIM AND ALMOST UNDER HIS FEET SAW THE
ANCHOR
HE DID NOT INSTANTLY COMPREHEND WHY BULLER WANTED IT THROWN
OVERBOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT A TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS
THE DIFFICULTIES
IMPOSED BY THE LIFE PRESERVER AND THE NECESSITY OF HOLDING ON WITH
ONE HAND INTERFERED VERY MUCH WITH HIS GETTING AT THE ANCHOR AND
THROWING IT OVER THE SIDE BUT AT LAST HE SUCCEEDED AND JUST AS THE
BOAT THREW UP HER BOW AS IF SHE WERE ABOUT TO JUMP ON SHORE THE
ANCHOR WENT OUT AND ITS LINE SHOT AFTER IT
THERE WAS AN IRREGULAR
TREMBLING OF THE BOAT AS THE ANCHOR STRUGGLED ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE
CANAL THEN THERE WAS A GREAT SHOCK THE BOAT RAN INTO THE BANK AND
STOPPED THE TOW LINE WAS TIGHTENED LIKE A GUITAR STRING AND THE
HORSE JERKED BACK WITH GREAT VIOLENCE CAME TUMBLING IN A HEAP UPON
THE GROUND
INSTANTLY MR
PODINGTON WAS ON THE SHORE AND RUNNING AT THE TOP OF HIS
SPEED TOWARD THE HORSE
THE ASTOUNDED ANIMAL HAD SCARCELY BEGUN TO
STRUGGLE TO HIS FEET WHEN PODINGTON RUSHED UPON HIM PRESSED HIS HEAD
BACK TO THE GROUND AND SAT UPON IT
HURRAH HE CRIED WAVING HIS HAT ABOVE HIS HEAD
GET OUT BULLER
HE IS ALL RIGHT NOW
PRESENTLY MR
BULLER APPROACHED VERY MUCH SHAKEN UP
ALL RIGHT HE SAID
I DON'T CALL A HORSE FLAT IN A ROAD WITH A MAN
ON HIS HEAD ALL RIGHT BUT HOLD HIM DOWN TILL WE GET HIM LOOSE FROM MY
BOAT
THAT IS THE THING TO DO
WILLIAM CAST HIM LOOSE FROM THE BOAT
BEFORE YOU LET HIM UP WHAT WILL HE DO WHEN HE GETS UP
OH
HE'LL BE QUIET ENOUGH WHEN HE GETS UP SAID PODINGTON
BUT IF
YOU'VE GOT A KNIFE YOU CAN CUT HIS TRACES I MEAN THAT ROPE BUT NO
YOU NEEDN'T
HERE COMES THE BOY
WE'LL SETTLE THIS BUSINESS IN VERY
SHORT ORDER NOW
WHEN THE HORSE WAS ON HIS FEET AND ALL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ANIMAL
AND THE BOAT HAD BEEN SEVERED MR
PODINGTON LOOKED AT HIS FRIEND
THOMAS SAID HE YOU SEEM TO HAVE HAD A HARD TIME OF IT
YOU HAVE
LOST YOUR HAT AND YOU LOOK AS IF YOU HAD BEEN IN A WRESTLING MATCH
I HAVE REPLIED THE OTHER I WRESTLED WITH THAT TILLER AND I WONDER
IT DIDN'T THROW ME OUT
NOW APPROACHED THE BOY
SHALL I HITCH HIM ON AGAIN SIR SAID HE
HE'S QUIET ENOUGH NOW
NO CRIED MR
BULLER I WANT NO MORE SAILING AFTER A HORSE AND
BESIDES WE CAN'T GO ON THE LAKE WITH THAT BOAT SHE HAS BEEN BATTERED
ABOUT SO MUCH THAT SHE MUST HAVE OPENED A DOZEN SEAMS
THE BEST THING
WE CAN DO IS TO WALK HOME
MR
PODINGTON AGREED WITH HIS FRIEND THAT WALKING HOME WAS THE BEST
THING THEY COULD DO
THE BOAT WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND TO BE LEAKING
BUT NOT VERY BADLY AND WHEN HER MAST HAD BEEN UNSHIPPED AND
EVERYTHING HAD BEEN MADE TIGHT AND RIGHT ON BOARD SHE WAS PULLED OUT
OF THE WAY OF TOW LINES AND BOATS AND MADE FAST UNTIL SHE COULD BE
SENT FOR FROM THE TOWN
MR
BULLER AND MR
PODINGTON WALKED BACK TOWARD THE TOWN
THEY HAD NOT
GONE VERY FAR WHEN THEY MET A PARTY OF BOYS WHO UPON SEEING THEM
BURST INTO UNSEEMLY LAUGHTER
MISTER CRIED ONE OF THEM YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF TUMBLING INTO
THE CANAL
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF YOUR LIFE PRESERVER AND LET THAT
OTHER MAN PUT IT ON HIS HEAD
THE TWO FRIENDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND COULD NOT HELP JOINING IN THE
LAUGHTER OF THE BOYS
BY GEORGE I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THIS SAID PODINGTON AS HE UNFASTENED
THE CORK JACKET
IT DOES LOOK A LITTLE SUPER TIMID TO WEAR A
LIFE PRESERVER JUST BECAUSE ONE HAPPENS TO BE WALKING BY THE SIDE OF A
CANAL
MR
BULLER TIED A HANDKERCHIEF ON HIS HEAD AND MR
PODINGTON ROLLED
UP HIS LIFE PRESERVER AND CARRIED IT UNDER HIS ARM
THUS THEY REACHED
THE TOWN WHERE BULLER BOUGHT A HAT PODINGTON DISPENSED WITH HIS
BUNDLE AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO BRING BACK THE BOAT
RUNAWAY IN A SAILBOAT EXCLAIMED ONE OF THE CANAL BOATMEN WHEN HE
HAD HEARD ABOUT THE ACCIDENT
UPON MY WORD THAT BEATS ANYTHING THAT
COULD HAPPEN TO A MAN
NO IT DOESN'T REPLIED MR
BULLER QUIETLY
I HAVE GONE TO THE
BOTTOM IN A FOUNDERED ROAD WAGON
THE MAN LOOKED AT HIM FIXEDLY
WAS YOU EVER STRUCK IN THE MUD IN A BALLOON HE ASKED
NOT YET REPLIED MR
BULLER
IT REQUIRED TEN DAYS TO PUT MR
BULLER'S SAILBOAT INTO PROPER
CONDITION AND FOR TEN DAYS MR
PODINGTON STAYED WITH HIS FRIEND AND
ENJOYED HIS VISIT VERY MUCH
THEY STROLLED ON THE BEACH THEY TOOK
LONG WALKS IN THE BACK COUNTRY THEY FISHED FROM THE END OF A PIER
THEY SMOKED THEY TALKED AND WERE HAPPY AND CONTENT
THOMAS SAID MR
PODINGTON ON THE LAST EVENING OF HIS STAY I HAVE
ENJOYED MYSELF VERY MUCH SINCE I HAVE BEEN DOWN HERE AND NOW THOMAS
IF I WERE TO COME DOWN AGAIN NEXT SUMMER WOULD YOU MIND WOULD YOU
MIND NOT
I WOULD NOT MIND IT A BIT REPLIED BULLER PROMPTLY
I'LL NEVER SO
MUCH AS MENTION IT SO YOU CAN COME ALONG WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF IT
AND
SINCE YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO THE SUBJECT WILLIAM HE CONTINUED I'D
LIKE VERY MUCH TO COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN YOU KNOW MY VISIT WAS A VERY
SHORT ONE THIS YEAR
THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY YOU LIVE IN
SUCH A
VARIETY OF SCENERY SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WALKS AND RAMBLES BUT
WILLIAM IF YOU COULD ONLY MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO
OH THAT IS ALL RIGHT EXCLAIMED PODINGTON
I DO NOT NEED TO MAKE
UP MY MIND
YOU COME TO MY HOUSE AND YOU WILL NEVER SO MUCH AS HEAR OF
IT
HERE'S MY HAND UPON IT
AND HERE'S MINE SAID MR
BULLER
AND THEY SHOOK HANDS OVER A NEW COMPACT
COLONEL STARBOTTLE FOR THE PLAINTIFF
BY BRET HARTE 1839 1902
FROM HARPER'S MAGAZINE MARCH 1901
REPUBLISHED IN THE VOLUME
OPENINGS IN THE OLD TRAIL 1902 BY BRET HARTE COPYRIGHT 1902 BY
HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY THE AUTHORIZED PUBLISHERS OF BRET HARTE'S
COMPLETE WORKS REPRINTED BY THEIR PERMISSION
IT HAD BEEN A DAY OF TRIUMPH FOR COLONEL STARBOTTLE
FIRST FOR HIS
PERSONALITY AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO SEPARATE THE COLONEL'S
ACHIEVEMENTS FROM HIS INDIVIDUALITY SECOND FOR HIS ORATORICAL
ABILITIES AS A SYMPATHETIC PLEADER AND THIRD FOR HIS FUNCTIONS AS
THE LEADING COUNSEL FOR THE EUREKA DITCH COMPANY VERSUS THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA
ON HIS STRICTLY LEGAL PERFORMANCES IN THIS ISSUE I PREFER
NOT TO SPEAK THERE WERE THOSE WHO DENIED THEM ALTHOUGH THE JURY HAD
ACCEPTED THEM IN THE FACE OF THE RULING OF THE HALF AMUSED
HALF CYNICAL JUDGE HIMSELF
FOR AN HOUR THEY HAD LAUGHED WITH THE
COLONEL WEPT WITH HIM BEEN STIRRED TO PERSONAL INDIGNATION OR
PATRIOTIC EXALTATION BY HIS PASSIONATE AND LOFTY PERIODS WHAT ELSE
COULD THEY DO THAN GIVE HIM THEIR VERDICT IF IT WAS ALLEGED BY SOME
THAT THE AMERICAN EAGLE THOMAS JEFFERSON AND THE RESOLUTIONS OF '98
HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE CONTEST OF A DITCH COMPANY OVER A
DOUBTFULLY WORDED LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENT THAT WHOLESALE ABUSE OF THE
STATE ATTORNEY AND HIS POLITICAL MOTIVES HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST
CONNECTION WITH THE LEGAL QUESTION RAISED IT WAS NEVERTHELESS
GENERALLY ACCEPTED THAT THE LOSING PARTY WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY TOO GLAD
TO HAVE THE COLONEL ON THEIR SIDE
AND COLONEL STARBOTTLE KNEW THIS
AS PERSPIRING FLORID AND PANTING HE REBUTTONED THE LOWER BUTTONS
OF HIS BLUE FROCK COAT WHICH HAD BECOME LOOSED IN AN ORATORICAL
SPASM AND READJUSTED HIS OLD FASHIONED SPOTLESS SHIRT FRILL ABOVE IT
AS HE STRUTTED FROM THE COURT ROOM AMIDST THE HAND SHAKINGS AND
ACCLAMATIONS OF HIS FRIENDS
AND HERE AN UNPRECEDENTED THING OCCURRED
THE COLONEL ABSOLUTELY
DECLINED SPIRITUOUS REFRESHMENT AT THE NEIGHBORING PALMETTO SALOON
AND DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF PROCEEDING DIRECTLY TO HIS OFFICE IN THE
ADJOINING SQUARE
NEVERTHELESS THE COLONEL QUITTED THE BUILDING ALONE
AND APPARENTLY UNARMED EXCEPT FOR HIS FAITHFUL GOLD HEADED STICK
WHICH HUNG AS USUAL FROM HIS FOREARM
THE CROWD GAZED AFTER HIM WITH
UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION OF THIS NEW EVIDENCE OF HIS PLUCK
IT WAS
REMEMBERED ALSO THAT A MYSTERIOUS NOTE HAD BEEN HANDED TO HIM AT THE
CONCLUSION OF HIS SPEECH EVIDENTLY A CHALLENGE FROM THE STATE
ATTORNEY
IT WAS QUITE PLAIN THAT THE COLONEL A PRACTISED
DUELLIST WAS HASTENING HOME TO ANSWER IT
BUT HEREIN THEY WERE WRONG
THE NOTE WAS IN A FEMALE HAND AND SIMPLY
REQUESTED THE COLONEL TO ACCORD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE WRITER AT THE
COLONEL'S OFFICE AS SOON AS HE LEFT THE COURT
BUT IT WAS AN
ENGAGEMENT THAT THE COLONEL AS DEVOTED TO THE FAIR SEX AS HE WAS TO
THE CODE WAS NO LESS PROMPT IN ACCEPTING
HE FLICKED AWAY THE DUST
FROM HIS SPOTLESS WHITE TROUSERS AND VARNISHED BOOTS WITH HIS
HANDKERCHIEF AND SETTLED HIS BLACK CRAVAT UNDER HIS BYRON COLLAR AS
HE NEARED HIS OFFICE
HE WAS SURPRISED HOWEVER ON OPENING THE DOOR
OF HIS PRIVATE OFFICE TO FIND HIS VISITOR ALREADY THERE HE WAS STILL
MORE STARTLED TO FIND HER SOMEWHAT PAST MIDDLE AGE AND PLAINLY
ATTIRED
BUT THE COLONEL WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SCHOOL OF SOUTHERN
POLITENESS ALREADY ANTIQUE IN THE REPUBLIC AND HIS BOW OF COURTESY
BELONGED TO THE EPOCH OF HIS SHIRT FRILL AND STRAPPED TROUSERS
NO ONE
COULD HAVE DETECTED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS MANNER ALBEIT HIS
SENTENCES WERE SHORT AND INCOMPLETE
BUT THE COLONEL'S COLLOQUIAL
SPEECH WAS APT TO BE FRAGMENTARY INCOHERENCIES OF HIS LARGER
ORATORICAL UTTERANCES
A THOUSAND PARDONS FOR ER HAVING KEPT A LADY WAITING ER
BUT ER CONGRATULATIONS OF FRIENDS AND ER COURTESY DUE TO
THEM ER INTERFERED WITH THOUGH PERHAPS ONLY HEIGHTENED BY
PROCRASTINATION PLEASURE OF HA AND THE COLONEL COMPLETED HIS
SENTENCE WITH A GALLANT WAVE OF HIS FAT BUT WHITE AND WELL KEPT HAND
YES I CAME TO SEE YOU ALONG O' THAT SPEECH OF YOURS
I WAS IN COURT
WHEN I HEARD YOU GETTIN' IT OFF ON THAT JURY I SAYS TO MYSELF THAT'S
THE KIND O' LAWYER I WANT
A MAN THAT'S FLOWERY AND CONVINCIN' JUST
THE MAN TO TAKE UP OUR CASE
AH IT'S A MATTER OF BUSINESS I SEE SAID THE COLONEL INWARDLY
RELIEVED BUT EXTERNALLY CARELESS
AND ER MAY I ASK THE NATURE OF
THE CASE
WELL IT'S A BREACH O' PROMISE SUIT SAID THE VISITOR CALMLY
IF THE COLONEL HAD BEEN SURPRISED BEFORE HE WAS NOW REALLY STARTLED
AND WITH AN ADDED HORROR THAT REQUIRED ALL HIS POLITENESS TO CONCEAL
BREACH OF PROMISE CASES WERE HIS PECULIAR AVERSION
HE HAD ALWAYS HELD
THEM TO BE A KIND OF LITIGATION WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN OBVIATED BY THE
PROMPT KILLING OF THE MASCULINE OFFENDER IN WHICH CASE HE WOULD HAVE
GLADLY DEFENDED THE KILLER
BUT A SUIT FOR DAMAGES DAMAGES WITH
THE READING OF LOVE LETTERS BEFORE A HILARIOUS JURY AND COURT WAS
AGAINST ALL HIS INSTINCTS
HIS CHIVALRY WAS OUTRAGED HIS SENSE OF
HUMOR WAS SMALL AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER HE HAD LOST ONE OR
TWO IMPORTANT CASES THROUGH AN UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT OF THIS QUALITY
IN A JURY
THE WOMAN HAD EVIDENTLY NOTICED HIS HESITATION BUT MISTOOK ITS CAUSE
IT AIN'T ME BUT MY DARTER
THE COLONEL RECOVERED HIS POLITENESS
AH I AM RELIEVED MY DEAR
MADAM I COULD HARDLY CONCEIVE A MAN IGNORANT ENOUGH TO ER ER THROW
AWAY SUCH EVIDENT GOOD FORTUNE OR BASE ENOUGH TO DECEIVE THE
TRUSTFULNESS OF WOMANHOOD MATURED AND EXPERIENCED ONLY IN THE
CHIVALRY OF OUR SEX HA
THE WOMAN SMILED GRIMLY
YES IT'S MY DARTER ZAIDEE HOOKER SO YE
MIGHT SPARE SOME OF THEM PRETTY SPEECHES FOR HER BEFORE THE JURY
THE COLONEL WINCED SLIGHTLY BEFORE THIS DOUBTFUL PROSPECT BUT
SMILED
HA YES CERTAINLY THE JURY
BUT ER MY DEAR LADY NEED
WE GO AS FAR AS THAT CANNOT THIS AFFAIR BE SETTLED ER OUT OF
COURT COULD NOT THIS ER INDIVIDUAL BE ADMONISHED TOLD THAT HE
MUST GIVE SATISFACTION PERSONAL SATISFACTION FOR HIS DASTARDLY
CONDUCT TO ER NEAR RELATIVE OR EVEN VALUED PERSONAL FRIEND
THE ER ARRANGEMENTS NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE I MYSELF WOULD
UNDERTAKE
HE WAS QUITE SINCERE INDEED HIS SMALL BLACK EYES SHONE WITH THAT
FIRE WHICH A PRETTY WOMAN OR AN AFFAIR OF HONOR COULD ALONE KINDLE
THE VISITOR STARED VACANTLY AT HIM AND SAID SLOWLY
AND WHAT GOOD IS THAT GOIN' TO DO US
COMPEL HIM TO ER PERFORM HIS PROMISE SAID THE COLONEL LEANING
BACK IN HIS CHAIR
KETCH HIM DOIN' IT SAID THE WOMAN SCORNFULLY
NO THAT AIN'T WOT
WE'RE AFTER
WE MUST MAKE HIM PAY DAMAGES AND NOTHIN' SHORT O'
THAT
THE COLONEL BIT HIS LIP
I SUPPOSE HE SAID GLOOMILY YOU HAVE
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE WRITTEN PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS ER ER
LOVE LETTERS IN FACT
NO NARY A LETTER YE SEE THAT'S JEST IT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU
COME IN
YOU'VE GOT TO CONVINCE THAT JURY YOURSELF
YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW
WHAT IT IS TELL THE WHOLE STORY YOUR OWN WAY
LORD TO A MAN LIKE YOU
THAT'S NOTHIN'
STARTLING AS THIS ADMISSION MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO ANY OTHER LAWYER
STARBOTTLE WAS ABSOLUTELY RELIEVED BY IT
THE ABSENCE OF ANY
MIRTH PROVOKING CORRESPONDENCE AND THE APPEAL SOLELY TO HIS OWN
POWERS OF PERSUASION ACTUALLY STRUCK HIS FANCY
HE LIGHTLY PUT ASIDE
THE COMPLIMENT WITH A WAVE OF HIS WHITE HAND
OF COURSE SAID THE COLONEL CONFIDENTLY THERE IS STRONGLY
PRESUMPTIVE AND CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE PERHAPS YOU CAN GIVE ME ER A
BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE AFFAIR
ZAIDEE KIN DO THAT STRAIGHT ENOUGH I RECKON SAID THE WOMAN WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW FIRST IS KIN YOU TAKE THE CASE
THE COLONEL DID NOT HESITATE HIS CURIOSITY WAS PIQUED
I CERTAINLY
CAN
I HAVE NO DOUBT YOUR DAUGHTER WILL PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF
SUFFICIENT FACTS AND DETAILS TO CONSTITUTE WHAT WE CALL ER A
BRIEF
SHE KIN BE BRIEF ENOUGH OR LONG ENOUGH FOR THE MATTER OF THAT
SAID THE WOMAN RISING
THE COLONEL ACCEPTED THIS IMPLIED WITTICISM
WITH A SMILE
AND WHEN MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER HE ASKED POLITELY
WELL I RECKON AS SOON AS I CAN TROT OUT AND CALL HER
SHE'S JUST
OUTSIDE MEANDERIN' IN THE ROAD KINDER SHY YE KNOW AT FIRST
SHE WALKED TO THE DOOR
THE ASTOUNDED COLONEL NEVERTHELESS GALLANTLY
ACCOMPANIED HER AS SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE STREET AND CALLED
SHRILLY YOU ZAIDEE
A YOUNG GIRL HERE APPARENTLY DETACHED HERSELF FROM A TREE AND THE
OSTENTATIOUS PERUSAL OF AN OLD ELECTION POSTER AND SAUNTERED DOWN
TOWARDS THE OFFICE DOOR
LIKE HER MOTHER SHE WAS PLAINLY DRESSED
UNLIKE HER SHE HAD A PALE RATHER REFINED FACE WITH A DEMURE MOUTH
AND DOWNCAST EYES
THIS WAS ALL THE COLONEL SAW AS HE BOWED PROFOUNDLY
AND LED THE WAY INTO HIS OFFICE FOR SHE ACCEPTED HIS SALUTATIONS
WITHOUT LIFTING HER HEAD
HE HELPED HER GALLANTLY TO A CHAIR ON WHICH
SHE SEATED HERSELF SIDEWAYS SOMEWHAT CEREMONIOUSLY WITH HER EYES
FOLLOWING THE POINT OF HER PARASOL AS SHE TRACED A PATTERN ON THE
CARPET
A SECOND CHAIR OFFERED TO THE MOTHER THAT LADY HOWEVER
DECLINED
I RECKON TO LEAVE YOU AND ZAIDEE TOGETHER TO TALK IT OUT
SHE SAID TURNING TO HER DAUGHTER SHE ADDED JEST YOU TELL HIM ALL
ZAIDEE AND BEFORE THE COLONEL COULD RISE AGAIN DISAPPEARED FROM THE
ROOM
IN SPITE OF HIS PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE STARBOTTLE WAS FOR A
MOMENT EMBARRASSED
THE YOUNG GIRL HOWEVER BROKE THE SILENCE WITHOUT
LOOKING UP
ADONIRAM K
HOTCHKISS SHE BEGAN IN A MONOTONOUS VOICE AS IF IT
WERE A RECITATION ADDRESSED TO THE PUBLIC FIRST BEGAN TO TAKE NOTICE
OF ME A YEAR AGO
ARTER THAT OFF AND ON
ONE MOMENT INTERRUPTED THE ASTOUNDED COLONEL DO YOU MEAN
HOTCHKISS THE PRESIDENT OF THE DITCH COMPANY HE HAD RECOGNIZED THE
NAME OF A PROMINENT CITIZEN A RIGID ASCETIC TACITURN MIDDLE AGED
MAN A DEACON AND MORE THAN THAT THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY HE HAD JUST
DEFENDED
IT SEEMED INCONCEIVABLE
THAT'S HIM SHE CONTINUED WITH EYES STILL FIXED ON THE PARASOL AND
WITHOUT CHANGING HER MONOTONOUS TONE OFF AND ON EVER SINCE
MOST OF
THE TIME AT THE FREE WILL BAPTIST CHURCH AT MORNING SERVICE
PRAYER MEETINGS AND SUCH
AND AT HOME OUTSIDE ER IN THE ROAD
IS IT THIS GENTLEMAN MR
ADONIRAM K
HOTCHKISS WHO ER PROMISED
MARRIAGE STAMMERED THE COLONEL
YES
THE COLONEL SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR
MOST EXTRAORDINARY
FOR YOU SEE MY DEAR YOUNG LADY THIS BECOMES A ER MOST DELICATE
AFFAIR
THAT'S WHAT MAW SAID RETURNED THE YOUNG WOMAN SIMPLY YET WITH THE
FAINTEST SMILE PLAYING AROUND HER DEMURE LIPS AND DOWNCAST CHEEK
I MEAN SAID THE COLONEL WITH A PAINED YET COURTEOUS SMILE THAT
THIS ER GENTLEMAN IS IN FACT ER ONE OF MY CLIENTS
THAT'S WHAT MAW SAID TOO AND OF COURSE YOUR KNOWING HIM WILL MAKE
IT ALL THE EASIER FOR YOU SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN
A SLIGHT FLUSH CROSSED THE COLONEL'S CHEEK AS HE RETURNED QUICKLY AND
A LITTLE STIFFLY ON THE CONTRARY ER IT MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR
ME TO ER ACT IN THIS MATTER
THE GIRL LIFTED HER EYES
THE COLONEL HELD HIS BREATH AS THE LONG
LASHES WERE RAISED TO HIS LEVEL
EVEN TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER THAT
SUDDEN REVELATION OF HER EYES SEEMED TO TRANSFORM HER FACE WITH SUBTLE
WITCHERY
THEY WERE LARGE BROWN AND SOFT YET FILLED WITH AN
EXTRAORDINARY PENETRATION AND PRESCIENCE
THEY WERE THE EYES OF AN
EXPERIENCED WOMAN OF THIRTY FIXED IN THE FACE OF A CHILD
WHAT ELSE
THE COLONEL SAW THERE HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS HE FELT HIS INMOST SECRETS
PLUCKED FROM HIM HIS WHOLE SOUL LAID BARE HIS VANITY BELLIGERENCY
GALLANTRY EVEN HIS MEDIEVAL CHIVALRY PENETRATED AND YET
ILLUMINATED IN THAT SINGLE GLANCE
AND WHEN THE EYELIDS FELL AGAIN
HE FELT THAT A GREATER PART OF HIMSELF HAD BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THEM
I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID HURRIEDLY
I MEAN THIS MATTER MAY BE
ARRANGED ER AMICABLY
MY INTEREST WITH AND AS YOU WISELY
SAY MY ER KNOWLEDGE OF MY CLIENT ER MR
HOTCHKISS MAY AFFECT A
COMPROMISE
AND DAMAGES SAID THE YOUNG GIRL READDRESSING HER PARASOL AS IF
SHE HAD NEVER LOOKED UP
THE COLONEL WINCED
AND ER UNDOUBTEDLY COMPENSATION IF YOU DO
NOT PRESS A FULFILMENT OF THE PROMISE
UNLESS HE SAID WITH AN
ATTEMPTED RETURN TO HIS FORMER EASY GALLANTRY WHICH HOWEVER THE
RECOLLECTION OF HER EYES MADE DIFFICULT IT IS A QUESTION OF ER THE
AFFECTIONS
WHICH SAID HIS FAIR CLIENT SOFTLY
IF YOU STILL LOVE HIM EXPLAINED THE COLONEL ACTUALLY BLUSHING
ZAIDEE AGAIN LOOKED UP AGAIN TAKING THE COLONEL'S BREATH AWAY WITH
EYES THAT EXPRESSED NOT ONLY THE FULLEST PERCEPTION OF WHAT HE HAD
SAID BUT OF WHAT HE THOUGHT AND HAD NOT SAID AND WITH AN ADDED
SUBTLE SUGGESTION OF WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
THAT'S TELLIN' SHE
SAID DROPPING HER LONG LASHES AGAIN
THE COLONEL LAUGHED VACANTLY
THEN FEELING HIMSELF GROWING IMBECILE HE FORCED AN EQUALLY WEAK
GRAVITY
PARDON ME I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE NO LETTERS MAY I KNOW THE
WAY IN WHICH HE FORMULATED HIS DECLARATION AND PROMISES
HYMN BOOKS SAID THE GIRL BRIEFLY
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID THE MYSTIFIED LAWYER
HYMN BOOKS MARKED WORDS IN THEM WITH PENCIL AND PASSED 'EM ON TO
ME REPEATED ZAIDEE
LIKE 'LOVE 'DEAR 'PRECIOUS 'SWEET AND
'BLESSED SHE ADDED ACCENTING EACH WORD WITH A PUSH OF HER PARASOL
ON THE CARPET
SOMETIMES A WHOLE LINE OUTER TATE AND BRADY AND
SOLOMON'S SONG YOU KNOW AND SICH
I BELIEVE SAID THE COLONEL LOFTILY THAT THE ER PHRASES OF
SACRED PSALMODY LEND THEMSELVES TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE AFFECTIONS
BUT
IN REGARD TO THE DISTINCT PROMISE OF MARRIAGE WAS THERE ER NO
OTHER EXPRESSION
MARRIAGE SERVICE IN THE PRAYER BOOK LINES AND WORDS OUTER THAT ALL
MARKED SAID ZAIDEE
THE COLONEL NODDED NATURALLY AND APPROVINGLY
VERY GOOD
WERE OTHERS COGNIZANT OF THIS WERE THERE ANY WITNESSES
OF COURSE NOT SAID THE GIRL
ONLY ME AND HIM
IT WAS GENERALLY AT
CHURCH TIME OR PRAYER MEETING
ONCE IN PASSING THE PLATE HE SLIPPED
ONE O' THEM PEPPERMINT LOZENGES WITH THE LETTERS STAMPED ON IT 'I LOVE
YOU' FOR ME TO TAKE
THE COLONEL COUGHED SLIGHTLY
AND YOU HAVE THE LOZENGE
I ATE IT SAID THE GIRL SIMPLY
AH SAID THE COLONEL
AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED DELICATELY
BUT WERE THESE ATTENTIONS ER CONFINED TO ER SACRED PRECINCTS
DID HE MEET YOU ELSEWHERE
USETER PASS OUR HOUSE ON THE ROAD RETURNED THE GIRL DROPPING INTO
HER MONOTONOUS RECITAL AND USETER SIGNAL
AH SIGNAL REPEATED THE COLONEL APPROVINGLY
YES HE'D SAY 'KERROW AND I'D SAY 'KERREE SUTHING LIKE A BIRD
YOU KNOW
INDEED AS SHE LIFTED HER VOICE IN IMITATION OF THE CALL THE COLONEL
THOUGHT IT CERTAINLY VERY SWEET AND BIRDLIKE
AT LEAST AS SHE GAVE
IT
WITH HIS REMEMBRANCE OF THE GRIM DEACON HE HAD DOUBTS AS TO THE
MELODIOUSNESS OF HIS UTTERANCE
HE GRAVELY MADE HER REPEAT IT
AND AFTER THAT SIGNAL HE ADDED SUGGESTIVELY
HE'D PASS ON SAID THE GIRL
THE COLONEL COUGHED SLIGHTLY AND TAPPED HIS DESK WITH HIS PEN HOLDER
WERE THERE ANY ENDEARMENTS ER CARESSES ER SUCH AS TAKING YOUR
HAND ER CLASPING YOUR WAIST HE SUGGESTED WITH A GALLANT YET
RESPECTFUL SWEEP OF HIS WHITE HAND AND BOWING OF HIS HEAD ER
SLIGHT PRESSURE OF YOUR FINGERS IN THE CHANGES OF A DANCE I MEAN
HE CORRECTED HIMSELF WITH AN APOLOGETIC COUGH IN THE PASSING OF
THE PLATE
NO HE WAS NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL 'FOND RETURNED THE GIRL
AH ADONIRAM K
HOTCHKISS WAS NOT 'FOND' IN THE ORDINARY ACCEPTANCE
OF THE WORD SAID THE COLONEL WITH PROFESSIONAL GRAVITY
SHE LIFTED HER DISTURBING EYES AND AGAIN ABSORBED HIS IN HER OWN
SHE
ALSO SAID YES ALTHOUGH HER EYES IN THEIR MYSTERIOUS PRESCIENCE OF
ALL HE WAS THINKING DISCLAIMED THE NECESSITY OF ANY ANSWER AT ALL
HE
SMILED VACANTLY
THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE
ON WHICH SHE SLOWLY
DISENGAGED HER PARASOL FROM THE CARPET PATTERN AND STOOD UP
I RECKON THAT'S ABOUT ALL SHE SAID
ER YES BUT ONE MOMENT SAID THE COLONEL VAGUELY
HE WOULD HAVE
LIKED TO KEEP HER LONGER BUT WITH HER STRANGE PREMONITION OF HIM HE
FELT POWERLESS TO DETAIN HER OR EXPLAIN HIS REASON FOR DOING SO
HE
INSTINCTIVELY KNEW SHE HAD TOLD HIM ALL HIS PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT
TOLD HIM THAT A MORE HOPELESS CASE HAD NEVER COME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE
YET HE WAS NOT DAUNTED ONLY EMBARRASSED
NO MATTER HE SAID
VAGUELY
OF COURSE I SHALL HAVE TO CONSULT WITH YOU AGAIN HER EYES
AGAIN ANSWERED THAT SHE EXPECTED HE WOULD BUT SHE ADDED SIMPLY
WHEN
IN THE COURSE OF A DAY OR TWO SAID THE COLONEL QUICKLY
I WILL
SEND YOU WORD SHE TURNED TO GO
IN HIS EAGERNESS TO OPEN THE DOOR
FOR HER HE UPSET HIS CHAIR AND WITH SOME CONFUSION THAT WAS ACTUALLY
YOUTHFUL HE ALMOST IMPEDED HER MOVEMENTS IN THE HALL AND KNOCKED HIS
BROAD BRIMMED PANAMA HAT FROM HIS BOWING HAND IN A FINAL GALLANT
SWEEP
YET AS HER SMALL TRIM YOUTHFUL FIGURE WITH ITS SIMPLE
LEGHORN STRAW HAT CONFINED BY A BLUE BOW UNDER HER ROUND CHIN PASSED
AWAY BEFORE HIM SHE LOOKED MORE LIKE A CHILD THAN EVER
THE COLONEL SPENT THAT AFTERNOON IN MAKING DIPLOMATIC INQUIRIES
HE
FOUND HIS YOUTHFUL CLIENT WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A WIDOW WHO HAD A SMALL
RANCH ON THE CROSS ROADS NEAR THE NEW FREE WILL BAPTIST CHURCH THE
EVIDENT THEATRE OF THIS PASTORAL
THEY LED A SECLUDED LIFE THE GIRL
BEING LITTLE KNOWN IN THE TOWN AND HER BEAUTY AND FASCINATION
APPARENTLY NOT YET BEING A RECOGNIZED FACT
THE COLONEL FELT A
PLEASURABLE RELIEF AT THIS AND A GENERAL SATISFACTION HE COULD NOT
ACCOUNT FOR
HIS FEW INQUIRIES CONCERNING MR
HOTCHKISS ONLY CONFIRMED
HIS OWN IMPRESSIONS OF THE ALLEGED LOVER A SERIOUS MINDED
PRACTICALLY ABSTRACTED MAN ABSTENTIVE OF YOUTHFUL SOCIETY AND THE
LAST MAN APPARENTLY CAPABLE OF LEVITY OF THE AFFECTIONS OR SERIOUS
FLIRTATION
THE COLONEL WAS MYSTIFIED BUT DETERMINED OF
PURPOSE WHATEVER THAT PURPOSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE NEXT DAY HE WAS AT HIS OFFICE AT THE SAME HOUR
HE WAS ALONE AS
USUAL THE COLONEL'S OFFICE REALLY BEING HIS PRIVATE LODGINGS
DISPOSED IN CONNECTING ROOMS A SINGLE APARTMENT RESERVED FOR
CONSULTATION
HE HAD NO CLERK HIS PAPERS AND BRIEFS BEING TAKEN BY
HIS FAITHFUL BODY SERVANT AND EX SLAVE JIM TO ANOTHER FIRM WHO DID
HIS OFFICE WORK SINCE THE DEATH OF MAJOR STRYKER THE COLONEL'S ONLY
LAW PARTNER WHO FELL IN A DUEL SOME YEARS PREVIOUS
WITH A FINE
CONSTANCY THE COLONEL STILL RETAINED HIS PARTNER'S NAME ON HIS
DOOR PLATE AND IT WAS ALLEGED BY THE SUPERSTITIOUS KEPT A CERTAIN
INVINCIBILITY ALSO THROUGH THE MANES OF THAT LAMENTED AND SOMEWHAT
FEARED MAN
THE COLONEL CONSULTED HIS WATCH WHOSE HEAVY GOLD CASE STILL SHOWED
THE MARKS OF A PROVIDENTIAL INTERFERENCE WITH A BULLET DESTINED FOR
ITS OWNER AND REPLACED IT WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND SHORTNESS OF
BREATH IN HIS FOB
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE HEARD A STEP IN THE PASSAGE
AND THE DOOR OPENED TO ADONIRAM K
HOTCHKISS
THE COLONEL WAS
IMPRESSED HE HAD A DUELLIST'S RESPECT FOR PUNCTUALITY
THE MAN ENTERED WITH A NOD AND THE EXPECTANT INQUIRING LOOK OF A BUSY
MAN
AS HIS FEET CROSSED THAT SACRED THRESHOLD THE COLONEL BECAME ALL
COURTESY HE PLACED A CHAIR FOR HIS VISITOR AND TOOK HIS HAT FROM HIS
HALF RELUCTANT HAND
HE THEN OPENED A CUPBOARD AND BROUGHT OUT A
BOTTLE OF WHISKEY AND TWO GLASSES
A ER SLIGHT REFRESHMENT MR
HOTCHKISS HE SUGGESTED POLITELY
I
NEVER DRINK REPLIED HOTCHKISS WITH THE SEVERE ATTITUDE OF A TOTAL
ABSTAINER
AH ER NOT THE FINEST BOURBON WHISKEY SELECTED BY A
KENTUCKY FRIEND NO PARDON ME A CIGAR THEN THE MILDEST HAVANA
I DO NOT USE TOBACCO NOR ALCOHOL IN ANY FORM REPEATED HOTCHKISS
ASCETICALLY
I HAVE NO FOOLISH WEAKNESSES
THE COLONEL'S MOIST BEADY EYES SWEPT SILENTLY OVER HIS CLIENT'S
SALLOW FACE
HE LEANED BACK COMFORTABLY IN HIS CHAIR AND HALF
CLOSING HIS EYES AS IN DREAMY REMINISCENCE SAID SLOWLY YOUR
REPLY MR
HOTCHKISS REMINDS ME OF ER SING'LAR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT
ER OCCURRED IN POINT OF FACT AT THE ST
CHARLES HOTEL NEW
ORLEANS
PINKEY HORNBLOWER PERSONAL FRIEND INVITED SENATOR
DOOLITTLE TO JOIN HIM IN SOCIAL GLASS
RECEIVED SING'LARLY ENOUGH
REPLY SIMILAR TO YOURS
'DON'T DRINK NOR SMOKE SAID PINKEY
'GAD
SIR YOU MUST BE MIGHTY SWEET ON THE LADIES HA THE COLONEL PAUSED
LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FAINT FLUSH TO PASS FROM HOTCHKISS'S CHEEK
AND WENT ON HALF CLOSING HIS EYES 'I ALLOW NO MAN SIR TO DISCUSS
MY PERSONAL HABITS SAID DOOLITTLE OVER HIS SHIRT COLLAR
'THEN I
RECKON SHOOTIN' MUST BE ONE OF THOSE HABITS SAID PINKEY COOLLY
BOTH MEN DROVE OUT ON THE SHELL ROAD BACK OF CEMETERY NEXT MORNING
PINKEY PUT BULLET AT TWELVE PACES THROUGH DOOLITTLE'S TEMPLE
POOR
DOO NEVER SPOKE AGAIN
LEFT THREE WIVES AND SEVEN CHILDREN THEY SAY
TWO OF 'EM BLACK
I GOT A NOTE FROM YOU THIS MORNING SAID HOTCHKISS WITH BADLY
CONCEALED IMPATIENCE
I SUPPOSE IN REFERENCE TO OUR CASE
YOU HAVE
TAKEN JUDGMENT I BELIEVE THE COLONEL WITHOUT REPLYING SLOWLY
FILLED A GLASS OF WHISKEY AND WATER
FOR A MOMENT HE HELD IT DREAMILY
BEFORE HIM AS IF STILL ENGAGED IN GENTLE REMINISCENCES CALLED UP BY
THE ACT
THEN TOSSING IT OFF HE WIPED HIS LIPS WITH A LARGE WHITE
HANDKERCHIEF AND LEANING BACK COMFORTABLY IN HIS CHAIR SAID WITH A
WAVE OF HIS HAND THE INTERVIEW I REQUESTED MR
HOTCHKISS CONCERNS
A SUBJECT WHICH I MAY SAY IS ER ER AT PRESENT NOT OF A PUBLIC
OR BUSINESS NATURE ALTHOUGH LATER IT MIGHT BECOME ER ER BOTH
IT IS AN AFFAIR OF SOME ER DELICACY
THE COLONEL PAUSED AND MR
HOTCHKISS REGARDED HIM WITH INCREASED
IMPATIENCE
THE COLONEL HOWEVER CONTINUED WITH UNCHANGED
DELIBERATION IT CONCERNS ER A YOUNG LADY A BEAUTIFUL
HIGH SOULED CREATURE SIR WHO APART FROM HER PERSONAL LOVELINESS
ER ER I MAY SAY IS OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAMILIES OF MISSOURI AND
ER NOT REMOTELY CONNECTED BY MARRIAGE WITH ONE OF ER ER MY
BOYHOOD'S DEAREST FRIENDS
THE LATTER I GRIEVE TO SAY WAS A PURE
INVENTION OF THE COLONEL'S AN ORATORICAL ADDITION TO THE SCANTY
INFORMATION HE HAD OBTAINED THE PREVIOUS DAY
THE YOUNG LADY HE
CONTINUED BLANDLY ENJOYS THE FURTHER DISTINCTION OF BEING THE
OBJECT OF SUCH ATTENTION FROM YOU AS WOULD MAKE THIS INTERVIEW
REALLY A CONFIDENTIAL MATTER ER ER AMONG FRIENDS AND ER ER
RELATIONS IN PRESENT AND FUTURE
I NEED NOT SAY THAT THE LADY I REFER
TO IS MISS ZAIDEE JUNO HOOKER ONLY DAUGHTER OF ALMIRA ANN HOOKER
RELICT OF JEFFERSON BROWN HOOKER FORMERLY OF BOONE COUNTY KENTUCKY
AND LATTERLY OF ER PIKE COUNTY MISSOURI
THE SALLOW ASCETIC HUE OF MR
HOTCHKISS'S FACE HAD PASSED THROUGH A
LIVID AND THEN A GREENISH SHADE AND FINALLY SETTLED INTO A SULLEN
RED
WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT HE DEMANDED ROUGHLY
THE LEAST TOUCH OF
BELLIGERENT FIRE CAME INTO STARBOTTLE'S EYE BUT HIS BLAND COURTESY
DID NOT CHANGE
I BELIEVE HE SAID POLITELY I HAVE MADE MYSELF
CLEAR AS BETWEEN ER GENTLEMEN THOUGH PERHAPS NOT AS CLEAR AS I
SHOULD TO ER ER JURY
MR
HOTCHKISS WAS APPARENTLY STRUCK WITH SOME SIGNIFICANCE IN THE
LAWYER'S REPLY
I DON'T KNOW HE SAID IN A LOWER AND MORE CAUTIOUS
VOICE WHAT YOU MEAN BY WHAT YOU CALL 'MY ATTENTIONS' TO ANY ONE OR
HOW IT CONCERNS YOU
I HAVE NOT EXHAUSTED HALF A DOZEN WORDS WITH THE
PERSON YOU NAME HAVE NEVER WRITTEN HER A LINE NOR EVEN CALLED AT HER
HOUSE HE ROSE WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF EASE PULLED DOWN HIS WAISTCOAT
BUTTONED HIS COAT AND TOOK UP HIS HAT
THE COLONEL DID NOT MOVE
I
BELIEVE I HAVE ALREADY INDICATED MY MEANING IN WHAT I HAVE CALLED
'YOUR ATTENTIONS SAID THE COLONEL BLANDLY AND GIVEN YOU MY
'CONCERN' FOR SPEAKING AS ER ER MUTUAL FRIEND
AS TO YOUR
STATEMENT OF YOUR RELATIONS WITH MISS HOOKER I MAY STATE THAT IT IS
FULLY CORROBORATED BY THE STATEMENT OF THE YOUNG LADY HERSELF IN THIS
VERY OFFICE YESTERDAY
THEN WHAT DOES THIS IMPERTINENT NONSENSE MEAN WHY AM I SUMMONED
HERE SAID HOTCHKISS FURIOUSLY
BECAUSE SAID THE COLONEL DELIBERATELY THAT STATEMENT IS
INFAMOUSLY YES DAMNABLY TO YOUR DISCREDIT SIR
MR
HOTCHKISS WAS HERE SEIZED BY ONE OF THOSE IMPORTANT AND
INCONSISTENT RAGES WHICH OCCASIONALLY BETRAY THE HABITUALLY CAUTIOUS
AND TIMID MAN
HE CAUGHT UP THE COLONEL'S STICK WHICH WAS LYING ON
THE TABLE
AT THE SAME MOMENT THE COLONEL WITHOUT ANY APPARENT
EFFORT GRASPED IT BY THE HANDLE
TO MR
HOTCHKISS'S ASTONISHMENT THE
STICK SEPARATED IN TWO PIECES LEAVING THE HANDLE AND ABOUT TWO FEET
OF NARROW GLITTERING STEEL IN THE COLONEL'S HAND
THE MAN RECOILED
DROPPING THE USELESS FRAGMENT
THE COLONEL PICKED IT UP FITTING THE
SHINING BLADE IN IT CLICKED THE SPRING AND THEN RISING WITH A FACE
OF COURTESY YET OF UNMISTAKABLY GENUINE PAIN AND WITH EVEN A SLIGHT
TREMOR IN HIS VOICE SAID GRAVELY
MR
HOTCHKISS I OWE YOU A THOUSAND APOLOGIES SIR THAT ER
A WEAPON SHOULD BE DRAWN BY ME EVEN THROUGH YOUR OWN INADVERTENCE
UNDER THE SACRED PROTECTION OF MY ROOF AND UPON AN UNARMED MAN
I
BEG YOUR PARDON SIR AND I EVEN WITHDRAW THE EXPRESSIONS WHICH
PROVOKED THAT INADVERTENCE
NOR DOES THIS APOLOGY PREVENT YOU FROM
HOLDING ME RESPONSIBLE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE ELSEWHERE FOR AN
INDISCRETION COMMITTED IN BEHALF OF A LADY MY ER CLIENT
YOUR CLIENT DO YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TAKEN HER CASE YOU THE COUNSEL
FOR THE DITCH COMPANY SAID MR
HOTCHKISS IN TREMBLING INDIGNATION
HAVING WON YOUR CASE SIR SAID THE COLONEL COOLLY
THE ER USAGES OF ADVOCACY DO NOT PREVENT ME FROM ESPOUSING THE
CAUSE OF THE WEAK AND UNPROTECTED
WE SHALL SEE SIR SAID HOTCHKISS GRASPING THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR
AND BACKING INTO THE PASSAGE
THERE ARE OTHER LAWYERS WHO
PERMIT ME TO SEE YOU OUT INTERRUPTED THE COLONEL RISING POLITELY
WILL BE READY TO RESIST THE ATTACKS OF BLACKMAIL CONTINUED
HOTCHKISS RETREATING ALONG THE PASSAGE
AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO REPEAT YOUR REMARKS TO ME IN THE
STREET CONTINUED THE COLONEL BOWING AS HE PERSISTED IN FOLLOWING
HIS VISITOR TO THE DOOR
BUT HERE MR
HOTCHKISS QUICKLY SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND HURRIED
AWAY
THE COLONEL RETURNED TO HIS OFFICE AND SITTING DOWN TOOK A
SHEET OF LETTER PAPER BEARING THE INSCRIPTION STARBOTTLE AND STRYKER
ATTORNEYS AND COUNSELLORS AND WROTE THE FOLLOWING LINES
HOOKER VERSUS HOTCHKISS
DEAR MADAM HAVING HAD A VISIT FROM THE DEFENDANT IN
ABOVE WE SHOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU AT
2 P M
TO MORROW
YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANTS
STARBOTTLE AND STRYKER
THIS HE SEALED AND DESPATCHED BY HIS TRUSTED SERVANT JIM AND THEN
DEVOTED A FEW MOMENTS TO REFLECTION
IT WAS THE CUSTOM OF THE COLONEL
TO ACT FIRST AND JUSTIFY THE ACTION BY REASON AFTERWARDS
HE KNEW THAT HOTCHKISS WOULD AT ONCE LAY THE MATTER BEFORE RIVAL
COUNSEL
HE KNEW THAT THEY WOULD ADVISE HIM THAT MISS HOOKER HAD NO
CASE THAT SHE WOULD BE NON SUITED ON HER OWN EVIDENCE AND HE OUGHT
NOT TO COMPROMISE BUT BE READY TO STAND TRIAL
HE BELIEVED HOWEVER
THAT HOTCHKISS FEARED THAT EXPOSURE AND ALTHOUGH HIS OWN INSTINCTS
HAD BEEN AT FIRST AGAINST THAT REMEDY HE WAS NOW INSTINCTIVELY IN
FAVOR OF IT
HE REMEMBERED HIS OWN POWER WITH A JURY HIS VANITY AND
HIS CHIVALRY ALIKE APPROVED OF THIS HEROIC METHOD HE WAS BOUND BY THE
PROSAIC FACTS HE HAD HIS OWN THEORY OF THE CASE WHICH NO MERE
EVIDENCE COULD GAINSAY
IN FACT MRS
HOOKER'S OWN WORDS THAT HE WAS
TO TELL THE STORY IN HIS OWN WAY ACTUALLY APPEARED TO HIM AN
INSPIRATION AND A PROPHECY
PERHAPS THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE DUE POSSIBLY TO THE LADY'S WONDERFUL
EYES OF WHICH HE HAD THOUGHT MUCH
YET IT WAS NOT HER SIMPLICITY THAT
AFFECTED HIM SOLELY ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS HER APPARENT INTELLIGENT
READING OF THE CHARACTER OF HER RECREANT LOVER AND OF HIS OWN OF ALL
THE COLONEL'S PREVIOUS LIGHT OR SERIOUS LOVES NONE HAD EVER BEFORE
FLATTERED HIM IN THAT WAY
AND IT WAS THIS COMBINED WITH THE RESPECT
WHICH HE HAD HELD FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL RELATIONS THAT PRECLUDED HIS
HAVING A MORE FAMILIAR KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CLIENT THROUGH SERIOUS
QUESTIONING OR PLAYFUL GALLANTRY
I AM NOT SURE IT WAS NOT PART OF
THE CHARM TO HAVE A RUSTIC FEMME INCOMPRISE AS A CLIENT
NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE RESPECT WITH WHICH HE GREETED HER AS SHE
ENTERED HIS OFFICE THE NEXT DAY
HE EVEN AFFECTED NOT TO NOTICE THAT
SHE HAD PUT ON HER BEST CLOTHES AND HE MADE NO DOUBT APPEARED AS WHEN
SHE HAD FIRST ATTRACTED THE MATURE YET FAITHLESS ATTENTIONS OF DEACON
HOTCHKISS AT CHURCH
A WHITE VIRGINAL MUSLIN WAS BELTED AROUND HER
SLIM FIGURE BY A BLUE RIBBON AND HER LEGHORN HAT WAS DRAWN AROUND HER
OVAL CHEEK BY A BOW OF THE SAME COLOR
SHE HAD A SOUTHERN GIRL'S
NARROW FEET ENCASED IN WHITE STOCKINGS AND KID SLIPPERS WHICH WERE
CROSSED PRIMLY BEFORE HER AS SHE SAT IN A CHAIR SUPPORTING HER ARM BY
HER FAITHFUL PARASOL PLANTED FIRMLY ON THE FLOOR
A FAINT ODOR OF
SOUTHERNWOOD EXHALED FROM HER AND ODDLY ENOUGH STIRRED THE COLONEL
WITH A FAR OFF RECOLLECTION OF A PINE SHADED SUNDAY SCHOOL ON A
GEORGIA HILLSIDE AND OF HIS FIRST LOVE AGED TEN IN A SHORT STARCHED
FROCK
POSSIBLY IT WAS THE SAME RECOLLECTION THAT REVIVED SOMETHING OF
THE AWKWARDNESS HE HAD FELT THEN
HE HOWEVER SMILED VAGUELY AND SITTING DOWN COUGHED SLIGHTLY AND
PLACED HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER
I HAVE HAD AN ER INTERVIEW WITH MR
HOTCHKISS BUT I ER REGRET TO SAY THERE SEEMS TO BE NO PROSPECT
OF ER COMPROMISE HE PAUSED AND TO HIS SURPRISE HER LISTLESS
COMPANY FACE LIT UP WITH AN ADORABLE SMILE
OF COURSE KETCH HIM
SHE SAID
WAS HE MAD WHEN YOU TOLD HIM SHE PUT HER KNEES
COMFORTABLY TOGETHER AND LEANED FORWARD FOR A REPLY
FOR ALL THAT WILD HORSES COULD NOT HAVE TORN FROM THE COLONEL A WORD
ABOUT HOTCHKISS'S ANGER
HE EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF EMPLOYING
COUNSEL AND DEFENDING A SUIT RETURNED THE COLONEL AFFABLY BASKING
IN HER SMILE
SHE DRAGGED HER CHAIR NEARER HIS DESK
THEN YOU'LL
FIGHT HIM TOOTH AND NAIL SHE SAID EAGERLY YOU'LL SHOW HIM UP
YOU'LL TELL THE WHOLE STORY YOUR OWN WAY YOU'LL GIVE HIM FITS AND
YOU'LL MAKE HIM PAY SURE SHE WENT ON BREATHLESSLY
I ER WILL SAID THE COLONEL ALMOST AS BREATHLESSLY
SHE CAUGHT HIS FAT WHITE HAND WHICH WAS LYING ON THE TABLE BETWEEN
HER OWN AND LIFTED IT TO HER LIPS
HE FELT HER SOFT YOUNG FINGERS EVEN
THROUGH THE LISLE THREAD GLOVES THAT ENCASED THEM AND THE WARM
MOISTURE OF HER LIPS UPON HIS SKIN
HE FELT HIMSELF FLUSHING BUT WAS
UNABLE TO BREAK THE SILENCE OR CHANGE HIS POSITION
THE NEXT MOMENT
SHE HAD SCUTTLED BACK WITH HER CHAIR TO HER OLD POSITION
I ER CERTAINLY SHALL DO MY BEST STAMMERED THE COLONEL IN AN
ATTEMPT TO RECOVER HIS DIGNITY AND COMPOSURE
THAT'S ENOUGH YOU'LL DO IT SAID THE GIRL ENTHUSIASTICALLY
LORDY JUST YOU TALK FOR ME AS YE DID FOR HIS OLD DITCH COMPANY
AND YOU'LL FETCH IT EVERY TIME WHY WHEN YOU MADE THAT JURY SIT UP
THE OTHER DAY WHEN YOU GOT THAT OFF ABOUT THE MERRIKAN FLAG WAVING
EQUALLY OVER THE RIGHTS OF HONEST CITIZENS BANDED TOGETHER IN PEACEFUL
COMMERCIAL PURSUITS AS WELL AS OVER THE FORTRESS OF OFFICIAL
PROFLIG
OLIGARCHY MURMURED THE COLONEL COURTEOUSLY
OLIGARCHY REPEATED THE GIRL QUICKLY MY BREATH WAS JUST TOOK
AWAY
I SAID TO MAW 'AIN'T HE TOO SWEET FOR ANYTHING I DID HONEST
INJIN AND WHEN YOU ROLLED IT ALL OFF AT THE END NEVER MISSING A
WORD YOU DIDN'T NEED TO MARK 'EM IN A LESSON BOOK BUT HAD 'EM ALL
READY ON YOUR TONGUE AND WALKED OUT WELL I DIDN'T KNOW YOU NOR THE
DITCH COMPANY FROM ADAM BUT I COULD HAVE JUST RUN OVER AND KISSED YOU
THERE BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT
SHE LAUGHED WITH HER FACE GLOWING ALTHOUGH HER STRANGE EYES WERE
CAST DOWN
ALACK THE COLONEL'S FACE WAS EQUALLY FLUSHED AND HIS OWN
BEADY EYES WERE ON HIS DESK
TO ANY OTHER WOMAN HE WOULD HAVE VOICED
THE BANAL GALLANTRY THAT HE SHOULD NOW HIMSELF LOOK FORWARD TO THAT
REWARD BUT THE WORDS NEVER REACHED HIS LIPS
HE LAUGHED COUGHED
SLIGHTLY AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP AGAIN SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE SAME
ATTITUDE AS ON HER FIRST VISIT WITH HER PARASOL POINT ON THE FLOOR
I MUST ASK YOU TO ER DIRECT YOUR MEMORY TO ER ANOTHER POINT THE
BREAKING OFF OF THE ER ER ER ENGAGEMENT
DID HE ER GIVE ANY
REASON FOR IT OR SHOW ANY CAUSE
NO HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING RETURNED THE GIRL
NOT IN HIS USUAL WAY ER NO REPROACHES OUT OF THE HYMN BOOK OR
THE SACRED WRITINGS
NO HE JUST QUIT
ER CEASED HIS ATTENTIONS SAID THE COLONEL GRAVELY
AND NATURALLY
YOU ER WERE NOT CONSCIOUS OF ANY CAUSE FOR HIS DOING SO THE GIRL
RAISED HER WONDERFUL EYES SO SUDDENLY AND SO PENETRATINGLY WITHOUT
REPLY IN ANY OTHER WAY THAT THE COLONEL COULD ONLY HURRIEDLY SAY I
SEE NONE OF COURSE
AT WHICH SHE ROSE THE COLONEL RISING ALSO
WE SHALL BEGIN
PROCEEDINGS AT ONCE
I MUST HOWEVER CAUTION YOU TO ANSWER NO
QUESTIONS NOR SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS CASE TO ANY ONE UNTIL YOU ARE IN
COURT
SHE ANSWERED HIS REQUEST WITH ANOTHER INTELLIGENT LOOK AND A NOD
HE
ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE DOOR
AS HE TOOK HER PROFFERED HAND HE RAISED
THE LISLE THREAD FINGERS TO HIS LIPS WITH OLD FASHIONED GALLANTRY
AS
IF THAT ACT HAD CONDONED FOR HIS FIRST OMISSIONS AND AWKWARDNESS HE
BECAME HIS OLD FASHIONED SELF AGAIN BUTTONED HIS COAT PULLED OUT HIS
SHIRT FRILL AND STRUTTED BACK TO HIS DESK
A DAY OR TWO LATER IT WAS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE TOWN THAT ZAIDEE HOOKER
HAD SUED ADONIRAM HOTCHKISS FOR BREACH OF PROMISE AND THAT THE
DAMAGES WERE LAID AT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
AS IN THOSE BUCOLIC DAYS
THE WESTERN PRESS WAS UNDER THE SECURE CENSORSHIP OF A REVOLVER A
CAUTIOUS TONE OF CRITICISM PREVAILED AND ANY GOSSIP WAS CONFINED TO
PERSONAL EXPRESSION AND EVEN THEN AT THE RISK OF THE GOSSIPER
NEVERTHELESS THE SITUATION PROVOKED THE INTENSEST CURIOSITY
THE
COLONEL WAS APPROACHED UNTIL HIS STATEMENT THAT HE SHOULD CONSIDER
ANY ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME HIS PROFESSIONAL SECRECY A PERSONAL REFLECTION
WITHHELD FURTHER ADVANCES
THE COMMUNITY WERE LEFT TO THE MORE
OSTENTATIOUS INFORMATION OF THE DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL MESSRS
KITCHAM
AND BILSER THAT THE CASE WAS RIDICULOUS AND ROTTEN THAT THE
PLAINTIFF WOULD BE NONSUITED AND THE FIRE EATING STARBOTTLE WOULD BE
TAUGHT A LESSON THAT HE COULD NOT BULLY THE LAW AND THERE WERE SOME
DARK HINTS OF A CONSPIRACY
IT WAS EVEN HINTED THAT THE CASE WAS THE
REVENGEFUL AND PREPOSTEROUS OUTCOME OF THE REFUSAL OF HOTCHKISS TO PAY
STARBOTTLE AN EXTRAVAGANT FEE FOR HIS LATE SERVICES TO THE DITCH
COMPANY
IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THESE WORDS WERE NOT REPORTED
TO THE COLONEL
IT WAS HOWEVER AN UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE FOR THE
CALMER ETHICAL CONSIDERATION OF THE SUBJECT THAT THE CHURCH SIDED
WITH HOTCHKISS AS THIS PROVOKED AN EQUAL ADHERENCE TO THE PLAINTIFF
AND STARBOTTLE ON THE PART OF THE LARGER BODY OF NON CHURCH GOERS WHO
WERE DELIGHTED AT A POSSIBLE EXPOSURE OF THE WEAKNESS OF RELIGIOUS
RECTITUDE
I'VE ALLUS HAD MY SUSPICIONS O' THEM EARLY CANDLE LIGHT
MEETINGS DOWN AT THAT GOSPEL SHOP SAID ONE CRITIC AND I RECKON
DEACON HOTCHKISS DIDN'T ROPE IN THE GALS TO ATTEND JEST FOR
PSALM SINGING THEN FOR HIM TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE BOARD AFORE THE
GAME'S FINISHED AND TRY TO SNEAK OUT OF IT SAID ANOTHER
I SUPPOSE
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL RELIGIOUS
IT WAS THEREFORE NOT REMARKABLE THAT THE COURTHOUSE THREE WEEKS LATER
WAS CROWDED WITH AN EXCITED MULTITUDE OF THE CURIOUS AND SYMPATHIZING
THE FAIR PLAINTIFF WITH HER MOTHER WAS EARLY IN ATTENDANCE AND
UNDER THE COLONEL'S ADVICE APPEARED IN THE SAME MODEST GARB IN WHICH
SHE HAD FIRST VISITED HIS OFFICE
THIS AND HER DOWNCAST MODEST
DEMEANOR WERE PERHAPS AT FIRST DISAPPOINTING TO THE CROWD WHO HAD
EVIDENTLY EXPECTED A PARAGON OF LOVELINESS AS THE CIRCE OF THE GRIM
ASCETIC DEFENDANT WHO SAT BESIDE HIS COUNSEL
BUT PRESENTLY ALL EYES
WERE FIXED ON THE COLONEL WHO CERTAINLY MADE UP IN HIS APPEARANCE
ANY DEFICIENCY OF HIS FAIR CLIENT
HIS PORTLY FIGURE WAS CLOTHED IN A
BLUE DRESS COAT WITH BRASS BUTTONS A BUFF WAISTCOAT WHICH PERMITTED
HIS FRILLED SHIRT FRONT TO BECOME ERECTILE ABOVE IT A BLACK SATIN
STOCK WHICH CONFINED A BOYISH TURNED DOWN COLLAR AROUND HIS FULL NECK
AND IMMACULATE DRILL TROUSERS STRAPPED OVER VARNISHED BOOTS
A MURMUR
RAN ROUND THE COURT
OLD 'PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE' HAD GOT HIS
WAR PAINT ON THE OLD WAR HORSE IS SMELLING POWDER WERE WHISPERED
COMMENTS
YET FOR ALL THAT THE MOST IRREVERENT AMONG THEM RECOGNIZED
VAGUELY IN THIS BIZARRE FIGURE SOMETHING OF AN HONORED PAST IN THEIR
COUNTRY'S HISTORY AND POSSIBLY FELT THE SPELL OF OLD DEEDS AND OLD
NAMES THAT HAD ONCE THRILLED THEIR BOYISH PULSES
THE NEW DISTRICT
JUDGE RETURNED COLONEL STARBOTTLE'S PROFOUNDLY PUNCTILIOUS BOW
THE
COLONEL WAS FOLLOWED BY HIS NEGRO SERVANT CARRYING A PARCEL OF
HYMN BOOKS AND BIBLES WHO WITH A COURTESY EVIDENTLY IMITATED FROM
HIS MASTER PLACED ONE BEFORE THE OPPOSITE COUNSEL
THIS AFTER A
FIRST CURIOUS GLANCE THE LAWYER SOMEWHAT SUPERCILIOUSLY TOSSED ASIDE
BUT WHEN JIM PROCEEDING TO THE JURY BOX PLACED WITH EQUAL POLITENESS
THE REMAINING COPIES BEFORE THE JURY THE OPPOSITE COUNSEL SPRANG TO
HIS FEET
I WANT TO DIRECT THE ATTENTION OF THE COURT TO THIS UNPRECEDENTED
TAMPERING WITH THE JURY BY THIS GRATUITOUS EXHIBITION OF MATTER
IMPERTINENT AND IRRELEVANT TO THE ISSUE
THE JUDGE CAST AN INQUIRING LOOK AT COLONEL STARBOTTLE
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT RETURNED COLONEL STARBOTTLE WITH DIGNITY
IGNORING THE COUNSEL THE DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL WILL OBSERVE THAT HE IS
ALREADY FURNISHED WITH THE MATTER WHICH I REGRET TO SAY HE HAS
TREATED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE COURT AND OF HIS CLIENT A DEACON OF
THE CHURCH WITH ER GREAT SUPERCILIOUSNESS
WHEN I STATE TO YOUR
HONOR THAT THE BOOKS IN QUESTION ARE HYMN BOOKS AND COPIES OF THE
HOLY SCRIPTURES AND THAT THEY ARE FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE JURY
TO WHOM I SHALL HAVE TO REFER THEM IN THE COURSE OF MY OPENING I
BELIEVE I AM WITHIN MY RIGHTS
THE ACT IS CERTAINLY UNPRECEDENTED SAID THE JUDGE DRYLY BUT
UNLESS THE COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFF EXPECTS THE JURY TO SING FROM
THESE HYMN BOOKS THEIR INTRODUCTION IS NOT IMPROPER AND I CANNOT
ADMIT THE OBJECTION
AS DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL ARE FURNISHED WITH COPIES
ALSO THEY CANNOT PLEAD 'SURPRISE AS IN THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW
MATTER AND AS PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL RELIES EVIDENTLY UPON THE JURY'S
ATTENTION TO HIS OPENING HE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST PERSON TO DISTRACT
IT AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED ADDRESSING THE COLONEL WHO REMAINED
STANDING THE COURT IS WITH YOU SIR PROCEED
BUT THE COLONEL REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND STATUESQUE WITH FOLDED ARMS
I HAVE OVERRULED THE OBJECTION REPEATED THE JUDGE YOU MAY GO ON
I AM WAITING YOUR HONOR FOR THE ER WITHDRAWAL BY THE DEFENDANT'S
COUNSEL OF THE WORD 'TAMPERING AS REFERS TO MYSELF AND OF
'IMPERTINENT AS REFERS TO THE SACRED VOLUMES
THE REQUEST IS A PROPER ONE AND I HAVE NO DOUBT WILL BE ACCEDED TO
RETURNED THE JUDGE QUIETLY
THE DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL ROSE AND MUMBLED
A FEW WORDS OF APOLOGY AND THE INCIDENT CLOSED
THERE WAS HOWEVER A
GENERAL FEELING THAT THE COLONEL HAD IN SOME WAY SCORED AND IF HIS
OBJECT HAD BEEN TO EXCITE THE GREATEST CURIOSITY ABOUT THE BOOKS HE
HAD MADE HIS POINT
BUT IMPASSIVE OF HIS VICTORY HE INFLATED HIS CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT
HAND IN THE BREAST OF HIS BUTTONED COAT AND BEGAN
HIS USUAL HIGH
COLOR HAD PALED SLIGHTLY BUT THE SMALL PUPILS OF HIS PROMINENT EYES
GLITTERED LIKE STEEL
THE YOUNG GIRL LEANED FORWARD IN HER CHAIR WITH
AN ATTENTION SO BREATHLESS A SYMPATHY SO QUICK AND AN ADMIRATION SO
ARTLESS AND UNCONSCIOUS THAT IN AN INSTANT SHE DIVIDED WITH THE
SPEAKER THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
IT WAS VERY HOT THE
COURT WAS CROWDED TO SUFFOCATION EVEN THE OPEN WINDOWS REVEALED A
CROWD OF FACES OUTSIDE THE BUILDING EAGERLY FOLLOWING THE COLONEL'S
WORDS
HE WOULD REMIND THE JURY THAT ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO HE STOOD THERE AS
THE ADVOCATE OF A POWERFUL COMPANY THEN REPRESENTED BY THE PRESENT
DEFENDANT
HE SPOKE THEN AS THE CHAMPION OF STRICT JUSTICE AGAINST
LEGAL OPPRESSION NO LESS SHOULD HE TO DAY CHAMPION THE CAUSE OF THE
UNPROTECTED AND THE COMPARATIVELY DEFENSELESS SAVE FOR THAT PARAMOUNT
POWER WHICH SURROUNDS BEAUTY AND INNOCENCE EVEN THOUGH THE PLAINTIFF
OF YESTERDAY WAS THE DEFENDANT OF TO DAY
AS HE APPROACHED THE COURT A
MOMENT AGO HE HAD RAISED HIS EYES AND BEHELD THE STARRY FLAG FLYING
FROM ITS DOME AND HE KNEW THAT GLORIOUS BANNER WAS A SYMBOL OF THE
PERFECT EQUALITY UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RICH AND THE POOR
THE STRONG AND THE WEAK AN EQUALITY WHICH MADE THE SIMPLE CITIZEN
TAKEN FROM THE PLOUGH IN THE VELD THE PICK IN THE GULCH OR FROM
BEHIND THE COUNTER IN THE MINING TOWN WHO SERVED ON THAT JURY THE
EQUAL ARBITERS OF JUSTICE WITH THAT HIGHEST LEGAL LUMINARY WHOM THEY
WERE PROUD TO WELCOME ON THE BENCH TO DAY
THE COLONEL PAUSED WITH A
STATELY BOW TO THE IMPASSIVE JUDGE
IT WAS THIS HE CONTINUED WHICH
LIFTED HIS HEART AS HE APPROACHED THE BUILDING
AND YET HE HAD
ENTERED IT WITH AN UNCERTAIN HE MIGHT ALMOST SAY A TIMID STEP
AND
WHY HE KNEW GENTLEMEN HE WAS ABOUT TO CONFRONT A PROFOUND AYE A
SACRED RESPONSIBILITY THOSE HYMN BOOKS AND HOLY WRITINGS HANDED TO
THE JURY WERE NOT AS HIS HONOR SURMISED FOR THE PURPOSE OF
ENABLING THE JURY TO INDULGE IN ER PRELIMINARY CHORAL EXERCISE HE
MIGHT INDEED SAY ALAS NOT THEY WERE THE DAMNING INCONTROVERTIBLE
PROOFS OF THE PERFIDY OF THE DEFENDANT
AND THEY WOULD PROVE AS
TERRIBLE A WARNING TO HIM AS THE FATAL CHARACTERS UPON BELSHAZZAR'S
WALL
THERE WAS A STRONG SENSATION
HOTCHKISS TURNED A SALLOW GREEN
HIS LAWYERS ASSUMED A CARELESS SMILE
IT WAS HIS DUTY TO TELL THEM THAT THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE ORDINARY
BREACH OF PROMISE CASES WHICH WERE TOO OFTEN THE OCCASION OF
RUTHLESS MIRTH AND INDECENT LEVITY IN THE COURTROOM
THE JURY WOULD
FIND NOTHING OF THAT HERE THERE WERE NO LOVE LETTERS WITH THE
EPITHETS OF ENDEARMENT NOR THOSE MYSTIC CROSSES AND CIPHERS WHICH HE
HAD BEEN CREDIBLY INFORMED CHASTELY HID THE EXCHANGE OF THOSE MUTUAL
CARESSES KNOWN AS KISSES THERE WAS NO CRUEL TEARING OF THE VEIL
FROM THOSE SACRED PRIVACIES OF THE HUMAN AFFECTION THERE WAS NO
FORENSIC SHOUTING OUT OF THOSE FOND CONFIDENCES MEANT ONLY FOR ONE
BUT THERE WAS HE WAS SHOCKED TO SAY A NEW SACRILEGIOUS INTRUSION
THE WEAK PIPINGS OF CUPID WERE MINGLED WITH THE CHORUS OF THE
SAINTS THE SANCTITY OF THE TEMPLE KNOWN AS THE MEETING HOUSE WAS
DESECRATED BY PROCEEDINGS MORE IN KEEPING WITH THE SHRINE OF
VENUS AND THE INSPIRED WRITINGS THEMSELVES WERE USED AS THE MEDIUM OF
AMATORY AND WANTON FLIRTATION BY THE DEFENDANT IN HIS SACRED CAPACITY
AS DEACON
THE COLONEL ARTISTICALLY PAUSED AFTER THIS THUNDEROUS DENUNCIATION
THE JURY TURNED EAGERLY TO THE LEAVES OF THE HYMN BOOKS BUT THE
LARGER GAZE OF THE AUDIENCE REMAINED FIXED UPON THE SPEAKER AND THE
GIRL WHO SAT IN RAPT ADMIRATION OF HIS PERIODS
AFTER THE HUSH THE
COLONEL CONTINUED IN A LOWER AND SADDER VOICE THERE ARE PERHAPS
FEW OF US HERE GENTLEMEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DEFENDANT WHO
CAN ARROGATE TO THEMSELVES THE TITLE OF REGULAR CHURCHGOERS OR TO
WHOM THESE HUMBLER FUNCTIONS OF THE PRAYER MEETING THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
AND THE BIBLE CLASS ARE HABITUALLY FAMILIAR
YET MORE
SOLEMNLY DOWN IN YOUR HEARTS IS THE DEEP CONVICTION OF OUR
SHORT COMINGS AND FAILINGS AND A LAUDABLE DESIRE THAT OTHERS AT LEAST
SHOULD PROFIT BY THE TEACHINGS WE NEGLECT
PERHAPS HE CONTINUED
CLOSING HIS EYES DREAMILY THERE IS NOT A MAN HERE WHO DOES NOT
RECALL THE HAPPY DAYS OF HIS BOYHOOD THE RUSTIC VILLAGE SPIRE THE
LESSONS SHARED WITH SOME ARTLESS VILLAGE MAIDEN WITH WHOM HE LATER
SAUNTERED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE WOODS AS THE SIMPLE RHYME ROSE
UPON THEIR LIPS
ALWAYS MAKE IT A POINT TO HAVE IT A RULE
NEVER TO BE LATE AT THE SABBATH SCHOOL
HE WOULD RECALL THE STRAWBERRY FEASTS THE WELCOME ANNUAL PICNIC
REDOLENT WITH HUNKS OF GINGERBREAD AND SARSAPARILLA
HOW WOULD THEY
FEEL TO KNOW THAT THESE SACRED RECOLLECTIONS WERE NOW FOREVER PROFANED
IN THEIR MEMORY BY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS CAPABLE OF
USING SUCH OCCASIONS TO MAKE LOVE TO THE LARGER GIRLS AND TEACHERS
WHILST HIS ARTLESS COMPANIONS WERE INNOCENTLY THE COURT WILL PARDON
ME FOR INTRODUCING WHAT I AM CREDIBLY INFORMED IS THE LOCAL EXPRESSION
'DOING GOOSEBERRY' THE TREMULOUS FLICKER OF A SMILE PASSED OVER THE
FACES OF THE LISTENING CROWD AND THE COLONEL SLIGHTLY WINCED
BUT HE
RECOVERED HIMSELF INSTANTLY AND CONTINUED
MY CLIENT THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF A WIDOWED MOTHER WHO HAS FOR YEARS
STEMMED THE VARYING TIDES OF ADVERSITY IN THE WESTERN PRECINCTS OF
THIS TOWN STANDS BEFORE YOU TODAY INVESTED ONLY IN HER OWN INNOCENCE
SHE WEARS NO ER RICH GIFTS OF HER FAITHLESS ADMIRER IS PANOPLIED IN
NO JEWELS RINGS NOR MEMENTOES OF AFFECTION SUCH AS LOVERS DELIGHT TO
HANG UPON THE SHRINE OF THEIR AFFECTIONS HERS IS NOT THE GLORY WITH
WHICH SOLOMON DECORATED THE QUEEN OF SHEBA THOUGH THE DEFENDANT AS I
SHALL SHOW LATER CLOTHED HER IN THE LESS EXPENSIVE FLOWERS OF THE
KING'S POETRY
NO GENTLEMEN THE DEFENDANT EXHIBITED IN THIS AFFAIR A
CERTAIN FRUGALITY OF ER PECUNIARY INVESTMENT WHICH I AM WILLING TO
ADMIT MAY BE COMMENDABLE IN HIS CLASS
HIS ONLY GIFT WAS
CHARACTERISTIC ALIKE OF HIS METHODS AND HIS ECONOMY
THERE IS I
UNDERSTAND A CERTAIN NOT UNIMPORTANT FEATURE OF RELIGIOUS EXERCISE
KNOWN AS 'TAKING A COLLECTION THE DEFENDANT ON THIS OCCASION BY
THE MUTE PRESENTATION OF A TIP PLATE COVERED WITH BAIZE SOLICITED THE
PECUNIARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE FAITHFUL
ON APPROACHING THE PLAINTIFF
HOWEVER HE HIMSELF SLIPPED A LOVE TOKEN UPON THE PLATE AND PUSHED IT
TOWARDS HER
THAT LOVE TOKEN WAS A LOZENGE A SMALL DISK I HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE CONCOCTED OF PEPPERMINT AND SUGAR BEARING UPON ITS
REVERSE SURFACE THE SIMPLE WORDS 'I LOVE YOU I HAVE SINCE
ASCERTAINED THAT THESE DISKS MAY BE BOUGHT FOR FIVE CENTS A DOZEN OR
AT CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN ONE HALF CENT FOR THE SINGLE LOZENGE
YES
GENTLEMEN THE WORDS 'I LOVE YOU THE OLDEST LEGEND OF ALL THE
REFRAIN 'WHEN THE MORNING STARS SANG TOGETHER' WERE PRESENTED TO THE
PLAINTIFF BY A MEDIUM SO INSIGNIFICANT THAT THERE IS HAPPILY NO COIN
IN THE REPUBLIC LOW ENOUGH TO REPRESENT ITS VALUE
I SHALL PROVE TO YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY SAID THE COLONEL
SOLEMNLY DRAWING A BIBLE FROM HIS COAT TAIL POCKET THAT THE
DEFENDANT FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS CONDUCTED AN AMATORY
CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PLAINTIFF BY MEANS OF UNDERLINED WORDS OF
SACRED WRIT AND CHURCH PSALMODY SUCH AS 'BELOVED 'PRECIOUS AND
'DEAREST OCCASIONALLY APPROPRIATING WHOLE PASSAGES WHICH SEEMED
APPOSITE TO HIS TENDER PASSION
I SHALL CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO ONE OF
THEM
THE DEFENDANT WHILE PROFESSING TO BE A TOTAL ABSTAINER A MAN
WHO IN MY OWN KNOWLEDGE HAS REFUSED SPIRITUOUS REFRESHMENT AS AN
INORDINATE WEAKNESS OF THE FLESH WITH SHAMELESS HYPOCRISY UNDERSCORES
WITH HIS PENCIL THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE AND PRESENTS IT TO THE
PLAINTIFF
THE GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY WILL FIND IT IN THE SONG OF
SOLOMON PAGE 548 CHAPTER II VERSE 5 AFTER A PAUSE IN WHICH THE
RAPID RUSTLING OF LEAVES WAS HEARD IN THE JURY BOX COLONEL
STARBOTTLE DECLAIMED IN A PLEADING STENTORIAN VOICE 'STAY ME WITH
ER FLAGONS COMFORT ME WITH ER APPLES FOR I AM ER SICK OF
LOVE YES GENTLEMEN YES YOU MAY WELL TURN FROM THOSE ACCUSING
PAGES AND LOOK AT THE DOUBLE FACED DEFENDANT
HE DESIRES TO ER BE
'STAYED WITH FLAGONS' I AM NOT AWARE AT PRESENT WHAT KIND OF
LIQUOR IS HABITUALLY DISPENSED AT THESE MEETINGS AND FOR WHICH THE
DEFENDANT SO URGENTLY CLAMORED BUT IT WILL BE MY DUTY BEFORE THIS
TRIAL IS OVER TO DISCOVER IT IF I HAVE TO SUMMON EVERY BARKEEPER IN
THIS DISTRICT
FOR THE MOMENT I WILL SIMPLY CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO
THE QUANTITY
IT IS NOT A SINGLE DRINK THAT THE DEFENDANT ASKS FOR
NOT A GLASS OF LIGHT AND GENEROUS WINE TO BE SHARED WITH HIS
INAMORATA BUT A NUMBER OF FLAGONS OR VESSELS EACH POSSIBLY HOLDING
A PINT MEASURE FOR HIMSELF
THE SMILE OF THE AUDIENCE HAD BECOME A LAUGH
THE JUDGE LOOKED UP
WARNINGLY WHEN HIS EYE CAUGHT THE FACT THAT THE COLONEL HAD AGAIN
WINCED AT THIS MIRTH
HE REGARDED HIM SERIOUSLY
MR
HOTCHKISS'S
COUNSEL HAD JOINED IN THE LAUGH AFFECTEDLY BUT HOTCHKISS HIMSELF WAS
ASHY PALE
THERE WAS ALSO A COMMOTION IN THE JURY BOX A HURRIED
TURNING OVER OF LEAVES AND AN EXCITED DISCUSSION
THE GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY SAID THE JUDGE WITH OFFICIAL GRAVITY
WILL PLEASE KEEP ORDER AND ATTEND ONLY TO THE SPEECHES OF COUNSEL
ANY DISCUSSION HERE IS IRREGULAR AND PREMATURE AND MUST BE RESERVED
FOR THE JURY ROOM AFTER THEY HAVE RETIRED
THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET
HE WAS A POWERFUL MAN
WITH A GOOD HUMORED FACE AND IN SPITE OF HIS UNFELICITOUS NICKNAME
OF THE BONE BREAKER HAD A KINDLY SIMPLE BUT SOMEWHAT EMOTIONAL
NATURE
NEVERTHELESS IT APPEARED AS IF HE WERE LABORING UNDER SOME
POWERFUL INDIGNATION
CAN WE ASK A QUESTION JUDGE HE SAID RESPECTFULLY ALTHOUGH HIS
VOICE HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE WESTERN AMERICAN RING IN IT AS OF ONE WHO
WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAT HE COULD BE ADDRESSING ANY BUT HIS PEERS
YES SAID THE JUDGE GOOD HUMOREDLY
WE'RE FINDING IN THIS YERE PIECE OUT OF WHICH THE KERNEL HES JUST
BIN A QUOTIN' SOME LANGUAGE THAT ME AND MY PARDNERS ALLOW HADN'T
ORTER TO BE READ OUT AFORE A YOUNG LADY IN COURT AND WE WANT TO KNOW
OF YOU EZ A FAIR MINDED AND IMPARTIAL MAN EF THIS IS THE REG'LAR
KIND O' BOOK GIVEN TO GALS AND BABIES DOWN AT THE MEETIN' HOUSE
THE JURY WILL PLEASE FOLLOW THE COUNSEL'S SPEECH WITHOUT COMMENT
SAID THE JUDGE BRIEFLY FULLY AWARE THAT THE DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL
WOULD SPRING TO HIS FEET AS HE DID PROMPTLY
THE COURT WILL ALLOW US
TO EXPLAIN TO THE GENTLEMEN THAT THE LANGUAGE THEY SEEM TO OBJECT TO
HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE BEST THEOLOGIANS FOR THE LAST THOUSAND YEARS
AS BEING PURELY MYSTIC
AS I WILL EXPLAIN LATER THOSE ARE MERELY
SYMBOLS OF THE CHURCH
OF WOT INTERRUPTED THE FOREMAN IN DEEP SCORN
OF THE CHURCH
WE AIN'T ASKIN' ANY QUESTIONS O' YOU AND WE AIN'T TAKIN' ANY
ANSWERS SAID THE FOREMAN SITTING DOWN PROMPTLY
I MUST INSIST SAID THE JUDGE STERNLY THAT THE PLAINTIFF'S
COUNSEL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE HIS OPENING WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
YOU
TO DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL WILL HAVE YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO REPLY LATER
THE COUNSEL SANK DOWN IN HIS SEAT WITH THE BITTER CONVICTION THAT THE
JURY WAS MANIFESTLY AGAINST HIM AND THE CASE AS GOOD AS LOST
BUT HIS
FACE WAS SCARCELY AS DISTURBED AS HIS CLIENT'S WHO IN GREAT
AGITATION HAD BEGUN TO ARGUE WITH HIM WILDLY AND WAS APPARENTLY
PRESSING SOME POINT AGAINST THE LAWYER'S VEHEMENT OPPOSAL
THE
COLONEL'S MURKY EYES BRIGHTENED AS HE STILL STOOD ERECT WITH HIS HAND
THRUST IN HIS BREAST
IT WILL BE PUT TO YOU GENTLEMEN WHEN THE COUNSEL ON THE OTHER SIDE
REFRAINS FROM MERE INTERRUPTION AND CONFINES HIMSELF TO REPLY THAT MY
UNFORTUNATE CLIENT HAS NO ACTION NO REMEDY AT LAW BECAUSE THERE WERE
NO SPOKEN WORDS OF ENDEARMENT
BUT GENTLEMEN IT WILL DEPEND UPON
YOU TO SAY WHAT ARE AND WHAT ARE NOT ARTICULATE EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE
WE ALL KNOW THAT AMONG THE LOWER ANIMALS WITH WHOM YOU MAY POSSIBLY
BE CALLED UPON TO CLASSIFY THE DEFENDANT THERE ARE CERTAIN SIGNALS
MORE OR LESS HARMONIOUS AS THE CASE MAY BE
THE ASS BRAYS THE HORSE
NEIGHS THE SHEEP BLEATS THE FEATHERED DENIZENS OF THE GROVE CALL TO
THEIR MATES IN MORE MUSICAL ROUNDELAYS
THESE ARE RECOGNIZED FACTS
GENTLEMEN WHICH YOU YOURSELVES AS DWELLERS AMONG NATURE IN THIS
BEAUTIFUL LAND ARE ALL COGNIZANT OF
THEY ARE FACTS THAT NO ONE WOULD
DENY AND WE SHOULD HAVE A POOR OPINION OF THE ASS WHO AT ER SUCH A
SUPREME MOMENT WOULD ATTEMPT TO SUGGEST THAT HIS CALL WAS UNTHINKING
AND WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE
BUT GENTLEMEN I SHALL PROVE TO YOU THAT
SUCH WAS THE FOOLISH SELF CONVICTING CUSTOM OF THE DEFENDANT
WITH
THE GREATEST RELUCTANCE AND THE ER GREATEST PAIN I SUCCEEDED IN
WRESTING FROM THE MAIDENLY MODESTY OF MY FAIR CLIENT THE INNOCENT
CONFESSION THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD INDUCED HER TO CORRESPOND WITH HIM
IN THESE METHODS
PICTURE TO YOURSELF GENTLEMEN THE LONELY MOONLIGHT
ROAD BESIDE THE WIDOW'S HUMBLE COTTAGE
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT
SANCTIFIED TO THE AFFECTIONS AND THE INNOCENT GIRL IS LEANING FROM
HER CASEMENT
PRESENTLY THERE APPEARS UPON THE ROAD A SLINKING
STEALTHY FIGURE THE DEFENDANT ON HIS WAY TO CHURCH
TRUE TO THE
INSTRUCTION SHE HAS RECEIVED FROM HIM HER LIPS PART IN THE MUSICAL
UTTERANCE THE COLONEL LOWERED HIS VOICE IN A FAINT FALSETTO
PRESUMABLY IN FOND IMITATION OF HIS FAIR CLIENT 'KERREE INSTANTLY
THE NIGHT BECAME RESONANT WITH THE IMPASSIONED REPLY THE COLONEL
HERE LIFTED HIS VOICE IN STENTORIAN TONES 'KERROW AGAIN AS HE
PASSES RISES THE SOFT 'KERREE' AGAIN AS HIS FORM IS LOST IN THE
DISTANCE COMES BACK THE DEEP 'KERROW
A BURST OF LAUGHTER LONG LOUD AND IRREPRESSIBLE STRUCK THE WHOLE
COURTROOM AND BEFORE THE JUDGE COULD LIFT HIS HALF COMPOSED FACE AND
TAKE HIS HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS MOUTH A FAINT KERREE FROM SOME
UNRECOGNIZED OBSCURITY OF THE COURTROOM WAS FOLLOWED BY A LOUD
KERROW FROM SOME OPPOSITE LOCALITY
THE SHERIFF WILL CLEAR THE
COURT SAID THE JUDGE STERNLY BUT ALAS AS THE EMBARRASSED AND
CHOKING OFFICIALS RUSHED HITHER AND THITHER A SOFT KERREE FROM THE
SPECTATORS AT THE WINDOW OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE WAS ANSWERED BY A
LOUD CHORUS OF KERROWS FROM THE OPPOSITE WINDOWS FILLED WITH
ONLOOKERS
AGAIN THE LAUGHTER AROSE EVERYWHERE EVEN THE FAIR
PLAINTIFF HERSELF SAT CONVULSED BEHIND HER HANDKERCHIEF
THE FIGURE OF COLONEL STARBOTTLE ALONE REMAINED ERECT WHITE AND
RIGID
AND THEN THE JUDGE LOOKING UP SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE IN THE
COURT HAD SEEN THAT THE COLONEL WAS SINCERE AND IN EARNEST THAT WHAT
HE HAD CONCEIVED TO BE THE PLEADER'S MOST PERFECT ACTING AND MOST
ELABORATE IRONY WERE THE DEEP SERIOUS MIRTHLESS CONVICTIONS OF A
MAN WITHOUT THE LEAST SENSE OF HUMOR
THERE WAS A TOUCH OF THIS
RESPECT IN THE JUDGE'S VOICE AS HE SAID TO HIM GENTLY YOU MAY
PROCEED COLONEL STARBOTTLE
I THANK YOUR HONOR SAID THE COLONEL SLOWLY FOR RECOGNIZING AND
DOING ALL IN YOUR POWER TO PREVENT AN INTERRUPTION THAT DURING MY
THIRTY YEARS' EXPERIENCE AT THE BAR I HAVE NEVER YET BEEN SUBJECTED
TO WITHOUT THE PRIVILEGE OF HOLDING THE INSTIGATORS THEREOF
RESPONSIBLE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE
IT IS POSSIBLY MY FAULT THAT I
HAVE FAILED ORATORICALLY TO CONVEY TO THE GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY THE
FULL FORCE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DEFENDANT'S SIGNALS
I AM AWARE
THAT MY VOICE IS SINGULARLY DEFICIENT IN PRODUCING EITHER THE DULCET
TONES OF MY FAIR CLIENT OR THE IMPASSIONED VEHEMENCE OF THE
DEFENDANT'S REPOSE
I WILL CONTINUED THE COLONEL WITH A FATIGUED
BUT BLIND FATUITY THAT IGNORED THE HURRIEDLY KNIT BROWS AND WARNING
EYES OF THE JUDGE TRY AGAIN
THE NOTE UTTERED BY MY CLIENT
LOWERING HIS VOICE TO THE FAINTEST OF FALSETTOS WAS 'KERREE' THE
RESPONSE WAS 'KERROW' AND THE COLONEL'S VOICE FAIRLY SHOOK THE DOME
ABOVE HIM
ANOTHER UPROAR OF LAUGHTER FOLLOWED THIS APPARENTLY AUDACIOUS
REPETITION BUT WAS INTERRUPTED BY AN UNLOOKED FOR INCIDENT
THE
DEFENDANT ROSE ABRUPTLY AND TEARING HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE WITHHOLDING
HAND AND PLEADING PROTESTATIONS OF HIS COUNSEL ABSOLUTELY FLED FROM
THE COURTROOM HIS APPEARANCE OUTSIDE BEING RECOGNIZED BY A PROLONGED
KERROW FROM THE BYSTANDERS WHICH AGAIN AND AGAIN FOLLOWED HIM IN
THE DISTANCE
IN THE MOMENTARY SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THE COLONEL'S
VOICE WAS HEARD SAYING WE REST HERE YOUR HONOR AND HE SAT DOWN
NO LESS WHITE BUT MORE AGITATED WAS THE FACE OF THE DEFENDANT'S
COUNSEL WHO INSTANTLY ROSE
FOR SOME UNEXPLAINED REASON YOUR HONOR MY CLIENT DESIRES TO SUSPEND
FURTHER PROCEEDINGS WITH A VIEW TO EFFECT A PEACEABLE COMPROMISE WITH
THE PLAINTIFF
AS HE IS A MAN OF WEALTH AND POSITION HE IS ABLE AND
WILLING TO PAY LIBERALLY FOR THAT PRIVILEGE
WHILE I AS HIS COUNSEL
AM STILL CONVINCED OF HIS LEGAL IRRESPONSIBILITY AS HE HAS CHOSEN
HOWEVER TO PUBLICLY ABANDON HIS RIGHTS HERE I CAN ONLY ASK YOUR
HONOR'S PERMISSION TO SUSPEND FURTHER PROCEEDINGS UNTIL I CAN CONFER
WITH COLONEL STARBOTTLE
AS FAR AS I CAN FOLLOW THE PLEADINGS SAID THE JUDGE GRAVELY THE
CASE SEEMS TO BE HARDLY ONE FOR LITIGATION AND I APPROVE OF THE
DEFENDANT'S COURSE WHILE I STRONGLY URGE THE PLAINTIFF TO ACCEPT IT
COLONEL STARBOTTLE BENT OVER HIS FAIR CLIENT
PRESENTLY HE ROSE
UNCHANGED IN LOOK OR DEMEANOR
I YIELD YOUR HONOR TO THE WISHES OF
MY CLIENT AND ER LADY
WE ACCEPT
BEFORE THE COURT ADJOURNED THAT DAY IT WAS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE TOWN
THAT ADONIRAM K
HOTCHKISS HAD COMPROMISED THE SUIT FOR FOUR THOUSAND
DOLLARS AND COSTS
COLONEL STARBOTTLE HAD SO FAR RECOVERED HIS EQUANIMITY AS TO STRUT
JAUNTILY TOWARDS HIS OFFICE WHERE HE WAS TO MEET HIS FAIR CLIENT
HE
WAS SURPRISED HOWEVER TO FIND HER ALREADY THERE AND IN COMPANY WITH
A SOMEWHAT SHEEPISH LOOKING YOUNG MAN A STRANGER
IF THE COLONEL HAD
ANY DISAPPOINTMENT IN MEETING A THIRD PARTY TO THE INTERVIEW HIS
OLD FASHIONED COURTESY DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO SHOW IT
HE BOWED
GRACIOUSLY AND POLITELY MOTIONED THEM EACH TO A SEAT
I RECKONED I'D BRING HIRAM ROUND WITH ME SAID THE YOUNG LADY
LIFTING HER SEARCHING EYES AFTER A PAUSE TO THE COLONEL'S THOUGH
HE WAS AWFUL SHY AND ALLOWED THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM FROM ADAM OR
EVEN SUSPECTED HIS EXISTENCE
BUT I SAID 'THAT'S JUST WHERE YOU SLIP
UP HIRAM A POW'FUL MAN LIKE THE COLONEL KNOWS EVERYTHING AND I'VE
SEEN IT IN HIS EYE LORDY SHE CONTINUED WITH A LAUGH LEANING
FORWARD OVER HER PARASOL AS HER EYES AGAIN SOUGHT THE COLONEL'S
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU ASKED ME IF I LOVED THAT OLD HOTCHKISS
AND I TOLD YOU 'THAT'S TELLIN' AND YOU LOOKED AT ME LORDY I KNEW
THEN YOU SUSPECTED THERE WAS A HIRAM SOMEWHERE AS GOOD AS IF I'D
TOLD YOU
NOW YOU JEST GET UP HIRAM AND GIVE THE COLONEL A GOOD
HANDSHAKE
FOR IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM AND HIS SEARCHIN' WAYS AND
HIS AWFUL POWER OF LANGUAGE I WOULDN'T HEV GOT THAT FOUR THOUSAND
DOLLARS OUT O' THAT FLIRTY FOOL HOTCHKISS ENOUGH TO BUY A FARM SO AS
YOU AND ME COULD GET MARRIED THAT'S WHAT YOU OWE TO HIM
DON'T
STAND THERE LIKE A STUCK FOOL STARIN' AT HIM
HE WON'T EAT YOU THOUGH
HE'S KILLED MANY A BETTER MAN
COME HAVE I GOT TO DO ALL THE
KISSIN'
IT IS OF RECORD THAT THE COLONEL BOWED SO COURTEOUSLY AND SO
PROFOUNDLY THAT HE MANAGED NOT MERELY TO EVADE THE PROFFERED HAND OF
THE SHY HIRAM BUT TO ONLY LIGHTLY TOUCH THE FRANKER AND MORE
IMPULSIVE FINGERTIPS OF THE GENTLE ZAIDEE
I ER OFFER MY SINCEREST
CONGRATULATIONS THOUGH I THINK YOU ER OVERESTIMATE MY ER POWERS
OF PENETRATION
UNFORTUNATELY A PRESSING ENGAGEMENT WHICH MAY OBLIGE
ME ALSO TO LEAVE TOWN TO NIGHT FORBIDS MY SAYING MORE
I
HAVE ER LEFT THE ER BUSINESS SETTLEMENT OF THIS ER CASE IN THE
HANDS OF THE LAWYERS WHO DO MY OFFICE WORK AND WHO WILL SHOW YOU
EVERY ATTENTION
AND NOW LET ME WISH YOU A VERY GOOD AFTERNOON
NEVERTHELESS THE COLONEL RETURNED TO HIS PRIVATE ROOM AND IT WAS
NEARLY TWILIGHT WHEN THE FAITHFUL JIM ENTERED TO FIND HIM SITTING
MEDITATIVELY BEFORE HIS DESK
'FO' GOD KERNEL I HOPE DEY AIN'T
NUFFIN DE MATTER BUT YOU'S LOOKIN' MIGHTLY SOLEMN I AIN'T SEEN YOU
LOOK DAT WAY KERNEL SINCE DE DAY POOH MARSE STRYKER WAS FETCHED HOME
SHOT FROO DE HEAD
HAND ME DOWN THE WHISKEY JIM SAID THE COLONEL RISING SLOWLY
THE NEGRO FLEW TO THE CLOSET JOYFULLY AND BROUGHT OUT THE BOTTLE
THE
COLONEL POURED OUT A GLASS OF THE SPIRIT AND DRANK IT WITH HIS OLD
DELIBERATION
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT JIM HE SAID PUTTING DOWN HIS GLASS BUT
I'M ER GETTING OLD AND SOMEHOW I AM MISSING POOR STRYKER

QUIETEST AVENUES
IT WAS AN OLD FASHIONED BRICK BUILDING WITH A
PORTICO UPHELD BY TALL WHITE PILLARS
THE YARD WAS SHADED BY STATELY
LOCUSTS AND ELMS AND A CATALPA TREE IN SEASON RAINED ITS PINK AND
WHITE BLOSSOMS UPON THE GRASS
ROWS OF HIGH BOX BUSHES LINED THE FENCE
AND WALKS
IT WAS THE SOUTHERN STYLE AND ASPECT OF THE PLACE THAT
PLEASED THE EYES OF THE TALBOTS
IN THIS PLEASANT PRIVATE BOARDING HOUSE THEY ENGAGED ROOMS INCLUDING
A STUDY FOR MAJOR TALBOT WHO WAS ADDING THE FINISHING CHAPTERS TO HIS
BOOK ANECDOTES AND REMINISCENCES OF THE ALABAMA ARMY BENCH AND
BAR
MAJOR TALBOT WAS OF THE OLD OLD SOUTH
THE PRESENT DAY HAD LITTLE
INTEREST OR EXCELLENCE IN HIS EYES
HIS MIND LIVED IN THAT PERIOD
BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR WHEN THE TALBOTS OWNED THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FINE
COTTON LAND AND THE SLAVES TO TILL THEM WHEN THE FAMILY MANSION WAS
THE SCENE OF PRINCELY HOSPITALITY AND DREW ITS GUESTS FROM THE
ARISTOCRACY OF THE SOUTH
OUT OF THAT PERIOD HE HAD BROUGHT ALL ITS
OLD PRIDE AND SCRUPLES OF HONOR AN ANTIQUATED AND PUNCTILIOUS
POLITENESS AND YOU WOULD THINK ITS WARDROBE
SUCH CLOTHES WERE SURELY NEVER MADE WITHIN FIFTY YEARS
THE MAJOR WAS
TALL BUT WHENEVER HE MADE THAT WONDERFUL ARCHAIC GENUFLEXION HE
CALLED A BOW THE CORNERS OF HIS FROCK COAT SWEPT THE FLOOR
THAT
GARMENT WAS A SURPRISE EVEN TO WASHINGTON WHICH HAS LONG AGO CEASED
TO SHY AT THE FROCKS AND BROAD BRIMMED HATS OF SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN
ONE OF THE BOARDERS CHRISTENED IT A FATHER HUBBARD AND IT CERTAINLY
WAS HIGH IN THE WAIST AND FULL IN THE SKIRT
BUT THE MAJOR WITH ALL HIS QUEER CLOTHES HIS IMMENSE AREA OF
PLAITED RAVELING SHIRT BOSOM AND THE LITTLE BLACK STRING TIE WITH
THE BOW ALWAYS SLIPPING ON ONE SIDE BOTH WAS SMILED AT AND LIKED IN
MRS
VARDEMAN'S SELECT BOARDING HOUSE
SOME OF THE YOUNG DEPARTMENT
CLERKS WOULD OFTEN STRING HIM AS THEY CALLED IT GETTING HIM
STARTED UPON THE SUBJECT DEAREST TO HIM THE TRADITIONS AND HISTORY OF
HIS BELOVED SOUTHLAND
DURING HIS TALKS HE WOULD QUOTE FREELY FROM THE
ANECDOTES AND REMINISCENCES
BUT THEY WERE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO LET
HIM SEE THEIR DESIGNS FOR IN SPITE OF HIS SIXTY EIGHT YEARS HE COULD
MAKE THE BOLDEST OF THEM UNCOMFORTABLE UNDER THE STEADY REGARD OF HIS
PIERCING GRAY EYES
MISS LYDIA WAS A PLUMP LITTLE OLD MAID OF THIRTY FIVE WITH SMOOTHLY
DRAWN TIGHTLY TWISTED HAIR THAT MADE HER LOOK STILL OLDER
OLD FASHIONED TOO SHE WAS BUT ANTEBELLUM GLORY DID NOT RADIATE FROM
HER AS IT DID FROM THE MAJOR
SHE POSSESSED A THRIFTY COMMON SENSE
AND IT WAS SHE WHO HANDLED THE FINANCES OF THE FAMILY AND MET ALL
COMERS WHEN THERE WERE BILLS TO PAY
THE MAJOR REGARDED BOARD BILLS
AND WASH BILLS AS CONTEMPTIBLE NUISANCES
THEY KEPT COMING IN SO
PERSISTENTLY AND SO OFTEN
WHY THE MAJOR WANTED TO KNOW COULD THEY
NOT BE FILED AND PAID IN A LUMP SUM AT SOME CONVENIENT PERIOD SAY
WHEN THE ANECDOTES AND REMINISCENCES HAD BEEN PUBLISHED AND PAID
FOR MISS LYDIA WOULD CALMLY GO ON WITH HER SEWING AND SAY WE'LL PAY
AS WE GO AS LONG AS THE MONEY LASTS AND THEN PERHAPS THEY'LL HAVE TO
LUMP IT
MOST OF MRS
VARDEMAN'S BOARDERS WERE AWAY DURING THE DAY BEING
NEARLY ALL DEPARTMENT CLERKS AND BUSINESS MEN BUT THERE WAS ONE OF
THEM WHO WAS ABOUT THE HOUSE A GREAT DEAL FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
THIS
WAS A YOUNG MAN NAMED HENRY HOPKINS HARGRAVES EVERY ONE IN THE HOUSE
ADDRESSED HIM BY HIS FULL NAME WHO WAS ENGAGED AT ONE OF THE POPULAR
VAUDEVILLE THEATERS
VAUDEVILLE HAS RISEN TO SUCH A RESPECTABLE PLANE
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND MR
HARGRAVES WAS SUCH A MODEST AND
WELL MANNERED PERSON THAT MRS
VARDEMAN COULD FIND NO OBJECTION TO
ENROLLING HIM UPON HER LIST OF BOARDERS
AT THE THEATER HARGRAVES WAS KNOWN AS AN ALL ROUND DIALECT COMEDIAN
HAVING A LARGE REPERTOIRE OF GERMAN IRISH SWEDE AND BLACK FACE
SPECIALTIES
BUT MR
HARGRAVES WAS AMBITIOUS AND OFTEN SPOKE OF HIS
GREAT DESIRE TO SUCCEED IN LEGITIMATE COMEDY
THIS YOUNG MAN APPEARED TO CONCEIVE A STRONG FANCY FOR MAJOR TALBOT
WHENEVER THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD BEGIN HIS SOUTHERN REMINISCENCES OR
REPEAT SOME OF THE LIVELIEST OF THE ANECDOTES HARGRAVES COULD ALWAYS
BE FOUND THE MOST ATTENTIVE AMONG HIS LISTENERS
FOR A TIME THE MAJOR SHOWED AN INCLINATION TO DISCOURAGE THE ADVANCES
OF THE PLAY ACTOR AS HE PRIVATELY TERMED HIM BUT SOON THE YOUNG
MAN'S AGREEABLE MANNER AND INDUBITABLE APPRECIATION OF THE OLD
GENTLEMAN'S STORIES COMPLETELY WON HIM OVER
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE TWO WERE LIKE OLD CHUMS
THE MAJOR SET
APART EACH AFTERNOON TO READ TO HIM THE MANUSCRIPT OF HIS BOOK
DURING
THE ANECDOTES HARGRAVES NEVER FAILED TO LAUGH AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT
POINT
THE MAJOR WAS MOVED TO DECLARE TO MISS LYDIA ONE DAY THAT YOUNG
HARGRAVES POSSESSED REMARKABLE PERCEPTION AND A GRATIFYING RESPECT FOR
THE OLD RGIME
AND WHEN IT CAME TO TALKING OF THOSE OLD DAYS IF
MAJOR TALBOT LIKED TO TALK MR
HARGRAVES WAS ENTRANCED TO LISTEN
LIKE ALMOST ALL OLD PEOPLE WHO TALK OF THE PAST THE MAJOR LOVED TO
LINGER OVER DETAILS
IN DESCRIBING THE SPLENDID ALMOST ROYAL DAYS OF
THE OLD PLANTERS HE WOULD HESITATE UNTIL HE HAD RECALLED THE NAME OF
THE NEGRO WHO HELD HIS HORSE OR THE EXACT DATE OF CERTAIN MINOR
HAPPENINGS OR THE NUMBER OF BALES OF COTTON RAISED IN SUCH A YEAR
BUT HARGRAVES NEVER GREW IMPATIENT OR LOST INTEREST
ON THE CONTRARY
HE WOULD ADVANCE QUESTIONS ON A VARIETY OF SUBJECTS CONNECTED WITH THE
LIFE OF THAT TIME AND HE NEVER FAILED TO EXTRACT READY REPLIES
THE FOX HUNTS THE 'POSSUM SUPPERS THE HOE DOWNS AND JUBILEES IN THE
NEGRO QUARTERS THE BANQUETS IN THE PLANTATION HOUSE HALL WHEN
INVITATIONS WENT FOR FIFTY MILES AROUND THE OCCASIONAL FEUDS WITH THE
NEIGHBORING GENTRY THE MAJOR'S DUEL WITH RATHBONE CULBERTSON ABOUT
KITTY CHALMERS WHO AFTERWARD MARRIED A THWAITE OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND
PRIVATE YACHT RACES FOR FABULOUS SUMS ON MOBILE BAY THE QUAINT
BELIEFS IMPROVIDENT HABITS AND LOYAL VIRTUES OF THE OLD SLAVES ALL
THESE WERE SUBJECTS THAT HELD BOTH THE MAJOR AND HARGRAVES ABSORBED
FOR HOURS AT A TIME
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE COMING UPSTAIRS TO
HIS ROOM AFTER HIS TURN AT THE THEATER WAS OVER THE MAJOR WOULD
APPEAR AT THE DOOR OF HIS STUDY AND BECKON ARCHLY TO HIM
GOING IN
HARGRAVES WOULD FIND A LITTLE TABLE SET WITH A DECANTER SUGAR BOWL
FRUIT AND A BIG BUNCH OF FRESH GREEN MINT
IT OCCURRED TO ME THE MAJOR WOULD BEGIN HE WAS ALWAYS
CEREMONIOUS THAT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOUND YOUR DUTIES AT THE AT
YOUR PLACE OF OCCUPATION SUFFICIENTLY ARDUOUS TO ENABLE YOU MR
HARGRAVES TO APPRECIATE WHAT THE POET MIGHT WELL HAVE HAD IN HIS MIND
WHEN HE WROTE 'TIRED NATURE'S SWEET RESTORER' ONE OF OUR SOUTHERN
JULEPS
IT WAS A FASCINATION TO HARGRAVES TO WATCH HIM MAKE IT
HE TOOK RANK
AMONG ARTISTS WHEN HE BEGAN AND HE NEVER VARIED THE PROCESS
WITH
WHAT DELICACY HE BRUISED THE MINT WITH WHAT EXQUISITE NICETY HE
ESTIMATED THE INGREDIENTS WITH WHAT SOLICITOUS CARE HE CAPPED THE
COMPOUND WITH THE SCARLET FRUIT GLOWING AGAINST THE DARK GREEN FRINGE
AND THEN THE HOSPITALITY AND GRACE WITH WHICH HE OFFERED IT AFTER THE
SELECTED OAT STRAWS HAD BEEN PLUNGED INTO ITS TINKLING DEPTHS
AFTER ABOUT FOUR MONTHS IN WASHINGTON MISS LYDIA DISCOVERED ONE
MORNING THAT THEY WERE ALMOST WITHOUT MONEY
THE ANECDOTES AND
REMINISCENCES WAS COMPLETED BUT PUBLISHERS HAD NOT JUMPED AT THE
COLLECTED GEMS OF ALABAMA SENSE AND WIT
THE RENTAL OF A SMALL HOUSE
WHICH THEY STILL OWNED IN MOBILE WAS TWO MONTHS IN ARREARS
THEIR
BOARD MONEY FOR THE MONTH WOULD BE DUE IN THREE DAYS
MISS LYDIA
CALLED HER FATHER TO A CONSULTATION
NO MONEY SAID HE WITH A SURPRISED LOOK
IT IS QUITE ANNOYING TO BE
CALLED ON SO FREQUENTLY FOR THESE PETTY SUMS REALLY I
THE MAJOR SEARCHED HIS POCKETS
HE FOUND ONLY A TWO DOLLAR BILL WHICH
HE RETURNED TO HIS VEST POCKET
I MUST ATTEND TO THIS AT ONCE LYDIA HE SAID
KINDLY GET ME MY
UMBRELLA AND I WILL GO DOWNTOWN IMMEDIATELY
THE CONGRESSMAN FROM OUR
DISTRICT GENERAL FULGHUM ASSURED ME SOME DAYS AGO THAT HE WOULD USE
HIS INFLUENCE TO GET MY BOOK PUBLISHED AT AN EARLY DATE
I WILL GO TO
HIS HOTEL AT ONCE AND SEE WHAT ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE
WITH A SAD LITTLE SMILE MISS LYDIA WATCHED HIM BUTTON HIS FATHER
HUBBARD AND DEPART PAUSING AT THE DOOR AS HE ALWAYS DID TO BOW
PROFOUNDLY
THAT EVENING AT DARK HE RETURNED
IT SEEMED THAT CONGRESSMAN FULGHUM
HAD SEEN THE PUBLISHER WHO HAD THE MAJOR'S MANUSCRIPT FOR READING
THAT PERSON HAD SAID THAT IF THE ANECDOTES ETC WERE CAREFULLY
PRUNED DOWN ABOUT ONE HALF IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE SECTIONAL AND
CLASS PREJUDICE WITH WHICH THE BOOK WAS DYED FROM END TO END HE MIGHT
CONSIDER ITS PUBLICATION
THE MAJOR WAS IN A WHITE HEAT OF ANGER BUT REGAINED HIS EQUANIMITY
ACCORDING TO HIS CODE OF MANNERS AS SOON AS HE WAS IN MISS LYDIA'S
PRESENCE
WE MUST HAVE MONEY SAID MISS LYDIA WITH A LITTLE WRINKLE ABOVE HER
NOSE
GIVE ME THE TWO DOLLARS AND I WILL TELEGRAPH TO UNCLE RALPH
FOR SOME TO NIGHT
THE MAJOR DREW A SMALL ENVELOPE FROM HIS UPPER VEST POCKET AND TOSSED
IT ON THE TABLE
PERHAPS IT WAS INJUDICIOUS HE SAID MILDLY BUT THE SUM WAS SO
MERELY NOMINAL THAT I BOUGHT TICKETS TO THE THEATER TO NIGHT
IT'S A
NEW WAR DRAMA LYDIA
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE PLEASED TO WITNESS ITS
FIRST PRODUCTION IN WASHINGTON
I AM TOLD THAT THE SOUTH HAS VERY FAIR
TREATMENT IN THE PLAY
I CONFESS I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PERFORMANCE
MYSELF
MISS LYDIA THREW UP HER HANDS IN SILENT DESPAIR
STILL AS THE TICKETS WERE BOUGHT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE USED
SO THAT
EVENING AS THEY SAT IN THE THEATER LISTENING TO THE LIVELY OVERTURE
EVEN MISS LYDIA WAS MINDED TO RELEGATE THEIR TROUBLES FOR THE HOUR
TO SECOND PLACE
THE MAJOR IN SPOTLESS LINEN WITH HIS EXTRAORDINARY
COAT SHOWING ONLY WHERE IT WAS CLOSELY BUTTONED AND HIS WHITE HAIR
SMOOTHLY ROACHED LOOKED REALLY FINE AND DISTINGUISHED
THE CURTAIN
WENT UP ON THE FIRST ACT OF A MAGNOLIA FLOWER REVEALING A TYPICAL
SOUTHERN PLANTATION SCENE
MAJOR TALBOT BETRAYED SOME INTEREST
OH SEE EXCLAIMED MISS LYDIA NUDGING HIS ARM AND POINTING TO HER
PROGRAM
THE MAJOR PUT ON HIS GLASSES AND READ THE LINE IN THE CAST OF
CHARACTERS THAT HER FINGERS INDICATED
COL
WEBSTER CALHOUN
MR
HOPKINS HARGRAVES
IT'S OUR MR
HARGRAVES SAID MISS LYDIA
IT MUST BE HIS FIRST
APPEARANCE IN WHAT HE CALLS 'THE LEGITIMATE I'M SO GLAD FOR HIM
NOT UNTIL THE SECOND ACT DID COL
WEBSTER CALHOUN APPEAR UPON THE
STAGE
WHEN HE MADE HIS ENTRY MAJOR TALBOT GAVE AN AUDIBLE SNIFF
GLARED AT HIM AND SEEMED TO FREEZE SOLID
MISS LYDIA UTTERED A
LITTLE AMBIGUOUS SQUEAK AND CRUMPLED HER PROGRAM IN HER HAND
FOR
COLONEL CALHOUN WAS MADE UP AS NEARLY RESEMBLING MAJOR TALBOT AS ONE
PEA DOES ANOTHER
THE LONG THIN WHITE HAIR CURLY AT THE ENDS THE
ARISTOCRATIC BEAK OF A NOSE THE CRUMPLED WIDE RAVELING SHIRT FRONT
THE STRING TIE WITH THE BOW NEARLY UNDER ONE EAR WERE ALMOST EXACTLY
DUPLICATED
AND THEN TO CLINCH THE IMITATION HE WORE THE TWIN TO THE
MAJOR'S SUPPOSED TO BE UNPARALLELED COAT
HIGH COLLARED BAGGY
EMPIRE WAISTED AMPLE SKIRTED HANGING A FOOT LOWER IN FRONT THAN
BEHIND THE GARMENT COULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED FROM NO OTHER PATTERN
FROM THEN ON THE MAJOR AND MISS LYDIA SAT BEWITCHED AND SAW THE
COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF A HAUGHTY TALBOT DRAGGED AS THE MAJOR
AFTERWARD EXPRESSED IT THROUGH THE SLANDEROUS MIRE OF A CORRUPT
STAGE
MR
HARGRAVES HAD USED HIS OPPORTUNITIES WELL
HE HAD CAUGHT THE
MAJOR'S LITTLE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF SPEECH ACCENT AND INTONATION AND
HIS POMPOUS COURTLINESS TO PERFECTION EXAGGERATING ALL TO THE PURPOSE
OF THE STAGE
WHEN HE PERFORMED THAT MARVELOUS BOW THAT THE MAJOR
FONDLY IMAGINED TO BE THE PINK OF ALL SALUTATIONS THE AUDIENCE SENT
FORTH A SUDDEN ROUND OF HEARTY APPLAUSE
MISS LYDIA SAT IMMOVABLE NOT DARING TO GLANCE TOWARD HER FATHER
SOMETIMES HER HAND NEXT TO HIM WOULD BE LAID AGAINST HER CHEEK AS IF
TO CONCEAL THE SMILE WHICH IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPROVAL SHE COULD NOT
ENTIRELY SUPPRESS
THE CULMINATION OF HARGRAVES AUDACIOUS IMITATION TOOK PLACE IN THE
THIRD ACT
THE SCENE IS WHERE COLONEL CALHOUN ENTERTAINS A FEW OF THE
NEIGHBORING PLANTERS IN HIS DEN
STANDING AT A TABLE IN THE CENTER OF THE STAGE WITH HIS FRIENDS
GROUPED ABOUT HIM HE DELIVERS THAT INIMITABLE RAMBLING CHARACTER
MONOLOGUE SO FAMOUS IN A MAGNOLIA FLOWER AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE
DEFTLY MAKES JULEPS FOR THE PARTY
MAJOR TALBOT SITTING QUIETLY BUT WHITE WITH INDIGNATION HEARD HIS
BEST STORIES RETOLD HIS PET THEORIES AND HOBBIES ADVANCED AND
EXPANDED AND THE DREAM OF THE ANECDOTES AND REMINISCENCES SERVED
EXAGGERATED AND GARBLED
HIS FAVORITE NARRATIVE THAT OF HIS DUEL WITH
RATHBONE CULBERTSON WAS NOT OMITTED AND IT WAS DELIVERED WITH MORE
FIRE EGOTISM AND GUSTO THAN THE MAJOR HIMSELF PUT INTO IT
THE MONOLOGUE CONCLUDED WITH A QUAINT DELICIOUS WITTY LITTLE LECTURE
ON THE ART OF CONCOCTING A JULEP ILLUSTRATED BY THE ACT
HERE MAJOR
TALBOT'S DELICATE BUT SHOWY SCIENCE WAS REPRODUCED TO A HAIR'S
BREADTH FROM HIS DAINTY HANDLING OF THE FRAGRANT WEED THE
ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF A GRAIN TOO MUCH PRESSURE GENTLEMEN AND YOU
EXTRACT THE BITTERNESS INSTEAD OF THE AROMA OF THIS HEAVEN BESTOWED
PLANT TO HIS SOLICITOUS SELECTION OF THE OATEN STRAWS
AT THE CLOSE OF THE SCENE THE AUDIENCE RAISED A TUMULTUOUS ROAR OF
APPRECIATION
THE PORTRAYAL OF THE TYPE WAS SO EXACT SO SURE AND
THOROUGH THAT THE LEADING CHARACTERS IN THE PLAY WERE FORGOTTEN
AFTER REPEATED CALLS HARGRAVES CAME BEFORE THE CURTAIN AND BOWED HIS
RATHER BOYISH FACE BRIGHT AND FLUSHED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF SUCCESS
AT LAST MISS LYDIA TURNED AND LOOKED AT THE MAJOR
HIS THIN NOSTRILS
WERE WORKING LIKE THE GILLS OF A FISH
HE LAID BOTH SHAKING HANDS UPON
THE ARMS OF HIS CHAIR TO RISE
WE WILL GO LYDIA HE SAID CHOKINGLY
THIS IS AN
ABOMINABLE DESECRATION
BEFORE HE COULD RISE SHE PULLED HIM BACK INTO HIS SEAT
WE WILL STAY IT OUT SHE DECLARED
DO YOU WANT TO ADVERTISE THE
COPY BY EXHIBITING THE ORIGINAL COAT SO THEY REMAINED TO THE END
HARGRAVES'S SUCCESS MUST HAVE KEPT HIM UP LATE THAT NIGHT FOR NEITHER
AT THE BREAKFAST NOR AT THE DINNER TABLE DID HE APPEAR
ABOUT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON HE TAPPED AT THE DOOR OF MAJOR TALBOT'S
STUDY
THE MAJOR OPENED IT AND HARGRAVES WALKED IN WITH HIS HANDS
FULL OF THE MORNING PAPERS TOO FULL OF HIS TRIUMPH TO NOTICE ANYTHING
UNUSUAL IN THE MAJOR'S DEMEANOR
I PUT IT ALL OVER 'EM LAST NIGHT MAJOR HE BEGAN EXULTANTLY
I HAD
MY INNING AND I THINK SCORED
HERE'S WHAT THE POST SAYS
'HIS CONCEPTION AND PORTRAYAL OF THE OLD TIME SOUTHERN COLONEL WITH
HIS ABSURD GRANDILOQUENCE HIS ECCENTRIC GARB HIS QUAINT IDIOMS AND
PHRASES HIS MOTHEATEN PRIDE OF FAMILY AND HIS REALLY KIND HEART
FASTIDIOUS SENSE OF HONOR AND LOVABLE SIMPLICITY IS THE BEST
DELINEATION OF A CHARACTER ROLE ON THE BOARDS TO DAY
THE COAT WORN BY
COLONEL CALHOUN IS ITSELF NOTHING LESS THAN AN EVOLUTION OF GENIUS
MR
HARGRAVES HAS CAPTURED HIS PUBLIC
HOW DOES THAT SOUND MAJOR FOR A FIRST NIGHTER
I HAD THE HONOR THE MAJOR'S VOICE SOUNDED OMINOUSLY FRIGID OF
WITNESSING YOUR VERY REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE SIR LAST NIGHT
HARGRAVES LOOKED DISCONCERTED
YOU WERE THERE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU EVER I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CARED FOR
THE THEATER
OH I SAY MAJOR TALBOT HE EXCLAIMED FRANKLY DON'T
YOU BE OFFENDED
I ADMIT I DID GET A LOT OF POINTERS FROM YOU THAT
HELPED OUT WONDERFULLY IN THE PART
BUT IT'S A TYPE YOU KNOW NOT
INDIVIDUAL
THE WAY THE AUDIENCE CAUGHT ON SHOWS THAT
HALF THE
PATRONS OF THAT THEATER ARE SOUTHERNERS
THEY RECOGNIZED IT
MR
HARGRAVES SAID THE MAJOR WHO HAD REMAINED STANDING YOU HAVE
PUT UPON ME AN UNPARDONABLE INSULT
YOU HAVE BURLESQUED MY PERSON
GROSSLY BETRAYED MY CONFIDENCE AND MISUSED MY HOSPITALITY
IF I
THOUGHT YOU POSSESSED THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION OF WHAT IS THE SIGN
MANUAL OF A GENTLEMAN OR WHAT IS DUE ONE I WOULD CALL YOU OUT SIR
OLD AS I AM
I WILL ASK YOU TO LEAVE THE ROOM SIR
THE ACTOR APPEARED TO BE SLIGHTLY BEWILDERED AND SEEMED HARDLY TO
TAKE IN THE FULL MEANING OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S WORDS
I AM TRULY SORRY YOU TOOK OFFENSE HE SAID REGRETFULLY
UP HERE WE
DON'T LOOK AT THINGS JUST AS YOU PEOPLE DO
I KNOW MEN WHO WOULD BUY
OUT HALF THE HOUSE TO HAVE THEIR PERSONALITY PUT ON THE STAGE SO THE
PUBLIC WOULD RECOGNIZE IT
THEY ARE NOT FROM ALABAMA SIR SAID THE MAJOR HAUGHTILY
PERHAPS NOT
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD MEMORY MAJOR LET ME QUOTE A FEW
LINES FROM YOUR BOOK
IN RESPONSE TO A TOAST AT A BANQUET GIVEN
IN MILLEDGEVILLE I BELIEVE YOU UTTERED AND INTEND TO HAVE PRINTED
THESE WORDS
'THE NORTHERN MAN IS UTTERLY WITHOUT SENTIMENT OR WARMTH EXCEPT IN SO
FAR AS THE FEELINGS MAY BE TURNED TO HIS OWN COMMERCIAL PROFIT
HE
WILL SUFFER WITHOUT RESENTMENT ANY IMPUTATION CAST UPON THE HONOR OF
HIMSELF OR HIS LOVED ONES THAT DOES NOT BEAR WITH IT THE CONSEQUENCE
OF PECUNIARY LOSS
IN HIS CHARITY HE GIVES WITH A LIBERAL HAND BUT
IT MUST BE HERALDED WITH THE TRUMPET AND CHRONICLED IN BRASS
DO YOU THINK THAT PICTURE IS FAIRER THAN THE ONE YOU SAW OF COLONEL
CALHOUN LAST NIGHT
THE DESCRIPTION SAID THE MAJOR FROWNING IS NOT WITHOUT GROUNDS
SOME EXAG LATITUDE MUST BE ALLOWED IN PUBLIC SPEAKING
AND IN PUBLIC ACTING REPLIED HARGRAVES
THAT IS NOT THE POINT PERSISTED THE MAJOR UNRELENTING
IT WAS A
PERSONAL CARICATURE
I POSITIVELY DECLINE TO OVERLOOK IT SIR
MAJOR TALBOT SAID HARGRAVES WITH A WINNING SMILE I WISH YOU
WOULD UNDERSTAND ME
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I NEVER DREAMED OF
INSULTING YOU
IN MY PROFESSION ALL LIFE BELONGS TO ME
I TAKE WHAT I
WANT AND WHAT I CAN AND RETURN IT OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS
NOW IF YOU
WILL LET'S LET IT GO AT THAT
I CAME IN TO SEE YOU ABOUT SOMETHING
ELSE
WE'VE BEEN PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS FOR SOME MONTHS AND I'M GOING TO
TAKE THE RISK OF OFFENDING YOU AGAIN
I KNOW YOU ARE HARD UP FOR
MONEY NEVER MIND HOW I FOUND OUT A BOARDING HOUSE IS NO PLACE TO
KEEP SUCH MATTERS SECRET AND I WANT YOU TO LET ME HELP YOU OUT OF THE
PINCH
I'VE BEEN THERE OFTEN ENOUGH MYSELF
I'VE BEEN GETTING A FAIR
SALARY ALL THE SEASON AND I'VE SAVED SOME MONEY
YOU'RE WELCOME TO A
COUPLE HUNDRED OR EVEN MORE UNTIL YOU GET
STOP COMMANDED THE MAJOR WITH HIS ARM OUTSTRETCHED
IT SEEMS THAT
MY BOOK DIDN'T LIE AFTER ALL
YOU THINK YOUR MONEY SALVE WILL HEAL
ALL THE HURTS OF HONOR
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I ACCEPT A LOAN
FROM A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE AND AS TO YOU SIR I WOULD STARVE BEFORE
I WOULD CONSIDER YOUR INSULTING OFFER OF A FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENT OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE DISCUSSED
I BEG TO REPEAT MY REQUEST RELATIVE
TO YOUR QUITTING THE APARTMENT
HARGRAVES TOOK HIS DEPARTURE WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
HE ALSO LEFT THE
HOUSE THE SAME DAY MOVING AS MRS
VARDEMAN EXPLAINED AT THE SUPPER
TABLE NEARER THE VICINITY OF THE DOWNTOWN THEATER WHERE A MAGNOLIA
FLOWER WAS BOOKED FOR A WEEK'S RUN
CRITICAL WAS THE SITUATION WITH MAJOR TALBOT AND MISS LYDIA
THERE WAS
NO ONE IN WASHINGTON TO WHOM THE MAJOR'S SCRUPLES ALLOWED HIM TO APPLY
FOR A LOAN
MISS LYDIA WROTE A LETTER TO UNCLE RALPH BUT IT WAS
DOUBTFUL WHETHER THAT RELATIVE'S CONSTRICTED AFFAIRS WOULD PERMIT HIM
TO FURNISH HELP
THE MAJOR WAS FORCED TO MAKE AN APOLOGETIC ADDRESS TO
MRS
VARDEMAN REGARDING THE DELAYED PAYMENT FOR BOARD REFERRING TO
DELINQUENT RENTALS AND DELAYED REMITTANCES IN A RATHER CONFUSED
STRAIN
DELIVERANCE CAME FROM AN ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED SOURCE
LATE ONE AFTERNOON THE DOOR MAID CAME UP AND ANNOUNCED AN OLD COLORED
MAN WHO WANTED TO SEE MAJOR TALBOT
THE MAJOR ASKED THAT HE BE SENT UP
TO HIS STUDY
SOON AN OLD DARKEY APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY WITH HIS HAT
IN HAND BOWING AND SCRAPING WITH ONE CLUMSY FOOT
HE WAS QUITE
DECENTLY DRESSED IN A BAGGY SUIT OF BLACK
HIS BIG COARSE SHOES SHONE
WITH A METALLIC LUSTER SUGGESTIVE OF STOVE POLISH
HIS BUSHY WOOL WAS
GRAY ALMOST WHITE
AFTER MIDDLE LIFE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE
AGE OF A NEGRO
THIS ONE MIGHT HAVE SEEN AS MANY YEARS AS HAD MAJOR
TALBOT
I BE BOUND YOU DON'T KNOW ME MARS' PENDLETON WERE HIS FIRST WORDS
THE MAJOR ROSE AND CAME FORWARD AT THE OLD FAMILIAR STYLE OF ADDRESS
IT WAS ONE OF THE OLD PLANTATION DARKEYS WITHOUT A DOUBT BUT THEY HAD
BEEN WIDELY SCATTERED AND HE COULD NOT RECALL THE VOICE OR FACE
I DON'T BELIEVE I DO HE SAID KINDLY UNLESS YOU WILL ASSIST MY
MEMORY
DON'T YOU 'MEMBER CINDY'S MOSE MARS' PENDLETON WHAT 'MIGRATED

SOMETHING ALIVE AND TANGIBLE HAD
COME TO LINK THEM WITH THE HAPPY PAST
THE THREE SAT AND TALKED OVER
THE OLDEN TIMES THE MAJOR AND UNCLE MOSE CORRECTING OR PROMPTING EACH

THE MAJOR INQUIRED WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS DOING SO FAR FROM HIS HOME

HIT BELONGS TO YOU
HIT'S TALBOT

AFTER UNCLE MOSE HAD GONE MISS LYDIA HAD A GOOD CRY FOR JOY AND
THE MAJOR TURNED HIS FACE TO A CORNER AND SMOKED HIS CLAY PIPE
VOLCANICALLY
THE SUCCEEDING DAYS SAW THE TALBOTS RESTORED TO PEACE AND EASE
MISS
LYDIA'S FACE LOST ITS WORRIED LOOK
THE MAJOR APPEARED IN A NEW FROCK
COAT IN WHICH HE LOOKED LIKE A WAX FIGURE PERSONIFYING THE MEMORY OF
HIS GOLDEN AGE
ANOTHER PUBLISHER WHO READ THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE
ANECDOTES AND REMINISCENCES THOUGHT THAT WITH A LITTLE RETOUCHING
AND TONING DOWN OF THE HIGH LIGHTS HE COULD MAKE A REALLY BRIGHT AND
SALABLE VOLUME OF IT
ALTOGETHER THE SITUATION WAS COMFORTABLE AND
NOT WITHOUT THE TOUCH OF HOPE THAT IS OFTEN SWEETER THAN ARRIVED
BLESSINGS
ONE DAY ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THEIR PIECE OF GOOD LUCK A MAID BROUGHT A
LETTER FOR MISS LYDIA TO HER ROOM
THE POSTMARK SHOWED THAT IT WAS
FROM NEW YORK
NOT KNOWING ANY ONE THERE MISS LYDIA IN A MILD
FLUTTER OF WONDER SAT DOWN BY HER TABLE AND OPENED THE LETTER WITH
HER SCISSORS
THIS WAS WHAT SHE READ
DEAR MISS TALBOT
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO LEARN OF MY GOOD FORTUNE
I HAVE
RECEIVED AND ACCEPTED AN OFFER OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER WEEK BY A
NEW YORK STOCK COMPANY TO PLAY COLONEL CALHOUN IN A MAGNOLIA FLOWER
THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
I GUESS YOU'D BETTER NOT
TELL MAJOR TALBOT
I WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE HIM SOME AMENDS FOR THE GREAT
HELP HE WAS TO ME IN STUDYING THE PART AND FOR THE BAD HUMOR HE WAS
IN ABOUT IT
HE REFUSED TO LET ME SO I DID IT ANYHOW
I COULD EASILY
SPARE THE THREE HUNDRED
SINCERELY YOURS
H
HOPKINS HARGRAVES
P S
HOW DID I PLAY UNCLE MOSE
MAJOR TALBOT PASSING THROUGH THE HALL SAW MISS LYDIA'S DOOR OPEN AND
STOPPED
ANY MAIL FOR US THIS MORNING LYDIA DEAR HE ASKED
MISS LYDIA SLID THE LETTER BENEATH A FOLD OF HER DRESS
THE MOBILE CHRONICLE CAME SHE SAID PROMPTLY

I
JUST AS THE STAGE RUMBLED OVER THE RICKETY OLD BRIDGE CREAKING AND
GROANING THE SUN CAME FROM BEHIND THE CLOUDS THAT HAD FROWNED ALL THE

THE TWO RICHLY DRESSED
MATRONS WHO HAD BEEN SO UTTERLY AND UNNECESSARILY OBLIVIOUS TO THE
PRESENCE OF EACH OTHER NOW SUSPENDED HOSTILITIES FOR THE MOMENT BY
MUTUAL AND UNSPOKEN CONSENT AND VIEWED WITH RELIEF THE LITTLE
GOLDEN TINTED VALLEY AND THE TREE CLAD ROAD JUST BEYOND

THEY TOO WERE RELIEVED THOUGH MORE BY THE
MOMENTARY TRUCE THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE
THEY REGRETTED VERY MUCH TO BE
COMPELLED TO HATE EACH OTHER FOR EACH HAD RECKONED UP HIS VIS VIS
AS A RATHER PROPER SORT OF FELLOW PROBABLY A MAN OF SOME ACHIEVEMENT
USED TO GOOD LIVING AND GOOD COMPANY
EXTREME ICINESS WAS UNAVOIDABLE BETWEEN THEM HOWEVER
WHEN ONE
STRANGER HAS A SPLENDIDLY PRESERVED BLONDE WIFE AND THE OTHER A
SPLENDIDLY PRESERVED BRUNETTE WIFE BOTH OF WHOM HAVE WON SOCIAL
PROMINENCE BY YEARS OF HARD FIGHTING AND ALOOFNESS THERE REMAINS
NOTHING FOR THE TWO MEN BUT TO FOLLOW THE LEAD ESPECIALLY WHEN
DIRECTLY UNDER THE EYES OF THE LEADERS
THE SON OF THE BLONDE MATRON SMILED CHEERFULLY AS THE WELCOME LIGHT
FLOODED THE COACH
HE WAS A NICE LOOKING YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO ONE MIGHT JUDGE
AND HE DID HIS SMILING THOUGH IN A PERFECTLY IMPERSONAL AND CORRECT
SORT OF MANNER AT THE PRETTY DAUGHTER OF THE BRUNETTE MATRON
THE
PRETTY DAUGHTER ALSO SMILED BUT HER SMILE WAS DEMURELY DIRECTED AT
THE TREES OUTSIDE CLAD AS THEY WERE IN ALL THE FLAMING GLORY OF THEIR
AUTUMN TINTS GLISTENING WITH THE RECENT RAIN AND DRIPPING WITH GEMS
THAT SPARKLED AND FLASHED IN THE NOONDAY SUN AS THEY FELL
IT IS MARVELOUS HOW MUCH ONE CAN SEE OUT OF THE CORNER OF THE EYE
WHILE SEEMING TO VIEW MERE SCENERY
THE DRIVER LOOKED DOWN AS HE DROVE SAFELY OFF THE BRIDGE AND SHOOK
HIS HEAD AT THE SWIRL OF WATER THAT RUSHED AND EDDIED DARK AND MUDDY
CLOSE UP UNDER THE ROTTEN PLANKING THEN HE CRACKED HIS WHIP AND THE
HORSES STURDILY ATTACKED THE LITTLE HILL
THICK OVERHANGING TREES ON EITHER SIDE NOW DIMMED THE LIGHT AGAIN
AND THE TWO PLUMP MATRONS ONCE MORE GLARED PAST THE OPPOSITE
SHOULDERS PROFOUNDLY UNAWARE OF EACH OTHER
THE HUSBANDS TOOK ON THE
POLITELY SURLY LOOK REQUIRED OF THEM
THE BLONDE SON'S EYES STILL
SOUGHT THE BRUNETTE DAUGHTER BUT IT WAS FURTIVELY DONE AND QUITE
UNSUCCESSFULLY FOR THE DAUGHTER WAS NOW DOING A LITTLE GLARING ON HER
OWN ACCOUNT
THE BLONDE MATRON HAD JUST SWEPT HER EYES ACROSS THE
DAUGHTER'S SKIRT ESTIMATING THE FIT AND MATERIAL OF IT WITH CONTEMPT
SO ARTISTICALLY VEILED THAT IT COULD ALMOST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE DARK
II
THE BIG BAYS SWUNG TO THE BROW OF THE HILL WITH EASE AND DASHED INTO
A SMALL CIRCULAR CLEARING WHERE A QUAINT LITTLE TWO STORY BUILDING
WITH A MOSSY WATERING TROUGH OUT IN FRONT NESTLED UNDER THE SHADE OF
MAJESTIC OLD TREES THAT REARED THEIR BROWN AND SCARLET CROWNS PROUDLY
INTO THE SKY
A LONG LOW PORCH RAN ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE STRUCTURE
AND A COMPLAINING SIGN HUNG OUT ANNOUNCING IN DIM WEATHER FLECKED
LETTERS ON A CRACKED BOARD THAT THIS WAS THE TUTT HOUSE A
GRAY HEADED MAN IN BROWN OVERALLS AND FADED BLUE JUMPER STOOD ON THE
PORCH AND SHOOK HIS FIST AT THE STAGE AS IT WHIRLED BY
WHAT A DELIGHTFULLY OLD FASHIONED INN EXCLAIMED THE PRETTY
DAUGHTER
HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO STOP THERE OVER NIGHT
YOU WOULD PROBABLY WISH YOURSELF AWAY BEFORE MORNING EVELYN
REPLIED HER MOTHER INDIFFERENTLY
NO DOUBT IT WOULD BE A MERE SIEGE
OF DISCOMFORT
THE BLONDE MATRON TURNED TO HER HUSBAND
THE PRETTY DAUGHTER HAD BEEN
LOOKING AT THE PICTURESQUE INN BETWEEN THE HEADS OF THIS LADY AND
HER SON
EDWARD PLEASE PULL DOWN THE SHADE BEHIND ME SHE DIRECTED
THERE
IS QUITE A DRAUGHT FROM THAT BROKEN WINDOW
THE PRETTY DAUGHTER BIT HER LIP
THE BRUNETTE MATRON CONTINUED TO
STARE AT THE SHADE IN THE EXACT SPOT UPON WHICH HER GAZE HAD BEEN
BEFORE DIRECTED AND SHE NEVER QUIVERED AN EYELASH
THE YOUNG MAN
SEEMED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND HE TRIED TO LOOK HIS APOLOGIES TO THE
PRETTY DAUGHTER BUT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM NOW NOT EVEN IF HER EYES
HAD BEEN ALL CORNERS
THEY WERE BOWLING ALONG THROUGH ANOTHER AVENUE OF TREES WHEN THE
DRIVER SUDDENLY SHOUTED WHOA THERE
THE HORSES WERE BROUGHT UP WITH A JERK THAT WAS WELL NIGH FATAL TO THE
ASSORTMENT OF DIGNITY INSIDE THE COACH
A LOUD ROARING COULD BE HEARD
BOTH AHEAD AND IN THE REAR A SHARP SPLITTING LIKE A FUSILLADE OF
PISTOL SHOTS THEN A CREAKING AND TEARING OF TIMBERS
THE DRIVER BENT
SUDDENLY FORWARD
GID AP HE CRIED AND THE HORSES SPRANG FORWARD WITH A LURCH
HE
SWUNG THEM AROUND A SHARP BEND WITH A SKILLFUL HAND AND POISED HIS
WEIGHT ABOVE THE BRAKE AS THEY PLUNGED AT TERRIFIC SPEED DOWN A STEEP
GRADE
THE ROARING WAS LOUDER THAN EVER NOW AND IT BECAME DEAFENING
AS THEY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE THICK UNDERBRUSH AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE DECLIVITY
CAUGHT BY GRAVY EJACULATED THE DRIVER AND FOR THE SECOND TIME
HE BROUGHT THE COACH TO AN ABRUPT STOP
DO SEE WHAT IS THE MATTER RALPH SAID THE BLONDE MATRON
IMPATIENTLY
THUS COMMANDED THE YOUNG MAN SWUNG OUT AND ASKED THE DRIVER ABOUT IT
PAINTSVILLE DAM'S BUSTED HE WAS INFORMED
I BEEN A LOOKIN' FER IT
THIS MANY A YEAR AN' THIS HERE FRESHET DONE IT
YOU SEE THE HOLLER
THERE WELL THEY'S TEN FOOT O' WATER IN IT AN' IT HAD ORT TO BE
STONE DRY
THE BRIDGE IS TORE OUT BEHIND US AN' WE'RE STUCK HERE TILL
THAT WATER RUNS OUT
WE CAN'T GIT AWAY TILL TO MORRY ANYWAYS
HE POINTED OUT THE PECULIAR TOPOGRAPHY OF THE PLACE AND RALPH GOT
BACK IN THE COACH
WE'RE PRACTICALLY ON A FLOOD MADE ISLAND HE EXCLAIMED WITH ONE EYE
ON THE PRETTY DAUGHTER AND WE SHALL HAVE TO STOP OVER NIGHT AT THAT
QUAINT OLD FASHIONED INN WE PASSED A FEW MOMENTS AGO
THE PRETTY DAUGHTER'S EYES TWINKLED AND HE THOUGHT HE CAUGHT A SWIFT
DIRECT GLEAM FROM UNDER THE LONG LASHES BUT HE WAS NOT SURE
DEAR ME HOW ANNOYING SAID THE BLONDE MATRON BUT THE BRUNETTE
MATRON STILL STARED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF INTEREST IN
ANYTHING ELSE AT THE INFINITESIMAL SPOT SHE HAD SELECTED ON THE
AFFRONTING WINDOW SHADE
THE TWO MEN GAVE SIGHS OF RESIGNATION AND CAST CAREFULLY CONCEALED
GLANCES AT EACH OTHER SPECULATING ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A CIGAR AND A
GLASS AND MAYBE A GOOD STORY OR TWO OR POSSIBLY EVEN A GAME OF POKER
AFTER THE EVENING MEAL
WHO COULD TELL WHAT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAPPEN
III
WHEN THE STAGE DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE HOTEL IT FOUND UNCLE
BILLY TUTT PREPARED FOR HIS REVENGE
IN FORMER DAYS THE STAGE HAD
ALWAYS STOPPED AT THE TUTT HOUSE FOR THE NOONDAY MEAL
SINCE THE NEW
RAILWAY WAS BUILT THROUGH THE ADJOINING COUNTY HOWEVER THE STAGE
TRIP BECAME A MERE TWELVE MILE CROSS COUNTRY TRANSFER FROM ONE
RAILROAD TO ANOTHER AND THE STAGE MADE A LATER TRIP ALLOWING THE
PASSENGERS PLENTY OF TIME FOR DINNER BEFORE THEY STARTED
DAY AFTER
DAY AS THE COACH FLASHED BY WITH ITS MONEY LADEN PASSENGERS UNCLE
BILLY HAD HOPED THAT IT WOULD BREAK DOWN
BUT THIS WAS BETTER MUCH
BETTER
THE COACH MIGHT BE QUICKLY MENDED BUT NOT THE FLOOD
I'M A GOIN' T' CHARGE 'EM TILL THEY SQUEAL HE DECLARED TO THE
TIMIDLY PROTESTING AUNT MARGARET AN' THEN I'M GOIN' T' CHARGE 'EM A
LEAST MITE MORE DRAT 'EM
HE RETREATED BEHIND THE ROUGH WOODEN COUNTER THAT DID DUTY AS A DESK
SLAMMED OPEN THE FLIMSY PAPER BOUND CASH BOOK THAT SERVED AS A
REGISTER AND PLANTED HIS ELBOWS UNCOMPROMISINGLY ON EITHER SIDE OF
IT
LET 'EM BRING IN THEIR OWN TRAPS HE COMMENTED AND AUNT MARGARET
FLED ASHAMED AND CONSCIENCE SMITTEN TO THE KITCHEN
IT SEEMED AWFUL
THE FIRST ONE OUT OF THE COACH WAS THE HUSBAND OF THE BRUNETTE MATRON
AND PROCEEDING UNDER INSTRUCTIONS HE WAITED NEITHER FOR LUGGAGE NOR
WOMEN FOLK BUT HURRIED STRAIGHT INTO THE TUTT HOUSE
THE OTHER MAN
WOULD HAVE BEEN NECK AND NECK WITH HIM IN THE RACE IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
THAT HE PAUSED TO SEIZE TWO SUITCASES AND HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO DROP
ONE WHICH BURST OPEN AND SCATTERED A CHOICE ASSORTMENT OF LINGERIE
FROM ONE END OF THE DINGY COACH TO THE OTHER
IN THE CONFUSION OF RESCUING THE FLUFFERY THE OWNER OF THE SUITCASE
HAD TO SACRIFICE HER HAUTEUR AND HELP HER HUSBAND AND SON BLOCK UP THE
AISLE WHILE THE OTHER MATRON HAD THE INEFFABLE SATISFACTION OF BEING
KEPT WAITING AT LAST BEING ENABLED TO SAY SWEETLY AND WITH THE
MOST POLITE CONSIDERATION
WILL YOU KINDLY ALLOW ME TO PASS
THE BLONDE MATRON RAISED UP AND SWEPT HER SKIRTS BACK PERFECTLY FLAT
SHE WAS PALE BUT COLLECTED
HER HUSBAND WAS PINK BUT COLLECTED
HER
SON WAS CRIMSON AND UNCOLLECTED
THE BRUNETTE DAUGHTER COULD NOT HAVE
FOUND AN EYE ANYWHERE IN HIS COUNTENANCE AS SHE RUSTLED OUT AFTER HER
MOTHER
I DO HOPE THAT BELMONT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SECURE CHOICE QUARTERS THE
TRIUMPHING MATRON REMARKED AS HER DAUGHTER JOINED HER ON THE GROUND
THIS PLACE LOOKED SO VERY SMALL THAT THERE CAN SCARCELY BE MORE THAN
ONE COMFORTABLE SUITE IN IT
IT WAS A VITAL THRUST
ONLY A SPLENDIDLY CULTIVATED SELF CONTROL
PREVENTED THE BLONDE MATRON FROM RETALIATING UPON THE UNFORTUNATE WHO
HAD MUDDLED THINGS
EVEN SO HER EYES SPOKE WHOLE SHELVES OF VOLUMES
THE MAN WHO FIRST REACHED THE REGISTER WROTE IN A STRAIGHT BLACK
SCRAWL J
BELMONT VAN KAMP WIFE AND DAUGHTER THERE BEING NO
SPACE LEFT FOR HIS ADDRESS HE PUT NONE DOWN
I WANT THREE ADJOINING ROOMS EN SUITE IF POSSIBLE HE DEMANDED
THREE EXCLAIMED UNCLE BILLY SCRATCHING HIS HEAD
WON'T TWO DO YE
I AIN'T GOT BUT SIX BEDROOMS IN TH' HOUSE
ME AN' MARG'T SLEEPS IN
ONE AN' WE'RE A GITTIN' TOO OLD FER A SHAKE DOWN ON TH' FLOOR
I'LL
HAVE T' SAVE ONE ROOM FER TH' DRIVER AN' THAT LEAVES FOUR
YOU TAKE
TWO NOW
MR
VAN KAMP CAST A HASTY GLANCE OUT OF THE WINDOW THE OTHER MAN WAS
GETTING OUT OF THE COACH
HIS OWN WIFE WAS STEPPING ON THE PORCH
WHAT DO YOU ASK FOR MEALS AND LODGING UNTIL THIS TIME TO MORROW HE
INTERRUPTED
THE DECISIVE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED
UNCLE BILLY DREW A DEEP BREATH
TWO DOLLARS A HEAD HE DEFIANTLY ANNOUNCED
THERE IT WAS OUT HE
WISHED MARGARET HAD STAYED TO HEAR HIM SAY IT
THE GUEST DID NOT SEEM TO BE SERIOUSLY SHOCKED AND UNCLE BILLY WAS
BEGINNING TO BE SORRY HE HAD NOT SAID THREE DOLLARS WHEN MR
VAN KAMP
STOPPED THE LANDLORD'S OWN BREATH
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR THE THREE BEST ROOMS IN THE HOUSE
HE CALMLY SAID AND LANDLORD TUTT GASPED AS THE MONEY FLUTTERED DOWN
UNDER HIS NOSE
JIS' TAKE YORE FOLKS RIGHT ON UP MR
KAMP SAID UNCLE BILLY
POUNCING ON THE MONEY
TH' ROOMS IS TH' THREE RIGHT ALONG TH' HULL
FRONT O' TH' HOUSE
I'LL BE UP AND MAKE ON A FIRE IN A MINUTE
JIS'
TAKE TH' JONESVILLE BANNER AN' TH' UTICKY CLARION ALONG WITH YE
AS THE SWISH OF SKIRTS MARKED THE PASSAGE OF THE VAN KAMPS UP THE WIDE
HALL STAIRWAY THE OTHER PARTY SWEPT INTO THE ROOM
THE MAN WROTE IN A ROUND FLOURISH EDWARD EASTMAN ELLSWORTH WIFE
AND SON
I'D LIKE THREE CHOICE ROOMS EN SUITE HE SAID
GOSH SAID UNCLE BILLY REGRETFULLY
THAT'S WHAT MR
KAMP WANTED
FUST OFF AN' HE GOT IT
THEY HAIN'T BUT TH' LITTLE ROOM OVER TH'
KITCHEN LEFT
I'LL HAVE TO PUT YOU AN' YOUR WIFE IN THAT AN' LET YOUR
BOY SLEEP WITH TH' DRIVER
THE CONSTERNATION IN THE ELLSWORTH PARTY WAS PAST CALCULATING BY ANY
KNOWN STANDARDS OF MEASUREMENT
THE THING WAS AN OUTRAGE IT WAS NOT
TO BE BORNE THEY WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO IT
UNCLE BILLY HOWEVER SECURE IN HIS MASTERY OF THE SITUATION CALMLY
QUARTERED THEM AS HE HAD SAID
AN' LET 'EM SPLUTTER ALL THEY WANT
TO HE COMMENTED COMFORTABLY TO HIMSELF
IV
THE ELLSWORTHS WERE HOLDING A FAMILY INDIGNATION MEETING ON THE BROAD
PORCH WHEN THE VAN RAMPS CAME CONTENTEDLY DOWN FOR A WALK AND BRUSHED
BY THEM WITH UNSEEING EYES
IT MAKES A PERFECTLY FASCINATING SUITE OBSERVED MRS
VAN KAMP IN A
PLEASANTLY CONVERSATIONAL TONE THAT COULD BE EASILY OVERHEARD BY
ANYONE IMPOLITE ENOUGH TO LISTEN
THAT DELIGHTFUL OLD FASHIONED
FIREPLACE IN THE MIDDLE APARTMENT MAKES IT AN IDEAL SITTING ROOM AND
THE BEDS ARE SO ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE
I JUST KNEW IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS CHIRRUPED MISS EVELYN
I
REMARKED AS WE PASSED THE PLACE IF YOU WILL REMEMBER HOW CHARMING IT
WOULD BE TO STOP IN THIS DEAR QUAINT OLD INN OVER NIGHT
ALL MY
WISHES SEEM TO COME TRUE THIS YEAR
THESE SIMPLE AND OF COURSE ENTIRELY UNPREMEDITATED REMARKS WERE AS
VINEGAR AND WORMWOOD TO MRS
ELLSWORTH AND SHE GAZED AFTER THE
RETREATING VAN KAMPS WITH A GLINT IN HER EYE THAT WOULD MAKE ONE
UNDERSTAND LUCRETIA BORGIA AT LAST
HER SON ALSO GAZED AFTER THE RETREATING VAN KAMP
SHE HAD AN EXQUISITE
FIGURE AND SHE CARRIED HERSELF WITH A MOST DELECTABLE GRACE
AS THE
PARTY DREW AWAY FROM THE INN SHE DROPPED BEHIND THE ELDERS AND
WANDERED OFF INTO A SIDE PATH TO GATHER AUTUMN LEAVES
RALPH TOO STARTED OFF FOR A WALK BUT NATURALLY NOT IN THE SAME
DIRECTION
EDWARD SUDDENLY SAID MRS
ELLSWORTH
I WANT YOU TO TURN THOSE
PEOPLE OUT OF THAT SUITE BEFORE NIGHT
VERY WELL HE REPLIED WITH A SIGH AND GOT UP TO DO IT
HE HAD
WRECKED A RAILROAD AND MADE ONE AND HAD OPERATED SUCCESSFUL CORNERS
IN NUTMEGS AND CHICORY
NO TASK SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE
HE WALKED IN TO SEE
THE LANDLORD
WHAT ARE THE VAN KAMPS PAYING YOU FOR THOSE THREE ROOMS HE ASKED
FIFTEEN DOLLARS UNCLE BILLY INFORMED HIM SMOKING ONE OF MR
VAN
KAMP'S GOOD CIGARS AND TWIDDLING HIS THUMBS IN HUGE CONTENT
I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY FOR THEM
JUST SET THEIR BAGGAGE OUTSIDE AND
TELL THEM THE ROOMS ARE OCCUPIED
NO SIR REE REJOINED UNCLE BILLY
A BARGAIN'S A BARGAIN AN' I
ALLUS STICK TO ONE I MAKE
MR
ELLSWORTH WITHDREW BUT NOT DEFEATED
HE HAD NEVER SUPPOSED THAT
SUCH AN ABSURD PROPOSITION WOULD BE ACCEPTED
IT WAS ONLY A FEELER
AND HE HAD NOTICED A WINCE OF REGRET IN HIS LANDLORD
HE SAT DOWN ON
THE PORCH AND LIT A STRONG CIGAR
HIS WIFE DID NOT BOTHER HIM
SHE
GAZED COMPLACENTLY AT THE FLAMING FOLIAGE OPPOSITE AND ALLOWED HIM TO
THINK
GETTING IMPOSSIBLE THINGS WAS HIS BUSINESS IN LIFE AND SHE HAD
CONFIDENCE IN HIM
I WANT TO RENT YOUR ENTIRE HOUSE FOR A WEEK HE ANNOUNCED TO UNCLE
BILLY A FEW MINUTES LATER
IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE FLOOD MIGHT
LAST LONGER THAN THEY ANTICIPATED
UNCLE BILLY'S EYES TWINKLED
I RECKON IT KIN BE DID HE ALLOWED
I RECKON A HO TEL MAN'S GOT A
RIGHT TO RENT HIS HULL HOUSE ARY MINUTE
OF COURSE HE HAS
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
UNCLE BILLY HAD MADE ONE MISTAKE IN NOT ASKING THIS SORT OF FOLKS
ENOUGH AND HE REFLECTED IN PERPLEXITY
MAKE ME A OFFER HE PROPOSED
EF IT HAIN'T ENOUGH I'LL TELL YE
YOU
WANT TO RENT TH' HULL PLACE BACK LOT AN' ALL
NO JUST THE MERE HOUSE
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH ANSWERED THE OTHER
WITH A SMILE
HE WAS ON THE POINT OF OFFERING A HUNDRED DOLLARS WHEN
HE SAW THE LITTLE WRINKLES ABOUT MR
TUTT'S EYES AND HE SAID
SEVENTY FIVE
SHO YE'RE JOKIN' RETORTED UNCLE BILLY
HE HAD BEEN CONSIDERED A
FINE HORSE TRADER IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
MAKE IT A HUNDRED AND
TWENTY FIVE AN' I'LL GO YE
MR
ELLSWORTH COUNTED OUT SOME BILLS
HERE'S A HUNDRED HE SAID
THAT OUGHT TO BE ABOUT RIGHT
FIFTEEN MORE INSISTED UNCLE BILLY
WITH A LITTLE FROWN OF IMPATIENCE THE OTHER COUNTED OFF THE EXTRA
MONEY AND HANDED IT OVER
UNCLE BILLY GRAVELY HANDED IT BACK
THEM'S THE FIFTEEN DOLLARS MR
KAMP GIVE ME HE EXPLAINED
YOU'VE
GOT THE HULL HOUSE FER A WEEK AN' O' COURSE ALL TH' MONEY THAT'S
TOOKEN IN IS YOUR'N
YOU KIN DO AS YE PLEASE ABOUT RENTIN' OUT ROOMS
TO OTHER FOLKS I RECKON
A BARGAIN'S A BARGAIN AN' I ALLUS STICK TO
ONE I MAKE
V
RALPH ELLSWORTH STALKED AMONG THE TREES FEVERISHLY SEARCHING FOR
SQUIRRELS SCARLET LEAVES AND THE GLINT OF A BROWN WALKING DRESS
THIS LAST NOT BEING SO EASY TO LOCATE IN SUNLIT AUTUMN WOODS
TIME
AFTER TIME HE QUICKENED HIS PACE ONLY TO FIND THAT HE HAD BEEN FOOLED
BY A PATCH OF DOGWOOD A CLUMP OF HAW BUSHES OR EVEN A LEAF STREWN
KNOLL BUT AT LAST HE UNMISTAKABLY SAW THE DRESS AND THEN HE SLOWED
DOWN TO A CARELESS SAUNTER
SHE WAS REACHING UP FOR SOME BRILLIANTLY COLORED MAPLE LEAVES AND WAS
ENTIRELY UNCONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE ESPECIALLY AFTER SHE HAD SEEN
HIM
HER POSE SHOWED HER PRETTY FIGURE TO ADVANTAGE BUT OF COURSE
SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT
HOW SHOULD SHE
RALPH ADMIRED THE PICTURE VERY MUCH
THE HAT THE HAIR THE GOWN THE
DAINTY SHOES EVEN THE NARROW STRIP OF SILKEN HOSE THAT WAS REVEALED
AS SHE STOOD A UPTOE WERE ALL OF A DEEP RICH BROWN THAT PROVED AN
EXQUISITE FOIL FOR THE PINK AND CREAM OF HER CHEEKS
HE REMEMBERED
THAT HER EYES WERE ALMOST THE SAME SHADE AND WONDERED HOW IT WAS THAT
WOMEN FOLK HAPPENED ON COMBINATIONS IN DRESS THAT SO WELL SET OFF
THEIR NATURAL CHARMS
THE FOOL
HE WAS ABOUT THREE TREES AWAY NOW AND A PANIC AKIN TO THAT WHICH
HUNTERS DESCRIBE AS BUCK AGUE SEIZED HIM
HE DECIDED THAT HE REALLY
HAD NO EXCUSE FOR COMING ANY NEARER
IT WOULD NOT DO EITHER TO BE
SEEN STARING AT HER IF SHE SHOULD HAPPEN TO TURN HER HEAD SO HE
VEERED OFF INTENDING TO REGAIN THE ROAD
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO
THIS WITHOUT PASSING DIRECTLY IN HER RANGE OF VISION AND HE DID NOT
INTEND TO TRY TO AVOID IT
HE HAD A FINE MANLY FIGURE OF HIS OWN
HE HAD JUST PASSED THE NEAREST RADIUS TO HER CIRCLE AND WAS PROCEEDING
ALONG THE TANGENT THAT HE HAD LAID OUT FOR HIMSELF WHEN THE UNWITTING
MAID LOOKED CAREFULLY DOWN AND SAW A TANGLE OF ROOTS AT HER VERY FEET
SHE WAS SO UNFORTUNATE A SECOND LATER AS TO SLIP HER FOOT IN THIS
VERY TANGLE AND GIVE HER ANKLE EVER SO SLIGHT A TWIST
OH CRIED MISS VAN KAMP AND RALPH ELLSWORTH FLEW TO THE RESCUE
HE
HAD NOT BEEN NOTICING HER AT ALL AND YET HE HAD STARTED TO HER SIDE
BEFORE SHE HAD EVEN CRIED OUT WHICH WAS STRANGE
SHE HAD A VERY
ATTRACTIVE VOICE
MAY I BE OF ASSISTANCE HE ANXIOUSLY INQUIRED
I THINK NOT THANK YOU SHE REPLIED COMPRESSING HER LIPS TO KEEP
BACK THE INTOLERABLE PAIN AND HALF CLOSING HER EYES TO SHOW THE FINE
LASHES
DECLINING THE PROFFERED HELP SHE EXTRICATED HER FOOT PICKED
UP HER AUTUMN BRANCHES AND TURNED AWAY
SHE WAS INTENSELY AVERSE TO
ANYTHING THAT COULD BE CONSTRUED AS A FLIRTATION EVEN OF THE MILDEST
HE COULD CERTAINLY SEE THAT
SHE TOOK A STEP SWAYED SLIGHTLY DROPPED
THE LEAVES AND CLUTCHED OUT HER HAND TO HIM
IT IS NOTHING SHE ASSURED HIM IN A MOMENT WITHDRAWING THE HAND
AFTER HE HAD HELD IT QUITE LONG ENOUGH
NOTHING WHATEVER
I GAVE MY
FOOT A SLIGHT WRENCH AND TURNED THE LEAST BIT FAINT FOR A MOMENT
YOU MUST PERMIT ME TO WALK BACK AT LEAST TO THE ROAD WITH YOU HE
INSISTED GATHERING UP HER ARMLOAD OF BRANCHES
I COULDN'T THINK OF
LEAVING YOU HERE ALONE
AS HE STOOPED TO RAISE THE GAY WOODLAND TREASURES HE SMILED TO
HIMSELF EVER SO SLIGHTLY
THIS WAS NOT HIS FIRST SEASON OUT
EITHER
DELIGHTFUL SPOT ISN'T IT HE OBSERVED AS THEY REGAINED THE ROAD AND
SAUNTERED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TUTT HOUSE
QUITE SO SHE RESERVEDLY ANSWERED
SHE HAD NOTICED THAT SMILE AS HE
STOOPED
HE MUST BE SNUBBED A LITTLE
IT WOULD BE SO GOOD FOR HIM
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW BILLY EVANS OF BOSTON DO YOU HE ASKED
I THINK NOT
I AM BUT VERY LITTLE ACQUAINTED IN BOSTON
TOO BAD HE WENT ON
I WAS RATHER IN HOPES YOU KNEW BILLY
ALL
SORTS OF A SPLENDID FELLOW AND KNOWS EVERYBODY
NOT QUITE IT SEEMS SHE REMINDED HIM AND HE WINCED AT THE ERROR
IN SPITE OF THE SLY SMILE THAT HE HAD PERMITTED TO HIMSELF HE WAS
UNUSUALLY INTERESTED
HE TRIED THE WEATHER THE FLOOD THE ACCIDENT GOLF BOOKS AND THREE
GOOD SUBSTANTIAL WARRANTED JOKES BUT THE CONVERSATION LAGGED IN
SPITE OF HIM
MISS VAN KAMP WOULD NOT FOR THE WORLD HAVE IT UNDERSTOOD
THAT THIS UNCONVENTIONAL MEETING MADE ALLOWABLE BY HER WRENCHED
ANKLE COULD POSSIBLY FULFILL THE FUNCTIONS OF A FORMAL INTRODUCTION
WHAT A RIPPING QUEER OLD BUILDING THAT IS HE EXCLAIMED MAKING ONE
MORE BRAVE EFFORT AS THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOTEL
IT IS RATHER SHE ASSENTED
THE ROOMS IN IT ARE AS QUAINT AND
DELIGHTFUL AS THE EXTERIOR TOO
SHE LOOKED AS HARMLESS AND INNOCENT AS A BASKET OF PEACHES AS SHE SAID
IT AND NEVER THE SUSPICION OF A SMILE DEEPENED THE DIMPLE IN THE
CHEEK TOWARD HIM
THE SMILE WAS GLOWING CHEERFULLY AWAY INSIDE
THOUGH
HE COULD FEEL IT IF HE COULD NOT SEE IT AND HE LAUGHED
ALOUD
YOUR CROWD RATHER GOT THE BETTER OF US THERE HE ADMITTED WITH THE
KEEN APPRECIATION OF ONE STILL QUITE CLOSE TO COLLEGE DAYS
OF COURSE THE MATER IS FURIOUS BUT I RATHER LOOK ON IT AS A LARK
SHE THAWED LIKE AN APRIL ICICLE
IT'S PERFECTLY JOLLY SHE LAUGHED WITH HIM
AWFULLY SELFISH OF US
TOO I KNOW BUT SUCH LOADS OF FUN
THEY WERE CLOSE TO THE TUTT HOUSE NOW AND HER LIMP THAT HAD ENTIRELY
DISAPPEARED AS THEY EMERGED FROM THE WOODS NOW BECAME QUITE
PERCEPTIBLE
THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOWS THOUGH
IT IS HARD TO SEE WHY THAT SHOULD AFFECT A LIMP
RALPH WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT A THAW HAD SET IN AND HE MADE ONE
MORE ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH AT LEAST A PROXY ACQUAINTANCE
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW PEYSON KINGSLEY OF PHILADELPHIA DO YOU
I'M AFRAID I DON'T SHE REPLIED
I KNOW SO FEW PHILADELPHIA PEOPLE
YOU SEE SHE WAS RATHER REGRETFUL ABOUT IT THIS TIME
HE REALLY WAS A
CLEVER SORT OF A FELLOW IN SPITE OF THAT SMILE
THE CENTER WINDOW IN THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE TUTT HOUSE SWUNG OPEN
ITS LITTLE SQUARES OF GLASS FLASHING JUBILANTLY IN THE SUNLIGHT
MRS
ELLSWORTH LEANED OUT OVER THE SILL FROM THE QUAINT OLD SITTING ROOM
OF THE VAN KAMP APARTMENTS
OH RALPH SHE CALLED IN HER MOST DULCET TONES
KINDLY EXCUSE
YOURSELF AND COME RIGHT ON UP TO OUR SUITE FOR A FEW MOMENTS
VI
IT IS NOT NEARLY SO EASY TO TAKE A PRACTICAL JOKE AS TO PERPETRATE
ONE
EVELYN WAS SITTING THOUGHTFULLY ON THE PORCH WHEN HER FATHER AND
MOTHER RETURNED
MRS
ELLSWORTH WAS SITTING AT THE CENTER WINDOW
ABOVE PLACIDLY LOOKING OUT
HER EYES SWEPT CARELESSLY OVER THE VAN
KAMPS AND UNCONCERNEDLY PASSED ON TO THE REST OF THE LANDSCAPE
MRS
VAN KAMP GASPED AND CLUTCHED THE ARM OF HER HUSBAND
THERE WAS NO
NEED
HE TOO HAD SEEN THE APPARITION
EVELYN NOW FOR THE FIRST
TIME SAW THE REAL HUMOR OF THE SITUATION
SHE SMILED AS SHE THOUGHT
OF RALPH
SHE OWED HIM ONE BUT SHE NEVER WORRIED ABOUT HER DEBTS
SHE
ALWAYS MANAGED TO GET THEM PAID PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST
MR
VAN KAMP SUDDENLY GLOWERED AND STRODE INTO THE TUTT HOUSE
UNCLE
BILLY MET HIM AT THE DOOR REFLECTIVELY CHEWING A STRAW AND HANDED
HIM AN ENVELOPE
MR
VAN KAMP TORE IT OPEN AND DREW OUT A NOTE
THREE
FIVE DOLLAR BILLS CAME OUT WITH IT AND FLUTTERED TO THE PORCH FLOOR
THIS MISSIVE CONFRONTED HIM
MR
J
BELMONT VAN KAMP
DEAR SIR THIS IS TO NOTIFY YOU THAT I HAVE RENTED THE ENTIRE TUTT
HOUSE FOR THE ENSUING WEEK AND AM COMPELLED TO ASSUME POSSESSION OF
THE THREE SECOND FLOOR FRONT ROOMS

EDWARD EASTMAN ELLSWORTH
MR
VAN KAMP PASSED THE NOTE TO HIS WIFE AND SAT DOWN OR A LARGE
CHAIR
HE WAS GLAD THAT THE CHAIR WAS COMFORTABLE AND ROOMY
EVELYN
PICKED UP THE BILLS AND TUCKED THEM INTO HER WAIST
SHE NEVER
OVERLOOKED ANY OF HER PERQUISITES
MRS
VAN KAMP READ THE NOTE AND
THE TIP OF HER NOSE BECAME WHITE
SHE ALSO SAT DOWN BUT SHE WAS THE
FIRST TO FIND HER VOICE
ATROCIOUS SHE EXCLAIMED
ATROCIOUS SIMPLY ATROCIOUS BELMONT
THIS IS A HOUSE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT
THEY CAN'T TURN US OUT IN
THIS HIGH MINDED MANNER ISN'T THERE A LAW OR SOMETHING TO THAT
EFFECT
IT WOULDN'T MATTER IF THERE WAS HE THOUGHTFULLY REPLIED
THIS
FELLOW ELLSWORTH WOULD BE TOO CLEVER TO BE CAUGHT BY IT
HE WOULD SAY
THAT THE HOUSE WAS NOT A HOTEL BUT A PRIVATE RESIDENCE DURING THE
PERIOD FOR WHICH HE HAS RENTED IT
PERSONALLY HE RATHER ADMIRED ELLSWORTH
SEEMED TO BE A RESOURCEFUL
SORT OF CHAP WHO KNEW HOW TO MAKE MONEY BEHAVE ITSELF AND DO ITS
LITTLE TRICKS WITHOUT BALKING IN THE HARNESS
THEN YOU CAN MAKE HIM TAKE DOWN THE SIGN HIS WIFE DECLARED
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DECIDEDLY
IT WOULDN'T DO BELLE HE REPLIED
IT WOULD BE SPITE NOT
RETALIATION AND NOT AT ALL SPORTSMANLIKE
THE COURSE YOU SUGGEST
WOULD BELITTLE US MORE THAN IT WOULD ANNOY THEM
THERE MUST BE SOME
OTHER WAY
HE WENT IN TO TALK WITH UNCLE BILLY
I WANT TO BUY THIS PLACE HE STATED

MR
VAN KAMP RETIRED IN DISORDER BUT THE THOUGHT OF HIS WIFE AND
DAUGHTER WAITING CONFIDENTLY ON THE PORCH STOPPED HIM
MOREOVER THE
THING HAD RESOLVED ITSELF RATHER INTO A CONTEST BETWEEN ELLSWORTH AND
HIMSELF AND HE HAD DONE A LITTLE MAKING AND BREAKING OF MEN AND
THINGS IN HIS OWN TIME

NEWEL POST AND PRESENTLY REJOINED UNCLE BILLY
MR
TUTT TELL ME JUST EXACTLY WHAT MR

MR
VAN KAMP TOOK A WAD OF LOOSE BILLS FROM HIS TROUSERS POCKET
STRAIGHTENED THEM OUT LEISURELY AND PLACED THEM IN HIS BILL BOOK
ALONG WITH SOME SMOOTH YELLOWBACKS OF EYE BULGING DENOMINATIONS
UNCLE
BILLY SAT UP AND STOPPED TWIDDLING HIS THUMBS
NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT THE FURNITURE WAS THERE SUAVELY INQUIRED
VAN KAMP
UNCLE BILLY LEANED BLANKLY BACK IN HIS CHAIR
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE
LIGHT DAWNED ON THE EX HORSE TRADER
THE CROW'S FEET REAPPEARED ABOUT
HIS EYES HIS MOUTH TWITCHED HE SMILED HE GRINNED THEN HE SLAPPED
HIS THIGH AND HAW HAWED

VII
UNCLE BILLY CAME BACK FROM THE TUTT HOUSE ANNEX AS MR
VAN KAMP
DUBBED THE BARN WITH ENOUGH MORE MONEY TO MAKE HIM LOVE ALL THE WORLD
UNTIL HE GOT USED TO HAVING IT
UNCLE BILLY BELONGS TO A LARGE FAMILY
MR
VAN KAMP JOINED THE WOMEN ON THE PORCH AND EXPLAINED THE
ATTRACTIVELY NOVEL SITUATION TO THEM
THEY WERE CHATTING GAILY WHEN

YES SIR REE UNCLE BILLY ASSURED HIM
THEY SHAN'T NOBODY TAKE THEM
ROOMS AWAY FROM YOU FER MONEY MARBLES NER CHALK
A BARGAIN'S A
BARGAIN AN' I ALLUS STICK TO ONE I MAKE AND HE VIRTUOUSLY TOOK A
CHEW OF TOBACCO WHILE HE INSPECTED THE AFTERNOON SKY WITH A CLEAR
CONSCIENCE
I WANT TO GET SOME OF THOSE SPLENDID AUTUMN LEAVES TO DECORATE OUR
COZY APARTMENTS MRS
ELLSWORTH TOLD HER HUSBAND AS THEY PASSED IN
HEARING OF THE VAN KAMPS
DO YOU KNOW THOSE OLDTIME RAG RUGS ARE THE
MOST ODDLY DECORATIVE EFFECTS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN
THEY ARE SO RICH
IN COLOR AND SO EXQUISITELY BLENDED
THERE WERE REASONS WHY THIS POISONED ARROW FAILED TO RANKLE BUT THE
VAN KAMPS DID NOT TROUBLE TO EXPLAIN
THEY WERE WAITING FOR RALPH TO
COME OUT AND JOIN HIS PARENTS
RALPH IT SEEMED HOWEVER HAD DECIDED
NOT TO TAKE A WALK
HE HAD ALREADY FATIGUED HIMSELF HE HAD EXPLAINED
AND HIS MOTHER HAD FAVORED HIM WITH A SIGNIFICANT LOOK
SHE COULD
READILY BELIEVE HIM SHE HAD ASSURED HIM AND HAD THEN LEFT HIM IN
SCORN
THE VAN KAMPS WENT OUT TO CONSIDER THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BARN
EVELYN
RETURNED FIRST AND CAME OUT ON THE PORCH TO FIND A HANDKERCHIEF
IT
WAS NOT THERE BUT RALPH WAS
SHE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED TO SEE HIM
AND SHE INTIMATED AS MUCH
IT'S DREADFULLY DAMP IN THE WOODS HE EXPLAINED
BY THE WAY YOU
DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THE WHITLEYS OF WASHINGTON DO YOU MOST
EXCELLENT PEOPLE
I'M QUITE SORRY THAT I DO NOT SHE REPLIED
BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO
EXCUSE ME
WE SHALL BE KEPT VERY BUSY WITH ARRANGING OUR APARTMENTS
RALPH SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A LUDICROUS EXPRESSION
NOT THE SECOND FLOOR FRONT SUITE HE EXCLAIMED
OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REASSURED HIM
HE LAUGHED LIGHTLY
HONORS ARE ABOUT EVEN IN THAT GAME HE SAID
EVELYN CALLED HER MOTHER FROM THE HALL
PLEASE COME AND TAKE THOSE
FRONT SUITE CURTAINS DOWN TO THE BARN
PARDON ME WHILE WE TAKE THE NEXT TRICK REMARKED EVELYN WITH A LAUGH
QUITE AS LIGHT AND GLEEFUL AS HIS OWN AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE HALL
HE FOLLOWED HER SLOWLY AND WAS MET AT THE DOOR BY HER FATHER
YOU ARE THE YOUNGER MR
ELLSWORTH I BELIEVE POLITELY SAID MR
VAN
KAMP
RALPH ELLSWORTH
YES SIR
HERE IS A NOTE FOR YOUR FATHER
IT IS UNSEALED
YOU ARE QUITE AT
LIBERTY TO READ IT
MR
VAN KAMP BOWED HIMSELF AWAY AND RALPH OPENED THE NOTE WHICH
READ
EDWARD EASTMAN ELLSWORTH ESQ
DEAR SIR THIS IS TO NOTIFY YOU THAT I HAVE RENTED THE ENTIRE
FURNITURE OF THE TUTT HOUSE FOR THE ENSUING WEEK AND AM COMPELLED TO
ASSUME POSSESSION OF THAT IN THE THREE SECOND FLOOR FRONT ROOMS AS
WELL AS ALL THE BALANCE NOT IN ACTUAL USE BY MR

TUTT AND THE
DRIVER OF THE STAGE
YOU ARE QUITE WELCOME HOWEVER TO MAKE USE OF
THE FURNISHINGS IN THE SMALL ROOM OVER THE KITCHEN
YOUR LUGGAGE YOU
WILL FIND UNDISTURBED
REGRETTING ANY INCONVENIENCE THAT THIS
TRANSACTION MAY CAUSE YOU I REMAIN
YOURS RESPECTFULLY
J
BELMONT VAN KAMP
RALPH SCRATCHED HIS HEAD IN AMUSED PERPLEXITY
IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM TO
EVEN UP THE AFFAIR A LITTLE BEFORE HIS MOTHER CAME BACK
HE MUST
SUPPORT THE FAMILY REPUTATION FOR RESOURCEFULNESS BUT IT TOOK QUITE A
BIT OF SCALP IRRITATION BEFORE HE AGGRAVATED THE RIGHT IDEA INTO
BEING
AS SOON AS THE IDEA CAME HE WENT IN AND MADE A HIDE BOUND
BARGAIN WITH UNCLE BILLY THEN HE WENT OUT INTO THE HALL AND WAITED
UNTIL EVELYN CAME DOWN WITH A HUGE ARMLOAD OF WINDOW CURTAINS
HONORS ARE STILL EVEN HE REMARKED
I HAVE JUST BOUGHT ALL THE
EDIBLES ABOUT THE PLACE WHETHER IN THE CELLAR THE HOUSE OR ANY OF
THE SURROUNDING STRUCTURES IN THE GROUND ABOVE THE GROUND DEAD OR
ALIVE AND A BARGAIN'S A BARGAIN AS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
CLEVER OF YOU I'M SURE COMMENTED MISS VAN KAMP REFLECTIVELY
SUDDENLY HER LIPS PARTED WITH A SMILE THAT REVEALED A DOUBLE ROW OF
MOST BEAUTIFUL TEETH
HE MEDITATIVELY WATCHED THE CURVE OF HER LIPS
ISN'T THAT RATHER A HEAVY LOAD HE SUGGESTED
I'D BE DELIGHTED TO
HELP YOU MOVE THE THINGS DON'T YOU KNOW
IT IS QUITE KIND OF YOU AND WHAT THE MEN WOULD CALL 'GAME I
BELIEVE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE ANSWERED BUT REALLY IT WILL
NOT BE NECESSARY
WE HAVE HIRED MR
TUTT AND THE DRIVER TO DO THE
HEAVIER PART OF THE WORK AND THE REST OF IT WILL BE REALLY A PLEASANT
DIVERSION
NO DOUBT AGREED RALPH WITH AN APPRECIATIVE GRIN
BY THE WAY YOU
DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW MAUD AND DOROTHY PARTRIDGE OF BALTIMORE DO YOU
STUNNING PRETTY GIRLS BOTH OF THEM AND NO END OF SWELLS
I KNOW SO VERY FEW PEOPLE IN BALTIMORE SHE MURMURED AND TRIPPED ON
DOWN TO THE BARN
RALPH WENT OUT ON THE PORCH AND SMOKED
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT HE
COULD DO
VIII
IT WAS GROWING DUSK WHEN THE ELDER ELLSWORTHS RETURNED ALMOST HIDDEN
BY GREAT MASSES OF AUTUMN BOUGHS
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN WITH US RALPH ENTHUSIASTICALLY SAID HIS
MOTHER
I NEVER SAW SUCH GORGEOUS TINTS IN ALL MY LIFE
WE HAVE
BROUGHT NEARLY THE ENTIRE WOODS WITH US
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SAID RALPH
A STUNNING GOOD IDEA
THEY MAY COME
IN HANDY TO SLEEP ON
MRS
ELLSWORTH TURNED COLD
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE GASPED
RALPH STERNLY DEMANDED HIS FATHER YOU DON'T MEAN TO TELL US THAT
YOU LET THE VAN KAMPS JOCKEY US OUT OF THOSE ROOMS AFTER ALL
INDEED NO HE AIRILY RESPONDED
JUST COME RIGHT ON UP AND SEE
HE LED THE WAY INTO THE SUITE AND STRUCK A MATCH
ONE SOLITARY CANDLE
HAD BEEN LEFT UPON THE MANTEL SHELF
RALPH THOUGHT THAT THIS HAD BEEN
OVERLOOKED BUT HIS MOTHER AFTERWARDS SET HIM RIGHT ABOUT THAT
MRS
VAN KAMP HAD CLEVERLY LEFT IT SO THAT THE ELLSWORTHS COULD SEE HOW
DREADFULLY BARE THE PLACE WAS
ONE CANDLE IN THREE ROOMS IS DREARIER
THAN DARKNESS ANYHOW
MRS
ELLSWORTH TOOK IN ALL THE DESOLATION THE DISMAL EXPANSE OF THE
NOW ENORMOUS APARTMENTS THE SHABBY WALLS THE HIDEOUS BRIGHT SPOTS
WHERE PICTURES HAD HUNG THE SPLINTERED FLOORING THE GREAT GAUNT
WINDOWS AND SHE GAVE IN
SHE HAD MET WITH SNUB AFTER SNUB AND CUT
AFTER CUT IN HER SOCIAL CLIMB SHE HAD HAD THE COOK QUIT IN THE
MIDDLE OF AN IMPORTANT DINNER SHE HAD HAD EVERY DISCONCERTING THING
POSSIBLE HAPPEN TO HER BUT THIS THIS WAS THE LAST BALE OF STRAW
SHE SAT DOWN ON A SUITCASE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST ROOM AND
CRIED
RALPH HAVING WAITED FOR THIS NOW TOLD ABOUT THE FOOD TRANSACTION
AND SHE HASTILY PUSHED THE LAST COMING TEAR BACK INTO HER EYE
GOOD SHE CRIED
THEY WILL BE UP HERE SOON
THEY WILL BE COMPELLED
TO COMPROMISE AND THEY MUST NOT FIND ME WITH RED EYES
SHE CAST A HASTY GLANCE AROUND THE ROOM THEN IN A SUDDEN PANIC
SEIZED THE CANDLE AND EXPLORED THE OTHER TWO
SHE WENT WILDLY OUT INTO
THE HALL BACK INTO THE LITTLE ROOM OVER THE KITCHEN DOWNSTAIRS
EVERYWHERE AND RETURNED IN CONSTERNATION
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE MIRROR LEFT IN THE HOUSE SHE MOANED
RALPH HEARTLESSLY GRINNED
HE COULD APPRECIATE THAT THIS WAS A
CHARACTERISTIC WOMAN TRICK AND WONDERED ADMIRINGLY WHETHER EVELYN OR
HER MOTHER HAD THOUGHT OF IT
HOWEVER THIS WAS A TIME FOR ACTION
I'LL GET YOU SOME WATER TO BATHE YOUR EYES HE OFFERED AND RAN INTO
THE LITTLE ROOM OVER THE KITCHEN TO GET A PITCHER
A CRACKED
SHAVING MUG WAS THE ONLY VESSEL THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BUT HE HURRIED
DOWN INTO THE YARD WITH IT
THIS WAS NO TIME FOR FASTIDIOUSNESS
HE HAD BARELY CREAKED THE PUMP HANDLE WHEN MR
VAN KAMP HURRIED UP
FROM THE BARN
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID MR
VAN KAMP BUT THIS WATER BELONGS
TO US
MY DAUGHTER BOUGHT IT ALL THAT IS IN THE GROUND ABOVE THE
GROUND OR THAT MAY FALL FROM THE SKY UPON THESE PREMISES
IX
THE MUTUAL SIEGE LASTED UNTIL AFTER SEVEN O'CLOCK BUT IT WAS RATHER
ONE SIDED
THE VAN KAMPS COULD DRINK ALL THE WATER THEY LIKED IT MADE
THEM NO HUNGRIER
IF THE ELLSWORTHS ATE ANYTHING HOWEVER THEY GREW
THIRSTIER AND MOREOVER WATER WAS NECESSARY IF ANYTHING WORTH WHILE
WAS TO BE COOKED
THEY KNEW ALL THIS AND RESISTED UNTIL MRS
ELLSWORTH WAS TEMPTED AND FELL
SHE ATE A SANDWICH AND CHOKED
IT WAS
HEARTBREAKING BUT RALPH HAD TO BE SENT DOWN WITH A PLATE OF
SANDWICHES AND AN OFFER TO TRADE THEM FOR WATER
HALFWAY BETWEEN THE PUMP AND THE HOUSE HE MET EVELYN COMING WITH A
SMALL PAIL OF THE PRECIOUS FLUID
THEY BOTH STOPPED STOCK STILL THEN
SEEING THAT IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT BOTH LAUGHED AND ADVANCED
WHO WINS NOW BANTERED RALPH AS THEY MADE THE EXCHANGE
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE A MISDEAL SHE GAILY REPLIED AND WAS MOVING
AWAY WHEN HE CALLED HER BACK
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THE GATELY'S OF NEW YORK DO YOU HE WAS
QUITE ANXIOUS TO KNOW
I AM TRULY SORRY BUT I AM ACQUAINTED WITH SO FEW PEOPLE IN NEW YORK
WE ARE FROM CHICAGO YOU KNOW
OH SAID HE BLANKLY AND TOOK THE WATER UP TO THE ELLSWORTH SUITE
MRS
ELLSWORTH CHEERED UP CONSIDERABLY WHEN SHE HEARD THAT RALPH HAD
BEEN MET HALFWAY BUT HER EYES SNAPPED WHEN HE CONFESSED THAT IT WAS
MISS VAN KAMP WHO HAD MET HIM
I HOPE YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CARRY ON A FLIRTATION WITH THAT
OVERDRESSED CREATURE SHE BLAZED
WHY MOTHER EXCLAIMED RALPH SHOCKED BEYOND MEASURE
WHAT RIGHT
HAVE YOU TO ACCUSE EITHER THIS YOUNG LADY OR MYSELF OF FLIRTING
FLIRTING
MRS
ELLSWORTH SUDDENLY ATTACKED THE FIRE WITH QUITE UNNECESSARY
ENERGY
X
DOWN AT THE BARN THE WIDE THRESHING FLOOR HAD BEEN COVERED WITH GAY
RAG RUGS AND STREWN WITH TABLES COUCHES AND CHAIRS IN PICTURESQUE
PROFUSION
ROOMY BOX STALLS HAD BEEN CARPETED DEEP WITH CLEAN STRAW
CURTAINED OFF WITH GAUDY BED QUILTS AND CONVERTED INTO COZY SLEEPING
APARTMENTS
THE MOW AND THE STALLS HAD BEEN SCREENED OFF WITH LACE
CURTAINS AND BLAZING COUNTERPANES AND THE WHOLE EFFECT WAS ONE OF
ORIENTAL LUXURY AND SPLENDOR
ALAS IT WAS ONLY AN EFFECT THE
RED HOT PARLOR STOVE SMOKED ABOMINABLY THE PIPE CARRIED OTHER SMOKE
OUT THROUGH THE HAWMOW WINDOW ONLY TO LET IT BLOW BACK AGAIN
CHILL
CROSS DRAUGHTS WHISTLED IN FROM CRACKS TOO NUMEROUS TO BE STOPPED UP
AND THE MISERABLE VAN KAMPS COULD ONLY COUGH AND SHIVER AND ENVY THE
TUTTS AND THE DRIVER NON COMBATANTS WHO HAD BEEN FED TWO HOURS
BEFORE
UP IN THE SECOND FLOOR SUITE THERE WAS A ROARING FIRE IN THE BIG
FIREPLACE BUT THERE WAS A CHILL IN THE ROOM THAT NO MERE FIRE COULD
DRIVE AWAY THE CHILL OF ABSOLUTE EMPTINESS
A MAN CAN OUTLIVE HARDSHIPS THAT WOULD KILL A WOMAN BUT A WOMAN CAN
ENDURE DISCOMFORTS THAT WOULD DRIVE A MAN CRAZY
MR
ELLSWORTH WENT OUT TO HUNT UP UNCLE BILLY WITH AN ESPECIAL SOLACE
IN MIND
THE LANDLORD WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE BUT THE YELLOW GLEAM OF A
LANTERN REVEALED HIS PRESENCE IN THE WOODSHED AND MR
ELLSWORTH
STEPPED IN UPON HIM JUST AS HE WAS POURING SOMETHING YELLOW AND CLEAR
INTO A TUMBLER FROM A BIG JUG THAT HE HAD JUST TAKEN FROM UNDER THE
FLOORING
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR THAT JUG AND ITS CONTENTS HE ASKED WITH A
SIGH OF GRATITUDE THAT THIS SUPPLY HAD BEEN OVERLOOKED
BEFORE MR
TUTT COULD ANSWER MR
VAN KAMP HURRIED IN AT THE DOOR
WAIT A MOMENT HE CRIED
I WANT TO BID ON THAT
THIS HERE JUG HAIN'T FER SALE AT NO PRICE UNCLE BILLY EMPHATICALLY
ANNOUNCED NIPPING ALL NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT IN THE BUD
IT'S TOO PESKY
HARD TO SNEAK THIS HERE LICKER IN PAST MARGE'T BUT I RECKON IT'S MY
TREAT GENTS
YE KIN HAVE ALL YE WANT
ONE MINUTE LATER MR
VAN KAMP AND MR
ELLSWORTH WERE SEATED ONE ON A
SAWBUCK AND THE OTHER ON A NAIL KEG COMFORTABLY EYEING EACH OTHER
ACROSS THE WORK BENCH AND EACH WAS HOLDING UP A TUMBLER ONE THIRD
FILLED WITH THE GOLDEN YELLOW LIQUID
YOUR HEALTH SIR COURTEOUSLY PROPOSED MR
ELLSWORTH
AND TO YOU SIR GRAVELY REPLIED MR
VAN KAMP
XI
RALPH AND EVELYN HAPPENED TO MEET AT THE PUMP QUITE ACCIDENTALLY
AFTER THE FORMER HAD MADE HALF A DOZEN FIVE MINUTE APART TRIPS FOR A
DRINK
IT WAS MISS VAN KAMP THIS TIME WHO HAD BEEN STUDYING ON THE
MUTUAL ACQUAINTANCE PROBLEM
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THE TYLERS OF PARKERSBURG DO YOU SHE
ASKED
THE TYLERS I SHOULD SAY I DO WAS THE UNEXPECTED AND ENTHUSIASTIC
REPLY
WHY WE ARE ON OUR WAY NOW TO MISS GEORGIANA TYLER'S WEDDING
TO MY FRIEND JIMMY CARSTON
I'M TO BE BEST MAN
HOW DELIGHTFUL SHE EXCLAIMED
WE ARE ON THE WAY THERE TOO
GEORGIANA WAS MY DEAREST CHUM AT SCHOOL AND I AM TO BE HER 'BEST
GIRL
LET'S GO AROUND ON THE PORCH AND SIT DOWN SAID RALPH
XII
MR
VAN KAMP BACK IN THE WOODSHED LOOKED ABOUT HIM WITH AN EYE OF
CONTENT
RATHER COZY FOR A WOODSHED HE OBSERVED
I WONDER IF WE COULDN'T
SCARE UP A LITTLE SESSION OF DOLLAR LIMIT
BOTH UNCLE BILLY AND MR
ELLSWORTH WERE WILLING
DEATH AND POKER LEVEL
ALL AMERICANS
A FOURTH HAND WAS NEEDED HOWEVER
THE STAGE DRIVER WAS
IN BED AND ASLEEP AND MR
ELLSWORTH VOLUNTEERED TO FIND THE EXTRA
PLAYER
I'LL GET RALPH HE SAID
HE PLAYS A FAIRLY STIFF GAME HE FINALLY
FOUND HIS SON ON THE PORCH APPARENTLY ALONE AND STATED HIS ERRAND
THANK YOU BUT I DON'T BELIEVE I CARE TO PLAY THIS EVENING WAS THE
ASTOUNDING REPLY AND MR
ELLSWORTH LOOKED CLOSER
HE MADE OUT THEN
A DIM FIGURE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF RALPH
OH OF COURSE NOT HE BLUNDERED AND WENT BACK TO THE WOODSHED
THREE HANDED POKER IS A MISERABLE GAME AND IT SELDOM LASTS LONG
IT
DID NOT IN THIS CASE
AFTER UNCLE BILLY HAD WON THE ONLY JACK POT
DESERVING OF THE NAME HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO BLISSFULLY TO SLEEP WITH
HIS HAND ON THE HANDLE OF THE BIG JUG
AFTER POKER THERE IS ONLY ONE OTHER ALWAYS AVAILABLE AMUSEMENT FOR
MEN AND THAT IS BUSINESS
THE TWO TRAVELERS WERE QUITE WELL
ACQUAINTED WHEN RALPH PUT HIS HEAD IN AT THE DOOR
THOUGHT I'D FIND YOU HERE HE EXPLAINED
IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME TO
WONDER WHETHER YOU GENTLEMEN HAD DISCOVERED AS YET THAT WE ARE ALL
TO BE HOUSE GUESTS AT THE CARSTON TYLER WEDDING
WHY NO EXCLAIMED HIS FATHER IN PLEASED SURPRISE
IT IS A MOST
AGREEABLE COINCIDENCE
MR
VAN KAMP ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MY SON
RALPH
MR
VAN KAMP AND MYSELF RALPH HAVE FOUND OUT THAT WE SHALL BE
CONSIDERABLY THROWN TOGETHER IN A BUSINESS WAY FROM NOW ON
HE HAS
JUST PURCHASED CONTROL OF THE METROPOLITAN AND WESTERN STRING OF
INTERURBANS
DELIGHTED I'M SURE MURMURED RALPH SHAKING HANDS AND THEN HE
SLIPPED OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
SOME ONE SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR
HIM
PERHAPS ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES HAD PASSED WHEN ONE OF THE MEN HAD AN
ILLUMINATING IDEA THAT RESULTED LATER ON IN PLEASANT RELATIONS FOR
ALL OF THEM
IT WAS ABOUT TIME FOR MRS
ELLSWORTH UP IN THE BARE
SUITE AND MRS
VAN KAMP DOWN IN THE DRAUGHTY BARN BOTH WRAPPED UP
TO THE CHIN AND BOTH STILL CHILLY HAD ABOUT REACHED THE LIMIT OF
PATIENCE AND ENDURANCE
WHY CAN'T WE MAKE THINGS A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE FOR ALL
CONCERNED SUGGESTED MR
VAN KAMP
SUPPOSE AS A STARTER THAT WE
HAVE MRS
VAN KAMP GIVE A SHIVER PARTY DOWN IN THE BARN
GOOD IDEA AGREED MR
ELLSWORTH
A LITTLE DIPLOMACY WILL DO IT
EACH ONE OF US WILL HAVE TO TELL HIS WIFE THAT THE OTHER FELLOW MADE
THE FIRST ABJECT OVERTURES
MR
VAN KAMP GRINNED UNDERSTANDINGLY AND AGREED TO THE INFAMOUS RUSE
BY THE WAY CONTINUED MR
ELLSWORTH WITH A STILL HAPPIER THOUGHT
YOU MUST ALLOW MRS
ELLSWORTH TO FURNISH THE DINNER FOR MRS
VAN
KAMP'S SHIVER PARTY
DINNER GASPED MR
VAN KAMP
BY ALL MEANS
BOTH MEN FELT AN ANXIOUS YAWNING IN THE REGION OF THE APPETITE AND A
YEARNING MOISTURE WETTED THEIR TONGUES
THEY LOOKED AT THE SLUMBERING
UNCLE BILLY AND DECIDED TO SEE MRS
TUTT THEMSELVES ABOUT A GOOD HOT
DINNER FOR SIX
LAW ME EXCLAIMED AUNT MARGARET WHEN THEY APPEARED AT THE KITCHEN
DOOR
I SWAN I THOUGHT YOU FOLKS 'U'D NEVER COME TO YORE SENSES
HERE
I'VE HAD A BIG POT O' STEWED CHICKEN READY ON THE STOVE FER TWO MORTAL
HOURS
I KIN GIVE YE THAT AN' SMASHED TATERS AN' CHICKEN GRAVY AN'
DRIED CORN AN' HOT CORN PONE AN' CURRANT JELL AN' STRAWBERRY
PRESERVES AN' MY OWN CANNIN' O' PEACHES AN' PUMPKIN PIE AN' COFFEE
WILL THAT DO YE WOULD IT DO WOULD IT DO
AS AUNT MARGARET TALKED THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG WIDE AND THE TWO MEN
WERE STRICKEN SPEECHLESS WITH ASTONISHMENT
THERE ACROSS FROM EACH
OTHER AT THE KITCHEN TABLE SAT THE UTTERLY SELFISH AND TRAITOROUS
YOUNGER MEMBERS OF THE RIVAL HOUSES OF ELLSWORTH AND VAN KAMP DEEP IN
THE JOYS OF CHICKEN AND MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY AND HOT
CORN PONE AND ALL THE OTHER FIXINGS LAUGHING AND CHATTING GAILY
LIKE CHUMS OF YEARS' STANDING
THEY HAD SEEMINGLY JUST COME TO AN
AGREEMENT ABOUT SOMETHING OR OTHER FOR EVELYN WAVING THE SHORTER END
OF A BROKEN WISHBONE WAS VIVACIOUSLY SAYING TO RALPH

A CALL

FROM HARPER'S MAGAZINE AUGUST 1906
COPYRIGHT 1906 BY HARPER
BROTHERS
REPUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR'S PERMISSION
A BOY IN AN UNNATURALLY CLEAN COUNTRY LAUNDERED COLLAR WALKED DOWN A
LONG WHITE ROAD
HE SCUFFED THE DUST UP WANTONLY FOR HE WISHED TO
VEIL THE ALL TOO BRILLIANT POLISH OF HIS COWHIDE SHOES
ALSO THE
MEMORY OF THE WHITENESS AND SLIPPERINESS OF HIS COLLAR OPPRESSED HIM
HE WAS FAIN TO LOOK LIKE ONE ACCUSTOMED TO SOCIAL DIVERSIONS A MAN
HURRIED FROM HALL TO HALL OF PLEASURE WITHOUT TIME BETWEEN TO CHANGE
COLLAR OR POLISH BOOT
HE STOOPED AND RUBBED A CRUMB OF EARTH ON HIS
OVERFRESH NECK LINEN
THIS DID NOT LONG SUSTAIN HIS DROOPING SPIRIT
HE WAS MENTALLY ADRIFT
UPON THE HINTS AND HELPS TO YOUNG MEN IN BUSINESS AND SOCIAL
RELATIONS WHICH HAD SUGGESTED TO HIM HIS PRESENT ENTERPRISE WHEN
THE APPEARANCE OF A SECOND YOUTH TALLER AND BROADER THAN HIMSELF
WITH A SHOCK OF LIGHT CURLING HAIR AND A CROP OF FRECKLES THAT
ADVERTISED A RICH SOIL THREW HIM A LIFELINE
HE PUT HIS THUMBS TO HIS
LIPS AND WHISTLED IN A PECULIARLY EAR SPLITTING WAY
THE TWO BOYS HAD
SAT ON THE SAME BENCH AT SUNDAY SCHOOL NOT THREE HOURS BEFORE YET
WHAT A CHANGE HAD COME OVER THE WORLD FOR ONE OF THEM SINCE THEN
HELLO WHERE YOU GOIN' AB ASKED THE NEWCOMER GRUFFLY
CALLIN' REPLIED THE BOY IN THE COLLAR LACONICALLY BUT WITH
CAREFULLY AVERTED GAZE
ON THE GIRLS INQUIRED THE OTHER AWESTRUCK
IN MOUNT PISGAH YOU SAW
THE GIRLS HOME FROM NIGHT CHURCH SOCIALS OR PARTIES YOU COULD HANG
OVER THE GATE AND YOU MIGHT WALK WITH A GIRL IN THE CEMETERY OF A
SUNDAY AFTERNOON BUT TO RING A FRONT DOOR BELL AND ASK FOR MISS
HEART'S DESIRE ONE MUST HAVE BEEN IN LONG TROUSERS AT LEAST THREE
YEARS AND THE TWO BOYS CONFRONTED IN THE DUSTY ROAD HAD WORN THESE
DIGNIFYING GARMENTS BARELY SIX MONTHS
GIRLS SAID ABNER LOFTILY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GIRLS I'M JUST
GOING TO CALL ON ONE GIRL CHAMPE CLAIBORNE HE MARCHED ON AS THOUGH
THE CONVERSATION WAS AT AN END BUT ROSS HUNG UPON HIS FLANK
ROSS AND
CHAMPE WERE NEIGHBORS COMRADES IN ALL SORTS OF MISCHIEF HE WAS IN
DOUBT WHETHER TO HALT ABNER AND PUMMEL HIM OR PROPOSE TO ENLIST UNDER
HIS BANNER
DO YOU RECKON YOU COULD HE DEBATED TROTTING ALONG BY THE
IRRESPONSIVE JILTON BOY
RUN HOME TO YOUR MOTHER GROWLED THE ORIGINATOR OF THE PLAN
SAVAGELY
YOU AIN'T OLD ENOUGH TO CALL ON GIRLS ANYBODY CAN SEE
THAT BUT I AM AND I'M GOING TO CALL ON CHAMPE CLAIBORNE
AGAIN THE NAME ACTED AS A SPUR ON ROSS
WITH YOUR COLLAR AND BOOTS
ALL DIRTY HE JEERED
THEY WON'T KNOW YOU'RE CALLIN'
THE BOY IN THE ROAD STOPPED SHORT IN HIS DUSTY TRACKS
HE WAS AN
INTENSE CREATURE AND HE WHITENED AT THE TRAGIC INSINUATION LONGING
FOR THE WHOLESOME STAY AND COMPANIONSHIP OF FRECKLE FACED ROSS
I PUT
THE DIRT ON O' PURPOSE SO'S TO LOOK KIND OF CARELESS HE HALF
WHISPERED IN AN AGONY OF DOUBT
S'POSE I'D BETTER GO INTO YOUR HOUSE
AND TRY TO WASH IT OFF RECKON YOUR MOTHER WOULD LET ME
I'VE GOT TWO CLEAN COLLARS ANNOUNCED THE OTHER BOY PROUDLY
GENEROUS
I'LL LEND YOU ONE
YOU CAN PUT IT ON WHILE I'M GETTING
READY
I'LL TELL MOTHER THAT WE'RE JUST STEPPING OUT TO DO A LITTLE
CALLING ON THE GIRLS
HERE WAS AN ALLY WORTHY OF THE CAUSE
ABNER WELCOMED HIM IN SPITE OF
CERTAIN JEALOUS TWINGES
HE REFLECTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT THERE
WERE TWO CLAIBORNE GIRLS AND THOUGH ALICIA WAS SO STIFF AND PRIM THAT
NO BOY WOULD EVER THINK OF CALLING ON HER THERE WAS STILL THE HOPE
THAT SHE MIGHT DRAW ROSS'S FIRE AND LEAVE HIM ABNER TO MAKE THE
NUMEROUS REMARKS HE HAD STORED UP IN HIS MIND FROM HINTS AND HELPS TO
YOUNG MEN IN SOCIAL AND BUSINESS RELATIONS TO CHAMPE ALONE
MRS
PRYOR RECEIVED THEM WITH THE EASY GOING KINDNESS OF THE MOTHER OF
ONE SON
SHE FOLLOWED THEM INTO THE DINING ROOM TO KISS AND FEED HIM
WITH AN ABSENT HOWDY ABNER HOW'S YOUR MOTHER
ABNER BIG WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR MUTUAL INTENTION INCLINED HIS
HEAD STIFFLY AND LOOKED TOWARD ROSS FOR EXPLANATION
HE TREMBLED A
LITTLE BUT IT WAS WITH DELIGHT AS HE ANTICIPATED THE EFFECT OF THE
SPEECH ROSS HAD OUTLINED
BUT IT DID NOT COME
I'M NOT HUNGRY MOTHER WAS THE REVISED EDITION WHICH THE
FRECKLE FACED BOY OFFERED TO THE MATERNAL EAR
I WE ARE GOING OVER
TO MR
CLAIBORNE'S ON ER ON AN ERRAND FOR ABNER'S FATHER
THE BLACK EYED BOY LOOKED REPROACH AS THEY CLATTERED UP THE STAIRS TO
ROSS'S ROOM WHERE THE CLEAN COLLAR WAS PRODUCED AND A SMALL STOCK OF
TIES
YOU'D WEAR A NECKTIE WOULDN'T YOU ROSS ASKED SPREADING THEM UPON
THE BUREAU TOP
YES
BUT MAKE IT FALL CARELESSLY OVER YOUR SHIRT FRONT ADVISED THE
STUDENT OF HINTS AND HELPS
YOUR COLLAR IS MILES TOO BIG FOR ME
SAY I'VE GOT A WAD OF WHITE CHEWING GUM WOULD YOU FLAT IT OUT AND
STICK IT OVER THE COLLAR BUTTON MAYBE THAT WOULD FILL UP SOME
YOU
KICK MY FOOT IF YOU SEE ME TURNING MY HEAD SO'S TO KNOCK IT OFF
BETTER BUTTON UP YOUR VEST CAUTIONED ROSS LABORING WITH THE
CARELESS FALL OF HIS TIE
HUH UH I WANT 'THAT EASY AIR WHICH PRESUPPOSES FAMILIARITY WITH
SOCIETY' THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS IN MY BOOK OBJECTED ABNER
SURE ROSS RETURNED TO HIS MORE FAMILIAR JEERING ATTITUDE
LOOSEN
UP ALL YOUR CLOTHES THEN
WHY DON'T YOU UNTIE YOUR SHOES FLOP A SOCK
DOWN OVER ONE OF 'EM THAT LOOKS 'EASY' ALL RIGHT
ABNER BUTTONED HIS VEST
IT GIVES A MAN LOTS OF CONFIDENCE TO KNOW
HE'S GOOD LOOKING HE REMARKED TAKING ALL THE ROOM IN FRONT OF THE
MIRROR
ROSS AT THE WASH STAND SOAKING HIS HAIR TO GET THE CURL OUT OF IT
GRUMBLED SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE RESPONSE
THE TWO BOYS WENT DOWN THE
STAIRS WITH TREMULOUS HEARTS
WHY YOU'VE PUT ON ANOTHER CLEAN SHIRT ROSSIE MRS
PRYOR CALLED
FROM HER CHAIR MOTHERS' EYES CAN SEE SO FAR WELL DON'T GET INTO
ANY DIRTY PLAY AND SOIL IT THE BOYS WALKED IN SILENCE BUT IT WAS A
PREGNANT SILENCE FOR AS THE ROOF OF THE CLAIBORNE HOUSE BEGAN TO PEER
ABOVE THE CREST OF THE HILL ROSS PLUMPED DOWN ON A STONE AND
ANNOUNCED I AIN'T GOIN'
COME ON URGED THE BLACK EYED BOY
IT'LL BE FUN AND EVERYBODY WILL
RESPECT US MORE
CHAMPE WON'T THROW ROCKS AT US IN RECESS TIME AFTER
WE'VE CALLED ON HER
SHE COULDN'T
CALLED GRUNTED ROSS
I COULDN'T MAKE A CALL ANY MORE THAN A COW
WHAT'D I SAY WHAT'D I DO I CAN BEHAVE ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU JUST GO TO
PEOPLE'S HOUSES BUT A CALL
ABNER HESITATED
SHOULD HE GIVE AWAY HIS BRILLIANT INSIDE INFORMATION
DRAWN FROM THE HINTS AND HELPS BOOK AND BE RIVALLED IN THE GLORY OF
HIS MANNERS AND BEARING WHY SHOULD HE NOT PASS ON ALONE PERFECTLY
COMPOSED AND REAP THE FIELD OF GLORY UNSUPPORTED HIS KNEES GAVE WAY
AND HE SAT DOWN WITHOUT INTENDING IT
DON'T YOU TELL ANYBODY AND I'LL PUT YOU ON TO EXACTLY WHAT GROWN UP
GENTLEMEN SAY AND DO WHEN THEY GO CALLING ON THE GIRLS HE BEGAN
FIRE AWAY RETORTED ROSS GLOOMILY
NOBODY WILL FIND OUT FROM ME
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES
IF I'M FOOL ENOUGH TO GO I DON'T EXPECT TO
COME OUT OF IT ALIVE
ABNER ROSE WHITE AND SHAKING AND THRUSTING THREE FINGERS INTO THE
BUTTONING OF HIS VEST EXTENDING THE OTHER HAND LIKE AN ORATOR
PROCEEDED TO INSTRUCT THE FRECKLED PERSPIRING DISCIPLE AT HIS FEET
'HANG YOUR HAT ON THE RACK OR GIVE IT TO A SERVANT ROSS NODDED
INTELLIGENTLY
HE COULD DO THAT
'LET YOUR LEGS BE GRACEFULLY DISPOSED ONE HAND ON THE KNEE THE
OTHER
ABNER CAME TO AN UNHAPPY PAUSE
I FORGET WHAT A FELLOW DOES WITH THE
OTHER HAND
MIGHT STICK IT IN YOUR POCKET LOUDLY OR EXPECTORATE ON
THE CARPET
INDULGE IN LITTLE FRIVOLITY
LET A RICH STREAM OF
CONVERSATION FLOW
ROSS MENTALLY DUG WITHIN HIMSELF FOR SOURCES OF RICH STREAMS OF
CONVERSATION
HE FOUND A DRY SOIL
WHAT YOU GOIN' TO TALK ABOUT HE
DEMANDED FRETFULLY
I WON'T GO A STEP FARTHER TILL I KNOW WHAT I'M
GOIN' TO SAY WHEN I GET THERE
ABNER BEGAN TO REPEAT PARAGRAPHS FROM HINTS AND HELPS
'IT IS BEST
TO REMARK HE OPENED IN AN UNNATURAL VOICE 'HOW WELL YOU ARE
LOOKING ALTHOUGH FULSOME COMPLIMENTS SHOULD BE AVOIDED
WHEN SEATED
ASK THE YOUNG LADY WHO HER FAVORITE COMPOSER IS
WHAT'S A COMPOSER INQUIRED ROSS WITH VISIONS OF SOOTHING SYRUP IN

FRECKLED BOY HIS BIG PUPILS CONTRACTED EACH TIME ABNER CAME TO THE
REPETEND NAME YOURS
I'M TIRED ALREADY HE GRUMBLED BUT SOME SPELL MADE HIM RISE AND
FARE FARTHER
WHEN THEY HAD ENTERED THE CLAIBORNE GATE THEY LEANED TOWARD EACH
OTHER LIKE YOUNG SAPLINGS WEAKENED AT THE ROOT AND LOCKING BRANCHES TO
KEEP WHAT SHALLOW FOOTHOLD ON EARTH REMAINED
YOU'RE GOIN' IN FIRST ASSERTED ROSS BUT WITHOUT CONVICTION
IT WAS
HIS CUSTOM TO TEAR UP TO THIS HOUSE A DOZEN TIMES A WEEK ON HIS
FATHER'S OLD HORSE OR AFOOT HE WAS WONT TO YELL FOR CHAMPE AS HE
APPROACHED AND QUARREL JOYOUSLY WITH HER WHILE HE PERFORMED SUCH
ERRAND AS HE HAD COME UPON BUT HE WAS GAGGED AND HAMSTRUNG NOW BY THE
HYPNOTISM OF ABNER'S SCHEME
'WALK QUIETLY UP THE STEPS RING THE BELL AND LAY YOUR CARD ON THE
SERVANT QUOTED ABNER WHO HAD NEVER HEARD OF A SERVER

WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN AFTER WE GET RID OF THE CARD
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HANGING YOUR HAT ON THE RACK AND DISPOSING YOUR

AUNT MISSOURI CLAIBORNE PLACIDLY ROCKING ON THE FRONT PORCH DIRECTED
TO MOUNT STEPS AND RING BELL TO LAY CARDS UPON THE SERVANT HOW
SHOULD ONE DEAL WITH A ROSY FACED PLUMP LADY OF UNCERTAIN YEARS IN A
ROCKING CHAIR
WHAT SHOULD A CALLER LAY UPON HER A LION IN THE WAY
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE TERRIFYING
EVEN RETREAT WAS CUT OFF
AUNT
MISSOURI HAD SEEN THEM
HOWDY BOYS HOW ARE YOU SHE SAID ROCKING
PEACEFULLY
THE TWO STOOD BEFORE HER LIKE DETECTED CRIMINALS
THEN TO ROSS'S DISMAY ABNER SANK DOWN ON THE LOWEST STEP OF THE
PORCH THE WESTERING SUN FULL IN HIS HOPELESS EYES
HE SAT ON HIS CAP
IT WAS CHARACTERISTIC THAT THE FRECKLED BOY REMAINED STANDING
HE
WOULD WALK UP THOSE STEPS ACCORDING TO PLAN AND AGREEMENT IF AT ALL
HE ACCEPTED NO COMPROMISE
FOLDING HIS STRAW HAT INTO A BATTERED CONE
HE WATCHED ANXIOUSLY FOR THE DELIVERY OF THE CARD
HE WAS NOT SURE
WHAT AUNT MISSOURI'S ATTITUDE MIGHT BE IF IT WERE LAID ON HER
HE BENT
DOWN TO HIS COMPANION
GO AHEAD HE WHISPERED
LAY THE CARD
ABNER RAISED APPEALING EYES
IN A MINUTE
GIVE ME TIME HE PLEADED
MARS' ROSS MARS' ROSS HEAD 'EM OFF SOUNDED A YELL AND BABE THE
HOUSE BOY CAME AROUND THE PORCH IN PURSUIT OF TWO HALF GROWN
CHICKENS
HELP HIM ROSSIE PROMPTED AUNT MISSOURI SHARPLY
YOU BOYS CAN
STAY TO SUPPER AND HAVE SOME OF THE CHICKEN IF YOU HELP CATCH THEM
HAD ROSS TAKEN TIME TO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED THAT GENTLEMEN
MAKING FORMAL CALLS SELDOM JOIN IN A CHASE AFTER THE MAIN DISH OF THE
FAMILY SUPPER
BUT THE NEEDS OF BABE WERE INSTANT
THE LAD FLUNG
HIMSELF SIDEWISE CAUGHT ONE CHICKEN IN HIS HAT WHILE BABE FELL UPON
THE OTHER IN THE MANNER OF A FOOTBALL PLAYER
ROSS HANDED THE PULLET
TO THE HOUSE BOY FEARING THAT HE HAD DONE SOMETHING VERY MUCH OUT OF
CHARACTER THEN PULLED THE RELUCTANT NEGRO TOWARD TO THE STEPS
BABE'S A SERVANT HE WHISPERED TO ABNER WHO HAD SAT RIGID THROUGH
THE ENTIRE PERFORMANCE
I HELPED HIM WITH THE CHICKENS AND HE'S GOT
TO STAND GENTLE WHILE YOU LAY THE CARD ON
CONFRONTED BY THE ACT ITSELF ABNER WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT HE KNEW
NOT HOW TO BEGIN
HE TOOK REFUGE IN DISSIMULATION
HUSH HE WHISPERED BACK
DON'T YOU SEE MR
CLAIBORNE'S COME
OUT HE'S GOING TO READ SOMETHING TO US
ROSS PLUMPED DOWN BESIDE HIM
NEVER MIND THE CARD TELL 'EM HE
URGED
TELL 'EM YOURSELF
NO LET'S CUT AND RUN
I I THINK THE WORST OF IT IS OVER
WHEN CHAMPE SEES US SHE'LL
MENTION OF CHAMPE STIFFENED ROSS'S SPINE
IF IT HAD BEEN GLORIOUS TO
CALL UPON HER HOW VERY TERRIBLE SHE WOULD MAKE IT SHOULD THEY ATTEMPT
CALLING FAIL AND THE FAILURE COME TO HER KNOWLEDGE SOME THINGS WERE
EASIER TO ENDURE THAN OTHERS HE RESOLVED TO STAY TILL THE CALL WAS
MADE
FOR HALF AN HOUR THE BOYS SAT WITH DROOPING HEADS AND THE OLD
GENTLEMAN READ ALOUD PRESUMABLY TO AUNT MISSOURI AND THEMSELVES
FINALLY THEIR RESTLESS EYES DISCERNED THE TWO CLAIBORNE GIRLS WALKING
SERENE IN SUNDAY TRIM UNDER THE TREES AT THE EDGE OF THE LAWN
ARMS
ENTWINED THEY WERE WHISPERING TOGETHER AND GIGGLING A LITTLE
A
CALLER ROSS DARED NOT USE HIS VOICE TO SHOUT NOR HIS LEGS TO RUN
TOWARD THEM
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND TALK TO THE GIRLS ROSSIE AUNT MISSOURI ASKED
IN THE KINDNESS OF HER HEART
DON'T BE NOISY IT'S SUNDAY YOU
KNOW AND DON'T GET TO PLAYING ANYTHING THAT'LL DIRTY UP YOUR GOOD
CLOTHES
ROSS PRESSED HIS LIPS HARD TOGETHER HIS HEART SWELLED WITH THE RAGE
OF THE MISUNDERSTOOD
HAD THE CARD BEEN IN HIS POSSESSION HE WOULD
AT THAT INSTANT HAVE LAID IT ON AUNT MISSOURI WITHOUT A QUALM
WHAT IS IT DEMANDED THE OLD GENTLEMAN A BIT TESTILY
THE GIRLS WANT TO HEAR YOU READ FATHER SAID AUNT MISSOURI
SHREWDLY AND SHE GOT UP AND TROTTED ON SHORT FAT ANKLES TO THE GIRLS
IN THE ARBOR
THE THREE RETURNED TOGETHER ALICIA CASTING CURIOUS
GLANCES AT THE UNCOMFORTABLE YOUTHS CHAMPE THREATENING TO BURST INTO
GIGGLES WITH EVERY BREATH
ABNER SAT HARD ON HIS CAP AND BLUSHED SILENTLY
ROSS TWISTED HIS HAT
INTO A THREE CORNERED WRECK
THE TWO GIRLS SETTLED THEMSELVES NOISILY ON THE UPPER STEP
THE OLD
MAN READ ON AND ON
THE SUN SANK LOWER
THE HILLS WERE RED IN THE WEST
AS THOUGH A BRUSH FIRE FLAMED BEHIND THEIR CRESTS
ABNER STOLE A
FURTIVE GLANCE AT HIS COMPANION IN MISERY AND THE DOLOR OF ROSS'S
COUNTENANCE SOMEWHAT ASSUAGED HIS ANGUISH
THE FRECKLE FACED BOY WAS
THINKING OF THE VILLAGE OVER THE HILL A CERTAIN PLEASANT WHITE HOUSE
SET BACK IN A GREEN YARD PAST WHOSE GATE THE TWO PLANK SIDEWALK RAN
HE KNEW LAMPS WERE BEGINNING TO WINK IN THE WINDOWS OF THE NEIGHBORS
ABOUT AS THOUGH THE HOUSES SAID OUR BOYS ARE ALL AT HOME BUT ROSS
PRYOR'S OUT TRYING TO CALL ON THE GIRLS AND CAN'T GET ANYBODY TO
UNDERSTAND IT OH THAT HE WERE WALKING DOWN THOSE TWO PLANKS
DRAWING A STICK ACROSS THE PICKETS LIFTING HIGH HAPPY FEET WHICH
COULD TURN IN AT THAT GATE HE WOULDN'T CARE WHAT THE LAMPS SAID THEN
HE WOULDN'T EVEN MIND IF THE WHOLE CLAIBORNE FAMILY DIED LAUGHING AT
HIM IF ONLY SOME POWER WOULD RAISE HIM UP FROM THIS PARALYZING SPOT
AND PUT HIM BEHIND THE SAFE BARRIERS OF HIS OWN HOME
THE OLD MAN'S VOICE LAPSED INTO SILENCE THE LIGHT WAS BECOMING TOO
DIM FOR HIS READING
AUNT MISSOURI TURNED AND CALLED OVER HER SHOULDER
INTO THE SHADOWS OF THE BIG HALL YOU BABE GO PUT TWO EXTRA PLATES
ON THE SUPPER TABLE
THE BOYS GREW RED FROM THE TIPS OF THEIR EARS AND AS FAR AS ANY ONE
COULD SEE UNDER THEIR WILTING COLLARS
ABNER FELT THE LUMP OF GUM COME
LOOSE AND SLIP DOWN A COLD SPINE
HAD THEIR INTENTIONS BUT BEEN KNOWN
THIS INFERENTIAL INVITATION WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST WELCOME
IT WAS BUT
TO RISE UP AND THUNDER OUT WE CAME TO CALL ON THE YOUNG LADIES
THEY DID NOT RISE
THEY DID NOT THUNDER OUT ANYTHING
BABE BROUGHT A
LAMP AND SET IT INSIDE THE WINDOW AND MR
CLAIBORNE RESUMED HIS
READING
CHAMPE GIGGLED AND SAID THAT ALICIA MADE HER
ALCIA DREW HER
SKIRTS ABOUT HER SNIFFED AND LOOKED VIRTUOUS AND SAID SHE DIDN'T
SEE ANYTHING FUNNY TO LAUGH AT
THE SUPPER BELL RANG
THE FAMILY
EVIDENTLY TAKING IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE BOYS WOULD FOLLOW WENT IN
ALONE FOR THE FIRST TIME ABNER GAVE UP
THIS AIN'T ANY USE HE
COMPLAINED
WE AIN'T CALLING ON ANYBODY
WHY DIDN'T YOU LAY ON THE CARD DEMANDED ROSS FIERCELY
WHY
DIDN'T YOU SAY 'WE'VE JUST DROPPED INTO CALL ON MISS CHAMPE
IT'S A
PLEASANT EVENING
WE FEEL WE MUST BE GOING LIKE YOU SAID YOU WOULD
THEN WE COULD HAVE LIFTED OUR HATS AND GOT AWAY DECENTLY
ABNER SHOWED NO RESENTMENT
OH IF IT'S SO EASY WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT YOURSELF HE GROANED
SOMEBODY'S COMING ROSS MUTTERED HOARSELY
SAY IT NOW
SAY IT
QUICK
THE SOMEBODY PROVED TO BE AUNT MISSOURI WHO ADVANCED ONLY AS FAR AS
THE END OF THE HALL AND SHOUTED CHEERFULLY THE IDEA OF A GROWING BOY
NOT COMING TO MEALS WHEN THE BELL RINGS I THOUGHT YOU TWO WOULD BE IN
THERE AHEAD OF US
COME ON AND CLINGING TO THEIR HEAD COVERINGS AS
THOUGH THESE CONTAINED SOME CHARM WHEREBY THE OWNERS MIGHT BE RESCUED
THE UNHAPPY CALLERS WERE HERDED INTO THE DINING ROOM
THERE WERE MANY
THINGS ON THE TABLE THAT BOYS LIKE
BOTH WERE BECOMING FAIRLY
CHEERFUL WHEN AUNT MISSOURI CHECKED THE BISCUIT PLATE WITH I TREAT
MY NEIGHBORS' CHILDREN JUST LIKE I'D WANT CHILDREN OF MY OWN TREATED
IF YOUR MOTHERS LET YOU EAT ALL YOU WANT SAY SO AND I DON'T CARE
BUT IF EITHER OF THEM IS A LITTLE BIT PARTICULAR WHY I'D STOP AT
SIX
STILL REELING FROM THIS BLOW THE BOYS FINALLY ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND
PASSED OUT WITH THE FAMILY THEIR HATS CLUTCHED TO THEIR BOSOMS AND
CLINGING TOGETHER FOR MUTUAL AID AND COMFORT
DURING THE USUAL
SUNDAY EVENING SINGING CHAMPE LAUGHED TILL AUNT MISSOURI THREATENED TO
SEND HER TO BED
ABNER'S CARD SLIPPED FROM HIS HAND AND DROPPED FACE
UP ON THE FLOOR
HE FELL UPON IT AND TORE IT INTO INFINITESIMAL
PIECES
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOVE LETTER SAID AUNT MISSOURI IN A PAUSE OF
THE MUSIC
YOU BOYS ARE GETTING 'MOST OLD ENOUGH TO THINK ABOUT
BEGINNING TO CALL ON THE GIRLS HER EYES TWINKLED
ROSS GROWLED LIKE A STONED CUR
ABNER TOOK A SUDDEN DIVE INTO HINTS
AND HELPS AND CAME UP WITH YOU FLATTER US MISS CLAIBORNE
WHEREAT ROSS SNICKERED OUT LIKE A HUMAN BOY
THEY ALL STARED AT HIM
IT SOUNDS SO FUNNY TO CALL AUNT MISSOURI 'MIS' CLAIBORNE THE LAD
OF THE FRECKLES EXPLAINED
FUNNY AUNT MISSOURI REDDENED
I DON'T SEE ANY PARTICULAR JOKE IN
MY HAVING MY MAIDEN NAME
ABNER WHO INSTANTLY GUESSED AT WHAT WAS IN ROSS'S MIND TURNED WHITE
AT THE THOUGHT OF WHAT THEY HAD ESCAPED
SUPPOSE HE HAD LAID ON THE
CARD AND ASKED FOR MISS CLAIBORNE
WHAT'S THE MATTER CHAMPE INQUIRED ROSS IN A FAIRLY NATURAL TONE
THE AIR HE HAD DRAWN INTO HIS LUNGS WHEN HE LAUGHED AT ABNER SEEMED TO
RELIEVE HIM FROM THE NUMBING GENTILITY WHICH HAD BOUND HIS POWERS
SINCE HE JOINED ABNER'S RANKS
NOTHING
I LAUGHED BECAUSE YOU LAUGHED SAID THE GIRL
THE SINGING WENT FORWARD FITFULLY
SERVANTS TRAIPSED THROUGH THE
DARKENED YARD GOING HOME FOR SUNDAY NIGHT
AUNT MISSOURI WENT OUT AND
HELD SOME LOW TONED PARLEY WITH THEM
CHAMPE YAWNED WITH INSULTING
ENTHUSIASM
PRESENTLY BOTH GIRLS QUIETLY DISAPPEARED
AUNT MISSOURI
NEVER RETURNED TO THE PARLOR EVIDENTLY THINKING THAT THE GIRLS WOULD
ATTEND TO THE FINAL AMENITIES WITH THEIR CALLERS
THEY WERE LEFT ALONE
WITH OLD MR
CLAIBORNE
THEY SAT AS THOUGH BOUND IN THEIR CHAIRS
WHILE THE OLD MAN READ IN SILENCE FOR A WHILE
FINALLY HE CLOSED HIS
BOOK GLANCED ABOUT HIM AND OBSERVED ABSENTLY
SO YOU BOYS WERE TO SPEND THE NIGHT THEN AS HE LOOKED AT THEIR
STARTLED FACES I'M RIGHT AM I NOT YOU ARE TO SPENT THE NIGHT
OH FOR COURAGE TO SAY THANK YOU NO
WE'LL BE GOING NOW
WE JUST
CAME OVER TO CALL ON MISS CHAMPE BUT THOUGHT OF HOW THIS WOULD SOUND
IN FACE OF THE FACTS THE PAINFUL REALIZATION THAT THEY DARED NOT SAY
IT BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT SAID IT LOCKED THEIR LIPS
THEIR FEET WERE
LEAD THEIR TONGUES STIFF AND TOO LARGE FOR THEIR MOUTHS
LIKE
CREATURES IN A NIGHTMARE THEY MOVED STIFFLY ONE MIGHT HAVE SAID
CREAKINGLY UP THE STAIRS AND RECEIVED EACH A BEDROOM CANDLE
GOOD NIGHT CHILDREN SAID THE ABSENT MINDED OLD MAN
THE TWO
GURGLED OUT SOME SOUNDS WHICH WERE INTENDED FOR WORDS AND DOGED BEHIND
THE BEDROOM DOOR
THEY'VE PUT US TO BED ABNER'S BLACK EYES FLASHED FIRE
HIS NERVOUS
HANDS CLUTCHED AT THE COLLAR ROSS HAD LENT HIM
THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR
COMING HERE WITH YOU ROSS PRYOR AND TEARS OF HUMILIATION STOOD IN
HIS EYES
IN HIS TURN ROSS SHOWED NO RESENTMENT
WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS MY
MOTHER HE CONFESSED
SHE'S SO SHARP ABOUT FINDING OUT THINGS
SHE
WOULDN'T TEASE ME SHE'D JUST BE SORRY FOR ME
BUT SHE'LL THINK I WENT
HOME WITH YOU
I'D LIKE TO SEE MY MOTHER MAKE A FUSS ABOUT MY CALLING ON THE GIRLS
GROWLED ABNER GLAD TO LET HIS RAGE TAKE A SAFE DIRECTION
CALLING ON THE GIRLS HAVE WE CALLED ON ANY GIRLS DEMANDED
CLEAR HEADED HONEST ROSS
NOT EXACTLY YET ADMITTED ABNER RELUCTANTLY
COME ON LET'S GO TO
BED
MR
CLAIBORNE ASKED US AND HE'S THE HEAD OF THIS HOUSEHOLD
IT
ISN'T ANYBODY'S BUSINESS WHAT WE CAME FOR
I'LL SLIP OFF MY SHOES AND LIE DOWN TILL BABE TIES UP THE DOG IN THE
MORNING SAID ROSS
THEN WE CAN GET AWAY BEFORE ANY OF THE FAMILY IS
UP
OH YOUTH YOUTH YOUTH WITH ITS RASH PROMISES WORN OUT WITH MISERY
THE BOYS SLEPT HEAVILY
THE FIRST SOUND THAT EITHER HEARD IN THE
MORNING WAS BABE HAMMERING UPON THEIR BEDROOM DOOR
THEY CROUCHED
GUILTILY AND LOOKED INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
LET PRETEND WE AIN'T HERE
AND HE'LL GO AWAY BREATHED ABNER
BUT BABE WAS MADE OF STERNER STUFF
HE RATTLED THE KNOB
HE TURNED IT
HE PUT IN A BLACK FACE WITH A GRIN WHICH DIVIDED IT FROM EAR TO EAR
CADY SAY I MUS' CALL DEM FOOL BOYS TO BREAKFUS' HE ANNOUNCED
I
NEVER NAMED YOU ALL DAT
CADY SHE SAY DAT
BREAKFAST ECHOED ROSS IN A DAZE
YESSUH BREAKFUS' REASSERTED BABE COMING ENTIRELY INTO THE ROOM
AND LOOKING CURIOUSLY ABOUT HIM
AIN'T YOU ALL DONE BEEN TO BED AT
ALL WRAPPING HIS ARMS ABOUT HIS SHOULDERS AND SHAKING WITH SILENT
ECSTASIES OF MIRTH
THE BOYS THREW THEMSELVES UPON HIM AND EJECTED
HIM
SENT UP A SERVANT TO CALL US TO BREAKFAST SNARLED ABNER
IF THEY'D
ONLY SENT THEIR OLD SERVANT TO THE DOOR IN THE FIRST PLACE ALL THIS
WOULDN'T 'A' HAPPENED
I'M JUST THAT WAY WHEN I GET THROWN OFF THE
TRACK
YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS WHEN I TRIED TO REPEAT THOSE THINGS TO
YOU I HAD TO GO CLEAR BACK TO THE BEGINNING WHEN I GOT INTERRUPTED
DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU'RE STILL HANGING AROUND HERE TO BEGIN OVER
AND MAKE A CALL ASKED ROSS DARKLY
I WON'T GO DOWN TO BREAKFAST IF
YOU ARE
ABNER BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AS HE SAW ROSS BECOMING WORDY IN HIS RAGE
I DARE YOU TO WALK DOWNSTAIRS AND SAY
'WE JUST DROPPED IN TO CALL ON MISS CHAMPE' HE SAID
I OH I DARN IT ALL THERE GOES THE SECOND BELL
WE MAY AS WELL
TROT DOWN
DON'T LEAVE ME ROSS PLEADED THE JILTON BOY
I CAN'T STAY
HERE AND I CAN'T GO DOWN
THE TONE WAS HYSTERICAL
THE BOY WITH FRECKLES TOOK HIS COMPANION BY
THE ARM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND MARCHED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS
WE MAY
GET A CHANCE YET TO CALL ON CHAMPE ALL BY HERSELF OUT ON THE PORCH OR
IN THE ARBOR BEFORE SHE GOES TO SCHOOL HE SUGGESTED BY WAY OF
PUTTING SOME SPINE INTO THE BLACK EYED BOY
AN EMPHATIC BELL RANG WHEN THEY WERE HALF WAY DOWN THE STAIRS
CLUTCHING THEIR HATS THEY SLUNK INTO THE DINING ROOM
EVEN MR
CLAIBORNE SEEMED TO NOTICE SOMETHING UNUSUAL IN THEIR BEARING AS THEY
SETTLED INTO THE CHAIRS ASSIGNED TO THEM AND ASKED THEM KINDLY IF
THEY HAD SLEPT WELL
IT WAS PLAIN THAT AUNT MISSOURI HAD BEEN POSTING HIM AS TO HER
UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTENTIONS OF THESE YOUNG MEN
THE STATE OF
AFFAIRS GAVE AN ELECTRIC HILARITY TO THE ATMOSPHERE
BABE TRAVELLED
FROM THE SIDEBOARD TO THE TABLE TREMBLING LIKE CHOCOLATE PUDDING
CADY INSISTED ON BRINGING IN THE CAKES HERSELF AND GRINNED AS SHE
WHISKED HER STARCHED BLUE SKIRTS IN AND OUT OF THE DINING ROOM
A
DIMPLE EVEN SHOWED ITSELF AT THE CORNERS OF PRETTY ALICIA'S PRIM
LITTLE MOUTH
CHAMPE GIGGLED TILL ROSS HEARD CADY WHISPER
NOW YOU GOT ONE DEM SNICKERIN' SPELLS AGIN
YOU GWINE BUST YO' DRESS
BUTTONS OFF IN THE BACK EF YOU DON'T MIND
AS THE SPIRITS OF THOSE ABOUT THEM MOUNTED THE HEARTS OF THE TWO
YOUTHS SANK IF IT WAS LIKE THIS AMONG THE CLAIBORNES WHAT WOULD IT
BE AT SCHOOL AND IN THE WORLD AT LARGE WHEN THEIR FAILURE TO CONNECT
INTENTION WITH RESULT BECAME VILLAGE TALK ROSS BIT FIERCELY UPON AN
UNOFFENDING BATTER CAKE AND RESOLVED TO MAKE A CALL SINGLE HANDED
BEFORE HE LEFT THE HOUSE
THEY WENT OUT OF THE DINING ROOM THEIR HATS AS EVER PRESSED TO THEIR
BREASTS
WITH NO VOLITION OF THEIR OWN THEIR UNCERTAIN YOUNG LEGS
CARRIED THEM TO THE PORCH
THE CLAIBORNE FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD FOLLOWED
LIKE SMALL BOYS AFTER A CIRCUS PROCESSION
WHEN THE TWO TURNED AT
BAY YET WITH NOTHING BETWEEN THEM AND LIBERTY BUT A HYPNOTISM OF
THEIR OWN SUGGESTION THEY SAW THE BLACK FACES OF THE SERVANTS PEERING
OVER THE FAMILY SHOULDERS
ROSS WAS THE BOY TO HAVE DRAWN COURAGE FROM THE DESPERATION OF THEIR
CASE AND MADE SOME DECENT IF NOT GLORIOUS ENDING
BUT AT THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL MOMENT THERE CAME AROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE THAT
MOST CONTEMPTIBLE FIGURE KNOWN TO THE SOUTHERN PLANTATION A
SHIRT BOY A CREATURE WHO MAY BE DESCRIBED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE
NOT INFORMED AS A PICKANINNY CLAD ONLY IN A LONG COARSE COTTON
SHIRT
WHILE ALL EYES WERE FASTENED UPON HIM THIS INGLORIOUS
AMBASSADOR BOLTED FORTH HIS MESSAGE
YO' MA SAY HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON ABNER EF YO' DON' COME HOME
SHE GWINE COME AFTER YO' AN' CUT YO' INTO INCH PIECES WID A RAWHIDE
WHEN SHE GIT YO'
DAT JEST WHAT MISS HORTENSE SAY
AS THOUGH SUCH A BOOK AS HINTS AND HELPS HAD NEVER EXISTED ABNER
SHOT FOR THE GATE HE WAS BUT A HOBBLEDEHOY FASCINATED WITH THE IDEA
OF PLAYING GENTLEMAN
BUT IN ROSS THERE WERE THE MAKINGS OF A MAN
FOR
A FEW HALF HEARTED PACES UNDER THE FIRST IMPULSE OF HORROR HE
FOLLOWED HIS DESERTING CHIEF THE LAUGHTER OF THE FAMILY THE
UNRESTRAINABLE GUFFAWS OF THE NEGROES SOUNDING IN THE REAR
BUT WHEN
CHAMPE'S HIGH OFFENSIVE GIGGLE TOPPING ALL THE OTHERS INSULTED HIS
EARS HE STOPPED DEAD WHEELED AND RAN TO THE PORCH FASTER THAN HE
HAD FLED FROM IT
WHITE AS PAPER SHAKING WITH INEXPRESSIBLE RAGE HE
CAUGHT AND KISSED THE TITTERING GIRL VIOLENTLY NOISILY BEFORE THEM
ALL
THE NEGROES FLED THEY DARED NOT TRUST THEIR FEELINGS EVEN ALICIA
SNIGGERED UNOBTRUSIVELY GRANDFATHER CLAIBORNE CHUCKLED AND AUNT
MISSOURI FRANKLY COLLAPSED INTO HER ROCKING CHAIR BUBBLING WITH
MIRTH CRYING OUT
GOOD FOR YOU ROSS SEEMS YOU DID KNOW HOW TO CALL ON THE GIRLS
AFTER ALL
BUT ROSS PAYING NO ATTENTION WALKED SWIFTLY TOWARD THE GATE
HE HAD
SERVED HIS NOVITIATE
HE WOULD NEVER BE AFRAID AGAIN
WITH CHEERFUL
ALACRITY HE DODGED THE STONES FLUNG AFTER HIM WITH FRIENDLY ERRATIC
AIM BY THE GIRL UPON WHOM YESTERDAY AFTERNOON HE HAD COME TO MAKE A
SOCIAL CALL
HOW THE WIDOW WON THE DEACON
BY WILLIAM JAMES LAMPTON 1917
FROM HARPER'S BAZAAR APRIL 1911 COPYRIGHT 1911 BY HARPER
BROTHERS REPUBLISHED BY PERMISSION
OF COURSE THE WIDOW STIMSON NEVER TRIED TO WIN DEACON HAWKINS NOR ANY
OTHER MAN FOR THAT MATTER
A WIDOW DOESN'T HAVE TO TRY TO WIN A MAN
SHE WINS WITHOUT TRYING
STILL THE WIDOW STIMSON SOMETIMES WONDERED
WHY THE DEACON WAS SO BLIND AS NOT TO SEE HOW HER FINE FARM ADJOINING
HIS EQUALLY FINE PLACE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE TOWN MIGHT NOT BE
BROUGHT UNDER ONE MANAGEMENT WITH MUTUAL BENEFIT TO BOTH PARTIES AT
INTEREST
WHICH ONE THAT MANAGEMENT MIGHT BECOME WAS A MATTER OF
FUTURE DETAIL
THE WIDOW KNEW HOW TO RUN A FARM SUCCESSFULLY AND A
LARGE FARM IS NOT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RUN THAN ONE OF HALF THE
SIZE
SHE HAD ALSO HAD ONE HUSBAND AND KNEW SOMETHING MORE THAN
RUNNING A FARM SUCCESSFULLY
OF ALL OF WHICH THE DEACON WAS PERFECTLY
WELL AWARE AND STILL HE HAD NOT BEEN MOVED BY THE MERGING SPIRIT OF
THE AGE TO PROPOSE CONSOLIDATION
THIS INTERESTING SITUATION WAS UP FOR DISCUSSION AT THE WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON MEETING OF THE SISTERS' SEWING SOCIETY
FOR MY PART SISTER SUSAN SPICER WIFE OF THE METHODIST MINISTER
REMARKED AS SHE TOOK ANOTHER TUCK IN A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL'S SKIRT
FOR A TEN YEAR OLD FOR MY PART I CAN'T SEE WHY DEACON HAWKINS AND
KATE STIMSON DON'T SEE THE ERROR OF THEIR WAYS AND DEPART FROM THEM
I RATHER GUESS SHE HAS SMILED SISTER POTEET THE GROCER'S BETTER
HALF WHO HAD TAKEN AN AFTERNOON OFF FROM THE STORE IN ORDER TO BE
PRESENT
OR IS WILLING TO ADDED SISTER MARIA CARTRIDGE A SPINSTER STILL
POSSESSING FAITH HOPE AND CHARITY NOTWITHSTANDING SHE HAD BEEN ON
THE WAITING LIST A LONG TIME
REALLY NOW EXCLAIMED LITTLE SISTER GREEN THE DOCTOR'S WIFE DO
YOU THINK IT IS THE DEACON WHO NEEDS URGING
IT LOOKS THAT WAY TO ME SISTER POTEET DID NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM
WELL I HEARD SISTER CLARK SAY THAT SHE HAD HEARD HIM CALL HER
'KITTY' ONE NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE EATING ICE CREAM AT THE MITE
SOCIETY SISTER CANDISH THE DRUGGIST'S WIFE ADDED TO THE FUND OF
RELIABLE INFORMATION ON HAND
'KITTY INDEED PROTESTED SISTER SPICER
THE IDEA OF ANYBODY
CALLING KATE STIMSON 'KITTY' THE DEACON WILL TALK THAT WAY TO 'MOST
ANY WOMAN BUT IF SHE LET HIM SAY IT TO HER MORE THAN ONCE SHE MUST
BE GETTING MIGHTY ANXIOUS I THINK
OH SISTER CANDISH HASTENED TO EXPLAIN SISTER CLARK DIDN'T SAY SHE
HAD HEARD HIM SAY IT TWICE
WELL I DON'T THINK SHE HEARD HIM SAY IT ONCE SISTER SPICER
ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SISTER POTEET ARGUED
FROM ALL I CAN SEE
AND HEAR I THINK KATE STIMSON WOULDN'T OBJECT TO 'MOST ANYTHING THE
DEACON WOULD SAY TO HER KNOWING AS SHE DOES THAT HE AIN'T GOING TO
SAY ANYTHING HE SHOULDN'T SAY
AND ISN'T SAYING WHAT HE SHOULD ADDED SISTER GREEN WITH A SLY
SNICKER WHICH WENT AROUND THE ROOM SOFTLY
BUT AS I WAS SAYING SISTER SPICER BEGAN WHEN SISTER POTEET WHOSE
ROCKER NEAR THE WINDOW COMMANDED A VIEW OF THE FRONT GATE
INTERRUPTED WITH A WARNING 'SH 'SH
WHY SHOULDN'T I SAY WHAT I WANTED TO WHEN SISTER SPICER BEGAN
THERE SHE COMES NOW EXPLAINED SISTER POTEET AND AS I LIVE THE
DEACON DROVE HER HERE IN HIS SLEIGH AND HE'S WAITING WHILE SHE COMES
IN
I WONDER WHAT NEXT AND SISTER POTEET IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
ENTIRE SOCIETY GASPED AND HELD THEIR EAGER BREATHS AWAITING THE
ENTRANCE OF THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION
SISTER SPICER WENT TO THE FRONT DOOR TO LET HER IN AND SHE WAS
GREETED WITH THE GREATEST CORDIALITY BY EVERYBODY
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU AND WONDERING WHY YOU WERE SO LATE
COMING CRIED SISTER POTEET
NOW TAKE OFF YOUR THINGS AND MAKE UP
FOR LOST TIME
THERE'S A PAIR OF PANTS OVER THERE TO BE CUT DOWN TO
FIT THAT POOR LITTLE SNITHERS BOY
THE EXCITEMENT AND CURIOSITY OF THE SOCIETY WERE ALMOST MORE THAN
COULD BE BORNE BUT NEVER A SISTER LET ON THAT SHE KNEW THE DEACON WAS
AT THE GATE WAITING
INDEED AS FAR AS THE WIDOW COULD DISCOVER THERE
WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST INDICATION THAT ANYBODY HAD EVER HEARD THERE WAS
SUCH A PERSON AS THE DEACON IN EXISTENCE
OH SHE CHIRRUPED IN THE LIVELIEST OF HUMORS YOU WILL HAVE TO
EXCUSE ME FOR TODAY
DEACON HAWKINS OVERTOOK ME ON THE WAY HERE AND
HERE SAID I HAD SIMPLY GOT TO GO SLEIGH RIDING WITH HIM
HE'S WAITING
OUT AT THE GATE NOW
IS THAT SO EXCLAIMED THE SOCIETY UNANIMOUSLY AND RUSHED TO THE
WINDOW TO SEE IF IT WERE REALLY TRUE
WELL DID YOU EVER COMMENTED SISTER POTEET GENERALLY
HARDLY EVER LAUGHED THE WIDOW GOOD NATUREDLY AND I DON'T WANT TO
LOSE THE CHANCE
YOU KNOW DEACON HAWKINS ISN'T ASKING SOMEBODY EVERY
DAY TO GO SLEIGHING WITH HIM
I TOLD HIM I'D GO IF HE WOULD BRING ME
AROUND HERE TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF ME AND SO HE DID
NOW
GOOD BY AND I'LL BE SURE TO BE PRESENT AT THE NEXT MEETING
I HAVE TO
HURRY BECAUSE HE'LL GET FIDGETY
THE WIDOW RAN AWAY LIKE A LIVELY SCHOOLGIRL
ALL THE SISTERS WATCHED
HER GET INTO THE SLEIGH WITH THE DEACON AND RESUMED THE PREVIOUS
DISCUSSION WITH GREATLY INCREASED INTEREST
BUT LITTLE RECKED THE WIDOW AND LESS RECKED THE DEACON
HE HAD BOUGHT
A NEW HORSE AND HE WANTED THE WIDOW'S OPINION OF IT FOR THE WIDOW
STIMSON WAS A COMPETENT JUDGE OF FINE HORSEFLESH
IF DEACON HAWKINS
HAD ONE INSATIABLE AMBITION IT WAS TO OWN A HORSE WHICH COULD FLING
ITS HEELS IN THE FACE OF THE BEST THAT SQUIRE HOPKINS DROVE
IN HIS
EARLY MANHOOD THE DEACON WAS NO DEACON BY A GREAT DEAL
BUT AS THE
YEARS GATHERED IN BEHIND HIM HE PUT OFF MOST OF THE FRIVOLITIES OF
YOUTH AND HELD NOW ONLY TO THE ONE OF DRIVING A FAST HORSE
NO OTHER
MAN IN THE COUNTY DROVE ANYTHING FASTER EXCEPT SQUIRE HOPKINS AND HIM
THE DEACON HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO THROW THE DUST OVER
THE DEACON WOULD
GET GOOD ONES BUT SOMEHOW NEVER COULD HE FIND ONE THAT THE SQUIRE
DIDN'T GET A BETTER
THE SQUIRE HAD ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS BEATEN THE
DEACON IN THE RACE FOR A CERTAIN PRETTY GIRL HE DREAMED ABOUT
BUT THE
GIRL AND THE SQUIRE HAD LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND THE DEACON BEING
A PHILOSOPHER MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN THE SQUIRE'S SUPERIORITY HAD IT
BEEN MANIFESTED IN THIS ONE REGARD ONLY
BUT IN HORSES TOO THAT
GRAVELED THE DEACON
HOW MUCH DID YOU GIVE FOR HIM WAS THE WIDOW'S FIRST QUERY AFTER
THEY HAD REACHED A STRETCH OF ROAD THAT WAS GOOD GOING AND THE DEACON
HAD LET HIM OUT FOR A LENGTH OR TWO
WELL WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE YOU'RE A JUDGE
MORE THAN I WOULD GIVE I'LL BET A COOKIE
NOT IF YOU WAS AS ANXIOUS AS I AM TO SHOW HOPKINS THAT HE CAN'T DRIVE
BY EVERYTHING ON THE PIKE
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED A GOOD HORSE BECAUSE HE WAS A GOOD HORSE SAID
THE WIDOW RATHER DISAPPROVINGLY
I DO BUT I COULD LOVE HIM A GOOD DEAL HARDER IF HE WOULD STAY IN
FRONT OF HOPKINS'S BEST
DOES HE KNOW YOU'VE GOT THIS ONE
YES AND HE'S BEEN BLOWING ROUND TOWN THAT HE IS WAITING TO PICK ME
UP ON THE ROAD SOME DAY AND MAKE MY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS LOOK LIKE A
PEWTER QUARTER
SO YOU GAVE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR HIM DID YOU LAUGHED THE
WIDOW
IS IT TOO MUCH
UM ER HESITATED THE WIDOW GLANCING ALONG THE GRACEFUL LINES OF THE
POWERFUL TROTTER I SUPPOSE NOT IF YOU CAN BEAT THE SQUIRE
RIGHT YOU ARE CROWED THE DEACON AND I'LL SHOW HIM A THING OR TWO
IN GETTING OVER THE GROUND HE ADDED WITH SWELLING PRIDE
WELL I HOPE HE WON'T BE OUT LOOKING FOR YOU TODAY WITH ME IN YOUR
SLEIGH SAID THE WIDOW ALMOST APPREHENSIVELY BECAUSE YOU KNOW
DEACON I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED YOU TO BEAT SQUIRE HOPKINS
THE DEACON LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY
THERE WAS A SOFTNESS IN HER TONES
THAT APPEALED TO HIM EVEN IF SHE HAD NOT EXPRESSED SUCH AGREEABLE
SENTIMENTS
JUST WHAT THE DEACON MIGHT HAVE SAID OR DONE AFTER THE
IMPULSE HAD BEEN SET GOING MUST REMAIN UNKNOWN FOR AT THE CRUCIAL
MOMENT A SOUND OF MILITANT BELLS BELLS OF DEFIANCE JANGLED UP BEHIND
THEM DISTURBING THEIR PERSONAL ABSORPTION AND THEY LOOKED AROUND
SIMULTANEOUSLY
BEHIND THE BELLS WAS THE SQUIRE IN HIS SLEIGH DRAWN BY
HIS FASTEST STEPPER AND HE WAS ALONE AS THE DEACON WAS NOT
THE
WIDOW WEIGHED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY POUNDS NET WHICH IS WEIGHTING A
HORSE IN A RACE RATHER MORE THAN THE LAW ALLOWS
BUT THE DEACON NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
FORGETTING EVERYTHING EXCEPT HIS
CHERISHED AMBITION HE BRACED HIMSELF FOR THE CONTEST TOOK A TWIST
HOLD ON THE LINES SENT A SHARP QUICK CALL TO HIS HORSE AND LET HIM
OUT FOR ALL THAT WAS IN HIM
THE SQUIRE FOLLOWED SUIT AND THE DEACON
THE ROAD WAS WIDE AND THE SNOW WAS WORN DOWN SMOOTH
THE TRACK
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN BETTER CONDITION
THE HOPKINS COLORS WERE NOT
FIVE RODS BEHIND THE HAWKINS COLORS AS THEY GOT AWAY
FOR HALF A MILE
IT WAS NIP AND TUCK THE DEACON ENCOURAGING HIS HORSE AND THE WIDOW
ENCOURAGING THE DEACON AND THEN THE SQUIRE BEGAN CREEPING UP
THE
DEACON'S HORSE WAS A GOOD ONE BUT HE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO HAULING
FREIGHT IN A RACE
A HALF MILE OF IT WAS AS MUCH AS HE COULD STAND
AND HE WEAKENED UNDER THE STRAIN
NOT HANDICAPPED THE SQUIRE'S HORSE FORGED AHEAD AND AS HIS NOSE
PUSHED UP TO THE DASHBOARD OF THE DEACON'S SLEIGH THAT GOOD MAN
GROANED IN AGONIZED DISAPPOINTMENT AND BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT
THE WIDOW
WAS MAD ALL OVER THAT SQUIRE HOPKINS SHOULD TAKE SUCH A MEAN ADVANTAGE
OF HIS RIVAL
WHY DIDN'T HE WAIT TILL ANOTHER TIME WHEN THE DEACON WAS
ALONE AS HE WAS IF SHE HAD HER WAY SHE NEVER WOULD SPEAK TO SQUIRE
HOPKINS AGAIN NOR TO HIS WIFE EITHER
BUT HER RESENTMENT WAS NOT
HELPING THE DEACON'S HORSE TO WIN
SLOWLY THE SQUIRE PULLED CLOSER TO THE FRONT THE DEACON'S HORSE
REALIZING WHAT IT MEANT TO HIS MASTER AND TO HIM SPURTED BRAVELY
BUT STRUGGLE AS GAMELY AS HE MIGHT THE ODDS WERE TOO MANY FOR HIM
AND HE DROPPED TO THE REAR
THE SQUIRE SHOUTED IN TRIUMPH AS HE DREW
PAST THE DEACON AND THE DEJECTED HAWKINS SHRIVELLED INTO A HEAP ON
THE SEAT WITH ONLY HIS HANDS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO HOLD THE LINES
HE
HAD BEEN BEATEN AGAIN HUMILIATED BEFORE A WOMAN AND THAT TOO WITH
THE BEST HORSE THAT HE COULD HOPE TO PUT AGAINST THE EVER CONQUERING
SQUIRE
HERE SANK HIS FONDEST HOPES HERE ENDED HIS AMBITION
FROM
THIS ON HE WOULD DRIVE A MULE OR AN AUTOMOBILE
THE FRUIT OF HIS
DESIRE HAD TURNED TO ASHES IN HIS MOUTH
BUT NO
WHAT OF THE WIDOW SHE REALIZED IF THE DEACON DID NOT THAT
SHE NOT THE SQUIRE'S HORSE HAD BEATEN THE DEACON'S AND SHE WAS
READY TO MAKE WHAT ATONEMENT SHE COULD
AS THE SQUIRE PASSED AHEAD OF
THE DEACON SHE WAS STIRRED BY A NOBLE RESOLVE
A DEEP BED OF DRIFTED
SNOW LAY CLOSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD NOT FAR IN FRONT
IT WAS SOFT
AND SAFE AND SHE SMILED AS SHE LOOKED AT IT AS THOUGH WAITING FOR HER
WITHOUT A HINT OF HER PURPOSE OR A SIGN TO DISTURB THE DEACON IN HIS
FINAL THROES SHE ROSE AS THE SLEIGH RAN NEAR ITS EDGE AND WITH A
SPRING WHICH HAD MANY A TIME SENT HER LIGHTLY FROM THE GROUND TO THE
BARE BACK OF A HORSE IN THE MEADOW SHE CLEARED THE ROBES AND LIT
PLUMP IN THE DRIFT
THE DEACON'S HORSE KNEW BEFORE THE DEACON DID THAT
SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED IN HIS FAVOR AND WAS QUICK TO RESPOND
WITH
HIS FIRST JUMP OF RELIEF THE DEACON SUDDENLY REVIVED HIS HOPES CAME
FAST AGAIN HIS BLOOD RETINGLED HE GATHERED HIMSELF AND CRACKING
HIS LINES HE SHOT FORWARD AND THREE MINUTES LATER HE HAD PASSED THE
SQUIRE AS THOUGH HE WERE HITCHED TO THE FENCE
FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE
THE SQUIRE MADE HEROIC EFFORTS TO RECOVER HIS VANISHED PRESTIGE BUT
EFFORT WAS USELESS AND FINALLY CONCLUDING THAT HE WAS PRACTICALLY
LEFT STANDING HE VEERED OFF FROM THE MAIN ROAD DOWN A FARM LANE TO
FIND SOME SPOT IN WHICH TO HIDE THE HUMILIATION OF HIS DEFEAT
THE
DEACON STILL GOING AT A CLIPPING GAIT HAD ONE EYE OVER HIS SHOULDER
AS WARY DRIVERS ALWAYS HAVE ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND WHEN HE SAW THE
SQUIRE WAS OFF THE TRACK HE SLOWED DOWN AND JOGGED ALONG WITH THE
APPARENT INTENTION OF CONTINUING INDEFINITELY
PRESENTLY AN IDEA
STRUCK HIM AND HE LOOKED AROUND FOR THE WIDOW
SHE WAS NOT WHERE HE
HAD SEEN HER LAST
WHERE WAS SHE IN THE ENTHUSIASM OF VICTORY HE HAD
FORGOTTEN HER
HE WAS SO DEJECTED AT THE MOMENT SHE HAD LEAPED THAT HE
DID NOT REALIZE WHAT SHE HAD DONE AND TWO MINUTES LATER HE WAS SO
ELATED THAT SHAME ON HIM HE DID NOT CARE
WITH HER ALL WAS LOST
WITHOUT HER ALL WAS WON AND THE DEACON'S GREATEST AMBITION WAS TO
WIN
BUT NOW WITH VICTORY PERCHED ON HIS HORSE COLLAR SUCCESS HIS AT
LAST HE THOUGHT OF THE WIDOW AND HE DID CARE
HE CARED SO MUCH THAT
HE ALMOST THREW HIS HORSE OFF HIS FEET BY THE ABRUPT TURN HE GAVE HIM
AND BACK DOWN THE PIKE HE FLEW AS IF A LEGION OF SQUIRES WERE AFTER
HIM
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT INJURY SHE MIGHT HAVE SUSTAINED SHE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT IF NOT ACTUALLY KILLED
AND WHY SIMPLY TO MAKE
IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO WIN
THE DEACON SHIVERED AS HE THOUGHT OF IT
AND URGED HIS HORSE TO GREATER SPEED
THE SQUIRE DOWN THE LANE SAW
HIM WHIZZING ALONG AND ACCEPTED IT PROFANELY AS AN EXHIBITION FOR HIS
ESPECIAL BENEFIT
THE DEACON NOW HAD FORGOTTEN THE SQUIRE AS HE HAD
ONLY SO SHORTLY BEFORE FORGOTTEN THE WIDOW
TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE
DRIFT INTO WHICH SHE HAD JUMPED THERE WAS A TURN IN THE ROAD WHERE
SOME TREES SHUT OFF THE SIGHT AND THE DEACON'S ANXIETY INCREASED
MOMENTARILY UNTIL HE REACHED THIS POINT
FROM HERE HE COULD SEE AHEAD
AND DOWN THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD STOOD THE WIDOW WAVING HER
SHAWL AS A BANNER OF TRIUMPH THOUGH SHE COULD ONLY GUESS AT RESULTS
THE DEACON CAME ON WITH A RUSH AND PULLED UP ALONGSIDE OF HER IN A
CONDITION OF NERVOUSNESS HE DIDN'T THINK POSSIBLE TO HIM
HOORAY HOORAY SHOUTED THE WIDOW TOSSING HER SHAWL INTO THE AIR
YOU BEAT HIM
I KNOW YOU DID
DIDN'T YOU I SAW YOU PULLING AHEAD AT
THE TURN YONDER
WHERE IS HE AND HIS OLD PLUG
OH BOTHER TAKE HIM AND HIS HORSE AND THE RACE AND EVERYTHING
ARE
YOU HURT GASPED THE DEACON JUMPING OUT BUT MINDFUL TO KEEP THE
LINES IN HIS HAND
ARE YOU HURT HE REPEATED ANXIOUSLY THOUGH SHE
LOOKED ANYTHING BUT A HURT WOMAN
IF I AM SHE CHIRPED CHEERILY I'M NOT HURT HALF AS BAD AS I WOULD
HAVE BEEN IF THE SQUIRE HAD BEAT YOU DEACON
NOW DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT ME
LET'S HURRY BACK TO TOWN SO THE SQUIRE WON'T GET ANOTHER
CHANCE WITH NO PLACE FOR ME TO JUMP
AND THE DEACON WELL WELL WITH THE LINES IN THE CROOK OF HIS ELBOW
THE DEACON HELD OUT HIS ARMS TO THE WIDOW AND
THE SISTERS AT THE
NEXT MEETING OF THE SEWING SOCIETY WERE UNANIMOUSLY OF THE OPINION
THAT ANY WOMAN WHO WOULD RISK HER LIFE LIKE THAT FOR A HUSBAND WAS
MIGHTY ANXIOUS
GIDEON
BY WELLS HASTINGS 1878
FROM THE CENTURY MAGAZINE APRIL 1914 COPYRIGHT 1914 BY THE
CENTURY CO REPUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR'S PERMISSION
AN' DE NEXT' FRAWG DAT HOUN' PUP SEEN HE PASS HIM BY WIDE
THE HOUSE WHICH HAD HUNG UPON EVERY WORD ROARED WITH LAUGHTER AND
SHOOK WITH A STORMING VOLLEY OF APPLAUSE
GIDEON BOWED TO RIGHT AND TO
LEFT LOW GRINNING ASSURED COMEDY OBEISANCES BUT AS THE LAUGHTER
AND APPLAUSE GREW HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SIGNALED QUIETLY FOR THE
DROP
HE HAD ANSWERED MANY ENCORES AND HE WAS AN INSTINCTIVE ARTIST
IT WAS PART OF THE FUEL OF HIS VANITY THAT HIS AUDIENCE HAD NEVER YET
HAD ENOUGH OF HIM
DRAMATIC JUDGMENT AS WELL AS DRAMATIC SENSE OF
DELIVERY WAS NATIVE TO HIM QUALITIES WHICH THE SHREWD FELIX STUHK
HIS MANAGER AND EXULTANT DISCOVERER RECOGNIZED AND WISELY TRUSTED IN
OFF STAGE GIDEON WAS WATCHED OVER LIKE A CHILD AND A DELICATE
INVESTMENT BUT ONCE BEHIND THE FOOTLIGHTS HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO HIS
OWN TRIUMPHANT GAIT
IT WAS SMALL WONDER THAT STUHK DEEMED HIMSELF ONE OF THE CLEVEREST
MANAGERS IN THE BUSINESS THAT HIS NARROW BLUE SHAVEN FACE WAS
CONTINUALLY CHISELED IN SMILES OF COMPLACENT SELF CONGRATULATION
HE
WAS RAPIDLY BECOMING RICH AND THERE WERE BRIGHT PROSPECTS OF EVEN
GREATER TRIUMPHS WITH PROPORTIONATELY GREATER REWARD
HE HAD MADE
GIDEON A NATIONAL CHARACTER A HEADLINER A STAR OF THE FIRST
MAGNITUDE IN THE FIRMAMENT OF THE VAUDEVILLE THEATER AND ALL IN SIX
SHORT MONTHS
OR AT ANY RATE HE HAD HELPED TO MAKE HIM ALL THIS HE
HAD BOOKED HIM WELL AND GIVEN HIM HIS OPPORTUNITY
TO BE SURE GIDEON
HAD DONE THE REST STUHK WAS AS READY AS ANY ONE TO DO CREDIT TO
GIDEON'S ABILITY
STILL AFTER ALL HE STUHK WAS THE DISCOVERER THE
THEATRICAL COLUMBUS WHO HAD HAD THE COURAGE AND THE VISION
A NOW HALLOWED ATTACK OF TONSILITIS HAD DRIVEN HIM TO FLORIDA WHERE
PRESENTLY GIDEON HAD BEEN EMPLOYED TO BEGUILE HIS CONVALESCENCE AND
GUIDE HIM OVER THE INTRICATE SHALLOWS OF THAT LONG LAGOON KNOWN AS THE
INDIAN RIVER IN SEARCH OF VARIOUS FISH
ON DAYS WHEN FISH HAD BEEN
RELUCTANT GIDEON HAD BEEN LURED INTO CONVERSATION AND GRADUALLY INTO
NARRATIVE AND THE RELATION OF WHAT HAD APPEARED TO GIDEON AS HUMOROUS
AND ENTERTAINING AND FINALLY FELIX THE VAGUE IDEA GROWING BIG WITHIN
HIM HAD ONE DAY PERSUADED HIS BOATMAN TO DANCE UPON THE BOARDS OF A
LONG PIER WHERE THEY HAD MADE FAST FOR LUNCH
THERE WITH ALL THE
SUDDEN GLORY OF CRYSTALLIZATION THE VAGUE IDEA TOOK DEFINITE FORM AND
BECAME THE GREAT INSPIRATION OF STUHK'S CAREER
GIDEON HAD GROWN TO BE TO VAUDEVILLE MUCH WHAT UNCLE REMUS IS TO
LITERATURE THERE WAS VIRTUE IN HIS VERY SIMPLICITY
HIS ARTISTRY
ITSELF WAS NATIVE AND NATURAL
HE LOVED A GOOD STORY AND HE TOLD IT
FROM HIS OWN SENSE OF THE GLEEFUL MORSEL UPON HIS TONGUE AS NO
TRAINING COULD HAVE MADE HIM
HE ALWAYS ENJOYED HIS STORY AND HIMSELF
IN THE TELLING
TALES NEVER LOST THEIR SAVOR NO MATTER HOW OFTEN
REPEATED AGE WAS POWERLESS TO DIM THE HUMOR OF THE THING AND AS HE
HAD SHOUTED AND GURGLED AND LAUGHED OVER THE FUN OF THINGS WHEN ALL
ALONE OR HOLDING FORTH AMONG THE MEN AND WOMEN AND LITTLE CHILDREN OF
HIS COLOR SO HE SHOUTED AND GURGLED AND BROKE FROM SONOROUS CHUCKLES
TO MUSICAL FALSETTO MIRTH WHEN HE FRONTED THE SWEEPING TIERS OF FACES
ACROSS THE INTOXICATING GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS
HE HAD THAT RARE
POWER OF TRANSMITTING SOMETHING OF HIS OWN ENJOYMENTS
WHEN GIDEON WAS
ON THE STAGE STUHK USED TO ENJOY PEEPING OUT AT THE INTENT SMILING
FACES OF THE AUDIENCE WHERE MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN HARDENED
THEATER GOERS AND FOLK FRESH FROM THE COUNTRY SAT WITH MOVING LIPS
AND FACES LIT WITH AN EAGER INTEREST AND SYMPATHY FOR THE BLACK MAN
STRUTTING IN LOOSE FOOTED VIVACITY BEFORE THEM
HE'S SIMPLY UNIQUE HE BOASTED TO WONDERING LOCAL MANAGERS UNIQUE
AND IT TOOK ME TO FIND HIM
THERE HE WAS A LITTLE BLACK GOLD MINE
AND ALL OF 'EM PASSED HIM BY UNTIL I CAME
SOME EYE WHAT I GUESS
YOU'LL ADMIT YOU HAVE TO HAND IT SOME TO YOUR UNCLE FELIX
IF THAT
COON'S HEALTH HOLDS OUT WE'LL HAVE ALL THE MONEY THERE IS IN THE
MINT
THAT WAS FELIX'S REAL ANXIETY IF HIS HEALTH HOLDS OUT GIDEON'S
HEALTH WAS WATCHED OVER AS IF HE HAD BEEN AN AILING PRINCE
HIS
BUBBLING VIVACITY WAS THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH HIS CHARM AND HIS
SUCCESS WERE BUILT
STUHK BECAME A SORT OF VICARIOUS NEUROTIC
ETERNALLY SEARCHING FOR SYMPTOMS IN HIS PROTG GIDEON'S TONGUE
GIDEON'S LIVER GIDEON'S HEART WERE MATTERS TO HIM OF AN UNFAILING
AND ANXIOUS INTEREST
AND OF LATE OF COURSE IT MIGHT BE IMAGINATION
GIDEON HAD SHOWN A LITTLE PHYSICAL FALLING OFF
HE ATE A BIT LESS
HE HAD BEGUN TO MOVE IN A RESTLESS WAY AND WORST OF ALL HE LAUGHED
LESS FREQUENTLY
AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WAS GROUND FOR STUHK'S APPREHENSION
IT WAS
NOT ALL A MATTER OF MANAGERIAL IMAGINATION GIDEON WAS LESS HIMSELF
PHYSICALLY THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIM HE COULD HAVE PASSED
HIS RIGID INSURANCE SCRUTINY AS EASILY AS HE HAD DONE MONTHS BEFORE
WHEN HIS LIFE AND HEALTH HAD BEEN INSURED FOR A SUM THAT MADE GOOD
COPY FOR HIS PRESS AGENT
HE WAS SOUND IN EVERY ORGAN BUT THERE WAS
SOMETHING LACKING IN GENERAL TONE
GIDEON FELT IT HIMSELF AND WAS
CERTAIN THAT A MISERY THAT EMBRACING INDISPOSITION OF HIS RACE WAS
CREEPING UPON HIM
HE HAD BEEN FED WELL TOO WELL HE WAS GROWING
RICH TOO RICH HE HAD ALL THE PRAISE ALL THE FLATTERY THAT HIS
ENORMOUS APPETITE FOR APPROVAL DESIRED AND TOO MUCH OF IT
WHITE MEN
SOUGHT HIM OUT AND MADE MUCH OF HIM WHITE WOMEN TALKED TO HIM ABOUT
HIS CAREER AND WHEREVER HE WENT WOMEN OF COLOR BLACK GIRLS BROWN
GIRLS YELLOW GIRLS WROTE HIM OF THEIR ADMIRATION WHISPERED WHEN HE
WOULD LISTEN OF THEIR PASSION AND HERO WORSHIP
CITY NIGGERS BOWED
DOWN BEFORE HIM THE HIGH GALLERY WAS ALWAYS PACKED WITH THEM
MUSK SCENTED NOTES SCRAWLED UPON BARBARIC HIGH TONED STATIONERY
POURED IN UPON HIM
EVEN A FEW WHITE WOMEN TO HIS HORROR AND
EMBARRASSMENT HAD WRITTEN HIM OF LOVE LETTERS WHICH HE STRAIGHTWAY
DESTROYED
HIS SENSE OF HIS POSITION WAS STRONG IN HIM HE WAS PROUD
OF IT
THERE MIGHT BE FOLKS OUTER THEIR HAIDS BUT HE HAD THE SENSE
TO REMEMBER
FOR MONTHS HE HAD LIVED IN A HEAVEN OF GRATIFIED VANITY
BUT AT LAST HIS APPETITE HAD BEGUN TO FALTER
HE WAS SATED HIS SOUL
LONGED TO WIPE A SPIRITUAL MOUTH ON THE BACK OF A SPIRITUAL HAND AND
HAVE DONE
HIS FACE NOW THAT THE CURTAIN WAS DOWN AND HE WAS LEAVING
THE STAGE WAS DOLEFUL ALMOST SULLEN
STUHK MET HIM ANXIOUSLY IN THE WINGS AND WALKED WITH HIM TO HIS
DRESSING ROOM
HE FELT SUDDENLY VERY WEARY OF STUHK
NOTHING THE MATTER GIDEON IS THERE NOT FEELING SICK OR ANYTHING
NO MISTEH STUHK NO SEH
JES DON' FEEL EXTRY PERT THAT'S ALL
BUT WHAT IS IT ANYTHING BOTHERING YOU
GIDEON SAT GLOOMILY BEFORE HIS MIRROR
MISTEH STUHK HE SAID AT LAST I BEEN STEDDYIN' IT OVEH AND I
ABOUT COME TO THE DELUSION THAT I NEEDS A GOOD PO'K CHOP
SEEMS
FOOLISH I KNOW BUT IT DO' SEEM AS IF A GOOD PO'K CHOP FRIED JES
RIGHT WOULD HE'P CONSID'ABLE TO DISUMPATE THIS MISERY FEELIN' THAT'S
CRAWLIN' AND CREEPIN' ROUND MY SPERIT
STUHK LAUGHED
PORK CHOP EH IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN THINK OF I KNOW WHAT YOU
MEAN THOUGH
I'VE THOUGHT FOR SOME TIME THAT YOU WERE GETTING A
LITTLE OVERTRAINED
WHAT YOU NEED IS LET ME SEE YES A NICE BOTTLE
OF WINE
THAT'S THE TICKET IT WILL EASE THINGS UP AND WON'T DO YOU
ANY HARM
I'LL GO WITH YOU
EVER HAD ANY CHAMPAGNE GIDEON
GIDEON STRUGGLED FOR POLITENESS
YES SEH I'S HAD CHAMPAGNE AND IT'S A NICE KIND OF LICKEH SHO
ENOUGH BUT MISTEH STUHK SEH I DON' WANT ANY OF THEM HIGH TONE
DRINKS TO NIGHT AN' EF YO' DON' MIND I'D RATHER AMBLE OFF 'LONE OR
MEBBE EAT THAT PO'K CHOP WITH SOME OTHEH CULLUD MAN EF I KIN FIN' ONE
THAT AIN' ONE OF THEM NO 'COUNT CAROLINA NIGGERS
DO YOU S'POSE YO'
COULD LET ME HAVE A LITTLE MONEY TO NIGHT MISTEH STUHK
STUHK THOUGHT RAPIDLY
GIDEON HAD CERTAINLY WORKED HARD AND HE WAS
NOT DISSIPATED
IF HE WANTED TO ROAM THE TOWN BY HIMSELF THERE WAS NO
HARM IN IT
THE SULLENNESS STILL SHOWED IN THE BLACK FACE HEAVEN KNEW
WHAT HE MIGHT DO IF HE SUDDENLY BEGAN TO BALK
STUHK THOUGHT IT WISE
TO CONSENT GRACEFULLY
GOOD HE SAID
FLY TO IT
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT
A HUNDRED
HOW MUCH IS COMING TO ME
ABOUT A THOUSAND GIDEON
WELL I'D MOUGHTY LIKE FIVE HUN'RED OF IT EF THAT'S 'GREEABLE TO
YO'
FELIX WHISTLED
FIVE HUNDRED PORK CHOPS MUST BE COMING HIGH
YOU DON'T WANT TO CARRY
ALL THAT MONEY AROUND DO YOU
GIDEON DID NOT ANSWER HE LOOKED VERY GLOOMY
STUHK HASTENED TO CHEER HIM
OF COURSE YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT
WAIT A MINUTE AND I WILL
GET IT FOR YOU
I'LL BET THAT COON'S GOING TO BUY HIMSELF A RING OR SOMETHING HE
REFLECTED AS HE WENT IN SEARCH OF THE LOCAL MANAGER AND GIDEON'S
MONEY
BUT STUHK WAS WRONG
GIDEON HAD NO INTENTION OF BUYING HIMSELF A RING
FOR THE MATTER OF THAT HE HAD SEVERAL THAT WERE AMPLY SATISFACTORY
THEY HAD SIZE AND SPARKLE AND LUSTER ALL THE DIAMOND BRILLIANCE THAT
RINGS NEED TO HAVE AND FOR NONE OF THEM HAD HE PAID MUCH OVER FIVE
DOLLARS
HE WAS AMPLY SUPPLIED WITH JEWELRY IN WHICH HE FELT PERFECT
SATISFACTION
HIS PRESENT WANT WAS POSITIVE IF NEBULOUS HE DESIRED A
FORTUNE IN HIS POCKET BULKY TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OF HIS MIRACULOUS
SUCCESS
EVER SINCE STUHK HAD FOUND HIM LIFE HAD HAD AN UNREAL
QUALITY FOR HIM
HIS MONTE CRISTO WEALTH WAS TOO MUCH LIKE A FABULOUS
DREAM FOUND TREASURE MONEY THAT COULD NOT BE SPENT WITHOUT DANGER OF
AWAKENING
AND HE HAD DROPPED INTO THE HABIT OF STORING IT ABOUT HIM
SO THAT IN ANY POCKET INTO WHICH HE PLUNGED HIS HAND HE MIGHT FIND A
ROLL OF CRISP EVIDENCE OF REALITY
HE LIKED HIS BILLS TO BE OF ALL
DENOMINATIONS AND SOME SO LARGE AS EXQUISITELY TO STAGGER
IMAGINATION OTHERS CHARMING BY THEIR NUMBER AND CRISPNESS THE
DIGNIFIED ORANGE PAPER OF A MAN OF ASSURED POSITION AND
WEALTH CRACKLING GREENBACKS THE DESIGN OF WHICH TINGED THE WHOLE WITH
ACTUALITY
HE WAS SPECIALLY PARTIAL TO ENGRAVINGS OF PRESIDENT
LINCOLN THE PARTICULAR SAVIOR AND PATRON OF HIS RACE
THIS FIVE
HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WAS ADDING TO AN UNRECKONED SUM OF ABOUT TWO
THOUSAND MERELY AS EXTRA FORTIFICATION AGAINST A GROWING SENSE OF
GLOOM
HE WISHED TO BRACE HIS FLAGGING SPIRITS WITH THE GAY WINE OF
POSSESSION AND HE WAS GLAD WHEN THE MONEY CAME THAT IT WAS IN AN
ELASTIC BOUND ROLL SO BULKY THAT IT WAS PLEASANTLY UNCOMFORTABLE IN
HIS POCKET AS HE LEFT HIS MANAGER
AS HE TURNED INTO THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED STREET FROM THE SOMBER
ALLEYWAY OF THE STAGE ENTRANCE HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT TO GLANCE AT
HIS OWN NAME IN THREE FOOT LETTERS OF RED BEFORE THE DOORS OF THE
THEATER
HE COULD READ AND THE LARGE BLOCK TYPE ALWAYS PLEASED HIM
THIS WEEK GIDEON THAT WAS ALL
NONE OF THE FULSOME PRAISE THE
SUPERLATIVE NECESSARY DEFINITION GIVEN TO LESSER PERFORMERS
HE HAD
BEEN HE REMEMBERED GIDEON AMERICA'S FOREMOST NATIVE COMEDIAN A
TITLE THAT WAS AT ONCE BOAST AND CHALLENGE
THAT NECESSITY WAS NOW
PAST FOR HE WAS A NATIONAL CHARACTER ANY EXPLANATORY QUALIFICATION
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN INSULT TO THE PUBLIC INTELLIGENCE
TO THE WORLD HE
WAS JUST GIDEON THAT WAS ENOUGH
IT GAVE HIM PLEASURE AS HE
SAUNTERED ALONG TO SEE THE ANNOUNCEMENT REPEATED ON WINDOW CARDS AND
HOARDINGS
PRESENTLY HE CAME TO A WINDOW BEFORE WHICH HE PAUSED IN DELIGHTED
WONDER
IT WAS NOT A LARGE WINDOW TO THE CASUAL EYE OF THE PASSER BY
THERE WAS LITTLE TO DRAW ATTENTION
BY DAY IT LIGHTED THE FRACTIONAL
FLOOR SPACE OF A LITTLE STATIONER WHO SUPPLEMENTED A SLIM BUSINESS BY
A SUB AGENCY FOR RAILROAD AND STEAMSHIP LINES BUT TO NIGHT THIS
WINDOW SEEMED THE FRAMEWORK OF A MARVEL OF COINCIDENCE
ON THE BROAD
DUSTY SILL INSIDE WERE PROPPED TWO CARDS THE ONE ON THE LEFT WAS HIS
OWN RED LETTERED ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE WEEK THE ONE AT THE RIGHT OH
WORLD OF WONDERS WAS A PHOTOGRAVURE OF THAT EXACT STRETCH OF THE
INNER COAST OF FLORIDA WHICH GIDEON KNEW BEST WHICH WAS HOME
THERE IT WAS THE INDIAN RIVER RIPPLING IDLY IN FULL SUNLIGHT
PALMETTOS LEANING OVER THE WATER PALMETTOS STANDING AS IRREGULAR
SENTRIES ALONG THE LOW REEFLIKE ISLAND WHICH STRETCHED AWAY OUT OF
THE PICTURE
THERE WAS THE GIGANTIC LONELY PINE HE KNEW WELL AND
YES HE COULD JUST MAKE IT OUT THERE WAS HIS OWN RAMSHACKLE LITTLE
PIER WHICH STRETCHED IN UNDULATING FASHION LIKE A LONG LEGGED
WADING CATERPILLAR FROM THE ABRUPT SHORE LINE OF ERODED COQUINA INTO
DEEP WATER
HE THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THIS PICTURE OF HIS HOME WAS SOME NEW AND
DELICATE DEVICE PUT FORTH BY HIS PRESS AGENT
HIS NAME ON ONE SIDE OF
A WINDOW HIS BIRTHPLACE UPON THE OTHER WHAT COULD BE MORE TASTEFULLY
APPROPRIATE THEREFORE AS HE SPELLED OUT THE READING MATTER BENEATH
THE PHOTOGRAVURE HE WAS SHARPLY DISAPPOINTED
IT READ
SPEND THIS WINTER IN BALMY FLORIDA
COME TO THE LAND OF PERPETUAL SUNSHINE
GOLF TENNIS DRIVING SHOOTING BOATING FISHING ALL OF THE BEST
THERE WAS MORE BUT HE HAD NO HEART FOR IT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND
PUZZLED
THIS PICTURE HAD AFTER ALL NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
IT WAS A
CHANCE AND YET WHAT A STRANGE CHANCE IT TROUBLED AND UPSET HIM
HIS
BLACK ROUND FEATURED FACE TOOK ON DEEP WRINKLES OF PERPLEXITY
THE
MISERY WHICH HAD HUNG DARKLY ON HIS HORIZON FOR WEEKS ENGULFED HIM
WITHOUT WARNING
BUT IN THE VERY BITTERNESS OF HIS MELANCHOLY HE KNEW
AT LAST HIS DISEASE
IT WAS NOT CHAMPAGNE OR RECREATION THAT HE
NEEDED NOT EVEN A PO'K CHOP ALTHOUGH HIS DESIRE FOR IT HAD BEEN A
SYMPTOM A GROPING FOR A TOO HOMEOPATHIC REMEDY HE WAS HOMESICK
EASY CHILDISH TEARS CAME INTO HIS EYES AND RAN OVER HIS SHINING
CHEEKS
HE SHIVERED FORLORNLY WITH A SUDDEN SENSE OF COLD AND
ABSENTLY CLUTCHED AT THE LAPELS OF HIS GORGEOUS FUR LINED ULSTER
THEN IN ABRUPT REACTION HE LAUGHED ALOUD SO THAT THE SHRILL MUSICAL
FALSETTO STARTLED THE PASSERS BY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A LITTLE
SEMICIRCLE OF THE CURIOUS WATCHED SPELLBOUND AS A BLACK MAN
EXQUISITELY APPARELED DANCED IN WILD LOOSE GRACE BEFORE THE DULL
BACKGROUND OF A SOMEWHAT GRIMY AND APPARENTLY VACANT WINDOW
A NEWSBOY
RECOGNIZED HIM
HE HEARD HIS NAME BEING PASSED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH AND CAME PARTLY TO
HIS SENSES
HE STOPPED DANCING AND GRINNED AT THEM
SAY YOU ARE GIDEON AIN'T YOU HIS DISCOVERER DEMANDED WITH A SORT
OF REVERENT AUDACITY
YAAS SEH SAID GIDEON THAT'S ME
YO' SHU GOT IT RIGHT HE
BROKE INTO A JOYOUS PEAL OF LAUGHTER THE LAUGHTER THAT HAD MADE HIM
FAMOUS AND BOWED DEEPLY BEFORE HIM
GIDEON POSI TIVE LY HIS LAS'
PUFFAWMUNCE TURNING HE DASHED FOR A PASSING TROLLEY AND STILL
LAUGHING SWUNG ABOARD
HE WAS NATURALLY HONEST
IN A LAND OF EASY MORALITY HIS FRIENDS HAD
ACCOUNTED HIM SOMETHING OF A PARAGON NOR HAD STUHK EVER HAD ANYTHING
BUT PRAISE FOR HIM
BUT NOW HE CRUSHED ASIDE THE ETHICS OF HIS INTENT
WITHOUT A SINGLE TROUBLED THOUGHT
RUNNING AWAY HAS ALWAYS BEEN
INHERENT IN THE NEGRO
HE GAVE ONE REGRETFUL THOUGHT TO THE GORGEOUS
WARDROBE HE WAS LEAVING BEHIND HIM BUT HE DARED NOT RETURN FOR IT
STUHK MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT INTO HIS HEAD TO GO BACK TO THEIR ROOMS
HE
MUST CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REFLECTION THAT HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT
WEARING HIS BEST
THE TROLLEY SEEMED TOO SLOW FOR HIM AND AS ALWAYS HAPPENED NOWADAYS
HE WAS RECOGNIZED HE HEARD HIS NAME WHISPERED AND WAS AWARE OF THE
ADMIRING GLANCES OF THE CURIOUS
EVEN POPULARITY HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
HE
GOT DOWN IN FRONT OF A BIG HOTEL AND CHOSE A TAXICAB FROM THE WAITING
RANK EXHORTING THE DRIVER TO MAKE HIS BEST SPEED TO THE STATION
LEANING BACK IN THE SOFT DEPTHS OF THE CAB HE SAVORED HIS
INDEPENDENCE CHEERED ALREADY BY THE SWAYING LURCHING SPEED
AT THE
STATION HE TIPPED THE DRIVER IN LORDLY FASHION VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH
HIMSELF AND ANXIOUS TO GIVE PLEASURE
ONLY THE STERNEST PRUDENCE AND
AN UNCONQUERABLE AWE OF UNIFORM HAD KEPT HIM FROM TOSSING BILLS TO THE
VARIOUS TRAFFIC POLICEMEN WHO HAD SEEMED TO SMILE UPON HIS HURRY
NO THROUGH TRAIN LEFT FOR HOURS BUT AFTER THE FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT OF
MOMENTARY CHECK HE DECIDED THAT HE WAS MORE PLEASED THAN OTHERWISE
IT WOULD SAVE EMBARRASSMENT
HE WAS GOING SOUTH WHERE HIS COLOR WOULD
BE MORE CONSIDERED THAN HIS REPUTATION AND ON THE LITTLE LOCAL HE
CHOSE THERE WAS A JIM CROW CAR ONE THAT IS SPECIALLY SET ASIDE
FOR THOSE OF HIS RACE
THAT IT PROVED CROWDED AND FULL OF SMOKE DID
NOT TROUBLE HIM AT ALL NOR DID THE ADMIRING PLEASANTRIES WHICH THE
SPLENDOR OF HIS APPAREL IMMEDIATELY CALLED FORTH
NO ONE KNEW HIM
INDEED HE WAS NATURALLY ENOUGH MISTAKEN FOR A PROSPEROUS GAMBLER A
NOT UNFLATTERING SUPPOSITION
IN THE YARD AFTER THE TRAIN PULLED OUT
HE SAW HIS PRIVATE CAR UNDER A GLARING ARC LIGHT AND GRINNED TO SEE
IT LEFT BEHIND
HE SPENT THE NIGHT PLEASANTLY IN A NOISY GAME OF HIGH LOW JACK AND
THE NEXT MORNING SLEPT MORE SOUNDLY THAN HE HAD SLEPT FOR WEEKS
HUNCHED UPON A WOODEN BENCH IN THE BOXLIKE STATION OF A NORTH CAROLINA
JUNCTION
THE EXPRESS WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO JACKSONVILLE IN
TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE JOURNEY AS HE TOOK IT BOARDING ANY LOCAL THAT
HAPPENED TO BE GOING SOUTH AND LEAVING IT FOR MEALS OR SOMETIMES FOR
SLEEP OR OFTEN AS THE WHIM POSSESSED HIM FILLED FIVE HAPPY DAYS
THERE HE TOOK A NIGHT TRAIN AND DOZED FROM JACKSONVILLE UNTIL A
LITTLE NORTH OF NEW SMYRNA
HE AWOKE TO FIND IT BROAD DAYLIGHT AND THE CAR HALF EMPTY
THE TRAIN
WAS ON A SIDING WITH NEWS OF A FREIGHT WRECK AHEAD
GIDEON STRETCHED
HIMSELF AND LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND EMOTION SEIZED HIM
FOR ALL
HIS JOURNEY THE SOUTH HAD SEEMED TO WELCOME HIM BUT HERE AT LAST WAS
THE COUNTRY HE KNEW
HE WENT OUT UPON THE PLATFORM AND THREW BACK HIS
HEAD SNIFFING THE SOFT BREEZE HEAVY WITH THE MYSTERIOUS THRILL OF
UNPLOWED ACRES THE WONDROUS EXISTENCE OF PRIMORDIAL JUNGLE WHERE
LIFE HAS RIOTED UNCEASINGLY ABOVE UNCEASING DECAY
IT WAS DRY WITH THE
FINE DUST OF WASTE PLACES AND WET WITH THE WARM MISTS OF SLUMBERING
SWAMPS IT SEEMED TO GIDEON TO TREMBLE WITH THE SONGS OF BIRDS THE
DRY MURMUR OF PALM LEAVES AND THE ALMOST INAUDIBLE WHISPER OF THE
GRAY MOSS THAT FESTOONED THE LIVE OAKS
UM M M HE MURMURED APOSTROPHIZING IT YO' 'S THE RIGHT KIND O'
BREEZE YO' IS
YO' ALL'S HEALTHY STILL SNIFFING HE CLIMBED DOWN TO
THE DUSTY ROAD BED
THE NEGROES WHO HAD RIDDEN WITH HIM WERE SPRAWLED ABOUT HIM ON THE
GROUND ONE OF THEM LAY SLEEPING FACE UP IN THE SUNLIGHT
THE TRAIN
HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME AND THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF AN
IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE
HE BOUGHT SOME ORANGES OF A LITTLE BOWLEGGED
BLACK BOY AND SAT DOWN ON A LOG TO EAT THEM AND TO GIVE UP HIS MIND
TO ENJOYMENT
THE SUN WAS HOT UPON HIM AND HIS THOUGHTS WERE VAGUE
AND DROWSY
HE WAS GLAD THAT HE WAS ALIVE GLAD TO BE BACK ONCE MORE
AMONG FAMILIAR SCENES
DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE TRAIN HE SAW WHITE
PASSENGERS FROM THE PULLMANS RESTLESSLY PACING UP AND DOWN GETTING
INTO THEIR CARS AND OUT OF THEM CONSULTING WATCHES ATTACHING
THEMSELVES WITH GESTICULATORY EXPOSTULATION TO VARIOUS OFFICIALS BUT
THEIR IMPATIENCE FOUND NO ECHO IN HIS THOUGHT
WHAT WAS THE HURRY
THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME
IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO HAVE COME TO HIS OWN
LAND THE ACTUAL WALLS OF HOME COULD WAIT
THE DELAY WAS PLEASANT
WITH ITS OPPORTUNITY FOR DROWSY SUNNING ITS RELIEF FROM THE GRIMY
MONOTONY OF TRAVEL
HE GLANCED AT THE ORANGE COLORED JIM CROW WITH
DISTASTE AND INSPIRATION DAWNING SLOWLY UPON HIM SWEPT ALL OTHER
THOUGHT BEFORE IT IN ITS GREAT AND GROWING GLORY
A BRAKEMAN PASSED AND GIDEON LEAPED TO HIS FEET AND PURSUED HIM
MISTEH HOW LONG YO' ALL RECKON THIS TRAIN GOIN' TO BE
ABOUT AN HOUR
THE QUESTION HAD BEEN A MERE MATTER OF FORM
GIDEON HAD MADE UP HIS
MIND AND IF HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THEY STARTED IN FIVE MINUTES HE
WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED IT
HE CLIMBED BACK INTO THE CAR FOR HIS COAT
AND HIS HAT AND THEN ALMOST FURTIVELY STOLE DOWN THE STEPS AGAIN AND
SLIPPED QUIETLY INTO THE PALMETTO SCRUB
'MOST MADE THE MISTAKE OF MA LIFE HE CHUCKLED STICKIN' TO THAT
OL' TRAIN FOHEVEH
'T ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY AT ALL FOH GIDEON TO COME
HOME
THE RIVER WAS NOT FAR AWAY
HE COULD CATCH THE DANCING BLUE OF IT FROM
TIME TO TIME IN RAGGED VISTA AND FOR THIS BEACON HE STEERED DIRECTLY
HIS COAT WAS HEAVY ON HIS ARM HIS THIN PATENT LEATHER TIES PINCHED
AND BURNED AND DEMANDED DETOURS AROUND SWAMPY PLACES BUT HE WAS
HAPPY
AS HE WENT ALONG HIS PLAN PERFECTED ITSELF
HE WOULD GET INTO LOOSE
SHOES AGAIN OLD ONES IF MONEY COULD BUY THEM AND OLD CLOTHES TOO
THE BULL BRIERS SNATCHING AT HIS TAILORED SPLENDOR SUGGESTED THAT
HE LAUGHED WHEN THE FLORIDA PARTRIDGE A SMALL QUAIL WHIRRED UP FROM
UNDER HIS FEET HE PAUSED TO EXCHANGE AFFECTIONATE MOCKERY WITH RED
SQUIRRELS AND ONCE EVEN WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT UP SUDDENLY TO A
FAMILIAR AND OMINOUS DRY REVERBERATION THE SMALL CRISP SOUND OF THE
ROLLING DRUMS OF DEATH HE DID NOT LOOK ABOUT HIM FOR SOME INSTRUMENT
OF DESTRUCTION AS AT ANY OTHER TIME HE WOULD HAVE DONE BUT INSTEAD
PEERED CAUTIOUSLY OVER THE LOG BEFORE HIM AND SPOKE IN TOLERANT
ADMONITION
NOW MISTEH RATTLESNAKE YO' JES MIN' YO' OWN BUSINESS
NOBODY'S
GOIN' STEP ON YO' NER GO TRIFLIN' ROUN' YO' IN NO WAY WHATSOMEVEH
YO' JES LAY THERE IN THE SUN AN' GIT 'S FAT 'S YO' PLEASE
DON' YO'
TU'N YO' WEEKED LI'L' EYES ON GIDEON
HE'S JES GOIN' 'LONG HOME AN'
AIN' LOOKIN' FOH NO MUSS
HE CAME PRESENTLY TO THE WATER AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT TO A
LITTLE GROUP OF NEGRO CABINS WHERE HE WAS ABLE TO BUY OLD CLOTHES
AND AFTER MUCH DICKERING A LONG AND SOMEWHAT LEAKY ROWBOAT RIGGED
OUT WITH A TATTERED LEG OF MUTTON SAIL
THIS HE PROVISIONED WITH A JUG
OF WATER A STARCH BOX FULL OF WHITE CORN MEAL AND A WIDE STRIP OF
LEAN RAZORBACK BACON
AS HE PUSHED OUT FROM SHORE AND SET HIS SAIL TO THE SMALL BREEZE THAT
BLEW DOWN FROM THE NORTH AN ABSOLUTE CONTENTMENT POSSESSED HIM
THE
IDLE WATERS OF THE LAGOON LYING WITHOUT TIDE OR CURRENT IN ETERNAL
INDOLENCE RIPPLED AND SPARKLED IN BREEZE AND SUNLIGHT WITH A MERRY
SURFACE ACTIVITY AND SEEMED TO LAP THE LEAKY LITTLE BOAT MORE SWIFTLY
ON ITS WAY
MOSQUITO INLET OPENED BROADLY BEFORE HIM AND SKIRTING THE
END OF MERRITT'S ISLAND HE CAME AT LAST INTO THAT LONGEST LAGOON WITH
WHICH HE WAS MOST FAMILIAR THE INDIAN RIVER
HERE THE WIND DIED DOWN
TO A MERE BREATH WHICH BARELY KEPT HIS BOAT IN MOTION BUT HE MADE NO
ATTEMPT TO ROW
AS LONG AS HE MOVED AT ALL HE WAS SATISFIED
HE WAS
LIVING THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DREAMS IN EXILE LOUNGING IN THE STERN IN
THE ANCIENT CLOTHES HE HAD PURCHASED HIS FEET STRETCHED COMFORTABLY
BEFORE HIM IN THEIR BROKEN SHOES ONE FOOT UPON A THWART THE OTHER
HANGING OVERSIDE SO LAXLY THAT OCCASIONAL RIPPLES LAPPED THE RUN OVER
HEEL
FROM TIME TO TIME HE SCANNED SHORE AND RIVER FOR FAMILIAR POINTS
OF INTEREST SOME REMEMBERED SNAG THAT SHOWED THE TIP OF ONE GNARLED
BRANCH
OR HE MARKED A NEWLY FALLEN PALMETTO ALREADY ROTTING IN THE
WATER WHICH MUST BE ADDED TO THAT MAP OF VAST DETAIL THAT HE CARRIED
IN HIS HEAD
BUT FOR THE MOST PART HIS BROAD BLACK FACE WAS TURNED UP
TO THE BLUE BRILLIANCE ABOVE HIM IN UNBLINKING CONTEMPLATION HIS KEEN
EYES BRILLIANT DESPITE THEIR SUN MUDDIED WHITES REVELED IN THE
HEIGHTS ABOVE HIM SWINGING FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON IN THE WAKE OF AN
ORDERLY FILE OF LITTLE BLUEBILL DUCKS WINGING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE
RIVER OR BRIGHTENING WITH INTEREST AT THE RARER SIGHT OF A PAIR OF
MALLARDS OR REDHEADS LIFTING WITH THE SOARING CIRCLES OF THE GREAT
BALD HEADED EAGLE OR FOLLOWING THE SCATTERED SQUADRON OF HERON WHITE
HERON BLUE HERON YOUNG AND OLD TRAILING SUNLIT BRILLIANT PATCHES
CLEAR EVEN AGAINST THE BRIGHT WHITE AND BLUE OF THE SKY ABOVE THEM
OFTEN HE LAUGHED ALOUD SENDING A GREAT SHOUT OF MIRTH ACROSS THE
WATER IN FRESH RELISH OF THOSE COMEDIES BEST KNOWN AND BEST ENJOYED
IT WAS AS EXCRUCIATINGLY FUNNY AS IT HAD EVER BEEN WHEN HIS BOAT
NOSED ITS WAY INTO A GREAT FLOCK OF DUCKS IDLING UPON THE WATER TO
SEE THE MAD PADDLING HASTE OF THOSE NEAREST HIM THE REPROACHFUL TURN
OF THEIR HEADS OR IF HE CAME TOO NEAR THEIR SPATTERING RUN OUT OF
WATER FEET AND WINGS PUMPING TOGETHER AS THEY ROSE FROM THE SURFACE
LOOKING FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE FAT LITTLE WOMEN SCURRYING WITH
CLUTCHED SKIRTS ACROSS CITY STREETS
THE PELICANS TOO DELIGHTED HIM
AS THEY PERCHED WITH PEDANTIC SOLEMNITY UPON WHARF PILES OR SAILED IN
HUNCHED AND HUDDLED GRAVITY TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE RIVER'S SURFACE IN
SWIFT DIGNIFIED FLIGHT WHICH ALWAYS ENDED SUDDENLY IN AN ABRUPT
UP ENDED PLUNGE THAT THREW DIGNITY TO THE WINDS IN ITS GREEDY HASTE
AND DROPPED THEM CRASHING INTO THE WATER
WHEN DARKNESS CAME SUDDENLY AT LAST HE MADE IN TOWARD SHORE MOORING
TO THE WARM FRETTED END OF A FALLEN AND FORGOTTEN LANDING
A
STRAGGLING ORANGE GROVE WAS HERE BROKEN LINES OF VANQUISHED
CULTIVATION STRUGGLING LITTLE TREES SWATHED AND CHOKED IN THE
FESTOONING GRAY MOSS STILL SHOWING HERE AND THERE THE VALIANT GOLDEN
GLEAM OF FRUIT
GIDEON HAD SEEN MANY SUCH PLACES HAD SEEN SETTLERS
COME AND CLEAR THEMSELVES A SPACE IN THE JUNGLE PLANT THEIR GROVES
AND LIVE FOR A WHILE IN LAZY INDEPENDENCE AND THEN FOR SOME REASON OR
OTHER THEY WOULD GO AND BEFORE THEY HAD SCARCELY TURNED THEIR BACKS
THE JUNGLE HAD CREPT IN AGAIN PATIENTLY RESTORING ITS ANCIENT
SOVEREIGNTY
THE PLACE WAS EERY WITH THE GHOST OF DEAD EFFORT BUT IT
PLEASED HIM
HE MADE A FIRE AND COOKED SUPPER EATING ENORMOUSLY AND WITH RELISH
HIS CONSCIENCE DID NOT TROUBLE HIM AT ALL
STUHK AND HIS OWN CAREER
SEEMED ALREADY DISTANT THEY TOOK SMALL PLACE IN HIS THOUGHTS AND
SERVED MERELY AS A BACKGROUND FOR HIS PRESENT ABSOLUTE CONTENT
HE
PICKED SOME ORANGES AND ATE THEM IN MEDITATIVE ENJOYMENT
FOR A WHILE
HE NODDED HALF ASLEEP BESIDE HIS FIRE WATCHING THE DARKENED RIVER
WHERE THE MULLET SHIMMERING WITH PHOSPHORESCENCE STILL LEAPED
STARKLY ABOVE THE SURFACE AND FELL IN SPATTERING BRILLIANCE
MIDNIGHT
FOUND HIM SPRAWLED ASLEEP BESIDE HIS FIRE
ONCE HE AWOKE
THE MOON HAD RISEN AND A LITTLE BREEZE WAVED THE
HANGING MOSS AND WHISPERED IN THE GLOSSY FOLIAGE OF ORANGE AND
PALMETTO WITH A SOUND LIKE FALLING RAIN
GIDEON SAT UP AND PEERED
ABOUT HIM ROLLING HIS EYES HITHER AND THITHER AT THE MENACING LEAP
AND DANCE OF THE JET SHADOWS
HIS HEART WAS BEATING THICKLY HIS
MUSCLES TWITCHED AND THE AWFUL TERRORS OF NIGHT PULSED AND SHUDDERED
OVER HIM
NAMELESS SPECTERS PEERED AT HIM FROM EVERY SHADOW
INGENERATE FAMILIARS OF HIS WILD FORGOTTEN BLOOD
HE GROANED ALOUD IN
A DELICIOUS TERROR AND PRESENTLY STILL TWITCHING AND SHIVERING FELL
ASLEEP AGAIN
IT WAS AS IF SOMETHING MAGICAL HAD HAPPENED HIS FEAR
REMEMBERED THE FEAR OF CENTURIES AND YET WITH THE WARM DAYLIGHT WAS
ABSOLUTELY FORGOTTEN
HE GOT UP A LITTLE AFTER SUNRISE AND WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER TO BATHE
DIVING DEEP WITH A JOYFUL SENSE OF FREEING HIMSELF FROM THE LAST ALIEN
DUST OF TRAVEL
ONCE ASHORE AGAIN HOWEVER HE BEGAN TO PREPARE HIS
BREAKFAST WITH SOME HASTE
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS JOURNEY HE WAS
FEELING A SENSE OF LONELINESS AND A LONGING FOR HIS KIND
HE WAS STILL
HAPPY BUT HIS LAUGHTER BEGAN TO SEEM STRANGE TO HIM IN THE SOLITUDE
HE TRIED THE DEFIANT EXPERIMENT OF LAUGHING FOR THE EFFECT OF IT AN
EXPERIMENT WHICH BROUGHT HIM TO HIS FEET IN STARTLED TERROR FOR HIS
LAUGHTER WAS ECHOED
AS HE STOOD PEERING ABOUT HIM THE SOUND CAME
AGAIN NOT LAUGHTER THIS TIME BUT A SUPPRESSED GIGGLE
IT WAS HUMAN
BEYOND A DOUBT
GIDEON'S FACE SHONE WITH RELIEF AND SYMPATHETIC
AMUSEMENT HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN STRODE SURELY FORWARD
TOWARD A CLUMP OF LOW PALMS
THERE HE PAUSED EVERY SENSE ALERT
HIS
EAR CAUGHT A SOFT RUSTLE A LITTLE GASP OF FEAR THE SOUND OF A FOOT
MOVED CAUTIOUSLY
MISSY HE SAID TENTATIVELY I RECKON YO' ALL'S COME JES 'BOUT 'N
TIME FOH BREAKFUS
YO' BETTEH HAVE SOME
EF YO' AIN' TOO WHITE TO SIT
DOWN WITH A BLACK MAN
THE LEAVES PARTED AND A SMILING FACE AS BLACK AS GIDEON'S OWN
REGARDED HIM IN SHY AMUSEMENT
WHO IS YO' MAN
I MOUGHT BE KING OF KONGO HE LAUGHED BUT I AIN'T
YO' SEE BEFO'
YO' JES GIDEON AT YO'R 'STEEMED SEHVICE HE BOWED ELABORATELY IN THE
MOCK HUMILITY OF ASSURED IMPORTANCE WATCHING HER FACE IN PLEASANT
ANTICIPATION
BUT NEITHER AWE NOR RAPTURE DAWNED THERE
SHE REPEATED THE NAME
INCLINING HER HEAD COQUETTISHLY BUT IT EVIDENTLY MEANT NOTHING TO
HER
SHE WAS MERELY TRYING ITS SOUND
GIDEON GIDEON
I DON' CALL TO
MIN' ANY SECH NAME EZ THAT
YO' ALL'S F'OM UP NO'TH LIKELY HE WAS
BEYOND THE REACHES OF FAME
NO SAID GIDEON HARDLY KNOWING WHETHER HE WAS GLAD OR SORRY NO I
LIVE SOUTH OF HEAH
WHAT ALL'S YO' NAME
THE GIRL GIGGLED DELICIOUSLY
MAN SHE SAID I SHU GOT THE MOS' REEDICULOUSTEST NAME YOU EVEH DID
HEAH
THEY CALL ME VASHTI YO' BACON'S BU'NIN' SHE STEPPED OUT AND
RAN PAST HIM TO SNATCH HIS SKILLET DEFTLY FROM THE FIRE
VASHTI A STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL NAME
GIDEON FOLLOWED HER SLOWLY
HER ROMANTIC COMING AND HER ROMANTIC NAME PLEASED HIM AND TOO HE
THOUGHT HER BEAUTIFUL
SHE WAS SCARCELY MORE THAN A GIRL SLIM AND
STRONG AND ALMOST OF HIS OWN HEIGHT
SHE WAS BAREFOOTED BUT HER
BLUE CHECKED GINGHAM WAS CLEAN AND BELTED SMARTLY ABOUT A SMALL WAIST
HE REMEMBERED ONLY ONE WOMAN WHO RAN AS LITHELY AS SHE DID ONE OF THE
NUMEROUS DIVING BEAUTIES OF THE VAUDEVILLE STAGE
SHE COOKED THEIR BREAKFAST BUT HE SERVED HER WITH AN ELABORATE
GALLANTRY PUTTING FORWARD ALL HIS NEW AND FOREIGN GRACES GARNISHING
HIS SPEECH WITH IMPOSING POLYSYLLABLES CASTING ABOUT THEIR PICNIC
BREAKFAST A RADIANT AURA OF GRANDEUR BORROWED FROM THE RECENT DAYS OF
HIS FAME
AND HE SAW THAT HE PLEASED HER AND WITH HER OPEN ADMIRATION
ESSAYED STILL GREATER FLIGHTS OF POLISHED MANNER
HE MADE VAGUE PLANS FOR DELAYING HIS JOURNEY AS THEY SAT SMOKING IN
PLEASANT CONVERSATIONAL EASE AND WHEN AN INTERRUPTION CAME IT VEXED
HIM
VASHTY VASHTY A WOMAN'S VOICE SOUNDED THIN AND FAR AWAY
VASHTY Y YO' HEAH ME CHILE
VASHTI ROSE TO HER FEET WITH A SIGH
THAT'S MY MA SHE SAID REGRETFULLY
WHAT DO YO' CARE ASKED GIDEON
LET HER YELL AWHILE
THE GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD
MA'S A MOUGHTY POW'FUL 'OMAN AND SHE DONE GOT A CLUB 'BOUT THE SIZE
O' MY WRIST SHE MOVED OFF A STEP OR SO AND GLANCED BACK AT HIM
GIDEON LEAPED TO HIS FEET
WHEN YO' COMIN' BACK YO' YO' AIN' GOIN' WITHOUT HE HELD OUT
HIS ARMS TO HER BUT SHE ONLY GIGGLED AND BEGAN TO WALK SLOWLY AWAY
WITH A BOUND HE WAS AFTER HER ONE HAND CATCHING HER LIGHTLY BY THE
SHOULDER
HE FELT SUDDENLY THAT HE MUST NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HER
LET ME GO TU'N ME LOOSE YO' THE GIRL WAS STILL LAUGHING BUT
EVIDENTLY TROUBLED
SHE WRENCHED HERSELF AWAY WITH AN EFFORT ONLY TO
BE CAUGHT AGAIN A MOMENT LATER
SHE SCREAMED AND STRUCK AT HIM AS HE
KISSED HER FOR NOW SHE WAS REALLY IN TERROR
THE BLOW CAUGHT GIDEON SQUARELY IN THE MOUTH AND WITH SUCH FORCE THAT
HE STAGGERED BACK ASTONISHED WHILE THE GIRL TOOK WILDLY TO HER
HEELS
HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT IRRESOLUTE FOR SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING
TO HIM
FOR MONTHS HE HAD EVADED LOVE WITH A GENTLE EMBARRASSMENT
NOW WITH THE SAVAGE CRASH OF THAT BLOW HE KNEW UNREASONINGLY THAT HE
HAD FOUND HIS WOMAN
HE LEAPED AFTER HER AGAIN RUNNING AS HE HAD NOT RUN IN YEARS IN
SAVAGE DETERMINED PURSUIT TEARING THROUGH BRIER AND SCRUB TRIPPING
FALLING RISING NEVER LOSING SIGHT OF THE BLUE CLAD FIGURE BEFORE HIM
UNTIL AT LAST SHE TRIPPED AND FELL AND HE STOOD PANTING ABOVE HER
HE TOOK A GREAT BREATH OR SO AND LEANED OVER AND PICKED HER UP IN HIS
ARMS WHERE SHE SCREAMED AND STRUCK AND SCRATCHED AT HIM
HE LAUGHED
FOR HE FELT NO LONGER SENSIBLE TO PAIN AND STILL CHUCKLING PICKED
HIS WAY CAREFULLY BACK TO THE SHORE WADING DEEP INTO THE WATER TO
UNMOOR HIS BOAT
THEN WITH A SWIFT MOVEMENT HE DROPPED THE GIRL INTO
THE BOW PUSHED FREE AND CLAMBERED ACTIVELY ABOARD
THE LIGHT EARLY MORNING BREEZE HAD FRESHENED AND HE MADE OUT WELL
TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER NEVER EVEN GLANCING AROUND AT THE
SOUND OF THE HALLOOING HE NOW HEARD FROM SHORE
HIS EXERTIONS HAD
QUICKENED HIS BREATHING BUT HE FELT STRONG AND JOYFUL
VASHTI LAY A
HUDDLE OF BLUE IN THE BOW CROUCHED IN FEAR AND DESOLATION SHAKEN AND
TORN WITH SOBBING BUT HE MADE NO EFFORT TO COMFORT HER
HE WAS
UNTROUBLED BY ANY SENSE OF WRONG HE WAS SIMPLY AND UNREASONINGLY
SATISFIED WITH WHAT HE HAD DONE
DESPITE ALL HIS GENTLE EASYGOING
LAUGHTER LOVING EXISTENCE HE FOUND NOTHING INCONGRUOUS OR UNNATURAL
IN THIS SUDDEN ACT OF VIOLENCE
HE WAS AGLOW WITH HAPPINESS HE WAS
TAKING HOME A WIFE
THE BLIND TUMULT OF CAPTURE HAD PASSED A GREAT
TENDERNESS POSSESSED HIM
THE LEAKY LITTLE BOAT WAS PLUNGING AND DANCING IN SWIFT ECSTASY OF
MOVEMENT ALL ABOUT THEM THE LITTLE WAVES RAN GLITTERING IN THE
SUNLIGHT PLASHING AND SLAPPING AGAINST THE BOAT'S LOW SIDE TOSSING
TINY CRESTS TO THE FOLLOWING WIND SHOWING RIFTS OF WHITE HERE AND
THERE BLOWING HANDFULS OF FOAM AND SPRAY
GIDEON WENT SOFTLY ABOUT
THE BUSINESS OF SHORTENING HIS SMALL SAIL AND CAME QUIETLY BACK TO
HIS STEERING SEAT AGAIN
SOON HE WOULD HAVE TO BE MAKING FOR WHAT LEA
THE WESTERN SHORE OFFERED BUT HE WAS HOLDING TO THE MIDDLE OF THE
RIVER AS LONG AS HE COULD BECAUSE WITH EVERY MILE THE SHORES WERE
GROWING MORE FAMILIAR CALLING TO HIM TO MAKE WHAT SPEED HE COULD
VASHTI'S SOBBING HAD GROWN SMALL AND CEASED HE WONDERED IF SHE HAD
FALLEN ASLEEP
PRESENTLY HOWEVER HE SAW HER FACE RAISED A FACE STILL SHINING WITH
TEARS
SHE SAW THAT HE WAS WATCHING HER AND CROUCHED LOW AGAIN
A
DASH OF SPRAY SPATTERED OVER HER AND SHE LOOKED UP FRIGHTENED
GLANCING FEARFULLY OVERSIDE THEN ONCE MORE HER EYES CAME BACK TO HIM
AND THIS TIME SHE GOT UP STILL SMALL AND CROUCHING AND MADE HER WAY
SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BOAT UNTIL AT LAST GIDEON
MOVED ASIDE FOR HER AND SHE SANK IN THE BOTTOM BESIDE HIM HIDING HER
EYES IN HER GINGHAM SLEEVE
GIDEON STRETCHED OUT A BROAD HAND AND TOUCHED HER HEAD LIGHTLY AND
WITH A TINY GASP HER FINGERS STOLE UP TO HIS
HONEY SAID GIDEON HONEY YO' AIN' MAD IS YO'
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOT LOOKING AT HIM
YO' AIN' GRIEVIN' FOH YO' MA
AGAIN SHE SHOOK HER HEAD
BECAUSE SAID GIDEON SMILING DOWN AT HER I AIN' GOT NO BEEG CLUB
LIKE SHE HAS
A SOFT AND SMOTHERED GIGGLE ANSWERED HIM AND THIS TIME VASHTI LOOKED
UP AND LAID HER HEAD AGAINST HIM WITH A SMALL SIGH OF CONTENTMENT
GIDEON FELT VERY TENDER VERY IMPORTANT AT PEACE WITH HIMSELF AND ALL
THE WORLD
HE ROUNDED A JUTTING POINT AND STRETCHED OUT A BLACK HAND

NOTES
CHAPTER I
THE BIRTH OF THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER
IN THE ANCIENT CITY OF LONDON ON A CERTAIN AUTUMN DAY IN THE SECOND
QUARTER OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY A BOY WAS BORN TO A POOR FAMILY OF THE
NAME OF CANTY WHO DID NOT WANT HIM
ON THE SAME DAY ANOTHER ENGLISH
CHILD WAS BORN TO A RICH FAMILY OF THE NAME OF TUDOR WHO DID WANT HIM
ALL ENGLAND WANTED HIM TOO
ENGLAND HAD SO LONGED FOR HIM AND HOPED
FOR HIM AND PRAYED GOD FOR HIM THAT NOW THAT HE WAS REALLY COME THE
PEOPLE WENT NEARLY MAD FOR JOY
MERE ACQUAINTANCES HUGGED AND KISSED
EACH OTHER AND CRIED
EVERYBODY TOOK A HOLIDAY AND HIGH AND LOW RICH
AND POOR FEASTED AND DANCED AND SANG AND GOT VERY MELLOW AND THEY
KEPT THIS UP FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS TOGETHER
BY DAY LONDON WAS A SIGHT
TO SEE WITH GAY BANNERS WAVING FROM EVERY BALCONY AND HOUSETOP AND
SPLENDID PAGEANTS MARCHING ALONG
BY NIGHT IT WAS AGAIN A SIGHT
TO SEE WITH ITS GREAT BONFIRES AT EVERY CORNER AND ITS TROOPS OF
REVELLERS MAKING MERRY AROUND THEM
THERE WAS NO TALK IN ALL ENGLAND
BUT OF THE NEW BABY EDWARD TUDOR PRINCE OF WALES WHO LAY LAPPED IN
SILKS AND SATINS UNCONSCIOUS OF ALL THIS FUSS AND NOT KNOWING THAT
GREAT LORDS AND LADIES WERE TENDING HIM AND WATCHING OVER HIM AND NOT
CARING EITHER
BUT THERE WAS NO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER BABY TOM CANTY
LAPPED IN HIS POOR RAGS EXCEPT AMONG THE FAMILY OF PAUPERS WHOM HE HAD
JUST COME TO TROUBLE WITH HIS PRESENCE
CHAPTER II
TOM'S EARLY LIFE
LET US SKIP A NUMBER OF YEARS
LONDON WAS FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND WAS A GREAT TOWN FOR THAT
DAY
IT HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND INHABITANTS SOME THINK DOUBLE AS MANY
THE STREETS WERE VERY NARROW AND CROOKED AND DIRTY ESPECIALLY IN THE
PART WHERE TOM CANTY LIVED WHICH WAS NOT FAR FROM LONDON BRIDGE
THE
HOUSES WERE OF WOOD WITH THE SECOND STORY PROJECTING OVER THE FIRST
AND THE THIRD STICKING ITS ELBOWS OUT BEYOND THE SECOND
THE HIGHER
THE HOUSES GREW THE BROADER THEY GREW
THEY WERE SKELETONS OF STRONG
CRISS CROSS BEAMS WITH SOLID MATERIAL BETWEEN COATED WITH PLASTER
THE BEAMS WERE PAINTED RED OR BLUE OR BLACK ACCORDING TO THE OWNER'S
TASTE AND THIS GAVE THE HOUSES A VERY PICTURESQUE LOOK
THE WINDOWS
WERE SMALL GLAZED WITH LITTLE DIAMOND SHAPED PANES AND THEY OPENED
OUTWARD ON HINGES LIKE DOORS
THE HOUSE WHICH TOM'S FATHER LIVED IN WAS UP A FOUL LITTLE POCKET CALLED
OFFAL COURT OUT OF PUDDING LANE
IT WAS SMALL DECAYED AND RICKETY
BUT IT WAS PACKED FULL OF WRETCHEDLY POOR FAMILIES
CANTY'S TRIBE
OCCUPIED A ROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR
THE MOTHER AND FATHER HAD A SORT OF
BEDSTEAD IN THE CORNER BUT TOM HIS GRANDMOTHER AND HIS TWO SISTERS
BET AND NAN WERE NOT RESTRICTED THEY HAD ALL THE FLOOR TO THEMSELVES
AND MIGHT SLEEP WHERE THEY CHOSE
THERE WERE THE REMAINS OF A BLANKET
OR TWO AND SOME BUNDLES OF ANCIENT AND DIRTY STRAW BUT THESE COULD NOT
RIGHTLY BE CALLED BEDS FOR THEY WERE NOT ORGANISED THEY WERE KICKED
INTO A GENERAL PILE MORNINGS AND SELECTIONS MADE FROM THE MASS AT
NIGHT FOR SERVICE
BET AND NAN WERE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD TWINS
THEY WERE GOOD HEARTED
GIRLS UNCLEAN CLOTHED IN RAGS AND PROFOUNDLY IGNORANT
THEIR MOTHER
WAS LIKE THEM
BUT THE FATHER AND THE GRANDMOTHER WERE A COUPLE OF
FIENDS
THEY GOT DRUNK WHENEVER THEY COULD THEN THEY FOUGHT EACH OTHER
OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO CAME IN THE WAY THEY CURSED AND SWORE ALWAYS DRUNK
OR SOBER JOHN CANTY WAS A THIEF AND HIS MOTHER A BEGGAR
THEY MADE
BEGGARS OF THE CHILDREN BUT FAILED TO MAKE THIEVES OF THEM
AMONG
BUT NOT OF THE DREADFUL RABBLE THAT INHABITED THE HOUSE WAS A GOOD OLD
PRIEST WHOM THE KING HAD TURNED OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME WITH A PENSION OF
A FEW FARTHINGS AND HE USED TO GET THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND TEACH THEM
RIGHT WAYS SECRETLY
FATHER ANDREW ALSO TAUGHT TOM A LITTLE LATIN AND
HOW TO READ AND WRITE AND WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME WITH THE GIRLS
BUT THEY WERE AFRAID OF THE JEERS OF THEIR FRIENDS WHO COULD NOT HAVE
ENDURED SUCH A QUEER ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THEM
ALL OFFAL COURT WAS JUST SUCH ANOTHER HIVE AS CANTY'S HOUSE
DRUNKENNESS RIOT AND BRAWLING WERE THE ORDER THERE EVERY NIGHT AND
NEARLY ALL NIGHT LONG
BROKEN HEADS WERE AS COMMON AS HUNGER IN THAT
PLACE
YET LITTLE TOM WAS NOT UNHAPPY
HE HAD A HARD TIME OF IT BUT
DID NOT KNOW IT
IT WAS THE SORT OF TIME THAT ALL THE OFFAL COURT BOYS
HAD THEREFORE HE SUPPOSED IT WAS THE CORRECT AND COMFORTABLE THING
WHEN HE CAME HOME EMPTY HANDED AT NIGHT HE KNEW HIS FATHER WOULD
CURSE HIM AND THRASH HIM FIRST AND THAT WHEN HE WAS DONE THE AWFUL
GRANDMOTHER WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN AND IMPROVE ON IT AND THAT AWAY
IN THE NIGHT HIS STARVING MOTHER WOULD SLIP TO HIM STEALTHILY WITH ANY
MISERABLE SCRAP OR CRUST SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE FOR HIM BY GOING
HUNGRY HERSELF NOTWITHSTANDING SHE WAS OFTEN CAUGHT IN THAT SORT OF
TREASON AND SOUNDLY BEATEN FOR IT BY HER HUSBAND
NO TOM'S LIFE WENT ALONG WELL ENOUGH ESPECIALLY IN SUMMER
HE ONLY
BEGGED JUST ENOUGH TO SAVE HIMSELF FOR THE LAWS AGAINST MENDICANCY WERE
STRINGENT AND THE PENALTIES HEAVY SO HE PUT IN A GOOD DEAL OF HIS TIME
LISTENING TO GOOD FATHER ANDREW'S CHARMING OLD TALES AND LEGENDS
ABOUT GIANTS AND FAIRIES DWARFS AND GENII AND ENCHANTED CASTLES AND
GORGEOUS KINGS AND PRINCES
HIS HEAD GREW TO BE FULL OF THESE WONDERFUL
THINGS AND MANY A NIGHT AS HE LAY IN THE DARK ON HIS SCANT AND
OFFENSIVE STRAW TIRED HUNGRY AND SMARTING FROM A THRASHING HE
UNLEASHED HIS IMAGINATION AND SOON FORGOT HIS ACHES AND PAINS IN
DELICIOUS PICTURINGS TO HIMSELF OF THE CHARMED LIFE OF A PETTED PRINCE
IN A REGAL PALACE
ONE DESIRE CAME IN TIME TO HAUNT HIM DAY AND NIGHT
IT WAS TO SEE A REAL PRINCE WITH HIS OWN EYES
HE SPOKE OF IT ONCE TO
SOME OF HIS OFFAL COURT COMRADES BUT THEY JEERED HIM AND SCOFFED HIM SO
UNMERCIFULLY THAT HE WAS GLAD TO KEEP HIS DREAM TO HIMSELF AFTER THAT
HE OFTEN READ THE PRIEST'S OLD BOOKS AND GOT HIM TO EXPLAIN AND ENLARGE
UPON THEM
HIS DREAMINGS AND READINGS WORKED CERTAIN CHANGES IN HIM
BY AND BY
HIS DREAM PEOPLE WERE SO FINE THAT HE GREW TO LAMENT HIS
SHABBY CLOTHING AND HIS DIRT AND TO WISH TO BE CLEAN AND BETTER CLAD
HE WENT ON PLAYING IN THE MUD JUST THE SAME AND ENJOYING IT TOO BUT
INSTEAD OF SPLASHING AROUND IN THE THAMES SOLELY FOR THE FUN OF IT
HE BEGAN TO FIND AN ADDED VALUE IN IT BECAUSE OF THE WASHINGS AND
CLEANSINGS IT AFFORDED
TOM COULD ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING GOING ON AROUND THE MAYPOLE IN
CHEAPSIDE AND AT THE FAIRS AND NOW AND THEN HE AND THE REST OF LONDON
HAD A CHANCE TO SEE A MILITARY PARADE WHEN SOME FAMOUS UNFORTUNATE WAS
CARRIED PRISONER TO THE TOWER BY LAND OR BOAT
ONE SUMMER'S DAY HE SAW
POOR ANNE ASKEW AND THREE MEN BURNED AT THE STAKE IN SMITHFIELD AND
HEARD AN EX BISHOP PREACH A SERMON TO THEM WHICH DID NOT INTEREST HIM
YES TOM'S LIFE WAS VARIED AND PLEASANT ENOUGH ON THE WHOLE
BY AND BY TOM'S READING AND DREAMING ABOUT PRINCELY LIFE WROUGHT SUCH A
STRONG EFFECT UPON HIM THAT HE BEGAN TO ACT THE PRINCE UNCONSCIOUSLY
HIS SPEECH AND MANNERS BECAME CURIOUSLY CEREMONIOUS AND COURTLY TO THE
VAST ADMIRATION AND AMUSEMENT OF HIS INTIMATES
BUT TOM'S INFLUENCE
AMONG THESE YOUNG PEOPLE BEGAN TO GROW NOW DAY BY DAY AND IN TIME HE
CAME TO BE LOOKED UP TO BY THEM WITH A SORT OF WONDERING AWE AS A
SUPERIOR BEING
HE SEEMED TO KNOW SO MUCH AND HE COULD DO AND SAY SUCH
MARVELLOUS THINGS AND WITHAL HE WAS SO DEEP AND WISE TOM'S REMARKS
AND TOM'S PERFORMANCES WERE REPORTED BY THE BOYS TO THEIR ELDERS AND
THESE ALSO PRESENTLY BEGAN TO DISCUSS TOM CANTY AND TO REGARD HIM
AS A MOST GIFTED AND EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE
FULL GROWN PEOPLE BROUGHT
THEIR PERPLEXITIES TO TOM FOR SOLUTION AND WERE OFTEN ASTONISHED AT THE
WIT AND WISDOM OF HIS DECISIONS
IN FACT HE WAS BECOME A HERO TO ALL
WHO KNEW HIM EXCEPT HIS OWN FAMILY THESE ONLY SAW NOTHING IN HIM
PRIVATELY AFTER A WHILE TOM ORGANISED A ROYAL COURT HE WAS THE
PRINCE HIS SPECIAL COMRADES WERE GUARDS CHAMBERLAINS EQUERRIES LORDS
AND LADIES IN WAITING AND THE ROYAL FAMILY
DAILY THE MOCK PRINCE WAS
RECEIVED WITH ELABORATE CEREMONIALS BORROWED BY TOM FROM HIS ROMANTIC
READINGS DAILY THE GREAT AFFAIRS OF THE MIMIC KINGDOM WERE DISCUSSED
IN THE ROYAL COUNCIL AND DAILY HIS MIMIC HIGHNESS ISSUED DECREES TO HIS
IMAGINARY ARMIES NAVIES AND VICEROYALTIES
AFTER WHICH HE WOULD GO FORTH IN HIS RAGS AND BEG A FEW FARTHINGS EAT
HIS POOR CRUST TAKE HIS CUSTOMARY CUFFS AND ABUSE AND THEN STRETCH
HIMSELF UPON HIS HANDFUL OF FOUL STRAW AND RESUME HIS EMPTY GRANDEURS
IN HIS DREAMS
AND STILL HIS DESIRE TO LOOK JUST ONCE UPON A REAL PRINCE IN THE FLESH
GREW UPON HIM DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK UNTIL AT LAST IT ABSORBED
ALL OTHER DESIRES AND BECAME THE ONE PASSION OF HIS LIFE
ONE JANUARY DAY ON HIS USUAL BEGGING TOUR HE TRAMPED DESPONDENTLY UP
AND DOWN THE REGION ROUND ABOUT MINCING LANE AND LITTLE EAST CHEAP HOUR
AFTER HOUR BARE FOOTED AND COLD LOOKING IN AT COOK SHOP WINDOWS AND
LONGING FOR THE DREADFUL PORK PIES AND OTHER DEADLY INVENTIONS DISPLAYED
THERE FOR TO HIM THESE WERE DAINTIES FIT FOR THE ANGELS THAT IS
JUDGING BY THE SMELL THEY WERE FOR IT HAD NEVER BEEN HIS GOOD LUCK TO
OWN AND EAT ONE
THERE WAS A COLD DRIZZLE OF RAIN THE ATMOSPHERE WAS
MURKY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY DAY
AT NIGHT TOM REACHED HOME SO WET AND
TIRED AND HUNGRY THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIS FATHER AND GRANDMOTHER
TO OBSERVE HIS FORLORN CONDITION AND NOT BE MOVED AFTER THEIR FASHION
WHEREFORE THEY GAVE HIM A BRISK CUFFING AT ONCE AND SENT HIM TO BED
FOR A LONG TIME HIS PAIN AND HUNGER AND THE SWEARING AND FIGHTING
GOING ON IN THE BUILDING KEPT HIM AWAKE BUT AT LAST HIS THOUGHTS
DRIFTED AWAY TO FAR ROMANTIC LANDS AND HE FELL ASLEEP IN THE COMPANY
OF JEWELLED AND GILDED PRINCELINGS WHO LIVE IN VAST PALACES AND HAD
SERVANTS SALAAMING BEFORE THEM OR FLYING TO EXECUTE THEIR ORDERS
AND
THEN AS USUAL HE DREAMED THAT HE WAS A PRINCELING HIMSELF
ALL NIGHT LONG THE GLORIES OF HIS ROYAL ESTATE SHONE UPON HIM HE MOVED
AMONG GREAT LORDS AND LADIES IN A BLAZE OF LIGHT BREATHING PERFUMES
DRINKING IN DELICIOUS MUSIC AND ANSWERING THE REVERENT OBEISANCES OF
THE GLITTERING THRONG AS IT PARTED TO MAKE WAY FOR HIM WITH HERE A
SMILE AND THERE A NOD OF HIS PRINCELY HEAD
AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING AND LOOKED UPON THE WRETCHEDNESS
ABOUT HIM HIS DREAM HAD HAD ITS USUAL EFFECT IT HAD INTENSIFIED THE
SORDIDNESS OF HIS SURROUNDINGS A THOUSANDFOLD
THEN CAME BITTERNESS
AND HEART BREAK AND TEARS
CHAPTER III
TOM'S MEETING WITH THE PRINCE
TOM GOT UP HUNGRY AND SAUNTERED HUNGRY AWAY BUT WITH HIS THOUGHTS BUSY
WITH THE SHADOWY SPLENDOURS OF HIS NIGHT'S DREAMS
HE WANDERED HERE
AND THERE IN THE CITY HARDLY NOTICING WHERE HE WAS GOING OR WHAT
WAS HAPPENING AROUND HIM
PEOPLE JOSTLED HIM AND SOME GAVE HIM ROUGH
SPEECH BUT IT WAS ALL LOST ON THE MUSING BOY
BY AND BY HE FOUND
HIMSELF AT TEMPLE BAR THE FARTHEST FROM HOME HE HAD EVER TRAVELLED IN
THAT DIRECTION
HE STOPPED AND CONSIDERED A MOMENT THEN FELL INTO HIS
IMAGININGS AGAIN AND PASSED ON OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF LONDON
THE STRAND
HAD CEASED TO BE A COUNTRY ROAD THEN AND REGARDED ITSELF AS A STREET
BUT BY A STRAINED CONSTRUCTION FOR THOUGH THERE WAS A TOLERABLY
COMPACT ROW OF HOUSES ON ONE SIDE OF IT THERE WERE ONLY SOME SCATTERED
GREAT BUILDINGS ON THE OTHER THESE BEING PALACES OF RICH NOBLES WITH
AMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL GROUNDS STRETCHING TO THE RIVER GROUNDS THAT ARE
NOW CLOSELY PACKED WITH GRIM ACRES OF BRICK AND STONE
TOM DISCOVERED CHARING VILLAGE PRESENTLY AND RESTED HIMSELF AT THE
BEAUTIFUL CROSS BUILT THERE BY A BEREAVED KING OF EARLIER DAYS THEN
IDLED DOWN A QUIET LOVELY ROAD PAST THE GREAT CARDINAL'S
STATELY PALACE TOWARD A FAR MORE MIGHTY AND MAJESTIC PALACE
BEYOND WESTMINSTER
TOM STARED IN GLAD WONDER AT THE VAST PILE OF
MASONRY THE WIDE SPREADING WINGS THE FROWNING BASTIONS AND TURRETS
THE HUGE STONE GATEWAY WITH ITS GILDED BARS AND ITS MAGNIFICENT ARRAY
OF COLOSSAL GRANITE LIONS AND OTHER THE SIGNS AND SYMBOLS OF ENGLISH
ROYALTY
WAS THE DESIRE OF HIS SOUL TO BE SATISFIED AT LAST HERE
INDEED WAS A KING'S PALACE
MIGHT HE NOT HOPE TO SEE A PRINCE NOW A
PRINCE OF FLESH AND BLOOD IF HEAVEN WERE WILLING
AT EACH SIDE OF THE GILDED GATE STOOD A LIVING STATUE THAT IS TO SAY
AN ERECT AND STATELY AND MOTIONLESS MAN AT ARMS CLAD FROM HEAD TO HEEL
IN SHINING STEEL ARMOUR
AT A RESPECTFUL DISTANCE WERE MANY COUNTRY
FOLK AND PEOPLE FROM THE CITY WAITING FOR ANY CHANCE GLIMPSE OF
ROYALTY THAT MIGHT OFFER
SPLENDID CARRIAGES WITH SPLENDID PEOPLE
IN THEM AND SPLENDID SERVANTS OUTSIDE WERE ARRIVING AND DEPARTING BY
SEVERAL OTHER NOBLE GATEWAYS THAT PIERCED THE ROYAL ENCLOSURE
POOR LITTLE TOM IN HIS RAGS APPROACHED AND WAS MOVING SLOWLY AND
TIMIDLY PAST THE SENTINELS WITH A BEATING HEART AND A RISING HOPE WHEN
ALL AT ONCE HE CAUGHT SIGHT THROUGH THE GOLDEN BARS OF A SPECTACLE THAT
ALMOST MADE HIM SHOUT FOR JOY
WITHIN WAS A COMELY BOY TANNED AND
BROWN WITH STURDY OUTDOOR SPORTS AND EXERCISES WHOSE CLOTHING WAS ALL
OF LOVELY SILKS AND SATINS SHINING WITH JEWELS AT HIS HIP A LITTLE
JEWELLED SWORD AND DAGGER DAINTY BUSKINS ON HIS FEET WITH RED HEELS
AND ON HIS HEAD A JAUNTY CRIMSON CAP WITH DROOPING PLUMES FASTENED
WITH A GREAT SPARKLING GEM
SEVERAL GORGEOUS GENTLEMEN STOOD NEAR HIS
SERVANTS WITHOUT A DOUBT
OH HE WAS A PRINCE A PRINCE A LIVING
PRINCE A REAL PRINCE WITHOUT THE SHADOW OF A QUESTION AND THE PRAYER
OF THE PAUPER BOY'S HEART WAS ANSWERED AT LAST
TOM'S BREATH CAME QUICK AND SHORT WITH EXCITEMENT AND HIS EYES GREW BIG
WITH WONDER AND DELIGHT
EVERYTHING GAVE WAY IN HIS MIND INSTANTLY
TO ONE DESIRE THAT WAS TO GET CLOSE TO THE PRINCE AND HAVE A GOOD
DEVOURING LOOK AT HIM
BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE HAD HIS
FACE AGAINST THE GATE BARS
THE NEXT INSTANT ONE OF THE SOLDIERS
SNATCHED HIM RUDELY AWAY AND SENT HIM SPINNING AMONG THE GAPING CROWD
OF COUNTRY GAWKS AND LONDON IDLERS
THE SOLDIER SAID
MIND THY MANNERS THOU YOUNG BEGGAR
THE CROWD JEERED AND LAUGHED BUT THE YOUNG PRINCE SPRANG TO THE GATE
WITH HIS FACE FLUSHED AND HIS EYES FLASHING WITH INDIGNATION AND CRIED
OUT
HOW DAR'ST THOU USE A POOR LAD LIKE THAT HOW DAR'ST THOU USE THE KING
MY FATHER'S MEANEST SUBJECT SO OPEN THE GATES AND LET HIM IN
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT FICKLE CROWD SNATCH OFF THEIR HATS THEN
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD THEM CHEER AND SHOUT LONG LIVE THE PRINCE OF
WALES
THE SOLDIERS PRESENTED ARMS WITH THEIR HALBERDS OPENED THE GATES
AND PRESENTED AGAIN AS THE LITTLE PRINCE OF POVERTY PASSED IN IN HIS
FLUTTERING RAGS TO JOIN HANDS WITH THE PRINCE OF LIMITLESS PLENTY
EDWARD TUDOR SAID
THOU LOOKEST TIRED AND HUNGRY THOU'ST BEEN TREATED ILL
COME WITH
ME
HALF A DOZEN ATTENDANTS SPRANG FORWARD TO I DON'T KNOW WHAT INTERFERE
NO DOUBT
BUT THEY WERE WAVED ASIDE WITH A RIGHT ROYAL GESTURE AND
THEY STOPPED STOCK STILL WHERE THEY WERE LIKE SO MANY STATUES
EDWARD
TOOK TOM TO A RICH APARTMENT IN THE PALACE WHICH HE CALLED HIS CABINET
BY HIS COMMAND A REPAST WAS BROUGHT SUCH AS TOM HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED
BEFORE EXCEPT IN BOOKS
THE PRINCE WITH PRINCELY DELICACY AND
BREEDING SENT AWAY THE SERVANTS SO THAT HIS HUMBLE GUEST MIGHT NOT BE
EMBARRASSED BY THEIR CRITICAL PRESENCE THEN HE SAT NEAR BY AND ASKED
QUESTIONS WHILE TOM ATE

STAMPING HIS BARE FOOT
IF THE KING STIR NOT A STEP TILL I COME

IN A MOMENT HE HAD SNATCHED UP AND PUT AWAY AN ARTICLE OF NATIONAL
IMPORTANCE THAT LAY UPON A TABLE AND WAS OUT AT THE DOOR AND FLYING
THROUGH THE PALACE GROUNDS IN HIS BANNERED RAGS WITH A HOT FACE AND
GLOWING EYES
AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE GREAT GATE HE SEIZED THE BARS
AND TRIED TO SHAKE THEM SHOUTING
OPEN UNBAR THE GATES
THE SOLDIER THAT HAD MALTREATED TOM OBEYED PROMPTLY AND AS THE PRINCE
BURST THROUGH THE PORTAL HALF SMOTHERED WITH ROYAL WRATH THE SOLDIER

ROADWAY AND SAID

THE PRINCE PICKED HIMSELF OUT OF THE
MUD AND MADE FIERCELY AT THE SENTRY SHOUTING

THE SOLDIER BROUGHT HIS HALBERD TO A PRESENT ARMS AND SAID MOCKINGLY

RUBBISH
HERE THE JEERING CROWD CLOSED ROUND THE POOR LITTLE PRINCE AND HUSTLED
HIM FAR DOWN THE ROAD HOOTING HIM AND SHOUTING
WAY FOR HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WAY FOR THE PRINCE OF WALES
CHAPTER IV
THE PRINCE'S TROUBLES BEGIN
AFTER HOURS OF PERSISTENT PURSUIT AND PERSECUTION THE LITTLE PRINCE WAS
AT LAST DESERTED BY THE RABBLE AND LEFT TO HIMSELF
AS LONG AS HE HAD
BEEN ABLE TO RAGE AGAINST THE MOB AND THREATEN IT ROYALLY AND
ROYALLY UTTER COMMANDS THAT WERE GOOD STUFF TO LAUGH AT HE WAS VERY
ENTERTAINING BUT WHEN WEARINESS FINALLY FORCED HIM TO BE SILENT HE WAS
NO LONGER OF USE TO HIS TORMENTORS AND THEY SOUGHT AMUSEMENT ELSEWHERE
HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM NOW BUT COULD NOT RECOGNISE THE LOCALITY
HE
WAS WITHIN THE CITY OF LONDON THAT WAS ALL HE KNEW
HE MOVED ON
AIMLESSLY AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE HOUSES THINNED AND THE PASSERS BY
WERE INFREQUENT
HE BATHED HIS BLEEDING FEET IN THE BROOK WHICH FLOWED
THEN WHERE FARRINGDON STREET NOW IS RESTED A FEW MOMENTS THEN PASSED
ON AND PRESENTLY CAME UPON A GREAT SPACE WITH ONLY A FEW SCATTERED
HOUSES IN IT AND A PRODIGIOUS CHURCH
HE RECOGNISED THIS CHURCH
SCAFFOLDINGS WERE ABOUT EVERYWHERE AND SWARMS OF WORKMEN FOR IT WAS
UNDERGOING ELABORATE REPAIRS
THE PRINCE TOOK HEART AT ONCE HE FELT
THAT HIS TROUBLES WERE AT AN END NOW
HE SAID TO HIMSELF IT IS THE
ANCIENT GREY FRIARS' CHURCH WHICH THE KING MY FATHER HATH TAKEN FROM
THE MONKS AND GIVEN FOR A HOME FOR EVER FOR POOR AND FORSAKEN CHILDREN
AND NEW NAMED IT CHRIST'S CHURCH
RIGHT GLADLY WILL THEY SERVE THE SON
OF HIM WHO HATH DONE SO GENEROUSLY BY THEM AND THE MORE THAT THAT SON
IS HIMSELF AS POOR AND AS FORLORN AS ANY THAT BE SHELTERED HERE THIS
DAY OR EVER SHALL BE
HE WAS SOON IN THE MIDST OF A CROWD OF BOYS WHO WERE RUNNING JUMPING
PLAYING AT BALL AND LEAP FROG AND OTHERWISE DISPORTING THEMSELVES AND
RIGHT NOISILY TOO
THEY WERE ALL DRESSED ALIKE AND IN THE FASHION
WHICH IN THAT DAY PREVAILED AMONG SERVING MEN AND 'PRENTICES 1 THAT
IS TO SAY EACH HAD ON THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD A FLAT BLACK CAP ABOUT THE
SIZE OF A SAUCER WHICH WAS NOT USEFUL AS A COVERING IT BEING OF SUCH
SCANTY DIMENSIONS NEITHER WAS IT ORNAMENTAL FROM BENEATH IT THE HAIR
FELL UNPARTED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREHEAD AND WAS CROPPED STRAIGHT
AROUND A CLERICAL BAND AT THE NECK A BLUE GOWN THAT FITTED CLOSELY
AND HUNG AS LOW AS THE KNEES OR LOWER FULL SLEEVES A BROAD RED BELT
BRIGHT YELLOW STOCKINGS GARTERED ABOVE THE KNEES LOW SHOES WITH LARGE
METAL BUCKLES
IT WAS A SUFFICIENTLY UGLY COSTUME
THE BOYS STOPPED THEIR PLAY AND FLOCKED ABOUT THE PRINCE WHO SAID WITH
NATIVE DIGNITY
GOOD LADS SAY TO YOUR MASTER THAT EDWARD PRINCE OF WALES DESIRETH
SPEECH WITH HIM
A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP AT THIS AND ONE RUDE FELLOW SAID
MARRY ART THOU HIS GRACE'S MESSENGER BEGGAR
THE PRINCE'S FACE FLUSHED WITH ANGER AND HIS READY HAND FLEW TO HIS
HIP BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
THERE WAS A STORM OF LAUGHTER AND
ONE BOY SAID
DIDST MARK THAT HE FANCIED HE HAD A SWORD BELIKE HE IS THE PRINCE
HIMSELF
THIS SALLY BROUGHT MORE LAUGHTER
POOR EDWARD DREW HIMSELF UP PROUDLY
AND SAID
I AM THE PRINCE AND IT ILL BESEEMETH YOU THAT FEED UPON THE KING MY
FATHER'S BOUNTY TO USE ME SO
THIS WAS VASTLY ENJOYED AS THE LAUGHTER TESTIFIED
THE YOUTH WHO HAD
FIRST SPOKEN SHOUTED TO HIS COMRADES
HO SWINE SLAVES PENSIONERS OF HIS GRACE'S PRINCELY FATHER WHERE BE
YOUR MANNERS DOWN ON YOUR MARROW BONES ALL OF YE AND DO REVERENCE TO
HIS KINGLY PORT AND ROYAL RAGS
WITH BOISTEROUS MIRTH THEY DROPPED UPON THEIR KNEES IN A BODY AND DID
MOCK HOMAGE TO THEIR PREY
THE PRINCE SPURNED THE NEAREST BOY WITH HIS
FOOT AND SAID FIERCELY
TAKE THOU THAT TILL THE MORROW COME AND I BUILD THEE A GIBBET
AH BUT THIS WAS NOT A JOKE THIS WAS GOING BEYOND FUN
THE LAUGHTER
CEASED ON THE INSTANT AND FURY TOOK ITS PLACE
A DOZEN SHOUTED
HALE HIM FORTH TO THE HORSE POND TO THE HORSE POND WHERE BE THE
DOGS HO THERE LION HO FANGS
THEN FOLLOWED SUCH A THING AS ENGLAND HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE THE SACRED
PERSON OF THE HEIR TO THE THRONE RUDELY BUFFETED BY PLEBEIAN HANDS AND
SET UPON AND TORN BY DOGS
AS NIGHT DREW TO A CLOSE THAT DAY THE PRINCE FOUND HIMSELF FAR DOWN IN
THE CLOSE BUILT PORTION OF THE CITY
HIS BODY WAS BRUISED HIS HANDS
WERE BLEEDING AND HIS RAGS WERE ALL BESMIRCHED WITH MUD
HE WANDERED
ON AND ON AND GREW MORE AND MORE BEWILDERED AND SO TIRED AND FAINT
HE COULD HARDLY DRAG ONE FOOT AFTER THE OTHER
HE HAD CEASED TO ASK
QUESTIONS OF ANYONE SINCE THEY BROUGHT HIM ONLY INSULT INSTEAD OF
INFORMATION
HE KEPT MUTTERING TO HIMSELF OFFAL COURT THAT IS THE
NAME IF I CAN BUT FIND IT BEFORE MY STRENGTH IS WHOLLY SPENT AND I
DROP THEN AM I SAVED FOR HIS PEOPLE WILL TAKE ME TO THE PALACE AND
PROVE THAT I AM NONE OF THEIRS BUT THE TRUE PRINCE AND I SHALL HAVE
MINE OWN AGAIN AND NOW AND THEN HIS MIND REVERTED TO HIS TREATMENT
BY THOSE RUDE CHRIST'S HOSPITAL BOYS AND HE SAID WHEN I AM KING THEY
SHALL NOT HAVE BREAD AND SHELTER ONLY BUT ALSO TEACHINGS OUT OF BOOKS
FOR A FULL BELLY IS LITTLE WORTH WHERE THE MIND IS STARVED AND THE
HEART
I WILL KEEP THIS DILIGENTLY IN MY REMEMBRANCE THAT THIS DAY'S
LESSON BE NOT LOST UPON ME AND MY PEOPLE SUFFER THEREBY FOR LEARNING
SOFTENETH THE HEART AND BREEDETH GENTLENESS AND CHARITY 1
THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO TWINKLE IT CAME ON TO RAIN THE WIND ROSE AND A
RAW AND GUSTY NIGHT SET IN
THE HOUSELESS PRINCE THE HOMELESS HEIR TO
THE THRONE OF ENGLAND STILL MOVED ON DRIFTING DEEPER INTO THE MAZE
OF SQUALID ALLEYS WHERE THE SWARMING HIVES OF POVERTY AND MISERY WERE
MASSED TOGETHER
SUDDENLY A GREAT DRUNKEN RUFFIAN COLLARED HIM AND SAID
OUT TO THIS TIME OF NIGHT AGAIN AND HAST NOT BROUGHT A FARTHING HOME
I WARRANT ME IF IT BE SO AN' I DO NOT BREAK ALL THE BONES IN THY LEAN
BODY THEN AM I NOT JOHN CANTY BUT SOME OTHER
THE PRINCE TWISTED HIMSELF LOOSE UNCONSCIOUSLY BRUSHED HIS PROFANED
SHOULDER AND EAGERLY SAID
OH ART HIS FATHER TRULY SWEET HEAVEN GRANT IT BE SO THEN WILT
THOU FETCH HIM AWAY AND RESTORE ME
HIS FATHER I KNOW NOT WHAT THOU MEAN'ST I BUT KNOW I AM THY
FATHER AS THOU SHALT SOON HAVE CAUSE TO
OH JEST NOT PALTER NOT DELAY NOT I AM WORN I AM WOUNDED I CAN
BEAR NO MORE
TAKE ME TO THE KING MY FATHER AND HE WILL MAKE THEE RICH
BEYOND THY WILDEST DREAMS
BELIEVE ME MAN BELIEVE ME I SPEAK NO
LIE BUT ONLY THE TRUTH PUT FORTH THY HAND AND SAVE ME I AM INDEED
THE PRINCE OF WALES
THE MAN STARED DOWN STUPEFIED UPON THE LAD THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD AND
MUTTERED
GONE STARK MAD AS ANY TOM O' BEDLAM THEN COLLARED HIM ONCE MORE
AND SAID WITH A COARSE LAUGH AND AN OATH BUT MAD OR NO MAD I AND THY
GAMMER CANTY WILL SOON FIND WHERE THE SOFT PLACES IN THY BONES LIE OR
I'M NO TRUE MAN
WITH THIS HE DRAGGED THE FRANTIC AND STRUGGLING PRINCE AWAY AND
DISAPPEARED UP A FRONT COURT FOLLOWED BY A DELIGHTED AND NOISY SWARM OF
HUMAN VERMIN
CHAPTER V
TOM AS A PATRICIAN
TOM CANTY LEFT ALONE IN THE PRINCE'S CABINET MADE GOOD USE OF HIS
OPPORTUNITY
HE TURNED HIMSELF THIS WAY AND THAT BEFORE THE GREAT
MIRROR ADMIRING HIS FINERY THEN WALKED AWAY IMITATING THE PRINCE'S
HIGH BRED CARRIAGE AND STILL OBSERVING RESULTS IN THE GLASS
NEXT HE
DREW THE BEAUTIFUL SWORD AND BOWED KISSING THE BLADE AND LAYING IT
ACROSS HIS BREAST AS HE HAD SEEN A NOBLE KNIGHT DO BY WAY OF SALUTE TO
THE LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER FIVE OR SIX WEEKS BEFORE WHEN DELIVERING
THE GREAT LORDS OF NORFOLK AND SURREY INTO HIS HANDS FOR CAPTIVITY
TOM
PLAYED WITH THE JEWELLED DAGGER THAT HUNG UPON HIS THIGH HE EXAMINED
THE COSTLY AND EXQUISITE ORNAMENTS OF THE ROOM HE TRIED EACH OF THE
SUMPTUOUS CHAIRS AND THOUGHT HOW PROUD HE WOULD BE IF THE OFFAL COURT
HERD COULD ONLY PEEP IN AND SEE HIM IN HIS GRANDEUR
HE WONDERED IF
THEY WOULD BELIEVE THE MARVELLOUS TALE HE SHOULD TELL WHEN HE GOT HOME
OR IF THEY WOULD SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND SAY HIS OVERTAXED IMAGINATION
HAD AT LAST UPSET HIS REASON
AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE PRINCE
WAS GONE A LONG TIME THEN RIGHT AWAY HE BEGAN TO FEEL LONELY VERY
SOON HE FELL TO LISTENING AND LONGING AND CEASED TO TOY WITH THE
PRETTY THINGS ABOUT HIM HE GREW UNEASY THEN RESTLESS THEN DISTRESSED
SUPPOSE SOME ONE SHOULD COME AND CATCH HIM IN THE PRINCE'S CLOTHES AND
THE PRINCE NOT THERE TO EXPLAIN
MIGHT THEY NOT HANG HIM AT ONCE
AND INQUIRE INTO HIS CASE AFTERWARD HE HAD HEARD THAT THE GREAT
WERE PROMPT ABOUT SMALL MATTERS
HIS FEAR ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER AND
TREMBLING HE SOFTLY OPENED THE DOOR TO THE ANTECHAMBER RESOLVED TO
FLY AND SEEK THE PRINCE AND THROUGH HIM PROTECTION AND RELEASE
SIX
GORGEOUS GENTLEMEN SERVANTS AND TWO YOUNG PAGES OF HIGH DEGREE CLOTHED
LIKE BUTTERFLIES SPRANG TO THEIR FEET AND BOWED LOW BEFORE HIM
HE
STEPPED QUICKLY BACK AND SHUT THE DOOR
HE SAID
OH THEY MOCK AT ME THEY WILL GO AND TELL
OH WHY CAME I HERE TO
CAST AWAY MY LIFE
HE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR FILLED WITH NAMELESS FEARS LISTENING
STARTING AT EVERY TRIFLING SOUND
PRESENTLY THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN AND A
SILKEN PAGE SAID
THE LADY JANE GREY
THE DOOR CLOSED AND A SWEET YOUNG GIRL RICHLY CLAD BOUNDED TOWARD HIM
BUT SHE STOPPED SUDDENLY AND SAID IN A DISTRESSED VOICE
OH WHAT AILETH THEE MY LORD
TOM'S BREATH WAS NEARLY FAILING HIM BUT HE MADE SHIFT TO STAMMER OUT
AH BE MERCIFUL THOU IN SOOTH I AM NO LORD BUT ONLY POOR TOM CANTY
OF OFFAL COURT IN THE CITY
PRITHEE LET ME SEE THE PRINCE AND HE WILL
OF HIS GRACE RESTORE TO ME MY RAGS AND LET ME HENCE UNHURT
OH BE
THOU MERCIFUL AND SAVE ME
BY THIS TIME THE BOY WAS ON HIS KNEES AND SUPPLICATING WITH HIS EYES
AND UPLIFTED HANDS AS WELL AS WITH HIS TONGUE
THE YOUNG GIRL SEEMED
HORROR STRICKEN
SHE CRIED OUT
O MY LORD ON THY KNEES AND TO ME
THEN SHE FLED AWAY IN FRIGHT AND TOM SMITTEN WITH DESPAIR SANK DOWN
MURMURING
THERE IS NO HELP THERE IS NO HOPE
NOW WILL THEY COME AND TAKE ME
WHILST HE LAY THERE BENUMBED WITH TERROR DREADFUL TIDINGS WERE SPEEDING
THROUGH THE PALACE
THE WHISPER FOR IT WAS WHISPERED ALWAYS FLEW FROM
MENIAL TO MENIAL FROM LORD TO LADY DOWN ALL THE LONG CORRIDORS FROM
STORY TO STORY FROM SALOON TO SALOON THE PRINCE HATH GONE MAD THE
PRINCE HATH GONE MAD SOON EVERY SALOON EVERY MARBLE HALL HAD ITS
GROUPS OF GLITTERING LORDS AND LADIES AND OTHER GROUPS OF DAZZLING
LESSER FOLK TALKING EARNESTLY TOGETHER IN WHISPERS AND EVERY FACE
HAD IN IT DISMAY
PRESENTLY A SPLENDID OFFICIAL CAME MARCHING BY THESE
GROUPS MAKING SOLEMN PROCLAMATION
IN THE NAME OF THE KING
LET NONE LIST TO THIS FALSE AND FOOLISH MATTER UPON PAIN OF DEATH NOR
DISCUSS THE SAME NOR CARRY IT ABROAD
IN THE NAME OF THE KING
THE WHISPERINGS CEASED AS SUDDENLY AS IF THE WHISPERERS HAD BEEN
STRICKEN DUMB
SOON THERE WAS A GENERAL BUZZ ALONG THE CORRIDORS OF THE PRINCE SEE
THE PRINCE COMES
POOR TOM CAME SLOWLY WALKING PAST THE LOW BOWING GROUPS TRYING TO
BOW IN RETURN AND MEEKLY GAZING UPON HIS STRANGE SURROUNDINGS WITH
BEWILDERED AND PATHETIC EYES
GREAT NOBLES WALKED UPON EACH SIDE OF
HIM MAKING HIM LEAN UPON THEM AND SO STEADY HIS STEPS
BEHIND HIM
FOLLOWED THE COURT PHYSICIANS AND SOME SERVANTS
PRESENTLY TOM FOUND HIMSELF IN A NOBLE APARTMENT OF THE PALACE AND HEARD
THE DOOR CLOSE BEHIND HIM
AROUND HIM STOOD THOSE WHO HAD COME WITH
HIM
BEFORE HIM AT A LITTLE DISTANCE RECLINED A VERY LARGE AND VERY
FAT MAN WITH A WIDE PULPY FACE AND A STERN EXPRESSION
HIS LARGE
HEAD WAS VERY GREY AND HIS WHISKERS WHICH HE WORE ONLY AROUND HIS
FACE LIKE A FRAME WERE GREY ALSO
HIS CLOTHING WAS OF RICH STUFF
BUT OLD AND SLIGHTLY FRAYED IN PLACES
ONE OF HIS SWOLLEN LEGS HAD A
PILLOW UNDER IT AND WAS WRAPPED IN BANDAGES
THERE WAS SILENCE NOW
AND THERE WAS NO HEAD THERE BUT WAS BENT IN REVERENCE EXCEPT THIS
MAN'S
THIS STERN COUNTENANCED INVALID WAS THE DREAD HENRY VIII
HE
SAID AND HIS FACE GREW GENTLE AS HE BEGAN TO SPEAK
HOW NOW MY LORD EDWARD MY PRINCE HAST BEEN MINDED TO COZEN ME THE
GOOD KING THY FATHER WHO LOVETH THEE AND KINDLY USETH THEE WITH A
SORRY JEST
POOR TOM WAS LISTENING AS WELL AS HIS DAZED FACULTIES WOULD LET HIM
TO THE BEGINNING OF THIS SPEECH BUT WHEN THE WORDS 'ME THE GOOD KING'
FELL UPON HIS EAR HIS FACE BLANCHED AND HE DROPPED AS INSTANTLY UPON
HIS KNEES AS IF A SHOT HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE
LIFTING UP HIS HANDS HE
EXCLAIMED
THOU THE KING THEN AM I UNDONE INDEED
THIS SPEECH SEEMED TO STUN THE KING
HIS EYES WANDERED FROM FACE TO
FACE AIMLESSLY THEN RESTED BEWILDERED UPON THE BOY BEFORE HIM
THEN
HE SAID IN A TONE OF DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT
ALACK I HAD BELIEVED THE RUMOUR DISPROPORTIONED TO THE TRUTH BUT I
FEAR ME 'TIS NOT SO HE BREATHED A HEAVY SIGH AND SAID IN A GENTLE
VOICE COME TO THY FATHER CHILD THOU ART NOT WELL
TOM WAS ASSISTED TO HIS FEET AND APPROACHED THE MAJESTY OF ENGLAND
HUMBLE AND TREMBLING
THE KING TOOK THE FRIGHTENED FACE BETWEEN HIS
HANDS AND GAZED EARNESTLY AND LOVINGLY INTO IT AWHILE AS IF SEEKING
SOME GRATEFUL SIGN OF RETURNING REASON THERE THEN PRESSED THE CURLY
HEAD AGAINST HIS BREAST AND PATTED IT TENDERLY
PRESENTLY HE SAID

TOM DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES WITH A GLAD CRY
GOD REQUITE THY MERCY O MY KING AND SAVE THEE LONG TO BLESS THY

IN WAITING AND EXCLAIMED THOU HEARD'ST IT I AM NOT TO DIE THE
KING HATH SAID IT THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT SAVE THAT ALL BOWED WITH
GRAVE RESPECT BUT NO ONE SPOKE
HE HESITATED A LITTLE CONFUSED THEN
TURNED TIMIDLY TOWARD THE KING SAYING I MAY GO NOW

HARBOURETH MY MOTHER AND MY SISTERS AND SO IS HOME TO ME WHEREAS THESE
POMPS AND SPLENDOURS WHEREUNTO I AM NOT USED OH PLEASE YOU SIR TO

HOPE IN HIS VOICE
PERCHANCE HE IS BUT MAD UPON THIS ONE STRAIN AND HATH HIS WITS
UNMARRED AS TOUCHETH OTHER MATTER

EMBARRASSED BY HAVING SO MANY EYES CENTRED UPON HIM THEN SAID
DIFFIDENTLY

BE SET FREE
ONCE MORE HE HEARD THE BUZZ OF LOW VOICES EXCLAIMING THE

TOM WAS NEAR TO BREAKING DOWN AND CONFESSING HIMSELF UNEQUAL TO HIS
TREMENDOUS PART BUT THE TACT OF THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH SAVED HIM OR A
WORD FROM ONE OR THE OTHER OF THE VIGILANT LORDS THROWN IN APPARENTLY
BY CHANCE HAD THE SAME HAPPY EFFECT
ONCE THE LITTLE LADY JANE TURNED
TO TOM AND DISMAYED HIM WITH THIS QUESTION
HAST PAID THY DUTY TO THE QUEEN'S MAJESTY TO DAY MY LORD
TOM HESITATED LOOKED DISTRESSED AND WAS ABOUT TO STAMMER OUT SOMETHING
AT HAZARD WHEN LORD ST
JOHN TOOK THE WORD AND ANSWERED FOR HIM
WITH THE EASY GRACE OF A COURTIER ACCUSTOMED TO ENCOUNTER DELICATE
DIFFICULTIES AND TO BE READY FOR THEM
HE HATH INDEED MADAM AND SHE DID GREATLY HEARTEN HIM AS TOUCHING HIS
MAJESTY'S CONDITION IS IT NOT SO YOUR HIGHNESS
TOM MUMBLED SOMETHING THAT STOOD FOR ASSENT BUT FELT THAT HE WAS
GETTING UPON DANGEROUS GROUND
SOMEWHAT LATER IT WAS MENTIONED THAT
TOM WAS TO STUDY NO MORE AT PRESENT WHEREUPON HER LITTLE LADYSHIP
EXCLAIMED
'TIS A PITY 'TIS A PITY THOU WERT PROCEEDING BRAVELY
BUT BIDE THY
TIME IN PATIENCE IT WILL NOT BE FOR LONG
THOU'LT YET BE GRACED
WITH LEARNING LIKE THY FATHER AND MAKE THY TONGUE MASTER OF AS MANY
LANGUAGES AS HIS GOOD MY PRINCE
MY FATHER CRIED TOM OFF HIS GUARD FOR THE MOMENT
I TROW HE CANNOT
SPEAK HIS OWN SO THAT ANY BUT THE SWINE THAT KENNEL IN THE STYES MAY
TELL HIS MEANING AND AS FOR LEARNING OF ANY SORT SOEVER
HE LOOKED UP AND ENCOUNTERED A SOLEMN WARNING IN MY LORD ST
JOHN'S
EYES
HE STOPPED BLUSHED THEN CONTINUED LOW AND SADLY AH MY MALADY
PERSECUTETH ME AGAIN AND MY MIND WANDERETH
I MEANT THE KING'S GRACE
NO IRREVERENCE
WE KNOW IT SIR SAID THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH TAKING HER 'BROTHER'S'
HAND BETWEEN HER TWO PALMS RESPECTFULLY BUT CARESSINGLY TROUBLE NOT
THYSELF AS TO THAT
THE FAULT IS NONE OF THINE BUT THY DISTEMPER'S
THOU'RT A GENTLE COMFORTER SWEET LADY SAID TOM GRATEFULLY AND MY
HEART MOVETH ME TO THANK THEE FOR'T AN' I MAY BE SO BOLD
ONCE THE GIDDY LITTLE LADY JANE FIRED A SIMPLE GREEK PHRASE AT TOM
THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH'S QUICK EYE SAW BY THE SERENE BLANKNESS OF THE
TARGET'S FRONT THAT THE SHAFT WAS OVERSHOT SO SHE TRANQUILLY DELIVERED
A RETURN VOLLEY OF SOUNDING GREEK ON TOM'S BEHALF AND THEN STRAIGHTWAY
CHANGED THE TALK TO OTHER MATTERS
TIME WORE ON PLEASANTLY AND LIKEWISE SMOOTHLY ON THE WHOLE
SNAGS AND
SANDBARS GREW LESS AND LESS FREQUENT AND TOM GREW MORE AND MORE AT
HIS EASE SEEING THAT ALL WERE SO LOVINGLY BENT UPON HELPING HIM AND
OVERLOOKING HIS MISTAKES
WHEN IT CAME OUT THAT THE LITTLE LADIES WERE
TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE LORD MAYOR'S BANQUET IN THE EVENING HIS HEART
GAVE A BOUND OF RELIEF AND DELIGHT FOR HE FELT THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE
FRIENDLESS NOW AMONG THAT MULTITUDE OF STRANGERS WHEREAS AN
HOUR EARLIER THE IDEA OF THEIR GOING WITH HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN AN
INSUPPORTABLE TERROR TO HIM
TOM'S GUARDIAN ANGELS THE TWO LORDS HAD HAD LESS COMFORT IN THE
INTERVIEW THAN THE OTHER PARTIES TO IT
THEY FELT MUCH AS IF THEY WERE
PILOTING A GREAT SHIP THROUGH A DANGEROUS CHANNEL THEY WERE ON THE
ALERT CONSTANTLY AND FOUND THEIR OFFICE NO CHILD'S PLAY
WHEREFORE
AT LAST WHEN THE LADIES' VISIT WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE AND THE LORD
GUILFORD DUDLEY WAS ANNOUNCED THEY NOT ONLY FELT THAT THEIR CHARGE HAD
BEEN SUFFICIENTLY TAXED FOR THE PRESENT BUT ALSO THAT THEY THEMSELVES
WERE NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION TO TAKE THEIR SHIP BACK AND MAKE THEIR
ANXIOUS VOYAGE ALL OVER AGAIN
SO THEY RESPECTFULLY ADVISED TOM TO
EXCUSE HIMSELF WHICH HE WAS VERY GLAD TO DO ALTHOUGH A SLIGHT SHADE
OF DISAPPOINTMENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED UPON MY LADY JANE'S FACE WHEN
SHE HEARD THE SPLENDID STRIPLING DENIED ADMITTANCE
THERE WAS A PAUSE NOW A SORT OF WAITING SILENCE WHICH TOM COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND
HE GLANCED AT LORD HERTFORD WHO GAVE HIM A SIGN BUT HE
FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALSO
THE READY ELIZABETH CAME TO THE RESCUE
WITH HER USUAL EASY GRACE
SHE MADE REVERENCE AND SAID
HAVE WE LEAVE OF THE PRINCE'S GRACE MY BROTHER TO GO
TOM SAID
INDEED YOUR LADYSHIPS CAN HAVE WHATSOEVER OF ME THEY WILL FOR THE
ASKING YET WOULD I RATHER GIVE THEM ANY OTHER THING THAT IN MY POOR
POWER LIETH THAN LEAVE TO TAKE THE LIGHT AND BLESSING OF THEIR PRESENCE
HENCE
GIVE YE GOOD DEN AND GOD BE WITH YE THEN HE SMILED INWARDLY
AT THE THOUGHT 'TIS NOT FOR NOUGHT I HAVE DWELT BUT AMONG PRINCES IN
MY READING AND TAUGHT MY TONGUE SOME SLIGHT TRICK OF THEIR BROIDERED
AND GRACIOUS SPEECH WITHAL
WHEN THE ILLUSTRIOUS MAIDENS WERE GONE TOM TURNED WEARILY TO HIS
KEEPERS AND SAID
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIPS TO GRANT ME LEAVE TO GO INTO SOME CORNER
AND REST ME
LORD HERTFORD SAID
SO PLEASE YOUR HIGHNESS IT IS FOR YOU TO COMMAND IT IS FOR US TO
OBEY
THAT THOU SHOULD'ST REST IS INDEED A NEEDFUL THING SINCE THOU
MUST JOURNEY TO THE CITY PRESENTLY
HE TOUCHED A BELL AND A PAGE APPEARED WHO WAS ORDERED TO DESIRE THE
PRESENCE OF SIR WILLIAM HERBERT
THIS GENTLEMAN CAME STRAIGHTWAY AND
CONDUCTED TOM TO AN INNER APARTMENT
TOM'S FIRST MOVEMENT THERE WAS
TO REACH FOR A CUP OF WATER BUT A SILK AND VELVET SERVITOR SEIZED IT
DROPPED UPON ONE KNEE AND OFFERED IT TO HIM ON A GOLDEN SALVER
NEXT THE TIRED CAPTIVE SAT DOWN AND WAS GOING TO TAKE OFF HIS BUSKINS
TIMIDLY ASKING LEAVE WITH HIS EYE BUT ANOTHER SILK AND VELVET
DISCOMFORTER WENT DOWN UPON HIS KNEES AND TOOK THE OFFICE FROM HIM
HE
MADE TWO OR THREE FURTHER EFFORTS TO HELP HIMSELF BUT BEING PROMPTLY
FORESTALLED EACH TIME HE FINALLY GAVE UP WITH A SIGH OF RESIGNATION
AND A MURMURED BESHREW ME BUT I MARVEL THEY DO NOT REQUIRE TO BREATHE
FOR ME ALSO SLIPPERED AND WRAPPED IN A SUMPTUOUS ROBE HE LAID
HIMSELF DOWN AT LAST TO REST BUT NOT TO SLEEP FOR HIS HEAD WAS TOO
FULL OF THOUGHTS AND THE ROOM TOO FULL OF PEOPLE
HE COULD NOT DISMISS
THE FORMER SO THEY STAYED HE DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH TO DISMISS THE
LATTER SO THEY STAYED ALSO TO HIS VAST REGRET AND THEIRS
TOM'S DEPARTURE HAD LEFT HIS TWO NOBLE GUARDIANS ALONE
THEY MUSED A
WHILE WITH MUCH HEAD SHAKING AND WALKING THE FLOOR THEN LORD ST
JOHN
SAID
PLAINLY WHAT DOST THOU THINK
PLAINLY THEN THIS
THE KING IS NEAR HIS END MY NEPHEW IS MAD MAD
WILL MOUNT THE THRONE AND MAD REMAIN
GOD PROTECT ENGLAND SINCE SHE
WILL NEED IT
VERILY IT PROMISETH SO INDEED
BUT
HAVE YOU NO MISGIVINGS AS TO
AS TO
THE SPEAKER HESITATED AND FINALLY STOPPED
HE EVIDENTLY FELT THAT HE
WAS UPON DELICATE GROUND
LORD HERTFORD STOPPED BEFORE HIM LOOKED INTO
HIS FACE WITH A CLEAR FRANK EYE AND SAID
SPEAK ON THERE IS NONE TO HEAR BUT ME
MISGIVINGS AS TO WHAT
I AM FULL LOTH TO WORD THE THING THAT IS IN MY MIND AND THOU SO NEAR
TO HIM IN BLOOD MY LORD
BUT CRAVING PARDON IF I DO OFFEND SEEMETH IT
NOT STRANGE THAT MADNESS COULD SO CHANGE HIS PORT AND MANNER NOT BUT
THAT HIS PORT AND SPEECH ARE PRINCELY STILL BUT THAT THEY DIFFER
IN ONE UNWEIGHTY TRIFLE OR ANOTHER FROM WHAT HIS CUSTOM WAS AFORETIME
SEEMETH IT NOT STRANGE THAT MADNESS SHOULD FILCH FROM HIS MEMORY HIS
FATHER'S VERY LINEAMENTS THE CUSTOMS AND OBSERVANCES THAT ARE HIS DUE
FROM SUCH AS BE ABOUT HIM AND LEAVING HIM HIS LATIN STRIP HIM OF HIS
GREEK AND FRENCH MY LORD BE NOT OFFENDED BUT EASE MY MIND OF ITS
DISQUIET AND RECEIVE MY GRATEFUL THANKS
IT HAUNTETH ME HIS SAYING HE
WAS NOT THE PRINCE AND SO
PEACE MY LORD THOU UTTEREST TREASON HAST FORGOT THE KING'S COMMAND
REMEMBER I AM PARTY TO THY CRIME IF I BUT LISTEN
ST
JOHN PALED AND HASTENED TO SAY
I WAS IN FAULT I DO CONFESS IT
BETRAY ME NOT GRANT ME THIS GRACE
OUT OF THY COURTESY AND I WILL NEITHER THINK NOR SPEAK OF THIS THING
MORE
DEAL NOT HARDLY WITH ME SIR ELSE AM I RUINED
I AM CONTENT MY LORD
SO THOU OFFEND NOT AGAIN HERE OR IN THE
EARS OF OTHERS IT SHALL BE AS THOUGH THOU HADST NOT SPOKEN
BUT THOU
NEED'ST NOT HAVE MISGIVINGS
HE IS MY SISTER'S SON ARE NOT HIS VOICE
HIS FACE HIS FORM FAMILIAR TO ME FROM HIS CRADLE MADNESS CAN DO ALL
THE ODD CONFLICTING THINGS THOU SEEST IN HIM AND MORE
DOST NOT RECALL
HOW THAT THE OLD BARON MARLEY BEING MAD FORGOT THE FAVOUR OF HIS
OWN COUNTENANCE THAT HE HAD KNOWN FOR SIXTY YEARS AND HELD IT WAS
ANOTHER'S NAY EVEN CLAIMED HE WAS THE SON OF MARY MAGDALENE AND THAT
HIS HEAD WAS MADE OF SPANISH GLASS AND SOOTH TO SAY HE SUFFERED NONE
TO TOUCH IT LEST BY MISCHANCE SOME HEEDLESS HAND MIGHT SHIVER IT GIVE
THY MISGIVINGS EASEMENT GOOD MY LORD
THIS IS THE VERY PRINCE I KNOW
HIM WELL AND SOON WILL BE THY KING IT MAY ADVANTAGE THEE TO BEAR THIS
IN MIND AND MORE DWELL UPON IT THAN THE OTHER
AFTER SOME FURTHER TALK IN WHICH THE LORD ST
JOHN COVERED UP HIS
MISTAKE AS WELL AS HE COULD BY REPEATED PROTESTS THAT HIS FAITH WAS
THOROUGHLY GROUNDED NOW AND COULD NOT BE ASSAILED BY DOUBTS AGAIN THE
LORD HERTFORD RELIEVED HIS FELLOW KEEPER AND SAT DOWN TO KEEP WATCH AND
WARD ALONE
HE WAS SOON DEEP IN MEDITATION AND EVIDENTLY THE LONGER HE
THOUGHT THE MORE HE WAS BOTHERED
BY AND BY HE BEGAN TO PACE THE FLOOR
AND MUTTER
TUSH HE MUST BE THE PRINCE WILL ANY BE IN ALL THE LAND MAINTAIN
THERE CAN BE TWO NOT OF ONE BLOOD AND BIRTH SO MARVELLOUSLY TWINNED
AND EVEN WERE IT SO 'TWERE YET A STRANGER MIRACLE THAT CHANCE SHOULD
CAST THE ONE INTO THE OTHER'S PLACE
NAY 'TIS FOLLY FOLLY FOLLY
PRESENTLY HE SAID
NOW WERE HE IMPOSTOR AND CALLED HIMSELF PRINCE LOOK YOU THAT WOULD
BE NATURAL THAT WOULD BE REASONABLE
BUT LIVED EVER AN IMPOSTOR YET
WHO BEING CALLED PRINCE BY THE KING PRINCE BY THE COURT PRINCE BY
ALL DENIED HIS DIGNITY AND PLEADED AGAINST HIS EXALTATION NO BY
THE SOUL OF ST
SWITHIN NO THIS IS THE TRUE PRINCE GONE MAD
CHAPTER VII
TOM'S FIRST ROYAL DINNER
SOMEWHAT AFTER ONE IN THE AFTERNOON TOM RESIGNEDLY UNDERWENT THE ORDEAL
OF BEING DRESSED FOR DINNER
HE FOUND HIMSELF AS FINELY CLOTHED AS
BEFORE BUT EVERYTHING DIFFERENT EVERYTHING CHANGED FROM HIS RUFF TO
HIS STOCKINGS
HE WAS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED WITH MUCH STATE TO A SPACIOUS
AND ORNATE APARTMENT WHERE A TABLE WAS ALREADY SET FOR ONE
ITS
FURNITURE WAS ALL OF MASSY GOLD AND BEAUTIFIED WITH DESIGNS WHICH
WELL NIGH MADE IT PRICELESS SINCE THEY WERE THE WORK OF BENVENUTO
THE
ROOM WAS HALF FILLED WITH NOBLE SERVITORS
A CHAPLAIN SAID GRACE AND
TOM WAS ABOUT TO FALL TO FOR HUNGER HAD LONG BEEN CONSTITUTIONAL WITH
HIM BUT WAS INTERRUPTED BY MY LORD THE EARL OF BERKELEY WHO FASTENED A
NAPKIN ABOUT HIS NECK FOR THE GREAT POST OF DIAPERERS TO THE PRINCE
OF WALES WAS HEREDITARY IN THIS NOBLEMAN'S FAMILY
TOM'S CUPBEARER WAS
PRESENT AND FORESTALLED ALL HIS ATTEMPTS TO HELP HIMSELF TO WINE
THE
TASTER TO HIS HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES WAS THERE ALSO PREPARED TO
TASTE ANY SUSPICIOUS DISH UPON REQUIREMENT AND RUN THE RISK OF BEING
POISONED
HE WAS ONLY AN ORNAMENTAL APPENDAGE AT THIS TIME AND WAS
SELDOM CALLED UPON TO EXERCISE HIS FUNCTION BUT THERE HAD BEEN TIMES
NOT MANY GENERATIONS PAST WHEN THE OFFICE OF TASTER HAD ITS PERILS
AND WAS NOT A GRANDEUR TO BE DESIRED
WHY THEY DID NOT USE A DOG OR A
PLUMBER SEEMS STRANGE BUT ALL THE WAYS OF ROYALTY ARE STRANGE
MY
LORD D'ARCY FIRST GROOM OF THE CHAMBER WAS THERE TO DO GOODNESS KNOWS
WHAT BUT THERE HE WAS LET THAT SUFFICE
THE LORD CHIEF BUTLER WAS
THERE AND STOOD BEHIND TOM'S CHAIR OVERSEEING THE SOLEMNITIES UNDER
COMMAND OF THE LORD GREAT STEWARD AND THE LORD HEAD COOK WHO STOOD
NEAR
TOM HAD THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR SERVANTS BESIDE THESE
BUT THEY WERE NOT ALL IN THAT ROOM OF COURSE NOR THE QUARTER OF THEM
NEITHER WAS TOM AWARE YET THAT THEY EXISTED
ALL THOSE THAT WERE PRESENT HAD BEEN WELL DRILLED WITHIN THE HOUR TO
REMEMBER THAT THE PRINCE WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF HIS HEAD AND TO BE
CAREFUL TO SHOW NO SURPRISE AT HIS VAGARIES
THESE 'VAGARIES' WERE
SOON ON EXHIBITION BEFORE THEM BUT THEY ONLY MOVED THEIR COMPASSION AND
THEIR SORROW NOT THEIR MIRTH
IT WAS A HEAVY AFFLICTION TO THEM TO SEE
THE BELOVED PRINCE SO STRICKEN
POOR TOM ATE WITH HIS FINGERS MAINLY BUT NO ONE SMILED AT IT OR EVEN
SEEMED TO OBSERVE IT
HE INSPECTED HIS NAPKIN CURIOUSLY AND WITH DEEP
INTEREST FOR IT WAS OF A VERY DAINTY AND BEAUTIFUL FABRIC THEN SAID
WITH SIMPLICITY
PRITHEE TAKE IT AWAY LEST IN MINE UNHEEDFULNESS IT BE SOILED
THE HEREDITARY DIAPERER TOOK IT AWAY WITH REVERENT MANNER AND WITHOUT
WORD OR PROTEST OF ANY SORT
TOM EXAMINED THE TURNIPS AND THE LETTUCE WITH INTEREST AND ASKED WHAT
THEY WERE AND IF THEY WERE TO BE EATEN FOR IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY THAT
MEN HAD BEGUN TO RAISE THESE THINGS IN ENGLAND IN PLACE OF IMPORTING
THEM AS LUXURIES FROM HOLLAND
1 HIS QUESTION WAS ANSWERED WITH GRAVE
RESPECT AND NO SURPRISE MANIFESTED
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS DESSERT
HE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH NUTS BUT NOBODY APPEARED TO BE AWARE OF IT
OR DISTURBED BY IT
BUT THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS HIMSELF DISTURBED BY
IT AND SHOWED DISCOMPOSURE FOR THIS WAS THE ONLY SERVICE HE HAD BEEN
PERMITTED TO DO WITH HIS OWN HANDS DURING THE MEAL AND HE DID NOT DOUBT
THAT HE HAD DONE A MOST IMPROPER AND UNPRINCELY THING
AT THAT MOMENT
THE MUSCLES OF HIS NOSE BEGAN TO TWITCH AND THE END OF THAT ORGAN TO
LIFT AND WRINKLE
THIS CONTINUED AND TOM BEGAN TO EVINCE A GROWING
DISTRESS
HE LOOKED APPEALINGLY FIRST AT ONE AND THEN ANOTHER OF THE
LORDS ABOUT HIM AND TEARS CAME INTO HIS EYES
THEY SPRANG FORWARD WITH
DISMAY IN THEIR FACES AND BEGGED TO KNOW HIS TROUBLE
TOM SAID WITH
GENUINE ANGUISH
I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE MY NOSE ITCHETH CRUELLY
WHAT IS THE CUSTOM
AND USAGE IN THIS EMERGENCE PRITHEE SPEED FOR 'TIS BUT A LITTLE TIME
THAT I CAN BEAR IT
NONE SMILED BUT ALL WERE SORE PERPLEXED AND LOOKED ONE TO THE OTHER
IN DEEP TRIBULATION FOR COUNSEL
BUT BEHOLD HERE WAS A DEAD WALL AND
NOTHING IN ENGLISH HISTORY TO TELL HOW TO GET OVER IT
THE MASTER OF
CEREMONIES WAS NOT PRESENT THERE WAS NO ONE WHO FELT SAFE TO VENTURE
UPON THIS UNCHARTED SEA OR RISK THE ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THIS SOLEMN
PROBLEM
ALAS THERE WAS NO HEREDITARY SCRATCHER
MEANTIME THE TEARS
HAD OVERFLOWED THEIR BANKS AND BEGUN TO TRICKLE DOWN TOM'S CHEEKS
HIS
TWITCHING NOSE WAS PLEADING MORE URGENTLY THAN EVER FOR RELIEF
AT LAST
NATURE BROKE DOWN THE BARRIERS OF ETIQUETTE TOM LIFTED UP AN INWARD
PRAYER FOR PARDON IF HE WAS DOING WRONG AND BROUGHT RELIEF TO THE
BURDENED HEARTS OF HIS COURT BY SCRATCHING HIS NOSE HIMSELF
HIS MEAL BEING ENDED A LORD CAME AND HELD BEFORE HIM A BROAD SHALLOW
GOLDEN DISH WITH FRAGRANT ROSEWATER IN IT TO CLEANSE HIS MOUTH AND
FINGERS WITH AND MY LORD THE HEREDITARY DIAPERER STOOD BY WITH A NAPKIN
FOR HIS USE
TOM GAZED AT THE DISH A PUZZLED MOMENT OR TWO THEN RAISED
IT TO HIS LIPS AND GRAVELY TOOK A DRAUGHT
THEN HE RETURNED IT TO THE
WAITING LORD AND SAID
NAY IT LIKES ME NOT MY LORD IT HATH A PRETTY FLAVOUR BUT IT
WANTETH STRENGTH
THIS NEW ECCENTRICITY OF THE PRINCE'S RUINED MIND MADE ALL THE HEARTS
ABOUT HIM ACHE BUT THE SAD SIGHT MOVED NONE TO MERRIMENT
TOM'S NEXT UNCONSCIOUS BLUNDER WAS TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE TABLE
JUST WHEN THE CHAPLAIN HAD TAKEN HIS STAND BEHIND HIS CHAIR AND WITH
UPLIFTED HANDS AND CLOSED UPLIFTED EYES WAS IN THE ACT OF BEGINNING
THE BLESSING
STILL NOBODY SEEMED TO PERCEIVE THAT THE PRINCE HAD DONE
A THING UNUSUAL
BY HIS OWN REQUEST OUR SMALL FRIEND WAS NOW CONDUCTED TO HIS PRIVATE
CABINET AND LEFT THERE ALONE TO HIS OWN DEVICES
HANGING UPON HOOKS IN
THE OAKEN WAINSCOTING WERE THE SEVERAL PIECES OF A SUIT OF SHINING STEEL
ARMOUR COVERED ALL OVER WITH BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS EXQUISITELY INLAID
IN GOLD
THIS MARTIAL PANOPLY BELONGED TO THE TRUE PRINCE A RECENT
PRESENT FROM MADAM PARR THE QUEEN
TOM PUT ON THE GREAVES THE
GAUNTLETS THE PLUMED HELMET AND SUCH OTHER PIECES AS HE COULD DON
WITHOUT ASSISTANCE AND FOR A WHILE WAS MINDED TO CALL FOR HELP AND
COMPLETE THE MATTER BUT BETHOUGHT HIM OF THE NUTS HE HAD BROUGHT AWAY
FROM DINNER AND THE JOY IT WOULD BE TO EAT THEM WITH NO CROWD TO EYE
HIM AND NO GRAND HEREDITARIES TO PESTER HIM WITH UNDESIRED SERVICES
SO HE RESTORED THE PRETTY THINGS TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES AND SOON WAS
CRACKING NUTS AND FEELING ALMOST NATURALLY HAPPY FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE GOD FOR HIS SINS HAD MADE HIM A PRINCE
WHEN THE NUTS WERE ALL
GONE HE STUMBLED UPON SOME INVITING BOOKS IN A CLOSET AMONG THEM ONE
ABOUT THE ETIQUETTE OF THE ENGLISH COURT
THIS WAS A PRIZE
HE LAY DOWN
UPON A SUMPTUOUS DIVAN AND PROCEEDED TO INSTRUCT HIMSELF WITH HONEST
ZEAL
LET US LEAVE HIM THERE FOR THE PRESENT
CHAPTER VIII
THE QUESTION OF THE SEAL
ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK HENRY VIII
AWOKE OUT OF AN UNREFRESHING NAP AND
MUTTERED TO HIMSELF TROUBLOUS DREAMS TROUBLOUS DREAMS MINE END IS
NOW AT HAND SO SAY THESE WARNINGS AND MY FAILING PULSES DO CONFIRM
IT PRESENTLY A WICKED LIGHT FLAMED UP IN HIS EYE AND HE MUTTERED

PLEASURE CONCERNING THE LORD CHANCELLOR WHO WAS WAITING WITHOUT
ADMIT HIM ADMIT HIM EXCLAIMED THE KING EAGERLY
THE LORD CHANCELLOR ENTERED AND KNELT BY THE KING'S COUCH SAYING
I HAVE GIVEN ORDER AND ACCORDING TO THE KING'S COMMAND THE PEERS OF
THE REALM IN THEIR ROBES DO NOW STAND AT THE BAR OF THE HOUSE WHERE
HAVING CONFIRMED THE DUKE OF NORFOLK'S DOOM THEY HUMBLY WAIT HIS
MAJESTY'S FURTHER PLEASURE IN THE MATTER
THE KING'S FACE LIT UP WITH A FIERCE JOY
SAID HE
LIFT ME UP IN MINE OWN PERSON WILL I GO BEFORE MY PARLIAMENT AND
WITH MINE OWN HAND WILL I SEAL THE WARRANT THAT RIDS ME OF
HIS VOICE FAILED AN ASHEN PALLOR SWEPT THE FLUSH FROM HIS CHEEKS AND
THE ATTENDANTS EASED HIM BACK UPON HIS PILLOWS AND HURRIEDLY ASSISTED
HIM WITH RESTORATIVES
PRESENTLY HE SAID SORROWFULLY
ALACK HOW HAVE I LONGED FOR THIS SWEET HOUR AND LO TOO LATE IT
COMETH AND I AM ROBBED OF THIS SO COVETED CHANCE
BUT SPEED YE SPEED
YE LET OTHERS DO THIS HAPPY OFFICE SITH 'TIS DENIED TO ME
I PUT MY
GREAT SEAL IN COMMISSION CHOOSE THOU THE LORDS THAT SHALL COMPOSE IT
AND GET YE TO YOUR WORK
SPEED YE MAN BEFORE THE SUN SHALL RISE AND
SET AGAIN BRING ME HIS HEAD THAT I MAY SEE IT
ACCORDING TO THE KING'S COMMAND SO SHALL IT BE
WILL'T PLEASE YOUR
MAJESTY TO ORDER THAT THE SEAL BE NOW RESTORED TO ME SO THAT I MAY
FORTH UPON THE BUSINESS
THE SEAL WHO KEEPETH THE SEAL BUT THOU
PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY YOU DID TAKE IT FROM ME TWO DAYS SINCE SAYING IT
SHOULD NO MORE DO ITS OFFICE TILL YOUR OWN ROYAL HAND SHOULD USE IT UPON
THE DUKE OF NORFOLK'S WARRANT
WHY SO IN SOOTH I DID I DO REMEMBER
WHAT DID I WITH IT
I AM VERY FEEBLE
SO OFT THESE DAYS DOTH MY MEMORY PLAY THE
TRAITOR WITH ME
'TIS STRANGE STRANGE
THE KING DROPPED INTO INARTICULATE MUMBLINGS SHAKING HIS GREY HEAD
WEAKLY FROM TIME TO TIME AND GROPINGLY TRYING TO RECOLLECT WHAT HE
HAD DONE WITH THE SEAL
AT LAST MY LORD HERTFORD VENTURED TO KNEEL AND
OFFER INFORMATION
SIRE IF THAT I MAY BE SO BOLD HERE BE SEVERAL THAT DO REMEMBER WITH
ME HOW THAT YOU GAVE THE GREAT SEAL INTO THE HANDS OF HIS HIGHNESS THE
PRINCE OF WALES TO KEEP AGAINST THE DAY THAT
TRUE MOST TRUE INTERRUPTED THE KING
FETCH IT GO TIME FLIETH
LORD HERTFORD FLEW TO TOM BUT RETURNED TO THE KING BEFORE VERY LONG
TROUBLED AND EMPTY HANDED
HE DELIVERED HIMSELF TO THIS EFFECT
IT GRIEVETH ME MY LORD THE KING TO BEAR SO HEAVY AND UNWELCOME
TIDINGS BUT IT IS THE WILL OF GOD THAT THE PRINCE'S AFFLICTION ABIDETH
STILL AND HE CANNOT RECALL TO MIND THAT HE RECEIVED THE SEAL
SO CAME
I QUICKLY TO REPORT THINKING IT WERE WASTE OF PRECIOUS TIME AND
LITTLE WORTH WITHAL THAT ANY SHOULD ATTEMPT TO SEARCH THE LONG ARRAY OF
CHAMBERS AND SALOONS THAT BELONG UNTO HIS ROYAL HIGH
A GROAN FROM THE KING INTERRUPTED THE LORD AT THIS POINT
AFTER A
LITTLE WHILE HIS MAJESTY SAID WITH A DEEP SADNESS IN HIS TONE
TROUBLE HIM NO MORE POOR CHILD
THE HAND OF GOD LIETH HEAVY UPON HIM
AND MY HEART GOETH OUT IN LOVING COMPASSION FOR HIM AND SORROW THAT I
MAY NOT BEAR HIS BURDEN ON MINE OLD TROUBLE WEIGHTED SHOULDERS AND SO
BRING HIM PEACE
HE CLOSED HIS EYES FELL TO MUMBLING AND PRESENTLY WAS SILENT
AFTER
A TIME HE OPENED HIS EYES AGAIN AND GAZED VACANTLY AROUND UNTIL HIS
GLANCE RESTED UPON THE KNEELING LORD CHANCELLOR
INSTANTLY HIS FACE
FLUSHED WITH WRATH
WHAT THOU HERE YET BY THE GLORY OF GOD AN' THOU GETTEST NOT ABOUT
THAT TRAITOR'S BUSINESS THY MITRE SHALL HAVE HOLIDAY THE MORROW FOR
LACK OF A HEAD TO GRACE WITHAL
THE TREMBLING CHANCELLOR ANSWERED
GOOD YOUR MAJESTY I CRY YOU MERCY I BUT WAITED FOR THE SEAL
MAN HAST LOST THY WITS THE SMALL SEAL WHICH AFORETIME I WAS WONT
TO TAKE WITH ME ABROAD LIETH IN MY TREASURY
AND SINCE THE GREAT SEAL
HATH FLOWN AWAY SHALL NOT IT SUFFICE HAST LOST THY WITS BEGONE
AND HARK YE COME NO MORE TILL THOU DO BRING HIS HEAD
THE POOR CHANCELLOR WAS NOT LONG IN REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THIS DANGEROUS
VICINITY NOR DID THE COMMISSION WASTE TIME IN GIVING THE ROYAL ASSENT
TO THE WORK OF THE SLAVISH PARLIAMENT AND APPOINTING THE MORROW FOR THE
BEHEADING OF THE PREMIER PEER OF ENGLAND THE LUCKLESS DUKE OF NORFOLK
CHAPTER IX
THE RIVER PAGEANT
AT NINE IN THE EVENING THE WHOLE VAST RIVER FRONT OF THE PALACE WAS
BLAZING WITH LIGHT
THE RIVER ITSELF AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH
CITYWARDS WAS SO THICKLY COVERED WITH WATERMEN'S BOATS AND WITH
PLEASURE BARGES ALL FRINGED WITH COLOURED LANTERNS AND GENTLY AGITATED
BY THE WAVES THAT IT RESEMBLED A GLOWING AND LIMITLESS GARDEN OF
FLOWERS STIRRED TO SOFT MOTION BY SUMMER WINDS
THE GRAND TERRACE OF
STONE STEPS LEADING DOWN TO THE WATER SPACIOUS ENOUGH TO MASS THE ARMY
OF A GERMAN PRINCIPALITY UPON WAS A PICTURE TO SEE WITH ITS RANKS
OF ROYAL HALBERDIERS IN POLISHED ARMOUR AND ITS TROOPS OF BRILLIANTLY
COSTUMED SERVITORS FLITTING UP AND DOWN AND TO AND FRO IN THE HURRY OF
PREPARATION
PRESENTLY A COMMAND WAS GIVEN AND IMMEDIATELY ALL LIVING CREATURES
VANISHED FROM THE STEPS
NOW THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE HUSH OF
SUSPENSE AND EXPECTANCY
AS FAR AS ONE'S VISION COULD CARRY HE MIGHT
SEE THE MYRIADS OF PEOPLE IN THE BOATS RISE UP AND SHADE THEIR EYES
FROM THE GLARE OF LANTERNS AND TORCHES AND GAZE TOWARD THE PALACE
A FILE OF FORTY OR FIFTY STATE BARGES DREW UP TO THE STEPS
THEY WERE
RICHLY GILT AND THEIR LOFTY PROWS AND STERNS WERE ELABORATELY CARVED
SOME OF THEM WERE DECORATED WITH BANNERS AND STREAMERS SOME WITH
CLOTH OF GOLD AND ARRAS EMBROIDERED WITH COATS OF ARMS OTHERS WITH
SILKEN FLAGS THAT HAD NUMBERLESS LITTLE SILVER BELLS FASTENED TO THEM
WHICH SHOOK OUT TINY SHOWERS OF JOYOUS MUSIC WHENEVER THE BREEZES
FLUTTERED THEM OTHERS OF YET HIGHER PRETENSIONS SINCE THEY BELONGED TO
NOBLES IN THE PRINCE'S IMMEDIATE SERVICE HAD THEIR SIDES PICTURESQUELY
FENCED WITH SHIELDS GORGEOUSLY EMBLAZONED WITH ARMORIAL BEARINGS
EACH
STATE BARGE WAS TOWED BY A TENDER
BESIDES THE ROWERS THESE TENDERS
CARRIED EACH A NUMBER OF MEN AT ARMS IN GLOSSY HELMET AND BREASTPLATE
AND A COMPANY OF MUSICIANS
THE ADVANCE GUARD OF THE EXPECTED PROCESSION NOW APPEARED IN THE GREAT
GATEWAY A TROOP OF HALBERDIERS
'THEY WERE DRESSED IN STRIPED HOSE OF
BLACK AND TAWNY VELVET CAPS GRACED AT THE SIDES WITH SILVER ROSES AND
DOUBLETS OF MURREY AND BLUE CLOTH EMBROIDERED ON THE FRONT AND BACK
WITH THE THREE FEATHERS THE PRINCE'S BLAZON WOVEN IN GOLD
THEIR
HALBERD STAVES WERE COVERED WITH CRIMSON VELVET FASTENED WITH GILT
NAILS AND ORNAMENTED WITH GOLD TASSELS
FILING OFF ON THE RIGHT AND
LEFT THEY FORMED TWO LONG LINES EXTENDING FROM THE GATEWAY OF THE
PALACE TO THE WATER'S EDGE
A THICK RAYED CLOTH OR CARPET WAS
THEN UNFOLDED AND LAID DOWN BETWEEN THEM BY ATTENDANTS IN THE
GOLD AND CRIMSON LIVERIES OF THE PRINCE
THIS DONE A FLOURISH OF
TRUMPETS RESOUNDED FROM WITHIN
A LIVELY PRELUDE AROSE FROM THE
MUSICIANS ON THE WATER AND TWO USHERS WITH WHITE WANDS MARCHED WITH A
SLOW AND STATELY PACE FROM THE PORTAL
THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY AN OFFICER
BEARING THE CIVIC MACE AFTER WHOM CAME ANOTHER CARRYING THE CITY'S
SWORD THEN SEVERAL SERGEANTS OF THE CITY GUARD IN THEIR FULL
ACCOUTREMENTS AND WITH BADGES ON THEIR SLEEVES THEN THE GARTER
KING AT ARMS IN HIS TABARD THEN SEVERAL KNIGHTS OF THE BATH EACH WITH
A WHITE LACE ON HIS SLEEVE THEN THEIR ESQUIRES THEN THE JUDGES IN
THEIR ROBES OF SCARLET AND COIFS THEN THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF
ENGLAND IN A ROBE OF SCARLET OPEN BEFORE AND PURFLED WITH MINEVER
THEN A DEPUTATION OF ALDERMEN IN THEIR SCARLET CLOAKS AND THEN THE
HEADS OF THE DIFFERENT CIVIC COMPANIES IN THEIR ROBES OF STATE
NOW
CAME TWELVE FRENCH GENTLEMEN IN SPLENDID HABILIMENTS CONSISTING OF
POURPOINTS OF WHITE DAMASK BARRED WITH GOLD SHORT MANTLES OF
CRIMSON VELVET LINED WITH VIOLET TAFFETA AND CARNATION COLOURED
HAUTS DE CHAUSSES AND TOOK THEIR WAY DOWN THE STEPS
THEY WERE OF THE
SUITE OF THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR AND WERE FOLLOWED BY TWELVE CAVALIERS OF
THE SUITE OF THE SPANISH AMBASSADOR CLOTHED IN BLACK VELVET UNRELIEVED
BY ANY ORNAMENT
FOLLOWING THESE CAME SEVERAL GREAT ENGLISH NOBLES WITH
THEIR ATTENDANTS
THERE WAS A FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS WITHIN AND THE PRINCE'S UNCLE THE
FUTURE GREAT DUKE OF SOMERSET EMERGED FROM THE GATEWAY ARRAYED IN A
'DOUBLET OF BLACK CLOTH OF GOLD AND A CLOAK OF CRIMSON SATIN FLOWERED
WITH GOLD AND RIBANDED WITH NETS OF SILVER HE TURNED DOFFED
HIS PLUMED CAP BENT HIS BODY IN A LOW REVERENCE AND BEGAN TO STEP
BACKWARD BOWING AT EACH STEP
A PROLONGED TRUMPET BLAST FOLLOWED AND
A PROCLAMATION WAY FOR THE HIGH AND MIGHTY THE LORD EDWARD PRINCE OF
WALES HIGH ALOFT ON THE PALACE WALLS A LONG LINE OF RED TONGUES OF
FLAME LEAPT FORTH WITH A THUNDER CRASH THE MASSED WORLD ON THE RIVER
BURST INTO A MIGHTY ROAR OF WELCOME AND TOM CANTY THE CAUSE AND HERO
OF IT ALL STEPPED INTO VIEW AND SLIGHTLY BOWED HIS PRINCELY HEAD
HE WAS 'MAGNIFICENTLY HABITED IN A DOUBLET OF WHITE SATIN WITH A
FRONT PIECE OF PURPLE CLOTH OF TISSUE POWDERED WITH DIAMONDS AND EDGED
WITH ERMINE
OVER THIS HE WORE A MANTLE OF WHITE CLOTH OF GOLD POUNCED
WITH THE TRIPLE FEATHERED CREST LINED WITH BLUE SATIN SET WITH PEARLS
AND PRECIOUS STONES AND FASTENED WITH A CLASP OF BRILLIANTS
ABOUT HIS
NECK HUNG THE ORDER OF THE GARTER AND SEVERAL PRINCELY FOREIGN ORDERS
AND WHEREVER LIGHT FELL UPON HIM JEWELS RESPONDED WITH A BLINDING FLASH
O TOM CANTY BORN IN A HOVEL BRED IN THE GUTTERS OF LONDON FAMILIAR
WITH RAGS AND DIRT AND MISERY WHAT A SPECTACLE IS THIS
CHAPTER X
THE PRINCE IN THE TOILS
WE LEFT JOHN CANTY DRAGGING THE RIGHTFUL PRINCE INTO OFFAL COURT WITH
A NOISY AND DELIGHTED MOB AT HIS HEELS
THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON IN IT
WHO OFFERED A PLEADING WORD FOR THE CAPTIVE AND HE WAS NOT HEEDED HE
WAS HARDLY EVEN HEARD SO GREAT WAS THE TURMOIL
THE PRINCE CONTINUED
TO STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM AND TO RAGE AGAINST THE TREATMENT HE WAS
SUFFERING UNTIL JOHN CANTY LOST WHAT LITTLE PATIENCE WAS LEFT IN HIM
AND RAISED HIS OAKEN CUDGEL IN A SUDDEN FURY OVER THE PRINCE'S HEAD
THE SINGLE PLEADER FOR THE LAD SPRANG TO STOP THE MAN'S ARM AND THE
BLOW DESCENDED UPON HIS OWN WRIST
CANTY ROARED OUT
THOU'LT MEDDLE WILT THOU THEN HAVE THY REWARD
HIS CUDGEL CRASHED DOWN UPON THE MEDDLER'S HEAD THERE WAS A GROAN A
DIM FORM SANK TO THE GROUND AMONG THE FEET OF THE CROWD AND THE NEXT
MOMENT IT LAY THERE IN THE DARK ALONE
THE MOB PRESSED ON THEIR
ENJOYMENT NOTHING DISTURBED BY THIS EPISODE
PRESENTLY THE PRINCE FOUND HIMSELF IN JOHN CANTY'S ABODE WITH THE DOOR
CLOSED AGAINST THE OUTSIDERS
BY THE VAGUE LIGHT OF A TALLOW CANDLE
WHICH WAS THRUST INTO A BOTTLE HE MADE OUT THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE
LOATHSOME DEN AND ALSO THE OCCUPANTS OF IT
TWO FROWSY GIRLS AND
A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN COWERED AGAINST THE WALL IN ONE CORNER WITH THE
ASPECT OF ANIMALS HABITUATED TO HARSH USAGE AND EXPECTING AND DREADING
IT NOW
FROM ANOTHER CORNER STOLE A WITHERED HAG WITH STREAMING GREY
HAIR AND MALIGNANT EYES
JOHN CANTY SAID TO THIS ONE
TARRY THERE'S FINE MUMMERIES HERE
MAR THEM NOT TILL THOU'ST ENJOYED
THEM THEN LET THY HAND BE HEAVY AS THOU WILT
STAND FORTH LAD
NOW
SAY THY FOOLERY AGAIN AN THOU'ST NOT FORGOT IT
NAME THY NAME
WHO ART
THOU
THE INSULTED BLOOD MOUNTED TO THE LITTLE PRINCE'S CHEEK ONCE MORE AND
HE LIFTED A STEADY AND INDIGNANT GAZE TO THE MAN'S FACE AND SAID
'TIS BUT ILL BREEDING IN SUCH AS THOU TO COMMAND ME TO SPEAK
I TELL
THEE NOW AS I TOLD THEE BEFORE I AM EDWARD PRINCE OF WALES AND NONE
OTHER
THE STUNNING SURPRISE OF THIS REPLY NAILED THE HAG'S FEET TO THE FLOOR
WHERE SHE STOOD AND ALMOST TOOK HER BREATH
SHE STARED AT THE PRINCE
IN STUPID AMAZEMENT WHICH SO AMUSED HER RUFFIANLY SON THAT HE BURST
INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER
BUT THE EFFECT UPON TOM CANTY'S MOTHER AND
SISTERS WAS DIFFERENT
THEIR DREAD OF BODILY INJURY GAVE WAY AT ONCE TO
DISTRESS OF A DIFFERENT SORT
THEY RAN FORWARD WITH WOE AND DISMAY IN
THEIR FACES EXCLAIMING
OH POOR TOM POOR LAD
THE MOTHER FELL ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE PRINCE PUT HER HANDS UPON HIS
SHOULDERS AND GAZED YEARNINGLY INTO HIS FACE THROUGH HER RISING TEARS
THEN SHE SAID
OH MY POOR BOY THY FOOLISH READING HATH WROUGHT ITS WOEFUL WORK AT
LAST AND TA'EN THY WIT AWAY
AH WHY DID'ST THOU CLEAVE TO IT WHEN I
SO WARNED THEE 'GAINST IT THOU'ST BROKE THY MOTHER'S HEART
THE PRINCE LOOKED INTO HER FACE AND SAID GENTLY
THY SON IS WELL AND HATH NOT LOST HIS WITS GOOD DAME
COMFORT THEE
LET ME TO THE PALACE WHERE HE IS AND STRAIGHTWAY WILL THE KING MY
FATHER RESTORE HIM TO THEE
THE KING THY FATHER OH MY CHILD UNSAY THESE WORDS THAT BE FREIGHTED
WITH DEATH FOR THEE AND RUIN FOR ALL THAT BE NEAR TO THEE
SHAKE OF
THIS GRUESOME DREAM
CALL BACK THY POOR WANDERING MEMORY
LOOK UPON
ME
AM NOT I THY MOTHER THAT BORE THEE AND LOVETH THEE
THE PRINCE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND RELUCTANTLY SAID
GOD KNOWETH I AM LOTH TO GRIEVE THY HEART BUT TRULY HAVE I NEVER
LOOKED UPON THY FACE BEFORE
THE WOMAN SANK BACK TO A SITTING POSTURE ON THE FLOOR AND COVERING HER
EYES WITH HER HANDS GAVE WAY TO HEART BROKEN SOBS AND WAILINGS
LET THE SHOW GO ON SHOUTED CANTY
WHAT NAN WHAT BET MANNERLESS
WENCHES WILL YE STAND IN THE PRINCE'S PRESENCE UPON YOUR KNEES YE
PAUPER SCUM AND DO HIM REVERENCE
HE FOLLOWED THIS WITH ANOTHER HORSE LAUGH
THE GIRLS BEGAN TO PLEAD
TIMIDLY FOR THEIR BROTHER AND NAN SAID
AN THOU WILT BUT LET HIM TO BED FATHER REST AND SLEEP WILL HEAL HIS
MADNESS PRITHEE DO
DO FATHER SAID BET HE IS MORE WORN THAN IS HIS WONT
TO MORROW
WILL HE BE HIMSELF AGAIN AND WILL BEG WITH DILIGENCE AND COME NOT
EMPTY HOME AGAIN
THIS REMARK SOBERED THE FATHER'S JOVIALITY AND BROUGHT HIS MIND TO
BUSINESS
HE TURNED ANGRILY UPON THE PRINCE AND SAID
THE MORROW MUST WE PAY TWO PENNIES TO HIM THAT OWNS THIS HOLE TWO
PENNIES MARK YE ALL THIS MONEY FOR A HALF YEAR'S RENT ELSE OUT OF
THIS WE GO
SHOW WHAT THOU'ST GATHERED WITH THY LAZY BEGGING
THE PRINCE SAID
OFFEND ME NOT WITH THY SORDID MATTERS
I TELL THEE AGAIN I AM THE
KING'S SON
A SOUNDING BLOW UPON THE PRINCE'S SHOULDER FROM CANTY'S BROAD PALM
SENT HIM STAGGERING INTO GOODWIFE CANTY'S ARMS WHO CLASPED HIM TO HER
BREAST AND SHELTERED HIM FROM A PELTING RAIN OF CUFFS AND SLAPS BY
INTERPOSING HER OWN PERSON
THE FRIGHTENED GIRLS RETREATED TO THEIR
CORNER BUT THE GRANDMOTHER STEPPED EAGERLY FORWARD TO ASSIST HER SON
THE PRINCE SPRANG AWAY FROM MRS
CANTY EXCLAIMING
THOU SHALT NOT SUFFER FOR ME MADAM
LET THESE SWINE DO THEIR WILL
UPON ME ALONE
THIS SPEECH INFURIATED THE SWINE TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT THEY SET ABOUT
THEIR WORK WITHOUT WASTE OF TIME
BETWEEN THEM THEY BELABOURED THE BOY
RIGHT SOUNDLY AND THEN GAVE THE GIRLS AND THEIR MOTHER A BEATING FOR
SHOWING SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIM
NOW SAID CANTY TO BED ALL OF YE
THE ENTERTAINMENT HAS TIRED ME
THE LIGHT WAS PUT OUT AND THE FAMILY RETIRED
AS SOON AS THE SNORINGS
OF THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE AND HIS MOTHER SHOWED THAT THEY WERE ASLEEP
THE YOUNG GIRLS CREPT TO WHERE THE PRINCE LAY AND COVERED HIM TENDERLY
FROM THE COLD WITH STRAW AND RAGS AND THEIR MOTHER CREPT TO HIM ALSO
AND STROKED HIS HAIR AND CRIED OVER HIM WHISPERING BROKEN WORDS OF
COMFORT AND COMPASSION IN HIS EAR THE WHILE
SHE HAD SAVED A MORSEL FOR
HIM TO EAT ALSO BUT THE BOY'S PAINS HAD SWEPT AWAY ALL APPETITE AT
LEAST FOR BLACK AND TASTELESS CRUSTS
HE WAS TOUCHED BY HER BRAVE AND
COSTLY DEFENCE OF HIM AND BY HER COMMISERATION AND HE THANKED HER IN
VERY NOBLE AND PRINCELY WORDS AND BEGGED HER TO GO TO HER SLEEP AND TRY
TO FORGET HER SORROWS
AND HE ADDED THAT THE KING HIS FATHER WOULD NOT
LET HER LOYAL KINDNESS AND DEVOTION GO UNREWARDED
THIS RETURN TO HIS
'MADNESS' BROKE HER HEART ANEW AND SHE STRAINED HIM TO HER BREAST AGAIN
AND AGAIN AND THEN WENT BACK DROWNED IN TEARS TO HER BED
AS SHE LAY THINKING AND MOURNING THE SUGGESTION BEGAN TO CREEP INTO
HER MIND THAT THERE WAS AN UNDEFINABLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BOY THAT WAS
LACKING IN TOM CANTY MAD OR SANE
SHE COULD NOT DESCRIBE IT SHE COULD
NOT TELL JUST WHAT IT WAS AND YET HER SHARP MOTHER INSTINCT SEEMED TO
DETECT IT AND PERCEIVE IT
WHAT IF THE BOY WERE REALLY NOT HER SON
AFTER ALL OH ABSURD SHE ALMOST SMILED AT THE IDEA SPITE OF HER
GRIEFS AND TROUBLES
NO MATTER SHE FOUND THAT IT WAS AN IDEA THAT
WOULD NOT 'DOWN BUT PERSISTED IN HAUNTING HER
IT PURSUED HER IT
HARASSED HER IT CLUNG TO HER AND REFUSED TO BE PUT AWAY OR IGNORED
AT LAST SHE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ANY PEACE FOR HER
UNTIL SHE SHOULD DEVISE A TEST THAT SHOULD PROVE CLEARLY AND WITHOUT
QUESTION WHETHER THIS LAD WAS HER SON OR NOT AND SO BANISH THESE
WEARING AND WORRYING DOUBTS
AH YES THIS WAS PLAINLY THE RIGHT WAY
OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY THEREFORE SHE SET HER WITS TO WORK AT ONCE TO
CONTRIVE THAT TEST
BUT IT WAS AN EASIER THING TO PROPOSE THAN TO
ACCOMPLISH
SHE TURNED OVER IN HER MIND ONE PROMISING TEST AFTER
ANOTHER BUT WAS OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH THEM ALL NONE OF THEM WERE
ABSOLUTELY SURE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AND AN IMPERFECT ONE COULD NOT
SATISFY HER
EVIDENTLY SHE WAS RACKING HER HEAD IN VAIN IT SEEMED
MANIFEST THAT SHE MUST GIVE THE MATTER UP
WHILE THIS DEPRESSING
THOUGHT WAS PASSING THROUGH HER MIND HER EAR CAUGHT THE REGULAR
BREATHING OF THE BOY AND SHE KNEW HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
AND WHILE SHE
LISTENED THE MEASURED BREATHING WAS BROKEN BY A SOFT STARTLED
CRY SUCH AS ONE UTTERS IN A TROUBLED DREAM
THIS CHANCE OCCURRENCE
FURNISHED HER INSTANTLY WITH A PLAN WORTH ALL HER LABOURED TESTS
COMBINED
SHE AT ONCE SET HERSELF FEVERISHLY BUT NOISELESSLY TO WORK
TO RELIGHT HER CANDLE MUTTERING TO HERSELF HAD I BUT SEEN HIM THEN
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN SINCE THAT DAY WHEN HE WAS LITTLE THAT THE
POWDER BURST IN HIS FACE HE HATH NEVER BEEN STARTLED OF A SUDDEN OUT OF
HIS DREAMS OR OUT OF HIS THINKINGS BUT HE HATH CAST HIS HAND BEFORE HIS
EYES EVEN AS HE DID THAT DAY AND NOT AS OTHERS WOULD DO IT WITH THE
PALM INWARD BUT ALWAYS WITH THE PALM TURNED OUTWARD I HAVE SEEN IT A
HUNDRED TIMES AND IT HATH NEVER VARIED NOR EVER FAILED
YES I SHALL
SOON KNOW NOW
BY THIS TIME SHE HAD CREPT TO THE SLUMBERING BOY'S SIDE WITH THE
CANDLE SHADED IN HER HAND
SHE BENT HEEDFULLY AND WARILY OVER HIM
SCARCELY BREATHING IN HER SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AND SUDDENLY FLASHED
THE LIGHT IN HIS FACE AND STRUCK THE FLOOR BY HIS EAR WITH HER KNUCKLES
THE SLEEPER'S EYES SPRANG WIDE OPEN AND HE CAST A STARTLED STARE ABOUT
HIM BUT HE MADE NO SPECIAL MOVEMENT WITH HIS HANDS
THE POOR WOMAN WAS SMITTEN ALMOST HELPLESS WITH SURPRISE AND GRIEF
BUT SHE CONTRIVED TO HIDE HER EMOTIONS AND TO SOOTHE THE BOY TO SLEEP
AGAIN THEN SHE CREPT APART AND COMMUNED MISERABLY WITH HERSELF UPON
THE DISASTROUS RESULT OF HER EXPERIMENT
SHE TRIED TO BELIEVE THAT HER
TOM'S MADNESS HAD BANISHED THIS HABITUAL GESTURE OF HIS BUT SHE COULD
NOT DO IT
NO SHE SAID HIS HANDS ARE NOT MAD THEY COULD NOT
UNLEARN SO OLD A HABIT IN SO BRIEF A TIME
OH THIS IS A HEAVY DAY FOR
ME
STILL HOPE WAS AS STUBBORN NOW AS DOUBT HAD BEEN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT
BRING HERSELF TO ACCEPT THE VERDICT OF THE TEST SHE MUST TRY THE THING
AGAIN THE FAILURE MUST HAVE BEEN ONLY AN ACCIDENT SO SHE STARTLED THE
BOY OUT OF HIS SLEEP A SECOND AND A THIRD TIME AT INTERVALS WITH THE
SAME RESULT WHICH HAD MARKED THE FIRST TEST THEN SHE DRAGGED HERSELF TO
BED AND FELL SORROWFULLY ASLEEP SAYING BUT I CANNOT GIVE HIM UP OH
NO I CANNOT I CANNOT HE MUST BE MY BOY
THE POOR MOTHER'S INTERRUPTIONS HAVING CEASED AND THE PRINCE'S PAINS
HAVING GRADUALLY LOST THEIR POWER TO DISTURB HIM UTTER WEARINESS AT
LAST SEALED HIS EYES IN A PROFOUND AND RESTFUL SLEEP
HOUR AFTER HOUR
SLIPPED AWAY AND STILL HE SLEPT LIKE THE DEAD
THUS FOUR OR FIVE HOURS
PASSED
THEN HIS STUPOR BEGAN TO LIGHTEN
PRESENTLY WHILE HALF ASLEEP
AND HALF AWAKE HE MURMURED
SIR WILLIAM
AFTER A MOMENT
HO SIR WILLIAM HERBERT HIE THEE HITHER AND LIST TO THE STRANGEST
DREAM THAT EVER
SIR WILLIAM DOST HEAR MAN I DID THINK ME
CHANGED TO A PAUPER AND
HO THERE GUARDS SIR WILLIAM WHAT
IS THERE NO GROOM OF THE CHAMBER IN WAITING ALACK IT SHALL GO HARD
WITH
WHAT AILETH THEE ASKED A WHISPER NEAR HIM
WHO ART THOU CALLING
SIR WILLIAM HERBERT
WHO ART THOU
I WHO SHOULD I BE BUT THY SISTER NAN OH TOM I HAD FORGOT
THOU'RT MAD YET POOR LAD THOU'RT MAD YET WOULD I HAD NEVER WOKE TO
KNOW IT AGAIN BUT PRITHEE MASTER THY TONGUE LEST WE BE ALL BEATEN
TILL WE DIE
THE STARTLED PRINCE SPRANG PARTLY UP BUT A SHARP REMINDER FROM HIS
STIFFENED BRUISES BROUGHT HIM TO HIMSELF AND HE SANK BACK AMONG HIS
FOUL STRAW WITH A MOAN AND THE EJACULATION
ALAS IT WAS NO DREAM THEN
IN A MOMENT ALL THE HEAVY SORROW AND MISERY WHICH SLEEP HAD BANISHED
WERE UPON HIM AGAIN AND HE REALISED THAT HE WAS NO LONGER A PETTED
PRINCE IN A PALACE WITH THE ADORING EYES OF A NATION UPON HIM BUT
A PAUPER AN OUTCAST CLOTHED IN RAGS PRISONER IN A DEN FIT ONLY FOR
BEASTS AND CONSORTING WITH BEGGARS AND THIEVES
IN THE MIDST OF HIS GRIEF HE BEGAN TO BE CONSCIOUS OF HILARIOUS NOISES
AND SHOUTINGS APPARENTLY BUT A BLOCK OR TWO AWAY
THE NEXT MOMENT
THERE WERE SEVERAL SHARP RAPS AT THE DOOR JOHN CANTY CEASED FROM
SNORING AND SAID
WHO KNOCKETH WHAT WILT THOU
A VOICE ANSWERED
KNOW'ST THOU WHO IT WAS THOU LAID THY CUDGEL ON
NO
NEITHER KNOW I NOR CARE
BELIKE THOU'LT CHANGE THY NOTE EFTSOONS
AN THOU WOULD SAVE THY NECK
NOTHING BUT FLIGHT MAY STEAD THEE
THE MAN IS THIS MOMENT DELIVERING UP
THE GHOST
'TIS THE PRIEST FATHER ANDREW
GOD A MERCY EXCLAIMED CANTY
HE ROUSED HIS FAMILY AND HOARSELY
COMMANDED UP WITH YE ALL AND FLY OR BIDE WHERE YE ARE AND PERISH
SCARCELY FIVE MINUTES LATER THE CANTY HOUSEHOLD WERE IN THE STREET AND
FLYING FOR THEIR LIVES
JOHN CANTY HELD THE PRINCE BY THE WRIST AND
HURRIED HIM ALONG THE DARK WAY GIVING HIM THIS CAUTION IN A LOW VOICE
MIND THY TONGUE THOU MAD FOOL AND SPEAK NOT OUR NAME
I WILL CHOOSE
ME A NEW NAME SPEEDILY TO THROW THE LAW'S DOGS OFF THE SCENT
MIND
THY TONGUE I TELL THEE
HE GROWLED THESE WORDS TO THE REST OF THE FAMILY
IF IT SO CHANCE THAT WE BE SEPARATED LET EACH MAKE FOR LONDON BRIDGE
WHOSO FINDETH HIMSELF AS FAR AS THE LAST LINEN DRAPER'S SHOP ON THE
BRIDGE LET HIM TARRY THERE TILL THE OTHERS BE COME THEN WILL WE FLEE
INTO SOUTHWARK TOGETHER
AT THIS MOMENT THE PARTY BURST SUDDENLY OUT OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT
AND NOT ONLY INTO LIGHT BUT INTO THE MIDST OF A MULTITUDE OF SINGING
DANCING AND SHOUTING PEOPLE MASSED TOGETHER ON THE RIVER FRONTAGE
THERE WAS A LINE OF BONFIRES STRETCHING AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE UP
AND DOWN THE THAMES LONDON BRIDGE WAS ILLUMINATED SOUTHWARK BRIDGE
LIKEWISE THE ENTIRE RIVER WAS AGLOW WITH THE FLASH AND SHEEN OF
COLOURED LIGHTS AND CONSTANT EXPLOSIONS OF FIREWORKS FILLED THE SKIES
WITH AN INTRICATE COMMINGLING OF SHOOTING SPLENDOURS AND A THICK RAIN
OF DAZZLING SPARKS THAT ALMOST TURNED NIGHT INTO DAY EVERYWHERE WERE
CROWDS OF REVELLERS ALL LONDON SEEMED TO BE AT LARGE
JOHN CANTY DELIVERED HIMSELF OF A FURIOUS CURSE AND COMMANDED A RETREAT
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
HE AND HIS TRIBE WERE SWALLOWED UP IN THAT
SWARMING HIVE OF HUMANITY AND HOPELESSLY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER IN
AN INSTANT
WE ARE NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE PRINCE WAS ONE OF HIS TRIBE
CANTY STILL KEPT HIS GRIP UPON HIM
THE PRINCE'S HEART WAS BEATING HIGH
WITH HOPES OF ESCAPE NOW
A BURLY WATERMAN CONSIDERABLY EXALTED WITH
LIQUOR FOUND HIMSELF RUDELY SHOVED BY CANTY IN HIS EFFORTS TO PLOUGH
THROUGH THE CROWD HE LAID HIS GREAT HAND ON CANTY'S SHOULDER AND SAID
NAY WHITHER SO FAST FRIEND DOST CANKER THY SOUL WITH SORDID
BUSINESS WHEN ALL THAT BE LEAL MEN AND TRUE MAKE HOLIDAY
MINE AFFAIRS ARE MINE OWN THEY CONCERN THEE NOT ANSWERED CANTY
ROUGHLY TAKE AWAY THY HAND AND LET ME PASS
SITH THAT IS THY HUMOUR THOU'LT NOT PASS TILL THOU'ST DRUNK TO THE
PRINCE OF WALES I TELL THEE THAT SAID THE WATERMAN BARRING THE WAY
RESOLUTELY
GIVE ME THE CUP THEN AND MAKE SPEED MAKE SPEED
OTHER REVELLERS WERE INTERESTED BY THIS TIME
THEY CRIED OUT
THE LOVING CUP THE LOVING CUP MAKE THE SOUR KNAVE DRINK THE
LOVING CUP ELSE WILL WE FEED HIM TO THE FISHES
SO A HUGE LOVING CUP WAS BROUGHT THE WATERMAN GRASPING IT BY ONE OF
ITS HANDLES AND WITH THE OTHER HAND BEARING UP THE END OF AN IMAGINARY
NAPKIN PRESENTED IT IN DUE AND ANCIENT FORM TO CANTY WHO HAD TO GRASP
THE OPPOSITE HANDLE WITH ONE OF HIS HANDS AND TAKE OFF THE LID WITH THE
OTHER ACCORDING TO ANCIENT CUSTOM
THIS LEFT THE PRINCE HAND FREE FOR
A SECOND OF COURSE
HE WASTED NO TIME BUT DIVED AMONG THE FOREST OF
LEGS ABOUT HIM AND DISAPPEARED
IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE COULD NOT HAVE
BEEN HARDER TO FIND UNDER THAT TOSSING SEA OF LIFE IF ITS BILLOWS HAD
BEEN THE ATLANTIC'S AND HE A LOST SIXPENCE
HE VERY SOON REALISED THIS FACT AND STRAIGHTWAY BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT
HIS OWN AFFAIRS WITHOUT FURTHER THOUGHT OF JOHN CANTY
HE QUICKLY
REALISED ANOTHER THING TOO
TO WIT THAT A SPURIOUS PRINCE OF WALES
WAS BEING FEASTED BY THE CITY IN HIS STEAD
HE EASILY CONCLUDED THAT
THE PAUPER LAD TOM CANTY HAD DELIBERATELY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIS
STUPENDOUS OPPORTUNITY AND BECOME A USURPER
THEREFORE THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE TO PURSUE FIND HIS WAY TO THE
GUILDHALL MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN AND DENOUNCE THE IMPOSTOR
HE ALSO MADE
UP HIS MIND THAT TOM SHOULD BE ALLOWED A REASONABLE TIME FOR SPIRITUAL
PREPARATION AND THEN BE HANGED DRAWN AND QUARTERED ACCORDING TO THE
LAW AND USAGE OF THE DAY IN CASES OF HIGH TREASON
CHAPTER XI
AT GUILDHALL
THE ROYAL BARGE ATTENDED BY ITS GORGEOUS FLEET TOOK ITS STATELY WAY
DOWN THE THAMES THROUGH THE WILDERNESS OF ILLUMINATED BOATS
THE AIR WAS
LADEN WITH MUSIC THE RIVER BANKS WERE BERUFFLED WITH JOY FLAMES THE
DISTANT CITY LAY IN A SOFT LUMINOUS GLOW FROM ITS COUNTLESS INVISIBLE
BONFIRES ABOVE IT ROSE MANY A SLENDER SPIRE INTO THE SKY INCRUSTED
WITH SPARKLING LIGHTS WHEREFORE IN THEIR REMOTENESS THEY SEEMED LIKE
JEWELLED LANCES THRUST ALOFT AS THE FLEET SWEPT ALONG IT WAS GREETED
FROM THE BANKS WITH A CONTINUOUS HOARSE ROAR OF CHEERS AND THE CEASELESS
FLASH AND BOOM OF ARTILLERY
TO TOM CANTY HALF BURIED IN HIS SILKEN CUSHIONS THESE SOUNDS AND THIS
SPECTACLE WERE A WONDER UNSPEAKABLY SUBLIME AND ASTONISHING
TO HIS
LITTLE FRIENDS AT HIS SIDE THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH AND THE LADY JANE
GREY THEY WERE NOTHING
ARRIVED AT THE DOWGATE THE FLEET WAS TOWED UP THE LIMPID WALBROOK
WHOSE CHANNEL HAS NOW BEEN FOR TWO CENTURIES BURIED OUT OF SIGHT UNDER
ACRES OF BUILDINGS TO BUCKLERSBURY PAST HOUSES AND UNDER BRIDGES
POPULOUS WITH MERRY MAKERS AND BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND AT LAST CAME TO
A HALT IN A BASIN WHERE NOW IS BARGE YARD IN THE CENTRE OF THE ANCIENT
CITY OF LONDON
TOM DISEMBARKED AND HE AND HIS GALLANT PROCESSION
CROSSED CHEAPSIDE AND MADE A SHORT MARCH THROUGH THE OLD JEWRY AND
BASINGHALL STREET TO THE GUILDHALL
TOM AND HIS LITTLE LADIES WERE RECEIVED WITH DUE CEREMONY BY THE LORD
MAYOR AND THE FATHERS OF THE CITY IN THEIR GOLD CHAINS AND SCARLET
ROBES OF STATE AND CONDUCTED TO A RICH CANOPY OF STATE AT THE HEAD OF
THE GREAT HALL PRECEDED BY HERALDS MAKING PROCLAMATION AND BY THE MACE
AND THE CITY SWORD
THE LORDS AND LADIES WHO WERE TO ATTEND UPON TOM
AND HIS TWO SMALL FRIENDS TOOK THEIR PLACES BEHIND THEIR CHAIRS
AT A LOWER TABLE THE COURT GRANDEES AND OTHER GUESTS OF NOBLE DEGREE
WERE SEATED WITH THE MAGNATES OF THE CITY THE COMMONERS TOOK PLACES AT
A MULTITUDE OF TABLES ON THE MAIN FLOOR OF THE HALL
FROM THEIR LOFTY
VANTAGE GROUND THE GIANTS GOG AND MAGOG THE ANCIENT GUARDIANS OF THE
CITY CONTEMPLATED THE SPECTACLE BELOW THEM WITH EYES GROWN FAMILIAR
TO IT IN FORGOTTEN GENERATIONS
THERE WAS A BUGLE BLAST AND A
PROCLAMATION AND A FAT BUTLER APPEARED IN A HIGH PERCH IN THE LEFTWARD
WALL FOLLOWED BY HIS SERVITORS BEARING WITH IMPRESSIVE SOLEMNITY A
ROYAL BARON OF BEEF SMOKING HOT AND READY FOR THE KNIFE
AFTER GRACE TOM BEING INSTRUCTED ROSE AND THE WHOLE HOUSE WITH
HIM AND DRANK FROM A PORTLY GOLDEN LOVING CUP WITH THE PRINCESS
ELIZABETH FROM HER IT PASSED TO THE LADY JANE AND THEN TRAVERSED THE
GENERAL ASSEMBLAGE
SO THE BANQUET BEGAN
BY MIDNIGHT THE REVELRY WAS AT ITS HEIGHT
NOW CAME ONE OF THOSE
PICTURESQUE SPECTACLES SO ADMIRED IN THAT OLD DAY
A DESCRIPTION OF IT
IS STILL EXTANT IN THE QUAINT WORDING OF A CHRONICLER WHO WITNESSED IT
'SPACE BEING MADE PRESENTLY ENTERED A BARON AND AN EARL APPARELED AFTER
THE TURKISH FASHION IN LONG ROBES OF BAWDKIN POWDERED WITH GOLD HATS ON
THEIR HEADS OF CRIMSON VELVET WITH GREAT ROLLS OF GOLD GIRDED WITH TWO
SWORDS CALLED SCIMITARS HANGING BY GREAT BAWDRICKS OF GOLD
NEXT CAME
YET ANOTHER BARON AND ANOTHER EARL IN TWO LONG GOWNS OF YELLOW SATIN
TRAVERSED WITH WHITE SATIN AND IN EVERY BEND OF WHITE WAS A BEND OF
CRIMSON SATIN AFTER THE FASHION OF RUSSIA WITH FURRED HATS OF GRAY ON
THEIR HEADS EITHER OF THEM HAVING AN HATCHET IN THEIR HANDS AND BOOTS
WITH PYKES' POINTS A FOOT LONG 'TURNED UP
AND AFTER THEM CAME
A KNIGHT THEN THE LORD HIGH ADMIRAL AND WITH HIM FIVE NOBLES IN
DOUBLETS OF CRIMSON VELVET VOYDED LOW ON THE BACK AND BEFORE TO THE
CANNELL BONE LACED ON THE BREASTS WITH CHAINS OF SILVER AND OVER
THAT SHORT CLOAKS OF CRIMSON SATIN AND ON THEIR HEADS HATS AFTER
THE DANCERS' FASHION WITH PHEASANTS' FEATHERS IN THEM
THESE WERE
APPARELED AFTER THE FASHION OF PRUSSIA
THE TORCHBEARERS WHICH WERE
ABOUT AN HUNDRED WERE APPARELED IN CRIMSON SATIN AND GREEN LIKE MOORS
THEIR FACES BLACK
NEXT CAME IN A MOMMARYE
THEN THE MINSTRELS WHICH
WERE DISGUISED DANCED AND THE LORDS AND LADIES DID WILDLY DANCE ALSO
THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO BEHOLD
AND WHILE TOM IN HIS HIGH SEAT WAS GAZING UPON THIS 'WILD' DANCING
LOST IN ADMIRATION OF THE DAZZLING COMMINGLING OF KALEIDOSCOPIC COLOURS
WHICH THE WHIRLING TURMOIL OF GAUDY FIGURES BELOW HIM PRESENTED THE
RAGGED BUT REAL LITTLE PRINCE OF WALES WAS PROCLAIMING HIS RIGHTS AND
HIS WRONGS DENOUNCING THE IMPOSTOR AND CLAMOURING FOR ADMISSION AT
THE GATES OF GUILDHALL THE CROWD ENJOYED THIS EPISODE PRODIGIOUSLY
AND PRESSED FORWARD AND CRANED THEIR NECKS TO SEE THE SMALL RIOTER
PRESENTLY THEY BEGAN TO TAUNT HIM AND MOCK AT HIM PURPOSELY TO GOAD HIM
INTO A HIGHER AND STILL MORE ENTERTAINING FURY
TEARS OF MORTIFICATION
SPRANG TO HIS EYES BUT HE STOOD HIS GROUND AND DEFIED THE MOB RIGHT
ROYALLY
OTHER TAUNTS FOLLOWED ADDED MOCKINGS STUNG HIM AND HE
EXCLAIMED
I TELL YE AGAIN YOU PACK OF UNMANNERLY CURS I AM THE PRINCE OF WALES
AND ALL FORLORN AND FRIENDLESS AS I BE WITH NONE TO GIVE ME WORD OF
GRACE OR HELP ME IN MY NEED YET WILL NOT I BE DRIVEN FROM MY GROUND
BUT WILL MAINTAIN IT
THOUGH THOU BE PRINCE OR NO PRINCE 'TIS ALL ONE THOU BE'ST A GALLANT
LAD AND NOT FRIENDLESS NEITHER HERE STAND I BY THY SIDE TO PROVE
IT AND MIND I TELL THEE THOU MIGHT'ST HAVE A WORSER FRIEND THAN MILES
HENDON AND YET NOT TIRE THY LEGS WITH SEEKING
REST THY SMALL JAW MY
CHILD I TALK THE LANGUAGE OF THESE BASE KENNEL RATS LIKE TO A VERY
NATIVE
THE SPEAKER WAS A SORT OF DON CAESAR DE BAZAN IN DRESS ASPECT AND
BEARING
HE WAS TALL TRIM BUILT MUSCULAR
HIS DOUBLET AND TRUNKS
WERE OF RICH MATERIAL BUT FADED AND THREADBARE AND THEIR GOLD LACE
ADORNMENTS WERE SADLY TARNISHED HIS RUFF WAS RUMPLED AND DAMAGED
THE PLUME IN HIS SLOUCHED HAT WAS BROKEN AND HAD A BEDRAGGLED AND
DISREPUTABLE LOOK AT HIS SIDE HE WORE A LONG RAPIER IN A RUSTY IRON
SHEATH HIS SWAGGERING CARRIAGE MARKED HIM AT ONCE AS A RUFFLER OF
THE CAMP
THE SPEECH OF THIS FANTASTIC FIGURE WAS RECEIVED WITH AN
EXPLOSION OF JEERS AND LAUGHTER
SOME CRIED 'TIS ANOTHER PRINCE IN
DISGUISE 'WARE THY TONGUE FRIEND BELIKE HE IS DANGEROUS
MARRY HE LOOKETH IT MARK HIS EYE PLUCK THE LAD FROM HIM TO THE
HORSE POND WI' THE CUB
INSTANTLY A HAND WAS LAID UPON THE PRINCE UNDER THE IMPULSE OF THIS
HAPPY THOUGHT AS INSTANTLY THE STRANGER'S LONG SWORD WAS OUT AND THE
MEDDLER WENT TO THE EARTH UNDER A SOUNDING THUMP WITH THE FLAT OF IT
THE NEXT MOMENT A SCORE OF VOICES SHOUTED KILL THE DOG KILL HIM
KILL HIM AND THE MOB CLOSED IN ON THE WARRIOR WHO BACKED HIMSELF
AGAINST A WALL AND BEGAN TO LAY ABOUT HIM WITH HIS LONG WEAPON LIKE A
MADMAN
HIS VICTIMS SPRAWLED THIS WAY AND THAT BUT THE MOB TIDE POURED
OVER THEIR PROSTRATE FORMS AND DASHED ITSELF AGAINST THE CHAMPION WITH
UNDIMINISHED FURY
HIS MOMENTS SEEMED NUMBERED HIS DESTRUCTION CERTAIN WHEN SUDDENLY A
TRUMPET BLAST SOUNDED A VOICE SHOUTED WAY FOR THE KING'S MESSENGER
AND A TROOP OF HORSEMEN CAME CHARGING DOWN UPON THE MOB WHO FLED OUT OF
HARM'S REACH AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM
THE BOLD STRANGER
CAUGHT UP THE PRINCE IN HIS ARMS AND WAS SOON FAR AWAY FROM DANGER AND
THE MULTITUDE
RETURN WE WITHIN THE GUILDHALL
SUDDENLY HIGH ABOVE THE JUBILANT ROAR
AND THUNDER OF THE REVEL BROKE THE CLEAR PEAL OF A BUGLE NOTE
THERE
WAS INSTANT SILENCE A DEEP HUSH THEN A SINGLE VOICE ROSE THAT OF THE
MESSENGER FROM THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO PIPE FORTH A PROCLAMATION THE
WHOLE MULTITUDE STANDING LISTENING
THE CLOSING WORDS SOLEMNLY PRONOUNCED WERE
THE KING IS DEAD
THE GREAT ASSEMBLAGE BENT THEIR HEADS UPON THEIR BREASTS WITH ONE
ACCORD REMAINED SO IN PROFOUND SILENCE A FEW MOMENTS THEN ALL SANK
UPON THEIR KNEES IN A BODY STRETCHED OUT THEIR HANDS TOWARD TOM AND A
MIGHTY SHOUT BURST FORTH THAT SEEMED TO SHAKE THE BUILDING
LONG LIVE THE KING
POOR TOM'S DAZED EYES WANDERED ABROAD OVER THIS STUPEFYING SPECTACLE
AND FINALLY RESTED DREAMILY UPON THE KNEELING PRINCESSES BESIDE HIM A
MOMENT THEN UPON THE EARL OF HERTFORD
A SUDDEN PURPOSE DAWNED IN HIS
FACE
HE SAID IN A LOW TONE AT LORD HERTFORD'S EAR
ANSWER ME TRULY ON THY FAITH AND HONOUR UTTERED I HERE A COMMAND
THE WHICH NONE BUT A KING MIGHT HOLD PRIVILEGE AND PREROGATIVE TO UTTER
WOULD SUCH COMMANDMENT BE OBEYED AND NONE RISE UP TO SAY ME NAY
NONE MY LIEGE IN ALL THESE REALMS
IN THY PERSON BIDES THE MAJESTY
OF ENGLAND
THOU ART THE KING THY WORD IS LAW
TOM RESPONDED IN A STRONG EARNEST VOICE AND WITH GREAT ANIMATION
THEN SHALL THE KING'S LAW BE LAW OF MERCY FROM THIS DAY AND NEVER
MORE BE LAW OF BLOOD UP FROM THY KNEES AND AWAY TO THE TOWER AND
SAY THE KING DECREES THE DUKE OF NORFOLK SHALL NOT DIE
THE WORDS WERE CAUGHT UP AND CARRIED EAGERLY FROM LIP TO LIP FAR AND
WIDE OVER THE HALL AND AS HERTFORD HURRIED FROM THE PRESENCE ANOTHER
PRODIGIOUS SHOUT BURST FORTH
THE REIGN OF BLOOD IS ENDED LONG LIVE EDWARD KING OF ENGLAND
CHAPTER XII
THE PRINCE AND HIS DELIVERER
AS SOON AS MILES HENDON AND THE LITTLE PRINCE WERE CLEAR OF THE MOB
THEY STRUCK DOWN THROUGH BACK LANES AND ALLEYS TOWARD THE RIVER
THEIR
WAY WAS UNOBSTRUCTED UNTIL THEY APPROACHED LONDON BRIDGE THEN THEY
PLOUGHED INTO THE MULTITUDE AGAIN HENDON KEEPING A FAST GRIP UPON
THE PRINCE'S NO THE KING'S WRIST
THE TREMENDOUS NEWS WAS ALREADY
ABROAD AND THE BOY LEARNED IT FROM A THOUSAND VOICES AT ONCE THE KING
IS DEAD THE TIDINGS STRUCK A CHILL TO THE HEART OF THE POOR LITTLE
WAIF AND SENT A SHUDDER THROUGH HIS FRAME
HE REALISED THE GREATNESS
OF HIS LOSS AND WAS FILLED WITH A BITTER GRIEF FOR THE GRIM TYRANT WHO
HAD BEEN SUCH A TERROR TO OTHERS HAD ALWAYS BEEN GENTLE WITH HIM
THE
TEARS SPRANG TO HIS EYES AND BLURRED ALL OBJECTS
FOR AN INSTANT
HE FELT HIMSELF THE MOST FORLORN OUTCAST AND FORSAKEN OF GOD'S
CREATURES THEN ANOTHER CRY SHOOK THE NIGHT WITH ITS FAR REACHING
THUNDERS LONG LIVE KING EDWARD THE SIXTH AND THIS MADE HIS EYES
KINDLE AND THRILLED HIM WITH PRIDE TO HIS FINGERS' ENDS
AH HE
THOUGHT HOW GRAND AND STRANGE IT SEEMS I AM KING
OUR FRIENDS THREADED THEIR WAY SLOWLY THROUGH THE THRONGS UPON THE
BRIDGE
THIS STRUCTURE WHICH HAD STOOD FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS AND
HAD BEEN A NOISY AND POPULOUS THOROUGHFARE ALL THAT TIME WAS A CURIOUS
AFFAIR FOR A CLOSELY PACKED RANK OF STORES AND SHOPS WITH FAMILY
QUARTERS OVERHEAD STRETCHED ALONG BOTH SIDES OF IT FROM ONE BANK OF
THE RIVER TO THE OTHER
THE BRIDGE WAS A SORT OF TOWN TO ITSELF IT
HAD ITS INN ITS BEER HOUSES ITS BAKERIES ITS HABERDASHERIES ITS FOOD
MARKETS ITS MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND EVEN ITS CHURCH
IT
LOOKED UPON THE TWO NEIGHBOURS WHICH IT LINKED TOGETHER LONDON
AND SOUTHWARK AS BEING WELL ENOUGH AS SUBURBS BUT NOT OTHERWISE
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
IT WAS A CLOSE CORPORATION SO TO SPEAK IT WAS
A NARROW TOWN OF A SINGLE STREET A FIFTH OF A MILE LONG ITS
POPULATION WAS BUT A VILLAGE POPULATION AND EVERYBODY IN IT KNEW ALL
HIS FELLOW TOWNSMEN INTIMATELY AND HAD KNOWN THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS
BEFORE THEM AND ALL THEIR LITTLE FAMILY AFFAIRS INTO THE BARGAIN
IT
HAD ITS ARISTOCRACY OF COURSE ITS FINE OLD FAMILIES OF BUTCHERS AND
BAKERS AND WHAT NOT WHO HAD OCCUPIED THE SAME OLD PREMISES FOR FIVE
OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS AND KNEW THE GREAT HISTORY OF THE BRIDGE FROM
BEGINNING TO END AND ALL ITS STRANGE LEGENDS AND WHO ALWAYS TALKED
BRIDGY TALK AND THOUGHT BRIDGY THOUGHTS AND LIED IN A LONG LEVEL
DIRECT SUBSTANTIAL BRIDGY WAY
IT WAS JUST THE SORT OF POPULATION TO
BE NARROW AND IGNORANT AND SELF CONCEITED
CHILDREN WERE BORN ON THE
BRIDGE WERE REARED THERE GREW TO OLD AGE AND FINALLY DIED WITHOUT
EVER HAVING SET A FOOT UPON ANY PART OF THE WORLD BUT LONDON BRIDGE
ALONE
SUCH PEOPLE WOULD NATURALLY IMAGINE THAT THE MIGHTY AND
INTERMINABLE PROCESSION WHICH MOVED THROUGH ITS STREET NIGHT AND DAY
WITH ITS CONFUSED ROAR OF SHOUTS AND CRIES ITS NEIGHINGS AND BELLOWING
AND BLEATINGS AND ITS MUFFLED THUNDER TRAMP WAS THE ONE GREAT THING IN
THIS WORLD AND THEMSELVES SOMEHOW THE PROPRIETORS OF IT
AND SO THEY
WERE IN EFFECT AT LEAST THEY COULD EXHIBIT IT FROM THEIR WINDOWS AND
DID FOR A CONSIDERATION WHENEVER A RETURNING KING OR HERO GAVE IT A
FLEETING SPLENDOUR FOR THERE WAS NO PLACE LIKE IT FOR AFFORDING A LONG
STRAIGHT UNINTERRUPTED VIEW OF MARCHING COLUMNS
MEN BORN AND REARED UPON THE BRIDGE FOUND LIFE UNENDURABLY DULL AND
INANE ELSEWHERE
HISTORY TELLS OF ONE OF THESE WHO LEFT THE BRIDGE AT
THE AGE OF SEVENTY ONE AND RETIRED TO THE COUNTRY
BUT HE COULD ONLY
FRET AND TOSS IN HIS BED HE COULD NOT GO TO SLEEP THE DEEP STILLNESS
WAS SO PAINFUL SO AWFUL SO OPPRESSIVE
WHEN HE WAS WORN OUT WITH IT
AT LAST HE FLED BACK TO HIS OLD HOME A LEAN AND HAGGARD SPECTRE AND
FELL PEACEFULLY TO REST AND PLEASANT DREAMS UNDER THE LULLING MUSIC OF
THE LASHING WATERS AND THE BOOM AND CRASH AND THUNDER OF LONDON BRIDGE
IN THE TIMES OF WHICH WE ARE WRITING THE BRIDGE FURNISHED 'OBJECT
LESSONS' IN ENGLISH HISTORY FOR ITS CHILDREN NAMELY THE LIVID AND
DECAYING HEADS OF RENOWNED MEN IMPALED UPON IRON SPIKES ATOP OF ITS
GATEWAYS
BUT WE DIGRESS
HENDON'S LODGINGS WERE IN THE LITTLE INN ON THE BRIDGE
AS HE NEARED
THE DOOR WITH HIS SMALL FRIEND A ROUGH VOICE SAID
SO THOU'RT COME AT LAST THOU'LT NOT ESCAPE AGAIN I WARRANT THEE
AND IF POUNDING THY BONES TO A PUDDING CAN TEACH THEE SOMEWHAT THOU'LT
NOT KEEP US WAITING ANOTHER TIME MAYHAP AND JOHN CANTY PUT OUT HIS
HAND TO SEIZE THE BOY
MILES HENDON STEPPED IN THE WAY AND SAID
NOT TOO FAST FRIEND
THOU ART NEEDLESSLY ROUGH METHINKS
WHAT IS
THE LAD TO THEE
IF IT BE ANY BUSINESS OF THINE TO MAKE AND MEDDLE IN OTHERS' AFFAIRS
HE IS MY SON
'TIS A LIE CRIED THE LITTLE KING HOTLY
BOLDLY SAID AND I BELIEVE THEE WHETHER THY SMALL HEADPIECE BE SOUND
OR CRACKED MY BOY

SO GO THY WAYS AND SET QUICK ABOUT IT
FOR I LIKE NOT MUCH BANDYING OF WORDS BEING NOT OVER PATIENT IN MY
NATURE
JOHN CANTY MOVED OFF MUTTERING THREATS AND CURSES AND WAS SWALLOWED
FROM SIGHT IN THE CROWD
HENDON ASCENDED THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS TO HIS
ROOM WITH HIS CHARGE AFTER ORDERING A MEAL TO BE SENT THITHER
IT
WAS A POOR APARTMENT WITH A SHABBY BED AND SOME ODDS AND ENDS OF OLD
FURNITURE IN IT AND WAS VAGUELY LIGHTED BY A COUPLE OF SICKLY CANDLES
THE LITTLE KING DRAGGED HIMSELF TO THE BED AND LAY DOWN UPON IT ALMOST
EXHAUSTED WITH HUNGER AND FATIGUE
HE HAD BEEN ON HIS FEET A GOOD
PART OF A DAY AND A NIGHT FOR IT WAS NOW TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING AND HAD EATEN NOTHING MEANTIME
HE MURMURED DROWSILY
PRITHEE CALL ME WHEN THE TABLE IS SPREAD AND SANK INTO A DEEP SLEEP
IMMEDIATELY
A SMILE TWINKLED IN HENDON'S EYE AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF
BY THE MASS THE LITTLE BEGGAR TAKES TO ONE'S QUARTERS AND USURPS ONE'S
BED WITH AS NATURAL AND EASY A GRACE AS IF HE OWNED THEM WITH NEVER
A BY YOUR LEAVE OR SO PLEASE IT YOU OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT
IN HIS
DISEASED RAVINGS HE CALLED HIMSELF THE PRINCE OF WALES AND BRAVELY DOTH
HE KEEP UP THE CHARACTER
POOR LITTLE FRIENDLESS RAT DOUBTLESS HIS
MIND HAS BEEN DISORDERED WITH ILL USAGE
WELL I WILL BE HIS FRIEND
I HAVE SAVED HIM AND IT DRAWETH ME STRONGLY TO HIM ALREADY I LOVE THE
BOLD TONGUED LITTLE RASCAL
HOW SOLDIER LIKE HE FACED THE SMUTTY RABBLE
AND FLUNG BACK HIS HIGH DEFIANCE AND WHAT A COMELY SWEET AND GENTLE
FACE HE HATH NOW THAT SLEEP HATH CONJURED AWAY ITS TROUBLES AND ITS
GRIEFS

ELDER BROTHER AND CARE FOR HIM AND WATCH OVER HIM AND WHOSO WOULD
SHAME HIM OR DO HIM HURT MAY ORDER HIS SHROUD FOR THOUGH I BE BURNT FOR
IT HE SHALL NEED IT
HE BENT OVER THE BOY AND CONTEMPLATED HIM WITH KIND AND PITYING
INTEREST TAPPING THE YOUNG CHEEK TENDERLY AND SMOOTHING BACK THE
TANGLED CURLS WITH HIS GREAT BROWN HAND
A SLIGHT SHIVER PASSED OVER
THE BOY'S FORM
HENDON MUTTERED
SEE NOW HOW LIKE A MAN IT WAS TO LET HIM LIE HERE UNCOVERED AND FILL
HIS BODY WITH DEADLY RHEUMS
NOW WHAT SHALL I DO 'TWILL WAKE HIM TO
TAKE HIM UP AND PUT HIM WITHIN THE BED AND HE SORELY NEEDETH SLEEP
HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR EXTRA COVERING BUT FINDING NONE DOFFED HIS DOUBLET
AND WRAPPED THE LAD IN IT SAYING I AM USED TO NIPPING AIR AND SCANT
APPAREL 'TIS LITTLE I SHALL MIND THE COLD THEN WALKED UP AND DOWN
THE ROOM TO KEEP HIS BLOOD IN MOTION SOLILOQUISING AS BEFORE
HIS INJURED MIND PERSUADES HIM HE IS PRINCE OF WALES 'TWILL BE ODD TO
HAVE A PRINCE OF WALES STILL WITH US NOW THAT HE THAT WAS THE PRINCE
IS PRINCE NO MORE BUT KING FOR THIS POOR MIND IS SET UPON THE ONE
FANTASY AND WILL NOT REASON OUT THAT NOW IT SHOULD CAST BY THE PRINCE
AND CALL ITSELF THE KING
IF MY FATHER LIVETH STILL AFTER THESE
SEVEN YEARS THAT I HAVE HEARD NOUGHT FROM HOME IN MY FOREIGN DUNGEON HE
WILL WELCOME THE POOR LAD AND GIVE HIM GENEROUS SHELTER FOR MY SAKE SO
WILL MY GOOD ELDER BROTHER ARTHUR MY OTHER BROTHER HUGH BUT I WILL
CRACK HIS CROWN AN HE INTERFERE THE FOX HEARTED ILL CONDITIONED
ANIMAL YES THITHER WILL WE FARE AND STRAIGHTWAY TOO
A SERVANT ENTERED WITH A SMOKING MEAL DISPOSED IT UPON A SMALL DEAL
TABLE PLACED THE CHAIRS AND TOOK HIS DEPARTURE LEAVING SUCH CHEAP
LODGERS AS THESE TO WAIT UPON THEMSELVES
THE DOOR SLAMMED AFTER HIM
AND THE NOISE WOKE THE BOY WHO SPRANG TO A SITTING POSTURE AND SHOT
A GLAD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THEN A GRIEVED LOOK CAME INTO HIS FACE AND HE
MURMURED TO HIMSELF WITH A DEEP SIGH ALACK IT WAS BUT A DREAM WOE
IS ME NEXT HE NOTICED MILES HENDON'S DOUBLET GLANCED FROM THAT TO
HENDON COMPREHENDED THE SACRIFICE THAT HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIM AND SAID
GENTLY
THOU ART GOOD TO ME YES THOU ART VERY GOOD TO ME
TAKE IT AND PUT IT
ON I SHALL NOT NEED IT MORE
THEN HE GOT UP AND WALKED TO THE WASHSTAND IN THE CORNER AND STOOD
THERE WAITING
HENDON SAID IN A CHEERY VOICE
WE'LL HAVE A RIGHT HEARTY SUP AND BITE NOW FOR EVERYTHING IS SAVOURY
AND SMOKING HOT AND THAT AND THY NAP TOGETHER WILL MAKE THEE A LITTLE
MAN AGAIN NEVER FEAR
THE BOY MADE NO ANSWER BUT BENT A STEADY LOOK THAT WAS FILLED WITH
GRAVE SURPRISE AND ALSO SOMEWHAT TOUCHED WITH IMPATIENCE UPON THE TALL
KNIGHT OF THE SWORD
HENDON WAS PUZZLED AND SAID
WHAT'S AMISS
GOOD SIR I WOULD WASH ME
OH IS THAT ALL ASK NO PERMISSION OF MILES HENDON FOR AUGHT THOU
CRAVEST
MAKE THYSELF PERFECTLY FREE HERE AND WELCOME WITH ALL THAT
ARE HIS BELONGINGS
STILL THE BOY STOOD AND MOVED NOT MORE HE TAPPED THE FLOOR ONCE OR
TWICE WITH HIS SMALL IMPATIENT FOOT
HENDON WAS WHOLLY PERPLEXED
SAID
HE
BLESS US WHAT IS IT
PRITHEE POUR THE WATER AND MAKE NOT SO MANY WORDS
HENDON SUPPRESSING A HORSE LAUGH AND SAYING TO HIMSELF BY ALL THE
SAINTS BUT THIS IS ADMIRABLE STEPPED BRISKLY FORWARD AND DID THE
SMALL INSOLENT'S BIDDING THEN STOOD BY IN A SORT OF STUPEFACTION
UNTIL THE COMMAND COME THE TOWEL WOKE HIM SHARPLY UP
HE TOOK UP A
TOWEL FROM UNDER THE BOY'S NOSE AND HANDED IT TO HIM WITHOUT COMMENT
HE NOW PROCEEDED TO COMFORT HIS OWN FACE WITH A WASH AND WHILE HE WAS
AT IT HIS ADOPTED CHILD SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE AND PREPARED TO FALL
TO
HENDON DESPATCHED HIS ABLUTIONS WITH ALACRITY THEN DREW BACK THE
OTHER CHAIR AND WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF AT TABLE WHEN THE BOY SAID
INDIGNANTLY
FORBEAR WOULDST SIT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
THIS BLOW STAGGERED HENDON TO HIS FOUNDATIONS
HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
LO THE POOR THING'S MADNESS IS UP WITH THE TIME IT HATH CHANGED
WITH THE GREAT CHANGE THAT IS COME TO THE REALM AND NOW IN FANCY IS
HE KING GOOD LACK I MUST HUMOUR THE CONCEIT TOO THERE IS NO OTHER
WAY FAITH HE WOULD ORDER ME TO THE TOWER ELSE
AND PLEASED WITH THIS JEST HE REMOVED THE CHAIR FROM THE TABLE
TOOK HIS STAND BEHIND THE KING AND PROCEEDED TO WAIT UPON HIM IN THE
COURTLIEST WAY HE WAS CAPABLE OF
WHILE THE KING ATE THE RIGOUR OF HIS ROYAL DIGNITY RELAXED A LITTLE
AND WITH HIS GROWING CONTENTMENT CAME A DESIRE TO TALK
HE SAID I
THINK THOU CALLEST THYSELF MILES HENDON IF I HEARD THEE ARIGHT
YES SIRE MILES REPLIED THEN OBSERVED TO HIMSELF IF I MUST
HUMOUR THE POOR LAD'S MADNESS I MUST 'SIRE' HIM I MUST 'MAJESTY' HIM
I MUST NOT GO BY HALVES I MUST STICK AT NOTHING THAT BELONGETH TO THE
PART I PLAY ELSE SHALL I PLAY IT ILL AND WORK EVIL TO THIS CHARITABLE
AND KINDLY CAUSE
THE KING WARMED HIS HEART WITH A SECOND GLASS OF WINE AND SAID I
WOULD KNOW THEE TELL ME THY STORY
THOU HAST A GALLANT WAY WITH THEE
AND A NOBLE ART NOBLY BORN
WE ARE OF THE TAIL OF THE NOBILITY GOOD YOUR MAJESTY
MY FATHER IS
A BARONET ONE OF THE SMALLER LORDS BY KNIGHT SERVICE 2 SIR RICHARD
HENDON OF HENDON HALL BY MONK'S HOLM IN KENT
THE NAME HAS ESCAPED MY MEMORY
GO ON TELL ME THY STORY
'TIS NOT MUCH YOUR MAJESTY YET PERCHANCE IT MAY BEGUILE A SHORT
HALF HOUR FOR WANT OF A BETTER
MY FATHER SIR RICHARD IS VERY RICH
AND OF A MOST GENEROUS NATURE
MY MOTHER DIED WHILST I WAS YET A
BOY
I HAVE TWO BROTHERS ARTHUR MY ELDER WITH A SOUL LIKE TO
HIS FATHER'S AND HUGH YOUNGER THAN I A MEAN SPIRIT COVETOUS
TREACHEROUS VICIOUS UNDERHANDED A REPTILE
SUCH WAS HE FROM THE
CRADLE SUCH WAS HE TEN YEARS PAST WHEN I LAST SAW HIM A RIPE RASCAL
AT NINETEEN I BEING TWENTY THEN AND ARTHUR TWENTY TWO
THERE IS
NONE OTHER OF US BUT THE LADY EDITH MY COUSIN SHE WAS SIXTEEN
THEN BEAUTIFUL GENTLE GOOD THE DAUGHTER OF AN EARL THE LAST OF HER
RACE HEIRESS OF A GREAT FORTUNE AND A LAPSED TITLE
MY FATHER WAS HER
GUARDIAN
I LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED ME BUT SHE WAS BETROTHED TO ARTHUR
FROM THE CRADLE AND SIR RICHARD WOULD NOT SUFFER THE CONTRACT TO BE
BROKEN
ARTHUR LOVED ANOTHER MAID AND BADE US BE OF GOOD CHEER AND
HOLD FAST TO THE HOPE THAT DELAY AND LUCK TOGETHER WOULD SOME DAY GIVE
SUCCESS TO OUR SEVERAL CAUSES
HUGH LOVED THE LADY EDITH'S FORTUNE
THOUGH IN TRUTH HE SAID IT WAS HERSELF HE LOVED BUT THEN 'TWAS HIS WAY
ALWAY TO SAY THE ONE THING AND MEAN THE OTHER
BUT HE LOST HIS ARTS
UPON THE GIRL HE COULD DECEIVE MY FATHER BUT NONE ELSE
MY FATHER
LOVED HIM BEST OF US ALL AND TRUSTED AND BELIEVED HIM FOR HE WAS THE
YOUNGEST CHILD AND OTHERS HATED HIM THESE QUALITIES BEING IN ALL
AGES SUFFICIENT TO WIN A PARENT'S DEAREST LOVE AND HE HAD A SMOOTH
PERSUASIVE TONGUE WITH AN ADMIRABLE GIFT OF LYING AND THESE BE
QUALITIES WHICH DO MIGHTILY ASSIST A BLIND AFFECTION TO COZEN ITSELF
I WAS WILD IN TROTH I MIGHT GO YET FARTHER AND SAY VERY WILD THOUGH
'TWAS A WILDNESS OF AN INNOCENT SORT SINCE IT HURT NONE BUT ME BROUGHT
SHAME TO NONE NOR LOSS NOR HAD IN IT ANY TAINT OF CRIME OR BASENESS
OR WHAT MIGHT NOT BESEEM MINE HONOURABLE DEGREE
YET DID MY BROTHER HUGH TURN THESE FAULTS TO GOOD ACCOUNT HE SEEING
THAT OUR BROTHER ARTHUR'S HEALTH WAS BUT INDIFFERENT AND HOPING THE
WORST MIGHT WORK HIM PROFIT WERE I SWEPT OUT OF THE PATH SO BUT 'TWERE
A LONG TALE GOOD MY LIEGE AND LITTLE WORTH THE TELLING
BRIEFLY
THEN THIS BROTHER DID DEFTLY MAGNIFY MY FAULTS AND MAKE THEM
CRIMES ENDING HIS BASE WORK WITH FINDING A SILKEN LADDER IN MINE
APARTMENTS CONVEYED THITHER BY HIS OWN MEANS AND DID CONVINCE MY
FATHER BY THIS AND SUBORNED EVIDENCE OF SERVANTS AND OTHER LYING
KNAVES THAT I WAS MINDED TO CARRY OFF MY EDITH AND MARRY WITH HER IN
RANK DEFIANCE OF HIS WILL
THREE YEARS OF BANISHMENT FROM HOME AND ENGLAND MIGHT MAKE A SOLDIER
AND A MAN OF ME MY FATHER SAID AND TEACH ME SOME DEGREE OF WISDOM
I FOUGHT OUT MY LONG PROBATION IN THE CONTINENTAL WARS TASTING
SUMPTUOUSLY OF HARD KNOCKS PRIVATION AND ADVENTURE BUT IN MY LAST
BATTLE I WAS TAKEN CAPTIVE AND DURING THE SEVEN YEARS THAT HAVE WAXED
AND WANED SINCE THEN A FOREIGN DUNGEON HATH HARBOURED ME
THROUGH WIT
AND COURAGE I WON TO THE FREE AIR AT LAST AND FLED HITHER STRAIGHT AND
AM BUT JUST ARRIVED RIGHT POOR IN PURSE AND RAIMENT AND POORER STILL
IN KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THESE DULL SEVEN YEARS HAVE WROUGHT AT HENDON HALL
ITS PEOPLE AND BELONGINGS
SO PLEASE YOU SIR MY MEAGRE TALE IS TOLD
THOU HAST BEEN SHAMEFULLY ABUSED SAID THE LITTLE KING WITH A
FLASHING EYE
BUT I WILL RIGHT THEE BY THE CROSS WILL I THE KING
HATH SAID IT
THEN FIRED BY THE STORY OF MILES'S WRONGS HE LOOSED HIS TONGUE AND
POURED THE HISTORY OF HIS OWN RECENT MISFORTUNES INTO THE EARS OF HIS
ASTONISHED LISTENER
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED MILES SAID TO HIMSELF
LO WHAT AN IMAGINATION HE HATH VERILY THIS IS NO COMMON MIND ELSE
CRAZED OR SANE IT COULD NOT WEAVE SO STRAIGHT AND GAUDY A TALE AS THIS
OUT OF THE AIRY NOTHINGS WHEREWITH IT HATH WROUGHT THIS CURIOUS ROMAUNT
POOR RUINED LITTLE HEAD IT SHALL NOT LACK FRIEND OR SHELTER WHILST I
BIDE WITH THE LIVING
HE SHALL NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE HE SHALL BE MY
PET MY LITTLE COMRADE
AND HE SHALL BE CURED AY MADE WHOLE AND
SOUND THEN WILL HE MAKE HIMSELF A NAME AND PROUD SHALL I BE TO SAY
'YES HE IS MINE I TOOK HIM A HOMELESS LITTLE RAGAMUFFIN BUT I SAW
WHAT WAS IN HIM AND I SAID HIS NAME WOULD BE HEARD SOME DAY BEHOLD
HIM OBSERVE HIM WAS I RIGHT
THE KING SPOKE IN A THOUGHTFUL MEASURED VOICE
THOU DIDST SAVE ME INJURY AND SHAME PERCHANCE MY LIFE AND SO MY
CROWN
SUCH SERVICE DEMANDETH RICH REWARD
NAME THY DESIRE AND SO IT
BE WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY ROYAL POWER IT IS THINE
THIS FANTASTIC SUGGESTION STARTLED HENDON OUT OF HIS REVERIE
HE WAS
ABOUT TO THANK THE KING AND PUT THE MATTER ASIDE WITH SAYING HE HAD ONLY
DONE HIS DUTY AND DESIRED NO REWARD BUT A WISER THOUGHT CAME INTO HIS
HEAD AND HE ASKED LEAVE TO BE SILENT A FEW MOMENTS AND CONSIDER THE
GRACIOUS OFFER AN IDEA WHICH THE KING GRAVELY APPROVED REMARKING THAT
IT WAS BEST TO BE NOT TOO HASTY WITH A THING OF SUCH GREAT IMPORT
MILES REFLECTED DURING SOME MOMENTS THEN SAID TO HIMSELF YES THAT IS
THE THING TO DO BY ANY OTHER MEANS IT WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AT IT AND
CERTES THIS HOUR'S EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME 'TWOULD BE MOST WEARING AND
INCONVENIENT TO CONTINUE IT AS IT IS
YES I WILL PROPOSE IT 'TWAS A
HAPPY ACCIDENT THAT I DID NOT THROW THE CHANCE AWAY THEN HE DROPPED
UPON ONE KNEE AND SAID
MY POOR SERVICE WENT NOT BEYOND THE LIMIT OF A SUBJECT'S SIMPLE DUTY
AND THEREFORE HATH NO MERIT BUT SINCE YOUR MAJESTY IS PLEASED TO HOLD
IT WORTHY SOME REWARD I TAKE HEART OF GRACE TO MAKE PETITION TO THIS
EFFECT
NEAR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO AS YOUR GRACE KNOWETH THERE BEING
ILL BLOOD BETWIXT JOHN KING OF ENGLAND AND THE KING OF FRANCE IT WAS
DECREED THAT TWO CHAMPIONS SHOULD FIGHT TOGETHER IN THE LISTS AND SO
SETTLE THE DISPUTE BY WHAT IS CALLED THE ARBITRAMENT OF GOD
THESE TWO
KINGS AND THE SPANISH KING BEING ASSEMBLED TO WITNESS AND JUDGE THE
CONFLICT THE FRENCH CHAMPION APPEARED BUT SO REDOUBTABLE WAS HE THAT
OUR ENGLISH KNIGHTS REFUSED TO MEASURE WEAPONS WITH HIM
SO THE MATTER
WHICH WAS A WEIGHTY ONE WAS LIKE TO GO AGAINST THE ENGLISH MONARCH BY
DEFAULT
NOW IN THE TOWER LAY THE LORD DE COURCY THE MIGHTIEST ARM IN
ENGLAND STRIPPED OF HIS HONOURS AND POSSESSIONS AND WASTING WITH
LONG CAPTIVITY
APPEAL WAS MADE TO HIM HE GAVE ASSENT AND CAME FORTH
ARRAYED FOR BATTLE BUT NO SOONER DID THE FRENCHMAN GLIMPSE HIS HUGE
FRAME AND HEAR HIS FAMOUS NAME BUT HE FLED AWAY AND THE FRENCH KING'S
CAUSE WAS LOST
KING JOHN RESTORED DE COURCY'S TITLES AND POSSESSIONS
AND SAID 'NAME THY WISH AND THOU SHALT HAVE IT THOUGH IT COST ME HALF
MY KINGDOM WHEREAT DE COURCY KNEELING AS I DO NOW MADE ANSWER
'THIS THEN I ASK MY LIEGE THAT I AND MY SUCCESSORS MAY HAVE AND
HOLD THE PRIVILEGE OF REMAINING COVERED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KINGS OF
ENGLAND HENCEFORTH WHILE THE THRONE SHALL LAST THE BOON WAS GRANTED
AS YOUR MAJESTY KNOWETH AND THERE HATH BEEN NO TIME THESE FOUR HUNDRED
YEARS THAT THAT LINE HAS FAILED OF AN HEIR AND SO EVEN UNTO THIS DAY
THE HEAD OF THAT ANCIENT HOUSE STILL WEARETH HIS HAT OR HELM BEFORE THE
KING'S MAJESTY WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE AND THIS NONE OTHER MAY DO
3 INVOKING THIS PRECEDENT IN AID OF MY PRAYER I BESEECH THE KING TO
GRANT TO ME BUT THIS ONE GRACE AND PRIVILEGE TO MY MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
REWARD AND NONE OTHER TO WIT THAT I AND MY HEIRS FOR EVER MAY
SIT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MAJESTY OF ENGLAND
RISE SIR MILES HENDON KNIGHT SAID THE KING GRAVELY GIVING THE
ACCOLADE WITH HENDON'S SWORD RISE AND SEAT THYSELF
THY PETITION IS
GRANTED
WHILST ENGLAND REMAINS AND THE CROWN CONTINUES THE PRIVILEGE
SHALL NOT LAPSE
HIS MAJESTY WALKED APART MUSING AND HENDON DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AT
TABLE OBSERVING TO HIMSELF 'TWAS A BRAVE THOUGHT AND HATH WROUGHT
ME A MIGHTY DELIVERANCE MY LEGS ARE GRIEVOUSLY WEARIED
AN I HAD NOT
THOUGHT OF THAT I MUST HAVE HAD TO STAND FOR WEEKS TILL MY POOR LAD'S
WITS ARE CURED AFTER A LITTLE HE WENT ON AND SO I AM BECOME A
KNIGHT OF THE KINGDOM OF DREAMS AND SHADOWS A MOST ODD AND STRANGE
POSITION TRULY FOR ONE SO MATTER OF FACT AS I
I WILL NOT LAUGH NO
GOD FORBID FOR THIS THING WHICH IS SO SUBSTANCELESS TO ME IS REAL TO
HIM
AND TO ME ALSO IN ONE WAY IT IS NOT A FALSITY FOR IT REFLECTS
WITH TRUTH THE SWEET AND GENEROUS SPIRIT THAT IS IN HIM AFTER
A PAUSE AH WHAT IF HE SHOULD CALL ME BY MY FINE TITLE BEFORE
FOLK THERE'D BE A MERRY CONTRAST BETWIXT MY GLORY AND MY RAIMENT BUT
NO MATTER LET HIM CALL ME WHAT HE WILL SO IT PLEASE HIM I SHALL BE
CONTENT
CHAPTER XIII
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE PRINCE
A HEAVY DROWSINESS PRESENTLY FELL UPON THE TWO COMRADES
THE KING
SAID
REMOVE THESE RAGS MEANING HIS CLOTHING
HENDON DISAPPARELLED THE BOY WITHOUT DISSENT OR REMARK TUCKED HIM UP IN
BED THEN GLANCED ABOUT THE ROOM SAYING TO HIMSELF RUEFULLY HE HATH
TAKEN MY BED AGAIN AS BEFORE MARRY WHAT SHALL I DO THE LITTLE
KING OBSERVED HIS PERPLEXITY AND DISSIPATED IT WITH A WORD
HE SAID
SLEEPILY
THOU WILT SLEEP ATHWART THE DOOR AND GUARD IT IN A MOMENT MORE HE
WAS OUT OF HIS TROUBLES IN A DEEP SLUMBER
DEAR HEART HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BORN A KING MUTTERED HENDON
ADMIRINGLY HE PLAYETH THE PART TO A MARVEL
THEN HE STRETCHED HIMSELF ACROSS THE DOOR ON THE FLOOR SAYING
CONTENTEDLY
I HAVE LODGED WORSE FOR SEVEN YEARS 'TWOULD BE BUT ILL GRATITUDE TO
HIM ABOVE TO FIND FAULT WITH THIS
HE DROPPED ASLEEP AS THE DAWN APPEARED
TOWARD NOON HE ROSE UNCOVERED
HIS UNCONSCIOUS WARD A SECTION AT A TIME AND TOOK HIS MEASURE WITH A
STRING
THE KING AWOKE JUST AS HE HAD COMPLETED HIS WORK COMPLAINED
OF THE COLD AND ASKED WHAT HE WAS DOING
'TIS DONE NOW MY LIEGE SAID HENDON I HAVE A BIT OF BUSINESS
OUTSIDE BUT WILL PRESENTLY RETURN SLEEP THOU AGAIN THOU NEEDEST IT
THERE LET ME COVER THY HEAD ALSO THOU'LT BE WARM THE SOONER
THE KING WAS BACK IN DREAMLAND BEFORE THIS SPEECH WAS ENDED
MILES
SLIPPED SOFTLY OUT AND SLIPPED AS SOFTLY IN AGAIN IN THE COURSE OF
THIRTY OR FORTY MINUTES WITH A COMPLETE SECOND HAND SUIT OF BOY'S
CLOTHING OF CHEAP MATERIAL AND SHOWING SIGNS OF WEAR BUT TIDY AND
SUITED TO THE SEASON OF THE YEAR
HE SEATED HIMSELF AND BEGAN TO
OVERHAUL HIS PURCHASE MUMBLING TO HIMSELF
A LONGER PURSE WOULD HAVE GOT A BETTER SORT BUT WHEN ONE HAS NOT THE
LONG PURSE ONE MUST BE CONTENT WITH WHAT A SHORT ONE MAY DO
'THERE WAS A WOMAN IN OUR TOWN IN OUR TOWN DID DWELL
HE STIRRED METHINKS I MUST SING IN A LESS THUNDEROUS KEY 'TIS NOT
GOOD TO MAR HIS SLEEP WITH THIS JOURNEY BEFORE HIM AND HE SO WEARIED
OUT POOR CHAP

DO TO THE END OF TIME HELD THE NEEDLE STILL AND TRIED TO THRUST THE
THREAD THROUGH THE EYE WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF A WOMAN'S WAY
TIME
AND TIME AGAIN THE THREAD MISSED THE MARK GOING SOMETIMES ON ONE SIDE
OF THE NEEDLE SOMETIMES ON THE OTHER SOMETIMES DOUBLING UP AGAINST THE
SHAFT BUT HE WAS PATIENT HAVING BEEN THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES BEFORE
WHEN HE WAS SOLDIERING
HE SUCCEEDED AT LAST AND TOOK UP THE GARMENT
THAT HAD LAIN WAITING MEANTIME ACROSS HIS LAP AND BEGAN HIS WORK

CONSEQUENTLY TOM GREW VERY WEARY OF THE CEREMONY SO WEARY THAT HE FELT
AN ALMOST GUSHING GRATEFULNESS WHEN HE AT LAST SAW HIS LONG SILKEN HOSE
BEGIN THE JOURNEY DOWN THE LINE AND KNEW THAT THE END OF THE MATTER
WAS DRAWING NEAR
BUT HE EXULTED TOO SOON
THE FIRST LORD OF THE
BEDCHAMBER RECEIVED THE HOSE AND WAS ABOUT TO ENCASE TOM'S LEGS IN THEM
WHEN A SUDDEN FLUSH INVADED HIS FACE AND HE HURRIEDLY HUSTLED THE THINGS
BACK INTO THE HANDS OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY WITH AN ASTOUNDED
LOOK AND A WHISPERED SEE MY LORD POINTING TO A SOMETHING CONNECTED
WITH THE HOSE
THE ARCHBISHOP PALED THEN FLUSHED AND PASSED THE
HOSE TO THE LORD HIGH ADMIRAL WHISPERING SEE MY LORD THE ADMIRAL
PASSED THE HOSE TO THE HEREDITARY GRAND DIAPERER AND HAD HARDLY BREATH
ENOUGH IN HIS BODY TO EJACULATE SEE MY LORD THE HOSE DRIFTED
BACKWARD ALONG THE LINE TO THE CHIEF STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE
CONSTABLE OF THE TOWER NORROY KING AT ARMS THE MASTER OF THE WARDROBE
THE CHANCELLOR ROYAL OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER THE THIRD GROOM OF THE
STOLE THE HEAD RANGER OF WINDSOR FOREST THE SECOND GENTLEMAN OF THE
BEDCHAMBER THE FIRST LORD OF THE BUCKHOUNDS ACCOMPANIED ALWAYS WITH
THAT AMAZED AND FRIGHTENED SEE SEE TILL THEY FINALLY REACHED THE
HANDS OF THE CHIEF EQUERRY IN WAITING WHO GAZED A MOMENT WITH A PALLID
FACE UPON WHAT HAD CAUSED ALL THIS DISMAY THEN HOARSELY WHISPERED
BODY OF MY LIFE A TAG GONE FROM A TRUSS POINT TO THE TOWER WITH
THE HEAD KEEPER OF THE KING'S HOSE AFTER WHICH HE LEANED UPON THE
SHOULDER OF THE FIRST LORD OF THE BUCKHOUNDS TO REGATHER HIS VANISHED
STRENGTH WHILST FRESH HOSE WITHOUT ANY DAMAGED STRINGS TO THEM WERE
BROUGHT
BUT ALL THINGS MUST HAVE AN END AND SO IN TIME TOM CANTY WAS IN A
CONDITION TO GET OUT OF BED
THE PROPER OFFICIAL POURED WATER THE
PROPER OFFICIAL ENGINEERED THE WASHING THE PROPER OFFICIAL STOOD BY
WITH A TOWEL AND BY AND BY TOM GOT SAFELY THROUGH THE PURIFYING STAGE
AND WAS READY FOR THE SERVICES OF THE HAIRDRESSER ROYAL
WHEN HE AT
LENGTH EMERGED FROM THIS MASTER'S HANDS HE WAS A GRACIOUS FIGURE AND
AS PRETTY AS A GIRL IN HIS MANTLE AND TRUNKS OF PURPLE SATIN AND
PURPLE PLUMED CAP
HE NOW MOVED IN STATE TOWARD HIS BREAKFAST ROOM
THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE COURTLY ASSEMBLAGE AND AS HE PASSED THESE
FELL BACK LEAVING HIS WAY FREE AND DROPPED UPON THEIR KNEES
AFTER BREAKFAST HE WAS CONDUCTED WITH REGAL CEREMONY ATTENDED BY HIS
GREAT OFFICERS AND HIS GUARD OF FIFTY GENTLEMEN PENSIONERS BEARING GILT
BATTLE AXES TO THE THRONE ROOM WHERE HE PROCEEDED TO TRANSACT BUSINESS
OF STATE
HIS 'UNCLE LORD HERTFORD TOOK HIS STAND BY THE THRONE TO
ASSIST THE ROYAL MIND WITH WISE COUNSEL
THE BODY OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN NAMED BY THE LATE KING AS HIS EXECUTORS
APPEARED TO ASK TOM'S APPROVAL OF CERTAIN ACTS OF THEIRS RATHER A
FORM AND YET NOT WHOLLY A FORM SINCE THERE WAS NO PROTECTOR AS YET
THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY MADE REPORT OF THE DECREE OF THE COUNCIL
OF EXECUTORS CONCERNING THE OBSEQUIES OF HIS LATE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
MAJESTY AND FINISHED BY READING THE SIGNATURES OF THE EXECUTORS TO
WIT THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY THE LORD CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND
WILLIAM LORD ST
JOHN JOHN LORD RUSSELL EDWARD EARL OF HERTFORD JOHN
VISCOUNT LISLE CUTHBERT BISHOP OF DURHAM
TOM WAS NOT LISTENING AN EARLIER CLAUSE OF THE DOCUMENT WAS PUZZLING
HIM
AT THIS POINT HE TURNED AND WHISPERED TO LORD HERTFORD
WHAT DAY DID HE SAY THE BURIAL HATH BEEN APPOINTED FOR
THE SIXTEENTH OF THE COMING MONTH MY LIEGE
'TIS A STRANGE FOLLY
WILL HE KEEP
POOR CHAP HE WAS STILL NEW TO THE CUSTOMS OF ROYALTY HE WAS USED TO
SEEING THE FORLORN DEAD OF OFFAL COURT HUSTLED OUT OF THE WAY WITH A
VERY DIFFERENT SORT OF EXPEDITION
HOWEVER THE LORD HERTFORD SET HIS
MIND AT REST WITH A WORD OR TWO
A SECRETARY OF STATE PRESENTED AN ORDER OF THE COUNCIL APPOINTING THE
MORROW AT ELEVEN FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE FOREIGN AMBASSADORS AND
DESIRED THE KING'S ASSENT
TOM TURNED AN INQUIRING LOOK TOWARD HERTFORD WHO WHISPERED
YOUR MAJESTY WILL SIGNIFY CONSENT
THEY COME TO TESTIFY THEIR ROYAL
MASTERS' SENSE OF THE HEAVY CALAMITY WHICH HATH VISITED YOUR GRACE AND
THE REALM OF ENGLAND
TOM DID AS HE WAS BIDDEN
ANOTHER SECRETARY BEGAN TO READ A PREAMBLE
CONCERNING THE EXPENSES OF THE LATE KING'S HOUSEHOLD WHICH HAD AMOUNTED
TO 28 000 POUNDS DURING THE PRECEDING SIX MONTHS A SUM SO VAST THAT IT
MADE TOM CANTY GASP HE GASPED AGAIN WHEN THE FACT APPEARED THAT 20 000
POUNDS OF THIS MONEY WAS STILL OWING AND UNPAID 4 AND ONCE MORE WHEN
IT APPEARED THAT THE KING'S COFFERS WERE ABOUT EMPTY AND HIS TWELVE
HUNDRED SERVANTS MUCH EMBARRASSED FOR LACK OF THE WAGES DUE THEM
TOM
SPOKE OUT WITH LIVELY APPREHENSION
WE BE GOING TO THE DOGS 'TIS PLAIN
'TIS MEET AND NECESSARY THAT WE
TAKE A SMALLER HOUSE AND SET THE SERVANTS AT LARGE SITH THEY BE OF NO
VALUE BUT TO MAKE DELAY AND TROUBLE ONE WITH OFFICES THAT HARASS THE
SPIRIT AND SHAME THE SOUL THEY MISBECOMING ANY BUT A DOLL THAT HATH
NOR BRAINS NOR HANDS TO HELP ITSELF WITHAL
I REMEMBER ME OF A SMALL
HOUSE THAT STANDETH OVER AGAINST THE FISH MARKET BY BILLINGSGATE
A SHARP PRESSURE UPON TOM'S ARM STOPPED HIS FOOLISH TONGUE AND SENT A
BLUSH TO HIS FACE BUT NO COUNTENANCE THERE BETRAYED ANY SIGN THAT THIS
STRANGE SPEECH HAD BEEN REMARKED OR GIVEN CONCERN
A SECRETARY MADE REPORT THAT FORASMUCH AS THE LATE KING HAD PROVIDED IN
HIS WILL FOR CONFERRING THE DUCAL DEGREE UPON THE EARL OF HERTFORD AND
RAISING HIS BROTHER SIR THOMAS SEYMOUR TO THE PEERAGE AND LIKEWISE
HERTFORD'S SON TO AN EARLDOM TOGETHER WITH SIMILAR AGGRANDISEMENTS TO
OTHER GREAT SERVANTS OF THE CROWN THE COUNCIL HAD RESOLVED TO HOLD A
SITTING ON THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY FOR THE DELIVERING AND CONFIRMING OF
THESE HONOURS AND THAT MEANTIME THE LATE KING NOT HAVING GRANTED
IN WRITING ESTATES SUITABLE TO THE SUPPORT OF THESE DIGNITIES THE
COUNCIL KNOWING HIS PRIVATE WISHES IN THAT REGARD HAD THOUGHT PROPER
TO GRANT TO SEYMOUR '500 POUND LANDS AND TO HERTFORD'S SON '800
POUND LANDS AND 300 POUND OF THE NEXT BISHOP'S LANDS WHICH SHOULD FALL
VACANT HIS PRESENT MAJESTY BEING WILLING
5
TOM WAS ABOUT TO BLURT OUT SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROPRIETY OF PAYING THE
LATE KING'S DEBTS FIRST BEFORE SQUANDERING ALL THIS MONEY BUT A
TIMELY TOUCH UPON HIS ARM FROM THE THOUGHTFUL HERTFORD SAVED HIM
THIS INDISCRETION WHEREFORE HE GAVE THE ROYAL ASSENT WITHOUT SPOKEN
COMMENT BUT WITH MUCH INWARD DISCOMFORT
WHILE HE SAT REFLECTING A
MOMENT OVER THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS DOING STRANGE AND GLITTERING
MIRACLES A HAPPY THOUGHT SHOT INTO HIS MIND WHY NOT MAKE HIS MOTHER
DUCHESS OF OFFAL COURT AND GIVE HER AN ESTATE BUT A SORROWFUL
THOUGHT SWEPT IT INSTANTLY AWAY HE WAS ONLY A KING IN NAME THESE GRAVE
VETERANS AND GREAT NOBLES WERE HIS MASTERS TO THEM HIS MOTHER WAS ONLY
THE CREATURE OF A DISEASED MIND THEY WOULD SIMPLY LISTEN TO HIS PROJECT
WITH UNBELIEVING EARS THEN SEND FOR THE DOCTOR
THE DULL WORK WENT TEDIOUSLY ON
PETITIONS WERE READ AND
PROCLAMATIONS PATENTS AND ALL MANNER OF WORDY REPETITIOUS AND
WEARISOME PAPERS RELATING TO THE PUBLIC BUSINESS AND AT LAST TOM SIGHED
PATHETICALLY AND MURMURED TO HIMSELF IN WHAT HAVE I OFFENDED THAT THE
GOOD GOD SHOULD TAKE ME AWAY FROM THE FIELDS AND THE FREE AIR AND THE
SUNSHINE TO SHUT ME UP HERE AND MAKE ME A KING AND AFFLICT ME SO
THEN HIS POOR MUDDLED HEAD NODDED A WHILE AND PRESENTLY DROOPED TO HIS
SHOULDER AND THE BUSINESS OF THE EMPIRE CAME TO A STANDSTILL FOR WANT
OF THAT AUGUST FACTOR THE RATIFYING POWER
SILENCE ENSUED AROUND
THE SLUMBERING CHILD AND THE SAGES OF THE REALM CEASED FROM THEIR
DELIBERATIONS
DURING THE FORENOON TOM HAD AN ENJOYABLE HOUR BY PERMISSION OF HIS
KEEPERS HERTFORD AND ST
JOHN WITH THE LADY ELIZABETH AND THE LITTLE
LADY JANE GREY THOUGH THE SPIRITS OF THE PRINCESSES WERE RATHER SUBDUED
BY THE MIGHTY STROKE THAT HAD FALLEN UPON THE ROYAL HOUSE AND AT THE
END OF THE VISIT HIS 'ELDER SISTER' AFTERWARDS THE 'BLOODY MARY' OF
HISTORY CHILLED HIM WITH A SOLEMN INTERVIEW WHICH HAD BUT ONE MERIT IN
HIS EYES ITS BREVITY
HE HAD A FEW MOMENTS TO HIMSELF AND THEN A SLIM
LAD OF ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WAS ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE WHOSE
CLOTHING EXCEPT HIS SNOWY RUFF AND THE LACES ABOUT HIS WRISTS WAS OF
BLACK DOUBLET HOSE AND ALL
HE BORE NO BADGE OF MOURNING BUT A KNOT
OF PURPLE RIBBON ON HIS SHOULDER
HE ADVANCED HESITATINGLY WITH HEAD
BOWED AND BARE AND DROPPED UPON ONE KNEE IN FRONT OF TOM
TOM SAT STILL
AND CONTEMPLATED HIM SOBERLY A MOMENT
THEN HE SAID
RISE LAD
WHO ART THOU
WHAT WOULDST HAVE
THE BOY ROSE AND STOOD AT GRACEFUL EASE BUT WITH AN ASPECT OF CONCERN
IN HIS FACE
HE SAID
OF A SURETY THOU MUST REMEMBER ME MY LORD
I AM THY WHIPPING BOY
MY WHIPPING BOY
THE SAME YOUR GRACE
I AM HUMPHREY HUMPHREY MARLOW
TOM PERCEIVED THAT HERE WAS SOMEONE WHOM HIS KEEPERS OUGHT TO HAVE
POSTED HIM ABOUT
THE SITUATION WAS DELICATE
WHAT SHOULD HE
DO PRETEND HE KNEW THIS LAD AND THEN BETRAY BY HIS EVERY UTTERANCE
THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE NO THAT WOULD NOT DO
AN IDEA
CAME TO HIS RELIEF ACCIDENTS LIKE THIS MIGHT BE LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH
SOME FREQUENCY NOW THAT BUSINESS URGENCIES WOULD OFTEN CALL HERTFORD
AND ST
JOHN FROM HIS SIDE THEY BEING MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF
EXECUTORS THEREFORE PERHAPS IT WOULD BE WELL TO STRIKE OUT A PLAN
HIMSELF TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH EMERGENCIES
YES THAT WOULD
BE A WISE COURSE HE WOULD PRACTISE ON THIS BOY AND SEE WHAT SORT OF
SUCCESS HE MIGHT ACHIEVE
SO HE STROKED HIS BROW PERPLEXEDLY A MOMENT
OR TWO AND PRESENTLY SAID
NOW I SEEM TO REMEMBER THEE SOMEWHAT BUT MY WIT IS CLOGGED AND DIM
WITH SUFFERING
ALACK MY POOR MASTER EJACULATED THE WHIPPING BOY WITH FEELING
ADDING TO HIMSELF IN TRUTH 'TIS AS THEY SAID HIS MIND IS GONE ALAS

NOT HIRED A BOY TO TAKE MY COMBINGS AND MY DRESSINGS FOR ME WOULD
HEAVEN THEY WOULD AN' THEY WILL DO THIS THING I WILL TAKE MY LASHINGS
IN MINE OWN PERSON GIVING GOD THANKS FOR THE CHANGE THEN HE SAID

PERADVENTURE IT MAY BE ANNULLED AS UNBEFITTING THE SEASON OF MOURNING

THEN WILL I SPEAK IT OUT FOR IT LIETH NEAR MY HEART
SITH THOU ART
NO MORE PRINCE OF WALES BUT KING THOU CANST ORDER MATTERS AS THOU WILT
WITH NONE TO SAY THEE NAY WHEREFORE IT IS NOT IN REASON THAT THOU WILT

AN'
THOU CEASE FROM STUDY MINE OFFICE IS GONE THOU'LT NEED NO WHIPPING BOY

TOM WAS TOUCHED WITH THIS PATHETIC DISTRESS
HE SAID WITH A RIGHT
ROYAL BURST OF GENEROSITY
DISCOMFORT THYSELF NO FURTHER LAD
THINE OFFICE SHALL BE PERMANENT IN
THEE AND THY LINE FOR EVER THEN HE STRUCK THE BOY A LIGHT BLOW ON THE
SHOULDER WITH THE FLAT OF HIS SWORD EXCLAIMING RISE HUMPHREY MARLOW
HEREDITARY GRAND WHIPPING BOY TO THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ENGLAND BANISH
SORROW I WILL BETAKE ME TO MY BOOKS AGAIN AND STUDY SO ILL THAT THEY
MUST IN JUSTICE TREBLE THY WAGE SO MIGHTILY SHALL THE BUSINESS OF THINE
OFFICE BE AUGMENTED
THE GRATEFUL HUMPHREY RESPONDED FERVIDLY
THANKS O MOST NOBLE MASTER THIS PRINCELY LAVISHNESS DOTH FAR SURPASS
MY MOST DISTEMPERED DREAMS OF FORTUNE
NOW SHALL I BE HAPPY ALL MY
DAYS AND ALL THE HOUSE OF MARLOW AFTER ME
TOM HAD WIT ENOUGH TO PERCEIVE THAT HERE WAS A LAD WHO COULD BE USEFUL
TO HIM
HE ENCOURAGED HUMPHREY TO TALK AND HE WAS NOTHING LOATH
HE WAS DELIGHTED TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS HELPING IN TOM'S 'CURE' FOR
ALWAYS AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED CALLING BACK TO TOM'S DISEASED MIND
THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF HIS EXPERIENCES AND ADVENTURES IN THE ROYAL
SCHOOL ROOM AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE PALACE HE NOTICED THAT TOM WAS THEN
ABLE TO 'RECALL' THE CIRCUMSTANCES QUITE CLEARLY
AT THE END OF AN
HOUR TOM FOUND HIMSELF WELL FREIGHTED WITH VERY VALUABLE INFORMATION
CONCERNING PERSONAGES AND MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE COURT SO HE
RESOLVED TO DRAW INSTRUCTION FROM THIS SOURCE DAILY AND TO THIS END HE
WOULD GIVE ORDER TO ADMIT HUMPHREY TO THE ROYAL CLOSET WHENEVER HE MIGHT
COME PROVIDED THE MAJESTY OF ENGLAND WAS NOT ENGAGED WITH OTHER PEOPLE
HUMPHREY HAD HARDLY BEEN DISMISSED WHEN MY LORD HERTFORD ARRIVED WITH
MORE TROUBLE FOR TOM
HE SAID THAT THE LORDS OF THE COUNCIL FEARING THAT SOME OVERWROUGHT
REPORT OF THE KING'S DAMAGED HEALTH MIGHT HAVE LEAKED OUT AND GOT
ABROAD THEY DEEMED IT WISE AND BEST THAT HIS MAJESTY SHOULD BEGIN TO
DINE IN PUBLIC AFTER A DAY OR TWO HIS WHOLESOME COMPLEXION AND VIGOROUS
STEP ASSISTED BY A CAREFULLY GUARDED REPOSE OF MANNER AND EASE AND
GRACE OF DEMEANOUR WOULD MORE SURELY QUIET THE GENERAL PULSE IN CASE
ANY EVIL RUMOURS HAD GONE ABOUT THAN ANY OTHER SCHEME THAT COULD BE
DEVISED
THEN THE EARL PROCEEDED VERY DELICATELY TO INSTRUCT TOM AS TO THE
OBSERVANCES PROPER TO THE STATELY OCCASION UNDER THE RATHER THIN
DISGUISE OF 'REMINDING' HIM CONCERNING THINGS ALREADY KNOWN TO HIM BUT
TO HIS VAST GRATIFICATION IT TURNED OUT THAT TOM NEEDED VERY LITTLE HELP
IN THIS LINE HE HAD BEEN MAKING USE OF HUMPHREY IN THAT DIRECTION FOR
HUMPHREY HAD MENTIONED THAT WITHIN A FEW DAYS HE WAS TO BEGIN TO DINE
IN PUBLIC HAVING GATHERED IT FROM THE SWIFT WINGED GOSSIP OF THE COURT
TOM KEPT THESE FACTS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER
SEEING THE ROYAL MEMORY SO IMPROVED THE EARL VENTURED TO APPLY A
FEW TESTS TO IT IN AN APPARENTLY CASUAL WAY TO FIND OUT HOW FAR ITS
AMENDMENT HAD PROGRESSED
THE RESULTS WERE HAPPY HERE AND THERE IN
SPOTS SPOTS WHERE HUMPHREY'S TRACKS REMAINED AND ON THE WHOLE MY LORD
WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND ENCOURAGED
SO ENCOURAGED WAS HE INDEED THAT
HE SPOKE UP AND SAID IN A QUITE HOPEFUL VOICE
NOW AM I PERSUADED THAT IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL BUT TAX YOUR MEMORY YET
A LITTLE FURTHER IT WILL RESOLVE THE PUZZLE OF THE GREAT SEAL A LOSS
WHICH WAS OF MOMENT YESTERDAY ALTHOUGH OF NONE TO DAY SINCE ITS TERM
OF SERVICE ENDED WITH OUR LATE LORD'S LIFE
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE TO
MAKE THE TRIAL
TOM WAS AT SEA A GREAT SEAL WAS SOMETHING WHICH HE WAS TOTALLY
UNACQUAINTED WITH
AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION HE LOOKED UP INNOCENTLY
AND ASKED
WHAT WAS IT LIKE MY LORD
THE EARL STARTED ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF ALACK
HIS WITS ARE FLOWN AGAIN IT WAS ILL WISDOM TO LEAD HIM ON TO STRAIN
THEM THEN HE DEFTLY TURNED THE TALK TO OTHER MATTERS WITH THE PURPOSE
OF SWEEPING THE UNLUCKY SEAL OUT OF TOM'S THOUGHTS A PURPOSE WHICH
EASILY SUCCEEDED
CHAPTER XV
TOM AS KING
THE NEXT DAY THE FOREIGN AMBASSADORS CAME WITH THEIR GORGEOUS TRAINS
AND TOM THRONED IN AWFUL STATE RECEIVED THEM
THE SPLENDOURS OF THE
SCENE DELIGHTED HIS EYE AND FIRED HIS IMAGINATION AT FIRST BUT
THE AUDIENCE WAS LONG AND DREARY AND SO WERE MOST OF THE
ADDRESSES WHEREFORE WHAT BEGAN AS A PLEASURE GREW INTO WEARINESS AND
HOME SICKNESS BY AND BY
TOM SAID THE WORDS WHICH HERTFORD PUT INTO
HIS MOUTH FROM TIME TO TIME AND TRIED HARD TO ACQUIT HIMSELF
SATISFACTORILY BUT HE WAS TOO NEW TO SUCH THINGS AND TOO ILL AT EASE
TO ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN A TOLERABLE SUCCESS
HE LOOKED SUFFICIENTLY
LIKE A KING BUT HE WAS ILL ABLE TO FEEL LIKE ONE
HE WAS CORDIALLY
GLAD WHEN THE CEREMONY WAS ENDED
THE LARGER PART OF HIS DAY WAS 'WASTED' AS HE TERMED IT IN HIS OWN
MIND IN LABOURS PERTAINING TO HIS ROYAL OFFICE
EVEN THE TWO HOURS
DEVOTED TO CERTAIN PRINCELY PASTIMES AND RECREATIONS WERE RATHER A
BURDEN TO HIM THAN OTHERWISE THEY WERE SO FETTERED BY RESTRICTIONS
AND CEREMONIOUS OBSERVANCES
HOWEVER HE HAD A PRIVATE HOUR WITH
HIS WHIPPING BOY WHICH HE COUNTED CLEAR GAIN SINCE HE GOT BOTH
ENTERTAINMENT AND NEEDFUL INFORMATION OUT OF IT
THE THIRD DAY OF TOM CANTY'S KINGSHIP CAME AND WENT MUCH AS THE OTHERS
HAD DONE BUT THERE WAS A LIFTING OF HIS CLOUD IN ONE WAY HE FELT
LESS UNCOMFORTABLE THAN AT FIRST HE WAS GETTING A LITTLE USED TO HIS
CIRCUMSTANCES AND SURROUNDINGS HIS CHAINS STILL GALLED BUT NOT ALL THE
TIME HE FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE AND HOMAGE OF THE GREAT AFFLICTED AND
EMBARRASSED HIM LESS AND LESS SHARPLY WITH EVERY HOUR THAT DRIFTED OVER
HIS HEAD
BUT FOR ONE SINGLE DREAD HE COULD HAVE SEEN THE FOURTH DAY APPROACH
WITHOUT SERIOUS DISTRESS THE DINING IN PUBLIC IT WAS TO BEGIN THAT
DAY
THERE WERE GREATER MATTERS IN THE PROGRAMME FOR ON THAT DAY
HE WOULD HAVE TO PRESIDE AT A COUNCIL WHICH WOULD TAKE HIS VIEWS AND
COMMANDS CONCERNING THE POLICY TO BE PURSUED TOWARD VARIOUS FOREIGN
NATIONS SCATTERED FAR AND NEAR OVER THE GREAT GLOBE ON THAT DAY TOO
HERTFORD WOULD BE FORMALLY CHOSEN TO THE GRAND OFFICE OF LORD PROTECTOR
OTHER THINGS OF NOTE WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT FOURTH DAY ALSO BUT TO
TOM THEY WERE ALL INSIGNIFICANT COMPARED WITH THE ORDEAL OF DINING ALL
BY HIMSELF WITH A MULTITUDE OF CURIOUS EYES FASTENED UPON HIM AND A
MULTITUDE OF MOUTHS WHISPERING COMMENTS UPON HIS PERFORMANCE AND UPON
HIS MISTAKES IF HE SHOULD BE SO UNLUCKY AS TO MAKE ANY
STILL NOTHING COULD STOP THAT FOURTH DAY AND SO IT CAME
IT FOUND
POOR TOM LOW SPIRITED AND ABSENT MINDED AND THIS MOOD CONTINUED HE
COULD NOT SHAKE IT OFF
THE ORDINARY DUTIES OF THE MORNING DRAGGED UPON
HIS HANDS AND WEARIED HIM
ONCE MORE HE FELT THE SENSE OF CAPTIVITY
HEAVY UPON HIM
LATE IN THE FORENOON HE WAS IN A LARGE AUDIENCE CHAMBER CONVERSING
WITH THE EARL OF HERTFORD AND DULLY AWAITING THE STRIKING OF THE HOUR
APPOINTED FOR A VISIT OF CEREMONY FROM A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF GREAT
OFFICIALS AND COURTIERS
AFTER A LITTLE WHILE TOM WHO HAD WANDERED TO A WINDOW AND BECOME
INTERESTED IN THE LIFE AND MOVEMENT OF THE GREAT HIGHWAY BEYOND THE
PALACE GATES AND NOT IDLY INTERESTED BUT LONGING WITH ALL HIS HEART
TO TAKE PART IN PERSON IN ITS STIR AND FREEDOM SAW THE VAN OF A HOOTING
AND SHOUTING MOB OF DISORDERLY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF THE LOWEST
AND POOREST DEGREE APPROACHING FROM UP THE ROAD
I WOULD I KNEW WHAT 'TIS ABOUT HE EXCLAIMED WITH ALL A BOY'S
CURIOSITY IN SUCH HAPPENINGS
THOU ART THE KING SOLEMNLY RESPONDED THE EARL WITH A REVERENCE
HAVE I YOUR GRACE'S LEAVE TO ACT
O BLITHELY YES O GLADLY YES EXCLAIMED TOM EXCITEDLY ADDING TO
HIMSELF WITH A LIVELY SENSE OF SATISFACTION IN TRUTH BEING A KING IS
NOT ALL DREARINESS IT HATH ITS COMPENSATIONS AND CONVENIENCES
THE EARL CALLED A PAGE AND SENT HIM TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD WITH
THE ORDER
LET THE MOB BE HALTED AND INQUIRY MADE CONCERNING THE OCCASION OF ITS
MOVEMENT
BY THE KING'S COMMAND
A FEW SECONDS LATER A LONG RANK OF THE ROYAL GUARDS CASED IN FLASHING
STEEL FILED OUT AT THE GATES AND FORMED ACROSS THE HIGHWAY IN FRONT
OF THE MULTITUDE
A MESSENGER RETURNED TO REPORT THAT THE CROWD WERE
FOLLOWING A MAN A WOMAN AND A YOUNG GIRL TO EXECUTION FOR CRIMES
COMMITTED AGAINST THE PEACE AND DIGNITY OF THE REALM
DEATH AND A VIOLENT DEATH FOR THESE POOR UNFORTUNATES THE THOUGHT
WRUNG TOM'S HEART STRINGS
THE SPIRIT OF COMPASSION TOOK CONTROL OF
HIM TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER CONSIDERATIONS HE NEVER THOUGHT OF
THE OFFENDED LAWS OR OF THE GRIEF OR LOSS WHICH THESE THREE CRIMINALS
HAD INFLICTED UPON THEIR VICTIMS HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE
SCAFFOLD AND THE GRISLY FATE HANGING OVER THE HEADS OF THE CONDEMNED
HIS CONCERN MADE HIM EVEN FORGET FOR THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS BUT THE
FALSE SHADOW OF A KING NOT THE SUBSTANCE AND BEFORE HE KNEW IT HE HAD
BLURTED OUT THE COMMAND
BRING THEM HERE
THEN HE BLUSHED SCARLET AND A SORT OF APOLOGY SPRUNG TO HIS LIPS BUT
OBSERVING THAT HIS ORDER HAD WROUGHT NO SORT OF SURPRISE IN THE EARL OR
THE WAITING PAGE HE SUPPRESSED THE WORDS HE WAS ABOUT TO UTTER
THE
PAGE IN THE MOST MATTER OF COURSE WAY MADE A PROFOUND OBEISANCE
AND RETIRED BACKWARDS OUT OF THE ROOM TO DELIVER THE COMMAND
TOM
EXPERIENCED A GLOW OF PRIDE AND A RENEWED SENSE OF THE COMPENSATING
ADVANTAGES OF THE KINGLY OFFICE
HE SAID TO HIMSELF TRULY IT IS LIKE
WHAT I WAS USED TO FEEL WHEN I READ THE OLD PRIEST'S TALES AND DID
IMAGINE MINE OWN SELF A PRINCE GIVING LAW AND COMMAND TO ALL SAYING
'DO THIS DO THAT WHILST NONE DURST OFFER LET OR HINDRANCE TO MY
WILL
NOW THE DOORS SWUNG OPEN ONE HIGH SOUNDING TITLE AFTER ANOTHER WAS
ANNOUNCED THE PERSONAGES OWNING THEM FOLLOWED AND THE PLACE WAS
QUICKLY HALF FILLED WITH NOBLE FOLK AND FINERY
BUT TOM WAS HARDLY
CONSCIOUS OF THE PRESENCE OF THESE PEOPLE SO WROUGHT UP WAS HE AND SO
INTENSELY ABSORBED IN THAT OTHER AND MORE INTERESTING MATTER
HE SEATED
HIMSELF ABSENTLY IN HIS CHAIR OF STATE AND TURNED HIS EYES UPON THE
DOOR WITH MANIFESTATIONS OF IMPATIENT EXPECTANCY SEEING WHICH THE
COMPANY FORBORE TO TROUBLE HIM AND FELL TO CHATTING A MIXTURE OF PUBLIC
BUSINESS AND COURT GOSSIP ONE WITH ANOTHER
IN A LITTLE WHILE THE MEASURED TREAD OF MILITARY MEN WAS HEARD
APPROACHING AND THE CULPRITS ENTERED THE PRESENCE IN CHARGE OF AN
UNDER SHERIFF AND ESCORTED BY A DETAIL OF THE KING'S GUARD
THE CIVIL
OFFICER KNELT BEFORE TOM THEN STOOD ASIDE THE THREE DOOMED PERSONS
KNELT ALSO AND REMAINED SO THE GUARD TOOK POSITION BEHIND TOM'S
CHAIR
TOM SCANNED THE PRISONERS CURIOUSLY
SOMETHING ABOUT THE DRESS
OR APPEARANCE OF THE MAN HAD STIRRED A VAGUE MEMORY IN HIM
METHINKS
I HAVE SEEN THIS MAN ERE NOW
BUT THE WHEN OR THE WHERE FAIL
ME SUCH WAS TOM'S THOUGHT
JUST THEN THE MAN GLANCED QUICKLY UP AND
QUICKLY DROPPED HIS FACE AGAIN NOT BEING ABLE TO ENDURE THE AWFUL PORT
OF SOVEREIGNTY BUT THE ONE FULL GLIMPSE OF THE FACE WHICH TOM GOT WAS
SUFFICIENT
HE SAID TO HIMSELF NOW IS THE MATTER CLEAR THIS IS THE
STRANGER THAT PLUCKED GILES WITT OUT OF THE THAMES AND SAVED HIS LIFE
THAT WINDY BITTER FIRST DAY OF THE NEW YEAR A BRAVE GOOD DEED PITY
HE HATH BEEN DOING BASER ONES AND GOT HIMSELF IN THIS SAD CASE
I
HAVE NOT FORGOT THE DAY NEITHER THE HOUR BY REASON THAT AN HOUR AFTER
UPON THE STROKE OF ELEVEN I DID GET A HIDING BY THE HAND OF GAMMER
CANTY WHICH WAS OF SO GOODLY AND ADMIRED SEVERITY THAT ALL THAT
WENT BEFORE OR FOLLOWED AFTER IT WERE BUT FONDLINGS AND CARESSES BY
COMPARISON
TOM NOW ORDERED THAT THE WOMAN AND THE GIRL BE REMOVED FROM THE PRESENCE
FOR A LITTLE TIME THEN ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE UNDER SHERIFF SAYING
GOOD SIR WHAT IS THIS MAN'S OFFENCE
THE OFFICER KNELT AND ANSWERED
SO PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY HE HATH TAKEN THE LIFE OF A SUBJECT BY POISON
TOM'S COMPASSION FOR THE PRISONER AND ADMIRATION OF HIM AS THE DARING
RESCUER OF A DROWNING BOY EXPERIENCED A MOST DAMAGING SHOCK
THE THING WAS PROVEN UPON HIM HE ASKED
MOST CLEARLY SIRE
TOM SIGHED AND SAID
TAKE HIM AWAY HE HATH EARNED HIS DEATH
'TIS A PITY FOR HE WAS A
BRAVE HEART NA NA I MEAN HE HATH THE LOOK OF IT
THE PRISONER CLASPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER WITH SUDDEN ENERGY AND WRUNG
THEM DESPAIRINGLY AT THE SAME TIME APPEALING IMPLORINGLY TO THE 'KING'
IN BROKEN AND TERRIFIED PHRASES
O MY LORD THE KING AN' THOU CANST PITY THE LOST HAVE PITY UPON ME I
AM INNOCENT NEITHER HATH THAT WHEREWITH I AM CHARGED BEEN MORE THAN
BUT LAMELY PROVED YET I SPEAK NOT OF THAT THE JUDGMENT IS GONE FORTH
AGAINST ME AND MAY NOT SUFFER ALTERATION YET IN MINE EXTREMITY I BEG A
BOON FOR MY DOOM IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
A GRACE A GRACE MY LORD THE
KING IN THY ROYAL COMPASSION GRANT MY PRAYER GIVE COMMANDMENT THAT I
BE HANGED
TOM WAS AMAZED
THIS WAS NOT THE OUTCOME HE HAD LOOKED FOR
ODDS MY LIFE A STRANGE BOON WAS IT NOT THE FATE INTENDED THEE
O GOOD MY LIEGE NOT SO IT IS ORDERED THAT I BE BOILED ALIVE
THE HIDEOUS SURPRISE OF THESE WORDS ALMOST MADE TOM SPRING FROM HIS
CHAIR
AS SOON AS HE COULD RECOVER HIS WITS HE CRIED OUT
HAVE THY WISH POOR SOUL AN' THOU HAD POISONED A HUNDRED MEN THOU
SHOULDST NOT SUFFER SO MISERABLE A DEATH
THE PRISONER BOWED HIS FACE TO THE GROUND AND BURST INTO PASSIONATE
EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE ENDING WITH
IF EVER THOU SHOULDST KNOW MISFORTUNE WHICH GOD FOREFEND MAY THY
GOODNESS TO ME THIS DAY BE REMEMBERED AND REQUITED
TOM TURNED TO THE EARL OF HERTFORD AND SAID
MY LORD IS IT BELIEVABLE THAT THERE WAS WARRANT FOR THIS MAN'S
FEROCIOUS DOOM
IT IS THE LAW YOUR GRACE FOR POISONERS
IN GERMANY COINERS BE BOILED
TO DEATH IN OIL NOT CAST IN OF A SUDDEN BUT BY A ROPE LET DOWN INTO
THE OIL BY DEGREES AND SLOWLY FIRST THE FEET THEN THE LEGS THEN
O PRITHEE NO MORE MY LORD I CANNOT BEAR IT CRIED TOM COVERING
HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS TO SHUT OUT THE PICTURE
I BESEECH YOUR GOOD
LORDSHIP THAT ORDER BE TAKEN TO CHANGE THIS LAW OH LET NO MORE POOR
CREATURES BE VISITED WITH ITS TORTURES
THE EARL'S FACE SHOWED PROFOUND GRATIFICATION FOR HE WAS A MAN OF
MERCIFUL AND GENEROUS IMPULSES A THING NOT VERY COMMON WITH HIS CLASS
IN THAT FIERCE AGE
HE SAID
THESE YOUR GRACE'S NOBLE WORDS HAVE SEALED ITS DOOM
HISTORY WILL
REMEMBER IT TO THE HONOUR OF YOUR ROYAL HOUSE
THE UNDER SHERIFF WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE HIS PRISONER TOM GAVE HIM A SIGN
TO WAIT THEN HE SAID
GOOD SIR I WOULD LOOK INTO THIS MATTER FURTHER
THE MAN HAS SAID HIS
DEED WAS BUT LAMELY PROVED
TELL ME WHAT THOU KNOWEST
IF THE KING'S GRACE PLEASE IT DID APPEAR UPON THE TRIAL THAT THIS
MAN ENTERED INTO A HOUSE IN THE HAMLET OF ISLINGTON WHERE ONE LAY
SICK THREE WITNESSES SAY IT WAS AT TEN OF THE CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND
TWO SAY IT WAS SOME MINUTES LATER THE SICK MAN BEING ALONE AT THE TIME
AND SLEEPING AND PRESENTLY THE MAN CAME FORTH AGAIN AND WENT HIS
WAY
THE SICK MAN DIED WITHIN THE HOUR BEING TORN WITH SPASMS AND
RETCHINGS
DID ANY SEE THE POISON GIVEN WAS POISON FOUND
MARRY NO MY LIEGE
THEN HOW DOTH ONE KNOW THERE WAS POISON GIVEN AT ALL
PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY THE DOCTORS TESTIFIED THAT NONE DIE WITH SUCH
SYMPTOMS BUT BY POISON
WEIGHTY EVIDENCE THIS IN THAT SIMPLE AGE
TOM RECOGNISED ITS
FORMIDABLE NATURE AND SAID
THE DOCTOR KNOWETH HIS TRADE BELIKE THEY WERE RIGHT
THE MATTER HATH
AN ILL LOOK FOR THIS POOR MAN
YET WAS NOT THIS ALL YOUR MAJESTY THERE IS MORE AND WORSE
MANY
TESTIFIED THAT A WITCH SINCE GONE FROM THE VILLAGE NONE KNOW WHITHER
DID FORETELL AND SPEAK IT PRIVATELY IN THEIR EARS THAT THE SICK
MAN WOULD DIE BY POISON AND MORE THAT A STRANGER WOULD GIVE IT A
STRANGER WITH BROWN HAIR AND CLOTHED IN A WORN AND COMMON GARB AND
SURELY THIS PRISONER DOTH ANSWER WOUNDILY TO THE BILL
PLEASE YOUR
MAJESTY TO GIVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SOLEMN WEIGHT WHICH IS ITS DUE
SEEING IT WAS FORETOLD
THIS WAS AN ARGUMENT OF TREMENDOUS FORCE IN THAT SUPERSTITIOUS DAY
TOM
FELT THAT THE THING WAS SETTLED IF EVIDENCE WAS WORTH ANYTHING THIS
POOR FELLOW'S GUILT WAS PROVED
STILL HE OFFERED THE PRISONER A CHANCE
SAYING
IF THOU CANST SAY AUGHT IN THY BEHALF SPEAK
NOUGHT THAT WILL AVAIL MY KING
I AM INNOCENT YET CANNOT I MAKE
IT APPEAR
I HAVE NO FRIENDS ELSE MIGHT I SHOW THAT I WAS NOT IN
ISLINGTON THAT DAY SO ALSO MIGHT I SHOW THAT AT THAT HOUR THEY NAME I
WAS ABOVE A LEAGUE AWAY SEEING I WAS AT WAPPING OLD STAIRS YEA MORE
MY KING FOR I COULD SHOW THAT WHILST THEY SAY I WAS TAKING LIFE I
WAS SAVING IT
A DROWNING BOY
PEACE SHERIFF NAME THE DAY THE DEED WAS DONE
AT TEN IN THE MORNING OR SOME MINUTES LATER THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEW
YEAR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
LET THE PRISONER GO FREE IT IS THE KING'S WILL
ANOTHER BLUSH FOLLOWED THIS UNREGAL OUTBURST AND HE COVERED HIS
INDECORUM AS WELL AS HE COULD BY ADDING
IT ENRAGETH ME THAT A MAN SHOULD BE HANGED UPON SUCH IDLE HARE BRAINED
EVIDENCE
A LOW BUZZ OF ADMIRATION SWEPT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLAGE
IT WAS NOT
ADMIRATION OF THE DECREE THAT HAD BEEN DELIVERED BY TOM FOR THE
PROPRIETY OR EXPEDIENCY OF PARDONING A CONVICTED POISONER WAS A THING
WHICH FEW THERE WOULD HAVE FELT JUSTIFIED IN EITHER ADMITTING OR
ADMIRING NO THE ADMIRATION WAS FOR THE INTELLIGENCE AND SPIRIT WHICH
TOM HAD DISPLAYED
SOME OF THE LOW VOICED REMARKS WERE TO THIS EFFECT
THIS IS NO MAD KING HE HATH HIS WITS SOUND
HOW SANELY HE PUT HIS QUESTIONS HOW LIKE HIS FORMER NATURAL SELF WAS
THIS ABRUPT IMPERIOUS DISPOSAL OF THE MATTER
GOD BE THANKED HIS INFIRMITY IS SPENT THIS IS NO WEAKLING BUT A
KING
HE HATH BORNE HIMSELF LIKE TO HIS OWN FATHER
THE AIR BEING FILLED WITH APPLAUSE TOM'S EAR NECESSARILY CAUGHT A
LITTLE OF IT
THE EFFECT WHICH THIS HAD UPON HIM WAS TO PUT HIM
GREATLY AT HIS EASE AND ALSO TO CHARGE HIS SYSTEM WITH VERY GRATIFYING
SENSATIONS
HOWEVER HIS JUVENILE CURIOSITY SOON ROSE SUPERIOR TO THESE PLEASANT
THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS HE WAS EAGER TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF DEADLY MISCHIEF
THE WOMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL COULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT SO BY HIS COMMAND
THE TWO TERRIFIED AND SOBBING CREATURES WERE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM
WHAT IS IT THAT THESE HAVE DONE HE INQUIRED OF THE SHERIFF
PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY A BLACK CRIME IS CHARGED UPON THEM AND CLEARLY
PROVEN WHEREFORE THE JUDGES HAVE DECREED ACCORDING TO THE LAW THAT
THEY BE HANGED
THEY SOLD THEMSELVES TO THE DEVIL SUCH IS THEIR
CRIME
TOM SHUDDERED
HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO ABHOR PEOPLE WHO DID THIS WICKED
THING
STILL HE WAS NOT GOING TO DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF FEEDING
HIS CURIOSITY FOR ALL THAT SO HE ASKED
WHERE WAS THIS DONE AND WHEN
ON A MIDNIGHT IN DECEMBER IN A RUINED CHURCH YOUR MAJESTY
TOM SHUDDERED AGAIN
WHO WAS THERE PRESENT
ONLY THESE TWO YOUR GRACE AND THAT OTHER
HAVE THESE CONFESSED
NAY NOT SO SIRE THEY DO DENY IT
THEN PRITHEE HOW WAS IT KNOWN
CERTAIN WITNESS DID SEE THEM WENDING THITHER GOOD YOUR MAJESTY THIS
BRED THE SUSPICION AND DIRE EFFECTS HAVE SINCE CONFIRMED AND JUSTIFIED
IT
IN PARTICULAR IT IS IN EVIDENCE THAT THROUGH THE WICKED POWER SO
OBTAINED THEY DID INVOKE AND BRING ABOUT A STORM THAT WASTED ALL THE
REGION ROUND ABOUT
ABOVE FORTY WITNESSES HAVE PROVED THE STORM AND
SOOTH ONE MIGHT HAVE HAD A THOUSAND FOR ALL HAD REASON TO REMEMBER IT
SITH ALL HAD SUFFERED BY IT
CERTES THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER TOM TURNED THIS DARK PIECE OF
SCOUNDRELISM OVER IN HIS MIND A WHILE THEN ASKED
SUFFERED THE WOMAN ALSO BY THE STORM
SEVERAL OLD HEADS AMONG THE ASSEMBLAGE NODDED THEIR RECOGNITION OF
THE WISDOM OF THIS QUESTION
THE SHERIFF HOWEVER SAW NOTHING
CONSEQUENTIAL IN THE INQUIRY HE ANSWERED WITH SIMPLE DIRECTNESS
INDEED DID SHE YOUR MAJESTY AND MOST RIGHTEOUSLY AS ALL AVER
HER
HABITATION WAS SWEPT AWAY AND HERSELF AND CHILD LEFT SHELTERLESS
METHINKS THE POWER TO DO HERSELF SO ILL A TURN WAS DEARLY BOUGHT
SHE
HAD BEEN CHEATED HAD SHE PAID BUT A FARTHING FOR IT THAT SHE PAID
HER SOUL AND HER CHILD'S ARGUETH THAT SHE IS MAD IF SHE IS MAD SHE
KNOWETH NOT WHAT SHE DOTH THEREFORE SINNETH NOT
THE ELDERLY HEADS NODDED RECOGNITION OF TOM'S WISDOM ONCE MORE AND ONE
INDIVIDUAL MURMURED AN' THE KING BE MAD HIMSELF ACCORDING TO REPORT
THEN IS IT A MADNESS OF A SORT THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE SANITY OF SOME I
WOT OF IF BY THE GENTLE PROVIDENCE OF GOD THEY COULD BUT CATCH IT
WHAT AGE HATH THE CHILD ASKED TOM
NINE YEARS PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY
BY THE LAW OF ENGLAND MAY A CHILD ENTER INTO COVENANT AND SELL ITSELF
MY LORD ASKED TOM TURNING TO A LEARNED JUDGE
THE LAW DOTH NOT PERMIT A CHILD TO MAKE OR MEDDLE IN ANY WEIGHTY
MATTER GOOD MY LIEGE HOLDING THAT ITS CALLOW WIT UNFITTETH IT TO COPE
WITH THE RIPER WIT AND EVIL SCHEMINGS OF THEM THAT ARE ITS ELDERS
THE
DEVIL MAY BUY A CHILD IF HE SO CHOOSE AND THE CHILD AGREE THERETO
BUT NOT AN ENGLISHMAN IN THIS LATTER CASE THE CONTRACT WOULD BE NULL
AND VOID
IT SEEMETH A RUDE UNCHRISTIAN THING AND ILL CONTRIVED THAT ENGLISH
LAW DENIETH PRIVILEGES TO ENGLISHMEN TO WASTE THEM ON THE DEVIL CRIED
TOM WITH HONEST HEAT
THIS NOVEL VIEW OF THE MATTER EXCITED MANY SMILES AND WAS STORED
AWAY IN MANY HEADS TO BE REPEATED ABOUT THE COURT AS EVIDENCE OF TOM'S
ORIGINALITY AS WELL AS PROGRESS TOWARD MENTAL HEALTH
THE ELDER CULPRIT HAD CEASED FROM SOBBING AND WAS HANGING UPON TOM'S
WORDS WITH AN EXCITED INTEREST AND A GROWING HOPE
TOM NOTICED THIS
AND IT STRONGLY INCLINED HIS SYMPATHIES TOWARD HER IN HER PERILOUS AND
UNFRIENDED SITUATION
PRESENTLY HE ASKED
HOW WROUGHT THEY TO BRING THE STORM
BY PULLING OFF THEIR STOCKINGS SIRE
THIS ASTONISHED TOM AND ALSO FIRED HIS CURIOSITY TO FEVER HEAT
HE
SAID EAGERLY
IT IS WONDERFUL HATH IT ALWAYS THIS DREAD EFFECT
ALWAYS MY LIEGE AT LEAST IF THE WOMAN DESIRE IT AND UTTER THE
NEEDFUL WORDS EITHER IN HER MIND OR WITH HER TONGUE
TOM TURNED TO THE WOMAN AND SAID WITH IMPETUOUS ZEAL
EXERT THY POWER I WOULD SEE A STORM
THERE WAS A SUDDEN PALING OF CHEEKS IN THE SUPERSTITIOUS ASSEMBLAGE AND
A GENERAL THOUGH UNEXPRESSED DESIRE TO GET OUT OF THE PLACE ALL OF
WHICH WAS LOST UPON TOM WHO WAS DEAD TO EVERYTHING BUT THE PROPOSED
CATACLYSM
SEEING A PUZZLED AND ASTONISHED LOOK IN THE WOMAN'S FACE HE
ADDED EXCITEDLY
NEVER FEAR THOU SHALT BE BLAMELESS
MORE THOU SHALT GO FREE NONE
SHALL TOUCH THEE
EXERT THY POWER
OH MY LORD THE KING I HAVE IT NOT I HAVE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED
THY FEARS STAY THEE
BE OF GOOD HEART THOU SHALT SUFFER NO HARM
MAKE A STORM IT MATTERETH NOT HOW SMALL A ONE I REQUIRE NOUGHT GREAT
OR HARMFUL BUT INDEED PREFER THE OPPOSITE DO THIS AND THY LIFE IS
SPARED THOU SHALT GO OUT FREE WITH THY CHILD BEARING THE KING'S
PARDON AND SAFE FROM HURT OR MALICE FROM ANY IN THE REALM
THE WOMAN PROSTRATED HERSELF AND PROTESTED WITH TEARS THAT SHE HAD
NO POWER TO DO THE MIRACLE ELSE SHE WOULD GLADLY WIN HER CHILD'S LIFE
ALONE AND BE CONTENT TO LOSE HER OWN IF BY OBEDIENCE TO THE KING'S
COMMAND SO PRECIOUS A GRACE MIGHT BE ACQUIRED
TOM URGED THE WOMAN STILL ADHERED TO HER DECLARATIONS
FINALLY HE
SAID
I THINK THE WOMAN HATH SAID TRUE
AN' MY MOTHER WERE IN HER PLACE
AND GIFTED WITH THE DEVIL'S FUNCTIONS SHE HAD NOT STAYED A MOMENT TO
CALL HER STORMS AND LAY THE WHOLE LAND IN RUINS IF THE SAVING OF MY
FORFEIT LIFE WERE THE PRICE SHE GOT IT IS ARGUMENT THAT OTHER
MOTHERS ARE MADE IN LIKE MOULD
THOU ART FREE GOODWIFE THOU AND THY
CHILD FOR I DO THINK THEE INNOCENT
NOW THOU'ST NOUGHT TO FEAR
BEING PARDONED PULL OFF THY STOCKINGS AN' THOU CANST MAKE ME A STORM
THOU SHALT BE RICH
THE REDEEMED CREATURE WAS LOUD IN HER GRATITUDE AND PROCEEDED TO
OBEY WHILST TOM LOOKED ON WITH EAGER EXPECTANCY A LITTLE MARRED
BY APPREHENSION THE COURTIERS AT THE SAME TIME MANIFESTING DECIDED
DISCOMFORT AND UNEASINESS
THE WOMAN STRIPPED HER OWN FEET AND HER
LITTLE GIRL'S ALSO AND PLAINLY DID HER BEST TO REWARD THE KING'S
GENEROSITY WITH AN EARTHQUAKE BUT IT WAS ALL A FAILURE AND A
DISAPPOINTMENT
TOM SIGHED AND SAID
THERE GOOD SOUL TROUBLE THYSELF NO FURTHER THY POWER IS DEPARTED
OUT OF THEE
GO THY WAY IN PEACE AND IF IT RETURN TO THEE AT ANY TIME
FORGET ME NOT BUT FETCH ME A STORM 13
CHAPTER XVI
THE STATE DINNER
THE DINNER HOUR DREW NEAR YET STRANGELY ENOUGH THE THOUGHT BROUGHT
BUT SLIGHT DISCOMFORT TO TOM AND HARDLY ANY TERROR
THE MORNING'S
EXPERIENCES HAD WONDERFULLY BUILT UP HIS CONFIDENCE THE POOR LITTLE
ASH CAT WAS ALREADY MORE WONTED TO HIS STRANGE GARRET AFTER FOUR
DAYS' HABIT THAN A MATURE PERSON COULD HAVE BECOME IN A FULL MONTH
A
CHILD'S FACILITY IN ACCOMMODATING ITSELF TO CIRCUMSTANCES WAS NEVER MORE
STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATED
LET US PRIVILEGED ONES HURRY TO THE GREAT BANQUETING ROOM AND HAVE A
GLANCE AT MATTERS THERE WHILST TOM IS BEING MADE READY FOR THE
IMPOSING OCCASION
IT IS A SPACIOUS APARTMENT WITH GILDED PILLARS
AND PILASTERS AND PICTURED WALLS AND CEILINGS
AT THE DOOR STAND TALL
GUARDS AS RIGID AS STATUES DRESSED IN RICH AND PICTURESQUE COSTUMES
AND BEARING HALBERDS
IN A HIGH GALLERY WHICH RUNS ALL AROUND THE PLACE
IS A BAND OF MUSICIANS AND A PACKED COMPANY OF CITIZENS OF BOTH SEXES
IN BRILLIANT ATTIRE
IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM UPON A RAISED PLATFORM
IS TOM'S TABLE
NOW LET THE ANCIENT CHRONICLER SPEAK
A GENTLEMAN ENTERS THE ROOM BEARING A ROD AND ALONG WITH HIM ANOTHER
BEARING A TABLECLOTH WHICH AFTER THEY HAVE BOTH KNEELED THREE TIMES
WITH THE UTMOST VENERATION HE SPREADS UPON THE TABLE AND AFTER
KNEELING AGAIN THEY BOTH RETIRE THEN COME TWO OTHERS ONE WITH THE ROD
AGAIN THE OTHER WITH A SALT CELLAR A PLATE AND BREAD WHEN THEY HAVE
KNEELED AS THE OTHERS HAD DONE AND PLACED WHAT WAS BROUGHT UPON THE
TABLE THEY TOO RETIRE WITH THE SAME CEREMONIES PERFORMED BY THE FIRST
AT LAST COME TWO NOBLES RICHLY CLOTHED ONE BEARING A TASTING KNIFE
WHO AFTER PROSTRATING THEMSELVES THREE TIMES IN THE MOST GRACEFUL
MANNER APPROACH AND RUB THE TABLE WITH BREAD AND SALT WITH AS MUCH AWE
AS IF THE KING HAD BEEN PRESENT 6
SO END THE SOLEMN PRELIMINARIES
NOW FAR DOWN THE ECHOING CORRIDORS
WE HEAR A BUGLE BLAST AND THE INDISTINCT CRY PLACE FOR THE KING
WAY FOR THE KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY THESE SOUNDS ARE MOMENTLY
REPEATED THEY GROW NEARER AND NEARER AND PRESENTLY ALMOST IN OUR
FACES THE MARTIAL NOTE PEALS AND THE CRY RINGS OUT WAY FOR THE KING
AT THIS INSTANT THE SHINING PAGEANT APPEARS AND FILES IN AT THE DOOR
WITH A MEASURED MARCH
LET THE CHRONICLER SPEAK AGAIN
FIRST COME GENTLEMEN BARONS EARLS KNIGHTS OF THE GARTER ALL RICHLY
DRESSED AND BAREHEADED NEXT COMES THE CHANCELLOR BETWEEN TWO ONE OF
WHICH CARRIES THE ROYAL SCEPTRE THE OTHER THE SWORD OF STATE IN A RED
SCABBARD STUDDED WITH GOLDEN FLEURS DE LIS THE POINT UPWARDS NEXT
COMES THE KING HIMSELF WHOM UPON HIS APPEARING TWELVE TRUMPETS AND
MANY DRUMS SALUTE WITH A GREAT BURST OF WELCOME WHILST ALL IN THE
GALLERIES RISE IN THEIR PLACES CRYING 'GOD SAVE THE KING AFTER HIM
COME NOBLES ATTACHED TO HIS PERSON AND ON HIS RIGHT AND LEFT MARCH HIS
GUARD OF HONOUR HIS FIFTY GENTLEMEN PENSIONERS WITH GILT BATTLE AXES
THIS WAS ALL FINE AND PLEASANT
TOM'S PULSE BEAT HIGH AND A GLAD LIGHT
WAS IN HIS EYE
HE BORE HIMSELF RIGHT GRACEFULLY AND ALL THE MORE
SO BECAUSE HE WAS NOT THINKING OF HOW HE WAS DOING IT HIS MIND BEING
CHARMED AND OCCUPIED WITH THE BLITHE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS ABOUT HIM AND
BESIDES NOBODY CAN BE VERY UNGRACEFUL IN NICELY FITTING BEAUTIFUL
CLOTHES AFTER HE HAS GROWN A LITTLE USED TO THEM ESPECIALLY IF HE IS
FOR THE MOMENT UNCONSCIOUS OF THEM
TOM REMEMBERED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND
ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GREETING WITH A SLIGHT INCLINATION OF HIS PLUMED HEAD
AND A COURTEOUS I THANK YE MY GOOD PEOPLE
HE SEATED HIMSELF AT TABLE WITHOUT REMOVING HIS CAP AND DID IT WITHOUT
THE LEAST EMBARRASSMENT FOR TO EAT WITH ONE'S CAP ON WAS THE ONE
SOLITARY ROYAL CUSTOM UPON WHICH THE KINGS AND THE CANTYS MET UPON
COMMON GROUND NEITHER PARTY HAVING ANY ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER IN THE
MATTER OF OLD FAMILIARITY WITH IT
THE PAGEANT BROKE UP AND GROUPED
ITSELF PICTURESQUELY AND REMAINED BAREHEADED
NOW TO THE SOUND OF GAY MUSIC THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD ENTERED THE
TALLEST AND MIGHTIEST MEN IN ENGLAND THEY BEING CAREFULLY SELECTED IN
THIS REGARD BUT WE WILL LET THE CHRONICLER TELL ABOUT IT
THE YEOMEN OF THE GUARD ENTERED BAREHEADED CLOTHED IN SCARLET WITH
GOLDEN ROSES UPON THEIR BACKS AND THESE WENT AND CAME BRINGING IN EACH
TURN A COURSE OF DISHES SERVED IN PLATE
THESE DISHES WERE RECEIVED
BY A GENTLEMAN IN THE SAME ORDER THEY WERE BROUGHT AND PLACED UPON
THE TABLE WHILE THE TASTER GAVE TO EACH GUARD A MOUTHFUL TO EAT OF THE
PARTICULAR DISH HE HAD BROUGHT FOR FEAR OF ANY POISON
TOM MADE A GOOD DINNER NOTWITHSTANDING HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HUNDREDS
OF EYES FOLLOWED EACH MORSEL TO HIS MOUTH AND WATCHED HIM EAT IT WITH AN
INTEREST WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE INTENSE IF IT HAD BEEN A DEADLY
EXPLOSIVE AND WAS EXPECTED TO BLOW HIM UP AND SCATTER HIM ALL ABOUT
THE PLACE
HE WAS CAREFUL NOT TO HURRY AND EQUALLY CAREFUL NOT TO DO
ANYTHING WHATEVER FOR HIMSELF BUT WAIT TILL THE PROPER OFFICIAL KNELT
DOWN AND DID IT FOR HIM
HE GOT THROUGH WITHOUT A MISTAKE FLAWLESS AND
PRECIOUS TRIUMPH
WHEN THE MEAL WAS OVER AT LAST AND HE MARCHED AWAY IN THE MIDST OF HIS
BRIGHT PAGEANT WITH THE HAPPY NOISES IN HIS EARS OF BLARING BUGLES
ROLLING DRUMS AND THUNDERING ACCLAMATIONS HE FELT THAT IF HE HAD SEEN
THE WORST OF DINING IN PUBLIC IT WAS AN ORDEAL WHICH HE WOULD BE GLAD
TO ENDURE SEVERAL TIMES A DAY IF BY THAT MEANS HE COULD BUT BUY HIMSELF
FREE FROM SOME OF THE MORE FORMIDABLE REQUIREMENTS OF HIS ROYAL OFFICE
CHAPTER XVII
FOO FOO THE FIRST
MILES HENDON HURRIED ALONG TOWARD THE SOUTHWARK END OF THE BRIDGE
KEEPING A SHARP LOOK OUT FOR THE PERSONS HE SOUGHT AND HOPING AND
EXPECTING TO OVERTAKE THEM PRESENTLY
HE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THIS
HOWEVER
BY ASKING QUESTIONS HE WAS ENABLED TO TRACK THEM PART OF THE
WAY THROUGH SOUTHWARK THEN ALL TRACES CEASED AND HE WAS PERPLEXED AS
TO HOW TO PROCEED
STILL HE CONTINUED HIS EFFORTS AS BEST HE
COULD DURING THE REST OF THE DAY
NIGHTFALL FOUND HIM LEG WEARY
HALF FAMISHED AND HIS DESIRE AS FAR FROM ACCOMPLISHMENT AS EVER SO
HE SUPPED AT THE TABARD INN AND WENT TO BED RESOLVED TO MAKE AN EARLY
START IN THE MORNING AND GIVE THE TOWN AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH
AS HE LAY
THINKING AND PLANNING HE PRESENTLY BEGAN TO REASON THUS THE BOY WOULD
ESCAPE FROM THE RUFFIAN HIS REPUTED FATHER IF POSSIBLE WOULD HE GO
BACK TO LONDON AND SEEK HIS FORMER HAUNTS NO HE WOULD NOT DO THAT
HE WOULD AVOID RECAPTURE
WHAT THEN WOULD HE DO NEVER HAVING HAD A
FRIEND IN THE WORLD OR A PROTECTOR UNTIL HE MET MILES HENDON HE WOULD
NATURALLY TRY TO FIND THAT FRIEND AGAIN PROVIDED THE EFFORT DID NOT
REQUIRE HIM TO GO TOWARD LONDON AND DANGER
HE WOULD STRIKE FOR HENDON
HALL THAT IS WHAT HE WOULD DO FOR HE KNEW HENDON WAS HOMEWARD BOUND
AND THERE HE MIGHT EXPECT TO FIND HIM
YES THE CASE WAS PLAIN TO
HENDON HE MUST LOSE NO MORE TIME IN SOUTHWARK BUT MOVE AT ONCE THROUGH
KENT TOWARD MONK'S HOLM SEARCHING THE WOOD AND INQUIRING AS HE WENT
LET US RETURN TO THE VANISHED LITTLE KING NOW
THE RUFFIAN WHOM THE WAITER AT THE INN ON THE BRIDGE SAW 'ABOUT TO JOIN'
THE YOUTH AND THE KING DID NOT EXACTLY JOIN THEM BUT FELL IN CLOSE
BEHIND THEM AND FOLLOWED THEIR STEPS
HE SAID NOTHING
HIS LEFT ARM WAS
IN A SLING AND HE WORE A LARGE GREEN PATCH OVER HIS LEFT EYE HE LIMPED
SLIGHTLY AND USED AN OAKEN STAFF AS A SUPPORT
THE YOUTH LED THE KING
A CROOKED COURSE THROUGH SOUTHWARK AND BY AND BY STRUCK INTO THE
HIGH ROAD BEYOND
THE KING WAS IRRITATED NOW AND SAID HE WOULD STOP
HERE IT WAS HENDON'S PLACE TO COME TO HIM NOT HIS TO GO TO HENDON
HE
WOULD NOT ENDURE SUCH INSOLENCE HE WOULD STOP WHERE HE WAS
THE YOUTH
SAID
THOU'LT TARRY HERE AND THY FRIEND LYING WOUNDED IN THE WOOD YONDER
SO BE IT THEN
THE KING'S MANNER CHANGED AT ONCE
HE CRIED OUT
WOUNDED AND WHO HATH DARED TO DO IT BUT THAT IS APART LEAD ON
LEAD ON FASTER SIRRAH ART SHOD WITH LEAD WOUNDED IS HE NOW
THOUGH THE DOER OF IT BE A DUKE'S SON HE SHALL RUE IT
IT WAS SOME DISTANCE TO THE WOOD BUT THE SPACE WAS SPEEDILY TRAVERSED
THE YOUTH LOOKED ABOUT HIM DISCOVERED A BOUGH STICKING IN THE GROUND
WITH A SMALL BIT OF RAG TIED TO IT THEN LED THE WAY INTO THE FOREST
WATCHING FOR SIMILAR BOUGHS AND FINDING THEM AT INTERVALS THEY WERE
EVIDENTLY GUIDES TO THE POINT HE WAS AIMING AT
BY AND BY AN OPEN PLACE
WAS REACHED WHERE WERE THE CHARRED REMAINS OF A FARM HOUSE AND NEAR
THEM A BARN WHICH WAS FALLING TO RUIN AND DECAY
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF
LIFE ANYWHERE AND UTTER SILENCE PREVAILED
THE YOUTH ENTERED THE BARN
THE KING FOLLOWING EAGERLY UPON HIS HEELS
NO ONE THERE THE KING SHOT
A SURPRISED AND SUSPICIOUS GLANCE AT THE YOUTH AND ASKED
WHERE IS HE
A MOCKING LAUGH WAS HIS ANSWER
THE KING WAS IN A RAGE IN A MOMENT HE
SEIZED A BILLET OF WOOD AND WAS IN THE ACT OF CHARGING UPON THE YOUTH
WHEN ANOTHER MOCKING LAUGH FELL UPON HIS EAR
IT WAS FROM THE LAME
RUFFIAN WHO HAD BEEN FOLLOWING AT A DISTANCE
THE KING TURNED AND SAID
ANGRILY
WHO ART THOU WHAT IS THY BUSINESS HERE
LEAVE THY FOOLERY SAID THE MAN AND QUIET THYSELF
MY DISGUISE IS
NONE SO GOOD THAT THOU CANST PRETEND THOU KNOWEST NOT THY FATHER THROUGH
IT
THOU ART NOT MY FATHER
I KNOW THEE NOT
I AM THE KING
IF THOU HAST
HID MY SERVANT FIND HIM FOR ME OR THOU SHALT SUP SORROW FOR WHAT THOU
HAST DONE
JOHN CANTY REPLIED IN A STERN AND MEASURED VOICE
IT IS PLAIN THOU ART MAD AND I AM LOATH TO PUNISH THEE BUT IF THOU
PROVOKE ME I MUST
THY PRATING DOTH NO HARM HERE WHERE THERE ARE
NO EARS THAT NEED TO MIND THY FOLLIES YET IT IS WELL TO PRACTISE THY
TONGUE TO WARY SPEECH THAT IT MAY DO NO HURT WHEN OUR QUARTERS CHANGE
I HAVE DONE A MURDER AND MAY NOT TARRY AT HOME NEITHER SHALT THOU
SEEING I NEED THY SERVICE
MY NAME IS CHANGED FOR WISE REASONS IT IS
HOBBS JOHN HOBBS THINE IS JACK CHARGE THY MEMORY ACCORDINGLY
NOW
THEN SPEAK
WHERE IS THY MOTHER WHERE ARE THY SISTERS THEY CAME
NOT TO THE PLACE APPOINTED KNOWEST THOU WHITHER THEY WENT
THE KING ANSWERED SULLENLY
TROUBLE ME NOT WITH THESE RIDDLES
MY MOTHER IS DEAD MY SISTERS ARE
IN THE PALACE
THE YOUTH NEAR BY BURST INTO A DERISIVE LAUGH AND THE KING WOULD HAVE
ASSAULTED HIM BUT CANTY OR HOBBS AS HE NOW CALLED HIMSELF PREVENTED
HIM AND SAID
PEACE HUGO VEX HIM NOT HIS MIND IS ASTRAY AND THY WAYS FRET HIM
SIT THEE DOWN JACK AND QUIET THYSELF THOU SHALT HAVE A MORSEL TO EAT
ANON
HOBBS AND HUGO FELL TO TALKING TOGETHER IN LOW VOICES AND THE KING
REMOVED HIMSELF AS FAR AS HE COULD FROM THEIR DISAGREEABLE COMPANY
HE WITHDREW INTO THE TWILIGHT OF THE FARTHER END OF THE BARN WHERE
HE FOUND THE EARTHEN FLOOR BEDDED A FOOT DEEP WITH STRAW
HE LAY DOWN
HERE DREW STRAW OVER HIMSELF IN LIEU OF BLANKETS AND WAS SOON ABSORBED
IN THINKING
HE HAD MANY GRIEFS BUT THE MINOR ONES WERE SWEPT ALMOST
INTO FORGETFULNESS BY THE SUPREME ONE THE LOSS OF HIS FATHER
TO
THE REST OF THE WORLD THE NAME OF HENRY VIII
BROUGHT A SHIVER AND
SUGGESTED AN OGRE WHOSE NOSTRILS BREATHED DESTRUCTION AND WHOSE HAND
DEALT SCOURGINGS AND DEATH BUT TO THIS BOY THE NAME BROUGHT ONLY
SENSATIONS OF PLEASURE THE FIGURE IT INVOKED WORE A COUNTENANCE THAT
WAS ALL GENTLENESS AND AFFECTION
HE CALLED TO MIND A LONG SUCCESSION
OF LOVING PASSAGES BETWEEN HIS FATHER AND HIMSELF AND DWELT FONDLY UPON
THEM HIS UNSTINTED TEARS ATTESTING HOW DEEP AND REAL WAS THE GRIEF THAT
POSSESSED HIS HEART
AS THE AFTERNOON WASTED AWAY THE LAD WEARIED WITH
HIS TROUBLES SANK GRADUALLY INTO A TRANQUIL AND HEALING SLUMBER
AFTER A CONSIDERABLE TIME HE COULD NOT TELL HOW LONG HIS SENSES
STRUGGLED TO A HALF CONSCIOUSNESS AND AS HE LAY WITH CLOSED EYES
VAGUELY WONDERING WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING HE NOTED A
MURMUROUS SOUND THE SULLEN BEATING OF RAIN UPON THE ROOF
A SNUG SENSE
OF COMFORT STOLE OVER HIM WHICH WAS RUDELY BROKEN THE NEXT MOMENT
BY A CHORUS OF PIPING CACKLES AND COARSE LAUGHTER
IT STARTLED HIM
DISAGREEABLY AND HE UNMUFFLED HIS HEAD TO SEE WHENCE THIS INTERRUPTION
PROCEEDED
A GRIM AND UNSIGHTLY PICTURE MET HIS EYE
A BRIGHT FIRE WAS
BURNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR AT THE OTHER END OF THE BARN AND
AROUND IT AND LIT WEIRDLY UP BY THE RED GLARE LOLLED AND SPRAWLED THE
MOTLIEST COMPANY OF TATTERED GUTTER SCUM AND RUFFIANS OF BOTH SEXES HE
HAD EVER READ OR DREAMED OF
THERE WERE HUGE STALWART MEN BROWN
WITH EXPOSURE LONG HAIRED AND CLOTHED IN FANTASTIC RAGS THERE WERE
MIDDLE SIZED YOUTHS OF TRUCULENT COUNTENANCE AND SIMILARLY CLAD THERE
WERE BLIND MENDICANTS WITH PATCHED OR BANDAGED EYES CRIPPLED ONES
WITH WOODEN LEGS AND CRUTCHES DISEASED ONES WITH RUNNING SORES PEEPING
FROM INEFFECTUAL WRAPPINGS THERE WAS A VILLAIN LOOKING PEDLAR WITH
HIS PACK A KNIFE GRINDER A TINKER AND A BARBER SURGEON WITH THE
IMPLEMENTS OF THEIR TRADES SOME OF THE FEMALES WERE HARDLY GROWN GIRLS
SOME WERE AT PRIME SOME WERE OLD AND WRINKLED HAGS AND ALL WERE LOUD
BRAZEN FOUL MOUTHED AND ALL SOILED AND SLATTERNLY THERE WERE THREE
SORE FACED BABIES THERE WERE A COUPLE OF STARVELING CURS WITH STRINGS
ABOUT THEIR NECKS WHOSE OFFICE WAS TO LEAD THE BLIND
THE NIGHT WAS COME THE GANG HAD JUST FINISHED FEASTING AN ORGY WAS
BEGINNING THE CAN OF LIQUOR WAS PASSING FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH
A GENERAL
CRY BROKE FORTH
A SONG A SONG FROM THE BAT AND DICK AND DOT AND GO ONE
ONE OF THE BLIND MEN GOT UP AND MADE READY BY CASTING ASIDE THE PATCHES
THAT SHELTERED HIS EXCELLENT EYES AND THE PATHETIC PLACARD WHICH
RECITED THE CAUSE OF HIS CALAMITY
DOT AND GO ONE DISENCUMBERED HIMSELF
OF HIS TIMBER LEG AND TOOK HIS PLACE UPON SOUND AND HEALTHY LIMBS
BESIDE HIS FELLOW RASCAL THEN THEY ROARED OUT A ROLLICKING DITTY
AND WERE REINFORCED BY THE WHOLE CREW AT THE END OF EACH STANZA IN
A ROUSING CHORUS
BY THE TIME THE LAST STANZA WAS REACHED THE
HALF DRUNKEN ENTHUSIASM HAD RISEN TO SUCH A PITCH THAT EVERYBODY JOINED
IN AND SANG IT CLEAR THROUGH FROM THE BEGINNING PRODUCING A VOLUME OF
VILLAINOUS SOUND THAT MADE THE RAFTERS QUAKE
THESE WERE THE INSPIRING
WORDS
'BIEN DARKMAN'S THEN BOUSE MORT AND KEN THE BIEN COVES BINGS AWAST ON
CHATES TO TRINE BY ROME COVES DINE FOR HIS LONG LIB AT LAST
BING'D OUT
BIEN MORTS AND TOURE AND TOURE BING OUT OF THE ROME VILE BINE AND
TOURE THE COVE THAT CLOY'D YOUR DUDS UPON THE CHATES TO TRINE
FROM'THE ENGLISH ROGUE LONDON 1665
CONVERSATION FOLLOWED NOT IN THE THIEVES' DIALECT OF THE SONG FOR THAT
WAS ONLY USED IN TALK WHEN UNFRIENDLY EARS MIGHT BE LISTENING
IN THE
COURSE OF IT IT APPEARED THAT 'JOHN HOBBS' WAS NOT ALTOGETHER A NEW
RECRUIT BUT HAD TRAINED IN THE GANG AT SOME FORMER TIME
HIS LATER
HISTORY WAS CALLED FOR AND WHEN HE SAID HE HAD 'ACCIDENTALLY' KILLED A
MAN CONSIDERABLE SATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED WHEN HE ADDED THAT THE
MAN WAS A PRIEST HE WAS ROUNDLY APPLAUDED AND HAD TO TAKE A DRINK WITH
EVERYBODY
OLD ACQUAINTANCES WELCOMED HIM JOYOUSLY AND NEW ONES WERE
PROUD TO SHAKE HIM BY THE HAND
HE WAS ASKED WHY HE HAD 'TARRIED AWAY
SO MANY MONTHS HE ANSWERED
LONDON IS BETTER THAN THE COUNTRY AND SAFER THESE LATE YEARS THE
LAWS BE SO BITTER AND SO DILIGENTLY ENFORCED
AN' I HAD NOT HAD THAT
ACCIDENT I HAD STAYED THERE
I HAD RESOLVED TO STAY AND NEVER MORE
VENTURE COUNTRY WARDS BUT THE ACCIDENT HAS ENDED THAT
HE INQUIRED HOW MANY PERSONS THE GANG NUMBERED NOW
THE 'RUFFLER OR
CHIEF ANSWERED
FIVE AND TWENTY STURDY BUDGES BULKS FILES CLAPPERDOGEONS AND
MAUNDERS COUNTING THE DELLS AND DOXIES AND OTHER MORTS
7 MOST ARE
HERE THE REST ARE WANDERING EASTWARD ALONG THE WINTER LAY
WE FOLLOW
AT DAWN
I DO NOT SEE THE WEN AMONG THE HONEST FOLK ABOUT ME
WHERE MAY HE BE
POOR LAD HIS DIET IS BRIMSTONE NOW AND OVER HOT FOR A DELICATE
TASTE
HE WAS KILLED IN A BRAWL SOMEWHERE ABOUT MIDSUMMER
I SORROW TO HEAR THAT THE WEN WAS A CAPABLE MAN AND BRAVE
THAT WAS HE TRULY
BLACK BESS HIS DELL IS OF US YET BUT ABSENT ON
THE EASTWARD TRAMP A FINE LASS OF NICE WAYS AND ORDERLY CONDUCT NONE
EVER SEEING HER DRUNK ABOVE FOUR DAYS IN THE SEVEN
SHE WAS EVER STRICT I REMEMBER IT WELL A GOODLY WENCH AND WORTHY
ALL COMMENDATION
HER MOTHER WAS MORE FREE AND LESS PARTICULAR A
TROUBLESOME AND UGLY TEMPERED BELDAME BUT FURNISHED WITH A WIT ABOVE
THE COMMON
WE LOST HER THROUGH IT
HER GIFT OF PALMISTRY AND OTHER SORTS OF
FORTUNE TELLING BEGOT FOR HER AT LAST A WITCH'S NAME AND FAME
THE
LAW ROASTED HER TO DEATH AT A SLOW FIRE
IT DID TOUCH ME TO A SORT OF
TENDERNESS TO SEE THE GALLANT WAY SHE MET HER LOT CURSING AND REVILING
ALL THE CROWD THAT GAPED AND GAZED AROUND HER WHILST THE FLAMES LICKED
UPWARD TOWARD HER FACE AND CATCHED HER THIN LOCKS AND CRACKLED ABOUT
HER OLD GRAY HEAD CURSING THEM WHY AN' THOU SHOULD'ST LIVE A THOUSAND
YEARS THOUD'ST NEVER HEAR SO MASTERFUL A CURSING
ALACK HER ART DIED
WITH HER
THERE BE BASE AND WEAKLING IMITATIONS LEFT BUT NO TRUE
BLASPHEMY
THE RUFFLER SIGHED THE LISTENERS SIGHED IN SYMPATHY A GENERAL
DEPRESSION FELL UPON THE COMPANY FOR A MOMENT FOR EVEN HARDENED
OUTCASTS LIKE THESE ARE NOT WHOLLY DEAD TO SENTIMENT BUT ARE ABLE TO
FEEL A FLEETING SENSE OF LOSS AND AFFLICTION AT WIDE INTERVALS AND
UNDER PECULIARLY FAVOURING CIRCUMSTANCES AS IN CASES LIKE TO THIS FOR
INSTANCE WHEN GENIUS AND CULTURE DEPART AND LEAVE NO HEIR
HOWEVER A
DEEP DRINK ALL ROUND SOON RESTORED THE SPIRITS OF THE MOURNERS
HAVE ANY OTHERS OF OUR FRIENDS FARED HARDLY ASKED HOBBS
SOME YES
PARTICULARLY NEW COMERS SUCH AS SMALL HUSBANDMEN TURNED
SHIFTLESS AND HUNGRY UPON THE WORLD BECAUSE THEIR FARMS WERE TAKEN FROM
THEM TO BE CHANGED TO SHEEP RANGES
THEY BEGGED AND WERE WHIPPED AT
THE CART'S TAIL NAKED FROM THE GIRDLE UP TILL THE BLOOD RAN THEN SET
IN THE STOCKS TO BE PELTED THEY BEGGED AGAIN WERE WHIPPED AGAIN AND
DEPRIVED OF AN EAR THEY BEGGED A THIRD TIME POOR DEVILS WHAT ELSE
COULD THEY DO AND WERE BRANDED ON THE CHEEK WITH A RED HOT IRON THEN
SOLD FOR SLAVES THEY RAN AWAY WERE HUNTED DOWN AND HANGED

BEFORE YE

CURSE OF HEAVEN FALL ON THE LAW OF THE LAND THAT HATH COMMANDED IT I
SHALL HANG 1
A RINGING VOICE CAME THROUGH THE MURKY AIR
THOU SHALT NOT AND THIS DAY THE END OF THAT LAW IS COME
ALL TURNED AND SAW THE FANTASTIC FIGURE OF THE LITTLE KING APPROACHING
HURRIEDLY AS IT EMERGED INTO THE LIGHT AND WAS CLEARLY REVEALED A
GENERAL EXPLOSION OF INQUIRIES BROKE OUT
WHO IS IT WHAT IS IT WHO ART THOU MANIKIN
THE BOY STOOD UNCONFUSED IN THE MIDST OF ALL THOSE SURPRISED AND
QUESTIONING EYES AND ANSWERED WITH PRINCELY DIGNITY
I AM EDWARD KING OF ENGLAND
A WILD BURST OF LAUGHTER FOLLOWED PARTLY OF DERISION AND PARTLY OF
DELIGHT IN THE EXCELLENCE OF THE JOKE
THE KING WAS STUNG
HE SAID
SHARPLY
YE MANNERLESS VAGRANTS IS THIS YOUR RECOGNITION OF THE ROYAL BOON I
HAVE PROMISED
HE SAID MORE WITH ANGRY VOICE AND EXCITED GESTURE BUT IT WAS LOST IN
A WHIRLWIND OF LAUGHTER AND MOCKING EXCLAMATIONS
'JOHN HOBBS' MADE
SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO MAKE HIMSELF HEARD ABOVE THE DIN AND AT LAST
SUCCEEDED SAYING
MATES HE IS MY SON A DREAMER A FOOL AND STARK MAD MIND HIM NOT HE
THINKETH HE IS THE KING
I AM THE KING SAID EDWARD TURNING TOWARD HIM AS THOU SHALT KNOW
TO THY COST IN GOOD TIME
THOU HAST CONFESSED A MURDER THOU SHALT
SWING FOR IT
THOU'LT BETRAY ME THOU AN' I GET MY HANDS UPON THEE
TUT TUT SAID THE BURLEY RUFFLER INTERPOSING IN TIME TO SAVE THE
KING AND EMPHASISING THIS SERVICE BY KNOCKING HOBBS DOWN WITH HIS FIST
HAST RESPECT FOR NEITHER KINGS NOR RUFFLERS AN' THOU INSULT MY
PRESENCE SO AGAIN I'LL HANG THEE UP MYSELF THEN HE SAID TO HIS
MAJESTY THOU MUST MAKE NO THREATS AGAINST THY MATES LAD AND THOU
MUST GUARD THY TONGUE FROM SAYING EVIL OF THEM ELSEWHERE
BE KING IF
IT PLEASE THY MAD HUMOUR BUT BE NOT HARMFUL IN IT
SINK THE TITLE THOU
HAST UTTERED 'TIS TREASON WE BE BAD MEN IN SOME FEW TRIFLING WAYS BUT
NONE AMONG US IS SO BASE AS TO BE TRAITOR TO HIS KING WE BE LOVING
AND LOYAL HEARTS IN THAT REGARD
NOTE IF I SPEAK TRUTH
NOW ALL
TOGETHER 'LONG LIVE EDWARD KING OF ENGLAND
LONG LIVE EDWARD KING OF ENGLAND
THE RESPONSE CAME WITH SUCH A THUNDERGUST FROM THE MOTLEY CREW THAT THE
CRAZY BUILDING VIBRATED TO THE SOUND
THE LITTLE KING'S FACE LIGHTED
WITH PLEASURE FOR AN INSTANT AND HE SLIGHTLY INCLINED HIS HEAD AND
SAID WITH GRAVE SIMPLICITY
I THANK YOU MY GOOD PEOPLE
THIS UNEXPECTED RESULT THREW THE COMPANY INTO CONVULSIONS OF MERRIMENT
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE QUIET WAS PRESENTLY COME AGAIN THE RUFFLER SAID
FIRMLY BUT WITH AN ACCENT OF GOOD NATURE
DROP IT BOY 'TIS NOT WISE NOR WELL
HUMOUR THY FANCY IF THOU MUST
BUT CHOOSE SOME OTHER TITLE
A TINKER SHRIEKED OUT A SUGGESTION
FOO FOO THE FIRST KING OF THE MOONCALVES
THE TITLE 'TOOK AT ONCE EVERY THROAT RESPONDED AND A ROARING SHOUT
WENT UP OF
LONG LIVE FOO FOO THE FIRST KING OF THE MOONCALVES FOLLOWED BY
HOOTINGS CAT CALLS AND PEALS OF LAUGHTER
HALE HIM FORTH AND CROWN HIM
ROBE HIM
SCEPTRE HIM
THRONE HIM
THESE AND TWENTY OTHER CRIES BROKE OUT AT ONCE AND ALMOST BEFORE THE
POOR LITTLE VICTIM COULD DRAW A BREATH HE WAS CROWNED WITH A TIN BASIN
ROBED IN A TATTERED BLANKET THRONED UPON A BARREL AND SCEPTRED WITH
THE TINKER'S SOLDERING IRON
THEN ALL FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON THEIR
KNEES ABOUT HIM AND SENT UP A CHORUS OF IRONICAL WAILINGS AND MOCKING
SUPPLICATIONS WHILST THEY SWABBED THEIR EYES WITH THEIR SOILED AND
RAGGED SLEEVES AND APRONS
BE GRACIOUS TO US O SWEET KING
TRAMPLE NOT UPON THY BESEECHING WORMS O NOBLE MAJESTY
PITY THY SLAVES AND COMFORT THEM WITH A ROYAL KICK
CHEER US AND WARM US WITH THY GRACIOUS RAYS O FLAMING SUN OF
SOVEREIGNTY
SANCTIFY THE GROUND WITH THE TOUCH OF THY FOOT THAT WE MAY EAT THE
DIRT AND BE ENNOBLED
DEIGN TO SPIT UPON US O SIRE THAT OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN MAY TELL OF
THY PRINCELY CONDESCENSION AND BE PROUD AND HAPPY FOR EVER
BUT THE HUMOROUS TINKER MADE THE 'HIT' OF THE EVENING AND CARRIED OFF
THE HONOURS
KNEELING HE PRETENDED TO KISS THE KING'S FOOT AND WAS
INDIGNANTLY SPURNED WHEREUPON HE WENT ABOUT BEGGING FOR A RAG TO PASTE
OVER THE PLACE UPON HIS FACE WHICH HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE FOOT SAYING
IT MUST BE PRESERVED FROM CONTACT WITH THE VULGAR AIR AND THAT HE
SHOULD MAKE HIS FORTUNE BY GOING ON THE HIGHWAY AND EXPOSING IT TO
VIEW AT THE RATE OF A HUNDRED SHILLINGS A SIGHT
HE MADE HIMSELF SO
KILLINGLY FUNNY THAT HE WAS THE ENVY AND ADMIRATION OF THE WHOLE MANGY
RABBLE
TEARS OF SHAME AND INDIGNATION STOOD IN THE LITTLE MONARCH'S EYES AND
THE THOUGHT IN HIS HEART WAS HAD I OFFERED THEM A DEEP WRONG THEY
COULD NOT BE MORE CRUEL YET HAVE I PROFFERED NOUGHT BUT TO DO THEM A
KINDNESS AND IT IS THUS THEY USE ME FOR IT
CHAPTER XVIII
THE PRINCE WITH THE TRAMPS
THE TROOP OF VAGABONDS TURNED OUT AT EARLY DAWN AND SET FORWARD ON
THEIR MARCH
THERE WAS A LOWERING SKY OVERHEAD SLOPPY GROUND UNDER
FOOT AND A WINTER CHILL IN THE AIR
ALL GAIETY WAS GONE FROM THE
COMPANY SOME WERE SULLEN AND SILENT SOME WERE IRRITABLE AND PETULANT
NONE WERE GENTLE HUMOURED ALL WERE THIRSTY
THE RUFFLER PUT 'JACK' IN HUGO'S CHARGE WITH SOME BRIEF INSTRUCTIONS
AND COMMANDED JOHN CANTY TO KEEP AWAY FROM HIM AND LET HIM ALONE HE
ALSO WARNED HUGO NOT TO BE TOO ROUGH WITH THE LAD
AFTER A WHILE THE WEATHER GREW MILDER AND THE CLOUDS LIFTED SOMEWHAT
THE TROOP CEASED TO SHIVER AND THEIR SPIRITS BEGAN TO IMPROVE
THEY
GREW MORE AND MORE CHEERFUL AND FINALLY BEGAN TO CHAFF EACH OTHER AND
INSULT PASSENGERS ALONG THE HIGHWAY
THIS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE AWAKING
TO AN APPRECIATION OF LIFE AND ITS JOYS ONCE MORE
THE DREAD IN WHICH
THEIR SORT WAS HELD WAS APPARENT IN THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY GAVE THEM
THE ROAD AND TOOK THEIR RIBALD INSOLENCES MEEKLY WITHOUT VENTURING
TO TALK BACK
THEY SNATCHED LINEN FROM THE HEDGES OCCASIONALLY IN FULL
VIEW OF THE OWNERS WHO MADE NO PROTEST BUT ONLY SEEMED GRATEFUL THAT
THEY DID NOT TAKE THE HEDGES TOO
BY AND BY THEY INVADED A SMALL FARMHOUSE AND MADE THEMSELVES AT HOME
WHILE THE TREMBLING FARMER AND HIS PEOPLE SWEPT THE LARDER CLEAN TO
FURNISH A BREAKFAST FOR THEM
THEY CHUCKED THE HOUSEWIFE AND HER
DAUGHTERS UNDER THE CHIN WHILST RECEIVING THE FOOD FROM THEIR HANDS AND
MADE COARSE JESTS ABOUT THEM ACCOMPANIED WITH INSULTING EPITHETS AND
BURSTS OF HORSE LAUGHTER
THEY THREW BONES AND VEGETABLES AT THE FARMER
AND HIS SONS KEPT THEM DODGING ALL THE TIME AND APPLAUDED UPROARIOUSLY
WHEN A GOOD HIT WAS MADE
THEY ENDED BY BUTTERING THE HEAD OF ONE OF
THE DAUGHTERS WHO RESENTED SOME OF THEIR FAMILIARITIES
WHEN THEY TOOK
THEIR LEAVE THEY THREATENED TO COME BACK AND BURN THE HOUSE OVER THE
HEADS OF THE FAMILY IF ANY REPORT OF THEIR DOINGS GOT TO THE EARS OF THE
AUTHORITIES
ABOUT NOON AFTER A LONG AND WEARY TRAMP THE GANG CAME TO A HALT BEHIND
A HEDGE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A CONSIDERABLE VILLAGE
AN HOUR WAS ALLOWED
FOR REST THEN THE CREW SCATTERED THEMSELVES ABROAD TO ENTER THE VILLAGE
AT DIFFERENT POINTS TO PLY THEIR VARIOUS TRADES 'JACK' WAS SENT WITH
HUGO
THEY WANDERED HITHER AND THITHER FOR SOME TIME HUGO WATCHING
FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO DO A STROKE OF BUSINESS BUT FINDING NONE SO HE
FINALLY SAID
I SEE NOUGHT TO STEAL IT IS A PALTRY PLACE
WHEREFORE WE WILL BEG
WE FORSOOTH FOLLOW THY TRADE IT BEFITS THEE
BUT I WILL NOT
BEG
THOU'LT NOT BEG EXCLAIMED HUGO EYEING THE KING WITH SURPRISE
PRITHEE SINCE WHEN HAST THOU REFORMED
WHAT DOST THOU MEAN
MEAN HAST THOU NOT BEGGED THE STREETS OF LONDON ALL THY LIFE

COME PLAY NOT THY MERRY GAME OF MADMAN SO FAR MATE USE IT FOR THY
AMUSEMENT NOT THY HURT
AN' I TELL HIM THIS HE WILL SCORCH THEE
FINELY FOR IT
SAVE THYSELF THE TROUBLE
I WILL TELL HIM
I LIKE THY SPIRIT I DO IN TRUTH BUT I DO NOT ADMIRE THY JUDGMENT
BONE RACKINGS AND BASTINGS BE PLENTY ENOW IN THIS LIFE WITHOUT GOING
OUT OF ONE'S WAY TO INVITE THEM
BUT A TRUCE TO THESE MATTERS I
BELIEVE YOUR FATHER
I DOUBT NOT HE CAN LIE I DOUBT NOT HE DOTH
LIE UPON OCCASION FOR THE BEST OF US DO THAT BUT THERE IS NO OCCASION
HERE
A WISE MAN DOES NOT WASTE SO GOOD A COMMODITY AS LYING FOR
NOUGHT
BUT COME SITH IT IS THY HUMOUR TO GIVE OVER BEGGING
WHEREWITHAL SHALL WE BUSY OURSELVES WITH ROBBING KITCHENS
THE KING SAID IMPATIENTLY
HAVE DONE WITH THIS FOLLY YOU WEARY ME
HUGO REPLIED WITH TEMPER
NOW HARKEE MATE YOU WILL NOT BEG YOU WILL NOT ROB SO BE IT
BUT I
WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU WILL DO
YOU WILL PLAY DECOY WHILST I BEG
REFUSE AN' YOU THINK YOU MAY VENTURE
THE KING WAS ABOUT TO REPLY CONTEMPTUOUSLY WHEN HUGO SAID
INTERRUPTING
PEACE HERE COMES ONE WITH A KINDLY FACE
NOW WILL I FALL DOWN IN
A FIT
WHEN THE STRANGER RUNS TO ME SET YOU UP A WAIL AND FALL UPON
YOUR KNEES SEEMING TO WEEP THEN CRY OUT AS ALL THE DEVILS OF MISERY
WERE IN YOUR BELLY AND SAY 'OH SIR IT IS MY POOR AFFLICTED BROTHER
AND WE BE FRIENDLESS O' GOD'S NAME CAST THROUGH YOUR MERCIFUL EYES ONE
PITIFUL LOOK UPON A SICK FORSAKEN AND MOST MISERABLE WRETCH BESTOW
ONE LITTLE PENNY OUT OF THY RICHES UPON ONE SMITTEN OF GOD AND READY
TO PERISH AND MIND YOU KEEP YOU ON WAILING AND ABATE NOT TILL WE
BILK HIM OF HIS PENNY ELSE SHALL YOU RUE IT
THEN IMMEDIATELY HUGO BEGAN TO MOAN AND GROAN AND ROLL HIS EYES AND
REEL AND TOTTER ABOUT AND WHEN THE STRANGER WAS CLOSE AT HAND DOWN HE
SPRAWLED BEFORE HIM WITH A SHRIEK AND BEGAN TO WRITHE AND WALLOW IN
THE DIRT IN SEEMING AGONY
O DEAR O DEAR CRIED THE BENEVOLENT STRANGER O POOR SOUL POOR
SOUL HOW HE DOTH SUFFER THERE LET ME HELP THEE UP
O NOBLE SIR FORBEAR AND GOD LOVE YOU FOR A PRINCELY GENTLEMAN BUT IT
GIVETH ME CRUEL PAIN TO TOUCH ME WHEN I AM TAKEN SO
MY BROTHER THERE
WILL TELL YOUR WORSHIP HOW I AM RACKED WITH ANGUISH WHEN THESE FITS BE
UPON ME
A PENNY DEAR SIR A PENNY TO BUY A LITTLE FOOD THEN LEAVE
ME TO MY SORROWS
A PENNY THOU SHALT HAVE THREE THOU HAPLESS CREATURE AND HE FUMBLED
IN HIS POCKET WITH NERVOUS HASTE AND GOT THEM OUT
THERE POOR LAD
TAKE THEM AND MOST WELCOME
NOW COME HITHER MY BOY AND HELP ME CARRY
THY STRICKEN BROTHER TO YON HOUSE WHERE
I AM NOT HIS BROTHER SAID THE KING INTERRUPTING
WHAT NOT HIS BROTHER
OH HEAR HIM GROANED HUGO THEN PRIVATELY GROUND HIS TEETH
HE
DENIES HIS OWN BROTHER AND HE WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE
BOY THOU ART INDEED HARD OF HEART IF THIS IS THY BROTHER
FOR
SHAME AND HE SCARCE ABLE TO MOVE HAND OR FOOT
IF HE IS NOT THY
BROTHER WHO IS HE THEN
A BEGGAR AND A THIEF HE HAS GOT YOUR MONEY AND HAS PICKED YOUR POCKET
LIKEWISE
AN' THOU WOULD'ST DO A HEALING MIRACLE LAY THY STAFF OVER
HIS SHOULDERS AND TRUST PROVIDENCE FOR THE REST
BUT HUGO DID NOT TARRY FOR THE MIRACLE
IN A MOMENT HE WAS UP AND OFF
LIKE THE WIND THE GENTLEMAN FOLLOWING AFTER AND RAISING THE HUE AND CRY
LUSTILY AS HE WENT
THE KING BREATHING DEEP GRATITUDE TO HEAVEN FOR
HIS OWN RELEASE FLED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND DID NOT SLACKEN
HIS PACE UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF HARM'S REACH
HE TOOK THE FIRST ROAD THAT
OFFERED AND SOON PUT THE VILLAGE BEHIND HIM
HE HURRIED ALONG AS
BRISKLY AS HE COULD DURING SEVERAL HOURS KEEPING A NERVOUS WATCH OVER
HIS SHOULDER FOR PURSUIT BUT HIS FEARS LEFT HIM AT LAST AND A GRATEFUL
SENSE OF SECURITY TOOK THEIR PLACE
HE RECOGNISED NOW THAT HE WAS
HUNGRY AND ALSO VERY TIRED
SO HE HALTED AT A FARMHOUSE BUT WHEN
HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK HE WAS CUT SHORT AND DRIVEN RUDELY AWAY
HIS
CLOTHES WERE AGAINST HIM
HE WANDERED ON WOUNDED AND INDIGNANT AND WAS RESOLVED TO PUT HIMSELF
IN THE WAY OF LIKE TREATMENT NO MORE
BUT HUNGER IS PRIDE'S MASTER SO
AS THE EVENING DREW NEAR HE MADE AN ATTEMPT AT ANOTHER FARMHOUSE BUT
HERE HE FARED WORSE THAN BEFORE FOR HE WAS CALLED HARD NAMES AND WAS
PROMISED ARREST AS A VAGRANT EXCEPT HE MOVED ON PROMPTLY
THE NIGHT CAME ON CHILLY AND OVERCAST AND STILL THE FOOTSORE MONARCH
LABOURED SLOWLY ON
HE WAS OBLIGED TO KEEP MOVING FOR EVERY TIME HE
SAT DOWN TO REST HE WAS SOON PENETRATED TO THE BONE WITH THE COLD
ALL
HIS SENSATIONS AND EXPERIENCES AS HE MOVED THROUGH THE SOLEMN GLOOM
AND THE EMPTY VASTNESS OF THE NIGHT WERE NEW AND STRANGE TO HIM
AT
INTERVALS HE HEARD VOICES APPROACH PASS BY AND FADE INTO SILENCE AND
AS HE SAW NOTHING MORE OF THE BODIES THEY BELONGED TO THAN A SORT OF
FORMLESS DRIFTING BLUR THERE WAS SOMETHING SPECTRAL AND UNCANNY ABOUT
IT ALL THAT MADE HIM SHUDDER
OCCASIONALLY HE CAUGHT THE TWINKLE OF A
LIGHT ALWAYS FAR AWAY APPARENTLY ALMOST IN ANOTHER WORLD IF HE HEARD
THE TINKLE OF A SHEEP'S BELL IT WAS VAGUE DISTANT INDISTINCT
THE MUFFLED LOWING OF THE HERDS FLOATED TO HIM ON THE NIGHT WIND IN
VANISHING CADENCES A MOURNFUL SOUND NOW AND THEN CAME THE COMPLAINING
HOWL OF A DOG OVER VIEWLESS EXPANSES OF FIELD AND FOREST ALL SOUNDS
WERE REMOTE THEY MADE THE LITTLE KING FEEL THAT ALL LIFE AND ACTIVITY
WERE FAR REMOVED FROM HIM AND THAT HE STOOD SOLITARY COMPANIONLESS IN
THE CENTRE OF A MEASURELESS SOLITUDE
HE STUMBLED ALONG THROUGH THE GRUESOME FASCINATIONS OF THIS NEW
EXPERIENCE STARTLED OCCASIONALLY BY THE SOFT RUSTLING OF THE DRY LEAVES
OVERHEAD SO LIKE HUMAN WHISPERS THEY SEEMED TO SOUND AND BY AND BY HE
CAME SUDDENLY UPON THE FRECKLED LIGHT OF A TIN LANTERN NEAR AT HAND
HE
STEPPED BACK INTO THE SHADOWS AND WAITED
THE LANTERN STOOD BY THE
OPEN DOOR OF A BARN
THE KING WAITED SOME TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND
AND NOBODY STIRRING
HE GOT SO COLD STANDING STILL AND THE HOSPITABLE
BARN LOOKED SO ENTICING THAT AT LAST HE RESOLVED TO RISK EVERYTHING AND
ENTER
HE STARTED SWIFTLY AND STEALTHILY AND JUST AS HE WAS CROSSING
THE THRESHOLD HE HEARD VOICES BEHIND HIM
HE DARTED BEHIND A CASK
WITHIN THE BARN AND STOOPED DOWN
TWO FARM LABOURERS CAME IN BRINGING
THE LANTERN WITH THEM AND FELL TO WORK TALKING MEANWHILE
WHILST THEY
MOVED ABOUT WITH THE LIGHT THE KING MADE GOOD USE OF HIS EYES AND TOOK
THE BEARINGS OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A GOOD SIZED STALL AT THE FURTHER END
OF THE PLACE PURPOSING TO GROPE HIS WAY TO IT WHEN HE SHOULD BE LEFT TO
HIMSELF
HE ALSO NOTED THE POSITION OF A PILE OF HORSE BLANKETS MIDWAY
OF THE ROUTE WITH THE INTENT TO LEVY UPON THEM FOR THE SERVICE OF THE
CROWN OF ENGLAND FOR ONE NIGHT
BY AND BY THE MEN FINISHED AND WENT AWAY FASTENING THE DOOR BEHIND
THEM AND TAKING THE LANTERN WITH THEM
THE SHIVERING KING MADE FOR THE
BLANKETS WITH AS GOOD SPEED AS THE DARKNESS WOULD ALLOW GATHERED THEM
UP AND THEN GROPED HIS WAY SAFELY TO THE STALL
OF TWO OF THE BLANKETS
HE MADE A BED THEN COVERED HIMSELF WITH THE REMAINING TWO
HE WAS A
GLAD MONARCH NOW THOUGH THE BLANKETS WERE OLD AND THIN AND NOT QUITE
WARM ENOUGH AND BESIDES GAVE OUT A PUNGENT HORSEY ODOUR THAT WAS ALMOST
SUFFOCATINGLY POWERFUL
ALTHOUGH THE KING WAS HUNGRY AND CHILLY HE WAS ALSO SO TIRED AND SO
DROWSY THAT THESE LATTER INFLUENCES SOON BEGAN TO GET THE ADVANTAGE
OF THE FORMER AND HE PRESENTLY DOZED OFF INTO A STATE OF
SEMI CONSCIOUSNESS
THEN JUST AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF LOSING HIMSELF
WHOLLY HE DISTINCTLY FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIM HE WAS BROAD AWAKE IN
A MOMENT AND GASPING FOR BREATH
THE COLD HORROR OF THAT MYSTERIOUS
TOUCH IN THE DARK ALMOST MADE HIS HEART STAND STILL
HE LAY MOTIONLESS
AND LISTENED SCARCELY BREATHING
BUT NOTHING STIRRED AND THERE WAS
NO SOUND
HE CONTINUED TO LISTEN AND WAIT DURING WHAT SEEMED A LONG
TIME BUT STILL NOTHING STIRRED AND THERE WAS NO SOUND
SO HE BEGAN
TO DROP INTO A DROWSE ONCE MORE AT LAST AND ALL AT ONCE HE FELT THAT
MYSTERIOUS TOUCH AGAIN IT WAS A GRISLY THING THIS LIGHT TOUCH FROM
THIS NOISELESS AND INVISIBLE PRESENCE IT MADE THE BOY SICK WITH GHOSTLY
FEARS
WHAT SHOULD HE DO THAT WAS THE QUESTION BUT HE DID NOT KNOW
HOW TO ANSWER IT
SHOULD HE LEAVE THESE REASONABLY COMFORTABLE QUARTERS
AND FLY FROM THIS INSCRUTABLE HORROR BUT FLY WHITHER HE COULD
NOT GET OUT OF THE BARN AND THE IDEA OF SCURRYING BLINDLY HITHER AND
THITHER IN THE DARK WITHIN THE CAPTIVITY OF THE FOUR WALLS WITH THIS
PHANTOM GLIDING AFTER HIM AND VISITING HIM WITH THAT SOFT HIDEOUS TOUCH
UPON CHEEK OR SHOULDER AT EVERY TURN WAS INTOLERABLE
BUT TO STAY
WHERE HE WAS AND ENDURE THIS LIVING DEATH ALL NIGHT WAS THAT BETTER
NO
WHAT THEN WAS THERE LEFT TO DO AH THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE
HE KNEW IT WELL HE MUST PUT OUT HIS HAND AND FIND THAT THING
IT WAS EASY TO THINK THIS BUT IT WAS HARD TO BRACE HIMSELF UP TO TRY
IT
THREE TIMES HE STRETCHED HIS HAND A LITTLE WAY OUT INTO THE DARK
GINGERLY AND SNATCHED IT SUDDENLY BACK WITH A GASP NOT BECAUSE IT
HAD ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING BUT BECAUSE HE HAD FELT SO SURE IT WAS JUST
GOING TO
BUT THE FOURTH TIME HE GROPED A LITTLE FURTHER AND HIS
HAND LIGHTLY SWEPT AGAINST SOMETHING SOFT AND WARM
THIS PETRIFIED HIM
NEARLY WITH FRIGHT HIS MIND WAS IN SUCH A STATE THAT HE COULD IMAGINE
THE THING TO BE NOTHING ELSE THAN A CORPSE NEWLY DEAD AND STILL WARM
HE THOUGHT HE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN TOUCH IT AGAIN
BUT HE THOUGHT THIS
FALSE THOUGHT BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW THE IMMORTAL STRENGTH OF
HUMAN CURIOSITY
IN NO LONG TIME HIS HAND WAS TREMBLINGLY GROPING
AGAIN AGAINST HIS JUDGMENT AND WITHOUT HIS CONSENT BUT GROPING
PERSISTENTLY ON JUST THE SAME
IT ENCOUNTERED A BUNCH OF LONG HAIR HE
SHUDDERED BUT FOLLOWED UP THE HAIR AND FOUND WHAT SEEMED TO BE A WARM
ROPE FOLLOWED UP THE ROPE AND FOUND AN INNOCENT CALF FOR THE ROPE WAS
NOT A ROPE AT ALL BUT THE CALF'S TAIL
THE KING WAS CORDIALLY ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR HAVING GOTTEN ALL THAT
FRIGHT AND MISERY OUT OF SO PALTRY A MATTER AS A SLUMBERING CALF BUT HE
NEED NOT HAVE FELT SO ABOUT IT FOR IT WAS NOT THE CALF THAT FRIGHTENED
HIM BUT A DREADFUL NON EXISTENT SOMETHING WHICH THE CALF STOOD FOR AND
ANY OTHER BOY IN THOSE OLD SUPERSTITIOUS TIMES WOULD HAVE ACTED AND
SUFFERED JUST AS HE HAD DONE
THE KING WAS NOT ONLY DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT THE CREATURE WAS ONLY A
CALF BUT DELIGHTED TO HAVE THE CALF'S COMPANY FOR HE HAD BEEN FEELING
SO LONESOME AND FRIENDLESS THAT THE COMPANY AND COMRADESHIP OF EVEN
THIS HUMBLE ANIMAL WERE WELCOME
AND HE HAD BEEN SO BUFFETED SO RUDELY
ENTREATED BY HIS OWN KIND THAT IT WAS A REAL COMFORT TO HIM TO FEEL
THAT HE WAS AT LAST IN THE SOCIETY OF A FELLOW CREATURE THAT HAD AT
LEAST A SOFT HEART AND A GENTLE SPIRIT WHATEVER LOFTIER ATTRIBUTES
MIGHT BE LACKING
SO HE RESOLVED TO WAIVE RANK AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH
THE CALF
WHILE STROKING ITS SLEEK WARM BACK FOR IT LAY NEAR HIM AND WITHIN EASY
REACH IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THIS CALF MIGHT BE UTILISED IN MORE WAYS
THAN ONE
WHEREUPON HE RE ARRANGED HIS BED SPREADING IT DOWN CLOSE TO
THE CALF THEN HE CUDDLED HIMSELF UP TO THE CALF'S BACK DREW THE COVERS
UP OVER HIMSELF AND HIS FRIEND AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO WAS AS WARM AND
COMFORTABLE AS HE HAD EVER BEEN IN THE DOWNY COUCHES OF THE REGAL PALACE
OF WESTMINSTER
PLEASANT THOUGHTS CAME AT ONCE LIFE TOOK ON A CHEERFULLER SEEMING
HE
WAS FREE OF THE BONDS OF SERVITUDE AND CRIME FREE OF THE COMPANIONSHIP
OF BASE AND BRUTAL OUTLAWS HE WAS WARM HE WAS SHELTERED IN A WORD HE
WAS HAPPY
THE NIGHT WIND WAS RISING IT SWEPT BY IN FITFUL GUSTS
THAT MADE THE OLD BARN QUAKE AND RATTLE THEN ITS FORCES DIED DOWN
AT INTERVALS AND WENT MOANING AND WAILING AROUND CORNERS AND
PROJECTIONS BUT IT WAS ALL MUSIC TO THE KING NOW THAT HE WAS SNUG AND
COMFORTABLE LET IT BLOW AND RAGE LET IT BATTER AND BANG LET IT MOAN
AND WAIL HE MINDED IT NOT HE ONLY ENJOYED IT
HE MERELY SNUGGLED
THE CLOSER TO HIS FRIEND IN A LUXURY OF WARM CONTENTMENT AND DRIFTED
BLISSFULLY OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS INTO A DEEP AND DREAMLESS SLEEP THAT
WAS FULL OF SERENITY AND PEACE
THE DISTANT DOGS HOWLED THE MELANCHOLY
KINE COMPLAINED AND THE WINDS WENT ON RAGING WHILST FURIOUS SHEETS
OF RAIN DROVE ALONG THE ROOF BUT THE MAJESTY OF ENGLAND SLEPT ON
UNDISTURBED AND THE CALF DID THE SAME IT BEING A SIMPLE CREATURE AND
NOT EASILY TROUBLED BY STORMS OR EMBARRASSED BY SLEEPING WITH A KING
CHAPTER XIX
THE PRINCE WITH THE PEASANTS
WHEN THE KING AWOKE IN THE EARLY MORNING HE FOUND THAT A WET BUT
THOUGHTFUL RAT HAD CREPT INTO THE PLACE DURING THE NIGHT AND MADE A COSY
BED FOR ITSELF IN HIS BOSOM
BEING DISTURBED NOW IT SCAMPERED AWAY
THE BOY SMILED AND SAID POOR FOOL WHY SO FEARFUL I AM AS FORLORN
AS THOU
'TWOULD BE A SHAM IN ME TO HURT THE HELPLESS WHO AM MYSELF SO
HELPLESS
MOREOVER I OWE YOU THANKS FOR A GOOD OMEN FOR WHEN A KING
HAS FALLEN SO LOW THAT THE VERY RATS DO MAKE A BED OF HIM IT SURELY
MEANETH THAT HIS FORTUNES BE UPON THE TURN SINCE IT IS PLAIN HE CAN NO
LOWER GO
HE GOT UP AND STEPPED OUT OF THE STALL AND JUST THEN HE HEARD THE SOUND
OF CHILDREN'S VOICES
THE BARN DOOR OPENED AND A COUPLE OF LITTLE GIRLS
CAME IN
AS SOON AS THEY SAW HIM THEIR TALKING AND LAUGHING CEASED AND
THEY STOPPED AND STOOD STILL GAZING AT HIM WITH STRONG CURIOSITY THEY
PRESENTLY BEGAN TO WHISPER TOGETHER THEN THEY APPROACHED NEARER AND
STOPPED AGAIN TO GAZE AND WHISPER
BY AND BY THEY GATHERED COURAGE AND
BEGAN TO DISCUSS HIM ALOUD
ONE SAID
HE HATH A COMELY FACE
THE OTHER ADDED
AND PRETTY HAIR
BUT IS ILL CLOTHED ENOW
AND HOW STARVED HE LOOKETH
THEY CAME STILL NEARER SIDLING SHYLY AROUND AND ABOUT HIM EXAMINING
HIM MINUTELY FROM ALL POINTS AS IF HE WERE SOME STRANGE NEW KIND OF
ANIMAL BUT WARILY AND WATCHFULLY THE WHILE AS IF THEY HALF FEARED HE
MIGHT BE A SORT OF ANIMAL THAT WOULD BITE UPON OCCASION
FINALLY THEY
HALTED BEFORE HIM HOLDING EACH OTHER'S HANDS FOR PROTECTION AND TOOK A
GOOD SATISFYING STARE WITH THEIR INNOCENT EYES THEN ONE OF THEM PLUCKED
UP ALL HER COURAGE AND INQUIRED WITH HONEST DIRECTNESS
WHO ART THOU BOY
I AM THE KING WAS THE GRAVE ANSWER
THE CHILDREN GAVE A LITTLE START AND THEIR EYES SPREAD THEMSELVES WIDE
OPEN AND REMAINED SO DURING A SPEECHLESS HALF MINUTE
THEN CURIOSITY
BROKE THE SILENCE
THE KING WHAT KING
THE KING OF ENGLAND
THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT EACH OTHER THEN AT HIM THEN AT EACH OTHER
AGAIN WONDERINGLY PERPLEXEDLY THEN ONE SAID
DIDST HEAR HIM MARGERY HE SAID HE IS THE KING
CAN THAT BE TRUE
HOW CAN IT BE ELSE BUT TRUE PRISSY WOULD HE SAY A LIE FOR LOOK
YOU PRISSY AN' IT WERE NOT TRUE IT WOULD BE A LIE
IT SURELY WOULD
BE
NOW THINK ON'T
FOR ALL THINGS THAT BE NOT TRUE BE LIES THOU
CANST MAKE NOUGHT ELSE OUT OF IT
IT WAS A GOOD TIGHT ARGUMENT WITHOUT A LEAK IN IT ANYWHERE AND IT LEFT
PRISSY'S HALF DOUBTS NOT A LEG TO STAND ON
SHE CONSIDERED A MOMENT
THEN PUT THE KING UPON HIS HONOUR WITH THE SIMPLE REMARK
IF THOU ART TRULY THE KING THEN I BELIEVE THEE
I AM TRULY THE KING
THIS SETTLED THE MATTER
HIS MAJESTY'S ROYALTY WAS ACCEPTED WITHOUT
FURTHER QUESTION OR DISCUSSION AND THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS BEGAN AT ONCE
TO INQUIRE INTO HOW HE CAME TO BE WHERE HE WAS AND HOW HE CAME TO BE SO
UNROYALLY CLAD AND WHITHER HE WAS BOUND AND ALL ABOUT HIS AFFAIRS
IT
WAS A MIGHTY RELIEF TO HIM TO POUR OUT HIS TROUBLES WHERE THEY WOULD NOT
BE SCOFFED AT OR DOUBTED SO HE TOLD HIS TALE WITH FEELING FORGETTING
EVEN HIS HUNGER FOR THE TIME AND IT WAS RECEIVED WITH THE DEEPEST AND
TENDEREST SYMPATHY BY THE GENTLE LITTLE MAIDS
BUT WHEN HE GOT DOWN
TO HIS LATEST EXPERIENCES AND THEY LEARNED HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN WITHOUT
FOOD THEY CUT HIM SHORT AND HURRIED HIM AWAY TO THE FARMHOUSE TO FIND A
BREAKFAST FOR HIM
THE KING WAS CHEERFUL AND HAPPY NOW AND SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN I
AM COME TO MINE OWN AGAIN I WILL ALWAYS HONOUR LITTLE CHILDREN
REMEMBERING HOW THAT THESE TRUSTED ME AND BELIEVED IN ME IN MY TIME
OF TROUBLE WHILST THEY THAT WERE OLDER AND THOUGHT THEMSELVES WISER
MOCKED AT ME AND HELD ME FOR A LIAR
THE CHILDREN'S MOTHER RECEIVED THE KING KINDLY AND WAS FULL OF PITY
FOR HIS FORLORN CONDITION AND APPARENTLY CRAZED INTELLECT TOUCHED HER
WOMANLY HEART
SHE WAS A WIDOW AND RATHER POOR CONSEQUENTLY SHE HAD
SEEN TROUBLE ENOUGH TO ENABLE HER TO FEEL FOR THE UNFORTUNATE
SHE
IMAGINED THAT THE DEMENTED BOY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM HIS FRIENDS OR
KEEPERS SO SHE TRIED TO FIND OUT WHENCE HE HAD COME IN ORDER THAT
SHE MIGHT TAKE MEASURES TO RETURN HIM BUT ALL HER REFERENCES TO
NEIGHBOURING TOWNS AND VILLAGES AND ALL HER INQUIRIES IN THE SAME LINE
WENT FOR NOTHING THE BOY'S FACE AND HIS ANSWERS TOO SHOWED THAT THE
THINGS SHE WAS TALKING OF WERE NOT FAMILIAR TO HIM
HE SPOKE EARNESTLY
AND SIMPLY ABOUT COURT MATTERS AND BROKE DOWN MORE THAN ONCE WHEN
SPEAKING OF THE LATE KING 'HIS FATHER' BUT WHENEVER THE CONVERSATION
CHANGED TO BASER TOPICS HE LOST INTEREST AND BECAME SILENT
THE WOMAN WAS MIGHTILY PUZZLED BUT SHE DID NOT GIVE UP
AS SHE
PROCEEDED WITH HER COOKING SHE SET HERSELF TO CONTRIVING DEVICES TO
SURPRISE THE BOY INTO BETRAYING HIS REAL SECRET
SHE TALKED ABOUT
CATTLE HE SHOWED NO CONCERN THEN ABOUT SHEEP THE SAME RESULT SO
HER GUESS THAT HE HAD BEEN A SHEPHERD BOY WAS AN ERROR SHE TALKED ABOUT
MILLS AND ABOUT WEAVERS TINKERS SMITHS TRADES AND TRADESMEN OF ALL
SORTS AND ABOUT BEDLAM AND JAILS AND CHARITABLE RETREATS BUT NO
MATTER SHE WAS BAFFLED AT ALL POINTS
NOT ALTOGETHER EITHER FOR SHE
ARGUED THAT SHE HAD NARROWED THE THING DOWN TO DOMESTIC SERVICE
YES
SHE WAS SURE SHE WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK NOW HE MUST HAVE BEEN A HOUSE
SERVANT
SO SHE LED UP TO THAT
BUT THE RESULT WAS DISCOURAGING
THE
SUBJECT OF SWEEPING APPEARED TO WEARY HIM FIRE BUILDING FAILED TO STIR
HIM SCRUBBING AND SCOURING AWOKE NO ENTHUSIASM
THE GOODWIFE TOUCHED
WITH A PERISHING HOPE AND RATHER AS A MATTER OF FORM UPON THE SUBJECT
OF COOKING
TO HER SURPRISE AND HER VAST DELIGHT THE KING'S FACE
LIGHTED AT ONCE AH SHE HAD HUNTED HIM DOWN AT LAST SHE THOUGHT AND
SHE WAS RIGHT PROUD TOO OF THE DEVIOUS SHREWDNESS AND TACT WHICH HAD
ACCOMPLISHED IT
HER TIRED TONGUE GOT A CHANCE TO REST NOW FOR THE KING'S INSPIRED
BY GNAWING HUNGER AND THE FRAGRANT SMELLS THAT CAME FROM THE SPUTTERING
POTS AND PANS TURNED ITSELF LOOSE AND DELIVERED ITSELF UP TO SUCH AN
ELOQUENT DISSERTATION UPON CERTAIN TOOTHSOME DISHES THAT WITHIN THREE
MINUTES THE WOMAN SAID TO HERSELF OF A TRUTH I WAS RIGHT HE HATH
HOLPEN IN A KITCHEN THEN HE BROADENED HIS BILL OF FARE AND DISCUSSED
IT WITH SUCH APPRECIATION AND ANIMATION THAT THE GOODWIFE SAID TO
HERSELF GOOD LACK HOW CAN HE KNOW SO MANY DISHES AND SO FINE ONES
WITHAL FOR THESE BELONG ONLY UPON THE TABLES OF THE RICH AND GREAT
AH NOW I SEE RAGGED OUTCAST AS HE IS HE MUST HAVE SERVED IN THE
PALACE BEFORE HIS REASON WENT ASTRAY YES HE MUST HAVE HELPED IN THE
VERY KITCHEN OF THE KING HIMSELF I WILL TEST HIM
FULL OF EAGERNESS TO PROVE HER SAGACITY SHE TOLD THE KING TO MIND THE
COOKING A MOMENT HINTING THAT HE MIGHT MANUFACTURE AND ADD A DISH OR
TWO IF HE CHOSE THEN SHE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND GAVE HER CHILDREN A
SIGN TO FOLLOW AFTER
THE KING MUTTERED
ANOTHER ENGLISH KING HAD A COMMISSION LIKE TO THIS IN A BYGONE
TIME IT IS NOTHING AGAINST MY DIGNITY TO UNDERTAKE AN OFFICE WHICH THE
GREAT ALFRED STOOPED TO ASSUME
BUT I WILL TRY TO BETTER SERVE MY TRUST
THAN HE FOR HE LET THE CAKES BURN
THE INTENT WAS GOOD BUT THE PERFORMANCE WAS NOT ANSWERABLE TO IT FOR
THIS KING LIKE THE OTHER ONE SOON FELL INTO DEEP THINKINGS CONCERNING
HIS VAST AFFAIRS AND THE SAME CALAMITY RESULTED THE COOKERY GOT
BURNED
THE WOMAN RETURNED IN TIME TO SAVE THE BREAKFAST FROM ENTIRE
DESTRUCTION AND SHE PROMPTLY BROUGHT THE KING OUT OF HIS DREAMS WITH A
BRISK AND CORDIAL TONGUE LASHING
THEN SEEING HOW TROUBLED HE WAS
OVER HIS VIOLATED TRUST SHE SOFTENED AT ONCE AND WAS ALL GOODNESS AND
GENTLENESS TOWARD HIM
THE BOY MADE A HEARTY AND SATISFYING MEAL AND WAS GREATLY REFRESHED AND
GLADDENED BY IT
IT WAS A MEAL WHICH WAS DISTINGUISHED BY THIS CURIOUS
FEATURE THAT RANK WAS WAIVED ON BOTH SIDES YET NEITHER RECIPIENT
OF THE FAVOUR WAS AWARE THAT IT HAD BEEN EXTENDED
THE GOODWIFE HAD
INTENDED TO FEED THIS YOUNG TRAMP WITH BROKEN VICTUALS IN A CORNER
LIKE ANY OTHER TRAMP OR LIKE A DOG BUT SHE WAS SO REMORSEFUL FOR THE
SCOLDING SHE HAD GIVEN HIM THAT SHE DID WHAT SHE COULD TO ATONE FOR IT
BY ALLOWING HIM TO SIT AT THE FAMILY TABLE AND EAT WITH HIS BETTERS ON
OSTENSIBLE TERMS OF EQUALITY WITH THEM AND THE KING ON HIS SIDE WAS
SO REMORSEFUL FOR HAVING BROKEN HIS TRUST AFTER THE FAMILY HAD BEEN SO
KIND TO HIM THAT HE FORCED HIMSELF TO ATONE FOR IT BY HUMBLING HIMSELF
TO THE FAMILY LEVEL INSTEAD OF REQUIRING THE WOMAN AND HER CHILDREN TO
STAND AND WAIT UPON HIM WHILE HE OCCUPIED THEIR TABLE IN THE SOLITARY
STATE DUE TO HIS BIRTH AND DIGNITY
IT DOES US ALL GOOD TO UNBEND
SOMETIMES
THIS GOOD WOMAN WAS MADE HAPPY ALL THE DAY LONG BY THE
APPLAUSES WHICH SHE GOT OUT OF HERSELF FOR HER MAGNANIMOUS CONDESCENSION
TO A TRAMP AND THE KING WAS JUST AS SELF COMPLACENT OVER HIS GRACIOUS
HUMILITY TOWARD A HUMBLE PEASANT WOMAN
WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER THE HOUSEWIFE TOLD THE KING TO WASH UP THE
DISHES
THIS COMMAND WAS A STAGGERER FOR A MOMENT AND THE KING CAME
NEAR REBELLING BUT THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF ALFRED THE GREAT WATCHED
THE CAKES DOUBTLESS HE WOULD HAVE WASHED THE DISHES TOO THEREFORE WILL
I ESSAY IT
HE MADE A SUFFICIENTLY POOR JOB OF IT AND TO HIS SURPRISE TOO FOR THE
CLEANING OF WOODEN SPOONS AND TRENCHERS HAD SEEMED AN EASY THING TO DO
IT WAS A TEDIOUS AND TROUBLESOME PIECE OF WORK BUT HE FINISHED IT
AT LAST
HE WAS BECOMING IMPATIENT TO GET AWAY ON HIS JOURNEY NOW
HOWEVER HE WAS NOT TO LOSE THIS THRIFTY DAME'S SOCIETY SO EASILY
SHE
FURNISHED HIM SOME LITTLE ODDS AND ENDS OF EMPLOYMENT WHICH HE GOT
THROUGH WITH AFTER A FAIR FASHION AND WITH SOME CREDIT
THEN SHE SET
HIM AND THE LITTLE GIRLS TO PARING SOME WINTER APPLES BUT HE WAS SO
AWKWARD AT THIS SERVICE THAT SHE RETIRED HIM FROM IT AND GAVE HIM A
BUTCHER KNIFE TO GRIND
AFTERWARDS SHE KEPT HIM CARDING WOOL UNTIL HE BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD LAID
THE GOOD KING ALFRED ABOUT FAR ENOUGH IN THE SHADE FOR THE PRESENT IN
THE MATTER OF SHOWY MENIAL HEROISMS THAT WOULD READ PICTURESQUELY IN
STORY BOOKS AND HISTORIES AND SO HE WAS HALF MINDED TO RESIGN
AND
WHEN JUST AFTER THE NOONDAY DINNER THE GOODWIFE GAVE HIM A BASKET
OF KITTENS TO DROWN HE DID RESIGN
AT LEAST HE WAS JUST GOING TO
RESIGN FOR HE FELT THAT HE MUST DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE AND IT
SEEMED TO HIM THAT TO DRAW IT AT KITTEN DROWNING WAS ABOUT THE RIGHT
THING WHEN THERE WAS AN INTERRUPTION
THE INTERRUPTION WAS JOHN
CANTY WITH A PEDDLER'S PACK ON HIS BACK AND HUGO
THE KING DISCOVERED THESE RASCALS APPROACHING THE FRONT GATE BEFORE THEY
HAD HAD A CHANCE TO SEE HIM SO HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT DRAWING THE LINE
BUT TOOK UP HIS BASKET OF KITTENS AND STEPPED QUIETLY OUT THE BACK WAY
WITHOUT A WORD
HE LEFT THE CREATURES IN AN OUT HOUSE AND HURRIED ON
INTO A NARROW LANE AT THE REAR
CHAPTER XX
THE PRINCE AND THE HERMIT
THE HIGH HEDGE HID HIM FROM THE HOUSE NOW AND SO UNDER THE IMPULSE OF
A DEADLY FRIGHT HE LET OUT ALL HIS FORCES AND SPED TOWARD A WOOD IN THE
DISTANCE
HE NEVER LOOKED BACK UNTIL HE HAD ALMOST GAINED THE SHELTER
OF THE FOREST THEN HE TURNED AND DESCRIED TWO FIGURES IN THE DISTANCE
THAT WAS SUFFICIENT HE DID NOT WAIT TO SCAN THEM CRITICALLY BUT
HURRIED ON AND NEVER ABATED HIS PACE TILL HE WAS FAR WITHIN THE
TWILIGHT DEPTHS OF THE WOOD
THEN HE STOPPED BEING PERSUADED THAT HE
WAS NOW TOLERABLY SAFE
HE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT THE STILLNESS WAS
PROFOUND AND SOLEMN AWFUL EVEN AND DEPRESSING TO THE SPIRITS
AT
WIDE INTERVALS HIS STRAINING EAR DID DETECT SOUNDS BUT THEY WERE SO
REMOTE AND HOLLOW AND MYSTERIOUS THAT THEY SEEMED NOT TO BE REAL
SOUNDS BUT ONLY THE MOANING AND COMPLAINING GHOSTS OF DEPARTED
ONES
SO THE SOUNDS WERE YET MORE DREARY THAN THE SILENCE WHICH THEY
INTERRUPTED
IT WAS HIS PURPOSE IN THE BEGINNING TO STAY WHERE HE WAS THE REST OF
THE DAY BUT A CHILL SOON INVADED HIS PERSPIRING BODY AND HE WAS AT
LAST OBLIGED TO RESUME MOVEMENT IN ORDER TO GET WARM
HE STRUCK STRAIGHT
THROUGH THE FOREST HOPING TO PIERCE TO A ROAD PRESENTLY BUT HE WAS
DISAPPOINTED IN THIS
HE TRAVELLED ON AND ON BUT THE FARTHER HE WENT
THE DENSER THE WOOD BECAME APPARENTLY
THE GLOOM BEGAN TO THICKEN
BY AND BY AND THE KING REALISED THAT THE NIGHT WAS COMING ON
IT MADE
HIM SHUDDER TO THINK OF SPENDING IT IN SUCH AN UNCANNY PLACE SO HE
TRIED TO HURRY FASTER BUT HE ONLY MADE THE LESS SPEED FOR HE COULD
NOT NOW SEE WELL ENOUGH TO CHOOSE HIS STEPS JUDICIOUSLY CONSEQUENTLY HE
KEPT TRIPPING OVER ROOTS AND TANGLING HIMSELF IN VINES AND BRIERS
AND HOW GLAD HE WAS WHEN AT LAST HE CAUGHT THE GLIMMER OF A LIGHT HE
APPROACHED IT WARILY STOPPING OFTEN TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND LISTEN
IT
CAME FROM AN UNGLAZED WINDOW OPENING IN A SHABBY LITTLE HUT
HE HEARD
A VOICE NOW AND FELT A DISPOSITION TO RUN AND HIDE BUT HE CHANGED HIS
MIND AT ONCE FOR THIS VOICE WAS PRAYING EVIDENTLY
HE GLIDED TO THE
ONE WINDOW OF THE HUT RAISED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE AND STOLE A GLANCE
WITHIN
THE ROOM WAS SMALL ITS FLOOR WAS THE NATURAL EARTH BEATEN
HARD BY USE IN A CORNER WAS A BED OF RUSHES AND A RAGGED BLANKET OR
TWO NEAR IT WAS A PAIL A CUP A BASIN AND TWO OR THREE POTS AND PANS
THERE WAS A SHORT BENCH AND A THREE LEGGED STOOL ON THE HEARTH THE
REMAINS OF A FAGGOT FIRE WERE SMOULDERING BEFORE A SHRINE WHICH WAS
LIGHTED BY A SINGLE CANDLE KNELT AN AGED MAN AND ON AN OLD WOODEN BOX
AT HIS SIDE LAY AN OPEN BOOK AND A HUMAN SKULL
THE MAN WAS OF LARGE
BONY FRAME HIS HAIR AND WHISKERS WERE VERY LONG AND SNOWY WHITE HE
WAS CLOTHED IN A ROBE OF SHEEPSKINS WHICH REACHED FROM HIS NECK TO HIS
HEELS
A HOLY HERMIT SAID THE KING TO HIMSELF NOW AM I INDEED FORTUNATE
THE HERMIT ROSE FROM HIS KNEES THE KING KNOCKED
A DEEP VOICE
RESPONDED
ENTER BUT LEAVE SIN BEHIND FOR THE GROUND WHEREON THOU SHALT STAND
IS HOLY
THE KING ENTERED AND PAUSED
THE HERMIT TURNED A PAIR OF GLEAMING
UNRESTFUL EYES UPON HIM AND SAID
WHO ART THOU
I AM THE KING CAME THE ANSWER WITH PLACID SIMPLICITY
WELCOME KING CRIED THE HERMIT WITH ENTHUSIASM
THEN BUSTLING
ABOUT WITH FEVERISH ACTIVITY AND CONSTANTLY SAYING WELCOME WELCOME
HE ARRANGED HIS BENCH SEATED THE KING ON IT BY THE HEARTH THREW SOME
FAGGOTS ON THE FIRE AND FINALLY FELL TO PACING THE FLOOR WITH A NERVOUS
STRIDE
WELCOME MANY HAVE SOUGHT SANCTUARY HERE BUT THEY WERE NOT WORTHY
AND WERE TURNED AWAY
BUT A KING WHO CASTS HIS CROWN AWAY AND DESPISES
THE VAIN SPLENDOURS OF HIS OFFICE AND CLOTHES HIS BODY IN RAGS TO
DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO HOLINESS AND THE MORTIFICATION OF THE FLESH HE IS
WORTHY HE IS WELCOME HERE SHALL HE ABIDE ALL HIS DAYS TILL DEATH
COME THE KING HASTENED TO INTERRUPT AND EXPLAIN BUT THE HERMIT PAID
NO ATTENTION TO HIM DID NOT EVEN HEAR HIM APPARENTLY BUT WENT RIGHT
ON WITH HIS TALK WITH A RAISED VOICE AND A GROWING ENERGY
AND THOU
SHALT BE AT PEACE HERE
NONE SHALL FIND OUT THY REFUGE TO DISQUIET THEE
WITH SUPPLICATIONS TO RETURN TO THAT EMPTY AND FOOLISH LIFE WHICH GOD
HATH MOVED THEE TO ABANDON
THOU SHALT PRAY HERE THOU SHALT STUDY THE
BOOK THOU SHALT MEDITATE UPON THE FOLLIES AND DELUSIONS OF THIS WORLD
AND UPON THE SUBLIMITIES OF THE WORLD TO COME THOU SHALT FEED UPON
CRUSTS AND HERBS AND SCOURGE THY BODY WITH WHIPS DAILY TO THE
PURIFYING OF THY SOUL
THOU SHALT WEAR A HAIR SHIRT NEXT THY SKIN
THOU SHALT DRINK WATER ONLY AND THOU SHALT BE AT PEACE YES WHOLLY AT
PEACE FOR WHOSO COMES TO SEEK THEE SHALL GO HIS WAY AGAIN BAFFLED HE
SHALL NOT FIND THEE HE SHALL NOT MOLEST THEE
THE OLD MAN STILL PACING BACK AND FORTH CEASED TO SPEAK ALOUD AND
BEGAN TO MUTTER
THE KING SEIZED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STATE HIS CASE
AND HE DID IT WITH AN ELOQUENCE INSPIRED BY UNEASINESS AND APPREHENSION
BUT THE HERMIT WENT ON MUTTERING AND GAVE NO HEED
AND STILL
MUTTERING HE APPROACHED THE KING AND SAID IMPRESSIVELY
'SH I WILL TELL YOU A SECRET HE BENT DOWN TO IMPART IT BUT
CHECKED HIMSELF AND ASSUMED A LISTENING ATTITUDE
AFTER A MOMENT
OR TWO HE WENT ON TIPTOE TO THE WINDOW OPENING PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND
PEERED AROUND IN THE GLOAMING THEN CAME TIPTOEING BACK AGAIN PUT HIS
FACE CLOSE DOWN TO THE KING'S AND WHISPERED
I AM AN ARCHANGEL
THE KING STARTED VIOLENTLY AND SAID TO HIMSELF WOULD GOD I WERE WITH
THE OUTLAWS AGAIN FOR LO NOW AM I THE PRISONER OF A MADMAN HIS
APPREHENSIONS WERE HEIGHTENED AND THEY SHOWED PLAINLY IN HIS FACE
IN
A LOW EXCITED VOICE THE HERMIT CONTINUED
I SEE YOU FEEL MY ATMOSPHERE THERE'S AWE IN YOUR FACE NONE MAY
BE IN THIS ATMOSPHERE AND NOT BE THUS AFFECTED FOR IT IS THE VERY
ATMOSPHERE OF HEAVEN
I GO THITHER AND RETURN IN THE TWINKLING OF AN
EYE
I WAS MADE AN ARCHANGEL ON THIS VERY SPOT IT IS FIVE YEARS AGO
BY ANGELS SENT FROM HEAVEN TO CONFER THAT AWFUL DIGNITY
THEIR PRESENCE
FILLED THIS PLACE WITH AN INTOLERABLE BRIGHTNESS
AND THEY KNELT TO ME
KING YES THEY KNELT TO ME FOR I WAS GREATER THAN THEY
I HAVE WALKED
IN THE COURTS OF HEAVEN AND HELD SPEECH WITH THE PATRIARCHS
TOUCH
MY HAND BE NOT AFRAID TOUCH IT
THERE NOW THOU HAST TOUCHED A HAND
WHICH HAS BEEN CLASPED BY ABRAHAM AND ISAAC AND JACOB FOR I HAVE
WALKED IN THE GOLDEN COURTS I HAVE SEEN THE DEITY FACE TO FACE HE
PAUSED TO GIVE THIS SPEECH EFFECT THEN HIS FACE SUDDENLY CHANGED AND
HE STARTED TO HIS FEET AGAIN SAYING WITH ANGRY ENERGY YES I AM AN
ARCHANGEL A MERE ARCHANGEL I THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POPE IT IS
VERILY TRUE
I WAS TOLD IT FROM HEAVEN IN A DREAM TWENTY YEARS AGO
AH YES I WAS TO BE POPE AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN POPE FOR HEAVEN
HAD SAID IT BUT THE KING DISSOLVED MY RELIGIOUS HOUSE AND I POOR
OBSCURE UNFRIENDED MONK WAS CAST HOMELESS UPON THE WORLD ROBBED OF MY
MIGHTY DESTINY HERE HE BEGAN TO MUMBLE AGAIN AND BEAT HIS FOREHEAD IN
FUTILE RAGE WITH HIS FIST NOW AND THEN ARTICULATING A VENOMOUS CURSE
AND NOW AND THEN A PATHETIC WHEREFORE I AM NOUGHT BUT AN ARCHANGEL I
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN POPE
SO HE WENT ON FOR AN HOUR WHILST THE POOR LITTLE KING SAT AND
SUFFERED
THEN ALL AT ONCE THE OLD MAN'S FRENZY DEPARTED AND HE BECAME
ALL GENTLENESS
HIS VOICE SOFTENED HE CAME DOWN OUT OF HIS CLOUDS AND
FELL TO PRATTLING ALONG SO SIMPLY AND SO HUMANLY THAT HE SOON WON THE
KING'S HEART COMPLETELY
THE OLD DEVOTEE MOVED THE BOY NEARER TO THE
FIRE AND MADE HIM COMFORTABLE DOCTORED HIS SMALL BRUISES AND ABRASIONS
WITH A DEFT AND TENDER HAND AND THEN SET ABOUT PREPARING AND COOKING A
SUPPER CHATTING PLEASANTLY ALL THE TIME AND OCCASIONALLY STROKING THE
LAD'S CHEEK OR PATTING HIS HEAD IN SUCH A GENTLY CARESSING WAY THAT IN
A LITTLE WHILE ALL THE FEAR AND REPULSION INSPIRED BY THE ARCHANGEL WERE
CHANGED TO REVERENCE AND AFFECTION FOR THE MAN
THIS HAPPY STATE OF THINGS CONTINUED WHILE THE TWO ATE THE SUPPER THEN
AFTER A PRAYER BEFORE THE SHRINE THE HERMIT PUT THE BOY TO BED IN A
SMALL ADJOINING ROOM TUCKING HIM IN AS SNUGLY AND LOVINGLY AS A MOTHER
MIGHT AND SO WITH A PARTING CARESS LEFT HIM AND SAT DOWN BY THE
FIRE AND BEGAN TO POKE THE BRANDS ABOUT IN AN ABSENT AND AIMLESS WAY
PRESENTLY HE PAUSED THEN TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SEVERAL TIMES WITH HIS
FINGERS AS IF TRYING TO RECALL SOME THOUGHT WHICH HAD ESCAPED FROM HIS
MIND
APPARENTLY HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL
NOW HE STARTED QUICKLY UP AND
ENTERED HIS GUEST'S ROOM AND SAID
THOU ART KING
YES WAS THE RESPONSE DROWSILY UTTERED
WHAT KING
OF ENGLAND
OF ENGLAND THEN HENRY IS GONE
ALACK IT IS SO
I AM HIS SON
A BLACK FROWN SETTLED DOWN UPON THE HERMIT'S FACE AND HE CLENCHED HIS
BONY HANDS WITH A VINDICTIVE ENERGY
HE STOOD A FEW MOMENTS BREATHING
FAST AND SWALLOWING REPEATEDLY THEN SAID IN A HUSKY VOICE
DOST KNOW IT WAS HE THAT TURNED US OUT INTO THE WORLD HOUSELESS AND
HOMELESS
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE
THE OLD MAN BENT DOWN AND SCANNED THE BOY'S
REPOSEFUL FACE AND LISTENED TO HIS PLACID BREATHING
HE SLEEPS SLEEPS
SOUNDLY AND THE FROWN VANISHED AWAY AND GAVE PLACE TO AN EXPRESSION OF
EVIL SATISFACTION
A SMILE FLITTED ACROSS THE DREAMING BOY'S FEATURES
THE HERMIT MUTTERED SO HIS HEART IS HAPPY AND HE TURNED AWAY
HE
WENT STEALTHILY ABOUT THE PLACE SEEKING HERE AND THERE FOR SOMETHING
NOW AND THEN HALTING TO LISTEN NOW AND THEN JERKING HIS HEAD AROUND
AND CASTING A QUICK GLANCE TOWARD THE BED AND ALWAYS MUTTERING ALWAYS
MUMBLING TO HIMSELF
AT LAST HE FOUND WHAT HE SEEMED TO WANT A RUSTY
OLD BUTCHER KNIFE AND A WHETSTONE
THEN HE CREPT TO HIS PLACE BY THE
FIRE SAT HIMSELF DOWN AND BEGAN TO WHET THE KNIFE SOFTLY ON THE STONE
STILL MUTTERING MUMBLING EJACULATING
THE WINDS SIGHED AROUND THE
LONELY PLACE THE MYSTERIOUS VOICES OF THE NIGHT FLOATED BY OUT OF THE
DISTANCES
THE SHINING EYES OF VENTURESOME MICE AND RATS PEERED OUT AT
THE OLD MAN FROM CRACKS AND COVERTS BUT HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK RAPT
ABSORBED AND NOTED NONE OF THESE THINGS
AT LONG INTERVALS HE DREW HIS THUMB ALONG THE EDGE OF HIS KNIFE AND
NODDED HIS HEAD WITH SATISFACTION
IT GROWS SHARPER HE SAID YES
IT GROWS SHARPER
HE TOOK NO NOTE OF THE FLIGHT OF TIME BUT WORKED TRANQUILLY ON
ENTERTAINING HIMSELF WITH HIS THOUGHTS WHICH BROKE OUT OCCASIONALLY IN
ARTICULATE SPEECH
HIS FATHER WROUGHT US EVIL HE DESTROYED US AND IS GONE DOWN INTO THE
ETERNAL FIRES YES DOWN INTO THE ETERNAL FIRES HE ESCAPED US BUT IT
WAS GOD'S WILL YES IT WAS GOD'S WILL WE MUST NOT REPINE
BUT HE
HATH NOT ESCAPED THE FIRES NO HE HATH NOT ESCAPED THE FIRES THE
CONSUMING UNPITYING REMORSELESS FIRES AND THEY ARE EVERLASTING
AND SO HE WROUGHT AND STILL WROUGHT MUMBLING CHUCKLING A LOW RASPING
CHUCKLE AT TIMES AND AT TIMES BREAKING AGAIN INTO WORDS
IT WAS HIS FATHER THAT DID IT ALL
I AM BUT AN ARCHANGEL BUT FOR HIM
I SHOULD BE POPE
THE KING STIRRED
THE HERMIT SPRANG NOISELESSLY TO THE BEDSIDE AND
WENT DOWN UPON HIS KNEES BENDING OVER THE PROSTRATE FORM WITH HIS KNIFE
UPLIFTED
THE BOY STIRRED AGAIN HIS EYES CAME OPEN FOR AN INSTANT BUT
THERE WAS NO SPECULATION IN THEM THEY SAW NOTHING THE NEXT MOMENT HIS
TRANQUIL BREATHING SHOWED THAT HIS SLEEP WAS SOUND ONCE MORE
THE HERMIT WATCHED AND LISTENED FOR A TIME KEEPING HIS POSITION AND
SCARCELY BREATHING THEN HE SLOWLY LOWERED HIS ARMS AND PRESENTLY CREPT
AWAY SAYING
IT IS LONG PAST MIDNIGHT IT IS NOT BEST THAT HE SHOULD CRY OUT LEST
BY ACCIDENT SOMEONE BE PASSING
HE GLIDED ABOUT HIS HOVEL GATHERING A RAG HERE A THONG THERE AND
ANOTHER ONE YONDER THEN HE RETURNED AND BY CAREFUL AND GENTLE HANDLING
HE MANAGED TO TIE THE KING'S ANKLES TOGETHER WITHOUT WAKING HIM
NEXT
HE ESSAYED TO TIE THE WRISTS HE MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO CROSS THEM
BUT THE BOY ALWAYS DREW ONE HAND OR THE OTHER AWAY JUST AS THE CORD WAS
READY TO BE APPLIED BUT AT LAST WHEN THE ARCHANGEL WAS ALMOST READY
TO DESPAIR THE BOY CROSSED HIS HANDS HIMSELF AND THE NEXT MOMENT
THEY WERE BOUND
NOW A BANDAGE WAS PASSED UNDER THE SLEEPER'S CHIN AND
BROUGHT UP OVER HIS HEAD AND TIED FAST AND SO SOFTLY SO GRADUALLY
AND SO DEFTLY WERE THE KNOTS DRAWN TOGETHER AND COMPACTED THAT THE BOY
SLEPT PEACEFULLY THROUGH IT ALL WITHOUT STIRRING
CHAPTER XXI
HENDON TO THE RESCUE
THE OLD MAN GLIDED AWAY STOOPING STEALTHY CAT LIKE AND BROUGHT THE
LOW BENCH
HE SEATED HIMSELF UPON IT HALF HIS BODY IN THE DIM AND
FLICKERING LIGHT AND THE OTHER HALF IN SHADOW AND SO WITH HIS CRAVING
EYES BENT UPON THE SLUMBERING BOY HE KEPT HIS PATIENT VIGIL THERE
HEEDLESS OF THE DRIFT OF TIME AND SOFTLY WHETTED HIS KNIFE AND MUMBLED
AND CHUCKLED AND IN ASPECT AND ATTITUDE HE RESEMBLED NOTHING SO MUCH AS
A GRIZZLY MONSTROUS SPIDER GLOATING OVER SOME HAPLESS INSECT THAT LAY
BOUND AND HELPLESS IN HIS WEB
AFTER A LONG WHILE THE OLD MAN WHO WAS STILL GAZING YET NOT SEEING
HIS MIND HAVING SETTLED INTO A DREAMY ABSTRACTION OBSERVED ON A
SUDDEN THAT THE BOY'S EYES WERE OPEN WIDE OPEN AND STARING STARING
UP IN FROZEN HORROR AT THE KNIFE
THE SMILE OF A GRATIFIED DEVIL CREPT
OVER THE OLD MAN'S FACE AND HE SAID WITHOUT CHANGING HIS ATTITUDE OR
HIS OCCUPATION
SON OF HENRY THE EIGHTH HAST THOU PRAYED
THE BOY STRUGGLED HELPLESSLY IN HIS BONDS AND AT THE SAME TIME FORCED
A SMOTHERED SOUND THROUGH HIS CLOSED JAWS WHICH THE HERMIT CHOSE TO
INTERPRET AS AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION
THEN PRAY AGAIN
PRAY THE PRAYER FOR THE DYING
A SHUDDER SHOOK THE BOY'S FRAME AND HIS FACE BLENCHED
THEN HE
STRUGGLED AGAIN TO FREE HIMSELF TURNING AND TWISTING HIMSELF THIS WAY
AND THAT TUGGING FRANTICALLY FIERCELY DESPERATELY BUT USELESSLY TO
BURST HIS FETTERS AND ALL THE WHILE THE OLD OGRE SMILED DOWN UPON HIM
AND NODDED HIS HEAD AND PLACIDLY WHETTED HIS KNIFE MUMBLING FROM TIME
TO TIME THE MOMENTS ARE PRECIOUS THEY ARE FEW AND PRECIOUS PRAY THE
PRAYER FOR THE DYING
THE BOY UTTERED A DESPAIRING GROAN AND CEASED FROM HIS STRUGGLES
PANTING
THE TEARS CAME THEN AND TRICKLED ONE AFTER THE OTHER DOWN
HIS FACE BUT THIS PITEOUS SIGHT WROUGHT NO SOFTENING EFFECT UPON THE
SAVAGE OLD MAN
THE DAWN WAS COMING NOW THE HERMIT OBSERVED IT AND SPOKE UP SHARPLY
WITH A TOUCH OF NERVOUS APPREHENSION IN HIS VOICE
I MAY NOT INDULGE THIS ECSTASY LONGER THE NIGHT IS ALREADY GONE
IT
SEEMS BUT A MOMENT ONLY A MOMENT WOULD IT HAD ENDURED A YEAR SEED OF
THE CHURCH'S SPOILER CLOSE THY PERISHING EYES AN' THOU FEAREST TO LOOK
UPON
THE REST WAS LOST IN INARTICULATE MUTTERINGS
THE OLD MAN SANK UPON HIS
KNEES HIS KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND BENT HIMSELF OVER THE MOANING BOY
HARK THERE WAS A SOUND OF VOICES NEAR THE CABIN THE KNIFE DROPPED
FROM THE HERMIT'S HAND HE CAST A SHEEPSKIN OVER THE BOY AND STARTED UP
TREMBLING
THE SOUNDS INCREASED AND PRESENTLY THE VOICES BECAME ROUGH
AND ANGRY THEN CAME BLOWS AND CRIES FOR HELP THEN A CLATTER OF SWIFT
FOOTSTEPS RETREATING
IMMEDIATELY CAME A SUCCESSION OF THUNDERING
KNOCKS UPON THE CABIN DOOR FOLLOWED BY
HULLO O O OPEN AND DESPATCH IN THE NAME OF ALL THE DEVILS
OH THIS WAS THE BLESSEDEST SOUND THAT HAD EVER MADE MUSIC IN THE KING'S
EARS FOR IT WAS MILES HENDON'S VOICE
THE HERMIT GRINDING HIS TEETH IN IMPOTENT RAGE MOVED SWIFTLY OUT OF
THE BEDCHAMBER CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND STRAIGHTWAY THE KING
HEARD A TALK TO THIS EFFECT PROCEEDING FROM THE 'CHAPEL'
HOMAGE AND GREETING REVEREND SIR WHERE IS THE BOY MY BOY
WHAT BOY FRIEND
WHAT BOY LIE ME NO LIES SIR PRIEST PLAY ME NO DECEPTIONS I AM NOT
IN THE HUMOUR FOR IT
NEAR TO THIS PLACE I CAUGHT THE SCOUNDRELS WHO I
JUDGED DID STEAL HIM FROM ME AND I MADE THEM CONFESS THEY SAID HE WAS
AT LARGE AGAIN AND THEY HAD TRACKED HIM TO YOUR DOOR
THEY SHOWED ME
HIS VERY FOOTPRINTS
NOW PALTER NO MORE FOR LOOK YOU HOLY SIR AN'
THOU PRODUCE HIM NOT WHERE IS THE BOY
O GOOD SIR PERADVENTURE YOU MEAN THE RAGGED REGAL VAGRANT THAT TARRIED
HERE THE NIGHT
IF SUCH AS YOU TAKE AN INTEREST IN SUCH AS HE KNOW

HE WILL BE BACK ANON
HOW SOON HOW SOON COME WASTE NOT THE TIME CANNOT I OVERTAKE HIM
HOW SOON WILL HE BE BACK
THOU NEED'ST NOT STIR HE WILL RETURN QUICKLY
SO BE IT THEN
I WILL TRY TO WAIT
BUT STOP YOU SENT HIM OF AN
ERRAND YOU VERILY THIS IS A LIE HE WOULD NOT GO

THOU HAST LIED

MAN
FOR ANY MAN NO HAPLY NOT
BUT I AM NOT A MAN
WHAT NOW O' GOD'S NAME WHAT ART THOU THEN
IT IS A SECRET MARK THOU REVEAL IT NOT
I AM AN ARCHANGEL
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS EJACULATION FROM MILES HENDON NOT ALTOGETHER
UNPROFANE FOLLOWED BY
THIS DOTH WELL AND TRULY ACCOUNT FOR HIS COMPLAISANCE RIGHT WELL
I KNEW HE WOULD BUDGE NOR HAND NOR FOOT IN THE MENIAL SERVICE OF ANY
MORTAL BUT LORD EVEN A KING MUST OBEY WHEN AN ARCHANGEL GIVES THE
WORD O' COMMAND LET ME 'SH WHAT NOISE WAS THAT
ALL THIS WHILE THE LITTLE KING HAD BEEN YONDER ALTERNATELY QUAKING WITH
TERROR AND TREMBLING WITH HOPE AND ALL THE WHILE TOO HE HAD THROWN
ALL THE STRENGTH HE COULD INTO HIS ANGUISHED MOANINGS CONSTANTLY
EXPECTING THEM TO REACH HENDON'S EAR BUT ALWAYS REALISING WITH
BITTERNESS THAT THEY FAILED OR AT LEAST MADE NO IMPRESSION
SO THIS
LAST REMARK OF HIS SERVANT CAME AS COMES A REVIVING BREATH FROM FRESH
FIELDS TO THE DYING AND HE EXERTED HIMSELF ONCE MORE AND WITH ALL HIS
ENERGY JUST AS THE HERMIT WAS SAYING
NOISE I HEARD ONLY THE WIND
MAYHAP IT WAS
YES DOUBTLESS THAT WAS IT
I HAVE BEEN HEARING IT
FAINTLY ALL THE THERE IT IS AGAIN IT IS NOT THE WIND WHAT AN ODD
SOUND COME WE WILL HUNT IT OUT
NOW THE KING'S JOY WAS NEARLY INSUPPORTABLE
HIS TIRED LUNGS DID
THEIR UTMOST AND HOPEFULLY TOO BUT THE SEALED JAWS AND THE MUFFLING
SHEEPSKIN SADLY CRIPPLED THE EFFORT
THEN THE POOR FELLOW'S HEART SANK
TO HEAR THE HERMIT SAY
AH IT CAME FROM WITHOUT I THINK FROM THE COPSE YONDER
COME I WILL
LEAD THE WAY
THE KING HEARD THE TWO PASS OUT TALKING HEARD THEIR FOOTSTEPS DIE
QUICKLY AWAY THEN HE WAS ALONE WITH A BODING BROODING AWFUL SILENCE
IT SEEMED AN AGE TILL HE HEARD THE STEPS AND VOICES APPROACHING
AGAIN AND THIS TIME HE HEARD AN ADDED SOUND THE TRAMPLING OF HOOFS
APPARENTLY
THEN HE HEARD HENDON SAY
I WILL NOT WAIT LONGER
I CANNOT WAIT LONGER
HE HAS LOST HIS WAY
IN THIS THICK WOOD
WHICH DIRECTION TOOK HE QUICK POINT IT OUT TO
ME
HE BUT WAIT I WILL GO WITH THEE
GOOD GOOD WHY TRULY THOU ART BETTER THAN THY LOOKS
MARRY I DO
NOT THINK THERE'S NOT ANOTHER ARCHANGEL WITH SO RIGHT A HEART AS THINE
WILT RIDE WILT TAKE THE WEE DONKEY THAT'S FOR MY BOY OR WILT THOU
FORK THY HOLY LEGS OVER THIS ILL CONDITIONED SLAVE OF A MULE THAT I HAVE
PROVIDED FOR MYSELF AND HAD BEEN CHEATED IN TOO HAD HE COST BUT THE
INDIFFERENT SUM OF A MONTH'S USURY ON A BRASS FARTHING LET TO A TINKER
OUT OF WORK
NO RIDE THY MULE AND LEAD THINE ASS I AM SURER ON MINE OWN FEET AND
WILL WALK
THEN PRITHEE MIND THE LITTLE BEAST FOR ME WHILE I TAKE MY LIFE IN MY
HANDS AND MAKE WHAT SUCCESS I MAY TOWARD MOUNTING THE BIG ONE
THEN FOLLOWED A CONFUSION OF KICKS CUFFS TRAMPLINGS AND PLUNGINGS
ACCOMPANIED BY A THUNDEROUS INTERMINGLING OF VOLLEYED CURSES AND
FINALLY A BITTER APOSTROPHE TO THE MULE WHICH MUST HAVE BROKEN ITS
SPIRIT FOR HOSTILITIES SEEMED TO CEASE FROM THAT MOMENT
WITH UNUTTERABLE MISERY THE FETTERED LITTLE KING HEARD THE VOICES AND
FOOTSTEPS FADE AWAY AND DIE OUT
ALL HOPE FORSOOK HIM NOW FOR THE
MOMENT AND A DULL DESPAIR SETTLED DOWN UPON HIS HEART
MY ONLY FRIEND
IS DECEIVED AND GOT RID OF HE SAID THE HERMIT WILL RETURN AND HE
FINISHED WITH A GASP AND AT ONCE FELL TO STRUGGLING SO FRANTICALLY WITH
HIS BONDS AGAIN THAT HE SHOOK OFF THE SMOTHERING SHEEPSKIN
AND NOW HE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN THE SOUND CHILLED HIM TO THE
MARROW ALREADY HE SEEMED TO FEEL THE KNIFE AT HIS THROAT
HORROR MADE
HIM CLOSE HIS EYES HORROR MADE HIM OPEN THEM AGAIN AND BEFORE HIM
STOOD JOHN CANTY AND HUGO
HE WOULD HAVE SAID THANK GOD IF HIS JAWS HAD BEEN FREE
A MOMENT OR TWO LATER HIS LIMBS WERE AT LIBERTY AND HIS CAPTORS EACH
GRIPPING HIM BY AN ARM WERE HURRYING HIM WITH ALL SPEED THROUGH THE
FOREST
CHAPTER XXII
A VICTIM OF TREACHERY
ONCE MORE 'KING FOO FOO THE FIRST' WAS ROVING WITH THE TRAMPS AND
OUTLAWS A BUTT FOR THEIR COARSE JESTS AND DULL WITTED RAILLERIES AND
SOMETIMES THE VICTIM OF SMALL SPITEFULNESS AT THE HANDS OF CANTY AND
HUGO WHEN THE RUFFLER'S BACK WAS TURNED
NONE BUT CANTY AND HUGO REALLY
DISLIKED HIM
SOME OF THE OTHERS LIKED HIM AND ALL ADMIRED HIS PLUCK
AND SPIRIT
DURING TWO OR THREE DAYS HUGO IN WHOSE WARD AND CHARGE
THE KING WAS DID WHAT HE COVERTLY COULD TO MAKE THE BOY UNCOMFORTABLE
AND AT NIGHT DURING THE CUSTOMARY ORGIES HE AMUSED THE COMPANY BY
PUTTING SMALL INDIGNITIES UPON HIM ALWAYS AS IF BY ACCIDENT
TWICE HE
STEPPED UPON THE KING'S TOES ACCIDENTALLY AND THE KING AS BECAME HIS
ROYALTY WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY UNCONSCIOUS OF IT AND INDIFFERENT TO IT BUT
THE THIRD TIME HUGO ENTERTAINED HIMSELF IN THAT WAY THE KING FELLED
HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A CUDGEL TO THE PRODIGIOUS DELIGHT OF THE TRIBE
HUGO CONSUMED WITH ANGER AND SHAME SPRANG UP SEIZED A CUDGEL AND
CAME AT HIS SMALL ADVERSARY IN A FURY
INSTANTLY A RING WAS FORMED
AROUND THE GLADIATORS AND THE BETTING AND CHEERING BEGAN
BUT POOR HUGO STOOD NO CHANCE WHATEVER
HIS FRANTIC AND LUBBERLY
'PRENTICE WORK FOUND BUT A POOR MARKET FOR ITSELF WHEN PITTED AGAINST
AN ARM WHICH HAD BEEN TRAINED BY THE FIRST MASTERS OF EUROPE IN
SINGLE STICK QUARTER STAFF AND EVERY ART AND TRICK OF SWORDSMANSHIP
THE LITTLE KING STOOD ALERT BUT AT GRACEFUL EASE AND CAUGHT AND
TURNED ASIDE THE THICK RAIN OF BLOWS WITH A FACILITY AND PRECISION WHICH
SET THE MOTLEY ON LOOKERS WILD WITH ADMIRATION AND EVERY NOW AND THEN
WHEN HIS PRACTISED EYE DETECTED AN OPENING AND A LIGHTNING SWIFT RAP
UPON HUGO'S HEAD FOLLOWED AS A RESULT THE STORM OF CHEERS AND LAUGHTER
THAT SWEPT THE PLACE WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO HEAR
AT THE END OF
FIFTEEN MINUTES HUGO ALL BATTERED BRUISED AND THE TARGET FOR
A PITILESS BOMBARDMENT OF RIDICULE SLUNK FROM THE FIELD AND THE
UNSCATHED HERO OF THE FIGHT WAS SEIZED AND BORNE ALOFT UPON THE
SHOULDERS OF THE JOYOUS RABBLE TO THE PLACE OF HONOUR BESIDE THE
RUFFLER WHERE WITH VAST CEREMONY HE WAS CROWNED KING OF THE GAME COCKS
HIS MEANER TITLE BEING AT THE SAME TIME SOLEMNLY CANCELLED AND ANNULLED
AND A DECREE OF BANISHMENT FROM THE GANG PRONOUNCED AGAINST ANY WHO
SHOULD THENCEFORTH UTTER IT
ALL ATTEMPTS TO MAKE THE KING SERVICEABLE TO THE TROOP HAD FAILED
HE
HAD STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO ACT MOREOVER HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO ESCAPE
HE HAD BEEN THRUST INTO AN UNWATCHED KITCHEN THE FIRST DAY OF HIS
RETURN HE NOT ONLY CAME FORTH EMPTY HANDED BUT TRIED TO ROUSE THE
HOUSEMATES
HE WAS SENT OUT WITH A TINKER TO HELP HIM AT HIS WORK
HE WOULD NOT WORK MOREOVER HE THREATENED THE TINKER WITH HIS OWN
SOLDERING IRON AND FINALLY BOTH HUGO AND THE TINKER FOUND THEIR
HANDS FULL WITH THE MERE MATTER OF KEEPING HIS FROM GETTING AWAY
HE
DELIVERED THE THUNDERS OF HIS ROYALTY UPON THE HEADS OF ALL WHO HAMPERED
HIS LIBERTIES OR TRIED TO FORCE HIM TO SERVICE
HE WAS SENT OUT IN
HUGO'S CHARGE IN COMPANY WITH A SLATTERNLY WOMAN AND A DISEASED BABY
TO BEG BUT THE RESULT WAS NOT ENCOURAGING HE DECLINED TO PLEAD FOR THE
MENDICANTS OR BE A PARTY TO THEIR CAUSE IN ANY WAY
THUS SEVERAL DAYS WENT BY AND THE MISERIES OF THIS TRAMPING LIFE AND
THE WEARINESS AND SORDIDNESS AND MEANNESS AND VULGARITY OF IT BECAME
GRADUALLY AND STEADILY SO INTOLERABLE TO THE CAPTIVE THAT HE BEGAN AT
LAST TO FEEL THAT HIS RELEASE FROM THE HERMIT'S KNIFE MUST PROVE ONLY A
TEMPORARY RESPITE FROM DEATH AT BEST
BUT AT NIGHT IN HIS DREAMS THESE THINGS WERE FORGOTTEN AND HE WAS
ON HIS THRONE AND MASTER AGAIN
THIS OF COURSE INTENSIFIED THE
SUFFERINGS OF THE AWAKENING SO THE MORTIFICATIONS OF EACH SUCCEEDING
MORNING OF THE FEW THAT PASSED BETWEEN HIS RETURN TO BONDAGE AND THE
COMBAT WITH HUGO GREW BITTERER AND BITTERER AND HARDER AND HARDER TO
BEAR
THE MORNING AFTER THAT COMBAT HUGO GOT UP WITH A HEART FILLED WITH
VENGEFUL PURPOSES AGAINST THE KING
HE HAD TWO PLANS IN PARTICULAR
ONE WAS TO INFLICT UPON THE LAD WHAT WOULD BE TO HIS PROUD SPIRIT
AND 'IMAGINED' ROYALTY A PECULIAR HUMILIATION AND IF HE FAILED TO
ACCOMPLISH THIS HIS OTHER PLAN WAS TO PUT A CRIME OF SOME KIND UPON THE
KING AND THEN BETRAY HIM INTO THE IMPLACABLE CLUTCHES OF THE LAW
IN PURSUANCE OF THE FIRST PLAN HE PURPOSED TO PUT A 'CLIME' UPON THE
KING'S LEG RIGHTLY JUDGING THAT THAT WOULD MORTIFY HIM TO THE LAST AND
PERFECT DEGREE AND AS SOON AS THE CLIME SHOULD OPERATE HE MEANT TO GET
CANTY'S HELP AND FORCE THE KING TO EXPOSE HIS LEG IN THE HIGHWAY
AND BEG FOR ALMS
'CLIME' WAS THE CANT TERM FOR A SORE ARTIFICIALLY
CREATED
TO MAKE A CLIME THE OPERATOR MADE A PASTE OR POULTICE OF
UNSLAKED LIME SOAP AND THE RUST OF OLD IRON AND SPREAD IT UPON A
PIECE OF LEATHER WHICH WAS THEN BOUND TIGHTLY UPON THE LEG
THIS WOULD
PRESENTLY FRET OFF THE SKIN AND MAKE THE FLESH RAW AND ANGRY LOOKING
BLOOD WAS THEN RUBBED UPON THE LIMB WHICH BEING FULLY DRIED TOOK ON A
DARK AND REPULSIVE COLOUR
THEN A BANDAGE OF SOILED RAGS WAS PUT ON IN
A CLEVERLY CARELESS WAY WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE HIDEOUS ULCER TO BE SEEN
AND MOVE THE COMPASSION OF THE PASSER BY
8
HUGO GOT THE HELP OF THE TINKER WHOM THE KING HAD COWED WITH THE
SOLDERING IRON THEY TOOK THE BOY OUT ON A TINKERING TRAMP AND AS SOON
AS THEY WERE OUT OF SIGHT OF THE CAMP THEY THREW HIM DOWN AND THE TINKER
HELD HIM WHILE HUGO BOUND THE POULTICE TIGHT AND FAST UPON HIS LEG
THE KING RAGED AND STORMED AND PROMISED TO HANG THE TWO THE MOMENT THE
SCEPTRE WAS IN HIS HAND AGAIN BUT THEY KEPT A FIRM GRIP UPON HIM
AND ENJOYED HIS IMPOTENT STRUGGLING AND JEERED AT HIS THREATS
THIS
CONTINUED UNTIL THE POULTICE BEGAN TO BITE AND IN NO LONG TIME ITS WORK
WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTED IF THERE HAD BEEN NO INTERRUPTION
BUT THERE
WAS FOR ABOUT THIS TIME THE 'SLAVE' WHO HAD MADE THE SPEECH DENOUNCING
ENGLAND'S LAWS APPEARED ON THE SCENE AND PUT AN END TO THE ENTERPRISE
AND STRIPPED OFF THE POULTICE AND BANDAGE
THE KING WANTED TO BORROW HIS DELIVERER'S CUDGEL AND WARM THE JACKETS
OF THE TWO RASCALS ON THE SPOT BUT THE MAN SAID NO IT WOULD BRING
TROUBLE LEAVE THE MATTER TILL NIGHT THE WHOLE TRIBE BEING TOGETHER
THEN THE OUTSIDE WORLD WOULD NOT VENTURE TO INTERFERE OR INTERRUPT
HE
MARCHED THE PARTY BACK TO CAMP AND REPORTED THE AFFAIR TO THE RUFFLER
WHO LISTENED PONDERED AND THEN DECIDED THAT THE KING SHOULD NOT BE
AGAIN DETAILED TO BEG SINCE IT WAS PLAIN HE WAS WORTHY OF SOMETHING
HIGHER AND BETTER WHEREFORE ON THE SPOT HE PROMOTED HIM FROM THE
MENDICANT RANK AND APPOINTED HIM TO STEAL
HUGO WAS OVERJOYED
HE HAD ALREADY TRIED TO MAKE THE KING STEAL AND
FAILED BUT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE TROUBLE OF THAT SORT NOW FOR OF
COURSE THE KING WOULD NOT DREAM OF DEFYING A DISTINCT COMMAND DELIVERED
DIRECTLY FROM HEAD QUARTERS
SO HE PLANNED A RAID FOR THAT VERY
AFTERNOON PURPOSING TO GET THE KING IN THE LAW'S GRIP IN THE COURSE OF
IT AND TO DO IT TOO WITH SUCH INGENIOUS STRATEGY THAT IT SHOULD SEEM
TO BE ACCIDENTAL AND UNINTENTIONAL FOR THE KING OF THE GAME COCKS WAS
POPULAR NOW AND THE GANG MIGHT NOT DEAL OVER GENTLY WITH AN UNPOPULAR
MEMBER WHO PLAYED SO SERIOUS A TREACHERY UPON HIM AS THE DELIVERING HIM
OVER TO THE COMMON ENEMY THE LAW
VERY WELL
ALL IN GOOD TIME HUGO STROLLED OFF TO A NEIGHBOURING VILLAGE
WITH HIS PREY AND THE TWO DRIFTED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN ONE STREET AFTER
ANOTHER THE ONE WATCHING SHARPLY FOR A SURE CHANCE TO ACHIEVE HIS EVIL
PURPOSE AND THE OTHER WATCHING AS SHARPLY FOR A CHANCE TO DART AWAY AND
GET FREE OF HIS INFAMOUS CAPTIVITY FOR EVER
BOTH THREW AWAY SOME TOLERABLY FAIR LOOKING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH
IN THEIR SECRET HEARTS WERE RESOLVED TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE WORK THIS
TIME AND NEITHER MEANT TO ALLOW HIS FEVERED DESIRES TO SEDUCE HIM INTO
ANY VENTURE THAT HAD MUCH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT IT
HUGO'S CHANCE CAME FIRST
FOR AT LAST A WOMAN APPROACHED WHO CARRIED A
FAT PACKAGE OF SOME SORT IN A BASKET
HUGO'S EYES SPARKLED WITH SINFUL
PLEASURE AS HE SAID TO HIMSELF BREATH O' MY LIFE AN' I CAN BUT
PUT THAT UPON HIM 'TIS GOOD DEN AND GOD KEEP THEE KING OF THE
GAME COCKS HE WAITED AND WATCHED OUTWARDLY PATIENT BUT INWARDLY
CONSUMING WITH EXCITEMENT TILL THE WOMAN HAD PASSED BY AND THE TIME
WAS RIPE THEN SAID IN A LOW VOICE
TARRY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND DARTED STEALTHILY AFTER THE PREY
THE KING'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH JOY HE COULD MAKE HIS ESCAPE NOW IF
HUGO'S QUEST ONLY CARRIED HIM FAR ENOUGH AWAY
BUT HE WAS TO HAVE NO SUCH LUCK
HUGO CREPT BEHIND THE WOMAN SNATCHED
THE PACKAGE AND CAME RUNNING BACK WRAPPING IT IN AN OLD PIECE OF
BLANKET WHICH HE CARRIED ON HIS ARM
THE HUE AND CRY WAS RAISED IN A
MOMENT BY THE WOMAN WHO KNEW HER LOSS BY THE LIGHTENING OF HER BURDEN
ALTHOUGH SHE HAD NOT SEEN THE PILFERING DONE
HUGO THRUST THE BUNDLE
INTO THE KING'S HANDS WITHOUT HALTING SAYING
NOW SPEED YE AFTER ME WITH THE REST AND CRY 'STOP THIEF BUT MIND YE
LEAD THEM ASTRAY
THE NEXT MOMENT HUGO TURNED A CORNER AND DARTED DOWN A CROOKED
ALLEY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT OR TWO HE LOUNGED INTO VIEW AGAIN LOOKING
INNOCENT AND INDIFFERENT AND TOOK UP A POSITION BEHIND A POST TO WATCH
RESULTS
THE INSULTED KING THREW THE BUNDLE ON THE GROUND AND THE BLANKET FELL
AWAY FROM IT JUST AS THE WOMAN ARRIVED WITH AN AUGMENTING CROWD AT HER
HEELS SHE SEIZED THE KING'S WRIST WITH ONE HAND SNATCHED UP HER BUNDLE
WITH THE OTHER AND BEGAN TO POUR OUT A TIRADE OF ABUSE UPON THE BOY
WHILE HE STRUGGLED WITHOUT SUCCESS TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HER GRIP
HUGO HAD SEEN ENOUGH HIS ENEMY WAS CAPTURED AND THE LAW WOULD GET HIM
NOW SO HE SLIPPED AWAY JUBILANT AND CHUCKLING AND WENDED CAMPWARDS
FRAMING A JUDICIOUS VERSION OF THE MATTER TO GIVE TO THE RUFFLER'S CREW
AS HE STRODE ALONG
THE KING CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE IN THE WOMAN'S STRONG GRASP AND NOW AND
THEN CRIED OUT IN VEXATION
UNHAND ME THOU FOOLISH CREATURE IT WAS NOT I THAT BEREAVED THEE OF
THY PALTRY GOODS
THE CROWD CLOSED AROUND THREATENING THE KING AND CALLING HIM NAMES A
BRAWNY BLACKSMITH IN LEATHER APRON AND SLEEVES ROLLED TO HIS ELBOWS
MADE A REACH FOR HIM SAYING HE WOULD TROUNCE HIM WELL FOR A LESSON
BUT JUST THEN A LONG SWORD FLASHED IN THE AIR AND FELL WITH CONVINCING
FORCE UPON THE MAN'S ARM FLAT SIDE DOWN THE FANTASTIC OWNER OF IT
REMARKING PLEASANTLY AT THE SAME TIME
MARRY GOOD SOULS LET US PROCEED GENTLY NOT WITH ILL BLOOD AND
UNCHARITABLE WORDS
THIS IS MATTER FOR THE LAW'S CONSIDERATION
NOT PRIVATE AND UNOFFICIAL HANDLING
LOOSE THY HOLD FROM THE BOY
GOODWIFE
THE BLACKSMITH AVERAGED THE STALWART SOLDIER WITH A GLANCE THEN WENT
MUTTERING AWAY RUBBING HIS ARM THE WOMAN RELEASED THE BOY'S WRIST
RELUCTANTLY THE CROWD EYED THE STRANGER UNLOVINGLY BUT PRUDENTLY
CLOSED THEIR MOUTHS
THE KING SPRANG TO HIS DELIVERER'S SIDE WITH
FLUSHED CHEEKS AND SPARKLING EYES EXCLAIMING
THOU HAST LAGGED SORELY BUT THOU COMEST IN GOOD SEASON NOW SIR
MILES CARVE ME THIS RABBLE TO RAGS
CHAPTER XXIII
THE PRINCE A PRISONER
HENDON FORCED BACK A SMILE AND BENT DOWN AND WHISPERED IN THE KING'S
EAR
SOFTLY SOFTLY MY PRINCE WAG THY TONGUE WARILY NAY SUFFER IT NOT TO
WAG AT ALL
TRUST IN ME ALL SHALL GO WELL IN THE END THEN HE ADDED
TO HIMSELF SIR MILES BLESS ME I HAD TOTALLY FORGOT I WAS A
KNIGHT LORD HOW MARVELLOUS A THING IT IS THE GRIP HIS MEMORY DOTH
TAKE UPON HIS QUAINT AND CRAZY FANCIES
AN EMPTY AND FOOLISH TITLE
IS MINE AND YET IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE DESERVED IT FOR I THINK IT IS
MORE HONOUR TO BE HELD WORTHY TO BE A SPECTRE KNIGHT IN HIS KINGDOM OF
DREAMS AND SHADOWS THAN TO BE HELD BASE ENOUGH TO BE AN EARL IN SOME OF
THE REAL KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD
THE CROWD FELL APART TO ADMIT A CONSTABLE WHO APPROACHED AND WAS ABOUT
TO LAY HIS HAND UPON THE KING'S SHOULDER WHEN HENDON SAID
GENTLY GOOD FRIEND WITHHOLD YOUR HAND HE SHALL GO PEACEABLY I AM
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
LEAD ON WE WILL FOLLOW
THE OFFICER LED WITH THE WOMAN AND HER BUNDLE MILES AND THE KING
FOLLOWED AFTER WITH THE CROWD AT THEIR HEELS
THE KING WAS INCLINED TO
REBEL BUT HENDON SAID TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE
REFLECT SIRE YOUR LAWS ARE THE WHOLESOME BREATH OF YOUR OWN ROYALTY
SHALL THEIR SOURCE RESIST THEM YET REQUIRE THE BRANCHES TO RESPECT
THEM APPARENTLY ONE OF THESE LAWS HAS BEEN BROKEN WHEN THE KING IS ON
HIS THRONE AGAIN CAN IT EVER GRIEVE HIM TO REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE WAS
SEEMINGLY A PRIVATE PERSON HE LOYALLY SANK THE KING IN THE CITIZEN AND
SUBMITTED TO ITS AUTHORITY
THOU ART RIGHT SAY NO MORE THOU SHALT SEE THAT WHATSOEVER THE KING
OF ENGLAND REQUIRES A SUBJECT TO SUFFER UNDER THE LAW HE WILL HIMSELF
SUFFER WHILE HE HOLDETH THE STATION OF A SUBJECT
WHEN THE WOMAN WAS CALLED UPON TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE JUSTICE OF THE
PEACE SHE SWORE THAT THE SMALL PRISONER AT THE BAR WAS THE PERSON WHO
HAD COMMITTED THE THEFT THERE WAS NONE ABLE TO SHOW THE CONTRARY SO
THE KING STOOD CONVICTED
THE BUNDLE WAS NOW UNROLLED AND WHEN THE
CONTENTS PROVED TO BE A PLUMP LITTLE DRESSED PIG THE JUDGE LOOKED
TROUBLED WHILST HENDON TURNED PALE AND HIS BODY WAS THRILLED WITH AN
ELECTRIC SHIVER OF DISMAY BUT THE KING REMAINED UNMOVED PROTECTED
BY HIS IGNORANCE
THE JUDGE MEDITATED DURING AN OMINOUS PAUSE THEN
TURNED TO THE WOMAN WITH THE QUESTION
WHAT DOST THOU HOLD THIS PROPERTY TO BE WORTH
THE WOMAN COURTESIED AND REPLIED
THREE SHILLINGS AND EIGHTPENCE YOUR WORSHIP I COULD NOT ABATE A PENNY
AND SET FORTH THE VALUE HONESTLY
THE JUSTICE GLANCED AROUND UNCOMFORTABLY UPON THE CROWD THEN NODDED TO
THE CONSTABLE AND SAID
CLEAR THE COURT AND CLOSE THE DOORS
IT WAS DONE
NONE REMAINED BUT THE TWO OFFICIALS THE ACCUSED THE
ACCUSER AND MILES HENDON
THIS LATTER WAS RIGID AND COLOURLESS AND
ON HIS FOREHEAD BIG DROPS OF COLD SWEAT GATHERED BROKE AND BLENDED
TOGETHER AND TRICKLED DOWN HIS FACE
THE JUDGE TURNED TO THE WOMAN
AGAIN AND SAID IN A COMPASSIONATE VOICE
'TIS A POOR IGNORANT LAD AND MAYHAP WAS DRIVEN HARD BY HUNGER FOR
THESE BE GRIEVOUS TIMES FOR THE UNFORTUNATE MARK YOU HE HATH NOT AN
EVIL FACE BUT WHEN HUNGER DRIVETH GOOD WOMAN DOST KNOW THAT WHEN ONE
STEALS A THING ABOVE THE VALUE OF THIRTEENPENCE HA'PENNY THE LAW SAITH
HE SHALL HANG FOR IT
THE LITTLE KING STARTED WIDE EYED WITH CONSTERNATION BUT CONTROLLED
HIMSELF AND HELD HIS PEACE BUT NOT SO THE WOMAN
SHE SPRANG TO HER
FEET SHAKING WITH FRIGHT AND CRIED OUT
OH GOOD LACK WHAT HAVE I DONE GOD A MERCY I WOULD NOT HANG
THE POOR THING FOR THE WHOLE WORLD AH SAVE ME FROM THIS YOUR
WORSHIP WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT CAN I DO
THE JUSTICE MAINTAINED HIS JUDICIAL COMPOSURE AND SIMPLY SAID
DOUBTLESS IT IS ALLOWABLE TO REVISE THE VALUE SINCE IT IS NOT YET WRIT
UPON THE RECORD
THEN IN GOD'S NAME CALL THE PIG EIGHTPENCE AND HEAVEN BLESS THE DAY
THAT FREED MY CONSCIENCE OF THIS AWESOME THING
MILES HENDON FORGOT ALL DECORUM IN HIS DELIGHT AND SURPRISED THE KING
AND WOUNDED HIS DIGNITY BY THROWING HIS ARMS AROUND HIM AND HUGGING
HIM
THE WOMAN MADE HER GRATEFUL ADIEUX AND STARTED AWAY WITH HER PIG
AND WHEN THE CONSTABLE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HER HE FOLLOWED HER OUT INTO
THE NARROW HALL
THE JUSTICE PROCEEDED TO WRITE IN HIS RECORD BOOK
HENDON ALWAYS ALERT THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THE OFFICER
FOLLOWED THE WOMAN OUT SO HE SLIPPED SOFTLY INTO THE DUSKY HALL AND
LISTENED
HE HEARD A CONVERSATION TO THIS EFFECT
IT IS A FAT PIG AND PROMISES GOOD EATING I WILL BUY IT OF THEE HERE
IS THE EIGHTPENCE
EIGHTPENCE INDEED THOU'LT DO NO SUCH THING
IT COST ME THREE
SHILLINGS AND EIGHTPENCE GOOD HONEST COIN OF THE LAST REIGN THAT OLD
HARRY THAT'S JUST DEAD NE'ER TOUCHED OR TAMPERED WITH
A FIG FOR THY
EIGHTPENCE
STANDS THE WIND IN THAT QUARTER THOU WAST UNDER OATH AND SO SWORE
FALSELY WHEN THOU SAIDST THE VALUE WAS BUT EIGHTPENCE
COME STRAIGHTWAY
BACK WITH ME BEFORE HIS WORSHIP AND ANSWER FOR THE CRIME AND THEN THE
LAD WILL HANG
THERE THERE DEAR HEART SAY NO MORE I AM CONTENT
GIVE ME THE
EIGHTPENCE AND HOLD THY PEACE ABOUT THE MATTER
THE WOMAN WENT OFF CRYING HENDON SLIPPED BACK INTO THE COURT ROOM
AND THE CONSTABLE PRESENTLY FOLLOWED AFTER HIDING HIS PRIZE IN SOME
CONVENIENT PLACE
THE JUSTICE WROTE A WHILE LONGER THEN READ THE KING
A WISE AND KINDLY LECTURE AND SENTENCED HIM TO A SHORT IMPRISONMENT
IN THE COMMON JAIL TO BE FOLLOWED BY A PUBLIC FLOGGING
THE ASTOUNDED
KING OPENED HIS MOUTH AND WAS PROBABLY GOING TO ORDER THE GOOD JUDGE TO
BE BEHEADED ON THE SPOT BUT HE CAUGHT A WARNING SIGN FROM HENDON AND
SUCCEEDED IN CLOSING HIS MOUTH AGAIN BEFORE HE LOST ANYTHING OUT OF IT
HENDON TOOK HIM BY THE HAND NOW MADE REVERENCE TO THE JUSTICE AND THE
TWO DEPARTED IN THE WAKE OF THE CONSTABLE TOWARD THE JAIL
THE MOMENT
THE STREET WAS REACHED THE INFLAMED MONARCH HALTED SNATCHED AWAY HIS
HAND AND EXCLAIMED
IDIOT DOST IMAGINE I WILL ENTER A COMMON JAIL ALIVE
HENDON BENT DOWN AND SAID SOMEWHAT SHARPLY
WILL YOU TRUST IN ME PEACE AND FORBEAR TO WORSEN OUR CHANCES WITH
DANGEROUS SPEECH
WHAT GOD WILLS WILL HAPPEN THOU CANST NOT HURRY IT
THOU CANST NOT ALTER IT THEREFORE WAIT AND BE PATIENT 'TWILL BE TIME
ENOW TO RAIL OR REJOICE WHEN WHAT IS TO HAPPEN HAS HAPPENED 1
CHAPTER XXIV
THE ESCAPE
THE SHORT WINTER DAY WAS NEARLY ENDED
THE STREETS WERE DESERTED SAVE
FOR A FEW RANDOM STRAGGLERS AND THESE HURRIED STRAIGHT ALONG WITH THE
INTENT LOOK OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ONLY ANXIOUS TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR ERRANDS
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN SNUGLY HOUSE THEMSELVES FROM THE RISING
WIND AND THE GATHERING TWILIGHT
THEY LOOKED NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO
THE LEFT THEY PAID NO ATTENTION TO OUR PARTY THEY DID NOT EVEN SEEM
TO SEE THEM
EDWARD THE SIXTH WONDERED IF THE SPECTACLE OF A KING ON HIS
WAY TO JAIL HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED SUCH MARVELLOUS INDIFFERENCE BEFORE
BY AND BY THE CONSTABLE ARRIVED AT A DESERTED MARKET SQUARE AND
PROCEEDED TO CROSS IT
WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE MIDDLE OF IT HENDON
LAID HIS HAND UPON HIS ARM AND SAID IN A LOW VOICE
BIDE A MOMENT GOOD SIR THERE IS NONE IN HEARING AND I WOULD SAY A
WORD TO THEE
MY DUTY FORBIDS IT SIR PRITHEE HINDER ME NOT THE NIGHT COMES ON

TURN THY BACK
A MOMENT AND SEEM NOT TO SEE LET THIS POOR LAD ESCAPE
THIS TO ME SIR I ARREST THEE IN
NAY BE NOT TOO HASTY
SEE THOU BE CAREFUL AND COMMIT NO FOOLISH
ERROR THEN HE SHUT HIS VOICE DOWN TO A WHISPER AND SAID IN THE MAN'S
EAR THE PIG THOU HAST PURCHASED FOR EIGHTPENCE MAY COST THEE THY NECK
MAN
THE POOR CONSTABLE TAKEN BY SURPRISE WAS SPEECHLESS AT FIRST THEN
FOUND HIS TONGUE AND FELL TO BLUSTERING AND THREATENING BUT HENDON
WAS TRANQUIL AND WAITED WITH PATIENCE TILL HIS BREATH WAS SPENT THEN
SAID
I HAVE A LIKING TO THEE FRIEND AND WOULD NOT WILLINGLY SEE THEE
COME TO HARM
OBSERVE I HEARD IT ALL EVERY WORD
I WILL PROVE IT TO
THEE THEN HE REPEATED THE CONVERSATION WHICH THE OFFICER AND THE WOMAN
HAD HAD TOGETHER IN THE HALL WORD FOR WORD AND ENDED WITH
THERE HAVE I SET IT FORTH CORRECTLY SHOULD NOT I BE ABLE TO SET IT
FORTH CORRECTLY BEFORE THE JUDGE IF OCCASION REQUIRED
THE MAN WAS DUMB WITH FEAR AND DISTRESS FOR A MOMENT THEN HE RALLIED
AND SAID WITH FORCED LIGHTNESS
'TIS MAKING A MIGHTY MATTER INDEED OUT OF A JEST I BUT PLAGUED THE
WOMAN FOR MINE AMUSEMENT
KEPT YOU THE WOMAN'S PIG FOR AMUSEMENT
THE MAN ANSWERED SHARPLY
NOUGHT ELSE GOOD SIR I TELL THEE 'TWAS BUT A JEST
I DO BEGIN TO BELIEVE THEE SAID HENDON WITH A PERPLEXING MIXTURE OF
MOCKERY AND HALF CONVICTION IN HIS TONE BUT TARRY THOU HERE A
MOMENT WHILST I RUN AND ASK HIS WORSHIP FOR NATHLESS HE BEING A MAN
EXPERIENCED IN LAW IN JESTS IN

AH BE
REASONABLE GOOD SIR ONLY LOOK AT THIS MATTER ON ALL ITS SIDES AND
SEE HOW MERE A JEST IT IS HOW MANIFESTLY AND HOW PLAINLY IT IS SO
AND
EVEN IF ONE GRANTED IT WERE NOT A JEST IT IS A FAULT SO SMALL THAT
E'EN THE GRIMMEST PENALTY IT COULD CALL FORTH WOULD BE BUT A REBUKE AND
WARNING FROM THE JUDGE'S LIPS
HENDON REPLIED WITH A SOLEMNITY WHICH CHILLED THE AIR ABOUT HIM

CHAPTER XXV
HENDON HALL
AS SOON AS HENDON AND THE KING WERE OUT OF SIGHT OF THE CONSTABLE HIS
MAJESTY WAS INSTRUCTED TO HURRY TO A CERTAIN PLACE OUTSIDE THE TOWN AND
WAIT THERE WHILST HENDON SHOULD GO TO THE INN AND SETTLE HIS ACCOUNT
HALF AN HOUR LATER THE TWO FRIENDS WERE BLITHELY JOGGING EASTWARD ON
HENDON'S SORRY STEEDS
THE KING WAS WARM AND COMFORTABLE NOW FOR
HE HAD CAST HIS RAGS AND CLOTHED HIMSELF IN THE SECOND HAND SUIT WHICH
HENDON HAD BOUGHT ON LONDON BRIDGE
HENDON WISHED TO GUARD AGAINST OVER FATIGUING THE BOY HE JUDGED THAT
HARD JOURNEYS IRREGULAR MEALS AND ILLIBERAL MEASURES OF SLEEP WOULD BE
BAD FOR HIS CRAZED MIND WHILST REST REGULARITY AND MODERATE EXERCISE
WOULD BE PRETTY SURE TO HASTEN ITS CURE HE LONGED TO SEE THE STRICKEN
INTELLECT MADE WELL AGAIN AND ITS DISEASED VISIONS DRIVEN OUT OF THE
TORMENTED LITTLE HEAD THEREFORE HE RESOLVED TO MOVE BY EASY STAGES
TOWARD THE HOME WHENCE HE HAD SO LONG BEEN BANISHED INSTEAD OF OBEYING
THE IMPULSE OF HIS IMPATIENCE AND HURRYING ALONG NIGHT AND DAY
WHEN HE AND THE KING HAD JOURNEYED ABOUT TEN MILES THEY REACHED A
CONSIDERABLE VILLAGE AND HALTED THERE FOR THE NIGHT AT A GOOD INN
THE FORMER RELATIONS WERE RESUMED HENDON STOOD BEHIND THE KING'S
CHAIR WHILE HE DINED AND WAITED UPON HIM UNDRESSED HIM WHEN HE WAS
READY FOR BED THEN TOOK THE FLOOR FOR HIS OWN QUARTERS AND SLEPT
ATHWART THE DOOR ROLLED UP IN A BLANKET
THE NEXT DAY AND THE DAY AFTER THEY JOGGED LAZILY ALONG TALKING
OVER THE ADVENTURES THEY HAD MET SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AND MIGHTILY
ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S NARRATIVES
HENDON DETAILED ALL HIS WIDE
WANDERINGS IN SEARCH OF THE KING AND DESCRIBED HOW THE ARCHANGEL HAD
LED HIM A FOOL'S JOURNEY ALL OVER THE FOREST AND TAKEN HIM BACK TO
THE HUT FINALLY WHEN HE FOUND HE COULD NOT GET RID OF HIM
THEN HE
SAID THE OLD MAN WENT INTO THE BEDCHAMBER AND CAME STAGGERING BACK
LOOKING BROKEN HEARTED AND SAYING HE HAD EXPECTED TO FIND THAT THE BOY
HAD RETURNED AND LAID DOWN IN THERE TO REST BUT IT WAS NOT SO
HENDON
HAD WAITED AT THE HUT ALL DAY HOPE OF THE KING'S RETURN DIED OUT THEN
AND HE DEPARTED UPON THE QUEST AGAIN
AND OLD SANCTUM SANCTORUM WAS TRULY SORRY YOUR HIGHNESS CAME NOT
BACK SAID HENDON I SAW IT IN HIS FACE
MARRY I WILL NEVER DOUBT THAT SAID THE KING AND THEN TOLD HIS OWN
STORY AFTER WHICH HENDON WAS SORRY HE HAD NOT DESTROYED THE ARCHANGEL
DURING THE LAST DAY OF THE TRIP HENDON'S SPIRITS WERE SOARING
HIS
TONGUE RAN CONSTANTLY
HE TALKED ABOUT HIS OLD FATHER AND HIS BROTHER
ARTHUR AND TOLD OF MANY THINGS WHICH ILLUSTRATED THEIR HIGH AND
GENEROUS CHARACTERS HE WENT INTO LOVING FRENZIES OVER HIS EDITH
AND WAS SO GLAD HEARTED THAT HE WAS EVEN ABLE TO SAY SOME GENTLE AND
BROTHERLY THINGS ABOUT HUGH
HE DWELT A DEAL ON THE COMING MEETING
AT HENDON HALL WHAT A SURPRISE IT WOULD BE TO EVERYBODY AND WHAT AN
OUTBURST OF THANKSGIVING AND DELIGHT THERE WOULD BE
IT WAS A FAIR REGION DOTTED WITH COTTAGES AND ORCHARDS AND THE ROAD
LED THROUGH BROAD PASTURE LANDS WHOSE RECEDING EXPANSES MARKED WITH
GENTLE ELEVATIONS AND DEPRESSIONS SUGGESTED THE SWELLING AND SUBSIDING
UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA
IN THE AFTERNOON THE RETURNING PRODIGAL MADE
CONSTANT DEFLECTIONS FROM HIS COURSE TO SEE IF BY ASCENDING SOME HILLOCK
HE MIGHT NOT PIERCE THE DISTANCE AND CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIS HOME
AT
LAST HE WAS SUCCESSFUL AND CRIED OUT EXCITEDLY
THERE IS THE VILLAGE MY PRINCE AND THERE IS THE HALL CLOSE BY YOU
MAY SEE THE TOWERS FROM HERE AND THAT WOOD THERE THAT IS MY FATHER'S
PARK
AH NOW THOU'LT KNOW WHAT STATE AND GRANDEUR BE A HOUSE WITH
SEVENTY ROOMS THINK OF THAT AND SEVEN AND TWENTY SERVANTS A BRAVE
LODGING FOR SUCH AS WE IS IT NOT SO COME LET US SPEED MY IMPATIENCE
WILL NOT BROOK FURTHER DELAY
ALL POSSIBLE HURRY WAS MADE STILL IT WAS AFTER THREE O'CLOCK BEFORE
THE VILLAGE WAS REACHED
THE TRAVELLERS SCAMPERED THROUGH IT HENDON'S
TONGUE GOING ALL THE TIME

IVY NONE GONE NONE ADDED YONDER IS THE INN THE OLD RED LION AND
YONDER IS THE MARKET PLACE HERE IS THE MAYPOLE AND HERE THE
PUMP NOTHING IS ALTERED NOTHING BUT THE PEOPLE AT ANY RATE TEN YEARS
MAKE A CHANGE IN PEOPLE SOME OF THESE I SEEM TO KNOW BUT NONE KNOW
ME SO HIS CHAT RAN ON
THE END OF THE VILLAGE WAS SOON REACHED THEN
THE TRAVELLERS STRUCK INTO A CROOKED NARROW ROAD WALLED IN WITH TALL
HEDGES AND HURRIED BRISKLY ALONG IT FOR HALF A MILE THEN PASSED INTO A
VAST FLOWER GARDEN THROUGH AN IMPOSING GATEWAY WHOSE HUGE STONE PILLARS
BORE SCULPTURED ARMORIAL DEVICES
A NOBLE MANSION WAS BEFORE THEM
WELCOME TO HENDON HALL MY KING EXCLAIMED MILES
AH 'TIS A GREAT
DAY MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER AND THE LADY EDITH WILL BE SO MAD WITH
JOY THAT THEY WILL HAVE EYES AND TONGUE FOR NONE BUT ME IN THE FIRST
TRANSPORTS OF THE MEETING AND SO THOU'LT SEEM BUT COLDLY WELCOMED BUT

WARD AND TELL THEM HOW COSTLY IS MY LOVE FOR THEE THOU'LT SEE THEM
TAKE THEE TO THEIR BREASTS FOR MILES HENDON'S SAKE AND MAKE THEIR HOUSE

THE NEXT MOMENT HENDON SPRANG TO THE GROUND BEFORE THE GREAT DOOR
HELPED THE KING DOWN THEN TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND RUSHED WITHIN
A FEW
STEPS BROUGHT HIM TO A SPACIOUS APARTMENT HE ENTERED SEATED THE KING
WITH MORE HURRY THAN CEREMONY THEN RAN TOWARD A YOUNG MAN WHO SAT AT A
WRITING TABLE IN FRONT OF A GENEROUS FIRE OF LOGS
EMBRACE ME HUGH HE CRIED AND SAY THOU'RT GLAD I AM COME AGAIN AND
CALL OUR FATHER FOR HOME IS NOT HOME TILL I SHALL TOUCH HIS HAND AND
SEE HIS FACE AND HEAR HIS VOICE ONCE MORE
BUT HUGH ONLY DREW BACK AFTER BETRAYING A MOMENTARY SURPRISE AND BENT
A GRAVE STARE UPON THE INTRUDER A STARE WHICH INDICATED SOMEWHAT OF
OFFENDED DIGNITY AT FIRST THEN CHANGED IN RESPONSE TO SOME INWARD
THOUGHT OR PURPOSE TO AN EXPRESSION OF MARVELLING CURIOSITY MIXED WITH
A REAL OR ASSUMED COMPASSION
PRESENTLY HE SAID IN A MILD VOICE
THY WITS SEEM TOUCHED POOR STRANGER DOUBTLESS THOU HAST SUFFERED
PRIVATIONS AND RUDE BUFFETINGS AT THE WORLD'S HANDS THY LOOKS AND DRESS

THE OTHER CONTINUED IN THE SAME SOFT TONE
AND WHOM DOST THOU IMAGINE THYSELF TO BE
IMAGINATION HATH NOUGHT TO DO WITH IT DOST THOU PRETEND THOU KNOWEST
ME NOT FOR THY BROTHER MILES HENDON
AN EXPRESSION OF PLEASED SURPRISE FLITTED ACROSS HUGH'S FACE AND HE
EXCLAIMED

CRUEL YEARS AH IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE

THE LIGHT LET ME SCAN THEE WELL
HE SEIZED MILES BY THE ARM DRAGGED HIM TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO
DEVOUR HIM FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH HIS EYES TURNING HIM THIS WAY AND
THAT AND STEPPING BRISKLY AROUND HIM AND ABOUT HIM TO PROVE HIM
FROM ALL POINTS OF VIEW WHILST THE RETURNED PRODIGAL ALL AGLOW WITH
GLADNESS SMILED LAUGHED AND KEPT NODDING HIS HEAD AND SAYING

IN DISSENT THEN DROPPED HIS CHIN MOURNFULLY UPON HIS BREAST SAYING
WITH EMOTION
AH GOD OF HIS MERCY GIVE ME STRENGTH TO BEAR THIS GRIEVOUS
DISAPPOINTMENT
MILES AMAZED COULD NOT SPEAK FOR A MOMENT THEN HE FOUND HIS TONGUE
AND CRIED OUT
WHAT DISAPPOINTMENT AM I NOT THY BROTHER
HUGH SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY AND SAID
I PRAY HEAVEN IT MAY PROVE SO AND THAT OTHER EYES MAY FIND THE
RESEMBLANCES THAT ARE HID FROM MINE
ALACK I FEAR ME THE LETTER SPOKE

HE CONTINUED WALKING BACK AND FORTH MUTTERING TO HIMSELF HE HAD

I DO NOT DOUBT THEE SAID THE KING WITH A CHILDLIKE SIMPLICITY AND
FAITH
I THANK THEE OUT OF MY HEART EXCLAIMED HENDON WITH A FERVENCY WHICH
SHOWED THAT HE WAS TOUCHED
THE KING ADDED WITH THE SAME GENTLE
SIMPLICITY
DOST THOU DOUBT ME
A GUILTY CONFUSION SEIZED UPON HENDON AND HE WAS GRATEFUL THAT THE DOOR
OPENED TO ADMIT HUGH AT THAT MOMENT AND SAVED HIM THE NECESSITY OF
REPLYING
A BEAUTIFUL LADY RICHLY CLOTHED FOLLOWED HUGH AND AFTER HER CAME
SEVERAL LIVERIED SERVANTS
THE LADY WALKED SLOWLY WITH HER HEAD BOWED
AND HER EYES FIXED UPON THE FLOOR
THE FACE WAS UNSPEAKABLY SAD
MILES
HENDON SPRANG FORWARD CRYING OUT
OH MY EDITH MY DARLING
BUT HUGH WAVED HIM BACK GRAVELY AND SAID TO THE LADY
LOOK UPON HIM
DO YOU KNOW HIM
AT THE SOUND OF MILES'S VOICE THE WOMAN HAD STARTED SLIGHTLY AND HER
CHEEKS HAD FLUSHED SHE WAS TREMBLING NOW
SHE STOOD STILL DURING AN
IMPRESSIVE PAUSE OF SEVERAL MOMENTS THEN SLOWLY LIFTED UP HER HEAD AND
LOOKED INTO HENDON'S EYES WITH A STONY AND FRIGHTENED GAZE THE BLOOD
SANK OUT OF HER FACE DROP BY DROP TILL NOTHING REMAINED BUT THE GREY
PALLOR OF DEATH THEN SHE SAID IN A VOICE AS DEAD AS THE FACE I KNOW
HIM NOT AND TURNED WITH A MOAN AND A STIFLED SOB AND TOTTERED OUT OF
THE ROOM
MILES HENDON SANK INTO A CHAIR AND COVERED HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS
AFTER A PAUSE HIS BROTHER SAID TO THE SERVANTS
YOU HAVE OBSERVED HIM
DO YOU KNOW HIM
THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS THEN THE MASTER SAID
THE SERVANTS KNOW YOU NOT SIR
I FEAR THERE IS SOME MISTAKE
YOU HAVE
SEEN THAT MY WIFE KNEW YOU NOT
THY WIFE IN AN INSTANT HUGH WAS PINNED TO THE WALL WITH AN IRON
GRIP ABOUT HIS THROAT
OH THOU FOX HEARTED SLAVE I SEE IT ALL
THOU'ST WRIT THE LYING LETTER THYSELF AND MY STOLEN BRIDE AND GOODS
ARE ITS FRUIT
THERE NOW GET THEE GONE LEST I SHAME MINE HONOURABLE
SOLDIERSHIP WITH THE SLAYING OF SO PITIFUL A MANNIKIN
HUGH RED FACED AND ALMOST SUFFOCATED REELED TO THE NEAREST CHAIR AND
COMMANDED THE SERVANTS TO SEIZE AND BIND THE MURDEROUS STRANGER
THEY
HESITATED AND ONE OF THEM SAID
HE IS ARMED SIR HUGH AND WE ARE WEAPONLESS
ARMED WHAT OF IT AND YE SO MANY UPON HIM I SAY
BUT MILES WARNED THEM TO BE CAREFUL WHAT THEY DID AND ADDED
YE KNOW ME OF OLD I HAVE NOT CHANGED COME ON AN' IT LIKE YOU
THIS REMINDER DID NOT HEARTEN THE SERVANTS MUCH THEY STILL HELD BACK
THEN GO YE PALTRY COWARDS AND ARM YOURSELVES AND GUARD THE DOORS
WHILST I SEND ONE TO FETCH THE WATCH SAID HUGH
HE TURNED AT THE
THRESHOLD AND SAID TO MILES YOU'LL FIND IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE TO
OFFEND NOT WITH USELESS ENDEAVOURS AT ESCAPE
ESCAPE SPARE THYSELF DISCOMFORT AN' THAT IS ALL THAT TROUBLES THEE
FOR MILES HENDON IS MASTER OF HENDON HALL AND ALL ITS BELONGINGS
HE
WILL REMAIN DOUBT IT NOT
CHAPTER XXVI
DISOWNED
THE KING SAT MUSING A FEW MOMENTS THEN LOOKED UP AND SAID
'TIS STRANGE MOST STRANGE
I CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR IT
NO IT IS NOT STRANGE MY LIEGE
I KNOW HIM AND THIS CONDUCT IS BUT
NATURAL
HE WAS A RASCAL FROM HIS BIRTH
OH I SPAKE NOT OF HIM SIR MILES
NOT OF HIM THEN OF WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT IS STRANGE
THAT THE KING IS NOT MISSED
HOW WHICH I DOUBT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
INDEED DOTH IT NOT STRIKE YOU AS BEING PASSING STRANGE THAT THE LAND
IS NOT FILLED WITH COURIERS AND PROCLAMATIONS DESCRIBING MY PERSON AND
MAKING SEARCH FOR ME IS IT NO MATTER FOR COMMOTION AND DISTRESS THAT
THE HEAD OF THE STATE IS GONE THAT I AM VANISHED AWAY AND LOST
MOST TRUE MY KING I HAD FORGOT THEN HENDON SIGHED AND MUTTERED TO
HIMSELF POOR RUINED MIND STILL BUSY WITH ITS PATHETIC DREAM
BUT I HAVE A PLAN THAT SHALL RIGHT US BOTH I WILL WRITE A PAPER IN
THREE TONGUES LATIN GREEK AND ENGLISH AND THOU SHALT HASTE AWAY WITH
IT TO LONDON IN THE MORNING
GIVE IT TO NONE BUT MY UNCLE THE LORD
HERTFORD WHEN HE SHALL SEE IT HE WILL KNOW AND SAY I WROTE IT
THEN
HE WILL SEND FOR ME
MIGHT IT NOT BE BEST MY PRINCE THAT WE WAIT HERE UNTIL I PROVE MYSELF
AND MAKE MY RIGHTS SECURE TO MY DOMAINS I SHOULD BE SO MUCH THE BETTER
ABLE THEN TO
THE KING INTERRUPTED HIM IMPERIOUSLY
PEACE WHAT ARE THY PALTRY DOMAINS THY TRIVIAL INTERESTS CONTRASTED
WITH MATTERS WHICH CONCERN THE WEAL OF A NATION AND THE INTEGRITY OF A
THRONE THEN HE ADDED IN A GENTLE VOICE AS IF HE WERE SORRY FOR HIS
SEVERITY OBEY AND HAVE NO FEAR I WILL RIGHT THEE I WILL MAKE THEE
WHOLE YES MORE THAN WHOLE
I SHALL REMEMBER AND REQUITE
SO SAYING HE TOOK THE PEN AND SET HIMSELF TO WORK
HENDON
CONTEMPLATED HIM LOVINGLY A WHILE THEN SAID TO HIMSELF
AN' IT WERE DARK I SHOULD THINK IT WAS A KING THAT SPOKE THERE'S
NO DENYING IT WHEN THE HUMOUR'S UPON ON HIM HE DOTH THUNDER AND LIGHTEN
LIKE YOUR TRUE KING NOW WHERE GOT HE THAT TRICK SEE HIM SCRIBBLE AND
SCRATCH AWAY CONTENTEDLY AT HIS MEANINGLESS POT HOOKS FANCYING THEM TO
BE LATIN AND GREEK AND EXCEPT MY WIT SHALL SERVE ME WITH A LUCKY DEVICE
FOR DIVERTING HIM FROM HIS PURPOSE I SHALL BE FORCED TO PRETEND TO POST
AWAY TO MORROW ON THIS WILD ERRAND HE HATH INVENTED FOR ME
THE NEXT MOMENT SIR MILES'S THOUGHTS HAD GONE BACK TO THE RECENT
EPISODE
SO ABSORBED WAS HE IN HIS MUSINGS THAT WHEN THE KING PRESENTLY
HANDED HIM THE PAPER WHICH HE HAD BEEN WRITING HE RECEIVED IT AND
POCKETED IT WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE ACT
HOW MARVELLOUS STRANGE
SHE ACTED HE MUTTERED
I THINK SHE KNEW ME AND I THINK SHE DID
NOT KNOW ME
THESE OPINIONS DO CONFLICT I PERCEIVE IT PLAINLY I
CANNOT RECONCILE THEM NEITHER CAN I BY ARGUMENT DISMISS EITHER OF THE
TWO OR EVEN PERSUADE ONE TO OUTWEIGH THE OTHER
THE MATTER STANDETH
SIMPLY THUS SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN MY FACE MY FIGURE MY VOICE FOR HOW
COULD IT BE OTHERWISE YET SHE SAID SHE KNEW ME NOT AND THAT IS
PROOF PERFECT FOR SHE CANNOT LIE
BUT STOP I THINK I BEGIN TO SEE
PERADVENTURE HE HATH INFLUENCED HER COMMANDED HER COMPELLED HER TO
LIE
THAT IS THE SOLUTION
THE RIDDLE IS UNRIDDLED
SHE SEEMED DEAD
WITH FEAR YES SHE WAS UNDER HIS COMPULSION
I WILL SEEK HER I WILL
FIND HER NOW THAT HE IS AWAY SHE WILL SPEAK HER TRUE MIND
SHE WILL
REMEMBER THE OLD TIMES WHEN WE WERE LITTLE PLAYFELLOWS TOGETHER AND
THIS WILL SOFTEN HER HEART AND SHE WILL NO MORE BETRAY ME BUT WILL
CONFESS ME
THERE IS NO TREACHEROUS BLOOD IN HER NO SHE WAS ALWAYS
HONEST AND TRUE
SHE HAS LOVED ME IN THOSE OLD DAYS THIS IS MY
SECURITY FOR WHOM ONE HAS LOVED ONE CANNOT BETRAY
HE STEPPED EAGERLY TOWARD THE DOOR AT THAT MOMENT IT OPENED AND THE
LADY EDITH ENTERED
SHE WAS VERY PALE BUT SHE WALKED WITH A FIRM STEP
AND HER CARRIAGE WAS FULL OF GRACE AND GENTLE DIGNITY
HER FACE WAS AS
SAD AS BEFORE
MILES SPRANG FORWARD WITH A HAPPY CONFIDENCE TO MEET HER BUT SHE
CHECKED HIM WITH A HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE GESTURE AND HE STOPPED WHERE HE
WAS
SHE SEATED HERSELF AND ASKED HIM TO DO LIKEWISE
THUS SIMPLY DID
SHE TAKE THE SENSE OF OLD COMRADESHIP OUT OF HIM AND TRANSFORM HIM
INTO A STRANGER AND A GUEST
THE SURPRISE OF IT THE BEWILDERING
UNEXPECTEDNESS OF IT MADE HIM BEGIN TO QUESTION FOR A MOMENT IF HE
WAS THE PERSON HE WAS PRETENDING TO BE AFTER ALL
THE LADY EDITH
SAID
SIR I HAVE COME TO WARN YOU
THE MAD CANNOT BE PERSUADED OUT OF
THEIR DELUSIONS PERCHANCE BUT DOUBTLESS THEY MAY BE PERSUADED TO AVOID
PERILS
I THINK THIS DREAM OF YOURS HATH THE SEEMING OF HONEST TRUTH TO
YOU AND THEREFORE IS NOT CRIMINAL BUT DO NOT TARRY HERE WITH IT FOR
HERE IT IS DANGEROUS SHE LOOKED STEADILY INTO MILES'S FACE A MOMENT
THEN ADDED IMPRESSIVELY IT IS THE MORE DANGEROUS FOR THAT YOU ARE
MUCH LIKE WHAT OUR LOST LAD MUST HAVE GROWN TO BE IF HE HAD LIVED
HEAVENS MADAM BUT I AM HE
I TRULY THINK YOU THINK IT SIR
I QUESTION NOT YOUR HONESTY IN THAT
I BUT WARN YOU THAT IS ALL
MY HUSBAND IS MASTER IN THIS REGION HIS
POWER HATH HARDLY ANY LIMIT THE PEOPLE PROSPER OR STARVE AS HE WILLS
IF YOU RESEMBLED NOT THE MAN WHOM YOU PROFESS TO BE MY HUSBAND MIGHT
BID YOU PLEASURE YOURSELF WITH YOUR DREAM IN PEACE BUT TRUST ME I KNOW
HIM WELL I KNOW WHAT HE WILL DO HE WILL SAY TO ALL THAT YOU ARE BUT A
MAD IMPOSTOR AND STRAIGHTWAY ALL WILL ECHO HIM SHE BENT UPON MILES
THAT SAME STEADY LOOK ONCE MORE AND ADDED IF YOU WERE MILES
HENDON AND HE KNEW IT AND ALL THE REGION KNEW IT CONSIDER WHAT I
AM SAYING WEIGH IT WELL YOU WOULD STAND IN THE SAME PERIL YOUR
PUNISHMENT WOULD BE NO LESS SURE HE WOULD DENY YOU AND DENOUNCE YOU
AND NONE WOULD BE BOLD ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU COUNTENANCE
MOST TRULY I BELIEVE IT SAID MILES BITTERLY
THE POWER THAT
CAN COMMAND ONE LIFE LONG FRIEND TO BETRAY AND DISOWN ANOTHER AND BE
OBEYED MAY WELL LOOK TO BE OBEYED IN QUARTERS WHERE BREAD AND LIFE ARE
ON THE STAKE AND NO COBWEB TIES OF LOYALTY AND HONOUR ARE CONCERNED
A FAINT TINGE APPEARED FOR A MOMENT IN THE LADY'S CHEEK AND SHE DROPPED
HER EYES TO THE FLOOR BUT HER VOICE BETRAYED NO EMOTION WHEN SHE
PROCEEDED
I HAVE WARNED YOU I MUST STILL WARN YOU TO GO HENCE
THIS MAN WILL
DESTROY YOU ELSE
HE IS A TYRANT WHO KNOWS NO PITY
I WHO AM
HIS FETTERED SLAVE KNOW THIS
POOR MILES AND ARTHUR AND MY DEAR
GUARDIAN SIR RICHARD ARE FREE OF HIM AND AT REST BETTER THAT
YOU WERE WITH THEM THAN THAT YOU BIDE HERE IN THE CLUTCHES OF THIS
MISCREANT
YOUR PRETENSIONS ARE A MENACE TO HIS TITLE AND POSSESSIONS
YOU HAVE ASSAULTED HIM IN HIS OWN HOUSE YOU ARE RUINED IF YOU STAY
GO DO NOT HESITATE
IF YOU LACK MONEY TAKE THIS PURSE I BEG OF YOU
AND BRIBE THE SERVANTS TO LET YOU PASS
OH BE WARNED POOR SOUL AND
ESCAPE WHILE YOU MAY
MILES DECLINED THE PURSE WITH A GESTURE AND ROSE UP AND STOOD BEFORE
HER
GRANT ME ONE THING HE SAID
LET YOUR EYES REST UPON MINE SO THAT I
MAY SEE IF THEY BE STEADY
THERE NOW ANSWER ME
AM I MILES HENDON
NO
I KNOW YOU NOT
SWEAR IT
THE ANSWER WAS LOW BUT DISTINCT
I SWEAR
OH THIS PASSES BELIEF
FLY WHY WILL YOU WASTE THE PRECIOUS TIME FLY AND SAVE YOURSELF
AT THAT MOMENT THE OFFICERS BURST INTO THE ROOM AND A VIOLENT STRUGGLE
BEGAN BUT HENDON WAS SOON OVERPOWERED AND DRAGGED AWAY
THE KING WAS
TAKEN ALSO AND BOTH WERE BOUND AND LED TO PRISON
CHAPTER XXVII
IN PRISON
THE CELLS WERE ALL CROWDED SO THE TWO FRIENDS WERE CHAINED IN A LARGE
ROOM WHERE PERSONS CHARGED WITH TRIFLING OFFENCES WERE COMMONLY KEPT
THEY HAD COMPANY FOR THERE WERE SOME TWENTY MANACLED AND FETTERED
PRISONERS HERE OF BOTH SEXES AND OF VARYING AGES AN OBSCENE AND NOISY
GANG
THE KING CHAFED BITTERLY OVER THE STUPENDOUS INDIGNITY THUS PUT
UPON HIS ROYALTY BUT HENDON WAS MOODY AND TACITURN
HE WAS PRETTY
THOROUGHLY BEWILDERED HE HAD COME HOME A JUBILANT PRODIGAL EXPECTING
TO FIND EVERYBODY WILD WITH JOY OVER HIS RETURN AND INSTEAD HAD GOT THE
COLD SHOULDER AND A JAIL
THE PROMISE AND THE FULFILMENT DIFFERED SO
WIDELY THAT THE EFFECT WAS STUNNING HE COULD NOT DECIDE WHETHER IT
WAS MOST TRAGIC OR MOST GROTESQUE
HE FELT MUCH AS A MAN MIGHT WHO HAD
DANCED BLITHELY OUT TO ENJOY A RAINBOW AND GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
BUT GRADUALLY HIS CONFUSED AND TORMENTING THOUGHTS SETTLED DOWN INTO
SOME SORT OF ORDER AND THEN HIS MIND CENTRED ITSELF UPON EDITH
HE
TURNED HER CONDUCT OVER AND EXAMINED IT IN ALL LIGHTS BUT HE COULD NOT
MAKE ANYTHING SATISFACTORY OUT OF IT
DID SHE KNOW HIM OR DIDN'T SHE
KNOW HIM IT WAS A PERPLEXING PUZZLE AND OCCUPIED HIM A LONG TIME BUT
HE ENDED FINALLY WITH THE CONVICTION THAT SHE DID KNOW HIM AND HAD
REPUDIATED HIM FOR INTERESTED REASONS
HE WANTED TO LOAD HER NAME WITH
CURSES NOW BUT THIS NAME HAD SO LONG BEEN SACRED TO HIM THAT HE FOUND
HE COULD NOT BRING HIS TONGUE TO PROFANE IT
WRAPPED IN PRISON BLANKETS OF A SOILED AND TATTERED CONDITION HENDON
AND THE KING PASSED A TROUBLED NIGHT
FOR A BRIBE THE JAILER HAD
FURNISHED LIQUOR TO SOME OF THE PRISONERS SINGING OF RIBALD SONGS
FIGHTING SHOUTING AND CAROUSING WAS THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE
AT LAST
A WHILE AFTER MIDNIGHT A MAN ATTACKED A WOMAN AND NEARLY KILLED HER BY
BEATING HER OVER THE HEAD WITH HIS MANACLES BEFORE THE JAILER COULD
COME TO THE RESCUE
THE JAILER RESTORED PEACE BY GIVING THE MAN A SOUND
CLUBBING ABOUT THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS THEN THE CAROUSING CEASED
AND AFTER THAT ALL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SLEEP WHO DID NOT MIND THE
ANNOYANCE OF THE MOANINGS AND GROANINGS OF THE TWO WOUNDED PEOPLE
DURING THE ENSUING WEEK THE DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE OF A MONOTONOUS
SAMENESS AS TO EVENTS MEN WHOSE FACES HENDON REMEMBERED MORE OR LESS
DISTINCTLY CAME BY DAY TO GAZE AT THE 'IMPOSTOR' AND REPUDIATE
AND INSULT HIM AND BY NIGHT THE CAROUSING AND BRAWLING WENT ON WITH
SYMMETRICAL REGULARITY
HOWEVER THERE WAS A CHANGE OF INCIDENT AT
LAST
THE JAILER BROUGHT IN AN OLD MAN AND SAID TO HIM
THE VILLAIN IS IN THIS ROOM CAST THY OLD EYES ABOUT AND SEE IF THOU
CANST SAY WHICH IS HE
HENDON GLANCED UP AND EXPERIENCED A PLEASANT SENSATION FOR THE FIRST
TIME SINCE HE HAD BEEN IN THE JAIL
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THIS IS BLAKE
ANDREWS A SERVANT ALL HIS LIFE IN MY FATHER'S FAMILY A GOOD HONEST
SOUL WITH A RIGHT HEART IN HIS BREAST
THAT IS FORMERLY
BUT NONE ARE
TRUE NOW ALL ARE LIARS
THIS MAN WILL KNOW ME AND WILL DENY ME TOO
LIKE THE REST
THE OLD MAN GAZED AROUND THE ROOM GLANCED AT EACH FACE IN TURN AND
FINALLY SAID
I SEE NONE HERE BUT PALTRY KNAVES SCUM O' THE STREETS
WHICH IS HE
THE JAILER LAUGHED
HERE HE SAID SCAN THIS BIG ANIMAL AND GRANT ME AN OPINION
THE OLD MAN APPROACHED AND LOOKED HENDON OVER LONG AND EARNESTLY THEN
SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID
MARRY THIS IS NO HENDON NOR EVER WAS
RIGHT THY OLD EYES ARE SOUND YET
AN' I WERE SIR HUGH I WOULD TAKE
THE SHABBY CARLE AND
THE JAILER FINISHED BY LIFTING HIMSELF A TIP TOE WITH AN IMAGINARY
HALTER AT THE SAME TIME MAKING A GURGLING NOISE IN HIS THROAT
SUGGESTIVE OF SUFFOCATION
THE OLD MAN SAID VINDICTIVELY
LET HIM BLESS GOD AN' HE FARE NO WORSE
AN' I HAD THE HANDLING O'
THE VILLAIN HE SHOULD ROAST OR I AM NO TRUE MAN
THE JAILER LAUGHED A PLEASANT HYENA LAUGH AND SAID
GIVE HIM A PIECE OF THY MIND OLD MAN THEY ALL DO IT
THOU'LT FIND IT
GOOD DIVERSION
THEN HE SAUNTERED TOWARD HIS ANTE ROOM AND DISAPPEARED
THE OLD MAN
DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND WHISPERED
GOD BE THANKED THOU'RT COME AGAIN MY MASTER I BELIEVED THOU WERT
DEAD THESE SEVEN YEARS AND LO HERE THOU ART ALIVE I KNEW THEE THE
MOMENT I SAW THEE AND MAIN HARD WORK IT WAS TO KEEP A STONY COUNTENANCE
AND SEEM TO SEE NONE HERE BUT TUPPENNY KNAVES AND RUBBISH O' THE
STREETS
I AM OLD AND POOR SIR MILES BUT SAY THE WORD AND I WILL GO
FORTH AND PROCLAIM THE TRUTH THOUGH I BE STRANGLED FOR IT
NO SAID HENDON THOU SHALT NOT
IT WOULD RUIN THEE AND YET HELP
BUT LITTLE IN MY CAUSE
BUT I THANK THEE FOR THOU HAST GIVEN ME BACK
SOMEWHAT OF MY LOST FAITH IN MY KIND
THE OLD SERVANT BECAME VERY VALUABLE TO HENDON AND THE KING FOR
HE DROPPED IN SEVERAL TIMES A DAY TO 'ABUSE' THE FORMER AND ALWAYS
SMUGGLED IN A FEW DELICACIES TO HELP OUT THE PRISON BILL OF FARE HE
ALSO FURNISHED THE CURRENT NEWS
HENDON RESERVED THE DAINTIES FOR THE
KING WITHOUT THEM HIS MAJESTY MIGHT NOT HAVE SURVIVED FOR HE WAS
NOT ABLE TO EAT THE COARSE AND WRETCHED FOOD PROVIDED BY THE JAILER
ANDREWS WAS OBLIGED TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO BRIEF VISITS IN ORDER TO
AVOID SUSPICION BUT HE MANAGED TO IMPART A FAIR DEGREE OF INFORMATION
EACH TIME INFORMATION DELIVERED IN A LOW VOICE FOR HENDON'S BENEFIT
AND INTERLARDED WITH INSULTING EPITHETS DELIVERED IN A LOUDER VOICE FOR
THE BENEFIT OF OTHER HEARERS
SO LITTLE BY LITTLE THE STORY OF THE FAMILY CAME OUT
ARTHUR HAD
BEEN DEAD SIX YEARS
THIS LOSS WITH THE ABSENCE OF NEWS FROM HENDON
IMPAIRED THE FATHER'S HEALTH HE BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO DIE AND HE
WISHED TO SEE HUGH AND EDITH SETTLED IN LIFE BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY BUT
EDITH BEGGED HARD FOR DELAY HOPING FOR MILES'S RETURN THEN THE LETTER
CAME WHICH BROUGHT THE NEWS OF MILES'S DEATH THE SHOCK PROSTRATED SIR
RICHARD HE BELIEVED HIS END WAS VERY NEAR AND HE AND HUGH INSISTED
UPON THE MARRIAGE EDITH BEGGED FOR AND OBTAINED A MONTH'S RESPITE
THEN ANOTHER AND FINALLY A THIRD THE MARRIAGE THEN TOOK PLACE BY
THE DEATH BED OF SIR RICHARD
IT HAD NOT PROVED A HAPPY ONE
IT WAS
WHISPERED ABOUT THE COUNTRY THAT SHORTLY AFTER THE NUPTIALS THE BRIDE
FOUND AMONG HER HUSBAND'S PAPERS SEVERAL ROUGH AND INCOMPLETE DRAFTS OF
THE FATAL LETTER AND HAD ACCUSED HIM OF PRECIPITATING THE MARRIAGE AND
SIR RICHARD'S DEATH TOO BY A WICKED FORGERY
TALES OF CRUELTY TO THE
LADY EDITH AND THE SERVANTS WERE TO BE HEARD ON ALL HANDS AND SINCE THE
FATHER'S DEATH SIR HUGH HAD THROWN OFF ALL SOFT DISGUISES AND BECOME
A PITILESS MASTER TOWARD ALL WHO IN ANY WAY DEPENDED UPON HIM AND HIS
DOMAINS FOR BREAD
THERE WAS A BIT OF ANDREW'S GOSSIP WHICH THE KING LISTENED TO WITH A
LIVELY INTEREST
THERE IS RUMOUR THAT THE KING IS MAD
BUT IN CHARITY FORBEAR TO SAY
I MENTIONED IT FOR 'TIS DEATH TO SPEAK OF IT THEY SAY
HIS MAJESTY GLARED AT THE OLD MAN AND SAID
THE KING IS NOT MAD GOOD MAN AND THOU'LT FIND IT TO THY ADVANTAGE
TO BUSY THYSELF WITH MATTERS THAT NEARER CONCERN THEE THAN THIS
SEDITIOUS PRATTLE
WHAT DOTH THE LAD MEAN SAID ANDREWS SURPRISED AT THIS BRISK ASSAULT
FROM SUCH AN UNEXPECTED QUARTER
HENDON GAVE HIM A SIGN AND HE DID NOT
PURSUE HIS QUESTION BUT WENT ON WITH HIS BUDGET
THE LATE KING IS TO BE BURIED AT WINDSOR IN A DAY OR TWO THE 16TH OF
THE MONTH AND THE NEW KING WILL BE CROWNED AT WESTMINSTER THE 20TH
METHINKS THEY MUST NEEDS FIND HIM FIRST MUTTERED HIS MAJESTY THEN
ADDED CONFIDENTLY BUT THEY WILL LOOK TO THAT AND SO ALSO SHALL I
IN THE NAME OF
BUT THE OLD MAN GOT NO FURTHER A WARNING SIGN FROM HENDON CHECKED HIS
REMARK
HE RESUMED THE THREAD OF HIS GOSSIP
SIR HUGH GOETH TO THE CORONATION AND WITH GRAND HOPES
HE CONFIDENTLY
LOOKETH TO COME BACK A PEER FOR HE IS HIGH IN FAVOUR WITH THE LORD
PROTECTOR
WHAT LORD PROTECTOR ASKED HIS MAJESTY
HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF SOMERSET
WHAT DUKE OF SOMERSET
MARRY THERE IS BUT ONE SEYMOUR EARL OF HERTFORD
THE KING ASKED SHARPLY
SINCE WHEN IS HE A DUKE AND LORD PROTECTOR
SINCE THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY
AND PRITHEE WHO MADE HIM SO
HIMSELF AND THE GREAT COUNCIL WITH HELP OF THE KING
HIS MAJESTY STARTED VIOLENTLY
THE KING HE CRIED
WHAT KING
GOOD SIR
WHAT KING INDEED GOD A MERCY WHAT AILETH THE BOY SITH WE HAVE
BUT ONE 'TIS NOT DIFFICULT TO ANSWER HIS MOST SACRED MAJESTY KING
EDWARD THE SIXTH WHOM GOD PRESERVE YEA AND A DEAR AND GRACIOUS
LITTLE URCHIN IS HE TOO AND WHETHER HE BE MAD OR NO AND THEY SAY HE
MENDETH DAILY HIS PRAISES ARE ON ALL MEN'S LIPS AND ALL BLESS HIM
LIKEWISE AND OFFER PRAYERS THAT HE MAY BE SPARED TO REIGN LONG IN
ENGLAND FOR HE BEGAN HUMANELY WITH SAVING THE OLD DUKE OF NORFOLK'S
LIFE AND NOW IS HE BENT ON DESTROYING THE CRUELLEST OF THE LAWS THAT
HARRY AND OPPRESS THE PEOPLE
THIS NEWS STRUCK HIS MAJESTY DUMB WITH AMAZEMENT AND PLUNGED HIM INTO
SO DEEP AND DISMAL A REVERIE THAT HE HEARD NO MORE OF THE OLD MAN'S
GOSSIP
HE WONDERED IF THE 'LITTLE URCHIN' WAS THE BEGGAR BOY WHOM
HE LEFT DRESSED IN HIS OWN GARMENTS IN THE PALACE
IT DID NOT SEEM
POSSIBLE THAT THIS COULD BE FOR SURELY HIS MANNERS AND SPEECH WOULD
BETRAY HIM IF HE PRETENDED TO BE THE PRINCE OF WALES THEN HE WOULD BE
DRIVEN OUT AND SEARCH MADE FOR THE TRUE PRINCE
COULD IT BE THAT THE
COURT HAD SET UP SOME SPRIG OF THE NOBILITY IN HIS PLACE NO FOR HIS
UNCLE WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT HE WAS ALL POWERFUL AND COULD AND WOULD
CRUSH SUCH A MOVEMENT OF COURSE
THE BOY'S MUSINGS PROFITED HIM
NOTHING THE MORE HE TRIED TO UNRIDDLE THE MYSTERY THE MORE PERPLEXED HE
BECAME THE MORE HIS HEAD ACHED AND THE WORSE HE SLEPT
HIS
IMPATIENCE TO GET TO LONDON GREW HOURLY AND HIS CAPTIVITY BECAME ALMOST
UNENDURABLE
HENDON'S ARTS ALL FAILED WITH THE KING HE COULD NOT BE COMFORTED BUT A
COUPLE OF WOMEN WHO WERE CHAINED NEAR HIM SUCCEEDED BETTER
UNDER THEIR
GENTLE MINISTRATIONS HE FOUND PEACE AND LEARNED A DEGREE OF PATIENCE
HE WAS VERY GRATEFUL AND CAME TO LOVE THEM DEARLY AND TO DELIGHT IN
THE SWEET AND SOOTHING INFLUENCE OF THEIR PRESENCE
HE ASKED THEM WHY
THEY WERE IN PRISON AND WHEN THEY SAID THEY WERE BAPTISTS HE SMILED
AND INQUIRED
IS THAT A CRIME TO BE SHUT UP FOR IN A PRISON NOW I GRIEVE FOR I
SHALL LOSE YE THEY WILL NOT KEEP YE LONG FOR SUCH A LITTLE THING
THEY DID NOT ANSWER AND SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES MADE HIM UNEASY
HE
SAID EAGERLY
YOU DO NOT SPEAK BE GOOD TO ME AND TELL ME THERE WILL BE NO OTHER
PUNISHMENT PRITHEE TELL ME THERE IS NO FEAR OF THAT
THEY TRIED TO CHANGE THE TOPIC BUT HIS FEARS WERE AROUSED AND HE
PURSUED IT
WILL THEY SCOURGE THEE NO NO THEY WOULD NOT BE SO CRUEL SAY THEY
WOULD NOT
COME THEY WILL NOT WILL THEY
THE WOMEN BETRAYED CONFUSION AND DISTRESS BUT THERE WAS NO AVOIDING AN
ANSWER SO ONE OF THEM SAID IN A VOICE CHOKED WITH EMOTION
OH THOU'LT BREAK OUR HEARTS THOU GENTLE SPIRIT GOD WILL HELP US TO
BEAR OUR
IT IS A CONFESSION THE KING BROKE IN
THEN THEY WILL SCOURGE
THEE THE STONY HEARTED WRETCHES BUT OH THOU MUST NOT WEEP I CANNOT
BEAR IT
KEEP UP THY COURAGE I SHALL COME TO MY OWN IN TIME TO SAVE
THEE FROM THIS BITTER THING AND I WILL DO IT
WHEN THE KING AWOKE IN THE MORNING THE WOMEN WERE GONE
THEY ARE SAVED HE SAID JOYFULLY THEN ADDED DESPONDENTLY BUT WOE
IS ME FOR THEY WERE MY COMFORTERS
EACH OF THEM HAD LEFT A SHRED OF RIBBON PINNED TO HIS CLOTHING IN TOKEN
OF REMEMBRANCE
HE SAID HE WOULD KEEP THESE THINGS ALWAYS AND THAT
SOON HE WOULD SEEK OUT THESE DEAR GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND TAKE THEM
UNDER HIS PROTECTION
JUST THEN THE JAILER CAME IN WITH SOME SUBORDINATES AND COMMANDED THAT
THE PRISONERS BE CONDUCTED TO THE JAIL YARD
THE KING WAS OVERJOYED IT
WOULD BE A BLESSED THING TO SEE THE BLUE SKY AND BREATHE THE FRESH AIR
ONCE MORE
HE FRETTED AND CHAFED AT THE SLOWNESS OF THE OFFICERS BUT
HIS TURN CAME AT LAST AND HE WAS RELEASED FROM HIS STAPLE AND ORDERED
TO FOLLOW THE OTHER PRISONERS WITH HENDON
THE COURT OR QUADRANGLE WAS STONE PAVED AND OPEN TO THE SKY
THE
PRISONERS ENTERED IT THROUGH A MASSIVE ARCHWAY OF MASONRY AND WERE
PLACED IN FILE STANDING WITH THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE WALL
A ROPE
WAS STRETCHED IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY WERE ALSO GUARDED BY THEIR
OFFICERS
IT WAS A CHILL AND LOWERING MORNING AND A LIGHT SNOW WHICH
HAD FALLEN DURING THE NIGHT WHITENED THE GREAT EMPTY SPACE AND ADDED
TO THE GENERAL DISMALNESS OF ITS ASPECT
NOW AND THEN A WINTRY WIND
SHIVERED THROUGH THE PLACE AND SENT THE SNOW EDDYING HITHER AND THITHER
IN THE CENTRE OF THE COURT STOOD TWO WOMEN CHAINED TO POSTS
A GLANCE
SHOWED THE KING THAT THESE WERE HIS GOOD FRIENDS
HE SHUDDERED AND
SAID TO HIMSELF ALACK THEY ARE NOT GONE FREE AS I HAD THOUGHT
TO
THINK THAT SUCH AS THESE SHOULD KNOW THE LASH IN ENGLAND AY THERE'S
THE SHAME OF IT NOT IN HEATHENNESSE CHRISTIAN ENGLAND THEY WILL BE
SCOURGED AND I WHOM THEY HAVE COMFORTED AND KINDLY ENTREATED MUST
LOOK ON AND SEE THE GREAT WRONG DONE IT IS STRANGE SO STRANGE THAT
I THE VERY SOURCE OF POWER IN THIS BROAD REALM AM HELPLESS TO PROTECT
THEM
BUT LET THESE MISCREANTS LOOK WELL TO THEMSELVES FOR THERE IS A
DAY COMING WHEN I WILL REQUIRE OF THEM A HEAVY RECKONING FOR THIS WORK
FOR EVERY BLOW THEY STRIKE NOW THEY SHALL FEEL A HUNDRED THEN
A GREAT GATE SWUNG OPEN AND A CROWD OF CITIZENS POURED IN
THEY
FLOCKED AROUND THE TWO WOMEN AND HID THEM FROM THE KING'S VIEW
A
CLERGYMAN ENTERED AND PASSED THROUGH THE CROWD AND HE ALSO WAS HIDDEN
THE KING NOW HEARD TALKING BACK AND FORTH AS IF QUESTIONS WERE BEING
ASKED AND ANSWERED BUT HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT WAS SAID
NEXT THERE
WAS A DEAL OF BUSTLE AND PREPARATION AND MUCH PASSING AND REPASSING OF
OFFICIALS THROUGH THAT PART OF THE CROWD THAT STOOD ON THE FURTHER SIDE
OF THE WOMEN AND WHILST THIS PROCEEDED A DEEP HUSH GRADUALLY FELL UPON
THE PEOPLE
NOW BY COMMAND THE MASSES PARTED AND FELL ASIDE AND THE KING SAW A
SPECTACLE THAT FROZE THE MARROW IN HIS BONES
FAGGOTS HAD BEEN PILED
ABOUT THE TWO WOMEN AND A KNEELING MAN WAS LIGHTING THEM
THE WOMEN BOWED THEIR HEADS AND COVERED THEIR FACES WITH THEIR HANDS
THE YELLOW FLAMES BEGAN TO CLIMB UPWARD AMONG THE SNAPPING AND CRACKLING
FAGGOTS AND WREATHS OF BLUE SMOKE TO STREAM AWAY ON THE WIND THE
CLERGYMAN LIFTED HIS HANDS AND BEGAN A PRAYER JUST THEN TWO YOUNG GIRLS
CAME FLYING THROUGH THE GREAT GATE UTTERING PIERCING SCREAMS AND THREW
THEMSELVES UPON THE WOMEN AT THE STAKE
INSTANTLY THEY WERE TORN AWAY
BY THE OFFICERS AND ONE OF THEM WAS KEPT IN A TIGHT GRIP BUT THE OTHER
BROKE LOOSE SAYING SHE WOULD DIE WITH HER MOTHER AND BEFORE SHE COULD
BE STOPPED SHE HAD FLUNG HER ARMS ABOUT HER MOTHER'S NECK AGAIN
SHE
WAS TORN AWAY ONCE MORE AND WITH HER GOWN ON FIRE
TWO OR THREE MEN
HELD HER AND THE BURNING PORTION OF HER GOWN WAS SNATCHED OFF AND
THROWN FLAMING ASIDE SHE STRUGGLING ALL THE WHILE TO FREE HERSELF AND
SAYING SHE WOULD BE ALONE IN THE WORLD NOW AND BEGGING TO BE ALLOWED
TO DIE WITH HER MOTHER
BOTH THE GIRLS SCREAMED CONTINUALLY AND FOUGHT
FOR FREEDOM BUT SUDDENLY THIS TUMULT WAS DROWNED UNDER A VOLLEY OF
HEART PIERCING SHRIEKS OF MORTAL AGONY THE KING GLANCED FROM THE
FRANTIC GIRLS TO THE STAKE THEN TURNED AWAY AND LEANED HIS ASHEN FACE
AGAINST THE WALL AND LOOKED NO MORE
HE SAID THAT WHICH I HAVE SEEN
IN THAT ONE LITTLE MOMENT WILL NEVER GO OUT FROM MY MEMORY BUT WILL
ABIDE THERE AND I SHALL SEE IT ALL THE DAYS AND DREAM OF IT ALL THE
NIGHTS TILL I DIE
WOULD GOD I HAD BEEN BLIND
HENDON WAS WATCHING THE KING
HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH SATISFACTION
HIS DISORDER MENDETH HE HATH CHANGED AND GROWETH GENTLER
IF HE HAD
FOLLOWED HIS WONT HE WOULD HAVE STORMED AT THESE VARLETS AND SAID HE
WAS KING AND COMMANDED THAT THE WOMEN BE TURNED LOOSE UNSCATHED
SOON
HIS DELUSION WILL PASS AWAY AND BE FORGOTTEN AND HIS POOR MIND WILL BE
WHOLE AGAIN
GOD SPEED THE DAY
THAT SAME DAY SEVERAL PRISONERS WERE BROUGHT IN TO REMAIN OVER NIGHT
WHO WERE BEING CONVEYED UNDER GUARD TO VARIOUS PLACES IN THE KINGDOM
TO UNDERGO PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMES COMMITTED
THE KING CONVERSED WITH
THESE HE HAD MADE IT A POINT FROM THE BEGINNING TO INSTRUCT HIMSELF
FOR THE KINGLY OFFICE BY QUESTIONING PRISONERS WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY
OFFERED AND THE TALE OF THEIR WOES WRUNG HIS HEART
ONE OF THEM WAS
A POOR HALF WITTED WOMAN WHO HAD STOLEN A YARD OR TWO OF CLOTH FROM A
WEAVER SHE WAS TO BE HANGED FOR IT
ANOTHER WAS A MAN WHO HAD BEEN
ACCUSED OF STEALING A HORSE HE SAID THE PROOF HAD FAILED AND HE HAD
IMAGINED THAT HE WAS SAFE FROM THE HALTER BUT NO HE WAS HARDLY FREE
BEFORE HE WAS ARRAIGNED FOR KILLING A DEER IN THE KING'S PARK THIS WAS
PROVED AGAINST HIM AND NOW HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE GALLOWS
THERE WAS
A TRADESMAN'S APPRENTICE WHOSE CASE PARTICULARLY DISTRESSED THE KING
THIS YOUTH SAID HE FOUND A HAWK ONE EVENING THAT HAD ESCAPED FROM ITS
OWNER AND HE TOOK IT HOME WITH HIM IMAGINING HIMSELF ENTITLED TO IT
BUT THE COURT CONVICTED HIM OF STEALING IT AND SENTENCED HIM TO DEATH
THE KING WAS FURIOUS OVER THESE INHUMANITIES AND WANTED HENDON TO BREAK
JAIL AND FLY WITH HIM TO WESTMINSTER SO THAT HE COULD MOUNT HIS THRONE
AND HOLD OUT HIS SCEPTRE IN MERCY OVER THESE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE AND
SAVE THEIR LIVES
POOR CHILD SIGHED HENDON THESE WOEFUL TALES
HAVE BROUGHT HIS MALADY UPON HIM AGAIN ALACK BUT FOR THIS EVIL HAP HE
WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL IN A LITTLE TIME
AMONG THESE PRISONERS WAS AN OLD LAWYER A MAN WITH A STRONG FACE AND A
DAUNTLESS MIEN
THREE YEARS PAST HE HAD WRITTEN A PAMPHLET AGAINST THE
LORD CHANCELLOR ACCUSING HIM OF INJUSTICE AND HAD BEEN PUNISHED FOR
IT BY THE LOSS OF HIS EARS IN THE PILLORY AND DEGRADATION FROM THE
BAR AND IN ADDITION HAD BEEN FINED 3 000 POUNDS AND SENTENCED TO
IMPRISONMENT FOR LIFE
LATELY HE HAD REPEATED HIS OFFENCE AND IN
CONSEQUENCE WAS NOW UNDER SENTENCE TO LOSE WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS
PAY A FINE OF 5 000 POUNDS BE BRANDED ON BOTH CHEEKS AND REMAIN IN
PRISON FOR LIFE
THESE BE HONOURABLE SCARS HE SAID AND TURNED BACK HIS GREY HAIR AND
SHOWED THE MUTILATED STUBS OF WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN HIS EARS
THE KING'S EYE BURNED WITH PASSION
HE SAID
NONE BELIEVE IN ME NEITHER WILT THOU
BUT NO MATTER WITHIN THE
COMPASS OF A MONTH THOU SHALT BE FREE AND MORE THE LAWS THAT HAVE
DISHONOURED THEE AND SHAMED THE ENGLISH NAME SHALL BE SWEPT FROM THE
STATUTE BOOKS
THE WORLD IS MADE WRONG KINGS SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL TO
THEIR OWN LAWS AT TIMES AND SO LEARN MERCY 1
CHAPTER XXVIII
THE SACRIFICE
MEANTIME MILES WAS GROWING SUFFICIENTLY TIRED OF CONFINEMENT AND
INACTION
BUT NOW HIS TRIAL CAME ON TO HIS GREAT GRATIFICATION AND
HE THOUGHT HE COULD WELCOME ANY SENTENCE PROVIDED A FURTHER IMPRISONMENT
SHOULD NOT BE A PART OF IT
BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT
HE WAS IN
A FINE FURY WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF DESCRIBED AS A 'STURDY VAGABOND' AND
SENTENCED TO SIT TWO HOURS IN THE STOCKS FOR BEARING THAT CHARACTER
AND FOR ASSAULTING THE MASTER OF HENDON HALL
HIS PRETENSIONS AS TO
BROTHERSHIP WITH HIS PROSECUTOR AND RIGHTFUL HEIRSHIP TO THE HENDON
HONOURS AND ESTATES WERE LEFT CONTEMPTUOUSLY UNNOTICED AS BEING NOT
EVEN WORTH EXAMINATION
HE RAGED AND THREATENED ON HIS WAY TO PUNISHMENT BUT IT DID NO GOOD HE
WAS SNATCHED ROUGHLY ALONG BY THE OFFICERS AND GOT AN OCCASIONAL CUFF
BESIDES FOR HIS IRREVERENT CONDUCT
THE KING COULD NOT PIERCE THROUGH THE RABBLE THAT SWARMED BEHIND SO
HE WAS OBLIGED TO FOLLOW IN THE REAR REMOTE FROM HIS GOOD FRIEND AND
SERVANT
THE KING HAD BEEN NEARLY CONDEMNED TO THE STOCKS HIMSELF FOR
BEING IN SUCH BAD COMPANY BUT HAD BEEN LET OFF WITH A LECTURE AND A
WARNING IN CONSIDERATION OF HIS YOUTH
WHEN THE CROWD AT LAST HALTED
HE FLITTED FEVERISHLY FROM POINT TO POINT AROUND ITS OUTER RIM HUNTING
A PLACE TO GET THROUGH AND AT LAST AFTER A DEAL OF DIFFICULTY AND
DELAY SUCCEEDED
THERE SAT HIS POOR HENCHMAN IN THE DEGRADING STOCKS
THE SPORT AND BUTT OF A DIRTY MOB HE THE BODY SERVANT OF THE KING
OF ENGLAND EDWARD HAD HEARD THE SENTENCE PRONOUNCED BUT HE HAD NOT
REALISED THE HALF THAT IT MEANT
HIS ANGER BEGAN TO RISE AS THE SENSE
OF THIS NEW INDIGNITY WHICH HAD BEEN PUT UPON HIM SANK HOME IT JUMPED
TO SUMMER HEAT THE NEXT MOMENT WHEN HE SAW AN EGG SAIL THROUGH THE AIR
AND CRUSH ITSELF AGAINST HENDON'S CHEEK AND HEARD THE CROWD ROAR
ITS ENJOYMENT OF THE EPISODE
HE SPRANG ACROSS THE OPEN CIRCLE AND
CONFRONTED THE OFFICER IN CHARGE CRYING
FOR SHAME THIS IS MY SERVANT SET HIM FREE I AM THE
OH PEACE EXCLAIMED HENDON IN A PANIC THOU'LT DESTROY THYSELF
MIND HIM NOT OFFICER HE IS MAD
GIVE THYSELF NO TROUBLE AS TO THE MATTER OF MINDING HIM GOOD MAN I
HAVE SMALL MIND TO MIND HIM BUT AS TO TEACHING HIM SOMEWHAT TO THAT
I AM WELL INCLINED HE TURNED TO A SUBORDINATE AND SAID GIVE THE
LITTLE FOOL A TASTE OR TWO OF THE LASH TO MEND HIS MANNERS
HALF A DOZEN WILL BETTER SERVE HIS TURN SUGGESTED SIR HUGH WHO HAD
RIDDEN UP A MOMENT BEFORE TO TAKE A PASSING GLANCE AT THE PROCEEDINGS
THE KING WAS SEIZED
HE DID NOT EVEN STRUGGLE SO PARALYSED WAS HE
WITH THE MERE THOUGHT OF THE MONSTROUS OUTRAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED TO BE
INFLICTED UPON HIS SACRED PERSON
HISTORY WAS ALREADY DEFILED WITH
THE RECORD OF THE SCOURGING OF AN ENGLISH KING WITH WHIPS IT WAS AN
INTOLERABLE REFLECTION THAT HE MUST FURNISH A DUPLICATE OF THAT SHAMEFUL
PAGE
HE WAS IN THE TOILS THERE WAS NO HELP FOR HIM HE MUST EITHER
TAKE THIS PUNISHMENT OR BEG FOR ITS REMISSION
HARD CONDITIONS HE
WOULD TAKE THE STRIPES A KING MIGHT DO THAT BUT A KING COULD NOT BEG
BUT MEANTIME MILES HENDON WAS RESOLVING THE DIFFICULTY
LET THE CHILD
GO SAID HE YE HEARTLESS DOGS DO YE NOT SEE HOW YOUNG AND FRAIL HE
IS LET HIM GO I WILL TAKE HIS LASHES
MARRY A GOOD THOUGHT AND THANKS FOR IT SAID SIR HUGH HIS FACE
LIGHTING WITH A SARDONIC SATISFACTION
LET THE LITTLE BEGGAR GO AND
GIVE THIS FELLOW A DOZEN IN HIS PLACE AN HONEST DOZEN WELL LAID ON
THE KING WAS IN THE ACT OF ENTERING A FIERCE PROTEST BUT SIR HUGH
SILENCED HIM WITH THE POTENT REMARK YES SPEAK UP DO AND FREE THY
MIND ONLY MARK YE THAT FOR EACH WORD YOU UTTER HE SHALL GET SIX
STROKES THE MORE
HENDON WAS REMOVED FROM THE STOCKS AND HIS BACK LAID BARE AND WHILST
THE LASH WAS APPLIED THE POOR LITTLE KING TURNED AWAY HIS FACE AND
ALLOWED UNROYAL TEARS TO CHANNEL HIS CHEEKS UNCHECKED
AH BRAVE GOOD
HEART HE SAID TO HIMSELF THIS LOYAL DEED SHALL NEVER PERISH OUT OF
MY MEMORY
I WILL NOT FORGET IT AND NEITHER SHALL THEY HE ADDED
WITH PASSION
WHILST HE MUSED HIS APPRECIATION OF HENDON'S MAGNANIMOUS
CONDUCT GREW TO GREATER AND STILL GREATER DIMENSIONS IN HIS MIND AND
SO ALSO DID HIS GRATEFULNESS FOR IT
PRESENTLY HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHO
SAVES HIS PRINCE FROM WOUNDS AND POSSIBLE DEATH AND THIS HE DID FOR
ME PERFORMS HIGH SERVICE BUT IT IS LITTLE IT IS NOTHING OH LESS
THAN NOTHING WHEN 'TIS WEIGHED AGAINST THE ACT OF HIM WHO SAVES HIS
PRINCE FROM SHAME
HENDON MADE NO OUTCRY UNDER THE SCOURGE BUT BORE THE HEAVY BLOWS WITH
SOLDIERLY FORTITUDE
THIS TOGETHER WITH HIS REDEEMING THE BOY BY
TAKING HIS STRIPES FOR HIM COMPELLED THE RESPECT OF EVEN THAT FORLORN
AND DEGRADED MOB THAT WAS GATHERED THERE AND ITS GIBES AND HOOTINGS
DIED AWAY AND NO SOUND REMAINED BUT THE SOUND OF THE FALLING BLOWS
THE STILLNESS THAT PERVADED THE PLACE WHEN HENDON FOUND HIMSELF ONCE
MORE IN THE STOCKS WAS IN STRONG CONTRAST WITH THE INSULTING CLAMOUR
WHICH HAD PREVAILED THERE SO LITTLE A WHILE BEFORE
THE KING CAME
SOFTLY TO HENDON'S SIDE AND WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
KINGS CANNOT ENNOBLE THEE THOU GOOD GREAT SOUL FOR ONE WHO IS HIGHER
THAN KINGS HATH DONE THAT FOR THEE BUT A KING CAN CONFIRM THY NOBILITY
TO MEN HE PICKED UP THE SCOURGE FROM THE GROUND TOUCHED HENDON'S
BLEEDING SHOULDERS LIGHTLY WITH IT AND WHISPERED EDWARD OF ENGLAND
DUBS THEE EARL
HENDON WAS TOUCHED
THE WATER WELLED TO HIS EYES YET AT THE SAME TIME
THE GRISLY HUMOUR OF THE SITUATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES SO UNDERMINED HIS
GRAVITY THAT IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO KEEP SOME SIGN OF HIS INWARD
MIRTH FROM SHOWING OUTSIDE
TO BE SUDDENLY HOISTED NAKED AND GORY
FROM THE COMMON STOCKS TO THE ALPINE ALTITUDE AND SPLENDOUR OF
AN EARLDOM SEEMED TO HIM THE LAST POSSIBILITY IN THE LINE OF THE
GROTESQUE
HE SAID TO HIMSELF NOW AM I FINELY TINSELLED INDEED
THE SPECTRE KNIGHT OF THE KINGDOM OF DREAMS AND SHADOWS IS BECOME A
SPECTRE EARL A DIZZY FLIGHT FOR A CALLOW WING AN' THIS GO ON I
SHALL PRESENTLY BE HUNG LIKE A VERY MAYPOLE WITH FANTASTIC GAUDS AND
MAKE BELIEVE HONOURS
BUT I SHALL VALUE THEM ALL VALUELESS AS
THEY ARE FOR THE LOVE THAT DOTH BESTOW THEM
BETTER THESE POOR MOCK
DIGNITIES OF MINE THAT COME UNASKED FROM A CLEAN HAND AND A RIGHT
SPIRIT THAN REAL ONES BOUGHT BY SERVILITY FROM GRUDGING AND INTERESTED
POWER
THE DREADED SIR HUGH WHEELED HIS HORSE ABOUT AND AS HE SPURRED AWAY
THE LIVING WALL DIVIDED SILENTLY TO LET HIM PASS AND AS SILENTLY CLOSED
TOGETHER AGAIN
AND SO REMAINED NOBODY WENT SO FAR AS TO VENTURE
A REMARK IN FAVOUR OF THE PRISONER OR IN COMPLIMENT TO HIM BUT NO
MATTER THE ABSENCE OF ABUSE WAS A SUFFICIENT HOMAGE IN ITSELF
A
LATE COMER WHO WAS NOT POSTED AS TO THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHO
DELIVERED A SNEER AT THE 'IMPOSTOR AND WAS IN THE ACT OF FOLLOWING IT
WITH A DEAD CAT WAS PROMPTLY KNOCKED DOWN AND KICKED OUT WITHOUT ANY
WORDS AND THEN THE DEEP QUIET RESUMED SWAY ONCE MORE
CHAPTER XXIX
TO LONDON
WHEN HENDON'S TERM OF SERVICE IN THE STOCKS WAS FINISHED HE WAS
RELEASED AND ORDERED TO QUIT THE REGION AND COME BACK NO MORE
HIS SWORD
WAS RESTORED TO HIM AND ALSO HIS MULE AND HIS DONKEY
HE MOUNTED
AND RODE OFF FOLLOWED BY THE KING THE CROWD OPENING WITH QUIET
RESPECTFULNESS TO LET THEM PASS AND THEN DISPERSING WHEN THEY WERE
GONE
HENDON WAS SOON ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
THERE WERE QUESTIONS OF HIGH
IMPORT TO BE ANSWERED
WHAT SHOULD HE DO WHITHER SHOULD HE GO
POWERFUL HELP MUST BE FOUND SOMEWHERE OR HE MUST RELINQUISH HIS
INHERITANCE AND REMAIN UNDER THE IMPUTATION OF BEING AN IMPOSTOR
BESIDES
WHERE COULD HE HOPE TO FIND THIS POWERFUL HELP WHERE
INDEED IT WAS A KNOTTY QUESTION
BY AND BY A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM
WHICH POINTED TO A POSSIBILITY THE SLENDEREST OF SLENDER POSSIBILITIES
CERTAINLY BUT STILL WORTH CONSIDERING FOR LACK OF ANY OTHER THAT
PROMISED ANYTHING AT ALL
HE REMEMBERED WHAT OLD ANDREWS HAD SAID ABOUT
THE YOUNG KING'S GOODNESS AND HIS GENEROUS CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE WRONGED
AND UNFORTUNATE
WHY NOT GO AND TRY TO GET SPEECH OF HIM AND BEG FOR
JUSTICE AH YES BUT COULD SO FANTASTIC A PAUPER GET ADMISSION TO THE
AUGUST PRESENCE OF A MONARCH NEVER MIND LET THAT MATTER TAKE CARE OF
ITSELF IT WAS A BRIDGE THAT WOULD NOT NEED TO BE CROSSED TILL HE SHOULD
COME TO IT
HE WAS AN OLD CAMPAIGNER AND USED TO INVENTING SHIFTS AND
EXPEDIENTS NO DOUBT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY
YES HE WOULD
STRIKE FOR THE CAPITAL
MAYBE HIS FATHER'S OLD FRIEND SIR HUMPHREY
MARLOW WOULD HELP HIM 'GOOD OLD SIR HUMPHREY HEAD LIEUTENANT OF THE
LATE KING'S KITCHEN OR STABLES OR SOMETHING' MILES COULD NOT REMEMBER
JUST WHAT OR WHICH
NOW THAT HE HAD SOMETHING TO TURN HIS ENERGIES TO
A DISTINCTLY DEFINED OBJECT TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOG OF HUMILIATION AND
DEPRESSION WHICH HAD SETTLED DOWN UPON HIS SPIRITS LIFTED AND BLEW AWAY
AND HE RAISED HIS HEAD AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
HE WAS SURPRISED TO SEE
HOW FAR HE HAD COME THE VILLAGE WAS AWAY BEHIND HIM
THE KING WAS
JOGGING ALONG IN HIS WAKE WITH HIS HEAD BOWED FOR HE TOO WAS DEEP
IN PLANS AND THINKINGS
A SORROWFUL MISGIVING CLOUDED HENDON'S NEW BORN
CHEERFULNESS WOULD THE BOY BE WILLING TO GO AGAIN TO A CITY WHERE
DURING ALL HIS BRIEF LIFE HE HAD NEVER KNOWN ANYTHING BUT ILL USAGE AND
PINCHING WANT BUT THE QUESTION MUST BE ASKED IT COULD NOT BE AVOIDED
SO HENDON REINED UP AND CALLED OUT
I HAD FORGOTTEN TO INQUIRE WHITHER WE ARE BOUND
THY COMMANDS MY
LIEGE
TO LONDON
HENDON MOVED ON AGAIN MIGHTILY CONTENTED WITH THE ANSWER BUT ASTOUNDED
AT IT TOO
THE WHOLE JOURNEY WAS MADE WITHOUT AN ADVENTURE OF IMPORTANCE
BUT IT
ENDED WITH ONE
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK ON THE NIGHT OF THE 19TH OF FEBRUARY
THEY STEPPED UPON LONDON BRIDGE IN THE MIDST OF A WRITHING STRUGGLING
JAM OF HOWLING AND HURRAHING PEOPLE WHOSE BEER JOLLY FACES STOOD OUT
STRONGLY IN THE GLARE FROM MANIFOLD TORCHES AND AT THAT INSTANT THE
DECAYING HEAD OF SOME FORMER DUKE OR OTHER GRANDEE TUMBLED DOWN BETWEEN
THEM STRIKING HENDON ON THE ELBOW AND THEN BOUNDING OFF AMONG THE
HURRYING CONFUSION OF FEET
SO EVANESCENT AND UNSTABLE ARE MEN'S WORKS
IN THIS WORLD THE LATE GOOD KING IS BUT THREE WEEKS DEAD AND THREE
DAYS IN HIS GRAVE AND ALREADY THE ADORNMENTS WHICH HE TOOK SUCH PAINS
TO SELECT FROM PROMINENT PEOPLE FOR HIS NOBLE BRIDGE ARE FALLING
A
CITIZEN STUMBLED OVER THAT HEAD AND DROVE HIS OWN HEAD INTO THE BACK OF
SOMEBODY IN FRONT OF HIM WHO TURNED AND KNOCKED DOWN THE FIRST PERSON
THAT CAME HANDY AND WAS PROMPTLY LAID OUT HIMSELF BY THAT PERSON'S
FRIEND
IT WAS THE RIGHT RIPE TIME FOR A FREE FIGHT FOR THE
FESTIVITIES OF THE MORROW CORONATION DAY WERE ALREADY BEGINNING
EVERYBODY WAS FULL OF STRONG DRINK AND PATRIOTISM WITHIN FIVE MINUTES
THE FREE FIGHT WAS OCCUPYING A GOOD DEAL OF GROUND WITHIN TEN OR TWELVE
IT COVERED AN ACRE OF SO AND WAS BECOME A RIOT
BY THIS TIME HENDON
AND THE KING WERE HOPELESSLY SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER AND LOST IN THE
RUSH AND TURMOIL OF THE ROARING MASSES OF HUMANITY
AND SO WE LEAVE
THEM
CHAPTER XXX
TOM'S PROGRESS
WHILST THE TRUE KING WANDERED ABOUT THE LAND POORLY CLAD POORLY
FED CUFFED AND DERIDED BY TRAMPS ONE WHILE HERDING WITH THIEVES
AND MURDERERS IN A JAIL ANOTHER AND CALLED IDIOT AND IMPOSTOR BY
ALL IMPARTIALLY THE MOCK KING TOM CANTY ENJOYED QUITE A DIFFERENT
EXPERIENCE
WHEN WE SAW HIM LAST ROYALTY WAS JUST BEGINNING TO HAVE A BRIGHT SIDE
FOR HIM
THIS BRIGHT SIDE WENT ON BRIGHTENING MORE AND MORE EVERY
DAY IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE IT WAS BECOME ALMOST ALL SUNSHINE AND
DELIGHTFULNESS
HE LOST HIS FEARS HIS MISGIVINGS FADED OUT AND DIED
HIS EMBARRASSMENTS DEPARTED AND GAVE PLACE TO AN EASY AND CONFIDENT
BEARING
HE WORKED THE WHIPPING BOY MINE TO EVER INCREASING PROFIT
HE ORDERED MY LADY ELIZABETH AND MY LADY JANE GREY INTO HIS PRESENCE
WHEN HE WANTED TO PLAY OR TALK AND DISMISSED THEM WHEN HE WAS DONE WITH
THEM WITH THE AIR OF ONE FAMILIARLY ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH PERFORMANCES
IT NO LONGER CONFUSED HIM TO HAVE THESE LOFTY PERSONAGES KISS HIS HAND
AT PARTING
HE CAME TO ENJOY BEING CONDUCTED TO BED IN STATE AT NIGHT AND DRESSED
WITH INTRICATE AND SOLEMN CEREMONY IN THE MORNING
IT CAME TO BE A
PROUD PLEASURE TO MARCH TO DINNER ATTENDED BY A GLITTERING PROCESSION
OF OFFICERS OF STATE AND GENTLEMEN AT ARMS INSOMUCH INDEED THAT HE
DOUBLED HIS GUARD OF GENTLEMEN AT ARMS AND MADE THEM A HUNDRED
HE
LIKED TO HEAR THE BUGLES SOUNDING DOWN THE LONG CORRIDORS AND THE
DISTANT VOICES RESPONDING WAY FOR THE KING
HE EVEN LEARNED TO ENJOY SITTING IN THRONED STATE IN COUNCIL AND
SEEMING TO BE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LORD PROTECTOR'S MOUTHPIECE
HE
LIKED TO RECEIVE GREAT AMBASSADORS AND THEIR GORGEOUS TRAINS AND LISTEN
TO THE AFFECTIONATE MESSAGES THEY BROUGHT FROM ILLUSTRIOUS MONARCHS WHO
CALLED HIM BROTHER
O HAPPY TOM CANTY LATE OF OFFAL COURT
HE ENJOYED HIS SPLENDID CLOTHES AND ORDERED MORE HE FOUND HIS FOUR
HUNDRED SERVANTS TOO FEW FOR HIS PROPER GRANDEUR AND TREBLED THEM
THE
ADULATION OF SALAAMING COURTIERS CAME TO BE SWEET MUSIC TO HIS EARS
HE
REMAINED KIND AND GENTLE AND A STURDY AND DETERMINED CHAMPION OF ALL
THAT WERE OPPRESSED AND HE MADE TIRELESS WAR UPON UNJUST LAWS YET
UPON OCCASION BEING OFFENDED HE COULD TURN UPON AN EARL OR EVEN A
DUKE AND GIVE HIM A LOOK THAT WOULD MAKE HIM TREMBLE
ONCE WHEN HIS
ROYAL 'SISTER THE GRIMLY HOLY LADY MARY SET HERSELF TO REASON WITH
HIM AGAINST THE WISDOM OF HIS COURSE IN PARDONING SO MANY PEOPLE WHO
WOULD OTHERWISE BE JAILED OR HANGED OR BURNED AND REMINDED HIM THAT
THEIR AUGUST LATE FATHER'S PRISONS HAD SOMETIMES CONTAINED AS HIGH AS
SIXTY THOUSAND CONVICTS AT ONE TIME AND THAT DURING HIS ADMIRABLE REIGN
HE HAD DELIVERED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND THIEVES AND ROBBERS OVER TO DEATH
BY THE EXECUTIONER 9 THE BOY WAS FILLED WITH GENEROUS INDIGNATION
AND COMMANDED HER TO GO TO HER CLOSET AND BESEECH GOD TO TAKE AWAY THE
STONE THAT WAS IN HER BREAST AND GIVE HER A HUMAN HEART
DID TOM CANTY NEVER FEEL TROUBLED ABOUT THE POOR LITTLE RIGHTFUL PRINCE
WHO HAD TREATED HIM SO KINDLY AND FLOWN OUT WITH SUCH HOT ZEAL TO
AVENGE HIM UPON THE INSOLENT SENTINEL AT THE PALACE GATE YES HIS FIRST
ROYAL DAYS AND NIGHTS WERE PRETTY WELL SPRINKLED WITH PAINFUL THOUGHTS
ABOUT THE LOST PRINCE AND WITH SINCERE LONGINGS FOR HIS RETURN AND
HAPPY RESTORATION TO HIS NATIVE RIGHTS AND SPLENDOURS
BUT AS TIME
WORE ON AND THE PRINCE DID NOT COME TOM'S MIND BECAME MORE AND MORE
OCCUPIED WITH HIS NEW AND ENCHANTING EXPERIENCES AND BY LITTLE AND
LITTLE THE VANISHED MONARCH FADED ALMOST OUT OF HIS THOUGHTS AND
FINALLY WHEN HE DID INTRUDE UPON THEM AT INTERVALS HE WAS BECOME AN
UNWELCOME SPECTRE FOR HE MADE TOM FEEL GUILTY AND ASHAMED
TOM'S POOR MOTHER AND SISTERS TRAVELLED THE SAME ROAD OUT OF HIS MIND
AT FIRST HE PINED FOR THEM SORROWED FOR THEM LONGED TO SEE THEM BUT
LATER THE THOUGHT OF THEIR COMING SOME DAY IN THEIR RAGS AND DIRT AND
BETRAYING HIM WITH THEIR KISSES AND PULLING HIM DOWN FROM HIS LOFTY
PLACE AND DRAGGING HIM BACK TO PENURY AND DEGRADATION AND THE SLUMS
MADE HIM SHUDDER
AT LAST THEY CEASED TO TROUBLE HIS THOUGHTS ALMOST
WHOLLY
AND HE WAS CONTENT EVEN GLAD FOR WHENEVER THEIR MOURNFUL
AND ACCUSING FACES DID RISE BEFORE HIM NOW THEY MADE HIM FEEL MORE
DESPICABLE THAN THE WORMS THAT CRAWL
AT MIDNIGHT OF THE 19TH OF FEBRUARY TOM CANTY WAS SINKING TO SLEEP IN
HIS RICH BED IN THE PALACE GUARDED BY HIS LOYAL VASSALS AND SURROUNDED
BY THE POMPS OF ROYALTY A HAPPY BOY FOR TOMORROW WAS THE DAY APPOINTED
FOR HIS SOLEMN CROWNING AS KING OF ENGLAND
AT THAT SAME HOUR EDWARD
THE TRUE KING HUNGRY AND THIRSTY SOILED AND DRAGGLED WORN WITH
TRAVEL AND CLOTHED IN RAGS AND SHREDS HIS SHARE OF THE RESULTS OF THE
RIOT WAS WEDGED IN AMONG A CROWD OF PEOPLE WHO WERE WATCHING WITH DEEP
INTEREST CERTAIN HURRYING GANGS OF WORKMEN WHO STREAMED IN AND OUT OF
WESTMINSTER ABBEY BUSY AS ANTS THEY WERE MAKING THE LAST PREPARATION
FOR THE ROYAL CORONATION
CHAPTER XXXI
THE RECOGNITION PROCESSION
WHEN TOM CANTY AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH A
THUNDEROUS MURMUR ALL THE DISTANCES WERE CHARGED WITH IT
IT WAS
MUSIC TO HIM FOR IT MEANT THAT THE ENGLISH WORLD WAS OUT IN ITS
STRENGTH TO GIVE LOYAL WELCOME TO THE GREAT DAY
PRESENTLY TOM FOUND HIMSELF ONCE MORE THE CHIEF FIGURE IN A WONDERFUL
FLOATING PAGEANT ON THE THAMES FOR BY ANCIENT CUSTOM THE 'RECOGNITION
PROCESSION' THROUGH LONDON MUST START FROM THE TOWER AND HE WAS BOUND
THITHER
WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE THE SIDES OF THE VENERABLE FORTRESS SEEMED
SUDDENLY RENT IN A THOUSAND PLACES AND FROM EVERY RENT LEAPED A
RED TONGUE OF FLAME AND A WHITE GUSH OF SMOKE A DEAFENING EXPLOSION
FOLLOWED WHICH DROWNED THE SHOUTINGS OF THE MULTITUDE AND MADE THE
GROUND TREMBLE THE FLAME JETS THE SMOKE AND THE EXPLOSIONS WERE
REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH MARVELLOUS CELERITY SO THAT IN A FEW
MOMENTS THE OLD TOWER DISAPPEARED IN THE VAST FOG OF ITS OWN SMOKE ALL
BUT THE VERY TOP OF THE TALL PILE CALLED THE WHITE TOWER THIS WITH
ITS BANNERS STOOD OUT ABOVE THE DENSE BANK OF VAPOUR AS A MOUNTAIN PEAK
PROJECTS ABOVE A CLOUD RACK
TOM CANTY SPLENDIDLY ARRAYED MOUNTED A PRANCING WAR STEED WHOSE RICH
TRAPPINGS ALMOST REACHED TO THE GROUND HIS 'UNCLE THE LORD PROTECTOR
SOMERSET SIMILARLY MOUNTED TOOK PLACE IN HIS REAR THE KING'S GUARD
FORMED IN SINGLE RANKS ON EITHER SIDE CLAD IN BURNISHED ARMOUR
AFTER THE PROTECTOR FOLLOWED A SEEMINGLY INTERMINABLE PROCESSION OF
RESPLENDENT NOBLES ATTENDED BY THEIR VASSALS AFTER THESE CAME THE LORD
MAYOR AND THE ALDERMANIC BODY IN CRIMSON VELVET ROBES AND WITH THEIR
GOLD CHAINS ACROSS THEIR BREASTS AND AFTER THESE THE OFFICERS AND
MEMBERS OF ALL THE GUILDS OF LONDON IN RICH RAIMENT AND BEARING THE
SHOWY BANNERS OF THE SEVERAL CORPORATIONS
ALSO IN THE PROCESSION AS A
SPECIAL GUARD OF HONOUR THROUGH THE CITY WAS THE ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE
ARTILLERY COMPANY AN ORGANISATION ALREADY THREE HUNDRED YEARS OLD
AT THAT TIME AND THE ONLY MILITARY BODY IN ENGLAND POSSESSING THE
PRIVILEGE WHICH IT STILL POSSESSES IN OUR DAY OF HOLDING ITSELF
INDEPENDENT OF THE COMMANDS OF PARLIAMENT
IT WAS A BRILLIANT
SPECTACLE AND WAS HAILED WITH ACCLAMATIONS ALL ALONG THE LINE AS IT
TOOK ITS STATELY WAY THROUGH THE PACKED MULTITUDES OF CITIZENS
THE
CHRONICLER SAYS 'THE KING AS HE ENTERED THE CITY WAS RECEIVED BY THE
PEOPLE WITH PRAYERS WELCOMINGS CRIES AND TENDER WORDS AND ALL SIGNS
WHICH ARGUE AN EARNEST LOVE OF SUBJECTS TOWARD THEIR SOVEREIGN AND THE
KING BY HOLDING UP HIS GLAD COUNTENANCE TO SUCH AS STOOD AFAR OFF AND
MOST TENDER LANGUAGE TO THOSE THAT STOOD NIGH HIS GRACE SHOWED HIMSELF
NO LESS THANKFUL TO RECEIVE THE PEOPLE'S GOODWILL THAN THEY TO OFFER IT
TO ALL THAT WISHED HIM WELL HE GAVE THANKS
TO SUCH AS BADE GOD SAVE
HIS GRACE HE SAID IN RETURN GOD SAVE YOU ALL AND ADDED THAT HE
THANKED THEM WITH ALL HIS HEART WONDERFULLY TRANSPORTED WERE THE
PEOPLE WITH THE LOVING ANSWERS AND GESTURES OF THEIR KING
IN FENCHURCH STREET A 'FAIR CHILD IN COSTLY APPAREL STOOD ON A STAGE
TO WELCOME HIS MAJESTY TO THE CITY
THE LAST VERSE OF HIS GREETING WAS
IN THESE WORDS
'WELCOME O KING AS MUCH AS HEARTS CAN THINK WELCOME AGAIN AS MUCH
AS TONGUE CAN TELL WELCOME TO JOYOUS TONGUES AND HEARTS THAT WILL
NOT SHRINK GOD THEE PRESERVE WE PRAY AND WISH THEE EVER WELL
THE PEOPLE BURST FORTH IN A GLAD SHOUT REPEATING WITH ONE VOICE WHAT
THE CHILD HAD SAID
TOM CANTY GAZED ABROAD OVER THE SURGING SEA OF
EAGER FACES AND HIS HEART SWELLED WITH EXULTATION AND HE FELT THAT
THE ONE THING WORTH LIVING FOR IN THIS WORLD WAS TO BE A KING AND A
NATION'S IDOL
PRESENTLY HE CAUGHT SIGHT AT A DISTANCE OF A COUPLE
OF HIS RAGGED OFFAL COURT COMRADES ONE OF THEM THE LORD HIGH ADMIRAL IN
HIS LATE MIMIC COURT THE OTHER THE FIRST LORD OF THE BEDCHAMBER IN THE
SAME PRETENTIOUS FICTION AND HIS PRIDE SWELLED HIGHER THAN EVER
OH
IF THEY COULD ONLY RECOGNISE HIM NOW WHAT UNSPEAKABLE GLORY IT WOULD
BE IF THEY COULD RECOGNISE HIM AND REALISE THAT THE DERIDED MOCK KING
OF THE SLUMS AND BACK ALLEYS WAS BECOME A REAL KING WITH ILLUSTRIOUS
DUKES AND PRINCES FOR HIS HUMBLE MENIALS AND THE ENGLISH WORLD AT HIS
FEET BUT HE HAD TO DENY HIMSELF AND CHOKE DOWN HIS DESIRE FOR SUCH
A RECOGNITION MIGHT COST MORE THAN IT WOULD COME TO SO HE TURNED AWAY
HIS HEAD AND LEFT THE TWO SOILED LADS TO GO ON WITH THEIR SHOUTINGS AND
GLAD ADULATIONS UNSUSPICIOUS OF WHOM IT WAS THEY WERE LAVISHING THEM
UPON
EVERY NOW AND THEN ROSE THE CRY A LARGESS A LARGESS AND TOM
RESPONDED BY SCATTERING A HANDFUL OF BRIGHT NEW COINS ABROAD FOR THE
MULTITUDE TO SCRAMBLE FOR
THE CHRONICLER SAYS 'AT THE UPPER END OF GRACECHURCH STREET BEFORE THE
SIGN OF THE EAGLE THE CITY HAD ERECTED A GORGEOUS ARCH BENEATH WHICH
WAS A STAGE WHICH STRETCHED FROM ONE SIDE OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER
THIS WAS AN HISTORICAL PAGEANT REPRESENTING THE KING'S IMMEDIATE
PROGENITORS
THERE SAT ELIZABETH OF YORK IN THE MIDST OF AN IMMENSE
WHITE ROSE WHOSE PETALS FORMED ELABORATE FURBELOWS AROUND HER BY HER
SIDE WAS HENRY VII ISSUING OUT OF A VAST RED ROSE DISPOSED IN THE
SAME MANNER THE HANDS OF THE ROYAL PAIR WERE LOCKED TOGETHER AND THE
WEDDING RING OSTENTATIOUSLY DISPLAYED
FROM THE RED AND WHITE ROSES
PROCEEDED A STEM WHICH REACHED UP TO A SECOND STAGE OCCUPIED BY HENRY
VIII ISSUING FROM A RED AND WHITE ROSE WITH THE EFFIGY OF THE NEW
KING'S MOTHER JANE SEYMOUR REPRESENTED BY HIS SIDE
ONE BRANCH SPRANG
FROM THIS PAIR WHICH MOUNTED TO A THIRD STAGE WHERE SAT THE EFFIGY OF
EDWARD VI
HIMSELF ENTHRONED IN ROYAL MAJESTY AND THE WHOLE PAGEANT
WAS FRAMED WITH WREATHS OF ROSES RED AND WHITE
THIS QUAINT AND GAUDY SPECTACLE SO WROUGHT UPON THE REJOICING PEOPLE
THAT THEIR ACCLAMATIONS UTTERLY SMOTHERED THE SMALL VOICE OF THE CHILD
WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO EXPLAIN THE THING IN EULOGISTIC RHYMES
BUT
TOM CANTY WAS NOT SORRY FOR THIS LOYAL UPROAR WAS SWEETER MUSIC TO HIM
THAN ANY POETRY NO MATTER WHAT ITS QUALITY MIGHT BE
WHITHERSOEVER TOM
TURNED HIS HAPPY YOUNG FACE THE PEOPLE RECOGNISED THE EXACTNESS OF HIS
EFFIGY'S LIKENESS TO HIMSELF THE FLESH AND BLOOD COUNTERPART AND NEW
WHIRLWINDS OF APPLAUSE BURST FORTH
THE GREAT PAGEANT MOVED ON AND STILL ON UNDER ONE TRIUMPHAL ARCH AFTER
ANOTHER AND PAST A BEWILDERING SUCCESSION OF SPECTACULAR AND SYMBOLICAL
TABLEAUX EACH OF WHICH TYPIFIED AND EXALTED SOME VIRTUE OR TALENT OR
MERIT OF THE LITTLE KING'S
'THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE OF CHEAPSIDE FROM
EVERY PENTHOUSE AND WINDOW HUNG BANNERS AND STREAMERS AND THE RICHEST
CARPETS STUFFS AND CLOTH OF GOLD TAPESTRIED THE STREETS SPECIMENS
OF THE GREAT WEALTH OF THE STORES WITHIN AND THE SPLENDOUR OF THIS
THOROUGHFARE WAS EQUALLED IN THE OTHER STREETS AND IN SOME EVEN
SURPASSED
AND ALL THESE WONDERS AND THESE MARVELS ARE TO WELCOME ME ME
MURMURED TOM CANTY
THE MOCK KING'S CHEEKS WERE FLUSHED WITH EXCITEMENT HIS EYES WERE
FLASHING HIS SENSES SWAM IN A DELIRIUM OF PLEASURE
AT THIS POINT
JUST AS HE WAS RAISING HIS HAND TO FLING ANOTHER RICH LARGESS HE CAUGHT
SIGHT OF A PALE ASTOUNDED FACE WHICH WAS STRAINED FORWARD OUT OF
THE SECOND RANK OF THE CROWD ITS INTENSE EYES RIVETED UPON HIM
A
SICKENING CONSTERNATION STRUCK THROUGH HIM HE RECOGNISED HIS
MOTHER AND UP FLEW HIS HAND PALM OUTWARD BEFORE HIS EYES THAT OLD
INVOLUNTARY GESTURE BORN OF A FORGOTTEN EPISODE AND PERPETUATED BY
HABIT
IN AN INSTANT MORE SHE HAD TORN HER WAY OUT OF THE PRESS AND
PAST THE GUARDS AND WAS AT HIS SIDE
SHE EMBRACED HIS LEG SHE COVERED
IT WITH KISSES SHE CRIED O MY CHILD MY DARLING LIFTING TOWARD HIM
A FACE THAT WAS TRANSFIGURED WITH JOY AND LOVE
THE SAME INSTANT AN
OFFICER OF THE KING'S GUARD SNATCHED HER AWAY WITH A CURSE AND SENT
HER REELING BACK WHENCE SHE CAME WITH A VIGOROUS IMPULSE FROM HIS
STRONG ARM
THE WORDS I DO NOT KNOW YOU WOMAN WERE FALLING FROM TOM
CANTY'S LIPS WHEN THIS PITEOUS THING OCCURRED BUT IT SMOTE HIM TO THE
HEART TO SEE HER TREATED SO AND AS SHE TURNED FOR A LAST GLIMPSE OF
HIM WHILST THE CROWD WAS SWALLOWING HER FROM HIS SIGHT SHE SEEMED SO
WOUNDED SO BROKEN HEARTED THAT A SHAME FELL UPON HIM WHICH CONSUMED
HIS PRIDE TO ASHES AND WITHERED HIS STOLEN ROYALTY
HIS GRANDEURS WERE
STRICKEN VALUELESS THEY SEEMED TO FALL AWAY FROM HIM LIKE ROTTEN RAGS
THE PROCESSION MOVED ON AND STILL ON THROUGH EVER AUGMENTING
SPLENDOURS AND EVER AUGMENTING TEMPESTS OF WELCOME BUT TO TOM CANTY
THEY WERE AS IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN
HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
ROYALTY
HAD LOST ITS GRACE AND SWEETNESS ITS POMPS WERE BECOME A REPROACH
REMORSE WAS EATING HIS HEART OUT
HE SAID WOULD GOD I WERE FREE OF
MY CAPTIVITY
HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY DROPPED BACK INTO THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THE FIRST DAYS
OF HIS COMPULSORY GREATNESS
THE SHINING PAGEANT STILL WENT WINDING LIKE A RADIANT AND INTERMINABLE
SERPENT DOWN THE CROOKED LANES OF THE QUAINT OLD CITY AND THROUGH THE
HUZZAING HOSTS BUT STILL THE KING RODE WITH BOWED HEAD AND VACANT EYES
SEEING ONLY HIS MOTHER'S FACE AND THAT WOUNDED LOOK IN IT
LARGESS LARGESS THE CRY FELL UPON AN UNHEEDING EAR
LONG LIVE EDWARD OF ENGLAND IT SEEMED AS IF THE EARTH SHOOK WITH THE
EXPLOSION BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE KING
HE HEARD IT ONLY AS
ONE HEARS THE THUNDER OF THE SURF WHEN IT IS BLOWN TO THE EAR OUT OF A
GREAT DISTANCE FOR IT WAS SMOTHERED UNDER ANOTHER SOUND WHICH WAS STILL
NEARER IN HIS OWN BREAST IN HIS ACCUSING CONSCIENCE A VOICE WHICH
KEPT REPEATING THOSE SHAMEFUL WORDS I DO NOT KNOW YOU WOMAN
THE WORDS SMOTE UPON THE KING'S SOUL AS THE STROKES OF A FUNERAL BELL
SMITE UPON THE SOUL OF A SURVIVING FRIEND WHEN THEY REMIND HIM OF SECRET
TREACHERIES SUFFERED AT HIS HANDS BY HIM THAT IS GONE
NEW GLORIES WERE UNFOLDED AT EVERY TURNING NEW WONDERS NEW MARVELS
SPRANG INTO VIEW THE PENT CLAMOURS OF WAITING BATTERIES WERE RELEASED
NEW RAPTURES POURED FROM THE THROATS OF THE WAITING MULTITUDES BUT THE
KING GAVE NO SIGN AND THE ACCUSING VOICE THAT WENT MOANING THROUGH HIS
COMFORTLESS BREAST WAS ALL THE SOUND HE HEARD
BY AND BY THE GLADNESS IN THE FACES OF THE POPULACE CHANGED A LITTLE
AND BECAME TOUCHED WITH A SOMETHING LIKE SOLICITUDE OR ANXIETY AN
ABATEMENT IN THE VOLUME OF THE APPLAUSE WAS OBSERVABLE TOO
THE LORD
PROTECTOR WAS QUICK TO NOTICE THESE THINGS HE WAS AS QUICK TO DETECT
THE CAUSE
HE SPURRED TO THE KING'S SIDE BENT LOW IN HIS SADDLE
UNCOVERED AND SAID
MY LIEGE IT IS AN ILL TIME FOR DREAMING
THE PEOPLE OBSERVE THY
DOWNCAST HEAD THY CLOUDED MIEN AND THEY TAKE IT FOR AN OMEN
BE
ADVISED UNVEIL THE SUN OF ROYALTY AND LET IT SHINE UPON THESE BODING
VAPOURS AND DISPERSE THEM
LIFT UP THY FACE AND SMILE UPON THE
PEOPLE
SO SAYING THE DUKE SCATTERED A HANDFUL OF COINS TO RIGHT AND LEFT THEN
RETIRED TO HIS PLACE
THE MOCK KING DID MECHANICALLY AS HE HAD BEEN
BIDDEN
HIS SMILE HAD NO HEART IN IT BUT FEW EYES WERE NEAR ENOUGH
OR SHARP ENOUGH TO DETECT THAT
THE NODDINGS OF HIS PLUMED HEAD AS HE
SALUTED HIS SUBJECTS WERE FULL OF GRACE AND GRACIOUSNESS THE LARGESS
WHICH HE DELIVERED FROM HIS HAND WAS ROYALLY LIBERAL SO THE PEOPLE'S
ANXIETY VANISHED AND THE ACCLAMATIONS BURST FORTH AGAIN IN AS MIGHTY A
VOLUME AS BEFORE
STILL ONCE MORE A LITTLE BEFORE THE PROGRESS WAS ENDED THE DUKE WAS
OBLIGED TO RIDE FORWARD AND MAKE REMONSTRANCE
HE WHISPERED
O DREAD SOVEREIGN SHAKE OFF THESE FATAL HUMOURS THE EYES OF THE WORLD
ARE UPON THEE THEN HE ADDED WITH SHARP ANNOYANCE PERDITION CATCH
THAT CRAZY PAUPER 'TWAS SHE THAT HATH DISTURBED YOUR HIGHNESS
THE GORGEOUS FIGURE TURNED A LUSTRELESS EYE UPON THE DUKE AND SAID IN A
DEAD VOICE
SHE WAS MY MOTHER
MY GOD GROANED THE PROTECTOR AS HE REINED HIS HORSE BACKWARD TO HIS
POST THE OMEN WAS PREGNANT WITH PROPHECY
HE IS GONE MAD AGAIN
CHAPTER XXXII
CORONATION DAY
LET US GO BACKWARD A FEW HOURS AND PLACE OURSELVES IN WESTMINSTER
ABBEY AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OF THIS MEMORABLE CORONATION DAY
WE ARE NOT WITHOUT COMPANY FOR ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL NIGHT WE FIND
THE TORCH LIGHTED GALLERIES ALREADY FILLING UP WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL
CONTENT TO SIT STILL AND WAIT SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS TILL THE TIME SHALL
COME FOR THEM TO SEE WHAT THEY MAY NOT HOPE TO SEE TWICE IN THEIR
LIVES THE CORONATION OF A KING
YES LONDON AND WESTMINSTER HAVE BEEN
ASTIR EVER SINCE THE WARNING GUNS BOOMED AT THREE O'CLOCK AND ALREADY
CROWDS OF UNTITLED RICH FOLK WHO HAVE BOUGHT THE PRIVILEGE OF TRYING
TO FIND SITTING ROOM IN THE GALLERIES ARE FLOCKING IN AT THE ENTRANCES
RESERVED FOR THEIR SORT
THE HOURS DRAG ALONG TEDIOUSLY ENOUGH
ALL STIR HAS CEASED FOR SOME
TIME FOR EVERY GALLERY HAS LONG AGO BEEN PACKED
WE MAY SIT NOW AND
LOOK AND THINK AT OUR LEISURE
WE HAVE GLIMPSES HERE AND THERE
AND YONDER THROUGH THE DIM CATHEDRAL TWILIGHT OF PORTIONS OF MANY
GALLERIES AND BALCONIES WEDGED FULL WITH OTHER PEOPLE THE OTHER
PORTIONS OF THESE GALLERIES AND BALCONIES BEING CUT OFF FROM SIGHT BY
INTERVENING PILLARS AND ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTIONS
WE HAVE IN VIEW
THE WHOLE OF THE GREAT NORTH TRANSEPT EMPTY AND WAITING FOR ENGLAND'S
PRIVILEGED ONES
WE SEE ALSO THE AMPLE AREA OR PLATFORM CARPETED WITH
RICH STUFFS WHEREON THE THRONE STANDS
THE THRONE OCCUPIES THE CENTRE
OF THE PLATFORM AND IS RAISED ABOVE IT UPON AN ELEVATION OF FOUR STEPS
WITHIN THE SEAT OF THE THRONE IS ENCLOSED A ROUGH FLAT ROCK THE STONE
OF SCONE WHICH MANY GENERATIONS OF SCOTTISH KINGS SAT ON TO BE CROWNED
AND SO IT IN TIME BECAME HOLY ENOUGH TO ANSWER A LIKE PURPOSE FOR
ENGLISH MONARCHS
BOTH THE THRONE AND ITS FOOTSTOOL ARE COVERED WITH
CLOTH OF GOLD
STILLNESS REIGNS THE TORCHES BLINK DULLY THE TIME DRAGS HEAVILY
BUT AT LAST THE LAGGING DAYLIGHT ASSERTS ITSELF THE TORCHES ARE
EXTINGUISHED AND A MELLOW RADIANCE SUFFUSES THE GREAT SPACES
ALL
FEATURES OF THE NOBLE BUILDING ARE DISTINCT NOW BUT SOFT AND DREAMY
FOR THE SUN IS LIGHTLY VEILED WITH CLOUDS
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THE FIRST BREAK IN THE DROWSY MONOTONY OCCURS FOR ON
THE STROKE OF THIS HOUR THE FIRST PEERESS ENTERS THE TRANSEPT CLOTHED
LIKE SOLOMON FOR SPLENDOUR AND IS CONDUCTED TO HER APPOINTED PLACE
BY AN OFFICIAL CLAD IN SATINS AND VELVETS WHILST A DUPLICATE OF HIM
GATHERS UP THE LADY'S LONG TRAIN FOLLOWS AFTER AND WHEN THE LADY IS
SEATED ARRANGES THE TRAIN ACROSS HER LAP FOR HER
HE THEN PLACES HER
FOOTSTOOL ACCORDING TO HER DESIRE AFTER WHICH HE PUTS HER CORONET WHERE
IT WILL BE CONVENIENT TO HER HAND WHEN THE TIME FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS
CORONETING OF THE NOBLES SHALL ARRIVE
BY THIS TIME THE PEERESSES ARE FLOWING IN IN A GLITTERING STREAM AND
THE SATIN CLAD OFFICIALS ARE FLITTING AND GLINTING EVERYWHERE SEATING
THEM AND MAKING THEM COMFORTABLE
THE SCENE IS ANIMATED ENOUGH NOW
THERE IS STIR AND LIFE AND SHIFTING COLOUR EVERYWHERE
AFTER A TIME
QUIET REIGNS AGAIN FOR THE PEERESSES ARE ALL COME AND ARE ALL IN THEIR
PLACES A SOLID ACRE OR SUCH A MATTER OF HUMAN FLOWERS RESPLENDENT IN
VARIEGATED COLOURS AND FROSTED LIKE A MILKY WAY WITH DIAMONDS
THERE
ARE ALL AGES HERE BROWN WRINKLED WHITE HAIRED DOWAGERS WHO ARE ABLE
TO GO BACK AND STILL BACK DOWN THE STREAM OF TIME AND RECALL THE
CROWNING OF RICHARD III
AND THE TROUBLOUS DAYS OF THAT OLD FORGOTTEN
AGE AND THERE ARE HANDSOME MIDDLE AGED DAMES AND LOVELY AND GRACIOUS
YOUNG MATRONS AND GENTLE AND BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRLS WITH BEAMING EYES
AND FRESH COMPLEXIONS WHO MAY POSSIBLY PUT ON THEIR JEWELLED CORONETS
AWKWARDLY WHEN THE GREAT TIME COMES FOR THE MATTER WILL BE NEW TO
THEM AND THEIR EXCITEMENT WILL BE A SORE HINDRANCE
STILL THIS MAY
NOT HAPPEN FOR THE HAIR OF ALL THESE LADIES HAS BEEN ARRANGED WITH A
SPECIAL VIEW TO THE SWIFT AND SUCCESSFUL LODGING OF THE CROWN IN ITS
PLACE WHEN THE SIGNAL COMES
WE HAVE SEEN THAT THIS MASSED ARRAY OF PEERESSES IS SOWN THICK WITH
DIAMONDS AND WE ALSO SEE THAT IT IS A MARVELLOUS SPECTACLE BUT NOW WE
ARE ABOUT TO BE ASTONISHED IN EARNEST
ABOUT NINE THE CLOUDS SUDDENLY
BREAK AWAY AND A SHAFT OF SUNSHINE CLEAVES THE MELLOW ATMOSPHERE AND
DRIFTS SLOWLY ALONG THE RANKS OF LADIES AND EVERY RANK IT TOUCHES
FLAMES INTO A DAZZLING SPLENDOUR OF MANY COLOURED FIRES AND WE TINGLE
TO OUR FINGER TIPS WITH THE ELECTRIC THRILL THAT IS SHOT THROUGH US BY
THE SURPRISE AND THE BEAUTY OF THE SPECTACLE PRESENTLY A SPECIAL ENVOY
FROM SOME DISTANT CORNER OF THE ORIENT MARCHING WITH THE GENERAL BODY
OF FOREIGN AMBASSADORS CROSSES THIS BAR OF SUNSHINE AND WE CATCH OUR
BREATH THE GLORY THAT STREAMS AND FLASHES AND PALPITATES ABOUT HIM IS
SO OVERPOWERING FOR HE IS CRUSTED FROM HEAD TO HEEL WITH GEMS AND HIS
SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT SHOWERS A DANCING RADIANCE ALL AROUND HIM
LET US CHANGE THE TENSE FOR CONVENIENCE
THE TIME DRIFTED ALONG ONE
HOUR TWO HOURS TWO HOURS AND A HALF THEN THE DEEP BOOMING OF
ARTILLERY TOLD THAT THE KING AND HIS GRAND PROCESSION HAD ARRIVED AT
LAST SO THE WAITING MULTITUDE REJOICED
ALL KNEW THAT A FURTHER DELAY
MUST FOLLOW FOR THE KING MUST BE PREPARED AND ROBED FOR THE SOLEMN
CEREMONY BUT THIS DELAY WOULD BE PLEASANTLY OCCUPIED BY THE ASSEMBLING
OF THE PEERS OF THE REALM IN THEIR STATELY ROBES
THESE WERE CONDUCTED
CEREMONIOUSLY TO THEIR SEATS AND THEIR CORONETS PLACED CONVENIENTLY
AT HAND AND MEANWHILE THE MULTITUDE IN THE GALLERIES WERE ALIVE WITH
INTEREST FOR MOST OF THEM WERE BEHOLDING FOR THE FIRST TIME DUKES
EARLS AND BARONS WHOSE NAMES HAD BEEN HISTORICAL FOR FIVE HUNDRED
YEARS
WHEN ALL WERE FINALLY SEATED THE SPECTACLE FROM THE GALLERIES
AND ALL COIGNS OF VANTAGE WAS COMPLETE A GORGEOUS ONE TO LOOK UPON AND
TO REMEMBER
NOW THE ROBED AND MITRED GREAT HEADS OF THE CHURCH AND THEIR
ATTENDANTS FILED IN UPON THE PLATFORM AND TOOK THEIR APPOINTED PLACES
THESE WERE FOLLOWED BY THE LORD PROTECTOR AND OTHER GREAT OFFICIALS AND
THESE AGAIN BY A STEEL CLAD DETACHMENT OF THE GUARD
THERE WAS A WAITING PAUSE THEN AT A SIGNAL A TRIUMPHANT PEAL OF MUSIC
BURST FORTH AND TOM CANTY CLOTHED IN A LONG ROBE OF CLOTH OF GOLD
APPEARED AT A DOOR AND STEPPED UPON THE PLATFORM
THE ENTIRE MULTITUDE
ROSE AND THE CEREMONY OF THE RECOGNITION ENSUED
THEN A NOBLE ANTHEM SWEPT THE ABBEY WITH ITS RICH WAVES OF SOUND AND
THUS HERALDED AND WELCOMED TOM CANTY WAS CONDUCTED TO THE THRONE
THE ANCIENT CEREMONIES WENT ON WITH IMPRESSIVE SOLEMNITY WHILST THE
AUDIENCE GAZED AND AS THEY DREW NEARER AND NEARER TO COMPLETION TOM
CANTY GREW PALE AND STILL PALER AND A DEEP AND STEADILY DEEPENING WOE
AND DESPONDENCY SETTLED DOWN UPON HIS SPIRITS AND UPON HIS REMORSEFUL
HEART
AT LAST THE FINAL ACT WAS AT HAND
THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY LIFTED
UP THE CROWN OF ENGLAND FROM ITS CUSHION AND HELD IT OUT OVER THE
TREMBLING MOCK KING'S HEAD
IN THE SAME INSTANT A RAINBOW RADIANCE
FLASHED ALONG THE SPACIOUS TRANSEPT FOR WITH ONE IMPULSE EVERY
INDIVIDUAL IN THE GREAT CONCOURSE OF NOBLES LIFTED A CORONET AND POISED
IT OVER HIS OR HER HEAD AND PAUSED IN THAT ATTITUDE
A DEEP HUSH PERVADED THE ABBEY
AT THIS IMPRESSIVE MOMENT A STARTLING
APPARITION INTRUDED UPON THE SCENE AN APPARITION OBSERVED BY NONE IN
THE ABSORBED MULTITUDE UNTIL IT SUDDENLY APPEARED MOVING UP THE GREAT
CENTRAL AISLE
IT WAS A BOY BAREHEADED ILL SHOD AND CLOTHED IN
COARSE PLEBEIAN GARMENTS THAT WERE FALLING TO RAGS
HE RAISED HIS HAND
WITH A SOLEMNITY WHICH ILL COMPORTED WITH HIS SOILED AND SORRY ASPECT
AND DELIVERED THIS NOTE OF WARNING
I FORBID YOU TO SET THE CROWN OF ENGLAND UPON THAT FORFEITED HEAD
I
AM THE KING
IN AN INSTANT SEVERAL INDIGNANT HANDS WERE LAID UPON THE BOY BUT IN
THE SAME INSTANT TOM CANTY IN HIS REGAL VESTMENTS MADE A SWIFT STEP
FORWARD AND CRIED OUT IN A RINGING VOICE
LOOSE HIM AND FORBEAR HE IS THE KING
A SORT OF PANIC OF ASTONISHMENT SWEPT THE ASSEMBLAGE AND THEY PARTLY
ROSE IN THEIR PLACES AND STARED IN A BEWILDERED WAY AT ONE ANOTHER AND
AT THE CHIEF FIGURES IN THIS SCENE LIKE PERSONS WHO WONDERED WHETHER
THEY WERE AWAKE AND IN THEIR SENSES OR ASLEEP AND DREAMING
THE LORD
PROTECTOR WAS AS AMAZED AS THE REST BUT QUICKLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AND
EXCLAIMED IN A VOICE OF AUTHORITY
MIND NOT HIS MAJESTY HIS MALADY IS UPON HIM AGAIN SEIZE THE
VAGABOND
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBEYED BUT THE MOCK KING STAMPED HIS FOOT AND CRIED
OUT
ON YOUR PERIL TOUCH HIM NOT HE IS THE KING
THE HANDS WERE WITHHELD A PARALYSIS FELL UPON THE HOUSE NO ONE MOVED
NO ONE SPOKE INDEED NO ONE KNEW HOW TO ACT OR WHAT TO SAY IN SO
STRANGE AND SURPRISING AN EMERGENCY
WHILE ALL MINDS WERE STRUGGLING TO
RIGHT THEMSELVES THE BOY STILL MOVED STEADILY FORWARD WITH HIGH PORT
AND CONFIDENT MIEN HE HAD NEVER HALTED FROM THE BEGINNING AND WHILE
THE TANGLED MINDS STILL FLOUNDERED HELPLESSLY HE STEPPED UPON THE
PLATFORM AND THE MOCK KING RAN WITH A GLAD FACE TO MEET HIM AND FELL
ON HIS KNEES BEFORE HIM AND SAID
OH MY LORD THE KING LET POOR TOM CANTY BE FIRST TO SWEAR FEALTY TO
THEE AND SAY 'PUT ON THY CROWN AND ENTER INTO THINE OWN AGAIN
THE LORD PROTECTOR'S EYE FELL STERNLY UPON THE NEW COMER'S FACE BUT
STRAIGHTWAY THE STERNNESS VANISHED AWAY AND GAVE PLACE TO AN EXPRESSION
OF WONDERING SURPRISE
THIS THING HAPPENED ALSO TO THE OTHER GREAT
OFFICERS
THEY GLANCED AT EACH OTHER AND RETREATED A STEP BY A COMMON
AND UNCONSCIOUS IMPULSE
THE THOUGHT IN EACH MIND WAS THE SAME WHAT
A STRANGE RESEMBLANCE
THE LORD PROTECTOR REFLECTED A MOMENT OR TWO IN PERPLEXITY THEN HE
SAID WITH GRAVE RESPECTFULNESS
BY YOUR FAVOUR SIR I DESIRE TO ASK CERTAIN QUESTIONS WHICH
I WILL ANSWER THEM MY LORD
THE DUKE ASKED HIM MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COURT THE LATE KING THE
PRINCE THE PRINCESSES THE BOY ANSWERED THEM CORRECTLY AND WITHOUT
HESITATING
HE DESCRIBED THE ROOMS OF STATE IN THE PALACE THE LATE
KING'S APARTMENTS AND THOSE OF THE PRINCE OF WALES
IT WAS STRANGE IT WAS WONDERFUL YES IT WAS UNACCOUNTABLE SO ALL SAID
THAT HEARD IT
THE TIDE WAS BEGINNING TO TURN AND TOM CANTY'S HOPES TO
RUN HIGH WHEN THE LORD PROTECTOR SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID
IT IS TRUE IT IS MOST WONDERFUL BUT IT IS NO MORE THAN OUR LORD THE
KING LIKEWISE CAN DO THIS REMARK AND THIS REFERENCE TO HIMSELF AS
STILL THE KING SADDENED TOM CANTY AND HE FELT HIS HOPES CRUMBLING FROM
UNDER HIM
THESE ARE NOT PROOFS ADDED THE PROTECTOR
THE TIDE WAS TURNING VERY FAST NOW VERY FAST INDEED BUT IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION IT WAS LEAVING POOR TOM CANTY STRANDED ON THE THRONE
AND SWEEPING THE OTHER OUT TO SEA
THE LORD PROTECTOR COMMUNED WITH
HIMSELF SHOOK HIS HEAD THE THOUGHT FORCED ITSELF UPON HIM IT IS
PERILOUS TO THE STATE AND TO US ALL TO ENTERTAIN SO FATEFUL A RIDDLE AS
THIS IT COULD DIVIDE THE NATION AND UNDERMINE THE THRONE HE TURNED
AND SAID
SIR THOMAS ARREST THIS NO HOLD HIS FACE LIGHTED AND HE
CONFRONTED THE RAGGED CANDIDATE WITH THIS QUESTION
WHERE LIETH THE GREAT SEAL ANSWER ME THIS TRULY AND THE RIDDLE IS
UNRIDDLED FOR ONLY HE THAT WAS PRINCE OF WALES CAN SO ANSWER ON SO
TRIVIAL A THING HANG A THRONE AND A DYNASTY
IT WAS A LUCKY THOUGHT A HAPPY THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS SO CONSIDERED BY
THE GREAT OFFICIALS WAS MANIFESTED BY THE SILENT APPLAUSE THAT SHOT FROM
EYE TO EYE AROUND THEIR CIRCLE IN THE FORM OF BRIGHT APPROVING GLANCES
YES NONE BUT THE TRUE PRINCE COULD DISSOLVE THE STUBBORN MYSTERY OF THE
VANISHED GREAT SEAL THIS FORLORN LITTLE IMPOSTOR HAD BEEN TAUGHT HIS
LESSON WELL BUT HERE HIS TEACHINGS MUST FAIL FOR HIS TEACHER HIMSELF
COULD NOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION AH VERY GOOD VERY GOOD INDEED
NOW WE SHALL BE RID OF THIS TROUBLESOME AND PERILOUS BUSINESS IN
SHORT ORDER AND SO THEY NODDED INVISIBLY AND SMILED INWARDLY WITH
SATISFACTION AND LOOKED TO SEE THIS FOOLISH LAD STRICKEN WITH A PALSY
OF GUILTY CONFUSION
HOW SURPRISED THEY WERE THEN TO SEE NOTHING OF
THE SORT HAPPEN HOW THEY MARVELLED TO HEAR HIM ANSWER UP PROMPTLY IN A
CONFIDENT AND UNTROUBLED VOICE AND SAY
THERE IS NOUGHT IN THIS RIDDLE THAT IS DIFFICULT THEN WITHOUT SO
MUCH AS A BY YOUR LEAVE TO ANYBODY HE TURNED AND GAVE THIS COMMAND
WITH THE EASY MANNER OF ONE ACCUSTOMED TO DOING SUCH THINGS MY LORD
ST
JOHN GO YOU TO MY PRIVATE CABINET IN THE PALACE FOR NONE KNOWETH
THE PLACE BETTER THAN YOU AND CLOSE DOWN TO THE FLOOR IN THE LEFT
CORNER REMOTEST FROM THE DOOR THAT OPENS FROM THE ANTE CHAMBER YOU
SHALL FIND IN THE WALL A BRAZEN NAIL HEAD PRESS UPON IT AND A LITTLE
JEWEL CLOSET WILL FLY OPEN WHICH NOT EVEN YOU DO KNOW OF NO NOR
ANY SOUL ELSE IN ALL THE WORLD BUT ME AND THE TRUSTY ARTISAN THAT DID
CONTRIVE IT FOR ME
THE FIRST THING THAT FALLETH UNDER YOUR EYE WILL BE
THE GREAT SEAL FETCH IT HITHER
ALL THE COMPANY WONDERED AT THIS SPEECH AND WONDERED STILL MORE TO SEE
THE LITTLE MENDICANT PICK OUT THIS PEER WITHOUT HESITANCY OR APPARENT
FEAR OF MISTAKE AND CALL HIM BY NAME WITH SUCH A PLACIDLY CONVINCING
AIR OF HAVING KNOWN HIM ALL HIS LIFE
THE PEER WAS ALMOST SURPRISED
INTO OBEYING
HE EVEN MADE A MOVEMENT AS IF TO GO BUT QUICKLY
RECOVERED HIS TRANQUIL ATTITUDE AND CONFESSED HIS BLUNDER WITH A BLUSH
TOM CANTY TURNED UPON HIM AND SAID SHARPLY
WHY DOST THOU HESITATE HAST NOT HEARD THE KING'S COMMAND GO
THE LORD ST
JOHN MADE A DEEP OBEISANCE AND IT WAS OBSERVED THAT IT WAS
A SIGNIFICANTLY CAUTIOUS AND NON COMMITTAL ONE IT NOT BEING DELIVERED
AT EITHER OF THE KINGS BUT AT THE NEUTRAL GROUND ABOUT HALF WAY BETWEEN
THE TWO AND TOOK HIS LEAVE
NOW BEGAN A MOVEMENT OF THE GORGEOUS PARTICLES OF THAT OFFICIAL GROUP
WHICH WAS SLOW SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND YET STEADY AND PERSISTENT A
MOVEMENT SUCH AS IS OBSERVED IN A KALEIDOSCOPE THAT IS TURNED SLOWLY
WHEREBY THE COMPONENTS OF ONE SPLENDID CLUSTER FALL AWAY AND JOIN
THEMSELVES TO ANOTHER A MOVEMENT WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE IN THE
PRESENT CASE DISSOLVED THE GLITTERING CROWD THAT STOOD ABOUT TOM CANTY
AND CLUSTERED IT TOGETHER AGAIN IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE NEW COMER
TOM CANTY STOOD ALMOST ALONE
NOW ENSUED A BRIEF SEASON OF DEEP
SUSPENSE AND WAITING DURING WHICH EVEN THE FEW FAINT HEARTS STILL
REMAINING NEAR TOM CANTY GRADUALLY SCRAPED TOGETHER COURAGE ENOUGH TO
GLIDE ONE BY ONE OVER TO THE MAJORITY
SO AT LAST TOM CANTY IN HIS
ROYAL ROBES AND JEWELS STOOD WHOLLY ALONE AND ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD
A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE OCCUPYING AN ELOQUENT VACANCY
NOW THE LORD ST
JOHN WAS SEEN RETURNING
AS HE ADVANCED UP
THE MID AISLE THE INTEREST WAS SO INTENSE THAT THE LOW MURMUR OF
CONVERSATION IN THE GREAT ASSEMBLAGE DIED OUT AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY
A PROFOUND HUSH A BREATHLESS STILLNESS THROUGH WHICH HIS FOOTFALLS
PULSED WITH A DULL AND DISTANT SOUND
EVERY EYE WAS FASTENED UPON HIM
AS HE MOVED ALONG
HE REACHED THE PLATFORM PAUSED A MOMENT THEN MOVED
TOWARD TOM CANTY WITH A DEEP OBEISANCE AND SAID
SIRE THE SEAL IS NOT THERE
A MOB DOES NOT MELT AWAY FROM THE PRESENCE OF A PLAGUE PATIENT WITH MORE
HASTE THAN THE BAND OF PALLID AND TERRIFIED COURTIERS MELTED AWAY FROM
THE PRESENCE OF THE SHABBY LITTLE CLAIMANT OF THE CROWN
IN A MOMENT
HE STOOD ALL ALONE WITHOUT FRIEND OR SUPPORTER A TARGET UPON WHICH
WAS CONCENTRATED A BITTER FIRE OF SCORNFUL AND ANGRY LOOKS
THE LORD
PROTECTOR CALLED OUT FIERCELY
CAST THE BEGGAR INTO THE STREET AND SCOURGE HIM THROUGH THE TOWN THE
PALTRY KNAVE IS WORTH NO MORE CONSIDERATION
OFFICERS OF THE GUARD SPRANG FORWARD TO OBEY BUT TOM CANTY WAVED THEM
OFF AND SAID
BACK WHOSO TOUCHES HIM PERILS HIS LIFE
THE LORD PROTECTOR WAS PERPLEXED IN THE LAST DEGREE
HE SAID TO THE
LORD ST
JOHN
SEARCHED YOU WELL BUT IT BOOTS NOT TO ASK THAT
IT DOTH SEEM PASSING
STRANGE
LITTLE THINGS TRIFLES SLIP OUT OF ONE'S KEN AND ONE DOES
NOT THINK IT MATTER FOR SURPRISE BUT HOW SO BULKY A THING AS THE
SEAL OF ENGLAND CAN VANISH AWAY AND NO MAN BE ABLE TO GET TRACK OF IT
AGAIN A MASSY GOLDEN DISK
TOM CANTY WITH BEAMING EYES SPRANG FORWARD AND SHOUTED
HOLD THAT IS ENOUGH WAS IT ROUND AND THICK AND HAD IT LETTERS
AND DEVICES GRAVED UPON IT YES OH NOW I KNOW WHAT THIS GREAT SEAL
IS THAT THERE'S BEEN SUCH WORRY AND POTHER ABOUT
AN' YE HAD DESCRIBED
IT TO ME YE COULD HAVE HAD IT THREE WEEKS AGO
RIGHT WELL I KNOW WHERE
IT LIES BUT IT WAS NOT I THAT PUT IT THERE FIRST
WHO THEN MY LIEGE ASKED THE LORD PROTECTOR
HE THAT STANDS THERE THE RIGHTFUL KING OF ENGLAND
AND HE SHALL TELL
YOU HIMSELF WHERE IT LIES THEN YOU WILL BELIEVE HE KNEW IT OF HIS OWN
KNOWLEDGE
BETHINK THEE MY KING SPUR THY MEMORY IT WAS THE LAST THE
VERY LAST THING THOU DIDST THAT DAY BEFORE THOU DIDST RUSH FORTH FROM
THE PALACE CLOTHED IN MY RAGS TO PUNISH THE SOLDIER THAT INSULTED ME
A SILENCE ENSUED UNDISTURBED BY A MOVEMENT OR A WHISPER AND ALL EYES
WERE FIXED UPON THE NEW COMER WHO STOOD WITH BENT HEAD AND CORRUGATED
BROW GROPING IN HIS MEMORY AMONG A THRONGING MULTITUDE OF VALUELESS
RECOLLECTIONS FOR ONE SINGLE LITTLE ELUSIVE FACT WHICH FOUND WOULD
SEAT HIM UPON A THRONE UNFOUND WOULD LEAVE HIM AS HE WAS FOR GOOD AND
ALL A PAUPER AND AN OUTCAST
MOMENT AFTER MOMENT PASSED THE MOMENTS
BUILT THEMSELVES INTO MINUTES STILL THE BOY STRUGGLED SILENTLY ON AND
GAVE NO SIGN
BUT AT LAST HE HEAVED A SIGH SHOOK HIS HEAD SLOWLY AND
SAID WITH A TREMBLING LIP AND IN A DESPONDENT VOICE
I CALL THE SCENE BACK ALL OF IT BUT THE SEAL HATH NO PLACE IN IT
HE PAUSED THEN LOOKED UP AND SAID WITH GENTLE DIGNITY MY LORDS AND
GENTLEMEN IF YE WILL ROB YOUR RIGHTFUL SOVEREIGN OF HIS OWN FOR LACK OF
THIS EVIDENCE WHICH HE IS NOT ABLE TO FURNISH I MAY NOT STAY YE BEING
POWERLESS
BUT
OH FOLLY OH MADNESS MY KING CRIED TOM CANTY IN A PANIC
WAIT THINK DO NOT GIVE UP THE CAUSE IS NOT LOST NOR SHALL BE
NEITHER LIST TO WHAT I SAY FOLLOW EVERY WORD I AM GOING TO BRING THAT
MORNING BACK AGAIN EVERY HAP JUST AS IT HAPPENED
WE TALKED I TOLD
YOU OF MY SISTERS NAN AND BET AH YES YOU REMEMBER THAT AND ABOUT
MINE OLD GRANDAM AND THE ROUGH GAMES OF THE LADS OF OFFAL COURT YES
YOU REMEMBER THESE THINGS ALSO VERY WELL FOLLOW ME STILL YOU SHALL
RECALL EVERYTHING
YOU GAVE ME FOOD AND DRINK AND DID WITH PRINCELY
COURTESY SEND AWAY THE SERVANTS SO THAT MY LOW BREEDING MIGHT NOT SHAME
ME BEFORE THEM AH YES THIS ALSO YOU REMEMBER
AS TOM CHECKED OFF HIS DETAILS AND THE OTHER BOY NODDED HIS HEAD IN
RECOGNITION OF THEM THE GREAT AUDIENCE AND THE OFFICIALS STARED IN
PUZZLED WONDERMENT THE TALE SOUNDED LIKE TRUE HISTORY YET HOW COULD
THIS IMPOSSIBLE CONJUNCTION BETWEEN A PRINCE AND A BEGGAR BOY HAVE COME
ABOUT NEVER WAS A COMPANY OF PEOPLE SO PERPLEXED SO INTERESTED AND
SO STUPEFIED BEFORE
FOR A JEST MY PRINCE WE DID EXCHANGE GARMENTS
THEN WE STOOD BEFORE
A MIRROR AND SO ALIKE WERE WE THAT BOTH SAID IT SEEMED AS IF THERE HAD
BEEN NO CHANGE MADE YES YOU REMEMBER THAT
THEN YOU NOTICED THAT THE
SOLDIER HAD HURT MY HAND LOOK HERE IT IS I CANNOT YET EVEN WRITE WITH
IT THE FINGERS ARE SO STIFF
AT THIS YOUR HIGHNESS SPRANG UP VOWING
VENGEANCE UPON THAT SOLDIER AND RAN TOWARDS THE DOOR YOU PASSED A
TABLE THAT THING YOU CALL THE SEAL LAY ON THAT TABLE YOU SNATCHED
IT UP AND LOOKED EAGERLY ABOUT AS IF FOR A PLACE TO HIDE IT YOUR EYE
CAUGHT SIGHT OF
THERE 'TIS SUFFICIENT AND THE GOOD GOD BE THANKED EXCLAIMED THE
RAGGED CLAIMANT IN A MIGHTY EXCITEMENT
GO MY GOOD ST
JOHN IN AN
ARM PIECE OF THE MILANESE ARMOUR THAT HANGS ON THE WALL THOU'LT FIND
THE SEAL
RIGHT MY KING RIGHT CRIED TOM CANTY NOW THE SCEPTRE OF ENGLAND
IS THINE OWN AND IT WERE BETTER FOR HIM THAT WOULD DISPUTE IT THAT HE
HAD BEEN BORN DUMB GO MY LORD ST
JOHN GIVE THY FEET WINGS
THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE WAS ON ITS FEET NOW AND WELL NIGH OUT OF ITS MIND
WITH UNEASINESS APPREHENSION AND CONSUMING EXCITEMENT
ON THE FLOOR
AND ON THE PLATFORM A DEAFENING BUZZ OF FRANTIC CONVERSATION BURST
FORTH AND FOR SOME TIME NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING OR HEARD ANYTHING OR WAS
INTERESTED IN ANYTHING BUT WHAT HIS NEIGHBOUR WAS SHOUTING INTO HIS EAR
OR HE WAS SHOUTING INTO HIS NEIGHBOUR'S EAR
TIME NOBODY KNEW HOW MUCH
OF IT SWEPT BY UNHEEDED AND UNNOTED
AT LAST A SUDDEN HUSH FELL UPON
THE HOUSE AND IN THE SAME MOMENT ST
JOHN APPEARED UPON THE PLATFORM
AND HELD THE GREAT SEAL ALOFT IN HIS HAND
THEN SUCH A SHOUT WENT UP
LONG LIVE THE TRUE KING
FOR FIVE MINUTES THE AIR QUAKED WITH SHOUTS AND THE CRASH OF MUSICAL
INSTRUMENTS AND WAS WHITE WITH A STORM OF WAVING HANDKERCHIEFS AND
THROUGH IT ALL A RAGGED LAD THE MOST CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN ENGLAND
STOOD FLUSHED AND HAPPY AND PROUD IN THE CENTRE OF THE SPACIOUS
PLATFORM WITH THE GREAT VASSALS OF THE KINGDOM KNEELING AROUND HIM
THEN ALL ROSE AND TOM CANTY CRIED OUT
NOW O MY KING TAKE THESE REGAL GARMENTS BACK AND GIVE POOR TOM THY
SERVANT HIS SHREDS AND REMNANTS AGAIN
THE LORD PROTECTOR SPOKE UP
LET THE SMALL VARLET BE STRIPPED AND FLUNG INTO THE TOWER
BUT THE NEW KING THE TRUE KING SAID
I WILL NOT HAVE IT SO
BUT FOR HIM I HAD NOT GOT MY CROWN AGAIN NONE
SHALL LAY A HAND UPON HIM TO HARM HIM
AND AS FOR THEE MY GOOD UNCLE
MY LORD PROTECTOR THIS CONDUCT OF THINE IS NOT GRATEFUL TOWARD
THIS POOR LAD FOR I HEAR HE HATH MADE THEE A DUKE THE PROTECTOR
BLUSHED YET HE WAS NOT A KING WHEREFORE WHAT IS THY FINE TITLE
WORTH NOW TO MORROW YOU SHALL SUE TO ME THROUGH HIM FOR ITS
CONFIRMATION ELSE NO DUKE BUT A SIMPLE EARL SHALT THOU REMAIN
UNDER THIS REBUKE HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF SOMERSET RETIRED A LITTLE FROM
THE FRONT FOR THE MOMENT
THE KING TURNED TO TOM AND SAID KINDLY MY
POOR BOY HOW WAS IT THAT YOU COULD REMEMBER WHERE I HID THE SEAL WHEN I
COULD NOT REMEMBER IT MYSELF
AH MY KING THAT WAS EASY SINCE I USED IT DIVERS DAYS
USED IT YET COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHERE IT WAS
I DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THAT THEY WANTED
THEY DID NOT DESCRIBE IT
YOUR MAJESTY
THEN HOW USED YOU IT
THE RED BLOOD BEGAN TO STEAL UP INTO TOM'S CHEEKS AND HE DROPPED HIS
EYES AND WAS SILENT
SPEAK UP GOOD LAD AND FEAR NOTHING SAID THE KING
HOW USED YOU
THE GREAT SEAL OF ENGLAND
TOM STAMMERED A MOMENT IN A PATHETIC CONFUSION THEN GOT IT OUT
TO CRACK NUTS WITH
POOR CHILD THE AVALANCHE OF LAUGHTER THAT GREETED THIS NEARLY SWEPT HIM
OFF HIS FEET
BUT IF A DOUBT REMAINED IN ANY MIND THAT TOM CANTY WAS
NOT THE KING OF ENGLAND AND FAMILIAR WITH THE AUGUST APPURTENANCES OF
ROYALTY THIS REPLY DISPOSED OF IT UTTERLY
MEANTIME THE SUMPTUOUS ROBE OF STATE HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM TOM'S
SHOULDERS TO THE KING'S WHOSE RAGS WERE EFFECTUALLY HIDDEN FROM SIGHT
UNDER IT
THEN THE CORONATION CEREMONIES WERE RESUMED THE TRUE KING
WAS ANOINTED AND THE CROWN SET UPON HIS HEAD WHILST CANNON THUNDERED
THE NEWS TO THE CITY AND ALL LONDON SEEMED TO ROCK WITH APPLAUSE
CHAPTER XXXIII
EDWARD AS KING
MILES HENDON WAS PICTURESQUE ENOUGH BEFORE HE GOT INTO THE RIOT ON
LONDON BRIDGE HE WAS MORE SO WHEN HE GOT OUT OF IT
HE HAD BUT LITTLE
MONEY WHEN HE GOT IN NONE AT ALL WHEN HE GOT OUT
THE PICKPOCKETS HAD
STRIPPED HIM OF HIS LAST FARTHING
BUT NO MATTER SO HE FOUND HIS BOY
BEING A SOLDIER HE DID NOT GO AT
HIS TASK IN A RANDOM WAY BUT SET TO WORK FIRST OF ALL TO ARRANGE HIS
CAMPAIGN
WHAT WOULD THE BOY NATURALLY DO WHERE WOULD HE NATURALLY GO
WELL ARGUED MILES HE WOULD NATURALLY GO TO HIS FORMER HAUNTS FOR THAT
IS THE INSTINCT OF UNSOUND MINDS WHEN HOMELESS AND FORSAKEN AS WELL
AS OF SOUND ONES
WHEREABOUTS WERE HIS FORMER HAUNTS HIS RAGS
TAKEN TOGETHER WITH THE LOW VILLAIN WHO SEEMED TO KNOW HIM AND WHO EVEN
CLAIMED TO BE HIS FATHER INDICATED THAT HIS HOME WAS IN ONE OR ANOTHER
OF THE POOREST AND MEANEST DISTRICTS OF LONDON
WOULD THE SEARCH FOR
HIM BE DIFFICULT OR LONG NO IT WAS LIKELY TO BE EASY AND BRIEF
HE
WOULD NOT HUNT FOR THE BOY HE WOULD HUNT FOR A CROWD IN THE CENTRE OF
A BIG CROWD OR A LITTLE ONE SOONER OR LATER HE SHOULD FIND HIS POOR
LITTLE FRIEND SURE AND THE MANGY MOB WOULD BE ENTERTAINING ITSELF
WITH PESTERING AND AGGRAVATING THE BOY WHO WOULD BE PROCLAIMING HIMSELF
KING AS USUAL
THEN MILES HENDON WOULD CRIPPLE SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE
AND CARRY OFF HIS LITTLE WARD AND COMFORT AND CHEER HIM WITH LOVING
WORDS AND THE TWO WOULD NEVER BE SEPARATED ANY MORE
SO MILES STARTED ON HIS QUEST
HOUR AFTER HOUR HE TRAMPED THROUGH BACK
ALLEYS AND SQUALID STREETS SEEKING GROUPS AND CROWDS AND FINDING NO
END OF THEM BUT NEVER ANY SIGN OF THE BOY
THIS GREATLY SURPRISED HIM
BUT DID NOT DISCOURAGE HIM
TO HIS NOTION THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER
WITH HIS PLAN OF CAMPAIGN THE ONLY MISCALCULATION ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE
CAMPAIGN WAS BECOMING A LENGTHY ONE WHEREAS HE HAD EXPECTED IT TO BE
SHORT
WHEN DAYLIGHT ARRIVED AT LAST HE HAD MADE MANY A MILE AND CANVASSED
MANY A CROWD BUT THE ONLY RESULT WAS THAT HE WAS TOLERABLY TIRED
RATHER HUNGRY AND VERY SLEEPY
HE WANTED SOME BREAKFAST BUT THERE WAS
NO WAY TO GET IT
TO BEG FOR IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM AS TO PAWNING
HIS SWORD HE WOULD AS SOON HAVE THOUGHT OF PARTING WITH HIS HONOUR
HE COULD SPARE SOME OF HIS CLOTHES YES BUT ONE COULD AS EASILY FIND A
CUSTOMER FOR A DISEASE AS FOR SUCH CLOTHES
AT NOON HE WAS STILL TRAMPING AMONG THE RABBLE WHICH FOLLOWED AFTER
THE ROYAL PROCESSION NOW FOR HE ARGUED THAT THIS REGAL DISPLAY WOULD
ATTRACT HIS LITTLE LUNATIC POWERFULLY
HE FOLLOWED THE PAGEANT THROUGH
ALL ITS DEVIOUS WINDINGS ABOUT LONDON AND ALL THE WAY TO WESTMINSTER
AND THE ABBEY
HE DRIFTED HERE AND THERE AMONGST THE MULTITUDES
THAT WERE MASSED IN THE VICINITY FOR A WEARY LONG TIME BAFFLED AND
PERPLEXED AND FINALLY WANDERED OFF THINKING AND TRYING TO CONTRIVE
SOME WAY TO BETTER HIS PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
BY AND BY WHEN HE CAME TO
HIMSELF OUT OF HIS MUSINGS HE DISCOVERED THAT THE TOWN WAS FAR BEHIND
HIM AND THAT THE DAY WAS GROWING OLD
HE WAS NEAR THE RIVER AND IN THE
COUNTRY IT WAS A REGION OF FINE RURAL SEATS NOT THE SORT OF DISTRICT
TO WELCOME CLOTHES LIKE HIS
IT WAS NOT AT ALL COLD SO HE STRETCHED HIMSELF ON THE GROUND IN THE LEE
OF A HEDGE TO REST AND THINK
DROWSINESS PRESENTLY BEGAN TO SETTLE UPON
HIS SENSES THE FAINT AND FAR OFF BOOM OF CANNON WAS WAFTED TO HIS EAR
AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE NEW KING IS CROWNED AND STRAIGHTWAY FELL
ASLEEP
HE HAD NOT SLEPT OR RESTED BEFORE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY HOURS
HE DID NOT WAKE AGAIN UNTIL NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT MORNING
HE GOT UP LAME STIFF AND HALF FAMISHED WASHED HIMSELF IN THE RIVER
STAYED HIS STOMACH WITH A PINT OR TWO OF WATER AND TRUDGED OFF TOWARD
WESTMINSTER GRUMBLING AT HIMSELF FOR HAVING WASTED SO MUCH TIME
HUNGER HELPED HIM TO A NEW PLAN NOW HE WOULD TRY TO GET SPEECH WITH
OLD SIR HUMPHREY MARLOW AND BORROW A FEW MARKS AND BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
OF A PLAN FOR THE PRESENT IT WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH TO ENLARGE IT WHEN
THIS FIRST STAGE SHOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED
TOWARD ELEVEN O'CLOCK HE APPROACHED THE PALACE AND ALTHOUGH A HOST OF
SHOWY PEOPLE WERE ABOUT HIM MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION HE WAS NOT
INCONSPICUOUS HIS COSTUME TOOK CARE OF THAT
HE WATCHED THESE PEOPLE'S
FACES NARROWLY HOPING TO FIND A CHARITABLE ONE WHOSE POSSESSOR MIGHT
BE WILLING TO CARRY HIS NAME TO THE OLD LIEUTENANT AS TO TRYING TO GET
INTO THE PALACE HIMSELF THAT WAS SIMPLY OUT OF THE QUESTION
PRESENTLY OUR WHIPPING BOY PASSED HIM THEN WHEELED ABOUT AND SCANNED
HIS FIGURE WELL SAYING TO HIMSELF AN' THAT IS NOT THE VERY VAGABOND
HIS MAJESTY IS IN SUCH A WORRY ABOUT THEN AM I AN ASS THOUGH BELIKE I
WAS THAT BEFORE
HE ANSWERETH THE DESCRIPTION TO A RAG THAT GOD SHOULD
MAKE TWO SUCH WOULD BE TO CHEAPEN MIRACLES BY WASTEFUL REPETITION
I
WOULD I COULD CONTRIVE AN EXCUSE TO SPEAK WITH HIM
MILES HENDON SAVED HIM THE TROUBLE FOR HE TURNED ABOUT THEN AS A MAN
GENERALLY WILL WHEN SOMEBODY MESMERISES HIM BY GAZING HARD AT HIM FROM
BEHIND AND OBSERVING A STRONG INTEREST IN THE BOY'S EYES HE STEPPED
TOWARD HIM AND SAID
YOU HAVE JUST COME OUT FROM THE PALACE DO YOU BELONG THERE
YES YOUR WORSHIP
KNOW YOU SIR HUMPHREY MARLOW
THE BOY STARTED AND SAID TO HIMSELF LORD MINE OLD DEPARTED FATHER
THEN HE ANSWERED ALOUD RIGHT WELL YOUR WORSHIP
GOOD IS HE WITHIN
YES SAID THE BOY AND ADDED TO HIMSELF WITHIN HIS GRAVE
MIGHT I CRAVE YOUR FAVOUR TO CARRY MY NAME TO HIM AND SAY I BEG TO SAY
A WORD IN HIS EAR
I WILL DESPATCH THE BUSINESS RIGHT WILLINGLY FAIR SIR
THEN SAY MILES HENDON SON OF SIR RICHARD IS HERE WITHOUT I SHALL BE
GREATLY BOUNDEN TO YOU MY GOOD LAD
THE BOY LOOKED DISAPPOINTED
THE KING DID NOT NAME HIM SO HE SAID TO
HIMSELF BUT IT MATTERETH NOT THIS IS HIS TWIN BROTHER AND CAN GIVE
HIS MAJESTY NEWS OF T'OTHER SIR ODDS AND ENDS I WARRANT SO HE SAID
TO MILES STEP IN THERE A MOMENT GOOD SIR AND WAIT TILL I BRING YOU
WORD
HENDON RETIRED TO THE PLACE INDICATED IT WAS A RECESS SUNK IN THE
PALACE WALL WITH A STONE BENCH IN IT A SHELTER FOR SENTINELS IN BAD
WEATHER
HE HAD HARDLY SEATED HIMSELF WHEN SOME HALBERDIERS IN CHARGE
OF AN OFFICER PASSED BY
THE OFFICER SAW HIM HALTED HIS MEN AND
COMMANDED HENDON TO COME FORTH
HE OBEYED AND WAS PROMPTLY ARRESTED
AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER PROWLING WITHIN THE PRECINCTS OF THE PALACE
THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK UGLY
POOR MILES WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN BUT THE
OFFICER ROUGHLY SILENCED HIM AND ORDERED HIS MEN TO DISARM HIM AND
SEARCH HIM
GOD OF HIS MERCY GRANT THAT THEY FIND SOMEWHAT SAID POOR MILES I
HAVE SEARCHED ENOW AND FAILED YET IS MY NEED GREATER THAN THEIRS
NOTHING WAS FOUND BUT A DOCUMENT
THE OFFICER TORE IT OPEN AND HENDON
SMILED WHEN HE RECOGNISED THE 'POT HOOKS' MADE BY HIS LOST LITTLE FRIEND
THAT BLACK DAY AT HENDON HALL
THE OFFICER'S FACE GREW DARK AS HE READ
THE ENGLISH PARAGRAPH AND MILES BLENCHED TO THE OPPOSITE COLOUR AS HE
LISTENED
ANOTHER NEW CLAIMANT OF THE CROWN CRIED THE OFFICER
VERILY THEY
BREED LIKE RABBITS TO DAY
SEIZE THE RASCAL MEN AND SEE YE KEEP
HIM FAST WHILST I CONVEY THIS PRECIOUS PAPER WITHIN AND SEND IT TO THE
KING
HE HURRIED AWAY LEAVING THE PRISONER IN THE GRIP OF THE HALBERDIERS
NOW IS MY EVIL LUCK ENDED AT LAST MUTTERED HENDON FOR I SHALL
DANGLE AT A ROPE'S END FOR A CERTAINTY BY REASON OF THAT BIT OF
WRITING
AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF MY POOR LAD AH ONLY THE GOOD GOD
KNOWETH
BY AND BY HE SAW THE OFFICER COMING AGAIN IN A GREAT HURRY SO HE
PLUCKED HIS COURAGE TOGETHER PURPOSING TO MEET HIS TROUBLE AS BECAME A
MAN
THE OFFICER ORDERED THE MEN TO LOOSE THE PRISONER AND RETURN HIS
SWORD TO HIM THEN BOWED RESPECTFULLY AND SAID
PLEASE YOU SIR TO FOLLOW ME
HENDON FOLLOWED SAYING TO HIMSELF AN' I WERE NOT TRAVELLING TO DEATH
AND JUDGMENT AND SO MUST NEEDS ECONOMISE IN SIN I WOULD THROTTLE THIS
KNAVE FOR HIS MOCK COURTESY
THE TWO TRAVERSED A POPULOUS COURT AND ARRIVED AT THE GRAND ENTRANCE OF
THE PALACE WHERE THE OFFICER WITH ANOTHER BOW DELIVERED HENDON INTO
THE HANDS OF A GORGEOUS OFFICIAL WHO RECEIVED HIM WITH PROFOUND RESPECT
AND LED HIM FORWARD THROUGH A GREAT HALL LINED ON BOTH SIDES WITH ROWS
OF SPLENDID FLUNKEYS WHO MADE REVERENTIAL OBEISANCE AS THE TWO PASSED
ALONG BUT FELL INTO DEATH THROES OF SILENT LAUGHTER AT OUR STATELY
SCARECROW THE MOMENT HIS BACK WAS TURNED AND UP A BROAD STAIRCASE
AMONG FLOCKS OF FINE FOLK AND FINALLY CONDUCTED HIM INTO A VAST ROOM
CLOVE A PASSAGE FOR HIM THROUGH THE ASSEMBLED NOBILITY OF ENGLAND THEN
MADE A BOW REMINDED HIM TO TAKE HIS HAT OFF AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM A MARK FOR ALL EYES FOR PLENTY OF INDIGNANT
FROWNS AND FOR A SUFFICIENCY OF AMUSED AND DERISIVE SMILES
MILES HENDON WAS ENTIRELY BEWILDERED
THERE SAT THE YOUNG KING UNDER
A CANOPY OF STATE FIVE STEPS AWAY WITH HIS HEAD BENT DOWN AND ASIDE
SPEAKING WITH A SORT OF HUMAN BIRD OF PARADISE A DUKE MAYBE
HENDON
OBSERVED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS HARD ENOUGH TO BE SENTENCED TO DEATH
IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF LIFE WITHOUT HAVING THIS PECULIARLY PUBLIC
HUMILIATION ADDED
HE WISHED THE KING WOULD HURRY ABOUT IT SOME OF THE
GAUDY PEOPLE NEAR BY WERE BECOMING PRETTY OFFENSIVE
AT THIS MOMENT
THE KING RAISED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY AND HENDON CAUGHT A GOOD VIEW OF HIS
FACE
THE SIGHT NEARLY TOOK HIS BREATH AWAY HE STOOD GAZING AT THE
FAIR YOUNG FACE LIKE ONE TRANSFIXED THEN PRESENTLY EJACULATED
LO THE LORD OF THE KINGDOM OF DREAMS AND SHADOWS ON HIS THRONE
HE MUTTERED SOME BROKEN SENTENCES STILL GAZING AND MARVELLING THEN
TURNED HIS EYES AROUND AND ABOUT SCANNING THE GORGEOUS THRONG AND THE
SPLENDID SALOON MURMURING BUT THESE ARE REAL VERILY THESE ARE
REAL SURELY IT IS NOT A DREAM
HE STARED AT THE KING AGAIN AND THOUGHT IS IT A DREAM
OR IS
HE THE VERITABLE SOVEREIGN OF ENGLAND AND NOT THE FRIENDLESS POOR TOM
O' BEDLAM I TOOK HIM FOR WHO SHALL SOLVE ME THIS RIDDLE
A SUDDEN IDEA FLASHED IN HIS EYE AND HE STRODE TO THE WALL GATHERED UP
A CHAIR BROUGHT IT BACK PLANTED IT ON THE FLOOR AND SAT DOWN IN IT
A BUZZ OF INDIGNATION BROKE OUT A ROUGH HAND WAS LAID UPON HIM AND A
VOICE EXCLAIMED
UP THOU MANNERLESS CLOWN WOULD'ST SIT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
THE DISTURBANCE ATTRACTED HIS MAJESTY'S ATTENTION WHO STRETCHED FORTH
HIS HAND AND CRIED OUT
TOUCH HIM NOT IT IS HIS RIGHT
THE THRONG FELL BACK STUPEFIED
THE KING WENT ON
LEARN YE ALL LADIES LORDS AND GENTLEMEN THAT THIS IS MY TRUSTY AND
WELL BELOVED SERVANT MILES HENDON WHO INTERPOSED HIS GOOD SWORD AND
SAVED HIS PRINCE FROM BODILY HARM AND POSSIBLE DEATH AND FOR THIS HE IS
A KNIGHT BY THE KING'S VOICE
ALSO LEARN THAT FOR A HIGHER SERVICE
IN THAT HE SAVED HIS SOVEREIGN STRIPES AND SHAME TAKING THESE UPON
HIMSELF HE IS A PEER OF ENGLAND EARL OF KENT AND SHALL HAVE GOLD
AND LANDS MEET FOR THE DIGNITY
MORE THE PRIVILEGE WHICH HE HATH JUST
EXERCISED IS HIS BY ROYAL GRANT FOR WE HAVE ORDAINED THAT THE CHIEFS
OF HIS LINE SHALL HAVE AND HOLD THE RIGHT TO SIT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
MAJESTY OF ENGLAND HENCEFORTH AGE AFTER AGE SO LONG AS THE CROWN SHALL
ENDURE
MOLEST HIM NOT
TWO PERSONS WHO THROUGH DELAY HAD ONLY ARRIVED FROM THE COUNTRY
DURING THIS MORNING AND HAD NOW BEEN IN THIS ROOM ONLY FIVE MINUTES
STOOD LISTENING TO THESE WORDS AND LOOKING AT THE KING THEN AT THE
SCARECROW THEN AT THE KING AGAIN IN A SORT OF TORPID BEWILDERMENT
THESE WERE SIR HUGH AND THE LADY EDITH
BUT THE NEW EARL DID NOT
SEE THEM
HE WAS STILL STARING AT THE MONARCH IN A DAZED WAY AND
MUTTERING
OH BODY O' ME THIS MY PAUPER THIS MY LUNATIC THIS IS HE WHOM
I WOULD SHOW WHAT GRANDEUR WAS IN MY HOUSE OF SEVENTY ROOMS AND
SEVEN AND TWENTY SERVANTS THIS IS HE WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN AUGHT BUT
RAGS FOR RAIMENT KICKS FOR COMFORT AND OFFAL FOR DIET THIS IS HE
WHOM I ADOPTED AND WOULD MAKE RESPECTABLE WOULD GOD I HAD A BAG TO
HIDE MY HEAD IN
THEN HIS MANNERS SUDDENLY CAME BACK TO HIM AND HE DROPPED UPON HIS
KNEES WITH HIS HANDS BETWEEN THE KING'S AND SWORE ALLEGIANCE AND DID
HOMAGE FOR HIS LANDS AND TITLES
THEN HE ROSE AND STOOD RESPECTFULLY
ASIDE A MARK STILL FOR ALL EYES AND MUCH ENVY TOO
NOW THE KING DISCOVERED SIR HUGH AND SPOKE OUT WITH WRATHFUL VOICE AND
KINDLING EYE
STRIP THIS ROBBER OF HIS FALSE SHOW AND STOLEN ESTATES AND PUT HIM
UNDER LOCK AND KEY TILL I HAVE NEED OF HIM
THE LATE SIR HUGH WAS LED AWAY
THERE WAS A STIR AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM NOW THE ASSEMBLAGE FELL
APART AND TOM CANTY QUAINTLY BUT RICHLY CLOTHED MARCHED DOWN BETWEEN
THESE LIVING WALLS PRECEDED BY AN USHER
HE KNELT BEFORE THE KING WHO
SAID
I HAVE LEARNED THE STORY OF THESE PAST FEW WEEKS AND AM WELL PLEASED
WITH THEE
THOU HAST GOVERNED THE REALM WITH RIGHT ROYAL GENTLENESS AND
MERCY
THOU HAST FOUND THY MOTHER AND THY SISTERS AGAIN GOOD THEY
SHALL BE CARED FOR AND THY FATHER SHALL HANG IF THOU DESIRE IT AND THE
LAW CONSENT
KNOW ALL YE THAT HEAR MY VOICE THAT FROM THIS DAY THEY
THAT ABIDE IN THE SHELTER OF CHRIST'S HOSPITAL AND SHARE THE KING'S
BOUNTY SHALL HAVE THEIR MINDS AND HEARTS FED AS WELL AS THEIR BASER
PARTS AND THIS BOY SHALL DWELL THERE AND HOLD THE CHIEF PLACE IN ITS
HONOURABLE BODY OF GOVERNORS DURING LIFE
AND FOR THAT HE HATH BEEN
A KING IT IS MEET THAT OTHER THAN COMMON OBSERVANCE SHALL BE HIS DUE
WHEREFORE NOTE THIS HIS DRESS OF STATE FOR BY IT HE SHALL BE KNOWN AND
NONE SHALL COPY IT AND WHERESOEVER HE SHALL COME IT SHALL REMIND THE
PEOPLE THAT HE HATH BEEN ROYAL IN HIS TIME AND NONE SHALL DENY HIM HIS
DUE OF REVERENCE OR FAIL TO GIVE HIM SALUTATION
HE HATH THE THRONE'S
PROTECTION HE HATH THE CROWN'S SUPPORT HE SHALL BE KNOWN AND CALLED BY
THE HONOURABLE TITLE OF THE KING'S WARD
THE PROUD AND HAPPY TOM CANTY ROSE AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND WAS
CONDUCTED FROM THE PRESENCE
HE DID NOT WASTE ANY TIME BUT FLEW TO HIS
MOTHER TO TELL HER AND NAN AND BET ALL ABOUT IT AND GET THEM TO HELP
HIM ENJOY THE GREAT NEWS

CONCLUSION
JUSTICE AND RETRIBUTION
WHEN THE MYSTERIES WERE ALL CLEARED UP IT CAME OUT BY CONFESSION OF
HUGH HENDON THAT HIS WIFE HAD REPUDIATED MILES BY HIS COMMAND THAT
DAY AT HENDON HALL A COMMAND ASSISTED AND SUPPORTED BY THE PERFECTLY
TRUSTWORTHY PROMISE THAT IF SHE DID NOT DENY THAT HE WAS MILES HENDON
AND STAND FIRMLY TO IT HE WOULD HAVE HER LIFE WHEREUPON SHE SAID
TAKE IT SHE DID NOT VALUE IT AND SHE WOULD NOT REPUDIATE
MILES THEN THE HUSBAND SAID HE WOULD SPARE HER LIFE BUT HAVE MILES
ASSASSINATED THIS WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER SO SHE GAVE HER WORD AND
KEPT IT
HUGH WAS NOT PROSECUTED FOR HIS THREATS OR FOR STEALING HIS BROTHER'S
ESTATES AND TITLE BECAUSE THE WIFE AND BROTHER WOULD NOT TESTIFY
AGAINST HIM AND THE FORMER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO DO IT EVEN
IF SHE HAD WANTED TO
HUGH DESERTED HIS WIFE AND WENT OVER TO THE
CONTINENT WHERE HE PRESENTLY DIED AND BY AND BY THE EARL OF KENT
MARRIED HIS RELICT
THERE WERE GRAND TIMES AND REJOICINGS AT HENDON
VILLAGE WHEN THE COUPLE PAID THEIR FIRST VISIT TO THE HALL
TOM CANTY'S FATHER WAS NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN
THE KING SOUGHT OUT THE FARMER WHO HAD BEEN BRANDED AND SOLD AS A SLAVE
AND RECLAIMED HIM FROM HIS EVIL LIFE WITH THE RUFFLER'S GANG AND PUT
HIM IN THE WAY OF A COMFORTABLE LIVELIHOOD
HE ALSO TOOK THAT OLD LAWYER OUT OF PRISON AND REMITTED HIS FINE
HE
PROVIDED GOOD HOMES FOR THE DAUGHTERS OF THE TWO BAPTIST WOMEN WHOM HE
SAW BURNED AT THE STAKE AND ROUNDLY PUNISHED THE OFFICIAL WHO LAID THE
UNDESERVED STRIPES UPON MILES HENDON'S BACK
HE SAVED FROM THE GALLOWS THE BOY WHO HAD CAPTURED THE STRAY FALCON AND
ALSO THE WOMAN WHO HAD STOLEN A REMNANT OF CLOTH FROM A WEAVER BUT HE
WAS TOO LATE TO SAVE THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF KILLING A DEER IN
THE ROYAL FOREST
HE SHOWED FAVOUR TO THE JUSTICE WHO HAD PITIED HIM WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE STOLEN A PIG AND HE HAD THE GRATIFICATION OF SEEING HIM GROW IN
THE PUBLIC ESTEEM AND BECOME A GREAT AND HONOURED MAN
AS LONG AS THE KING LIVED HE WAS FOND OF TELLING THE STORY OF HIS
ADVENTURES ALL THROUGH FROM THE HOUR THAT THE SENTINEL CUFFED HIM
AWAY FROM THE PALACE GATE TILL THE FINAL MIDNIGHT WHEN HE DEFTLY MIXED
HIMSELF INTO A GANG OF HURRYING WORKMEN AND SO SLIPPED INTO THE ABBEY
AND CLIMBED UP AND HID HIMSELF IN THE CONFESSOR'S TOMB AND THEN SLEPT
SO LONG NEXT DAY THAT HE CAME WITHIN ONE OF MISSING THE CORONATION
ALTOGETHER
HE SAID THAT THE FREQUENT REHEARSING OF THE PRECIOUS LESSON
KEPT HIM STRONG IN HIS PURPOSE TO MAKE ITS TEACHINGS YIELD BENEFITS TO
HIS PEOPLE AND SO WHILST HIS LIFE WAS SPARED HE SHOULD CONTINUE TO
TELL THE STORY AND THUS KEEP ITS SORROWFUL SPECTACLES FRESH IN HIS
MEMORY AND THE SPRINGS OF PITY REPLENISHED IN HIS HEART
MILES HENDON AND TOM CANTY WERE FAVOURITES OF THE KING ALL THROUGH HIS
BRIEF REIGN AND HIS SINCERE MOURNERS WHEN HE DIED
THE GOOD EARL
OF KENT HAD TOO MUCH SENSE TO ABUSE HIS PECULIAR PRIVILEGE BUT HE
EXERCISED IT TWICE AFTER THE INSTANCE WE HAVE SEEN OF IT BEFORE HE WAS
CALLED FROM THIS WORLD ONCE AT THE ACCESSION OF QUEEN MARY AND ONCE AT
THE ACCESSION OF QUEEN ELIZABETH
A DESCENDANT OF HIS EXERCISED IT
AT THE ACCESSION OF JAMES I
BEFORE THIS ONE'S SON CHOSE TO USE THE
PRIVILEGE NEAR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY HAD ELAPSED AND THE 'PRIVILEGE
OF THE KENTS' HAD FADED OUT OF MOST PEOPLE'S MEMORIES SO WHEN THE KENT
OF THAT DAY APPEARED BEFORE CHARLES I
AND HIS COURT AND SAT DOWN IN THE
SOVEREIGN'S PRESENCE TO ASSERT AND PERPETUATE THE RIGHT OF HIS HOUSE
THERE WAS A FINE STIR INDEED BUT THE MATTER WAS SOON EXPLAINED AND
THE RIGHT CONFIRMED
THE LAST EARL OF THE LINE FELL IN THE WARS OF THE
COMMONWEALTH FIGHTING FOR THE KING AND THE ODD PRIVILEGE ENDED WITH
HIM
TOM CANTY LIVED TO BE A VERY OLD MAN A HANDSOME WHITE HAIRED OLD
FELLOW OF GRAVE AND BENIGNANT ASPECT
AS LONG AS HE LASTED HE WAS
HONOURED AND HE WAS ALSO REVERENCED FOR HIS STRIKING AND PECULIAR
COSTUME KEPT THE PEOPLE REMINDED THAT 'IN HIS TIME HE HAD BEEN ROYAL
SO WHEREVER HE APPEARED THE CROWD FELL APART MAKING WAY FOR HIM AND
WHISPERING ONE TO ANOTHER DOFF THY HAT IT IS THE KING'S WARD AND
SO THEY SALUTED AND GOT HIS KINDLY SMILE IN RETURN AND THEY VALUED IT
TOO FOR HIS WAS AN HONOURABLE HISTORY
YES KING EDWARD VI
LIVED ONLY A FEW YEARS POOR BOY BUT HE LIVED THEM
WORTHILY
MORE THAN ONCE WHEN SOME GREAT DIGNITARY SOME GILDED VASSAL
OF THE CROWN MADE ARGUMENT AGAINST HIS LENIENCY AND URGED THAT SOME
LAW WHICH HE WAS BENT UPON AMENDING WAS GENTLE ENOUGH FOR ITS PURPOSE
AND WROUGHT NO SUFFERING OR OPPRESSION WHICH ANY ONE NEED MIGHTILY MIND
THE YOUNG KING TURNED THE MOURNFUL ELOQUENCE OF HIS GREAT COMPASSIONATE
EYES UPON HIM AND ANSWERED
WHAT DOST THOU KNOW OF SUFFERING AND OPPRESSION I AND MY PEOPLE
KNOW BUT NOT THOU
THE REIGN OF EDWARD VI
WAS A SINGULARLY MERCIFUL ONE FOR THOSE HARSH
TIMES
NOW THAT WE ARE TAKING LEAVE OF HIM LET US TRY TO KEEP THIS IN

ONE HEARS MUCH ABOUT THE 'HIDEOUS BLUE LAWS OF CONNECTICUT AND IS
ACCUSTOMED TO SHUDDER PIOUSLY WHEN THEY ARE MENTIONED
THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN AMERICA AND EVEN IN ENGLAND WHO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE A VERY
MONUMENT OF MALIGNITY PITILESSNESS AND INHUMANITY WHEREAS IN REALITY
THEY WERE ABOUT THE FIRST SWEEPING DEPARTURE FROM JUDICIAL ATROCITY
WHICH THE 'CIVILISED' WORLD HAD SEEN
THIS HUMANE AND KINDLY BLUE LAW
CODE OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS AGO STANDS ALL BY ITSELF
WITH AGES OF BLOODY LAW ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF IT AND A CENTURY AND
THREE QUARTERS OF BLOODY ENGLISH LAW ON THIS SIDE OF IT
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME UNDER THE BLUE LAWS OR ANY OTHER WHEN
ABOVE FOURTEEN CRIMES WERE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH IN CONNECTICUT
BUT IN
ENGLAND WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MEN WHO ARE STILL HALE IN BODY AND MIND
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE CRIMES WERE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH 10

THE 'BODY OF THE NATION'
BUT THE BASIN OF THE MISSISSIPPI IS THE BODY OF THE NATION
ALL THE
OTHER PARTS ARE BUT MEMBERS IMPORTANT IN THEMSELVES YET MORE IMPORTANT
IN THEIR RELATIONS TO THIS
EXCLUSIVE OF THE LAKE BASIN AND OF 300 000
SQUARE MILES IN TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO WHICH IN MANY ASPECTS FORM A PART
OF IT THIS BASIN CONTAINS ABOUT 1 250 000 SQUARE MILES
IN EXTENT IT IS
THE SECOND GREAT VALLEY OF THE WORLD BEING EXCEEDED ONLY BY THAT OF THE
AMAZON
THE VALLEY OF THE FROZEN OBI APPROACHES IT IN EXTENT THAT OF
LA PLATA COMES NEXT IN SPACE AND PROBABLY IN HABITABLE CAPACITY HAVING
ABOUT EIGHT NINTHS OF ITS AREA THEN COMES THAT OF THE YENISEI WITH
ABOUT SEVEN NINTHS THE LENA AMOOR HOANG HO YANG TSE KIANG AND
NILE FIVE NINTHS THE GANGES LESS THAN ONE HALF THE INDUS LESS
THAN ONE THIRD THE EUPHRATES ONE FIFTH THE RHINE ONE FIFTEENTH
IT
EXCEEDS IN EXTENT THE WHOLE OF EUROPE EXCLUSIVE OF RUSSIA NORWAY
AND SWEDEN
IT WOULD CONTAIN AUSTRIA FOUR TIMES GERMANY OR SPAIN
FIVE TIMES FRANCE SIX TIMES THE BRITISH ISLANDS OR ITALY TEN TIMES
CONCEPTIONS FORMED FROM THE RIVER BASINS OF WESTERN EUROPE ARE RUDELY
SHOCKED WHEN WE CONSIDER THE EXTENT OF THE VALLEY OF THE MISSISSIPPI
NOR ARE THOSE FORMED FROM THE STERILE BASINS OF THE GREAT RIVERS OF
SIBERIA THE LOFTY PLATEAUS OF CENTRAL ASIA OR THE MIGHTY SWEEP OF
THE SWAMPY AMAZON MORE ADEQUATE
LATITUDE ELEVATION AND RAINFALL
ALL COMBINE TO RENDER EVERY PART OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY CAPABLE OF
SUPPORTING A DENSE POPULATION
AS A DWELLING PLACE FOR CIVILIZED MAN IT
IS BY FAR THE FIRST UPON OUR GLOBE
EDITOR'S TABLE HARPER'S MAGAZINE FEBRUARY 1863
CHAPTER 1
THE RIVER AND ITS HISTORY
THE MISSISSIPPI IS WELL WORTH READING ABOUT
IT IS NOT A COMMONPLACE
RIVER BUT ON THE CONTRARY IS IN ALL WAYS REMARKABLE
CONSIDERING THE
MISSOURI ITS MAIN BRANCH IT IS THE LONGEST RIVER IN THE WORLD FOUR
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MILES
IT SEEMS SAFE TO SAY THAT IT IS ALSO THE
CROOKEDEST RIVER IN THE WORLD SINCE IN ONE PART OF ITS JOURNEY IT USES
UP ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MILES TO COVER THE SAME GROUND THAT THE
CROW WOULD FLY OVER IN SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE
IT DISCHARGES THREE
TIMES AS MUCH WATER AS THE ST
LAWRENCE TWENTY FIVE TIMES AS MUCH
AS THE RHINE AND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT TIMES AS MUCH AS THE
THAMES
NO OTHER RIVER HAS SO VAST A DRAINAGE BASIN IT DRAWS ITS WATER
SUPPLY FROM TWENTY EIGHT STATES AND TERRITORIES FROM DELAWARE ON THE
ATLANTIC SEABOARD AND FROM ALL THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THAT AND IDAHO ON
THE PACIFIC SLOPE A SPREAD OF FORTY FIVE DEGREES OF LONGITUDE
THE
MISSISSIPPI RECEIVES AND CARRIES TO THE GULF WATER FROM FIFTY FOUR
SUBORDINATE RIVERS THAT ARE NAVIGABLE BY STEAMBOATS AND FROM SOME
HUNDREDS THAT ARE NAVIGABLE BY FLATS AND KEELS
THE AREA OF ITS
DRAINAGE BASIN IS AS GREAT AS THE COMBINED AREAS OF ENGLAND WALES
SCOTLAND IRELAND FRANCE SPAIN PORTUGAL GERMANY AUSTRIA ITALY
AND TURKEY AND ALMOST ALL THIS WIDE REGION IS FERTILE THE MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY PROPER IS EXCEPTIONALLY SO
IT IS A REMARKABLE RIVER IN THIS THAT INSTEAD OF WIDENING TOWARD ITS
MOUTH IT GROWS NARROWER GROWS NARROWER AND DEEPER
FROM THE JUNCTION
OF THE OHIO TO A POINT HALF WAY DOWN TO THE SEA THE WIDTH AVERAGES A
MILE IN HIGH WATER THENCE TO THE SEA THE WIDTH STEADILY DIMINISHES
UNTIL AT THE 'PASSES ABOVE THE MOUTH IT IS BUT LITTLE OVER HALF
A MILE
AT THE JUNCTION OF THE OHIO THE MISSISSIPPI'S DEPTH IS
EIGHTY SEVEN FEET THE DEPTH INCREASES GRADUALLY REACHING ONE HUNDRED
AND TWENTY NINE JUST ABOVE THE MOUTH
THE DIFFERENCE IN RISE AND FALL IS ALSO REMARKABLE NOT IN THE UPPER
BUT IN THE LOWER RIVER
THE RISE IS TOLERABLY UNIFORM DOWN TO NATCHEZ
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH ABOUT FIFTY FEET
BUT AT BAYOU LA FOURCHE THE RIVER RISES ONLY TWENTY FOUR FEET AT NEW
ORLEANS ONLY FIFTEEN AND JUST ABOVE THE MOUTH ONLY TWO AND ONE HALF
AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW ORLEANS 'TIMES DEMOCRAT BASED UPON REPORTS OF
ABLE ENGINEERS STATES THAT THE RIVER ANNUALLY EMPTIES FOUR HUNDRED AND
SIX MILLION TONS OF MUD INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO WHICH BRINGS TO MIND
CAPTAIN MARRYAT'S RUDE NAME FOR THE MISSISSIPPI 'THE GREAT SEWER THIS
MUD SOLIDIFIED WOULD MAKE A MASS A MILE SQUARE AND TWO HUNDRED AND
FORTY ONE FEET HIGH
THE MUD DEPOSIT GRADUALLY EXTENDS THE LAND BUT ONLY GRADUALLY IT HAS
EXTENDED IT NOT QUITE A THIRD OF A MILE IN THE TWO HUNDRED YEARS WHICH
HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE RIVER TOOK ITS PLACE IN HISTORY
THE BELIEF OF
THE SCIENTIFIC PEOPLE IS THAT THE MOUTH USED TO BE AT BATON ROUGE
WHERE THE HILLS CEASE AND THAT THE TWO HUNDRED MILES OF LAND BETWEEN
THERE AND THE GULF WAS BUILT BY THE RIVER
THIS GIVES US THE AGE OF THAT
PIECE OF COUNTRY WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE AT ALL ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
THOUSAND YEARS
YET IT IS MUCH THE YOUTHFULLEST BATCH OF COUNTRY THAT
LIES AROUND THERE ANYWHERE
THE MISSISSIPPI IS REMARKABLE IN STILL ANOTHER WAY ITS DISPOSITION TO
MAKE PRODIGIOUS JUMPS BY CUTTING THROUGH NARROW NECKS OF LAND AND THUS
STRAIGHTENING AND SHORTENING ITSELF
MORE THAN ONCE IT HAS SHORTENED
ITSELF THIRTY MILES AT A SINGLE JUMP THESE CUT OFFS HAVE HAD CURIOUS
EFFECTS THEY HAVE THROWN SEVERAL RIVER TOWNS OUT INTO THE RURAL
DISTRICTS AND BUILT UP SAND BARS AND FORESTS IN FRONT OF THEM
THE TOWN
OF DELTA USED TO BE THREE MILES BELOW VICKSBURG A RECENT CUTOFF HAS
RADICALLY CHANGED THE POSITION AND DELTA IS NOW TWO MILES ABOVE
VICKSBURG
BOTH OF THESE RIVER TOWNS HAVE BEEN RETIRED TO THE COUNTRY BY THAT
CUT OFF
A CUT OFF PLAYS HAVOC WITH BOUNDARY LINES AND JURISDICTIONS
FOR INSTANCE A MAN IS LIVING IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI TO DAY A
CUT OFF OCCURS TO NIGHT AND TO MORROW THE MAN FINDS HIMSELF AND HIS
LAND OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES AND
SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA SUCH A THING HAPPENING
IN THE UPPER RIVER IN THE OLD TIMES COULD HAVE TRANSFERRED A SLAVE FROM
MISSOURI TO ILLINOIS AND MADE A FREE MAN OF HIM
THE MISSISSIPPI DOES NOT ALTER ITS LOCALITY BY CUT OFFS ALONE IT
IS ALWAYS CHANGING ITS HABITAT BODILY IS ALWAYS MOVING BODILY
SIDEWISE
AT HARD TIMES LA THE RIVER IS TWO MILES WEST OF THE
REGION IT USED TO OCCUPY
AS A RESULT THE ORIGINAL SITE OF THAT
SETTLEMENT IS NOT NOW IN LOUISIANA AT ALL BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE RIVER IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI
NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THAT ONE
THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MILES OF OLD MISSISSIPPI RIVER WHICH LA SALLE
FLOATED DOWN IN HIS CANOES TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO IS GOOD SOLID DRY
GROUND NOW
THE RIVER LIES TO THE RIGHT OF IT IN PLACES AND TO THE
LEFT OF IT IN OTHER PLACES
ALTHOUGH THE MISSISSIPPI'S MUD BUILDS LAND BUT SLOWLY DOWN AT THE
MOUTH WHERE THE GULFS BILLOWS INTERFERE WITH ITS WORK IT BUILDS FAST
ENOUGH IN BETTER PROTECTED REGIONS HIGHER UP FOR INSTANCE PROPHET'S
ISLAND CONTAINED ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ACRES OF LAND THIRTY YEARS
AGO SINCE THEN THE RIVER HAS ADDED SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES TO IT
BUT ENOUGH OF THESE EXAMPLES OF THE MIGHTY STREAM'S ECCENTRICITIES FOR
THE PRESENT I WILL GIVE A FEW MORE OF THEM FURTHER ALONG IN THE BOOK
LET US DROP THE MISSISSIPPI'S PHYSICAL HISTORY AND SAY A WORD ABOUT ITS
HISTORICAL HISTORY SO TO SPEAK
WE CAN GLANCE BRIEFLY AT ITS SLUMBROUS
FIRST EPOCH IN A COUPLE OF SHORT CHAPTERS AT ITS SECOND AND WIDER AWAKE
EPOCH IN A COUPLE MORE AT ITS FLUSHEST AND WIDEST AWAKE EPOCH IN A GOOD
MANY SUCCEEDING CHAPTERS AND THEN TALK ABOUT ITS COMPARATIVELY TRANQUIL
PRESENT EPOCH IN WHAT SHALL BE LEFT OF THE BOOK
THE WORLD AND THE BOOKS ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO USE AND OVER USE THE WORD
'NEW' IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COUNTRY THAT WE EARLY GET AND PERMANENTLY
RETAIN THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS NOTHING OLD ABOUT IT
WE DO OF
COURSE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPARATIVELY OLD DATES IN AMERICAN
HISTORY BUT THE MERE FIGURES CONVEY TO OUR MINDS NO JUST IDEA NO
DISTINCT REALIZATION OF THE STRETCH OF TIME WHICH THEY REPRESENT
TO SAY THAT DE SOTO THE FIRST WHITE MAN WHO EVER SAW THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER SAW IT IN 1542 IS A REMARK WHICH STATES A FACT WITHOUT
INTERPRETING IT IT IS SOMETHING LIKE GIVING THE DIMENSIONS OF A SUNSET
BY ASTRONOMICAL MEASUREMENTS AND CATALOGUING THE COLORS BY THEIR
SCIENTIFIC NAMES AS A RESULT YOU GET THE BALD FACT OF THE SUNSET BUT
YOU DON'T SEE THE SUNSET
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO PAINT A PICTURE
OF IT
THE DATE 1542 STANDING BY ITSELF MEANS LITTLE OR NOTHING TO US BUT
WHEN ONE GROUPS A FEW NEIGHBORING HISTORICAL DATES AND FACTS AROUND IT
HE ADDS PERSPECTIVE AND COLOR AND THEN REALIZES THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE
AMERICAN DATES WHICH IS QUITE RESPECTABLE FOR AGE
FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE MISSISSIPPI WAS FIRST SEEN BY A WHITE MAN LESS
THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY HAD ELAPSED SINCE FRANCIS I 'S DEFEAT AT
PAVIA THE DEATH OF RAPHAEL THE DEATH OF BAYARD SANS PEUR ET SANS
REPROCHE THE DRIVING OUT OF THE KNIGHTS HOSPITALLERS FROM RHODES BY
THE TURKS AND THE PLACARDING OF THE NINETY FIVE PROPOSITIONS THE ACT
WHICH BEGAN THE REFORMATION
WHEN DE SOTO TOOK HIS GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER
IGNATIUS LOYOLA WAS AN OBSCURE NAME THE ORDER OF THE JESUITS WAS NOT
YET A YEAR OLD MICHAEL ANGELO'S PAINT WAS NOT YET DRY ON THE LAST
JUDGMENT IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS WAS NOT YET BORN
BUT WOULD BE BEFORE THE YEAR CLOSED
CATHERINE DE MEDICI WAS A CHILD
ELIZABETH OF ENGLAND WAS NOT YET IN HER TEENS CALVIN BENVENUTO
CELLINI AND THE EMPEROR CHARLES V
WERE AT THE TOP OF THEIR FAME AND
EACH WAS MANUFACTURING HISTORY AFTER HIS OWN PECULIAR FASHION MARGARET
OF NAVARRE WAS WRITING THE 'HEPTAMERON' AND SOME RELIGIOUS BOOKS THE
FIRST SURVIVES THE OTHERS ARE FORGOTTEN WIT AND INDELICACY BEING
SOMETIMES BETTER LITERATURE PRESERVERS THAN HOLINESS LAX COURT MORALS
AND THE ABSURD CHIVALRY BUSINESS WERE IN FULL FEATHER AND THE JOUST AND
THE TOURNAMENT WERE THE FREQUENT PASTIME OF TITLED FINE GENTLEMEN WHO
COULD FIGHT BETTER THAN THEY COULD SPELL WHILE RELIGION WAS THE PASSION
OF THEIR LADIES AND CLASSIFYING THEIR OFFSPRING INTO CHILDREN OF FULL
RANK AND CHILDREN BY BREVET THEIR PASTIME
IN FACT ALL AROUND RELIGION WAS IN A PECULIARLY BLOOMING CONDITION
THE COUNCIL OF TRENT WAS BEING CALLED THE SPANISH INQUISITION WAS
ROASTING AND RACKING AND BURNING WITH A FREE HAND ELSEWHERE ON THE
CONTINENT THE NATIONS WERE BEING PERSUADED TO HOLY LIVING BY THE SWORD
AND FIRE IN ENGLAND HENRY VIII
HAD SUPPRESSED THE MONASTERIES
BURNT FISHER AND ANOTHER BISHOP OR TWO AND WAS GETTING HIS ENGLISH
REFORMATION AND HIS HAREM EFFECTIVELY STARTED
WHEN DE SOTO STOOD ON THE
BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI IT WAS STILL TWO YEARS BEFORE LUTHER'S DEATH
ELEVEN YEARS BEFORE THE BURNING OF SERVETUS THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE ST
BARTHOLOMEW SLAUGHTER RABELAIS WAS NOT YET PUBLISHED 'DON QUIXOTE' WAS
NOT YET WRITTEN SHAKESPEARE WAS NOT YET BORN A HUNDRED LONG YEARS MUST
STILL ELAPSE BEFORE ENGLISHMEN WOULD HEAR THE NAME OF OLIVER CROMWELL
UNQUESTIONABLY THE DISCOVERY OF THE MISSISSIPPI IS A DATABLE FACT WHICH
CONSIDERABLY MELLOWS AND MODIFIES THE SHINY NEWNESS OF OUR COUNTRY AND
GIVES HER A MOST RESPECTABLE OUTSIDE ASPECT OF RUSTINESS AND ANTIQUITY
DE SOTO MERELY GLIMPSED THE RIVER THEN DIED AND WAS BURIED IN IT BY HIS
PRIESTS AND SOLDIERS
ONE WOULD EXPECT THE PRIESTS AND THE SOLDIERS
TO MULTIPLY THE RIVER'S DIMENSIONS BY TEN THE SPANISH CUSTOM OF THE
DAY AND THUS MOVE OTHER ADVENTURERS TO GO AT ONCE AND EXPLORE IT
ON
THE CONTRARY THEIR NARRATIVES WHEN THEY REACHED HOME DID NOT EXCITE
THAT AMOUNT OF CURIOSITY
THE MISSISSIPPI WAS LEFT UNVISITED BY WHITES
DURING A TERM OF YEARS WHICH SEEMS INCREDIBLE IN OUR ENERGETIC DAYS
ONE
MAY 'SENSE' THE INTERVAL TO HIS MIND AFTER A FASHION BY DIVIDING IT
UP IN THIS WAY AFTER DE SOTO GLIMPSED THE RIVER A FRACTION SHORT OF
A QUARTER OF A CENTURY ELAPSED AND THEN SHAKESPEARE WAS BORN LIVED A
TRIFLE MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY THEN DIED AND WHEN HE HAD BEEN IN HIS
GRAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY THE SECOND WHITE MAN SAW
THE MISSISSIPPI
IN OUR DAY WE DON'T ALLOW A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS TO
ELAPSE BETWEEN GLIMPSES OF A MARVEL
IF SOMEBODY SHOULD DISCOVER A CREEK
IN THE COUNTY NEXT TO THE ONE THAT THE NORTH POLE IS IN EUROPE AND
AMERICA WOULD START FIFTEEN COSTLY EXPEDITIONS THITHER ONE TO EXPLORE
THE CREEK AND THE OTHER FOURTEEN TO HUNT FOR EACH OTHER
FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS THERE HAD BEEN WHITE SETTLEMENTS
ON OUR ATLANTIC COASTS
THESE PEOPLE WERE IN INTIMATE COMMUNICATION
WITH THE INDIANS IN THE SOUTH THE SPANIARDS WERE ROBBING SLAUGHTERING
ENSLAVING AND CONVERTING THEM HIGHER UP THE ENGLISH WERE TRADING BEADS
AND BLANKETS TO THEM FOR A CONSIDERATION AND THROWING IN CIVILIZATION
AND WHISKEY 'FOR LAGNIAPPE AND IN CANADA THE FRENCH WERE SCHOOLING
THEM IN A RUDIMENTARY WAY MISSIONARYING AMONG THEM AND DRAWING WHOLE
POPULATIONS OF THEM AT A TIME TO QUEBEC AND LATER TO MONTREAL TO BUY
FURS OF THEM
NECESSARILY THEN THESE VARIOUS CLUSTERS OF WHITES MUST
HAVE HEARD OF THE GREAT RIVER OF THE FAR WEST AND INDEED THEY DID
HEAR OF IT VAGUELY SO VAGUELY AND INDEFINITELY THAT ITS COURSE
PROPORTIONS AND LOCALITY WERE HARDLY EVEN GUESSABLE
THE MERE
MYSTERIOUSNESS OF THE MATTER OUGHT TO HAVE FIRED CURIOSITY AND COMPELLED
EXPLORATION BUT THIS DID NOT OCCUR
APPARENTLY NOBODY HAPPENED TO WANT
SUCH A RIVER NOBODY NEEDED IT NOBODY WAS CURIOUS ABOUT IT SO FOR
A CENTURY AND A HALF THE MISSISSIPPI REMAINED OUT OF THE MARKET AND
UNDISTURBED
WHEN DE SOTO FOUND IT HE WAS NOT HUNTING FOR A RIVER AND
HAD NO PRESENT OCCASION FOR ONE CONSEQUENTLY HE DID NOT VALUE IT OR
EVEN TAKE ANY PARTICULAR NOTICE OF IT
BUT AT LAST LA SALLE THE FRENCHMAN CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF SEEKING OUT
THAT RIVER AND EXPLORING IT
IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THAT WHEN A MAN SEIZES
UPON A NEGLECTED AND IMPORTANT IDEA PEOPLE INFLAMED WITH THE SAME
NOTION CROP UP ALL AROUND
IT HAPPENED SO IN THIS INSTANCE
NATURALLY THE QUESTION SUGGESTS ITSELF WHY DID THESE PEOPLE WANT THE
RIVER NOW WHEN NOBODY HAD WANTED IT IN THE FIVE PRECEDING GENERATIONS
APPARENTLY IT WAS BECAUSE AT THIS LATE DAY THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD
DISCOVERED A WAY TO MAKE IT USEFUL FOR IT HAD COME TO BE BELIEVED
THAT THE MISSISSIPPI EMPTIED INTO THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA AND THEREFORE
AFFORDED A SHORT CUT FROM CANADA TO CHINA
PREVIOUSLY THE SUPPOSITION
HAD BEEN THAT IT EMPTIED INTO THE ATLANTIC OR SEA OF VIRGINIA
CHAPTER 2
THE RIVER AND ITS EXPLORERS
LA SALLE HIMSELF SUED FOR CERTAIN HIGH PRIVILEGES AND THEY WERE
GRACIOUSLY ACCORDED HIM BY LOUIS XIV OF INFLATED MEMORY
CHIEF AMONG
THEM WAS THE PRIVILEGE TO EXPLORE FAR AND WIDE AND BUILD FORTS AND
STAKE OUT CONTINENTS AND HAND THE SAME OVER TO THE KING AND PAY THE
EXPENSES HIMSELF RECEIVING IN RETURN SOME LITTLE ADVANTAGES OF ONE
SORT OR ANOTHER AMONG THEM THE MONOPOLY OF BUFFALO HIDES
HE SPENT
SEVERAL YEARS AND ABOUT ALL OF HIS MONEY IN MAKING PERILOUS AND PAINFUL
TRIPS BETWEEN MONTREAL AND A FORT WHICH HE HAD BUILT ON THE ILLINOIS
BEFORE HE AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN GETTING HIS EXPEDITION IN SUCH A SHAPE
THAT HE COULD STRIKE FOR THE MISSISSIPPI
AND MEANTIME OTHER PARTIES HAD HAD BETTER FORTUNE
IN 1673 JOLIET THE
MERCHANT AND MARQUETTE THE PRIEST CROSSED THE COUNTRY AND REACHED THE
BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI
THEY WENT BY WAY OF THE GREAT LAKES AND FROM
GREEN BAY IN CANOES BY WAY OF FOX RIVER AND THE WISCONSIN
MARQUETTE
HAD SOLEMNLY CONTRACTED ON THE FEAST OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION THAT
IF THE VIRGIN WOULD PERMIT HIM TO DISCOVER THE GREAT RIVER HE WOULD
NAME IT CONCEPTION IN HER HONOR
HE KEPT HIS WORD
IN THAT DAY ALL
EXPLORERS TRAVELED WITH AN OUTFIT OF PRIESTS
DE SOTO HAD TWENTY FOUR
WITH HIM
LA SALLE HAD SEVERAL ALSO
THE EXPEDITIONS WERE OFTEN OUT OF
MEAT AND SCANT OF CLOTHES BUT THEY ALWAYS HAD THE FURNITURE AND OTHER
REQUISITES FOR THE MASS THEY WERE ALWAYS PREPARED AS ONE OF THE QUAINT
CHRONICLERS OF THE TIME PHRASED IT TO 'EXPLAIN HELL TO THE SAVAGES
ON THE 17TH OF JUNE 1673 THE CANOES OF JOLIET AND MARQUETTE AND
THEIR FIVE SUBORDINATES REACHED THE JUNCTION OF THE WISCONSIN WITH THE
MISSISSIPPI
MR
PARKMAN SAYS 'BEFORE THEM A WIDE AND RAPID CURRENT
COURSED ATHWART THEIR WAY BY THE FOOT OF LOFTY HEIGHTS WRAPPED THICK
IN FORESTS HE CONTINUES 'TURNING SOUTHWARD THEY PADDLED DOWN THE
STREAM THROUGH A SOLITUDE UNRELIEVED BY THE FAINTEST TRACE OF MAN
A BIG CAT FISH COLLIDED WITH MARQUETTE'S CANOE AND STARTLED HIM AND
REASONABLY ENOUGH FOR HE HAD BEEN WARNED BY THE INDIANS THAT HE WAS
ON A FOOLHARDY JOURNEY AND EVEN A FATAL ONE FOR THE RIVER CONTAINED
A DEMON 'WHOSE ROAR COULD BE HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE AND WHO WOULD
ENGULF THEM IN THE ABYSS WHERE HE DWELT I HAVE SEEN A MISSISSIPPI
CAT FISH THAT WAS MORE THAN SIX FEET LONG AND WEIGHED TWO HUNDRED AND
FIFTY POUNDS AND IF MARQUETTE'S FISH WAS THE FELLOW TO THAT ONE HE HAD
A FAIR RIGHT TO THINK THE RIVER'S ROARING DEMON WAS COME
'AT LENGTH THE BUFFALO BEGAN TO APPEAR GRAZING IN HERDS ON THE GREAT
PRAIRIES WHICH THEN BORDERED THE RIVER AND MARQUETTE DESCRIBES THE
FIERCE AND STUPID LOOK OF THE OLD BULLS AS THEY STARED AT THE INTRUDERS
THROUGH THE TANGLED MANE WHICH NEARLY BLINDED THEM
THE VOYAGERS MOVED CAUTIOUSLY 'LANDED AT NIGHT AND MADE A FIRE TO COOK
THEIR EVENING MEAL THEN EXTINGUISHED IT EMBARKED AGAIN PADDLED SOME
WAY FARTHER AND ANCHORED IN THE STREAM KEEPING A MAN ON THE WATCH TILL
MORNING
THEY DID THIS DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AND AT THE END OF TWO
WEEKS THEY HAD NOT SEEN A HUMAN BEING
THE RIVER WAS AN AWFUL SOLITUDE
THEN
AND IT IS NOW OVER MOST OF ITS STRETCH
BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE FORTNIGHT THEY ONE DAY CAME UPON THE FOOTPRINTS
OF MEN IN THE MUD OF THE WESTERN BANK A ROBINSON CRUSOE EXPERIENCE
WHICH CARRIES AN ELECTRIC SHIVER WITH IT YET WHEN ONE STUMBLES ON IT IN
PRINT
THEY HAD BEEN WARNED THAT THE RIVER INDIANS WERE AS FEROCIOUS AND
PITILESS AS THE RIVER DEMON AND DESTROYED ALL COMERS WITHOUT WAITING
FOR PROVOCATION BUT NO MATTER JOLIET AND MARQUETTE STRUCK INTO THE
COUNTRY TO HUNT UP THE PROPRIETORS OF THE TRACKS
THEY FOUND THEM BY
AND BY AND WERE HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WELL TREATED IF TO BE RECEIVED
BY AN INDIAN CHIEF WHO HAS TAKEN OFF HIS LAST RAG IN ORDER TO APPEAR
AT HIS LEVEL BEST IS TO BE RECEIVED HOSPITABLY AND IF TO BE TREATED
ABUNDANTLY TO FISH PORRIDGE AND OTHER GAME INCLUDING DOG AND HAVE
THESE THINGS FORKED INTO ONE'S MOUTH BY THE UNGLOVED FINGERS OF INDIANS
IS TO BE WELL TREATED
IN THE MORNING THE CHIEF AND SIX HUNDRED OF HIS
TRIBESMEN ESCORTED THE FRENCHMEN TO THE RIVER AND BADE THEM A FRIENDLY
FAREWELL
ON THE ROCKS ABOVE THE PRESENT CITY OF ALTON THEY FOUND SOME RUDE AND
FANTASTIC INDIAN PAINTINGS WHICH THEY DESCRIBE
A SHORT DISTANCE BELOW
'A TORRENT OF YELLOW MUD RUSHED FURIOUSLY ATHWART THE CALM BLUE CURRENT
OF THE MISSISSIPPI BOILING AND SURGING AND SWEEPING IN ITS COURSE LOGS
BRANCHES AND UPROOTED TREES THIS WAS THE MOUTH OF THE MISSOURI 'THAT
SAVAGE RIVER WHICH 'DESCENDING FROM ITS MAD CAREER THROUGH A VAST
UNKNOWN OF BARBARISM POURED ITS TURBID FLOODS INTO THE BOSOM OF ITS
GENTLE SISTER
BY AND BY THEY PASSED THE MOUTH OF THE OHIO THEY PASSED CANE BRAKES
THEY FOUGHT MOSQUITOES THEY FLOATED ALONG DAY AFTER DAY THROUGH THE
DEEP SILENCE AND LONELINESS OF THE RIVER DROWSING IN THE SCANT SHADE
OF MAKESHIFT AWNINGS AND BROILING WITH THE HEAT THEY ENCOUNTERED AND
EXCHANGED CIVILITIES WITH ANOTHER PARTY OF INDIANS AND AT LAST
THEY REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE ARKANSAS ABOUT A MONTH OUT FROM THEIR
STARTING POINT WHERE A TRIBE OF WAR WHOOPING SAVAGES SWARMED OUT TO
MEET AND MURDER THEM BUT THEY APPEALED TO THE VIRGIN FOR HELP SO IN
PLACE OF A FIGHT THERE WAS A FEAST AND PLENTY OF PLEASANT PALAVER AND
FOL DE ROL
THEY HAD PROVED TO THEIR SATISFACTION THAT THE MISSISSIPPI DID NOT
EMPTY INTO THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA OR INTO THE ATLANTIC
THEY BELIEVED
IT EMPTIED INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO
THEY TURNED BACK NOW AND CARRIED
THEIR GREAT NEWS TO CANADA
BUT BELIEF IS NOT PROOF
IT WAS RESERVED FOR LA SALLE TO FURNISH THE
PROOF
HE WAS PROVOKINGLY DELAYED BY ONE MISFORTUNE AFTER ANOTHER BUT
AT LAST GOT HIS EXPEDITION UNDER WAY AT THE END OF THE YEAR 1681
IN THE
DEAD OF WINTER HE AND HENRI DE TONTY SON OF LORENZO TONTY WHO INVENTED
THE TONTINE HIS LIEUTENANT STARTED DOWN THE ILLINOIS WITH A
FOLLOWING OF EIGHTEEN INDIANS BROUGHT FROM NEW ENGLAND AND TWENTY THREE
FRENCHMEN
THEY MOVED IN PROCESSION DOWN THE SURFACE OF THE FROZEN
RIVER ON FOOT AND DRAGGING THEIR CANOES AFTER THEM ON SLEDGES
AT PEORIA LAKE THEY STRUCK OPEN WATER AND PADDLED THENCE TO THE
MISSISSIPPI AND TURNED THEIR PROWS SOUTHWARD
THEY PLOWED THROUGH THE
FIELDS OF FLOATING ICE PAST THE MOUTH OF THE MISSOURI PAST THE MOUTH
OF THE OHIO BY AND BY 'AND GLIDING BY THE WASTES OF BORDERING SWAMP
LANDED ON THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY NEAR THE THIRD CHICKASAW BLUFFS WHERE
THEY HALTED AND BUILT FORT PRUDHOMME
'AGAIN SAYS MR
PARKMAN 'THEY EMBARKED AND WITH EVERY STAGE OF THEIR
ADVENTUROUS PROGRESS THE MYSTERY OF THIS VAST NEW WORLD WAS MORE AND
MORE UNVEILED
MORE AND MORE THEY ENTERED THE REALMS OF SPRING
THE
HAZY SUNLIGHT THE WARM AND DROWSY AIR THE TENDER FOLIAGE THE OPENING
FLOWERS BETOKENED THE REVIVING LIFE OF NATURE
DAY BY DAY THEY FLOATED DOWN THE GREAT BENDS IN THE SHADOW OF THE DENSE
FORESTS AND IN TIME ARRIVED AT THE MOUTH OF THE ARKANSAS
FIRST THEY
WERE GREETED BY THE NATIVES OF THIS LOCALITY AS MARQUETTE HAD BEFORE
BEEN GREETED BY THEM WITH THE BOOMING OF THE WAR DRUM AND THE FLOURISH
OF ARMS
THE VIRGIN COMPOSED THE DIFFICULTY IN MARQUETTE'S CASE THE
PIPE OF PEACE DID THE SAME OFFICE FOR LA SALLE
THE WHITE MAN AND THE
RED MAN STRUCK HANDS AND ENTERTAINED EACH OTHER DURING THREE DAYS
THEN
TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE SAVAGES LA SALLE SET UP A CROSS WITH THE
ARMS OF FRANCE ON IT AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY FOR THE
KING THE COOL FASHION OF THE TIME WHILE THE PRIEST PIOUSLY CONSECRATED
THE ROBBERY WITH A HYMN
THE PRIEST EXPLAINED THE MYSTERIES OF THE FAITH
'BY SIGNS FOR THE SAVING OF THE SAVAGES THUS COMPENSATING THEM WITH
POSSIBLE POSSESSIONS IN HEAVEN FOR THE CERTAIN ONES ON EARTH WHICH THEY
HAD JUST BEEN ROBBED OF
AND ALSO BY SIGNS LA SALLE DREW FROM THESE
SIMPLE CHILDREN OF THE FOREST ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF FEALTY TO LOUIS THE
PUTRID OVER THE WATER
NOBODY SMILED AT THESE COLOSSAL IRONIES
THESE PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE SITE OF THE FUTURE TOWN OF
NAPOLEON ARKANSAS AND THERE THE FIRST CONFISCATION CROSS WAS RAISED
ON THE BANKS OF THE GREAT RIVER
MARQUETTE'S AND JOLIET'S VOYAGE
OF DISCOVERY ENDED AT THE SAME SPOT THE SITE OF THE FUTURE TOWN OF
NAPOLEON
WHEN DE SOTO TOOK HIS FLEETING GLIMPSE OF THE RIVER AWAY BACK
IN THE DIM EARLY DAYS HE TOOK IT FROM THAT SAME SPOT THE SITE OF THE
FUTURE TOWN OF NAPOLEON ARKANSAS
THEREFORE THREE OUT OF THE FOUR
MEMORABLE EVENTS CONNECTED WITH THE DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION OF THE
MIGHTY RIVER OCCURRED BY ACCIDENT IN ONE AND THE SAME PLACE
IT IS A
MOST CURIOUS DISTINCTION WHEN ONE COMES TO LOOK AT IT AND THINK ABOUT
IT
FRANCE STOLE THAT VAST COUNTRY ON THAT SPOT THE FUTURE NAPOLEON
AND BY AND BY NAPOLEON HIMSELF WAS TO GIVE THE COUNTRY BACK AGAIN MAKE
RESTITUTION NOT TO THE OWNERS BUT TO THEIR WHITE AMERICAN HEIRS
THE VOYAGERS JOURNEYED ON TOUCHING HERE AND THERE 'PASSED THE SITES
SINCE BECOME HISTORIC OF VICKSBURG AND GRAND GULF AND VISITED AN
IMPOSING INDIAN MONARCH IN THE TECHE COUNTRY WHOSE CAPITAL CITY WAS A
SUBSTANTIAL ONE OF SUN BAKED BRICKS MIXED WITH STRAW BETTER HOUSES THAN
MANY THAT EXIST THERE NOW
THE CHIEFS HOUSE CONTAINED AN AUDIENCE ROOM
FORTY FEET SQUARE AND THERE HE RECEIVED TONTY IN STATE SURROUNDED BY
SIXTY OLD MEN CLOTHED IN WHITE CLOAKS
THERE WAS A TEMPLE IN THE TOWN
WITH A MUD WALL ABOUT IT ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS OF ENEMIES SACRIFICED TO
THE SUN
THE VOYAGERS VISITED THE NATCHEZ INDIANS NEAR THE SITE OF THE
PRESENT CITY OF THAT NAME WHERE THEY FOUND A 'RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL
DESPOTISM A PRIVILEGED CLASS DESCENDED FROM THE SUN A TEMPLE AND A
SACRED FIRE IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE GETTING HOME AGAIN IT WAS HOME
WITH AN ADVANTAGE IN FACT FOR IT LACKED LOUIS XIV
A FEW MORE DAYS SWEPT SWIFTLY BY AND LA SALLE STOOD IN THE SHADOW OF
HIS CONFISCATING CROSS AT THE MEETING OF THE WATERS FROM DELAWARE AND
FROM ITASKA AND FROM THE MOUNTAIN RANGES CLOSE UPON THE PACIFIC
WITH THE WATERS OF THE GULF OF MEXICO HIS TASK FINISHED HIS PRODIGY
ACHIEVED
MR
PARKMAN IN CLOSING HIS FASCINATING NARRATIVE THUS SUMS
UP
'ON THAT DAY THE REALM OF FRANCE RECEIVED ON PARCHMENT A STUPENDOUS
ACCESSION
THE FERTILE PLAINS OF TEXAS THE VAST BASIN OF THE
MISSISSIPPI FROM ITS FROZEN NORTHERN SPRINGS TO THE SULTRY BORDERS OF
THE GULF FROM THE WOODY RIDGES OF THE ALLEGHANIES TO THE BARE PEAKS
OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS A REGION OF SAVANNAS AND FORESTS SUN CRACKED
DESERTS AND GRASSY PRAIRIES WATERED BY A THOUSAND RIVERS RANGED BY
A THOUSAND WARLIKE TRIBES PASSED BENEATH THE SCEPTER OF THE SULTAN OF
VERSAILLES AND ALL BY VIRTUE OF A FEEBLE HUMAN VOICE INAUDIBLE AT HALF
A MILE
CHAPTER 3
FRESCOES FROM THE PAST
APPARENTLY THE RIVER WAS READY FOR BUSINESS NOW
BUT NO THE
DISTRIBUTION OF A POPULATION ALONG ITS BANKS WAS AS CALM AND DELIBERATE
AND TIME DEVOURING A PROCESS AS THE DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION HAD BEEN
SEVENTY YEARS ELAPSED AFTER THE EXPLORATION BEFORE THE RIVER'S BORDERS
HAD A WHITE POPULATION WORTH CONSIDERING AND NEARLY FIFTY MORE BEFORE
THE RIVER HAD A COMMERCE
BETWEEN LA SALLE'S OPENING OF THE RIVER AND
THE TIME WHEN IT MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BECOME THE VEHICLE OF ANYTHING LIKE
A REGULAR AND ACTIVE COMMERCE SEVEN SOVEREIGNS HAD OCCUPIED THE THRONE
OF ENGLAND AMERICA HAD BECOME AN INDEPENDENT NATION LOUIS XIV
AND
LOUIS XV
HAD ROTTED AND DIED THE FRENCH MONARCHY HAD GONE DOWN IN
THE RED TEMPEST OF THE REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON WAS A NAME THAT WAS
BEGINNING TO BE TALKED ABOUT
TRULY THERE WERE SNAILS IN THOSE DAYS
THE RIVER'S EARLIEST COMMERCE WAS IN GREAT BARGES KEELBOATS
BROADHORNS
THEY FLOATED AND SAILED FROM THE UPPER RIVERS TO NEW
ORLEANS CHANGED CARGOES THERE AND WERE TEDIOUSLY WARPED AND POLED BACK
BY HAND
A VOYAGE DOWN AND BACK SOMETIMES OCCUPIED NINE MONTHS
IN TIME
THIS COMMERCE INCREASED UNTIL IT GAVE EMPLOYMENT TO HORDES OF ROUGH AND
HARDY MEN RUDE UNEDUCATED BRAVE SUFFERING TERRIFIC HARDSHIPS WITH
SAILOR LIKE STOICISM HEAVY DRINKERS COARSE FROLICKERS IN MORAL STIES
LIKE THE NATCHEZ UNDER THE HILL OF THAT DAY HEAVY FIGHTERS RECKLESS
FELLOWS EVERY ONE ELEPHANTINELY JOLLY FOUL WITTED PROFANE PRODIGAL
OF THEIR MONEY BANKRUPT AT THE END OF THE TRIP FOND OF BARBARIC
FINERY PRODIGIOUS BRAGGARTS YET IN THE MAIN HONEST TRUSTWORTHY
FAITHFUL TO PROMISES AND DUTY AND OFTEN PICTURESQUELY MAGNANIMOUS
BY AND BY THE STEAMBOAT INTRUDED
THEN FOR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS
THESE MEN CONTINUED TO RUN THEIR KEELBOATS DOWN STREAM AND THE STEAMERS
DID ALL OF THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS THE KEELBOATMEN SELLING THEIR BOATS IN
NEW ORLEANS AND RETURNING HOME AS DECK PASSENGERS IN THE STEAMERS
BUT AFTER A WHILE THE STEAMBOATS SO INCREASED IN NUMBER AND IN SPEED
THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO ABSORB THE ENTIRE COMMERCE AND THEN KEELBOATING
DIED A PERMANENT DEATH
THE KEELBOATMAN BECAME A DECK HAND OR A MATE
OR A PILOT ON THE STEAMER AND WHEN STEAMER BERTHS WERE NOT OPEN TO HIM
HE TOOK A BERTH ON A PITTSBURGH COAL FLAT OR ON A PINE RAFT CONSTRUCTED
IN THE FORESTS UP TOWARD THE SOURCES OF THE MISSISSIPPI
IN THE HEYDAY OF THE STEAMBOATING PROSPERITY THE RIVER FROM END TO END
WAS FLAKED WITH COAL FLEETS AND TIMBER RAFTS ALL MANAGED BY HAND
AND EMPLOYING HOSTS OF THE ROUGH CHARACTERS WHOM I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
DESCRIBE
I REMEMBER THE ANNUAL PROCESSIONS OF MIGHTY RAFTS THAT USED
TO GLIDE BY HANNIBAL WHEN I WAS A BOY AN ACRE OR SO OF WHITE
SWEET SMELLING BOARDS IN EACH RAFT A CREW OF TWO DOZEN MEN OR MORE
THREE OR FOUR WIGWAMS SCATTERED ABOUT THE RAFT'S VAST LEVEL SPACE FOR
STORM QUARTERS AND I REMEMBER THE RUDE WAYS AND THE TREMENDOUS TALK
OF THEIR BIG CREWS THE EX KEELBOATMEN AND THEIR ADMIRINGLY PATTERNING
SUCCESSORS FOR WE USED TO SWIM OUT A QUARTER OR THIRD OF A MILE AND GET
ON THESE RAFTS AND HAVE A RIDE
BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATING KEELBOAT TALK AND MANNERS AND THAT NOW DEPARTED
AND HARDLY REMEMBERED RAFT LIFE I WILL THROW IN IN THIS PLACE A
CHAPTER FROM A BOOK WHICH I HAVE BEEN WORKING AT BY FITS AND STARTS
DURING THE PAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS AND MAY POSSIBLY FINISH IN THE COURSE
OF FIVE OR SIX MORE
THE BOOK IS A STORY WHICH DETAILS SOME PASSAGES IN
THE LIFE OF AN IGNORANT VILLAGE BOY HUCK FINN SON OF THE TOWN DRUNKARD
OF MY TIME OUT WEST THERE
HE HAS RUN AWAY FROM HIS PERSECUTING
FATHER AND FROM A PERSECUTING GOOD WIDOW WHO WISHES TO MAKE A NICE
TRUTH TELLING RESPECTABLE BOY OF HIM AND WITH HIM A SLAVE OF THE
WIDOW'S HAS ALSO ESCAPED
THEY HAVE FOUND A FRAGMENT OF A LUMBER RAFT
IT IS HIGH WATER AND DEAD SUMMER TIME AND ARE FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER
BY NIGHT AND HIDING IN THE WILLOWS BY DAY BOUND FOR CAIRO WHENCE
THE NEGRO WILL SEEK FREEDOM IN THE HEART OF THE FREE STATES
BUT IN A
FOG THEY PASS CAIRO WITHOUT KNOWING IT
BY AND BY THEY BEGIN TO SUSPECT
THE TRUTH AND HUCK FINN IS PERSUADED TO END THE DISMAL SUSPENSE BY
SWIMMING DOWN TO A HUGE RAFT WHICH THEY HAVE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AHEAD
OF THEM CREEPING ABOARD UNDER COVER OF THE DARKNESS AND GATHERING THE
NEEDED INFORMATION BY EAVESDROPPING
BUT YOU KNOW A YOUNG PERSON CAN'T WAIT VERY WELL WHEN HE IS IMPATIENT TO
FIND A THING OUT
WE TALKED IT OVER AND BY AND BY JIM SAID IT WAS SUCH
A BLACK NIGHT NOW THAT IT WOULDN'T BE NO RISK TO SWIM DOWN TO THE BIG
RAFT AND CRAWL ABOARD AND LISTEN THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT CAIRO BECAUSE
THEY WOULD BE CALCULATING TO GO ASHORE THERE FOR A SPREE MAYBE OR
ANYWAY THEY WOULD SEND BOATS ASHORE TO BUY WHISKEY OR FRESH MEAT OR
SOMETHING
JIM HAD A WONDERFUL LEVEL HEAD FOR A NIGGER HE COULD MOST
ALWAYS START A GOOD PLAN WHEN YOU WANTED ONE
I STOOD UP AND SHOOK MY RAGS OFF AND JUMPED INTO THE RIVER AND STRUCK
OUT FOR THE RAFT'S LIGHT
BY AND BY WHEN I GOT DOWN NEARLY TO HER
I EASED UP AND WENT SLOW AND CAUTIOUS
BUT EVERYTHING WAS ALL
RIGHT NOBODY AT THE SWEEPS
SO I SWUM DOWN ALONG THE RAFT TILL I WAS
MOST ABREAST THE CAMP FIRE IN THE MIDDLE THEN I CRAWLED ABOARD AND
INCHED ALONG AND GOT IN AMONGST SOME BUNDLES OF SHINGLES ON THE WEATHER
SIDE OF THE FIRE
THERE WAS THIRTEEN MEN THERE THEY WAS THE WATCH ON
DECK OF COURSE
AND A MIGHTY ROUGH LOOKING LOT TOO
THEY HAD A JUG AND
TIN CUPS AND THEY KEPT THE JUG MOVING
ONE MAN WAS SINGING ROARING
YOU MAY SAY AND IT WASN'T A NICE SONG FOR A PARLOR ANYWAY
HE ROARED
THROUGH HIS NOSE AND STRUNG OUT THE LAST WORD OF EVERY LINE VERY LONG
WHEN HE WAS DONE THEY ALL FETCHED A KIND OF INJUN WAR WHOOP AND THEN
ANOTHER WAS SUNG
IT BEGUN
'THERE WAS A WOMAN IN OUR TOWDN IN OUR TOWDN DID DWED'L DWELL SHE
LOVED HER HUSBAND DEAR I LEE BUT ANOTHER MAN TWYSTEAS WED'L
SINGING TOO RILOO RILOO RILOO RI TOO RILOO RILAY SHE LOVED HER
HUSBAND DEAR I LEE BUT ANOTHER MAN TWYSTE AS WED'L
AND SO ON FOURTEEN VERSES
IT WAS KIND OF POOR AND WHEN HE WAS GOING
TO START ON THE NEXT VERSE ONE OF THEM SAID IT WAS THE TUNE THE OLD COW
DIED ON AND ANOTHER ONE SAID 'OH GIVE US A REST AND ANOTHER ONE
TOLD HIM TO TAKE A WALK
THEY MADE FUN OF HIM TILL HE GOT MAD AND JUMPED
UP AND BEGUN TO CUSS THE CROWD AND SAID HE COULD LAME ANY THIEF IN THE
LOT
THEY WAS ALL ABOUT TO MAKE A BREAK FOR HIM BUT THE BIGGEST MAN THERE
JUMPED UP AND SAYS
'SET WHAR YOU ARE GENTLEMEN
LEAVE HIM TO ME HE'S MY MEAT
THEN HE JUMPED UP IN THE AIR THREE TIMES AND CRACKED HIS HEELS TOGETHER
EVERY TIME
HE FLUNG OFF A BUCKSKIN COAT THAT WAS ALL HUNG WITH FRINGES
AND SAYS 'YOU LAY THAR TELL THE CHAWIN UP'S DONE AND FLUNG HIS HAT
DOWN WHICH WAS ALL OVER RIBBONS AND SAYS 'YOU LAY THAR TELL HIS

BREAST WITH HIS FIST SAYING 'LOOK AT ME GENTLEMEN WHEN HE GOT
THROUGH HE JUMPED UP AND CRACKED HIS HEELS TOGETHER THREE TIMES AND
LET OFF A ROARING 'WHOO OOP I'M THE BLOODIEST SON OF A WILDCAT THAT

THEN THE MAN THAT HAD STARTED THE ROW TILTED HIS OLD SLOUCH HAT DOWN
OVER HIS RIGHT EYE THEN HE BENT STOOPING FORWARD WITH HIS BACK SAGGED
AND HIS SOUTH END STICKING OUT FAR AND HIS FISTS A SHOVING OUT AND
DRAWING IN IN FRONT OF HIM AND SO WENT AROUND IN A LITTLE CIRCLE
ABOUT THREE TIMES SWELLING HIMSELF UP AND BREATHING HARD
THEN HE

HEELS TOGETHER THREE TIMES BEFORE HE LIT THEY CHEERED HIM AGAIN AND
AS HE COME DOWN HE SHOUTED OUT 'WHOO OOP BOW YOUR NECK AND SPREAD FOR
THE PET CHILD OF CALAMITY'S A COMING
THEN THE OTHER ONE WENT TO SWELLING AROUND AND BLOWING AGAIN THE FIRST
ONE THE ONE THEY CALLED BOB NEXT THE CHILD OF CALAMITY CHIPPED IN

VERY WORST KIND OF LANGUAGE NEXT BOB KNOCKED THE CHILD'S HAT OFF AND
THE CHILD PICKED IT UP AND KICKED BOB'S RIBBONY HAT ABOUT SIX FOOT BOB
WENT AND GOT IT AND SAID NEVER MIND THIS WARN'T GOING TO BE THE LAST
OF THIS THING BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN THAT NEVER FORGOT AND NEVER FORGIVE
AND SO THE CHILD BETTER LOOK OUT FOR THERE WAS A TIME A COMING JUST
AS SURE AS HE WAS A LIVING MAN THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER TO HIM WITH
THE BEST BLOOD IN HIS BODY
THE CHILD SAID NO MAN WAS WILLINGER THAN
HE WAS FOR THAT TIME TO COME AND HE WOULD GIVE BOB FAIR WARNING NOW
NEVER TO CROSS HIS PATH AGAIN FOR HE COULD NEVER REST TILL HE HAD WADED
IN HIS BLOOD FOR SUCH WAS HIS NATURE THOUGH HE WAS SPARING HIM NOW ON
ACCOUNT OF HIS FAMILY IF HE HAD ONE
BOTH OF THEM WAS EDGING AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS GROWLING AND
SHAKING THEIR HEADS AND GOING ON ABOUT WHAT THEY WAS GOING TO DO BUT A
LITTLE BLACK WHISKERED CHAP SKIPPED UP AND SAYS
'COME BACK HERE YOU COUPLE OF CHICKEN LIVERED COWARDS AND I'LL THRASH
THE TWO OF YE
AND HE DONE IT TOO
HE SNATCHED THEM HE JERKED THEM THIS WAY AND THAT
HE BOOTED THEM AROUND HE KNOCKED THEM SPRAWLING FASTER THAN THEY COULD
GET UP

THROUGH AND SHOUT 'SAIL IN CORPSE MAKER 'HI AT HIM AGAIN CHILD OF
CALAMITY 'BULLY FOR YOU LITTLE DAVY WELL IT WAS A PERFECT POW WOW
FOR A WHILE
BOB AND THE CHILD HAD RED NOSES AND BLACK EYES WHEN THEY
GOT THROUGH
LITTLE DAVY MADE THEM OWN UP THAT THEY WERE SNEAKS AND
COWARDS AND NOT FIT TO EAT WITH A DOG OR DRINK WITH A NIGGER THEN BOB
AND THE CHILD SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH OTHER VERY SOLEMN AND SAID THEY
HAD ALWAYS RESPECTED EACH OTHER AND WAS WILLING TO LET BYGONES BE
BYGONES
SO THEN THEY WASHED THEIR FACES IN THE RIVER AND JUST THEN
THERE WAS A LOUD ORDER TO STAND BY FOR A CROSSING AND SOME OF THEM WENT
FORWARD TO MAN THE SWEEPS THERE AND THE REST WENT AFT TO HANDLE THE
AFTER SWEEPS
I LAID STILL AND WAITED FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND HAD A SMOKE OUT OF A
PIPE THAT ONE OF THEM LEFT IN REACH THEN THE CROSSING WAS FINISHED AND
THEY STUMPED BACK AND HAD A DRINK AROUND AND WENT TO TALKING AND SINGING
AGAIN
NEXT THEY GOT OUT AN OLD FIDDLE AND ONE PLAYED AND ANOTHER
PATTED JUBA AND THE REST TURNED THEMSELVES LOOSE ON A REGULAR
OLD FASHIONED KEEL BOAT BREAK DOWN
THEY COULDN'T KEEP THAT UP VERY LONG
WITHOUT GETTING WINDED SO BY AND BY THEY SETTLED AROUND THE JUG AGAIN

CHORUS AND THEN THEY GOT TO TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENCES BETWIXT HOGS AND
THEIR DIFFERENT KIND OF HABITS AND NEXT ABOUT WOMEN AND THEIR DIFFERENT
WAYS AND NEXT ABOUT THE BEST WAYS TO PUT OUT HOUSES THAT WAS AFIRE AND
NEXT ABOUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH THE INJUNS AND NEXT ABOUT WHAT
A KING HAD TO DO AND HOW MUCH HE GOT AND NEXT ABOUT HOW TO MAKE CATS
FIGHT AND NEXT ABOUT WHAT TO DO WHEN A MAN HAS FITS AND NEXT ABOUT
DIFFERENCES BETWIXT CLEAR WATER RIVERS AND MUDDY WATER ONES
THE MAN

THAN THE CLEAR WATER OF THE OHIO HE SAID IF YOU LET A PINT OF THIS
YALLER MISSISSIPPI WATER SETTLE YOU WOULD HAVE ABOUT A HALF TO
THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH OF MUD IN THE BOTTOM ACCORDING TO THE STAGE
OF THE RIVER AND THEN IT WARN'T NO BETTER THAN OHIO WATER WHAT YOU
WANTED TO DO WAS TO KEEP IT STIRRED UP AND WHEN THE RIVER WAS LOW KEEP
MUD ON HAND TO PUT IN AND THICKEN THE WATER UP THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE
THE CHILD OF CALAMITY SAID THAT WAS SO HE SAID THERE WAS NUTRITIOUSNESS
IN THE MUD AND A MAN THAT DRUNK MISSISSIPPI WATER COULD GROW CORN IN
HIS STOMACH IF HE WANTED TO
HE SAYS
'YOU LOOK AT THE GRAVEYARDS THAT TELLS THE TALE
TREES WON'T GROW WORTH
CHUCKS IN A CINCINNATI GRAVEYARD BUT IN A SENT LOUIS GRAVEYARD THEY
GROW UPWARDS OF EIGHT HUNDRED FOOT HIGH
IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THE
WATER THE PEOPLE DRUNK BEFORE THEY LAID UP
A CINCINNATI CORPSE DON'T
RICHEN A SOIL ANY
AND THEY TALKED ABOUT HOW OHIO WATER DIDN'T LIKE TO MIX WITH MISSISSIPPI
WATER
ED SAID IF YOU TAKE THE MISSISSIPPI ON A RISE WHEN THE OHIO IS

OF STEAMBOATING WHICH SEEMS TO ME TO WARRANT FULL EXAMINATION THE
MARVELOUS SCIENCE OF PILOTING AS DISPLAYED THERE
I BELIEVE THERE HAS
BEEN NOTHING LIKE IT ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD
CHAPTER 4
THE BOYS' AMBITION
WHEN I WAS A BOY THERE WAS BUT ONE PERMANENT AMBITION AMONG MY COMRADES
IN OUR VILLAGE FOOTNOTE 1
HANNIBAL MISSOURI ON THE WEST BANK OF
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
THAT WAS TO BE A STEAMBOATMAN
WE HAD TRANSIENT
AMBITIONS OF OTHER SORTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY TRANSIENT
WHEN A CIRCUS
CAME AND WENT IT LEFT US ALL BURNING TO BECOME CLOWNS THE FIRST NEGRO
MINSTREL SHOW THAT CAME TO OUR SECTION LEFT US ALL SUFFERING TO TRY THAT
KIND OF LIFE NOW AND THEN WE HAD A HOPE THAT IF WE LIVED AND WERE GOOD
GOD WOULD PERMIT US TO BE PIRATES
THESE AMBITIONS FADED OUT EACH IN
ITS TURN BUT THE AMBITION TO BE A STEAMBOATMAN ALWAYS REMAINED
ONCE A DAY A CHEAP GAUDY PACKET ARRIVED UPWARD FROM ST
LOUIS AND
ANOTHER DOWNWARD FROM KEOKUK
BEFORE THESE EVENTS THE DAY WAS GLORIOUS
WITH EXPECTANCY AFTER THEM THE DAY WAS A DEAD AND EMPTY THING
NOT
ONLY THE BOYS BUT THE WHOLE VILLAGE FELT THIS
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS I
CAN PICTURE THAT OLD TIME TO MYSELF NOW JUST AS IT WAS THEN THE WHITE
TOWN DROWSING IN THE SUNSHINE OF A SUMMER'S MORNING THE STREETS EMPTY
OR PRETTY NEARLY SO ONE OR TWO CLERKS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE WATER
STREET STORES WITH THEIR SPLINT BOTTOMED CHAIRS TILTED BACK AGAINST
THE WALL CHINS ON BREASTS HATS SLOUCHED OVER THEIR FACES ASLEEP WITH
SHINGLE SHAVINGS ENOUGH AROUND TO SHOW WHAT BROKE THEM DOWN A SOW AND
A LITTER OF PIGS LOAFING ALONG THE SIDEWALK DOING A GOOD BUSINESS IN
WATERMELON RINDS AND SEEDS TWO OR THREE LONELY LITTLE FREIGHT PILES
SCATTERED ABOUT THE 'LEVEE A PILE OF 'SKIDS' ON THE SLOPE OF THE
STONE PAVED WHARF AND THE FRAGRANT TOWN DRUNKARD ASLEEP IN THE SHADOW
OF THEM TWO OR THREE WOOD FLATS AT THE HEAD OF THE WHARF BUT NOBODY TO
LISTEN TO THE PEACEFUL LAPPING OF THE WAVELETS AGAINST THEM THE GREAT
MISSISSIPPI THE MAJESTIC THE MAGNIFICENT MISSISSIPPI ROLLING ITS
MILE WIDE TIDE ALONG SHINING IN THE SUN THE DENSE FOREST AWAY ON THE
OTHER SIDE THE 'POINT' ABOVE THE TOWN AND THE 'POINT' BELOW BOUNDING
THE RIVER GLIMPSE AND TURNING IT INTO A SORT OF SEA AND WITHAL A VERY
STILL AND BRILLIANT AND LONELY ONE
PRESENTLY A FILM OF DARK SMOKE
APPEARS ABOVE ONE OF THOSE REMOTE 'POINTS INSTANTLY A NEGRO DRAYMAN
FAMOUS FOR HIS QUICK EYE AND PRODIGIOUS VOICE LIFTS UP THE CRY
'S T E A M BOAT A COMIN' AND THE SCENE CHANGES THE TOWN DRUNKARD
STIRS THE CLERKS WAKE UP A FURIOUS CLATTER OF DRAYS FOLLOWS EVERY
HOUSE AND STORE POURS OUT A HUMAN CONTRIBUTION AND ALL IN A TWINKLING
THE DEAD TOWN IS ALIVE AND MOVING
DRAYS CARTS MEN BOYS ALL GO HURRYING FROM MANY QUARTERS TO A COMMON
CENTER THE WHARF
ASSEMBLED THERE THE PEOPLE FASTEN THEIR EYES UPON
THE COMING BOAT AS UPON A WONDER THEY ARE SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME
AND
THE BOAT IS RATHER A HANDSOME SIGHT TOO
SHE IS LONG AND SHARP AND
TRIM AND PRETTY SHE HAS TWO TALL FANCY TOPPED CHIMNEYS WITH A GILDED
DEVICE OF SOME KIND SWUNG BETWEEN THEM A FANCIFUL PILOT HOUSE A GLASS
AND 'GINGERBREAD' PERCHED ON TOP OF THE 'TEXAS' DECK BEHIND THEM THE
PADDLE BOXES ARE GORGEOUS WITH A PICTURE OR WITH GILDED RAYS ABOVE THE
BOAT'S NAME THE BOILER DECK THE HURRICANE DECK AND THE TEXAS DECK
ARE FENCED AND ORNAMENTED WITH CLEAN WHITE RAILINGS THERE IS A FLAG
GALLANTLY FLYING FROM THE JACK STAFF THE FURNACE DOORS ARE OPEN AND THE
FIRES GLARING BRAVELY THE UPPER DECKS ARE BLACK WITH PASSENGERS THE
CAPTAIN STANDS BY THE BIG BELL CALM IMPOSING THE ENVY OF ALL GREAT
VOLUMES OF THE BLACKEST SMOKE ARE ROLLING AND TUMBLING OUT OF THE
CHIMNEYS A HUSBANDED GRANDEUR CREATED WITH A BIT OF PITCH PINE JUST
BEFORE ARRIVING AT A TOWN THE CREW ARE GROUPED ON THE FORECASTLE THE
BROAD STAGE IS RUN FAR OUT OVER THE PORT BOW AND AN ENVIED DECKHAND
STANDS PICTURESQUELY ON THE END OF IT WITH A COIL OF ROPE IN HIS HAND
THE PENT STEAM IS SCREAMING THROUGH THE GAUGE COCKS THE CAPTAIN LIFTS
HIS HAND A BELL RINGS THE WHEELS STOP THEN THEY TURN BACK CHURNING
THE WATER TO FOAM AND THE STEAMER IS AT REST
THEN SUCH A SCRAMBLE AS
THERE IS TO GET ABOARD AND TO GET ASHORE AND TO TAKE IN FREIGHT AND TO
DISCHARGE FREIGHT ALL AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME AND SUCH A YELLING
AND CURSING AS THE MATES FACILITATE IT ALL WITH TEN MINUTES LATER THE
STEAMER IS UNDER WAY AGAIN WITH NO FLAG ON THE JACK STAFF AND NO BLACK
SMOKE ISSUING FROM THE CHIMNEYS
AFTER TEN MORE MINUTES THE TOWN IS DEAD
AGAIN AND THE TOWN DRUNKARD ASLEEP BY THE SKIDS ONCE MORE
MY FATHER WAS A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE AND I SUPPOSED HE POSSESSED
THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH OVER ALL MEN AND COULD HANG ANYBODY THAT
OFFENDED HIM
THIS WAS DISTINCTION ENOUGH FOR ME AS A GENERAL THING BUT
THE DESIRE TO BE A STEAMBOATMAN KEPT INTRUDING NEVERTHELESS
I FIRST
WANTED TO BE A CABIN BOY SO THAT I COULD COME OUT WITH A WHITE APRON
ON AND SHAKE A TABLECLOTH OVER THE SIDE WHERE ALL MY OLD COMRADES COULD
SEE ME LATER I THOUGHT I WOULD RATHER BE THE DECKHAND WHO STOOD ON THE
END OF THE STAGE PLANK WITH THE COIL OF ROPE IN HIS HAND BECAUSE HE WAS
PARTICULARLY CONSPICUOUS
BUT THESE WERE ONLY DAY DREAMS THEY WERE TOO
HEAVENLY TO BE CONTEMPLATED AS REAL POSSIBILITIES
BY AND BY ONE OF OUR
BOYS WENT AWAY
HE WAS NOT HEARD OF FOR A LONG TIME
AT LAST HE TURNED
UP AS APPRENTICE ENGINEER OR 'STRIKER' ON A STEAMBOAT
THIS THING SHOOK
THE BOTTOM OUT OF ALL MY SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHINGS
THAT BOY HAD BEEN
NOTORIOUSLY WORLDLY AND I JUST THE REVERSE YET HE WAS EXALTED TO THIS
EMINENCE AND I LEFT IN OBSCURITY AND MISERY
THERE WAS NOTHING GENEROUS
ABOUT THIS FELLOW IN HIS GREATNESS
HE WOULD ALWAYS MANAGE TO HAVE A
RUSTY BOLT TO SCRUB WHILE HIS BOAT TARRIED AT OUR TOWN AND HE WOULD SIT
ON THE INSIDE GUARD AND SCRUB IT WHERE WE COULD ALL SEE HIM AND ENVY
HIM AND LOATHE HIM
AND WHENEVER HIS BOAT WAS LAID UP HE WOULD COME HOME
AND SWELL AROUND THE TOWN IN HIS BLACKEST AND GREASIEST CLOTHES SO THAT
NOBODY COULD HELP REMEMBERING THAT HE WAS A STEAMBOATMAN AND HE USED
ALL SORTS OF STEAMBOAT TECHNICALITIES IN HIS TALK AS IF HE WERE SO USED
TO THEM THAT HE FORGOT COMMON PEOPLE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM
HE WOULD
SPEAK OF THE 'LABBOARD' SIDE OF A HORSE IN AN EASY NATURAL WAY THAT
WOULD MAKE ONE WISH HE WAS DEAD
AND HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT 'ST
LOOY' LIKE AN OLD CITIZEN HE WOULD REFER CASUALLY TO OCCASIONS WHEN
HE 'WAS COMING DOWN FOURTH STREET OR WHEN HE WAS 'PASSING BY THE
PLANTER'S HOUSE OR WHEN THERE WAS A FIRE AND HE TOOK A TURN ON THE
BRAKES OF 'THE OLD BIG MISSOURI AND THEN HE WOULD GO ON AND LIE ABOUT
HOW MANY TOWNS THE SIZE OF OURS WERE BURNED DOWN THERE THAT DAY
TWO
OR THREE OF THE BOYS HAD LONG BEEN PERSONS OF CONSIDERATION AMONG
US BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN TO ST
LOUIS ONCE AND HAD A VAGUE GENERAL
KNOWLEDGE OF ITS WONDERS BUT THE DAY OF THEIR GLORY WAS OVER NOW
THEY
LAPSED INTO A HUMBLE SILENCE AND LEARNED TO DISAPPEAR WHEN THE RUTHLESS
'CUB' ENGINEER APPROACHED
THIS FELLOW HAD MONEY TOO AND HAIR OIL
ALSO AN IGNORANT SILVER WATCH AND A SHOWY BRASS WATCH CHAIN
HE WORE
A LEATHER BELT AND USED NO SUSPENDERS
IF EVER A YOUTH WAS CORDIALLY
ADMIRED AND HATED BY HIS COMRADES THIS ONE WAS
NO GIRL COULD WITHSTAND
HIS CHARMS
HE 'CUT OUT' EVERY BOY IN THE VILLAGE
WHEN HIS BOAT BLEW UP
AT LAST IT DIFFUSED A TRANQUIL CONTENTMENT AMONG US SUCH AS WE HAD NOT
KNOWN FOR MONTHS
BUT WHEN HE CAME HOME THE NEXT WEEK ALIVE RENOWNED
AND APPEARED IN CHURCH ALL BATTERED UP AND BANDAGED A SHINING HERO
STARED AT AND WONDERED OVER BY EVERYBODY IT SEEMED TO US THAT THE
PARTIALITY OF PROVIDENCE FOR AN UNDESERVING REPTILE HAD REACHED A POINT
WHERE IT WAS OPEN TO CRITICISM
THIS CREATURE'S CAREER COULD PRODUCE BUT ONE RESULT AND IT SPEEDILY
FOLLOWED
BOY AFTER BOY MANAGED TO GET ON THE RIVER
THE MINISTER'S SON
BECAME AN ENGINEER
THE DOCTOR'S AND THE POST MASTER'S SONS BECAME 'MUD
CLERKS THE WHOLESALE LIQUOR DEALER'S SON BECAME A BARKEEPER ON A
BOAT FOUR SONS OF THE CHIEF MERCHANT AND TWO SONS OF THE COUNTY JUDGE
BECAME PILOTS
PILOT WAS THE GRANDEST POSITION OF ALL
THE PILOT EVEN
IN THOSE DAYS OF TRIVIAL WAGES HAD A PRINCELY SALARY FROM A HUNDRED
AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH AND NO BOARD TO PAY
TWO MONTHS OF HIS WAGES WOULD PAY A PREACHER'S SALARY FOR A YEAR
NOW
SOME OF US WERE LEFT DISCONSOLATE
WE COULD NOT GET ON THE RIVER AT
LEAST OUR PARENTS WOULD NOT LET US
SO BY AND BY I RAN AWAY
I SAID I NEVER WOULD COME HOME AGAIN TILL I WAS
A PILOT AND COULD COME IN GLORY
BUT SOMEHOW I COULD NOT MANAGE IT
I WENT MEEKLY ABOARD A FEW OF THE BOATS THAT LAY PACKED TOGETHER LIKE
SARDINES AT THE LONG ST
LOUIS WHARF AND VERY HUMBLY INQUIRED FOR THE
PILOTS BUT GOT ONLY A COLD SHOULDER AND SHORT WORDS FROM MATES AND
CLERKS
I HAD TO MAKE THE BEST OF THIS SORT OF TREATMENT FOR THE TIME
BEING BUT I HAD COMFORTING DAYDREAMS OF A FUTURE WHEN I SHOULD BE A
GREAT AND HONORED PILOT WITH PLENTY OF MONEY AND COULD KILL SOME OF
THESE MATES AND CLERKS AND PAY FOR THEM
CHAPTER 5
I WANT TO BE A CUB PILOT
MONTHS AFTERWARD THE HOPE WITHIN ME STRUGGLED TO A RELUCTANT DEATH AND
I FOUND MYSELF WITHOUT AN AMBITION
BUT I WAS ASHAMED TO GO HOME
I WAS
IN CINCINNATI AND I SET TO WORK TO MAP OUT A NEW CAREER
I HAD
BEEN READING ABOUT THE RECENT EXPLORATION OF THE RIVER AMAZON BY AN
EXPEDITION SENT OUT BY OUR GOVERNMENT
IT WAS SAID THAT THE EXPEDITION
OWING TO DIFFICULTIES HAD NOT THOROUGHLY EXPLORED A PART OF THE COUNTRY
LYING ABOUT THE HEAD WATERS SOME FOUR THOUSAND MILES FROM THE MOUTH OF
THE RIVER
IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES FROM CINCINNATI TO
NEW ORLEANS WHERE I COULD DOUBTLESS GET A SHIP
I HAD THIRTY DOLLARS
LEFT I WOULD GO AND COMPLETE THE EXPLORATION OF THE AMAZON
THIS WAS
ALL THE THOUGHT I GAVE TO THE SUBJECT
I NEVER WAS GREAT IN MATTERS OF
DETAIL
I PACKED MY VALISE AND TOOK PASSAGE ON AN ANCIENT TUB CALLED
THE 'PAUL JONES FOR NEW ORLEANS
FOR THE SUM OF SIXTEEN DOLLARS I HAD
THE SCARRED AND TARNISHED SPLENDORS OF 'HER' MAIN SALOON PRINCIPALLY
TO MYSELF FOR SHE WAS NOT A CREATURE TO ATTRACT THE EYE OF WISER
TRAVELERS
WHEN WE PRESENTLY GOT UNDER WAY AND WENT POKING DOWN THE BROAD OHIO
I BECAME A NEW BEING AND THE SUBJECT OF MY OWN ADMIRATION
I WAS A
TRAVELER A WORD NEVER HAD TASTED SO GOOD IN MY MOUTH BEFORE
I HAD AN
EXULTANT SENSE OF BEING BOUND FOR MYSTERIOUS LANDS AND DISTANT CLIMES
WHICH I NEVER HAVE FELT IN SO UPLIFTING A DEGREE SINCE
I WAS IN SUCH A
GLORIFIED CONDITION THAT ALL IGNOBLE FEELINGS DEPARTED OUT OF ME AND I
WAS ABLE TO LOOK DOWN AND PITY THE UNTRAVELED WITH A COMPASSION THAT HAD
HARDLY A TRACE OF CONTEMPT IN IT
STILL WHEN WE STOPPED AT VILLAGES AND
WOOD YARDS I COULD NOT HELP LOLLING CARELESSLY UPON THE RAILINGS OF THE
BOILER DECK TO ENJOY THE ENVY OF THE COUNTRY BOYS ON THE BANK
IF
THEY DID NOT SEEM TO DISCOVER ME I PRESENTLY SNEEZED TO ATTRACT THEIR
ATTENTION OR MOVED TO A POSITION WHERE THEY COULD NOT HELP SEEING ME
AND AS SOON AS I KNEW THEY SAW ME I GAPED AND STRETCHED AND GAVE OTHER
SIGNS OF BEING MIGHTILY BORED WITH TRAVELING
I KEPT MY HAT OFF ALL THE TIME AND STAYED WHERE THE WIND AND THE SUN
COULD STRIKE ME BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET THE BRONZED AND WEATHER BEATEN
LOOK OF AN OLD TRAVELER
BEFORE THE SECOND DAY WAS HALF GONE I
EXPERIENCED A JOY WHICH FILLED ME WITH THE PUREST GRATITUDE FOR I SAW
THAT THE SKIN HAD BEGUN TO BLISTER AND PEEL OFF MY FACE AND NECK
I
WISHED THAT THE BOYS AND GIRLS AT HOME COULD SEE ME NOW
WE REACHED LOUISVILLE IN TIME AT LEAST THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF IT
WE STUCK
HARD AND FAST ON THE ROCKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND LAY THERE
FOUR DAYS
I WAS NOW BEGINNING TO FEEL A STRONG SENSE OF BEING A PART
OF THE BOAT'S FAMILY A SORT OF INFANT SON TO THE CAPTAIN AND YOUNGER
BROTHER TO THE OFFICERS
THERE IS NO ESTIMATING THE PRIDE I TOOK IN THIS
GRANDEUR OR THE AFFECTION THAT BEGAN TO SWELL AND GROW IN ME FOR THOSE
PEOPLE
I COULD NOT KNOW HOW THE LORDLY STEAMBOATMAN SCORNS THAT SORT
OF PRESUMPTION IN A MERE LANDSMAN
I PARTICULARLY LONGED TO ACQUIRE THE
LEAST TRIFLE OF NOTICE FROM THE BIG STORMY MATE AND I WAS ON THE ALERT
FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO HIM A SERVICE TO THAT END
IT CAME AT LAST
THE
RIOTOUS POWWOW OF SETTING A SPAR WAS GOING ON DOWN ON THE FORECASTLE
AND I WENT DOWN THERE AND STOOD AROUND IN THE WAY OR MOSTLY SKIPPING
OUT OF IT TILL THE MATE SUDDENLY ROARED A GENERAL ORDER FOR SOMEBODY TO
BRING HIM A CAPSTAN BAR
I SPRANG TO HIS SIDE AND SAID 'TELL ME WHERE
IT IS I'LL FETCH IT
IF A RAG PICKER HAD OFFERED TO DO A DIPLOMATIC SERVICE FOR THE EMPEROR
OF RUSSIA THE MONARCH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ASTOUNDED THAN THE MATE
WAS
HE EVEN STOPPED SWEARING
HE STOOD AND STARED DOWN AT ME
IT TOOK
HIM TEN SECONDS TO SCRAPE HIS DISJOINTED REMAINS TOGETHER AGAIN
THEN
HE SAID IMPRESSIVELY 'WELL IF THIS DON'T BEAT HELL AND TURNED TO HIS
WORK WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAD BEEN CONFRONTED WITH A PROBLEM TOO
ABSTRUSE FOR SOLUTION
I CREPT AWAY AND COURTED SOLITUDE FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
I DID NOT GO
TO DINNER I STAYED AWAY FROM SUPPER UNTIL EVERYBODY ELSE HAD FINISHED
I DID NOT FEEL SO MUCH LIKE A MEMBER OF THE BOAT'S FAMILY NOW AS BEFORE
HOWEVER MY SPIRITS RETURNED IN INSTALLMENTS AS WE PURSUED OUR WAY
DOWN THE RIVER
I WAS SORRY I HATED THE MATE SO BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN
YOUNG HUMAN NATURE NOT TO ADMIRE HIM
HE WAS HUGE AND MUSCULAR HIS
FACE WAS BEARDED AND WHISKERED ALL OVER HE HAD A RED WOMAN AND A BLUE
WOMAN TATTOOED ON HIS RIGHT ARM ONE ON EACH SIDE OF A BLUE ANCHOR WITH
A RED ROPE TO IT AND IN THE MATTER OF PROFANITY HE WAS SUBLIME
WHEN HE
WAS GETTING OUT CARGO AT A LANDING I WAS ALWAYS WHERE I COULD SEE AND
HEAR
HE FELT ALL THE MAJESTY OF HIS GREAT POSITION AND MADE THE WORLD
FEEL IT TOO
WHEN HE GAVE EVEN THE SIMPLEST ORDER HE DISCHARGED
IT LIKE A BLAST OF LIGHTNING AND SENT A LONG REVERBERATING PEAL OF
PROFANITY THUNDERING AFTER IT
I COULD NOT HELP CONTRASTING THE WAY IN
WHICH THE AVERAGE LANDSMAN WOULD GIVE AN ORDER WITH THE MATE'S WAY
OF DOING IT
IF THE LANDSMAN SHOULD WISH THE GANG PLANK MOVED A FOOT
FARTHER FORWARD HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY 'JAMES OR WILLIAM ONE OF YOU
PUSH THAT PLANK FORWARD PLEASE BUT PUT THE MATE IN HIS PLACE AND HE
WOULD ROAR OUT 'HERE NOW START THAT GANG PLANK FOR'ARD LIVELY NOW
WHAT 'RE YOU ABOUT SNATCH IT SNATCH IT THERE THERE AFT AGAIN AFT
AGAIN DON'T YOU HEAR ME
DASH IT TO DASH ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP OVER
IT VAST HEAVING
'VAST HEAVING I TELL YOU GOING TO HEAVE IT CLEAR
ASTERN WHERE 'RE YOU GOING WITH THAT BARREL FOR'ARD WITH IT 'FORE
I MAKE YOU SWALLOW IT YOU DASH DASH DASH DASHED SPLIT BETWEEN A TIRED
MUD TURTLE AND A CRIPPLED HEARSE HORSE
I WISHED I COULD TALK LIKE THAT
WHEN THE SORENESS OF MY ADVENTURE WITH THE MATE HAD SOMEWHAT WORN OFF
I BEGAN TIMIDLY TO MAKE UP TO THE HUMBLEST OFFICIAL CONNECTED WITH
THE BOAT THE NIGHT WATCHMAN
HE SNUBBED MY ADVANCES AT FIRST BUT I
PRESENTLY VENTURED TO OFFER HIM A NEW CHALK PIPE AND THAT SOFTENED HIM
SO HE ALLOWED ME TO SIT WITH HIM BY THE BIG BELL ON THE HURRICANE DECK
AND IN TIME HE MELTED INTO CONVERSATION
HE COULD NOT WELL HAVE HELPED
IT I HUNG WITH SUCH HOMAGE ON HIS WORDS AND SO PLAINLY SHOWED THAT
I FELT HONORED BY HIS NOTICE
HE TOLD ME THE NAMES OF DIM CAPES AND
SHADOWY ISLANDS AS WE GLIDED BY THEM IN THE SOLEMNITY OF THE NIGHT
UNDER THE WINKING STARS AND BY AND BY GOT TO TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF
HE SEEMED OVER SENTIMENTAL FOR A MAN WHOSE SALARY WAS SIX DOLLARS A
WEEK OR RATHER HE MIGHT HAVE SEEMED SO TO AN OLDER PERSON THAN I
BUT
I DRANK IN HIS WORDS HUNGRILY AND WITH A FAITH THAT MIGHT HAVE MOVED
MOUNTAINS IF IT HAD BEEN APPLIED JUDICIOUSLY
WHAT WAS IT TO ME THAT HE
WAS SOILED AND SEEDY AND FRAGRANT WITH GIN WHAT WAS IT TO ME THAT HIS
GRAMMAR WAS BAD HIS CONSTRUCTION WORSE AND HIS PROFANITY SO VOID
OF ART THAT IT WAS AN ELEMENT OF WEAKNESS RATHER THAN STRENGTH IN HIS
CONVERSATION HE WAS A WRONGED MAN A MAN WHO HAD SEEN TROUBLE AND THAT
WAS ENOUGH FOR ME
AS HE MELLOWED INTO HIS PLAINTIVE HISTORY HIS TEARS
DRIPPED UPON THE LANTERN IN HIS LAP AND I CRIED TOO FROM SYMPATHY
HE SAID HE WAS THE SON OF AN ENGLISH NOBLEMAN EITHER AN EARL OR AN
ALDERMAN HE COULD NOT REMEMBER WHICH BUT BELIEVED WAS BOTH HIS
FATHER THE NOBLEMAN LOVED HIM BUT HIS MOTHER HATED HIM FROM THE
CRADLE AND SO WHILE HE WAS STILL A LITTLE BOY HE WAS SENT TO 'ONE OF
THEM OLD ANCIENT COLLEGES' HE COULDN'T REMEMBER WHICH AND BY AND BY
HIS FATHER DIED AND HIS MOTHER SEIZED THE PROPERTY AND 'SHOOK' HIM AS
HE PHRASED IT
AFTER HIS MOTHER SHOOK HIM MEMBERS OF THE NOBILITY WITH
WHOM HE WAS ACQUAINTED USED THEIR INFLUENCE TO GET HIM THE POSITION OF
'LOBLOLLY BOY IN A SHIP AND FROM THAT POINT MY WATCHMAN THREW OFF ALL
TRAMMELS OF DATE AND LOCALITY AND BRANCHED OUT INTO A NARRATIVE THAT
BRISTLED ALL ALONG WITH INCREDIBLE ADVENTURES A NARRATIVE THAT WAS SO
REEKING WITH BLOODSHED AND SO CRAMMED WITH HAIR BREADTH ESCAPES AND
THE MOST ENGAGING AND UNCONSCIOUS PERSONAL VILLAINIES THAT I SAT
SPEECHLESS ENJOYING SHUDDERING WONDERING WORSHIPPING
IT WAS A SORE BLIGHT TO FIND OUT AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS A LOW VULGAR
IGNORANT SENTIMENTAL HALF WITTED HUMBUG AN UNTRAVELED NATIVE OF THE
WILDS OF ILLINOIS WHO HAD ABSORBED WILDCAT LITERATURE AND APPROPRIATED
ITS MARVELS UNTIL IN TIME HE HAD WOVEN ODDS AND ENDS OF THE MESS INTO
THIS YARN AND THEN GONE ON TELLING IT TO FLEDGLINGS LIKE ME UNTIL HE
HAD COME TO BELIEVE IT HIMSELF
CHAPTER 6
A CUB PILOT'S EXPERIENCE
WHAT WITH LYING ON THE ROCKS FOUR DAYS AT LOUISVILLE AND SOME OTHER
DELAYS THE POOR OLD 'PAUL JONES' FOOLED AWAY ABOUT TWO WEEKS IN MAKING
THE VOYAGE FROM CINCINNATI TO NEW ORLEANS
THIS GAVE ME A CHANCE TO GET
ACQUAINTED WITH ONE OF THE PILOTS AND HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO STEER THE
BOAT AND THUS MADE THE FASCINATION OF RIVER LIFE MORE POTENT THAN EVER
FOR ME
IT ALSO GAVE ME A CHANCE TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH A YOUTH WHO HAD TAKEN
DECK PASSAGE MORE'S THE PITY FOR HE EASILY BORROWED SIX DOLLARS OF ME
ON A PROMISE TO RETURN TO THE BOAT AND PAY IT BACK TO ME THE DAY AFTER
WE SHOULD ARRIVE
BUT HE PROBABLY DIED OR FORGOT FOR HE NEVER CAME
IT
WAS DOUBTLESS THE FORMER SINCE HE HAD SAID HIS PARENTS WERE WEALTHY
AND HE ONLY TRAVELED DECK PASSAGE BECAUSE IT WAS COOLER FOOTNOTE 1
'DECK' PASSAGE I E
STEERAGE PASSAGE
I SOON DISCOVERED TWO THINGS
ONE WAS THAT A VESSEL WOULD NOT BE LIKELY
TO SAIL FOR THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON UNDER TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND THE
OTHER WAS THAT THE NINE OR TEN DOLLARS STILL LEFT IN MY POCKET WOULD NOT
SUFFICE FOR SO IMPOSING AN EXPLORATION AS I HAD PLANNED EVEN IF I COULD
AFFORD TO WAIT FOR A SHIP
THEREFORE IT FOLLOWED THAT I MUST CONTRIVE
A NEW CAREER
THE 'PAUL JONES' WAS NOW BOUND FOR ST
LOUIS
I PLANNED
A SIEGE AGAINST MY PILOT AND AT THE END OF THREE HARD DAYS HE
SURRENDERED
HE AGREED TO TEACH ME THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER FROM NEW
ORLEANS TO ST
LOUIS FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PAYABLE OUT OF THE
FIRST WAGES I SHOULD RECEIVE AFTER GRADUATING
I ENTERED UPON THE SMALL
ENTERPRISE OF 'LEARNING' TWELVE OR THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF THE GREAT
MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH THE EASY CONFIDENCE OF MY TIME OF LIFE
IF I HAD
REALLY KNOWN WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO REQUIRE OF MY FACULTIES I SHOULD NOT
HAVE HAD THE COURAGE TO BEGIN
I SUPPOSED THAT ALL A PILOT HAD TO DO WAS
TO KEEP HIS BOAT IN THE RIVER AND I DID NOT CONSIDER THAT THAT COULD BE
MUCH OF A TRICK SINCE IT WAS SO WIDE
THE BOAT BACKED OUT FROM NEW ORLEANS AT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON AND IT
WAS 'OUR WATCH' UNTIL EIGHT
MR
BIXBY MY CHIEF 'STRAIGHTENED HER
UP PLOWED HER ALONG PAST THE STERNS OF THE OTHER BOATS THAT LAY AT THE
LEVEE AND THEN SAID 'HERE TAKE HER SHAVE THOSE STEAMSHIPS AS CLOSE
AS YOU'D PEEL AN APPLE I TOOK THE WHEEL AND MY HEART BEAT FLUTTERED
UP INTO THE HUNDREDS FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO SCRAPE
THE SIDE OFF EVERY SHIP IN THE LINE WE WERE SO CLOSE
I HELD MY BREATH
AND BEGAN TO CLAW THE BOAT AWAY FROM THE DANGER AND I HAD MY OWN
OPINION OF THE PILOT WHO HAD KNOWN NO BETTER THAN TO GET US INTO SUCH
PERIL BUT I WAS TOO WISE TO EXPRESS IT
IN HALF A MINUTE I HAD A WIDE
MARGIN OF SAFETY INTERVENING BETWEEN THE 'PAUL JONES' AND THE SHIPS AND
WITHIN TEN SECONDS MORE I WAS SET ASIDE IN DISGRACE AND MR
BIXBY WAS
GOING INTO DANGER AGAIN AND FLAYING ME ALIVE WITH ABUSE OF MY COWARDICE
I WAS STUNG BUT I WAS OBLIGED TO ADMIRE THE EASY CONFIDENCE WITH WHICH
MY CHIEF LOAFED FROM SIDE TO SIDE OF HIS WHEEL AND TRIMMED THE SHIPS SO
CLOSELY THAT DISASTER SEEMED CEASELESSLY IMMINENT
WHEN HE HAD COOLED A
LITTLE HE TOLD ME THAT THE EASY WATER WAS CLOSE ASHORE AND THE CURRENT
OUTSIDE AND THEREFORE WE MUST HUG THE BANK UP STREAM TO GET THE
BENEFIT OF THE FORMER AND STAY WELL OUT DOWN STREAM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE LATTER
IN MY OWN MIND I RESOLVED TO BE A DOWN STREAM PILOT AND
LEAVE THE UP STREAMING TO PEOPLE DEAD TO PRUDENCE
NOW AND THEN MR
BIXBY CALLED MY ATTENTION TO CERTAIN THINGS
SAID
HE 'THIS IS SIX MILE POINT I ASSENTED
IT WAS PLEASANT ENOUGH
INFORMATION BUT I COULD NOT SEE THE BEARING OF IT
I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS
THAT IT WAS A MATTER OF ANY INTEREST TO ME
ANOTHER TIME HE SAID 'THIS
IS NINE MILE POINT LATER HE SAID 'THIS IS TWELVE MILE POINT THEY
WERE ALL ABOUT LEVEL WITH THE WATER'S EDGE THEY ALL LOOKED ABOUT ALIKE
TO ME THEY WERE MONOTONOUSLY UNPICTURESQUE
I HOPED MR
BIXBY WOULD
CHANGE THE SUBJECT
BUT NO HE WOULD CROWD UP AROUND A POINT HUGGING
THE SHORE WITH AFFECTION AND THEN SAY 'THE SLACK WATER ENDS HERE
ABREAST THIS BUNCH OF CHINA TREES NOW WE CROSS OVER SO HE CROSSED
OVER
HE GAVE ME THE WHEEL ONCE OR TWICE BUT I HAD NO LUCK
I EITHER
CAME NEAR CHIPPING OFF THE EDGE OF A SUGAR PLANTATION OR I YAWED TOO
FAR FROM SHORE AND SO DROPPED BACK INTO DISGRACE AGAIN AND GOT ABUSED
THE WATCH WAS ENDED AT LAST AND WE TOOK SUPPER AND WENT TO BED
AT
MIDNIGHT THE GLARE OF A LANTERN SHONE IN MY EYES AND THE NIGHT WATCHMAN
SAID
'COME TURN OUT
AND THEN HE LEFT
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS EXTRAORDINARY PROCEDURE
SO I PRESENTLY GAVE UP TRYING TO AND DOZED OFF TO SLEEP
PRETTY SOON
THE WATCHMAN WAS BACK AGAIN AND THIS TIME HE WAS GRUFF
I WAS ANNOYED
I SAID
'WHAT DO YOU WANT TO COME BOTHERING AROUND HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT FOR
NOW AS LIKE AS NOT I'LL NOT GET TO SLEEP AGAIN TO NIGHT
THE WATCHMAN SAID
'WELL IF THIS AN'T GOOD I'M BLEST
THE 'OFF WATCH' WAS JUST TURNING IN AND I HEARD SOME BRUTAL LAUGHTER
FROM THEM AND SUCH REMARKS AS 'HELLO WATCHMAN AN'T THE NEW CUB TURNED
OUT YET HE'S DELICATE LIKELY
GIVE HIM SOME SUGAR IN A RAG AND SEND
FOR THE CHAMBERMAID TO SING ROCK A BY BABY TO HIM
ABOUT THIS TIME MR
BIXBY APPEARED ON THE SCENE
SOMETHING LIKE A MINUTE
LATER I WAS CLIMBING THE PILOT HOUSE STEPS WITH SOME OF MY CLOTHES ON
AND THE REST IN MY ARMS
MR
BIXBY WAS CLOSE BEHIND COMMENTING
HERE
WAS SOMETHING FRESH THIS THING OF GETTING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
TO GO TO WORK
IT WAS A DETAIL IN PILOTING THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO
ME AT ALL
I KNEW THAT BOATS RAN ALL NIGHT BUT SOMEHOW I HAD NEVER
HAPPENED TO REFLECT THAT SOMEBODY HAD TO GET UP OUT OF A WARM BED TO RUN
THEM
I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PILOTING WAS NOT QUITE SO ROMANTIC AS I HAD
IMAGINED IT WAS THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY REAL AND WORK LIKE ABOUT THIS
NEW PHASE OF IT
IT WAS A RATHER DINGY NIGHT ALTHOUGH A FAIR NUMBER OF STARS WERE OUT
THE BIG MATE WAS AT THE WHEEL AND HE HAD THE OLD TUB POINTED AT A STAR
AND WAS HOLDING HER STRAIGHT UP THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
THE SHORES ON
EITHER HAND WERE NOT MUCH MORE THAN HALF A MILE APART BUT THEY SEEMED
WONDERFULLY FAR AWAY AND EVER SO VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
THE MATE SAID
'WE'VE GOT TO LAND AT JONES'S PLANTATION SIR
THE VENGEFUL SPIRIT IN ME EXULTED
I SAID TO MYSELF I WISH YOU JOY
OF YOUR JOB MR
BIXBY YOU'LL HAVE A GOOD TIME FINDING MR
JONES'S
PLANTATION SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS AND I HOPE YOU NEVER WILL FIND IT AS
LONG AS YOU LIVE
MR
BIXBY SAID TO THE MATE
'UPPER END OF THE PLANTATION OR THE LOWER
'UPPER
'I CAN'T DO IT
THE STUMPS THERE ARE OUT OF WATER AT THIS STAGE IT'S NO
GREAT DISTANCE TO THE LOWER AND YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ALONG WITH THAT
'ALL RIGHT SIR
IF JONES DON'T LIKE IT HE'LL HAVE TO LUMP IT I
RECKON
AND THEN THE MATE LEFT
MY EXULTATION BEGAN TO COOL AND MY WONDER TO
COME UP
HERE WAS A MAN WHO NOT ONLY PROPOSED TO FIND THIS PLANTATION ON
SUCH A NIGHT BUT TO FIND EITHER END OF IT YOU PREFERRED
I DREADFULLY
WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION BUT I WAS CARRYING ABOUT AS MANY SHORT ANSWERS
AS MY CARGO ROOM WOULD ADMIT OF SO I HELD MY PEACE
ALL I DESIRED
TO ASK MR
BIXBY WAS THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHETHER HE WAS ASS ENOUGH TO
REALLY IMAGINE HE WAS GOING TO FIND THAT PLANTATION ON A NIGHT WHEN ALL
PLANTATIONS WERE EXACTLY ALIKE AND ALL THE SAME COLOR
BUT I HELD IN
I
USED TO HAVE FINE INSPIRATIONS OF PRUDENCE IN THOSE DAYS
MR
BIXBY MADE FOR THE SHORE AND SOON WAS SCRAPING IT JUST THE SAME AS
IF IT HAD BEEN DAYLIGHT
AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT SINGING
'FATHER IN HEAVEN THE DAY IS DECLINING ETC
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD PUT MY LIFE IN THE KEEPING OF A PECULIARLY
RECKLESS OUTCAST
PRESENTLY HE TURNED ON ME AND SAID
'WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE FIRST POINT ABOVE NEW ORLEANS
I WAS GRATIFIED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER PROMPTLY AND I DID
I SAID I
DIDN'T KNOW
'DON'T KNOW
THIS MANNER JOLTED ME
I WAS DOWN AT THE FOOT AGAIN IN A MOMENT
BUT I
HAD TO SAY JUST WHAT I HAD SAID BEFORE
'WELL YOU'RE A SMART ONE SAID MR
BIXBY
'WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE
NEXT POINT
ONCE MORE I DIDN'T KNOW
'WELL THIS BEATS ANYTHING
TELL ME THE NAME OF ANY POINT OR PLACE I
TOLD YOU
I STUDIED A WHILE AND DECIDED THAT I COULDN'T
'LOOK HERE WHAT DO YOU START OUT FROM ABOVE TWELVE MILE POINT TO
CROSS OVER
'I I DON'T KNOW
'YOU YOU DON'T KNOW MIMICKING MY DRAWLING MANNER OF SPEECH
'WHAT
DO YOU KNOW
'I I NOTHING FOR CERTAIN
'BY THE GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST I BELIEVE YOU YOU'RE THE STUPIDEST
DUNDERHEAD I EVER SAW OR EVER HEARD OF SO HELP ME MOSES THE IDEA OF
YOU BEING A PILOT YOU WHY YOU DON'T KNOW ENOUGH TO PILOT A COW DOWN A
LANE
OH BUT HIS WRATH WAS UP HE WAS A NERVOUS MAN AND HE SHUFFLED FROM ONE
SIDE OF HIS WHEEL TO THE OTHER AS IF THE FLOOR WAS HOT
HE WOULD BOIL A
WHILE TO HIMSELF AND THEN OVERFLOW AND SCALD ME AGAIN
'LOOK HERE WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE I TOLD YOU THE NAMES OF THOSE POINTS
FOR
I TREMBLINGLY CONSIDERED A MOMENT AND THEN THE DEVIL OF TEMPTATION
PROVOKED ME TO SAY
'WELL TO TO BE ENTERTAINING I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A RED RAG TO THE BULL
HE RAGED AND STORMED SO HE WAS CROSSING
THE RIVER AT THE TIME THAT I JUDGE IT MADE HIM BLIND BECAUSE HE RAN
OVER THE STEERING OAR OF A TRADING SCOW
OF COURSE THE TRADERS SENT UP
A VOLLEY OF RED HOT PROFANITY
NEVER WAS A MAN SO GRATEFUL AS MR
BIXBY
WAS BECAUSE HE WAS BRIM FULL AND HERE WERE SUBJECTS WHO WOULD
TALK BACK
HE THREW OPEN A WINDOW THRUST HIS HEAD OUT AND SUCH AN
IRRUPTION FOLLOWED AS I NEVER HAD HEARD BEFORE
THE FAINTER AND FARTHER
AWAY THE SCOWMEN'S CURSES DRIFTED THE HIGHER MR
BIXBY LIFTED HIS VOICE
AND THE WEIGHTIER HIS ADJECTIVES GREW
WHEN HE CLOSED THE WINDOW HE WAS
EMPTY
YOU COULD HAVE DRAWN A SEINE THROUGH HIS SYSTEM AND NOT CAUGHT
CURSES ENOUGH TO DISTURB YOUR MOTHER WITH
PRESENTLY HE SAID TO ME IN
THE GENTLEST WAY
'MY BOY YOU MUST GET A LITTLE MEMORANDUM BOOK AND EVERY TIME I TELL
YOU A THING PUT IT DOWN RIGHT AWAY
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO BE A PILOT
AND THAT IS TO GET THIS ENTIRE RIVER BY HEART
YOU HAVE TO KNOW IT JUST
LIKE A B C
THAT WAS A DISMAL REVELATION TO ME FOR MY MEMORY WAS NEVER LOADED WITH
ANYTHING BUT BLANK CARTRIDGES
HOWEVER I DID NOT FEEL DISCOURAGED LONG
I JUDGED THAT IT WAS BEST TO MAKE SOME ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTLESS MR
BIXBY WAS 'STRETCHING PRESENTLY HE PULLED A ROPE AND STRUCK A FEW
STROKES ON THE BIG BELL
THE STARS WERE ALL GONE NOW AND THE NIGHT WAS
AS BLACK AS INK
I COULD HEAR THE WHEELS CHURN ALONG THE BANK BUT I
WAS NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN THAT I COULD SEE THE SHORE
THE VOICE OF THE
INVISIBLE WATCHMAN CALLED UP FROM THE HURRICANE DECK
'WHAT'S THIS SIR
'JONES'S PLANTATION
I SAID TO MYSELF I WISH I MIGHT VENTURE TO OFFER A SMALL BET THAT IT
ISN'T
BUT I DID NOT CHIRP
I ONLY WAITED TO SEE
MR
BIXBY HANDLED THE
ENGINE BELLS AND IN DUE TIME THE BOAT'S NOSE CAME TO THE LAND A TORCH
GLOWED FROM THE FORECASTLE A MAN SKIPPED ASHORE A DARKY'S VOICE ON THE
BANK SAID 'GIMME DE K'YARPET BAG MARS' JONES AND THE NEXT MOMENT WE
WERE STANDING UP THE RIVER AGAIN ALL SERENE
I REFLECTED DEEPLY AWHILE
AND THEN SAID BUT NOT ALOUD 'WELL THE FINDING OF THAT PLANTATION WAS
THE LUCKIEST ACCIDENT THAT EVER HAPPENED BUT IT COULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN
IN A HUNDRED YEARS AND I FULLY BELIEVED IT WAS AN ACCIDENT TOO
BY THE TIME WE HAD GONE SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED MILES UP THE RIVER I HAD
LEARNED TO BE A TOLERABLY PLUCKY UP STREAM STEERSMAN IN DAYLIGHT
AND BEFORE WE REACHED ST
LOUIS I HAD MADE A TRIFLE OF PROGRESS IN
NIGHT WORK BUT ONLY A TRIFLE
I HAD A NOTE BOOK THAT FAIRLY BRISTLED
WITH THE NAMES OF TOWNS 'POINTS BARS ISLANDS BENDS REACHES ETC
BUT THE INFORMATION WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY IN THE NOTEBOOK NONE OF IT WAS
IN MY HEAD
IT MADE MY HEART ACHE TO THINK I HAD ONLY GOT HALF OF THE
RIVER SET DOWN FOR AS OUR WATCH WAS FOUR HOURS OFF AND FOUR HOURS ON
DAY AND NIGHT THERE WAS A LONG FOUR HOUR GAP IN MY BOOK FOR EVERY TIME
I HAD SLEPT SINCE THE VOYAGE BEGAN
MY CHIEF WAS PRESENTLY HIRED TO GO ON A BIG NEW ORLEANS BOAT AND I
PACKED MY SATCHEL AND WENT WITH HIM
SHE WAS A GRAND AFFAIR
WHEN I
STOOD IN HER PILOT HOUSE I WAS SO FAR ABOVE THE WATER THAT I SEEMED
PERCHED ON A MOUNTAIN AND HER DECKS STRETCHED SO FAR AWAY FORE AND
AFT BELOW ME THAT I WONDERED HOW I COULD EVER HAVE CONSIDERED THE
LITTLE 'PAUL JONES' A LARGE CRAFT
THERE WERE OTHER DIFFERENCES TOO
THE 'PAUL JONES'S' PILOT HOUSE WAS A CHEAP DINGY BATTERED RATTLE TRAP
CRAMPED FOR ROOM BUT HERE WAS A SUMPTUOUS GLASS TEMPLE ROOM ENOUGH TO
HAVE A DANCE IN SHOWY RED AND GOLD WINDOW CURTAINS AN IMPOSING SOFA
LEATHER CUSHIONS AND A BACK TO THE HIGH BENCH WHERE VISITING PILOTS SIT
TO SPIN YARNS AND 'LOOK AT THE RIVER BRIGHT FANCIFUL 'CUSPADORES'
INSTEAD OF A BROAD WOODEN BOX FILLED WITH SAWDUST NICE NEW OIL CLOTH
ON THE FLOOR A HOSPITABLE BIG STOVE FOR WINTER A WHEEL AS HIGH AS MY
HEAD COSTLY WITH INLAID WORK A WIRE TILLER ROPE BRIGHT BRASS KNOBS
FOR THE BELLS AND A TIDY WHITE APRONED BLACK 'TEXAS TENDER TO BRING
UP TARTS AND ICES AND COFFEE DURING MID WATCH DAY AND NIGHT
NOW THIS
WAS 'SOMETHING LIKE AND SO I BEGAN TO TAKE HEART ONCE MORE TO BELIEVE
THAT PILOTING WAS A ROMANTIC SORT OF OCCUPATION AFTER ALL
THE MOMENT WE
WERE UNDER WAY I BEGAN TO PROWL ABOUT THE GREAT STEAMER AND FILL MYSELF
WITH JOY
SHE WAS AS CLEAN AND AS DAINTY AS A DRAWING ROOM WHEN I
LOOKED DOWN HER LONG GILDED SALOON IT WAS LIKE GAZING THROUGH A
SPLENDID TUNNEL SHE HAD AN OIL PICTURE BY SOME GIFTED SIGN PAINTER
ON EVERY STATEROOM DOOR SHE GLITTERED WITH NO END OF PRISM FRINGED
CHANDELIERS THE CLERK'S OFFICE WAS ELEGANT THE BAR WAS MARVELOUS AND
THE BAR KEEPER HAD BEEN BARBERED AND UPHOLSTERED AT INCREDIBLE COST
THE BOILER DECK I E
THE SECOND STORY OF THE BOAT SO TO SPEAK WAS AS
SPACIOUS AS A CHURCH IT SEEMED TO ME SO WITH THE FORECASTLE AND
THERE WAS NO PITIFUL HANDFUL OF DECKHANDS FIREMEN AND ROUSTABOUTS DOWN
THERE BUT A WHOLE BATTALION OF MEN
THE FIRES WERE FIERCELY GLARING
FROM A LONG ROW OF FURNACES AND OVER THEM WERE EIGHT HUGE BOILERS
THIS WAS UNUTTERABLE POMP
THE MIGHTY ENGINES BUT ENOUGH OF THIS
I HAD
NEVER FELT SO FINE BEFORE
AND WHEN I FOUND THAT THE REGIMENT OF NATTY
SERVANTS RESPECTFULLY 'SIR'D' ME MY SATISFACTION WAS COMPLETE
CHAPTER 7
A DARING DEED
WHEN I RETURNED TO THE PILOT HOUSE ST
LOUIS WAS GONE AND I WAS LOST
HERE WAS A PIECE OF RIVER WHICH WAS ALL DOWN IN MY BOOK BUT I COULD
MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT YOU UNDERSTAND IT WAS TURNED AROUND
I HAD SEEN IT WHEN COMING UP STREAM BUT I HAD NEVER FACED ABOUT TO SEE
HOW IT LOOKED WHEN IT WAS BEHIND ME
MY HEART BROKE AGAIN FOR IT WAS
PLAIN THAT I HAD GOT TO LEARN THIS TROUBLESOME RIVER BOTH WAYS
THE PILOT HOUSE WAS FULL OF PILOTS GOING DOWN TO 'LOOK AT THE RIVER
WHAT IS CALLED THE 'UPPER RIVER' THE TWO HUNDRED MILES BETWEEN ST
LOUIS AND CAIRO WHERE THE OHIO COMES IN WAS LOW AND THE MISSISSIPPI
CHANGES ITS CHANNEL SO CONSTANTLY THAT THE PILOTS USED TO ALWAYS FIND
IT NECESSARY TO RUN DOWN TO CAIRO TO TAKE A FRESH LOOK WHEN THEIR BOATS
WERE TO LIE IN PORT A WEEK THAT IS WHEN THE WATER WAS AT A LOW STAGE
A DEAL OF THIS 'LOOKING AT THE RIVER' WAS DONE BY POOR FELLOWS WHO
SELDOM HAD A BERTH AND WHOSE ONLY HOPE OF GETTING ONE LAY IN THEIR
BEING ALWAYS FRESHLY POSTED AND THEREFORE READY TO DROP INTO THE SHOES
OF SOME REPUTABLE PILOT FOR A SINGLE TRIP ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH PILOT'S
SUDDEN ILLNESS OR SOME OTHER NECESSITY
AND A GOOD MANY OF THEM
CONSTANTLY RAN UP AND DOWN INSPECTING THE RIVER NOT BECAUSE THEY EVER
REALLY HOPED TO GET A BERTH BUT BECAUSE THEY BEING GUESTS OF THE BOAT
IT WAS CHEAPER TO 'LOOK AT THE RIVER' THAN STAY ASHORE AND PAY BOARD
IN
TIME THESE FELLOWS GREW DAINTY IN THEIR TASTES AND ONLY INFESTED BOATS
THAT HAD AN ESTABLISHED REPUTATION FOR SETTING GOOD TABLES
ALL VISITING
PILOTS WERE USEFUL FOR THEY WERE ALWAYS READY AND WILLING WINTER OR
SUMMER NIGHT OR DAY TO GO OUT IN THE YAWL AND HELP BUOY THE CHANNEL
OR ASSIST THE BOAT'S PILOTS IN ANY WAY THEY COULD
THEY WERE LIKEWISE
WELCOME BECAUSE ALL PILOTS ARE TIRELESS TALKERS WHEN GATHERED TOGETHER
AND AS THEY TALK ONLY ABOUT THE RIVER THEY ARE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD AND
ARE ALWAYS INTERESTING
YOUR TRUE PILOT CARES NOTHING ABOUT ANYTHING ON
EARTH BUT THE RIVER AND HIS PRIDE IN HIS OCCUPATION SURPASSES THE PRIDE
OF KINGS
WE HAD A FINE COMPANY OF THESE RIVER INSPECTORS ALONG THIS TRIP
THERE
WERE EIGHT OR TEN AND THERE WAS ABUNDANCE OF ROOM FOR THEM IN OUR GREAT
PILOT HOUSE
TWO OR THREE OF THEM WORE POLISHED SILK HATS ELABORATE
SHIRT FRONTS DIAMOND BREAST PINS KID GLOVES AND PATENT LEATHER BOOTS
THEY WERE CHOICE IN THEIR ENGLISH AND BORE THEMSELVES WITH A DIGNITY
PROPER TO MEN OF SOLID MEANS AND PRODIGIOUS REPUTATION AS PILOTS
THE
OTHERS WERE MORE OR LESS LOOSELY CLAD AND WORE UPON THEIR HEADS TALL
FELT CONES THAT WERE SUGGESTIVE OF THE DAYS OF THE COMMONWEALTH
I WAS A CIPHER IN THIS AUGUST COMPANY AND FELT SUBDUED NOT TO SAY
TORPID
I WAS NOT EVEN OF SUFFICIENT CONSEQUENCE TO ASSIST AT THE WHEEL
WHEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO PUT THE TILLER HARD DOWN IN A HURRY THE GUEST
THAT STOOD NEAREST DID THAT WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED AND THIS WAS PRETTY
MUCH ALL THE TIME BECAUSE OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE CHANNEL AND THE
SCANT WATER
I STOOD IN A CORNER AND THE TALK I LISTENED TO TOOK THE
HOPE ALL OUT OF ME
ONE VISITOR SAID TO ANOTHER
'JIM HOW DID YOU RUN PLUM POINT COMING UP
'IT WAS IN THE NIGHT THERE AND I RAN IT THE WAY ONE OF THE BOYS ON THE
DIANA TOLD ME STARTED OUT ABOUT FIFTY YARDS ABOVE THE WOOD PILE ON
THE FALSE POINT AND HELD ON THE CABIN UNDER PLUM POINT TILL I RAISED
THE REEF QUARTER LESS TWAIN THEN STRAIGHTENED UP FOR THE MIDDLE BAR
TILL I GOT WELL ABREAST THE OLD ONE LIMBED COTTON WOOD IN THE BEND
THEN GOT MY STERN ON THE COTTON WOOD AND HEAD ON THE LOW PLACE ABOVE THE
POINT AND CAME THROUGH A BOOMING NINE AND A HALF
'PRETTY SQUARE CROSSING AN'T IT
'YES BUT THE UPPER BAR 'S WORKING DOWN FAST
ANOTHER PILOT SPOKE UP AND SAID
'I HAD BETTER WATER THAN THAT AND RAN IT LOWER DOWN STARTED OUT FROM
THE FALSE POINT MARK TWAIN RAISED THE SECOND REEF ABREAST THE BIG SNAG
IN THE BEND AND HAD QUARTER LESS TWAIN
ONE OF THE GORGEOUS ONES REMARKED
'I DON'T WANT TO FIND FAULT WITH YOUR LEADSMEN BUT THAT'S A GOOD DEAL
OF WATER FOR PLUM POINT IT SEEMS TO ME
THERE WAS AN APPROVING NOD ALL AROUND AS THIS QUIET SNUB DROPPED ON
THE BOASTER AND 'SETTLED' HIM
AND SO THEY WENT ON TALK TALK TALKING
MEANTIME THE THING THAT WAS RUNNING IN MY MIND WAS 'NOW IF MY EARS
HEAR ARIGHT I HAVE NOT ONLY TO GET THE NAMES OF ALL THE TOWNS AND
ISLANDS AND BENDS AND SO ON BY HEART BUT I MUST EVEN GET UP A WARM
PERSONAL ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH EVERY OLD SNAG AND ONE LIMBED COTTON WOOD
AND OBSCURE WOOD PILE THAT ORNAMENTS THE BANKS OF THIS RIVER FOR TWELVE
HUNDRED MILES AND MORE THAN THAT I MUST ACTUALLY KNOW WHERE THESE
THINGS ARE IN THE DARK UNLESS THESE GUESTS ARE GIFTED WITH EYES THAT
CAN PIERCE THROUGH TWO MILES OF SOLID BLACKNESS I WISH THE PILOTING
BUSINESS WAS IN JERICHO AND I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF IT
AT DUSK MR
BIXBY TAPPED THE BIG BELL THREE TIMES THE SIGNAL TO LAND
AND THE CAPTAIN EMERGED FROM HIS DRAWING ROOM IN THE FORWARD END OF THE
TEXAS AND LOOKED UP INQUIRINGLY
MR
BIXBY SAID
'WE WILL LAY UP HERE ALL NIGHT CAPTAIN
'VERY WELL SIR
THAT WAS ALL
THE BOAT CAME TO SHORE AND WAS TIED UP FOR THE NIGHT
IT
SEEMED TO ME A FINE THING THAT THE PILOT COULD DO AS HE PLEASED WITHOUT
ASKING SO GRAND A CAPTAIN'S PERMISSION
I TOOK MY SUPPER AND
WENT IMMEDIATELY TO BED DISCOURAGED BY MY DAY'S OBSERVATIONS AND
EXPERIENCES
MY LATE VOYAGE'S NOTE BOOKING WAS BUT A CONFUSION OF
MEANINGLESS NAMES
IT HAD TANGLED ME ALL UP IN A KNOT EVERY TIME I HAD
LOOKED AT IT IN THE DAYTIME
I NOW HOPED FOR RESPITE IN SLEEP BUT
NO IT REVELED ALL THROUGH MY HEAD TILL SUNRISE AGAIN A FRANTIC AND
TIRELESS NIGHTMARE
NEXT MORNING I FELT PRETTY RUSTY AND LOW SPIRITED
WE WENT BOOMING
ALONG TAKING A GOOD MANY CHANCES FOR WE WERE ANXIOUS TO 'GET OUT OF
THE RIVER' AS GETTING OUT TO CAIRO WAS CALLED BEFORE NIGHT SHOULD
OVERTAKE US
BUT MR
BIXBY'S PARTNER THE OTHER PILOT PRESENTLY
GROUNDED THE BOAT AND WE LOST SO MUCH TIME IN GETTING HER OFF THAT
IT WAS PLAIN THAT DARKNESS WOULD OVERTAKE US A GOOD LONG WAY ABOVE
THE MOUTH
THIS WAS A GREAT MISFORTUNE ESPECIALLY TO CERTAIN OF OUR
VISITING PILOTS WHOSE BOATS WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEIR RETURN NO
MATTER HOW LONG THAT MIGHT BE
IT SOBERED THE PILOT HOUSE TALK A GOOD
DEAL
COMING UP STREAM PILOTS DID NOT MIND LOW WATER OR ANY KIND
OF DARKNESS NOTHING STOPPED THEM BUT FOG
BUT DOWN STREAM WORK WAS
DIFFERENT A BOAT WAS TOO NEARLY HELPLESS WITH A STIFF CURRENT PUSHING
BEHIND HER SO IT WAS NOT CUSTOMARY TO RUN DOWN STREAM AT NIGHT IN LOW
WATER
THERE SEEMED TO BE ONE SMALL HOPE HOWEVER IF WE COULD GET THROUGH
THE INTRICATE AND DANGEROUS HAT ISLAND CROSSING BEFORE NIGHT WE COULD
VENTURE THE REST FOR WE WOULD HAVE PLAINER SAILING AND BETTER WATER
BUT IT WOULD BE INSANITY TO ATTEMPT HAT ISLAND AT NIGHT
SO THERE WAS
A DEAL OF LOOKING AT WATCHES ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND A CONSTANT
CIPHERING UPON THE SPEED WE WERE MAKING HAT ISLAND WAS THE ETERNAL
SUBJECT SOMETIMES HOPE WAS HIGH AND SOMETIMES WE WERE DELAYED IN A
BAD CROSSING AND DOWN IT WENT AGAIN
FOR HOURS ALL HANDS LAY UNDER THE
BURDEN OF THIS SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT IT WAS EVEN COMMUNICATED TO ME
AND I GOT TO FEELING SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT HAT ISLAND AND UNDER SUCH
AN AWFUL PRESSURE OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT I WISHED I MIGHT HAVE FIVE
MINUTES ON SHORE TO DRAW A GOOD FULL RELIEVING BREATH AND START OVER
AGAIN
WE WERE STANDING NO REGULAR WATCHES
EACH OF OUR PILOTS RAN SUCH
PORTIONS OF THE RIVER AS HE HAD RUN WHEN COMING UP STREAM BECAUSE OF
HIS GREATER FAMILIARITY WITH IT BUT BOTH REMAINED IN THE PILOT HOUSE
CONSTANTLY
AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET MR
BIXBY TOOK THE WHEEL AND MR
W STEPPED
ASIDE
FOR THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES EVERY MAN HELD HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND
AND WAS RESTLESS SILENT AND UNEASY
AT LAST SOMEBODY SAID WITH A
DOOMFUL SIGH
'WELL YONDER'S HAT ISLAND AND WE CAN'T MAKE IT ALL THE WATCHES
CLOSED WITH A SNAP EVERYBODY SIGHED AND MUTTERED SOMETHING ABOUT ITS
BEING 'TOO BAD TOO BAD AH IF WE COULD ONLY HAVE GOT HERE HALF AN HOUR
SOONER AND THE PLACE WAS THICK WITH THE ATMOSPHERE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
SOME STARTED TO GO OUT BUT LOITERED HEARING NO BELL TAP TO LAND
THE
SUN DIPPED BEHIND THE HORIZON THE BOAT WENT ON
INQUIRING LOOKS PASSED
FROM ONE GUEST TO ANOTHER AND ONE WHO HAD HIS HAND ON THE DOOR KNOB
AND HAD TURNED IT WAITED THEN PRESENTLY TOOK AWAY HIS HAND AND LET THE
KNOB TURN BACK AGAIN
WE BORE STEADILY DOWN THE BEND
MORE LOOKS WERE
EXCHANGED AND NODS OF SURPRISED ADMIRATION BUT NO WORDS
INSENSIBLY
THE MEN DREW TOGETHER BEHIND MR
BIXBY AS THE SKY DARKENED AND ONE OR
TWO DIM STARS CAME OUT
THE DEAD SILENCE AND SENSE OF WAITING BECAME
OPPRESSIVE
MR
BIXBY PULLED THE CORD AND TWO DEEP MELLOW NOTES FROM
THE BIG BELL FLOATED OFF ON THE NIGHT
THEN A PAUSE AND ONE MORE NOTE
WAS STRUCK
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE FOLLOWED FROM THE HURRICANE DECK
'LABBOARD LEAD THERE STABBOARD LEAD
THE CRIES OF THE LEADSMEN BEGAN TO RISE OUT OF THE DISTANCE AND WERE
GRUFFLY REPEATED BY THE WORD PASSERS ON THE HURRICANE DECK
'M A R K THREE
M A R K THREE
QUARTER LESS THREE
HALF
TWAIN
QUARTER TWAIN
M A R K TWAIN
QUARTER LESS
MR
BIXBY PULLED TWO BELL ROPES AND WAS ANSWERED BY FAINT JINGLINGS FAR
BELOW IN THE ENGINE ROOM AND OUR SPEED SLACKENED
THE STEAM BEGAN TO
WHISTLE THROUGH THE GAUGE COCKS
THE CRIES OF THE LEADSMEN WENT ON AND
IT IS A WEIRD SOUND ALWAYS IN THE NIGHT
EVERY PILOT IN THE LOT WAS
WATCHING NOW WITH FIXED EYES AND TALKING UNDER HIS BREATH
NOBODY WAS
CALM AND EASY BUT MR
BIXBY
HE WOULD PUT HIS WHEEL DOWN AND STAND ON
A SPOKE AND AS THE STEAMER SWUNG INTO HER TO ME UTTERLY INVISIBLE
MARKS FOR WE SEEMED TO BE IN THE MIDST OF A WIDE AND GLOOMY SEA HE
WOULD MEET AND FASTEN HER THERE
OUT OF THE MURMUR OF HALF AUDIBLE TALK
ONE CAUGHT A COHERENT SENTENCE NOW AND THEN SUCH AS
'THERE SHE'S OVER THE FIRST REEF ALL RIGHT
AFTER A PAUSE ANOTHER SUBDUED VOICE
'HER STERN'S COMING DOWN JUST EXACTLY RIGHT BY GEORGE
'NOW SHE'S IN THE MARKS OVER SHE GOES
SOMEBODY ELSE MUTTERED
'OH IT WAS DONE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL
NOW THE ENGINES WERE STOPPED ALTOGETHER AND WE DRIFTED WITH THE
CURRENT
NOT THAT I COULD SEE THE BOAT DRIFT FOR I COULD NOT THE STARS
BEING ALL GONE BY THIS TIME
THIS DRIFTING WAS THE DISMALEST WORK IT
HELD ONE'S HEART STILL
PRESENTLY I DISCOVERED A BLACKER GLOOM THAN
THAT WHICH SURROUNDED US
IT WAS THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
WE WERE CLOSING
RIGHT DOWN UPON IT
WE ENTERED ITS DEEPER SHADOW AND SO IMMINENT
SEEMED THE PERIL THAT I WAS LIKELY TO SUFFOCATE AND I HAD THE STRONGEST
IMPULSE TO DO SOMETHING ANYTHING TO SAVE THE VESSEL
BUT STILL MR
BIXBY STOOD BY HIS WHEEL SILENT INTENT AS A CAT AND ALL THE PILOTS
STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AT HIS BACK
'SHE'LL NOT MAKE IT SOMEBODY WHISPERED
THE WATER GREW SHOALER AND SHOALER BY THE LEADSMAN'S CRIES TILL IT WAS
DOWN TO
'EIGHT AND A HALF
E I G H T FEET
E I G H T FEET
SEVEN AND
MR
BIXBY SAID WARNINGLY THROUGH HIS SPEAKING TUBE TO THE ENGINEER
'STAND BY NOW
'AYE AYE SIR
'SEVEN AND A HALF SEVEN FEET SIX AND
WE TOUCHED BOTTOM INSTANTLY MR
BIXBY SET A LOT OF BELLS RINGING
SHOUTED THROUGH THE TUBE 'NOW LET HER HAVE IT EVERY OUNCE YOU'VE
GOT THEN TO HIS PARTNER 'PUT HER HARD DOWN SNATCH HER SNATCH HER
THE BOAT RASPED AND GROUND HER WAY THROUGH THE SAND HUNG UPON THE APEX
OF DISASTER A SINGLE TREMENDOUS INSTANT AND THEN OVER SHE WENT AND
SUCH A SHOUT AS WENT UP AT MR
BIXBY'S BACK NEVER LOOSENED THE ROOF OF A
PILOT HOUSE BEFORE
THERE WAS NO MORE TROUBLE AFTER THAT
MR
BIXBY WAS A HERO THAT NIGHT
AND IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME TOO BEFORE HIS EXPLOIT CEASED TO BE TALKED
ABOUT BY RIVER MEN
FULLY TO REALIZE THE MARVELOUS PRECISION REQUIRED IN LAYING THE GREAT
STEAMER IN HER MARKS IN THAT MURKY WASTE OF WATER ONE SHOULD KNOW THAT
NOT ONLY MUST SHE PICK HER INTRICATE WAY THROUGH SNAGS AND BLIND
REEFS AND THEN SHAVE THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND SO CLOSELY AS TO BRUSH
THE OVERHANGING FOLIAGE WITH HER STERN BUT AT ONE PLACE SHE MUST PASS
ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S REACH OF A SUNKEN AND INVISIBLE WRECK THAT WOULD
SNATCH THE HULL TIMBERS FROM UNDER HER IF SHE SHOULD STRIKE IT AND
DESTROY A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS' WORTH OF STEAM BOAT AND CARGO
IN FIVE MINUTES AND MAYBE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY HUMAN LIVES INTO THE
BARGAIN
THE LAST REMARK I HEARD THAT NIGHT WAS A COMPLIMENT TO MR
BIXBY
UTTERED IN SOLILOQUY AND WITH UNCTION BY ONE OF OUR GUESTS
HE SAID
'BY THE SHADOW OF DEATH BUT HE'S A LIGHTNING PILOT
CHAPTER 8
PERPLEXING LESSONS
AT THE END OF WHAT SEEMED A TEDIOUS WHILE I HAD MANAGED TO PACK MY
HEAD FULL OF ISLANDS TOWNS BARS 'POINTS AND BENDS AND A CURIOUSLY
INANIMATE MASS OF LUMBER IT WAS TOO
HOWEVER INASMUCH AS I COULD SHUT
MY EYES AND REEL OFF A GOOD LONG STRING OF THESE NAMES WITHOUT LEAVING
OUT MORE THAN TEN MILES OF RIVER IN EVERY FIFTY I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT
I COULD TAKE A BOAT DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS IF I COULD MAKE HER SKIP THOSE
LITTLE GAPS
BUT OF COURSE MY COMPLACENCY COULD HARDLY GET START ENOUGH
TO LIFT MY NOSE A TRIFLE INTO THE AIR BEFORE MR
BIXBY WOULD THINK OF
SOMETHING TO FETCH IT DOWN AGAIN
ONE DAY HE TURNED ON ME SUDDENLY WITH
THIS SETTLER
'WHAT IS THE SHAPE OF WALNUT BEND
HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE ASKED ME MY GRANDMOTHER'S OPINION OF PROTOPLASM
I REFLECTED RESPECTFULLY AND THEN SAID I DIDN'T KNOW IT HAD ANY
PARTICULAR SHAPE
MY GUNPOWDERY CHIEF WENT OFF WITH A BANG OF COURSE
AND THEN WENT ON LOADING AND FIRING UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF ADJECTIVES
I HAD LEARNED LONG AGO THAT HE ONLY CARRIED JUST SO MANY ROUNDS OF
AMMUNITION AND WAS SURE TO SUBSIDE INTO A VERY PLACABLE AND EVEN
REMORSEFUL OLD SMOOTH BORE AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALL GONE
THAT WORD
'OLD' IS MERELY AFFECTIONATE HE WAS NOT MORE THAN THIRTY FOUR
I
WAITED
BY AND BY HE SAID
'MY BOY YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER PERFECTLY
IT IS
ALL THERE IS LEFT TO STEER BY ON A VERY DARK NIGHT
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS BLOTTED OUT AND GONE
BUT MIND YOU IT HASN'T THE SAME SHAPE IN THE
NIGHT THAT IT HAS IN THE DAY TIME
'HOW ON EARTH AM I EVER GOING TO LEARN IT THEN
'HOW DO YOU FOLLOW A HALL AT HOME IN THE DARK
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE
SHAPE OF IT
YOU CAN'T SEE IT
'DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT I'VE GOT TO KNOW ALL THE MILLION TRIFLING
VARIATIONS OF SHAPE IN THE BANKS OF THIS INTERMINABLE RIVER AS WELL AS I
KNOW THE SHAPE OF THE FRONT HALL AT HOME
'ON MY HONOR YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW THEM BETTER THAN ANY MAN EVER DID
KNOW THE SHAPES OF THE HALLS IN HIS OWN HOUSE
'I WISH I WAS DEAD
'NOW I DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE YOU BUT
'WELL PILE IT ON ME I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT NOW AS ANOTHER TIME
'YOU SEE THIS HAS GOT TO BE LEARNED THERE ISN'T ANY GETTING AROUND
IT
A CLEAR STARLIGHT NIGHT THROWS SUCH HEAVY SHADOWS THAT IF YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THE SHAPE OF A SHORE PERFECTLY YOU WOULD CLAW AWAY FROM EVERY BUNCH
OF TIMBER BECAUSE YOU WOULD TAKE THE BLACK SHADOW OF IT FOR A SOLID
CAPE AND YOU SEE YOU WOULD BE GETTING SCARED TO DEATH EVERY FIFTEEN
MINUTES BY THE WATCH
YOU WOULD BE FIFTY YARDS FROM SHORE ALL THE TIME
WHEN YOU OUGHT TO BE WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF IT
YOU CAN'T SEE A SNAG IN
ONE OF THOSE SHADOWS BUT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS AND THE SHAPE
OF THE RIVER TELLS YOU WHEN YOU ARE COMING TO IT
THEN THERE'S YOUR
PITCH DARK NIGHT THE RIVER IS A VERY DIFFERENT SHAPE ON A PITCH DARK
NIGHT FROM WHAT IT IS ON A STARLIGHT NIGHT
ALL SHORES SEEM TO BE
STRAIGHT LINES THEN AND MIGHTY DIM ONES TOO AND YOU'D RUN THEM FOR
STRAIGHT LINES ONLY YOU KNOW BETTER
YOU BOLDLY DRIVE YOUR BOAT RIGHT
INTO WHAT SEEMS TO BE A SOLID STRAIGHT WALL YOU KNOWING VERY WELL THAT
IN REALITY THERE IS A CURVE THERE AND THAT WALL FALLS BACK AND MAKES
WAY FOR YOU
THEN THERE'S YOUR GRAY MIST
YOU TAKE A NIGHT WHEN THERE'S
ONE OF THESE GRISLY DRIZZLY GRAY MISTS AND THEN THERE ISN'T ANY
PARTICULAR SHAPE TO A SHORE
A GRAY MIST WOULD TANGLE THE HEAD OF THE
OLDEST MAN THAT EVER LIVED
WELL THEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF MOONLIGHT
CHANGE THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER IN DIFFERENT WAYS
YOU SEE
'OH DON'T SAY ANY MORE PLEASE HAVE I GOT TO LEARN THE SHAPE OF THE
RIVER ACCORDING TO ALL THESE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DIFFERENT WAYS IF
I TRIED TO CARRY ALL THAT CARGO IN MY HEAD IT WOULD MAKE ME
STOOP SHOULDERED
NO YOU ONLY LEARN THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER AND YOU LEARN IT WITH
SUCH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS STEER BY THE SHAPE THAT'S
IN YOUR HEAD AND NEVER MIND THE ONE THAT'S BEFORE YOUR EYES
'VERY WELL I'LL TRY IT BUT AFTER I HAVE LEARNED IT CAN I DEPEND ON IT
WILL IT KEEP THE SAME FORM AND NOT GO FOOLING AROUND
BEFORE MR
BIXBY COULD ANSWER MR
W CAME IN TO TAKE THE WATCH AND
HE SAID
'BIXBY YOU'LL HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR PRESIDENT'S ISLAND AND ALL THAT
COUNTRY CLEAR AWAY UP ABOVE THE OLD HEN AND CHICKENS
THE BANKS ARE
CAVING AND THE SHAPE OF THE SHORES CHANGING LIKE EVERYTHING
WHY
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THE POINT ABOVE 40
YOU CAN GO UP INSIDE THE OLD
SYCAMORE SNAG NOW FOOTNOTE 1
IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY BUT STILL IT
CAN DO NO HARM TO EXPLAIN THAT 'INSIDE' MEANS BETWEEN THE SNAG AND THE
SHORE M T
SO THAT QUESTION WAS ANSWERED
HERE WERE LEAGUES OF SHORE CHANGING
SHAPE
MY SPIRITS WERE DOWN IN THE MUD AGAIN
TWO THINGS SEEMED PRETTY
APPARENT TO ME
ONE WAS THAT IN ORDER TO BE A PILOT A MAN HAD GOT TO
LEARN MORE THAN ANY ONE MAN OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO KNOW AND THE OTHER
WAS THAT HE MUST LEARN IT ALL OVER AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY EVERY
TWENTY FOUR HOURS
THAT NIGHT WE HAD THE WATCH UNTIL TWELVE
NOW IT WAS AN ANCIENT RIVER
CUSTOM FOR THE TWO PILOTS TO CHAT A BIT WHEN THE WATCH CHANGED
WHILE
THE RELIEVING PILOT PUT ON HIS GLOVES AND LIT HIS CIGAR HIS PARTNER
THE RETIRING PILOT WOULD SAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS
'I JUDGE THE UPPER BAR IS MAKING DOWN A LITTLE AT HALE'S POINT HAD
QUARTER TWAIN WITH THE LOWER LEAD AND MARK TWAIN FOOTNOTE TWO FATHOMS
'QUARTER TWAIN' IS TWO AND A QUARTER FATHOMS THIRTEEN AND A HALF FEET
'MARK THREE' IS THREE FATHOMS WITH THE OTHER
'YES I THOUGHT IT WAS MAKING DOWN A LITTLE LAST TRIP
MEET ANY BOATS
'MET ONE ABREAST THE HEAD OF 21 BUT SHE WAS AWAY OVER HUGGING THE
BAR AND I COULDN'T MAKE HER OUT ENTIRELY
I TOOK HER FOR THE SUNNY
SOUTH HADN'T ANY SKYLIGHTS FORWARD OF THE CHIMNEYS
AND SO ON
AND AS THE RELIEVING PILOT TOOK THE WHEEL HIS PARTNER
FOOTNOTE 'PARTNER' IS A TECHNICAL TERM FOR 'THE OTHER PILOT' WOULD
MENTION THAT WE WERE IN SUCH AND SUCH A BEND AND SAY WE WERE ABREAST
OF SUCH AND SUCH A MAN'S WOOD YARD OR PLANTATION
THIS WAS COURTESY
I SUPPOSED IT WAS NECESSITY
BUT MR
W CAME ON WATCH FULL TWELVE
MINUTES LATE ON THIS PARTICULAR NIGHT A TREMENDOUS BREACH OF
ETIQUETTE IN FACT IT IS THE UNPARDONABLE SIN AMONG PILOTS
SO MR
BIXBY GAVE HIM NO GREETING WHATEVER BUT SIMPLY SURRENDERED THE WHEEL
AND MARCHED OUT OF THE PILOT HOUSE WITHOUT A WORD
I WAS APPALLED IT
WAS A VILLAINOUS NIGHT FOR BLACKNESS WE WERE IN A PARTICULARLY WIDE
AND BLIND PART OF THE RIVER WHERE THERE WAS NO SHAPE OR SUBSTANCE TO
ANYTHING AND IT SEEMED INCREDIBLE THAT MR
BIXBY SHOULD HAVE LEFT THAT
POOR FELLOW TO KILL THE BOAT TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE HE WAS
BUT I
RESOLVED THAT I WOULD STAND BY HIM ANY WAY
HE SHOULD FIND THAT HE WAS
NOT WHOLLY FRIENDLESS
SO I STOOD AROUND AND WAITED TO BE ASKED WHERE
WE WERE
BUT MR
W PLUNGED ON SERENELY THROUGH THE SOLID FIRMAMENT
OF BLACK CATS THAT STOOD FOR AN ATMOSPHERE AND NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH
HERE IS A PROUD DEVIL THOUGHT I HERE IS A LIMB OF SATAN THAT WOULD
RATHER SEND US ALL TO DESTRUCTION THAN PUT HIMSELF UNDER OBLIGATIONS TO
ME BECAUSE I AM NOT YET ONE OF THE SALT OF THE EARTH AND PRIVILEGED TO
SNUB CAPTAINS AND LORD IT OVER EVERYTHING DEAD AND ALIVE IN A STEAMBOAT
I PRESENTLY CLIMBED UP ON THE BENCH I DID NOT THINK IT WAS SAFE TO GO
TO SLEEP WHILE THIS LUNATIC WAS ON WATCH
HOWEVER I MUST HAVE GONE TO SLEEP IN THE COURSE OF TIME BECAUSE THE
NEXT THING I WAS AWARE OF WAS THE FACT THAT DAY WAS BREAKING MR
W
GONE AND MR
BIXBY AT THE WHEEL AGAIN
SO IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK AND ALL
WELL BUT ME I FELT LIKE A SKINFUL OF DRY BONES AND ALL OF THEM TRYING
TO ACHE AT ONCE
MR
BIXBY ASKED ME WHAT I HAD STAYED UP THERE FOR
I CONFESSED THAT IT
WAS TO DO MR
W A BENEVOLENCE TELL HIM WHERE HE WAS
IT TOOK FIVE
MINUTES FOR THE ENTIRE PREPOSTEROUSNESS OF THE THING TO FILTER INTO MR
BIXBY'S SYSTEM AND THEN I JUDGE IT FILLED HIM NEARLY UP TO THE CHIN
BECAUSE HE PAID ME A COMPLIMENT AND NOT MUCH OF A ONE EITHER
HE SAID
'WELL TAKING YOU BY AND LARGE YOU DO SEEM TO BE MORE DIFFERENT KINDS
OF AN ASS THAN ANY CREATURE I EVER SAW BEFORE
WHAT DID YOU SUPPOSE HE
WANTED TO KNOW FOR
I SAID I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A CONVENIENCE TO HIM
'CONVENIENCE D NATION DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT A MAN'S GOT TO KNOW THE
RIVER IN THE NIGHT THE SAME AS HE'D KNOW HIS OWN FRONT HALL
'WELL I CAN FOLLOW THE FRONT HALL IN THE DARK IF I KNOW IT IS THE
FRONT HALL BUT SUPPOSE YOU SET ME DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT IN THE DARK
AND NOT TELL ME WHICH HALL IT IS HOW AM I TO KNOW
'WELL YOU'VE GOT TO ON THE RIVER
'ALL RIGHT
THEN I'M GLAD I NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO MR
W
'I SHOULD SAY SO
WHY HE'D HAVE SLAMMED YOU THROUGH THE WINDOW AND
UTTERLY RUINED A HUNDRED DOLLARS' WORTH OF WINDOW SASH AND STUFF
I WAS GLAD THIS DAMAGE HAD BEEN SAVED FOR IT WOULD HAVE MADE ME
UNPOPULAR WITH THE OWNERS
THEY ALWAYS HATED ANYBODY WHO HAD THE NAME OF
BEING CARELESS AND INJURING THINGS
I WENT TO WORK NOW TO LEARN THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER AND OF ALL THE
ELUDING AND UNGRASPABLE OBJECTS THAT EVER I TRIED TO GET MIND OR HANDS
ON THAT WAS THE CHIEF
I WOULD FASTEN MY EYES UPON A SHARP WOODED
POINT THAT PROJECTED FAR INTO THE RIVER SOME MILES AHEAD OF ME AND GO
TO LABORIOUSLY PHOTOGRAPHING ITS SHAPE UPON MY BRAIN AND JUST AS I WAS
BEGINNING TO SUCCEED TO MY SATISFACTION WE WOULD DRAW UP TOWARD IT AND
THE EXASPERATING THING WOULD BEGIN TO MELT AWAY AND FOLD BACK INTO THE
BANK IF THERE HAD BEEN A CONSPICUOUS DEAD TREE STANDING UPON THE VERY
POINT OF THE CAPE I WOULD FIND THAT TREE INCONSPICUOUSLY MERGED INTO
THE GENERAL FOREST AND OCCUPYING THE MIDDLE OF A STRAIGHT SHORE WHEN
I GOT ABREAST OF IT NO PROMINENT HILL WOULD STICK TO ITS SHAPE LONG
ENOUGH FOR ME TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHAT ITS FORM REALLY WAS BUT IT WAS AS
DISSOLVING AND CHANGEFUL AS IF IT HAD BEEN A MOUNTAIN OF BUTTER IN THE
HOTTEST CORNER OF THE TROPICS
NOTHING EVER HAD THE SAME SHAPE WHEN
I WAS COMING DOWNSTREAM THAT IT HAD BORNE WHEN I WENT UP
I MENTIONED
THESE LITTLE DIFFICULTIES TO MR
BIXBY
HE SAID
'THAT'S THE VERY MAIN VIRTUE OF THE THING
IF THE SHAPES DIDN'T CHANGE
EVERY THREE SECONDS THEY WOULDN'T BE OF ANY USE
TAKE THIS PLACE WHERE
WE ARE NOW FOR INSTANCE
AS LONG AS THAT HILL OVER YONDER IS ONLY ONE
HILL I CAN BOOM RIGHT ALONG THE WAY I'M GOING BUT THE MOMENT IT SPLITS
AT THE TOP AND FORMS A V I KNOW I'VE GOT TO SCRATCH TO STARBOARD IN A
HURRY OR I'LL BANG THIS BOAT'S BRAINS OUT AGAINST A ROCK AND THEN THE
MOMENT ONE OF THE PRONGS OF THE V SWINGS BEHIND THE OTHER I'VE GOT TO
WALTZ TO LARBOARD AGAIN OR I'LL HAVE A MISUNDERSTANDING WITH A SNAG
THAT WOULD SNATCH THE KEELSON OUT OF THIS STEAMBOAT AS NEATLY AS IF IT
WERE A SLIVER IN YOUR HAND
IF THAT HILL DIDN'T CHANGE ITS SHAPE ON BAD
NIGHTS THERE WOULD BE AN AWFUL STEAMBOAT GRAVE YARD AROUND HERE INSIDE
OF A YEAR
IT WAS PLAIN THAT I HAD GOT TO LEARN THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER IN ALL THE
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT COULD BE THOUGHT OF UPSIDE DOWN WRONG END FIRST
INSIDE OUT FORE AND AFT AND 'THORTSHIPS AND THEN KNOW WHAT TO DO ON
GRAY NIGHTS WHEN IT HADN'T ANY SHAPE AT ALL
SO I SET ABOUT IT
IN THE
COURSE OF TIME I BEGAN TO GET THE BEST OF THIS KNOTTY LESSON AND MY
SELF COMPLACENCY MOVED TO THE FRONT ONCE MORE
MR
BIXBY WAS ALL FIXED
AND READY TO START IT TO THE REAR AGAIN
HE OPENED ON ME AFTER THIS
FASHION
'HOW MUCH WATER DID WE HAVE IN THE MIDDLE CROSSING AT HOLE IN THE WALL
TRIP BEFORE LAST
I CONSIDERED THIS AN OUTRAGE
I SAID
'EVERY TRIP DOWN AND UP THE LEADSMEN ARE SINGING THROUGH THAT TANGLED
PLACE FOR THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR ON A STRETCH
HOW DO YOU RECKON I
CAN REMEMBER SUCH A MESS AS THAT
'MY BOY YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IT
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THE EXACT
SPOT AND THE EXACT MARKS THE BOAT LAY IN WHEN WE HAD THE SHOALEST WATER
IN EVERYONE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED SHOAL PLACES BETWEEN ST
LOUIS AND NEW
ORLEANS AND YOU MUSTN'T GET THE SHOAL SOUNDINGS AND MARKS OF ONE TRIP
MIXED UP WITH THE SHOAL SOUNDINGS AND MARKS OF ANOTHER EITHER FOR
THEY'RE NOT OFTEN TWICE ALIKE
YOU MUST KEEP THEM SEPARATE
WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AGAIN I SAID
'WHEN I GET SO THAT I CAN DO THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO RAISE THE DEAD
AND THEN I WON'T HAVE TO PILOT A STEAMBOAT TO MAKE A LIVING
I WANT TO
RETIRE FROM THIS BUSINESS
I WANT A SLUSH BUCKET AND A BRUSH I'M ONLY
FIT FOR A ROUSTABOUT
I HAVEN'T GOT BRAINS ENOUGH TO BE A PILOT AND
IF I HAD I WOULDN'T HAVE STRENGTH ENOUGH TO CARRY THEM AROUND UNLESS I
WENT ON CRUTCHES
'NOW DROP THAT WHEN I SAY I'LL LEARN FOOTNOTE 'TEACH' IS NOT IN THE
RIVER VOCABULARY A MAN THE RIVER I MEAN IT
AND YOU CAN DEPEND ON
IT I'LL LEARN HIM OR KILL HIM
CHAPTER 9
CONTINUED PERPLEXITIES
THERE WAS NO USE IN ARGUING WITH A PERSON LIKE THIS
I PROMPTLY PUT
SUCH A STRAIN ON MY MEMORY THAT BY AND BY EVEN THE SHOAL WATER AND THE
COUNTLESS CROSSING MARKS BEGAN TO STAY WITH ME
BUT THE RESULT WAS JUST
THE SAME
I NEVER COULD MORE THAN GET ONE KNOTTY THING LEARNED BEFORE
ANOTHER PRESENTED ITSELF
NOW I HAD OFTEN SEEN PILOTS GAZING AT THE
WATER AND PRETENDING TO READ IT AS IF IT WERE A BOOK BUT IT WAS A
BOOK THAT TOLD ME NOTHING
A TIME CAME AT LAST HOWEVER WHEN MR
BIXBY SEEMED TO THINK ME FAR ENOUGH ADVANCED TO BEAR A LESSON ON
WATER READING
SO HE BEGAN
'DO YOU SEE THAT LONG SLANTING LINE ON THE FACE OF THE WATER NOW
THAT'S A REEF
MOREOVER IT'S A BLUFF REEF
THERE IS A SOLID SAND BAR
UNDER IT THAT IS NEARLY AS STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN AS THE SIDE OF A HOUSE
THERE IS PLENTY OF WATER CLOSE UP TO IT BUT MIGHTY LITTLE ON TOP OF IT
IF YOU WERE TO HIT IT YOU WOULD KNOCK THE BOAT'S BRAINS OUT
DO YOU SEE
WHERE THE LINE FRINGES OUT AT THE UPPER END AND BEGINS TO FADE AWAY
'YES SIR
'WELL THAT IS A LOW PLACE THAT IS THE HEAD OF THE REEF
YOU CAN CLIMB
OVER THERE AND NOT HURT ANYTHING
CROSS OVER NOW AND FOLLOW ALONG
CLOSE UNDER THE REEF EASY WATER THERE NOT MUCH CURRENT
I FOLLOWED THE REEF ALONG TILL I APPROACHED THE FRINGED END
THEN MR
BIXBY SAID
'NOW GET READY
WAIT TILL I GIVE THE WORD
SHE WON'T WANT TO MOUNT THE
REEF A BOAT HATES SHOAL WATER
STAND BY WAIT WAIT KEEP HER WELL IN
HAND
NOW CRAMP HER DOWN SNATCH HER SNATCH HER
HE SEIZED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WHEEL AND HELPED TO SPIN IT AROUND UNTIL
IT WAS HARD DOWN AND THEN WE HELD IT SO
THE BOAT RESISTED AND REFUSED
TO ANSWER FOR A WHILE AND NEXT SHE CAME SURGING TO STARBOARD MOUNTED
THE REEF AND SENT A LONG ANGRY RIDGE OF WATER FOAMING AWAY FROM HER
BOWS
'NOW WATCH HER WATCH HER LIKE A CAT OR SHE'LL GET AWAY FROM YOU
WHEN
SHE FIGHTS STRONG AND THE TILLER SLIPS A LITTLE IN A JERKY GREASY SORT
OF WAY LET UP ON HER A TRIFLE IT IS THE WAY SHE TELLS YOU AT NIGHT
THAT THE WATER IS TOO SHOAL BUT KEEP EDGING HER UP LITTLE BY LITTLE
TOWARD THE POINT
YOU ARE WELL UP ON THE BAR NOW THERE IS A BAR UNDER
EVERY POINT BECAUSE THE WATER THAT COMES DOWN AROUND IT FORMS AN EDDY
AND ALLOWS THE SEDIMENT TO SINK
DO YOU SEE THOSE FINE LINES ON THE FACE
OF THE WATER THAT BRANCH OUT LIKE THE RIBS OF A FAN
WELL THOSE ARE
LITTLE REEFS YOU WANT TO JUST MISS THE ENDS OF THEM BUT RUN THEM
PRETTY CLOSE
NOW LOOK OUT LOOK OUT DON'T YOU CROWD THAT SLICK
GREASY LOOKING PLACE THERE AIN'T NINE FEET THERE SHE WON'T STAND IT
SHE BEGINS TO SMELL IT LOOK SHARP I TELL YOU OH BLAZES THERE YOU GO
STOP THE STARBOARD WHEEL QUICK SHIP UP TO BACK SET HER BACK
THE ENGINE BELLS JINGLED AND THE ENGINES ANSWERED PROMPTLY SHOOTING
WHITE COLUMNS OF STEAM FAR ALOFT OUT OF THE 'SCAPE PIPES BUT IT WAS
TOO LATE
THE BOAT HAD 'SMELT' THE BAR IN GOOD EARNEST THE FOAMY RIDGES
THAT RADIATED FROM HER BOWS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED A GREAT DEAD SWELL
CAME ROLLING FORWARD AND SWEPT AHEAD OF HER SHE CAREENED FAR OVER TO
LARBOARD AND WENT TEARING AWAY TOWARD THE OTHER SHORE AS IF SHE WERE
ABOUT SCARED TO DEATH
WE WERE A GOOD MILE FROM WHERE WE OUGHT TO HAVE
BEEN WHEN WE FINALLY GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HER AGAIN
DURING THE AFTERNOON WATCH THE NEXT DAY MR
BIXBY ASKED ME IF I KNEW
HOW TO RUN THE NEXT FEW MILES
I SAID
'GO INSIDE THE FIRST SNAG ABOVE THE POINT OUTSIDE THE NEXT ONE START
OUT FROM THE LOWER END OF HIGGINS'S WOOD YARD MAKE A SQUARE CROSSING
AND
'THAT'S ALL RIGHT
I'LL BE BACK BEFORE YOU CLOSE UP ON THE NEXT POINT
BUT HE WASN'T
HE WAS STILL BELOW WHEN I ROUNDED IT AND ENTERED UPON A
PIECE OF RIVER WHICH I HAD SOME MISGIVINGS ABOUT
I DID NOT KNOW THAT
HE WAS HIDING BEHIND A CHIMNEY TO SEE HOW I WOULD PERFORM
I WENT GAILY
ALONG GETTING PROUDER AND PROUDER FOR HE HAD NEVER LEFT THE BOAT IN
MY SOLE CHARGE SUCH A LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE
I EVEN GOT TO 'SETTING'
HER AND LETTING THE WHEEL GO ENTIRELY WHILE I VAINGLORIOUSLY TURNED
MY BACK AND INSPECTED THE STEM MARKS AND HUMMED A TUNE A SORT OF EASY
INDIFFERENCE WHICH I HAD PRODIGIOUSLY ADMIRED IN BIXBY AND OTHER GREAT
PILOTS
ONCE I INSPECTED RATHER LONG AND WHEN I FACED TO THE FRONT
AGAIN MY HEART FLEW INTO MY MOUTH SO SUDDENLY THAT IF I HADN'T CLAPPED
MY TEETH TOGETHER I SHOULD HAVE LOST IT
ONE OF THOSE FRIGHTFUL BLUFF
REEFS WAS STRETCHING ITS DEADLY LENGTH RIGHT ACROSS OUR BOWS MY HEAD
WAS GONE IN A MOMENT I DID NOT KNOW WHICH END I STOOD ON I GASPED AND
COULD NOT GET MY BREATH I SPUN THE WHEEL DOWN WITH SUCH RAPIDITY THAT
IT WOVE ITSELF TOGETHER LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB THE BOAT ANSWERED AND
TURNED SQUARE AWAY FROM THE REEF BUT THE REEF FOLLOWED HER I FLED AND
STILL IT FOLLOWED STILL IT KEPT RIGHT ACROSS MY BOWS I NEVER LOOKED
TO SEE WHERE I WAS GOING I ONLY FLED
THE AWFUL CRASH WAS IMMINENT WHY
DIDN'T THAT VILLAIN COME IF I COMMITTED THE CRIME OF RINGING A BELL
I MIGHT GET THROWN OVERBOARD
BUT BETTER THAT THAN KILL THE BOAT
SO
IN BLIND DESPERATION I STARTED SUCH A RATTLING 'SHIVAREE' DOWN BELOW AS
NEVER HAD ASTOUNDED AN ENGINEER IN THIS WORLD BEFORE I FANCY
AMIDST
THE FRENZY OF THE BELLS THE ENGINES BEGAN TO BACK AND FILL IN A FURIOUS
WAY AND MY REASON FORSOOK ITS THRONE WE WERE ABOUT TO CRASH INTO THE
WOODS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER
JUST THEN MR
BIXBY STEPPED CALMLY
INTO VIEW ON THE HURRICANE DECK
MY SOUL WENT OUT TO HIM IN GRATITUDE
MY DISTRESS VANISHED I WOULD HAVE FELT SAFE ON THE BRINK OF NIAGARA
WITH MR
BIXBY ON THE HURRICANE DECK
HE BLANDLY AND SWEETLY TOOK
HIS TOOTH PICK OUT OF HIS MOUTH BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AS IF IT WERE A
CIGAR WE WERE JUST IN THE ACT OF CLIMBING AN OVERHANGING BIG TREE
AND THE PASSENGERS WERE SCUDDING ASTERN LIKE RATS AND LIFTED UP THESE
COMMANDS TO ME EVER SO GENTLY
'STOP THE STARBOARD
STOP THE LARBOARD
SET HER BACK ON BOTH
THE BOAT HESITATED HALTED PRESSED HER NOSE AMONG THE BOUGHS A CRITICAL
INSTANT THEN RELUCTANTLY BEGAN TO BACK AWAY
'STOP THE LARBOARD
COME AHEAD ON IT
STOP THE STARBOARD
COME AHEAD ON
IT
POINT HER FOR THE BAR
I SAILED AWAY AS SERENELY AS A SUMMER'S MORNING
MR
BIXBY CAME IN AND
SAID WITH MOCK SIMPLICITY
'WHEN YOU HAVE A HAIL MY BOY YOU OUGHT TO TAP THE BIG BELL THREE TIMES
BEFORE YOU LAND SO THAT THE ENGINEERS CAN GET READY
I BLUSHED UNDER THE SARCASM AND SAID I HADN'T HAD ANY HAIL
'AH THEN IT WAS FOR WOOD I SUPPOSE
THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH WILL TELL
YOU WHEN HE WANTS TO WOOD UP
I WENT ON CONSUMING AND SAID I WASN'T AFTER WOOD
'INDEED WHY WHAT COULD YOU WANT OVER HERE IN THE BEND THEN DID YOU
EVER KNOW OF A BOAT FOLLOWING A BEND UP STREAM AT THIS STAGE OF THE
RIVER
'NO SIR AND I WASN'T TRYING TO FOLLOW IT
I WAS GETTING AWAY FROM A
BLUFF REEF
'NO IT WASN'T A BLUFF REEF THERE ISN'T ONE WITHIN THREE MILES OF WHERE
YOU WERE
'BUT I SAW IT
IT WAS AS BLUFF AS THAT ONE YONDER
'JUST ABOUT
RUN OVER IT
'DO YOU GIVE IT AS AN ORDER
'YES
RUN OVER IT
'IF I DON'T I WISH I MAY DIE
'ALL RIGHT I AM TAKING THE RESPONSIBILITY I WAS JUST AS ANXIOUS TO
KILL THE BOAT NOW AS I HAD BEEN TO SAVE HER BEFORE
I IMPRESSED MY
ORDERS UPON MY MEMORY TO BE USED AT THE INQUEST AND MADE A STRAIGHT
BREAK FOR THE REEF
AS IT DISAPPEARED UNDER OUR BOWS I HELD MY BREATH
BUT WE SLID OVER IT LIKE OIL
'NOW DON'T YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE IT WASN'T ANYTHING BUT A WIND REEF
THE WIND DOES THAT
'SO I SEE
BUT IT IS EXACTLY LIKE A BLUFF REEF
HOW AM I EVER GOING TO
TELL THEM APART
'I CAN'T TELL YOU
IT IS AN INSTINCT
BY AND BY YOU WILL JUST NATURALLY
KNOW ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT YOU NEVER WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY OR
HOW YOU KNOW THEM APART'
IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE
THE FACE OF THE WATER IN TIME BECAME A
WONDERFUL BOOK A BOOK THAT WAS A DEAD LANGUAGE TO THE UNEDUCATED
PASSENGER BUT WHICH TOLD ITS MIND TO ME WITHOUT RESERVE DELIVERING ITS
MOST CHERISHED SECRETS AS CLEARLY AS IF IT UTTERED THEM WITH A VOICE
AND IT WAS NOT A BOOK TO BE READ ONCE AND THROWN ASIDE FOR IT HAD A NEW
STORY TO TELL EVERY DAY
THROUGHOUT THE LONG TWELVE HUNDRED MILES THERE
WAS NEVER A PAGE THAT WAS VOID OF INTEREST NEVER ONE THAT YOU COULD
LEAVE UNREAD WITHOUT LOSS NEVER ONE THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO SKIP
THINKING YOU COULD FIND HIGHER ENJOYMENT IN SOME OTHER THING
THERE
NEVER WAS SO WONDERFUL A BOOK WRITTEN BY MAN NEVER ONE WHOSE INTEREST
WAS SO ABSORBING SO UNFLAGGING SO SPARKINGLY RENEWED WITH EVERY
REPERUSAL
THE PASSENGER WHO COULD NOT READ IT WAS CHARMED WITH A
PECULIAR SORT OF FAINT DIMPLE ON ITS SURFACE ON THE RARE OCCASIONS
WHEN HE DID NOT OVERLOOK IT ALTOGETHER BUT TO THE PILOT THAT WAS AN
ITALICIZED PASSAGE INDEED IT WAS MORE THAN THAT IT WAS A LEGEND OF
THE LARGEST CAPITALS WITH A STRING OF SHOUTING EXCLAMATION POINTS AT
THE END OF IT FOR IT MEANT THAT A WRECK OR A ROCK WAS BURIED THERE THAT
COULD TEAR THE LIFE OUT OF THE STRONGEST VESSEL THAT EVER FLOATED
IT IS
THE FAINTEST AND SIMPLEST EXPRESSION THE WATER EVER MAKES AND THE MOST
HIDEOUS TO A PILOT'S EYE
IN TRUTH THE PASSENGER WHO COULD NOT READ
THIS BOOK SAW NOTHING BUT ALL MANNER OF PRETTY PICTURES IN IT PAINTED BY
THE SUN AND SHADED BY THE CLOUDS WHEREAS TO THE TRAINED EYE THESE
WERE NOT PICTURES AT ALL BUT THE GRIMMEST AND MOST DEAD EARNEST OF
READING MATTER
NOW WHEN I HAD MASTERED THE LANGUAGE OF THIS WATER AND HAD COME TO KNOW
EVERY TRIFLING FEATURE THAT BORDERED THE GREAT RIVER AS FAMILIARLY AS I
KNEW THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET I HAD MADE A VALUABLE ACQUISITION
BUT I HAD LOST SOMETHING TOO
I HAD LOST SOMETHING WHICH COULD NEVER BE
RESTORED TO ME WHILE I LIVED
ALL THE GRACE THE BEAUTY THE POETRY HAD
GONE OUT OF THE MAJESTIC RIVER I STILL KEEP IN MIND A CERTAIN WONDERFUL
SUNSET WHICH I WITNESSED WHEN STEAMBOATING WAS NEW TO ME
A BROAD
EXPANSE OF THE RIVER WAS TURNED TO BLOOD IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE THE RED
HUE BRIGHTENED INTO GOLD THROUGH WHICH A SOLITARY LOG CAME FLOATING
BLACK AND CONSPICUOUS IN ONE PLACE A LONG SLANTING MARK LAY SPARKLING
UPON THE WATER IN ANOTHER THE SURFACE WAS BROKEN BY BOILING TUMBLING
RINGS THAT WERE AS MANY TINTED AS AN OPAL WHERE THE RUDDY FLUSH WAS
FAINTEST WAS A SMOOTH SPOT THAT WAS COVERED WITH GRACEFUL CIRCLES AND
RADIATING LINES EVER SO DELICATELY TRACED THE SHORE ON OUR LEFT WAS
DENSELY WOODED AND THE SOMBER SHADOW THAT FELL FROM THIS FOREST WAS
BROKEN IN ONE PLACE BY A LONG RUFFLED TRAIL THAT SHONE LIKE SILVER
AND HIGH ABOVE THE FOREST WALL A CLEAN STEMMED DEAD TREE WAVED A SINGLE
LEAFY BOUGH THAT GLOWED LIKE A FLAME IN THE UNOBSTRUCTED SPLENDOR THAT
WAS FLOWING FROM THE SUN
THERE WERE GRACEFUL CURVES REFLECTED IMAGES
WOODY HEIGHTS SOFT DISTANCES AND OVER THE WHOLE SCENE FAR AND NEAR
THE DISSOLVING LIGHTS DRIFTED STEADILY ENRICHING IT EVERY PASSING
MOMENT WITH NEW MARVELS OF COLORING
I STOOD LIKE ONE BEWITCHED
I DRANK IT IN IN A SPEECHLESS RAPTURE
THE
WORLD WAS NEW TO ME AND I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS AT HOME
BUT AS I HAVE SAID A DAY CAME WHEN I BEGAN TO CEASE FROM NOTING THE
GLORIES AND THE CHARMS WHICH THE MOON AND THE SUN AND THE TWILIGHT
WROUGHT UPON THE RIVER'S FACE ANOTHER DAY CAME WHEN I CEASED ALTOGETHER
TO NOTE THEM
THEN IF THAT SUNSET SCENE HAD BEEN REPEATED I SHOULD
HAVE LOOKED UPON IT WITHOUT RAPTURE AND SHOULD HAVE COMMENTED UPON IT
INWARDLY AFTER THIS FASHION THIS SUN MEANS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
WIND TO MORROW THAT FLOATING LOG MEANS THAT THE RIVER IS RISING SMALL
THANKS TO IT THAT SLANTING MARK ON THE WATER REFERS TO A BLUFF REEF
WHICH IS GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY'S STEAMBOAT ONE OF THESE NIGHTS IF
IT KEEPS ON STRETCHING OUT LIKE THAT THOSE TUMBLING 'BOILS' SHOW A
DISSOLVING BAR AND A CHANGING CHANNEL THERE THE LINES AND CIRCLES IN
THE SLICK WATER OVER YONDER ARE A WARNING THAT THAT TROUBLESOME PLACE IS
SHOALING UP DANGEROUSLY THAT SILVER STREAK IN THE SHADOW OF THE FOREST
IS THE 'BREAK' FROM A NEW SNAG AND HE HAS LOCATED HIMSELF IN THE VERY
BEST PLACE HE COULD HAVE FOUND TO FISH FOR STEAMBOATS THAT TALL DEAD
TREE WITH A SINGLE LIVING BRANCH IS NOT GOING TO LAST LONG AND
THEN HOW IS A BODY EVER GOING TO GET THROUGH THIS BLIND PLACE AT NIGHT
WITHOUT THE FRIENDLY OLD LANDMARK
NO THE ROMANCE AND THE BEAUTY WERE ALL GONE FROM THE RIVER
ALL THE
VALUE ANY FEATURE OF IT HAD FOR ME NOW WAS THE AMOUNT OF USEFULNESS IT
COULD FURNISH TOWARD COMPASSING THE SAFE PILOTING OF A STEAMBOAT
SINCE
THOSE DAYS I HAVE PITIED DOCTORS FROM MY HEART
WHAT DOES THE LOVELY
FLUSH IN A BEAUTY'S CHEEK MEAN TO A DOCTOR BUT A 'BREAK' THAT RIPPLES
ABOVE SOME DEADLY DISEASE
ARE NOT ALL HER VISIBLE CHARMS SOWN THICK
WITH WHAT ARE TO HIM THE SIGNS AND SYMBOLS OF HIDDEN DECAY DOES HE EVER
SEE HER BEAUTY AT ALL OR DOESN'T HE SIMPLY VIEW HER PROFESSIONALLY AND
COMMENT UPON HER UNWHOLESOME CONDITION ALL TO HIMSELF AND DOESN'T HE
SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER HE HAS GAINED MOST OR LOST MOST BY LEARNING HIS
TRADE
CHAPTER 10
COMPLETING MY EDUCATION
WHOSOEVER HAS DONE ME THE COURTESY TO READ MY CHAPTERS WHICH HAVE
PRECEDED THIS MAY POSSIBLY WONDER THAT I DEAL SO MINUTELY WITH PILOTING
AS A SCIENCE
IT WAS THE PRIME PURPOSE OF THOSE CHAPTERS AND I AM NOT
QUITE DONE YET
I WISH TO SHOW IN THE MOST PATIENT AND PAINSTAKING WAY
WHAT A WONDERFUL SCIENCE IT IS
SHIP CHANNELS ARE BUOYED AND LIGHTED
AND THEREFORE IT IS A COMPARATIVELY EASY UNDERTAKING TO LEARN TO RUN
THEM CLEAR WATER RIVERS WITH GRAVEL BOTTOMS CHANGE THEIR CHANNELS
VERY GRADUALLY AND THEREFORE ONE NEEDS TO LEARN THEM BUT ONCE BUT
PILOTING BECOMES ANOTHER MATTER WHEN YOU APPLY IT TO VAST STREAMS LIKE
THE MISSISSIPPI AND THE MISSOURI WHOSE ALLUVIAL BANKS CAVE AND CHANGE
CONSTANTLY WHOSE SNAGS ARE ALWAYS HUNTING UP NEW QUARTERS WHOSE
SANDBARS ARE NEVER AT REST WHOSE CHANNELS ARE FOR EVER DODGING AND
SHIRKING AND WHOSE OBSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CONFRONTED IN ALL NIGHTS AND
ALL WEATHERS WITHOUT THE AID OF A SINGLE LIGHT HOUSE OR A SINGLE BUOY
FOR THERE IS NEITHER LIGHT NOR BUOY TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN ALL THIS
THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF VILLAINOUS RIVER FOOTNOTE TRUE AT THE
TIME REFERRED TO NOT TRUE NOW 1882 I FEEL JUSTIFIED IN ENLARGING
UPON THIS GREAT SCIENCE FOR THE REASON THAT I FEEL SURE NO ONE HAS EVER
YET WRITTEN A PARAGRAPH ABOUT IT WHO HAD PILOTED A STEAMBOAT HIMSELF
AND SO HAD A PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT
IF THE THEME WERE
HACKNEYED I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO DEAL GENTLY WITH THE READER BUT
SINCE IT IS WHOLLY NEW I HAVE FELT AT LIBERTY TO TAKE UP A CONSIDERABLE
DEGREE OF ROOM WITH IT
WHEN I HAD LEARNED THE NAME AND POSITION OF EVERY VISIBLE FEATURE OF THE
RIVER WHEN I HAD SO MASTERED ITS SHAPE THAT I COULD SHUT MY EYES AND
TRACE IT FROM ST
LOUIS TO NEW ORLEANS WHEN I HAD LEARNED TO READ THE
FACE OF THE WATER AS ONE WOULD CULL THE NEWS FROM THE MORNING PAPER
AND FINALLY WHEN I HAD TRAINED MY DULL MEMORY TO TREASURE UP AN ENDLESS
ARRAY OF SOUNDINGS AND CROSSING MARKS AND KEEP FAST HOLD OF THEM I
JUDGED THAT MY EDUCATION WAS COMPLETE SO I GOT TO TILTING MY CAP TO THE
SIDE OF MY HEAD AND WEARING A TOOTH PICK IN MY MOUTH AT THE WHEEL
MR
BIXBY HAD HIS EYE ON THESE AIRS
ONE DAY HE SAID
'WHAT IS THE HEIGHT OF THAT BANK YONDER AT BURGESS'S
'HOW CAN I TELL SIR
IT IS THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE AWAY
'VERY POOR EYE VERY POOR
TAKE THE GLASS
I TOOK THE GLASS AND PRESENTLY SAID 'I CAN'T TELL
I SUPPOSE THAT THAT
BANK IS ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF HIGH
'FOOT AND A HALF THAT'S A SIX FOOT BANK
HOW HIGH WAS THE BANK ALONG
HERE LAST TRIP
'I DON'T KNOW I NEVER NOTICED
'YOU DIDN'T WELL YOU MUST ALWAYS DO IT HEREAFTER
'WHY
'BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO KNOW A GOOD MANY THINGS THAT IT TELLS YOU
FOR ONE THING IT TELLS YOU THE STAGE OF THE RIVER TELLS YOU WHETHER
THERE'S MORE WATER OR LESS IN THE RIVER ALONG HERE THAN THERE WAS LAST
TRIP
'THE LEADS TELL ME THAT I RATHER THOUGHT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF HIM
THERE
'YES BUT SUPPOSE THE LEADS LIE THE BANK WOULD TELL YOU SO AND THEN
YOU'D STIR THOSE LEADSMEN UP A BIT
THERE WAS A TEN FOOT BANK HERE LAST
TRIP AND THERE IS ONLY A SIX FOOT BANK NOW
WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY
'THAT THE RIVER IS FOUR FEET HIGHER THAN IT WAS LAST TRIP
'VERY GOOD
IS THE RIVER RISING OR FALLING
'RISING
'NO IT AIN'T
'I GUESS I AM RIGHT SIR
YONDER IS SOME DRIFT WOOD FLOATING DOWN THE
STREAM
'A RISE STARTS THE DRIFT WOOD BUT THEN IT KEEPS ON FLOATING A WHILE
AFTER THE RIVER IS DONE RISING
NOW THE BANK WILL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS
WAIT TILL YOU COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SHELVES A LITTLE
NOW HERE DO
YOU SEE THIS NARROW BELT OF FINE SEDIMENT THAT WAS DEPOSITED WHILE THE
WATER WAS HIGHER
YOU SEE THE DRIFTWOOD BEGINS TO STRAND TOO
THE BANK
HELPS IN OTHER WAYS
DO YOU SEE THAT STUMP ON THE FALSE POINT
'AY AY SIR
'WELL THE WATER IS JUST UP TO THE ROOTS OF IT
YOU MUST MAKE A NOTE OF
THAT
'WHY
'BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S SEVEN FEET IN THE CHUTE OF 103
'BUT 103 IS A LONG WAY UP THE RIVER YET
'THAT'S WHERE THE BENEFIT OF THE BANK COMES IN
THERE IS WATER ENOUGH IN
103 NOW YET THERE MAY NOT BE BY THE TIME WE GET THERE BUT THE BANK
WILL KEEP US POSTED ALL ALONG
YOU DON'T RUN CLOSE CHUTES ON A FALLING
RIVER UP STREAM AND THERE ARE PRECIOUS FEW OF THEM THAT YOU ARE
ALLOWED TO RUN AT ALL DOWN STREAM
THERE'S A LAW OF THE UNITED STATES
AGAINST IT
THE RIVER MAY BE RISING BY THE TIME WE GET TO 103 AND IN
THAT CASE WE'LL RUN IT
WE ARE DRAWING HOW MUCH
'SIX FEET AFT SIX AND A HALF FORWARD
'WELL YOU DO SEEM TO KNOW SOMETHING
'BUT WHAT I PARTICULARLY WANT TO KNOW IS IF I HAVE GOT TO KEEP UP AN
EVERLASTING MEASURING OF THE BANKS OF THIS RIVER TWELVE HUNDRED MILES
MONTH IN AND MONTH OUT
'OF COURSE
MY EMOTIONS WERE TOO DEEP FOR WORDS FOR A WHILE
PRESENTLY I SAID
AND HOW ABOUT THESE CHUTES
ARE THERE MANY OF THEM
'I SHOULD SAY SO
I FANCY WE SHAN'T RUN ANY OF THE RIVER THIS TRIP AS
YOU'VE EVER SEEN IT RUN BEFORE SO TO SPEAK
IF THE RIVER BEGINS TO RISE
AGAIN WE'LL GO UP BEHIND BARS THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS SEEN STANDING OUT OF
THE RIVER HIGH AND DRY LIKE THE ROOF OF A HOUSE WE'LL CUT ACROSS LOW
PLACES THAT YOU'VE NEVER NOTICED AT ALL RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF
BARS THAT COVER THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF RIVER WE'LL CREEP THROUGH CRACKS
WHERE YOU'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT WAS SOLID LAND WE'LL DART THROUGH THE WOODS
AND LEAVE TWENTY FIVE MILES OF RIVER OFF TO ONE SIDE WE'LL SEE THE
HIND SIDE OF EVERY ISLAND BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS AND CAIRO
'THEN I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK AND LEARN JUST AS MUCH MORE RIVER AS I
ALREADY KNOW
'JUST ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH MORE AS NEAR AS YOU CAN COME AT IT
'WELL ONE LIVES TO FIND OUT
I THINK I WAS A FOOL WHEN I WENT INTO THIS
BUSINESS
'YES THAT IS TRUE
AND YOU ARE YET
BUT YOU'LL NOT BE WHEN YOU'VE
LEARNED IT
'AH I NEVER CAN LEARN IT
'I WILL SEE THAT YOU DO
BY AND BY I VENTURED AGAIN
'HAVE I GOT TO LEARN ALL THIS THING JUST AS I KNOW THE REST OF THE
RIVER SHAPES AND ALL AND SO I CAN RUN IT AT NIGHT
'YES
AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE GOOD FAIR MARKS FROM ONE END OF THE RIVER
TO THE OTHER THAT WILL HELP THE BANK TELL YOU WHEN THERE IS WATER
ENOUGH IN EACH OF THESE COUNTLESS PLACES LIKE THAT STUMP YOU KNOW
WHEN THE RIVER FIRST BEGINS TO RISE YOU CAN RUN HALF A DOZEN OF THE
DEEPEST OF THEM WHEN IT RISES A FOOT MORE YOU CAN RUN ANOTHER DOZEN
THE NEXT FOOT WILL ADD A COUPLE OF DOZEN AND SO ON SO YOU SEE YOU HAVE
TO KNOW YOUR BANKS AND MARKS TO A DEAD MORAL CERTAINTY AND NEVER GET
THEM MIXED FOR WHEN YOU START THROUGH ONE OF THOSE CRACKS THERE'S
NO BACKING OUT AGAIN AS THERE IS IN THE BIG RIVER YOU'VE GOT TO GO
THROUGH OR STAY THERE SIX MONTHS IF YOU GET CAUGHT ON A FALLING RIVER
THERE ARE ABOUT FIFTY OF THESE CRACKS WHICH YOU CAN'T RUN AT ALL EXCEPT
WHEN THE RIVER IS BRIM FULL AND OVER THE BANKS
'THIS NEW LESSON IS A CHEERFUL PROSPECT
'CHEERFUL ENOUGH
AND MIND WHAT I'VE JUST TOLD YOU WHEN YOU START INTO
ONE OF THOSE PLACES YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH
THEY ARE TOO NARROW TO
TURN AROUND IN TOO CROOKED TO BACK OUT OF AND THE SHOAL WATER IS
ALWAYS UP AT THE HEAD NEVER ELSEWHERE
AND THE HEAD OF THEM IS ALWAYS
LIKELY TO BE FILLING UP LITTLE BY LITTLE SO THAT THE MARKS YOU RECKON
THEIR DEPTH BY THIS SEASON MAY NOT ANSWER FOR NEXT
'LEARN A NEW SET THEN EVERY YEAR
'EXACTLY
CRAMP HER UP TO THE BAR WHAT ARE YOU STANDING UP THROUGH THE
MIDDLE OF THE RIVER FOR
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS SHOWED ME STRANGE THINGS
ON THE SAME DAY THAT WE
HELD THE CONVERSATION ABOVE NARRATED WE MET A GREAT RISE COMING DOWN
THE RIVER
THE WHOLE VAST FACE OF THE STREAM WAS BLACK WITH DRIFTING
DEAD LOGS BROKEN BOUGHS AND GREAT TREES THAT HAD CAVED IN AND BEEN
WASHED AWAY
IT REQUIRED THE NICEST STEERING TO PICK ONE'S WAY THROUGH
THIS RUSHING RAFT EVEN IN THE DAY TIME WHEN CROSSING FROM POINT TO
POINT AND AT NIGHT THE DIFFICULTY WAS MIGHTILY INCREASED EVERY NOW AND
THEN A HUGE LOG LYING DEEP IN THE WATER WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR RIGHT
UNDER OUR BOWS COMING HEAD ON NO USE TO TRY TO AVOID IT THEN WE COULD
ONLY STOP THE ENGINES AND ONE WHEEL WOULD WALK OVER THAT LOG FROM ONE
END TO THE OTHER KEEPING UP A THUNDERING RACKET AND CAREENING THE BOAT
IN A WAY THAT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO PASSENGERS
NOW AND THEN WE
WOULD HIT ONE OF THESE SUNKEN LOGS A RATTLING BANG DEAD IN THE CENTER
WITH A FULL HEAD OF STEAM AND IT WOULD STUN THE BOAT AS IF SHE HAD HIT
A CONTINENT
SOMETIMES THIS LOG WOULD LODGE AND STAY RIGHT ACROSS
OUR NOSE AND BACK THE MISSISSIPPI UP BEFORE IT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO A
LITTLE CRAW FISHING THEN TO GET AWAY FROM THE OBSTRUCTION
WE OFTEN
HIT WHITE LOGS IN THE DARK FOR WE COULD NOT SEE THEM TILL WE WERE
RIGHT ON THEM BUT A BLACK LOG IS A PRETTY DISTINCT OBJECT AT NIGHT
A
WHITE SNAG IS AN UGLY CUSTOMER WHEN THE DAYLIGHT IS GONE
OF COURSE ON THE GREAT RISE DOWN CAME A SWARM OF PRODIGIOUS
TIMBER RAFTS FROM THE HEAD WATERS OF THE MISSISSIPPI COAL BARGES FROM
PITTSBURGH LITTLE TRADING SCOWS FROM EVERYWHERE AND BROAD HORNS FROM
'POSEY COUNTY INDIANA FREIGHTED WITH 'FRUIT AND FURNITURE' THE
USUAL TERM FOR DESCRIBING IT THOUGH IN PLAIN ENGLISH THE FREIGHT THUS
AGGRANDIZED WAS HOOP POLES AND PUMPKINS
PILOTS BORE A MORTAL HATRED TO
THESE CRAFT AND IT WAS RETURNED WITH USURY
THE LAW REQUIRED ALL SUCH
HELPLESS TRADERS TO KEEP A LIGHT BURNING BUT IT WAS A LAW THAT WAS
OFTEN BROKEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN ON A MURKY NIGHT A LIGHT WOULD HOP UP
RIGHT UNDER OUR BOWS ALMOST AND AN AGONIZED VOICE WITH THE BACKWOODS
'WHANG' TO IT WOULD WAIL OUT
'WHAR'N THE YOU GOIN' TO CAIN'T YOU SEE NOTHIN' YOU DASH DASHED
AIG SUCKIN' SHEEP STEALIN' ONE EYED SON OF A STUFFED MONKEY
THEN FOR AN INSTANT AS WE WHISTLED BY THE RED GLARE FROM OUR FURNACES
WOULD REVEAL THE SCOW AND THE FORM OF THE GESTICULATING ORATOR AS IF
UNDER A LIGHTNING FLASH AND IN THAT INSTANT OUR FIREMEN AND DECK HANDS
WOULD SEND AND RECEIVE A TEMPEST OF MISSILES AND PROFANITY ONE OF OUR
WHEELS WOULD WALK OFF WITH THE CRASHING FRAGMENTS OF A STEERING OAR AND
DOWN THE DEAD BLACKNESS WOULD SHUT AGAIN
AND THAT FLATBOATMAN WOULD BE
SURE TO GO INTO NEW ORLEANS AND SUE OUR BOAT SWEARING STOUTLY THAT HE
HAD A LIGHT BURNING ALL THE TIME WHEN IN TRUTH HIS GANG HAD THE LANTERN
DOWN BELOW TO SING AND LIE AND DRINK AND GAMBLE BY AND NO WATCH ON
DECK
ONCE AT NIGHT IN ONE OF THOSE FOREST BORDERED CREVICES BEHIND AN
ISLAND WHICH STEAMBOATMEN INTENSELY DESCRIBE WITH THE PHRASE 'AS DARK
AS THE INSIDE OF A COW WE SHOULD HAVE EATEN UP A POSEY COUNTY FAMILY
FRUIT FURNITURE AND ALL BUT THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE FIDDLING DOWN
BELOW AND WE JUST CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC IN TIME TO SHEER OFF
DOING NO SERIOUS DAMAGE UNFORTUNATELY BUT COMING SO NEAR IT THAT WE
HAD GOOD HOPES FOR A MOMENT
THESE PEOPLE BROUGHT UP THEIR LANTERN
THEN OF COURSE AND AS WE BACKED AND FILLED TO GET AWAY THE PRECIOUS
FAMILY STOOD IN THE LIGHT OF IT BOTH SEXES AND VARIOUS AGES AND CURSED
US TILL EVERYTHING TURNED BLUE
ONCE A COALBOATMAN SENT A BULLET THROUGH
OUR PILOT HOUSE WHEN WE BORROWED A STEERING OAR OF HIM IN A VERY NARROW
PLACE
CHAPTER 11
THE RIVER RISES
DURING THIS BIG RISE THESE SMALL FRY CRAFT WERE AN INTOLERABLE NUISANCE
WE WERE RUNNING CHUTE AFTER CHUTE A NEW WORLD TO ME AND IF THERE WAS
A PARTICULARLY CRAMPED PLACE IN A CHUTE WE WOULD BE PRETTY SURE TO MEET
A BROAD HORN THERE AND IF HE FAILED TO BE THERE WE WOULD FIND HIM IN A
STILL WORSE LOCALITY NAMELY THE HEAD OF THE CHUTE ON THE SHOAL WATER
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO END OF PROFANE CORDIALITIES EXCHANGED
SOMETIMES IN THE BIG RIVER WHEN WE WOULD BE FEELING OUR WAY CAUTIOUSLY
ALONG THROUGH A FOG THE DEEP HUSH WOULD SUDDENLY BE BROKEN BY YELLS AND
A CLAMOR OF TIN PANS AND ALL IN INSTANT A LOG RAFT WOULD APPEAR VAGUELY
THROUGH THE WEBBY VEIL CLOSE UPON US AND THEN WE DID NOT WAIT TO SWAP
KNIVES BUT SNATCHED OUR ENGINE BELLS OUT BY THE ROOTS AND PILED ON ALL
THE STEAM WE HAD TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY ONE DOESN'T HIT A ROCK OR
A SOLID LOG CRAFT WITH A STEAMBOAT WHEN HE CAN GET EXCUSED
YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT MANY STEAMBOAT CLERKS ALWAYS CARRIED
A LARGE ASSORTMENT OF RELIGIOUS TRACTS WITH THEM IN THOSE OLD DEPARTED
STEAMBOATING DAYS
INDEED THEY DID
TWENTY TIMES A DAY WE WOULD BE
CRAMPING UP AROUND A BAR WHILE A STRING OF THESE SMALL FRY RASCALS
WERE DRIFTING DOWN INTO THE HEAD OF THE BEND AWAY ABOVE AND BEYOND US A
COUPLE OF MILES
NOW A SKIFF WOULD DART AWAY FROM ONE OF THEM AND COME
FIGHTING ITS LABORIOUS WAY ACROSS THE DESERT OF WATER
IT WOULD 'EASE
ALL IN THE SHADOW OF OUR FORECASTLE AND THE PANTING OARSMEN WOULD
SHOUT 'GIMME A PA A PER AS THE SKIFF DRIFTED SWIFTLY ASTERN
THE
CLERK WOULD THROW OVER A FILE OF NEW ORLEANS JOURNALS
IF THESE WERE
PICKED UP WITHOUT COMMENT YOU MIGHT NOTICE THAT NOW A DOZEN OTHER
SKIFFS HAD BEEN DRIFTING DOWN UPON US WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING
YOU
UNDERSTAND THEY HAD BEEN WAITING TO SEE HOW NO
1 WAS GOING TO FARE
NO
1 MAKING NO COMMENT ALL THE REST WOULD BEND TO THEIR OARS AND
COME ON NOW AND AS FAST AS THEY CAME THE CLERK WOULD HEAVE OVER
NEAT BUNDLES OF RELIGIOUS TRACTS TIED TO SHINGLES
THE AMOUNT OF HARD
SWEARING WHICH TWELVE PACKAGES OF RELIGIOUS LITERATURE WILL COMMAND WHEN
IMPARTIALLY DIVIDED UP AMONG TWELVE RAFTSMEN'S CREWS WHO HAVE PULLED A
HEAVY SKIFF TWO MILES ON A HOT DAY TO GET THEM IS SIMPLY INCREDIBLE
AS I HAVE SAID THE BIG RISE BROUGHT A NEW WORLD UNDER MY VISION
BY THE
TIME THE RIVER WAS OVER ITS BANKS WE HAD FORSAKEN OUR OLD PATHS AND WERE
HOURLY CLIMBING OVER BARS THAT HAD STOOD TEN FEET OUT OF WATER BEFORE
WE WERE SHAVING STUMPY SHORES LIKE THAT AT THE FOOT OF MADRID BEND
WHICH I HAD ALWAYS SEEN AVOIDED BEFORE WE WERE CLATTERING THROUGH
CHUTES LIKE THAT OF 82 WHERE THE OPENING AT THE FOOT WAS AN UNBROKEN
WALL OF TIMBER TILL OUR NOSE WAS ALMOST AT THE VERY SPOT
SOME OF THESE
CHUTES WERE UTTER SOLITUDES
THE DENSE UNTOUCHED FOREST OVERHUNG BOTH
BANKS OF THE CROOKED LITTLE CRACK AND ONE COULD BELIEVE THAT HUMAN
CREATURES HAD NEVER INTRUDED THERE BEFORE
THE SWINGING GRAPE VINES THE
GRASSY NOOKS AND VISTAS GLIMPSED AS WE SWEPT BY THE FLOWERING CREEPERS
WAVING THEIR RED BLOSSOMS FROM THE TOPS OF DEAD TRUNKS AND ALL THE
SPENDTHRIFT RICHNESS OF THE FOREST FOLIAGE WERE WASTED AND THROWN AWAY
THERE
THE CHUTES WERE LOVELY PLACES TO STEER IN THEY WERE DEEP EXCEPT
AT THE HEAD THE CURRENT WAS GENTLE UNDER THE 'POINTS' THE WATER WAS
ABSOLUTELY DEAD AND THE INVISIBLE BANKS SO BLUFF THAT WHERE THE TENDER
WILLOW THICKETS PROJECTED YOU COULD BURY YOUR BOAT'S BROADSIDE IN THEM
AS YOU TORE ALONG AND THEN YOU SEEMED FAIRLY TO FLY
BEHIND OTHER ISLANDS WE FOUND WRETCHED LITTLE FARMS AND WRETCHEDER
LITTLE LOG CABINS THERE WERE CRAZY RAIL FENCES STICKING A FOOT OR TWO
ABOVE THE WATER WITH ONE OR TWO JEANS CLAD CHILLS RACKED YELLOW FACED
MALE MISERABLES ROOSTING ON THE TOP RAIL ELBOWS ON KNEES JAWS IN
HANDS GRINDING TOBACCO AND DISCHARGING THE RESULT AT FLOATING CHIPS
THROUGH CREVICES LEFT BY LOST TEETH WHILE THE REST OF THE FAMILY AND
THE FEW FARM ANIMALS WERE HUDDLED TOGETHER IN AN EMPTY WOOD FLAT RIDING
AT HER MOORINGS CLOSE AT HAND
IN THIS FLAT BOAT THE FAMILY WOULD HAVE
TO COOK AND EAT AND SLEEP FOR A LESSER OR GREATER NUMBER OF DAYS OR
POSSIBLY WEEKS UNTIL THE RIVER SHOULD FALL TWO OR THREE FEET AND LET
THEM GET BACK TO THEIR LOG CABIN AND THEIR CHILLS AGAIN CHILLS BEING
A MERCIFUL PROVISION OF AN ALL WISE PROVIDENCE TO ENABLE THEM TO TAKE
EXERCISE WITHOUT EXERTION
AND THIS SORT OF WATERY CAMPING OUT WAS A
THING WHICH THESE PEOPLE WERE RATHER LIABLE TO BE TREATED TO A COUPLE
OF TIMES A YEAR BY THE DECEMBER RISE OUT OF THE OHIO AND THE JUNE RISE
OUT OF THE MISSISSIPPI
AND YET THESE WERE KINDLY DISPENSATIONS FOR
THEY AT LEAST ENABLED THE POOR THINGS TO RISE FROM THE DEAD NOW AND
THEN AND LOOK UPON LIFE WHEN A STEAMBOAT WENT BY
THEY APPRECIATED THE
BLESSING TOO FOR THEY SPREAD THEIR MOUTHS AND EYES WIDE OPEN AND MADE
THE MOST OF THESE OCCASIONS
NOW WHAT COULD THESE BANISHED CREATURES
FIND TO DO TO KEEP FROM DYING OF THE BLUES DURING THE LOW WATER SEASON
ONCE IN ONE OF THESE LOVELY ISLAND CHUTES WE FOUND OUR COURSE
COMPLETELY BRIDGED BY A GREAT FALLEN TREE
THIS WILL SERVE TO SHOW HOW
NARROW SOME OF THE CHUTES WERE
THE PASSENGERS HAD AN HOUR'S RECREATION
IN A VIRGIN WILDERNESS WHILE THE BOAT HANDS CHOPPED THE BRIDGE AWAY
FOR THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS TURNING BACK YOU COMPREHEND
FROM CAIRO TO BATON ROUGE WHEN THE RIVER IS OVER ITS BANKS YOU HAVE
NO PARTICULAR TROUBLE IN THE NIGHT FOR THE THOUSAND MILE WALL OF DENSE
FOREST THAT GUARDS THE TWO BANKS ALL THE WAY IS ONLY GAPPED WITH A FARM
OR WOOD YARD OPENING AT INTERVALS AND SO YOU CAN'T 'GET OUT OF THE
RIVER' MUCH EASIER THAN YOU COULD GET OUT OF A FENCED LANE BUT FROM
BATON ROUGE TO NEW ORLEANS IT IS A DIFFERENT MATTER
THE RIVER IS MORE
THAN A MILE WIDE AND VERY DEEP AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED FEET IN PLACES
BOTH BANKS FOR A GOOD DEAL OVER A HUNDRED MILES ARE SHORN OF THEIR
TIMBER AND BORDERED BY CONTINUOUS SUGAR PLANTATIONS WITH ONLY HERE AND
THERE A SCATTERING SAPLING OR ROW OF ORNAMENTAL CHINA TREES
THE TIMBER
IS SHORN OFF CLEAR TO THE REAR OF THE PLANTATIONS FROM TWO TO FOUR
MILES
WHEN THE FIRST FROST THREATENS TO COME THE PLANTERS SNATCH OFF
THEIR CROPS IN A HURRY
WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED GRINDING THE CANE THEY
FORM THE REFUSE OF THE STALKS WHICH THEY CALL BAGASSE INTO GREAT
PILES AND SET FIRE TO THEM THOUGH IN OTHER SUGAR COUNTRIES THE BAGASSE
IS USED FOR FUEL IN THE FURNACES OF THE SUGAR MILLS
NOW THE PILES OF
DAMP BAGASSE BURN SLOWLY AND SMOKE LIKE SATAN'S OWN KITCHEN
AN EMBANKMENT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET HIGH GUARDS BOTH BANKS OF THE
MISSISSIPPI ALL THE WAY DOWN THAT LOWER END OF THE RIVER AND THIS
EMBANKMENT IS SET BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE SHORE FROM TEN TO PERHAPS A
HUNDRED FEET ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES SAY THIRTY OR FORTY FEET AS
A GENERAL THING
FILL THAT WHOLE REGION WITH AN IMPENETRABLE GLOOM OF
SMOKE FROM A HUNDRED MILES OF BURNING BAGASSE PILES WHEN THE RIVER IS
OVER THE BANKS AND TURN A STEAMBOAT LOOSE ALONG THERE AT MIDNIGHT AND
SEE HOW SHE WILL FEEL
AND SEE HOW YOU WILL FEEL TOO YOU FIND YOURSELF
AWAY OUT IN THE MIDST OF A VAGUE DIM SEA THAT IS SHORELESS THAT FADES
OUT AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE MURKY DISTANCES FOR YOU CANNOT DISCERN
THE THIN RIB OF EMBANKMENT AND YOU ARE ALWAYS IMAGINING YOU SEE
A STRAGGLING TREE WHEN YOU DON'T
THE PLANTATIONS THEMSELVES ARE
TRANSFORMED BY THE SMOKE AND LOOK LIKE A PART OF THE SEA
ALL THROUGH
YOUR WATCH YOU ARE TORTURED WITH THE EXQUISITE MISERY OF UNCERTAINTY
YOU HOPE YOU ARE KEEPING IN THE RIVER BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW
ALL THAT YOU
ARE SURE ABOUT IS THAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO BE WITHIN SIX FEET OF THE BANK
AND DESTRUCTION WHEN YOU THINK YOU ARE A GOOD HALF MILE FROM SHORE
AND
YOU ARE SURE ALSO THAT IF YOU CHANCE SUDDENLY TO FETCH UP AGAINST THE
EMBANKMENT AND TOPPLE YOUR CHIMNEYS OVERBOARD YOU WILL HAVE THE SMALL
COMFORT OF KNOWING THAT IT IS ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTING TO DO
ONE
OF THE GREAT VICKSBURG PACKETS DARTED OUT INTO A SUGAR PLANTATION ONE
NIGHT AT SUCH A TIME AND HAD TO STAY THERE A WEEK
BUT THERE WAS NO
NOVELTY ABOUT IT IT HAD OFTEN BEEN DONE BEFORE
I THOUGHT I HAD FINISHED THIS CHAPTER BUT I WISH TO ADD A CURIOUS
THING WHILE IT IS IN MY MIND
IT IS ONLY RELEVANT IN THAT IT IS
CONNECTED WITH PILOTING
THERE USED TO BE AN EXCELLENT PILOT ON THE
RIVER A MR
X WHO WAS A SOMNAMBULIST
IT WAS SAID THAT IF HIS MIND
WAS TROUBLED ABOUT A BAD PIECE OF RIVER HE WAS PRETTY SURE TO GET UP
AND WALK IN HIS SLEEP AND DO STRANGE THINGS
HE WAS ONCE FELLOW PILOT
FOR A TRIP OR TWO WITH GEORGE EALER ON A GREAT NEW ORLEANS PASSENGER
PACKET
DURING A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE FIRST TRIP GEORGE WAS UNEASY
BUT GOT OVER IT BY AND BY AS X
SEEMED CONTENT TO STAY IN HIS BED WHEN
ASLEEP
LATE ONE NIGHT THE BOAT WAS APPROACHING HELENA ARKANSAS THE
WATER WAS LOW AND THE CROSSING ABOVE THE TOWN IN A VERY BLIND AND
TANGLED CONDITION
X
HAD SEEN THE CROSSING SINCE EALER HAD AND AS THE
NIGHT WAS PARTICULARLY DRIZZLY SULLEN AND DARK EALER WAS CONSIDERING
WHETHER HE HAD NOT BETTER HAVE X
CALLED TO ASSIST IN RUNNING THE PLACE
WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND X
WALKED IN
NOW ON VERY DARK NIGHTS LIGHT IS
A DEADLY ENEMY TO PILOTING YOU ARE AWARE THAT IF YOU STAND IN A LIGHTED
ROOM ON SUCH A NIGHT YOU CANNOT SEE THINGS IN THE STREET TO ANY
PURPOSE BUT IF YOU PUT OUT THE LIGHTS AND STAND IN THE GLOOM YOU CAN
MAKE OUT OBJECTS IN THE STREET PRETTY WELL
SO ON VERY DARK NIGHTS
PILOTS DO NOT SMOKE THEY ALLOW NO FIRE IN THE PILOT HOUSE STOVE IF
THERE IS A CRACK WHICH CAN ALLOW THE LEAST RAY TO ESCAPE THEY ORDER THE
FURNACES TO BE CURTAINED WITH HUGE TARPAULINS AND THE SKY LIGHTS TO
BE CLOSELY BLINDED
THEN NO LIGHT WHATEVER ISSUES FROM THE BOAT
THE
UNDEFINABLE SHAPE THAT NOW ENTERED THE PILOT HOUSE HAD MR
X 'S VOICE
THIS SAID
'LET ME TAKE HER GEORGE I'VE SEEN THIS PLACE SINCE YOU HAVE AND IT
IS SO CROOKED THAT I RECKON I CAN RUN IT MYSELF EASIER THAN I COULD TELL
YOU HOW TO DO IT
'IT IS KIND OF YOU AND I SWEAR I AM WILLING
I HAVEN'T GOT ANOTHER
DROP OF PERSPIRATION LEFT IN ME
I HAVE BEEN SPINNING AROUND AND AROUND
THE WHEEL LIKE A SQUIRREL
IT IS SO DARK I CAN'T TELL WHICH WAY SHE IS
SWINGING TILL SHE IS COMING AROUND LIKE A WHIRLIGIG
SO EALER TOOK A SEAT ON THE BENCH PANTING AND BREATHLESS
THE BLACK
PHANTOM ASSUMED THE WHEEL WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING STEADIED THE WALTZING
STEAMER WITH A TURN OR TWO AND THEN STOOD AT EASE COAXING HER A LITTLE
TO THIS SIDE AND THEN TO THAT AS GENTLY AND AS SWEETLY AS IF THE TIME
HAD BEEN NOONDAY
WHEN EALER OBSERVED THIS MARVEL OF STEERING HE WISHED
HE HAD NOT CONFESSED HE STARED AND WONDERED AND FINALLY SAID
'WELL I THOUGHT I KNEW HOW TO STEER A STEAMBOAT BUT THAT WAS ANOTHER
MISTAKE OF MINE
X
SAID NOTHING BUT WENT SERENELY ON WITH HIS WORK
HE RANG FOR THE
LEADS HE RANG TO SLOW DOWN THE STEAM HE WORKED THE BOAT CAREFULLY AND
NEATLY INTO INVISIBLE MARKS THEN STOOD AT THE CENTER OF THE WHEEL
AND PEERED BLANDLY OUT INTO THE BLACKNESS FORE AND AFT TO VERIFY HIS
POSITION AS THE LEADS SHOALED MORE AND MORE HE STOPPED THE ENGINES
ENTIRELY AND THE DEAD SILENCE AND SUSPENSE OF 'DRIFTING' FOLLOWED WHEN
THE SHOALEST WATER WAS STRUCK HE CRACKED ON THE STEAM CARRIED HER
HANDSOMELY OVER AND THEN BEGAN TO WORK HER WARILY INTO THE NEXT SYSTEM
OF SHOAL MARKS THE SAME PATIENT HEEDFUL USE OF LEADS AND ENGINES
FOLLOWED THE BOAT SLIPPED THROUGH WITHOUT TOUCHING BOTTOM AND ENTERED
UPON THE THIRD AND LAST INTRICACY OF THE CROSSING IMPERCEPTIBLY
SHE MOVED THROUGH THE GLOOM CREPT BY INCHES INTO HER MARKS DRIFTED
TEDIOUSLY TILL THE SHOALEST WATER WAS CRIED AND THEN UNDER A
TREMENDOUS HEAD OF STEAM WENT SWINGING OVER THE REEF AND AWAY INTO DEEP
WATER AND SAFETY
EALER LET HIS LONG PENT BREATH POUR OUT IN A GREAT RELIEVING SIGH AND
SAID
'THAT'S THE SWEETEST PIECE OF PILOTING THAT WAS EVER DONE ON THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER I WOULDN'T BELIEVED IT COULD BE DONE IF I HADN'T
SEEN IT
THERE WAS NO REPLY AND HE ADDED
'JUST HOLD HER FIVE MINUTES LONGER PARTNER AND LET ME RUN DOWN AND GET
A CUP OF COFFEE
A MINUTE LATER EALER WAS BITING INTO A PIE DOWN IN THE 'TEXAS AND
COMFORTING HIMSELF WITH COFFEE
JUST THEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN HAPPENED
IN AND WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN OUT AGAIN WHEN HE NOTICED EALER AND
EXCLAIMED
'WHO IS AT THE WHEEL SIR
'X
'DART FOR THE PILOT HOUSE QUICKER THAN LIGHTNING
THE NEXT MOMENT BOTH MEN WERE FLYING UP THE PILOT HOUSE COMPANION WAY
THREE STEPS AT A JUMP NOBODY THERE THE GREAT STEAMER WAS WHISTLING
DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AT HER OWN SWEET WILL THE WATCHMAN SHOT
OUT OF THE PLACE AGAIN EALER SEIZED THE WHEEL SET AN ENGINE BACK WITH
POWER AND HELD HIS BREATH WHILE THE BOAT RELUCTANTLY SWUNG AWAY FROM
A 'TOWHEAD' WHICH SHE WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE GULF OF
MEXICO
BY AND BY THE WATCHMAN CAME BACK AND SAID
'DIDN'T THAT LUNATIC TELL YOU HE WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE FIRST CAME UP
HERE
NO
'WELL HE WAS
I FOUND HIM WALKING ALONG ON TOP OF THE RAILINGS JUST AS
UNCONCERNED AS ANOTHER MAN WOULD WALK A PAVEMENT AND I PUT HIM TO BED
NOW JUST THIS MINUTE THERE HE WAS AGAIN AWAY ASTERN GOING THROUGH THAT
SORT OF TIGHT ROPE DEVILTRY THE SAME AS BEFORE
'WELL I THINK I'LL STAY BY NEXT TIME HE HAS ONE OF THOSE FITS
BUT I
HOPE HE'LL HAVE THEM OFTEN
YOU JUST OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN HIM TAKE THIS
BOAT THROUGH HELENA CROSSING
I NEVER SAW ANYTHING SO GAUDY BEFORE
AND
IF HE CAN DO SUCH GOLD LEAF KID GLOVE DIAMOND BREASTPIN PILOTING WHEN
HE IS SOUND ASLEEP WHAT COULDN'T HE DO IF HE WAS DEAD
CHAPTER 12
SOUNDING
WHEN THE RIVER IS VERY LOW AND ONE'S STEAMBOAT IS 'DRAWING ALL THE
WATER' THERE IS IN THE CHANNEL OR A FEW INCHES MORE AS WAS OFTEN
THE CASE IN THE OLD TIMES ONE MUST BE PAINFULLY CIRCUMSPECT IN HIS
PILOTING
WE USED TO HAVE TO 'SOUND' A NUMBER OF PARTICULARLY BAD PLACES
ALMOST EVERY TRIP WHEN THE RIVER WAS AT A VERY LOW STAGE
SOUNDING IS DONE IN THIS WAY
THE BOAT TIES UP AT THE SHORE JUST ABOVE
THE SHOAL CROSSING THE PILOT NOT ON WATCH TAKES HIS 'CUB' OR STEERSMAN
AND A PICKED CREW OF MEN SOMETIMES AN OFFICER ALSO AND GOES OUT IN
THE YAWL PROVIDED THE BOAT HAS NOT THAT RARE AND SUMPTUOUS LUXURY A
REGULARLY DEVISED 'SOUNDING BOAT' AND PROCEEDS TO HUNT FOR THE BEST
WATER THE PILOT ON DUTY WATCHING HIS MOVEMENTS THROUGH A SPY GLASS
MEANTIME AND IN SOME INSTANCES ASSISTING BY SIGNALS OF THE BOAT'S
WHISTLE SIGNIFYING 'TRY HIGHER UP' OR 'TRY LOWER DOWN FOR THE SURFACE
OF THE WATER LIKE AN OIL PAINTING IS MORE EXPRESSIVE AND INTELLIGIBLE
WHEN INSPECTED FROM A LITTLE DISTANCE THAN VERY CLOSE AT HAND
THE
WHISTLE SIGNALS ARE SELDOM NECESSARY HOWEVER NEVER PERHAPS EXCEPT
WHEN THE WIND CONFUSES THE SIGNIFICANT RIPPLES UPON THE WATER'S SURFACE
WHEN THE YAWL HAS REACHED THE SHOAL PLACE THE SPEED IS SLACKENED THE
PILOT BEGINS TO SOUND THE DEPTH WITH A POLE TEN OR TWELVE FEET LONG
AND THE STEERSMAN AT THE TILLER OBEYS THE ORDER TO 'HOLD HER UP TO
STARBOARD OR 'LET HER FALL OFF TO LARBOARD FOOTNOTE THE TERM
'LARBOARD' IS NEVER USED AT SEA NOW TO SIGNIFY THE LEFT HAND BUT WAS
ALWAYS USED ON THE RIVER IN MY TIME OR 'STEADY STEADY AS YOU GO
WHEN THE MEASUREMENTS INDICATE THAT THE YAWL IS APPROACHING THE SHOALEST
PART OF THE REEF THE COMMAND IS GIVEN TO 'EASE ALL THEN THE MEN STOP
ROWING AND THE YAWL DRIFTS WITH THE CURRENT
THE NEXT ORDER IS 'STAND
BY WITH THE BUOY THE MOMENT THE SHALLOWEST POINT IS REACHED THE PILOT
DELIVERS THE ORDER 'LET GO THE BUOY AND OVER SHE GOES
IF THE PILOT
IS NOT SATISFIED HE SOUNDS THE PLACE AGAIN IF HE FINDS BETTER WATER
HIGHER UP OR LOWER DOWN HE REMOVES THE BUOY TO THAT PLACE
BEING
FINALLY SATISFIED HE GIVES THE ORDER AND ALL THE MEN STAND THEIR
OARS STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR IN LINE A BLAST FROM THE BOAT'S WHISTLE
INDICATES THAT THE SIGNAL HAS BEEN SEEN THEN THE MEN 'GIVE WAY' ON
THEIR OARS AND LAY THE YAWL ALONGSIDE THE BUOY THE STEAMER COMES
CREEPING CAREFULLY DOWN IS POINTED STRAIGHT AT THE BUOY HUSBANDS HER
POWER FOR THE COMING STRUGGLE AND PRESENTLY AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT
TURNS ON ALL HER STEAM AND GOES GRINDING AND WALLOWING OVER THE BUOY AND
THE SAND AND GAINS THE DEEP WATER BEYOND
OR MAYBE SHE DOESN'T MAYBE
SHE 'STRIKES AND SWINGS THEN SHE HAS TO WHILE AWAY SEVERAL HOURS OR
DAYS SPARRING HERSELF OFF
SOMETIMES A BUOY IS NOT LAID AT ALL BUT THE YAWL GOES AHEAD HUNTING
THE BEST WATER AND THE STEAMER FOLLOWS ALONG IN ITS WAKE
OFTEN THERE
IS A DEAL OF FUN AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT SOUNDING ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A
GLORIOUS SUMMER DAY OR A BLUSTERING NIGHT
BUT IN WINTER THE COLD AND
THE PERIL TAKE MOST OF THE FUN OUT OF IT
A BUOY IS NOTHING BUT A BOARD FOUR OR FIVE FEET LONG WITH ONE END
TURNED UP IT IS A REVERSED SCHOOL HOUSE BENCH WITH ONE OF THE SUPPORTS
LEFT AND THE OTHER REMOVED
IT IS ANCHORED ON THE SHOALEST PART OF THE
REEF BY A ROPE WITH A HEAVY STONE MADE FAST TO THE END OF IT
BUT FOR
THE RESISTANCE OF THE TURNED UP END OF THE REVERSED BENCH THE CURRENT
WOULD PULL THE BUOY UNDER WATER
AT NIGHT A PAPER LANTERN WITH A CANDLE
IN IT IS FASTENED ON TOP OF THE BUOY AND THIS CAN BE SEEN A MILE OR
MORE A LITTLE GLIMMERING SPARK IN THE WASTE OF BLACKNESS
NOTHING DELIGHTS A CUB SO MUCH AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT SOUNDING
THERE IS SUCH AN AIR OF ADVENTURE ABOUT IT OFTEN THERE IS DANGER IT IS
SO GAUDY AND MAN OF WAR LIKE TO SIT UP IN THE STERN SHEETS AND STEER
A SWIFT YAWL THERE IS SOMETHING FINE ABOUT THE EXULTANT SPRING OF THE
BOAT WHEN AN EXPERIENCED OLD SAILOR CREW THROW THEIR SOULS INTO THE
OARS IT IS LOVELY TO SEE THE WHITE FOAM STREAM AWAY FROM THE BOWS
THERE IS MUSIC IN THE RUSH OF THE WATER IT IS DELICIOUSLY EXHILARATING
IN SUMMER TO GO SPEEDING OVER THE BREEZY EXPANSES OF THE RIVER WHEN THE
WORLD OF WAVELETS IS DANCING IN THE SUN
IT IS SUCH GRANDEUR TOO TO
THE CUB TO GET A CHANCE TO GIVE AN ORDER FOR OFTEN THE PILOT WILL
SIMPLY SAY 'LET HER GO ABOUT AND LEAVE THE REST TO THE CUB WHO
INSTANTLY CRIES IN HIS STERNEST TONE OF COMMAND 'EASE STARBOARD
STRONG ON THE LARBOARD STARBOARD GIVE WAY WITH A WILL MEN THE CUB
ENJOYS SOUNDING FOR THE FURTHER REASON THAT THE EYES OF THE PASSENGERS
ARE WATCHING ALL THE YAWL'S MOVEMENTS WITH ABSORBING INTEREST IF THE
TIME BE DAYLIGHT AND IF IT BE NIGHT HE KNOWS THAT THOSE SAME WONDERING
EYES ARE FASTENED UPON THE YAWL'S LANTERN AS IT GLIDES OUT INTO THE
GLOOM AND DIMS AWAY IN THE REMOTE DISTANCE
ONE TRIP A PRETTY GIRL OF SIXTEEN SPENT HER TIME IN OUR PILOT HOUSE WITH
HER UNCLE AND AUNT EVERY DAY AND ALL DAY LONG
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER
SO DID MR
THORNBURG'S CUB TOM G
TOM AND I HAD BEEN BOSOM FRIENDS
UNTIL THIS TIME BUT NOW A COOLNESS BEGAN TO ARISE
I TOLD THE GIRL A
GOOD MANY OF MY RIVER ADVENTURES AND MADE MYSELF OUT A GOOD DEAL OF A
HERO TOM TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF APPEAR TO BE A HERO TOO AND SUCCEEDED
TO SOME EXTENT BUT THEN HE ALWAYS HAD A WAY OF EMBROIDERING
HOWEVER
VIRTUE IS ITS OWN REWARD SO I WAS A BARELY PERCEPTIBLE TRIFLE AHEAD
IN THE CONTEST
ABOUT THIS TIME SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH PROMISED
HANDSOMELY FOR ME THE PILOTS DECIDED TO SOUND THE CROSSING AT THE HEAD
OF 21
THIS WOULD OCCUR ABOUT NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN
THE PASSENGERS WOULD BE STILL UP IT WOULD BE MR
THORNBURG'S WATCH
THEREFORE MY CHIEF WOULD HAVE TO DO THE SOUNDING
WE HAD A PERFECT LOVE
OF A SOUNDING BOAT LONG TRIM GRACEFUL AND AS FLEET AS A GREYHOUND
HER THWARTS WERE CUSHIONED SHE CARRIED TWELVE OARSMEN ONE OF THE MATES
WAS ALWAYS SENT IN HER TO TRANSMIT ORDERS TO HER CREW FOR OURS WAS A
STEAMER WHERE NO END OF 'STYLE' WAS PUT ON
WE TIED UP AT THE SHORE ABOVE 21 AND GOT READY
IT WAS A FOUL NIGHT
AND THE RIVER WAS SO WIDE THERE THAT A LANDSMAN'S UNEDUCATED EYES
COULD DISCERN NO OPPOSITE SHORE THROUGH SUCH A GLOOM
THE PASSENGERS
WERE ALERT AND INTERESTED EVERYTHING WAS SATISFACTORY
AS I HURRIED
THROUGH THE ENGINE ROOM PICTURESQUELY GOTTEN UP IN STORM TOGGERY I MET
TOM AND COULD NOT FORBEAR DELIVERING MYSELF OF A MEAN SPEECH
'AIN'T YOU GLAD YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT SOUNDING
TOM WAS PASSING ON BUT HE QUICKLY TURNED AND SAID
'NOW JUST FOR THAT YOU CAN GO AND GET THE SOUNDING POLE YOURSELF
I WAS
GOING AFTER IT BUT I'D SEE YOU IN HALIFAX NOW BEFORE I'D DO IT
'WHO WANTS YOU TO GET IT I DON'T
IT'S IN THE SOUNDING BOAT
'IT AIN'T EITHER
IT'S BEEN NEW PAINTED AND IT'S BEEN UP ON THE
LADIES' CABIN GUARDS TWO DAYS DRYING
I FLEW BACK AND SHORTLY ARRIVED AMONG THE CROWD OF WATCHING AND
WONDERING LADIES JUST IN TIME TO HEAR THE COMMAND
'GIVE WAY MEN
I LOOKED OVER AND THERE WAS THE GALLANT SOUNDING BOAT BOOMING AWAY THE
UNPRINCIPLED TOM PRESIDING AT THE TILLER AND MY CHIEF SITTING BY HIM
WITH THE SOUNDING POLE WHICH I HAD BEEN SENT ON A FOOL'S ERRAND TO
FETCH
THEN THAT YOUNG GIRL SAID TO ME
'OH HOW AWFUL TO HAVE TO GO OUT IN THAT LITTLE BOAT ON SUCH A NIGHT DO
YOU THINK THERE IS ANY DANGER
I WOULD RATHER HAVE BEEN STABBED
I WENT OFF FULL OF VENOM TO HELP IN
THE PILOT HOUSE
BY AND BY THE BOAT'S LANTERN DISAPPEARED AND AFTER AN
INTERVAL A WEE SPARK GLIMMERED UPON THE FACE OF THE WATER A MILE AWAY
MR
THORNBURG BLEW THE WHISTLE IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT BACKED THE STEAMER
OUT AND MADE FOR IT
WE FLEW ALONG FOR A WHILE THEN SLACKENED STEAM
AND WENT CAUTIOUSLY GLIDING TOWARD THE SPARK
PRESENTLY MR
THORNBURG
EXCLAIMED
'HELLO THE BUOY LANTERN'S OUT
HE STOPPED THE ENGINES
A MOMENT OR TWO LATER HE SAID
'WHY THERE IT IS AGAIN
SO HE CAME AHEAD ON THE ENGINES ONCE MORE AND RANG FOR THE LEADS
GRADUALLY THE WATER SHOALED UP AND THEN BEGAN TO DEEPEN AGAIN MR
THORNBURG MUTTERED
'WELL I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS
I BELIEVE THAT BUOY HAS DRIFTED OFF THE
REEF
SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE TOO FAR TO THE LEFT
NO MATTER IT IS SAFEST
TO RUN OVER IT ANYHOW
SO IN THAT SOLID WORLD OF DARKNESS WE WENT CREEPING DOWN ON THE LIGHT
JUST AS OUR BOWS WERE IN THE ACT OF PLOWING OVER IT MR
THORNBURG
SEIZED THE BELL ROPES RANG A STARTLING PEAL AND EXCLAIMED
'MY SOUL IT'S THE SOUNDING BOAT
A SUDDEN CHORUS OF WILD ALARMS BURST OUT FAR BELOW A PAUSE AND THEN
THE SOUND OF GRINDING AND CRASHING FOLLOWED
MR
THORNBURG EXCLAIMED
'THERE THE PADDLE WHEEL HAS GROUND THE SOUNDING BOAT TO LUCIFER
MATCHES RUN SEE WHO IS KILLED
I WAS ON THE MAIN DECK IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
MY CHIEF AND THE
THIRD MATE AND NEARLY ALL THE MEN WERE SAFE
THEY HAD DISCOVERED THEIR
DANGER WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE TO PULL OUT OF THE WAY THEN WHEN THE GREAT
GUARDS OVERSHADOWED THEM A MOMENT LATER THEY WERE PREPARED AND KNEW
WHAT TO DO AT MY CHIEFS ORDER THEY SPRANG AT THE RIGHT INSTANT SEIZED
THE GUARD AND WERE HAULED ABOARD
THE NEXT MOMENT THE SOUNDING YAWL
SWEPT AFT TO THE WHEEL AND WAS STRUCK AND SPLINTERED TO ATOMS
TWO OF
THE MEN AND THE CUB TOM WERE MISSING A FACT WHICH SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE
OVER THE BOAT
THE PASSENGERS CAME FLOCKING TO THE FORWARD GANGWAY
LADIES AND ALL ANXIOUS EYED WHITE FACED AND TALKED IN AWED VOICES OF
THE DREADFUL THING
AND OFTEN AND AGAIN I HEARD THEM SAY 'POOR FELLOWS
POOR BOY POOR BOY
BY THIS TIME THE BOAT'S YAWL WAS MANNED AND AWAY TO SEARCH FOR THE
MISSING
NOW A FAINT CALL WAS HEARD OFF TO THE LEFT
THE YAWL HAD
DISAPPEARED IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
HALF THE PEOPLE RUSHED TO ONE SIDE
TO ENCOURAGE THE SWIMMER WITH THEIR SHOUTS THE OTHER HALF RUSHED THE
OTHER WAY TO SHRIEK TO THE YAWL TO TURN ABOUT
BY THE CALLINGS
THE SWIMMER WAS APPROACHING BUT SOME SAID THE SOUND SHOWED FAILING
STRENGTH
THE CROWD MASSED THEMSELVES AGAINST THE BOILER DECK RAILINGS
LEANING OVER AND STARING INTO THE GLOOM AND EVERY FAINT AND FAINTER CRY
WRUNG FROM THEM SUCH WORDS AS 'AH POOR FELLOW POOR FELLOW IS THERE
NO WAY TO SAVE HIM
BUT STILL THE CRIES HELD OUT AND DREW NEARER AND PRESENTLY THE VOICE
SAID PLUCKILY
'I CAN MAKE IT STAND BY WITH A ROPE
WHAT A ROUSING CHEER THEY GAVE HIM THE CHIEF MATE TOOK HIS STAND IN THE
GLARE OF A TORCH BASKET A COIL OF ROPE IN HIS HAND AND HIS MEN GROUPED
ABOUT HIM
THE NEXT MOMENT THE SWIMMER'S FACE APPEARED IN THE CIRCLE OF
LIGHT AND IN ANOTHER ONE THE OWNER OF IT WAS HAULED ABOARD LIMP AND
DRENCHED WHILE CHEER ON CHEER WENT UP
IT WAS THAT DEVIL TOM
THE YAWL CREW SEARCHED EVERYWHERE BUT FOUND NO SIGN OF THE TWO MEN
THEY PROBABLY FAILED TO CATCH THE GUARD TUMBLED BACK AND WERE STRUCK
BY THE WHEEL AND KILLED
TOM HAD NEVER JUMPED FOR THE GUARD AT ALL BUT
HAD PLUNGED HEAD FIRST INTO THE RIVER AND DIVED UNDER THE WHEEL
IT WAS
NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE IT EASY ENOUGH AND I SAID SO BUT EVERYBODY
WENT ON JUST THE SAME MAKING A WONDERFUL TO DO OVER THAT ASS AS IF HE
HAD DONE SOMETHING GREAT
THAT GIRL COULDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT
PITIFUL 'HERO' THE REST OF THE TRIP BUT LITTLE I CARED I LOATHED HER
ANY WAY
THE WAY WE CAME TO MISTAKE THE SOUNDING BOAT'S LANTERN FOR THE
BUOY LIGHT WAS THIS
MY CHIEF SAID THAT AFTER LAYING THE BUOY HE FELL
AWAY AND WATCHED IT TILL IT SEEMED TO BE SECURE THEN HE TOOK UP A
POSITION A HUNDRED YARDS BELOW IT AND A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE OF THE
STEAMER'S COURSE HEADED THE SOUNDING BOAT UP STREAM AND WAITED
HAVING
TO WAIT SOME TIME HE AND THE OFFICER GOT TO TALKING HE LOOKED UP WHEN
HE JUDGED THAT THE STEAMER WAS ABOUT ON THE REEF SAW THAT THE BUOY WAS
GONE BUT SUPPOSED THAT THE STEAMER HAD ALREADY RUN OVER IT HE WENT
ON WITH HIS TALK HE NOTICED THAT THE STEAMER WAS GETTING VERY CLOSE ON
HIM BUT THAT WAS THE CORRECT THING IT WAS HER BUSINESS TO SHAVE HIM
CLOSELY FOR CONVENIENCE IN TAKING HIM ABOARD HE WAS EXPECTING HER TO
SHEER OFF UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THEN IT FLASHED UPON HIM THAT SHE WAS
TRYING TO RUN HIM DOWN MISTAKING HIS LANTERN FOR THE BUOY LIGHT SO HE
SANG OUT 'STAND BY TO SPRING FOR THE GUARD MEN AND THE NEXT INSTANT
THE JUMP WAS MADE
CHAPTER 13
A PILOT'S NEEDS
BUT I AM WANDERING FROM WHAT I WAS INTENDING TO DO THAT IS MAKE
PLAINER THAN PERHAPS APPEARS IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS SOME OF THE
PECULIAR REQUIREMENTS OF THE SCIENCE OF PILOTING
FIRST OF ALL THERE
IS ONE FACULTY WHICH A PILOT MUST INCESSANTLY CULTIVATE UNTIL HE HAS
BROUGHT IT TO ABSOLUTE PERFECTION
NOTHING SHORT OF PERFECTION WILL DO
THAT FACULTY IS MEMORY
HE CANNOT STOP WITH MERELY THINKING A THING IS
SO AND SO HE MUST KNOW IT FOR THIS IS EMINENTLY ONE OF THE 'EXACT'
SCIENCES
WITH WHAT SCORN A PILOT WAS LOOKED UPON IN THE OLD TIMES IF
HE EVER VENTURED TO DEAL IN THAT FEEBLE PHRASE 'I THINK INSTEAD OF THE
VIGOROUS ONE 'I KNOW ONE CANNOT EASILY REALIZE WHAT A TREMENDOUS THING
IT IS TO KNOW EVERY TRIVIAL DETAIL OF TWELVE HUNDRED MILES OF RIVER AND
KNOW IT WITH ABSOLUTE EXACTNESS
IF YOU WILL TAKE THE LONGEST STREET
IN NEW YORK AND TRAVEL UP AND DOWN IT CONNING ITS FEATURES PATIENTLY
UNTIL YOU KNOW EVERY HOUSE AND WINDOW AND DOOR AND LAMP POST AND BIG AND
LITTLE SIGN BY HEART AND KNOW THEM SO ACCURATELY THAT YOU CAN INSTANTLY
NAME THE ONE YOU ARE ABREAST OF WHEN YOU ARE SET DOWN AT RANDOM IN
THAT STREET IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INKY BLACK NIGHT YOU WILL THEN HAVE A
TOLERABLE NOTION OF THE AMOUNT AND THE EXACTNESS OF A PILOT'S KNOWLEDGE
WHO CARRIES THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN HIS HEAD
AND THEN IF YOU WILL
GO ON UNTIL YOU KNOW EVERY STREET CROSSING THE CHARACTER SIZE AND
POSITION OF THE CROSSING STONES AND THE VARYING DEPTH OF MUD IN EACH OF
THOSE NUMBERLESS PLACES YOU WILL HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE PILOT MUST
KNOW IN ORDER TO KEEP A MISSISSIPPI STEAMER OUT OF TROUBLE
NEXT IF
YOU WILL TAKE HALF OF THE SIGNS IN THAT LONG STREET AND CHANGE THEIR
PLACES ONCE A MONTH AND STILL MANAGE TO KNOW THEIR NEW POSITIONS
ACCURATELY ON DARK NIGHTS AND KEEP UP WITH THESE REPEATED CHANGES
WITHOUT MAKING ANY MISTAKES YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REQUIRED OF A
PILOT'S PEERLESS MEMORY BY THE FICKLE MISSISSIPPI
I THINK A PILOT'S MEMORY IS ABOUT THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN THE WORLD
TO KNOW THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS BY HEART AND BE ABLE TO RECITE THEM
GLIBLY FORWARD OR BACKWARD OR BEGIN AT RANDOM ANYWHERE IN THE BOOK
AND RECITE BOTH WAYS AND NEVER TRIP OR MAKE A MISTAKE IS NO EXTRAVAGANT
MASS OF KNOWLEDGE AND NO MARVELOUS FACILITY COMPARED TO A PILOT'S
MASSED KNOWLEDGE OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND HIS MARVELOUS FACILITY IN THE
HANDLING OF IT
I MAKE THIS COMPARISON DELIBERATELY AND BELIEVE I AM
NOT EXPANDING THE TRUTH WHEN I DO IT
MANY WILL THINK MY FIGURE TOO
STRONG BUT PILOTS WILL NOT
AND HOW EASILY AND COMFORTABLY THE PILOT'S MEMORY DOES ITS WORK HOW
PLACIDLY EFFORTLESS IS ITS WAY HOW UNCONSCIOUSLY IT LAYS UP ITS VAST
STORES HOUR BY HOUR DAY BY DAY AND NEVER LOSES OR MISLAYS A SINGLE
VALUABLE PACKAGE OF THEM ALL TAKE AN INSTANCE
LET A LEADSMAN CRY
'HALF TWAIN HALF TWAIN HALF TWAIN HALF TWAIN HALF TWAIN UNTIL
IT BECOME AS MONOTONOUS AS THE TICKING OF A CLOCK LET CONVERSATION BE
GOING ON ALL THE TIME AND THE PILOT BE DOING HIS SHARE OF THE TALKING
AND NO LONGER CONSCIOUSLY LISTENING TO THE LEADSMAN AND IN THE MIDST
OF THIS ENDLESS STRING OF HALF TWAINS LET A SINGLE 'QUARTER TWAIN BE
INTERJECTED WITHOUT EMPHASIS AND THEN THE HALF TWAIN CRY GO ON AGAIN
JUST AS BEFORE TWO OR THREE WEEKS LATER THAT PILOT CAN DESCRIBE WITH
PRECISION THE BOAT'S POSITION IN THE RIVER WHEN THAT QUARTER TWAIN
WAS UTTERED AND GIVE YOU SUCH A LOT OF HEAD MARKS STERN MARKS AND
SIDE MARKS TO GUIDE YOU THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE BOAT
THERE AND PUT HER IN THAT SAME SPOT AGAIN YOURSELF THE CRY OF 'QUARTER
TWAIN' DID NOT REALLY TAKE HIS MIND FROM HIS TALK BUT HIS TRAINED
FACULTIES INSTANTLY PHOTOGRAPHED THE BEARINGS NOTED THE CHANGE OF
DEPTH AND LAID UP THE IMPORTANT DETAILS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE WITHOUT
REQUIRING ANY ASSISTANCE FROM HIM IN THE MATTER
IF YOU WERE WALKING
AND TALKING WITH A FRIEND AND ANOTHER FRIEND AT YOUR SIDE KEPT UP A
MONOTONOUS REPETITION OF THE VOWEL SOUND A FOR A COUPLE OF BLOCKS AND
THEN IN THE MIDST INTERJECTED AN R THUS A A A A A R A A A
ETC AND GAVE THE R NO EMPHASIS YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STATE TWO OR
THREE WEEKS AFTERWARD THAT THE R HAD BEEN PUT IN NOR BE ABLE TO TELL
WHAT OBJECTS YOU WERE PASSING AT THE MOMENT IT WAS DONE
BUT YOU COULD
IF YOUR MEMORY HAD BEEN PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY TRAINED TO DO THAT
SORT OF THING MECHANICALLY
GIVE A MAN A TOLERABLY FAIR MEMORY TO START WITH AND PILOTING WILL
DEVELOP IT INTO A VERY COLOSSUS OF CAPABILITY
BUT ONLY IN THE MATTERS
IT IS DAILY DRILLED IN
A TIME WOULD COME WHEN THE MAN'S FACULTIES
COULD NOT HELP NOTICING LANDMARKS AND SOUNDINGS AND HIS MEMORY COULD
NOT HELP HOLDING ON TO THEM WITH THE GRIP OF A VISE BUT IF YOU ASKED
THAT SAME MAN AT NOON WHAT HE HAD HAD FOR BREAKFAST IT WOULD BE TEN
CHANCES TO ONE THAT HE COULD NOT TELL YOU
ASTONISHING THINGS CAN BE
DONE WITH THE HUMAN MEMORY IF YOU WILL DEVOTE IT FAITHFULLY TO ONE
PARTICULAR LINE OF BUSINESS
AT THE TIME THAT WAGES SOARED SO HIGH ON THE MISSOURI RIVER MY CHIEF
MR
BIXBY WENT UP THERE AND LEARNED MORE THAN A THOUSAND MILES OF THAT
STREAM WITH AN EASE AND RAPIDITY THAT WERE ASTONISHING
WHEN HE HAD SEEN
EACH DIVISION ONCE IN THE DAYTIME AND ONCE AT NIGHT HIS EDUCATION WAS
SO NEARLY COMPLETE THAT HE TOOK OUT A 'DAYLIGHT' LICENSE A FEW
TRIPS LATER HE TOOK OUT A FULL LICENSE AND WENT TO PILOTING DAY AND
NIGHT AND HE RANKED A 1 TOO
MR
BIXBY PLACED ME AS STEERSMAN FOR A WHILE UNDER A PILOT WHOSE FEATS
OF MEMORY WERE A CONSTANT MARVEL TO ME
HOWEVER HIS MEMORY WAS BORN IN
HIM I THINK NOT BUILT
FOR INSTANCE SOMEBODY WOULD MENTION A NAME
INSTANTLY MR
BROWN WOULD BREAK IN
'OH I KNEW HIM
SALLOW FACED RED HEADED FELLOW WITH A LITTLE SCAR
ON THE SIDE OF HIS THROAT LIKE A SPLINTER UNDER THE FLESH
HE WAS ONLY
IN THE SOUTHERN TRADE SIX MONTHS
THAT WAS THIRTEEN YEARS AGO
I MADE A
TRIP WITH HIM
THERE WAS FIVE FEET IN THE UPPER RIVER THEN THE HENRY
BLAKE GROUNDED AT THE FOOT OF TOWER ISLAND DRAWING FOUR AND A HALF THE
GEORGE ELLIOTT UNSHIPPED HER RUDDER ON THE WRECK OF THE SUNFLOWER
'WHY THE SUNFLOWER DIDN'T SINK UNTIL
'I KNOW WHEN SHE SUNK IT WAS THREE YEARS BEFORE THAT ON THE 2ND OF
DECEMBER ASA HARDY WAS CAPTAIN OF HER AND HIS BROTHER JOHN WAS FIRST
CLERK AND IT WAS HIS FIRST TRIP IN HER TOO TOM JONES TOLD ME THESE
THINGS A WEEK AFTERWARD IN NEW ORLEANS HE WAS FIRST MATE OF THE
SUNFLOWER CAPTAIN HARDY STUCK A NAIL IN HIS FOOT THE 6TH OF JULY OF
THE NEXT YEAR AND DIED OF THE LOCKJAW ON THE 15TH
HIS BROTHER DIED
TWO YEARS AFTER 3RD OF MARCH ERYSIPELAS
I NEVER SAW EITHER OF THE
HARDYS THEY WERE ALLEGHANY RIVER MEN BUT PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEM TOLD
ME ALL THESE THINGS
AND THEY SAID CAPTAIN HARDY WORE YARN SOCKS WINTER
AND SUMMER JUST THE SAME AND HIS FIRST WIFE'S NAME WAS JANE SHOOK SHE
WAS FROM NEW ENGLAND AND HIS SECOND ONE DIED IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM
IT
WAS IN THE BLOOD
SHE WAS FROM LEXINGTON KENTUCKY
NAME WAS HORTON
BEFORE SHE WAS MARRIED
AND SO ON BY THE HOUR THE MAN'S TONGUE WOULD GO
HE COULD NOT FORGET
ANY THING
IT WAS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE
THE MOST TRIVIAL DETAILS REMAINED
AS DISTINCT AND LUMINOUS IN HIS HEAD AFTER THEY HAD LAIN THERE FOR
YEARS AS THE MOST MEMORABLE EVENTS
HIS WAS NOT SIMPLY A PILOT'S
MEMORY ITS GRASP WAS UNIVERSAL
IF HE WERE TALKING ABOUT A TRIFLING
LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED SEVEN YEARS BEFORE HE WAS PRETTY SURE TO DELIVER
YOU THE ENTIRE SCREED FROM MEMORY
AND THEN WITHOUT OBSERVING THAT HE
WAS DEPARTING FROM THE TRUE LINE OF HIS TALK HE WAS MORE THAN LIKELY
TO HURL IN A LONG DRAWN PARENTHETICAL BIOGRAPHY OF THE WRITER OF THAT
LETTER AND YOU WERE LUCKY INDEED IF HE DID NOT TAKE UP THAT WRITER'S
RELATIVES ONE BY ONE AND GIVE YOU THEIR BIOGRAPHIES TOO
SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT IS A GREAT MISFORTUNE
TO IT ALL OCCURRENCES
ARE OF THE SAME SIZE
ITS POSSESSOR CANNOT DISTINGUISH AN INTERESTING
CIRCUMSTANCE FROM AN UNINTERESTING ONE
AS A TALKER HE IS BOUND TO CLOG
HIS NARRATIVE WITH TIRESOME DETAILS AND MAKE HIMSELF AN INSUFFERABLE
BORE
MOREOVER HE CANNOT STICK TO HIS SUBJECT
HE PICKS UP EVERY LITTLE
GRAIN OF MEMORY HE DISCERNS IN HIS WAY AND SO IS LED ASIDE
MR
BROWN
WOULD START OUT WITH THE HONEST INTENTION OF TELLING YOU A VASTLY FUNNY
ANECDOTE ABOUT A DOG
HE WOULD BE 'SO FULL OF LAUGH' THAT HE COULD
HARDLY BEGIN THEN HIS MEMORY WOULD START WITH THE DOG'S BREED AND
PERSONAL APPEARANCE DRIFT INTO A HISTORY OF HIS OWNER OF HIS OWNER'S
FAMILY WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF WEDDINGS AND BURIALS THAT HAD OCCURRED IN
IT TOGETHER WITH RECITALS OF CONGRATULATORY VERSES AND OBITUARY POETRY
PROVOKED BY THE SAME THEN THIS MEMORY WOULD RECOLLECT THAT ONE OF THESE
EVENTS OCCURRED DURING THE CELEBRATED 'HARD WINTER' OF SUCH AND SUCH A
YEAR AND A MINUTE DESCRIPTION OF THAT WINTER WOULD FOLLOW ALONG WITH
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE FROZEN TO DEATH AND STATISTICS SHOWING THE
HIGH FIGURES WHICH PORK AND HAY WENT UP TO
PORK AND HAY WOULD SUGGEST
CORN AND FODDER CORN AND FODDER WOULD SUGGEST COWS AND HORSES COWS AND
HORSES WOULD SUGGEST THE CIRCUS AND CERTAIN CELEBRATED BARE BACK RIDERS
THE TRANSITION FROM THE CIRCUS TO THE MENAGERIE WAS EASY AND NATURAL
FROM THE ELEPHANT TO EQUATORIAL AFRICA WAS BUT A STEP THEN OF COURSE
THE HEATHEN SAVAGES WOULD SUGGEST RELIGION AND AT THE END OF THREE OR
FOUR HOURS' TEDIOUS JAW THE WATCH WOULD CHANGE AND BROWN WOULD GO OUT
OF THE PILOT HOUSE MUTTERING EXTRACTS FROM SERMONS HE HAD HEARD YEARS
BEFORE ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF PRAYER AS A MEANS OF GRACE
AND THE
ORIGINAL FIRST MENTION WOULD BE ALL YOU HAD LEARNED ABOUT THAT DOG
AFTER ALL THIS WAITING AND HUNGERING
A PILOT MUST HAVE A MEMORY BUT THERE ARE TWO HIGHER QUALITIES WHICH HE
MUST ALSO HAVE
HE MUST HAVE GOOD AND QUICK JUDGMENT AND DECISION AND A
COOL CALM COURAGE THAT NO PERIL CAN SHAKE
GIVE A MAN THE MEREST TRIFLE
OF PLUCK TO START WITH AND BY THE TIME HE HAS BECOME A PILOT HE CANNOT
BE UNMANNED BY ANY DANGER A STEAMBOAT CAN GET INTO BUT ONE CANNOT QUITE
SAY THE SAME FOR JUDGMENT
JUDGMENT IS A MATTER OF BRAINS AND A MAN
MUST START WITH A GOOD STOCK OF THAT ARTICLE OR HE WILL NEVER SUCCEED
AS A PILOT
THE GROWTH OF COURAGE IN THE PILOT HOUSE IS STEADY ALL THE TIME BUT IT
DOES NOT REACH A HIGH AND SATISFACTORY CONDITION UNTIL SOME TIME AFTER
THE YOUNG PILOT HAS BEEN 'STANDING HIS OWN WATCH ALONE AND UNDER
THE STAGGERING WEIGHT OF ALL THE RESPONSIBILITIES CONNECTED WITH THE
POSITION
WHEN AN APPRENTICE HAS BECOME PRETTY THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED
WITH THE RIVER HE GOES CLATTERING ALONG SO FEARLESSLY WITH HIS
STEAMBOAT NIGHT OR DAY THAT HE PRESENTLY BEGINS TO IMAGINE THAT IT IS
HIS COURAGE THAT ANIMATES HIM BUT THE FIRST TIME THE PILOT STEPS OUT
AND LEAVES HIM TO HIS OWN DEVICES HE FINDS OUT IT WAS THE OTHER MAN'S
HE DISCOVERS THAT THE ARTICLE HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF HIS OWN CARGO
ALTOGETHER
THE WHOLE RIVER IS BRISTLING WITH EXIGENCIES IN A MOMENT
HE IS NOT PREPARED FOR THEM HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO MEET THEM ALL HIS
KNOWLEDGE FORSAKES HIM AND WITHIN FIFTEEN MINUTES HE IS AS WHITE AS A
SHEET AND SCARED ALMOST TO DEATH
THEREFORE PILOTS WISELY TRAIN THESE
CUBS BY VARIOUS STRATEGIC TRICKS TO LOOK DANGER IN THE FACE A LITTLE
MORE CALMLY
A FAVORITE WAY OF THEIRS IS TO PLAY A FRIENDLY SWINDLE UPON
THE CANDIDATE
MR
BIXBY SERVED ME IN THIS FASHION ONCE AND FOR YEARS AFTERWARD I
USED TO BLUSH EVEN IN MY SLEEP WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT
I HAD BECOME A GOOD
STEERSMAN SO GOOD INDEED THAT I HAD ALL THE WORK TO DO ON OUR WATCH
NIGHT AND DAY MR
BIXBY SELDOM MADE A SUGGESTION TO ME ALL HE EVER DID
WAS TO TAKE THE WHEEL ON PARTICULARLY BAD NIGHTS OR IN PARTICULARLY BAD
CROSSINGS LAND THE BOAT WHEN SHE NEEDED TO BE LANDED PLAY GENTLEMAN OF
LEISURE NINE TENTHS OF THE WATCH AND COLLECT THE WAGES
THE LOWER RIVER
WAS ABOUT BANK FULL AND IF ANYBODY HAD QUESTIONED MY ABILITY TO RUN ANY
CROSSING BETWEEN CAIRO AND NEW ORLEANS WITHOUT HELP OR INSTRUCTION
I SHOULD HAVE FELT IRREPARABLY HURT
THE IDEA OF BEING AFRAID OF ANY
CROSSING IN THE LOT IN THE DAY TIME WAS A THING TOO PREPOSTEROUS FOR
CONTEMPLATION
WELL ONE MATCHLESS SUMMER'S DAY I WAS BOWLING DOWN THE
BEND ABOVE ISLAND 66 BRIMFUL OF SELF CONCEIT AND CARRYING MY NOSE AS
HIGH AS A GIRAFFE'S WHEN MR
BIXBY SAID
'I AM GOING BELOW A WHILE
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THE NEXT CROSSING
THIS WAS ALMOST AN AFFRONT
IT WAS ABOUT THE PLAINEST AND SIMPLEST
CROSSING IN THE WHOLE RIVER
ONE COULDN'T COME TO ANY HARM WHETHER HE
RAN IT RIGHT OR NOT AND AS FOR DEPTH THERE NEVER HAD BEEN ANY BOTTOM
THERE
I KNEW ALL THIS PERFECTLY WELL
'KNOW HOW TO RUN IT WHY I CAN RUN IT WITH MY EYES SHUT
'HOW MUCH WATER IS THERE IN IT
'WELL THAT IS AN ODD QUESTION
I COULDN'T GET BOTTOM THERE WITH A
CHURCH STEEPLE
'YOU THINK SO DO YOU
THE VERY TONE OF THE QUESTION SHOOK MY CONFIDENCE
THAT WAS WHAT MR
BIXBY WAS EXPECTING
HE LEFT WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING MORE
I BEGAN TO
IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF THINGS
MR
BIXBY UNKNOWN TO ME OF COURSE SENT
SOMEBODY DOWN TO THE FORECASTLE WITH SOME MYSTERIOUS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE
LEADSMEN ANOTHER MESSENGER WAS SENT TO WHISPER AMONG THE OFFICERS
AND THEN MR
BIXBY WENT INTO HIDING BEHIND A SMOKE STACK WHERE HE COULD
OBSERVE RESULTS
PRESENTLY THE CAPTAIN STEPPED OUT ON THE HURRICANE
DECK NEXT THE CHIEF MATE APPEARED THEN A CLERK
EVERY MOMENT OR TWO A
STRAGGLER WAS ADDED TO MY AUDIENCE AND BEFORE I GOT TO THE HEAD OF
THE ISLAND I HAD FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PEOPLE ASSEMBLED DOWN THERE UNDER MY
NOSE
I BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
AS I STARTED ACROSS THE
CAPTAIN GLANCED ALOFT AT ME AND SAID WITH A SHAM UNEASINESS IN HIS
VOICE
'WHERE IS MR
BIXBY
'GONE BELOW SIR
BUT THAT DID THE BUSINESS FOR ME
MY IMAGINATION BEGAN TO CONSTRUCT
DANGERS OUT OF NOTHING AND THEY MULTIPLIED FASTER THAN I COULD KEEP THE
RUN OF THEM
ALL AT ONCE I IMAGINED I SAW SHOAL WATER AHEAD THE WAVE
OF COWARD AGONY THAT SURGED THROUGH ME THEN CAME NEAR DISLOCATING EVERY
JOINT IN ME
ALL MY CONFIDENCE IN THAT CROSSING VANISHED
I SEIZED THE
BELL ROPE DROPPED IT ASHAMED SEIZED IT AGAIN DROPPED IT ONCE MORE
CLUTCHED IT TREMBLINGLY ONE AGAIN AND PULLED IT SO FEEBLY THAT I COULD
HARDLY HEAR THE STROKE MYSELF
CAPTAIN AND MATE SANG OUT INSTANTLY AND
BOTH TOGETHER
'STARBOARD LEAD THERE AND QUICK ABOUT IT
THIS WAS ANOTHER SHOCK
I BEGAN TO CLIMB THE WHEEL LIKE A SQUIRREL
BUT I WOULD HARDLY GET THE BOAT STARTED TO PORT BEFORE I WOULD SEE NEW
DANGERS ON THAT SIDE AND AWAY I WOULD SPIN TO THE OTHER ONLY TO FIND
PERILS ACCUMULATING TO STARBOARD AND BE CRAZY TO GET TO PORT AGAIN
THEN CAME THE LEADSMAN'S SEPULCHRAL CRY
'D E E P FOUR
DEEP FOUR IN A BOTTOMLESS CROSSING THE TERROR OF IT TOOK MY BREATH
AWAY
'M A R K THREE
M A R K THREE
QUARTER LESS THREE
HALF TWAIN
THIS WAS FRIGHTFUL I SEIZED THE BELL ROPES AND STOPPED THE ENGINES
'QUARTER TWAIN QUARTER TWAIN MARK TWAIN
I WAS HELPLESS
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT IN THE WORLD TO DO
I WAS QUAKING
FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND I COULD HAVE HUNG MY HAT ON MY EYES THEY STUCK
OUT SO FAR
'QUARTER LESS TWAIN NINE AND A HALF
WE WERE DRAWING NINE MY HANDS WERE IN A NERVELESS FLUTTER
I COULD
NOT RING A BELL INTELLIGIBLY WITH THEM
I FLEW TO THE SPEAKING TUBE AND
SHOUTED TO THE ENGINEER
'OH BEN IF YOU LOVE ME BACK HER QUICK BEN OH BACK THE IMMORTAL
SOUL OUT OF HER
I HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE GENTLY
I LOOKED AROUND AND THERE STOOD MR
BIXBY SMILING A BLAND SWEET SMILE
THEN THE AUDIENCE ON THE HURRICANE
DECK SENT UP A THUNDERGUST OF HUMILIATING LAUGHTER
I SAW IT ALL NOW
AND I FELT MEANER THAN THE MEANEST MAN IN HUMAN HISTORY
I LAID IN THE
LEAD SET THE BOAT IN HER MARKS CAME AHEAD ON THE ENGINES AND SAID
'IT WAS A FINE TRICK TO PLAY ON AN ORPHAN WASN'T IT I SUPPOSE I'LL
NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF HOW I WAS ASS ENOUGH TO HEAVE THE LEAD AT THE
HEAD OF 66
'WELL NO YOU WON'T MAYBE
IN FACT I HOPE YOU WON'T FOR I WANT YOU
TO LEARN SOMETHING BY THAT EXPERIENCE
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO
BOTTOM IN THAT CROSSING
'YES SIR I DID
'VERY WELL THEN
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ALLOWED ME OR ANYBODY ELSE TO SHAKE
YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THAT KNOWLEDGE
TRY TO REMEMBER THAT
AND ANOTHER
THING WHEN YOU GET INTO A DANGEROUS PLACE DON'T TURN COWARD
THAT
ISN'T GOING TO HELP MATTERS ANY
IT WAS A GOOD ENOUGH LESSON BUT PRETTY HARDLY LEARNED
YET ABOUT THE
HARDEST PART OF IT WAS THAT FOR MONTHS I SO OFTEN HAD TO HEAR A PHRASE
WHICH I HAD CONCEIVED A PARTICULAR DISTASTE FOR
IT WAS 'OH BEN IF
YOU LOVE ME BACK HER
CHAPTER 14
RANK AND DIGNITY OF PILOTING
IN MY PRECEDING CHAPTERS I HAVE TRIED BY GOING INTO THE MINUTIAE OF THE
SCIENCE OF PILOTING TO CARRY THE READER STEP BY STEP TO A COMPREHENSION
OF WHAT THE SCIENCE CONSISTS OF AND AT THE SAME TIME I HAVE TRIED TO
SHOW HIM THAT IT IS A VERY CURIOUS AND WONDERFUL SCIENCE TOO AND VERY
WORTHY OF HIS ATTENTION
IF I HAVE SEEMED TO LOVE MY SUBJECT IT IS NO
SURPRISING THING FOR I LOVED THE PROFESSION FAR BETTER THAN ANY I HAVE
FOLLOWED SINCE AND I TOOK A MEASURELESS PRIDE IN IT
THE REASON IS
PLAIN A PILOT IN THOSE DAYS WAS THE ONLY UNFETTERED AND ENTIRELY
INDEPENDENT HUMAN BEING THAT LIVED IN THE EARTH
KINGS ARE BUT THE
HAMPERED SERVANTS OF PARLIAMENT AND PEOPLE PARLIAMENTS SIT IN CHAINS
FORGED BY THEIR CONSTITUENCY THE EDITOR OF A NEWSPAPER CANNOT BE
INDEPENDENT BUT MUST WORK WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND HIM BY PARTY AND
PATRONS AND BE CONTENT TO UTTER ONLY HALF OR TWO THIRDS OF HIS MIND NO
CLERGYMAN IS A FREE MAN AND MAY SPEAK THE WHOLE TRUTH REGARDLESS OF
HIS PARISH'S OPINIONS WRITERS OF ALL KINDS ARE MANACLED SERVANTS OF THE
PUBLIC
WE WRITE FRANKLY AND FEARLESSLY BUT THEN WE 'MODIFY' BEFORE WE
PRINT
IN TRUTH EVERY MAN AND WOMAN AND CHILD HAS A MASTER AND WORRIES
AND FRETS IN SERVITUDE BUT IN THE DAY I WRITE OF THE MISSISSIPPI PILOT
HAD NONE
THE CAPTAIN COULD STAND UPON THE HURRICANE DECK IN THE POMP
OF A VERY BRIEF AUTHORITY AND GIVE HIM FIVE OR SIX ORDERS WHILE THE
VESSEL BACKED INTO THE STREAM AND THEN THAT SKIPPER'S REIGN WAS OVER
THE MOMENT THAT THE BOAT WAS UNDER WAY IN THE RIVER SHE WAS UNDER THE
SOLE AND UNQUESTIONED CONTROL OF THE PILOT
HE COULD DO WITH HER EXACTLY
AS HE PLEASED RUN HER WHEN AND WHITHER HE CHOSE AND TIE HER UP TO THE
BANK WHENEVER HIS JUDGMENT SAID THAT THAT COURSE WAS BEST
HIS MOVEMENTS
WERE ENTIRELY FREE HE CONSULTED NO ONE HE RECEIVED COMMANDS FROM
NOBODY HE PROMPTLY RESENTED EVEN THE MEREST SUGGESTIONS
INDEED
THE LAW OF THE UNITED STATES FORBADE HIM TO LISTEN TO COMMANDS OR
SUGGESTIONS RIGHTLY CONSIDERING THAT THE PILOT NECESSARILY KNEW BETTER
HOW TO HANDLE THE BOAT THAN ANYBODY COULD TELL HIM
SO HERE WAS THE
NOVELTY OF A KING WITHOUT A KEEPER AN ABSOLUTE MONARCH WHO WAS ABSOLUTE
IN SOBER TRUTH AND NOT BY A FICTION OF WORDS
I HAVE SEEN A BOY OF
EIGHTEEN TAKING A GREAT STEAMER SERENELY INTO WHAT SEEMED ALMOST CERTAIN
DESTRUCTION AND THE AGED CAPTAIN STANDING MUTELY BY FILLED WITH
APPREHENSION BUT POWERLESS TO INTERFERE
HIS INTERFERENCE IN THAT
PARTICULAR INSTANCE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EXCELLENT THING BUT TO PERMIT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ESTABLISH A MOST PERNICIOUS PRECEDENT
IT WILL
EASILY BE GUESSED CONSIDERING THE PILOT'S BOUNDLESS AUTHORITY THAT HE
WAS A GREAT PERSONAGE IN THE OLD STEAMBOATING DAYS
HE WAS TREATED WITH
MARKED COURTESY BY THE CAPTAIN AND WITH MARKED DEFERENCE BY ALL
THE OFFICERS AND SERVANTS AND THIS DEFERENTIAL SPIRIT WAS QUICKLY
COMMUNICATED TO THE PASSENGERS TOO
I THINK PILOTS WERE ABOUT THE ONLY
PEOPLE I EVER KNEW WHO FAILED TO SHOW IN SOME DEGREE EMBARRASSMENT IN
THE PRESENCE OF TRAVELING FOREIGN PRINCES
BUT THEN PEOPLE IN ONE'S OWN
GRADE OF LIFE ARE NOT USUALLY EMBARRASSING OBJECTS
BY LONG HABIT PILOTS CAME TO PUT ALL THEIR WISHES IN THE FORM OF
COMMANDS
IT 'GRAVELS' ME TO THIS DAY TO PUT MY WILL IN THE WEAK SHAPE
OF A REQUEST INSTEAD OF LAUNCHING IT IN THE CRISP LANGUAGE OF AN ORDER
IN THOSE OLD DAYS TO LOAD A STEAMBOAT AT ST
LOUIS TAKE HER TO NEW
ORLEANS AND BACK AND DISCHARGE CARGO CONSUMED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE
DAYS ON AN AVERAGE
SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THESE DAYS THE BOAT SPENT AT THE
WHARVES OF ST
LOUIS AND NEW ORLEANS AND EVERY SOUL ON BOARD WAS HARD
AT WORK EXCEPT THE TWO PILOTS THEY DID NOTHING BUT PLAY GENTLEMAN UP
TOWN AND RECEIVE THE SAME WAGES FOR IT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON DUTY
THE
MOMENT THE BOAT TOUCHED THE WHARF AT EITHER CITY THEY WERE ASHORE AND
THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO BE SEEN AGAIN TILL THE LAST BELL WAS RINGING AND
EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR ANOTHER VOYAGE
WHEN A CAPTAIN GOT HOLD OF A PILOT OF PARTICULARLY HIGH REPUTATION HE
TOOK PAINS TO KEEP HIM
WHEN WAGES WERE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ON
THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI I HAVE KNOWN A CAPTAIN TO KEEP SUCH A PILOT IN
IDLENESS UNDER FULL PAY THREE MONTHS AT A TIME WHILE THE RIVER WAS
FROZEN UP
AND ONE MUST REMEMBER THAT IN THOSE CHEAP TIMES FOUR HUNDRED
DOLLARS WAS A SALARY OF ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE SPLENDOR
FEW MEN ON SHORE
GOT SUCH PAY AS THAT AND WHEN THEY DID THEY WERE MIGHTILY LOOKED UP
TO
WHEN PILOTS FROM EITHER END OF THE RIVER WANDERED INTO OUR SMALL
MISSOURI VILLAGE THEY WERE SOUGHT BY THE BEST AND THE FAIREST AND
TREATED WITH EXALTED RESPECT
LYING IN PORT UNDER WAGES WAS A THING
WHICH MANY PILOTS GREATLY ENJOYED AND APPRECIATED ESPECIALLY IF THEY
BELONGED IN THE MISSOURI RIVER IN THE HEYDAY OF THAT TRADE KANSAS
TIMES AND GOT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A TRIP WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO
ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH
HERE IS A CONVERSATION OF THAT
DAY
A CHAP OUT OF THE ILLINOIS RIVER WITH A LITTLE STERN WHEEL TUB
ACCOSTS A COUPLE OF ORNATE AND GILDED MISSOURI RIVER PILOTS
'GENTLEMEN I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD TRIP FOR THE UPCOUNTRY AND SHALL
WANT YOU ABOUT A MONTH
HOW MUCH WILL IT BE
'EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS APIECE
'HEAVENS AND EARTH YOU TAKE MY BOAT LET ME HAVE YOUR WAGES AND I'LL
DIVIDE
I WILL REMARK IN PASSING THAT MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOATMEN WERE IMPORTANT
IN LANDSMEN'S EYES AND IN THEIR OWN TOO IN A DEGREE ACCORDING TO THE
DIGNITY OF THE BOAT THEY WERE ON
FOR INSTANCE IT WAS A PROUD THING TO
BE OF THE CREW OF SUCH STATELY CRAFT AS THE 'ALECK SCOTT' OR THE 'GRAND
TURK NEGRO FIREMEN DECK HANDS AND BARBERS BELONGING TO THOSE BOATS
WERE DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGES IN THEIR GRADE OF LIFE AND THEY WERE WELL
AWARE OF THAT FACT TOO
A STALWART DARKEY ONCE GAVE OFFENSE AT A NEGRO
BALL IN NEW ORLEANS BY PUTTING ON A GOOD MANY AIRS
FINALLY ONE OF THE
MANAGERS BUSTLED UP TO HIM AND SAID
'WHO IS YOU ANY WAY WHO IS YOU DAT'S WHAT I WANTS TO KNOW
THE OFFENDER WAS NOT DISCONCERTED IN THE LEAST BUT SWELLED HIMSELF
UP AND THREW THAT INTO HIS VOICE WHICH SHOWED THAT HE KNEW HE WAS NOT
PUTTING ON ALL THOSE AIRS ON A STINTED CAPITAL
'WHO IS I WHO IS I I LET YOU KNOW MIGHTY QUICK WHO I IS I WANT
YOU NIGGERS TO UNDERSTAN' DAT I FIRES DE MIDDLE DO' FOOTNOTE DOOR ON
DE ALECK SCOTT
THAT WAS SUFFICIENT
THE BARBER OF THE 'GRAND TURK' WAS A SPRUCE YOUNG NEGRO WHO AIRED HIS
IMPORTANCE WITH BALMY COMPLACENCY AND WAS GREATLY COURTED BY THE CIRCLE
IN WHICH HE MOVED
THE YOUNG COLORED POPULATION OF NEW ORLEANS WERE MUCH
GIVEN TO FLIRTING AT TWILIGHT ON THE BANQUETTES OF THE BACK STREETS
SOMEBODY SAW AND HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THE FOLLOWING ONE EVENING IN
ONE OF THOSE LOCALITIES
A MIDDLE AGED NEGRO WOMAN PROJECTED HER HEAD
THROUGH A BROKEN PANE AND SHOUTED VERY WILLING THAT THE NEIGHBORS
SHOULD HEAR AND ENVY 'YOU MARY ANN COME IN DE HOUSE DIS MINUTE
STANNIN' OUT DAH FOOLIN' 'LONG WID DAT LOW TRASH AN' HEAH'S DE BARBER
OFFN DE GRAN' TURK WANTS TO CONWERSE WID YOU
MY REFERENCE A MOMENT AGO TO THE FACT THAT A PILOT'S PECULIAR OFFICIAL
POSITION PLACED HIM OUT OF THE REACH OF CRITICISM OR COMMAND BRINGS
STEPHEN W NATURALLY TO MY MIND
HE WAS A GIFTED PILOT A GOOD
FELLOW A TIRELESS TALKER AND HAD BOTH WIT AND HUMOR IN HIM
HE HAD A
MOST IRREVERENT INDEPENDENCE TOO AND WAS DELICIOUSLY EASY GOING AND
COMFORTABLE IN THE PRESENCE OF AGE OFFICIAL DIGNITY AND EVEN THE MOST
AUGUST WEALTH
HE ALWAYS HAD WORK HE NEVER SAVED A PENNY HE WAS A MOST
PERSUASIVE BORROWER HE WAS IN DEBT TO EVERY PILOT ON THE RIVER AND TO
THE MAJORITY OF THE CAPTAINS
HE COULD THROW A SORT OF SPLENDOR AROUND
A BIT OF HARUM SCARUM DEVIL MAY CARE PILOTING THAT MADE IT ALMOST
FASCINATING BUT NOT TO EVERYBODY
HE MADE A TRIP WITH GOOD OLD CAPTAIN
Y ONCE AND WAS 'RELIEVED' FROM DUTY WHEN THE BOAT GOT TO NEW
ORLEANS
SOMEBODY EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THE DISCHARGE
CAPTAIN Y
SHUDDERED AT THE MERE MENTION OF STEPHEN
THEN HIS POOR THIN OLD VOICE
PIPED OUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS
'WHY BLESS ME I WOULDN'T HAVE SUCH A WILD CREATURE ON MY BOAT FOR THE
WORLD NOT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD HE SWEARS HE SINGS HE WHISTLES HE
YELLS I NEVER SAW SUCH AN INJUN TO YELL
ALL TIMES OF THE NIGHT IT
NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HIM
HE WOULD JUST YELL THAT WAY NOT FOR
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR BUT MERELY ON ACCOUNT OF A KIND OF DEVILISH
COMFORT HE GOT OUT OF IT
I NEVER COULD GET INTO A SOUND SLEEP BUT
HE WOULD FETCH ME OUT OF BED ALL IN A COLD SWEAT WITH ONE OF THOSE
DREADFUL WAR WHOOPS
A QUEER BEING VERY QUEER BEING NO RESPECT FOR
ANYTHING OR ANYBODY
SOMETIMES HE CALLED ME JOHNNY AND HE KEPT A
FIDDLE AND A CAT
HE PLAYED EXECRABLY
THIS SEEMED TO DISTRESS THE CAT
AND SO THE CAT WOULD HOWL
NOBODY COULD SLEEP WHERE THAT MAN AND HIS
FAMILY WAS
AND RECKLESS
THERE NEVER WAS ANYTHING LIKE IT
NOW YOU MAY
BELIEVE IT OR NOT BUT AS SURE AS I AM SITTING HERE HE BROUGHT MY BOAT
A TILTING DOWN THROUGH THOSE AWFUL SNAGS AT CHICOT UNDER A RATTLING
HEAD OF STEAM AND THE WIND A BLOWING LIKE THE VERY NATION AT THAT MY
OFFICERS WILL TELL YOU SO
THEY SAW IT
AND SIR WHILE HE WAS A TEARING
RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THOSE SNAGS AND I A SHAKING IN MY SHOES AND PRAYING
I WISH I MAY NEVER SPEAK AGAIN IF HE DIDN'T PUCKER UP HIS MOUTH AND GO
TO WHISTLING YES SIR WHISTLING BUFFALO GALS CAN'T YOU COME OUT
TONIGHT CAN'T YOU COME OUT TO NIGHT CAN'T YOU COME OUT TO NIGHT AND
DOING IT AS CALMLY AS IF WE WERE ATTENDING A FUNERAL AND WEREN'T RELATED
TO THE CORPSE
AND WHEN I REMONSTRATED WITH HIM ABOUT IT HE SMILED DOWN
ON ME AS IF I WAS HIS CHILD AND TOLD ME TO RUN IN THE HOUSE AND TRY TO
BE GOOD AND NOT BE MEDDLING WITH MY SUPERIORS
ONCE A PRETTY MEAN CAPTAIN CAUGHT STEPHEN IN NEW ORLEANS OUT OF WORK
AND AS USUAL OUT OF MONEY
HE LAID STEADY SIEGE TO STEPHEN WHO WAS IN
A VERY 'CLOSE PLACE AND FINALLY PERSUADED HIM TO HIRE WITH HIM AT ONE
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH JUST HALF WAGES THE CAPTAIN
AGREEING NOT TO DIVULGE THE SECRET AND SO BRING DOWN THE CONTEMPT OF ALL
THE GUILD UPON THE POOR FELLOW
BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT MORE THAN A DAY OUT
OF NEW ORLEANS BEFORE STEPHEN DISCOVERED THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS BOASTING
OF HIS EXPLOIT AND THAT ALL THE OFFICERS HAD BEEN TOLD
STEPHEN WINCED
BUT SAID NOTHING
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON THE CAPTAIN STEPPED
OUT ON THE HURRICANE DECK CAST HIS EYE AROUND AND LOOKED A GOOD DEAL
SURPRISED
HE GLANCED INQUIRINGLY ALOFT AT STEPHEN BUT STEPHEN WAS
WHISTLING PLACIDLY AND ATTENDING TO BUSINESS
THE CAPTAIN STOOD AROUND
A WHILE IN EVIDENT DISCOMFORT AND ONCE OR TWICE SEEMED ABOUT TO MAKE A
SUGGESTION BUT THE ETIQUETTE OF THE RIVER TAUGHT HIM TO AVOID THAT SORT
OF RASHNESS AND SO HE MANAGED TO HOLD HIS PEACE
HE CHAFED AND PUZZLED
A FEW MINUTES LONGER THEN RETIRED TO HIS APARTMENTS
BUT SOON HE
WAS OUT AGAIN AND APPARENTLY MORE PERPLEXED THAN EVER
PRESENTLY HE
VENTURED TO REMARK WITH DEFERENCE
'PRETTY GOOD STAGE OF THE RIVER NOW AIN'T IT SIR
'WELL I SHOULD SAY SO BANK FULL IS A PRETTY LIBERAL STAGE
'SEEMS TO BE A GOOD DEAL OF CURRENT HERE
'GOOD DEAL DON'T DESCRIBE IT IT'S WORSE THAN A MILL RACE
'ISN'T IT EASIER IN TOWARD SHORE THAN IT IS OUT HERE IN THE MIDDLE
'YES I RECKON IT IS BUT A BODY CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL WITH A STEAMBOAT
IT'S PRETTY SAFE OUT HERE CAN'T STRIKE ANY BOTTOM HERE YOU CAN DEPEND
ON THAT
THE CAPTAIN DEPARTED LOOKING RUEFUL ENOUGH
AT THIS RATE HE WOULD
PROBABLY DIE OF OLD AGE BEFORE HIS BOAT GOT TO ST
LOUIS
NEXT DAY HE
APPEARED ON DECK AND AGAIN FOUND STEPHEN FAITHFULLY STANDING UP THE
MIDDLE OF THE RIVER FIGHTING THE WHOLE VAST FORCE OF THE MISSISSIPPI
AND WHISTLING THE SAME PLACID TUNE
THIS THING WAS BECOMING SERIOUS
IN BY THE SHORE WAS A SLOWER BOAT CLIPPING ALONG IN THE EASY WATER AND
GAINING STEADILY SHE BEGAN TO MAKE FOR AN ISLAND CHUTE STEPHEN STUCK
TO THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
SPEECH WAS WRUNG FROM THE CAPTAIN
HE
SAID
'MR
W DON'T THAT CHUTE CUT OFF A GOOD DEAL OF DISTANCE
'I THINK IT DOES BUT I DON'T KNOW
'DON'T KNOW WELL ISN'T THERE WATER ENOUGH IN IT NOW TO GO THROUGH
'I EXPECT THERE IS BUT I AM NOT CERTAIN
'UPON MY WORD THIS IS ODD WHY THOSE PILOTS ON THAT BOAT YONDER ARE
GOING TO TRY IT
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T KNOW AS MUCH AS THEY
DO
THEY WHY THEY ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR PILOTS BUT
DON'T YOU BE UNEASY I KNOW AS MUCH AS ANY MAN CAN AFFORD TO KNOW FOR A
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE
THE CAPTAIN SURRENDERED
FIVE MINUTES LATER STEPHEN WAS BOWLING THROUGH THE CHUTE AND SHOWING THE
RIVAL BOAT A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR PAIR OF HEELS
CHAPTER 15
THE PILOTS' MONOPOLY
ONE DAY ON BOARD THE 'ALECK SCOTT MY CHIEF MR
BIXBY WAS CRAWLING
CAREFULLY THROUGH A CLOSE PLACE AT CAT ISLAND BOTH LEADS GOING AND
EVERYBODY HOLDING HIS BREATH
THE CAPTAIN A NERVOUS APPREHENSIVE MAN
KEPT STILL AS LONG AS HE COULD BUT FINALLY BROKE DOWN AND SHOUTED FROM
THE HURRICANE DECK
'FOR GRACIOUS' SAKE GIVE HER STEAM MR
BIXBY GIVE HER STEAM SHE'LL
NEVER RAISE THE REEF ON THIS HEADWAY
FOR ALL THE EFFECT THAT WAS PRODUCED UPON MR
BIXBY ONE WOULD HAVE
SUPPOSED THAT NO REMARK HAD BEEN MADE
BUT FIVE MINUTES LATER WHEN
THE DANGER WAS PAST AND THE LEADS LAID IN HE BURST INSTANTLY INTO A
CONSUMING FURY AND GAVE THE CAPTAIN THE MOST ADMIRABLE CURSING I EVER
LISTENED TO
NO BLOODSHED ENSUED BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN'S
CAUSE WAS WEAK FOR ORDINARILY HE WAS NOT A MAN TO TAKE CORRECTION
QUIETLY
HAVING NOW SET FORTH IN DETAIL THE NATURE OF THE SCIENCE OF PILOTING
AND LIKEWISE DESCRIBED THE RANK WHICH THE PILOT HELD AMONG THE
FRATERNITY OF STEAMBOATMEN THIS SEEMS A FITTING PLACE TO SAY A FEW
WORDS ABOUT AN ORGANIZATION WHICH THE PILOTS ONCE FORMED FOR THE
PROTECTION OF THEIR GUILD
IT WAS CURIOUS AND NOTEWORTHY IN THIS
THAT IT WAS PERHAPS THE COMPACTEST THE COMPLETEST AND THE STRONGEST
COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION EVER FORMED AMONG MEN
FOR A LONG TIME WAGES HAD BEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH
BUT CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AS STEAMBOATS MULTIPLIED AND BUSINESS INCREASED
THE WAGES BEGAN TO FALL LITTLE BY LITTLE
IT WAS EASY TO DISCOVER THE
REASON OF THIS
TOO MANY PILOTS WERE BEING 'MADE IT WAS NICE TO HAVE
A 'CUB A STEERSMAN TO DO ALL THE HARD WORK FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS
GRATIS WHILE HIS MASTER SAT ON A HIGH BENCH AND SMOKED ALL PILOTS AND
CAPTAINS HAD SONS OR NEPHEWS WHO WANTED TO BE PILOTS
BY AND BY IT CAME
TO PASS THAT NEARLY EVERY PILOT ON THE RIVER HAD A STEERSMAN
WHEN A
STEERSMAN HAD MADE AN AMOUNT OF PROGRESS THAT WAS SATISFACTORY TO ANY
TWO PILOTS IN THE TRADE THEY COULD GET A PILOT'S LICENSE FOR HIM BY
SIGNING AN APPLICATION DIRECTED TO THE UNITED STATES INSPECTOR
NOTHING
FURTHER WAS NEEDED USUALLY NO QUESTIONS WERE ASKED NO PROOFS OF
CAPACITY REQUIRED
VERY WELL THIS GROWING SWARM OF NEW PILOTS PRESENTLY BEGAN TO UNDERMINE
THE WAGES IN ORDER TO GET BERTHS
TOO LATE APPARENTLY THE KNIGHTS OF
THE TILLER PERCEIVED THEIR MISTAKE
PLAINLY SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE
AND QUICKLY BUT WHAT WAS TO BE THE NEEDFUL THING
A CLOSE ORGANIZATION
NOTHING ELSE WOULD ANSWER
TO COMPASS THIS SEEMED AN IMPOSSIBILITY SO
IT WAS TALKED AND TALKED AND THEN DROPPED
IT WAS TOO LIKELY TO RUIN
WHOEVER VENTURED TO MOVE IN THE MATTER
BUT AT LAST ABOUT A DOZEN OF
THE BOLDEST AND SOME OF THEM THE BEST PILOTS ON THE RIVER LAUNCHED
THEMSELVES INTO THE ENTERPRISE AND TOOK ALL THE CHANCES
THEY GOT A
SPECIAL CHARTER FROM THE LEGISLATURE WITH LARGE POWERS UNDER THE NAME
OF THE PILOTS' BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION ELECTED THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETED
THEIR ORGANIZATION CONTRIBUTED CAPITAL PUT 'ASSOCIATION' WAGES UP TO
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AT ONCE AND THEN RETIRED TO THEIR HOMES
FOR THEY WERE PROMPTLY DISCHARGED FROM EMPLOYMENT
BUT THERE WERE TWO
OR THREE UNNOTICED TRIFLES IN THEIR BY LAWS WHICH HAD THE SEEDS OF
PROPAGATION IN THEM
FOR INSTANCE ALL IDLE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION
IN GOOD STANDING WERE ENTITLED TO A PENSION OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER
MONTH
THIS BEGAN TO BRING IN ONE STRAGGLER AFTER ANOTHER FROM THE RANKS
OF THE NEW FLEDGED PILOTS IN THE DULL SUMMER SEASON
BETTER HAVE
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS THAN STARVE THE INITIATION FEE WAS ONLY TWELVE
DOLLARS AND NO DUES REQUIRED FROM THE UNEMPLOYED
ALSO THE WIDOWS OF DECEASED MEMBERS IN GOOD STANDING COULD DRAW
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH AND A CERTAIN SUM FOR EACH OF THEIR
CHILDREN
ALSO THE SAID DECEASED WOULD BE BURIED AT THE ASSOCIATION'S
EXPENSE
THESE THINGS RESURRECTED ALL THE SUPERANNUATED AND FORGOTTEN
PILOTS IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
THEY CAME FROM FARMS THEY CAME FROM
INTERIOR VILLAGES THEY CAME FROM EVERYWHERE
THEY CAME ON CRUTCHES ON
DRAYS IN AMBULANCES ANY WAY SO THEY GOT THERE
THEY PAID IN THEIR
TWELVE DOLLARS AND STRAIGHTWAY BEGAN TO DRAW OUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A
MONTH AND CALCULATE THEIR BURIAL BILLS
BY AND BY ALL THE USELESS HELPLESS PILOTS AND A DOZEN FIRST CLASS
ONES WERE IN THE ASSOCIATION AND NINE TENTHS OF THE BEST PILOTS OUT
OF IT AND LAUGHING AT IT
IT WAS THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE WHOLE RIVER
EVERYBODY JOKED ABOUT THE BY LAW REQUIRING MEMBERS TO PAY TEN PER CENT
OF THEIR WAGES EVERY MONTH INTO THE TREASURY FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE
ASSOCIATION WHEREAS ALL THE MEMBERS WERE OUTCAST AND TABOOED AND
NO ONE WOULD EMPLOY THEM
EVERYBODY WAS DERISIVELY GRATEFUL TO THE
ASSOCIATION FOR TAKING ALL THE WORTHLESS PILOTS OUT OF THE WAY AND
LEAVING THE WHOLE FIELD TO THE EXCELLENT AND THE DESERVING AND
EVERYBODY WAS NOT ONLY JOCULARLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT BUT FOR A RESULT
WHICH NATURALLY FOLLOWED NAMELY THE GRADUAL ADVANCE OF WAGES AS THE
BUSY SEASON APPROACHED
WAGES HAD GONE UP FROM THE LOW FIGURE OF ONE
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE AND IN SOME
CASES TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND IT WAS GREAT FUN TO ENLARGE UPON THE
FACT THAT THIS CHARMING THING HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY A BODY OF MEN NOT
ONE OF WHOM RECEIVED A PARTICLE OF BENEFIT FROM IT
SOME OF THE JOKERS
USED TO CALL AT THE ASSOCIATION ROOMS AND HAVE A GOOD TIME CHAFFING THE
MEMBERS AND OFFERING THEM THE CHARITY OF TAKING THEM AS STEERSMEN FOR
A TRIP SO THAT THEY COULD SEE WHAT THE FORGOTTEN RIVER LOOKED LIKE
HOWEVER THE ASSOCIATION WAS CONTENT OR AT LEAST IT GAVE NO SIGN TO THE
CONTRARY
NOW AND THEN IT CAPTURED A PILOT WHO WAS 'OUT OF LUCK AND
ADDED HIM TO ITS LIST AND THESE LATER ADDITIONS WERE VERY VALUABLE
FOR THEY WERE GOOD PILOTS THE INCOMPETENT ONES HAD ALL BEEN ABSORBED
BEFORE
AS BUSINESS FRESHENED WAGES CLIMBED GRADUALLY UP TO TWO HUNDRED
AND FIFTY DOLLARS THE ASSOCIATION FIGURE AND BECAME FIRMLY FIXED
THERE AND STILL WITHOUT BENEFITING A MEMBER OF THAT BODY FOR NO MEMBER
WAS HIRED
THE HILARITY AT THE ASSOCIATION'S EXPENSE BURST ALL BOUNDS
NOW
THERE WAS NO END TO THE FUN WHICH THAT POOR MARTYR HAD TO PUT UP
WITH
HOWEVER IT IS A LONG LANE THAT HAS NO TURNING
WINTER APPROACHED
BUSINESS DOUBLED AND TREBLED AND AN AVALANCHE OF MISSOURI ILLINOIS AND
UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BOATS CAME POURING DOWN TO TAKE A CHANCE IN THE
NEW ORLEANS TRADE
ALL OF A SUDDEN PILOTS WERE IN GREAT DEMAND AND WERE
CORRESPONDINGLY SCARCE
THE TIME FOR REVENGE WAS COME
IT WAS A BITTER
PILL TO HAVE TO ACCEPT ASSOCIATION PILOTS AT LAST YET CAPTAINS AND
OWNERS AGREED THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY
BUT NONE OF THESE OUTCASTS
OFFERED SO THERE WAS A STILL BITTERER PILL TO BE SWALLOWED THEY MUST
BE SOUGHT OUT AND ASKED FOR THEIR SERVICES
CAPTAIN WAS THE FIRST
MAN WHO FOUND IT NECESSARY TO TAKE THE DOSE AND HE HAD BEEN THE
LOUDEST DERIDER OF THE ORGANIZATION
HE HUNTED UP ONE OF THE BEST OF THE
ASSOCIATION PILOTS AND SAID
'WELL YOU BOYS HAVE RATHER GOT THE BEST OF US FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO
I'LL GIVE IN WITH AS GOOD A GRACE AS I CAN
I'VE COME TO HIRE YOU GET
YOUR TRUNK ABOARD RIGHT AWAY
I WANT TO LEAVE AT TWELVE O'CLOCK
'I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
WHO IS YOUR OTHER PILOT
'I'VE GOT I
S
WHY
'I CAN'T GO WITH HIM
HE DON'T BELONG TO THE ASSOCIATION
'WHAT
'IT'S SO
'DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT YOU WON'T TURN A WHEEL WITH ONE OF THE
VERY BEST AND OLDEST PILOTS ON THE RIVER BECAUSE HE DON'T BELONG TO YOUR
ASSOCIATION
'YES I DO
'WELL IF THIS ISN'T PUTTING ON AIRS I SUPPOSED I WAS DOING YOU A
BENEVOLENCE BUT I BEGIN TO THINK THAT I AM THE PARTY THAT WANTS A FAVOR
DONE
ARE YOU ACTING UNDER A LAW OF THE CONCERN
'YES
'SHOW IT TO ME
SO THEY STEPPED INTO THE ASSOCIATION ROOMS AND THE SECRETARY SOON
SATISFIED THE CAPTAIN WHO SAID
'WELL WHAT AM I TO DO I HAVE HIRED MR
S FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON
'I WILL PROVIDE FOR YOU SAID THE SECRETARY
'I WILL DETAIL A PILOT TO
GO WITH YOU AND HE SHALL BE ON BOARD AT TWELVE O'CLOCK
'BUT IF I DISCHARGE S HE WILL COME ON ME FOR THE WHOLE SEASON'S
WAGES
'OF COURSE THAT IS A MATTER BETWEEN YOU AND MR
S CAPTAIN
WE
CANNOT MEDDLE IN YOUR PRIVATE AFFAIRS
THE CAPTAIN STORMED BUT TO NO PURPOSE
IN THE END HE HAD TO DISCHARGE
S PAY HIM ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TAKE AN ASSOCIATION PILOT
IN HIS PLACE
THE LAUGH WAS BEGINNING TO TURN THE OTHER WAY NOW
EVERY
DAY THENCEFORWARD A NEW VICTIM FELL EVERY DAY SOME OUTRAGED CAPTAIN
DISCHARGED A NON ASSOCIATION PET WITH TEARS AND PROFANITY AND
INSTALLED A HATED ASSOCIATION MAN IN HIS BERTH
IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE
IDLE NON ASSOCIATIONISTS BEGAN TO BE PRETTY PLENTY BRISK AS BUSINESS
WAS AND MUCH AS THEIR SERVICES WERE DESIRED
THE LAUGH WAS SHIFTING TO
THE OTHER SIDE OF THEIR MOUTHS MOST PALPABLY
THESE VICTIMS TOGETHER
WITH THE CAPTAINS AND OWNERS PRESENTLY CEASED TO LAUGH ALTOGETHER
AND BEGAN TO RAGE ABOUT THE REVENGE THEY WOULD TAKE WHEN THE PASSING
BUSINESS 'SPURT' WAS OVER
SOON ALL THE LAUGHERS THAT WERE LEFT WERE THE OWNERS AND CREWS OF BOATS
THAT HAD TWO NON ASSOCIATION PILOTS
BUT THEIR TRIUMPH WAS NOT VERY
LONG LIVED
FOR THIS REASON IT WAS A RIGID RULE OF THE ASSOCIATION
THAT ITS MEMBERS SHOULD NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHATEVER GIVE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CHANNEL TO ANY 'OUTSIDER BY THIS TIME ABOUT HALF
THE BOATS HAD NONE BUT ASSOCIATION PILOTS AND THE OTHER HALF HAD NONE
BUT OUTSIDERS
AT THE FIRST GLANCE ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT WHEN IT CAME
TO FORBIDDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE RIVER THESE TWO PARTIES COULD PLAY
EQUALLY AT THAT GAME BUT THIS WAS NOT SO
AT EVERY GOOD SIZED TOWN FROM
ONE END OF THE RIVER TO THE OTHER THERE WAS A 'WHARF BOAT' TO LAND
AT INSTEAD OF A WHARF OR A PIER
FREIGHT WAS STORED IN IT FOR
TRANSPORTATION WAITING PASSENGERS SLEPT IN ITS CABINS
UPON EACH
OF THESE WHARF BOATS THE ASSOCIATION'S OFFICERS PLACED A STRONG BOX
FASTENED WITH A PECULIAR LOCK WHICH WAS USED IN NO OTHER SERVICE BUT
ONE THE UNITED STATES MAIL SERVICE
IT WAS THE LETTER BAG LOCK A
SACRED GOVERNMENTAL THING
BY DINT OF MUCH BESEECHING THE GOVERNMENT
HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO ALLOW THE ASSOCIATION TO USE THIS LOCK
EVERY
ASSOCIATION MAN CARRIED A KEY WHICH WOULD OPEN THESE BOXES
THAT KEY OR
RATHER A PECULIAR WAY OF HOLDING IT IN THE HAND WHEN ITS OWNER WAS ASKED
FOR RIVER INFORMATION BY A STRANGER FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ST
LOUIS
AND NEW ORLEANS ASSOCIATION HAD NOW BRED TOLERABLY THRIVING BRANCHES IN
A DOZEN NEIGHBORING STEAMBOAT TRADES WAS THE ASSOCIATION MAN'S SIGN AND
DIPLOMA OF MEMBERSHIP AND IF THE STRANGER DID NOT RESPOND BY PRODUCING
A SIMILAR KEY AND HOLDING IT IN A CERTAIN MANNER DULY PRESCRIBED HIS
QUESTION WAS POLITELY IGNORED
FROM THE ASSOCIATION'S SECRETARY EACH MEMBER RECEIVED A PACKAGE OF MORE
OR LESS GORGEOUS BLANKS PRINTED LIKE A BILLHEAD ON HANDSOME PAPER
PROPERLY RULED IN COLUMNS A BILL HEAD WORDED SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THESE BLANKS WERE FILLED UP DAY BY DAY AS THE VOYAGE PROGRESSED AND
DEPOSITED IN THE SEVERAL WHARF BOAT BOXES
FOR INSTANCE AS SOON AS THE
FIRST CROSSING OUT FROM ST
LOUIS WAS COMPLETED THE ITEMS WOULD BE
ENTERED UPON THE BLANK UNDER THE APPROPRIATE HEADINGS THUS
'ST
LOUIS
NINE AND A HALF FEET
STERN ON COURT HOUSE HEAD ON DEAD
COTTONWOOD ABOVE WOOD YARD UNTIL YOU RAISE THE FIRST REEF THEN PULL UP
SQUARE THEN UNDER HEAD OF REMARKS 'GO JUST OUTSIDE THE WRECKS THIS
IS IMPORTANT
NEW SNAG JUST WHERE YOU STRAIGHTEN DOWN GO ABOVE IT
THE PILOT WHO DEPOSITED THAT BLANK IN THE CAIRO BOX AFTER ADDING TO IT
THE DETAILS OF EVERY CROSSING ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM ST
LOUIS TOOK
OUT AND READ HALF A DOZEN FRESH REPORTS FROM UPWARD BOUND STEAMERS
CONCERNING THE RIVER BETWEEN CAIRO AND MEMPHIS POSTED HIMSELF
THOROUGHLY RETURNED THEM TO THE BOX AND WENT BACK ABOARD HIS BOAT
AGAIN SO ARMED AGAINST ACCIDENT THAT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY GET HIS BOAT
INTO TROUBLE WITHOUT BRINGING THE MOST INGENIOUS CARELESSNESS TO HIS
AID
IMAGINE THE BENEFITS OF SO ADMIRABLE A SYSTEM IN A PIECE OF RIVER TWELVE
OR THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILES LONG WHOSE CHANNEL WAS SHIFTING EVERY DAY
THE PILOT WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH SEEING A SHOAL
PLACE ONCE OR POSSIBLY TWICE A MONTH HAD A HUNDRED SHARP EYES TO WATCH
IT FOR HIM NOW AND BUSHELS OF INTELLIGENT BRAINS TO TELL HIM HOW TO
RUN IT
HIS INFORMATION ABOUT IT WAS SELDOM TWENTY FOUR HOURS OLD
IF
THE REPORTS IN THE LAST BOX CHANCED TO LEAVE ANY MISGIVINGS ON HIS
MIND CONCERNING A TREACHEROUS CROSSING HE HAD HIS REMEDY HE BLEW HIS
STEAM WHISTLE IN A PECULIAR WAY AS SOON AS HE SAW A BOAT APPROACHING
THE SIGNAL WAS ANSWERED IN A PECULIAR WAY IF THAT BOAT'S PILOTS WERE
ASSOCIATION MEN AND THEN THE TWO STEAMERS RANGED ALONGSIDE AND ALL
UNCERTAINTIES WERE SWEPT AWAY BY FRESH INFORMATION FURNISHED TO THE
INQUIRER BY WORD OF MOUTH AND IN MINUTE DETAIL
THE FIRST THING A PILOT DID WHEN HE REACHED NEW ORLEANS OR ST
LOUIS WAS
TO TAKE HIS FINAL AND ELABORATE REPORT TO THE ASSOCIATION PARLORS AND
HANG IT UP THERE AFTER WHICH HE WAS FREE TO VISIT HIS FAMILY
IN THESE
PARLORS A CROWD WAS ALWAYS GATHERED TOGETHER DISCUSSING CHANGES IN THE
CHANNEL AND THE MOMENT THERE WAS A FRESH ARRIVAL EVERYBODY STOPPED
TALKING TILL THIS WITNESS HAD TOLD THE NEWEST NEWS AND SETTLED THE
LATEST UNCERTAINTY
OTHER CRAFTSMEN CAN 'SINK THE SHOP SOMETIMES
AND INTEREST THEMSELVES IN OTHER MATTERS
NOT SO WITH A PILOT HE MUST
DEVOTE HIMSELF WHOLLY TO HIS PROFESSION AND TALK OF NOTHING ELSE FOR IT
WOULD BE SMALL GAIN TO BE PERFECT ONE DAY AND IMPERFECT THE NEXT
HE HAS
NO TIME OR WORDS TO WASTE IF HE WOULD KEEP 'POSTED
BUT THE OUTSIDERS HAD A HARD TIME OF IT
NO PARTICULAR PLACE TO MEET
AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION NO WHARF BOAT REPORTS NONE BUT CHANCE AND
UNSATISFACTORY WAYS OF GETTING NEWS
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT A MAN
SOMETIMES HAD TO RUN FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF RIVER ON INFORMATION THAT
WAS A WEEK OR TEN DAYS OLD
AT A FAIR STAGE OF THE RIVER THAT MIGHT HAVE
ANSWERED BUT WHEN THE DEAD LOW WATER CAME IT WAS DESTRUCTIVE
NOW CAME ANOTHER PERFECTLY LOGICAL RESULT
THE OUTSIDERS BEGAN TO
GROUND STEAMBOATS SINK THEM AND GET INTO ALL SORTS OF TROUBLE
WHEREAS ACCIDENTS SEEMED TO KEEP ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE ASSOCIATION MEN
WHEREFORE EVEN THE OWNERS AND CAPTAINS OF BOATS FURNISHED EXCLUSIVELY
WITH OUTSIDERS AND PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED TO BE WHOLLY INDEPENDENT OF
THE ASSOCIATION AND FREE TO COMFORT THEMSELVES WITH BRAG AND LAUGHTER
BEGAN TO FEEL PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE
STILL THEY MADE A SHOW OF KEEPING
UP THE BRAG UNTIL ONE BLACK DAY WHEN EVERY CAPTAIN OF THE LOT WAS
FORMALLY ORDERED TO IMMEDIATELY DISCHARGE HIS OUTSIDERS AND TAKE
ASSOCIATION PILOTS IN THEIR STEAD
AND WHO WAS IT THAT HAD THE DASHING
PRESUMPTION TO DO THAT ALAS IT CAME FROM A POWER BEHIND THE THRONE
THAT WAS GREATER THAN THE THRONE ITSELF
IT WAS THE UNDERWRITERS
IT WAS NO TIME TO 'SWAP KNIVES EVERY OUTSIDER HAD TO TAKE HIS TRUNK
ASHORE AT ONCE
OF COURSE IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT THERE WAS COLLUSION
BETWEEN THE ASSOCIATION AND THE UNDERWRITERS BUT THIS WAS NOT SO
THE
LATTER HAD COME TO COMPREHEND THE EXCELLENCE OF THE 'REPORT' SYSTEM OF
THE ASSOCIATION AND THE SAFETY IT SECURED AND SO THEY HAD MADE THEIR
DECISION AMONG THEMSELVES AND UPON PLAIN BUSINESS PRINCIPLES
THERE WAS WEEPING AND WAILING AND GNASHING OF TEETH IN THE CAMP OF
THE OUTSIDERS NOW
BUT NO MATTER THERE WAS BUT ONE COURSE FOR THEM TO
PURSUE AND THEY PURSUED IT
THEY CAME FORWARD IN COUPLES AND GROUPS
AND PROFFERED THEIR TWELVE DOLLARS AND ASKED FOR MEMBERSHIP
THEY WERE
SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT SEVERAL NEW BY LAWS HAD BEEN LONG AGO ADDED
FOR
INSTANCE THE INITIATION FEE HAD BEEN RAISED TO FIFTY DOLLARS THAT
SUM MUST BE TENDERED AND ALSO TEN PER CENT
OF THE WAGES WHICH THE
APPLICANT HAD RECEIVED EACH AND EVERY MONTH SINCE THE FOUNDING OF
THE ASSOCIATION
IN MANY CASES THIS AMOUNTED TO THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED
DOLLARS
STILL THE ASSOCIATION WOULD NOT ENTERTAIN THE APPLICATION
UNTIL THE MONEY WAS PRESENT
EVEN THEN A SINGLE ADVERSE VOTE KILLED THE
APPLICATION
EVERY MEMBER HAD TO VOTE 'YES' OR 'NO' IN PERSON AND BEFORE
WITNESSES SO IT TOOK WEEKS TO DECIDE A CANDIDACY BECAUSE MANY PILOTS
WERE SO LONG ABSENT ON VOYAGES
HOWEVER THE REPENTANT SINNERS SCRAPED
THEIR SAVINGS TOGETHER AND ONE BY ONE BY OUR TEDIOUS VOTING PROCESS
THEY WERE ADDED TO THE FOLD
A TIME CAME AT LAST WHEN ONLY ABOUT TEN
REMAINED OUTSIDE
THEY SAID THEY WOULD STARVE BEFORE THEY WOULD APPLY
THEY REMAINED IDLE A LONG WHILE BECAUSE OF COURSE NOBODY COULD VENTURE
TO EMPLOY THEM
BY AND BY THE ASSOCIATION PUBLISHED THE FACT THAT UPON A CERTAIN DATE
THE WAGES WOULD BE RAISED TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH
ALL THE
BRANCH ASSOCIATIONS HAD GROWN STRONG NOW AND THE RED RIVER ONE HAD
ADVANCED WAGES TO SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH
RELUCTANTLY THE TEN
OUTSIDERS YIELDED IN VIEW OF THESE THINGS AND MADE APPLICATION
THERE
WAS ANOTHER NEW BY LAW BY THIS TIME WHICH REQUIRED THEM TO PAY DUES
NOT ONLY ON ALL THE WAGES THEY HAD RECEIVED SINCE THE ASSOCIATION WAS
BORN BUT ALSO ON WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IF THEY HAD CONTINUED AT
WORK UP TO THE TIME OF THEIR APPLICATION INSTEAD OF GOING OFF TO POUT
IN IDLENESS
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A DIFFICULT MATTER TO ELECT THEM BUT
IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT LAST
THE MOST VIRULENT SINNER OF THIS BATCH HAD
STAYED OUT AND ALLOWED 'DUES' TO ACCUMULATE AGAINST HIM SO LONG THAT HE
HAD TO SEND IN SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS WITH HIS APPLICATION
THE ASSOCIATION HAD A GOOD BANK ACCOUNT NOW AND WAS VERY STRONG
THERE
WAS NO LONGER AN OUTSIDER
A BY LAW WAS ADDED FORBIDDING THE RECEPTION
OF ANY MORE CUBS OR APPRENTICES FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER WHICH TIME
A LIMITED NUMBER WOULD BE TAKEN NOT BY INDIVIDUALS BUT BY THE
ASSOCIATION UPON THESE TERMS THE APPLICANT MUST NOT BE LESS THAN
EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND OF RESPECTABLE FAMILY AND GOOD CHARACTER HE
MUST PASS AN EXAMINATION AS TO EDUCATION PAY A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN
ADVANCE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BECOMING AN APPRENTICE AND MUST REMAIN
UNDER THE COMMANDS OF THE ASSOCIATION UNTIL A GREAT PART OF THE
MEMBERSHIP MORE THAN HALF I THINK SHOULD BE WILLING TO SIGN HIS
APPLICATION FOR A PILOT'S LICENSE
ALL PREVIOUSLY ARTICLED APPRENTICES WERE NOW TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR
MASTERS AND ADOPTED BY THE ASSOCIATION
THE PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY
DETAILED THEM FOR SERVICE ON ONE BOAT OR ANOTHER AS THEY CHOSE AND
CHANGED THEM FROM BOAT TO BOAT ACCORDING TO CERTAIN RULES
IF A PILOT
COULD SHOW THAT HE WAS IN INFIRM HEALTH AND NEEDED ASSISTANCE ONE OF
THE CUBS WOULD BE ORDERED TO GO WITH HIM
THE WIDOW AND ORPHAN LIST GREW BUT SO DID THE ASSOCIATION'S FINANCIAL
RESOURCES
THE ASSOCIATION ATTENDED ITS OWN FUNERALS IN STATE AND PAID
FOR THEM
WHEN OCCASION DEMANDED IT SENT MEMBERS DOWN THE RIVER UPON
SEARCHES FOR THE BODIES OF BRETHREN LOST BY STEAMBOAT ACCIDENTS A
SEARCH OF THIS KIND SOMETIMES COST A THOUSAND DOLLARS
THE ASSOCIATION PROCURED A CHARTER AND WENT INTO THE INSURANCE BUSINESS
ALSO
IT NOT ONLY INSURED THE LIVES OF ITS MEMBERS BUT TOOK RISKS ON
STEAMBOATS
THE ORGANIZATION SEEMED INDESTRUCTIBLE
IT WAS THE TIGHTEST MONOPOLY IN
THE WORLD
BY THE UNITED STATES LAW NO MAN COULD BECOME A PILOT UNLESS
TWO DULY LICENSED PILOTS SIGNED HIS APPLICATION AND NOW THERE WAS
NOBODY OUTSIDE OF THE ASSOCIATION COMPETENT TO SIGN
CONSEQUENTLY THE
MAKING OF PILOTS WAS AT AN END
EVERY YEAR SOME WOULD DIE AND OTHERS
BECOME INCAPACITATED BY AGE AND INFIRMITY THERE WOULD BE NO NEW ONES
TO TAKE THEIR PLACES
IN TIME THE ASSOCIATION COULD PUT WAGES UP TO ANY
FIGURE IT CHOSE AND AS LONG AS IT SHOULD BE WISE ENOUGH NOT TO CARRY
THE THING TOO FAR AND PROVOKE THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT INTO AMENDING THE
LICENSING SYSTEM STEAMBOAT OWNERS WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT SINCE THERE
WOULD BE NO HELP FOR IT
THE OWNERS AND CAPTAINS WERE THE ONLY OBSTRUCTION THAT LAY BETWEEN
THE ASSOCIATION AND ABSOLUTE POWER AND AT LAST THIS ONE WAS REMOVED
INCREDIBLE AS IT MAY SEEM THE OWNERS AND CAPTAINS DELIBERATELY DID IT
THEMSELVES
WHEN THE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION ANNOUNCED MONTHS BEFOREHAND
THAT ON THE FIRST DAY OF SEPTEMBER 1861 WAGES WOULD BE ADVANCED TO
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH THE OWNERS AND CAPTAINS INSTANTLY PUT
FREIGHTS UP A FEW CENTS AND EXPLAINED TO THE FARMERS ALONG THE RIVER
THE NECESSITY OF IT BY CALLING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE BURDENSOME RATE
OF WAGES ABOUT TO BE ESTABLISHED
IT WAS A RATHER SLENDER ARGUMENT BUT
THE FARMERS DID NOT SEEM TO DETECT IT
IT LOOKED REASONABLE TO THEM THAT
TO ADD FIVE CENTS FREIGHT ON A BUSHEL OF CORN WAS JUSTIFIABLE UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OVERLOOKING THE FACT THAT THIS ADVANCE ON A CARGO OF
FORTY THOUSAND SACKS WAS A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN NECESSARY TO COVER THE
NEW WAGES
SO STRAIGHTWAY THE CAPTAINS AND OWNERS GOT UP AN ASSOCIATION OF THEIR
OWN AND PROPOSED TO PUT CAPTAINS' WAGES UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
TOO AND MOVE FOR ANOTHER ADVANCE IN FREIGHTS
IT WAS A NOVEL IDEA
BUT OF COURSE AN EFFECT WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED ONCE COULD BE PRODUCED
AGAIN
THE NEW ASSOCIATION DECREED FOR THIS WAS BEFORE ALL THE
OUTSIDERS HAD BEEN TAKEN INTO THE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION THAT IF ANY
CAPTAIN EMPLOYED A NON ASSOCIATION PILOT HE SHOULD BE FORCED TO
DISCHARGE HIM AND ALSO PAY A FINE OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
SEVERAL
OF THESE HEAVY FINES WERE PAID BEFORE THE CAPTAINS' ORGANIZATION GREW
STRONG ENOUGH TO EXERCISE FULL AUTHORITY OVER ITS MEMBERSHIP BUT THAT
ALL CEASED PRESENTLY
THE CAPTAINS TRIED TO GET THE PILOTS TO DECREE
THAT NO MEMBER OF THEIR CORPORATION SHOULD SERVE UNDER A NON ASSOCIATION
CAPTAIN BUT THIS PROPOSITION WAS DECLINED
THE PILOTS SAW THAT THEY
WOULD BE BACKED UP BY THE CAPTAINS AND THE UNDERWRITERS ANYHOW AND SO
THEY WISELY REFRAINED FROM ENTERING INTO ENTANGLING ALLIANCES
AS I HAVE REMARKED THE PILOTS' ASSOCIATION WAS NOW THE COMPACTEST
MONOPOLY IN THE WORLD PERHAPS AND SEEMED SIMPLY INDESTRUCTIBLE
AND YET THE DAYS OF ITS GLORY WERE NUMBERED
FIRST THE NEW RAILROAD
STRETCHING UP THROUGH MISSISSIPPI TENNESSEE AND KENTUCKY TO NORTHERN
RAILWAY CENTERS BEGAN TO DIVERT THE PASSENGER TRAVEL FROM THE STEAMERS
NEXT THE WAR CAME AND ALMOST ENTIRELY ANNIHILATED THE STEAMBOATING
INDUSTRY DURING SEVERAL YEARS LEAVING MOST OF THE PILOTS IDLE AND THE
COST OF LIVING ADVANCING ALL THE TIME THEN THE TREASURER OF THE ST
LOUIS ASSOCIATION PUT HIS HAND INTO THE TILL AND WALKED OFF WITH
EVERY DOLLAR OF THE AMPLE FUND AND FINALLY THE RAILROADS INTRUDING
EVERYWHERE THERE WAS LITTLE FOR STEAMERS TO DO WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER
BUT CARRY FREIGHTS SO STRAIGHTWAY SOME GENIUS FROM THE ATLANTIC COAST
INTRODUCED THE PLAN OF TOWING A DOZEN STEAMER CARGOES DOWN TO NEW
ORLEANS AT THE TAIL OF A VULGAR LITTLE TUG BOAT AND BEHOLD IN THE
TWINKLING OF AN EYE AS IT WERE THE ASSOCIATION AND THE NOBLE SCIENCE
OF PILOTING WERE THINGS OF THE DEAD AND PATHETIC PAST
CHAPTER 16
RACING DAYS
IT WAS ALWAYS THE CUSTOM FOR THE BOATS TO LEAVE NEW ORLEANS BETWEEN FOUR
AND FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
FROM THREE O'CLOCK ONWARD THEY WOULD
BE BURNING ROSIN AND PITCH PINE THE SIGN OF PREPARATION AND SO ONE
HAD THE PICTURESQUE SPECTACLE OF A RANK SOME TWO OR THREE MILES LONG
OF TALL ASCENDING COLUMNS OF COAL BLACK SMOKE A COLONNADE WHICH
SUPPORTED A SABLE ROOF OF THE SAME SMOKE BLENDED TOGETHER AND SPREADING
ABROAD OVER THE CITY
EVERY OUTWARD BOUND BOAT HAD ITS FLAG FLYING AT
THE JACK STAFF AND SOMETIMES A DUPLICATE ON THE VERGE STAFF ASTERN
TWO OR THREE MILES OF MATES WERE COMMANDING AND SWEARING WITH MORE THAN
USUAL EMPHASIS COUNTLESS PROCESSIONS OF FREIGHT BARRELS AND BOXES WERE
SPINNING ATHWART THE LEVEE AND FLYING ABOARD THE STAGE PLANKS BELATED
PASSENGERS WERE DODGING AND SKIPPING AMONG THESE FRANTIC THINGS HOPING
TO REACH THE FORECASTLE COMPANION WAY ALIVE BUT HAVING THEIR DOUBTS
ABOUT IT WOMEN WITH RETICULES AND BANDBOXES WERE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH
HUSBANDS FREIGHTED WITH CARPET SACKS AND CRYING BABIES AND MAKING A
FAILURE OF IT BY LOSING THEIR HEADS IN THE WHIRL AND ROAR AND GENERAL
DISTRACTION DRAYS AND BAGGAGE VANS WERE CLATTERING HITHER AND THITHER
IN A WILD HURRY EVERY NOW AND THEN GETTING BLOCKED AND JAMMED TOGETHER
AND THEN DURING TEN SECONDS ONE COULD NOT SEE THEM FOR THE PROFANITY
EXCEPT VAGUELY AND DIMLY EVERY WINDLASS CONNECTED WITH EVERY FOREHATCH
FROM ONE END OF THAT LONG ARRAY OF STEAMBOATS TO THE OTHER WAS KEEPING
UP A DEAFENING WHIZ AND WHIR LOWERING FREIGHT INTO THE HOLD AND THE
HALF NAKED CREWS OF PERSPIRING NEGROES THAT WORKED THEM WERE ROARING
SUCH SONGS AS 'DE LAS' SACK DE LAS' SACK INSPIRED TO UNIMAGINABLE
EXALTATION BY THE CHAOS OF TURMOIL AND RACKET THAT WAS DRIVING EVERYBODY
ELSE MAD
BY THIS TIME THE HURRICANE AND BOILER DECKS OF THE STEAMERS WOULD BE
PACKED AND BLACK WITH PASSENGERS
THE 'LAST BELLS' WOULD BEGIN TO CLANG
ALL DOWN THE LINE AND THEN THE POWWOW SEEMED TO DOUBLE IN A MOMENT OR
TWO THE FINAL WARNING CAME A SIMULTANEOUS DIN OF CHINESE GONGS WITH
THE CRY 'ALL DAT AIN'T GOIN' PLEASE TO GIT ASHO' AND BEHOLD THE
POWWOW QUADRUPLED PEOPLE CAME SWARMING ASHORE OVERTURNING EXCITED
STRAGGLERS THAT WERE TRYING TO SWARM ABOARD
ONE MORE MOMENT LATER A
LONG ARRAY OF STAGE PLANKS WAS BEING HAULED IN EACH WITH ITS CUSTOMARY
LATEST PASSENGER CLINGING TO THE END OF IT WITH TEETH NAILS AND
EVERYTHING ELSE AND THE CUSTOMARY LATEST PROCRASTINATOR MAKING A WILD
SPRING SHOREWARD OVER HIS HEAD
NOW A NUMBER OF THE BOATS SLIDE BACKWARD INTO THE STREAM LEAVING WIDE
GAPS IN THE SERRIED RANK OF STEAMERS
CITIZENS CROWD THE DECKS OF BOATS
THAT ARE NOT TO GO IN ORDER TO SEE THE SIGHT
STEAMER AFTER STEAMER
STRAIGHTENS HERSELF UP GATHERS ALL HER STRENGTH AND PRESENTLY COMES
SWINGING BY UNDER A TREMENDOUS HEAD OF STEAM WITH FLAG FLYING BLACK
SMOKE ROLLING AND HER ENTIRE CREW OF FIREMEN AND DECK HANDS USUALLY
SWARTHY NEGROES MASSED TOGETHER ON THE FORECASTLE THE BEST 'VOICE' IN
THE LOT TOWERING FROM THE MIDST BEING MOUNTED ON THE CAPSTAN WAVING
HIS HAT OR A FLAG AND ALL ROARING A MIGHTY CHORUS WHILE THE PARTING
CANNONS BOOM AND THE MULTITUDINOUS SPECTATORS SWING THEIR HATS AND
HUZZA STEAMER AFTER STEAMER FALLS INTO LINE AND THE STATELY PROCESSION
GOES WINGING ITS FLIGHT UP THE RIVER
IN THE OLD TIMES WHENEVER TWO FAST BOATS STARTED OUT ON A RACE WITH A
BIG CROWD OF PEOPLE LOOKING ON IT WAS INSPIRING TO HEAR THE CREWS SING
ESPECIALLY IF THE TIME WERE NIGHT FALL AND THE FORECASTLE LIT UP WITH
THE RED GLARE OF THE TORCH BASKETS
RACING WAS ROYAL FUN
THE PUBLIC
ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA THAT RACING WAS DANGEROUS WHEREAS THE OPPOSITE WAS
THE CASE THAT IS AFTER THE LAWS WERE PASSED WHICH RESTRICTED EACH BOAT
TO JUST SO MANY POUNDS OF STEAM TO THE SQUARE INCH
NO ENGINEER WAS EVER
SLEEPY OR CARELESS WHEN HIS HEART WAS IN A RACE
HE WAS CONSTANTLY ON
THE ALERT TRYING GAUGE COCKS AND WATCHING THINGS
THE DANGEROUS PLACE
WAS ON SLOW PLODDING BOATS WHERE THE ENGINEERS DROWSED AROUND AND
ALLOWED CHIPS TO GET INTO THE 'DOCTOR' AND SHUT OFF THE WATER SUPPLY
FROM THE BOILERS
IN THE 'FLUSH TIMES' OF STEAMBOATING A RACE BETWEEN TWO NOTORIOUSLY
FLEET STEAMERS WAS AN EVENT OF VAST IMPORTANCE
THE DATE WAS SET FOR
IT SEVERAL WEEKS IN ADVANCE AND FROM THAT TIME FORWARD THE WHOLE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WAS IN A STATE OF CONSUMING EXCITEMENT
POLITICS AND
THE WEATHER WERE DROPPED AND PEOPLE TALKED ONLY OF THE COMING RACE
AS
THE TIME APPROACHED THE TWO STEAMERS 'STRIPPED' AND GOT READY
EVERY
ENCUMBRANCE THAT ADDED WEIGHT OR EXPOSED A RESISTING SURFACE TO WIND
OR WATER WAS REMOVED IF THE BOAT COULD POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT IT
THE
'SPARS AND SOMETIMES EVEN THEIR SUPPORTING DERRICKS WERE SENT ASHORE
AND NO MEANS LEFT TO SET THE BOAT AFLOAT IN CASE SHE GOT AGROUND
WHEN
THE 'ECLIPSE' AND THE 'A
L
SHOTWELL' RAN THEIR GREAT RACE MANY YEARS
AGO IT WAS SAID THAT PAINS WERE TAKEN TO SCRAPE THE GILDING OFF THE
FANCIFUL DEVICE WHICH HUNG BETWEEN THE 'ECLIPSE'S' CHIMNEYS AND THAT
FOR THAT ONE TRIP THE CAPTAIN LEFT OFF HIS KID GLOVES AND HAD HIS HEAD
SHAVED
BUT I ALWAYS DOUBTED THESE THINGS
IF THE BOAT WAS KNOWN TO MAKE HER BEST SPEED WHEN DRAWING FIVE AND A
HALF FEET FORWARD AND FIVE FEET AFT SHE WAS CAREFULLY LOADED TO THAT
EXACT FIGURE SHE WOULDN'T ENTER A DOSE OF HOMOEOPATHIC PILLS ON HER
MANIFEST AFTER THAT
HARDLY ANY PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN BECAUSE THEY NOT
ONLY ADD WEIGHT BUT THEY NEVER WILL 'TRIM BOAT THEY ALWAYS RUN TO
THE SIDE WHEN THERE IS ANYTHING TO SEE WHEREAS A CONSCIENTIOUS AND
EXPERIENCED STEAMBOATMAN WOULD STICK TO THE CENTER OF THE BOAT AND PART
HIS HAIR IN THE MIDDLE WITH A SPIRIT LEVEL
NO WAY FREIGHTS AND NO WAY PASSENGERS WERE ALLOWED FOR THE RACERS WOULD
STOP ONLY AT THE LARGEST TOWNS AND THEN IT WOULD BE ONLY 'TOUCH AND
GO COAL FLATS AND WOOD FLATS WERE CONTRACTED FOR BEFOREHAND AND
THESE WERE KEPT READY TO HITCH ON TO THE FLYING STEAMERS AT A MOMENT'S
WARNING
DOUBLE CREWS WERE CARRIED SO THAT ALL WORK COULD BE QUICKLY
DONE
THE CHOSEN DATE BEING COME AND ALL THINGS IN READINESS THE TWO GREAT
STEAMERS BACK INTO THE STREAM AND LIE THERE JOCKEYING A MOMENT AND
APPARENTLY WATCHING EACH OTHER'S SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT LIKE SENTIENT
CREATURES FLAGS DROOPING THE PENT STEAM SHRIEKING THROUGH
SAFETY VALVES THE BLACK SMOKE ROLLING AND TUMBLING FROM THE CHIMNEYS
AND DARKENING ALL THE AIR
PEOPLE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE THE SHORES THE
HOUSE TOPS THE STEAMBOATS THE SHIPS ARE PACKED WITH THEM AND YOU
KNOW THAT THE BORDERS OF THE BROAD MISSISSIPPI ARE GOING TO BE FRINGED
WITH HUMANITY THENCE NORTHWARD TWELVE HUNDRED MILES TO WELCOME THESE
RACERS
PRESENTLY TALL COLUMNS OF STEAM BURST FROM THE 'SCAPE PIPES OF BOTH
STEAMERS TWO GUNS BOOM A GOOD BYE TWO RED SHIRTED HEROES MOUNTED
ON CAPSTANS WAVE THEIR SMALL FLAGS ABOVE THE MASSED CREWS ON THE
FORECASTLES TWO PLAINTIVE SOLOS LINGER ON THE AIR A FEW WAITING
SECONDS TWO MIGHTY CHORUSES BURST FORTH AND HERE THEY COME BRASS
BANDS BRAY HAIL COLUMBIA HUZZA AFTER HUZZA THUNDERS FROM THE SHORES
AND THE STATELY CREATURES GO WHISTLING BY LIKE THE WIND
THOSE BOATS WILL NEVER HALT A MOMENT BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS AND ST
LOUIS
EXCEPT FOR A SECOND OR TWO AT LARGE TOWNS OR TO HITCH THIRTY CORD
WOOD BOATS ALONGSIDE
YOU SHOULD BE ON BOARD WHEN THEY TAKE A COUPLE OF
THOSE WOOD BOATS IN TOW AND TURN A SWARM OF MEN INTO EACH BY THE TIME
YOU HAVE WIPED YOUR GLASSES AND PUT THEM ON YOU WILL BE WONDERING WHAT
HAS BECOME OF THAT WOOD
TWO NICELY MATCHED STEAMERS WILL STAY IN SIGHT OF EACH OTHER DAY AFTER
DAY
THEY MIGHT EVEN STAY SIDE BY SIDE BUT FOR THE FACT THAT PILOTS ARE
NOT ALL ALIKE AND THE SMARTEST PILOTS WILL WIN THE RACE
IF ONE OF THE
BOATS HAS A 'LIGHTNING' PILOT WHOSE 'PARTNER' IS A TRIFLE HIS INFERIOR
YOU CAN TELL WHICH ONE IS ON WATCH BY NOTING WHETHER THAT BOAT HAS
GAINED GROUND OR LOST SOME DURING EACH FOUR HOUR STRETCH
THE SHREWDEST
PILOT CAN DELAY A BOAT IF HE HAS NOT A FINE GENIUS FOR STEERING
STEERING IS A VERY HIGH ART
ONE MUST NOT KEEP A RUDDER DRAGGING ACROSS
A BOAT'S STEM IF HE WANTS TO GET UP THE RIVER FAST
THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE IN BOATS OF COURSE
FOR A LONG TIME I WAS
ON A BOAT THAT WAS SO SLOW WE USED TO FORGET WHAT YEAR IT WAS WE LEFT
PORT IN
BUT OF COURSE THIS WAS AT RARE INTERVALS
FERRYBOATS USED TO
LOSE VALUABLE TRIPS BECAUSE THEIR PASSENGERS GREW OLD AND DIED WAITING
FOR US TO GET BY
THIS WAS AT STILL RARER INTERVALS
I HAD THE DOCUMENTS
FOR THESE OCCURRENCES BUT THROUGH CARELESSNESS THEY HAVE BEEN MISLAID
THIS BOAT THE 'JOHN J
ROE WAS SO SLOW THAT WHEN SHE FINALLY SUNK IN
MADRID BEND IT WAS FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE OWNERS HEARD OF IT
THAT WAS
ALWAYS A CONFUSING FACT TO ME BUT IT IS ACCORDING TO THE RECORD ANY
WAY
SHE WAS DISMALLY SLOW STILL WE OFTEN HAD PRETTY EXCITING TIMES
RACING WITH ISLANDS AND RAFTS AND SUCH THINGS
ONE TRIP HOWEVER WE
DID RATHER WELL
WE WENT TO ST
LOUIS IN SIXTEEN DAYS
BUT EVEN AT
THIS RATTLING GAIT I THINK WE CHANGED WATCHES THREE TIMES IN FORT ADAMS
REACH WHICH IS FIVE MILES LONG
A 'REACH' IS A PIECE OF STRAIGHT RIVER
AND OF COURSE THE CURRENT DRIVES THROUGH SUCH A PLACE IN A PRETTY LIVELY
WAY
THAT TRIP WE WENT TO GRAND GULF FROM NEW ORLEANS IN FOUR DAYS THREE
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES THE 'ECLIPSE' AND 'SHOTWELL' DID IT IN ONE
WE WERE NINE DAYS OUT IN THE CHUTE OF 63 SEVEN HUNDRED MILES THE
'ECLIPSE' AND 'SHOTWELL' WENT THERE IN TWO DAYS
SOMETHING OVER A
GENERATION AGO A BOAT CALLED THE 'J
M
WHITE' WENT FROM NEW ORLEANS
TO CAIRO IN THREE DAYS SIX HOURS AND FORTY FOUR MINUTES
IN 1853 THE
'ECLIPSE' MADE THE SAME TRIP IN THREE DAYS THREE HOURS AND TWENTY
MINUTES FOOTNOTE TIME DISPUTED
SOME AUTHORITIES ADD 1 HOUR AND 16
MINUTES TO THIS IN 1870 THE 'R
E
LEE' DID IT IN THREE DAYS AND
ONE HOUR
THIS LAST IS CALLED THE FASTEST TRIP ON RECORD
I WILL
TRY TO SHOW THAT IT WAS NOT
FOR THIS REASON THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
NEW ORLEANS AND CAIRO WHEN THE 'J
M
WHITE' RAN IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN
HUNDRED AND SIX MILES CONSEQUENTLY HER AVERAGE SPEED WAS A TRIFLE OVER
FOURTEEN MILES PER HOUR
IN THE 'ECLIPSE'S' DAY THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
THE TWO PORTS HAD BECOME REDUCED TO ONE THOUSAND AND EIGHTY MILES
CONSEQUENTLY HER AVERAGE SPEED WAS A SHADE UNDER FOURTEEN AND
THREE EIGHTHS MILES PER HOUR
IN THE 'R
E
LEE'S' TIME THE DISTANCE
HAD DIMINISHED TO ABOUT ONE THOUSAND AND THIRTY MILES CONSEQUENTLY HER
AVERAGE WAS ABOUT FOURTEEN AND ONE EIGHTH MILES PER HOUR
THEREFORE THE
'ECLIPSE'S' WAS CONSPICUOUSLY THE FASTEST TIME THAT HAS EVER BEEN MADE
CHAPTER 17
CUT OFFS AND STEPHEN
THESE DRY DETAILS ARE OF IMPORTANCE IN ONE PARTICULAR
THEY GIVE ME
AN OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING ONE OF THE MISSISSIPPI'S ODDEST
PECULIARITIES THAT OF SHORTENING ITS LENGTH FROM TIME TO TIME
IF
YOU WILL THROW A LONG PLIANT APPLE PARING OVER YOUR SHOULDER IT WILL
PRETTY FAIRLY SHAPE ITSELF INTO AN AVERAGE SECTION OF THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER THAT IS THE NINE OR TEN HUNDRED MILES STRETCHING FROM CAIRO
ILLINOIS SOUTHWARD TO NEW ORLEANS THE SAME BEING WONDERFULLY CROOKED
WITH A BRIEF STRAIGHT BIT HERE AND THERE AT WIDE INTERVALS
THE TWO
HUNDRED MILE STRETCH FROM CAIRO NORTHWARD TO ST
LOUIS IS BY NO MEANS SO
CROOKED THAT BEING A ROCKY COUNTRY WHICH THE RIVER CANNOT CUT MUCH
THE WATER CUTS THE ALLUVIAL BANKS OF THE 'LOWER' RIVER INTO DEEP
HORSESHOE CURVES SO DEEP INDEED THAT IN SOME PLACES IF YOU WERE TO
GET ASHORE AT ONE EXTREMITY OF THE HORSESHOE AND WALK ACROSS THE NECK
HALF OR THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE YOU COULD SIT DOWN AND REST A COUPLE
OF HOURS WHILE YOUR STEAMER WAS COMING AROUND THE LONG ELBOW AT A SPEED
OF TEN MILES AN HOUR TO TAKE YOU ABOARD AGAIN
WHEN THE RIVER IS
RISING FAST SOME SCOUNDREL WHOSE PLANTATION IS BACK IN THE COUNTRY AND
THEREFORE OF INFERIOR VALUE HAS ONLY TO WATCH HIS CHANCE CUT A LITTLE
GUTTER ACROSS THE NARROW NECK OF LAND SOME DARK NIGHT AND TURN THE
WATER INTO IT AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME A MIRACLE HAS HAPPENED
TO WIT THE WHOLE MISSISSIPPI HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THAT LITTLE DITCH
AND PLACED THE COUNTRYMAN'S PLANTATION ON ITS BANK QUADRUPLING ITS
VALUE AND THAT OTHER PARTY'S FORMERLY VALUABLE PLANTATION FINDS ITSELF
AWAY OUT YONDER ON A BIG ISLAND THE OLD WATERCOURSE AROUND IT WILL SOON
SHOAL UP BOATS CANNOT APPROACH WITHIN TEN MILES OF IT AND DOWN GOES
ITS VALUE TO A FOURTH OF ITS FORMER WORTH
WATCHES ARE KEPT ON THOSE
NARROW NECKS AT NEEDFUL TIMES AND IF A MAN HAPPENS TO BE CAUGHT
CUTTING A DITCH ACROSS THEM THE CHANCES ARE ALL AGAINST HIS EVER HAVING
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CUT A DITCH
PRAY OBSERVE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF THIS DITCHING BUSINESS
ONCE THERE
WAS A NECK OPPOSITE PORT HUDSON LOUISIANA WHICH WAS ONLY HALF A MILE
ACROSS IN ITS NARROWEST PLACE
YOU COULD WALK ACROSS THERE IN FIFTEEN
MINUTES BUT IF YOU MADE THE JOURNEY AROUND THE CAPE ON A RAFT YOU
TRAVELED THIRTY FIVE MILES TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING
IN 1722 THE
RIVER DARTED THROUGH THAT NECK DESERTED ITS OLD BED AND THUS
SHORTENED ITSELF THIRTY FIVE MILES
IN THE SAME WAY IT SHORTENED ITSELF
TWENTY FIVE MILES AT BLACK HAWK POINT IN 1699
BELOW RED RIVER LANDING
RACCOURCI CUT OFF WAS MADE FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS AGO I THINK
THIS
SHORTENED THE RIVER TWENTY EIGHT MILES
IN OUR DAY IF YOU TRAVEL BY
RIVER FROM THE SOUTHERNMOST OF THESE THREE CUT OFFS TO THE NORTHERNMOST
YOU GO ONLY SEVENTY MILES
TO DO THE SAME THING A HUNDRED AND
SEVENTY SIX YEARS AGO ONE HAD TO GO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT
MILES SHORTENING OF EIGHTY EIGHT MILES IN THAT TRIFLING DISTANCE
AT SOME FORGOTTEN TIME IN THE PAST CUT OFFS WERE MADE ABOVE VIDALIA
LOUISIANA AT ISLAND 92 AT ISLAND 84 AND AT HALE'S POINT
THESE
SHORTENED THE RIVER IN THE AGGREGATE SEVENTY SEVEN MILES
SINCE MY OWN DAY ON THE MISSISSIPPI CUT OFFS HAVE BEEN MADE AT
HURRICANE ISLAND AT ISLAND 100 AT NAPOLEON ARKANSAS AT WALNUT
BEND AND AT COUNCIL BEND
THESE SHORTENED THE RIVER IN THE AGGREGATE
SIXTY SEVEN MILES
IN MY OWN TIME A CUT OFF WAS MADE AT AMERICAN BEND
WHICH SHORTENED THE RIVER TEN MILES OR MORE
THEREFORE THE MISSISSIPPI BETWEEN CAIRO AND NEW ORLEANS WAS TWELVE
HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILES LONG ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX YEARS AGO
IT WAS ELEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY AFTER THE CUT OFF OF 1722
IT WAS
ONE THOUSAND AND FORTY AFTER THE AMERICAN BEND CUT OFF
IT HAS LOST
SIXTY SEVEN MILES SINCE
CONSEQUENTLY ITS LENGTH IS ONLY NINE HUNDRED
AND SEVENTY THREE MILES AT PRESENT
NOW IF I WANTED TO BE ONE OF THOSE PONDEROUS SCIENTIFIC PEOPLE AND
'LET ON' TO PROVE WHAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE REMOTE PAST BY WHAT HAD
OCCURRED IN A GIVEN TIME IN THE RECENT PAST OR WHAT WILL OCCUR IN THE
FAR FUTURE BY WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN LATE YEARS WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY IS
HERE GEOLOGY NEVER HAD SUCH A CHANCE NOR SUCH EXACT DATA TO ARGUE
FROM NOR 'DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIES EITHER GLACIAL EPOCHS ARE GREAT
THINGS BUT THEY ARE VAGUE VAGUE
PLEASE OBSERVE
IN THE SPACE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX YEARS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI
HAS SHORTENED ITSELF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILES
THAT IS AN AVERAGE
OF A TRIFLE OVER ONE MILE AND A THIRD PER YEAR
THEREFORE ANY CALM
PERSON WHO IS NOT BLIND OR IDIOTIC CAN SEE THAT IN THE OLD OOLITIC
SILURIAN PERIOD JUST A MILLION YEARS AGO NEXT NOVEMBER THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI RIVER WAS UPWARDS OF ONE MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND
MILES LONG AND STUCK OUT OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO LIKE A FISHING ROD
AND BY THE SAME TOKEN ANY PERSON CAN SEE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND
FORTY TWO YEARS FROM NOW THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI WILL BE ONLY A MILE AND
THREE QUARTERS LONG AND CAIRO AND NEW ORLEANS WILL HAVE JOINED THEIR
STREETS TOGETHER AND BE PLODDING COMFORTABLY ALONG UNDER A SINGLE MAYOR
AND A MUTUAL BOARD OF ALDERMEN
THERE IS SOMETHING FASCINATING ABOUT
SCIENCE
ONE GETS SUCH WHOLESALE RETURNS OF CONJECTURE OUT OF SUCH A
TRIFLING INVESTMENT OF FACT
WHEN THE WATER BEGINS TO FLOW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE DITCHES I HAVE BEEN
SPEAKING OF IT IS TIME FOR THE PEOPLE THEREABOUTS TO MOVE
THE WATER
CLEAVES THE BANKS AWAY LIKE A KNIFE
BY THE TIME THE DITCH HAS BECOME
TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET WIDE THE CALAMITY IS AS GOOD AS ACCOMPLISHED
FOR NO POWER ON EARTH CAN STOP IT NOW
WHEN THE WIDTH HAS REACHED A
HUNDRED YARDS THE BANKS BEGIN TO PEEL OFF IN SLICES HALF AN ACRE WIDE
THE CURRENT FLOWING AROUND THE BEND TRAVELED FORMERLY ONLY FIVE MILES
AN HOUR NOW IT IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED BY THE SHORTENING OF THE
DISTANCE
I WAS ON BOARD THE FIRST BOAT THAT TRIED TO GO THROUGH THE
CUT OFF AT AMERICAN BEND BUT WE DID NOT GET THROUGH
IT WAS TOWARD
MIDNIGHT AND A WILD NIGHT IT WAS THUNDER LIGHTNING AND TORRENTS OF
RAIN
IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THE CURRENT IN THE CUT OFF WAS MAKING ABOUT
FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES AN HOUR TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WAS THE BEST OUR
BOAT COULD DO EVEN IN TOLERABLY SLACK WATER THEREFORE PERHAPS WE WERE
FOOLISH TO TRY THE CUT OFF
HOWEVER MR
BROWN WAS AMBITIOUS AND HE
KEPT ON TRYING
THE EDDY RUNNING UP THE BANK UNDER THE 'POINT WAS
ABOUT AS SWIFT AS THE CURRENT OUT IN THE MIDDLE SO WE WOULD GO FLYING
UP THE SHORE LIKE A LIGHTNING EXPRESS TRAIN GET ON A BIG HEAD OF STEAM
AND 'STAND BY FOR A SURGE' WHEN WE STRUCK THE CURRENT THAT WAS WHIRLING
BY THE POINT
BUT ALL OUR PREPARATIONS WERE USELESS
THE INSTANT THE
CURRENT HIT US IT SPUN US AROUND LIKE A TOP THE WATER DELUGED THE
FORECASTLE AND THE BOAT CAREENED SO FAR OVER THAT ONE COULD HARDLY KEEP
HIS FEET
THE NEXT INSTANT WE WERE AWAY DOWN THE RIVER CLAWING WITH
MIGHT AND MAIN TO KEEP OUT OF THE WOODS
WE TRIED THE EXPERIMENT
FOUR TIMES
I STOOD ON THE FORECASTLE COMPANION WAY TO SEE
IT WAS
ASTONISHING TO OBSERVE HOW SUDDENLY THE BOAT WOULD SPIN AROUND AND TURN
TAIL THE MOMENT SHE EMERGED FROM THE EDDY AND THE CURRENT STRUCK HER
NOSE
THE SOUNDING CONCUSSION AND THE QUIVERING WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT
THE SAME IF SHE HAD COME FULL SPEED AGAINST A SAND BANK
UNDER THE
LIGHTNING FLASHES ONE COULD SEE THE PLANTATION CABINS AND THE GOODLY
ACRES TUMBLE INTO THE RIVER AND THE CRASH THEY MADE WAS NOT A BAD
EFFORT AT THUNDER
ONCE WHEN WE SPUN AROUND WE ONLY MISSED A HOUSE
ABOUT TWENTY FEET THAT HAD A LIGHT BURNING IN THE WINDOW AND IN
THE SAME INSTANT THAT HOUSE WENT OVERBOARD
NOBODY COULD STAY ON OUR
FORECASTLE THE WATER SWEPT ACROSS IT IN A TORRENT EVERY TIME WE PLUNGED
ATHWART THE CURRENT
AT THE END OF OUR FOURTH EFFORT WE BROUGHT UP
IN THE WOODS TWO MILES BELOW THE CUT OFF ALL THE COUNTRY THERE WAS
OVERFLOWED OF COURSE
A DAY OR TWO LATER THE CUT OFF WAS THREE QUARTERS
OF A MILE WIDE AND BOATS PASSED UP THROUGH IT WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY
AND SO SAVED TEN MILES
THE OLD RACCOURCI CUT OFF REDUCED THE RIVER'S LENGTH TWENTY EIGHT MILES
THERE USED TO BE A TRADITION CONNECTED WITH IT
IT WAS SAID THAT A BOAT
CAME ALONG THERE IN THE NIGHT AND WENT AROUND THE ENORMOUS ELBOW THE
USUAL WAY THE PILOTS NOT KNOWING THAT THE CUT OFF HAD BEEN MADE
IT WAS
A GRISLY HIDEOUS NIGHT AND ALL SHAPES WERE VAGUE AND DISTORTED
THE
OLD BEND HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FILL UP AND THE BOAT GOT TO RUNNING
AWAY FROM MYSTERIOUS REEFS AND OCCASIONALLY HITTING ONE
THE PERPLEXED
PILOTS FELL TO SWEARING AND FINALLY UTTERED THE ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY
WISH THAT THEY MIGHT NEVER GET OUT OF THAT PLACE
AS ALWAYS HAPPENS
IN SUCH CASES THAT PARTICULAR PRAYER WAS ANSWERED AND THE OTHERS
NEGLECTED
SO TO THIS DAY THAT PHANTOM STEAMER IS STILL BUTTING AROUND
IN THAT DESERTED RIVER TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
MORE THAN ONE GRAVE
WATCHMAN HAS SWORN TO ME THAT ON DRIZZLY DISMAL NIGHTS HE HAS GLANCED
FEARFULLY DOWN THAT FORGOTTEN RIVER AS HE PASSED THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
AND SEEN THE FAINT GLOW OF THE SPECTER STEAMER'S LIGHTS DRIFTING THROUGH
THE DISTANT GLOOM AND HEARD THE MUFFLED COUGH OF HER 'SCAPE PIPES AND
THE PLAINTIVE CRY OF HER LEADSMEN
IN THE ABSENCE OF FURTHER STATISTICS I BEG TO CLOSE THIS CHAPTER WITH
ONE MORE REMINISCENCE OF 'STEPHEN
MOST OF THE CAPTAINS AND PILOTS HELD STEPHEN'S NOTE FOR BORROWED SUMS
RANGING FROM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS UPWARD
STEPHEN NEVER PAID
ONE OF THESE NOTES BUT HE WAS VERY PROMPT AND VERY ZEALOUS ABOUT
RENEWING THEM EVERY TWELVE MONTHS
OF COURSE THERE CAME A TIME AT LAST WHEN STEPHEN COULD NO LONGER
BORROW OF HIS ANCIENT CREDITORS SO HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE IN WAIT FOR
NEW MEN WHO DID NOT KNOW HIM
SUCH A VICTIM WAS GOOD HEARTED SIMPLE
NATURED YOUNG YATES I USE A FICTITIOUS NAME BUT THE REAL NAME BEGAN
AS THIS ONE DOES WITH A Y
YOUNG YATES GRADUATED AS A PILOT GOT A
BERTH AND WHEN THE MONTH WAS ENDED AND HE STEPPED UP TO THE CLERK'S
OFFICE AND RECEIVED HIS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN CRISP NEW
BILLS STEPHEN WAS THERE HIS SILVERY TONGUE BEGAN TO WAG AND IN A VERY
LITTLE WHILE YATES'S TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HAD CHANGED HANDS
THE FACT WAS SOON KNOWN AT PILOT HEADQUARTERS AND THE AMUSEMENT AND
SATISFACTION OF THE OLD CREDITORS WERE LARGE AND GENEROUS
BUT INNOCENT
YATES NEVER SUSPECTED THAT STEPHEN'S PROMISE TO PAY PROMPTLY AT THE
END OF THE WEEK WAS A WORTHLESS ONE
YATES CALLED FOR HIS MONEY AT THE
STIPULATED TIME STEPHEN SWEETENED HIM UP AND PUT HIM OFF A WEEK
HE
CALLED THEN ACCORDING TO AGREEMENT AND CAME AWAY SUGAR COATED AGAIN
BUT SUFFERING UNDER ANOTHER POSTPONEMENT
SO THE THING WENT ON
YATES
HAUNTED STEPHEN WEEK AFTER WEEK TO NO PURPOSE AND AT LAST GAVE IT
UP
AND THEN STRAIGHTWAY STEPHEN BEGAN TO HAUNT YATES WHEREVER YATES
APPEARED THERE WAS THE INEVITABLE STEPHEN
AND NOT ONLY THERE BUT
BEAMING WITH AFFECTION AND GUSHING WITH APOLOGIES FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO
PAY
BY AND BY WHENEVER POOR YATES SAW HIM COMING HE WOULD TURN AND
FLY AND DRAG HIS COMPANY WITH HIM IF HE HAD COMPANY BUT IT WAS OF
NO USE HIS DEBTOR WOULD RUN HIM DOWN AND CORNER HIM
PANTING AND
RED FACED STEPHEN WOULD COME WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND EAGER EYES
INVADE THE CONVERSATION SHAKE BOTH OF YATES'S ARMS LOOSE IN THEIR
SOCKETS AND BEGIN
'MY WHAT A RACE I'VE HAD I SAW YOU DIDN'T SEE ME AND SO I CLAPPED ON
ALL STEAM FOR FEAR I'D MISS YOU ENTIRELY
AND HERE YOU ARE THERE JUST
STAND SO AND LET ME LOOK AT YOU JUST THE SAME OLD NOBLE COUNTENANCE
TO YATES'S FRIEND 'JUST LOOK AT HIM LOOK AT HIM AIN'T IT JUST
GOOD TO LOOK AT HIM AIN'T IT NOW AIN'T HE JUST A PICTURE SOME
CALL HIM A PICTURE I CALL HIM A PANORAMA THAT'S WHAT HE IS AN ENTIRE
PANORAMA
AND NOW I'M REMINDED HOW I DO WISH I COULD HAVE SEEN YOU AN
HOUR EARLIER FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS I'VE BEEN SAVING UP THAT TWO HUNDRED
AND FIFTY DOLLARS FOR YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU EVERYWHERE
I WAITED AT
THE PLANTER'S FROM SIX YESTERDAY EVENING TILL TWO O'CLOCK THIS MORNING
WITHOUT REST OR FOOD MY WIFE SAYS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL NIGHT
I SAID THIS DEBT LIES HEAVY ON MY MIND SHE SAYS IN ALL MY DAYS I
NEVER SAW A MAN TAKE A DEBT TO HEART THE WAY YOU DO I SAID IT'S MY
NATURE HOW CAN I CHANGE IT SHE SAYS WELL DO GO TO BED AND GET SOME
REST I SAID NOT TILL THAT POOR NOBLE YOUNG MAN HAS GOT HIS MONEY
SO I SET UP ALL NIGHT AND THIS MORNING OUT I SHOT AND THE FIRST MAN
I STRUCK TOLD ME YOU HAD SHIPPED ON THE GRAND TURK AND GONE TO NEW
ORLEANS
WELL SIR I HAD TO LEAN UP AGAINST A BUILDING AND CRY
SO HELP
ME GOODNESS I COULDN'T HELP IT
THE MAN THAT OWNED THE PLACE COME
OUT CLEANING UP WITH A RAG AND SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE CRY
AGAINST HIS BUILDING AND THEN IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE WHOLE WORLD HAD
TURNED AGAINST ME AND IT WASN'T ANY USE TO LIVE ANY MORE AND COMING
ALONG AN HOUR AGO SUFFERING NO MAN KNOWS WHAT AGONY I MET JIM WILSON
AND PAID HIM THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS ON ACCOUNT AND TO THINK
THAT HERE YOU ARE NOW AND I HAVEN'T GOT A CENT BUT AS SURE AS I AM
STANDING HERE ON THIS GROUND ON THIS PARTICULAR BRICK THERE I'VE
SCRATCHED A MARK ON THE BRICK TO REMEMBER IT BY I'LL BORROW THAT MONEY
AND PAY IT OVER TO YOU AT TWELVE O'CLOCK SHARP TOMORROW NOW STAND SO
LET ME LOOK AT YOU JUST ONCE MORE
AND SO ON
YATES'S LIFE BECAME A BURDEN TO HIM
HE COULD NOT ESCAPE HIS
DEBTOR AND HIS DEBTOR'S AWFUL SUFFERINGS ON ACCOUNT OF NOT BEING ABLE
TO PAY
HE DREADED TO SHOW HIMSELF IN THE STREET LEST HE SHOULD FIND
STEPHEN LYING IN WAIT FOR HIM AT THE CORNER
BOGART'S BILLIARD SALOON WAS A GREAT RESORT FOR PILOTS IN THOSE DAYS
THEY MET THERE ABOUT AS MUCH TO EXCHANGE RIVER NEWS AS TO PLAY
ONE
MORNING YATES WAS THERE STEPHEN WAS THERE TOO BUT KEPT OUT OF SIGHT
BUT BY AND BY WHEN ABOUT ALL THE PILOTS HAD ARRIVED WHO WERE IN TOWN
STEPHEN SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE MIDST AND RUSHED FOR YATES AS FOR A
LONG LOST BROTHER
OH I AM SO GLAD TO SEE YOU OH MY SOUL THE SIGHT OF YOU IS SUCH A
COMFORT TO MY EYES GENTLEMEN I OWE ALL OF YOU MONEY AMONG YOU I OWE
PROBABLY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
I WANT TO PAY IT I INTEND TO PAY IT
EVERY LAST CENT OF IT
YOU ALL KNOW WITHOUT MY TELLING YOU WHAT SORROW
IT HAS COST ME TO REMAIN SO LONG UNDER SUCH DEEP OBLIGATIONS TO SUCH
PATIENT AND GENEROUS FRIENDS BUT THE SHARPEST PANG I SUFFER BY FAR
THE SHARPEST IS FROM THE DEBT I OWE TO THIS NOBLE YOUNG MAN HERE AND I
HAVE COME TO THIS PLACE THIS MORNING ESPECIALLY TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT
THAT I HAVE AT LAST FOUND A METHOD WHEREBY I CAN PAY OFF ALL MY DEBTS
AND MOST ESPECIALLY I WANTED HIM TO BE HERE WHEN I ANNOUNCED IT
YES
MY FAITHFUL FRIEND MY BENEFACTOR I'VE FOUND THE METHOD I'VE FOUND
THE METHOD TO PAY OFF ALL MY DEBTS AND YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY HOPE
DAWNED IN YATES'S EYE THEN STEPHEN BEAMING BENIGNANTLY AND PLACING
HIS HAND UPON YATES'S HEAD ADDED 'I AM GOING TO PAY THEM OFF IN
ALPHABETICAL ORDER
THEN HE TURNED AND DISAPPEARED
THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF STEPHEN'S
'METHOD' DID NOT DAWN UPON THE PERPLEXED AND MUSING CROWD FOR SOME TWO
MINUTES AND THEN YATES MURMURED WITH A SIGH
'WELL THE Y'S STAND A GAUDY CHANCE
HE WON'T GET ANY FURTHER THAN THE
C'S IN THIS WORLD AND I RECKON THAT AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF ETERNITY HAS
WASTED AWAY IN THE NEXT ONE I'LL STILL BE REFERRED TO UP THERE AS THAT
POOR RAGGED PILOT THAT CAME HERE FROM ST
LOUIS IN THE EARLY DAYS
CHAPTER 18
I TAKE A FEW EXTRA LESSONS
DURING THE TWO OR TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF MY APPRENTICESHIP I SERVED
UNDER MANY PILOTS AND HAD EXPERIENCE OF MANY KINDS OF STEAMBOATMEN AND
MANY VARIETIES OF STEAMBOATS FOR IT WAS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT FOR MR
BIXBY TO HAVE ME WITH HIM AND IN SUCH CASES HE SENT ME WITH SOMEBODY
ELSE
I AM TO THIS DAY PROFITING SOMEWHAT BY THAT EXPERIENCE FOR IN
THAT BRIEF SHARP SCHOOLING I GOT PERSONALLY AND FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTED
WITH ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HUMAN NATURE THAT ARE TO BE FOUND
IN FICTION BIOGRAPHY OR HISTORY
THE FACT IS DAILY BORNE IN UPON ME
THAT THE AVERAGE SHORE EMPLOYMENT REQUIRES AS MUCH AS FORTY YEARS
TO EQUIP A MAN WITH THIS SORT OF AN EDUCATION
WHEN I SAY I AM STILL
PROFITING BY THIS THING I DO NOT MEAN THAT IT HAS CONSTITUTED ME A
JUDGE OF MEN NO IT HAS NOT DONE THAT FOR JUDGES OF MEN ARE BORN NOT
MADE
MY PROFIT IS VARIOUS IN KIND AND DEGREE BUT THE FEATURE OF IT
WHICH I VALUE MOST IS THE ZEST WHICH THAT EARLY EXPERIENCE HAS GIVEN
TO MY LATER READING
WHEN I FIND A WELL DRAWN CHARACTER IN FICTION OR
BIOGRAPHY I GENERALLY TAKE A WARM PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM FOR THE
REASON THAT I HAVE KNOWN HIM BEFORE MET HIM ON THE RIVER
THE FIGURE THAT COMES BEFORE ME OFTENEST OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF THAT
VANISHED TIME IS THAT OF BROWN OF THE STEAMER 'PENNSYLVANIA' THE MAN
REFERRED TO IN A FORMER CHAPTER WHOSE MEMORY WAS SO GOOD AND TIRESOME
HE WAS A MIDDLE AGED LONG SLIM BONY SMOOTH SHAVEN HORSE FACED
IGNORANT STINGY MALICIOUS SNARLING FAULT HUNTING MOTE MAGNIFYING
TYRANT
I EARLY GOT THE HABIT OF COMING ON WATCH WITH DREAD AT MY HEART
NO MATTER HOW GOOD A TIME I MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH THE OFF WATCH
BELOW AND NO MATTER HOW HIGH MY SPIRITS MIGHT BE WHEN I STARTED ALOFT
MY SOUL BECAME LEAD IN MY BODY THE MOMENT I APPROACHED THE PILOT HOUSE
I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I EVER ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THAT MAN
THE BOAT HAD BACKED OUT FROM ST
LOUIS AND WAS 'STRAIGHTENING DOWN
I ASCENDED TO THE PILOT HOUSE IN HIGH FEATHER AND VERY PROUD TO BE
SEMI OFFICIALLY A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE FAMILY OF SO FAST AND FAMOUS
A BOAT
BROWN WAS AT THE WHEEL
I PAUSED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ALL
FIXED TO MAKE MY BOW BUT BROWN DID NOT LOOK AROUND
I THOUGHT HE TOOK A
FURTIVE GLANCE AT ME OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE BUT AS NOT EVEN THIS
NOTICE WAS REPEATED I JUDGED I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
BY THIS TIME HE WAS
PICKING HIS WAY AMONG SOME DANGEROUS 'BREAKS' ABREAST THE WOODYARDS
THEREFORE IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER TO INTERRUPT HIM SO I STEPPED SOFTLY
TO THE HIGH BENCH AND TOOK A SEAT
THERE WAS SILENCE FOR TEN MINUTES THEN MY NEW BOSS TURNED AND INSPECTED
ME DELIBERATELY AND PAINSTAKINGLY FROM HEAD TO HEEL FOR ABOUT AS
IT SEEMED TO ME A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
AFTER WHICH HE REMOVED HIS
COUNTENANCE AND I SAW IT NO MORE FOR SOME SECONDS THEN IT CAME AROUND
ONCE MORE AND THIS QUESTION GREETED ME
'ARE YOU HORACE BIGSBY'S CUB
'YES SIR
AFTER THIS THERE WAS A PAUSE AND ANOTHER INSPECTION
THEN
'WHAT'S YOUR NAME
I TOLD HIM
HE REPEATED IT AFTER ME
IT WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY THING HE
EVER FORGOT FOR ALTHOUGH I WAS WITH HIM MANY MONTHS HE NEVER ADDRESSED
HIMSELF TO ME IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN 'HERE AND THEN HIS COMMAND
FOLLOWED
'WHERE WAS YOU BORN
'IN FLORIDA MISSOURI
A PAUSE
THEN
'DERN SIGHT BETTER STAID THERE
BY MEANS OF A DOZEN OR SO OF PRETTY DIRECT QUESTIONS HE PUMPED MY
FAMILY HISTORY OUT OF ME
THE LEADS WERE GOING NOW IN THE FIRST CROSSING
THIS INTERRUPTED THE
INQUEST
WHEN THE LEADS HAD BEEN LAID IN HE RESUMED
'HOW LONG YOU BEEN ON THE RIVER
I TOLD HIM
AFTER A PAUSE
'WHERE'D YOU GET THEM SHOES
I GAVE HIM THE INFORMATION
'HOLD UP YOUR FOOT
I DID SO
HE STEPPED BACK EXAMINED THE SHOE MINUTELY AND
CONTEMPTUOUSLY SCRATCHING HIS HEAD THOUGHTFULLY TILTING HIS
HIGH SUGAR LOAF HAT WELL FORWARD TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION THEN
EJACULATED 'WELL I'LL BE DOD DERNED AND RETURNED TO HIS WHEEL
WHAT OCCASION THERE WAS TO BE DOD DERNED ABOUT IT IS A THING WHICH IS
STILL AS MUCH OF A MYSTERY TO ME NOW AS IT WAS THEN
IT MUST HAVE
BEEN ALL OF FIFTEEN MINUTES FIFTEEN MINUTES OF DULL HOMESICK
SILENCE BEFORE THAT LONG HORSE FACE SWUNG ROUND UPON ME AGAIN AND
THEN WHAT A CHANGE IT WAS AS RED AS FIRE AND EVERY MUSCLE IN IT WAS
WORKING
NOW CAME THIS SHRIEK
'HERE YOU GOING TO SET THERE ALL DAY
I LIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SHOT THERE BY THE ELECTRIC
SUDDENNESS OF THE SURPRISE
AS SOON AS I COULD GET MY VOICE I SAID
APOLOGETICALLY 'I HAVE HAD NO ORDERS SIR
'YOU'VE HAD NO ORDERS MY WHAT A FINE BIRD WE ARE WE MUST HAVE
ORDERS OUR FATHER WAS A GENTLEMAN OWNED SLAVES AND WE'VE BEEN
TO SCHOOL
YES WE ARE A GENTLEMAN TOO AND GOT TO HAVE ORDERS
ORDERS IS IT ORDERS IS WHAT YOU WANT DOD DERN MY SKIN I'LL
LEARN YOU TO SWELL YOURSELF UP AND BLOW AROUND HERE ABOUT YOUR
DOD DERNED ORDERS G'WAY FROM THE WHEEL I HAD APPROACHED IT WITHOUT
KNOWING IT
I MOVED BACK A STEP OR TWO AND STOOD AS IN A DREAM ALL MY SENSES
STUPEFIED BY THIS FRANTIC ASSAULT
'WHAT YOU STANDING THERE FOR TAKE THAT ICE PITCHER DOWN TO THE
TEXAS TENDER COME MOVE ALONG AND DON'T YOU BE ALL DAY ABOUT IT
THE MOMENT I GOT BACK TO THE PILOT HOUSE BROWN SAID
'HERE WHAT WAS YOU DOING DOWN THERE ALL THIS TIME
'I COULDN'T FIND THE TEXAS TENDER I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE
PANTRY
'DERNED LIKELY STORY FILL UP THE STOVE
I PROCEEDED TO DO SO
HE WATCHED ME LIKE A CAT
PRESENTLY HE SHOUTED
'PUT DOWN THAT SHOVEL DEADEST NUMSKULL I EVER SAW AIN'T EVEN GOT SENSE
ENOUGH TO LOAD UP A STOVE
ALL THROUGH THE WATCH THIS SORT OF THING WENT ON
YES AND THE
SUBSEQUENT WATCHES WERE MUCH LIKE IT DURING A STRETCH OF MONTHS
AS I
HAVE SAID I SOON GOT THE HABIT OF COMING ON DUTY WITH DREAD
THE MOMENT
I WAS IN THE PRESENCE EVEN IN THE DARKEST NIGHT I COULD FEEL THOSE
YELLOW EYES UPON ME AND KNEW THEIR OWNER WAS WATCHING FOR A PRETEXT TO
SPIT OUT SOME VENOM ON ME
PRELIMINARILY HE WOULD SAY
'HERE TAKE THE WHEEL
TWO MINUTES LATER
WHERE IN THE NATION YOU GOING TO PULL HER DOWN PULL HER DOWN
AFTER ANOTHER MOMENT
'SAY YOU GOING TO HOLD HER ALL DAY LET HER GO MEET HER MEET HER
THEN HE WOULD JUMP FROM THE BENCH SNATCH THE WHEEL FROM ME AND MEET
HER HIMSELF POURING OUT WRATH UPON ME ALL THE TIME
GEORGE RITCHIE WAS THE OTHER PILOT'S CUB
HE WAS HAVING GOOD TIMES NOW
FOR HIS BOSS GEORGE EALER WAS AS KINDHEARTED AS BROWN WASN'T
RITCHIE
HAD STEELED FOR BROWN THE SEASON BEFORE CONSEQUENTLY HE KNEW EXACTLY
HOW TO ENTERTAIN HIMSELF AND PLAGUE ME ALL BY THE ONE OPERATION
WHENEVER I TOOK THE WHEEL FOR A MOMENT ON EALER'S WATCH RITCHIE WOULD
SIT BACK ON THE BENCH AND PLAY BROWN WITH CONTINUAL EJACULATIONS OF
'SNATCH HER SNATCH HER DERNDEST MUD CAT I EVER SAW 'HERE WHERE YOU
GOING NOW GOING TO RUN OVER THAT SNAG 'PULL HER DOWN DON'T YOU
HEAR ME PULL HER DOWN 'THERE SHE GOES JUST AS I EXPECTED I
TOLD YOU NOT TO CRAMP THAT REEF
G'WAY FROM THE WHEEL
SO I ALWAYS HAD A ROUGH TIME OF IT NO MATTER WHOSE WATCH IT WAS AND
SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT RITCHIE'S GOOD NATURED BADGERING WAS
PRETTY NEARLY AS AGGRAVATING AS BROWN'S DEAD EARNEST NAGGING
I OFTEN WANTED TO KILL BROWN BUT THIS WOULD NOT ANSWER
A CUB HAD
TO TAKE EVERYTHING HIS BOSS GAVE IN THE WAY OF VIGOROUS COMMENT AND
CRITICISM AND WE ALL BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS A UNITED STATES LAW MAKING
IT A PENITENTIARY OFFENSE TO STRIKE OR THREATEN A PILOT WHO WAS ON
DUTY
HOWEVER I COULD IMAGINE MYSELF KILLING BROWN THERE WAS NO LAW
AGAINST THAT AND THAT WAS THE THING I USED ALWAYS TO DO THE MOMENT I
WAS ABED
INSTEAD OF GOING OVER MY RIVER IN MY MIND AS WAS MY DUTY
I THREW BUSINESS ASIDE FOR PLEASURE AND KILLED BROWN
I KILLED BROWN
EVERY NIGHT FOR MONTHS NOT IN OLD STALE COMMONPLACE WAYS BUT IN NEW
AND PICTURESQUE ONES WAYS THAT WERE SOMETIMES SURPRISING FOR FRESHNESS
OF DESIGN AND GHASTLINESS OF SITUATION AND ENVIRONMENT
BROWN WAS ALWAYS WATCHING FOR A PRETEXT TO FIND FAULT AND IF HE COULD
FIND NO PLAUSIBLE PRETEXT HE WOULD INVENT ONE
HE WOULD SCOLD YOU FOR
SHAVING A SHORE AND FOR NOT SHAVING IT FOR HUGGING A BAR AND FOR NOT
HUGGING IT FOR 'PULLING DOWN' WHEN NOT INVITED AND FOR NOT PULLING
DOWN WHEN NOT INVITED FOR FIRING UP WITHOUT ORDERS AND FOR WAITING
FOR ORDERS
IN A WORD IT WAS HIS INVARIABLE RULE TO FIND FAULT WITH
EVERYTHING YOU DID AND ANOTHER INVARIABLE RULE OF HIS WAS TO THROW
ALL HIS REMARKS TO YOU INTO THE FORM OF AN INSULT
ONE DAY WE WERE APPROACHING NEW MADRID BOUND DOWN AND HEAVILY LADEN
BROWN WAS AT ONE SIDE OF THE WHEEL STEERING I WAS AT THE OTHER
STANDING BY TO 'PULL DOWN' OR 'SHOVE UP HE CAST A FURTIVE GLANCE AT ME
EVERY NOW AND THEN
I HAD LONG AGO LEARNED WHAT THAT MEANT VIZ HE WAS
TRYING TO INVENT A TRAP FOR ME
I WONDERED WHAT SHAPE IT WAS GOING TO
TAKE
BY AND BY HE STEPPED BACK FROM THE WHEEL AND SAID IN HIS USUAL
SNARLY WAY
'HERE SEE IF YOU'VE GOT GUMPTION ENOUGH TO ROUND HER TO
THIS WAS SIMPLY BOUND TO BE A SUCCESS NOTHING COULD PREVENT IT FOR
HE HAD NEVER ALLOWED ME TO ROUND THE BOAT TO BEFORE CONSEQUENTLY NO
MATTER HOW I MIGHT DO THE THING HE COULD FIND FREE FAULT WITH IT
HE
STOOD BACK THERE WITH HIS GREEDY EYE ON ME AND THE RESULT WAS WHAT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORESEEN I LOST MY HEAD IN A QUARTER OF A MINUTE AND
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS ABOUT I STARTED TOO EARLY TO BRING THE BOAT
AROUND BUT DETECTED A GREEN GLEAM OF JOY IN BROWN'S EYE AND CORRECTED
MY MISTAKE I STARTED AROUND ONCE MORE WHILE TOO HIGH UP BUT CORRECTED
MYSELF AGAIN IN TIME I MADE OTHER FALSE MOVES AND STILL MANAGED TO
SAVE MYSELF BUT AT LAST I GREW SO CONFUSED AND ANXIOUS THAT I TUMBLED
INTO THE VERY WORST BLUNDER OF ALL I GOT TOO FAR DOWN BEFORE BEGINNING
TO FETCH THE BOAT AROUND
BROWN'S CHANCE WAS COME
HIS FACE TURNED RED WITH PASSION HE MADE ONE BOUND HURLED ME ACROSS
THE HOUSE WITH A SWEEP OF HIS ARM SPUN THE WHEEL DOWN AND BEGAN TO
POUR OUT A STREAM OF VITUPERATION UPON ME WHICH LASTED TILL HE WAS OUT
OF BREATH
IN THE COURSE OF THIS SPEECH HE CALLED ME ALL THE DIFFERENT
KINDS OF HARD NAMES HE COULD THINK OF AND ONCE OR TWICE I THOUGHT HE
WAS EVEN GOING TO SWEAR BUT HE DIDN'T THIS TIME
'DOD DERN' WAS THE
NEAREST HE VENTURED TO THE LUXURY OF SWEARING FOR HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT
UP WITH A WHOLESOME RESPECT FOR FUTURE FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
THAT WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE HOUR FOR THERE WAS A BIG AUDIENCE ON THE
HURRICANE DECK
WHEN I WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT I KILLED BROWN IN
SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT WAYS ALL OF THEM NEW
CHAPTER 19
BROWN AND I EXCHANGE COMPLIMENTS
TWO TRIPS LATER I GOT INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE
BROWN WAS STEERING I WAS
'PULLING DOWN MY YOUNGER BROTHER APPEARED ON THE HURRICANE DECK AND
SHOUTED TO BROWN TO STOP AT SOME LANDING OR OTHER A MILE OR SO BELOW
BROWN GAVE NO INTIMATION THAT HE HAD HEARD ANYTHING
BUT THAT WAS HIS
WAY HE NEVER CONDESCENDED TO TAKE NOTICE OF AN UNDER CLERK
THE WIND
WAS BLOWING BROWN WAS DEAF ALTHOUGH HE ALWAYS PRETENDED HE WASN'T
AND I VERY MUCH DOUBTED IF HE HAD HEARD THE ORDER
IF I HAD TWO HEADS
I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN BUT AS I HAD ONLY ONE IT SEEMED JUDICIOUS TO TAKE
CARE OF IT SO I KEPT STILL
PRESENTLY SURE ENOUGH WE WENT SAILING BY THAT PLANTATION
CAPTAIN
KLINEFELTER APPEARED ON THE DECK AND SAID
'LET HER COME AROUND SIR LET HER COME AROUND
DIDN'T HENRY TELL YOU TO
LAND HERE
NO SIR
'I SENT HIM UP TO DO IT
'HE DID COME UP AND THAT'S ALL THE GOOD IT DONE THE DOD DERNED FOOL
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
'DIDN'T YOU HEAR HIM ASKED THE CAPTAIN OF ME
OF COURSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE MIXED UP IN THIS BUSINESS BUT THERE WAS
NO WAY TO AVOID IT SO I SAID
'YES SIR
I KNEW WHAT BROWN'S NEXT REMARK WOULD BE BEFORE HE UTTERED IT IT WAS
'SHUT YOUR MOUTH YOU NEVER HEARD ANYTHING OF THE KIND
I CLOSED MY MOUTH ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS
AN HOUR LATER HENRY
ENTERED THE PILOT HOUSE UNAWARE OF WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON
HE WAS A
THOROUGHLY INOFFENSIVE BOY AND I WAS SORRY TO SEE HIM COME FOR I KNEW
BROWN WOULD HAVE NO PITY ON HIM
BROWN BEGAN STRAIGHTWAY
'HERE WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WE'D GOT TO LAND AT THAT PLANTATION
'I DID TELL YOU MR
BROWN
'IT'S A LIE
I SAID
'YOU LIE YOURSELF
HE DID TELL YOU
BROWN GLARED AT ME IN UNAFFECTED SURPRISE AND FOR AS MUCH AS A MOMENT
HE WAS ENTIRELY SPEECHLESS THEN HE SHOUTED TO ME
'I'LL ATTEND TO YOUR CASE IN HALF A MINUTE THEN TO HENRY 'AND YOU
LEAVE THE PILOT HOUSE OUT WITH YOU
IT WAS PILOT LAW AND MUST BE OBEYED
THE BOY STARTED OUT AND EVEN HAD
HIS FOOT ON THE UPPER STEP OUTSIDE THE DOOR WHEN BROWN WITH A SUDDEN
ACCESS OF FURY PICKED UP A TEN POUND LUMP OF COAL AND SPRANG AFTER HIM
BUT I WAS BETWEEN WITH A HEAVY STOOL AND I HIT BROWN A GOOD HONEST
BLOW WHICH STRETCHED HIM OUT
I HAD COMMITTED THE CRIME OF CRIMES I HAD LIFTED MY HAND AGAINST A
PILOT ON DUTY I SUPPOSED I WAS BOOKED FOR THE PENITENTIARY SURE AND
COULDN'T BE BOOKED ANY SURER IF I WENT ON AND SQUARED MY LONG ACCOUNT
WITH THIS PERSON WHILE I HAD THE CHANCE CONSEQUENTLY I STUCK TO HIM AND
POUNDED HIM WITH MY FISTS A CONSIDERABLE TIME I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG
THE PLEASURE OF IT PROBABLY MADE IT SEEM LONGER THAN IT REALLY WAS BUT
IN THE END HE STRUGGLED FREE AND JUMPED UP AND SPRANG TO THE WHEEL A
VERY NATURAL SOLICITUDE FOR ALL THIS TIME HERE WAS THIS STEAMBOAT
TEARING DOWN THE RIVER AT THE RATE OF FIFTEEN MILES AN HOUR AND NOBODY
AT THE HELM HOWEVER EAGLE BEND WAS TWO MILES WIDE AT THIS BANK FULL
STAGE AND CORRESPONDINGLY LONG AND DEEP AND THE BOAT WAS STEERING
HERSELF STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE AND TAKING NO CHANCES
STILL THAT WAS
ONLY LUCK A BODY MIGHT HAVE FOUND HER CHARGING INTO THE WOODS
PERCEIVING AT A GLANCE THAT THE 'PENNSYLVANIA' WAS IN NO DANGER BROWN
GATHERED UP THE BIG SPY GLASS WAR CLUB FASHION AND ORDERED ME OUT OF
THE PILOT HOUSE WITH MORE THAN COMANCHE BLUSTER
BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF
HIM NOW SO INSTEAD OF GOING I TARRIED AND CRITICIZED HIS GRAMMAR I
REFORMED HIS FEROCIOUS SPEECHES FOR HIM AND PUT THEM INTO GOOD ENGLISH
CALLING HIS ATTENTION TO THE ADVANTAGE OF PURE ENGLISH OVER THE BASTARD
DIALECT OF THE PENNSYLVANIAN COLLIERIES WHENCE HE WAS EXTRACTED
HE COULD HAVE DONE HIS PART TO ADMIRATION IN A CROSS FIRE OF MERE
VITUPERATION OF COURSE BUT HE WAS NOT EQUIPPED FOR THIS SPECIES OF
CONTROVERSY SO HE PRESENTLY LAID ASIDE HIS GLASS AND TOOK THE WHEEL
MUTTERING AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AND I RETIRED TO THE BENCH
THE RACKET
HAD BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THE HURRICANE DECK AND I TREMBLED WHEN I
SAW THE OLD CAPTAIN LOOKING UP FROM THE MIDST OF THE CROWD
I SAID
TO MYSELF 'NOW I AM DONE FOR FOR ALTHOUGH AS A RULE HE WAS SO
FATHERLY AND INDULGENT TOWARD THE BOAT'S FAMILY AND SO PATIENT OF MINOR
SHORTCOMINGS HE COULD BE STERN ENOUGH WHEN THE FAULT WAS WORTH IT
I TRIED TO IMAGINE WHAT HE WOULD DO TO A CUB PILOT WHO HAD BEEN GUILTY
OF SUCH A CRIME AS MINE COMMITTED ON A BOAT GUARD DEEP WITH COSTLY
FREIGHT AND ALIVE WITH PASSENGERS
OUR WATCH WAS NEARLY ENDED
I THOUGHT
I WOULD GO AND HIDE SOMEWHERE TILL I GOT A CHANCE TO SLIDE ASHORE
SO
I SLIPPED OUT OF THE PILOT HOUSE AND DOWN THE STEPS AND AROUND TO
THE TEXAS DOOR AND WAS IN THE ACT OF GLIDING WITHIN WHEN THE CAPTAIN
CONFRONTED ME I DROPPED MY HEAD AND HE STOOD OVER ME IN SILENCE A
MOMENT OR TWO THEN SAID IMPRESSIVELY
'FOLLOW ME
I DROPPED INTO HIS WAKE HE LED THE WAY TO HIS PARLOR IN THE FORWARD END
OF THE TEXAS
WE WERE ALONE NOW
HE CLOSED THE AFTER DOOR THEN MOVED
SLOWLY TO THE FORWARD ONE AND CLOSED THAT
HE SAT DOWN I STOOD BEFORE
HIM
HE LOOKED AT ME SOME LITTLE TIME THEN SAID
'SO YOU HAVE BEEN FIGHTING MR
BROWN
I ANSWERED MEEKLY
'YES SIR
'DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER
'YES SIR
'ARE YOU AWARE THAT THIS BOAT WAS PLOWING DOWN THE RIVER FULLY FIVE
MINUTES WITH NO ONE AT THE WHEEL
'YES SIR
'DID YOU STRIKE HIM FIRST
'YES SIR
'WHAT WITH
'A STOOL SIR
'HARD
'MIDDLING SIR
'DID IT KNOCK HIM DOWN
'HE HE FELL SIR
'DID YOU FOLLOW IT UP DID YOU DO ANYTHING FURTHER
'YES SIR
'WHAT DID YOU DO
'POUNDED HIM SIR
'POUNDED HIM
'YES SIR
'DID YOU POUND HIM MUCH THAT IS SEVERELY
'ONE MIGHT CALL IT THAT SIR MAYBE
'I'M DEUCED GLAD OF IT HARK YE NEVER MENTION THAT I SAID THAT
YOU
HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF A GREAT CRIME AND DON'T YOU EVER BE GUILTY OF IT
AGAIN ON THIS BOAT
BUT LAY FOR HIM ASHORE GIVE HIM A GOOD SOUND
THRASHING DO YOU HEAR I'LL PAY THE EXPENSES
NOW GO AND MIND YOU NOT
A WORD OF THIS TO ANYBODY
CLEAR OUT WITH YOU YOU'VE BEEN GUILTY OF A
GREAT CRIME YOU WHELP
I SLID OUT HAPPY WITH THE SENSE OF A CLOSE SHAVE AND A MIGHTY
DELIVERANCE AND I HEARD HIM LAUGHING TO HIMSELF AND SLAPPING HIS FAT
THIGHS AFTER I HAD CLOSED HIS DOOR
WHEN BROWN CAME OFF WATCH HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS
TALKING WITH SOME PASSENGERS ON THE BOILER DECK AND DEMANDED THAT I BE
PUT ASHORE IN NEW ORLEANS AND ADDED
'I'LL NEVER TURN A WHEEL ON THIS BOAT AGAIN WHILE THAT CUB STAYS
THE CAPTAIN SAID
'BUT HE NEEDN'T COME ROUND WHEN YOU ARE ON WATCH MR
BROWN
'I WON'T EVEN STAY ON THE SAME BOAT WITH HIM
ONE OF US HAS GOT TO GO
ASHORE
'VERY WELL SAID THE CAPTAIN 'LET IT BE YOURSELF AND RESUMED HIS
TALK WITH THE PASSENGERS
DURING THE BRIEF REMAINDER OF THE TRIP I KNEW HOW AN EMANCIPATED SLAVE
FEELS FOR I WAS AN EMANCIPATED SLAVE MYSELF
WHILE WE LAY AT LANDINGS
I LISTENED TO GEORGE EALER'S FLUTE OR TO HIS READINGS FROM HIS TWO
BIBLES THAT IS TO SAY GOLDSMITH AND SHAKESPEARE OR I PLAYED CHESS
WITH HIM AND WOULD HAVE BEATEN HIM SOMETIMES ONLY HE ALWAYS TOOK BACK
HIS LAST MOVE AND RAN THE GAME OUT DIFFERENTLY
CHAPTER 20
A CATASTROPHE
WE LAY THREE DAYS IN NEW ORLEANS BUT THE CAPTAIN DID NOT SUCCEED IN
FINDING ANOTHER PILOT SO HE PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD STAND A DAYLIGHT
WATCH AND LEAVE THE NIGHT WATCHES TO GEORGE EALER
BUT I WAS AFRAID I
HAD NEVER STOOD A WATCH OF ANY SORT BY MYSELF AND I BELIEVED I SHOULD
BE SURE TO GET INTO TROUBLE IN THE HEAD OF SOME CHUTE OR GROUND THE
BOAT IN A NEAR CUT THROUGH SOME BAR OR OTHER
BROWN REMAINED IN HIS
PLACE BUT HE WOULD NOT TRAVEL WITH ME
SO THE CAPTAIN GAVE ME AN ORDER
ON THE CAPTAIN OF THE 'A
T
LACEY FOR A PASSAGE TO ST
LOUIS AND
SAID HE WOULD FIND A NEW PILOT THERE AND MY STEERSMAN'S BERTH COULD
THEN BE RESUMED
THE 'LACEY' WAS TO LEAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THE
'PENNSYLVANIA
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE PENNSYLVANIA LEFT HENRY AND I SAT CHATTING
ON A FREIGHT PILE ON THE LEVEE TILL MIDNIGHT
THE SUBJECT OF THE CHAT
MAINLY WAS ONE WHICH I THINK WE HAD NOT EXPLOITED BEFORE STEAMBOAT
DISASTERS
ONE WAS THEN ON ITS WAY TO US LITTLE AS WE SUSPECTED IT
THE WATER WHICH WAS TO MAKE THE STEAM WHICH SHOULD CAUSE IT WAS WASHING
PAST SOME POINT FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES UP THE RIVER WHILE WE TALKED BUT
IT WOULD ARRIVE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THE RIGHT PLACE
WE DOUBTED IF
PERSONS NOT CLOTHED WITH AUTHORITY WERE OF MUCH USE IN CASES OF DISASTER
AND ATTENDANT PANIC STILL THEY MIGHT BE OF SOME USE SO WE DECIDED
THAT IF A DISASTER EVER FELL WITHIN OUR EXPERIENCE WE WOULD AT LEAST
STICK TO THE BOAT AND GIVE SUCH MINOR SERVICE AS CHANCE MIGHT THROW IN
THE WAY
HENRY REMEMBERED THIS AFTERWARD WHEN THE DISASTER CAME AND
ACTED ACCORDINGLY
THE 'LACEY' STARTED UP THE RIVER TWO DAYS BEHIND THE 'PENNSYLVANIA WE
TOUCHED AT GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI A COUPLE OF DAYS OUT AND SOMEBODY
SHOUTED
'THE PENNSYLVANIA IS BLOWN UP AT SHIP ISLAND AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
LIVES LOST
AT NAPOLEON ARKANSAS THE SAME EVENING WE GOT AN EXTRA ISSUED BY A
MEMPHIS PAPER WHICH GAVE SOME PARTICULARS
IT MENTIONED MY BROTHER AND
SAID HE WAS NOT HURT
FURTHER UP THE RIVER WE GOT A LATER EXTRA
MY BROTHER WAS AGAIN
MENTIONED BUT THIS TIME AS BEING HURT BEYOND HELP
WE DID NOT GET
FULL DETAILS OF THE CATASTROPHE UNTIL WE REACHED MEMPHIS
THIS IS THE
SORROWFUL STORY
IT WAS SIX O'CLOCK ON A HOT SUMMER MORNING
THE 'PENNSYLVANIA' WAS
CREEPING ALONG NORTH OF SHIP ISLAND ABOUT SIXTY MILES BELOW MEMPHIS ON
A HALF HEAD OF STEAM TOWING A WOOD FLAT WHICH WAS FAST BEING EMPTIED
GEORGE EALER WAS IN THE PILOT HOUSE ALONE I THINK THE SECOND ENGINEER
AND A STRIKER HAD THE WATCH IN THE ENGINE ROOM THE SECOND MATE HAD
THE WATCH ON DECK GEORGE BLACK MR
WOOD AND MY BROTHER CLERKS WERE
ASLEEP AS WERE ALSO BROWN AND THE HEAD ENGINEER THE CARPENTER THE
CHIEF MATE AND ONE STRIKER CAPTAIN KLINEFELTER WAS IN THE BARBER'S
CHAIR AND THE BARBER WAS PREPARING TO SHAVE HIM
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY
CABIN PASSENGERS ABOARD AND THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DECK PASSENGERS SO
IT WAS SAID AT THE TIME AND NOT VERY MANY OF THEM WERE ASTIR
THE WOOD
BEING NEARLY ALL OUT OF THE FLAT NOW EALER RANG TO 'COME AHEAD' FULL
STEAM AND THE NEXT MOMENT FOUR OF THE EIGHT BOILERS EXPLODED WITH A
THUNDEROUS CRASH AND THE WHOLE FORWARD THIRD OF THE BOAT WAS HOISTED
TOWARD THE SKY THE MAIN PART OF THE MASS WITH THE CHIMNEYS DROPPED
UPON THE BOAT AGAIN A MOUNTAIN OF RIDDLED AND CHAOTIC RUBBISH AND
THEN AFTER A LITTLE FIRE BROKE OUT
MANY PEOPLE WERE FLUNG TO CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES AND FELL IN THE
RIVER AMONG THESE WERE MR
WOOD AND MY BROTHER AND THE CARPENTER
THE
CARPENTER WAS STILL STRETCHED UPON HIS MATTRESS WHEN HE STRUCK THE WATER
SEVENTY FIVE FEET FROM THE BOAT
BROWN THE PILOT AND GEORGE BLACK
CHIEF CLERK WERE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF AFTER THE EXPLOSION
THE
BARBER'S CHAIR WITH CAPTAIN KLINEFELTER IN IT AND UNHURT WAS LEFT WITH
ITS BACK OVERHANGING VACANCY EVERYTHING FORWARD OF IT FLOOR AND ALL
HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE STUPEFIED BARBER WHO WAS ALSO UNHURT
STOOD WITH ONE TOE PROJECTING OVER SPACE STILL STIRRING HIS LATHER
UNCONSCIOUSLY AND SAYING NOT A WORD
WHEN GEORGE EALER SAW THE CHIMNEYS PLUNGING ALOFT IN FRONT OF HIM HE
KNEW WHAT THE MATTER WAS SO HE MUFFLED HIS FACE IN THE LAPELS OF HIS
COAT AND PRESSED BOTH HANDS THERE TIGHTLY TO KEEP THIS PROTECTION IN
ITS PLACE SO THAT NO STEAM COULD GET TO HIS NOSE OR MOUTH
HE HAD AMPLE
TIME TO ATTEND TO THESE DETAILS WHILE HE WAS GOING UP AND RETURNING
HE
PRESENTLY LANDED ON TOP OF THE UNEXPLODED BOILERS FORTY FEET BELOW THE
FORMER PILOT HOUSE ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHEEL AND A RAIN OF OTHER STUFF
AND ENVELOPED IN A CLOUD OF SCALDING STEAM
ALL OF THE MANY WHO BREATHED
THAT STEAM DIED NONE ESCAPED
BUT EALER BREATHED NONE OF IT
HE MADE
HIS WAY TO THE FREE AIR AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND WHEN THE STEAM
CLEARED AWAY HE RETURNED AND CLIMBED UP ON THE BOILERS AGAIN AND
PATIENTLY HUNTED OUT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF HIS CHESSMEN AND THE SEVERAL
JOINTS OF HIS FLUTE
BY THIS TIME THE FIRE WAS BEGINNING TO THREATEN
SHRIEKS AND GROANS
FILLED THE AIR
A GREAT MANY PERSONS HAD BEEN SCALDED A GREAT MANY
CRIPPLED THE EXPLOSION HAD DRIVEN AN IRON CROWBAR THROUGH ONE MAN'S
BODY I THINK THEY SAID HE WAS A PRIEST
HE DID NOT DIE AT ONCE AND HIS
SUFFERINGS WERE VERY DREADFUL
A YOUNG FRENCH NAVAL CADET OF FIFTEEN
SON OF A FRENCH ADMIRAL WAS FEARFULLY SCALDED BUT BORE HIS TORTURES
MANFULLY
BOTH MATES WERE BADLY SCALDED BUT THEY STOOD TO THEIR POSTS
NEVERTHELESS
THEY DREW THE WOOD BOAT AFT AND THEY AND THE CAPTAIN
FOUGHT BACK THE FRANTIC HERD OF FRIGHTENED IMMIGRANTS TILL THE WOUNDED
COULD BE BROUGHT THERE AND PLACED IN SAFETY FIRST
WHEN MR
WOOD AND HENRY FELL IN THE WATER THEY STRUCK OUT FOR SHORE
WHICH WAS ONLY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY BUT HENRY PRESENTLY SAID HE
BELIEVED HE WAS NOT HURT WHAT AN UNACCOUNTABLE ERROR AND THEREFORE
WOULD SWIM BACK TO THE BOAT AND HELP SAVE THE WOUNDED
SO THEY PARTED
AND HENRY RETURNED
BY THIS TIME THE FIRE WAS MAKING FIERCE HEADWAY AND SEVERAL PERSONS
WHO WERE IMPRISONED UNDER THE RUINS WERE BEGGING PITEOUSLY FOR HELP
ALL EFFORTS TO CONQUER THE FIRE PROVED FRUITLESS SO THE BUCKETS WERE
PRESENTLY THROWN ASIDE AND THE OFFICERS FELL TO WITH AXES AND TRIED TO
CUT THE PRISONERS OUT
A STRIKER WAS ONE OF THE CAPTIVES HE SAID HE WAS
NOT INJURED BUT COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF AND WHEN HE SAW THAT THE FIRE
WAS LIKELY TO DRIVE AWAY THE WORKERS HE BEGGED THAT SOME ONE WOULD
SHOOT HIM AND THUS SAVE HIM FROM THE MORE DREADFUL DEATH
THE FIRE DID
DRIVE THE AXMEN AWAY AND THEY HAD TO LISTEN HELPLESS TO THIS POOR
FELLOW'S SUPPLICATIONS TILL THE FLAMES ENDED HIS MISERIES
THE FIRE DROVE ALL INTO THE WOOD FLAT THAT COULD BE ACCOMMODATED THERE
IT WAS CUT ADRIFT THEN AND IT AND THE BURNING STEAMER FLOATED DOWN
THE RIVER TOWARD SHIP ISLAND
THEY MOORED THE FLAT AT THE HEAD OF THE
ISLAND AND THERE UNSHELTERED FROM THE BLAZING SUN THE HALF NAKED
OCCUPANTS HAD TO REMAIN WITHOUT FOOD OR STIMULANTS OR HELP FOR THEIR
HURTS DURING THE REST OF THE DAY
A STEAMER CAME ALONG FINALLY
AND CARRIED THE UNFORTUNATES TO MEMPHIS AND THERE THE MOST LAVISH
ASSISTANCE WAS AT ONCE FORTHCOMING
BY THIS TIME HENRY WAS INSENSIBLE
THE PHYSICIANS EXAMINED HIS INJURIES AND SAW THAT THEY WERE FATAL AND
NATURALLY TURNED THEIR MAIN ATTENTION TO PATIENTS WHO COULD BE SAVED
FORTY OF THE WOUNDED WERE PLACED UPON PALLETS ON THE FLOOR OF A GREAT
PUBLIC HALL AND AMONG THESE WAS HENRY
THERE THE LADIES OF MEMPHIS
CAME EVERY DAY WITH FLOWERS FRUITS AND DAINTIES AND DELICACIES OF
ALL KINDS AND THERE THEY REMAINED AND NURSED THE WOUNDED
ALL THE
PHYSICIANS STOOD WATCHES THERE AND ALL THE MEDICAL STUDENTS AND THE
REST OF THE TOWN FURNISHED MONEY OR WHATEVER ELSE WAS WANTED
AND
MEMPHIS KNEW HOW TO DO ALL THESE THINGS WELL FOR MANY A DISASTER
LIKE THE 'PENNSYLVANIA'S' HAD HAPPENED NEAR HER DOORS AND SHE WAS
EXPERIENCED ABOVE ALL OTHER CITIES ON THE RIVER IN THE GRACIOUS OFFICE
OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN
THE SIGHT I SAW WHEN I ENTERED THAT LARGE HALL WAS NEW AND STRANGE TO
ME
TWO LONG ROWS OF PROSTRATE FORMS MORE THAN FORTY IN ALL AND EVERY
FACE AND HEAD A SHAPELESS WAD OF LOOSE RAW COTTON
IT WAS A GRUESOME
SPECTACLE
I WATCHED THERE SIX DAYS AND NIGHTS AND A VERY MELANCHOLY
EXPERIENCE IT WAS
THERE WAS ONE DAILY INCIDENT WHICH WAS PECULIARLY
DEPRESSING THIS WAS THE REMOVAL OF THE DOOMED TO A CHAMBER APART
IT
WAS DONE IN ORDER THAT THE MORALE OF THE OTHER PATIENTS MIGHT NOT BE
INJURIOUSLY AFFECTED BY SEEING ONE OF THEIR NUMBER IN THE DEATH AGONY
THE FATED ONE WAS ALWAYS CARRIED OUT WITH AS LITTLE STIR AS POSSIBLE
AND THE STRETCHER WAS ALWAYS HIDDEN FROM SIGHT BY A WALL OF ASSISTANTS
BUT NO MATTER EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT THAT CLUSTER OF BENT FORMS WITH
ITS MUFFLED STEP AND ITS SLOW MOVEMENT MEANT AND ALL EYES WATCHED IT
WISTFULLY AND A SHUDDER WENT ABREAST OF IT LIKE A WAVE
I SAW MANY POOR FELLOWS REMOVED TO THE 'DEATH ROOM AND SAW THEM NO
MORE AFTERWARD
BUT I SAW OUR CHIEF MATE CARRIED THITHER MORE THAN
ONCE
HIS HURTS WERE FRIGHTFUL ESPECIALLY HIS SCALDS
HE WAS CLOTHED IN
LINSEED OIL AND RAW COTTON TO HIS WAIST AND RESEMBLED NOTHING HUMAN
HE WAS OFTEN OUT OF HIS MIND AND THEN HIS PAINS WOULD MAKE HIM RAVE AND
SHOUT AND SOMETIMES SHRIEK
THEN AFTER A PERIOD OF DUMB EXHAUSTION HIS
DISORDERED IMAGINATION WOULD SUDDENLY TRANSFORM THE GREAT APARTMENT INTO
A FORECASTLE AND THE HURRYING THRONG OF NURSES INTO THE CREW AND
HE WOULD COME TO A SITTING POSTURE AND SHOUT 'HUMP YOURSELVES HUMP
YOURSELVES YOU PETRIFACTIONS SNAIL BELLIES PALL BEARERS GOING TO
BE ALL DAY GETTING THAT HATFUL OF FREIGHT OUT AND SUPPLEMENT THIS
EXPLOSION WITH A FIRMAMENT OBLITERATING IRRUPTION OR PROFANITY WHICH
NOTHING COULD STAY OR STOP TILL HIS CRATER WAS EMPTY
AND NOW AND THEN
WHILE THESE FRENZIES POSSESSED HIM HE WOULD TEAR OFF HANDFULS OF THE
COTTON AND EXPOSE HIS COOKED FLESH TO VIEW
IT WAS HORRIBLE
IT WAS
BAD FOR THE OTHERS OF COURSE THIS NOISE AND THESE EXHIBITIONS SO THE
DOCTORS TRIED TO GIVE HIM MORPHINE TO QUIET HIM
BUT IN HIS MIND OR OUT
OF IT HE WOULD NOT TAKE IT
HE SAID HIS WIFE HAD BEEN KILLED BY THAT
TREACHEROUS DRUG AND HE WOULD DIE BEFORE HE WOULD TAKE IT
HE SUSPECTED
THAT THE DOCTORS WERE CONCEALING IT IN HIS ORDINARY MEDICINES AND IN HIS
WATER SO HE CEASED FROM PUTTING EITHER TO HIS LIPS
ONCE WHEN HE HAD
BEEN WITHOUT WATER DURING TWO SWELTERING DAYS HE TOOK THE DIPPER IN HIS
HAND AND THE SIGHT OF THE LIMPID FLUID AND THE MISERY OF HIS THIRST
TEMPTED HIM ALMOST BEYOND HIS STRENGTH BUT HE MASTERED HIMSELF AND
THREW IT AWAY AND AFTER THAT HE ALLOWED NO MORE TO BE BROUGHT NEAR HIM
THREE TIMES I SAW HIM CARRIED TO THE DEATH ROOM INSENSIBLE AND SUPPOSED
TO BE DYING BUT EACH TIME HE REVIVED CURSED HIS ATTENDANTS AND
DEMANDED TO BE TAKEN BACK
HE LIVED TO BE MATE OF A STEAMBOAT AGAIN
BUT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WENT TO THE DEATH ROOM AND RETURNED ALIVE
DR
PEYTON A PRINCIPAL PHYSICIAN AND RICH IN ALL THE ATTRIBUTES THAT
GO TO CONSTITUTE HIGH AND FLAWLESS CHARACTER DID ALL THAT EDUCATED
JUDGMENT AND TRAINED SKILL COULD DO FOR HENRY BUT AS THE NEWSPAPERS
HAD SAID IN THE BEGINNING HIS HURTS WERE PAST HELP
ON THE EVENING OF
THE SIXTH DAY HIS WANDERING MIND BUSIED ITSELF WITH MATTERS FAR AWAY
AND HIS NERVELESS FINGERS 'PICKED AT HIS COVERLET HIS HOUR HAD STRUCK
WE BORE HIM TO THE DEATH ROOM POOR BOY
CHAPTER 21
A SECTION IN MY BIOGRAPHY
IN DUE COURSE I GOT MY LICENSE
I WAS A PILOT NOW FULL FLEDGED
I
DROPPED INTO CASUAL EMPLOYMENTS NO MISFORTUNES RESULTING INTERMITTENT
WORK GAVE PLACE TO STEADY AND PROTRACTED ENGAGEMENTS
TIME DRIFTED
SMOOTHLY AND PROSPEROUSLY ON AND I SUPPOSED AND HOPED THAT I WAS
GOING TO FOLLOW THE RIVER THE REST OF MY DAYS AND DIE AT THE WHEEL
WHEN MY MISSION WAS ENDED
BUT BY AND BY THE WAR CAME COMMERCE WAS
SUSPENDED MY OCCUPATION WAS GONE
I HAD TO SEEK ANOTHER LIVELIHOOD
SO I BECAME A SILVER MINER IN NEVADA
NEXT A NEWSPAPER REPORTER NEXT A GOLD MINER IN CALIFORNIA NEXT A
REPORTER IN SAN FRANCISCO NEXT A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN THE SANDWICH
ISLANDS NEXT A ROVING CORRESPONDENT IN EUROPE AND THE EAST NEXT
AN INSTRUCTIONAL TORCH BEARER ON THE LECTURE PLATFORM AND FINALLY I
BECAME A SCRIBBLER OF BOOKS AND AN IMMOVABLE FIXTURE AMONG THE OTHER
ROCKS OF NEW ENGLAND
IN SO FEW WORDS HAVE I DISPOSED OF THE TWENTY ONE SLOW DRIFTING YEARS
THAT HAVE COME AND GONE SINCE I LAST LOOKED FROM THE WINDOWS OF A
PILOT HOUSE
LET US RESUME NOW
CHAPTER 22
I RETURN TO MY MUTTONS
AFTER TWENTY ONE YEARS' ABSENCE I FELT A VERY STRONG DESIRE TO SEE THE
RIVER AGAIN AND THE STEAMBOATS AND SUCH OF THE BOYS AS MIGHT BE LEFT
SO I RESOLVED TO GO OUT THERE
I ENLISTED A POET FOR COMPANY AND A
STENOGRAPHER TO 'TAKE HIM DOWN AND STARTED WESTWARD ABOUT THE MIDDLE
OF APRIL
AS I PROPOSED TO MAKE NOTES WITH A VIEW TO PRINTING I TOOK SOME
THOUGHT AS TO METHODS OF PROCEDURE
I REFLECTED THAT IF I WERE
RECOGNIZED ON THE RIVER I SHOULD NOT BE AS FREE TO GO AND COME TALK
INQUIRE AND SPY AROUND AS I SHOULD BE IF UNKNOWN I REMEMBERED THAT IT
WAS THE CUSTOM OF STEAMBOATMEN IN THE OLD TIMES TO LOAD UP THE CONFIDING
STRANGER WITH THE MOST PICTURESQUE AND ADMIRABLE LIES AND PUT
THE SOPHISTICATED FRIEND OFF WITH DULL AND INEFFECTUAL FACTS SO I
CONCLUDED THAT FROM A BUSINESS POINT OF VIEW IT WOULD BE AN ADVANTAGE
TO DISGUISE OUR PARTY WITH FICTITIOUS NAMES
THE IDEA WAS CERTAINLY
GOOD BUT IT BRED INFINITE BOTHER FOR ALTHOUGH SMITH JONES AND
JOHNSON ARE EASY NAMES TO REMEMBER WHEN THERE IS NO OCCASION TO REMEMBER
THEM IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOLLECT THEM WHEN THEY ARE WANTED
HOW DO CRIMINALS MANAGE TO KEEP A BRAND NEW ALIAS IN MIND THIS IS A
GREAT MYSTERY
I WAS INNOCENT AND YET WAS SELDOM ABLE TO LAY MY HAND ON
MY NEW NAME WHEN IT WAS NEEDED AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IF I HAD HAD
A CRIME ON MY CONSCIENCE TO FURTHER CONFUSE ME I COULD NEVER HAVE KEPT
THE NAME BY ME AT ALL
WE LEFT PER PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD AT 8 A M
APRIL 18
'EVENING
SPEAKING OF DRESS
GRACE AND PICTURESQUENESS DROP GRADUALLY
OUT OF IT AS ONE TRAVELS AWAY FROM NEW YORK
I FIND THAT AMONG MY NOTES
IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHICH DIRECTION YOU
TAKE THE FACT REMAINS THE SAME
WHETHER YOU MOVE NORTH SOUTH EAST
OR WEST NO MATTER YOU CAN GET UP IN THE MORNING AND GUESS HOW FAR YOU
HAVE COME BY NOTING WHAT DEGREE OF GRACE AND PICTURESQUENESS IS BY THAT
TIME LACKING IN THE COSTUMES OF THE NEW PASSENGERS I DO NOT MEAN OF
THE WOMEN ALONE BUT OF BOTH SEXES
IT MAY BE THAT CARRIAGE IS AT THE
BOTTOM OF THIS THING AND I THINK IT IS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN IN THE PROVINCIAL CITIES WHOSE GARMENTS ARE ALL MADE
BY THE BEST TAILORS AND DRESSMAKERS OF NEW YORK YET THIS HAS NO
PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT UPON THE GRAND FACT THE EDUCATED EYE NEVER MISTAKES
THOSE PEOPLE FOR NEW YORKERS
NO THERE IS A GODLESS GRACE AND SNAP
AND STYLE ABOUT A BORN AND BRED NEW YORKER WHICH MERE CLOTHING CANNOT
EFFECT
'APRIL 19
THIS MORNING STRUCK INTO THE REGION OF FULL
GOATEES SOMETIMES ACCOMPANIED BY A MUSTACHE BUT ONLY OCCASIONALLY
IT WAS ODD TO COME UPON THIS THICK CROP OF AN OBSOLETE AND UNCOMELY
FASHION IT WAS LIKE RUNNING SUDDENLY ACROSS A FORGOTTEN ACQUAINTANCE
WHOM YOU HAD SUPPOSED DEAD FOR A GENERATION
THE GOATEE EXTENDS OVER
A WIDE EXTENT OF COUNTRY AND IS ACCOMPANIED BY AN IRON CLAD BELIEF IN
ADAM AND THE BIBLICAL HISTORY OF CREATION WHICH HAS NOT SUFFERED FROM
THE ASSAULTS OF THE SCIENTISTS
'AFTERNOON
AT THE RAILWAY STATIONS THE LOAFERS CARRY BOTH HANDS IN
THEIR BREECHES POCKETS IT WAS OBSERVABLE HERETOFORE THAT ONE HAND
WAS SOMETIMES OUT OF DOORS HERE NEVER
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FACT IN
GEOGRAPHY
IF THE LOAFERS DETERMINED THE CHARACTER OF A COUNTRY IT WOULD BE STILL
MORE IMPORTANT OF COURSE
'HERETOFORE ALL ALONG THE STATION LOAFER HAS BEEN OFTEN OBSERVED TO
SCRATCH ONE SHIN WITH THE OTHER FOOT HERE THESE REMAINS OF ACTIVITY
ARE WANTING
THIS HAS AN OMINOUS LOOK
BY AND BY WE ENTERED THE TOBACCO CHEWING REGION
FIFTY YEARS AGO THE
TOBACCO CHEWING REGION COVERED THE UNION
IT IS GREATLY RESTRICTED NOW
NEXT BOOTS BEGAN TO APPEAR
NOT IN STRONG FORCE HOWEVER
LATER AWAY
DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI THEY BECAME THE RULE
THEY DISAPPEARED FROM OTHER
SECTIONS OF THE UNION WITH THE MUD NO DOUBT THEY WILL DISAPPEAR FROM
THE RIVER VILLAGES ALSO WHEN PROPER PAVEMENTS COME IN
WE REACHED ST
LOUIS AT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
AT THE COUNTER OF THE
HOTEL I TENDERED A HURRIEDLY INVENTED FICTITIOUS NAME WITH A MISERABLE
ATTEMPT AT CARELESS EASE
THE CLERK PAUSED AND INSPECTED ME IN THE
COMPASSIONATE WAY IN WHICH ONE INSPECTS A RESPECTABLE PERSON WHO IS
FOUND IN DOUBTFUL CIRCUMSTANCES THEN HE SAID
'IT'S ALL RIGHT I KNOW WHAT SORT OF A ROOM YOU WANT
USED TO CLERK AT
THE ST
JAMES IN NEW YORK
AN UNPROMISING BEGINNING FOR A FRAUDULENT CAREER
WE STARTED TO THE
SUPPER ROOM AND MET TWO OTHER MEN WHOM I HAD KNOWN ELSEWHERE
HOW ODD
AND UNFAIR IT IS WICKED IMPOSTORS GO AROUND LECTURING UNDER MY NOM
DE GUERRE AND NOBODY SUSPECTS THEM BUT WHEN AN HONEST MAN ATTEMPTS AN
IMPOSTURE HE IS EXPOSED AT ONCE
ONE THING SEEMED PLAIN WE MUST START DOWN THE RIVER THE NEXT DAY IF
PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT BE DECEIVED WERE GOING TO CROP UP AT THIS RATE
AN UNPALATABLE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR WE HAD HOPED TO HAVE A WEEK IN
ST
LOUIS
THE SOUTHERN WAS A GOOD HOTEL AND WE COULD HAVE HAD A
COMFORTABLE TIME THERE
IT IS LARGE AND WELL CONDUCTED AND ITS
DECORATIONS DO NOT MAKE ONE CRY AS DO THOSE OF THE VAST PALMER HOUSE
IN CHICAGO
TRUE THE BILLIARD TABLES WERE OF THE OLD SILURIAN PERIOD
AND THE CUES AND BALLS OF THE POST PLIOCENE BUT THERE WAS REFRESHMENT
IN THIS NOT DISCOMFORT FOR THERE IS REST AND HEALING IN THE
CONTEMPLATION OF ANTIQUITIES
THE MOST NOTABLE ABSENCE OBSERVABLE IN THE BILLIARD ROOM WAS THE
ABSENCE OF THE RIVER MAN
IF HE WAS THERE HE HAD TAKEN IN HIS SIGN
HE WAS IN DISGUISE
I SAW THERE NONE OF THE SWELL AIRS AND GRACES AND
OSTENTATIOUS DISPLAYS OF MONEY AND POMPOUS SQUANDERINGS OF IT WHICH
USED TO DISTINGUISH THE STEAMBOAT CROWD FROM THE DRY LAND CROWD IN
THE BYGONE DAYS IN THE THRONGED BILLIARD ROOMS OF ST
LOUIS
IN THOSE
TIMES THE PRINCIPAL SALOONS WERE ALWAYS POPULOUS WITH RIVER MEN GIVEN
FIFTY PLAYERS PRESENT THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE WERE LIKELY TO BE FROM
THE RIVER
BUT I SUSPECTED THAT THE RANKS WERE THIN NOW AND THE
STEAMBOATMEN NO LONGER AN ARISTOCRACY
WHY IN MY TIME THEY USED TO
CALL THE 'BARKEEP' BILL OR JOE OR TOM AND SLAP HIM ON THE SHOULDER
I WATCHED FOR THAT
BUT NONE OF THESE PEOPLE DID IT
MANIFESTLY A GLORY
THAT ONCE WAS HAD DISSOLVED AND VANISHED AWAY IN THESE TWENTY ONE YEARS
WHEN I WENT UP TO MY ROOM I FOUND THERE THE YOUNG MAN CALLED ROGERS
CRYING
ROGERS WAS NOT HIS NAME NEITHER WAS JONES BROWN DEXTER
FERGUSON BASCOM NOR THOMPSON BUT HE ANSWERED TO EITHER OF THESE THAT
A BODY FOUND HANDY IN AN EMERGENCY OR TO ANY OTHER NAME IN FACT IF HE
PERCEIVED THAT YOU MEANT HIM
HE SAID
'WHAT IS A PERSON TO DO HERE WHEN HE WANTS A DRINK OF WATER DRINK THIS
SLUSH
'CAN'T YOU DRINK IT
'I COULD IF I HAD SOME OTHER WATER TO WASH IT WITH
HERE WAS A THING WHICH HAD NOT CHANGED A SCORE OF YEARS HAD NOT
AFFECTED THIS WATER'S MULATTO COMPLEXION IN THE LEAST A SCORE OF
CENTURIES WOULD SUCCEED NO BETTER PERHAPS
IT COMES OUT OF THE
TURBULENT BANK CAVING MISSOURI AND EVERY TUMBLERFUL OF IT HOLDS NEARLY
AN ACRE OF LAND IN SOLUTION
I GOT THIS FACT FROM THE BISHOP OF THE
DIOCESE
IF YOU WILL LET YOUR GLASS STAND HALF AN HOUR YOU CAN SEPARATE
THE LAND FROM THE WATER AS EASY AS GENESIS AND THEN YOU WILL FIND THEM
BOTH GOOD THE ONE GOOD TO EAT THE OTHER GOOD TO DRINK
THE LAND IS
VERY NOURISHING THE WATER IS THOROUGHLY WHOLESOME
THE ONE APPEASES
HUNGER THE OTHER THIRST
BUT THE NATIVES DO NOT TAKE THEM SEPARATELY
BUT TOGETHER AS NATURE MIXED THEM
WHEN THEY FIND AN INCH OF MUD IN THE
BOTTOM OF A GLASS THEY STIR IT UP AND THEN TAKE THE DRAUGHT AS THEY
WOULD GRUEL
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A STRANGER TO GET USED TO THIS BATTER
BUT ONCE USED TO IT HE WILL PREFER IT TO WATER
THIS IS REALLY THE CASE
IT IS GOOD FOR STEAMBOATING AND GOOD TO DRINK BUT IT IS WORTHLESS FOR
ALL OTHER PURPOSES EXCEPT BAPTIZING
NEXT MORNING WE DROVE AROUND TOWN IN THE RAIN
THE CITY SEEMED BUT
LITTLE CHANGED
IT WAS GREATLY CHANGED BUT IT DID NOT SEEM SO
BECAUSE IN ST
LOUIS AS IN LONDON AND PITTSBURGH YOU CAN'T PERSUADE
A NEW THING TO LOOK NEW THE COAL SMOKE TURNS IT INTO AN ANTIQUITY THE
MOMENT YOU TAKE YOUR HAND OFF IT
THE PLACE HAD JUST ABOUT DOUBLED ITS
SIZE SINCE I WAS A RESIDENT OF IT AND WAS NOW BECOME A CITY OF 400 000
INHABITANTS STILL IN THE SOLID BUSINESS PARTS IT LOOKED ABOUT AS IT
HAD LOOKED FORMERLY
YET I AM SURE THERE IS NOT AS MUCH SMOKE IN ST
LOUIS NOW AS THERE USED TO BE
THE SMOKE USED TO BANK ITSELF IN A DENSE
BILLOWY BLACK CANOPY OVER THE TOWN AND HIDE THE SKY FROM VIEW
THIS
SHELTER IS VERY MUCH THINNER NOW STILL THERE IS A SUFFICIENCY OF SMOKE
THERE I THINK
I HEARD NO COMPLAINT
HOWEVER ON THE OUTSKIRTS CHANGES WERE APPARENT ENOUGH NOTABLY IN
DWELLING HOUSE ARCHITECTURE
THE FINE NEW HOMES ARE NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL
AND MODERN
THEY STAND BY THEMSELVES TOO WITH GREEN LAWNS AROUND THEM
WHEREAS THE DWELLINGS OF A FORMER DAY ARE PACKED TOGETHER IN BLOCKS
AND ARE ALL OF ONE PATTERN WITH WINDOWS ALL ALIKE SET IN AN ARCHED
FRAME WORK OF TWISTED STONE A SORT OF HOUSE WHICH WAS HANDSOME ENOUGH
WHEN IT WAS RARER
THERE WAS ANOTHER CHANGE THE FOREST PARK
THIS WAS NEW TO ME
IT IS
BEAUTIFUL AND VERY EXTENSIVE AND HAS THE EXCELLENT MERIT OF HAVING BEEN
MADE MAINLY BY NATURE
THERE ARE OTHER PARKS AND FINE ONES NOTABLY
TOWER GROVE AND THE BOTANICAL GARDENS FOR ST
LOUIS INTERESTED HERSELF
IN SUCH IMPROVEMENTS AT AN EARLIER DAY THAN DID THE MOST OF OUR CITIES
THE FIRST TIME I EVER SAW ST
LOUIS I COULD HAVE BOUGHT IT FOR SIX
MILLION DOLLARS AND IT WAS THE MISTAKE OF MY LIFE THAT I DID NOT DO
IT
IT WAS BITTER NOW TO LOOK ABROAD OVER THIS DOMED AND STEEPLED
METROPOLIS THIS SOLID EXPANSE OF BRICKS AND MORTAR STRETCHING AWAY ON
EVERY HAND INTO DIM MEASURE DEFYING DISTANCES AND REMEMBER THAT I HAD
ALLOWED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GO BY
WHY I SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED IT TO GO
BY SEEMS OF COURSE FOOLISH AND INEXPLICABLE TO DAY AT A FIRST GLANCE
YET THERE WERE REASONS AT THE TIME TO JUSTIFY THIS COURSE
A SCOTCHMAN HON
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MURRAY WRITING SOME FORTY FIVE
OR FIFTY YEARS AGO SAID 'THE STREETS ARE NARROW ILL PAVED AND ILL
LIGHTED THOSE STREETS ARE NARROW STILL OF COURSE MANY OF THEM ARE
ILL PAVED YET BUT THE REPROACH OF ILL LIGHTING CANNOT BE REPEATED NOW
THE 'CATHOLIC NEW CHURCH' WAS THE ONLY NOTABLE BUILDING THEN AND MR
MURRAY WAS CONFIDENTLY CALLED UPON TO ADMIRE IT WITH ITS 'SPECIES OF
GRECIAN PORTICO SURMOUNTED BY A KIND OF STEEPLE MUCH TOO DIMINUTIVE
IN ITS PROPORTIONS AND SURMOUNTED BY SUNDRY ORNAMENTS' WHICH THE
UNIMAGINATIVE SCOTCHMAN FOUND HIMSELF 'QUITE UNABLE TO DESCRIBE AND
THEREFORE WAS GRATEFUL WHEN A GERMAN TOURIST HELPED HIM OUT WITH THE
EXCLAMATION 'BY THEY LOOK EXACTLY LIKE BED POSTS ST
LOUIS IS
WELL EQUIPPED WITH STATELY AND NOBLE PUBLIC BUILDINGS NOW AND THE
LITTLE CHURCH WHICH THE PEOPLE USED TO BE SO PROUD OF LOST ITS
IMPORTANCE A LONG TIME AGO
STILL THIS WOULD NOT SURPRISE MR
MURRAY
IF HE COULD COME BACK FOR HE PROPHESIED THE COMING GREATNESS OF ST
LOUIS WITH STRONG CONFIDENCE
THE FURTHER WE DROVE IN OUR INSPECTION TOUR THE MORE SENSIBLY I
REALIZED HOW THE CITY HAD GROWN SINCE I HAD SEEN IT LAST CHANGES IN
DETAIL BECAME STEADILY MORE APPARENT AND FREQUENT THAN AT FIRST TOO
CHANGES UNIFORMLY EVIDENCING PROGRESS ENERGY PROSPERITY
BUT THE CHANGE OF CHANGES WAS ON THE 'LEVEE THIS TIME A DEPARTURE
FROM THE RULE
HALF A DOZEN SOUND ASLEEP STEAMBOATS WHERE I USED TO SEE
A SOLID MILE OF WIDE AWAKE ONES THIS WAS MELANCHOLY THIS WAS
WOEFUL
THE ABSENCE OF THE PERVADING AND JOCUND STEAMBOATMAN FROM THE
BILLIARD SALOON WAS EXPLAINED
HE WAS ABSENT BECAUSE HE IS NO MORE
HIS
OCCUPATION IS GONE HIS POWER HAS PASSED AWAY HE IS ABSORBED INTO THE
COMMON HERD HE GRINDS AT THE MILL A SHORN SAMSON AND INCONSPICUOUS
HALF A DOZEN LIFELESS STEAMBOATS A MILE OF EMPTY WHARVES A NEGRO
FATIGUED WITH WHISKEY STRETCHED ASLEEP IN A WIDE AND SOUNDLESS VACANCY
WHERE THE SERRIED HOSTS OF COMMERCE USED TO CONTEND FOOTNOTE CAPT
MARRYAT WRITING FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO SAYS 'ST
LOUIS HAS 20 000
INHABITANTS
THE RIVER ABREAST OF THE TOWN IS CROWDED WITH STEAMBOATS
LYING IN TWO OR THREE TIERS HERE WAS DESOLATION INDEED
'THE OLD OLD SEA AS ONE IN TEARS COMES MURMURING WITH FOAMY LIPS
AND KNOCKING AT THE VACANT PIERS CALLS FOR HIS LONG LOST MULTITUDE OF
SHIPS
THE TOWBOAT AND THE RAILROAD HAD DONE THEIR WORK AND DONE IT WELL AND
COMPLETELY
THE MIGHTY BRIDGE STRETCHING ALONG OVER OUR HEADS HAD
DONE ITS SHARE IN THE SLAUGHTER AND SPOLIATION
REMAINS OF FORMER
STEAMBOATMEN TOLD ME WITH WAN SATISFACTION THAT THE BRIDGE DOESN'T
PAY
STILL IT CAN BE NO SUFFICIENT COMPENSATION TO A CORPSE TO KNOW
THAT THE DYNAMITE THAT LAID HIM OUT WAS NOT OF AS GOOD QUALITY AS IT HAD
BEEN SUPPOSED TO BE
THE PAVEMENTS ALONG THE RIVER FRONT WERE BAD THE SIDEWALKS WERE RATHER
OUT OF REPAIR THERE WAS A RICH ABUNDANCE OF MUD
ALL THIS WAS FAMILIAR
AND SATISFYING BUT THE ANCIENT ARMIES OF DRAYS AND STRUGGLING THRONGS
OF MEN AND MOUNTAINS OF FREIGHT WERE GONE AND SABBATH REIGNED IN
THEIR STEAD
THE IMMEMORIAL MILE OF CHEAP FOUL DOGGERIES REMAINED BUT
BUSINESS WAS DULL WITH THEM THE MULTITUDES OF POISON SWILLING IRISHMEN
HAD DEPARTED AND IN THEIR PLACES WERE A FEW SCATTERING HANDFULS OF
RAGGED NEGROES SOME DRINKING SOME DRUNK SOME NODDING OTHERS
ASLEEP
ST
LOUIS IS A GREAT AND PROSPEROUS AND ADVANCING CITY BUT THE
RIVER EDGE OF IT SEEMS DEAD PAST RESURRECTION
MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOATING WAS BORN ABOUT 1812 AT THE END OF THIRTY
YEARS IT HAD GROWN TO MIGHTY PROPORTIONS AND IN LESS THAN THIRTY
MORE IT WAS DEAD A STRANGELY SHORT LIFE FOR SO MAJESTIC A CREATURE
OF
COURSE IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY DEAD NEITHER IS A CRIPPLED OCTOGENARIAN WHO
COULD ONCE JUMP TWENTY TWO FEET ON LEVEL GROUND BUT AS CONTRASTED WITH
WHAT IT WAS IN ITS PRIME VIGOR MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOATING MAY BE CALLED
DEAD
IT KILLED THE OLD FASHIONED KEEL BOATING BY REDUCING THE FREIGHT TRIP
TO NEW ORLEANS TO LESS THAN A WEEK
THE RAILROADS HAVE KILLED THE
STEAMBOAT PASSENGER TRAFFIC BY DOING IN TWO OR THREE DAYS WHAT THE
STEAMBOATS CONSUMED A WEEK IN DOING AND THE TOWING FLEETS HAVE KILLED
THE THROUGH FREIGHT TRAFFIC BY DRAGGING SIX OR SEVEN STEAMER LOADS OF
STUFF DOWN THE RIVER AT A TIME AT AN EXPENSE SO TRIVIAL THAT STEAMBOAT
COMPETITION WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
FREIGHT AND PASSENGER WAY TRAFFIC REMAINS TO THE STEAMERS
THIS IS IN
THE HANDS ALONG THE TWO THOUSAND MILES OF RIVER BETWEEN ST
PAUL AND
NEW ORLEANS OF TWO OR THREE CLOSE CORPORATIONS WELL FORTIFIED WITH
CAPITAL AND BY ABLE AND THOROUGHLY BUSINESS LIKE MANAGEMENT AND SYSTEM
THESE MAKE A SUFFICIENCY OF MONEY OUT OF WHAT IS LEFT OF THE ONCE
PRODIGIOUS STEAMBOATING INDUSTRY
I SUPPOSE THAT ST
LOUIS AND NEW
ORLEANS HAVE NOT SUFFERED MATERIALLY BY THE CHANGE BUT ALAS FOR THE
WOOD YARD MAN
HE USED TO FRINGE THE RIVER ALL THE WAY HIS CLOSE RANKED MERCHANDISE
STRETCHED FROM THE ONE CITY TO THE OTHER ALONG THE BANKS AND HE SOLD
UNCOUNTABLE CORDS OF IT EVERY YEAR FOR CASH ON THE NAIL BUT ALL
THE SCATTERING BOATS THAT ARE LEFT BURN COAL NOW AND THE SELDOMEST
SPECTACLE ON THE MISSISSIPPI TO DAY IS A WOOD PILE
WHERE NOW IS THE
ONCE WOOD YARD MAN
CHAPTER 23
TRAVELING INCOGNITO
MY IDEA WAS TO TARRY A WHILE IN EVERY TOWN BETWEEN ST
LOUIS AND NEW
ORLEANS
TO DO THIS IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO GO FROM PLACE TO PLACE BY
THE SHORT PACKET LINES
IT WAS AN EASY PLAN TO MAKE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN
AN EASY ONE TO FOLLOW TWENTY YEARS AGO BUT NOT NOW
THERE ARE WIDE
INTERVALS BETWEEN BOATS THESE DAYS
I WANTED TO BEGIN WITH THE INTERESTING OLD FRENCH SETTLEMENTS OF ST
GENEVIEVE AND KASKASKIA SIXTY MILES BELOW ST
LOUIS
THERE WAS ONLY ONE
BOAT ADVERTISED FOR THAT SECTION A GRAND TOWER PACKET
STILL ONE
BOAT WAS ENOUGH SO WE WENT DOWN TO LOOK AT HER
SHE WAS A VENERABLE
RACK HEAP AND A FRAUD TO BOOT FOR SHE WAS PLAYING HERSELF FOR PERSONAL
PROPERTY WHEREAS THE GOOD HONEST DIRT WAS SO THICKLY CAKED ALL OVER HER
THAT SHE WAS RIGHTEOUSLY TAXABLE AS REAL ESTATE
THERE ARE PLACES IN
NEW ENGLAND WHERE HER HURRICANE DECK WOULD BE WORTH A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
DOLLARS AN ACRE
THE SOIL ON HER FORECASTLE WAS QUITE GOOD THE NEW CROP
OF WHEAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING FROM THE CRACKS IN PROTECTED PLACES
THE COMPANIONWAY WAS OF A DRY SANDY CHARACTER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL
SUITED FOR GRAPES WITH A SOUTHERN EXPOSURE AND A LITTLE SUBSOILING
THE
SOIL OF THE BOILER DECK WAS THIN AND ROCKY BUT GOOD ENOUGH FOR GRAZING
PURPOSES
A COLORED BOY WAS ON WATCH HERE NOBODY ELSE VISIBLE
WE
GATHERED FROM HIM THAT THIS CALM CRAFT WOULD GO AS ADVERTISED 'IF SHE
GOT HER TRIP IF SHE DIDN'T GET IT SHE WOULD WAIT FOR IT
'HAS SHE GOT ANY OF HER TRIP
'BLESS YOU NO BOSS
SHE AIN'T UNLOADENED YIT
SHE ONLY COME IN DIS
MAWNIN'
HE WAS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHEN SHE MIGHT GET HER TRIP BUT THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE TO MORROW OR MAYBE NEXT DAY
THIS WOULD NOT ANSWER AT ALL SO WE HAD
TO GIVE UP THE NOVELTY OF SAILING DOWN THE RIVER ON A FARM
WE HAD ONE
MORE ARROW IN OUR QUIVER A VICKSBURG PACKET THE 'GOLD DUST WAS TO
LEAVE AT 5 P M
WE TOOK PASSAGE IN HER FOR MEMPHIS AND GAVE UP THE IDEA
OF STOPPING OFF HERE AND THERE AS BEING IMPRACTICABLE
SHE WAS NEAT
CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE
WE CAMPED ON THE BOILER DECK AND BOUGHT SOME
CHEAP LITERATURE TO KILL TIME WITH
THE VENDER WAS A VENERABLE IRISHMAN
WITH A BENEVOLENT FACE AND A TONGUE THAT WORKED EASILY IN THE SOCKET
AND FROM HIM WE LEARNED THAT HE HAD LIVED IN ST
LOUIS THIRTY FOUR YEARS
AND HAD NEVER BEEN ACROSS THE RIVER DURING THAT PERIOD
THEN HE WANDERED
INTO A VERY FLOWING LECTURE FILLED WITH CLASSIC NAMES AND ALLUSIONS
WHICH WAS QUITE WONDERFUL FOR FLUENCY UNTIL THE FACT BECAME RATHER
APPARENT THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME NOR PERHAPS THE FIFTIETH
THAT THE SPEECH HAD BEEN DELIVERED
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF A CHARACTER
AND MUCH BETTER COMPANY THAN THE SAPPY LITERATURE HE WAS SELLING
A
RANDOM REMARK CONNECTING IRISHMEN AND BEER BROUGHT THIS NUGGET OF
INFORMATION OUT OF HIM
THEY DON'T DRINK IT SIR
THEY CAN'T DRINK IT SIR
GIVE AN IRISHMAN
LAGER FOR A MONTH AND HE'S A DEAD MAN
AN IRISHMAN IS LINED WITH
COPPER AND THE BEER CORRODES IT
BUT WHISKEY POLISHES THE COPPER AND IS
THE SAVING OF HIM SIR
AT EIGHT O'CLOCK PROMPTLY WE BACKED OUT AND CROSSED THE RIVER
AS WE
CREPT TOWARD THE SHORE IN THE THICK DARKNESS A BLINDING GLORY OF WHITE
ELECTRIC LIGHT BURST SUDDENLY FROM OUR FORECASTLE AND LIT UP THE
WATER AND THE WAREHOUSES AS WITH A NOON DAY GLARE
ANOTHER BIG
CHANGE THIS NO MORE FLICKERING SMOKY PITCH DRIPPING INEFFECTUAL
TORCH BASKETS NOW THEIR DAY IS PAST
NEXT INSTEAD OF CALLING OUT A
SCORE OF HANDS TO MAN THE STAGE A COUPLE OF MEN AND A HATFUL OF
STEAM LOWERED IT FROM THE DERRICK WHERE IT WAS SUSPENDED LAUNCHED IT
DEPOSITED IT IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOT AND THE WHOLE THING WAS OVER
AND DONE WITH BEFORE A MATE IN THE OLDEN TIME COULD HAVE GOT HIS
PROFANITY MILL ADJUSTED TO BEGIN THE PREPARATORY SERVICES
WHY THIS NEW
AND SIMPLE METHOD OF HANDLING THE STAGES WAS NOT THOUGHT OF WHEN THE
FIRST STEAMBOAT WAS BUILT IS A MYSTERY WHICH HELPS ONE TO REALIZE WHAT
A DULL WITTED SLUG THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING IS
WE FINALLY GOT AWAY AT TWO IN THE MORNING AND WHEN I TURNED OUT AT
SIX WE WERE ROUNDING TO AT A ROCKY POINT WHERE THERE WAS AN OLD
STONE WAREHOUSE AT ANY RATE THE RUINS OF IT TWO OR THREE DECAYED
DWELLING HOUSES WERE NEAR BY IN THE SHELTER OF THE LEAFY HILLS BUT
THERE WERE NO EVIDENCES OF HUMAN OR OTHER ANIMAL LIFE TO BE SEEN
I WONDERED IF I HAD FORGOTTEN THE RIVER FOR I HAD NO RECOLLECTION
WHATEVER OF THIS PLACE THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER TOO WAS UNFAMILIAR
THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT ANYWHERE THAT I COULD REMEMBER EVER HAVING
SEEN BEFORE
I WAS SURPRISED DISAPPOINTED AND ANNOYED
WE PUT ASHORE A WELL DRESSED LADY AND GENTLEMAN AND TWO WELL DRESSED
LADY LIKE YOUNG GIRLS TOGETHER WITH SUNDRY RUSSIA LEATHER BAGS
A
STRANGE PLACE FOR SUCH FOLK NO CARRIAGE WAS WAITING
THE PARTY MOVED
OFF AS IF THEY HAD NOT EXPECTED ANY AND STRUCK DOWN A WINDING COUNTRY
ROAD AFOOT
BUT THE MYSTERY WAS EXPLAINED WHEN WE GOT UNDER WAY AGAIN FOR THESE
PEOPLE WERE EVIDENTLY BOUND FOR A LARGE TOWN WHICH LAY SHUT IN BEHIND
A TOW HEAD I E NEW ISLAND A COUPLE OF MILES BELOW THIS LANDING
I COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT TOWN I COULDN'T PLACE IT COULDN'T CALL ITS
NAME
SO I LOST PART OF MY TEMPER
I SUSPECTED THAT IT MIGHT BE ST
GENEVIEVE AND SO IT PROVED TO BE
OBSERVE WHAT THIS ECCENTRIC RIVER HAD
BEEN ABOUT IT HAD BUILT UP THIS HUGE USELESS TOW HEAD DIRECTLY IN
FRONT OF THIS TOWN CUT OFF ITS RIVER COMMUNICATIONS FENCED IT AWAY
COMPLETELY AND MADE A 'COUNTRY' TOWN OF IT
IT IS A FINE OLD PLACE
TOO AND DESERVED A BETTER FATE
IT WAS SETTLED BY THE FRENCH AND IS A
RELIC OF A TIME WHEN ONE COULD TRAVEL FROM THE MOUTHS OF THE MISSISSIPPI
TO QUEBEC AND BE ON FRENCH TERRITORY AND UNDER FRENCH RULE ALL THE WAY
PRESENTLY I ASCENDED TO THE HURRICANE DECK AND CAST A LONGING GLANCE
TOWARD THE PILOT HOUSE
CHAPTER 24
MY INCOGNITO IS EXPLODED
AFTER A CLOSE STUDY OF THE FACE OF THE PILOT ON WATCH I WAS SATISFIED
THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE SO I WENT UP THERE
THE PILOT
INSPECTED ME I RE INSPECTED THE PILOT
THESE CUSTOMARY PRELIMINARIES
OVER I SAT DOWN ON THE HIGH BENCH AND HE FACED ABOUT AND WENT ON WITH
HIS WORK
EVERY DETAIL OF THE PILOT HOUSE WAS FAMILIAR TO ME WITH ONE
EXCEPTION A LARGE MOUTHED TUBE UNDER THE BREAST BOARD
I PUZZLED OVER
THAT THING A CONSIDERABLE TIME THEN GAVE UP AND ASKED WHAT IT WAS FOR
'TO HEAR THE ENGINE BELLS THROUGH
IT WAS ANOTHER GOOD CONTRIVANCE WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN INVENTED HALF A
CENTURY SOONER
SO I WAS THINKING WHEN THE PILOT ASKED
'DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ROPE IS FOR
I MANAGED TO GET AROUND THIS QUESTION WITHOUT COMMITTING MYSELF
'IS THIS THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE EVER IN A PILOT HOUSE
I CREPT UNDER THAT ONE
'WHERE ARE YOU FROM
'NEW ENGLAND
'FIRST TIME YOU HAVE EVER BEEN WEST
I CLIMBED OVER THIS ONE
'IF YOU TAKE AN INTEREST IN SUCH THINGS I CAN TELL YOU WHAT ALL THESE
THINGS ARE FOR
I SAID I SHOULD LIKE IT
'THIS PUTTING HIS HAND ON A BACKING BELL ROPE 'IS TO SOUND THE
FIRE ALARM THIS PUTTING HIS HAND ON A GO AHEAD BELL 'IS TO CALL THE
TEXAS TENDER THIS ONE INDICATING THE WHISTLE LEVER 'IS TO CALL THE
CAPTAIN' AND SO HE WENT ON TOUCHING ONE OBJECT AFTER ANOTHER AND
REELING OFF HIS TRANQUIL SPOOL OF LIES
I HAD NEVER FELT SO LIKE A PASSENGER BEFORE
I THANKED HIM WITH
EMOTION FOR EACH NEW FACT AND WROTE IT DOWN IN MY NOTE BOOK
THE
PILOT WARMED TO HIS OPPORTUNITY AND PROCEEDED TO LOAD ME UP IN THE GOOD
OLD FASHIONED WAY
AT TIMES I WAS AFRAID HE WAS GOING TO RUPTURE HIS
INVENTION BUT IT ALWAYS STOOD THE STRAIN AND HE PULLED THROUGH ALL
RIGHT
HE DRIFTED BY EASY STAGES INTO REVEALMENTS OF THE RIVER'S
MARVELOUS ECCENTRICITIES OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER AND BACKED THEM UP
WITH SOME PRETTY GIGANTIC ILLUSTRATIONS
FOR INSTANCE
'DO YOU SEE THAT LITTLE BOULDER STICKING OUT OF THE WATER YONDER WELL
WHEN I FIRST CAME ON THE RIVER THAT WAS A SOLID RIDGE OF ROCK OVER
SIXTY FEET HIGH AND TWO MILES LONG
ALL WASHED AWAY BUT THAT THIS
WITH A SIGH
I HAD A MIGHTY IMPULSE TO DESTROY HIM BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT KILLING
IN ANY ORDINARY WAY WOULD BE TOO GOOD FOR HIM
ONCE WHEN AN ODD LOOKING CRAFT WITH A VAST COAL SCUTTLE SLANTING ALOFT
ON THE END OF A BEAM WAS STEAMING BY IN THE DISTANCE HE INDIFFERENTLY
DREW ATTENTION TO IT AS ONE MIGHT TO AN OBJECT GROWN WEARISOME THROUGH
FAMILIARITY AND OBSERVED THAT IT WAS AN 'ALLIGATOR BOAT
'AN ALLIGATOR BOAT WHAT'S IT FOR
'TO DREDGE OUT ALLIGATORS WITH
'ARE THEY SO THICK AS TO BE TROUBLESOME
'WELL NOT NOW BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS THEM DOWN
BUT THEY USED
TO BE
NOT EVERYWHERE BUT IN FAVORITE PLACES HERE AND THERE WHERE
THE RIVER IS WIDE AND SHOAL LIKE PLUM POINT AND STACK ISLAND AND SO
ON PLACES THEY CALL ALLIGATOR BEDS
'DID THEY ACTUALLY IMPEDE NAVIGATION
'YEARS AGO YES IN VERY LOW WATER THERE WAS HARDLY A TRIP THEN THAT
WE DIDN'T GET AGROUND ON ALLIGATORS
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO GET OUT MY TOMAHAWK
HOWEVER I RESTRAINED MYSELF AND SAID
'IT MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFUL
'YES IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN DIFFICULTIES ABOUT PILOTING
IT WAS SO
HARD TO TELL ANYTHING ABOUT THE WATER THE DAMNED THINGS SHIFT AROUND
SO NEVER LIE STILL FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME
YOU CAN TELL A WIND REEF
STRAIGHT OFF BY THE LOOK OF IT YOU CAN TELL A BREAK YOU CAN TELL A
SAND REEF THAT'S ALL EASY BUT AN ALLIGATOR REEF DOESN'T SHOW UP WORTH
ANYTHING
NINE TIMES IN TEN YOU CAN'T TELL WHERE THE WATER IS AND WHEN
YOU DO SEE WHERE IT IS LIKE AS NOT IT AIN'T THERE WHEN YOU GET THERE
THE DEVILS HAVE SWAPPED AROUND SO MEANTIME
OF COURSE THERE WERE SOME
FEW PILOTS THAT COULD JUDGE OF ALLIGATOR WATER NEARLY AS WELL AS THEY
COULD OF ANY OTHER KIND BUT THEY HAD TO HAVE NATURAL TALENT FOR IT IT
WASN'T A THING A BODY COULD LEARN YOU HAD TO BE BORN WITH IT
LET
ME SEE THERE WAS BEN THORNBURG AND BECK JOLLY AND SQUIRE BELL AND
HORACE BIXBY AND MAJOR DOWNING AND JOHN STEVENSON AND BILLY GORDON
AND JIM BRADY AND GEORGE EALER AND BILLY YOUNGBLOOD ALL A 1 ALLIGATOR
PILOTS
THEY COULD TELL ALLIGATOR WATER AS FAR AS ANOTHER CHRISTIAN
COULD TELL WHISKEY
READ IT AH COULDN'T THEY THOUGH I ONLY WISH I
HAD AS MANY DOLLARS AS THEY COULD READ ALLIGATOR WATER A MILE AND A HALF
OFF
YES AND IT PAID THEM TO DO IT TOO
A GOOD ALLIGATOR PILOT COULD
ALWAYS GET FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH
NIGHTS OTHER PEOPLE HAD TO
LAY UP FOR ALLIGATORS BUT THOSE FELLOWS NEVER LAID UP FOR ALLIGATORS
THEY NEVER LAID UP FOR ANYTHING BUT FOG
THEY COULD SMELL THE BEST
ALLIGATOR WATER IT WAS SAID I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS SO OR NOT AND
I THINK A BODY'S GOT HIS HANDS FULL ENOUGH IF HE STICKS TO JUST WHAT HE
KNOWS HIMSELF WITHOUT GOING AROUND BACKING UP OTHER PEOPLE'S SAY SO'S
THOUGH THERE'S A PLENTY THAT AIN'T BACKWARD ABOUT DOING IT AS LONG AS
THEY CAN ROUST OUT SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
WHICH IS NOT THE STYLE
OF ROBERT STYLES BY AS MUCH AS THREE FATHOM MAYBE QUARTER LESS
MY WAS THIS ROB STYLES THIS MUSTACHED AND STATELY FIGURE A
SLIM ENOUGH CUB IN MY TIME
HOW HE HAS IMPROVED IN COMELINESS IN
FIVE AND TWENTY YEAR AND IN THE NOBLE ART OF INFLATING HIS FACTS AFTER
THESE MUSINGS I SAID ALOUD
'I SHOULD THINK THAT DREDGING OUT THE ALLIGATORS WOULDN'T HAVE DONE MUCH
GOOD BECAUSE THEY COULD COME BACK AGAIN RIGHT AWAY
'IF YOU HAD HAD AS MUCH EXPERIENCE OF ALLIGATORS AS I HAVE YOU WOULDN'T
TALK LIKE THAT
YOU DREDGE AN ALLIGATOR ONCE AND HE'S CONVINCED
IT'S
THE LAST YOU HEAR OF HIM
HE WOULDN'T COME BACK FOR PIE
IF THERE'S
ONE THING THAT AN ALLIGATOR IS MORE DOWN ON THAN ANOTHER IT'S BEING
DREDGED
BESIDES THEY WERE NOT SIMPLY SHOVED OUT OF THE WAY THE MOST
OF THE SCOOPFUL WERE SCOOPED ABOARD THEY EMPTIED THEM INTO THE
HOLD AND WHEN THEY HAD GOT A TRIP THEY TOOK THEM TO ORLEANS TO THE
GOVERNMENT WORKS
'WHAT FOR
'WHY TO MAKE SOLDIER SHOES OUT OF THEIR HIDES
ALL THE GOVERNMENT SHOES
ARE MADE OF ALLIGATOR HIDE
IT MAKES THE BEST SHOES IN THE WORLD
THEY
LAST FIVE YEARS AND THEY WON'T ABSORB WATER
THE ALLIGATOR FISHERY IS
A GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY
ALL THE ALLIGATORS ARE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY JUST
LIKE THE LIVE OAKS
YOU CUT DOWN A LIVE OAK AND GOVERNMENT FINES YOU
FIFTY DOLLARS YOU KILL AN ALLIGATOR AND UP YOU GO FOR MISPRISION
OF TREASON LUCKY DUCK IF THEY DON'T HANG YOU TOO
AND THEY WILL IF
YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT
THE BUZZARD IS THE SACRED BIRD OF THE SOUTH AND YOU
CAN'T TOUCH HIM THE ALLIGATOR IS THE SACRED BIRD OF THE GOVERNMENT AND
YOU'VE GOT TO LET HIM ALONE
'DO YOU EVER GET AGROUND ON THE ALLIGATORS NOW
'OH NO IT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR YEARS
'WELL THEN WHY DO THEY STILL KEEP THE ALLIGATOR BOATS IN SERVICE
'JUST FOR POLICE DUTY NOTHING MORE
THEY MERELY GO UP AND DOWN NOW
AND THEN
THE PRESENT GENERATION OF ALLIGATORS KNOW THEM AS EASY AS A
BURGLAR KNOWS A ROUNDSMAN WHEN THEY SEE ONE COMING THEY BREAK CAMP AND
GO FOR THE WOODS
AFTER ROUNDING OUT AND FINISHING UP AND POLISHING OFF THE ALLIGATOR
BUSINESS HE DROPPED EASILY AND COMFORTABLY INTO THE HISTORICAL VEIN
AND TOLD OF SOME TREMENDOUS FEATS OF HALF A DOZEN OLD TIME STEAMBOATS
OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE DWELLING AT SPECIAL LENGTH UPON A CERTAIN
EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE OF HIS CHIEF FAVORITE AMONG THIS DISTINGUISHED
FLEET AND THEN ADDING
'THAT BOAT WAS THE CYCLONE LAST TRIP SHE EVER MADE SHE SUNK THAT
VERY TRIP CAPTAIN WAS TOM BALLOU THE MOST IMMORTAL LIAR THAT EVER I
STRUCK
HE COULDN'T EVER SEEM TO TELL THE TRUTH IN ANY KIND OF WEATHER
WHY HE WOULD MAKE YOU FAIRLY SHUDDER
HE WAS THE MOST SCANDALOUS
LIAR I LEFT HIM FINALLY I COULDN'T STAND IT
THE PROVERB SAYS LIKE
MASTER LIKE MAN AND IF YOU STAY WITH THAT KIND OF A MAN YOU'LL COME
UNDER SUSPICION BY AND BY JUST AS SURE AS YOU LIVE
HE PAID FIRST CLASS
WAGES BUT SAID I WHAT'S WAGES WHEN YOUR REPUTATION'S IN DANGER SO I
LET THE WAGES GO AND FROZE TO MY REPUTATION
AND I'VE NEVER REGRETTED
IT
REPUTATION'S WORTH EVERYTHING AIN'T IT THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT
IT
HE HAD MORE SELFISH ORGANS THAN ANY SEVEN MEN IN THE WORLD ALL
PACKED IN THE STERN SHEETS OF HIS SKULL OF COURSE WHERE THEY BELONGED
THEY WEIGHED DOWN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD SO THAT IT MADE HIS NOSE TILT UP
IN THE AIR
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS VANITY BUT IT WASN'T IT WAS MALICE
IF YOU ONLY SAW HIS FOOT YOU'D TAKE HIM TO BE NINETEEN FEET HIGH BUT
HE WASN'T IT WAS BECAUSE HIS FOOT WAS OUT OF DRAWING
HE WAS INTENDED
TO BE NINETEEN FEET HIGH NO DOUBT IF HIS FOOT WAS MADE FIRST BUT HE
DIDN'T GET THERE HE WAS ONLY FIVE FEET TEN
THAT'S WHAT HE WAS AND
THAT'S WHAT HE IS
YOU TAKE THE LIES OUT OF HIM AND HE'LL SHRINK TO THE
SIZE OF YOUR HAT YOU TAKE THE MALICE OUT OF HIM AND HE'LL DISAPPEAR
THAT CYCLONE WAS A RATTLER TO GO AND THE SWEETEST THING TO STEER THAT
EVER WALKED THE WATERS
SET HER AMIDSHIPS IN A BIG RIVER AND JUST LET
HER GO IT WAS ALL YOU HAD TO DO
SHE WOULD HOLD HERSELF ON A STAR
ALL NIGHT IF YOU LET HER ALONE
YOU COULDN'T EVER FEEL HER RUDDER
IT
WASN'T ANY MORE LABOR TO STEER HER THAN IT IS TO COUNT THE REPUBLICAN
VOTE IN A SOUTH CAROLINA ELECTION
ONE MORNING JUST AT DAYBREAK THE
LAST TRIP SHE EVER MADE THEY TOOK HER RUDDER ABOARD TO MEND IT I
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT I BACKED HER OUT FROM THE WOOD YARD
AND WENT A WEAVING DOWN THE RIVER ALL SERENE
WHEN I HAD GONE ABOUT
TWENTY THREE MILES AND MADE FOUR HORRIBLY CROOKED CROSSINGS
'WITHOUT ANY RUDDER
'YES OLD CAPT
TOM APPEARED ON THE ROOF AND BEGAN TO FIND FAULT WITH ME
FOR RUNNING SUCH A DARK NIGHT
'SUCH A DARK NIGHT WHY YOU SAID
'NEVER MIND WHAT I SAID 'TWAS AS DARK AS EGYPT NOW THOUGH PRETTY SOON
THE MOON BEGAN TO RISE AND
'YOU MEAN THE SUN BECAUSE YOU STARTED OUT JUST AT BREAK OF LOOK
HERE WAS THIS BEFORE YOU QUITTED THE CAPTAIN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LYING
OR
'IT WAS BEFORE OH A LONG TIME BEFORE
AND AS I WAS SAYING HE
'BUT WAS THIS THE TRIP SHE SUNK OR WAS
'OH NO MONTHS AFTERWARD
AND SO THE OLD MAN HE
'THEN SHE MADE TWO LAST TRIPS BECAUSE YOU SAID
HE STEPPED BACK FROM THE WHEEL SWABBING AWAY HIS PERSPIRATION AND
SAID
'HERE CALLING ME BY NAME YOU TAKE HER AND LIE A WHILE YOU'RE
HANDIER AT IT THAN I AM
TRYING TO PLAY YOURSELF FOR A STRANGER AND AN
INNOCENT WHY I KNEW YOU BEFORE YOU HAD SPOKEN SEVEN WORDS AND I MADE
UP MY MIND TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS YOUR LITTLE GAME
IT WAS TO DRAW ME
OUT
WELL I LET YOU DIDN'T I NOW TAKE THE WHEEL AND FINISH THE
WATCH AND NEXT TIME PLAY FAIR AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO WORK YOUR
PASSAGE
THUS ENDED THE FICTITIOUS NAME BUSINESS
AND NOT SIX HOURS OUT FROM ST
LOUIS BUT I HAD GAINED A PRIVILEGE ANY WAY FOR I HAD BEEN ITCHING
TO GET MY HANDS ON THE WHEEL FROM THE BEGINNING
I SEEMED TO HAVE
FORGOTTEN THE RIVER BUT I HADN'T FORGOTTEN HOW TO STEER A STEAMBOAT
NOR HOW TO ENJOY IT EITHER
CHAPTER 25
FROM CAIRO TO HICKMAN
THE SCENERY FROM ST
LOUIS TO CAIRO TWO HUNDRED MILES IS VARIED AND
BEAUTIFUL
THE HILLS WERE CLOTHED IN THE FRESH FOLIAGE OF SPRING NOW
AND WERE A GRACIOUS AND WORTHY SETTING FOR THE BROAD RIVER FLOWING
BETWEEN
OUR TRIP BEGAN AUSPICIOUSLY WITH A PERFECT DAY AS TO
BREEZE AND SUNSHINE AND OUR BOAT THREW THE MILES OUT BEHIND HER WITH
SATISFACTORY DESPATCH
WE FOUND A RAILWAY INTRUDING AT CHESTER ILLINOIS CHESTER HAS ALSO A
PENITENTIARY NOW AND IS OTHERWISE MARCHING ON
AT GRAND TOWER TOO
THERE WAS A RAILWAY AND ANOTHER AT CAPE GIRARDEAU
THE FORMER TOWN GETS
ITS NAME FROM A HUGE SQUAT PILLAR OF ROCK WHICH STANDS UP OUT OF THE
WATER ON THE MISSOURI SIDE OF THE RIVER A PIECE OF NATURE'S FANCIFUL
HANDIWORK AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PICTURESQUE FEATURES OF THE SCENERY OF
THAT REGION
FOR NEARER OR REMOTER NEIGHBORS THE TOWER HAS THE DEVIL'S
BAKE OVEN SO CALLED PERHAPS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POWERFULLY RESEMBLE
ANYBODY ELSE'S BAKE OVEN AND THE DEVIL'S TEA TABLE THIS LATTER A GREAT
SMOOTH SURFACED MASS OF ROCK WITH DIMINISHING WINE GLASS STEM PERCHED
SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE RIVER BESIDE A BEFLOWERED AND
GARLANDED PRECIPICE AND SUFFICIENTLY LIKE A TEA TABLE TO ANSWER FOR
ANYBODY DEVIL OR CHRISTIAN
AWAY DOWN THE RIVER WE HAVE THE DEVIL'S
ELBOW AND THE DEVIL'S RACE COURSE AND LOTS OF OTHER PROPERTY OF HIS
WHICH I CANNOT NOW CALL TO MIND
THE TOWN OF GRAND TOWER WAS EVIDENTLY A BUSIER PLACE THAN IT HAD BEEN IN
OLD TIMES BUT IT SEEMED TO NEED SOME REPAIRS HERE AND THERE AND A NEW
COAT OF WHITEWASH ALL OVER
STILL IT WAS PLEASANT TO ME TO SEE THE OLD
COAT ONCE MORE
'UNCLE' MUMFORD OUR SECOND OFFICER SAID THE PLACE HAD
BEEN SUFFERING FROM HIGH WATER AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NOT LOOKING ITS
BEST NOW
BUT HE SAID IT WAS NOT STRANGE THAT IT DIDN'T WASTE WHITE WASH
ON ITSELF FOR MORE LIME WAS MADE THERE AND OF A BETTER QUALITY THAN
ANYWHERE IN THE WEST AND ADDED 'ON A DAIRY FARM YOU NEVER CAN GET ANY
MILK FOR YOUR COFFEE NOR ANY SUGAR FOR IT ON A SUGAR PLANTATION AND IT
IS AGAINST SENSE TO GO TO A LIME TOWN TO HUNT FOR WHITE WASH IN MY OWN
EXPERIENCE I KNEW THE FIRST TWO ITEMS TO BE TRUE AND ALSO THAT PEOPLE
WHO SELL CANDY DON'T CARE FOR CANDY THEREFORE THERE WAS PLAUSIBILITY IN
UNCLE MUMFORD'S FINAL OBSERVATION THAT 'PEOPLE WHO MAKE LIME RUN MORE TO
RELIGION THAN WHITEWASH UNCLE MUMFORD SAID FURTHER THAT GRAND TOWER
WAS A GREAT COALING CENTER AND A PROSPERING PLACE
CAPE GIRARDEAU IS SITUATED ON A HILLSIDE AND MAKES A HANDSOME
APPEARANCE
THERE IS A GREAT JESUIT SCHOOL FOR BOYS AT THE FOOT OF THE
TOWN BY THE RIVER
UNCLE MUMFORD SAID IT HAD AS HIGH A REPUTATION FOR
THOROUGHNESS AS ANY SIMILAR INSTITUTION IN MISSOURI THERE WAS ANOTHER
COLLEGE HIGHER UP ON AN AIRY SUMMIT A BRIGHT NEW EDIFICE PICTURESQUELY
AND PECULIARLY TOWERED AND PINNACLED A SORT OF GIGANTIC CASTERS WITH
THE CRUETS ALL COMPLETE
UNCLE MUMFORD SAID THAT CAPE GIRARDEAU WAS THE
ATHENS OF MISSOURI AND CONTAINED SEVERAL COLLEGES BESIDES THOSE ALREADY
MENTIONED AND ALL OF THEM ON A RELIGIOUS BASIS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER
HE DIRECTED MY ATTENTION TO WHAT HE CALLED THE 'STRONG AND PERVASIVE
RELIGIOUS LOOK OF THE TOWN BUT I COULD NOT SEE THAT IT LOOKED MORE
RELIGIOUS THAN THE OTHER HILL TOWNS WITH THE SAME SLOPE AND BUILT OF THE
SAME KIND OF BRICKS
PARTIALITIES OFTEN MAKE PEOPLE SEE MORE THAN REALLY
EXISTS
UNCLE MUMFORD HAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS A MATE ON THE RIVER
HE IS A MAN OF
PRACTICAL SENSE AND A LEVEL HEAD HAS OBSERVED HAS HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE
OF ONE SORT AND ANOTHER HAS OPINIONS HAS ALSO JUST A PERCEPTIBLE
DASH OF POETRY IN HIS COMPOSITION AN EASY GIFT OF SPEECH A THICK
GROWL IN HIS VOICE AND AN OATH OR TWO WHERE HE CAN GET AT THEM WHEN THE
EXIGENCIES OF HIS OFFICE REQUIRE A SPIRITUAL LIFT
HE IS A MATE OF THE
BLESSED OLD TIME KIND AND GOES GRAVELY DAMNING AROUND WHEN THERE IS
WORK TO THE FORE IN A WAY TO MELLOW THE EX STEAMBOATMAN'S HEART WITH
SWEET SOFT LONGINGS FOR THE VANISHED DAYS THAT SHALL COME NO MORE
GIT UP THERE YOU GOING TO BE ALL DAY WHY D'N'T YOU SAY YOU WAS
PETRIFIED IN YOUR HIND LEGS BEFORE YOU SHIPPED
HE IS A STEADY MAN WITH HIS CREW KIND AND JUST BUT FIRM SO THEY
LIKE HIM AND STAY WITH HIM
HE IS STILL IN THE SLOUCHY GARB OF THE
OLD GENERATION OF MATES BUT NEXT TRIP THE ANCHOR LINE WILL HAVE HIM IN
UNIFORM A NATTY BLUE NAVAL UNIFORM WITH BRASS BUTTONS ALONG WITH ALL
THE OFFICERS OF THE LINE AND THEN HE WILL BE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STYLE
OF SCENERY FROM WHAT HE IS NOW
UNIFORMS ON THE MISSISSIPPI IT BEATS ALL THE OTHER CHANGES PUT
TOGETHER FOR SURPRISE
STILL THERE IS ANOTHER SURPRISE THAT IT WAS
NOT MADE FIFTY YEARS AGO
IT IS SO MANIFESTLY SENSIBLE THAT IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF EARLIER ONE WOULD SUPPOSE
DURING FIFTY YEARS OUT
THERE THE INNOCENT PASSENGER IN NEED OF HELP AND INFORMATION HAS BEEN
MISTAKING THE MATE FOR THE COOK AND THE CAPTAIN FOR THE BARBER AND
BEING ROUGHLY ENTERTAINED FOR IT TOO
BUT HIS TROUBLES ARE ENDED NOW
AND THE GREATLY IMPROVED ASPECT OF THE BOAT'S STAFF IS ANOTHER ADVANTAGE
ACHIEVED BY THE DRESS REFORM PERIOD
STEERED DOWN THE BEND BELOW CAPE GIRARDEAU
THEY USED TO CALL IT
'STEERSMAN'S BEND PLAIN SAILING AND PLENTY OF WATER IN IT ALWAYS
ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE IN THE UPPER RIVER THAT A NEW CUB WAS ALLOWED TO
TAKE A BOAT THROUGH IN LOW WATER
THEBES AT THE HEAD OF THE GRAND CHAIN AND COMMERCE AT THE FOOT OF IT
WERE TOWNS EASILY REMEMBERABLE AS THEY HAD NOT UNDERGONE CONSPICUOUS
ALTERATION
NOR THE CHAIN EITHER IN THE NATURE OF THINGS FOR IT IS A
CHAIN OF SUNKEN ROCKS ADMIRABLY ARRANGED TO CAPTURE AND KILL STEAMBOATS
ON BAD NIGHTS
A GOOD MANY STEAMBOAT CORPSES LIE BURIED THERE OUT OF
SIGHT AMONG THE REST MY FIRST FRIEND THE 'PAUL JONES SHE KNOCKED HER
BOTTOM OUT AND WENT DOWN LIKE A POT SO THE HISTORIAN TOLD ME UNCLE
MUMFORD
HE SAID SHE HAD A GRAY MARE ABOARD AND A PREACHER
TO ME
THIS SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTED FOR THE DISASTER AS IT DID OF COURSE TO
MUMFORD WHO ADDED
'BUT THERE ARE MANY IGNORANT PEOPLE WHO WOULD SCOFF AT SUCH A MATTER
AND CALL IT SUPERSTITION
BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS NOTICE THAT THEY ARE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TRAVELED WITH A GRAY MARE AND A PREACHER
I WENT
DOWN THE RIVER ONCE IN SUCH COMPANY
WE GROUNDED AT BLOODY ISLAND WE
GROUNDED AT HANGING DOG WE GROUNDED JUST BELOW THIS SAME COMMERCE
WE JOLTED BEAVER DAM ROCK WE HIT ONE OF THE WORST BREAKS IN THE
'GRAVEYARD' BEHIND GOOSE ISLAND WE HAD A ROUSTABOUT KILLED IN A FIGHT
WE BURNT A BOILER BROKE A SHAFT COLLAPSED A FLUE AND WENT INTO CAIRO
WITH NINE FEET OF WATER IN THE HOLD MAY HAVE BEEN MORE MAY HAVE BEEN
LESS
I REMEMBER IT AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY
THE MEN LOST THEIR HEADS
WITH TERROR
THEY PAINTED THE MARE BLUE IN SIGHT OF TOWN AND THREW THE
PREACHER OVERBOARD OR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ARRIVED AT ALL
THE PREACHER
WAS FISHED OUT AND SAVED
HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD BEEN TO
BLAME
I REMEMBER IT ALL AS IF IT WERE YESTERDAY
THAT THIS COMBINATION OF PREACHER AND GRAY MARE SHOULD BREED CALAMITY
SEEMS STRANGE AND AT FIRST GLANCE UNBELIEVABLE BUT THE FACT IS
FORTIFIED BY SO MUCH UNASSAILABLE PROOF THAT TO DOUBT IS TO DISHONOR
REASON
I MYSELF REMEMBER A CASE WHERE A CAPTAIN WAS WARNED BY NUMEROUS
FRIENDS AGAINST TAKING A GRAY MARE AND A PREACHER WITH HIM BUT
PERSISTED IN HIS PURPOSE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT COULD BE SAID AND THE
SAME DAY IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE NEXT AND SOME SAY IT WAS THOUGH I THINK
IT WAS THE SAME DAY HE GOT DRUNK AND FELL DOWN THE HATCHWAY AND WAS
BORNE TO HIS HOME A CORPSE
THIS IS LITERALLY TRUE
NO VESTIGE OF HAT ISLAND IS LEFT NOW EVERY SHRED OF IT IS WASHED AWAY
I DO NOT EVEN REMEMBER WHAT PART OF THE RIVER IT USED TO BE IN
EXCEPT THAT IT WAS BETWEEN ST
LOUIS AND CAIRO SOMEWHERE
IT WAS A BAD
REGION ALL AROUND AND ABOUT HAT ISLAND IN EARLY DAYS
A FARMER WHO
LIVED ON THE ILLINOIS SHORE THERE SAID THAT TWENTY NINE STEAMBOATS HAD
LEFT THEIR BONES STRUNG ALONG WITHIN SIGHT FROM HIS HOUSE
BETWEEN
ST
LOUIS AND CAIRO THE STEAMBOAT WRECKS AVERAGE ONE TO THE MILE TWO
HUNDRED WRECKS ALTOGETHER
I COULD RECOGNIZE BIG CHANGES FROM COMMERCE DOWN
BEAVER DAM ROCK WAS
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER NOW AND THROWING A PRODIGIOUS 'BREAK
IT USED TO BE CLOSE TO THE SHORE AND BOATS WENT DOWN OUTSIDE OF IT
A BIG ISLAND THAT USED TO BE AWAY OUT IN MID RIVER HAS RETIRED TO THE
MISSOURI SHORE AND BOATS DO NOT GO NEAR IT ANY MORE
THE ISLAND CALLED
JACKET PATTERN IS WHITTLED DOWN TO A WEDGE NOW AND IS BOOKED FOR EARLY
DESTRUCTION
GOOSE ISLAND IS ALL GONE BUT A LITTLE DAB THE SIZE OF A
STEAMBOAT
THE PERILOUS 'GRAVEYARD AMONG WHOSE NUMBERLESS WRECKS
WE USED TO PICK OUR WAY SO SLOWLY AND GINGERLY IS FAR AWAY FROM THE
CHANNEL NOW AND A TERROR TO NOBODY
ONE OF THE ISLANDS FORMERLY CALLED
THE TWO SISTERS IS GONE ENTIRELY THE OTHER WHICH USED TO LIE CLOSE
TO THE ILLINOIS SHORE IS NOW ON THE MISSOURI SIDE A MILE AWAY IT IS
JOINED SOLIDLY TO THE SHORE AND IT TAKES A SHARP EYE TO SEE WHERE THE
SEAM IS BUT IT IS ILLINOIS GROUND YET AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON
IT HAVE TO FERRY THEMSELVES OVER AND WORK THE ILLINOIS ROADS AND PAY
ILLINOIS TAXES SINGULAR STATE OF THINGS
NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER SEVERAL ISLANDS WERE MISSING WASHED AWAY
CAIRO WAS STILL THERE EASILY VISIBLE ACROSS THE LONG FLAT POINT UPON
WHOSE FURTHER VERGE IT STANDS BUT WE HAD TO STEAM A LONG WAY AROUND
TO GET TO IT
NIGHT FELL AS WE WERE GOING OUT OF THE 'UPPER RIVER' AND
MEETING THE FLOODS OF THE OHIO
WE DASHED ALONG WITHOUT ANXIETY FOR
THE HIDDEN ROCK WHICH USED TO LIE RIGHT IN THE WAY HAS MOVED UP STREAM
A LONG DISTANCE OUT OF THE CHANNEL OR RATHER ABOUT ONE COUNTY HAS GONE
INTO THE RIVER FROM THE MISSOURI POINT AND THE CAIRO POINT HAS 'MADE
DOWN' AND ADDED TO ITS LONG TONGUE OF TERRITORY CORRESPONDINGLY
THE
MISSISSIPPI IS A JUST AND EQUITABLE RIVER IT NEVER TUMBLES ONE MAN'S
FARM OVERBOARD WITHOUT BUILDING A NEW FARM JUST LIKE IT FOR THAT MAN'S
NEIGHBOR
THIS KEEPS DOWN HARD FEELINGS
GOING INTO CAIRO WE CAME NEAR KILLING A STEAMBOAT WHICH PAID NO
ATTENTION TO OUR WHISTLE AND THEN TRIED TO CROSS OUR BOWS
BY DOING SOME
STRONG BACKING WE SAVED HIM WHICH WAS A GREAT LOSS FOR HE WOULD HAVE
MADE GOOD LITERATURE
CAIRO IS A BRISK TOWN NOW AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY BUILT AND HAS A CITY
LOOK ABOUT IT WHICH IS IN NOTICEABLE CONTRAST TO ITS FORMER ESTATE AS
PER MR
DICKENS'S PORTRAIT OF IT
HOWEVER IT WAS ALREADY BUILDING WITH
BRICKS WHEN I HAD SEEN IT LAST WHICH WAS WHEN COLONEL NOW GENERAL
GRANT WAS DRILLING HIS FIRST COMMAND THERE
UNCLE MUMFORD SAYS THE
LIBRARIES AND SUNDAY SCHOOLS HAVE DONE A GOOD WORK IN CAIRO AS WELL AS
THE BRICK MASONS
CAIRO HAS A HEAVY RAILROAD AND RIVER TRADE AND HER
SITUATION AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO GREAT RIVERS IS SO ADVANTAGEOUS
THAT SHE CANNOT WELL HELP PROSPERING
WHEN I TURNED OUT IN THE MORNING WE HAD PASSED COLUMBUS KENTUCKY
AND WERE APPROACHING HICKMAN A PRETTY TOWN PERCHED ON A HANDSOME HILL
HICKMAN IS IN A RICH TOBACCO REGION AND FORMERLY ENJOYED A GREAT AND
LUCRATIVE TRADE IN THAT STAPLE COLLECTING IT THERE IN HER WAREHOUSES
FROM A LARGE AREA OF COUNTRY AND SHIPPING IT BY BOAT BUT UNCLE MUMFORD
SAYS SHE BUILT A RAILWAY TO FACILITATE THIS COMMERCE A LITTLE MORE AND
HE THINKS IT FACILITATED IT THE WRONG WAY TOOK THE BULK OF THE TRADE
OUT OF HER HANDS BY 'COLLARING IT ALONG THE LINE WITHOUT GATHERING IT AT
HER DOORS
CHAPTER 26
UNDER FIRE
TALK BEGAN TO RUN UPON THE WAR NOW FOR WE WERE GETTING DOWN INTO THE
UPPER EDGE OF THE FORMER BATTLE STRETCH BY THIS TIME
COLUMBUS WAS JUST
BEHIND US SO THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL SAID ABOUT THE FAMOUS BATTLE OF
BELMONT
SEVERAL OF THE BOAT'S OFFICERS HAD SEEN ACTIVE SERVICE IN THE
MISSISSIPPI WAR FLEET
I GATHERED THAT THEY FOUND THEMSELVES SADLY OUT
OF THEIR ELEMENT IN THAT KIND OF BUSINESS AT FIRST BUT AFTERWARD GOT
ACCUSTOMED TO IT RECONCILED TO IT AND MORE OR LESS AT HOME IN IT
ONE
OF OUR PILOTS HAD HIS FIRST WAR EXPERIENCE IN THE BELMONT FIGHT AS A
PILOT ON A BOAT IN THE CONFEDERATE SERVICE
I HAD OFTEN HAD A CURIOSITY
TO KNOW HOW A GREEN HAND MIGHT FEEL IN HIS MAIDEN BATTLE PERCHED ALL
SOLITARY AND ALONE ON HIGH IN A PILOT HOUSE A TARGET FOR TOM DICK
AND HARRY AND NOBODY AT HIS ELBOW TO SHAME HIM FROM SHOWING THE WHITE
FEATHER WHEN MATTERS GREW HOT AND PERILOUS AROUND HIM SO TO ME HIS
STORY WAS VALUABLE IT FILLED A GAP FOR ME WHICH ALL HISTORIES HAD LEFT
TILL THAT TIME EMPTY
THE PILOT'S FIRST BATTLE
HE SAID
IT WAS THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER
THE FIGHT BEGAN AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING
I
WAS ON THE 'R
H
W
HILL TOOK OVER A LOAD OF TROOPS FROM COLUMBUS
CAME BACK AND TOOK OVER A BATTERY OF ARTILLERY
MY PARTNER SAID HE
WAS GOING TO SEE THE FIGHT WANTED ME TO GO ALONG
I SAID NO I WASN'T
ANXIOUS I WOULD LOOK AT IT FROM THE PILOT HOUSE
HE SAID I WAS A
COWARD AND LEFT
THAT FIGHT WAS AN AWFUL SIGHT
GENERAL CHEATHAM MADE HIS MEN STRIP THEIR
COATS OFF AND THROW THEM IN A PILE AND SAID 'NOW FOLLOW ME TO HELL
OR VICTORY I HEARD HIM SAY THAT FROM THE PILOT HOUSE AND THEN HE
GALLOPED IN AT THE HEAD OF HIS TROOPS
OLD GENERAL PILLOW WITH HIS
WHITE HAIR MOUNTED ON A WHITE HORSE SAILED IN TOO LEADING HIS TROOPS
AS LIVELY AS A BOY
BY AND BY THE FEDERALS CHASED THE REBELS BACK AND
HERE THEY CAME TEARING ALONG EVERYBODY FOR HIMSELF AND DEVIL TAKE THE
HINDMOST AND DOWN UNDER THE BANK THEY SCRAMBLED AND TOOK SHELTER
I
WAS SITTING WITH MY LEGS HANGING OUT OF THE PILOT HOUSE WINDOW
ALL AT
ONCE I NOTICED A WHIZZING SOUND PASSING MY EAR
JUDGED IT WAS A BULLET
I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING I JUST TILTED OVER BACKWARDS AND
LANDED ON THE FLOOR AND STAID THERE
THE BALLS CAME BOOMING AROUND
THREE CANNON BALLS WENT THROUGH THE CHIMNEY ONE BALL TOOK OFF THE
CORNER OF THE PILOT HOUSE SHELLS WERE SCREAMING AND BURSTING ALL
AROUND
MIGHTY WARM TIMES I WISHED I HADN'T COME
I LAY THERE ON THE PILOT HOUSE FLOOR WHILE THE SHOTS CAME FASTER
AND FASTER
I CREPT IN BEHIND THE BIG STOVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
PILOT HOUSE
PRESENTLY A MINIE BALL CAME THROUGH THE STOVE AND JUST
GRAZED MY HEAD AND CUT MY HAT
I JUDGED IT WAS TIME TO GO AWAY
FROM THERE
THE CAPTAIN WAS ON THE ROOF WITH A RED HEADED MAJOR FROM
MEMPHIS A FINE LOOKING MAN
I HEARD HIM SAY HE WANTED TO LEAVE HERE
BUT 'THAT PILOT IS KILLED I CREPT OVER TO THE STARBOARD SIDE TO PULL
THE BELL TO SET HER BACK RAISED UP AND TOOK A LOOK AND I SAW ABOUT
FIFTEEN SHOT HOLES THROUGH THE WINDOW PANES HAD COME SO LIVELY I HADN'T
NOTICED THEM
I GLANCED OUT ON THE WATER AND THE SPATTERING SHOT WERE
LIKE A HAILSTORM
I THOUGHT BEST TO GET OUT OF THAT PLACE
I WENT DOWN
THE PILOT HOUSE GUY HEAD FIRST NOT FEET FIRST BUT HEAD FIRST SLID
DOWN BEFORE I STRUCK THE DECK THE CAPTAIN SAID WE MUST LEAVE THERE
SO
I CLIMBED UP THE GUY AND GOT ON THE FLOOR AGAIN
ABOUT THAT TIME THEY
COLLARED MY PARTNER AND WERE BRINGING HIM UP TO THE PILOT HOUSE BETWEEN
TWO SOLDIERS
SOMEBODY HAD SAID I WAS KILLED
HE PUT HIS HEAD IN AND SAW
ME ON THE FLOOR REACHING FOR THE BACKING BELLS
HE SAID 'OH HELL HE
AIN'T SHOT AND JERKED AWAY FROM THE MEN WHO HAD HIM BY THE COLLAR AND
RAN BELOW
WE WERE THERE UNTIL THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND THEN
GOT AWAY ALL RIGHT
THE NEXT TIME I SAW MY PARTNER I SAID 'NOW COME OUT BE HONEST AND
TELL ME THE TRUTH
WHERE DID YOU GO WHEN YOU WENT TO SEE THAT BATTLE
HE SAYS 'I WENT DOWN IN THE HOLD
ALL THROUGH THAT FIGHT I WAS SCARED NEARLY TO DEATH
I HARDLY KNEW
ANYTHING I WAS SO FRIGHTENED BUT YOU SEE NOBODY KNEW THAT BUT ME
NEXT DAY GENERAL POLK SENT FOR ME AND PRAISED ME FOR MY BRAVERY AND
GALLANT CONDUCT
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING I LET IT GO AT THAT
I JUDGED IT
WASN'T SO BUT IT WAS NOT FOR ME TO CONTRADICT A GENERAL OFFICER
PRETTY SOON AFTER THAT I WAS SICK AND USED UP AND HAD TO GO OFF TO
THE HOT SPRINGS
WHEN THERE I GOT A GOOD MANY LETTERS FROM COMMANDERS
SAYING THEY WANTED ME TO COME BACK
I DECLINED BECAUSE I WASN'T WELL
ENOUGH OR STRONG ENOUGH BUT I KEPT STILL AND KEPT THE REPUTATION I HAD
MADE
A PLAIN STORY STRAIGHTFORWARDLY TOLD BUT MUMFORD TOLD ME THAT THAT
PILOT HAD 'GILDED THAT SCARE OF HIS IN SPOTS THAT HIS SUBSEQUENT
CAREER IN THE WAR WAS PROOF OF IT
WE STRUCK DOWN THROUGH THE CHUTE OF ISLAND NO
8 AND I WENT BELOW
AND FELL INTO CONVERSATION WITH A PASSENGER A HANDSOME MAN WITH EASY
CARRIAGE AND AN INTELLIGENT FACE
WE WERE APPROACHING ISLAND NO
10
A PLACE SO CELEBRATED DURING THE WAR
THIS GENTLEMAN'S HOME WAS ON THE
MAIN SHORE IN ITS NEIGHBORHOOD
I HAD SOME TALK WITH HIM ABOUT THE WAR
TIMES BUT PRESENTLY THE DISCOURSE FELL UPON 'FEUDS FOR IN NO PART OF
THE SOUTH HAS THE VENDETTA FLOURISHED MORE BRISKLY OR HELD OUT LONGER
BETWEEN WARRING FAMILIES THAN IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION
THIS GENTLEMAN
SAID
'THERE'S BEEN MORE THAN ONE FEUD AROUND HERE IN OLD TIMES BUT I RECKON
THE WORST ONE WAS BETWEEN THE DARNELLS AND THE WATSONS
NOBODY DON'T
KNOW NOW WHAT THE FIRST QUARREL WAS ABOUT IT'S SO LONG AGO THE
DARNELLS AND THE WATSONS DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OF THEM LIVING
WHICH I DON'T THINK THERE IS
SOME SAYS IT WAS ABOUT A HORSE OR A
COW ANYWAY IT WAS A LITTLE MATTER THE MONEY IN IT WASN'T OF NO
CONSEQUENCE NONE IN THE WORLD BOTH FAMILIES WAS RICH
THE THING COULD
HAVE BEEN FIXED UP EASY ENOUGH BUT NO THAT WOULDN'T DO
ROUGH WORDS
HAD BEEN PASSED AND SO NOTHING BUT BLOOD COULD FIX IT UP AFTER THAT
THAT HORSE OR COW WHICHEVER IT WAS COST SIXTY YEARS OF KILLING AND
CRIPPLING EVERY YEAR OR SO SOMEBODY WAS SHOT ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
AND AS FAST AS ONE GENERATION WAS LAID OUT THEIR SONS TOOK UP THE FEUD
AND KEPT IT A GOING
AND IT'S JUST AS I SAY THEY WENT ON SHOOTING EACH
OTHER YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT MAKING A KIND OF A RELIGION OF IT YOU
SEE TILL THEY'D DONE FORGOT LONG AGO WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
WHEREVER
A DARNELL CAUGHT A WATSON OR A WATSON CAUGHT A DARNELL ONE OF 'EM WAS
GOING TO GET HURT ONLY QUESTION WAS WHICH OF THEM GOT THE DROP ON
THE OTHER
THEY'D SHOOT ONE ANOTHER DOWN RIGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF THE
FAMILY
THEY DIDN'T HUNT FOR EACH OTHER BUT WHEN THEY HAPPENED TO MEET
THEY PUFFED AND BEGUN
MEN WOULD SHOOT BOYS BOYS WOULD SHOOT MEN
A MAN
SHOT A BOY TWELVE YEARS OLD HAPPENED ON HIM IN THE WOODS AND DIDN'T
GIVE HIM NO CHANCE
IF HE HAD 'A' GIVEN HIM A CHANCE THE BOY'D 'A'
SHOT HIM
BOTH FAMILIES BELONGED TO THE SAME CHURCH EVERYBODY AROUND
HERE IS RELIGIOUS THROUGH ALL THIS FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS' FUSS BOTH
TRIBES WAS THERE EVERY SUNDAY TO WORSHIP
THEY LIVED EACH SIDE OF THE
LINE AND THE CHURCH WAS AT A LANDING CALLED COMPROMISE
HALF THE CHURCH
AND HALF THE AISLE WAS IN KENTUCKY THE OTHER HALF IN TENNESSEE
SUNDAYS
YOU'D SEE THE FAMILIES DRIVE UP ALL IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES MEN
WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND FILE UP THE AISLE AND SET DOWN QUIET AND
ORDERLY ONE LOT ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF THE CHURCH AND THE OTHER ON
THE KENTUCKY SIDE AND THE MEN AND BOYS WOULD LEAN THEIR GUNS UP AGAINST
THE WALL HANDY AND THEN ALL HANDS WOULD JOIN IN WITH THE PRAYER AND
PRAISE THOUGH THEY SAY THE MAN NEXT THE AISLE DIDN'T KNEEL DOWN ALONG
WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY KIND OF STOOD GUARD
I DON'T KNOW NEVER
WAS AT THAT CHURCH IN MY LIFE BUT I REMEMBER THAT THAT'S WHAT USED TO
BE SAID
'TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO ONE OF THE FEUD FAMILIES CAUGHT A
YOUNG MAN OF NINETEEN OUT AND KILLED HIM
DON'T REMEMBER WHETHER IT WAS
THE DARNELLS AND WATSONS OR ONE OF THE OTHER FEUDS BUT ANYWAY THIS
YOUNG MAN RODE UP STEAMBOAT LAYING THERE AT THE TIME AND THE FIRST
THING HE SAW WAS A WHOLE GANG OF THE ENEMY
HE JUMPED DOWN BEHIND A
WOOD PILE BUT THEY RODE AROUND AND BEGUN ON HIM HE FIRING BACK AND
THEY GALLOPING AND CAVORTING AND YELLING AND BANGING AWAY WITH ALL THEIR
MIGHT
THINK HE WOUNDED A COUPLE OF THEM BUT THEY CLOSED IN ON HIM
AND CHASED HIM INTO THE RIVER AND AS HE SWUM ALONG DOWN STREAM THEY
FOLLOWED ALONG THE BANK AND KEPT ON SHOOTING AT HIM AND WHEN HE STRUCK
SHORE HE WAS DEAD
WINDY MARSHALL TOLD ME ABOUT IT
HE SAW IT
HE WAS
CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT
'YEARS AGO THE DARNELLS WAS SO THINNED OUT THAT THE OLD MAN AND HIS TWO
SONS CONCLUDED THEY'D LEAVE THE COUNTRY
THEY STARTED TO TAKE STEAMBOAT
JUST ABOVE NO
10 BUT THE WATSONS GOT WIND OF IT AND THEY ARRIVED JUST
AS THE TWO YOUNG DARNELLS WAS WALKING UP THE COMPANION WAY WITH THEIR
WIVES ON THEIR ARMS
THE FIGHT BEGUN THEN AND THEY NEVER GOT NO
FURTHER BOTH OF THEM KILLED
AFTER THAT OLD DARNELL GOT INTO TROUBLE
WITH THE MAN THAT RUN THE FERRY AND THE FERRY MAN GOT THE WORST
OF IT AND DIED
BUT HIS FRIENDS SHOT OLD DARNELL THROUGH AND
THROUGH FILLED HIM FULL OF BULLETS AND ENDED HIM
THE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN WHO TOLD ME THESE THINGS HAD BEEN REARED IN EASE
AND COMFORT WAS A MAN OF GOOD PARTS AND WAS COLLEGE BRED
HIS LOOSE
GRAMMAR WAS THE FRUIT OF CARELESS HABIT NOT IGNORANCE
THIS HABIT
AMONG EDUCATED MEN IN THE WEST IS NOT UNIVERSAL BUT IT IS
PREVALENT PREVALENT IN THE TOWNS CERTAINLY IF NOT IN THE CITIES AND
TO A DEGREE WHICH ONE CANNOT HELP NOTICING AND MARVELING AT
I HEARD A
WESTERNER WHO WOULD BE ACCOUNTED A HIGHLY EDUCATED MAN IN ANY COUNTRY
SAY 'NEVER MIND IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE ANYWAY A LIFE LONG
RESIDENT WHO WAS PRESENT HEARD IT BUT IT MADE NO IMPRESSION UPON HER
SHE WAS ABLE TO RECALL THE FACT AFTERWARD WHEN REMINDED OF IT BUT
SHE CONFESSED THAT THE WORDS HAD NOT GRATED UPON HER EAR AT THE
TIME A CONFESSION WHICH SUGGESTS THAT IF EDUCATED PEOPLE CAN HEAR SUCH
BLASPHEMOUS GRAMMAR FROM SUCH A SOURCE AND BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DEED
THE CRIME MUST BE TOLERABLY COMMON SO COMMON THAT THE GENERAL EAR HAS
BECOME DULLED BY FAMILIARITY WITH IT AND IS NO LONGER ALERT NO LONGER
SENSITIVE TO SUCH AFFRONTS
NO ONE IN THE WORLD SPEAKS BLEMISHLESS GRAMMAR NO ONE HAS EVER WRITTEN
IT NO ONE EITHER IN THE WORLD OR OUT OF IT TAKING THE SCRIPTURES
FOR EVIDENCE ON THE LATTER POINT THEREFORE IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO
EXACT GRAMMATICAL PERFECTION FROM THE PEOPLES OF THE VALLEY BUT THEY
AND ALL OTHER PEOPLES MAY JUSTLY BE REQUIRED TO REFRAIN FROM KNOWINGLY
AND PURPOSELY DEBAUCHING THEIR GRAMMAR
I FOUND THE RIVER GREATLY CHANGED AT ISLAND NO
10
THE ISLAND WHICH
I REMEMBERED WAS SOME THREE MILES LONG AND A QUARTER OF A MILE WIDE
HEAVILY TIMBERED AND LAY NEAR THE KENTUCKY SHORE WITHIN TWO HUNDRED
YARDS OF IT I SHOULD SAY
NOW HOWEVER ONE HAD TO HUNT FOR IT WITH A
SPY GLASS
NOTHING WAS LEFT OF IT BUT AN INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE TUFT AND
THIS WAS NO LONGER NEAR THE KENTUCKY SHORE IT WAS CLEAR OVER AGAINST
THE OPPOSITE SHORE A MILE AWAY
IN WAR TIMES THE ISLAND HAD BEEN AN
IMPORTANT PLACE FOR IT COMMANDED THE SITUATION AND BEING HEAVILY
FORTIFIED THERE WAS NO GETTING BY IT
IT LAY BETWEEN THE UPPER AND
LOWER DIVISIONS OF THE UNION FORCES AND KEPT THEM SEPARATE UNTIL A
JUNCTION WAS FINALLY EFFECTED ACROSS THE MISSOURI NECK OF LAND BUT THE
ISLAND BEING ITSELF JOINED TO THAT NECK NOW THE WIDE RIVER IS WITHOUT
OBSTRUCTION
IN THIS REGION THE RIVER PASSES FROM KENTUCKY INTO TENNESSEE BACK INTO
MISSOURI THEN BACK INTO KENTUCKY AND THENCE INTO TENNESSEE AGAIN
SO A
MILE OR TWO OF MISSOURI STICKS OVER INTO TENNESSEE
THE TOWN OF NEW MADRID WAS LOOKING VERY UNWELL BUT OTHERWISE UNCHANGED
FROM ITS FORMER CONDITION AND ASPECT
ITS BLOCKS OF FRAME HOUSES WERE
STILL GROUPED IN THE SAME OLD FLAT PLAIN AND ENVIRONED BY THE SAME
OLD FORESTS
IT WAS AS TRANQUIL AS FORMERLY AND APPARENTLY HAD NEITHER
GROWN NOR DIMINISHED IN SIZE
IT WAS SAID THAT THE RECENT HIGH WATER HAD
INVADED IT AND DAMAGED ITS LOOKS
THIS WAS SURPRISING NEWS FOR IN LOW
WATER THE RIVER BANK IS VERY HIGH THERE FIFTY FEET AND IN MY DAY AN
OVERFLOW HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED AN IMPOSSIBILITY
THIS PRESENT FLOOD
OF 1882 WILL DOUBTLESS BE CELEBRATED IN THE RIVER'S HISTORY FOR SEVERAL
GENERATIONS BEFORE A DELUGE OF LIKE MAGNITUDE SHALL BE SEEN
IT PUT ALL
THE UNPROTECTED LOW LANDS UNDER WATER FROM CAIRO TO THE MOUTH IT BROKE
DOWN THE LEVEES IN A GREAT MANY PLACES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER
AND IN SOME REGIONS SOUTH WHEN THE FLOOD WAS AT ITS HIGHEST THE
MISSISSIPPI WAS SEVENTY MILES WIDE A NUMBER OF LIVES WERE LOST
AND THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY WAS FEARFUL
THE CROPS WERE DESTROYED
HOUSES WASHED AWAY AND SHELTERLESS MEN AND CATTLE FORCED TO TAKE REFUGE
ON SCATTERING ELEVATIONS HERE AND THERE IN FIELD AND FOREST AND WAIT
IN PERIL AND SUFFERING UNTIL THE BOATS PUT IN COMMISSION BY THE NATIONAL
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BY NEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE COULD COME AND RESCUE
THEM
THE PROPERTIES OF MULTITUDES OF PEOPLE WERE UNDER WATER FOR
MONTHS AND THE POORER ONES MUST HAVE STARVED BY THE HUNDRED IF SUCCOR
HAD NOT BEEN PROMPTLY AFFORDED FOOTNOTE FOR A DETAILED AND INTERESTING
DESCRIPTION OF THE GREAT FLOOD WRITTEN ON BOARD OF THE NEW ORLEANS
TIMES DEMOCRAT'S RELIEF BOAT SEE APPENDIX A THE WATER HAD BEEN
FALLING DURING A CONSIDERABLE TIME NOW YET AS A RULE WE FOUND THE BANKS
STILL UNDER WATER
CHAPTER 27
SOME IMPORTED ARTICLES
WE MET TWO STEAMBOATS AT NEW MADRID
TWO STEAMBOATS IN SIGHT AT ONCE AN
INFREQUENT SPECTACLE NOW IN THE LONESOME MISSISSIPPI
THE LONELINESS
OF THIS SOLEMN STUPENDOUS FLOOD IS IMPRESSIVE AND DEPRESSING
LEAGUE
AFTER LEAGUE AND STILL LEAGUE AFTER LEAGUE IT POURS ITS CHOCOLATE TIDE
ALONG BETWEEN ITS SOLID FOREST WALLS ITS ALMOST UNTENANTED SHORES
WITH SELDOM A SAIL OR A MOVING OBJECT OF ANY KIND TO DISTURB THE SURFACE
AND BREAK THE MONOTONY OF THE BLANK WATERY SOLITUDE AND SO THE DAY
GOES THE NIGHT COMES AND AGAIN THE DAY AND STILL THE SAME NIGHT
AFTER NIGHT AND DAY AFTER DAY MAJESTIC UNCHANGING SAMENESS OF
SERENITY REPOSE TRANQUILLITY LETHARGY VACANCY SYMBOL OF ETERNITY
REALIZATION OF THE HEAVEN PICTURED BY PRIEST AND PROPHET AND LONGED FOR
BY THE GOOD AND THOUGHTLESS
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WAR OF 1812 TOURISTS BEGAN TO COME TO AMERICA
FROM ENGLAND SCATTERING ONES AT FIRST THEN A SORT OF PROCESSION OF
THEM A PROCESSION WHICH KEPT UP ITS PLODDING PATIENT MARCH THROUGH THE
LAND DURING MANY MANY YEARS
EACH TOURIST TOOK NOTES AND WENT HOME AND
PUBLISHED A BOOK A BOOK WHICH WAS USUALLY CALM TRUTHFUL REASONABLE
KIND BUT WHICH SEEMED JUST THE REVERSE TO OUR TENDER FOOTED
PROGENITORS
A GLANCE AT THESE TOURIST BOOKS SHOWS US THAT IN CERTAIN
OF ITS ASPECTS THE MISSISSIPPI HAS UNDERGONE NO CHANGE SINCE THOSE
STRANGERS VISITED IT BUT REMAINS TO DAY ABOUT AS IT WAS THEN
THE
EMOTIONS PRODUCED IN THOSE FOREIGN BREASTS BY THESE ASPECTS WERE NOT
ALL FORMED ON ONE PATTERN OF COURSE THEY HAD TO BE VARIOUS ALONG
AT FIRST BECAUSE THE EARLIER TOURISTS WERE OBLIGED TO ORIGINATE THEIR
EMOTIONS WHEREAS IN OLDER COUNTRIES ONE CAN ALWAYS BORROW EMOTIONS
FROM ONE'S PREDECESSORS
AND MIND YOU EMOTIONS ARE AMONG THE TOUGHEST
THINGS IN THE WORLD TO MANUFACTURE OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH IT IS EASIER
TO MANUFACTURE SEVEN FACTS THAN ONE EMOTION
CAPTAIN BASIL HALL
R N
WRITING FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO SAYS
'HERE I CAUGHT THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OBJECT I HAD SO LONG WISHED TO
BEHOLD AND FELT MYSELF AMPLY REPAID AT THAT MOMENT FOR ALL THE TROUBLE
I HAD EXPERIENCED IN COMING SO FAR AND STOOD LOOKING AT THE RIVER
FLOWING PAST TILL IT WAS TOO DARK TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING
BUT IT WAS
NOT TILL I HAD VISITED THE SAME SPOT A DOZEN TIMES THAT I CAME TO A
RIGHT COMPREHENSION OF THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE
FOLLOWING ARE MRS
TROLLOPE'S EMOTIONS
SHE IS WRITING A FEW MONTHS
LATER IN THE SAME YEAR 1827 AND IS COMING IN AT THE MOUTH OF THE
MISSISSIPPI
'THE FIRST INDICATION OF OUR APPROACH TO LAND WAS THE APPEARANCE OF THIS
MIGHTY RIVER POURING FORTH ITS MUDDY MASS OF WATERS AND MINGLING WITH
THE DEEP BLUE OF THE MEXICAN GULF
I NEVER BEHELD A SCENE SO UTTERLY
DESOLATE AS THIS ENTRANCE OF THE MISSISSIPPI
HAD DANTE SEEN IT HE
MIGHT HAVE DRAWN IMAGES OF ANOTHER BORGIA FROM ITS HORRORS
ONE ONLY
OBJECT REARS ITSELF ABOVE THE EDDYING WATERS THIS IS THE MAST OF A
VESSEL LONG SINCE WRECKED IN ATTEMPTING TO CROSS THE BAR AND IT STILL
STANDS A DISMAL WITNESS OF THE DESTRUCTION THAT HAS BEEN AND A BODING
PROPHET OF THAT WHICH IS TO COME
EMOTIONS OF HON
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MURRAY NEAR ST
LOUIS SEVEN YEARS
LATER
'IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU ASCEND THE MIGHTY CURRENT FOR FIFTY OR A HUNDRED
MILES AND USE THE EYE OF IMAGINATION AS WELL AS THAT OF NATURE
THAT YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND ALL HIS MIGHT AND MAJESTY
YOU SEE HIM
FERTILIZING A BOUNDLESS VALLEY BEARING ALONG IN HIS COURSE THE TROPHIES
OF HIS THOUSAND VICTORIES OVER THE SHATTERED FOREST HERE CARRYING AWAY
LARGE MASSES OF SOIL WITH ALL THEIR GROWTH AND THERE FORMING ISLANDS
DESTINED AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD TO BE THE RESIDENCE OF MAN AND WHILE
INDULGING IN THIS PROSPECT IT IS THEN TIME FOR REFLECTION TO SUGGEST
THAT THE CURRENT BEFORE YOU HAS FLOWED THROUGH TWO OR THREE THOUSAND
MILES AND HAS YET TO TRAVEL ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MORE BEFORE
REACHING ITS OCEAN DESTINATION
RECEIVE NOW THE EMOTIONS OF CAPTAIN MARRYAT R N
AUTHOR OF THE SEA
TALES WRITING IN 1837 THREE YEARS AFTER MR
MURRAY
'NEVER PERHAPS IN THE RECORDS OF NATIONS WAS THERE AN INSTANCE OF A
CENTURY OF SUCH UNVARYING AND UNMITIGATED CRIME AS IS TO BE COLLECTED
FROM THE HISTORY OF THE TURBULENT AND BLOOD STAINED MISSISSIPPI
THE
STREAM ITSELF APPEARS AS IF APPROPRIATE FOR THE DEEDS WHICH HAVE BEEN
COMMITTED
IT IS NOT LIKE MOST RIVERS BEAUTIFUL TO THE SIGHT BESTOWING
FERTILITY IN ITS COURSE NOT ONE THAT THE EYE LOVES TO DWELL UPON AS
IT SWEEPS ALONG NOR CAN YOU WANDER UPON ITS BANKS OR TRUST YOURSELF
WITHOUT DANGER TO ITS STREAM
IT IS A FURIOUS RAPID DESOLATING
TORRENT LOADED WITH ALLUVIAL SOIL AND FEW OF THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVED
INTO ITS WATERS EVER RISE AGAIN FOOTNOTE THERE WAS A FOOLISH
SUPERSTITION OF SOME LITTLE PREVALENCE IN THAT DAY THAT THE MISSISSIPPI
WOULD NEITHER BUOY UP A SWIMMER NOR PERMIT A DROWNED PERSON'S BODY TO
RISE TO THE SURFACE OR CAN SUPPORT THEMSELVES LONG UPON ITS SURFACE
WITHOUT ASSISTANCE FROM SOME FRIENDLY LOG
IT CONTAINS THE COARSEST AND
MOST UNEATABLE OF FISH SUCH AS THE CAT FISH AND SUCH GENUS AND AS
YOU DESCEND ITS BANKS ARE OCCUPIED WITH THE FETID ALLIGATOR WHILE THE
PANTHER BASKS AT ITS EDGE IN THE CANE BRAKES ALMOST IMPERVIOUS TO MAN
POURING ITS IMPETUOUS WATERS THROUGH WILD TRACKS COVERED WITH TREES OF
LITTLE VALUE EXCEPT FOR FIREWOOD IT SWEEPS DOWN WHOLE FORESTS IN ITS
COURSE WHICH DISAPPEAR IN TUMULTUOUS CONFUSION WHIRLED AWAY BY THE
STREAM NOW LOADED WITH THE MASSES OF SOIL WHICH NOURISHED THEIR ROOTS
OFTEN BLOCKING UP AND CHANGING FOR A TIME THE CHANNEL OF THE RIVER
WHICH AS IF IN ANGER AT ITS BEING OPPOSED INUNDATES AND DEVASTATES THE
WHOLE COUNTRY ROUND AND AS SOON AS IT FORCES ITS WAY THROUGH ITS FORMER
CHANNEL PLANTS IN EVERY DIRECTION THE UPROOTED MONARCHS OF THE FOREST
UPON WHOSE BRANCHES THE BIRD WILL NEVER AGAIN PERCH OR THE RACCOON
THE OPOSSUM OR THE SQUIRREL CLIMB AS TRAPS TO THE ADVENTUROUS
NAVIGATORS OF ITS WATERS BY STEAM WHO BORNE DOWN UPON THESE CONCEALED
DANGERS WHICH PIERCE THROUGH THE PLANKS VERY OFTEN HAVE NOT TIME TO
STEER FOR AND GAIN THE SHORE BEFORE THEY SINK TO THE BOTTOM
THERE ARE
NO PLEASING ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT COMMON SEWER OF
THE WESTERN AMERICA WHICH POURS OUT ITS MUD INTO THE MEXICAN GULF
POLLUTING THE CLEAR BLUE SEA FOR MANY MILES BEYOND ITS MOUTH
IT IS A
RIVER OF DESOLATION AND INSTEAD OF REMINDING YOU LIKE OTHER BEAUTIFUL
RIVERS OF AN ANGEL WHICH HAS DESCENDED FOR THE BENEFIT OF MAN YOU
IMAGINE IT A DEVIL WHOSE ENERGIES HAVE BEEN ONLY OVERCOME BY THE
WONDERFUL POWER OF STEAM
IT IS PRETTY CRUDE LITERATURE FOR A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO HANDLING A PEN
STILL AS A PANORAMA OF THE EMOTIONS SENT WELTERING THROUGH THIS NOTED
VISITOR'S BREAST BY THE ASPECT AND TRADITIONS OF THE 'GREAT COMMON
SEWER IT HAS A VALUE
A VALUE THOUGH MARRED IN THE MATTER OF
STATISTICS BY INACCURACIES FOR THE CATFISH IS A PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH FISH
FOR ANYBODY AND THERE ARE NO PANTHERS THAT ARE 'IMPERVIOUS TO MAN
LATER STILL COMES ALEXANDER MACKAY OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE BARRISTER AT
LAW WITH A BETTER DIGESTION AND NO CATFISH DINNER ABOARD AND FEELS AS
FOLLOWS
'THE MISSISSIPPI IT WAS WITH INDESCRIBABLE EMOTIONS THAT I FIRST FELT
MYSELF AFLOAT UPON ITS WATERS
HOW OFTEN IN MY SCHOOLBOY DREAMS AND IN
MY WAKING VISIONS AFTERWARDS HAD MY IMAGINATION PICTURED TO ITSELF THE
LORDLY STREAM ROLLING WITH TUMULTUOUS CURRENT THROUGH THE BOUNDLESS
REGION TO WHICH IT HAS GIVEN ITS NAME AND GATHERING INTO ITSELF IN ITS
COURSE TO THE OCEAN THE TRIBUTARY WATERS OF ALMOST EVERY LATITUDE IN
THE TEMPERATE ZONE HERE IT WAS THEN IN ITS REALITY AND I AT LENGTH
STEAMING AGAINST ITS TIDE
I LOOKED UPON IT WITH THAT REVERENCE WITH
WHICH EVERYONE MUST REGARD A GREAT FEATURE OF EXTERNAL NATURE
SO MUCH FOR THE EMOTIONS
THE TOURISTS ONE AND ALL REMARK UPON THE
DEEP BROODING LONELINESS AND DESOLATION OF THE VAST RIVER
CAPTAIN
BASIL HALL WHO SAW IT AT FLOOD STAGE SAYS
'SOMETIMES WE PASSED ALONG DISTANCES OF TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES WITHOUT
SEEING A SINGLE HABITATION
AN ARTIST IN SEARCH OF HINTS FOR A PAINTING
OF THE DELUGE WOULD HERE HAVE FOUND THEM IN ABUNDANCE
THE FIRST SHALL BE LAST ETC
JUST TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE OLD
ORIGINAL FIRST AND GALLANTEST OF ALL THE FOREIGN TOURISTS PIONEER HEAD
OF THE PROCESSION ENDED HIS WEARY AND TEDIOUS DISCOVERY VOYAGE DOWN THE
SOLEMN STRETCHES OF THE GREAT RIVER LA SALLE WHOSE NAME WILL LAST AS
LONG AS THE RIVER ITSELF SHALL LAST
WE QUOTE FROM MR
PARKMAN
'AND NOW THEY NEARED THEIR JOURNEY'S END
ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL THE
RIVER DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE BROAD CHANNELS
LA SALLE FOLLOWED THAT
OF THE WEST AND D'AUTRAY THAT OF THE EAST WHILE TONTY TOOK THE MIDDLE
PASSAGE
AS HE DRIFTED DOWN THE TURBID CURRENT BETWEEN THE LOW AND
MARSHY SHORES THE BRACKISH WATER CHANGED TO BRINE AND THE BREEZE GREW
FRESH WITH THE SALT BREATH OF THE SEA
THEN THE BROAD BOSOM OF THE
GREAT GULF OPENED ON HIS SIGHT TOSSING ITS RESTLESS BILLOWS LIMITLESS
VOICELESS LONELY AS WHEN BORN OF CHAOS WITHOUT A SAIL WITHOUT A SIGN
OF LIFE
THEN ON A SPOT OF SOLID GROUND LA SALLE REARED A COLUMN 'BEARING THE
ARMS OF FRANCE THE FRENCHMEN WERE MUSTERED UNDER ARMS AND WHILE THE
NEW ENGLAND INDIANS AND THEIR SQUAWS LOOKED ON IN WONDERING SILENCE
THEY CHANTED THE TE DEUM THE EXAUDIAT AND THE DOMINE SALVUM FAC

THEN WHILST THE MUSKETRY VOLLEYED AND REJOICING SHOUTS BURST FORTH
THE VICTORIOUS DISCOVERER PLANTED THE COLUMN AND MADE PROCLAMATION IN A

NEW ORLEANS INTENDED TO FITTINGLY CELEBRATE THIS PRESENT YEAR THE
BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THIS ILLUSTRIOUS EVENT BUT WHEN THE
TIME CAME ALL HER ENERGIES AND SURPLUS MONEY WERE REQUIRED IN OTHER
DIRECTIONS FOR THE FLOOD WAS UPON THE LAND THEN MAKING HAVOC AND
DEVASTATION EVERYWHERE
CHAPTER 28
UNCLE MUMFORD UNLOADS
ALL DAY WE SWUNG ALONG DOWN THE RIVER AND HAD THE STREAM ALMOST WHOLLY
TO OURSELVES
FORMERLY AT SUCH A STAGE OF THE WATER WE SHOULD HAVE
PASSED ACRES OF LUMBER RAFTS AND DOZENS OF BIG COAL BARGES ALSO
OCCASIONAL LITTLE TRADING SCOWS PEDDLING ALONG FROM FARM TO FARM WITH
THE PEDDLER'S FAMILY ON BOARD POSSIBLY A RANDOM SCOW BEARING A HUMBLE
HAMLET AND CO
ON AN ITINERANT DRAMATIC TRIP
BUT THESE WERE ALL ABSENT
FAR ALONG IN THE DAY WE SAW ONE STEAMBOAT JUST ONE AND NO MORE
SHE
WAS LYING AT REST IN THE SHADE WITHIN THE WOODED MOUTH OF THE OBION
RIVER
THE SPY GLASS REVEALED THE FACT THAT SHE WAS NAMED FOR ME OR
HE WAS NAMED FOR ME WHICHEVER YOU PREFER
AS THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
I HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED THIS SPECIES OF HONOR IT SEEMS EXCUSABLE TO
MENTION IT AND AT THE SAME TIME CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE AUTHORITIES
TO THE TARDINESS OF MY RECOGNITION OF IT
NOTED A BIG CHANGE IN THE RIVER AT ISLAND 21
IT WAS A VERY LARGE
ISLAND AND USED TO BE OUT TOWARD MID STREAM BUT IT IS JOINED FAST TO
THE MAIN SHORE NOW AND HAS RETIRED FROM BUSINESS AS AN ISLAND
AS WE APPROACHED FAMOUS AND FORMIDABLE PLUM POINT DARKNESS FELL BUT
THAT WAS NOTHING TO SHUDDER ABOUT IN THESE MODERN TIMES
FOR NOW
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED THE MISSISSIPPI INTO A SORT OF
TWO THOUSAND MILE TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
IN THE HEAD OF EVERY CROSSING
AND IN THE FOOT OF EVERY CROSSING THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET UP A
CLEAR BURNING LAMP
YOU ARE NEVER ENTIRELY IN THE DARK NOW THERE IS
ALWAYS A BEACON IN SIGHT EITHER BEFORE YOU OR BEHIND YOU OR ABREAST
ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THAT LAMPS HAVE BEEN SQUANDERED THERE
DOZENS OF
CROSSINGS ARE LIGHTED WHICH WERE NOT SHOAL WHEN THEY WERE CREATED
AND HAVE NEVER BEEN SHOAL SINCE CROSSINGS SO PLAIN TOO AND ALSO SO
STRAIGHT THAT A STEAMBOAT CAN TAKE HERSELF THROUGH THEM WITHOUT ANY
HELP AFTER SHE HAS BEEN THROUGH ONCE
LAMPS IN SUCH PLACES ARE OF
COURSE NOT WASTED IT IS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AND COMFORTABLE FOR A
PILOT TO HOLD ON THEM THAN ON A SPREAD OF FORMLESS BLACKNESS THAT WON'T
STAY STILL AND MONEY IS SAVED TO THE BOAT AT THE SAME TIME FOR SHE
CAN OF COURSE MAKE MORE MILES WITH HER RUDDER AMIDSHIPS THAN SHE CAN
WITH IT SQUARED ACROSS HER STERN AND HOLDING HER BACK
BUT THIS THING HAS KNOCKED THE ROMANCE OUT OF PILOTING TO A LARGE
EXTENT
IT AND SOME OTHER THINGS TOGETHER HAVE KNOCKED ALL THE ROMANCE
OUT OF IT
FOR INSTANCE THE PERIL FROM SNAGS IS NOT NOW WHAT IT ONCE
WAS
THE GOVERNMENT'S SNAG BOATS GO PATROLLING UP AND DOWN IN THESE
MATTER OF FACT DAYS PULLING THE RIVER'S TEETH THEY HAVE ROOTED OUT
ALL THE OLD CLUSTERS WHICH MADE MANY LOCALITIES SO FORMIDABLE AND THEY
ALLOW NO NEW ONES TO COLLECT
FORMERLY IF YOUR BOAT GOT AWAY FROM YOU
ON A BLACK NIGHT AND BROKE FOR THE WOODS IT WAS AN ANXIOUS TIME WITH
YOU SO WAS IT ALSO WHEN YOU WERE GROPING YOUR WAY THROUGH SOLIDIFIED
DARKNESS IN A NARROW CHUTE BUT ALL THAT IS CHANGED NOW YOU FLASH OUT
YOUR ELECTRIC LIGHT TRANSFORM NIGHT INTO DAY IN THE TWINKLING OF AN
EYE AND YOUR PERILS AND ANXIETIES ARE AT AN END
HORACE BIXBY AND
GEORGE RITCHIE HAVE CHARTED THE CROSSINGS AND LAID OUT THE COURSES
BY COMPASS THEY HAVE INVENTED A LAMP TO GO WITH THE CHART AND HAVE
PATENTED THE WHOLE
WITH THESE HELPS ONE MAY RUN IN THE FOG NOW WITH
CONSIDERABLE SECURITY AND WITH A CONFIDENCE UNKNOWN IN THE OLD DAYS
WITH THESE ABUNDANT BEACONS THE BANISHMENT OF SNAGS PLENTY OF DAYLIGHT
IN A BOX AND READY TO BE TURNED ON WHENEVER NEEDED AND A CHART AND
COMPASS TO FIGHT THE FOG WITH PILOTING AT A GOOD STAGE OF WATER IS
NOW NEARLY AS SAFE AND SIMPLE AS DRIVING STAGE AND IS HARDLY MORE THAN
THREE TIMES AS ROMANTIC
AND NOW IN THESE NEW DAYS THESE DAYS OF INFINITE CHANGE THE ANCHOR
LINE HAVE RAISED THE CAPTAIN ABOVE THE PILOT BY GIVING HIM THE BIGGER
WAGES OF THE TWO
THIS WAS GOING FAR BUT THEY HAVE NOT STOPPED THERE
THEY HAVE DECREED THAT THE PILOT SHALL REMAIN AT HIS POST AND STAND
HIS WATCH CLEAR THROUGH WHETHER THE BOAT BE UNDER WAY OR TIED UP TO THE
SHORE
WE THAT WERE ONCE THE ARISTOCRATS OF THE RIVER CAN'T GO TO BED
NOW AS WE USED TO DO AND SLEEP WHILE A HUNDRED TONS OF FREIGHT ARE
LUGGED ABOARD NO WE MUST SIT IN THE PILOT HOUSE AND KEEP AWAKE TOO
VERILY WE ARE BEING TREATED LIKE A PARCEL OF MATES AND ENGINEERS
THE
GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN AWAY THE ROMANCE OF OUR CALLING THE COMPANY HAS
TAKEN AWAY ITS STATE AND DIGNITY
PLUM POINT LOOKED AS IT HAD ALWAYS LOOKED BY NIGHT WITH THE EXCEPTION
THAT NOW THERE WERE BEACONS TO MARK THE CROSSINGS AND ALSO A LOT OF
OTHER LIGHTS ON THE POINT AND ALONG ITS SHORE THESE LATTER GLINTING
FROM THE FLEET OF THE UNITED STATES RIVER COMMISSION AND FROM A VILLAGE
WHICH THE OFFICIALS HAVE BUILT ON THE LAND FOR OFFICES AND FOR THE
EMPLOYEES OF THE SERVICE
THE MILITARY ENGINEERS OF THE COMMISSION
HAVE TAKEN UPON THEIR SHOULDERS THE JOB OF MAKING THE MISSISSIPPI OVER
AGAIN A JOB TRANSCENDED IN SIZE BY ONLY THE ORIGINAL JOB OF CREATING
IT
THEY ARE BUILDING WING DAMS HERE AND THERE TO DEFLECT THE CURRENT
AND DIKES TO CONFINE IT IN NARROWER BOUNDS AND OTHER DIKES TO MAKE IT
STAY THERE AND FOR UNNUMBERED MILES ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI THEY ARE
FELLING THE TIMBER FRONT FOR FIFTY YARDS BACK WITH THE PURPOSE OF
SHAVING THE BANK DOWN TO LOW WATER MARK WITH THE SLANT OF A HOUSE ROOF
AND BALLASTING IT WITH STONES AND IN MANY PLACES THEY HAVE PROTECTED
THE WASTING SHORES WITH ROWS OF PILES
ONE WHO KNOWS THE MISSISSIPPI
WILL PROMPTLY AVER NOT ALOUD BUT TO HIMSELF THAT TEN THOUSAND RIVER
COMMISSIONS WITH THE MINES OF THE WORLD AT THEIR BACK CANNOT TAME THAT
LAWLESS STREAM CANNOT CURB IT OR CONFINE IT CANNOT SAY TO IT GO
HERE OR GO THERE AND MAKE IT OBEY CANNOT SAVE A SHORE WHICH IT HAS
SENTENCED CANNOT BAR ITS PATH WITH AN OBSTRUCTION WHICH IT WILL NOT
TEAR DOWN DANCE OVER AND LAUGH AT
BUT A DISCREET MAN WILL NOT PUT
THESE THINGS INTO SPOKEN WORDS FOR THE WEST POINT ENGINEERS HAVE NOT
THEIR SUPERIORS ANYWHERE THEY KNOW ALL THAT CAN BE KNOWN OF THEIR
ABSTRUSE SCIENCE AND SO SINCE THEY CONCEIVE THAT THEY CAN FETTER AND
HANDCUFF THAT RIVER AND BOSS HIM IT IS BUT WISDOM FOR THE UNSCIENTIFIC
MAN TO KEEP STILL LIE LOW AND WAIT TILL THEY DO IT
CAPTAIN EADS
WITH HIS JETTIES HAS DONE A WORK AT THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI WHICH
SEEMED CLEARLY IMPOSSIBLE SO WE DO NOT FEEL FULL CONFIDENCE NOW TO
PROPHESY AGAINST LIKE IMPOSSIBILITIES
OTHERWISE ONE WOULD PIPE OUT AND
SAY THE COMMISSION MIGHT AS WELL BULLY THE COMETS IN THEIR COURSES AND
UNDERTAKE TO MAKE THEM BEHAVE AS TRY TO BULLY THE MISSISSIPPI INTO
RIGHT AND REASONABLE CONDUCT
I CONSULTED UNCLE MUMFORD CONCERNING THIS AND COGNATE MATTERS AND I
GIVE HERE THE RESULT STENOGRAPHICALLY REPORTED AND THEREFORE TO BE
RELIED ON AS BEING FULL AND CORRECT EXCEPT THAT I HAVE HERE AND THERE
LEFT OUT REMARKS WHICH WERE ADDRESSED TO THE MEN SUCH AS 'WHERE IN
BLAZES ARE YOU GOING WITH THAT BARREL NOW AND WHICH SEEMED TO ME TO
BREAK THE FLOW OF THE WRITTEN STATEMENT WITHOUT COMPENSATING BY ADDING
TO ITS INFORMATION OR ITS CLEARNESS
NOT THAT I HAVE VENTURED TO
STRIKE OUT ALL SUCH INTERJECTIONS I HAVE REMOVED ONLY THOSE WHICH WERE
OBVIOUSLY IRRELEVANT WHEREVER ONE OCCURRED WHICH I FELT ANY QUESTION
ABOUT I HAVE JUDGED IT SAFEST TO LET IT REMAIN
UNCLE MUMFORD'S IMPRESSIONS
UNCLE MUMFORD SAID
'AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN MATE OF A STEAMBOAT THIRTY YEARS I HAVE
WATCHED THIS RIVER AND STUDIED IT
MAYBE I COULD HAVE LEARNT MORE ABOUT
IT AT WEST POINT BUT IF I BELIEVE IT I WISH I MAY BE WHAT ARE YOU
SUCKING YOUR FINGERS THERE FOR COLLAR THAT KAG OF NAILS FOUR YEARS
AT WEST POINT AND PLENTY OF BOOKS AND SCHOOLING WILL LEARN A MAN A
GOOD DEAL I RECKON BUT IT WON'T LEARN HIM THE RIVER
YOU TURN ONE
OF THOSE LITTLE EUROPEAN RIVERS OVER TO THIS COMMISSION WITH ITS HARD
BOTTOM AND CLEAR WATER AND IT WOULD JUST BE A HOLIDAY JOB FOR THEM TO
WALL IT AND PILE IT AND DIKE IT AND TAME IT DOWN AND BOSS IT AROUND
AND MAKE IT GO WHEREVER THEY WANTED IT TO AND STAY WHERE THEY PUT IT
AND DO JUST AS THEY SAID EVERY TIME
BUT THIS AIN'T THAT KIND OF A
RIVER
THEY HAVE STARTED IN HERE WITH BIG CONFIDENCE AND THE BEST
INTENTIONS IN THE WORLD BUT THEY ARE GOING TO GET LEFT
WHAT DOES
ECCLESIASTES VII
13 SAY SAYS ENOUGH TO KNOCK THEIR LITTLE GAME
GALLEY WEST DON'T IT NOW YOU LOOK AT THEIR METHODS ONCE
THERE AT
DEVIL'S ISLAND IN THE UPPER RIVER THEY WANTED THE WATER TO GO ONE WAY
THE WATER WANTED TO GO ANOTHER
SO THEY PUT UP A STONE WALL
BUT WHAT
DOES THE RIVER CARE FOR A STONE WALL WHEN IT GOT READY IT JUST BULGED
THROUGH IT
MAYBE THEY CAN BUILD ANOTHER THAT WILL STAY THAT IS UP
THERE BUT NOT DOWN HERE THEY CAN'T
DOWN HERE IN THE LOWER RIVER THEY
DRIVE SOME PEGS TO TURN THE WATER AWAY FROM THE SHORE AND STOP IT FROM
SLICING OFF THE BANK VERY WELL DON'T IT GO STRAIGHT OVER AND CUT
SOMEBODY ELSE'S BANK CERTAINLY
ARE THEY GOING TO PEG ALL THE BANKS
WHY THEY COULD BUY GROUND AND BUILD A NEW MISSISSIPPI CHEAPER
THEY ARE
PEGGING BULLETIN TOW HEAD NOW
IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD
IF THE RIVER HAS
GOT A MORTGAGE ON THAT ISLAND IT WILL FORECLOSE SURE PEGS OR NO PEGS
AWAY DOWN YONDER THEY HAVE DRIVEN TWO ROWS OF PILES STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE MIDDLE OF A DRY BAR HALF A MILE LONG WHICH IS FORTY FOOT OUT OF THE
WATER WHEN THE RIVER IS LOW
WHAT DO YOU RECKON THAT IS FOR IF I KNOW
I WISH I MAY LAND IN HUMP YOURSELF YOU SON OF AN UNDERTAKER OUT
WITH THAT COAL OIL NOW LIVELY LIVELY AND JUST LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE
TRYING TO DO DOWN THERE AT MILLIKEN'S BEND
THERE'S BEEN A CUT OFF IN
THAT SECTION AND VICKSBURG IS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD
IT'S A COUNTRY TOWN
NOW
THE RIVER STRIKES IN BELOW IT AND A BOAT CAN'T GO UP TO THE TOWN
EXCEPT IN HIGH WATER
WELL THEY ARE GOING TO BUILD WING DAMS IN THE
BEND OPPOSITE THE FOOT OF 103 AND THROW THE WATER OVER AND CUT OFF THE
FOOT OF THE ISLAND AND PLOW DOWN INTO AN OLD DITCH WHERE THE RIVER
USED TO BE IN ANCIENT TIMES AND THEY THINK THEY CAN PERSUADE THE WATER
AROUND THAT WAY AND GET IT TO STRIKE IN ABOVE VICKSBURG AS IT USED
TO DO AND FETCH THE TOWN BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
THAT IS THEY ARE
GOING TO TAKE THIS WHOLE MISSISSIPPI AND TWIST IT AROUND AND MAKE IT
RUN SEVERAL MILES UP STREAM
WELL YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIRE MEN THAT DEAL
IN IDEAS OF THAT SIZE AND CAN TOTE THEM AROUND WITHOUT CRUTCHES BUT YOU
HAVEN'T GOT TO BELIEVE THEY CAN DO SUCH MIRACLES HAVE YOU AND YET
YOU AIN'T ABSOLUTELY OBLIGED TO BELIEVE THEY CAN'T
I RECKON THE SAFE
WAY WHERE A MAN CAN AFFORD IT IS TO COPPER THE OPERATION AND AT THE
SAME TIME BUY ENOUGH PROPERTY IN VICKSBURG TO SQUARE YOU UP IN CASE THEY
WIN
GOVERNMENT IS DOING A DEAL FOR THE MISSISSIPPI NOW SPENDING LOADS
OF MONEY ON HER
WHEN THERE USED TO BE FOUR THOUSAND STEAMBOATS AND TEN
THOUSAND ACRES OF COAL BARGES AND RAFTS AND TRADING SCOWS THERE WASN'T
A LANTERN FROM ST
PAUL TO NEW ORLEANS AND THE SNAGS WERE THICKER THAN
BRISTLES ON A HOG'S BACK AND NOW WHEN THERE'S THREE DOZEN STEAMBOATS
AND NARY BARGE OR RAFT GOVERNMENT HAS SNATCHED OUT ALL THE SNAGS AND
LIT UP THE SHORES LIKE BROADWAY AND A BOAT'S AS SAFE ON THE RIVER AS
SHE'D BE IN HEAVEN
AND I RECKON THAT BY THE TIME THERE AIN'T ANY BOATS
LEFT AT ALL THE COMMISSION WILL HAVE THE OLD THING ALL REORGANIZED AND
DREDGED OUT AND FENCED IN AND TIDIED UP TO A DEGREE THAT WILL MAKE
NAVIGATION JUST SIMPLY PERFECT AND ABSOLUTELY SAFE AND PROFITABLE AND
ALL THE DAYS WILL BE SUNDAYS AND ALL THE MATES WILL BE SUNDAY SCHOOL
SU WHAT IN THE NATION YOU FOOLING AROUND THERE FOR YOU SONS OF
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS HEIRS OF PERDITION GOING TO BE A YEAR GETTING THAT
HOGSHEAD ASHORE
DURING OUR TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS AND BACK WE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS
WITH RIVER MEN PLANTERS JOURNALISTS AND OFFICERS OF THE RIVER
COMMISSION WITH CONFLICTING AND CONFUSING RESULTS
TO WIT
1
SOME BELIEVED IN THE COMMISSION'S SCHEME TO ARBITRARILY AND
PERMANENTLY CONFINE AND THUS DEEPEN THE CHANNEL PRESERVE THREATENED
SHORES ETC
2
SOME BELIEVED THAT THE COMMISSION'S MONEY OUGHT TO BE SPENT ONLY ON
BUILDING AND REPAIRING THE GREAT SYSTEM OF LEVEES
3
SOME BELIEVED THAT THE HIGHER YOU BUILD YOUR LEVEE THE HIGHER THE
RIVER'S BOTTOM WILL RISE AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE LEVEE SYSTEM IS A
MISTAKE
4
SOME BELIEVED IN THE SCHEME TO RELIEVE THE RIVER IN FLOOD TIME BY
TURNING ITS SURPLUS WATERS OFF INTO LAKE BORGNE ETC
5
SOME BELIEVED IN THE SCHEME OF NORTHERN LAKE RESERVOIRS TO REPLENISH
THE MISSISSIPPI IN LOW WATER SEASONS
WHEREVER YOU FIND A MAN DOWN THERE WHO BELIEVES IN ONE OF THESE THEORIES
YOU MAY TURN TO THE NEXT MAN AND FRAME YOUR TALK UPON THE HYPOTHESIS
THAT HE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THAT THEORY AND AFTER YOU HAVE HAD
EXPERIENCE YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE DOUBTFULLY OR HESITATINGLY BUT
WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF A DYING MURDERER CONVERTED ONE I MEAN
FOR YOU
WILL HAVE COME TO KNOW WITH A DEEP AND RESTFUL CERTAINTY THAT YOU ARE
NOT GOING TO MEET TWO PEOPLE SICK OF THE SAME THEORY ONE RIGHT AFTER
THE OTHER
NO THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OR TWO WITH THE OTHER DISEASES
ALONG BETWEEN
AND AS YOU PROCEED YOU WILL FIND OUT ONE OR TWO OTHER
THINGS
YOU WILL FIND OUT THAT THERE IS NO DISTEMPER OF THE LOT BUT IS
CONTAGIOUS AND YOU CANNOT GO WHERE IT IS WITHOUT CATCHING IT
YOU MAY
VACCINATE YOURSELF WITH DETERRENT FACTS AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE IT WILL
DO NO GOOD IT WILL SEEM TO 'TAKE BUT IT DOESN'T THE MOMENT YOU RUB
AGAINST ANY ONE OF THOSE THEORISTS MAKE UP YOUR MIND THAT IT IS TIME TO
HANG OUT YOUR YELLOW FLAG
YES YOU ARE HIS SURE VICTIM YET HIS WORK IS NOT ALL TO YOUR HURT ONLY
PART OF IT FOR HE IS LIKE YOUR FAMILY PHYSICIAN WHO COMES AND CURES
THE MUMPS AND LEAVES THE SCARLET FEVER BEHIND
IF YOUR MAN IS A
LAKE BORGNE RELIEF THEORIST FOR INSTANCE HE WILL EXHALE A CLOUD OF
DEADLY FACTS AND STATISTICS WHICH WILL LAY YOU OUT WITH THAT DISEASE
SURE BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WILL CURE YOU OF ANY OTHER OF THE FIVE
THEORIES THAT MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY GOT INTO YOUR SYSTEM
I HAVE HAD ALL THE FIVE AND HAD THEM 'BAD BUT ASK ME NOT IN MOURNFUL
NUMBERS WHICH ONE RACKED ME HARDEST OR WHICH ONE NUMBERED THE BIGGEST
SICK LIST FOR I DO NOT KNOW
IN TRUTH NO ONE CAN ANSWER THE LATTER
QUESTION
MISSISSIPPI IMPROVEMENT IS A MIGHTY TOPIC DOWN YONDER
EVERY
MAN ON THE RIVER BANKS SOUTH OF CAIRO TALKS ABOUT IT EVERY DAY DURING
SUCH MOMENTS AS HE IS ABLE TO SPARE FROM TALKING ABOUT THE WAR AND EACH
OF THE SEVERAL CHIEF THEORIES HAS ITS HOST OF ZEALOUS PARTISANS BUT
AS I HAVE SAID IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHICH CAUSE NUMBERS THE
MOST RECRUITS
ALL WERE AGREED UPON ONE POINT HOWEVER IF CONGRESS WOULD MAKE A
SUFFICIENT APPROPRIATION A COLOSSAL BENEFIT WOULD RESULT
VERY WELL
SINCE THEN THE APPROPRIATION HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLY A SUFFICIENT ONE
CERTAINLY NOT TOO LARGE A ONE
LET US HOPE THAT THE PROPHECY WILL BE
AMPLY FULFILLED
ONE THING WILL BE EASILY GRANTED BY THE READER THAT AN OPINION FROM MR
EDWARD ATKINSON UPON ANY VAST NATIONAL COMMERCIAL MATTER COMES AS NEAR
RANKING AS AUTHORITY AS CAN THE OPINION OF ANY INDIVIDUAL IN THE UNION
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY ABOUT MISSISSIPPI RIVER IMPROVEMENT WILL BE FOUND IN
THE APPENDIX FOOTNOTE SEE APPENDIX B
SOMETIMES HALF A DOZEN FIGURES WILL REVEAL AS WITH A LIGHTNING FLASH
THE IMPORTANCE OF A SUBJECT WHICH TEN THOUSAND LABORED WORDS WITH THE
SAME PURPOSE IN VIEW HAD LEFT AT LAST BUT DIM AND UNCERTAIN
HERE IS A
CASE OF THE SORT PARAGRAPH FROM THE 'CINCINNATI COMMERCIAL'
'THE TOWBOAT JOS
B
WILLIAMS IS ON HER WAY TO NEW ORLEANS WITH A
TOW OF THIRTY TWO BARGES CONTAINING SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSHELS
SEVENTY SIX POUNDS TO THE BUSHEL OF COAL EXCLUSIVE OF HER OWN FUEL
BEING THE LARGEST TOW EVER TAKEN TO NEW ORLEANS OR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE
WORLD
HER FREIGHT BILL AT 3 CENTS A BUSHEL AMOUNTS TO 18 000
IT
WOULD TAKE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED CARS OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE
BUSHELS TO THE CAR TO TRANSPORT THIS AMOUNT OF COAL
AT 10 PER TON OR
100 PER CAR WHICH WOULD BE A FAIR PRICE FOR THE DISTANCE BY RAIL THE
FREIGHT BILL WOULD AMOUNT TO 180 000 OR 162 000 MORE BY RAIL THAN BY
RIVER
THE TOW WILL BE TAKEN FROM PITTSBURG TO NEW ORLEANS IN FOURTEEN
OR FIFTEEN DAYS
IT WOULD TAKE ONE HUNDRED TRAINS OF EIGHTEEN CARS TO
THE TRAIN TO TRANSPORT THIS ONE TOW OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BUSHELS
OF COAL AND EVEN IF IT MADE THE USUAL SPEED OF FAST FREIGHT LINES IT
WOULD TAKE ONE WHOLE SUMMER TO PUT IT THROUGH BY RAIL
WHEN A RIVER IN GOOD CONDITION CAN ENABLE ONE TO SAVE 162 000 AND A
WHOLE SUMMER'S TIME ON A SINGLE CARGO THE WISDOM OF TAKING MEASURES TO
KEEP THE RIVER IN GOOD CONDITION IS MADE PLAIN TO EVEN THE UNCOMMERCIAL
MIND
CHAPTER 29
A FEW SPECIMEN BRICKS
WE PASSED THROUGH THE PLUM POINT REGION TURNED CRAIGHEAD'S POINT
AND GLIDED UNCHALLENGED BY WHAT WAS ONCE THE FORMIDABLE FORT PILLOW
MEMORABLE BECAUSE OF THE MASSACRE PERPETRATED THERE DURING THE WAR
MASSACRES ARE SPRINKLED WITH SOME FREQUENCY THROUGH THE HISTORIES OF
SEVERAL CHRISTIAN NATIONS BUT THIS IS ALMOST THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN BE
FOUND IN AMERICAN HISTORY PERHAPS IT IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH RISES TO A
SIZE CORRESPONDENT TO THAT HUGE AND SOMBER TITLE
WE HAVE THE 'BOSTON
MASSACRE WHERE TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED BUT WE MUST BUNCH
ANGLO SAXON HISTORY TOGETHER TO FIND THE FELLOW TO THE FORT PILLOW
TRAGEDY AND DOUBTLESS EVEN THEN WE MUST TRAVEL BACK TO THE DAYS AND THE
PERFORMANCES OF COEUR DE LION THAT FINE 'HERO BEFORE WE ACCOMPLISH
IT
MORE OF THE RIVER'S FREAKS
IN TIMES PAST THE CHANNEL USED TO STRIKE
ABOVE ISLAND 37 BY BRANDYWINE BAR AND DOWN TOWARDS ISLAND 39
AFTERWARD CHANGED ITS COURSE AND WENT FROM BRANDYWINE DOWN THROUGH
VOGELMAN'S CHUTE IN THE DEVIL'S ELBOW TO ISLAND 39 PART OF THIS COURSE
REVERSING THE OLD ORDER THE RIVER RUNNING UP FOUR OR FIVE MILES
INSTEAD OF DOWN AND CUTTING OFF THROUGHOUT SOME FIFTEEN MILES OF
DISTANCE
THIS IN 1876
ALL THAT REGION IS NOW CALLED CENTENNIAL ISLAND
THERE IS A TRADITION THAT ISLAND 37 WAS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL ABIDING
PLACES OF THE ONCE CELEBRATED 'MUREL'S GANG THIS WAS A COLOSSAL
COMBINATION OF ROBBERS HORSE THIEVES NEGRO STEALERS AND
COUNTERFEITERS ENGAGED IN BUSINESS ALONG THE RIVER SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY
YEARS AGO
WHILE OUR JOURNEY ACROSS THE COUNTRY TOWARDS ST
LOUIS WAS IN
PROGRESS WE HAD HAD NO END OF JESSE JAMES AND HIS STIRRING HISTORY FOR
HE HAD JUST BEEN ASSASSINATED BY AN AGENT OF THE GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI
AND WAS IN CONSEQUENCE OCCUPYING A GOOD DEAL OF SPACE IN THE NEWSPAPERS
CHEAP HISTORIES OF HIM WERE FOR SALE BY TRAIN BOYS
ACCORDING TO THESE
HE WAS THE MOST MARVELOUS CREATURE OF HIS KIND THAT HAD EVER EXISTED
IT
WAS A MISTAKE
MUREL WAS HIS EQUAL IN BOLDNESS IN PLUCK IN RAPACITY
IN CRUELTY BRUTALITY HEARTLESSNESS TREACHERY AND IN GENERAL AND
COMPREHENSIVE VILENESS AND SHAMELESSNESS AND VERY MUCH HIS SUPERIOR
IN SOME LARGER ASPECTS
JAMES WAS A RETAIL RASCAL MUREL WHOLESALE
JAMES'S MODEST GENIUS DREAMED OF NO LOFTIER FLIGHT THAN THE PLANNING
OF RAIDS UPON CARS COACHES AND COUNTRY BANKS MUREL PROJECTED NEGRO
INSURRECTIONS AND THE CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS AND FURTHERMORE ON
OCCASION THIS MUREL COULD GO INTO A PULPIT AND EDIFY THE CONGREGATION
WHAT ARE JAMES AND HIS HALF DOZEN VULGAR RASCALS COMPARED WITH THIS
STATELY OLD TIME CRIMINAL WITH HIS SERMONS HIS MEDITATED INSURRECTIONS
AND CITY CAPTURES AND HIS MAJESTIC FOLLOWING OF TEN HUNDRED MEN SWORN
TO DO HIS EVIL WILL
HERE IS A PARAGRAPH OR TWO CONCERNING THIS BIG OPERATOR FROM A NOW
FORGOTTEN BOOK WHICH WAS PUBLISHED HALF A CENTURY AGO
HE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A MOST DEXTEROUS AS WELL AS CONSUMMATE VILLAIN
WHEN HE TRAVELED HIS USUAL DISGUISE WAS THAT OF AN ITINERANT PREACHER
AND IT IS SAID THAT HIS DISCOURSES WERE VERY 'SOUL MOVING' INTERESTING
THE HEARERS SO MUCH THAT THEY FORGOT TO LOOK AFTER THEIR HORSES WHICH
WERE CARRIED AWAY BY HIS CONFEDERATES WHILE HE WAS PREACHING
BUT THE
STEALING OF HORSES IN ONE STATE AND SELLING THEM IN ANOTHER WAS BUT
A SMALL PORTION OF THEIR BUSINESS THE MOST LUCRATIVE WAS THE ENTICING
SLAVES TO RUN AWAY FROM THEIR MASTERS THAT THEY MIGHT SELL THEM IN
ANOTHER QUARTER
THIS WAS ARRANGED AS FOLLOWS THEY WOULD TELL A NEGRO
THAT IF HE WOULD RUN AWAY FROM HIS MASTER AND ALLOW THEM TO SELL HIM
HE SHOULD RECEIVE A PORTION OF THE MONEY PAID FOR HIM AND THAT UPON HIS
RETURN TO THEM A SECOND TIME THEY WOULD SEND HIM TO A FREE STATE WHERE
HE WOULD BE SAFE
THE POOR WRETCHES COMPLIED WITH THIS REQUEST HOPING TO OBTAIN MONEY AND
FREEDOM THEY WOULD BE SOLD TO ANOTHER MASTER AND RUN AWAY AGAIN TO
THEIR EMPLOYERS SOMETIMES THEY WOULD BE SOLD IN THIS MANNER THREE OR
FOUR TIMES UNTIL THEY HAD REALIZED THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS BY
THEM BUT AS AFTER THIS THERE WAS FEAR OF DETECTION THE USUAL CUSTOM
WAS TO GET RID OF THE ONLY WITNESS THAT COULD BE PRODUCED AGAINST THEM
WHICH WAS THE NEGRO HIMSELF BY MURDERING HIM AND THROWING HIS BODY
INTO THE MISSISSIPPI
EVEN IF IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THEY HAD STOLEN
A NEGRO BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED THEY WERE ALWAYS PREPARED TO EVADE
PUNISHMENT FOR THEY CONCEALED THE NEGRO WHO HAD RUN AWAY UNTIL HE
WAS ADVERTISED AND A REWARD OFFERED TO ANY MAN WHO WOULD CATCH HIM
AN
ADVERTISEMENT OF THIS KIND WARRANTS THE PERSON TO TAKE THE PROPERTY IF
FOUND
AND THEN THE NEGRO BECOMES A PROPERTY IN TRUST WHEN THEREFORE
THEY SOLD THE NEGRO IT ONLY BECAME A BREACH OF TRUST NOT STEALING AND
FOR A BREACH OF TRUST THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY CAN ONLY HAVE REDRESS
BY A CIVIL ACTION WHICH WAS USELESS AS THE DAMAGES WERE NEVER PAID
IT MAY BE INQUIRED HOW IT WAS THAT MUREL ESCAPED LYNCH LAW UNDER SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES THIS WILL BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD WHEN IT IS STATED THAT HE
HAD MORE THAN A THOUSAND SWORN CONFEDERATES ALL READY AT A MOMENT'S
NOTICE TO SUPPORT ANY OF THE GANG WHO MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE
THE NAMES OF
ALL THE PRINCIPAL CONFEDERATES OF MUREL WERE OBTAINED FROM HIMSELF IN
A MANNER WHICH I SHALL PRESENTLY EXPLAIN
THE GANG WAS COMPOSED OF TWO
CLASSES THE HEADS OR COUNCIL AS THEY WERE CALLED WHO PLANNED AND
CONCERTED BUT SELDOM ACTED THEY AMOUNTED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED
THE OTHER CLASS WERE THE ACTIVE AGENTS AND WERE TERMED STRIKERS AND
AMOUNTED TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY
THESE WERE THE TOOLS IN THE
HANDS OF THE OTHERS THEY RAN ALL THE RISK AND RECEIVED BUT A SMALL
PORTION OF THE MONEY THEY WERE IN THE POWER OF THE LEADERS OF THE GANG
WHO WOULD SACRIFICE THEM AT ANY TIME BY HANDING THEM OVER TO JUSTICE OR
SINKING THEIR BODIES IN THE MISSISSIPPI
THE GENERAL RENDEZVOUS OF THIS
GANG OF MISCREANTS WAS ON THE ARKANSAS SIDE OF THE RIVER WHERE THEY
CONCEALED THEIR NEGROES IN THE MORASSES AND CANE BRAKES
THE DEPREDATIONS OF THIS EXTENSIVE COMBINATION WERE SEVERELY FELT BUT
SO WELL WERE THEIR PLANS ARRANGED THAT ALTHOUGH MUREL WHO WAS ALWAYS
ACTIVE WAS EVERYWHERE SUSPECTED THERE WAS NO PROOF TO BE OBTAINED
IT
SO HAPPENED HOWEVER THAT A YOUNG MAN OF THE NAME OF STEWART WHO WAS
LOOKING AFTER TWO SLAVES WHICH MUREL HAD DECOYED AWAY FELL IN WITH HIM
AND OBTAINED HIS CONFIDENCE TOOK THE OATH AND WAS ADMITTED INTO THE
GANG AS ONE OF THE GENERAL COUNCIL
BY THIS MEANS ALL WAS DISCOVERED
FOR STEWART TURNED TRAITOR ALTHOUGH HE HAD TAKEN THE OATH AND HAVING
OBTAINED EVERY INFORMATION EXPOSED THE WHOLE CONCERN THE NAMES OF ALL
THE PARTIES AND FINALLY SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING HOME SUFFICIENT
EVIDENCE AGAINST MUREL TO PROCURE HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCE TO THE
PENITENTIARY MUREL WAS SENTENCED TO FOURTEEN YEARS' IMPRISONMENT SO
MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HONEST AND BORE A RESPECTABLE NAME
IN THE DIFFERENT STATES WERE FOUND TO BE AMONG THE LIST OF THE GRAND
COUNCIL AS PUBLISHED BY STEWART THAT EVERY ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO THROW
DISCREDIT UPON HIS ASSERTIONS HIS CHARACTER WAS VILIFIED AND MORE
THAN ONE ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO ASSASSINATE HIM
HE WAS OBLIGED TO QUIT THE
SOUTHERN STATES IN CONSEQUENCE
IT IS HOWEVER NOW WELL ASCERTAINED
TO HAVE BEEN ALL TRUE AND ALTHOUGH SOME BLAME MR
STEWART FOR HAVING
VIOLATED HIS OATH THEY NO LONGER ATTEMPT TO DENY THAT HIS REVELATIONS
WERE CORRECT
I WILL QUOTE ONE OR TWO PORTIONS OF MUREL'S CONFESSIONS TO
MR
STEWART MADE TO HIM WHEN THEY WERE JOURNEYING TOGETHER
I OUGHT TO
HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE ULTIMATE INTENTIONS OF MUREL AND HIS ASSOCIATES
WERE BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT ON A VERY EXTENDED SCALE HAVING NO LESS
AN OBJECT IN VIEW THAN RAISING THE BLACKS AGAINST THE WHITES TAKING
POSSESSION OF AND PLUNDERING NEW ORLEANS AND MAKING THEMSELVES
POSSESSORS OF THE TERRITORY
THE FOLLOWING ARE A FEW EXTRACTS
'I COLLECTED ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT NEW ORLEANS AT ONE OF OUR FRIENDS'
HOUSES IN THAT PLACE AND WE SAT IN COUNCIL THREE DAYS BEFORE WE GOT ALL
OUR PLANS TO OUR NOTION WE THEN DETERMINED TO UNDERTAKE THE REBELLION
AT EVERY HAZARD AND MAKE AS MANY FRIENDS AS WE COULD FOR THAT PURPOSE
EVERY MAN'S BUSINESS BEING ASSIGNED HIM I STARTED TO NATCHEZ ON FOOT
HAVING SOLD MY HORSE IN NEW ORLEANS WITH THE INTENTION OF STEALING
ANOTHER AFTER I STARTED
I WALKED FOUR DAYS AND NO OPPORTUNITY OFFERED
FOR ME TO GET A HORSE
THE FIFTH DAY ABOUT TWELVE I HAD BECOME TIRED
AND STOPPED AT A CREEK TO GET SOME WATER AND REST A LITTLE
WHILE I WAS
SITTING ON A LOG LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD THE WAY THAT I HAD COME A MAN
CAME IN SIGHT RIDING ON A GOOD LOOKING HORSE
THE VERY MOMENT I SAW HIM
I WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE HIS HORSE IF HE WAS IN THE GARB OF A TRAVELER
HE RODE UP AND I SAW FROM HIS EQUIPAGE THAT HE WAS A TRAVELER
I AROSE
AND DREW AN ELEGANT RIFLE PISTOL ON HIM AND ORDERED HIM TO DISMOUNT
HE
DID SO AND I TOOK HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND POINTED DOWN THE CREEK
AND ORDERED HIM TO WALK BEFORE ME
HE WENT A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AND
STOPPED
I HITCHED HIS HORSE AND THEN MADE HIM UNDRESS HIMSELF ALL TO
HIS SHIRT AND DRAWERS AND ORDERED HIM TO TURN HIS BACK TO ME
HE SAID
'IF YOU ARE DETERMINED TO KILL ME LET ME HAVE TIME TO PRAY BEFORE I
DIE I TOLD HIM I HAD NO TIME TO HEAR HIM PRAY
HE TURNED AROUND AND
DROPPED ON HIS KNEES AND I SHOT HIM THROUGH THE BACK OF THE HEAD
I RIPPED OPEN HIS BELLY AND TOOK OUT HIS ENTRAILS AND SUNK HIM IN THE
CREEK
I THEN SEARCHED HIS POCKETS AND FOUND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND
THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND A NUMBER OF PAPERS THAT I DID NOT TAKE TIME TO
EXAMINE
I SUNK THE POCKET BOOK AND PAPERS AND HIS HAT IN THE CREEK
HIS BOOTS WERE BRAND NEW AND FITTED ME GENTEELLY AND I PUT THEM ON
AND SUNK MY OLD SHOES IN THE CREEK TO ATONE FOR THEM
I ROLLED UP HIS
CLOTHES AND PUT THEM INTO HIS PORTMANTEAU AS THEY WERE BRAND NEW CLOTH
OF THE BEST QUALITY
I MOUNTED AS FINE A HORSE AS EVER I STRADDLED AND
DIRECTED MY COURSE FOR NATCHEZ IN MUCH BETTER STYLE THAN I HAD BEEN FOR
THE LAST FIVE DAYS
'MYSELF AND A FELLOW BY THE NAME OF CRENSHAW GATHERED FOUR GOOD HORSES
AND STARTED FOR GEORGIA
WE GOT IN COMPANY WITH A YOUNG SOUTH CAROLINIAN
JUST BEFORE WE GOT TO CUMBERLAND MOUNTAIN AND CRENSHAW SOON KNEW ALL
ABOUT HIS BUSINESS
HE HAD BEEN TO TENNESSEE TO BUY A DROVE OF HOGS BUT
WHEN HE GOT THERE PORK WAS DEARER THAN HE CALCULATED AND HE DECLINED
PURCHASING
WE CONCLUDED HE WAS A PRIZE
CRENSHAW WINKED AT ME I
UNDERSTOOD HIS IDEA
CRENSHAW HAD TRAVELED THE ROAD BEFORE BUT I NEVER
HAD WE HAD TRAVELED SEVERAL MILES ON THE MOUNTAIN WHEN HE PASSED NEAR
A GREAT PRECIPICE JUST BEFORE WE PASSED IT CRENSHAW ASKED ME FOR MY
WHIP WHICH HAD A POUND OF LEAD IN THE BUTT I HANDED IT TO HIM AND HE
RODE UP BY THE SIDE OF THE SOUTH CAROLINIAN AND GAVE HIM A BLOW ON THE
SIDE OF THE HEAD AND TUMBLED HIM FROM HIS HORSE WE LIT FROM OUR HORSES
AND FINGERED HIS POCKETS WE GOT TWELVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DOLLARS
CRENSHAW SAID HE KNEW A PLACE TO HIDE HIM AND HE GATHERED HIM UNDER HIS
ARMS AND I BY HIS FEET AND CONVEYED HIM TO A DEEP CREVICE IN THE BROW
OF THE PRECIPICE AND TUMBLED HIM INTO IT AND HE WENT OUT OF SIGHT WE
THEN TUMBLED IN HIS SADDLE AND TOOK HIS HORSE WITH US WHICH WAS WORTH
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
'WE WERE DETAINED A FEW DAYS AND DURING THAT TIME OUR FRIEND WENT TO A
LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SAW THE NEGRO ADVERTISED A NEGRO
IN OUR POSSESSION AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE TWO MEN OF WHOM HE HAD BEEN
PURCHASED AND GIVING HIS SUSPICIONS OF THE MEN
IT WAS RATHER SQUALLY
TIMES BUT ANY PORT IN A STORM WE TOOK THE NEGRO THAT NIGHT ON THE BANK
OF A CREEK WHICH RUNS BY THE FARM OF OUR FRIEND AND CRENSHAW SHOT HIM
THROUGH THE HEAD
WE TOOK OUT HIS ENTRAILS AND SUNK HIM IN THE CREEK
'HE HAD SOLD THE OTHER NEGRO THE THIRD TIME ON ARKANSAW RIVER FOR
UPWARDS OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THEN STOLE HIM AND DELIVERED HIM
INTO THE HAND OF HIS FRIEND WHO CONDUCTED HIM TO A SWAMP AND VEILED
THE TRAGIC SCENE AND GOT THE LAST GLEANINGS AND SACRED PLEDGE OF
SECRECY AS A GAME OF THAT KIND WILL NOT DO UNLESS IT ENDS IN A MYSTERY
TO ALL BUT THE FRATERNITY
HE SOLD THE NEGRO FIRST AND LAST FOR NEARLY
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN PUT HIM FOR EVER OUT OF THE REACH OF ALL
PURSUERS AND THEY CAN NEVER GRAZE HIM UNLESS THEY CAN FIND THE NEGRO
AND THAT THEY CANNOT DO FOR HIS CARCASS HAS FED MANY A TORTOISE AND
CATFISH BEFORE THIS TIME AND THE FROGS HAVE SUNG THIS MANY A LONG DAY
TO THE SILENT REPOSE OF HIS SKELETON
WE WERE APPROACHING MEMPHIS IN FRONT OF WHICH CITY AND WITNESSED BY
ITS PEOPLE WAS FOUGHT THE MOST FAMOUS OF THE RIVER BATTLES OF THE CIVIL
WAR
TWO MEN WHOM I HAD SERVED UNDER IN MY RIVER DAYS TOOK PART IN
THAT FIGHT MR
BIXBY HEAD PILOT OF THE UNION FLEET AND MONTGOMERY
COMMODORE OF THE CONFEDERATE FLEET
BOTH SAW A GREAT DEAL OF ACTIVE
SERVICE DURING THE WAR AND ACHIEVED HIGH REPUTATIONS FOR PLUCK AND
CAPACITY
AS WE NEARED MEMPHIS WE BEGAN TO CAST ABOUT FOR AN EXCUSE TO STAY
WITH THE 'GOLD DUST' TO THE END OF HER COURSE VICKSBURG
WE WERE SO
PLEASANTLY SITUATED THAT WE DID NOT WISH TO MAKE A CHANGE
I HAD AN
ERRAND OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE TO DO AT NAPOLEON ARKANSAS BUT
PERHAPS I COULD MANAGE IT WITHOUT QUITTING THE 'GOLD DUST I SAID AS
MUCH SO WE DECIDED TO STICK TO PRESENT QUARTERS
THE BOAT WAS TO TARRY AT MEMPHIS TILL TEN THE NEXT MORNING
IT IS A
BEAUTIFUL CITY NOBLY SITUATED ON A COMMANDING BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE
RIVER
THE STREETS ARE STRAIGHT AND SPACIOUS THOUGH NOT PAVED IN A WAY
TO INCITE DISTEMPERED ADMIRATION
NO THE ADMIRATION MUST BE RESERVED
FOR THE TOWN'S SEWERAGE SYSTEM WHICH IS CALLED PERFECT A RECENT
REFORM HOWEVER FOR IT WAS JUST THE OTHER WAY UP TO A FEW YEARS AGO A
REFORM RESULTING FROM THE LESSON TAUGHT BY A DESOLATING VISITATION
OF THE YELLOW FEVER
IN THOSE AWFUL DAYS THE PEOPLE WERE SWEPT OFF BY
HUNDREDS BY THOUSANDS AND SO GREAT WAS THE REDUCTION CAUSED BY FLIGHT
AND BY DEATH TOGETHER THAT THE POPULATION WAS DIMINISHED THREE FOURTHS
AND SO REMAINED FOR A TIME
BUSINESS STOOD NEARLY STILL AND THE STREETS
BORE AN EMPTY SUNDAY ASPECT
HERE IS A PICTURE OF MEMPHIS AT THAT DISASTROUS TIME DRAWN BY A GERMAN
TOURIST WHO SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN EYE WITNESS OF THE SCENES WHICH HE
DESCRIBES
IT IS FROM CHAPTER VII OF HIS BOOK JUST PUBLISHED IN
LEIPZIG 'MISSISSIPPI FAHRTEN VON ERNST VON HESSE WARTEGG
'IN AUGUST THE YELLOW FEVER HAD REACHED ITS EXTREMEST HEIGHT
DAILY
HUNDREDS FELL A SACRIFICE TO THE TERRIBLE EPIDEMIC
THE CITY WAS BECOME
A MIGHTY GRAVEYARD TWO THIRDS OF THE POPULATION HAD DESERTED THE PLACE
AND ONLY THE POOR THE AGED AND THE SICK REMAINED BEHIND A SURE PREY
FOR THE INSIDIOUS ENEMY
THE HOUSES WERE CLOSED LITTLE LAMPS BURNED IN
FRONT OF MANY A SIGN THAT HERE DEATH HAD ENTERED
OFTEN SEVERAL LAY
DEAD IN A SINGLE HOUSE FROM THE WINDOWS HUNG BLACK CRAPE
THE STORES
WERE SHUT UP FOR THEIR OWNERS WERE GONE AWAY OR DEAD
'FEARFUL EVIL IN THE BRIEFEST SPACE IT STRUCK DOWN AND SWEPT AWAY EVEN
THE MOST VIGOROUS VICTIM
A SLIGHT INDISPOSITION THEN AN HOUR OF
FEVER THEN THE HIDEOUS DELIRIUM THEN THE YELLOW DEATH ON THE STREET
CORNERS AND IN THE SQUARES LAY SICK MEN SUDDENLY OVERTAKEN BY THE
DISEASE AND EVEN CORPSES DISTORTED AND RIGID
FOOD FAILED
MEAT
SPOILED IN A FEW HOURS IN THE FETID AND PESTIFEROUS AIR AND TURNED
BLACK
'FEARFUL CLAMORS ISSUE FROM MANY HOUSES THEN AFTER A SEASON THEY CEASE
AND ALL IS STILL NOBLE SELF SACRIFICING MEN COME WITH THE COFFIN
NAIL IT UP AND CARRY IT AWAY TO THE GRAVEYARD
IN THE NIGHT STILLNESS
REIGNS
ONLY THE PHYSICIANS AND THE HEARSES HURRY THROUGH THE STREETS
AND OUT OF THE DISTANCE AT INTERVALS COMES THE MUFFLED THUNDER OF THE
RAILWAY TRAIN WHICH WITH THE SPEED OF THE WIND AND AS IF HUNTED BY
FURIES FLIES BY THE PEST RIDDEN CITY WITHOUT HALTING
BUT THERE IS LIFE ENOUGH THERE NOW
THE POPULATION EXCEEDS FORTY
THOUSAND AND IS AUGMENTING AND TRADE IS IN A FLOURISHING CONDITION
WE DROVE ABOUT THE CITY VISITED THE PARK AND THE SOCIABLE HORDE OF
SQUIRRELS THERE SAW THE FINE RESIDENCES ROSE CLAD AND IN OTHER WAYS
ENTICING TO THE EYE AND GOT A GOOD BREAKFAST AT THE HOTEL
A THRIVING PLACE IS THE GOOD SAMARITAN CITY OF THE MISSISSIPPI HAS
A GREAT WHOLESALE JOBBING TRADE FOUNDRIES MACHINE SHOPS AND
MANUFACTORIES OF WAGONS CARRIAGES AND COTTON SEED OIL AND IS SHORTLY
TO HAVE COTTON MILLS AND ELEVATORS
HER COTTON RECEIPTS REACHED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BALES LAST YEAR AN
INCREASE OF SIXTY THOUSAND OVER THE YEAR BEFORE
OUT FROM HER HEALTHY
COMMERCIAL HEART ISSUE FIVE TRUNK LINES OF RAILWAY AND A SIXTH IS BEING
ADDED
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT MEMPHIS FROM THE ONE WHICH THE VANISHED AND
UNREMEMBERED PROCESSION OF FOREIGN TOURISTS USED TO PUT INTO THEIR BOOKS
LONG TIME AGO
IN THE DAYS OF THE NOW FORGOTTEN BUT ONCE RENOWNED AND
VIGOROUSLY HATED MRS
TROLLOPE MEMPHIS SEEMS TO HAVE CONSISTED MAINLY
OF ONE LONG STREET OF LOG HOUSES WITH SOME OUTLYING CABINS SPRINKLED
AROUND REARWARD TOWARD THE WOODS AND NOW AND THEN A PIG AND NO END OF
MUD
THAT WAS FIFTY FIVE YEARS AGO
SHE STOPPED AT THE HOTEL
PLAINLY IT
WAS NOT THE ONE WHICH GAVE US OUR BREAKFAST
SHE SAYS
'THE TABLE WAS LAID FOR FIFTY PERSONS AND WAS NEARLY FULL
THEY ATE IN
PERFECT SILENCE AND WITH SUCH ASTONISHING RAPIDITY THAT THEIR DINNER
WAS OVER LITERALLY BEFORE OURS WAS BEGUN THE ONLY SOUNDS HEARD WERE
THOSE PRODUCED BY THE KNIVES AND FORKS WITH THE UNCEASING CHORUS OF
COUGHING ETC
'COUGHING ETC THE 'ETC STANDS FOR AN UNPLEASANT WORD THERE A WORD
WHICH SHE DOES NOT ALWAYS CHARITABLY COVER UP BUT SOMETIMES PRINTS
YOU
WILL FIND IT IN THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF A STEAMBOAT DINNER WHICH
SHE ATE IN COMPANY WITH A LOT OF ARISTOCRATIC PLANTERS WEALTHY
WELL BORN IGNORANT SWELLS THEY WERE TINSELLED WITH THE USUAL HARMLESS
MILITARY AND JUDICIAL TITLES OF THAT OLD DAY OF CHEAP SHAMS AND WINDY
PRETENSE
'THE TOTAL WANT OF ALL THE USUAL COURTESIES OF THE TABLE THE VORACIOUS
RAPIDITY WITH WHICH THE VIANDS WERE SEIZED AND DEVOURED THE STRANGE
UNCOUTH PHRASES AND PRONUNCIATION THE LOATHSOME SPITTING FROM THE
CONTAMINATION OF WHICH IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROTECT OUR
DRESSES THE FRIGHTFUL MANNER OF FEEDING WITH THEIR KNIVES TILL THE
WHOLE BLADE SEEMED TO ENTER INTO THE MOUTH AND THE STILL MORE FRIGHTFUL
MANNER OF CLEANING THE TEETH AFTERWARD WITH A POCKET KNIFE SOON FORCED
US TO FEEL THAT WE WERE NOT SURROUNDED BY THE GENERALS COLONELS AND
MAJORS OF THE OLD WORLD AND THAT THE DINNER HOUR WAS TO BE ANYTHING
RATHER THAN AN HOUR OF ENJOYMENT
CHAPTER 30
SKETCHES BY THE WAY
IT WAS A BIG RIVER BELOW MEMPHIS BANKS BRIMMING FULL EVERYWHERE AND
VERY FREQUENTLY MORE THAN FULL THE WATERS POURING OUT OVER THE LAND
FLOODING THE WOODS AND FIELDS FOR MILES INTO THE INTERIOR AND IN
PLACES TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN FEET SIGNS ALL ABOUT OF MEN'S HARD WORK
GONE TO RUIN AND ALL TO BE DONE OVER AGAIN WITH STRAITENED MEANS AND A
WEAKENED COURAGE
A MELANCHOLY PICTURE AND A CONTINUOUS ONE HUNDREDS
OF MILES OF IT
SOMETIMES THE BEACON LIGHTS STOOD IN WATER THREE FEET
DEEP IN THE EDGE OF DENSE FORESTS WHICH EXTENDED FOR MILES WITHOUT
FARM WOOD YARD CLEARING OR BREAK OF ANY KIND WHICH MEANT THAT THE
KEEPER OF THE LIGHT MUST COME IN A SKIFF A GREAT DISTANCE TO DISCHARGE
HIS TRUST AND OFTEN IN DESPERATE WEATHER
YET I WAS TOLD THAT THE
WORK IS FAITHFULLY PERFORMED IN ALL WEATHERS AND NOT ALWAYS BY
MEN SOMETIMES BY WOMEN IF THE MAN IS SICK OR ABSENT
THE GOVERNMENT
FURNISHES OIL AND PAYS TEN OR FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THE LIGHTING
AND TENDING
A GOVERNMENT BOAT DISTRIBUTES OIL AND PAYS WAGES ONCE A
MONTH
THE SHIP ISLAND REGION WAS AS WOODSY AND TENANTLESS AS EVER
THE ISLAND
HAS CEASED TO BE AN ISLAND HAS JOINED ITSELF COMPACTLY TO THE MAIN
SHORE AND WAGONS TRAVEL NOW WHERE THE STEAMBOATS USED TO NAVIGATE
NO
SIGNS LEFT OF THE WRECK OF THE 'PENNSYLVANIA SOME FARMER WILL TURN UP
HER BONES WITH HIS PLOW ONE DAY NO DOUBT AND BE SURPRISED
WE WERE GETTING DOWN NOW INTO THE MIGRATING NEGRO REGION
THESE POOR
PEOPLE COULD NEVER TRAVEL WHEN THEY WERE SLAVES SO THEY MAKE UP FOR
THE PRIVATION NOW
THEY STAY ON A PLANTATION TILL THE DESIRE TO TRAVEL
SEIZES THEM THEN THEY PACK UP HAIL A STEAMBOAT AND CLEAR OUT
NOT FOR
ANY PARTICULAR PLACE NO NEARLY ANY PLACE WILL ANSWER THEY ONLY WANT
TO BE MOVING
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON HAND WILL ANSWER THE REST OF THE
CONUNDRUM FOR THEM
IF IT WILL TAKE THEM FIFTY MILES VERY WELL LET IT
BE FIFTY
IF NOT A SHORTER FLIGHT WILL DO
DURING A COUPLE OF DAYS WE FREQUENTLY ANSWERED THESE HAILS
SOMETIMES
THERE WAS A GROUP OF HIGH WATER STAINED TUMBLE DOWN CABINS POPULOUS
WITH COLORED FOLK AND NO WHITES VISIBLE WITH GRASSLESS PATCHES OF DRY
GROUND HERE AND THERE A FEW FELLED TREES WITH SKELETON CATTLE MULES
AND HORSES EATING THE LEAVES AND GNAWING THE BARK NO OTHER FOOD FOR
THEM IN THE FLOOD WASTED LAND
SOMETIMES THERE WAS A SINGLE LONELY
LANDING CABIN NEAR IT THE COLORED FAMILY THAT HAD HAILED US LITTLE AND
BIG OLD AND YOUNG ROOSTING ON THE SCANT PILE OF HOUSEHOLD GOODS THESE
CONSISTING OF A RUSTY GUN SOME BED TICKS CHESTS TINWARE STOOLS
A CRIPPLED LOOKING GLASS A VENERABLE ARM CHAIR AND SIX OR EIGHT
BASE BORN AND SPIRITLESS YELLOW CURS ATTACHED TO THE FAMILY BY STRINGS
THEY MUST HAVE THEIR DOGS CAN'T GO WITHOUT THEIR DOGS
YET THE DOGS ARE
NEVER WILLING THEY ALWAYS OBJECT SO ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN RIDICULOUS
PROCESSION THEY ARE DRAGGED ABOARD ALL FOUR FEET BRACED AND SLIDING
ALONG THE STAGE HEAD LIKELY TO BE PULLED OFF BUT THE TUGGER MARCHING
DETERMINEDLY FORWARD BENDING TO HIS WORK WITH THE ROPE OVER HIS
SHOULDER FOR BETTER PURCHASE
SOMETIMES A CHILD IS FORGOTTEN AND LEFT ON
THE BANK BUT NEVER A DOG
THE USUAL RIVER GOSSIP GOING ON IN THE PILOT HOUSE
ISLAND NO
63 AN
ISLAND WITH A LOVELY 'CHUTE OR PASSAGE BEHIND IT IN THE FORMER TIMES
THEY SAID JESSE JAMIESON IN THE 'SKYLARK HAD A VISITING PILOT WITH
HIM ONE TRIP A POOR OLD BROKEN DOWN SUPERANNUATED FELLOW LEFT HIM AT
THE WHEEL AT THE FOOT OF 63 TO RUN OFF THE WATCH
THE ANCIENT MARINER
WENT UP THROUGH THE CHUTE AND DOWN THE RIVER OUTSIDE AND UP THE CHUTE
AND DOWN THE RIVER AGAIN AND YET AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HANDED THE
BOAT OVER TO THE RELIEVING PILOT AT THE END OF THREE HOURS OF HONEST
ENDEAVOR AT THE SAME OLD FOOT OF THE ISLAND WHERE HE HAD ORIGINALLY
TAKEN THE WHEEL A DARKEY ON SHORE WHO HAD OBSERVED THE BOAT GO BY
ABOUT THIRTEEN TIMES SAID 'CLAR TO GRACIOUS I WOULDN'T BE S'PRISED IF
DEY'S A WHOLE LINE O' DEM SK'YLARKS
ANECDOTE ILLUSTRATIVE OF INFLUENCE OF REPUTATION IN THE CHANGING OF
OPINION
THE 'ECLIPSE' WAS RENOWNED FOR HER SWIFTNESS
ONE DAY SHE
PASSED ALONG AN OLD DARKEY ON SHORE ABSORBED IN HIS OWN MATTERS DID
NOT NOTICE WHAT STEAMER IT WAS
PRESENTLY SOMEONE ASKED
'ANY BOAT GONE UP
'YES SAH
'WAS SHE GOING FAST
'OH SO SO LOAFIN' ALONG
'NOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT BOAT THAT WAS
'NO SAH
'WHY UNCLE THAT WAS THE ECLIPSE
'NO IS DAT SO WELL I BET IT WAS CAUSE SHE JES' WENT BY HERE
A SPARKLIN '
PIECE OF HISTORY ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE VIOLENT STYLE OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE
DOWN ALONG HERE DURING THE EARLY WEEKS OF HIGH WATER A'S FENCE RAILS
WASHED DOWN ON B'S GROUND AND B'S RAILS WASHED UP IN THE EDDY AND
LANDED ON A'S GROUND
A SAID 'LET THE THING REMAIN SO I WILL USE YOUR
RAILS AND YOU USE MINE BUT B OBJECTED WOULDN'T HAVE IT SO
ONE DAY
A CAME DOWN ON B'S GROUND TO GET HIS RAILS
B SAID 'I'LL KILL YOU AND
PROCEEDED FOR HIM WITH HIS REVOLVER
A SAID 'I'M NOT ARMED SO B WHO
WISHED TO DO ONLY WHAT WAS RIGHT THREW DOWN HIS REVOLVER THEN PULLED
A KNIFE AND CUT A'S THROAT ALL AROUND BUT GAVE HIS PRINCIPAL ATTENTION
TO THE FRONT AND SO FAILED TO SEVER THE JUGULAR
STRUGGLING AROUND A
MANAGED TO GET HIS HANDS ON THE DISCARDED REVOLVER AND SHOT B DEAD WITH
IT AND RECOVERED FROM HIS OWN INJURIES
FURTHER GOSSIP AFTER WHICH EVERYBODY WENT BELOW TO GET AFTERNOON
COFFEE AND LEFT ME AT THE WHEEL ALONE SOMETHING PRESENTLY REMINDED
ME OF OUR LAST HOUR IN ST
LOUIS PART OF WHICH I SPENT ON THIS BOAT'S
HURRICANE DECK AFT
I WAS JOINED THERE BY A STRANGER WHO DROPPED INTO
CONVERSATION WITH ME A BRISK YOUNG FELLOW WHO SAID HE WAS BORN IN A
TOWN IN THE INTERIOR OF WISCONSIN AND HAD NEVER SEEN A STEAMBOAT UNTIL
A WEEK BEFORE
ALSO SAID THAT ON THE WAY DOWN FROM LA CROSSE HE HAD
INSPECTED AND EXAMINED HIS BOAT SO DILIGENTLY AND WITH SUCH PASSIONATE
INTEREST THAT HE HAD MASTERED THE WHOLE THING FROM STEM TO RUDDER BLADE
ASKED ME WHERE I WAS FROM
I ANSWERED NEW ENGLAND
'OH A YANK SAID
HE AND WENT CHATTING STRAIGHT ALONG WITHOUT WAITING FOR ASSENT OR
DENIAL
HE IMMEDIATELY PROPOSED TO TAKE ME ALL OVER THE BOAT AND TELL
ME THE NAMES OF HER DIFFERENT PARTS AND TEACH ME THEIR USES
BEFORE I
COULD ENTER PROTEST OR EXCUSE HE WAS ALREADY RATTLING GLIBLY AWAY AT
HIS BENEVOLENT WORK AND WHEN I PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS MISNAMING THE
THINGS AND INHOSPITABLY AMUSING HIMSELF AT THE EXPENSE OF AN INNOCENT
STRANGER FROM A FAR COUNTRY I HELD MY PEACE AND LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY
HE GAVE ME A WORLD OF MISINFORMATION AND THE FURTHER HE WENT THE WIDER
HIS IMAGINATION EXPANDED AND THE MORE HE ENJOYED HIS CRUEL WORK OF
DECEIT
SOMETIMES AFTER PALMING OFF A PARTICULARLY FANTASTIC AND
OUTRAGEOUS LIE UPON ME HE WAS SO 'FULL OF LAUGH' THAT HE HAD TO
STEP ASIDE FOR A MINUTE UPON ONE PRETEXT OR ANOTHER TO KEEP ME FROM
SUSPECTING
I STAID FAITHFULLY BY HIM UNTIL HIS COMEDY WAS FINISHED
THEN HE REMARKED THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN TO 'LEARN' ME ALL ABOUT A
STEAMBOAT AND HAD DONE IT BUT THAT IF HE HAD OVERLOOKED ANYTHING JUST
ASK HIM AND HE WOULD SUPPLY THE LACK
'ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOAT THAT YOU
DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF OR THE PURPOSE OF YOU COME TO ME AND I'LL TELL
YOU I SAID I WOULD AND TOOK MY DEPARTURE DISAPPEARED AND APPROACHED
HIM FROM ANOTHER QUARTER WHENCE HE COULD NOT SEE ME
THERE HE SAT ALL
ALONE DOUBLING HIMSELF UP AND WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT IN THE THROES
OF UNAPPEASABLE LAUGHTER
HE MUST HAVE MADE HIMSELF SICK FOR HE WAS
NOT PUBLICLY VISIBLE AFTERWARD FOR SEVERAL DAYS
MEANTIME THE EPISODE
DROPPED OUT OF MY MIND
THE THING THAT REMINDED ME OF IT NOW WHEN I WAS ALONE AT THE WHEEL
WAS THE SPECTACLE OF THIS YOUNG FELLOW STANDING IN THE PILOT HOUSE DOOR
WITH THE KNOB IN HIS HAND SILENTLY AND SEVERELY INSPECTING ME
I DON'T
KNOW WHEN I HAVE SEEN ANYBODY LOOK SO INJURED AS HE DID
HE DID NOT
SAY ANYTHING SIMPLY STOOD THERE AND LOOKED REPROACHFULLY LOOKED AND
PONDERED
FINALLY HE SHUT THE DOOR AND STARTED AWAY HALTED ON THE
TEXAS A MINUTE CAME SLOWLY BACK AND STOOD IN THE DOOR AGAIN WITH THAT
GRIEVED LOOK IN HIS FACE GAZED UPON ME AWHILE IN MEEK REBUKE THEN
SAID
'YOU LET ME LEARN YOU ALL ABOUT A STEAMBOAT DIDN'T YOU
'YES I CONFESSED
'YES YOU DID DIDN'T YOU
'YES
'YOU ARE THE FELLER THAT THAT
LANGUAGE FAILED
PAUSE IMPOTENT STRUGGLE FOR FURTHER WORDS THEN HE
GAVE IT UP CHOKED OUT A DEEP STRONG OATH AND DEPARTED FOR GOOD
AFTERWARD I SAW HIM SEVERAL TIMES BELOW DURING THE TRIP BUT HE WAS
COLD WOULD NOT LOOK AT ME
IDIOT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN IN SUCH A SWEAT TO
PLAY HIS WITLESS PRACTICAL JOKE UPON ME IN THE BEGINNING I WOULD HAVE
PERSUADED HIS THOUGHTS INTO SOME OTHER DIRECTION AND SAVED HIM FROM
COMMITTING THAT WANTON AND SILLY IMPOLITENESS
I HAD MYSELF CALLED WITH THE FOUR O'CLOCK WATCH MORNINGS FOR ONE
CANNOT SEE TOO MANY SUMMER SUNRISES ON THE MISSISSIPPI
THEY ARE
ENCHANTING
FIRST THERE IS THE ELOQUENCE OF SILENCE FOR A DEEP HUSH
BROODS EVERYWHERE
NEXT THERE IS THE HAUNTING SENSE OF LONELINESS
ISOLATION REMOTENESS FROM THE WORRY AND BUSTLE OF THE WORLD
THE DAWN
CREEPS IN STEALTHILY THE SOLID WALLS OF BLACK FOREST SOFTEN TO GRAY
AND VAST STRETCHES OF THE RIVER OPEN UP AND REVEAL THEMSELVES THE WATER
IS GLASS SMOOTH GIVES OFF SPECTRAL LITTLE WREATHS OF WHITE MIST THERE
IS NOT THE FAINTEST BREATH OF WIND NOR STIR OF LEAF THE TRANQUILLITY
IS PROFOUND AND INFINITELY SATISFYING
THEN A BIRD PIPES UP ANOTHER
FOLLOWS AND SOON THE PIPINGS DEVELOP INTO A JUBILANT RIOT OF MUSIC
YOU SEE NONE OF THE BIRDS YOU SIMPLY MOVE THROUGH AN ATMOSPHERE OF SONG
WHICH SEEMS TO SING ITSELF
WHEN THE LIGHT HAS BECOME A LITTLE STRONGER
YOU HAVE ONE OF THE FAIREST AND SOFTEST PICTURES IMAGINABLE
YOU HAVE
THE INTENSE GREEN OF THE MASSED AND CROWDED FOLIAGE NEAR BY YOU SEE IT
PALING SHADE BY SHADE IN FRONT OF YOU UPON THE NEXT PROJECTING CAPE
A MILE OFF OR MORE THE TINT HAS LIGHTENED TO THE TENDER YOUNG GREEN OF
SPRING THE CAPE BEYOND THAT ONE HAS ALMOST LOST COLOR AND THE FURTHEST
ONE MILES AWAY UNDER THE HORIZON SLEEPS UPON THE WATER A MERE DIM
VAPOR AND HARDLY SEPARABLE FROM THE SKY ABOVE IT AND ABOUT IT
AND ALL
THIS STRETCH OF RIVER IS A MIRROR AND YOU HAVE THE SHADOWY REFLECTIONS
OF THE LEAFAGE AND THE CURVING SHORES AND THE RECEDING CAPES PICTURED IN
IT
WELL THAT IS ALL BEAUTIFUL SOFT AND RICH AND BEAUTIFUL AND WHEN
THE SUN GETS WELL UP AND DISTRIBUTES A PINK FLUSH HERE AND A POWDER OF
GOLD YONDER AND A PURPLE HAZE WHERE IT WILL YIELD THE BEST EFFECT YOU
GRANT THAT YOU HAVE SEEN SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH REMEMBERING
WE HAD THE KENTUCKY BEND COUNTRY IN THE EARLY MORNING SCENE OF A
STRANGE AND TRAGIC ACCIDENT IN THE OLD TIMES CAPTAIN POE HAD A SMALL
STERN WHEEL BOAT FOR YEARS THE HOME OF HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE
ONE NIGHT
THE BOAT STRUCK A SNAG IN THE HEAD OF KENTUCKY BEND AND SANK WITH
ASTONISHING SUDDENNESS WATER ALREADY WELL ABOVE THE CABIN FLOOR WHEN
THE CAPTAIN GOT AFT
SO HE CUT INTO HIS WIFE'S STATE ROOM FROM ABOVE
WITH AN AX SHE WAS ASLEEP IN THE UPPER BERTH THE ROOF A FLIMSIER ONE
THAN WAS SUPPOSED THE FIRST BLOW CRASHED DOWN THROUGH THE ROTTEN BOARDS
AND CLOVE HER SKULL
THIS BEND IS ALL FILLED UP NOW RESULT OF A CUT OFF AND THE SAME AGENT
HAS TAKEN THE GREAT AND ONCE MUCH FREQUENTED WALNUT BEND AND SET
IT AWAY BACK IN A SOLITUDE FAR FROM THE ACCUSTOMED TRACK OF PASSING
STEAMERS
HELENA WE VISITED AND ALSO A TOWN I HAD NOT HEARD OF BEFORE IT BEING
OF RECENT BIRTH ARKANSAS CITY
IT WAS BORN OF A RAILWAY THE LITTLE
ROCK MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TEXAS RAILROAD TOUCHES THE RIVER THERE
WE ASKED A PASSENGER WHO BELONGED THERE WHAT SORT OF A PLACE IT WAS
'WELL SAID HE AFTER CONSIDERING AND WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WISHES
TO TAKE TIME AND BE ACCURATE 'IT'S A HELL OF A PLACE A DESCRIPTION
WHICH WAS PHOTOGRAPHIC FOR EXACTNESS
THERE WERE SEVERAL ROWS AND
CLUSTERS OF SHABBY FRAME HOUSES AND A SUPPLY OF MUD SUFFICIENT TO
INSURE THE TOWN AGAINST A FAMINE IN THAT ARTICLE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
FOR THE OVERFLOW HAD BUT LATELY SUBSIDED
THERE WERE STAGNANT PONDS
IN THE STREETS HERE AND THERE AND A DOZEN RUDE SCOWS WERE SCATTERED
ABOUT LYING AGROUND WHEREVER THEY HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN WHEN THE WATERS
DRAINED OFF AND PEOPLE COULD DO THEIR VISITING AND SHOPPING ON FOOT ONCE
MORE
STILL IT IS A THRIVING PLACE WITH A RICH COUNTRY BEHIND IT AN
ELEVATOR IN FRONT OF IT AND ALSO A FINE BIG MILL FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF
COTTON SEED OIL
I HAD NEVER SEEN THIS KIND OF A MILL BEFORE
COTTON SEED WAS COMPARATIVELY VALUELESS IN MY TIME BUT IT IS WORTH 12
OR 13 A TON NOW AND NONE OF IT IS THROWN AWAY
THE OIL MADE FROM IT IS
COLORLESS TASTELESS AND ALMOST IF NOT ENTIRELY ODORLESS
IT IS CLAIMED
THAT IT CAN BY PROPER MANIPULATION BE MADE TO RESEMBLE AND PERFORM THE
OFFICE OF ANY AND ALL OILS AND BE PRODUCED AT A CHEAPER RATE THAN
THE CHEAPEST OF THE ORIGINALS
SAGACIOUS PEOPLE SHIPPED IT TO ITALY
DOCTORED IT LABELED IT AND BROUGHT IT BACK AS OLIVE OIL
THIS TRADE
GREW TO BE SO FORMIDABLE THAT ITALY WAS OBLIGED TO PUT A PROHIBITORY
IMPOST UPON IT TO KEEP IT FROM WORKING SERIOUS INJURY TO HER OIL
INDUSTRY
HELENA OCCUPIES ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SITUATIONS ON THE MISSISSIPPI
HER
PERCH IS THE LAST THE SOUTHERNMOST GROUP OF HILLS WHICH ONE SEES ON
THAT SIDE OF THE RIVER
IN ITS NORMAL CONDITION IT IS A PRETTY TOWN BUT
THE FLOOD OR POSSIBLY THE SEEPAGE HAD LATELY BEEN RAVAGING IT WHOLE
STREETS OF HOUSES HAD BEEN INVADED BY THE MUDDY WATER AND THE OUTSIDES
OF THE BUILDINGS WERE STILL BELTED WITH A BROAD STAIN EXTENDING UPWARDS
FROM THE FOUNDATIONS
STRANDED AND DISCARDED SCOWS LAY ALL ABOUT
PLANK SIDEWALKS ON STILTS FOUR FEET HIGH WERE STILL STANDING THE BOARD
SIDEWALKS ON THE GROUND LEVEL WERE LOOSE AND RUINOUS A COUPLE OF MEN
TROTTING ALONG THEM COULD MAKE A BLIND MAN THINK A CAVALRY CHARGE
WAS COMING EVERYWHERE THE MUD WAS BLACK AND DEEP AND IN MANY
PLACES MALARIOUS POOLS OF STAGNANT WATER WERE STANDING
A MISSISSIPPI
INUNDATION IS THE NEXT MOST WASTING AND DESOLATING INFLICTION TO A FIRE
WE HAD AN ENJOYABLE TIME HERE ON THIS SUNNY SUNDAY TWO FULL HOURS'
LIBERTY ASHORE WHILE THE BOAT DISCHARGED FREIGHT
IN THE BACK STREETS
BUT FEW WHITE PEOPLE WERE VISIBLE BUT THERE WERE PLENTY OF COLORED
FOLK MAINLY WOMEN AND GIRLS AND ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION UPHOLSTERED
IN BRIGHT NEW CLOTHES OF SWELL AND ELABORATE STYLE AND CUT A GLARING
AND HILARIOUS CONTRAST TO THE MOURNFUL MUD AND THE PENSIVE PUDDLES
HELENA IS THE SECOND TOWN IN ARKANSAS IN POINT OF POPULATION WHICH
IS PLACED AT FIVE THOUSAND
THE COUNTRY ABOUT IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY
PRODUCTIVE
HELENA HAS A GOOD COTTON TRADE HANDLES FROM FORTY TO SIXTY
THOUSAND BALES ANNUALLY SHE HAS A LARGE LUMBER AND GRAIN COMMERCE HAS
A FOUNDRY OIL MILLS MACHINE SHOPS AND WAGON FACTORIES IN BRIEF HAS
1 000 000 INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
SHE HAS TWO RAILWAYS
AND IS THE COMMERCIAL CENTER OF A BROAD AND PROSPEROUS REGION
HER GROSS
RECEIPTS OF MONEY ANNUALLY FROM ALL SOURCES ARE PLACED BY THE NEW
ORLEANS 'TIMES DEMOCRAT' AT 4 000 000
CHAPTER 31
A THUMB PRINT AND WHAT CAME OF IT
WE WERE APPROACHING NAPOLEON ARKANSAS
SO I BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT MY
ERRAND THERE
TIME NOONDAY AND BRIGHT AND SUNNY
THIS WAS BAD NOT
BEST ANYWAY FOR MINE WAS NOT PREFERABLY A NOONDAY KIND OF ERRAND
THE MORE I THOUGHT THE MORE THAT FACT PUSHED ITSELF UPON ME NOW IN ONE
FORM NOW IN ANOTHER
FINALLY IT TOOK THE FORM OF A DISTINCT QUESTION
IS IT GOOD COMMON SENSE TO DO THE ERRAND IN DAYTIME WHEN BY A LITTLE
SACRIFICE OF COMFORT AND INCLINATION YOU CAN HAVE NIGHT FOR IT AND
NO INQUISITIVE EYES AROUND
THIS SETTLED IT
PLAIN QUESTION AND PLAIN
ANSWER MAKE THE SHORTEST ROAD OUT OF MOST PERPLEXITIES
I GOT MY FRIENDS INTO MY STATEROOM AND SAID I WAS SORRY TO CREATE
ANNOYANCE AND DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THAT UPON REFLECTION IT REALLY SEEMED
BEST THAT WE PUT OUR LUGGAGE ASHORE AND STOP OVER AT NAPOLEON
THEIR
DISAPPROVAL WAS PROMPT AND LOUD THEIR LANGUAGE MUTINOUS
THEIR MAIN
ARGUMENT WAS ONE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FIRST TO COME TO THE SURFACE
IN SUCH CASES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME 'BUT YOU DECIDED AND AGREED
TO STICK TO THIS BOAT ETC AS IF HAVING DETERMINED TO DO AN UNWISE
THING ONE IS THEREBY BOUND TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE TWO UNWISE THINGS OF
IT BY CARRYING OUT THAT DETERMINATION
I TRIED VARIOUS MOLLIFYING TACTICS UPON THEM WITH REASONABLY GOOD
SUCCESS UNDER WHICH ENCOURAGEMENT I INCREASED MY EFFORTS AND TO SHOW
THEM THAT I HAD NOT CREATED THIS ANNOYING ERRAND AND WAS IN NO WAY TO
BLAME FOR IT I PRESENTLY DRIFTED INTO ITS HISTORY SUBSTANTIALLY AS
FOLLOWS
TOWARD THE END OF LAST YEAR I SPENT A FEW MONTHS IN MUNICH BAVARIA
IN NOVEMBER I WAS LIVING IN FRAULEIN DAHLWEINER'S PENSION 1A
KARLSTRASSE BUT MY WORKING QUARTERS WERE A MILE FROM THERE IN THE
HOUSE OF A WIDOW WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF BY TAKING LODGERS
SHE AND HER
TWO YOUNG CHILDREN USED TO DROP IN EVERY MORNING AND TALK GERMAN TO
ME BY REQUEST
ONE DAY DURING A RAMBLE ABOUT THE CITY I VISITED ONE
OF THE TWO ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT KEEPS AND WATCHES CORPSES
UNTIL THE DOCTORS DECIDE THAT THEY ARE PERMANENTLY DEAD AND NOT IN
A TRANCE STATE
IT WAS A GRISLY PLACE THAT SPACIOUS ROOM
THERE WERE
THIRTY SIX CORPSES OF ADULTS IN SIGHT STRETCHED ON THEIR BACKS ON
SLIGHTLY SLANTED BOARDS IN THREE LONG ROWS ALL OF THEM WITH WAX WHITE
RIGID FACES AND ALL OF THEM WRAPPED IN WHITE SHROUDS
ALONG THE SIDES
OF THE ROOM WERE DEEP ALCOVES LIKE BAY WINDOWS AND IN EACH OF THESE
LAY SEVERAL MARBLE VISAGED BABES UTTERLY HIDDEN AND BURIED UNDER BANKS
OF FRESH FLOWERS ALL BUT THEIR FACES AND CROSSED HANDS
AROUND A FINGER
OF EACH OF THESE FIFTY STILL FORMS BOTH GREAT AND SMALL WAS A RING
AND FROM THE RING A WIRE LED TO THE CEILING AND THENCE TO A BELL IN A
WATCH ROOM YONDER WHERE DAY AND NIGHT A WATCHMAN SITS ALWAYS ALERT
AND READY TO SPRING TO THE AID OF ANY OF THAT PALLID COMPANY WHO
WAKING OUT OF DEATH SHALL MAKE A MOVEMENT FOR ANY EVEN THE SLIGHTEST
MOVEMENT WILL TWITCH THE WIRE AND RING THAT FEARFUL BELL
I IMAGINED
MYSELF A DEATH SENTINEL DROWSING THERE ALONE FAR IN THE DRAGGING
WATCHES OF SOME WAILING GUSTY NIGHT AND HAVING IN A TWINKLING ALL
MY BODY STRICKEN TO QUIVERING JELLY BY THE SUDDEN CLAMOR OF THAT AWFUL
SUMMONS SO I INQUIRED ABOUT THIS THING ASKED WHAT RESULTED USUALLY IF
THE WATCHMAN DIED AND THE RESTORED CORPSE CAME AND DID WHAT IT COULD TO
MAKE HIS LAST MOMENTS EASY
BUT I WAS REBUKED FOR TRYING TO FEED AN IDLE
AND FRIVOLOUS CURIOSITY IN SO SOLEMN AND SO MOURNFUL A PLACE AND WENT
MY WAY WITH A HUMBLED CREST
NEXT MORNING I WAS TELLING THE WIDOW MY ADVENTURE WHEN SHE EXCLAIMED
'COME WITH ME I HAVE A LODGER WHO SHALL TELL YOU ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW
HE HAS BEEN A NIGHT WATCHMAN THERE
HE WAS A LIVING MAN BUT HE DID NOT LOOK IT
HE WAS ABED AND HAD HIS
HEAD PROPPED HIGH ON PILLOWS HIS FACE WAS WASTED AND COLORLESS
HIS DEEP SUNKEN EYES WERE SHUT HIS HAND LYING ON HIS BREAST WAS
TALON LIKE IT WAS SO BONY AND LONG FINGERED
THE WIDOW BEGAN HER
INTRODUCTION OF ME
THE MAN'S EYES OPENED SLOWLY AND GLITTERED WICKEDLY
OUT FROM THE TWILIGHT OF THEIR CAVERNS HE FROWNED A BLACK FROWN HE
LIFTED HIS LEAN HAND AND WAVED US PEREMPTORILY AWAY
BUT THE WIDOW KEPT
STRAIGHT ON TILL SHE HAD GOT OUT THE FACT THAT I WAS A STRANGER AND
AN AMERICAN
THE MAN'S FACE CHANGED AT ONCE BRIGHTENED BECAME EVEN
EAGER AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE AND I WERE ALONE TOGETHER
I OPENED UP IN CAST IRON GERMAN HE RESPONDED IN QUITE FLEXIBLE ENGLISH
THEREAFTER WE GAVE THE GERMAN LANGUAGE A PERMANENT REST
THIS CONSUMPTIVE AND I BECAME GOOD FRIENDS
I VISITED HIM EVERY DAY
AND WE TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING
AT LEAST ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT WIVES AND
CHILDREN
LET ANYBODY'S WIFE OR ANYBODY'S CHILD BE MENTIONED AND THREE
THINGS ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE MOST GRACIOUS AND LOVING AND TENDER LIGHT
GLIMMERED IN THE MAN'S EYES FOR A MOMENT FADED OUT THE NEXT AND IN ITS
PLACE CAME THAT DEADLY LOOK WHICH HAD FLAMED THERE THE FIRST TIME I EVER
SAW HIS LIDS UNCLOSE THIRDLY HE CEASED FROM SPEECH THERE AND THEN FOR
THAT DAY LAY SILENT ABSTRACTED AND ABSORBED APPARENTLY HEARD NOTHING
THAT I SAID TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY GOOD BYES AND PLAINLY DID NOT KNOW
BY EITHER SIGHT OR HEARING WHEN I LEFT THE ROOM
WHEN I HAD BEEN THIS KARL RITTER'S DAILY AND SOLE INTIMATE DURING TWO
MONTHS HE ONE DAY SAID ABRUPTLY
'I WILL TELL YOU MY STORY
A DYING MAN S CONFESSION
THEN HE WENT ON AS FOLLOWS
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN UP UNTIL NOW
BUT NOW I HAVE GIVEN UP
I AM GOING TO
DIE
I MADE UP MY MIND LAST NIGHT THAT IT MUST BE AND VERY SOON TOO
YOU SAY YOU ARE GOING TO REVISIT YOUR RIVER BY AND BYE WHEN YOU FIND
OPPORTUNITY
VERY WELL THAT TOGETHER WITH A CERTAIN STRANGE
EXPERIENCE WHICH FELL TO MY LOT LAST NIGHT DETERMINES ME TO TELL YOU MY
HISTORY FOR YOU WILL SEE NAPOLEON ARKANSAS AND FOR MY SAKE YOU
WILL STOP THERE AND DO A CERTAIN THING FOR ME A THING WHICH YOU WILL
WILLINGLY UNDERTAKE AFTER YOU SHALL HAVE HEARD MY NARRATIVE
LET US SHORTEN THE STORY WHEREVER WE CAN FOR IT WILL NEED IT BEING
LONG
YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW I CAME TO GO TO AMERICA AND HOW I CAME TO
SETTLE IN THAT LONELY REGION IN THE SOUTH
BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT I
HAD A WIFE
MY WIFE WAS YOUNG BEAUTIFUL LOVING AND OH SO DIVINELY
GOOD AND BLAMELESS AND GENTLE AND OUR LITTLE GIRL WAS HER MOTHER IN
MINIATURE
IT WAS THE HAPPIEST OF HAPPY HOUSEHOLDS
ONE NIGHT IT WAS TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE WAR I WOKE UP OUT OF A SODDEN
LETHARGY AND FOUND MYSELF BOUND AND GAGGED AND THE AIR TAINTED WITH
CHLOROFORM I SAW TWO MEN IN THE ROOM AND ONE WAS SAYING TO THE OTHER
IN A HOARSE WHISPER 'I TOLD HER I WOULD IF SHE MADE A NOISE AND AS
FOR THE CHILD
THE OTHER MAN INTERRUPTED IN A LOW HALF CRYING VOICE
'YOU SAID WE'D ONLY GAG THEM AND ROB THEM NOT HURT THEM OR I WOULDN'T
HAVE COME
'SHUT UP YOUR WHINING HAD TO CHANGE THE PLAN WHEN THEY WAKED UP YOU
DONE ALL YOU COULD TO PROTECT THEM NOW LET THAT SATISFY YOU COME HELP
RUMMAGE
BOTH MEN WERE MASKED AND WORE COARSE RAGGED 'NIGGER' CLOTHES THEY HAD
A BULL'S EYE LANTERN AND BY ITS LIGHT I NOTICED THAT THE GENTLER ROBBER
HAD NO THUMB ON HIS RIGHT HAND
THEY RUMMAGED AROUND MY POOR CABIN FOR A
MOMENT THE HEAD BANDIT THEN SAID IN HIS STAGE WHISPER
'IT'S A WASTE OF TIME HE SHALL TELL WHERE IT'S HID
UNDO HIS GAG AND
REVIVE HIM UP
THE OTHER SAID
'ALL RIGHT PROVIDED NO CLUBBING
'NO CLUBBING IT IS THEN PROVIDED HE KEEPS STILL
THEY APPROACHED ME JUST THEN THERE WAS A SOUND OUTSIDE A SOUND OF
VOICES AND TRAMPLING HOOFS THE ROBBERS HELD THEIR BREATH AND LISTENED
THE SOUNDS CAME SLOWLY NEARER AND NEARER THEN CAME A SHOUT
HELLO THE HOUSE SHOW A LIGHT WE WANT WATER
'THE CAPTAIN'S VOICE BY G SAID THE STAGE WHISPERING RUFFIAN
AND BOTH ROBBERS FLED BY THE WAY OF THE BACK DOOR SHUTTING OFF THEIR
BULL'S EYE AS THEY RAN
THE STRANGERS SHOUTED SEVERAL TIMES MORE THEN RODE BY THERE SEEMED TO
BE A DOZEN OF THE HORSES AND I HEARD NOTHING MORE
I STRUGGLED BUT COULD NOT FREE MYSELF FROM MY BONDS
I TRIED TO SPEAK
BUT THE GAG WAS EFFECTIVE I COULD NOT MAKE A SOUND
I LISTENED FOR MY
WIFE'S VOICE AND MY CHILD'S LISTENED LONG AND INTENTLY BUT NO SOUND
CAME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE THEIR BED WAS
THIS SILENCE
BECAME MORE AND MORE AWFUL MORE AND MORE OMINOUS EVERY MOMENT
COULD
YOU HAVE ENDURED AN HOUR OF IT DO YOU THINK PITY ME THEN WHO HAD
TO ENDURE THREE
THREE HOURS IT WAS THREE AGES WHENEVER THE CLOCK
STRUCK IT SEEMED AS IF YEARS HAD GONE BY SINCE I HAD HEARD IT LAST
ALL
THIS TIME I WAS STRUGGLING IN MY BONDS AND AT LAST ABOUT DAWN I GOT
MYSELF FREE AND ROSE UP AND STRETCHED MY STIFF LIMBS
I WAS ABLE TO
DISTINGUISH DETAILS PRETTY WELL
THE FLOOR WAS LITTERED WITH THINGS
THROWN THERE BY THE ROBBERS DURING THEIR SEARCH FOR MY SAVINGS
THE
FIRST OBJECT THAT CAUGHT MY PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS A DOCUMENT OF MINE
WHICH I HAD SEEN THE ROUGHER OF THE TWO RUFFIANS GLANCE AT AND THEN CAST
AWAY
IT HAD BLOOD ON IT I STAGGERED TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
OH
POOR UNOFFENDING HELPLESS ONES THERE THEY LAY THEIR TROUBLES ENDED
MINE BEGUN
DID I APPEAL TO THE LAW I DOES IT QUENCH THE PAUPER'S THIRST IF THE
KING DRINK FOR HIM OH NO NO NO I WANTED NO IMPERTINENT INTERFERENCE
OF THE LAW
LAWS AND THE GALLOWS COULD NOT PAY THE DEBT THAT WAS OWING
TO ME LET THE LAWS LEAVE THE MATTER IN MY HANDS AND HAVE NO FEARS I
WOULD FIND THE DEBTOR AND COLLECT THE DEBT
HOW ACCOMPLISH THIS DO YOU
SAY HOW ACCOMPLISH IT AND FEEL SO SURE ABOUT IT WHEN I HAD NEITHER
SEEN THE ROBBERS' FACES NOR HEARD THEIR NATURAL VOICES NOR HAD ANY
IDEA WHO THEY MIGHT BE NEVERTHELESS I WAS SURE QUITE SURE QUITE
CONFIDENT
I HAD A CLUE A CLUE WHICH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE VALUED A CLUE
WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE GREATLY HELPED EVEN A DETECTIVE SINCE HE WOULD
LACK THE SECRET OF HOW TO APPLY IT
I SHALL COME TO THAT PRESENTLY YOU
SHALL SEE
LET US GO ON NOW TAKING THINGS IN THEIR DUE ORDER
THERE
WAS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH GAVE ME A SLANT IN A DEFINITE DIRECTION
TO BEGIN WITH THOSE TWO ROBBERS WERE MANIFESTLY SOLDIERS IN TRAMP
DISGUISE AND NOT NEW TO MILITARY SERVICE BUT OLD IN IT REGULARS
PERHAPS THEY DID NOT ACQUIRE THEIR SOLDIERLY ATTITUDE GESTURES
CARRIAGE IN A DAY NOR A MONTH NOR YET IN A YEAR
SO I THOUGHT
BUT SAID NOTHING
AND ONE OF THEM HAD SAID 'THE CAPTAIN'S VOICE
BY G THE ONE WHOSE LIFE I WOULD HAVE
TWO MILES AWAY SEVERAL
REGIMENTS WERE IN CAMP AND TWO COMPANIES OF U S
CAVALRY
WHEN I
LEARNED THAT CAPTAIN BLAKELY OF COMPANY C HAD PASSED OUR WAY THAT
NIGHT WITH AN ESCORT I SAID NOTHING BUT IN THAT COMPANY I RESOLVED TO
SEEK MY MAN
IN CONVERSATION I STUDIOUSLY AND PERSISTENTLY DESCRIBED THE
ROBBERS AS TRAMPS CAMP FOLLOWERS AND AMONG THIS CLASS THE PEOPLE MADE
USELESS SEARCH NONE SUSPECTING THE SOLDIERS BUT ME
WORKING PATIENTLY BY NIGHT IN MY DESOLATED HOME I MADE A DISGUISE FOR
MYSELF OUT OF VARIOUS ODDS AND ENDS OF CLOTHING IN THE NEAREST VILLAGE
I BOUGHT A PAIR OF BLUE GOGGLES
BY AND BYE WHEN THE MILITARY CAMP
BROKE UP AND COMPANY C WAS ORDERED A HUNDRED MILES NORTH TO NAPOLEON
I SECRETED MY SMALL HOARD OF MONEY IN MY BELT AND TOOK MY DEPARTURE IN
THE NIGHT
WHEN COMPANY C ARRIVED IN NAPOLEON I WAS ALREADY THERE
YES
I WAS THERE WITH A NEW TRADE FORTUNE TELLER
NOT TO SEEM PARTIAL I
MADE FRIENDS AND TOLD FORTUNES AMONG ALL THE COMPANIES GARRISONED THERE
BUT I GAVE COMPANY C THE GREAT BULK OF MY ATTENTIONS
I MADE MYSELF
LIMITLESSLY OBLIGING TO THESE PARTICULAR MEN THEY COULD ASK ME NO
FAVOR PUT UPON ME NO RISK WHICH I WOULD DECLINE
I BECAME THE WILLING
BUTT OF THEIR JOKES THIS PERFECTED MY POPULARITY I BECAME A FAVORITE
I EARLY FOUND A PRIVATE WHO LACKED A THUMB WHAT JOY IT WAS TO ME AND
WHEN I FOUND THAT HE ALONE OF ALL THE COMPANY HAD LOST A THUMB MY
LAST MISGIVING VANISHED I WAS SURE I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK
THIS
MAN'S NAME WAS KRUGER A GERMAN
THERE WERE NINE GERMANS IN THE COMPANY
I WATCHED TO SEE WHO MIGHT BE HIS INTIMATES BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE NO
ESPECIAL INTIMATES
BUT I WAS HIS INTIMATE AND I TOOK CARE TO MAKE
THE INTIMACY GROW
SOMETIMES I SO HUNGERED FOR MY REVENGE THAT I COULD
HARDLY RESTRAIN MYSELF FROM GOING ON MY KNEES AND BEGGING HIM TO POINT
OUT THE MAN WHO HAD MURDERED MY WIFE AND CHILD BUT I MANAGED TO BRIDLE
MY TONGUE
I BIDED MY TIME AND WENT ON TELLING FORTUNES AS OPPORTUNITY
OFFERED
MY APPARATUS WAS SIMPLE A LITTLE RED PAINT AND A BIT OF WHITE PAPER
I
PAINTED THE BALL OF THE CLIENT'S THUMB TOOK A PRINT OF IT ON THE PAPER
STUDIED IT THAT NIGHT AND REVEALED HIS FORTUNE TO HIM NEXT DAY
WHAT
WAS MY IDEA IN THIS NONSENSE IT WAS THIS WHEN I WAS A YOUTH I KNEW AN
OLD FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BEEN A PRISON KEEPER FOR THIRTY YEARS AND HE TOLD
ME THAT THERE WAS ONE THING ABOUT A PERSON WHICH NEVER CHANGED FROM
THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE THE LINES IN THE BALL OF THE THUMB AND HE SAID
THAT THESE LINES WERE NEVER EXACTLY ALIKE IN THE THUMBS OF ANY TWO HUMAN
BEINGS
IN THESE DAYS WE PHOTOGRAPH THE NEW CRIMINAL AND HANG HIS
PICTURE IN THE ROGUES' GALLERY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE BUT THAT FRENCHMAN
IN HIS DAY USED TO TAKE A PRINT OF THE BALL OF A NEW PRISONER'S THUMB
AND PUT THAT AWAY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
HE ALWAYS SAID THAT PICTURES
WERE NO GOOD FUTURE DISGUISES COULD MAKE THEM USELESS 'THE THUMB'S
THE ONLY SURE THING SAID HE 'YOU CAN'T DISGUISE THAT AND HE USED
TO PROVE HIS THEORY TOO ON MY FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES IT ALWAYS
SUCCEEDED
I WENT ON TELLING FORTUNES
EVERY NIGHT I SHUT MYSELF IN ALL ALONE
AND STUDIED THE DAY'S THUMB PRINTS WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS
IMAGINE THE
DEVOURING EAGERNESS WITH WHICH I PORED OVER THOSE MAZY RED SPIRALS
WITH THAT DOCUMENT BY MY SIDE WHICH BORE THE RIGHT HAND
THUMB AND FINGER MARKS OF THAT UNKNOWN MURDERER PRINTED WITH THE
DEAREST BLOOD TO ME THAT WAS EVER SHED ON THIS EARTH AND MANY AND
MANY A TIME I HAD TO REPEAT THE SAME OLD DISAPPOINTED REMARK 'WILL THEY
NEVER CORRESPOND
BUT MY REWARD CAME AT LAST
IT WAS THE PRINT OF THE THUMB OF THE
FORTY THIRD MAN OF COMPANY C WHOM I HAD EXPERIMENTED ON PRIVATE FRANZ
ADLER
AN HOUR BEFORE I DID NOT KNOW THE MURDERER'S NAME OR VOICE
OR FIGURE OR FACE OR NATIONALITY BUT NOW I KNEW ALL THESE THINGS
I BELIEVED I MIGHT FEEL SURE THE FRENCHMAN'S REPEATED DEMONSTRATIONS
BEING SO GOOD A WARRANTY
STILL THERE WAS A WAY TO MAKE SURE
I HAD
AN IMPRESSION OF KRUGER'S LEFT THUMB
IN THE MORNING I TOOK HIM ASIDE
WHEN HE WAS OFF DUTY AND WHEN WE WERE OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING OF
WITNESSES I SAID IMPRESSIVELY
'A PART OF YOUR FORTUNE IS SO GRAVE THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER
FOR YOU IF I DID NOT TELL IT IN PUBLIC
YOU AND ANOTHER MAN WHOSE
FORTUNE I WAS STUDYING LAST NIGHT PRIVATE ADLER HAVE BEEN MURDERING
A WOMAN AND A CHILD YOU ARE BEING DOGGED WITHIN FIVE DAYS BOTH OF YOU
WILL BE ASSASSINATED
HE DROPPED ON HIS KNEES FRIGHTENED OUT OF HIS WITS AND FOR FIVE
MINUTES HE KEPT POURING OUT THE SAME SET OF WORDS LIKE A DEMENTED
PERSON AND IN THE SAME HALF CRYING WAY WHICH WAS ONE OF MY MEMORIES OF
THAT MURDEROUS NIGHT IN MY CABIN
'I DIDN'T DO IT UPON MY SOUL I DIDN'T DO IT AND I TRIED TO KEEP HIM
FROM DOING IT I DID AS GOD IS MY WITNESS
HE DID IT ALONE
THIS WAS ALL I WANTED
AND I TRIED TO GET RID OF THE FOOL BUT NO HE
CLUNG TO ME IMPLORING ME TO SAVE HIM FROM THE ASSASSIN
HE SAID
'I HAVE MONEY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS HID AWAY THE FRUIT OF LOOT AND
THIEVERY SAVE ME TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT EVERY
PENNY
TWO THIRDS OF IT IS MY COUSIN ADLER'S BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT
ALL
WE HID IT WHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE
BUT I HID IT IN A NEW PLACE
YESTERDAY AND HAVE NOT TOLD HIM SHALL NOT TELL HIM
I WAS GOING TO
DESERT AND GET AWAY WITH IT ALL
IT IS GOLD AND TOO HEAVY TO CARRY
WHEN ONE IS RUNNING AND DODGING BUT A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN GONE OVER THE
RIVER TWO DAYS TO PREPARE MY WAY FOR ME IS GOING TO FOLLOW ME WITH IT
AND IF I GOT NO CHANCE TO DESCRIBE THE HIDING PLACE TO HER I WAS GOING
TO SLIP MY SILVER WATCH INTO HER HAND OR SEND IT TO HER AND SHE WOULD
UNDERSTAND
THERE'S A PIECE OF PAPER IN THE BACK OF THE CASE WHICH
TELLS IT ALL
HERE TAKE THE WATCH TELL ME WHAT TO DO
HE WAS TRYING TO PRESS HIS WATCH UPON ME AND WAS EXPOSING THE PAPER
AND EXPLAINING IT TO ME WHEN ADLER APPEARED ON THE SCENE ABOUT A DOZEN
YARDS AWAY
I SAID TO POOR KRUGER
'PUT UP YOUR WATCH I DON'T WANT IT
YOU SHAN'T COME TO ANY HARM
GO
NOW I MUST TELL ADLER HIS FORTUNE
PRESENTLY I WILL TELL YOU HOW TO
ESCAPE THE ASSASSIN MEANTIME I SHALL HAVE TO EXAMINE YOUR THUMBMARK
AGAIN
SAY NOTHING TO ADLER ABOUT THIS THING SAY NOTHING TO ANYBODY
HE WENT AWAY FILLED WITH FRIGHT AND GRATITUDE POOR DEVIL
I TOLD ADLER
A LONG FORTUNE PURPOSELY SO LONG THAT I COULD NOT FINISH IT PROMISED
TO COME TO HIM ON GUARD THAT NIGHT AND TELL HIM THE REALLY IMPORTANT
PART OF IT THE TRAGICAL PART OF IT I SAID SO MUST BE OUT OF REACH OF
EAVESDROPPERS
THEY ALWAYS KEPT A PICKET WATCH OUTSIDE THE TOWN MERE
DISCIPLINE AND CEREMONY NO OCCASION FOR IT NO ENEMY AROUND
TOWARD MIDNIGHT I SET OUT EQUIPPED WITH THE COUNTERSIGN AND PICKED MY
WAY TOWARD THE LONELY REGION WHERE ADLER WAS TO KEEP HIS WATCH
IT WAS
SO DARK THAT I STUMBLED RIGHT ON A DIM FIGURE ALMOST BEFORE I COULD GET
OUT A PROTECTING WORD
THE SENTINEL HAILED AND I ANSWERED BOTH AT THE
SAME MOMENT
I ADDED 'IT'S ONLY ME THE FORTUNE TELLER THEN I SLIPPED
TO THE POOR DEVIL'S SIDE AND WITHOUT A WORD I DROVE MY DIRK INTO HIS
HEART YA WOHL LAUGHED I IT WAS THE TRAGEDY PART OF HIS FORTUNE
INDEED AS HE FELL FROM HIS HORSE HE CLUTCHED AT ME AND MY BLUE
GOGGLES REMAINED IN HIS HAND AND AWAY PLUNGED THE BEAST DRAGGING HIM
WITH HIS FOOT IN THE STIRRUP
I FLED THROUGH THE WOODS AND MADE GOOD MY ESCAPE LEAVING THE ACCUSING
GOGGLES BEHIND ME IN THAT DEAD MAN'S HAND
THIS WAS FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS AGO
SINCE THEN I HAVE WANDERED
AIMLESSLY ABOUT THE EARTH SOMETIMES AT WORK SOMETIMES IDLE SOMETIMES
WITH MONEY SOMETIMES WITH NONE BUT ALWAYS TIRED OF LIFE AND WISHING
IT WAS DONE FOR MY MISSION HERE WAS FINISHED WITH THE ACT OF THAT
NIGHT AND THE ONLY PLEASURE SOLACE SATISFACTION I HAD IN ALL THOSE
TEDIOUS YEARS WAS IN THE DAILY REFLECTION 'I HAVE KILLED HIM
FOUR YEARS AGO MY HEALTH BEGAN TO FAIL
I HAD WANDERED INTO MUNICH IN
MY PURPOSELESS WAY
BEING OUT OF MONEY I SOUGHT WORK AND GOT IT DID
MY DUTY FAITHFULLY ABOUT A YEAR AND WAS THEN GIVEN THE BERTH OF NIGHT
WATCHMAN YONDER IN THAT DEAD HOUSE WHICH YOU VISITED LATELY
THE PLACE
SUITED MY MOOD
I LIKED IT
I LIKED BEING WITH THE DEAD LIKED BEING
ALONE WITH THEM
I USED TO WANDER AMONG THOSE RIGID CORPSES AND PEER
INTO THEIR AUSTERE FACES BY THE HOUR
THE LATER THE TIME THE MORE
IMPRESSIVE IT WAS I PREFERRED THE LATE TIME
SOMETIMES I TURNED THE
LIGHTS LOW THIS GAVE PERSPECTIVE YOU SEE AND THE IMAGINATION COULD
PLAY ALWAYS THE DIM RECEDING RANKS OF THE DEAD INSPIRED ONE WITH WEIRD
AND FASCINATING FANCIES
TWO YEARS AGO I HAD BEEN THERE A YEAR THEN I
WAS SITTING ALL ALONE IN THE WATCH ROOM ONE GUSTY WINTER'S NIGHT
CHILLED NUMB COMFORTLESS DROWSING GRADUALLY INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS THE
SOBBING OF THE WIND AND THE SLAMMING OF DISTANT SHUTTERS FALLING FAINTER
AND FAINTER UPON MY DULLING EAR EACH MOMENT WHEN SHARP AND SUDDENLY
THAT DEAD BELL RANG OUT A BLOOD CURDLING ALARUM OVER MY HEAD THE SHOCK
OF IT NEARLY PARALYZED ME FOR IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER HEARD
IT
I GATHERED MYSELF TOGETHER AND FLEW TO THE CORPSE ROOM
ABOUT MIDWAY
DOWN THE OUTSIDE RANK A SHROUDED FIGURE WAS SITTING UPRIGHT WAGGING
ITS HEAD SLOWLY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER A GRISLY SPECTACLE ITS SIDE
WAS TOWARD ME
I HURRIED TO IT AND PEERED INTO ITS FACE
HEAVENS IT WAS
ADLER
CAN YOU DIVINE WHAT MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS PUT INTO WORDS IT WAS THIS
'IT SEEMS THEN YOU ESCAPED ME ONCE THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENT RESULT
THIS TIME
EVIDENTLY THIS CREATURE WAS SUFFERING UNIMAGINABLE TERRORS
THINK WHAT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO WAKE UP IN THE MIDST OF THAT VOICELESS HUSH AND
LOOK OUT OVER THAT GRIM CONGREGATION OF THE DEAD WHAT GRATITUDE SHONE
IN HIS SKINNY WHITE FACE WHEN HE SAW A LIVING FORM BEFORE HIM AND HOW
THE FERVENCY OF THIS MUTE GRATITUDE WAS AUGMENTED WHEN HIS EYES FELL
UPON THE LIFE GIVING CORDIALS WHICH I CARRIED IN MY HANDS THEN IMAGINE
THE HORROR WHICH CAME INTO THIS PINCHED FACE WHEN I PUT THE CORDIALS
BEHIND ME AND SAID MOCKINGLY
'SPEAK UP FRANZ ADLER CALL UPON THESE DEAD
DOUBTLESS THEY WILL LISTEN
AND HAVE PITY BUT HERE THERE IS NONE ELSE THAT WILL
HE TRIED TO SPEAK BUT THAT PART OF THE SHROUD WHICH BOUND HIS JAWS
HELD FIRM AND WOULD NOT LET HIM
HE TRIED TO LIFT IMPLORING HANDS BUT
THEY WERE CROSSED UPON HIS BREAST AND TIED
I SAID
'SHOUT FRANZ ADLER MAKE THE SLEEPERS IN THE DISTANT STREETS HEAR YOU
AND BRING HELP
SHOUT AND LOSE NO TIME FOR THERE IS LITTLE TO LOSE
WHAT YOU CANNOT THAT IS A PITY BUT IT IS NO MATTER IT DOES NOT
ALWAYS BRING HELP
WHEN YOU AND YOUR COUSIN MURDERED A HELPLESS WOMAN
AND CHILD IN A CABIN IN ARKANSAS MY WIFE IT WAS AND MY CHILD THEY
SHRIEKED FOR HELP YOU REMEMBER BUT IT DID NO GOOD YOU REMEMBER THAT
IT DID NO GOOD IS IT NOT SO YOUR TEETH CHATTER THEN WHY CANNOT
YOU SHOUT LOOSEN THE BANDAGES WITH YOUR HANDS THEN YOU CAN
AH I
SEE YOUR HANDS ARE TIED THEY CANNOT AID YOU
HOW STRANGELY THINGS
REPEAT THEMSELVES AFTER LONG YEARS FOR MY HANDS WERE TIED THAT
NIGHT YOU REMEMBER YES TIED MUCH AS YOURS ARE NOW HOW ODD THAT IS
I COULD NOT PULL FREE
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO YOU TO UNTIE ME IT DOES NOT
OCCUR TO ME TO UNTIE YOU
SH THERE'S A LATE FOOTSTEP
IT IS
COMING THIS WAY
HARK HOW NEAR IT IS ONE CAN COUNT THE
FOOTFALLS ONE TWO THREE
THERE IT IS JUST OUTSIDE
NOW IS THE TIME
SHOUT MAN SHOUT IT IS THE ONE SOLE CHANCE BETWEEN YOU AND ETERNITY
AH YOU SEE YOU HAVE DELAYED TOO LONG IT IS GONE BY
THERE IT IS DYING
OUT
IT IS GONE THINK OF IT REFLECT UPON IT YOU HAVE HEARD A HUMAN
FOOTSTEP FOR THE LAST TIME
HOW CURIOUS IT MUST BE TO LISTEN TO SO
COMMON A SOUND AS THAT AND KNOW THAT ONE WILL NEVER HEAR THE FELLOW TO
IT AGAIN
OH MY FRIEND THE AGONY IN THAT SHROUDED FACE WAS ECSTASY TO SEE I
THOUGHT OF A NEW TORTURE AND APPLIED IT ASSISTING MYSELF WITH A TRIFLE
OF LYING INVENTION
'THAT POOR KRUGER TRIED TO SAVE MY WIFE AND CHILD AND I DID HIM A
GRATEFUL GOOD TURN FOR IT WHEN THE TIME CAME
I PERSUADED HIM TO
ROB YOU AND I AND A WOMAN HELPED HIM TO DESERT AND GOT HIM AWAY IN
SAFETY A LOOK AS OF SURPRISE AND TRIUMPH SHONE OUT DIMLY THROUGH THE
ANGUISH IN MY VICTIM'S FACE
I WAS DISTURBED DISQUIETED
I SAID
'WHAT THEN DIDN'T HE ESCAPE
A NEGATIVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD
'NO WHAT HAPPENED THEN
THE SATISFACTION IN THE SHROUDED FACE WAS STILL PLAINER
THE MAN TRIED
TO MUMBLE OUT SOME WORDS COULD NOT SUCCEED TRIED TO EXPRESS SOMETHING
WITH HIS OBSTRUCTED HANDS FAILED PAUSED A MOMENT THEN FEEBLY TILTED
HIS HEAD IN A MEANING WAY TOWARD THE CORPSE THAT LAY NEAREST HIM
'DEAD I ASKED
'FAILED TO ESCAPE CAUGHT IN THE ACT AND SHOT
NEGATIVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD
'HOW THEN
AGAIN THE MAN TRIED TO DO SOMETHING WITH HIS HANDS
I WATCHED CLOSELY
BUT COULD NOT GUESS THE INTENT
I BENT OVER AND WATCHED STILL MORE
INTENTLY
HE HAD TWISTED A THUMB AROUND AND WAS WEAKLY PUNCHING AT HIS
BREAST WITH IT
'AH STABBED DO YOU MEAN
AFFIRMATIVE NOD ACCOMPANIED BY A SPECTRAL SMILE OF SUCH PECULIAR
DEVILISHNESS THAT IT STRUCK AN AWAKENING LIGHT THROUGH MY DULL BRAIN
AND I CRIED
'DID I STAB HIM MISTAKING HIM FOR YOU FOR THAT STROKE WAS MEANT FOR
NONE BUT YOU
THE AFFIRMATIVE NOD OF THE RE DYING RASCAL WAS AS JOYOUS AS HIS FAILING
STRENGTH WAS ABLE TO PUT INTO ITS EXPRESSION
'O MISERABLE MISERABLE ME TO SLAUGHTER THE PITYING SOUL THAT STOOD A
FRIEND TO MY DARLINGS WHEN THEY WERE HELPLESS AND WOULD HAVE SAVED THEM
IF HE COULD MISERABLE OH MISERABLE MISERABLE ME
I FANCIED I HEARD THE MUFFLED GURGLE OF A MOCKING LAUGH
I TOOK MY FACE
OUT OF MY HANDS AND SAW MY ENEMY SINKING BACK UPON HIS INCLINED BOARD
HE WAS A SATISFACTORY LONG TIME DYING
HE HAD A WONDERFUL VITALITY AN
ASTONISHING CONSTITUTION
YES HE WAS A PLEASANT LONG TIME AT IT
I GOT
A CHAIR AND A NEWSPAPER AND SAT DOWN BY HIM AND READ
OCCASIONALLY I
TOOK A SIP OF BRANDY
THIS WAS NECESSARY ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD
BUT I
DID IT PARTLY BECAUSE I SAW THAT ALONG AT FIRST WHENEVER I REACHED
FOR THE BOTTLE HE THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM SOME
I READ ALOUD
MAINLY IMAGINARY ACCOUNTS OF PEOPLE SNATCHED FROM THE GRAVE'S THRESHOLD
AND RESTORED TO LIFE AND VIGOR BY A FEW SPOONSFUL OF LIQUOR AND A WARM
BATH
YES HE HAD A LONG HARD DEATH OF IT THREE HOURS AND SIX MINUTES
FROM THE TIME HE RANG HIS BELL
IT IS BELIEVED THAT IN ALL THESE EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT HAVE ELAPSED
SINCE THE INSTITUTION OF THE CORPSE WATCH NO SHROUDED OCCUPANT OF THE
BAVARIAN DEAD HOUSES HAS EVER RUNG ITS BELL
WELL IT IS A HARMLESS
BELIEF
LET IT STAND AT THAT
THE CHILL OF THAT DEATH ROOM HAD PENETRATED MY BONES
IT REVIVED AND
FASTENED UPON ME THE DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN AFFLICTING ME BUT WHICH UP
TO THAT NIGHT HAD BEEN STEADILY DISAPPEARING
THAT MAN MURDERED MY WIFE
AND MY CHILD AND IN THREE DAYS HENCE HE WILL HAVE ADDED ME TO HIS LIST
NO MATTER GOD HOW DELICIOUS THE MEMORY OF IT I CAUGHT HIM ESCAPING
FROM HIS GRAVE AND THRUST HIM BACK INTO IT
AFTER THAT NIGHT I WAS CONFINED TO MY BED FOR A WEEK BUT AS SOON AS
I COULD GET ABOUT I WENT TO THE DEAD HOUSE BOOKS AND GOT THE NUMBER OF
THE HOUSE WHICH ADLER HAD DIED IN
A WRETCHED LODGING HOUSE IT WAS
IT WAS MY IDEA THAT HE WOULD NATURALLY HAVE GOTTEN HOLD OF KRUGER'S
EFFECTS BEING HIS COUSIN AND I WANTED TO GET KRUGER'S WATCH IF I
COULD
BUT WHILE I WAS SICK ADLER'S THINGS HAD BEEN SOLD AND SCATTERED
ALL EXCEPT A FEW OLD LETTERS AND SOME ODDS AND ENDS OF NO VALUE
HOWEVER THROUGH THOSE LETTERS I TRACED OUT A SON OF KRUGER'S THE
ONLY RELATIVE LEFT
HE IS A MAN OF THIRTY NOW A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE
AND LIVING AT NO
14 KONIGSTRASSE MANNHEIM WIDOWER WITH SEVERAL SMALL
CHILDREN
WITHOUT EXPLAINING TO HIM WHY I HAVE FURNISHED TWO THIRDS OF
HIS SUPPORT EVER SINCE
NOW AS TO THAT WATCH SEE HOW STRANGELY THINGS HAPPEN I TRACED IT
AROUND AND ABOUT GERMANY FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AT CONSIDERABLE COST IN
MONEY AND VEXATION AND AT LAST I GOT IT
GOT IT AND WAS UNSPEAKABLY
GLAD OPENED IT AND FOUND NOTHING IN IT WHY I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THAT
THAT BIT OF PAPER WAS NOT GOING TO STAY THERE ALL THIS TIME
OF COURSE
I GAVE UP THAT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THEN GAVE IT UP AND DROPPED IT OUT
OF MY MIND AND MOST SORROWFULLY FOR I HAD WANTED IT FOR KRUGER'S SON
LAST NIGHT WHEN I CONSENTED AT LAST THAT I MUST DIE I BEGAN TO MAKE
READY
I PROCEEDED TO BURN ALL USELESS PAPERS AND SURE ENOUGH FROM A
BATCH OF ADLER'S NOT PREVIOUSLY EXAMINED WITH THOROUGHNESS OUT DROPPED
THAT LONG DESIRED SCRAP I RECOGNIZED IT IN A MOMENT
HERE IT IS I WILL
TRANSLATE IT
'BRICK LIVERY STABLE STONE FOUNDATION MIDDLE OF TOWN CORNER OF
ORLEANS AND MARKET
CORNER TOWARD COURT HOUSE
THIRD STONE FOURTH ROW
STICK NOTICE THERE SAYING HOW MANY ARE TO COME
THERE TAKE IT AND PRESERVE IT
KRUGER EXPLAINED THAT THAT STONE WAS
REMOVABLE AND THAT IT WAS IN THE NORTH WALL OF THE FOUNDATION FOURTH
ROW FROM THE TOP AND THIRD STONE FROM THE WEST
THE MONEY IS SECRETED
BEHIND IT
HE SAID THE CLOSING SENTENCE WAS A BLIND TO MISLEAD IN
CASE THE PAPER SHOULD FALL INTO WRONG HANDS
IT PROBABLY PERFORMED THAT
OFFICE FOR ADLER
NOW I WANT TO BEG THAT WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR INTENDED JOURNEY DOWN THE
RIVER YOU WILL HUNT OUT THAT HIDDEN MONEY AND SEND IT TO ADAM KRUGER
CARE OF THE MANNHEIM ADDRESS WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED
IT WILL MAKE A RICH
MAN OF HIM AND I SHALL SLEEP THE SOUNDER IN MY GRAVE FOR KNOWING THAT I
HAVE DONE WHAT I COULD FOR THE SON OF THE MAN WHO TRIED TO SAVE MY
WIFE AND CHILD ALBEIT MY HAND IGNORANTLY STRUCK HIM DOWN WHEREAS THE
IMPULSE OF MY HEART WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SHIELD AND SERVE HIM
CHAPTER 32
THE DISPOSAL OF A BONANZA
'SUCH WAS RITTER'S NARRATIVE SAID I TO MY TWO FRIENDS
THERE WAS A
PROFOUND AND IMPRESSIVE SILENCE WHICH LASTED A CONSIDERABLE TIME THEN
BOTH MEN BROKE INTO A FUSILLADE OF EXCITING AND ADMIRING EJACULATIONS
OVER THE STRANGE INCIDENTS OF THE TALE AND THIS ALONG WITH A RATTLING
FIRE OF QUESTIONS WAS KEPT UP UNTIL ALL HANDS WERE ABOUT OUT OF BREATH
THEN MY FRIENDS BEGAN TO COOL DOWN AND DRAW OFF UNDER SHELTER OF
OCCASIONAL VOLLEYS INTO SILENCE AND ABYSMAL REVERIE
FOR TEN MINUTES
NOW THERE WAS STILLNESS
THEN ROGERS SAID DREAMILY
'TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
ADDING AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE
'TEN THOUSAND
IT IS A HEAP OF MONEY
PRESENTLY THE POET INQUIRED
'ARE YOU GOING TO SEND IT TO HIM RIGHT AWAY
'YES I SAID
'IT IS A QUEER QUESTION
NO REPLY
AFTER A LITTLE ROGERS ASKED HESITATINGLY
ALL OF IT THAT IS I MEAN
'CERTAINLY ALL OF IT
I WAS GOING TO SAY MORE BUT STOPPED WAS STOPPED BY A TRAIN OF THOUGHT
WHICH STARTED UP IN ME
THOMPSON SPOKE BUT MY MIND WAS ABSENT AND I
DID NOT CATCH WHAT HE SAID
BUT I HEARD ROGERS ANSWER
'YES IT SEEMS SO TO ME
IT OUGHT TO BE QUITE SUFFICIENT FOR I DON'T
SEE THAT HE HAS DONE ANYTHING
PRESENTLY THE POET SAID
'WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT IT IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
JUST LOOK AT
IT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHY HE COULDN'T SPEND IT IN A LIFETIME AND
IT WOULD INJURE HIM TOO PERHAPS RUIN HIM YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THAT
IN A LITTLE WHILE HE WOULD THROW HIS LAST AWAY SHUT UP HIS SHOP MAYBE
TAKE TO DRINKING MALTREAT HIS MOTHERLESS CHILDREN DRIFT INTO OTHER
EVIL COURSES GO STEADILY FROM BAD TO WORSE
'YES THAT'S IT INTERRUPTED ROGERS FERVENTLY 'I'VE SEEN IT A HUNDRED
TIMES YES MORE THAN A HUNDRED
YOU PUT MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF A MAN
LIKE THAT IF YOU WANT TO DESTROY HIM THAT'S ALL JUST PUT MONEY INTO
HIS HANDS IT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO AND IF IT DON'T PULL HIM DOWN
AND TAKE ALL THE USEFULNESS OUT OF HIM AND ALL THE SELF RESPECT AND
EVERYTHING THEN I DON'T KNOW HUMAN NATURE AIN'T THAT SO THOMPSON
AND EVEN IF WE WERE TO GIVE HIM A THIRD OF IT WHY IN LESS THAN SIX
MONTHS
'LESS THAN SIX WEEKS YOU'D BETTER SAY SAID I WARMING UP AND
BREAKING IN
'UNLESS HE HAD THAT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SAFE HANDS
WHERE HE COULDN'T TOUCH IT HE WOULD NO MORE LAST YOU SIX WEEKS THAN
'OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T SAID THOMPSON 'I'VE EDITED BOOKS FOR
THAT KIND OF PEOPLE AND THE MOMENT THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON THE
ROYALTY MAYBE IT'S THREE THOUSAND MAYBE IT'S TWO THOUSAND
'WHAT BUSINESS HAS THAT SHOEMAKER WITH TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS I SHOULD
LIKE TO KNOW BROKE IN ROGERS EARNESTLY
'A MAN PERHAPS PERFECTLY
CONTENTED NOW THERE IN MANNHEIM SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN CLASS EATING
HIS BREAD WITH THE APPETITE WHICH LABORIOUS INDUSTRY ALONE CAN
GIVE ENJOYING HIS HUMBLE LIFE HONEST UPRIGHT PURE IN HEART AND
BLEST YES I SAY BLEST BLEST ABOVE ALL THE MYRIADS THAT GO IN SILK
ATTIRE AND WALK THE EMPTY ARTIFICIAL ROUND OF SOCIAL FOLLY BUT JUST
YOU PUT THAT TEMPTATION BEFORE HIM ONCE JUST YOU LAY FIFTEEN HUNDRED
DOLLARS BEFORE A MAN LIKE THAT AND SAY
'FIFTEEN HUNDRED DEVILS CRIED I FIVE HUNDRED WOULD ROT HIS
PRINCIPLES PARALYZE HIS INDUSTRY DRAG HIM TO THE RUMSHOP THENCE TO
THE GUTTER THENCE TO THE ALMSHOUSE THENCE TO
WHY PUT UPON OURSELVES THIS CRIME GENTLEMEN INTERRUPTED THE POET
EARNESTLY AND APPEALINGLY
'HE IS HAPPY WHERE HE IS AND AS HE IS
EVERY SENTIMENT OF HONOR EVERY SENTIMENT OF CHARITY EVERY SENTIMENT OF
HIGH AND SACRED BENEVOLENCE WARNS US BESEECHES US COMMANDS US TO LEAVE
HIM UNDISTURBED
THAT IS REAL FRIENDSHIP THAT IS TRUE FRIENDSHIP
WE
COULD FOLLOW OTHER COURSES THAT WOULD BE MORE SHOWY BUT NONE THAT WOULD
BE SO TRULY KIND AND WISE DEPEND UPON IT
AFTER SOME FURTHER TALK IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT EACH OF US DOWN IN HIS
HEART FELT SOME MISGIVINGS OVER THIS SETTLEMENT OF THE MATTER
IT
WAS MANIFEST THAT WE ALL FELT THAT WE OUGHT TO SEND THE POOR SHOEMAKER
SOMETHING
THERE WAS LONG AND THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION OF THIS POINT AND
WE FINALLY DECIDED TO SEND HIM A CHROMO
WELL NOW THAT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED SATISFACTORILY TO
EVERYBODY CONCERNED A NEW TROUBLE BROKE OUT IT TRANSPIRED THAT THESE
TWO MEN WERE EXPECTING TO SHARE EQUALLY IN THE MONEY WITH ME
THAT WAS
NOT MY IDEA
I SAID THAT IF THEY GOT HALF OF IT BETWEEN THEM THEY MIGHT
CONSIDER THEMSELVES LUCKY
ROGERS SAID
'WHO WOULD HAVE HAD ANY IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR ME I FLUNG OUT THE
FIRST HINT BUT FOR THAT IT WOULD ALL HAVE GONE TO THE SHOEMAKER
THOMPSON SAID THAT HE WAS THINKING OF THE THING HIMSELF AT THE VERY
MOMENT THAT ROGERS HAD ORIGINALLY SPOKEN
I RETORTED THAT THE IDEA WOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO ME PLENTY SOON ENOUGH
AND WITHOUT ANYBODY'S HELP
I WAS SLOW ABOUT THINKING MAYBE BUT I WAS
SURE
THIS MATTER WARMED UP INTO A QUARREL THEN INTO A FIGHT AND EACH MAN
GOT PRETTY BADLY BATTERED
AS SOON AS I HAD GOT MYSELF MENDED UP AFTER
A FASHION I ASCENDED TO THE HURRICANE DECK IN A PRETTY SOUR HUMOR
I
FOUND CAPTAIN MCCORD THERE AND SAID AS PLEASANTLY AS MY HUMOR WOULD
PERMIT
'I HAVE COME TO SAY GOOD BYE CAPTAIN
I WISH TO GO ASHORE AT NAPOLEON
'GO ASHORE WHERE
'NAPOLEON
THE CAPTAIN LAUGHED BUT SEEING THAT I WAS NOT IN A JOVIAL MOOD STOPPED
THAT AND SAID
'BUT ARE YOU SERIOUS
'SERIOUS I CERTAINLY AM
THE CAPTAIN GLANCED UP AT THE PILOT HOUSE AND SAID
'HE WANTS TO GET OFF AT NAPOLEON
'NAPOLEON
'THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS
'GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST
UNCLE MUMFORD APPROACHED ALONG THE DECK
THE CAPTAIN SAID
'UNCLE HERE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS WANTS TO GET OFF AT NAPOLEON
'WELL BY
I SAID
'COME WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT CAN'T A MAN GO ASHORE AT NAPOLEON IF HE
WANTS TO
'WHY HANG IT DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T ANY NAPOLEON ANY MORE
HASN'T BEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS
THE ARKANSAS RIVER BURST THROUGH IT
TORE IT ALL TO RAGS AND EMPTIED IT INTO THE MISSISSIPPI
'CARRIED THE WHOLE TOWN AWAY BANKS CHURCHES JAILS
NEWSPAPER OFFICES COURT HOUSE THEATER FIRE DEPARTMENT LIVERY STABLE
EVERYTHING
'EVERYTHING
JUST A FIFTEEN MINUTE JOB OR SUCH A MATTER
DIDN'T LEAVE
HIDE NOR HAIR SHRED NOR SHINGLE OF IT EXCEPT THE FAG END OF A SHANTY
AND ONE BRICK CHIMNEY
THIS BOAT IS PADDLING ALONG RIGHT NOW WHERE THE
DEAD CENTER OF THAT TOWN USED TO BE YONDER IS THE BRICK CHIMNEY ALL
THAT'S LEFT OF NAPOLEON
THESE DENSE WOODS ON THE RIGHT USED TO BE A
MILE BACK OF THE TOWN
TAKE A LOOK BEHIND YOU UP STREAM NOW YOU BEGIN
TO RECOGNIZE THIS COUNTRY DON'T YOU
'YES I DO RECOGNIZE IT NOW
IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING I EVER HEARD
OF BY A LONG SHOT THE MOST WONDERFUL AND UNEXPECTED
MR
THOMPSON AND MR
ROGERS HAD ARRIVED MEANTIME WITH SATCHELS AND
UMBRELLAS AND HAD SILENTLY LISTENED TO THE CAPTAIN'S NEWS
THOMPSON PUT
A HALF DOLLAR IN MY HAND AND SAID SOFTLY
'FOR MY SHARE OF THE CHROMO
ROGERS FOLLOWED SUIT
YES IT WAS AN ASTONISHING THING TO SEE THE MISSISSIPPI ROLLING BETWEEN
UNPEOPLED SHORES AND STRAIGHT OVER THE SPOT WHERE I USED TO SEE A GOOD
BIG SELF COMPLACENT TOWN TWENTY YEARS AGO
TOWN THAT WAS COUNTY SEAT
OF A GREAT AND IMPORTANT COUNTY TOWN WITH A BIG UNITED STATES MARINE
HOSPITAL TOWN OF INNUMERABLE FIGHTS AN INQUEST EVERY DAY TOWN WHERE
I HAD USED TO KNOW THE PRETTIEST GIRL AND THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED IN THE
WHOLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TOWN WHERE WE WERE HANDED THE FIRST PRINTED
NEWS OF THE 'PENNSYLVANIA'S' MOURNFUL DISASTER A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
AGO A TOWN NO MORE SWALLOWED UP VANISHED GONE TO FEED THE FISHES
NOTHING LEFT BUT A FRAGMENT OF A SHANTY AND A CRUMBLING BRICK CHIMNEY
CHAPTER 33
REFRESHMENTS AND ETHICS
IN REGARD TO ISLAND 74 WHICH IS SITUATED NOT FAR FROM THE FORMER
NAPOLEON A FREAK OF THE RIVER HERE HAS SORELY PERPLEXED THE LAWS OF
MEN AND MADE THEM A VANITY AND A JEST
WHEN THE STATE OF ARKANSAS WAS
CHARTERED SHE CONTROLLED 'TO THE CENTER OF THE RIVER' A MOST UNSTABLE
LINE
THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI CLAIMED 'TO THE CHANNEL' ANOTHER SHIFTY
AND UNSTABLE LINE
NO
74 BELONGED TO ARKANSAS
BY AND BY A CUT OFF
THREW THIS BIG ISLAND OUT OF ARKANSAS AND YET NOT WITHIN MISSISSIPPI
'MIDDLE OF THE RIVER' ON ONE SIDE OF IT 'CHANNEL' ON THE OTHER
THAT
IS AS I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
WHETHER I HAVE GOT THE DETAILS RIGHT
OR WRONG THIS FACT REMAINS THAT HERE IS THIS BIG AND EXCEEDINGLY
VALUABLE ISLAND OF FOUR THOUSAND ACRES THRUST OUT IN THE COLD AND
BELONGING TO NEITHER THE ONE STATE NOR THE OTHER PAYING TAXES TO
NEITHER OWING ALLEGIANCE TO NEITHER
ONE MAN OWNS THE WHOLE ISLAND AND
OF RIGHT IS 'THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY
ISLAND 92 BELONGS TO ARKANSAS
THE RIVER MOVED IT OVER AND JOINED IT
TO MISSISSIPPI
A CHAP ESTABLISHED A WHISKEY SHOP THERE WITHOUT A
MISSISSIPPI LICENSE AND ENRICHED HIMSELF UPON MISSISSIPPI CUSTOM UNDER
ARKANSAS PROTECTION WHERE NO LICENSE WAS IN THOSE DAYS REQUIRED
WE GLIDED STEADILY DOWN THE RIVER IN THE USUAL PRIVACY STEAMBOAT OR
OTHER MOVING THING SELDOM SEEN
SCENERY AS ALWAYS STRETCH UPON STRETCH
OF ALMOST UNBROKEN FOREST ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER SOUNDLESS
SOLITUDE
HERE AND THERE A CABIN OR TWO STANDING IN SMALL OPENINGS ON
THE GRAY AND GRASSLESS BANKS CABINS WHICH HAD FORMERLY STOOD A QUARTER
OR HALF MILE FARTHER TO THE FRONT AND GRADUALLY BEEN PULLED FARTHER
AND FARTHER BACK AS THE SHORES CAVED IN
AS AT PILCHER'S POINT FOR
INSTANCE WHERE THE CABINS HAD BEEN MOVED BACK THREE HUNDRED YARDS IN
THREE MONTHS SO WE WERE TOLD BUT THE CAVING BANKS HAD ALREADY CAUGHT
UP WITH THEM AND THEY WERE BEING CONVEYED REARWARD ONCE MORE
NAPOLEON HAD BUT SMALL OPINION OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI IN THE OLD
TIMES BUT BEHOLD NAPOLEON IS GONE TO THE CAT FISHES AND HERE IS
GREENVILLE FULL OF LIFE AND ACTIVITY AND MAKING A CONSIDERABLE FLOURISH
IN THE VALLEY HAVING THREE THOUSAND INHABITANTS IT IS SAID AND DOING
A GROSS TRADE OF 2 500 000 ANNUALLY
A GROWING TOWN
THERE WAS MUCH TALK ON THE BOAT ABOUT THE CALHOUN LAND COMPANY AN
ENTERPRISE WHICH IS EXPECTED TO WORK WHOLESOME RESULTS
COLONEL CALHOUN
A GRANDSON OF THE STATESMAN WENT TO BOSTON AND FORMED A SYNDICATE
WHICH PURCHASED A LARGE TRACT OF LAND ON THE RIVER IN CHICOT COUNTY
ARKANSAS SOME TEN THOUSAND ACRES FOR COTTON GROWING
THE PURPOSE IS TO
WORK ON A CASH BASIS BUY AT FIRST HANDS AND HANDLE THEIR OWN PRODUCT
SUPPLY THEIR NEGRO LABORERS WITH PROVISIONS AND NECESSARIES AT A
TRIFLING PROFIT SAY 8 OR 10 PER CENT FURNISH THEM COMFORTABLE
QUARTERS ETC AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO SAVE MONEY AND REMAIN ON THE
PLACE
IF THIS PROVES A FINANCIAL SUCCESS AS SEEMS QUITE CERTAIN THEY
PROPOSE TO ESTABLISH A BANKING HOUSE IN GREENVILLE AND LEND MONEY AT AN
UNBURDENSOME RATE OF INTEREST 6 PER CENT
IS SPOKEN OF
THE TROUBLE HERETOFORE HAS BEEN I AM QUOTING REMARKS OF PLANTERS AND
STEAMBOATMEN THAT THE PLANTERS ALTHOUGH OWNING THE LAND WERE WITHOUT
CASH CAPITAL HAD TO HYPOTHECATE BOTH LAND AND CROP TO CARRY ON THE
BUSINESS
CONSEQUENTLY THE COMMISSION DEALER WHO FURNISHES THE MONEY
TAKES SOME RISK AND DEMANDS BIG INTEREST USUALLY 10 PER CENT AND
2 HALF PER CENT
FOR NEGOTIATING THE LOAN
THE PLANTER HAS ALSO TO BUY
HIS SUPPLIES THROUGH THE SAME DEALER PAYING COMMISSIONS AND PROFITS
THEN WHEN HE SHIPS HIS CROP THE DEALER ADDS HIS COMMISSIONS INSURANCE
ETC
SO TAKING IT BY AND LARGE AND FIRST AND LAST THE DEALER'S SHARE
OF THAT CROP IS ABOUT 25 PER CENT FOOTNOTE 'BUT WHAT CAN THE STATE DO
WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE UNDER SUBJECTION TO RATES OF INTEREST RANGING FROM
18 TO 30 PER CENT AND ARE ALSO UNDER THE NECESSITY OF PURCHASING THEIR
CROPS IN ADVANCE EVEN OF PLANTING AT THESE RATES FOR THE PRIVILEGE
OF PURCHASING ALL THEIR SUPPLIES AT 100 PER CENT
PROFIT EDWARD
ATKINSON
A COTTON PLANTER'S ESTIMATE OF THE AVERAGE MARGIN OF PROFIT ON PLANTING
IN HIS SECTION ONE MAN AND MULE WILL RAISE TEN ACRES OF COTTON GIVING
TEN BALES COTTON WORTH SAY 500 COST OF PRODUCING SAY 350 NET
PROFIT 150 OR 15 PER ACRE
THERE IS ALSO A PROFIT NOW FROM
THE COTTON SEED WHICH FORMERLY HAD LITTLE VALUE NONE WHERE MUCH
TRANSPORTATION WAS NECESSARY
IN SIXTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS CRUDE COTTON
FOUR HUNDRED ARE LINT WORTH SAY TEN CENTS A POUND AND TWELVE HUNDRED
POUNDS OF SEED WORTH 12 OR 13 PER TON
MAYBE IN FUTURE EVEN THE STEMS
WILL NOT BE THROWN AWAY
MR
EDWARD ATKINSON SAYS THAT FOR EACH BALE
OF COTTON THERE ARE FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF STEMS AND THAT THESE ARE
VERY RICH IN PHOSPHATE OF LIME AND POTASH THAT WHEN GROUND AND MIXED
WITH ENSILAGE OR COTTON SEED MEAL WHICH IS TOO RICH FOR USE AS FODDER
IN LARGE QUANTITIES THE STEM MIXTURE MAKES A SUPERIOR FOOD RICH IN
ALL THE ELEMENTS NEEDED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MILK MEAT AND BONE
HERETOFORE THE STEMS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A NUISANCE
COMPLAINT IS MADE THAT THE PLANTER REMAINS GROUTY TOWARD THE FORMER
SLAVE SINCE THE WAR WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT A CHILL BUSINESS RELATION
WITH HIM NO SENTIMENT PERMITTED TO INTRUDE WILL NOT KEEP A 'STORE'
HIMSELF AND SUPPLY THE NEGRO'S WANTS AND THUS PROTECT THE NEGRO'S
POCKET AND MAKE HIM ABLE AND WILLING TO STAY ON THE PLACE AND AN
ADVANTAGE TO HIM TO DO IT BUT LETS THAT PRIVILEGE TO SOME THRIFTY
ISRAELITE WHO ENCOURAGES THE THOUGHTLESS NEGRO AND WIFE TO BUY ALL
SORTS OF THINGS WHICH THEY COULD DO WITHOUT BUY ON CREDIT AT BIG
PRICES MONTH AFTER MONTH CREDIT BASED ON THE NEGRO'S SHARE OF THE
GROWING CROP AND AT THE END OF THE SEASON THE NEGRO'S SHARE BELONGS
TO THE ISRAELITE THE NEGRO IS IN DEBT BESIDES IS DISCOURAGED
DISSATISFIED RESTLESS AND BOTH HE AND THE PLANTER ARE INJURED FOR HE
WILL TAKE STEAMBOAT AND MIGRATE AND THE PLANTER MUST GET A STRANGER IN
HIS PLACE WHO DOES NOT KNOW HIM DOES NOT CARE FOR HIM WILL FATTEN THE
ISRAELITE A SEASON AND FOLLOW HIS PREDECESSOR PER STEAMBOAT
IT IS HOPED THAT THE CALHOUN COMPANY WILL SHOW BY ITS HUMANE AND
PROTECTIVE TREATMENT OF ITS LABORERS THAT ITS METHOD IS THE MOST
PROFITABLE FOR BOTH PLANTER AND NEGRO AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT A GENERAL
ADOPTION OF THAT METHOD WILL THEN FOLLOW
AND WHERE SO MANY ARE SAYING THEIR SAY SHALL NOT THE BARKEEPER TESTIFY
HE IS THOUGHTFUL OBSERVANT NEVER DRINKS ENDEAVORS TO EARN HIS SALARY
AND WOULD EARN IT IF THERE WERE CUSTOM ENOUGH
HE SAYS THE PEOPLE
ALONG HERE IN MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA WILL SEND UP THE RIVER TO BUY
VEGETABLES RATHER THAN RAISE THEM AND THEY WILL COME ABOARD AT THE
LANDINGS AND BUY FRUITS OF THE BARKEEPER
THINKS THEY 'DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING BUT COTTON BELIEVES THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO RAISE VEGETABLES
AND FRUIT 'AT LEAST THE MOST OF THEM SAYS 'A NIGGER WILL GO TO H FOR
A WATERMELON' 'H' IS ALL I FIND IN THE STENOGRAPHER'S REPORT MEANS
HALIFAX PROBABLY THOUGH THAT SEEMS A GOOD WAY TO GO FOR A WATERMELON
BARKEEPER BUYS WATERMELONS FOR FIVE CENTS UP THE RIVER BRINGS THEM
DOWN AND SELLS THEM FOR FIFTY
'WHY DOES HE MIX SUCH ELABORATE AND
PICTURESQUE DRINKS FOR THE NIGGER HANDS ON THE BOAT BECAUSE THEY WON'T
HAVE ANY OTHER
'THEY WANT A BIG DRINK DON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT
YOU MAKE IT OF THEY WANT THE WORTH OF THEIR MONEY
YOU GIVE A NIGGER A
PLAIN GILL OF HALF A DOLLAR BRANDY FOR FIVE CENTS WILL HE TOUCH IT NO
AIN'T SIZE ENOUGH TO IT
BUT YOU PUT UP A PINT OF ALL KINDS OF WORTHLESS
RUBBISH AND HEAVE IN SOME RED STUFF TO MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL RED'S THE
MAIN THING AND HE WOULDN'T PUT DOWN THAT GLASS TO GO TO A CIRCUS
ALL THE BARS ON THIS ANCHOR LINE ARE RENTED AND OWNED BY ONE FIRM
THEY FURNISH THE LIQUORS FROM THEIR OWN ESTABLISHMENT AND HIRE THE
BARKEEPERS 'ON SALARY GOOD LIQUORS YES ON SOME OF THE BOATS WHERE
THERE ARE THE KIND OF PASSENGERS THAT WANT IT AND CAN PAY FOR IT
ON
THE OTHER BOATS NO
NOBODY BUT THE DECK HANDS AND FIREMEN TO DRINK IT
'BRANDY YES I'VE GOT BRANDY PLENTY OF IT BUT YOU DON'T WANT ANY OF
IT UNLESS YOU'VE MADE YOUR WILL IT ISN'T AS IT USED TO BE IN THE
OLD TIMES
THEN EVERYBODY TRAVELED BY STEAMBOAT EVERYBODY DRANK AND
EVERYBODY TREATED EVERYBODY ELSE
'NOW MOST EVERYBODY GOES BY RAILROAD
AND THE REST DON'T DRINK IN THE OLD TIMES THE BARKEEPER OWNED THE BAR
HIMSELF 'AND WAS GAY AND SMARTY AND TALKY AND ALL JEWELED UP AND WAS
THE TONIEST ARISTOCRAT ON THE BOAT USED TO MAKE 2 000 ON A TRIP
A
FATHER WHO LEFT HIS SON A STEAMBOAT BAR LEFT HIM A FORTUNE
NOW HE
LEAVES HIM BOARD AND LODGING YES AND WASHING IF A SHIRT A TRIP WILL
DO
YES INDEEDY TIMES ARE CHANGED
WHY DO YOU KNOW ON THE PRINCIPAL
LINE OF BOATS ON THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI THEY DON'T HAVE ANY BAR AT ALL
SOUNDS LIKE POETRY BUT IT'S THE PETRIFIED TRUTH
CHAPTER 34
TOUGH YARNS
STACK ISLAND
I REMEMBERED STACK ISLAND ALSO LAKE PROVIDENCE
LOUISIANA WHICH IS THE FIRST DISTINCTLY SOUTHERN LOOKING TOWN YOU COME
TO DOWNWARD BOUND LIES LEVEL AND LOW SHADE TREES HUNG WITH VENERABLE
GRAY BEARDS OF SPANISH MOSS 'RESTFUL PENSIVE SUNDAY ASPECT ABOUT THE
PLACE COMMENTS UNCLE MUMFORD WITH FEELING ALSO WITH TRUTH
A MR
H
FURNISHED SOME MINOR DETAILS OF FACT CONCERNING THIS REGION
WHICH I WOULD HAVE HESITATED TO BELIEVE IF I HAD NOT KNOWN HIM TO BE A
STEAMBOAT MATE
HE WAS A PASSENGER OF OURS A RESIDENT OF ARKANSAS CITY
AND BOUND TO VICKSBURG TO JOIN HIS BOAT A LITTLE SUNFLOWER PACKET
HE WAS AN AUSTERE MAN AND HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING SINGULARLY
UNWORLDLY FOR A RIVER MAN
AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SAID THAT ARKANSAS
HAD BEEN INJURED AND KEPT BACK BY GENERATIONS OF EXAGGERATIONS
CONCERNING THE MOSQUITOES HERE
ONE MAY SMILE SAID HE AND TURN THE
MATTER OFF AS BEING A SMALL THING BUT WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT THE
EFFECTS PRODUCED IN THE WAY OF DISCOURAGEMENT OF IMMIGRATION AND
DIMINISHED VALUES OF PROPERTY IT WAS QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF A SMALL
THING OR THING IN ANY WISE TO BE COUGHED DOWN OR SNEERED AT
THESE
MOSQUITOES HAD BEEN PERSISTENTLY REPRESENTED AS BEING FORMIDABLE AND
LAWLESS WHEREAS 'THE TRUTH IS THEY ARE FEEBLE INSIGNIFICANT IN SIZE
DIFFIDENT TO A FAULT SENSITIVE' AND SO ON AND SO ON YOU WOULD HAVE
SUPPOSED HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS FAMILY
BUT IF HE WAS SOFT ON THE
ARKANSAS MOSQUITOES HE WAS HARD ENOUGH ON THE MOSQUITOES OF LAKE
PROVIDENCE TO MAKE UP FOR IT 'THOSE LAKE PROVIDENCE COLOSSI AS HE
FINELY CALLED THEM
HE SAID THAT TWO OF THEM COULD WHIP A DOG AND THAT
FOUR OF THEM COULD HOLD A MAN DOWN AND EXCEPT HELP COME THEY WOULD
KILL HIM 'BUTCHER HIM AS HE EXPRESSED IT
REFERRED IN A SORT OF
CASUAL WAY AND YET SIGNIFICANT WAY TO 'THE FACT THAT THE LIFE POLICY
IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM IS UNKNOWN IN LAKE PROVIDENCE THEY TAKE OUT A
MOSQUITO POLICY BESIDES HE TOLD MANY REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT THOSE
LAWLESS INSECTS
AMONG OTHERS SAID HE HAD SEEN THEM TRY TO VOTE
NOTICING THAT THIS STATEMENT SEEMED TO BE A GOOD DEAL OF A STRAIN ON US
HE MODIFIED IT A LITTLE SAID HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN AS TO THAT
PARTICULAR BUT KNEW HE HAD SEEN THEM AROUND THE POLLS 'CANVASSING
THERE WAS ANOTHER PASSENGER FRIEND OF H 'S WHO BACKED UP THE HARSH
EVIDENCE AGAINST THOSE MOSQUITOES AND DETAILED SOME STIRRING ADVENTURES
WHICH HE HAD HAD WITH THEM
THE STORIES WERE PRETTY SIZABLE MERELY
PRETTY SIZABLE YET MR
H
WAS CONTINUALLY INTERRUPTING WITH A COLD
INEXORABLE 'WAIT KNOCK OFF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT
OF THAT NOW GO
ON OR 'WAIT YOU ARE GETTING THAT TOO STRONG CUT IT DOWN CUT IT
DOWN YOU GET A LEETLE TOO MUCH COSTUMERY ON TO YOUR STATEMENTS ALWAYS
DRESS A FACT IN TIGHTS NEVER IN AN ULSTER OR 'PARDON ONCE MORE IF
YOU ARE GOING TO LOAD ANYTHING MORE ON TO THAT STATEMENT YOU WANT TO
GET A COUPLE OF LIGHTERS AND TOW THE REST BECAUSE IT'S DRAWING ALL THE
WATER THERE IS IN THE RIVER ALREADY STICK TO FACTS JUST STICK TO
THE COLD FACTS WHAT THESE GENTLEMEN WANT FOR A BOOK IS THE FROZEN
TRUTH AIN'T THAT SO GENTLEMEN HE EXPLAINED PRIVATELY THAT IT WAS
NECESSARY TO WATCH THIS MAN ALL THE TIME AND KEEP HIM WITHIN BOUNDS
IT WOULD NOT DO TO NEGLECT THIS PRECAUTION AS HE MR
H 'KNEW TO HIS
SORROW SAID HE 'I WILL NOT DECEIVE YOU HE TOLD ME SUCH A MONSTROUS
LIE ONCE THAT IT SWELLED MY LEFT EAR UP AND SPREAD IT SO THAT I WAS
ACTUALLY NOT ABLE TO SEE OUT AROUND IT IT REMAINED SO FOR MONTHS AND
PEOPLE CAME MILES TO SEE ME FAN MYSELF WITH IT
CHAPTER 35
VICKSBURG DURING THE TROUBLE
WE USED TO PLOW PAST THE LOFTY HILL CITY VICKSBURG DOWN STREAM BUT
WE CANNOT DO THAT NOW
A CUT OFF HAS MADE A COUNTRY TOWN OF IT LIKE
OSCEOLA ST
GENEVIEVE AND SEVERAL OTHERS
THERE IS CURRENTLESS
WATER ALSO A BIG ISLAND IN FRONT OF VICKSBURG NOW
YOU COME DOWN THE
RIVER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND THEN TURN AND COME UP TO THE TOWN
THAT IS IN HIGH WATER IN LOW WATER YOU CAN'T COME UP BUT MUST LAND
SOME DISTANCE BELOW IT
SIGNS AND SCARS STILL REMAIN AS REMINDERS OF VICKSBURG'S TREMENDOUS
WAR EXPERIENCES EARTHWORKS TREES CRIPPLED BY THE CANNON BALLS
CAVE REFUGES IN THE CLAY PRECIPICES ETC
THE CAVES DID GOOD SERVICE
DURING THE SIX WEEKS' BOMBARDMENT OF THE CITY MAY 8 TO JULY 4 1863
THEY WERE USED BY THE NON COMBATANTS MAINLY BY THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
NOT TO LIVE IN CONSTANTLY BUT TO FLY TO FOR SAFETY ON OCCASION
THEY
WERE MERE HOLES TUNNELS DRIVEN INTO THE PERPENDICULAR CLAY BANK THEN
BRANCHED Y SHAPE WITHIN THE HILL
LIFE IN VICKSBURG DURING THE SIX
WEEKS WAS PERHAPS BUT WAIT HERE ARE SOME MATERIALS OUT OF WHICH TO
REPRODUCE IT
POPULATION TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SOLDIERS AND THREE THOUSAND
NON COMBATANTS THE CITY UTTERLY CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD WALLED SOLIDLY
IN THE FRONTAGE BY GUNBOATS THE REAR BY SOLDIERS AND BATTERIES
HENCE NO BUYING AND SELLING WITH THE OUTSIDE NO PASSING TO AND FRO
NO GOD SPEEDING A PARTING GUEST NO WELCOMING A COMING ONE NO PRINTED
ACRES OF WORLD WIDE NEWS TO BE READ AT BREAKFAST MORNINGS A TEDIOUS
DULL ABSENCE OF SUCH MATTER INSTEAD HENCE ALSO NO RUNNING TO SEE
STEAMBOATS SMOKING INTO VIEW IN THE DISTANCE UP OR DOWN AND PLOWING
TOWARD THE TOWN FOR NONE CAME THE RIVER LAY VACANT AND UNDISTURBED
NO RUSH AND TURMOIL AROUND THE RAILWAY STATION NO STRUGGLING OVER
BEWILDERED SWARMS OF PASSENGERS BY NOISY MOBS OF HACKMEN ALL QUIET
THERE FLOUR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A BARREL SUGAR THIRTY CORN TEN
DOLLARS A BUSHEL BACON FIVE DOLLARS A POUND RUM A HUNDRED DOLLARS A
GALLON OTHER THINGS IN PROPORTION CONSEQUENTLY NO ROAR AND RACKET OF
DRAYS AND CARRIAGES TEARING ALONG THE STREETS NOTHING FOR THEM TO
DO AMONG THAT HANDFUL OF NON COMBATANTS OF EXHAUSTED MEANS AT THREE
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING SILENCE SILENCE SO DEAD THAT THE MEASURED
TRAMP OF A SENTINEL CAN BE HEARD A SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE DISTANCE OUT OF
HEARING OF THIS LONELY SOUND PERHAPS THE STILLNESS IS ABSOLUTE ALL IN
A MOMENT COME GROUND SHAKING THUNDER CRASHES OF ARTILLERY THE SKY
IS COBWEBBED WITH THE CRISSCROSSING RED LINES STREAMING FROM SOARING
BOMB SHELLS AND A RAIN OF IRON FRAGMENTS DESCENDS UPON THE CITY
DESCENDS UPON THE EMPTY STREETS STREETS WHICH ARE NOT EMPTY A MOMENT
LATER BUT MOTTLED WITH DIM FIGURES OF FRANTIC WOMEN AND CHILDREN
SCURRYING FROM HOME AND BED TOWARD THE CAVE DUNGEONS ENCOURAGED BY THE
HUMOROUS GRIM SOLDIERY WHO SHOUT 'RATS TO YOUR HOLES AND LAUGH
THE CANNON THUNDER RAGES SHELLS SCREAM AND CRASH OVERHEAD THE IRON
RAIN POURS DOWN ONE HOUR TWO HOURS THREE POSSIBLY SIX THEN STOPS
SILENCE FOLLOWS BUT THE STREETS ARE STILL EMPTY THE SILENCE CONTINUES
BY AND BYE A HEAD PROJECTS FROM A CAVE HERE AND THERE AND YONDER AND
RECONNOITRES CAUTIOUSLY THE SILENCE STILL CONTINUING BODIES FOLLOW
HEADS AND JADED HALF SMOTHERED CREATURES GROUP THEMSELVES ABOUT
STRETCH THEIR CRAMPED LIMBS DRAW IN DEEP DRAUGHTS OF THE GRATEFUL FRESH
AIR GOSSIP WITH THE NEIGHBORS FROM THE NEXT CAVE MAYBE STRAGGLE OFF
HOME PRESENTLY OR TAKE A LOUNGE THROUGH THE TOWN IF THE STILLNESS
CONTINUES AND WILL SCURRY TO THE HOLES AGAIN BY AND BYE WHEN THE
WAR TEMPEST BREAKS FORTH ONCE MORE
THERE BEING BUT THREE THOUSAND OF THESE CAVE DWELLERS MERELY THE
POPULATION OF A VILLAGE WOULD THEY NOT COME TO KNOW EACH OTHER AFTER A
WEEK OR TWO AND FAMILIARLY INSOMUCH THAT THE FORTUNATE OR UNFORTUNATE
EXPERIENCES OF ONE WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO ALL
THOSE ARE THE MATERIALS FURNISHED BY HISTORY
FROM THEM MIGHT NOT ALMOST
ANYBODY REPRODUCE FOR HIMSELF THE LIFE OF THAT TIME IN VICKSBURG COULD
YOU WHO DID NOT EXPERIENCE IT COME NEARER TO REPRODUCING IT TO THE
IMAGINATION OF ANOTHER NON PARTICIPANT THAN COULD A VICKSBURGER WHO DID
EXPERIENCE IT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE AND YET THERE ARE REASONS WHY IT
MIGHT NOT REALLY BE
WHEN ONE MAKES HIS FIRST VOYAGE IN A SHIP IT IS
AN EXPERIENCE WHICH MULTITUDINOUSLY BRISTLES WITH STRIKING NOVELTIES
NOVELTIES WHICH ARE IN SUCH SHARP CONTRAST WITH ALL THIS PERSON'S
FORMER EXPERIENCES THAT THEY TAKE A SEEMINGLY DEATHLESS GRIP UPON HIS
IMAGINATION AND MEMORY
BY TONGUE OR PEN HE CAN MAKE A LANDSMAN LIVE
THAT STRANGE AND STIRRING VOYAGE OVER WITH HIM MAKE HIM SEE IT ALL AND
FEEL IT ALL
BUT IF HE WAIT IF HE MAKE TEN VOYAGES IN SUCCESSION WHAT
THEN WHY THE THING HAS LOST COLOR SNAP SURPRISE AND HAS BECOME
COMMONPLACE
THE MAN WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO TELL THAT WOULD QUICKEN A
LANDSMAN'S PULSE
YEARS AGO I TALKED WITH A COUPLE OF THE VICKSBURG NON COMBATANTS A MAN
AND HIS WIFE
LEFT TO TELL THEIR STORY IN THEIR OWN WAY THOSE PEOPLE
TOLD IT WITHOUT FIRE ALMOST WITHOUT INTEREST
A WEEK OF THEIR WONDERFUL LIFE THERE WOULD HAVE MADE THEIR TONGUES
ELOQUENT FOR EVER PERHAPS BUT THEY HAD SIX WEEKS OF IT AND THAT WORE
THE NOVELTY ALL OUT THEY GOT USED TO BEING BOMB SHELLED OUT OF HOME
AND INTO THE GROUND THE MATTER BECAME COMMONPLACE
AFTER THAT THE
POSSIBILITY OF THEIR EVER BEING STARTLINGLY INTERESTING IN THEIR TALKS
ABOUT IT WAS GONE
WHAT THE MAN SAID WAS TO THIS EFFECT
'IT GOT TO BE SUNDAY ALL THE TIME
SEVEN SUNDAYS IN THE WEEK TO US
ANYWAY
WE HADN'T ANYTHING TO DO AND TIME HUNG HEAVY
SEVEN SUNDAYS
AND ALL OF THEM BROKEN UP AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER IN THE DAY OR IN THE
NIGHT BY A FEW HOURS OF THE AWFUL STORM OF FIRE AND THUNDER AND IRON
AT FIRST WE USED TO SHIN FOR THE HOLES A GOOD DEAL FASTER THAN WE DID
AFTERWARDS
THE FIRST TIME I FORGOT THE CHILDREN AND MARIA FETCHED
THEM BOTH ALONG
WHEN SHE WAS ALL SAFE IN THE CAVE SHE FAINTED
TWO OR
THREE WEEKS AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE WAS RUNNING FOR THE HOLES ONE MORNING
THROUGH A SHELL SHOWER A BIG SHELL BURST NEAR HER AND COVERED HER ALL
OVER WITH DIRT AND A PIECE OF THE IRON CARRIED AWAY HER GAME BAG OF
FALSE HAIR FROM THE BACK OF HER HEAD
WELL SHE STOPPED TO GET THAT
GAME BAG BEFORE SHE SHOVED ALONG AGAIN WAS GETTING USED TO THINGS
ALREADY YOU SEE
WE ALL GOT SO THAT WE COULD TELL A GOOD DEAL ABOUT
SHELLS AND AFTER THAT WE DIDN'T ALWAYS GO UNDER SHELTER IF IT WAS A
LIGHT SHOWER
US MEN WOULD LOAF AROUND AND TALK AND A MAN WOULD SAY
'THERE SHE GOES AND NAME THE KIND OF SHELL IT WAS FROM THE SOUND OF
IT AND GO ON TALKING IF THERE WASN'T ANY DANGER FROM IT
IF A
SHELL WAS BURSTING CLOSE OVER US WE STOPPED TALKING AND STOOD
STILL UNCOMFORTABLE YES BUT IT WASN'T SAFE TO MOVE
WHEN IT LET
GO WE WENT ON TALKING AGAIN IF NOBODY HURT MAYBE SAYING 'THAT WAS A
RIPPER OR SOME SUCH COMMONPLACE COMMENT BEFORE WE RESUMED OR MAYBE
WE WOULD SEE A SHELL POISING ITSELF AWAY HIGH IN THE AIR OVERHEAD
IN THAT CASE EVERY FELLOW JUST WHIPPED OUT A SUDDEN 'SEE YOU AGAIN
GENTS AND SHOVED
OFTEN AND OFTEN I SAW GANGS OF LADIES PROMENADING
THE STREETS LOOKING AS CHEERFUL AS YOU PLEASE AND KEEPING AN EYE
CANTED UP WATCHING THE SHELLS AND I'VE SEEN THEM STOP STILL WHEN THEY
WERE UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT A SHELL WAS GOING TO DO AND WAIT AND MAKE
CERTAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY SA'NTERED ALONG AGAIN OR LIT OUT FOR
SHELTER ACCORDING TO THE VERDICT
STREETS IN SOME TOWNS HAVE A LITTER
OF PIECES OF PAPER AND ODDS AND ENDS OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER LYING
AROUND
OURS HADN'T THEY HAD IRON LITTER
SOMETIMES A MAN
WOULD GATHER UP ALL THE IRON FRAGMENTS AND UNBURSTED SHELLS IN HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD AND PILE THEM INTO A KIND OF MONUMENT IN HIS FRONT
YARD A TON OF IT SOMETIMES
NO GLASS LEFT GLASS COULDN'T STAND SUCH
A BOMBARDMENT IT WAS ALL SHIVERED OUT
WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES
VACANT LOOKED LIKE EYE HOLES IN A SKULL
WHOLE PANES WERE AS SCARCE
AS NEWS
'WE HAD CHURCH SUNDAYS
NOT MANY THERE ALONG AT FIRST BUT BY AND BYE
PRETTY GOOD TURNOUTS
I'VE SEEN SERVICE STOP A MINUTE AND EVERYBODY SIT
QUIET NO VOICE HEARD PRETTY FUNERAL LIKE THEN AND ALL THE MORE SO ON
ACCOUNT OF THE AWFUL BOOM AND CRASH GOING ON OUTSIDE AND OVERHEAD AND
PRETTY SOON WHEN A BODY COULD BE HEARD SERVICE WOULD GO ON AGAIN
ORGANS AND CHURCH MUSIC MIXED UP WITH A BOMBARDMENT IS A POWERFUL QUEER
COMBINATION ALONG AT FIRST
COMING OUT OF CHURCH ONE MORNING WE HAD
AN ACCIDENT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAPPENED AROUND ME ON A SUNDAY
I WAS
JUST HAVING A HEARTY HANDSHAKE WITH A FRIEND I HADN'T SEEN FOR A WHILE
AND SAYING 'DROP INTO OUR CAVE TO NIGHT AFTER BOMBARDMENT WE'VE GOT
HOLD OF A PINT OF PRIME WH WHISKEY I WAS GOING TO SAY YOU KNOW
BUT A SHELL INTERRUPTED
A CHUNK OF IT CUT THE MAN'S ARM OFF AND LEFT
IT DANGLING IN MY HAND
AND DO YOU KNOW THE THING THAT IS GOING TO STICK
THE LONGEST IN MY MEMORY AND OUTLAST EVERYTHING ELSE LITTLE AND BIG I
RECKON IS THE MEAN THOUGHT I HAD THEN IT WAS 'THE WHISKEY IS SAVED
AND YET DON'T YOU KNOW IT WAS KIND OF EXCUSABLE BECAUSE IT WAS AS
SCARCE AS DIAMONDS AND WE HAD ONLY JUST THAT LITTLE NEVER HAD ANOTHER
TASTE DURING THE SIEGE
'SOMETIMES THE CAVES WERE DESPERATELY CROWDED AND ALWAYS HOT AND CLOSE
SOMETIMES A CAVE HAD TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE PACKED INTO IT NO
TURNING ROOM FOR ANYBODY AIR SO FOUL SOMETIMES YOU COULDN'T HAVE MADE
A CANDLE BURN IN IT
A CHILD WAS BORN IN ONE OF THOSE CAVES ONE NIGHT
THINK OF THAT WHY IT WAS LIKE HAVING IT BORN IN A TRUNK
'TWICE WE HAD SIXTEEN PEOPLE IN OUR CAVE AND A NUMBER OF TIMES WE HAD A
DOZEN
PRETTY SUFFOCATING IN THERE
WE ALWAYS HAD EIGHT EIGHT BELONGED
THERE
HUNGER AND MISERY AND SICKNESS AND FRIGHT AND SORROW AND I
DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL GOT SO LOADED INTO THEM THAT NONE OF THEM WERE EVER
RIGHTLY THEIR OLD SELVES AFTER THE SIEGE
THEY ALL DIED BUT THREE OF US
WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS
ONE NIGHT A SHELL BURST IN FRONT OF THE HOLE
AND CAVED IT IN AND STOPPED IT UP
IT WAS LIVELY TIMES FOR A WHILE
DIGGING OUT
SOME OF US CAME NEAR SMOTHERING
AFTER THAT WE MADE TWO
OPENINGS OUGHT TO HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AT FIRST
'MULE MEAT
NO WE ONLY GOT DOWN TO THAT THE LAST DAY OR TWO
OF COURSE
IT WAS GOOD ANYTHING IS GOOD WHEN YOU ARE STARVING
THIS MAN HAD KEPT A DIARY DURING SIX WEEKS NO ONLY THE FIRST SIX
DAYS
THE FIRST DAY EIGHT CLOSE PAGES THE SECOND FIVE THE THIRD
ONE LOOSELY WRITTEN THE FOURTH THREE OR FOUR LINES A LINE OR TWO
THE FIFTH AND SIXTH DAYS SEVENTH DAY DIARY ABANDONED LIFE IN TERRIFIC
VICKSBURG HAVING NOW BECOME COMMONPLACE AND MATTER OF COURSE
THE WAR HISTORY OF VICKSBURG HAS MORE ABOUT IT TO INTEREST THE GENERAL
READER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE RIVER TOWNS
IT IS FULL OF VARIETY
FULL OF INCIDENT FULL OF THE PICTURESQUE
VICKSBURG HELD OUT LONGER
THAN ANY OTHER IMPORTANT RIVER TOWN AND SAW WARFARE IN ALL ITS PHASES
BOTH LAND AND WATER THE SIEGE THE MINE THE ASSAULT THE REPULSE THE
BOMBARDMENT SICKNESS CAPTIVITY FAMINE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL THE NATIONAL CEMETERIES IS HERE
OVER THE
GREAT GATEWAY IS THIS INSCRIPTION
HERE REST IN PEACE 16 600 WHO DIED FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE YEARS 1861
TO 1865
THE GROUNDS ARE NOBLY SITUATED BEING VERY HIGH AND COMMANDING A WIDE
PROSPECT OF LAND AND RIVER
THEY ARE TASTEFULLY LAID OUT IN BROAD
TERRACES WITH WINDING ROADS AND PATHS AND THERE IS PROFUSE ADORNMENT
IN THE WAY OF SEMI TROPICAL SHRUBS AND FLOWERS AND IN ONE PART IS A
PIECE OF NATIVE WILD WOOD LEFT JUST AS IT GREW AND THEREFORE PERFECT
IN ITS CHARM
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CEMETERY SUGGESTS THE HAND OF THE
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
THE GOVERNMENT'S WORK IS ALWAYS CONSPICUOUS FOR
EXCELLENCE SOLIDITY THOROUGHNESS NEATNESS
THE GOVERNMENT DOES ITS
WORK WELL IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THEN TAKES CARE OF IT
BY WINDING ROADS WHICH WERE OFTEN CUT TO SO GREAT A DEPTH BETWEEN
PERPENDICULAR WALLS THAT THEY WERE MERE ROOFLESS TUNNELS WE DROVE OUT A
MILE OR TWO AND VISITED THE MONUMENT WHICH STANDS UPON THE SCENE OF THE
SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG TO GENERAL GRANT BY GENERAL PEMBERTON
ITS METAL
WILL PRESERVE IT FROM THE HACKINGS AND CHIPPINGS WHICH SO DEFACED
ITS PREDECESSOR WHICH WAS OF MARBLE BUT THE BRICK FOUNDATIONS
ARE CRUMBLING AND IT WILL TUMBLE DOWN BY AND BYE
IT OVERLOOKS A
PICTURESQUE REGION OF WOODED HILLS AND RAVINES AND IS NOT UNPICTURESQUE
ITSELF BEING WELL SMOTHERED IN FLOWERING WEEDS
THE BATTERED REMNANT OF
THE MARBLE MONUMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED TO THE NATIONAL CEMETERY
ON THE ROAD A QUARTER OF A MILE TOWNWARD AN AGED COLORED MAN SHOWED
US WITH PRIDE AN UNEXPLODED BOMB SHELL WHICH HAS LAIN IN HIS YARD
SINCE THE DAY IT FELL THERE DURING THE SIEGE
'I WAS A STANNIN' HEAH AN' DE DOG WAS A STANNIN' HEAH DE DOG HE WENT
FOR DE SHELL GWINE TO PICK A FUSS WID IT BUT I DIDN'T I SAYS JES'
MAKE YOU'SEFF AT HOME HEAH LAY STILL WHAH YOU IS OR BUST UP DE PLACE
JES' AS YOU'S A MIND TO BUT I'S GOT BUSINESS OUT IN DE WOODS I HAS
VICKSBURG IS A TOWN OF SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS STREETS AND PLEASANT
RESIDENCES IT COMMANDS THE COMMERCE OF THE YAZOO AND SUNFLOWER RIVERS
IS PUSHING RAILWAYS IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS THROUGH RICH AGRICULTURAL
REGIONS AND HAS A PROMISING FUTURE OF PROSPERITY AND IMPORTANCE
APPARENTLY NEARLY ALL THE RIVER TOWNS BIG AND LITTLE HAVE MADE UP
THEIR MINDS THAT THEY MUST LOOK MAINLY TO RAILROADS FOR WEALTH AND
UPBUILDING HENCEFORTH
THEY ARE ACTING UPON THIS IDEA
THE SIGNS ARE
THAT THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS WILL BRING ABOUT SOME NOTEWORTHY CHANGES IN
THE VALLEY IN THE DIRECTION OF INCREASED POPULATION AND WEALTH AND IN
THE INTELLECTUAL ADVANCEMENT AND THE LIBERALIZING OF OPINION WHICH GO
NATURALLY WITH THESE
AND YET IF ONE MAY JUDGE BY THE PAST THE RIVER
TOWNS WILL MANAGE TO FIND AND USE A CHANCE HERE AND THERE TO CRIPPLE
AND RETARD THEIR PROGRESS
THEY KEPT THEMSELVES BACK IN THE DAYS OF
STEAMBOATING SUPREMACY BY A SYSTEM OF WHARFAGE DUES SO STUPIDLY GRADED
AS TO PROHIBIT WHAT MAY BE CALLED SMALL RETAIL TRAFFIC IN FREIGHTS AND
PASSENGERS
BOATS WERE CHARGED SUCH HEAVY WHARFAGE THAT THEY COULD NOT
AFFORD TO LAND FOR ONE OR TWO PASSENGERS OR A LIGHT LOT OF FREIGHT
INSTEAD OF ENCOURAGING THE BRINGING OF TRADE TO THEIR DOORS THE TOWNS
DILIGENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY DISCOURAGED IT
THEY COULD HAVE HAD MANY
BOATS AND LOW RATES BUT THEIR POLICY RENDERED FEW BOATS AND HIGH
RATES COMPULSORY
IT WAS A POLICY WHICH EXTENDED AND EXTENDS FROM NEW
ORLEANS TO ST
PAUL
WE HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO MAKE A TRIP UP THE YAZOO AND THE SUNFLOWER AN
INTERESTING REGION AT ANY TIME BUT ADDITIONALLY INTERESTING AT THIS
TIME BECAUSE UP THERE THE GREAT INUNDATION WAS STILL TO BE SEEN IN
FORCE BUT WE WERE NEARLY SURE TO HAVE TO WAIT A DAY OR MORE FOR A NEW
ORLEANS BOAT ON OUR RETURN SO WE WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE PROJECT
HERE IS A STORY WHICH I PICKED UP ON BOARD THE BOAT THAT NIGHT
I INSERT
IT IN THIS PLACE MERELY BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD STORY NOT BECAUSE IT
BELONGS HERE FOR IT DOESN'T
IT WAS TOLD BY A PASSENGER A COLLEGE
PROFESSOR AND WAS CALLED TO THE SURFACE IN THE COURSE OF A GENERAL
CONVERSATION WHICH BEGAN WITH TALK ABOUT HORSES DRIFTED INTO TALK
ABOUT ASTRONOMY THEN INTO TALK ABOUT THE LYNCHING OF THE GAMBLERS
IN VICKSBURG HALF A CENTURY AGO THEN INTO TALK ABOUT DREAMS AND
SUPERSTITIONS AND ENDED AFTER MIDNIGHT IN A DISPUTE OVER FREE TRADE
AND PROTECTION
CHAPTER 36
THE PROFESSOR'S YARN
IT WAS IN THE EARLY DAYS
I WAS NOT A COLLEGE PROFESSOR THEN
I WAS A
HUMBLE MINDED YOUNG LAND SURVEYOR WITH THE WORLD BEFORE ME TO SURVEY
IN CASE ANYBODY WANTED IT DONE
I HAD A CONTRACT TO SURVEY A ROUTE FOR A
GREAT MINING DITCH IN CALIFORNIA AND I WAS ON MY WAY THITHER BY SEA A
THREE OR FOUR WEEKS' VOYAGE
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY PASSENGERS BUT I
HAD VERY LITTLE TO SAY TO THEM READING AND DREAMING WERE MY PASSIONS
AND I AVOIDED CONVERSATION IN ORDER TO INDULGE THESE APPETITES
THERE
WERE THREE PROFESSIONAL GAMBLERS ON BOARD ROUGH REPULSIVE FELLOWS
I
NEVER HAD ANY TALK WITH THEM YET I COULD NOT HELP SEEING THEM WITH SOME
FREQUENCY FOR THEY GAMBLED IN AN UPPER DECK STATEROOM EVERY DAY AND
NIGHT AND IN MY PROMENADES I OFTEN HAD GLIMPSES OF THEM THROUGH THEIR
DOOR WHICH STOOD A LITTLE AJAR TO LET OUT THE SURPLUS TOBACCO SMOKE AND
PROFANITY
THEY WERE AN EVIL AND HATEFUL PRESENCE BUT I HAD TO PUT UP
WITH IT OF COURSE
THERE WAS ONE OTHER PASSENGER WHO FELL UNDER MY EYE A GOOD DEAL FOR HE
SEEMED DETERMINED TO BE FRIENDLY WITH ME AND I COULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN
RID OF HIM WITHOUT RUNNING SOME CHANCE OF HURTING HIS FEELINGS AND I
WAS FAR FROM WISHING TO DO THAT
BESIDES THERE WAS SOMETHING ENGAGING
IN HIS COUNTRIFIED SIMPLICITY AND HIS BEAMING GOOD NATURE
THE FIRST
TIME I SAW THIS MR
JOHN BACKUS I GUESSED FROM HIS CLOTHES AND HIS
LOOKS THAT HE WAS A GRAZIER OR FARMER FROM THE BACKWOODS OF SOME
WESTERN STATE DOUBTLESS OHIO AND AFTERWARD WHEN HE DROPPED INTO HIS
PERSONAL HISTORY AND I DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS A CATTLE RAISER FROM
INTERIOR OHIO I WAS SO PLEASED WITH MY OWN PENETRATION THAT I WARMED
TOWARD HIM FOR VERIFYING MY INSTINCT
HE GOT TO DROPPING ALONGSIDE ME EVERY DAY AFTER BREAKFAST TO HELP ME
MAKE MY PROMENADE AND SO IN THE COURSE OF TIME HIS EASY WORKING JAW
HAD TOLD ME EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS BUSINESS HIS PROSPECTS HIS FAMILY
HIS RELATIVES HIS POLITICS IN FACT EVERYTHING THAT CONCERNED A BACKUS
LIVING OR DEAD
AND MEANTIME I THINK HE HAD MANAGED TO GET OUT OF ME
EVERYTHING I KNEW ABOUT MY TRADE MY TRIBE MY PURPOSES MY PROSPECTS
AND MYSELF
HE WAS A GENTLE AND PERSUASIVE GENIUS AND THIS THING SHOWED
IT FOR I WAS NOT GIVEN TO TALKING ABOUT MY MATTERS
I SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT TRIANGULATION ONCE THE STATELY WORD PLEASED HIS EAR HE INQUIRED
WHAT IT MEANT I EXPLAINED AFTER THAT HE QUIETLY AND INOFFENSIVELY
IGNORED MY NAME AND ALWAYS CALLED ME TRIANGLE
WHAT AN ENTHUSIAST HE WAS IN CATTLE AT THE BARE NAME OF A BULL OR
A COW HIS EYE WOULD LIGHT AND HIS ELOQUENT TONGUE WOULD TURN ITSELF
LOOSE
AS LONG AS I WOULD WALK AND LISTEN HE WOULD WALK AND TALK HE
KNEW ALL BREEDS HE LOVED ALL BREEDS HE CARESSED THEM ALL WITH HIS
AFFECTIONATE TONGUE
I TRAMPED ALONG IN VOICELESS MISERY WHILST THE
CATTLE QUESTION WAS UP WHEN I COULD ENDURE IT NO LONGER I USED TO
DEFTLY INSERT A SCIENTIFIC TOPIC INTO THE CONVERSATION THEN MY EYE
FIRED AND HIS FADED MY TONGUE FLUTTERED HIS STOPPED LIFE WAS A JOY TO
ME AND A SADNESS TO HIM
ONE DAY HE SAID A LITTLE HESITATINGLY AND WITH SOMEWHAT OF
DIFFIDENCE
'TRIANGLE WOULD YOU MIND COMING DOWN TO MY STATEROOM A MINUTE AND HAVE
A LITTLE TALK ON A CERTAIN MATTER
I WENT WITH HIM AT ONCE
ARRIVED THERE HE PUT HIS HEAD OUT GLANCED UP
AND DOWN THE SALOON WARILY THEN CLOSED THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT
HE SAT
DOWN ON THE SOFA AND HE SAID
'I'M A GOING TO MAKE A LITTLE PROPOSITION TO YOU AND IF IT STRIKES
YOU FAVORABLE IT'LL BE A MIDDLING GOOD THING FOR BOTH OF US
YOU AIN'T
A GOING OUT TO CALIFORNY FOR FUN NUTHER AM I IT'S BUSINESS AIN'T THAT
SO WELL YOU CAN DO ME A GOOD TURN AND SO CAN I YOU IF WE SEE FIT
I'VE RAKED AND SCRAPED AND SAVED A CONSIDERABLE MANY YEARS AND I'VE
GOT IT ALL HERE HE UNLOCKED AN OLD HAIR TRUNK TUMBLED A CHAOS OF
SHABBY CLOTHES ASIDE AND DREW A SHORT STOUT BAG INTO VIEW FOR A MOMENT
THEN BURIED IT AGAIN AND RELOCKED THE TRUNK
DROPPING HIS VOICE TO A
CAUTIOUS LOW TONE HE CONTINUED 'SHE'S ALL THERE A ROUND TEN THOUSAND
DOLLARS IN YELLOW BOYS NOW THIS IS MY LITTLE IDEA WHAT I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT RAISING CATTLE AIN'T WORTH KNOWING
THERE'S MINTS OF MONEY IN IT
IN CALIFORNY
WELL I KNOW AND YOU KNOW THAT ALL ALONG A LINE THAT
'S BEING SURVEYED THERE 'S LITTLE DABS OF LAND THAT THEY CALL GORES
THAT FALL TO THE SURVEYOR FREE GRATIS FOR NOTHING
ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO
ON YOUR SIDE IS TO SURVEY IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE GORES WILL FALL ON
GOOD FAT LAND THEN YOU TURN 'EM OVER TO ME I STOCK 'EM WITH CATTLE
IN ROLLS THE CASH I PLANK OUT YOUR SHARE OF THE DOLLARS REGULAR RIGHT
ALONG AND
I WAS SORRY TO WITHER HIS BLOOMING ENTHUSIASM BUT IT COULD NOT BE
HELPED
I INTERRUPTED AND SAID SEVERELY
'I AM NOT THAT KIND OF A SURVEYOR
LET US CHANGE THE SUBJECT MR
BACKUS
IT WAS PITIFUL TO SEE HIS CONFUSION AND HEAR HIS AWKWARD AND SHAMEFACED
APOLOGIES
I WAS AS MUCH DISTRESSED AS HE WAS ESPECIALLY AS HE SEEMED
SO FAR FROM HAVING SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING IMPROPER IN HIS
PROPOSITION
SO I HASTENED TO CONSOLE HIM AND LEAD HIM ON TO FORGET HIS
MISHAP IN A CONVERSATIONAL ORGY ABOUT CATTLE AND BUTCHERY
WE WERE LYING
AT ACAPULCO AND AS WE WENT ON DECK IT HAPPENED LUCKILY THAT THE CREW
WERE JUST BEGINNING TO HOIST SOME BEEVES ABOARD IN SLINGS
BACKUS'S
MELANCHOLY VANISHED INSTANTLY AND WITH IT THE MEMORY OF HIS LATE
MISTAKE
'NOW ONLY LOOK AT THAT CRIED HE 'MY GOODNESS TRIANGLE WHAT WOULD
THEY SAY TO IT IN OHIO
WOULDN'T THEIR EYES BUG OUT TO SEE 'EM
HANDLED LIKE THAT WOULDN'T THEY THOUGH
ALL THE PASSENGERS WERE ON DECK TO LOOK EVEN THE GAMBLERS AND BACKUS
KNEW THEM ALL AND HAD AFFLICTED THEM ALL WITH HIS PET TOPIC
AS I MOVED
AWAY I SAW ONE OF THE GAMBLERS APPROACH AND ACCOST HIM THEN ANOTHER
OF THEM THEN THE THIRD
I HALTED WAITED WATCHED THE CONVERSATION
CONTINUED BETWEEN THE FOUR MEN IT GREW EARNEST BACKUS DREW GRADUALLY
AWAY THE GAMBLERS FOLLOWED AND KEPT AT HIS ELBOW
I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
HOWEVER AS THEY PASSED ME PRESENTLY I HEARD BACKUS SAY WITH A TONE OF
PERSECUTED ANNOYANCE
'BUT IT AIN'T ANY USE GENTLEMEN I TELL YOU AGAIN AS I'VE TOLD YOU A
HALF A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE I WARN'T RAISED TO IT AND I AIN'T A GOING TO
RESK IT
I FELT RELIEVED
'HIS LEVEL HEAD WILL BE HIS SUFFICIENT PROTECTION I
SAID TO MYSELF
DURING THE FORTNIGHT'S RUN FROM ACAPULCO TO SAN FRANCISCO I SEVERAL
TIMES SAW THE GAMBLERS TALKING EARNESTLY WITH BACKUS AND ONCE I THREW
OUT A GENTLE WARNING TO HIM
HE CHUCKLED COMFORTABLY AND SAID
'OH YES THEY TAG AROUND AFTER ME CONSIDERABLE WANT ME TO PLAY A
LITTLE JUST FOR AMUSEMENT THEY SAY BUT LAWS A ME IF MY FOLKS HAVE
TOLD ME ONCE TO LOOK OUT FOR THAT SORT OF LIVE STOCK THEY'VE TOLD ME A
THOUSAND TIMES I RECKON
BY AND BYE IN DUE COURSE WE WERE APPROACHING SAN FRANCISCO
IT WAS
AN UGLY BLACK NIGHT WITH A STRONG WIND BLOWING BUT THERE WAS NOT MUCH
SEA
I WAS ON DECK ALONE
TOWARD TEN I STARTED BELOW
A FIGURE ISSUED
FROM THE GAMBLERS' DEN AND DISAPPEARED IN THE DARKNESS
I EXPERIENCED
A SHOCK FOR I WAS SURE IT WAS BACKUS
I FLEW DOWN THE COMPANION WAY
LOOKED ABOUT FOR HIM COULD NOT FIND HIM THEN RETURNED TO THE DECK JUST
IN TIME TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM AS HE RE ENTERED THAT CONFOUNDED NEST
OF RASCALITY
HAD HE YIELDED AT LAST I FEARED IT
WHAT HAD HE GONE
BELOW FOR HIS BAG OF COIN POSSIBLY
I DREW NEAR THE DOOR FULL OF
BODINGS
IT WAS A CRACK AND I GLANCED IN AND SAW A SIGHT THAT MADE ME
BITTERLY WISH I HAD GIVEN MY ATTENTION TO SAVING MY POOR CATTLE FRIEND
INSTEAD OF READING AND DREAMING MY FOOLISH TIME AWAY
HE WAS GAMBLING
WORSE STILL HE WAS BEING PLIED WITH CHAMPAGNE AND WAS ALREADY SHOWING
SOME EFFECT FROM IT
HE PRAISED THE 'CIDER AS HE CALLED IT AND SAID
NOW THAT HE HAD GOT A TASTE OF IT HE ALMOST BELIEVED HE WOULD DRINK IT
IF IT WAS SPIRITS IT WAS SO GOOD AND SO AHEAD OF ANYTHING HE HAD EVER
RUN ACROSS BEFORE
SURREPTITIOUS SMILES AT THIS PASSED FROM ONE RASCAL
TO ANOTHER AND THEY FILLED ALL THE GLASSES AND WHILST BACKUS HONESTLY
DRAINED HIS TO THE BOTTOM THEY PRETENDED TO DO THE SAME BUT THREW THE
WINE OVER THEIR SHOULDERS
I COULD NOT BEAR THE SCENE SO I WANDERED FORWARD AND TRIED TO INTEREST
MYSELF IN THE SEA AND THE VOICES OF THE WIND
BUT NO MY UNEASY SPIRIT
KEPT DRAGGING ME BACK AT QUARTER HOUR INTERVALS AND ALWAYS I SAW BACKUS
DRINKING HIS WINE FAIRLY AND SQUARELY AND THE OTHERS THROWING THEIRS
AWAY
IT WAS THE PAINFULLEST NIGHT I EVER SPENT
THE ONLY HOPE I HAD WAS THAT WE MIGHT REACH OUR ANCHORAGE WITH
SPEED THAT WOULD BREAK UP THE GAME
I HELPED THE SHIP ALONG ALL I COULD
WITH MY PRAYERS
AT LAST WE WENT BOOMING THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE AND MY
PULSES LEAPED FOR JOY
I HURRIED BACK TO THAT DOOR AND GLANCED IN
ALAS
THERE WAS SMALL ROOM FOR HOPE BACKUS'S EYES WERE HEAVY AND BLOODSHOT
HIS SWEATY FACE WAS CRIMSON HIS SPEECH MAUDLIN AND THICK HIS BODY
SAWED DRUNKENLY ABOUT WITH THE WEAVING MOTION OF THE SHIP
HE DRAINED
ANOTHER GLASS TO THE DREGS WHILST THE CARDS WERE BEING DEALT
HE TOOK HIS HAND GLANCED AT IT AND HIS DULL EYES LIT UP FOR A MOMENT
THE GAMBLERS OBSERVED IT AND SHOWED THEIR GRATIFICATION BY HARDLY
PERCEPTIBLE SIGNS
'HOW MANY CARDS
'NONE SAID BACKUS
ONE VILLAIN NAMED HANK WILEY DISCARDED ONE CARD THE OTHERS THREE
EACH
THE BETTING BEGAN
HERETOFORE THE BETS HAD BEEN TRIFLING A DOLLAR
OR TWO BUT BACKUS STARTED OFF WITH AN EAGLE NOW WILEY HESITATED A
MOMENT THEN 'SAW IT' AND 'WENT TEN DOLLARS BETTER THE OTHER TWO THREW
UP THEIR HANDS
BACKUS WENT TWENTY BETTER
WILEY SAID
'I SEE THAT AND GO YOU A HUNDRED BETTER THEN SMILED AND REACHED FOR
THE MONEY
'LET IT ALONE SAID BACKUS WITH DRUNKEN GRAVITY
'WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO COVER IT
'COVER IT WELL I RECKON I AM AND LAY ANOTHER HUNDRED ON TOP OF IT
TOO
HE REACHED DOWN INSIDE HIS OVERCOAT AND PRODUCED THE REQUIRED SUM
'OH THAT'S YOUR LITTLE GAME IS IT I SEE YOUR RAISE AND RAISE IT FIVE
HUNDRED SAID WILEY
'FIVE HUNDRED BETTER SAID THE FOOLISH BULL DRIVER AND PULLED OUT THE
AMOUNT AND SHOWERED IT ON THE PILE
THE THREE CONSPIRATORS HARDLY TRIED
TO CONCEAL THEIR EXULTATION
ALL DIPLOMACY AND PRETENSE WERE DROPPED NOW AND THE SHARP EXCLAMATIONS
CAME THICK AND FAST AND THE YELLOW PYRAMID GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER
AT
LAST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LAY IN VIEW
WILEY CAST A BAG OF COIN ON THE
TABLE AND SAID WITH MOCKING GENTLENESS
'FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BETTER MY FRIEND FROM THE RURAL DISTRICTS WHAT
DO YOU SAY NOW
'I CALL YOU SAID BACKUS HEAVING HIS GOLDEN SHOT BAG ON THE PILE
'WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
'FOUR KINGS YOU D D FOOL AND WILEY THREW DOWN HIS CARDS AND
SURROUNDED THE STAKES WITH HIS ARMS
'FOUR ACES YOU ASS THUNDERED BACKUS COVERING HIS MAN WITH A COCKED
REVOLVER I'M A PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER MYSELF AND I'VE BEEN LAYING FOR
YOU DUFFERS ALL THIS VOYAGE
DOWN WENT THE ANCHOR RUMBLEDY DUM DUM AND THE LONG TRIP WAS ENDED
WELL WELL IT IS A SAD WORLD
ONE OF THE THREE GAMBLERS WAS BACKUS'S
'PAL IT WAS HE THAT DEALT THE FATEFUL HANDS
ACCORDING TO AN
UNDERSTANDING WITH THE TWO VICTIMS HE WAS TO HAVE GIVEN BACKUS FOUR
QUEENS BUT ALAS HE DIDN'T
A WEEK LATER I STUMBLED UPON BACKUS ARRAYED IN THE HEIGHT OF
FASHION IN MONTGOMERY STREET
HE SAID CHEERILY AS WE WERE PARTING
'AH BY THE WAY YOU NEEDN'T MIND ABOUT THOSE GORES
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT CATTLE EXCEPT WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP IN A WEEK'S
APPRENTICESHIP OVER IN JERSEY JUST BEFORE WE SAILED
MY CATTLE CULTURE
AND CATTLE ENTHUSIASM HAVE SERVED THEIR TURN I SHAN'T NEED THEM ANY
MORE
NEXT DAY WE RELUCTANTLY PARTED FROM THE 'GOLD DUST' AND HER OFFICERS
HOPING TO SEE THAT BOAT AND ALL THOSE OFFICERS AGAIN SOME DAY
A THING
WHICH THE FATES WERE TO RENDER TRAGICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
CHAPTER 37
THE END OF THE 'GOLD DUST'
FOR THREE MONTHS LATER AUGUST 8 WHILE I WAS WRITING ONE OF THESE
FOREGOING CHAPTERS THE NEW YORK PAPERS BROUGHT THIS TELEGRAM
A TERRIBLE DISASTER
SEVENTEEN PERSONS KILLED BY AN EXPLOSION ON THE STEAMER 'GOLD DUST
'NASHVILLE AUG
7 A DESPATCH FROM HICKMAN KY SAYS
'THE STEAMER GOLD DUST EXPLODED HER BOILERS AT THREE O'CLOCK TO DAY
JUST AFTER LEAVING HICKMAN
FORTY SEVEN PERSONS WERE SCALDED AND
SEVENTEEN ARE MISSING
THE BOAT WAS LANDED IN THE EDDY JUST ABOVE THE
TOWN AND THROUGH THE EXERTIONS OF THE CITIZENS THE CABIN PASSENGERS
OFFICERS AND PART OF THE CREW AND DECK PASSENGERS WERE TAKEN ASHORE AND
REMOVED TO THE HOTELS AND RESIDENCES
TWENTY FOUR OF THE INJURED WERE
LYING IN HOLCOMB'S DRY GOODS STORE AT ONE TIME WHERE THEY RECEIVED
EVERY ATTENTION BEFORE BEING REMOVED TO MORE COMFORTABLE PLACES
A LIST OF THE NAMES FOLLOWED WHEREBY IT APPEARED THAT OF THE SEVENTEEN
DEAD ONE WAS THE BARKEEPER AND AMONG THE FORTY SEVEN WOUNDED WERE THE
CAPTAIN CHIEF MATE SECOND MATE AND SECOND AND THIRD CLERKS ALSO MR
LEM S
GRAY PILOT AND SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE CREW
IN ANSWER TO A PRIVATE TELEGRAM WE LEARNED THAT NONE OF THESE WAS
SEVERELY HURT EXCEPT MR
GRAY
LETTERS RECEIVED AFTERWARD CONFIRMED
THIS NEWS AND SAID THAT MR
GRAY WAS IMPROVING AND WOULD GET WELL
LATER LETTERS SPOKE LESS HOPEFULLY OF HIS CASE AND FINALLY CAME ONE
ANNOUNCING HIS DEATH
A GOOD MAN A MOST COMPANIONABLE AND MANLY MAN
AND WORTHY OF A KINDLIER FATE
CHAPTER 38
THE HOUSE BEAUTIFUL
WE TOOK PASSAGE IN A CINCINNATI BOAT FOR NEW ORLEANS OR ON A CINCINNATI
BOAT EITHER IS CORRECT THE FORMER IS THE EASTERN FORM OF PUTTING IT
THE LATTER THE WESTERN
MR
DICKENS DECLINED TO AGREE THAT THE MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOATS WERE
'MAGNIFICENT OR THAT THEY WERE 'FLOATING PALACES TERMS WHICH
HAD ALWAYS BEEN APPLIED TO THEM TERMS WHICH DID NOT OVER EXPRESS THE
ADMIRATION WITH WHICH THE PEOPLE VIEWED THEM
MR
DICKENS'S POSITION WAS UNASSAILABLE POSSIBLY THE PEOPLE'S POSITION
WAS CERTAINLY UNASSAILABLE
IF MR
DICKENS WAS COMPARING THESE BOATS
WITH THE CROWN JEWELS OR WITH THE TAJ OR WITH THE MATTERHORN OR WITH
SOME OTHER PRICELESS OR WONDERFUL THING WHICH HE HAD SEEN THEY WERE NOT
MAGNIFICENT HE WAS RIGHT
THE PEOPLE COMPARED THEM WITH WHAT THEY HAD
SEEN AND THUS MEASURED THUS JUDGED THE BOATS WERE MAGNIFICENT THE
TERM WAS THE CORRECT ONE IT WAS NOT AT ALL TOO STRONG
THE PEOPLE WERE
AS RIGHT AS WAS MR
DICKENS
THE STEAMBOATS WERE FINER THAN ANYTHING ON
SHORE
COMPARED WITH SUPERIOR DWELLING HOUSES AND FIRST CLASS HOTELS IN
THE VALLEY THEY WERE INDUBITABLY MAGNIFICENT THEY WERE 'PALACES TO
A FEW PEOPLE LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS AND ST

MAGNIFICENT PERHAPS NOT PALACES BUT TO THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE
POPULATIONS AND TO THE ENTIRE POPULATIONS SPREAD OVER BOTH BANKS

CHAPTER 39
MANUFACTURES AND MISCREANTS
WHERE THE RIVER IN THE VICKSBURG REGION USED TO BE CORKSCREWED IT
IS NOW COMPARATIVELY STRAIGHT MADE SO BY CUT OFF A FORMER DISTANCE
OF SEVENTY MILES IS REDUCED TO THIRTY FIVE
IT IS A CHANGE WHICH THREW
VICKSBURG'S NEIGHBOR DELTA LOUISIANA OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND ENDED
ITS CAREER AS A RIVER TOWN
ITS WHOLE RIVER FRONTAGE IS NOW OCCUPIED BY
A VAST SAND BAR THICKLY COVERED WITH YOUNG TREES A GROWTH WHICH WILL
MAGNIFY ITSELF INTO A DENSE FOREST BY AND BYE AND COMPLETELY HIDE THE
EXILED TOWN
IN DUE TIME WE PASSED GRAND GULF AND RODNEY OF WAR FAME AND REACHED
NATCHEZ THE LAST OF THE BEAUTIFUL HILL CITIES FOR BATON ROUGE YET
TO COME IS NOT ON A HILL BUT ONLY ON HIGH GROUND
FAMOUS
NATCHEZ UNDER THE HILL HAS NOT CHANGED NOTABLY IN TWENTY YEARS IN
OUTWARD ASPECT JUDGING BY THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ANCIENT PROCESSION
OF FOREIGN TOURISTS IT HAS NOT CHANGED IN SIXTY FOR IT IS STILL SMALL
STRAGGLING AND SHABBY
IT HAD A DESPERATE REPUTATION MORALLY IN
THE OLD KEEL BOATING AND EARLY STEAMBOATING TIMES PLENTY OF DRINKING
CAROUSING FISTICUFFING AND KILLING THERE AMONG THE RIFF RAFF OF THE
RIVER IN THOSE DAYS
BUT NATCHEZ ON TOP OF THE HILL IS ATTRACTIVE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN ATTRACTIVE
EVEN MRS
TROLLOPE 1827 HAD TO CONFESS ITS
CHARMS
'AT ONE OR TWO POINTS THE WEARISOME LEVEL LINE IS RELIEVED BY BLUFFS
AS THEY CALL THE SHORT INTERVALS OF HIGH GROUND
THE TOWN OF NATCHEZ IS
BEAUTIFULLY SITUATED ON ONE OF THOSE HIGH SPOTS
THE CONTRAST THAT
ITS BRIGHT GREEN HILL FORMS WITH THE DISMAL LINE OF BLACK FOREST THAT
STRETCHES ON EVERY SIDE THE ABUNDANT GROWTH OF THE PAWPAW PALMETTO
AND ORANGE THE COPIOUS VARIETY OF SWEET SCENTED FLOWERS THAT FLOURISH
THERE ALL MAKE IT APPEAR LIKE AN OASIS IN THE DESERT
NATCHEZ IS THE
FURTHEST POINT TO THE NORTH AT WHICH ORANGES RIPEN IN THE OPEN AIR
OR ENDURE THE WINTER WITHOUT SHELTER
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS
SWEET SPOT I THOUGHT ALL THE LITTLE TOWNS AND VILLAGES WE PASSED
WRETCHED LOOKING IN THE EXTREME
NATCHEZ LIKE HER NEAR AND FAR RIVER NEIGHBORS HAS RAILWAYS NOW AND IS
ADDING TO THEM PUSHING THEM HITHER AND THITHER INTO ALL RICH OUTLYING
REGIONS THAT ARE NATURALLY TRIBUTARY TO HER
AND LIKE VICKSBURG AND NEW
ORLEANS SHE HAS HER ICE FACTORY SHE MAKES THIRTY TONS OF ICE A DAY
IN VICKSBURG AND NATCHEZ IN MY TIME ICE WAS JEWELRY NONE BUT THE RICH
COULD WEAR IT
BUT ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY CAN HAVE IT NOW
I VISITED ONE
OF THE ICE FACTORIES IN NEW ORLEANS TO SEE WHAT THE POLAR REGIONS
MIGHT LOOK LIKE WHEN LUGGED INTO THE EDGE OF THE TROPICS
BUT THERE WAS
NOTHING STRIKING IN THE ASPECT OF THE PLACE
IT WAS MERELY A SPACIOUS
HOUSE WITH SOME INNOCENT STEAM MACHINERY IN ONE END OF IT AND SOME BIG
PORCELAIN PIPES RUNNING HERE AND THERE
NO NOT PORCELAIN THEY MERELY
SEEMED TO BE THEY WERE IRON BUT THE AMMONIA WHICH WAS BEING BREATHED
THROUGH THEM HAD COATED THEM TO THE THICKNESS OF YOUR HAND WITH SOLID
MILK WHITE ICE
IT OUGHT TO HAVE MELTED FOR ONE DID NOT REQUIRE WINTER
CLOTHING IN THAT ATMOSPHERE BUT IT DID NOT MELT THE INSIDE OF THE PIPE
WAS TOO COLD
SUNK INTO THE FLOOR WERE NUMBERLESS TIN BOXES A FOOT SQUARE AND TWO
FEET LONG AND OPEN AT THE TOP END
THESE WERE FULL OF CLEAR WATER
AND AROUND EACH BOX SALT AND OTHER PROPER STUFF WAS PACKED ALSO THE
AMMONIA GASES WERE APPLIED TO THE WATER IN SOME WAY WHICH WILL ALWAYS
REMAIN A SECRET TO ME BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS
WHILE THE WATER IN THE BOXES GRADUALLY FROZE MEN GAVE IT A STIR OR TWO
WITH A STICK OCCASIONALLY TO LIBERATE THE AIR BUBBLES I THINK
OTHER
MEN WERE CONTINUALLY LIFTING OUT BOXES WHOSE CONTENTS HAD BECOME HARD
FROZEN
THEY GAVE THE BOX A SINGLE DIP INTO A VAT OF BOILING WATER TO
MELT THE BLOCK OF ICE FREE FROM ITS TIN COFFIN THEN THEY SHOT THE BLOCK
OUT UPON A PLATFORM CAR AND IT WAS READY FOR MARKET
THESE BIG BLOCKS
WERE HARD SOLID AND CRYSTAL CLEAR
IN CERTAIN OF THEM BIG BOUQUETS
OF FRESH AND BRILLIANT TROPICAL FLOWERS HAD BEEN FROZEN IN IN OTHERS
BEAUTIFUL SILKEN CLAD FRENCH DOLLS AND OTHER PRETTY OBJECTS
THESE BLOCKS WERE TO BE SET ON END IN A PLATTER IN THE CENTER OF
DINNER TABLES TO COOL THE TROPICAL AIR AND ALSO TO BE ORNAMENTAL FOR
THE FLOWERS AND THINGS IMPRISONED IN THEM COULD BE SEEN AS THROUGH PLATE
GLASS
I WAS TOLD THAT THIS FACTORY COULD RETAIL ITS ICE BY WAGON
THROUGHOUT NEW ORLEANS IN THE HUMBLEST DWELLING HOUSE QUANTITIES AT
SIX OR SEVEN DOLLARS A TON AND MAKE A SUFFICIENT PROFIT
THIS BEING THE
CASE THERE IS BUSINESS FOR ICE FACTORIES IN THE NORTH FOR WE GET ICE
ON NO SUCH TERMS THERE IF ONE TAKE LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
POUNDS AT A DELIVERY
THE ROSALIE YARN MILL OF NATCHEZ HAS A CAPACITY OF 6 000 SPINDLES AND
160 LOOMS AND EMPLOYS 100 HANDS
THE NATCHEZ COTTON MILLS COMPANY BEGAN
OPERATIONS FOUR YEARS AGO IN A TWO STORY BUILDING OF 50 X 190 FEET WITH
4 000 SPINDLES AND 128 LOOMS CAPITAL 105 000 ALL SUBSCRIBED IN THE
TOWN
TWO YEARS LATER THE SAME STOCKHOLDERS INCREASED THEIR CAPITAL TO
225 000 ADDED A THIRD STORY TO THE MILL INCREASED ITS LENGTH TO 317
FEET ADDED MACHINERY TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY TO 10 300 SPINDLES AND
304 LOOMS
THE COMPANY NOW EMPLOY 250 OPERATIVES MANY OF WHOM ARE
CITIZENS OF NATCHEZ
'THE MILL WORKS 5 000 BALES OF COTTON ANNUALLY AND
MANUFACTURES THE BEST STANDARD QUALITY OF BROWN SHIRTINGS AND
SHEETINGS AND DRILLS TURNING OUT 5 000 000 YARDS OF THESE GOODS PER
YEAR FOOTNOTE NEW ORLEANS TIMES DEMOCRAT 26 AUG 1882 A CLOSE
CORPORATION STOCK HELD AT 5 000 PER SHARE BUT NONE IN THE MARKET
THE CHANGES IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER ARE GREAT AND STRANGE YET WERE TO
BE EXPECTED BUT I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO LIVE TO SEE NATCHEZ AND THESE
OTHER RIVER TOWNS BECOME MANUFACTURING STRONGHOLDS AND RAILWAY CENTERS
SPEAKING OF MANUFACTURES REMINDS ME OF A TALK UPON THAT TOPIC WHICH I
HEARD WHICH I OVERHEARD ON BOARD THE CINCINNATI BOAT
I AWOKE OUT OF
A FRETTED SLEEP WITH A DULL CONFUSION OF VOICES IN MY EARS
I
LISTENED TWO MEN WERE TALKING SUBJECT APPARENTLY THE GREAT
INUNDATION
I LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE OPEN TRANSOM
THE TWO MEN WERE
EATING A LATE BREAKFAST SITTING OPPOSITE EACH OTHER NOBODY ELSE
AROUND
THEY CLOSED UP THE INUNDATION WITH A FEW WORDS HAVING USED IT
EVIDENTLY AS A MERE ICE BREAKER AND ACQUAINTANCESHIP BREEDER THEN THEY
DROPPED INTO BUSINESS
IT SOON TRANSPIRED THAT THEY WERE DRUMMERS ONE
BELONGING IN CINCINNATI THE OTHER IN NEW ORLEANS
BRISK MEN ENERGETIC
OF MOVEMENT AND SPEECH THE DOLLAR THEIR GOD HOW TO GET IT THEIR
RELIGION
'NOW AS TO THIS ARTICLE SAID CINCINNATI SLASHING INTO THE OSTENSIBLE
BUTTER AND HOLDING FORWARD A SLAB OF IT ON HIS KNIFE BLADE 'IT'S FROM
OUR HOUSE LOOK AT IT SMELL OF IT TASTE IT
PUT ANY TEST ON IT YOU

OLEOMARGARINE YES SIR THAT'S WHAT IT IS OLEOMARGARINE
YOU CAN'T
TELL IT FROM BUTTER BY GEORGE AN EXPERT CAN'T

BUTTER ON ONE OF THEM
WE ARE CRAWLING RIGHT ALONG JUMPING RIGHT
ALONG IS THE WORD
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT ENTIRE TRADE
YES AND THE
HOTEL TRADE TOO
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE DAY PRETTY SOON WHEN YOU
CAN'T FIND AN OUNCE OF BUTTER TO BLESS YOURSELF WITH IN ANY HOTEL IN
THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEYS OUTSIDE OF THE BIGGEST CITIES
WHY WE
ARE TURNING OUT OLEOMARGARINE NOW BY THE THOUSANDS OF TONS
AND WE CAN
SELL IT SO DIRT CHEAP THAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS GOT TO TAKE IT CAN'T
GET AROUND IT YOU SEE
BUTTER DON'T STAND ANY SHOW THERE AIN'T ANY
CHANCE FOR COMPETITION
BUTTER'S HAD ITS DAY AND FROM THIS OUT
BUTTER GOES TO THE WALL
THERE'S MORE MONEY IN OLEOMARGARINE THAN WHY
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE THE BUSINESS WE DO
I'VE STOPPED IN EVERY TOWN FROM
CINCINNATI TO NATCHEZ AND I'VE SENT HOME BIG ORDERS FROM EVERY ONE OF
THEM
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON FOR TEN MINUTES LONGER IN THE SAME FERVID
STRAIN
THEN NEW ORLEANS PIPED UP AND SAID
YES IT'S A FIRST RATE IMITATION THAT'S A CERTAINTY BUT IT AIN'T THE
ONLY ONE AROUND THAT'S FIRST RATE
FOR INSTANCE THEY MAKE OLIVE OIL OUT
OF COTTON SEED OIL NOWADAYS SO THAT YOU CAN'T TELL THEM APART
'YES THAT'S SO RESPONDED CINCINNATI 'AND IT WAS A TIP TOP BUSINESS
FOR A WHILE
THEY SENT IT OVER AND BROUGHT IT BACK FROM FRANCE AND
ITALY WITH THE UNITED STATES CUSTOM HOUSE MARK ON IT TO INDORSE IT FOR
GENUINE AND THERE WAS NO END OF CASH IN IT BUT FRANCE AND ITALY BROKE
UP THE GAME OF COURSE THEY NATURALLY WOULD
CRACKED ON SUCH A RATTLING
IMPOST THAT COTTON SEED OLIVE OIL COULDN'T STAND THE RAISE HAD TO HANG
UP AND QUIT
'OH IT DID DID IT YOU WAIT HERE A MINUTE
GOES TO HIS STATE ROOM BRINGS BACK A COUPLE OF LONG BOTTLES AND TAKES

SOMETHING GET THAT OUT AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT PERFECTLY EASY THEN TO
TURN THE OIL INTO ANY KIND OF OIL YOU WANT TO AND THERE AIN'T ANYBODY
THAT CAN DETECT THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE
WELL WE KNOW HOW TO GET THAT
ONE LITTLE PARTICLE OUT AND WE'RE THE ONLY FIRM THAT DOES
AND WE TURN
OUT AN OLIVE OIL THAT IS JUST SIMPLY PERFECT UNDETECTABLE WE ARE DOING
A RIPPING TRADE TOO AS I COULD EASILY SHOW YOU BY MY ORDER BOOK FOR
THIS TRIP
MAYBE YOU'LL BUTTER EVERYBODY'S BREAD PRETTY SOON BUT WE'LL
COTTON SEED HIS SALAD FOR HIM FROM THE GULF TO CANADA AND THAT'S A
DEAD CERTAIN THING
CINCINNATI GLOWED AND FLASHED WITH ADMIRATION
THE TWO SCOUNDRELS
EXCHANGED BUSINESS CARDS AND ROSE
AS THEY LEFT THE TABLE CINCINNATI

'BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE CUSTOM HOUSE MARKS DON'T YOU HOW DO YOU MANAGE
THAT
I DID NOT CATCH THE ANSWER
WE PASSED PORT HUDSON SCENE OF TWO OF THE MOST TERRIFIC EPISODES OF THE
WAR THE NIGHT BATTLE THERE BETWEEN FARRAGUT'S FLEET AND THE CONFEDERATE
LAND BATTERIES APRIL 14TH 1863 AND THE MEMORABLE LAND BATTLE TWO
MONTHS LATER WHICH LASTED EIGHT HOURS EIGHT HOURS OF EXCEPTIONALLY
FIERCE AND STUBBORN FIGHTING AND ENDED FINALLY IN THE REPULSE OF THE
UNION FORCES WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER
CHAPTER 40
CASTLES AND CULTURE
BATON ROUGE WAS CLOTHED IN FLOWERS LIKE A BRIDE NO MUCH MORE SO LIKE
A GREENHOUSE
FOR WE WERE IN THE ABSOLUTE SOUTH NOW NO MODIFICATIONS
NO COMPROMISES NO HALF WAY MEASURES
THE MAGNOLIA TREES IN THE CAPITOL
GROUNDS WERE LOVELY AND FRAGRANT WITH THEIR DENSE RICH FOLIAGE AND HUGE
SNOW BALL BLOSSOMS
THE SCENT OF THE FLOWER IS VERY SWEET BUT YOU WANT
DISTANCE ON IT BECAUSE IT IS SO POWERFUL
THEY ARE NOT GOOD BEDROOM
BLOSSOMS THEY MIGHT SUFFOCATE ONE IN HIS SLEEP
WE WERE CERTAINLY
IN THE SOUTH AT LAST FOR HERE THE SUGAR REGION BEGINS AND THE
PLANTATIONS VAST GREEN LEVELS WITH SUGAR MILL AND NEGRO QUARTERS
CLUSTERED TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE WERE IN VIEW
AND THERE WAS A
TROPICAL SUN OVERHEAD AND A TROPICAL SWELTER IN THE AIR
AND AT THIS POINT ALSO BEGINS THE PILOT'S PARADISE A WIDE RIVER HENCE
TO NEW ORLEANS ABUNDANCE OF WATER FROM SHORE TO SHORE AND NO BARS
SNAGS SAWYERS OR WRECKS IN HIS ROAD
SIR WALTER SCOTT IS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAPITOL BUILDING FOR
IT IS NOT CONCEIVABLE THAT THIS LITTLE SHAM CASTLE WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN
BUILT IF HE HAD NOT RUN THE PEOPLE MAD A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS AGO
WITH HIS MEDIEVAL ROMANCES
THE SOUTH HAS NOT YET RECOVERED FROM THE
DEBILITATING INFLUENCE OF HIS BOOKS
ADMIRATION OF HIS FANTASTIC HEROES
AND THEIR GROTESQUE 'CHIVALRY' DOINGS AND ROMANTIC JUVENILITIES STILL
SURVIVES HERE IN AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH IS ALREADY PERCEPTIBLE THE
WHOLESOME AND PRACTICAL NINETEENTH CENTURY SMELL OF COTTON FACTORIES
AND LOCOMOTIVES AND TRACES OF ITS INFLATED LANGUAGE AND OTHER WINDY
HUMBUGGERIES SURVIVE ALONG WITH IT
IT IS PATHETIC ENOUGH THAT A
WHITEWASHED CASTLE WITH TURRETS AND THINGS MATERIALS ALL UNGENUINE
WITHIN AND WITHOUT PRETENDING TO BE WHAT THEY ARE NOT SHOULD EVER
HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THIS OTHERWISE HONORABLE PLACE BUT IT IS MUCH MORE
PATHETIC TO SEE THIS ARCHITECTURAL FALSEHOOD UNDERGOING RESTORATION AND
PERPETUATION IN OUR DAY WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO EASY TO LET
DYNAMITE FINISH WHAT A CHARITABLE FIRE BEGAN AND THEN DEVOTE THIS
RESTORATION MONEY TO THE BUILDING OF SOMETHING GENUINE
BATON ROUGE HAS NO PATENT ON IMITATION CASTLES HOWEVER AND NO MONOPOLY
OF THEM
HERE IS A PICTURE FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE 'FEMALE
INSTITUTE' OF COLUMBIA TENNESSEE
THE FOLLOWING REMARK IS FROM THE SAME
ADVERTISEMENT
'THE INSTITUTE BUILDING HAS LONG BEEN FAMED AS A MODEL OF STRIKING AND
BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE
VISITORS ARE CHARMED WITH ITS RESEMBLANCE TO
THE OLD CASTLES OF SONG AND STORY WITH ITS TOWERS TURRETED WALLS AND
IVY MANTLED PORCHES
KEEPING SCHOOL IN A CASTLE IS A ROMANTIC THING AS ROMANTIC AS KEEPING
HOTEL IN A CASTLE
BY ITSELF THE IMITATION CASTLE IS DOUBTLESS HARMLESS AND WELL ENOUGH
BUT AS A SYMBOL AND BREEDER AND SUSTAINER OF MAUDLIN MIDDLE AGE
ROMANTICISM HERE IN THE MIDST OF THE PLAINEST AND STURDIEST AND
INFINITELY GREATEST AND WORTHIEST OF ALL THE CENTURIES THE WORLD HAS
SEEN IT IS NECESSARILY A HURTFUL THING AND A MISTAKE
HERE IS AN EXTRACT FROM THE PROSPECTUS OF A KENTUCKY 'FEMALE COLLEGE
FEMALE COLLEGE SOUNDS WELL ENOUGH BUT SINCE THE PHRASING IT IN THAT
UNJUSTIFIABLE WAY WAS DONE PURELY IN THE INTEREST OF BREVITY IT SEEMS
TO ME THAT SHE COLLEGE WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL BETTER BECAUSE SHORTER
AND MEANS THE SAME THING THAT IS IF EITHER PHRASE MEANS ANYTHING AT
ALL
'THE PRESIDENT IS SOUTHERN BY BIRTH BY REARING BY EDUCATION AND BY
SENTIMENT THE TEACHERS ARE ALL SOUTHERN IN SENTIMENT AND WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THOSE BORN IN EUROPE WERE BORN AND RAISED IN THE SOUTH
BELIEVING THE SOUTHERN TO BE THE HIGHEST TYPE OF CIVILIZATION THIS
CONTINENT HAS SEEN THE YOUNG LADIES ARE TRAINED ACCORDING TO THE
SOUTHERN IDEAS OF DELICACY REFINEMENT WOMANHOOD RELIGION AND

KNOXVILLE TENN OCTOBER 19 THIS MORNING A FEW MINUTES AFTER TEN
O'CLOCK GENERAL JOSEPH A
MABRY THOMAS O'CONNOR AND JOSEPH A
MABRY
JR WERE KILLED IN A SHOOTING AFFRAY
THE DIFFICULTY BEGAN YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON BY GENERAL MABRY ATTACKING MAJOR O'CONNOR AND THREATENING TO
KILL HIM
THIS WAS AT THE FAIR GROUNDS AND O'CONNOR TOLD MABRY THAT IT
WAS NOT THE PLACE TO SETTLE THEIR DIFFICULTIES
MABRY THEN TOLD O'CONNOR
HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
IT SEEMS THAT MABRY WAS ARMED AND O'CONNOR WAS NOT
THE CAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY WAS AN OLD FEUD ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF SOME
PROPERTY FROM MABRY TO O'CONNOR
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON MABRY SENT WORD
TO O'CONNOR THAT HE WOULD KILL HIM ON SIGHT
THIS MORNING MAJOR O'CONNOR
WAS STANDING IN THE DOOR OF THE MECHANICS' NATIONAL BANK OF WHICH
HE WAS PRESIDENT
GENERAL MABRY AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN WALKED DOWN GAY
STREET ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM THE BANK
O'CONNOR STEPPED INTO THE
BANK GOT A SHOT GUN TOOK DELIBERATE AIM AT GENERAL MABRY AND FIRED
MABRY FELL DEAD BEING SHOT IN THE LEFT SIDE
AS HE FELL O'CONNOR FIRED
AGAIN THE SHOT TAKING EFFECT IN MABRY'S THIGH
O'CONNOR THEN REACHED
INTO THE BANK AND GOT ANOTHER SHOT GUN
ABOUT THIS TIME JOSEPH A
MABRY
JR SON OF GENERAL MABRY CAME RUSHING DOWN THE STREET UNSEEN BY
O'CONNOR UNTIL WITHIN FORTY FEET WHEN THE YOUNG MAN FIRED A PISTOL THE
SHOT TAKING EFFECT IN O'CONNOR'S RIGHT BREAST PASSING THROUGH THE BODY
NEAR THE HEART
THE INSTANT MABRY SHOT O'CONNOR TURNED AND FIRED THE
LOAD TAKING EFFECT IN YOUNG MABRY'S RIGHT BREAST AND SIDE
MABRY FELL
PIERCED WITH TWENTY BUCKSHOT AND ALMOST INSTANTLY O'CONNOR FELL DEAD
WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
MABRY TRIED TO RISE BUT FELL BACK DEAD
THE WHOLE
TRAGEDY OCCURRED WITHIN TWO MINUTES AND NEITHER OF THE THREE SPOKE
AFTER HE WAS SHOT
GENERAL MABRY HAD ABOUT THIRTY BUCKSHOT IN HIS BODY
A BYSTANDER WAS PAINFULLY WOUNDED IN THE THIGH WITH A BUCKSHOT AND
ANOTHER WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
FOUR OTHER MEN HAD THEIR CLOTHING
PIERCED BY BUCKSHOT
THE AFFAIR CAUSED GREAT EXCITEMENT AND GAY STREET
WAS THRONGED WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
GENERAL MABRY AND HIS SON JOE
WERE ACQUITTED ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO OF THE MURDER OF MOSES LUSBY AND DON
LUSBY FATHER AND SON WHOM THEY KILLED A FEW WEEKS AGO
WILL MABRY WAS
KILLED BY DON LUSBY LAST CHRISTMAS
MAJOR THOMAS O'CONNOR WAS PRESIDENT
OF THE MECHANICS' NATIONAL BANK HERE AND WAS THE WEALTHIEST MAN IN THE
STATE ASSOCIATED PRESS TELEGRAM
ONE DAY LAST MONTH PROFESSOR SHARPE OF THE SOMERVILLE TENN
FEMALE COLLEGE 'A QUIET AND GENTLEMANLY MAN WAS TOLD THAT HIS
BROTHER IN LAW A CAPTAIN BURTON HAD THREATENED TO KILL HIM
BURTON IT
SEEMS HAD ALREADY KILLED ONE MAN AND DRIVEN HIS KNIFE INTO ANOTHER
THE
PROFESSOR ARMED HIMSELF WITH A DOUBLE BARRELED SHOT GUN STARTED OUT IN
SEARCH OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW FOUND HIM PLAYING BILLIARDS IN A SALOON
AND BLEW HIS BRAINS OUT
THE 'MEMPHIS AVALANCHE' REPORTS THAT THE
PROFESSOR'S COURSE MET WITH PRETTY GENERAL APPROVAL IN THE COMMUNITY
KNOWING THAT THE LAW WAS POWERLESS IN THE ACTUAL CONDITION OF PUBLIC
SENTIMENT TO PROTECT HIM HE PROTECTED HIMSELF
ABOUT THE SAME TIME TWO YOUNG MEN IN NORTH CAROLINA QUARRELED ABOUT A
GIRL AND 'HOSTILE MESSAGES' WERE EXCHANGED
FRIENDS TRIED TO RECONCILE
THEM BUT HAD THEIR LABOR FOR THEIR PAINS
ON THE 24TH THE YOUNG MEN
MET IN THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY
ONE OF THEM HAD A HEAVY CLUB IN HIS HAND THE
OTHER AN AX
THE MAN WITH THE CLUB FOUGHT DESPERATELY FOR HIS LIFE BUT
IT WAS A HOPELESS FIGHT FROM THE FIRST
A WELL DIRECTED BLOW SENT HIS
CLUB WHIRLING OUT OF HIS GRASP AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS A DEAD MAN
ABOUT THE SAME TIME TWO 'HIGHLY CONNECTED' YOUNG VIRGINIANS CLERKS IN
A HARDWARE STORE AT CHARLOTTESVILLE WHILE 'SKYLARKING CAME TO BLOWS
PETER DICK THREW PEPPER IN CHARLES ROADS'S EYES ROADS DEMANDED AN
APOLOGY DICK REFUSED TO GIVE IT AND IT WAS AGREED THAT A DUEL WAS
INEVITABLE BUT A DIFFICULTY AROSE THE PARTIES HAD NO PISTOLS AND
IT WAS TOO LATE AT NIGHT TO PROCURE THEM
ONE OF THEM SUGGESTED THAT
BUTCHER KNIVES WOULD ANSWER THE PURPOSE AND THE OTHER ACCEPTED THE
SUGGESTION THE RESULT WAS THAT ROADS FELL TO THE FLOOR WITH A GASH IN
HIS ABDOMEN THAT MAY OR MAY NOT PROVE FATAL
IF DICK HAS BEEN ARRESTED
THE NEWS HAS NOT REACHED US
HE 'EXPRESSED DEEP REGRET AND WE ARE
TOLD BY A STAUNTON CORRESPONDENT OF THE PHILADELPHIA PRESS THAT 'EVERY
EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO HUSH THE MATTER UP EXTRACTS FROM THE PUBLIC
JOURNALS
WHAT WARDER HO THE MAN THAT CAN BLOW SO COMPLACENT A BLAST AS THAT
PROBABLY BLOWS IT FROM A CASTLE
FROM BATON ROUGE TO NEW ORLEANS THE GREAT SUGAR PLANTATIONS BORDER BOTH
SIDES OF THE RIVER ALL THE WAY AND STRETCH THEIR LEAGUE WIDE LEVELS
BACK TO THE DIM FOREST WALLS OF BEARDED CYPRESS IN THE REAR
SHORES LONELY NO LONGER
PLENTY OF DWELLINGS ALL THE WAY ON BOTH
BANKS STANDING SO CLOSE TOGETHER FOR LONG DISTANCES THAT THE BROAD
RIVER LYING BETWEEN THE TWO ROWS BECOMES A SORT OF SPACIOUS STREET
A MOST HOME LIKE AND HAPPY LOOKING REGION
AND NOW AND THEN YOU SEE A
PILLARED AND PORTICOED GREAT MANOR HOUSE EMBOWERED IN TREES
HERE IS
TESTIMONY OF ONE OR TWO OF THE PROCESSION OF FOREIGN TOURISTS THAT FILED
ALONG HERE HALF A CENTURY AGO
MRS
TROLLOPE SAYS
'THE UNBROKEN FLATNESS OF THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI CONTINUED
UNVARIED FOR MANY MILES ABOVE NEW ORLEANS BUT THE GRACEFUL AND
LUXURIANT PALMETTO THE DARK AND NOBLE ILEX AND THE BRIGHT ORANGE
WERE EVERYWHERE TO BE SEEN AND IT WAS MANY DAYS BEFORE WE WERE WEARY OF
LOOKING AT THEM
CAPTAIN BASIL HALL
'THE DISTRICT OF COUNTRY WHICH LIES ADJACENT TO THE MISSISSIPPI IN
THE LOWER PARTS OF LOUISIANA IS EVERYWHERE THICKLY PEOPLED BY SUGAR
PLANTERS WHOSE SHOWY HOUSES GAY PIAZZAS TRIG GARDENS AND NUMEROUS
SLAVE VILLAGES ALL CLEAN AND NEAT GAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY THRIVING AIR TO
THE RIVER SCENERY
ALL THE PROCESSION PAINT THE ATTRACTIVE PICTURE IN THE SAME WAY
THE
DESCRIPTIONS OF FIFTY YEARS AGO DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A WORD CHANGED IN
ORDER TO EXACTLY DESCRIBE THE SAME REGION AS IT APPEARS TO DAY EXCEPT
AS TO THE 'TRIGNESS' OF THE HOUSES
THE WHITEWASH IS GONE FROM THE
NEGRO CABINS NOW AND MANY POSSIBLY MOST OF THE BIG MANSIONS ONCE SO
SHINING WHITE HAVE WORN OUT THEIR PAINT AND HAVE A DECAYED NEGLECTED
LOOK
IT IS THE BLIGHT OF THE WAR
TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO EVERYTHING WAS
TRIM AND TRIG AND BRIGHT ALONG THE 'COAST JUST AS IT HAD BEEN IN 1827
AS DESCRIBED BY THOSE TOURISTS
UNFORTUNATE TOURISTS PEOPLE HUMBUGGED THEM WITH STUPID AND SILLY LIES
AND THEN LAUGHED AT THEM FOR BELIEVING AND PRINTING THE SAME
THEY
TOLD MRS
TROLLOPE THAT THE ALLIGATORS OR CROCODILES AS SHE CALLS
THEM WERE TERRIBLE CREATURES AND BACKED UP THE STATEMENT WITH A
BLOOD CURDLING ACCOUNT OF HOW ONE OF THESE SLANDERED REPTILES CREPT INTO
A SQUATTER CABIN ONE NIGHT AND ATE UP A WOMAN AND FIVE CHILDREN
THE WOMAN BY HERSELF WOULD HAVE SATISFIED ANY ORDINARILY IMPOSSIBLE
ALLIGATOR BUT NO THESE LIARS MUST MAKE HIM GORGE THE FIVE CHILDREN
BESIDES
ONE WOULD NOT IMAGINE THAT JOKERS OF THIS ROBUST BREED WOULD BE
SENSITIVE BUT THEY WERE
IT IS DIFFICULT AT THIS DAY TO UNDERSTAND
AND IMPOSSIBLE TO JUSTIFY THE RECEPTION WHICH THE BOOK OF THE GRAVE
HONEST INTELLIGENT GENTLE MANLY CHARITABLE WELL MEANING CAPT
BASIL
HALL GOT
CHAPTER 41
THE METROPOLIS OF THE SOUTH
THE APPROACHES TO NEW ORLEANS WERE FAMILIAR GENERAL ASPECTS WERE
UNCHANGED
WHEN ONE GOES FLYING THROUGH LONDON ALONG A RAILWAY PROPPED
IN THE AIR ON TALL ARCHES HE MAY INSPECT MILES OF UPPER BEDROOMS
THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS BUT THE LOWER HALF OF THE HOUSES IS UNDER
HIS LEVEL AND OUT OF SIGHT
SIMILARLY IN HIGH RIVER STAGE IN THE NEW
ORLEANS REGION THE WATER IS UP TO THE TOP OF THE ENCLOSING LEVEE RIM
THE FLAT COUNTRY BEHIND IT LIES LOW REPRESENTING THE BOTTOM OF A
DISH AND AS THE BOAT SWIMS ALONG HIGH ON THE FLOOD ONE LOOKS DOWN
UPON THE HOUSES AND INTO THE UPPER WINDOWS
THERE IS NOTHING BUT THAT
FRAIL BREASTWORK OF EARTH BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND DESTRUCTION
THE OLD BRICK SALT WAREHOUSES CLUSTERED AT THE UPPER END OF THE CITY
LOOKED AS THEY HAD ALWAYS LOOKED WAREHOUSES WHICH HAD HAD A KIND OF
ALADDIN'S LAMP EXPERIENCE HOWEVER SINCE I HAD SEEN THEM FOR WHEN THE
WAR BROKE OUT THE PROPRIETOR WENT TO BED ONE NIGHT LEAVING THEM PACKED
WITH THOUSANDS OF SACKS OF VULGAR SALT WORTH A COUPLE OF DOLLARS A
SACK AND GOT UP IN THE MORNING AND FOUND HIS MOUNTAIN OF SALT TURNED
INTO A MOUNTAIN OF GOLD SO TO SPEAK SO SUDDENLY AND TO SO DIZZY A
HEIGHT HAD THE WAR NEWS SENT UP THE PRICE OF THE ARTICLE
THE VAST REACH OF PLANK WHARVES REMAINED UNCHANGED AND THERE WERE AS
MANY SHIPS AS EVER BUT THE LONG ARRAY OF STEAMBOATS HAD VANISHED NOT
ALTOGETHER OF COURSE BUT NOT MUCH OF IT WAS LEFT
THE CITY ITSELF HAD NOT CHANGED TO THE EYE
IT HAD GREATLY INCREASED
IN SPREAD AND POPULATION BUT THE LOOK OF THE TOWN WAS NOT ALTERED
THE
DUST WASTE PAPER LITTERED WAS STILL DEEP IN THE STREETS THE DEEP
TROUGH LIKE GUTTERS ALONGSIDE THE CURBSTONES WERE STILL HALF FULL OF
REPOSEFUL WATER WITH A DUSTY SURFACE THE SIDEWALKS WERE STILL IN THE
SUGAR AND BACON REGION ENCUMBERED BY CASKS AND BARRELS AND HOGSHEADS
THE GREAT BLOCKS OF AUSTERELY PLAIN COMMERCIAL HOUSES WERE AS
DUSTY LOOKING AS EVER
CANAL STREET WAS FINER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE AND STIRRING THAN FORMERLY
WITH ITS DRIFTING CROWDS OF PEOPLE ITS SEVERAL PROCESSIONS OF HURRYING
STREET CARS AND TOWARD EVENING ITS BROAD SECOND STORY VERANDAS
CROWDED WITH GENTLEMEN AND LADIES CLOTHED ACCORDING TO THE LATEST MODE
NOT THAT THERE IS ANY 'ARCHITECTURE' IN CANAL STREET TO SPEAK IN BROAD
GENERAL TERMS THERE IS NO ARCHITECTURE IN NEW ORLEANS EXCEPT IN THE
CEMETERIES
IT SEEMS A STRANGE THING TO SAY OF A WEALTHY FAR SEEING
AND ENERGETIC CITY OF A QUARTER OF A MILLION INHABITANTS BUT IT IS
TRUE
THERE IS A HUGE GRANITE U S
CUSTOM HOUSE COSTLY ENOUGH GENUINE
ENOUGH BUT AS A DECORATION IT IS INFERIOR TO A GASOMETER
IT LOOKS LIKE
A STATE PRISON
BUT IT WAS BUILT BEFORE THE WAR
ARCHITECTURE IN AMERICA
MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEEN BORN SINCE THE WAR
NEW ORLEANS I BELIEVE
HAS HAD THE GOOD LUCK AND IN A SENSE THE BAD LUCK TO HAVE HAD NO GREAT
FIRE IN LATE YEARS
IT MUST BE SO
IF THE OPPOSITE HAD BEEN THE CASE
I THINK ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THE 'BURNT DISTRICT' BY THE RADICAL
IMPROVEMENT IN ITS ARCHITECTURE OVER THE OLD FORMS
ONE CAN DO THIS
IN BOSTON AND CHICAGO
THE 'BURNT DISTRICT' OF BOSTON WAS COMMONPLACE
BEFORE THE FIRE BUT NOW THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL DISTRICT IN ANY CITY
IN THE WORLD THAT CAN SURPASS IT OR PERHAPS EVEN RIVAL IT IN BEAUTY
ELEGANCE AND TASTEFULNESS
HOWEVER NEW ORLEANS HAS BEGUN JUST THIS MOMENT AS ONE MAY SAY
WHEN
COMPLETED THE NEW COTTON EXCHANGE WILL BE A STATELY AND BEAUTIFUL
BUILDING MASSIVE SUBSTANTIAL FULL OF ARCHITECTURAL GRACES NO SHAMS
OR FALSE PRETENSES OR UGLINESSES ABOUT IT ANYWHERE
TO THE CITY IT WILL
BE WORTH MANY TIMES ITS COST FOR IT WILL BREED ITS SPECIES
WHAT HAS
BEEN LACKING HITHERTO WAS A MODEL TO BUILD TOWARD SOMETHING TO EDUCATE
EYE AND TASTE A SUGGESTER SO TO SPEAK
THE CITY IS WELL OUTFITTED WITH PROGRESSIVE MEN THINKING SAGACIOUS
LONG HEADED MEN
THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE SPIRIT OF THE CITY AND THE
CITY'S ARCHITECTURE IS LIKE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WAKING AND SLEEP
APPARENTLY THERE IS A 'BOOM' IN EVERYTHING BUT THAT ONE DEAD FEATURE
THE WATER IN THE GUTTERS USED TO BE STAGNANT AND SLIMY AND A POTENT
DISEASE BREEDER BUT THE GUTTERS ARE FLUSHED NOW TWO OR THREE TIMES
A DAY BY POWERFUL MACHINERY IN MANY OF THE GUTTERS THE WATER NEVER
STANDS STILL BUT HAS A STEADY CURRENT
OTHER SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS HAVE
BEEN MADE AND WITH SUCH EFFECT THAT NEW ORLEANS CLAIMS TO BE DURING
THE LONG INTERVALS BETWEEN THE OCCASIONAL YELLOW FEVER ASSAULTS ONE
OF THE HEALTHIEST CITIES IN THE UNION
THERE'S PLENTY OF ICE NOW FOR
EVERYBODY MANUFACTURED IN THE TOWN
IT IS A DRIVING PLACE COMMERCIALLY
AND HAS A GREAT RIVER OCEAN AND RAILWAY BUSINESS
AT THE DATE OF OUR
VISIT IT WAS THE BEST LIGHTED CITY IN THE UNION ELECTRICALLY SPEAKING
THE NEW ORLEANS ELECTRIC LIGHTS WERE MORE NUMEROUS THAN THOSE OF NEW
YORK AND VERY MUCH BETTER
ONE HAD THIS MODIFIED NOONDAY NOT ONLY IN
CANAL AND SOME NEIGHBORING CHIEF STREETS BUT ALL ALONG A STRETCH
OF FIVE MILES OF RIVER FRONTAGE
THERE ARE GOOD CLUBS IN THE CITY
NOW SEVERAL OF THEM BUT RECENTLY ORGANIZED AND INVITING MODERN STYLE
PLEASURE RESORTS AT WEST END AND SPANISH FORT
THE TELEPHONE IS
EVERYWHERE
ONE OF THE MOST NOTABLE ADVANCES IS IN JOURNALISM
THE
NEWSPAPERS AS I REMEMBER THEM WERE NOT A STRIKING FEATURE
NOW THEY
ARE
MONEY IS SPENT UPON THEM WITH A FREE HAND
THEY GET THE NEWS
LET IT COST WHAT IT MAY
THE EDITORIAL WORK IS NOT HACK GRINDING BUT
LITERATURE
AS AN EXAMPLE OF NEW ORLEANS JOURNALISTIC ACHIEVEMENT IT
MAY BE MENTIONED THAT THE 'TIMES DEMOCRAT' OF AUGUST 26 1882 CONTAINED
A REPORT OF THE YEAR'S BUSINESS OF THE TOWNS OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
FROM NEW ORLEANS ALL THE WAY TO ST
PAUL TWO THOUSAND MILES
THAT ISSUE
OF THE PAPER CONSISTED OF FORTY PAGES SEVEN COLUMNS TO THE PAGE TWO
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY COLUMNS IN ALL FIFTEEN HUNDRED WORDS TO THE COLUMN
AN AGGREGATE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND WORDS
THAT IS TO SAY
NOT MUCH SHORT OF THREE TIMES AS MANY WORDS AS THERE ARE IN THIS BOOK
ONE MAY WITH SORROW CONTRAST THIS WITH THE ARCHITECTURE OF NEW ORLEANS
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING OF PUBLIC ARCHITECTURE ONLY
THE DOMESTIC ARTICLE
IN NEW ORLEANS IS REPROACHLESS NOTWITHSTANDING IT REMAINS AS IT ALWAYS
WAS
ALL THE DWELLINGS ARE OF WOOD IN THE AMERICAN PART OF THE TOWN I
MEAN AND ALL HAVE A COMFORTABLE LOOK
THOSE IN THE WEALTHY QUARTER ARE
SPACIOUS PAINTED SNOW WHITE USUALLY AND GENERALLY HAVE WIDE VERANDAS
OR DOUBLE VERANDAS SUPPORTED BY ORNAMENTAL COLUMNS
THESE MANSIONS
STAND IN THE CENTER OF LARGE GROUNDS AND RISE GARLANDED WITH ROSES
OUT OF THE MIDST OF SWELLING MASSES OF SHINING GREEN FOLIAGE AND
MANY COLORED BLOSSOMS
NO HOUSES COULD WELL BE IN BETTER HARMONY WITH
THEIR SURROUNDINGS OR MORE PLEASING TO THE EYE OR MORE HOME LIKE AND
COMFORTABLE LOOKING
ONE EVEN BECOMES RECONCILED TO THE CISTERN PRESENTLY THIS IS A MIGHTY
CASK PAINTED GREEN AND SOMETIMES A COUPLE OF STORIES HIGH WHICH
IS PROPPED AGAINST THE HOUSE CORNER ON STILTS
THERE IS A
MANSION AND BREWERY SUGGESTION ABOUT THE COMBINATION WHICH SEEMS VERY
INCONGRUOUS AT FIRST
BUT THE PEOPLE CANNOT HAVE WELLS AND SO THEY
TAKE RAIN WATER
NEITHER CAN THEY CONVENIENTLY HAVE CELLARS OR
GRAVES FOOTNOTE THE ISRAELITES ARE BURIED IN GRAVES BY PERMISSION I
TAKE IT NOT REQUIREMENT BUT NONE ELSE EXCEPT THE DESTITUTE WHO ARE
BURIED AT PUBLIC EXPENSE
THE GRAVES ARE BUT THREE OR FOUR FEET DEEP
THE TOWN BEING BUILT UPON 'MADE' GROUND SO THEY DO WITHOUT BOTH AND
FEW OF THE LIVING COMPLAIN AND NONE OF THE OTHERS
CHAPTER 42
HYGIENE AND SENTIMENT
THEY BURY THEIR DEAD IN VAULTS ABOVE THE GROUND
THESE VAULTS HAVE
A RESEMBLANCE TO HOUSES SOMETIMES TO TEMPLES ARE BUILT OF MARBLE
GENERALLY ARE ARCHITECTURALLY GRACEFUL AND SHAPELY THEY FACE THE WALKS
AND DRIVEWAYS OF THE CEMETERY AND WHEN ONE MOVES THROUGH THE MIDST OF A
THOUSAND OR SO OF THEM AND SEES THEIR WHITE ROOFS AND GABLES STRETCHING
INTO THE DISTANCE ON EVERY HAND THE PHRASE 'CITY OF THE DEAD' HAS ALL
AT ONCE A MEANING TO HIM
MANY OF THE CEMETERIES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND
ARE KEPT IN PERFECT ORDER
WHEN ONE GOES FROM THE LEVEE OR THE BUSINESS
STREETS NEAR IT TO A CEMETERY HE OBSERVES TO HIMSELF THAT IF THOSE
PEOPLE DOWN THERE WOULD LIVE AS NEATLY WHILE THEY ARE ALIVE AS THEY DO
AFTER THEY ARE DEAD THEY WOULD FIND MANY ADVANTAGES IN IT AND BESIDES
THEIR QUARTER WOULD BE THE WONDER AND ADMIRATION OF THE BUSINESS WORLD
FRESH FLOWERS IN VASES OF WATER ARE TO BE SEEN AT THE PORTALS OF MANY
OF THE VAULTS PLACED THERE BY THE PIOUS HANDS OF BEREAVED PARENTS AND
CHILDREN HUSBANDS AND WIVES AND RENEWED DAILY
A MILDER FORM OF SORROW
FINDS ITS INEXPENSIVE AND LASTING REMEMBRANCER IN THE COARSE AND UGLY
BUT INDESTRUCTIBLE 'IMMORTELLE' WHICH IS A WREATH OR CROSS OR SOME SUCH
EMBLEM MADE OF ROSETTES OF BLACK LINEN WITH SOMETIMES A YELLOW ROSETTE
AT THE CONJUNCTION OF THE CROSS'S BARS KIND OF SORROWFUL BREAST PIN SO
TO SAY
THE IMMORTELLE REQUIRES NO ATTENTION YOU JUST HANG IT UP AND
THERE YOU ARE JUST LEAVE IT ALONE IT WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR GRIEF FOR
YOU AND KEEP IT IN MIND BETTER THAN YOU CAN STANDS WEATHER FIRST RATE
AND LASTS LIKE BOILER IRON
ON SUNNY DAYS PRETTY LITTLE CHAMELEONS GRACEFULLEST OF LEGGED
REPTILES CREEP ALONG THE MARBLE FRONTS OF THE VAULTS AND CATCH FLIES
THEIR CHANGES OF COLOR AS TO VARIETY ARE NOT UP TO THE CREATURE'S
REPUTATION
THEY CHANGE COLOR WHEN A PERSON COMES ALONG AND HANGS UP
AN IMMORTELLE BUT THAT IS NOTHING ANY RIGHT FEELING REPTILE WOULD DO
THAT
I WILL GRADUALLY DROP THIS SUBJECT OF GRAVEYARDS
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
ALL I COULD TO GET DOWN TO THE SENTIMENTAL PART OF IT BUT I CANNOT
ACCOMPLISH IT
I THINK THERE IS NO GENUINELY SENTIMENTAL PART TO IT
IT IS ALL GROTESQUE GHASTLY HORRIBLE
GRAVEYARDS MAY HAVE BEEN
JUSTIFIABLE IN THE BYGONE AGES WHEN NOBODY KNEW THAT FOR EVERY DEAD
BODY PUT INTO THE GROUND TO GLUT THE EARTH AND THE PLANT ROOTS AND THE
AIR WITH DISEASE GERMS FIVE OR FIFTY OR MAYBE A HUNDRED PERSONS MUST
DIE BEFORE THEIR PROPER TIME BUT THEY ARE HARDLY JUSTIFIABLE NOW WHEN
EVEN THE CHILDREN KNOW THAT A DEAD SAINT ENTERS UPON A CENTURY LONG
CAREER OF ASSASSINATION THE MOMENT THE EARTH CLOSES OVER HIS CORPSE
IT
IS A GRIM SORT OF A THOUGHT
THE RELICS OF ST
ANNE UP IN CANADA HAVE
NOW AFTER NINETEEN HUNDRED YEARS GONE TO CURING THE SICK BY THE DOZEN
BUT IT IS MEREST MATTER OF COURSE THAT THESE SAME RELICS WITHIN A
GENERATION AFTER ST
ANNE'S DEATH AND BURIAL MADE SEVERAL
THOUSAND PEOPLE SICK
THEREFORE THESE MIRACLE PERFORMANCES ARE SIMPLY
COMPENSATION NOTHING MORE
ST
ANNE IS SOMEWHAT SLOW PAY FOR A SAINT
IT IS TRUE BUT BETTER A DEBT PAID AFTER NINETEEN HUNDRED YEARS AND
OUTLAWED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAN NOT PAID AT ALL AND MOST
OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE HALO DO NOT PAY AT ALL
WHERE YOU FIND ONE THAT
PAYS LIKE ST
ANNE YOU FIND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THAT TAKE THE BENEFIT
OF THE STATUTE
AND NONE OF THEM PAY ANY MORE THAN THE PRINCIPAL OF WHAT
THEY OWE THEY PAY NONE OF THE INTEREST EITHER SIMPLE OR COMPOUND
A
SAINT CAN NEVER QUITE RETURN THE PRINCIPAL HOWEVER FOR HIS DEAD BODY
KILLS PEOPLE WHEREAS HIS RELICS HEAL ONLY THEY NEVER RESTORE THE
DEAD TO LIFE
THAT PART OF THE ACCOUNT IS ALWAYS LEFT UNSETTLED
'DR

JULIUS LE MOYNE AFTER FIFTY YEARS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE WROTE
THE INHUMATION OF HUMAN BODIES DEAD FROM INFECTIOUS DISEASES RESULTS
IN CONSTANTLY LOADING THE ATMOSPHERE AND POLLUTING THE WATERS WITH
NOT ONLY THE GERMS THAT RISE FROM SIMPLY PUTREFACTION BUT ALSO WITH THE
SPECIFIC GERMS OF THE DISEASES FROM WHICH DEATH RESULTED
'THE GASES FROM BURIED CORPSES WILL RISE TO THE SURFACE THROUGH

IMMEDIATE OUTBREAK OF DISEASE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW NO
3 VOL
135
IN AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE CHICAGO MEDICAL SOCIETY IN ADVOCACY OF
CREMATION DR
CHARLES W
PURDY MADE SOME STRIKING COMPARISONS TO SHOW
WHAT A BURDEN IS LAID UPON SOCIETY BY THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD
'ONE AND ONE FOURTH TIMES MORE MONEY IS EXPENDED ANNUALLY IN FUNERALS
IN THE UNITED STATES THAN THE GOVERNMENT EXPENDS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOL
PURPOSES
FUNERALS COST THIS COUNTRY IN 1880 ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE
LIABILITIES OF ALL THE COMMERCIAL FAILURES IN THE UNITED STATES DURING
THE SAME YEAR AND GIVE EACH BANKRUPT A CAPITAL OF 8 630 WITH WHICH TO
RESUME BUSINESS
FUNERALS COST ANNUALLY MORE MONEY THAN THE VALUE OF THE
COMBINED GOLD AND SILVER YIELD OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE YEAR 1880
THESE FIGURES DO NOT INCLUDE THE SUMS INVESTED IN BURIAL GROUNDS AND
EXPENDED IN TOMBS AND MONUMENTS NOR THE LOSS FROM DEPRECIATION OF
PROPERTY IN THE VICINITY OF CEMETERIES
FOR THE RICH CREMATION WOULD ANSWER AS WELL AS BURIAL FOR THE
CEREMONIES CONNECTED WITH IT COULD BE MADE AS COSTLY AND OSTENTATIOUS
AS A HINDU SUTTEE WHILE FOR THE POOR CREMATION WOULD BE BETTER THAN
BURIAL BECAUSE SO CHEAP FOOTNOTE FOUR OR FIVE DOLLARS IS THE MINIMUM
COST SO CHEAP UNTIL THE POOR GOT TO IMITATING THE RICH WHICH THEY
WOULD DO BY AND BYE
THE ADOPTION OF CREMATION WOULD RELIEVE US OF A
MUCK OF THREADBARE BURIAL WITTICISMS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WOULD
RESURRECT A LOT OF MILDEWED OLD CREMATION JOKES THAT HAVE HAD A REST FOR
TWO THOUSAND YEARS
I HAVE A COLORED ACQUAINTANCE WHO EARNS HIS LIVING BY ODD JOBS AND HEAVY
MANUAL LABOR
HE NEVER EARNS ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A YEAR AND
AS HE HAS A WIFE AND SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN THE CLOSEST SCRIMPING IS
NECESSARY TO GET HIM THROUGH TO THE END OF THE TWELVE MONTHS DEBTLESS
TO SUCH A MAN A FUNERAL IS A COLOSSAL FINANCIAL DISASTER
WHILE I WAS
WRITING ONE OF THE PRECEDING CHAPTERS THIS MAN LOST A LITTLE CHILD
HE WALKED THE TOWN OVER WITH A FRIEND TRYING TO FIND A COFFIN THAT WAS
WITHIN HIS MEANS
HE BOUGHT THE VERY CHEAPEST ONE HE COULD FIND PLAIN
WOOD STAINED
IT COST HIM TWENTY SIX DOLLARS
IT WOULD HAVE COST LESS
THAN FOUR PROBABLY IF IT HAD BEEN BUILT TO PUT SOMETHING USEFUL INTO
HE AND HIS FAMILY WILL FEEL THAT OUTLAY A GOOD MANY MONTHS
CHAPTER 43
THE ART OF INHUMATION
ABOUT THE SAME TIME I ENCOUNTERED A MAN IN THE STREET WHOM I HAD NOT
SEEN FOR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AND SOMETHING LIKE THIS TALK FOLLOWED
I
SAID
'BUT YOU USED TO LOOK SAD AND OLDISH YOU DON'T NOW
WHERE DID YOU GET
ALL THIS YOUTH AND BUBBLING CHEERFULNESS GIVE ME THE ADDRESS
HE CHUCKLED BLITHELY TOOK OFF HIS SHINING TILE POINTED TO A NOTCHED
PINK CIRCLET OF PAPER PASTED INTO ITS CROWN WITH SOMETHING LETTERED ON
IT AND WENT ON CHUCKLING WHILE I READ 'J
B UNDERTAKER THEN
HE CLAPPED HIS HAT ON GAVE IT AN IRREVERENT TILT TO LEEWARD AND CRIED
OUT
'THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER IT USED TO BE ROUGH TIMES WITH ME WHEN YOU
KNEW ME INSURANCE AGENCY BUSINESS YOU KNOW MIGHTY IRREGULAR
BIG
FIRE ALL RIGHT BRISK TRADE FOR TEN DAYS WHILE PEOPLE SCARED AFTER
THAT DULL POLICY BUSINESS TILL NEXT FIRE
TOWN LIKE THIS DON'T HAVE
FIRES OFTEN ENOUGH A FELLOW STRIKES SO MANY DULL WEEKS IN A ROW THAT
HE GETS DISCOURAGED
BUT YOU BET YOU THIS IS THE BUSINESS PEOPLE DON'T
WAIT FOR EXAMPLES TO DIE
NO SIR THEY DROP OFF RIGHT ALONG THERE
AIN'T ANY DULL SPOTS IN THE UNDERTAKER LINE
I JUST STARTED IN WITH
TWO OR THREE LITTLE OLD COFFINS AND A HIRED HEARSE AND NOW LOOK AT THE
THING I'VE WORKED UP A BUSINESS HERE THAT WOULD SATISFY ANY MAN DON'T
CARE WHO HE IS
FIVE YEARS AGO LODGED IN AN ATTIC LIVE IN A SWELL
HOUSE NOW WITH A MANSARD ROOF AND ALL THE MODERN INCONVENIENCES
'DOES A COFFIN PAY SO WELL
IS THERE MUCH PROFIT ON A COFFIN
'GO WAY HOW YOU TALK THEN WITH A CONFIDENTIAL WINK A DROPPING OF
THE VOICE AND AN IMPRESSIVE LAYING OF HIS HAND ON MY ARM 'LOOK HERE
THERE'S ONE THING IN THIS WORLD WHICH ISN'T EVER CHEAP
THAT'S A COFFIN
THERE'S ONE THING IN THIS WORLD WHICH A PERSON DON'T EVER TRY TO JEW YOU

THERE'S ONE THING IN THIS WORLD WHICH A PERSON
DON'T SAY I'LL LOOK AROUND A LITTLE AND IF I FIND I CAN'T DO BETTER
I'LL COME BACK AND TAKE IT THAT'S A COFFIN
THERE'S ONE THING IN THIS
WORLD WHICH A PERSON WON'T TAKE IN PINE IF HE CAN GO WALNUT AND WON'T
TAKE IN WALNUT IF HE CAN GO MAHOGANY AND WON'T TAKE IN MAHOGANY IF HE

NO

'ICE
'HOW IS THAT
'WELL IN ORDINARY TIMES A PERSON DIES AND WE LAY HIM UP IN ICE ONE
DAY TWO DAYS MAYBE THREE TO WAIT FOR FRIENDS TO COME
TAKES A LOT OF
IT MELTS FAST
WE CHARGE JEWELRY RATES FOR THAT ICE AND WAR PRICES FOR
ATTENDANCE
WELL DON'T YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC THEY RUSH
'EM TO THE CEMETERY THE MINUTE THE BREATH'S OUT
NO MARKET FOR ICE IN AN
EPIDEMIC
SAME WITH EMBAMMING
YOU TAKE A FAMILY THAT'S ABLE TO EMBAM
AND YOU'VE GOT A SOFT THING
YOU CAN MENTION SIXTEEN DIFFERENT WAYS TO
DO IT THOUGH THERE AIN'T ONLY ONE OR TWO WAYS WHEN YOU COME DOWN TO
THE BOTTOM FACTS OF IT AND THEY'LL TAKE THE HIGHEST PRICED WAY EVERY
TIME
IT'S HUMAN NATURE HUMAN NATURE IN GRIEF
IT DON'T REASON
YOU SEE
TIME BEING IT DON'T CARE A DAM
ALL IT WANTS IS PHYSICAL
IMMORTALITY FOR DECEASED AND THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT
ALL YOU'VE

YOUR EMBAMMING TRAPS AROUND YOU AND GO TO WORK AND IN A COUPLE OF HOURS
HE IS WORTH A COOL SIX HUNDRED THAT'S WHAT HE'S WORTH
THERE AIN'T
ANYTHING EQUAL TO IT BUT TRADING RATS FOR DI'MONDS IN TIME OF FAMINE
WELL DON'T YOU SEE WHEN THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC PEOPLE DON'T WAIT TO

CHAPTER 44
CITY SIGHTS
THE OLD FRENCH PART OF NEW ORLEANS ANCIENTLY THE SPANISH PART BEARS NO
RESEMBLANCE TO THE AMERICAN END OF THE CITY THE AMERICAN END WHICH LIES
BEYOND THE INTERVENING BRICK BUSINESS CENTER
THE HOUSES ARE MASSED IN
BLOCKS ARE AUSTERELY PLAIN AND DIGNIFIED UNIFORM OF PATTERN WITH HERE
AND THERE A DEPARTURE FROM IT WITH PLEASANT EFFECT ALL ARE PLASTERED
ON THE OUTSIDE AND NEARLY ALL HAVE LONG IRON RAILED VERANDAS RUNNING
ALONG THE SEVERAL STORIES
THEIR CHIEF BEAUTY IS THE DEEP WARM
VARICOLORED STAIN WITH WHICH TIME AND THE WEATHER HAVE ENRICHED THE
PLASTER
IT HARMONIZES WITH ALL THE SURROUNDINGS AND HAS AS NATURAL
A LOOK OF BELONGING THERE AS HAS THE FLUSH UPON SUNSET CLOUDS
THIS
CHARMING DECORATION CANNOT BE SUCCESSFULLY IMITATED NEITHER IS IT TO BE
FOUND ELSEWHERE IN AMERICA
THE IRON RAILINGS ARE A SPECIALTY ALSO
THE PATTERN IS OFTEN
EXCEEDINGLY LIGHT AND DAINTY AND AIRY AND GRACEFUL WITH A LARGE CIPHER
OR MONOGRAM IN THE CENTER A DELICATE COBWEB OF BAFFLING INTRICATE
FORMS WROUGHT IN STEEL
THE ANCIENT RAILINGS ARE HAND MADE AND ARE
NOW COMPARATIVELY RARE AND PROPORTIONATELY VALUABLE
THEY ARE BECOME
BRIC A BRAC
THE PARTY HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF IDLING THROUGH THIS ANCIENT QUARTER OF
NEW ORLEANS WITH THE SOUTH'S FINEST LITERARY GENIUS THE AUTHOR OF 'THE
GRANDISSIMES IN HIM THE SOUTH HAS FOUND A MASTERLY DELINEATOR OF ITS
INTERIOR LIFE AND ITS HISTORY
IN TRUTH I FIND BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE
UNTRAINED EYE AND VACANT MIND CAN INSPECT IT AND LEARN OF IT AND JUDGE
OF IT MORE CLEARLY AND PROFITABLY IN HIS BOOKS THAN BY PERSONAL CONTACT
WITH IT
WITH MR
CABLE ALONG TO SEE FOR YOU AND DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN AND
ILLUMINATE A JOG THROUGH THAT OLD QUARTER IS A VIVID PLEASURE
AND YOU
HAVE A VIVID SENSE AS OF UNSEEN OR DIMLY SEEN THINGS VIVID AND YET
FITFUL AND DARKLING YOU GLIMPSE SALIENT FEATURES BUT LOSE THE FINE
SHADES OR CATCH THEM IMPERFECTLY THROUGH THE VISION OF THE IMAGINATION
A CASE AS IT WERE OF IGNORANT NEAR SIGHTED STRANGER TRAVERSING THE
RIM OF WIDE VAGUE HORIZONS OF ALPS WITH AN INSPIRED AND ENLIGHTENED
LONG SIGHTED NATIVE
WE VISITED THE OLD ST
LOUIS HOTEL NOW OCCUPIED BY MUNICIPAL OFFICES
THERE IS NOTHING STRIKINGLY REMARKABLE ABOUT IT BUT ONE CAN SAY OF IT
AS OF THE ACADEMY OF MUSIC IN NEW YORK THAT IF A BROOM OR A SHOVEL HAS
EVER BEEN USED IN IT THERE IS NO CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO BACK UP THE
FACT
IT IS CURIOUS THAT CABBAGES AND HAY AND THINGS DO NOT GROW IN THE
ACADEMY OF MUSIC BUT NO DOUBT IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF THE INTERRUPTION
OF THE LIGHT BY THE BENCHES AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HOEING THE
CROP EXCEPT IN THE AISLES
THE FACT THAT THE USHERS GROW THEIR
BUTTONHOLE BOUQUETS ON THE PREMISES SHOWS WHAT MIGHT BE DONE IF THEY HAD
THE RIGHT KIND OF AN AGRICULTURAL HEAD TO THE ESTABLISHMENT
WE VISITED ALSO THE VENERABLE CATHEDRAL AND THE PRETTY SQUARE IN FRONT
OF IT THE ONE DIM WITH RELIGIOUS LIGHT THE OTHER BRILLIANT WITH THE
WORLDLY SORT AND LOVELY WITH ORANGE TREES AND BLOSSOMY SHRUBS THEN WE
DROVE IN THE HOT SUN THROUGH THE WILDERNESS OF HOUSES AND OUT ON TO THE
WIDE DEAD LEVEL BEYOND WHERE THE VILLAS ARE AND THE WATER WHEELS TO
DRAIN THE TOWN AND THE COMMONS POPULOUS WITH COWS AND CHILDREN PASSING
BY AN OLD CEMETERY WHERE WE WERE TOLD LIE THE ASHES OF AN EARLY PIRATE
BUT WE TOOK HIM ON TRUST AND DID NOT VISIT HIM
HE WAS A PIRATE WITH
A TREMENDOUS AND SANGUINARY HISTORY AND AS LONG AS HE PRESERVED
UNSPOTTED IN RETIREMENT THE DIGNITY OF HIS NAME AND THE GRANDEUR OF
HIS ANCIENT CALLING HOMAGE AND REVERENCE WERE HIS FROM HIGH AND
LOW BUT WHEN AT LAST HE DESCENDED INTO POLITICS AND BECAME A PALTRY
ALDERMAN THE PUBLIC 'SHOOK' HIM AND TURNED ASIDE AND WEPT
WHEN HE
DIED THEY SET UP A MONUMENT OVER HIM AND LITTLE BY LITTLE HE HAS COME
INTO RESPECT AGAIN BUT IT IS RESPECT FOR THE PIRATE NOT THE ALDERMAN
TO DAY THE LOYAL AND GENEROUS REMEMBER ONLY WHAT HE WAS AND CHARITABLY
FORGET WHAT HE BECAME
THENCE WE DROVE A FEW MILES ACROSS A SWAMP ALONG A RAISED SHELL ROAD
WITH A CANAL ON ONE HAND AND A DENSE WOOD ON THE OTHER AND HERE AND
THERE IN THE DISTANCE A RAGGED AND ANGULAR LIMBED AND MOSS BEARDED
CYPRESS TOP STANDING OUT CLEAR CUT AGAINST THE SKY AND AS QUAINT OF
FORM AS THE APPLE TREES IN JAPANESE PICTURES SUCH WAS OUR COURSE AND
THE SURROUNDINGS OF IT
THERE WAS AN OCCASIONAL ALLIGATOR SWIMMING
COMFORTABLY ALONG IN THE CANAL AND AN OCCASIONAL PICTURESQUE COLORED
PERSON ON THE BANK FLINGING HIS STATUE RIGID REFLECTION UPON THE STILL
WATER AND WATCHING FOR A BITE
AND BY AND BYE WE REACHED THE WEST END A COLLECTION OF HOTELS OF THE
USUAL LIGHT SUMMER RESORT PATTERN WITH BROAD VERANDAS ALL AROUND
AND THE WAVES OF THE WIDE AND BLUE LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN LAPPING THE
THRESHOLDS
WE HAD DINNER ON A GROUND VERANDA OVER THE WATER THE
CHIEF DISH THE RENOWNED FISH CALLED THE POMPANO DELICIOUS AS THE LESS
CRIMINAL FORMS OF SIN
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COME BY RAIL AND CARRIAGE TO WEST END AND TO SPANISH
FORT EVERY EVENING AND DINE LISTEN TO THE BANDS TAKE STROLLS IN
THE OPEN AIR UNDER THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS GO SAILING ON THE LAKE AND
ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES IN VARIOUS AND SUNDRY OTHER WAYS
WE HAD OPPORTUNITIES ON OTHER DAYS AND IN OTHER PLACES TO TEST THE
POMPANO
NOTABLY AT AN EDITORIAL DINNER AT ONE OF THE CLUBS IN THE
CITY
HE WAS IN HIS LAST POSSIBLE PERFECTION THERE AND JUSTIFIED HIS
FAME
IN HIS SUITE WAS A TALL PYRAMID OF SCARLET CRAY FISH LARGE ONES
AS LARGE AS ONE'S THUMB DELICATE PALATABLE APPETIZING
ALSO DEVILED
WHITEBAIT ALSO SHRIMPS OF CHOICE QUALITY AND A PLATTER OF SMALL
SOFT SHELL CRABS OF A MOST SUPERIOR BREED
THE OTHER DISHES WERE WHAT
ONE MIGHT GET AT DELMONICO'S OR BUCKINGHAM PALACE THOSE I HAVE SPOKEN
OF CAN BE HAD IN SIMILAR PERFECTION IN NEW ORLEANS ONLY I SUPPOSE
IN THE WEST AND SOUTH THEY HAVE A NEW INSTITUTION THE BROOM BRIGADE
IT IS COMPOSED OF YOUNG LADIES WHO DRESS IN A UNIFORM COSTUME AND GO
THROUGH THE INFANTRY DRILL WITH BROOM IN PLACE OF MUSKET
IT IS A
VERY PRETTY SIGHT ON PRIVATE VIEW
WHEN THEY PERFORM ON THE STAGE OF
A THEATER IN THE BLAZE OF COLORED FIRES IT MUST BE A FINE AND
FASCINATING SPECTACLE
I SAW THEM GO THROUGH THEIR COMPLEX MANUAL WITH
GRACE SPIRIT AND ADMIRABLE PRECISION
I SAW THEM DO EVERYTHING WHICH
A HUMAN BEING CAN POSSIBLY DO WITH A BROOM EXCEPT SWEEP
I DID NOT SEE
THEM SWEEP
BUT I KNOW THEY COULD LEARN
WHAT THEY HAVE ALREADY LEARNED
PROVES THAT
AND IF THEY EVER SHOULD LEARN AND SHOULD GO ON THE
WAR PATH DOWN TCHOUPITOULAS OR SOME OF THOSE OTHER STREETS AROUND THERE
THOSE THOROUGHFARES WOULD BEAR A GREATLY IMPROVED ASPECT IN A VERY FEW
MINUTES
BUT THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WOULDN'T SO NOTHING WOULD BE REALLY
GAINED AFTER ALL
THE DRILL WAS IN THE WASHINGTON ARTILLERY BUILDING
IN THIS BUILDING
WE SAW MANY INTERESTING RELICS OF THE WAR
ALSO A FINE OIL PAINTING
REPRESENTING STONEWALL JACKSON'S LAST INTERVIEW WITH GENERAL LEE
BOTH
MEN ARE ON HORSEBACK
JACKSON HAS JUST RIDDEN UP AND IS ACCOSTING LEE
THE PICTURE IS VERY VALUABLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE PORTRAITS WHICH ARE
AUTHENTIC
BUT LIKE MANY ANOTHER HISTORICAL PICTURE IT MEANS NOTHING
WITHOUT ITS LABEL
AND ONE LABEL WILL FIT IT AS WELL AS ANOTHER
FIRST INTERVIEW BETWEEN LEE AND JACKSON
LAST INTERVIEW BETWEEN LEE AND JACKSON
JACKSON INTRODUCING HIMSELF TO LEE
JACKSON ACCEPTING LEE'S INVITATION TO DINNER
JACKSON DECLINING LEE'S INVITATION TO DINNER WITH THANKS
JACKSON APOLOGIZING FOR A HEAVY DEFEAT
JACKSON REPORTING A GREAT VICTORY
JACKSON ASKING LEE FOR A MATCH
IT TELLS ONE STORY AND A SUFFICIENT ONE FOR IT SAYS QUITE PLAINLY
AND SATISFACTORILY 'HERE ARE LEE AND JACKSON TOGETHER THE ARTIST
WOULD HAVE MADE IT TELL THAT THIS IS LEE AND JACKSON'S LAST INTERVIEW IF
HE COULD HAVE DONE IT
BUT HE COULDN'T FOR THERE WASN'T ANY WAY TO DO
IT
A GOOD LEGIBLE LABEL IS USUALLY WORTH FOR INFORMATION A TON OF
SIGNIFICANT ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION IN A HISTORICAL PICTURE
IN ROME
PEOPLE WITH FINE SYMPATHETIC NATURES STAND UP AND WEEP IN FRONT OF THE
CELEBRATED 'BEATRICE CENCI THE DAY BEFORE HER EXECUTION IT SHOWS WHAT
A LABEL CAN DO
IF THEY DID NOT KNOW THE PICTURE THEY WOULD INSPECT IT
UNMOVED AND SAY 'YOUNG GIRL WITH HAY FEVER YOUNG GIRL WITH HER HEAD
IN A BAG
I FOUND THE HALF FORGOTTEN SOUTHERN INTONATIONS AND ELISIONS AS PLEASING
TO MY EAR AS THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN
A SOUTHERNER TALKS MUSIC
AT
LEAST IT IS MUSIC TO ME BUT THEN I WAS BORN IN THE SOUTH
THE EDUCATED
SOUTHERNER HAS NO USE FOR AN R EXCEPT AT THE BEGINNING OF A WORD
HE
SAYS 'HONAH AND 'DINNAH AND 'GOVE'NUH AND 'BEFO' THE WAW AND SO
ON
THE WORDS MAY LACK CHARM TO THE EYE IN PRINT BUT THEY HAVE IT TO
THE EAR
WHEN DID THE R DISAPPEAR FROM SOUTHERN SPEECH AND HOW DID IT
COME TO DISAPPEAR THE CUSTOM OF DROPPING IT WAS NOT BORROWED FROM
THE NORTH NOR INHERITED FROM ENGLAND
MANY SOUTHERNERS MOST
SOUTHERNERS PUT A Y INTO OCCASIONAL WORDS THAT BEGIN WITH THE K SOUND
FOR INSTANCE THEY SAY MR
K'YAHTAH CARTER AND SPEAK OF PLAYING
K'YAHDS OR OF RIDING IN THE K'YAHS
AND THEY HAVE THE PLEASANT
CUSTOM LONG AGO FALLEN INTO DECAY IN THE NORTH OF FREQUENTLY EMPLOYING
THE RESPECTFUL 'SIR INSTEAD OF THE CURT YES AND THE ABRUPT NO THEY
SAY 'YES SUH' 'NO SUH
BUT THERE ARE SOME INFELICITIES
SUCH AS 'LIKE' FOR 'AS AND THE
ADDITION OF AN 'AT' WHERE IT ISN'T NEEDED
I HEARD AN EDUCATED GENTLEMAN
SAY 'LIKE THE FLAG OFFICER DID HIS COOK OR HIS BUTLER WOULD HAVE
SAID 'LIKE THE FLAG OFFICER DONE YOU HEAR GENTLEMEN SAY 'WHERE HAVE
YOU BEEN AT AND HERE IS THE AGGRAVATED FORM HEARD A RAGGED STREET
ARAB SAY IT TO A COMRADE 'I WAS A ASK'N' TOM WHAH YOU WAS A SETT'N'
AT THE VERY ELECT CARELESSLY SAY 'WILL' WHEN THEY MEAN 'SHALL' AND
MANY OF THEM SAY 'I DIDN'T GO TO DO IT MEANING 'I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO
IT THE NORTHERN WORD 'GUESS' IMPORTED FROM ENGLAND WHERE IT USED
TO BE COMMON AND NOW REGARDED BY SATIRICAL ENGLISHMEN AS A YANKEE
ORIGINAL IS BUT LITTLE USED AMONG SOUTHERNERS
THEY SAY 'RECKON THEY
HAVEN'T ANY 'DOESN'T' IN THEIR LANGUAGE THEY SAY 'DON'T' INSTEAD
THE UNPOLISHED OFTEN USE 'WENT' FOR 'GONE IT IS NEARLY AS BAD AS
THE NORTHERN 'HADN'T OUGHT THIS REMINDS ME THAT A REMARK OF A VERY
PECULIAR NATURE WAS MADE HERE IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE NORTH A FEW
DAYS AGO 'HE HADN'T OUGHT TO HAVE WENT HOW IS THAT ISN'T THAT A GOOD
DEAL OF A TRIUMPH ONE KNOWS THE ORDERS COMBINED IN THIS HALF BREED'S
ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT INQUIRING ONE PARENT NORTHERN THE OTHER SOUTHERN
TO DAY I HEARD A SCHOOLMISTRESS ASK 'WHERE IS JOHN GONE THIS FORM IS
SO COMMON SO NEARLY UNIVERSAL IN FACT THAT IF SHE HAD USED 'WHITHER'
INSTEAD OF 'WHERE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE SOUNDED LIKE AN AFFECTATION
WE PICKED UP ONE EXCELLENT WORD A WORD WORTH TRAVELING TO NEW ORLEANS
TO GET A NICE LIMBER EXPRESSIVE HANDY WORD 'LAGNIAPPE THEY
PRONOUNCE IT LANNY YAP
IT IS SPANISH SO THEY SAID
WE DISCOVERED IT
AT THE HEAD OF A COLUMN OF ODDS AND ENDS IN THE PICAYUNE THE FIRST DAY
HEARD TWENTY PEOPLE USE IT THE SECOND INQUIRED WHAT IT MEANT THE
THIRD ADOPTED IT AND GOT FACILITY IN SWINGING IT THE FOURTH
IT HAS A
RESTRICTED MEANING BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE SPREAD IT OUT A LITTLE WHEN
THEY CHOOSE
IT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE THIRTEENTH ROLL IN A 'BAKER'S
DOZEN IT IS SOMETHING THROWN IN GRATIS FOR GOOD MEASURE
THE CUSTOM
ORIGINATED IN THE SPANISH QUARTER OF THE CITY
WHEN A CHILD OR A SERVANT
BUYS SOMETHING IN A SHOP OR EVEN THE MAYOR OR THE GOVERNOR FOR AUGHT I
KNOW HE FINISHES THE OPERATION BY SAYING
'GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR LAGNIAPPE
THE SHOPMAN ALWAYS RESPONDS GIVES THE CHILD A BIT OF LICORICE ROOT
GIVES THE SERVANT A CHEAP CIGAR OR A SPOOL OF THREAD GIVES THE
GOVERNOR I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE GIVES THE GOVERNOR SUPPORT LIKELY
WHEN YOU ARE INVITED TO DRINK AND THIS DOES OCCUR NOW AND THEN IN NEW
ORLEANS AND YOU SAY 'WHAT AGAIN NO I'VE HAD ENOUGH THE OTHER
PARTY SAYS 'BUT JUST THIS ONE TIME MORE THIS IS FOR LAGNIAPPE WHEN
THE BEAU PERCEIVES THAT HE IS STACKING HIS COMPLIMENTS A TRIFLE TOO
HIGH AND SEES BY THE YOUNG LADY'S COUNTENANCE THAT THE EDIFICE WOULD
HAVE BEEN BETTER WITH THE TOP COMPLIMENT LEFT OFF HE PUTS HIS 'I BEG
PARDON NO HARM INTENDED INTO THE BRIEFER FORM OF 'OH THAT'S FOR
LAGNIAPPE IF THE WAITER IN THE RESTAURANT STUMBLES AND SPILLS A GILL
OF COFFEE DOWN THE BACK OF YOUR NECK HE SAYS 'FOR LAGNIAPPE SAH AND
GETS YOU ANOTHER CUP WITHOUT EXTRA CHARGE
CHAPTER 45
SOUTHERN SPORTS
IN THE NORTH ONE HEARS THE WAR MENTIONED IN SOCIAL CONVERSATION ONCE A
MONTH SOMETIMES AS OFTEN AS ONCE A WEEK BUT AS A DISTINCT SUBJECT
FOR TALK IT HAS LONG AGO BEEN RELIEVED OF DUTY
THERE ARE SUFFICIENT
REASONS FOR THIS
GIVEN A DINNER COMPANY OF SIX GENTLEMEN TO DAY IT
CAN EASILY HAPPEN THAT FOUR OF THEM AND POSSIBLY FIVE WERE NOT IN THE
FIELD AT ALL
SO THE CHANCES ARE FOUR TO TWO OR FIVE TO ONE THAT THE
WAR WILL AT NO TIME DURING THE EVENING BECOME THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION
AND THE CHANCES ARE STILL GREATER THAT IF IT BECOME THE TOPIC IT WILL
REMAIN SO BUT A LITTLE WHILE
IF YOU ADD SIX LADIES TO THE COMPANY YOU
HAVE ADDED SIX PEOPLE WHO SAW SO LITTLE OF THE DREAD REALITIES OF THE
WAR THAT THEY RAN OUT OF TALK CONCERNING THEM YEARS AGO AND NOW WOULD
SOON WEARY OF THE WAR TOPIC IF YOU BROUGHT IT UP
THE CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE SOUTH
THERE EVERY MAN YOU MEET WAS
IN THE WAR AND EVERY LADY YOU MEET SAW THE WAR
THE WAR IS THE GREAT
CHIEF TOPIC OF CONVERSATION
THE INTEREST IN IT IS VIVID AND CONSTANT
THE INTEREST IN OTHER TOPICS IS FLEETING
MENTION OF THE WAR WILL WAKE
UP A DULL COMPANY AND SET THEIR TONGUES GOING WHEN NEARLY ANY OTHER
TOPIC WOULD FAIL
IN THE SOUTH THE WAR IS WHAT A D
IS ELSEWHERE THEY
DATE FROM IT
ALL DAY LONG YOU HEAR THINGS 'PLACED' AS HAVING HAPPENED
SINCE THE WAW OR DU'IN' THE WAW OR BEFO' THE WAW OR RIGHT AFTAH THE
WAW OR 'BOUT TWO YEAHS OR FIVE YEAHS OR TEN YEAHS BEFO' THE WAW OR
AFTAH THE WAW
IT SHOWS HOW INTIMATELY EVERY INDIVIDUAL WAS VISITED IN
HIS OWN PERSON BY THAT TREMENDOUS EPISODE
IT GIVES THE INEXPERIENCED
STRANGER A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT A VAST AND COMPREHENSIVE CALAMITY
INVASION IS THAN HE CAN EVER GET BY READING BOOKS AT THE FIRESIDE
AT A CLUB ONE EVENING A GENTLEMAN TURNED TO ME AND SAID IN AN ASIDE
'YOU NOTICE OF COURSE THAT WE ARE NEARLY ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE WAR
IT ISN'T BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T ANYTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT BUT BECAUSE
NOTHING ELSE HAS SO STRONG AN INTEREST FOR US
AND THERE IS ANOTHER
REASON IN THE WAR EACH OF US IN HIS OWN PERSON SEEMS TO HAVE SAMPLED
ALL THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU
CAN'T MENTION AN OUTSIDE MATTER OF ANY SORT BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY REMIND
SOME LISTENER OF SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED DURING THE WAR AND OUT HE
COMES WITH IT
OF COURSE THAT BRINGS THE TALK BACK TO THE WAR
YOU MAY
TRY ALL YOU WANT TO TO KEEP OTHER SUBJECTS BEFORE THE HOUSE AND WE MAY
ALL JOIN IN AND HELP BUT THERE CAN BE BUT ONE RESULT THE MOST RANDOM
TOPIC WOULD LOAD EVERY MAN UP WITH WAR REMINISCENCES AND SHUT HIM UP
TOO AND TALK WOULD BE LIKELY TO STOP PRESENTLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TALK
PALE INCONSEQUENTIALITIES WHEN YOU'VE GOT A CRIMSON FACT OR FANCY IN
YOUR HEAD THAT YOU ARE BURNING TO FETCH OUT
THE POET WAS SITTING SOME LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY AND PRESENTLY HE BEGAN
TO SPEAK ABOUT THE MOON
THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO ME REMARKED IN AN 'ASIDE 'THERE
THE MOON IS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE SEAT OF WAR BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT IT
WILL SUGGEST SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY ABOUT THE WAR IN TEN MINUTES FROM
NOW THE MOON AS A TOPIC WILL BE SHELVED
THE POET WAS SAYING HE HAD NOTICED SOMETHING WHICH WAS A SURPRISE TO
HIM HAD HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT DOWN HERE TOWARD THE EQUATOR THE
MOONLIGHT WAS MUCH STRONGER AND BRIGHTER THAN UP NORTH HAD HAD THE
IMPRESSION THAT WHEN HE VISITED NEW ORLEANS MANY YEARS AGO THE MOON
INTERRUPTION FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
'LET ME EXPLAIN THAT
REMINDS ME OF AN ANECDOTE
EVERYTHING IS CHANGED
SINCE THE WAR FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE BUT YOU'LL FIND PEOPLE DOWN HERE
BORN GRUMBLERS WHO SEE NO CHANGE EXCEPT THE CHANGE FOR THE WORSE
THERE
WAS AN OLD NEGRO WOMAN OF THIS SORT
A YOUNG NEW YORKER SAID IN HER
PRESENCE WHAT A WONDERFUL MOON YOU HAVE DOWN HERE SHE SIGHED AND
SAID AH BLESS YO' HEART HONEY YOU OUGHT TO SEEN DAT MOON BEFO' DE
WAW
THE NEW TOPIC WAS DEAD ALREADY
BUT THE POET RESURRECTED IT AND GAVE IT
A NEW START
A BRIEF DISPUTE FOLLOWED AS TO WHETHER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORTHERN
AND SOUTHERN MOONLIGHT REALLY EXISTED OR WAS ONLY IMAGINED
MOONLIGHT
TALK DRIFTED EASILY INTO TALK ABOUT ARTIFICIAL METHODS OF DISPELLING
DARKNESS
THEN SOMEBODY REMEMBERED THAT WHEN FARRAGUT ADVANCED UPON
PORT HUDSON ON A DARK NIGHT AND DID NOT WISH TO ASSIST THE AIM OF THE
CONFEDERATE GUNNERS HE CARRIED NO BATTLE LANTERNS BUT PAINTED THE
DECKS OF HIS SHIPS WHITE AND THUS CREATED A DIM BUT VALUABLE LIGHT
WHICH ENABLED HIS OWN MEN TO GROPE THEIR WAY AROUND WITH CONSIDERABLE
FACILITY
AT THIS POINT THE WAR GOT THE FLOOR AGAIN THE TEN MINUTES NOT
QUITE UP YET
I WAS NOT SORRY FOR WAR TALK BY MEN WHO HAVE BEEN IN A WAR IS ALWAYS
INTERESTING WHEREAS MOON TALK BY A POET WHO HAS NOT BEEN IN THE MOON IS
LIKELY TO BE DULL
WE WENT TO A COCKPIT IN NEW ORLEANS ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON
I HAD NEVER
SEEN A COCK FIGHT BEFORE
THERE WERE MEN AND BOYS THERE OF ALL AGES AND
ALL COLORS AND OF MANY LANGUAGES AND NATIONALITIES
BUT I NOTICED ONE
QUITE CONSPICUOUS AND SURPRISING ABSENCE THE TRADITIONAL BRUTAL FACES
THERE WERE NO BRUTAL FACES
WITH NO COCK FIGHTING GOING ON YOU COULD
HAVE PLAYED THE GATHERING ON A STRANGER FOR A PRAYER MEETING AND AFTER
IT BEGAN FOR A REVIVAL PROVIDED YOU BLINDFOLDED YOUR STRANGER FOR THE
SHOUTING WAS SOMETHING PRODIGIOUS
A NEGRO AND A WHITE MAN WERE IN THE RING EVERYBODY ELSE OUTSIDE
THE
COCKS WERE BROUGHT IN IN SACKS AND WHEN TIME WAS CALLED THEY WERE
TAKEN OUT BY THE TWO BOTTLE HOLDERS STROKED CARESSED POKED TOWARD
EACH OTHER AND FINALLY LIBERATED
THE BIG BLACK COCK PLUNGED INSTANTLY
AT THE LITTLE GRAY ONE AND STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD WITH HIS SPUR
THE
GRAY RESPONDED WITH SPIRIT
THEN THE BABEL OF MANY TONGUED SHOUTINGS
BROKE OUT AND CEASED NOT THENCEFORTH
WHEN THE COCKS HAD BEEN FIGHTING
SOME LITTLE TIME I WAS EXPECTING THEM MOMENTLY TO DROP DEAD FOR BOTH
WERE BLIND RED WITH BLOOD AND SO EXHAUSTED THAT THEY FREQUENTLY FELL
DOWN
YET THEY WOULD NOT GIVE UP NEITHER WOULD THEY DIE
THE NEGRO AND
THE WHITE MAN WOULD PICK THEM UP EVERY FEW SECONDS WIPE THEM OFF BLOW
COLD WATER ON THEM IN A FINE SPRAY AND TAKE THEIR HEADS IN THEIR MOUTHS
AND HOLD THEM THERE A MOMENT TO WARM BACK THE PERISHING LIFE PERHAPS
I DO NOT KNOW
THEN BEING SET DOWN AGAIN THE DYING CREATURES WOULD
TOTTER GROPINGLY ABOUT WITH DRAGGING WINGS FIND EACH OTHER STRIKE A
GUESSWORK BLOW OR TWO AND FALL EXHAUSTED ONCE MORE
I DID NOT SEE THE END OF THE BATTLE
I FORCED MYSELF TO ENDURE IT
AS LONG AS I COULD BUT IT WAS TOO PITIFUL A SIGHT SO I MADE FRANK
CONFESSION TO THAT EFFECT AND WE RETIRED
WE HEARD AFTERWARD THAT THE
BLACK COCK DIED IN THE RING AND FIGHTING TO THE LAST
EVIDENTLY THERE IS ABUNDANT FASCINATION ABOUT THIS 'SPORT' FOR SUCH
AS HAVE HAD A DEGREE OF FAMILIARITY WITH IT
I NEVER SAW PEOPLE ENJOY
ANYTHING MORE THAN THIS GATHERING ENJOYED THIS FIGHT
THE CASE WAS THE
SAME WITH OLD GRAY HEADS AND WITH BOYS OF TEN
THEY LOST THEMSELVES
IN FRENZIES OF DELIGHT
THE 'COCKING MAIN' IS AN INHUMAN SORT OF
ENTERTAINMENT THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT STILL IT SEEMS A MUCH
MORE RESPECTABLE AND FAR LESS CRUEL SPORT THAN FOX HUNTING FOR THE
COCKS LIKE IT THEY EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS CONFER ENJOYMENT WHICH IS
NOT THE FOX'S CASE
WE ASSISTED IN THE FRENCH SENSE AT A MULE RACE ONE DAY
I BELIEVE I
ENJOYED THIS CONTEST MORE THAN ANY OTHER MULE THERE
I ENJOYED IT MORE
THAN I REMEMBER HAVING ENJOYED ANY OTHER ANIMAL RACE I EVER SAW
THE
GRAND STAND WAS WELL FILLED WITH THE BEAUTY AND THE CHIVALRY OF NEW
ORLEANS
THAT PHRASE IS NOT ORIGINAL WITH ME
IT IS THE SOUTHERN
REPORTER'S
HE HAS USED IT FOR TWO GENERATIONS
HE USES IT TWENTY
TIMES A DAY OR TWENTY THOUSAND TIMES A DAY OR A MILLION TIMES A
DAY ACCORDING TO THE EXIGENCIES
HE IS OBLIGED TO USE IT A MILLION
TIMES A DAY IF HE HAVE OCCASION TO SPEAK OF RESPECTABLE MEN AND WOMEN
THAT OFTEN FOR HE HAS NO OTHER PHRASE FOR SUCH SERVICE EXCEPT THAT
SINGLE ONE
HE NEVER TIRES OF IT IT ALWAYS HAS A FINE SOUND TO HIM
THERE IS A KIND OF SWELL MEDIEVAL BULLINESS AND TINSEL ABOUT IT THAT
PLEASES HIS GAUDY BARBARIC SOUL
IF HE HAD BEEN IN PALESTINE IN THE
EARLY TIMES WE SHOULD HAVE HAD NO REFERENCES TO 'MUCH PEOPLE' OUT OF
HIM
NO HE WOULD HAVE SAID 'THE BEAUTY AND THE CHIVALRY OF GALILEE'
ASSEMBLED TO HEAR THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT
IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MEN
AND WOMEN OF THE SOUTH ARE SICK ENOUGH OF THAT PHRASE BY THIS TIME AND
WOULD LIKE A CHANGE BUT THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF THEIR GETTING
IT
THE NEW ORLEANS EDITOR HAS A STRONG COMPACT DIRECT UNFLOWERY
STYLE WASTES NO WORDS AND DOES NOT GUSH
NOT SO WITH HIS AVERAGE
CORRESPONDENT
IN THE APPENDIX I HAVE QUOTED A GOOD LETTER PENNED BY A
TRAINED HAND BUT THE AVERAGE CORRESPONDENT HURLS A STYLE WHICH DIFFERS
FROM THAT
FOR INSTANCE
THE 'TIMES DEMOCRAT' SENT A RELIEF STEAMER UP ONE OF THE BAYOUS LAST
APRIL
THIS STEAMER LANDED AT A VILLAGE UP THERE SOMEWHERE AND THE
CAPTAIN INVITED SOME OF THE LADIES OF THE VILLAGE TO MAKE A SHORT TRIP
WITH HIM
THEY ACCEPTED AND CAME ABOARD AND THE STEAMBOAT SHOVED OUT
UP THE CREEK
THAT WAS ALL THERE WAS 'TO IT AND THAT IS ALL THAT
THE EDITOR OF THE 'TIMES DEMOCRAT' WOULD HAVE GOT OUT OF IT
THERE WAS
NOTHING IN THE THING BUT STATISTICS AND HE WOULD HAVE GOT NOTHING ELSE
OUT OF IT
HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE EVEN TABULATED THEM PARTLY TO SECURE
PERFECT CLEARNESS OF STATEMENT AND PARTLY TO SAVE SPACE
BUT HIS
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT KNOWS OTHER METHODS OF HANDLING STATISTICS
HE
JUST THROWS OFF ALL RESTRAINT AND WALLOWS IN THEM
'ON SATURDAY EARLY IN THE MORNING THE BEAUTY OF THE PLACE GRACED OUR
CABIN AND PROUD OF HER FAIR FREIGHT THE GALLANT LITTLE BOAT GLIDED UP
THE BAYOU
TWENTY TWO WORDS TO SAY THE LADIES CAME ABOARD AND THE BOAT SHOVED
OUT UP THE CREEK IS A CLEAN WASTE OF TEN GOOD WORDS AND IS ALSO
DESTRUCTIVE OF COMPACTNESS OF STATEMENT
THE TROUBLE WITH THE SOUTHERN REPORTER IS WOMEN
THEY UNSETTLE
HIM THEY THROW HIM OFF HIS BALANCE
HE IS PLAIN AND SENSIBLE AND
SATISFACTORY UNTIL A WOMAN HEAVES IN SIGHT
THEN HE GOES ALL TO PIECES
HIS MIND TOTTERS HE BECOMES FLOWERY AND IDIOTIC
FROM READING THE ABOVE
EXTRACT YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS STUDENT OF SIR WALTER SCOTT IS
AN APPRENTICE AND KNOWS NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT HANDLING A PEN
ON THE
CONTRARY HE FURNISHES PLENTY OF PROOFS IN HIS LONG LETTER THAT HE
KNOWS WELL ENOUGH HOW TO HANDLE IT WHEN THE WOMEN ARE NOT AROUND TO GIVE
HIM THE ARTIFICIAL FLOWER COMPLAINT
FOR INSTANCE
'AT 4 O'CLOCK OMINOUS CLOUDS BEGAN TO GATHER IN THE SOUTH EAST AND
PRESENTLY FROM THE GULF THERE CAME A BLOW WHICH INCREASED IN SEVERITY
EVERY MOMENT
IT WAS NOT SAFE TO LEAVE THE LANDING THEN AND THERE WAS
A DELAY
THE OAKS SHOOK OFF LONG TRESSES OF THEIR MOSSY BEARDS TO THE
TUGGING OF THE WIND AND THE BAYOU IN ITS AMBITION PUT ON MINIATURE
WAVES IN MOCKING OF MUCH LARGER BODIES OF WATER
A LULL PERMITTED A
START AND HOMEWARDS WE STEAMED AN INKY SKY OVERHEAD AND A HEAVY WIND
BLOWING
AS DARKNESS CREPT ON THERE WERE FEW ON BOARD WHO DID NOT WISH
THEMSELVES NEARER HOME
THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH THAT
IT IS GOOD DESCRIPTION COMPACTLY
PUT
YET THERE WAS GREAT TEMPTATION THERE TO DROP INTO LURID WRITING
BUT LET US RETURN TO THE MULE
SINCE I LEFT HIM I HAVE RUMMAGED AROUND
AND FOUND A FULL REPORT OF THE RACE
IN IT I FIND CONFIRMATION OF THE
THEORY WHICH I BROACHED JUST NOW NAMELY THAT THE TROUBLE WITH THE
SOUTHERN REPORTER IS WOMEN WOMEN SUPPLEMENTED BY WALTER SCOTT AND HIS
KNIGHTS AND BEAUTY AND CHIVALRY AND SO ON
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT REPORT
AS LONG AS THE WOMEN STAY OUT OF IT
BUT WHEN THEY INTRUDE WE HAVE THIS
FRANTIC RESULT
'IT WILL BE PROBABLY A LONG TIME BEFORE THE LADIES' STAND PRESENTS SUCH
A SEA OF FOAM LIKE LOVELINESS AS IT DID YESTERDAY
THE NEW ORLEANS WOMEN
ARE ALWAYS CHARMING BUT NEVER SO MUCH SO AS AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR
WHEN IN THEIR DAINTY SPRING COSTUMES THEY BRING WITH THEM A BREATH OF
BALMY FRESHNESS AND AN ODOR OF SANCTITY UNSPEAKABLE
THE STAND WAS SO
CROWDED WITH THEM THAT WALKING AT THEIR FEET AND SEEING NO POSSIBILITY
OF APPROACH MANY A MAN APPRECIATED AS HE NEVER DID BEFORE THE PERI'S
FEELING AT THE GATES OF PARADISE AND WONDERED WHAT WAS THE PRICELESS
BOON THAT WOULD ADMIT HIM TO THEIR SACRED PRESENCE
SPARKLING ON THEIR
WHITE ROBED BREASTS OR SHOULDERS WERE THE COLORS OF THEIR FAVORITE
KNIGHTS AND WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT THAT THE DOUGHTY HEROES APPEARED
ON UNROMANTIC MULES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO IMAGINE ONE OF KING
ARTHUR'S GALA DAYS
THERE WERE THIRTEEN MULES IN THE FIRST HEAT ALL SORTS OF MULES THEY
WERE ALL SORTS OF COMPLEXIONS GAITS DISPOSITIONS ASPECTS
SOME WERE
HANDSOME CREATURES SOME WERE NOT SOME WERE SLEEK SOME HADN'T HAD
THEIR FUR BRUSHED LATELY SOME WERE INNOCENTLY GAY AND FRISKY SOME WERE
FULL OF MALICE AND ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS GUESSING FROM LOOKS SOME OF
THEM THOUGHT THE MATTER ON HAND WAS WAR SOME THOUGHT IT WAS A LARK THE
REST TOOK IT FOR A RELIGIOUS OCCASION
AND EACH MULE ACTED ACCORDING TO
HIS CONVICTIONS
THE RESULT WAS AN ABSENCE OF HARMONY WELL COMPENSATED
BY A CONSPICUOUS PRESENCE OF VARIETY VARIETY OF A PICTURESQUE AND
ENTERTAINING SORT
ALL THE RIDERS WERE YOUNG GENTLEMEN IN FASHIONABLE SOCIETY
IF THE
READER HAS BEEN WONDERING WHY IT IS THAT THE LADIES OF NEW ORLEANS
ATTEND SO HUMBLE AN ORGY AS A MULE RACE THE THING IS EXPLAINED NOW
IT
IS A FASHION FREAK ALL CONNECTED WITH IT ARE PEOPLE OF FASHION
IT IS GREAT FUN AND CORDIALLY LIKED
THE MULE RACE IS ONE OF THE MARKED
OCCASIONS OF THE YEAR
IT HAS BROUGHT SOME PRETTY FAST MULES TO THE
FRONT
ONE OF THESE HAD TO BE RULED OUT BECAUSE HE WAS SO FAST THAT HE
TURNED THE THING INTO A ONE MULE CONTEST AND ROBBED IT OF ONE OF ITS
BEST FEATURES VARIETY
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN SOMEBODY DISGUISES HIM
WITH A NEW NAME AND A NEW COMPLEXION AND RINGS HIM IN AGAIN
THE RIDERS DRESS IN FULL JOCKEY COSTUMES OF BRIGHT COLORED SILKS
SATINS AND VELVETS
THE THIRTEEN MULES GOT AWAY IN A BODY AFTER A COUPLE OF FALSE STARTS
AND SCAMPERED OFF WITH PRODIGIOUS SPIRIT
AS EACH MULE AND EACH RIDER
HAD A DISTINCT OPINION OF HIS OWN AS TO HOW THE RACE OUGHT TO BE RUN
AND WHICH SIDE OF THE TRACK WAS BEST IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND HOW
OFTEN THE TRACK OUGHT TO BE CROSSED AND WHEN A COLLISION OUGHT TO
BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN IT OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED THESE TWENTY SIX
CONFLICTING OPINIONS CREATED A MOST FANTASTIC AND PICTURESQUE CONFUSION
AND THE RESULTING SPECTACLE WAS KILLINGLY COMICAL
MILE HEAT TIME 2 22
EIGHT OF THE THIRTEEN MULES DISTANCED
I HAD A BET
ON A MULE WHICH WOULD HAVE WON IF THE PROCESSION HAD BEEN REVERSED
THE
SECOND HEAT WAS GOOD FUN AND SO WAS THE 'CONSOLATION RACE FOR BEATEN
MULES WHICH FOLLOWED LATER BUT THE FIRST HEAT WAS THE BEST IN THAT
RESPECT
I THINK THAT MUCH THE MOST ENJOYABLE OF ALL RACES IS A STEAMBOAT RACE
BUT NEXT TO THAT I PREFER THE GAY AND JOYOUS MULE RUSH
TWO RED HOT
STEAMBOATS RAGING ALONG NECK AND NECK STRAINING EVERY NERVE THAT IS
TO SAY EVERY RIVET IN THE BOILERS QUAKING AND SHAKING AND GROANING
FROM STEM TO STERN SPOUTING WHITE STEAM FROM THE PIPES POURING BLACK
SMOKE FROM THE CHIMNEYS RAINING DOWN SPARKS PARTING THE RIVER INTO
LONG BREAKS OF HISSING FOAM THIS IS SPORT THAT MAKES A BODY'S VERY
LIVER CURL WITH ENJOYMENT
A HORSE RACE IS PRETTY TAME AND COLORLESS
IN COMPARISON
STILL A HORSE RACE MIGHT BE WELL ENOUGH IN ITS WAY
PERHAPS IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE TIRESOME FALSE STARTS
BUT THEN
NOBODY IS EVER KILLED
AT LEAST NOBODY WAS EVER KILLED WHEN I WAS AT A
HORSE RACE
THEY HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED IT IS TRUE BUT THIS IS LITTLE TO
THE PURPOSE
CHAPTER 46
ENCHANTMENTS AND ENCHANTERS
THE LARGEST ANNUAL EVENT IN NEW ORLEANS IS A SOMETHING WHICH WE ARRIVED
TOO LATE TO SAMPLE THE MARDI GRAS FESTIVITIES
I SAW THE PROCESSION OF
THE MYSTIC CREW OF COMUS THERE TWENTY FOUR YEARS AGO WITH KNIGHTS
AND NOBLES AND SO ON CLOTHED IN SILKEN AND GOLDEN PARIS MADE
GORGEOUSNESSES PLANNED AND BOUGHT FOR THAT SINGLE NIGHT'S USE AND
IN THEIR TRAIN ALL MANNER OF GIANTS DWARFS MONSTROSITIES AND OTHER
DIVERTING GROTESQUERIE A STARTLING AND WONDERFUL SORT OF SHOW AS IT
FILED SOLEMNLY AND SILENTLY DOWN THE STREET IN THE LIGHT OF ITS SMOKING
AND FLICKERING TORCHES BUT IT IS SAID THAT IN THESE LATTER DAYS THE
SPECTACLE IS MIGHTILY AUGMENTED AS TO COST SPLENDOR AND VARIETY
THERE IS A CHIEF PERSONAGE 'REX AND IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY NEITHER
THIS KING NOR ANY OF HIS GREAT FOLLOWING OF SUBORDINATES IS KNOWN TO ANY
OUTSIDER
ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GENTLEMEN OF POSITION AND CONSEQUENCE
AND IT IS A PROUD THING TO BELONG TO THE ORGANIZATION SO THE MYSTERY IN
WHICH THEY HIDE THEIR PERSONALITY IS MERELY FOR ROMANCE'S SAKE AND NOT
ON ACCOUNT OF THE POLICE
MARDI GRAS IS OF COURSE A RELIC OF THE FRENCH AND SPANISH OCCUPATION
BUT I JUDGE THAT THE RELIGIOUS FEATURE HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL KNOCKED OUT
OF IT NOW
SIR WALTER HAS GOT THE ADVANTAGE OF THE GENTLEMEN OF THE COWL
AND ROSARY AND HE WILL STAY
HIS MEDIEVAL BUSINESS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE
MONSTERS AND THE ODDITIES AND THE PLEASANT CREATURES FROM FAIRY LAND
IS FINER TO LOOK AT THAN THE POOR FANTASTIC INVENTIONS AND PERFORMANCES
OF THE REVELING RABBLE OF THE PRIEST'S DAY AND SERVES QUITE AS WELL
PERHAPS TO EMPHASIZE THE DAY AND ADMONISH MEN THAT THE GRACE LINE
BETWEEN THE WORLDLY SEASON AND THE HOLY ONE IS REACHED
THIS MARDI GRAS PAGEANT WAS THE EXCLUSIVE POSSESSION OF NEW ORLEANS
UNTIL RECENTLY
BUT NOW IT HAS SPREAD TO MEMPHIS AND ST
LOUIS AND
BALTIMORE
IT HAS PROBABLY REACHED ITS LIMIT
IT IS A THING WHICH COULD
HARDLY EXIST IN THE PRACTICAL NORTH WOULD CERTAINLY LAST BUT A VERY
BRIEF TIME AS BRIEF A TIME AS IT WOULD LAST IN LONDON
FOR THE SOUL
OF IT IS THE ROMANTIC NOT THE FUNNY AND THE GROTESQUE
TAKE AWAY THE
ROMANTIC MYSTERIES THE KINGS AND KNIGHTS AND BIG SOUNDING TITLES AND
MARDI GRAS WOULD DIE DOWN THERE IN THE SOUTH
THE VERY FEATURE THAT
KEEPS IT ALIVE IN THE SOUTH GIRLY GIRLY ROMANCE WOULD KILL IT IN THE
NORTH OR IN LONDON
PUCK AND PUNCH AND THE PRESS UNIVERSAL WOULD FALL
UPON IT AND MAKE MERCILESS FUN OF IT AND ITS FIRST EXHIBITION WOULD BE
ALSO ITS LAST
AGAINST THE CRIMES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND OF BONAPARTE MAY BE SET
TWO COMPENSATING BENEFACTIONS THE REVOLUTION BROKE THE CHAINS OF THE
ANCIEN REGIME AND OF THE CHURCH AND MADE OF A NATION OF ABJECT SLAVES
A NATION OF FREEMEN AND BONAPARTE INSTITUTED THE SETTING OF MERIT ABOVE
BIRTH AND ALSO SO COMPLETELY STRIPPED THE DIVINITY FROM ROYALTY THAT
WHEREAS CROWNED HEADS IN EUROPE WERE GODS BEFORE THEY ARE ONLY MEN
SINCE AND CAN NEVER BE GODS AGAIN BUT ONLY FIGUREHEADS AND ANSWERABLE
FOR THEIR ACTS LIKE COMMON CLAY
SUCH BENEFACTIONS AS THESE COMPENSATE
THE TEMPORARY HARM WHICH BONAPARTE AND THE REVOLUTION DID AND LEAVE THE
WORLD IN DEBT TO THEM FOR THESE GREAT AND PERMANENT SERVICES TO LIBERTY
HUMANITY AND PROGRESS
THEN COMES SIR WALTER SCOTT WITH HIS ENCHANTMENTS AND BY HIS SINGLE
MIGHT CHECKS THIS WAVE OF PROGRESS AND EVEN TURNS IT BACK SETS THE
WORLD IN LOVE WITH DREAMS AND PHANTOMS WITH DECAYED AND SWINISH FORMS
OF RELIGION WITH DECAYED AND DEGRADED SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT WITH
THE SILLINESSES AND EMPTINESSES SHAM GRANDEURS SHAM GAUDS AND SHAM
CHIVALRIES OF A BRAINLESS AND WORTHLESS LONG VANISHED SOCIETY
HE DID
MEASURELESS HARM MORE REAL AND LASTING HARM PERHAPS THAN ANY OTHER
INDIVIDUAL THAT EVER WROTE
MOST OF THE WORLD HAS NOW OUTLIVED GOOD PART
OF THESE HARMS THOUGH BY NO MEANS ALL OF THEM BUT IN OUR SOUTH THEY
FLOURISH PRETTY FORCEFULLY STILL
NOT SO FORCEFULLY AS HALF A GENERATION
AGO PERHAPS BUT STILL FORCEFULLY
THERE THE GENUINE AND WHOLESOME
CIVILIZATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS CURIOUSLY CONFUSED AND
COMMINGLED WITH THE WALTER SCOTT MIDDLE AGE SHAM CIVILIZATION AND SO
YOU HAVE PRACTICAL COMMON SENSE PROGRESSIVE IDEAS AND PROGRESSIVE
WORKS MIXED UP WITH THE DUEL THE INFLATED SPEECH AND THE JEJUNE
ROMANTICISM OF AN ABSURD PAST THAT IS DEAD AND OUT OF CHARITY OUGHT
TO BE BURIED
BUT FOR THE SIR WALTER DISEASE THE CHARACTER OF THE
SOUTHERNER OR SOUTHRON ACCORDING TO SIR WALTER'S STARCHIER WAY OF
PHRASING IT WOULD BE WHOLLY MODERN IN PLACE OF MODERN AND MEDIEVAL
MIXED AND THE SOUTH WOULD BE FULLY A GENERATION FURTHER ADVANCED THAN
IT IS
IT WAS SIR WALTER THAT MADE EVERY GENTLEMAN IN THE SOUTH A MAJOR
OR A COLONEL OR A GENERAL OR A JUDGE BEFORE THE WAR AND IT WAS HE
ALSO THAT MADE THESE GENTLEMEN VALUE THESE BOGUS DECORATIONS
FOR IT
WAS HE THAT CREATED RANK AND CASTE DOWN THERE AND ALSO REVERENCE
FOR RANK AND CASTE AND PRIDE AND PLEASURE IN THEM
ENOUGH IS LAID ON
SLAVERY WITHOUT FATHERING UPON IT THESE CREATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF
SIR WALTER
SIR WALTER HAD SO LARGE A HAND IN MAKING SOUTHERN CHARACTER AS IT
EXISTED BEFORE THE WAR THAT HE IS IN GREAT MEASURE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE WAR
IT SEEMS A LITTLE HARSH TOWARD A DEAD MAN TO SAY THAT WE NEVER
SHOULD HAVE HAD ANY WAR BUT FOR SIR WALTER AND YET SOMETHING OF A
PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT MIGHT PERHAPS BE MADE IN SUPPORT OF THAT WILD
PROPOSITION
THE SOUTHERNER OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION OWNED SLAVES SO
DID THE SOUTHERNER OF THE CIVIL WAR BUT THE FORMER RESEMBLES THE LATTER
AS AN ENGLISHMAN RESEMBLES A FRENCHMAN
THE CHANGE OF CHARACTER CAN BE
TRACED RATHER MORE EASILY TO SIR WALTER'S INFLUENCE THAN TO THAT OF ANY
OTHER THING OR PERSON
ONE MAY OBSERVE BY ONE OR TWO SIGNS HOW DEEPLY THAT INFLUENCE
PENETRATED AND HOW STRONGLY IT HOLDS
IF ONE TAKE UP A NORTHERN OR
SOUTHERN LITERARY PERIODICAL OF FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS AGO HE WILL
FIND IT FILLED WITH WORDY WINDY FLOWERY 'ELOQUENCE ROMANTICISM
SENTIMENTALITY ALL IMITATED FROM SIR WALTER AND SUFFICIENTLY BADLY
DONE TOO INNOCENT TRAVESTIES OF HIS STYLE AND METHODS IN FACT
THIS
SORT OF LITERATURE BEING THE FASHION IN BOTH SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY
THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FAIREST COMPETITION AND AS A CONSEQUENCE
THE SOUTH WAS ABLE TO SHOW AS MANY WELL KNOWN LITERARY NAMES
PROPORTIONED TO POPULATION AS THE NORTH COULD
BUT A CHANGE HAS COME AND THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY NOW FOR A FAIR
COMPETITION BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH
FOR THE NORTH HAS THROWN OUT
THAT OLD INFLATED STYLE WHEREAS THE SOUTHERN WRITER STILL CLINGS
TO IT CLINGS TO IT AND HAS A RESTRICTED MARKET FOR HIS WARES AS A
CONSEQUENCE
THERE IS AS MUCH LITERARY TALENT IN THE SOUTH NOW AS EVER
THERE WAS OF COURSE BUT ITS WORK CAN GAIN BUT SLIGHT CURRENCY UNDER
PRESENT CONDITIONS THE AUTHORS WRITE FOR THE PAST NOT THE PRESENT
THEY USE OBSOLETE FORMS AND A DEAD LANGUAGE
BUT WHEN A SOUTHERNER OF
GENIUS WRITES MODERN ENGLISH HIS BOOK GOES UPON CRUTCHES NO LONGER BUT
UPON WINGS AND THEY CARRY IT SWIFTLY ALL ABOUT AMERICA AND ENGLAND
AND THROUGH THE GREAT ENGLISH REPRINT PUBLISHING HOUSES OF GERMANY AS
WITNESS THE EXPERIENCE OF MR
CABLE AND UNCLE REMUS TWO OF THE VERY
FEW SOUTHERN AUTHORS WHO DO NOT WRITE IN THE SOUTHERN STYLE
INSTEAD
OF THREE OR FOUR WIDELY KNOWN LITERARY NAMES THE SOUTH OUGHT TO HAVE A
DOZEN OR TWO AND WILL HAVE THEM WHEN SIR WALTER'S TIME IS OUT
A CURIOUS EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE POWER OF A SINGLE BOOK FOR GOOD OR HARM
IS SHOWN IN THE EFFECTS WROUGHT BY 'DON QUIXOTE' AND THOSE WROUGHT
BY 'IVANHOE THE FIRST SWEPT THE WORLD'S ADMIRATION FOR THE MEDIEVAL
CHIVALRY SILLINESS OUT OF EXISTENCE AND THE OTHER RESTORED IT
AS FAR
AS OUR SOUTH IS CONCERNED THE GOOD WORK DONE BY CERVANTES IS PRETTY
NEARLY A DEAD LETTER SO EFFECTUALLY HAS SCOTT'S PERNICIOUS WORK
UNDERMINED IT
CHAPTER 47
UNCLE REMUS AND MR
CABLE
MR
JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS 'UNCLE REMUS' WAS TO ARRIVE FROM ATLANTA AT
SEVEN O'CLOCK SUNDAY MORNING SO WE GOT UP AND RECEIVED HIM
WE WERE
ABLE TO DETECT HIM AMONG THE CROWD OF ARRIVALS AT THE HOTEL COUNTER BY
HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH A DESCRIPTION OF HIM WHICH HAD BEEN FURNISHED US
FROM A TRUSTWORTHY SOURCE
HE WAS SAID TO BE UNDERSIZED RED HAIRED
AND SOMEWHAT FRECKLED
HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN THE PARTY WHOSE OUTSIDE
TALLIED WITH THIS BILL OF PARTICULARS
HE WAS SAID TO BE VERY SHY
HE
IS A SHY MAN
OF THIS THERE IS NO DOUBT
IT MAY NOT SHOW ON THE SURFACE
BUT THE SHYNESS IS THERE
AFTER DAYS OF INTIMACY ONE WONDERS TO SEE
THAT IT IS STILL IN ABOUT AS STRONG FORCE AS EVER
THERE IS A FINE AND
BEAUTIFUL NATURE HIDDEN BEHIND IT AS ALL KNOW WHO HAVE READ THE UNCLE
REMUS BOOK AND A FINE GENIUS TOO AS ALL KNOW BY THE SAME SIGN
I SEEM
TO BE TALKING QUITE FREELY ABOUT THIS NEIGHBOR BUT IN TALKING TO THE
PUBLIC I AM BUT TALKING TO HIS PERSONAL FRIENDS AND THESE THINGS ARE
PERMISSIBLE AMONG FRIENDS
HE DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED A NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO HAD FLOCKED EAGERLY TO
MR
CABLE'S HOUSE TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS SAGE AND ORACLE OF
THE NATION'S NURSERIES
THEY SAID
'WHY HE 'S WHITE
THEY WERE GRIEVED ABOUT IT
SO TO CONSOLE THEM THE BOOK WAS BROUGHT
THAT THEY MIGHT HEAR UNCLE REMUS'S TAR BABY STORY FROM THE LIPS OF UNCLE
REMUS HIMSELF OR WHAT IN THEIR OUTRAGED EYES WAS LEFT OF HIM
BUT IT
TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NEVER READ ALOUD TO PEOPLE AND WAS TOO SHY TO
VENTURE THE ATTEMPT NOW
MR
CABLE AND I READ FROM BOOKS OF OURS TO
SHOW HIM WHAT AN EASY TRICK IT WAS BUT HIS IMMORTAL SHYNESS WAS PROOF
AGAINST EVEN THIS SAGACIOUS STRATEGY SO WE HAD TO READ ABOUT BRER
RABBIT OURSELVES
MR
HARRIS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO READ THE NEGRO DIALECT BETTER THAN
ANYBODY ELSE FOR IN THE MATTER OF WRITING IT HE IS THE ONLY MASTER THE
COUNTRY HAS PRODUCED
MR
CABLE IS THE ONLY MASTER IN THE WRITING OF
FRENCH DIALECTS THAT THE COUNTRY HAS PRODUCED AND HE READS THEM
IN PERFECTION
IT WAS A GREAT TREAT TO HEAR HIM READ ABOUT JEAN AH
POQUELIN AND ABOUT INNERARITY AND HIS FAMOUS 'PIGSHOO' REPRESENTING
'LOUISIHANNA RIF FUSING TO HANTER THE UNION ALONG WITH PASSAGES OF
NICELY SHADED GERMAN DIALECT FROM A NOVEL WHICH WAS STILL IN MANUSCRIPT
IT CAME OUT IN CONVERSATION THAT IN TWO DIFFERENT INSTANCES MR
CABLE
GOT INTO GROTESQUE TROUBLE BY USING IN HIS BOOKS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
FRENCH NAMES WHICH NEVERTHELESS HAPPENED TO BE BORNE BY LIVING AND
SENSITIVE CITIZENS OF NEW ORLEANS
HIS NAMES WERE EITHER INVENTIONS OR
WERE BORROWED FROM THE ANCIENT AND OBSOLETE PAST I DO NOT NOW REMEMBER
WHICH BUT AT ANY RATE LIVING BEARERS OF THEM TURNED UP AND WERE A GOOD
DEAL HURT AT HAVING ATTENTION DIRECTED TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR AFFAIRS
IN SO EXCESSIVELY PUBLIC A MANNER
MR
WARNER AND I HAD AN EXPERIENCE OF THE SAME SORT WHEN WE WROTE
THE BOOK CALLED 'THE GILDED AGE THERE IS A CHARACTER IN IT CALLED
'SELLERS I DO NOT REMEMBER WHAT HIS FIRST NAME WAS IN THE BEGINNING
BUT ANYWAY MR
WARNER DID NOT LIKE IT AND WANTED IT IMPROVED
HE ASKED
ME IF I WAS ABLE TO IMAGINE A PERSON NAMED 'ESCHOL SELLERS OF COURSE I
SAID I COULD NOT WITHOUT STIMULANTS
HE SAID THAT AWAY OUT WEST ONCE
HE HAD MET AND CONTEMPLATED AND ACTUALLY SHAKEN HANDS WITH A MAN
BEARING THAT IMPOSSIBLE NAME 'ESCHOL SELLERS HE ADDED
'IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO HIS NAME HAS PROBABLY CARRIED HIM OFF BEFORE
THIS AND IF IT HASN'T HE WILL NEVER SEE THE BOOK ANYHOW
WE WILL
CONFISCATE HIS NAME
THE NAME YOU ARE USING IS COMMON AND THEREFORE
DANGEROUS THERE ARE PROBABLY A THOUSAND SELLERSES BEARING IT AND THE
WHOLE HORDE WILL COME AFTER US BUT ESCHOL SELLERS IS A SAFE NAME IT IS
A ROCK
SO WE BORROWED THAT NAME AND WHEN THE BOOK HAD BEEN OUT ABOUT A WEEK
ONE OF THE STATELIEST AND HANDSOMEST AND MOST ARISTOCRATIC LOOKING WHITE
MEN THAT EVER LIVED CALLED AROUND WITH THE MOST FORMIDABLE LIBEL
SUIT IN HIS POCKET THAT EVER WELL IN BRIEF WE GOT HIS PERMISSION TO
SUPPRESS AN EDITION OF TEN MILLION FOOTNOTE FIGURES TAKEN FROM MEMORY
AND PROBABLY INCORRECT
THINK IT WAS MORE COPIES OF THE BOOK AND
CHANGE THAT NAME TO 'MULBERRY SELLERS' IN FUTURE EDITIONS
CHAPTER 48
SUGAR AND POSTAGE
ONE DAY ON THE STREET I ENCOUNTERED THE MAN WHOM OF ALL MEN I MOST
WISHED TO SEE HORACE BIXBY FORMERLY PILOT UNDER ME OR RATHER OVER
ME NOW CAPTAIN OF THE GREAT STEAMER 'CITY OF BATON ROUGE THE LATEST
AND SWIFTEST ADDITION TO THE ANCHOR LINE
THE SAME SLENDER FIGURE THE
SAME TIGHT CURLS THE SAME SPRINGY STEP THE SAME ALERTNESS THE SAME
DECISION OF EYE AND ANSWERING DECISION OF HAND THE SAME ERECT MILITARY
BEARING NOT AN INCH GAINED OR LOST IN GIRTH NOT AN OUNCE GAINED OR
LOST IN WEIGHT NOT A HAIR TURNED
IT IS A CURIOUS THING TO LEAVE A MAN
THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND COME BACK AT THE END OF TWENTY ONE YEARS AND
FIND HIM STILL ONLY THIRTY FIVE
I HAVE NOT HAD AN EXPERIENCE OF THIS
KIND BEFORE I BELIEVE
THERE WERE SOME CROW'S FEET BUT THEY COUNTED
FOR NEXT TO NOTHING SINCE THEY WERE INCONSPICUOUS
HIS BOAT WAS JUST IN
I HAD BEEN WAITING SEVERAL DAYS FOR HER PURPOSING
TO RETURN TO ST
LOUIS IN HER
THE CAPTAIN AND I JOINED A PARTY OF
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN GUESTS OF MAJOR WOOD AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER
FIFTY FOUR MILES IN A SWIFT TUG TO EX GOVERNOR WARMOUTH'S SUGAR
PLANTATION
STRUNG ALONG BELOW THE CITY WERE A NUMBER OF DECAYED
RAM SHACKLY SUPERANNUATED OLD STEAMBOATS NOT ONE OF WHICH HAD I EVER
SEEN BEFORE
THEY HAD ALL BEEN BUILT AND WORN OUT AND THROWN ASIDE
SINCE I WAS HERE LAST
THIS GIVES ONE A REALIZING SENSE OF THE FRAILNESS
OF A MISSISSIPPI BOAT AND THE BRIEFNESS OF ITS LIFE
SIX MILES BELOW TOWN A FAT AND BATTERED BRICK CHIMNEY STICKING ABOVE
THE MAGNOLIAS AND LIVE OAKS WAS POINTED OUT AS THE MONUMENT ERECTED BY
AN APPRECIATIVE NATION TO CELEBRATE THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS JACKSON'S
VICTORY OVER THE BRITISH JANUARY 8 1815
THE WAR HAD ENDED THE TWO
NATIONS WERE AT PEACE BUT THE NEWS HAD NOT YET REACHED NEW ORLEANS
IF
WE HAD HAD THE CABLE TELEGRAPH IN THOSE DAYS THIS BLOOD WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN SPILT THOSE LIVES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WASTED AND BETTER STILL
JACKSON WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT
WE HAVE GOTTEN OVER
THE HARMS DONE US BY THE WAR OF 1812 BUT NOT OVER SOME OF THOSE DONE US
BY JACKSON'S PRESIDENCY
THE WARMOUTH PLANTATION COVERS A VAST DEAL OF GROUND AND THE
HOSPITALITY OF THE WARMOUTH MANSION IS GRADUATED TO THE SAME LARGE
SCALE
WE SAW STEAM PLOWS AT WORK HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE
TRACTION ENGINE TRAVELS ABOUT ON ITS OWN WHEELS TILL IT REACHES THE
REQUIRED SPOT THEN IT STANDS STILL AND BY MEANS OF A WIRE ROPE PULLS
THE HUGE PLOW TOWARD ITSELF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS ACROSS THE FIELD
BETWEEN THE ROWS OF CANE
THE THING CUTS DOWN INTO THE BLACK MOLD A FOOT
AND A HALF DEEP
THE PLOW LOOKS LIKE A FORE AND AFT BRACE OF A HUDSON
RIVER STEAMER INVERTED
WHEN THE NEGRO STEERSMAN SITS ON ONE END OF IT
THAT END TILTS DOWN NEAR THE GROUND WHILE THE OTHER STICKS UP HIGH IN
AIR
THIS GREAT SEE SAW GOES ROLLING AND PITCHING LIKE A SHIP AT SEA
AND IT IS NOT EVERY CIRCUS RIDER THAT COULD STAY ON IT
THE PLANTATION CONTAINS TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ACRES SIX HUNDRED AND
FIFTY ARE IN CANE AND THERE IS A FRUITFUL ORANGE GROVE OF FIVE THOUSAND
TREES
THE CANE IS CULTIVATED AFTER A MODERN AND INTRICATE SCIENTIFIC
FASHION TOO ELABORATE AND COMPLEX FOR ME TO ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE BUT IT
LOST 40 000 LAST YEAR
I FORGET THE OTHER DETAILS
HOWEVER THIS YEAR'S
CROP WILL REACH TEN OR TWELVE HUNDRED TONS OF SUGAR CONSEQUENTLY LAST
YEAR'S LOSS WILL NOT MATTER
THESE TROUBLESOME AND EXPENSIVE SCIENTIFIC
METHODS ACHIEVE A YIELD OF A TON AND A HALF AND FROM THAT TO TWO TONS
TO THE ACRE WHICH IS THREE OR FOUR TIMES WHAT THE YIELD OF AN ACRE WAS
IN MY TIME
THE DRAINAGE DITCHES WERE EVERYWHERE ALIVE WITH LITTLE
CRABS 'FIDDLERS ONE SAW THEM SCAMPERING SIDEWISE IN EVERY DIRECTION
WHENEVER THEY HEARD A DISTURBING NOISE
EXPENSIVE PESTS THESE CRABS
FOR THEY BORE INTO THE LEVEES AND RUIN THEM
THE GREAT SUGAR HOUSE WAS A WILDERNESS OF TUBS AND TANKS AND VATS AND
FILTERS PUMPS PIPES AND MACHINERY
THE PROCESS OF MAKING SUGAR
IS EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING
FIRST YOU HEAVE YOUR CANE INTO THE
CENTRIFUGALS AND GRIND OUT THE JUICE THEN RUN IT THROUGH THE
EVAPORATING PAN TO EXTRACT THE FIBER THEN THROUGH THE BONE FILTER TO
REMOVE THE ALCOHOL THEN THROUGH THE CLARIFYING TANKS TO DISCHARGE THE
MOLASSES THEN THROUGH THE GRANULATING PIPE TO CONDENSE IT THEN THROUGH
THE VACUUM PAN TO EXTRACT THE VACUUM
IT IS NOW READY FOR MARKET
I HAVE
JOTTED THESE PARTICULARS DOWN FROM MEMORY
THE THING LOOKS SIMPLE AND
EASY
DO NOT DECEIVE YOURSELF
TO MAKE SUGAR IS REALLY ONE OF THE
MOST DIFFICULT THINGS IN THE WORLD
AND TO MAKE IT RIGHT IS NEXT TO
IMPOSSIBLE
IF YOU WILL EXAMINE YOUR OWN SUPPLY EVERY NOW AND THEN FOR
A TERM OF YEARS AND TABULATE THE RESULT YOU WILL FIND THAT NOT TWO MEN
IN TWENTY CAN MAKE SUGAR WITHOUT GETTING SAND INTO IT
WE COULD HAVE GONE DOWN TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AND VISITED CAPTAIN
EADS' GREAT WORK THE 'JETTIES WHERE THE RIVER HAS BEEN COMPRESSED
BETWEEN WALLS AND THUS DEEPENED TO TWENTY SIX FEET BUT IT WAS VOTED
USELESS TO GO SINCE AT THIS STAGE OF THE WATER EVERYTHING WOULD BE
COVERED UP AND INVISIBLE
WE COULD HAVE VISITED THAT ANCIENT AND SINGULAR BURG 'PILOT TOWN
WHICH STANDS ON STILTS IN THE WATER SO THEY SAY WHERE NEARLY ALL
COMMUNICATION IS BY SKIFF AND CANOE EVEN TO THE ATTENDING OF WEDDINGS
AND FUNERALS AND WHERE THE LITTLEST BOYS AND GIRLS ARE AS HANDY WITH
THE OAR AS UNAMPHIBIOUS CHILDREN ARE WITH THE VELOCIPEDE
WE COULD HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS BUT ON ACCOUNT OF LIMITED
TIME WE WENT BACK HOME
THE SAIL UP THE BREEZY AND SPARKLING RIVER WAS
A CHARMING EXPERIENCE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFYINGLY SENTIMENTAL
AND ROMANTIC BUT FOR THE INTERRUPTIONS OF THE TUG'S PET PARROT
WHOSE TIRELESS COMMENTS UPON THE SCENERY AND THE GUESTS WERE ALWAYS
THIS WORLDLY AND OFTEN PROFANE
HE HAD ALSO A SUPERABUNDANCE OF
THE DISCORDANT EAR SPLITTING METALLIC LAUGH COMMON TO HIS BREED A
MACHINE MADE LAUGH A FRANKENSTEIN LAUGH WITH THE SOUL LEFT OUT OF IT
HE APPLIED IT TO EVERY SENTIMENTAL REMARK AND TO EVERY PATHETIC SONG
HE CACKLED IT OUT WITH HIDEOUS ENERGY AFTER 'HOME AGAIN HOME AGAIN FROM
A FOREIGN SHORE AND SAID HE 'WOULDN'T GIVE A DAMN FOR A TUG LOAD
OF SUCH ROT ROMANCE AND SENTIMENT CANNOT LONG SURVIVE THIS SORT OF
DISCOURAGEMENT SO THE SINGING AND TALKING PRESENTLY CEASED WHICH SO
DELIGHTED THE PARROT THAT HE CURSED HIMSELF HOARSE FOR JOY
THEN THE MALE MEMBERS OF THE PARTY MOVED TO THE FORECASTLE TO SMOKE AND
GOSSIP
THERE WERE SEVERAL OLD STEAMBOATMEN ALONG AND I LEARNED FROM
THEM A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING TO MY FORMER RIVER FRIENDS
DURING MY LONG ABSENCE
I LEARNED THAT A PILOT WHOM I USED TO STEER
FOR IS BECOME A SPIRITUALIST AND FOR MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS HAS BEEN
RECEIVING A LETTER EVERY WEEK FROM A DECEASED RELATIVE THROUGH A
NEW YORK SPIRITUALIST MEDIUM NAMED MANCHESTER POSTAGE GRADUATED BY
DISTANCE FROM THE LOCAL POST OFFICE IN PARADISE TO NEW YORK FIVE
DOLLARS FROM NEW YORK TO ST
LOUIS THREE CENTS
I REMEMBER MR
MANCHESTER VERY WELL
I CALLED ON HIM ONCE TEN YEARS AGO WITH A COUPLE
OF FRIENDS ONE OF WHOM WISHED TO INQUIRE AFTER A DECEASED UNCLE
THIS
UNCLE HAD LOST HIS LIFE IN A PECULIARLY VIOLENT AND UNUSUAL WAY HALF
A DOZEN YEARS BEFORE A CYCLONE BLEW HIM SOME THREE MILES AND KNOCKED
A TREE DOWN WITH HIM WHICH WAS FOUR FEET THROUGH AT THE BUTT AND
SIXTY FIVE FEET HIGH
HE DID NOT SURVIVE THIS TRIUMPH
AT THE SEANCE
JUST REFERRED TO MY FRIEND QUESTIONED HIS LATE UNCLE THROUGH MR
MANCHESTER AND THE LATE UNCLE WROTE DOWN HIS REPLIES USING MR
MANCHESTER'S HAND AND PENCIL FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE FOLLOWING IS A FAIR
EXAMPLE OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED AND ALSO OF THE SLOPPY TWADDLE IN THE
WAY OF ANSWERS FURNISHED BY MANCHESTER UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT IT CAME
FROM THE SPECTER
IF THIS MAN IS NOT THE PALTRIEST FRAUD THAT LIVES I
OWE HIM AN APOLOGY
QUESTION
WHERE ARE YOU
ANSWER
IN THE SPIRIT WORLD
Q
ARE YOU HAPPY
A
VERY HAPPY
PERFECTLY HAPPY
Q
HOW DO YOU AMUSE YOURSELF
A
CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS AND OTHER SPIRITS
Q
WHAT ELSE
A
NOTHING ELSE
NOTHING ELSE IS NECESSARY
Q
WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT
A
ABOUT HOW HAPPY WE ARE AND ABOUT FRIENDS LEFT BEHIND IN THE EARTH
AND HOW TO INFLUENCE THEM FOR THEIR GOOD
Q
WHEN YOUR FRIENDS IN THE EARTH ALL GET TO THE SPIRIT LAND WHAT SHALL
YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THEN NOTHING BUT ABOUT HOW HAPPY YOU ALL ARE
NO REPLY
IT IS EXPLAINED THAT SPIRITS WILL NOT ANSWER FRIVOLOUS
QUESTIONS
Q
HOW IS IT THAT SPIRITS THAT ARE CONTENT TO SPEND AN ETERNITY IN
FRIVOLOUS EMPLOYMENTS AND ACCEPT IT AS HAPPINESS ARE SO FASTIDIOUS
ABOUT FRIVOLOUS QUESTIONS UPON THE SUBJECT
NO REPLY
Q
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME BACK
A
NO
Q
WOULD YOU SAY THAT UNDER OATH
A
YES
Q
WHAT DO YOU EAT THERE
A
WE DO NOT EAT
Q
WHAT DO YOU DRINK
A
WE DO NOT DRINK
Q
WHAT DO YOU SMOKE
A
WE DO NOT SMOKE
Q
WHAT DO YOU READ
A
WE DO NOT READ
Q
DO ALL THE GOOD PEOPLE GO TO YOUR PLACE
A
YES
Q
YOU KNOW MY PRESENT WAY OF LIFE
CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY ADDITIONS TO IT
IN THE WAY OF CRIME THAT WILL REASONABLY INSURE MY GOING TO SOME OTHER
PLACE
A
NO REPLY
Q
WHEN DID YOU DIE
A
I DID NOT DIE I PASSED AWAY
Q
VERY WELL THEN WHEN DID YOU PASS AWAY HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN
THE SPIRIT LAND
A
WE HAVE NO MEASUREMENTS OF TIME HERE
Q
THOUGH YOU MAY BE INDIFFERENT AND UNCERTAIN AS TO DATES AND TIMES IN
YOUR PRESENT CONDITION AND ENVIRONMENT THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR
FORMER CONDITION
YOU HAD DATES THEN
ONE OF THESE IS WHAT I ASK FOR
YOU DEPARTED ON A CERTAIN DAY IN A CERTAIN YEAR
IS NOT THIS TRUE
A
YES
Q
THEN NAME THE DAY OF THE MONTH
MUCH FUMBLING WITH PENCIL ON THE PART OF THE MEDIUM ACCOMPANIED BY
VIOLENT SPASMODIC JERKINGS OF HIS HEAD AND BODY FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
FINALLY EXPLANATION TO THE EFFECT THAT SPIRITS OFTEN FORGET DATES SUCH
THINGS BEING WITHOUT IMPORTANCE TO THEM
Q
THEN THIS ONE HAS ACTUALLY FORGOTTEN THE DATE OF ITS TRANSLATION TO
THE SPIRIT LAND
THIS WAS GRANTED TO BE THE CASE
Q
THIS IS VERY CURIOUS
WELL THEN WHAT YEAR WAS IT
MORE FUMBLING JERKING IDIOTIC SPASMS ON THE PART OF THE MEDIUM
FINALLY EXPLANATION TO THE EFFECT THAT THE SPIRIT HAS FORGOTTEN THE
YEAR
Q
THIS IS INDEED STUPENDOUS
LET ME PUT ONE MORE QUESTION ONE LAST
QUESTION TO YOU BEFORE WE PART TO MEET NO MORE FOR EVEN IF I FAIL
TO AVOID YOUR ASYLUM A MEETING THERE WILL GO FOR NOTHING AS A MEETING
SINCE BY THAT TIME YOU WILL EASILY HAVE FORGOTTEN ME AND MY NAME DID
YOU DIE A NATURAL DEATH OR WERE YOU CUT OFF BY A CATASTROPHE
A
AFTER LONG HESITATION AND MANY THROES AND SPASMS NATURAL DEATH
THIS ENDED THE INTERVIEW
MY FRIEND TOLD THE MEDIUM THAT WHEN HIS
RELATIVE WAS IN THIS POOR WORLD HE WAS ENDOWED WITH AN EXTRAORDINARY
INTELLECT AND AN ABSOLUTELY DEFECTLESS MEMORY AND IT SEEMED A GREAT
PITY THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP SOME SHRED OF THESE FOR
HIS AMUSEMENT IN THE REALMS OF EVERLASTING CONTENTMENT AND FOR THE
AMAZEMENT AND ADMIRATION OF THE REST OF THE POPULATION THERE
THIS MAN HAD PLENTY OF CLIENTS HAS PLENTY YET
HE RECEIVES LETTERS FROM
SPIRITS LOCATED IN EVERY PART OF THE SPIRIT WORLD AND DELIVERS THEM
ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY THROUGH THE UNITED STATES MAIL
THESE LETTERS ARE
FILLED WITH ADVICE ADVICE FROM 'SPIRITS' WHO DON'T KNOW AS MUCH AS A

OF THESE CLIENTS WAS A MAN WHOM THE SPIRITS IF ONE MAY THUS PLURALLY

CHAPTER 49
EPISODES IN PILOT LIFE
IN THE COURSE OF THE TUG BOAT GOSSIP IT CAME OUT THAT OUT OF EVERY FIVE
OF MY FORMER FRIENDS WHO HAD QUITTED THE RIVER FOUR HAD CHOSEN FARMING
AS AN OCCUPATION
OF COURSE THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE THEY WERE PECULIARLY
GIFTED AGRICULTURALLY AND THUS MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED AS FARMERS THAN
IN OTHER INDUSTRIES THE REASON FOR THEIR CHOICE MUST BE TRACED TO SOME
OTHER SOURCE
DOUBTLESS THEY CHOSE FARMING BECAUSE THAT LIFE IS
PRIVATE AND SECLUDED FROM IRRUPTIONS OF UNDESIRABLE STRANGERS LIKE THE
PILOT HOUSE HERMITAGE
AND DOUBTLESS THEY ALSO CHOSE IT BECAUSE ON A
THOUSAND NIGHTS OF BLACK STORM AND DANGER THEY HAD NOTED THE TWINKLING
LIGHTS OF SOLITARY FARM HOUSES AS THE BOAT SWUNG BY AND PICTURED TO
THEMSELVES THE SERENITY AND SECURITY AND COZINESS OF SUCH REFUGES AT
SUCH TIMES AND SO HAD BY AND BYE COME TO DREAM OF THAT RETIRED AND
PEACEFUL LIFE AS THE ONE DESIRABLE THING TO LONG FOR ANTICIPATE EARN
AND AT LAST ENJOY
BUT I DID NOT LEARN THAT ANY OF THESE PILOT FARMERS HAD ASTONISHED
ANYBODY WITH THEIR SUCCESSES
THEIR FARMS DO NOT SUPPORT THEM THEY
SUPPORT THEIR FARMS
THE PILOT FARMER DISAPPEARS FROM THE RIVER
ANNUALLY ABOUT THE BREAKING OF SPRING AND IS SEEN NO MORE TILL NEXT
FROST
THEN HE APPEARS AGAIN IN DAMAGED HOMESPUN COMBS THE HAYSEED OUT
OF HIS HAIR AND TAKES A PILOT HOUSE BERTH FOR THE WINTER
IN THIS WAY
HE PAYS THE DEBTS WHICH HIS FARMING HAS ACHIEVED DURING THE AGRICULTURAL
SEASON
SO HIS RIVER BONDAGE IS BUT HALF BROKEN HE IS STILL THE RIVER'S
SLAVE THE HARDEST HALF OF THE YEAR
ONE OF THESE MEN BOUGHT A FARM BUT DID NOT RETIRE TO IT
HE KNEW A
TRICK WORTH TWO OF THAT
HE DID NOT PROPOSE TO PAUPERIZE HIS FARM BY
APPLYING HIS PERSONAL IGNORANCE TO WORKING IT
NO HE PUT THE FARM INTO
THE HANDS OF AN AGRICULTURAL EXPERT TO BE WORKED ON SHARES OUT OF EVERY
THREE LOADS OF CORN THE EXPERT TO HAVE TWO AND THE PILOT THE THIRD
BUT AT THE END OF THE SEASON THE PILOT RECEIVED NO CORN
THE EXPERT
EXPLAINED THAT HIS SHARE WAS NOT REACHED
THE FARM PRODUCED ONLY TWO
LOADS
SOME OF THE PILOTS WHOM I HAD KNOWN HAD HAD ADVENTURES THE OUTCOME
FORTUNATE SOMETIMES BUT NOT IN ALL CASES
CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY WHOM I
HAD STEERED FOR WHEN HE WAS A PILOT COMMANDED THE CONFEDERATE FLEET
IN THE GREAT BATTLE BEFORE MEMPHIS WHEN HIS VESSEL WENT DOWN HE SWAM
ASHORE FOUGHT HIS WAY THROUGH A SQUAD OF SOLDIERS AND MADE A GALLANT
AND NARROW ESCAPE
HE WAS ALWAYS A COOL MAN NOTHING COULD DISTURB
HIS SERENITY
ONCE WHEN HE WAS CAPTAIN OF THE 'CRESCENT CITY I WAS
BRINGING THE BOAT INTO PORT AT NEW ORLEANS AND MOMENTLY EXPECTING
ORDERS FROM THE HURRICANE DECK BUT RECEIVED NONE
I HAD STOPPED
THE WHEELS AND THERE MY AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY CEASED
IT WAS
EVENING DIM TWILIGHT THE CAPTAIN'S HAT WAS PERCHED UPON THE BIG BELL
AND I SUPPOSED THE INTELLECTUAL END OF THE CAPTAIN WAS IN IT BUT SUCH
WAS NOT THE CASE
THE CAPTAIN WAS VERY STRICT THEREFORE I KNEW BETTER
THAN TO TOUCH A BELL WITHOUT ORDERS
MY DUTY WAS TO HOLD THE BOAT
STEADILY ON HER CALAMITOUS COURSE AND LEAVE THE CONSEQUENCES TO TAKE
CARE OF THEMSELVES WHICH I DID
SO WE WENT PLOWING PAST THE STERNS OF
STEAMBOATS AND GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER THE CRASH WAS BOUND TO COME
VERY SOON AND STILL THAT HAT NEVER BUDGED FOR ALAS THE CAPTAIN WAS
NAPPING IN THE TEXAS
THINGS WERE BECOMING EXCEEDINGLY NERVOUS AND
UNCOMFORTABLE
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS NOT GOING TO APPEAR
IN TIME TO SEE THE ENTERTAINMENT
BUT HE DID
JUST AS WE WERE WALKING
INTO THE STERN OF A STEAMBOAT HE STEPPED OUT ON DECK AND SAID WITH
HEAVENLY SERENITY 'SET HER BACK ON BOTH' WHICH I DID BUT A TRIFLE
LATE HOWEVER FOR THE NEXT MOMENT WE WENT SMASHING THROUGH THAT OTHER
BOAT'S FLIMSY OUTER WORKS WITH A MOST PRODIGIOUS RACKET
THE CAPTAIN
NEVER SAID A WORD TO ME ABOUT THE MATTER AFTERWARDS EXCEPT TO REMARK
THAT I HAD DONE RIGHT AND THAT HE HOPED I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO ACT IN
THE SAME WAY AGAIN IN LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES
ONE OF THE PILOTS WHOM I HAD KNOWN WHEN I WAS ON THE RIVER HAD DIED A
VERY HONORABLE DEATH
HIS BOAT CAUGHT FIRE AND HE REMAINED AT THE WHEEL
UNTIL HE GOT HER SAFE TO LAND
THEN HE WENT OUT OVER THE BREAST BOARD
WITH HIS CLOTHING IN FLAMES AND WAS THE LAST PERSON TO GET ASHORE
HE
DIED FROM HIS INJURIES IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR THREE HOURS AND HIS WAS
THE ONLY LIFE LOST
THE HISTORY OF MISSISSIPPI PILOTING AFFORDS SIX OR SEVEN INSTANCES OF
THIS SORT OF MARTYRDOM AND HALF A HUNDRED INSTANCES OF ESCAPES FROM A
LIKE FATE WHICH CAME WITHIN A SECOND OR TWO OF BEING FATALLY TOO LATE
BUT THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF A PILOT DESERTING HIS POST TO SAVE HIS LIFE
WHILE BY REMAINING AND SACRIFICING IT HE MIGHT SECURE OTHER LIVES FROM
DESTRUCTION IT IS WELL WORTH WHILE TO SET DOWN THIS NOBLE FACT AND
WELL WORTH WHILE TO PUT IT IN ITALICS TOO
THE 'CUB' PILOT IS EARLY ADMONISHED TO DESPISE ALL PERILS CONNECTED WITH
A PILOT'S CALLING AND TO PREFER ANY SORT OF DEATH TO THE DEEP DISHONOR
OF DESERTING HIS POST WHILE THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF HIS BEING USEFUL
IN IT
AND SO EFFECTIVELY ARE THESE ADMONITIONS INCULCATED THAT EVEN
YOUNG AND BUT HALF TRIED PILOTS CAN BE DEPENDED UPON TO STICK TO THE
WHEEL AND DIE THERE WHEN OCCASION REQUIRES
IN A MEMPHIS GRAVEYARD IS
BURIED A YOUNG FELLOW WHO PERISHED AT THE WHEEL A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO
IN WHITE RIVER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF OTHER MEN
HE SAID TO THE CAPTAIN
THAT IF THE FIRE WOULD GIVE HIM TIME TO REACH A SAND BAR SOME DISTANCE
AWAY ALL COULD BE SAVED BUT THAT TO LAND AGAINST THE BLUFF BANK OF THE
RIVER WOULD BE TO INSURE THE LOSS OF MANY LIVES
HE REACHED THE BAR
AND GROUNDED THE BOAT IN SHALLOW WATER BUT BY THAT TIME THE FLAMES HAD
CLOSED AROUND HIM AND IN ESCAPING THROUGH THEM HE WAS FATALLY BURNED
HE HAD BEEN URGED TO FLY SOONER BUT HAD REPLIED AS BECAME A PILOT TO
REPLY
'I WILL NOT GO
IF I GO NOBODY WILL BE SAVED IF I STAY NO ONE WILL BE
LOST BUT ME
I WILL STAY
THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED PERSONS ON BOARD AND NO LIFE WAS LOST BUT THE
PILOT'S
THERE USED TO BE A MONUMENT TO THIS YOUNG FELLOW IN THAT
MEMPHIS GRAVEYARD
WHILE WE TARRIED IN MEMPHIS ON OUR DOWN TRIP I
STARTED OUT TO LOOK FOR IT BUT OUR TIME WAS SO BRIEF THAT I WAS OBLIGED
TO TURN BACK BEFORE MY OBJECT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
THE TUG BOAT GOSSIP INFORMED ME THAT DICK KENNET WAS DEAD BLOWN UP
NEAR MEMPHIS AND KILLED THAT SEVERAL OTHERS WHOM I HAD KNOWN HAD
FALLEN IN THE WAR ONE OR TWO OF THEM SHOT DOWN AT THE WHEEL THAT
ANOTHER AND VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND WHOM I HAD STEERED MANY TRIPS FOR
HAD STEPPED OUT OF HIS HOUSE IN NEW ORLEANS ONE NIGHT YEARS AGO TO
COLLECT SOME MONEY IN A REMOTE PART OF THE CITY AND HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN
AGAIN WAS MURDERED AND THROWN INTO THE RIVER IT WAS THOUGHT THAT BEN
THORNBURGH WAS DEAD LONG AGO ALSO HIS WILD 'CUB' WHOM I USED TO QUARREL
WITH ALL THROUGH EVERY DAYLIGHT WATCH
A HEEDLESS RECKLESS CREATURE HE
WAS AND ALWAYS IN HOT WATER ALWAYS IN MISCHIEF
AN ARKANSAS PASSENGER
BROUGHT AN ENORMOUS BEAR ABOARD ONE DAY AND CHAINED HIM TO A LIFE BOAT
ON THE HURRICANE DECK
THORNBURGH'S 'CUB' COULD NOT REST TILL HE HAD
GONE THERE AND UNCHAINED THE BEAR TO 'SEE WHAT HE WOULD DO HE WAS
PROMPTLY GRATIFIED
THE BEAR CHASED HIM AROUND AND AROUND THE DECK
FOR MILES AND MILES WITH TWO HUNDRED EAGER FACES GRINNING THROUGH THE
RAILINGS FOR AUDIENCE AND FINALLY SNATCHED OFF THE LAD'S COAT TAIL AND
WENT INTO THE TEXAS TO CHEW IT
THE OFF WATCH TURNED OUT WITH ALACRITY
AND LEFT THE BEAR IN SOLE POSSESSION
HE PRESENTLY GREW LONESOME AND
STARTED OUT FOR RECREATION
HE RANGED THE WHOLE BOAT VISITED EVERY PART
OF IT WITH AN ADVANCE GUARD OF FLEEING PEOPLE IN FRONT OF HIM AND A
VOICELESS VACANCY BEHIND HIM AND WHEN HIS OWNER CAPTURED HIM AT LAST
THOSE TWO WERE THE ONLY VISIBLE BEINGS ANYWHERE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS IN
HIDING AND THE BOAT WAS A SOLITUDE
I WAS TOLD THAT ONE OF MY PILOT FRIENDS FELL DEAD AT THE WHEEL FROM
HEART DISEASE IN 1869
THE CAPTAIN WAS ON THE ROOF AT THE TIME
HE SAW
THE BOAT BREAKING FOR THE SHORE SHOUTED AND GOT NO ANSWER RAN UP AND
FOUND THE PILOT LYING DEAD ON THE FLOOR
MR
BIXBY HAD BEEN BLOWN UP IN MADRID BEND WAS NOT INJURED BUT THE
OTHER PILOT WAS LOST
GEORGE RITCHIE HAD BEEN BLOWN UP NEAR MEMPHIS BLOWN INTO THE RIVER FROM
THE WHEEL AND DISABLED
THE WATER WAS VERY COLD HE CLUNG TO A COTTON
BALE MAINLY WITH HIS TEETH AND FLOATED UNTIL NEARLY EXHAUSTED WHEN
HE WAS RESCUED BY SOME DECK HANDS WHO WERE ON A PIECE OF THE WRECK
THEY
TORE OPEN THE BALE AND PACKED HIM IN THE COTTON AND WARMED THE LIFE
BACK INTO HIM AND GOT HIM SAFE TO MEMPHIS
HE IS ONE OF BIXBY'S PILOTS
ON THE 'BATON ROUGE' NOW
INTO THE LIFE OF A STEAMBOAT CLERK NOW DEAD HAD DROPPED A BIT OF
ROMANCE SOMEWHAT GROTESQUE ROMANCE BUT ROMANCE NEVERTHELESS
WHEN I
KNEW HIM HE WAS A SHIFTLESS YOUNG SPENDTHRIFT BOISTEROUS GOODHEARTED
FULL OF CARELESS GENEROSITIES AND PRETTY CONSPICUOUSLY PROMISING TO
FOOL HIS POSSIBILITIES AWAY EARLY AND COME TO NOTHING
IN A WESTERN
CITY LIVED A RICH AND CHILDLESS OLD FOREIGNER AND HIS WIFE AND IN THEIR
FAMILY WAS A COMELY YOUNG GIRL SORT OF FRIEND SORT OF SERVANT
THE
YOUNG CLERK OF WHOM I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WHOSE NAME WAS NOT GEORGE
JOHNSON BUT WHO SHALL BE CALLED GEORGE JOHNSON FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS
NARRATIVE GOT ACQUAINTED WITH THIS YOUNG GIRL AND THEY SINNED AND
THE OLD FOREIGNER FOUND THEM OUT AND REBUKED THEM
BEING ASHAMED THEY
LIED AND SAID THEY WERE MARRIED THAT THEY HAD BEEN PRIVATELY MARRIED
THEN THE OLD FOREIGNER'S HURT WAS HEALED AND HE FORGAVE AND BLESSED
THEM
AFTER THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR SIN WITHOUT
CONCEALMENT
BY AND BYE THE FOREIGNER'S WIFE DIED AND PRESENTLY HE
FOLLOWED AFTER HER
FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY ASSEMBLED TO MOURN AND AMONG
THE MOURNERS SAT THE TWO YOUNG SINNERS
THE WILL WAS OPENED AND SOLEMNLY
READ
IT BEQUEATHED EVERY PENNY OF THAT OLD MAN'S GREAT WEALTH TO MRS
GEORGE JOHNSON
AND THERE WAS NO SUCH PERSON
THE YOUNG SINNERS FLED FORTH THEN AND DID
A VERY FOOLISH THING MARRIED THEMSELVES BEFORE AN OBSCURE JUSTICE OF
THE PEACE AND GOT HIM TO ANTEDATE THE THING
THAT DID NO SORT OF GOOD
THE DISTANT RELATIVES FLOCKED IN AND EXPOSED THE FRAUDFUL DATE WITH
EXTREME SUDDENNESS AND SURPRISING EASE AND CARRIED OFF THE FORTUNE
LEAVING THE JOHNSONS VERY LEGITIMATELY AND LEGALLY AND IRREVOCABLY
CHAINED TOGETHER IN HONORABLE MARRIAGE BUT WITH NOT SO MUCH AS A PENNY
TO BLESS THEMSELVES WITHAL
SUCH ARE THE ACTUAL FACTS AND NOT ALL
NOVELS HAVE FOR A BASE SO TELLING A SITUATION
CHAPTER 50
THE 'ORIGINAL JACOBS'
WE HAD SOME TALK ABOUT CAPTAIN ISAIAH SELLERS NOW MANY YEARS DEAD
HE
WAS A FINE MAN A HIGH MINDED MAN AND GREATLY RESPECTED BOTH ASHORE AND
ON THE RIVER
HE WAS VERY TALL WELL BUILT AND HANDSOME AND IN HIS OLD
AGE AS I REMEMBER HIM HIS HAIR WAS AS BLACK AS AN INDIAN'S AND HIS
EYE AND HAND WERE AS STRONG AND STEADY AND HIS NERVE AND JUDGMENT AS
FIRM AND CLEAR AS ANYBODY'S YOUNG OR OLD AMONG THE FRATERNITY OF
PILOTS
HE WAS THE PATRIARCH OF THE CRAFT HE HAD BEEN A KEELBOAT PILOT
BEFORE THE DAY OF STEAMBOATS AND A STEAMBOAT PILOT BEFORE ANY OTHER
STEAMBOAT PILOT STILL SURVIVING AT THE TIME I SPEAK OF HAD EVER TURNED
A WHEEL
CONSEQUENTLY HIS BRETHREN HELD HIM IN THE SORT OF AWE IN
WHICH ILLUSTRIOUS SURVIVORS OF A BYGONE AGE ARE ALWAYS HELD BY THEIR
ASSOCIATES
HE KNEW HOW HE WAS REGARDED AND PERHAPS THIS FACT ADDED
SOME TRIFLE OF STIFFENING TO HIS NATURAL DIGNITY WHICH HAD BEEN
SUFFICIENTLY STIFF IN ITS ORIGINAL STATE
HE LEFT A DIARY BEHIND HIM BUT APPARENTLY IT DID NOT DATE BACK TO HIS
FIRST STEAMBOAT TRIP WHICH WAS SAID TO BE 1811 THE YEAR THE FIRST
STEAMBOAT DISTURBED THE WATERS OF THE MISSISSIPPI
AT THE TIME OF HIS
DEATH A CORRESPONDENT OF THE 'ST
LOUIS REPUBLICAN' CULLED THE FOLLOWING
ITEMS FROM THE DIARY
'IN FEBRUARY 1825 HE SHIPPED ON BOARD THE STEAMER RAMBLER AT
FLORENCE ALA AND MADE DURING THAT YEAR THREE TRIPS TO NEW ORLEANS AND
BACK THIS ON THE GEN
CARROL BETWEEN NASHVILLE AND NEW ORLEANS
IT
WAS DURING HIS STAY ON THIS BOAT THAT CAPTAIN SELLERS INTRODUCED THE TAP
OF THE BELL AS A SIGNAL TO HEAVE THE LEAD PREVIOUS TO WHICH TIME IT WAS
THE CUSTOM FOR THE PILOT TO SPEAK TO THE MEN BELOW WHEN SOUNDINGS WERE
WANTED
THE PROXIMITY OF THE FORECASTLE TO THE PILOT HOUSE NO DOUBT
RENDERED THIS AN EASY MATTER BUT HOW DIFFERENT ON ONE OF OUR PALACES OF
THE PRESENT DAY
'IN 1827 WE FIND HIM ON BOARD THE PRESIDENT A BOAT OF TWO HUNDRED AND
EIGHTY FIVE TONS BURDEN AND PLYING BETWEEN SMITHLAND AND NEW ORLEANS
THENCE HE JOINED THE JUBILEE IN 1828 AND ON THIS BOAT HE DID HIS
FIRST PILOTING IN THE ST
LOUIS TRADE HIS FIRST WATCH EXTENDING FROM
HERCULANEUM TO ST
GENEVIEVE
ON MAY 26 1836 HE COMPLETED AND LEFT
PITTSBURGH IN CHARGE OF THE STEAMER PRAIRIE A BOAT OF FOUR HUNDRED
TONS AND THE FIRST STEAMER WITH A STATE ROOM CABIN EVER SEEN AT ST
LOUIS
IN 1857 HE INTRODUCED THE SIGNAL FOR MEETING BOATS AND WHICH
HAS WITH SOME SLIGHT CHANGE BEEN THE UNIVERSAL CUSTOM OF THIS DAY IN
FACT IS RENDERED OBLIGATORY BY ACT OF CONGRESS
'AS GENERAL ITEMS OF RIVER HISTORY WE QUOTE THE FOLLOWING MARGINAL
NOTES FROM HIS GENERAL LOG
'IN MARCH 1825 GEN
LAFAYETTE LEFT NEW ORLEANS FOR ST
LOUIS ON THE
LOW PRESSURE STEAMER NATCHEZ
'IN JANUARY 1828 TWENTY ONE STEAMERS LEFT THE NEW ORLEANS WHARF TO
CELEBRATE THE OCCASION OF GEN
JACKSON'S VISIT TO THAT CITY
'IN 1830 THE NORTH AMERICAN MADE THE RUN FROM NEW ORLEANS TO MEMPHIS
IN SIX DAYS BEST TIME ON RECORD TO THAT DATE
IT HAS SINCE BEEN MADE IN
TWO DAYS AND TEN HOURS
'IN 1831 THE RED RIVER CUT OFF FORMED
'IN 1832 STEAMER HUDSON MADE THE RUN FROM WHITE RIVER TO HELENA A
DISTANCE OF SEVENTY FIVE MILES IN TWELVE HOURS
THIS WAS THE SOURCE OF
MUCH TALK AND SPECULATION AMONG PARTIES DIRECTLY INTERESTED
'IN 1839 GREAT HORSESHOE CUT OFF FORMED
'UP TO THE PRESENT TIME A TERM OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS WE ASCERTAIN BY
REFERENCE TO THE DIARY HE HAS MADE FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY ROUND TRIPS
TO NEW ORLEANS WHICH GIVES A DISTANCE OF ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED AND
FOUR THOUSAND MILES OR AN AVERAGE OF EIGHTY SIX MILES A DAY
WHENEVER CAPTAIN SELLERS APPROACHED A BODY OF GOSSIPING PILOTS A CHILL
FELL THERE AND TALKING CEASED
FOR THIS REASON WHENEVER SIX PILOTS
WERE GATHERED TOGETHER THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE ONE OR TWO NEWLY FLEDGED
ONES IN THE LOT AND THE ELDER ONES WOULD BE ALWAYS 'SHOWING OFF' BEFORE
THESE POOR FELLOWS MAKING THEM SORROWFULLY FEEL HOW CALLOW THEY WERE
HOW RECENT THEIR NOBILITY AND HOW HUMBLE THEIR DEGREE BY TALKING
LARGELY AND VAPOROUSLY OF OLD TIME EXPERIENCES ON THE RIVER ALWAYS
MAKING IT A POINT TO DATE EVERYTHING BACK AS FAR AS THEY COULD SO AS TO
MAKE THE NEW MEN FEEL THEIR NEWNESS TO THE SHARPEST DEGREE POSSIBLE
AND ENVY THE OLD STAGERS IN THE LIKE DEGREE
AND HOW THESE COMPLACENT
BALDHEADS WOULD SWELL AND BRAG AND LIE AND DATE BACK TEN FIFTEEN
TWENTY YEARS AND HOW THEY DID ENJOY THE EFFECT PRODUCED UPON THE
MARVELING AND ENVYING YOUNGSTERS
AND PERHAPS JUST AT THIS HAPPY STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS THE STATELY
FIGURE OF CAPTAIN ISAIAH SELLERS THAT REAL AND ONLY GENUINE SON OF
ANTIQUITY WOULD DRIFT SOLEMNLY INTO THE MIDST
IMAGINE THE SIZE OF THE
SILENCE THAT WOULD RESULT ON THE INSTANT
AND IMAGINE THE FEELINGS OF
THOSE BALD HEADS AND THE EXULTATION OF THEIR RECENT AUDIENCE WHEN THE
ANCIENT CAPTAIN WOULD BEGIN TO DROP CASUAL AND INDIFFERENT REMARKS OF A
REMINISCENT NATURE ABOUT ISLANDS THAT HAD DISAPPEARED AND CUTOFFS THAT
HAD BEEN MADE A GENERATION BEFORE THE OLDEST BALD HEAD IN THE COMPANY
HAD EVER SET HIS FOOT IN A PILOT HOUSE
MANY AND MANY A TIME DID THIS ANCIENT MARINER APPEAR ON THE SCENE IN THE
ABOVE FASHION AND SPREAD DISASTER AND HUMILIATION AROUND HIM
IF ONE
MIGHT BELIEVE THE PILOTS HE ALWAYS DATED HIS ISLANDS BACK TO THE MISTY
DAWN OF RIVER HISTORY AND HE NEVER USED THE SAME ISLAND TWICE AND
NEVER DID HE EMPLOY AN ISLAND THAT STILL EXISTED OR GIVE ONE A NAME
WHICH ANYBODY PRESENT WAS OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE HEARD OF BEFORE
IF YOU
MIGHT BELIEVE THE PILOTS HE WAS ALWAYS CONSCIENTIOUSLY PARTICULAR
ABOUT LITTLE DETAILS NEVER SPOKE OF 'THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI FOR
INSTANCE NO HE WOULD SAY 'WHEN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WAS WHERE
ARKANSAS NOW IS AND WOULD NEVER SPEAK OF LOUISIANA OR MISSOURI IN
A GENERAL WAY AND LEAVE AN INCORRECT IMPRESSION ON YOUR MIND NO HE
WOULD SAY 'WHEN LOUISIANA WAS UP THE RIVER FARTHER OR 'WHEN MISSOURI
WAS ON THE ILLINOIS SIDE
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS NOT OF LITERARY TURN OR CAPACITY BUT HE USED
TO JOT DOWN BRIEF PARAGRAPHS OF PLAIN PRACTICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE
RIVER AND SIGN THEM MARK TWAIN AND GIVE THEM TO THE 'NEW ORLEANS
PICAYUNE THEY RELATED TO THE STAGE AND CONDITION OF THE RIVER AND
WERE ACCURATE AND VALUABLE AND THUS FAR THEY CONTAINED NO POISON
BUT IN SPEAKING OF THE STAGE OF THE RIVER TO DAY AT A GIVEN POINT THE
CAPTAIN WAS PRETTY APT TO DROP IN A LITTLE REMARK ABOUT THIS BEING THE
FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN THE WATER SO HIGH OR SO LOW AT THAT PARTICULAR
POINT FOR FORTY NINE YEARS AND NOW AND THEN HE WOULD MENTION ISLAND
SO AND SO AND FOLLOW IT IN PARENTHESES WITH SOME SUCH OBSERVATION
AS 'DISAPPEARED IN 1807 IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY IN THESE ANTIQUE
INTERJECTIONS LAY POISON AND BITTERNESS FOR THE OTHER OLD PILOTS AND
THEY USED TO CHAFF THE 'MARK TWAIN' PARAGRAPHS WITH UNSPARING MOCKERY
IT SO CHANCED THAT ONE OF THESE PARAGRAPHS FOOTNOTE THE ORIGINAL MS
OF IT IN THE CAPTAIN'S OWN HAND HAS BEEN SENT TO ME FROM NEW ORLEANS
IT READS AS FOLLOWS
VICKSBURG MAY 4 1859
'MY OPINION FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CITIZENS OF NEW ORLEANS THE WATER
IS HIGHER THIS FAR UP THAN IT HAS BEEN SINCE 8
MY OPINION IS THAT THE
WATER WILL BE FEET DEEP IN CANAL STREET BEFORE THE FIRST OF NEXT JUNE
MRS
TURNER'S PLANTATION AT THE HEAD OF BIG BLACK ISLAND IS ALL UNDER
WATER AND IT HAS NOT BEEN SINCE 1815
'I
SELLERS
BECAME THE TEXT FOR MY FIRST NEWSPAPER ARTICLE
I BURLESQUED IT BROADLY
VERY BROADLY STRINGING MY FANTASTICS OUT TO THE EXTENT OF EIGHT HUNDRED
OR A THOUSAND WORDS
I WAS A 'CUB' AT THE TIME
I SHOWED MY PERFORMANCE
TO SOME PILOTS AND THEY EAGERLY RUSHED IT INTO PRINT IN THE 'NEW
ORLEANS TRUE DELTA IT WAS A GREAT PITY FOR IT DID NOBODY ANY WORTHY
SERVICE AND IT SENT A PANG DEEP INTO A GOOD MAN'S HEART
THERE WAS NO
MALICE IN MY RUBBISH BUT IT LAUGHED AT THE CAPTAIN
IT LAUGHED AT A MAN
TO WHOM SUCH A THING WAS NEW AND STRANGE AND DREADFUL
I DID NOT KNOW
THEN THOUGH I DO NOW THAT THERE IS NO SUFFERING COMPARABLE WITH THAT
WHICH A PRIVATE PERSON FEELS WHEN HE IS FOR THE FIRST TIME PILLORIED IN
PRINT
CAPTAIN SELLERS DID ME THE HONOR TO PROFOUNDLY DETEST ME FROM THAT DAY
FORTH
WHEN I SAY HE DID ME THE HONOR I AM NOT USING EMPTY WORDS
IT
WAS A VERY REAL HONOR TO BE IN THE THOUGHTS OF SO GREAT A MAN AS CAPTAIN
SELLERS AND I HAD WIT ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE IT AND BE PROUD OF IT
IT
WAS DISTINCTION TO BE LOVED BY SUCH A MAN BUT IT WAS A MUCH GREATER
DISTINCTION TO BE HATED BY HIM BECAUSE HE LOVED SCORES OF PEOPLE BUT
HE DIDN'T SIT UP NIGHTS TO HATE ANYBODY BUT ME
HE NEVER PRINTED ANOTHER PARAGRAPH WHILE HE LIVED AND HE NEVER AGAIN
SIGNED 'MARK TWAIN' TO ANYTHING
AT THE TIME THAT THE TELEGRAPH BROUGHT
THE NEWS OF HIS DEATH I WAS ON THE PACIFIC COAST
I WAS A FRESH NEW
JOURNALIST AND NEEDED A NOM DE GUERRE SO I CONFISCATED THE ANCIENT
MARINER'S DISCARDED ONE AND HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE IT REMAIN WHAT IT
WAS IN HIS HANDS A SIGN AND SYMBOL AND WARRANT THAT WHATEVER IS FOUND
IN ITS COMPANY MAY BE GAMBLED ON AS BEING THE PETRIFIED TRUTH HOW I
HAVE SUCCEEDED IT WOULD NOT BE MODEST IN ME TO SAY
THE CAPTAIN HAD AN HONORABLE PRIDE IN HIS PROFESSION AND AN ABIDING LOVE
FOR IT
HE ORDERED HIS MONUMENT BEFORE HE DIED AND KEPT IT NEAR
HIM UNTIL HE DID DIE
IT STANDS OVER HIS GRAVE NOW IN BELLEFONTAINE
CEMETERY ST
LOUIS
IT IS HIS IMAGE IN MARBLE STANDING ON DUTY AT
THE PILOT WHEEL AND WORTHY TO STAND AND CONFRONT CRITICISM FOR IT
REPRESENTS A MAN WHO IN LIFE WOULD HAVE STAYED THERE TILL HE BURNED TO A
CINDER IF DUTY REQUIRED IT
THE FINEST THING WE SAW ON OUR WHOLE MISSISSIPPI TRIP WE SAW AS WE
APPROACHED NEW ORLEANS IN THE STEAM TUG
THIS WAS THE CURVING FRONTAGE
OF THE CRESCENT CITY LIT UP WITH THE WHITE GLARE OF FIVE MILES OF
ELECTRIC LIGHTS
IT WAS A WONDERFUL SIGHT AND VERY BEAUTIFUL
CHAPTER 51
REMINISCENCES
WE LEFT FOR ST
LOUIS IN THE 'CITY OF BATON ROUGE ON A DELIGHTFULLY
HOT DAY BUT WITH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF MY VISIT BUT LAMELY ACCOMPLISHED
I HAD HOPED TO HUNT UP AND TALK WITH A HUNDRED STEAMBOATMEN BUT GOT SO
PLEASANTLY INVOLVED IN THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE TOWN THAT I GOT NOTHING
MORE THAN MERE FIVE MINUTE TALKS WITH A COUPLE OF DOZEN OF THE CRAFT
I WAS ON THE BENCH OF THE PILOT HOUSE WHEN WE BACKED OUT AND
'STRAIGHTENED UP' FOR THE START THE BOAT PAUSING FOR A 'GOOD READY
IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY AND THE BLACK SMOKE PILING OUT OF THE CHIMNEYS
EQUALLY IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY
THEN WE BEGAN TO GATHER MOMENTUM AND
PRESENTLY WERE FAIRLY UNDER WAY AND BOOMING ALONG
IT WAS ALL AS NATURAL
AND FAMILIAR AND SO WERE THE SHOREWARD SIGHTS AS IF THERE HAD BEEN NO
BREAK IN MY RIVER LIFE
THERE WAS A 'CUB AND I JUDGED THAT HE
WOULD TAKE THE WHEEL NOW AND HE DID
CAPTAIN BIXBY STEPPED INTO THE
PILOT HOUSE
PRESENTLY THE CUB CLOSED UP ON THE RANK OF STEAMSHIPS
HE
MADE ME NERVOUS FOR HE ALLOWED TOO MUCH WATER TO SHOW BETWEEN OUR BOAT
AND THE SHIPS
I KNEW QUITE WELL WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE
I COULD DATE BACK IN MY OWN LIFE AND INSPECT THE RECORD
THE CAPTAIN
LOOKED ON DURING A SILENT HALF MINUTE THEN TOOK THE WHEEL HIMSELF AND
CROWDED THE BOAT IN TILL SHE WENT SCRAPING ALONG WITHIN A HAND BREADTH
OF THE SHIPS
IT WAS EXACTLY THE FAVOR WHICH HE HAD DONE ME ABOUT A
QUARTER OF A CENTURY BEFORE IN THAT SAME SPOT THE FIRST TIME I EVER
STEAMED OUT OF THE PORT OF NEW ORLEANS
IT WAS A VERY GREAT AND SINCERE
PLEASURE TO ME TO SEE THE THING REPEATED WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AS VICTIM
WE MADE NATCHEZ THREE HUNDRED MILES IN TWENTY TWO HOURS AND A HALF
MUCH THE SWIFTEST PASSAGE I HAVE EVER MADE OVER THAT PIECE OF WATER
THE NEXT MORNING I CAME ON WITH THE FOUR O'CLOCK WATCH AND SAW RITCHIE
SUCCESSFULLY RUN HALF A DOZEN CROSSINGS IN A FOG USING FOR HIS GUIDANCE
THE MARKED CHART DEVISED AND PATENTED BY BIXBY AND HIMSELF
THIS
SUFFICIENTLY EVIDENCED THE GREAT VALUE OF THE CHART
BY AND BY WHEN THE FOG BEGAN TO CLEAR OFF I NOTICED THAT THE
REFLECTION OF A TREE IN THE SMOOTH WATER OF AN OVERFLOWED BANK SIX
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WAS STRONGER AND BLACKER THAN THE GHOSTLY TREE
ITSELF
THE FAINT SPECTRAL TREES DIMLY GLIMPSED THROUGH THE SHREDDING
FOG WERE VERY PRETTY THINGS TO SEE
WE HAD A HEAVY THUNDER STORM AT NATCHEZ ANOTHER AT VICKSBURG AND
STILL ANOTHER ABOUT FIFTY MILES BELOW MEMPHIS
THEY HAD AN OLD FASHIONED
ENERGY WHICH HAD LONG BEEN UNFAMILIAR TO ME
THIS THIRD STORM WAS
ACCOMPANIED BY A RAGING WIND
WE TIED UP TO THE BANK WHEN WE SAW THE
TEMPEST COMING AND EVERYBODY LEFT THE PILOT HOUSE BUT ME
THE WIND BENT
THE YOUNG TREES DOWN EXPOSING THE PALE UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAVES AND
GUST AFTER GUST FOLLOWED IN QUICK SUCCESSION THRASHING THE BRANCHES
VIOLENTLY UP AND DOWN AND TO THIS SIDE AND THAT AND CREATING SWIFT
WAVES OF ALTERNATING GREEN AND WHITE ACCORDING TO THE SIDE OF THE LEAF
THAT WAS EXPOSED AND THESE WAVES RACED AFTER EACH OTHER AS DO THEIR
KIND OVER A WIND TOSSED FIELD OF OATS
NO COLOR THAT WAS VISIBLE
ANYWHERE WAS QUITE NATURAL ALL TINTS WERE CHARGED WITH A LEADEN TINGE
FROM THE SOLID CLOUD BANK OVERHEAD
THE RIVER WAS LEADEN ALL DISTANCES
THE SAME AND EVEN THE FAR REACHING RANKS OF COMBING WHITE CAPS WERE
DULLY SHADED BY THE DARK RICH ATMOSPHERE THROUGH WHICH THEIR SWARMING
LEGIONS MARCHED
THE THUNDER PEALS WERE CONSTANT AND DEAFENING
EXPLOSION FOLLOWED EXPLOSION WITH BUT INCONSEQUENTIAL INTERVALS BETWEEN
AND THE REPORTS GREW STEADILY SHARPER AND HIGHER KEYED AND MORE TRYING
TO THE EAR THE LIGHTNING WAS AS DILIGENT AS THE THUNDER AND PRODUCED
EFFECTS WHICH ENCHANTED THE EYE AND SENT ELECTRIC ECSTASIES OF MIXED
DELIGHT AND APPREHENSION SHIVERING ALONG EVERY NERVE IN THE BODY IN
UNINTERMITTENT PROCESSION
THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN AMAZING VOLUME THE
EAR SPLITTING THUNDER PEALS BROKE NEARER AND NEARER THE WIND INCREASED
IN FURY AND BEGAN TO WRENCH OFF BOUGHS AND TREE TOPS AND SEND THEM
SAILING AWAY THROUGH SPACE THE PILOT HOUSE FELL TO ROCKING AND
STRAINING AND CRACKING AND SURGING AND I WENT DOWN IN THE HOLD TO SEE
WHAT TIME IT WAS
PEOPLE BOAST A GOOD DEAL ABOUT ALPINE THUNDERSTORMS BUT THE STORMS
WHICH I HAVE HAD THE LUCK TO SEE IN THE ALPS WERE NOT THE EQUALS OF SOME
WHICH I HAVE SEEN IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
I MAY NOT HAVE SEEN THE
ALPS DO THEIR BEST OF COURSE AND IF THEY CAN BEAT THE MISSISSIPPI I
DON'T WISH TO
ON THIS UP TRIP I SAW A LITTLE TOWHEAD INFANT ISLAND HALF A MILE LONG
WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED DURING THE PAST NINETEEN YEARS
SINCE THERE WAS
SO MUCH TIME TO SPARE THAT NINETEEN YEARS OF IT COULD BE DEVOTED TO
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MERE TOWHEAD WHERE WAS THE USE ORIGINALLY IN
RUSHING THIS WHOLE GLOBE THROUGH IN SIX DAYS IT IS LIKELY THAT IF MORE
TIME HAD BEEN TAKEN IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WORLD WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE
RIGHT AND THIS CEASELESS IMPROVING AND REPAIRING WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY
NOW
BUT IF YOU HURRY A WORLD OR A HOUSE YOU ARE NEARLY SURE TO FIND
OUT BY AND BY THAT YOU HAVE LEFT OUT A TOWHEAD OR A BROOM CLOSET
OR SOME OTHER LITTLE CONVENIENCE HERE AND THERE WHICH HAS GOT TO BE
SUPPLIED NO MATTER HOW MUCH EXPENSE AND VEXATION IT MAY COST
WE HAD A SUCCESSION OF BLACK NIGHTS GOING UP THE RIVER AND IT WAS
OBSERVABLE THAT WHENEVER WE LANDED AND SUDDENLY INUNDATED THE TREES
WITH THE INTENSE SUNBURST OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT A CERTAIN CURIOUS
EFFECT WAS ALWAYS PRODUCED HUNDREDS OF BIRDS FLOCKED INSTANTLY OUT
FROM THE MASSES OF SHINING GREEN FOLIAGE AND WENT CAREERING HITHER AND
THITHER THROUGH THE WHITE RAYS AND OFTEN A SONG BIRD TUNED UP AND FELL
TO SINGING
WE JUDGED THAT THEY MISTOOK THIS SUPERB ARTIFICIAL DAY
FOR THE GENUINE ARTICLE
WE HAD A DELIGHTFUL TRIP IN THAT THOROUGHLY
WELL ORDERED STEAMER AND REGRETTED THAT IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED SO
SPEEDILY
BY MEANS OF DILIGENCE AND ACTIVITY WE MANAGED TO HUNT OUT
NEARLY ALL THE OLD FRIENDS
ONE WAS MISSING HOWEVER HE WENT TO HIS
REWARD WHATEVER IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO
BUT I FOUND OUT ALL ABOUT HIM
HIS CASE HELPED ME TO REALIZE HOW LASTING CAN BE THE EFFECT OF A
VERY TRIFLING OCCURRENCE
WHEN HE WAS AN APPRENTICE BLACKSMITH IN OUR
VILLAGE AND I A SCHOOLBOY A COUPLE OF YOUNG ENGLISHMEN CAME TO THE
TOWN AND SOJOURNED A WHILE AND ONE DAY THEY GOT THEMSELVES UP IN CHEAP
ROYAL FINERY AND DID THE RICHARD III SWORDFIGHT WITH MANIAC ENERGY AND
PRODIGIOUS POWWOW IN THE PRESENCE OF THE VILLAGE BOYS
THIS BLACKSMITH
CUB WAS THERE AND THE HISTRIONIC POISON ENTERED HIS BONES
THIS
VAST LUMBERING IGNORANT DULL WITTED LOUT WAS STAGE STRUCK AND
IRRECOVERABLY
HE DISAPPEARED AND PRESENTLY TURNED UP IN ST
LOUIS
I RAN ACROSS HIM THERE BY AND BY
HE WAS STANDING MUSING ON A STREET
CORNER WITH HIS LEFT HAND ON HIS HIP THE THUMB OF HIS RIGHT SUPPORTING
HIS CHIN FACE BOWED AND FROWNING SLOUCH HAT PULLED DOWN OVER HIS
FOREHEAD IMAGINING HIMSELF TO BE OTHELLO OR SOME SUCH CHARACTER AND
IMAGINING THAT THE PASSING CROWD MARKED HIS TRAGIC BEARING AND WERE
AWESTRUCK
I JOINED HIM AND TRIED TO GET HIM DOWN OUT OF THE CLOUDS BUT DID NOT
SUCCEED
HOWEVER HE CASUALLY INFORMED ME PRESENTLY THAT HE WAS A
MEMBER OF THE WALNUT STREET THEATER COMPANY AND HE TRIED TO SAY IT WITH
INDIFFERENCE BUT THE INDIFFERENCE WAS THIN AND A MIGHTY EXULTATION
SHOWED THROUGH IT
HE SAID HE WAS CAST FOR A PART IN JULIUS CAESAR FOR
THAT NIGHT AND IF I SHOULD COME I WOULD SEE HIM
IF I SHOULD COME I
SAID I WOULDN'T MISS IT IF I WERE DEAD
I WENT AWAY STUPEFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AND SAYING TO MYSELF 'HOW
STRANGE IT IS WE ALWAYS THOUGHT THIS FELLOW A FOOL YET THE MOMENT HE
COMES TO A GREAT CITY WHERE INTELLIGENCE AND APPRECIATION ABOUND
THE TALENT CONCEALED IN THIS SHABBY NAPKIN IS AT ONCE DISCOVERED AND
PROMPTLY WELCOMED AND HONORED
BUT I CAME AWAY FROM THE THEATER THAT NIGHT DISAPPOINTED AND OFFENDED
FOR I HAD HAD NO GLIMPSE OF MY HERO AND HIS NAME WAS NOT IN THE BILLS
I MET HIM ON THE STREET THE NEXT MORNING AND BEFORE I COULD SPEAK HE
ASKED
'DID YOU SEE ME
'NO YOU WEREN'T THERE
HE LOOKED SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED
HE SAID
'YES I WAS
INDEED I WAS
I WAS A ROMAN SOLDIER
'WHICH ONE
'WHY DIDN'T YOU SEE THEM ROMAN SOLDIERS THAT STOOD BACK THERE IN A RANK
AND SOMETIMES MARCHED IN PROCESSION AROUND THE STAGE
'DO YOU MEAN THE ROMAN ARMY THOSE SIX SANDALED ROUSTABOUTS IN
NIGHTSHIRTS WITH TIN SHIELDS AND HELMETS THAT MARCHED AROUND TREADING
ON EACH OTHER'S HEELS IN CHARGE OF A SPIDER LEGGED CONSUMPTIVE DRESSED
LIKE THEMSELVES
'THAT'S IT THAT'S IT I WAS ONE OF THEM ROMAN SOLDIERS
I WAS THE NEXT
TO THE LAST ONE
A HALF A YEAR AGO I USED TO ALWAYS BE THE LAST ONE BUT
I'VE BEEN PROMOTED
WELL THEY TOLD ME THAT THAT POOR FELLOW REMAINED A ROMAN SOLDIER TO
THE LAST A MATTER OF THIRTY FOUR YEARS
SOMETIMES THEY CAST HIM FOR A
'SPEAKING PART BUT NOT AN ELABORATE ONE
HE COULD BE TRUSTED TO GO
AND SAY 'MY LORD THE CARRIAGE WAITS BUT IF THEY VENTURED TO ADD A
SENTENCE OR TWO TO THIS HIS MEMORY FELT THE STRAIN AND HE WAS LIKELY TO
MISS FIRE
YET POOR DEVIL HE HAD BEEN PATIENTLY STUDYING THE PART OF
HAMLET FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AND HE LIVED AND DIED IN THE BELIEF
THAT SOME DAY HE WOULD BE INVITED TO PLAY IT
AND THIS IS WHAT CAME OF THAT FLEETING VISIT OF THOSE YOUNG ENGLISHMEN
TO OUR VILLAGE SUCH AGES AND AGES AGO WHAT NOBLE HORSESHOES THIS MAN
MIGHT HAVE MADE BUT FOR THOSE ENGLISHMEN AND WHAT AN INADEQUATE ROMAN
SOLDIER HE DID MAKE
A DAY OR TWO AFTER WE REACHED ST
LOUIS I WAS WALKING ALONG FOURTH
STREET WHEN A GRIZZLY HEADED MAN GAVE A SORT OF START AS HE PASSED ME
THEN STOPPED CAME BACK INSPECTED ME NARROWLY WITH A CLOUDING BROW
AND FINALLY SAID WITH DEEP ASPERITY
'LOOK HERE HAVE YOU GOT THAT DRINK YET
A MANIAC I JUDGED AT FIRST
BUT ALL IN A FLASH I RECOGNIZED HIM
I
MADE AN EFFORT TO BLUSH THAT STRAINED EVERY MUSCLE IN ME AND ANSWERED
AS SWEETLY AND WINNINGLY AS EVER I KNEW HOW
'BEEN A LITTLE SLOW BUT AM JUST THIS MINUTE CLOSING IN ON THE PLACE
WHERE THEY KEEP IT
COME IN AND HELP
HE SOFTENED AND SAID MAKE IT A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AND HE WAS
AGREEABLE
HE SAID HE HAD SEEN MY NAME IN THE PAPERS AND HAD PUT ALL
HIS AFFAIRS ASIDE AND TURNED OUT RESOLVED TO FIND ME OR DIE AND MAKE
ME ANSWER THAT QUESTION SATISFACTORILY OR KILL ME THOUGH THE MOST OF
HIS LATE ASPERITY HAD BEEN RATHER COUNTERFEIT THAN OTHERWISE
THIS MEETING BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE ST
LOUIS RIOTS OF ABOUT THIRTY
YEARS AGO
I SPENT A WEEK THERE AT THAT TIME IN A BOARDING HOUSE AND
HAD THIS YOUNG FELLOW FOR A NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE HALL
WE SAW SOME OF
THE FIGHTINGS AND KILLINGS AND BY AND BY WE WENT ONE NIGHT TO AN ARMORY
WHERE TWO HUNDRED YOUNG MEN HAD MET UPON CALL TO BE ARMED AND GO FORTH
AGAINST THE RIOTERS UNDER COMMAND OF A MILITARY MAN
WE DRILLED TILL
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT THEN NEWS CAME THAT THE MOB WERE IN GREAT
FORCE IN THE LOWER END OF THE TOWN AND WERE SWEEPING EVERYTHING BEFORE
THEM
OUR COLUMN MOVED AT ONCE
IT WAS A VERY HOT NIGHT AND MY MUSKET
WAS VERY HEAVY
WE MARCHED AND MARCHED AND THE NEARER WE APPROACHED THE
SEAT OF WAR THE HOTTER I GREW AND THE THIRSTIER I GOT
I WAS BEHIND MY
FRIEND SO FINALLY I ASKED HIM TO HOLD MY MUSKET WHILE I DROPPED OUT
AND GOT A DRINK
THEN I BRANCHED OFF AND WENT HOME
I WAS NOT FEELING
ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIM OF COURSE BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS SO WELL ARMED
NOW THAT HE COULD TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
IF I HAD
HAD ANY DOUBTS ABOUT THAT I WOULD HAVE BORROWED ANOTHER MUSKET FOR HIM
I LEFT THE CITY PRETTY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND IF THIS GRIZZLED MAN
HAD NOT HAPPENED TO ENCOUNTER MY NAME IN THE PAPERS THE OTHER DAY IN ST
LOUIS AND FELT MOVED TO SEEK ME OUT I SHOULD HAVE CARRIED TO MY GRAVE
A HEART TORTURING UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER HE EVER GOT OUT OF THE RIOTS
ALL RIGHT OR NOT
I OUGHT TO HAVE INQUIRED THIRTY YEARS AGO I KNOW
THAT
AND I WOULD HAVE INQUIRED IF I HAD HAD THE MUSKETS BUT IN THE
CIRCUMSTANCES HE SEEMED BETTER FIXED TO CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATIONS THAN
I WAS
ONE MONDAY NEAR THE TIME OF OUR VISIT TO ST
LOUIS THE
'GLOBE DEMOCRAT' CAME OUT WITH A COUPLE OF PAGES OF SUNDAY STATISTICS
WHEREBY IT APPEARED THAT 119 448 ST
LOUIS PEOPLE ATTENDED THE MORNING
AND EVENING CHURCH SERVICES THE DAY BEFORE AND 23 102 CHILDREN ATTENDED
SUNDAY SCHOOL
THUS 142 550 PERSONS OUT OF THE CITY'S TOTAL OF 400 000
POPULATION RESPECTED THE DAY RELIGIOUS WISE
I FOUND THESE STATISTICS
IN A CONDENSED FORM IN A TELEGRAM OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS AND
PRESERVED THEM
THEY MADE IT APPARENT THAT ST
LOUIS WAS IN A HIGHER
STATE OF GRACE THAN SHE COULD HAVE CLAIMED TO BE IN MY TIME
BUT NOW
THAT I CANVASS THE FIGURES NARROWLY I SUSPECT THAT THE TELEGRAPH
MUTILATED THEM
IT CANNOT BE THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN 150 000 CATHOLICS
IN THE TOWN THE OTHER 250 000 MUST BE CLASSIFIED AS PROTESTANTS
OUT
OF THESE 250 000 ACCORDING TO THIS QUESTIONABLE TELEGRAM ONLY 26 362
ATTENDED CHURCH AND SUNDAY SCHOOL WHILE OUT OF THE 150 000 CATHOLICS
116 188 WENT TO CHURCH AND SUNDAY SCHOOL
CHAPTER 52
A BURNING BRAND
ALL AT ONCE THE THOUGHT CAME INTO MY MIND 'I HAVE NOT SOUGHT OUT MR
BROWN
UPON THAT TEXT I DESIRE TO DEPART FROM THE DIRECT LINE OF MY SUBJECT
AND MAKE A LITTLE EXCURSION
I WISH TO REVEAL A SECRET WHICH I HAVE
CARRIED WITH ME NINE YEARS AND WHICH HAS BECOME BURDENSOME
UPON A CERTAIN OCCASION NINE YEARS AGO I HAD SAID WITH STRONG
FEELING 'IF EVER I SEE ST
LOUIS AGAIN I WILL SEEK OUT MR
BROWN THE
GREAT GRAIN MERCHANT AND ASK OF HIM THE PRIVILEGE OF SHAKING HIM BY THE
HAND
THE OCCASION AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AS FOLLOWS
A FRIEND OF MINE A
CLERGYMAN CAME ONE EVENING AND SAID
'I HAVE A MOST REMARKABLE LETTER HERE WHICH I WANT TO READ TO YOU IF
I CAN DO IT WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN
I MUST PREFACE IT WITH SOME
EXPLANATIONS HOWEVER
THE LETTER IS WRITTEN BY AN EX THIEF AND
EX VAGABOND OF THE LOWEST ORIGIN AND BASEST REARING A MAN ALL STAINED
WITH CRIME AND STEEPED IN IGNORANCE BUT THANK GOD WITH A MINE OF PURE
GOLD HIDDEN AWAY IN HIM AS YOU SHALL SEE
HIS LETTER IS WRITTEN TO A
BURGLAR NAMED WILLIAMS WHO IS SERVING A NINE YEAR TERM IN A CERTAIN
STATE PRISON FOR BURGLARY
WILLIAMS WAS A PARTICULARLY DARING BURGLAR
AND PLIED THAT TRADE DURING A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT HE WAS CAUGHT AT LAST
AND JAILED TO AWAIT TRIAL IN A TOWN WHERE HE HAD BROKEN INTO A HOUSE AT
NIGHT PISTOL IN HAND AND FORCED THE OWNER TO HAND OVER TO HIM 8 000
IN GOVERNMENT BONDS
WILLIAMS WAS NOT A COMMON SORT OF PERSON BY
ANY MEANS HE WAS A GRADUATE OF HARVARD COLLEGE AND CAME OF GOOD NEW
ENGLAND STOCK
HIS FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN
WHILE LYING IN JAIL HIS
HEALTH BEGAN TO FAIL AND HE WAS THREATENED WITH CONSUMPTION
THIS
FACT TOGETHER WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REFLECTION AFFORDED BY SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT HAD ITS EFFECT ITS NATURAL EFFECT
HE FELL INTO SERIOUS
THOUGHT HIS EARLY TRAINING ASSERTED ITSELF WITH POWER AND WROUGHT WITH
STRONG INFLUENCE UPON HIS MIND AND HEART
HE PUT HIS OLD LIFE BEHIND
HIM AND BECAME AN EARNEST CHRISTIAN
SOME LADIES IN THE TOWN HEARD OF
THIS VISITED HIM AND BY THEIR ENCOURAGING WORDS SUPPORTED HIM IN HIS
GOOD RESOLUTIONS AND STRENGTHENED HIM TO CONTINUE IN HIS NEW LIFE
THE
TRIAL ENDED IN HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCE TO THE STATE PRISON FOR
THE TERM OF NINE YEARS AS I HAVE BEFORE SAID
IN THE PRISON HE BECAME
ACQUAINTED WITH THE POOR WRETCH REFERRED TO IN THE BEGINNING OF MY TALK
JACK HUNT THE WRITER OF THE LETTER WHICH I AM GOING TO READ
YOU WILL
SEE THAT THE ACQUAINTANCESHIP BORE FRUIT FOR HUNT
WHEN HUNT'S TIME WAS
OUT HE WANDERED TO ST
LOUIS AND FROM THAT PLACE HE WROTE HIS LETTER
TO WILLIAMS
THE LETTER GOT NO FURTHER THAN THE OFFICE OF THE PRISON
WARDEN OF COURSE PRISONERS ARE NOT OFTEN ALLOWED TO RECEIVE LETTERS
FROM OUTSIDE
THE PRISON AUTHORITIES READ THIS LETTER BUT DID NOT
DESTROY IT
THEY HAD NOT THE HEART TO DO IT
THEY READ IT TO SEVERAL
PERSONS AND EVENTUALLY IT FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE LADIES OF WHOM I
SPOKE A WHILE AGO
THE OTHER DAY I CAME ACROSS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE A
CLERGYMAN WHO HAD SEEN THIS LETTER AND WAS FULL OF IT
THE MERE
REMEMBRANCE OF IT SO MOVED HIM THAT HE COULD NOT TALK OF IT WITHOUT
HIS VOICE BREAKING
HE PROMISED TO GET A COPY OF IT FOR ME AND HERE IT
IS AN EXACT COPY WITH ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE ORIGINAL PRESERVED
IT HAS MANY SLANG EXPRESSIONS IN IT THIEVES' ARGOT BUT THEIR MEANING
HAS BEEN INTERLINED IN PARENTHESES BY THE PRISON AUTHORITIES'
ST
LOUIS JUNE 9TH 1872
MR
W FRIEND CHARLIE IF I MAY CALL YOU SO I NO YOU ARE SURPRISED TO
GET A LETTER FROM ME BUT I HOPE YOU WON'T BE MAD AT MY WRITING TO YOU

WHEN
WE GOT TO CHICAGO ON THE CARS FROM THERE TO HERE I PULLED OFF AN OLD
WOMAN'S LEATHER
ROBBED HER OF HER POCKETBOOK I HADN'T NO MORE THAN GOT IT OFF WHEN I
WISHED I HADN'T DONE IT FOR AWHILE BEFORE THAT I MADE UP MY MIND TO BE
A SQUARE BLOKE FOR MONTHS ON YOUR WORD BUT FORGOT IT WHEN I SAW THE

SHE TUMBLED DISCOVERED HER LEATHER WAS OFF GONE IS THIS
IT SAYS I GIVING IT TO HER WELL IF YOU AINT HONEST SAYS SHE BUT I

TRYED IT I GOT STUCK ON THE START ALL I COULD GET OFF WOS LORD GIVE
A POOR FELLOW A CHANCE TO SQUARE IT FOR 3 MONTHS FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
AMEN I KEPT A THINKING OF IT OVER AND OVER AS I WENT ALONG ABOUT AN
HOUR AFTER THAT I WAS IN 4TH ST

OF MY BEING WHERE I AM NOW ABOUT WHICH I WILL TELL YOU BEFORE I GET
DONE WRITING
AS I WAS WALKING ALONG HERD A BIG NOISE SAW A HORSE

C W
WHO YOU KNOW AS JACK HUNT
I SEND YOU MR
BROWN'S CARD
SEND MY LETTER TO HIM
HERE WAS TRUE ELOQUENCE IRRESISTIBLE ELOQUENCE AND WITHOUT A SINGLE
GRACE OR ORNAMENT TO HELP IT OUT
I HAVE SELDOM BEEN SO DEEPLY STIRRED
BY ANY PIECE OF WRITING
THE READER OF IT HALTED ALL THE WAY THROUGH
ON A LAME AND BROKEN VOICE YET HE HAD TRIED TO FORTIFY HIS FEELINGS
BY SEVERAL PRIVATE READINGS OF THE LETTER BEFORE VENTURING INTO COMPANY
WITH IT
HE WAS PRACTISING UPON ME TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY HOPE OF HIS
BEING ABLE TO READ THE DOCUMENT TO HIS PRAYER MEETING WITH ANYTHING
LIKE A DECENT COMMAND OVER HIS FEELINGS
THE RESULT WAS NOT PROMISING
HOWEVER HE DETERMINED TO RISK IT AND DID
HE GOT THROUGH TOLERABLY
WELL BUT HIS AUDIENCE BROKE DOWN EARLY AND STAYED IN THAT CONDITION TO
THE END
THE FAME OF THE LETTER SPREAD THROUGH THE TOWN
A BROTHER MINISTER CAME
AND BORROWED THE MANUSCRIPT PUT IT BODILY INTO A SERMON PREACHED THE
SERMON TO TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE ON A SUNDAY MORNING AND THE LETTER
DROWNED THEM IN THEIR OWN TEARS
THEN MY FRIEND PUT IT INTO A SERMON AND
WENT BEFORE HIS SUNDAY MORNING CONGREGATION WITH IT
IT SCORED ANOTHER
TRIUMPH
THE HOUSE WEPT AS ONE INDIVIDUAL
MY FRIEND WENT ON SUMMER VACATION UP INTO THE FISHING REGIONS OF OUR
NORTHERN BRITISH NEIGHBORS AND CARRIED THIS SERMON WITH HIM SINCE HE
MIGHT POSSIBLY CHANCE TO NEED A SERMON
HE WAS ASKED TO PREACH ONE DAY
THE LITTLE CHURCH WAS FULL
AMONG THE PEOPLE PRESENT WERE THE LATE DR
J
G
HOLLAND THE LATE MR
SEYMOUR OF THE 'NEW YORK TIMES MR
PAGE
THE PHILANTHROPIST AND TEMPERANCE ADVOCATE AND I THINK SENATOR FRYE
OF MAINE
THE MARVELOUS LETTER DID ITS WONTED WORK ALL THE PEOPLE WERE
MOVED ALL THE PEOPLE WEPT THE TEARS FLOWED IN A STEADY STREAM DOWN DR
HOLLAND'S CHEEKS AND NEARLY THE SAME CAN BE SAID WITH REGARD TO ALL WHO
WERE THERE
MR
PAGE WAS SO FULL OF ENTHUSIASM OVER THE LETTER THAT HE
SAID HE WOULD NOT REST UNTIL HE MADE PILGRIMAGE TO THAT PRISON AND HAD
SPEECH WITH THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN ABLE TO INSPIRE A FELLOW UNFORTUNATE TO
WRITE SO PRICELESS A TRACT
AH THAT UNLUCKY PAGE AND ANOTHER MAN
IF THEY HAD ONLY BEEN IN
JERICHO THAT LETTER WOULD HAVE RUNG THROUGH THE WORLD AND STIRRED ALL
THE HEARTS OF ALL THE NATIONS FOR A THOUSAND YEARS TO COME AND NOBODY
MIGHT EVER HAVE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS THE CONFOUNDEDEST BRAZENEST
INGENIOUSEST PIECE OF FRAUD AND HUMBUGGERY THAT WAS EVER CONCOCTED TO
FOOL POOR CONFIDING MORTALS WITH
THE LETTER WAS A PURE SWINDLE AND THAT IS THE TRUTH
AND TAKE IT BY AND
LARGE IT WAS WITHOUT A COMPEER AMONG SWINDLES
IT WAS PERFECT IT WAS
ROUNDED SYMMETRICAL COMPLETE COLOSSAL
THE READER LEARNS IT AT THIS POINT BUT WE DIDN'T LEARN IT TILL SOME
MILES AND WEEKS BEYOND THIS STAGE OF THE AFFAIR
MY FRIEND CAME BACK
FROM THE WOODS AND HE AND OTHER CLERGYMEN AND LAY MISSIONARIES BEGAN
ONCE MORE TO INUNDATE AUDIENCES WITH THEIR TEARS AND THE TEARS OF
SAID AUDIENCES I BEGGED HARD FOR PERMISSION TO PRINT THE LETTER IN A
MAGAZINE AND TELL THE WATERY STORY OF ITS TRIUMPHS NUMBERS OF PEOPLE
GOT COPIES OF THE LETTER WITH PERMISSION TO CIRCULATE THEM IN WRITING
BUT NOT IN PRINT COPIES WERE SENT TO THE SANDWICH ISLANDS AND OTHER FAR
REGIONS
CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER WAS AT CHURCH ONE DAY WHEN THE WORN LETTER
WAS READ AND WEPT OVER
AT THE CHURCH DOOR AFTERWARD HE DROPPED A
PECULIARLY COLD ICEBERG DOWN THE CLERGYMAN'S BACK WITH THE QUESTION
'DO YOU KNOW THAT LETTER TO BE GENUINE
IT WAS THE FIRST SUSPICION THAT HAD EVER BEEN VOICED BUT IT HAD THAT
SICKENING EFFECT WHICH FIRST UTTERED SUSPICIONS AGAINST ONE'S IDOL
ALWAYS HAVE
SOME TALK FOLLOWED
'WHY WHAT SHOULD MAKE YOU SUSPECT THAT IT ISN'T GENUINE
'NOTHING THAT I KNOW OF EXCEPT THAT IT IS TOO NEAT AND COMPACT AND
FLUENT AND NICELY PUT TOGETHER FOR AN IGNORANT PERSON AN UNPRACTISED
HAND
I THINK IT WAS DONE BY AN EDUCATED MAN
THE LITERARY ARTIST HAD DETECTED THE LITERARY MACHINERY
IF YOU WILL
LOOK AT THE LETTER NOW YOU WILL DETECT IT YOURSELF IT IS OBSERVABLE IN
EVERY LINE
STRAIGHTWAY THE CLERGYMAN WENT OFF WITH THIS SEED OF SUSPICION
SPROUTING IN HIM AND WROTE TO A MINISTER RESIDING IN THAT TOWN WHERE
WILLIAMS HAD BEEN JAILED AND CONVERTED ASKED FOR LIGHT AND ALSO ASKED
IF A PERSON IN THE LITERARY LINE MEANING ME MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO PRINT
THE LETTER AND TELL ITS HISTORY
HE PRESENTLY RECEIVED THIS ANSWER
REV
MY DEAR FRIEND IN REGARD TO THAT 'CONVICT'S LETTER' THERE CAN BE NO
DOUBT AS TO ITS GENUINENESS
'WILLIAMS TO WHOM IT WAS WRITTEN LAY IN
OUR JAIL AND PROFESSED TO HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AND REV
MR THE
CHAPLAIN HAD GREAT FAITH IN THE GENUINENESS OF THE CHANGE AS MUCH AS
ONE CAN HAVE IN ANY SUCH CASE
THE LETTER WAS SENT TO ONE OF OUR LADIES WHO IS A SUNDAY SCHOOL
TEACHER SENT EITHER BY WILLIAMS HIMSELF OR THE CHAPLAIN OF THE
STATE'S PRISON PROBABLY
SHE HAS BEEN GREATLY ANNOYED IN HAVING SO MUCH
PUBLICITY LEST IT MIGHT SEEM A BREACH OF CONFIDENCE OR BE AN INJURY TO
WILLIAMS
IN REGARD TO ITS PUBLICATION I CAN GIVE NO PERMISSION THOUGH
IF THE NAMES AND PLACES WERE OMITTED AND ESPECIALLY IF SENT OUT OF THE
COUNTRY I THINK YOU MIGHT TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND DO IT
IT IS A WONDERFUL LETTER WHICH NO CHRISTIAN GENIUS MUCH LESS ONE
UNSANCTIFIED COULD EVER HAVE WRITTEN
AS SHOWING THE WORK OF GRACE IN
A HUMAN HEART AND IN A VERY DEGRADED AND WICKED ONE IT PROVES ITS OWN
ORIGIN AND REPROVES OUR WEAK FAITH IN ITS POWER TO COPE WITH ANY FORM OF
WICKEDNESS
'MR
BROWN' OF ST
LOUIS SOME ONE SAID WAS A HARTFORD MAN
DO ALL WHOM
YOU SEND FROM HARTFORD SERVE THEIR MASTER AS WELL
P S WILLIAMS IS STILL IN THE STATE'S PRISON SERVING OUT A LONG
SENTENCE OF NINE YEARS I THINK
HE HAS BEEN SICK AND THREATENED WITH
CONSUMPTION BUT I HAVE NOT INQUIRED AFTER HIM LATELY
THIS LADY THAT I
SPEAK OF CORRESPONDS WITH HIM I PRESUME AND WILL BE QUITE SURE TO LOOK
AFTER HIM
THIS LETTER ARRIVED A FEW DAYS AFTER IT WAS WRITTEN AND UP WENT MR
WILLIAMS'S STOCK AGAIN
MR
WARNER'S LOW DOWN SUSPICION WAS LAID IN THE
COLD COLD GRAVE WHERE IT APPARENTLY BELONGED
IT WAS A SUSPICION
BASED UPON MERE INTERNAL EVIDENCE ANYWAY AND WHEN YOU COME TO INTERNAL
EVIDENCE IT'S A BIG FIELD AND A GAME THAT TWO CAN PLAY AT AS WITNESS
THIS OTHER INTERNAL EVIDENCE DISCOVERED BY THE WRITER OF THE NOTE ABOVE
QUOTED THAT 'IT IS A WONDERFUL LETTER WHICH NO CHRISTIAN GENIUS MUCH
LESS ONE UNSANCTIFIED COULD EVER HAVE WRITTEN
I HAD PERMISSION NOW TO PRINT PROVIDED I SUPPRESSED NAMES AND PLACES
AND SENT MY NARRATIVE OUT OF THE COUNTRY
SO I CHOSE AN AUSTRALIAN
MAGAZINE FOR VEHICLE AS BEING FAR ENOUGH OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND SET
MYSELF TO WORK ON MY ARTICLE
AND THE MINISTERS SET THE PUMPS GOING
AGAIN WITH THE LETTER TO WORK THE HANDLES
BUT MEANTIME BROTHER PAGE HAD BEEN AGITATING
HE HAD NOT VISITED THE
PENITENTIARY BUT HE HAD SENT A COPY OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS LETTER TO
THE CHAPLAIN OF THAT INSTITUTION AND ACCOMPANIED IT WITH APPARENTLY
INQUIRIES
HE GOT AN ANSWER DATED FOUR DAYS LATER THAN THAT OTHER
BROTHER'S REASSURING EPISTLE AND BEFORE MY ARTICLE WAS COMPLETE IT
WANDERED INTO MY HANDS
THE ORIGINAL IS BEFORE ME NOW AND I HERE
APPEND IT
IT IS PRETTY WELL LOADED WITH INTERNAL EVIDENCE OF THE MOST
SOLID DESCRIPTION
STATE'S PRISON CHAPLAIN'S OFFICE JULY 11 1873
DEAR BRO
PAGE HEREWITH PLEASE FIND THE LETTER KINDLY LOANED ME
I AM AFRAID ITS GENUINENESS CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED
IT PURPORTS TO BE
ADDRESSED TO SOME PRISONER HERE
NO SUCH LETTER EVER CAME TO A PRISONER
HERE
ALL LETTERS RECEIVED ARE CAREFULLY READ BY OFFICERS OF THE PRISON
BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE HANDS OF THE CONVICTS AND ANY SUCH LETTER COULD
NOT BE FORGOTTEN
AGAIN CHARLES WILLIAMS IS NOT A CHRISTIAN MAN BUT A
DISSOLUTE CUNNING PRODIGAL WHOSE FATHER IS A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL
HIS NAME IS AN ASSUMED ONE
I AM GLAD TO HAVE MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
I AM PREPARING A LECTURE UPON LIFE SEEN THROUGH PRISON BARS AND SHOULD
LIKE TO DELIVER THE SAME IN YOUR VICINITY
AND SO ENDED THAT LITTLE DRAMA
MY POOR ARTICLE WENT INTO THE FIRE
FOR WHEREAS THE MATERIALS FOR IT WERE NOW MORE ABUNDANT AND INFINITELY
RICHER THAN THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN THERE WERE PARTIES ALL AROUND
ME WHO ALTHOUGH LONGING FOR THE PUBLICATION BEFORE WERE A UNIT
FOR SUPPRESSION AT THIS STAGE AND COMPLEXION OF THE GAME
THEY SAID
'WAIT THE WOUND IS TOO FRESH YET ALL THE COPIES OF THE FAMOUS
LETTER EXCEPT MINE DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY AND FROM THAT TIME ONWARD THE
AFORETIME SAME OLD DROUGHT SET IN IN THE CHURCHES
AS A RULE THE TOWN
WAS ON A SPACIOUS GRIN FOR A WHILE BUT THERE WERE PLACES IN IT WHERE
THE GRIN DID NOT APPEAR AND WHERE IT WAS DANGEROUS TO REFER TO THE
EX CONVICT'S LETTER
A WORD OF EXPLANATION
'JACK HUNT THE PROFESSED WRITER OF THE LETTER
WAS AN IMAGINARY PERSON
THE BURGLAR WILLIAMS HARVARD GRADUATE SON OF
A MINISTER WROTE THE LETTER HIMSELF TO HIMSELF GOT IT SMUGGLED OUT OF
THE PRISON GOT IT CONVEYED TO PERSONS WHO HAD SUPPORTED AND ENCOURAGED
HIM IN HIS CONVERSION WHERE HE KNEW TWO THINGS WOULD HAPPEN THE
GENUINENESS OF THE LETTER WOULD NOT BE DOUBTED OR INQUIRED INTO AND THE
NUB OF IT WOULD BE NOTICED AND WOULD HAVE VALUABLE EFFECT THE EFFECT
INDEED OF STARTING A MOVEMENT TO GET MR
WILLIAMS PARDONED OUT OF
PRISON
THAT 'NUB' IS SO INGENIOUSLY SO CASUALLY FLUNG IN AND IMMEDIATELY
LEFT THERE IN THE TAIL OF THE LETTER UNDWELT UPON THAT AN INDIFFERENT
READER WOULD NEVER SUSPECT THAT IT WAS THE HEART AND CORE OF THE
EPISTLE IF HE EVEN TOOK NOTE OF IT AT ALL THIS IS THE 'NUB'
'I HOPE THE WARM WEATHER IS DOING YOUR LUNGS GOOD I WAS AFRAID WHEN
YOU WAS BLEEDING YOU WOULD DIE GIVE MY RESPECTS ETC
THAT IS ALL THERE IS OF IT SIMPLY TOUCH AND GO NO DWELLING UPON IT
NEVERTHELESS IT WAS INTENDED FOR AN EYE THAT WOULD BE SWIFT TO SEE IT
AND IT WAS MEANT TO MOVE A KIND HEART TO TRY TO EFFECT THE LIBERATION
OF A POOR REFORMED AND PURIFIED FELLOW LYING IN THE FELL GRIP OF
CONSUMPTION
WHEN I FOR THE FIRST TIME HEARD THAT LETTER READ NINE YEARS AGO I FELT
THAT IT WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE ONE I HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED
AND IT
SO WARMED ME TOWARD MR
BROWN OF ST
LOUIS THAT I SAID THAT IF EVER I
VISITED THAT CITY AGAIN I WOULD SEEK OUT THAT EXCELLENT MAN AND KISS
THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT IF IT WAS A NEW ONE
WELL I VISITED ST
LOUIS
BUT I DID NOT HUNT FOR MR
BROWN FOR ALAS THE INVESTIGATIONS OF LONG
AGO HAD PROVED THAT THE BENEVOLENT BROWN LIKE 'JACK HUNT WAS NOT A
REAL PERSON BUT A SHEER INVENTION OF THAT GIFTED RASCAL WILLIAMS
BURGLAR HARVARD GRADUATE SON OF A CLERGYMAN
CHAPTER 53
MY BOYHOOD'S HOME
WE TOOK PASSAGE IN ONE OF THE FAST BOATS OF THE ST
LOUIS AND ST
PAUL
PACKET COMPANY AND STARTED UP THE RIVER
WHEN I AS A BOY FIRST SAW THE MOUTH OF THE MISSOURI RIVER IT WAS
TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE MILES ABOVE ST
LOUIS ACCORDING TO THE
ESTIMATE OF PILOTS THE WEAR AND TEAR OF THE BANKS HAVE MOVED IT DOWN
EIGHT MILES SINCE THEN AND THE PILOTS SAY THAT WITHIN FIVE YEARS THE
RIVER WILL CUT THROUGH AND MOVE THE MOUTH DOWN FIVE MILES MORE WHICH
WILL BRING IT WITHIN TEN MILES OF ST
LOUIS
ABOUT NIGHTFALL WE PASSED THE LARGE AND FLOURISHING TOWN OF ALTON
ILLINOIS AND BEFORE DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING THE TOWN OF LOUISIANA
MISSOURI A SLEEPY VILLAGE IN MY DAY BUT A BRISK RAILWAY CENTER NOW
HOWEVER ALL THE TOWNS OUT THERE ARE RAILWAY CENTERS NOW
I COULD NOT
CLEARLY RECOGNIZE THE PLACE
THIS SEEMED ODD TO ME FOR WHEN I RETIRED
FROM THE REBEL ARMY IN '61 I RETIRED UPON LOUISIANA IN GOOD ORDER AT
LEAST IN GOOD ENOUGH ORDER FOR A PERSON WHO HAD NOT YET LEARNED HOW
TO RETREAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF WAR AND HAD TO TRUST TO NATIVE
GENIUS
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT FOR A FIRST ATTEMPT AT A RETREAT IT WAS NOT
BADLY DONE
I HAD DONE NO ADVANCING IN ALL THAT CAMPAIGN THAT WAS AT ALL
EQUAL TO IT
THERE WAS A RAILWAY BRIDGE ACROSS THE RIVER HERE WELL SPRINKLED WITH
GLOWING LIGHTS AND A VERY BEAUTIFUL SIGHT IT WAS
AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING WE REACHED HANNIBAL MISSOURI WHERE MY BOYHOOD
WAS SPENT
I HAD HAD A GLIMPSE OF IT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND ANOTHER
GLIMPSE SIX YEARS EARLIER BUT BOTH WERE SO BRIEF THAT THEY HARDLY
COUNTED
THE ONLY NOTION OF THE TOWN THAT REMAINED IN MY MIND WAS THE
MEMORY OF IT AS I HAD KNOWN IT WHEN I FIRST QUITTED IT TWENTY NINE
YEARS AGO
THAT PICTURE OF IT WAS STILL AS CLEAR AND VIVID TO ME AS A
PHOTOGRAPH
I STEPPED ASHORE WITH THE FEELING OF ONE WHO RETURNS OUT OF
A DEAD AND GONE GENERATION
I HAD A SORT OF REALIZING SENSE OF WHAT THE
BASTILLE PRISONERS MUST HAVE FELT WHEN THEY USED TO COME OUT AND LOOK
UPON PARIS AFTER YEARS OF CAPTIVITY AND NOTE HOW CURIOUSLY THE FAMILIAR
AND THE STRANGE WERE MIXED TOGETHER BEFORE THEM
I SAW THE NEW HOUSES
SAW THEM PLAINLY ENOUGH BUT THEY DID NOT AFFECT THE OLDER PICTURE IN
MY MIND FOR THROUGH THEIR SOLID BRICKS AND MORTAR I SAW THE VANISHED
HOUSES WHICH HAD FORMERLY STOOD THERE WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS
IT WAS SUNDAY MORNING AND EVERYBODY WAS ABED YET
SO I PASSED THROUGH
THE VACANT STREETS STILL SEEING THE TOWN AS IT WAS AND NOT AS IT IS
AND RECOGNIZING AND METAPHORICALLY SHAKING HANDS WITH A HUNDRED FAMILIAR
OBJECTS WHICH NO LONGER EXIST AND FINALLY CLIMBED HOLIDAY'S HILL TO GET
A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW
THE WHOLE TOWN LAY SPREAD OUT BELOW ME THEN AND I
COULD MARK AND FIX EVERY LOCALITY EVERY DETAIL
NATURALLY I WAS A GOOD
DEAL MOVED
I SAID 'MANY OF THE PEOPLE I ONCE KNEW IN THIS TRANQUIL
REFUGE OF MY CHILDHOOD ARE NOW IN HEAVEN SOME I TRUST ARE IN THE
OTHER PLACE THE THINGS ABOUT ME AND BEFORE ME MADE ME FEEL LIKE A BOY
AGAIN CONVINCED ME THAT I WAS A BOY AGAIN AND THAT I HAD SIMPLY BEEN
DREAMING AN UNUSUALLY LONG DREAM BUT MY REFLECTIONS SPOILED ALL THAT
FOR THEY FORCED ME TO SAY 'I SEE FIFTY OLD HOUSES DOWN YONDER INTO
EACH OF WHICH I COULD ENTER AND FIND EITHER A MAN OR A WOMAN WHO WAS A
BABY OR UNBORN WHEN I NOTICED THOSE HOUSES LAST OR A GRANDMOTHER WHO
WAS A PLUMP YOUNG BRIDE AT THAT TIME
FROM THIS VANTAGE GROUND THE EXTENSIVE VIEW UP AND DOWN THE RIVER AND
WIDE OVER THE WOODED EXPANSES OF ILLINOIS IS VERY BEAUTIFUL ONE OF THE
MOST BEAUTIFUL ON THE MISSISSIPPI I THINK WHICH IS A HAZARDOUS REMARK
TO MAKE FOR THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILES OF RIVER BETWEEN ST
LOUIS AND ST
PAUL AFFORD AN UNBROKEN SUCCESSION OF LOVELY PICTURES
IT MAY BE THAT
MY AFFECTION FOR THE ONE IN QUESTION BIASES MY JUDGMENT IN ITS FAVOR I
CANNOT SAY AS TO THAT
NO MATTER IT WAS SATISFYINGLY BEAUTIFUL TO ME
AND IT HAD THIS ADVANTAGE OVER ALL THE OTHER FRIENDS WHOM I WAS ABOUT
TO GREET AGAIN IT HAD SUFFERED NO CHANGE IT WAS AS YOUNG AND FRESH
AND COMELY AND GRACIOUS AS EVER IT HAD BEEN WHEREAS THE FACES OF THE
OTHERS WOULD BE OLD AND SCARRED WITH THE CAMPAIGNS OF LIFE AND MARKED
WITH THEIR GRIEFS AND DEFEATS AND WOULD GIVE ME NO UPLIFTINGS OF
SPIRIT
AN OLD GENTLEMAN OUT ON AN EARLY MORNING WALK CAME ALONG AND WE
DISCUSSED THE WEATHER AND THEN DRIFTED INTO OTHER MATTERS
I COULD NOT
REMEMBER HIS FACE
HE SAID HE HAD BEEN LIVING HERE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS
SO HE HAD COME AFTER MY TIME AND I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE
I ASKED
HIM VARIOUS QUESTIONS FIRST ABOUT A MATE OF MINE IN SUNDAY SCHOOL WHAT
BECAME OF HIM
'HE GRADUATED WITH HONOR IN AN EASTERN COLLEGE WANDERED OFF INTO THE
WORLD SOMEWHERE SUCCEEDED AT NOTHING PASSED OUT OF KNOWLEDGE AND
MEMORY YEARS AGO AND IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE TO THE DOGS
'HE WAS BRIGHT AND PROMISED WELL WHEN HE WAS A BOY
'YES BUT THE THING THAT HAPPENED IS WHAT BECAME OF IT ALL
I ASKED AFTER ANOTHER LAD ALTOGETHER THE BRIGHTEST IN OUR VILLAGE
SCHOOL WHEN I WAS A BOY
'HE TOO WAS GRADUATED WITH HONORS FROM AN EASTERN COLLEGE BUT LIFE
WHIPPED HIM IN EVERY BATTLE STRAIGHT ALONG AND HE DIED IN ONE OF THE
TERRITORIES YEARS AGO A DEFEATED MAN
I ASKED AFTER ANOTHER OF THE BRIGHT BOYS
'HE IS A SUCCESS ALWAYS HAS BEEN ALWAYS WILL BE I THINK
I INQUIRED AFTER A YOUNG FELLOW WHO CAME TO THE TOWN TO STUDY FOR ONE OF
THE PROFESSIONS WHEN I WAS A BOY
'HE WENT AT SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE HE GOT THROUGH WENT FROM MEDICINE TO
LAW OR FROM LAW TO MEDICINE THEN TO SOME OTHER NEW THING WENT AWAY
FOR A YEAR CAME BACK WITH A YOUNG WIFE FELL TO DRINKING THEN TO
GAMBLING BEHIND THE DOOR FINALLY TOOK HIS WIFE AND TWO YOUNG CHILDREN
TO HER FATHER'S AND WENT OFF TO MEXICO WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE AND
FINALLY DIED THERE WITHOUT A CENT TO BUY A SHROUD AND WITHOUT A FRIEND
TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL
'PITY FOR HE WAS THE BEST NATURED AND MOST CHEERY AND HOPEFUL YOUNG
FELLOW THAT EVER WAS
I NAMED ANOTHER BOY
'OH HE IS ALL RIGHT
LIVES HERE YET HAS A WIFE AND CHILDREN AND IS
PROSPERING
SAME VERDICT CONCERNING OTHER BOYS
I NAMED THREE SCHOOL GIRLS
'THE FIRST TWO LIVE HERE ARE MARRIED AND HAVE CHILDREN THE OTHER IS
LONG AGO DEAD NEVER MARRIED
I NAMED WITH EMOTION ONE OF MY EARLY SWEETHEARTS
'SHE IS ALL RIGHT
BEEN MARRIED THREE TIMES BURIED TWO HUSBANDS
DIVORCED FROM THE THIRD AND I HEAR SHE IS GETTING READY TO MARRY AN OLD
FELLOW OUT IN COLORADO SOMEWHERE
SHE'S GOT CHILDREN SCATTERED AROUND
HERE AND THERE MOST EVERYWHERES
THE ANSWER TO SEVERAL OTHER INQUIRIES WAS BRIEF AND SIMPLE
'KILLED IN THE WAR
I NAMED ANOTHER BOY
'WELL NOW HIS CASE IS CURIOUS THERE WASN'T A HUMAN BEING IN THIS TOWN
BUT KNEW THAT THAT BOY WAS A PERFECT CHUCKLEHEAD PERFECT DUMMY JUST
A STUPID ASS AS YOU MAY SAY
EVERYBODY KNEW IT AND EVERYBODY SAID IT
WELL IF THAT VERY BOY ISN'T THE FIRST LAWYER IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI
TO DAY I'M A DEMOCRAT
'IS THAT SO
'IT'S ACTUALLY SO
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH
'HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR IT
'ACCOUNT FOR IT THERE AIN'T ANY ACCOUNTING FOR IT EXCEPT THAT IF YOU
SEND A DAMNED FOOL TO ST
LOUIS AND YOU DON'T TELL THEM HE'S A DAMNED
FOOL THEY'LL NEVER FIND IT OUT
THERE'S ONE THING SURE IF I HAD A
DAMNED FOOL I SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM SHIP HIM TO ST
LOUIS
IT'S THE NOBLEST MARKET IN THE WORLD FOR THAT KIND OF PROPERTY
WELL
WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT ALL AROUND AND CHEW AT IT AND THINK IT
OVER DON'T IT JUST BANG ANYTHING YOU EVER HEARD OF
'WELL YES IT DOES SEEM TO
BUT DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE IT WAS THE
HANNIBAL PEOPLE WHO WERE MISTAKEN ABOUT THE BOY AND NOT THE ST
LOUIS
PEOPLE
'OH NONSENSE THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE KNOWN HIM FROM THE VERY CRADLE
THEY KNEW HIM A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THAN THE ST
LOUIS IDIOTS COULD
HAVE KNOWN HIM
NO IF YOU HAVE GOT ANY DAMNED FOOLS THAT YOU WANT TO
REALIZE ON TAKE MY ADVICE SEND THEM TO ST
LOUIS
I MENTIONED A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHOM I HAD FORMERLY KNOWN
SOME
WERE DEAD SOME WERE GONE AWAY SOME HAD PROSPERED SOME HAD COME
TO NAUGHT BUT AS REGARDED A DOZEN OR SO OF THE LOT THE ANSWER WAS
COMFORTING
'PROSPEROUS LIVE HERE YET TOWN LITTERED WITH THEIR CHILDREN
I ASKED ABOUT MISS
DIED IN THE INSANE ASYLUM THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO NEVER WAS OUT OF IT
FROM THE TIME SHE WENT IN AND WAS ALWAYS SUFFERING TOO NEVER GOT A
SHRED OF HER MIND BACK
IF HE SPOKE THE TRUTH HERE WAS A HEAVY TRAGEDY INDEED
THIRTY SIX
YEARS IN A MADHOUSE THAT SOME YOUNG FOOLS MIGHT HAVE SOME FUN I WAS
A SMALL BOY AT THE TIME AND I SAW THOSE GIDDY YOUNG LADIES COME
TIPTOEING INTO THE ROOM WHERE MISS SAT READING AT MIDNIGHT BY A
LAMP
THE GIRL AT THE HEAD OF THE FILE WORE A SHROUD AND A DOUGHFACE
SHE CREPT BEHIND THE VICTIM TOUCHED HER ON THE SHOULDER AND SHE LOOKED
UP AND SCREAMED AND THEN FELL INTO CONVULSIONS
SHE DID NOT RECOVER
FROM THE FRIGHT BUT WENT MAD
IN THESE DAYS IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE THAT
PEOPLE BELIEVED IN GHOSTS SO SHORT A TIME AGO
BUT THEY DID
AFTER ASKING AFTER SUCH OTHER FOLK AS I COULD CALL TO MIND I FINALLY
INQUIRED ABOUT MYSELF
'OH HE SUCCEEDED WELL ENOUGH ANOTHER CASE OF DAMNED FOOL
IF THEY'D
SENT HIM TO ST
LOUIS HE'D HAVE SUCCEEDED SOONER
IT WAS WITH MUCH SATISFACTION THAT I RECOGNIZED THE WISDOM OF HAVING
TOLD THIS CANDID GENTLEMAN IN THE BEGINNING THAT MY NAME WAS SMITH
CHAPTER 54
PAST AND PRESENT
BEING LEFT TO MYSELF UP THERE I WENT ON PICKING OUT OLD HOUSES IN THE
DISTANT TOWN AND CALLING BACK THEIR FORMER INMATES OUT OF THE MOLDY
PAST
AMONG THEM I PRESENTLY RECOGNIZED THE HOUSE OF THE FATHER OF LEM
HACKETT FICTITIOUS NAME
IT CARRIED ME BACK MORE THAN A GENERATION IN
A MOMENT AND LANDED ME IN THE MIDST OF A TIME WHEN THE HAPPENINGS OF
LIFE WERE NOT THE NATURAL AND LOGICAL RESULTS OF GREAT GENERAL LAWS
BUT OF SPECIAL ORDERS AND WERE FREIGHTED WITH VERY PRECISE AND DISTINCT
PURPOSES PARTLY PUNITIVE IN INTENT PARTLY ADMONITORY AND USUALLY
LOCAL IN APPLICATION
WHEN I WAS A SMALL BOY LEM HACKETT WAS DROWNED ON A SUNDAY
HE FELL
OUT OF AN EMPTY FLAT BOAT WHERE HE WAS PLAYING
BEING LOADED WITH SIN
HE WENT TO THE BOTTOM LIKE AN ANVIL
HE WAS THE ONLY BOY IN THE VILLAGE
WHO SLEPT THAT NIGHT
WE OTHERS ALL LAY AWAKE REPENTING
WE HAD NOT
NEEDED THE INFORMATION DELIVERED FROM THE PULPIT THAT EVENING THAT
LEM'S WAS A CASE OF SPECIAL JUDGMENT WE KNEW THAT ALREADY
THERE WAS
A FEROCIOUS THUNDER STORM THAT NIGHT AND IT RAGED CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL
NEAR DAWN
THE WINDS BLEW THE WINDOWS RATTLED THE RAIN SWEPT ALONG
THE ROOF IN PELTING SHEETS AND AT THE BRIEFEST OF INTERVALS THE INKY
BLACKNESS OF THE NIGHT VANISHED THE HOUSES OVER THE WAY GLARED OUT
WHITE AND BLINDING FOR A QUIVERING INSTANT THEN THE SOLID DARKNESS SHUT
DOWN AGAIN AND A SPLITTING PEAL OF THUNDER FOLLOWED WHICH SEEMED TO
REND EVERYTHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO SHREDS AND SPLINTERS
I SAT UP
IN BED QUAKING AND SHUDDERING WAITING FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WORLD
AND EXPECTING IT
TO ME THERE WAS NOTHING STRANGE OR INCONGRUOUS IN
HEAVEN'S MAKING SUCH AN UPROAR ABOUT LEM HACKETT
APPARENTLY IT WAS THE
RIGHT AND PROPER THING TO DO
NOT A DOUBT ENTERED MY MIND THAT ALL THE
ANGELS WERE GROUPED TOGETHER DISCUSSING THIS BOY'S CASE AND OBSERVING
THE AWFUL BOMBARDMENT OF OUR BEGGARLY LITTLE VILLAGE WITH SATISFACTION
AND APPROVAL
THERE WAS ONE THING WHICH DISTURBED ME IN THE MOST SERIOUS
WAY THAT WAS THE THOUGHT THAT THIS CENTERING OF THE CELESTIAL INTEREST
ON OUR VILLAGE COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE OBSERVERS
TO PEOPLE AMONG US WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE ESCAPED NOTICE FOR YEARS
I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE BUT THE VERY ONE MOST
LIKELY TO BE DISCOVERED
THAT DISCOVERY COULD HAVE BUT ONE RESULT I
SHOULD BE IN THE FIRE WITH LEM BEFORE THE CHILL OF THE RIVER HAD BEEN
FAIRLY WARMED OUT OF HIM
I KNEW THAT THIS WOULD BE ONLY JUST AND FAIR
I WAS INCREASING THE CHANCES AGAINST MYSELF ALL THE TIME BY FEELING A
SECRET BITTERNESS AGAINST LEM FOR HAVING ATTRACTED THIS FATAL ATTENTION
TO ME BUT I COULD NOT HELP IT THIS SINFUL THOUGHT PERSISTED IN
INFESTING MY BREAST IN SPITE OF ME
EVERY TIME THE LIGHTNING GLARED
I CAUGHT MY BREATH AND JUDGED I WAS GONE
IN MY TERROR AND MISERY I
MEANLY BEGAN TO SUGGEST OTHER BOYS AND MENTION ACTS OF THEIRS WHICH
WERE WICKEDER THAN MINE AND PECULIARLY NEEDED PUNISHMENT AND I TRIED
TO PRETEND TO MYSELF THAT I WAS SIMPLY DOING THIS IN A CASUAL WAY AND
WITHOUT INTENT TO DIVERT THE HEAVENLY ATTENTION TO THEM FOR THE PURPOSE
OF GETTING RID OF IT MYSELF
WITH DEEP SAGACITY I PUT THESE
MENTIONS INTO THE FORM OF SORROWING RECOLLECTIONS AND LEFT HANDED
SHAM SUPPLICATIONS THAT THE SINS OF THOSE BOYS MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO PASS
UNNOTICED 'POSSIBLY THEY MAY REPENT 'IT IS TRUE THAT JIM SMITH BROKE
A WINDOW AND LIED ABOUT IT BUT MAYBE HE DID NOT MEAN ANY HARM
AND
ALTHOUGH TOM HOLMES SAYS MORE BAD WORDS THAN ANY OTHER BOY IN THE
VILLAGE HE PROBABLY INTENDS TO REPENT THOUGH HE HAS NEVER SAID HE
WOULD
AND WHILST IT IS A FACT THAT JOHN JONES DID FISH A LITTLE ON
SUNDAY ONCE HE DIDN'T REALLY CATCH ANYTHING BUT ONLY JUST ONE SMALL
USELESS MUD CAT AND MAYBE THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO AWFUL IF HE HAD
THROWN IT BACK AS HE SAYS HE DID BUT HE DIDN'T
PITY BUT THEY WOULD
REPENT OF THESE DREADFUL THINGS AND MAYBE THEY WILL YET
BUT WHILE I WAS SHAMEFULLY TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THESE POOR
CHAPS WHO WERE DOUBTLESS DIRECTING THE CELESTIAL ATTENTION TO ME AT THE
SAME MOMENT THOUGH I NEVER ONCE SUSPECTED THAT I HAD HEEDLESSLY
LEFT MY CANDLE BURNING
IT WAS NOT A TIME TO NEGLECT EVEN TRIFLING
PRECAUTIONS
THERE WAS NO OCCASION TO ADD ANYTHING TO THE FACILITIES FOR
ATTRACTING NOTICE TO ME SO I PUT THE LIGHT OUT
IT WAS A LONG NIGHT TO ME AND PERHAPS THE MOST DISTRESSFUL ONE I
EVER SPENT
I ENDURED AGONIES OF REMORSE FOR SINS WHICH I KNEW I HAD
COMMITTED AND FOR OTHERS WHICH I WAS NOT CERTAIN ABOUT YET WAS SURE
THAT THEY HAD BEEN SET DOWN AGAINST ME IN A BOOK BY AN ANGEL WHO WAS
WISER THAN I AND DID NOT TRUST SUCH IMPORTANT MATTERS TO MEMORY
IT STRUCK ME BY AND BY THAT I HAD BEEN MAKING A MOST FOOLISH AND
CALAMITOUS MISTAKE IN ONE RESPECT DOUBTLESS I HAD NOT ONLY MADE MY
OWN DESTRUCTION SURE BY DIRECTING ATTENTION TO THOSE OTHER BOYS BUT HAD
ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED THEIRS DOUBTLESS THE LIGHTNING HAD STRETCHED THEM
ALL DEAD IN THEIR BEDS BY THIS TIME THE ANGUISH AND THE FRIGHT WHICH
THIS THOUGHT GAVE ME MADE MY PREVIOUS SUFFERINGS SEEM TRIFLING BY
COMPARISON
THINGS HAD BECOME TRULY SERIOUS
I RESOLVED TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF
INSTANTLY I ALSO RESOLVED TO CONNECT MYSELF WITH THE CHURCH THE NEXT
DAY IF I SURVIVED TO SEE ITS SUN APPEAR
I RESOLVED TO CEASE FROM SIN
IN ALL ITS FORMS AND TO LEAD A HIGH AND BLAMELESS LIFE FOR EVER AFTER
I WOULD BE PUNCTUAL AT CHURCH AND SUNDAY SCHOOL VISIT THE SICK
CARRY BASKETS OF VICTUALS TO THE POOR SIMPLY TO FULFIL THE REGULATION
CONDITIONS ALTHOUGH I KNEW WE HAD NONE AMONG US SO POOR BUT THEY WOULD
SMASH THE BASKET OVER MY HEAD FOR MY PAINS I WOULD INSTRUCT OTHER BOYS
IN RIGHT WAYS AND TAKE THE RESULTING TROUNCINGS MEEKLY I WOULD SUBSIST
ENTIRELY ON TRACTS I WOULD INVADE THE RUM SHOP AND WARN THE DRUNKARD
AND FINALLY IF I ESCAPED THE FATE OF THOSE WHO EARLY BECOME TOO GOOD TO
LIVE I WOULD GO FOR A MISSIONARY
THE STORM SUBSIDED TOWARD DAYBREAK AND I DOZED GRADUALLY TO SLEEP WITH
A SENSE OF OBLIGATION TO LEM HACKETT FOR GOING TO ETERNAL SUFFERING IN
THAT ABRUPT WAY AND THUS PREVENTING A FAR MORE DREADFUL DISASTER MY
OWN LOSS
BUT WHEN I ROSE REFRESHED BY AND BY AND FOUND THAT THOSE OTHER BOYS
WERE STILL ALIVE I HAD A DIM SENSE THAT PERHAPS THE WHOLE THING WAS
A FALSE ALARM THAT THE ENTIRE TURMOIL HAD BEEN ON LEM'S ACCOUNT AND
NOBODY'S ELSE
THE WORLD LOOKED SO BRIGHT AND SAFE THAT THERE DID NOT
SEEM TO BE ANY REAL OCCASION TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF
I WAS A LITTLE
SUBDUED DURING THAT DAY AND PERHAPS THE NEXT AFTER THAT MY PURPOSE
OF REFORMING SLOWLY DROPPED OUT OF MY MIND AND I HAD A PEACEFUL
COMFORTABLE TIME AGAIN UNTIL THE NEXT STORM
THAT STORM CAME ABOUT THREE WEEKS LATER AND IT WAS THE MOST
UNACCOUNTABLE ONE TO ME THAT I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FOR ON THE
AFTERNOON OF THAT DAY 'DUTCHY' WAS DROWNED
DUTCHY BELONGED TO OUR
SUNDAY SCHOOL
HE WAS A GERMAN LAD WHO DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH TO COME IN
OUT OF THE RAIN BUT HE WAS EXASPERATINGLY GOOD AND HAD A PRODIGIOUS
MEMORY
ONE SUNDAY HE MADE HIMSELF THE ENVY OF ALL THE YOUTH AND THE
TALK OF ALL THE ADMIRING VILLAGE BY RECITING THREE THOUSAND VERSES OF
SCRIPTURE WITHOUT MISSING A WORD THEN HE WENT OFF THE VERY NEXT DAY AND
GOT DROWNED
CIRCUMSTANCES GAVE TO HIS DEATH A PECULIAR IMPRESSIVENESS
WE WERE ALL
BATHING IN A MUDDY CREEK WHICH HAD A DEEP HOLE IN IT AND IN THIS HOLE
THE COOPERS HAD SUNK A PILE OF GREEN HICKORY HOOP POLES TO SOAK SOME
TWELVE FEET UNDER WATER
WE WERE DIVING AND 'SEEING WHO COULD STAY UNDER
LONGEST WE MANAGED TO REMAIN DOWN BY HOLDING ON TO THE HOOP POLES
DUTCHY MADE SUCH A POOR SUCCESS OF IT THAT HE WAS HAILED WITH LAUGHTER
AND DERISION EVERY TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED ABOVE WATER
AT LAST HE SEEMED
HURT WITH THE TAUNTS AND BEGGED US TO STAND STILL ON THE BANK AND BE
FAIR WITH HIM AND GIVE HIM AN HONEST COUNT 'BE FRIENDLY AND KIND JUST
THIS ONCE AND NOT MISCOUNT FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING THE FUN OF LAUGHING
AT HIM TREACHEROUS WINKS WERE EXCHANGED AND ALL SAID 'ALL RIGHT
DUTCHY GO AHEAD WE'LL PLAY FAIR
DUTCHY PLUNGED IN BUT THE BOYS INSTEAD OF BEGINNING TO COUNT FOLLOWED
THE LEAD OF ONE OF THEIR NUMBER AND SCAMPERED TO A RANGE OF BLACKBERRY
BUSHES CLOSE BY AND HID BEHIND IT
THEY IMAGINED DUTCHY'S HUMILIATION
WHEN HE SHOULD RISE AFTER A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT AND FIND THE PLACE SILENT
AND VACANT NOBODY THERE TO APPLAUD
THEY WERE 'SO FULL OF LAUGH' WITH
THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE CONTINUALLY EXPLODING INTO MUFFLED CACKLES
TIME SWEPT ON AND PRESENTLY ONE WHO WAS PEEPING THROUGH THE BRIERS
SAID WITH SURPRISE
'WHY HE HASN'T COME UP YET
THE LAUGHING STOPPED
'BOYS IT 'S A SPLENDID DIVE SAID ONE
'NEVER MIND THAT SAID ANOTHER 'THE JOKE ON HIM IS ALL THE BETTER FOR
IT
THERE WAS A REMARK OR TWO MORE AND THEN A PAUSE
TALKING CEASED AND
ALL BEGAN TO PEER THROUGH THE VINES
BEFORE LONG THE BOYS' FACES
BEGAN TO LOOK UNEASY THEN ANXIOUS THEN TERRIFIED
STILL THERE WAS NO
MOVEMENT OF THE PLACID WATER
HEARTS BEGAN TO BEAT FAST AND FACES
TO TURN PALE
WE ALL GLIDED OUT SILENTLY AND STOOD ON THE BANK OUR
HORRIFIED EYES WANDERING BACK AND FORTH FROM EACH OTHER'S COUNTENANCES
TO THE WATER
'SOMEBODY MUST GO DOWN AND SEE
YES THAT WAS PLAIN BUT NOBODY WANTED THAT GRISLY TASK
'DRAW STRAWS
SO WE DID WITH HANDS WHICH SHOOK SO THAT WE HARDLY KNEW WHAT WE WERE
ABOUT
THE LOT FELL TO ME AND I WENT DOWN
THE WATER WAS SO MUDDY I
COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING BUT I FELT AROUND AMONG THE HOOP POLES AND
PRESENTLY GRASPED A LIMP WRIST WHICH GAVE ME NO RESPONSE AND IF IT
HAD I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN IT I LET IT GO WITH SUCH A FRIGHTENED
SUDDENNESS
THE BOY HAD BEEN CAUGHT AMONG THE HOOP POLES AND ENTANGLED THERE
HELPLESSLY
I FLED TO THE SURFACE AND TOLD THE AWFUL NEWS
SOME OF
US KNEW THAT IF THE BOY WERE DRAGGED OUT AT ONCE HE MIGHT POSSIBLY
BE RESUSCITATED BUT WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
WE DID NOT THINK OF
ANYTHING WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO WE DID NOTHING EXCEPT THAT THE
SMALLER LADS CRIED PITEOUSLY AND WE ALL STRUGGLED FRANTICALLY INTO
OUR CLOTHES PUTTING ON ANYBODY'S THAT CAME HANDY AND GETTING THEM
WRONG SIDE OUT AND UPSIDE DOWN AS A RULE
THEN WE SCURRIED AWAY AND
GAVE THE ALARM BUT NONE OF US WENT BACK TO SEE THE END OF THE TRAGEDY
WE HAD A MORE IMPORTANT THING TO ATTEND TO WE ALL FLEW HOME AND LOST
NOT A MOMENT IN GETTING READY TO LEAD A BETTER LIFE
THE NIGHT PRESENTLY CLOSED DOWN
THEN CAME ON THAT TREMENDOUS AND
UTTERLY UNACCOUNTABLE STORM
I WAS PERFECTLY DAZED I COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND IT
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE
THE
ELEMENTS WERE TURNED LOOSE AND THEY RATTLED AND BANGED AND BLAZED AWAY
IN THE MOST BLIND AND FRANTIC MANNER
ALL HEART AND HOPE WENT OUT OF
ME AND THE DISMAL THOUGHT KEPT FLOATING THROUGH MY BRAIN 'IF A BOY WHO
KNOWS THREE THOUSAND VERSES BY HEART IS NOT SATISFACTORY WHAT CHANCE IS
THERE FOR ANYBODY ELSE
OF COURSE I NEVER QUESTIONED FOR A MOMENT THAT THE STORM WAS ON DUTCHY'S
ACCOUNT OR THAT HE OR ANY OTHER INCONSEQUENTIAL ANIMAL WAS WORTHY OF
SUCH A MAJESTIC DEMONSTRATION FROM ON HIGH THE LESSON OF IT WAS THE
ONLY THING THAT TROUBLED ME FOR IT CONVINCED ME THAT IF DUTCHY WITH
ALL HIS PERFECTIONS WAS NOT A DELIGHT IT WOULD BE VAIN FOR ME TO TURN
OVER A NEW LEAF FOR I MUST INFALLIBLY FALL HOPELESSLY SHORT OF THAT
BOY NO MATTER HOW HARD I MIGHT TRY
NEVERTHELESS I DID TURN IT OVER A
HIGHLY EDUCATED FEAR COMPELLED ME TO DO THAT BUT SUCCEEDING DAYS OF
CHEERFULNESS AND SUNSHINE CAME BOTHERING AROUND AND WITHIN A MONTH
I HAD SO DRIFTED BACKWARD THAT AGAIN I WAS AS LOST AND COMFORTABLE AS
EVER
BREAKFAST TIME APPROACHED WHILE I MUSED THESE MUSINGS AND CALLED THESE
ANCIENT HAPPENINGS BACK TO MIND SO I GOT ME BACK INTO THE PRESENT AND
WENT DOWN THE HILL
ON MY WAY THROUGH TOWN TO THE HOTEL I SAW THE HOUSE WHICH WAS MY HOME
WHEN I WAS A BOY
AT PRESENT RATES THE PEOPLE WHO NOW OCCUPY IT ARE OF
NO MORE VALUE THAN I AM BUT IN MY TIME THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH NOT
LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS APIECE
THEY ARE COLORED FOLK
AFTER BREAKFAST I WENT OUT ALONE AGAIN INTENDING TO HUNT UP SOME OF
THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS AND SEE HOW THIS GENERATION OF PUPILS MIGHT COMPARE
WITH THEIR PROGENITORS WHO HAD SAT WITH ME IN THOSE PLACES AND HAD
PROBABLY TAKEN ME AS A MODEL THOUGH I DO NOT REMEMBER AS TO THAT NOW
BY THE PUBLIC SQUARE THERE HAD BEEN IN MY DAY A SHABBY LITTLE BRICK
CHURCH CALLED THE 'OLD SHIP OF ZION WHICH I HAD ATTENDED AS A
SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHOLAR AND I FOUND THE LOCALITY EASILY ENOUGH BUT NOT
THE OLD CHURCH IT WAS GONE AND A TRIG AND RATHER HILARIOUS NEW EDIFICE
WAS IN ITS PLACE
THE PUPILS WERE BETTER DRESSED AND BETTER LOOKING
THAN WERE THOSE OF MY TIME CONSEQUENTLY THEY DID NOT RESEMBLE THEIR
ANCESTORS AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WAS NOTHING FAMILIAR TO ME IN THEIR
FACES
STILL I CONTEMPLATED THEM WITH A DEEP INTEREST AND A YEARNING
WISTFULNESS AND IF I HAD BEEN A GIRL I WOULD HAVE CRIED FOR THEY WERE
THE OFFSPRING AND REPRESENTED AND OCCUPIED THE PLACES OF BOYS AND
GIRLS SOME OF WHOM I HAD LOVED TO LOVE AND SOME OF WHOM I HAD LOVED TO
HATE BUT ALL OF WHOM WERE DEAR TO ME FOR THE ONE REASON OR THE OTHER
SO MANY YEARS GONE BY AND LORD WHERE BE THEY NOW
I WAS MIGHTILY STIRRED AND WOULD HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL TO BE ALLOWED TO
REMAIN UNMOLESTED AND LOOK MY FILL BUT A BALD SUMMITED SUPERINTENDENT
WHO HAD BEEN A TOW HEADED SUNDAY SCHOOL MATE OF MINE ON THAT SPOT IN THE
EARLY AGES RECOGNIZED ME AND I TALKED A FLUTTER OF WILD NONSENSE TO
THOSE CHILDREN TO HIDE THE THOUGHTS WHICH WERE IN ME AND WHICH COULD
NOT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN WITHOUT A BETRAYAL OF FEELING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
RECOGNIZED AS OUT OF CHARACTER WITH ME
MAKING SPEECHES WITHOUT PREPARATION IS NO GIFT OF MINE AND I WAS
RESOLVED TO SHIRK ANY NEW OPPORTUNITY BUT IN THE NEXT AND LARGER
SUNDAY SCHOOL I FOUND MYSELF IN THE REAR OF THE ASSEMBLAGE SO I WAS
VERY WILLING TO GO ON THE PLATFORM A MOMENT FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING A
GOOD LOOK AT THE SCHOLARS
ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT I COULD NOT RECALL
ANY OF THE OLD IDIOTIC TALKS WHICH VISITORS USED TO INSULT ME WITH WHEN
I WAS A PUPIL THERE AND I WAS SORRY FOR THIS SINCE IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN
ME TIME AND EXCUSE TO DAWDLE THERE AND TAKE A LONG AND SATISFYING LOOK
AT WHAT I FEEL AT LIBERTY TO SAY WAS AN ARRAY OF FRESH YOUNG COMELINESS
NOT MATCHABLE IN ANOTHER SUNDAY SCHOOL OF THE SAME SIZE
AS I TALKED
MERELY TO GET A CHANCE TO INSPECT AND AS I STRUNG OUT THE RANDOM
RUBBISH SOLELY TO PROLONG THE INSPECTION I JUDGED IT BUT DECENT TO
CONFESS THESE LOW MOTIVES AND I DID SO
IF THE MODEL BOY WAS IN EITHER OF THESE SUNDAY SCHOOLS I DID NOT SEE
HIM
THE MODEL BOY OF MY TIME WE NEVER HAD BUT THE ONE WAS PERFECT
PERFECT IN MANNERS PERFECT IN DRESS PERFECT IN CONDUCT PERFECT IN
FILIAL PIETY PERFECT IN EXTERIOR GODLINESS BUT AT BOTTOM HE WAS A
PRIG AND AS FOR THE CONTENTS OF HIS SKULL THEY COULD HAVE CHANGED
PLACE WITH THE CONTENTS OF A PIE AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORSE
OFF FOR IT BUT THE PIE
THIS FELLOW'S REPROACHLESSNESS WAS A STANDING
REPROACH TO EVERY LAD IN THE VILLAGE
HE WAS THE ADMIRATION OF ALL THE
MOTHERS AND THE DETESTATION OF ALL THEIR SONS
I WAS TOLD WHAT BECAME
OF HIM BUT AS IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME I WILL NOT ENTER INTO
DETAILS
HE SUCCEEDED IN LIFE
CHAPTER 55
A VENDETTA AND OTHER THINGS
DURING MY THREE DAYS' STAY IN THE TOWN I WOKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH THE
IMPRESSION THAT I WAS A BOY FOR IN MY DREAMS THE FACES WERE ALL YOUNG
AGAIN AND LOOKED AS THEY HAD LOOKED IN THE OLD TIMES BUT I WENT TO BED
A HUNDRED YEARS OLD EVERY NIGHT FOR MEANTIME I HAD BEEN SEEING THOSE
FACES AS THEY ARE NOW
OF COURSE I SUFFERED SOME SURPRISES ALONG AT FIRST BEFORE I HAD BECOME
ADJUSTED TO THE CHANGED STATE OF THINGS
I MET YOUNG LADIES WHO DID NOT
SEEM TO HAVE CHANGED AT ALL BUT THEY TURNED OUT TO BE THE DAUGHTERS OF
THE YOUNG LADIES I HAD IN MIND SOMETIMES THEIR GRAND DAUGHTERS
WHEN
YOU ARE TOLD THAT A STRANGER OF FIFTY IS A GRANDMOTHER THERE IS NOTHING
SURPRISING ABOUT IT BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY SHE IS A PERSON WHOM YOU
KNEW AS A LITTLE GIRL IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE
YOU SAY TO YOURSELF 'HOW
CAN A LITTLE GIRL BE A GRANDMOTHER IT TAKES SOME LITTLE TIME TO ACCEPT
AND REALIZE THE FACT THAT WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN GROWING OLD YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE NOT BEEN STANDING STILL IN THAT MATTER
I NOTICED THAT THE GREATEST CHANGES OBSERVABLE WERE WITH THE WOMEN NOT
THE MEN
I SAW MEN WHOM THIRTY YEARS HAD CHANGED BUT SLIGHTLY BUT THEIR
WIVES HAD GROWN OLD
THESE WERE GOOD WOMEN IT IS VERY WEARING TO BE
GOOD
THERE WAS A SADDLER WHOM I WISHED TO SEE BUT HE WAS GONE
DEAD THESE
MANY YEARS THEY SAID
ONCE OR TWICE A DAY THE SADDLER USED TO GO
TEARING DOWN THE STREET PUTTING ON HIS COAT AS HE WENT AND THEN
EVERYBODY KNEW A STEAMBOAT WAS COMING
EVERYBODY KNEW ALSO THAT JOHN
STAVELY WAS NOT EXPECTING ANYBODY BY THE BOAT OR ANY FREIGHT EITHER
AND STAVELY MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT EVERYBODY KNEW THIS STILL IT MADE NO
DIFFERENCE TO HIM HE LIKED TO SEEM TO HIMSELF TO BE EXPECTING A HUNDRED
THOUSAND TONS OF SADDLES BY THIS BOAT AND SO HE WENT ON ALL HIS LIFE
ENJOYING BEING FAITHFULLY ON HAND TO RECEIVE AND RECEIPT FOR THOSE
SADDLES IN CASE BY ANY MIRACLE THEY SHOULD COME
A MALICIOUS QUINCY
PAPER USED ALWAYS TO REFER TO THIS TOWN IN DERISION AS 'STAVELY'S
LANDING STAVELY WAS ONE OF MY EARLIEST ADMIRATIONS I ENVIED HIM HIS
RUSH OF IMAGINARY BUSINESS AND THE DISPLAY HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE OF IT
BEFORE STRANGERS AS HE WENT FLYING DOWN THE STREET STRUGGLING WITH HIS
FLUTTERING COAT
BUT THERE WAS A CARPENTER WHO WAS MY CHIEFEST HERO
HE WAS A MIGHTY
LIAR BUT I DID NOT KNOW THAT I BELIEVED EVERYTHING HE SAID
HE WAS A
ROMANTIC SENTIMENTAL MELODRAMATIC FRAUD AND HIS BEARING IMPRESSED
ME WITH AWE
I VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME HE TOOK ME INTO HIS
CONFIDENCE
HE WAS PLANING A BOARD AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WOULD
PAUSE AND HEAVE A DEEP SIGH AND OCCASIONALLY MUTTER BROKEN SENTENCES
CONFUSED AND NOT INTELLIGIBLE BUT OUT OF THEIR MIDST AN EJACULATION
SOMETIMES ESCAPED WHICH MADE ME SHIVER AND DID ME GOOD ONE WAS 'O GOD
IT IS HIS BLOOD I SAT ON THE TOOL CHEST AND HUMBLY AND SHUDDERINGLY
ADMIRED HIM FOR I JUDGED HE WAS FULL OF CRIME
AT LAST HE SAID IN A LOW
VOICE
'MY LITTLE FRIEND CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET
I EAGERLY SAID I COULD
'A DARK AND DREADFUL ONE
I SATISFIED HIM ON THAT POINT
'THEN I WILL TELL YOU SOME PASSAGES IN MY HISTORY FOR OH I MUST
RELIEVE MY BURDENED SOUL OR I SHALL DIE
HE CAUTIONED ME ONCE MORE TO BE 'AS SILENT AS THE GRAVE THEN HE TOLD
ME HE WAS A 'RED HANDED MURDERER HE PUT DOWN HIS PLANE HELD HIS HANDS
OUT BEFORE HIM CONTEMPLATED THEM SADLY AND SAID
'LOOK WITH THESE HANDS I HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF THIRTY HUMAN BEINGS
THE EFFECT WHICH THIS HAD UPON ME WAS AN INSPIRATION TO HIM AND HE
TURNED HIMSELF LOOSE UPON HIS SUBJECT WITH INTEREST AND ENERGY
HE
LEFT GENERALIZING AND WENT INTO DETAILS BEGAN WITH HIS FIRST MURDER
DESCRIBED IT TOLD WHAT MEASURES HE HAD TAKEN TO AVERT SUSPICION THEN
PASSED TO HIS SECOND HOMICIDE HIS THIRD HIS FOURTH AND SO ON
HE HAD
ALWAYS DONE HIS MURDERS WITH A BOWIE KNIFE AND HE MADE ALL MY HAIRS
RISE BY SUDDENLY SNATCHING IT OUT AND SHOWING IT TO ME
AT THE END OF THIS FIRST SEANCE I WENT HOME WITH SIX OF HIS FEARFUL
SECRETS AMONG MY FREIGHTAGE AND FOUND THEM A GREAT HELP TO MY DREAMS
WHICH HAD BEEN SLUGGISH FOR A WHILE BACK
I SOUGHT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN
ON MY SATURDAY HOLIDAYS IN FACT I SPENT THE SUMMER WITH HIM ALL OF
IT WHICH WAS VALUABLE TO ME
HIS FASCINATIONS NEVER DIMINISHED FOR
HE THREW SOMETHING FRESH AND STIRRING IN THE WAY OF HORROR INTO EACH
SUCCESSIVE MURDER
HE ALWAYS GAVE NAMES DATES PLACES EVERYTHING
THIS
BY AND BY ENABLED ME TO NOTE TWO THINGS THAT HE HAD KILLED HIS VICTIMS
IN EVERY QUARTER OF THE GLOBE AND THAT THESE VICTIMS WERE ALWAYS NAMED
LYNCH
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE LYNCHES WENT SERENELY ON SATURDAY AFTER
SATURDAY UNTIL THE ORIGINAL THIRTY HAD MULTIPLIED TO SIXTY AND MORE TO
BE HEARD FROM YET THEN MY CURIOSITY GOT THE BETTER OF MY TIMIDITY AND
I ASKED HOW IT HAPPENED THAT THESE JUSTLY PUNISHED PERSONS ALL BORE THE
SAME NAME
MY HERO SAID HE HAD NEVER DIVULGED THAT DARK SECRET TO ANY LIVING BEING
BUT FELT THAT HE COULD TRUST ME AND THEREFORE HE WOULD LAY BARE BEFORE
ME THE STORY OF HIS SAD AND BLIGHTED LIFE
HE HAD LOVED ONE 'TOO FAIR
FOR EARTH AND SHE HAD RECIPROCATED 'WITH ALL THE SWEET AFFECTION OF
HER PURE AND NOBLE NATURE BUT HE HAD A RIVAL A 'BASE HIRELING' NAMED
ARCHIBALD LYNCH WHO SAID THE GIRL SHOULD BE HIS OR HE WOULD 'DYE HIS
HANDS IN HER HEART'S BEST BLOOD THE CARPENTER 'INNOCENT AND HAPPY
IN LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM GAVE NO WEIGHT TO THE THREAT BUT LED HIS
'GOLDEN HAIRED DARLING TO THE ALTAR AND THERE THE TWO WERE MADE ONE
THERE ALSO JUST AS THE MINISTER'S HANDS WERE STRETCHED IN BLESSING OVER
THEIR HEADS THE FELL DEED WAS DONE WITH A KNIFE AND THE BRIDE FELL
A CORPSE AT HER HUSBAND'S FEET
AND WHAT DID THE HUSBAND DO HE PLUCKED
FORTH THAT KNIFE AND KNEELING BY THE BODY OF HIS LOST ONE SWORE TO
'CONSECRATE HIS LIFE TO THE EXTERMINATION OF ALL THE HUMAN SCUM THAT
BEAR THE HATED NAME OF LYNCH
THAT WAS IT
HE HAD BEEN HUNTING DOWN THE LYNCHES AND SLAUGHTERING
THEM FROM THAT DAY TO THIS TWENTY YEARS
HE HAD ALWAYS USED THAT SAME
CONSECRATED KNIFE WITH IT HE HAD MURDERED HIS LONG ARRAY OF LYNCHES
AND WITH IT HE HAD LEFT UPON THE FOREHEAD OF EACH VICTIM A PECULIAR
MARK A CROSS DEEPLY INCISED
SAID HE
'THE CROSS OF THE MYSTERIOUS AVENGER IS KNOWN IN EUROPE IN AMERICA
IN CHINA IN SIAM IN THE TROPICS IN THE POLAR SEAS IN THE DESERTS OF
ASIA IN ALL THE EARTH
WHEREVER IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE GLOBE
A LYNCH HAS PENETRATED THERE HAS THE MYSTERIOUS CROSS BEEN SEEN AND
THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN IT HAVE SHUDDERED AND SAID IT IS HIS MARK HE HAS
BEEN HERE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE MYSTERIOUS AVENGER LOOK UPON HIM FOR
BEFORE YOU STANDS NO LESS A PERSON BUT BEWARE BREATHE NOT A WORD TO
ANY SOUL
BE SILENT AND WAIT
SOME MORNING THIS TOWN WILL FLOCK AGHAST
TO VIEW A GORY CORPSE ON ITS BROW WILL BE SEEN THE AWFUL SIGN AND
MEN WILL TREMBLE AND WHISPER HE HAS BEEN HERE IT IS THE MYSTERIOUS
AVENGER'S MARK YOU WILL COME HERE BUT I SHALL HAVE VANISHED YOU WILL
SEE ME NO MORE
THIS ASS HAD BEEN READING THE 'JIBBENAINOSAY NO DOUBT AND HAD HAD
HIS POOR ROMANTIC HEAD TURNED BY IT BUT AS I HAD NOT YET SEEN THE BOOK
THEN I TOOK HIS INVENTIONS FOR TRUTH AND DID NOT SUSPECT THAT HE WAS A
PLAGIARIST
HOWEVER WE HAD A LYNCH LIVING IN THE TOWN AND THE MORE I REFLECTED
UPON HIS IMPENDING DOOM THE MORE I COULD NOT SLEEP
IT SEEMED MY PLAIN
DUTY TO SAVE HIM AND A STILL PLAINER AND MORE IMPORTANT DUTY TO GET
SOME SLEEP FOR MYSELF SO AT LAST I VENTURED TO GO TO MR
LYNCH AND TELL
HIM WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO HIM UNDER STRICT SECRECY
I ADVISED HIM
TO 'FLY AND CERTAINLY EXPECTED HIM TO DO IT
BUT HE LAUGHED AT ME AND
HE DID NOT STOP THERE HE LED ME DOWN TO THE CARPENTER'S SHOP GAVE THE
CARPENTER A JEERING AND SCORNFUL LECTURE UPON HIS SILLY PRETENSIONS
SLAPPED HIS FACE MADE HIM GET DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND BEG THEN WENT OFF
AND LEFT ME TO CONTEMPLATE THE CHEAP AND PITIFUL RUIN OF WHAT IN MY
EYES HAD SO LATELY BEEN A MAJESTIC AND INCOMPARABLE HERO
THE CARPENTER BLUSTERED FLOURISHED HIS KNIFE AND DOOMED THIS LYNCH IN
HIS USUAL VOLCANIC STYLE THE SIZE OF HIS FATEFUL WORDS UNDIMINISHED
BUT IT WAS ALL WASTED UPON ME HE WAS A HERO TO ME NO LONGER BUT ONLY
A POOR FOOLISH EXPOSED HUMBUG
I WAS ASHAMED OF HIM AND ASHAMED OF
MYSELF I TOOK NO FURTHER INTEREST IN HIM AND NEVER WENT TO HIS SHOP
ANY MORE
HE WAS A HEAVY LOSS TO ME FOR HE WAS THE GREATEST HERO I
HAD EVER KNOWN
THE FELLOW MUST HAVE HAD SOME TALENT FOR SOME OF HIS
IMAGINARY MURDERS WERE SO VIVIDLY AND DRAMATICALLY DESCRIBED THAT I
REMEMBER ALL THEIR DETAILS YET
THE PEOPLE OF HANNIBAL ARE NOT MORE CHANGED THAN IS THE TOWN
IT IS
NO LONGER A VILLAGE IT IS A CITY WITH A MAYOR AND A COUNCIL AND
WATER WORKS AND PROBABLY A DEBT
IT HAS FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IS A
THRIVING AND ENERGETIC PLACE AND IS PAVED LIKE THE REST OF THE WEST
AND SOUTH WHERE A WELL PAVED STREET AND A GOOD SIDEWALK ARE THINGS SO
SELDOM SEEN THAT ONE DOUBTS THEM WHEN HE DOES SEE THEM
THE CUSTOMARY
HALF DOZEN RAILWAYS CENTER IN HANNIBAL NOW AND THERE IS A NEW DEPOT
WHICH COST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
IN MY TIME THE TOWN HAD NO
SPECIALTY AND NO COMMERCIAL GRANDEUR THE DAILY PACKET USUALLY LANDED
A PASSENGER AND BOUGHT A CATFISH AND TOOK AWAY ANOTHER PASSENGER AND A
HATFUL OF FREIGHT BUT NOW A HUGE COMMERCE IN LUMBER HAS GROWN UP AND
A LARGE MISCELLANEOUS COMMERCE IS ONE OF THE RESULTS
A DEAL OF MONEY
CHANGES HANDS THERE NOW
BEAR CREEK SO CALLED PERHAPS BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY
BARE OF BEARS IS HIDDEN OUT OF SIGHT NOW UNDER ISLANDS AND CONTINENTS
OF PILED LUMBER AND NOBODY BUT AN EXPERT CAN FIND IT
I USED TO GET
DROWNED IN IT EVERY SUMMER REGULARLY AND BE DRAINED OUT AND INFLATED
AND SET GOING AGAIN BY SOME CHANCE ENEMY BUT NOT ENOUGH OF IT IS
UNOCCUPIED NOW TO DROWN A PERSON IN
IT WAS A FAMOUS BREEDER OF CHILLS
AND FEVER IN ITS DAY
I REMEMBER ONE SUMMER WHEN EVERYBODY IN TOWN HAD
THIS DISEASE AT ONCE
MANY CHIMNEYS WERE SHAKEN DOWN AND ALL THE HOUSES
WERE SO RACKED THAT THE TOWN HAD TO BE REBUILT
THE CHASM OR GORGE
BETWEEN LOVER'S LEAP AND THE HILL WEST OF IT IS SUPPOSED BY SCIENTISTS
TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY GLACIAL ACTION
THIS IS A MISTAKE
THERE IS AN INTERESTING CAVE A MILE OR TWO BELOW HANNIBAL AMONG THE
BLUFFS
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO REVISIT IT BUT HAD NOT TIME
IN MY
TIME THE PERSON WHO THEN OWNED IT TURNED IT INTO A MAUSOLEUM FOR HIS
DAUGHTER AGED FOURTEEN
THE BODY OF THIS POOR CHILD WAS PUT INTO A
COPPER CYLINDER FILLED WITH ALCOHOL AND THIS WAS SUSPENDED IN ONE OF
THE DISMAL AVENUES OF THE CAVE
THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER WAS REMOVABLE
AND IT WAS SAID TO BE A COMMON THING FOR THE BASER ORDER OF TOURISTS TO
DRAG THE DEAD FACE INTO VIEW AND EXAMINE IT AND COMMENT UPON IT
CHAPTER 56
A QUESTION OF LAW
THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE IS GONE FROM THE MOUTH OF BEAR CREEK AND SO IS THE
SMALL JAIL OR 'CALABOOSE' WHICH ONCE STOOD IN ITS NEIGHBORHOOD
A
CITIZEN ASKED 'DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN JIMMY FINN THE TOWN DRUNKARD WAS
BURNED TO DEATH IN THE CALABOOSE
OBSERVE NOW HOW HISTORY BECOMES DEFILED THROUGH LAPSE OF TIME AND
THE HELP OF THE BAD MEMORIES OF MEN
JIMMY FINN WAS NOT BURNED IN THE
CALABOOSE BUT DIED A NATURAL DEATH IN A TAN VAT OF A COMBINATION OF
DELIRIUM TREMENS AND SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION
WHEN I SAY NATURAL DEATH I
MEAN IT WAS A NATURAL DEATH FOR JIMMY FINN TO DIE
THE CALABOOSE VICTIM
WAS NOT A CITIZEN HE WAS A POOR STRANGER A HARMLESS WHISKEY SODDEN
TRAMP
I KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS CASE THAN ANYBODY ELSE I KNEW TOO MUCH
OF IT IN THAT BYGONE DAY TO RELISH SPEAKING OF IT
THAT TRAMP WAS
WANDERING ABOUT THE STREETS ONE CHILLY EVENING WITH A PIPE IN HIS
MOUTH AND BEGGING FOR A MATCH HE GOT NEITHER MATCHES NOR COURTESY ON
THE CONTRARY A TROOP OF BAD LITTLE BOYS FOLLOWED HIM AROUND AND AMUSED
THEMSELVES WITH NAGGING AND ANNOYING HIM
I ASSISTED BUT AT LAST SOME
APPEAL WHICH THE WAYFARER MADE FOR FORBEARANCE ACCOMPANYING IT WITH A
PATHETIC REFERENCE TO HIS FORLORN AND FRIENDLESS CONDITION TOUCHED SUCH
SENSE OF SHAME AND REMNANT OF RIGHT FEELING AS WERE LEFT IN ME AND I
WENT AWAY AND GOT HIM SOME MATCHES AND THEN HIED ME HOME AND TO BED
HEAVILY WEIGHTED AS TO CONSCIENCE AND UNBUOYANT IN SPIRIT
AN HOUR OR
TWO AFTERWARD THE MAN WAS ARRESTED AND LOCKED UP IN THE CALABOOSE BY
THE MARSHAL LARGE NAME FOR A CONSTABLE BUT THAT WAS HIS TITLE
AT TWO
IN THE MORNING THE CHURCH BELLS RANG FOR FIRE AND EVERYBODY TURNED
OUT OF COURSE I WITH THE REST
THE TRAMP HAD USED HIS MATCHES
DISASTROUSLY HE HAD SET HIS STRAW BED ON FIRE AND THE OAKEN SHEATHING
OF THE ROOM HAD CAUGHT
WHEN I REACHED THE GROUND TWO HUNDRED MEN
WOMEN AND CHILDREN STOOD MASSED TOGETHER TRANSFIXED WITH HORROR AND
STARING AT THE GRATED WINDOWS OF THE JAIL
BEHIND THE IRON BARS AND
TUGGING FRANTICALLY AT THEM AND SCREAMING FOR HELP STOOD THE TRAMP HE
SEEMED LIKE A BLACK OBJECT SET AGAINST A SUN SO WHITE AND INTENSE WAS
THE LIGHT AT HIS BACK
THAT MARSHAL COULD NOT BE FOUND AND HE HAD THE
ONLY KEY
A BATTERING RAM WAS QUICKLY IMPROVISED AND THE THUNDER OF ITS
BLOWS UPON THE DOOR HAD SO ENCOURAGING A SOUND THAT THE SPECTATORS BROKE
INTO WILD CHEERING AND BELIEVED THE MERCIFUL BATTLE WON
BUT IT WAS NOT
SO
THE TIMBERS WERE TOO STRONG THEY DID NOT YIELD
IT WAS SAID THAT
THE MAN'S DEATH GRIP STILL HELD FAST TO THE BARS AFTER HE WAS DEAD AND
THAT IN THIS POSITION THE FIRES WRAPPED HIM ABOUT AND CONSUMED HIM
AS
TO THIS I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT WAS SEEN AFTER I RECOGNIZED THE FACE THAT
WAS PLEADING THROUGH THE BARS WAS SEEN BY OTHERS NOT BY ME
I SAW THAT FACE SO SITUATED EVERY NIGHT FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD AND
I BELIEVED MYSELF AS GUILTY OF THE MAN'S DEATH AS IF I HAD GIVEN HIM THE
MATCHES PURPOSELY THAT HE MIGHT BURN HIMSELF UP WITH THEM
I HAD NOT A
DOUBT THAT I SHOULD BE HANGED IF MY CONNECTION WITH THIS TRAGEDY WERE
FOUND OUT
THE HAPPENINGS AND THE IMPRESSIONS OF THAT TIME ARE BURNT
INTO MY MEMORY AND THE STUDY OF THEM ENTERTAINS ME AS MUCH NOW AS THEY
THEMSELVES DISTRESSED ME THEN
IF ANYBODY SPOKE OF THAT GRISLY MATTER
I WAS ALL EARS IN A MOMENT AND ALERT TO HEAR WHAT MIGHT BE SAID FOR I
WAS ALWAYS DREADING AND EXPECTING TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS SUSPECTED AND
SO FINE AND SO DELICATE WAS THE PERCEPTION OF MY GUILTY CONSCIENCE
THAT IT OFTEN DETECTED SUSPICION IN THE MOST PURPOSELESS REMARKS AND IN
LOOKS GESTURES GLANCES OF THE EYE WHICH HAD NO SIGNIFICANCE BUT WHICH
SENT ME SHIVERING AWAY IN A PANIC OF FRIGHT JUST THE SAME
AND HOW SICK
IT MADE ME WHEN SOMEBODY DROPPED HOWSOEVER CARELESSLY AND BARREN OF
INTENT THE REMARK THAT 'MURDER WILL OUT FOR A BOY OF TEN YEARS I WAS
CARRYING A PRETTY WEIGHTY CARGO
ALL THIS TIME I WAS BLESSEDLY FORGETTING ONE THING THE FACT THAT I WAS
AN INVETERATE TALKER IN MY SLEEP
BUT ONE NIGHT I AWOKE AND FOUND MY
BED MATE MY YOUNGER BROTHER SITTING UP IN BED AND CONTEMPLATING ME BY
THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
I SAID
'WHAT IS THE MATTER
'YOU TALK SO MUCH I CAN'T SLEEP
I CAME TO A SITTING POSTURE IN AN INSTANT WITH MY KIDNEYS IN MY THROAT
AND MY HAIR ON END
'WHAT DID I SAY
QUICK OUT WITH IT WHAT DID I SAY
'NOTHING MUCH
'IT'S A LIE YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
'EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT
'YOU KNOW WELL ENOUGH
ABOUT THAT
'ABOUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
I THINK YOU ARE
SICK OR CRAZY OR SOMETHING
BUT ANYWAY YOU'RE AWAKE AND I'LL GET TO
SLEEP WHILE I'VE GOT A CHANCE
HE FELL ASLEEP AND I LAY THERE IN A COLD SWEAT TURNING THIS NEW TERROR
OVER IN THE WHIRLING CHAOS WHICH DID DUTY AS MY MIND
THE BURDEN OF
MY THOUGHT WAS HOW MUCH DID I DIVULGE HOW MUCH DOES HE KNOW WHAT A
DISTRESS IS THIS UNCERTAINTY BUT BY AND BY I EVOLVED AN IDEA I WOULD
WAKE MY BROTHER AND PROBE HIM WITH A SUPPOSITITIOUS CASE
I SHOOK HIM
UP AND SAID
'SUPPOSE A MAN SHOULD COME TO YOU DRUNK
'THIS IS FOOLISH I NEVER GET DRUNK
'I DON'T MEAN YOU IDIOT I MEAN THE MAN
SUPPOSE A MAN SHOULD COME
TO YOU DRUNK AND BORROW A KNIFE OR A TOMAHAWK OR A PISTOL AND YOU
FORGOT TO TELL HIM IT WAS LOADED AND
'HOW COULD YOU LOAD A TOMAHAWK
'I DON'T MEAN THE TOMAHAWK AND I DIDN'T SAY THE TOMAHAWK I SAID
THE PISTOL
NOW DON'T YOU KEEP BREAKING IN THAT WAY BECAUSE THIS IS
SERIOUS
THERE'S BEEN A MAN KILLED
'WHAT IN THIS TOWN
'YES IN THIS TOWN
'WELL GO ON I WON'T SAY A SINGLE WORD
'WELL THEN SUPPOSE YOU FORGOT TO TELL HIM TO BE CAREFUL WITH IT
BECAUSE IT WAS LOADED AND HE WENT OFF AND SHOT HIMSELF WITH THAT
PISTOL FOOLING WITH IT YOU KNOW AND PROBABLY DOING IT BY ACCIDENT
BEING DRUNK
WELL WOULD IT BE MURDER
'NO SUICIDE
'NO NO
I DON'T MEAN HIS ACT I MEAN YOURS WOULD YOU BE A MURDERER
FOR LETTING HIM HAVE THAT PISTOL
AFTER DEEP THOUGHT CAME THIS ANSWER
'WELL I SHOULD THINK I WAS GUILTY OF SOMETHING MAYBE MURDER YES
PROBABLY MURDER BUT I DON'T QUITE KNOW
THIS MADE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
HOWEVER IT WAS NOT A DECISIVE VERDICT
I SHOULD HAVE TO SET OUT THE REAL CASE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO OTHER
WAY
BUT I WOULD DO IT CAUTIOUSLY AND KEEP A WATCH OUT FOR SUSPICIOUS
EFFECTS
I SAID
'I WAS SUPPOSING A CASE BUT I AM COMING TO THE REAL ONE NOW
DO YOU
KNOW HOW THE MAN CAME TO BE BURNED UP IN THE CALABOOSE
'NO
'HAVEN'T YOU THE LEAST IDEA
'NOT THE LEAST
'WISH YOU MAY DIE IN YOUR TRACKS IF YOU HAVE
'YES WISH I MAY DIE IN MY TRACKS
'WELL THE WAY OF IT WAS THIS
THE MAN WANTED SOME MATCHES TO LIGHT HIS
PIPE
A BOY GOT HIM SOME
THE MAN SET FIRE TO THE CALABOOSE WITH THOSE
VERY MATCHES AND BURNT HIMSELF UP
'IS THAT SO
'YES IT IS
NOW IS THAT BOY A MURDERER DO YOU THINK
'LET ME SEE
THE MAN WAS DRUNK
'YES HE WAS DRUNK
'VERY DRUNK
'YES
'AND THE BOY KNEW IT
'YES HE KNEW IT
THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE
THEN CAME THIS HEAVY VERDICT
'IF THE MAN WAS DRUNK AND THE BOY KNEW IT THE BOY MURDERED THAT MAN
THIS IS CERTAIN
FAINT SICKENING SENSATIONS CREPT ALONG ALL THE FIBERS OF MY BODY AND
I SEEMED TO KNOW HOW A PERSON FEELS WHO HEARS HIS DEATH SENTENCE
PRONOUNCED FROM THE BENCH
I WAITED TO HEAR WHAT MY BROTHER WOULD SAY
NEXT
I BELIEVED I KNEW WHAT IT WOULD BE AND I WAS RIGHT
HE SAID
'I KNOW THE BOY
I HAD NOTHING TO SAY SO I SAID NOTHING
I SIMPLY SHUDDERED
THEN HE
ADDED
'YES BEFORE YOU GOT HALF THROUGH TELLING ABOUT THE THING I KNEW
PERFECTLY WELL WHO THE BOY WAS IT WAS BEN COONTZ
I CAME OUT OF MY COLLAPSE AS ONE WHO RISES FROM THE DEAD
I SAID WITH
ADMIRATION
'WHY HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU EVER GUESS IT
'YOU TOLD IT IN YOUR SLEEP
I SAID TO MYSELF 'HOW SPLENDID THAT IS THIS IS A HABIT WHICH MUST BE
CULTIVATED
MY BROTHER RATTLED INNOCENTLY ON
'WHEN YOU WERE TALKING IN YOUR SLEEP YOU KEPT MUMBLING SOMETHING ABOUT
MATCHES WHICH I COULDN'T MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF BUT JUST NOW WHEN
YOU BEGAN TO TELL ME ABOUT THE MAN AND THE CALABOOSE AND THE MATCHES
I REMEMBERED THAT IN YOUR SLEEP YOU MENTIONED BEN COONTZ TWO OR THREE
TIMES SO I PUT THIS AND THAT TOGETHER YOU SEE AND RIGHT AWAY I KNEW
IT WAS BEN THAT BURNT THAT MAN UP
I PRAISED HIS SAGACITY EFFUSIVELY
PRESENTLY HE ASKED
'ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE HIM UP TO THE LAW
'NO I SAID 'I BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A LESSON TO HIM
I SHALL KEEP
AN EYE ON HIM OF COURSE FOR THAT IS BUT RIGHT BUT IF HE STOPS WHERE
HE IS AND REFORMS IT SHALL NEVER BE SAID THAT I BETRAYED HIM
'HOW GOOD YOU ARE
'WELL I TRY TO BE
IT IS ALL A PERSON CAN DO IN A WORLD LIKE THIS
AND NOW MY BURDEN BEING SHIFTED TO OTHER SHOULDERS MY TERRORS SOON
FADED AWAY
THE DAY BEFORE WE LEFT HANNIBAL A CURIOUS THING FELL UNDER MY
NOTICE THE SURPRISING SPREAD WHICH LONGITUDINAL TIME UNDERGOES THERE
I LEARNED IT FROM ONE OF THE MOST UNOSTENTATIOUS OF MEN THE COLORED
COACHMAN OF A FRIEND OF MINE WHO LIVES THREE MILES FROM TOWN
HE WAS
TO CALL FOR ME AT THE PARK HOTEL AT 7 30 P M AND DRIVE ME OUT
BUT HE
MISSED IT CONSIDERABLY DID NOT ARRIVE TILL TEN
HE EXCUSED HIMSELF BY
SAYING
'DE TIME IS MOS' AN HOUR EN A HALF SLOWER IN DE COUNTRY EN WHAT IT IS IN
DE TOWN YOU'LL BE IN PLENTY TIME BOSS
SOMETIMES WE SHOVES OUT EARLY
FOR CHURCH SUNDAY EN FETCHES UP DAH RIGHT PLUM IN DE MIDDLE ER DE
SERMON
DIFFUNCE IN DE TIME
A BODY CAN'T MAKE NO CALCULATIONS 'BOUT
IT
I HAD LOST TWO HOURS AND A HALF BUT I HAD LEARNED A FACT WORTH FOUR
CHAPTER 57
AN ARCHANGEL
FROM ST
LOUIS NORTHWARD THERE ARE ALL THE ENLIVENING SIGNS OF THE
PRESENCE OF ACTIVE ENERGETIC INTELLIGENT PROSPEROUS PRACTICAL
NINETEENTH CENTURY POPULATIONS
THE PEOPLE DON'T DREAM THEY WORK
THE
HAPPY RESULT IS MANIFEST ALL AROUND IN THE SUBSTANTIAL OUTSIDE ASPECT
OF THINGS AND THE SUGGESTIONS OF WHOLESOME LIFE AND COMFORT THAT
EVERYWHERE APPEAR
QUINCY IS A NOTABLE EXAMPLE A BRISK HANDSOME WELL ORDERED CITY AND
NOW AS FORMERLY INTERESTED IN ART LETTERS AND OTHER HIGH THINGS
BUT MARION CITY IS AN EXCEPTION
MARION CITY HAS GONE BACKWARDS IN
A MOST UNACCOUNTABLE WAY
THIS METROPOLIS PROMISED SO WELL THAT THE
PROJECTORS TACKED 'CITY' TO ITS NAME IN THE VERY BEGINNING WITH FULL
CONFIDENCE BUT IT WAS BAD PROPHECY
WHEN I FIRST SAW MARION CITY
THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT CONTAINED ONE STREET AND NEARLY OR QUITE SIX
HOUSES
IT CONTAINS BUT ONE HOUSE NOW AND THIS ONE IN A STATE OF RUIN
IS GETTING READY TO FOLLOW THE FORMER FIVE INTO THE RIVER
DOUBTLESS
MARION CITY WAS TOO NEAR TO QUINCY
IT HAD ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE IT WAS
SITUATED IN A FLAT MUD BOTTOM BELOW HIGH WATER MARK WHEREAS QUINCY
STANDS HIGH UP ON THE SLOPE OF A HILL
IN THE BEGINNING QUINCY HAD THE ASPECT AND WAYS OF A MODEL NEW ENGLAND
TOWN AND THESE SHE HAS YET BROAD CLEAN STREETS TRIM NEAT DWELLINGS
AND LAWNS FINE MANSIONS STATELY BLOCKS OF COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS
AND
THERE ARE AMPLE FAIR GROUNDS A WELL KEPT PARK AND MANY ATTRACTIVE
DRIVES LIBRARY READING ROOMS A COUPLE OF COLLEGES SOME HANDSOME AND
COSTLY CHURCHES AND A GRAND COURT HOUSE WITH GROUNDS WHICH OCCUPY A
SQUARE
THE POPULATION OF THE CITY IS THIRTY THOUSAND
THERE ARE SOME
LARGE FACTORIES HERE AND MANUFACTURING OF MANY SORTS IS DONE ON A
GREAT SCALE
LA GRANGE AND CANTON ARE GROWING TOWNS BUT I MISSED ALEXANDRIA WAS
TOLD IT WAS UNDER WATER BUT WOULD COME UP TO BLOW IN THE SUMMER
KEOKUK WAS EASILY RECOGNIZABLE
I LIVED THERE IN 1857 AN EXTRAORDINARY
YEAR THERE IN REAL ESTATE MATTERS
THE 'BOOM' WAS SOMETHING WONDERFUL
EVERYBODY BOUGHT EVERYBODY SOLD EXCEPT WIDOWS AND PREACHERS THEY
ALWAYS HOLD ON AND WHEN THE TIDE EBBS THEY GET LEFT
ANYTHING IN THE
SEMBLANCE OF A TOWN LOT NO MATTER HOW SITUATED WAS SALABLE AND AT A
FIGURE WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN HIGH IF THE GROUND HAD BEEN SODDED
WITH GREENBACKS
THE TOWN HAS A POPULATION OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND NOW AND IS PROGRESSING
WITH A HEALTHY GROWTH
IT WAS NIGHT AND WE COULD NOT SEE DETAILS FOR
WHICH WE WERE SORRY FOR KEOKUK HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING A BEAUTIFUL
CITY
IT WAS A PLEASANT ONE TO LIVE IN LONG AGO AND DOUBTLESS HAS
ADVANCED NOT RETROGRADED IN THAT RESPECT
A MIGHTY WORK WHICH WAS IN PROGRESS THERE IN MY DAY IS FINISHED NOW
THIS IS THE CANAL OVER THE RAPIDS
IT IS EIGHT MILES LONG THREE HUNDRED
FEET WIDE AND IS IN NO PLACE LESS THAN SIX FEET DEEP
ITS MASONRY IS
OF THE MAJESTIC KIND WHICH THE WAR DEPARTMENT USUALLY DEALS IN AND WILL
ENDURE LIKE A ROMAN AQUEDUCT
THE WORK COST FOUR OR FIVE MILLIONS
AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO SPENT WITH FORMER FRIENDS WE STARTED UP THE RIVER
AGAIN
KEOKUK A LONG TIME AGO WAS AN OCCASIONAL LOAFING PLACE OF THAT
ERRATIC GENIUS HENRY CLAY DEAN
I BELIEVE I NEVER SAW HIM BUT ONCE BUT
HE WAS MUCH TALKED OF WHEN I LIVED THERE
THIS IS WHAT WAS SAID OF HIM
HE BEGAN LIFE POOR AND WITHOUT EDUCATION
BUT HE EDUCATED HIMSELF ON
THE CURBSTONES OF KEOKUK
HE WOULD SIT DOWN ON A CURBSTONE WITH HIS
BOOK CARELESS OR UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CLATTER OF COMMERCE AND THE TRAMP
OF THE PASSING CROWDS AND BURY HIMSELF IN HIS STUDIES BY THE HOUR
NEVER CHANGING HIS POSITION EXCEPT TO DRAW IN HIS KNEES NOW AND THEN
TO LET A DRAY PASS UNOBSTRUCTED AND WHEN HIS BOOK WAS FINISHED ITS
CONTENTS HOWEVER ABSTRUSE HAD BEEN BURNT INTO HIS MEMORY AND WERE HIS
PERMANENT POSSESSION
IN THIS WAY HE ACQUIRED A VAST HOARD OF ALL SORTS
OF LEARNING AND HAD IT PIGEON HOLED IN HIS HEAD WHERE HE COULD PUT HIS
INTELLECTUAL HAND ON IT WHENEVER IT WAS WANTED
HIS CLOTHES DIFFERED IN NO RESPECT FROM A 'WHARF RAT'S EXCEPT THAT
THEY WERE RAGGEDER MORE ILL ASSORTED AND INHARMONIOUS AND THEREFORE
MORE EXTRAVAGANTLY PICTURESQUE AND SEVERAL LAYERS DIRTIER
NOBODY
COULD INFER THE MASTER MIND IN THE TOP OF THAT EDIFICE FROM THE EDIFICE
ITSELF
HE WAS AN ORATOR BY NATURE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND LATER BY THE
TRAINING OF EXPERIENCE AND PRACTICE
WHEN HE WAS OUT ON A CANVASS HIS
NAME WAS A LODESTONE WHICH DREW THE FARMERS TO HIS STUMP FROM FIFTY
MILES AROUND
HIS THEME WAS ALWAYS POLITICS
HE USED NO NOTES FOR
A VOLCANO DOES NOT NEED NOTES
IN 1862 A SON OF KEOKUK'S LATE
DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN MR
CLAGGETT GAVE ME THIS INCIDENT CONCERNING
DEAN
THE WAR FEELING WAS RUNNING HIGH IN KEOKUK IN '61 AND A GREAT
MASS MEETING WAS TO BE HELD ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE NEW ATHENAEUM
A
DISTINGUISHED STRANGER WAS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE
AFTER THE BUILDING HAD
BEEN PACKED TO ITS UTMOST CAPACITY WITH SWELTERING FOLK OF BOTH SEXES
THE STAGE STILL REMAINED VACANT THE DISTINGUISHED STRANGER HAD FAILED
TO CONNECT
THE CROWD GREW IMPATIENT AND BY AND BY INDIGNANT AND
REBELLIOUS
ABOUT THIS TIME A DISTRESSED MANAGER DISCOVERED DEAN ON A
CURB STONE EXPLAINED THE DILEMMA TO HIM TOOK HIS BOOK AWAY FROM HIM
RUSHED HIM INTO THE BUILDING THE BACK WAY AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE FOR THE
STAGE AND SAVE HIS COUNTRY
PRESENTLY A SUDDEN SILENCE FELL UPON THE GRUMBLING AUDIENCE AND
EVERYBODY'S EYES SOUGHT A SINGLE POINT THE WIDE EMPTY CARPETLESS
STAGE
A FIGURE APPEARED THERE WHOSE ASPECT WAS FAMILIAR TO HARDLY A
DOZEN PERSONS PRESENT
IT WAS THE SCARECROW DEAN IN FOXY SHOES DOWN AT
THE HEELS SOCKS OF ODD COLORS ALSO 'DOWN DAMAGED TROUSERS RELICS OF
ANTIQUITY AND A WORLD TOO SHORT EXPOSING SOME INCHES OF NAKED ANKLE
AN UNBUTTONED VEST ALSO TOO SHORT AND EXPOSING A ZONE OF SOILED AND
WRINKLED LINEN BETWEEN IT AND THE WAISTBAND SHIRT BOSOM OPEN LONG
BLACK HANDKERCHIEF WOUND ROUND AND ROUND THE NECK LIKE A BANDAGE
BOB TAILED BLUE COAT REACHING DOWN TO THE SMALL OF THE BACK
WITH SLEEVES WHICH LEFT FOUR INCHES OF FOREARM UNPROTECTED SMALL
STIFF BRIMMED SOLDIER CAP HUNG ON A CORNER OF THE BUMP OF WHICHEVER
BUMP IT WAS
THIS FIGURE MOVED GRAVELY OUT UPON THE STAGE AND WITH
SEDATE AND MEASURED STEP DOWN TO THE FRONT WHERE IT PAUSED AND
DREAMILY INSPECTED THE HOUSE SAYING NO WORD
THE SILENCE OF SURPRISE
HELD ITS OWN FOR A MOMENT THEN WAS BROKEN BY A JUST AUDIBLE RIPPLE
OF MERRIMENT WHICH SWEPT THE SEA OF FACES LIKE THE WASH OF A WAVE
THE FIGURE REMAINED AS BEFORE THOUGHTFULLY INSPECTING
ANOTHER WAVE
STARTED LAUGHTER THIS TIME
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER THEN A
THIRD THIS LAST ONE BOISTEROUS
AND NOW THE STRANGER STEPPED BACK ONE PACE TOOK OFF HIS SOLDIER CAP
TOSSED IT INTO THE WING AND BEGAN TO SPEAK WITH DELIBERATION NOBODY
LISTENING EVERYBODY LAUGHING AND WHISPERING
THE SPEAKER TALKED ON
UNEMBARRASSED AND PRESENTLY DELIVERED A SHOT WHICH WENT HOME AND
SILENCE AND ATTENTION RESULTED
HE FOLLOWED IT QUICK AND FAST WITH
OTHER TELLING THINGS WARMED TO HIS WORK AND BEGAN TO POUR HIS WORDS
OUT INSTEAD OF DRIPPING THEM GREW HOTTER AND HOTTER AND FELL TO
DISCHARGING LIGHTNINGS AND THUNDER AND NOW THE HOUSE BEGAN TO BREAK
INTO APPLAUSE TO WHICH THE SPEAKER GAVE NO HEED BUT WENT HAMMERING
STRAIGHT ON UNWOUND HIS BLACK BANDAGE AND CAST IT AWAY STILL
THUNDERING PRESENTLY DISCARDED THE BOB TAILED COAT AND FLUNG IT ASIDE
FIRING UP HIGHER AND HIGHER ALL THE TIME FINALLY FLUNG THE VEST AFTER
THE COAT AND THEN FOR AN UNTIMED PERIOD STOOD THERE LIKE ANOTHER
VESUVIUS SPOUTING SMOKE AND FLAME LAVA AND ASHES RAINING PUMICE STONE
AND CINDERS SHAKING THE MORAL EARTH WITH INTELLECTUAL CRASH UPON CRASH
EXPLOSION UPON EXPLOSION WHILE THE MAD MULTITUDE STOOD UPON THEIR FEET
IN A SOLID BODY ANSWERING BACK WITH A CEASELESS HURRICANE OF CHEERS
THROUGH A THRASHING SNOWSTORM OF WAVING HANDKERCHIEFS
'WHEN DEAN CAME SAID CLAGGETT 'THE PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS AN ESCAPED
LUNATIC BUT WHEN HE WENT THEY THOUGHT HE WAS AN ESCAPED ARCHANGEL
BURLINGTON HOME OF THE SPARKLING BURDETTE IS ANOTHER HILL CITY AND
ALSO A BEAUTIFUL ONE UNQUESTIONABLY SO A FINE AND FLOURISHING
CITY WITH A POPULATION OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND BELTED WITH BUSY
FACTORIES OF NEARLY EVERY IMAGINABLE DESCRIPTION
IT WAS A VERY SOBER
CITY TOO FOR THE MOMENT FOR A MOST SOBERING BILL WAS PENDING A BILL
TO FORBID THE MANUFACTURE EXPORTATION IMPORTATION PURCHASE SALE
BORROWING LENDING STEALING DRINKING SMELLING OR POSSESSION BY
CONQUEST INHERITANCE INTENT ACCIDENT OR OTHERWISE IN THE STATE OF
IOWA OF EACH AND EVERY DELETERIOUS BEVERAGE KNOWN TO THE HUMAN RACE
EXCEPT WATER
THIS MEASURE WAS APPROVED BY ALL THE RATIONAL PEOPLE IN
THE STATE BUT NOT BY THE BENCH OF JUDGES
BURLINGTON HAS THE PROGRESSIVE MODERN CITY'S FULL EQUIPMENT OF DEVICES
FOR RIGHT AND INTELLIGENT GOVERNMENT INCLUDING A PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT
A THING WHICH THE GREAT CITY OF NEW ORLEANS IS WITHOUT BUT STILL
EMPLOYS THAT RELIC OF ANTIQUITY THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM
IN BURLINGTON AS IN ALL THESE UPPER RIVER TOWNS ONE BREATHES A
GO AHEAD ATMOSPHERE WHICH TASTES GOOD IN THE NOSTRILS
AN OPERA HOUSE
HAS LATELY BEEN BUILT THERE WHICH IS IN STRONG CONTRAST WITH THE SHABBY
DENS WHICH USUALLY DO DUTY AS THEATERS IN CITIES OF BURLINGTON'S SIZE
WE HAD NOT TIME TO GO ASHORE IN MUSCATINE BUT HAD A DAYLIGHT VIEW OF IT
FROM THE BOAT
I LIVED THERE AWHILE MANY YEARS AGO BUT THE PLACE NOW
HAD A RATHER UNFAMILIAR LOOK SO I SUPPOSE IT HAS CLEAR OUTGROWN THE
TOWN WHICH I USED TO KNOW
IN FACT I KNOW IT HAS FOR I REMEMBER IT AS
A SMALL PLACE WHICH IT ISN'T NOW
BUT I REMEMBER IT BEST FOR A
LUNATIC WHO CAUGHT ME OUT IN THE FIELDS ONE SUNDAY AND EXTRACTED A
BUTCHER KNIFE FROM HIS BOOT AND PROPOSED TO CARVE ME UP WITH IT
UNLESS I ACKNOWLEDGED HIM TO BE THE ONLY SON OF THE DEVIL
I TRIED
TO COMPROMISE ON AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE
FAMILY I HAD MET BUT THAT DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY
HALF MEASURES I MUST SAY HE WAS THE SOLE AND ONLY SON OF THE DEVIL HE
WHETTED HIS KNIFE ON HIS BOOT
IT DID NOT SEEM WORTH WHILE TO MAKE
TROUBLE ABOUT A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT SO I SWUNG ROUND TO HIS VIEW OF
THE MATTER AND SAVED MY SKIN WHOLE
SHORTLY AFTERWARD HE WENT TO VISIT
HIS FATHER AND AS HE HAS NOT TURNED UP SINCE I TRUST HE IS THERE YET
AND I REMEMBER MUSCATINE STILL MORE PLEASANTLY FOR ITS SUMMER SUNSETS
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN THAT EQUALED THEM
THEY USED THE BROAD SMOOTH RIVER AS A CANVAS AND PAINTED ON IT EVERY
IMAGINABLE DREAM OF COLOR FROM THE MOTTLED DAINTINESSES AND DELICACIES
OF THE OPAL ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH CUMULATIVE INTENSITIES TO BLINDING
PURPLE AND CRIMSON CONFLAGRATIONS WHICH WERE ENCHANTING TO THE EYE BUT
SHARPLY TRIED IT AT THE SAME TIME
ALL THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI REGION
HAS THESE EXTRAORDINARY SUNSETS AS A FAMILIAR SPECTACLE
IT IS THE TRUE
SUNSET LAND I AM SURE NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN SHOW SO GOOD A RIGHT TO THE
NAME
THE SUNRISES ARE ALSO SAID TO BE EXCEEDINGLY FINE
I DO NOT KNOW
CHAPTER 58
ON THE UPPER RIVER
THE BIG TOWNS DROP IN THICK AND FAST NOW AND BETWEEN STRETCH
PROCESSIONS OF THRIFTY FARMS NOT DESOLATE SOLITUDE
HOUR BY HOUR THE
BOAT PLOWS DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE GREAT AND POPULOUS NORTH WEST AND
WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE SECTION OF IT WHICH IS REVEALED ONE'S SURPRISE
AND RESPECT GATHER EMPHASIS AND INCREASE
SUCH A PEOPLE AND SUCH
ACHIEVEMENTS AS THEIRS COMPEL HOMAGE
THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT RACE WHO
THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND WHO ARE COMPETENT TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY ARE
EDUCATED AND ENLIGHTENED THEY READ THEY KEEP ABREAST OF THE BEST
AND NEWEST THOUGHT THEY FORTIFY EVERY WEAK PLACE IN THEIR LAND WITH A
SCHOOL A COLLEGE A LIBRARY AND A NEWSPAPER AND THEY LIVE UNDER LAW
SOLICITUDE FOR THE FUTURE OF A RACE LIKE THIS IS NOT IN ORDER
THIS REGION IS NEW SO NEW THAT IT MAY BE SAID TO BE STILL IN ITS
BABYHOOD
BY WHAT IT HAS ACCOMPLISHED WHILE STILL TEETHING ONE MAY
FORECAST WHAT MARVELS IT WILL DO IN THE STRENGTH OF ITS MATURITY
IT
IS SO NEW THAT THE FOREIGN TOURIST HAS NOT HEARD OF IT YET AND HAS NOT
VISITED IT
FOR SIXTY YEARS THE FOREIGN TOURIST HAS STEAMED UP AND
DOWN THE RIVER BETWEEN ST
LOUIS AND NEW ORLEANS AND THEN GONE HOME AND
WRITTEN HIS BOOK BELIEVING HE HAD SEEN ALL OF THE RIVER THAT WAS WORTH
SEEING OR THAT HAD ANYTHING TO SEE
IN NOT SIX OF ALL THESE BOOKS IS
THERE MENTION OF THESE UPPER RIVER TOWNS FOR THE REASON THAT THE FIVE
OR SIX TOURISTS WHO PENETRATED THIS REGION DID IT BEFORE THESE TOWNS
WERE PROJECTED
THE LATEST TOURIST OF THEM ALL 1878 MADE THE SAME OLD
REGULATION TRIP HE HAD NOT HEARD THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING NORTH OF ST
LOUIS
YET THERE WAS
THERE WAS THIS AMAZING REGION BRISTLING WITH GREAT
TOWNS PROJECTED DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SO TO SPEAK AND BUILT NEXT
MORNING
A SCORE OF THEM NUMBER FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND
PEOPLE
THEN WE HAVE MUSCATINE TEN THOUSAND WINONA TEN THOUSAND
MOLINE TEN THOUSAND ROCK ISLAND TWELVE THOUSAND LA CROSSE TWELVE
THOUSAND BURLINGTON TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DUBUQUE TWENTY FIVE
THOUSAND DAVENPORT THIRTY THOUSAND ST
PAUL FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND
MINNEAPOLIS SIXTY THOUSAND AND UPWARD
THE FOREIGN TOURIST HAS NEVER HEARD OF THESE THERE IS NO NOTE OF THEM
IN HIS BOOKS
THEY HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE NIGHT WHILE HE SLEPT
SO NEW
IS THIS REGION THAT I WHO AM COMPARATIVELY YOUNG AM YET OLDER THAN
IT IS
WHEN I WAS BORN ST
PAUL HAD A POPULATION OF THREE PERSONS
MINNEAPOLIS HAD JUST A THIRD AS MANY
THE THEN POPULATION OF MINNEAPOLIS
DIED TWO YEARS AGO AND WHEN HE DIED HE HAD SEEN HIMSELF UNDERGO AN
INCREASE IN FORTY YEARS OF FIFTY NINE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND
NINETY NINE PERSONS
HE HAD A FROG'S FERTILITY
I MUST EXPLAIN THAT THE FIGURES SET DOWN ABOVE AS THE POPULATION OF ST
PAUL AND MINNEAPOLIS ARE SEVERAL MONTHS OLD
THESE TOWNS ARE FAR LARGER
NOW
IN FACT I HAVE JUST SEEN A NEWSPAPER ESTIMATE WHICH GIVES THE
FORMER SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND AND THE LATTER SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND
THIS
BOOK WILL NOT REACH THE PUBLIC FOR SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS YET NONE OF THE
FIGURES WILL BE WORTH MUCH THEN
WE HAD A GLIMPSE OF DAVENPORT WHICH IS ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL CITY CROWNING
A HILL A PHRASE WHICH APPLIES TO ALL THESE TOWNS FOR THEY ARE ALL
COMELY ALL WELL BUILT CLEAN ORDERLY PLEASANT TO THE EYE AND
CHEERING TO THE SPIRIT AND THEY ARE ALL SITUATED UPON HILLS
THEREFORE
WE WILL GIVE THAT PHRASE A REST
THE INDIANS HAVE A TRADITION THAT
MARQUETTE AND JOLIET CAMPED WHERE DAVENPORT NOW STANDS IN 1673
THE
NEXT WHITE MAN WHO CAMPED THERE DID IT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY
YEARS LATER IN 1834
DAVENPORT HAS GATHERED ITS THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE
WITHIN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS
SHE SENDS MORE CHILDREN TO HER SCHOOLS
NOW THAN HER WHOLE POPULATION NUMBERED TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO
SHE HAS
THE USUAL UPPER RIVER QUOTA OF FACTORIES NEWSPAPERS AND INSTITUTIONS
OF LEARNING SHE HAS TELEPHONES LOCAL TELEGRAPHS AN ELECTRIC ALARM
AND AN ADMIRABLE PAID FIRE DEPARTMENT CONSISTING OF SIX HOOK AND LADDER
COMPANIES FOUR STEAM FIRE ENGINES AND THIRTY CHURCHES
DAVENPORT IS
THE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE OF TWO BISHOPS EPISCOPAL AND CATHOLIC
OPPOSITE DAVENPORT IS THE FLOURISHING TOWN OF ROCK ISLAND WHICH LIES AT
THE FOOT OF THE UPPER RAPIDS
A GREAT RAILROAD BRIDGE CONNECTS THE TWO
TOWNS ONE OF THE THIRTEEN WHICH FRET THE MISSISSIPPI AND THE PILOTS
BETWEEN ST
LOUIS AND ST
PAUL
THE CHARMING ISLAND OF ROCK ISLAND THREE MILES LONG AND HALF A MILE
WIDE BELONGS TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS TURNED IT
INTO A WONDERFUL PARK ENHANCING ITS NATURAL ATTRACTIONS BY ART AND
THREADING ITS FINE FORESTS WITH MANY MILES OF DRIVES
NEAR THE CENTER
OF THE ISLAND ONE CATCHES GLIMPSES THROUGH THE TREES OF TEN VAST STONE
FOUR STORY BUILDINGS EACH OF WHICH COVERS AN ACRE OF GROUND
THESE
ARE THE GOVERNMENT WORKSHOPS FOR THE ROCK ISLAND ESTABLISHMENT IS A
NATIONAL ARMORY AND ARSENAL
WE MOVE UP THE RIVER ALWAYS THROUGH ENCHANTING SCENERY THERE BEING NO
OTHER KIND ON THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI AND PASS MOLINE A CENTER OF VAST
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES AND CLINTON AND LYONS GREAT LUMBER CENTERS
AND PRESENTLY REACH DUBUQUE WHICH IS SITUATED IN A RICH MINERAL REGION
THE LEAD MINES ARE VERY PRODUCTIVE AND OF WIDE EXTENT
DUBUQUE HAS A
GREAT NUMBER OF MANUFACTURING ESTABLISHMENTS AMONG THEM A PLOW FACTORY
WHICH HAS FOR CUSTOMERS ALL CHRISTENDOM IN GENERAL
AT LEAST SO I WAS
TOLD BY AN AGENT OF THE CONCERN WHO WAS ON THE BOAT
HE SAID
'YOU SHOW ME ANY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN WHERE THEY REALLY KNOW HOW TO
PLOW AND IF I DON'T SHOW YOU OUR MARK ON THE PLOW THEY USE I'LL EAT
THAT PLOW AND I WON'T ASK FOR ANY WOOSTERSHYRE SAUCE TO FLAVOR IT UP
WITH EITHER
ALL THIS PART OF THE RIVER IS RICH IN INDIAN HISTORY AND TRADITIONS
BLACK HAWK'S WAS ONCE A PUISSANT NAME HEREABOUTS AS WAS
KEOKUK'S FURTHER DOWN
A FEW MILES BELOW DUBUQUE IS THE TETE DE
MORT DEATH'S HEAD ROCK OR BLUFF TO THE TOP OF WHICH THE FRENCH DROVE
A BAND OF INDIANS IN EARLY TIMES AND COOPED THEM UP THERE WITH DEATH
FOR A CERTAINTY AND ONLY THE MANNER OF IT MATTER OF CHOICE TO STARVE
OR JUMP OFF AND KILL THEMSELVES
BLACK HAWK ADOPTED THE WAYS OF THE
WHITE PEOPLE TOWARD THE END OF HIS LIFE AND WHEN HE DIED HE WAS
BURIED NEAR DES MOINES IN CHRISTIAN FASHION MODIFIED BY INDIAN
CUSTOM THAT IS TO SAY CLOTHED IN A CHRISTIAN MILITARY UNIFORM AND
WITH A CHRISTIAN CANE IN HIS HAND BUT DEPOSITED IN THE GRAVE IN A
SITTING POSTURE
FORMERLY A HORSE HAD ALWAYS BEEN BURIED WITH A CHIEF
THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE CANE SHOWS THAT BLACK HAWK'S HAUGHTY NATURE WAS
REALLY HUMBLED AND HE EXPECTED TO WALK WHEN HE GOT OVER
WE NOTICED THAT ABOVE DUBUQUE THE WATER OF THE MISSISSIPPI WAS
OLIVE GREEN RICH AND BEAUTIFUL AND SEMI TRANSPARENT WITH THE SUN ON
IT
OF COURSE THE WATER WAS NOWHERE AS CLEAR OR OF AS FINE A COMPLEXION
AS IT IS IN SOME OTHER SEASONS OF THE YEAR FOR NOW IT WAS AT FLOOD
STAGE AND THEREFORE DIMMED AND BLURRED BY THE MUD MANUFACTURED FROM
CAVING BANKS
THE MAJESTIC BLUFFS THAT OVERLOOK THE RIVER ALONG THROUGH THIS REGION
CHARM ONE WITH THE GRACE AND VARIETY OF THEIR FORMS AND THE SOFT
BEAUTY OF THEIR ADORNMENT
THE STEEP VERDANT SLOPE WHOSE BASE IS AT
THE WATER'S EDGE IS TOPPED BY A LOFTY RAMPART OF BROKEN TURRETED ROCKS
WHICH ARE EXQUISITELY RICH AND MELLOW IN COLOR MAINLY DARK BROWNS
AND DULL GREENS BUT SPLASHED WITH OTHER TINTS
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE
SHINING RIVER WINDING HERE AND THERE AND YONDER ITS SWEEP INTERRUPTED
AT INTERVALS BY CLUSTERS OF WOODED ISLANDS THREADED BY SILVER CHANNELS
AND YOU HAVE GLIMPSES OF DISTANT VILLAGES ASLEEP UPON CAPES AND OF
STEALTHY RAFTS SLIPPING ALONG IN THE SHADE OF THE FOREST WALLS AND OF
WHITE STEAMERS VANISHING AROUND REMOTE POINTS
AND IT IS ALL AS
TRANQUIL AND REPOSEFUL AS DREAMLAND AND HAS NOTHING THIS WORLDLY ABOUT
IT NOTHING TO HANG A FRET OR A WORRY UPON
UNTIL THE UNHOLY TRAIN COMES TEARING ALONG WHICH IT PRESENTLY DOES
RIPPING THE SACRED SOLITUDE TO RAGS AND TATTERS WITH ITS DEVIL'S
WARWHOOP AND THE ROAR AND THUNDER OF ITS RUSHING WHEELS AND STRAIGHTWAY
YOU ARE BACK IN THIS WORLD AND WITH ONE OF ITS FRETS READY TO HAND FOR
YOUR ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOU REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE VERY ROAD WHOSE
STOCK ALWAYS GOES DOWN AFTER YOU BUY IT AND ALWAYS GOES UP AGAIN AS
SOON AS YOU SELL IT
IT MAKES ME SHUDDER TO THIS DAY TO REMEMBER THAT
I ONCE CAME NEAR NOT GETTING RID OF MY STOCK AT ALL
IT MUST BE AN AWFUL
THING TO HAVE A RAILROAD LEFT ON YOUR HANDS
THE LOCOMOTIVE IS IN SIGHT FROM THE DECK OF THE STEAMBOAT ALMOST
THE WHOLE WAY FROM ST
LOUIS TO ST
PAUL EIGHT HUNDRED MILES
THESE
RAILROADS HAVE MADE HAVOC WITH THE STEAMBOAT COMMERCE
THE CLERK OF OUR
BOAT WAS A STEAMBOAT CLERK BEFORE THESE ROADS WERE BUILT
IN THAT DAY
THE INFLUX OF POPULATION WAS SO GREAT AND THE FREIGHT BUSINESS SO
HEAVY THAT THE BOATS WERE NOT ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMANDS MADE
UPON THEIR CARRYING CAPACITY CONSEQUENTLY THE CAPTAINS WERE VERY
INDEPENDENT AND AIRY PRETTY 'BIGGITY AS UNCLE REMUS WOULD SAY
THE
CLERK NUT SHELLED THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE FORMER TIME AND THE PRESENT
THUS
'BOAT USED TO LAND CAPTAIN ON HURRICANE ROOF MIGHTY STIFF AND
STRAIGHT IRON RAMROD FOR A SPINE KID GLOVES PLUG TILE HAIR PARTED
BEHIND MAN ON SHORE TAKES OFF HAT AND SAYS
GOT TWENTY EIGHT TONS OF WHEAT CAP'N BE GREAT FAVOR IF YOU CAN TAKE
THEM
'CAPTAIN SAYS
'LL TAKE TWO OF THEM AND DON'T EVEN CONDESCEND TO LOOK AT HIM
'BUT NOWADAYS THE CAPTAIN TAKES OFF HIS OLD SLOUCH AND SMILES ALL THE
WAY AROUND TO THE BACK OF HIS EARS AND GETS OFF A BOW WHICH HE HASN'T
GOT ANY RAMROD TO INTERFERE WITH AND SAYS
GLAD TO SEE YOU SMITH GLAD TO SEE YOU YOU'RE LOOKING WELL HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU LOOKING SO WELL FOR YEARS WHAT YOU GOT FOR US
NUTH'N SAYS SMITH AND KEEPS HIS HAT ON AND JUST TURNS HIS BACK AND
GOES TO TALKING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE
'OH YES EIGHT YEARS AGO THE CAPTAIN WAS ON TOP BUT IT'S SMITH'S TURN
NOW
EIGHT YEARS AGO A BOAT USED TO GO UP THE RIVER WITH EVERY STATEROOM
FULL AND PEOPLE PILED FIVE AND SIX DEEP ON THE CABIN FLOOR AND A SOLID
DECK LOAD OF IMMIGRANTS AND HARVESTERS DOWN BELOW INTO THE BARGAIN
TO
GET A FIRST CLASS STATEROOM YOU'D GOT TO PROVE SIXTEEN QUARTERINGS OF
NOBILITY AND FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF DESCENT OR BE PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED
WITH THE NIGGER THAT BLACKED THE CAPTAIN'S BOOTS
BUT IT'S ALL CHANGED
NOW PLENTY STATEROOMS ABOVE NO HARVESTERS BELOW THERE'S A PATENT
SELF BINDER NOW AND THEY DON'T HAVE HARVESTERS ANY MORE THEY'VE GONE
WHERE THE WOODBINE TWINETH AND THEY DIDN'T GO BY STEAMBOAT EITHER
WENT BY THE TRAIN
UP IN THIS REGION WE MET MASSED ACRES OF LUMBER RAFTS COMING DOWN BUT
NOT FLOATING LEISURELY ALONG IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY MANNED WITH
JOYOUS AND RECKLESS CREWS OF FIDDLING SONG SINGING WHISKEY DRINKING
BREAKDOWN DANCING RAPSCALLIONS NO THE WHOLE THING WAS SHOVED SWIFTLY
ALONG BY A POWERFUL STERN WHEELER MODERN FASHION AND THE SMALL
CREWS WERE QUIET ORDERLY MEN OF A SEDATE BUSINESS ASPECT WITH NOT A
SUGGESTION OF ROMANCE ABOUT THEM ANYWHERE
ALONG HERE SOMEWHERE ON A BLACK NIGHT WE RAN SOME EXCEEDINGLY NARROW
AND INTRICATE ISLAND CHUTES BY AID OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
BEHIND WAS
SOLID BLACKNESS A CRACKLESS BANK OF IT AHEAD A NARROW ELBOW OF WATER
CURVING BETWEEN DENSE WALLS OF FOLIAGE THAT ALMOST TOUCHED OUR BOWS ON
BOTH SIDES AND HERE EVERY INDIVIDUAL LEAF AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL RIPPLE
STOOD OUT IN ITS NATURAL COLOR AND FLOODED WITH A GLARE AS OF NOONDAY
INTENSIFIED
THE EFFECT WAS STRANGE AND FINE AND VERY STRIKING
WE PASSED PRAIRIE DU CHIEN ANOTHER OF FATHER MARQUETTE'S
CAMPING PLACES AND AFTER SOME HOURS OF PROGRESS THROUGH VARIED AND
BEAUTIFUL SCENERY REACHED LA CROSSE
HERE IS A TOWN OF TWELVE OR
THIRTEEN THOUSAND POPULATION WITH ELECTRIC LIGHTED STREETS AND WITH
BLOCKS OF BUILDINGS WHICH ARE STATELY ENOUGH AND ALSO ARCHITECTURALLY
FINE ENOUGH TO COMMAND RESPECT IN ANY CITY
IT IS A CHOICE TOWN AND WE
MADE SATISFACTORY USE OF THE HOUR ALLOWED US IN ROAMING IT OVER THOUGH
THE WEATHER WAS RAINIER THAN NECESSARY
CHAPTER 59
LEGENDS AND SCENERY
WE ADDED SEVERAL PASSENGERS TO OUR LIST AT LA CROSSE AMONG OTHERS AN
OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD COME TO THIS NORTH WESTERN REGION WITH THE EARLY
SETTLERS AND WAS FAMILIAR WITH EVERY PART OF IT
PARDONABLY PROUD OF
IT TOO
HE SAID
'YOU'LL FIND SCENERY BETWEEN HERE AND ST
PAUL THAT CAN GIVE THE HUDSON
POINTS
YOU'LL HAVE THE QUEEN'S BLUFF SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND
JUST AS IMPOSING A SPECTACLE AS YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERES AND TREMPELEAU
ISLAND WHICH ISN'T LIKE ANY OTHER ISLAND IN AMERICA I BELIEVE FOR IT
IS A GIGANTIC MOUNTAIN WITH PRECIPITOUS SIDES AND IS FULL OF INDIAN
TRADITIONS AND USED TO BE FULL OF RATTLESNAKES IF YOU CATCH THE SUN
JUST RIGHT THERE YOU WILL HAVE A PICTURE THAT WILL STAY WITH YOU
AND
ABOVE WINONA YOU'LL HAVE LOVELY PRAIRIES AND THEN COME THE THOUSAND
ISLANDS TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR ANYTHING GREEN WHY YOU NEVER SAW FOLIAGE SO
GREEN NOR PACKED SO THICK IT'S LIKE A THOUSAND PLUSH CUSHIONS AFLOAT
ON A LOOKING GLASS WHEN THE WATER 'S STILL AND THEN THE MONSTROUS
BLUFFS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE RIVER RAGGED RUGGED DARK COMPLECTED JUST
THE FRAME THAT'S WANTED YOU ALWAYS WANT A STRONG FRAME YOU KNOW TO
THROW UP THE NICE POINTS OF A DELICATE PICTURE AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT
THE OLD GENTLEMAN ALSO TOLD US A TOUCHING INDIAN LEGEND OR TWO BUT NOT
VERY POWERFUL ONES
AFTER THIS EXCURSION INTO HISTORY HE CAME BACK TO THE SCENERY AND
DESCRIBED IT DETAIL BY DETAIL FROM THE THOUSAND ISLANDS TO ST
PAUL
NAMING ITS NAMES WITH SUCH FACILITY TRIPPING ALONG HIS THEME WITH SUCH
NIMBLE AND CONFIDENT EASE SLAMMING IN A THREE TON WORD HERE AND
THERE WITH SUCH A COMPLACENT AIR OF 'T
ISN'T ANYTHING I CAN DO IT ANY TIME I WANT TO AND LETTING OFF FINE
SURPRISES OF LURID ELOQUENCE AT SUCH JUDICIOUS INTERVALS THAT I
PRESENTLY BEGAN TO SUSPECT
BUT NO MATTER WHAT I BEGAN TO SUSPECT
HEAR HIM
'TEN MILES ABOVE WINONA WE COME TO FOUNTAIN CITY NESTLING SWEETLY AT
THE FEET OF CLIFFS THAT LIFT THEIR AWFUL FRONTS JOVELIKE TOWARD THE
BLUE DEPTHS OF HEAVEN BATHING THEM IN VIRGIN ATMOSPHERES THAT HAVE
KNOWN NO OTHER CONTACT SAVE THAT OF ANGELS' WINGS
'AND NEXT WE GLIDE THROUGH SILVER WATERS AMID LOVELY AND STUPENDOUS
ASPECTS OF NATURE THAT ATTUNE OUR HEARTS TO ADORING ADMIRATION ABOUT
TWELVE MILES AND STRIKE MOUNT VERNON SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH WITH
ROMANTIC RUINS OF A ONCE FIRST CLASS HOTEL PERCHED FAR AMONG THE CLOUD
SHADOWS THAT MOTTLE ITS DIZZY HEIGHTS SOLE REMNANT OF ONCE FLOURISHING
MOUNT VERNON TOWN OF EARLY DAYS NOW DESOLATE AND UTTERLY DESERTED
'AND SO WE MOVE ON
PAST CHIMNEY ROCK WE FLY NOBLE SHAFT OF SIX HUNDRED
FEET THEN JUST BEFORE LANDING AT MINNIESKA OUR ATTENTION IS ATTRACTED
BY A MOST STRIKING PROMONTORY RISING OVER FIVE HUNDRED FEET THE IDEAL
MOUNTAIN PYRAMID
ITS CONIC SHAPE THICKLY WOODED SURFACE GIRDING ITS
SIDES AND ITS APEX LIKE THAT OF A CONE CAUSE THE SPECTATOR TO WONDER
AT NATURE'S WORKINGS
FROM ITS DIZZY HEIGHTS SUPERB VIEWS OF THE
FORESTS STREAMS BLUFFS HILLS AND DALES BELOW AND BEYOND FOR MILES ARE
BROUGHT WITHIN ITS FOCUS
WHAT GRANDER RIVER SCENERY CAN BE CONCEIVED
AS WE GAZE UPON THIS ENCHANTING LANDSCAPE FROM THE UPPERMOST POINT OF
THESE BLUFFS UPON THE VALLEYS BELOW THE PRIMEVAL WILDNESS AND AWFUL
LONELINESS OF THESE SUBLIME CREATIONS OF NATURE AND NATURE'S GOD EXCITE
FEELINGS OF UNBOUNDED ADMIRATION AND THE RECOLLECTION OF WHICH CAN
NEVER BE EFFACED FROM THE MEMORY AS WE VIEW THEM IN ANY DIRECTION
'NEXT WE HAVE THE LION'S HEAD AND THE LIONESS'S HEAD CARVED BY NATURE'S
HAND TO ADORN AND DOMINATE THE BEAUTEOUS STREAM AND THEN ANON THE
RIVER WIDENS AND A MOST CHARMING AND MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF THE VALLEY
BEFORE US SUDDENLY BURSTS UPON OUR VISION RUGGED HILLS CLAD WITH
VERDANT FORESTS FROM SUMMIT TO BASE LEVEL PRAIRIE LANDS HOLDING IN
THEIR LAP THE BEAUTIFUL WABASHA CITY OF THE HEALING WATERS PUISSANT
FOE OF BRIGHT'S DISEASE AND THAT GRANDEST CONCEPTION OF NATURE'S
WORKS INCOMPARABLE LAKE PEPIN THESE CONSTITUTE A PICTURE WHEREON THE
TOURIST'S EYE MAY GAZE UNCOUNTED HOURS WITH RAPTURE UNAPPEASED AND
UNAPPEASABLE
'AND SO WE GLIDE ALONG IN DUE TIME ENCOUNTERING THOSE MAJESTIC DOMES
THE MIGHTY SUGAR LOAF AND THE SUBLIME MAIDEN'S ROCK WHICH LATTER
ROMANTIC SUPERSTITION HAS INVESTED WITH A VOICE AND OFT TIMES AS THE
BIRCH CANOE GLIDES NEAR AT TWILIGHT THE DUSKY PADDLER FANCIES HE HEARS

SCHOOL HOUSE EVER IN HIS FRONT STRETCH ARID LAWLESSNESS IGNORANCE
CRIME DESPAIR EVER IN HIS WAKE BLOOM THE JAIL THE GALLOWS AND THE
PULPIT AND EVER
'HAVE YOU EVER TRAVELED WITH A PANORAMA
'I HAVE FORMERLY SERVED IN THAT CAPACITY
MY SUSPICION WAS CONFIRMED
'DO YOU STILL TRAVEL WITH IT
'NO SHE IS LAID UP TILL THE FALL SEASON OPENS
I AM HELPING NOW TO WORK
UP THE MATERIALS FOR A TOURIST'S GUIDE WHICH THE ST
LOUIS AND ST
PAUL PACKET COMPANY ARE GOING TO ISSUE THIS SUMMER FOR THE BENEFIT OF
TRAVELERS WHO GO BY THAT LINE
'WHEN YOU WERE TALKING OF MAIDEN'S ROCK YOU SPOKE OF THE LONG DEPARTED
WINONA DARLING OF INDIAN SONG AND STORY
IS SHE THE MAIDEN OF THE
ROCK AND ARE THE TWO CONNECTED BY LEGEND
'YES AND A VERY TRAGIC AND PAINFUL ONE
PERHAPS THE MOST CELEBRATED AS
WELL AS THE MOST PATHETIC OF ALL THE LEGENDS OF THE MISSISSIPPI
WE ASKED HIM TO TELL IT
HE DROPPED OUT OF HIS CONVERSATIONAL VEIN AND
BACK INTO HIS LECTURE GAIT WITHOUT AN EFFORT AND ROLLED ON AS FOLLOWS
'A LITTLE DISTANCE ABOVE LAKE CITY IS A FAMOUS POINT KNOWN AS MAIDEN'S
ROCK WHICH IS NOT ONLY A PICTURESQUE SPOT BUT IS FULL OF ROMANTIC
INTEREST FROM THE EVENT WHICH GAVE IT ITS NAME NOT MANY YEARS AGO THIS
LOCALITY WAS A FAVORITE RESORT FOR THE SIOUX INDIANS ON ACCOUNT OF THE
FINE FISHING AND HUNTING TO BE HAD THERE AND LARGE NUMBERS OF THEM WERE
ALWAYS TO BE FOUND IN THIS LOCALITY
AMONG THE FAMILIES WHICH USED
TO RESORT HERE WAS ONE BELONGING TO THE TRIBE OF WABASHA
WE NO NA
FIRST BORN WAS THE NAME OF A MAIDEN WHO HAD PLIGHTED HER TROTH TO A
LOVER BELONGING TO THE SAME BAND
BUT HER STERN PARENTS HAD PROMISED HER
HAND TO ANOTHER A FAMOUS WARRIOR AND INSISTED ON HER WEDDING HIM
THE
DAY WAS FIXED BY HER PARENTS TO HER GREAT GRIEF
SHE APPEARED TO ACCEDE
TO THE PROPOSAL AND ACCOMPANY THEM TO THE ROCK FOR THE PURPOSE OF
GATHERING FLOWERS FOR THE FEAST
ON REACHING THE ROCK WE NO NA RAN
TO ITS SUMMIT AND STANDING ON ITS EDGE UPBRAIDED HER PARENTS WHO WERE
BELOW FOR THEIR CRUELTY AND THEN SINGING A DEATH DIRGE THREW HERSELF
FROM THE PRECIPICE AND DASHED THEM IN PIECES ON THE ROCK BELOW
'DASHED WHO IN PIECES HER PARENTS
'YES
'WELL IT CERTAINLY WAS A TRAGIC BUSINESS AS YOU SAY
AND MOREOVER
THERE IS A STARTLING KIND OF DRAMATIC SURPRISE ABOUT IT WHICH I WAS NOT
LOOKING FOR
IT IS A DISTINCT IMPROVEMENT UPON THE THREADBARE FORM OF
INDIAN LEGEND
THERE ARE FIFTY LOVER'S LEAPS ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI FROM
WHOSE SUMMIT DISAPPOINTED INDIAN GIRLS HAVE JUMPED BUT THIS IS THE ONLY
JUMP IN THE LOT HAT TURNED OUT IN THE RIGHT AND SATISFACTORY WAY
WHAT
BECAME OF WINONA
'SHE WAS A GOOD DEAL JARRED UP AND JOLTED BUT SHE GOT HERSELF TOGETHER
AND DISAPPEARED BEFORE THE CORONER REACHED THE FATAL SPOT AND 'TIS
SAID SHE SOUGHT AND MARRIED HER TRUE LOVE AND WANDERED WITH HIM TO
SOME DISTANT CLIME WHERE SHE LIVED HAPPY EVER AFTER HER GENTLE SPIRIT
MELLOWED AND CHASTENED BY THE ROMANTIC INCIDENT WHICH HAD SO EARLY
DEPRIVED HER OF THE SWEET GUIDANCE OF A MOTHER'S LOVE AND A FATHER'S
PROTECTING ARM AND THROWN HER ALL UNFRIENDED UPON THE COLD CHARITY OF
A CENSORIOUS WORLD
I WAS GLAD TO HEAR THE LECTURER'S DESCRIPTION OF THE SCENERY FOR IT
ASSISTED MY APPRECIATION OF WHAT I SAW OF IT AND ENABLED ME TO IMAGINE
SUCH OF IT AS WE LOST BY THE INTRUSION OF NIGHT
AS THE LECTURER REMARKED THIS WHOLE REGION IS BLANKETED WITH INDIAN
TALES AND TRADITIONS
BUT I REMINDED HIM THAT PEOPLE USUALLY MERELY
MENTION THIS FACT DOING IT IN A WAY TO MAKE A BODY'S MOUTH WATER AND
JUDICIOUSLY STOPPED THERE
WHY BECAUSE THE IMPRESSION LEFT WAS THAT
THESE TALES WERE FULL OF INCIDENT AND IMAGINATION A PLEASANT IMPRESSION
WHICH WOULD BE PROMPTLY DISSIPATED IF THE TALES WERE TOLD
I SHOWED HIM
A LOT OF THIS SORT OF LITERATURE WHICH I HAD BEEN COLLECTING AND HE
CONFESSED THAT IT WAS POOR STUFF EXCEEDINGLY SORRY RUBBISH AND I
VENTURED TO ADD THAT THE LEGENDS WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF TOLD US WERE OF
THIS CHARACTER WITH THE SINGLE EXCEPTION OF THE ADMIRABLE STORY OF
WINONA
HE GRANTED THESE FACTS BUT SAID THAT IF I WOULD HUNT UP MR
SCHOOLCRAFT'S BOOK PUBLISHED NEAR FIFTY YEARS AGO AND NOW DOUBTLESS
OUT OF PRINT I WOULD FIND SOME INDIAN INVENTIONS IN IT THAT WERE VERY
FAR FROM BEING BARREN OF INCIDENT AND IMAGINATION THAT THE TALES IN
HIAWATHA WERE OF THIS SORT AND THEY CAME FROM SCHOOLCRAFT'S BOOK AND
THAT THERE WERE OTHERS IN THE SAME BOOK WHICH MR
LONGFELLOW COULD HAVE
TURNED INTO VERSE WITH GOOD EFFECT
FOR INSTANCE THERE WAS THE LEGEND
OF 'THE UNDYING HEAD HE COULD NOT TELL IT FOR MANY OF THE DETAILS
HAD GROWN DIM IN HIS MEMORY BUT HE WOULD RECOMMEND ME TO FIND IT AND
ENLARGE MY RESPECT FOR THE INDIAN IMAGINATION
HE SAID THAT THIS TALE
AND MOST OF THE OTHERS IN THE BOOK WERE CURRENT AMONG THE INDIANS
ALONG THIS PART OF THE MISSISSIPPI WHEN HE FIRST CAME HERE AND THAT
THE CONTRIBUTORS TO SCHOOLCRAFT'S BOOK HAD GOT THEM DIRECTLY FROM INDIAN
LIPS AND HAD WRITTEN THEM DOWN WITH STRICT EXACTNESS AND WITHOUT
EMBELLISHMENTS OF THEIR OWN
I HAVE FOUND THE BOOK
THE LECTURER WAS RIGHT
THERE ARE SEVERAL LEGENDS
IN IT WHICH CONFIRM WHAT HE SAID
I WILL OFFER TWO OF THEM 'THE UNDYING
HEAD AND 'PEBOAN AND SEEGWUN AN ALLEGORY OF THE SEASONS THE LATTER
IS USED IN HIAWATHA BUT IT IS WORTH READING IN THE ORIGINAL FORM IF
ONLY THAT ONE MAY SEE HOW EFFECTIVE A GENUINE POEM CAN BE WITHOUT THE
HELPS AND GRACES OF POETIC MEASURE AND RHYTHM
PEBOAN AND SEEGWUN
AN OLD MAN WAS SITTING ALONE IN HIS LODGE BY THE SIDE OF A FROZEN
STREAM
IT WAS THE CLOSE OF WINTER AND HIS FIRE WAS ALMOST OUT HE
APPEARED VERY OLD AND VERY DESOLATE
HIS LOCKS WERE WHITE WITH AGE AND
HE TREMBLED IN EVERY JOINT
DAY AFTER DAY PASSED IN SOLITUDE AND HE
HEARD NOTHING BUT THE SOUND OF THE TEMPEST SWEEPING BEFORE IT THE
NEW FALLEN SNOW
ONE DAY AS HIS FIRE WAS JUST DYING A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN APPROACHED AND
ENTERED HIS DWELLING
HIS CHEEKS WERE RED WITH THE BLOOD OF YOUTH
HIS EYES SPARKLED WITH ANIMATION AND A SMILE PLAYED UPON HIS LIPS
HE
WALKED WITH A LIGHT AND QUICK STEP
HIS FOREHEAD WAS BOUND WITH A WREATH
OF SWEET GRASS IN PLACE OF A WARRIOR'S FRONTLET AND HE CARRIED A BUNCH
OF FLOWERS IN HIS HAND
'AH MY SON SAID THE OLD MAN 'I AM HAPPY TO SEE YOU
COME IN
COME
AND TELL ME OF YOUR ADVENTURES AND WHAT STRANGE LANDS YOU HAVE BEEN TO
SEE
LET US PASS THE NIGHT TOGETHER
I WILL TELL YOU OF MY PROWESS AND
EXPLOITS AND WHAT I CAN PERFORM
YOU SHALL DO THE SAME AND WE WILL
AMUSE OURSELVES
HE THEN DREW FROM HIS SACK A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT ANTIQUE PIPE AND HAVING
FILLED IT WITH TOBACCO RENDERED MILD BY A MIXTURE OF CERTAIN LEAVES
HANDED IT TO HIS GUEST
WHEN THIS CEREMONY WAS CONCLUDED THEY BEGAN TO
SPEAK
'I BLOW MY BREATH SAID THE OLD MAN 'AND THE STREAM STANDS STILL
THE
WATER BECOMES STIFF AND HARD AS CLEAR STONE
'I BREATHE SAID THE YOUNG MAN 'AND FLOWERS SPRING UP OVER THE PLAIN
'I SHAKE MY LOCKS RETORTED THE OLD MAN 'AND SNOW COVERS THE LAND
THE
LEAVES FALL FROM THE TREES AT MY COMMAND AND MY BREATH BLOWS THEM AWAY
THE BIRDS GET UP FROM THE WATER AND FLY TO A DISTANT LAND
THE ANIMALS
HIDE THEMSELVES FROM MY BREATH AND THE VERY GROUND BECOMES AS HARD AS
FLINT
'I SHAKE MY RINGLETS REJOINED THE YOUNG MAN 'AND WARM SHOWERS OF
SOFT RAIN FALL UPON THE EARTH
THE PLANTS LIFT UP THEIR HEADS OUT OF
THE EARTH LIKE THE EYES OF CHILDREN GLISTENING WITH DELIGHT
MY VOICE
RECALLS THE BIRDS
THE WARMTH OF MY BREATH UNLOCKS THE STREAMS
MUSIC
FILLS THE GROVES WHEREVER I WALK AND ALL NATURE REJOICES
AT LENGTH THE SUN BEGAN TO RISE
A GENTLE WARMTH CAME OVER THE PLACE
THE TONGUE OF THE OLD MAN BECAME SILENT
THE ROBIN AND BLUEBIRD BEGAN
TO SING ON THE TOP OF THE LODGE
THE STREAM BEGAN TO MURMUR BY THE DOOR
AND THE FRAGRANCE OF GROWING HERBS AND FLOWERS CAME SOFTLY ON THE VERNAL
BREEZE
DAYLIGHT FULLY REVEALED TO THE YOUNG MAN THE CHARACTER OF HIS
ENTERTAINER
WHEN HE LOOKED UPON HIM HE HAD THE ICY VISAGE OF
PEBOAN FOOTNOTE WINTER STREAMS BEGAN TO FLOW FROM HIS EYES
AS THE
SUN INCREASED HE GREW LESS AND LESS IN STATURE AND ANON HAD MELTED
COMPLETELY AWAY
NOTHING REMAINED ON THE PLACE OF HIS LODGE FIRE BUT THE
MISKODEED FOOTNOTE THE TRAILING ARBUTUS A SMALL WHITE FLOWER WITH
A PINK BORDER WHICH IS ONE OF THE EARLIEST SPECIES OF NORTHERN PLANTS
'THE UNDYING HEAD' IS A RATHER LONG TALE BUT IT MAKES UP IN WEIRD
CONCEITS FAIRY TALE PRODIGIES VARIETY OF INCIDENT AND ENERGY OF
MOVEMENT FOR WHAT IT LACKS IN BREVITY FOOTNOTE SEE APPENDIX D
CHAPTER 60
SPECULATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
WE REACHED ST
PAUL AT THE HEAD OF NAVIGATION OF THE MISSISSIPPI AND
THERE OUR VOYAGE OF TWO THOUSAND MILES FROM NEW ORLEANS ENDED
IT IS
ABOUT A TEN DAY TRIP BY STEAMER
IT CAN PROBABLY BE DONE QUICKER BY
RAIL
I JUDGE SO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ONE MAY GO BY RAIL FROM ST
LOUIS
TO HANNIBAL A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES IN SEVEN
HOURS
THIS IS BETTER THAN WALKING UNLESS ONE IS IN A HURRY
THE SEASON BEING FAR ADVANCED WHEN WE WERE IN NEW ORLEANS THE ROSES AND
MAGNOLIA BLOSSOMS WERE FALLING BUT HERE IN ST
PAUL IT WAS THE SNOW
IN NEW ORLEANS WE HAD CAUGHT AN OCCASIONAL WITHERING BREATH FROM OVER A
CRATER APPARENTLY HERE IN ST
PAUL WE CAUGHT A FREQUENT BENUMBING ONE
FROM OVER A GLACIER APPARENTLY
BUT I WANDER FROM MY THEME
ST
PAUL IS A WONDERFUL TOWN
IT IS PUT
TOGETHER IN SOLID BLOCKS OF HONEST BRICK AND STONE AND HAS THE AIR OF
INTENDING TO STAY
ITS POST OFFICE WAS ESTABLISHED THIRTY SIX YEARS AGO
AND BY AND BY WHEN THE POSTMASTER RECEIVED A LETTER HE CARRIED IT TO
WASHINGTON HORSEBACK TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS TO BE DONE WITH IT
SUCH IS
THE LEGEND
TWO FRAME HOUSES WERE BUILT THAT YEAR AND SEVERAL PERSONS
WERE ADDED TO THE POPULATION
A RECENT NUMBER OF THE LEADING ST
PAUL
PAPER THE 'PIONEER PRESS GIVES SOME STATISTICS WHICH FURNISH A VIVID
CONTRAST TO THAT OLD STATE OF THINGS TO WIT POPULATION AUTUMN OF THE
PRESENT YEAR 1882 71 000 NUMBER OF LETTERS HANDLED FIRST HALF OF
THE YEAR 1 209 387 NUMBER OF HOUSES BUILT DURING THREE QUARTERS OF
THE YEAR 989 THEIR COST 3 186 000
THE INCREASE OF LETTERS OVER THE
CORRESPONDING SIX MONTHS OF LAST YEAR WAS FIFTY PER CENT
LAST YEAR
THE NEW BUILDINGS ADDED TO THE CITY COST ABOVE 4 500 000
ST
PAUL'S STRENGTH LIES IN HER COMMERCE I MEAN HIS COMMERCE
HE IS A
MANUFACTURING CITY OF COURSE ALL THE CITIES OF THAT REGION ARE BUT
HE IS PECULIARLY STRONG IN THE MATTER OF COMMERCE
LAST YEAR HIS JOBBING
TRADE AMOUNTED TO UPWARDS OF 52 000 000
HE HAS A CUSTOM HOUSE AND IS BUILDING A COSTLY CAPITOL TO REPLACE THE
ONE RECENTLY BURNED FOR HE IS THE CAPITAL OF THE STATE
HE HAS CHURCHES
WITHOUT END AND NOT THE CHEAP POOR KIND BUT THE KIND THAT THE RICH
PROTESTANT PUTS UP THE KIND THAT THE POOR IRISH 'HIRED GIRL' DELIGHTS
TO ERECT
WHAT A PASSION FOR BUILDING MAJESTIC CHURCHES THE IRISH
HIRED GIRL HAS
IT IS A FINE THING FOR OUR ARCHITECTURE BUT TOO OFTEN WE
ENJOY HER STATELY FANES WITHOUT GIVING HER A GRATEFUL THOUGHT
IN
FACT INSTEAD OF REFLECTING THAT 'EVERY BRICK AND EVERY STONE IN THIS
BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE REPRESENTS AN ACHE OR A PAIN AND A HANDFUL OF SWEAT
AND HOURS OF HEAVY FATIGUE CONTRIBUTED BY THE BACK AND FOREHEAD AND
BONES OF POVERTY IT IS OUR HABIT TO FORGET THESE THINGS ENTIRELY
AND MERELY GLORIFY THE MIGHTY TEMPLE ITSELF WITHOUT VOUCHSAFING ONE
PRAISEFUL THOUGHT TO ITS HUMBLE BUILDER WHOSE RICH HEART AND WITHERED
PURSE IT SYMBOLIZES
THIS IS A LAND OF LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS
ST
PAUL HAS THREE PUBLIC
LIBRARIES AND THEY CONTAIN IN THE AGGREGATE SOME FORTY THOUSAND
BOOKS
HE HAS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN SCHOOL HOUSES AND PAYS OUT MORE
THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN TEACHERS' SALARIES
THERE IS AN UNUSUALLY FINE RAILWAY STATION SO LARGE IS IT IN FACT
THAT IT SEEMED SOMEWHAT OVERDONE IN THE MATTER OF SIZE AT FIRST
BUT AT THE END OF A FEW MONTHS IT WAS PERCEIVED THAT THE MISTAKE WAS
DISTINCTLY THE OTHER WAY
THE ERROR IS TO BE CORRECTED
THE TOWN STANDS ON HIGH GROUND IT IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FEET ABOVE
THE SEA LEVEL
IT IS SO HIGH THAT A WIDE VIEW OF RIVER AND LOWLAND IS
OFFERED FROM ITS STREETS
IT IS A VERY WONDERFUL TOWN INDEED AND IS NOT FINISHED YET
ALL
THE STREETS ARE OBSTRUCTED WITH BUILDING MATERIAL AND THIS IS BEING
COMPACTED INTO HOUSES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE FOR
OTHER PEOPLE ARE ANXIOUS TO BUILD AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET THE USE OF
THE STREETS TO PILE UP THEIR BRICKS AND STUFF IN
HOW SOLEMN AND BEAUTIFUL IS THE THOUGHT THAT THE EARLIEST PIONEER OF
CIVILIZATION THE VAN LEADER OF CIVILIZATION IS NEVER THE STEAMBOAT
NEVER THE RAILROAD NEVER THE NEWSPAPER NEVER THE SABBATH SCHOOL NEVER
THE MISSIONARY BUT ALWAYS WHISKEY SUCH IS THE CASE
LOOK HISTORY OVER
YOU WILL SEE
THE MISSIONARY COMES AFTER THE WHISKEY I MEAN HE ARRIVES
AFTER THE WHISKEY HAS ARRIVED NEXT COMES THE POOR IMMIGRANT WITH AX
AND HOE AND RIFLE NEXT THE TRADER NEXT THE MISCELLANEOUS RUSH NEXT
THE GAMBLER THE DESPERADO THE HIGHWAYMAN AND ALL THEIR KINDRED IN SIN
OF BOTH SEXES AND NEXT THE SMART CHAP WHO HAS BOUGHT UP AN OLD GRANT
THAT COVERS ALL THE LAND THIS BRINGS THE LAWYER TRIBE THE VIGILANCE

IT ALWAYS IS
IT WAS LIKE A

THIS GREAT VAN LEADER ARRIVED UPON THE GROUND WHICH ST

OCCUPIES IN JUNE 1837
YES AT THAT DATE PIERRE PARRANT A CANADIAN

THESE EXTRAORDINARY TOWNS WERE TEN MILES APART A FEW MONTHS AGO BUT
WERE GROWING SO FAST THAT THEY MAY POSSIBLY BE JOINED NOW AND GETTING

AT ANY RATE WITHIN FIVE YEARS FROM

STRETCHING BETWEEN THEM AND UNITING THEM THAT A STRANGER WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO TELL WHERE THE ONE SIAMESE TWIN LEAVES OFF AND THE OTHER BEGINS
COMBINED THEY WILL THEN NUMBER A POPULATION OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

BEGIN A RIVALRY AS TO NUMBERS WITH THAT CENTER OF POPULATION AT THE
FOOT OF IT NEW ORLEANS

THE WHITE BEAR LAKE IS LESS KNOWN
IT IS A LOVELY
SHEET OF WATER AND IS BEING UTILIZED AS A SUMMER RESORT BY THE WEALTH
AND FASHION OF THE STATE
IT HAS ITS CLUB HOUSE AND ITS HOTEL WITH THE
MODERN IMPROVEMENTS AND CONVENIENCES ITS FINE SUMMER RESIDENCES AND
PLENTY OF FISHING HUNTING AND PLEASANT DRIVES
THERE ARE A DOZEN MINOR
SUMMER RESORTS AROUND ABOUT ST
PAUL AND MINNEAPOLIS BUT THE WHITE BEAR
LAKE IS THE RESORT
CONNECTED WITH WHITE BEAR LAKE IS A MOST IDIOTIC
INDIAN LEGEND
I WOULD RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO PRINT IT HERE IF I
COULD BUT THE TASK IS BEYOND MY STRENGTH
THE GUIDE BOOK NAMES THE
PRESERVER OF THE LEGEND AND COMPLIMENTS HIS 'FACILE PEN WITHOUT
FURTHER COMMENT OR DELAY THEN LET US TURN THE SAID FACILE PEN LOOSE
UPON THE READER
A LEGEND OF WHITE BEAR LAKE
EVERY SPRING FOR PERHAPS A CENTURY OR AS LONG AS THERE HAS BEEN A
NATION OF RED MEN AN ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF WHITE BEAR LAKE HAS BEEN
VISITED BY A BAND OF INDIANS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING MAPLE SUGAR
TRADITION SAYS THAT MANY SPRINGS AGO WHILE UPON THIS ISLAND A YOUNG
WARRIOR LOVED AND WOOED THE DAUGHTER OF HIS CHIEF AND IT IS SAID ALSO
THE MAIDEN LOVED THE WARRIOR
HE HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN BEEN REFUSED HER
HAND BY HER PARENTS THE OLD CHIEF ALLEGING THAT HE WAS NO BRAVE AND
HIS OLD CONSORT CALLED HIM A WOMAN
THE SUN HAD AGAIN SET UPON THE 'SUGAR BUSH AND THE BRIGHT MOON ROSE
HIGH IN THE BRIGHT BLUE HEAVENS WHEN THE YOUNG WARRIOR TOOK DOWN HIS
FLUTE AND WENT OUT ALONE ONCE MORE TO SING THE STORY OF HIS LOVE THE
MILD BREEZE GENTLY MOVED THE TWO GAY FEATHERS IN HIS HEAD DRESS AND AS
HE MOUNTED ON THE TRUNK OF A LEANING TREE THE DAMP SNOW FELL FROM HIS
FEET HEAVILY
AS HE RAISED HIS FLUTE TO HIS LIPS HIS BLANKET SLIPPED
FROM HIS WELL FORMED SHOULDERS AND LAY PARTLY ON THE SNOW BENEATH
HE
BEGAN HIS WEIRD WILD LOVE SONG BUT SOON FELT THAT HE WAS COLD AND AS
HE REACHED BACK FOR HIS BLANKET SOME UNSEEN HAND LAID IT GENTLY ON HIS
SHOULDERS IT WAS THE HAND OF HIS LOVE HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL
SHE TOOK HER
PLACE BESIDE HIM AND FOR THE PRESENT THEY WERE HAPPY FOR THE INDIAN
HAS A HEART TO LOVE AND IN THIS PRIDE HE IS AS NOBLE AS IN HIS OWN
FREEDOM WHICH MAKES HIM THE CHILD OF THE FOREST
AS THE LEGEND RUNS A
LARGE WHITE BEAR THINKING PERHAPS THAT POLAR SNOWS AND DISMAL WINTER
WEATHER EXTENDED EVERYWHERE TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY SOUTHWARD
HE AT LENGTH
APPROACHED THE NORTHERN SHORE OF THE LAKE WHICH NOW BEARS HIS NAME
WALKED DOWN THE BANK AND MADE HIS WAY NOISELESSLY THROUGH THE DEEP HEAVY
SNOW TOWARD THE ISLAND
IT WAS THE SAME SPRING ENSUING THAT THE LOVERS
MET
THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FIRST RETREAT AND WERE NOW SEATED AMONG THE
BRANCHES OF A LARGE ELM WHICH HUNG FAR OVER THE LAKE
THE SAME TREE IS
STILL STANDING AND EXCITES UNIVERSAL CURIOSITY AND INTEREST FOR FEAR
OF BEING DETECTED THEY TALKED ALMOST IN A WHISPER AND NOW THAT THEY
MIGHT GET BACK TO CAMP IN GOOD TIME AND THEREBY AVOID SUSPICION THEY
WERE JUST RISING TO RETURN WHEN THE MAIDEN UTTERED A SHRIEK WHICH WAS
HEARD AT THE CAMP AND BOUNDING TOWARD THE YOUNG BRAVE SHE CAUGHT HIS
BLANKET BUT MISSED THE DIRECTION OF HER FOOT AND FELL BEARING THE
BLANKET WITH HER INTO THE GREAT ARMS OF THE FEROCIOUS MONSTER
INSTANTLY
EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD OF THE BAND WERE UPON THE BANK BUT ALL
UNARMED
CRIES AND WAILINGS WENT UP FROM EVERY MOUTH
WHAT WAS TO BE
DONE' IN THE MEANTIME THIS WHITE AND SAVAGE BEAST HELD THE BREATHLESS
MAIDEN IN HIS HUGE GRASP AND FONDLED WITH HIS PRECIOUS PREY AS IF HE
WERE USED TO SCENES LIKE THIS
ONE DEAFENING YELL FROM THE LOVER WARRIOR
IS HEARD ABOVE THE CRIES OF HUNDREDS OF HIS TRIBE AND DASHING AWAY
TO HIS WIGWAM HE GRASPS HIS FAITHFUL KNIFE RETURNS ALMOST AT A SINGLE
BOUND TO THE SCENE OF FEAR AND FRIGHT RUSHES OUT ALONG THE LEANING TREE
TO THE SPOT WHERE HIS TREASURE FELL AND SPRINGING WITH THE FURY OF
A MAD PANTHER POUNCED UPON HIS PREY
THE ANIMAL TURNED AND WITH ONE
STROKE OF HIS HUGE PAW BROUGHT THE LOVERS HEART TO HEART BUT THE NEXT
MOMENT THE WARRIOR WITH ONE PLUNGE OF THE BLADE OF HIS KNIFE OPENED
THE CRIMSON SLUICES OF DEATH AND THE DYING BEAR RELAXED HIS HOLD
THAT NIGHT THERE WAS NO MORE SLEEP FOR THE BAND OR THE LOVERS AND AS
THE YOUNG AND THE OLD DANCED ABOUT THE CARCASS OF THE DEAD MONSTER THE
GALLANT WARRIOR WAS PRESENTED WITH ANOTHER PLUME AND ERE ANOTHER MOON
HAD SET HE HAD A LIVING TREASURE ADDED TO HIS HEART
THEIR CHILDREN FOR
MANY YEARS PLAYED UPON THE SKIN OF THE WHITE BEAR FROM WHICH THE LAKE
DERIVES ITS NAME AND THE MAIDEN AND THE BRAVE REMEMBERED LONG THE
FEARFUL SCENE AND RESCUE THAT MADE THEM ONE FOR KIS SE ME PA AND
KA GO KA COULD NEVER FORGET THEIR FEARFUL ENCOUNTER WITH THE HUGE
MONSTER THAT CAME SO NEAR SENDING THEM TO THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUND
IT IS A PERPLEXING BUSINESS
FIRST SHE FELL DOWN OUT OF THE TREE SHE
AND THE BLANKET AND THE BEAR CAUGHT HER AND FONDLED HER HER AND THE
BLANKET THEN SHE FELL UP INTO THE TREE AGAIN LEAVING THE BLANKET
MEANTIME THE LOVER GOES WAR WHOOPING HOME AND COMES BACK 'HEELED
CLIMBS THE TREE JUMPS DOWN ON THE BEAR THE GIRL JUMPS DOWN AFTER
HIM APPARENTLY FOR SHE WAS UP THE TREE RESUMES HER PLACE IN THE
BEAR'S ARMS ALONG WITH THE BLANKET THE LOVER RAMS HIS KNIFE INTO THE
BEAR AND SAVES WHOM THE BLANKET NO NOTHING OF THE SORT
YOU GET
YOURSELF ALL WORKED UP AND EXCITED ABOUT THAT BLANKET AND THEN ALL OF
A SUDDEN JUST WHEN A HAPPY CLIMAX SEEMS IMMINENT YOU ARE LET DOWN
FLAT NOTHING SAVED BUT THE GIRL
WHEREAS ONE IS NOT INTERESTED IN
THE GIRL SHE IS NOT THE PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE LEGEND
NEVERTHELESS
THERE YOU ARE LEFT AND THERE YOU MUST REMAIN FOR IF YOU LIVE A
THOUSAND YEARS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHO GOT THE BLANKET
A DEAD MAN COULD
GET UP A BETTER LEGEND THAN THIS ONE
I DON'T MEAN A FRESH DEAD MAN
EITHER I MEAN A MAN THAT'S BEEN DEAD WEEKS AND WEEKS
WE STRUCK THE HOME TRAIL NOW AND IN A FEW HOURS WERE IN THAT
ASTONISHING CHICAGO A CITY WHERE THEY ARE ALWAYS RUBBING THE LAMP AND
FETCHING UP THE GENII AND CONTRIVING AND ACHIEVING NEW IMPOSSIBILITIES
IT IS HOPELESS FOR THE OCCASIONAL VISITOR TO TRY TO KEEP UP WITH
CHICAGO SHE OUTGROWS HIS PROPHECIES FASTER THAN HE CAN MAKE THEM
SHE IS ALWAYS A NOVELTY FOR SHE IS NEVER THE CHICAGO YOU SAW WHEN YOU
PASSED THROUGH THE LAST TIME
THE PENNSYLVANIA ROAD RUSHED US TO NEW
YORK WITHOUT MISSING SCHEDULE TIME TEN MINUTES ANYWHERE ON THE ROUTE
AND THERE ENDED ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE FIVE THOUSAND MILE JOURNEYS I
HAVE EVER HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MAKE
APPENDIX
APPENDIX A
FROM THE NEW ORLEANS TIMES DEMOCRAT OF MARCH 29 1882
VOYAGE OF THE TIMES DEMOCRAT'S RELIEF BOAT THROUGH THE INUNDATED REGIONS
IT WAS NINE O'CLOCK THURSDAY MORNING WHEN THE 'SUSIE' LEFT THE
MISSISSIPPI AND ENTERED OLD RIVER OR WHAT IS NOW CALLED THE MOUTH OF
THE RED
ASCENDING ON THE LEFT A FLOOD WAS POURING IN THROUGH AND OVER
THE LEVEES ON THE CHANDLER PLANTATION THE MOST NORTHERN POINT IN POINTE
COUPEE PARISH
THE WATER COMPLETELY COVERED THE PLACE ALTHOUGH THE
LEVEES HAD GIVEN WAY BUT A SHORT TIME BEFORE
THE STOCK HAD BEEN
GATHERED IN A LARGE FLAT BOAT WHERE WITHOUT FOOD AS WE PASSED THE
ANIMALS WERE HUDDLED TOGETHER WAITING FOR A BOAT TO TOW THEM OFF
ON
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE RIVER IS TURNBULL'S ISLAND AND ON IT IS A
LARGE PLANTATION WHICH FORMERLY WAS PRONOUNCED ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE
IN THE STATE
THE WATER HAS HITHERTO ALLOWED IT TO GO SCOT FREE IN USUAL
FLOODS BUT NOW BROAD SHEETS OF WATER TOLD ONLY WHERE FIELDS WERE
THE
TOP OF THE PROTECTING LEVEE COULD BE SEEN HERE AND THERE BUT NEARLY ALL
OF IT WAS SUBMERGED
THE TREES HAVE PUT ON A GREENER FOLIAGE SINCE THE WATER HAS POURED IN
AND THE WOODS LOOK BRIGHT AND FRESH BUT THIS PLEASANT ASPECT TO THE EYE
IS NEUTRALIZED BY THE INTERMINABLE WASTE OF WATER
WE PASS MILE AFTER
MILE AND IT IS NOTHING BUT TREES STANDING UP TO THEIR BRANCHES IN
WATER
A WATER TURKEY NOW AND AGAIN RISES AND FLIES AHEAD INTO THE LONG
AVENUE OF SILENCE
A PIROGUE SOMETIMES FLITS FROM THE BUSHES AND CROSSES
THE RED RIVER ON ITS WAY OUT TO THE MISSISSIPPI BUT THE SAD FACED
PADDLERS NEVER TURN THEIR HEADS TO LOOK AT OUR BOAT
THE PUFFING OF THE
BOAT IS MUSIC IN THIS GLOOM WHICH AFFECTS ONE MOST CURIOUSLY
IT IS NOT
THE GLOOM OF DEEP FORESTS OR DARK CAVERNS BUT A PECULIAR KIND OF SOLEMN
SILENCE AND IMPRESSIVE AWE THAT HOLDS ONE PERFORCE TO ITS RECOGNITION
WE PASSED TWO NEGRO FAMILIES ON A RAFT TIED UP IN THE WILLOWS THIS
MORNING
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY OF THE WELL TO DO CLASS AS THEY HAD A
SUPPLY OF MEAL AND THREE OR FOUR HOGS WITH THEM
THEIR RAFTS WERE ABOUT
TWENTY FEET SQUARE AND IN FRONT OF AN IMPROVISED SHELTER EARTH HAD BEEN
PLACED ON WHICH THEY BUILT THEIR FIRE
THE CURRENT RUNNING DOWN THE ATCHAFALAYA WAS VERY SWIFT THE MISSISSIPPI
SHOWING A PREDILECTION IN THAT DIRECTION WHICH NEEDS ONLY TO BE SEEN TO
ENFORCE THE OPINION OF THAT RIVER'S DESPERATE ENDEAVORS TO FIND A SHORT
WAY TO THE GULF
SMALL BOATS SKIFFS PIROGUES ETC ARE IN GREAT
DEMAND AND MANY HAVE BEEN STOLEN BY PIRATICAL NEGROES WHO TAKE THEM
WHERE THEY WILL BRING THE GREATEST PRICE
FROM WHAT WAS TOLD ME BY MR
C
P
FERGUSON A PLANTER NEAR RED RIVER LANDING WHOSE PLACE HAS JUST
GONE UNDER THERE IS MUCH SUFFERING IN THE REAR OF THAT PLACE
THE
NEGROES HAD GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHTS OF A CREVASSE THERE AS THE UPPER
LEVEE HAD STOOD SO LONG AND WHEN IT DID COME THEY WERE AT ITS MERCY
ON THURSDAY A NUMBER WERE TAKEN OUT OF TREES AND OFF OF CABIN ROOFS AND
BROUGHT IN MANY YET REMAINING
ONE DOES NOT APPRECIATE THE SIGHT OF EARTH UNTIL HE HAS TRAVELED THROUGH
A FLOOD
AT SEA ONE DOES NOT EXPECT OR LOOK FOR IT BUT HERE WITH
FLUTTERING LEAVES SHADOWY FOREST AISLES HOUSE TOPS BARELY VISIBLE IT
IS EXPECTED
IN FACT A GRAVE YARD IF THE MOUNDS WERE ABOVE WATER WOULD
BE APPRECIATED
THE RIVER HERE IS KNOWN ONLY BECAUSE THERE IS AN OPENING
IN THE TREES AND THAT IS ALL
IT IS IN WIDTH FROM FORT ADAMS ON THE
LEFT BANK OF THE MISSISSIPPI TO THE BANK OF RAPIDES PARISH A DISTANCE
OF ABOUT SIXTY MILES
A LARGE PORTION OF THIS WAS UNDER CULTIVATION
PARTICULARLY ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI AND BACK OF THE RED
WHEN RED RIVER
PROPER WAS ENTERED A STRONG CURRENT WAS RUNNING DIRECTLY ACROSS IT
PURSUING THE SAME DIRECTION AS THAT OF THE MISSISSIPPI
AFTER A RUN OF SOME HOURS BLACK RIVER WAS REACHED
HARDLY WAS IT
ENTERED BEFORE SIGNS OF SUFFERING BECAME VISIBLE
ALL THE WILLOWS
ALONG THE BANKS WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR LEAVES
ONE MAN WHOM YOUR
CORRESPONDENT SPOKE TO SAID THAT HE HAD HAD ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY HEAD
OF CATTLE AND ONE HUNDRED HEAD OF HOGS
AT THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF WATER
HE HAD STARTED TO DRIVE THEM TO THE HIGH LANDS OF AVOYELLES THIRTY FIVE
MILES OFF BUT HE LOST FIFTY HEAD OF THE BEEF CATTLE AND SIXTY HOGS
BLACK RIVER IS QUITE PICTURESQUE EVEN IF ITS SHORES ARE UNDER WATER
A DENSE GROWTH OF ASH OAK GUM AND HICKORY MAKE THE SHORES ALMOST
IMPENETRABLE AND WHERE ONE CAN GET A VIEW DOWN SOME AVENUE IN
THE TREES ONLY THE DIM OUTLINES OF DISTANT TRUNKS CAN BE BARELY
DISTINGUISHED IN THE GLOOM
A FEW MILES UP THIS RIVER THE DEPTH OF WATER ON THE BANKS WAS FULLY
EIGHT FEET AND ON ALL SIDES COULD BE SEEN STILL HOLDING AGAINST THE
STRONG CURRENT THE TOPS OF CABINS
HERE AND THERE ONE OVERTURNED WAS
SURROUNDED BY DRIFT WOOD FORMING THE NUCLEUS OF POSSIBLY SOME FUTURE
ISLAND
IN ORDER TO SAVE COAL AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THAT FUEL AT ANY
POINT TO BE TOUCHED DURING THE EXPEDITION A LOOK OUT WAS KEPT FOR A
WOOD PILE
ON ROUNDING A POINT A PIROGUE SKILFULLY PADDLED BY A YOUTH
SHOT OUT AND IN ITS BOW WAS A GIRL OF FIFTEEN OF FAIR FACE BEAUTIFUL
BLACK EYES AND DEMURE MANNERS
THE BOY ASKED FOR A PAPER WHICH WAS
THROWN TO HIM AND THE COUPLE PUSHED THEIR TINY CRAFT OUT INTO THE SWELL
OF THE BOAT
PRESENTLY A LITTLE GIRL NOT CERTAINLY OVER TWELVE YEARS PADDLED OUT IN
THE SMALLEST LITTLE CANOE AND HANDLED IT WITH ALL THE DEFTNESS OF AN OLD
VOYAGEUR
THE LITTLE ONE LOOKED MORE LIKE AN INDIAN THAN A WHITE CHILD
AND LAUGHED WHEN ASKED IF SHE WERE AFRAID
SHE HAD BEEN RAISED IN A
PIROGUE AND COULD GO ANYWHERE
SHE WAS BOUND OUT TO PICK WILLOW LEAVES
FOR THE STOCK AND SHE POINTED TO A HOUSE NEAR BY WITH WATER THREE
INCHES DEEP ON THE FLOORS
AT ITS BACK DOOR WAS MOORED A RAFT ABOUT
THIRTY FEET SQUARE WITH A SORT OF FENCE BUILT UPON IT AND INSIDE OF
THIS SOME SIXTEEN COWS AND TWENTY HOGS WERE STANDING
THE FAMILY DID NOT
COMPLAIN EXCEPT ON ACCOUNT OF LOSING THEIR STOCK AND PROMPTLY BROUGHT
A SUPPLY OF WOOD IN A FLAT
FROM THIS POINT TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER FIFTEEN MILES THERE IS NOT
A SPOT OF EARTH ABOVE WATER AND TO THE WESTWARD FOR THIRTY FIVE MILES
THERE IS NOTHING BUT THE RIVER'S FLOOD
BLACK RIVER HAD RISEN DURING
THURSDAY THE 23RD 1 THREE QUARTERS INCHES AND WAS GOING UP AT NIGHT
STILL
AS WE PROGRESS UP THE RIVER HABITATIONS BECOME MORE FREQUENT
BUT ARE YET STILL MILES APART
NEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE DESERTED AND THE
OUT HOUSES FLOATED OFF
TO ADD TO THE GLOOM ALMOST EVERY LIVING THING
SEEMS TO HAVE DEPARTED AND NOT A WHISTLE OF A BIRD NOR THE BARK OF
THE SQUIRREL CAN BE HEARD IN THIS SOLITUDE
SOMETIMES A MOROSE GAR
WILL THROW HIS TAIL ALOFT AND DISAPPEAR IN THE RIVER BUT BEYOND THIS
EVERYTHING IS QUIET THE QUIET OF DISSOLUTION
DOWN THE RIVER FLOATS
NOW A NEATLY WHITEWASHED HEN HOUSE THEN A CLUSTER OF NEATLY SPLIT
FENCE RAILS OR A DOOR AND A BLOATED CARCASS SOLEMNLY GUARDED BY A PAIR
OF BUZZARDS THE ONLY BIRD TO BE SEEN WHICH FEAST ON THE CARCASS AS IT
BEARS THEM ALONG
A PICTURE FRAME IN WHICH THERE WAS A CHEAP LITHOGRAPH
OF A SOLDIER ON HORSEBACK AS IT FLOATED ON TOLD OF SOME HEARTH INVADED
BY THE WATER AND DESPOILED OF THIS ORNAMENT
AT DARK AS IT WAS NOT PRUDENT TO RUN A PLACE ALONGSIDE THE WOODS WAS
HUNTED AND TO A TALL GUM TREE THE BOAT WAS MADE FAST FOR THE NIGHT
A PRETTY QUARTER OF THE MOON THREW A PLEASANT LIGHT OVER FOREST AND
RIVER MAKING A PICTURE THAT WOULD BE A DELIGHTFUL PIECE OF LANDSCAPE
STUDY COULD AN ARTIST ONLY HOLD IT DOWN TO HIS CANVAS
THE MOTION OF
THE ENGINES HAD CEASED THE PUFFING OF THE ESCAPING STEAM WAS STILLED
AND THE ENVELOPING SILENCE CLOSED UPON US AND SUCH SILENCE IT WAS
USUALLY IN A FOREST AT NIGHT ONE CAN HEAR THE PIPING OF FROGS THE HUM
OF INSECTS OR THE DROPPING OF LIMBS BUT HERE NATURE WAS DUMB
THE DARK
RECESSES THOSE AISLES INTO THIS CATHEDRAL GAVE FORTH NO SOUND AND
EVEN THE RIPPLINGS OF THE CURRENT DIE AWAY
AT DAYLIGHT FRIDAY MORNING ALL HANDS WERE UP AND UP THE BLACK WE
STARTED
THE MORNING WAS A BEAUTIFUL ONE AND THE RIVER WHICH IS
REMARKABLY STRAIGHT PUT ON ITS LOVELIEST GARB
THE BLOSSOMS OF THE HAW
PERFUMED THE AIR DELICIOUSLY AND A FEW BIRDS WHISTLED BLITHELY ALONG
THE BANKS
THE TREES WERE LARGER AND THE FOREST SEEMED OF OLDER GROWTH
THAN BELOW
MORE FIELDS WERE PASSED THAN NEARER THE MOUTH BUT THE SAME
SCENE PRESENTED ITSELF SMOKE HOUSES DRIFTING OUT IN THE PASTURES
NEGRO QUARTERS ANCHORED IN CONFUSION AGAINST SOME OAK AND THE MODEST
RESIDENCE JUST SHOWING ITS EAVES ABOVE WATER
THE SUN CAME UP IN A
GLORY OF CARMINE AND THE TREES WERE BRILLIANT IN THEIR VARIED SHADES
OF GREEN
NOT A FOOT OF SOIL IS TO BE SEEN ANYWHERE AND THE WATER IS
APPARENTLY GROWING DEEPER AND DEEPER FOR IT REACHES UP TO THE BRANCHES
OF THE LARGEST TREES
ALL ALONG THE BORDERING WILLOWS HAVE BEEN DENUDED
OF LEAVES SHOWING HOW LONG THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AT WORK GATHERING THIS
FODDER FOR THEIR ANIMALS
AN OLD MAN IN A PIROGUE WAS ASKED HOW THE
WILLOW LEAVES AGREED WITH HIS CATTLE
HE STOPPED IN HIS WORK AND WITH
AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD REPLIED 'WELL SIR IT 'S ENOUGH TO KEEP
WARMTH IN THEIR BODIES AND THAT'S ALL WE EXPECT BUT IT'S HARD ON THE
HOGS PARTICULARLY THE SMALL ONES
THEY IS DROPPING OFF POWERFUL FAST
BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO IT 'S ALL WE'VE GOT
AT THIRTY MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF BLACK RIVER THE WATER EXTENDS FROM
NATCHEZ ON THE MISSISSIPPI ACROSS TO THE PINE HILLS OF LOUISIANA A
DISTANCE OF SEVENTY THREE MILES AND THERE IS HARDLY A SPOT THAT IS NOT
TEN FEET UNDER IT
THE TENDENCY OF THE CURRENT UP THE BLACK IS TOWARD
THE WEST
IN FACT SO MUCH IS THIS THE CASE THE WATERS OF RED RIVER
HAVE BEEN DRIVEN DOWN FROM TOWARD THE CALCASIEU COUNTRY AND THE WATERS
OF THE BLACK ENTER THE RED SOME FIFTEEN MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE
FORMER A THING NEVER BEFORE SEEN BY EVEN THE OLDEST STEAMBOATMEN
THE
WATER NOW IN SIGHT OF US IS ENTIRELY FROM THE MISSISSIPPI
UP TO TRINITY OR RATHER TROY WHICH IS BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BELOW
THE PEOPLE HAVE NEARLY ALL MOVED OUT THOSE REMAINING HAVING ENOUGH FOR
THEIR PRESENT PERSONAL NEEDS
THEIR CATTLE THOUGH ARE SUFFERING AND
DYING OFF QUITE FAST AS THE CONFINEMENT ON RAFTS AND THE FOOD THEY GET
BREEDS DISEASE
AFTER A SHORT STOP WE STARTED AND SOON CAME TO A SECTION WHERE THERE
WERE MANY OPEN FIELDS AND CABINS THICKLY SCATTERED ABOUT
HERE WERE SEEN
MORE PICTURES OF DISTRESS
ON THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSES THE INMATES
HAD BUILT ON BOXES A SCAFFOLD ON WHICH THEY PLACED THE FURNITURE
THE
BED POSTS WERE SAWED OFF ON TOP AS THE CEILING WAS NOT MORE THAN FOUR
FEET FROM THE IMPROVISED FLOOR
THE BUILDINGS LOOKED VERY INSECURE
AND THREATENED EVERY MOMENT TO FLOAT OFF
NEAR THE HOUSES WERE CATTLE
STANDING BREAST HIGH IN THE WATER PERFECTLY IMPASSIVE
THEY DID NOT
MOVE IN THEIR PLACES BUT STOOD PATIENTLY WAITING FOR HELP TO COME
THE
SIGHT WAS A DISTRESSING ONE AND THE POOR CREATURES WILL BE SURE TO
DIE UNLESS SPEEDILY RESCUED
CATTLE DIFFER FROM HORSES IN THIS PECULIAR
QUALITY
A HORSE AFTER FINDING NO RELIEF COMES WILL SWIM OFF IN SEARCH
OF FOOD WHEREAS A BEEF WILL STAND IN ITS TRACKS UNTIL WITH EXHAUSTION
IT DROPS IN THE WATER AND DROWNS
AT HALF PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK A HAIL WAS GIVEN FROM A FLAT BOAT INSIDE THE
LINE OF THE BANK
ROUNDING TO WE RAN ALONGSIDE AND GENERAL YORK STEPPED
ABOARD
HE WAS JUST THEN ENGAGED IN GETTING OFF STOCK AND WELCOMED THE
'TIMES DEMOCRAT' BOAT HEARTILY AS HE SAID THERE WAS MUCH NEED FOR HER
HE SAID THAT THE DISTRESS WAS NOT EXAGGERATED IN THE LEAST
PEOPLE WERE
IN A CONDITION IT WAS DIFFICULT EVEN FOR ONE TO IMAGINE
THE WATER WAS
SO HIGH THERE WAS GREAT DANGER OF THEIR HOUSES BEING SWEPT AWAY
IT HAD
ALREADY RISEN SO HIGH THAT IT WAS APPROACHING THE EAVES AND WHEN IT
REACHES THIS POINT THERE IS ALWAYS IMMINENT RISK OF THEIR BEING SWEPT
AWAY
IF THIS OCCURS THERE WILL BE GREAT LOSS OF LIFE
THE GENERAL
SPOKE OF THE GALLANT WORK OF MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO
SAVE THEIR STOCK BUT THOUGHT THAT FULLY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT
HAD
PERISHED
ALREADY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAD RECEIVED RATIONS FROM
TROY ON BLACK RIVER AND HE HAD TOWED OUT A GREAT MANY CATTLE BUT A
VERY GREAT QUANTITY REMAINED AND WERE IN DIRE NEED
THE WATER WAS NOW
EIGHTEEN INCHES HIGHER THAN IN 1874 AND THERE WAS NO LAND BETWEEN
VIDALIA AND THE HILLS OF CATAHOULA
AT TWO O'CLOCK THE 'SUSIE' REACHED TROY SIXTY FIVE MILES ABOVE THE
MOUTH OF BLACK RIVER
HERE ON THE LEFT COMES IN LITTLE RIVER JUST
BEYOND THAT THE OUACHITA AND ON THE RIGHT THE TENSAS
THESE THREE
RIVERS FORM THE BLACK RIVER
TROY OR A PORTION OF IT IS SITUATED ON
AND AROUND THREE LARGE INDIAN MOUNDS CIRCULAR IN SHAPE WHICH RISE
ABOVE THE PRESENT WATER ABOUT TWELVE FEET
THEY ARE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED
AND FIFTY FEET IN DIAMETER AND ARE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS APART
THE
HOUSES ARE ALL BUILT BETWEEN THESE MOUNDS AND HENCE ARE ALL FLOODED TO
A DEPTH OF EIGHTEEN INCHES ON THEIR FLOORS
THESE ELEVATIONS BUILT BY THE ABORIGINES HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO ARE
THE ONLY POINTS OF REFUGE FOR MILES
WHEN WE ARRIVED WE FOUND THEM
CROWDED WITH STOCK ALL OF WHICH WAS THIN AND HARDLY ABLE TO STAND UP
THEY WERE MIXED TOGETHER SHEEP HOGS HORSES MULES AND CATTLE
ONE OF
THESE MOUNDS HAS BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS AS THE GRAVE YARD AND TO DAY
WE SAW ATTENUATED COWS LYING AGAINST THE MARBLE TOMB STONES CHEWING
THEIR CUD IN CONTENTMENT AFTER A MEAL OF CORN FURNISHED BY GENERAL
YORK
HERE AS BELOW THE REMARKABLE SKILL OF THE WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THE
MANAGEMENT OF THE SMALLER PIROGUES WAS NOTICED
CHILDREN WERE PADDLING
ABOUT IN THESE MOST TICKLISH CRAFTS WITH ALL THE NONCHALANCE OF ADEPTS
GENERAL YORK HAS PUT INTO OPERATION A PERFECT SYSTEM IN REGARD TO
FURNISHING RELIEF
HE MAKES A PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE PLACE WHERE IT
IS ASKED SEES WHAT IS NECESSARY TO BE DONE AND THEN HAVING TWO BOATS
CHARTERED WITH FLATS SENDS THEM PROMPTLY TO THE PLACE WHEN THE CATTLE
ARE LOADED AND TOWED TO THE PINE HILLS AND UPLANDS OF CATAHOULA
HE
HAS MADE TROY HIS HEADQUARTERS AND TO THIS POINT BOATS COME FOR THEIR
SUPPLY OF FEED FOR CATTLE
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF LITTLE RIVER WHICH
BRANCHES TO THE LEFT OUT OF BLACK AND BETWEEN IT AND THE OUACHITA
IS SITUATED THE TOWN OF TRINITY WHICH IS HOURLY THREATENED WITH
DESTRUCTION
IT IS MUCH LOWER THAN TROY AND THE WATER IS EIGHT AND NINE
FEET DEEP IN THE HOUSES
A STRONG CURRENT SWEEPS THROUGH IT AND IT IS
REMARKABLE THAT ALL OF ITS HOUSES HAVE NOT GONE BEFORE
THE RESIDENTS OF
BOTH TROY AND TRINITY HAVE BEEN CARED FOR YET SOME OF THEIR STOCK HAVE
TO BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD
AS SOON AS THE 'SUSIE' REACHED TROY SHE WAS TURNED OVER TO GENERAL
YORK AND PLACED AT HIS DISPOSITION TO CARRY OUT THE WORK OF RELIEF MORE
RAPIDLY
NEARLY ALL HER SUPPLIES WERE LANDED ON ONE OF THE MOUNDS TO
LIGHTEN HER AND SHE WAS HEADED DOWN STREAM TO RELIEVE THOSE BELOW
AT TOM HOOPER'S PLACE A FEW MILES FROM TROY A LARGE FLAT WITH ABOUT
FIFTY HEAD OF STOCK ON BOARD WAS TAKEN IN TOW
THE ANIMALS WERE FED
AND SOON REGAINED SOME STRENGTH
TO DAY WE GO ON LITTLE RIVER WHERE THE
SUFFERING IS GREATEST
DOWN BLACK RIVER
SATURDAY EVENING MARCH 25
WE STARTED DOWN BLACK RIVER QUITE EARLY UNDER THE DIRECTION OF GENERAL
YORK TO BRING OUT WHAT STOCK COULD BE REACHED
GOING DOWN RIVER A FLAT
IN TOW WAS LEFT IN A CENTRAL LOCALITY AND FROM THERE MEN POLED HER BACK
IN THE REAR OF PLANTATIONS PICKING UP THE ANIMALS WHEREVER FOUND
IN
THE LOFT OF A GIN HOUSE THERE WERE SEVENTEEN HEAD FOUND AND AFTER A
GANGWAY WAS BUILT THEY WERE LED DOWN INTO THE FLAT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
TAKING A SKIFF WITH THE GENERAL YOUR REPORTER WAS PULLED UP TO A LITTLE
HOUSE OF TWO ROOMS IN WHICH THE WATER WAS STANDING TWO FEET ON THE
FLOORS
IN ONE OF THE LARGE ROOMS WERE HUDDLED THE HORSES AND COWS OF
THE PLACE WHILE IN THE OTHER THE WIDOW TAYLOR AND HER SON WERE SEATED
ON A SCAFFOLD RAISED ON THE FLOOR
ONE OR TWO DUG OUTS WERE DRIFTING
ABOUT IN THE ROAM READY TO BE PUT IN SERVICE AT ANY TIME
WHEN THE FLAT
WAS BROUGHT UP THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS CUT AWAY AS THE ONLY MEANS OF
GETTING THE ANIMALS OUT AND THE CATTLE WERE DRIVEN ON BOARD THE BOAT
GENERAL YORK IN THIS AS IN EVERY CASE INQUIRED IF THE FAMILY DESIRED
TO LEAVE INFORMING THEM THAT MAJOR BURKE OF 'THE TIMES DEMOCRAT HAS
SENT THE 'SUSIE' UP FOR THAT PURPOSE
MRS
TAYLOR SAID SHE THANKED MAJOR
BURKE BUT SHE WOULD TRY AND HOLD OUT
THE REMARKABLE TENACITY OF THE
PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR HOMES IS BEYOND ALL COMPREHENSION
JUST BELOW AT
A POINT SIXTEEN MILES FROM TROY INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED THAT THE
HOUSE OF MR
TOM ELLIS WAS IN DANGER AND HIS FAMILY WERE ALL IN IT
WE
STEAMED THERE IMMEDIATELY AND A SAD PICTURE WAS PRESENTED
LOOKING OUT
OF THE HALF OF THE WINDOW LEFT ABOVE WATER WAS MRS
ELLIS WHO IS IN
FEEBLE HEALTH WHILST AT THE DOOR WERE HER SEVEN CHILDREN THE OLDEST
NOT FOURTEEN YEARS
ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE WAS GIVEN UP TO THE WORK
ANIMALS SOME TWELVE HEAD BESIDES HOGS
IN THE NEXT ROOM THE FAMILY
LIVED THE WATER COMING WITHIN TWO INCHES OF THE BED RAIL
THE STOVE WAS
BELOW WATER AND THE COOKING WAS DONE ON A FIRE ON TOP OF IT
THE HOUSE
THREATENED TO GIVE WAY AT ANY MOMENT ONE END OF IT WAS SINKING AND
IN FACT THE BUILDING LOOKED A MERE SHELL
AS THE BOAT ROUNDED TO MR
ELLIS CAME OUT IN A DUG OUT AND GENERAL YORK TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD COME
TO HIS RELIEF THAT 'THE TIMES DEMOCRAT' BOAT WAS AT HIS SERVICE AND
WOULD REMOVE HIS FAMILY AT ONCE TO THE HILLS AND ON MONDAY A FLAT
WOULD TAKE OUT HIS STOCK AS UNTIL THAT TIME THEY WOULD BE BUSY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DEPLORABLE SITUATION HIMSELF AND FAMILY WERE IN
MR
ELLIS DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE
HE SAID HE THOUGHT HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL
MONDAY AND TAKE THE RISK OF HIS HOUSE FALLING
THE CHILDREN AROUND THE
DOOR LOOKED PERFECTLY CONTENTED SEEMING TO CARE LITTLE FOR THE DANGER
THEY WERE IN
THESE ARE BUT TWO INSTANCES OF THE MANY
AFTER WEEKS OF
PRIVATION AND SUFFERING PEOPLE STILL CLING TO THEIR HOUSES AND LEAVE
ONLY WHEN THERE IS NOT ROOM BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE CEILING TO BUILD
A SCAFFOLD ON WHICH TO STAND
IT SEEMED TO BE INCOMPREHENSIBLE YET THE
LOVE FOR THE OLD PLACE WAS STRONGER THAN THAT FOR SAFETY
AFTER LEAVING THE ELLIS PLACE THE NEXT SPOT TOUCHED AT WAS THE OSWALD
PLACE
HERE THE FLAT WAS TOWED ALONGSIDE THE GIN HOUSE WHERE THERE WERE
FIFTEEN HEAD STANDING IN WATER AND YET AS THEY STOOD ON SCAFFOLDS
THEIR HEADS WERE ABOVE THE TOP OF THE ENTRANCE
IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE
TO GET THEM OUT WITHOUT CUTTING AWAY A PORTION OF THE FRONT AND SO
AXES WERE BROUGHT INTO REQUISITION AND A GAP MADE
AFTER MUCH LABOR THE
HORSES AND MULES WERE SECURELY PLACED ON THE FLAT
AT EACH PLACE WE STOP THERE ARE ALWAYS THREE FOUR OR MORE DUG OUTS
ARRIVING BRINGING INFORMATION OF STOCK IN OTHER PLACES IN NEED
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT A GREAT MANY HAD DRIVEN A PART OF THEIR
STOCK TO THE HILLS SOME TIME AGO THERE YET REMAINS A LARGE QUANTITY
WHICH GENERAL YORK WHO IS WORKING WITH INDOMITABLE ENERGY WILL GET
LANDED IN THE PINE HILLS BY TUESDAY
ALL ALONG BLACK RIVER THE 'SUSIE' HAS BEEN VISITED BY SCORES OF
PLANTERS WHOSE TALES ARE THE REPETITION OF THOSE ALREADY HEARD OF
SUFFERING AND LOSS
AN OLD PLANTER WHO HAS LIVED ON THE RIVER SINCE
1844 SAID THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A RISE AND HE WAS SATISFIED MORE THAN
ONE QUARTER OF THE STOCK HAS BEEN LOST
LUCKILY THE PEOPLE CARED FIRST
FOR THEIR WORK STOCK AND WHEN THEY COULD FIND IT HORSES AND MULES WERE
HOUSED IN A PLACE OF SAFETY
THE RISE WHICH STILL CONTINUES AND WAS TWO
INCHES LAST NIGHT COMPELS THEM TO GET THEM OUT TO THE HILLS HENCE IT
IS THAT THE WORK OF GENERAL YORK IS OF SUCH A GREAT VALUE
FROM DAYLIGHT
TO LATE AT NIGHT HE IS GOING THIS WAY AND THAT CHEERING BY HIS
KINDLY WORDS AND DIRECTING WITH CALM JUDGMENT WHAT IS TO BE DONE
ONE
UNPLEASANT STORY OF A CERTAIN MERCHANT IN NEW ORLEANS IS TOLD ALL
ALONG THE RIVER
IT APPEARS FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PLANTERS HAVE BEEN
DEALING WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL AND MANY OF THEM HAD BALANCES IN HIS
HANDS
WHEN THE OVERFLOW CAME THEY WROTE FOR COFFEE FOR MEAL AND IN
FACT FOR SUCH LITTLE NECESSITIES AS WERE REQUIRED
NO RESPONSE TO THESE
LETTERS CAME AND OTHERS WERE WRITTEN AND YET THESE OLD CUSTOMERS WITH
PLANTATIONS UNDER WATER WERE REFUSED EVEN WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN
LIFE
IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY HE IS NOT POPULAR NOW ON BACK RIVER
THE HILLS SPOKEN OF AS THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR THE PEOPLE AND STOCK ON
BLACK RIVER ARE IN CATAHOULA PARISH TWENTY FOUR MILES FROM BLACK RIVER
AFTER FILLING THE FLAT WITH CATTLE WE TOOK ON BOARD THE FAMILY OF T
S
HOOPER SEVEN IN NUMBER WHO COULD NOT LONGER REMAIN IN THEIR DWELLING
AND WE ARE NOW TAKING THEM UP LITTLE RIVER TO THE HILLS
THE FLOOD STILL RISING
TROY MARCH 27 1882 NOON
THE FLOOD HERE IS RISING ABOUT THREE AND A HALF INCHES EVERY TWENTY FOUR
HOURS AND RAINS HAVE SET IN WHICH WILL INCREASE THIS
GENERAL YORK
FEELS NOW THAT OUR EFFORTS OUGHT TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS SAVING LIFE AS
THE INCREASE OF THE WATER HAS JEOPARDIZED MANY HOUSES
WE INTEND TO
GO UP THE TENSAS IN A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WE WILL RETURN AND GO
DOWN BLACK RIVER TO TAKE OFF FAMILIES
THERE IS A LACK OF STEAM
TRANSPORTATION HERE TO MEET THE EMERGENCY
THE GENERAL HAS THREE BOATS
CHARTERED WITH FLATS IN TOW BUT THE DEMAND FOR THESE TO TOW OUT STOCK
IS GREATER THAN THEY CAN MEET WITH PROMPTNESS
ALL ARE WORKING NIGHT AND
DAY AND THE 'SUSIE' HARDLY STOPS FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR ANYWHERE
THE
RISE HAS PLACED TRINITY IN A DANGEROUS PLIGHT AND MOMENTARILY IT
IS EXPECTED THAT SOME OF THE HOUSES WILL FLOAT OFF
TROY IS A LITTLE
HIGHER YET ALL ARE IN THE WATER
REPORTS HAVE COME IN THAT A WOMAN
AND CHILD HAVE BEEN WASHED AWAY BELOW HERE AND TWO CABINS FLOATED
OFF
THEIR OCCUPANTS ARE THE SAME WHO REFUSED TO COME OFF DAY BEFORE
YESTERDAY
ONE WOULD NOT BELIEVE THE UTTER PASSIVENESS OF THE PEOPLE
AS YET NO NEWS HAS BEEN RECEIVED OF THE STEAMER 'DELIA WHICH IS
SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONE SUNK IN YESTERDAY'S STORM ON LAKE CATAHOULA
SHE IS DUE HERE NOW BUT HAS NOT ARRIVED
EVEN THE MAIL HERE IS MOST
UNCERTAIN AND THIS I SEND BY SKIFF TO NATCHEZ TO GET IT TO YOU
IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ACCURATE DATA AS TO PAST CROPS ETC AS THOSE WHO
KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE MATTER HAVE GONE AND THOSE WHO REMAIN ARE NOT WELL
VERSED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THIS SECTION
GENERAL YORK DESIRES ME TO SAY THAT THE AMOUNT OF RATIONS FORMERLY SENT
SHOULD BE DUPLICATED AND SENT AT ONCE
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ANY
ESTIMATE FOR THE PEOPLE ARE FLEEING TO THE HILLS SO RAPID IS THE
RISE
THE RESIDENTS HERE ARE IN A STATE OF COMMOTION THAT CAN ONLY BE
APPRECIATED WHEN SEEN AND COMPLETE DEMORALIZATION HAS SET IN
IF RATIONS ARE DRAWN FOR ANY PARTICULAR SECTION HEREABOUTS THEY WOULD
NOT BE CERTAIN TO BE DISTRIBUTED SO EVERYTHING SHOULD BE SENT TO TROY
AS A CENTER AND THE GENERAL WILL HAVE IT PROPERLY DISPOSED OF
HE
HAS SENT FOR ONE HUNDRED TENTS AND IF ALL GO TO THE HILLS WHO ARE IN
MOTION NOW TWO HUNDRED WILL BE REQUIRED
APPENDIX B
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION
THE CONDITION OF THIS RICH VALLEY OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI IMMEDIATELY
AFTER AND SINCE THE WAR CONSTITUTED ONE OF THE DISASTROUS EFFECTS OF
WAR MOST TO BE DEPLORED
FICTITIOUS PROPERTY IN SLAVES WAS NOT ONLY
RIGHTEOUSLY DESTROYED BUT VERY MUCH OF THE WORK WHICH HAD DEPENDED UPON
THE SLAVE LABOR WAS ALSO DESTROYED OR GREATLY IMPAIRED ESPECIALLY THE
LEVEE SYSTEM
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THOSE WHO HAVE NOT INVESTIGATED THE
SUBJECT THAT SUCH IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS AS THE CONSTRUCTION AND
MAINTENANCE OF THE LEVEES WOULD HAVE BEEN ASSUMED AT ONCE BY THE SEVERAL
STATES
BUT WHAT CAN THE STATE DO WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE UNDER SUBJECTION
TO RATES OF INTEREST RANGING FROM 18 TO 30 PER CENT AND ARE ALSO UNDER
THE NECESSITY OF PLEDGING THEIR CROPS IN ADVANCE EVEN OF PLANTING AT
THESE RATES FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF PURCHASING ALL OF THEIR SUPPLIES AT
100 PER CENT
PROFIT
IT HAS NEEDED BUT LITTLE ATTENTION TO MAKE IT PERFECTLY OBVIOUS THAT
THE CONTROL OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IF UNDERTAKEN AT ALL MUST BE
UNDERTAKEN BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND CANNOT BE COMPASSED BY
STATES
THE RIVER MUST BE TREATED AS A UNIT ITS CONTROL CANNOT BE
COMPASSED UNDER A DIVIDED OR SEPARATE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION
NEITHER ARE THE STATES ESPECIALLY INTERESTED COMPETENT TO COMBINE AMONG
THEMSELVES FOR THE NECESSARY OPERATIONS
THE WORK MUST BEGIN FAR UP THE
RIVER AT LEAST AS FAR AS CAIRO IF NOT BEYOND AND MUST BE CONDUCTED
UPON A CONSISTENT GENERAL PLAN THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE RIVER
IT DOES NOT NEED TECHNICAL OR SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE TO COMPREHEND THE
ELEMENTS OF THE CASE IF ONE WILL GIVE A LITTLE TIME AND ATTENTION TO THE
SUBJECT AND WHEN A MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION HAS BEEN CONSTITUTED
AS THE EXISTING COMMISSION IS OF THOROUGHLY ABLE MEN OF DIFFERENT WALKS
IN LIFE MAY IT NOT BE SUGGESTED THAT THEIR VERDICT IN THE CASE SHOULD
BE ACCEPTED AS CONCLUSIVE SO FAR AS ANY A PRIORI THEORY OF CONSTRUCTION
OR CONTROL CAN BE CONSIDERED CONCLUSIVE
IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT UPON THIS BOARD ARE GENERAL GILMORE
GENERAL COMSTOCK AND GENERAL SUTER OF THE UNITED STATES ENGINEERS
PROFESSOR HENRY MITCHELL THE MOST COMPETENT AUTHORITY ON THE QUESTION
OF HYDROGRAPHY OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY B
B
HARROD
THE STATE ENGINEER OF LOUISIANA JAS
B
EADS WHOSE SUCCESS WITH THE
JETTIES AT NEW ORLEANS IS A WARRANT OF HIS COMPETENCY AND JUDGE TAYLOR
OF INDIANA
IT WOULD BE PRESUMPTION ON THE PART OF ANY SINGLE MAN HOWEVER SKILLED
TO CONTEST THE JUDGMENT OF SUCH A BOARD AS THIS
THE METHOD OF IMPROVEMENT PROPOSED BY THE COMMISSION IS AT ONCE IN
ACCORD WITH THE RESULTS OF ENGINEERING EXPERIENCE AND WITH OBSERVATIONS
OF NATURE WHERE MEETING OUR WANTS
AS IN NATURE THE GROWTH OF TREES AND
THEIR PRONENESS WHERE UNDERMINED TO FALL ACROSS THE SLOPE AND SUPPORT
THE BANK SECURES AT SOME POINTS A FAIR DEPTH OF CHANNEL AND SOME DEGREE
OF PERMANENCE SO IN THE PROJECT OF THE ENGINEER THE USE OF TIMBER AND
BRUSH AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF FOREST GROWTH ARE THE MAIN FEATURES
IT
IS PROPOSED TO REDUCE THE WIDTH WHERE EXCESSIVE BY BRUSHWOOD DYKES AT
FIRST LOW BUT RAISED HIGHER AND HIGHER AS THE MUD OF THE RIVER SETTLES
UNDER THEIR SHELTER AND FINALLY SLOPE THEM BACK AT THE ANGLE UPON WHICH
WILLOWS WILL GROW FREELY
IN THIS WORK THERE ARE MANY DETAILS CONNECTED
WITH THE FORMS OF THESE SHELTER DYKES THEIR ARRANGEMENTS SO AS TO
PRESENT A SERIES OF SETTLING BASINS ETC A DESCRIPTION OF WHICH WOULD
ONLY COMPLICATE THE CONCEPTION
THROUGH THE LARGER PART OF THE RIVER
WORKS OF CONTRACTION WILL NOT BE REQUIRED BUT NEARLY ALL THE BANKS
ON THE CONCAVE SIDE OF THE BEDS MUST BE HELD AGAINST THE WEAR OF THE
STREAM AND MUCH OF THE OPPOSITE BANKS DEFENDED AT CRITICAL POINTS
THE WORKS HAVING IN VIEW THIS CONSERVATIVE OBJECT MAY BE GENERALLY
DESIGNATED WORKS OF REVETMENT AND THESE ALSO WILL BE LARGELY OF
BRUSHWOOD WOVEN IN CONTINUOUS CARPETS OR TWINED INTO WIRE NETTING
THIS VENEERING PROCESS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYED ON THE MISSOURI
RIVER AND IN SOME CASES THEY HAVE SO COVERED THEMSELVES WITH SEDIMENTS
AND HAVE BECOME SO OVERGROWN WITH WILLOWS THAT THEY MAY BE REGARDED AS
PERMANENT
IN SECURING THESE MATS RUBBLE STONE IS TO BE USED IN SMALL
QUANTITIES AND IN SOME INSTANCES THE DRESSED SLOPE BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW
RIVER WILL HAVE TO BE MORE OR LESS PAVED WITH STONE
ANY ONE WHO HAS BEEN ON THE RHINE WILL HAVE OBSERVED OPERATIONS NOT
UNLIKE THOSE TO WHICH WE HAVE JUST REFERRED AND INDEED MOST OF THE
RIVERS OF EUROPE FLOWING AMONG THEIR OWN ALLUVIA HAVE REQUIRED SIMILAR
TREATMENT IN THE INTEREST OF NAVIGATION AND AGRICULTURE
THE LEVEE IS THE CROWNING WORK OF BANK REVETMENT ALTHOUGH NOT
NECESSARILY IN IMMEDIATE CONNECTION
IT MAY BE SET BACK A SHORT DISTANCE
FROM THE REVETTED BANK BUT IT IS IN EFFECT THE REQUISITE PARAPET
THE FLOOD RIVER AND THE LOW RIVER CANNOT BE BROUGHT INTO REGISTER AND
COMPELLED TO UNITE IN THE EXCAVATION OF A SINGLE PERMANENT CHANNEL
WITHOUT A COMPLETE CONTROL OF ALL THE STAGES AND EVEN THE ABNORMAL RISE
MUST BE PROVIDED AGAINST BECAUSE THIS WOULD ENDANGER THE LEVEE AND
ONCE IN FORCE BEHIND THE WORKS OF REVETMENT WOULD TEAR THEM ALSO AWAY
UNDER THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT THE LOCAL SLOPE OF A RIVER IS THE
RESULT AND MEASURE OF THE RESISTANCE OF ITS BED IT IS EVIDENT THAT
A NARROW AND DEEP STREAM SHOULD HAVE LESS SLOPE BECAUSE IT HAS LESS
FRICTIONAL SURFACE IN PROPORTION TO CAPACITY I E LESS PERIMETER IN
PROPORTION TO AREA OF CROSS SECTION
THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF LEVEES AND
REVETMENTS CONFINING THE FLOODS AND BRINGING ALL THE STAGES OF THE RIVER
INTO REGISTER IS TO DEEPEN THE CHANNEL AND LET DOWN THE SLOPE
THE FIRST
EFFECT OF THE LEVEES IS TO RAISE THE SURFACE BUT THIS BY INDUCING
GREATER VELOCITY OF FLOW INEVITABLY CAUSES AN ENLARGEMENT OF SECTION
AND IF THIS ENLARGEMENT IS PREVENTED FROM BEING MADE AT THE EXPENSE OF
THE BANKS THE BOTTOM MUST GIVE WAY AND THE FORM OF THE WATERWAY BE SO
IMPROVED AS TO ADMIT THIS FLOW WITH LESS RISE
THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
WITH LEVEES UPON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH NO ATTEMPT TO HOLD THE
BANKS HAS BEEN FAVORABLE AND NO ONE CAN DOUBT UPON THE EVIDENCE
FURNISHED IN THE REPORTS OF THE COMMISSION THAT IF THE EARLIEST LEVEES
HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY REVETMENT OF BANKS AND MADE COMPLETE WE SHOULD
HAVE TO DAY A RIVER NAVIGABLE AT LOW WATER AND AN ADJACENT COUNTRY SAFE
FROM INUNDATION
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ILLOGICAL TO CONCLUDE THAT THE CONSTRAINED RIVER
CAN EVER LOWER ITS FLOOD SLOPE SO AS TO MAKE LEVEES UNNECESSARY BUT IT
IS BELIEVED THAT BY THIS LATERAL CONSTRAINT THE RIVER AS A CONDUIT MAY
BE SO IMPROVED IN FORM THAT EVEN THOSE RARE FLOODS WHICH RESULT FROM THE
COINCIDENT RISING OF MANY TRIBUTARIES WILL FIND VENT WITHOUT DESTROYING
LEVEES OF ORDINARY HEIGHT
THAT THE ACTUAL CAPACITY OF A CHANNEL THROUGH
ALLUVIUM DEPENDS UPON ITS SERVICE DURING FLOODS HAS BEEN OFTEN SHOWN
BUT THIS CAPACITY DOES NOT INCLUDE ANOMALOUS BUT RECURRENT FLOODS
IT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE TO CONSIDER THE PROJECTS FOR RELIEVING
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER FLOODS BY CREATING NEW OUTLETS SINCE THESE
SENSATIONAL PROPOSITIONS HAVE COMMENDED THEMSELVES ONLY TO UNTHINKING
MINDS AND HAVE NO SUPPORT AMONG ENGINEERS
WERE THE RIVER BED
CAST IRON A RESORT TO OPENINGS FOR SURPLUS WATERS MIGHT BE A NECESSITY
BUT AS THE BOTTOM IS YIELDING AND THE BEST FORM OF OUTLET IS A SINGLE
DEEP CHANNEL AS REALIZING THE LEAST RATIO OF PERIMETER TO AREA OF
CROSS SECTION THERE COULD NOT WELL BE A MORE UNPHILOSOPHICAL METHOD OF
TREATMENT THAN THE MULTIPLICATION OF AVENUES OF ESCAPE
IN THE FOREGOING STATEMENT THE ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO CONDENSE IN
AS LIMITED A SPACE AS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT WOULD PERMIT
THE GENERAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROBLEM AND THE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE
PROPOSED METHOD OF IMPROVEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER COMMISSION
THE WRITER CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT PRESUMPTUOUS ON HIS
PART TO ATTEMPT TO PRESENT THE FACTS RELATING TO AN ENTERPRISE WHICH
CALLS FOR THE HIGHEST SCIENTIFIC SKILL BUT IT IS A MATTER WHICH
INTERESTS EVERY CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES AND IS ONE OF THE METHODS
OF RECONSTRUCTION WHICH OUGHT TO BE APPROVED
IT IS A WAR CLAIM WHICH
IMPLIES NO PRIVATE GAIN AND NO COMPENSATION EXCEPT FOR ONE OF THE CASES
OF DESTRUCTION INCIDENT TO WAR WHICH MAY WELL BE REPAIRED BY THE PEOPLE
OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY

APPENDIX C
RECEPTION OF CAPTAIN BASIL HALL'S BOOK IN THE UNITED STATES
HAVING NOW ARRIVED NEARLY AT THE END OF OUR TRAVELS I AM INDUCED ERE I
CONCLUDE AGAIN TO MENTION WHAT I CONSIDER AS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE
TRAITS IN THE NATIONAL CHARACTER OF THE AMERICANS NAMELY THEIR
EXQUISITE SENSITIVENESS AND SORENESS RESPECTING EVERYTHING SAID OR
WRITTEN CONCERNING THEM
OF THIS PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE EXAMPLE I
CAN GIVE IS THE EFFECT PRODUCED ON NEARLY EVERY CLASS OF READERS BY THE
APPEARANCE OF CAPTAIN BASIL HALL'S 'TRAVELS IN NORTH AMERICA IN FACT
IT WAS A SORT OF MORAL EARTHQUAKE AND THE VIBRATION IT OCCASIONED
THROUGH THE NERVES OF THE REPUBLIC FROM ONE CORNER OF THE UNION TO
THE OTHER WAS BY NO MEANS OVER WHEN I LEFT THE COUNTRY IN JULY 1831 A
COUPLE OF YEARS AFTER THE SHOCK
I WAS IN CINCINNATI WHEN THESE VOLUMES CAME OUT BUT IT WAS NOT TILL
JULY 1830 THAT I PROCURED A COPY OF THEM
ONE BOOKSELLER TO WHOM I
APPLIED TOLD ME THAT HE HAD HAD A FEW COPIES BEFORE HE UNDERSTOOD THE
NATURE OF THE WORK BUT THAT AFTER BECOMING ACQUAINTED WITH IT NOTHING
SHOULD INDUCE HIM TO SELL ANOTHER
OTHER PERSONS OF HIS PROFESSION MUST
HOWEVER HAVE BEEN LESS SCRUPULOUS FOR THE BOOK WAS READ IN CITY TOWN
VILLAGE AND HAMLET STEAMBOAT AND STAGE COACH AND A SORT OF WAR WHOOP
WAS SENT FORTH PERFECTLY UNPRECEDENTED IN MY RECOLLECTION UPON ANY
OCCASION WHATEVER
AN ARDENT DESIRE FOR APPROBATION AND A DELICATE SENSITIVENESS UNDER
CENSURE HAVE ALWAYS I BELIEVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS AMIABLE TRAITS OF
CHARACTER BUT THE CONDITION INTO WHICH THE APPEARANCE OF CAPTAIN HALL'S
WORK THREW THE REPUBLIC SHOWS PLAINLY THAT THESE FEELINGS IF CARRIED TO
EXCESS PRODUCE A WEAKNESS WHICH AMOUNTS TO IMBECILITY
IT WAS PERFECTLY ASTONISHING TO HEAR MEN WHO ON OTHER SUBJECTS WERE
OF SOME JUDGMENT UTTER THEIR OPINIONS UPON THIS
I NEVER HEARD OF ANY
INSTANCE IN WHICH THE COMMONSENSE GENERALLY FOUND IN NATIONAL CRITICISM
WAS SO OVERTHROWN BY PASSION
I DO NOT SPEAK OF THE WANT OF JUSTICE AND
OF FAIR AND LIBERAL INTERPRETATION THESE PERHAPS WERE HARDLY TO BE
EXPECTED
OTHER NATIONS HAVE BEEN CALLED THIN SKINNED BUT THE CITIZENS
OF THE UNION HAVE APPARENTLY NO SKINS AT ALL THEY WINCE IF A BREEZE
BLOWS OVER THEM UNLESS IT BE TEMPERED WITH ADULATION
IT WAS NOT
THEREFORE VERY SURPRISING THAT THE ACUTE AND FORCIBLE OBSERVATIONS OF A
TRAVELER THEY KNEW WOULD BE LISTENED TO SHOULD BE RECEIVED TESTILY
THE
EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES OF THE BUSINESS WERE FIRST THE EXCESS OF THE
RAGE INTO WHICH THEY LASHED THEMSELVES AND SECONDLY THE PUERILITY OF
THE INVENTIONS BY WHICH THEY ATTEMPTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SEVERITY WITH
WHICH THEY FANCIED THEY HAD BEEN TREATED
NOT CONTENT WITH DECLARING THAT THE VOLUMES CONTAINED NO WORD OF TRUTH
FROM BEGINNING TO END WHICH IS AN ASSERTION I HEARD MADE VERY NEARLY AS
OFTEN AS THEY WERE MENTIONED THE WHOLE COUNTRY SET TO WORK TO DISCOVER
THE CAUSES WHY CAPTAIN HALL HAD VISITED THE UNITED STATES AND WHY HE
HAD PUBLISHED HIS BOOK
I HAVE HEARD IT SAID WITH AS MUCH PRECISION AND GRAVITY AS IF THE
STATEMENT HAD BEEN CONVEYED BY AN OFFICIAL REPORT THAT CAPTAIN HALL
HAD BEEN SENT OUT BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT EXPRESSLY FOR THE PURPOSE
OF CHECKING THE GROWING ADMIRATION OF ENGLAND FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
UNITED STATES THAT IT WAS BY A COMMISSION FROM THE TREASURY HE HAD
COME AND THAT IT WAS ONLY IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS THAT HE HAD FOUND
ANYTHING TO OBJECT TO
I DO NOT GIVE THIS AS THE GOSSIP OF A COTERIE I AM PERSUADED THAT IT IS
THE BELIEF OF A VERY CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
SO DEEP IS
THE CONVICTION OF THIS SINGULAR PEOPLE THAT THEY CANNOT BE SEEN WITHOUT
BEING ADMIRED THAT THEY WILL NOT ADMIT THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANY ONE
SHOULD HONESTLY AND SINCERELY FIND AUGHT TO DISAPPROVE IN THEM OR THEIR
COUNTRY
THE AMERICAN REVIEWS ARE MANY OF THEM I BELIEVE WELL KNOWN IN
ENGLAND I NEED NOT THEREFORE QUOTE THEM HERE BUT I SOMETIMES
WONDERED THAT THEY NONE OF THEM EVER THOUGHT OF TRANSLATING OBADIAH'S
CURSE INTO CLASSIC AMERICAN IF THEY HAD DONE SO ON PLACING HE BASIL
HALL BETWEEN BRACKETS INSTEAD OF HE OBADIAH IT WOULD HAVE SAVED
THEM A WORLD OF TROUBLE
I CAN HARDLY DESCRIBE THE CURIOSITY WITH WHICH I SAT DOWN AT LENGTH
TO PERUSE THESE TREMENDOUS VOLUMES STILL LESS CAN I DO JUSTICE TO MY
SURPRISE AT THEIR CONTENTS
TO SAY THAT I FOUND NOT ONE EXAGGERATED
STATEMENT THROUGHOUT THE WORK IS BY NO MEANS SAYING ENOUGH
IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE WHO KNOWS THE COUNTRY NOT TO SEE THAT CAPTAIN
HALL EARNESTLY SOUGHT OUT THINGS TO ADMIRE AND COMMEND
WHEN HE PRAISES
IT IS WITH EVIDENT PLEASURE AND WHEN HE FINDS FAULT IT IS WITH EVIDENT
RELUCTANCE AND RESTRAINT EXCEPTING WHERE MOTIVES PURELY PATRIOTIC URGE
HIM TO STATE ROUNDLY WHAT IT IS FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS COUNTRY SHOULD BE
KNOWN
IN FACT CAPTAIN HALL SAW THE COUNTRY TO THE GREATEST POSSIBLE
ADVANTAGE
FURNISHED OF COURSE WITH LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO THE
MOST DISTINGUISHED INDIVIDUALS AND WITH THE STILL MORE INFLUENTIAL
RECOMMENDATION OF HIS OWN REPUTATION HE WAS RECEIVED IN FULL
DRAWING ROOM STYLE AND STATE FROM ONE END OF THE UNION TO THE OTHER
HE SAW THE COUNTRY IN FULL DRESS AND HAD LITTLE OR NO OPPORTUNITY
OF JUDGING OF IT UNHOUSELLED UNANOINTED UNANNEALED WITH ALL ITS
IMPERFECTIONS ON ITS HEAD AS I AND MY FAMILY TOO OFTEN HAD
CAPTAIN HALL HAD CERTAINLY EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES OF MAKING HIMSELF
ACQUAINTED WITH THE FORM OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THE LAWS AND OF
RECEIVING MOREOVER THE BEST ORAL COMMENTARY UPON THEM IN CONVERSATION
WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZENS
OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES HE MADE
EXCELLENT USE NOTHING IMPORTANT MET HIS EYE WHICH DID NOT RECEIVE THAT
SORT OF ANALYTICAL ATTENTION WHICH AN EXPERIENCED AND PHILOSOPHICAL
TRAVELER ALONE CAN GIVE
THIS HAS MADE HIS VOLUMES HIGHLY INTERESTING
AND VALUABLE BUT I AM DEEPLY PERSUADED THAT WERE A MAN OF EQUAL
PENETRATION TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES WITH NO OTHER MEANS OF BECOMING
ACQUAINTED WITH THE NATIONAL CHARACTER THAN THE ORDINARY WORKING DAY
INTERCOURSE OF LIFE HE WOULD CONCEIVE AN INFINITELY LOWER IDEA OF THE
MORAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE COUNTRY THAN CAPTAIN HALL APPEARS TO HAVE DONE
AND THE INTERNAL CONVICTION ON MY MIND IS STRONG THAT IF CAPTAIN
HALL HAD NOT PLACED A FIRM RESTRAINT ON HIMSELF HE MUST HAVE GIVEN
EXPRESSION TO FAR DEEPER INDIGNATION THAN ANY HE HAS UTTERED AGAINST
MANY POINTS IN THE AMERICAN CHARACTER WITH WHICH HE SHOWS FROM OTHER
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED
HIS RULE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
TO STATE JUST SO MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS WOULD LEAVE ON THE MIND OF HIS
READERS A CORRECT IMPRESSION AT THE LEAST COST OF PAIN TO THE SENSITIVE
FOLKS HE WAS WRITING ABOUT
HE STATES HIS OWN OPINIONS AND FEELINGS AND
LEAVES IT TO BE INFERRED THAT HE HAS GOOD GROUNDS FOR ADOPTING THEM
BUT HE SPARES THE AMERICANS THE BITTERNESS WHICH A DETAIL OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE PRODUCED
IF ANY ONE CHOOSES TO SAY THAT SOME WICKED ANTIPATHY TO TWELVE MILLIONS
OF STRANGERS IS THE ORIGIN OF MY OPINION I MUST BEAR IT AND WERE THE
QUESTION ONE OF MERE IDLE SPECULATION I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT COURT THE
ABUSE I MUST MEET FOR STATING IT
BUT IT IS NOT SO
THE CANDOR WHICH HE EXPRESSES AND EVIDENTLY FEELS THEY MISTAKE FOR
IRONY OR TOTALLY DISTRUST HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO GIVE PAIN TO
PERSONS FROM WHOM HE HAS RECEIVED KINDNESS THEY SCORNFULLY REJECT AS
AFFECTATION AND ALTHOUGH THEY MUST KNOW RIGHT WELL IN THEIR OWN SECRET
HEARTS HOW INFINITELY MORE THEY LAY AT HIS MERCY THAN HE HAS CHOSEN TO
BETRAY THEY PRETEND EVEN TO THEMSELVES THAT HE HAS EXAGGERATED THE
BAD POINTS OF THEIR CHARACTER AND INSTITUTIONS WHEREAS THE TRUTH IS
THAT HE HAS LET THEM OFF WITH A DEGREE OF TENDERNESS WHICH MAY BE QUITE
SUITABLE FOR HIM TO EXERCISE HOWEVER LITTLE MERITED WHILE AT THE
SAME TIME HE HAS MOST INDUSTRIOUSLY MAGNIFIED THEIR MERITS WHENEVER HE
COULD POSSIBLY FIND ANYTHING FAVORABLE
APPENDIX D
THE UNDYING HEAD
IN A REMOTE PART OF THE NORTH LIVED A MAN AND HIS SISTER WHO HAD NEVER
SEEN A HUMAN BEING
SELDOM IF EVER HAD THE MAN ANY CAUSE TO GO FROM
HOME FOR AS HIS WANTS DEMANDED FOOD HE HAD ONLY TO GO A LITTLE
DISTANCE FROM THE LODGE AND THERE IN SOME PARTICULAR SPOT PLACE HIS
ARROWS WITH THEIR BARBS IN THE GROUND
TELLING HIS SISTER WHERE THEY
HAD BEEN PLACED EVERY MORNING SHE WOULD GO IN SEARCH AND NEVER FAIL
OF FINDING EACH STUCK THROUGH THE HEART OF A DEER
SHE HAD THEN ONLY TO
DRAG THEM INTO THE LODGE AND PREPARE THEIR FOOD
THUS SHE LIVED TILL SHE
ATTAINED WOMANHOOD WHEN ONE DAY HER BROTHER WHOSE NAME WAS IAMO SAID
TO HER 'SISTER THE TIME IS AT HAND WHEN YOU WILL BE ILL
LISTEN TO MY
ADVICE
IF YOU DO NOT IT WILL PROBABLY BE THE CAUSE OF MY DEATH
TAKE
THE IMPLEMENTS WITH WHICH WE KINDLE OUR FIRES
GO SOME DISTANCE FROM OUR
LODGE AND BUILD A SEPARATE FIRE
WHEN YOU ARE IN WANT OF FOOD I WILL
TELL YOU WHERE TO FIND IT
YOU MUST COOK FOR YOURSELF AND I WILL FOR
MYSELF
WHEN YOU ARE ILL DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COME NEAR THE LODGE OR
BRING ANY OF THE UTENSILS YOU USE
BE SURE ALWAYS TO FASTEN TO YOUR BELT
THE IMPLEMENTS YOU NEED FOR YOU DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE TIME WILL COME
AS
FOR MYSELF I MUST DO THE BEST I CAN HIS SISTER PROMISED TO OBEY HIM
IN ALL HE HAD SAID
SHORTLY AFTER HER BROTHER HAD CAUSE TO GO FROM HOME
SHE WAS ALONE IN
HER LODGE COMBING HER HAIR
SHE HAD JUST UNTIED THE BELT TO WHICH THE
IMPLEMENTS WERE FASTENED WHEN SUDDENLY THE EVENT TO WHICH HER BROTHER
HAD ALLUDED OCCURRED
SHE RAN OUT OF THE LODGE BUT IN HER HASTE FORGOT
THE BELT
AFRAID TO RETURN SHE STOOD FOR SOME TIME THINKING
FINALLY
SHE DECIDED TO ENTER THE LODGE AND GET IT
FOR THOUGHT SHE MY BROTHER
IS NOT AT HOME AND I WILL STAY BUT A MOMENT TO CATCH HOLD OF IT
SHE
WENT BACK
RUNNING IN SUDDENLY SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF IT AND WAS COMING
OUT WHEN HER BROTHER CAME IN SIGHT
HE KNEW WHAT WAS THE MATTER
'OH
HE SAID 'DID I NOT TELL YOU TO TAKE CARE
BUT NOW YOU HAVE KILLED ME
SHE WAS GOING ON HER WAY BUT HER BROTHER SAID TO HER 'WHAT CAN YOU
DO THERE NOW
THE ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED
GO IN AND STAY WHERE YOU HAVE
ALWAYS STAYED
AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF YOU YOU HAVE KILLED ME
HE THEN LAID ASIDE HIS HUNTING DRESS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND SOON AFTER
BOTH HIS FEET BEGAN TO TURN BLACK SO THAT HE COULD NOT MOVE
STILL HE
DIRECTED HIS SISTER WHERE TO PLACE THE ARROWS THAT SHE MIGHT ALWAYS
HAVE FOOD
THE INFLAMMATION CONTINUED TO INCREASE AND HAD NOW REACHED
HIS FIRST RIB AND HE SAID 'SISTER MY END IS NEAR
YOU MUST DO AS
I TELL YOU
YOU SEE MY MEDICINE SACK AND MY WAR CLUB TIED TO IT
IT
CONTAINS ALL MY MEDICINES AND MY WAR PLUMES AND MY PAINTS OF ALL
COLORS
AS SOON AS THE INFLAMMATION REACHES MY BREAST YOU WILL TAKE MY
WAR CLUB
IT HAS A SHARP POINT AND YOU WILL CUT OFF MY HEAD
WHEN IT IS
FREE FROM MY BODY TAKE IT PLACE ITS NECK IN THE SACK WHICH YOU MUST
OPEN AT ONE END
THEN HANG IT UP IN ITS FORMER PLACE
DO NOT FORGET
MY BOW AND ARROWS
ONE OF THE LAST YOU WILL TAKE TO PROCURE FOOD
THE
REMAINDER TIE IN MY SACK AND THEN HANG IT UP SO THAT I CAN LOOK
TOWARDS THE DOOR
NOW AND THEN I WILL SPEAK TO YOU BUT NOT OFTEN HIS
SISTER AGAIN PROMISED TO OBEY
IN A LITTLE TIME HIS BREAST WAS AFFECTED
'NOW SAID HE 'TAKE THE
CLUB AND STRIKE OFF MY HEAD SHE WAS AFRAID BUT HE TOLD HER TO MUSTER
COURAGE
'STRIKE SAID HE AND A SMILE WAS ON HIS FACE
MUSTERING ALL
HER COURAGE SHE GAVE THE BLOW AND CUT OFF THE HEAD
'NOW SAID THE
HEAD 'PLACE ME WHERE I TOLD YOU AND FEARFULLY SHE OBEYED IT IN ALL
ITS COMMANDS
RETAINING ITS ANIMATION IT LOOKED AROUND THE LODGE
AS USUAL AND IT WOULD COMMAND ITS SISTER TO GO IN SUCH PLACES AS IT
THOUGHT WOULD PROCURE FOR HER THE FLESH OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS SHE NEEDED
ONE DAY THE HEAD SAID 'THE TIME IS NOT DISTANT WHEN I SHALL BE FREED
FROM THIS SITUATION AND I SHALL HAVE TO UNDERGO MANY SORE EVILS
SO
THE SUPERIOR MANITO DECREES AND I MUST BEAR ALL PATIENTLY IN THIS
SITUATION WE MUST LEAVE THE HEAD
IN A CERTAIN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS A VILLAGE INHABITED BY A NUMEROUS
AND WARLIKE BAND OF INDIANS
IN THIS VILLAGE WAS A FAMILY OF TEN YOUNG
MEN BROTHERS
IT WAS IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR THAT THE YOUNGEST OF
THESE BLACKENED HIS FACE AND FASTED
HIS DREAMS WERE PROPITIOUS
HAVING
ENDED HIS FAST HE WENT SECRETLY FOR HIS BROTHERS AT NIGHT SO THAT NONE
IN THE VILLAGE COULD OVERHEAR OR FIND OUT THE DIRECTION THEY INTENDED
TO GO
THOUGH THEIR DRUM WAS HEARD YET THAT WAS A COMMON OCCURRENCE
HAVING ENDED THE USUAL FORMALITIES HE TOLD HOW FAVORABLE HIS DREAMS
WERE AND THAT HE HAD CALLED THEM TOGETHER TO KNOW IF THEY WOULD
ACCOMPANY HIM IN A WAR EXCURSION
THEY ALL ANSWERED THEY WOULD
THE
THIRD BROTHER FROM THE ELDEST NOTED FOR HIS ODDITIES COMING UP WITH
HIS WAR CLUB WHEN HIS BROTHER HAD CEASED SPEAKING JUMPED UP
'YES
SAID HE 'I WILL GO AND THIS WILL BE THE WAY I WILL TREAT THOSE I AM
GOING TO FIGHT AND HE STRUCK THE POST IN THE CENTER OF THE LODGE AND
GAVE A YELL
THE OTHERS SPOKE TO HIM SAYING 'SLOW SLOW MUDJIKEWIS
WHEN YOU ARE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LODGES SO HE SAT DOWN
THEN IN TURN
THEY TOOK THE DRUM AND SANG THEIR SONGS AND CLOSED WITH A FEAST
THE
YOUNGEST TOLD THEM NOT TO WHISPER THEIR INTENTION TO THEIR WIVES BUT
SECRETLY TO PREPARE FOR THEIR JOURNEY
THEY ALL PROMISED OBEDIENCE AND
MUDJIKEWIS WAS THE FIRST TO SAY SO
THE TIME FOR THEIR DEPARTURE DREW NEAR
WORD WAS GIVEN TO ASSEMBLE ON A
CERTAIN NIGHT WHEN THEY WOULD DEPART IMMEDIATELY
MUDJIKEWIS WAS LOUD
IN HIS DEMANDS FOR HIS MOCCASINS
SEVERAL TIMES HIS WIFE ASKED HIM THE
REASON
'BESIDES SAID SHE 'YOU HAVE A GOOD PAIR ON 'QUICK QUICK
SAID HE 'SINCE YOU MUST KNOW WE ARE GOING ON A WAR EXCURSION SO BE
QUICK HE THUS REVEALED THE SECRET
THAT NIGHT THEY MET AND STARTED
THE SNOW WAS ON THE GROUND AND THEY TRAVELED ALL NIGHT LEST OTHERS
SHOULD FOLLOW THEM
WHEN IT WAS DAYLIGHT THE LEADER TOOK SNOW AND MADE
A BALL OF IT THEN TOSSING IT INTO THE AIR HE SAID 'IT WAS IN THIS WAY
I SAW SNOW FALL IN A DREAM SO THAT I COULD NOT BE TRACKED AND HE TOLD
THEM TO KEEP CLOSE TO EACH OTHER FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEMSELVES AS THE
SNOW BEGAN TO FALL IN VERY LARGE FLAKES
NEAR AS THEY WALKED IT WAS
WITH DIFFICULTY THEY COULD SEE EACH OTHER
THE SNOW CONTINUED FALLING
ALL THAT DAY AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT SO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACK
THEM
THEY HAD NOW WALKED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND MUDJIKEWIS WAS ALWAYS IN
THE REAR
ONE DAY RUNNING SUDDENLY FORWARD HE GAVE THE
SAW SAW QUAN FOOTNOTE WAR WHOOP AND STRUCK A TREE WITH HIS
WAR CLUB AND IT BROKE INTO PIECES AS IF STRUCK WITH LIGHTNING
'BROTHERS SAID HE 'THIS WILL BE THE WAY I WILL SERVE THOSE WE ARE
GOING TO FIGHT THE LEADER ANSWERED 'SLOW SLOW MUDJIKEWIS THE ONE I
LEAD YOU TO IS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF SO LIGHTLY AGAIN HE FELL BACK AND
THOUGHT TO HIMSELF 'WHAT WHAT WHO CAN THIS BE HE IS LEADING US TO
HE FELT FEARFUL AND WAS SILENT
DAY AFTER DAY THEY TRAVELED ON TILL
THEY CAME TO AN EXTENSIVE PLAIN ON THE BORDERS OF WHICH HUMAN BONES
WERE BLEACHING IN THE SUN
THE LEADER SPOKE 'THEY ARE THE BONES OF
THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE US
NONE HAS EVER YET RETURNED TO TELL THE
SAD TALE OF THEIR FATE AGAIN MUDJIKEWIS BECAME RESTLESS AND RUNNING
FORWARD GAVE THE ACCUSTOMED YELL
ADVANCING TO A LARGE ROCK WHICH STOOD
ABOVE THE GROUND HE STRUCK IT AND IT FELL TO PIECES
'SEE BROTHERS
SAID HE 'THUS WILL I TREAT THOSE WHOM WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT 'STILL
STILL ONCE MORE SAID THE LEADER 'HE TO WHOM I AM LEADING YOU IS NOT
TO BE COMPARED TO THE ROCK
MUDJIKEWIS FELL BACK THOUGHTFUL SAYING TO HIMSELF 'I WONDER WHO
THIS CAN BE THAT HE IS GOING TO ATTACK AND HE WAS AFRAID
STILL THEY
CONTINUED TO SEE THE REMAINS OF FORMER WARRIORS WHO HAD BEEN TO THE
PLACE WHERE THEY WERE NOW GOING SOME OF WHOM HAD RETREATED AS FAR BACK
AS THE PLACE WHERE THEY FIRST SAW THE BONES BEYOND WHICH NO ONE HAD
EVER ESCAPED
AT LAST THEY CAME TO A PIECE OF RISING GROUND FROM WHICH
THEY PLAINLY DISTINGUISHED SLEEPING ON A DISTANT MOUNTAIN A MAMMOTH
BEAR
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS VERY GREAT BUT THE SIZE OF THE ANIMAL
CAUSED HIM TO BE PLAINLY SEEN
'THERE SAID THE LEADER 'IT IS HE TO
WHOM I AM LEADING YOU HERE OUR TROUBLES WILL COMMENCE FOR HE IS A
MISHEMOKWA AND A MANITO
IT IS HE WHO HAS THAT WE PRIZE SO DEARLY I E
WAMPUM TO OBTAIN WHICH THE WARRIORS WHOSE BONES WE SAW SACRIFICED
THEIR LIVES
YOU MUST NOT BE FEARFUL BE MANLY
WE SHALL FIND HIM
ASLEEP THEN THE LEADER WENT FORWARD AND TOUCHED THE BELT AROUND THE
ANIMAL'S NECK
'THIS SAID HE 'IS WHAT WE MUST GET
IT CONTAINS THE
WAMPUM THEN THEY REQUESTED THE ELDEST TO TRY AND SLIP THE BELT OVER
THE BEAR'S HEAD WHO APPEARED TO BE FAST ASLEEP AS HE WAS NOT IN THE
LEAST DISTURBED BY THE ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN THE BELT
ALL THEIR EFFORTS
WERE IN VAIN TILL IT CAME TO THE ONE NEXT THE YOUNGEST
HE TRIED AND
THE BELT MOVED NEARLY OVER THE MONSTER'S HEAD BUT HE COULD GET IT NO
FARTHER
THEN THE YOUNGEST ONE AND THE LEADER MADE HIS ATTEMPT AND
SUCCEEDED
PLACING IT ON THE BACK OF THE OLDEST HE SAID 'NOW WE MUST
RUN AND OFF THEY STARTED
WHEN ONE BECAME FATIGUED WITH ITS WEIGHT
ANOTHER WOULD RELIEVE HIM
THUS THEY RAN TILL THEY HAD PASSED THE BONES
OF ALL FORMER WARRIORS AND WERE SOME DISTANCE BEYOND WHEN LOOKING
BACK THEY SAW THE MONSTER SLOWLY RISING
HE STOOD SOME TIME BEFORE HE
MISSED HIS WAMPUM
SOON THEY HEARD HIS TREMENDOUS HOWL LIKE DISTANT
THUNDER SLOWLY FILLING ALL THE SKY AND THEN THEY HEARD HIM SPEAK AND
SAY 'WHO CAN IT BE THAT HAS DARED TO STEAL MY WAMPUM EARTH IS NOT
SO LARGE BUT THAT I CAN FIND THEM AND HE DESCENDED FROM THE HILL IN
PURSUIT
AS IF CONVULSED THE EARTH SHOOK WITH EVERY JUMP HE MADE
VERY
SOON HE APPROACHED THE PARTY
THEY HOWEVER KEPT THE BELT EXCHANGING
IT FROM ONE TO ANOTHER AND ENCOURAGING EACH OTHER BUT HE GAINED ON
THEM FAST
'BROTHERS SAID THE LEADER 'HAS NEVER ANY ONE OF YOU
WHEN FASTING DREAMED OF SOME FRIENDLY SPIRIT WHO WOULD AID YOU AS A
GUARDIAN A DEAD SILENCE FOLLOWED
'WELL SAID HE 'FASTING I DREAMED
OF BEING IN DANGER OF INSTANT DEATH WHEN I SAW A SMALL LODGE WITH
SMOKE CURLING FROM ITS TOP
AN OLD MAN LIVED IN IT AND I DREAMED HE
HELPED ME AND MAY IT BE VERIFIED SOON HE SAID RUNNING FORWARD AND
GIVING THE PECULIAR YELL AND A HOWL AS IF THE SOUNDS CAME FROM THE
DEPTHS OF HIS STOMACH AND WHAT IS CALLED CHECAUDUM
GETTING UPON A
PIECE OF RISING GROUND BEHOLD A LODGE WITH SMOKE CURLING FROM ITS
TOP APPEARED
THIS GAVE THEM ALL NEW STRENGTH AND THEY RAN FORWARD
AND ENTERED IT
THE LEADER SPOKE TO THE OLD MAN WHO SAT IN THE LODGE
SAYING 'NEMESHO HELP US WE CLAIM YOUR PROTECTION FOR THE GREAT BEAR
WILL KILL US 'SIT DOWN AND EAT MY GRANDCHILDREN SAID THE OLD MAN
'WHO IS A GREAT MANITO SAID HE
'THERE IS NONE BUT ME BUT LET ME
LOOK AND HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE LODGE WHEN LO AT A LITTLE
DISTANCE HE SAW THE ENRAGED ANIMAL COMING ON WITH SLOW BUT POWERFUL
LEAPS
HE CLOSED THE DOOR
'YES SAID HE 'HE IS INDEED A GREAT MANITO
MY GRANDCHILDREN YOU WILL BE THE CAUSE OF MY LOSING MY LIFE YOU ASKED
MY PROTECTION AND I GRANTED IT SO NOW COME WHAT MAY I WILL PROTECT
YOU
WHEN THE BEAR ARRIVES AT THE DOOR YOU MUST RUN OUT OF THE OTHER
DOOR OF THE LODGE THEN PUTTING HIS HAND TO THE SIDE OF THE LODGE WHERE
HE SAT HE BROUGHT OUT A BAG WHICH HE OPENED
TAKING OUT TWO SMALL
BLACK DOGS HE PLACED THEM BEFORE HIM
'THESE ARE THE ONES I USE WHEN I
FIGHT SAID HE AND HE COMMENCED PATTING WITH BOTH HANDS THE SIDES OF
ONE OF THEM AND HE BEGAN TO SWELL OUT SO THAT HE SOON FILLED THE LODGE
BY HIS BULK AND HE HAD GREAT STRONG TEETH
WHEN HE ATTAINED HIS FULL
SIZE HE GROWLED AND FROM THAT MOMENT AS FROM INSTINCT HE JUMPED OUT
AT THE DOOR AND MET THE BEAR WHO IN ANOTHER LEAP WOULD HAVE REACHED THE
LODGE
A TERRIBLE COMBAT ENSUED
THE SKIES RANG WITH THE HOWLS OF THE
FIERCE MONSTERS
THE REMAINING DOG SOON TOOK THE FIELD
THE BROTHERS
AT THE ONSET TOOK THE ADVICE OF THE OLD MAN AND ESCAPED THROUGH THE
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LODGE
THEY HAD NOT PROCEEDED FAR BEFORE THEY HEARD
THE DYING CRY OF ONE OF THE DOGS AND SOON AFTER OF THE OTHER
'WELL
SAID THE LEADER 'THE OLD MAN WILL SHARE THEIR FATE SO RUN HE WILL
SOON BE AFTER US THEY STARTED WITH FRESH VIGOR FOR THEY HAD RECEIVED
FOOD FROM THE OLD MAN BUT VERY SOON THE BEAR CAME IN SIGHT AND AGAIN
WAS FAST GAINING UPON THEM
AGAIN THE LEADER ASKED THE BROTHERS IF THEY
COULD DO NOTHING FOR THEIR SAFETY
ALL WERE SILENT
THE LEADER RUNNING
FORWARD DID AS BEFORE
'I DREAMED HE CRIED 'THAT BEING IN GREAT
TROUBLE AN OLD MAN HELPED ME WHO WAS A MANITO WE SHALL SOON SEE HIS
LODGE TAKING COURAGE THEY STILL WENT ON
AFTER GOING A SHORT DISTANCE
THEY SAW THE LODGE OF THE OLD MANITO
THEY ENTERED IMMEDIATELY AND
CLAIMED HIS PROTECTION TELLING HIM A MANITO WAS AFTER THEM
THE OLD
MAN SETTING MEAT BEFORE THEM SAID 'EAT WHO IS A MANITO THERE IS NO
MANITO BUT ME THERE IS NONE WHOM I FEAR AND THE EARTH TREMBLED AS
THE MONSTER ADVANCED
THE OLD MAN OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW HIM COMING
HE SHUT IT SLOWLY AND SAID 'YES MY GRANDCHILDREN YOU HAVE BROUGHT
TROUBLE UPON ME PROCURING HIS MEDICINE SACK HE TOOK OUT HIS SMALL
WAR CLUBS OF BLACK STONE AND TOLD THE YOUNG MEN TO RUN THROUGH THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE LODGE
AS HE HANDLED THE CLUBS THEY BECAME VERY
LARGE AND THE OLD MAN STEPPED OUT JUST AS THE BEAR REACHED THE DOOR
THEN STRIKING HIM WITH ONE OF THE CLUBS IT BROKE IN PIECES THE BEAR
STUMBLED
RENEWING THE ATTEMPT WITH THE OTHER WAR CLUB THAT ALSO WAS
BROKEN BUT THE BEAR FELL SENSELESS
EACH BLOW THE OLD MAN GAVE HIM
SOUNDED LIKE A CLAP OF THUNDER AND THE HOWLS OF THE BEAR RAN ALONG TILL
THEY FILLED THE HEAVENS
THE YOUNG MEN HAD NOW RUN SOME DISTANCE WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK
THEY
COULD SEE THAT THE BEAR WAS RECOVERING FROM THE BLOWS
FIRST HE MOVED
HIS PAWS AND SOON THEY SAW HIM RISE ON HIS FEET
THE OLD MAN SHARED
THE FATE OF THE FIRST FOR THEY NOW HEARD HIS CRIES AS HE WAS TORN IN
PIECES
AGAIN THE MONSTER WAS IN PURSUIT AND FAST OVERTAKING THEM
NOT
YET DISCOURAGED THE YOUNG MEN KEPT ON THEIR WAY BUT THE BEAR WAS NOW
SO CLOSE THAT THE LEADER ONCE MORE APPLIED TO HIS BROTHERS BUT THEY
COULD DO NOTHING
'WELL SAID HE 'MY DREAMS WILL SOON BE EXHAUSTED
AFTER THIS I HAVE BUT ONE MORE HE ADVANCED INVOKING HIS GUARDIAN
SPIRIT TO AID HIM
'ONCE SAID HE 'I DREAMED THAT BEING SORELY
PRESSED I CAME TO A LARGE LAKE ON THE SHORE OF WHICH WAS A CANOE
PARTLY OUT OF WATER HAVING TEN PADDLES ALL IN READINESS
DO NOT FEAR
HE CRIED 'WE SHALL SOON GET IT AND SO IT WAS EVEN AS HE HAD SAID
COMING TO THE LAKE THEY SAW THE CANOE WITH TEN PADDLES AND IMMEDIATELY
THEY EMBARKED
SCARCELY HAD THEY REACHED THE CENTER OF THE LAKE WHEN
THEY SAW THE BEAR ARRIVE AT ITS BORDERS
LIFTING HIMSELF ON HIS HIND
LEGS HE LOOKED ALL AROUND
THEN HE WADED INTO THE WATER THEN LOSING
HIS FOOTING HE TURNED BACK AND COMMENCED MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THE
LAKE
MEANTIME THE PARTY REMAINED STATIONARY IN THE CENTER TO WATCH HIS
MOVEMENTS
HE TRAVELED ALL AROUND TILL AT LAST HE CAME TO THE PLACE
FROM WHENCE HE STARTED
THEN HE COMMENCED DRINKING UP THE WATER AND
THEY SAW THE CURRENT FAST SETTING IN TOWARDS HIS OPEN MOUTH
THE LEADER
ENCOURAGED THEM TO PADDLE HARD FOR THE OPPOSITE SHORE
WHEN ONLY A SHORT
DISTANCE FROM LAND THE CURRENT HAD INCREASED SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE
DRAWN BACK BY IT AND ALL THEIR EFFORTS TO REACH IT WERE IN VAIN
THEN THE LEADER AGAIN SPOKE TELLING THEM TO MEET THEIR FATES MANFULLY
'NOW IS THE TIME MUDJIKEWIS SAID HE 'TO SHOW YOUR PROWESS
TAKE
COURAGE AND SIT AT THE BOW OF THE CANOE AND WHEN IT APPROACHES HIS
MOUTH TRY WHAT EFFECT YOUR CLUB WILL HAVE ON HIS HEAD HE OBEYED AND
STOOD READY TO GIVE THE BLOW WHILE THE LEADER WHO STEERED DIRECTED
THE CANOE FOR THE OPEN MOUTH OF THE MONSTER
RAPIDLY ADVANCING THEY WERE JUST ABOUT TO ENTER HIS MOUTH WHEN
MUDJIKEWIS STRUCK HIM A TREMENDOUS BLOW ON THE HEAD AND GAVE THE
SAW SAW QUAN
THE BEAR'S LIMBS DOUBLED UNDER HIM AND HE FELL STUNNED
BY THE BLOW
BUT BEFORE MUDJIKEWIS COULD RENEW IT THE MONSTER DISGORGED
ALL THE WATER HE HAD DRANK WITH A FORCE WHICH SENT THE CANOE WITH GREAT
VELOCITY TO THE OPPOSITE SHORE
INSTANTLY LEAVING THE CANOE AGAIN THEY
FLED AND ON THEY WENT TILL THEY WERE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED
THE EARTH
AGAIN SHOOK AND SOON THEY SAW THE MONSTER HARD AFTER THEM
THEIR
SPIRITS DROOPED AND THEY FELT DISCOURAGED
THE LEADER EXERTED HIMSELF
BY ACTIONS AND WORDS TO CHEER THEM UP AND ONCE MORE HE ASKED THEM IF
THEY THOUGHT OF NOTHING OR COULD DO NOTHING FOR THEIR RESCUE AND AS
BEFORE ALL WERE SILENT
'THEN HE SAID 'THIS IS THE LAST TIME I CAN
APPLY TO MY GUARDIAN SPIRIT
NOW IF WE DO NOT SUCCEED OUR FATES ARE
DECIDED HE RAN FORWARD INVOKING HIS SPIRIT WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS
AND GAVE THE YELL
'WE SHALL SOON ARRIVE SAID HE TO HIS BROTHERS 'AT
THE PLACE WHERE MY LAST GUARDIAN SPIRIT DWELLS
IN HIM I PLACE GREAT
CONFIDENCE
DO NOT DO NOT BE AFRAID OR YOUR LIMBS WILL BE FEAR BOUND
WE SHALL SOON REACH HIS LODGE
RUN RUN HE CRIED
RETURNING NOW TO IAMO HE HAD PASSED ALL THE TIME IN THE SAME CONDITION
WE HAD LEFT HIM THE HEAD DIRECTING HIS SISTER IN ORDER TO PROCURE
FOOD WHERE TO PLACE THE MAGIC ARROWS AND SPEAKING AT LONG INTERVALS
ONE DAY THE SISTER SAW THE EYES OF THE HEAD BRIGHTEN AS IF WITH
PLEASURE
AT LAST IT SPOKE
'OH SISTER IT SAID 'IN WHAT A PITIFUL
SITUATION YOU HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF PLACING ME SOON VERY SOON A
PARTY OF YOUNG MEN WILL ARRIVE AND APPLY TO ME FOR AID BUT ALAS HOW
CAN I GIVE WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE WITH SO MUCH PLEASURE NEVERTHELESS
TAKE TWO ARROWS AND PLACE THEM WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF
PLACING THE OTHERS AND HAVE MEAT PREPARED AND COOKED BEFORE THEY
ARRIVE
WHEN YOU HEAR THEM COMING AND CALLING ON MY NAME GO OUT AND
SAY ALAS IT IS LONG AGO THAT AN ACCIDENT BEFELL HIM
I WAS THE CAUSE
OF IT IF THEY STILL COME NEAR ASK THEM IN AND SET MEAT BEFORE THEM
AND NOW YOU MUST FOLLOW MY DIRECTIONS STRICTLY
WHEN THE BEAR IS NEAR
GO OUT AND MEET HIM
YOU WILL TAKE MY MEDICINE SACK BOWS AND ARROWS
AND MY HEAD
YOU MUST THEN UNTIE THE SACK AND SPREAD OUT BEFORE YOU MY
PAINTS OF ALL COLORS MY WAR EAGLE FEATHERS MY TUFTS OF DRIED HAIR
AND WHATEVER ELSE IT CONTAINS
AS THE BEAR APPROACHES YOU WILL TAKE
ALL THESE ARTICLES ONE BY ONE AND SAY TO HIM THIS IS MY DECEASED
BROTHER'S PAINT AND SO ON WITH ALL THE OTHER ARTICLES THROWING EACH
OF THEM AS FAR AS YOU CAN
THE VIRTUES CONTAINED IN THEM WILL CAUSE HIM
TO TOTTER AND TO COMPLETE HIS DESTRUCTION YOU WILL TAKE MY HEAD AND
THAT TOO YOU WILL CAST AS FAR OFF AS YOU CAN CRYING ALOUD SEE THIS
IS MY DECEASED BROTHER'S HEAD HE WILL THEN FALL SENSELESS
BY THIS
TIME THE YOUNG MEN WILL HAVE EATEN AND YOU WILL CALL THEM TO YOUR
ASSISTANCE
YOU MUST THEN CUT THE CARCASS INTO PIECES YES INTO SMALL
PIECES AND SCATTER THEM TO THE FOUR WINDS FOR UNLESS YOU DO THIS HE
WILL AGAIN REVIVE SHE PROMISED THAT ALL SHOULD BE DONE AS HE SAID
SHE HAD ONLY TIME TO PREPARE THE MEAT WHEN THE VOICE OF THE LEADER
WAS HEARD CALLING UPON IAMO FOR AID
THE WOMAN WENT OUT AND SAID AS HER
BROTHER HAD DIRECTED
BUT THE WAR PARTY BEING CLOSELY PURSUED CAME
UP TO THE LODGE
SHE INVITED THEM IN AND PLACED THE MEAT BEFORE THEM
WHILE THEY WERE EATING THEY HEARD THE BEAR APPROACHING
UNTYING THE
MEDICINE SACK AND TAKING THE HEAD SHE HAD ALL IN READINESS FOR HIS
APPROACH
WHEN HE CAME UP SHE DID AS SHE HAD BEEN TOLD AND BEFORE SHE
HAD EXPENDED THE PAINTS AND FEATHERS THE BEAR BEGAN TO TOTTER BUT
STILL ADVANCING CAME CLOSE TO THE WOMAN
SAYING AS SHE WAS COMMANDED
SHE THEN TOOK THE HEAD AND CAST IT AS FAR FROM HER AS SHE COULD
AS IT
ROLLED ALONG THE GROUND THE BLOOD EXCITED BY THE FEELINGS OF THE
HEAD IN THIS TERRIBLE SCENE GUSHED FROM THE NOSE AND MOUTH
THE BEAR
TOTTERING SOON FELL WITH A TREMENDOUS NOISE
THEN SHE CRIED FOR HELP
AND THE YOUNG MEN CAME RUSHING OUT HAVING PARTIALLY REGAINED THEIR
STRENGTH AND SPIRITS
MUDJIKEWIS STEPPING UP GAVE A YELL AND STRUCK HIM A BLOW UPON THE
HEAD
THIS HE REPEATED TILL IT SEEMED LIKE A MASS OF BRAINS WHILE THE
OTHERS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE CUT HIM INTO VERY SMALL PIECES WHICH THEY
THEN SCATTERED IN EVERY DIRECTION
WHILE THUS EMPLOYED HAPPENING TO
LOOK AROUND WHERE THEY HAD THROWN THE MEAT WONDERFUL TO BEHOLD THEY
SAW STARTING UP AND TURNING OFF IN EVERY DIRECTION SMALL BLACK BEARS
SUCH AS ARE SEEN AT THE PRESENT DAY
THE COUNTRY WAS SOON OVERSPREAD
WITH THESE BLACK ANIMALS
AND IT WAS FROM THIS MONSTER THAT THE PRESENT
RACE OF BEARS DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN
HAVING THUS OVERCOME THEIR PURSUER THEY RETURNED TO THE LODGE
IN THE
MEANTIME THE WOMAN GATHERING THE IMPLEMENTS SHE HAD USED AND THE
HEAD PLACED THEM AGAIN IN THE SACK
BUT THE HEAD DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN
PROBABLY FROM ITS GREAT EXERTION TO OVERCOME THE MONSTER
HAVING SPENT SO MUCH TIME AND TRAVERSED SO VAST A COUNTRY IN THEIR
FLIGHT THE YOUNG MEN GAVE UP THE IDEA OF EVER RETURNING TO THEIR OWN
COUNTRY AND GAME BEING PLENTY THEY DETERMINED TO REMAIN WHERE THEY
NOW WERE
ONE DAY THEY MOVED OFF SOME DISTANCE FROM THE LODGE FOR THE
PURPOSE OF HUNTING HAVING LEFT THE WAMPUM WITH THE WOMAN
THEY WERE
VERY SUCCESSFUL AND AMUSED THEMSELVES AS ALL YOUNG MEN DO WHEN ALONE
BY TALKING AND JESTING WITH EACH OTHER
ONE OF THEM SPOKE AND SAID 'WE
HAVE ALL THIS SPORT TO OURSELVES LET US GO AND ASK OUR SISTER IF SHE
WILL NOT LET US BRING THE HEAD TO THIS PLACE AS IT IS STILL ALIVE
IT
MAY BE PLEASED TO HEAR US TALK AND BE IN OUR COMPANY
IN THE MEANTIME
TAKE FOOD TO OUR SISTER THEY WENT AND REQUESTED THE HEAD
SHE TOLD
THEM TO TAKE IT AND THEY TOOK IT TO THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS AND TRIED
TO AMUSE IT BUT ONLY AT TIMES DID THEY SEE ITS EYES BEAM WITH PLEASURE
ONE DAY WHILE BUSY IN THEIR ENCAMPMENT THEY WERE UNEXPECTEDLY ATTACKED
BY UNKNOWN INDIANS
THE SKIRMISH WAS LONG CONTESTED AND BLOODY MANY OF
THEIR FOES WERE SLAIN BUT STILL THEY WERE THIRTY TO ONE
THE YOUNG MEN
FOUGHT DESPERATELY TILL THEY WERE ALL KILLED
THE ATTACKING PARTY THEN
RETREATED TO A HEIGHT OF GROUND TO MUSTER THEIR MEN AND TO COUNT THE
NUMBER OF MISSING AND SLAIN
ONE OF THEIR YOUNG MEN HAD STAYED AWAY
AND IN ENDEAVORING TO OVERTAKE THEM CAME TO THE PLACE WHERE THE HEAD
WAS HUNG UP
SEEING THAT ALONE RETAIN ANIMATION HE EYED IT FOR SOME
TIME WITH FEAR AND SURPRISE
HOWEVER HE TOOK IT DOWN AND OPENED THE
SACK AND WAS MUCH PLEASED TO SEE THE BEAUTIFUL FEATHERS ONE OF WHICH
HE PLACED ON HIS HEAD
STARTING OFF IT WAVED GRACEFULLY OVER HIM TILL HE REACHED HIS PARTY
WHEN HE THREW DOWN THE HEAD AND SACK AND TOLD THEM HOW HE HAD FOUND IT
AND THAT THE SACK WAS FULL OF PAINTS AND FEATHERS
THEY ALL LOOKED AT
THE HEAD AND MADE SPORT OF IT
NUMBERS OF THE YOUNG MEN TOOK THE PAINT
AND PAINTED THEMSELVES AND ONE OF THE PARTY TOOK THE HEAD BY THE HAIR
AND SAID
'LOOK YOU UGLY THING AND SEE YOUR PAINTS ON THE FACES OF WARRIORS
BUT THE FEATHERS WERE SO BEAUTIFUL THAT NUMBERS OF THEM ALSO PLACED
THEM ON THEIR HEADS
THEN AGAIN THEY USED ALL KINDS OF INDIGNITY TO THE
HEAD FOR WHICH THEY WERE IN TURN REPAID BY THE DEATH OF THOSE WHO
HAD USED THE FEATHERS
THEN THE CHIEF COMMANDED THEM TO THROW AWAY ALL
EXCEPT THE HEAD
'WE WILL SEE SAID HE 'WHEN WE GET HOME WHAT WE CAN
DO WITH IT
WE WILL TRY TO MAKE IT SHUT ITS EYES
WHEN THEY REACHED THEIR HOMES THEY TOOK IT TO THE COUNCIL LODGE AND
HUNG IT UP BEFORE THE FIRE FASTENING IT WITH RAW HIDE SOAKED WHICH
WOULD SHRINK AND BECOME TIGHTENED BY THE ACTION OF THE FIRE
'WE WILL
THEN SEE THEY SAID 'IF WE CANNOT MAKE IT SHUT ITS EYES
MEANTIME FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE SISTER HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THE YOUNG
MEN TO BRING BACK THE HEAD TILL AT LAST GETTING IMPATIENT SHE WENT
IN SEARCH OF IT
THE YOUNG MEN SHE FOUND LYING WITHIN SHORT DISTANCES
OF EACH OTHER DEAD AND COVERED WITH WOUNDS
VARIOUS OTHER BODIES LAY
SCATTERED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AROUND THEM
SHE SEARCHED FOR THE HEAD
AND SACK BUT THEY WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
SHE RAISED HER VOICE AND
WEPT AND BLACKENED HER FACE
THEN SHE WALKED IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
TILL SHE CAME TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE THE HEAD HAD BEEN TAKEN
THEN SHE
FOUND THE MAGIC BOW AND ARROWS WHERE THE YOUNG MEN IGNORANT OF THEIR
QUALITIES HAD LEFT THEM
SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT SHE WOULD FIND HER
BROTHER'S HEAD AND CAME TO A PIECE OF RISING GROUND AND THERE SAW SOME
OF HIS PAINTS AND FEATHERS
THESE SHE CAREFULLY PUT UP AND HUNG UPON
THE BRANCH OF A TREE TILL HER RETURN
AT DUSK SHE ARRIVED AT THE FIRST LODGE OF A VERY EXTENSIVE VILLAGE
HERE
SHE USED A CHARM COMMON AMONG INDIANS WHEN THEY WISH TO MEET WITH A
KIND RECEPTION
ON APPLYING TO THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN OF THE LODGE SHE
WAS KINDLY RECEIVED
SHE MADE KNOWN HER ERRAND
THE OLD MAN PROMISED TO
AID HER AND TOLD HER THE HEAD WAS HUNG UP BEFORE THE COUNCIL FIRE AND
THAT THE CHIEFS OF THE VILLAGE WITH THEIR YOUNG MEN KEPT WATCH OVER
IT CONTINUALLY
THE FORMER ARE CONSIDERED AS MANITOES
SHE SAID SHE ONLY
WISHED TO SEE IT AND WOULD BE SATISFIED IF SHE COULD ONLY GET TO THE
DOOR OF THE LODGE
SHE KNEW SHE HAD NOT SUFFICIENT POWER TO TAKE IT BY
FORCE
'COME WITH ME SAID THE INDIAN 'I WILL TAKE YOU THERE THEY
WENT AND THEY TOOK THEIR SEATS NEAR THE DOOR
THE COUNCIL LODGE WAS
FILLED WITH WARRIORS AMUSING THEMSELVES WITH GAMES AND CONSTANTLY
KEEPING UP A FIRE TO SMOKE THE HEAD AS THEY SAID TO MAKE DRY MEAT
THEY SAW THE HEAD MOVE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO MAKE OF IT ONE SPOKE
AND SAID 'HA HA IT IS BEGINNING TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE SMOKE
THE SISTER LOOKED UP FROM THE DOOR AND HER EYES MET THOSE OF HER
BROTHER AND TEARS ROLLED DOWN THE CHEEKS OF THE HEAD
'WELL SAID THE
CHIEF 'I THOUGHT WE WOULD MAKE YOU DO SOMETHING AT LAST
LOOK LOOK AT
IT SHEDDING TEARS SAID HE TO THOSE AROUND HIM AND THEY ALL LAUGHED
AND PASSED THEIR JOKES UPON IT
THE CHIEF LOOKING AROUND AND OBSERVING
THE WOMAN AFTER SOME TIME SAID TO THE MAN WHO CAME WITH HER 'WHO HAVE
YOU GOT THERE I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT WOMAN BEFORE IN OUR VILLAGE
'YES REPLIED THE MAN 'YOU HAVE SEEN HER SHE IS A RELATION OF MINE
AND SELDOM GOES OUT
SHE STAYS AT MY LODGE AND ASKED ME TO ALLOW HER TO
COME WITH ME TO THIS PLACE IN THE CENTER OF THE LODGE SAT ONE OF THOSE
YOUNG MEN WHO ARE ALWAYS FORWARD AND FOND OF BOASTING AND DISPLAYING
THEMSELVES BEFORE OTHERS
'WHY SAID HE 'I HAVE SEEN HER OFTEN AND IT
IS TO THIS LODGE I GO ALMOST EVERY NIGHT TO COURT HER ALL THE OTHERS
LAUGHED AND CONTINUED THEIR GAMES
THE YOUNG MAN DID NOT KNOW HE WAS
TELLING A LIE TO THE WOMAN'S ADVANTAGE WHO BY THAT MEANS ESCAPED
SHE RETURNED TO THE MAN'S LODGE AND IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR HER OWN
COUNTRY
COMING TO THE SPOT WHERE THE BODIES OF HER ADOPTED BROTHERS
LAY SHE PLACED THEM TOGETHER THEIR FEET TOWARD THE EAST
THEN TAKING
AN AX WHICH SHE HAD SHE CAST IT UP INTO THE AIR CRYING OUT 'BROTHERS
GET UP FROM UNDER IT OR IT WILL FALL ON YOU THIS SHE REPEATED THREE
TIMES AND THE THIRD TIME THE BROTHERS ALL AROSE AND STOOD ON THEIR
FEET
MUDJIKEWIS COMMENCED RUBBING HIS EYES AND STRETCHING HIMSELF
'WHY
SAID HE 'I HAVE OVERSLEPT MYSELF 'NO INDEED SAID ONE OF THE
OTHERS 'DO YOU NOT KNOW WE WERE ALL KILLED AND THAT IT IS OUR SISTER
WHO HAS BROUGHT US TO LIFE THE YOUNG MEN TOOK THE BODIES OF THEIR
ENEMIES AND BURNED THEM
SOON AFTER THE WOMAN WENT TO PROCURE WIVES FOR
THEM IN A DISTANT COUNTRY THEY KNEW NOT WHERE BUT SHE RETURNED WITH
TEN YOUNG WOMEN WHICH SHE GAVE TO THE TEN YOUNG MEN BEGINNING WITH THE
ELDEST
MUDJIKEWIS STEPPED TO AND FRO UNEASY LEST HE SHOULD NOT GET THE
ONE HE LIKED
BUT HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED FOR SHE FELL TO HIS LOT
AND
THEY WERE WELL MATCHED FOR SHE WAS A FEMALE MAGICIAN
THEY THEN ALL
MOVED INTO A VERY LARGE LODGE AND THEIR SISTER TOLD THEM THAT THE WOMEN
MUST NOW TAKE TURNS IN GOING TO HER BROTHER'S HEAD EVERY NIGHT TRYING
TO UNTIE IT
THEY ALL SAID THEY WOULD DO SO WITH PLEASURE
THE ELDEST
MADE THE FIRST ATTEMPT AND WITH A RUSHING NOISE SHE FLED THROUGH THE
AIR
TOWARD DAYLIGHT SHE RETURNED
SHE HAD BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AS SHE
SUCCEEDED IN UNTYING ONLY ONE OF THE KNOTS
ALL TOOK THEIR TURNS
REGULARLY AND EACH ONE SUCCEEDED IN UNTYING ONLY ONE KNOT EACH TIME
BUT WHEN THE YOUNGEST WENT SHE COMMENCED THE WORK AS SOON AS SHE
REACHED THE LODGE ALTHOUGH IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN OCCUPIED STILL THE
INDIANS NEVER COULD SEE ANY ONE
FOR TEN NIGHTS NOW THE SMOKE HAD NOT
ASCENDED BUT FILLED THE LODGE AND DROVE THEM OUT
THIS LAST NIGHT THEY
WERE ALL DRIVEN OUT AND THE YOUNG WOMAN CARRIED OFF THE HEAD
THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE SISTER HEARD THE YOUNG WOMAN COMING HIGH
THROUGH THE AIR AND THEY HEARD HER SAYING 'PREPARE THE BODY OF OUR
BROTHER AND AS SOON AS THEY HEARD IT THEY WENT TO A SMALL LODGE WHERE
THE BLACK BODY OF IAMO LAY
HIS SISTER COMMENCED CUTTING THE NECK PART
FROM WHICH THE NECK HAD BEEN SEVERED
SHE CUT SO DEEP AS TO CAUSE IT TO
BLEED AND THE OTHERS WHO WERE PRESENT BY RUBBING THE BODY AND APPLYING
MEDICINES EXPELLED THE BLACKNESS
IN THE MEANTIME THE ONE WHO BROUGHT
IT BY CUTTING THE NECK OF THE HEAD CAUSED THAT ALSO TO BLEED
AS SOON AS SHE ARRIVED THEY PLACED THAT CLOSE TO THE BODY AND BY AID
OF MEDICINES AND VARIOUS OTHER MEANS SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING IAMO TO ALL
HIS FORMER BEAUTY AND MANLINESS
ALL REJOICED IN THE HAPPY TERMINATION
OF THEIR TROUBLES AND THEY HAD SPENT SOME TIME JOYFULLY TOGETHER WHEN
IAMO SAID 'NOW I WILL DIVIDE THE WAMPUM AND GETTING THE BELT WHICH
CONTAINED IT HE COMMENCED WITH THE ELDEST GIVING IT IN EQUAL PORTIONS
BUT THE YOUNGEST GOT THE MOST SPLENDID AND BEAUTIFUL AS THE BOTTOM OF
THE BELT HELD THE RICHEST AND RAREST
THEY WERE TOLD THAT SINCE THEY HAD ALL ONCE DIED AND WERE RESTORED TO
LIFE THEY WERE NO LONGER MORTAL BUT SPIRITS AND THEY WERE ASSIGNED
DIFFERENT STATIONS IN THE INVISIBLE WORLD
ONLY MUDJIKEWIS'S PLACE WAS
HOWEVER NAMED
HE WAS TO DIRECT THE WEST WIND HENCE GENERALLY CALLED
KEBEYUN THERE TO REMAIN FOR EVER
THEY WERE COMMANDED AS THEY HAD
IT IN THEIR POWER TO DO GOOD TO THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH AND
FORGETTING THEIR SUFFERINGS IN PROCURING THE WAMPUM TO GIVE ALL THINGS
WITH A LIBERAL HAND
AND THEY WERE ALSO COMMANDED THAT IT SHOULD ALSO
BE HELD BY THEM SACRED THOSE GRAINS OR SHELLS OF THE PALE HUE TO BE
EMBLEMATIC OF PEACE WHILE THOSE OF THE DARKER HUE WOULD LEAD TO EVIL
AND WAR
THE SPIRITS THEN AMID SONGS AND SHOUTS TOOK THEIR FLIGHT TO THEIR
RESPECTIVE ABODES ON HIGH WHILE IAMO WITH HIS SISTER IAMOQUA
DESCENDED INTO THE DEPTHS BELOW

PREFATORY
THIS BOOK IS MERELY A PERSONAL NARRATIVE AND NOT A PRETENTIOUS HISTORY
OR A PHILOSOPHICAL DISSERTATION
IT IS A RECORD OF SEVERAL YEARS OF
VARIEGATED VAGABONDIZING AND ITS OBJECT IS RATHER TO HELP THE RESTING
READER WHILE AWAY AN IDLE HOUR THAN AFFLICT HIM WITH METAPHYSICS OR GOAD
HIM WITH SCIENCE
STILL THERE IS INFORMATION IN THE VOLUME INFORMATION
CONCERNING AN INTERESTING EPISODE IN THE HISTORY OF THE FAR WEST ABOUT
WHICH NO BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY PERSONS WHO WERE ON THE GROUND IN
PERSON AND SAW THE HAPPENINGS OF THE TIME WITH THEIR OWN EYES
I ALLUDE
TO THE RISE GROWTH AND CULMINATION OF THE SILVER MINING FEVER IN NEVADA
A CURIOUS EPISODE IN SOME RESPECTS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS PECULIAR KIND
THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE LAND AND THE ONLY ONE INDEED THAT IS LIKELY
TO OCCUR IN IT
YES TAKE IT ALL AROUND THERE IS QUITE A GOOD DEAL OF INFORMATION IN THE
BOOK
I REGRET THIS VERY MUCH BUT REALLY IT COULD NOT BE HELPED
INFORMATION APPEARS TO STEW OUT OF ME NATURALLY LIKE THE PRECIOUS OTTAR
OF ROSES OUT OF THE OTTER
SOMETIMES IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT I WOULD
GIVE WORLDS IF I COULD RETAIN MY FACTS BUT IT CANNOT BE
THE MORE I CALK
UP THE SOURCES AND THE TIGHTER I GET THE MORE I LEAK WISDOM

A BRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY
B THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE
C CONCERNING A FRIGHTFUL ASSASSINATION THAT WAS NEVER CONSUMMATED
CHAPTER I
MY BROTHER HAD JUST BEEN APPOINTED SECRETARY OF NEVADA TERRITORY AN
OFFICE OF SUCH MAJESTY THAT IT CONCENTRATED IN ITSELF THE DUTIES AND
DIGNITIES OF TREASURER COMPTROLLER SECRETARY OF STATE AND ACTING
GOVERNOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S ABSENCE
A SALARY OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
A YEAR AND THE TITLE OF MR
SECRETARY GAVE TO THE GREAT POSITION AN
AIR OF WILD AND IMPOSING GRANDEUR
I WAS YOUNG AND IGNORANT AND I
ENVIED MY BROTHER
I COVETED HIS DISTINCTION AND HIS FINANCIAL SPLENDOR
BUT PARTICULARLY AND ESPECIALLY THE LONG STRANGE JOURNEY HE WAS GOING TO
MAKE AND THE CURIOUS NEW WORLD HE WAS GOING TO EXPLORE
HE WAS GOING TO
TRAVEL I NEVER HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME AND THAT WORD TRAVEL HAD A
SEDUCTIVE CHARM FOR ME
PRETTY SOON HE WOULD BE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
MILES AWAY ON THE GREAT PLAINS AND DESERTS AND AMONG THE MOUNTAINS OF
THE FAR WEST AND WOULD SEE BUFFALOES AND INDIANS AND PRAIRIE DOGS AND
ANTELOPES AND HAVE ALL KINDS OF ADVENTURES AND MAY BE GET HANGED OR
SCALPED AND HAVE EVER SUCH A FINE TIME AND WRITE HOME AND TELL US ALL
ABOUT IT AND BE A HERO
AND HE WOULD SEE THE GOLD MINES AND THE SILVER
MINES AND MAYBE GO ABOUT OF AN AFTERNOON WHEN HIS WORK WAS DONE AND
PICK UP TWO OR THREE PAILFULS OF SHINING SLUGS AND NUGGETS OF GOLD AND
SILVER ON THE HILLSIDE
AND BY AND BY HE WOULD BECOME VERY RICH AND
RETURN HOME BY SEA AND BE ABLE TO TALK AS CALMLY ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO AND
THE OCEAN AND THE ISTHMUS AS IF IT WAS NOTHING OF ANY CONSEQUENCE TO
HAVE SEEN THOSE MARVELS FACE TO FACE
WHAT I SUFFERED IN CONTEMPLATING
HIS HAPPINESS PEN CANNOT DESCRIBE
AND SO WHEN HE OFFERED ME IN COLD
BLOOD THE SUBLIME POSITION OF PRIVATE SECRETARY UNDER HIM IT APPEARED
TO ME THAT THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH PASSED AWAY AND THE FIRMAMENT WAS
ROLLED TOGETHER AS A SCROLL I HAD NOTHING MORE TO DESIRE
MY
CONTENTMENT WAS COMPLETE
AT THE END OF AN HOUR OR TWO I WAS READY FOR THE JOURNEY
NOT MUCH
PACKING UP WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE WE WERE GOING IN THE OVERLAND STAGE
FROM THE MISSOURI FRONTIER TO NEVADA AND PASSENGERS WERE ONLY ALLOWED A
SMALL QUANTITY OF BAGGAGE APIECE
THERE WAS NO PACIFIC RAILROAD IN THOSE
FINE TIMES OF TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AGO NOT A SINGLE RAIL OF IT
I ONLY PROPOSED TO STAY IN NEVADA THREE MONTHS I HAD NO THOUGHT OF
STAYING LONGER THAN THAT
I MEANT TO SEE ALL I COULD THAT WAS NEW AND
STRANGE AND THEN HURRY HOME TO BUSINESS
I LITTLE THOUGHT THAT I WOULD
NOT SEE THE END OF THAT THREE MONTH PLEASURE EXCURSION FOR SIX OR SEVEN
UNCOMMONLY LONG YEARS
I DREAMED ALL NIGHT ABOUT INDIANS DESERTS AND SILVER BARS AND IN DUE
TIME NEXT DAY WE TOOK SHIPPING AT THE ST
LOUIS WHARF ON BOARD A
STEAMBOAT BOUND UP THE MISSOURI RIVER
WE WERE SIX DAYS GOING FROM ST
LOUIS TO ST
JO A TRIP THAT WAS SO
DULL AND SLEEPY AND EVENTLESS THAT IT HAS LEFT NO MORE IMPRESSION ON MY
MEMORY THAN IF ITS DURATION HAD BEEN SIX MINUTES INSTEAD OF THAT MANY
DAYS
NO RECORD IS LEFT IN MY MIND NOW CONCERNING IT BUT A CONFUSED
JUMBLE OF SAVAGE LOOKING SNAGS WHICH WE DELIBERATELY WALKED OVER WITH
ONE WHEEL OR THE OTHER AND OF REEFS WHICH WE BUTTED AND BUTTED AND THEN
RETIRED FROM AND CLIMBED OVER IN SOME SOFTER PLACE AND OF SAND BARS
WHICH WE ROOSTED ON OCCASIONALLY AND RESTED AND THEN GOT OUT OUR
CRUTCHES AND SPARRED OVER
IN FACT THE BOAT MIGHT ALMOST AS WELL HAVE GONE TO ST
JO
BY LAND FOR
SHE WAS WALKING MOST OF THE TIME ANYHOW CLIMBING OVER REEFS AND
CLAMBERING OVER SNAGS PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY ALL DAY LONG
THE
CAPTAIN SAID SHE WAS A BULLY BOAT AND ALL SHE WANTED WAS MORE SHEAR
AND A BIGGER WHEEL
I THOUGHT SHE WANTED A PAIR OF STILTS BUT I HAD THE
DEEP SAGACITY NOT TO SAY SO
CHAPTER II
THE FIRST THING WE DID ON THAT GLAD EVENING THAT LANDED US AT ST
JOSEPH
WAS TO HUNT UP THE STAGE OFFICE AND PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS
APIECE FOR TICKETS PER OVERLAND COACH TO CARSON CITY NEVADA
THE NEXT MORNING BRIGHT AND EARLY WE TOOK A HASTY BREAKFAST AND
HURRIED TO THE STARTING PLACE
THEN AN INCONVENIENCE PRESENTED ITSELF
WHICH WE HAD NOT PROPERLY APPRECIATED BEFORE NAMELY THAT ONE CANNOT
MAKE A HEAVY TRAVELING TRUNK STAND FOR TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OF BAGGAGE
BECAUSE IT WEIGHS A GOOD DEAL MORE
BUT THAT WAS ALL WE COULD TAKE
TWENTY FIVE POUNDS EACH
SO WE HAD TO SNATCH OUR TRUNKS OPEN AND MAKE A
SELECTION IN A GOOD DEAL OF A HURRY
WE PUT OUR LAWFUL TWENTY FIVE
POUNDS APIECE ALL IN ONE VALISE AND SHIPPED THE TRUNKS BACK TO ST
LOUIS
AGAIN
IT WAS A SAD PARTING FOR NOW WE HAD NO SWALLOW TAIL COATS AND
WHITE KID GLOVES TO WEAR AT PAWNEE RECEPTIONS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND
NO STOVE PIPE HATS NOR PATENT LEATHER BOOTS NOR ANYTHING ELSE NECESSARY
TO MAKE LIFE CALM AND PEACEFUL
WE WERE REDUCED TO A WAR FOOTING
EACH
OF US PUT ON A ROUGH HEAVY SUIT OF CLOTHING WOOLEN ARMY SHIRT AND
STOGY BOOTS INCLUDED AND INTO THE VALISE WE CROWDED A FEW WHITE
SHIRTS SOME UNDER CLOTHING AND SUCH THINGS
MY BROTHER THE SECRETARY
TOOK ALONG ABOUT FOUR POUNDS OF UNITED STATES STATUTES AND SIX POUNDS OF
UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY FOR WE DID NOT KNOW POOR INNOCENTS THAT SUCH
THINGS COULD BE BOUGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO ON ONE DAY AND RECEIVED IN CARSON
CITY THE NEXT
I WAS ARMED TO THE TEETH WITH A PITIFUL LITTLE SMITH
WESSON'S SEVEN SHOOTER WHICH CARRIED A BALL LIKE A HOMOEOPATHIC PILL
AND IT TOOK THE WHOLE SEVEN TO MAKE A DOSE FOR AN ADULT
BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS GRAND
IT APPEARED TO ME TO BE A DANGEROUS WEAPON
IT ONLY HAD
ONE FAULT YOU COULD NOT HIT ANYTHING WITH IT
ONE OF OUR CONDUCTORS
PRACTICED AWHILE ON A COW WITH IT AND AS LONG AS SHE STOOD STILL AND
BEHAVED HERSELF SHE WAS SAFE BUT AS SOON AS SHE WENT TO MOVING ABOUT
AND HE GOT TO SHOOTING AT OTHER THINGS SHE CAME TO GRIEF
THE SECRETARY
HAD A SMALL SIZED COLT'S REVOLVER STRAPPED AROUND HIM FOR PROTECTION
AGAINST THE INDIANS AND TO GUARD AGAINST ACCIDENTS HE CARRIED IT
UNCAPPED
MR
GEORGE BEMIS WAS DISMALLY FORMIDABLE
GEORGE BEMIS WAS
OUR FELLOW TRAVELER
WE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE
HE WORE IN HIS BELT AN OLD ORIGINAL
ALLEN REVOLVER SUCH AS IRREVERENT PEOPLE CALLED A PEPPER BOX SIMPLY
DRAWING THE TRIGGER BACK COCKED AND FIRED THE PISTOL
AS THE TRIGGER
CAME BACK THE HAMMER WOULD BEGIN TO RISE AND THE BARREL TO TURN OVER
AND PRESENTLY DOWN WOULD DROP THE HAMMER AND AWAY WOULD SPEED THE BALL
TO AIM ALONG THE TURNING BARREL AND HIT THE THING AIMED AT WAS A FEAT
WHICH WAS PROBABLY NEVER DONE WITH AN ALLEN IN THE WORLD
BUT GEORGE'S
WAS A RELIABLE WEAPON NEVERTHELESS BECAUSE AS ONE OF THE STAGE DRIVERS
AFTERWARD SAID IF SHE DIDN'T GET WHAT SHE WENT AFTER SHE WOULD FETCH
SOMETHING ELSE AND SO SHE DID
SHE WENT AFTER A DEUCE OF SPADES NAILED
AGAINST A TREE ONCE AND FETCHED A MULE STANDING ABOUT THIRTY YARDS TO
THE LEFT OF IT
BEMIS DID NOT WANT THE MULE BUT THE OWNER CAME OUT WITH
A DOUBLE BARRELED SHOTGUN AND PERSUADED HIM TO BUY IT ANYHOW
IT WAS A
CHEERFUL WEAPON THE ALLEN SOMETIMES ALL ITS SIX BARRELS WOULD GO OFF
AT ONCE AND THEN THERE WAS NO SAFE PLACE IN ALL THE REGION ROUND ABOUT
BUT BEHIND IT
WE TOOK TWO OR THREE BLANKETS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST FROSTY WEATHER IN
THE MOUNTAINS
IN THE MATTER OF LUXURIES WE WERE MODEST WE TOOK NONE
ALONG BUT SOME PIPES AND FIVE POUNDS OF SMOKING TOBACCO
WE HAD TWO
LARGE CANTEENS TO CARRY WATER IN BETWEEN STATIONS ON THE PLAINS AND WE
ALSO TOOK WITH US A LITTLE SHOT BAG OF SILVER COIN FOR DAILY EXPENSES IN
THE WAY OF BREAKFASTS AND DINNERS
BY EIGHT O'CLOCK EVERYTHING WAS READY AND WE WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE RIVER
WE JUMPED INTO THE STAGE THE DRIVER CRACKED HIS WHIP AND WE
BOWLED AWAY AND LEFT THE STATES BEHIND US
IT WAS A SUPERB SUMMER
MORNING AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE WAS BRILLIANT WITH SUNSHINE
THERE WAS A
FRESHNESS AND BREEZINESS TOO AND AN EXHILARATING SENSE OF EMANCIPATION
FROM ALL SORTS OF CARES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ALMOST MADE US FEEL
THAT THE YEARS WE HAD SPENT IN THE CLOSE HOT CITY TOILING AND SLAVING
HAD BEEN WASTED AND THROWN AWAY
WE WERE SPINNING ALONG THROUGH KANSAS
AND IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR AND A HALF WE WERE FAIRLY ABROAD ON THE
GREAT PLAINS
JUST HERE THE LAND WAS ROLLING A GRAND SWEEP OF REGULAR
ELEVATIONS AND DEPRESSIONS AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH LIKE THE
STATELY HEAVE AND SWELL OF THE OCEAN'S BOSOM AFTER A STORM
AND
EVERYWHERE WERE CORNFIELDS ACCENTING WITH SQUARES OF DEEPER GREEN THIS
LIMITLESS EXPANSE OF GRASSY LAND
BUT PRESENTLY THIS SEA UPON DRY GROUND
WAS TO LOSE ITS ROLLING CHARACTER AND STRETCH AWAY FOR SEVEN HUNDRED
MILES AS LEVEL AS A FLOOR
OUR COACH WAS A GREAT SWINGING AND SWAYING STAGE OF THE MOST SUMPTUOUS
DESCRIPTION AN IMPOSING CRADLE ON WHEELS
IT WAS DRAWN BY SIX HANDSOME
HORSES AND BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER SAT THE CONDUCTOR THE LEGITIMATE
CAPTAIN OF THE CRAFT FOR IT WAS HIS BUSINESS TO TAKE CHARGE AND CARE OF
THE MAILS BAGGAGE EXPRESS MATTER AND PASSENGERS
WE THREE WERE THE
ONLY PASSENGERS THIS TRIP
WE SAT ON THE BACK SEAT INSIDE
ABOUT ALL
THE REST OF THE COACH WAS FULL OF MAIL BAGS FOR WE HAD THREE DAYS'
DELAYED MAILS WITH US
ALMOST TOUCHING OUR KNEES A PERPENDICULAR WALL
OF MAIL MATTER ROSE UP TO THE ROOF
THERE WAS A GREAT PILE OF IT
STRAPPED ON TOP OF THE STAGE AND BOTH THE FORE AND HIND BOOTS WERE FULL
WE HAD TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF IT ABOARD THE DRIVER SAID A
LITTLE FOR BRIGHAM AND CARSON AND 'FRISCO BUT THE HEFT OF IT FOR THE
INJUNS WHICH IS POWERFUL TROUBLESOME 'THOUT THEY GET PLENTY OF TRUCK TO
READ BUT AS HE JUST THEN GOT UP A FEARFUL CONVULSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE
WHICH WAS SUGGESTIVE OF A WINK BEING SWALLOWED BY AN EARTHQUAKE WE
GUESSED THAT HIS REMARK WAS INTENDED TO BE FACETIOUS AND TO MEAN THAT WE
WOULD UNLOAD THE MOST OF OUR MAIL MATTER SOMEWHERE ON THE PLAINS AND
LEAVE IT TO THE INDIANS OR WHOSOEVER WANTED IT
WE CHANGED HORSES EVERY TEN MILES ALL DAY LONG AND FAIRLY FLEW OVER THE
HARD LEVEL ROAD
WE JUMPED OUT AND STRETCHED OUR LEGS EVERY TIME THE
COACH STOPPED AND SO THE NIGHT FOUND US STILL VIVACIOUS AND UNFATIGUED
AFTER SUPPER A WOMAN GOT IN WHO LIVED ABOUT FIFTY MILES FURTHER ON AND
WE THREE HAD TO TAKE TURNS AT SITTING OUTSIDE WITH THE DRIVER AND
CONDUCTOR
APPARENTLY SHE WAS NOT A TALKATIVE WOMAN
SHE WOULD SIT
THERE IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT AND FASTEN HER STEADFAST EYES ON A
MOSQUITO ROOTING INTO HER ARM AND SLOWLY SHE WOULD RAISE HER OTHER HAND
TILL SHE HAD GOT HIS RANGE AND THEN SHE WOULD LAUNCH A SLAP AT HIM THAT
WOULD HAVE JOLTED A COW AND AFTER THAT SHE WOULD SIT AND CONTEMPLATE THE
CORPSE WITH TRANQUIL SATISFACTION FOR SHE NEVER MISSED HER MOSQUITO SHE
WAS A DEAD SHOT AT SHORT RANGE
SHE NEVER REMOVED A CARCASE BUT LEFT
THEM THERE FOR BAIT
I SAT BY THIS GRIM SPHYNX AND WATCHED HER KILL
THIRTY OR FORTY MOSQUITOES WATCHED HER AND WAITED FOR HER TO SAY
SOMETHING BUT SHE NEVER DID
SO I FINALLY OPENED THE CONVERSATION
MYSELF
I SAID
THE MOSQUITOES ARE PRETTY BAD ABOUT HERE MADAM
YOU BET
WHAT DID I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY MADAM
YOU BET
THEN SHE CHEERED UP AND FACED AROUND AND SAID
DANGED IF I DIDN'T BEGIN TO THINK YOU FELLERS WAS DEEF AND DUMB
I DID
B'GOSH
HERE I'VE SOT AND SOT AND SOT A BUST'N MUSKEETERS AND
WONDERIN' WHAT WAS AILIN' YE
FUST I THOT YOU WAS DEEF AND DUMB THEN I
THOT YOU WAS SICK OR CRAZY OR SUTHIN' AND THEN BY AND BY I BEGIN TO
RECKON YOU WAS A PASSEL OF SICKLY FOOLS THAT COULDN'T THINK OF NOTHING TO
SAY
WHER'D YE COME FROM
THE SPHYNX WAS A SPHYNX NO MORE THE FOUNTAINS OF HER GREAT DEEP WERE
BROKEN UP AND SHE RAINED THE NINE PARTS OF SPEECH FORTY DAYS AND FORTY
NIGHTS METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING AND BURIED US UNDER A DESOLATING DELUGE
OF TRIVIAL GOSSIP THAT LEFT NOT A CRAG OR PINNACLE OF REJOINDER
PROJECTING ABOVE THE TOSSING WASTE OF DISLOCATED GRAMMAR AND DECOMPOSED
PRONUNCIATION
HOW WE SUFFERED SUFFERED SUFFERED SHE WENT ON HOUR AFTER HOUR TILL
I WAS SORRY I EVER OPENED THE MOSQUITO QUESTION AND GAVE HER A START
SHE NEVER DID STOP AGAIN UNTIL SHE GOT TO HER JOURNEY'S END TOWARD
DAYLIGHT AND THEN SHE STIRRED US UP AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE STAGE FOR WE
WERE NODDING BY THAT TIME AND SAID
NOW YOU GIT OUT AT COTTONWOOD YOU FELLERS AND LAY OVER A COUPLE O'
DAYS AND I'LL BE ALONG SOME TIME TO NIGHT AND IF I CAN DO YE ANY GOOD
BY EDGIN' IN A WORD NOW AND THEN I'M RIGHT THAR
FOLKS'LL TELL YOU'T
I'VE ALWAYS BEN KIND O' OFFISH AND PARTIC'LAR FOR A GAL THAT'S RAISED IN
THE WOODS AND I AM WITH THE RAG TAG AND BOB TAIL AND A GAL HAS TO BE
IF SHE WANTS TO BE ANYTHING BUT WHEN PEOPLE COMES ALONG WHICH IS MY
EQUALS I RECKON I'M A PRETTY SOCIABLE HEIFER AFTER ALL
WE RESOLVED NOT TO LAY BY AT COTTONWOOD
CHAPTER III
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE DAYLIGHT WE WERE BOWLING ALONG SMOOTHLY
OVER THE ROAD SO SMOOTHLY THAT OUR CRADLE ONLY ROCKED IN A GENTLE
LULLING WAY THAT WAS GRADUALLY SOOTHING US TO SLEEP AND DULLING OUR
CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN SOMETHING GAVE AWAY UNDER US WE WERE DIMLY AWARE OF
IT BUT INDIFFERENT TO IT
THE COACH STOPPED
WE HEARD THE DRIVER AND
CONDUCTOR TALKING TOGETHER OUTSIDE AND RUMMAGING FOR A LANTERN AND
SWEARING BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT FIND IT BUT WE HAD NO INTEREST IN
WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED AND IT ONLY ADDED TO OUR COMFORT TO THINK OF THOSE
PEOPLE OUT THERE AT WORK IN THE MURKY NIGHT AND WE SNUG IN OUR NEST WITH
THE CURTAINS DRAWN
BUT PRESENTLY BY THE SOUNDS THERE SEEMED TO BE AN
EXAMINATION GOING ON AND THEN THE DRIVER'S VOICE SAID
BY GEORGE THE THOROUGHBRACE IS BROKE
THIS STARTLED ME BROAD AWAKE AS AN UNDEFINED SENSE OF CALAMITY IS ALWAYS
APT TO DO
I SAID TO MYSELF NOW A THOROUGHBRACE IS PROBABLY PART OF A
HORSE AND DOUBTLESS A VITAL PART TOO FROM THE DISMAY IN THE DRIVER'S
VOICE
LEG MAYBE AND YET HOW COULD HE BREAK HIS LEG WALTZING ALONG
SUCH A ROAD AS THIS NO IT CAN'T BE HIS LEG
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
UNLESS HE WAS REACHING FOR THE DRIVER
NOW WHAT CAN BE THE
THOROUGHBRACE OF A HORSE I WONDER WELL WHATEVER COMES I SHALL NOT
AIR MY IGNORANCE IN THIS CROWD ANYWAY
JUST THEN THE CONDUCTOR'S FACE APPEARED AT A LIFTED CURTAIN AND HIS
LANTERN GLARED IN ON US AND OUR WALL OF MAIL MATTER
HE SAID
GENTS YOU'LL HAVE TO TURN OUT A SPELL
THOROUGHBRACE IS BROKE
WE CLIMBED OUT INTO A CHILL DRIZZLE AND FELT EVER SO HOMELESS AND
DREARY
WHEN I FOUND THAT THE THING THEY CALLED A THOROUGHBRACE WAS
THE MASSIVE COMBINATION OF BELTS AND SPRINGS WHICH THE COACH ROCKS ITSELF
IN I SAID TO THE DRIVER
I NEVER SAW A THOROUGHBRACE USED UP LIKE THAT BEFORE THAT I CAN
REMEMBER
HOW DID IT HAPPEN
WHY IT HAPPENED BY TRYING TO MAKE ONE COACH CARRY THREE DAYS' MAIL
THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED SAID HE
AND RIGHT HERE IS THE VERY DIRECTION
WHICH IS WROTE ON ALL THE NEWSPAPER BAGS WHICH WAS TO BE PUT OUT FOR THE
INJUNS FOR TO KEEP 'EM QUIET
IT'S MOST UNCOMMON LUCKY BECUZ IT'S SO
NATION DARK I SHOULD 'A' GONE BY UNBEKNOWNS IF THAT AIR THOROUGHBRACE
HADN'T BROKE
I KNEW THAT HE WAS IN LABOR WITH ANOTHER OF THOSE WINKS OF HIS THOUGH I
COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE BECAUSE HE WAS BENT DOWN AT WORK AND WISHING HIM
A SAFE DELIVERY I TURNED TO AND HELPED THE REST GET OUT THE MAIL SACKS
IT MADE A GREAT PYRAMID BY THE ROADSIDE WHEN IT WAS ALL OUT
WHEN THEY
HAD MENDED THE THOROUGHBRACE WE FILLED THE TWO BOOTS AGAIN BUT PUT NO
MAIL ON TOP AND ONLY HALF AS MUCH INSIDE AS THERE WAS BEFORE
THE
CONDUCTOR BENT ALL THE SEAT BACKS DOWN AND THEN FILLED THE COACH JUST
HALF FULL OF MAIL BAGS FROM END TO END
WE OBJECTED LOUDLY TO THIS FOR
IT LEFT US NO SEATS
BUT THE CONDUCTOR WAS WISER THAN WE AND SAID A BED
WAS BETTER THAN SEATS AND MOREOVER THIS PLAN WOULD PROTECT HIS
THOROUGHBRACES
WE NEVER WANTED ANY SEATS AFTER THAT
THE LAZY BED WAS
INFINITELY PREFERABLE
I HAD MANY AN EXCITING DAY SUBSEQUENTLY LYING
ON IT READING THE STATUTES AND THE DICTIONARY AND WONDERING HOW THE
CHARACTERS WOULD TURN OUT
THE CONDUCTOR SAID HE WOULD SEND BACK A GUARD FROM THE NEXT STATION TO
TAKE CHARGE OF THE ABANDONED MAIL BAGS AND WE DROVE ON
IT WAS NOW JUST DAWN AND AS WE STRETCHED OUR CRAMPED LEGS FULL LENGTH ON
THE MAIL SACKS AND GAZED OUT THROUGH THE WINDOWS ACROSS THE WIDE WASTES
OF GREENSWARD CLAD IN COOL POWDERY MIST TO WHERE THERE WAS AN EXPECTANT
LOOK IN THE EASTERN HORIZON OUR PERFECT ENJOYMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A
TRANQUIL AND CONTENTED ECSTASY
THE STAGE WHIRLED ALONG AT A SPANKING
GAIT THE BREEZE FLAPPING CURTAINS AND SUSPENDED COATS IN A MOST
EXHILARATING WAY THE CRADLE SWAYED AND SWUNG LUXURIOUSLY THE PATTERING
OF THE HORSES' HOOFS THE CRACKING OF THE DRIVER'S WHIP AND HIS HI YI
G'LANG WERE MUSIC THE SPINNING GROUND AND THE WALTZING TREES APPEARED
TO GIVE US A MUTE HURRAH AS WE WENT BY AND THEN SLACK UP AND LOOK AFTER
US WITH INTEREST OR ENVY OR SOMETHING AND AS WE LAY AND SMOKED THE
PIPE OF PEACE AND COMPARED ALL THIS LUXURY WITH THE YEARS OF TIRESOME
CITY LIFE THAT HAD GONE BEFORE IT WE FELT THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE
COMPLETE AND SATISFYING HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD AND WE HAD FOUND IT
AFTER BREAKFAST AT SOME STATION WHOSE NAME I HAVE FORGOTTEN WE THREE
CLIMBED UP ON THE SEAT BEHIND THE DRIVER AND LET THE CONDUCTOR HAVE OUR
BED FOR A NAP
AND BY AND BY WHEN THE SUN MADE ME DROWSY I LAY DOWN ON
MY FACE ON TOP OF THE COACH GRASPING THE SLENDER IRON RAILING AND SLEPT
FOR AN HOUR OR MORE
THAT WILL GIVE ONE AN APPRECIABLE IDEA OF THOSE
MATCHLESS ROADS
INSTINCT WILL MAKE A SLEEPING MAN GRIP A FAST HOLD OF
THE RAILING WHEN THE STAGE JOLTS BUT WHEN IT ONLY SWINGS AND SWAYS NO
GRIP IS NECESSARY
OVERLAND DRIVERS AND CONDUCTORS USED TO SIT IN THEIR
PLACES AND SLEEP THIRTY OR FORTY MINUTES AT A TIME ON GOOD ROADS WHILE
SPINNING ALONG AT THE RATE OF EIGHT OR TEN MILES AN HOUR
I SAW THEM DO
IT OFTEN
THERE WAS NO DANGER ABOUT IT A SLEEPING MAN WILL SEIZE THE
IRONS IN TIME WHEN THE COACH JOLTS
THESE MEN WERE HARD WORKED AND IT
WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO STAY AWAKE ALL THE TIME
BY AND BY WE PASSED THROUGH MARYSVILLE AND OVER THE BIG BLUE AND LITTLE
SANDY THENCE ABOUT A MILE AND ENTERED NEBRASKA
ABOUT A MILE FURTHER
ON WE CAME TO THE BIG SANDY ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILES FROM ST
JOSEPH
AS THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN WE SAW THE FIRST SPECIMEN OF AN ANIMAL KNOWN
FAMILIARLY OVER TWO THOUSAND MILES OF MOUNTAIN AND DESERT FROM KANSAS
CLEAR TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN AS THE JACKASS RABBIT HE IS WELL NAMED
HE IS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER RABBIT EXCEPT THAT HE IS FROM ONE THIRD TO
TWICE AS LARGE HAS LONGER LEGS IN PROPORTION TO HIS SIZE AND HAS THE
MOST PREPOSTEROUS EARS THAT EVER WERE MOUNTED ON ANY CREATURE BUT A
JACKASS
WHEN HE IS SITTING QUIET THINKING ABOUT HIS SINS OR IS ABSENT MINDED OR
UNAPPREHENSIVE OF DANGER HIS MAJESTIC EARS PROJECT ABOVE HIM
CONSPICUOUSLY BUT THE BREAKING OF A TWIG WILL SCARE HIM NEARLY TO DEATH
AND THEN HE TILTS HIS EARS BACK GENTLY AND STARTS FOR HOME
ALL YOU CAN
SEE THEN FOR THE NEXT MINUTE IS HIS LONG GRAY FORM STRETCHED OUT
STRAIGHT AND STREAKING IT THROUGH THE LOW SAGE BRUSH HEAD ERECT EYES
RIGHT AND EARS JUST CANTED A LITTLE TO THE REAR BUT SHOWING YOU WHERE
THE ANIMAL IS ALL THE TIME THE SAME AS IF HE CARRIED A JIB
NOW AND
THEN HE MAKES A MARVELOUS SPRING WITH HIS LONG LEGS HIGH OVER THE
STUNTED SAGE BRUSH AND SCORES A LEAP THAT WOULD MAKE A HORSE ENVIOUS
PRESENTLY HE COMES DOWN TO A LONG GRACEFUL LOPE AND SHORTLY HE
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARS
HE HAS CROUCHED BEHIND A SAGE BUSH AND WILL
SIT THERE AND LISTEN AND TREMBLE UNTIL YOU GET WITHIN SIX FEET OF HIM
WHEN HE WILL GET UNDER WAY AGAIN
BUT ONE MUST SHOOT AT THIS CREATURE
ONCE IF HE WISHES TO SEE HIM THROW HIS HEART INTO HIS HEELS AND DO THE
BEST HE KNOWS HOW
HE IS FRIGHTENED CLEAR THROUGH NOW AND HE LAYS HIS
LONG EARS DOWN ON HIS BACK STRAIGHTENS HIMSELF OUT LIKE A YARD STICK
EVERY SPRING HE MAKES AND SCATTERS MILES BEHIND HIM WITH AN EASY
INDIFFERENCE THAT IS ENCHANTING
OUR PARTY MADE THIS SPECIMEN HUMP HIMSELF AS THE CONDUCTOR SAID
THE
SECRETARY STARTED HIM WITH A SHOT FROM THE COLT I COMMENCED SPITTING AT
HIM WITH MY WEAPON AND ALL IN THE SAME INSTANT THE OLD ALLEN'S WHOLE
BROADSIDE LET GO WITH A RATTLING CRASH AND IT IS NOT PUTTING IT TOO
STRONG TO SAY THAT THE RABBIT WAS FRANTIC HE DROPPED HIS EARS SET UP
HIS TAIL AND LEFT FOR SAN FRANCISCO AT A SPEED WHICH CAN ONLY BE
DESCRIBED AS A FLASH AND A VANISH LONG AFTER HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT WE
COULD HEAR HIM WHIZ
I DO NOT REMEMBER WHERE WE FIRST CAME ACROSS SAGE BRUSH BUT AS I HAVE
BEEN SPEAKING OF IT I MAY AS WELL DESCRIBE IT
THIS IS EASILY DONE FOR IF THE READER CAN IMAGINE A GNARLED AND
VENERABLE LIVE OAK TREE REDUCED TO A LITTLE SHRUB TWO FEET HIGH WITH ITS
ROUGH BARK ITS FOLIAGE ITS TWISTED BOUGHS ALL COMPLETE HE CAN PICTURE
THE SAGE BRUSH EXACTLY
OFTEN ON LAZY AFTERNOONS IN THE MOUNTAINS I
HAVE LAIN ON THE GROUND WITH MY FACE UNDER A SAGE BUSH AND ENTERTAINED
MYSELF WITH FANCYING THAT THE GNATS AMONG ITS FOLIAGE WERE LILIPUTIAN
BIRDS AND THAT THE ANTS MARCHING AND COUNTERMARCHING ABOUT ITS BASE WERE
LILIPUTIAN FLOCKS AND HERDS AND MYSELF SOME VAST LOAFER FROM BROBDIGNAG
WAITING TO CATCH A LITTLE CITIZEN AND EAT HIM
IT IS AN IMPOSING MONARCH OF THE FOREST IN EXQUISITE MINIATURE IS THE
SAGE BRUSH ITS FOLIAGE IS A GRAYISH GREEN AND GIVES THAT TINT TO
DESERT AND MOUNTAIN
IT SMELLS LIKE OUR DOMESTIC SAGE AND SAGE TEA
MADE FROM IT TASTE LIKE THE SAGE TEA WHICH ALL BOYS ARE SO WELL
ACQUAINTED WITH
THE SAGE BRUSH IS A SINGULARLY HARDY PLANT AND GROWS
RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF DEEP SAND AND AMONG BARREN ROCKS WHERE NOTHING
ELSE IN THE VEGETABLE WORLD WOULD TRY TO GROW EXCEPT BUNCH GRASS
BUNCH GRASS GROWS ON THE BLEAK MOUNTAIN SIDES OF NEVADA AND
NEIGHBORING TERRITORIES AND OFFERS EXCELLENT FEED FOR STOCK EVEN IN THE
DEAD OF WINTER WHEREVER THE SNOW IS BLOWN ASIDE AND EXPOSES IT
NOTWITHSTANDING ITS UNPROMISING HOME BUNCH GRASS IS A BETTER AND MORE
NUTRITIOUS DIET FOR CATTLE AND HORSES THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER HAY OR GRASS
THAT IS KNOWN SO STOCK MEN SAY THE SAGE BUSHES GROW FROM THREE TO
SIX OR SEVEN FEET APART ALL OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS OF THE FAR
WEST CLEAR TO THE BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA
THERE IS NOT A TREE OF ANY
KIND IN THE DESERTS FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES THERE IS NO VEGETATION AT ALL
IN A REGULAR DESERT EXCEPT THE SAGE BRUSH AND ITS COUSIN THE
GREASEWOOD WHICH IS SO MUCH LIKE THE SAGE BRUSH THAT THE DIFFERENCE
AMOUNTS TO LITTLE
CAMP FIRES AND HOT SUPPERS IN THE DESERTS WOULD BE
IMPOSSIBLE BUT FOR THE FRIENDLY SAGE BRUSH
ITS TRUNK IS AS LARGE AS A
BOY'S WRIST AND FROM THAT UP TO A MAN'S ARM AND ITS CROOKED BRANCHES
ARE HALF AS LARGE AS ITS TRUNK ALL GOOD SOUND HARD WOOD VERY LIKE
OAK
WHEN A PARTY CAMPS THE FIRST THING TO BE DONE IS TO CUT SAGE BRUSH AND
IN A FEW MINUTES THERE IS AN OPULENT PILE OF IT READY FOR USE
A HOLE A
FOOT WIDE TWO FEET DEEP AND TWO FEET LONG IS DUG AND SAGE BRUSH
CHOPPED UP AND BURNED IN IT TILL IT IS FULL TO THE BRIM WITH GLOWING
COALS
THEN THE COOKING BEGINS AND THERE IS NO SMOKE AND CONSEQUENTLY
NO SWEARING
SUCH A FIRE WILL KEEP ALL NIGHT WITH VERY LITTLE
REPLENISHING AND IT MAKES A VERY SOCIABLE CAMP FIRE AND ONE AROUND
WHICH THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE REMINISCENCES SOUND PLAUSIBLE INSTRUCTIVE AND
PROFOUNDLY ENTERTAINING
SAGE BRUSH IS VERY FAIR FUEL BUT AS A VEGETABLE IT IS A DISTINGUISHED
FAILURE
NOTHING CAN ABIDE THE TASTE OF IT BUT THE JACKASS AND HIS
ILLEGITIMATE CHILD THE MULE
BUT THEIR TESTIMONY TO ITS NUTRITIOUSNESS
IS WORTH NOTHING FOR THEY WILL EAT PINE KNOTS OR ANTHRACITE COAL OR
BRASS FILINGS OR LEAD PIPE OR OLD BOTTLES OR ANYTHING THAT COMES
HANDY AND THEN GO OFF LOOKING AS GRATEFUL AS IF THEY HAD HAD OYSTERS FOR
DINNER
MULES AND DONKEYS AND CAMELS HAVE APPETITES THAT ANYTHING WILL
RELIEVE TEMPORARILY BUT NOTHING SATISFY
IN SYRIA ONCE AT THE HEAD WATERS OF THE JORDAN A CAMEL TOOK CHARGE OF
MY OVERCOAT WHILE THE TENTS WERE BEING PITCHED AND EXAMINED IT WITH A
CRITICAL EYE ALL OVER WITH AS MUCH INTEREST AS IF HE HAD AN IDEA OF
GETTING ONE MADE LIKE IT AND THEN AFTER HE WAS DONE FIGURING ON IT AS
AN ARTICLE OF APPAREL HE BEGAN TO CONTEMPLATE IT AS AN ARTICLE OF DIET
HE PUT HIS FOOT ON IT AND LIFTED ONE OF THE SLEEVES OUT WITH HIS TEETH
AND CHEWED AND CHEWED AT IT GRADUALLY TAKING IT IN AND ALL THE WHILE
OPENING AND CLOSING HIS EYES IN A KIND OF RELIGIOUS ECSTASY AS IF HE HAD
NEVER TASTED ANYTHING AS GOOD AS AN OVERCOAT BEFORE IN HIS LIFE
THEN
HE SMACKED HIS LIPS ONCE OR TWICE AND REACHED AFTER THE OTHER SLEEVE
NEXT HE TRIED THE VELVET COLLAR AND SMILED A SMILE OF SUCH CONTENTMENT
THAT IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT HE REGARDED THAT AS THE DAINTIEST THING
ABOUT AN OVERCOAT
THE TAILS WENT NEXT ALONG WITH SOME PERCUSSION CAPS
AND COUGH CANDY AND SOME FIG PASTE FROM CONSTANTINOPLE
AND THEN MY
NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENCE DROPPED OUT AND HE TOOK A CHANCE IN THAT
MANUSCRIPT LETTERS WRITTEN FOR THE HOME PAPERS
BUT HE WAS TREADING ON
DANGEROUS GROUND NOW
HE BEGAN TO COME ACROSS SOLID WISDOM IN THOSE
DOCUMENTS THAT WAS RATHER WEIGHTY ON HIS STOMACH AND OCCASIONALLY HE
WOULD TAKE A JOKE THAT WOULD SHAKE HIM UP TILL IT LOOSENED HIS TEETH IT
WAS GETTING TO BE PERILOUS TIMES WITH HIM BUT HE HELD HIS GRIP WITH GOOD
COURAGE AND HOPEFULLY TILL AT LAST HE BEGAN TO STUMBLE ON STATEMENTS
THAT NOT EVEN A CAMEL COULD SWALLOW WITH IMPUNITY
HE BEGAN TO GAG AND
GASP AND HIS EYES TO STAND OUT AND HIS FORELEGS TO SPREAD AND IN ABOUT
A QUARTER OF A MINUTE HE FELL OVER AS STIFF AS A CARPENTER'S WORK BENCH
AND DIED A DEATH OF INDESCRIBABLE AGONY
I WENT AND PULLED THE
MANUSCRIPT OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND FOUND THAT THE SENSITIVE CREATURE HAD
CHOKED TO DEATH ON ONE OF THE MILDEST AND GENTLEST STATEMENTS OF FACT
THAT I EVER LAID BEFORE A TRUSTING PUBLIC
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY WHEN DIVERTED FROM MY SUBJECT THAT OCCASIONALLY ONE
FINDS SAGE BUSHES FIVE OR SIX FEET HIGH AND WITH A SPREAD OF BRANCH AND
FOLIAGE IN PROPORTION BUT TWO OR TWO AND A HALF FEET IS THE USUAL
HEIGHT
CHAPTER IV
AS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE EVENING CHILL CAME ON WE MADE PREPARATION
FOR BED
WE STIRRED UP THE HARD LEATHER LETTER SACKS AND THE KNOTTY
CANVAS BAGS OF PRINTED MATTER KNOTTY AND UNEVEN BECAUSE OF PROJECTING
ENDS AND CORNERS OF MAGAZINES BOXES AND BOOKS
WE STIRRED THEM UP AND
REDISPOSED THEM IN SUCH A WAY AS TO MAKE OUR BED AS LEVEL AS POSSIBLE
AND WE DID IMPROVE IT TOO THOUGH AFTER ALL OUR WORK IT HAD AN UPHEAVED
AND BILLOWY LOOK ABOUT IT LIKE A LITTLE PIECE OF A STORMY SEA
NEXT WE
HUNTED UP OUR BOOTS FROM ODD NOOKS AMONG THE MAIL BAGS WHERE THEY HAD
SETTLED AND PUT THEM ON
THEN WE GOT DOWN OUR COATS VESTS PANTALOONS
AND HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRTS FROM THE ARM LOOPS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SWINGING
ALL DAY AND CLOTHED OURSELVES IN THEM FOR THERE BEING NO LADIES EITHER
AT THE STATIONS OR IN THE COACH AND THE WEATHER BEING HOT WE HAD LOOKED
TO OUR COMFORT BY STRIPPING TO OUR UNDERCLOTHING AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING
ALL THINGS BEING NOW READY WE STOWED THE UNEASY DICTIONARY
WHERE IT WOULD LIE AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE AND PLACED THE WATER CANTEENS
AND PISTOLS WHERE WE COULD FIND THEM IN THE DARK
THEN WE SMOKED A FINAL
PIPE AND SWAPPED A FINAL YARN AFTER WHICH WE PUT THE PIPES TOBACCO
AND BAG OF COIN IN SNUG HOLES AND CAVES AMONG THE MAIL BAGS AND THEN
FASTENED DOWN THE COACH CURTAINS ALL AROUND AND MADE THE PLACE AS DARK
AS THE INSIDE OF A COW AS THE CONDUCTOR PHRASED IT IN HIS PICTURESQUE
WAY
IT WAS CERTAINLY AS DARK AS ANY PLACE COULD BE NOTHING WAS EVEN
DIMLY VISIBLE IN IT
AND FINALLY WE ROLLED OURSELVES UP LIKE
SILK WORMS EACH PERSON IN HIS OWN BLANKET AND SANK PEACEFULLY TO SLEEP
WHENEVER THE STAGE STOPPED TO CHANGE HORSES WE WOULD WAKE UP AND TRY TO
RECOLLECT WHERE WE WERE AND SUCCEED AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE STAGE
WOULD BE OFF AGAIN AND WE LIKEWISE
WE BEGAN TO GET INTO COUNTRY NOW
THREADED HERE AND THERE WITH LITTLE STREAMS
THESE HAD HIGH STEEP BANKS
ON EACH SIDE AND EVERY TIME WE FLEW DOWN ONE BANK AND SCRAMBLED UP THE
OTHER OUR PARTY INSIDE GOT MIXED SOMEWHAT
FIRST WE WOULD ALL BE DOWN
IN A PILE AT THE FORWARD END OF THE STAGE NEARLY IN A SITTING POSTURE
AND IN A SECOND WE WOULD SHOOT TO THE OTHER END AND STAND ON OUR HEADS
AND WE WOULD SPRAWL AND KICK TOO AND WARD OFF ENDS AND CORNERS OF
MAIL BAGS THAT CAME LUMBERING OVER US AND ABOUT US AND AS THE DUST ROSE
FROM THE TUMULT WE WOULD ALL SNEEZE IN CHORUS AND THE MAJORITY OF US
WOULD GRUMBLE AND PROBABLY SAY SOME HASTY THING LIKE TAKE YOUR ELBOW
OUT OF MY RIBS CAN'T YOU QUIT CROWDING
EVERY TIME WE AVALANCHED FROM ONE END OF THE STAGE TO THE OTHER THE
UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY WOULD COME TOO AND EVERY TIME IT CAME IT DAMAGED
SOMEBODY
ONE TRIP IT BARKED THE SECRETARY'S ELBOW THE NEXT TRIP IT
HURT ME IN THE STOMACH AND THE THIRD IT TILTED BEMIS'S NOSE UP TILL HE
COULD LOOK DOWN HIS NOSTRILS HE SAID
THE PISTOLS AND COIN SOON SETTLED
TO THE BOTTOM BUT THE PIPES PIPE STEMS TOBACCO AND CANTEENS CLATTERED
AND FLOUNDERED AFTER THE DICTIONARY EVERY TIME IT MADE AN ASSAULT ON US
AND AIDED AND ABETTED THE BOOK BY SPILLING TOBACCO IN OUR EYES AND WATER
DOWN OUR BACKS
STILL ALL THINGS CONSIDERED IT WAS A VERY COMFORTABLE NIGHT
IT WORE
GRADUALLY AWAY AND WHEN AT LAST A COLD GRAY LIGHT WAS VISIBLE THROUGH
THE PUCKERS AND CHINKS IN THE CURTAINS WE YAWNED AND STRETCHED WITH
SATISFACTION SHED OUR COCOONS AND FELT THAT WE HAD SLEPT AS MUCH AS WAS
NECESSARY
BY AND BY AS THE SUN ROSE UP AND WARMED THE WORLD WE PULLED
OFF OUR CLOTHES AND GOT READY FOR BREAKFAST
WE WERE JUST PLEASANTLY IN
TIME FOR FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARD THE DRIVER SENT THE WEIRD MUSIC OF HIS
BUGLE WINDING OVER THE GRASSY SOLITUDES AND PRESENTLY WE DETECTED A LOW
HUT OR TWO IN THE DISTANCE
THEN THE RATTLING OF THE COACH THE CLATTER
OF OUR SIX HORSES' HOOFS AND THE DRIVER'S CRISP COMMANDS AWOKE TO A
LOUDER AND STRONGER EMPHASIS AND WE WENT SWEEPING DOWN ON THE STATION AT
OUR SMARTEST SPEED
IT WAS FASCINATING THAT OLD OVERLAND STAGECOACHING
WE JUMPED OUT IN UNDRESS UNIFORM
THE DRIVER TOSSED HIS GATHERED REINS
OUT ON THE GROUND GAPED AND STRETCHED COMPLACENTLY DREW OFF HIS HEAVY
BUCKSKIN GLOVES WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND INSUFFERABLE DIGNITY TAKING
NOT THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE OF A DOZEN SOLICITOUS INQUIRES AFTER HIS HEALTH
AND HUMBLY FACETIOUS AND FLATTERING ACCOSTINGS AND OBSEQUIOUS TENDERS OF
SERVICE FROM FIVE OR SIX HAIRY AND HALF CIVILIZED STATION KEEPERS AND
HOSTLERS WHO WERE NIMBLY UNHITCHING OUR STEEDS AND BRINGING THE FRESH
TEAM OUT OF THE STABLES FOR IN THE EYES OF THE STAGE DRIVER OF THAT DAY
STATION KEEPERS AND HOSTLERS WERE A SORT OF GOOD ENOUGH LOW CREATURES
USEFUL IN THEIR PLACE AND HELPING TO MAKE UP A WORLD BUT NOT THE KIND
OF BEINGS WHICH A PERSON OF DISTINCTION COULD AFFORD TO CONCERN HIMSELF
WITH WHILE ON THE CONTRARY IN THE EYES OF THE STATION KEEPER AND THE
HOSTLER THE STAGE DRIVER WAS A HERO A GREAT AND SHINING DIGNITARY THE
WORLD'S FAVORITE SON THE ENVY OF THE PEOPLE THE OBSERVED OF THE
NATIONS
WHEN THEY SPOKE TO HIM THEY RECEIVED HIS INSOLENT SILENCE
MEEKLY AND AS BEING THE NATURAL AND PROPER CONDUCT OF SO GREAT A MAN
WHEN HE OPENED HIS LIPS THEY ALL HUNG ON HIS WORDS WITH ADMIRATION HE
NEVER HONORED A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WITH A REMARK BUT ADDRESSED IT
WITH A BROAD GENERALITY TO THE HORSES THE STABLES THE SURROUNDING
COUNTRY AND THE HUMAN UNDERLINGS WHEN HE DISCHARGED A FACETIOUS
INSULTING PERSONALITY AT A HOSTLER THAT HOSTLER WAS HAPPY FOR THE DAY
WHEN HE UTTERED HIS ONE JEST OLD AS THE HILLS COARSE PROFANE WITLESS
AND INFLICTED ON THE SAME AUDIENCE IN THE SAME LANGUAGE EVERY TIME HIS
COACH DROVE UP THERE THE VARLETS ROARED AND SLAPPED THEIR THIGHS AND
SWORE IT WAS THE BEST THING THEY'D EVER HEARD IN ALL THEIR LIVES
AND
HOW THEY WOULD FLY AROUND WHEN HE WANTED A BASIN OF WATER A GOURD OF THE
SAME OR A LIGHT FOR HIS PIPE BUT THEY WOULD INSTANTLY INSULT A
PASSENGER IF HE SO FAR FORGOT HIMSELF AS TO CRAVE A FAVOR AT THEIR HANDS
THEY COULD DO THAT SORT OF INSOLENCE AS WELL AS THE DRIVER THEY COPIED IT
FROM FOR LET IT BE BORNE IN MIND THE OVERLAND DRIVER HAD BUT LITTLE
LESS CONTEMPT FOR HIS PASSENGERS THAN HE HAD FOR HIS HOSTLERS
THE HOSTLERS AND STATION KEEPERS TREATED THE REALLY POWERFUL CONDUCTOR OF
THE COACH MERELY WITH THE BEST OF WHAT WAS THEIR IDEA OF CIVILITY BUT
THE DRIVER WAS THE ONLY BEING THEY BOWED DOWN TO AND WORSHIPPED
HOW
ADMIRINGLY THEY WOULD GAZE UP AT HIM IN HIS HIGH SEAT AS HE GLOVED
HIMSELF WITH LINGERING DELIBERATION WHILE SOME HAPPY HOSTLER HELD THE
BUNCH OF REINS ALOFT AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR HIM TO TAKE IT AND HOW
THEY WOULD BOMBARD HIM WITH GLORIFYING EJACULATIONS AS HE CRACKED HIS
LONG WHIP AND WENT CAREERING AWAY
THE STATION BUILDINGS WERE LONG LOW HUTS MADE OF SUNDRIED MUD COLORED
BRICKS LAID UP WITHOUT MORTAR ADOBES THE SPANIARDS CALL THESE BRICKS
AND AMERICANS SHORTEN IT TO 'DOBIES
THE ROOFS WHICH HAD NO SLANT TO
THEM WORTH SPEAKING OF WERE THATCHED AND THEN SODDED OR COVERED WITH A
THICK LAYER OF EARTH AND FROM THIS SPRUNG A PRETTY RANK GROWTH OF WEEDS
AND GRASS
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD EVER SEEN A MAN'S FRONT YARD ON
TOP OF HIS HOUSE
THE BUILDING CONSISTED OF BARNS STABLE ROOM FOR
TWELVE OR FIFTEEN HORSES AND A HUT FOR AN EATING ROOM FOR PASSENGERS
THIS LATTER HAD BUNKS IN IT FOR THE STATION KEEPER AND A HOSTLER OR TWO
YOU COULD REST YOUR ELBOW ON ITS EAVES AND YOU HAD TO BEND IN ORDER TO
GET IN AT THE DOOR
IN PLACE OF A WINDOW THERE WAS A SQUARE HOLE ABOUT
LARGE ENOUGH FOR A MAN TO CRAWL THROUGH BUT THIS HAD NO GLASS IN IT
THERE WAS NO FLOORING BUT THE GROUND WAS PACKED HARD
THERE WAS NO
STOVE BUT THE FIRE PLACE SERVED ALL NEEDFUL PURPOSES
THERE WERE NO
SHELVES NO CUPBOARDS NO CLOSETS
IN A CORNER STOOD AN OPEN SACK OF
FLOUR AND NESTLING AGAINST ITS BASE WERE A COUPLE OF BLACK AND VENERABLE
TIN COFFEE POTS A TIN TEAPOT A LITTLE BAG OF SALT AND A SIDE OF BACON
BY THE DOOR OF THE STATION KEEPER'S DEN OUTSIDE WAS A TIN WASH BASIN
ON THE GROUND
NEAR IT WAS A PAIL OF WATER AND A PIECE OF YELLOW BAR
SOAP AND FROM THE EAVES HUNG A HOARY BLUE WOOLEN SHIRT SIGNIFICANTLY
BUT THIS LATTER WAS THE STATION KEEPER'S PRIVATE TOWEL AND ONLY TWO
PERSONS IN ALL THE PARTY MIGHT VENTURE TO USE IT THE STAGE DRIVER AND
THE CONDUCTOR
THE LATTER WOULD NOT FROM A SENSE OF DECENCY THE FORMER
WOULD NOT BECAUSE DID NOT CHOOSE TO ENCOURAGE THE ADVANCES OF A
STATION KEEPER
WE HAD TOWELS IN THE VALISE THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
BEEN IN SODOM AND GOMORRAH
WE AND THE CONDUCTOR USED OUR
HANDKERCHIEFS AND THE DRIVER HIS PANTALOONS AND SLEEVES
BY THE DOOR
INSIDE WAS FASTENED A SMALL OLD FASHIONED LOOKING GLASS FRAME WITH TWO
LITTLE FRAGMENTS OF THE ORIGINAL MIRROR LODGED DOWN IN ONE CORNER OF IT
THIS ARRANGEMENT AFFORDED A PLEASANT DOUBLE BARRELED PORTRAIT OF YOU WHEN
YOU LOOKED INTO IT WITH ONE HALF OF YOUR HEAD SET UP A COUPLE OF INCHES
ABOVE THE OTHER HALF
FROM THE GLASS FRAME HUNG THE HALF OF A COMB BY A
STRING BUT IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE THAT PATRIARCH OR DIE I BELIEVE I WOULD
ORDER SOME SAMPLE COFFINS
IT HAD COME DOWN FROM ESAU AND SAMSON AND HAD BEEN ACCUMULATING HAIR
EVER SINCE ALONG WITH CERTAIN IMPURITIES
IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM
STOOD THREE OR FOUR RIFLES AND MUSKETS TOGETHER WITH HORNS AND POUCHES
OF AMMUNITION
THE STATION MEN WORE PANTALOONS OF COARSE COUNTRY WOVEN
STUFF AND INTO THE SEAT AND THE INSIDE OF THE LEGS WERE SEWED AMPLE
ADDITIONS OF BUCKSKIN TO DO DUTY IN PLACE OF LEGGINGS WHEN THE MAN RODE
HORSEBACK SO THE PANTS WERE HALF DULL BLUE AND HALF YELLOW AND
UNSPEAKABLY PICTURESQUE
THE PANTS WERE STUFFED INTO THE TOPS OF HIGH
BOOTS THE HEELS WHEREOF WERE ARMED WITH GREAT SPANISH SPURS WHOSE
LITTLE IRON CLOGS AND CHAINS JINGLED WITH EVERY STEP
THE MAN WORE A
HUGE BEARD AND MUSTACHIOS AN OLD SLOUCH HAT A BLUE WOOLEN SHIRT NO
SUSPENDERS NO VEST NO COAT IN A LEATHERN SHEATH IN HIS BELT A GREAT
LONG NAVY REVOLVER SLUNG ON RIGHT SIDE HAMMER TO THE FRONT AND
PROJECTING FROM HIS BOOT A HORN HANDLED BOWIE KNIFE
THE FURNITURE OF
THE HUT WAS NEITHER GORGEOUS NOR MUCH IN THE WAY
THE ROCKING CHAIRS AND
SOFAS WERE NOT PRESENT AND NEVER HAD BEEN BUT THEY WERE REPRESENTED BY
TWO THREE LEGGED STOOLS A PINE BOARD BENCH FOUR FEET LONG AND TWO EMPTY
CANDLE BOXES
THE TABLE WAS A GREASY BOARD ON STILTS AND THE
TABLE CLOTH AND NAPKINS HAD NOT COME AND THEY WERE NOT LOOKING FOR THEM
EITHER
A BATTERED TIN PLATTER A KNIFE AND FORK AND A TIN PINT CUP
WERE AT EACH MAN'S PLACE AND THE DRIVER HAD A QUEENS WARE SAUCER THAT
HAD SEEN BETTER DAYS
OF COURSE THIS DUKE SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE
THERE WAS ONE ISOLATED PIECE OF TABLE FURNITURE THAT BORE ABOUT IT A
TOUCHING AIR OF GRANDEUR IN MISFORTUNE
THIS WAS THE CASTER
IT WAS
GERMAN SILVER AND CRIPPLED AND RUSTY BUT IT WAS SO PREPOSTEROUSLY OUT
OF PLACE THERE THAT IT WAS SUGGESTIVE OF A TATTERED EXILED KING AMONG
BARBARIANS AND THE MAJESTY OF ITS NATIVE POSITION COMPELLED RESPECT EVEN
IN ITS DEGRADATION
THERE WAS ONLY ONE CRUET LEFT AND THAT WAS A STOPPERLESS FLY SPECKED
BROKEN NECKED THING WITH TWO INCHES OF VINEGAR IN IT AND A DOZEN
PRESERVED FLIES WITH THEIR HEELS UP AND LOOKING SORRY THEY HAD INVESTED
THERE
THE STATION KEEPER UPENDED A DISK OF LAST WEEK'S BREAD OF THE SHAPE AND
SIZE OF AN OLD TIME CHEESE AND CARVED SOME SLABS FROM IT WHICH WERE AS
GOOD AS NICHOLSON PAVEMENT AND TENDERER
HE SLICED OFF A PIECE OF BACON FOR EACH MAN BUT ONLY THE EXPERIENCED OLD
HANDS MADE OUT TO EAT IT FOR IT WAS CONDEMNED ARMY BACON WHICH THE
UNITED STATES WOULD NOT FEED TO ITS SOLDIERS IN THE FORTS AND THE STAGE
COMPANY HAD BOUGHT IT CHEAP FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF THEIR PASSENGERS AND
EMPLOYEES
WE MAY HAVE FOUND THIS CONDEMNED ARMY BACON FURTHER OUT ON
THE PLAINS THAN THE SECTION I AM LOCATING IT IN BUT WE FOUND IT THERE
IS NO GAINSAYING THAT
THEN HE POURED FOR US A BEVERAGE WHICH HE CALLED SLUM GULLION AND IT
IS HARD TO THINK HE WAS NOT INSPIRED WHEN HE NAMED IT
IT REALLY
PRETENDED TO BE TEA BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH DISH RAG AND SAND AND OLD
BACON RIND IN IT TO DECEIVE THE INTELLIGENT TRAVELER
HE HAD NO SUGAR AND NO MILK NOT EVEN A SPOON TO STIR THE INGREDIENTS
WITH
WE COULD NOT EAT THE BREAD OR THE MEAT NOR DRINK THE SLUMGULLION AND
WHEN I LOOKED AT THAT MELANCHOLY VINEGAR CRUET I THOUGHT OF THE ANECDOTE
A VERY VERY OLD ONE EVEN AT THAT DAY OF THE TRAVELER WHO SAT DOWN TO
A TABLE WHICH HAD NOTHING ON IT BUT A MACKEREL AND A POT OF MUSTARD
HE
ASKED THE LANDLORD IF THIS WAS ALL
THE LANDLORD SAID
ALL WHY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING I SHOULD THINK THERE WAS MACKEREL
ENOUGH THERE FOR SIX
BUT I DON'T LIKE MACKEREL
OH THEN HELP YOURSELF TO THE MUSTARD
IN OTHER DAYS I HAD CONSIDERED IT A GOOD A VERY GOOD ANECDOTE BUT
THERE WAS A DISMAL PLAUSIBILITY ABOUT IT HERE THAT TOOK ALL THE HUMOR
OUT OF IT
OUR BREAKFAST WAS BEFORE US BUT OUR TEETH WERE IDLE
I TASTED AND SMELT AND SAID I WOULD TAKE COFFEE I BELIEVED
THE
STATION BOSS STOPPED DEAD STILL AND GLARED AT ME SPEECHLESS
AT LAST
WHEN HE CAME TO HE TURNED AWAY AND SAID AS ONE WHO COMMUNES WITH
HIMSELF UPON A MATTER TOO VAST TO GRASP
COFFEE WELL IF THAT DON'T GO CLEAN AHEAD OF ME I'M D D
WE COULD NOT EAT AND THERE WAS NO CONVERSATION AMONG THE HOSTLERS AND
HERDSMEN WE ALL SAT AT THE SAME BOARD
AT LEAST THERE WAS NO
CONVERSATION FURTHER THAN A SINGLE HURRIED REQUEST NOW AND THEN FROM
ONE EMPLOYEE TO ANOTHER
IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE SAME FORM AND ALWAYS
GRUFFLY FRIENDLY
ITS WESTERN FRESHNESS AND NOVELTY STARTLED ME AT
FIRST AND INTERESTED ME BUT IT PRESENTLY GREW MONOTONOUS AND LOST ITS
CHARM
IT WAS
PASS THE BREAD YOU SON OF A SKUNK NO I FORGET SKUNK WAS NOT THE
WORD IT SEEMS TO ME IT WAS STILL STRONGER THAN THAT I KNOW IT WAS IN
FACT BUT IT IS GONE FROM MY MEMORY APPARENTLY
HOWEVER IT IS NO
MATTER PROBABLY IT WAS TOO STRONG FOR PRINT ANYWAY
IT IS THE LANDMARK
IN MY MEMORY WHICH TELLS ME WHERE I FIRST ENCOUNTERED THE VIGOROUS NEW
VERNACULAR OF THE OCCIDENTAL PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS
WE GAVE UP THE BREAKFAST AND PAID OUR DOLLAR APIECE AND WENT BACK TO OUR
MAIL BAG BED IN THE COACH AND FOUND COMFORT IN OUR PIPES
RIGHT HERE WE
SUFFERED THE FIRST DIMINUTION OF OUR PRINCELY STATE
WE LEFT OUR SIX
FINE HORSES AND TOOK SIX MULES IN THEIR PLACE
BUT THEY WERE WILD
MEXICAN FELLOWS AND A MAN HAD TO STAND AT THE HEAD OF EACH OF THEM AND
HOLD HIM FAST WHILE THE DRIVER GLOVED AND GOT HIMSELF READY
AND WHEN AT
LAST HE GRASPED THE REINS AND GAVE THE WORD THE MEN SPRUNG SUDDENLY AWAY
FROM THE MULES' HEADS AND THE COACH SHOT FROM THE STATION AS IF IT HAD
ISSUED FROM A CANNON
HOW THE FRANTIC ANIMALS DID SCAMPER IT WAS A
FIERCE AND FURIOUS GALLOP AND THE GAIT NEVER ALTERED FOR A MOMENT TILL
WE REELED OFF TEN OR TWELVE MILES AND SWEPT UP TO THE NEXT COLLECTION OF
LITTLE STATION HUTS AND STABLES
SO WE FLEW ALONG ALL DAY
AT 2 P M
THE BELT OF TIMBER THAT FRINGES THE
NORTH PLATTE AND MARKS ITS WINDINGS THROUGH THE VAST LEVEL FLOOR OF THE
PLAINS CAME IN SIGHT
AT 4 P M
WE CROSSED A BRANCH OF THE RIVER AND
AT 5 P M
WE CROSSED THE PLATTE ITSELF AND LANDED AT FORT KEARNEY
FIFTY SIX HOURS OUT FROM ST
JOE THREE HUNDRED MILES
NOW THAT WAS STAGE COACHING ON THE GREAT OVERLAND TEN OR TWELVE YEARS
AGO WHEN PERHAPS NOT MORE THAN TEN MEN IN AMERICA ALL TOLD EXPECTED TO
LIVE TO SEE A RAILROAD FOLLOW THAT ROUTE TO THE PACIFIC
BUT THE
RAILROAD IS THERE NOW AND IT PICTURES A THOUSAND ODD COMPARISONS AND
CONTRASTS IN MY MIND TO READ THE FOLLOWING SKETCH IN THE NEW YORK TIMES
OF A RECENT TRIP OVER ALMOST THE VERY GROUND I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING
I
CAN SCARCELY COMPREHEND THE NEW STATE OF THINGS
ACROSS THE CONTINENT
AT 4 20 P M SUNDAY WE ROLLED OUT OF THE STATION AT OMAHA AND
STARTED WESTWARD ON OUR LONG JAUNT
A COUPLE OF HOURS OUT DINNER
WAS ANNOUNCED AN 'EVENT' TO THOSE OF US WHO HAD YET TO EXPERIENCE
WHAT IT IS TO EAT IN ONE OF PULLMAN'S HOTELS ON WHEELS SO STEPPING
INTO THE CAR NEXT FORWARD OF OUR SLEEPING PALACE WE FOUND OURSELVES
IN THE DINING CAR
IT WAS A REVELATION TO US THAT FIRST DINNER ON
SUNDAY
AND THOUGH WE CONTINUED TO DINE FOR FOUR DAYS AND HAD AS
MANY BREAKFASTS AND SUPPERS OUR WHOLE PARTY NEVER CEASED TO ADMIRE
THE PERFECTION OF THE ARRANGEMENTS AND THE MARVELOUS RESULTS
ACHIEVED
UPON TABLES COVERED WITH SNOWY LINEN AND GARNISHED WITH
SERVICES OF SOLID SILVER ETHIOP WAITERS FLITTING ABOUT IN SPOTLESS
WHITE PLACED AS BY MAGIC A REPAST AT WHICH DELMONICO HIMSELF COULD
HAVE HAD NO OCCASION TO BLUSH AND INDEED IN SOME RESPECTS IT
WOULD BE HARD FOR THAT DISTINGUISHED CHEF TO MATCH OUR MENU FOR IN
ADDITION TO ALL THAT ORDINARILY MAKES UP A FIRST CHOP DINNER HAD WE
NOT OUR ANTELOPE STEAK THE GORMAND WHO HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THIS
BAH WHAT DOES HE KNOW OF THE FEAST OF FAT THINGS OUR DELICIOUS
MOUNTAIN BROOK TROUT AND CHOICE FRUITS AND BERRIES AND SAUCE
PIQUANT AND UNPURCHASABLE OUR SWEET SCENTED APPETITE COMPELLING
AIR OF THE PRAIRIES
YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT WE ALL DID JUSTICE TO THE GOOD THINGS AND
AS WE WASHED THEM DOWN WITH BUMPERS OF SPARKLING KRUG WHILST WE
SPED ALONG AT THE RATE OF THIRTY MILES AN HOUR AGREED IT WAS THE
FASTEST LIVING WE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED
WE BEAT THAT HOWEVER TWO
DAYS AFTERWARD WHEN WE MADE TWENTY SEVEN MILES IN TWENTY SEVEN
MINUTES WHILE OUR CHAMPAGNE GLASSES FILLED TO THE BRIM SPILLED NOT
A DROP AFTER DINNER WE REPAIRED TO OUR DRAWING ROOM CAR AND AS
IT WAS SABBATH EVE INTONED SOME OF THE GRAND OLD HYMNS PRAISE GOD
FROM WHOM ETC SHINING SHORE CORONATION ETC THE VOICES OF
THE MEN SINGERS AND OF THE WOMEN SINGERS BLENDING SWEETLY IN THE
EVENING AIR WHILE OUR TRAIN WITH ITS GREAT GLARING POLYPHEMUS
EYE LIGHTING UP LONG VISTAS OF PRAIRIE RUSHED INTO THE NIGHT AND
THE WILD
THEN TO BED IN LUXURIOUS COUCHES WHERE WE SLEPT THE
SLEEP OF THE JUST AND ONLY AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING MONDAY AT EIGHT
O'CLOCK TO FIND OURSELVES AT THE CROSSING OF THE NORTH PLATTE
THREE HUNDRED MILES FROM OMAHA FIFTEEN HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES
OUT
CHAPTER V
ANOTHER NIGHT OF ALTERNATE TRANQUILLITY AND TURMOIL
BUT MORNING CAME
BY AND BY
IT WAS ANOTHER GLAD AWAKENING TO FRESH BREEZES VAST EXPANSES
OF LEVEL GREENSWARD BRIGHT SUNLIGHT AN IMPRESSIVE SOLITUDE UTTERLY
WITHOUT VISIBLE HUMAN BEINGS OR HUMAN HABITATIONS AND AN ATMOSPHERE OF
SUCH AMAZING MAGNIFYING PROPERTIES THAT TREES THAT SEEMED CLOSE AT HAND
WERE MORE THAN THREE MILE AWAY
WE RESUMED UNDRESS UNIFORM CLIMBED
A TOP OF THE FLYING COACH DANGLED OUR LEGS OVER THE SIDE SHOUTED
OCCASIONALLY AT OUR FRANTIC MULES MERELY TO SEE THEM LAY THEIR EARS BACK
AND SCAMPER FASTER TIED OUR HATS ON TO KEEP OUR HAIR FROM BLOWING AWAY
AND LEVELED AN OUTLOOK OVER THE WORLD WIDE CARPET ABOUT US FOR THINGS NEW
AND STRANGE TO GAZE AT
EVEN AT THIS DAY IT THRILLS ME THROUGH AND
THROUGH TO THINK OF THE LIFE THE GLADNESS AND THE WILD SENSE OF FREEDOM
THAT USED TO MAKE THE BLOOD DANCE IN MY VEINS ON THOSE FINE OVERLAND
MORNINGS
ALONG ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER BREAKFAST WE SAW THE FIRST PRAIRIE DOG
VILLAGES THE FIRST ANTELOPE AND THE FIRST WOLF
IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY
THIS LATTER WAS THE REGULAR CAYOTE PRONOUNCED KY O TE OF THE FARTHER
DESERTS
AND IF IT WAS HE WAS NOT A PRETTY CREATURE OR RESPECTABLE
EITHER FOR I GOT WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS RACE AFTERWARD AND CAN SPEAK
WITH CONFIDENCE
THE CAYOTE IS A LONG SLIM SICK AND SORRY LOOKING
SKELETON WITH A GRAY WOLF SKIN STRETCHED OVER IT A TOLERABLY BUSHY TAIL
THAT FOREVER SAGS DOWN WITH A DESPAIRING EXPRESSION OF FORSAKENNESS AND
MISERY A FURTIVE AND EVIL EYE AND A LONG SHARP FACE WITH SLIGHTLY
LIFTED LIP AND EXPOSED TEETH
HE HAS A GENERAL SLINKING EXPRESSION ALL
OVER
THE CAYOTE IS A LIVING BREATHING ALLEGORY OF WANT
HE IS ALWAYS
HUNGRY
HE IS ALWAYS POOR OUT OF LUCK AND FRIENDLESS
THE MEANEST CREATURES
DESPISE HIM AND EVEN THE FLEAS WOULD DESERT HIM FOR A VELOCIPEDE
HE IS
SO SPIRITLESS AND COWARDLY THAT EVEN WHILE HIS EXPOSED TEETH ARE
PRETENDING A THREAT THE REST OF HIS FACE IS APOLOGIZING FOR IT
AND HE
IS SO HOMELY SO SCRAWNY AND RIBBY AND COARSE HAIRED AND PITIFUL
WHEN HE SEES YOU HE LIFTS HIS LIP AND LETS A FLASH OF HIS TEETH OUT AND
THEN TURNS A LITTLE OUT OF THE COURSE HE WAS PURSUING DEPRESSES HIS HEAD
A BIT AND STRIKES A LONG SOFT FOOTED TROT THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH
GLANCING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT YOU FROM TIME TO TIME TILL HE IS ABOUT
OUT OF EASY PISTOL RANGE AND THEN HE STOPS AND TAKES A DELIBERATE SURVEY
OF YOU HE WILL TROT FIFTY YARDS AND STOP AGAIN ANOTHER FIFTY AND STOP
AGAIN AND FINALLY THE GRAY OF HIS GLIDING BODY BLENDS WITH THE GRAY OF
THE SAGE BRUSH AND HE DISAPPEARS
ALL THIS IS WHEN YOU MAKE NO
DEMONSTRATION AGAINST HIM BUT IF YOU DO HE DEVELOPS A LIVELIER INTEREST
IN HIS JOURNEY AND INSTANTLY ELECTRIFIES HIS HEELS AND PUTS SUCH A DEAL
OF REAL ESTATE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND YOUR WEAPON THAT BY THE TIME YOU HAVE
RAISED THE HAMMER YOU SEE THAT YOU NEED A MINIE RIFLE AND BY THE TIME
YOU HAVE GOT HIM IN LINE YOU NEED A RIFLED CANNON AND BY THE TIME YOU
HAVE DRAWN A BEAD ON HIM YOU SEE WELL ENOUGH THAT NOTHING BUT AN
UNUSUALLY LONG WINDED STREAK OF LIGHTNING COULD REACH HIM WHERE HE IS
NOW
BUT IF YOU START A SWIFT FOOTED DOG AFTER HIM YOU WILL ENJOY IT
EVER SO MUCH ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A DOG THAT HAS A GOOD OPINION OF
HIMSELF AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP TO THINK HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT SPEED
THE CAYOTE WILL GO SWINGING GENTLY OFF ON THAT DECEITFUL TROT OF HIS AND
EVERY LITTLE WHILE HE WILL SMILE A FRAUDFUL SMILE OVER HIS SHOULDER THAT
WILL FILL THAT DOG ENTIRELY FULL OF ENCOURAGEMENT AND WORLDLY AMBITION
AND MAKE HIM LAY HIS HEAD STILL LOWER TO THE GROUND AND STRETCH HIS NECK
FURTHER TO THE FRONT AND PANT MORE FIERCELY AND STICK HIS TAIL OUT
STRAIGHTER BEHIND AND MOVE HIS FURIOUS LEGS WITH A YET WILDER FRENZY
AND LEAVE A BROADER AND BROADER AND HIGHER AND DENSER CLOUD OF DESERT
SAND SMOKING BEHIND AND MARKING HIS LONG WAKE ACROSS THE LEVEL PLAIN
AND ALL THIS TIME THE DOG IS ONLY A SHORT TWENTY FEET BEHIND THE CAYOTE
AND TO SAVE THE SOUL OF HIM HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS THAT HE CANNOT
GET PERCEPTIBLY CLOSER AND HE BEGINS TO GET AGGRAVATED AND IT MAKES HIM
MADDER AND MADDER TO SEE HOW GENTLY THE CAYOTE GLIDES ALONG AND NEVER
PANTS OR SWEATS OR CEASES TO SMILE AND HE GROWS STILL MORE AND MORE
INCENSED TO SEE HOW SHAMEFULLY HE HAS BEEN TAKEN IN BY AN ENTIRE
STRANGER AND WHAT AN IGNOBLE SWINDLE THAT LONG CALM SOFT FOOTED TROT
IS AND NEXT HE NOTICES THAT HE IS GETTING FAGGED AND THAT THE CAYOTE
ACTUALLY HAS TO SLACKEN SPEED A LITTLE TO KEEP FROM RUNNING AWAY FROM
HIM AND THEN THAT TOWN DOG IS MAD IN EARNEST AND HE BEGINS TO STRAIN
AND WEEP AND SWEAR AND PAW THE SAND HIGHER THAN EVER AND REACH FOR THE
CAYOTE WITH CONCENTRATED AND DESPERATE ENERGY
THIS SPURT FINDS HIM
SIX FEET BEHIND THE GLIDING ENEMY AND TWO MILES FROM HIS FRIENDS
AND
THEN IN THE INSTANT THAT A WILD NEW HOPE IS LIGHTING UP HIS FACE THE
CAYOTE TURNS AND SMILES BLANDLY UPON HIM ONCE MORE AND WITH A SOMETHING
ABOUT IT WHICH SEEMS TO SAY WELL I SHALL HAVE TO TEAR MYSELF AWAY FROM
YOU BUB BUSINESS IS BUSINESS AND IT WILL NOT DO FOR ME TO BE FOOLING
ALONG THIS WAY ALL DAY AND FORTHWITH THERE IS A RUSHING SOUND AND THE
SUDDEN SPLITTING OF A LONG CRACK THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE AND BEHOLD THAT
DOG IS SOLITARY AND ALONE IN THE MIDST OF A VAST SOLITUDE
IT MAKES HIS HEAD SWIM
HE STOPS AND LOOKS ALL AROUND CLIMBS THE
NEAREST SAND MOUND AND GAZES INTO THE DISTANCE SHAKES HIS HEAD
REFLECTIVELY AND THEN WITHOUT A WORD HE TURNS AND JOGS ALONG BACK TO
HIS TRAIN AND TAKES UP A HUMBLE POSITION UNDER THE HINDMOST WAGON AND
FEELS UNSPEAKABLY MEAN AND LOOKS ASHAMED AND HANGS HIS TAIL AT
HALF MAST FOR A WEEK
AND FOR AS MUCH AS A YEAR AFTER THAT WHENEVER
THERE IS A GREAT HUE AND CRY AFTER A CAYOTE THAT DOG WILL MERELY GLANCE
IN THAT DIRECTION WITHOUT EMOTION AND APPARENTLY OBSERVE TO HIMSELF
I BELIEVE I DO NOT WISH ANY OF THE PIE
THE CAYOTE LIVES CHIEFLY IN THE MOST DESOLATE AND FORBIDDING DESERT
ALONG WITH THE LIZARD THE JACKASS RABBIT AND THE RAVEN AND GETS AN
UNCERTAIN AND PRECARIOUS LIVING AND EARNS IT
HE SEEMS TO SUBSIST
ALMOST WHOLLY ON THE CARCASES OF OXEN MULES AND HORSES THAT HAVE DROPPED
OUT OF EMIGRANT TRAINS AND DIED AND UPON WINDFALLS OF CARRION AND
OCCASIONAL LEGACIES OF OFFAL BEQUEATHED TO HIM BY WHITE MEN WHO HAVE BEEN
OPULENT ENOUGH TO HAVE SOMETHING BETTER TO BUTCHER THAN CONDEMNED ARMY
BACON
HE WILL EAT ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAT HIS FIRST COUSINS THE
DESERT FREQUENTING TRIBES OF INDIANS WILL AND THEY WILL EAT ANYTHING
THEY CAN BITE
IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THESE LATTER ARE THE ONLY
CREATURES KNOWN TO HISTORY WHO WILL EAT NITRO GLYCERINE AND ASK FOR MORE
IF THEY SURVIVE
THE CAYOTE OF THE DESERTS BEYOND THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS HAS A PECULIARLY
HARD TIME OF IT OWING TO THE FACT THAT HIS RELATIONS THE INDIANS ARE
JUST AS APT TO BE THE FIRST TO DETECT A SEDUCTIVE SCENT ON THE DESERT
BREEZE AND FOLLOW THE FRAGRANCE TO THE LATE OX IT EMANATED FROM AS HE
IS HIMSELF AND WHEN THIS OCCURS HE HAS TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH SITTING
OFF AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WATCHING THOSE PEOPLE STRIP OFF AND DIG OUT
EVERYTHING EDIBLE AND WALK OFF WITH IT
THEN HE AND THE WAITING RAVENS
EXPLORE THE SKELETON AND POLISH THE BONES
IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE
CAYOTE AND THE OBSCENE BIRD AND THE INDIAN OF THE DESERT TESTIFY THEIR
BLOOD KINSHIP WITH EACH OTHER IN THAT THEY LIVE TOGETHER IN THE WASTE
PLACES OF THE EARTH ON TERMS OF PERFECT CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP WHILE
HATING ALL OTHER CREATURE AND YEARNING TO ASSIST AT THEIR FUNERALS
HE
DOES NOT MIND GOING A HUNDRED MILES TO BREAKFAST AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
TO DINNER BECAUSE HE IS SURE TO HAVE THREE OR FOUR DAYS BETWEEN MEALS
AND HE CAN JUST AS WELL BE TRAVELING AND LOOKING AT THE SCENERY AS LYING
AROUND DOING NOTHING AND ADDING TO THE BURDENS OF HIS PARENTS
WE SOON LEARNED TO RECOGNIZE THE SHARP VICIOUS BARK OF THE CAYOTE AS IT
CAME ACROSS THE MURKY PLAIN AT NIGHT TO DISTURB OUR DREAMS AMONG THE
MAIL SACKS AND REMEMBERING HIS FORLORN ASPECT AND HIS HARD FORTUNE MADE
SHIFT TO WISH HIM THE BLESSED NOVELTY OF A LONG DAY'S GOOD LUCK AND A
LIMITLESS LARDER THE MORROW
CHAPTER VI
OUR NEW CONDUCTOR JUST SHIPPED HAD BEEN WITHOUT SLEEP FOR TWENTY HOURS
SUCH A THING WAS VERY FREQUENT
FROM ST
JOSEPH MISSOURI TO
SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA BY STAGE COACH WAS NEARLY NINETEEN HUNDRED
MILES AND THE TRIP WAS OFTEN MADE IN FIFTEEN DAYS THE CARS DO IT IN
FOUR AND A HALF NOW BUT THE TIME SPECIFIED IN THE MAIL CONTRACTS AND
REQUIRED BY THE SCHEDULE WAS EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN DAYS IF I REMEMBER
RIGHTLY
THIS WAS TO MAKE FAIR ALLOWANCE FOR WINTER STORMS AND SNOWS
AND OTHER UNAVOIDABLE CAUSES OF DETENTION
THE STAGE COMPANY HAD
EVERYTHING UNDER STRICT DISCIPLINE AND GOOD SYSTEM
OVER EACH TWO
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES OF ROAD THEY PLACED AN AGENT OR SUPERINTENDENT
AND INVESTED HIM WITH GREAT AUTHORITY
HIS BEAT OR JURISDICTION OF TWO
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES WAS CALLED A DIVISION HE PURCHASED HORSES
MULES HARNESS AND FOOD FOR MEN AND BEASTS AND DISTRIBUTED THESE THINGS
AMONG HIS STAGE STATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME ACCORDING TO HIS JUDGMENT OF
WHAT EACH STATION NEEDED
HE ERECTED STATION BUILDINGS AND DUG WELLS
HE ATTENDED TO THE PAYING OF THE STATION KEEPERS HOSTLERS DRIVERS AND
BLACKSMITHS AND DISCHARGED THEM WHENEVER HE CHOSE
HE WAS A VERY VERY
GREAT MAN IN HIS DIVISION A KIND OF GRAND MOGUL A SULTAN OF THE
INDIES IN WHOSE PRESENCE COMMON MEN WERE MODEST OF SPEECH AND MANNER
AND IN THE GLARE OF WHOSE GREATNESS EVEN THE DAZZLING STAGE DRIVER
DWINDLED TO A PENNY DIP
THERE WERE ABOUT EIGHT OF THESE KINGS ALL
TOLD ON THE OVERLAND ROUTE
NEXT IN RANK AND IMPORTANCE TO THE DIVISION AGENT CAME THE CONDUCTOR
HIS BEAT WAS THE SAME LENGTH AS THE AGENT'S TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
HE SAT WITH THE DRIVER AND WHEN NECESSARY RODE THAT FEARFUL DISTANCE
NIGHT AND DAY WITHOUT OTHER REST OR SLEEP THAN WHAT HE COULD GET PERCHED
THUS ON TOP OF THE FLYING VEHICLE
THINK OF IT HE HAD ABSOLUTE CHARGE
OF THE MAILS EXPRESS MATTER PASSENGERS AND STAGE COACH UNTIL HE
DELIVERED THEM TO THE NEXT CONDUCTOR AND GOT HIS RECEIPT FOR THEM
CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD TO BE A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE DECISION AND
CONSIDERABLE EXECUTIVE ABILITY
HE WAS USUALLY A QUIET PLEASANT MAN
WHO ATTENDED CLOSELY TO HIS DUTIES AND WAS A GOOD DEAL OF A GENTLEMAN
IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT THE DIVISION AGENT SHOULD BE A
GENTLEMAN AND OCCASIONALLY HE WASN'T
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS A GENERAL IN
ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY AND A BULL DOG IN COURAGE AND DETERMINATION
OTHERWISE THE CHIEFTAINSHIP OVER THE LAWLESS UNDERLINGS OF THE OVERLAND
SERVICE WOULD NEVER IN ANY INSTANCE HAVE BEEN TO HIM ANYTHING BUT AN
EQUIVALENT FOR A MONTH OF INSOLENCE AND DISTRESS AND A BULLET AND A
COFFIN AT THE END OF IT
THERE WERE ABOUT SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CONDUCTORS
ON THE OVERLAND FOR THERE WAS A DAILY STAGE EACH WAY AND A CONDUCTOR ON
EVERY STAGE
NEXT IN REAL AND OFFICIAL RANK AND IMPORTANCE AFTER THE CONDUCTOR CAME
MY DELIGHT THE DRIVER NEXT IN REAL BUT NOT IN APPARENT IMPORTANCE FOR
WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN THE EYES OF THE COMMON HERD THE DRIVER WAS TO THE
CONDUCTOR AS AN ADMIRAL IS TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE FLAG SHIP
THE DRIVER'S
BEAT WAS PRETTY LONG AND HIS SLEEPING TIME AT THE STATIONS PRETTY SHORT
SOMETIMES AND SO BUT FOR THE GRANDEUR OF HIS POSITION HIS WOULD HAVE
BEEN A SORRY LIFE AS WELL AS A HARD AND A WEARING ONE
WE TOOK A NEW
DRIVER EVERY DAY OR EVERY NIGHT FOR THEY DROVE BACKWARD AND FORWARD OVER
THE SAME PIECE OF ROAD ALL THE TIME AND THEREFORE WE NEVER GOT AS WELL
ACQUAINTED WITH THEM AS WE DID WITH THE CONDUCTORS AND BESIDES THEY
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOVE BEING FAMILIAR WITH SUCH RUBBISH AS PASSENGERS
ANYHOW AS A GENERAL THING
STILL WE WERE ALWAYS EAGER TO GET A SIGHT
OF EACH AND EVERY NEW DRIVER AS SOON AS THE WATCH CHANGED FOR EACH AND
EVERY DAY WE WERE EITHER ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF AN UNPLEASANT ONE OR
LOATH TO PART WITH A DRIVER WE HAD LEARNED TO LIKE AND HAD COME TO BE
SOCIABLE AND FRIENDLY WITH
AND SO THE FIRST QUESTION WE ASKED THE
CONDUCTOR WHENEVER WE GOT TO WHERE WE WERE TO EXCHANGE DRIVERS WAS
ALWAYS WHICH IS HIM THE GRAMMAR WAS FAULTY MAYBE BUT WE COULD NOT
KNOW THEN THAT IT WOULD GO INTO A BOOK SOME DAY
AS LONG AS EVERYTHING
WENT SMOOTHLY THE OVERLAND DRIVER WAS WELL ENOUGH SITUATED BUT IF A
FELLOW DRIVER GOT SICK SUDDENLY IT MADE TROUBLE FOR THE COACH MUST GO
ON AND SO THE POTENTATE WHO WAS ABOUT TO CLIMB DOWN AND TAKE A LUXURIOUS
REST AFTER HIS LONG NIGHT'S SIEGE IN THE MIDST OF WIND AND RAIN AND
DARKNESS HAD TO STAY WHERE HE WAS AND DO THE SICK MAN'S WORK
ONCE IN
THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHEN I FOUND A DRIVER SOUND ASLEEP ON THE BOX AND
THE MULES GOING AT THE USUAL BREAK NECK PACE THE CONDUCTOR SAID NEVER
MIND HIM THERE WAS NO DANGER AND HE WAS DOING DOUBLE DUTY HAD DRIVEN
SEVENTY FIVE MILES ON ONE COACH AND WAS NOW GOING BACK OVER IT ON THIS
WITHOUT REST OR SLEEP
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES OF HOLDING BACK OF SIX
VINDICTIVE MULES AND KEEPING THEM FROM CLIMBING THE TREES IT SOUNDS
INCREDIBLE BUT I REMEMBER THE STATEMENT WELL ENOUGH
THE STATION KEEPERS HOSTLERS ETC WERE LOW ROUGH CHARACTERS AS
ALREADY DESCRIBED AND FROM WESTERN NEBRASKA TO NEVADA A CONSIDERABLE
SPRINKLING OF THEM MIGHT BE FAIRLY SET DOWN AS OUTLAWS FUGITIVES FROM
JUSTICE CRIMINALS WHOSE BEST SECURITY WAS A SECTION OF COUNTRY WHICH WAS
WITHOUT LAW AND WITHOUT EVEN THE PRETENCE OF IT
WHEN THE
DIVISION AGENT ISSUED AN ORDER TO ONE OF THESE PARTIES HE DID IT WITH
THE FULL UNDERSTANDING THAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO ENFORCE IT WITH A NAVY
SIX SHOOTER AND SO HE ALWAYS WENT FIXED TO MAKE THINGS GO ALONG
SMOOTHLY
NOW AND THEN A DIVISION AGENT WAS REALLY OBLIGED TO SHOOT A HOSTLER
THROUGH THE HEAD TO TEACH HIM SOME SIMPLE MATTER THAT HE COULD HAVE
TAUGHT HIM WITH A CLUB IF HIS CIRCUMSTANCES AND SURROUNDINGS HAD BEEN
DIFFERENT
BUT THEY WERE SNAPPY ABLE MEN THOSE DIVISION AGENTS AND
WHEN THEY TRIED TO TEACH A SUBORDINATE ANYTHING THAT SUBORDINATE
GENERALLY GOT IT THROUGH HIS HEAD
A GREAT PORTION OF THIS VAST MACHINERY THESE HUNDREDS OF MEN AND
COACHES AND THOUSANDS OF MULES AND HORSES WAS IN THE HANDS OF MR
BEN
HOLLIDAY
ALL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE BUSINESS WAS IN HIS HANDS
THIS
REMINDS ME OF AN INCIDENT OF PALESTINE TRAVEL WHICH IS PERTINENT HERE SO
I WILL TRANSFER IT JUST IN THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH I FIND IT SET DOWN IN MY
HOLY LAND NOTE BOOK
NO DOUBT EVERYBODY HAS HEARD OF BEN HOLLIDAY A MAN OF PRODIGIOUS
ENERGY WHO USED TO SEND MAILS AND PASSENGERS FLYING ACROSS THE
CONTINENT IN HIS OVERLAND STAGE COACHES LIKE A VERY WHIRLWIND TWO
THOUSAND LONG MILES IN FIFTEEN DAYS AND A HALF BY THE WATCH BUT
THIS FRAGMENT OF HISTORY IS NOT ABOUT BEN HOLLIDAY BUT ABOUT A
YOUNG NEW YORK BOY BY THE NAME OF JACK WHO TRAVELED WITH OUR SMALL
PARTY OF PILGRIMS IN THE HOLY LAND AND WHO HAD TRAVELED TO
CALIFORNIA IN MR
HOLLIDAY'S OVERLAND COACHES THREE YEARS BEFORE
AND HAD BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN IT OR LOST HIS GUSHING ADMIRATION OF
MR
H AGED NINETEEN
JACK WAS A GOOD BOY A GOOD HEARTED AND
ALWAYS WELL MEANING BOY WHO HAD BEEN REARED IN THE CITY OF NEW
YORK AND ALTHOUGH HE WAS BRIGHT AND KNEW A GREAT MANY USEFUL
THINGS HIS SCRIPTURAL EDUCATION HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL NEGLECTED TO
SUCH A DEGREE INDEED THAT ALL HOLY LAND HISTORY WAS FRESH AND NEW
TO HIM AND ALL BIBLE NAMES MYSTERIES THAT HAD NEVER DISTURBED HIS
VIRGIN EAR
ALSO IN OUR PARTY WAS AN ELDERLY PILGRIM WHO WAS THE REVERSE OF
JACK IN THAT HE WAS LEARNED IN THE SCRIPTURES AND AN ENTHUSIAST
CONCERNING THEM
HE WAS OUR ENCYCLOPEDIA AND WE WERE NEVER TIRED
OF LISTENING TO HIS SPEECHES NOR HE OF MAKING THEM
HE NEVER
PASSED A CELEBRATED LOCALITY FROM BASHAN TO BETHLEHEM WITHOUT
ILLUMINATING IT WITH AN ORATION
ONE DAY WHEN CAMPED NEAR THE
RUINS OF JERICHO HE BURST FORTH WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS
JACK DO YOU SEE THAT RANGE OF MOUNTAINS OVER YONDER THAT BOUNDS
THE JORDAN VALLEY THE MOUNTAINS OF MOAB JACK THINK OF IT MY
BOY THE ACTUAL MOUNTAINS OF MOAB RENOWNED IN SCRIPTURE HISTORY
WE ARE ACTUALLY STANDING FACE TO FACE WITH THOSE ILLUSTRIOUS CRAGS
AND PEAKS AND FOR ALL WE KNOW DROPPING HIS VOICE IMPRESSIVELY
OUR EYES MAY BE RESTING AT THIS VERY MOMENT UPON THE SPOT WHERE
LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES THINK OF IT JACK
MOSES WHO FALLING INFLECTION
MOSES WHO JACK YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF YOU OUGHT TO
BE ASHAMED OF SUCH CRIMINAL IGNORANCE
WHY MOSES THE GREAT GUIDE
SOLDIER POET LAWGIVER OF ANCIENT ISRAEL JACK FROM THIS SPOT
WHERE WE STAND TO EGYPT STRETCHES A FEARFUL DESERT THREE HUNDRED
MILES IN EXTENT AND ACROSS THAT DESERT THAT WONDERFUL MAN BROUGHT
THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL GUIDING THEM WITH UNFAILING SAGACITY FOR
FORTY YEARS OVER THE SANDY DESOLATION AND AMONG THE OBSTRUCTING
ROCKS AND HILLS AND LANDED THEM AT LAST SAFE AND SOUND WITHIN
SIGHT OF THIS VERY SPOT AND WHERE WE NOW STAND THEY ENTERED THE
PROMISED LAND WITH ANTHEMS OF REJOICING IT WAS A WONDERFUL
WONDERFUL THING TO DO JACK THINK OF IT
FORTY YEARS ONLY THREE HUNDRED MILES HUMPH BEN HOLLIDAY WOULD
HAVE FETCHED THEM THROUGH IN THIRTY SIX HOURS
THE BOY MEANT NO HARM
HE DID NOT KNOW THAT HE HAD SAID ANYTHING THAT
WAS WRONG OR IRREVERENT
AND SO NO ONE SCOLDED HIM OR FELT OFFENDED WITH
HIM AND NOBODY COULD BUT SOME UNGENEROUS SPIRIT INCAPABLE OF EXCUSING
THE HEEDLESS BLUNDERS OF A BOY
AT NOON ON THE FIFTH DAY OUT WE ARRIVED AT THE CROSSING OF THE SOUTH
PLATTE ALIAS JULESBURG ALIAS OVERLAND CITY FOUR HUNDRED AND
SEVENTY MILES FROM ST
JOSEPH THE STRANGEST QUAINTEST FUNNIEST
FRONTIER TOWN THAT OUR UNTRAVELED EYES HAD EVER STARED AT AND BEEN
ASTONISHED WITH
CHAPTER VII
IT DID SEEM STRANGE ENOUGH TO SEE A TOWN AGAIN AFTER WHAT APPEARED TO US
SUCH A LONG ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP STILL ALMOST LIFELESS AND HOUSELESS
SOLITUDE WE TUMBLED OUT INTO THE BUSY STREET FEELING LIKE METEORIC
PEOPLE CRUMBLED OFF THE CORNER OF SOME OTHER WORLD AND WAKENED UP
SUDDENLY IN THIS
FOR AN HOUR WE TOOK AS MUCH INTEREST IN OVERLAND CITY
AS IF WE HAD NEVER SEEN A TOWN BEFORE
THE REASON WE HAD AN HOUR TO
SPARE WAS BECAUSE WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR STAGE FOR A LESS SUMPTUOUS
AFFAIR CALLED A MUD WAGON AND TRANSFER OUR FREIGHT OF MAILS
PRESENTLY WE GOT UNDER WAY AGAIN
WE CAME TO THE SHALLOW YELLOW MUDDY
SOUTH PLATTE WITH ITS LOW BANKS AND ITS SCATTERING FLAT SAND BARS AND
PIGMY ISLANDS A MELANCHOLY STREAM STRAGGLING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE
ENORMOUS FLAT PLAIN AND ONLY SAVED FROM BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND WITH
THE NAKED EYE BY ITS SENTINEL RANK OF SCATTERING TREES STANDING ON EITHER
BANK
THE PLATTE WAS UP THEY SAID WHICH MADE ME WISH I COULD SEE IT
WHEN IT WAS DOWN IF IT COULD LOOK ANY SICKER AND SORRIER
THEY SAID IT
WAS A DANGEROUS STREAM TO CROSS NOW BECAUSE ITS QUICKSANDS WERE LIABLE
TO SWALLOW UP HORSES COACH AND PASSENGERS IF AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO FORD
IT
BUT THE MAILS HAD TO GO AND WE MADE THE ATTEMPT
ONCE OR TWICE IN
MIDSTREAM THE WHEELS SUNK INTO THE YIELDING SANDS SO THREATENINGLY THAT
WE HALF BELIEVED WE HAD DREADED AND AVOIDED THE SEA ALL OUR LIVES TO BE
SHIPWRECKED IN A MUD WAGON IN THE MIDDLE OF A DESERT AT LAST
BUT WE
DRAGGED THROUGH AND SPED AWAY TOWARD THE SETTING SUN
NEXT MORNING JUST BEFORE DAWN WHEN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES
FROM ST
JOSEPH OUR MUD WAGON BROKE DOWN
WE WERE TO BE DELAYED FIVE OR
SIX HOURS AND THEREFORE WE TOOK HORSES BY INVITATION AND JOINED A
PARTY WHO WERE JUST STARTING ON A BUFFALO HUNT
IT WAS NOBLE SPORT
GALLOPING OVER THE PLAIN IN THE DEWY FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING BUT OUR
PART OF THE HUNT ENDED IN DISASTER AND DISGRACE FOR A WOUNDED BUFFALO
BULL CHASED THE PASSENGER BEMIS NEARLY TWO MILES AND THEN HE FORSOOK HIS
HORSE AND TOOK TO A LONE TREE
HE WAS VERY SULLEN ABOUT THE MATTER FOR
SOME TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT AT LAST HE BEGAN TO SOFTEN LITTLE BY LITTLE
AND FINALLY HE SAID
WELL IT WAS NOT FUNNY AND THERE WAS NO SENSE IN THOSE GAWKS MAKING
THEMSELVES SO FACETIOUS OVER IT
I TELL YOU I WAS ANGRY IN EARNEST FOR
AWHILE
I SHOULD HAVE SHOT THAT LONG GANGLY LUBBER THEY CALLED HANK IF
I COULD HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT CRIPPLING SIX OR SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE BUT OF
COURSE I COULDN'T THE OLD 'ALLEN'S' SO CONFOUNDED COMPREHENSIVE
I WISH
THOSE LOAFERS HAD BEEN UP IN THE TREE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO LAUGH
SO
IF I HAD HAD A HORSE WORTH A CENT BUT NO THE MINUTE HE SAW THAT
BUFFALO BULL WHEEL ON HIM AND GIVE A BELLOW HE RAISED STRAIGHT UP IN THE
AIR AND STOOD ON HIS HEELS
THE SADDLE BEGAN TO SLIP AND I TOOK HIM
ROUND THE NECK AND LAID CLOSE TO HIM AND BEGAN TO PRAY
THEN HE CAME
DOWN AND STOOD UP ON THE OTHER END AWHILE AND THE BULL ACTUALLY STOPPED
PAWING SAND AND BELLOWING TO CONTEMPLATE THE INHUMAN SPECTACLE
THEN THE BULL MADE A PASS AT HIM AND UTTERED A BELLOW THAT SOUNDED
PERFECTLY FRIGHTFUL IT WAS SO CLOSE TO ME AND THAT SEEMED TO LITERALLY
PROSTRATE MY HORSE'S REASON AND MAKE A RAVING DISTRACTED MANIAC OF HIM
AND I WISH I MAY DIE IF HE DIDN'T STAND ON HIS HEAD FOR A QUARTER OF A
MINUTE AND SHED TEARS
HE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF HIS MIND HE WAS AS
SURE AS TRUTH ITSELF AND HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING
THEN
THE BULL CAME CHARGING AT US AND MY HORSE DROPPED DOWN ON ALL FOURS AND
TOOK A FRESH START AND THEN FOR THE NEXT TEN MINUTES HE WOULD ACTUALLY
THROW ONE HAND SPRING AFTER ANOTHER SO FAST THAT THE BULL BEGAN TO GET
UNSETTLED TOO AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO START IN AND SO HE STOOD THERE
SNEEZING AND SHOVELLING DUST OVER HIS BACK AND BELLOWING EVERY NOW AND
THEN AND THINKING HE HAD GOT A FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR CIRCUS HORSE FOR
BREAKFAST CERTAIN
WELL I WAS FIRST OUT ON HIS NECK THE HORSE'S NOT
THE BULL'S AND THEN UNDERNEATH AND NEXT ON HIS RUMP AND SOMETIMES HEAD
UP AND SOMETIMES HEELS BUT I TELL YOU IT SEEMED SOLEMN AND AWFUL TO BE
RIPPING AND TEARING AND CARRYING ON SO IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH AS YOU
MIGHT SAY
PRETTY SOON THE BULL MADE A SNATCH FOR US AND BROUGHT AWAY
SOME OF MY HORSE'S TAIL I SUPPOSE BUT DO NOT KNOW BEING PRETTY BUSY AT
THE TIME BUT SOMETHING MADE HIM HUNGRY FOR SOLITUDE AND SUGGESTED TO
HIM TO GET UP AND HUNT FOR IT
AND THEN YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THAT SPIDER LEGGED OLD SKELETON GO AND
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN THE BULL CUT OUT AFTER HIM TOO HEAD DOWN TONGUE
OUT TAIL UP BELLOWING LIKE EVERYTHING AND ACTUALLY MOWING DOWN THE
WEEDS AND TEARING UP THE EARTH AND BOOSTING UP THE SAND LIKE A
WHIRLWIND BY GEORGE IT WAS A HOT RACE I AND THE SADDLE WERE BACK ON
THE RUMP AND I HAD THE BRIDLE IN MY TEETH AND HOLDING ON TO THE POMMEL
WITH BOTH HANDS
FIRST WE LEFT THE DOGS BEHIND THEN WE PASSED A JACKASS
RABBIT THEN WE OVERTOOK A CAYOTE AND WERE GAINING ON AN ANTELOPE WHEN
THE ROTTEN GIRTH LET GO AND THREW ME ABOUT THIRTY YARDS OFF TO THE LEFT
AND AS THE SADDLE WENT DOWN OVER THE HORSE'S RUMP HE GAVE IT A LIFT WITH
HIS HEELS THAT SENT IT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YARDS UP IN THE AIR I WISH
I MAY DIE IN A MINUTE IF HE DIDN'T
I FELL AT THE FOOT OF THE ONLY
SOLITARY TREE THERE WAS IN NINE COUNTIES ADJACENT AS ANY CREATURE COULD
SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE AND THE NEXT SECOND I HAD HOLD OF THE BARK WITH
FOUR SETS OF NAILS AND MY TEETH AND THE NEXT SECOND AFTER THAT I WAS
ASTRADDLE OF THE MAIN LIMB AND BLASPHEMING MY LUCK IN A WAY THAT MADE MY
BREATH SMELL OF BRIMSTONE
I HAD THE BULL NOW IF HE DID NOT THINK OF
ONE THING
BUT THAT ONE THING I DREADED
I DREADED IT VERY SERIOUSLY
THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE BULL MIGHT NOT THINK OF IT BUT THERE
WERE GREATER CHANCES THAT HE WOULD
I MADE UP MY MIND WHAT I WOULD DO IN
CASE HE DID
IT WAS A LITTLE OVER FORTY FEET TO THE GROUND FROM WHERE I
SAT
I CAUTIOUSLY UNWOUND THE LARIAT FROM THE POMMEL OF MY SADDLE
YOUR SADDLE DID YOU TAKE YOUR SADDLE UP IN THE TREE WITH YOU
TAKE IT UP IN THE TREE WITH ME WHY HOW YOU TALK
OF COURSE I DIDN'T
NO MAN COULD DO THAT
IT FELL IN THE TREE WHEN IT CAME DOWN
OH EXACTLY
CERTAINLY
I UNWOUND THE LARIAT AND FASTENED ONE END OF IT TO THE
LIMB
IT WAS THE VERY BEST GREEN RAW HIDE AND CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING
TONS
I MADE A SLIP NOOSE IN THE OTHER END AND THEN HUNG IT DOWN TO SEE
THE LENGTH
IT REACHED DOWN TWENTY TWO FEET HALF WAY TO THE GROUND
I THEN LOADED EVERY BARREL OF THE ALLEN WITH A DOUBLE CHARGE
I FELT
SATISFIED
I SAID TO MYSELF IF HE NEVER THINKS OF THAT ONE THING THAT I
DREAD ALL RIGHT BUT IF HE DOES ALL RIGHT ANYHOW I AM FIXED FOR HIM
BUT DON'T YOU KNOW THAT THE VERY THING A MAN DREADS IS THE THING THAT
ALWAYS HAPPENS INDEED IT IS SO
I WATCHED THE BULL NOW WITH ANXIETY
ANXIETY WHICH NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE OF WHO HAS NOT BEEN IN SUCH A
SITUATION AND FELT THAT AT ANY MOMENT DEATH MIGHT COME
PRESENTLY A
THOUGHT CAME INTO THE BULL'S EYE
I KNEW IT SAID I IF MY NERVE FAILS
NOW I AM LOST
SURE ENOUGH IT WAS JUST AS I HAD DREADED HE STARTED IN
TO CLIMB THE TREE
WHAT THE BULL
OF COURSE WHO ELSE
BUT A BULL CAN'T CLIMB A TREE
HE CAN'T CAN'T HE SINCE YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT DID YOU EVER SEE A
BULL TRY
NO I NEVER DREAMT OF SUCH A THING
WELL THEN WHAT IS THE USE OF YOUR TALKING THAT WAY THEN BECAUSE YOU
NEVER SAW A THING DONE IS THAT ANY REASON WHY IT CAN'T BE DONE
WELL ALL RIGHT GO ON
WHAT DID YOU DO
THE BULL STARTED UP AND GOT ALONG WELL FOR ABOUT TEN FEET THEN SLIPPED
AND SLID BACK
I BREATHED EASIER
HE TRIED IT AGAIN GOT UP A LITTLE
HIGHER SLIPPED AGAIN
BUT HE CAME AT IT ONCE MORE AND THIS TIME HE WAS
CAREFUL
HE GOT GRADUALLY HIGHER AND HIGHER AND MY SPIRITS WENT DOWN
MORE AND MORE
UP HE CAME AN INCH AT A TIME WITH HIS EYES HOT AND HIS
TONGUE HANGING OUT
HIGHER AND HIGHER HITCHED HIS FOOT OVER THE STUMP
OF A LIMB AND LOOKED UP AS MUCH AS TO SAY 'YOU ARE MY MEAT FRIEND
UP AGAIN HIGHER AND HIGHER AND GETTING MORE EXCITED THE CLOSER HE GOT
HE WAS WITHIN TEN FEET OF ME I TOOK A LONG BREATH AND THEN SAID I
'IT IS NOW OR NEVER I HAD THE COIL OF THE LARIAT ALL READY I PAID IT
OUT SLOWLY TILL IT HUNG RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD ALL OF A SUDDEN I LET GO OF
THE SLACK AND THE SLIPNOOSE FELL FAIRLY ROUND HIS NECK QUICKER THAN
LIGHTNING I OUT WITH THE ALLEN AND LET HIM HAVE IT IN THE FACE
IT WAS
AN AWFUL ROAR AND MUST HAVE SCARED THE BULL OUT OF HIS SENSES
WHEN THE
SMOKE CLEARED AWAY THERE HE WAS DANGLING IN THE AIR TWENTY FOOT FROM
THE GROUND AND GOING OUT OF ONE CONVULSION INTO ANOTHER FASTER THAN YOU
COULD COUNT I DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT ANYHOW I SHINNED DOWN THE TREE AND
SHOT FOR HOME
BEMIS IS ALL THAT TRUE JUST AS YOU HAVE STATED IT
I WISH I MAY ROT IN MY TRACKS AND DIE THE DEATH OF A DOG IF IT ISN'T
WELL WE CAN'T REFUSE TO BELIEVE IT AND WE DON'T
BUT IF THERE WERE
SOME PROOFS
PROOFS DID I BRING BACK MY LARIAT
NO
DID I BRING BACK MY HORSE
NO
DID YOU EVER SEE THE BULL AGAIN
NO
WELL THEN WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY AS PARTICULAR AS
YOU ARE ABOUT A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT
I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF THIS MAN WAS NOT A LIAR HE ONLY MISSED IT BY
THE SKIN OF HIS TEETH
THIS EPISODE REMINDS ME OF AN INCIDENT OF MY
BRIEF SOJOURN IN SIAM YEARS AFTERWARD
THE EUROPEAN CITIZENS OF A TOWN
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BANGKOK HAD A PRODIGY AMONG THEM BY THE NAME OF
ECKERT AN ENGLISHMAN A PERSON FAMOUS FOR THE NUMBER INGENUITY AND
IMPOSING MAGNITUDE OF HIS LIES
THEY WERE ALWAYS REPEATING HIS MOST
CELEBRATED FALSEHOODS AND ALWAYS TRYING TO DRAW HIM OUT BEFORE
STRANGERS BUT THEY SELDOM SUCCEEDED
TWICE HE WAS INVITED TO THE HOUSE
WHERE I WAS VISITING BUT NOTHING COULD SEDUCE HIM INTO A SPECIMEN LIE
ONE DAY A PLANTER NAMED BASCOM AN INFLUENTIAL MAN AND A PROUD AND
SOMETIMES IRASCIBLE ONE INVITED ME TO RIDE OVER WITH HIM AND CALL ON
ECKERT
AS WE JOGGED ALONG SAID HE
NOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE FAULT LIES IT LIES IN PUTTING ECKERT ON HIS
GUARD
THE MINUTE THE BOYS GO TO PUMPING AT ECKERT HE KNOWS PERFECTLY
WELL WHAT THEY ARE AFTER AND OF COURSE HE SHUTS UP HIS SHELL
ANYBODY
MIGHT KNOW HE WOULD
BUT WHEN WE GET THERE WE MUST PLAY HIM FINER THAN
THAT
LET HIM SHAPE THE CONVERSATION TO SUIT HIMSELF LET HIM DROP IT OR
CHANGE IT WHENEVER HE WANTS TO
LET HIM SEE THAT NOBODY IS TRYING TO
DRAW HIM OUT
JUST LET HIM HAVE HIS OWN WAY
HE WILL SOON FORGET
HIMSELF AND BEGIN TO GRIND OUT LIES LIKE A MILL
DON'T GET IMPATIENT
JUST KEEP QUIET AND LET ME PLAY HIM
I WILL MAKE HIM LIE
IT DOES SEEM
TO ME THAT THE BOYS MUST BE BLIND TO OVERLOOK SUCH AN OBVIOUS AND SIMPLE
TRICK AS THAT
ECKERT RECEIVED US HEARTILY A PLEASANT SPOKEN GENTLE MANNERED CREATURE
WE SAT IN THE VERANDA AN HOUR SIPPING ENGLISH ALE AND TALKING ABOUT THE
KING AND THE SACRED WHITE ELEPHANT THE SLEEPING IDOL AND ALL MANNER OF
THINGS AND I NOTICED THAT MY COMRADE NEVER LED THE CONVERSATION HIMSELF
OR SHAPED IT BUT SIMPLY FOLLOWED ECKERT'S LEAD AND BETRAYED NO
SOLICITUDE AND NO ANXIETY ABOUT ANYTHING
THE EFFECT WAS SHORTLY
PERCEPTIBLE
ECKERT BEGAN TO GROW COMMUNICATIVE HE GREW MORE AND MORE
AT HIS EASE AND MORE AND MORE TALKATIVE AND SOCIABLE
ANOTHER HOUR
PASSED IN THE SAME WAY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ECKERT SAID
OH BY THE WAY I CAME NEAR FORGETTING
I HAVE GOT A THING HERE TO
ASTONISH YOU
SUCH A THING AS NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER MAN EVER HEARD
OF I'VE GOT A CAT THAT WILL EAT COCOANUT COMMON GREEN COCOANUT AND
NOT ONLY EAT THE MEAT BUT DRINK THE MILK
IT IS SO I'LL SWEAR TO IT
A QUICK GLANCE FROM BASCOM A GLANCE THAT I UNDERSTOOD THEN
WHY BLESS MY SOUL I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
MAN IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE
I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY IT
I'LL FETCH THE CAT
HE WENT IN THE HOUSE
BASCOM SAID
THERE WHAT DID I TELL YOU NOW THAT IS THE WAY TO HANDLE ECKERT
YOU
SEE I HAVE PETTED HIM ALONG PATIENTLY AND PUT HIS SUSPICIONS TO SLEEP
I AM GLAD WE CAME
YOU TELL THE BOYS ABOUT IT WHEN YOU GO BACK
CAT EAT
A COCOANUT OH MY NOW THAT IS JUST HIS WAY EXACTLY HE WILL TELL THE
ABSURDEST LIE AND TRUST TO LUCK TO GET OUT OF IT AGAIN
CAT EAT A COCOANUT THE INNOCENT FOOL
ECKERT APPROACHED WITH HIS CAT SURE ENOUGH
BASCOM SMILED
SAID HE
I'LL HOLD THE CAT YOU BRING A COCOANUT
ECKERT SPLIT ONE OPEN AND CHOPPED UP SOME PIECES
BASCOM SMUGGLED A
WINK TO ME AND PROFFERED A SLICE OF THE FRUIT TO PUSS
SHE SNATCHED IT
SWALLOWED IT RAVENOUSLY AND ASKED FOR MORE
WE RODE OUR TWO MILES IN SILENCE AND WIDE APART
AT LEAST I WAS SILENT
THOUGH BASCOM CUFFED HIS HORSE AND CURSED HIM A GOOD DEAL
NOTWITHSTANDING THE HORSE WAS BEHAVING WELL ENOUGH
WHEN I BRANCHED OFF
HOMEWARD BASCOM SAID
KEEP THE HORSE TILL MORNING
AND YOU NEED NOT SPEAK OF THIS
FOOLISHNESS TO THE BOYS
CHAPTER VIII
IN A LITTLE WHILE ALL INTEREST WAS TAKEN UP IN STRETCHING OUR NECKS AND
WATCHING FOR THE PONY RIDER THE FLEET MESSENGER WHO SPED ACROSS THE
CONTINENT FROM ST
JOE TO SACRAMENTO CARRYING LETTERS NINETEEN HUNDRED
MILES IN EIGHT DAYS THINK OF THAT FOR PERISHABLE HORSE AND HUMAN FLESH
AND BLOOD TO DO THE PONY RIDER WAS USUALLY A LITTLE BIT OF A MAN
BRIMFUL OF SPIRIT AND ENDURANCE
NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT
HIS WATCH CAME ON AND NO MATTER WHETHER IT WAS WINTER OR SUMMER
RAINING SNOWING HAILING OR SLEETING OR WHETHER HIS BEAT WAS A LEVEL
STRAIGHT ROAD OR A CRAZY TRAIL OVER MOUNTAIN CRAGS AND PRECIPICES OR
WHETHER IT LED THROUGH PEACEFUL REGIONS OR REGIONS THAT SWARMED WITH
HOSTILE INDIANS HE MUST BE ALWAYS READY TO LEAP INTO THE SADDLE AND BE
OFF LIKE THE WIND THERE WAS NO IDLING TIME FOR A PONY RIDER ON DUTY
HE RODE FIFTY MILES WITHOUT STOPPING BY DAYLIGHT MOONLIGHT STARLIGHT
OR THROUGH THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS JUST AS IT HAPPENED
HE RODE A
SPLENDID HORSE THAT WAS BORN FOR A RACER AND FED AND LODGED LIKE A
GENTLEMAN KEPT HIM AT HIS UTMOST SPEED FOR TEN MILES AND THEN AS HE
CAME CRASHING UP TO THE STATION WHERE STOOD TWO MEN HOLDING FAST A FRESH
IMPATIENT STEED THE TRANSFER OF RIDER AND MAIL BAG WAS MADE IN THE
TWINKLING OF AN EYE AND AWAY FLEW THE EAGER PAIR AND WERE OUT OF SIGHT
BEFORE THE SPECTATOR COULD GET HARDLY THE GHOST OF A LOOK
BOTH RIDER
AND HORSE WENT FLYING LIGHT THE RIDER'S DRESS WAS THIN AND FITTED
CLOSE HE WORE A ROUND ABOUT AND A SKULL CAP AND TUCKED HIS
PANTALOONS INTO HIS BOOT TOPS LIKE A RACE RIDER
HE CARRIED NO ARMS HE
CARRIED NOTHING THAT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR EVEN THE POSTAGE
ON HIS LITERARY FREIGHT WAS WORTH FIVE DOLLARS A LETTER
HE GOT BUT LITTLE FRIVOLOUS CORRESPONDENCE TO CARRY HIS BAG HAD BUSINESS
LETTERS IN IT MOSTLY
HIS HORSE WAS STRIPPED OF ALL UNNECESSARY WEIGHT
TOO
HE WORE A LITTLE WAFER OF A RACING SADDLE AND NO VISIBLE BLANKET
HE WORE LIGHT SHOES OR NONE AT ALL
THE LITTLE FLAT MAIL POCKETS
STRAPPED UNDER THE RIDER'S THIGHS WOULD EACH HOLD ABOUT THE BULK OF A
CHILD'S PRIMER
THEY HELD MANY AND MANY AN IMPORTANT BUSINESS CHAPTER
AND NEWSPAPER LETTER BUT THESE WERE WRITTEN ON PAPER AS AIRY AND THIN AS
GOLD LEAF NEARLY AND THUS BULK AND WEIGHT WERE ECONOMIZED
THE
STAGE COACH TRAVELED ABOUT A HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES
A DAY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE PONY RIDER ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
THERE WERE ABOUT EIGHTY PONY RIDERS IN THE SADDLE ALL THE TIME NIGHT AND
DAY STRETCHING IN A LONG SCATTERING PROCESSION FROM MISSOURI TO
CALIFORNIA FORTY FLYING EASTWARD AND FORTY TOWARD THE WEST AND AMONG
THEM MAKING FOUR HUNDRED GALLANT HORSES EARN A STIRRING LIVELIHOOD AND
SEE A DEAL OF SCENERY EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE YEAR
WE HAD HAD A CONSUMING DESIRE FROM THE BEGINNING TO SEE A PONY RIDER
BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER ALL THAT PASSED US AND ALL THAT MET US MANAGED TO
STREAK BY IN THE NIGHT AND SO WE HEARD ONLY A WHIZ AND A HAIL AND THE
SWIFT PHANTOM OF THE DESERT WAS GONE BEFORE WE COULD GET OUR HEADS OUT OF
THE WINDOWS
BUT NOW WE WERE EXPECTING ONE ALONG EVERY MOMENT AND WOULD
SEE HIM IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
PRESENTLY THE DRIVER EXCLAIMS
HERE HE COMES
EVERY NECK IS STRETCHED FURTHER AND EVERY EYE STRAINED WIDER
AWAY
ACROSS THE ENDLESS DEAD LEVEL OF THE PRAIRIE A BLACK SPECK APPEARS
AGAINST THE SKY AND IT IS PLAIN THAT IT MOVES
WELL I SHOULD THINK SO
IN A SECOND OR TWO IT BECOMES A HORSE AND RIDER RISING AND FALLING
RISING AND FALLING SWEEPING TOWARD US NEARER AND NEARER GROWING MORE
AND MORE DISTINCT MORE AND MORE SHARPLY DEFINED NEARER AND STILL
NEARER AND THE FLUTTER OF THE HOOFS COMES FAINTLY TO THE EAR ANOTHER
INSTANT A WHOOP AND A HURRAH FROM OUR UPPER DECK A WAVE OF THE RIDER'S
HAND BUT NO REPLY AND MAN AND HORSE BURST PAST OUR EXCITED FACES AND
GO WINGING AWAY LIKE A BELATED FRAGMENT OF A STORM
SO SUDDEN IS IT ALL AND SO LIKE A FLASH OF UNREAL FANCY THAT BUT FOR
THE FLAKE OF WHITE FOAM LEFT QUIVERING AND PERISHING ON A MAIL SACK AFTER
THE VISION HAD FLASHED BY AND DISAPPEARED WE MIGHT HAVE DOUBTED WHETHER
WE HAD SEEN ANY ACTUAL HORSE AND MAN AT ALL MAYBE
WE RATTLED THROUGH SCOTT'S BLUFFS PASS BY AND BY
IT WAS ALONG HERE
SOMEWHERE THAT WE FIRST CAME ACROSS GENUINE AND UNMISTAKABLE ALKALI WATER
IN THE ROAD AND WE CORDIALLY HAILED IT AS A FIRST CLASS CURIOSITY AND A
THING TO BE MENTIONED WITH ECLAT IN LETTERS TO THE IGNORANT AT HOME
THIS WATER GAVE THE ROAD A SOAPY APPEARANCE AND IN MANY PLACES THE
GROUND LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN WHITEWASHED
I THINK THE STRANGE ALKALI
WATER EXCITED US AS MUCH AS ANY WONDER WE HAD COME UPON YET AND I KNOW
WE FELT VERY COMPLACENT AND CONCEITED AND BETTER SATISFIED WITH LIFE
AFTER WE HAD ADDED IT TO OUR LIST OF THINGS WHICH WE HAD SEEN AND SOME
OTHER PEOPLE HAD NOT
IN A SMALL WAY WE WERE THE SAME SORT OF SIMPLETONS
AS THOSE WHO CLIMB UNNECESSARILY THE PERILOUS PEAKS OF MONT BLANC AND THE
MATTERHORN AND DERIVE NO PLEASURE FROM IT EXCEPT THE REFLECTION THAT IT
ISN'T A COMMON EXPERIENCE
BUT ONCE IN A WHILE ONE OF THOSE PARTIES
TRIPS AND COMES DARTING DOWN THE LONG MOUNTAIN CRAGS IN A SITTING
POSTURE MAKING THE CRUSTED SNOW SMOKE BEHIND HIM FLITTING FROM BENCH TO
BENCH AND FROM TERRACE TO TERRACE JARRING THE EARTH WHERE HE STRIKES
AND STILL GLANCING AND FLITTING ON AGAIN STICKING AN ICEBERG INTO
HIMSELF EVERY NOW AND THEN AND TEARING HIS CLOTHES SNATCHING AT THINGS
TO SAVE HIMSELF TAKING HOLD OF TREES AND FETCHING THEM ALONG WITH HIM
ROOTS AND ALL STARTING LITTLE ROCKS NOW AND THEN THEN BIG BOULDERS
THEN ACRES OF ICE AND SNOW AND PATCHES OF FOREST GATHERING AND STILL
GATHERING AS HE GOES ADDING AND STILL ADDING TO HIS MASSED AND SWEEPING
GRANDEUR AS HE NEARS A THREE THOUSAND FOOT PRECIPICE TILL AT LAST HE
WAVES HIS HAT MAGNIFICENTLY AND RIDES INTO ETERNITY ON THE BACK OF A
RAGING AND TOSSING AVALANCHE
THIS IS ALL VERY FINE BUT LET US NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY EXCITEMENT BUT
ASK CALMLY HOW DOES THIS PERSON FEEL ABOUT IT IN HIS COOLER MOMENTS NEXT
DAY WITH SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND FEET OF SNOW AND STUFF ON TOP OF HIM
WE CROSSED THE SAND HILLS NEAR THE SCENE OF THE INDIAN MAIL ROBBERY AND
MASSACRE OF 1856 WHEREIN THE DRIVER AND CONDUCTOR PERISHED AND ALSO ALL
THE PASSENGERS BUT ONE IT WAS SUPPOSED BUT THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A
MISTAKE FOR AT DIFFERENT TIMES AFTERWARD ON THE PACIFIC COAST I WAS
PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE WHO
WERE WOUNDED DURING THAT MASSACRE AND BARELY ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES
THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF THE TRUTH OF IT I HAD IT FROM THEIR OWN LIPS
ONE
OF THESE PARTIES TOLD ME THAT HE KEPT COMING ACROSS ARROW HEADS IN HIS
SYSTEM FOR NEARLY SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE MASSACRE AND ANOTHER OF THEM
TOLD ME THAT HE WAS STRUCK SO LITERALLY FULL OF ARROWS THAT AFTER THE
INDIANS WERE GONE AND HE COULD RAISE UP AND EXAMINE HIMSELF HE COULD NOT
RESTRAIN HIS TEARS FOR HIS CLOTHES WERE COMPLETELY RUINED
THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY TRADITION AVERS HOWEVER THAT ONLY ONE MAN A
PERSON NAMED BABBITT SURVIVED THE MASSACRE AND HE WAS DESPERATELY
WOUNDED
HE DRAGGED HIMSELF ON HIS HANDS AND KNEE FOR ONE LEG WAS
BROKEN TO A STATION SEVERAL MILES AWAY
HE DID IT DURING PORTIONS OF
TWO NIGHTS LYING CONCEALED ONE DAY AND PART OF ANOTHER AND FOR MORE
THAN FORTY HOURS SUFFERING UNIMAGINABLE ANGUISH FROM HUNGER THIRST AND
BODILY PAIN
THE INDIANS ROBBED THE COACH OF EVERYTHING IT CONTAINED
INCLUDING QUITE AN AMOUNT OF TREASURE
CHAPTER IX
WE PASSED FORT LARAMIE IN THE NIGHT AND ON THE SEVENTH MORNING OUT WE
FOUND OURSELVES IN THE BLACK HILLS WITH LARAMIE PEAK AT OUR ELBOW
APPARENTLY LOOMING VAST AND SOLITARY A DEEP DARK RICH INDIGO BLUE IN
HUE SO PORTENTOUSLY DID THE OLD COLOSSUS FROWN UNDER HIS BEETLING BROWS
OF STORM CLOUD
HE WAS THIRTY OR FORTY MILES AWAY IN REALITY BUT HE
ONLY SEEMED REMOVED A LITTLE BEYOND THE LOW RIDGE AT OUR RIGHT
WE
BREAKFASTED AT HORSE SHOE STATION SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILES OUT
FROM ST
JOSEPH
WE HAD NOW REACHED A HOSTILE INDIAN COUNTRY AND DURING
THE AFTERNOON WE PASSED LAPARELLE STATION AND ENJOYED GREAT DISCOMFORT
ALL THE TIME WE WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEING AWARE THAT MANY OF THE
TREES WE DASHED BY AT ARM'S LENGTH CONCEALED A LURKING INDIAN OR TWO
DURING THE PRECEDING NIGHT AN AMBUSHED SAVAGE HAD SENT A BULLET THROUGH
THE PONY RIDER'S JACKET BUT HE HAD RIDDEN ON JUST THE SAME BECAUSE
PONY RIDERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO STOP AND INQUIRE INTO SUCH THINGS EXCEPT
WHEN KILLED
AS LONG AS THEY HAD LIFE ENOUGH LEFT IN THEM THEY HAD TO
STICK TO THE HORSE AND RIDE EVEN IF THE INDIANS HAD BEEN WAITING FOR
THEM A WEEK AND WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PATIENCE
ABOUT TWO HOURS AND A
HALF BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT LAPARELLE STATION THE KEEPER IN CHARGE OF IT
HAD FIRED FOUR TIMES AT AN INDIAN BUT HE SAID WITH AN INJURED AIR THAT
THE INDIAN HAD SKIPPED AROUND SO'S TO SPILE EVERYTHING AND AMMUNITION'S
BLAMED SKURSE TOO THE MOST NATURAL INFERENCE CONVEYED BY HIS MANNER OF
SPEAKING WAS THAT IN SKIPPING AROUND THE INDIAN HAD TAKEN AN UNFAIR
ADVANTAGE
THE COACH WE WERE IN HAD A NEAT HOLE THROUGH ITS FRONT A REMINISCENCE OF
ITS LAST TRIP THROUGH THIS REGION
THE BULLET THAT MADE IT WOUNDED THE
DRIVER SLIGHTLY BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
HE SAID THE PLACE TO KEEP
A MAN HUFFY WAS DOWN ON THE SOUTHERN OVERLAND AMONG THE APACHES
BEFORE THE COMPANY MOVED THE STAGE LINE UP ON THE NORTHERN ROUTE
HE
SAID THE APACHES USED TO ANNOY HIM ALL THE TIME DOWN THERE AND THAT HE
CAME AS NEAR AS ANYTHING TO STARVING TO DEATH IN THE MIDST OF ABUNDANCE
BECAUSE THEY KEPT HIM SO LEAKY WITH BULLET HOLES THAT HE COULDN'T HOLD
HIS VITTLES
THIS PERSON'S STATEMENT WERE NOT GENERALLY BELIEVED
WE SHUT THE BLINDS DOWN VERY TIGHTLY THAT FIRST NIGHT IN THE HOSTILE
INDIAN COUNTRY AND LAY ON OUR ARMS
WE SLEPT ON THEM SOME BUT MOST OF
THE TIME WE ONLY LAY ON THEM
WE DID NOT TALK MUCH BUT KEPT QUIET AND
LISTENED
IT WAS AN INKY BLACK NIGHT AND OCCASIONALLY RAINY
WE WERE
AMONG WOODS AND ROCKS HILLS AND GORGES SO SHUT IN IN FACT THAT WHEN
WE PEEPED THROUGH A CHINK IN A CURTAIN WE COULD DISCERN NOTHING
THE
DRIVER AND CONDUCTOR ON TOP WERE STILL TOO OR ONLY SPOKE AT LONG
INTERVALS IN LOW TONES AS IS THE WAY OF MEN IN THE MIDST OF INVISIBLE
DANGERS
WE LISTENED TO RAIN DROPS PATTERING ON THE ROOF AND THE
GRINDING OF THE WHEELS THROUGH THE MUDDY GRAVEL AND THE LOW WAILING OF
THE WIND AND ALL THE TIME WE HAD THAT ABSURD SENSE UPON US INSEPARABLE
FROM TRAVEL AT NIGHT IN A CLOSE CURTAINED VEHICLE THE SENSE OF REMAINING
PERFECTLY STILL IN ONE PLACE NOTWITHSTANDING THE JOLTING AND SWAYING OF
THE VEHICLE THE TRAMPLING OF THE HORSES AND THE GRINDING OF THE WHEELS
WE LISTENED A LONG TIME WITH INTENT FACULTIES AND BATED BREATH EVERY
TIME ONE OF US WOULD RELAX AND DRAW A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF AND START TO
SAY SOMETHING A COMRADE WOULD BE SURE TO UTTER A SUDDEN HARK AND
INSTANTLY THE EXPERIMENTER WAS RIGID AND LISTENING AGAIN
SO THE
TIRESOME MINUTES AND DECADES OF MINUTES DRAGGED AWAY UNTIL AT LAST OUR
TENSE FORMS FILMED OVER WITH A DULLED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WE SLEPT IF ONE
MIGHT CALL SUCH A CONDITION BY SO STRONG A NAME FOR IT WAS A SLEEP SET
WITH A HAIR TRIGGER
IT WAS A SLEEP SEETHING AND TEEMING WITH A WEIRD
AND DISTRESSFUL CONFUSION OF SHREDS AND FAG ENDS OF DREAMS A SLEEP THAT
WAS A CHAOS
PRESENTLY DREAMS AND SLEEP AND THE SULLEN HUSH OF THE
NIGHT WERE STARTLED BY A RINGING REPORT AND CLOVEN BY SUCH A LONG WILD
AGONIZING SHRIEK THEN WE HEARD TEN STEPS FROM THE STAGE
HELP HELP HELP IT WAS OUR DRIVER'S VOICE
KILL HIM KILL HIM LIKE A DOG
I'M BEING MURDERED WILL NO MAN LEND ME A PISTOL
LOOK OUT HEAD HIM OFF HEAD HIM OFF
TWO PISTOL SHOTS A CONFUSION OF VOICES AND THE TRAMPLING OF MANY FEET
AS IF A CROWD WERE CLOSING AND SURGING TOGETHER AROUND SOME OBJECT
SEVERAL HEAVY DULL BLOWS AS WITH A CLUB A VOICE THAT SAID APPEALINGLY
DON'T GENTLEMEN PLEASE DON'T I'M A DEAD MAN THEN A FAINTER GROAN
AND ANOTHER BLOW AND AWAY SPED THE STAGE INTO THE DARKNESS AND LEFT THE
GRISLY MYSTERY BEHIND US
WHAT A STARTLE IT WAS EIGHT SECONDS WOULD AMPLY COVER THE TIME IT
OCCUPIED MAYBE EVEN FIVE WOULD DO IT
WE ONLY HAD TIME TO PLUNGE AT A
CURTAIN AND UNBUCKLE AND UNBUTTON PART OF IT IN AN AWKWARD AND HINDERING
FLURRY WHEN OUR WHIP CRACKED SHARPLY OVERHEAD AND WE WENT RUMBLING AND
THUNDERING AWAY DOWN A MOUNTAIN GRADE
WE FED ON THAT MYSTERY THE REST OF THE NIGHT WHAT WAS LEFT OF IT FOR IT
WAS WANING FAST
IT HAD TO REMAIN A PRESENT MYSTERY FOR ALL WE COULD
GET FROM THE CONDUCTOR IN ANSWER TO OUR HAILS WAS SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED
THROUGH THE CLATTER OF THE WHEELS LIKE TELL YOU IN THE MORNING
SO WE LIT OUR PIPES AND OPENED THE CORNER OF A CURTAIN FOR A CHIMNEY AND
LAY THERE IN THE DARK LISTENING TO EACH OTHER'S STORY OF HOW HE FIRST
FELT AND HOW MANY THOUSAND INDIANS HE FIRST THOUGHT HAD HURLED THEMSELVES
UPON US AND WHAT HIS REMEMBRANCE OF THE SUBSEQUENT SOUNDS WAS AND THE
ORDER OF THEIR OCCURRENCE
AND WE THEORIZED TOO BUT THERE WAS NEVER A
THEORY THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR OUR DRIVER'S VOICE BEING OUT THERE NOR YET
ACCOUNT FOR HIS INDIAN MURDERERS TALKING SUCH GOOD ENGLISH IF THEY WERE
INDIANS
SO WE CHATTED AND SMOKED THE REST OF THE NIGHT COMFORTABLY AWAY OUR
BODING ANXIETY BEING SOMEHOW MARVELOUSLY DISSIPATED BY THE REAL PRESENCE
OF SOMETHING TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT
WE NEVER DID GET MUCH SATISFACTION ABOUT THAT DARK OCCURRENCE
ALL THAT
WE COULD MAKE OUT OF THE ODDS AND ENDS OF THE INFORMATION WE GATHERED IN
THE MORNING WAS THAT THE DISTURBANCE OCCURRED AT A STATION THAT WE
CHANGED DRIVERS THERE AND THAT THE DRIVER THAT GOT OFF THERE HAD BEEN
TALKING ROUGHLY ABOUT SOME OF THE OUTLAWS THAT INFESTED THE REGION FOR
THERE WASN'T A MAN AROUND THERE BUT HAD A PRICE ON HIS HEAD AND DIDN'T
DARE SHOW HIMSELF IN THE SETTLEMENTS THE CONDUCTOR SAID HE HAD TALKED
ROUGHLY ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS AND OUGHT TO HAVE DROVE UP THERE WITH
HIS PISTOL COCKED AND READY ON THE SEAT ALONGSIDE OF HIM AND BEGUN
BUSINESS HIMSELF BECAUSE ANY SOFTY WOULD KNOW THEY WOULD BE LAYING FOR
HIM
THAT WAS ALL WE COULD GATHER AND WE COULD SEE THAT NEITHER THE CONDUCTOR
NOR THE NEW DRIVER WERE MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE MATTER
THEY PLAINLY
HAD LITTLE RESPECT FOR A MAN WHO WOULD DELIVER OFFENSIVE OPINIONS OF
PEOPLE AND THEN BE SO SIMPLE AS TO COME INTO THEIR PRESENCE UNPREPARED TO
BACK HIS JUDGMENT AS THEY PLEASANTLY PHRASED THE KILLING OF ANY
FELLOW BEING WHO DID NOT LIKE SAID OPINIONS
AND LIKEWISE THEY PLAINLY
HAD A CONTEMPT FOR THE MAN'S POOR DISCRETION IN VENTURING TO ROUSE THE
WRATH OF SUCH UTTERLY RECKLESS WILD BEASTS AS THOSE OUTLAWS AND THE
CONDUCTOR ADDED
I TELL YOU IT'S AS MUCH AS SLADE HIMSELF WANT TO DO
THIS REMARK CREATED AN ENTIRE REVOLUTION IN MY CURIOSITY
I CARED
NOTHING NOW ABOUT THE INDIANS AND EVEN LOST INTEREST IN THE MURDERED
DRIVER
THERE WAS SUCH MAGIC IN THAT NAME SLADE DAY OR NIGHT NOW I
STOOD ALWAYS READY TO DROP ANY SUBJECT IN HAND TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING
NEW ABOUT SLADE AND HIS GHASTLY EXPLOITS
EVEN BEFORE WE GOT TO OVERLAND
CITY WE HAD BEGUN TO HEAR ABOUT SLADE AND HIS DIVISION FOR HE WAS A
DIVISION AGENT ON THE OVERLAND AND FROM THE HOUR WE HAD LEFT OVERLAND
CITY WE HAD HEARD DRIVERS AND CONDUCTORS TALK ABOUT ONLY THREE THINGS
CALIFORNY THE NEVADA SILVER MINES AND THIS DESPERADO SLADE
AND A
DEAL THE MOST OF THE TALK WAS ABOUT SLADE
WE HAD GRADUALLY COME TO HAVE
A REALIZING SENSE OF THE FACT THAT SLADE WAS A MAN WHOSE HEART AND HANDS
AND SOUL WERE STEEPED IN THE BLOOD OF OFFENDERS AGAINST HIS DIGNITY A
MAN WHO AWFULLY AVENGED ALL INJURIES AFFRONT INSULTS OR SLIGHTS OF
WHATEVER KIND ON THE SPOT IF HE COULD YEARS AFTERWARD IF LACK OF
EARLIER OPPORTUNITY COMPELLED IT A MAN WHOSE HATE TORTURED HIM DAY AND
NIGHT TILL VENGEANCE APPEASED IT AND NOT AN ORDINARY VENGEANCE EITHER
BUT HIS ENEMY'S ABSOLUTE DEATH NOTHING LESS A MAN WHOSE FACE WOULD
LIGHT UP WITH A TERRIBLE JOY WHEN HE SURPRISED A FOE AND HAD HIM AT A
DISADVANTAGE
A HIGH AND EFFICIENT SERVANT OF THE OVERLAND AN OUTLAW
AMONG OUTLAWS AND YET THEIR RELENTLESS SCOURGE SLADE WAS AT ONCE THE
MOST BLOODY THE MOST DANGEROUS AND THE MOST VALUABLE CITIZEN THAT
INHABITED THE SAVAGE FASTNESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS
CHAPTER X
REALLY AND TRULY TWO THIRDS OF THE TALK OF DRIVERS AND CONDUCTORS HAD
BEEN ABOUT THIS MAN SLADE EVER SINCE THE DAY BEFORE WE REACHED
JULESBURG
IN ORDER THAT THE EASTERN READER MAY HAVE A CLEAR CONCEPTION
OF WHAT A ROCKY MOUNTAIN DESPERADO IS IN HIS HIGHEST STATE OF
DEVELOPMENT I WILL REDUCE ALL THIS MASS OF OVERLAND GOSSIP TO ONE
STRAIGHTFORWARD NARRATIVE AND PRESENT IT IN THE FOLLOWING SHAPE
SLADE WAS BORN IN ILLINOIS OF GOOD PARENTAGE
AT ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS
OF AGE HE KILLED A MAN IN A QUARREL AND FLED THE COUNTRY
AT ST
JOSEPH
MISSOURI HE JOINED ONE OF THE EARLY CALIFORNIA BOUND EMIGRANT TRAINS
AND WAS GIVEN THE POST OF TRAIN MASTER
ONE DAY ON THE PLAINS HE HAD AN
ANGRY DISPUTE WITH ONE OF HIS WAGON DRIVERS AND BOTH DREW THEIR
REVOLVERS
BUT THE DRIVER WAS THE QUICKER ARTIST AND HAD HIS WEAPON
COCKED FIRST
SO SLADE SAID IT WAS A PITY TO WASTE LIFE ON SO SMALL A
MATTER AND PROPOSED THAT THE PISTOLS BE THROWN ON THE GROUND AND THE
QUARREL SETTLED BY A FIST FIGHT
THE UNSUSPECTING DRIVER AGREED AND
THREW DOWN HIS PISTOL WHEREUPON SLADE LAUGHED AT HIS SIMPLICITY AND
SHOT HIM DEAD
HE MADE HIS ESCAPE AND LIVED A WILD LIFE FOR AWHILE DIVIDING HIS TIME
BETWEEN FIGHTING INDIANS AND AVOIDING AN ILLINOIS SHERIFF WHO HAD BEEN
SENT TO ARREST HIM FOR HIS FIRST MURDER
IT IS SAID THAT IN ONE INDIAN
BATTLE HE KILLED THREE SAVAGES WITH HIS OWN HAND AND AFTERWARD CUT THEIR
EARS OFF AND SENT THEM WITH HIS COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHIEF OF THE TRIBE
SLADE SOON GAINED A NAME FOR FEARLESS RESOLUTION AND THIS WAS SUFFICIENT
MERIT TO PROCURE FOR HIM THE IMPORTANT POST OF OVERLAND DIVISION AGENT AT
JULESBURG IN PLACE OF MR
JULES REMOVED
FOR SOME TIME PREVIOUSLY THE
COMPANY'S HORSES HAD BEEN FREQUENTLY STOLEN AND THE COACHES DELAYED BY
GANGS OF OUTLAWS WHO WERE WONT TO LAUGH AT THE IDEA OF ANY MAN'S HAVING
THE TEMERITY TO RESENT SUCH OUTRAGES
SLADE RESENTED THEM PROMPTLY
THE OUTLAWS SOON FOUND THAT THE NEW AGENT WAS A MAN WHO DID NOT FEAR
ANYTHING THAT BREATHED THE BREATH OF LIFE
HE MADE SHORT WORK OF ALL
OFFENDERS
THE RESULT WAS THAT DELAYS CEASED THE COMPANY'S PROPERTY WAS
LET ALONE AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED OR WHO SUFFERED SLADE'S COACHES
WENT THROUGH EVERY TIME TRUE IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT THIS WHOLESOME
CHANGE SLADE HAD TO KILL SEVERAL MEN SOME SAY THREE OTHERS SAY FOUR
AND OTHERS SIX BUT THE WORLD WAS THE RICHER FOR THEIR LOSS
THE FIRST
PROMINENT DIFFICULTY HE HAD WAS WITH THE EX AGENT JULES WHO BORE THE
REPUTATION OF BEING A RECKLESS AND DESPERATE MAN HIMSELF
JULES HATED
SLADE FOR SUPPLANTING HIM AND A GOOD FAIR OCCASION FOR A FIGHT WAS ALL
HE WAS WAITING FOR
BY AND BY SLADE DARED TO EMPLOY A MAN WHOM JULES HAD
ONCE DISCHARGED
NEXT SLADE SEIZED A TEAM OF STAGE HORSES WHICH HE
ACCUSED JULES OF HAVING DRIVEN OFF AND HIDDEN SOMEWHERE FOR HIS OWN USE
WAR WAS DECLARED AND FOR A DAY OR TWO THE TWO MEN WALKED WARILY ABOUT
THE STREETS SEEKING EACH OTHER JULES ARMED WITH A DOUBLE BARRELED SHOT
GUN AND SLADE WITH HIS HISTORY CREATING REVOLVER
FINALLY AS SLADE
STEPPED INTO A STORE JULES POURED THE CONTENTS OF HIS GUN INTO HIM FROM
BEHIND THE DOOR
SLADE WAS PLUCKY AND JULES GOT SEVERAL BAD PISTOL
WOUNDS IN RETURN
THEN BOTH MEN FELL AND WERE CARRIED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE LODGINGS BOTH
SWEARING THAT BETTER AIM SHOULD DO DEADLIER WORK NEXT TIME
BOTH WERE
BEDRIDDEN A LONG TIME BUT JULES GOT TO HIS FEET FIRST AND GATHERING HIS
POSSESSIONS TOGETHER PACKED THEM ON A COUPLE OF MULES AND FLED TO THE
ROCKY MOUNTAINS TO GATHER STRENGTH IN SAFETY AGAINST THE DAY OF
RECKONING
FOR MANY MONTHS HE WAS NOT SEEN OR HEARD OF AND WAS
GRADUALLY DROPPED OUT OF THE REMEMBRANCE OF ALL SAVE SLADE HIMSELF
BUT
SLADE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FORGET HIM
ON THE CONTRARY COMMON REPORT SAID
THAT SLADE KEPT A REWARD STANDING FOR HIS CAPTURE DEAD OR ALIVE
AFTER AWHILE SEEING THAT SLADE'S ENERGETIC ADMINISTRATION HAD RESTORED
PEACE AND ORDER TO ONE OF THE WORST DIVISIONS OF THE ROAD THE OVERLAND
STAGE COMPANY TRANSFERRED HIM TO THE ROCKY RIDGE DIVISION IN THE ROCKY
MOUNTAINS TO SEE IF HE COULD PERFORM A LIKE MIRACLE THERE
IT WAS THE
VERY PARADISE OF OUTLAWS AND DESPERADOES
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO
SEMBLANCE OF LAW THERE
VIOLENCE WAS THE RULE
FORCE WAS THE ONLY
RECOGNIZED AUTHORITY
THE COMMONEST MISUNDERSTANDINGS WERE SETTLED ON
THE SPOT WITH THE REVOLVER OR THE KNIFE
MURDERS WERE DONE IN OPEN DAY
AND WITH SPARKLING FREQUENCY AND NOBODY THOUGHT OF INQUIRING INTO THEM
IT WAS CONSIDERED THAT THE PARTIES WHO DID THE KILLING HAD THEIR PRIVATE
REASONS FOR IT FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO MEDDLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKED UPON AS
INDELICATE
AFTER A MURDER ALL THAT ROCKY MOUNTAIN ETIQUETTE REQUIRED
OF A SPECTATOR WAS THAT HE SHOULD HELP THE GENTLEMAN BURY HIS GAME
OTHERWISE HIS CHURLISHNESS WOULD SURELY BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM THE
FIRST TIME HE KILLED A MAN HIMSELF AND NEEDED A NEIGHBORLY TURN IN
INTERRING HIM
SLADE TOOK UP HIS RESIDENCE SWEETLY AND PEACEFULLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS
HIVE OF HORSE THIEVES AND ASSASSINS AND THE VERY FIRST TIME ONE OF THEM
AIRED HIS INSOLENT SWAGGERINGS IN HIS PRESENCE HE SHOT HIM DEAD HE
BEGAN A RAID ON THE OUTLAWS AND IN A SINGULARLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME HE
HAD COMPLETELY STOPPED THEIR DEPREDATIONS ON THE STAGE STOCK RECOVERED A
LARGE NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES KILLED SEVERAL OF THE WORST DESPERADOES OF
THE DISTRICT AND GAINED SUCH A DREAD ASCENDANCY OVER THE REST THAT THEY
RESPECTED HIM ADMIRED HIM FEARED HIM OBEYED HIM HE WROUGHT THE SAME
MARVELOUS CHANGE IN THE WAYS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT HAD MARKED HIS
ADMINISTRATION AT OVERLAND CITY
HE CAPTURED TWO MEN WHO HAD STOLEN
OVERLAND STOCK AND WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE HANGED THEM
HE WAS SUPREME
JUDGE IN HIS DISTRICT AND HE WAS JURY AND EXECUTIONER LIKEWISE AND NOT
ONLY IN THE CASE OF OFFENCES AGAINST HIS EMPLOYERS BUT AGAINST PASSING
EMIGRANTS AS WELL
ON ONE OCCASION SOME EMIGRANTS HAD THEIR STOCK LOST
OR STOLEN AND TOLD SLADE WHO CHANCED TO VISIT THEIR CAMP
WITH A
SINGLE COMPANION HE RODE TO A RANCH THE OWNERS OF WHICH HE SUSPECTED
AND OPENING THE DOOR COMMENCED FIRING KILLING THREE AND WOUNDING THE
FOURTH
FROM A BLOODTHIRSTILY INTERESTING LITTLE MONTANA BOOK THE VIGILANTES
OF MONTANA BY PROF
THOS
J
DIMSDALE I TAKE THIS PARAGRAPH
WHILE ON THE ROAD SLADE HELD ABSOLUTE SWAY
HE WOULD RIDE DOWN TO
A STATION GET INTO A QUARREL TURN THE HOUSE OUT OF WINDOWS AND
MALTREAT THE OCCUPANTS MOST CRUELLY
THE UNFORTUNATES HAD NO MEANS
OF REDRESS AND WERE COMPELLED TO RECUPERATE AS BEST THEY COULD
ON ONE OF THESE OCCASIONS IT IS SAID HE KILLED THE FATHER OF THE FINE
LITTLE HALF BREED BOY JEMMY WHOM HE ADOPTED AND WHO LIVED WITH HIS
WIDOW AFTER HIS EXECUTION
STORIES OF SLADE'S HANGING MEN AND OF
INNUMERABLE ASSAULTS SHOOTINGS STABBINGS AND BEATINGS IN WHICH HE WAS
A PRINCIPAL ACTOR FORM PART OF THE LEGENDS OF THE STAGE LINE
AS FOR
MINOR QUARRELS AND SHOOTINGS IT IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT A MINUTE
HISTORY OF SLADE'S LIFE WOULD BE ONE LONG RECORD OF SUCH PRACTICES
SLADE WAS A MATCHLESS MARKSMAN WITH A NAVY REVOLVER
THE LEGENDS SAY
THAT ONE MORNING AT ROCKY RIDGE WHEN HE WAS FEELING COMFORTABLE HE SAW
A MAN APPROACHING WHO HAD OFFENDED HIM SOME DAYS BEFORE OBSERVE THE FINE
MEMORY HE HAD FOR MATTERS LIKE THAT AND GENTLEMEN SAID SLADE
DRAWING IT IS A GOOD TWENTY YARD SHOT I'LL CLIP THE THIRD BUTTON ON
HIS COAT WHICH HE DID
THE BYSTANDERS ALL ADMIRED IT
AND THEY ALL
ATTENDED THE FUNERAL TOO
ON ONE OCCASION A MAN WHO KEPT A LITTLE WHISKY SHELF AT THE STATION DID
SOMETHING WHICH ANGERED SLADE AND WENT AND MADE HIS WILL
A DAY OR TWO
AFTERWARD SLADE CAME IN AND CALLED FOR SOME BRANDY
THE MAN REACHED
UNDER THE COUNTER OSTENSIBLY TO GET A BOTTLE POSSIBLY TO GET SOMETHING
ELSE BUT SLADE SMILED UPON HIM THAT PECULIARLY BLAND AND SATISFIED
SMILE OF HIS WHICH THE NEIGHBORS HAD LONG AGO LEARNED TO RECOGNIZE AS A
DEATH WARRANT IN DISGUISE AND TOLD HIM TO NONE OF THAT PASS OUT THE
HIGH PRICED ARTICLE SO THE POOR BAR KEEPER HAD TO TURN HIS BACK AND
GET THE HIGH PRICED BRANDY FROM THE SHELF AND WHEN HE FACED AROUND AGAIN
HE WAS LOOKING INTO THE MUZZLE OF SLADE'S PISTOL
AND THE NEXT
INSTANT ADDED MY INFORMANT IMPRESSIVELY HE WAS ONE OF THE DEADEST
MEN THAT EVER LIVED
THE STAGE DRIVERS AND CONDUCTORS TOLD US THAT SOMETIMES SLADE WOULD LEAVE
A HATED ENEMY WHOLLY UNMOLESTED UNNOTICED AND UNMENTIONED FOR WEEKS
TOGETHER HAD DONE IT ONCE OR TWICE AT ANY RATE
AND SOME SAID THEY
BELIEVED HE DID IT IN ORDER TO LULL THE VICTIMS INTO UNWATCHFULNESS SO
THAT HE COULD GET THE ADVANTAGE OF THEM AND OTHERS SAID THEY BELIEVED HE
SAVED UP AN ENEMY THAT WAY JUST AS A SCHOOLBOY SAVES UP A CAKE AND MADE
THE PLEASURE GO AS FAR AS IT WOULD BY GLOATING OVER THE ANTICIPATION
ONE OF THESE CASES WAS THAT OF A FRENCHMAN WHO HAD OFFENDED SLADE
TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERYBODY SLADE DID NOT KILL HIM ON THE SPOT BUT LET
HIM ALONE FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME
FINALLY HOWEVER HE WENT TO THE
FRENCHMAN'S HOUSE VERY LATE ONE NIGHT KNOCKED AND WHEN HIS ENEMY OPENED
THE DOOR SHOT HIM DEAD PUSHED THE CORPSE INSIDE THE DOOR WITH HIS FOOT
SET THE HOUSE ON FIRE AND BURNED UP THE DEAD MAN HIS WIDOW AND THREE
CHILDREN I HEARD THIS STORY FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND THEY
EVIDENTLY BELIEVED WHAT THEY WERE SAYING
IT MAY BE TRUE AND IT MAY
NOT
GIVE A DOG A BAD NAME ETC
SLADE WAS CAPTURED ONCE BY A PARTY OF MEN WHO INTENDED TO LYNCH HIM
THEY DISARMED HIM AND SHUT HIM UP IN A STRONG LOG HOUSE AND PLACED A
GUARD OVER HIM
HE PREVAILED ON HIS CAPTORS TO SEND FOR HIS WIFE SO
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A LAST INTERVIEW WITH HER
SHE WAS A BRAVE LOVING
SPIRITED WOMAN
SHE JUMPED ON A HORSE AND RODE FOR LIFE AND DEATH
WHEN SHE ARRIVED THEY LET HER IN WITHOUT SEARCHING HER AND BEFORE THE
DOOR COULD BE CLOSED SHE WHIPPED OUT A COUPLE OF REVOLVERS AND SHE AND
HER LORD MARCHED FORTH DEFYING THE PARTY
AND THEN UNDER A BRISK FIRE
THEY MOUNTED DOUBLE AND GALLOPED AWAY UNHARMED
IN THE FULNESS OF TIME SLADE'S MYRMIDONS CAPTURED HIS ANCIENT ENEMY
JULES WHOM THEY FOUND IN A WELL CHOSEN HIDING PLACE IN THE REMOTE
FASTNESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS GAINING A PRECARIOUS LIVELIHOOD WITH HIS
RIFLE
THEY BROUGHT HIM TO ROCKY RIDGE BOUND HAND AND FOOT AND
DEPOSITED HIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CATTLE YARD WITH HIS BACK AGAINST A
POST
IT IS SAID THAT THE PLEASURE THAT LIT SLADE'S FACE WHEN HE HEARD
OF IT WAS SOMETHING FEARFUL TO CONTEMPLATE
HE EXAMINED HIS ENEMY TO SEE
THAT HE WAS SECURELY TIED AND THEN WENT TO BED CONTENT TO WAIT TILL
MORNING BEFORE ENJOYING THE LUXURY OF KILLING HIM
JULES SPENT THE NIGHT
IN THE CATTLE YARD AND IT IS A REGION WHERE WARM NIGHTS ARE NEVER KNOWN
IN THE MORNING SLADE PRACTISED ON HIM WITH HIS REVOLVER NIPPING THE
FLESH HERE AND THERE AND OCCASIONALLY CLIPPING OFF A FINGER WHILE JULES
BEGGED HIM TO KILL HIM OUTRIGHT AND PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY
FINALLY
SLADE RELOADED AND WALKING UP CLOSE TO HIS VICTIM MADE SOME
CHARACTERISTIC REMARKS AND THEN DISPATCHED HIM
THE BODY LAY THERE HALF
A DAY NOBODY VENTURING TO TOUCH IT WITHOUT ORDERS AND THEN SLADE
DETAILED A PARTY AND ASSISTED AT THE BURIAL HIMSELF
BUT HE FIRST CUT
OFF THE DEAD MAN'S EARS AND PUT THEM IN HIS VEST POCKET WHERE HE CARRIED
THEM FOR SOME TIME WITH GREAT SATISFACTION
THAT IS THE STORY AS I HAVE
FREQUENTLY HEARD IT TOLD AND SEEN IT IN PRINT IN CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPERS
IT IS DOUBTLESS CORRECT IN ALL ESSENTIAL PARTICULARS
IN DUE TIME WE RATTLED UP TO A STAGE STATION AND SAT DOWN TO
BREAKFAST WITH A HALF SAVAGE HALF CIVILIZED COMPANY OF ARMED AND
BEARDED MOUNTAINEERS RANCHMEN AND STATION EMPLOYEES
THE MOST
GENTLEMANLY APPEARING QUIET AND AFFABLE OFFICER WE HAD YET FOUND ALONG
THE ROAD IN THE OVERLAND COMPANY'S SERVICE WAS THE PERSON WHO SAT AT THE
HEAD OF THE TABLE AT MY ELBOW
NEVER YOUTH STARED AND SHIVERED AS I DID
WHEN I HEARD THEM CALL HIM SLADE
HERE WAS ROMANCE AND I SITTING FACE TO FACE WITH IT LOOKING UPON IT
TOUCHING IT HOBNOBBING WITH IT AS IT WERE HERE RIGHT BY MY SIDE WAS
THE ACTUAL OGRE WHO IN FIGHTS AND BRAWLS AND VARIOUS WAYS HAD TAKEN THE
LIVES OF TWENTY SIX HUMAN BEINGS OR ALL MEN LIED ABOUT HIM I SUPPOSE I
WAS THE PROUDEST STRIPLING THAT EVER TRAVELED TO SEE STRANGE LANDS AND
WONDERFUL PEOPLE
HE WAS SO FRIENDLY AND SO GENTLE SPOKEN THAT I WARMED TO HIM IN
SPITE OF HIS AWFUL HISTORY
IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO REALIZE THAT
THIS PLEASANT PERSON WAS THE PITILESS SCOURGE OF THE OUTLAWS THE
RAW HEAD AND BLOODY BONES THE NURSING MOTHERS OF THE MOUNTAINS TERRIFIED
THEIR CHILDREN WITH
AND TO THIS DAY I CAN REMEMBER NOTHING REMARKABLE
ABOUT SLADE EXCEPT THAT HIS FACE WAS RATHER BROAD ACROSS THE CHEEK BONES
AND THAT THE CHEEK BONES WERE LOW AND THE LIPS PECULIARLY THIN AND
STRAIGHT
BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH TO LEAVE SOMETHING OF AN EFFECT UPON ME
FOR SINCE THEN I SELDOM SEE A FACE POSSESSING THOSE CHARACTERISTICS
WITHOUT FANCYING THAT THE OWNER OF IT IS A DANGEROUS MAN
THE COFFEE RAN OUT
AT LEAST IT WAS REDUCED TO ONE TIN CUPFUL AND SLADE
WAS ABOUT TO TAKE IT WHEN HE SAW THAT MY CUP WAS EMPTY
HE POLITELY OFFERED TO FILL IT BUT ALTHOUGH I WANTED IT I POLITELY
DECLINED
I WAS AFRAID HE HAD NOT KILLED ANYBODY THAT MORNING AND MIGHT
BE NEEDING DIVERSION
BUT STILL WITH FIRM POLITENESS HE INSISTED ON
FILLING MY CUP AND SAID I HAD TRAVELED ALL NIGHT AND BETTER DESERVED IT
THAN HE AND WHILE HE TALKED HE PLACIDLY POURED THE FLUID TO THE LAST
DROP
I THANKED HIM AND DRANK IT BUT IT GAVE ME NO COMFORT FOR I COULD
NOT FEEL SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SORRY PRESENTLY THAT HE HAD GIVEN IT
AWAY AND PROCEED TO KILL ME TO DISTRACT HIS THOUGHTS FROM THE LOSS
BUT NOTHING OF THE KIND OCCURRED
WE LEFT HIM WITH ONLY TWENTY SIX DEAD
PEOPLE TO ACCOUNT FOR AND I FELT A TRANQUIL SATISFACTION IN THE THOUGHT
THAT IN SO JUDICIOUSLY TAKING CARE OF NO
1 AT THAT BREAKFAST TABLE I HAD
PLEASANTLY ESCAPED BEING NO
27
SLADE CAME OUT TO THE COACH AND SAW US
OFF FIRST ORDERING CERTAIN REARRANGEMENTS OF THE MAIL BAGS FOR OUR
COMFORT AND THEN WE TOOK LEAVE OF HIM SATISFIED THAT WE SHOULD HEAR OF
HIM AGAIN SOME DAY AND WONDERING IN WHAT CONNECTION
CHAPTER XI
AND SURE ENOUGH TWO OR THREE YEARS AFTERWARD WE DID HEAR HIM AGAIN
NEWS CAME TO THE PACIFIC COAST THAT THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE IN MONTANA
WHITHER SLADE HAD REMOVED FROM ROCKY RIDGE HAD HANGED HIM
I FIND AN
ACCOUNT OF THE AFFAIR IN THE THRILLING LITTLE BOOK I QUOTED A PARAGRAPH
FROM IN THE LAST CHAPTER THE VIGILANTES OF MONTANA BEING A RELIABLE
ACCOUNT OF THE CAPTURE TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF HENRY PLUMMER'S NOTORIOUS
ROAD AGENT BAND BY PROF
THOS
J
DIMSDALE VIRGINIA CITY M T
MR
DIMSDALE'S CHAPTER IS WELL WORTH READING AS A SPECIMEN OF HOW THE
PEOPLE OF THE FRONTIER DEAL WITH CRIMINALS WHEN THE COURTS OF LAW PROVE
INEFFICIENT
MR
DIMSDALE MAKES TWO REMARKS ABOUT SLADE BOTH OF WHICH
ARE ACCURATELY DESCRIPTIVE AND ONE OF WHICH IS EXCEEDINGLY PICTURESQUE
THOSE WHO SAW HIM IN HIS NATURAL STATE ONLY WOULD PRONOUNCE HIM TO BE A
KIND HUSBAND A MOST HOSPITABLE HOST AND A COURTEOUS GENTLEMAN ON THE
CONTRARY THOSE WHO MET HIM WHEN MADDENED WITH LIQUOR AND SURROUNDED BY A
GANG OF ARMED ROUGHS WOULD PRONOUNCE HIM A FIEND INCARNATE AND THIS
FROM FORT KEARNEY WEST HE WAS FEARED A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN THE
ALMIGHTY FOR COMPACTNESS SIMPLICITY AND VIGOR OF EXPRESSION I WILL
BACK THAT SENTENCE AGAINST ANYTHING IN LITERATURE
MR
DIMSDALE'S
NARRATIVE IS AS FOLLOWS
IN ALL PLACES WHERE ITALICS OCCUR THEY ARE
MINE
AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THE FIVE MEN ON THE 14TH OF JANUARY THE
VIGILANTES CONSIDERED THAT THEIR WORK WAS NEARLY ENDED
THEY HAD
FREED THE COUNTRY OF HIGHWAYMEN AND MURDERERS TO A GREAT EXTENT AND
THEY DETERMINED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THE REGULAR CIVIL AUTHORITY
THEY WOULD ESTABLISH A PEOPLE'S COURT WHERE ALL OFFENDERS SHOULD BE
TRIED BY JUDGE AND JURY
THIS WAS THE NEAREST APPROACH TO SOCIAL
ORDER THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED AND THOUGH STRICT LEGAL
AUTHORITY WAS WANTING YET THE PEOPLE WERE FIRMLY DETERMINED TO
MAINTAIN ITS EFFICIENCY AND TO ENFORCE ITS DECREES
IT MAY HERE BE
MENTIONED THAT THE OVERT ACT WHICH WAS THE LAST ROUND ON THE FATAL
LADDER LEADING TO THE SCAFFOLD ON WHICH SLADE PERISHED WAS THE
TEARING IN PIECES AND STAMPING UPON A WRIT OF THIS COURT FOLLOWED
BY HIS ARREST OF THE JUDGE ALEX
DAVIS BY AUTHORITY OF A PRESENTED
DERRINGER AND WITH HIS OWN HANDS
J
A
SLADE WAS HIMSELF WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED A VIGILANTE HE
OPENLY BOASTED OF IT AND SAID HE KNEW ALL THAT THEY KNEW
HE WAS
NEVER ACCUSED OR EVEN SUSPECTED OF EITHER MURDER OR ROBBERY
COMMITTED IN THIS TERRITORY THE LATTER CRIME WAS NEVER LAID TO HIS
CHARGE IN ANY PLACE BUT THAT HE HAD KILLED SEVERAL MEN IN OTHER
LOCALITIES WAS NOTORIOUS AND HIS BAD REPUTATION IN THIS RESPECT WAS
A MOST POWERFUL ARGUMENT IN DETERMINING HIS FATE WHEN HE WAS
FINALLY ARRESTED FOR THE OFFENCE ABOVE MENTIONED
ON RETURNING FROM
MILK RIVER HE BECAME MORE AND MORE ADDICTED TO DRINKING UNTIL AT
LAST IT WAS A COMMON FEAT FOR HIM AND HIS FRIENDS TO TAKE THE
TOWN HE AND A COUPLE OF HIS DEPENDENTS MIGHT OFTEN BE SEEN ON ONE
HORSE GALLOPING THROUGH THE STREETS SHOUTING AND YELLING FIRING
REVOLVERS ETC
ON MANY OCCASIONS HE WOULD RIDE HIS HORSE INTO
STORES BREAK UP BARS TOSS THE SCALES OUT OF DOORS AND USE MOST
INSULTING LANGUAGE TO PARTIES PRESENT
JUST PREVIOUS TO THE DAY OF
HIS ARREST HE HAD GIVEN A FEARFUL BEATING TO ONE OF HIS FOLLOWERS
BUT SUCH WAS HIS INFLUENCE OVER THEM THAT THE MAN WEPT BITTERLY AT
THE GALLOWS AND BEGGED FOR HIS LIFE WITH ALL HIS POWER
IT HAD
BECOME QUITE COMMON WHEN SLADE WAS ON A SPREE FOR THE SHOP KEEPERS
AND CITIZENS TO CLOSE THE STORES AND PUT OUT ALL THE LIGHTS BEING
FEARFUL OF SOME OUTRAGE AT HIS HANDS
FOR HIS WANTON DESTRUCTION OF
GOODS AND FURNITURE HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO PAY WHEN SOBER IF HE
HAD MONEY BUT THERE WERE NOT A FEW WHO REGARDED PAYMENT AS SMALL
SATISFACTION FOR THE OUTRAGE AND THESE MEN WERE HIS PERSONAL
ENEMIES
FROM TIME TO TIME SLADE RECEIVED WARNINGS FROM MEN THAT HE WELL KNEW
WOULD NOT DECEIVE HIM OF THE CERTAIN END OF HIS CONDUCT
THERE WAS
NOT A MOMENT FOR WEEKS PREVIOUS TO HIS ARREST IN WHICH THE PUBLIC
DID NOT EXPECT TO HEAR OF SOME BLOODY OUTRAGE
THE DREAD OF HIS
VERY NAME AND THE PRESENCE OF THE ARMED BAND OF HANGERS ON WHO
FOLLOWED HIM ALONE PREVENTED A RESISTANCE WHICH MUST CERTAINLY HAVE
ENDED IN THE INSTANT MURDER OR MUTILATION OF THE OPPOSING PARTY
SLADE WAS FREQUENTLY ARRESTED BY ORDER OF THE COURT WHOSE
ORGANIZATION WE HAVE DESCRIBED AND HAD TREATED IT WITH RESPECT BY
PAYING ONE OR TWO FINES AND PROMISING TO PAY THE REST WHEN HE HAD
MONEY BUT IN THE TRANSACTION THAT OCCURRED AT THIS CRISIS HE
FORGOT EVEN THIS CAUTION AND GOADED BY PASSION AND THE HATRED OF
RESTRAINT HE SPRANG INTO THE EMBRACE OF DEATH
SLADE HAD BEEN DRUNK AND CUTTING UP ALL NIGHT
HE AND HIS
COMPANIONS HAD MADE THE TOWN A PERFECT HELL
IN THE MORNING J
M
FOX THE SHERIFF MET HIM ARRESTED HIM TOOK HIM INTO COURT AND
COMMENCED READING A WARRANT THAT HE HAD FOR HIS ARREST BY WAY OF
ARRAIGNMENT
HE BECAME UNCONTROLLABLY FURIOUS AND SEIZING THE
WRIT HE TORE IT UP THREW IT ON THE GROUND AND STAMPED UPON IT
THE CLICKING OF THE LOCKS OF HIS COMPANIONS' REVOLVERS WAS INSTANTLY
HEARD AND A CRISIS WAS EXPECTED
THE SHERIFF DID NOT ATTEMPT HIS
RETENTION BUT BEING AT LEAST AS PRUDENT AS HE WAS VALIANT HE
SUCCUMBED LEAVING SLADE THE MASTER OF THE SITUATION AND THE
CONQUEROR AND RULER OF THE COURTS LAW AND LAW MAKERS
THIS WAS A
DECLARATION OF WAR AND WAS SO ACCEPTED
THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
NOW FELT THAT THE QUESTION OF SOCIAL ORDER AND THE PREPONDERANCE OF
THE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS HAD THEN AND THERE TO BE DECIDED
THEY
KNEW THE CHARACTER OF SLADE AND THEY WERE WELL AWARE THAT THEY MUST
SUBMIT TO HIS RULE WITHOUT MURMUR OR ELSE THAT HE MUST BE DEALT
WITH IN SUCH FASHION AS WOULD PREVENT HIS BEING ABLE TO WREAK HIS
VENGEANCE ON THE COMMITTEE WHO COULD NEVER HAVE HOPED TO LIVE IN
THE TERRITORY SECURE FROM OUTRAGE OR DEATH AND WHO COULD NEVER
LEAVE IT WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING HIS FRIEND WHOM HIS VICTORY WOULD
HAVE EMBOLDENED AND STIMULATED TO A PITCH THAT WOULD HAVE RENDERED
THEM RECKLESS OF CONSEQUENCES
THE DAY PREVIOUS HE HAD RIDDEN INTO
DORRIS'S STORE AND ON BEING REQUESTED TO LEAVE HE DREW HIS
REVOLVER AND THREATENED TO KILL THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE TO HIM
ANOTHER SALOON HE HAD LED HIS HORSE INTO AND BUYING A BOTTLE OF
WINE HE TRIED TO MAKE THE ANIMAL DRINK IT
THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED
AN UNCOMMON PERFORMANCE AS HE HAD OFTEN ENTERED SALOONS AND
COMMENCED FIRING AT THE LAMPS CAUSING A WILD STAMPEDE
A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MET SLADE AND INFORMED HIM IN THE
QUIET EARNEST MANNER OF ONE WHO FEELS THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT HE IS
SAYING SLADE GET YOUR HORSE AT ONCE AND GO HOME OR THERE WILL
BE TO PAY SLADE STARTED AND TOOK A LONG LOOK WITH HIS DARK
AND PIERCING EYES AT THE GENTLEMAN
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SAID HE
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK ME WHAT I MEAN WAS THE QUIET REPLY GET
YOUR HORSE AT ONCE AND REMEMBER WHAT I TELL YOU AFTER A SHORT
PAUSE HE PROMISED TO DO SO AND ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE SADDLE BUT
BEING STILL INTOXICATED HE BEGAN CALLING ALOUD TO ONE AFTER ANOTHER
OF HIS FRIENDS AND AT LAST SEEMED TO HAVE FORGOTTEN THE WARNING HE
HAD RECEIVED AND BECAME AGAIN UPROARIOUS SHOUTING THE NAME OF A
WELL KNOWN COURTEZAN IN COMPANY WITH THOSE OF TWO MEN WHOM HE
CONSIDERED HEADS OF THE COMMITTEE AS A SORT OF CHALLENGE PERHAPS
HOWEVER AS A SIMPLE ACT OF BRAVADO
IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT THE
INTIMATION OF PERSONAL DANGER HE HAD RECEIVED HAD NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN
ENTIRELY THOUGH FATALLY FOR HIM HE TOOK A FOOLISH WAY OF SHOWING
HIS REMEMBRANCE OF IT
HE SOUGHT OUT ALEXANDER DAVIS THE JUDGE OF
THE COURT AND DRAWING A COCKED DERRINGER HE PRESENTED IT AT HIS
HEAD AND TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD HOLD HIM AS A HOSTAGE FOR HIS OWN
SAFETY
AS THE JUDGE STOOD PERFECTLY QUIET AND OFFERED NO
RESISTANCE TO HIS CAPTOR NO FURTHER OUTRAGE FOLLOWED ON THIS SCORE
PREVIOUS TO THIS ON ACCOUNT OF THE CRITICAL STATE OF AFFAIRS THE
COMMITTEE HAD MET AND AT LAST RESOLVED TO ARREST HIM
HIS
EXECUTION HAD NOT BEEN AGREED UPON AND AT THAT TIME WOULD HAVE
BEEN NEGATIVED MOST ASSUREDLY
A MESSENGER RODE DOWN TO NEVADA TO
INFORM THE LEADING MEN OF WHAT WAS ON HAND AS IT WAS DESIRABLE TO
SHOW THAT THERE WAS A FEELING OF UNANIMITY ON THE SUBJECT ALL ALONG
THE GULCH
THE MINERS TURNED OUT ALMOST EN MASSE LEAVING THEIR WORK AND
FORMING IN SOLID COLUMN ABOUT SIX HUNDRED STRONG ARMED TO THE
TEETH THEY MARCHED UP TO VIRGINIA
THE LEADER OF THE BODY WELL
KNEW THE TEMPER OF HIS MEN ON THE SUBJECT
HE SPURRED ON AHEAD OF
THEM AND HASTILY CALLING A MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE HE TOLD THEM
PLAINLY THAT THE MINERS MEANT BUSINESS AND THAT IF THEY CAME UP
THEY WOULD NOT STAND IN THE STREET TO BE SHOT DOWN BY SLADE'S
FRIENDS BUT THAT THEY WOULD TAKE HIM AND HANG HIM
THE MEETING WAS
SMALL AS THE VIRGINIA MEN WERE LOATH TO ACT AT ALL
THIS MOMENTOUS
ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FEELING OF THE LOWER TOWN WAS MADE TO A CLUSTER
OF MEN WHO WERE DELIBERATION BEHIND A WAGON AT THE REAR OF A STORE
ON MAIN STREET
THE COMMITTEE WERE MOST UNWILLING TO PROCEED TO EXTREMITIES
ALL
THE DUTY THEY HAD EVER PERFORMED SEEMED AS NOTHING TO THE TASK
BEFORE THEM BUT THEY HAD TO DECIDE AND THAT QUICKLY
IT WAS
FINALLY AGREED THAT IF THE WHOLE BODY OF THE MINERS WERE OF THE
OPINION THAT HE SHOULD BE HANGED THAT THE COMMITTEE LEFT IT IN
THEIR HANDS TO DEAL WITH HIM
OFF AT HOT SPEED RODE THE LEADER OF
THE NEVADA MEN TO JOIN HIS COMMAND
SLADE HAD FOUND OUT WHAT WAS INTENDED AND THE NEWS SOBERED HIM
INSTANTLY
HE WENT INTO P
S
PFOUTS' STORE WHERE DAVIS WAS AND
APOLOGIZED FOR HIS CONDUCT SAYING THAT HE WOULD TAKE IT ALL BACK
THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN NOW WHEELED INTO WALLACE STREET AND MARCHED
UP AT QUICK TIME
HALTING IN FRONT OF THE STORE THE EXECUTIVE
OFFICER OF THE COMMITTEE STEPPED FORWARD AND ARRESTED SLADE WHO WAS
AT ONCE INFORMED OF HIS DOOM AND INQUIRY WAS MADE AS TO WHETHER HE
HAD ANY BUSINESS TO SETTLE
SEVERAL PARTIES SPOKE TO HIM ON THE
SUBJECT BUT TO ALL SUCH INQUIRIES HE TURNED A DEAF EAR BEING
ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN THE TERRIFYING REFLECTIONS ON HIS OWN AWFUL
POSITION
HE NEVER CEASED HIS ENTREATIES FOR LIFE AND TO SEE HIS
DEAR WIFE
THE UNFORTUNATE LADY REFERRED TO BETWEEN WHOM AND SLADE
THERE EXISTED A WARM AFFECTION WAS AT THIS TIME LIVING AT THEIR
RANCH ON THE MADISON
SHE WAS POSSESSED OF CONSIDERABLE PERSONAL
ATTRACTIONS TALL WELL FORMED OF GRACEFUL CARRIAGE PLEASING
MANNERS AND WAS WITHAL AN ACCOMPLISHED HORSEWOMAN
A MESSENGER FROM SLADE RODE AT FULL SPEED TO INFORM HER OF HER
HUSBAND'S ARREST
IN AN INSTANT SHE WAS IN THE SADDLE AND WITH ALL
THE ENERGY THAT LOVE AND DESPAIR COULD LEND TO AN ARDENT TEMPERAMENT
AND A STRONG PHYSIQUE SHE URGED HER FLEET CHARGER OVER THE TWELVE
MILES OF ROUGH AND ROCKY GROUND THAT INTERVENED BETWEEN HER AND THE
OBJECT OF HER PASSIONATE DEVOTION
MEANWHILE A PARTY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD MADE THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS
FOR THE EXECUTION IN THE VALLEY TRAVERSED BY THE BRANCH
BENEATH
THE SITE OF PFOUTS AND RUSSELL'S STONE BUILDING THERE WAS A CORRAL
THE GATE POSTS OF WHICH WERE STRONG AND HIGH
ACROSS THE TOP WAS
LAID A BEAM TO WHICH THE ROPE WAS FASTENED AND A DRY GOODS BOX
SERVED FOR THE PLATFORM
TO THIS PLACE SLADE WAS MARCHED
SURROUNDED BY A GUARD COMPOSING THE BEST ARMED AND MOST NUMEROUS
FORCE THAT HAS EVER APPEARED IN MONTANA TERRITORY
THE DOOMED MAN HAD SO EXHAUSTED HIMSELF BY TEARS PRAYERS AND
LAMENTATIONS THAT HE HAD SCARCELY STRENGTH LEFT TO STAND UNDER THE
FATAL BEAM
HE REPEATEDLY EXCLAIMED MY GOD MY GOD MUST I DIE
OH MY DEAR WIFE
ON THE RETURN OF THE FATIGUE PARTY THEY ENCOUNTERED SOME FRIENDS OF
SLADE STAUNCH AND RELIABLE CITIZENS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE
BUT WHO WERE PERSONALLY ATTACHED TO THE CONDEMNED
ON HEARING OF
HIS SENTENCE ONE OF THEM A STOUT HEARTED MAN PULLED OUT HIS
HANDKERCHIEF AND WALKED AWAY WEEPING LIKE A CHILD
SLADE STILL
BEGGED TO SEE HIS WIFE MOST PITEOUSLY AND IT SEEMED HARD TO DENY
HIS REQUEST BUT THE BLOODY CONSEQUENCES THAT WERE SURE TO FOLLOW
THE INEVITABLE ATTEMPT AT A RESCUE THAT HER PRESENCE AND ENTREATIES
WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY INCITED FORBADE THE GRANTING OF HIS REQUEST
SEVERAL GENTLEMEN WERE SENT FOR TO SEE HIM IN HIS LAST MOMENTS ONE
OF WHOM JUDGE DAVIS MADE A SHORT ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE BUT IN
SUCH LOW TONES AS TO BE INAUDIBLE SAVE TO A FEW IN HIS IMMEDIATE
VICINITY
ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AFTER EXHAUSTING HIS POWERS OF
ENTREATY THREW OFF HIS COAT AND DECLARED THAT THE PRISONER COULD
NOT BE HANGED UNTIL HE HIMSELF WAS KILLED
A HUNDRED GUNS WERE
INSTANTLY LEVELED AT HIM WHEREUPON HE TURNED AND FLED BUT BEING
BROUGHT BACK HE WAS COMPELLED TO RESUME HIS COAT AND TO GIVE A
PROMISE OF FUTURE PEACEABLE DEMEANOR
SCARCELY A LEADING MAN IN VIRGINIA COULD BE FOUND THOUGH NUMBERS OF
THE CITIZENS JOINED THE RANKS OF THE GUARD WHEN THE ARREST WAS MADE
ALL LAMENTED THE STERN NECESSITY WHICH DICTATED THE EXECUTION
EVERYTHING BEING READY THE COMMAND WAS GIVEN MEN DO YOUR DUTY
AND THE BOX BEING INSTANTLY SLIPPED FROM BENEATH HIS FEET HE DIED
ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY
THE BODY WAS CUT DOWN AND CARRIED TO THE VIRGINIA HOTEL WHERE IN A
DARKENED ROOM IT WAS SCARCELY LAID OUT WHEN THE UNFORTUNATE AND
BEREAVED COMPANION OF THE DECEASED ARRIVED AT HEADLONG SPEED TO
FIND THAT ALL WAS OVER AND THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW
HER GRIEF AND
HEART PIERCING CRIES WERE TERRIBLE EVIDENCES OF THE DEPTH OF HER
ATTACHMENT FOR HER LOST HUSBAND AND A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
BEFORE SHE COULD REGAIN THE COMMAND OF HER EXCITED FEELINGS
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE DESPERADO NATURE THAT IS WHOLLY
UNACCOUNTABLE AT LEAST IT LOOKS UNACCOUNTABLE
IT IS THIS
THE TRUE
DESPERADO IS GIFTED WITH SPLENDID COURAGE AND YET HE WILL TAKE THE MOST
INFAMOUS ADVANTAGE OF HIS ENEMY ARMED AND FREE HE WILL STAND UP BEFORE
A HOST AND FIGHT UNTIL HE IS SHOT ALL TO PIECES AND YET WHEN HE IS UNDER
THE GALLOWS AND HELPLESS HE WILL CRY AND PLEAD LIKE A CHILD
WORDS ARE
CHEAP AND IT IS EASY TO CALL SLADE A COWARD ALL EXECUTED MEN WHO DO NOT
DIE GAME ARE PROMPTLY CALLED COWARDS BY UNREFLECTING PEOPLE AND WHEN
WE READ OF SLADE THAT HE HAD SO EXHAUSTED HIMSELF BY TEARS PRAYERS AND
LAMENTATIONS THAT HE HAD SCARCELY STRENGTH LEFT TO STAND UNDER THE FATAL
BEAM THE DISGRACEFUL WORD SUGGESTS ITSELF IN A MOMENT YET IN
FREQUENTLY DEFYING AND INVITING THE VENGEANCE OF BANDED ROCKY MOUNTAIN
CUT THROATS BY SHOOTING DOWN THEIR COMRADES AND LEADERS AND NEVER
OFFERING TO HIDE OR FLY SLADE SHOWED THAT HE WAS A MAN OF PEERLESS
BRAVERY
NO COWARD WOULD DARE THAT
MANY A NOTORIOUS COWARD MANY A
CHICKEN LIVERED POLTROON COARSE BRUTAL DEGRADED HAS MADE HIS DYING
SPEECH WITHOUT A QUAVER IN HIS VOICE AND BEEN SWUNG INTO ETERNITY WITH
WHAT LOOKED LIKED THE CALMEST FORTITUDE AND SO WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN
BELIEVING FROM THE LOW INTELLECT OF SUCH A CREATURE THAT IT WAS NOT
MORAL COURAGE THAT ENABLED HIM TO DO IT
THEN IF MORAL COURAGE IS NOT
THE REQUISITE QUALITY WHAT COULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT THIS STOUT HEARTED
SLADE LACKED THIS BLOODY DESPERATE KINDLY MANNERED URBANE GENTLEMAN
WHO NEVER HESITATED TO WARN HIS MOST RUFFIANLY ENEMIES THAT HE WOULD KILL
THEM WHENEVER OR WHEREVER HE CAME ACROSS THEM NEXT I THINK IT IS A
CONUNDRUM WORTH INVESTIGATING
CHAPTER XII
JUST BEYOND THE BREAKFAST STATION WE OVERTOOK A MORMON EMIGRANT TRAIN OF
THIRTY THREE WAGONS AND TRAMPING WEARILY ALONG AND DRIVING THEIR HERD OF
LOOSE COWS WERE DOZENS OF COARSE CLAD AND SAD LOOKING MEN WOMEN AND
CHILDREN WHO HAD WALKED AS THEY WERE WALKING NOW DAY AFTER DAY FOR
EIGHT LINGERING WEEKS AND IN THAT TIME HAD COMPASSED THE DISTANCE OUR
STAGE HAD COME IN EIGHT DAYS AND THREE HOURS SEVEN HUNDRED AND
NINETY EIGHT MILES THEY WERE DUSTY AND UNCOMBED HATLESS BONNETLESS
AND RAGGED AND THEY DID LOOK SO TIRED
AFTER BREAKFAST WE BATHED IN HORSE CREEK A PREVIOUSLY LIMPID
SPARKLING STREAM AN APPRECIATED LUXURY FOR IT WAS VERY SELDOM THAT OUR
FURIOUS COACH HALTED LONG ENOUGH FOR AN INDULGENCE OF THAT KIND
WE
CHANGED HORSES TEN OR TWELVE TIMES IN EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS CHANGED
MULES RATHER SIX MULES AND DID IT NEARLY EVERY TIME IN FOUR MINUTES
IT WAS LIVELY WORK
AS OUR COACH RATTLED UP TO EACH STATION SIX
HARNESSED MULES STEPPED GAYLY FROM THE STABLE AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN
EYE ALMOST THE OLD TEAM WAS OUT AND THE NEW ONE IN AND WE OFF AND AWAY
AGAIN
DURING THE AFTERNOON WE PASSED SWEETWATER CREEK INDEPENDENCE ROCK
DEVIL'S GATE AND THE DEVIL'S GAP
THE LATTER WERE WILD SPECIMENS OF
RUGGED SCENERY AND FULL OF INTEREST WE WERE IN THE HEART OF THE ROCKY
MOUNTAINS NOW
AND WE ALSO PASSED BY ALKALI OR SODA LAKE AND WE
WOKE UP TO THE FACT THAT OUR JOURNEY HAD STRETCHED A LONG WAY ACROSS THE
WORLD WHEN THE DRIVER SAID THAT THE MORMONS OFTEN CAME THERE FROM GREAT
SALT LAKE CITY TO HAUL AWAY SALERATUS
HE SAID THAT A FEW DAYS GONE BY
THEY HAD SHOVELED UP ENOUGH PURE SALERATUS FROM THE GROUND IT WAS A DRY
LAKE TO LOAD TWO WAGONS AND THAT WHEN THEY GOT THESE TWO WAGONS LOADS
OF A DRUG THAT COST THEM NOTHING TO SALT LAKE THEY COULD SELL IT FOR
TWENTY FIVE CENTS A POUND
IN THE NIGHT WE SAILED BY A MOST NOTABLE CURIOSITY AND ONE WE HAD BEEN
HEARING A GOOD DEAL ABOUT FOR A DAY OR TWO AND WERE SUFFERING TO SEE
THIS WAS WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A NATURAL ICE HOUSE
IT WAS AUGUST NOW
AND SWELTERING WEATHER IN THE DAYTIME YET AT ONE OF THE STATIONS THE MEN
COULD SCAPE THE SOIL ON THE HILL SIDE UNDER THE LEE OF A RANGE OF
BOULDERS AND AT A DEPTH OF SIX INCHES CUT OUT PURE BLOCKS OF ICE HARD
COMPACTLY FROZEN AND CLEAR AS CRYSTAL
TOWARD DAWN WE GOT UNDER WAY AGAIN AND PRESENTLY AS WE SAT WITH RAISED
CURTAINS ENJOYING OUR EARLY MORNING SMOKE AND CONTEMPLATING THE FIRST
SPLENDOR OF THE RISING SUN AS IT SWEPT DOWN THE LONG ARRAY OF MOUNTAIN
PEAKS FLUSHING AND GILDING CRAG AFTER CRAG AND SUMMIT AFTER SUMMIT AS
IF THE INVISIBLE CREATOR REVIEWED HIS GRAY VETERANS AND THEY SALUTED WITH
A SMILE WE HOVE IN SIGHT OF SOUTH PASS CITY
THE HOTEL KEEPER THE
POSTMASTER THE BLACKSMITH THE MAYOR THE CONSTABLE THE CITY MARSHAL
AND THE PRINCIPAL CITIZEN AND PROPERTY HOLDER ALL CAME OUT AND GREETED
US CHEERILY AND WE GAVE HIM GOOD DAY
HE GAVE US A LITTLE INDIAN NEWS
AND A LITTLE ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS AND WE GAVE HIM SOME PLAINS INFORMATION
IN RETURN
HE THEN RETIRED TO HIS LONELY GRANDEUR AND WE CLIMBED ON UP
AMONG THE BRISTLING PEAKS AND THE RAGGED CLOUDS
SOUTH PASS CITY
CONSISTED OF FOUR LOG CABINS ONE IF WHICH WAS UNFINISHED AND THE
GENTLEMAN WITH ALL THOSE OFFICES AND TITLES WAS THE CHIEFEST OF THE TEN
CITIZENS OF THE PLACE
THINK OF HOTEL KEEPER POSTMASTER BLACKSMITH
MAYOR CONSTABLE CITY MARSHAL AND PRINCIPAL CITIZEN ALL CONDENSED INTO
ONE PERSON AND CRAMMED INTO ONE SKIN
BEMIS SAID HE WAS A PERFECT
ALLEN'S REVOLVER OF DIGNITIES AND HE SAID THAT IF HE WERE TO DIE AS
POSTMASTER OR AS BLACKSMITH OR AS POSTMASTER AND BLACKSMITH BOTH THE
PEOPLE MIGHT STAND IT BUT IF HE WERE TO DIE ALL OVER IT WOULD BE A
FRIGHTFUL LOSS TO THE COMMUNITY
TWO MILES BEYOND SOUTH PASS CITY WE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT
MYSTERIOUS MARVEL WHICH ALL WESTERN UNTRAVELED BOYS HAVE HEARD OF AND
FULLY BELIEVE IN BUT ARE SURE TO BE ASTOUNDED AT WHEN THEY SEE IT WITH
THEIR OWN EYES NEVERTHELESS BANKS OF SNOW IN DEAD SUMMER TIME
WE WERE
NOW FAR UP TOWARD THE SKY AND KNEW ALL THE TIME THAT WE MUST PRESENTLY
ENCOUNTER LOFTY SUMMITS CLAD IN THE ETERNAL SNOW WHICH WAS SO COMMON
PLACE A MATTER OF MENTION IN BOOKS AND YET WHEN I DID SEE IT GLITTERING
IN THE SUN ON STATELY DOMES IN THE DISTANCE AND KNEW THE MONTH WAS AUGUST
AND THAT MY COAT WAS HANGING UP BECAUSE IT WAS TOO WARM TO WEAR IT I WAS
FULL AS MUCH AMAZED AS IF I NEVER HAD HEARD OF SNOW IN AUGUST BEFORE
TRULY SEEING IS BELIEVING AND MANY A MAN LIVES A LONG LIFE THROUGH
THINKING HE BELIEVES CERTAIN UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED AND WELL ESTABLISHED
THINGS AND YET NEVER SUSPECTS THAT IF HE WERE CONFRONTED BY THOSE THINGS
ONCE HE WOULD DISCOVER THAT HE DID NOT REALLY BELIEVE THEM BEFORE BUT
ONLY THOUGHT HE BELIEVED THEM
IN A LITTLE WHILE QUITE A NUMBER OF PEAKS SWUNG INTO VIEW WITH LONG CLAWS
OF GLITTERING SNOW CLASPING THEM AND WITH HERE AND THERE IN THE SHADE
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE A LITTLE SOLITARY PATCH OF SNOW LOOKING NO LARGER
THAN A LADY'S POCKET HANDKERCHIEF BUT BEING IN REALITY AS LARGE AS A
PUBLIC SQUARE
AND NOW AT LAST WE WERE FAIRLY IN THE RENOWNED SOUTH PASS AND WHIRLING
GAYLY ALONG HIGH ABOVE THE COMMON WORLD
WE WERE PERCHED UPON THE
EXTREME SUMMIT OF THE GREAT RANGE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS TOWARD WHICH WE
HAD BEEN CLIMBING PATIENTLY CLIMBING CEASELESSLY CLIMBING FOR DAYS AND
NIGHTS TOGETHER AND ABOUT US WAS GATHERED A CONVENTION OF NATURE'S KINGS
THAT STOOD TEN TWELVE AND EVEN THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH GRAND OLD
FELLOWS WHO WOULD HAVE TO STOOP TO SEE MOUNT WASHINGTON IN THE TWILIGHT
WE WERE IN SUCH AN AIRY ELEVATION ABOVE THE CREEPING POPULATIONS OF THE
EARTH THAT NOW AND THEN WHEN THE OBSTRUCTING CRAGS STOOD OUT OF THE WAY
IT SEEMED THAT WE COULD LOOK AROUND AND ABROAD AND CONTEMPLATE THE WHOLE
GREAT GLOBE WITH ITS DISSOLVING VIEWS OF MOUNTAINS SEAS AND CONTINENTS
STRETCHING AWAY THROUGH THE MYSTERY OF THE SUMMER HAZE
AS A GENERAL THING THE PASS WAS MORE SUGGESTIVE OF A VALLEY THAN A
SUSPENSION BRIDGE IN THE CLOUDS BUT IT STRONGLY SUGGESTED THE LATTER AT
ONE SPOT
AT THAT PLACE THE UPPER THIRD OF ONE OR TWO MAJESTIC PURPLE
DOMES PROJECTED ABOVE OUR LEVEL ON EITHER HAND AND GAVE US A SENSE OF A
HIDDEN GREAT DEEP OF MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS AND VALLEYS DOWN ABOUT THEIR
BASES WHICH WE FANCIED WE MIGHT SEE IF WE COULD STEP TO THE EDGE AND LOOK
OVER
THESE SULTANS OF THE FASTNESSES WERE TURBANED WITH TUMBLED VOLUMES
OF CLOUD WHICH SHREDDED AWAY FROM TIME TO TIME AND DRIFTED OFF FRINGED
AND TORN TRAILING THEIR CONTINENTS OF SHADOW AFTER THEM AND CATCHING
PRESENTLY ON AN INTERCEPTING PEAK WRAPPED IT ABOUT AND BROODED THERE
THEN SHREDDED AWAY AGAIN AND LEFT THE PURPLE PEAK AS THEY HAD LEFT THE
PURPLE DOMES DOWNY AND WHITE WITH NEW LAID SNOW
IN PASSING THESE
MONSTROUS RAGS OF CLOUD HUNG LOW AND SWEPT ALONG RIGHT OVER THE
SPECTATOR'S HEAD SWINGING THEIR TATTERS SO NEARLY IN HIS FACE THAT HIS
IMPULSE WAS TO SHRINK WHEN THEY CAME CLOSET
IN THE ONE PLACE I SPEAK
OF ONE COULD LOOK BELOW HIM UPON A WORLD OF DIMINISHING CRAGS AND
CANYONS LEADING DOWN DOWN AND AWAY TO A VAGUE PLAIN WITH A THREAD IN IT
WHICH WAS A ROAD AND BUNCHES OF FEATHERS IN IT WHICH WERE TREES A
PRETTY PICTURE SLEEPING IN THE SUNLIGHT BUT WITH A DARKNESS STEALING
OVER IT AND GLOOMING ITS FEATURES DEEPER AND DEEPER UNDER THE FROWN OF A
COMING STORM AND THEN WHILE NO FILM OR SHADOW MARRED THE NOON
BRIGHTNESS OF HIS HIGH PERCH HE COULD WATCH THE TEMPEST BREAK FORTH DOWN
THERE AND SEE THE LIGHTNINGS LEAP FROM CRAG TO CRAG AND THE SHEETED RAIN
DRIVE ALONG THE CANYON SIDES AND HEAR THE THUNDERS PEAL AND CRASH AND
ROAR
WE HAD THIS SPECTACLE A FAMILIAR ONE TO MANY BUT TO US A
NOVELTY
WE BOWLED ALONG CHEERILY AND PRESENTLY AT THE VERY SUMMIT THOUGH IT
HAD BEEN ALL SUMMIT TO US AND ALL EQUALLY LEVEL FOR HALF AN HOUR OR
MORE WE CAME TO A SPRING WHICH SPENT ITS WATER THROUGH TWO OUTLETS AND
SENT IT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS
THE CONDUCTOR SAID THAT ONE OF THOSE
STREAMS WHICH WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS JUST STARTING ON A JOURNEY WESTWARD
TO THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN THROUGH HUNDREDS AND
EVEN THOUSANDS OF MILES OF DESERT SOLITUDES
HE SAID THAT THE OTHER WAS
JUST LEAVING ITS HOME AMONG THE SNOW PEAKS ON A SIMILAR JOURNEY EASTWARD
AND WE KNEW THAT LONG AFTER WE SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN THE SIMPLE RIVULET
IT WOULD STILL BE PLODDING ITS PATIENT WAY DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDES AND
CANYON BEDS AND BETWEEN THE BANKS OF THE YELLOWSTONE AND BY AND BY
WOULD JOIN THE BROAD MISSOURI AND FLOW THROUGH UNKNOWN PLAINS AND DESERTS
AND UNVISITED WILDERNESSES AND ADD A LONG AND TROUBLED PILGRIMAGE AMONG
SNAGS AND WRECKS AND SANDBARS AND ENTER THE MISSISSIPPI TOUCH THE
WHARVES OF ST
LOUIS AND STILL DRIFT ON TRAVERSING SHOALS AND ROCKY
CHANNELS THEN ENDLESS CHAINS OF BOTTOMLESS AND AMPLE BENDS WALLED WITH
UNBROKEN FORESTS THEN MYSTERIOUS BYWAYS AND SECRET PASSAGES AMONG WOODY
ISLANDS THEN THE CHAINED BENDS AGAIN BORDERED WITH WIDE LEVELS OF
SHINING SUGAR CANE IN PLACE OF THE SOMBRE FORESTS THEN BY NEW ORLEANS
AND STILL OTHER CHAINS OF BENDS AND FINALLY AFTER TWO LONG MONTHS OF
DAILY AND NIGHTLY HARASSMENT EXCITEMENT ENJOYMENT ADVENTURE AND AWFUL
PERIL OF PARCHED THROATS PUMPS AND EVAPORATION PASS THE GULF AND ENTER
INTO ITS REST UPON THE BOSOM OF THE TROPIC SEA NEVER TO LOOK UPON ITS
SNOW PEAKS AGAIN OR REGRET THEM
I FREIGHTED A LEAF WITH A MENTAL MESSAGE FOR THE FRIENDS AT HOME AND
DROPPED IT IN THE STREAM
BUT I PUT NO STAMP ON IT AND IT WAS HELD FOR
POSTAGE SOMEWHERE
ON THE SUMMIT WE OVERTOOK AN EMIGRANT TRAIN OF MANY WAGONS MANY TIRED
MEN AND WOMEN AND MANY A DISGUSTED SHEEP AND COW
IN THE WOFULLY DUSTY HORSEMAN IN CHARGE OF THE EXPEDITION I RECOGNIZED
JOHN
OF ALL PERSONS IN THE WORLD TO MEET ON TOP OF THE ROCKY
MOUNTAINS THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM HOME HE WAS THE LAST ONE I SHOULD HAVE
LOOKED FOR
WE WERE SCHOOL BOYS TOGETHER AND WARM FRIENDS FOR YEARS
BUT A BOYISH PRANK OF MINE HAD DISRUPTURED THIS FRIENDSHIP AND IT HAD
NEVER BEEN RENEWED
THE ACT OF WHICH I SPEAK WAS THIS
I HAD BEEN
ACCUSTOMED TO VISIT OCCASIONALLY AN EDITOR WHOSE ROOM WAS IN THE THIRD
STORY OF A BUILDING AND OVERLOOKED THE STREET
ONE DAY THIS EDITOR GAVE
ME A WATERMELON WHICH I MADE PREPARATIONS TO DEVOUR ON THE SPOT BUT
CHANCING TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOW I SAW JOHN STANDING DIRECTLY UNDER IT
AND AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE CAME UPON ME TO DROP THE MELON ON HIS HEAD
WHICH I IMMEDIATELY DID
I WAS THE LOSER FOR IT SPOILED THE MELON AND
JOHN NEVER FORGAVE ME AND WE DROPPED ALL INTERCOURSE AND PARTED BUT NOW
MET AGAIN UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
WE RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HANDS WERE GRASPED AS WARMLY
AS IF NO COLDNESS HAD EVER EXISTED BETWEEN US AND NO ALLUSION WAS MADE
TO ANY
ALL ANIMOSITIES WERE BURIED AND THE SIMPLE FACT OF MEETING A
FAMILIAR FACE IN THAT ISOLATED SPOT SO FAR FROM HOME WAS SUFFICIENT TO
MAKE US FORGET ALL THINGS BUT PLEASANT ONES AND WE PARTED AGAIN WITH
SINCERE GOOD BYE AND GOD BLESS YOU FROM BOTH
WE HAD BEEN CLIMBING UP THE LONG SHOULDERS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS FOR
MANY TEDIOUS HOURS WE STARTED DOWN THEM NOW
AND WE WENT SPINNING AWAY
AT A ROUND RATE TOO
WE LEFT THE SNOWY WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS AND UINTA MOUNTAINS BEHIND AND
SPED AWAY ALWAYS THROUGH SPLENDID SCENERY BUT OCCASIONALLY THROUGH LONG
RANKS OF WHITE SKELETONS OF MULES AND OXEN MONUMENTS OF THE HUGE
EMIGRATION OF OTHER DAYS AND HERE AND THERE WERE UP ENDED BOARDS OR
SMALL PILES OF STONES WHICH THE DRIVER SAID MARKED THE RESTING PLACE OF
MORE PRECIOUS REMAINS
IT WAS THE LONELIEST LAND FOR A GRAVE A LAND GIVEN OVER TO THE CAYOTE
AND THE RAVEN WHICH IS BUT ANOTHER NAME FOR DESOLATION AND UTTER
SOLITUDE
ON DAMP MURKY NIGHTS THESE SCATTERED SKELETONS GAVE FORTH A
SOFT HIDEOUS GLOW LIKE VERY FAINT SPOTS OF MOONLIGHT STARRING THE VAGUE
DESERT
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PHOSPHORUS IN THE BONES
BUT NO
SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION COULD KEEP A BODY FROM SHIVERING WHEN HE DRIFTED
BY ONE OF THOSE GHOSTLY LIGHTS AND KNEW THAT A SKULL HELD IT
AT MIDNIGHT IT BEGAN TO RAIN AND I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT INDEED I
DID NOT EVEN SEE THIS FOR IT WAS TOO DARK
WE FASTENED DOWN THE
CURTAINS AND EVEN CAULKED THEM WITH CLOTHING BUT THE RAIN STREAMED IN IN
TWENTY PLACES NOTHWITHSTANDING
THERE WAS NO ESCAPE
IF ONE MOVED HIS
FEET OUT OF A STREAM HE BROUGHT HIS BODY UNDER ONE AND IF HE MOVED HIS
BODY HE CAUGHT ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE
IF HE STRUGGLED OUT OF THE DRENCHED
BLANKETS AND SAT UP HE WAS BOUND TO GET ONE DOWN THE BACK OF HIS NECK
MEANTIME THE STAGE WAS WANDERING ABOUT A PLAIN WITH GAPING GULLIES IN IT
FOR THE DRIVER COULD NOT SEE AN INCH BEFORE HIS FACE NOR KEEP THE ROAD
AND THE STORM PELTED SO PITILESSLY THAT THERE WAS NO KEEPING THE HORSES
STILL
WITH THE FIRST ABATEMENT THE CONDUCTOR TURNED OUT WITH LANTERNS
TO LOOK FOR THE ROAD AND THE FIRST DASH HE MADE WAS INTO A CHASM ABOUT
FOURTEEN FEET DEEP HIS LANTERN FOLLOWING LIKE A METEOR
AS SOON AS HE
TOUCHED BOTTOM HE SANG OUT FRANTICALLY
DON'T COME HERE
TO WHICH THE DRIVER WHO WAS LOOKING OVER THE PRECIPICE WHERE HE HAD
DISAPPEARED REPLIED WITH AN INJURED AIR THINK I'M A DAM FOOL
THE CONDUCTOR WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR FINDING THE ROAD A MATTER WHICH
SHOWED US HOW FAR WE HAD WANDERED AND WHAT CHANCES WE HAD BEEN TAKING
HE TRACED OUR WHEEL TRACKS TO THE IMMINENT VERGE OF DANGER IN TWO
PLACES
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GLAD THAT WE WERE NOT KILLED THAT NIGHT
I DO NOT KNOW ANY PARTICULAR REASON BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GLAD
IN THE MORNING THE TENTH DAY OUT WE CROSSED GREEN RIVER A FINE LARGE
LIMPID STREAM STUCK IN IT WITH THE WATER JUST UP TO THE TOP OF OUR
MAIL BED AND WAITED TILL EXTRA TEAMS WERE PUT ON TO HAUL US UP THE STEEP
BANK
BUT IT WAS NICE COOL WATER AND BESIDES IT COULD NOT FIND ANY
FRESH PLACE ON US TO WET
AT THE GREEN RIVER STATION WE HAD BREAKFAST HOT BISCUITS FRESH ANTELOPE
STEAKS AND COFFEE THE ONLY DECENT MEAL WE TASTED BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND GREAT SALT LAKE CITY AND THE ONLY ONE WE WERE EVER REALLY
THANKFUL FOR
THINK OF THE MONOTONOUS EXECRABLENESS OF THE THIRTY THAT WENT BEFORE IT
TO LEAVE THIS ONE SIMPLE BREAKFAST LOOMING UP IN MY MEMORY LIKE A
SHOT TOWER AFTER ALL THESE YEARS HAVE GONE BY
AT FIVE P M
WE REACHED FORT BRIDGER ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILES
FROM THE SOUTH PASS AND ONE THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE MILES FROM ST
JOSEPH
FIFTY TWO MILES FURTHER ON NEAR THE HEAD OF ECHO CANYON WE MET
SIXTY UNITED STATES SOLDIERS FROM CAMP FLOYD
THE DAY BEFORE THEY HAD
FIRED UPON THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED INDIANS WHOM THEY SUPPOSED
GATHERED TOGETHER FOR NO GOOD PURPOSE
IN THE FIGHT THAT HAD ENSUED
FOUR INDIANS WERE CAPTURED AND THE MAIN BODY CHASED FOUR MILES BUT
NOBODY KILLED
THIS LOOKED LIKE BUSINESS
WE HAD A NOTION TO GET OUT
AND JOIN THE SIXTY SOLDIERS BUT UPON REFLECTING THAT THERE WERE FOUR
HUNDRED OF THE INDIANS WE CONCLUDED TO GO ON AND JOIN THE INDIANS
ECHO CANYON IS TWENTY MILES LONG
IT WAS LIKE A LONG SMOOTH NARROW
STREET WITH A GRADUAL DESCENDING GRADE AND SHUT IN BY ENORMOUS
PERPENDICULAR WALLS OF COARSE CONGLOMERATE FOUR HUNDRED FEET HIGH IN
MANY PLACES AND TURRETED LIKE MEDIAEVAL CASTLES
THIS WAS THE MOST
FAULTLESS PIECE OF ROAD IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE DRIVER SAID HE WOULD
LET HIS TEAM OUT HE DID AND IF THE PACIFIC EXPRESS TRAINS WHIZ
THROUGH THERE NOW ANY FASTER THAN WE DID THEN IN THE STAGE COACH I ENVY
THE PASSENGERS THE EXHILARATION OF IT
WE FAIRLY SEEMED TO PICK UP OUR
WHEELS AND FLY AND THE MAIL MATTER WAS LIFTED UP FREE FROM EVERYTHING
AND HELD IN SOLUTION I AM NOT GIVEN TO EXAGGERATION AND WHEN I SAY A
THING I MEAN IT
HOWEVER TIME PRESSES
AT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON WE ARRIVED ON THE SUMMIT
OF BIG MOUNTAIN FIFTEEN MILES FROM SALT LAKE CITY WHEN ALL THE WORLD
WAS GLORIFIED WITH THE SETTING SUN AND THE MOST STUPENDOUS PANORAMA OF
MOUNTAIN PEAKS YET ENCOUNTERED BURST ON OUR SIGHT
WE LOOKED OUT UPON
THIS SUBLIME SPECTACLE FROM UNDER THE ARCH OF A BRILLIANT RAINBOW EVEN
THE OVERLAND STAGE DRIVER STOPPED HIS HORSES AND GAZED
HALF AN HOUR OR AN HOUR LATER WE CHANGED HORSES AND TOOK SUPPER WITH A
MORMON DESTROYING ANGEL
DESTROYING ANGELS AS I UNDERSTAND IT ARE LATTER DAY SAINTS WHO ARE
SET APART BY THE CHURCH TO CONDUCT PERMANENT DISAPPEARANCES OF OBNOXIOUS
CITIZENS
I HAD HEARD A DEAL ABOUT THESE MORMON DESTROYING ANGELS AND
THE DARK AND BLOODY DEEDS THEY HAD DONE AND WHEN I ENTERED THIS ONE'S
HOUSE I HAD MY SHUDDER ALL READY
BUT ALAS FOR ALL OUR ROMANCES HE WAS
NOTHING BUT A LOUD PROFANE OFFENSIVE OLD BLACKGUARD HE WAS MURDEROUS
ENOUGH POSSIBLY TO FILL THE BILL OF A DESTROYER BUT WOULD YOU HAVE ANY
KIND OF AN ANGEL DEVOID OF DIGNITY COULD YOU ABIDE AN ANGEL IN AN
UNCLEAN SHIRT AND NO SUSPENDERS COULD YOU RESPECT AN ANGEL WITH A
HORSE LAUGH AND A SWAGGER LIKE A BUCCANEER
THERE WERE OTHER BLACKGUARDS PRESENT COMRADES OF THIS ONE
AND THERE
WAS ONE PERSON THAT LOOKED LIKE A GENTLEMAN HEBER C
KIMBALL'S SON TALL
AND WELL MADE AND THIRTY YEARS OLD PERHAPS
A LOT OF SLATTERNLY WOMEN
FLITTED HITHER AND THITHER IN A HURRY WITH COFFEE POTS PLATES OF BREAD
AND OTHER APPURTENANCES TO SUPPER AND THESE WERE SAID TO BE THE WIVES OF
THE ANGEL OR SOME OF THEM AT LEAST
AND OF COURSE THEY WERE FOR IF
THEY HAD BEEN HIRED HELP THEY WOULD NOT HAVE LET AN ANGEL FROM ABOVE
STORM AND SWEAR AT THEM AS HE DID LET ALONE ONE FROM THE PLACE THIS ONE
HAILED FROM
THIS WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE WESTERN PECULIAR INSTITUTION AND
IT WAS NOT VERY PREPOSSESSING
WE DID NOT TARRY LONG TO OBSERVE IT BUT
HURRIED ON TO THE HOME OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THE STRONGHOLD OF THE
PROPHETS THE CAPITAL OF THE ONLY ABSOLUTE MONARCH IN AMERICA GREAT SALT
LAKE CITY
AS THE NIGHT CLOSED IN WE TOOK SANCTUARY IN THE SALT LAKE
HOUSE AND UNPACKED OUR BAGGAGE
CHAPTER XIII
WE HAD A FINE SUPPER OF THE FRESHEST MEATS AND FOWLS AND VEGETABLES A
GREAT VARIETY AND AS GREAT ABUNDANCE
WE WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS SOME
AFTERWARD AND GLANCED IN AT SHOPS AND STORES AND THERE WAS FASCINATION
IN SURREPTITIOUSLY STARING AT EVERY CREATURE WE TOOK TO BE A MORMON
THIS WAS FAIRY LAND TO US TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES A LAND OF
ENCHANTMENT AND GOBLINS AND AWFUL MYSTERY
WE FELT A CURIOSITY TO ASK
EVERY CHILD HOW MANY MOTHERS IT HAD AND IF IT COULD TELL THEM APART AND
WE EXPERIENCED A THRILL EVERY TIME A DWELLING HOUSE DOOR OPENED AND SHUT
AS WE PASSED DISCLOSING A GLIMPSE OF HUMAN HEADS AND BACKS AND
SHOULDERS FOR WE SO LONGED TO HAVE A GOOD SATISFYING LOOK AT A MORMON
FAMILY IN ALL ITS COMPREHENSIVE AMPLENESS DISPOSED IN THE CUSTOMARY
CONCENTRIC RINGS OF ITS HOME CIRCLE
BY AND BY THE ACTING GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY INTRODUCED US TO OTHER
GENTILES AND WE SPENT A SOCIABLE HOUR WITH THEM
GENTILES ARE
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MORMONS
OUR FELLOW PASSENGER BEMIS TOOK CARE OF
HIMSELF DURING THIS PART OF THE EVENING AND DID NOT MAKE AN
OVERPOWERING SUCCESS OF IT EITHER FOR HE CAME INTO OUR ROOM IN THE
HOTEL ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK FULL OF CHEERFULNESS AND TALKING LOOSELY
DISJOINTEDLY AND INDISCRIMINATELY AND EVERY NOW AND THEN TUGGING OUT A
RAGGED WORD BY THE ROOTS THAT HAD MORE HICCUPS THAN SYLLABLES IN IT
THIS TOGETHER WITH HIS HANGING HIS COAT ON THE FLOOR ON ONE SIDE OF A
CHAIR AND HIS VEST ON THE FLOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE AND PILING HIS PANTS
ON THE FLOOR JUST IN FRONT OF THE SAME CHAIR AND THEN COMTEMPLATING THE
GENERAL RESULT WITH SUPERSTITIOUS AWE AND FINALLY PRONOUNCING IT TOO
MANY FOR HIM AND GOING TO BED WITH HIS BOOTS ON LED US TO FEAR THAT
SOMETHING HE HAD EATEN HAD NOT AGREED WITH HIM
BUT WE KNEW AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS SOMETHING HE HAD BEEN DRINKING
IT WAS
THE EXCLUSIVELY MORMON REFRESHER VALLEY TAN
VALLEY TAN OR AT LEAST ONE FORM OF VALLEY TAN IS A KIND OF WHISKY
OR FIRST COUSIN TO IT IS OF MORMON INVENTION AND MANUFACTURED ONLY IN
UTAH
TRADITION SAYS IT IS MADE OF IMPORTED FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
IF I
REMEMBER RIGHTLY NO PUBLIC DRINKING SALOONS WERE ALLOWED IN THE KINGDOM
BY BRIGHAM YOUNG AND NO PRIVATE DRINKING PERMITTED AMONG THE FAITHFUL
EXCEPT THEY CONFINED THEMSELVES TO VALLEY TAN
NEXT DAY WE STROLLED ABOUT EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE BROAD STRAIGHT LEVEL
STREETS AND ENJOYED THE PLEASANT STRANGENESS OF A CITY OF FIFTEEN
THOUSAND INHABITANTS WITH NO LOAFERS PERCEPTIBLE IN IT AND NO VISIBLE
DRUNKARDS OR NOISY PEOPLE A LIMPID STREAM RIPPLING AND DANCING THROUGH
EVERY STREET IN PLACE OF A FILTHY GUTTER BLOCK AFTER BLOCK OF TRIM
DWELLINGS BUILT OF FRAME AND SUNBURNED BRICK A GREAT THRIVING ORCHARD
AND GARDEN BEHIND EVERY ONE OF THEM APPARENTLY BRANCHES FROM THE STREET
STREAM WINDING AND SPARKLING AMONG THE GARDEN BEDS AND FRUIT TREES AND A
GRAND GENERAL AIR OF NEATNESS REPAIR THRIFT AND COMFORT AROUND AND
ABOUT AND OVER THE WHOLE
AND EVERYWHERE WERE WORKSHOPS FACTORIES AND
ALL MANNER OF INDUSTRIES AND INTENT FACES AND BUSY HANDS WERE TO BE SEEN
WHEREVER ONE LOOKED AND IN ONE'S EARS WAS THE CEASELESS CLINK OF
HAMMERS THE BUZZ OF TRADE AND THE CONTENTED HUM OF DRUMS AND FLY WHEELS
THE ARMORIAL CREST OF MY OWN STATE CONSISTED OF TWO DISSOLUTE BEARS
HOLDING UP THE HEAD OF A DEAD AND GONE CASK BETWEEN THEM AND MAKING THE
PERTINENT REMARK UNITED WE STAND HIC DIVIDED WE FALL IT WAS
ALWAYS TOO FIGURATIVE FOR THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK
BUT THE MORMON CREST
WAS EASY
AND IT WAS SIMPLE UNOSTENTATIOUS AND FITTED LIKE A GLOVE
IT WAS A REPRESENTATION OF A GOLDEN BEEHIVE WITH THE BEES ALL AT WORK
THE CITY LIES IN THE EDGE OF A LEVEL PLAIN AS BROAD AS THE STATE OF
CONNECTICUT AND CROUCHES CLOSE DOWN TO THE GROUND UNDER A CURVING WALL
OF MIGHTY MOUNTAINS WHOSE HEADS ARE HIDDEN IN THE CLOUDS AND WHOSE
SHOULDERS BEAR RELICS OF THE SNOWS OF WINTER ALL THE SUMMER LONG
SEEN FROM ONE OF THESE DIZZY HEIGHTS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES OFF GREAT
SALT LAKE CITY IS TONED DOWN AND DIMINISHED TILL IT IS SUGGESTIVE OF A
CHILD'S TOY VILLAGE REPOSING UNDER THE MAJESTIC PROTECTION OF THE CHINESE
WALL
ON SOME OF THOSE MOUNTAINS TO THE SOUTHWEST IT HAD BEEN RAINING EVERY
DAY FOR TWO WEEKS BUT NOT A DROP HAD FALLEN IN THE CITY
AND ON HOT
DAYS IN LATE SPRING AND EARLY AUTUMN THE CITIZENS COULD QUIT FANNING AND
GROWLING AND GO OUT AND COOL OFF BY LOOKING AT THE LUXURY OF A GLORIOUS
SNOW STORM GOING ON IN THE MOUNTAINS
THEY COULD ENJOY IT AT A DISTANCE
AT THOSE SEASONS EVERY DAY THOUGH NO SNOW WOULD FALL IN THEIR STREETS
OR ANYWHERE NEAR THEM
SALT LAKE CITY WAS HEALTHY AN EXTREMELY HEALTHY CITY
THEY DECLARED THERE WAS ONLY ONE PHYSICIAN IN THE PLACE AND HE WAS
ARRESTED EVERY WEEK REGULARLY AND HELD TO ANSWER UNDER THE VAGRANT ACT
FOR HAVING NO VISIBLE MEANS OF SUPPORT THEY ALWAYS GIVE YOU A GOOD
SUBSTANTIAL ARTICLE OF TRUTH IN SALT LAKE AND GOOD MEASURE AND GOOD
WEIGHT TOO
VERY OFTEN IF YOU WISHED TO WEIGH ONE OF THEIR AIRIEST
LITTLE COMMONPLACE STATEMENTS YOU WOULD WANT THE HAY SCALES
WE DESIRED TO VISIT THE FAMOUS INLAND SEA THE AMERICAN DEAD SEA THE
GREAT SALT LAKE SEVENTEEN MILES HORSEBACK FROM THE CITY FOR WE HAD
DREAMED ABOUT IT AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND TALKED ABOUT IT AND YEARNED
TO SEE IT ALL THE FIRST PART OF OUR TRIP BUT NOW WHEN IT WAS ONLY ARM'S
LENGTH AWAY IT HAD SUDDENLY LOST NEARLY EVERY BIT OF ITS INTEREST
AND
SO WE PUT IT OFF IN A SORT OF GENERAL WAY TILL NEXT DAY AND THAT WAS
THE LAST WE EVER THOUGHT OF IT
WE DINED WITH SOME HOSPITABLE GENTILES
AND VISITED THE FOUNDATION OF THE PRODIGIOUS TEMPLE AND TALKED LONG WITH
THAT SHREWD CONNECTICUT YANKEE HEBER C
KIMBALL SINCE DECEASED A
SAINT OF HIGH DEGREE AND A MIGHTY MAN OF COMMERCE
WE SAW THE TITHING HOUSE AND THE LION HOUSE AND I DO NOT KNOW OR
REMEMBER HOW MANY MORE CHURCH AND GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS OF VARIOUS KINDS
AND CURIOUS NAMES
WE FLITTED HITHER AND THITHER AND ENJOYED EVERY HOUR
AND PICKED UP A GREAT DEAL OF USEFUL INFORMATION AND ENTERTAINING
NONSENSE AND WENT TO BED AT NIGHT SATISFIED
THE SECOND DAY WE MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MR
STREET SINCE DECEASED
AND PUT ON WHITE SHIRTS AND WENT AND PAID A STATE VISIT TO THE KING
HE SEEMED A QUIET KINDLY EASY MANNERED DIGNIFIED SELF POSSESSED OLD
GENTLEMAN OF FIFTY FIVE OR SIXTY AND HAD A GENTLE CRAFT IN HIS EYE THAT
PROBABLY BELONGED THERE
HE WAS VERY SIMPLY DRESSED AND WAS JUST TAKING
OFF A STRAW HAT AS WE ENTERED
HE TALKED ABOUT UTAH AND THE INDIANS
AND NEVADA AND GENERAL AMERICAN MATTERS AND QUESTIONS WITH OUR
SECRETARY AND CERTAIN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO CAME WITH US
BUT HE
NEVER PAID ANY ATTENTION TO ME NOTWITHSTANDING I MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS
TO DRAW HIM OUT ON FEDERAL POLITICS AND HIS HIGH HANDED ATTITUDE TOWARD
CONGRESS
I THOUGHT SOME OF THE THINGS I SAID WERE RATHER FINE
BUT HE
MERELY LOOKED AROUND AT ME AT DISTANT INTERVALS SOMETHING AS I HAVE
SEEN A BENIGNANT OLD CAT LOOK AROUND TO SEE WHICH KITTEN WAS MEDDLING
WITH HER TAIL
BY AND BY I SUBSIDED INTO AN INDIGNANT SILENCE AND SO SAT UNTIL THE END
HOT AND FLUSHED AND EXECRATING HIM IN MY HEART FOR AN IGNORANT SAVAGE
BUT HE WAS CALM
HIS CONVERSATION WITH THOSE GENTLEMEN FLOWED ON AS
SWEETLY AND PEACEFULLY AND MUSICALLY AS ANY SUMMER BROOK
WHEN THE
AUDIENCE WAS ENDED AND WE WERE RETIRING FROM THE PRESENCE HE PUT HIS
HAND ON MY HEAD BEAMED DOWN ON ME IN AN ADMIRING WAY AND SAID TO MY
BROTHER
AH YOUR CHILD I PRESUME BOY OR GIRL
CHAPTER XIV
MR
STREET WAS VERY BUSY WITH HIS TELEGRAPHIC MATTERS AND CONSIDERING
THAT HE HAD EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED MILES OF RUGGED SNOWY UNINHABITED
MOUNTAINS AND WATERLESS TREELESS MELANCHOLY DESERTS TO TRAVERSE WITH
HIS WIRE IT WAS NATURAL AND NEEDFUL THAT HE SHOULD BE AS BUSY AS
POSSIBLE
HE COULD NOT GO COMFORTABLY ALONG AND CUT HIS POLES BY THE
ROAD SIDE EITHER BUT THEY HAD TO BE HAULED BY OX TEAMS ACROSS THOSE
EXHAUSTING DESERTS AND IT WAS TWO DAYS' JOURNEY FROM WATER TO WATER IN
ONE OR TWO OF THEM
MR
STREET'S CONTRACT WAS A VAST WORK EVERY WAY ONE
LOOKED AT IT AND YET TO COMPREHEND WHAT THE VAGUE WORDS EIGHT HUNDRED
MILES OF RUGGED MOUNTAINS AND DISMAL DESERTS MEAN ONE MUST GO OVER THE
GROUND IN PERSON PEN AND INK DESCRIPTIONS CANNOT CONVEY THE DREARY
REALITY TO THE READER
AND AFTER ALL MR
S 'S MIGHTIEST DIFFICULTY
TURNED OUT TO BE ONE WHICH HE HAD NEVER TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT AT ALL
UNTO MORMONS HE HAD SUB LET THE HARDEST AND HEAVIEST HALF OF HIS GREAT
UNDERTAKING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
MAKE LITTLE OR NOTHING AND SO THEY TRANQUILLY THREW THEIR POLES
OVERBOARD IN MOUNTAIN OR DESERT JUST AS IT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TOOK THE
NOTION AND DROVE HOME AND WENT ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMARY BUSINESS THEY
WERE UNDER WRITTEN CONTRACT TO MR
STREET BUT THEY DID NOT CARE ANYTHING
FOR THAT
THEY SAID THEY WOULD ADMIRE TO SEE A GENTILE FORCE A
MORMON TO FULFIL A LOSING CONTRACT IN UTAH AND THEY MADE THEMSELVES
VERY MERRY OVER THE MATTER
STREET SAID FOR IT WAS HE THAT TOLD US
THESE THINGS
I WAS IN DISMAY
I WAS UNDER HEAVY BONDS TO COMPLETE MY CONTRACT IN A
GIVEN TIME AND THIS DISASTER LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE RUIN
IT WAS AN
ASTOUNDING THING IT WAS SUCH A WHOLLY UNLOOKED FOR DIFFICULTY THAT I
WAS ENTIRELY NONPLUSSED
I AM A BUSINESS MAN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A
BUSINESS MAN DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING BUT BUSINESS AND SO YOU CAN IMAGINE
HOW LIKE BEING STRUCK BY LIGHTNING IT WAS TO FIND MYSELF IN A COUNTRY
WHERE WRITTEN CONTRACTS WERE WORTHLESS THAT MAIN SECURITY THAT
SHEET ANCHOR THAT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF BUSINESS
MY CONFIDENCE LEFT
ME
THERE WAS NO USE IN MAKING NEW CONTRACTS THAT WAS PLAIN
I TALKED
WITH FIRST ONE PROMINENT CITIZEN AND THEN ANOTHER
THEY ALL SYMPATHIZED
WITH ME FIRST RATE BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO HELP ME
BUT AT LAST A
GENTILE SAID 'GO TO BRIGHAM YOUNG THESE SMALL FRY CANNOT DO YOU ANY
GOOD I DID NOT THINK MUCH OF THE IDEA FOR IF THE LAW COULD NOT HELP
ME WHAT COULD AN INDIVIDUAL DO WHO HAD NOT EVEN ANYTHING TO DO WITH
EITHER MAKING THE LAWS OR EXECUTING THEM HE MIGHT BE A VERY GOOD
PATRIARCH OF A CHURCH AND PREACHER IN ITS TABERNACLE BUT SOMETHING
STERNER THAN RELIGION AND MORAL SUASION WAS NEEDED TO HANDLE A HUNDRED
REFRACTORY HALF CIVILIZED SUB CONTRACTORS
BUT WHAT WAS A MAN TO DO I
THOUGHT IF MR
YOUNG COULD NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE HE MIGHT PROBABLY BE
ABLE TO GIVE ME SOME ADVICE AND A VALUABLE HINT OR TWO AND SO I WENT
STRAIGHT TO HIM AND LAID THE WHOLE CASE BEFORE HIM
HE SAID VERY LITTLE
BUT HE SHOWED STRONG INTEREST ALL THE WAY THROUGH
HE EXAMINED ALL THE
PAPERS IN DETAIL AND WHENEVER THERE SEEMED ANYTHING LIKE A HITCH EITHER
IN THE PAPERS OR MY STATEMENT HE WOULD GO BACK AND TAKE UP THE THREAD
AND FOLLOW IT PATIENTLY OUT TO AN INTELLIGENT AND SATISFACTORY RESULT
THEN HE MADE A LIST OF THE CONTRACTORS' NAMES
FINALLY HE SAID
'MR
STREET THIS IS ALL PERFECTLY PLAIN
THESE CONTRACTS ARE STRICTLY
AND LEGALLY DRAWN AND ARE DULY SIGNED AND CERTIFIED
THESE MEN
MANIFESTLY ENTERED INTO THEM WITH THEIR EYES OPEN
I SEE NO FAULT OR
FLAW ANYWHERE
THEN MR
YOUNG TURNED TO A MAN WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM AND
SAID 'TAKE THIS LIST OF NAMES TO SO AND SO AND TELL HIM TO HAVE THESE
MEN HERE AT SUCH AND SUCH AN HOUR
THEY WERE THERE TO THE MINUTE
SO WAS I
MR
YOUNG ASKED THEM A
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND THEIR ANSWERS MADE MY STATEMENT GOOD
THEN HE
SAID TO THEM
'YOU SIGNED THESE CONTRACTS AND ASSUMED THESE OBLIGATIONS OF YOUR OWN
FREE WILL AND ACCORD
'YES
'THEN CARRY THEM OUT TO THE LETTER IF IT MAKES PAUPERS OF YOU GO
AND THEY DID GO TOO THEY ARE STRUNG ACROSS THE DESERTS NOW WORKING
LIKE BEES
AND I NEVER HEAR A WORD OUT OF THEM
THERE IS A BATCH OF GOVERNORS AND JUDGES AND OTHER OFFICIALS HERE
SHIPPED FROM WASHINGTON AND THEY MAINTAIN THE SEMBLANCE OF A REPUBLICAN
FORM OF GOVERNMENT BUT THE PETRIFIED TRUTH IS THAT UTAH IS AN ABSOLUTE
MONARCHY AND BRIGHAM YOUNG IS KING
MR
STREET WAS A FINE MAN AND I BELIEVE HIS STORY
I KNEW HIM WELL
DURING SEVERAL YEARS AFTERWARD IN SAN FRANCISCO
OUR STAY IN SALT LAKE CITY AMOUNTED TO ONLY TWO DAYS AND THEREFORE WE
HAD NO TIME TO MAKE THE CUSTOMARY INQUISITION INTO THE WORKINGS OF
POLYGAMY AND GET UP THE USUAL STATISTICS AND DEDUCTIONS PREPARATORY TO
CALLING THE ATTENTION OF THE NATION AT LARGE ONCE MORE TO THE MATTER
I HAD THE WILL TO DO IT
WITH THE GUSHING SELF SUFFICIENCY OF YOUTH I
WAS FEVERISH TO PLUNGE IN HEADLONG AND ACHIEVE A GREAT REFORM HERE UNTIL
I SAW THE MORMON WOMEN
THEN I WAS TOUCHED
MY HEART WAS WISER THAN MY
HEAD
IT WARMED TOWARD THESE POOR UNGAINLY AND PATHETICALLY HOMELY
CREATURES AND AS I TURNED TO HIDE THE GENEROUS MOISTURE IN MY EYES I
SAID NO THE MAN THAT MARRIES ONE OF THEM HAS DONE AN ACT OF CHRISTIAN
CHARITY WHICH ENTITLES HIM TO THE KINDLY APPLAUSE OF MANKIND NOT THEIR
HARSH CENSURE AND THE MAN THAT MARRIES SIXTY OF THEM HAS DONE A DEED OF
OPEN HANDED GENEROSITY SO SUBLIME THAT THE NATIONS SHOULD STAND UNCOVERED
IN HIS PRESENCE AND WORSHIP IN SILENCE
FOR A BRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY AND THE NOTED MOUNTAIN MEADOW
MASSACRE SEE APPENDICES A AND B
CHAPTER XV
IT IS A LUSCIOUS COUNTRY FOR THRILLING EVENING STORIES ABOUT
ASSASSINATIONS OF INTRACTABLE GENTILES
I CANNOT EASILY CONCEIVE OF
ANYTHING MORE COSY THAN THE NIGHT IN SALT LAKE WHICH WE SPENT IN A
GENTILE DEN SMOKING PIPES AND LISTENING TO TALES OF HOW BURTON GALLOPED
IN AMONG THE PLEADING AND DEFENCELESS MORISITES AND SHOT THEM DOWN MEN
AND WOMEN LIKE SO MANY DOGS
AND HOW BILL HICKMAN A DESTROYING ANGEL
SHOT DROWN AND ARNOLD DEAD FOR BRINGING SUIT AGAINST HIM FOR A DEBT
AND HOW PORTER ROCKWELL DID THIS AND THAT DREADFUL THING
AND HOW
HEEDLESS PEOPLE OFTEN COME TO UTAH AND MAKE REMARKS ABOUT BRIGHAM OR
POLYGAMY OR SOME OTHER SACRED MATTER AND THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT
DAYLIGHT SUCH PARTIES ARE SURE TO BE FOUND LYING UP SOME BACK ALLEY
CONTENTEDLY WAITING FOR THE HEARSE
AND THE NEXT MOST INTERESTING THING IS TO SIT AND LISTEN TO THESE
GENTILES TALK ABOUT POLYGAMY AND HOW SOME PORTLY OLD FROG OF AN ELDER
OR A BISHOP MARRIES A GIRL LIKES HER MARRIES HER SISTER LIKES HER
MARRIES ANOTHER SISTER LIKES HER TAKES ANOTHER LIKES HER MARRIES HER
MOTHER LIKES HER MARRIES HER FATHER GRANDFATHER GREAT GRANDFATHER
AND THEN COMES BACK HUNGRY AND ASKS FOR MORE
AND HOW THE PERT YOUNG
THING OF ELEVEN WILL CHANCE TO BE THE FAVORITE WIFE AND HER OWN VENERABLE
GRANDMOTHER HAVE TO RANK AWAY DOWN TOWARD D 4 IN THEIR MUTUAL HUSBAND'S
ESTEEM AND HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE KITCHEN AS LIKE AS NOT
AND HOW THIS
DREADFUL SORT OF THING THIS HIVING TOGETHER IN ONE FOUL NEST OF MOTHER
AND DAUGHTERS AND THE MAKING A YOUNG DAUGHTER SUPERIOR TO HER OWN MOTHER
IN RANK AND AUTHORITY ARE THINGS WHICH MORMON WOMEN SUBMIT TO BECAUSE
THEIR RELIGION TEACHES THEM THAT THE MORE WIVES A MAN HAS ON EARTH AND
THE MORE CHILDREN HE REARS THE HIGHER THE PLACE THEY WILL ALL HAVE IN
THE WORLD TO COME AND THE WARMER MAYBE THOUGH THEY DO NOT SEEM TO SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT
ACCORDING TO THESE GENTILE FRIENDS OF OURS BRIGHAM YOUNG'S HAREM
CONTAINS TWENTY OR THIRTY WIVES
THEY SAID THAT SOME OF THEM HAD GROWN
OLD AND GONE OUT OF ACTIVE SERVICE BUT WERE COMFORTABLY HOUSED AND CARED
FOR IN THE HENERY OR THE LION HOUSE AS IT IS STRANGELY NAMED
ALONG
WITH EACH WIFE WERE HER CHILDREN FIFTY ALTOGETHER
THE HOUSE WAS
PERFECTLY QUIET AND ORDERLY WHEN THE CHILDREN WERE STILL
THEY ALL TOOK
THEIR MEALS IN ONE ROOM AND A HAPPY AND HOME LIKE SIGHT IT WAS
PRONOUNCED TO BE
NONE OF OUR PARTY GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE DINNER
WITH MR
YOUNG BUT A GENTILE BY THE NAME OF JOHNSON PROFESSED TO HAVE
ENJOYED A SOCIABLE BREAKFAST IN THE LION HOUSE
HE GAVE A PREPOSTEROUS
ACCOUNT OF THE CALLING OF THE ROLL AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES AND THE
CARNAGE THAT ENSUED WHEN THE BUCKWHEAT CAKES CAME IN
BUT HE EMBELLISHED
RATHER TOO MUCH
HE SAID THAT MR
YOUNG TOLD HIM SEVERAL SMART SAYINGS
OF CERTAIN OF HIS TWO YEAR OLDS OBSERVING WITH SOME PRIDE THAT FOR
MANY YEARS HE HAD BEEN THE HEAVIEST CONTRIBUTOR IN THAT LINE TO ONE OF
THE EASTERN MAGAZINES AND THEN HE WANTED TO SHOW MR
JOHNSON ONE OF THE
PETS THAT HAD SAID THE LAST GOOD THING BUT HE COULD NOT FIND THE CHILD
HE SEARCHED THE FACES OF THE CHILDREN IN DETAIL BUT COULD NOT DECIDE
WHICH ONE IT WAS
FINALLY HE GAVE IT UP WITH A SIGH AND SAID
I THOUGHT I WOULD KNOW THE LITTLE CUB AGAIN BUT I DON'T MR
JOHNSON
SAID FURTHER THAT MR
YOUNG OBSERVED THAT LIFE WAS A SAD SAD THING
BECAUSE THE JOY OF EVERY NEW MARRIAGE A MAN CONTRACTED WAS SO APT TO BE
BLIGHTED BY THE INOPPORTUNE FUNERAL OF A LESS RECENT BRIDE AND MR
JOHNSON SAID THAT WHILE HE AND MR
YOUNG WERE PLEASANTLY CONVERSING IN
PRIVATE ONE OF THE MRS
YOUNGS CAME IN AND DEMANDED A BREAST PIN
REMARKING THAT SHE HAD FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN GIVING A BREAST PIN TO
NO
6 AND SHE FOR ONE DID NOT PROPOSE TO LET THIS PARTIALITY GO ON
WITHOUT MAKING A SATISFACTORY AMOUNT OF TROUBLE ABOUT IT
MR
YOUNG
REMINDED HER THAT THERE WAS A STRANGER PRESENT
MRS
YOUNG SAID THAT IF
THE STATE OF THINGS INSIDE THE HOUSE WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO THE STRANGER
HE COULD FIND ROOM OUTSIDE
MR
YOUNG PROMISED THE BREAST PIN AND SHE
WENT AWAY
BUT IN A MINUTE OR TWO ANOTHER MRS
YOUNG CAME IN AND
DEMANDED A BREAST PIN
MR
YOUNG BEGAN A REMONSTRANCE BUT MRS
YOUNG
CUT HIM SHORT
SHE SAID NO
6 HAD GOT ONE AND NO
11 WAS PROMISED ONE
AND IT WAS NO USE FOR HIM TO TRY TO IMPOSE ON HER SHE HOPED SHE KNEW
HER RIGHTS HE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SHE WENT
AND PRESENTLY THREE
MRS
YOUNGS ENTERED IN A BODY AND OPENED ON THEIR HUSBAND A TEMPEST OF
TEARS ABUSE AND ENTREATY
THEY HAD HEARD ALL ABOUT NO
6 NO
11 AND
NO
14
THREE MORE BREAST PINS WERE PROMISED
THEY WERE HARDLY GONE
WHEN NINE MORE MRS
YOUNGS FILED INTO THE PRESENCE AND A NEW TEMPEST
BURST FORTH AND RAGED ROUND ABOUT THE PROPHET AND HIS GUEST
NINE
BREAST PINS WERE PROMISED AND THE WEIRD SISTERS FILED OUT AGAIN
AND IN
CAME ELEVEN MORE WEEPING AND WAILING AND GNASHING THEIR TEETH
ELEVEN
PROMISED BREAST PINS PURCHASED PEACE ONCE MORE
THAT IS A SPECIMEN SAID MR
YOUNG
YOU SEE HOW IT IS
YOU SEE WHAT
A LIFE I LEAD
A MAN CAN'T BE WISE ALL THE TIME
IN A HEEDLESS MOMENT I
GAVE MY DARLING NO
6 EXCUSE MY CALLING HER THUS AS HER OTHER NAME HAS
ESCAPED ME FOR THE MOMENT A BREAST PIN
IT WAS ONLY WORTH TWENTY FIVE
DOLLARS THAT IS APPARENTLY THAT WAS ITS WHOLE COST BUT ITS ULTIMATE
COST WAS INEVITABLY BOUND TO BE A GOOD DEAL MORE
YOU YOURSELF HAVE SEEN
IT CLIMB UP TO SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND ALAS EVEN THAT IS NOT
THE END FOR I HAVE WIVES ALL OVER THIS TERRITORY OF UTAH
I HAVE
DOZENS OF WIVES WHOSE NUMBERS EVEN I DO NOT KNOW WITHOUT LOOKING IN THE
FAMILY BIBLE
THEY ARE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE AMONG THE MOUNTAINS AND
VALLEYS OF MY REALM
AND MARK YOU EVERY SOLITARY ONE OF THEM WILL HEAR
OF THIS WRETCHED BREAST PIN AND EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM WILL HAVE ONE OR
DIE
NO
6'S BREAST PIN WILL COST ME TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BEFORE
I SEE THE END OF IT
AND THESE CREATURES WILL COMPARE THESE PINS
TOGETHER AND IF ONE IS A SHADE FINER THAN THE REST THEY WILL ALL BE
THROWN ON MY HANDS AND I WILL HAVE TO ORDER A NEW LOT TO KEEP PEACE IN
THE FAMILY
SIR YOU PROBABLY DID NOT KNOW IT BUT ALL THE TIME YOU WERE
PRESENT WITH MY CHILDREN YOUR EVERY MOVEMENT WAS WATCHED BY VIGILANT
SERVITORS OF MINE
IF YOU HAD OFFERED TO GIVE A CHILD A DIME OR A STICK
OF CANDY OR ANY TRIFLE OF THE KIND YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SNATCHED OUT OF
THE HOUSE INSTANTLY PROVIDED IT COULD BE DONE BEFORE YOUR GIFT LEFT YOUR
HAND
OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR YOU TO MAKE AN
EXACTLY SIMILAR GIFT TO ALL MY CHILDREN AND KNOWING BY EXPERIENCE THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE THING I WOULD HAVE STOOD BY AND SEEN TO IT MYSELF THAT
YOU DID IT AND DID IT THOROUGHLY
ONCE A GENTLEMAN GAVE ONE OF MY
CHILDREN A TIN WHISTLE A VERITABLE INVENTION OF SATAN SIR AND ONE
WHICH I HAVE AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR OF AND SO WOULD YOU IF YOU HAD EIGHTY
OR NINETY CHILDREN IN YOUR HOUSE
BUT THE DEED WAS DONE THE MAN
ESCAPED
I KNEW WHAT THE RESULT WAS GOING TO BE AND I THIRSTED FOR
VENGEANCE
I ORDERED OUT A FLOCK OF DESTROYING ANGELS AND THEY HUNTED
THE MAN FAR INTO THE FASTNESSES OF THE NEVADA MOUNTAINS
BUT THEY NEVER
CAUGHT HIM
I AM NOT CRUEL SIR I AM NOT VINDICTIVE EXCEPT WHEN SORELY
OUTRAGED BUT IF I HAD CAUGHT HIM SIR SO HELP ME JOSEPH SMITH I WOULD
HAVE LOCKED HIM INTO THE NURSERY TILL THE BRATS WHISTLED HIM TO DEATH
BY THE SLAUGHTERED BODY OF ST
PARLEY PRATT WHOM GOD ASSAIL THERE
WAS NEVER ANYTHING ON THIS EARTH LIKE IT I KNEW WHO GAVE THE WHISTLE TO
THE CHILD BUT I COULD NOT MAKE THOSE JEALOUS MOTHERS BELIEVE ME
THEY
BELIEVED I DID IT AND THE RESULT WAS JUST WHAT ANY MAN OF REFLECTION
COULD HAVE FORESEEN I HAD TO ORDER A HUNDRED AND TEN WHISTLES I THINK
WE HAD A HUNDRED AND TEN CHILDREN IN THE HOUSE THEN BUT SOME OF THEM ARE
OFF AT COLLEGE NOW I HAD TO ORDER A HUNDRED AND TEN OF THOSE SHRIEKING
THINGS AND I WISH I MAY NEVER SPEAK ANOTHER WORD IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO
TALK ON OUR FINGERS ENTIRELY FROM THAT TIME FORTH UNTIL THE CHILDREN GOT
TIRED OF THE WHISTLES
AND IF EVER ANOTHER MAN GIVES A WHISTLE TO A
CHILD OF MINE AND I GET MY HANDS ON HIM I WILL HANG HIM HIGHER THAN
HAMAN THAT IS THE WORD WITH THE BARK ON IT SHADE OF NEPHI YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MARRIED LIFE
I AM RICH AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
I
AM BENEVOLENT AND EVERYBODY TAKES ADVANTAGE OF IT
I HAVE A STRONG
FATHERLY INSTINCT AND ALL THE FOUNDLINGS ARE FOISTED ON ME
EVERY TIME A WOMAN WANTS TO DO WELL BY HER DARLING SHE PUZZLES HER BRAIN
TO CIPHER OUT SOME SCHEME FOR GETTING IT INTO MY HANDS
WHY SIR A
WOMAN CAME HERE ONCE WITH A CHILD OF A CURIOUS LIFELESS SORT OF
COMPLEXION AND SO HAD THE WOMAN AND SWORE THAT THE CHILD WAS MINE AND
SHE MY WIFE THAT I HAD MARRIED HER AT SUCH AND SUCH A TIME IN
SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE BUT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER NUMBER AND OF COURSE I
COULD NOT REMEMBER HER NAME
WELL SIR SHE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE
FACT THAT THE CHILD LOOKED LIKE ME AND REALLY IT DID SEEM TO RESEMBLE
ME A COMMON THING IN THE TERRITORY AND TO CUT THE STORY SHORT I PUT
IT IN MY NURSERY AND SHE LEFT
AND BY THE GHOST OF ORSON HYDE WHEN
THEY CAME TO WASH THE PAINT OFF THAT CHILD IT WAS AN INJUN BLESS MY
SOUL YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MARRIED LIFE
IT IS A PERFECT DOG'S
LIFE SIR A PERFECT DOG'S LIFE
YOU CAN'T ECONOMIZE
IT ISN'T
POSSIBLE
I HAVE TRIED KEEPING ONE SET OF BRIDAL ATTIRE FOR ALL
OCCASIONS
BUT IT IS OF NO USE
FIRST YOU'LL MARRY A COMBINATION OF
CALICO AND CONSUMPTION THAT'S AS THIN AS A RAIL AND NEXT YOU'LL GET A
CREATURE THAT'S NOTHING MORE THAN THE DROPSY IN DISGUISE AND THEN YOU'VE
GOT TO EKE OUT THAT BRIDAL DRESS WITH AN OLD BALLOON
THAT IS THE WAY IT
GOES
AND THINK OF THE WASH BILL EXCUSE THESE TEARS NINE HUNDRED AND
EIGHTY FOUR PIECES A WEEK NO SIR THERE IS NO SUCH A THING AS ECONOMY
IN A FAMILY LIKE MINE
WHY JUST THE ONE ITEM OF CRADLES THINK OF IT
AND VERMIFUGE SOOTHING SYRUP TEETHING RINGS AND 'PAPA'S WATCHES' FOR
THE BABIES TO PLAY WITH AND THINGS TO SCRATCH THE FURNITURE WITH AND
LUCIFER MATCHES FOR THEM TO EAT AND PIECES OF GLASS TO CUT THEMSELVES
WITH THE ITEM OF GLASS ALONE WOULD SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY I VENTURE TO
SAY SIR
LET ME SCRIMP AND SQUEEZE ALL I CAN I STILL CAN'T GET AHEAD AS
FAST AS I FEEL I OUGHT TO WITH MY OPPORTUNITIES
BLESS YOU SIR AT A
TIME WHEN I HAD SEVENTY TWO WIVES IN THIS HOUSE I GROANED UNDER THE
PRESSURE OF KEEPING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TIED UP IN SEVENTY TWO BEDSTEADS
WHEN THE MONEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN OUT AT INTEREST AND I JUST SOLD OUT
THE WHOLE STOCK SIR AT A SACRIFICE AND BUILT A BEDSTEAD SEVEN FEET
LONG AND NINETY SIX FEET WIDE
BUT IT WAS A FAILURE SIR
I COULD NOT
SLEEP
IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE WHOLE SEVENTY TWO WOMEN SNORED AT ONCE
THE ROAR WAS DEAFENING
AND THEN THE DANGER OF IT THAT WAS WHAT I WAS
LOOKING AT
THEY WOULD ALL DRAW IN THEIR BREATH AT ONCE AND YOU COULD
ACTUALLY SEE THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE SUCK IN AND THEN THEY WOULD ALL
EXHALE THEIR BREATH AT ONCE AND YOU COULD SEE THE WALLS SWELL OUT AND
STRAIN AND HEAR THE RAFTERS CRACK AND THE SHINGLES GRIND TOGETHER
MY
FRIEND TAKE AN OLD MAN'S ADVICE AND DON'T ENCUMBER YOURSELF WITH A
LARGE FAMILY MIND I TELL YOU DON'T DO IT
IN A SMALL FAMILY AND IN A
SMALL FAMILY ONLY YOU WILL FIND THAT COMFORT AND THAT PEACE OF MIND
WHICH ARE THE BEST AT LAST OF THE BLESSINGS THIS WORLD IS ABLE TO AFFORD
US AND FOR THE LACK OF WHICH NO ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH AND NO
ACQUISITION OF FAME POWER AND GREATNESS CAN EVER COMPENSATE US
TAKE MY
WORD FOR IT TEN OR ELEVEN WIVES IS ALL YOU NEED NEVER GO OVER IT
SOME INSTINCT OR OTHER MADE ME SET THIS JOHNSON DOWN AS BEING UNRELIABLE
AND YET HE WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING PERSON AND I DOUBT IF SOME OF THE
INFORMATION HE GAVE US COULD HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE
HE WAS A PLEASANT CONTRAST TO THOSE RETICENT MORMONS
CHAPTER XVI
ALL MEN HAVE HEARD OF THE MORMON BIBLE BUT FEW EXCEPT THE ELECT HAVE
SEEN IT OR AT LEAST TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO READ IT
I BROUGHT AWAY A
COPY FROM SALT LAKE
THE BOOK IS A CURIOSITY TO ME IT IS SUCH A
PRETENTIOUS AFFAIR AND YET SO SLOW SO SLEEPY SUCH AN INSIPID MESS OF
INSPIRATION
IT IS CHLOROFORM IN PRINT
IF JOSEPH SMITH COMPOSED THIS
BOOK THE ACT WAS A MIRACLE KEEPING AWAKE WHILE HE DID IT WAS AT ANY
RATE
IF HE ACCORDING TO TRADITION MERELY TRANSLATED IT FROM CERTAIN
ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUSLY ENGRAVED PLATES OF COPPER WHICH HE DECLARES HE
FOUND UNDER A STONE IN AN OUT OF THE WAY LOCALITY THE WORK OF
TRANSLATING WAS EQUALLY A MIRACLE FOR THE SAME REASON
THE BOOK SEEMS TO BE MERELY A PROSY DETAIL OF IMAGINARY HISTORY WITH THE
OLD TESTAMENT FOR A MODEL FOLLOWED BY A TEDIOUS PLAGIARISM OF THE NEW
TESTAMENT
THE AUTHOR LABORED TO GIVE HIS WORDS AND PHRASES THE QUAINT
OLD FASHIONED SOUND AND STRUCTURE OF OUR KING JAMES'S TRANSLATION OF THE
SCRIPTURES AND THE RESULT IS A MONGREL HALF MODERN GLIBNESS AND HALF
ANCIENT SIMPLICITY AND GRAVITY
THE LATTER IS AWKWARD AND CONSTRAINED
THE FORMER NATURAL BUT GROTESQUE BY THE CONTRAST
WHENEVER HE FOUND HIS
SPEECH GROWING TOO MODERN WHICH WAS ABOUT EVERY SENTENCE OR TWO HE
LADLED IN A FEW SUCH SCRIPTURAL PHRASES AS EXCEEDING SORE AND IT CAME
TO PASS ETC AND MADE THINGS SATISFACTORY AGAIN
AND IT CAME TO
PASS WAS HIS PET
IF HE HAD LEFT THAT OUT HIS BIBLE WOULD HAVE BEEN
ONLY A PAMPHLET
THE TITLE PAGE READS AS FOLLOWS
THE BOOK OF MORMON AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON UPON
PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI
WHEREFORE IT IS AN ABRIDGMENT OF THE RECORD OF THE PEOPLE OF NEPHI
AND ALSO OF THE LAMANITES WRITTEN TO THE LAMANITES WHO ARE A
REMNANT OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND ALSO TO JEW AND GENTILE WRITTEN
BY WAY OF COMMANDMENT AND ALSO BY THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY AND OF
REVELATION
WRITTEN AND SEALED UP AND HID UP UNTO THE LORD THAT
THEY MIGHT NOT BE DESTROYED TO COME FORTH BY THE GIFT AND POWER OF
GOD UNTO THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF SEALED BY THE HAND OF MORONI
AND HID UP UNTO THE LORD TO COME FORTH IN DUE TIME BY THE WAY OF
GENTILE THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF BY THE GIFT OF GOD
AN
ABRIDGMENT TAKEN FROM THE BOOK OF ETHER ALSO WHICH IS A RECORD OF
THE PEOPLE OF JARED WHO WERE SCATTERED AT THE TIME THE LORD
CONFOUNDED THE LANGUAGE OF THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE BUILDING A
TOWER TO GET TO HEAVEN
HID UP IS GOOD
AND SO IS WHEREFORE THOUGH WHY WHEREFORE ANY
OTHER WORD WOULD HAVE ANSWERED AS WELL THOUGH IN TRUTH IT WOULD NOT
HAVE SOUNDED SO SCRIPTURAL
NEXT COMES
THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES
BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL NATIONS KINDREDS TONGUES AND PEOPLE UNTO
WHOM THIS WORK SHALL COME THAT WE THROUGH THE GRACE OF GOD THE
FATHER AND OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST HAVE SEEN THE PLATES WHICH
CONTAIN THIS RECORD WHICH IS A RECORD OF THE PEOPLE OF NEPHI AND
ALSO OF THE LAMANITES THEIR BRETHREN AND ALSO OF THE PEOPLE OF
JARED WHO CAME FROM THE TOWER OF WHICH HATH BEEN SPOKEN AND WE
ALSO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED BY THE GIFT AND POWER OF
GOD FOR HIS VOICE HATH DECLARED IT UNTO US WHEREFORE WE KNOW OF A
SURETY THAT THE WORK IS TRUE
AND WE ALSO TESTIFY THAT WE HAVE SEEN
THE ENGRAVINGS WHICH ARE UPON THE PLATES AND THEY HAVE BEEN SHOWN
UNTO US BY THE POWER OF GOD AND NOT OF MAN
AND WE DECLARE WITH
WORDS OF SOBERNESS THAT AN ANGEL OF GOD CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN AND
HE BROUGHT AND LAID BEFORE OUR EYES THAT WE BEHELD AND SAW THE
PLATES AND THE ENGRAVINGS THEREON AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS BY THE
GRACE OF GOD THE FATHER AND OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST THAT WE BEHELD
AND BEAR RECORD THAT THESE THINGS ARE TRUE AND IT IS MARVELLOUS IN
OUR EYES NEVERTHELESS THE VOICE OF THE LORD COMMANDED US THAT WE
SHOULD BEAR RECORD OF IT WHEREFORE TO BE OBEDIENT UNTO THE
COMMANDMENTS OF GOD WE BEAR TESTIMONY OF THESE THINGS
AND WE KNOW
THAT IF WE ARE FAITHFUL IN CHRIST WE SHALL RID OUR GARMENTS OF THE
BLOOD OF ALL MEN AND BE FOUND SPOTLESS BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF
CHRIST AND SHALL DWELL WITH HIM ETERNALLY IN THE HEAVENS
AND THE
HONOR BE TO THE FATHER AND TO THE SON AND TO THE HOLY GHOST WHICH
IS ONE GOD
AMEN

SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE A WORLD OF EVIDENCE BEFORE THEY CAN COME
ANYWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BELIEVING ANYTHING BUT FOR ME WHEN A
MAN TELLS ME THAT HE HAS SEEN THE ENGRAVINGS WHICH ARE UPON THE PLATES
AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT AN ANGEL WAS THERE AT THE TIME AND SAW HIM SEE
THEM AND PROBABLY TOOK HIS RECEIPT FOR IT I AM VERY FAR ON THE ROAD TO
CONVICTION NO MATTER WHETHER I EVER HEARD OF THAT MAN BEFORE OR NOT AND
EVEN IF I DO NOT KNOW THE NAME OF THE ANGEL OR HIS NATIONALITY EITHER
NEXT IS THIS
AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES
BE IT KNOWN UNTO ALL NATIONS KINDREDS TONGUES AND PEOPLE UNTO
WHOM THIS WORK SHALL COME THAT JOSEPH SMITH JR THE TRANSLATOR OF
THIS WORK HAS SHOWN UNTO US THE PLATES OF WHICH HATH BEEN SPOKEN
WHICH HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF GOLD AND AS MANY OF THE LEAVES AS THE
SAID SMITH HAS TRANSLATED WE DID HANDLE WITH OUR HANDS AND WE ALSO
SAW THE ENGRAVINGS THEREON ALL OF WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF
ANCIENT WORK AND OF CURIOUS WORKMANSHIP
AND THIS WE BEAR RECORD
WITH WORDS OF SOBERNESS THAT THE SAID SMITH HAS SHOWN UNTO US FOR
WE HAVE SEEN AND HEFTED AND KNOW OF A SURETY THAT THE SAID SMITH
HAS GOT THE PLATES OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
AND WE GIVE OUR NAMES
UNTO THE WORLD TO WITNESS UNTO THE WORLD THAT WHICH WE HAVE SEEN
AND WE LIE NOT GOD BEARING WITNESS OF IT

AND WHEN I AM FAR ON THE ROAD TO CONVICTION AND EIGHT MEN BE THEY
GRAMMATICAL OR OTHERWISE COME FORWARD AND TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE SEEN
THE PLATES TOO AND NOT ONLY SEEN THOSE PLATES BUT HEFTED THEM I AM
CONVINCED
I COULD NOT FEEL MORE SATISFIED AND AT REST IF THE ENTIRE
WHITMER FAMILY HAD TESTIFIED
THE MORMON BIBLE CONSISTS OF FIFTEEN BOOKS BEING THE BOOKS OF JACOB
ENOS JAROM OMNI MOSIAH ZENIFF ALMA HELAMAN ETHER MORONI TWO
BOOKS OF MORMON AND THREE OF NEPHI
IN THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI IS A PLAGIARISM OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WHICH
GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THE EXODUS FROM JERUSALEM OF THE CHILDREN OF LEHI
AND IT GOES ON TO TELL OF THEIR WANDERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS DURING
EIGHT YEARS AND THEIR SUPERNATURAL PROTECTION BY ONE OF THEIR NUMBER A
PARTY BY THE NAME OF NEPHI
THEY FINALLY REACHED THE LAND OF
BOUNTIFUL AND CAMPED BY THE SEA
AFTER THEY HAD REMAINED THERE FOR
THE SPACE OF MANY DAYS WHICH IS MORE SCRIPTURAL THAN DEFINITE NEPHI
WAS COMMANDED FROM ON HIGH TO BUILD A SHIP WHEREIN TO CARRY THE PEOPLE
ACROSS THE WATERS HE TRAVESTIED NOAH'S ARK BUT HE OBEYED ORDERS IN
THE MATTER OF THE PLAN
HE FINISHED THE SHIP IN A SINGLE DAY WHILE HIS
BRETHREN STOOD BY AND MADE FUN OF IT AND OF HIM TOO SAYING OUR
BROTHER IS A FOOL FOR HE THINKETH THAT HE CAN BUILD A SHIP THEY DID
NOT WAIT FOR THE TIMBERS TO DRY BUT THE WHOLE TRIBE OR NATION SAILED THE
NEXT DAY
THEN A BIT OF GENUINE NATURE CROPPED OUT AND IS REVEALED BY
OUTSPOKEN NEPHI WITH SCRIPTURAL FRANKNESS THEY ALL GOT ON A SPREE
THEY AND ALSO THEIR WIVES BEGAN TO MAKE THEMSELVES MERRY INSOMUCH
THAT THEY BEGAN TO DANCE AND TO SING AND TO SPEAK WITH MUCH RUDENESS
YEA THEY WERE LIFTED UP UNTO EXCEEDING RUDENESS
NEPHI TRIED TO STOP THESE SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS BUT THEY TIED HIM NECK
AND HEELS AND WENT ON WITH THEIR LARK
BUT OBSERVE HOW NEPHI THE
PROPHET CIRCUMVENTED THEM BY THE AID OF THE INVISIBLE POWERS
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT AFTER THEY HAD BOUND ME INSOMUCH THAT I
COULD NOT MOVE THE COMPASS WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED OF THE LORD
DID CEASE TO WORK WHEREFORE THEY KNEW NOT WHITHER THEY SHOULD
STEER THE SHIP INSOMUCH THAT THERE AROSE A GREAT STORM YEA A
GREAT AND TERRIBLE TEMPEST AND WE WERE DRIVEN BACK UPON THE WATERS
FOR THE SPACE OF THREE DAYS AND THEY BEGAN TO BE FRIGHTENED
EXCEEDINGLY LEST THEY SHOULD BE DROWNED IN THE SEA NEVERTHELESS
THEY DID NOT LOOSE ME
AND ON THE FOURTH DAY WHICH WE HAD BEEN
DRIVEN BACK THE TEMPEST BEGAN TO BE EXCEEDING SORE
AND IT CAME TO
PASS THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA
THEN THEY UNTIED HIM
AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THEY HAD LOOSED ME BEHOLD I TOOK THE
COMPASS AND IT DID WORK WHITHER I DESIRED IT
AND IT CAME TO PASS
THAT I PRAYED UNTO THE LORD AND AFTER I HAD PRAYED THE WINDS DID
CEASE AND THE STORM DID CEASE AND THERE WAS A GREAT CALM
EQUIPPED WITH THEIR COMPASS THESE ANCIENTS APPEAR TO HAVE HAD THE
ADVANTAGE OF NOAH
THEIR VOYAGE WAS TOWARD A PROMISED LAND THE ONLY NAME THEY GIVE IT
THEY REACHED IT IN SAFETY
POLYGAMY IS A RECENT FEATURE IN THE MORMON RELIGION AND WAS ADDED BY
BRIGHAM YOUNG AFTER JOSEPH SMITH'S DEATH
BEFORE THAT IT WAS REGARDED
AS AN ABOMINATION THIS VERSE FROM THE MORMON BIBLE OCCURS IN CHAPTER
II
OF THE BOOK OF JACOB
FOR BEHOLD THUS SAITH THE LORD THIS PEOPLE BEGIN TO WAX IN
INIQUITY THEY UNDERSTAND NOT THE SCRIPTURES FOR THEY SEEK TO
EXCUSE THEMSELVES IN COMMITTING WHOREDOMS BECAUSE OF THE THINGS
WHICH WERE WRITTEN CONCERNING DAVID AND SOLOMON HIS SON
BEHOLD
DAVID AND SOLOMON TRULY HAD MANY WIVES AND CONCUBINES WHICH THING
WAS ABOMINABLE BEFORE ME SAITH THE LORD WHEREFORE THUS SAITH THE
LORD I HAVE LED THIS PEOPLE FORTH OUT OF THE LAND OF JERUSALEM BY
THE POWER OF MINE ARM THAT I MIGHT RAISE UP UNTO ME A RIGHTEOUS
BRANCH FROM THE FRUIT OF THE LOINS OF JOSEPH
WHEREFORE I THE LORD
GOD WILL NO SUFFER THAT THIS PEOPLE SHALL DO LIKE UNTO THEM OF OLD
HOWEVER THE PROJECT FAILED OR AT LEAST THE MODERN MORMON END OF IT FOR
BRIGHAM SUFFERS IT
THIS VERSE IS FROM THE SAME CHAPTER
BEHOLD THE LAMANITES YOUR BRETHREN WHOM YE HATE BECAUSE OF THEIR
FILTHINESS AND THE CURSINGS WHICH HATH COME UPON THEIR SKINS ARE
MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN YOU FOR THEY HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE COMMANDMENT
OF THE LORD WHICH WAS GIVEN UNTO OUR FATHERS THAT THEY SHOULD
HAVE SAVE IT WERE ONE WIFE AND CONCUBINES THEY SHOULD HAVE NONE
THE FOLLOWING VERSE FROM CHAPTER IX
OF THE BOOK OF NEPHI APPEARS TO
CONTAIN INFORMATION NOT FAMILIAR TO EVERYBODY
AND NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN JESUS HAD ASCENDED INTO HEAVEN
THE MULTITUDE DID DISPERSE AND EVERY MAN DID TAKE HIS WIFE AND HIS
CHILDREN AND DID RETURN TO HIS OWN HOME
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE MORROW WHEN THE MULTITUDE WAS
GATHERED TOGETHER BEHOLD NEPHI AND HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HAD RAISED
FROM THE DEAD WHOSE NAME WAS TIMOTHY AND ALSO HIS SON WHOSE NAME
WAS JONAS AND ALSO MATHONI AND MATHONIHAH HIS BROTHER AND KUMEN
AND KUMENENHI AND JEREMIAH AND SHEMNON AND JONAS AND ZEDEKIAH
AND ISAIAH NOW THESE WERE THE NAMES OF THE DISCIPLES WHOM JESUS HAD
CHOSEN
IN ORDER THAT THE READER MAY OBSERVE HOW MUCH MORE GRANDEUR AND
PICTURESQUENESS AS SEEN BY THESE MORMON TWELVE ACCOMPANIED ON OF THE
TENDEREST EPISODES IN THE LIFE OF OUR SAVIOUR THAN OTHER EYES SEEM TO
HAVE BEEN AWARE OF I QUOTE THE FOLLOWING FROM THE SAME BOOK NEPHI
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT JESUS SPAKE UNTO THEM AND BADE THEM ARISE
AND THEY AROSE FROM THE EARTH AND HE SAID UNTO THEM BLESSED ARE YE
BECAUSE OF YOUR FAITH
AND NOW BEHOLD MY JOY IS FULL
AND WHEN HE
HAD SAID THESE WORDS HE WEPT AND THE MULTITUDE BEAR RECORD OF IT
AND HE TOOK THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN ONE BY ONE AND BLESSED THEM AND
PRAYED UNTO THE FATHER FOR THEM
AND WHEN HE HAD DONE THIS HE WEPT
AGAIN AND HE SPAKE UNTO THE MULTITUDE AND SAITH UNTO THEM BEHOLD
YOUR LITTLE ONES
AND AS THEY LOOKED TO BEHOLD THEY CAST THEIR
EYES TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEY SAW THE HEAVENS OPEN AND THEY SAW
ANGELS DESCENDING OUT OF HEAVEN AS IT WERE IN THE MIDST OF FIRE
AND THEY CAME DOWN AND ENCIRCLED THOSE LITTLE ONES ABOUT AND THEY
WERE ENCIRCLED ABOUT WITH FIRE AND THE ANGELS DID MINISTER UNTO
THEM AND THE MULTITUDE DID SEE AND HEAR AND BEAR RECORD AND THEY
KNOW THAT THEIR RECORD IS TRUE FOR THEY ALL OF THEM DID SEE AND
HEAR EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF AND THEY WERE IN NUMBER ABOUT TWO
THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED SOULS AND THEY DID CONSIST OF MEN WOMEN
AND CHILDREN
AND WHAT ELSE WOULD THEY BE LIKELY TO CONSIST OF
THE BOOK OF ETHER IS AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE MEDLEY OF IF HISTORY MUCH OF
IT RELATING TO BATTLES AND SIEGES AMONG PEOPLES WHOM THE READER HAS
POSSIBLY NEVER HEARD OF AND WHO INHABITED A COUNTRY WHICH IS NOT SET
DOWN IN THE GEOGRAPHY
THESE WAS A KING WITH THE REMARKABLE NAME OF
CORIANTUMR AND HE WARRED WITH SHARED AND LIB AND SHIZ AND OTHERS
IN THE PLAINS OF HESHLON AND THE VALLEY OF GILGAL AND THE
WILDERNESS OF AKISH AND THE LAND OF MORAN AND THE PLAINS OF
AGOSH AND OGATH AND RAMAH AND THE LAND OF CORIHOR AND THE
HILL COMNOR BY THE WATERS OF RIPLIANCUM ETC ETC ETC
AND IT
CAME TO PASS AFTER A DEAL OF FIGHTING THAT CORIANTUMR UPON MAKING
CALCULATION OF HIS LOSSES FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN SLAIN TWO MILLIONS
OF MIGHTY MEN AND ALSO THEIR WIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN SAY 5 000 000 OR
6 000 000 IN ALL AND HE BEGAN TO SORROW IN HIS HEART UNQUESTIONABLY
IT WAS TIME
SO HE WROTE TO SHIZ ASKING A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND
OFFERING TO GIVE UP HIS KINGDOM TO SAVE HIS PEOPLE
SHIZ DECLINED
EXCEPT UPON CONDITION THAT CORIANTUMR WOULD COME AND LET HIM CUT HIS HEAD
OFF FIRST A THING WHICH CORIANTUMR WOULD NOT DO
THEN THERE WAS MORE
FIGHTING FOR A SEASON THEN FOUR YEARS WERE DEVOTED TO GATHERING THE
FORCES FOR A FINAL STRUGGLE AFTER WHICH ENSUED A BATTLE WHICH I TAKE
IT IS THE MOST REMARKABLE SET FORTH IN HISTORY EXCEPT PERHAPS THAT
OF THE KILKENNY CATS WHICH IT RESEMBLES IN SOME RESPECTS
THIS IS THE
ACCOUNT OF THE GATHERING AND THE BATTLE
7
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT THEY DID GATHER TOGETHER ALL THE
PEOPLE UPON ALL THE FACE OF THE LAND WHO HAD NOT BEEN SLAIN SAVE
IT WAS ETHER
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ETHER DID BEHOLD ALL THE
DOINGS OF THE PEOPLE AND HE BEHELD THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FOR
CORIANTUMR WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO THE ARMY OF CORIANTUMR AND
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FOR SHIZ WERE GATHERED TOGETHER TO THE ARMY OF
SHIZ WHEREFORE THEY WERE FOR THE SPACE OF FOUR YEARS GATHERING
TOGETHER THE PEOPLE THAT THEY MIGHT GET ALL WHO WERE UPON THE FACE
OF THE LAND AND THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE ALL THE STRENGTH WHICH IT
WAS POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD RECEIVE
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN
THEY WERE ALL GATHERED TOGETHER EVERY ONE TO THE ARMY WHICH HE
WOULD WITH THEIR WIVES AND THEIR CHILDREN BOTH MEN WOMEN AND
CHILDREN BEING ARMED WITH WEAPONS OF WAR HAVING SHIELDS AND
BREAST PLATES AND HEAD PLATES AND BEING CLOTHED AFTER THE MANNER
OF WAR THEY DID MARCH FORTH ONE AGAINST ANOTHER TO BATTLE AND
THEY FOUGHT ALL THAT DAY AND CONQUERED NOT
AND IT CAME TO PASS
THAT WHEN IT WAS NIGHT THEY WERE WEARY AND RETIRED TO THEIR CAMPS
AND AFTER THEY HAD RETIRED TO THEIR CAMPS THEY TOOK UP A HOWLING
AND A LAMENTATION FOR THE LOSS OF THE SLAIN OF THEIR PEOPLE AND SO
GREAT WERE THEIR CRIES THEIR HOWLINGS AND LAMENTATIONS THAT IT DID
REND THE AIR EXCEEDINGLY
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE MORROW
THEY DID GO AGAIN TO BATTLE AND GREAT AND TERRIBLE WAS THAT DAY
NEVERTHELESS THEY CONQUERED NOT AND WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AGAIN THEY
DID REND THE AIR WITH THEIR CRIES AND THEIR HOWLINGS AND THEIR
MOURNINGS FOR THE LOSS OF THE SLAIN OF THEIR PEOPLE
8
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT CORIANTUMR WROTE AGAIN AN EPISTLE UNTO
SHIZ DESIRING THAT HE WOULD NOT COME AGAIN TO BATTLE BUT THAT HE
WOULD TAKE THE KINGDOM AND SPARE THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE
BUT
BEHOLD THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD HAD CEASED STRIVING WITH THEM AND
SATAN HAD FULL POWER OVER THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE FOR THEY WERE
GIVEN UP UNTO THE HARDNESS OF THEIR HEARTS AND THE BLINDNESS OF
THEIR MINDS THAT THEY MIGHT BE DESTROYED WHEREFORE THEY WENT AGAIN
TO BATTLE
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT THEY FOUGHT ALL THAT DAY AND
WHEN THE NIGHT CAME THEY SLEPT UPON THEIR SWORDS AND ON THE MORROW
THEY FOUGHT EVEN UNTIL THE NIGHT CAME AND WHEN THE NIGHT CAME THEY
WERE DRUNKEN WITH ANGER EVEN AS A MAN WHO IS DRUNKEN WITH WINE AND
THEY SLEPT AGAIN UPON THEIR SWORDS AND ON THE MORROW THEY FOUGHT
AGAIN AND WHEN THE NIGHT CAME THEY HAD ALL FALLEN BY THE SWORD SAVE
IT WERE FIFTY AND TWO OF THE PEOPLE OF CORIANTUMR AND SIXTY AND
NINE OF THE PEOPLE OF SHIZ
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT THEY SLEPT
UPON THEIR SWORDS THAT NIGHT AND ON THE MORROW THEY FOUGHT AGAIN
AND THEY CONTENDED IN THEIR MIGHTS WITH THEIR SWORDS AND WITH THEIR
SHIELDS ALL THAT DAY AND WHEN THE NIGHT CAME THERE WERE THIRTY AND
TWO OF THE PEOPLE OF SHIZ AND TWENTY AND SEVEN OF THE PEOPLE OF
CORIANTUMR
9
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT THEY ATE AND SLEPT AND PREPARED FOR
DEATH ON THE MORROW
AND THEY WERE LARGE AND MIGHTY MEN AS TO THE
STRENGTH OF MEN
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT THEY FOUGHT FOR THE SPACE
OF THREE HOURS AND THEY FAINTED WITH THE LOSS OF BLOOD
AND IT
CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN THE MEN OF CORIANTUMR HAD RECEIVED SUFFICIENT
STRENGTH THAT THEY COULD WALK THEY WERE ABOUT TO FLEE FOR THEIR
LIVES BUT BEHOLD SHIZ AROSE AND ALSO HIS MEN AND HE SWORE IN HIS
WRATH THAT HE WOULD SLAY CORIANTUMR OR HE WOULD PERISH BY THE
SWORD WHEREFORE HE DID PURSUE THEM AND ON THE MORROW HE DID
OVERTAKE THEM AND THEY FOUGHT AGAIN WITH THE SWORD
AND IT CAME TO
PASS THAT WHEN THEY HAD ALL FALLEN BY THE SWORD SAVE IT WERE
CORIANTUMR AND SHIZ BEHOLD SHIZ HAD FAINTED WITH LOSS OF BLOOD
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN CORIANTUMR HAD LEANED UPON HIS SWORD
THAT HE RESTED A LITTLE HE SMOTE OFF THE HEAD OF SHIZ
AND IT CAME
TO PASS THAT AFTER HE HAD SMOTE OFF THE HEAD OF SHIZ THAT SHIZ
RAISED UPON HIS HANDS AND FELL AND AFTER THAT HE HAD STRUGGLED FOR
BREATH HE DIED
AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT CORIANTUMR FELL TO THE
EARTH AND BECAME AS IF HE HAD NO LIFE
AND THE LORD SPAKE UNTO
ETHER AND SAID UNTO HIM GO FORTH
AND HE WENT FORTH AND BEHELD
THAT THE WORDS OF THE LORD HAD ALL BEEN FULFILLED AND HE FINISHED
HIS RECORD AND THE HUNDREDTH PART I HAVE NOT WRITTEN
IT SEEMS A PITY HE DID NOT FINISH FOR AFTER ALL HIS DREARY FORMER
CHAPTERS OF COMMONPLACE HE STOPPED JUST AS HE WAS IN DANGER OF BECOMING
INTERESTING
THE MORMON BIBLE IS RATHER STUPID AND TIRESOME TO READ BUT THERE IS
NOTHING VICIOUS IN ITS TEACHINGS
ITS CODE OF MORALS IS UNOBJECTIONABLE
IT IS SMOUCHED MILTON FROM THE NEW TESTAMENT AND NO CREDIT GIVEN
CHAPTER XVII
AT THE END OF OUR TWO DAYS' SOJOURN WE LEFT GREAT SALT LAKE CITY HEARTY
AND WELL FED AND HAPPY PHYSICALLY SUPERB BUT NOT SO VERY MUCH WISER AS
REGARDS THE MORMON QUESTION THAN WE WERE WHEN WE ARRIVED PERHAPS
WE HAD A DEAL MORE INFORMATION THAN WE HAD BEFORE OF COURSE BUT WE
DID NOT KNOW WHAT PORTION OF IT WAS RELIABLE AND WHAT WAS NOT FOR IT ALL
CAME FROM ACQUAINTANCES OF A DAY STRANGERS STRICTLY SPEAKING
WE WERE
TOLD FOR INSTANCE THAT THE DREADFUL MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE WAS THE
WORK OF THE INDIANS ENTIRELY AND THAT THE GENTILES HAD MEANLY TRIED TO
FASTEN IT UPON THE MORMONS WE WERE TOLD LIKEWISE THAT THE INDIANS WERE
TO BLAME PARTLY AND PARTLY THE MORMONS AND WE WERE TOLD LIKEWISE AND
JUST AS POSITIVELY THAT THE MORMONS WERE ALMOST IF NOT WHOLLY AND
COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MOST TREACHEROUS AND PITILESS BUTCHERY
WE GOT THE STORY IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT SHAPES BUT IT WAS NOT TILL
SEVERAL YEARS AFTERWARD THAT MRS
WAITE'S BOOK THE MORMON PROPHET
CAME OUT WITH JUDGE CRADLEBAUGH'S TRIAL OF THE ACCUSED PARTIES IN IT AND
REVEALED THE TRUTH THAT THE LATTER VERSION WAS THE CORRECT ONE AND THAT
THE MORMONS WERE THE ASSASSINS
ALL OUR INFORMATION HAD THREE SIDES TO
IT AND SO I GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT I COULD SETTLE THE MORMON QUESTION
IN TWO DAYS
STILL I HAVE SEEN NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS DO IT IN ONE
I LEFT GREAT SALT LAKE A GOOD DEAL CONFUSED AS TO WHAT STATE OF THINGS
EXISTED THERE AND SOMETIMES EVEN QUESTIONING IN MY OWN MIND WHETHER A
STATE OF THINGS EXISTED THERE AT ALL OR NOT
BUT PRESENTLY I REMEMBERED
WITH A LIGHTENING SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE HAD LEARNED TWO OR THREE
TRIVIAL THINGS THERE WHICH WE COULD BE CERTAIN OF AND SO THE TWO DAYS
WERE NOT WHOLLY LOST
FOR INSTANCE WE HAD LEARNED THAT WE WERE AT LAST
IN A PIONEER LAND IN ABSOLUTE AND TANGIBLE REALITY
THE HIGH PRICES CHARGED FOR TRIFLES WERE ELOQUENT OF HIGH FREIGHTS AND
BEWILDERING DISTANCES OF FREIGHTAGE
IN THE EAST IN THOSE DAYS THE
SMALLEST MONEYED DENOMINATION WAS A PENNY AND IT REPRESENTED THE SMALLEST
PURCHASABLE QUANTITY OF ANY COMMODITY
WEST OF CINCINNATI THE SMALLEST
COIN IN USE WAS THE SILVER FIVE CENT PIECE AND NO SMALLER QUANTITY OF AN
ARTICLE COULD BE BOUGHT THAN FIVE CENTS' WORTH IN OVERLAND CITY THE
LOWEST COIN APPEARED TO BE THE TEN CENT PIECE BUT IN SALT LAKE THERE DID
NOT SEEM TO BE ANY MONEY IN CIRCULATION SMALLER THAN A QUARTER OR ANY
SMALLER QUANTITY PURCHASABLE OF ANY COMMODITY THAN TWENTY FIVE CENTS'
WORTH
WE HAD ALWAYS BEEN USED TO HALF DIMES AND FIVE CENTS' WORTH AS
THE MINIMUM OF FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONS BUT IN SALT LAKE IF ONE WANTED A
CIGAR IT WAS A QUARTER IF HE WANTED A CHALK PIPE IT WAS A QUARTER IF
HE WANTED A PEACH OR A CANDLE OR A NEWSPAPER OR A SHAVE OR A LITTLE
GENTILE WHISKEY TO RUB ON HIS CORNS TO ARREST INDIGESTION AND KEEP HIM
FROM HAVING THE TOOTHACHE TWENTY FIVE CENTS WAS THE PRICE EVERY TIME
WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE SHOT BAG OF SILVER NOW AND THEN WE SEEMED TO BE
WASTING OUR SUBSTANCE IN RIOTOUS LIVING BUT IF WE REFERRED TO THE
EXPENSE ACCOUNT WE COULD SEE THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN DOING ANYTHING OF THE
KIND
BUT PEOPLE EASILY GET RECONCILED TO BIG MONEY AND BIG PRICES AND FOND
AND VAIN OF BOTH IT IS A DESCENT TO LITTLE COINS AND CHEAP PRICES THAT
IS HARDEST TO BEAR AND SLOWEST TO TAKE HOLD UPON ONE'S TOLERATION
AFTER
A MONTH'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE TWENTY FIVE CENT MINIMUM THE AVERAGE
HUMAN BEING IS READY TO BLUSH EVERY TIME HE THINKS OF HIS DESPICABLE
FIVE CENT DAYS
HOW SUNBURNT WITH BLUSHES I USED TO GET IN GAUDY NEVADA
EVERY TIME I THOUGHT OF MY FIRST FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE IN SALT LAKE
IT WAS ON THIS WISE WHICH IS A FAVORITE EXPRESSION OF GREAT AUTHORS AND
A VERY NEAT ONE TOO BUT I NEVER HEAR ANYBODY SAY ON THIS WISE WHEN THEY
ARE TALKING
A YOUNG HALF BREED WITH A COMPLEXION LIKE A YELLOW JACKET
ASKED ME IF I WOULD HAVE MY BOOTS BLACKED
IT WAS AT THE SALT LAKE HOUSE
THE MORNING AFTER WE ARRIVED
I SAID YES AND HE BLACKED THEM
THEN I
HANDED HIM A SILVER FIVE CENT PIECE WITH THE BENEVOLENT AIR OF A PERSON
WHO IS CONFERRING WEALTH AND BLESSEDNESS UPON POVERTY AND SUFFERING
THE
YELLOW JACKET TOOK IT WITH WHAT I JUDGED TO BE SUPPRESSED EMOTION AND
LAID IT REVERENTLY DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BROAD HAND
THEN HE BEGAN
TO CONTEMPLATE IT MUCH AS A PHILOSOPHER CONTEMPLATES A GNAT'S EAR IN THE
AMPLE FIELD OF HIS MICROSCOPE
SEVERAL MOUNTAINEERS TEAMSTERS
STAGE DRIVERS ETC DREW NEAR AND DROPPED INTO THE TABLEAU AND FELL TO
SURVEYING THE MONEY WITH THAT ATTRACTIVE INDIFFERENCE TO FORMALITY WHICH
IS NOTICEABLE IN THE HARDY PIONEER
PRESENTLY THE YELLOW JACKET HANDED
THE HALF DIME BACK TO ME AND TOLD ME I OUGHT TO KEEP MY MONEY IN MY
POCKET BOOK INSTEAD OF IN MY SOUL AND THEN I WOULDN'T GET IT CRAMPED AND
SHRIVELED UP SO
WHAT A ROAR OF VULGAR LAUGHTER THERE WAS I DESTROYED THE MONGREL
REPTILE ON THE SPOT BUT I SMILED AND SMILED ALL THE TIME I WAS DETACHING
HIS SCALP FOR THE REMARK HE MADE WAS GOOD FOR AN INJUN
YES WE HAD LEARNED IN SALT LAKE TO BE CHARGED GREAT PRICES WITHOUT
LETTING THE INWARD SHUDDER APPEAR ON THE SURFACE FOR EVEN ALREADY WE HAD
OVERHEARD AND NOTED THE TENOR OF CONVERSATIONS AMONG DRIVERS CONDUCTORS
AND HOSTLERS AND FINALLY AMONG CITIZENS OF SALT LAKE UNTIL WE WERE WELL
AWARE THAT THESE SUPERIOR BEINGS DESPISED EMIGRANTS WE PERMITTED NO
TELL TALE SHUDDERS AND WINCES IN OUR COUNTENANCES FOR WE WANTED TO SEEM
PIONEERS OR MORMONS HALF BREEDS TEAMSTERS STAGE DRIVERS MOUNTAIN
MEADOW ASSASSINS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD THAT THE PLAINS AND UTAH
RESPECTED AND ADMIRED BUT WE WERE WRETCHEDLY ASHAMED OF BEING
EMIGRANTS AND SORRY ENOUGH THAT WE HAD WHITE SHIRTS AND COULD NOT
SWEAR IN THE PRESENCE OF LADIES WITHOUT LOOKING THE OTHER WAY
AND MANY A TIME IN NEVADA AFTERWARDS WE HAD OCCASION TO REMEMBER WITH
HUMILIATION THAT WE WERE EMIGRANTS AND CONSEQUENTLY A LOW AND INFERIOR
SORT OF CREATURES
PERHAPS THE READER HAS VISITED UTAH NEVADA OR
CALIFORNIA EVEN IN THESE LATTER DAYS AND WHILE COMMUNING WITH HIMSELF
UPON THE SORROWFUL BANISHMENT OF THESE COUNTRIES FROM WHAT HE CONSIDERS
THE WORLD HAS HAD HIS WINGS CLIPPED BY FINDING THAT HE IS THE ONE TO
BE PITIED AND THAT THERE ARE ENTIRE POPULATIONS AROUND HIM READY AND
WILLING TO DO IT FOR HIM YEA WHO ARE COMPLACENTLY DOING IT FOR HIM
ALREADY WHEREVER HE STEPS HIS FOOT
POOR THING THEY ARE MAKING FUN OF HIS HAT AND THE CUT OF HIS NEW YORK
COAT AND HIS CONSCIENTIOUSNESS ABOUT HIS GRAMMAR AND HIS FEEBLE
PROFANITY AND HIS CONSUMINGLY LUDICROUS IGNORANCE OF ORES SHAFTS
TUNNELS AND OTHER THINGS WHICH HE NEVER SAW BEFORE AND NEVER FELT
ENOUGH INTEREST IN TO READ ABOUT
AND ALL THE TIME THAT HE IS THINKING
WHAT A SAD FATE IT IS TO BE EXILED TO THAT FAR COUNTRY THAT LONELY LAND
THE CITIZENS AROUND HIM ARE LOOKING DOWN ON HIM WITH A BLIGHTING
COMPASSION BECAUSE HE IS AN EMIGRANT INSTEAD OF THAT PROUDEST AND
BLESSEDEST CREATURE THAT EXISTS ON ALL THE EARTH A FORTY NINER
THE ACCUSTOMED COACH LIFE BEGAN AGAIN NOW AND BY MIDNIGHT IT ALMOST
SEEMED AS IF WE NEVER HAD BEEN OUT OF OUR SNUGGERY AMONG THE MAIL SACKS
AT ALL
WE HAD MADE ONE ALTERATION HOWEVER
WE HAD PROVIDED ENOUGH
BREAD BOILED HAM AND HARD BOILED EGGS TO LAST DOUBLE THE SIX HUNDRED
MILES OF STAGING WE HAD STILL TO DO
AND IT WAS COMFORT IN THOSE SUCCEEDING DAYS TO SIT UP AND CONTEMPLATE THE
MAJESTIC PANORAMA OF MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS SPREAD OUT BELOW US AND EAT
HAM AND HARD BOILED EGGS WHILE OUR SPIRITUAL NATURES REVELLED ALTERNATELY
IN RAINBOWS THUNDERSTORMS AND PEERLESS SUNSETS
NOTHING HELPS SCENERY
LIKE HAM AND EGGS
HAM AND EGGS AND AFTER THESE A PIPE AN OLD RANK
DELICIOUS PIPE HAM AND EGGS AND SCENERY A DOWN GRADE A FLYING COACH
A FRAGRANT PIPE AND A CONTENTED HEART THESE MAKE HAPPINESS
IT IS WHAT
ALL THE AGES HAVE STRUGGLED FOR
CHAPTER XVIII
AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING WE REACHED THE REMNANT AND RUIN OF WHAT HAD BEEN
THE IMPORTANT MILITARY STATION OF CAMP FLOYD SOME FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY
MILES FROM SALT LAKE CITY
AT FOUR P M
WE HAD DOUBLED OUR DISTANCE AND
WERE NINETY OR A HUNDRED MILES FROM SALT LAKE
AND NOW WE ENTERED UPON
ONE OF THAT SPECIES OF DESERTS WHOSE CONCENTRATED HIDEOUSNESS SHAMES THE
DIFFUSED AND DILUTED HORRORS OF SAHARA AN ALKALI DESERT
FOR
SIXTY EIGHT MILES THERE WAS BUT ONE BREAK IN IT
I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT
THIS WAS REALLY A BREAK INDEED IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT WAS NOTHING BUT A
WATERING DEPOT IN THE MIDST OF THE STRETCH OF SIXTY EIGHT MILES
IF MY
MEMORY SERVES ME THERE WAS NO WELL OR SPRING AT THIS PLACE BUT THE
WATER WAS HAULED THERE BY MULE AND OX TEAMS FROM THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE
DESERT
THERE WAS A STAGE STATION THERE
IT WAS FORTY FIVE MILES FROM
THE BEGINNING OF THE DESERT AND TWENTY THREE FROM THE END OF IT
WE PLOWED AND DRAGGED AND GROPED ALONG THE WHOLE LIVE LONG NIGHT
AND AT THE END OF THIS UNCOMFORTABLE TWELVE HOURS WE FINISHED THE
FORTY FIVE MILE PART OF THE DESERT AND GOT TO THE STAGE STATION WHERE THE
IMPORTED WATER WAS
THE SUN WAS JUST RISING
IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO
CROSS A DESERT IN THE NIGHT WHILE WE WERE ASLEEP AND IT WAS PLEASANT TO
REFLECT IN THE MORNING THAT WE IN ACTUAL PERSON HAD ENCOUNTERED AN
ABSOLUTE DESERT AND COULD ALWAYS SPEAK KNOWINGLY OF DESERTS IN PRESENCE
OF THE IGNORANT THENCEFORWARD
AND IT WAS PLEASANT ALSO TO REFLECT THAT
THIS WAS NOT AN OBSCURE BACK COUNTRY DESERT BUT A VERY CELEBRATED ONE
THE METROPOLIS ITSELF AS YOU MAY SAY
ALL THIS WAS VERY WELL AND VERY
COMFORTABLE AND SATISFACTORY BUT NOW WE WERE TO CROSS A DESERT IN
DAYLIGHT
THIS WAS FINE NOVEL ROMANTIC DRAMATICALLY ADVENTUROUS
THIS INDEED WAS WORTH LIVING FOR WORTH TRAVELING FOR WE WOULD
WRITE HOME ALL ABOUT IT
THIS ENTHUSIASM THIS STERN THIRST FOR ADVENTURE WILTED UNDER THE SULTRY
AUGUST SUN AND DID NOT LAST ABOVE ONE HOUR
ONE POOR LITTLE HOUR AND
THEN WE WERE ASHAMED THAT WE HAD GUSHED SO
THE POETRY WAS ALL IN THE
ANTICIPATION THERE IS NONE IN THE REALITY
IMAGINE A VAST WAVELESS
OCEAN STRICKEN DEAD AND TURNED TO ASHES IMAGINE THIS SOLEMN WASTE TUFTED
WITH ASH DUSTED SAGE BUSHES IMAGINE THE LIFELESS SILENCE AND SOLITUDE
THAT BELONG TO SUCH A PLACE IMAGINE A COACH CREEPING LIKE A BUG THROUGH
THE MIDST OF THIS SHORELESS LEVEL AND SENDING UP TUMBLED VOLUMES OF DUST
AS IF IT WERE A BUG THAT WENT BY STEAM IMAGINE THIS ACHING MONOTONY OF
TOILING AND PLOWING KEPT UP HOUR AFTER HOUR AND THE SHORE STILL AS FAR
AWAY AS EVER APPARENTLY IMAGINE TEAM DRIVER COACH AND PASSENGERS SO
DEEPLY COATED WITH ASHES THAT THEY ARE ALL ONE COLORLESS COLOR IMAGINE
ASH DRIFTS ROOSTING ABOVE MOUSTACHES AND EYEBROWS LIKE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS
ON BOUGHS AND BUSHES
THIS IS THE REALITY OF IT
THE SUN BEATS DOWN WITH DEAD BLISTERING RELENTLESS MALIGNITY THE
PERSPIRATION IS WELLING FROM EVERY PORE IN MAN AND BEAST BUT SCARCELY A
SIGN OF IT FINDS ITS WAY TO THE SURFACE IT IS ABSORBED BEFORE IT GETS
THERE THERE IS NOT THE FAINTEST BREATH OF AIR STIRRING THERE IS NOT A
MERCIFUL SHRED OF CLOUD IN ALL THE BRILLIANT FIRMAMENT THERE IS NOT A
LIVING CREATURE VISIBLE IN ANY DIRECTION WHITHER ONE SEARCHES THE BLANK
LEVEL THAT STRETCHES ITS MONOTONOUS MILES ON EVERY HAND THERE IS NOT A
SOUND NOT A SIGH NOT A WHISPER NOT A BUZZ OR A WHIR OF WINGS OR
DISTANT PIPE OF BIRD NOT EVEN A SOB FROM THE LOST SOULS THAT DOUBTLESS
PEOPLE THAT DEAD AIR
AND SO THE OCCASIONAL SNEEZING OF THE RESTING
MULES AND THE CHAMPING OF THE BITS GRATE HARSHLY ON THE GRIM STILLNESS
NOT DISSIPATING THE SPELL BUT ACCENTING IT AND MAKING ONE FEEL MORE
LONESOME AND FORSAKEN THAN BEFORE
THE MULES UNDER VIOLENT SWEARING COAXING AND WHIP CRACKING WOULD MAKE
AT STATED INTERVALS A SPURT AND DRAG THE COACH A HUNDRED OR MAY BE TWO
HUNDRED YARDS STIRRING UP A BILLOWY CLOUD OF DUST THAT ROLLED BACK
ENVELOPING THE VEHICLE TO THE WHEEL TOPS OR HIGHER AND MAKING IT SEEM
AFLOAT IN A FOG
THEN A REST FOLLOWED WITH THE USUAL SNEEZING AND
BIT CHAMPING
THEN ANOTHER SPURT OF A HUNDRED YARDS AND ANOTHER REST AT
THE END OF IT
ALL DAY LONG WE KEPT THIS UP WITHOUT WATER FOR THE MULES
AND WITHOUT EVER CHANGING THE TEAM
AT LEAST WE KEPT IT UP TEN HOURS
WHICH I TAKE IT IS A DAY AND A PRETTY HONEST ONE IN AN ALKALI DESERT
IT WAS FROM FOUR IN THE MORNING TILL TWO IN THE AFTERNOON
AND IT WAS SO
HOT AND SO CLOSE AND OUR WATER CANTEENS WENT DRY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
DAY AND WE GOT SO THIRSTY IT WAS SO STUPID AND TIRESOME AND DULL AND
THE TEDIOUS HOURS DID LAG AND DRAG AND LIMP ALONG WITH SUCH A CRUEL
DELIBERATION IT WAS SO TRYING TO GIVE ONE'S WATCH A GOOD LONG
UNDISTURBED SPELL AND THEN TAKE IT OUT AND FIND THAT IT HAD BEEN FOOLING
AWAY THE TIME AND NOT TRYING TO GET AHEAD ANY THE ALKALI DUST CUT
THROUGH OUR LIPS IT PERSECUTED OUR EYES IT ATE THROUGH THE DELICATE
MEMBRANES AND MADE OUR NOSES BLEED AND KEPT THEM BLEEDING AND TRULY AND
SERIOUSLY THE ROMANCE ALL FADED FAR AWAY AND DISAPPEARED AND LEFT THE
DESERT TRIP NOTHING BUT A HARSH REALITY A THIRSTY SWELTERING LONGING
HATEFUL REALITY
TWO MILES AND A QUARTER AN HOUR FOR TEN HOURS THAT WAS WHAT WE
ACCOMPLISHED
IT WAS HARD TO BRING THE COMPREHENSION AWAY DOWN TO SUCH A
SNAIL PACE AS THAT WHEN WE HAD BEEN USED TO MAKING EIGHT AND TEN MILES
AN HOUR
WHEN WE REACHED THE STATION ON THE FARTHER VERGE OF THE DESERT
WE WERE GLAD FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DICTIONARY WAS ALONG BECAUSE
WE NEVER COULD HAVE FOUND LANGUAGE TO TELL HOW GLAD WE WERE IN ANY SORT
OF DICTIONARY BUT AN UNABRIDGED ONE WITH PICTURES IN IT
BUT THERE COULD
NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN A WHOLE LIBRARY OF DICTIONARIES LANGUAGE
SUFFICIENT TO TELL HOW TIRED THOSE MULES WERE AFTER THEIR TWENTY THREE
MILE PULL
TO TRY TO GIVE THE READER AN IDEA OF HOW THIRSTY THEY WERE
WOULD BE TO GILD REFINED GOLD OR PAINT THE LILY
SOMEHOW NOW THAT IT IS THERE THE QUOTATION DOES NOT SEEM TO FIT BUT NO
MATTER LET IT STAY ANYHOW
I THINK IT IS A GRACEFUL AND ATTRACTIVE
THING AND THEREFORE HAVE TRIED TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO WORK IT IN WHERE
IT WOULD FIT BUT COULD NOT SUCCEED
THESE EFFORTS HAVE KEPT MY MIND
DISTRACTED AND ILL AT EASE AND MADE MY NARRATIVE SEEM BROKEN AND
DISJOINTED IN PLACES
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SEEMS TO ME BEST TO
LEAVE IT IN AS ABOVE SINCE THIS WILL AFFORD AT LEAST A TEMPORARY
RESPITE FROM THE WEAR AND TEAR OF TRYING TO LEAD UP TO THIS REALLY APT
AND BEAUTIFUL QUOTATION
CHAPTER XIX
ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTEENTH DAY OUT FROM ST
JOSEPH WE ARRIVED AT THE
ENTRANCE OF ROCKY CANYON TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM SALT LAKE
IT WAS ALONG IN THIS WILD COUNTRY SOMEWHERE AND FAR FROM ANY HABITATION
OF WHITE MEN EXCEPT THE STAGE STATIONS THAT WE CAME ACROSS THE
WRETCHEDEST TYPE OF MANKIND I HAVE EVER SEEN UP TO THIS WRITING
I
REFER TO THE GOSHOOT INDIANS
FROM WHAT WE COULD SEE AND ALL WE COULD
LEARN THEY ARE VERY CONSIDERABLY INFERIOR TO EVEN THE DESPISED DIGGER
INDIANS OF CALIFORNIA INFERIOR TO ALL RACES OF SAVAGES ON OUR CONTINENT
INFERIOR TO EVEN THE TERRA DEL FUEGANS INFERIOR TO THE HOTTENTOTS AND
ACTUALLY INFERIOR IN SOME RESPECTS TO THE KYTCHES OF AFRICA
INDEED I
HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO LOOK THE BULKY VOLUMES OF WOOD'S UNCIVILIZED RACES
OF MEN CLEAR THROUGH IN ORDER TO FIND A SAVAGE TRIBE DEGRADED ENOUGH TO
TAKE RANK WITH THE GOSHOOTS
I FIND BUT ONE PEOPLE FAIRLY OPEN TO THAT
SHAMEFUL VERDICT
IT IS THE BOSJESMANS BUSHMEN OF SOUTH AFRICA
SUCH
OF THE GOSHOOTS AS WE SAW ALONG THE ROAD AND HANGING ABOUT THE STATIONS
WERE SMALL LEAN SCRAWNY CREATURES IN COMPLEXION A DULL BLACK LIKE
THE ORDINARY AMERICAN NEGRO THEIR FACES AND HANDS BEARING DIRT WHICH
THEY HAD BEEN HOARDING AND ACCUMULATING FOR MONTHS YEARS AND EVEN
GENERATIONS ACCORDING TO THE AGE OF THE PROPRIETOR A SILENT SNEAKING
TREACHEROUS LOOKING RACE TAKING NOTE OF EVERYTHING COVERTLY LIKE ALL
THE OTHER NOBLE RED MEN THAT WE DO NOT READ ABOUT AND BETRAYING NO
SIGN IN THEIR COUNTENANCES INDOLENT EVERLASTINGLY PATIENT AND TIRELESS
LIKE ALL OTHER INDIANS PRIDELESS BEGGARS FOR IF THE BEGGAR INSTINCT
WERE LEFT OUT OF AN INDIAN HE WOULD NOT GO ANY MORE THAN A CLOCK
WITHOUT A PENDULUM HUNGRY ALWAYS HUNGRY AND YET NEVER REFUSING
ANYTHING THAT A HOG WOULD EAT THOUGH OFTEN EATING WHAT A HOG WOULD
DECLINE HUNTERS BUT HAVING NO HIGHER AMBITION THAN TO KILL AND EAT
JACK ASS RABBITS CRICKETS AND GRASSHOPPERS AND EMBEZZLE CARRION FROM
THE BUZZARDS AND CAYOTES SAVAGES WHO WHEN ASKED IF THEY HAVE THE COMMON
INDIAN BELIEF IN A GREAT SPIRIT SHOW A SOMETHING WHICH ALMOST AMOUNTS TO
EMOTION THINKING WHISKEY IS REFERRED TO A THIN SCATTERING RACE OF
ALMOST NAKED BLACK CHILDREN THESE GOSHOOTS ARE WHO PRODUCE NOTHING AT
ALL AND HAVE NO VILLAGES AND NO GATHERINGS TOGETHER INTO STRICTLY
DEFINED TRIBAL COMMUNITIES A PEOPLE WHOSE ONLY SHELTER IS A RAG CAST ON
A BUSH TO KEEP OFF A PORTION OF THE SNOW AND YET WHO INHABIT ONE OF THE
MOST ROCKY WINTRY REPULSIVE WASTES THAT OUR COUNTRY OR ANY OTHER CAN
EXHIBIT
THE BUSHMEN AND OUR GOSHOOTS ARE MANIFESTLY DESCENDED FROM THE SELF SAME
GORILLA OR KANGAROO OR NORWAY RAT WHICH EVER ANIMAL ADAM THE
DARWINIANS TRACE THEM TO
ONE WOULD AS SOON EXPECT THE RABBITS TO FIGHT AS THE GOSHOOTS AND YET
THEY USED TO LIVE OFF THE OFFAL AND REFUSE OF THE STATIONS A FEW MONTHS
AND THEN COME SOME DARK NIGHT WHEN NO MISCHIEF WAS EXPECTED AND BURN
DOWN THE BUILDINGS AND KILL THE MEN FROM AMBUSH AS THEY RUSHED OUT
AND ONCE IN THE NIGHT THEY ATTACKED THE STAGE COACH WHEN A DISTRICT
JUDGE OF NEVADA TERRITORY WAS THE ONLY PASSENGER AND WITH THEIR FIRST
VOLLEY OF ARROWS AND A BULLET OR TWO THEY RIDDLED THE STAGE CURTAINS
WOUNDED A HORSE OR TWO AND MORTALLY WOUNDED THE DRIVER
THE LATTER WAS
FULL OF PLUCK AND SO WAS HIS PASSENGER
AT THE DRIVER'S CALL JUDGE MOTT
SWUNG HIMSELF OUT CLAMBERED TO THE BOX AND SEIZED THE REINS OF THE TEAM
AND AWAY THEY PLUNGED THROUGH THE RACING MOB OF SKELETONS AND UNDER A
HURTLING STORM OF MISSILES
THE STRICKEN DRIVER HAD SUNK DOWN ON THE
BOOT AS SOON AS HE WAS WOUNDED BUT HAD HELD ON TO THE REINS AND SAID HE
WOULD MANAGE TO KEEP HOLD OF THEM UNTIL RELIEVED
AND AFTER THEY WERE TAKEN FROM HIS RELAXING GRASP HE LAY WITH HIS HEAD
BETWEEN JUDGE MOTT'S FEET AND TRANQUILLY GAVE DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE ROAD
HE SAID HE BELIEVED HE COULD LIVE TILL THE MISCREANTS WERE OUTRUN AND
LEFT BEHIND AND THAT IF HE MANAGED THAT THE MAIN DIFFICULTY WOULD BE AT
AN END AND THEN IF THE JUDGE DROVE SO AND SO GIVING DIRECTIONS ABOUT
BAD PLACES IN THE ROAD AND GENERAL COURSE HE WOULD REACH THE NEXT
STATION WITHOUT TROUBLE
THE JUDGE DISTANCED THE ENEMY AND AT LAST
RATTLED UP TO THE STATION AND KNEW THAT THE NIGHT'S PERILS WERE DONE BUT
THERE WAS NO COMRADE IN ARMS FOR HIM TO REJOICE WITH FOR THE SOLDIERLY
DRIVER WAS DEAD
LET US FORGET THAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING HARSH THINGS ABOUT THE OVERLAND
DRIVERS NOW
THE DISGUST WHICH THE GOSHOOTS GAVE ME A DISCIPLE OF
COOPER AND A WORSHIPPER OF THE RED MAN EVEN OF THE SCHOLARLY SAVAGES IN
THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS WHO ARE FITTINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH BACKWOODSMEN
WHO DIVIDE EACH SENTENCE INTO TWO EQUAL PARTS ONE PART CRITICALLY
GRAMMATICAL REFINED AND CHOICE OF LANGUAGE AND THE OTHER PART JUST SUCH
AN ATTEMPT TO TALK LIKE A HUNTER OR A MOUNTAINEER AS A BROADWAY CLERK
MIGHT MAKE AFTER EATING AN EDITION OF EMERSON BENNETT'S WORKS AND
STUDYING FRONTIER LIFE AT THE BOWERY THEATRE A COUPLE OF WEEKS I SAY
THAT THE NAUSEA WHICH THE GOSHOOTS GAVE ME AN INDIAN WORSHIPPER SET ME
TO EXAMINING AUTHORITIES TO SEE IF PERCHANCE I HAD BEEN OVER ESTIMATING
THE RED MAN WHILE VIEWING HIM THROUGH THE MELLOW MOONSHINE OF ROMANCE
THE REVELATIONS THAT CAME WERE DISENCHANTING
IT WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW
QUICKLY THE PAINT AND TINSEL FELL AWAY FROM HIM AND LEFT HIM TREACHEROUS
FILTHY AND REPULSIVE AND HOW QUICKLY THE EVIDENCES ACCUMULATED THAT
WHEREVER ONE FINDS AN INDIAN TRIBE HE HAS ONLY FOUND GOSHOOTS MORE OR
LESS MODIFIED BY CIRCUMSTANCES AND SURROUNDINGS BUT GOSHOOTS AFTER ALL
THEY DESERVE PITY POOR CREATURES AND THEY CAN HAVE MINE AT THIS
DISTANCE
NEARER BY THEY NEVER GET ANYBODY'S
THERE IS AN IMPRESSION ABROAD THAT THE BALTIMORE AND WASHINGTON RAILROAD
COMPANY AND MANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES ARE GOSHOOTS BUT IT IS AN ERROR
THERE IS ONLY A PLAUSIBLE RESEMBLANCE WHICH WHILE IT IS APT ENOUGH TO
MISLEAD THE IGNORANT CANNOT DECEIVE PARTIES WHO HAVE CONTEMPLATED BOTH
TRIBES
BUT SERIOUSLY IT WAS NOT ONLY POOR WIT BUT VERY WRONG TO START
THE REPORT REFERRED TO ABOVE FOR HOWEVER INNOCENT THE MOTIVE MAY HAVE
BEEN THE NECESSARY EFFECT WAS TO INJURE THE REPUTATION OF A CLASS WHO
HAVE A HARD ENOUGH TIME OF IT IN THE PITILESS DESERTS OF THE ROCKY
MOUNTAINS HEAVEN KNOWS IF WE CANNOT FIND IT IN OUR HEARTS TO GIVE
THOSE POOR NAKED CREATURES OUR CHRISTIAN SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION IN
GOD'S NAME LET US AT LEAST NOT THROW MUD AT THEM
CHAPTER XX
ON THE SEVENTEENTH DAY WE PASSED THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN PEAKS WE HAD YET
SEEN AND ALTHOUGH THE DAY WAS VERY WARM THE NIGHT THAT FOLLOWED UPON ITS
HEELS WAS WINTRY COLD AND BLANKETS WERE NEXT TO USELESS
ON THE EIGHTEENTH DAY WE ENCOUNTERED THE EASTWARD BOUND
TELEGRAPH CONSTRUCTORS AT REESE RIVER STATION AND SENT A MESSAGE TO HIS
EXCELLENCY GOV
NYE AT CARSON CITY DISTANT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX
MILES
ON THE NINETEENTH DAY WE CROSSED THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT FORTY
MEMORABLE MILES OF BOTTOMLESS SAND INTO WHICH THE COACH WHEELS SUNK FROM
SIX INCHES TO A FOOT
WE WORKED OUR PASSAGE MOST OF THE WAY ACROSS
THAT IS TO SAY WE GOT OUT AND WALKED
IT WAS A DREARY PULL AND A LONG
AND THIRSTY ONE FOR WE HAD NO WATER
FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF THIS DESERT
TO THE OTHER THE ROAD WAS WHITE WITH THE BONES OF OXEN AND HORSES
IT WOULD HARDLY BE AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT WE COULD HAVE WALKED THE
FORTY MILES AND SET OUR FEET ON A BONE AT EVERY STEP THE DESERT WAS ONE
PRODIGIOUS GRAVEYARD
AND THE LOG CHAINS WAGON TYRES AND ROTTING
WRECKS OF VEHICLES WERE ALMOST AS THICK AS THE BONES
I THINK WE SAW
LOG CHAINS ENOUGH RUSTING THERE IN THE DESERT TO REACH ACROSS ANY STATE
IN THE UNION
DO NOT THESE RELICS SUGGEST SOMETHING OF AN IDEA OF THE
FEARFUL SUFFERING AND PRIVATION THE EARLY EMIGRANTS TO CALIFORNIA
ENDURED
AT THE BORDER OF THE DESERT LIES CARSON LAKE OR THE SINK OF THE
CARSON A SHALLOW MELANCHOLY SHEET OF WATER SOME EIGHTY OR A HUNDRED
MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
CARSON RIVER EMPTIES INTO IT AND IS LOST SINKS
MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE EARTH AND NEVER APPEARS IN THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
AGAIN FOR THE LAKE HAS NO OUTLET WHATEVER
THERE ARE SEVERAL RIVERS IN NEVADA AND THEY ALL HAVE THIS MYSTERIOUS
FATE
THEY END IN VARIOUS LAKES OR SINKS AND THAT IS THE LAST OF
THEM
CARSON LAKE HUMBOLDT LAKE WALKER LAKE MONO LAKE ARE ALL GREAT
SHEETS OF WATER WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE OUTLET
WATER IS ALWAYS FLOWING INTO
THEM NONE IS EVER SEEN TO FLOW OUT OF THEM AND YET THEY REMAIN ALWAYS
LEVEL FULL NEITHER RECEDING NOR OVERFLOWING
WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR
SURPLUS IS ONLY KNOWN TO THE CREATOR
ON THE WESTERN VERGE OF THE DESERT WE HALTED A MOMENT AT RAGTOWN
IT
CONSISTED OF ONE LOG HOUSE AND IS NOT SET DOWN ON THE MAP
THIS REMINDS ME OF A CIRCUMSTANCE
JUST AFTER WE LEFT JULESBURG ON THE
PLATTE I WAS SITTING WITH THE DRIVER AND HE SAID
I CAN TELL YOU A MOST LAUGHABLE THING INDEED IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
LISTEN TO IT
HORACE GREELEY WENT OVER THIS ROAD ONCE
WHEN HE WAS
LEAVING CARSON CITY HE TOLD THE DRIVER HANK MONK THAT HE HAD AN
ENGAGEMENT TO LECTURE AT PLACERVILLE AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO GO THROUGH
QUICK
HANK MONK CRACKED HIS WHIP AND STARTED OFF AT AN AWFUL PACE
THE COACH BOUNCED UP AND DOWN IN SUCH A TERRIFIC WAY THAT IT JOLTED THE
BUTTONS ALL OFF OF HORACE'S COAT AND FINALLY SHOT HIS HEAD CLEAN THROUGH
THE ROOF OF THE STAGE AND THEN HE YELLED AT HANK MONK AND BEGGED HIM TO
GO EASIER SAID HE WARN'T IN AS MUCH OF A HURRY AS HE WAS AWHILE AGO
BUT HANK MONK SAID 'KEEP YOUR SEAT HORACE AND I'LL GET YOU THERE ON
TIME' AND YOU BET YOU HE DID TOO WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM
A DAY OR TWO AFTER THAT WE PICKED UP A DENVER MAN AT THE CROSS ROADS AND
HE TOLD US A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE GREGORY DIGGINGS
HE SEEMED A VERY ENTERTAINING PERSON AND A MAN WELL POSTED IN THE AFFAIRS
OF COLORADO
BY AND BY HE REMARKED
I CAN TELL YOU A MOST LAUGHABLE THING INDEED IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
LISTEN TO IT
HORACE GREELEY WENT OVER THIS ROAD ONCE
WHEN HE WAS
LEAVING CARSON CITY HE TOLD THE DRIVER HANK MONK THAT HE HAD AN
ENGAGEMENT TO LECTURE AT PLACERVILLE AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO GO THROUGH
QUICK
HANK MONK CRACKED HIS WHIP AND STARTED OFF AT AN AWFUL PACE
THE
COACH BOUNCED UP AND DOWN IN SUCH A TERRIFIC WAY THAT IT JOLTED THE
BUTTONS ALL OFF OF HORACE'S COAT AND FINALLY SHOT HIS HEAD CLEAN THROUGH
THE ROOF OF THE STAGE AND THEN HE YELLED AT HANK MONK AND BEGGED HIM TO
GO EASIER SAID HE WARN'T IN AS MUCH OF A HURRY AS HE WAS AWHILE AGO
BUT HANK MONK SAID 'KEEP YOUR SEAT HORACE AND I'LL GET YOU THERE ON
TIME AND YOU BET YOU HE DID TOO WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM
AT FORT BRIDGER SOME DAYS AFTER THIS WE TOOK ON BOARD A CAVALRY
SERGEANT A VERY PROPER AND SOLDIERLY PERSON INDEED
FROM NO OTHER MAN
DURING THE WHOLE JOURNEY DID WE GATHER SUCH A STORE OF CONCISE AND
WELL ARRANGED MILITARY INFORMATION
IT WAS SURPRISING TO FIND IN THE
DESOLATE WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY A MAN SO THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH
EVERYTHING USEFUL TO KNOW IN HIS LINE OF LIFE AND YET OF SUCH INFERIOR
RANK AND UNPRETENTIOUS BEARING
FOR AS MUCH AS THREE HOURS WE LISTENED
TO HIM WITH UNABATED INTEREST
FINALLY HE GOT UPON THE SUBJECT OF
TRANS CONTINENTAL TRAVEL AND PRESENTLY SAID
I CAN TELL YOU A VERY LAUGHABLE THING INDEED IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
LISTEN TO IT
HORACE GREELEY WENT OVER THIS ROAD ONCE
WHEN HE WAS
LEAVING CARSON CITY HE TOLD THE DRIVER HANK MONK THAT HE HAD AN
ENGAGEMENT TO LECTURE AT PLACERVILLE AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO GO THROUGH
QUICK
HANK MONK CRACKED HIS WHIP AND STARTED OFF AT AN AWFUL PACE
THE
COACH BOUNCED UP AND DOWN IN SUCH A TERRIFIC WAY THAT IT JOLTED THE

GO EASIER SAID HE WARN'T IN AS MUCH OF A HURRY AS HE WAS AWHILE AGO
BUT HANK MONK SAID 'KEEP YOUR SEAT HORACE AND I'LL GET YOU THERE ON
TIME AND YOU BET YOU HE DID TOO WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM
WHEN WE WERE EIGHT HOURS OUT FROM SALT LAKE CITY A MORMON PREACHER GOT IN
WITH US AT A WAY STATION A GENTLE SOFT SPOKEN KINDLY MAN AND ONE WHOM
ANY STRANGER WOULD WARM TO AT FIRST SIGHT
I CAN NEVER FORGET THE PATHOS
THAT WAS IN HIS VOICE AS HE TOLD IN SIMPLE LANGUAGE THE STORY OF HIS
PEOPLE'S WANDERINGS AND UNPITIED SUFFERINGS
NO PULPIT ELOQUENCE WAS
EVER SO MOVING AND SO BEAUTIFUL AS THIS OUTCAST'S PICTURE OF THE FIRST
MORMON PILGRIMAGE ACROSS THE PLAINS STRUGGLING SORROWFULLY ONWARD TO THE
LAND OF ITS BANISHMENT AND MARKING ITS DESOLATE WAY WITH GRAVES AND
WATERING IT WITH TEARS
HIS WORDS SO WROUGHT UPON US THAT IT WAS A
RELIEF TO US ALL WHEN THE CONVERSATION DRIFTED INTO A MORE CHEERFUL
CHANNEL AND THE NATURAL FEATURES OF THE CURIOUS COUNTRY WE WERE IN CAME
UNDER TREATMENT
ONE MATTER AFTER ANOTHER WAS PLEASANTLY DISCUSSED AND
AT LENGTH THE STRANGER SAID
I CAN TELL YOU A MOST LAUGHABLE THING INDEED IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
LISTEN TO IT
HORACE GREELEY WENT OVER THIS ROAD ONCE
WHEN HE WAS
LEAVING CARSON CITY HE TOLD THE DRIVER HANK MONK THAT HE HAD AN
ENGAGEMENT TO LECTURE IN PLACERVILLE AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO GO THROUGH
QUICK
HANK MONK CRACKED HIS WHIP AND STARTED OFF AT AN AWFUL PACE
THE
COACH BOUNCED UP AND DOWN IN SUCH A TERRIFIC WAY THAT IT JOLTED THE
BUTTONS ALL OFF OF HORACE'S COAT AND FINALLY SHOT HIS HEAD CLEAN THROUGH
THE ROOF OF THE STAGE AND THEN HE YELLED AT HANK MONK AND BEGGED HIM TO
GO EASIER SAID HE WARN'T IN AS MUCH OF A HURRY AS HE WAS AWHILE AGO
BUT HANK MONK SAID 'KEEP YOUR SEAT HORACE AND I'LL GET YOU THERE ON
TIME AND YOU BET YOU BET YOU HE DID TOO WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM
TEN MILES OUT OF RAGTOWN WE FOUND A POOR WANDERER WHO HAD LAIN DOWN TO
DIE
HE HAD WALKED AS LONG AS HE COULD BUT HIS LIMBS HAD FAILED HIM AT
LAST
HUNGER AND FATIGUE HAD CONQUERED HIM
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INHUMAN
TO LEAVE HIM THERE
WE PAID HIS FARE TO CARSON AND LIFTED HIM INTO THE
COACH
IT WAS SOME LITTLE TIME BEFORE HE SHOWED ANY VERY DECIDED SIGNS
OF LIFE BUT BY DINT OF CHAFING HIM AND POURING BRANDY BETWEEN HIS LIPS
WE FINALLY BROUGHT HIM TO A LANGUID CONSCIOUSNESS
THEN WE FED HIM A
LITTLE AND BY AND BY HE SEEMED TO COMPREHEND THE SITUATION AND A
GRATEFUL LIGHT SOFTENED HIS EYE
WE MADE HIS MAIL SACK BED AS
COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE AND CONSTRUCTED A PILLOW FOR HIM WITH OUR COATS
HE SEEMED VERY THANKFUL
THEN HE LOOKED UP IN OUR FACES AND SAID IN A
FEEBLE VOICE THAT HAD A TREMBLE OF HONEST EMOTION IN IT
GENTLEMEN I KNOW NOT WHO YOU ARE BUT YOU HAVE SAVED MY LIFE AND
ALTHOUGH I CAN NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAY YOU FOR IT I FEEL THAT I CAN AT
LEAST MAKE ONE HOUR OF YOUR LONG JOURNEY LIGHTER
I TAKE IT YOU ARE
STRANGERS TO THIS GREAT THOROUGH FARE BUT I AM ENTIRELY FAMILIAR WITH
IT
IN THIS CONNECTION I CAN TELL YOU A MOST LAUGHABLE THING INDEED IF
YOU WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN TO IT
HORACE GREELEY
I SAID IMPRESSIVELY
SUFFERING STRANGER PROCEED AT YOUR PERIL
YOU SEE IN ME THE MELANCHOLY
WRECK OF A ONCE STALWART AND MAGNIFICENT MANHOOD
WHAT HAS BROUGHT ME TO
THIS THAT THING WHICH YOU ARE ABOUT TO TELL
GRADUALLY BUT SURELY
THAT TIRESOME OLD ANECDOTE HAS SAPPED MY STRENGTH UNDERMINED MY
CONSTITUTION WITHERED MY LIFE
PITY MY HELPLESSNESS
SPARE ME ONLY
JUST THIS ONCE AND TELL ME ABOUT YOUNG GEORGE WASHINGTON AND HIS LITTLE
HATCHET FOR A CHANGE
WE WERE SAVED
BUT NOT SO THE INVALID
IN TRYING TO RETAIN THE ANECDOTE
IN HIS SYSTEM HE STRAINED HIMSELF AND DIED IN OUR ARMS
I AM AWARE NOW THAT I OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ASKED OF THE STURDIEST CITIZEN
OF ALL THAT REGION WHAT I ASKED OF THAT MERE SHADOW OF A MAN FOR AFTER
SEVEN YEARS' RESIDENCE ON THE PACIFIC COAST I KNOW THAT NO PASSENGER OR
DRIVER ON THE OVERLAND EVER CORKED THAT ANECDOTE IN WHEN A STRANGER WAS
BY AND SURVIVED
WITHIN A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS I CROSSED AND RECROSSED
THE SIERRAS BETWEEN NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA THIRTEEN TIMES BY STAGE AND
LISTENED TO THAT DEATHLESS INCIDENT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE OR
EIGHTY TWO TIMES
I HAVE THE LIST SOMEWHERE
DRIVERS ALWAYS TOLD IT
CONDUCTORS TOLD IT LANDLORDS TOLD IT CHANCE PASSENGERS TOLD IT THE
VERY CHINAMEN AND VAGRANT INDIANS RECOUNTED IT
I HAVE HAD THE SAME
DRIVER TELL IT TO ME TWO OR THREE TIMES IN THE SAME AFTERNOON
IT HAS
COME TO ME IN ALL THE MULTITUDE OF TONGUES THAT BABEL BEQUEATHED TO
EARTH AND FLAVORED WITH WHISKEY BRANDY BEER COLOGNE SOZODONT
TOBACCO GARLIC ONIONS GRASSHOPPERS EVERYTHING THAT HAS A FRAGRANCE TO
IT THROUGH ALL THE LONG LIST OF THINGS THAT ARE GORGED OR GUZZLED BY THE
SONS OF MEN
I NEVER HAVE SMELT ANY ANECDOTE AS OFTEN AS I HAVE SMELT
THAT ONE NEVER HAVE SMELT ANY ANECDOTE THAT SMELT SO VARIEGATED AS THAT
ONE
AND YOU NEVER COULD LEARN TO KNOW IT BY ITS SMELL BECAUSE EVERY
TIME YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD LEARNED THE SMELL OF IT IT WOULD TURN UP WITH A
DIFFERENT SMELL
BAYARD TAYLOR HAS WRITTEN ABOUT THIS HOARY ANECDOTE
RICHARDSON HAS PUBLISHED IT SO HAVE JONES SMITH JOHNSON ROSS BROWNE
AND EVERY OTHER CORRESPONDENCE INDITING BEING THAT EVER SET HIS FOOT UPON
THE GREAT OVERLAND ROAD ANYWHERE BETWEEN JULESBURG AND SAN FRANCISCO AND
I HAVE HEARD THAT IT IS IN THE TALMUD
I HAVE SEEN IT IN PRINT IN NINE
DIFFERENT FOREIGN LANGUAGES I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS EMPLOYED IN THE
INQUISITION IN ROME AND I NOW LEARN WITH REGRET THAT IT IS GOING TO BE
SET TO MUSIC
I DO NOT THINK THAT SUCH THINGS ARE RIGHT
STAGE COACHING ON THE OVERLAND IS NO MORE AND STAGE DRIVERS ARE A RACE
DEFUNCT
I WONDER IF THEY BEQUEATHED THAT BALD HEADED ANECDOTE TO THEIR
SUCCESSORS THE RAILROAD BRAKEMEN AND CONDUCTORS AND IF THESE LATTER
STILL PERSECUTE THE HELPLESS PASSENGER WITH IT UNTIL HE CONCLUDES AS DID
MANY A TOURIST OF OTHER DAYS THAT THE REAL GRANDEURS OF THE PACIFIC
COAST ARE NOT YO SEMITE AND THE BIG TREES BUT HANK MONK AND HIS
ADVENTURE WITH HORACE GREELEY
AND WHAT MAKES THAT WORN ANECDOTE THE
MORE AGGRAVATING IS THAT THE ADVENTURE IT CELEBRATES NEVER OCCURRED
IF IT WERE A GOOD ANECDOTE THAT SEEMING DEMERIT WOULD BE ITS CHIEFEST
VIRTUE FOR CREATIVE POWER BELONGS TO GREATNESS BUT WHAT OUGHT TO BE
DONE TO A MAN WHO WOULD WANTONLY CONTRIVE SO FLAT A ONE AS THIS IF I
WERE TO SUGGEST WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO HIM I SHOULD BE CALLED
EXTRAVAGANT BUT WHAT DOES THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER OF DANIEL SAY AHA
CHAPTER XXI
WE WERE APPROACHING THE END OF OUR LONG JOURNEY
IT WAS THE MORNING OF
THE TWENTIETH DAY
AT NOON WE WOULD REACH CARSON CITY THE CAPITAL OF
NEVADA TERRITORY
WE WERE NOT GLAD BUT SORRY
IT HAD BEEN A FINE
PLEASURE TRIP WE HAD FED FAT ON WONDERS EVERY DAY WE WERE NOW WELL
ACCUSTOMED TO STAGE LIFE AND VERY FOND OF IT SO THE IDEA OF COMING TO A
STAND STILL AND SETTLING DOWN TO A HUMDRUM EXISTENCE IN A VILLAGE WAS NOT
AGREEABLE BUT ON THE CONTRARY DEPRESSING
VISIBLY OUR NEW HOME WAS A DESERT WALLED IN BY BARREN SNOW CLAD
MOUNTAINS
THERE WAS NOT A TREE IN SIGHT
THERE WAS NO VEGETATION BUT
THE ENDLESS SAGE BRUSH AND GREASEWOOD
ALL NATURE WAS GRAY WITH IT
WE
WERE PLOWING THROUGH GREAT DEEPS OF POWDERY ALKALI DUST THAT ROSE IN
THICK CLOUDS AND FLOATED ACROSS THE PLAIN LIKE SMOKE FROM A BURNING
HOUSE
WE WERE COATED WITH IT LIKE MILLERS SO WERE THE COACH THE MULES THE
MAIL BAGS THE DRIVER WE AND THE SAGE BRUSH AND THE OTHER SCENERY WERE
ALL ONE MONOTONOUS COLOR
LONG TRAINS OF FREIGHT WAGONS IN THE DISTANCE
ENVELOPE IN ASCENDING MASSES OF DUST SUGGESTED PICTURES OF PRAIRIES ON
FIRE
THESE TEAMS AND THEIR MASTERS WERE THE ONLY LIFE WE SAW
OTHERWISE WE MOVED IN THE MIDST OF SOLITUDE SILENCE AND DESOLATION
EVERY TWENTY STEPS WE PASSED THE SKELETON OF SOME DEAD BEAST OF BURTHEN
WITH ITS DUST COATED SKIN STRETCHED TIGHTLY OVER ITS EMPTY RIBS
FREQUENTLY A SOLEMN RAVEN SAT UPON THE SKULL OR THE HIPS AND CONTEMPLATED
THE PASSING COACH WITH MEDITATIVE SERENITY
BY AND BY CARSON CITY WAS POINTED OUT TO US
IT NESTLED IN THE EDGE OF A
GREAT PLAIN AND WAS A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF MILES AWAY TO LOOK LIKE AN
ASSEMBLAGE OF MERE WHITE SPOTS IN THE SHADOW OF A GRIM RANGE OF MOUNTAINS
OVERLOOKING IT WHOSE SUMMITS SEEMED LIFTED CLEAR OUT OF COMPANIONSHIP
AND CONSCIOUSNESS OF EARTHLY THINGS
WE ARRIVED DISEMBARKED AND THE STAGE WENT ON
IT WAS A WOODEN TOWN
ITS POPULATION TWO THOUSAND SOULS
THE MAIN STREET CONSISTED OF FOUR OR
FIVE BLOCKS OF LITTLE WHITE FRAME STORES WHICH WERE TOO HIGH TO SIT DOWN
ON BUT NOT TOO HIGH FOR VARIOUS OTHER PURPOSES IN FACT HARDLY HIGH
ENOUGH
THEY WERE PACKED CLOSE TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE AS IF ROOM WERE
SCARCE IN THAT MIGHTY PLAIN
THE SIDEWALK WAS OF BOARDS THAT WERE MORE OR LESS LOOSE AND INCLINED TO
RATTLE WHEN WALKED UPON
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOWN OPPOSITE THE STORES
WAS THE PLAZA WHICH IS NATIVE TO ALL TOWNS BEYOND THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
A LARGE UNFENCED LEVEL VACANCY WITH A LIBERTY POLE IN IT AND VERY
USEFUL AS A PLACE FOR PUBLIC AUCTIONS HORSE TRADES AND MASS MEETINGS
AND LIKEWISE FOR TEAMSTERS TO CAMP IN
TWO OTHER SIDES OF THE PLAZA WERE
FACED BY STORES OFFICES AND STABLES
THE REST OF CARSON CITY WAS PRETTY SCATTERING
WE WERE INTRODUCED TO SEVERAL CITIZENS AT THE STAGE OFFICE AND ON THE
WAY UP TO THE GOVERNOR'S FROM THE HOTEL AMONG OTHERS TO A MR
HARRIS
WHO WAS ON HORSEBACK HE BEGAN TO SAY SOMETHING BUT INTERRUPTED HIMSELF
WITH THE REMARK
I'LL HAVE TO GET YOU TO EXCUSE ME A MINUTE YONDER IS THE WITNESS THAT
SWORE I HELPED TO ROB THE CALIFORNIA COACH A PIECE OF IMPERTINENT
INTERMEDDLING SIR FOR I AM NOT EVEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE MAN
THEN HE RODE OVER AND BEGAN TO REBUKE THE STRANGER WITH A SIX SHOOTER
AND THE STRANGER BEGAN TO EXPLAIN WITH ANOTHER
WHEN THE PISTOLS WERE
EMPTIED THE STRANGER RESUMED HIS WORK MENDING A WHIP LASH AND MR
HARRIS RODE BY WITH A POLITE NOD HOMEWARD BOUND WITH A BULLET THROUGH
ONE OF HIS LUNGS AND SEVERAL IN HIS HIPS AND FROM THEM ISSUED LITTLE
RIVULETS OF BLOOD THAT COURSED DOWN THE HORSE'S SIDES AND MADE THE ANIMAL
LOOK QUITE PICTURESQUE
I NEVER SAW HARRIS SHOOT A MAN AFTER THAT BUT IT
RECALLED TO MIND THAT FIRST DAY IN CARSON
THIS WAS ALL WE SAW THAT DAY FOR IT WAS TWO O'CLOCK NOW AND ACCORDING
TO CUSTOM THE DAILY WASHOE ZEPHYR SET IN A SOARING DUST DRIFT ABOUT
THE SIZE OF THE UNITED STATES SET UP EDGEWISE CAME WITH IT AND THE
CAPITAL OF NEVADA TERRITORY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW
STILL THERE WERE SIGHTS TO BE SEEN WHICH WERE NOT WHOLLY UNINTERESTING
TO NEW COMERS FOR THE VAST DUST CLOUD WAS THICKLY FRECKLED WITH THINGS
STRANGE TO THE UPPER AIR THINGS LIVING AND DEAD THAT FLITTED HITHER AND
THITHER GOING AND COMING APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING AMONG THE ROLLING
BILLOWS OF DUST HATS CHICKENS AND PARASOLS SAILING IN THE REMOTE
HEAVENS BLANKETS TIN SIGNS SAGE BRUSH AND SHINGLES A SHADE LOWER
DOOR MATS AND BUFFALO ROBES LOWER STILL SHOVELS AND COAL SCUTTLES ON THE
NEXT GRADE GLASS DOORS CATS AND LITTLE CHILDREN ON THE NEXT DISRUPTED
LUMBER YARDS LIGHT BUGGIES AND WHEELBARROWS ON THE NEXT AND DOWN ONLY
THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE GROUND WAS A SCURRYING STORM OF EMIGRATING
ROOFS AND VACANT LOTS
IT WAS SOMETHING TO SEE THAT MUCH
I COULD HAVE SEEN MORE IF I COULD
HAVE KEPT THE DUST OUT OF MY EYES
BUT SERIOUSLY A WASHOE WIND IS BY NO MEANS A TRIFLING MATTER
IT BLOWS
FLIMSY HOUSES DOWN LIFTS SHINGLE ROOFS OCCASIONALLY ROLLS UP TIN ONES
LIKE SHEET MUSIC NOW AND THEN BLOWS A STAGE COACH OVER AND SPILLS THE
PASSENGERS AND TRADITION SAYS THE REASON THERE ARE SO MANY BALD PEOPLE
THERE IS THAT THE WIND BLOWS THE HAIR OFF THEIR HEADS WHILE THEY ARE
LOOKING SKYWARD AFTER THEIR HATS
CARSON STREETS SELDOM LOOK INACTIVE ON
SUMMER AFTERNOONS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY CITIZENS SKIPPING AROUND
THEIR ESCAPING HATS LIKE CHAMBERMAIDS TRYING TO HEAD OFF A SPIDER
THE WASHOE ZEPHYR WASHOE IS A PET NICKNAME FOR NEVADA IS A PECULIAR
SCRIPTURAL WIND IN THAT NO MAN KNOWETH WHENCE IT COMETH THAT IS TO
SAY WHERE IT ORIGINATES
IT COMES RIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS FROM THE
WEST BUT WHEN ONE CROSSES THE RIDGE HE DOES NOT FIND ANY OF IT ON THE
OTHER SIDE IT PROBABLY IS MANUFACTURED ON THE MOUNTAIN TOP FOR THE
OCCASION AND STARTS FROM THERE
IT IS A PRETTY REGULAR WIND IN THE
SUMMER TIME
ITS OFFICE HOURS ARE FROM TWO IN THE AFTERNOON TILL TWO THE
NEXT MORNING AND ANYBODY VENTURING ABROAD DURING THOSE TWELVE HOURS
NEEDS TO ALLOW FOR THE WIND OR HE WILL BRING UP A MILE OR TWO TO LEEWARD
OF THE POINT HE IS AIMING AT
AND YET THE FIRST COMPLAINT A WASHOE
VISITOR TO SAN FRANCISCO MAKES IS THAT THE SEA WINDS BLOW SO THERE
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF HUMAN NATURE IN THAT
WE FOUND THE STATE PALACE OF THE GOVERNOR OF NEVADA TERRITORY TO CONSIST
OF A WHITE FRAME ONE STORY HOUSE WITH TWO SMALL ROOMS IN IT AND A
STANCHION SUPPORTED SHED IN FRONT FOR GRANDEUR IT COMPELLED THE RESPECT
OF THE CITIZEN AND INSPIRED THE INDIANS WITH AWE
THE NEWLY ARRIVED
CHIEF AND ASSOCIATE JUSTICES OF THE TERRITORY AND OTHER MACHINERY OF THE
GOVERNMENT WERE DOMICILED WITH LESS SPLENDOR
THEY WERE BOARDING AROUND
PRIVATELY AND HAD THEIR OFFICES IN THEIR BEDROOMS
THE SECRETARY AND I TOOK QUARTERS IN THE RANCH OF A WORTHY FRENCH LADY
BY THE NAME OF BRIDGET O'FLANNIGAN A CAMP FOLLOWER OF HIS EXCELLENCY THE
GOVERNOR
SHE HAD KNOWN HIM IN HIS PROSPERITY AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF
THE METROPOLITAN POLICE OF NEW YORK AND SHE WOULD NOT DESERT HIM IN HIS
ADVERSITY AS GOVERNOR OF NEVADA
OUR ROOM WAS ON THE LOWER FLOOR FACING THE PLAZA AND WHEN WE HAD GOT
OUR BED A SMALL TABLE TWO CHAIRS THE GOVERNMENT FIRE PROOF SAFE AND
THE UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY INTO IT THERE WAS STILL ROOM ENOUGH LEFT FOR A
VISITOR MAY BE TWO BUT NOT WITHOUT STRAINING THE WALLS
BUT THE WALLS
COULD STAND IT AT LEAST THE PARTITIONS COULD FOR THEY CONSISTED SIMPLY
OF ONE THICKNESS OF WHITE COTTON DOMESTIC STRETCHED FROM CORNER TO
CORNER OF THE ROOM
THIS WAS THE RULE IN CARSON ANY OTHER KIND OF
PARTITION WAS THE RARE EXCEPTION
AND IF YOU STOOD IN A DARK ROOM AND
YOUR NEIGHBORS IN THE NEXT HAD LIGHTS THE SHADOWS ON YOUR CANVAS TOLD
QUEER SECRETS SOMETIMES VERY OFTEN THESE PARTITIONS WERE MADE OF OLD
FLOUR SACKS BASTED TOGETHER AND THEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMMON
HERD AND THE ARISTOCRACY WAS THAT THE COMMON HERD HAD UNORNAMENTED
SACKS WHILE THE WALLS OF THE ARISTOCRAT WERE OVERPOWERING WITH
RUDIMENTAL FRESCO I E RED AND BLUE MILL BRANDS ON THE FLOUR SACKS
OCCASIONALLY ALSO THE BETTER CLASSES EMBELLISHED THEIR CANVAS BY
PASTING PICTURES FROM HARPER'S WEEKLY ON THEM
IN MANY CASES TOO THE
WEALTHY AND THE CULTURED ROSE TO SPITTOONS AND OTHER EVIDENCES OF A
SUMPTUOUS AND LUXURIOUS TASTE
WASHOE PEOPLE TAKE A JOKE SO HARD THAT I
MUST EXPLAIN THAT THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION WAS ONLY THE RULE THERE WERE
MANY HONORABLE EXCEPTIONS IN CARSON PLASTERED CEILINGS AND HOUSES THAT
HAD CONSIDERABLE FURNITURE IN THEM M
T
WE HAD A CARPET AND A GENUINE QUEEN'S WARE WASHBOWL
CONSEQUENTLY WE
WERE HATED WITHOUT RESERVE BY THE OTHER TENANTS OF THE O'FLANNIGAN
RANCH WHEN WE ADDED A PAINTED OILCLOTH WINDOW CURTAIN WE SIMPLY TOOK
OUR LIVES INTO OUR OWN HANDS
TO PREVENT BLOODSHED I REMOVED UP STAIRS
AND TOOK UP QUARTERS WITH THE UNTITLED PLEBEIANS IN ONE OF THE FOURTEEN
WHITE PINE COT BEDSTEADS THAT STOOD IN TWO LONG RANKS IN THE ONE SOLE
ROOM OF WHICH THE SECOND STORY CONSISTED
IT WAS A JOLLY COMPANY THE FOURTEEN
THEY WERE PRINCIPALLY VOLUNTARY
CAMP FOLLOWERS OF THE GOVERNOR WHO HAD JOINED HIS RETINUE BY THEIR OWN
ELECTION AT NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO AND CAME ALONG FEELING THAT IN
THE SCUFFLE FOR LITTLE TERRITORIAL CRUMBS AND OFFICES THEY COULD NOT MAKE
THEIR CONDITION MORE PRECARIOUS THAN IT WAS AND MIGHT REASONABLY EXPECT
TO MAKE IT BETTER
THEY WERE POPULARLY KNOWN AS THE IRISH BRIGADE
THOUGH THERE WERE ONLY FOUR OR FIVE IRISHMEN AMONG ALL THE GOVERNOR'S
RETAINERS
HIS GOOD NATURED EXCELLENCY WAS MUCH ANNOYED AT THE GOSSIP HIS HENCHMEN
CREATED ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE AROSE A RUMOR THAT THEY WERE PAID
ASSASSINS OF HIS BROUGHT ALONG TO QUIETLY REDUCE THE DEMOCRATIC VOTE
WHEN DESIRABLE
MRS
O'FLANNIGAN WAS BOARDING AND LODGING THEM AT TEN DOLLARS A WEEK
APIECE AND THEY WERE CHEERFULLY GIVING THEIR NOTES FOR IT
THEY WERE
PERFECTLY SATISFIED BUT BRIDGET PRESENTLY FOUND THAT NOTES THAT COULD
NOT BE DISCOUNTED WERE BUT A FEEBLE CONSTITUTION FOR A CARSON
BOARDING HOUSE
SO SHE BEGAN TO HARRY THE GOVERNOR TO FIND EMPLOYMENT
FOR THE BRIGADE HER IMPORTUNITIES AND THEIRS TOGETHER DROVE HIM TO A
GENTLE DESPERATION AT LAST AND HE FINALLY SUMMONED THE BRIGADE TO THE
PRESENCE
THEN SAID HE
GENTLEMEN I HAVE PLANNED A LUCRATIVE AND USEFUL SERVICE FOR YOU
A SERVICE WHICH WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH RECREATION AMID NOBLE LANDSCAPES
AND AFFORD YOU NEVER CEASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENRICHING YOUR MINDS BY
OBSERVATION AND STUDY
I WANT YOU TO SURVEY A RAILROAD FROM CARSON CITY
WESTWARD TO A CERTAIN POINT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE MEETS I WILL HAVE THE
NECESSARY BILL PASSED AND THE REMUNERATION ARRANGED
WHAT A RAILROAD OVER THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS
WELL THEN SURVEY IT EASTWARD TO A CERTAIN POINT
HE CONVERTED THEM INTO SURVEYORS CHAIN BEARERS AND SO ON AND TURNED
THEM LOOSE IN THE DESERT
IT WAS RECREATION WITH A VENGEANCE
RECREATION ON FOOT LUGGING CHAINS THROUGH SAND AND SAGE BRUSH UNDER A
SULTRY SUN AND AMONG CATTLE BONES CAYOTES AND TARANTULAS
ROMANTIC ADVENTURE COULD GO NO FURTHER
THEY SURVEYED VERY SLOWLY
VERY DELIBERATELY VERY CAREFULLY
THEY RETURNED EVERY NIGHT DURING THE
FIRST WEEK DUSTY FOOTSORE TIRED AND HUNGRY BUT VERY JOLLY
THEY
BROUGHT IN GREAT STORE OF PRODIGIOUS HAIRY SPIDERS TARANTULAS AND
IMPRISONED THEM IN COVERED TUMBLERS UP STAIRS IN THE RANCH AFTER THE
FIRST WEEK THEY HAD TO CAMP ON THE FIELD FOR THEY WERE GETTING WELL
EASTWARD
THEY MADE A GOOD MANY INQUIRIES AS TO THE LOCATION OF THAT
INDEFINITE CERTAIN POINT BUT GOT NO INFORMATION
AT LAST TO A
PECULIARLY URGENT INQUIRY OF HOW FAR EASTWARD GOVERNOR NYE
TELEGRAPHED BACK
TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN BLAST YOU AND THEN BRIDGE IT AND GO ON
THIS BROUGHT BACK THE DUSTY TOILERS WHO SENT IN A REPORT AND CEASED FROM
THEIR LABORS
THE GOVERNOR WAS ALWAYS COMFORTABLE ABOUT IT HE SAID MRS
O'FLANNIGAN WOULD HOLD HIM FOR THE BRIGADE'S BOARD ANYHOW AND HE
INTENDED TO GET WHAT ENTERTAINMENT HE COULD OUT OF THE BOYS HE SAID
WITH HIS OLD TIME PLEASANT TWINKLE THAT HE MEANT TO SURVEY THEM INTO
UTAH AND THEN TELEGRAPH BRIGHAM TO HANG THEM FOR TRESPASS
THE SURVEYORS BROUGHT BACK MORE TARANTULAS WITH THEM AND SO WE HAD QUITE
A MENAGERIE ARRANGED ALONG THE SHELVES OF THE ROOM
SOME OF THESE
SPIDERS COULD STRADDLE OVER A COMMON SAUCER WITH THEIR HAIRY MUSCULAR
LEGS AND WHEN THEIR FEELINGS WERE HURT OR THEIR DIGNITY OFFENDED THEY
WERE THE WICKEDEST LOOKING DESPERADOES THE ANIMAL WORLD CAN FURNISH
IF THEIR GLASS PRISON HOUSES WERE TOUCHED EVER SO LIGHTLY THEY WERE UP
AND SPOILING FOR A FIGHT IN A MINUTE
STARCHY PROUD INDEED THEY
WOULD TAKE UP A STRAW AND PICK THEIR TEETH LIKE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
THERE WAS AS USUAL A FURIOUS ZEPHYR BLOWING THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE
BRIGADE'S RETURN AND ABOUT MIDNIGHT THE ROOF OF AN ADJOINING STABLE BLEW
OFF AND A CORNER OF IT CAME CRASHING THROUGH THE SIDE OF OUR RANCH
THERE WAS A SIMULTANEOUS AWAKENING AND A TUMULTUOUS MUSTER OF THE
BRIGADE IN THE DARK AND A GENERAL TUMBLING AND SPRAWLING OVER EACH OTHER
IN THE NARROW AISLE BETWEEN THE BEDROWS
IN THE MIDST OF THE TURMOIL
BOB H SPRUNG UP OUT OF A SOUND SLEEP AND KNOCKED DOWN A SHELF WITH
HIS HEAD
INSTANTLY HE SHOUTED
TURN OUT BOYS THE TARANTULAS IS LOOSE
NO WARNING EVER SOUNDED SO DREADFUL
NOBODY TRIED ANY LONGER TO LEAVE
THE ROOM LEST HE MIGHT STEP ON A TARANTULA
EVERY MAN GROPED FOR A
TRUNK OR A BED AND JUMPED ON IT
THEN FOLLOWED THE STRANGEST SILENCE A
SILENCE OF GRISLY SUSPENSE IT WAS TOO WAITING EXPECTANCY FEAR
IT
WAS AS DARK AS PITCH AND ONE HAD TO IMAGINE THE SPECTACLE OF THOSE
FOURTEEN SCANT CLAD MEN ROOSTING GINGERLY ON TRUNKS AND BEDS FOR NOT A
THING COULD BE SEEN
THEN CAME OCCASIONAL LITTLE INTERRUPTIONS OF THE
SILENCE AND ONE COULD RECOGNIZE A MAN AND TELL HIS LOCALITY BY HIS
VOICE OR LOCATE ANY OTHER SOUND A SUFFERER MADE BY HIS GROPINGS OR
CHANGES OF POSITION
THE OCCASIONAL VOICES WERE NOT GIVEN TO MUCH
SPEAKING YOU SIMPLY HEARD A GENTLE EJACULATION OF OW FOLLOWED BY A
SOLID THUMP AND YOU KNEW THE GENTLEMAN HAD FELT A HAIRY BLANKET OR
SOMETHING TOUCH HIS BARE SKIN AND HAD SKIPPED FROM A BED TO THE FLOOR
ANOTHER SILENCE
PRESENTLY YOU WOULD HEAR A GASPING VOICE SAY
SU SU SOMETHING'S CRAWLING UP THE BACK OF MY NECK
EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU COULD HEAR A LITTLE SUBDUED SCRAMBLE AND A
SORROWFUL O LORD AND THEN YOU KNEW THAT SOMEBODY WAS GETTING AWAY FROM
SOMETHING HE TOOK FOR A TARANTULA AND NOT LOSING ANY TIME ABOUT IT
EITHER
DIRECTLY A VOICE IN THE CORNER RANG OUT WILD AND CLEAR
I'VE GOT HIM I'VE GOT HIM PAUSE AND PROBABLE CHANGE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES NO HE'S GOT ME OH AIN'T THEY NEVER GOING TO FETCH A
LANTERN
THE LANTERN CAME AT THAT MOMENT IN THE HANDS OF MRS
O'FLANNIGAN WHOSE
ANXIETY TO KNOW THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE DONE BY THE ASSAULTING ROOF HAD NOT
PREVENTED HER WAITING A JUDICIOUS INTERVAL AFTER GETTING OUT OF BED AND
LIGHTING UP TO SEE IF THE WIND WAS DONE NOW UP STAIRS OR HAD A LARGER
CONTRACT
THE LANDSCAPE PRESENTED WHEN THE LANTERN FLASHED INTO THE ROOM WAS
PICTURESQUE AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN FUNNY TO SOME PEOPLE BUT WAS NOT TO US
ALTHOUGH WE WERE PERCHED SO STRANGELY UPON BOXES TRUNKS AND BEDS AND SO
STRANGELY ATTIRED TOO WE WERE TOO EARNESTLY DISTRESSED AND TOO
GENUINELY MISERABLE TO SEE ANY FUN ABOUT IT AND THERE WAS NOT THE
SEMBLANCE OF A SMILE ANYWHERE VISIBLE
I KNOW I AM NOT CAPABLE OF
SUFFERING MORE THAN I DID DURING THOSE FEW MINUTES OF SUSPENSE IN THE
DARK SURROUNDED BY THOSE CREEPING BLOODY MINDED TARANTULAS
I HAD
SKIPPED FROM BED TO BED AND FROM BOX TO BOX IN A COLD AGONY AND EVERY
TIME I TOUCHED ANYTHING THAT WAS FURZY I FANCIED I FELT THE FANGS
I HAD
RATHER GO TO WAR THAN LIVE THAT EPISODE OVER AGAIN
NOBODY WAS HURT
THE MAN WHO THOUGHT A TARANTULA HAD GOT HIM WAS MISTAKEN ONLY A CRACK
IN A BOX HAD CAUGHT HIS FINGER
NOT ONE OF THOSE ESCAPED TARANTULAS WAS
EVER SEEN AGAIN
THERE WERE TEN OR TWELVE OF THEM
WE TOOK CANDLES AND
HUNTED THE PLACE HIGH AND LOW FOR THEM BUT WITH NO SUCCESS
DID WE GO
BACK TO BED THEN WE DID NOTHING OF THE KIND
MONEY COULD NOT HAVE
PERSUADED US TO DO IT
WE SAT UP THE REST OF THE NIGHT PLAYING CRIBBAGE
AND KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT FOR THE ENEMY
CHAPTER XXII
IT WAS THE END OF AUGUST AND THE SKIES WERE CLOUDLESS AND THE WEATHER
SUPERB
IN TWO OR THREE WEEKS I HAD GROWN WONDERFULLY FASCINATED WITH
THE CURIOUS NEW COUNTRY AND CONCLUDED TO PUT OFF MY RETURN TO THE
STATES AWHILE
I HAD GROWN WELL ACCUSTOMED TO WEARING A DAMAGED SLOUCH
HAT BLUE WOOLEN SHIRT AND PANTS CRAMMED INTO BOOT TOPS AND GLORIED IN
THE ABSENCE OF COAT VEST AND BRACES
I FELT ROWDYISH AND BULLY AS
THE HISTORIAN JOSEPHUS PHRASES IT IN HIS FINE CHAPTER UPON THE
DESTRUCTION OF THE TEMPLE
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NOTHING COULD BE SO
FINE AND SO ROMANTIC
I HAD BECOME AN OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT
THAT WAS FOR MERE SUBLIMITY
THE OFFICE WAS AN UNIQUE SINECURE
I HAD
NOTHING TO DO AND NO SALARY
I WAS PRIVATE SECRETARY TO HIS MAJESTY THE
SECRETARY AND THERE WAS NOT YET WRITING ENOUGH FOR TWO OF US
SO JOHNNY
K AND I DEVOTED OUR TIME TO AMUSEMENT
HE WAS THE YOUNG SON OF AN
OHIO NABOB AND WAS OUT THERE FOR RECREATION
HE GOT IT
WE HAD HEARD A
WORLD OF TALK ABOUT THE MARVELLOUS BEAUTY OF LAKE TAHOE AND FINALLY
CURIOSITY DROVE US THITHER TO SEE IT
THREE OR FOUR MEMBERS OF THE
BRIGADE HAD BEEN THERE AND LOCATED SOME TIMBER LANDS ON ITS SHORES AND
STORED UP A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS IN THEIR CAMP
WE STRAPPED A COUPLE
OF BLANKETS ON OUR SHOULDERS AND TOOK AN AXE APIECE AND STARTED FOR WE
INTENDED TO TAKE UP A WOOD RANCH OR SO OURSELVES AND BECOME WEALTHY
WE WERE ON FOOT
THE READER WILL FIND IT ADVANTAGEOUS TO GO HORSEBACK
WE WERE TOLD THAT THE DISTANCE WAS ELEVEN MILES
WE TRAMPED A LONG TIME
ON LEVEL GROUND AND THEN TOILED LABORIOUSLY UP A MOUNTAIN ABOUT A
THOUSAND MILES HIGH AND LOOKED OVER
NO LAKE THERE
WE DESCENDED ON THE
OTHER SIDE CROSSED THE VALLEY AND TOILED UP ANOTHER MOUNTAIN THREE OR
FOUR THOUSAND MILES HIGH APPARENTLY AND LOOKED OVER AGAIN
NO LAKE
YET
WE SAT DOWN TIRED AND PERSPIRING AND HIRED A COUPLE OF CHINAMEN TO
CURSE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEGUILED US
THUS REFRESHED WE PRESENTLY
RESUMED THE MARCH WITH RENEWED VIGOR AND DETERMINATION
WE PLODDED ON
TWO OR THREE HOURS LONGER AND AT LAST THE LAKE BURST UPON US A NOBLE
SHEET OF BLUE WATER LIFTED SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE
LEVEL OF THE SEA AND WALLED IN BY A RIM OF SNOW CLAD MOUNTAIN PEAKS THAT
TOWERED ALOFT FULL THREE THOUSAND FEET HIGHER STILL IT WAS A VAST OVAL
AND ONE WOULD HAVE TO USE UP EIGHTY OR A HUNDRED GOOD MILES IN TRAVELING
AROUND IT
AS IT LAY THERE WITH THE SHADOWS OF THE MOUNTAINS BRILLIANTLY
PHOTOGRAPHED UPON ITS STILL SURFACE I THOUGHT IT MUST SURELY BE THE
FAIREST PICTURE THE WHOLE EARTH AFFORDS
WE FOUND THE SMALL SKIFF BELONGING TO THE BRIGADE BOYS AND WITHOUT LOSS
OF TIME SET OUT ACROSS A DEEP BEND OF THE LAKE TOWARD THE LANDMARKS THAT
SIGNIFIED THE LOCALITY OF THE CAMP
I GOT JOHNNY TO ROW NOT BECAUSE I
MIND EXERTION MYSELF BUT BECAUSE IT MAKES ME SICK TO RIDE BACKWARDS WHEN
I AM AT WORK
BUT I STEERED
A THREE MILE PULL BROUGHT US TO THE CAMP
JUST AS THE NIGHT FELL AND WE STEPPED ASHORE VERY TIRED AND WOLFISHLY
HUNGRY
IN A CACHE AMONG THE ROCKS WE FOUND THE PROVISIONS AND THE
COOKING UTENSILS AND THEN ALL FATIGUED AS I WAS I SAT DOWN ON A
BOULDER AND SUPERINTENDED WHILE JOHNNY GATHERED WOOD AND COOKED SUPPER
MANY A MAN WHO HAD GONE THROUGH WHAT I HAD WOULD HAVE WANTED TO REST
IT WAS A DELICIOUS SUPPER HOT BREAD FRIED BACON AND BLACK COFFEE
IT WAS A DELICIOUS SOLITUDE WE WERE IN TOO
THREE MILES AWAY WAS A
SAW MILL AND SOME WORKMEN BUT THERE WERE NOT FIFTEEN OTHER HUMAN BEINGS
THROUGHOUT THE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE LAKE
AS THE DARKNESS CLOSED
DOWN AND THE STARS CAME OUT AND SPANGLED THE GREAT MIRROR WITH JEWELS WE
SMOKED MEDITATIVELY IN THE SOLEMN HUSH AND FORGOT OUR TROUBLES AND OUR
PAINS
IN DUE TIME WE SPREAD OUR BLANKETS IN THE WARM SAND BETWEEN TWO
LARGE BOULDERS AND SOON FEEL ASLEEP CARELESS OF THE PROCESSION OF ANTS
THAT PASSED IN THROUGH RENTS IN OUR CLOTHING AND EXPLORED OUR PERSONS
NOTHING COULD DISTURB THE SLEEP THAT FETTERED US FOR IT HAD BEEN FAIRLY
EARNED AND IF OUR CONSCIENCES HAD ANY SINS ON THEM THEY HAD TO ADJOURN
COURT FOR THAT NIGHT ANY WAY
THE WIND ROSE JUST AS WE WERE LOSING
CONSCIOUSNESS AND WE WERE LULLED TO SLEEP BY THE BEATING OF THE SURF
UPON THE SHORE
IT IS ALWAYS VERY COLD ON THAT LAKE SHORE IN THE NIGHT BUT WE HAD PLENTY
OF BLANKETS AND WERE WARM ENOUGH
WE NEVER MOVED A MUSCLE ALL NIGHT BUT
WAKED AT EARLY DAWN IN THE ORIGINAL POSITIONS AND GOT UP AT ONCE
THOROUGHLY REFRESHED FREE FROM SORENESS AND BRIM FULL OF FRISKINESS
THERE IS NO END OF WHOLESOME MEDICINE IN SUCH AN EXPERIENCE
THAT
MORNING WE COULD HAVE WHIPPED TEN SUCH PEOPLE AS WE WERE THE DAY BEFORE
SICK ONES AT ANY RATE
BUT THE WORLD IS SLOW AND PEOPLE WILL GO TO
WATER CURES AND MOVEMENT CURES AND TO FOREIGN LANDS FOR HEALTH
THREE MONTHS OF CAMP LIFE ON LAKE TAHOE WOULD RESTORE AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY
TO HIS PRISTINE VIGOR AND GIVE HIM AN APPETITE LIKE AN ALLIGATOR
I DO
NOT MEAN THE OLDEST AND DRIEST MUMMIES OF COURSE BUT THE FRESHER ONES
THE AIR UP THERE IN THE CLOUDS IS VERY PURE AND FINE BRACING AND
DELICIOUS
AND WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE IT IS THE SAME THE ANGELS BREATHE
I THINK THAT HARDLY ANY AMOUNT OF FATIGUE CAN BE GATHERED TOGETHER THAT A
MAN CANNOT SLEEP OFF IN ONE NIGHT ON THE SAND BY ITS SIDE
NOT UNDER A
ROOF BUT UNDER THE SKY IT SELDOM OR NEVER RAINS THERE IN THE SUMMER
TIME
I KNOW A MAN WHO WENT THERE TO DIE
BUT HE MADE A FAILURE OF IT
HE WAS A SKELETON WHEN HE CAME AND COULD BARELY STAND
HE HAD NO
APPETITE AND DID NOTHING BUT READ TRACTS AND REFLECT ON THE FUTURE
THREE MONTHS LATER HE WAS SLEEPING OUT OF DOORS REGULARLY EATING ALL HE
COULD HOLD THREE TIMES A DAY AND CHASING GAME OVER MOUNTAINS THREE
THOUSAND FEET HIGH FOR RECREATION
AND HE WAS A SKELETON NO LONGER BUT
WEIGHED PART OF A TON
THIS IS NO FANCY SKETCH BUT THE TRUTH
HIS
DISEASE WAS CONSUMPTION
I CONFIDENTLY COMMEND HIS EXPERIENCE TO OTHER
SKELETONS
I SUPERINTENDED AGAIN AND AS SOON AS WE HAD EATEN BREAKFAST WE GOT IN
THE BOAT AND SKIRTED ALONG THE LAKE SHORE ABOUT THREE MILES AND
DISEMBARKED
WE LIKED THE APPEARANCE OF THE PLACE AND SO WE CLAIMED
SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF IT AND STUCK OUR NOTICES ON A TREE
IT WAS
YELLOW PINE TIMBER LAND A DENSE FOREST OF TREES A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND
FROM ONE TO FIVE FEET THROUGH AT THE BUTT
IT WAS NECESSARY TO FENCE OUR
PROPERTY OR WE COULD NOT HOLD IT
THAT IS TO SAY IT WAS NECESSARY TO
CUT DOWN TREES HERE AND THERE AND MAKE THEM FALL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO FORM
A SORT OF ENCLOSURE WITH PRETTY WIDE GAPS IN IT
WE CUT DOWN THREE
TREES APIECE AND FOUND IT SUCH HEART BREAKING WORK THAT WE DECIDED TO
REST OUR CASE ON THOSE IF THEY HELD THE PROPERTY WELL AND GOOD IF
THEY DIDN'T LET THE PROPERTY SPILL OUT THROUGH THE GAPS AND GO IT WAS
NO USE TO WORK OURSELVES TO DEATH MERELY TO SAVE A FEW ACRES OF LAND
NEXT DAY WE CAME BACK TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR A HOUSE WAS ALSO NECESSARY
IN ORDER TO HOLD THE PROPERTY
WE DECIDED TO BUILD A SUBSTANTIAL
LOG HOUSE AND EXCITE THE ENVY OF THE BRIGADE BOYS BUT BY THE TIME WE HAD
CUT AND TRIMMED THE FIRST LOG IT SEEMED UNNECESSARY TO BE SO ELABORATE
AND SO WE CONCLUDED TO BUILD IT OF SAPLINGS
HOWEVER TWO SAPLINGS DULY
CUT AND TRIMMED COMPELLED RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT A STILL MODESTER
ARCHITECTURE WOULD SATISFY THE LAW AND SO WE CONCLUDED TO BUILD A
BRUSH HOUSE
WE DEVOTED THE NEXT DAY TO THIS WORK BUT WE DID SO MUCH
SITTING AROUND AND DISCUSSING THAT BY THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WE
HAD ACHIEVED ONLY A HALF WAY SORT OF AFFAIR WHICH ONE OF US HAD TO WATCH
WHILE THE OTHER CUT BRUSH LEST IF BOTH TURNED OUR BACKS WE MIGHT NOT BE
ABLE TO FIND IT AGAIN IT HAD SUCH A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE TO THE
SURROUNDING VEGETATION
BUT WE WERE SATISFIED WITH IT
WE WERE LAND OWNERS NOW DULY SEIZED AND POSSESSED AND WITHIN THE
PROTECTION OF THE LAW
THEREFORE WE DECIDED TO TAKE UP OUR RESIDENCE ON
OUR OWN DOMAIN AND ENJOY THAT LARGE SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH ONLY SUCH
AN EXPERIENCE CAN BRING
LATE THE NEXT AFTERNOON AFTER A GOOD LONG
REST WE SAILED AWAY FROM THE BRIGADE CAMP WITH ALL THE PROVISIONS AND
COOKING UTENSILS WE COULD CARRY OFF BORROW IS THE MORE ACCURATE WORD
AND JUST AS THE NIGHT WAS FALLING WE BEACHED THE BOAT AT OUR OWN LANDING
CHAPTER XXIII
IF THERE IS ANY LIFE THAT IS HAPPIER THAN THE LIFE WE LED ON OUR TIMBER
RANCH FOR THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS IT MUST BE A SORT OF LIFE WHICH I
HAVE NOT READ OF IN BOOKS OR EXPERIENCED IN PERSON
WE DID NOT SEE A
HUMAN BEING BUT OURSELVES DURING THE TIME OR HEAR ANY SOUNDS BUT THOSE
THAT WERE MADE BY THE WIND AND THE WAVES THE SIGHING OF THE PINES AND
NOW AND THEN THE FAR OFF THUNDER OF AN AVALANCHE
THE FOREST ABOUT US
WAS DENSE AND COOL THE SKY ABOVE US WAS CLOUDLESS AND BRILLIANT WITH
SUNSHINE THE BROAD LAKE BEFORE US WAS GLASSY AND CLEAR OR RIPPLED AND
BREEZY OR BLACK AND STORM TOSSED ACCORDING TO NATURE'S MOOD AND ITS
CIRCLING BORDER OF MOUNTAIN DOMES CLOTHED WITH FORESTS SCARRED WITH
LAND SLIDES CLOVEN BY CANONS AND VALLEYS AND HELMETED WITH GLITTERING
SNOW FITLY FRAMED AND FINISHED THE NOBLE PICTURE
THE VIEW WAS ALWAYS
FASCINATING BEWITCHING ENTRANCING
THE EYE WAS NEVER TIRED OF GAZING
NIGHT OR DAY IN CALM OR STORM IT SUFFERED BUT ONE GRIEF AND THAT WAS
THAT IT COULD NOT LOOK ALWAYS BUT MUST CLOSE SOMETIMES IN SLEEP
WE SLEPT IN THE SAND CLOSE TO THE WATER'S EDGE BETWEEN TWO PROTECTING
BOULDERS WHICH TOOK CARE OF THE STORMY NIGHT WINDS FOR US
WE NEVER
TOOK ANY PAREGORIC TO MAKE US SLEEP
AT THE FIRST BREAK OF DAWN WE WERE
ALWAYS UP AND RUNNING FOOT RACES TO TONE DOWN EXCESS OF PHYSICAL VIGOR
AND EXUBERANCE OF SPIRITS
THAT IS JOHNNY WAS BUT I HELD HIS HAT
WHILE SMOKING THE PIPE OF PEACE AFTER BREAKFAST WE WATCHED THE SENTINEL
PEAKS PUT ON THE GLORY OF THE SUN AND FOLLOWED THE CONQUERING LIGHT AS
IT SWEPT DOWN AMONG THE SHADOWS AND SET THE CAPTIVE CRAGS AND FORESTS
FREE
WE WATCHED THE TINTED PICTURES GROW AND BRIGHTEN UPON THE WATER
TILL EVERY LITTLE DETAIL OF FOREST PRECIPICE AND PINNACLE WAS WROUGHT IN
AND FINISHED AND THE MIRACLE OF THE ENCHANTER COMPLETE
THEN TO
BUSINESS
THAT IS DRIFTING AROUND IN THE BOAT
WE WERE ON THE NORTH SHORE
THERE THE ROCKS ON THE BOTTOM ARE SOMETIMES GRAY SOMETIMES WHITE
THIS GIVES THE MARVELOUS TRANSPARENCY OF THE WATER A FULLER ADVANTAGE
THAN IT HAS ELSEWHERE ON THE LAKE
WE USUALLY PUSHED OUT A HUNDRED YARDS
OR SO FROM SHORE AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE THWARTS IN THE SUN AND LET
THE BOAT DRIFT BY THE HOUR WHITHER IT WOULD
WE SELDOM TALKED
IT INTERRUPTED THE SABBATH STILLNESS AND MARRED THE DREAMS THE LUXURIOUS
REST AND INDOLENCE BROUGHT
THE SHORE ALL ALONG WAS INDENTED WITH DEEP
CURVED BAYS AND COVES BORDERED BY NARROW SAND BEACHES AND WHERE THE
SAND ENDED THE STEEP MOUNTAIN SIDES ROSE RIGHT UP ALOFT INTO SPACE ROSE
UP LIKE A VAST WALL A LITTLE OUT OF THE PERPENDICULAR AND THICKLY WOODED
WITH TALL PINES
SO SINGULARLY CLEAR WAS THE WATER THAT WHERE IT WAS ONLY TWENTY OR
THIRTY FEET DEEP THE BOTTOM WAS SO PERFECTLY DISTINCT THAT THE BOAT
SEEMED FLOATING IN THE AIR YES WHERE IT WAS EVEN EIGHTY FEET DEEP
EVERY LITTLE PEBBLE WAS DISTINCT EVERY SPECKLED TROUT EVERY
HAND'S BREADTH OF SAND
OFTEN AS WE LAY ON OUR FACES A GRANITE
BOULDER AS LARGE AS A VILLAGE CHURCH WOULD START OUT OF THE BOTTOM
APPARENTLY AND SEEM CLIMBING UP RAPIDLY TO THE SURFACE TILL PRESENTLY
IT THREATENED TO TOUCH OUR FACES AND WE COULD NOT RESIST THE IMPULSE TO
SEIZE AN OAR AND AVERT THE DANGER
BUT THE BOAT WOULD FLOAT ON AND THE
BOULDER DESCEND AGAIN AND THEN WE COULD SEE THAT WHEN WE HAD BEEN
EXACTLY ABOVE IT IT MUST STILL HAVE BEEN TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET BELOW THE
SURFACE
DOWN THROUGH THE TRANSPARENCY OF THESE GREAT DEPTHS THE WATER
WAS NOT MERELY TRANSPARENT BUT DAZZLINGLY BRILLIANTLY SO
ALL OBJECTS
SEEN THROUGH IT HAD A BRIGHT STRONG VIVIDNESS NOT ONLY OF OUTLINE BUT
OF EVERY MINUTE DETAIL WHICH THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD WHEN SEEN SIMPLY
THROUGH THE SAME DEPTH OF ATMOSPHERE
SO EMPTY AND AIRY DID ALL SPACES
SEEM BELOW US AND SO STRONG WAS THE SENSE OF FLOATING HIGH ALOFT IN
MID NOTHINGNESS THAT WE CALLED THESE BOAT EXCURSIONS BALLOON VOYAGES
WE FISHED A GOOD DEAL BUT WE DID NOT AVERAGE ONE FISH A WEEK
WE COULD
SEE TROUT BY THE THOUSAND WINGING ABOUT IN THE EMPTINESS UNDER US OR
SLEEPING IN SHOALS ON THE BOTTOM BUT THEY WOULD NOT BITE THEY COULD SEE
THE LINE TOO PLAINLY PERHAPS
WE FREQUENTLY SELECTED THE TROUT WE
WANTED AND RESTED THE BAIT PATIENTLY AND PERSISTENTLY ON THE END OF HIS
NOSE AT A DEPTH OF EIGHTY FEET BUT HE WOULD ONLY SHAKE IT OFF WITH AN
ANNOYED MANNER AND SHIFT HIS POSITION
WE BATHED OCCASIONALLY BUT THE WATER WAS RATHER CHILLY FOR ALL IT
LOOKED SO SUNNY
SOMETIMES WE ROWED OUT TO THE BLUE WATER A MILE OR
TWO FROM SHORE
IT WAS AS DEAD BLUE AS INDIGO THERE BECAUSE OF THE
IMMENSE DEPTH
BY OFFICIAL MEASUREMENT THE LAKE IN ITS CENTRE IS ONE
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET DEEP
SOMETIMES ON LAZY AFTERNOONS WE LOLLED ON THE SAND IN CAMP AND SMOKED
PIPES AND READ SOME OLD WELL WORN NOVELS
AT NIGHT BY THE CAMP FIRE WE
PLAYED EUCHRE AND SEVEN UP TO STRENGTHEN THE MIND AND PLAYED THEM WITH
CARDS SO GREASY AND DEFACED THAT ONLY A WHOLE SUMMER'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH
THEM COULD ENABLE THE STUDENT TO TELL THE ACE OF CLUBS FROM THE JACK OF
DIAMONDS
WE NEVER SLEPT IN OUR HOUSE IT NEVER RECURRED TO US FOR ONE THING
AND BESIDES IT WAS BUILT TO HOLD THE GROUND AND THAT WAS ENOUGH
WE
DID NOT WISH TO STRAIN IT
BY AND BY OUR PROVISIONS BEGAN TO RUN SHORT AND WE WENT BACK TO THE OLD
CAMP AND LAID IN A NEW SUPPLY
WE WERE GONE ALL DAY AND REACHED HOME
AGAIN ABOUT NIGHT FALL PRETTY TIRED AND HUNGRY
WHILE JOHNNY WAS
CARRYING THE MAIN BULK OF THE PROVISIONS UP TO OUR HOUSE FOR FUTURE
USE I TOOK THE LOAF OF BREAD SOME SLICES OF BACON AND THE COFFEE POT
ASHORE SET THEM DOWN BY A TREE LIT A FIRE AND WENT BACK TO THE BOAT TO
GET THE FRYING PAN
WHILE I WAS AT THIS I HEARD A SHOUT FROM JOHNNY
AND LOOKING UP I SAW THAT MY FIRE WAS GALLOPING ALL OVER THE PREMISES
JOHNNY WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
HE HAD TO RUN THROUGH THE FLAMES TO
GET TO THE LAKE SHORE AND THEN WE STOOD HELPLESS AND WATCHED THE
DEVASTATION
THE GROUND WAS DEEPLY CARPETED WITH DRY PINE NEEDLES AND THE FIRE
TOUCHED THEM OFF AS IF THEY WERE GUNPOWDER
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE WITH
WHAT FIERCE SPEED THE TALL SHEET OF FLAME TRAVELED MY COFFEE POT WAS
GONE AND EVERYTHING WITH IT
IN A MINUTE AND A HALF THE FIRE SEIZED
UPON A DENSE GROWTH OF DRY MANZANITA CHAPPARAL SIX OR EIGHT FEET HIGH
AND THEN THE ROARING AND POPPING AND CRACKLING WAS SOMETHING TERRIFIC
WE WERE DRIVEN TO THE BOAT BY THE INTENSE HEAT AND THERE WE REMAINED
SPELL BOUND
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR ALL BEFORE US WAS A TOSSING BLINDING TEMPEST OF
FLAME IT WENT SURGING UP ADJACENT RIDGES SURMOUNTED THEM AND
DISAPPEARED IN THE CANONS BEYOND BURST INTO VIEW UPON HIGHER AND FARTHER
RIDGES PRESENTLY SHED A GRANDER ILLUMINATION ABROAD AND DOVE AGAIN
FLAMED OUT AGAIN DIRECTLY HIGHER AND STILL HIGHER UP THE
MOUNTAIN SIDE THREW OUT SKIRMISHING PARTIES OF FIRE HERE AND THERE AND
SENT THEM TRAILING THEIR CRIMSON SPIRALS AWAY AMONG REMOTE RAMPARTS AND
RIBS AND GORGES TILL AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH THE LOFTY
MOUNTAIN FRONTS WERE WEBBED AS IT WERE WITH A TANGLED NETWORK OF RED LAVA
STREAMS
AWAY ACROSS THE WATER THE CRAGS AND DOMES WERE LIT WITH A RUDDY
GLARE AND THE FIRMAMENT ABOVE WAS A REFLECTED HELL
EVERY FEATURE OF THE SPECTACLE WAS REPEATED IN THE GLOWING MIRROR OF THE
LAKE BOTH PICTURES WERE SUBLIME BOTH WERE BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT IN THE
LAKE HAD A BEWILDERING RICHNESS ABOUT IT THAT ENCHANTED THE EYE AND HELD
IT WITH THE STRONGER FASCINATION
WE SAT ABSORBED AND MOTIONLESS THROUGH FOUR LONG HOURS
WE NEVER THOUGHT
OF SUPPER AND NEVER FELT FATIGUE
BUT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE
CONFLAGRATION HAD TRAVELED BEYOND OUR RANGE OF VISION AND THEN DARKNESS
STOLE DOWN UPON THE LANDSCAPE AGAIN
HUNGER ASSERTED ITSELF NOW BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO EAT
THE PROVISIONS
WERE ALL COOKED NO DOUBT BUT WE DID NOT GO TO SEE
WE WERE HOMELESS
WANDERERS AGAIN WITHOUT ANY PROPERTY
OUR FENCE WAS GONE OUR HOUSE
BURNED DOWN NO INSURANCE
OUR PINE FOREST WAS WELL SCORCHED THE DEAD
TREES ALL BURNED UP AND OUR BROAD ACRES OF MANZANITA SWEPT AWAY
OUR
BLANKETS WERE ON OUR USUAL SAND BED HOWEVER AND SO WE LAY DOWN AND WENT
TO SLEEP
THE NEXT MORNING WE STARTED BACK TO THE OLD CAMP BUT WHILE
OUT A LONG WAY FROM SHORE SO GREAT A STORM CAME UP THAT WE DARED NOT TRY
TO LAND
SO I BALED OUT THE SEAS WE SHIPPED AND JOHNNY PULLED HEAVILY
THROUGH THE BILLOWS TILL WE HAD REACHED A POINT THREE OR FOUR MILES
BEYOND THE CAMP
THE STORM WAS INCREASING AND IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT IT
WAS BETTER TO TAKE THE HAZARD OF BEACHING THE BOAT THAN GO DOWN IN A
HUNDRED FATHOMS OF WATER SO WE RAN IN WITH TALL WHITE CAPS FOLLOWING
AND I SAT DOWN IN THE STERN SHEETS AND POINTED HER HEAD ON TO THE SHORE
THE INSTANT THE BOW STRUCK A WAVE CAME OVER THE STERN THAT WASHED CREW
AND CARGO ASHORE AND SAVED A DEAL OF TROUBLE
WE SHIVERED IN THE LEE OF
A BOULDER ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND FROZE ALL THE NIGHT THROUGH
IN
THE MORNING THE TEMPEST HAD GONE DOWN AND WE PADDLED DOWN TO THE CAMP
WITHOUT ANY UNNECESSARY DELAY
WE WERE SO STARVED THAT WE ATE UP THE
REST OF THE BRIGADE'S PROVISIONS AND THEN SET OUT TO CARSON TO TELL THEM
ABOUT IT AND ASK THEIR FORGIVENESS
IT WAS ACCORDED UPON PAYMENT OF
DAMAGES
WE MADE MANY TRIPS TO THE LAKE AFTER THAT AND HAD MANY A HAIR BREADTH
ESCAPE AND BLOOD CURDLING ADVENTURE WHICH WILL NEVER BE RECORDED IN ANY
HISTORY
CHAPTER XXIV
I RESOLVED TO HAVE A HORSE TO RIDE
I HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH WILD FREE
MAGNIFICENT HORSEMANSHIP OUTSIDE OF A CIRCUS AS THESE PICTURESQUELY CLAD
MEXICANS CALIFORNIANS AND MEXICANIZED AMERICANS DISPLAYED IN CARSON
STREETS EVERY DAY
HOW THEY RODE LEANING JUST GENTLY FORWARD OUT OF
THE PERPENDICULAR EASY AND NONCHALANT WITH BROAD SLOUCH HAT BRIM BLOWN
SQUARE UP IN FRONT AND LONG RIATA SWINGING ABOVE THE HEAD THEY SWEPT
THROUGH THE TOWN LIKE THE WIND THE NEXT MINUTE THEY WERE ONLY A SAILING
PUFF OF DUST ON THE FAR DESERT
IF THEY TROTTED THEY SAT UP GALLANTLY
AND GRACEFULLY AND SEEMED PART OF THE HORSE DID NOT GO JIGGERING UP AND
DOWN AFTER THE SILLY MISS NANCY FASHION OF THE RIDING SCHOOLS
I HAD
QUICKLY LEARNED TO TELL A HORSE FROM A COW AND WAS FULL OF ANXIETY TO
LEARN MORE
I WAS RESOLVED TO BUY A HORSE
WHILE THE THOUGHT WAS RANKLING IN MY MIND THE AUCTIONEER CAME SKURRYING
THROUGH THE PLAZA ON A BLACK BEAST THAT HAD AS MANY HUMPS AND CORNERS ON
HIM AS A DROMEDARY AND WAS NECESSARILY UNCOMELY BUT HE WAS GOING
GOING AT TWENTY TWO HORSE SADDLE AND BRIDLE AT TWENTY TWO DOLLARS
GENTLEMEN AND I COULD HARDLY RESIST
A MAN WHOM I DID NOT KNOW HE TURNED OUT TO BE THE AUCTIONEER'S BROTHER
NOTICED THE WISTFUL LOOK IN MY EYE AND OBSERVED THAT THAT WAS A VERY
REMARKABLE HORSE TO BE GOING AT SUCH A PRICE AND ADDED THAT THE SADDLE
ALONE WAS WORTH THE MONEY
IT WAS A SPANISH SADDLE WITH PONDEROUS
'TAPIDAROS' AND FURNISHED WITH THE UNGAINLY SOLE LEATHER COVERING WITH
THE UNSPELLABLE NAME
I SAID I HAD HALF A NOTION TO BID
THEN THIS
KEEN EYED PERSON APPEARED TO ME TO BE TAKING MY MEASURE BUT I
DISMISSED THE SUSPICION WHEN HE SPOKE FOR HIS MANNER WAS FULL OF
GUILELESS CANDOR AND TRUTHFULNESS
SAID HE
I KNOW THAT HORSE KNOW HIM WELL
YOU ARE A STRANGER I TAKE IT AND SO
YOU MIGHT THINK HE WAS AN AMERICAN HORSE MAYBE BUT I ASSURE YOU HE IS
NOT
HE IS NOTHING OF THE KIND BUT EXCUSE MY SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE
OTHER PEOPLE BEING NEAR HE IS WITHOUT THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT A GENUINE
MEXICAN PLUG
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT A GENUINE MEXICAN PLUG WAS BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS MAN'S WAY OF SAYING IT THAT MADE ME SWEAR INWARDLY THAT I
WOULD OWN A GENUINE MEXICAN PLUG OR DIE
HAS HE ANY OTHER ER ADVANTAGES I INQUIRED SUPPRESSING WHAT
EAGERNESS I COULD
HE HOOKED HIS FOREFINGER IN THE POCKET OF MY ARMY SHIRT LED ME TO ONE
SIDE AND BREATHED IN MY EAR IMPRESSIVELY THESE WORDS
HE CAN OUT BUCK ANYTHING IN AMERICA
GOING GOING GOING AT TWENT TY FOUR DOLLARS AND A HALF GEN
TWENTY SEVEN I SHOUTED IN A FRENZY
AND SOLD SAID THE AUCTIONEER AND PASSED OVER THE GENUINE MEXICAN PLUG
TO ME
I COULD SCARCELY CONTAIN MY EXULTATION
I PAID THE MONEY AND PUT THE
ANIMAL IN A NEIGHBORING LIVERY STABLE TO DINE AND REST HIMSELF
IN THE AFTERNOON I BROUGHT THE CREATURE INTO THE PLAZA AND CERTAIN
CITIZENS HELD HIM BY THE HEAD AND OTHERS BY THE TAIL WHILE I MOUNTED
HIM
AS SOON AS THEY LET GO HE PLACED ALL HIS FEET IN A BUNCH TOGETHER
LOWERED HIS BACK AND THEN SUDDENLY ARCHED IT UPWARD AND SHOT ME
STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR A MATTER OF THREE OR FOUR FEET I CAME AS STRAIGHT
DOWN AGAIN LIT IN THE SADDLE WENT INSTANTLY UP AGAIN CAME DOWN ALMOST
ON THE HIGH POMMEL SHOT UP AGAIN AND CAME DOWN ON THE HORSE'S NECK ALL
IN THE SPACE OF THREE OR FOUR SECONDS
THEN HE ROSE AND STOOD ALMOST
STRAIGHT UP ON HIS HIND FEET AND I CLASPING HIS LEAN NECK DESPERATELY
SLID BACK INTO THE SADDLE AND HELD ON
HE CAME DOWN AND IMMEDIATELY
HOISTED HIS HEELS INTO THE AIR DELIVERING A VICIOUS KICK AT THE SKY AND
STOOD ON HIS FOREFEET
AND THEN DOWN HE CAME ONCE MORE AND BEGAN THE
ORIGINAL EXERCISE OF SHOOTING ME STRAIGHT UP AGAIN
THE THIRD TIME I
WENT UP I HEARD A STRANGER SAY
OH DON'T HE BUCK THOUGH
WHILE I WAS UP SOMEBODY STRUCK THE HORSE A SOUNDING THWACK WITH A
LEATHERN STRAP AND WHEN I ARRIVED AGAIN THE GENUINE MEXICAN PLUG WAS NOT
THERE
A CALIFORNIA YOUTH CHASED HIM UP AND CAUGHT HIM AND ASKED IF HE
MIGHT HAVE A RIDE
I GRANTED HIM THAT LUXURY
HE MOUNTED THE GENUINE
GOT LIFTED INTO THE AIR ONCE BUT SENT HIS SPURS HOME AS HE DESCENDED
AND THE HORSE DARTED AWAY LIKE A TELEGRAM
HE SOARED OVER THREE FENCES
LIKE A BIRD AND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD THE WASHOE VALLEY
I SAT DOWN ON A STONE WITH A SIGH AND BY A NATURAL IMPULSE ONE OF MY
HANDS SOUGHT MY FOREHEAD AND THE OTHER THE BASE OF MY STOMACH
I
BELIEVE I NEVER APPRECIATED TILL THEN THE POVERTY OF THE HUMAN
MACHINERY FOR I STILL NEEDED A HAND OR TWO TO PLACE ELSEWHERE
PEN
CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW I WAS JOLTED UP
IMAGINATION CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW
DISJOINTED I WAS HOW INTERNALLY EXTERNALLY AND UNIVERSALLY I WAS
UNSETTLED MIXED UP AND RUPTURED
THERE WAS A SYMPATHETIC CROWD AROUND
ME THOUGH
ONE ELDERLY LOOKING COMFORTER SAID
STRANGER YOU'VE BEEN TAKEN IN
EVERYBODY IN THIS CAMP KNOWS THAT
HORSE
ANY CHILD ANY INJUN COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT HE'D BUCK HE IS
THE VERY WORST DEVIL TO BUCK ON THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA
YOU HEAR ME
I'M CURRY
OLD CURRY
OLD ABE CURRY
AND MOREOVER HE IS A SIMON PURE
OUT AND OUT GENUINE D D MEXICAN PLUG AND AN UNCOMMON MEAN ONE AT THAT
TOO
WHY YOU TURNIP IF YOU HAD LAID LOW AND KEPT DARK THERE'S CHANCES
TO BUY AN AMERICAN HORSE FOR MIGHTY LITTLE MORE THAN YOU PAID FOR THAT
BLOODY OLD FOREIGN RELIC
I GAVE NO SIGN BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF THE AUCTIONEER'S BROTHER'S
FUNERAL TOOK PLACE WHILE I WAS IN THE TERRITORY I WOULD POSTPONE ALL
OTHER RECREATIONS AND ATTEND IT
AFTER A GALLOP OF SIXTEEN MILES THE CALIFORNIAN YOUTH AND THE GENUINE
MEXICAN PLUG CAME TEARING INTO TOWN AGAIN SHEDDING FOAM FLAKES LIKE THE
SPUME SPRAY THAT DRIVES BEFORE A TYPHOON AND WITH ONE FINAL SKIP OVER A
WHEELBARROW AND A CHINAMAN CAST ANCHOR IN FRONT OF THE RANCH
SUCH PANTING AND BLOWING SUCH SPREADING AND CONTRACTING OF THE RED
EQUINE NOSTRILS AND GLARING OF THE WILD EQUINE EYE BUT WAS THE
IMPERIAL BEAST SUBJUGATED INDEED HE WAS NOT
HIS LORDSHIP THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE THOUGHT HE WAS AND MOUNTED HIM TO
GO DOWN TO THE CAPITOL BUT THE FIRST DASH THE CREATURE MADE WAS OVER A
PILE OF TELEGRAPH POLES HALF AS HIGH AS A CHURCH AND HIS TIME TO THE
CAPITOL ONE MILE AND THREE QUARTERS REMAINS UNBEATEN TO THIS DAY
BUT
THEN HE TOOK AN ADVANTAGE HE LEFT OUT THE MILE AND ONLY DID THE THREE
QUARTERS
THAT IS TO SAY HE MADE A STRAIGHT CUT ACROSS LOTS PREFERRING
FENCES AND DITCHES TO A CROOKED ROAD AND WHEN THE SPEAKER GOT TO THE
CAPITOL HE SAID HE HAD BEEN IN THE AIR SO MUCH HE FELT AS IF HE HAD MADE
THE TRIP ON A COMET
IN THE EVENING THE SPEAKER CAME HOME AFOOT FOR EXERCISE AND GOT THE
GENUINE TOWED BACK BEHIND A QUARTZ WAGON
THE NEXT DAY I LOANED THE
ANIMAL TO THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE TO GO DOWN TO THE DANA SILVER MINE SIX
MILES AND HE WALKED BACK FOR EXERCISE AND GOT THE HORSE TOWED
EVERYBODY I LOANED HIM TO ALWAYS WALKED BACK THEY NEVER COULD GET ENOUGH
EXERCISE ANY OTHER WAY
STILL I CONTINUED TO LOAN HIM TO ANYBODY WHO WAS WILLING TO BORROW HIM
MY IDEA BEING TO GET HIM CRIPPLED AND THROW HIM ON THE BORROWER'S HANDS
OR KILLED AND MAKE THE BORROWER PAY FOR HIM
BUT SOMEHOW NOTHING EVER
HAPPENED TO HIM
HE TOOK CHANCES THAT NO OTHER HORSE EVER TOOK AND
SURVIVED BUT HE ALWAYS CAME OUT SAFE
IT WAS HIS DAILY HABIT TO TRY
EXPERIMENTS THAT HAD ALWAYS BEFORE BEEN CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE BUT HE
ALWAYS GOT THROUGH
SOMETIMES HE MISCALCULATED A LITTLE AND DID NOT GET
HIS RIDER THROUGH INTACT BUT HE ALWAYS GOT THROUGH HIMSELF
OF COURSE I
HAD TRIED TO SELL HIM BUT THAT WAS A STRETCH OF SIMPLICITY WHICH MET
WITH LITTLE SYMPATHY
THE AUCTIONEER STORMED UP AND DOWN THE STREETS ON
HIM FOR FOUR DAYS DISPERSING THE POPULACE INTERRUPTING BUSINESS AND
DESTROYING CHILDREN AND NEVER GOT A BID AT LEAST NEVER ANY BUT THE
EIGHTEEN DOLLAR ONE HE HIRED A NOTORIOUSLY SUBSTANCELESS BUMMER TO MAKE
THE PEOPLE ONLY SMILED PLEASANTLY AND RESTRAINED THEIR DESIRE TO BUY IF
THEY HAD ANY
THEN THE AUCTIONEER BROUGHT IN HIS BILL AND I WITHDREW
THE HORSE FROM THE MARKET
WE TRIED TO TRADE HIM OFF AT PRIVATE VENDUE
NEXT OFFERING HIM AT A SACRIFICE FOR SECOND HAND TOMBSTONES OLD IRON
TEMPERANCE TRACTS ANY KIND OF PROPERTY
BUT HOLDERS WERE STIFF AND WE
RETIRED FROM THE MARKET AGAIN
I NEVER TRIED TO RIDE THE HORSE ANY MORE
WALKING WAS GOOD ENOUGH EXERCISE FOR A MAN LIKE ME THAT HAD NOTHING THE
MATTER WITH HIM EXCEPT RUPTURES INTERNAL INJURIES AND SUCH THINGS
FINALLY I TRIED TO GIVE HIM AWAY
BUT IT WAS A FAILURE
PARTIES SAID
EARTHQUAKES WERE HANDY ENOUGH ON THE PACIFIC COAST THEY DID NOT WISH TO
OWN ONE
AS A LAST RESORT I OFFERED HIM TO THE GOVERNOR FOR THE USE OF
THE BRIGADE HIS FACE LIT UP EAGERLY AT FIRST BUT TONED DOWN AGAIN
AND HE SAID THE THING WOULD BE TOO PALPABLE
JUST THEN THE LIVERY STABLE MAN BROUGHT IN HIS BILL FOR SIX WEEKS'
KEEPING STALL ROOM FOR THE HORSE FIFTEEN DOLLARS HAY FOR THE HORSE
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THE GENUINE MEXICAN PLUG HAD EATEN A TON OF THE
ARTICLE AND THE MAN SAID HE WOULD HAVE EATEN A HUNDRED IF HE HAD LET
HIM
I WILL REMARK HERE IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THAT THE REGULAR PRICE OF HAY
DURING THAT YEAR AND A PART OF THE NEXT WAS REALLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
DOLLARS A TON
DURING A PART OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR IT HAD SOLD AT FIVE
HUNDRED A TON IN GOLD AND DURING THE WINTER BEFORE THAT THERE WAS SUCH
SCARCITY OF THE ARTICLE THAT IN SEVERAL INSTANCES SMALL QUANTITIES HAD
BROUGHT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A TON IN COIN THE CONSEQUENCE MIGHT BE
GUESSED WITHOUT MY TELLING IT PEOPLED TURNED THEIR STOCK LOOSE TO
STARVE AND BEFORE THE SPRING ARRIVED CARSON AND EAGLE VALLEYS WERE
ALMOST LITERALLY CARPETED WITH THEIR CARCASES ANY OLD SETTLER THERE
WILL VERIFY THESE STATEMENTS
I MANAGED TO PAY THE LIVERY BILL AND THAT SAME DAY I GAVE THE GENUINE
MEXICAN PLUG TO A PASSING ARKANSAS EMIGRANT WHOM FORTUNE DELIVERED INTO
MY HAND
IF THIS EVER MEETS HIS EYE HE WILL DOUBTLESS REMEMBER THE
DONATION
NOW WHOEVER HAS HAD THE LUCK TO RIDE A REAL MEXICAN PLUG WILL RECOGNIZE
THE ANIMAL DEPICTED IN THIS CHAPTER AND HARDLY CONSIDER HIM EXAGGERATED
BUT THE UNINITIATED WILL FEEL JUSTIFIED IN REGARDING HIS PORTRAIT AS A
FANCY SKETCH PERHAPS
CHAPTER XXV
ORIGINALLY NEVADA WAS A PART OF UTAH AND WAS CALLED CARSON COUNTY AND A
PRETTY LARGE COUNTY IT WAS TOO
CERTAIN OF ITS VALLEYS PRODUCED NO END
OF HAY AND THIS ATTRACTED SMALL COLONIES OF MORMON STOCK RAISERS AND
FARMERS TO THEM
A FEW ORTHODOX AMERICANS STRAGGLED IN FROM CALIFORNIA
BUT NO LOVE WAS LOST BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES OF COLONISTS
THERE WAS
LITTLE OR NO FRIENDLY INTERCOURSE EACH PARTY STAID TO ITSELF
THE
MORMONS WERE LARGELY IN THE MAJORITY AND HAD THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF
BEING PECULIARLY UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE MORMON GOVERNMENT OF THE
TERRITORY
THEREFORE THEY COULD AFFORD TO BE DISTANT AND EVEN
PEREMPTORY TOWARD THEIR NEIGHBORS
ONE OF THE TRADITIONS OF CARSON
VALLEY ILLUSTRATES THE CONDITION OF THINGS THAT PREVAILED AT THE TIME I
SPEAK OF
THE HIRED GIRL OF ONE OF THE AMERICAN FAMILIES WAS IRISH AND
A CATHOLIC YET IT WAS NOTED WITH SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY PERSON
OUTSIDE OF THE MORMON RING WHO COULD GET FAVORS FROM THE MORMONS
SHE
ASKED KINDNESSES OF THEM OFTEN AND ALWAYS GOT THEM
IT WAS A MYSTERY TO
EVERYBODY
BUT ONE DAY AS SHE WAS PASSING OUT AT THE DOOR A LARGE BOWIE
KNIFE DROPPED FROM UNDER HER APRON AND WHEN HER MISTRESS ASKED FOR AN
EXPLANATION SHE OBSERVED THAT SHE WAS GOING OUT TO BORRY A WASH TUB FROM
THE MORMONS
IN 1858 SILVER LODES WERE DISCOVERED IN CARSON COUNTY AND THEN THE
ASPECT OF THINGS CHANGED
CALIFORNIANS BEGAN TO FLOCK IN AND THE
AMERICAN ELEMENT WAS SOON IN THE MAJORITY
ALLEGIANCE TO BRIGHAM YOUNG
AND UTAH WAS RENOUNCED AND A TEMPORARY TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT FOR
WASHOE WAS INSTITUTED BY THE CITIZENS
GOVERNOR ROOP WAS THE FIRST AND
ONLY CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF IT
IN DUE COURSE OF TIME CONGRESS PASSED A
BILL TO ORGANIZE NEVADA TERRITORY AND PRESIDENT LINCOLN SENT OUT
GOVERNOR NYE TO SUPPLANT ROOP
AT THIS TIME THE POPULATION OF THE TERRITORY WAS ABOUT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN
THOUSAND AND RAPIDLY INCREASING
SILVER MINES WERE BEING VIGOROUSLY
DEVELOPED AND SILVER MILLS ERECTED
BUSINESS OF ALL KINDS WAS ACTIVE AND
PROSPEROUS AND GROWING MORE SO DAY BY DAY
THE PEOPLE WERE GLAD TO HAVE A LEGITIMATELY CONSTITUTED GOVERNMENT BUT
DID NOT PARTICULARLY ENJOY HAVING STRANGERS FROM DISTANT STATES PUT IN
AUTHORITY OVER THEM A SENTIMENT THAT WAS NATURAL ENOUGH
THEY THOUGHT
THE OFFICIALS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FROM AMONG THEMSELVES FROM AMONG
PROMINENT CITIZENS WHO HAD EARNED A RIGHT TO SUCH PROMOTION AND WHO
WOULD BE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE POPULACE AND LIKEWISE THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED
WITH THE NEEDS OF THE TERRITORY
THEY WERE RIGHT IN VIEWING THE MATTER
THUS WITHOUT DOUBT
THE NEW OFFICERS WERE EMIGRANTS AND THAT WAS NO
TITLE TO ANYBODY'S AFFECTION OR ADMIRATION EITHER
THE NEW GOVERNMENT WAS RECEIVED WITH CONSIDERABLE COOLNESS
IT WAS NOT
ONLY A FOREIGN INTRUDER BUT A POOR ONE
IT WAS NOT EVEN WORTH PLUCKING
EXCEPT BY THE SMALLEST OF SMALL FRY OFFICE SEEKERS AND SUCH
EVERYBODY
KNEW THAT CONGRESS HAD APPROPRIATED ONLY TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
IN GREENBACKS FOR ITS SUPPORT ABOUT MONEY ENOUGH TO RUN A QUARTZ MILL A
MONTH
AND EVERYBODY KNEW ALSO THAT THE FIRST YEAR'S MONEY WAS STILL
IN WASHINGTON AND THAT THE GETTING HOLD OF IT WOULD BE A TEDIOUS AND
DIFFICULT PROCESS
CARSON CITY WAS TOO WARY AND TOO WISE TO OPEN UP A
CREDIT ACCOUNT WITH THE IMPORTED BANTLING WITH ANYTHING LIKE INDECENT
HASTE
THERE IS SOMETHING SOLEMNLY FUNNY ABOUT THE STRUGGLES OF A NEW BORN
TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT TO GET A START IN THIS WORLD
OURS HAD A TRYING
TIME OF IT
THE ORGANIC ACT AND THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE STATE
DEPARTMENT COMMANDED THAT A LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE ELECTED AT
SUCH AND SUCH A TIME AND ITS SITTINGS INAUGURATED AT SUCH AND SUCH A
DATE
IT WAS EASY TO GET LEGISLATORS EVEN AT THREE DOLLARS A DAY
ALTHOUGH BOARD WAS FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR DISTINCTION HAS ITS
CHARM IN NEVADA AS WELL AS ELSEWHERE AND THERE WERE PLENTY OF PATRIOTIC
SOULS OUT OF EMPLOYMENT BUT TO GET A LEGISLATIVE HALL FOR THEM TO MEET
IN WAS ANOTHER MATTER ALTOGETHER
CARSON BLANDLY DECLINED TO GIVE A ROOM
RENT FREE OR LET ONE TO THE GOVERNMENT ON CREDIT
BUT WHEN CURRY HEARD OF THE DIFFICULTY HE CAME FORWARD SOLITARY AND
ALONE AND SHOULDERED THE SHIP OF STATE OVER THE BAR AND GOT HER AFLOAT
AGAIN
I REFER TO CURRY OLD CURRY OLD ABE CURRY BUT FOR HIM THE
LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SIT IN THE DESERT
HE OFFERED HIS
LARGE STONE BUILDING JUST OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL LIMITS RENT FREE AND IT
WAS GLADLY ACCEPTED
THEN HE BUILT A HORSE RAILROAD FROM TOWN TO THE
CAPITOL AND CARRIED THE LEGISLATORS GRATIS
HE ALSO FURNISHED PINE BENCHES AND CHAIRS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND
COVERED THE FLOORS WITH CLEAN SAW DUST BY WAY OF CARPET AND SPITTOON
COMBINED
BUT FOR CURRY THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE DIED IN ITS TENDER
INFANCY
A CANVAS PARTITION TO SEPARATE THE SENATE FROM THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES WAS PUT UP BY THE SECRETARY AT A COST OF THREE DOLLARS
AND FORTY CENTS BUT THE UNITED STATES DECLINED TO PAY FOR IT
UPON
BEING REMINDED THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS PERMITTED THE PAYMENT OF A LIBERAL
RENT FOR A LEGISLATIVE HALL AND THAT THAT MONEY WAS SAVED TO THE COUNTRY
BY MR
CURRY'S GENEROSITY THE UNITED STATES SAID THAT DID NOT ALTER THE
MATTER AND THE THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS WOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM
THE SECRETARY'S EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR SALARY AND IT WAS
THE MATTER OF PRINTING WAS FROM THE BEGINNING AN INTERESTING FEATURE OF
THE NEW GOVERNMENT'S DIFFICULTIES
THE SECRETARY WAS SWORN TO OBEY HIS
VOLUME OF WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS AND THESE COMMANDED HIM TO DO TWO
CERTAIN THINGS WITHOUT FAIL VIZ
1
GET THE HOUSE AND SENATE JOURNALS PRINTED AND
2
FOR THIS WORK PAY ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS PER THOUSAND FOR
COMPOSITION AND ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS PER TOKEN FOR PRESS WORK
IN GREENBACKS
IT WAS EASY TO SWEAR TO DO THESE TWO THINGS BUT IT WAS ENTIRELY
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO MORE THAN ONE OF THEM
WHEN GREENBACKS HAD GONE DOWN TO
FORTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR THE PRICES REGULARLY CHARGED EVERYBODY BY
PRINTING ESTABLISHMENTS WERE ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS PER THOUSAND
AND ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS PER TOKEN IN GOLD
THE INSTRUCTIONS
COMMANDED THAT THE SECRETARY REGARD A PAPER DOLLAR ISSUED BY THE
GOVERNMENT AS EQUAL TO ANY OTHER DOLLAR ISSUED BY THE GOVERNMENT
HENCE
THE PRINTING OF THE JOURNALS WAS DISCONTINUED
THEN THE UNITED STATES
STERNLY REBUKED THE SECRETARY FOR DISREGARDING THE INSTRUCTIONS AND
WARNED HIM TO CORRECT HIS WAYS
WHEREFORE HE GOT SOME PRINTING DONE
FORWARDED THE BILL TO WASHINGTON WITH FULL EXHIBITS OF THE HIGH PRICES OF
THINGS IN THE TERRITORY AND CALLED ATTENTION TO A PRINTED MARKET REPORT
WHEREIN IT WOULD BE OBSERVED THAT EVEN HAY WAS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
DOLLARS A TON
THE UNITED STATES RESPONDED BY SUBTRACTING THE
PRINTING BILL FROM THE SECRETARY'S SUFFERING SALARY AND MOREOVER
REMARKED WITH DENSE GRAVITY THAT HE WOULD FIND NOTHING IN HIS
INSTRUCTIONS REQUIRING HIM TO PURCHASE HAY
NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS PALLED IN SUCH IMPENETRABLE OBSCURITY AS A U S
TREASURY COMPTROLLER'S UNDERSTANDING
THE VERY FIRES OF THE HEREAFTER
COULD GET UP NOTHING MORE THAN A FITFUL GLIMMER IN IT
IN THE DAYS I
SPEAK OF HE NEVER COULD BE MADE TO COMPREHEND WHY IT WAS THAT TWENTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD NOT GO AS FAR IN NEVADA WHERE ALL COMMODITIES
RANGED AT AN ENORMOUS FIGURE AS IT WOULD IN THE OTHER TERRITORIES WHERE
EXCEEDING CHEAPNESS WAS THE RULE
HE WAS AN OFFICER WHO LOOKED OUT FOR
THE LITTLE EXPENSES ALL THE TIME
THE SECRETARY OF THE TERRITORY KEPT
HIS OFFICE IN HIS BEDROOM AS I BEFORE REMARKED AND HE CHARGED THE
UNITED STATES NO RENT ALTHOUGH HIS INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED FOR THAT ITEM
AND HE COULD HAVE JUSTLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT A THING WHICH I WOULD
HAVE DONE WITH MORE THAN LIGHTNING PROMPTNESS IF I HAD BEEN SECRETARY
MYSELF
BUT THE UNITED STATES NEVER APPLAUDED THIS DEVOTION
INDEED I
THINK MY COUNTRY WAS ASHAMED TO HAVE SO IMPROVIDENT A PERSON IN ITS
EMPLOY
THOSE INSTRUCTIONS WE USED TO READ A CHAPTER FROM THEM EVERY MORNING
AS INTELLECTUAL GYMNASTICS AND A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS IN SUNDAY SCHOOL
EVERY SABBATH FOR THEY TREATED OF ALL SUBJECTS UNDER THE SUN AND HAD
MUCH VALUABLE RELIGIOUS MATTER IN THEM ALONG WITH THE OTHER STATISTICS
THOSE INSTRUCTIONS COMMANDED THAT PEN KNIVES ENVELOPES PENS AND
WRITING PAPER BE FURNISHED THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE
SO THE
SECRETARY MADE THE PURCHASE AND THE DISTRIBUTION
THE KNIVES COST THREE
DOLLARS APIECE
THERE WAS ONE TOO MANY AND THE SECRETARY GAVE IT TO THE
CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
THE UNITED STATES SAID THE CLERK
OF THE HOUSE WAS NOT A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE AND TOOK THAT THREE
DOLLARS OUT OF THE SECRETARY'S SALARY AS USUAL
WHITE MEN CHARGED THREE OR FOUR DOLLARS A LOAD FOR SAWING UP
STOVE WOOD
THE SECRETARY WAS SAGACIOUS ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THE UNITED
STATES WOULD NEVER PAY ANY SUCH PRICE AS THAT SO HE GOT AN INDIAN TO SAW
UP A LOAD OF OFFICE WOOD AT ONE DOLLAR AND A HALF
HE MADE OUT THE USUAL
VOUCHER BUT SIGNED NO NAME TO IT SIMPLY APPENDED A NOTE EXPLAINING THAT
AN INDIAN HAD DONE THE WORK AND HAD DONE IT IN A VERY CAPABLE AND
SATISFACTORY WAY BUT COULD NOT SIGN THE VOUCHER OWING TO LACK OF ABILITY
IN THE NECESSARY DIRECTION
THE SECRETARY HAD TO PAY THAT DOLLAR AND A
HALF
HE THOUGHT THE UNITED STATES WOULD ADMIRE BOTH HIS ECONOMY AND HIS
HONESTY IN GETTING THE WORK DONE AT HALF PRICE AND NOT PUTTING A
PRETENDED INDIAN'S SIGNATURE TO THE VOUCHER BUT THE UNITED STATES DID
NOT SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT
THE UNITED STATES WAS TOO MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO EMPLOYING DOLLAR AND A HALF
THIEVES IN ALL MANNER OF OFFICIAL CAPACITIES TO REGARD HIS EXPLANATION OF
THE VOUCHER AS HAVING ANY FOUNDATION IN FACT
BUT THE NEXT TIME THE INDIAN SAWED WOOD FOR US I TAUGHT HIM TO MAKE A
CROSS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VOUCHER IT LOOKED LIKE A CROSS THAT HAD BEEN
DRUNK A YEAR AND THEN I WITNESSED IT AND IT WENT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
THE UNITED STATES NEVER SAID A WORD
I WAS SORRY I HAD NOT MADE THE
VOUCHER FOR A THOUSAND LOADS OF WOOD INSTEAD OF ONE
THE GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY SNUBS HONEST SIMPLICITY BUT FONDLES ARTISTIC
VILLAINY AND I THINK I MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED INTO A VERY CAPABLE
PICKPOCKET IF I HAD REMAINED IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE A YEAR OR TWO
THAT WAS A FINE COLLECTION OF SOVEREIGNS THAT FIRST NEVADA LEGISLATURE
THEY LEVIED TAXES TO THE AMOUNT OF THIRTY OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND
ORDERED EXPENDITURES TO THE EXTENT OF ABOUT A MILLION
YET THEY HAD
THEIR LITTLE PERIODICAL EXPLOSIONS OF ECONOMY LIKE ALL OTHER BODIES OF
THE KIND
A MEMBER PROPOSED TO SAVE THREE DOLLARS A DAY TO THE NATION BY
DISPENSING WITH THE CHAPLAIN
AND YET THAT SHORT SIGHTED MAN NEEDED THE
CHAPLAIN MORE THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER PERHAPS FOR HE GENERALLY SAT WITH
HIS FEET ON HIS DESK EATING RAW TURNIPS DURING THE MORNING PRAYER
THE LEGISLATURE SAT SIXTY DAYS AND PASSED PRIVATE TOLLROAD FRANCHISES
ALL THE TIME
WHEN THEY ADJOURNED IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT EVERY CITIZEN
OWNED ABOUT THREE FRANCHISES AND IT WAS BELIEVED THAT UNLESS CONGRESS
GAVE THE TERRITORY ANOTHER DEGREE OF LONGITUDE THERE WOULD NOT BE ROOM
ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE THE TOLL ROADS
THE ENDS OF THEM WERE HANGING OVER
THE BOUNDARY LINE EVERYWHERE LIKE A FRINGE
THE FACT IS THE FREIGHTING BUSINESS HAD GROWN TO SUCH IMPORTANT
PROPORTIONS THAT THERE WAS NEARLY AS MUCH EXCITEMENT OVER SUDDENLY
ACQUIRED TOLL ROAD FORTUNES AS OVER THE WONDERFUL SILVER MINES
CHAPTER XXVI
BY AND BY I WAS SMITTEN WITH THE SILVER FEVER
PROSPECTING PARTIES
WERE LEAVING FOR THE MOUNTAINS EVERY DAY AND DISCOVERING AND TAKING
POSSESSION OF RICH SILVER BEARING LODES AND LEDGES OF QUARTZ
PLAINLY
THIS WAS THE ROAD TO FORTUNE
THE GREAT GOULD AND CURRY MINE WAS HELD
AT THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT WHEN WE ARRIVED BUT IN TWO
MONTHS IT HAD SPRUNG UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED
THE OPHIR HAD BEEN WORTH
ONLY A MERE TRIFLE A YEAR GONE BY AND NOW IT WAS SELLING AT NEARLY FOUR
THOUSAND DOLLARS A FOOT NOT A MINE COULD BE NAMED THAT HAD NOT
EXPERIENCED AN ASTONISHING ADVANCE IN VALUE WITHIN A SHORT TIME
EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THESE MARVELS
GO WHERE YOU WOULD YOU HEARD
NOTHING ELSE FROM MORNING TILL FAR INTO THE NIGHT
TOM SO AND SO HAD
SOLD OUT OF THE AMANDA SMITH FOR 40 000 HADN'T A CENT WHEN HE TOOK
UP THE LEDGE SIX MONTHS AGO
JOHN JONES HAD SOLD HALF HIS INTEREST IN
THE BALD EAGLE AND MARY ANN FOR 65 000 GOLD COIN AND GONE TO THE
STATES FOR HIS FAMILY
THE WIDOW BREWSTER HAD STRUCK IT RICH IN THE
GOLDEN FLEECE AND SOLD TEN FEET FOR 18 000 HADN'T MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY
A CRAPE BONNET WHEN SING SING TOMMY KILLED HER HUSBAND AT BALDY JOHNSON'S
WAKE LAST SPRING
THE LAST CHANCE HAD FOUND A CLAY CASING AND KNEW
THEY WERE RIGHT ON THE LEDGE CONSEQUENCE FEET THAT WENT BEGGING
YESTERDAY WERE WORTH A BRICK HOUSE APIECE TO DAY AND SEEDY OWNERS WHO
COULD NOT GET TRUSTED FOR A DRINK AT ANY BAR IN THE COUNTRY YESTERDAY
WERE ROARING DRUNK ON CHAMPAGNE TO DAY AND HAD HOSTS OF WARM PERSONAL
FRIENDS IN A TOWN WHERE THEY HAD FORGOTTEN HOW TO BOW OR SHAKE HANDS FROM
LONG CONTINUED WANT OF PRACTICE
JOHNNY MORGAN A COMMON LOAFER HAD
GONE TO SLEEP IN THE GUTTER AND WAKED UP WORTH A HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DECISION IN THE LADY FRANKLIN AND ROUGH
AND READY LAWSUIT
AND SO ON DAY IN AND DAY OUT THE TALK PELTED OUR
EARS AND THE EXCITEMENT WAXED HOTTER AND HOTTER AROUND US
I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OR LESS THAN HUMAN IF I HAD NOT GONE MAD LIKE THE
REST
CART LOADS OF SOLID SILVER BRICKS AS LARGE AS PIGS OF LEAD WERE
ARRIVING FROM THE MILLS EVERY DAY AND SUCH SIGHTS AS THAT GAVE SUBSTANCE
TO THE WILD TALK ABOUT ME
I SUCCUMBED AND GREW AS FRENZIED AS THE
CRAZIEST
EVERY FEW DAYS NEWS WOULD COME OF THE DISCOVERY OF A BRAN NEW MINING
REGION IMMEDIATELY THE PAPERS WOULD TEEM WITH ACCOUNTS OF ITS RICHNESS
AND AWAY THE SURPLUS POPULATION WOULD SCAMPER TO TAKE POSSESSION
BY THE
TIME I WAS FAIRLY INOCULATED WITH THE DISEASE ESMERALDA HAD JUST HAD A
RUN AND HUMBOLDT WAS BEGINNING TO SHRIEK FOR ATTENTION
HUMBOLDT
HUMBOLDT WAS THE NEW CRY AND STRAIGHTWAY HUMBOLDT THE NEWEST OF THE
NEW THE RICHEST OF THE RICH THE MOST MARVELLOUS OF THE MARVELLOUS
DISCOVERIES IN SILVER LAND WAS OCCUPYING TWO COLUMNS OF THE PUBLIC PRINTS
TO ESMERALDA'S ONE
I WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF STARTING TO ESMERALDA
BUT TURNED WITH THE TIDE AND GOT READY FOR HUMBOLDT
THAT THE READER MAY
SEE WHAT MOVED ME AND WHAT WOULD AS SURELY HAVE MOVED HIM HAD HE BEEN
THERE I INSERT HERE ONE OF THE NEWSPAPER LETTERS OF THE DAY
IT AND
SEVERAL OTHER LETTERS FROM THE SAME CALM HAND WERE THE MAIN MEANS OF
CONVERTING ME
I SHALL NOT GARBLE THE EXTRACT BUT PUT IT IN JUST AS IT
APPEARED IN THE DAILY TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR MINES I SHALL BE CANDID WITH YOU
I SHALL
EXPRESS AN HONEST OPINION BASED UPON A THOROUGH EXAMINATION
HUMBOLDT COUNTY IS THE RICHEST MINERAL REGION UPON GOD'S FOOTSTOOL
EACH MOUNTAIN RANGE IS GORGED WITH THE PRECIOUS ORES
HUMBOLDT IS
THE TRUE GOLCONDA
THE OTHER DAY AN ASSAY OF MERE CROPPINGS YIELDED EXCEEDING FOUR
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE TON
A WEEK OR TWO AGO AN ASSAY OF JUST
SUCH SURFACE DEVELOPMENTS MADE RETURNS OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO
THE TON
OUR MOUNTAINS ARE FULL OF RAMBLING PROSPECTORS
EACH DAY
AND ALMOST EVERY HOUR REVEALS NEW AND MORE STARTLING EVIDENCES OF
THE PROFUSE AND INTENSIFIED WEALTH OF OUR FAVORED COUNTY
THE METAL
IS NOT SILVER ALONE
THERE ARE DISTINCT LEDGES OF AURIFEROUS ORE
A LATE DISCOVERY PLAINLY EVINCES CINNABAR
THE COARSER METALS ARE
IN GROSS ABUNDANCE
LATELY EVIDENCES OF BITUMINOUS COAL HAVE BEEN
DETECTED
MY THEORY HAS EVER BEEN THAT COAL IS A LIGNEOUS
FORMATION
I TOLD COL
WHITMAN IN TIMES PAST THAT THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF DAYTON NEVADA BETRAYED NO PRESENT OR PREVIOUS
MANIFESTATIONS OF A LIGNEOUS FOUNDATION AND THAT HENCE I HAD NO
CONFIDENCE IN HIS LAUDED COAL MINES
I REPEATED THE SAME DOCTRINE
TO THE EXULTANT COAL DISCOVERERS OF HUMBOLDT
I TALKED WITH MY
FRIEND CAPTAIN BURCH ON THE SUBJECT
MY PYRHANISM VANISHED UPON HIS
STATEMENT THAT IN THE VERY REGION REFERRED TO HE HAD SEEN PETRIFIED
TREES OF THE LENGTH OF TWO HUNDRED FEET
THEN IS THE FACT
ESTABLISHED THAT HUGE FORESTS ONCE CAST THEIR GRIM SHADOWS OVER THIS
REMOTE SECTION
I AM FIRM IN THE COAL FAITH
HAVE NO FEARS OF THE MINERAL RESOURCES OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY
THEY ARE
IMMENSE INCALCULABLE
LET ME STATE ONE OR TWO THINGS WHICH WILL HELP THE READER TO BETTER
COMPREHEND CERTAIN ITEMS IN THE ABOVE
AT THIS TIME OUR NEAR NEIGHBOR
GOLD HILL WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SILVER MINING LOCALITY IN NEVADA
IT
WAS FROM THERE THAT MORE THAN HALF THE DAILY SHIPMENTS OF SILVER BRICKS
CAME
VERY RICH AND SCARCE GOLD HILL ORE YIELDED FROM 100 TO 400
TO THE TON BUT THE USUAL YIELD WAS ONLY 20 TO 40 PER TON THAT IS TO
SAY EACH HUNDRED POUNDS OF ORE YIELDED FROM ONE DOLLAR TO TWO DOLLARS
BUT THE READER WILL PERCEIVE BY THE ABOVE EXTRACT THAT IN HUMBOLDT FROM
ONE FOURTH TO NEARLY HALF THE MASS WAS SILVER THAT IS TO SAY EVERY ONE
HUNDRED POUNDS OF THE ORE HAD FROM TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS UP TO ABOUT THREE
HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN IT
SOME DAYS LATER THIS SAME CORRESPONDENT WROTE
I HAVE SPOKEN OF THE VAST AND ALMOST FABULOUS WEALTH OF THIS
REGION IT IS INCREDIBLE
THE INTESTINES OF OUR MOUNTAINS ARE
GORGED WITH PRECIOUS ORE TO PLETHORA
I HAVE SAID THAT NATURE
HAS SO SHAPED OUR MOUNTAINS AS TO FURNISH MOST EXCELLENT
FACILITIES FOR THE WORKING OF OUR MINES
I HAVE ALSO TOLD YOU
THAT THE COUNTRY ABOUT HERE IS PREGNANT WITH THE FINEST MILL
SITES IN THE WORLD
BUT WHAT IS THE MINING HISTORY OF HUMBOLDT
THE SHEBA MINE IS IN THE HANDS OF ENERGETIC SAN FRANCISCO
CAPITALISTS
IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE ORE IS COMBINED WITH METALS
THAT RENDER IT DIFFICULT OF REDUCTION WITH OUR IMPERFECT MOUNTAIN
MACHINERY
THE PROPRIETORS HAVE COMBINED THE CAPITAL AND LABOR
HINTED AT IN MY EXORDIUM
THEY ARE TOILING AND PROBING
THEIR
TUNNEL HAS REACHED THE LENGTH OF ONE HUNDRED FEET
FROM PRIMAL
ASSAYS ALONE COUPLED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINE AND PUBLIC
CONFIDENCE IN THE CONTINUANCE OF EFFORT THE STOCK HAD REARED
ITSELF TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS MARKET VALUE
I DO NOT KNOW THAT
ONE TON OF THE ORE HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO CURRENT METAL
I DO
KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY LODES IN THIS SECTION THAT SURPASS THE
SHEBA IN PRIMAL ASSAY VALUE
LISTEN A MOMENT TO THE CALCULATIONS
OF THE SHEBA OPERATORS
THEY PURPOSE TRANSPORTING THE ORE
CONCENTRATED TO EUROPE
THE CONVEYANCE FROM STAR CITY ITS
LOCALITY TO VIRGINIA CITY WILL COST SEVENTY DOLLARS PER TON
FROM VIRGINIA TO SAN FRANCISCO FORTY DOLLARS PER TON FROM
THENCE TO LIVERPOOL ITS DESTINATION TEN DOLLARS PER TON
THEIR
IDEA IS THAT ITS CONGLOMERATE METALS WILL REIMBURSE THEM THEIR
COST OF ORIGINAL EXTRACTION THE PRICE OF TRANSPORTATION AND THE
EXPENSE OF REDUCTION AND THAT THEN A TON OF THE RAW ORE WILL NET
THEM TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
THE ESTIMATE MAY BE EXTRAVAGANT
CUT IT IN TWAIN AND THE PRODUCT IS ENORMOUS FAR TRANSCENDING
ANY PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENTS OF OUR RACY TERRITORY
A VERY COMMON CALCULATION IS THAT MANY OF OUR MINES WILL YIELD
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO THE TON
SUCH FECUNDITY THROWS THE GOULD
CURRY THE OPHIR AND THE MEXICAN OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE
DARKEST SHADOW
I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF A
SINGLE DEVELOPED MINE
ITS RICHNESS IS INDEXED BY ITS MARKET
VALUATION
THE PEOPLE OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY ARE FEET CRAZY
AS I
WRITE OUR TOWNS ARE NEAR DESERTED
THEY LOOK AS LANGUID AS A
CONSUMPTIVE GIRL
WHAT HAS BECOME OF OUR SINEWY AND ATHLETIC
FELLOW CITIZENS THEY ARE COURSING THROUGH RAVINES AND OVER
MOUNTAIN TOPS
THEIR TRACKS ARE VISIBLE IN EVERY DIRECTION
OCCASIONALLY A HORSEMAN WILL DASH AMONG US
HIS STEED BETRAYS
HARD USAGE
HE ALIGHTS BEFORE HIS ADOBE DWELLING HASTILY
EXCHANGES COURTESIES WITH HIS TOWNSMEN HURRIES TO AN ASSAY
OFFICE AND FROM THENCE TO THE DISTRICT RECORDER'S
IN THE
MORNING HAVING RENEWED HIS PROVISIONAL SUPPLIES HE IS OFF AGAIN
ON HIS WILD AND UNBEATEN ROUTE
WHY THE FELLOW NUMBERS ALREADY
HIS FEET BY THE THOUSANDS
HE IS THE HORSE LEECH
HE HAS THE
CRAVING STOMACH OF THE SHARK OR ANACONDA
HE WOULD CONQUER
METALLIC WORLDS
THIS WAS ENOUGH
THE INSTANT WE HAD FINISHED READING THE ABOVE ARTICLE
FOUR OF US DECIDED TO GO TO HUMBOLDT
WE COMMENCED GETTING READY AT
ONCE
AND WE ALSO COMMENCED UPBRAIDING OURSELVES FOR NOT DECIDING
SOONER FOR WE WERE IN TERROR LEST ALL THE RICH MINES WOULD BE FOUND AND
SECURED BEFORE WE GOT THERE AND WE MIGHT HAVE TO PUT UP WITH LEDGES THAT
WOULD NOT YIELD MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A TON MAYBE
AN
HOUR BEFORE I WOULD HAVE FELT OPULENT IF I HAD OWNED TEN FEET IN A GOLD
HILL MINE WHOSE ORE PRODUCED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO THE TON NOW I WAS
ALREADY ANNOYED AT THE PROSPECT OF HAVING TO PUT UP WITH MINES THE
POOREST OF WHICH WOULD BE A MARVEL IN GOLD HILL
CHAPTER XXVII
HURRY WAS THE WORD WE WASTED NO TIME
OUR PARTY CONSISTED OF FOUR
PERSONS A BLACKSMITH SIXTY YEARS OF AGE TWO YOUNG LAWYERS AND MYSELF
WE BOUGHT A WAGON AND TWO MISERABLE OLD HORSES
WE PUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
POUNDS OF PROVISIONS AND MINING TOOLS IN THE WAGON AND DROVE OUT OF
CARSON ON A CHILLY DECEMBER AFTERNOON
THE HORSES WERE SO WEAK AND OLD
THAT WE SOON FOUND THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF ONE OR TWO OF US GOT OUT
AND WALKED
IT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT
NEXT WE FOUND THAT IT WOULD BE
BETTER IF A THIRD MAN GOT OUT
THAT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT ALSO
IT WAS AT
THIS TIME THAT I VOLUNTEERED TO DRIVE ALTHOUGH I HAD NEVER DRIVEN A
HARNESSED HORSE BEFORE AND MANY A MAN IN SUCH A POSITION WOULD HAVE FELT
FAIRLY EXCUSED FROM SUCH A RESPONSIBILITY
BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE IT WAS
FOUND THAT IT WOULD BE A FINE THING IF THE DRIVE GOT OUT AND WALKED ALSO
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT I RESIGNED THE POSITION OF DRIVER AND NEVER
RESUMED IT AGAIN
WITHIN THE HOUR WE FOUND THAT IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE
BETTER BUT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT WE FOUR TAKING TURNS TWO AT
A TIME SHOULD PUT OUR HANDS AGAINST THE END OF THE WAGON AND PUSH IT
THROUGH THE SAND LEAVING THE FEEBLE HORSES LITTLE TO DO BUT KEEP OUT OF
THE WAY AND HOLD UP THE TONGUE
PERHAPS IT IS WELL FOR ONE TO KNOW HIS
FATE AT FIRST AND GET RECONCILED TO IT
WE HAD LEARNED OURS IN ONE
AFTERNOON
IT WAS PLAIN THAT WE HAD TO WALK THROUGH THE SAND AND SHOVE
THAT WAGON AND THOSE HORSES TWO HUNDRED MILES
SO WE ACCEPTED THE
SITUATION AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH WE NEVER RODE
MORE THAN THAT WE
STOOD REGULAR AND NEARLY CONSTANT WATCHES PUSHING UP BEHIND
WE MADE SEVEN MILES AND CAMPED IN THE DESERT
YOUNG CLAGETT NOW MEMBER
OF CONGRESS FROM MONTANA UNHARNESSED AND FED AND WATERED THE HORSES
OLIPHANT AND I CUT SAGEBRUSH BUILT THE FIRE AND BROUGHT WATER TO COOK
WITH AND OLD MR
BALLOU THE BLACKSMITH DID THE COOKING
THIS DIVISION
OF LABOR AND THIS APPOINTMENT WAS ADHERED TO THROUGHOUT THE JOURNEY
WE HAD NO TENT AND SO WE SLEPT UNDER OUR BLANKETS IN THE OPEN PLAIN
WE
WERE SO TIRED THAT WE SLEPT SOUNDLY
WE WERE FIFTEEN DAYS MAKING THE TRIP TWO HUNDRED MILES THIRTEEN
RATHER FOR WE LAY BY A COUPLE OF DAYS IN ONE PLACE TO LET THE HORSES
REST
WE COULD REALLY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE JOURNEY IN TEN DAYS IF WE HAD TOWED
THE HORSES BEHIND THE WAGON BUT WE DID NOT THINK OF THAT UNTIL IT WAS
TOO LATE AND SO WENT ON SHOVING THE HORSES AND THE WAGON TOO WHEN WE
MIGHT HAVE SAVED HALF THE LABOR
PARTIES WHO MET US OCCASIONALLY
ADVISED US TO PUT THE HORSES IN THE WAGON BUT MR
BALLOU THROUGH WHOSE
IRON CLAD EARNESTNESS NO SARCASM COULD PIERCE SAID THAT THAT WOULD NOT
DO BECAUSE THE PROVISIONS WERE EXPOSED AND WOULD SUFFER THE HORSES
BEING BITUMINOUS FROM LONG DEPRIVATION THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME FROM
TRANSLATING
WHAT MR
BALLOU CUSTOMARILY MEANT WHEN HE USED A LONG
WORD WAS A SECRET BETWEEN HIMSELF AND HIS MAKER
HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST
AND KINDEST HEARTED MEN THAT EVER GRACED A HUMBLE SPHERE OF LIFE
HE WAS
GENTLENESS AND SIMPLICITY ITSELF AND UNSELFISHNESS TOO
ALTHOUGH HE
WAS MORE THAN TWICE AS OLD AS THE ELDEST OF US HE NEVER GAVE HIMSELF ANY
AIRS PRIVILEGES OR EXEMPTIONS ON THAT ACCOUNT
HE DID A YOUNG MAN'S
SHARE OF THE WORK AND DID HIS SHARE OF CONVERSING AND ENTERTAINING FROM
THE GENERAL STAND POINT OF ANY AGE NOT FROM THE ARROGANT OVERAWING
SUMMIT HEIGHT OF SIXTY YEARS
HIS ONE STRIKING PECULIARITY WAS HIS
PARTINGTONIAN FASHION OF LOVING AND USING BIG WORDS FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
AND INDEPENDENT OF ANY BEARING THEY MIGHT HAVE UPON THE THOUGHT HE WAS
PURPOSING TO CONVEY
HE ALWAYS LET HIS PONDEROUS SYLLABLES FALL WITH AN
EASY UNCONSCIOUSNESS THAT LEFT THEM WHOLLY WITHOUT OFFENSIVENESS
IN TRUTH HIS AIR WAS SO NATURAL AND SO SIMPLE THAT ONE WAS ALWAYS
CATCHING HIMSELF ACCEPTING HIS STATELY SENTENCES AS MEANING SOMETHING
WHEN THEY REALLY MEANT NOTHING IN THE WORLD
IF A WORD WAS LONG AND
GRAND AND RESONANT THAT WAS SUFFICIENT TO WIN THE OLD MAN'S LOVE AND HE
WOULD DROP THAT WORD INTO THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACE IN A SENTENCE OR
A SUBJECT AND BE AS PLEASED WITH IT AS IF IT WERE PERFECTLY LUMINOUS
WITH MEANING
WE FOUR ALWAYS SPREAD OUR COMMON STOCK OF BLANKETS TOGETHER ON THE FROZEN
GROUND AND SLEPT SIDE BY SIDE AND FINDING THAT OUR FOOLISH LONG LEGGED
HOUND PUP HAD A DEAL OF ANIMAL HEAT IN HIM OLIPHANT GOT TO ADMITTING HIM
TO THE BED BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MR
BALLOU HUGGING THE DOG'S WARM BACK
TO HIS BREAST AND FINDING GREAT COMFORT IN IT
BUT IN THE NIGHT THE PUP
WOULD GET STRETCHY AND BRACE HIS FEET AGAINST THE OLD MAN'S BACK AND
SHOVE GRUNTING COMPLACENTLY THE WHILE AND NOW AND THEN BEING WARM AND
SNUG GRATEFUL AND HAPPY HE WOULD PAW THE OLD MAN'S BACK SIMPLY IN
EXCESS OF COMFORT AND AT YET OTHER TIMES HE WOULD DREAM OF THE CHASE AND
IN HIS SLEEP TUG AT THE OLD MAN'S BACK HAIR AND BARK IN HIS EAR
THE OLD
GENTLEMAN COMPLAINED MILDLY ABOUT THESE FAMILIARITIES AT LAST AND WHEN
HE GOT THROUGH WITH HIS STATEMENT HE SAID THAT SUCH A DOG AS THAT WAS NOT
A PROPER ANIMAL TO ADMIT TO BED WITH TIRED MEN BECAUSE HE WAS SO
MERETRICIOUS IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND SO ORGANIC IN HIS EMOTIONS WE TURNED
THE DOG OUT
IT WAS A HARD WEARING TOILSOME JOURNEY BUT IT HAD ITS BRIGHT SIDE FOR
AFTER EACH DAY WAS DONE AND OUR WOLFISH HUNGER APPEASED WITH A HOT SUPPER
OF FRIED BACON BREAD MOLASSES AND BLACK COFFEE THE PIPE SMOKING
SONG SINGING AND YARN SPINNING AROUND THE EVENING CAMP FIRE IN THE STILL
SOLITUDES OF THE DESERT WAS A HAPPY CARE FREE SORT OF RECREATION THAT
SEEMED THE VERY SUMMIT AND CULMINATION OF EARTHLY LUXURY
IT IS A KIND OF LIFE THAT HAS A POTENT CHARM FOR ALL MEN WHETHER CITY OR
COUNTRY BRED
WE ARE DESCENDED FROM DESERT LOUNGING ARABS AND COUNTLESS
AGES OF GROWTH TOWARD PERFECT CIVILIZATION HAVE FAILED TO ROOT OUT OF US
THE NOMADIC INSTINCT
WE ALL CONFESS TO A GRATIFIED THRILL AT THE
THOUGHT OF CAMPING OUT
ONCE WE MADE TWENTY FIVE MILES IN A DAY AND ONCE WE MADE FORTY MILES
THROUGH THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT AND TEN MILES BEYOND FIFTY IN ALL
IN TWENTY THREE HOURS WITHOUT HALTING TO EAT DRINK OR REST
TO STRETCH
OUT AND GO TO SLEEP EVEN ON STONY AND FROZEN GROUND AFTER PUSHING A
WAGON AND TWO HORSES FIFTY MILES IS A DELIGHT SO SUPREME THAT FOR THE
MOMENT IT ALMOST SEEMS CHEAP AT THE PRICE
WE CAMPED TWO DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SINK OF THE HUMBOLDT
WE TRIED TO USE THE STRONG ALKALINE WATER OF THE SINK BUT IT WOULD NOT
ANSWER
IT WAS LIKE DRINKING LYE AND NOT WEAK LYE EITHER
IT LEFT A
TASTE IN THE MOUTH BITTER AND EVERY WAY EXECRABLE AND A BURNING IN THE
STOMACH THAT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
WE PUT MOLASSES IN IT BUT THAT
HELPED IT VERY LITTLE WE ADDED A PICKLE YET THE ALKALI WAS THE
PROMINENT TASTE AND SO IT WAS UNFIT FOR DRINKING
THE COFFEE WE MADE OF THIS WATER WAS THE MEANEST COMPOUND MAN HAS YET
INVENTED
IT WAS REALLY VILER TO THE TASTE THAN THE UNAMELIORATED WATER
ITSELF
MR
BALLOU BEING THE ARCHITECT AND BUILDER OF THE BEVERAGE FELT
CONSTRAINED TO ENDORSE AND UPHOLD IT AND SO DRANK HALF A CUP BY LITTLE
SIPS MAKING SHIFT TO PRAISE IT FAINTLY THE WHILE BUT FINALLY THREW OUT
THE REMAINDER AND SAID FRANKLY IT WAS TOO TECHNICAL FOR HIM
BUT PRESENTLY WE FOUND A SPRING OF FRESH WATER CONVENIENT AND THEN
WITH NOTHING TO MAR OUR ENJOYMENT AND NO STRAGGLERS TO INTERRUPT IT WE
ENTERED INTO OUR REST
CHAPTER XXVIII
AFTER LEAVING THE SINK WE TRAVELED ALONG THE HUMBOLDT RIVER A LITTLE
WAY
PEOPLE ACCUSTOMED TO THE MONSTER MILE WIDE MISSISSIPPI GROW
ACCUSTOMED TO ASSOCIATING THE TERM RIVER WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF WATERY
GRANDEUR
CONSEQUENTLY SUCH PEOPLE FEEL RATHER DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY
STAND ON THE SHORES OF THE HUMBOLDT OR THE CARSON AND FIND THAT A RIVER
IN NEVADA IS A SICKLY RIVULET WHICH IS JUST THE COUNTERPART OF THE ERIE
CANAL IN ALL RESPECTS SAVE THAT THE CANAL IS TWICE AS LONG AND FOUR TIMES
AS DEEP
ONE OF THE PLEASANTEST AND MOST INVIGORATING EXERCISES ONE CAN
CONTRIVE IS TO RUN AND JUMP ACROSS THE HUMBOLDT RIVER TILL HE IS
OVERHEATED AND THEN DRINK IT DRY
ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY WE COMPLETED OUR MARCH OF TWO HUNDRED MILES AND
ENTERED UNIONVILLE HUMBOLDT COUNTY IN THE MIDST OF A DRIVING
SNOW STORM
UNIONVILLE CONSISTED OF ELEVEN CABINS AND A LIBERTY POLE
SIX OF THE CABINS WERE STRUNG ALONG ONE SIDE OF A DEEP CANYON AND THE
OTHER FIVE FACED THEM
THE REST OF THE LANDSCAPE WAS MADE UP OF BLEAK
MOUNTAIN WALLS THAT ROSE SO HIGH INTO THE SKY FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE
CANYON THAT THE VILLAGE WAS LEFT AS IT WERE FAR DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF A
CREVICE
IT WAS ALWAYS DAYLIGHT ON THE MOUNTAIN TOPS A LONG TIME BEFORE
THE DARKNESS LIFTED AND REVEALED UNIONVILLE
WE BUILT A SMALL RUDE CABIN IN THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE AND ROOFED IT
WITH CANVAS LEAVING A CORNER OPEN TO SERVE AS A CHIMNEY THROUGH WHICH
THE CATTLE USED TO TUMBLE OCCASIONALLY AT NIGHT AND MASH OUR FURNITURE
AND INTERRUPT OUR SLEEP
IT WAS VERY COLD WEATHER AND FUEL WAS SCARCE
INDIANS BROUGHT BRUSH AND BUSHES SEVERAL MILES ON THEIR BACKS AND WHEN
WE COULD CATCH A LADEN INDIAN IT WAS WELL AND WHEN WE COULD NOT WHICH
WAS THE RULE NOT THE EXCEPTION WE SHIVERED AND BORE IT
I CONFESS WITHOUT SHAME THAT I EXPECTED TO FIND MASSES OF SILVER LYING
ALL ABOUT THE GROUND
I EXPECTED TO SEE IT GLITTERING IN THE SUN ON THE
MOUNTAIN SUMMITS
I SAID NOTHING ABOUT THIS FOR SOME INSTINCT TOLD ME
THAT I MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE AN EXAGGERATED IDEA ABOUT IT AND SO IF I
BETRAYED MY THOUGHT I MIGHT BRING DERISION UPON MYSELF
YET I WAS AS
PERFECTLY SATISFIED IN MY OWN MIND AS I COULD BE OF ANYTHING THAT I WAS
GOING TO GATHER UP IN A DAY OR TWO OR AT FURTHEST A WEEK OR TWO SILVER
ENOUGH TO MAKE ME SATISFACTORILY WEALTHY AND SO MY FANCY WAS ALREADY
BUSY WITH PLANS FOR SPENDING THIS MONEY
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT
OFFERED I SAUNTERED CARELESSLY AWAY FROM THE CABIN KEEPING AN EYE ON
THE OTHER BOYS AND STOPPING AND CONTEMPLATING THE SKY WHEN THEY SEEMED
TO BE OBSERVING ME BUT AS SOON AS THE COAST WAS MANIFESTLY CLEAR I FLED
AWAY AS GUILTILY AS A THIEF MIGHT HAVE DONE AND NEVER HALTED TILL I WAS
FAR BEYOND SIGHT AND CALL
THEN I BEGAN MY SEARCH WITH A FEVERISH
EXCITEMENT THAT WAS BRIMFUL OF EXPECTATION ALMOST OF CERTAINTY
I CRAWLED ABOUT THE GROUND SEIZING AND EXAMINING BITS OF STONE BLOWING
THE DUST FROM THEM OR RUBBING THEM ON MY CLOTHES AND THEN PEERING AT
THEM WITH ANXIOUS HOPE
PRESENTLY I FOUND A BRIGHT FRAGMENT AND MY HEART
BOUNDED I HID BEHIND A BOULDER AND POLISHED IT AND SCRUTINIZED IT WITH
A NERVOUS EAGERNESS AND A DELIGHT THAT WAS MORE PRONOUNCED THAN ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY ITSELF COULD HAVE AFFORDED
THE MORE I EXAMINED THE FRAGMENT
THE MORE I WAS CONVINCED THAT I HAD FOUND THE DOOR TO FORTUNE
I MARKED
THE SPOT AND CARRIED AWAY MY SPECIMEN
UP AND DOWN THE RUGGED MOUNTAIN
SIDE I SEARCHED WITH ALWAYS INCREASING INTEREST AND ALWAYS AUGMENTING
GRATITUDE THAT I HAD COME TO HUMBOLDT AND COME IN TIME
OF ALL THE
EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE THIS SECRET SEARCH AMONG THE HIDDEN TREASURES OF
SILVER LAND WAS THE NEAREST TO UNMARRED ECSTASY
IT WAS A DELIRIOUS
REVEL
BY AND BY IN THE BED OF A SHALLOW RIVULET I FOUND A DEPOSIT OF SHINING
YELLOW SCALES AND MY BREATH ALMOST FORSOOK ME A GOLD MINE AND IN MY
SIMPLICITY I HAD BEEN CONTENT WITH VULGAR SILVER I WAS SO EXCITED THAT
I HALF BELIEVED MY OVERWROUGHT IMAGINATION WAS DECEIVING ME
THEN A FEAR
CAME UPON ME THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE OBSERVING ME AND WOULD GUESS MY SECRET
MOVED BY THIS THOUGHT I MADE A CIRCUIT OF THE PLACE AND ASCENDED A
KNOLL TO RECONNOITER
SOLITUDE
NO CREATURE WAS NEAR
THEN I RETURNED
TO MY MINE FORTIFYING MYSELF AGAINST POSSIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT BUT MY
FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS THE SHINING SCALES WERE STILL THERE
I SET ABOUT
SCOOPING THEM OUT AND FOR AN HOUR I TOILED DOWN THE WINDINGS OF THE
STREAM AND ROBBED ITS BED
BUT AT LAST THE DESCENDING SUN WARNED ME TO
GIVE UP THE QUEST AND I TURNED HOMEWARD LADEN WITH WEALTH
AS I WALKED
ALONG I COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE THOUGHT OF MY BEING SO EXCITED OVER
MY FRAGMENT OF SILVER WHEN A NOBLER METAL WAS ALMOST UNDER MY NOSE
IN
THIS LITTLE TIME THE FORMER HAD SO FALLEN IN MY ESTIMATION THAT ONCE OR
TWICE I WAS ON THE POINT OF THROWING IT AWAY
THE BOYS WERE AS HUNGRY AS USUAL BUT I COULD EAT NOTHING
NEITHER COULD
I TALK
I WAS FULL OF DREAMS AND FAR AWAY
THEIR CONVERSATION
INTERRUPTED THE FLOW OF MY FANCY SOMEWHAT AND ANNOYED ME A LITTLE TOO
I DESPISED THE SORDID AND COMMONPLACE THINGS THEY TALKED ABOUT
BUT AS
THEY PROCEEDED IT BEGAN TO AMUSE ME
IT GREW TO BE RARE FUN TO HEAR
THEM PLANNING THEIR POOR LITTLE ECONOMIES AND SIGHING OVER POSSIBLE
PRIVATIONS AND DISTRESSES WHEN A GOLD MINE ALL OUR OWN LAY WITHIN SIGHT
OF THE CABIN AND I COULD POINT IT OUT AT ANY MOMENT
SMOTHERED HILARITY
BEGAN TO OPPRESS ME PRESENTLY
IT WAS HARD TO RESIST THE IMPULSE TO
BURST OUT WITH EXULTATION AND REVEAL EVERYTHING BUT I DID RESIST
I
SAID WITHIN MYSELF THAT I WOULD FILTER THE GREAT NEWS THROUGH MY LIPS
CALMLY AND BE SERENE AS A SUMMER MORNING WHILE I WATCHED ITS EFFECT IN
THEIR FACES
I SAID
WHERE HAVE YOU ALL BEEN
PROSPECTING
WHAT DID YOU FIND
NOTHING
NOTHING WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE COUNTRY
CAN'T TELL YET SAID MR
BALLOU WHO WAS AN OLD GOLD MINER AND HAD
LIKEWISE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE AMONG THE SILVER MINES
WELL HAVEN'T YOU FORMED ANY SORT OF OPINION
YES A SORT OF A ONE
IT'S FAIR ENOUGH HERE MAY BE BUT OVERRATED
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR LEDGES ARE SCARCE THOUGH
THAT SHEBA MAY BE RICH ENOUGH BUT WE DON'T OWN IT AND BESIDES THE ROCK
IS SO FULL OF BASE METALS THAT ALL THE SCIENCE IN THE WORLD CAN'T WORK
IT
WE'LL NOT STARVE HERE BUT WE'LL NOT GET RICH I'M AFRAID
SO YOU THINK THE PROSPECT IS PRETTY POOR
NO NAME FOR IT
WELL WE'D BETTER GO BACK HADN'T WE
OH NOT YET OF COURSE NOT
WE'LL TRY IT A RIFFLE FIRST
SUPPOSE NOW THIS IS MERELY A SUPPOSITION YOU KNOW SUPPOSE YOU COULD
FIND A LEDGE THAT WOULD YIELD SAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A TON
WOULD THAT SATISFY YOU
TRY US ONCE FROM THE WHOLE PARTY
OR SUPPOSE MERELY A SUPPOSITION OF COURSE SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO FIND A
LEDGE THAT WOULD YIELD TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A TON WOULD THAT SATISFY
YOU
HERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT ARE YOU COMING AT IS THERE SOME MYSTERY
BEHIND ALL THIS
NEVER MIND
I AM NOT SAYING ANYTHING
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THERE
ARE NO RICH MINES HERE OF COURSE YOU DO
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND
AND EXAMINED FOR YOURSELVES
ANYBODY WOULD KNOW THAT THAT HAD BEEN
AROUND
BUT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT SUPPOSE IN A KIND OF GENERAL
WAY SUPPOSE SOME PERSON WERE TO TELL YOU THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR LEDGES
WERE SIMPLY CONTEMPTIBLE CONTEMPTIBLE UNDERSTAND AND THAT RIGHT YONDER
IN SIGHT OF THIS VERY CABIN THERE WERE PILES OF PURE GOLD AND PURE
SILVER OCEANS OF IT ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU ALL RICH IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
COME
I SHOULD SAY HE WAS AS CRAZY AS A LOON SAID OLD BALLOU BUT WILD WITH
EXCITEMENT NEVERTHELESS
GENTLEMEN SAID I I DON'T SAY ANYTHING I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND YOU
KNOW AND OF COURSE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING BUT ALL I ASK OF YOU IS TO CAST
YOUR EYE ON THAT FOR INSTANCE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT AND I
TOSSED MY TREASURE BEFORE THEM
THERE WAS AN EAGER SCRAMBLE FOR IT AND A CLOSING OF HEADS TOGETHER OVER
IT UNDER THE CANDLE LIGHT
THEN OLD BALLOU SAID
THINK OF IT I THINK IT IS NOTHING BUT A LOT OF GRANITE RUBBISH AND
NASTY GLITTERING MICA THAT ISN'T WORTH TEN CENTS AN ACRE
SO VANISHED MY DREAM
SO MELTED MY WEALTH AWAY
SO TOPPLED MY AIRY
CASTLE TO THE EARTH AND LEFT ME STRICKEN AND FORLORN
MORALIZING I OBSERVED THEN THAT ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD
MR
BALLOU SAID I COULD GO FURTHER THAN THAT AND LAY IT UP AMONG MY
TREASURES OF KNOWLEDGE THAT NOTHING THAT GLITTERS IS GOLD
SO I LEARNED
THEN ONCE FOR ALL THAT GOLD IN ITS NATIVE STATE IS BUT DULL
UNORNAMENTAL STUFF AND THAT ONLY LOW BORN METALS EXCITE THE ADMIRATION
OF THE IGNORANT WITH AN OSTENTATIOUS GLITTER
HOWEVER LIKE THE REST OF
THE WORLD I STILL GO ON UNDERRATING MEN OF GOLD AND GLORIFYING MEN OF
MICA
COMMONPLACE HUMAN NATURE CANNOT RISE ABOVE THAT
CHAPTER XXIX
TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF SILVER MINING CAME FAST ENOUGH
WE WENT
OUT PROSPECTING WITH MR
BALLOU
WE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN SIDES AND
CLAMBERED AMONG SAGE BRUSH ROCKS AND SNOW TILL WE WERE READY TO DROP
WITH EXHAUSTION BUT FOUND NO SILVER NOR YET ANY GOLD
DAY AFTER DAY WE
DID THIS
NOW AND THEN WE CAME UPON HOLES BURROWED A FEW FEET INTO THE
DECLIVITIES AND APPARENTLY ABANDONED AND NOW AND THEN WE FOUND ONE OR
TWO LISTLESS MEN STILL BURROWING
BUT THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF SILVER
THESE HOLES WERE THE BEGINNINGS OF TUNNELS AND THE PURPOSE WAS TO DRIVE
THEM HUNDREDS OF FEET INTO THE MOUNTAIN AND SOME DAY TAP THE HIDDEN
LEDGE WHERE THE SILVER WAS
SOME DAY IT SEEMED FAR ENOUGH AWAY AND
VERY HOPELESS AND DREARY
DAY AFTER DAY WE TOILED AND CLIMBED AND
SEARCHED AND WE YOUNGER PARTNERS GREW SICKER AND STILL SICKER OF THE
PROMISELESS TOIL
AT LAST WE HALTED UNDER A BEETLING RAMPART OF ROCK
WHICH PROJECTED FROM THE EARTH HIGH UPON THE MOUNTAIN
MR
BALLOU BROKE
OFF SOME FRAGMENTS WITH A HAMMER AND EXAMINED THEM LONG AND ATTENTIVELY
WITH A SMALL EYE GLASS THREW THEM AWAY AND BROKE OFF MORE SAID THIS
ROCK WAS QUARTZ AND QUARTZ WAS THE SORT OF ROCK THAT CONTAINED SILVER
CONTAINED IT I HAD THOUGHT THAT AT LEAST IT WOULD BE CAKED ON THE
OUTSIDE OF IT LIKE A KIND OF VENEERING
HE STILL BROKE OFF PIECES AND
CRITICALLY EXAMINED THEM NOW AND THEN WETTING THE PIECE WITH HIS TONGUE
AND APPLYING THE GLASS
AT LAST HE EXCLAIMED
WE'VE GOT IT
WE WERE FULL OF ANXIETY IN A MOMENT
THE ROCK WAS CLEAN AND WHITE WHERE
IT WAS BROKEN AND ACROSS IT RAN A RAGGED THREAD OF BLUE
HE SAID THAT
THAT LITTLE THREAD HAD SILVER IN IT MIXED WITH BASE METAL SUCH AS LEAD
AND ANTIMONY AND OTHER RUBBISH AND THAT THERE WAS A SPECK OR TWO OF
GOLD VISIBLE
AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT WE MANAGED TO DISCERN SOME
LITTLE FINE YELLOW SPECKS AND JUDGED THAT A COUPLE OF TONS OF THEM
MASSED TOGETHER MIGHT MAKE A GOLD DOLLAR POSSIBLY
WE WERE NOT
JUBILANT BUT MR
BALLOU SAID THERE WERE WORSE LEDGES IN THE WORLD THAN
THAT
HE SAVED WHAT HE CALLED THE RICHEST PIECE OF THE ROCK IN ORDER
TO DETERMINE ITS VALUE BY THE PROCESS CALLED THE FIRE ASSAY THEN WE
NAMED THE MINE MONARCH OF THE MOUNTAINS MODESTY OF NOMENCLATURE IS NOT
A PROMINENT FEATURE IN THE MINES AND MR
BALLOU WROTE OUT AND STUCK UP
THE FOLLOWING NOTICE PRESERVING A COPY TO BE ENTERED UPON THE BOOKS IN
THE MINING RECORDER'S OFFICE IN THE TOWN
NOTICE
WE THE UNDERSIGNED CLAIM THREE CLAIMS OF THREE HUNDRED FEET EACH
AND ONE FOR DISCOVERY ON THIS SILVER BEARING QUARTZ LEAD OR LODE
EXTENDING NORTH AND SOUTH FROM THIS NOTICE WITH ALL ITS DIPS
SPURS AND ANGLES VARIATIONS AND SINUOSITIES TOGETHER WITH FIFTY
FEET OF GROUND ON EITHER SIDE FOR WORKING THE SAME
WE PUT OUR NAMES TO IT AND TRIED TO FEEL THAT OUR FORTUNES WERE MADE
BUT WHEN WE TALKED THE MATTER ALL OVER WITH MR
BALLOU WE FELT DEPRESSED
AND DUBIOUS
HE SAID THAT THIS SURFACE QUARTZ WAS NOT ALL THERE WAS OF
OUR MINE BUT THAT THE WALL OR LEDGE OF ROCK CALLED THE MONARCH OF THE
MOUNTAINS EXTENDED DOWN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF FEET INTO THE EARTH
HE ILLUSTRATED BY SAYING IT WAS LIKE A CURB STONE AND MAINTAINED A
NEARLY UNIFORM THICKNESS SAY TWENTY FEET AWAY DOWN INTO THE BOWELS OF
THE EARTH AND WAS PERFECTLY DISTINCT FROM THE CASING ROCK ON EACH SIDE
OF IT AND THAT IT KEPT TO ITSELF AND MAINTAINED ITS DISTINCTIVE
CHARACTER ALWAYS NO MATTER HOW DEEP IT EXTENDED INTO THE EARTH OR HOW
FAR IT STRETCHED ITSELF THROUGH AND ACROSS THE HILLS AND VALLEYS
HE
SAID IT MIGHT BE A MILE DEEP AND TEN MILES LONG FOR ALL WE KNEW AND
THAT WHEREVER WE BORED INTO IT ABOVE GROUND OR BELOW WE WOULD FIND GOLD
AND SILVER IN IT BUT NO GOLD OR SILVER IN THE MEANER ROCK IT WAS CASED
BETWEEN
AND HE SAID THAT DOWN IN THE GREAT DEPTHS OF THE LEDGE WAS ITS
RICHNESS AND THE DEEPER IT WENT THE RICHER IT GREW
THEREFORE INSTEAD
OF WORKING HERE ON THE SURFACE WE MUST EITHER BORE DOWN INTO THE ROCK
WITH A SHAFT TILL WE CAME TO WHERE IT WAS RICH SAY A HUNDRED FEET OR SO
OR ELSE WE MUST GO DOWN INTO THE VALLEY AND BORE A LONG TUNNEL INTO THE
MOUNTAIN SIDE AND TAP THE LEDGE FAR UNDER THE EARTH
TO DO EITHER WAS
PLAINLY THE LABOR OF MONTHS FOR WE COULD BLAST AND BORE ONLY A FEW FEET
A DAY SOME FIVE OR SIX
BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
HE SAID THAT AFTER WE
GOT THE ORE OUT IT MUST BE HAULED IN WAGONS TO A DISTANT SILVER MILL
GROUND UP AND THE SILVER EXTRACTED BY A TEDIOUS AND COSTLY PROCESS
OUR
FORTUNE SEEMED A CENTURY AWAY
BUT WE WENT TO WORK
WE DECIDED TO SINK A SHAFT
SO FOR A WEEK WE
CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN LADEN WITH PICKS DRILLS GADS CROWBARS SHOVELS
CANS OF BLASTING POWDER AND COILS OF FUSE AND STROVE WITH MIGHT AND MAIN
AT FIRST THE ROCK WAS BROKEN AND LOOSE AND WE DUG IT UP WITH PICKS AND
THREW IT OUT WITH SHOVELS AND THE HOLE PROGRESSED VERY WELL
BUT THE
ROCK BECAME MORE COMPACT PRESENTLY AND GADS AND CROWBARS CAME INTO
PLAY
BUT SHORTLY NOTHING COULD MAKE AN IMPRESSION BUT BLASTING POWDER
THAT WAS THE WEARIEST WORK ONE OF US HELD THE IRON DRILL IN ITS PLACE
AND ANOTHER WOULD STRIKE WITH AN EIGHT POUND SLEDGE IT WAS LIKE DRIVING
NAILS ON A LARGE SCALE
IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR OR TWO THE DRILL WOULD
REACH A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE FEET MAKING A HOLE A COUPLE OF INCHES IN
DIAMETER
WE WOULD PUT IN A CHARGE OF POWDER INSERT HALF A YARD OF
FUSE POUR IN SAND AND GRAVEL AND RAM IT DOWN THEN LIGHT THE FUSE AND
RUN
WHEN THE EXPLOSION CAME AND THE ROCKS AND SMOKE SHOT INTO THE AIR
WE WOULD GO BACK AND FIND ABOUT A BUSHEL OF THAT HARD REBELLIOUS QUARTZ
JOLTED OUT
NOTHING MORE
ONE WEEK OF THIS SATISFIED ME
I RESIGNED
CLAGGET AND OLIPHANT FOLLOWED
OUR SHAFT WAS ONLY TWELVE FEET DEEP
WE
DECIDED THAT A TUNNEL WAS THE THING WE WANTED
SO WE WENT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AND WORKED A WEEK AT THE END OF WHICH
TIME WE HAD BLASTED A TUNNEL ABOUT DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE A HOGSHEAD IN AND
JUDGED THAT ABOUT NINE HUNDRED FEET MORE OF IT WOULD REACH THE LEDGE
I RESIGNED AGAIN AND THE OTHER BOYS ONLY HELD OUT ONE DAY LONGER
WE DECIDED THAT A TUNNEL WAS NOT WHAT WE WANTED
WE WANTED A LEDGE THAT
WAS ALREADY DEVELOPED THERE WERE NONE IN THE CAMP
WE DROPPED THE MONARCH FOR THE TIME BEING
MEANTIME THE CAMP WAS FILLING UP WITH PEOPLE AND THERE WAS A CONSTANTLY
GROWING EXCITEMENT ABOUT OUR HUMBOLDT MINES
WE FELL VICTIMS TO THE
EPIDEMIC AND STRAINED EVERY NERVE TO ACQUIRE MORE FEET WE PROSPECTED
AND TOOK UP NEW CLAIMS PUT NOTICES ON THEM AND GAVE THEM GRANDILOQUENT
NAMES
WE TRADED SOME OF OUR FEET FOR FEET IN OTHER PEOPLE'S CLAIMS
IN A LITTLE WHILE WE OWNED LARGELY IN THE GRAY EAGLE THE COLUMBIANA
THE BRANCH MINT THE MARIA JANE THE UNIVERSE THE
ROOT HOG OR DIE THE SAMSON AND DELILAH THE TREASURE TROVE THE
GOLCONDA THE SULTANA THE BOOMERANG THE GREAT REPUBLIC THE
GRAND MOGUL AND FIFTY OTHER MINES THAT HAD NEVER BEEN MOLESTED BY A
SHOVEL OR SCRATCHED WITH A PICK
WE HAD NOT LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND
FEET APIECE IN THE RICHEST MINES ON EARTH AS THE FRENZIED CANT
PHRASED IT AND WERE IN DEBT TO THE BUTCHER
WE WERE STARK MAD WITH
EXCITEMENT DRUNK WITH HAPPINESS SMOTHERED UNDER MOUNTAINS OF
PROSPECTIVE WEALTH ARROGANTLY COMPASSIONATE TOWARD THE PLODDING MILLIONS
WHO KNEW NOT OUR MARVELLOUS CANYON BUT OUR CREDIT WAS NOT GOOD AT THE
GROCER'S
IT WAS THE STRANGEST PHASE OF LIFE ONE CAN IMAGINE
IT WAS A BEGGARS'
REVEL
THERE WAS NOTHING DOING IN THE DISTRICT NO MINING NO MILLING
NO PRODUCTIVE EFFORT NO INCOME AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE ENTIRE CAMP
TO BUY A CORNER LOT IN AN EASTERN VILLAGE HARDLY AND YET A STRANGER
WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HE WAS WALKING AMONG BLOATED MILLIONAIRES
PROSPECTING PARTIES SWARMED OUT OF TOWN WITH THE FIRST FLUSH OF DAWN AND
SWARMED IN AGAIN AT NIGHTFALL LADEN WITH SPOIL ROCKS
NOTHING BUT
ROCKS
EVERY MAN'S POCKETS WERE FULL OF THEM THE FLOOR OF HIS CABIN WAS
LITTERED WITH THEM THEY WERE DISPOSED IN LABELED ROWS ON HIS SHELVES
CHAPTER XXX
I MET MEN AT EVERY TURN WHO OWNED FROM ONE THOUSAND TO THIRTY THOUSAND
FEET IN UNDEVELOPED SILVER MINES EVERY SINGLE FOOT OF WHICH THEY
BELIEVED WOULD SHORTLY BE WORTH FROM FIFTY TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND AS
OFTEN AS ANY OTHER WAY THEY WERE MEN WHO HAD NOT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IN
THE WORLD
EVERY MAN YOU MET HAD HIS NEW MINE TO BOAST OF AND HIS
SPECIMENS READY AND IF THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED HE WOULD INFALLIBLY
BACK YOU INTO A CORNER AND OFFER AS A FAVOR TO YOU NOT TO HIM TO PART
WITH JUST A FEW FEET IN THE GOLDEN AGE OR THE SARAH JANE OR SOME
OTHER UNKNOWN STACK OF CROPPINGS FOR MONEY ENOUGH TO GET A SQUARE MEAL
WITH AS THE PHRASE WENT
AND YOU WERE NEVER TO REVEAL THAT HE HAD MADE
YOU THE OFFER AT SUCH A RUINOUS PRICE FOR IT WAS ONLY OUT OF FRIENDSHIP
FOR YOU THAT HE WAS WILLING TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
THEN HE WOULD FISH A
PIECE OF ROCK OUT OF HIS POCKET AND AFTER LOOKING MYSTERIOUSLY AROUND AS
IF HE FEARED HE MIGHT BE WAYLAID AND ROBBED IF CAUGHT WITH SUCH WEALTH IN
HIS POSSESSION HE WOULD DAB THE ROCK AGAINST HIS TONGUE CLAP AN
EYEGLASS TO IT AND EXCLAIM
LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE IN THAT RED DIRT SEE IT SEE THE SPECKS OF
GOLD AND THE STREAK OF SILVER THAT'S FROM THE UNCLE ABE
THERE'S A
HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS LIKE THAT IN SIGHT RIGHT IN SIGHT MIND YOU
AND WHEN WE GET DOWN ON IT AND THE LEDGE COMES IN SOLID IT WILL BE THE
RICHEST THING IN THE WORLD LOOK AT THE ASSAY I DON'T WANT YOU TO
BELIEVE ME LOOK AT THE ASSAY
THEN HE WOULD GET OUT A GREASY SHEET OF PAPER WHICH SHOWED THAT THE
PORTION OF ROCK ASSAYED HAD GIVEN EVIDENCE OF CONTAINING SILVER AND GOLD
IN THE PROPORTION OF SO MANY HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO THE TON
I LITTLE KNEW THEN THAT THE CUSTOM WAS TO HUNT OUT THE RICHEST PIECE OF
ROCK AND GET IT ASSAYED VERY OFTEN THAT PIECE THE SIZE OF A FILBERT
WAS THE ONLY FRAGMENT IN A TON THAT HAD A PARTICLE OF METAL IN IT AND
YET THE ASSAY MADE IT PRETEND TO REPRESENT THE AVERAGE VALUE OF THE TON
OF RUBBISH IT CAME FROM
ON SUCH A SYSTEM OF ASSAYING AS THAT THE HUMBOLDT WORLD HAD GONE CRAZY
ON THE AUTHORITY OF SUCH ASSAYS ITS NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS WERE
FROTHING ABOUT ROCK WORTH FOUR AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A TON
AND DOES THE READER REMEMBER A FEW PAGES BACK THE CALCULATIONS OF A
QUOTED CORRESPONDENT WHEREBY THE ORE IS TO BE MINED AND SHIPPED ALL THE
WAY TO ENGLAND THE METALS EXTRACTED AND THE GOLD AND SILVER CONTENTS
RECEIVED BACK BY THE MINERS AS CLEAR PROFIT THE COPPER ANTIMONY AND
OTHER THINGS IN THE ORE BEING SUFFICIENT TO PAY ALL THE EXPENSES
INCURRED EVERYBODY'S HEAD WAS FULL OF SUCH CALCULATIONS AS THOSE
SUCH RAVING INSANITY RATHER
FEW PEOPLE TOOK WORK INTO THEIR
CALCULATIONS OR OUTLAY OF MONEY EITHER EXCEPT THE WORK AND EXPENDITURES
OF OTHER PEOPLE
WE NEVER TOUCHED OUR TUNNEL OR OUR SHAFT AGAIN
WHY BECAUSE WE JUDGED
THAT WE HAD LEARNED THE REAL SECRET OF SUCCESS IN SILVER MINING WHICH
WAS NOT TO MINE THE SILVER OURSELVES BY THE SWEAT OF OUR BROWS AND THE
LABOR OF OUR HANDS BUT TO SELL THE LEDGES TO THE DULL SLAVES OF TOIL AND
LET THEM DO THE MINING
BEFORE LEAVING CARSON THE SECRETARY AND I HAD PURCHASED FEET FROM
VARIOUS ESMERALDA STRAGGLERS
WE HAD EXPECTED IMMEDIATE RETURNS OF
BULLION BUT WERE ONLY AFFLICTED WITH REGULAR AND CONSTANT ASSESSMENTS
INSTEAD DEMANDS FOR MONEY WHEREWITH TO DEVELOP THE SAID MINES
THESE
ASSESSMENTS HAD GROWN SO OPPRESSIVE THAT IT SEEMED NECESSARY TO LOOK INTO
THE MATTER PERSONALLY
THEREFORE I PROJECTED A PILGRIMAGE TO CARSON AND
THENCE TO ESMERALDA
I BOUGHT A HORSE AND STARTED IN COMPANY WITH
MR
BALLOU AND A GENTLEMAN NAMED OLLENDORFF A PRUSSIAN NOT THE PARTY
WHO HAS INFLICTED SO MUCH SUFFERING ON THE WORLD WITH HIS WRETCHED
FOREIGN GRAMMARS WITH THEIR INTERMINABLE REPETITIONS OF QUESTIONS WHICH
NEVER HAVE OCCURRED AND ARE NEVER LIKELY TO OCCUR IN ANY CONVERSATION
AMONG HUMAN BEINGS
WE RODE THROUGH A SNOW STORM FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS
AND ARRIVED AT HONEY LAKE SMITH'S A SORT OF ISOLATED INN ON THE CARSON
RIVER
IT WAS A TWO STORY LOG HOUSE SITUATED ON A SMALL KNOLL IN THE
MIDST OF THE VAST BASIN OR DESERT THROUGH WHICH THE SICKLY CARSON WINDS
ITS MELANCHOLY WAY
CLOSE TO THE HOUSE WERE THE OVERLAND STAGE STABLES
BUILT OF SUN DRIED BRICKS
THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER BUILDING WITHIN SEVERAL
LEAGUES OF THE PLACE
TOWARDS SUNSET ABOUT TWENTY HAY WAGONS ARRIVED AND
CAMPED AROUND THE HOUSE AND ALL THE TEAMSTERS CAME IN TO SUPPER A VERY
VERY ROUGH SET
THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OVERLAND STAGE DRIVERS THERE
ALSO AND HALF A DOZEN VAGABONDS AND STRAGGLERS CONSEQUENTLY THE HOUSE
WAS WELL CROWDED
WE WALKED OUT AFTER SUPPER AND VISITED A SMALL INDIAN CAMP IN THE
VICINITY
THE INDIANS WERE IN A GREAT HURRY ABOUT SOMETHING AND WERE
PACKING UP AND GETTING AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
IN THEIR BROKEN
ENGLISH THEY SAID BY'M BY HEAP WATER AND BY THE HELP OF SIGNS MADE
US UNDERSTAND THAT IN THEIR OPINION A FLOOD WAS COMING
THE WEATHER WAS
PERFECTLY CLEAR AND THIS WAS NOT THE RAINY SEASON
THERE WAS ABOUT A
FOOT OF WATER IN THE INSIGNIFICANT RIVER OR MAYBE TWO FEET THE STREAM
WAS NOT WIDER THAN A BACK ALLEY IN A VILLAGE AND ITS BANKS WERE SCARCELY
HIGHER THAN A MAN'S HEAD
SO WHERE WAS THE FLOOD TO COME FROM WE CANVASSED THE SUBJECT AWHILE
AND THEN CONCLUDED IT WAS A RUSE AND THAT THE INDIANS HAD SOME BETTER
REASON FOR LEAVING IN A HURRY THAN FEARS OF A FLOOD IN SUCH AN
EXCEEDINGLY DRY TIME
AT SEVEN IN THE EVENING WE WENT TO BED IN THE SECOND STORY WITH OUR
CLOTHES ON AS USUAL AND ALL THREE IN THE SAME BED FOR EVERY AVAILABLE
SPACE ON THE FLOORS CHAIRS ETC WAS IN REQUEST AND EVEN THEN THERE
WAS BARELY ROOM FOR THE HOUSING OF THE INN'S GUESTS
AN HOUR LATER WE
WERE AWAKENED BY A GREAT TURMOIL AND SPRINGING OUT OF BED WE PICKED OUR
WAY NIMBLY AMONG THE RANKS OF SNORING TEAMSTERS ON THE FLOOR AND GOT TO
THE FRONT WINDOWS OF THE LONG ROOM
A GLANCE REVEALED A STRANGE
SPECTACLE UNDER THE MOONLIGHT
THE CROOKED CARSON WAS FULL TO THE BRIM
AND ITS WATERS WERE RAGING AND FOAMING IN THE WILDEST WAY SWEEPING
AROUND THE SHARP BENDS AT A FURIOUS SPEED AND BEARING ON THEIR SURFACE A
CHAOS OF LOGS BRUSH AND ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH
A DEPRESSION WHERE ITS
BED HAD ONCE BEEN IN OTHER TIMES WAS ALREADY FILLING AND IN ONE OR TWO
PLACES THE WATER WAS BEGINNING TO WASH OVER THE MAIN BANK
MEN WERE
FLYING HITHER AND THITHER BRINGING CATTLE AND WAGONS CLOSE UP TO THE
HOUSE FOR THE SPOT OF HIGH GROUND ON WHICH IT STOOD EXTENDED ONLY SOME
THIRTY FEET IN FRONT AND ABOUT A HUNDRED IN THE REAR
CLOSE TO THE OLD
RIVER BED JUST SPOKEN OF STOOD A LITTLE LOG STABLE AND IN THIS OUR
HORSES WERE LODGED
WHILE WE LOOKED THE WATERS INCREASED SO FAST IN THIS PLACE THAT IN A FEW
MINUTES A TORRENT WAS ROARING BY THE LITTLE STABLE AND ITS MARGIN
ENCROACHING STEADILY ON THE LOGS
WE SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT THIS FLOOD
WAS NOT A MERE HOLIDAY SPECTACLE BUT MEANT DAMAGE AND NOT ONLY TO THE
SMALL LOG STABLE BUT TO THE OVERLAND BUILDINGS CLOSE TO THE MAIN RIVER
FOR THE WAVES HAD NOW COME ASHORE AND WERE CREEPING ABOUT THE FOUNDATIONS
AND INVADING THE GREAT HAY CORRAL ADJOINING
WE RAN DOWN AND JOINED THE
CROWD OF EXCITED MEN AND FRIGHTENED ANIMALS
WE WADED KNEE DEEP INTO THE
LOG STABLE UNFASTENED THE HORSES AND WADED OUT ALMOST WAIST DEEP SO
FAST THE WATERS INCREASED
THEN THE CROWD RUSHED IN A BODY TO THE
HAY CORRAL AND BEGAN TO TUMBLE DOWN THE HUGE STACKS OF BALED HAY AND ROLL
THE BALES UP ON THE HIGH GROUND BY THE HOUSE
MEANTIME IT WAS DISCOVERED
THAT OWENS AN OVERLAND DRIVER WAS MISSING AND A MAN RAN TO THE LARGE
STABLE AND WADING IN BOOT TOP DEEP DISCOVERED HIM ASLEEP IN HIS BED
AWOKE HIM AND WADED OUT AGAIN
BUT OWENS WAS DROWSY AND RESUMED HIS
NAP BUT ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOR PRESENTLY HE TURNED IN HIS BED
HIS HAND DROPPED OVER THE SIDE AND CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE COLD WATER
IT WAS UP LEVEL WITH THE MATTRESS HE WADED OUT BREAST DEEP ALMOST
AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE SUN BURNED BRICKS MELTED DOWN LIKE SUGAR AND THE
BIG BUILDING CRUMBLED TO A RUIN AND WAS WASHED AWAY IN A TWINKLING
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ONLY THE ROOF OF THE LITTLE LOG STABLE WAS OUT OF
WATER AND OUR INN WAS ON AN ISLAND IN MID OCEAN
AS FAR AS THE EYE
COULD REACH IN THE MOONLIGHT THERE WAS NO DESERT VISIBLE BUT ONLY A
LEVEL WASTE OF SHINING WATER
THE INDIANS WERE TRUE PROPHETS BUT HOW
DID THEY GET THEIR INFORMATION I AM NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
WE REMAINED COOPED UP EIGHT DAYS AND NIGHTS WITH THAT CURIOUS CREW
SWEARING DRINKING AND CARD PLAYING WERE THE ORDER OF THE DAY AND
OCCASIONALLY A FIGHT WAS THROWN IN FOR VARIETY
DIRT AND VERMIN BUT LET
US FORGET THOSE FEATURES THEIR PROFUSION IS SIMPLY INCONCEIVABLE IT IS
BETTER THAT THEY REMAIN SO
THERE WERE TWO MEN HOWEVER THIS CHAPTER IS LONG ENOUGH
CHAPTER XXXI
THERE WERE TWO MEN IN THE COMPANY WHO CAUSED ME PARTICULAR DISCOMFORT
ONE WAS A LITTLE SWEDE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD WHO KNEW ONLY ONE
SONG AND HE WAS FOREVER SINGING IT
BY DAY WE WERE ALL CROWDED INTO ONE
SMALL STIFLING BAR ROOM AND SO THERE WAS NO ESCAPING THIS PERSON'S
MUSIC
THROUGH ALL THE PROFANITY WHISKY GUZZLING OLD SLEDGE AND
QUARRELING HIS MONOTONOUS SONG MEANDERED WITH NEVER A VARIATION IN ITS
TIRESOME SAMENESS AND IT SEEMED TO ME AT LAST THAT I WOULD BE CONTENT
TO DIE IN ORDER TO BE RID OF THE TORTURE
THE OTHER MAN WAS A STALWART
RUFFIAN CALLED ARKANSAS WHO CARRIED TWO REVOLVERS IN HIS BELT AND A
BOWIE KNIFE PROJECTING FROM HIS BOOT AND WHO WAS ALWAYS DRUNK AND ALWAYS
SUFFERING FOR A FIGHT
BUT HE WAS SO FEARED THAT NOBODY WOULD
ACCOMMODATE HIM
HE WOULD TRY ALL MANNER OF LITTLE WARY RUSES TO ENTRAP
SOMEBODY INTO AN OFFENSIVE REMARK AND HIS FACE WOULD LIGHT UP NOW AND
THEN WHEN HE FANCIED HE WAS FAIRLY ON THE SCENT OF A FIGHT BUT
INVARIABLY HIS VICTIM WOULD ELUDE HIS TOILS AND THEN HE WOULD SHOW A
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT WAS ALMOST PATHETIC
THE LANDLORD JOHNSON WAS A
MEEK WELL MEANING FELLOW AND ARKANSAS FASTENED ON HIM EARLY AS A
PROMISING SUBJECT AND GAVE HIM NO REST DAY OR NIGHT FOR AWHILE
ON THE
FOURTH MORNING ARKANSAS GOT DRUNK AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO WAIT FOR AN
OPPORTUNITY
PRESENTLY JOHNSON CAME IN JUST COMFORTABLY SOCIABLE WITH
WHISKY AND SAID
I RECKON THE PENNSYLVANIA 'LECTION
ARKANSAS RAISED HIS FINGER IMPRESSIVELY AND JOHNSON STOPPED
ARKANSAS
ROSE UNSTEADILY AND CONFRONTED HIM
SAID HE
WHA WHAT DO YOU KNOW A ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA ANSWER ME THAT
WHA WHAT
DO YOU KNOW 'BOUT PENNSYLVANIA
I WAS ONLY GOIN' TO SAY
YOU WAS ONLY GOIN' TO SAY
YOU WAS YOU WAS ONLY GOIN' TO SAY WHAT
WAS YOU GOIN' TO SAY THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
I WANT TO
KNOW WHA WHAT YOU 'IC WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA SINCE YOU'RE
MAKIN' YOURSELF SO D D FREE
ANSWER ME THAT
MR
ARKANSAS IF YOU'D ONLY LET ME
WHO'S A HENDERIN' YOU DON'T YOU INSINUATE NOTHING AGIN ME DON'T YOU
DO IT
DON'T YOU COME IN HERE BULLYIN' AROUND AND CUSSIN' AND GOIN' ON
LIKE A LUNATIC DON'T YOU DO IT
'COZ I WON'T STAND IT
IF FIGHT'S WHAT
YOU WANT OUT WITH IT I'M YOUR MAN OUT WITH IT
SAID JOHNSON BACKING INTO A CORNER ARKANSAS FOLLOWING MENACINGLY
WHY I NEVER SAID NOTHING MR
ARKANSAS
YOU DON'T GIVE A MAN NO
CHANCE
I WAS ONLY GOIN' TO SAY THAT PENNSYLVANIA WAS GOIN' TO HAVE AN
ELECTION NEXT WEEK THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS EVERYTHING I WAS GOIN' TO SAY
I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF IT WASN'T
WELL THEN WHY D'N'T YOU SAY IT WHAT DID YOU COME SWELLIN' AROUND THAT
WAY FOR AND TRYIN' TO RAISE TROUBLE
WHY I DIDN'T COME SWELLIN' AROUND MR
ARKANSAS I JUST
I'M A LIAR AM I GER REAT CAESAR'S GHOST
OH PLEASE MR
ARKANSAS I NEVER MEANT SUCH A THING AS THAT I WISH I
MAY DIE IF I DID
ALL THE BOYS WILL TELL YOU THAT I'VE ALWAYS SPOKE WELL
OF YOU AND RESPECTED YOU MORE'N ANY MAN IN THE HOUSE
ASK SMITH
AIN'T
IT SO SMITH DIDN'T I SAY NO LONGER AGO THAN LAST NIGHT THAT FOR A
MAN THAT WAS A GENTLEMAN ALL THE TIME AND EVERY WAY YOU TOOK HIM GIVE ME
ARKANSAS I'LL LEAVE IT TO ANY GENTLEMAN HERE IF THEM WARN'T THE VERY
WORDS I USED
COME NOW MR
ARKANSAS LE'S TAKE A DRINK LE'S SHAKE
HANDS AND TAKE A DRINK
COME UP EVERYBODY IT'S MY TREAT
COME UP
BILL TOM BOB SCOTTY COME UP
I WANT YOU ALL TO TAKE A DRINK WITH ME
AND ARKANSAS OLD ARKANSAS I CALL HIM BULLY OLD ARKANSAS
GIMME YOUR
HAND AGIN
LOOK AT HIM BOYS JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HIM
THAR STANDS THE
WHITEST MAN IN AMERICA AND THE MAN THAT DENIES IT HAS GOT TO FIGHT ME
THAT'S ALL
GIMME THAT OLD FLIPPER AGIN
THEY EMBRACED WITH DRUNKEN AFFECTION ON THE LANDLORD'S PART AND
UNRESPONSIVE TOLERATION ON THE PART OF ARKANSAS WHO BRIBED BY A DRINK
WAS DISAPPOINTED OF HIS PREY ONCE MORE
BUT THE FOOLISH LANDLORD WAS SO
HAPPY TO HAVE ESCAPED BUTCHERY THAT HE WENT ON TALKING WHEN HE OUGHT TO
HAVE MARCHED HIMSELF OUT OF DANGER
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT ARKANSAS
SHORTLY BEGAN TO GLOWER UPON HIM DANGEROUSLY AND PRESENTLY SAID
LAN'LORD WILL YOU P PLEASE MAKE THAT REMARK OVER AGIN IF YOU PLEASE
I WAS A SAYIN' TO SCOTTY THAT MY FATHER WAS UP'ARDS OF EIGHTY YEAR OLD
WHEN HE DIED
WAS THAT ALL THAT YOU SAID
YES THAT WAS ALL
DIDN'T SAY NOTHING BUT THAT
NO NOTHING
THEN AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE
ARKANSAS PLAYED WITH HIS GLASS A MOMENT LOLLING ON HIS ELBOWS ON THE
COUNTER
THEN HE MEDITATIVELY SCRATCHED HIS LEFT SHIN WITH HIS RIGHT
BOOT WHILE THE AWKWARD SILENCE CONTINUED
BUT PRESENTLY HE LOAFED AWAY
TOWARD THE STOVE LOOKING DISSATISFIED ROUGHLY SHOULDERED TWO OR THREE
MEN OUT OF A COMFORTABLE POSITION OCCUPIED IT HIMSELF GAVE A SLEEPING
DOG A KICK THAT SENT HIM HOWLING UNDER A BENCH THEN SPREAD HIS LONG LEGS
AND HIS BLANKET COAT TAILS APART AND PROCEEDED TO WARM HIS BACK
IN A
LITTLE WHILE HE FELL TO GRUMBLING TO HIMSELF AND SOON HE SLOUCHED BACK
TO THE BAR AND SAID
LAN'LORD WHAT'S YOUR IDEA FOR RAKIN' UP OLD PERSONALITIES AND BLOWIN'
ABOUT YOUR FATHER AIN'T THIS COMPANY AGREEABLE TO YOU AIN'T IT IF
THIS COMPANY AIN'T AGREEABLE TO YOU P'R'APS WE'D BETTER LEAVE
IS THAT
YOUR IDEA IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE COMING AT
WHY BLESS YOUR SOUL ARKANSAS I WARN'T THINKING OF SUCH A THING
MY
FATHER AND MY MOTHER
LAN'LORD DON'T CROWD A MAN DON'T DO IT
IF NOTHING'LL DO YOU BUT A
DISTURBANCE OUT WITH IT LIKE A MAN 'IC BUT DON'T RAKE UP OLD BYGONES

WHITE LIVERED SON OF A NIGGER DRAW YOUR WEEPON
WITH THAT ARKANSAS BEGAN TO SHOOT AND THE LANDLORD TO CLAMBER OVER
BENCHES MEN AND EVERY SORT OF OBSTACLE IN A FRANTIC DESIRE TO ESCAPE
IN THE MIDST OF THE WILD HUBBUB THE LANDLORD CRASHED THROUGH A GLASS
DOOR AND AS ARKANSAS CHARGED AFTER HIM THE LANDLORD'S WIFE SUDDENLY
APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY AND CONFRONTED THE DESPERADO WITH A PAIR OF
SCISSORS HER FURY WAS MAGNIFICENT
WITH HEAD ERECT AND FLASHING EYE
SHE STOOD A MOMENT AND THEN ADVANCED WITH HER WEAPON RAISED
THE
ASTONISHED RUFFIAN HESITATED AND THEN FELL BACK A STEP
SHE FOLLOWED
SHE BACKED HIM STEP BY STEP INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE BAR ROOM AND THEN
WHILE THE WONDERING CROWD CLOSED UP AND GAZED SHE GAVE HIM SUCH ANOTHER
TONGUE LASHING AS NEVER A COWED AND SHAMEFACED BRAGGART GOT BEFORE
PERHAPS AS SHE FINISHED AND RETIRED VICTORIOUS A ROAR OF APPLAUSE
SHOOK THE HOUSE AND EVERY MAN ORDERED DRINKS FOR THE CROWD IN ONE AND
THE SAME BREATH
THE LESSON WAS ENTIRELY SUFFICIENT
THE REIGN OF TERROR WAS OVER AND
THE ARKANSAS DOMINATION BROKEN FOR GOOD
DURING THE REST OF THE SEASON
OF ISLAND CAPTIVITY THERE WAS ONE MAN WHO SAT APART IN A STATE OF
PERMANENT HUMILIATION NEVER MIXING IN ANY QUARREL OR UTTERING A BOAST
AND NEVER RESENTING THE INSULTS THE ONCE CRINGING CREW NOW CONSTANTLY
LEVELED AT HIM AND THAT MAN WAS ARKANSAS
BY THE FIFTH OR SIXTH MORNING THE WATERS HAD SUBSIDED FROM THE LAND BUT
THE STREAM IN THE OLD RIVER BED WAS STILL HIGH AND SWIFT AND THERE WAS NO
POSSIBILITY OF CROSSING IT
ON THE EIGHTH IT WAS STILL TOO HIGH FOR AN
ENTIRELY SAFE PASSAGE BUT LIFE IN THE INN HAD BECOME NEXT TO
INSUPPORTABLE BY REASON OF THE DIRT DRUNKENNESS FIGHTING ETC AND SO
WE MADE AN EFFORT TO GET AWAY
IN THE MIDST OF A HEAVY SNOW STORM WE
EMBARKED IN A CANOE TAKING OUR SADDLES ABOARD AND TOWING OUR HORSES
AFTER US BY THEIR HALTERS
THE PRUSSIAN OLLENDORFF WAS IN THE BOW
WITH A PADDLE BALLOU PADDLED IN THE MIDDLE AND I SAT IN THE STERN
HOLDING THE HALTERS
WHEN THE HORSES LOST THEIR FOOTING AND BEGAN TO
SWIM OLLENDORFF GOT FRIGHTENED FOR THERE WAS GREAT DANGER THAT THE
HORSES WOULD MAKE OUR AIM UNCERTAIN AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT IF WE FAILED
TO LAND AT A CERTAIN SPOT THE CURRENT WOULD THROW US OFF AND ALMOST
SURELY CAST US INTO THE MAIN CARSON WHICH WAS A BOILING TORRENT NOW
SUCH A CATASTROPHE WOULD BE DEATH IN ALL PROBABILITY FOR WE WOULD BE
SWEPT TO SEA IN THE SINK OR OVERTURNED AND DROWNED
WE WARNED
OLLENDORFF TO KEEP HIS WITS ABOUT HIM AND HANDLE HIMSELF CAREFULLY BUT
IT WAS USELESS THE MOMENT THE BOW TOUCHED THE BANK HE MADE A SPRING AND
THE CANOE WHIRLED UPSIDE DOWN IN TEN FOOT WATER
OLLENDORFF SEIZED SOME BRUSH AND DRAGGED HIMSELF ASHORE BUT BALLOU AND I
HAD TO SWIM FOR IT ENCUMBERED WITH OUR OVERCOATS
BUT WE HELD ON TO THE
CANOE AND ALTHOUGH WE WERE WASHED DOWN NEARLY TO THE CARSON WE MANAGED
TO PUSH THE BOAT ASHORE AND MAKE A SAFE LANDING
WE WERE COLD AND
WATER SOAKED BUT SAFE
THE HORSES MADE A LANDING TOO BUT OUR SADDLES
WERE GONE OF COURSE
WE TIED THE ANIMALS IN THE SAGE BRUSH AND THERE
THEY HAD TO STAY FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
WE BALED OUT THE CANOE AND
FERRIED OVER SOME FOOD AND BLANKETS FOR THEM BUT WE SLEPT ONE MORE NIGHT
IN THE INN BEFORE MAKING ANOTHER VENTURE ON OUR JOURNEY
THE NEXT MORNING IT WAS STILL SNOWING FURIOUSLY WHEN WE GOT AWAY WITH OUR
NEW STOCK OF SADDLES AND ACCOUTREMENTS
WE MOUNTED AND STARTED
THE
SNOW LAY SO DEEP ON THE GROUND THAT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A ROAD
PERCEPTIBLE AND THE SNOW FALL WAS SO THICK THAT WE COULD NOT SEE MORE
THAN A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD ELSE WE COULD HAVE GUIDED OUR COURSE BY THE
MOUNTAIN RANGES
THE CASE LOOKED DUBIOUS BUT OLLENDORFF SAID HIS
INSTINCT WAS AS SENSITIVE AS ANY COMPASS AND THAT HE COULD STRIKE A
BEE LINE FOR CARSON CITY AND NEVER DIVERGE FROM IT
HE SAID THAT IF HE
WERE TO STRAGGLE A SINGLE POINT OUT OF THE TRUE LINE HIS INSTINCT WOULD
ASSAIL HIM LIKE AN OUTRAGED CONSCIENCE
CONSEQUENTLY WE DROPPED INTO HIS
WAKE HAPPY AND CONTENT
FOR HALF AN HOUR WE POKED ALONG WARILY ENOUGH
BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME WE CAME UPON A FRESH TRAIL AND OLLENDORFF
SHOUTED PROUDLY
I KNEW I WAS AS DEAD CERTAIN AS A COMPASS BOYS HERE WE ARE RIGHT IN
SOMEBODY'S TRACKS THAT WILL HUNT THE WAY FOR US WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
LET'S HURRY UP AND JOIN COMPANY WITH THE PARTY
SO WE PUT THE HORSES INTO AS MUCH OF A TROT AS THE DEEP SNOW WOULD ALLOW
AND BEFORE LONG IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GAINING ON OUR PREDECESSORS
FOR THE TRACKS GREW MORE DISTINCT
WE HURRIED ALONG AND AT THE END OF
AN HOUR THE TRACKS LOOKED STILL NEWER AND FRESHER BUT WHAT SURPRISED US
WAS THAT THE NUMBER OF TRAVELERS IN ADVANCE OF US SEEMED TO STEADILY
INCREASE
WE WONDERED HOW SO LARGE A PARTY CAME TO BE TRAVELING AT SUCH
A TIME AND IN SUCH A SOLITUDE
SOMEBODY SUGGESTED THAT IT MUST BE A
COMPANY OF SOLDIERS FROM THE FORT AND SO WE ACCEPTED THAT SOLUTION AND
JOGGED ALONG A LITTLE FASTER STILL FOR THEY COULD NOT BE FAR OFF NOW
BUT THE TRACKS STILL MULTIPLIED AND WE BEGAN TO THINK THE PLATOON OF
SOLDIERS WAS MIRACULOUSLY EXPANDING INTO A REGIMENT BALLOU SAID THEY HAD
ALREADY INCREASED TO FIVE HUNDRED PRESENTLY HE STOPPED HIS HORSE AND
SAID
BOYS THESE ARE OUR OWN TRACKS AND WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN CIRCUSSING ROUND
AND ROUND IN A CIRCLE FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OUT HERE IN THIS BLIND
DESERT BY GEORGE THIS IS PERFECTLY HYDRAULIC
THEN THE OLD MAN WAXED WROTH AND ABUSIVE
HE CALLED OLLENDORFF ALL
MANNER OF HARD NAMES SAID HE NEVER SAW SUCH A LURID FOOL AS HE WAS AND
ENDED WITH THE PECULIARLY VENOMOUS OPINION THAT HE DID NOT KNOW AS MUCH
AS A LOGARYTHM
WE CERTAINLY HAD BEEN FOLLOWING OUR OWN TRACKS
OLLENDORFF AND HIS
MENTAL COMPASS WERE IN DISGRACE FROM THAT MOMENT
AFTER ALL OUR HARD TRAVEL HERE WE WERE ON THE BANK OF THE STREAM AGAIN
WITH THE INN BEYOND DIMLY OUTLINED THROUGH THE DRIVING SNOW FALL
WHILE
WE WERE CONSIDERING WHAT TO DO THE YOUNG SWEDE LANDED FROM THE CANOE AND
TOOK HIS PEDESTRIAN WAY CARSON WARDS SINGING HIS SAME TIRESOME SONG
ABOUT HIS SISTER AND HIS BROTHER AND THE CHILD IN THE GRAVE WITH ITS
MOTHER AND IN A SHORT MINUTE FADED AND DISAPPEARED IN THE WHITE
OBLIVION
HE WAS NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN
HE NO DOUBT GOT BEWILDERED AND
LOST AND FATIGUE DELIVERED HIM OVER TO SLEEP AND SLEEP BETRAYED HIM TO
DEATH
POSSIBLY HE FOLLOWED OUR TREACHEROUS TRACKS TILL HE BECAME
EXHAUSTED AND DROPPED
PRESENTLY THE OVERLAND STAGE FORDED THE NOW FAST RECEDING STREAM AND
STARTED TOWARD CARSON ON ITS FIRST TRIP SINCE THE FLOOD CAME
WE
HESITATED NO LONGER NOW BUT TOOK UP OUR MARCH IN ITS WAKE AND TROTTED
MERRILY ALONG FOR WE HAD GOOD CONFIDENCE IN THE DRIVER'S BUMP OF
LOCALITY
BUT OUR HORSES WERE NO MATCH FOR THE FRESH STAGE TEAM
WE
WERE SOON LEFT OUT OF SIGHT BUT IT WAS NO MATTER FOR WE HAD THE DEEP
RUTS THE WHEELS MADE FOR A GUIDE
BY THIS TIME IT WAS THREE IN THE
AFTERNOON AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE NIGHT CAME AND
NOT WITH A LINGERING TWILIGHT BUT WITH A SUDDEN SHUTTING DOWN LIKE A
CELLAR DOOR AS IS ITS HABIT IN THAT COUNTRY
THE SNOWFALL WAS STILL AS
THICK AS EVER AND OF COURSE WE COULD NOT SEE FIFTEEN STEPS BEFORE US
BUT ALL ABOUT US THE WHITE GLARE OF THE SNOW BED ENABLED US TO DISCERN
THE SMOOTH SUGAR LOAF MOUNDS MADE BY THE COVERED SAGE BUSHES AND JUST IN
FRONT OF US THE TWO FAINT GROOVES WHICH WE KNEW WERE THE STEADILY FILLING
AND SLOWLY DISAPPEARING WHEEL TRACKS
NOW THOSE SAGE BUSHES WERE ALL ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT THREE OR FOUR FEET
THEY STOOD JUST ABOUT SEVEN FEET APART ALL OVER THE VAST DESERT EACH OF
THEM WAS A MERE SNOW MOUND NOW IN ANY DIRECTION THAT YOU PROCEEDED THE
SAME AS IN A WELL LAID OUT ORCHARD YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF MOVING DOWN A
DISTINCTLY DEFINED AVENUE WITH A ROW OF THESE SNOW MOUNDS AN EITHER SIDE
OF IT AN AVENUE THE CUSTOMARY WIDTH OF A ROAD NICE AND LEVEL IN ITS
BREADTH AND RISING AT THE SIDES IN THE MOST NATURAL WAY BY REASON OF
THE MOUNDS
BUT WE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THIS
THEN IMAGINE THE CHILLY
THRILL THAT SHOT THROUGH US WHEN IT FINALLY OCCURRED TO US FAR IN THE
NIGHT THAT SINCE THE LAST FAINT TRACE OF THE WHEEL TRACKS HAD LONG AGO
BEEN BURIED FROM SIGHT WE MIGHT NOW BE WANDERING DOWN A MERE SAGE BRUSH
AVENUE MILES AWAY FROM THE ROAD AND DIVERGING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY
FROM IT ALL THE TIME
HAVING A CAKE OF ICE SLIPPED DOWN ONE'S BACK IS
PLACID COMFORT COMPARED TO IT
THERE WAS A SUDDEN LEAP AND STIR OF BLOOD
THAT HAD BEEN ASLEEP FOR AN HOUR AND AS SUDDEN A ROUSING OF ALL THE
DROWSING ACTIVITIES IN OUR MINDS AND BODIES
WE WERE ALIVE AND AWAKE AT
ONCE AND SHAKING AND QUAKING WITH CONSTERNATION TOO
THERE WAS AN
INSTANT HALTING AND DISMOUNTING A BENDING LOW AND AN ANXIOUS SCANNING OF
THE ROAD BED
USELESS OF COURSE FOR IF A FAINT DEPRESSION COULD NOT BE
DISCERNED FROM AN ALTITUDE OF FOUR OR FIVE FEET ABOVE IT IT CERTAINLY
COULD NOT WITH ONE'S NOSE NEARLY AGAINST IT
CHAPTER XXXII
WE SEEMED TO BE IN A ROAD BUT THAT WAS NO PROOF
WE TESTED THIS BY
WALKING OFF IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS THE REGULAR SNOW MOUNDS AND THE
REGULAR AVENUES BETWEEN THEM CONVINCED EACH MAN THAT HE HAD FOUND THE
TRUE ROAD AND THAT THE OTHERS HAD FOUND ONLY FALSE ONES
PLAINLY THE
SITUATION WAS DESPERATE
WE WERE COLD AND STIFF AND THE HORSES WERE
TIRED
WE DECIDED TO BUILD A SAGE BRUSH FIRE AND CAMP OUT TILL MORNING
THIS WAS WISE BECAUSE IF WE WERE WANDERING FROM THE RIGHT ROAD AND THE
SNOW STORM CONTINUED ANOTHER DAY OUR CASE WOULD BE THE NEXT THING TO
HOPELESS IF WE KEPT ON
ALL AGREED THAT A CAMP FIRE WAS WHAT WOULD COME NEAREST TO SAVING US
NOW AND SO WE SET ABOUT BUILDING IT
WE COULD FIND NO MATCHES AND SO
WE TRIED TO MAKE SHIFT WITH THE PISTOLS
NOT A MAN IN THE PARTY HAD EVER
TRIED TO DO SUCH A THING BEFORE BUT NOT A MAN IN THE PARTY DOUBTED THAT
IT COULD BE DONE AND WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE BECAUSE EVERY MAN IN THE PARTY
HAD READ ABOUT IT IN BOOKS MANY A TIME AND HAD NATURALLY COME TO BELIEVE
IT WITH TRUSTING SIMPLICITY JUST AS HE HAD LONG AGO ACCEPTED AND
BELIEVED THAT OTHER COMMON BOOK FRAUD ABOUT INDIANS AND LOST HUNTERS
MAKING A FIRE BY RUBBING TWO DRY STICKS TOGETHER
WE HUDDLED TOGETHER ON OUR KNEES IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THE HORSES PUT
THEIR NOSES TOGETHER AND BOWED THEIR PATIENT HEADS OVER US AND WHILE THE
FEATHERY FLAKES EDDIED DOWN AND TURNED US INTO A GROUP OF WHITE STATUARY
WE PROCEEDED WITH THE MOMENTOUS EXPERIMENT
WE BROKE TWIGS FROM A SAGE
BUSH AND PILED THEM ON A LITTLE CLEARED PLACE IN THE SHELTER OF OUR
BODIES
IN THE COURSE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES ALL WAS READY AND THEN
WHILE CONVERSATION CEASED AND OUR PULSES BEAT LOW WITH ANXIOUS SUSPENSE
OLLENDORFF APPLIED HIS REVOLVER PULLED THE TRIGGER AND BLEW THE PILE
CLEAR OUT OF THE COUNTY IT WAS THE FLATTEST FAILURE THAT EVER WAS
THIS WAS DISTRESSING BUT IT PALED BEFORE A GREATER HORROR THE HORSES
WERE GONE I HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO HOLD THE BRIDLES BUT IN MY ABSORBING
ANXIETY OVER THE PISTOL EXPERIMENT I HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY DROPPED THEM AND
THE RELEASED ANIMALS HAD WALKED OFF IN THE STORM
IT WAS USELESS TO TRY
TO FOLLOW THEM FOR THEIR FOOTFALLS COULD MAKE NO SOUND AND ONE COULD
PASS WITHIN TWO YARDS OF THE CREATURES AND NEVER SEE THEM
WE GAVE THEM
UP WITHOUT AN EFFORT AT RECOVERING THEM AND CURSED THE LYING BOOKS THAT
SAID HORSES WOULD STAY BY THEIR MASTERS FOR PROTECTION AND COMPANIONSHIP
IN A DISTRESSFUL TIME LIKE OURS
WE WERE MISERABLE ENOUGH BEFORE WE FELT STILL MORE FORLORN NOW
PATIENTLY BUT WITH BLIGHTED HOPE WE BROKE MORE STICKS AND PILED THEM
AND ONCE MORE THE PRUSSIAN SHOT THEM INTO ANNIHILATION
PLAINLY TO
LIGHT A FIRE WITH A PISTOL WAS AN ART REQUIRING PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
AND THE MIDDLE OF A DESERT AT MIDNIGHT IN A SNOW STORM WAS NOT A GOOD
PLACE OR TIME FOR THE ACQUIRING OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENT
WE GAVE IT UP AND
TRIED THE OTHER
EACH MAN TOOK A COUPLE OF STICKS AND FELL TO CHAFING
THEM TOGETHER
AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR WE WERE THOROUGHLY CHILLED
AND SO WERE THE STICKS
WE BITTERLY EXECRATED THE INDIANS THE HUNTERS
AND THE BOOKS THAT HAD BETRAYED US WITH THE SILLY DEVICE AND WONDERED
DISMALLY WHAT WAS NEXT TO BE DONE
AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT MR
BALLOU
FISHED OUT FOUR MATCHES FROM THE RUBBISH OF AN OVERLOOKED POCKET
TO
HAVE FOUND FOUR GOLD BARS WOULD HAVE SEEMED POOR AND CHEAP GOOD LUCK
COMPARED TO THIS
ONE CANNOT THINK HOW GOOD A MATCH LOOKS UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES OR HOW
LOVABLE AND PRECIOUS AND SACREDLY BEAUTIFUL TO THE EYE
THIS TIME WE
GATHERED STICKS WITH HIGH HOPES AND WHEN MR
BALLOU PREPARED TO LIGHT
THE FIRST MATCH THERE WAS AN AMOUNT OF INTEREST CENTRED UPON HIM THAT
PAGES OF WRITING COULD NOT DESCRIBE
THE MATCH BURNED HOPEFULLY A
MOMENT AND THEN WENT OUT
IT COULD NOT HAVE CARRIED MORE REGRET WITH IT
IF IT HAD BEEN A HUMAN LIFE
THE NEXT MATCH SIMPLY FLASHED AND DIED
THE WIND PUFFED THE THIRD ONE OUT JUST AS IT WAS ON THE IMMINENT VERGE OF
SUCCESS
WE GATHERED TOGETHER CLOSER THAN EVER AND DEVELOPED A
SOLICITUDE THAT WAS RAPT AND PAINFUL AS MR
BALLOU SCRATCHED OUR LAST
HOPE ON HIS LEG
IT LIT BURNED BLUE AND SICKLY AND THEN BUDDED INTO A
ROBUST FLAME
SHADING IT WITH HIS HANDS THE OLD GENTLEMAN BENT
GRADUALLY DOWN AND EVERY HEART WENT WITH HIM EVERYBODY TOO FOR THAT
MATTER AND BLOOD AND BREATH STOOD STILL
THE FLAME TOUCHED THE STICKS
AT LAST TOOK GRADUAL HOLD UPON THEM HESITATED TOOK A STRONGER HOLD
HESITATED AGAIN HELD ITS BREATH FIVE HEART BREAKING SECONDS THEN GAVE A
SORT OF HUMAN GASP AND WENT OUT
NOBODY SAID A WORD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES
IT WAS A SOLEMN SORT OF SILENCE
EVEN THE WIND PUT ON A STEALTHY SINISTER QUIET AND MADE NO MORE NOISE
THAN THE FALLING FLAKES OF SNOW
FINALLY A SAD VOICED CONVERSATION
BEGAN AND IT WAS SOON APPARENT THAT IN EACH OF OUR HEARTS LAY THE
CONVICTION THAT THIS WAS OUR LAST NIGHT WITH THE LIVING
I HAD SO HOPED
THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO FELT SO
WHEN THE OTHERS CALMLY ACKNOWLEDGED
THEIR CONVICTION IT SOUNDED LIKE THE SUMMONS ITSELF
OLLENDORFF SAID
BROTHERS LET US DIE TOGETHER
AND LET US GO WITHOUT ONE HARD FEELING
TOWARDS EACH OTHER
LET US FORGET AND FORGIVE BYGONES
I KNOW THAT YOU
HAVE FELT HARD TOWARDS ME FOR TURNING OVER THE CANOE AND FOR KNOWING TOO
MUCH AND LEADING YOU ROUND AND ROUND IN THE SNOW BUT I MEANT WELL
FORGIVE ME
I ACKNOWLEDGE FREELY THAT I HAVE HAD HARD FEELINGS AGAINST
MR
BALLOU FOR ABUSING ME AND CALLING ME A LOGARYTHM WHICH IS A THING I
DO NOT KNOW WHAT BUT NO DOUBT A THING CONSIDERED DISGRACEFUL AND
UNBECOMING IN AMERICA AND IT HAS SCARCELY BEEN OUT OF MY MIND AND HAS
HURT ME A GREAT DEAL BUT LET IT GO I FORGIVE MR
BALLOU WITH ALL MY
HEART AND
POOR OLLENDORFF BROKE DOWN AND THE TEARS CAME
HE WAS NOT ALONE FOR I
WAS CRYING TOO AND SO WAS MR
BALLOU
OLLENDORFF GOT HIS VOICE AGAIN
AND FORGAVE ME FOR THINGS I HAD DONE AND SAID
THEN HE GOT OUT HIS
BOTTLE OF WHISKY AND SAID THAT WHETHER HE LIVED OR DIED HE WOULD NEVER
TOUCH ANOTHER DROP
HE SAID HE HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF LIFE AND
ALTHOUGH ILL PREPARED WAS READY TO SUBMIT HUMBLY TO HIS FATE THAT HE
WISHED HE COULD BE SPARED A LITTLE LONGER NOT FOR ANY SELFISH REASON
BUT TO MAKE A THOROUGH REFORM IN HIS CHARACTER AND BY DEVOTING HIMSELF
TO HELPING THE POOR NURSING THE SICK AND PLEADING WITH THE PEOPLE TO
GUARD THEMSELVES AGAINST THE EVILS OF INTEMPERANCE MAKE HIS LIFE A
BENEFICENT EXAMPLE TO THE YOUNG AND LAY IT DOWN AT LAST WITH THE
PRECIOUS REFLECTION THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN LIVED IN VAIN
HE ENDED BY
SAYING THAT HIS REFORM SHOULD BEGIN AT THIS MOMENT EVEN HERE IN THE
PRESENCE OF DEATH SINCE NO LONGER TIME WAS TO BE VOUCHSAFED WHEREIN TO
PROSECUTE IT TO MEN'S HELP AND BENEFIT AND WITH THAT HE THREW AWAY THE
BOTTLE OF WHISKY
MR
BALLOU MADE REMARKS OF SIMILAR PURPORT AND BEGAN THE REFORM HE COULD
NOT LIVE TO CONTINUE BY THROWING AWAY THE ANCIENT PACK OF CARDS THAT HAD
SOLACED OUR CAPTIVITY DURING THE FLOOD AND MADE IT BEARABLE
HE SAID HE NEVER GAMBLED BUT STILL WAS SATISFIED THAT THE MEDDLING WITH
CARDS IN ANY WAY WAS IMMORAL AND INJURIOUS AND NO MAN COULD BE WHOLLY
PURE AND BLEMISHLESS WITHOUT ESCHEWING THEM
AND THEREFORE CONTINUED
HE IN DOING THIS ACT I ALREADY FEEL MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THAT
SPIRITUAL SATURNALIA NECESSARY TO ENTIRE AND OBSOLETE REFORM THESE
ROLLING SYLLABLES TOUCHED HIM AS NO INTELLIGIBLE ELOQUENCE COULD HAVE
DONE AND THE OLD MAN SOBBED WITH A MOURNFULNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH
SATISFACTION
MY OWN REMARKS WERE OF THE SAME TENOR AS THOSE OF MY COMRADES AND I KNOW
THAT THE FEELINGS THAT PROMPTED THEM WERE HEARTFELT AND SINCERE
WE WERE
ALL SINCERE AND ALL DEEPLY MOVED AND EARNEST FOR WE WERE IN THE
PRESENCE OF DEATH AND WITHOUT HOPE
I THREW AWAY MY PIPE AND IN DOING
IT FELT THAT AT LAST I WAS FREE OF A HATED VICE AND ONE THAT HAD RIDDEN
ME LIKE A TYRANT ALL MY DAYS
WHILE I YET TALKED THE THOUGHT OF THE
GOOD I MIGHT HAVE DONE IN THE WORLD AND THE STILL GREATER GOOD I MIGHT
NOW DO WITH THESE NEW INCENTIVES AND HIGHER AND BETTER AIMS TO GUIDE ME
IF I COULD ONLY BE SPARED A FEW YEARS LONGER OVERCAME ME AND THE TEARS
CAME AGAIN
WE PUT OUR ARMS ABOUT EACH OTHER'S NECKS AND AWAITED THE
WARNING DROWSINESS THAT PRECEDES DEATH BY FREEZING
IT CAME STEALING OVER US PRESENTLY AND THEN WE BADE EACH OTHER A LAST
FAREWELL
A DELICIOUS DREAMINESS WROUGHT ITS WEB ABOUT MY YIELDING
SENSES WHILE THE SNOW FLAKES WOVE A WINDING SHEET ABOUT MY CONQUERED
BODY
OBLIVION CAME
THE BATTLE OF LIFE WAS DONE
CHAPTER XXXIII
I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG I WAS IN A STATE OF FORGETFULNESS BUT IT SEEMED
AN AGE
A VAGUE CONSCIOUSNESS GREW UPON ME BY DEGREES AND THEN CAME A
GATHERING ANGUISH OF PAIN IN MY LIMBS AND THROUGH ALL MY BODY
I
SHUDDERED
THE THOUGHT FLITTED THROUGH MY BRAIN THIS IS DEATH THIS IS
THE HEREAFTER
THEN CAME A WHITE UPHEAVAL AT MY SIDE AND A VOICE SAID WITH BITTERNESS
WILL SOME GENTLEMAN BE SO GOOD AS TO KICK ME BEHIND
IT WAS BALLOU AT LEAST IT WAS A TOWZLED SNOW IMAGE IN A SITTING POSTURE
WITH BALLOU'S VOICE
I ROSE UP AND THERE IN THE GRAY DAWN NOT FIFTEEN STEPS FROM US WERE
THE FRAME BUILDINGS OF A STAGE STATION AND UNDER A SHED STOOD OUR STILL
SADDLED AND BRIDLED HORSES
AN ARCHED SNOW DRIFT BROKE UP NOW AND OLLENDORFF EMERGED FROM IT AND
THE THREE OF US SAT AND STARED AT THE HOUSES WITHOUT SPEAKING A WORD
WE REALLY HAD NOTHING TO SAY
WE WERE LIKE THE PROFANE MAN WHO COULD NOT
DO THE SUBJECT JUSTICE THE WHOLE SITUATION WAS SO PAINFULLY RIDICULOUS
AND HUMILIATING THAT WORDS WERE TAME AND WE DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO
COMMENCE ANYHOW
THE JOY IN OUR HEARTS AT OUR DELIVERANCE WAS POISONED WELL NIGH
DISSIPATED INDEED
WE PRESENTLY BEGAN TO GROW PETTISH BY DEGREES AND
SULLEN AND THEN ANGRY AT EACH OTHER ANGRY AT OURSELVES ANGRY AT
EVERYTHING IN GENERAL WE MOODILY DUSTED THE SNOW FROM OUR CLOTHING AND
IN UNSOCIABLE SINGLE FILE PLOWED OUR WAY TO THE HORSES UNSADDLED THEM
AND SOUGHT SHELTER IN THE STATION
I HAVE SCARCELY EXAGGERATED A DETAIL OF THIS CURIOUS AND ABSURD
ADVENTURE
IT OCCURRED ALMOST EXACTLY AS I HAVE STATED IT
WE ACTUALLY
WENT INTO CAMP IN A SNOW DRIFT IN A DESERT AT MIDNIGHT IN A STORM
FORLORN AND HOPELESS WITHIN FIFTEEN STEPS OF A COMFORTABLE INN
FOR TWO HOURS WE SAT APART IN THE STATION AND RUMINATED IN DISGUST
THE MYSTERY WAS GONE NOW AND IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH WHY THE HORSES HAD
DESERTED US
WITHOUT A DOUBT THEY WERE UNDER THAT SHED A QUARTER OF A
MINUTE AFTER THEY HAD LEFT US AND THEY MUST HAVE OVERHEARD AND ENJOYED
ALL OUR CONFESSIONS AND LAMENTATIONS
AFTER BREAKFAST WE FELT BETTER AND THE ZEST OF LIFE SOON CAME BACK
THE WORLD LOOKED BRIGHT AGAIN AND EXISTENCE WAS AS DEAR TO US AS EVER
PRESENTLY AN UNEASINESS CAME OVER ME GREW UPON ME ASSAILED ME WITHOUT
CEASING
ALAS MY REGENERATION WAS NOT COMPLETE I WANTED TO SMOKE
I RESISTED WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT THE FLESH WAS WEAK
I WANDERED AWAY
ALONE AND WRESTLED WITH MYSELF AN HOUR
I RECALLED MY PROMISES OF REFORM
AND PREACHED TO MYSELF PERSUASIVELY UPBRAIDINGLY EXHAUSTIVELY
BUT IT
WAS ALL VAIN I SHORTLY FOUND MYSELF SNEAKING AMONG THE SNOW DRIFTS
HUNTING FOR MY PIPE
I DISCOVERED IT AFTER A CONSIDERABLE SEARCH AND
CREPT AWAY TO HIDE MYSELF AND ENJOY IT
I REMAINED BEHIND THE BARN A
GOOD WHILE ASKING MYSELF HOW I WOULD FEEL IF MY BRAVER STRONGER TRUER
COMRADES SHOULD CATCH ME IN MY DEGRADATION
AT LAST I LIT THE PIPE AND
NO HUMAN BEING CAN FEEL MEANER AND BASER THAN I DID THEN
I WAS ASHAMED
OF BEING IN MY OWN PITIFUL COMPANY
STILL DREADING DISCOVERY I FELT
THAT PERHAPS THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE BARN WOULD BE SOMEWHAT SAFER AND SO
I TURNED THE CORNER
AS I TURNED THE ONE CORNER SMOKING OLLENDORFF
TURNED THE OTHER WITH HIS BOTTLE TO HIS LIPS AND BETWEEN US SAT
UNCONSCIOUS BALLOU DEEP IN A GAME OF SOLITAIRE WITH THE OLD GREASY
CARDS
ABSURDITY COULD GO NO FARTHER
WE SHOOK HANDS AND AGREED TO SAY NO MORE
ABOUT REFORM AND EXAMPLES TO THE RISING GENERATION
THE STATION WE WERE AT WAS AT THE VERGE OF THE TWENTY SIX MILE DESERT
IF WE HAD APPROACHED IT HALF AN HOUR EARLIER THE NIGHT BEFORE WE MUST
HAVE HEARD MEN SHOUTING THERE AND FIRING PISTOLS FOR THEY WERE EXPECTING
SOME SHEEP DROVERS AND THEIR FLOCKS AND KNEW THAT THEY WOULD INFALLIBLY
GET LOST AND WANDER OUT OF REACH OF HELP UNLESS GUIDED BY SOUNDS
WHILE WE REMAINED AT THE STATION THREE OF THE DROVERS ARRIVED NEARLY
EXHAUSTED WITH THEIR WANDERINGS BUT TWO OTHERS OF THEIR PARTY WERE NEVER
HEARD OF AFTERWARD
WE REACHED CARSON IN DUE TIME AND TOOK A REST
THIS REST TOGETHER WITH
PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY TO ESMERALDA KEPT US THERE A WEEK AND THE
DELAY GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PRESENT AT THE TRIAL OF THE GREAT
LAND SLIDE CASE OF HYDE VS
MORGAN AN EPISODE WHICH IS FAMOUS IN NEVADA
TO THIS DAY
AFTER A WORD OR TWO OF NECESSARY EXPLANATION I WILL SET
DOWN THE HISTORY OF THIS SINGULAR AFFAIR JUST AS IT TRANSPIRED
CHAPTER XXXIV
THE MOUNTAINS ARE VERY HIGH AND STEEP ABOUT CARSON EAGLE AND WASHOE
VALLEYS VERY HIGH AND VERY STEEP AND SO WHEN THE SNOW GETS TO MELTING
OFF FAST IN THE SPRING AND THE WARM SURFACE EARTH BEGINS TO MOISTEN AND
SOFTEN THE DISASTROUS LAND SLIDES COMMENCE
THE READER CANNOT KNOW WHAT
A LAND SLIDE IS UNLESS HE HAS LIVED IN THAT COUNTRY AND SEEN THE WHOLE
SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN TAKEN OFF SOME FINE MORNING AND DEPOSITED DOWN IN THE
VALLEY LEAVING A VAST TREELESS UNSIGHTLY SCAR UPON THE MOUNTAIN'S
FRONT TO KEEP THE CIRCUMSTANCE FRESH IN HIS MEMORY ALL THE YEARS THAT HE
MAY GO ON LIVING WITHIN SEVENTY MILES OF THAT PLACE
GENERAL BUNCOMBE WAS SHIPPED OUT TO NEVADA IN THE INVOICE OF TERRITORIAL
OFFICERS TO BE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF A LAWYER
OF PARTS AND HE VERY MUCH WANTED AN OPPORTUNITY TO MANIFEST IT PARTLY
FOR THE PURE GRATIFICATION OF IT AND PARTLY BECAUSE HIS SALARY WAS
TERRITORIALLY MEAGRE WHICH IS A STRONG EXPRESSION
NOW THE OLDER
CITIZENS OF A NEW TERRITORY LOOK DOWN UPON THE REST OF THE WORLD WITH A
CALM BENEVOLENT COMPASSION AS LONG AS IT KEEPS OUT OF THE WAY WHEN IT
GETS IN THE WAY THEY SNUB IT
SOMETIMES THIS LATTER TAKES THE SHAPE OF A
PRACTICAL JOKE
ONE MORNING DICK HYDE RODE FURIOUSLY UP TO GENERAL BUNCOMBE'S DOOR IN
CARSON CITY AND RUSHED INTO HIS PRESENCE WITHOUT STOPPING TO TIE HIS
HORSE
HE SEEMED MUCH EXCITED
HE TOLD THE GENERAL THAT HE WANTED HIM
TO CONDUCT A SUIT FOR HIM AND WOULD PAY HIM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IF HE
ACHIEVED A VICTORY
AND THEN WITH VIOLENT GESTURES AND A WORLD OF
PROFANITY HE POURED OUT HIS GRIEF
HE SAID IT WAS PRETTY WELL KNOWN
THAT FOR SOME YEARS HE HAD BEEN FARMING OR RANCHING AS THE MORE
CUSTOMARY TERM IS IN WASHOE DISTRICT AND MAKING A SUCCESSFUL THING OF
IT AND FURTHERMORE IT WAS KNOWN THAT HIS RANCH WAS SITUATED JUST IN THE
EDGE OF THE VALLEY AND THAT TOM MORGAN OWNED A RANCH IMMEDIATELY ABOVE
IT ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
AND NOW THE TROUBLE WAS THAT ONE OF THOSE HATED AND DREADED LAND SLIDES
HAD COME AND SLID MORGAN'S RANCH FENCES CABINS CATTLE BARNS AND
EVERYTHING DOWN ON TOP OF HIS RANCH AND EXACTLY COVERED UP EVERY SINGLE
VESTIGE OF HIS PROPERTY TO A DEPTH OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT FEET
MORGAN
WAS IN POSSESSION AND REFUSED TO VACATE THE PREMISES SAID HE WAS
OCCUPYING HIS OWN CABIN AND NOT INTERFERING WITH ANYBODY ELSE'S AND SAID
THE CABIN WAS STANDING ON THE SAME DIRT AND SAME RANCH IT HAD ALWAYS
STOOD ON AND HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANYBODY MAKE HIM VACATE
AND WHEN I REMINDED HIM SAID HYDE WEEPING THAT IT WAS ON TOP OF MY
RANCH AND THAT HE WAS TRESPASSING HE HAD THE INFERNAL MEANNESS TO ASK ME
WHY DIDN'T I STAY ON MY RANCH AND HOLD POSSESSION WHEN I SEE HIM
A COMING WHY DIDN'T I STAY ON IT THE BLATHERING LUNATIC BY GEORGE
WHEN I HEARD THAT RACKET AND LOOKED UP THAT HILL IT WAS JUST LIKE THE
WHOLE WORLD WAS A RIPPING AND A TEARING DOWN THAT MOUNTAIN SIDE
SPLINTERS AND CORD WOOD THUNDER AND LIGHTNING HAIL AND SNOW ODDS AND
ENDS OF HAY STACKS AND AWFUL CLOUDS OF DUST TREES GOING END OVER END
IN THE AIR ROCKS AS BIG AS A HOUSE JUMPING 'BOUT A THOUSAND FEET HIGH
AND BUSTING INTO TEN MILLION PIECES CATTLE TURNED INSIDE OUT AND
A COMING HEAD ON WITH THEIR TAILS HANGING OUT BETWEEN THEIR TEETH AND
IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT WRACK AND DESTRUCTION SOT THAT CUSSED MORGAN ON
HIS GATE POST A WONDERING WHY I DIDN'T STAY AND HOLD POSSESSION LAWS
BLESS ME I JUST TOOK ONE GLIMPSE GENERAL AND LIT OUT'N THE COUNTY IN
THREE JUMPS EXACTLY
BUT WHAT GRINDS ME IS THAT THAT MORGAN HANGS ON THERE AND WON'T MOVE
OFF'N THAT RANCH SAYS IT'S HIS'N AND HE'S GOING TO KEEP IT LIKES IT
BETTER'N HE DID WHEN IT WAS HIGHER UP THE HILL
MAD WELL I'VE BEEN SO
MAD FOR TWO DAYS I COULDN'T FIND MY WAY TO TOWN BEEN WANDERING AROUND IN
THE BRUSH IN A STARVING CONDITION GOT ANYTHING HERE TO DRINK GENERAL
BUT I'M HERE NOW AND I'M A GOING TO LAW
YOU HEAR ME
NEVER IN ALL THE WORLD PERHAPS WERE A MAN'S FEELINGS SO OUTRAGED AS
WERE THE GENERAL'S
HE SAID HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH HIGH HANDED
CONDUCT IN ALL HIS LIFE AS THIS MORGAN'S
AND HE SAID THERE WAS NO USE
IN GOING TO LAW MORGAN HAD NO SHADOW OF RIGHT TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS
NOBODY IN THE WIDE WORLD WOULD UPHOLD HIM IN IT AND NO LAWYER WOULD TAKE
HIS CASE AND NO JUDGE LISTEN TO IT
HYDE SAID THAT RIGHT THERE WAS WHERE
HE WAS MISTAKEN EVERYBODY IN TOWN SUSTAINED MORGAN HAL BRAYTON A VERY
SMART LAWYER HAD TAKEN HIS CASE THE COURTS BEING IN VACATION IT WAS TO
BE TRIED BEFORE A REFEREE AND EX GOVERNOR ROOP HAD ALREADY BEEN
APPOINTED TO THAT OFFICE AND WOULD OPEN HIS COURT IN A LARGE PUBLIC HALL
NEAR THE HOTEL AT TWO THAT AFTERNOON
THE GENERAL WAS AMAZED
HE SAID HE HAD SUSPECTED BEFORE THAT THE PEOPLE
OF THAT TERRITORY WERE FOOLS AND NOW HE KNEW IT
BUT HE SAID REST EASY
REST EASY AND COLLECT THE WITNESSES FOR THE VICTORY WAS JUST AS CERTAIN
AS IF THE CONFLICT WERE ALREADY OVER
HYDE WIPED AWAY HIS TEARS AND
LEFT
AT TWO IN THE AFTERNOON REFEREE ROOP'S COURT OPENED AND ROOP APPEARED
THRONED AMONG HIS SHERIFFS THE WITNESSES AND SPECTATORS AND WEARING
UPON HIS FACE A SOLEMNITY SO AWE INSPIRING THAT SOME OF HIS
FELLOW CONSPIRATORS HAD MISGIVINGS THAT MAYBE HE HAD NOT COMPREHENDED
AFTER ALL THAT THIS WAS MERELY A JOKE
AN UNEARTHLY STILLNESS
PREVAILED FOR AT THE SLIGHTEST NOISE THE JUDGE UTTERED STERNLY THE
COMMAND
ORDER IN THE COURT
AND THE SHERIFFS PROMPTLY ECHOED IT
PRESENTLY THE GENERAL ELBOWED HIS
WAY THROUGH THE CROWD OF SPECTATORS WITH HIS ARMS FULL OF LAW BOOKS AND
ON HIS EARS FELL AN ORDER FROM THE JUDGE WHICH WAS THE FIRST RESPECTFUL
RECOGNITION OF HIS HIGH OFFICIAL DIGNITY THAT HAD EVER SALUTED THEM AND
IT TRICKLED PLEASANTLY THROUGH HIS WHOLE SYSTEM
WAY FOR THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY
THE WITNESSES WERE CALLED LEGISLATORS HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICERS
RANCHMEN MINERS INDIANS CHINAMEN NEGROES
THREE FOURTHS OF THEM WERE
CALLED BY THE DEFENDANT MORGAN BUT NO MATTER THEIR TESTIMONY INVARIABLY
WENT IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF HYDE
EACH NEW WITNESS ONLY ADDED NEW
TESTIMONY TO THE ABSURDITY OF A MAN'S CLAIMING TO OWN ANOTHER MAN'S
PROPERTY BECAUSE HIS FARM HAD SLID DOWN ON TOP OF IT
THEN THE MORGAN
LAWYERS MADE THEIR SPEECHES AND SEEMED TO MAKE SINGULARLY WEAK ONES
THEY DID REALLY NOTHING TO HELP THE MORGAN CAUSE
AND NOW THE GENERAL
WITH EXULTATION IN HIS FACE GOT UP AND MADE AN IMPASSIONED EFFORT HE
POUNDED THE TABLE HE BANGED THE LAW BOOKS HE SHOUTED AND ROARED AND
HOWLED HE QUOTED FROM EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY POETRY SARCASM
STATISTICS HISTORY PATHOS BATHOS BLASPHEMY AND WOUND UP WITH A GRAND
WAR WHOOP FOR FREE SPEECH FREEDOM OF THE PRESS FREE SCHOOLS THE
GLORIOUS BIRD OF AMERICA AND THE PRINCIPLES OF ETERNAL JUSTICE
APPLAUSE
WHEN THE GENERAL SAT DOWN HE DID IT WITH THE CONVICTION THAT IF THERE
WAS ANYTHING IN GOOD STRONG TESTIMONY A GREAT SPEECH AND BELIEVING AND
ADMIRING COUNTENANCES ALL AROUND MR
MORGAN'S CASE WAS KILLED
EX GOVERNOR ROOP LEANT HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND FOR SOME MINUTES THINKING
AND THE STILL AUDIENCE WAITED FOR HIS DECISION
THEN HE GOT UP AND STOOD
ERECT WITH BENDED HEAD AND THOUGHT AGAIN
THEN HE WALKED THE FLOOR
WITH LONG DELIBERATE STRIDES HIS CHIN IN HIS HAND AND STILL THE
AUDIENCE WAITED
AT LAST HE RETURNED TO HIS THRONE SEATED HIMSELF AND
BEGAN IMPRESSIVELY
GENTLEMEN I FEEL THE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY THAT RESTS UPON ME THIS DAY
THIS IS NO ORDINARY CASE
ON THE CONTRARY IT IS PLAIN THAT IT IS THE
MOST SOLEMN AND AWFUL THAT EVER MAN WAS CALLED UPON TO DECIDE
GENTLEMEN I HAVE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE EVIDENCE AND HAVE
PERCEIVED THAT THE WEIGHT OF IT THE OVERWHELMING WEIGHT OF IT IS IN
FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFF HYDE
I HAVE LISTENED ALSO TO THE REMARKS OF
COUNSEL WITH HIGH INTEREST AND ESPECIALLY WILL I COMMEND THE MASTERLY
AND IRREFUTABLE LOGIC OF THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN WHO REPRESENTS THE
PLAINTIFF
BUT GENTLEMEN LET US BEWARE HOW WE ALLOW MERE HUMAN
TESTIMONY HUMAN INGENUITY IN ARGUMENT AND HUMAN IDEAS OF EQUITY TO
INFLUENCE US AT A MOMENT SO SOLEMN AS THIS
GENTLEMEN IT ILL BECOMES
US WORMS AS WE ARE TO MEDDLE WITH THE DECREES OF HEAVEN
IT IS PLAIN
TO ME THAT HEAVEN IN ITS INSCRUTABLE WISDOM HAS SEEN FIT TO MOVE THIS
DEFENDANT'S RANCH FOR A PURPOSE
WE ARE BUT CREATURES AND WE MUST
SUBMIT
IF HEAVEN HAS CHOSEN TO FAVOR THE DEFENDANT MORGAN IN THIS
MARKED AND WONDERFUL MANNER AND IF HEAVEN DISSATISFIED WITH THE
POSITION OF THE MORGAN RANCH UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE HAS CHOSEN TO REMOVE
IT TO A POSITION MORE ELIGIBLE AND MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR ITS OWNER IT
ILL BECOMES US INSECTS AS WE ARE TO QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF THE ACT OR
INQUIRE INTO THE REASONS THAT PROMPTED IT
NO HEAVEN CREATED THE
RANCHES AND IT IS HEAVEN'S PREROGATIVE TO REARRANGE THEM TO EXPERIMENT
WITH THEM AROUND AT ITS PLEASURE
IT IS FOR US TO SUBMIT WITHOUT
REPINING
I WARN YOU THAT THIS THING WHICH HAS HAPPENED IS A THING WITH WHICH THE
SACRILEGIOUS HANDS AND BRAINS AND TONGUES OF MEN MUST NOT MEDDLE
GENTLEMEN IT IS THE VERDICT OF THIS COURT THAT THE PLAINTIFF RICHARD
HYDE HAS BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS RANCH BY THE VISITATION OF GOD AND FROM
THIS DECISION THERE IS NO APPEAL
BUNCOMBE SEIZED HIS CARGO OF LAW BOOKS AND PLUNGED OUT OF THE COURT ROOM
FRANTIC WITH INDIGNATION
HE PRONOUNCED ROOP TO BE A MIRACULOUS FOOL AN
INSPIRED IDIOT
IN ALL GOOD FAITH HE RETURNED AT NIGHT AND REMONSTRATED
WITH ROOP UPON HIS EXTRAVAGANT DECISION AND IMPLORED HIM TO WALK THE
FLOOR AND THINK FOR HALF AN HOUR AND SEE IF HE COULD NOT FIGURE OUT SOME
SORT OF MODIFICATION OF THE VERDICT
ROOP YIELDED AT LAST AND GOT UP TO
WALK
HE WALKED TWO HOURS AND A HALF AND AT LAST HIS FACE LIT UP
HAPPILY AND HE TOLD BUNCOMBE IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE RANCH
UNDERNEATH THE NEW MORGAN RANCH STILL BELONGED TO HYDE THAT HIS TITLE TO
THE GROUND WAS JUST AS GOOD AS IT HAD EVER BEEN AND THEREFORE HE WAS OF
OPINION THAT HYDE HAD A RIGHT TO DIG IT OUT FROM UNDER THERE AND
THE GENERAL NEVER WAITED TO HEAR THE END OF IT
HE WAS ALWAYS AN
IMPATIENT AND IRASCIBLE MAN THAT WAY
AT THE END OF TWO MONTHS THE FACT
THAT HE HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON WITH A JOKE HAD MANAGED TO BORE ITSELF LIKE
ANOTHER HOOSAC TUNNEL THROUGH THE SOLID ADAMANT OF HIS UNDERSTANDING
CHAPTER XXXV
WHEN WE FINALLY LEFT FOR ESMERALDA HORSEBACK WE HAD AN ADDITION TO THE
COMPANY IN THE PERSON OF CAPT
JOHN NYE THE GOVERNOR'S BROTHER
HE HAD
A GOOD MEMORY AND A TONGUE HUNG IN THE MIDDLE
THIS IS A COMBINATION
WHICH GIVES IMMORTALITY TO CONVERSATION
CAPT
JOHN NEVER SUFFERED THE
TALK TO FLAG OR FALTER ONCE DURING THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES OF THE
JOURNEY
IN ADDITION TO HIS CONVERSATIONAL POWERS HE HAD ONE OR TWO
OTHER ENDOWMENTS OF A MARKED CHARACTER
ONE WAS A SINGULAR HANDINESS
ABOUT DOING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING FROM LAYING OUT A RAILROAD OR
ORGANIZING A POLITICAL PARTY DOWN TO SEWING ON BUTTONS SHOEING A HORSE
OR SETTING A BROKEN LEG OR A HEN
ANOTHER WAS A SPIRIT OF ACCOMMODATION
THAT PROMPTED HIM TO TAKE THE NEEDS DIFFICULTIES AND PERPLEXITIES OF
ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY UPON HIS OWN SHOULDERS AT ANY AND ALL TIMES AND
DISPOSE OF THEM WITH ADMIRABLE FACILITY AND ALACRITY HENCE HE ALWAYS
MANAGED TO FIND VACANT BEDS IN CROWDED INNS AND PLENTY TO EAT IN THE
EMPTIEST LARDERS
AND FINALLY WHEREVER HE MET A MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN
CAMP INN OR DESERT HE EITHER KNEW SUCH PARTIES PERSONALLY OR HAD BEEN
ACQUAINTED WITH A RELATIVE OF THE SAME
SUCH ANOTHER TRAVELING COMRADE
WAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
I CANNOT FORBEAR GIVING A SPECIMEN OF THE WAY IN
WHICH HE OVERCAME DIFFICULTIES
ON THE SECOND DAY OUT WE ARRIVED VERY
TIRED AND HUNGRY AT A POOR LITTLE INN IN THE DESERT AND WERE TOLD THAT
THE HOUSE WAS FULL NO PROVISIONS ON HAND AND NEITHER HAY NOR BARLEY TO
SPARE FOR THE HORSES MUST MOVE ON
THE REST OF US WANTED TO HURRY ON
WHILE IT WAS YET LIGHT BUT CAPT
JOHN INSISTED ON STOPPING AWHILE
WE DISMOUNTED AND ENTERED
THERE WAS NO WELCOME FOR US ON ANY FACE
CAPT
JOHN BEGAN HIS BLANDISHMENTS AND WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES HE HAD
ACCOMPLISHED THE FOLLOWING THINGS VIZ FOUND OLD ACQUAINTANCES IN THREE
TEAMSTERS DISCOVERED THAT HE USED TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH THE LANDLORD'S
MOTHER RECOGNIZED HIS WIFE AS A LADY WHOSE LIFE HE HAD SAVED ONCE IN
CALIFORNIA BY STOPPING HER RUNAWAY HORSE MENDED A CHILD'S BROKEN TOY
AND WON THE FAVOR OF ITS MOTHER A GUEST OF THE INN HELPED THE HOSTLER
BLEED A HORSE AND PRESCRIBED FOR ANOTHER HORSE THAT HAD THE HEAVES
TREATED THE ENTIRE PARTY THREE TIMES AT THE LANDLORD'S BAR PRODUCED A
LATER PAPER THAN ANYBODY HAD SEEN FOR A WEEK AND SAT HIMSELF DOWN TO READ
THE NEWS TO A DEEPLY INTERESTED AUDIENCE
THE RESULT SUMMED UP WAS AS
FOLLOWS THE HOSTLER FOUND PLENTY OF FEED FOR OUR HORSES WE HAD A TROUT
SUPPER AN EXCEEDINGLY SOCIABLE TIME AFTER IT GOOD BEDS TO SLEEP IN AND
A SURPRISING BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING AND WHEN WE LEFT WE LEFT LAMENTED
BY ALL CAPT
JOHN HAD SOME BAD TRAITS BUT HE HAD SOME UNCOMMONLY
VALUABLE ONES TO OFFSET THEM WITH
ESMERALDA WAS IN MANY RESPECTS ANOTHER HUMBOLDT BUT IN A LITTLE MORE
FORWARD STATE
THE CLAIMS WE HAD BEEN PAYING ASSESSMENTS ON WERE
ENTIRELY WORTHLESS AND WE THREW THEM AWAY
THE PRINCIPAL ONE CROPPED
OUT OF THE TOP OF A KNOLL THAT WAS FOURTEEN FEET HIGH AND THE INSPIRED
BOARD OF DIRECTORS WERE RUNNING A TUNNEL UNDER THAT KNOLL TO STRIKE THE
LEDGE
THE TUNNEL WOULD HAVE TO BE SEVENTY FEET LONG AND WOULD THEN
STRIKE THE LEDGE AT THE SAME DEPT THAT A SHAFT TWELVE FEET DEEP WOULD
HAVE REACHED THE BOARD WERE LIVING ON THE ASSESSMENTS N B THIS
HINT COMES TOO LATE FOR THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF NEW YORK SILVER MINERS THEY
HAVE ALREADY LEARNED ALL ABOUT THIS NEAT TRICK BY EXPERIENCE THE BOARD
HAD NO DESIRE TO STRIKE THE LEDGE KNOWING THAT IT WAS AS BARREN OF
SILVER AS A CURBSTONE
THIS REMINISCENCE CALLS TO MIND JIM TOWNSEND'S
TUNNEL
HE HAD PAID ASSESSMENTS ON A MINE CALLED THE DALEY TILL HE WAS
WELL NIGH PENNILESS
FINALLY AN ASSESSMENT WAS LEVIED TO RUN A TUNNEL
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET ON THE DALEY AND TOWNSEND WENT UP ON THE HILL
TO LOOK INTO MATTERS
HE FOUND THE DALEY CROPPING OUT OF THE APEX OF AN EXCEEDINGLY
SHARP POINTED PEAK AND A COUPLE OF MEN UP THERE FACING THE PROPOSED
TUNNEL
TOWNSEND MADE A CALCULATION
THEN HE SAID TO THE MEN
SO YOU HAVE TAKEN A CONTRACT TO RUN A TUNNEL INTO THIS HILL TWO HUNDRED
AND FIFTY FEET TO STRIKE THIS LEDGE
YES SIR
WELL DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE GOT ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND
ARDUOUS UNDERTAKINGS BEFORE YOU THAT WAS EVER CONCEIVED BY MAN
WHY NO HOW IS THAT
BECAUSE THIS HILL IS ONLY TWENTY FIVE FEET THROUGH FROM SIDE TO SIDE
AND SO YOU HAVE GOT TO BUILD TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET OF YOUR
TUNNEL ON TRESTLE WORK
THE WAYS OF SILVER MINING BOARDS ARE EXCEEDINGLY DARK AND SINUOUS
WE TOOK UP VARIOUS CLAIMS AND COMMENCED SHAFTS AND TUNNELS ON THEM BUT
NEVER FINISHED ANY OF THEM
WE HAD TO DO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORK ON
EACH TO HOLD IT ELSE OTHER PARTIES COULD SEIZE OUR PROPERTY AFTER THE
EXPIRATION OF TEN DAYS
WE WERE ALWAYS HUNTING UP NEW CLAIMS AND DOING A
LITTLE WORK ON THEM AND THEN WAITING FOR A BUYER WHO NEVER CAME
WE
NEVER FOUND ANY ORE THAT WOULD YIELD MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS A TON AND
AS THE MILLS CHARGED FIFTY DOLLARS A TON FOR WORKING ORE AND EXTRACTING
THE SILVER OUR POCKET MONEY MELTED STEADILY AWAY AND NONE RETURNED TO
TAKE ITS PLACE
WE LIVED IN A LITTLE CABIN AND COOKED FOR OURSELVES AND
ALTOGETHER IT WAS A HARD LIFE THOUGH A HOPEFUL ONE FOR WE NEVER CEASED
TO EXPECT FORTUNE AND A CUSTOMER TO BURST UPON US SOME DAY
AT LAST WHEN FLOUR REACHED A DOLLAR A POUND AND MONEY COULD NOT BE
BORROWED ON THE BEST SECURITY AT LESS THAN EIGHT PER CENT A MONTH I
BEING WITHOUT THE SECURITY TOO I ABANDONED MINING AND WENT TO MILLING
THAT IS TO SAY I WENT TO WORK AS A COMMON LABORER IN A QUARTZ MILL AT
TEN DOLLARS A WEEK AND BOARD
CHAPTER XXXVI
I HAD ALREADY LEARNED HOW HARD AND LONG AND DISMAL A TASK IT IS TO BURROW
DOWN INTO THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH AND GET OUT THE COVETED ORE AND NOW I
LEARNED THAT THE BURROWING WAS ONLY HALF THE WORK AND THAT TO GET THE
SILVER OUT OF THE ORE WAS THE DREARY AND LABORIOUS OTHER HALF OF IT
WE HAD TO TURN OUT AT SIX IN THE MORNING AND KEEP AT IT TILL DARK
THIS MILL WAS A SIX STAMP AFFAIR DRIVEN BY STEAM
SIX TALL UPRIGHT
RODS OF IRON AS LARGE AS A MAN'S ANKLE AND HEAVILY SHOD WITH A MASS OF
IRON AND STEEL AT THEIR LOWER ENDS WERE FRAMED TOGETHER LIKE A GATE AND
THESE ROSE AND FELL ONE AFTER THE OTHER IN A PONDEROUS DANCE IN AN
IRON BOX CALLED A BATTERY EACH OF THESE RODS OR STAMPS WEIGHED SIX
HUNDRED POUNDS
ONE OF US STOOD BY THE BATTERY ALL DAY LONG BREAKING UP
MASSES OF SILVER BEARING ROCK WITH A SLEDGE AND SHOVELING IT INTO THE
BATTERY
THE CEASELESS DANCE OF THE STAMPS PULVERIZED THE ROCK TO
POWDER AND A STREAM OF WATER THAT TRICKLED INTO THE BATTERY TURNED IT TO
A CREAMY PASTE
THE MINUTEST PARTICLES WERE DRIVEN THROUGH A FINE WIRE
SCREEN WHICH FITTED CLOSE AROUND THE BATTERY AND WERE WASHED INTO GREAT
TUBS WARMED BY SUPER HEATED STEAM AMALGAMATING PANS THEY ARE CALLED
THE MASS OF PULP IN THE PANS WAS KEPT CONSTANTLY STIRRED UP BY REVOLVING
MULLERS A QUANTITY OF QUICKSILVER WAS KEPT ALWAYS IN THE BATTERY AND
THIS SEIZED SOME OF THE LIBERATED GOLD AND SILVER PARTICLES AND HELD ON
TO THEM QUICKSILVER WAS SHAKEN IN A FINE SHOWER INTO THE PANS ALSO
ABOUT EVERY HALF HOUR THROUGH A BUCKSKIN SACK
QUANTITIES OF COARSE
SALT AND SULPHATE OF COPPER WERE ADDED FROM TIME TO TIME TO ASSIST THE
AMALGAMATION BY DESTROYING BASE METALS WHICH COATED THE GOLD AND SILVER
AND WOULD NOT LET IT UNITE WITH THE QUICKSILVER
ALL THESE TIRESOME THINGS WE HAD TO ATTEND TO CONSTANTLY
STREAMS OF
DIRTY WATER FLOWED ALWAYS FROM THE PANS AND WERE CARRIED OFF IN BROAD
WOODEN TROUGHS TO THE RAVINE
ONE WOULD NOT SUPPOSE THAT ATOMS OF GOLD
AND SILVER WOULD FLOAT ON TOP OF SIX INCHES OF WATER BUT THEY DID AND
IN ORDER TO CATCH THEM COARSE BLANKETS WERE LAID IN THE TROUGHS AND
LITTLE OBSTRUCTING RIFFLES CHARGED WITH QUICKSILVER WERE PLACED HERE
AND THERE ACROSS THE TROUGHS ALSO
THESE RIFFLES HAD TO BE CLEANED AND
THE BLANKETS WASHED OUT EVERY EVENING TO GET THEIR PRECIOUS
ACCUMULATIONS AND AFTER ALL THIS ETERNITY OF TROUBLE ONE THIRD OF THE
SILVER AND GOLD IN A TON OF ROCK WOULD FIND ITS WAY TO THE END OF THE
TROUGHS IN THE RAVINE AT LAST AND HAVE TO BE WORKED OVER AGAIN SOME DAY
THERE IS NOTHING SO AGGRAVATING AS SILVER MILLING
THERE NEVER WAS ANY
IDLE TIME IN THAT MILL
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO DO
IT IS A PITY
THAT ADAM COULD NOT HAVE GONE STRAIGHT OUT OF EDEN INTO A QUARTZ MILL IN
ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE FULL FORCE OF HIS DOOM TO EARN HIS BREAD BY THE
SWEAT OF HIS BROW EVERY NOW AND THEN DURING THE DAY WE HAD TO SCOOP
SOME PULP OUT OF THE PANS AND TEDIOUSLY WASH IT IN A HORN SPOON WASH
IT LITTLE BY LITTLE OVER THE EDGE TILL AT LAST NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT SOME
LITTLE DULL GLOBULES OF QUICKSILVER IN THE BOTTOM
IF THEY WERE SOFT AND
YIELDING THE PAN NEEDED SOME SALT OR SOME SULPHATE OF COPPER OR SOME
OTHER CHEMICAL RUBBISH TO ASSIST DIGESTION IF THEY WERE CRISP TO THE
TOUCH AND WOULD RETAIN A DINT THEY WERE FREIGHTED WITH ALL THE SILVER
AND GOLD THEY COULD SEIZE AND HOLD AND CONSEQUENTLY THE PAN NEEDED A
FRESH CHARGE OF QUICKSILVER
WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO ONE
COULD ALWAYS SCREEN TAILINGS THAT IS TO SAY HE COULD SHOVEL UP THE
DRIED SAND THAT HAD WASHED DOWN TO THE RAVINE THROUGH THE TROUGHS AND
DASH IT AGAINST AN UPRIGHT WIRE SCREEN TO FREE IT FROM PEBBLES AND
PREPARE IT FOR WORKING OVER
THE PROCESS OF AMALGAMATION DIFFERED IN THE VARIOUS MILLS AND THIS
INCLUDED CHANGES IN STYLE OF PANS AND OTHER MACHINERY AND A GREAT
DIVERSITY OF OPINION EXISTED AS TO THE BEST IN USE BUT NONE OF THE
METHODS EMPLOYED INVOLVED THE PRINCIPLE OF MILLING ORE WITHOUT
SCREENING THE TAILINGS OF ALL RECREATIONS IN THE WORLD SCREENING
TAILINGS ON A HOT DAY WITH A LONG HANDLED SHOVEL IS THE MOST
UNDESIRABLE
AT THE END OF THE WEEK THE MACHINERY WAS STOPPED AND WE CLEANED UP
THAT IS TO SAY WE GOT THE PULP OUT OF THE PANS AND BATTERIES AND WASHED
THE MUD PATIENTLY AWAY TILL NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT THE LONG ACCUMULATING
MASS OF QUICKSILVER WITH ITS IMPRISONED TREASURES
THIS WE MADE INTO
HEAVY COMPACT SNOW BALLS AND PILED THEM UP IN A BRIGHT LUXURIOUS HEAP
FOR INSPECTION
MAKING THESE SNOW BALLS COST ME A FINE GOLD RING THAT
AND IGNORANCE TOGETHER FOR THE QUICKSILVER INVADED THE RING WITH THE
SAME FACILITY WITH WHICH WATER SATURATES A SPONGE SEPARATED ITS
PARTICLES AND THE RING CRUMBLED TO PIECES
WE PUT OUR PILE OF QUICKSILVER BALLS INTO AN IRON RETORT THAT HAD A PIPE
LEADING FROM IT TO A PAIL OF WATER AND THEN APPLIED A ROASTING HEAT
THE QUICKSILVER TURNED TO VAPOR ESCAPED THROUGH THE PIPE INTO THE PAIL
AND THE WATER TURNED IT INTO GOOD WHOLESOME QUICKSILVER AGAIN
QUICKSILVER IS VERY COSTLY AND THEY NEVER WASTE IT
ON OPENING THE
RETORT THERE WAS OUR WEEK'S WORK A LUMP OF PURE WHITE FROSTY LOOKING
SILVER TWICE AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD
PERHAPS A FIFTH OF THE MASS WAS
GOLD BUT THE COLOR OF IT DID NOT SHOW WOULD NOT HAVE SHOWN IF TWO
THIRDS OF IT HAD BEEN GOLD
WE MELTED IT UP AND MADE A SOLID BRICK OF IT
BY POURING IT INTO AN IRON BRICK MOULD
BY SUCH A TEDIOUS AND LABORIOUS PROCESS WERE SILVER BRICKS OBTAINED
THIS MILL WAS BUT ONE OF MANY OTHERS IN OPERATION AT THE TIME
THE FIRST
ONE IN NEVADA WAS BUILT AT EGAN CANYON AND WAS A SMALL INSIGNIFICANT
AFFAIR AND COMPARED MOST UNFAVORABLY WITH SOME OF THE IMMENSE
ESTABLISHMENTS AFTERWARDS LOCATED AT VIRGINIA CITY AND ELSEWHERE
FROM OUR BRICKS A LITTLE CORNER WAS CHIPPED OFF FOR THE FIRE ASSAY A
METHOD USED TO DETERMINE THE PROPORTIONS OF GOLD SILVER AND BASE METALS
IN THE MASS
THIS IS AN INTERESTING PROCESS
THE CHIP IS HAMMERED OUT
AS THIN AS PAPER AND WEIGHED ON SCALES SO FINE AND SENSITIVE THAT IF YOU
WEIGH A TWO INCH SCRAP OF PAPER ON THEM AND THEN WRITE YOUR NAME ON THE
PAPER WITH A COURSE SOFT PENCIL AND WEIGH IT AGAIN THE SCALES WILL TAKE
MARKED NOTICE OF THE ADDITION
THEN A LITTLE LEAD ALSO WEIGHED IS ROLLED UP WITH THE FLAKE OF SILVER
AND THE TWO ARE MELTED AT A GREAT HEAT IN A SMALL VESSEL CALLED A CUPEL
MADE BY COMPRESSING BONE ASHES INTO A CUP SHAPE IN A STEEL MOLD
THE
BASE METALS OXYDIZE AND ARE ABSORBED WITH THE LEAD INTO THE PORES OF THE
CUPEL
A BUTTON OR GLOBULE OF PERFECTLY PURE GOLD AND SILVER IS LEFT
BEHIND AND BY WEIGHING IT AND NOTING THE LOSS THE ASSAYER KNOWS THE
PROPORTION OF BASE METAL THE BRICK CONTAINS
HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE GOLD
FROM THE SILVER NOW
THE BUTTON IS HAMMERED OUT FLAT AND THIN PUT IN
THE FURNACE AND KEPT SOME TIME AT A RED HEAT AFTER COOLING IT OFF IT IS
ROLLED UP LIKE A QUILL AND HEATED IN A GLASS VESSEL CONTAINING NITRIC
ACID THE ACID DISSOLVES THE SILVER AND LEAVES THE GOLD PURE AND READY TO
BE WEIGHED ON ITS OWN MERITS
THEN SALT WATER IS POURED INTO THE VESSEL
CONTAINING THE DISSOLVED SILVER AND THE SILVER RETURNS TO PALPABLE FORM
AGAIN AND SINKS TO THE BOTTOM
NOTHING NOW REMAINS BUT TO WEIGH IT THEN
THE PROPORTIONS OF THE SEVERAL METALS CONTAINED IN THE BRICK ARE KNOWN
AND THE ASSAYER STAMPS THE VALUE OF THE BRICK UPON ITS SURFACE
THE SAGACIOUS READER WILL KNOW NOW WITHOUT BEING TOLD THAT THE
SPECULATIVE MINER IN GETTING A FIRE ASSAY MADE OF A PIECE OF ROCK FROM
HIS MINE TO HELP HIM SELL THE SAME WAS NOT IN THE HABIT OF PICKING OUT
THE LEAST VALUABLE FRAGMENT OF ROCK ON HIS DUMP PILE BUT QUITE THE
CONTRARY
I HAVE SEEN MEN HUNT OVER A PILE OF NEARLY WORTHLESS QUARTZ
FOR AN HOUR AND AT LAST FIND A LITTLE PIECE AS LARGE AS A FILBERT WHICH
WAS RICH IN GOLD AND SILVER AND THIS WAS RESERVED FOR A FIRE ASSAY OF
COURSE THE FIRE ASSAY WOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT A TON OF SUCH ROCK WOULD
YIELD HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND ON SUCH ASSAYS MANY AN UTTERLY WORTHLESS
MINE WAS SOLD
ASSAYING WAS A GOOD BUSINESS AND SO SOME MEN ENGAGED IN IT
OCCASIONALLY WHO WERE NOT STRICTLY SCIENTIFIC AND CAPABLE
ONE ASSAYER
GOT SUCH RICH RESULTS OUT OF ALL SPECIMENS BROUGHT TO HIM THAT IN TIME HE
ACQUIRED ALMOST A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS
BUT LIKE ALL MEN WHO ACHIEVE
SUCCESS HE BECAME AN OBJECT OF ENVY AND SUSPICION
THE OTHER ASSAYERS
ENTERED INTO A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM AND LET SOME PROMINENT CITIZENS
INTO THE SECRET IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT THEY MEANT FAIRLY
THEN THEY BROKE
A LITTLE FRAGMENT OFF A CARPENTER'S GRINDSTONE AND GOT A STRANGER TO TAKE
IT TO THE POPULAR SCIENTIST AND GET IT ASSAYED
IN THE COURSE OF AN HOUR
THE RESULT CAME WHEREBY IT APPEARED THAT A TON OF THAT ROCK WOULD YIELD
1 184 40 IN SILVER AND 366 36 IN GOLD
DUE PUBLICATION OF THE WHOLE MATTER WAS MADE IN THE PAPER AND THE
POPULAR ASSAYER LEFT TOWN BETWEEN TWO DAYS
I WILL REMARK IN PASSING THAT I ONLY REMAINED IN THE MILLING BUSINESS
ONE WEEK
I TOLD MY EMPLOYER I COULD NOT STAY LONGER WITHOUT AN ADVANCE
IN MY WAGES THAT I LIKED QUARTZ MILLING INDEED WAS INFATUATED WITH IT
THAT I HAD NEVER BEFORE GROWN SO TENDERLY ATTACHED TO AN OCCUPATION IN SO
SHORT A TIME THAT NOTHING IT SEEMED TO ME GAVE SUCH SCOPE TO
INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AS FEEDING A BATTERY AND SCREENING TAILINGS AND
NOTHING SO STIMULATED THE MORAL ATTRIBUTES AS RETORTING BULLION AND
WASHING BLANKETS STILL I FELT CONSTRAINED TO ASK AN INCREASE OF SALARY
HE SAID HE WAS PAYING ME TEN DOLLARS A WEEK AND THOUGHT IT A GOOD ROUND
SUM
HOW MUCH DID I WANT
I SAID ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND BOARD WAS ABOUT
ALL I COULD REASONABLY ASK CONSIDERING THE HARD TIMES
I WAS ORDERED OFF THE PREMISES AND YET WHEN I LOOK BACK TO THOSE DAYS
AND CALL TO MIND THE EXCEEDING HARDNESS OF THE LABOR I PERFORMED IN THAT
MILL I ONLY REGRET THAT I DID NOT ASK HIM SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND
SHORTLY AFTER THIS I BEGAN TO GROW CRAZY ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE
POPULATION ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS AND WONDERFUL CEMENT MINE AND TO MAKE
PREPARATIONS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY OPPORTUNITY THAT MIGHT OFFER TO GO
AND HELP HUNT FOR IT
CHAPTER XXXVII
IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MONO LAKE THAT THE MARVELLOUS
WHITEMAN CEMENT MINE WAS SUPPOSED TO LIE
EVERY NOW AND THEN IT WOULD BE
REPORTED THAT MR
W
HAD PASSED STEALTHILY THROUGH ESMERALDA AT DEAD OF
NIGHT IN DISGUISE AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE A WILD EXCITEMENT BECAUSE HE
MUST BE STEERING FOR HIS SECRET MINE AND NOW WAS THE TIME TO FOLLOW HIM
IN LESS THAN THREE HOURS AFTER DAYLIGHT ALL THE HORSES AND MULES AND
DONKEYS IN THE VICINITY WOULD BE BOUGHT HIRED OR STOLEN AND HALF THE
COMMUNITY WOULD BE OFF FOR THE MOUNTAINS FOLLOWING IN THE WAKE OF
WHITEMAN
BUT W
WOULD DRIFT ABOUT THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN GORGES FOR DAYS
TOGETHER IN A PURPOSELESS SORT OF WAY UNTIL THE PROVISIONS OF THE
MINERS RAN OUT AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK HOME
I HAVE KNOWN IT
REPORTED AT ELEVEN AT NIGHT IN A LARGE MINING CAMP THAT WHITEMAN HAD
JUST PASSED THROUGH AND IN TWO HOURS THE STREETS SO QUIET BEFORE WOULD
BE SWARMING WITH MEN AND ANIMALS
EVERY INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE TRYING TO BE
VERY SECRET BUT YET VENTURING TO WHISPER TO JUST ONE NEIGHBOR THAT W
HAD PASSED THROUGH
AND LONG BEFORE DAYLIGHT THIS IN THE DEAD OF
WINTER THE STAMPEDE WOULD BE COMPLETE THE CAMP DESERTED AND THE WHOLE
POPULATION GONE CHASING AFTER W
THE TRADITION WAS THAT IN THE EARLY IMMIGRATION MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
AGO THREE YOUNG GERMANS BROTHERS WHO HAD SURVIVED AN INDIAN MASSACRE
ON THE PLAINS WANDERED ON FOOT THROUGH THE DESERTS AVOIDING ALL TRAILS
AND ROADS AND SIMPLY HOLDING A WESTERLY DIRECTION AND HOPING TO FIND
CALIFORNIA BEFORE THEY STARVED OR DIED OF FATIGUE
AND IN A GORGE IN
THE MOUNTAINS THEY SAT DOWN TO REST ONE DAY WHEN ONE OF THEM NOTICED A
CURIOUS VEIN OF CEMENT RUNNING ALONG THE GROUND SHOT FULL OF LUMPS OF
DULL YELLOW METAL
THEY SAW THAT IT WAS GOLD AND THAT HERE WAS A
FORTUNE TO BE ACQUIRED IN A SINGLE DAY
THE VEIN WAS ABOUT AS WIDE AS A
CURBSTONE AND FULLY TWO THIRDS OF IT WAS PURE GOLD
EVERY POUND OF THE
WONDERFUL CEMENT WAS WORTH WELL NIGH 200
EACH OF THE BROTHERS LOADED HIMSELF WITH ABOUT TWENTY FIVE POUNDS OF IT
AND THEN THEY COVERED UP ALL TRACES OF THE VEIN MADE A RUDE DRAWING OF
THE LOCALITY AND THE PRINCIPAL LANDMARKS IN THE VICINITY AND STARTED
WESTWARD AGAIN
BUT TROUBLES THICKENED ABOUT THEM
IN THEIR WANDERINGS
ONE BROTHER FELL AND BROKE HIS LEG AND THE OTHERS WERE OBLIGED TO GO ON
AND LEAVE HIM TO DIE IN THE WILDERNESS
ANOTHER WORN OUT AND STARVING
GAVE UP BY AND BY AND LAID DOWN TO DIE BUT AFTER TWO OR THREE WEEKS OF
INCREDIBLE HARDSHIPS THE THIRD REACHED THE SETTLEMENTS OF CALIFORNIA
EXHAUSTED SICK AND HIS MIND DERANGED BY HIS SUFFERINGS
HE HAD THROWN
AWAY ALL HIS CEMENT BUT A FEW FRAGMENTS BUT THESE WERE SUFFICIENT TO SET
EVERYBODY WILD WITH EXCITEMENT
HOWEVER HE HAD HAD ENOUGH OF THE CEMENT
COUNTRY AND NOTHING COULD INDUCE HIM TO LEAD A PARTY THITHER
HE WAS
ENTIRELY CONTENT TO WORK ON A FARM FOR WAGES
BUT HE GAVE WHITEMAN HIS
MAP AND DESCRIBED THE CEMENT REGION AS WELL AS HE COULD AND THUS
TRANSFERRED THE CURSE TO THAT GENTLEMAN FOR WHEN I HAD MY ONE ACCIDENTAL
GLIMPSE OF MR
W
IN ESMERALDA HE HAD BEEN HUNTING FOR THE LOST MINE IN
HUNGER AND THIRST POVERTY AND SICKNESS FOR TWELVE OR THIRTEEN YEARS
SOME PEOPLE BELIEVED HE HAD FOUND IT BUT MOST PEOPLE BELIEVED HE HAD
NOT
I SAW A PIECE OF CEMENT AS LARGE AS MY FIST WHICH WAS SAID TO HAVE
BEEN GIVEN TO WHITEMAN BY THE YOUNG GERMAN AND IT WAS OF A SEDUCTIVE
NATURE
LUMPS OF VIRGIN GOLD WERE AS THICK IN IT AS RAISINS IN A SLICE
OF FRUIT CAKE
THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING SUCH A MINE ONE WEEK WOULD BE
SUFFICIENT FOR A MAN OF REASONABLE DESIRES
A NEW PARTNER OF OURS A MR
HIGBIE KNEW WHITEMAN WELL BY SIGHT AND A
FRIEND OF OURS A MR
VAN DORN WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND NOT
ONLY THAT BUT HAD WHITEMAN'S PROMISE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A PRIVATE HINT
IN TIME TO ENABLE HIM TO JOIN THE NEXT CEMENT EXPEDITION
VAN DORN HAD
PROMISED TO EXTEND THE HINT TO US
ONE EVENING HIGBIE CAME IN GREATLY
EXCITED AND SAID HE FELT CERTAIN HE HAD RECOGNIZED WHITEMAN UP TOWN
DISGUISED AND IN A PRETENDED STATE OF INTOXICATION
IN A LITTLE WHILE
VAN DORN ARRIVED AND CONFIRMED THE NEWS AND SO WE GATHERED IN OUR CABIN
AND WITH HEADS CLOSE TOGETHER ARRANGED OUR PLANS IN IMPRESSIVE WHISPERS
WE WERE TO LEAVE TOWN QUIETLY AFTER MIDNIGHT IN TWO OR THREE SMALL
PARTIES SO AS NOT TO ATTRACT ATTENTION AND MEET AT DAWN ON THE DIVIDE
OVERLOOKING MONO LAKE EIGHT OR NINE MILES DISTANT
WE WERE TO MAKE NO
NOISE AFTER STARTING AND NOT SPEAK ABOVE A WHISPER UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT FOR ONCE WHITEMAN'S PRESENCE WAS
UNKNOWN IN THE TOWN AND HIS EXPEDITION UNSUSPECTED
OUR CONCLAVE BROKE
UP AT NINE O'CLOCK AND WE SET ABOUT OUR PREPARATION DILIGENTLY AND WITH
PROFOUND SECRECY
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK WE SADDLED OUR HORSES HITCHED THEM
WITH THEIR LONG RIATAS OR LASSOS AND THEN BROUGHT OUT A SIDE OF BACON
A SACK OF BEANS A SMALL SACK OF COFFEE SOME SUGAR A HUNDRED POUNDS OF
FLOUR IN SACKS SOME TIN CUPS AND A COFFEE POT FRYING PAN AND SOME FEW
OTHER NECESSARY ARTICLES
ALL THESE THINGS WERE PACKED ON THE BACK OF
A LED HORSE AND WHOEVER HAS NOT BEEN TAUGHT BY A SPANISH ADEPT TO PACK
AN ANIMAL LET HIM NEVER HOPE TO DO THE THING BY NATURAL SMARTNESS
THAT
IS IMPOSSIBLE
HIGBIE HAD HAD SOME EXPERIENCE BUT WAS NOT PERFECT
HE
PUT ON THE PACK SADDLE A THING LIKE A SAW BUCK PILED THE PROPERTY ON
IT AND THEN WOUND A ROPE ALL OVER AND ABOUT IT AND UNDER IT EVERY WHICH
WAY TAKING A HITCH IN IT EVERY NOW AND THEN AND OCCASIONALLY SURGING
BACK ON IT TILL THE HORSE'S SIDES SUNK IN AND HE GASPED FOR BREATH BUT
EVERY TIME THE LASHINGS GREW TIGHT IN ONE PLACE THEY LOOSENED IN ANOTHER
WE NEVER DID GET THE LOAD TIGHT ALL OVER BUT WE GOT IT SO THAT IT WOULD
DO AFTER A FASHION AND THEN WE STARTED IN SINGLE FILE CLOSE ORDER
AND WITHOUT A WORD
IT WAS A DARK NIGHT
WE KEPT THE MIDDLE OF THE
ROAD AND PROCEEDED IN A SLOW WALK PAST THE ROWS OF CABINS AND WHENEVER
A MINER CAME TO HIS DOOR I TREMBLED FOR FEAR THE LIGHT WOULD SHINE ON US
AN EXCITE CURIOSITY
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
WE BEGAN THE LONG WINDING
ASCENT OF THE CANYON TOWARD THE DIVIDE AND PRESENTLY THE CABINS BEGAN
TO GROW INFREQUENT AND THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THEM WIDER AND WIDER AND
THEN I BEGAN TO BREATHE TOLERABLY FREELY AND FEEL LESS LIKE A THIEF AND A
MURDERER
I WAS IN THE REAR LEADING THE PACK HORSE
AS THE ASCENT GREW
STEEPER HE GREW PROPORTIONATELY LESS SATISFIED WITH HIS CARGO AND BEGAN
TO PULL BACK ON HIS RIATA OCCASIONALLY AND DELAY PROGRESS
MY COMRADES
WERE PASSING OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GLOOM
I WAS GETTING ANXIOUS
I COAXED
AND BULLIED THE PACK HORSE TILL I PRESENTLY GOT HIM INTO A TROT AND THEN
THE TIN CUPS AND PANS STRUNG ABOUT HIS PERSON FRIGHTENED HIM AND HE RAN
HIS RIATA WAS WOUND AROUND THE PUMMEL OF MY SADDLE AND SO AS HE WENT BY
HE DRAGGED ME FROM MY HORSE AND THE TWO ANIMALS TRAVELED BRISKLY ON
WITHOUT ME
BUT I WAS NOT ALONE THE LOOSENED CARGO TUMBLED OVERBOARD
FROM THE PACK HORSE AND FELL CLOSE TO ME
IT WAS ABREAST OF ALMOST THE
LAST CABIN
A MINER CAME OUT AND SAID
HELLO
I WAS THIRTY STEPS FROM HIM AND KNEW HE COULD NOT SEE ME IT WAS SO VERY
DARK IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAIN
SO I LAY STILL
ANOTHER HEAD
APPEARED IN THE LIGHT OF THE CABIN DOOR AND PRESENTLY THE TWO MEN WALKED
TOWARD ME
THEY STOPPED WITHIN TEN STEPS OF ME AND ONE SAID
SH LISTEN
I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN A MORE DISTRESSED STATE IF I HAD BEEN ESCAPING
JUSTICE WITH A PRICE ON MY HEAD
THEN THE MINERS APPEARED TO SIT DOWN ON
A BOULDER THOUGH I COULD NOT SEE THEM DISTINCTLY ENOUGH TO BE VERY SURE
WHAT THEY DID
ONE SAID
I HEARD A NOISE AS PLAIN AS I EVER HEARD ANYTHING
IT SEEMED TO BE
ABOUT THERE
A STONE WHIZZED BY MY HEAD
I FLATTENED MYSELF OUT IN THE DUST LIKE A
POSTAGE STAMP AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF HE MENDED HIS AIM EVER SO LITTLE
HE WOULD PROBABLY HEAR ANOTHER NOISE
IN MY HEART NOW I EXECRATED
SECRET EXPEDITIONS
I PROMISED MYSELF THAT THIS SHOULD BE MY LAST
THOUGH THE SIERRAS WERE RIBBED WITH CEMENT VEINS
THEN ONE OF THE MEN
SAID
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WELCH KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN HE SAID
HE SAW WHITEMAN TO DAY
I HEARD HORSES THAT WAS THE NOISE
I AM GOING
DOWN TO WELCH'S RIGHT AWAY
THEY LEFT AND I WAS GLAD
I DID NOT CARE WHITHER THEY WENT SO THEY
WENT
I WAS WILLING THEY SHOULD VISIT WELCH AND THE SOONER THE BETTER
AS SOON AS THEY CLOSED THEIR CABIN DOOR MY COMRADES EMERGED FROM THE
GLOOM THEY HAD CAUGHT THE HORSES AND WERE WAITING FOR A CLEAR COAST
AGAIN
WE REMOUNTED THE CARGO ON THE PACK HORSE AND GOT UNDER WAY AND
AS DAY BROKE WE REACHED THE DIVIDE AND JOINED VAN DORN
THEN WE
JOURNEYED DOWN INTO THE VALLEY OF THE LAKE AND FEELING SECURE WE HALTED
TO COOK BREAKFAST FOR WE WERE TIRED AND SLEEPY AND HUNGRY
THREE HOURS
LATER THE REST OF THE POPULATION FILED OVER THE DIVIDE IN A LONG
PROCESSION AND DRIFTED OFF OUT OF SIGHT AROUND THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE
WHETHER OR NOT MY ACCIDENT HAD PRODUCED THIS RESULT WE NEVER KNEW BUT AT
LEAST ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THE SECRET WAS OUT AND WHITEMAN WOULD NOT
ENTER UPON A SEARCH FOR THE CEMENT MINE THIS TIME
WE WERE FILLED WITH
CHAGRIN
WE HELD A COUNCIL AND DECIDED TO MAKE THE BEST OF OUR MISFORTUNE AND
ENJOY A WEEK'S HOLIDAY ON THE BORDERS OF THE CURIOUS LAKE
MONO IT IS
SOMETIMES CALLED AND SOMETIMES THE DEAD SEA OF CALIFORNIA IT IS ONE
OF THE STRANGEST FREAKS OF NATURE TO BE FOUND IN ANY LAND BUT IT IS
HARDLY EVER MENTIONED IN PRINT AND VERY SELDOM VISITED BECAUSE IT LIES
AWAY OFF THE USUAL ROUTES OF TRAVEL AND BESIDES IS SO DIFFICULT TO GET AT
THAT ONLY MEN CONTENT TO ENDURE THE ROUGHEST LIFE WILL CONSENT TO TAKE
UPON THEMSELVES THE DISCOMFORTS OF SUCH A TRIP
ON THE MORNING OF OUR
SECOND DAY WE TRAVELED AROUND TO A REMOTE AND PARTICULARLY WILD SPOT ON
THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE WHERE A STREAM OF FRESH ICE COLD WATER ENTERED
IT FROM THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AND THEN WE WENT REGULARLY INTO CAMP
WE
HIRED A LARGE BOAT AND TWO SHOT GUNS FROM A LONELY RANCHMAN WHO LIVED
SOME TEN MILES FURTHER ON AND MADE READY FOR COMFORT AND RECREATION
WE SOON GOT THOROUGHLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE LAKE AND ALL ITS
PECULIARITIES
CHAPTER XXXVIII
MONO LAKE LIES IN A LIFELESS TREELESS HIDEOUS DESERT EIGHT THOUSAND
FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND IS GUARDED BY MOUNTAINS TWO THOUSAND
FEET HIGHER WHOSE SUMMITS ARE ALWAYS CLOTHED IN CLOUDS
THIS SOLEMN
SILENT SAIL LESS SEA THIS LONELY TENANT OF THE LONELIEST SPOT ON EARTH
IS LITTLE GRACED WITH THE PICTURESQUE
IT IS AN UNPRETENDING EXPANSE
OF GRAYISH WATER ABOUT A HUNDRED MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE WITH TWO
ISLANDS IN ITS CENTRE MERE UPHEAVALS OF RENT AND SCORCHED AND BLISTERED
LAVA SNOWED OVER WITH GRAY BANKS AND DRIFTS OF PUMICE STONE AND ASHES
THE WINDING SHEET OF THE DEAD VOLCANO WHOSE VAST CRATER THE LAKE HAS
SEIZED UPON AND OCCUPIED
THE LAKE IS TWO HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND ITS SLUGGISH WATERS ARE SO STRONG
WITH ALKALI THAT IF YOU ONLY DIP THE MOST HOPELESSLY SOILED GARMENT INTO
THEM ONCE OR TWICE AND WRING IT OUT IT WILL BE FOUND AS CLEAN AS IF IT
HAD BEEN THROUGH THE ABLEST OF WASHERWOMEN'S HANDS
WHILE WE CAMPED
THERE OUR LAUNDRY WORK WAS EASY
WE TIED THE WEEK'S WASHING ASTERN OF
OUR BOAT AND SAILED A QUARTER OF A MILE AND THE JOB WAS COMPLETE ALL
TO THE WRINGING OUT
IF WE THREW THE WATER ON OUR HEADS AND GAVE THEM A
RUB OR SO THE WHITE LATHER WOULD PILE UP THREE INCHES HIGH
THIS WATER
IS NOT GOOD FOR BRUISED PLACES AND ABRASIONS OF THE SKIN
WE HAD A
VALUABLE DOG
HE HAD RAW PLACES ON HIM
HE HAD MORE RAW PLACES ON HIM
THAN SOUND ONES
HE WAS THE RAWEST DOG I ALMOST EVER SAW
HE JUMPED
OVERBOARD ONE DAY TO GET AWAY FROM THE FLIES
BUT IT WAS BAD JUDGMENT
IN HIS CONDITION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS COMFORTABLE TO JUMP INTO THE
FIRE
THE ALKALI WATER NIPPED HIM IN ALL THE RAW PLACES SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HE
STRUCK OUT FOR THE SHORE WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
HE YELPED AND
BARKED AND HOWLED AS HE WENT AND BY THE TIME HE GOT TO THE SHORE THERE
WAS NO BARK TO HIM FOR HE HAD BARKED THE BARK ALL OUT OF HIS INSIDE AND
THE ALKALI WATER HAD CLEANED THE BARK ALL OFF HIS OUTSIDE AND HE
PROBABLY WISHED HE HAD NEVER EMBARKED IN ANY SUCH ENTERPRISE
HE RAN
ROUND AND ROUND IN A CIRCLE AND PAWED THE EARTH AND CLAWED THE AIR AND
THREW DOUBLE SOMERSAULTS SOMETIMES BACKWARD AND SOMETIMES FORWARD IN
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MANNER
HE WAS NOT A DEMONSTRATIVE DOG AS A
GENERAL THING BUT RATHER OF A GRAVE AND SERIOUS TURN OF MIND AND I
NEVER SAW HIM TAKE SO MUCH INTEREST IN ANYTHING BEFORE
HE FINALLY
STRUCK OUT OVER THE MOUNTAINS AT A GAIT WHICH WE ESTIMATED AT ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES AN HOUR AND HE IS GOING YET
THIS WAS ABOUT
NINE YEARS AGO
WE LOOK FOR WHAT IS LEFT OF HIM ALONG HERE EVERY DAY
A WHITE MAN CANNOT DRINK THE WATER OF MONO LAKE FOR IT IS NEARLY PURE
LYE
IT IS SAID THAT THE INDIANS IN THE VICINITY DRINK IT SOMETIMES
THOUGH
IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE FOR THEY ARE AMONG THE PUREST LIARS I EVER
SAW
THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR THIS JOKE EXCEPT TO
PARTIES REQUIRING AN EXPLANATION OF IT
THIS JOKE HAS RECEIVED HIGH
COMMENDATION FROM SOME OF THE ABLEST MINDS OF THE AGE
THERE ARE NO FISH IN MONO LAKE NO FROGS NO SNAKES NO POLLIWIGS
NOTHING IN FACT THAT GOES TO MAKE LIFE DESIRABLE
MILLIONS OF WILD
DUCKS AND SEA GULLS SWIM ABOUT THE SURFACE BUT NO LIVING THING EXISTS
UNDER THE SURFACE EXCEPT A WHITE FEATHERY SORT OF WORM ONE HALF AN INCH
LONG WHICH LOOKS LIKE A BIT OF WHITE THREAD FRAYED OUT AT THE SIDES
IF
YOU DIP UP A GALLON OF WATER YOU WILL GET ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF
THESE
THEY GIVE TO THE WATER A SORT OF GRAYISH WHITE APPEARANCE
THEN
THERE IS A FLY WHICH LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE OUR HOUSE FLY
THESE SETTLE
ON THE BEACH TO EAT THE WORMS THAT WASH ASHORE AND ANY TIME YOU CAN SEE
THERE A BELT OF FLIES AN INCH DEEP AND SIX FEET WIDE AND THIS BELT
EXTENDS CLEAR AROUND THE LAKE A BELT OF FLIES ONE HUNDRED MILES LONG
IF YOU THROW A STONE AMONG THEM THEY SWARM UP SO THICK THAT THEY LOOK
DENSE LIKE A CLOUD
YOU CAN HOLD THEM UNDER WATER AS LONG AS YOU
PLEASE THEY DO NOT MIND IT THEY ARE ONLY PROUD OF IT
WHEN YOU LET
THEM GO THEY POP UP TO THE SURFACE AS DRY AS A PATENT OFFICE REPORT AND
WALK OFF AS UNCONCERNEDLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN EDUCATED ESPECIALLY WITH A
VIEW TO AFFORDING INSTRUCTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TO MAN IN THAT PARTICULAR
WAY
PROVIDENCE LEAVES NOTHING TO GO BY CHANCE
ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR
USES AND THEIR PART AND PROPER PLACE IN NATURE'S ECONOMY THE DUCKS EAT
THE FLIES THE FLIES EAT THE WORMS THE INDIANS EAT ALL THREE THE WILD
CATS EAT THE INDIANS THE WHITE FOLKS EAT THE WILD CATS AND THUS ALL
THINGS ARE LOVELY
MONO LAKE IS A HUNDRED MILES IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE OCEAN AND
BETWEEN IT AND THE OCEAN ARE ONE OR TWO RANGES OF MOUNTAINS YET
THOUSANDS OF SEA GULLS GO THERE EVERY SEASON TO LAY THEIR EGGS AND REAR
THEIR YOUNG
ONE WOULD AS SOON EXPECT TO FIND SEA GULLS IN KANSAS
AND IN THIS CONNECTION LET US OBSERVE ANOTHER INSTANCE OF NATURE'S
WISDOM
THE ISLANDS IN THE LAKE BEING MERELY HUGE MASSES OF LAVA COATED
OVER WITH ASHES AND PUMICE STONE AND UTTERLY INNOCENT OF VEGETATION OR
ANYTHING THAT WOULD BURN AND SEA GULL'S EGGS BEING ENTIRELY USELESS TO
ANYBODY UNLESS THEY BE COOKED NATURE HAS PROVIDED AN UNFAILING SPRING OF
BOILING WATER ON THE LARGEST ISLAND AND YOU CAN PUT YOUR EGGS IN THERE
AND IN FOUR MINUTES YOU CAN BOIL THEM AS HARD AS ANY STATEMENT I HAVE
MADE DURING THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS
WITHIN TEN FEET OF THE BOILING
SPRING IS A SPRING OF PURE COLD WATER SWEET AND WHOLESOME
SO IN THAT ISLAND YOU GET YOUR BOARD AND WASHING FREE OF CHARGE AND IF
NATURE HAD GONE FURTHER AND FURNISHED A NICE AMERICAN HOTEL CLERK WHO WAS
CRUSTY AND DISOBLIGING AND DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE TIME TABLES
OR THE RAILROAD ROUTES OR ANYTHING AND WAS PROUD OF IT I WOULD NOT
WISH FOR A MORE DESIRABLE BOARDING HOUSE
HALF A DOZEN LITTLE MOUNTAIN BROOKS FLOW INTO MONO LAKE BUT NOT A STREAM
OF ANY KIND FLOWS OUT OF IT
IT NEITHER RISES NOR FALLS APPARENTLY AND
WHAT IT DOES WITH ITS SURPLUS WATER IS A DARK AND BLOODY MYSTERY
THERE ARE ONLY TWO SEASONS IN THE REGION ROUND ABOUT MONO LAKE AND THESE
ARE THE BREAKING UP OF ONE WINTER AND THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT
MORE
THAN ONCE IN ESMERALDA I HAVE SEEN A PERFECTLY BLISTERING MORNING OPEN
UP WITH THE THERMOMETER AT NINETY DEGREES AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND SEEN THE
SNOW FALL FOURTEEN INCHES DEEP AND THAT SAME IDENTICAL THERMOMETER GO
DOWN TO FORTY FOUR DEGREES UNDER SHELTER BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
UNDER FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES IT SNOWS AT LEAST ONCE IN EVERY SINGLE
MONTH IN THE YEAR IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF MONO
SO UNCERTAIN IS THE
CLIMATE IN SUMMER THAT A LADY WHO GOES OUT VISITING CANNOT HOPE TO BE
PREPARED FOR ALL EMERGENCIES UNLESS SHE TAKES HER FAN UNDER ONE ARM AND
HER SNOW SHOES UNDER THE OTHER
WHEN THEY HAVE A FOURTH OF JULY
PROCESSION IT GENERALLY SNOWS ON THEM AND THEY DO SAY THAT AS A GENERAL
THING WHEN A MAN CALLS FOR A BRANDY TODDY THERE THE BAR KEEPER CHOPS IT
OFF WITH A HATCHET AND WRAPS IT UP IN A PAPER LIKE MAPLE SUGAR
AND IT
IS FURTHER REPORTED THAT THE OLD SOAKERS HAVEN'T ANY TEETH WORE THEM OUT
EATING GIN COCKTAILS AND BRANDY PUNCHES
I DO NOT ENDORSE THAT
STATEMENT I SIMPLY GIVE IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH AND IT IS WORTH WELL
I SHOULD SAY MILLIONS TO ANY MAN WHO CAN BELIEVE IT WITHOUT STRAINING
HIMSELF
BUT I DO ENDORSE THE SNOW ON THE FOURTH OF JULY BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT TO BE TRUE
CHAPTER XXXIX
ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK ONE BLISTERING HOT MORNING FOR IT WAS NOW DEAD
SUMMER TIME HIGBIE AND I TOOK THE BOAT AND STARTED ON A VOYAGE OF
DISCOVERY TO THE TWO ISLANDS
WE HAD OFTEN LONGED TO DO THIS BUT HAD
BEEN DETERRED BY THE FEAR OF STORMS FOR THEY WERE FREQUENT AND SEVERE
ENOUGH TO CAPSIZE AN ORDINARY ROW BOAT LIKE OURS WITHOUT GREAT
DIFFICULTY AND ONCE CAPSIZED DEATH WOULD ENSUE IN SPITE OF THE BRAVEST
SWIMMING FOR THAT VENOMOUS WATER WOULD EAT A MAN'S EYES OUT LIKE FIRE
AND BURN HIM OUT INSIDE TOO IF HE SHIPPED A SEA
IT WAS CALLED TWELVE
MILES STRAIGHT OUT TO THE ISLANDS A LONG PULL AND A WARM ONE BUT THE
MORNING WAS SO QUIET AND SUNNY AND THE LAKE SO SMOOTH AND GLASSY AND
DEAD THAT WE COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION
SO WE FILLED TWO LARGE
TIN CANTEENS WITH WATER SINCE WE WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE LOCALITY
OF THE SPRING SAID TO EXIST ON THE LARGE ISLAND AND STARTED
HIGBIE'S
BRAWNY MUSCLES GAVE THE BOAT GOOD SPEED BUT BY THE TIME WE REACHED OUR
DESTINATION WE JUDGED THAT WE HAD PULLED NEARER FIFTEEN MILES THAN
TWELVE
WE LANDED ON THE BIG ISLAND AND WENT ASHORE
WE TRIED THE WATER IN THE
CANTEENS NOW AND FOUND THAT THE SUN HAD SPOILED IT IT WAS SO BRACKISH
THAT WE COULD NOT DRINK IT SO WE POURED IT OUT AND BEGAN A SEARCH FOR
THE SPRING FOR THIRST AUGMENTS FAST AS SOON AS IT IS APPARENT THAT ONE
HAS NO MEANS AT HAND OF QUENCHING IT
THE ISLAND WAS A LONG MODERATELY
HIGH HILL OF ASHES NOTHING BUT GRAY ASHES AND PUMICE STONE IN WHICH WE
SUNK TO OUR KNEES AT EVERY STEP AND ALL AROUND THE TOP WAS A FORBIDDING
WALL OF SCORCHED AND BLASTED ROCKS
WHEN WE REACHED THE TOP AND GOT
WITHIN THE WALL WE FOUND SIMPLY A SHALLOW FAR REACHING BASIN CARPETED
WITH ASHES AND HERE AND THERE A PATCH OF FINE SAND
IN PLACES
PICTURESQUE JETS OF STEAM SHOT UP OUT OF CREVICES GIVING EVIDENCE THAT
ALTHOUGH THIS ANCIENT CRATER HAD GONE OUT OF ACTIVE BUSINESS THERE WAS
STILL SOME FIRE LEFT IN ITS FURNACES
CLOSE TO ONE OF THESE JETS OF
STEAM STOOD THE ONLY TREE ON THE ISLAND A SMALL PINE OF MOST GRACEFUL
SHAPE AND MOST FAULTLESS SYMMETRY ITS COLOR WAS A BRILLIANT GREEN FOR
THE STEAM DRIFTED UNCEASINGLY THROUGH ITS BRANCHES AND KEPT THEM ALWAYS
MOIST
IT CONTRASTED STRANGELY ENOUGH DID THIS VIGOROUS AND BEAUTIFUL
OUTCAST WITH ITS DEAD AND DISMAL SURROUNDINGS
IT WAS LIKE A CHEERFUL
SPIRIT IN A MOURNING HOUSEHOLD
WE HUNTED FOR THE SPRING EVERYWHERE TRAVERSING THE FULL LENGTH OF THE
ISLAND TWO OR THREE MILES AND CROSSING IT TWICE CLIMBING ASH HILLS
PATIENTLY AND THEN SLIDING DOWN THE OTHER SIDE IN A SITTING POSTURE
PLOWING UP SMOTHERING VOLUMES OF GRAY DUST
BUT WE FOUND NOTHING BUT
SOLITUDE ASHES AND A HEART BREAKING SILENCE
FINALLY WE NOTICED THAT
THE WIND HAD RISEN AND WE FORGOT OUR THIRST IN A SOLICITUDE OF GREATER
IMPORTANCE FOR THE LAKE BEING QUIET WE HAD NOT TAKEN PAINS ABOUT
SECURING THE BOAT
WE HURRIED BACK TO A POINT OVERLOOKING OUR LANDING
PLACE AND THEN BUT MERE WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE OUR DISMAY THE BOAT WAS
GONE THE CHANCES WERE THAT THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER BOAT ON THE ENTIRE
LAKE
THE SITUATION WAS NOT COMFORTABLE IN TRUTH TO SPEAK PLAINLY IT
WAS FRIGHTFUL
WE WERE PRISONERS ON A DESOLATE ISLAND IN AGGRAVATING
PROXIMITY TO FRIENDS WHO WERE FOR THE PRESENT HELPLESS TO AID US AND
WHAT WAS STILL MORE UNCOMFORTABLE WAS THE REFLECTION THAT WE HAD NEITHER
FOOD NOR WATER
BUT PRESENTLY WE SIGHTED THE BOAT
IT WAS DRIFTING
ALONG LEISURELY ABOUT FIFTY YARDS FROM SHORE TOSSING IN A FOAMY SEA
IT DRIFTED AND CONTINUED TO DRIFT BUT AT THE SAME SAFE DISTANCE FROM
LAND AND WE WALKED ALONG ABREAST IT AND WAITED FOR FORTUNE TO FAVOR US
AT THE END OF AN HOUR IT APPROACHED A JUTTING CAPE AND HIGBIE RAN AHEAD
AND POSTED HIMSELF ON THE UTMOST VERGE AND PREPARED FOR THE ASSAULT
IF
WE FAILED THERE THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR US
IT WAS DRIVING GRADUALLY
SHOREWARD ALL THE TIME NOW BUT WHETHER IT WAS DRIVING FAST ENOUGH TO
MAKE THE CONNECTION OR NOT WAS THE MOMENTOUS QUESTION
WHEN IT GOT
WITHIN THIRTY STEPS OF HIGBIE I WAS SO EXCITED THAT I FANCIED I COULD
HEAR MY OWN HEART BEAT
WHEN A LITTLE LATER IT DRAGGED SLOWLY ALONG
AND SEEMED ABOUT TO GO BY ONLY ONE LITTLE YARD OUT OF REACH IT SEEMED
AS IF MY HEART STOOD STILL AND WHEN IT WAS EXACTLY ABREAST HIM AND BEGAN
TO WIDEN AWAY AND HE STILL STANDING LIKE A WATCHING STATUE I KNEW MY
HEART DID STOP
BUT WHEN HE GAVE A GREAT SPRING THE NEXT INSTANT AND
LIT FAIRLY IN THE STERN I DISCHARGED A WAR WHOOP THAT WOKE THE
SOLITUDES
BUT IT DULLED MY ENTHUSIASM PRESENTLY WHEN HE TOLD ME HE HAD NOT BEEN
CARING WHETHER THE BOAT CAME WITHIN JUMPING DISTANCE OR NOT SO THAT IT
PASSED WITHIN EIGHT OR TEN YARDS OF HIM FOR HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO
SHUT HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND SWIM THAT TRIFLING DISTANCE
IMBECILE THAT I
WAS I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THAT
IT WAS ONLY A LONG SWIM THAT COULD BE
FATAL
THE SEA WAS RUNNING HIGH AND THE STORM INCREASING
IT WAS GROWING LATE
TOO THREE OR FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON
WHETHER TO VENTURE TOWARD THE
MAINLAND OR NOT WAS A QUESTION OF SOME MOMENT
BUT WE WERE SO
DISTRESSED BY THIRST THAT WE DECIDE TO TRY IT AND SO HIGBIE FELL TO WORK
AND I TOOK THE STEERING OAR
WHEN WE HAD PULLED A MILE LABORIOUSLY
WE WERE EVIDENTLY IN SERIOUS PERIL FOR THE STORM HAD GREATLY AUGMENTED
THE BILLOWS RAN VERY HIGH AND WERE CAPPED WITH FOAMING CRESTS
THE HEAVENS WERE HUNG WITH BLACK AND THE WIND BLEW WITH GREAT FURY
WE WOULD HAVE GONE BACK NOW BUT WE DID NOT DARE TO TURN THE BOAT
AROUND BECAUSE AS SOON AS SHE GOT IN THE TROUGH OF THE SEA SHE WOULD
UPSET OF COURSE
OUR ONLY HOPE LAY IN KEEPING HER HEAD ON TO THE SEAS
IT WAS HARD WORK TO DO THIS SHE PLUNGED SO AND SO BEAT AND BELABORED
THE BILLOWS WITH HER RISING AND FALLING BOWS
NOW AND THEN ONE OF
HIGBIE'S OARS WOULD TRIP ON THE TOP OF A WAVE AND THE OTHER ONE WOULD
SNATCH THE BOAT HALF AROUND IN SPITE OF MY CUMBERSOME STEERING APPARATUS
WE WERE DRENCHED BY THE SPRAYS CONSTANTLY AND THE BOAT OCCASIONALLY
SHIPPED WATER
BY AND BY POWERFUL AS MY COMRADE WAS HIS GREAT
EXERTIONS BEGAN TO TELL ON HIM AND HE WAS ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD CHANGE
PLACES WITH HIM TILL HE COULD REST A LITTLE
BUT I TOLD HIM THIS WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR IF THE STEERING OAR WERE DROPPED A MOMENT WHILE WE
CHANGED THE BOAT WOULD SLUE AROUND INTO THE TROUGH OF THE SEA CAPSIZE
AND IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES WE WOULD HAVE A HUNDRED GALLONS OF
SOAP SUDS IN US AND BE EATEN UP SO QUICKLY THAT WE COULD NOT EVEN BE
PRESENT AT OUR OWN INQUEST
BUT THINGS CANNOT LAST ALWAYS
JUST AS THE DARKNESS SHUT DOWN WE CAME
BOOMING INTO PORT HEAD ON
HIGBIE DROPPED HIS OARS TO HURRAH I DROPPED
MINE TO HELP THE SEA GAVE THE BOAT A TWIST AND OVER SHE WENT
THE AGONY THAT ALKALI WATER INFLICTS ON BRUISES CHAFES AND BLISTERED
HANDS IS UNSPEAKABLE AND NOTHING BUT GREASING ALL OVER WILL MODIFY IT
BUT WE ATE DRANK AND SLEPT WELL THAT NIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING
IN SPEAKING OF THE PECULIARITIES OF MONO LAKE I OUGHT TO HAVE MENTIONED
THAT AT INTERVALS ALL AROUND ITS SHORES STAND PICTURESQUE TURRET LOOKING
MASSES AND CLUSTERS OF A WHITISH COARSE GRAINED ROCK THAT RESEMBLES
INFERIOR MORTAR DRIED HARD AND IF ONE BREAKS OFF FRAGMENTS OF THIS ROCK
HE WILL FIND PERFECTLY SHAPED AND THOROUGHLY PETRIFIED GULLS' EGGS DEEPLY
IMBEDDED IN THE MASS
HOW DID THEY GET THERE I SIMPLY STATE THE FACT
FOR IT IS A FACT AND LEAVE THE GEOLOGICAL READER TO CRACK THE NUT AT HIS
LEISURE AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM AFTER HIS OWN FASHION
AT THE END OF A WEEK WE ADJOURNED TO THE SIERRAS ON A FISHING EXCURSION
AND SPENT SEVERAL DAYS IN CAMP UNDER SNOWY CASTLE PEAK AND FISHED
SUCCESSFULLY FOR TROUT IN A BRIGHT MINIATURE LAKE WHOSE SURFACE WAS
BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA COOLING
OURSELVES DURING THE HOT AUGUST NOONS BY SITTING ON SNOW BANKS TEN FEET
DEEP UNDER WHOSE SHELTERING EDGES FINE GRASS AND DAINTY FLOWERS
FLOURISHED LUXURIOUSLY AND AT NIGHT ENTERTAINING OURSELVES BY ALMOST
FREEZING TO DEATH
THEN WE RETURNED TO MONO LAKE AND FINDING THAT THE
CEMENT EXCITEMENT WAS OVER FOR THE PRESENT PACKED UP AND WENT BACK TO
ESMERALDA
MR
BALLOU RECONNOITRED AWHILE AND NOT LIKING THE PROSPECT
SET OUT ALONE FOR HUMBOLDT
ABOUT THIS TIME OCCURRED A LITTLE INCIDENT WHICH HAS ALWAYS HAD A SORT OF
INTEREST TO ME FROM THE FACT THAT IT CAME SO NEAR INSTIGATING MY
FUNERAL
AT A TIME WHEN AN INDIAN ATTACK HAD BEEN EXPECTED THE CITIZENS
HID THEIR GUNPOWDER WHERE IT WOULD BE SAFE AND YET CONVENIENT TO HAND
WHEN WANTED
A NEIGHBOR OF OURS HID SIX CANS OF RIFLE POWDER IN THE
BAKE OVEN OF AN OLD DISCARDED COOKING STOVE WHICH STOOD ON THE OPEN
GROUND NEAR A FRAME OUT HOUSE OR SHED AND FROM AND AFTER THAT DAY NEVER
THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN
WE HIRED A HALF TAMED INDIAN TO DO SOME WASHING FOR
US AND HE TOOK UP QUARTERS UNDER THE SHED WITH HIS TUB
THE ANCIENT
STOVE REPOSED WITHIN SIX FEET OF HIM AND BEFORE HIS FACE
FINALLY IT
OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HOT WATER WOULD BE BETTER THAN COLD AND HE WENT OUT
AND FIRED UP UNDER THAT FORGOTTEN POWDER MAGAZINE AND SET ON A KETTLE OF
WATER
THEN HE RETURNED TO HIS TUB
I ENTERED THE SHED PRESENTLY AND THREW DOWN SOME MORE CLOTHES AND WAS
ABOUT TO SPEAK TO HIM WHEN THE STOVE BLEW UP WITH A PRODIGIOUS CRASH AND
DISAPPEARED LEAVING NOT A SPLINTER BEHIND
FRAGMENTS OF IT FELL IN THE
STREETS FULL TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
NEARLY A THIRD OF THE SHED ROOF
OVER OUR HEADS WAS DESTROYED AND ONE OF THE STOVE LIDS AFTER CUTTING A
SMALL STANCHION HALF IN TWO IN FRONT OF THE INDIAN WHIZZED BETWEEN US
AND DROVE PARTLY THROUGH THE WEATHER BOARDING BEYOND
I WAS AS WHITE AS
A SHEET AND AS WEAK AS A KITTEN AND SPEECHLESS
BUT THE INDIAN BETRAYED
NO TREPIDATION NO DISTRESS NOT EVEN DISCOMFORT
HE SIMPLY STOPPED
WASHING LEANED FORWARD AND SURVEYED THE CLEAN BLANK GROUND A MOMENT
AND THEN REMARKED
MPH DAM STOVE HEAP GONE AND RESUMED HIS SCRUBBING AS PLACIDLY AS IF
IT WERE AN ENTIRELY CUSTOMARY THING FOR A STOVE TO DO
I WILL EXPLAIN
THAT HEAP IS INJUN ENGLISH FOR VERY MUCH THE READER WILL PERCEIVE
THE EXHAUSTIVE EXPRESSIVENESS OF IT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE
CHAPTER XL
I NOW COME TO A CURIOUS EPISODE THE MOST CURIOUS I THINK THAT HAD YET
ACCENTED MY SLOTHFUL VALUELESS HEEDLESS CAREER
OUT OF A HILLSIDE
TOWARD THE UPPER END OF THE TOWN PROJECTED A WALL OF REDDISH LOOKING
QUARTZ CROPPINGS THE EXPOSED COMB OF A SILVER BEARING LEDGE THAT
EXTENDED DEEP DOWN INTO THE EARTH OF COURSE
IT WAS OWNED BY A COMPANY
ENTITLED THE WIDE WEST THERE WAS A SHAFT SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET DEEP
ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE CROPPINGS AND EVERYBODY WAS ACQUAINTED WITH THE
ROCK THAT CAME FROM IT AND TOLERABLY RICH ROCK IT WAS TOO BUT NOTHING
EXTRAORDINARY
I WILL REMARK HERE THAT ALTHOUGH TO THE INEXPERIENCED
STRANGER ALL THE QUARTZ OF A PARTICULAR DISTRICT LOOKS ABOUT ALIKE AN
OLD RESIDENT OF THE CAMP CAN TAKE A GLANCE AT A MIXED PILE OF ROCK
SEPARATE THE FRAGMENTS AND TELL YOU WHICH MINE EACH CAME FROM AS EASILY
AS A CONFECTIONER CAN SEPARATE AND CLASSIFY THE VARIOUS KINDS AND
QUALITIES OF CANDY IN A MIXED HEAP OF THE ARTICLE
ALL AT ONCE THE TOWN WAS THROWN INTO A STATE OF EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT
IN MINING PARLANCE THE WIDE WEST HAD STRUCK IT RICH EVERYBODY WENT TO
SEE THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND FOR SOME DAYS THERE WAS SUCH A CROWD OF
PEOPLE ABOUT THE WIDE WEST SHAFT THAT A STRANGER WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED
THERE WAS A MASS MEETING IN SESSION THERE
NO OTHER TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED
BUT THE RICH STRIKE AND NOBODY THOUGHT OR DREAMED ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE
EVERY MAN BROUGHT AWAY A SPECIMEN GROUND IT UP IN A HAND MORTAR WASHED
IT OUT IN HIS HORN SPOON AND GLARED SPEECHLESS UPON THE MARVELOUS
RESULT
IT WAS NOT HARD ROCK BUT BLACK DECOMPOSED STUFF WHICH COULD BE
CRUMBLED IN THE HAND LIKE A BAKED POTATO AND WHEN SPREAD OUT ON A PAPER
EXHIBITED A THICK SPRINKLING OF GOLD AND PARTICLES OF NATIVE SILVER
HIGBIE BROUGHT A HANDFUL TO THE CABIN AND WHEN HE HAD WASHED IT OUT HIS
AMAZEMENT WAS BEYOND DESCRIPTION
WIDE WEST STOCK SOARED SKYWARDS
IT
WAS SAID THAT REPEATED OFFERS HAD BEEN MADE FOR IT AT A THOUSAND DOLLARS
A FOOT AND PROMPTLY REFUSED
WE HAVE ALL HAD THE BLUES THE MERE
SKY BLUES BUT MINE WERE INDIGO NOW BECAUSE I DID NOT OWN IN THE WIDE
WEST
THE WORLD SEEMED HOLLOW TO ME AND EXISTENCE A GRIEF
I LOST MY
APPETITE AND CEASED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN ANYTHING
STILL I HAD TO
STAY AND LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S REJOICINGS BECAUSE I HAD NO MONEY TO
GET OUT OF THE CAMP WITH
THE WIDE WEST COMPANY PUT A STOP TO THE CARRYING AWAY OF SPECIMENS AND
WELL THEY MIGHT FOR EVERY HANDFUL OF THE ORE WAS WORTH A SUN OF SOME
CONSEQUENCE
TO SHOW THE EXCEEDING VALUE OF THE ORE I WILL REMARK THAT
A SIXTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS PARCEL OF IT WAS SOLD JUST AS IT LAY AT THE
MOUTH OF THE SHAFT AT ONE DOLLAR A POUND AND THE MAN WHO BOUGHT IT
PACKED IT ON MULES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED MILES OVER THE
MOUNTAINS TO SAN FRANCISCO SATISFIED THAT IT WOULD YIELD AT A RATE THAT
WOULD RICHLY COMPENSATE HIM FOR HIS TROUBLE
THE WIDE WEST PEOPLE ALSO
COMMANDED THEIR FOREMAN TO REFUSE ANY BUT THEIR OWN OPERATIVES PERMISSION
TO ENTER THE MINE AT ANY TIME OR FOR ANY PURPOSE
I KEPT UP MY BLUE
MEDITATIONS AND HIGBIE KEPT UP A DEAL OF THINKING TOO BUT OF A
DIFFERENT SORT
HE PUZZLED OVER THE ROCK EXAMINED IT WITH A GLASS
INSPECTED IT IN DIFFERENT LIGHTS AND FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW AND
AFTER EACH EXPERIMENT DELIVERED HIMSELF IN SOLILOQUY OF ONE AND THE
SAME UNVARYING OPINION IN THE SAME UNVARYING FORMULA
IT IS NOT WIDE WEST ROCK
HE SAID ONCE OR TWICE THAT HE MEANT TO HAVE A LOOK INTO THE WIDE WEST
SHAFT IF HE GOT SHOT FOR IT
I WAS WRETCHED AND DID NOT CARE WHETHER HE
GOT A LOOK INTO IT OR NOT
HE FAILED THAT DAY AND TRIED AGAIN AT NIGHT
FAILED AGAIN GOT UP AT DAWN AND TRIED AND FAILED AGAIN
THEN HE LAY IN
AMBUSH IN THE SAGE BRUSH HOUR AFTER HOUR WAITING FOR THE TWO OR THREE
HANDS TO ADJOURN TO THE SHADE OF A BOULDER FOR DINNER MADE A START ONCE
BUT WAS PREMATURE ONE OF THE MEN CAME BACK FOR SOMETHING TRIED IT
AGAIN BUT WHEN ALMOST AT THE MOUTH OF THE SHAFT ANOTHER OF THE MEN ROSE
UP FROM BEHIND THE BOULDER AS IF TO RECONNOITRE AND HE DROPPED ON THE
GROUND AND LAY QUIET PRESENTLY HE CRAWLED ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES TO THE
MOUTH OF THE SHAFT GAVE A QUICK GLANCE AROUND THEN SEIZED THE ROPE AND
SLID DOWN THE SHAFT
HE DISAPPEARED IN THE GLOOM OF A SIDE DRIFT JUST AS A HEAD APPEARED IN
THE MOUTH OF THE SHAFT AND SOMEBODY SHOUTED HELLO WHICH HE DID NOT
ANSWER
HE WAS NOT DISTURBED ANY MORE
AN HOUR LATER HE ENTERED THE
CABIN HOT RED AND READY TO BURST WITH SMOTHERED EXCITEMENT AND
EXCLAIMED IN A STAGE WHISPER
I KNEW IT WE ARE RICH IT'S A BLIND LEAD
I THOUGHT THE VERY EARTH REELED UNDER ME
DOUBT CONVICTION DOUBT
AGAIN EXULTATION HOPE AMAZEMENT BELIEF UNBELIEF EVERY EMOTION
IMAGINABLE SWEPT IN WILD PROCESSION THROUGH MY HEART AND BRAIN AND I
COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
AFTER A MOMENT OR TWO OF THIS MENTAL FURY I
SHOOK MYSELF TO RIGHTS AND SAID
SAY IT AGAIN
IT'S BLIND LEAD
CAL LET'S LET'S BURN THE HOUSE OR KILL SOMEBODY LET'S GET OUT WHERE
THERE'S ROOM TO HURRAH BUT WHAT IS THE USE IT IS A HUNDRED TIMES TOO
GOOD TO BE TRUE
IT'S A BLIND LEAD FOR A MILLION HANGING WALL FOOT WALL CLAY
CASINGS EVERYTHING COMPLETE HE SWUNG HIS HAT AND GAVE THREE CHEERS
AND I CAST DOUBT TO THE WINDS AND CHIMED IN WITH A WILL
FOR I WAS WORTH
A MILLION DOLLARS AND DID NOT CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT
BUT PERHAPS I OUGHT TO EXPLAIN
A BLIND LEAD IS A LEAD OR LEDGE THAT
DOES NOT CROP OUT ABOVE THE SURFACE
A MINER DOES NOT KNOW WHERE TO
LOOK FOR SUCH LEADS BUT THEY ARE OFTEN STUMBLED UPON BY ACCIDENT IN THE
COURSE OF DRIVING A TUNNEL OR SINKING A SHAFT
HIGBIE KNEW THE WIDE WEST
ROCK PERFECTLY WELL AND THE MORE HE HAD EXAMINED THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS
THE MORE HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE ORE COULD NOT HAVE COME FROM THE WIDE
WEST VEIN
AND SO HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM ALONE OF ALL THE CAMP THAT
THERE WAS A BLIND LEAD DOWN IN THE SHAFT AND THAT EVEN THE WIDE WEST
PEOPLE THEMSELVES DID NOT SUSPECT IT
HE WAS RIGHT
WHEN HE WENT DOWN
THE SHAFT HE FOUND THAT THE BLIND LEAD HELD ITS INDEPENDENT WAY THROUGH
THE WIDE WEST VEIN CUTTING IT DIAGONALLY AND THAT IT WAS ENCLOSED IN
ITS OWN WELL DEFINED CASING ROCKS AND CLAY
HENCE IT WAS PUBLIC
PROPERTY
BOTH LEADS BEING PERFECTLY WELL DEFINED IT WAS EASY FOR ANY
MINER TO SEE WHICH ONE BELONGED TO THE WIDE WEST AND WHICH DID NOT
WE THOUGHT IT WELL TO HAVE A STRONG FRIEND AND THEREFORE WE BROUGHT THE
FOREMAN OF THE WIDE WEST TO OUR CABIN THAT NIGHT AND REVEALED THE GREAT
SURPRISE TO HIM
HIGBIE SAID
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THIS BLIND LEAD RECORD IT AND
ESTABLISH OWNERSHIP AND THEN FORBID THE WIDE WEST COMPANY TO TAKE OUT
ANY MORE OF THE ROCK
YOU CANNOT HELP YOUR COMPANY IN THIS MATTER
NOBODY CAN HELP THEM
I WILL GO INTO THE SHAFT WITH YOU AND PROVE TO
YOUR ENTIRE SATISFACTION THAT IT IS A BLIND LEAD
NOW WE PROPOSE TO TAKE
YOU IN WITH US AND CLAIM THE BLIND LEAD IN OUR THREE NAMES
WHAT DO YOU
SAY
WHAT COULD A MAN SAY WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIMPLY STRETCH FORTH HIS
HAND AND TAKE POSSESSION OF A FORTUNE WITHOUT RISK OF ANY KIND AND
WITHOUT WRONGING ANY ONE OR ATTACHING THE LEAST TAINT OF DISHONOR TO HIS
NAME HE COULD ONLY SAY AGREED
THE NOTICE WAS PUT UP THAT NIGHT AND DULY SPREAD UPON THE RECORDER'S
BOOKS BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK
WE CLAIMED TWO HUNDRED FEET EACH SIX HUNDRED
FEET IN ALL THE SMALLEST AND COMPACTEST ORGANIZATION IN THE DISTRICT
AND THE EASIEST TO MANAGE
NO ONE CAN BE SO THOUGHTLESS AS TO SUPPOSE THAT WE SLEPT THAT NIGHT
HIGBIE AND I WENT TO BED AT MIDNIGHT BUT IT WAS ONLY TO LIE BROAD AWAKE
AND THINK DREAM SCHEME
THE FLOORLESS TUMBLE DOWN CABIN WAS A PALACE
THE RAGGED GRAY BLANKETS SILK THE FURNITURE ROSEWOOD AND MAHOGANY
EACH NEW SPLENDOR THAT BURST OUT OF MY VISIONS OF THE FUTURE WHIRLED ME
BODILY OVER IN BED OR JERKED ME TO A SITTING POSTURE JUST AS IF AN
ELECTRIC BATTERY HAD BEEN APPLIED TO ME
WE SHOT FRAGMENTS OF
CONVERSATION BACK AND FORTH AT EACH OTHER
ONCE HIGBIE SAID
WHEN ARE YOU GOING HOME TO THE STATES
TO MORROW WITH AN EVOLUTION OR TWO ENDING WITH A SITTING POSITION
WELL NO BUT NEXT MONTH AT FURTHEST
WE'LL GO IN THE SAME STEAMER
AGREED
A PAUSE
STEAMER OF THE 10TH
YES
NO THE 1ST
ALL RIGHT
ANOTHER PAUSE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE SAID HIGBIE
SAN FRANCISCO
THAT'S ME
PAUSE
TOO HIGH TOO MUCH CLIMBING FROM HIGBIE
WHAT IS
I WAS THINKING OF RUSSIAN HILL BUILDING A HOUSE UP THERE
TOO MUCH CLIMBING SHAN'T YOU KEEP A CARRIAGE
OF COURSE
I FORGOT THAT
PAUSE
CAL WHAT KIND OF A HOUSE ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT
THREE STORY AND AN ATTIC
BUT WHAT KIND
WELL I DON'T HARDLY KNOW
BRICK I SUPPOSE
BRICK BOSH

A LONG PAUSE
CAL WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO EUROPE
WELL I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT
WHEN ARE YOU
IN THE SPRING
GOING TO BE GONE ALL SUMMER
ALL SUMMER I SHALL REMAIN THERE THREE YEARS
NO BUT ARE YOU IN EARNEST
INDEED I AM
I WILL GO ALONG TOO
WHY OF COURSE YOU WILL
WHAT PART OF EUROPE SHALL YOU GO TO
ALL PARTS
FRANCE ENGLAND GERMANY SPAIN ITALY SWITZERLAND SYRIA
GREECE PALESTINE ARABIA PERSIA EGYPT ALL OVER EVERYWHERE
I'M AGREED
ALL RIGHT
WON'T IT BE A SWELL TRIP
WE'LL SPEND FORTY OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TRYING TO MAKE IT ONE
ANYWAY
ANOTHER LONG PAUSE
HIGBIE WE OWE THE BUTCHER SIX DOLLARS AND HE HAS BEEN THREATENING TO
STOP OUR
HANG THE BUTCHER
AMEN
AND SO IT WENT ON
BY THREE O'CLOCK WE FOUND IT WAS NO USE AND SO WE
GOT UP AND PLAYED CRIBBAGE AND SMOKED PIPES TILL SUNRISE
IT WAS MY WEEK
TO COOK
I ALWAYS HATED COOKING NOW I ABHORRED IT
THE NEWS WAS ALL OVER TOWN
THE FORMER EXCITEMENT WAS GREAT THIS ONE
WAS GREATER STILL
I WALKED THE STREETS SERENE AND HAPPY
HIGBIE SAID
THE FOREMAN HAD BEEN OFFERED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR HIS THIRD
OF THE MINE
I SAID I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MYSELF SELLING FOR ANY SUCH
PRICE
MY IDEAS WERE LOFTY
MY FIGURE WAS A MILLION
STILL I HONESTLY
BELIEVE THAT IF I HAD BEEN OFFERED IT IT WOULD HAVE HAD NO OTHER EFFECT
THAN TO MAKE ME HOLD OFF FOR MORE
I FOUND ABUNDANT ENJOYMENT IN BEING RICH
A MAN OFFERED ME A
THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR HORSE AND WANTED TO TAKE MY SIMPLE UNENDORSED NOTE
FOR IT
THAT BROUGHT THE MOST REALIZING SENSE I HAD YET HAD THAT I WAS
ACTUALLY RICH BEYOND SHADOW OF DOUBT
IT WAS FOLLOWED BY NUMEROUS OTHER
EVIDENCES OF A SIMILAR NATURE AMONG WHICH I MAY MENTION THE FACT OF THE
BUTCHER LEAVING US A DOUBLE SUPPLY OF MEAT AND SAYING NOTHING ABOUT
MONEY
BY THE LAWS OF THE DISTRICT THE LOCATORS OR CLAIMANTS OF A LEDGE WERE
OBLIGED TO DO A FAIR AND REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WORK ON THEIR NEW PROPERTY
WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF THE LOCATION OR THE PROPERTY WAS
FORFEITED AND ANYBODY COULD GO AND SEIZE IT THAT CHOSE
SO WE
DETERMINED TO GO TO WORK THE NEXT DAY
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE
AFTERNOON AS I WAS COMING OUT OF THE POST OFFICE I MET A MR
GARDINER
WHO TOLD ME THAT CAPT
JOHN NYE WAS LYING DANGEROUSLY ILL AT HIS PLACE
THE NINE MILE RANCH AND THAT HE AND HIS WIFE WERE NOT ABLE TO GIVE
HIM NEARLY AS MUCH CARE AND ATTENTION AS HIS CASE DEMANDED
I SAID IF HE
WOULD WAIT FOR ME A MOMENT I WOULD GO DOWN AND HELP IN THE SICK ROOM
I RAN TO THE CABIN TO TELL HIGBIE
HE WAS NOT THERE BUT I LEFT A NOTE
ON THE TABLE FOR HIM AND A FEW MINUTES LATER I LEFT TOWN IN GARDINER'S
WAGON
CHAPTER XLI
CAPTAIN NYE WAS VERY ILL INDEED WITH SPASMODIC RHEUMATISM
BUT THE OLD
GENTLEMAN WAS HIMSELF WHICH IS TO SAY HE WAS KIND HEARTED AND AGREEABLE
WHEN COMFORTABLE BUT A SINGULARLY VIOLENT WILD CAT WHEN THINGS DID NOT
GO WELL
HE WOULD BE SMILING ALONG PLEASANTLY ENOUGH WHEN A SUDDEN
SPASM OF HIS DISEASE WOULD TAKE HIM AND HE WOULD GO OUT OF HIS SMILE INTO
A PERFECT FURY
HE WOULD GROAN AND WAIL AND HOWL WITH THE ANGUISH AND
FILL UP THE ODD CHINKS WITH THE MOST ELABORATE PROFANITY THAT STRONG
CONVICTIONS AND A FINE FANCY COULD CONTRIVE
WITH FAIR OPPORTUNITY HE
COULD SWEAR VERY WELL AND HANDLE HIS ADJECTIVES WITH CONSIDERABLE
JUDGMENT BUT WHEN THE SPASM WAS ON HIM IT WAS PAINFUL TO LISTEN TO HIM
HE WAS SO AWKWARD
HOWEVER I HAD SEEN HIM NURSE A SICK MAN HIMSELF AND
PUT UP PATIENTLY WITH THE INCONVENIENCES OF THE SITUATION AND
CONSEQUENTLY I WAS WILLING THAT HE SHOULD HAVE FULL LICENSE NOW THAT HIS
OWN TURN HAD COME
HE COULD NOT DISTURB ME WITH ALL HIS RAVING AND
RANTING FOR MY MIND HAD WORK ON HAND AND IT LABORED ON DILIGENTLY
NIGHT AND DAY WHETHER MY HANDS WERE IDLE OR EMPLOYED
I WAS ALTERING
AND AMENDING THE PLANS FOR MY HOUSE AND THINKING OVER THE PROPRIETY OF
HAVING THE BILLARD ROOM IN THE ATTIC INSTEAD OF ON THE SAME FLOOR WITH
THE DINING ROOM ALSO I WAS TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN GREEN AND BLUE FOR
THE UPHOLSTERY OF THE DRAWING ROOM FOR ALTHOUGH MY PREFERENCE WAS BLUE
I FEARED IT WAS A COLOR THAT WOULD BE TOO EASILY DAMAGED BY DUST AND
SUNLIGHT LIKEWISE WHILE I WAS CONTENT TO PUT THE COACHMAN IN A MODEST
LIVERY I WAS UNCERTAIN ABOUT A FOOTMAN I NEEDED ONE AND WAS EVEN
RESOLVED TO HAVE ONE BUT WISHED HE COULD PROPERLY APPEAR AND PERFORM HIS
FUNCTIONS OUT OF LIVERY FOR I SOMEWHAT DREADED SO MUCH SHOW AND YET
INASMUCH AS MY LATE GRANDFATHER HAD HAD A COACHMAN AND SUCH THINGS BUT
NO LIVERIES I FELT RATHER DRAWN TO BEAT HIM OR BEAT HIS GHOST AT ANY
RATE I WAS ALSO SYSTEMATIZING THE EUROPEAN TRIP AND MANAGED TO GET IT
ALL LAID OUT AS TO ROUTE AND LENGTH OF TIME TO BE DEVOTED TO IT
EVERYTHING WITH ONE EXCEPTION NAMELY WHETHER TO CROSS THE DESERT FROM
CAIRO TO JERUSALEM PER CAMEL OR GO BY SEA TO BEIRUT AND THENCE DOWN
THROUGH THE COUNTRY PER CARAVAN
MEANTIME I WAS WRITING TO THE FRIENDS
AT HOME EVERY DAY INSTRUCTING THEM CONCERNING ALL MY PLANS AND
INTENTIONS AND DIRECTING THEM TO LOOK UP A HANDSOME HOMESTEAD FOR MY
MOTHER AND AGREE UPON A PRICE FOR IT AGAINST MY COMING AND ALSO
DIRECTING THEM TO SELL MY SHARE OF THE TENNESSEE LAND AND TENDER THE
PROCEEDS TO THE WIDOWS' AND ORPHANS' FUND OF THE TYPOGRAPHICAL UNION OF
WHICH I HAD LONG BEEN A MEMBER IN GOOD STANDING
THIS TENNESSEE LAND
HAD BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF THE FAMILY MANY YEARS AND PROMISED TO
CONFER HIGH FORTUNE UPON US SOME DAY IT STILL PROMISES IT BUT IN A LESS
VIOLENT WAY
WHEN I HAD BEEN NURSING THE CAPTAIN NINE DAYS HE WAS SOMEWHAT BETTER
BUT VERY FEEBLE
DURING THE AFTERNOON WE LIFTED HIM INTO A CHAIR AND
GAVE HIM AN ALCOHOLIC VAPOR BATH AND THEN SET ABOUT PUTTING HIM ON THE
BED AGAIN
WE HAD TO BE EXCEEDINGLY CAREFUL FOR THE LEAST JAR PRODUCED
PAIN
GARDINER HAD HIS SHOULDERS AND I HIS LEGS IN AN UNFORTUNATE
MOMENT I STUMBLED AND THE PATIENT FELL HEAVILY ON THE BED IN AN AGONY OF
TORTURE
I NEVER HEARD A MAN SWEAR SO IN MY LIFE
HE RAVED LIKE A
MANIAC AND TRIED TO SNATCH A REVOLVER FROM THE TABLE BUT I GOT IT
HE ORDERED ME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SWORE A WORLD OF OATHS THAT HE WOULD
KILL ME WHEREVER HE CAUGHT ME WHEN HE GOT ON HIS FEET AGAIN
IT WAS
SIMPLY A PASSING FURY AND MEANT NOTHING
I KNEW HE WOULD FORGET IT IN
AN HOUR AND MAYBE BE SORRY FOR IT TOO BUT IT ANGERED ME A LITTLE AT
THE MOMENT
SO MUCH SO INDEED THAT I DETERMINED TO GO BACK TO
ESMERALDA
I THOUGHT HE WAS ABLE TO GET ALONG ALONE NOW SINCE HE WAS
ON THE WAR PATH
I TOOK SUPPER AND AS SOON AS THE MOON ROSE BEGAN MY
NINE MILE JOURNEY ON FOOT
EVEN MILLIONAIRES NEEDED NO HORSES IN THOSE DAYS FOR A MERE NINE MILE
JAUNT WITHOUT BAGGAGE
AS I RAISED THE HILL OVERLOOKING THE TOWN IT LACKED FIFTEEN MINUTES OF
TWELVE
I GLANCED AT THE HILL OVER BEYOND THE CANYON AND IN THE BRIGHT
MOONLIGHT SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT HALF THE POPULATION OF THE
VILLAGE MASSED ON AND AROUND THE WIDE WEST CROPPINGS
MY HEART GAVE AN
EXULTING BOUND AND I SAID TO MYSELF THEY HAVE MADE A NEW STRIKE
TO NIGHT AND STRUCK IT RICHER THAN EVER NO DOUBT I STARTED OVER
THERE BUT GAVE IT UP
I SAID THE STRICK WOULD KEEP AND I HAD CLIMBED
HILL ENOUGH FOR ONE NIGHT
I WENT ON DOWN THROUGH THE TOWN AND AS I WAS
PASSING A LITTLE GERMAN BAKERY A WOMAN RAN OUT AND BEGGED ME TO COME IN
AND HELP HER
SHE SAID HER HUSBAND HAD A FIT
I WENT IN AND JUDGED SHE
WAS RIGHT HE APPEARED TO HAVE A HUNDRED OF THEM COMPRESSED INTO ONE
TWO GERMANS WERE THERE TRYING TO HOLD HIM AND NOT MAKING MUCH OF A
SUCCESS OF IT
I RAN UP THE STREET HALF A BLOCK OR SO AND ROUTED OUT A
SLEEPING DOCTOR BROUGHT HIM DOWN HALF DRESSED AND WE FOUR WRESTLED WITH
THE MANIAC AND DOCTORED DRENCHED AND BLED HIM FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR
AND THE POOR GERMAN WOMAN DID THE CRYING
HE GREW QUIET NOW AND THE
DOCTOR AND I WITHDREW AND LEFT HIM TO HIS FRIENDS
IT WAS A LITTLE AFTER ONE O'CLOCK
AS I ENTERED THE CABIN DOOR TIRED
BUT JOLLY THE DINGY LIGHT OF A TALLOW CANDLE REVEALED HIGBIE SITTING BY
THE PINE TABLE GAZING STUPIDLY AT MY NOTE WHICH HE HELD IN HIS FINGERS
AND LOOKING PALE OLD AND HAGGARD
I HALTED AND LOOKED AT HIM
HE
LOOKED AT ME STOLIDLY
I SAID
HIGBIE WHAT WHAT IS IT
WE'RE RUINED WE DIDN'T DO THE WORK THE BLIND LEAD'S RELOCATED
IT WAS ENOUGH
I SAT DOWN SICK GRIEVED BROKEN HEARTED INDEED
A
MINUTE BEFORE I WAS RICH AND BRIMFUL OF VANITY I WAS A PAUPER NOW AND
VERY MEEK
WE SAT STILL AN HOUR BUSY WITH THOUGHT BUSY WITH VAIN AND
USELESS SELF UPBRAIDINGS BUSY WITH WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS AND WHY DIDN'T
I DO THAT BUT NEITHER SPOKE A WORD
THEN WE DROPPED INTO MUTUAL
EXPLANATIONS AND THE MYSTERY WAS CLEARED AWAY
IT CAME OUT THAT HIGBIE
HAD DEPENDED ON ME AS I HAD ON HIM AND AS BOTH OF US HAD ON THE
FOREMAN
THE FOLLY OF IT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT EVER STAID AND
STEADFAST HIGBIE HAD LEFT AN IMPORTANT MATTER TO CHANCE OR FAILED TO BE
TRUE TO HIS FULL SHARE OF A RESPONSIBILITY
BUT HE HAD NEVER SEEN MY NOTE TILL THIS MOMENT AND THIS MOMENT WAS THE
FIRST TIME HE HAD BEEN IN THE CABIN SINCE THE DAY HE HAD SEEN ME LAST
HE ALSO HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR ME ON THAT SAME FATAL AFTERNOON HAD
RIDDEN UP ON HORSEBACK AND LOOKED THROUGH THE WINDOW AND BEING IN A
HURRY AND NOT SEEING ME HAD TOSSED THE NOTE INTO THE CABIN THROUGH A
BROKEN PANE
HERE IT WAS ON THE FLOOR WHERE IT HAD REMAINED
UNDISTURBED FOR NINE DAYS
DON'T FAIL TO DO THE WORK BEFORE THE TEN DAYS EXPIRE
W
HAS PASSED THROUGH AND GIVEN ME NOTICE
I AM TO JOIN HIM AT
MONO LAKE AND WE SHALL GO ON FROM THERE TO NIGHT
HE SAYS
HE WILL FIND IT THIS TIME SURE
CAL
W MEANT WHITEMAN OF COURSE
THAT THRICE ACCURSED CEMENT
THAT WAS THE WAY OF IT
AN OLD MINER LIKE HIGBIE COULD NO MORE
WITHSTAND THE FASCINATION OF A MYSTERIOUS MINING EXCITEMENT LIKE THIS
CEMENT FOOLISHNESS THAN HE COULD REFRAIN FROM EATING WHEN HE WAS
FAMISHING
HIGBIE HAD BEEN DREAMING ABOUT THE MARVELOUS CEMENT FOR
MONTHS AND NOW AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT HE HAD GONE OFF AND TAKEN
THE CHANCES ON MY KEEPING SECURE A MINE WORTH A MILLION UNDISCOVERED
CEMENT VEINS
THEY HAD NOT BEEN FOLLOWED THIS TIME
HIS RIDING OUT OF
TOWN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT WAS SUCH A COMMON PLACE THING TO DO THAT IT HAD
NOT ATTRACTED ANY ATTENTION
HE SAID THEY PROSECUTED THEIR SEARCH IN THE
FASTNESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS DURING NINE DAYS WITHOUT SUCCESS THEY COULD
NOT FIND THE CEMENT
THEN A GHASTLY FEAR CAME OVER HIM THAT SOMETHING
MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO PREVENT THE DOING OF THE NECESSARY WORK TO HOLD
THE BLIND LEAD THOUGH INDEED HE THOUGHT SUCH A THING HARDLY POSSIBLE
AND FORTHWITH HE STARTED HOME WITH ALL SPEED
HE WOULD HAVE REACHED
ESMERALDA IN TIME BUT HIS HORSE BROKE DOWN AND HE HAD TO WALK A GREAT
PART OF THE DISTANCE
AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT AS HE CAME INTO ESMERALDA
BY ONE ROAD I ENTERED IT BY ANOTHER
HIS WAS THE SUPERIOR ENERGY
HOWEVER FOR HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE WIDE WEST INSTEAD OF TURNING ASIDE
AS I HAD DONE AND HE ARRIVED THERE ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES TOO LATE
THE NOTICE WAS ALREADY UP THE RELOCATION OF OUR MINE COMPLETED
BEYOND RECALL AND THE CROWD RAPIDLY DISPERSING
HE LEARNED SOME FACTS
BEFORE HE LEFT THE GROUND
THE FOREMAN HAD NOT BEEN SEEN ABOUT THE
STREETS SINCE THE NIGHT WE HAD LOCATED THE MINE A TELEGRAM HAD CALLED
HIM TO CALIFORNIA ON A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH IT WAS SAID
AT ANY
RATE HE HAD DONE NO WORK AND THE WATCHFUL EYES OF THE COMMUNITY WERE
TAKING NOTE OF THE FACT
AT MIDNIGHT OF THIS WOFUL TENTH DAY THE LEDGE
WOULD BE RELOCATABLE AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE HILL WAS BLACK WITH MEN
PREPARED TO DO THE RELOCATING
THAT WAS THE CROWD I HAD SEEN WHEN I
FANCIED A NEW STRIKE HAD BEEN MADE IDIOT THAT I WAS
WE THREE HAD THE SAME RIGHT TO RELOCATE THE LEAD THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAD
PROVIDED WE WERE QUICK ENOUGH AS MIDNIGHT WAS ANNOUNCED FOURTEEN MEN
DULY ARMED AND READY TO BACK THEIR PROCEEDINGS PUT UP THEIR NOTICE AND
PROCLAIMED THEIR OWNERSHIP OF THE BLIND LEAD UNDER THE NEW NAME OF THE
JOHNSON BUT A
D
ALLEN OUR PARTNER THE FOREMAN PUT IN A SUDDEN
APPEARANCE ABOUT THAT TIME WITH A COCKED REVOLVER IN HIS HAND AND SAID
HIS NAME MUST BE ADDED TO THE LIST OR HE WOULD THIN OUT THE JOHNSON
COMPANY SOME HE WAS A MANLY SPLENDID DETERMINED FELLOW AND KNOWN TO
BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AND THEREFORE A COMPROMISE WAS EFFECTED
THEY
PUT IN HIS NAME FOR A HUNDRED FEET RESERVING TO THEMSELVES THE CUSTOMARY
TWO HUNDRED FEET EACH
SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF THE NIGHT'S EVENTS AS
HIGBIE GATHERED FROM A FRIEND ON THE WAY HOME
HIGBIE AND I CLEARED OUT ON A NEW MINING EXCITEMENT THE NEXT MORNING
GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF OUR SUFFERINGS AND AFTER A MONTH OR
TWO OF HARDSHIP AND DISAPPOINTMENT RETURNED TO ESMERALDA ONCE MORE
THEN WE LEARNED THAT THE WIDE WEST AND THE JOHNSON COMPANIES HAD
CONSOLIDATED THAT THE STOCK THUS UNITED COMPRISED FIVE THOUSAND FEET
OR SHARES THAT THE FOREMAN APPREHENDING TIRESOME LITIGATION AND
CONSIDERING SUCH A HUGE CONCERN UNWIELDY HAD SOLD HIS HUNDRED FEET FOR
NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GOLD AND GONE HOME TO THE STATES TO ENJOY IT
IF THE STOCK WAS WORTH SUCH A GALLANT FIGURE WITH FIVE THOUSAND SHARES
IN THE CORPORATION IT MAKES ME DIZZY TO THINK WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
WORTH WITH ONLY OUR ORIGINAL SIX HUNDRED IN IT
IT WAS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED MEN OWNING A HOUSE AND FIVE THOUSAND OWNING IT
WE
WOULD HAVE BEEN MILLIONAIRES IF WE HAD ONLY WORKED WITH PICK AND SPADE
ONE LITTLE DAY ON OUR PROPERTY AND SO SECURED OUR OWNERSHIP
IT READS LIKE A WILD FANCY SKETCH BUT THE EVIDENCE OF MANY WITNESSES
AND LIKEWISE THAT OF THE OFFICIAL RECORDS OF ESMERALDA DISTRICT IS
EASILY OBTAINABLE IN PROOF THAT IT IS A TRUE HISTORY
I CAN ALWAYS HAVE
IT TO SAY THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY AND UNQUESTIONABLY WORTH A MILLION
DOLLARS ONCE FOR TEN DAYS
A YEAR AGO MY ESTEEMED AND IN EVERY WAY ESTIMABLE OLD MILLIONAIRE
PARTNER HIGBIE WROTE ME FROM AN OBSCURE LITTLE MINING CAMP IN
CALIFORNIA THAT AFTER NINE OR TEN YEARS OF BUFFETINGS AND HARD STRIVING
HE WAS AT LAST IN A POSITION WHERE HE COULD COMMAND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED
DOLLARS AND SAID HE MEANT TO GO INTO THE FRUIT BUSINESS IN A MODEST WAY
HOW SUCH A THOUGHT WOULD HAVE INSULTED HIM THE NIGHT WE LAY IN OUR CABIN
PLANNING EUROPEAN TRIPS AND BROWN STONE HOUSES ON RUSSIAN HILL
CHAPTER XLII
WHAT TO DO NEXT
IT WAS A MOMENTOUS QUESTION
I HAD GONE OUT INTO THE WORLD TO SHIFT FOR
MYSELF AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN FOR MY FATHER HAD ENDORSED FOR FRIENDS
AND ALTHOUGH HE LEFT US A SUMPTUOUS LEGACY OF PRIDE IN HIS FINE VIRGINIAN
STOCK AND ITS NATIONAL DISTINCTION I PRESENTLY FOUND THAT I COULD NOT
LIVE ON THAT ALONE WITHOUT OCCASIONAL BREAD TO WASH IT DOWN WITH
I HAD
GAINED A LIVELIHOOD IN VARIOUS VOCATIONS BUT HAD NOT DAZZLED ANYBODY
WITH MY SUCCESSES STILL THE LIST WAS BEFORE ME AND THE AMPLEST LIBERTY
IN THE MATTER OF CHOOSING PROVIDED I WANTED TO WORK WHICH I DID NOT
AFTER BEING SO WEALTHY
I HAD ONCE BEEN A GROCERY CLERK FOR ONE DAY
BUT HAD CONSUMED SO MUCH SUGAR IN THAT TIME THAT I WAS RELIEVED FROM
FURTHER DUTY BY THE PROPRIETOR SAID HE WANTED ME OUTSIDE SO THAT HE
COULD HAVE MY CUSTOM
I HAD STUDIED LAW AN ENTIRE WEEK AND THEN GIVEN
IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS SO PROSY AND TIRESOME
I HAD ENGAGED BRIEFLY IN THE
STUDY OF BLACKSMITHING BUT WASTED SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO FIX THE BELLOWS
SO THAT IT WOULD BLOW ITSELF THAT THE MASTER TURNED ME ADRIFT IN
DISGRACE AND TOLD ME I WOULD COME TO NO GOOD
I HAD BEEN A BOOKSELLER'S
CLERK FOR AWHILE BUT THE CUSTOMERS BOTHERED ME SO MUCH I COULD NOT READ
WITH ANY COMFORT AND SO THE PROPRIETOR GAVE ME A FURLOUGH AND FORGOT TO
PUT A LIMIT TO IT
I HAD CLERKED IN A DRUG STORE PART OF A SUMMER BUT
MY PRESCRIPTIONS WERE UNLUCKY AND WE APPEARED TO SELL MORE STOMACH PUMPS
THAN SODA WATER
SO I HAD TO GO
I HAD MADE OF MYSELF A TOLERABLE
PRINTER UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WOULD BE ANOTHER FRANKLIN SOME DAY
BUT SOMEHOW HAD MISSED THE CONNECTION THUS FAR
THERE WAS NO BERTH OPEN
IN THE ESMERALDA UNION AND BESIDES I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A SLOW
COMPOSITOR THAT I LOOKED WITH ENVY UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF APPRENTICES
OF TWO YEARS' STANDING AND WHEN I TOOK A TAKE FOREMEN WERE IN THE
HABIT OF SUGGESTING THAT IT WOULD BE WANTED SOME TIME DURING THE YEAR
I WAS A GOOD AVERAGE ST
LOUIS AND NEW ORLEANS PILOT AND BY NO MEANS
ASHAMED OF MY ABILITIES IN THAT LINE WAGES WERE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
DOLLARS A MONTH AND NO BOARD TO PAY AND I DID LONG TO STAND BEHIND A
WHEEL AGAIN AND NEVER ROAM ANY MORE BUT I HAD BEEN MAKING SUCH AN ASS OF
MYSELF LATELY IN GRANDILOQUENT LETTERS HOME ABOUT MY BLIND LEAD AND MY
EUROPEAN EXCURSION THAT I DID WHAT MANY AND MANY A POOR DISAPPOINTED
MINER HAD DONE BEFORE SAID IT IS ALL OVER WITH ME NOW AND I WILL NEVER
GO BACK HOME TO BE PITIED AND SNUBBED I HAD BEEN A PRIVATE SECRETARY
A SILVER MINER AND A SILVER MILL OPERATIVE AND AMOUNTED TO LESS THAN
NOTHING IN EACH AND NOW
WHAT TO DO NEXT
I YIELDED TO HIGBIE'S APPEALS AND CONSENTED TO TRY THE MINING ONCE MORE
WE CLIMBED FAR UP ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AND WENT TO WORK ON A LITTLE
RUBBISHY CLAIM OF OURS THAT HAD A SHAFT ON IT EIGHT FEET DEEP
HIGBIE
DESCENDED INTO IT AND WORKED BRAVELY WITH HIS PICK TILL HE HAD LOOSENED
UP A DEAL OF ROCK AND DIRT AND THEN I WENT DOWN WITH A LONG HANDLED
SHOVEL THE MOST AWKWARD INVENTION YET CONTRIVED BY MAN TO THROW IT OUT
YOU MUST BRACE THE SHOVEL FORWARD WITH THE SIDE OF YOUR KNEE TILL IT IS
FULL AND THEN WITH A SKILFUL TOSS THROW IT BACKWARD OVER YOUR LEFT
SHOULDER
I MADE THE TOSS AND LANDED THE MESS JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE
SHAFT AND IT ALL CAME BACK ON MY HEAD AND DOWN THE BACK OF MY NECK
I NEVER SAID A WORD BUT CLIMBED OUT AND WALKED HOME
I INWARDLY
RESOLVED THAT I WOULD STARVE BEFORE I WOULD MAKE A TARGET OF MYSELF AND
SHOOT RUBBISH AT IT WITH A LONG HANDLED SHOVEL
I SAT DOWN IN THE CABIN AND GAVE MYSELF UP TO SOLID MISERY SO TO
SPEAK
NOW IN PLEASANTER DAYS I HAD AMUSED MYSELF WITH WRITING LETTERS
TO THE CHIEF PAPER OF THE TERRITORY THE VIRGINIA DAILY TERRITORIAL
ENTERPRISE AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURPRISED WHEN THEY APPEARED IN PRINT
MY GOOD OPINION OF THE EDITORS HAD STEADILY DECLINED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOMETHING BETTER TO FILL UP WITH THAN MY
LITERATURE
I HAD FOUND A LETTER IN THE POST OFFICE AS I CAME HOME FROM
THE HILL SIDE AND FINALLY I OPENED IT
EUREKA I NEVER DID KNOW WHAT
EUREKA MEANT BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AS PROPER A WORD TO HEAVE IN AS ANY WHEN
NO OTHER THAT SOUNDS PRETTY OFFERS IT WAS A DELIBERATE OFFER TO ME OF
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO COME UP TO VIRGINIA AND BE CITY EDITOR OF
THE ENTERPRISE
I WOULD HAVE CHALLENGED THE PUBLISHER IN THE BLIND LEAD DAYS I WANTED
TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP HIM NOW
TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK IT LOOKED
LIKE BLOATED LUXURY A FORTUNE A SINFUL AND LAVISH WASTE OF MONEY
BUT MY TRANSPORTS COOLED WHEN I THOUGHT OF MY INEXPERIENCE AND CONSEQUENT
UNFITNESS FOR THE POSITION AND STRAIGHTWAY ON TOP OF THIS MY LONG
ARRAY OF FAILURES ROSE UP BEFORE ME
YET IF I REFUSED THIS PLACE I MUST
PRESENTLY BECOME DEPENDENT UPON SOMEBODY FOR MY BREAD A THING
NECESSARILY DISTASTEFUL TO A MAN WHO HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A
HUMILIATION SINCE HE WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD
NOT MUCH TO BE PROUD OF
SINCE IT IS SO COMMON BUT THEN IT WAS ALL I HAD TO BE PROUD OF
SO I
WAS SCARED INTO BEING A CITY EDITOR
I WOULD HAVE DECLINED OTHERWISE
NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF TAKING CHANCES I DO NOT DOUBT THAT IF AT
THAT TIME I HAD BEEN OFFERED A SALARY TO TRANSLATE THE TALMUD FROM THE
ORIGINAL HEBREW I WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED ALBEIT WITH DIFFIDENCE AND SOME
MISGIVINGS AND THROWN AS MUCH VARIETY INTO IT AS I COULD FOR THE MONEY
I WENT UP TO VIRGINIA AND ENTERED UPON MY NEW VOCATION
I WAS A RUSTY
LOOKING CITY EDITOR I AM FREE TO CONFESS COATLESS SLOUCH HAT BLUE
WOOLEN SHIRT PANTALOONS STUFFED INTO BOOT TOPS WHISKERED HALF DOWN TO
THE WAIST AND THE UNIVERSAL NAVY REVOLVER SLUNG TO MY BELT
BUT I
SECURED A MORE CHRISTIAN COSTUME AND DISCARDED THE REVOLVER
I HAD NEVER HAD OCCASION TO KILL ANYBODY NOR EVER FELT A DESIRE TO DO
SO BUT HAD WORN THE THING IN DEFERENCE TO POPULAR SENTIMENT AND IN
ORDER THAT I MIGHT NOT BY ITS ABSENCE BE OFFENSIVELY CONSPICUOUS AND A
SUBJECT OF REMARK
BUT THE OTHER EDITORS AND ALL THE PRINTERS CARRIED
REVOLVERS
I ASKED THE CHIEF EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR MR
GOODMAN I WILL
CALL HIM SINCE IT DESCRIBES HIM AS WELL AS ANY NAME COULD DO FOR SOME
INSTRUCTIONS WITH REGARD TO MY DUTIES AND HE TOLD ME TO GO ALL OVER TOWN
AND ASK ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS MAKE NOTES OF THE
INFORMATION GAINED AND WRITE THEM OUT FOR PUBLICATION
AND HE ADDED
NEVER SAY 'WE LEARN' SO AND SO OR 'IT IS REPORTED OR 'IT IS RUMORED
OR 'WE UNDERSTAND' SO AND SO BUT GO TO HEADQUARTERS AND GET THE ABSOLUTE
FACTS AND THEN SPEAK OUT AND SAY 'IT IS SO AND SO OTHERWISE PEOPLE
WILL NOT PUT CONFIDENCE IN YOUR NEWS
UNASSAILABLE CERTAINLY IS THE
THING THAT GIVES A NEWSPAPER THE FIRMEST AND MOST VALUABLE REPUTATION
IT WAS THE WHOLE THING IN A NUT SHELL AND TO THIS DAY WHEN I FIND A
REPORTER COMMENCING HIS ARTICLE WITH WE UNDERSTAND I GATHER A
SUSPICION THAT HE HAS NOT TAKEN AS MUCH PAINS TO INFORM HIMSELF AS HE
OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
I MORALIZE WELL BUT I DID NOT ALWAYS PRACTISE WELL
WHEN I WAS A CITY EDITOR I LET FANCY GET THE UPPER HAND OF FACT TOO
OFTEN WHEN THERE WAS A DEARTH OF NEWS
I CAN NEVER FORGET MY FIRST DAY'S
EXPERIENCE AS A REPORTER
I WANDERED ABOUT TOWN QUESTIONING EVERYBODY
BORING EVERYBODY AND FINDING OUT THAT NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING
AT THE END
OF FIVE HOURS MY NOTEBOOK WAS STILL BARREN
I SPOKE TO MR
GOODMAN
HE
SAID
DAN USED TO MAKE A GOOD THING OUT OF THE HAY WAGONS IN A DRY TIME WHEN
THERE WERE NO FIRES OR INQUESTS
ARE THERE NO HAY WAGONS IN FROM THE
TRUCKEE IF THERE ARE YOU MIGHT SPEAK OF THE RENEWED ACTIVITY AND ALL
THAT SORT OF THING IN THE HAY BUSINESS YOU KNOW
IT ISN'T SENSATIONAL OR EXCITING BUT IT FILLS UP AND LOOKS BUSINESS
LIKE
I CANVASSED THE CITY AGAIN AND FOUND ONE WRETCHED OLD HAY TRUCK DRAGGING
IN FROM THE COUNTRY
BUT I MADE AFFLUENT USE OF IT
I MULTIPLIED IT BY
SIXTEEN BROUGHT IT INTO TOWN FROM SIXTEEN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS MADE
SIXTEEN SEPARATE ITEMS OUT OF IT AND GOT UP SUCH ANOTHER SWEAT ABOUT HAY
AS VIRGINIA CITY HAD NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD BEFORE
THIS WAS ENCOURAGING
TWO NONPAREIL COLUMNS HAD TO BE FILLED AND I WAS
GETTING ALONG
PRESENTLY WHEN THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK DISMAL AGAIN A
DESPERADO KILLED A MAN IN A SALOON AND JOY RETURNED ONCE MORE
I NEVER
WAS SO GLAD OVER ANY MERE TRIFLE BEFORE IN MY LIFE
I SAID TO THE
MURDERER
SIR YOU ARE A STRANGER TO ME BUT YOU HAVE DONE ME A KINDNESS THIS DAY
WHICH I CAN NEVER FORGET
IF WHOLE YEARS OF GRATITUDE CAN BE TO YOU ANY
SLIGHT COMPENSATION THEY SHALL BE YOURS
I WAS IN TROUBLE AND YOU HAVE
RELIEVED ME NOBLY AND AT A TIME WHEN ALL SEEMED DARK AND DREAR
COUNT ME
YOUR FRIEND FROM THIS TIME FORTH FOR I AM NOT A MAN TO FORGET A FAVOR
IF I DID NOT REALLY SAY THAT TO HIM I AT LEAST FELT A SORT OF ITCHING
DESIRE TO DO IT
I WROTE UP THE MURDER WITH A HUNGRY ATTENTION TO
DETAILS AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED EXPERIENCED BUT ONE REGRET NAMELY
THAT THEY HAD NOT HANGED MY BENEFACTOR ON THE SPOT SO THAT I COULD WORK
HIM UP TOO
NEXT I DISCOVERED SOME EMIGRANT WAGONS GOING INTO CAMP ON THE PLAZA AND
FOUND THAT THEY HAD LATELY COME THROUGH THE HOSTILE INDIAN COUNTRY AND
HAD FARED RATHER ROUGHLY
I MADE THE BEST OF THE ITEM THAT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED AND FELT THAT IF I WERE NOT CONFINED WITHIN
RIGID LIMITS BY THE PRESENCE OF THE REPORTERS OF THE OTHER PAPERS I COULD
ADD PARTICULARS THAT WOULD MAKE THE ARTICLE MUCH MORE INTERESTING
HOWEVER I FOUND ONE WAGON THAT WAS GOING ON TO CALIFORNIA AND MADE SOME
JUDICIOUS INQUIRIES OF THE PROPRIETOR
WHEN I LEARNED THROUGH HIS SHORT
AND SURLY ANSWERS TO MY CROSS QUESTIONING THAT HE WAS CERTAINLY GOING ON
AND WOULD NOT BE IN THE CITY NEXT DAY TO MAKE TROUBLE I GOT AHEAD OF THE
OTHER PAPERS FOR I TOOK DOWN HIS LIST OF NAMES AND ADDED HIS PARTY TO
THE KILLED AND WOUNDED
HAVING MORE SCOPE HERE I PUT THIS WAGON THROUGH
AN INDIAN FIGHT THAT TO THIS DAY HAS NO PARALLEL IN HISTORY
MY TWO COLUMNS WERE FILLED
WHEN I READ THEM OVER IN THE MORNING I FELT
THAT I HAD FOUND MY LEGITIMATE OCCUPATION AT LAST
I REASONED WITHIN
MYSELF THAT NEWS AND STIRRING NEWS TOO WAS WHAT A PAPER NEEDED AND I
FELT THAT I WAS PECULIARLY ENDOWED WITH THE ABILITY TO FURNISH IT
MR
GOODMAN SAID THAT I WAS AS GOOD A REPORTER AS DAN
I DESIRED NO
HIGHER COMMENDATION
WITH ENCOURAGEMENT LIKE THAT I FELT THAT I COULD
TAKE MY PEN AND MURDER ALL THE IMMIGRANTS ON THE PLAINS IF NEED BE AND
THE INTERESTS OF THE PAPER DEMANDED IT
CHAPTER XLIII
HOWEVER AS I GREW BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE BUSINESS AND LEARNED THE
RUN OF THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION I CEASED TO REQUIRE THE AID OF FANCY TO
ANY LARGE EXTENT AND BECAME ABLE TO FILL MY COLUMNS WITHOUT DIVERGING
NOTICEABLY FROM THE DOMAIN OF FACT
I STRUCK UP FRIENDSHIPS WITH THE REPORTERS OF THE OTHER JOURNALS AND WE
SWAPPED REGULARS WITH EACH OTHER AND THUS ECONOMIZED WORK
REGULARS
ARE PERMANENT SOURCES OF NEWS LIKE COURTS BULLION RETURNS CLEAN UPS
AT THE QUARTZ MILLS AND INQUESTS
INASMUCH AS EVERYBODY WENT ARMED WE
HAD AN INQUEST ABOUT EVERY DAY AND SO THIS DEPARTMENT WAS NATURALLY SET
DOWN AMONG THE REGULARS WE HAD LIVELY PAPERS IN THOSE DAYS
MY GREAT
COMPETITOR AMONG THE REPORTERS WAS BOGGS OF THE UNION
HE WAS AN
EXCELLENT REPORTER
ONCE IN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS HE WOULD GET A LITTLE
INTOXICATED BUT AS A GENERAL THING HE WAS A WARY AND CAUTIOUS DRINKER
ALTHOUGH ALWAYS READY TO TAMPER A LITTLE WITH THE ENEMY
HE HAD THE
ADVANTAGE OF ME IN ONE THING HE COULD GET THE MONTHLY PUBLIC SCHOOL
REPORT AND I COULD NOT BECAUSE THE PRINCIPAL HATED THE ENTERPRISE
ONE SNOWY NIGHT WHEN THE REPORT WAS DUE I STARTED OUT SADLY WONDERING
HOW I WAS GOING TO GET IT
PRESENTLY A FEW STEPS UP THE ALMOST DESERTED
STREET I STUMBLED ON BOGGS AND ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS GOING
AFTER THE SCHOOL REPORT
I'LL GO ALONG WITH YOU
NO SIR
I'LL EXCUSE YOU
JUST AS YOU SAY
A SALOON KEEPER'S BOY PASSED BY WITH A STEAMING PITCHER OF HOT PUNCH AND
BOGGS SNUFFED THE FRAGRANCE GRATEFULLY
HE GAZED FONDLY AFTER THE BOY
AND SAW HIM START UP THE ENTERPRISE STAIRS
I SAID
I WISH YOU COULD HELP ME GET THAT SCHOOL BUSINESS BUT SINCE YOU CAN'T
I MUST RUN UP TO THE UNION OFFICE AND SEE IF I CAN GET THEM TO LET ME
HAVE A PROOF OF IT AFTER THEY HAVE SET IT UP THOUGH I DON'T BEGIN TO
SUPPOSE THEY WILL
GOOD NIGHT
HOLD ON A MINUTE
I DON'T MIND GETTING THE REPORT AND SITTING AROUND
WITH THE BOYS A LITTLE WHILE YOU COPY IT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DROP DOWN
TO THE PRINCIPAL'S WITH ME
NOW YOU TALK LIKE A RATIONAL BEING
COME ALONG
WE PLOWED A COUPLE OF BLOCKS THROUGH THE SNOW GOT THE REPORT AND
RETURNED TO OUR OFFICE
IT WAS A SHORT DOCUMENT AND SOON COPIED
MEANTIME BOGGS HELPED HIMSELF TO THE PUNCH
I GAVE THE MANUSCRIPT BACK
TO HIM AND WE STARTED OUT TO GET AN INQUEST FOR WE HEARD PISTOL SHOTS
NEAR BY
WE GOT THE PARTICULARS WITH LITTLE LOSS OF TIME FOR IT WAS
ONLY AN INFERIOR SORT OF BAR ROOM MURDER AND OF LITTLE INTEREST TO THE
PUBLIC AND THEN WE SEPARATED
AWAY AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
WHEN WE HAD GONE TO PRESS AND WERE HAVING A RELAXING CONCERT AS USUAL
FOR SOME OF THE PRINTERS WERE GOOD SINGERS AND OTHERS GOOD PERFORMERS ON
THE GUITAR AND ON THAT ATROCITY THE ACCORDION THE PROPRIETOR OF THE
UNION STRODE IN AND DESIRED TO KNOW IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD ANYTHING OF
BOGGS OR THE SCHOOL REPORT
WE STATED THE CASE AND ALL TURNED OUT TO
HELP HUNT FOR THE DELINQUENT
WE FOUND HIM STANDING ON A TABLE IN A
SALOON WITH AN OLD TIN LANTERN IN ONE HAND AND THE SCHOOL REPORT IN THE
OTHER HARANGUING A GANG OF INTOXICATED CORNISH MINERS ON THE INIQUITY OF
SQUANDERING THE PUBLIC MONEYS ON EDUCATION WHEN HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
HONEST HARD WORKING MEN ARE LITERALLY STARVING FOR WHISKEY RIOTOUS
APPLAUSE HE HAD BEEN ASSISTING IN A REGAL SPREE WITH THOSE PARTIES FOR
HOURS
WE DRAGGED HIM AWAY AND PUT HIM TO BED
OF COURSE THERE WAS NO SCHOOL REPORT IN THE UNION AND BOGGS HELD ME
ACCOUNTABLE THOUGH I WAS INNOCENT OF ANY INTENTION OR DESIRE TO COMPASS
ITS ABSENCE FROM THAT PAPER AND WAS AS SORRY AS ANY ONE THAT THE
MISFORTUNE HAD OCCURRED
BUT WE WERE PERFECTLY FRIENDLY
THE DAY THAT THE SCHOOL REPORT WAS NEXT
DUE THE PROPRIETOR OF THE GENESSEE MINE FURNISHED US A BUGGY AND ASKED
US TO GO DOWN AND WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROPERTY A VERY COMMON
REQUEST AND ONE ALWAYS GLADLY ACCEDED TO WHEN PEOPLE FURNISHED BUGGIES
FOR WE WERE AS FOND OF PLEASURE EXCURSIONS AS OTHER PEOPLE
IN DUE TIME
WE ARRIVED AT THE MINE NOTHING BUT A HOLE IN THE GROUND NINETY FEET
DEEP AND NO WAY OF GETTING DOWN INTO IT BUT BY HOLDING ON TO A ROPE AND
BEING LOWERED WITH A WINDLASS
THE WORKMEN HAD JUST GONE OFF SOMEWHERE
TO DINNER
I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO LOWER BOGGS'S BULK SO I TOOK AN
UNLIGHTED CANDLE IN MY TEETH MADE A LOOP FOR MY FOOT IN THE END OF THE
ROPE IMPLORED BOGGS NOT TO GO TO SLEEP OR LET THE WINDLASS GET THE START
OF HIM AND THEN SWUNG OUT OVER THE SHAFT
I REACHED THE BOTTOM MUDDY
AND BRUISED ABOUT THE ELBOWS BUT SAFE
I LIT THE CANDLE MADE AN
EXAMINATION OF THE ROCK SELECTED SOME SPECIMENS AND SHOUTED TO BOGGS TO
HOIST AWAY
NO ANSWER
PRESENTLY A HEAD APPEARED IN THE CIRCLE OF
DAYLIGHT AWAY ALOFT AND A VOICE CAME DOWN
ARE YOU ALL SET
ALL SET HOIST AWAY
ARE YOU COMFORTABLE
PERFECTLY
COULD YOU WAIT A LITTLE
OH CERTAINLY NO PARTICULAR HURRY
WELL GOOD BY
WHY WHERE ARE YOU GOING
AFTER THE SCHOOL REPORT
AND HE DID
I STAID DOWN THERE AN HOUR AND SURPRISED THE WORKMEN WHEN
THEY HAULED UP AND FOUND A MAN ON THE ROPE INSTEAD OF A BUCKET OF ROCK
I WALKED HOME TOO FIVE MILES UP HILL
WE HAD NO SCHOOL REPORT NEXT
MORNING BUT THE UNION HAD
SIX MONTHS AFTER MY ENTRY INTO JOURNALISM THE GRAND FLUSH TIMES OF
SILVERLAND BEGAN AND THEY CONTINUED WITH UNABATED SPLENDOR FOR THREE
YEARS
ALL DIFFICULTY ABOUT FILLING UP THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT CEASED
AND THE ONLY TROUBLE NOW WAS HOW TO MAKE THE LENGTHENED COLUMNS HOLD THE
WORLD OF INCIDENTS AND HAPPENINGS THAT CAME TO OUR LITERARY NET EVERY
DAY
VIRGINIA HAD GROWN TO BE THE LIVEST TOWN FOR ITS AGE AND
POPULATION THAT AMERICA HAD EVER PRODUCED
THE SIDEWALKS SWARMED WITH
PEOPLE TO SUCH AN EXTENT INDEED THAT IT WAS GENERALLY NO EASY MATTER
TO STEM THE HUMAN TIDE
THE STREETS THEMSELVES WERE JUST AS CROWDED WITH
QUARTZ WAGONS FREIGHT TEAMS AND OTHER VEHICLES
THE PROCESSION WAS
ENDLESS
SO GREAT WAS THE PACK THAT BUGGIES FREQUENTLY HAD TO WAIT HALF
AN HOUR FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO CROSS THE PRINCIPAL STREET
JOY SAT ON
EVERY COUNTENANCE AND THERE WAS A GLAD ALMOST FIERCE INTENSITY IN
EVERY EYE THAT TOLD OF THE MONEY GETTING SCHEMES THAT WERE SEETHING IN
EVERY BRAIN AND THE HIGH HOPE THAT HELD SWAY IN EVERY HEART
MONEY WAS
AS PLENTY AS DUST EVERY INDIVIDUAL CONSIDERED HIMSELF WEALTHY AND A
MELANCHOLY COUNTENANCE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
THERE WERE MILITARY
COMPANIES FIRE COMPANIES BRASS BANDS BANKS HOTELS THEATRES
HURDY GURDY HOUSES WIDE OPEN GAMBLING PALACES POLITICAL POW WOWS
CIVIC PROCESSIONS STREET FIGHTS MURDERS INQUESTS RIOTS A WHISKEY
MILL EVERY FIFTEEN STEPS A BOARD OF ALDERMEN A MAYOR A CITY SURVEYOR
A CITY ENGINEER A CHIEF OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH FIRST SECOND AND
THIRD ASSISTANTS A CHIEF OF POLICE CITY MARSHAL AND A LARGE POLICE
FORCE TWO BOARDS OF MINING BROKERS A DOZEN BREWERIES AND HALF A DOZEN
JAILS AND STATION HOUSES IN FULL OPERATION AND SOME TALK OF BUILDING A
CHURCH
THE FLUSH TIMES WERE IN MAGNIFICENT FLOWER LARGE FIRE PROOF
BRICK BUILDINGS WERE GOING UP IN THE PRINCIPAL STREETS AND THE WOODEN
SUBURBS WERE SPREADING OUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
TOWN LOTS SOARED UP TO
PRICES THAT WERE AMAZING
THE GREAT COMSTOCK LODE STRETCHED ITS OPULENT LENGTH STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE TOWN FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND EVERY MINE ON IT WAS IN DILIGENT
PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT
ONE OF THESE MINES ALONE EMPLOYED SIX HUNDRED
AND SEVENTY FIVE MEN AND IN THE MATTER OF ELECTIONS THE ADAGE WAS AS
THE 'GOULD AND CURRY' GOES SO GOES THE CITY LABORING MEN'S WAGES WERE
FOUR AND SIX DOLLARS A DAY AND THEY WORKED IN THREE SHIFTS OR GANGS
AND THE BLASTING AND PICKING AND SHOVELING WENT ON WITHOUT CEASING NIGHT
AND DAY
THE CITY OF VIRGINIA ROOSTED ROYALLY MIDWAY UP THE STEEP SIDE OF MOUNT
DAVIDSON SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND
IN THE CLEAR NEVADA ATMOSPHERE WAS VISIBLE FROM A DISTANCE OF FIFTY
MILES IT CLAIMED A POPULATION OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND
AND ALL DAY LONG HALF OF THIS LITTLE ARMY SWARMED THE STREETS LIKE BEES
AND THE OTHER HALF SWARMED AMONG THE DRIFTS AND TUNNELS OF THE
COMSTOCK HUNDREDS OF FEET DOWN IN THE EARTH DIRECTLY UNDER THOSE SAME
STREETS
OFTEN WE FELT OUR CHAIRS JAR AND HEARD THE FAINT BOOM OF A
BLAST DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH UNDER THE OFFICE
THE MOUNTAIN SIDE WAS SO STEEP THAT THE ENTIRE TOWN HAD A SLANT TO IT
LIKE A ROOF
EACH STREET WAS A TERRACE AND FROM EACH TO THE NEXT STREET
BELOW THE DESCENT WAS FORTY OR FIFTY FEET
THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES WERE
LEVEL WITH THE STREET THEY FACED BUT THEIR REAR FIRST FLOORS WERE
PROPPED ON LOFTY STILTS A MAN COULD STAND AT A REAR FIRST FLOOR WINDOW
OF A C STREET HOUSE AND LOOK DOWN THE CHIMNEYS OF THE ROW OF HOUSES BELOW
HIM FACING D STREET
IT WAS A LABORIOUS CLIMB IN THAT THIN ATMOSPHERE
TO ASCEND FROM D TO A STREET AND YOU WERE PANTING AND OUT OF BREATH WHEN
YOU GOT THERE BUT YOU COULD TURN AROUND AND GO DOWN AGAIN LIKE A HOUSE
A FIRE SO TO SPEAK
THE ATMOSPHERE WAS SO RARIFIED ON ACCOUNT OF THE
GREAT ALTITUDE THAT ONE'S BLOOD LAY NEAR THE SURFACE ALWAYS AND THE
SCRATCH OF A PIN WAS A DISASTER WORTH WORRYING ABOUT FOR THE CHANCES
WERE THAT A GRIEVOUS ERYSIPELAS WOULD ENSUE
BUT TO OFFSET THIS THE
THIN ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO CARRY HEALING TO GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND THEREFORE
TO SIMPLY SHOOT YOUR ADVERSARY THROUGH BOTH LUNGS WAS A THING NOT LIKELY
TO AFFORD YOU ANY PERMANENT SATISFACTION FOR HE WOULD BE NEARLY CERTAIN
TO BE AROUND LOOKING FOR YOU WITHIN THE MONTH AND NOT WITH AN OPERA
GLASS EITHER
FROM VIRGINIA'S AIRY SITUATION ONE COULD LOOK OVER A VAST FAR REACHING
PANORAMA OF MOUNTAIN RANGES AND DESERTS AND WHETHER THE DAY WAS BRIGHT
OR OVERCAST WHETHER THE SUN WAS RISING OR SETTING OR FLAMING IN THE
ZENITH OR WHETHER NIGHT AND THE MOON HELD SWAY THE SPECTACLE WAS ALWAYS
IMPRESSIVE AND BEAUTIFUL
OVER YOUR HEAD MOUNT DAVIDSON LIFTED ITS GRAY
DOME AND BEFORE AND BELOW YOU A RUGGED CANYON CLOVE THE BATTLEMENTED
HILLS MAKING A SOMBRE GATEWAY THROUGH WHICH A SOFT TINTED DESERT WAS
GLIMPSED WITH THE SILVER THREAD OF A RIVER WINDING THROUGH IT BORDERED
WITH TREES WHICH MANY MILES OF DISTANCE DIMINISHED TO A DELICATE FRINGE
AND STILL FURTHER AWAY THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS ROSE UP AND STRETCHED THEIR
LONG BARRIER TO THE FILMY HORIZON FAR ENOUGH BEYOND A LAKE THAT BURNED
IN THE DESERT LIKE A FALLEN SUN THOUGH THAT ITSELF LAY FIFTY MILES
REMOVED
LOOK FROM YOUR WINDOW WHERE YOU WOULD THERE WAS FASCINATION IN
THE PICTURE
AT RARE INTERVALS BUT VERY RARE THERE WERE CLOUDS IN OUR
SKIES AND THEN THE SETTING SUN WOULD GILD AND FLUSH AND GLORIFY THIS
MIGHTY EXPANSE OF SCENERY WITH A BEWILDERING POMP OF COLOR THAT HELD THE
EYE LIKE A SPELL AND MOVED THE SPIRIT LIKE MUSIC
CHAPTER XLIV
MY SALARY WAS INCREASED TO FORTY DOLLARS A WEEK
BUT I SELDOM DREW IT
I HAD PLENTY OF OTHER RESOURCES AND WHAT WERE TWO BROAD TWENTY DOLLAR
GOLD PIECES TO A MAN WHO HAD HIS POCKETS FULL OF SUCH AND A CUMBERSOME
ABUNDANCE OF BRIGHT HALF DOLLARS BESIDES PAPER MONEY HAS NEVER COME
INTO USE ON THE PACIFIC COAST REPORTING WAS LUCRATIVE AND EVERY MAN
IN THE TOWN WAS LAVISH WITH HIS MONEY AND HIS FEET THE CITY AND ALL
THE GREAT MOUNTAIN SIDE WERE RIDDLED WITH MINING SHAFTS
THERE WERE MORE
MINES THAN MINERS
TRUE NOT TEN OF THESE MINES WERE YIELDING ROCK WORTH
HAULING TO A MILL BUT EVERYBODY SAID WAIT TILL THE SHAFT GETS DOWN
WHERE THE LEDGE COMES IN SOLID AND THEN YOU WILL SEE SO NOBODY WAS
DISCOURAGED
THESE WERE NEARLY ALL WILD CAT MINES AND WHOLLY
WORTHLESS BUT NOBODY BELIEVED IT THEN
THE OPHIR THE GOULD
CURRY THE MEXICAN AND OTHER GREAT MINES ON THE COMSTOCK LEAD IN
VIRGINIA AND GOLD HILL WERE TURNING OUT HUGE PILES OF RICH ROCK EVERY
DAY AND EVERY MAN BELIEVED THAT HIS LITTLE WILD CAT CLAIM WAS AS GOOD AS
ANY ON THE MAIN LEAD AND WOULD INFALLIBLY BE WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS A
FOOT WHEN HE GOT DOWN WHERE IT CAME IN SOLID POOR FELLOW HE WAS
BLESSEDLY BLIND TO THE FACT THAT HE NEVER WOULD SEE THAT DAY
SO THE
THOUSAND WILD CAT SHAFTS BURROWED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE EARTH DAY BY
DAY AND ALL MEN WERE BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH HOPE AND HAPPINESS
HOW
THEY LABORED PROPHESIED EXULTED SURELY NOTHING LIKE IT WAS EVER SEEN
BEFORE SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN
EVERY ONE OF THESE WILD CAT MINES NOT
MINES BUT HOLES IN THE GROUND OVER IMAGINARY MINES WAS INCORPORATED AND
HAD HANDSOMELY ENGRAVED STOCK AND THE STOCK WAS SALABLE TOO
IT WAS
BOUGHT AND SOLD WITH A FEVERISH AVIDITY IN THE BOARDS EVERY DAY
YOU
COULD GO UP ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE SCRATCH AROUND AND FIND A LEDGE THERE
WAS NO LACK OF THEM PUT UP A NOTICE WITH A GRANDILOQUENT NAME IN IT
START A SHAFT GET YOUR STOCK PRINTED AND WITH NOTHING WHATEVER TO PROVE
THAT YOUR MINE WAS WORTH A STRAW YOU COULD PUT YOUR STOCK ON THE MARKET
AND SELL OUT FOR HUNDREDS AND EVEN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO MAKE MONEY
AND MAKE IT FAST WAS AS EASY AS IT WAS TO EAT YOUR DINNER
EVERY MAN OWNED FEET IN FIFTY DIFFERENT WILD CAT MINES AND CONSIDERED
HIS FORTUNE MADE
THINK OF A CITY WITH NOT ONE SOLITARY POOR MAN IN IT
ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT WHEN MONTH AFTER MONTH WENT BY AND STILL NOT A
WILD CAT MINE BY WILD CAT I MEAN IN GENERAL TERMS ANY CLAIM NOT
LOCATED ON THE MOTHER VEIN I E THE COMSTOCK YIELDED A TON OF ROCK
WORTH CRUSHING THE PEOPLE WOULD BEGIN TO WONDER IF THEY WERE NOT PUTTING
TOO MUCH FAITH IN THEIR PROSPECTIVE RICHES BUT THERE WAS NOT A THOUGHT
OF SUCH A THING
THEY BURROWED AWAY BOUGHT AND SOLD AND WERE HAPPY
NEW CLAIMS WERE TAKEN UP DAILY AND IT WAS THE FRIENDLY CUSTOM TO RUN
STRAIGHT TO THE NEWSPAPER OFFICES GIVE THE REPORTER FORTY OR FIFTY
FEET AND GET THEM TO GO AND EXAMINE THE MINE AND PUBLISH A NOTICE OF
IT
THEY DID NOT CARE A FIG WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE PROPERTY SO YOU SAID
SOMETHING
CONSEQUENTLY WE GENERALLY SAID A WORD OR TWO TO THE EFFECT
THAT THE INDICATIONS WERE GOOD OR THAT THE LEDGE WAS SIX FEET WIDE
OR THAT THE ROCK RESEMBLED THE COMSTOCK AND SO IT DID BUT AS A
GENERAL THING THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT STARTLING ENOUGH TO KNOCK YOU
DOWN
IF THE ROCK WAS MODERATELY PROMISING WE FOLLOWED THE CUSTOM OF
THE COUNTRY USED STRONG ADJECTIVES AND FROTHED AT THE MOUTH AS IF A VERY
MARVEL IN SILVER DISCOVERIES HAD TRANSPIRED
IF THE MINE WAS A
DEVELOPED ONE AND HAD NO PAY ORE TO SHOW AND OF COURSE IT HADN'T WE
PRAISED THE TUNNEL SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFATUATING TUNNELS IN
THE LAND DRIVELED AND DRIVELED ABOUT THE TUNNEL TILL WE RAN ENTIRELY OUT
OF ECSTASIES BUT NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT THE ROCK
WE WOULD SQUANDER
HALF A COLUMN OF ADULATION ON A SHAFT OR A NEW WIRE ROPE OR A DRESSED
PINE WINDLASS OR A FASCINATING FORCE PUMP AND CLOSE WITH A BURST OF
ADMIRATION OF THE GENTLEMANLY AND EFFICIENT SUPERINTENDENT OF THE MINE
BUT NEVER UTTER A WHISPER ABOUT THE ROCK
AND THOSE PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS
PLEASED ALWAYS SATISFIED
OCCASIONALLY WE PATCHED UP AND VARNISHED OUR
REPUTATION FOR DISCRIMINATION AND STERN UNDEVIATING ACCURACY BY GIVING
SOME OLD ABANDONED CLAIM A BLAST THAT OUGHT TO HAVE MADE ITS DRY BONES
RATTLE AND THEN SOMEBODY WOULD SEIZE IT AND SELL IT ON THE FLEETING
NOTORIETY THUS CONFERRED UPON IT
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE SHAPE OF A MINING CLAIM THAT WAS NOT SALABLE
WE RECEIVED PRESENTS OF FEET EVERY DAY
IF WE NEEDED A HUNDRED DOLLARS
OR SO WE SOLD SOME IF NOT WE HOARDED IT AWAY SATISFIED THAT IT WOULD
ULTIMATELY BE WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS A FOOT
I HAD A TRUNK ABOUT HALF
FULL OF STOCK WHEN A CLAIM MADE A STIR IN THE MARKET AND WENT UP TO A
HIGH FIGURE I SEARCHED THROUGH MY PILE TO SEE IF I HAD ANY OF ITS STOCK
AND GENERALLY FOUND IT
THE PRICES ROSE AND FELL CONSTANTLY BUT STILL A FALL DISTURBED US
LITTLE BECAUSE A THOUSAND DOLLARS A FOOT WAS OUR FIGURE AND SO WE WERE
CONTENT TO LET IT FLUCTUATE AS MUCH AS IT PLEASED TILL IT REACHED IT
MY PILE OF STOCK WAS NOT ALL GIVEN TO ME BY PEOPLE WHO WISHED THEIR
CLAIMS NOTICED AT LEAST HALF OF IT WAS GIVEN ME BY PERSONS WHO HAD NO
THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AND LOOKED FOR NOTHING MORE THAN A SIMPLE VERBAL
THANK YOU AND YOU WERE NOT EVEN OBLIGED BY LAW TO FURNISH THAT
IF YOU ARE COMING UP THE STREET WITH A COUPLE OF BASKETS OF APPLES IN
YOUR HANDS AND YOU MEET A FRIEND YOU NATURALLY INVITE HIM TO TAKE A
FEW
THAT DESCRIBES THE CONDITION OF THINGS IN VIRGINIA IN THE FLUSH
TIMES EVERY MAN HAD HIS POCKETS FULL OF STOCK AND IT WAS THE ACTUAL
CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY TO PART WITH SMALL QUANTITIES OF IT TO FRIENDS
WITHOUT THE ASKING
VERY OFTEN IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO CLOSE THE TRANSACTION INSTANTLY WHEN A
MAN OFFERED A STOCK PRESENT TO A FRIEND FOR THE OFFER WAS ONLY GOOD AND
BINDING AT THAT MOMENT AND IF THE PRICE WENT TO A HIGH FIGURE SHORTLY
AFTERWARD THE PROCRASTINATION WAS A THING TO BE REGRETTED
MR
STEWART
SENATOR NOW FROM NEVADA ONE DAY TOLD ME HE WOULD GIVE ME TWENTY FEET
OF JUSTIS STOCK IF I WOULD WALK OVER TO HIS OFFICE
IT WAS WORTH FIVE
OR TEN DOLLARS A FOOT
I ASKED HIM TO MAKE THE OFFER GOOD FOR NEXT DAY
AS I WAS JUST GOING TO DINNER
HE SAID HE WOULD NOT BE IN TOWN SO I
RISKED IT AND TOOK MY DINNER INSTEAD OF THE STOCK
WITHIN THE WEEK THE
PRICE WENT UP TO SEVENTY DOLLARS AND AFTERWARD TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
BUT NOTHING COULD MAKE THAT MAN YIELD
I SUPPOSE HE SOLD THAT STOCK OF
MINE AND PLACED THE GUILTY PROCEEDS IN HIS OWN POCKET
MY REVENGE WILL
BE FOUND IN THE ACCOMPANYING PORTRAIT I MET THREE FRIENDS ONE
AFTERNOON WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN BUYING OVERMAN STOCK AT AUCTION AT
EIGHT DOLLARS A FOOT
ONE SAID IF I WOULD COME UP TO HIS OFFICE HE WOULD
GIVE ME FIFTEEN FEET ANOTHER SAID HE WOULD ADD FIFTEEN THE THIRD SAID
HE WOULD DO THE SAME
BUT I WAS GOING AFTER AN INQUEST AND COULD NOT
STOP
A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARD THEY SOLD ALL THEIR OVERMAN AT SIX HUNDRED
DOLLARS A FOOT AND GENEROUSLY CAME AROUND TO TELL ME ABOUT IT AND ALSO
TO URGE ME TO ACCEPT OF THE NEXT FORTY FIVE FEET OF IT THAT PEOPLE TRIED
TO FORCE ON ME
THESE ARE ACTUAL FACTS AND I COULD MAKE THE LIST A LONG ONE AND STILL
CONFINE MYSELF STRICTLY TO THE TRUTH
MANY A TIME FRIENDS GAVE US AS
MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE FEET OF STOCK THAT WAS SELLING AT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS
A FOOT AND THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF IT THAN THEY WOULD OF OFFERING A
GUEST A CIGAR
THESE WERE FLUSH TIMES INDEED I THOUGHT THEY WERE
GOING TO LAST ALWAYS BUT SOMEHOW I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A PROPHET
TO SHOW WHAT A WILD SPIRIT POSSESSED THE MINING BRAIN OF THE COMMUNITY
I WILL REMARK THAT CLAIMS WERE ACTUALLY LOCATED IN EXCAVATIONS FOR
CELLARS WHERE THE PICK HAD EXPOSED WHAT SEEMED TO BE QUARTZ VEINS AND
NOT CELLARS IN THE SUBURBS EITHER BUT IN THE VERY HEART OF THE CITY
AND FORTHWITH STOCK WOULD BE ISSUED AND THROWN ON THE MARKET
IT WAS
SMALL MATTER WHO THE CELLAR BELONGED TO THE LEDGE BELONGED TO THE
FINDER AND UNLESS THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT INTERFERED INASMUCH AS
THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE PRIMARY RIGHT TO MINES OF THE NOBLE METALS IN
NEVADA OR AT LEAST DID THEN IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE HIS PRIVILEGE TO
WORK IT
IMAGINE A STRANGER STAKING OUT A MINING CLAIM AMONG THE COSTLY
SHRUBBERY IN YOUR FRONT YARD AND CALMLY PROCEEDING TO LAY WASTE THE
GROUND WITH PICK AND SHOVEL AND BLASTING POWDER IT HAS BEEN OFTEN DONE
IN CALIFORNIA
IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL BUSINESS STREETS OF
VIRGINIA A MAN LOCATED A MINING CLAIM AND BEGAN A SHAFT ON IT
HE
GAVE ME A HUNDRED FEET OF THE STOCK AND I SOLD IT FOR A FINE SUIT OF
CLOTHES BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD FALL DOWN THE SHAFT AND SUE
FOR DAMAGES
I OWNED IN ANOTHER CLAIM THAT WAS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF
ANOTHER STREET AND TO SHOW HOW ABSURD PEOPLE CAN BE THAT EAST INDIA
STOCK AS IT WAS CALLED SOLD BRISKLY ALTHOUGH THERE WAS AN ANCIENT
TUNNEL RUNNING DIRECTLY UNDER THE CLAIM AND ANY MAN COULD GO INTO IT AND
SEE THAT IT DID NOT CUT A QUARTZ LEDGE OR ANYTHING THAT REMOTELY
RESEMBLED ONE
ONE PLAN OF ACQUIRING SUDDEN WEALTH WAS TO SALT A WILD CAT CLAIM AND
SELL OUT WHILE THE EXCITEMENT WAS UP
THE PROCESS WAS SIMPLE
THE SCHEMER LOCATED A WORTHLESS LEDGE SUNK A SHAFT ON IT BOUGHT A WAGON
LOAD OF RICH COMSTOCK ORE DUMPED A PORTION OF IT INTO THE SHAFT AND
PILED THE REST BY ITS SIDE ABOVE GROUND
THEN HE SHOWED THE PROPERTY TO
A SIMPLETON AND SOLD IT TO HIM AT A HIGH FIGURE
OF COURSE THE WAGON
LOAD OF RICH ORE WAS ALL THAT THE VICTIM EVER GOT OUT OF HIS PURCHASE
A MOST REMARKABLE CASE OF SALTING WAS THAT OF THE NORTH OPHIR
IT WAS CLAIMED THAT THIS VEIN WAS A REMOTE EXTENSION OF THE ORIGINAL
OPHIR A VALUABLE MINE ON THE COMSTOCK FOR A FEW DAYS EVERYBODY WAS
TALKING ABOUT THE RICH DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTH OPHIR
IT WAS SAID THAT
IT YIELDED PERFECTLY PURE SILVER IN SMALL SOLID LUMPS
I WENT TO THE
PLACE WITH THE OWNERS AND FOUND A SHAFT SIX OR EIGHT FEET DEEP IN THE
BOTTOM OF WHICH WAS A BADLY SHATTERED VEIN OF DULL YELLOWISH
UNPROMISING ROCK
ONE WOULD AS SOON EXPECT TO FIND SILVER IN A
GRINDSTONE
WE GOT OUT A PAN OF THE RUBBISH AND WASHED IT IN A PUDDLE
AND SURE ENOUGH AMONG THE SEDIMENT WE FOUND HALF A DOZEN BLACK
BULLET LOOKING PELLETS OF UNIMPEACHABLE NATIVE SILVER
NOBODY HAD EVER
HEARD OF SUCH A THING BEFORE SCIENCE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR SUCH A QUEER
NOVELTY
THE STOCK ROSE TO SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A FOOT AND AT THIS FIGURE
THE WORLD RENOWNED TRAGEDIAN MCKEAN BUCHANAN BOUGHT A COMMANDING
INTEREST AND PREPARED TO QUIT THE STAGE ONCE MORE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING
THAT
AND THEN IT TRANSPIRED THAT THE MINE HAD BEEN SALTED AND NOT IN
ANY HACKNEYED WAY EITHER BUT IN A SINGULARLY BOLD BAREFACED AND
PECULIARLY ORIGINAL AND OUTRAGEOUS FASHION
ON ONE OF THE LUMPS OF
NATIVE SILVER WAS DISCOVERED THE MINTED LEGEND TED STATES OF AND
THEN IT WAS PLAINLY APPARENT THAT THE MINE HAD BEEN SALTED WITH MELTED
HALF DOLLARS THE LUMPS THUS OBTAINED HAD BEEN BLACKENED TILL THEY
RESEMBLED NATIVE SILVER AND WERE THEN MIXED WITH THE SHATTERED ROCK IN
THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT
IT IS LITERALLY TRUE
OF COURSE THE PRICE OF
THE STOCK AT ONCE FELL TO NOTHING AND THE TRAGEDIAN WAS RUINED
BUT FOR
THIS CALAMITY WE MIGHT HAVE LOST MCKEAN BUCHANAN FROM THE STAGE
CHAPTER XLV
THE FLUSH TIMES HELD BRAVELY ON
SOMETHING OVER TWO YEARS BEFORE MR
GOODMAN AND ANOTHER JOURNEYMAN PRINTER HAD BORROWED FORTY DOLLARS AND
SET OUT FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO TRY THEIR FORTUNES IN THE NEW CITY OF
VIRGINIA
THEY FOUND THE TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE A POVERTY STRICKEN
WEEKLY JOURNAL GASPING FOR BREATH AND LIKELY TO DIE
THEY BOUGHT IT
TYPE FIXTURES GOOD WILL AND ALL FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS ON LONG TIME
THE EDITORIAL SANCTUM NEWS ROOM PRESS ROOM PUBLICATION OFFICE
BED CHAMBER PARLOR AND KITCHEN WERE ALL COMPRESSED INTO ONE APARTMENT
AND IT WAS A SMALL ONE TOO
THE EDITORS AND PRINTERS SLEPT ON THE
FLOOR A CHINAMAN DID THEIR COOKING AND THE IMPOSING STONE WAS THE
GENERAL DINNER TABLE
BUT NOW THINGS WERE CHANGED
THE PAPER WAS A
GREAT DAILY PRINTED BY STEAM THERE WERE FIVE EDITORS AND TWENTY THREE
COMPOSITORS THE SUBSCRIPTION PRICE WAS SIXTEEN DOLLARS A YEAR THE
ADVERTISING RATES WERE EXORBITANT AND THE COLUMNS CROWDED
THE PAPER
WAS CLEARING FROM SIX TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH AND THE
ENTERPRISE BUILDING WAS FINISHED AND READY FOR OCCUPATION A STATELY
FIREPROOF BRICK
EVERY DAY FROM FIVE ALL THE WAY UP TO ELEVEN COLUMNS
OF LIVE ADVERTISEMENTS WERE LEFT OUT OR CROWDED INTO SPASMODIC AND
IRREGULAR SUPPLEMENTS
THE GOULD CURRY COMPANY WERE ERECTING A MONSTER HUNDRED STAMP MILL AT
A COST THAT ULTIMATELY FELL LITTLE SHORT OF A MILLION DOLLARS
GOULD
CURRY STOCK PAID HEAVY DIVIDENDS A RARE THING AND AN EXPERIENCE
CONFINED TO THE DOZEN OR FIFTEEN CLAIMS LOCATED ON THE MAIN LEAD THE
COMSTOCK THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE GOULD CURRY LIVED RENT FREE IN
A FINE HOUSE BUILT AND FURNISHED BY THE COMPANY
HE DROVE A FINE PAIR OF
HORSES WHICH WERE A PRESENT FROM THE COMPANY AND HIS SALARY WAS TWELVE
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
THE SUPERINTENDENT OF ANOTHER OF THE GREAT
MINES TRAVELED IN GRAND STATE HAD A SALARY OF TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND
DOLLARS A YEAR AND IN A LAW SUIT IN AFTER DAYS CLAIMED THAT HE WAS TO
HAVE HAD ONE PER CENT
ON THE GROSS YIELD OF THE BULLION LIKEWISE
MONEY WAS WONDERFULLY PLENTY
THE TROUBLE WAS NOT HOW TO GET IT BUT
HOW TO SPEND IT HOW TO LAVISH IT GET RID OF IT SQUANDER IT
AND SO IT
WAS A HAPPY THING THAT JUST AT THIS JUNCTURE THE NEWS CAME OVER THE WIRES
THAT A GREAT UNITED STATES SANITARY COMMISSION HAD BEEN FORMED AND MONEY
WAS WANTED FOR THE RELIEF OF THE WOUNDED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS OF THE
UNION LANGUISHING IN THE EASTERN HOSPITALS
RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF IT
CAME WORD THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAD RESPONDED SUPERBLY BEFORE THE TELEGRAM
WAS HALF A DAY OLD
VIRGINIA ROSE AS ONE MAN A SANITARY COMMITTEE WAS
HURRIEDLY ORGANIZED AND ITS CHAIRMAN MOUNTED A VACANT CART IN C STREET
AND TRIED TO MAKE THE CLAMOROUS MULTITUDE UNDERSTAND THAT THE REST OF THE
COMMITTEE WERE FLYING HITHER AND THITHER AND WORKING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
AND MAIN AND THAT IF THE TOWN WOULD ONLY WAIT AN HOUR AN OFFICE WOULD
BE READY BOOKS OPENED AND THE COMMISSION PREPARED TO RECEIVE
CONTRIBUTIONS
HIS VOICE WAS DROWNED AND HIS INFORMATION LOST IN A
CEASELESS ROAR OF CHEERS AND DEMANDS THAT THE MONEY BE RECEIVED NOW
THEY SWORE THEY WOULD NOT WAIT
THE CHAIRMAN PLEADED AND ARGUED BUT
DEAF TO ALL ENTREATY MEN PLOWED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE THRONG AND RAINED
CHECKS OF GOLD COIN INTO THE CART AND SKURRIED AWAY FOR MORE
HANDS
CLUTCHING MONEY WERE THRUST ALOFT OUT OF THE JAM BY MEN WHO HOPED THIS
ELOQUENT APPEAL WOULD CLEAVE A ROAD THEIR STRUGGLINGS COULD NOT OPEN
THE VERY CHINAMEN AND INDIANS CAUGHT THE EXCITEMENT AND DASHED THEIR HALF
DOLLARS INTO THE CART WITHOUT KNOWING OR CARING WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT
WOMEN PLUNGED INTO THE CROWD TRIMLY ATTIRED FOUGHT THEIR WAY TO THE
CART WITH THEIR COIN AND EMERGED AGAIN BY AND BY WITH THEIR APPAREL IN
A STATE OF HOPELESS DILAPIDATION
IT WAS THE WILDEST MOB VIRGINIA HAD
EVER SEEN AND THE MOST DETERMINED AND UNGOVERNABLE AND WHEN AT LAST IT
ABATED ITS FURY AND DISPERSED IT HAD NOT A PENNY IN ITS POCKET
TO USE ITS OWN PHRASEOLOGY IT CAME THERE FLUSH AND WENT AWAY BUSTED
AFTER THAT THE COMMISSION GOT ITSELF INTO SYSTEMATIC WORKING ORDER AND
FOR WEEKS THE CONTRIBUTIONS FLOWED INTO ITS TREASURY IN A GENEROUS
STREAM
INDIVIDUALS AND ALL SORTS OF ORGANIZATIONS LEVIED UPON
THEMSELVES A REGULAR WEEKLY TAX FOR THE SANITARY FUND GRADUATED
ACCORDING TO THEIR MEANS AND THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER GRAND UNIVERSAL
OUTBURST TILL THE FAMOUS SANITARY FLOUR SACK CAME OUR WAY
ITS HISTORY
IS PECULIAR AND INTERESTING
A FORMER SCHOOLMATE OF MINE BY THE NAME OF
REUEL GRIDLEY WAS LIVING AT THE LITTLE CITY OF AUSTIN IN THE REESE
RIVER COUNTRY AT THIS TIME AND WAS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR
HE AND THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE MADE AN AGREEMENT THAT THE DEFEATED MAN
SHOULD BE PUBLICLY PRESENTED WITH A FIFTY POUND SACK OF FLOUR BY THE
SUCCESSFUL ONE AND SHOULD CARRY IT HOME ON HIS SHOULDER
GRIDLEY WAS
DEFEATED
THE NEW MAYOR GAVE HIM THE SACK OF FLOUR AND HE SHOULDERED IT
AND CARRIED IT A MILE OR TWO FROM LOWER AUSTIN TO HIS HOME IN UPPER
AUSTIN ATTENDED BY A BAND OF MUSIC AND THE WHOLE POPULATION
ARRIVED
THERE HE SAID HE DID NOT NEED THE FLOUR AND ASKED WHAT THE PEOPLE
THOUGHT HE HAD BETTER DO WITH IT
A VOICE SAID
SELL IT TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SANITARY FUND
THE SUGGESTION WAS GREETED WITH A ROUND OF APPLAUSE AND GRIDLEY MOUNTED
A DRY GOODS BOX AND ASSUMED THE ROLE OF AUCTIONEER
THE BIDS WENT HIGHER
AND HIGHER AS THE SYMPATHIES OF THE PIONEERS AWOKE AND EXPANDED TILL AT
LAST THE SACK WAS KNOCKED DOWN TO A MILL MAN AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
DOLLARS AND HIS CHECK TAKEN
HE WAS ASKED WHERE HE WOULD HAVE THE FLOUR
DELIVERED AND HE SAID
NOWHERE SELL IT AGAIN
NOW THE CHEERS WENT UP ROYALLY AND THE MULTITUDE WERE FAIRLY IN THE
SPIRIT OF THE THING
SO GRIDLEY STOOD THERE AND SHOUTED AND PERSPIRED
TILL THE SUN WENT DOWN AND WHEN THE CROWD DISPERSED HE HAD SOLD THE SACK
TO THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND HAD TAKEN IN EIGHT THOUSAND
DOLLARS IN GOLD
AND STILL THE FLOUR SACK WAS IN HIS POSSESSION
THE NEWS CAME TO VIRGINIA AND A TELEGRAM WENT BACK
FETCH ALONG YOUR FLOUR SACK
THIRTY SIX HOURS AFTERWARD GRIDLEY ARRIVED AND AN AFTERNOON MASS MEETING
WAS HELD IN THE OPERA HOUSE AND THE AUCTION BEGAN
BUT THE SACK HAD
COME SOONER THAN IT WAS EXPECTED THE PEOPLE WERE NOT THOROUGHLY AROUSED
AND THE SALE DRAGGED
AT NIGHTFALL ONLY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HAD BEEN
SECURED AND THERE WAS A CRESTFALLEN FEELING IN THE COMMUNITY
HOWEVER
THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION TO LET THE MATTER REST HERE AND ACKNOWLEDGE
VANQUISHMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE VILLAGE OF AUSTIN
TILL LATE IN THE
NIGHT THE PRINCIPAL CITIZENS WERE AT WORK ARRANGING THE MORROW'S
CAMPAIGN AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THEY HAD NO FEARS FOR THE RESULT
AT ELEVEN THE NEXT MORNING A PROCESSION OF OPEN CARRIAGES ATTENDED BY
CLAMOROUS BANDS OF MUSIC AND ADORNED WITH A MOVING DISPLAY OF FLAGS
FILED ALONG C STREET AND WAS SOON IN DANGER OF BLOCKADE BY A HUZZAING
MULTITUDE OF CITIZENS
IN THE FIRST CARRIAGE SAT GRIDLEY WITH THE FLOUR
SACK IN PROMINENT VIEW THE LATTER SPLENDID WITH BRIGHT PAINT AND GILT
LETTERING ALSO IN THE SAME CARRIAGE SAT THE MAYOR AND THE RECORDER
THE OTHER CARRIAGES CONTAINED THE COMMON COUNCIL THE EDITORS AND
REPORTERS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF IMPOSING CONSEQUENCE
THE CROWD PRESSED
TO THE CORNER OF C AND TAYLOR STREETS EXPECTING THE SALE TO BEGIN THERE
BUT THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED AND ALSO UNSPEAKABLY SURPRISED FOR THE
CAVALCADE MOVED ON AS IF VIRGINIA HAD CEASED TO BE OF IMPORTANCE AND
TOOK ITS WAY OVER THE DIVIDE TOWARD THE SMALL TOWN OF GOLD HILL
TELEGRAMS HAD GONE AHEAD TO GOLD HILL SILVER CITY AND DAYTON AND THOSE
COMMUNITIES WERE AT FEVER HEAT AND RIFE FOR THE CONFLICT
IT WAS A VERY
HOT DAY AND WONDERFULLY DUSTY
AT THE END OF A SHORT HALF HOUR WE
DESCENDED INTO GOLD HILL WITH DRUMS BEATING AND COLORS FLYING AND
ENVELOPED IN IMPOSING CLOUDS OF DUST
THE WHOLE POPULATION MEN WOMEN
AND CHILDREN CHINAMEN AND INDIANS WERE MASSED IN THE MAIN STREET ALL
THE FLAGS IN TOWN WERE AT THE MAST HEAD AND THE BLARE OF THE BANDS WAS
DROWNED IN CHEERS
GRIDLEY STOOD UP AND ASKED WHO WOULD MAKE THE FIRST
BID FOR THE NATIONAL SANITARY FLOUR SACK
GEN
W
SAID
THE YELLOW JACKET SILVER MINING COMPANY OFFERS A THOUSAND DOLLARS
COIN
A TEMPEST OF APPLAUSE FOLLOWED
A TELEGRAM CARRIED THE NEWS TO VIRGINIA
AND FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTERWARD THAT CITY'S POPULATION WAS MASSED IN THE
STREETS DEVOURING THE TIDINGS FOR IT WAS PART OF THE PROGRAMME THAT THE
BULLETIN BOARDS SHOULD DO A GOOD WORK THAT DAY
EVERY FEW MINUTES A NEW
DISPATCH WAS BULLETINED FROM GOLD HILL AND STILL THE EXCITEMENT GREW
TELEGRAMS BEGAN TO RETURN TO US FROM VIRGINIA BESEECHING GRIDLEY TO BRING
BACK THE FLOUR SACK BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE PLAN OF THE CAMPAIGN
AT THE
END OF AN HOUR GOLD HILL'S SMALL POPULATION HAD PAID A FIGURE FOR THE
FLOUR SACK THAT AWOKE ALL THE ENTHUSIASM OF VIRGINIA WHEN THE GRAND TOTAL
WAS DISPLAYED UPON THE BULLETIN BOARDS
THEN THE GRIDLEY CAVALCADE MOVED
ON A GIANT REFRESHED WITH NEW LAGER BEER AND PLENTY OF IT FOR THE
PEOPLE BROUGHT IT TO THE CARRIAGES WITHOUT WAITING TO MEASURE IT AND
WITHIN THREE HOURS MORE THE EXPEDITION HAD CARRIED SILVER CITY AND DAYTON
BY STORM AND WAS ON ITS WAY BACK COVERED WITH GLORY
EVERY MOVE HAD BEEN
TELEGRAPHED AND BULLETINED AND AS THE PROCESSION ENTERED VIRGINIA AND
FILED DOWN C STREET AT HALF PAST EIGHT IN THE EVENING THE TOWN WAS ABROAD
IN THE THOROUGHFARES TORCHES WERE GLARING FLAGS FLYING BANDS PLAYING
CHEER ON CHEER CLEAVING THE AIR AND THE CITY READY TO SURRENDER AT
DISCRETION
THE AUCTION BEGAN EVERY BID WAS GREETED WITH BURSTS OF
APPLAUSE AND AT THE END OF TWO HOURS AND A HALF A POPULATION OF FIFTEEN
THOUSAND SOULS HAD PAID IN COIN FOR A FIFTY POUND SACK OF FLOUR A SUM
EQUAL TO FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GREENBACKS IT WAS AT A RATE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THREE DOLLARS FOR EACH MAN WOMAN AND CHILD OF THE
POPULATION
THE GRAND TOTAL WOULD HAVE BEEN TWICE AS LARGE BUT THE
STREETS WERE VERY NARROW AND HUNDREDS WHO WANTED TO BID COULD NOT GET
WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE STAND AND COULD NOT MAKE THEMSELVES HEARD
THESE
GREW TIRED OF WAITING AND MANY OF THEM WENT HOME LONG BEFORE THE AUCTION
WAS OVER
THIS WAS THE GREATEST DAY VIRGINIA EVER SAW PERHAPS
GRIDLEY SOLD THE SACK IN CARSON CITY AND SEVERAL CALIFORNIA TOWNS ALSO
IN SAN FRANCISCO
THEN HE TOOK IT EAST AND SOLD IT IN ONE OR TWO
ATLANTIC CITIES I THINK
I AM NOT SURE OF THAT BUT I KNOW THAT HE
FINALLY CARRIED IT TO ST
LOUIS WHERE A MONSTER SANITARY FAIR WAS BEING
HELD AND AFTER SELLING IT THERE FOR A LARGE SUM AND HELPING ON THE
ENTHUSIASM BY DISPLAYING THE PORTLY SILVER BRICKS WHICH NEVADA'S DONATION
HAD PRODUCED HE HAD THE FLOUR BAKED UP INTO SMALL CAKES AND RETAILED
THEM AT HIGH PRICES
IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT WHEN THE FLOUR SACK'S MISSION WAS ENDED IT HAD BEEN
SOLD FOR A GRAND TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN
GREENBACKS THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY INSTANCE ON RECORD WHERE COMMON
FAMILY FLOUR BROUGHT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A POUND IN THE PUBLIC MARKET
IT IS DUE TO MR
GRIDLEY'S MEMORY TO MENTION THAT THE EXPENSES OF HIS
SANITARY FLOUR SACK EXPEDITION OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND MILES GOING AND
RETURNING WERE PAID IN LARGE PART IF NOT ENTIRELY OUT OF HIS OWN
POCKET
THE TIME HE GAVE TO IT WAS NOT LESS THAN THREE MONTHS
MR
GRIDLEY WAS A SOLDIER IN THE MEXICAN WAR AND A PIONEER CALIFORNIAN
HE DIED AT STOCKTON CALIFORNIA IN DECEMBER 1870 GREATLY REGRETTED
CHAPTER XLVI
THERE WERE NABOBS IN THOSE DAYS IN THE FLUSH TIMES I MEAN
EVERY
RICH STRIKE IN THE MINES CREATED ONE OR TWO
I CALL TO MIND SEVERAL OF
THESE
THEY WERE CARELESS EASY GOING FELLOWS AS A GENERAL THING AND
THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WAS AS MUCH BENEFITED BY THEIR RICHES AS THEY WERE
THEMSELVES POSSIBLY MORE IN SOME CASES
TWO COUSINS TEAMSTERS DID SOME HAULING FOR A MAN AND HAD TO TAKE A
SMALL SEGREGATED PORTION OF A SILVER MINE IN LIEU OF 300 CASH
THEY
GAVE AN OUTSIDER A THIRD TO OPEN THE MINE AND THEY WENT ON TEAMING
BUT
NOT LONG
TEN MONTHS AFTERWARD THE MINE WAS OUT OF DEBT AND PAYING EACH
OWNER 8 000 TO 10 000 A MONTH SAY 100 000 A YEAR
ONE OF THE EARLIEST NABOBS THAT NEVADA WAS DELIVERED OF WORE 6 000 WORTH
OF DIAMONDS IN HIS BOSOM AND SWORE HE WAS UNHAPPY BECAUSE HE COULD NOT
SPEND HIS MONEY AS FAST AS HE MADE IT
ANOTHER NEVADA NABOB BOASTED AN INCOME THAT OFTEN REACHED 16 000 A
MONTH AND HE USED TO LOVE TO TELL HOW HE HAD WORKED IN THE VERY MINE
THAT YIELDED IT FOR FIVE DOLLARS A DAY WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO THE
COUNTRY
THE SILVER AND SAGE BRUSH STATE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF ANOTHER OF THESE PETS OF
FORTUNE LIFTED FROM ACTUAL POVERTY TO AFFLUENCE ALMOST IN A SINGLE
NIGHT WHO WAS ABLE TO OFFER 100 000 FOR A POSITION OF HIGH OFFICIAL
DISTINCTION SHORTLY AFTERWARD AND DID OFFER IT BUT FAILED TO GET IT
HIS POLITICS NOT BEING AS SOUND AS HIS BANK ACCOUNT
THEN THERE WAS JOHN SMITH
HE WAS A GOOD HONEST KIND HEARTED SOUL
BORN AND REARED IN THE LOWER RANKS OF LIFE AND MIRACULOUSLY IGNORANT
HE DROVE A TEAM AND OWNED A SMALL RANCH A RANCH THAT PAID HIM A
COMFORTABLE LIVING FOR ALTHOUGH IT YIELDED BUT LITTLE HAY WHAT LITTLE
IT DID YIELD WAS WORTH FROM 250 TO 300 IN GOLD PER TON IN THE MARKET
PRESENTLY SMITH TRADED A FEW ACRES OF THE RANCH FOR A SMALL UNDEVELOPED
SILVER MINE IN GOLD HILL
HE OPENED THE MINE AND BUILT A LITTLE
UNPRETENDING TEN STAMP MILL
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AFTERWARD HE RETIRED FROM
THE HAY BUSINESS FOR HIS MINING INCOME HAD REACHED A MOST COMFORTABLE
FIGURE
SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS 30 000 A MONTH AND OTHERS SAID IT WAS
60 000
SMITH WAS VERY RICH AT ANY RATE
AND THEN HE WENT TO EUROPE AND TRAVELED
AND WHEN HE CAME BACK HE WAS
NEVER TIRED OF TELLING ABOUT THE FINE HOGS HE HAD SEEN IN ENGLAND AND
THE GORGEOUS SHEEP HE HAD SEEN IN SPAIN AND THE FINE CATTLE HE HAD
NOTICED IN THE VICINITY OF ROME
HE WAS FULL OF WONDERS OF THE OLD
WORLD AND ADVISED EVERYBODY TO TRAVEL
HE SAID A MAN NEVER IMAGINED
WHAT SURPRISING THINGS THERE WERE IN THE WORLD TILL HE HAD TRAVELED
ONE DAY ON BOARD SHIP THE PASSENGERS MADE UP A POOL OF 500 WHICH WAS
TO BE THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WHO SHOULD COME NEAREST TO GUESSING THE RUN
OF THE VESSEL FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS
NEXT DAY TOWARD NOON THE
FIGURES WERE ALL IN THE PURSER'S HANDS IN SEALED ENVELOPES
SMITH WAS
SERENE AND HAPPY FOR HE HAD BEEN BRIBING THE ENGINEER
BUT ANOTHER
PARTY WON THE PRIZE SMITH SAID
HERE THAT WON'T DO HE GUESSED TWO MILES WIDER OF THE MARK THAN I DID
THE PURSER SAID MR
SMITH YOU MISSED IT FURTHER THAN ANY MAN ON BOARD
WE TRAVELED TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILES YESTERDAY
WELL SIR SAID SMITH THAT'S JUST WHERE I'VE GOT YOU FOR I GUESSED
TWO HUNDRED AND NINE
IF YOU'LL LOOK AT MY FIGGERS AGAIN YOU'LL FIND A 2
AND TWO 0'S WHICH STANDS FOR 200 DON'T IT AND AFTER 'EM YOU'LL FIND A
9 2009 WHICH STANDS FOR TWO HUNDRED AND NINE
I RECKON I'LL TAKE THAT
MONEY IF YOU PLEASE
THE GOULD CURRY CLAIM COMPRISED TWELVE HUNDRED FEET AND IT ALL
BELONGED ORIGINALLY TO THE TWO MEN WHOSE NAMES IT BEARS
MR
CURRY OWNED
TWO THIRDS OF IT AND HE SAID THAT HE SOLD IT OUT FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED
DOLLARS IN CASH AND AN OLD PLUG HORSE THAT ATE UP HIS MARKET VALUE IN
HAY AND BARLEY IN SEVENTEEN DAYS BY THE WATCH
AND HE SAID THAT GOULD
SOLD OUT FOR A PAIR OF SECOND HAND GOVERNMENT BLANKETS AND A BOTTLE OF
WHISKY THAT KILLED NINE MEN IN THREE HOURS AND THAT AN UNOFFENDING
STRANGER THAT SMELT THE CORK WAS DISABLED FOR LIFE
FOUR YEARS AFTERWARD
THE MINE THUS DISPOSED OF WAS WORTH IN THE SAN FRANCISCO MARKET SEVEN
MILLIONS SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GOLD COIN
IN THE EARLY DAYS A POVERTY STRICKEN MEXICAN WHO LIVED IN A CANYON
DIRECTLY BACK OF VIRGINIA CITY HAD A STREAM OF WATER AS LARGE AS A MAN'S
WRIST TRICKLING FROM THE HILL SIDE ON HIS PREMISES
THE OPHIR COMPANY
SEGREGATED A HUNDRED FEET OF THEIR MINE AND TRADED IT TO HIM FOR THE
STREAM OF WATER
THE HUNDRED FEET PROVED TO BE THE RICHEST PART OF THE
ENTIRE MINE FOUR YEARS AFTER THE SWAP ITS MARKET VALUE INCLUDING ITS
MILL WAS 1 500 000
AN INDIVIDUAL WHO OWNED TWENTY FEET IN THE OPHIR MINE BEFORE ITS GREAT
RICHES WERE REVEALED TO MEN TRADED IT FOR A HORSE AND A VERY SORRY
LOOKING BRUTE HE WAS TOO
A YEAR OR SO AFTERWARD WHEN OPHIR STOCK WENT
UP TO 3 000 A FOOT THIS MAN WHO HAD NOT A CENT USED TO SAY HE WAS THE
MOST STARTLING EXAMPLE OF MAGNIFICENCE AND MISERY THE WORLD HAD EVER
SEEN BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO RIDE A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HORSE YET
COULD NOT SCRAPE UP CASH ENOUGH TO BUY A SADDLE AND WAS OBLIGED TO
BORROW ONE OR RIDE BAREBACK
HE SAID IF FORTUNE WERE TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER
SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HORSE IT WOULD RUIN HIM
A YOUTH OF NINETEEN WHO WAS A TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN VIRGINIA ON A SALARY
OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND WHO WHEN HE COULD NOT MAKE OUT GERMAN
NAMES IN THE LIST OF SAN FRANCISCO STEAMER ARRIVALS USED TO INGENIOUSLY
SELECT AND SUPPLY SUBSTITUTES FOR THEM OUT OF AN OLD BERLIN CITY
DIRECTORY MADE HIMSELF RICH BY WATCHING THE MINING TELEGRAMS THAT PASSED
THROUGH HIS HANDS AND BUYING AND SELLING STOCKS ACCORDINGLY THROUGH A
FRIEND IN SAN FRANCISCO
ONCE WHEN A PRIVATE DISPATCH WAS SENT FROM
VIRGINIA ANNOUNCING A RICH STRIKE IN A PROMINENT MINE AND ADVISING THAT
THE MATTER BE KEPT SECRET TILL A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE STOCK COULD BE
SECURED HE BOUGHT FORTY FEET OF THE STOCK AT TWENTY DOLLARS A FOOT
AND AFTERWARD SOLD HALF OF IT AT EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT AND THE
REST AT DOUBLE THAT FIGURE
WITHIN THREE MONTHS HE WAS WORTH 150 000
AND HAD RESIGNED HIS TELEGRAPHIC POSITION
ANOTHER TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WHO HAD BEEN DISCHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR
DIVULGING THE SECRETS OF THE OFFICE AGREED WITH A MONEYED MAN IN SAN
FRANCISCO TO FURNISH HIM THE RESULT OF A GREAT VIRGINIA MINING LAWSUIT
WITHIN AN HOUR AFTER ITS PRIVATE RECEPTION BY THE PARTIES TO IT IN SAN
FRANCISCO
FOR THIS HE WAS TO HAVE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PROFITS ON
PURCHASES AND SALES MADE ON IT BY HIS FELLOW CONSPIRATOR
SO HE WENT
DISGUISED AS A TEAMSTER TO A LITTLE WAYSIDE TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN THE
MOUNTAINS GOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE OPERATOR AND SAT IN THE OFFICE DAY
AFTER DAY SMOKING HIS PIPE COMPLAINING THAT HIS TEAM WAS FAGGED OUT AND
UNABLE TO TRAVEL AND MEANTIME LISTENING TO THE DISPATCHES AS THEY PASSED
CLICKING THROUGH THE MACHINE FROM VIRGINIA
FINALLY THE PRIVATE DISPATCH
ANNOUNCING THE RESULT OF THE LAWSUIT SPED OVER THE WIRES AND AS SOON AS
HE HEARD IT HE TELEGRAPHED HIS FRIEND IN SAN FRANCISCO
AM TIRED WAITING
SHALL SELL THE TEAM AND GO HOME
IT WAS THE SIGNAL AGREED UPON
THE WORD WAITING LEFT OUT WOULD HAVE
SIGNIFIED THAT THE SUIT HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY
THE MOCK TEAMSTER'S FRIEND PICKED UP A DEAL OF THE MINING STOCK AT LOW
FIGURES BEFORE THE NEWS BECAME PUBLIC AND A FORTUNE WAS THE RESULT
FOR A LONG TIME AFTER ONE OF THE GREAT VIRGINIA MINES HAD BEEN
INCORPORATED ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF THE ORIGINAL LOCATION WERE STILL IN THE
HANDS OF A MAN WHO HAD NEVER SIGNED THE INCORPORATION PAPERS
THE STOCK
BECAME VERY VALUABLE AND EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO FIND THIS MAN BUT HE
HAD DISAPPEARED
ONCE IT WAS HEARD THAT HE WAS IN NEW YORK AND ONE OR
TWO SPECULATORS WENT EAST BUT FAILED TO FIND HIM
ONCE THE NEWS CAME
THAT HE WAS IN THE BERMUDAS AND STRAIGHTWAY A SPECULATOR OR TWO HURRIED
EAST AND SAILED FOR BERMUDA BUT HE WAS NOT THERE
FINALLY HE WAS HEARD
OF IN MEXICO AND A FRIEND OF HIS A BAR KEEPER ON A SALARY SCRAPED
TOGETHER A LITTLE MONEY AND SOUGHT HIM OUT BOUGHT HIS FEET FOR A
HUNDRED DOLLARS RETURNED AND SOLD THE PROPERTY FOR 75 000
BUT WHY GO ON THE TRADITIONS OF SILVERLAND ARE FILLED WITH INSTANCES
LIKE THESE AND I WOULD NEVER GET THROUGH ENUMERATING THEM WERE I TO
ATTEMPT DO IT
I ONLY DESIRED TO GIVE THE READER AN IDEA OF A
PECULIARITY OF THE FLUSH TIMES WHICH I COULD NOT PRESENT SO STRIKINGLY
IN ANY OTHER WAY AND WHICH SOME MENTION OF WAS NECESSARY TO A REALIZING
COMPREHENSION OF THE TIME AND THE COUNTRY
I WAS PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE NABOBS I HAVE
REFERRED TO AND SO FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE I HAVE SHIFTED THEIR
OCCUPATIONS AND EXPERIENCES AROUND IN SUCH A WAY AS TO KEEP THE PACIFIC
PUBLIC FROM RECOGNIZING THESE ONCE NOTORIOUS MEN
NO LONGER NOTORIOUS
FOR THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE DRIFTED BACK INTO POVERTY AND OBSCURITY
AGAIN
IN NEVADA THERE USED TO BE CURRENT THE STORY OF AN ADVENTURE OF TWO OF
HER NABOBS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE OCCURRED
I GIVE IT FOR WHAT IT IS
WORTH
COL
JIM HAD SEEN SOMEWHAT OF THE WORLD AND KNEW MORE OR LESS OF ITS
WAYS BUT COL
JACK WAS FROM THE BACK SETTLEMENTS OF THE STATES HAD LED
A LIFE OF ARDUOUS TOIL AND HAD NEVER SEEN A CITY
THESE TWO BLESSED
WITH SUDDEN WEALTH PROJECTED A VISIT TO NEW YORK COL
JACK TO SEE THE
SIGHTS AND COL
JIM TO GUARD HIS UNSOPHISTICATION FROM MISFORTUNE
THEY
REACHED SAN FRANCISCO IN THE NIGHT AND SAILED IN THE MORNING
ARRIVED
IN NEW YORK COL
JACK SAID
I'VE HEARD TELL OF CARRIAGES ALL MY LIFE AND NOW I MEAN TO HAVE A RIDE
IN ONE I DON'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS

THEY STEPPED OUT ON THE SIDEWALK AND COL
JIM CALLED A STYLISH BAROUCHE
BUT COL
JACK SAID

THAT'S GOING
NOW HERE COMES THE VERY TRICK
STOP THAT YALLER ONE WITH

SO COL
JIM STOPPED AN EMPTY OMNIBUS AND THEY GOT IN

JACK

THE DRIVER PASSED HIS HAND THROUGH THE STRAP HOLE AND TAPPED FOR HIS
FARE IT WAS BEFORE THE GONGS CAME INTO COMMON USE
COL
JACK TOOK THE
HAND AND SHOOK IT CORDIALLY
HE SAID
YOU TWIG ME OLD PARD ALL RIGHT BETWEEN GENTS
SMELL OF THAT AND SEE
HOW YOU LIKE IT
AND HE PUT A TWENTY DOLLAR GOLD PIECE IN THE DRIVER'S HAND
AFTER A
MOMENT THE DRIVER SAID HE COULD NOT MAKE CHANGE
BOTHER THE CHANGE RIDE IT OUT
PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET
THEN TO COL
JIM WITH A SOUNDING SLAP ON HIS THIGH
AIN'T IT STYLE THOUGH HANGED IF I DON'T HIRE THIS THING EVERY DAY FOR
A WEEK
THE OMNIBUS STOPPED AND A YOUNG LADY GOT IN
COL
JACK STARED A MOMENT
THEN NUDGED COL
JIM WITH HIS ELBOW
DON'T SAY A WORD HE WHISPERED
LET HER RIDE IF SHE WANTS TO
GRACIOUS THERE'S ROOM ENOUGH
THE YOUNG LADY GOT OUT HER PORTE MONNAIE AND HANDED HER FARE TO COL
JACK

GIVE IT TO THE DRIVER PLEASE

WE CAN'T ALLOW IT
YOU'RE WELCOME TO RIDE
HERE AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE BUT THIS SHEBANG'S CHARTERED AND WE CAN'T

THE GIRL SHRUNK INTO A CORNER BEWILDERED

JACK

JACK DON'T MIND US
THIS IS A
FREE BLOW OUT THEN HE WHISPERED TO COL
JIM
NEW YORK AIN'T NO SOCIABLE PLACE I DON'T RECKON IT AIN'T NO NAME FOR
IT
HE RESISTED EVERY EFFORT TO PASS FARES TO THE DRIVER AND MADE EVERYBODY
CORDIALLY WELCOME
THE SITUATION DAWNED ON THE PEOPLE AND THEY POCKETED
THEIR MONEY AND DELIVERED THEMSELVES UP TO COVERT ENJOYMENT OF THE
EPISODE
HALF A DOZEN MORE PASSENGERS ENTERED
OH THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM SAID COL
JACK
WALK RIGHT IN AND MAKE
YOURSELVES AT HOME
A BLOW OUT AIN'T WORTH ANYTHING AS A BLOW OUT
UNLESS A BODY HAS COMPANY THEN IN A WHISPER TO COL
JIM BUT AIN'T

AIN'T ANYWHERE
I RECKON THEY'D TACKLE A HEARSE IF IT WAS GOING THEIR

MORE PASSENGERS GOT IN MORE YET AND STILL MORE
BOTH SEATS WERE
FILLED AND A FILE OF MEN WERE STANDING UP HOLDING ON TO THE CLEATS
OVERHEAD
PARTIES WITH BASKETS AND BUNDLES WERE CLIMBING UP ON THE ROOF

COMFORTABLE AS ANYBODY
IF WE'D STAID AWHILE I RECKON WE'D HAD SOME
NIGGERS
B' GEORGE WE'LL HAVE TO BARRICADE OUR DOORS TO NIGHT OR SOME
OF THESE DUCKS WILL BE TRYING TO SLEEP WITH US
CHAPTER XLVII
SOMEBODY HAS SAID THAT IN ORDER TO KNOW A COMMUNITY ONE MUST OBSERVE THE
STYLE OF ITS FUNERALS AND KNOW WHAT MANNER OF MEN THEY BURY WITH MOST
CEREMONY
I CANNOT SAY WHICH CLASS WE BURIED WITH MOST ECLAT IN OUR
FLUSH TIMES THE DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC BENEFACTOR OR THE DISTINGUISHED
ROUGH POSSIBLY THE TWO CHIEF GRADES OR GRAND DIVISIONS OF SOCIETY
HONORED THEIR ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD ABOUT EQUALLY AND HENCE NO DOUBT THE
PHILOSOPHER I HAVE QUOTED FROM WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO SEE TWO
REPRESENTATIVE FUNERALS IN VIRGINIA BEFORE FORMING HIS ESTIMATE OF THE
PEOPLE
THERE WAS A GRAND TIME OVER BUCK FANSHAW WHEN HE DIED
HE WAS A
REPRESENTATIVE CITIZEN
HE HAD KILLED HIS MAN NOT IN HIS OWN QUARREL
IT IS TRUE BUT IN DEFENCE OF A STRANGER UNFAIRLY BESET BY NUMBERS
HE HAD KEPT A SUMPTUOUS SALOON
HE HAD BEEN THE PROPRIETOR OF A DASHING
HELPMEET WHOM HE COULD HAVE DISCARDED WITHOUT THE FORMALITY OF A DIVORCE
HE HAD HELD A HIGH POSITION IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND BEEN A VERY
WARWICK IN POLITICS
WHEN HE DIED THERE WAS GREAT LAMENTATION THROUGHOUT
THE TOWN BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE VAST BOTTOM STRATUM OF SOCIETY
ON THE INQUEST IT WAS SHOWN THAT BUCK FANSHAW IN THE DELIRIUM OF A
WASTING TYPHOID FEVER HAD TAKEN ARSENIC SHOT HIMSELF THROUGH THE BODY
CUT HIS THROAT AND JUMPED OUT OF A FOUR STORY WINDOW AND BROKEN HIS
NECK AND AFTER DUE DELIBERATION THE JURY SAD AND TEARFUL BUT WITH
INTELLIGENCE UNBLINDED BY ITS SORROW BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF DEATH BY
THE VISITATION OF GOD WHAT COULD THE WORLD DO WITHOUT JURIES
PRODIGIOUS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE FUNERAL
ALL THE VEHICLES IN
TOWN WERE HIRED ALL THE SALOONS PUT IN MOURNING ALL THE MUNICIPAL AND
FIRE COMPANY FLAGS HUNG AT HALF MAST AND ALL THE FIREMEN ORDERED TO
MUSTER IN UNIFORM AND BRING THEIR MACHINES DULY DRAPED IN BLACK
NOW
LET US REMARK IN PARENTHESIS AS ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH HAD
REPRESENTATIVE ADVENTURERS IN THE SILVERLAND AND AS EACH ADVENTURER HAD
BROUGHT THE SLANG OF HIS NATION OR HIS LOCALITY WITH HIM THE COMBINATION
MADE THE SLANG OF NEVADA THE RICHEST AND THE MOST INFINITELY VARIED AND
COPIOUS THAT HAD EVER EXISTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD PERHAPS EXCEPT IN
THE MINES OF CALIFORNIA IN THE EARLY DAYS SLANG WAS THE LANGUAGE OF
NEVADA
IT WAS HARD TO PREACH A SERMON WITHOUT IT AND BE UNDERSTOOD
SUCH PHRASES AS YOU BET OH NO I RECKON NOT NO IRISH NEED
APPLY AND A HUNDRED OTHERS BECAME SO COMMON AS TO FALL FROM THE LIPS
OF A SPEAKER UNCONSCIOUSLY AND VERY OFTEN WHEN THEY DID NOT TOUCH THE
SUBJECT UNDER DISCUSSION AND CONSEQUENTLY FAILED TO MEAN ANYTHING
AFTER BUCK FANSHAW'S INQUEST A MEETING OF THE SHORT HAIRED BROTHERHOOD
WAS HELD FOR NOTHING CAN BE DONE ON THE PACIFIC COAST WITHOUT A PUBLIC
MEETING AND AN EXPRESSION OF SENTIMENT
REGRETFUL RESOLUTIONS WERE
PASSED AND VARIOUS COMMITTEES APPOINTED AMONG OTHERS A COMMITTEE OF ONE
WAS DEPUTED TO CALL ON THE MINISTER A FRAGILE GENTLE SPIRITUAL NEW
FLEDGLING FROM AN EASTERN THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY AND AS YET UNACQUAINTED
WITH THE WAYS OF THE MINES
THE COMMITTEEMAN SCOTTY BRIGGS MADE HIS
VISIT AND IN AFTER DAYS IT WAS WORTH SOMETHING TO HEAR THE MINISTER TELL
ABOUT IT
SCOTTY WAS A STALWART ROUGH WHOSE CUSTOMARY SUIT WHEN ON
WEIGHTY OFFICIAL BUSINESS LIKE COMMITTEE WORK WAS A FIRE HELMET
FLAMING RED FLANNEL SHIRT PATENT LEATHER BELT WITH SPANNER AND REVOLVER
ATTACHED COAT HUNG OVER ARM AND PANTS STUFFED INTO BOOT TOPS
HE FORMED SOMETHING OF A CONTRAST TO THE PALE THEOLOGICAL STUDENT
IT IS
FAIR TO SAY OF SCOTTY HOWEVER IN PASSING THAT HE HAD A WARM HEART AND
A STRONG LOVE FOR HIS FRIENDS AND NEVER ENTERED INTO A QUARREL WHEN HE
COULD REASONABLY KEEP OUT OF IT
INDEED IT WAS COMMONLY SAID THAT
WHENEVER ONE OF SCOTTY'S FIGHTS WAS INVESTIGATED IT ALWAYS TURNED OUT
THAT IT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN NO AFFAIR OF HIS BUT THAT OUT OF NATIVE
GOOD HEARTEDNESS HE HAD DROPPED IN OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO HELP THE MAN WHO
WAS GETTING THE WORST OF IT
HE AND BUCK FANSHAW WERE BOSOM FRIENDS FOR
YEARS AND HAD OFTEN TAKEN ADVENTUROUS POT LUCK TOGETHER
ON ONE
OCCASION THEY HAD THROWN OFF THEIR COATS AND TAKEN THE WEAKER SIDE IN A
FIGHT AMONG STRANGERS AND AFTER GAINING A HARD EARNED VICTORY TURNED
AND FOUND THAT THE MEN THEY WERE HELPING HAD DESERTED EARLY AND NOT ONLY
THAT BUT HAD STOLEN THEIR COATS AND MADE OFF WITH THEM BUT TO RETURN
TO SCOTTY'S VISIT TO THE MINISTER
HE WAS ON A SORROWFUL MISSION NOW
AND HIS FACE WAS THE PICTURE OF WOE
BEING ADMITTED TO THE PRESENCE HE
SAT DOWN BEFORE THE CLERGYMAN PLACED HIS FIRE HAT ON AN UNFINISHED
MANUSCRIPT SERMON UNDER THE MINISTER'S NOSE TOOK FROM IT A RED SILK
HANDKERCHIEF WIPED HIS BROW AND HEAVED A SIGH OF DISMAL IMPRESSIVENESS
EXPLANATORY OF HIS BUSINESS
HE CHOKED AND EVEN SHED TEARS BUT WITH AN EFFORT HE MASTERED HIS VOICE
AND SAID IN LUGUBRIOUS TONES
ARE YOU THE DUCK THAT RUNS THE GOSPEL MILL NEXT DOOR
AM I THE PARDON ME I BELIEVE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
WITH ANOTHER SIGH AND A HALF SOB SCOTTY REJOINED
WHY YOU SEE WE ARE IN A BIT OF TROUBLE AND THE BOYS THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
WOULD GIVE US A LIFT IF WE'D TACKLE YOU THAT IS IF I'VE GOT THE RIGHTS
OF IT AND YOU ARE THE HEAD CLERK OF THE DOXOLOGY WORKS NEXT DOOR
I AM THE SHEPHERD IN CHARGE OF THE FLOCK WHOSE FOLD IS NEXT DOOR
THE WHICH
THE SPIRITUAL ADVISER OF THE LITTLE COMPANY OF BELIEVERS WHOSE SANCTUARY
ADJOINS THESE PREMISES
SCOTTY SCRATCHED HIS HEAD REFLECTED A MOMENT AND THEN SAID
YOU RUTHER HOLD OVER ME PARD
I RECKON I CAN'T CALL THAT HAND
ANTE
AND PASS THE BUCK
HOW I BEG PARDON
WHAT DID I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY
WELL YOU'VE RUTHER GOT THE BULGE ON ME
OR MAYBE WE'VE BOTH GOT THE
BULGE SOMEHOW
YOU DON'T SMOKE ME AND I DON'T SMOKE YOU
YOU SEE ONE
OF THE BOYS HAS PASSED IN HIS CHECKS AND WE WANT TO GIVE HIM A GOOD
SEND OFF AND SO THE THING I'M ON NOW IS TO ROUST OUT SOMEBODY TO JERK
A LITTLE CHIN MUSIC FOR US AND WALTZ HIM THROUGH HANDSOME
MY FRIEND I SEEM TO GROW MORE AND MORE BEWILDERED
YOUR OBSERVATIONS
ARE WHOLLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME
CANNOT YOU SIMPLIFY THEM IN SOME WAY
AT FIRST I THOUGHT PERHAPS I UNDERSTOOD YOU BUT I GROPE NOW
WOULD IT
NOT EXPEDITE MATTERS IF YOU RESTRICTED YOURSELF TO CATEGORICAL STATEMENTS
OF FACT UNENCUMBERED WITH OBSTRUCTING ACCUMULATIONS OF METAPHOR AND
ALLEGORY
ANOTHER PAUSE AND MORE REFLECTION
THEN SAID SCOTTY
I'LL HAVE TO PASS I JUDGE
HOW
YOU'VE RAISED ME OUT PARD
I STILL FAIL TO CATCH YOUR MEANING
WHY THAT LAST LEAD OF YOURN IS TOO MANY FOR ME THAT'S THE IDEA
I
CAN'T NEITHER TRUMP NOR FOLLOW SUIT
THE CLERGYMAN SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR PERPLEXED
SCOTTY LEANED HIS HEAD
ON HIS HAND AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO THOUGHT
PRESENTLY HIS FACE CAME UP SORROWFUL BUT CONFIDENT
I'VE GOT IT NOW SO'S YOU CAN SAVVY HE SAID
WHAT WE WANT IS A
GOSPEL SHARP
SEE
A WHAT
GOSPEL SHARP
PARSON
OH WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE I AM A CLERGYMAN A PARSON
NOW YOU TALK YOU SEE MY BLIND AND STRADDLE IT LIKE A MAN
PUT IT
THERE EXTENDING A BRAWNY PAW WHICH CLOSED OVER THE MINISTER'S SMALL
HAND AND GAVE IT A SHAKE INDICATIVE OF FRATERNAL SYMPATHY AND FERVENT
GRATIFICATION
NOW WE'RE ALL RIGHT PARD
LET'S START FRESH
DON'T YOU MIND MY
SNUFFLING A LITTLE BECUZ WE'RE IN A POWER OF TROUBLE
YOU SEE ONE OF
THE BOYS HAS GONE UP THE FLUME
GONE WHERE
UP THE FLUME THROWED UP THE SPONGE YOU UNDERSTAND
THROWN UP THE SPONGE
YES KICKED THE BUCKET
AH HAS DEPARTED TO THAT MYSTERIOUS COUNTRY FROM WHOSE BOURNE NO
TRAVELER RETURNS
RETURN I RECKON NOT
WHY PARD HE'S DEAD
YES I UNDERSTAND
OH YOU DO WELL I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU MIGHT BE GETTING TANGLED SOME
MORE
YES YOU SEE HE'S DEAD AGAIN
AGAIN WHY HAS HE EVER BEEN DEAD BEFORE
DEAD BEFORE NO DO YOU RECKON A MAN HAS GOT AS MANY LIVES AS A CAT
BUT YOU BET YOU HE'S AWFUL DEAD NOW POOR OLD BOY AND I WISH I'D NEVER
SEEN THIS DAY
I DON'T WANT NO BETTER FRIEND THAN BUCK FANSHAW
I KNOWED HIM BY THE BACK AND WHEN I KNOW A MAN AND LIKE HIM I FREEZE TO
HIM YOU HEAR ME
TAKE HIM ALL ROUND PARD THERE NEVER WAS A BULLIER
MAN IN THE MINES
NO MAN EVER KNOWED BUCK FANSHAW TO GO BACK ON A
FRIEND
BUT IT'S ALL UP YOU KNOW IT'S ALL UP
IT AIN'T NO USE
THEY'VE SCOOPED HIM
SCOOPED HIM
YES DEATH HAS
WELL WELL WELL WE'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM UP
YES
INDEED
IT'S A KIND OF A HARD WORLD AFTER ALL AIN'T IT BUT PARD HE
WAS A RUSTLER YOU OUGHT TO SEEN HIM GET STARTED ONCE
HE WAS A BULLY
BOY WITH A GLASS EYE JUST SPIT IN HIS FACE AND GIVE HIM ROOM ACCORDING
TO HIS STRENGTH AND IT WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL TO SEE HIM PEEL AND GO IN
HE WAS THE WORST SON OF A THIEF THAT EVER DRAWED BREATH
PARD HE WAS ON
IT HE WAS ON IT BIGGER THAN AN INJUN
ON IT ON WHAT
ON THE SHOOT
ON THE SHOULDER
ON THE FIGHT YOU UNDERSTAND
HE DIDN'T GIVE A CONTINENTAL FOR ANY BODY
BEG YOUR PARDON FRIEND FOR
COMING SO NEAR SAYING A CUSS WORD BUT YOU SEE I'M ON AN AWFUL STRAIN IN
THIS PALAVER ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING TO CRAMP DOWN AND DRAW EVERYTHING SO
MILD
BUT WE'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM UP
THERE AIN'T ANY GETTING AROUND
THAT I DON'T RECKON
NOW IF WE CAN GET YOU TO HELP PLANT HIM
PREACH THE FUNERAL DISCOURSE ASSIST AT THE OBSEQUIES
OBS'QUIES IS GOOD
YES
THAT'S IT THAT'S OUR LITTLE GAME
WE ARE
GOING TO GET THE THING UP REGARDLESS YOU KNOW
HE WAS ALWAYS NIFTY
HIMSELF AND SO YOU BET YOU HIS FUNERAL AIN'T GOING TO BE NO SLOUCH
SOLID SILVER DOOR PLATE ON HIS COFFIN SIX PLUMES ON THE HEARSE AND A
NIGGER ON THE BOX IN A BILED SHIRT AND A PLUG HAT HOW'S THAT FOR HIGH
AND WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU PARD
WE'LL FIX YOU ALL RIGHT
THERE'LL BE
A KERRIDGE FOR YOU AND WHATEVER YOU WANT YOU JUST 'SCAPE OUT AND WE'LL
'TEND TO IT
WE'VE GOT A SHEBANG FIXED UP FOR YOU TO STAND BEHIND IN
NO
1'S HOUSE AND DON'T YOU BE AFRAID
JUST GO IN AND TOOT YOUR HORN
IF YOU DON'T SELL A CLAM
PUT BUCK THROUGH AS BULLY AS YOU CAN PARD
FOR ANYBODY THAT KNOWED HIM WILL TELL YOU THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE WHITEST
MEN THAT WAS EVER IN THE MINES
YOU CAN'T DRAW IT TOO STRONG
HE NEVER
COULD STAND IT TO SEE THINGS GOING WRONG
HE'S DONE MORE TO MAKE THIS
TOWN QUIET AND PEACEABLE THAN ANY MAN IN IT
I'VE SEEN HIM LICK FOUR
GREASERS IN ELEVEN MINUTES MYSELF
IF A THING WANTED REGULATING HE
WARN'T A MAN TO GO BROWSING AROUND AFTER SOMEBODY TO DO IT BUT HE WOULD
PRANCE IN AND REGULATE IT HIMSELF
HE WARN'T A CATHOLIC
SCASELY
HE
WAS DOWN ON 'EM
HIS WORD WAS 'NO IRISH NEED APPLY BUT IT DIDN'T
MAKE NO DIFFERENCE ABOUT THAT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO WHAT A MAN'S RIGHTS
WAS AND SO WHEN SOME ROUGHS JUMPED THE CATHOLIC BONE YARD AND STARTED
IN TO STAKE OUT TOWN LOTS IN IT HE WENT FOR 'EM AND HE CLEANED 'EM
TOO I WAS THERE PARD AND I SEEN IT MYSELF
THAT WAS VERY WELL INDEED AT LEAST THE IMPULSE WAS WHETHER THE ACT WAS
STRICTLY DEFENSIBLE OR NOT
HAD DECEASED ANY RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
THAT IS TO SAY DID HE FEEL A DEPENDENCE UPON OR ACKNOWLEDGE ALLEGIANCE
TO A HIGHER POWER
MORE REFLECTION
I RECKON YOU'VE STUMPED ME AGAIN PARD
COULD YOU SAY IT OVER ONCE
MORE AND SAY IT SLOW
WELL TO SIMPLIFY IT SOMEWHAT WAS HE OR RATHER HAD HE EVER BEEN
CONNECTED WITH ANY ORGANIZATION SEQUESTERED FROM SECULAR CONCERNS AND
DEVOTED TO SELF SACRIFICE IN THE INTERESTS OF MORALITY
ALL DOWN BUT NINE SET 'EM UP ON THE OTHER ALLEY PARD
WHAT DID I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY
WHY YOU'RE MOST TOO MANY FOR ME YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU GET IN WITH YOUR
LEFT I HUNT GRASS EVERY TIME
EVERY TIME YOU DRAW YOU FILL BUT I DON'T
SEEM TO HAVE ANY LUCK
LETS HAVE A NEW DEAL
HOW BEGIN AGAIN
THAT'S IT
VERY WELL
WAS HE A GOOD MAN AND
THERE I SEE THAT DON'T PUT UP ANOTHER CHIP TILL I LOOK AT MY HAND
A GOOD MAN SAYS YOU PARD IT AIN'T NO NAME FOR IT
HE WAS THE BEST
MAN THAT EVER PARD YOU WOULD HAVE DOTED ON THAT MAN
HE COULD LAM ANY
GALOOT OF HIS INCHES IN AMERICA
IT WAS HIM THAT PUT DOWN THE RIOT LAST
ELECTION BEFORE IT GOT A START AND EVERYBODY SAID HE WAS THE ONLY MAN
THAT COULD HAVE DONE IT
HE WALTZED IN WITH A SPANNER IN ONE HAND AND A
TRUMPET IN THE OTHER AND SENT FOURTEEN MEN HOME ON A SHUTTER IN LESS
THAN THREE MINUTES
HE HAD THAT RIOT ALL BROKE UP AND PREVENTED NICE
BEFORE ANYBODY EVER GOT A CHANCE TO STRIKE A BLOW
HE WAS ALWAYS FOR
PEACE AND HE WOULD HAVE PEACE HE COULD NOT STAND DISTURBANCES
PARD
HE WAS A GREAT LOSS TO THIS TOWN
IT WOULD PLEASE THE BOYS IF YOU COULD
CHIP IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND DO HIM JUSTICE
HERE ONCE WHEN THE MICKS
GOT TO THROWING STONES THROUGH THE METHODIS' SUNDAY SCHOOL WINDOWS BUCK
FANSHAW ALL OF HIS OWN NOTION SHUT UP HIS SALOON AND TOOK A COUPLE OF
SIX SHOOTERS AND MOUNTED GUARD OVER THE SUNDAY SCHOOL
SAYS HE 'NO
IRISH NEED APPLY AND THEY DIDN'T
HE WAS THE BULLIEST MAN IN THE
MOUNTAINS PARD HE COULD RUN FASTER JUMP HIGHER HIT HARDER AND HOLD
MORE TANGLE FOOT WHISKY WITHOUT SPILLING IT THAN ANY MAN IN SEVENTEEN
COUNTIES
PUT THAT IN PARD IT'LL PLEASE THE BOYS MORE THAN ANYTHING
YOU COULD SAY
AND YOU CAN SAY PARD THAT HE NEVER SHOOK HIS MOTHER
NEVER SHOOK HIS MOTHER
THAT'S IT ANY OF THE BOYS WILL TELL YOU SO
WELL BUT WHY SHOULD HE SHAKE HER
THAT'S WHAT I SAY BUT SOME PEOPLE DOES
NOT PEOPLE OF ANY REPUTE
WELL SOME THAT AVERAGES PRETTY SO SO
IN MY OPINION THE MAN THAT WOULD OFFER PERSONAL VIOLENCE TO HIS OWN
MOTHER OUGHT TO
CHEESE IT PARD YOU'VE BANKED YOUR BALL CLEAN OUTSIDE THE STRING
WHAT I WAS A DRIVIN' AT WAS THAT HE NEVER THROWED OFF ON HIS MOTHER
DON'T YOU SEE NO INDEEDY
HE GIVE HER A HOUSE TO LIVE IN AND TOWN
LOTS AND PLENTY OF MONEY AND HE LOOKED AFTER HER AND TOOK CARE OF HER
ALL THE TIME AND WHEN SHE WAS DOWN WITH THE SMALL POX I'M D D IF HE
DIDN'T SET UP NIGHTS AND NUSS HER HIMSELF BEG YOUR PARDON FOR SAYING
IT BUT IT HOPPED OUT TOO QUICK FOR YOURS TRULY
YOU'VE TREATED ME LIKE A GENTLEMAN PARD AND I AIN'T THE MAN TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS INTENTIONAL
I THINK YOU'RE WHITE
I THINK YOU'RE A
SQUARE MAN PARD
I LIKE YOU AND I'LL LICK ANY MAN THAT DON'T
I'LL
LICK HIM TILL HE CAN'T TELL HIMSELF FROM A LAST YEAR'S CORPSE PUT IT
THERE ANOTHER FRATERNAL HAND SHAKE AND EXIT
THE OBSEQUIES WERE ALL THAT THE BOYS COULD DESIRE
SUCH A MARVEL OF
FUNERAL POMP HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN IN VIRGINIA
THE PLUMED HEARSE THE
DIRGE BREATHING BRASS BANDS THE CLOSED MARTS OF BUSINESS THE FLAGS
DROOPING AT HALF MAST THE LONG PLODDING PROCESSION OF UNIFORMED SECRET
SOCIETIES MILITARY BATTALIONS AND FIRE COMPANIES DRAPED ENGINES
CARRIAGES OF OFFICIALS AND CITIZENS IN VEHICLES AND ON FOOT ATTRACTED
MULTITUDES OF SPECTATORS TO THE SIDEWALKS ROOFS AND WINDOWS AND FOR
YEARS AFTERWARD THE DEGREE OF GRANDEUR ATTAINED BY ANY CIVIC DISPLAY IN
VIRGINIA WAS DETERMINED BY COMPARISON WITH BUCK FANSHAW'S FUNERAL
SCOTTY BRIGGS AS A PALL BEARER AND A MOURNER OCCUPIED A PROMINENT PLACE
AT THE FUNERAL AND WHEN THE SERMON WAS FINISHED AND THE LAST SENTENCE OF
THE PRAYER FOR THE DEAD MAN'S SOUL ASCENDED HE RESPONDED IN A LOW
VOICE BUT WITH FEELINGS
AMEN
NO IRISH NEED APPLY
AS THE BULK OF THE RESPONSE WAS WITHOUT APPARENT RELEVANCY IT WAS
PROBABLY NOTHING MORE THAN A HUMBLE TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE FRIEND
THAT WAS GONE FOR AS SCOTTY HAD ONCE SAID IT WAS HIS WORD
SCOTTY BRIGGS IN AFTER DAYS ACHIEVED THE DISTINCTION OF BECOMING THE
ONLY CONVERT TO RELIGION THAT WAS EVER GATHERED FROM THE VIRGINIA ROUGHS
AND IT TRANSPIRED THAT THE MAN WHO HAD IT IN HIM TO ESPOUSE THE QUARREL
OF THE WEAK OUT OF INBORN NOBILITY OF SPIRIT WAS NO MEAN TIMBER WHEREOF
TO CONSTRUCT A CHRISTIAN
THE MAKING HIM ONE DID NOT WARP HIS GENEROSITY
OR DIMINISH HIS COURAGE ON THE CONTRARY IT GAVE INTELLIGENT DIRECTION TO
THE ONE AND A BROADER FIELD TO THE OTHER
IF HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS PROGRESSED FASTER THAN THE OTHER CLASSES WAS
IT MATTER FOR WONDER I THINK NOT
HE TALKED TO HIS PIONEER SMALL FRY
IN A LANGUAGE THEY UNDERSTOOD IT WAS MY LARGE PRIVILEGE A MONTH BEFORE
HE DIED TO HEAR HIM TELL THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN
TO HIS CLASS WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE BOOK I LEAVE IT TO THE READER TO
FANCY WHAT IT WAS LIKE AS IT FELL RIDDLED WITH SLANG FROM THE LIPS OF
THAT GRAVE EARNEST TEACHER AND WAS LISTENED TO BY HIS LITTLE LEARNERS
WITH A CONSUMING INTEREST THAT SHOWED THAT THEY WERE AS UNCONSCIOUS AS HE
WAS THAT ANY VIOLENCE WAS BEING DONE TO THE SACRED PROPRIETIES
CHAPTER XLVIII
THE FIRST TWENTY SIX GRAVES IN THE VIRGINIA CEMETERY WERE OCCUPIED BY
MURDERED MEN
SO EVERYBODY SAID SO EVERYBODY BELIEVED AND SO THEY WILL
ALWAYS SAY AND BELIEVE
THE REASON WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH SLAUGHTERING
DONE WAS THAT IN A NEW MINING DISTRICT THE ROUGH ELEMENT PREDOMINATES
AND A PERSON IS NOT RESPECTED UNTIL HE HAS KILLED HIS MAN THAT WAS
THE VERY EXPRESSION USED
IF AN UNKNOWN INDIVIDUAL ARRIVED THEY DID NOT INQUIRE IF HE WAS CAPABLE
HONEST INDUSTRIOUS BUT HAD HE KILLED HIS MAN IF HE HAD NOT HE
GRAVITATED TO HIS NATURAL AND PROPER POSITION THAT OF A MAN OF SMALL
CONSEQUENCE IF HE HAD THE CORDIALITY OF HIS RECEPTION WAS GRADUATED
ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF HIS DEAD
IT WAS TEDIOUS WORK STRUGGLING UP
TO A POSITION OF INFLUENCE WITH BLOODLESS HANDS BUT WHEN A MAN CAME WITH
THE BLOOD OF HALF A DOZEN MEN ON HIS SOUL HIS WORTH WAS RECOGNIZED AT
ONCE AND HIS ACQUAINTANCE SOUGHT
IN NEVADA FOR A TIME THE LAWYER THE EDITOR THE BANKER THE CHIEF
DESPERADO THE CHIEF GAMBLER AND THE SALOON KEEPER OCCUPIED THE SAME
LEVEL IN SOCIETY AND IT WAS THE HIGHEST
THE CHEAPEST AND EASIEST WAY
TO BECOME AN INFLUENTIAL MAN AND BE LOOKED UP TO BY THE COMMUNITY AT
LARGE WAS TO STAND BEHIND A BAR WEAR A CLUSTER DIAMOND PIN AND SELL
WHISKY
I AM NOT SURE BUT THAT THE SALOON KEEPER HELD A SHADE HIGHER
RANK THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF SOCIETY
HIS OPINION HAD WEIGHT
IT WAS
HIS PRIVILEGE TO SAY HOW THE ELECTIONS SHOULD GO
NO GREAT MOVEMENT
COULD SUCCEED WITHOUT THE COUNTENANCE AND DIRECTION OF THE
SALOON KEEPERS
IT WAS A HIGH FAVOR WHEN THE CHIEF SALOON KEEPER
CONSENTED TO SERVE IN THE LEGISLATURE OR THE BOARD OF ALDERMEN
YOUTHFUL AMBITION HARDLY ASPIRED SO MUCH TO THE HONORS OF THE LAW OR THE
ARMY AND NAVY AS TO THE DIGNITY OF PROPRIETORSHIP IN A SALOON
TO BE A SALOON KEEPER AND KILL A MAN WAS TO BE ILLUSTRIOUS
HENCE THE
READER WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT MORE THAN ONE MAN WAS KILLED
IN NEVADA UNDER HARDLY THE PRETEXT OF PROVOCATION SO IMPATIENT WAS THE
SLAYER TO ACHIEVE REPUTATION AND THROW OFF THE GALLING SENSE OF BEING
HELD IN INDIFFERENT REPUTE BY HIS ASSOCIATES
I KNEW TWO YOUTHS WHO
TRIED TO KILL THEIR MEN FOR NO OTHER REASON AND GOT KILLED THEMSELVES
FOR THEIR PAINS
THERE GOES THE MAN THAT KILLED BILL ADAMS WAS HIGHER
PRAISE AND A SWEETER SOUND IN THE EARS OF THIS SORT OF PEOPLE THAN ANY
OTHER SPEECH THAT ADMIRING LIPS COULD UTTER
THE MEN WHO MURDERED VIRGINIA'S ORIGINAL TWENTY SIX CEMETERY OCCUPANTS
WERE NEVER PUNISHED
WHY BECAUSE ALFRED THE GREAT WHEN HE INVENTED
TRIAL BY JURY AND KNEW THAT HE HAD ADMIRABLY FRAMED IT TO SECURE JUSTICE
IN HIS AGE OF THE WORLD WAS NOT AWARE THAT IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE
CONDITION OF THINGS WOULD BE SO ENTIRELY CHANGED THAT UNLESS HE ROSE FROM
THE GRAVE AND ALTERED THE JURY PLAN TO MEET THE EMERGENCY IT WOULD PROVE
THE MOST INGENIOUS AND INFALLIBLE AGENCY FOR DEFEATING JUSTICE THAT HUMAN
WISDOM COULD CONTRIVE
FOR HOW COULD HE IMAGINE THAT WE SIMPLETONS WOULD
GO ON USING HIS JURY PLAN AFTER CIRCUMSTANCES HAD STRIPPED IT OF ITS
USEFULNESS ANY MORE THAN HE COULD IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD GO ON USING HIS
CANDLE CLOCK AFTER WE HAD INVENTED CHRONOMETERS IN HIS DAY NEWS COULD
NOT TRAVEL FAST AND HENCE HE COULD EASILY FIND A JURY OF HONEST
INTELLIGENT MEN WHO HAD NOT HEARD OF THE CASE THEY WERE CALLED TO TRY
BUT IN OUR DAY OF TELEGRAPHS AND NEWSPAPERS HIS PLAN COMPELS US TO SWEAR
IN JURIES COMPOSED OF FOOLS AND RASCALS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM RIGIDLY
EXCLUDES HONEST MEN AND MEN OF BRAINS
I REMEMBER ONE OF THOSE SORROWFUL FARCES IN VIRGINIA WHICH WE CALL A
JURY TRIAL
A NOTED DESPERADO KILLED MR
B A GOOD CITIZEN IN THE MOST
WANTON AND COLD BLOODED WAY
OF COURSE THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF IT AND
ALL MEN CAPABLE OF READING READ ABOUT IT
AND OF COURSE ALL MEN NOT
DEAF AND DUMB AND IDIOTIC TALKED ABOUT IT
A JURY LIST WAS MADE OUT
AND MR
B
L A PROMINENT BANKER AND A VALUED CITIZEN WAS QUESTIONED
PRECISELY AS HE WOULD HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED IN ANY COURT IN AMERICA
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THIS HOMICIDE
YES
HAVE YOU HELD CONVERSATIONS UPON THE SUBJECT
YES
HAVE YOU FORMED OR EXPRESSED OPINIONS ABOUT IT
YES
HAVE YOU READ THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS OF IT
YES
WE DO NOT WANT YOU
A MINISTER INTELLIGENT ESTEEMED AND GREATLY RESPECTED A MERCHANT OF
HIGH CHARACTER AND KNOWN PROBITY A MINING SUPERINTENDENT OF INTELLIGENCE
AND UNBLEMISHED REPUTATION A QUARTZ MILL OWNER OF EXCELLENT STANDING
WERE ALL QUESTIONED IN THE SAME WAY AND ALL SET ASIDE
EACH SAID THE
PUBLIC TALK AND THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS HAD NOT SO BIASED HIS MIND BUT THAT
SWORN TESTIMONY WOULD OVERTHROW HIS PREVIOUSLY FORMED OPINIONS AND ENABLE
HIM TO RENDER A VERDICT WITHOUT PREJUDICE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
FACTS
BUT OF COURSE SUCH MEN COULD NOT BE TRUSTED WITH THE CASE
IGNORAMUSES ALONE COULD METE OUT UNSULLIED JUSTICE
WHEN THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES WERE ALL EXHAUSTED A JURY OF TWELVE MEN
WAS IMPANELED A JURY WHO SWORE THEY HAD NEITHER HEARD READ TALKED
ABOUT NOR EXPRESSED AN OPINION CONCERNING A MURDER WHICH THE VERY CATTLE
IN THE CORRALS THE INDIANS IN THE SAGE BRUSH AND THE STONES IN THE
STREETS WERE COGNIZANT OF IT WAS A JURY COMPOSED OF TWO DESPERADOES
TWO LOW BEER HOUSE POLITICIANS THREE BAR KEEPERS TWO RANCHMEN WHO COULD
NOT READ AND THREE DULL STUPID HUMAN DONKEYS IT ACTUALLY CAME OUT
AFTERWARD THAT ONE OF THESE LATTER THOUGHT THAT INCEST AND ARSON WERE
THE SAME THING
THE VERDICT RENDERED BY THIS JURY WAS NOT GUILTY
WHAT ELSE COULD ONE
EXPECT
THE JURY SYSTEM PUTS A BAN UPON INTELLIGENCE AND HONESTY AND A PREMIUM
UPON IGNORANCE STUPIDITY AND PERJURY
IT IS A SHAME THAT WE MUST
CONTINUE TO USE A WORTHLESS SYSTEM BECAUSE IT WAS GOOD A THOUSAND YEARS
AGO
IN THIS AGE WHEN A GENTLEMAN OF HIGH SOCIAL STANDING INTELLIGENCE
AND PROBITY SWEARS THAT TESTIMONY GIVEN UNDER SOLEMN OATH WILL OUTWEIGH
WITH HIM STREET TALK AND NEWSPAPER REPORTS BASED UPON MERE HEARSAY HE
IS WORTH A HUNDRED JURYMEN WHO WILL SWEAR TO THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND
STUPIDITY AND JUSTICE WOULD BE FAR SAFER IN HIS HANDS THAN IN THEIRS
WHY COULD NOT THE JURY LAW BE SO ALTERED AS TO GIVE MEN OF BRAINS AND
HONESTY AND EQUAL CHANCE WITH FOOLS AND MISCREANTS IS IT RIGHT TO SHOW
THE PRESENT FAVORITISM TO ONE CLASS OF MEN AND INFLICT A DISABILITY ON
ANOTHER IN A LAND WHOSE BOAST IS THAT ALL ITS CITIZENS ARE FREE AND
EQUAL I AM A CANDIDATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE
I DESIRE TO TAMPER WITH
THE JURY LAW
I WISH TO SO ALTER IT AS TO PUT A PREMIUM ON INTELLIGENCE
AND CHARACTER AND CLOSE THE JURY BOX AGAINST IDIOTS BLACKLEGS AND
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT READ NEWSPAPERS
BUT NO DOUBT I SHALL BE DEFEATED
EVERY EFFORT I MAKE TO SAVE THE COUNTRY MISSES FIRE
MY IDEA WHEN I BEGAN THIS CHAPTER WAS TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT
DESPERADOISM IN THE FLUSH TIMES OF NEVADA
TO ATTEMPT A PORTRAYAL OF
THAT ERA AND THAT LAND AND LEAVE OUT THE BLOOD AND CARNAGE WOULD BE
LIKE PORTRAYING MORMONDOM AND LEAVING OUT POLYGAMY
THE DESPERADO
STALKED THE STREETS WITH A SWAGGER GRADED ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF HIS
HOMICIDES AND A NOD OF RECOGNITION FROM HIM WAS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE A
HUMBLE ADMIRER HAPPY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
THE DEFERENCE THAT WAS
PAID TO A DESPERADO OF WIDE REPUTATION AND WHO KEPT HIS PRIVATE
GRAVEYARD AS THE PHRASE WENT WAS MARKED AND CHEERFULLY ACCORDED
WHEN HE MOVED ALONG THE SIDEWALK IN HIS EXCESSIVELY LONG TAILED
FROCK COAT SHINY STUMP TOED BOOTS AND WITH DAINTY LITTLE SLOUCH HAT
TIPPED OVER LEFT EYE THE SMALL FRY ROUGHS MADE ROOM FOR HIS MAJESTY
WHEN HE ENTERED THE RESTAURANT THE WAITERS DESERTED BANKERS AND
MERCHANTS TO OVERWHELM HIM WITH OBSEQUIOUS SERVICE WHEN HE SHOULDERED
HIS WAY TO A BAR THE SHOULDERED PARTIES WHEELED INDIGNANTLY RECOGNIZED
HIM AND APOLOGIZED
THEY GOT A LOOK IN RETURN THAT FROZE THEIR MARROW AND BY THAT TIME A
CURLED AND BREAST PINNED BAR KEEPER WAS BEAMING OVER THE COUNTER PROUD
OF THE ESTABLISHED ACQUAINTANCESHIP THAT PERMITTED SUCH A FAMILIAR FORM
OF SPEECH AS
HOW'RE YE BILLY OLD FEL GLAD TO SEE YOU
WHAT'LL YOU TAKE THE OLD
THING
THE OLD THING MEANT HIS CUSTOMARY DRINK OF COURSE
THE BEST KNOWN NAMES IN THE TERRITORY OF NEVADA WERE THOSE BELONGING TO
THESE LONG TAILED HEROES OF THE REVOLVER
ORATORS GOVERNORS
CAPITALISTS AND LEADERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ENJOYED A DEGREE OF FAME BUT
IT SEEMED LOCAL AND MEAGRE WHEN CONTRASTED WITH THE FAME OF SUCH MEN AS
SAM BROWN JACK WILLIAMS BILLY MULLIGAN FARMER PEASE SUGARFOOT MIKE
POCK MARKED JAKE EL DORADO JOHNNY JACK MCNABB JOE MCGEE JACK HARRIS
SIX FINGERED PETE ETC ETC
THERE WAS A LONG LIST OF THEM
THEY WERE
BRAVE RECKLESS MEN AND TRAVELED WITH THEIR LIVES IN THEIR HANDS
TO
GIVE THEM THEIR DUE THEY DID THEIR KILLING PRINCIPALLY AMONG THEMSELVES
AND SELDOM MOLESTED PEACEABLE CITIZENS FOR THEY CONSIDERED IT SMALL
CREDIT TO ADD TO THEIR TROPHIES SO CHEAP A BAUBLE AS THE DEATH OF A MAN
WHO WAS NOT ON THE SHOOT AS THEY PHRASED IT
THEY KILLED EACH OTHER
ON SLIGHT PROVOCATION AND HOPED AND EXPECTED TO BE KILLED THEMSELVES
FOR THEY HELD IT ALMOST SHAME TO DIE OTHERWISE THAN WITH THEIR BOOTS
ON AS THEY EXPRESSED IT
I REMEMBER AN INSTANCE OF A DESPERADO'S CONTEMPT FOR SUCH SMALL GAME AS A
PRIVATE CITIZEN'S LIFE
I WAS TAKING A LATE SUPPER IN A RESTAURANT ONE
NIGHT WITH TWO REPORTERS AND A LITTLE PRINTER NAMED BROWN FOR
INSTANCE ANY NAME WILL DO
PRESENTLY A STRANGER WITH A LONG TAILED COAT
ON CAME IN AND NOT NOTICING BROWN'S HAT WHICH WAS LYING IN A CHAIR SAT
DOWN ON IT
LITTLE BROWN SPRANG UP AND BECAME ABUSIVE IN A MOMENT
THE
STRANGER SMILED SMOOTHED OUT THE HAT AND OFFERED IT TO BROWN WITH
PROFUSE APOLOGIES COUCHED IN CAUSTIC SARCASM AND BEGGED BROWN NOT TO
DESTROY HIM
BROWN THREW OFF HIS COAT AND CHALLENGED THE MAN TO FIGHT
ABUSED HIM THREATENED HIM IMPEACHED HIS COURAGE AND URGED AND EVEN
IMPLORED HIM TO FIGHT AND IN THE MEANTIME THE SMILING STRANGER PLACED
HIMSELF UNDER OUR PROTECTION IN MOCK DISTRESS
BUT PRESENTLY HE ASSUMED
A SERIOUS TONE AND SAID
VERY WELL GENTLEMEN IF WE MUST FIGHT WE MUST I SUPPOSE
BUT DON'T
RUSH INTO DANGER AND THEN SAY I GAVE YOU NO WARNING
I AM MORE THAN A
MATCH FOR ALL OF YOU WHEN I GET STARTED
I WILL GIVE YOU PROOFS AND
THEN IF MY FRIEND HERE STILL INSISTS I WILL TRY TO ACCOMMODATE HIM
THE TABLE WE WERE SITTING AT WAS ABOUT FIVE FEET LONG AND UNUSUALLY
CUMBERSOME AND HEAVY
HE ASKED US TO PUT OUR HANDS ON THE DISHES AND
HOLD THEM IN THEIR PLACES A MOMENT ONE OF THEM WAS A LARGE OVAL DISH
WITH A PORTLY ROAST ON IT
THEN HE SAT DOWN TILTED UP ONE END OF THE
TABLE SET TWO OF THE LEGS ON HIS KNEES TOOK THE END OF THE TABLE
BETWEEN HIS TEETH TOOK HIS HANDS AWAY AND PULLED DOWN WITH HIS TEETH
TILL THE TABLE CAME UP TO A LEVEL POSITION DISHES AND ALL HE SAID HE
COULD LIFT A KEG OF NAILS WITH HIS TEETH
HE PICKED UP A COMMON GLASS
TUMBLER AND BIT A SEMI CIRCLE OUT OF IT
THEN HE OPENED HIS BOSOM AND
SHOWED US A NET WORK OF KNIFE AND BULLET SCARS SHOWED US MORE ON HIS
ARMS AND FACE AND SAID HE BELIEVED HE HAD BULLETS ENOUGH IN HIS BODY TO
MAKE A PIG OF LEAD
HE WAS ARMED TO THE TEETH
HE CLOSED WITH THE
REMARK THAT HE WAS MR
OF CARIBOO A CELEBRATED NAME WHEREAT WE SHOOK
IN OUR SHOES
I WOULD PUBLISH THE NAME BUT FOR THE SUSPICION THAT HE
MIGHT COME AND CARVE ME
HE FINALLY INQUIRED IF BROWN STILL THIRSTED FOR
BLOOD
BROWN TURNED THE THING OVER IN HIS MIND A MOMENT AND THEN ASKED
HIM TO SUPPER
WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE READER I WILL GROUP TOGETHER IN THE NEXT
CHAPTER SOME SAMPLES OF LIFE IN OUR SMALL MOUNTAIN VILLAGE IN THE OLD
DAYS OF DESPERADOISM
I WAS THERE AT THE TIME
THE READER WILL OBSERVE
PECULIARITIES IN OUR OFFICIAL SOCIETY AND HE WILL OBSERVE ALSO AN
INSTANCE OF HOW IN NEW COUNTRIES MURDERS BREED MURDERS
CHAPTER XLIX
AN EXTRACT OR TWO FROM THE NEWSPAPERS OF THE DAY WILL FURNISH A
PHOTOGRAPH THAT CAN NEED NO EMBELLISHMENT
FATAL SHOOTING AFFRAY AN AFFRAY OCCURRED LAST EVENING IN A
BILLIARD SALOON ON C STREET BETWEEN DEPUTY MARSHAL JACK WILLIAMS
AND WM
BROWN WHICH RESULTED IN THE IMMEDIATE DEATH OF THE LATTER
THERE HAD BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY BETWEEN THE PARTIES FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS
AN INQUEST WAS IMMEDIATELY HELD AND THE FOLLOWING TESTIMONY
ADDUCED
OFFICER GEO
BIRDSALL SWORN SAYS I WAS TOLD WM
BROWN WAS DRUNK
AND WAS LOOKING FOR JACK WILLIAMS SO SOON AS I HEARD THAT I STARTED
FOR THE PARTIES TO PREVENT A COLLISION WENT INTO THE BILLIARD
SALOON SAW BILLY BROWN RUNNING AROUND SAYING IF ANYBODY HAD
ANYTHING AGAINST HIM TO SHOW CAUSE HE WAS TALKING IN A BOISTEROUS
MANNER AND OFFICER PERRY TOOK HIM TO THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM TO
TALK TO HIM BROWN CAME BACK TO ME REMARKED TO ME THAT HE THOUGHT
HE WAS AS GOOD AS ANYBODY AND KNEW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF HE
PASSED BY ME AND WENT TO THE BAR DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE DRANK OR
NOT WILLIAMS WAS AT THE END OF THE BILLIARD TABLE NEXT TO THE
STAIRWAY BROWN AFTER GOING TO THE BAR CAME BACK AND SAID HE WAS
AS GOOD AS ANY MAN IN THE WORLD HE HAD THEN WALKED OUT TO THE END
OF THE FIRST BILLIARD TABLE FROM THE BAR I MOVED CLOSER TO THEM
SUPPOSING THERE WOULD BE A FIGHT AS BROWN DREW HIS PISTOL I CAUGHT
HOLD OF IT HE HAD FIRED ONE SHOT AT WILLIAMS DON'T KNOW THE EFFECT
OF IT CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM WITH ONE HAND AND TOOK HOLD OF THE PISTOL
AND TURNED IT UP THINK HE FIRED ONCE AFTER I CAUGHT HOLD OF THE
PISTOL I WRENCHED THE PISTOL FROM HIM WALKED TO THE END OF THE
BILLIARD TABLE AND TOLD A PARTY THAT I HAD BROWN'S PISTOL AND TO
STOP SHOOTING I THINK FOUR SHOTS WERE FIRED IN ALL AFTER WALKING
OUT MR
FOSTER REMARKED THAT BROWN WAS SHOT DEAD
OH THERE WAS NO EXCITEMENT ABOUT IT HE MERELY REMARKED THE SMALL
CIRCUMSTANCE
FOUR MONTHS LATER THE FOLLOWING ITEM APPEARED IN THE SAME PAPER THE
ENTERPRISE
IN THIS ITEM THE NAME OF ONE OF THE CITY OFFICERS ABOVE
REFERRED TO DEPUTY MARSHAL JACK WILLIAMS OCCURS AGAIN
ROBBERY AND DESPERATE AFFRAY ON TUESDAY NIGHT A GERMAN NAMED
CHARLES HURTZAL ENGINEER IN A MILL AT SILVER CITY CAME TO THIS
PLACE AND VISITED THE HURDY GURDY HOUSE ON B STREET
THE MUSIC
DANCING AND TEUTONIC MAIDENS AWAKENED MEMORIES OF FADERLAND UNTIL
OUR GERMAN FRIEND WAS CARRIED AWAY WITH RAPTURE
HE EVIDENTLY HAD
MONEY AND WAS SPENDING IF FREELY
LATE IN THE EVENING JACK
WILLIAMS AND ANDY BLESSINGTON INVITED HIM DOWN STAIRS TO TAKE A CUP
OF COFFEE
WILLIAMS PROPOSED A GAME OF CARDS AND WENT UP STAIRS TO
PROCURE A DECK BUT NOT FINDING ANY RETURNED
ON THE STAIRWAY HE
MET THE GERMAN AND DRAWING HIS PISTOL KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND RIFLED
HIS POCKETS OF SOME SEVENTY DOLLARS
HURTZAL DARED GIVE NO ALARM
AS HE WAS TOLD WITH A PISTOL AT HIS HEAD IF HE MADE ANY NOISE OR
EXPOSED THEM THEY WOULD BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT
SO EFFECTUALLY WAS HE
FRIGHTENED THAT HE MADE NO COMPLAINT UNTIL HIS FRIENDS FORCED HIM
YESTERDAY A WARRANT WAS ISSUED BUT THE CULPRITS HAD DISAPPEARED
THIS EFFICIENT CITY OFFICER JACK WILLIAMS HAD THE COMMON REPUTATION OF
BEING A BURGLAR A HIGHWAYMAN AND A DESPERADO
IT WAS SAID THAT HE HAD
SEVERAL TIMES DRAWN HIS REVOLVER AND LEVIED MONEY CONTRIBUTIONS ON
CITIZENS AT DEAD OF NIGHT IN THE PUBLIC STREETS OF VIRGINIA
FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE ABOVE ITEM APPEARED WILLIAMS WAS ASSASSINATED
WHILE SITTING AT A CARD TABLE ONE NIGHT A GUN WAS THRUST THROUGH THE
CRACK OF THE DOOR AND WILLIAMS DROPPED FROM HIS CHAIR RIDDLED WITH BALLS
IT WAS SAID AT THE TIME THAT WILLIAMS HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME AWARE THAT
A PARTY OF HIS OWN SORT DESPERADOES HAD SWORN AWAY HIS LIFE AND IT WAS
GENERALLY BELIEVED AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT WILLIAMS'S FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
WOULD MAKE THE ASSASSINATION MEMORABLE AND USEFUL TOO BY A WHOLESALE
DESTRUCTION OF EACH OTHER
IT DID NOT SO HAPPEN BUT STILL TIMES WERE NOT DULL DURING THE NEXT
TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR WITHIN THAT TIME A WOMAN WAS KILLED BY A PISTOL
SHOT A MAN WAS BRAINED WITH A SLUNG SHOT AND A MAN NAMED REEDER WAS
ALSO DISPOSED OF PERMANENTLY
SOME MATTERS IN THE ENTERPRISE ACCOUNT OF
THE KILLING OF REEDER ARE WORTH NOTHING ESPECIALLY THE ACCOMMODATING
COMPLAISANCE OF A VIRGINIA JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
THE ITALICS IN THE
FOLLOWING NARRATIVE ARE MINE
MORE CUTTING AND SHOOTING THE DEVIL SEEMS TO HAVE AGAIN BROKEN
LOOSE IN OUR TOWN
PISTOLS AND GUNS EXPLODE AND KNIVES GLEAM IN OUR
STREETS AS IN EARLY TIMES
WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A LONG SEASON OF
QUIET PEOPLE ARE SLOW TO WET THEIR HANDS IN BLOOD BUT ONCE BLOOD
IS SPILLED CUTTING AND SHOOTING COME EASY
NIGHT BEFORE LAST JACK
WILLIAMS WAS ASSASSINATED AND YESTERDAY FORENOON WE HAD MORE BLOODY
WORK GROWING OUT OF THE KILLING OF WILLIAMS AND ON THE SAME STREET
IN WHICH HE MET HIS DEATH
IT APPEARS THAT TOM REEDER A FRIEND OF
WILLIAMS AND GEORGE GUMBERT WERE TALKING AT THE MEAT MARKET OF THE
LATTER ABOUT THE KILLING OF WILLIAMS THE PREVIOUS NIGHT WHEN
REEDER SAID IT WAS A MOST COWARDLY ACT TO SHOOT A MAN IN SUCH A WAY
GIVING HIM NO SHOW GUMBERT SAID THAT WILLIAMS HAD AS GOOD A
SHOW AS HE GAVE BILLY BROWN MEANING THE MAN KILLED BY WILLIAMS
LAST MARCH
REEDER SAID IT WAS A D D LIE THAT WILLIAMS HAD NO
SHOW AT ALL
AT THIS GUMBERT DREW A KNIFE AND STABBED REEDER
CUTTING HIM IN TWO PLACES IN THE BACK
ONE STROKE OF THE KNIFE CUT
INTO THE SLEEVE OF REEDER'S COAT AND PASSED DOWNWARD IN A SLANTING
DIRECTION THROUGH HIS CLOTHING AND ENTERED HIS BODY AT THE SMALL OF
THE BACK ANOTHER BLOW STRUCK MORE SQUARELY AND MADE A MUCH MORE
DANGEROUS WOUND
GUMBERT GAVE HIMSELF UP TO THE OFFICERS OF
JUSTICE AND WAS SHORTLY AFTER DISCHARGED BY JUSTICE ATWILL ON HIS
OWN RECOGNIZANCE TO APPEAR FOR TRIAL AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING
IN THE MEANTIME REEDER HAD BEEN TAKEN INTO THE OFFICE OF DR
OWENS
WHERE HIS WOUNDS WERE PROPERLY DRESSED
ONE OF HIS WOUNDS WAS
CONSIDERED QUITE DANGEROUS AND IT WAS THOUGHT BY MANY THAT IT WOULD
PROVE FATAL
BUT BEING CONSIDERABLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR
REEDER DID NOT FEEL HIS WOUNDS AS HE OTHERWISE WOULD AND HE GOT UP
AND WENT INTO THE STREET
HE WENT TO THE MEAT MARKET AND RENEWED
HIS QUARREL WITH GUMBERT THREATENING HIS LIFE
FRIENDS TRIED TO
INTERFERE TO PUT A STOP TO THE QUARREL AND GET THE PARTIES AWAY FROM
EACH OTHER
IN THE FASHION SALOON REEDER MADE THREATS AGAINST THE
LIFE OF GUMBERT SAYING HE WOULD KILL HIM AND IT IS SAID THAT HE
REQUESTED THE OFFICERS NOT TO ARREST GUMBERT AS HE INTENDED TO KILL
HIM
AFTER THESE THREATS GUMBERT WENT OFF AND PROCURED A
DOUBLE BARRELED SHOT GUN LOADED WITH BUCK SHOT OR REVOLVER BALLS
AND WENT AFTER REEDER
TWO OR THREE PERSONS WERE ASSISTING HIM ALONG
THE STREET TRYING TO GET HIM HOME AND HAD HIM JUST IN FRONT OF THE
STORE OF KLOPSTOCK HARRIS WHEN GUMBERT CAME ACROSS TOWARD HIM
FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET WITH HIS GUN
HE CAME UP
WITHIN ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET OF REEDER AND CALLED OUT TO THOSE
WITH HIM TO LOOK OUT GET OUT OF THE WAY AND THEY HAD ONLY TIME
TO HEED THE WARNING WHEN HE FIRED
REEDER WAS AT THE TIME
ATTEMPTING TO SCREEN HIMSELF BEHIND A LARGE CASK WHICH STOOD
AGAINST THE AWNING POST OF KLOPSTOCK HARRIS'S STORE BUT SOME OF
THE BALLS TOOK EFFECT IN THE LOWER PART OF HIS BREAST AND HE REELED
AROUND FORWARD AND FELL IN FRONT OF THE CASK
GUMBERT THEN RAISED
HIS GUN AND FIRED THE SECOND BARREL WHICH MISSED REEDER AND ENTERED
THE GROUND
AT THE TIME THAT THIS OCCURRED THERE WERE A GREAT MANY
PERSONS ON THE STREET IN THE VICINITY AND A NUMBER OF THEM CALLED
OUT TO GUMBERT WHEN THEY SAW HIM RAISE HIS GUN TO HOLD ON AND
DON'T SHOOT THE CUTTING TOOK PLACE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE
SHOOTING ABOUT TWELVE
AFTER THE SHOOTING THE STREET WAS INSTANTLY
CROWDED WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THAT PART OF THE TOWN SOME
APPEARING MUCH EXCITED AND LAUGHING DECLARING THAT IT LOOKED LIKE
THE GOOD OLD TIMES OF '60 MARSHAL PERRY AND OFFICER BIRDSALL
WERE NEAR WHEN THE SHOOTING OCCURRED AND GUMBERT WAS IMMEDIATELY
ARRESTED AND HIS GUN TAKEN FROM HIM WHEN HE WAS MARCHED OFF TO
JAIL
MANY PERSONS WHO WERE ATTRACTED TO THE SPOT WHERE THIS BLOODY
WORK HAD JUST TAKEN PLACE LOOKED BEWILDERED AND SEEMED TO BE ASKING
THEMSELVES WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN NEXT APPEARING IN DOUBT AS TO WHETHER
THE KILLING MANIA HAD REACHED ITS CLIMAX OR WHETHER WE WERE TO TURN
IN AND HAVE A GRAND KILLING SPELL SHOOTING WHOEVER MIGHT HAVE GIVEN
US OFFENCE
IT WAS WHISPERED AROUND THAT IT WAS NOT ALL OVER YET
FIVE OR SIX MORE WERE TO BE KILLED BEFORE NIGHT
REEDER WAS TAKEN
TO THE VIRGINIA CITY HOTEL AND DOCTORS CALLED IN TO EXAMINE HIS
WOUNDS
THEY FOUND THAT TWO OR THREE BALLS HAD ENTERED HIS RIGHT
SIDE ONE OF THEM APPEARED TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE SUBSTANCE OF
THE LUNGS WHILE ANOTHER PASSED INTO THE LIVER
TWO BALLS WERE ALSO
FOUND TO HAVE STRUCK ONE OF HIS LEGS
AS SOME OF THE BALLS STRUCK
THE CASK THE WOUNDS IN REEDER'S LEG WERE PROBABLY FROM THESE
GLANCING DOWNWARDS THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SECOND
SHOT FIRED
AFTER BEING SHOT REEDER SAID WHEN HE GOT ON HIS FEET
SMILING AS HE SPOKE IT WILL TAKE BETTER SHOOTING THAN THAT TO
KILL ME THE DOCTORS CONSIDER IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO
RECOVER BUT AS HE HAS AN EXCELLENT CONSTITUTION HE MAY SURVIVE
NOTWITHSTANDING THE NUMBER AND DANGEROUS CHARACTER OF THE WOUNDS HE
HAS RECEIVED
THE TOWN APPEARS TO BE PERFECTLY QUIET AT PRESENT AS
THOUGH THE LATE STORMY TIMES HAD CLEARED OUR MORAL ATMOSPHERE BUT
WHO CAN TELL IN WHAT QUARTER CLOUDS ARE LOWERING OR PLOTS RIPENING
REEDER OR AT LEAST WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM SURVIVED HIS WOUNDS TWO DAYS
NOTHING WAS EVER DONE WITH GUMBERT
TRIAL BY JURY IS THE PALLADIUM OF OUR LIBERTIES
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT A
PALLADIUM IS HAVING NEVER SEEN A PALLADIUM BUT IT IS A GOOD THING NO
DOUBT AT ANY RATE
NOT LESS THAN A HUNDRED MEN HAVE BEEN MURDERED IN
NEVADA PERHAPS I WOULD BE WITHIN BOUNDS IF I SAID THREE HUNDRED AND AS
FAR AS I CAN LEARN ONLY TWO PERSONS HAVE SUFFERED THE DEATH PENALTY
THERE
HOWEVER FOUR OR FIVE WHO HAD NO MONEY AND NO POLITICAL INFLUENCE
HAVE BEEN PUNISHED BY IMPRISONMENT ONE LANGUISHED IN PRISON AS MUCH AS
EIGHT MONTHS I THINK
HOWEVER I DO NOT DESIRE TO BE EXTRAVAGANT IT
MAY HAVE BEEN LESS
HOWEVER ONE PROPHECY WAS VERIFIED AT ANY RATE
IT WAS ASSERTED BY THE
DESPERADOES THAT ONE OF THEIR BRETHREN JOE MCGEE A SPECIAL POLICEMAN
WAS KNOWN TO BE THE CONSPIRATOR CHOSEN BY LOT TO ASSASSINATE WILLIAMS
AND THEY ALSO ASSERTED THAT DOOM HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AGAINST MCGEE AND
THAT HE WOULD BE ASSASSINATED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER THAT HAD BEEN
ADOPTED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF WILLIAMS A PROPHECY WHICH CAME TRUE A
YEAR LATER
AFTER TWELVE MONTHS OF DISTRESS FOR MCGEE SAW A FANCIED
ASSASSIN IN EVERY MAN THAT APPROACHED HIM HE MADE THE LAST OF MANY
EFFORTS TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY UNWATCHED
HE WENT TO CARSON AND SAT
DOWN IN A SALOON TO WAIT FOR THE STAGE IT WOULD LEAVE AT FOUR IN THE
MORNING
BUT AS THE NIGHT WANED AND THE CROWD THINNED HE GREW UNEASY
AND TOLD THE BAR KEEPER THAT ASSASSINS WERE ON HIS TRACK
THE BAR KEEPER
TOLD HIM TO STAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THEN AND NOT GO NEAR THE
DOOR OR THE WINDOW BY THE STOVE
BUT A FATAL FASCINATION SEDUCED HIM TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE STOVE EVERY NOW AND THEN AND REPEATEDLY THE
BAR KEEPER BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND WARNED HIM TO
REMAIN THERE
BUT HE COULD NOT
AT THREE IN THE MORNING HE AGAIN
RETURNED TO THE STOVE AND SAT DOWN BY A STRANGER
BEFORE THE BAR KEEPER
COULD GET TO HIM WITH ANOTHER WARNING WHISPER SOME ONE OUTSIDE FIRED
THROUGH THE WINDOW AND RIDDLED MCGEE'S BREAST WITH SLUGS KILLING HIM
ALMOST INSTANTLY
BY THE SAME DISCHARGE THE STRANGER AT MCGEE'S SIDE
ALSO RECEIVED ATTENTIONS WHICH PROVED FATAL IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR THREE
DAYS
CHAPTER L
THESE MURDER AND JURY STATISTICS REMIND ME OF A CERTAIN VERY
EXTRAORDINARY TRIAL AND EXECUTION OF TWENTY YEARS AGO IT IS A SCRAP OF
HISTORY FAMILIAR TO ALL OLD CALIFORNIANS AND WORTHY TO BE KNOWN BY OTHER
PEOPLES OF THE EARTH THAT LOVE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD JUSTICE
UNENCUMBERED WITH NONSENSE
I WOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THIS DIGRESSION BUT
FOR THE FACT THAT THE INFORMATION I AM ABOUT TO OFFER IS APOLOGY ENOUGH
IN ITSELF
AND SINCE I DIGRESS CONSTANTLY ANYHOW PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL
TO ESCHEW APOLOGIES ALTOGETHER AND THUS PREVENT THEIR GROWING IRKSOME
CAPT
NED BLAKELY THAT NAME WILL ANSWER AS WELL AS ANY OTHER FICTITIOUS
ONE FOR HE WAS STILL WITH THE LIVING AT LAST ACCOUNTS AND MAY NOT
DESIRE TO BE FAMOUS SAILED SHIPS OUT OF THE HARBOR OF SAN FRANCISCO FOR
MANY YEARS
HE WAS A STALWART WARM HEARTED EAGLE EYED VETERAN WHO HAD
BEEN A SAILOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS A SAILOR FROM EARLY BOYHOOD
HE WAS A
ROUGH HONEST CREATURE FULL OF PLUCK AND JUST AS FULL OF HARD HEADED
SIMPLICITY TOO
HE HATED TRIFLING CONVENTIONALITIES BUSINESS WAS THE
WORD WITH HIM
HE HAD ALL A SAILOR'S VINDICTIVENESS AGAINST THE QUIPS
AND QUIRKS OF THE LAW AND STEADFASTLY BELIEVED THAT THE FIRST AND LAST
AIM AND OBJECT OF THE LAW AND LAWYERS WAS TO DEFEAT JUSTICE
HE SAILED FOR THE CHINCHA ISLANDS IN COMMAND OF A GUANO SHIP
HE HAD A
FINE CREW BUT HIS NEGRO MATE WAS HIS PET ON HIM HE HAD FOR YEARS
LAVISHED HIS ADMIRATION AND ESTEEM
IT WAS CAPT
NED'S FIRST VOYAGE TO
THE CHINCHAS BUT HIS FAME HAD GONE BEFORE HIM THE FAME OF BEING A MAN
WHO WOULD FIGHT AT THE DROPPING OF A HANDKERCHIEF WHEN IMPOSED UPON AND
WOULD STAND NO NONSENSE
IT WAS A FAME WELL EARNED
ARRIVED IN THE
ISLANDS HE FOUND THAT THE STAPLE OF CONVERSATION WAS THE EXPLOITS OF ONE
BILL NOAKES A BULLY THE MATE OF A TRADING SHIP
THIS MAN HAD CREATED A
SMALL REIGN OF TERROR THERE
AT NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT CAPT

PULP AND THEN THREW HIM OVERBOARD

ANY MAN THAT INTRUDED THERE
THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT MADE TO FOLLOW THE
VILLAINS THERE WAS NO DISPOSITION TO DO IT AND INDEED VERY LITTLE
THOUGHT OF SUCH AN ENTERPRISE
THERE WERE NO COURTS AND NO OFFICERS
THERE WAS NO GOVERNMENT THE ISLANDS BELONGED TO PERU AND PERU WAS FAR

ANY OTHER NATION
HOWEVER CAPT
NED WAS NOT PERPLEXING HIS HEAD ABOUT SUCH THINGS

EARLY IN THE MORNING CAPT
NED CALLED IN ALL THE SEA CAPTAINS IN
THE HARBOR AND INVITED THEM WITH NAUTICAL CEREMONY TO BE PRESENT ON
BOARD HIS SHIP AT NINE O'CLOCK TO WITNESS THE HANGING OF NOAKES AT THE
YARD ARM
WHAT THE MAN HAS NOT BEEN TRIED
OF COURSE HE HASN'T
BUT DIDN'T HE KILL THE NIGGER

EVERYBODY I'VE TALKED TO TALKS
JUST THE SAME WAY YOU DO
EVERYBODY SAYS HE KILLED THE NIGGER EVERYBODY
KNOWS HE KILLED THE NIGGER AND YET EVERY LUBBER OF YOU WANTS HIM TRIED
FOR IT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND SUCH BLOODY FOOLISHNESS AS THAT
TRIED
MIND YOU I DON'T OBJECT TO TRYING HIM IF IT'S GOT TO BE DONE TO GIVE
SATISFACTION AND I'LL BE THERE AND CHIP IN AND HELP TOO BUT PUT IT

HE KILLED THE NIGGER
SAY I MUST BE GOING
IF YOUR MATE WOULD
LIKE TO COME TO THE HANGING FETCH HIM ALONG
I LIKE HIM
THERE WAS A STIR IN THE CAMP
THE CAPTAINS CAME IN A BODY AND PLEADED
WITH CAPT
NED NOT TO DO THIS RASH THING
THEY PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD
CREATE A COURT COMPOSED OF CAPTAINS OF THE BEST CHARACTER THEY WOULD
EMPANEL A JURY THEY WOULD CONDUCT EVERYTHING IN A WAY BECOMING THE
SERIOUS NATURE OF THE BUSINESS IN HAND AND GIVE THE CASE AN IMPARTIAL
HEARING AND THE ACCUSED A FAIR TRIAL
AND THEY SAID IT WOULD BE MURDER
AND PUNISHABLE BY THE AMERICAN COURTS IF HE PERSISTED AND HUNG THE
ACCUSED ON HIS SHIP
THEY PLEADED HARD
CAPT
NED SAID
GENTLEMEN I'M NOT STUBBORN AND I'M NOT UNREASONABLE
I'M ALWAYS
WILLING TO DO JUST AS NEAR RIGHT AS I CAN
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
PROBABLY ONLY A LITTLE WHILE
AND CAN I TAKE HIM UP THE SHORE AND HANG HIM AS SOON AS YOU ARE DONE
IF HE IS PROVEN GUILTY HE SHALL BE HANGED WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DELAY
IF HE'S PROVEN GUILTY
GREAT NEPTUNE AIN'T HE GUILTY THIS BEATS MY
TIME
WHY YOU ALL KNOW HE'S GUILTY
BUT AT LAST THEY SATISFIED HIM THAT THEY WERE PROJECTING NOTHING
UNDERHANDED
THEN HE SAID
WELL ALL RIGHT
YOU GO ON AND TRY HIM AND I'LL GO DOWN AND OVERHAUL
HIS CONSCIENCE AND PREPARE HIM TO GO LIKE ENOUGH HE NEEDS IT AND I
DON'T WANT TO SEND HIM OFF WITHOUT A SHOW FOR HEREAFTER
THIS WAS ANOTHER OBSTACLE
THEY FINALLY CONVINCED HIM THAT IT WAS
NECESSARY TO HAVE THE ACCUSED IN COURT
THEN THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND A
GUARD TO BRING HIM
NO SIR I PREFER TO FETCH HIM MYSELF HE DON'T GET OUT OF MY HANDS
BESIDES I'VE GOT TO GO TO THE SHIP TO GET A ROPE ANYWAY
THE COURT ASSEMBLED WITH DUE CEREMONY EMPANELED A JURY AND PRESENTLY
CAPT
NED ENTERED LEADING THE PRISONER WITH ONE HAND AND CARRYING A
BIBLE AND A ROPE IN THE OTHER
HE SEATED HIMSELF BY THE SIDE OF HIS
CAPTIVE AND TOLD THE COURT TO UP ANCHOR AND MAKE SAIL THEN HE TURNED
A SEARCHING EYE ON THE JURY AND DETECTED NOAKES'S FRIENDS THE TWO
BULLIES
HE STRODE OVER AND SAID TO THEM CONFIDENTIALLY
YOU'RE HERE TO INTERFERE YOU SEE
NOW YOU VOTE RIGHT DO YOU HEAR OR
ELSE THERE'LL BE A DOUBLE BARRELED INQUEST HERE WHEN THIS TRIAL'S OFF
AND YOUR REMAINDERS WILL GO HOME IN A COUPLE OF BASKETS
THE CAUTION WAS NOT WITHOUT FRUIT
THE JURY WAS A UNIT THE VERDICT
GUILTY
CAPT
NED SPRUNG TO HIS FEET AND SAID
COME ALONG YOU'RE MY MEAT NOW MY LAD ANYWAY
GENTLEMEN YOU'VE DONE
YOURSELVES PROUD
I INVITE YOU ALL TO COME AND SEE THAT I DO IT ALL
STRAIGHT
FOLLOW ME TO THE CANYON A MILE ABOVE HERE
THE COURT INFORMED HIM THAT A SHERIFF HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO DO THE
HANGING AND
CAPT
NED'S PATIENCE WAS AT AN END
HIS WRATH WAS BOUNDLESS
THE
SUBJECT OF A SHERIFF WAS JUDICIOUSLY DROPPED
WHEN THE CROWD ARRIVED AT THE CANYON CAPT
NED CLIMBED A TREE AND
ARRANGED THE HALTER THEN CAME DOWN AND NOOSED HIS MAN
HE OPENED HIS
BIBLE AND LAID ASIDE HIS HAT
SELECTING A CHAPTER AT RANDOM HE READ IT
THROUGH IN A DEEP BASS VOICE AND WITH SINCERE SOLEMNITY
THEN HE SAID
LAD YOU ARE ABOUT TO GO ALOFT AND GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOURSELF AND THE
LIGHTER A MAN'S MANIFEST IS AS FAR AS SIN'S CONCERNED THE BETTER FOR
HIM
MAKE A CLEAN BREAST MAN AND CARRY A LOG WITH YOU THAT'LL BEAR
INSPECTION
YOU KILLED THE NIGGER
NO REPLY
A LONG PAUSE
THE CAPTAIN READ ANOTHER CHAPTER PAUSING FROM TIME TO TIME TO IMPRESS
THE EFFECT
THEN HE TALKED AN EARNEST PERSUASIVE SERMON TO HIM AND
ENDED BY REPEATING THE QUESTION
DID YOU KILL THE NIGGER
NO REPLY OTHER THAN A MALIGNANT SCOWL
THE CAPTAIN NOW READ THE FIRST
AND SECOND CHAPTERS OF GENESIS WITH DEEP FEELING PAUSED A MOMENT
CLOSED THE BOOK REVERENTLY AND SAID WITH A PERCEPTIBLE SAVOR OF
SATISFACTION
THERE
FOUR CHAPTERS
THERE'S FEW THAT WOULD HAVE TOOK THE PAINS WITH
YOU THAT I HAVE
THEN HE SWUNG UP THE CONDEMNED AND MADE THE ROPE FAST STOOD BY AND
TIMED HIM HALF AN HOUR WITH HIS WATCH AND THEN DELIVERED THE BODY TO THE
COURT
A LITTLE AFTER AS HE STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE MOTIONLESS FIGURE
A DOUBT CAME INTO HIS FACE EVIDENTLY HE FELT A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE A
MISGIVING AND HE SAID WITH A SIGH
WELL P'RAPS I OUGHT TO BURNT HIM MAYBE
BUT I WAS TRYING TO DO FOR
THE BEST
WHEN THE HISTORY OF THIS AFFAIR REACHED CALIFORNIA IT WAS IN THE EARLY
DAYS IT MADE A DEAL OF TALK BUT DID NOT DIMINISH THE CAPTAIN'S
POPULARITY IN ANY DEGREE
IT INCREASED IT INDEED
CALIFORNIA HAD A
POPULATION THEN THAT INFLICTED JUSTICE AFTER A FASHION THAT WAS
SIMPLICITY AND PRIMITIVENESS ITSELF AND COULD THEREFORE ADMIRE
APPRECIATIVELY WHEN THE SAME FASHION WAS FOLLOWED ELSEWHERE
CHAPTER LI
VICE FLOURISHED LUXURIANTLY DURING THE HEY DAY OF OUR FLUSH TIMES THE
SALOONS WERE OVERBURDENED WITH CUSTOM SO WERE THE POLICE COURTS THE
GAMBLING DENS THE BROTHELS AND THE JAILS UNFAILING SIGNS OF HIGH
PROSPERITY IN A MINING REGION IN ANY REGION FOR THAT MATTER
IS IT NOT
SO A CROWDED POLICE COURT DOCKET IS THE SUREST OF ALL SIGNS THAT TRADE
IS BRISK AND MONEY PLENTY
STILL THERE IS ONE OTHER SIGN IT COMES
LAST BUT WHEN IT DOES COME IT ESTABLISHES BEYOND CAVIL THAT THE FLUSH
TIMES ARE AT THE FLOOD
THIS IS THE BIRTH OF THE LITERARY PAPER
THE WEEKLY OCCIDENTAL DEVOTED TO LITERATURE MADE ITS APPEARANCE IN
VIRGINIA
ALL THE LITERARY PEOPLE WERE ENGAGED TO WRITE FOR IT
MR
F
WAS TO EDIT IT
HE WAS A FELICITOUS SKIRMISHER WITH A PEN AND A MAN WHO
COULD SAY HAPPY THINGS IN A CRISP NEAT WAY
ONCE WHILE EDITOR OF THE
UNION HE HAD DISPOSED OF A LABORED INCOHERENT TWO COLUMN ATTACK MADE
UPON HIM BY A CONTEMPORARY WITH A SINGLE LINE WHICH AT FIRST GLANCE
SEEMED TO CONTAIN A SOLEMN AND TREMENDOUS COMPLIMENT VIZ THE LOGIC OF
OUR ADVERSARY RESEMBLES THE PEACE OF GOD AND LEFT IT TO THE READER'S
MEMORY AND AFTER THOUGHT TO INVEST THE REMARK WITH ANOTHER AND MORE
DIFFERENT MEANING BY SUPPLYING FOR HIMSELF AND AT HIS OWN LEISURE THE
REST OF THE SCRIPTURE IN THAT IT PASSETH UNDERSTANDING HE ONCE SAID
OF A LITTLE HALF STARVED WAYSIDE COMMUNITY THAT HAD NO SUBSISTENCE
EXCEPT WHAT THEY COULD GET BY PREYING UPON CHANCE PASSENGERS WHO STOPPED
OVER WITH THEM A DAY WHEN TRAVELING BY THE OVERLAND STAGE THAT IN THEIR
CHURCH SERVICE THEY HAD ALTERED THE LORD'S PRAYER TO READ GIVE US THIS
DAY OUR DAILY STRANGER
WE EXPECTED GREAT THINGS OF THE OCCIDENTAL
OF COURSE IT COULD NOT GET
ALONG WITHOUT AN ORIGINAL NOVEL AND SO WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HURL INTO
THE WORK THE FULL STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY
MRS
F
WAS AN ABLE ROMANCIST
OF THE INEFFABLE SCHOOL I KNOW NO OTHER NAME TO APPLY TO A SCHOOL WHOSE
HEROES ARE ALL DAINTY AND ALL PERFECT
SHE WROTE THE OPENING CHAPTER
AND INTRODUCED A LOVELY BLONDE SIMPLETON WHO TALKED NOTHING BUT PEARLS
AND POETRY AND WHO WAS VIRTUOUS TO THE VERGE OF ECCENTRICITY
SHE ALSO
INTRODUCED A YOUNG FRENCH DUKE OF AGGRAVATED REFINEMENT IN LOVE WITH THE
BLONDE
MR
F
FOLLOWED NEXT WEEK WITH A BRILLIANT LAWYER WHO SET ABOUT
GETTING THE DUKE'S ESTATES INTO TROUBLE AND A SPARKLING YOUNG LADY OF
HIGH SOCIETY WHO FELL TO FASCINATING THE DUKE AND IMPAIRING THE APPETITE
OF THE BLONDE
MR
D A DARK AND BLOODY EDITOR OF ONE OF THE DAILIES
FOLLOWED MR
F THE THIRD WEEK INTRODUCING A MYSTERIOUS ROSCICRUCIAN
WHO TRANSMUTED METALS HELD CONSULTATIONS WITH THE DEVIL IN A CAVE AT
DEAD OF NIGHT AND CAST THE HOROSCOPE OF THE SEVERAL HEROES AND HEROINES
IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PROVIDE PLENTY OF TROUBLE FOR THEIR FUTURE CAREERS
AND BREED A SOLEMN AND AWFUL PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE NOVEL
HE ALSO
INTRODUCED A CLOAKED AND MASKED MELODRAMATIC MISCREANT PUT HIM ON A
SALARY AND SET HIM ON THE MIDNIGHT TRACK OF THE DUKE WITH A POISONED
DAGGER
HE ALSO CREATED AN IRISH COACHMAN WITH A RICH BROGUE AND PLACED
HIM IN THE SERVICE OF THE SOCIETY YOUNG LADY WITH AN ULTERIOR MISSION TO
CARRY BILLET DOUX TO THE DUKE
ABOUT THIS TIME THERE ARRIVED IN VIRGINIA A DISSOLUTE STRANGER WITH A
LITERARY TURN OF MIND RATHER SEEDY HE WAS BUT VERY QUIET AND
UNASSUMING ALMOST DIFFIDENT INDEED
HE WAS SO GENTLE AND HIS MANNERS
WERE SO PLEASING AND KINDLY WHETHER HE WAS SOBER OR INTOXICATED THAT HE
MADE FRIENDS OF ALL WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH HIM
HE APPLIED FOR
LITERARY WORK OFFERED CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT HE WIELDED AN EASY AND
PRACTICED PEN AND SO MR
F
ENGAGED HIM AT ONCE TO HELP WRITE THE NOVEL
HIS CHAPTER WAS TO FOLLOW MR
D 'S AND MINE WAS TO COME NEXT
NOW WHAT
DOES THIS FELLOW DO BUT GO OFF AND GET DRUNK AND THEN PROCEED TO HIS
QUARTERS AND SET TO WORK WITH HIS IMAGINATION IN A STATE OF CHAOS AND
THAT CHAOS IN A CONDITION OF EXTRAVAGANT ACTIVITY
THE RESULT MAY BE
GUESSED
HE SCANNED THE CHAPTERS OF HIS PREDECESSORS FOUND PLENTY OF
HEROES AND HEROINES ALREADY CREATED AND WAS SATISFIED WITH THEM HE
DECIDED TO INTRODUCE NO MORE WITH ALL THE CONFIDENCE THAT WHISKY
INSPIRES AND ALL THE EASY COMPLACENCY IT GIVES TO ITS SERVANT HE THEN
LAUNCHED HIMSELF LOVINGLY INTO HIS WORK HE MARRIED THE COACHMAN TO THE
SOCIETY YOUNG LADY FOR THE SAKE OF THE SCANDAL MARRIED THE DUKE TO THE
BLONDE'S STEPMOTHER FOR THE SAKE OF THE SENSATION STOPPED THE
DESPERADO'S SALARY CREATED A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE DEVIL AND THE
ROSCICRUCIAN THREW THE DUKE'S PROPERTY INTO THE WICKED LAWYER'S HANDS
MADE THE LAWYER'S UPBRAIDING CONSCIENCE DRIVE HIM TO DRINK THENCE TO
DELIRIUM TREMENS THENCE TO SUICIDE BROKE THE COACHMAN'S NECK LET HIS
WIDOW SUCCUMB TO CONTUMELY NEGLECT POVERTY AND CONSUMPTION CAUSED THE
BLONDE TO DROWN HERSELF LEAVING HER CLOTHES ON THE BANK WITH THE
CUSTOMARY NOTE PINNED TO THEM FORGIVING THE DUKE AND HOPING HE WOULD BE
HAPPY REVEALED TO THE DUKE BY MEANS OF THE USUAL STRAWBERRY MARK ON
LEFT ARM THAT HE HAD MARRIED HIS OWN LONG LOST MOTHER AND DESTROYED HIS
LONG LOST SISTER INSTITUTED THE PROPER AND NECESSARY SUICIDE OF THE DUKE
AND THE DUCHESS IN ORDER TO COMPASS POETICAL JUSTICE OPENED THE EARTH
AND LET THE ROSCICRUCIAN THROUGH ACCOMPANIED WITH THE ACCUSTOMED SMOKE
AND THUNDER AND SMELL OF BRIMSTONE AND FINISHED WITH THE PROMISE THAT IN
THE NEXT CHAPTER AFTER HOLDING A GENERAL INQUEST HE WOULD TAKE UP THE
SURVIVING CHARACTER OF THE NOVEL AND TELL WHAT BECAME OF THE DEVIL
IT READ WITH SINGULAR SMOOTHNESS AND WITH A DEAD EARNESTNESS THAT WAS
FUNNY ENOUGH TO SUFFOCATE A BODY
BUT THERE WAS WAR WHEN IT CAME IN
THE OTHER NOVELISTS WERE FURIOUS
THE MILD STRANGER NOT YET MORE THAN
HALF SOBER STOOD THERE UNDER A SCATHING FIRE OF VITUPERATION MEEK AND
BEWILDERED LOOKING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER OF HIS ASSAILANTS AND WONDERING
WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO INVOKE SUCH A STORM
WHEN A LULL CAME AT
LAST HE SAID HIS SAY GENTLY AND APPEALINGLY SAID HE DID NOT RIGHTLY
REMEMBER WHAT HE HAD WRITTEN BUT WAS SURE HE HAD TRIED TO DO THE BEST HE
COULD AND KNEW HIS OBJECT HAD BEEN TO MAKE THE NOVEL NOT ONLY PLEASANT
AND PLAUSIBLE BUT INSTRUCTIVE AND
THE BOMBARDMENT BEGAN AGAIN
THE NOVELISTS ASSAILED HIS ILL CHOSEN
ADJECTIVES AND DEMOLISHED THEM WITH A STORM OF DENUNCIATION AND RIDICULE
AND SO THE SIEGE WENT ON
EVERY TIME THE STRANGER TRIED TO APPEASE THE
ENEMY HE ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE
FINALLY HE OFFERED TO REWRITE THE
CHAPTER
THIS ARRESTED HOSTILITIES
THE INDIGNATION GRADUALLY QUIETED
DOWN PEACE REIGNED AGAIN AND THE SUFFERER RETIRED IN SAFETY AND GOT HIM
TO HIS OWN CITADEL
BUT ON THE WAY THITHER THE EVIL ANGEL TEMPTED HIM AND HE GOT DRUNK AGAIN
AND AGAIN HIS IMAGINATION WENT MAD
HE LED THE HEROES AND HEROINES A
WILDER DANCE THAN EVER AND YET ALL THROUGH IT RAN THAT SAME CONVINCING
AIR OF HONESTY AND EARNESTNESS THAT HAD MARKED HIS FIRST WORK
HE GOT
THE CHARACTERS INTO THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS PUT THEM THROUGH
THE MOST SURPRISING PERFORMANCES AND MADE THEM TALK THE STRANGEST TALK
BUT THE CHAPTER CANNOT BE DESCRIBED
IT WAS SYMMETRICALLY CRAZY IT WAS
ARTISTICALLY ABSURD AND IT HAD EXPLANATORY FOOTNOTES THAT WERE FULLY AS
CURIOUS AS THE TEXT
I REMEMBER ONE OF THE SITUATIONS AND WILL OFFER
IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WHOLE
HE ALTERED THE CHARACTER OF THE BRILLIANT
LAWYER AND MADE HIM A GREAT HEARTED SPLENDID FELLOW GAVE HIM FAME AND
RICHES AND SET HIS AGE AT THIRTY THREE YEARS
THEN HE MADE THE BLONDE
DISCOVER THROUGH THE HELP OF THE ROSCICRUCIAN AND THE MELODRAMATIC
MISCREANT THAT WHILE THE DUKE LOVED HER MONEY ARDENTLY AND WANTED IT HE
SECRETLY FELT A SORT OF LEANING TOWARD THE SOCIETY YOUNG LADY
STUNG TO
THE QUICK SHE TORE HER AFFECTIONS FROM HIM AND BESTOWED THEM WITH
TENFOLD POWER UPON THE LAWYER WHO RESPONDED WITH CONSUMING ZEAL
BUT
THE PARENTS WOULD NONE OF IT
WHAT THEY WANTED IN THE FAMILY WAS A DUKE
AND A DUKE THEY WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE THOUGH THEY CONFESSED THAT NEXT
TO THE DUKE THE LAWYER HAD THEIR PREFERENCE
NECESSARILY THE BLONDE NOW
WENT INTO A DECLINE
THE PARENTS WERE ALARMED
THEY PLEADED WITH HER TO
MARRY THE DUKE BUT SHE STEADFASTLY REFUSED AND PINED ON
THEN THEY
LAID A PLAN
THEY TOLD HER TO WAIT A YEAR AND A DAY AND IF AT THE END
OF THAT TIME SHE STILL FELT THAT SHE COULD NOT MARRY THE DUKE SHE MIGHT
MARRY THE LAWYER WITH THEIR FULL CONSENT
THE RESULT WAS AS THEY HAD
FORESEEN GLADNESS CAME AGAIN AND THE FLUSH OF RETURNING HEALTH
THEN
THE PARENTS TOOK THE NEXT STEP IN THEIR SCHEME
THEY HAD THE FAMILY
PHYSICIAN RECOMMEND A LONG SEA VOYAGE AND MUCH LAND TRAVEL FOR THE
THOROUGH RESTORATION OF THE BLONDE'S STRENGTH AND THEY INVITED THE DUKE
TO BE OF THE PARTY
THEY JUDGED THAT THE DUKE'S CONSTANT PRESENCE AND
THE LAWYER'S PROTRACTED ABSENCE WOULD DO THE REST FOR THEY DID NOT
INVITE THE LAWYER
SO THEY SET SAIL IN A STEAMER FOR AMERICA AND THE THIRD DAY OUT WHEN
THEIR SEA SICKNESS CALLED TRUCE AND PERMITTED THEM TO TAKE THEIR FIRST
MEAL AT THE PUBLIC TABLE BEHOLD THERE SAT THE LAWYER THE DUKE AND
PARTY MADE THE BEST OF AN AWKWARD SITUATION THE VOYAGE PROGRESSED AND
THE VESSEL NEARED AMERICA
BUT BY AND BY TWO HUNDRED MILES OFF NEW BEDFORD THE SHIP TOOK FIRE
SHE BURNED TO THE WATER'S EDGE OF ALL HER CREW AND PASSENGERS ONLY
THIRTY WERE SAVED
THEY FLOATED ABOUT THE SEA HALF AN AFTERNOON AND ALL
NIGHT LONG
AMONG THEM WERE OUR FRIENDS
THE LAWYER BY SUPERHUMAN
EXERTIONS HAD SAVED THE BLONDE AND HER PARENTS SWIMMING BACK AND FORTH
TWO HUNDRED YARDS AND BRINGING ONE EACH TIME THE GIRL FIRST
THE DUKE
HAD SAVED HIMSELF
IN THE MORNING TWO WHALE SHIPS ARRIVED ON THE SCENE
AND SENT THEIR BOATS
THE WEATHER WAS STORMY AND THE EMBARKATION WAS
ATTENDED WITH MUCH CONFUSION AND EXCITEMENT
THE LAWYER DID HIS DUTY
LIKE A MAN HELPED HIS EXHAUSTED AND INSENSIBLE BLONDE HER PARENTS AND
SOME OTHERS INTO A BOAT THE DUKE HELPED HIMSELF IN THEN A CHILD FELL
OVERBOARD AT THE OTHER END OF THE RAFT AND THE LAWYER RUSHED THITHER AND
HELPED HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE FISH IT OUT UNDER THE STIMULUS OF ITS
MOTHER'S SCREAMS
THEN HE RAN BACK A FEW SECONDS TOO LATE THE BLONDE'S
BOAT WAS UNDER WAY
SO HE HAD TO TAKE THE OTHER BOAT AND GO TO THE
OTHER SHIP
THE STORM INCREASED AND DROVE THE VESSELS OUT OF SIGHT OF
EACH OTHER DROVE THEM WHITHER IT WOULD
WHEN IT CALMED AT THE END OF THREE DAYS THE BLONDE'S SHIP WAS SEVEN
HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF BOSTON AND THE OTHER ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED SOUTH OF
THAT PORT
THE BLONDE'S CAPTAIN WAS BOUND ON A WHALING CRUISE IN THE
NORTH ATLANTIC AND COULD NOT GO BACK SUCH A DISTANCE OR MAKE A PORT
WITHOUT ORDERS SUCH BEING NAUTICAL LAW
THE LAWYER'S CAPTAIN WAS TO
CRUISE IN THE NORTH PACIFIC AND HE COULD NOT GO BACK OR MAKE A PORT
WITHOUT ORDERS
ALL THE LAWYER'S MONEY AND BAGGAGE WERE IN THE BLONDE'S
BOAT AND WENT TO THE BLONDE'S SHIP SO HIS CAPTAIN MADE HIM WORK HIS
PASSAGE AS A COMMON SAILOR
WHEN BOTH SHIPS HAD BEEN CRUISING NEARLY A
YEAR THE ONE WAS OFF THE COAST OF GREENLAND AND THE OTHER IN BEHRING'S
STRAIT
THE BLONDE HAD LONG AGO BEEN WELL NIGH PERSUADED THAT HER LAWYER
HAD BEEN WASHED OVERBOARD AND LOST JUST BEFORE THE WHALE SHIPS REACHED
THE RAFT AND NOW UNDER THE PLEADINGS OF HER PARENTS AND THE DUKE SHE
WAS AT LAST BEGINNING TO NERVE HERSELF FOR THE DOOM OF THE COVENANT AND
PREPARE FOR THE HATED MARRIAGE
BUT SHE WOULD NOT YIELD A DAY BEFORE THE DATE SET
THE WEEKS DRAGGED ON
THE TIME NARROWED ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO DECK THE SHIP FOR THE WEDDING A
WEDDING AT SEA AMONG ICEBERGS AND WALRUSES
FIVE DAYS MORE AND ALL WOULD
BE OVER
SO THE BLONDE REFLECTED WITH A SIGH AND A TEAR
OH WHERE WAS
HER TRUE LOVE AND WHY WHY DID HE NOT COME AND SAVE HER AT THAT MOMENT
HE WAS LIFTING HIS HARPOON TO STRIKE A WHALE IN BEHRING'S STRAIT FIVE
THOUSAND MILES AWAY BY THE WAY OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN OR TWENTY THOUSAND
BY THE WAY OF THE HORN THAT WAS THE REASON
HE STRUCK BUT NOT WITH
PERFECT AIM HIS FOOT SLIPPED AND HE FELL IN THE WHALE'S MOUTH AND WENT
DOWN HIS THROAT
HE WAS INSENSIBLE FIVE DAYS
THEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF
AND HEARD VOICES DAYLIGHT WAS STREAMING THROUGH A HOLE CUT IN THE
WHALE'S ROOF
HE CLIMBED OUT AND ASTONISHED THE SAILORS WHO WERE
HOISTING BLUBBER UP A SHIP'S SIDE
HE RECOGNIZED THE VESSEL FLEW
ABOARD SURPRISED THE WEDDING PARTY AT THE ALTAR AND EXCLAIMED
STOP THE PROCEEDINGS I'M HERE COME TO MY ARMS MY OWN
THERE WERE FOOT NOTES TO THIS EXTRAVAGANT PIECE OF LITERATURE WHEREIN THE
AUTHOR ENDEAVORED TO SHOW THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS WITHIN THE
POSSIBILITIES HE SAID HE GOT THE INCIDENT OF THE WHALE TRAVELING FROM
BEHRING'S STRAIT TO THE COAST OF GREENLAND FIVE THOUSAND MILES IN FIVE
DAYS THROUGH THE ARCTIC OCEAN FROM CHARLES READE'S LOVE ME LITTLE LOVE
ME LONG AND CONSIDERED THAT THAT ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT THE THING
COULD BE DONE AND HE INSTANCED JONAH'S ADVENTURE AS PROOF THAT A MAN
COULD LIVE IN A WHALE'S BELLY AND ADDED THAT IF A PREACHER COULD STAND
IT THREE DAYS A LAWYER COULD SURELY STAND IT FIVE
THERE WAS A FIERCER STORM THAN EVER IN THE EDITORIAL SANCTUM NOW AND THE
STRANGER WAS PEREMPTORILY DISCHARGED AND HIS MANUSCRIPT FLUNG AT HIS
HEAD
BUT HE HAD ALREADY DELAYED THINGS SO MUCH THAT THERE WAS NOT TIME
FOR SOME ONE ELSE TO REWRITE THE CHAPTER AND SO THE PAPER CAME OUT
WITHOUT ANY NOVEL IN IT
IT WAS BUT A FEEBLE STRUGGLING STUPID
JOURNAL AND THE ABSENCE OF THE NOVEL PROBABLY SHOOK PUBLIC CONFIDENCE
AT ANY RATE BEFORE THE FIRST SIDE OF THE NEXT ISSUE WENT TO PRESS THE
WEEKLY OCCIDENTAL DIED AS PEACEFULLY AS AN INFANT
AN EFFORT WAS MADE TO RESURRECT IT WITH THE PROPOSED ADVANTAGE OF A
TELLING NEW TITLE AND MR
F
SAID THAT THE PHENIX WOULD BE JUST THE NAME
FOR IT BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE THE IDEA OF A RESURRECTION FROM ITS DEAD
ASHES IN A NEW AND UNDREAMED OF CONDITION OF SPLENDOR BUT SOME
LOW PRICED SMARTY ON ONE OF THE DAILIES SUGGESTED THAT WE CALL IT THE
LAZARUS AND INASMUCH AS THE PEOPLE WERE NOT PROFOUND IN SCRIPTURAL
MATTERS BUT THOUGHT THE RESURRECTED LAZARUS AND THE DILAPIDATED MENDICANT
THAT BEGGED IN THE RICH MAN'S GATEWAY WERE ONE AND THE SAME PERSON THE
NAME BECAME THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE TOWN AND KILLED THE PAPER FOR GOOD
AND ALL
I WAS SORRY ENOUGH FOR I WAS VERY PROUD OF BEING CONNECTED WITH A
LITERARY PAPER PROUDER THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN OF ANYTHING SINCE PERHAPS
I HAD WRITTEN SOME RHYMES FOR IT POETRY I CONSIDERED IT AND IT WAS A
GREAT GRIEF TO ME THAT THE PRODUCTION WAS ON THE FIRST SIDE OF THE
ISSUE THAT WAS NOT COMPLETED AND HENCE DID NOT SEE THE LIGHT
BUT TIME
BRINGS ITS REVENGES I CAN PUT IT IN HERE IT WILL ANSWER IN PLACE OF A
TEAR DROPPED TO THE MEMORY OF THE LOST OCCIDENTAL
THE IDEA NOT THE
CHIEF IDEA BUT THE VEHICLE THAT BEARS IT WAS PROBABLY SUGGESTED BY THE
OLD SONG CALLED THE RAGING CANAL BUT I CANNOT REMEMBER NOW
I DO
REMEMBER THOUGH THAT AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT MY DOGGEREL WAS ONE OF THE
ABLEST POEMS OF THE AGE
THE AGED PILOT MAN
ON THE ERIE CANAL IT WAS
ALL ON A SUMMER'S DAY
I SAILED FORTH WITH MY PARENTS
FAR AWAY TO ALBANY
FROM OUT THE CLOUDS AT NOON THAT DAY
THERE CAME A DREADFUL STORM
THAT PILED THE BILLOWS HIGH ABOUT
AND FILLED US WITH ALARM
A MAN CAME RUSHING FROM A HOUSE
SAYING SNUB UP YOUR BOAT I PRAY
THE CUSTOMARY CANAL TECHNICALITY FOR 'TIE UP
SNUB UP YOUR BOAT SNUB UP ALAS
SNUB UP WHILE YET YOU MAY
OUR CAPTAIN CAST ONE GLANCE ASTERN
THEN FORWARD GLANCED HE
AND SAID MY WIFE AND LITTLE ONES

SAID DOLLINGER THE PILOT MAN
IN NOBLE WORDS BUT FEW
FEAR NOT BUT LEAN ON DOLLINGER
AND HE WILL FETCH YOU THROUGH
THE BOAT DROVE ON THE FRIGHTENED MULES
TORE THROUGH THE RAIN AND WIND
AND BRAVELY STILL IN DANGER'S POST
THE WHIP BOY STRODE BEHIND
COME 'BOARD COME 'BOARD THE CAPTAIN CRIED
NOR TEMPT SO WILD A STORM
BUT STILL THE RAGING MULES ADVANCED
AND STILL THE BOY STRODE ON
THEN SAID THE CAPTAIN TO US ALL
ALAS 'TIS PLAIN TO ME
THE GREATER DANGER IS NOT THERE
BUT HERE UPON THE SEA
SO LET US STRIVE WHILE LIFE REMAINS
TO SAVE ALL SOULS ON BOARD
AND THEN IF DIE AT LAST WE MUST
LET
I CANNOT SPEAK THE WORD
SAID DOLLINGER THE PILOT MAN
TOW'RING ABOVE THE CREW
FEAR NOT BUT TRUST IN DOLLINGER
AND HE WILL FETCH YOU THROUGH
LOW BRIDGE LOW BRIDGE ALL HEADS WENT DOWN
THE LABORING BARK SPED ON
A MILL WE PASSED WE PASSED CHURCH
HAMLETS AND FIELDS OF CORN
AND ALL THE WORLD CAME OUT TO SEE
AND CHASED ALONG THE SHORE
CRYING ALAS ALAS THE SHEETED RAIN
THE WIND THE TEMPEST'S ROAR
ALAS THE GALLANT SHIP AND CREW
CAN NOTHING HELP THEM MORE
AND FROM OUR DECK SAD EYES LOOKED OUT
ACROSS THE STORMY SCENE
THE TOSSING WAKE OF BILLOWS AFT
THE BENDING FORESTS GREEN
THE CHICKENS SHELTERED UNDER CARTS
IN LEE OF BARN THE COWS
THE SKURRYING SWINE WITH STRAW IN MOUTH
THE WILD SPRAY FROM OUR BOWS
SHE BALANCES
SHE WAVERS
NOW LET HER GO ABOUT
IF SHE MISSES STAYS AND BROACHES TO
WE'RE ALL THEN WITH A SHOUT
HURAY HURAY
AVAST BELAY
TAKE IN MORE SAIL
LORD WHAT A GALE
HO BOY HAUL TAUT ON THE HIND MULE'S TAIL
HO LIGHTEN SHIP HO MAN THE PUMP
HO HOSTLER HEAVE THE LEAD
A QUARTER THREE 'TIS SHOALING FAST
THREE FEET LARGE T H R E E FEET
THREE FEET SCANT I CRIED IN FRIGHT
OH IS THERE NO RETREAT
SAID DOLLINGER THE PILOT MAN
AS ON THE VESSEL FLEW
FEAR NOT BUT TRUST IN DOLLINGER
AND HE WILL FETCH YOU THROUGH
A PANIC STRUCK THE BRAVEST HEARTS
THE BOLDEST CHEEK TURNED PALE
FOR PLAIN TO ALL THIS SHOALING SAID
A LEAK HAD BURST THE DITCH'S BED
AND STRAIGHT AS BOLT FROM CROSSBOW SPED
OUR SHIP SWEPT ON WITH SHOALING LEAD
BEFORE THE FEARFUL GALE
SEVER THE TOW LINE CRIPPLE THE MULES
TOO LATE THERE COMES A SHOCK
ANOTHER LENGTH AND THE FATED CRAFT
WOULD HAVE SWUM IN THE SAVING LOCK
THEN GATHERED TOGETHER THE SHIPWRECKED CREW
AND TOOK ONE LAST EMBRACE
WHILE SORROWFUL TEARS FROM DESPAIRING EYES
RAN DOWN EACH HOPELESS FACE
AND SOME DID THINK OF THEIR LITTLE ONES
WHOM THEY NEVER MORE MIGHT SEE
AND OTHERS OF WAITING WIVES AT HOME
AND MOTHERS THAT GRIEVED WOULD BE
BUT OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF MISERY THERE
ON THAT POOR SINKING FRAME
BUT ONE SPAKE WORDS OF HOPE AND FAITH
AND I WORSHIPPED AS THEY CAME
SAID DOLLINGER THE PILOT MAN
O BRAVE HEART STRONG AND TRUE
FEAR NOT BUT TRUST IN DOLLINGER
FOR HE WILL FETCH YOU THROUGH
LO SCARCE THE WORDS HAVE PASSED HIS LIPS
THE DAUNTLESS PROPHET SAY'TH
WHEN EVERY SOUL ABOUT HIM SEETH
A WONDER CROWN HIS FAITH

AS NUMBERED WITH THE DEAD
FOR MARINER FOR FORTY YEAR
ON ERIE BOY AND MAN
I NEVER YET SAW SUCH A STORM
OR ONE'T WITH IT BEGAN
SO OVERBOARD A KEG OF NAILS
AND ANVILS THREE WE THREW
LIKEWISE FOUR BALES OF GUNNY SACKS
TWO HUNDRED POUNDS OF GLUE
TWO SACKS OF CORN FOUR DITTO WHEAT
A BOX OF BOOKS A COW
A VIOLIN LORD BYRON'S WORKS
A RIP SAW AND A SOW
A CURVE A CURVE THE DANGERS GROW
LABBORD STABBORD S T E A D Y SO
HARD A PORT DOL HELLUM A LEE
HAW THE HEAD MULE THE AFT ONE GEE
LUFF BRING HER TO THE WIND
FOR STRAIGHT A FARMER BROUGHT A PLANK
MYSTERIOUSLY INSPIRED
AND LAYING IT UNTO THE SHIP
IN SILENT AWE RETIRED
THEN EVERY SUFFERER STOOD AMAZED
THAT PILOT MAN BEFORE
A MOMENT STOOD
THEN WONDERING TURNED
AND SPEECHLESS WALKED ASHORE
CHAPTER LII
SINCE I DESIRE IN THIS CHAPTER TO SAY AN INSTRUCTIVE WORD OR TWO ABOUT
THE SILVER MINES THE READER MAY TAKE THIS FAIR WARNING AND SKIP IF HE
CHOOSES
THE YEAR 1863 WAS PERHAPS THE VERY TOP BLOSSOM AND CULMINATION
OF THE FLUSH TIMES VIRGINIA SWARMED WITH MEN AND VEHICLES TO THAT
DEGREE THAT THE PLACE LOOKED LIKE A VERY HIVE THAT IS WHEN ONE'S VISION
COULD PIERCE THROUGH THE THICK FOG OF ALKALI DUST THAT WAS GENERALLY
BLOWING IN SUMMER
I WILL SAY CONCERNING THIS DUST THAT IF YOU DROVE
TEN MILES THROUGH IT YOU AND YOUR HORSES WOULD BE COATED WITH IT A
SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH THICK AND PRESENT AN OUTSIDE APPEARANCE THAT WAS A
UNIFORM PALE YELLOW COLOR AND YOUR BUGGY WOULD HAVE THREE INCHES OF DUST
IN IT THROWN THERE BY THE WHEELS
THE DELICATE SCALES USED BY THE
ASSAYERS WERE INCLOSED IN GLASS CASES INTENDED TO BE AIR TIGHT AND YET
SOME OF THIS DUST WAS SO IMPALPABLE AND SO INVISIBLY FINE THAT IT WOULD
GET IN SOMEHOW AND IMPAIR THE ACCURACY OF THOSE SCALES
SPECULATION RAN RIOT AND YET THERE WAS A WORLD OF SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS
GOING ON TOO
ALL FREIGHTS WERE BROUGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS FROM
CALIFORNIA 150 MILES BY PACK TRAIN PARTLY AND PARTLY IN HUGE WAGONS
DRAWN BY SUCH LONG MULE TEAMS THAT EACH TEAM AMOUNTED TO A PROCESSION
AND IT DID SEEM SOMETIMES THAT THE GRAND COMBINED PROCESSION OF ANIMALS
STRETCHED UNBROKEN FROM VIRGINIA TO CALIFORNIA
ITS LONG ROUTE WAS
TRACEABLE CLEAR ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE TERRITORY BY THE WRITHING
SERPENT OF DUST IT LIFTED UP
BY THESE WAGONS FREIGHTS OVER THAT
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES WERE 200 A TON FOR SMALL LOTS SAME PRICE FOR
ALL EXPRESS MATTER BROUGHT BY STAGE AND 100 A TON FOR FULL LOADS
ONE VIRGINIA FIRM RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED TONS OF FREIGHT A MONTH AND PAID
10 000 A MONTH FREIGHTAGE
IN THE WINTER THE FREIGHTS WERE MUCH HIGHER
ALL THE BULLION WAS SHIPPED IN BARS BY STAGE TO SAN FRANCISCO A BAR WAS
USUALLY ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF A PIG OF LEAD AND CONTAINED FROM 1 500
TO 3 000 ACCORDING TO THE AMOUNT OF GOLD MIXED WITH THE SILVER AND THE
FREIGHT ON IT WHEN THE SHIPMENT WAS LARGE WAS ONE AND A QUARTER PER
CENT
OF ITS INTRINSIC VALUE
SO THE FREIGHT ON THESE BARS PROBABLY AVERAGED SOMETHING MORE THAN 25
EACH
SMALL SHIPPERS PAID TWO PER CENT
THERE WERE THREE STAGES A DAY
EACH WAY AND I HAVE SEEN THE OUT GOING STAGES CARRY AWAY A THIRD OF A
TON OF BULLION EACH AND MORE THAN ONCE I SAW THEM DIVIDE A TWO TON LOT
AND TAKE IT OFF
HOWEVER THESE WERE EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS
MR
VALENTINE WELLS FARGO'S AGENT HAS HANDLED ALL THE BULLION SHIPPED
THROUGH THE VIRGINIA OFFICE FOR MANY A MONTH
TO HIS MEMORY WHICH IS
EXCELLENT WE ARE INDEBTED FOR THE FOLLOWING EXHIBIT OF THE COMPANY'S
BUSINESS IN THE VIRGINIA OFFICE SINCE THE FIRST OF JANUARY 1862 FROM
JANUARY 1ST TO APRIL 1ST ABOUT 270 000 WORTH OF BULLION PASSED THROUGH
THAT OFFICE DURING THE NEXT QUARTER 570 000 NEXT QUARTER 800 000
NEXT QUARTER 956 000 NEXT QUARTER 1 275 000 AND FOR THE QUARTER
ENDING ON THE 30TH OF LAST JUNE ABOUT 1 600 000
THUS IN A YEAR AND A
HALF THE VIRGINIA OFFICE ONLY SHIPPED 5 330 000 IN BULLION
DURING THE
YEAR 1862 THEY SHIPPED 2 615 000 SO WE PERCEIVE THE AVERAGE SHIPMENTS
HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS
THIS GIVES US ROOM TO
PROMISE FOR THE VIRGINIA OFFICE 500 000 A MONTH FOR THE YEAR 1863
THOUGH PERHAPS JUDGING BY THE STEADY INCREASE IN THE BUSINESS WE ARE
UNDER ESTIMATING SOMEWHAT
THIS GIVES US 6 000 000 FOR THE YEAR
GOLD HILL AND SILVER CITY TOGETHER CAN BEAT US WE WILL GIVE THEM
10 000 000
TO DAYTON EMPIRE CITY OPHIR AND CARSON CITY WE WILL
ALLOW AN AGGREGATE OF 8 000 000 WHICH IS NOT OVER THE MARK PERHAPS
AND MAY POSSIBLY BE A LITTLE UNDER IT
TO ESMERALDA WE GIVE 4 000 000
TO REESE RIVER AND HUMBOLDT 2 000 000 WHICH IS LIBERAL NOW BUT MAY NOT
BE BEFORE THE YEAR IS OUT
SO WE PROGNOSTICATE THAT THE YIELD OF BULLION
THIS YEAR WILL BE ABOUT 30 000 000
PLACING THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN THE
TERRITORY AT ONE HUNDRED THIS GIVES TO EACH THE LABOR OF PRODUCING
300 000 IN BULLION DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS
ALLOWING THEM TO RUN THREE
HUNDRED DAYS IN THE YEAR WHICH NONE OF THEM MORE THAN DO THIS MAKES
THEIR WORK AVERAGE 1 000 A DAY
SAY THE MILLS AVERAGE TWENTY TONS OF
ROCK A DAY AND THIS ROCK WORTH 50 AS A GENERAL THING AND YOU HAVE THE
ACTUAL WORK OF OUR ONE HUNDRED MILLS FIGURED DOWN TO A SPOT 1 000 A
DAY EACH AND 30 000 000 A YEAR IN THE AGGREGATE ENTERPRISE
A CONSIDERABLE OVER ESTIMATE M
T
TWO TONS OF SILVER BULLION WOULD BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FORTY BARS
AND THE FREIGHT ON IT OVER 1 000
EACH COACH ALWAYS CARRIED A DEAL OF
ORDINARY EXPRESS MATTER BESIDE AND ALSO FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY
PASSENGERS AT FROM 25 TO 30 A HEAD
WITH SIX STAGES GOING ALL THE
TIME WELLS FARGO AND CO 'S VIRGINIA CITY BUSINESS WAS IMPORTANT AND
LUCRATIVE
ALL ALONG UNDER THE CENTRE OF VIRGINIA AND GOLD HILL FOR A COUPLE OF
MILES RAN THE GREAT COMSTOCK SILVER LODE A VEIN OF ORE FROM FIFTY TO
EIGHTY FEET THICK BETWEEN ITS SOLID WALLS OF ROCK A VEIN AS WIDE AS SOME
OF NEW YORK'S STREETS
I WILL REMIND THE READER THAT IN PENNSYLVANIA A
COAL VEIN ONLY EIGHT FEET WIDE IS CONSIDERED AMPLE
VIRGINIA WAS A BUSY CITY OF STREETS AND HOUSES ABOVE GROUND
UNDER IT
WAS ANOTHER BUSY CITY DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH WHERE A GREAT
POPULATION OF MEN THRONGED IN AND OUT AMONG AN INTRICATE MAZE OF TUNNELS
AND DRIFTS FLITTING HITHER AND THITHER UNDER A WINKING SPARKLE OF
LIGHTS AND OVER THEIR HEADS TOWERED A VAST WEB OF INTERLOCKING TIMBERS
THAT HELD THE WALLS OF THE GUTTED COMSTOCK APART
THESE TIMBERS WERE AS
LARGE AS A MAN'S BODY AND THE FRAMEWORK STRETCHED UPWARD SO FAR THAT NO
EYE COULD PIERCE TO ITS TOP THROUGH THE CLOSING GLOOM
IT WAS LIKE
PEERING UP THROUGH THE CLEAN PICKED RIBS AND BONES OF SOME COLOSSAL
SKELETON
IMAGINE SUCH A FRAMEWORK TWO MILES LONG SIXTY FEET WIDE AND
HIGHER THAN ANY CHURCH SPIRE IN AMERICA
IMAGINE THIS STATELY
LATTICE WORK STRETCHING DOWN BROADWAY FROM THE ST
NICHOLAS TO WALL
STREET AND A FOURTH OF JULY PROCESSION REDUCED TO PIGMIES PARADING ON
TOP OF IT AND FLAUNTING THEIR FLAGS HIGH ABOVE THE PINNACLE OF TRINITY
STEEPLE
ONE CAN IMAGINE THAT BUT HE CANNOT WELL IMAGINE WHAT THAT
FOREST OF TIMBERS COST FROM THE TIME THEY WERE FELLED IN THE PINERIES
BEYOND WASHOE LAKE HAULED UP AND AROUND MOUNT DAVIDSON AT ATROCIOUS
RATES OF FREIGHTAGE THEN SQUARED LET DOWN INTO THE DEEP MAW OF THE MINE
AND BUILT UP THERE
TWENTY AMPLE FORTUNES WOULD NOT TIMBER ONE OF THE
GREATEST OF THOSE SILVER MINES
THE SPANISH PROVERB SAYS IT REQUIRES A
GOLD MINE TO RUN A SILVER ONE AND IT IS TRUE
A BEGGAR WITH A SILVER
MINE IS A PITIABLE PAUPER INDEED IF HE CANNOT SELL
I SPOKE OF THE UNDERGROUND VIRGINIA AS A CITY
THE GOULD AND CURRY IS
ONLY ONE SINGLE MINE UNDER THERE AMONG A GREAT MANY OTHERS YET THE
GOULD AND CURRY'S STREETS OF DISMAL DRIFTS AND TUNNELS WERE FIVE MILES IN
EXTENT ALTOGETHER AND ITS POPULATION FIVE HUNDRED MINERS
TAKEN AS A
WHOLE THE UNDERGROUND CITY HAD SOME THIRTY MILES OF STREETS AND A
POPULATION OF FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND
IN THIS PRESENT DAY SOME OF THOSE
POPULATIONS ARE AT WORK FROM TWELVE TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED FEET UNDER
VIRGINIA AND GOLD HILL AND THE SIGNAL BELLS THAT TELL THEM WHAT THE
SUPERINTENDENT ABOVE GROUND DESIRES THEM TO DO ARE STRUCK BY TELEGRAPH AS
WE STRIKE A FIRE ALARM
SOMETIMES MEN FALL DOWN A SHAFT THERE A
THOUSAND FEET DEEP
IN SUCH CASES THE USUAL PLAN IS TO HOLD AN INQUEST
IF YOU WISH TO VISIT ONE OF THOSE MINES YOU MAY WALK THROUGH A TUNNEL
ABOUT HALF A MILE LONG IF YOU PREFER IT OR YOU MAY TAKE THE QUICKER PLAN
OF SHOOTING LIKE A DART DOWN A SHAFT ON A SMALL PLATFORM
IT IS LIKE
TUMBLING DOWN THROUGH AN EMPTY STEEPLE FEET FIRST
WHEN YOU REACH THE
BOTTOM YOU TAKE A CANDLE AND TRAMP THROUGH DRIFTS AND TUNNELS WHERE
THRONGS OF MEN ARE DIGGING AND BLASTING YOU WATCH THEM SEND UP TUBS FULL
OF GREAT LUMPS OF STONE SILVER ORE YOU SELECT CHOICE SPECIMENS FROM THE
MASS AS SOUVENIRS YOU ADMIRE THE WORLD OF SKELETON TIMBERING YOU
REFLECT FREQUENTLY THAT YOU ARE BURIED UNDER A MOUNTAIN A THOUSAND FEET
BELOW DAYLIGHT BEING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE MINE YOU CLIMB FROM GALLERY
TO GALLERY UP ENDLESS LADDERS THAT STAND STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN WHEN
YOUR LEGS FAIL YOU AT LAST YOU LIE DOWN IN A SMALL BOX CAR IN A CRAMPED
INCLINE LIKE A HALF UP ENDED SEWER AND ARE DRAGGED UP TO DAYLIGHT
FEELING AS IF YOU ARE CRAWLING THROUGH A COFFIN THAT HAS NO END TO IT
ARRIVED AT THE TOP YOU FIND A BUSY CROWD OF MEN RECEIVING THE ASCENDING
CARS AND TUBS AND DUMPING THE ORE FROM AN ELEVATION INTO LONG ROWS OF
BINS CAPABLE OF HOLDING HALF A DOZEN TONS EACH UNDER THE BINS ARE ROWS
OF WAGONS LOADING FROM CHUTES AND TRAP DOORS IN THE BINS AND DOWN THE
LONG STREET IS A PROCESSION OF THESE WAGONS WENDING TOWARD THE SILVER
MILLS WITH THEIR RICH FREIGHT
IT IS ALL DONE NOW AND THERE YOU ARE
YOU NEED NEVER GO DOWN AGAIN FOR YOU HAVE SEEN IT ALL
IF YOU HAVE
FORGOTTEN THE PROCESS OF REDUCING THE ORE IN THE MILL AND MAKING THE
SILVER BARS YOU CAN GO BACK AND FIND IT AGAIN IN MY ESMERALDA CHAPTERS
IF SO DISPOSED
OF COURSE THESE MINES CAVE IN IN PLACES OCCASIONALLY AND THEN IT IS
WORTH ONE'S WHILE TO TAKE THE RISK OF DESCENDING INTO THEM AND OBSERVING
THE CRUSHING POWER EXERTED BY THE PRESSING WEIGHT OF A SETTLING MOUNTAIN
I PUBLISHED SUCH AN EXPERIENCE IN THE ENTERPRISE ONCE AND FROM IT I
WILL TAKE AN EXTRACT
AN HOUR IN THE CAVED MINES WE JOURNEYED DOWN INTO THE OPHIR MINE
YESTERDAY TO SEE THE EARTHQUAKE
WE COULD NOT GO DOWN THE DEEP
INCLINE BECAUSE IT STILL HAS A PROPENSITY TO CAVE IN PLACES
THEREFORE WE TRAVELED THROUGH THE LONG TUNNEL WHICH ENTERS THE HILL
ABOVE THE OPHIR OFFICE AND THEN BY MEANS OF A SERIES OF LONG
LADDERS CLIMBED AWAY DOWN FROM THE FIRST TO THE FOURTH GALLERY
TRAVERSING A DRIFT WE CAME TO THE SPANISH LINE PASSED FIVE SETS OF
TIMBERS STILL UNINJURED AND FOUND THE EARTHQUAKE
HERE WAS AS
COMPLETE A CHAOS AS EVER WAS SEEN VAST MASSES OF EARTH AND
SPLINTERED AND BROKEN TIMBERS PILED CONFUSEDLY TOGETHER WITH
SCARCELY AN APERTURE LEFT LARGE ENOUGH FOR A CAT TO CREEP THROUGH
RUBBISH WAS STILL FALLING AT INTERVALS FROM ABOVE AND ONE TIMBER
WHICH HAD BRACED OTHERS EARLIER IN THE DAY WAS NOW CRUSHED DOWN OUT
OF ITS FORMER POSITION SHOWING THAT THE CAVING AND SETTLING OF THE
TREMENDOUS MASS WAS STILL GOING ON
WE WERE IN THAT PORTION OF THE
OPHIR KNOWN AS THE NORTH MINES RETURNING TO THE SURFACE WE
ENTERED A TUNNEL LEADING INTO THE CENTRAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF
GETTING INTO THE MAIN OPHIR
DESCENDING A LONG INCLINE IN THIS
TUNNEL WE TRAVERSED A DRIFT OR SO AND THEN WENT DOWN A DEEP SHAFT
FROM WHENCE WE PROCEEDED INTO THE FIFTH GALLERY OF THE OPHIR
FROM
A SIDE DRIFT WE CRAWLED THROUGH A SMALL HOLE AND GOT INTO THE MIDST
OF THE EARTHQUAKE AGAIN EARTH AND BROKEN TIMBERS MINGLED TOGETHER
WITHOUT REGARD TO GRACE OR SYMMETRY
A LARGE PORTION OF THE SECOND
THIRD AND FOURTH GALLERIES HAD CAVED IN AND GONE TO DESTRUCTION THE
TWO LATTER AT SEVEN O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
AT THE TURN TABLE NEAR THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE FIFTH GALLERY
TWO BIG PILES OF RUBBISH HAD FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH FROM THE FIFTH
GALLERY AND FROM THE LOOKS OF THE TIMBERS MORE WAS ABOUT TO COME
THESE BEAMS ARE SOLID EIGHTEEN INCHES SQUARE FIRST A GREAT BEAM
IS LAID ON THE FLOOR THEN UPRIGHT ONES FIVE FEET HIGH STAND ON
IT SUPPORTING ANOTHER HORIZONTAL BEAM AND SO ON SQUARE ABOVE
SQUARE LIKE THE FRAMEWORK OF A WINDOW
THE SUPERINCUMBENT WEIGHT
WAS SUFFICIENT TO MASH THE ENDS OF THOSE GREAT UPRIGHT BEAMS FAIRLY
INTO THE SOLID WOOD OF THE HORIZONTAL ONES THREE INCHES COMPRESSING
AND BENDING THE UPRIGHT BEAM TILL IT CURVED LIKE A BOW
BEFORE THE
SPANISH CAVED IN SOME OF THEIR TWELVE INCH HORIZONTAL TIMBERS WERE
COMPRESSED IN THIS WAY UNTIL THEY WERE ONLY FIVE INCHES THICK
IMAGINE THE POWER IT MUST TAKE TO SQUEEZE A SOLID LOG TOGETHER IN
THAT WAY
HERE ALSO WAS A RANGE OF TIMBERS FOR A DISTANCE OF
TWENTY FEET TILTED SIX INCHES OUT OF THE PERPENDICULAR BY THE
WEIGHT RESTING UPON THEM FROM THE CAVED GALLERIES ABOVE
YOU COULD
HEAR THINGS CRACKING AND GIVING WAY AND IT WAS NOT PLEASANT TO KNOW
THAT THE WORLD OVERHEAD WAS SLOWLY AND SILENTLY SINKING DOWN UPON
YOU
THE MEN DOWN IN THE MINE DO NOT MIND IT HOWEVER
RETURNING ALONG THE FIFTH GALLERY WE STRUCK THE SAFE PART OF THE
OPHIR INCLINE AND WENT DOWN IT TO THE SIXTH BUT WE FOUND TEN
INCHES OF WATER THERE AND HAD TO COME BACK
IN REPAIRING THE
DAMAGE DONE TO THE INCLINE THE PUMP HAD TO BE STOPPED FOR TWO
HOURS AND IN THE MEANTIME THE WATER GAINED ABOUT A FOOT
HOWEVER
THE PUMP WAS AT WORK AGAIN AND THE FLOOD WATER WAS DECREASING
WE CLIMBED UP TO THE FIFTH GALLERY AGAIN AND SOUGHT A DEEP SHAFT
WHEREBY WE MIGHT DESCEND TO ANOTHER PART OF THE SIXTH OUT OF REACH
OF THE WATER BUT SUFFERED DISAPPOINTMENT AS THE MEN HAD GONE TO
DINNER AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO MAN THE WINDLASS
SO HAVING SEEN
THE EARTHQUAKE WE CLIMBED OUT AT THE UNION INCLINE AND TUNNEL AND
ADJOURNED ALL DRIPPING WITH CANDLE GREASE AND PERSPIRATION TO
LUNCH AT THE OPHIR OFFICE
DURING THE GREAT FLUSH YEAR OF 1863 NEVADA CLAIMS TO HAVE
PRODUCED 25 000 000 IN BULLION ALMOST IF NOT QUITE A ROUND
MILLION TO EACH THOUSAND INHABITANTS WHICH IS VERY WELL
CONSIDERING THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES
SILVER MINING WAS HER SOLE PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRY
SINCE THE ABOVE WAS
IN TYPE I LEARN FROM AN OFFICIAL SOURCE THAT THE ABOVE FIGURE IS
TOO HIGH AND THAT THE YIELD FOR 1863 DID NOT EXCEED 20 000 000
HOWEVER THE DAY FOR LARGE FIGURES IS APPROACHING THE SUTRO TUNNEL
IS TO PLOW THROUGH THE COMSTOCK LODE FROM END TO END AT A DEPTH OF
TWO THOUSAND FEET AND THEN MINING WILL BE EASY AND COMPARATIVELY
INEXPENSIVE AND THE MOMENTOUS MATTERS OF DRAINAGE AND HOISTING AND
HAULING OF ORE WILL CEASE TO BE BURDENSOME
THIS VAST WORK WILL
ABSORB MANY YEARS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ITS COMPLETION BUT
IT WILL EARLY YIELD MONEY FOR THAT DESIRABLE EPOCH WILL BEGIN AS
SOON AS IT STRIKES THE FIRST END OF THE VEIN
THE TUNNEL WILL BE
SOME EIGHT MILES LONG AND WILL DEVELOP ASTONISHING RICHES
CARS
WILL CARRY THE ORE THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND DUMP IT IN THE MILLS AND
THUS DO AWAY WITH THE PRESENT COSTLY SYSTEM OF DOUBLE HANDLING AND
TRANSPORTATION BY MULE TEAMS
THE WATER FROM THE TUNNEL WILL
FURNISH THE MOTIVE POWER FOR THE MILLS
MR
SUTRO THE ORIGINATOR
OF THIS PRODIGIOUS ENTERPRISE IS ONE OF THE FEW MEN IN THE WORLD
WHO IS GIFTED WITH THE PLUCK AND PERSEVERANCE NECESSARY TO FOLLOW UP
AND HOUND SUCH AN UNDERTAKING TO ITS COMPLETION
HE HAS CONVERTED
SEVERAL OBSTINATE CONGRESSES TO A DESERVED FRIENDLINESS TOWARD HIS
IMPORTANT WORK AND HAS GONE UP AND DOWN AND TO AND FRO IN EUROPE
UNTIL HE HAS ENLISTED A GREAT MONEYED INTEREST IN IT THERE
CHAPTER LIII
EVERY NOW AND THEN IN THESE DAYS THE BOYS USED TO TELL ME I OUGHT TO
GET ONE JIM BLAINE TO TELL ME THE STIRRING STORY OF HIS GRANDFATHER'S OLD
RAM BUT THEY ALWAYS ADDED THAT I MUST NOT MENTION THE MATTER UNLESS JIM
WAS DRUNK AT THE TIME JUST COMFORTABLY AND SOCIABLY DRUNK
THEY KEPT
THIS UP UNTIL MY CURIOSITY WAS ON THE RACK TO HEAR THE STORY
I GOT TO
HAUNTING BLAINE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE THE BOYS ALWAYS FOUND FAULT WITH
HIS CONDITION HE WAS OFTEN MODERATELY BUT NEVER SATISFACTORILY DRUNK
I NEVER WATCHED A MAN'S CONDITION WITH SUCH ABSORBING INTEREST SUCH
ANXIOUS SOLICITUDE I NEVER SO PINED TO SEE A MAN UNCOMPROMISINGLY DRUNK
BEFORE
AT LAST ONE EVENING I HURRIED TO HIS CABIN FOR I LEARNED THAT
THIS TIME HIS SITUATION WAS SUCH THAT EVEN THE MOST FASTIDIOUS COULD FIND
NO FAULT WITH IT HE WAS TRANQUILLY SERENELY SYMMETRICALLY DRUNK NOT A
HICCUP TO MAR HIS VOICE NOT A CLOUD UPON HIS BRAIN THICK ENOUGH TO
OBSCURE HIS MEMORY
AS I ENTERED HE WAS SITTING UPON AN EMPTY
POWDER KEG WITH A CLAY PIPE IN ONE HAND AND THE OTHER RAISED TO COMMAND
SILENCE
HIS FACE WAS ROUND RED AND VERY SERIOUS HIS THROAT WAS BARE
AND HIS HAIR TUMBLED IN GENERAL APPEARANCE AND COSTUME HE WAS A STALWART
MINER OF THE PERIOD
ON THE PINE TABLE STOOD A CANDLE AND ITS DIM LIGHT
REVEALED THE BOYS SITTING HERE AND THERE ON BUNKS CANDLE BOXES
POWDER KEGS ETC
THEY SAID
SH DON'T SPEAK HE'S GOING TO COMMENCE
THE STORY OF THE OLD RAM
I FOUND A SEAT AT ONCE AND BLAINE SAID
'I DON'T RECKON THEM TIMES WILL EVER COME AGAIN
THERE NEVER WAS A MORE
BULLIER OLD RAM THAN WHAT HE WAS
GRANDFATHER FETCHED HIM FROM ILLINOIS
GOT HIM OF A MAN BY THE NAME OF YATES BILL YATES MAYBE YOU MIGHT HAVE
HEARD OF HIM HIS FATHER WAS A DEACON BAPTIST AND HE WAS A RUSTLER
TOO A MAN HAD TO GET UP RUTHER EARLY TO GET THE START OF OLD THANKFUL
YATES IT WAS HIM THAT PUT THE GREENS UP TO JINING TEAMS WITH MY
GRANDFATHER WHEN HE MOVED WEST
'SETH GREEN WAS PROB'LY THE PICK OF THE FLOCK HE MARRIED A WILKERSON
SARAH WILKERSON GOOD CRETUR SHE WAS ONE OF THE LIKELIEST HEIFERS THAT
WAS EVER RAISED IN OLD STODDARD EVERYBODY SAID THAT KNOWED HER
SHE
COULD HEFT A BAR'L OF FLOUR AS EASY AS I CAN FLIRT A FLAPJACK
AND SPIN
DON'T MENTION IT INDEPENDENT HUMPH WHEN SILE HAWKINS COME A
BROWSING AROUND HER SHE LET HIM KNOW THAT FOR ALL HIS TIN HE COULDN'T
TROT IN HARNESS ALONGSIDE OF HER
YOU SEE SILE HAWKINS WAS NO IT
WARN'T SILE HAWKINS AFTER ALL IT WAS A GALOOT BY THE NAME OF FILKINS
I DISREMEMBER HIS FIRST NAME BUT HE WAS A STUMP COME INTO PRA'R MEETING
DRUNK ONE NIGHT HOORAYING FOR NIXON BECUZ HE THOUGHT IT WAS A PRIMARY
AND OLD DEACON FERGUSON UP AND SCOOTED HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW AND HE LIT
ON OLD MISS JEFFERSON'S HEAD POOR OLD FILLY
SHE WAS A GOOD SOUL HAD A
GLASS EYE AND USED TO LEND IT TO OLD MISS WAGNER THAT HADN'T ANY TO
RECEIVE COMPANY IN IT WARN'T BIG ENOUGH AND WHEN MISS WAGNER WARN'T
NOTICING IT WOULD GET TWISTED AROUND IN THE SOCKET AND LOOK UP MAYBE
OR OUT TO ONE SIDE AND EVERY WHICH WAY WHILE T' OTHER ONE WAS LOOKING
AS STRAIGHT AHEAD AS A SPY GLASS
'GROWN PEOPLE DIDN'T MIND IT BUT IT MOST ALWAYS MADE THE CHILDREN CRY IT
WAS SO SORT OF SCARY
SHE TRIED PACKING IT IN RAW COTTON BUT IT
WOULDN'T WORK SOMEHOW THE COTTON WOULD GET LOOSE AND STICK OUT AND LOOK
SO KIND OF AWFUL THAT THE CHILDREN COULDN'T STAND IT NO WAY
SHE WAS
ALWAYS DROPPING IT OUT AND TURNING UP HER OLD DEAD LIGHT ON THE COMPANY
EMPTY AND MAKING THEM ONCOMFORTABLE BECUZ SHE NEVER COULD TELL WHEN IT
HOPPED OUT BEING BLIND ON THAT SIDE YOU SEE
SO SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO
HUNCH HER AND SAY YOUR GAME EYE HAS FETCHED LOOSE
MISS WAGNER DEAR
AND THEN ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO SIT AND WAIT TILL SHE JAMMED IT IN
AGAIN WRONG SIDE BEFORE AS A GENERAL THING AND GREEN AS A BIRD'S EGG
BEING A BASHFUL CRETUR AND EASY SOT BACK BEFORE COMPANY
BUT BEING WRONG
SIDE BEFORE WARN'T MUCH DIFFERENCE ANYWAY BECUZ HER OWN EYE WAS
SKY BLUE AND THE GLASS ONE WAS YALLER ON THE FRONT SIDE SO WHICHEVER WAY
SHE TURNED IT IT DIDN'T MATCH NOHOW
'OLD MISS WAGNER WAS CONSIDERABLE ON THE BORROW SHE WAS
WHEN SHE HAD A
QUILTING OR DORCAS S'IETY AT HER HOUSE SHE GEN'ALLY BORROWED MISS
HIGGINS'S WOODEN LEG TO STUMP AROUND ON IT WAS CONSIDERABLE SHORTER THAN
HER OTHER PIN BUT MUCH SHE MINDED THAT
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T ABIDE
CRUTCHES WHEN SHE HAD COMPANY BECUZ THEY WERE SO SLOW SAID WHEN SHE HAD
COMPANY AND THINGS HAD TO BE DONE SHE WANTED TO GET UP AND HUMP HERSELF
SHE WAS AS BALD AS A JUG AND SO SHE USED TO BORROW MISS JACOPS'S WIG
MISS JACOPS WAS THE COFFIN PEDDLER'S WIFE A RATTY OLD BUZZARD HE WAS
THAT USED TO GO ROOSTING AROUND WHERE PEOPLE WAS SICK WAITING FOR 'EM
AND THERE THAT OLD RIP WOULD SIT ALL DAY IN THE SHADE ON A COFFIN THAT
HE JUDGED WOULD FIT THE CAN'IDATE AND IF IT WAS A SLOW CUSTOMER AND KIND
OF UNCERTAIN HE'D FETCH HIS RATIONS AND A BLANKET ALONG AND SLEEP IN THE
COFFIN NIGHTS
HE WAS ANCHORED OUT THAT WAY IN FROSTY WEATHER FOR
ABOUT THREE WEEKS ONCE BEFORE OLD ROBBINS'S PLACE WAITING FOR HIM AND
AFTER THAT FOR AS MUCH AS TWO YEARS JACOPS WAS NOT ON SPEAKING TERMS
WITH THE OLD MAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS DISAPP'INTING HIM
HE GOT ONE OF HIS
FEET FROZE AND LOST MONEY TOO BECUZ OLD ROBBINS TOOK A FAVORABLE TURN
AND GOT WELL
THE NEXT TIME ROBBINS GOT SICK JACOPS TRIED TO MAKE UP
WITH HIM AND VARNISHED UP THE SAME OLD COFFIN AND FETCHED IT ALONG BUT
OLD ROBBINS WAS TOO MANY FOR HIM HE HAD HIM IN AND 'PEARED TO BE
POWERFUL WEAK HE BOUGHT THE COFFIN FOR TEN DOLLARS AND JACOPS WAS TO PAY
IT BACK AND TWENTY FIVE MORE BESIDES IF ROBBINS DIDN'T LIKE THE COFFIN
AFTER HE'D TRIED IT
AND THEN ROBBINS DIED AND AT THE FUNERAL HE
BURSTED OFF THE LID AND RIZ UP IN HIS SHROUD AND TOLD THE PARSON TO LET
UP ON THE PERFORMANCES BECUZ HE COULD NOT STAND SUCH A COFFIN AS THAT
YOU SEE HE HAD BEEN IN A TRANCE ONCE BEFORE WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND HE
TOOK THE CHANCES ON ANOTHER CAL'LATING THAT IF HE MADE THE TRIP IT WAS
MONEY IN HIS POCKET AND IF HE MISSED FIRE HE COULDN'T LOSE A CENT
AND
BY GEORGE HE SUED JACOPS FOR THE RHINO AND GOT JEDGMENT AND HE SET UP
THE COFFIN IN HIS BACK PARLOR AND SAID HE 'LOWED TO TAKE HIS TIME NOW
IT WAS ALWAYS AN AGGRAVATION TO JACOPS THE WAY THAT MISERABLE OLD THING
ACTED
HE MOVED BACK TO INDIANY PRETTY SOON WENT TO WELLSVILLE
WELLSVILLE WAS THE PLACE THE HOGADORNS WAS FROM
MIGHTY FINE FAMILY
OLD MARYLAND STOCK
OLD SQUIRE HOGADORN COULD CARRY AROUND MORE MIXED
LICKER AND CUSS BETTER THAN MOST ANY MAN I EVER SEE
HIS SECOND WIFE
WAS THE WIDDER BILLINGS SHE THAT WAS BECKY MARTIN HER DAM WAS DEACON
DUNLAP'S FIRST WIFE
HER OLDEST CHILD MARIA MARRIED A MISSIONARY AND
DIED IN GRACE ET UP BY THE SAVAGES
THEY ET HIM TOO POOR FELLER
BILED HIM
IT WARN'T THE CUSTOM SO THEY SAY BUT THEY EXPLAINED TO
FRIENDS OF HIS'N THAT WENT DOWN THERE TO BRING AWAY HIS THINGS THAT
THEY'D TRIED MISSIONARIES EVERY OTHER WAY AND NEVER COULD GET ANY GOOD
OUT OF 'EM AND SO IT ANNOYED ALL HIS RELATIONS TO FIND OUT THAT THAT
MAN'S LIFE WAS FOOLED AWAY JUST OUT OF A DERN'D EXPERIMENT SO TO SPEAK
BUT MIND YOU THERE AIN'T ANYTHING EVER REELY LOST EVERYTHING THAT
PEOPLE CAN'T UNDERSTAND AND DON'T SEE THE REASON OF DOES GOOD IF YOU ONLY
HOLD ON AND GIVE IT A FAIR SHAKE PROV'DENCE DON'T FIRE NO BLANK
CA'TRIDGES BOYS
THAT THERE MISSIONARY'S SUBSTANCE UNBEKNOWNS TO
HIMSELF ACTU'LY CONVERTED EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM HEATHENS THAT TOOK A
CHANCE AT THE BARBACUE
NOTHING EVER FETCHED THEM BUT THAT
DON'T TELL
ME IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE WAS BILED
THERE AIN'T NO SUCH A THING AS
AN ACCIDENT
'WHEN MY UNCLE LEM WAS LEANING UP AGIN A SCAFFOLDING ONCE SICK OR DRUNK
OR SUTHIN AN IRISHMAN WITH A HOD FULL OF BRICKS FELL ON HIM OUT OF THE
THIRD STORY AND BROKE THE OLD MAN'S BACK IN TWO PLACES
PEOPLE SAID IT
WAS AN ACCIDENT
MUCH ACCIDENT THERE WAS ABOUT THAT
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS THERE FOR BUT HE WAS THERE FOR A GOOD OBJECT
IF HE HADN'T
BEEN THERE THE IRISHMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED
NOBODY CAN EVER MAKE ME
BELIEVE ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM THAT
UNCLE LEM'S DOG WAS THERE
WHY
DIDN'T THE IRISHMAN FALL ON THE DOG BECUZ THE DOG WOULD A SEEN HIM A
COMING AND STOOD FROM UNDER
THAT'S THE REASON THE DOG WARN'T APPINTED
A DOG CAN'T BE DEPENDED ON TO CARRY OUT A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE
MARK MY
WORDS IT WAS A PUT UP THING
ACCIDENTS DON'T HAPPEN BOYS
UNCLE LEM'S
DOG I WISH YOU COULD A SEEN THAT DOG
HE WAS A REGLAR SHEPHERD OR
RUTHER HE WAS PART BULL AND PART SHEPHERD SPLENDID ANIMAL BELONGED TO
PARSON HAGAR BEFORE UNCLE LEM GOT HIM
PARSON HAGAR BELONGED TO THE
WESTERN RESERVE HAGARS PRIME FAMILY HIS MOTHER WAS A WATSON ONE OF HIS
SISTERS MARRIED A WHEELER THEY SETTLED IN MORGAN COUNTY AND HE GOT
NIPPED BY THE MACHINERY IN A CARPET FACTORY AND WENT THROUGH IN LESS THAN
A QUARTER OF A MINUTE HIS WIDDER BOUGHT THE PIECE OF CARPET THAT HAD HIS
REMAINS WOVE IN AND PEOPLE COME A HUNDRED MILE TO 'TEND THE FUNERAL
THERE WAS FOURTEEN YARDS IN THE PIECE
'SHE WOULDN'T LET THEM ROLL HIM UP BUT PLANTED HIM JUST SO FULL LENGTH
THE CHURCH WAS MIDDLING SMALL WHERE THEY PREACHED THE FUNERAL AND THEY
HAD TO LET ONE END OF THE COFFIN STICK OUT OF THE WINDOW
THEY DIDN'T
BURY HIM THEY PLANTED ONE END AND LET HIM STAND UP SAME AS A MONUMENT
AND THEY NAILED A SIGN ON IT AND PUT PUT ON PUT ON IT SACRED TO THE
M E M O R Y OF FOURTEEN Y A R D S OF THREE PLY CAR PET CONTAINING
ALL THAT WAS M O R T A L OF OF W I L L I A M W H E
JIM BLAINE HAD BEEN GROWING GRADUALLY DROWSY AND DROWSIER HIS HEAD
NODDED ONCE TWICE THREE TIMES DROPPED PEACEFULLY UPON HIS BREAST AND
HE FELL TRANQUILLY ASLEEP
THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN THE BOYS' CHEEKS
THEY WERE SUFFOCATING WITH SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER AND HAD BEEN FROM THE
START THOUGH I HAD NEVER NOTICED IT
I PERCEIVED THAT I WAS SOLD
I LEARNED THEN THAT JIM BLAINE'S PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHENEVER HE REACHED
A CERTAIN STAGE OF INTOXICATION NO HUMAN POWER COULD KEEP HIM FROM
SETTING OUT WITH IMPRESSIVE UNCTION TO TELL ABOUT A WONDERFUL ADVENTURE
WHICH HE HAD ONCE HAD WITH HIS GRANDFATHER'S OLD RAM AND THE MENTION OF
THE RAM IN THE FIRST SENTENCE WAS AS FAR AS ANY MAN HAD EVER HEARD HIM
GET CONCERNING IT
HE ALWAYS MAUNDERED OFF INTERMINABLY FROM ONE
THING TO ANOTHER TILL HIS WHISKY GOT THE BEST OF HIM AND HE FELL ASLEEP
WHAT THE THING WAS THAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND HIS GRANDFATHER'S OLD RAM IS
A DARK MYSTERY TO THIS DAY FOR NOBODY HAS EVER YET FOUND OUT
CHAPTER LIV
OF COURSE THERE WAS A LARGE CHINESE POPULATION IN VIRGINIA IT IS THE
CASE WITH EVERY TOWN AND CITY ON THE PACIFIC COAST
THEY ARE A HARMLESS
RACE WHEN WHITE MEN EITHER LET THEM ALONE OR TREAT THEM NO WORSE THAN
DOGS IN FACT THEY ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY HARMLESS ANYHOW FOR THEY SELDOM
THINK OF RESENTING THE VILEST INSULTS OR THE CRUELEST INJURIES
THEY ARE
QUIET PEACEABLE TRACTABLE FREE FROM DRUNKENNESS AND THEY ARE AS
INDUSTRIOUS AS THE DAY IS LONG
A DISORDERLY CHINAMAN IS RARE AND A
LAZY ONE DOES NOT EXIST
SO LONG AS A CHINAMAN HAS STRENGTH TO USE HIS
HANDS HE NEEDS NO SUPPORT FROM ANYBODY WHITE MEN OFTEN COMPLAIN OF WANT
OF WORK BUT A CHINAMAN OFFERS NO SUCH COMPLAINT HE ALWAYS MANAGES TO
FIND SOMETHING TO DO
HE IS A GREAT CONVENIENCE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO
THE WORST CLASS OF WHITE MEN FOR HE BEARS THE MOST OF THEIR SINS
SUFFERING FINES FOR THEIR PETTY THEFTS IMPRISONMENT FOR THEIR ROBBERIES
AND DEATH FOR THEIR MURDERS
ANY WHITE MAN CAN SWEAR A CHINAMAN'S LIFE
AWAY IN THE COURTS BUT NO CHINAMAN CAN TESTIFY AGAINST A WHITE MAN
OURS IS THE LAND OF THE FREE NOBODY DENIES THAT NOBODY CHALLENGES IT
MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE WE WON'T LET OTHER PEOPLE TESTIFY AS I WRITE NEWS
COMES THAT IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN SAN FRANCISCO SOME BOYS HAVE STONED AN
INOFFENSIVE CHINAMAN TO DEATH AND THAT ALTHOUGH A LARGE CROWD WITNESSED
THE SHAMEFUL DEED NO ONE INTERFERED
THERE ARE SEVENTY THOUSAND AND POSSIBLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHINAMEN
ON THE PACIFIC COAST
THERE WERE ABOUT A THOUSAND IN VIRGINIA
THEY
WERE PENNED INTO A CHINESE QUARTER A THING WHICH THEY DO NOT
PARTICULARLY OBJECT TO AS THEY ARE FOND OF HERDING TOGETHER
THEIR
BUILDINGS WERE OF WOOD USUALLY ONLY ONE STORY HIGH AND SET THICKLY
TOGETHER ALONG STREETS SCARCELY WIDE ENOUGH FOR A WAGON TO PASS THROUGH
THEIR QUARTER WAS A LITTLE REMOVED FROM THE REST OF THE TOWN
THE CHIEF
EMPLOYMENT OF CHINAMEN IN TOWNS IS TO WASH CLOTHING
THEY ALWAYS SEND A
BILL LIKE THIS BELOW PINNED TO THE CLOTHES
IT IS MERE CEREMONY FOR
IT DOES NOT ENLIGHTEN THE CUSTOMER MUCH
THEIR PRICE FOR WASHING WAS
2 50 PER DOZEN RATHER CHEAPER THAN WHITE PEOPLE COULD AFFORD TO WASH
FOR AT THAT TIME
A VERY COMMON SIGN ON THE CHINESE HOUSES WAS SEE
YUP WASHER AND IRONER HONG WO WASHER SAM SING AH HOP WASHING
THE HOUSE SERVANTS COOKS ETC IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA WERE CHIEFLY
CHINAMEN
THERE WERE FEW WHITE SERVANTS AND NO CHINAWOMEN SO EMPLOYED
CHINAMEN MAKE GOOD HOUSE SERVANTS BEING QUICK OBEDIENT PATIENT QUICK
TO LEARN AND TIRELESSLY INDUSTRIOUS
THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE TAUGHT A
THING TWICE AS A GENERAL THING
THEY ARE IMITATIVE
IF A CHINAMAN WERE
TO SEE HIS MASTER BREAK UP A CENTRE TABLE IN A PASSION AND KINDLE A
FIRE WITH IT THAT CHINAMAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO RESORT TO THE FURNITURE
FOR FUEL FOREVER AFTERWARD
ALL CHINAMEN CAN READ WRITE AND CIPHER WITH EASY FACILITY PITY BUT ALL
OUR PETTED VOTERS COULD
IN CALIFORNIA THEY RENT LITTLE PATCHES OF
GROUND AND DO A DEAL OF GARDENING
THEY WILL RAISE SURPRISING CROPS OF
VEGETABLES ON A SAND PILE
THEY WASTE NOTHING
WHAT IS RUBBISH TO A
CHRISTIAN A CHINAMAN CAREFULLY PRESERVES AND MAKES USEFUL IN ONE WAY OR
ANOTHER
HE GATHERS UP ALL THE OLD OYSTER AND SARDINE CANS THAT WHITE
PEOPLE THROW AWAY AND PROCURES MARKETABLE TIN AND SOLDER FROM THEM BY
MELTING
HE GATHERS UP OLD BONES AND TURNS THEM INTO MANURE
IN CALIFORNIA HE GETS A LIVING OUT OF OLD MINING CLAIMS THAT WHITE MEN
HAVE ABANDONED AS EXHAUSTED AND WORTHLESS AND THEN THE OFFICERS COME
DOWN ON HIM ONCE A MONTH WITH AN EXORBITANT SWINDLE TO WHICH THE
LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN THE BROAD GENERAL NAME OF FOREIGN MINING TAX
BUT IT IS USUALLY INFLICTED ON NO FOREIGNERS BUT CHINAMEN
THIS SWINDLE
HAS IN SOME CASES BEEN REPEATED ONCE OR TWICE ON THE SAME VICTIM IN THE
COURSE OF THE SAME MONTH BUT THE PUBLIC TREASURY WAS NO ADDITIONALLY
ENRICHED BY IT PROBABLY
CHINAMEN HOLD THEIR DEAD IN GREAT REVERENCE THEY WORSHIP THEIR DEPARTED
ANCESTORS IN FACT
HENCE IN CHINA A MAN'S FRONT YARD BACK YARD OR
ANY OTHER PART OF HIS PREMISES IS MADE HIS FAMILY BURYING GROUND IN
ORDER THAT HE MAY VISIT THE GRAVES AT ANY AND ALL TIMES
THEREFORE THAT
HUGE EMPIRE IS ONE MIGHTY CEMETERY IT IS RIDGED AND WRINGLED FROM ITS
CENTRE TO ITS CIRCUMFERENCE WITH GRAVES AND INASMUCH AS EVERY FOOT OF
GROUND MUST BE MADE TO DO ITS UTMOST IN CHINA LEST THE SWARMING
POPULATION SUFFER FOR FOOD THE VERY GRAVES ARE CULTIVATED AND YIELD A
HARVEST CUSTOM HOLDING THIS TO BE NO DISHONOR TO THE DEAD
SINCE THE
DEPARTED ARE HELD IN SUCH WORSHIPFUL REVERENCE A CHINAMAN CANNOT BEAR
THAT ANY INDIGNITY BE OFFERED THE PLACES WHERE THEY SLEEP
MR
BURLINGAME SAID THAT HEREIN LAY CHINA'S BITTER OPPOSITION TO
RAILROADS A ROAD COULD NOT BE BUILT ANYWHERE IN THE EMPIRE WITHOUT
DISTURBING THE GRAVES OF THEIR ANCESTORS OR FRIENDS
A CHINAMAN HARDLY BELIEVES HE COULD ENJOY THE HEREAFTER EXCEPT HIS BODY
LAY IN HIS BELOVED CHINA ALSO HE DESIRES TO RECEIVE HIMSELF AFTER
DEATH THAT WORSHIP WITH WHICH HE HAS HONORED HIS DEAD THAT PRECEDED HIM
THEREFORE IF HE VISITS A FOREIGN COUNTRY HE MAKES ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE
HIS BONES RETURNED TO CHINA IN CASE HE DIES IF HE HIRES TO GO TO A
FOREIGN COUNTRY ON A LABOR CONTRACT THERE IS ALWAYS A STIPULATION THAT
HIS BODY SHALL BE TAKEN BACK TO CHINA IF HE DIES IF THE GOVERNMENT SELLS
A GANG OF COOLIES TO A FOREIGNER FOR THE USUAL FIVE YEAR TERM IT IS
SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT THAT THEIR BODIES SHALL BE RESTORED TO CHINA IN
CASE OF DEATH
ON THE PACIFIC COAST THE CHINAMEN ALL BELONG TO ONE OR
ANOTHER OF SEVERAL GREAT COMPANIES OR ORGANIZATIONS AND THESE COMPANIES
KEEP TRACK OF THEIR MEMBERS REGISTER THEIR NAMES AND SHIP THEIR BODIES
HOME WHEN THEY DIE
THE SEE YUP COMPANY IS HELD TO BE THE LARGEST OF
THESE
THE NING YEONG COMPANY IS NEXT AND NUMBERS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND
MEMBERS ON THE COAST
ITS HEADQUARTERS ARE AT SAN FRANCISCO WHERE IT
HAS A COSTLY TEMPLE SEVERAL GREAT OFFICERS ONE OF WHOM KEEPS REGAL
STATE IN SECLUSION AND CANNOT BE APPROACHED BY COMMON HUMANITY AND A
NUMEROUS PRIESTHOOD
IN IT I WAS SHOWN A REGISTER OF ITS MEMBERS WITH
THE DEAD AND THE DATE OF THEIR SHIPMENT TO CHINA DULY MARKED
EVERY SHIP
THAT SAILS FROM SAN FRANCISCO CARRIES AWAY A HEAVY FREIGHT OF CHINESE
CORPSES OR DID AT LEAST UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE WITH AN INGENIOUS
REFINEMENT OF CHRISTIAN CRUELTY FORBADE THE SHIPMENTS AS A NEAT
UNDERHANDED WAY OF DETERRING CHINESE IMMIGRATION
THE BILL WAS OFFERED
WHETHER IT PASSED OR NOT
IT IS MY IMPRESSION THAT IT PASSED
THERE WAS
ANOTHER BILL IT BECAME A LAW COMPELLING EVERY INCOMING CHINAMAN TO BE
VACCINATED ON THE WHARF AND PAY A DULY APPOINTED QUACK NO DECENT DOCTOR
WOULD DEFILE HIMSELF WITH SUCH LEGALIZED ROBBERY TEN DOLLARS FOR IT
AS FEW IMPORTERS OF CHINESE WOULD WANT TO GO TO AN EXPENSE LIKE THAT THE
LAW MAKERS THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER HEAVY BLOW TO CHINESE
IMMIGRATION
WHAT THE CHINESE QUARTER OF VIRGINIA WAS LIKE OR INDEED WHAT THE
CHINESE QUARTER OF ANY PACIFIC COAST TOWN WAS AND IS LIKE MAY BE
GATHERED FROM THIS ITEM WHICH I PRINTED IN THE ENTERPRISE WHILE REPORTING
FOR THAT PAPER
CHINATOWN ACCOMPANIED BY A FELLOW REPORTER WE MADE A TRIP THROUGH
OUR CHINESE QUARTER THE OTHER NIGHT
THE CHINESE HAVE BUILT THEIR
PORTION OF THE CITY TO SUIT THEMSELVES AND AS THEY KEEP NEITHER
CARRIAGES NOR WAGONS THEIR STREETS ARE NOT WIDE ENOUGH AS A
GENERAL THING TO ADMIT OF THE PASSAGE OF VEHICLES
AT TEN O'CLOCK
AT NIGHT THE CHINAMAN MAY BE SEEN IN ALL HIS GLORY
IN EVERY LITTLE
COOPED UP DINGY CAVERN OF A HUT FAINT WITH THE ODOR OF BURNING
JOSH LIGHTS AND WITH NOTHING TO SEE THE GLOOM BY SAVE THE SICKLY
GUTTERING TALLOW CANDLE WERE TWO OR THREE YELLOW LONG TAILED
VAGABONDS COILED UP ON A SORT OF SHORT TRUCKLE BED SMOKING OPIUM
MOTIONLESS AND WITH THEIR LUSTRELESS EYES TURNED INWARD FROM EXCESS
OF SATISFACTION OR RATHER THE RECENT SMOKER LOOKS THUS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER HAVING PASSED THE PIPE TO HIS NEIGHBOR FOR OPIUM SMOKING IS A
COMFORTLESS OPERATION AND REQUIRES CONSTANT ATTENTION
A LAMP SITS
ON THE BED THE LENGTH OF THE LONG PIPE STEM FROM THE SMOKER'S
MOUTH HE PUTS A PELLET OF OPIUM ON THE END OF A WIRE SETS IT ON
FIRE AND PLASTERS IT INTO THE PIPE MUCH AS A CHRISTIAN WOULD FILL A
HOLE WITH PUTTY THEN HE APPLIES THE BOWL TO THE LAMP AND PROCEEDS
TO SMOKE AND THE STEWING AND FRYING OF THE DRUG AND THE GURGLING OF
THE JUICES IN THE STEM WOULD WELL NIGH TURN THE STOMACH OF A STATUE
JOHN LIKES IT THOUGH IT SOOTHES HIM HE TAKES ABOUT TWO DOZEN
WHIFFS AND THEN ROLLS OVER TO DREAM HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHAT FOR WE
COULD NOT IMAGINE BY LOOKING AT THE SOGGY CREATURE
POSSIBLY IN HIS
VISIONS HE TRAVELS FAR AWAY FROM THE GROSS WORLD AND HIS REGULAR
WASHING AND FEAST ON SUCCULENT RATS AND BIRDS' NESTS IN PARADISE
MR
AH SING KEEPS A GENERAL GROCERY AND PROVISION STORE AT NO
13 WANG
STREET
HE LAVISHED HIS HOSPITALITY UPON OUR PARTY IN THE FRIENDLIEST
WAY
HE HAD VARIOUS KINDS OF COLORED AND COLORLESS WINES AND BRANDIES
WITH UNPRONOUNCABLE NAMES IMPORTED FROM CHINA IN LITTLE CROCKERY JUGS
AND WHICH HE OFFERED TO US IN DAINTY LITTLE MINIATURE WASH BASINS OF
PORCELAIN
HE OFFERED US A MESS OF BIRDS' NESTS ALSO SMALL NEAT
SAUSAGES OF WHICH WE COULD HAVE SWALLOWED SEVERAL YARDS IF WE HAD CHOSEN
TO TRY BUT WE SUSPECTED THAT EACH LINK CONTAINED THE CORPSE OF A MOUSE
AND THEREFORE REFRAINED
MR
SING HAD IN HIS STORE A THOUSAND ARTICLES
OF MERCHANDISE CURIOUS TO BEHOLD IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THE USES OF AND
BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO DESCRIBE
HIS DUCKS HOWEVER AND HIS EGGS WE COULD UNDERSTAND THE FORMER WERE
SPLIT OPEN AND FLATTENED OUT LIKE CODFISH AND CAME FROM CHINA IN THAT
SHAPE AND THE LATTER WERE PLASTERED OVER WITH SOME KIND OF PASTE WHICH
KEPT THEM FRESH AND PALATABLE THROUGH THE LONG VOYAGE
WE FOUND MR
HONG WO NO
37 CHOW CHOW STREET MAKING UP A LOTTERY
SCHEME IN FACT WE FOUND A DOZEN OTHERS OCCUPIED IN THE SAME WAY IN
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE QUARTER FOR ABOUT EVERY THIRD CHINAMAN RUNS A
LOTTERY AND THE BALANCE OF THE TRIBE BUCK AT IT
TOM WHO SPEAKS
FAULTLESS ENGLISH AND USED TO BE CHIEF AND ONLY COOK TO THE TERRITORIAL
ENTERPRISE WHEN THE ESTABLISHMENT KEPT BACHELOR'S HALL TWO YEARS AGO
SAID THAT SOMETIME CHINAMAN BUY TICKET ONE DOLLAR HAP KETCH UM TWO TREE
HUNDRED SOMETIME NO KETCH UM ANYTHING LOTTERY LIKE ONE MAN FIGHT UM
SEVENTY MAY BE HE WHIP MAY BE HE GET WHIP HESELF WELLY GOOD
HOWEVER THE PERCENTAGE BEING SIXTY NINE AGAINST HIM THE CHANCES ARE
AS A GENERAL THING THAT HE GET WHIP HESELF WE COULD NOT SEE THAT
THESE LOTTERIES DIFFERED IN ANY RESPECT FROM OUR OWN SAVE THAT THE
FIGURES BEING CHINESE NO IGNORANT WHITE MAN MIGHT EVER HOPE TO SUCCEED
IN TELLING T'OTHER FROM WHICH THE MANNER OF DRAWING IS SIMILAR TO
OURS
MR
SEE YUP KEEPS A FANCY STORE ON LIVE FOX STREET
HE SOLD US FANS OF
WHITE FEATHERS GORGEOUSLY ORNAMENTED PERFUMERY THAT SMELLED LIKE
LIMBURGER CHEESE CHINESE PENS AND WATCH CHARMS MADE OF A STONE
UNSCRATCHABLE WITH STEEL INSTRUMENTS YET POLISHED AND TINTED LIKE THE
INNER COAT OF A SEA SHELL
AS TOKENS OF HIS ESTEEM SEE YUP PRESENTED
THE PARTY WITH GAUDY PLUMES MADE OF GOLD TINSEL AND TRIMMED WITH
PEACOCKS' FEATHERS
WE ATE CHOW CHOW WITH CHOP STICKS IN THE CELESTIAL RESTAURANTS OUR
COMRADE CHIDED THE MOON EYED DAMSELS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSES FOR THEIR
WANT OF FEMININE RESERVE WE RECEIVED PROTECTING JOSH LIGHTS FROM OUR
HOSTS AND DICKERED FOR A PAGAN GOD OR TWO
FINALLY WE WERE IMPRESSED
WITH THE GENIUS OF A CHINESE BOOK KEEPER HE FIGURED UP HIS ACCOUNTS ON A
MACHINE LIKE A GRIDIRON WITH BUTTONS STRUNG ON ITS BARS THE DIFFERENT
ROWS REPRESENTED UNITS TENS HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS
HE FINGERED THEM
WITH INCREDIBLE RAPIDITY IN FACT HE PUSHED THEM FROM PLACE TO PLACE AS
FAST AS A MUSICAL PROFESSOR'S FINGERS TRAVEL OVER THE KEYS OF A PIANO
THEY ARE A KINDLY DISPOSED WELL MEANING RACE AND ARE RESPECTED AND WELL
TREATED BY THE UPPER CLASSES ALL OVER THE PACIFIC COAST
NO CALIFORNIAN
GENTLEMAN OR LADY EVER ABUSES OR OPPRESSES A CHINAMAN UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES AN EXPLANATION THAT SEEMS TO BE MUCH NEEDED IN THE EAST
ONLY THE SCUM OF THE POPULATION DO IT THEY AND THEIR CHILDREN THEY
AND NATURALLY AND CONSISTENTLY THE POLICEMEN AND POLITICIANS LIKEWISE
FOR THESE ARE THE DUST LICKING PIMPS AND SLAVES OF THE SCUM THERE AS
WELL AS ELSEWHERE IN AMERICA
CHAPTER LV
I BEGAN TO GET TIRED OF STAYING IN ONE PLACE SO LONG
THERE WAS NO LONGER SATISFYING VARIETY IN GOING DOWN TO CARSON TO REPORT
THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE ONCE A YEAR AND HORSE RACES AND
PUMPKIN SHOWS ONCE IN THREE MONTHS THEY HAD GOT TO RAISING PUMPKINS AND
POTATOES IN WASHOE VALLEY AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE FIRST ACHIEVEMENTS OF
THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO INSTITUTE A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR AGRICULTURAL FAIR
TO SHOW OFF FORTY DOLLARS' WORTH OF THOSE PUMPKINS IN HOWEVER THE
TERRITORIAL LEGISLATURE WAS USUALLY SPOKEN OF AS THE ASYLUM
I WANTED
TO SEE SAN FRANCISCO
I WANTED TO GO SOMEWHERE
I WANTED I DID NOT
KNOW WHAT I WANTED
I HAD THE SPRING FEVER AND WANTED A CHANGE
PRINCIPALLY NO DOUBT
BESIDES A CONVENTION HAD FRAMED A STATE
CONSTITUTION NINE MEN OUT OF EVERY TEN WANTED AN OFFICE I BELIEVED THAT
THESE GENTLEMEN WOULD TREAT THE MONEYLESS AND THE IRRESPONSIBLE AMONG
THE POPULATION INTO ADOPTING THE CONSTITUTION AND THUS WELL NIGH KILLING
THE COUNTRY IT COULD NOT WELL CARRY SUCH A LOAD AS A STATE GOVERNMENT
SINCE IT HAD NOTHING TO TAX THAT COULD STAND A TAX FOR UNDEVELOPED MINES
COULD NOT AND THERE WERE NOT FIFTY DEVELOPED ONES IN THE LAND THERE WAS
BUT LITTLE REALTY TO TAX AND IT DID SEEM AS IF NOBODY WAS EVER GOING TO
THINK OF THE SIMPLE SALVATION OF INFLICTING A MONEY PENALTY ON MURDER
I BELIEVED THAT A STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD DESTROY THE FLUSH TIMES AND I
WANTED TO GET AWAY
I BELIEVED THAT THE MINING STOCKS I HAD ON HAND
WOULD SOON BE WORTH 100 000 AND THOUGHT IF THEY REACHED THAT BEFORE THE
CONSTITUTION WAS ADOPTED I WOULD SELL OUT AND MAKE MYSELF SECURE FROM
THE CRASH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT WAS GOING TO BRING
I CONSIDERED
100 000 SUFFICIENT TO GO HOME WITH DECENTLY THOUGH IT WAS BUT A SMALL
AMOUNT COMPARED TO WHAT I HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO RETURN WITH
I FELT
RATHER DOWN HEARTED ABOUT IT BUT I TRIED TO COMFORT MYSELF WITH THE
REFLECTION THAT WITH SUCH A SUM I COULD NOT FALL INTO WANT
ABOUT THIS
TIME A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE WHOM I HAD NOT SEEN SINCE BOYHOOD CAME
TRAMPING IN ON FOOT FROM REESE RIVER A VERY ALLEGORY OF POVERTY
THE SON OF WEALTHY PARENTS HERE HE WAS IN A STRANGE LAND HUNGRY
BOOTLESS MANTLED IN AN ANCIENT HORSE BLANKET ROOFED WITH A BRIMLESS
HAT AND SO GENERALLY AND SO EXTRAVAGANTLY DILAPIDATED THAT HE COULD HAVE
TAKEN THE SHINE OUT OF THE PRODIGAL SON HIMSELF AS HE PLEASANTLY
REMARKED
HE WANTED TO BORROW FORTY SIX DOLLARS TWENTY SIX TO TAKE HIM TO SAN
FRANCISCO AND TWENTY FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO BUY SOME SOAP WITH MAYBE
FOR HE NEEDED IT
I FOUND I HAD BUT LITTLE MORE THAN THE AMOUNT WANTED
IN MY POCKET SO I STEPPED IN AND BORROWED FORTY SIX DOLLARS OF A BANKER
ON TWENTY DAYS' TIME WITHOUT THE FORMALITY OF A NOTE AND GAVE IT HIM
RATHER THAN WALK HALF A BLOCK TO THE OFFICE WHERE I HAD SOME SPECIE LAID
UP
IF ANYBODY HAD TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD TAKE ME TWO YEARS TO PAY BACK
THAT FORTY SIX DOLLARS TO THE BANKER FOR I DID NOT EXPECT IT OF THE
PRODIGAL AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED I WOULD HAVE FELT INJURED
AND SO
WOULD THE BANKER
I WANTED A CHANGE
I WANTED VARIETY OF SOME KIND
IT CAME
MR
GOODMAN
WENT AWAY FOR A WEEK AND LEFT ME THE POST OF CHIEF EDITOR
IT DESTROYED
ME
THE FIRST DAY I WROTE MY LEADER IN THE FORENOON
THE SECOND DAY
I HAD NO SUBJECT AND PUT IT OFF TILL THE AFTERNOON
THE THIRD DAY I PUT
IT OFF TILL EVENING AND THEN COPIED AN ELABORATE EDITORIAL OUT OF THE
AMERICAN CYCLOPEDIA THAT STEADFAST FRIEND OF THE EDITOR ALL OVER THIS
LAND
THE FOURTH DAY I FOOLED AROUND TILL MIDNIGHT AND THEN FELL BACK
ON THE CYCLOPEDIA AGAIN
THE FIFTH DAY I CUDGELED MY BRAIN TILL
MIDNIGHT AND THEN KEPT THE PRESS WAITING WHILE I PENNED SOME BITTER
PERSONALITIES ON SIX DIFFERENT PEOPLE
THE SIXTH DAY I LABORED IN
ANGUISH TILL FAR INTO THE NIGHT AND BROUGHT FORTH NOTHING
THE PAPER
WENT TO PRESS WITHOUT AN EDITORIAL
THE SEVENTH DAY I RESIGNED
ON THE
EIGHTH MR
GOODMAN RETURNED AND FOUND SIX DUELS ON HIS HANDS MY
PERSONALITIES HAD BORNE FRUIT
NOBODY EXCEPT HE HAS TRIED IT KNOWS WHAT IT IS TO BE AN EDITOR
IT IS
EASY TO SCRIBBLE LOCAL RUBBISH WITH THE FACTS ALL BEFORE YOU IT IS EASY
TO CLIP SELECTIONS FROM OTHER PAPERS IT IS EASY TO STRING OUT A
CORRESPONDENCE FROM ANY LOCALITY BUT IT IS UNSPEAKABLE HARDSHIP TO WRITE
EDITORIALS
SUBJECTS ARE THE TROUBLE THE DREARY LACK OF THEM I MEAN
EVERY DAY IT IS DRAG DRAG DRAG THINK AND WORRY AND SUFFER ALL THE
WORLD IS A DULL BLANK AND YET THE EDITORIAL COLUMNS MUST BE FILLED
ONLY GIVE THE EDITOR A SUBJECT AND HIS WORK IS DONE IT IS NO TROUBLE TO
WRITE IT UP BUT FANCY HOW YOU WOULD FEEL IF YOU HAD TO PUMP YOUR BRAINS
DRY EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK FIFTY TWO WEEKS IN THE YEAR
IT MAKES ONE LOW
SPIRITED SIMPLY TO THINK OF IT
THE MATTER THAT EACH EDITOR OF A DAILY
PAPER IN AMERICA WRITES IN THE COURSE OF A YEAR WOULD FILL FROM FOUR TO
EIGHT BULKY VOLUMES LIKE THIS BOOK FANCY WHAT A LIBRARY AN EDITOR'S
WORK WOULD MAKE AFTER TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS' SERVICE
YET PEOPLE OFTEN
MARVEL THAT DICKENS SCOTT BULWER DUMAS ETC HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
PRODUCE SO MANY BOOKS
IF THESE AUTHORS HAD WROUGHT AS VOLUMINOUSLY AS
NEWSPAPER EDITORS DO THE RESULT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO MARVEL AT INDEED
HOW EDITORS CAN CONTINUE THIS TREMENDOUS LABOR THIS EXHAUSTING
CONSUMPTION OF BRAIN FIBRE FOR THEIR WORK IS CREATIVE AND NOT A MERE
MECHANICAL LAYING UP OF FACTS LIKE REPORTING DAY AFTER DAY AND YEAR
AFTER YEAR IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE
PREACHERS TAKE TWO MONTHS' HOLIDAY IN
MIDSUMMER FOR THEY FIND THAT TO PRODUCE TWO SERMONS A WEEK IS WEARING
IN THE LONG RUN
IN TRUTH IT MUST BE SO AND IS SO AND THEREFORE HOW
AN EDITOR CAN TAKE FROM TEN TO TWENTY TEXTS AND BUILD UPON THEM FROM TEN
TO TWENTY PAINSTAKING EDITORIALS A WEEK AND KEEP IT UP ALL THE YEAR
ROUND IS FARTHER BEYOND COMPREHENSION THAN EVER
EVER SINCE I SURVIVED
MY WEEK AS EDITOR I HAVE FOUND AT LEAST ONE PLEASURE IN ANY NEWSPAPER
THAT COMES TO MY HAND IT IS IN ADMIRING THE LONG COLUMNS OF EDITORIAL
AND WONDERING TO MYSELF HOW IN THE MISCHIEF HE DID IT
MR
GOODMAN'S RETURN RELIEVED ME OF EMPLOYMENT UNLESS I CHOSE TO BECOME
A REPORTER AGAIN
I COULD NOT DO THAT I COULD NOT SERVE IN THE RANKS
AFTER BEING GENERAL OF THE ARMY
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD DEPART AND GO
ABROAD INTO THE WORLD SOMEWHERE
JUST AT THIS JUNCTURE DAN MY
ASSOCIATE IN THE REPORTORIAL DEPARTMENT TOLD ME CASUALLY THAT TWO
CITIZENS HAD BEEN TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO GO WITH THEM TO NEW YORK AND
AID IN SELLING A RICH SILVER MINE WHICH THEY HAD DISCOVERED AND SECURED
IN A NEW MINING DISTRICT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
HE SAID THEY OFFERED TO
PAY HIS EXPENSES AND GIVE HIM ONE THIRD OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE
HE HAD REFUSED TO GO
IT WAS THE VERY OPPORTUNITY I WANTED
I ABUSED
HIM FOR KEEPING SO QUIET ABOUT IT AND NOT MENTIONING IT SOONER
HE SAID
IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GO AND SO HE HAD
RECOMMENDED THEM TO APPLY TO MARSHALL THE REPORTER OF THE OTHER PAPER
I ASKED DAN IF IT WAS A GOOD HONEST MINE AND NO SWINDLE
HE SAID THE
MEN HAD SHOWN HIM NINE TONS OF THE ROCK WHICH THEY HAD GOT OUT TO TAKE
TO NEW YORK AND HE COULD CHEERFULLY SAY THAT HE HAD SEEN BUT LITTLE ROCK
IN NEVADA THAT WAS RICHER AND MOREOVER HE SAID THAT THEY HAD SECURED A
TRACT OF VALUABLE TIMBER AND A MILL SITE NEAR THE MINE
MY FIRST IDEA
WAS TO KILL DAN
BUT I CHANGED MY MIND NOTWITHSTANDING I WAS SO ANGRY
FOR I THOUGHT MAYBE THE CHANCE WAS NOT YET LOST
DAN SAID IT WAS BY NO
MEANS LOST THAT THE MEN WERE ABSENT AT THE MINE AGAIN AND WOULD NOT BE
IN VIRGINIA TO LEAVE FOR THE EAST FOR SOME TEN DAYS THAT THEY HAD
REQUESTED HIM TO DO THE TALKING TO MARSHALL AND HE HAD PROMISED THAT HE
WOULD EITHER SECURE MARSHALL OR SOMEBODY ELSE FOR THEM BY THE TIME THEY
GOT BACK HE WOULD NOW SAY NOTHING TO ANYBODY TILL THEY RETURNED AND
THEN FULFIL HIS PROMISE BY FURNISHING ME TO THEM
IT WAS SPLENDID
I WENT TO BED ALL ON FIRE WITH EXCITEMENT FOR NOBODY
HAD YET GONE EAST TO SELL A NEVADA SILVER MINE AND THE FIELD WAS WHITE
FOR THE SICKLE
I FELT THAT SUCH A MINE AS THE ONE DESCRIBED BY DAN
WOULD BRING A PRINCELY SUM IN NEW YORK AND SELL WITHOUT DELAY OR
DIFFICULTY
I COULD NOT SLEEP MY FANCY SO RIOTED THROUGH ITS CASTLES IN
THE AIR
IT WAS THE BLIND LEAD COME AGAIN
NEXT DAY I GOT AWAY ON THE COACH WITH THE USUAL ECLAT ATTENDING
DEPARTURES OF OLD CITIZENS FOR IF YOU HAVE ONLY HALF A DOZEN FRIENDS
OUT THERE THEY WILL MAKE NOISE FOR A HUNDRED RATHER THAN LET YOU SEEM TO
GO AWAY NEGLECTED AND UNREGRETTED AND DAN PROMISED TO KEEP STRICT WATCH
FOR THE MEN THAT HAD THE MINE TO SELL
THE TRIP WAS SIGNALIZED BUT BY ONE LITTLE INCIDENT AND THAT OCCURRED
JUST AS WE WERE ABOUT TO START
A VERY SEEDY LOOKING VAGABOND PASSENGER
GOT OUT OF THE STAGE A MOMENT TO WAIT TILL THE USUAL BALLAST OF SILVER
BRICKS WAS THROWN IN
HE WAS STANDING ON THE PAVEMENT WHEN AN AWKWARD
EXPRESS EMPLOYEE CARRYING A BRICK WEIGHING A HUNDRED POUNDS STUMBLED
AND LET IT FALL ON THE BUMMER'S FOOT
HE INSTANTLY DROPPED ON THE GROUND
AND BEGAN TO HOWL IN THE MOST HEART BREAKING WAY
A SYMPATHIZING CROWD
GATHERED AROUND AND WERE GOING TO PULL HIS BOOT OFF BUT HE SCREAMED
LOUDER THAN EVER AND THEY DESISTED THEN HE FELL TO GASPING AND BETWEEN
THE GASPS EJACULATED BRANDY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE BRANDY THEY POURED
HALF A PINT DOWN HIM AND IT WONDERFULLY RESTORED AND COMFORTED HIM
THEN HE BEGGED THE PEOPLE TO ASSIST HIM TO THE STAGE WHICH WAS DONE
THE EXPRESS PEOPLE URGED HIM TO HAVE A DOCTOR AT THEIR EXPENSE BUT HE
DECLINED AND SAID THAT IF HE ONLY HAD A LITTLE BRANDY TO TAKE ALONG WITH
HIM TO SOOTHE HIS PAROXYMS OF PAIN WHEN THEY CAME ON HE WOULD BE
GRATEFUL AND CONTENT
HE WAS QUICKLY SUPPLIED WITH TWO BOTTLES AND WE
DROVE OFF
HE WAS SO SMILING AND HAPPY AFTER THAT THAT I COULD NOT
REFRAIN FROM ASKING HIM HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY BE SO COMFORTABLE WITH A
CRUSHED FOOT
WELL SAID HE I HADN'T HAD A DRINK FOR TWELVE HOURS AND HADN'T A
CENT TO MY NAME
I WAS MOST PERISHING AND SO WHEN THAT DUFFER DROPPED
THAT HUNDRED POUNDER ON MY FOOT I SEE MY CHANCE
GOT A CORK LEG YOU
KNOW AND HE PULLED UP HIS PANTALOONS AND PROVED IT
HE WAS AS DRUNK AS A LORD ALL DAY LONG AND FULL OF CHUCKLINGS OVER HIS
TIMELY INGENUITY
ONE DRUNKEN MAN NECESSARILY REMINDS ONE OF ANOTHER
I ONCE HEARD A
GENTLEMAN TELL ABOUT AN INCIDENT WHICH HE WITNESSED IN A CALIFORNIAN
BAR ROOM
HE ENTITLED IT YE MODEST MAN TAKETH A DRINK IT WAS NOTHING
BUT A BIT OF ACTING BUT IT SEEMED TO ME A PERFECT RENDERING AND WORTHY
OF TOODLES HIMSELF
THE MODEST MAN TOLERABLY FAR GONE WITH BEER AND
OTHER MATTERS ENTERS A SALOON TWENTY FIVE CENTS IS THE PRICE FOR
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING AND SPECIE THE ONLY MONEY USED AND LAYS DOWN A
HALF DOLLAR CALLS FOR WHISKEY AND DRINKS IT THE BAR KEEPER MAKES CHANGE
AND LAYS THE QUARTER IN A WET PLACE ON THE COUNTER THE MODEST MAN
FUMBLES AT IT WITH NERVELESS FINGERS BUT IT SLIPS AND THE WATER HOLDS
IT HE CONTEMPLATES IT AND TRIES AGAIN SAME RESULT OBSERVES THAT
PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN WHAT HE IS AT BLUSHES FUMBLES AT THE QUARTER
AGAIN BLUSHES PUTS HIS FOREFINGER CAREFULLY SLOWLY DOWN TO MAKE SURE
OF HIS AIM PUSHES THE COIN TOWARD THE BAR KEEPER AND SAYS WITH A SIGH
GIMME A CIGAR
NATURALLY ANOTHER GENTLEMAN PRESENT TOLD ABOUT ANOTHER DRUNKEN MAN
HE
SAID HE REELED TOWARD HOME LATE AT NIGHT MADE A MISTAKE AND ENTERED THE
WRONG GATE THOUGHT HE SAW A DOG ON THE STOOP AND IT WAS AN IRON ONE
HE STOPPED AND CONSIDERED WONDERED IF IT WAS A DANGEROUS DOG VENTURED
TO SAY BE HIC BEGONE NO EFFECT
THEN HE APPROACHED WARILY AND
ADOPTED CONCILIATION PURSED UP HIS LIPS AND TRIED TO WHISTLE BUT
FAILED STILL APPROACHED SAYING POOR DOG DOGGY DOGGY DOGGY POOR
DOGGY DOG GOT UP ON THE STOOP STILL PETTING WITH FOND NAMES TILL
MASTER OF THE ADVANTAGES THEN EXCLAIMED LEAVE YOU THIEF PLANTED A
VINDICTIVE KICK IN HIS RIBS AND WENT HEAD OVER HEELS OVERBOARD OF
COURSE
A PAUSE A SIGH OR TWO OF PAIN AND THEN A REMARK IN A
REFLECTIVE VOICE
AWFUL SOLID DOG
WHAT COULD HE BEN EATING 'IC ROCKS P'RAPS
SUCH ANIMALS IS DANGEROUS AT'S WHAT I SAY THEY'RE DANGEROUS
IF A
MAN 'IC IF A MAN WANTS TO FEED A DOG ON ROCKS LET HIM FEED HIM ON
ROCKS 'AT'S ALL RIGHT BUT LET HIM KEEP HIM AT HOME NOT HAVE HIM LAYIN'
ROUND PROMISCUOUS WHERE 'IC WHERE PEOPLE'S LIABLE TO STUMBLE OVER HIM
WHEN THEY AIN'T NOTICIN'
IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE TINY FLAG IT
WAS THIRTY FIVE FEET LONG AND TEN FEET WIDE FLUTTERING LIKE A LADY'S
HANDKERCHIEF FROM THE TOPMOST PEAK OF MOUNT DAVIDSON TWO THOUSAND FEET
ABOVE VIRGINIA'S ROOFS AND FELT THAT DOUBTLESS I WAS BIDDING A PERMANENT
FAREWELL TO A CITY WHICH HAD AFFORDED ME THE MOST VIGOROUS ENJOYMENT OF
LIFE I HAD EVER EXPERIENCED
AND THIS REMINDS ME OF AN INCIDENT WHICH
THE DULLEST MEMORY VIRGINIA COULD BOAST AT THE TIME IT HAPPENED MUST
VIVIDLY RECALL AT TIMES TILL ITS POSSESSOR DIES
LATE ONE SUMMER
AFTERNOON WE HAD A RAIN SHOWER
THAT WAS ASTONISHING ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO SET THE WHOLE TOWN BUZZING
FOR IT ONLY RAINS DURING A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS IN THE WINTER IN NEVADA
AND EVEN THEN NOT ENOUGH AT A TIME TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE FOR ANY
MERCHANT TO KEEP UMBRELLAS FOR SALE
BUT THE RAIN WAS NOT THE CHIEF
WONDER
IT ONLY LASTED FIVE OR TEN MINUTES WHILE THE PEOPLE WERE STILL
TALKING ABOUT IT ALL THE HEAVENS GATHERED TO THEMSELVES A DENSE BLACKNESS
AS OF MIDNIGHT
ALL THE VAST EASTERN FRONT OF MOUNT DAVIDSON
OVER LOOKING THE CITY PUT ON SUCH A FUNEREAL GLOOM THAT ONLY THE
NEARNESS AND SOLIDITY OF THE MOUNTAIN MADE ITS OUTLINES EVEN FAINTLY
DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE HEAVENS THEY RESTED
AGAINST
THIS UNACCUSTOMED SIGHT TURNED ALL EYES TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN
AND AS THEY LOOKED A LITTLE TONGUE OF RICH GOLDEN FLAME WAS SEEN WAVING
AND QUIVERING IN THE HEART OF THE MIDNIGHT AWAY UP ON THE EXTREME
SUMMIT IN A FEW MINUTES THE STREETS WERE PACKED WITH PEOPLE GAZING WITH
HARDLY AN UTTERED WORD AT THE ONE BRILLIANT MOTE IN THE BROODING WORLD
OF DARKNESS
IT FLICKED LIKE A CANDLE FLAME AND LOOKED NO LARGER BUT
WITH SUCH A BACKGROUND IT WAS WONDERFULLY BRIGHT SMALL AS IT WAS
IT
WAS THE FLAG THOUGH NO ONE SUSPECTED IT AT FIRST IT SEEMED SO LIKE A
SUPERNATURAL VISITOR OF SOME KIND A MYSTERIOUS MESSENGER OF GOOD
TIDINGS SOME WERE FAIN TO BELIEVE
IT WAS THE NATION'S EMBLEM
TRANSFIGURED BY THE DEPARTING RAYS OF A SUN THAT WAS ENTIRELY PALLED FROM
VIEW AND ON NO OTHER OBJECT DID THE GLORY FALL IN ALL THE BROAD
PANORAMA OF MOUNTAIN RANGES AND DESERTS
NOT EVEN UPON THE STAFF OF THE
FLAG FOR THAT A NEEDLE IN THE DISTANCE AT ANY TIME WAS NOW UNTOUCHED
BY THE LIGHT AND UNDISTINGUISHABLE IN THE GLOOM
FOR A WHOLE HOUR THE
WEIRD VISITOR WINKED AND BURNED IN ITS LOFTY SOLITUDE AND STILL THE
THOUSANDS OF UPLIFTED EYES WATCHED IT WITH FASCINATED INTEREST
HOW THE
PEOPLE WERE WROUGHT UP THE SUPERSTITION GREW APACE THAT THIS WAS A
MYSTIC COURIER COME WITH GREAT NEWS FROM THE WAR THE POETRY OF THE IDEA
EXCUSING AND COMMENDING IT AND ON IT SPREAD FROM HEART TO HEART FROM
LIP TO LIP AND FROM STREET TO STREET TILL THERE WAS A GENERAL IMPULSE TO
HAVE OUT THE MILITARY AND WELCOME THE BRIGHT WAIF WITH A SALVO OF
ARTILLERY
AND ALL THAT TIME ONE SORELY TRIED MAN THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR SWORN TO
OFFICIAL SECRECY HAD TO LOCK HIS LIPS AND CHAIN HIS TONGUE WITH A
SILENCE THAT WAS LIKE TO REND THEM FOR HE AND HE ONLY OF ALL THE
SPECULATING MULTITUDE KNEW THE GREAT THINGS THIS SINKING SUN HAD SEEN
THAT DAY IN THE EAST VICKSBURG FALLEN AND THE UNION ARMS VICTORIOUS AT
GETTYSBURG
BUT FOR THE JOURNALISTIC MONOPOLY THAT FORBADE THE SLIGHTEST REVEALMENT
OF EASTERN NEWS TILL A DAY AFTER ITS PUBLICATION IN THE CALIFORNIA
PAPERS THE GLORIFIED FLAG ON MOUNT DAVIDSON WOULD HAVE BEEN SALUTED AND
RE SALUTED THAT MEMORABLE EVENING AS LONG AS THERE WAS A CHARGE OF
POWDER TO THUNDER WITH THE CITY WOULD HAVE BEEN ILLUMINATED AND EVERY
MAN THAT HAD ANY RESPECT FOR HIMSELF WOULD HAVE GOT DRUNK AS WAS THE
CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY ON ALL OCCASIONS OF PUBLIC MOMENT
EVEN AT THIS
DISTANT DAY I CANNOT THINK OF THIS NEEDLESSLY MARRED SUPREME OPPORTUNITY
WITHOUT REGRET
WHAT A TIME WE MIGHT HAVE HAD
CHAPTER LVI
WE RUMBLED OVER THE PLAINS AND VALLEYS CLIMBED THE SIERRAS TO THE
CLOUDS AND LOOKED DOWN UPON SUMMER CLAD CALIFORNIA
AND I WILL REMARK
HERE IN PASSING THAT ALL SCENERY IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRES DISTANCE TO
GIVE IT ITS HIGHEST CHARM
THE MOUNTAINS ARE IMPOSING IN THEIR SUBLIMITY
AND THEIR MAJESTY OF FORM AND ALTITUDE FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW BUT ONE
MUST HAVE DISTANCE TO SOFTEN THEIR RUGGEDNESS AND ENRICH THEIR TINTINGS
A CALIFORNIAN FOREST IS BEST AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FOR THERE IS A SAD
POVERTY OF VARIETY IN SPECIES THE TREES BEING CHIEFLY OF ONE MONOTONOUS
FAMILY REDWOOD PINE SPRUCE FIR AND SO AT A NEAR VIEW THERE IS A
WEARISOME SAMENESS OF ATTITUDE IN THEIR RIGID ARMS STRETCHED DOWN WARD
AND OUTWARD IN ONE CONTINUED AND REITERATED APPEAL TO ALL MEN TO SH
DON'T SAY A WORD YOU MIGHT DISTURB SOMEBODY CLOSE AT HAND TOO
THERE IS A RELIEFLESS AND RELENTLESS SMELL OF PITCH AND TURPENTINE THERE
IS A CEASELESS MELANCHOLY IN THEIR SIGHING AND COMPLAINING FOLIAGE ONE
WALKS OVER A SOUNDLESS CARPET OF BEATEN YELLOW BARK AND DEAD SPINES OF
THE FOLIAGE TILL HE FEELS LIKE A WANDERING SPIRIT BEREFT OF A FOOTFALL
HE TIRES OF THE ENDLESS TUFTS OF NEEDLES AND YEARNS FOR SUBSTANTIAL
SHAPELY LEAVES HE LOOKS FOR MOSS AND GRASS TO LOLL UPON AND FINDS NONE
FOR WHERE THERE IS NO BARK THERE IS NAKED CLAY AND DIRT ENEMIES TO
PENSIVE MUSING AND CLEAN APPAREL
OFTEN A GRASSY PLAIN IN CALIFORNIA IS
WHAT IT SHOULD BE BUT OFTEN TOO IT IS BEST CONTEMPLATED AT A DISTANCE
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH ITS GRASS BLADES ARE TALL THEY STAND UP VINDICTIVELY
STRAIGHT AND SELF SUFFICIENT AND ARE UNSOCIABLY WIDE APART WITH
UNCOMELY SPOTS OF BARREN SAND BETWEEN
ONE OF THE QUEEREST THINGS I KNOW OF IS TO HEAR TOURISTS FROM THE
STATES GO INTO ECSTASIES OVER THE LOVELINESS OF EVER BLOOMING
CALIFORNIA AND THEY ALWAYS DO GO INTO THAT SORT OF ECSTASIES
BUT
PERHAPS THEY WOULD MODIFY THEM IF THEY KNEW HOW OLD CALIFORNIANS WITH
THE MEMORY FULL UPON THEM OF THE DUST COVERED AND QUESTIONABLE SUMMER
GREENS OF CALIFORNIAN VERDURE STAND ASTONISHED AND FILLED WITH
WORSHIPPING ADMIRATION IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LAVISH RICHNESS THE
BRILLIANT GREEN THE INFINITE FRESHNESS THE SPEND THRIFT VARIETY OF FORM
AND SPECIES AND FOLIAGE THAT MAKE AN EASTERN LANDSCAPE A VISION OF
PARADISE ITSELF
THE IDEA OF A MAN FALLING INTO RAPTURES OVER GRAVE AND
SOMBRE CALIFORNIA WHEN THAT MAN HAS SEEN NEW ENGLAND'S MEADOW EXPANSES
AND HER MAPLES OAKS AND CATHEDRAL WINDOWED ELMS DECKED IN SUMMER ATTIRE
OR THE OPALINE SPLENDORS OF AUTUMN DESCENDING UPON HER FORESTS COMES
VERY NEAR BEING FUNNY WOULD BE IN FACT BUT THAT IT IS SO PATHETIC
NO LAND WITH AN UNVARYING CLIMATE CAN BE VERY BEAUTIFUL
THE TROPICS ARE
NOT FOR ALL THE SENTIMENT THAT IS WASTED ON THEM
THEY SEEM BEAUTIFUL
AT FIRST BUT SAMENESS IMPAIRS THE CHARM BY AND BY
CHANGE IS THE
HANDMAIDEN NATURE REQUIRES TO DO HER MIRACLES WITH
THE LAND THAT HAS
FOUR WELL DEFINED SEASONS CANNOT LACK BEAUTY OR PALL WITH MONOTONY
EACH SEASON BRINGS A WORLD OF ENJOYMENT AND INTEREST IN THE WATCHING OF
ITS UNFOLDING ITS GRADUAL HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT ITS CULMINATING
GRACES AND JUST AS ONE BEGINS TO TIRE OF IT IT PASSES AWAY AND A
RADICAL CHANGE COMES WITH NEW WITCHERIES AND NEW GLORIES IN ITS TRAIN
AND I THINK THAT TO ONE IN SYMPATHY WITH NATURE EACH SEASON IN ITS
TURN SEEMS THE LOVELIEST
SAN FRANCISCO A TRULY FASCINATING CITY TO LIVE IN IS STATELY AND
HANDSOME AT A FAIR DISTANCE BUT CLOSE AT HAND ONE NOTES THAT THE
ARCHITECTURE IS MOSTLY OLD FASHIONED MANY STREETS ARE MADE UP OF
DECAYING SMOKE GRIMED WOODEN HOUSES AND THE BARREN SAND HILLS TOWARD
THE OUTSKIRTS OBTRUDE THEMSELVES TOO PROMINENTLY
EVEN THE KINDLY
CLIMATE IS SOMETIMES PLEASANTER WHEN READ ABOUT THAN PERSONALLY
EXPERIENCED FOR A LOVELY CLOUDLESS SKY WEARS OUT ITS WELCOME BY AND BY
AND THEN WHEN THE LONGED FOR RAIN DOES COME IT STAYS
EVEN THE PLAYFUL
EARTHQUAKE IS BETTER CONTEMPLATED AT A DIS
HOWEVER THERE ARE VARYING OPINIONS ABOUT THAT
THE CLIMATE OF SAN FRANCISCO IS MILD AND SINGULARLY EQUABLE
THE
THERMOMETER STANDS AT ABOUT SEVENTY DEGREES THE YEAR ROUND
IT HARDLY
CHANGES AT ALL
YOU SLEEP UNDER ONE OR TWO LIGHT BLANKETS SUMMER AND
WINTER AND NEVER USE A MOSQUITO BAR
NOBODY EVER WEARS SUMMER CLOTHING
YOU WEAR BLACK BROADCLOTH IF YOU HAVE IT IN AUGUST AND JANUARY JUST
THE SAME
IT IS NO COLDER AND NO WARMER IN THE ONE MONTH THAN THE
OTHER
YOU DO NOT USE OVERCOATS AND YOU DO NOT USE FANS
IT IS AS
PLEASANT A CLIMATE AS COULD WELL BE CONTRIVED TAKE IT ALL AROUND AND IS
DOUBTLESS THE MOST UNVARYING IN THE WHOLE WORLD
THE WIND BLOWS THERE A
GOOD DEAL IN THE SUMMER MONTHS BUT THEN YOU CAN GO OVER TO OAKLAND IF
YOU CHOOSE THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY IT DOES NOT BLOW THERE
IT HAS
ONLY SNOWED TWICE IN SAN FRANCISCO IN NINETEEN YEARS AND THEN IT ONLY
REMAINED ON THE GROUND LONG ENOUGH TO ASTONISH THE CHILDREN AND SET THEM
TO WONDERING WHAT THE FEATHERY STUFF WAS
DURING EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR STRAIGHT ALONG THE SKIES ARE BRIGHT AND
CLOUDLESS AND NEVER A DROP OF RAIN FALLS
BUT WHEN THE OTHER FOUR
MONTHS COME ALONG YOU WILL NEED TO GO AND STEAL AN UMBRELLA
BECAUSE
YOU WILL REQUIRE IT
NOT JUST ONE DAY BUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS
IN HARDLY VARYING SUCCESSION
WHEN YOU WANT TO GO VISITING OR ATTEND
CHURCH OR THE THEATRE YOU NEVER LOOK UP AT THE CLOUDS TO SEE WHETHER IT
IS LIKELY TO RAIN OR NOT YOU LOOK AT THE ALMANAC
IF IT IS WINTER IT
WILL RAIN AND IF IT IS SUMMER IT WON'T RAIN AND YOU CANNOT HELP IT
YOU NEVER NEED A LIGHTNING ROD BECAUSE IT NEVER THUNDERS AND IT NEVER
LIGHTENS
AND AFTER YOU HAVE LISTENED FOR SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS EVERY
NIGHT TO THE DISMAL MONOTONY OF THOSE QUIET RAINS YOU WILL WISH IN YOUR
HEART THE THUNDER WOULD LEAP AND CRASH AND ROAR ALONG THOSE DROWSY SKIES
ONCE AND MAKE EVERYTHING ALIVE YOU WILL WISH THE PRISONED LIGHTNINGS
WOULD CLEAVE THE DULL FIRMAMENT ASUNDER AND LIGHT IT WITH A BLINDING
GLARE FOR ONE LITTLE INSTANT
YOU WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO HEAR THE OLD
FAMILIAR THUNDER AGAIN AND SEE THE LIGHTNING STRIKE SOMEBODY
AND ALONG
IN THE SUMMER WHEN YOU HAVE SUFFERED ABOUT FOUR MONTHS OF LUSTROUS
PITILESS SUNSHINE YOU ARE READY TO GO DOWN ON YOUR KNEES AND PLEAD FOR
RAIN HAIL SNOW THUNDER AND LIGHTNING ANYTHING TO BREAK THE MONOTONY
YOU WILL TAKE AN EARTHQUAKE IF YOU CANNOT DO ANY BETTER
AND THE
CHANCES ARE THAT YOU'LL GET IT TOO
SAN FRANCISCO IS BUILT ON SAND HILLS BUT THEY ARE PROLIFIC SAND HILLS
THEY YIELD A GENEROUS VEGETATION
ALL THE RARE FLOWERS WHICH PEOPLE IN
THE STATES REAR WITH SUCH PATIENT CARE IN PARLOR FLOWER POTS AND
GREEN HOUSES FLOURISH LUXURIANTLY IN THE OPEN AIR THERE ALL THE YEAR
ROUND
CALLA LILIES ALL SORTS OF GERANIUMS PASSION FLOWERS MOSS
ROSES I DO NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF A TENTH PART OF THEM
I ONLY KNOW THAT
WHILE NEW YORKERS ARE BURDENED WITH BANKS AND DRIFTS OF SNOW
CALIFORNIANS ARE BURDENED WITH BANKS AND DRIFTS OF FLOWERS IF THEY ONLY
KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF AND LET THEM GROW
AND I HAVE HEARD THAT THEY HAVE
ALSO THAT RAREST AND MOST CURIOUS OF ALL THE FLOWERS THE BEAUTIFUL
ESPIRITU SANTO AS THE SPANIARDS CALL IT OR FLOWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
THOUGH I THOUGHT IT GREW ONLY IN CENTRAL AMERICA DOWN ON THE ISTHMUS
IN ITS CUP IS THE DAINTIEST LITTLE FACSIMILE OF A DOVE AS PURE AS SNOW
THE SPANIARDS HAVE A SUPERSTITIOUS REVERENCE FOR IT
THE BLOSSOM HAS
BEEN CONVEYED TO THE STATES SUBMERGED IN ETHER AND THE BULB HAS BEEN
TAKEN THITHER ALSO BUT EVERY ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT BLOOM AFTER IT ARRIVED
HAS FAILED
I HAVE ELSEWHERE SPOKEN OF THE ENDLESS WINTER OF MONO CALIFORNIA AND
BUT THIS MOMENT OF THE ETERNAL SPRING OF SAN FRANCISCO
NOW IF WE TRAVEL
A HUNDRED MILES IN A STRAIGHT LINE WE COME TO THE ETERNAL SUMMER OF
SACRAMENTO
ONE NEVER SEES SUMMER CLOTHING OR MOSQUITOES IN SAN
FRANCISCO BUT THEY CAN BE FOUND IN SACRAMENTO
NOT ALWAYS AND
UNVARYINGLY BUT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MONTHS OUT OF TWELVE
YEARS PERHAPS
FLOWERS BLOOM THERE ALWAYS THE READER CAN EASILY
BELIEVE PEOPLE SUFFER AND SWEAT AND SWEAR MORNING NOON AND NIGHT AND
WEAR OUT THEIR STANCHEST ENERGIES FANNING THEMSELVES
IT GETS HOT THERE
BUT IF YOU GO DOWN TO FORT YUMA YOU WILL FIND IT HOTTER
FORT YUMA IS
PROBABLY THE HOTTEST PLACE ON EARTH
THE THERMOMETER STAYS AT ONE
HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN THE SHADE THERE ALL THE TIME EXCEPT WHEN IT VARIES
AND GOES HIGHER
IT IS A U S
MILITARY POST AND ITS OCCUPANTS GET SO
USED TO THE TERRIFIC HEAT THAT THEY SUFFER WITHOUT IT
THERE IS A
TRADITION ATTRIBUTED TO JOHN PHENIX IT HAS BEEN PURLOINED BY FIFTY
DIFFERENT SCRIBBLERS WHO WERE TOO POOR TO INVENT A FANCY BUT NOT ASHAMED
TO STEAL ONE M
T THAT A VERY VERY WICKED SOLDIER DIED THERE
ONCE AND OF COURSE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOTTEST CORNER OF PERDITION
AND THE NEXT DAY HE TELEGRAPHED BACK FOR HIS BLANKETS
THERE IS NO DOUBT
ABOUT THE TRUTH OF THIS STATEMENT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
I
HAVE SEEN THE PLACE WHERE THAT SOLDIER USED TO BOARD
IN SACRAMENTO IT
IS FIERY SUMMER ALWAYS AND YOU CAN GATHER ROSES AND EAT STRAWBERRIES
AND ICE CREAM AND WEAR WHITE LINEN CLOTHES AND PANT AND PERSPIRE AT
EIGHT OR NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND THEN TAKE THE CARS AND AT NOON
PUT ON YOUR FURS AND YOUR SKATES AND GO SKIMMING OVER FROZEN DONNER
LAKE SEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY AMONG SNOW BANKS FIFTEEN FEET
DEEP AND IN THE SHADOW OF GRAND MOUNTAIN PEAKS THAT LIFT THEIR FROSTY
CRAGS TEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA
THERE IS A TRANSITION FOR YOU WHERE WILL YOU FIND ANOTHER LIKE IT IN
THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE AND SOME OF US HAVE SWEPT AROUND SNOW WALLED
CURVES OF THE PACIFIC RAILROAD IN THAT VICINITY SIX THOUSAND FEET ABOVE
THE SEA AND LOOKED DOWN AS THE BIRDS DO UPON THE DEATHLESS SUMMER OF
THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY WITH ITS FRUITFUL FIELDS ITS FEATHERY FOLIAGE
ITS SILVER STREAMS ALL SLUMBERING IN THE MELLOW HAZE OF ITS ENCHANTED
ATMOSPHERE AND ALL INFINITELY SOFTENED AND SPIRITUALIZED BY DISTANCE A
DREAMY EXQUISITE GLIMPSE OF FAIRYLAND MADE ALL THE MORE CHARMING AND
STRIKING THAT IT WAS CAUGHT THROUGH A FORBIDDEN GATEWAY OF ICE AND SNOW
AND SAVAGE CRAGS AND PRECIPICES
CHAPTER LVII
IT WAS IN THIS SACRAMENTO VALLEY JUST REFERRED TO THAT A DEAL OF THE
MOST LUCRATIVE OF THE EARLY GOLD MINING WAS DONE AND YOU MAY STILL SEE
IN PLACES ITS GRASSY SLOPES AND LEVELS TORN AND GUTTERED AND DISFIGURED
BY THE AVARICIOUS SPOILERS OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS AGO
YOU MAY SEE
SUCH DISFIGUREMENTS FAR AND WIDE OVER CALIFORNIA AND IN SOME SUCH
PLACES WHERE ONLY MEADOWS AND FORESTS ARE VISIBLE NOT A LIVING
CREATURE NOT A HOUSE NO STICK OR STONE OR REMNANT OF A RUIN AND NOT A
SOUND NOT EVEN A WHISPER TO DISTURB THE SABBATH STILLNESS YOU WILL FIND
IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE STOOD AT ONE TIME A FIERCELY FLOURISHING
LITTLE CITY OF TWO THOUSAND OR THREE THOUSAND SOULS WITH ITS NEWSPAPER
FIRE COMPANY BRASS BAND VOLUNTEER MILITIA BANK HOTELS NOISY FOURTH
OF JULY PROCESSIONS AND SPEECHES GAMBLING HELLS CRAMMED WITH TOBACCO
SMOKE PROFANITY AND ROUGH BEARDED MEN OF ALL NATIONS AND COLORS WITH
TABLES HEAPED WITH GOLD DUST SUFFICIENT FOR THE REVENUES OF A GERMAN
PRINCIPALITY STREETS CROWDED AND RIFE WITH BUSINESS TOWN LOTS WORTH
FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A FRONT FOOT LABOR LAUGHTER MUSIC DANCING
SWEARING FIGHTING SHOOTING STABBING A BLOODY INQUEST AND A MAN FOR
BREAKFAST EVERY MORNING EVERYTHING THAT DELIGHTS AND ADORNS EXISTENCE
ALL THE APPOINTMENTS AND APPURTENANCES OF A THRIVING AND PROSPEROUS AND
PROMISING YOUNG CITY AND NOW NOTHING IS LEFT OF IT ALL BUT A LIFELESS
HOMELESS SOLITUDE
THE MEN ARE GONE THE HOUSES HAVE VANISHED EVEN THE
NAME OF THE PLACE IS FORGOTTEN
IN NO OTHER LAND IN MODERN TIMES HAVE
TOWNS SO ABSOLUTELY DIED AND DISAPPEARED AS IN THE OLD MINING REGIONS OF
CALIFORNIA
IT WAS A DRIVING VIGOROUS RESTLESS POPULATION IN THOSE DAYS
IT WAS A
CURIOUS POPULATION
IT WAS THE ONLY POPULATION OF THE KIND THAT THE
WORLD HAS EVER SEEN GATHERED TOGETHER AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THE
WORLD WILL EVER SEE ITS LIKE AGAIN
FOR OBSERVE IT WAS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND YOUNG MEN NOT SIMPERING DAINTY KID GLOVED
WEAKLINGS BUT STALWART MUSCULAR DAUNTLESS YOUNG BRAVES BRIMFUL OF
PUSH AND ENERGY AND ROYALLY ENDOWED WITH EVERY ATTRIBUTE THAT GOES TO
MAKE UP A PEERLESS AND MAGNIFICENT MANHOOD THE VERY PICK AND CHOICE OF
THE WORLD'S GLORIOUS ONES
NO WOMEN NO CHILDREN NO GRAY AND STOOPING
VETERANS NONE BUT ERECT BRIGHT EYED QUICK MOVING STRONG HANDED YOUNG
GIANTS THE STRANGEST POPULATION THE FINEST POPULATION THE MOST GALLANT
HOST THAT EVER TROOPED DOWN THE STARTLED SOLITUDES OF AN UNPEOPLED LAND
AND WHERE ARE THEY NOW SCATTERED TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH OR
PREMATURELY AGED AND DECREPIT OR SHOT OR STABBED IN STREET AFFRAYS OR
DEAD OF DISAPPOINTED HOPES AND BROKEN HEARTS ALL GONE OR NEARLY ALL
VICTIMS DEVOTED UPON THE ALTAR OF THE GOLDEN CALF THE NOBLEST HOLOCAUST
THAT EVER WAFTED ITS SACRIFICIAL INCENSE HEAVENWARD
IT IS PITIFUL TO
THINK UPON
IT WAS A SPLENDID POPULATION FOR ALL THE SLOW SLEEPY SLUGGISH BRAINED
SLOTHS STAID AT HOME YOU NEVER FIND THAT SORT OF PEOPLE AMONG PIONEERS
YOU CANNOT BUILD PIONEERS OUT OF THAT SORT OF MATERIAL
IT WAS THAT
POPULATION THAT GAVE TO CALIFORNIA A NAME FOR GETTING UP ASTOUNDING
ENTERPRISES AND RUSHING THEM THROUGH WITH A MAGNIFICENT DASH AND DARING
AND A RECKLESSNESS OF COST OR CONSEQUENCES WHICH SHE BEARS UNTO THIS
DAY AND WHEN SHE PROJECTS A NEW SURPRISE THE GRAVE WORLD SMILES AS
USUAL AND SAYS WELL THAT IS CALIFORNIA ALL OVER
BUT THEY WERE ROUGH IN THOSE TIMES THEY FAIRLY REVELED IN GOLD WHISKY
FIGHTS AND FANDANGOES AND WERE UNSPEAKABLY HAPPY
THE HONEST MINER
RAKED FROM A HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF HIS CLAIM A DAY AND
WHAT WITH THE GAMBLING DENS AND THE OTHER ENTERTAINMENTS HE HADN'T A
CENT THE NEXT MORNING IF HE HAD ANY SORT OF LUCK
THEY COOKED THEIR OWN
BACON AND BEANS SEWED ON THEIR OWN BUTTONS WASHED THEIR OWN SHIRTS
BLUE WOOLLEN ONES AND IF A MAN WANTED A FIGHT ON HIS HANDS WITHOUT ANY
ANNOYING DELAY ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS TO APPEAR IN PUBLIC IN A WHITE SHIRT
OR A STOVE PIPE HAT AND HE WOULD BE ACCOMMODATED
FOR THOSE PEOPLE
HATED ARISTOCRATS
THEY HAD A PARTICULAR AND MALIGNANT ANIMOSITY TOWARD
WHAT THEY CALLED A BILED SHIRT
IT WAS A WILD FREE DISORDERLY GROTESQUE SOCIETY MEN ONLY SWARMING
HOSTS OF STALWART MEN NOTHING JUVENILE NOTHING FEMININE VISIBLE
ANYWHERE
IN THOSE DAYS MINERS WOULD FLOCK IN CROWDS TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THAT
RARE AND BLESSED SPECTACLE A WOMAN OLD INHABITANTS TELL HOW IN A
CERTAIN CAMP THE NEWS WENT ABROAD EARLY IN THE MORNING THAT A WOMAN WAS
COME THEY HAD SEEN A CALICO DRESS HANGING OUT OF A WAGON DOWN AT THE
CAMPING GROUND SIGN OF EMIGRANTS FROM OVER THE GREAT PLAINS
EVERYBODY
WENT DOWN THERE AND A SHOUT WENT UP WHEN AN ACTUAL BONA FIDE DRESS WAS
DISCOVERED FLUTTERING IN THE WIND THE MALE EMIGRANT WAS VISIBLE
THE
MINERS SAID
FETCH HER OUT
HE SAID IT IS MY WIFE GENTLEMEN SHE IS SICK WE HAVE BEEN ROBBED OF
MONEY PROVISIONS EVERYTHING BY THE INDIANS WE WANT TO REST
FETCH HER OUT WE'VE GOT TO SEE HER
BUT GENTLEMEN THE POOR THING SHE
FETCH HER OUT
HE FETCHED HER OUT AND THEY SWUNG THEIR HATS AND SENT UP THREE ROUSING
CHEERS AND A TIGER AND THEY CROWDED AROUND AND GAZED AT HER AND TOUCHED
HER DRESS AND LISTENED TO HER VOICE WITH THE LOOK OF MEN WHO LISTENED TO
A MEMORY RATHER THAN A PRESENT REALITY AND THEN THEY COLLECTED
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN GOLD AND GAVE IT TO THE MAN AND SWUNG
THEIR HATS AGAIN AND GAVE THREE MORE CHEERS AND WENT HOME SATISFIED
ONCE I DINED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE FAMILY OF A PIONEER AND TALKED
WITH HIS DAUGHTER A YOUNG LADY WHOSE FIRST EXPERIENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO
WAS AN ADVENTURE THOUGH SHE HERSELF DID NOT REMEMBER IT AS SHE WAS ONLY
TWO OR THREE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME
HER FATHER SAID THAT AFTER LANDING
FROM THE SHIP THEY WERE WALKING UP THE STREET A SERVANT LEADING THE
PARTY WITH THE LITTLE GIRL IN HER ARMS
AND PRESENTLY A HUGE MINER
BEARDED BELTED SPURRED AND BRISTLING WITH DEADLY WEAPONS JUST DOWN
FROM A LONG CAMPAIGN IN THE MOUNTAINS EVIDENTLY BARRED THE WAY STOPPED
THE SERVANT AND STOOD GAZING WITH A FACE ALL ALIVE WITH GRATIFICATION
AND ASTONISHMENT
THEN HE SAID REVERENTLY
WELL IF IT AIN'T A CHILD AND THEN HE SNATCHED A LITTLE LEATHER SACK
OUT OF HIS POCKET AND SAID TO THE SERVANT
THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IN DUST THERE AND I'LL GIVE IT TO
YOU TO LET ME KISS THE CHILD
THAT ANECDOTE IS TRUE
BUT SEE HOW THINGS CHANGE
SITTING AT THAT DINNER TABLE LISTENING TO
THAT ANECDOTE IF I HAD OFFERED DOUBLE THE MONEY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF
KISSING THE SAME CHILD I WOULD HAVE BEEN REFUSED
SEVENTEEN ADDED YEARS
HAVE FAR MORE THAN DOUBLED THE PRICE
AND WHILE UPON THIS SUBJECT I WILL REMARK THAT ONCE IN STAR CITY IN THE
HUMBOLDT MOUNTAINS I TOOK MY PLACE IN A SORT OF LONG POST OFFICE SINGLE
FILE OF MINERS TO PATIENTLY AWAIT MY CHANCE TO PEEP THROUGH A CRACK IN
THE CABIN AND GET A SIGHT OF THE SPLENDID NEW SENSATION A GENUINE LIVE
WOMAN AND AT THE END OF HALF OF AN HOUR MY TURN CAME AND I PUT MY EYE
TO THE CRACK AND THERE SHE WAS WITH ONE ARM AKIMBO AND TOSSING
FLAP JACKS IN A FRYING PAN WITH THE OTHER
AND SHE WAS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE BEING IN CALMER MOOD NOW I
VOLUNTARILY KNOCK OFF A HUNDRED FROM THAT M T YEARS OLD AND HADN'T A
TOOTH IN HER HEAD
CHAPTER LVIII
FOR A FEW MONTHS I ENJOYED WHAT TO ME WAS AN ENTIRELY NEW PHASE OF
EXISTENCE A BUTTERFLY IDLENESS NOTHING TO DO NOBODY TO BE RESPONSIBLE
TO AND UNTROUBLED WITH FINANCIAL UNEASINESS
I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE
MOST CORDIAL AND SOCIABLE CITY IN THE UNION
AFTER THE SAGE BRUSH AND
ALKALI DESERTS OF WASHOE SAN FRANCISCO WAS PARADISE TO ME
I LIVED AT
THE BEST HOTEL EXHIBITED MY CLOTHES IN THE MOST CONSPICUOUS PLACES
INFESTED THE OPERA AND LEARNED TO SEEM ENRAPTURED WITH MUSIC WHICH
OFTENER AFFLICTED MY IGNORANT EAR THAN ENCHANTED IT IF I HAD HAD THE
VULGAR HONESTY TO CONFESS IT
HOWEVER I SUPPOSE I WAS NOT GREATLY WORSE
THAN THE MOST OF MY COUNTRYMEN IN THAT
I HAD LONGED TO BE A BUTTERFLY
AND I WAS ONE AT LAST
I ATTENDED PRIVATE PARTIES IN SUMPTUOUS EVENING
DRESS SIMPERED AND AIRED MY GRACES LIKE A BORN BEAU AND POLKAD AND
SCHOTTISCHED WITH A STEP PECULIAR TO MYSELF AND THE KANGAROO
IN A
WORD I KEPT THE DUE STATE OF A MAN WORTH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
PROSPECTIVELY AND LIKELY TO REACH ABSOLUTE AFFLUENCE WHEN THAT
SILVER MINE SALE SHOULD BE ULTIMATELY ACHIEVED IN THE EAST
I SPENT
MONEY WITH A FREE HAND AND MEANTIME WATCHED THE STOCK SALES WITH AN
INTERESTED EYE AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN NEVADA
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAPPENED
THE PROPERTY HOLDERS OF NEVADA VOTED
AGAINST THE STATE CONSTITUTION BUT THE FOLKS WHO HAD NOTHING TO LOSE
WERE IN THE MAJORITY AND CARRIED THE MEASURE OVER THEIR HEADS
BUT
AFTER ALL IT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY LOOK LIKE A DISASTER THOUGH
UNQUESTIONABLY IT WAS ONE I HESITATED CALCULATED THE CHANCES AND THEN
CONCLUDED NOT TO SELL
STOCKS WENT ON RISING SPECULATION WENT MAD
BANKERS MERCHANTS LAWYERS DOCTORS MECHANICS LABORERS EVEN THE VERY
WASHERWOMEN AND SERVANT GIRLS WERE PUTTING UP THEIR EARNINGS ON SILVER
STOCKS AND EVERY SUN THAT ROSE IN THE MORNING WENT DOWN ON PAUPERS
ENRICHED AND RICH MEN BEGGARED
WHAT A GAMBLING CARNIVAL IT WAS GOULD
AND CURRY SOARED TO SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT AND THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN OUT WENT THE BOTTOM AND EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY WENT
TO RUIN AND DESTRUCTION THE WRECK WAS COMPLETE
THE BUBBLE SCARCELY LEFT A MICROSCOPIC MOISTURE BEHIND IT
I WAS AN
EARLY BEGGAR AND A THOROUGH ONE
MY HOARDED STOCKS WERE NOT WORTH THE
PAPER THEY WERE PRINTED ON
I THREW THEM ALL AWAY
I THE CHEERFUL
IDIOT THAT HAD BEEN SQUANDERING MONEY LIKE WATER AND THOUGHT MYSELF
BEYOND THE REACH OF MISFORTUNE HAD NOT NOW AS MUCH AS FIFTY DOLLARS WHEN
I GATHERED TOGETHER MY VARIOUS DEBTS AND PAID THEM
I REMOVED FROM THE
HOTEL TO A VERY PRIVATE BOARDING HOUSE
I TOOK A REPORTER'S BERTH AND
WENT TO WORK
I WAS NOT ENTIRELY BROKEN IN SPIRIT FOR I WAS BUILDING
CONFIDENTLY ON THE SALE OF THE SILVER MINE IN THE EAST
BUT I COULD NOT
HEAR FROM DAN
MY LETTERS MISCARRIED OR WERE NOT ANSWERED
ONE DAY I DID NOT FEEL VIGOROUS AND REMAINED AWAY FROM THE OFFICE
THE
NEXT DAY I WENT DOWN TOWARD NOON AS USUAL AND FOUND A NOTE ON MY DESK
WHICH HAD BEEN THERE TWENTY FOUR HOURS
IT WAS SIGNED MARSHALL THE
VIRGINIA REPORTER AND CONTAINED A REQUEST THAT I SHOULD CALL AT THE
HOTEL AND SEE HIM AND A FRIEND OR TWO THAT NIGHT AS THEY WOULD SAIL FOR
THE EAST IN THE MORNING
A POSTSCRIPT ADDED THAT THEIR ERRAND WAS A BIG
MINING SPECULATION I WAS HARDLY EVER SO SICK IN MY LIFE
I ABUSED
MYSELF FOR LEAVING VIRGINIA AND ENTRUSTING TO ANOTHER MAN A MATTER I
OUGHT TO HAVE ATTENDED TO MYSELF I ABUSED MYSELF FOR REMAINING AWAY FROM
THE OFFICE ON THE ONE DAY OF ALL THE YEAR THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
AND THUS BERATING MYSELF I TROTTED A MILE TO THE STEAMER WHARF AND
ARRIVED JUST IN TIME TO BE TOO LATE
THE SHIP WAS IN THE STREAM AND
UNDER WAY
I COMFORTED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT MAY BE THE SPECULATION WOULD
AMOUNT TO NOTHING POOR COMFORT AT BEST AND THEN WENT BACK TO MY
SLAVERY RESOLVED TO PUT UP WITH MY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK AND FORGET
ALL ABOUT IT
A MONTH AFTERWARD I ENJOYED MY FIRST EARTHQUAKE
IT WAS ONE WHICH WAS
LONG CALLED THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AND IS DOUBTLESS SO DISTINGUISHED
TILL THIS DAY
IT WAS JUST AFTER NOON ON A BRIGHT OCTOBER DAY
I WAS
COMING DOWN THIRD STREET
THE ONLY OBJECTS IN MOTION ANYWHERE IN SIGHT
IN THAT THICKLY BUILT AND POPULOUS QUARTER WERE A MAN IN A BUGGY BEHIND
ME AND A STREET CAR WENDING SLOWLY UP THE CROSS STREET
OTHERWISE ALL
WAS SOLITUDE AND A SABBATH STILLNESS
AS I TURNED THE CORNER AROUND A
FRAME HOUSE THERE WAS A GREAT RATTLE AND JAR AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT
HERE WAS AN ITEM NO DOUBT A FIGHT IN THAT HOUSE
BEFORE I COULD TURN
AND SEEK THE DOOR THERE CAME A REALLY TERRIFIC SHOCK THE GROUND SEEMED
TO ROLL UNDER ME IN WAVES INTERRUPTED BY A VIOLENT JOGGLING UP AND DOWN
AND THERE WAS A HEAVY GRINDING NOISE AS OF BRICK HOUSES RUBBING TOGETHER
I FELL UP AGAINST THE FRAME HOUSE AND HURT MY ELBOW
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS
NOW AND FROM MERE REPORTORIAL INSTINCT NOTHING ELSE TOOK OUT MY WATCH
AND NOTED THE TIME OF DAY AT THAT MOMENT A THIRD AND STILL SEVERER SHOCK
CAME AND AS I REELED ABOUT ON THE PAVEMENT TRYING TO KEEP MY FOOTING
I SAW A SIGHT THE ENTIRE FRONT OF A TALL FOUR STORY BRICK BUILDING IN
THIRD STREET SPRUNG OUTWARD LIKE A DOOR AND FELL SPRAWLING ACROSS THE
STREET RAISING A DUST LIKE A GREAT VOLUME OF SMOKE AND HERE CAME THE
BUGGY OVERBOARD WENT THE MAN AND IN LESS TIME THAN I CAN TELL IT THE
VEHICLE WAS DISTRIBUTED IN SMALL FRAGMENTS ALONG THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF
STREET
ONE COULD HAVE FANCIED THAT SOMEBODY HAD FIRED A CHARGE OF CHAIR ROUNDS
AND RAGS DOWN THE THOROUGHFARE
THE STREET CAR HAD STOPPED THE HORSES
WERE REARING AND PLUNGING THE PASSENGERS WERE POURING OUT AT BOTH ENDS
AND ONE FAT MAN HAD CRASHED HALF WAY THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW ON ONE SIDE
OF THE CAR GOT WEDGED FAST AND WAS SQUIRMING AND SCREAMING LIKE AN
IMPALED MADMAN
EVERY DOOR OF EVERY HOUSE AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD
REACH WAS VOMITING A STREAM OF HUMAN BEINGS AND ALMOST BEFORE ONE COULD
EXECUTE A WINK AND BEGIN ANOTHER THERE WAS A MASSED MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE
STRETCHING IN ENDLESS PROCESSION DOWN EVERY STREET MY POSITION COMMANDED
NEVER WAS SOLEMN SOLITUDE TURNED INTO TEEMING LIFE QUICKER
OF THE WONDERS WROUGHT BY THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE THESE WERE ALL THAT
CAME UNDER MY EYE BUT THE TRICKS IT DID ELSEWHERE AND FAR AND WIDE
OVER THE TOWN MADE TOOTHSOME GOSSIP FOR NINE DAYS
THE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY WAS TRIFLING THE INJURY TO IT WAS
WIDE SPREAD AND SOMEWHAT SERIOUS
THE CURIOSITIES OF THE EARTHQUAKE WERE SIMPLY ENDLESS
GENTLEMEN AND
LADIES WHO WERE SICK OR WERE TAKING A SIESTA OR HAD DISSIPATED TILL A
LATE HOUR AND WERE MAKING UP LOST SLEEP THRONGED INTO THE PUBLIC STREETS
IN ALL SORTS OF QUEER APPAREL AND SOME WITHOUT ANY AT ALL
ONE WOMAN
WHO HAD BEEN WASHING A NAKED CHILD RAN DOWN THE STREET HOLDING IT BY THE
ANKLES AS IF IT WERE A DRESSED TURKEY
PROMINENT CITIZENS WHO WERE
SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE SABBATH STRICTLY RUSHED OUT OF SALOONS IN THEIR
SHIRT SLEEVES WITH BILLIARD CUES IN THEIR HANDS
DOZENS OF MEN WITH
NECKS SWATHED IN NAPKINS RUSHED FROM BARBER SHOPS LATHERED TO THE EYES
OR WITH ONE CHEEK CLEAN SHAVED AND THE OTHER STILL BEARING A HAIRY
STUBBLE
HORSES BROKE FROM STABLES AND A FRIGHTENED DOG RUSHED UP A
SHORT ATTIC LADDER AND OUT ON TO A ROOF AND WHEN HIS SCARE WAS OVER HAD
NOT THE NERVE TO GO DOWN AGAIN THE SAME WAY HE HAD GONE UP
A PROMINENT EDITOR FLEW DOWN STAIRS IN THE PRINCIPAL HOTEL WITH NOTHING
ON BUT ONE BRIEF UNDERGARMENT MET A CHAMBERMAID AND EXCLAIMED
OH WHAT SHALL I DO WHERE SHALL I GO
SHE RESPONDED WITH NAIVE SERENITY
IF YOU HAVE NO CHOICE YOU MIGHT TRY A CLOTHING STORE
A CERTAIN FOREIGN CONSUL'S LADY WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER OF FASHION
AND EVERY TIME SHE APPEARED IN ANYTHING NEW OR EXTRAORDINARY THE LADIES
IN THE VICINITY MADE A RAID ON THEIR HUSBANDS' PURSES AND ARRAYED
THEMSELVES SIMILARLY
ONE MAN WHO HAD SUFFERED CONSIDERABLY AND GROWLED
ACCORDINGLY WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW WHEN THE SHOCKS CAME AND THE
NEXT INSTANT THE CONSUL'S WIFE JUST OUT OF THE BATH FLED BY WITH NO
OTHER APOLOGY FOR CLOTHING THAN A BATH TOWEL THE SUFFERER ROSE
SUPERIOR TO THE TERRORS OF THE EARTHQUAKE AND SAID TO HIS WIFE
NOW THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE GET OUT YOUR TOWEL MY DEAR
THE PLASTERING THAT FELL FROM CEILINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT DAY WOULD
HAVE COVERED SEVERAL ACRES OF GROUND
FOR SOME DAYS AFTERWARD GROUPS OF
EYEING AND POINTING MEN STOOD ABOUT MANY A BUILDING LOOKING AT LONG
ZIG ZAG CRACKS THAT EXTENDED FROM THE EAVES TO THE GROUND
FOUR FEET OF
THE TOPS OF THREE CHIMNEYS ON ONE HOUSE WERE BROKEN SQUARE OFF AND TURNED
AROUND IN SUCH A WAY AS TO COMPLETELY STOP THE DRAFT
A CRACK A HUNDRED FEET LONG GAPED OPEN SIX INCHES WIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF
ONE STREET AND THEN SHUT TOGETHER AGAIN WITH SUCH FORCE AS TO RIDGE UP
THE MEETING EARTH LIKE A SLENDER GRAVE
A LADY SITTING IN HER ROCKING
AND QUAKING PARLOR SAW THE WALL PART AT THE CEILING OPEN AND SHUT
TWICE LIKE A MOUTH AND THEN DROP THE END OF A BRICK ON THE FLOOR LIKE A
TOOTH
SHE WAS A WOMAN EASILY DISGUSTED WITH FOOLISHNESS AND SHE AROSE
AND WENT OUT OF THERE
ONE LADY WHO WAS COMING DOWN STAIRS WAS
ASTONISHED TO SEE A BRONZE HERCULES LEAN FORWARD ON ITS PEDESTAL AS IF TO
STRIKE HER WITH ITS CLUB
THEY BOTH REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE FLIGHT AT
THE SAME TIME THE WOMAN INSENSIBLE FROM THE FRIGHT
HER CHILD BORN
SOME LITTLE TIME AFTERWARD WAS CLUB FOOTED
HOWEVER ON SECOND
THOUGHT IF THE READER SEES ANY COINCIDENCE IN THIS HE MUST DO IT AT
HIS OWN RISK
THE FIRST SHOCK BROUGHT DOWN TWO OR THREE HUGE ORGAN PIPES IN ONE OF THE
CHURCHES
THE MINISTER WITH UPLIFTED HANDS WAS JUST CLOSING THE
SERVICES
HE GLANCED UP HESITATED AND SAID
HOWEVER WE WILL OMIT THE BENEDICTION AND THE NEXT INSTANT THERE WAS
A VACANCY IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE HE HAD STOOD
AFTER THE FIRST SHOCK AN OAKLAND MINISTER SAID
KEEP YOUR SEATS THERE IS NO BETTER PLACE TO DIE THAN THIS
AND ADDED AFTER THE THIRD
BUT OUTSIDE IS GOOD ENOUGH HE THEN SKIPPED OUT AT THE BACK DOOR
SUCH ANOTHER DESTRUCTION OF MANTEL ORNAMENTS AND TOILET BOTTLES AS THE
EARTHQUAKE CREATED SAN FRANCISCO NEVER SAW BEFORE
THERE WAS HARDLY A
GIRL OR A MATRON IN THE CITY BUT SUFFERED LOSSES OF THIS KIND
SUSPENDED
PICTURES WERE THROWN DOWN BUT OFTENER STILL BY A CURIOUS FREAK OF THE
EARTHQUAKE'S HUMOR THEY WERE WHIRLED COMPLETELY AROUND WITH THEIR FACES
TO THE WALL THERE WAS GREAT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AT FIRST AS TO THE
COURSE OR DIRECTION THE EARTHQUAKE TRAVELED BUT WATER THAT SPLASHED OUT
OF VARIOUS TANKS AND BUCKETS SETTLED THAT
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE MADE
SO SEA SICK BY THE ROLLING AND PITCHING OF FLOORS AND STREETS THAT THEY
WERE WEAK AND BED RIDDEN FOR HOURS AND SOME FEW FOR EVEN DAYS
AFTERWARD HARDLY AN INDIVIDUAL ESCAPED NAUSEA ENTIRELY
THE QUEER EARTHQUAKE EPISODES THAT FORMED THE STAPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO
GOSSIP FOR THE NEXT WEEK WOULD FILL A MUCH LARGER BOOK THAN THIS AND SO
I WILL DIVERGE FROM THE SUBJECT
BY AND BY IN THE DUE COURSE OF THINGS I PICKED UP A COPY OF THE
ENTERPRISE ONE DAY AND FELL UNDER THIS CRUEL BLOW
NEVADA MINES IN NEW YORK G
M
MARSHALL SHEBA HURS AND AMOS H
ROSE WHO LEFT SAN FRANCISCO LAST JULY FOR NEW YORK CITY WITH ORES
FROM MINES IN PINE WOOD DISTRICT HUMBOLDT COUNTY AND ON THE REESE
RIVER RANGE HAVE DISPOSED OF A MINE CONTAINING SIX THOUSAND FEET
AND CALLED THE PINE MOUNTAINS CONSOLIDATED FOR THE SUM OF
3 000 000
THE STAMPS ON THE DEED WHICH IS NOW ON ITS WAY TO
HUMBOLDT COUNTY FROM NEW YORK FOR RECORD AMOUNTED TO 3 000
WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF STAMPS EVER PLACED ON ONE
DOCUMENT
A WORKING CAPITAL OF 1 000 000 HAS BEEN PAID INTO THE
TREASURY AND MACHINERY HAS ALREADY BEEN PURCHASED FOR A LARGE
QUARTZ MILL WHICH WILL BE PUT UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
THE STOCK IN
THIS COMPANY IS ALL FULL PAID AND ENTIRELY UNASSESSABLE
THE ORES
OF THE MINES IN THIS DISTRICT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLE THOSE OF THE SHEBA
MINE IN HUMBOLDT
SHEBA HURST THE DISCOVERER OF THE MINES WITH
HIS FRIENDS CORRALLED ALL THE BEST LEADS AND ALL THE LAND AND TIMBER
THEY DESIRED BEFORE MAKING PUBLIC THEIR WHEREABOUTS
ORES FROM
THERE ASSAYED IN THIS CITY SHOWED THEM TO BE EXCEEDINGLY RICH IN
SILVER AND GOLD SILVER PREDOMINATING
THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF
WOOD AND WATER IN THE DISTRICT
WE ARE GLAD TO KNOW THAT NEW YORK
CAPITAL HAS BEEN ENLISTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINES OF THIS
REGION
HAVING SEEN THE ORES AND ASSAYS WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THE
MINES OF THE DISTRICT ARE VERY VALUABLE ANYTHING BUT WILD CAT
ONCE MORE NATIVE IMBECILITY HAD CARRIED THE DAY AND I HAD LOST A
MILLION IT WAS THE BLIND LEAD OVER AGAIN
LET US NOT DWELL ON THIS MISERABLE MATTER
IF I WERE INVENTING THESE
THINGS I COULD BE WONDERFULLY HUMOROUS OVER THEM BUT THEY ARE TOO TRUE
TO BE TALKED OF WITH HEARTY LEVITY EVEN AT THIS DISTANT DAY
TRUE AND
YET NOT EXACTLY AS GIVEN IN THE ABOVE FIGURES POSSIBLY
I SAW MARSHALL
MONTHS AFTERWARD AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY HE DID NOT CLAIM TO
HAVE CAPTURED AN ENTIRE MILLION
IN FACT I GATHERED THAT HE HAD NOT THEN
RECEIVED 50 000
BEYOND THAT FIGURE HIS FORTUNE APPEARED TO CONSIST OF
UNCERTAIN VAST EXPECTATIONS RATHER THAN PRODIGIOUS CERTAINTIES
HOWEVER
WHEN THE ABOVE ITEM APPEARED IN PRINT I PUT FULL FAITH IN IT AND
INCONTINENTLY WILTED AND WENT TO SEED UNDER IT SUFFICE IT THAT I SO
LOST HEART AND SO YIELDED MYSELF UP TO REPININGS AND SIGHINGS AND
FOOLISH REGRETS THAT I NEGLECTED MY DUTIES AND BECAME ABOUT WORTHLESS
AS A REPORTER FOR A BRISK NEWSPAPER
AND AT LAST ONE OF THE PROPRIETORS
TOOK ME ASIDE WITH A CHARITY I STILL REMEMBER WITH CONSIDERABLE RESPECT
AND GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESIGN MY BERTH AND SO SAVE MYSELF THE
DISGRACE OF A DISMISSAL
CHAPTER LIX
FOR A TIME I WROTE LITERARY SCREEDS FOR THE GOLDEN ERA
C
H
WEBB HAD
ESTABLISHED A VERY EXCELLENT LITERARY WEEKLY CALLED THE CALIFORNIAN BUT
HIGH MERIT WAS NO GUARANTY OF SUCCESS IT LANGUISHED AND HE SOLD OUT TO
THREE PRINTERS AND BRET HARTE BECAME EDITOR AT 20 A WEEK AND I WAS
EMPLOYED TO CONTRIBUTE AN ARTICLE A WEEK AT 12
BUT THE JOURNAL STILL
LANGUISHED AND THE PRINTERS SOLD OUT TO CAPTAIN OGDEN A RICH MAN AND A
PLEASANT GENTLEMAN WHO CHOSE TO AMUSE HIMSELF WITH SUCH AN EXPENSIVE
LUXURY WITHOUT MUCH CARING ABOUT THE COST OF IT
WHEN HE GREW TIRED OF
THE NOVELTY HE RE SOLD TO THE PRINTERS THE PAPER PRESENTLY DIED A
PEACEFUL DEATH AND I WAS OUT OF WORK AGAIN
I WOULD NOT MENTION THESE
THINGS BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY SO APTLY ILLUSTRATE THE UPS AND DOWNS
THAT CHARACTERIZE LIFE ON THE PACIFIC COAST
A MAN COULD HARDLY STUMBLE
INTO SUCH A VARIETY OF QUEER VICISSITUDES IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY
FOR TWO MONTHS MY SOLE OCCUPATION WAS AVOIDING ACQUAINTANCES FOR DURING
THAT TIME I DID NOT EARN A PENNY OR BUY AN ARTICLE OF ANY KIND OR PAY
MY BOARD
I BECAME A VERY ADEPT AT SLINKING I SLUNK FROM BACK STREET
TO BACK STREET I SLUNK AWAY FROM APPROACHING FACES THAT LOOKED FAMILIAR
I SLUNK TO MY MEALS ATE THEM HUMBLY AND WITH A MUTE APOLOGY FOR EVERY
MOUTHFUL I ROBBED MY GENEROUS LANDLADY OF AND AT MIDNIGHT AFTER
WANDERINGS THAT WERE BUT SLINKINGS AWAY FROM CHEERFULNESS AND LIGHT I
SLUNK TO MY BED
I FELT MEANER AND LOWLIER AND MORE DESPICABLE THAN THE
WORMS
DURING ALL THIS TIME I HAD BUT ONE PIECE OF MONEY A SILVER TEN
CENT PIECE AND I HELD TO IT AND WOULD NOT SPEND IT ON ANY ACCOUNT LEST
THE CONSCIOUSNESS COMING STRONG UPON ME THAT I WAS ENTIRELY PENNILESS
MIGHT SUGGEST SUICIDE
I HAD PAWNED EVERY THING BUT THE CLOTHES I HAD
ON SO I CLUNG TO MY DIME DESPERATELY TILL IT WAS SMOOTH WITH HANDLING
HOWEVER I AM FORGETTING
I DID HAVE ONE OTHER OCCUPATION BESIDE THAT OF
SLINKING IT WAS THE ENTERTAINING OF A COLLECTOR AND BEING
ENTERTAINED BY HIM WHO HAD IN HIS HANDS THE VIRGINIA BANKER'S BILL FOR
FORTY SIX DOLLARS WHICH I HAD LOANED MY SCHOOLMATE THE PRODIGAL THIS
MAN USED TO CALL REGULARLY ONCE A WEEK AND DUN ME AND SOMETIMES OFTENER
HE DID IT FROM SHEER FORCE OF HABIT FOR HE KNEW HE COULD GET NOTHING
HE WOULD GET OUT HIS BILL CALCULATE THE INTEREST FOR ME AT FIVE PER
CENT A MONTH AND SHOW ME CLEARLY THAT THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT AT FRAUD IN
IT AND NO MISTAKES AND THEN PLEAD AND ARGUE AND DUN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
FOR ANY SUM ANY LITTLE TRIFLE EVEN A DOLLAR EVEN HALF A DOLLAR ON
ACCOUNT
THEN HIS DUTY WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND HIS CONSCIENCE FREE
HE
IMMEDIATELY DROPPED THE SUBJECT THERE ALWAYS GOT OUT A COUPLE OF CIGARS
AND DIVIDED PUT HIS FEET IN THE WINDOW AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE A LONG
LUXURIOUS TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY AND HE WOULD FURNISH ME A
WORLD OF CURIOUS DUNNING ADVENTURES OUT OF THE AMPLE STORE IN HIS MEMORY
BY AND BY HE WOULD CLAP HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD SHAKE HANDS AND SAY BRISKLY
WELL BUSINESS IS BUSINESS CAN'T STAY WITH YOU ALWAYS AND WAS OFF IN
A SECOND
THE IDEA OF PINING FOR A DUN AND YET I USED TO LONG FOR HIM TO COME
AND WOULD GET AS UNEASY AS ANY MOTHER IF THE DAY WENT BY WITHOUT HIS
VISIT WHEN I WAS EXPECTING HIM
BUT HE NEVER COLLECTED THAT BILL AT
LAST NOR ANY PART OF IT
I LIVED TO PAY IT TO THE BANKER MYSELF
MISERY LOVES COMPANY
NOW AND THEN AT NIGHT IN OUT OF THE WAY DIMLY
LIGHTED PLACES I FOUND MYSELF HAPPENING ON ANOTHER CHILD OF MISFORTUNE
HE LOOKED SO SEEDY AND FORLORN SO HOMELESS AND FRIENDLESS AND FORSAKEN
THAT I YEARNED TOWARD HIM AS A BROTHER
I WANTED TO CLAIM KINSHIP WITH
HIM AND GO ABOUT AND ENJOY OUR WRETCHEDNESS TOGETHER
THE DRAWING TOWARD
EACH OTHER MUST HAVE BEEN MUTUAL AT ANY RATE WE GOT TO FALLING TOGETHER
OFTENER THOUGH STILL SEEMINGLY BY ACCIDENT AND ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT
SPEAK OR EVINCE ANY RECOGNITION I THINK THE DULL ANXIETY PASSED OUT OF
BOTH OF US WHEN WE SAW EACH OTHER AND THEN FOR SEVERAL HOURS WE WOULD
IDLE ALONG CONTENTEDLY WIDE APART AND GLANCING FURTIVELY IN AT HOME
LIGHTS AND FIRESIDE GATHERINGS OUT OF THE NIGHT SHADOWS AND VERY MUCH
ENJOYING OUR DUMB COMPANIONSHIP
FINALLY WE SPOKE AND WERE INSEPARABLE AFTER THAT
FOR OUR WOES WERE
IDENTICAL ALMOST
HE HAD BEEN A REPORTER TOO AND LOST HIS BERTH AND
THIS WAS HIS EXPERIENCE AS NEARLY AS I CAN RECOLLECT IT
AFTER LOSING
HIS BERTH HE HAD GONE DOWN DOWN DOWN WITH NEVER A HALT FROM A
BOARDING HOUSE ON RUSSIAN HILL TO A BOARDING HOUSE IN KEARNEY STREET
FROM THENCE TO DUPONT FROM THENCE TO A LOW SAILOR DEN AND FROM THENCE
TO LODGINGS IN GOODS BOXES AND EMPTY HOGSHEADS NEAR THE WHARVES
THEN
FOR A WHILE HE HAD GAINED A MEAGRE LIVING BY SEWING UP BURSTED SACKS OF
GRAIN ON THE PIERS WHEN THAT FAILED HE HAD FOUND FOOD HERE AND THERE AS
CHANCE THREW IT IN HIS WAY
HE HAD CEASED TO SHOW HIS FACE IN DAYLIGHT
NOW FOR A REPORTER KNOWS EVERYBODY RICH AND POOR HIGH AND LOW AND
CANNOT WELL AVOID FAMILIAR FACES IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF DAY
THIS MENDICANT BLUCHER I CALL HIM THAT FOR CONVENIENCE WAS A SPLENDID
CREATURE
HE WAS FULL OF HOPE PLUCK AND PHILOSOPHY HE WAS WELL READ
AND A MAN OF CULTIVATED TASTE HE HAD A BRIGHT WIT AND WAS A MASTER OF
SATIRE HIS KINDLINESS AND HIS GENEROUS SPIRIT MADE HIM ROYAL IN MY EYES
AND CHANGED HIS CURB STONE SEAT TO A THRONE AND HIS DAMAGED HAT TO A
CROWN
HE HAD AN ADVENTURE ONCE WHICH STICKS FAST IN MY MEMORY AS THE MOST
PLEASANTLY GROTESQUE THAT EVER TOUCHED MY SYMPATHIES
HE HAD BEEN
WITHOUT A PENNY FOR TWO MONTHS
HE HAD SHIRKED ABOUT OBSCURE STREETS
AMONG FRIENDLY DIM LIGHTS TILL THE THING HAD BECOME SECOND NATURE TO
HIM
BUT AT LAST HE WAS DRIVEN ABROAD IN DAYLIGHT
THE CAUSE WAS
SUFFICIENT HE HAD NOT TASTED FOOD FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND HE COULD
NOT ENDURE THE MISERY OF HIS HUNGER IN IDLE HIDING
HE CAME ALONG A BACK
STREET GLOWERING AT THE LOAVES IN BAKE SHOP WINDOWS AND FEELING THAT HE
COULD TRADE HIS LIFE AWAY FOR A MORSEL TO EAT
THE SIGHT OF THE BREAD
DOUBLED HIS HUNGER BUT IT WAS GOOD TO LOOK AT IT ANY HOW AND IMAGINE
WHAT ONE MIGHT DO IF ONE ONLY HAD IT
PRESENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET HE SAW A SHINING SPOT LOOKED
AGAIN DID NOT AND COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS EYES TURNED AWAY TO TRY
THEM THEN LOOKED AGAIN
IT WAS A VERITY NO VAIN HUNGER INSPIRED
DELUSION IT WAS A SILVER DIME
HE SNATCHED IT GLOATED OVER IT DOUBTED IT BIT IT FOUND IT GENUINE
CHOKED HIS HEART DOWN AND SMOTHERED A HALLELUIAH
THEN HE LOOKED
AROUND SAW THAT NOBODY WAS LOOKING AT HIM THREW THE DIME DOWN WHERE IT
WAS BEFORE WALKED AWAY A FEW STEPS AND APPROACHED AGAIN PRETENDING HE
DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THERE SO THAT HE COULD RE ENJOY THE LUXURY OF
FINDING IT
HE WALKED AROUND IT VIEWING IT FROM DIFFERENT POINTS THEN
SAUNTERED ABOUT WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LOOKING UP AT THE SIGNS
AND NOW AND THEN GLANCING AT IT AND FEELING THE OLD THRILL AGAIN
FINALLY HE TOOK IT UP AND WENT AWAY FONDLING IT IN HIS POCKET
HE
IDLED THROUGH UNFREQUENTED STREETS STOPPING IN DOORWAYS AND CORNERS TO
TAKE IT OUT AND LOOK AT IT
BY AND BY HE WENT HOME TO HIS LODGINGS AN
EMPTY QUEENS WARE HOGSHEAD AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF TILL NIGHT TRYING TO
MAKE UP HIS MIND WHAT TO BUY WITH IT
BUT IT WAS HARD TO DO
TO GET THE
MOST FOR IT WAS THE IDEA
HE KNEW THAT AT THE MINER'S RESTAURANT HE
COULD GET A PLATE OF BEANS AND A PIECE OF BREAD FOR TEN CENTS OR A
FISH BALL AND SOME FEW TRIFLES BUT THEY GAVE NO BREAD WITH ONE
FISH BALL THERE
AT FRENCH PETE'S HE COULD GET A VEAL CUTLET PLAIN
AND SOME RADISHES AND BREAD FOR TEN CENTS OR A CUP OF COFFEE A PINT AT
LEAST AND A SLICE OF BREAD BUT THE SLICE WAS NOT THICK ENOUGH BY THE
EIGHTH OF AN INCH AND SOMETIMES THEY WERE STILL MORE CRIMINAL THAN THAT
IN THE CUTTING OF IT
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK HIS HUNGER WAS WOLFISH AND STILL
HIS MIND WAS NOT MADE UP
HE TURNED OUT AND WENT UP MERCHANT STREET
STILL CIPHERING AND CHEWING A BIT OF STICK AS IS THE WAY OF STARVING
MEN
HE PASSED BEFORE THE LIGHTS OF MARTIN'S RESTAURANT THE MOST ARISTOCRATIC
IN THE CITY AND STOPPED
IT WAS A PLACE WHERE HE HAD OFTEN DINED IN
BETTER DAYS AND MARTIN KNEW HIM WELL
STANDING ASIDE JUST OUT OF THE
RANGE OF THE LIGHT HE WORSHIPED THE QUAILS AND STEAKS IN THE SHOW
WINDOW AND IMAGINED THAT MAY BE THE FAIRY TIMES WERE NOT GONE YET AND
SOME PRINCE IN DISGUISE WOULD COME ALONG PRESENTLY AND TELL HIM TO GO IN
THERE AND TAKE WHATEVER HE WANTED
HE CHEWED HIS STICK WITH A HUNGRY
INTEREST AS HE WARMED TO HIS SUBJECT
JUST AT THIS JUNCTURE HE WAS
CONSCIOUS OF SOME ONE AT HIS SIDE SURE ENOUGH AND THEN A FINGER TOUCHED
HIS ARM
HE LOOKED UP OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SAW AN APPARITION A VERY
ALLEGORY OF HUNGER IT WAS A MAN SIX FEET HIGH GAUNT UNSHAVEN HUNG
WITH RAGS WITH A HAGGARD FACE AND SUNKEN CHEEKS AND EYES THAT PLEADED
PITEOUSLY
THIS PHANTOM SAID
COME WITH ME PLEASE
HE LOCKED HIS ARM IN BLUCHER'S AND WALKED UP THE STREET TO WHERE THE
PASSENGERS WERE FEW AND THE LIGHT NOT STRONG AND THEN FACING ABOUT PUT
OUT HIS HANDS IN A BESEECHING WAY AND SAID
FRIEND STRANGER LOOK AT ME LIFE IS EASY TO YOU YOU GO ABOUT PLACID
AND CONTENT AS I DID ONCE IN MY DAY YOU HAVE BEEN IN THERE AND EATEN
YOUR SUMPTUOUS SUPPER AND PICKED YOUR TEETH AND HUMMED YOUR TUNE AND
THOUGHT YOUR PLEASANT THOUGHTS AND SAID TO YOURSELF IT IS A GOOD WORLD
BUT YOU'VE NEVER SUFFERED YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TROUBLE IS YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT MISERY IS NOR HUNGER LOOK AT ME STRANGER HAVE PITY ON A
POOR FRIENDLESS HOMELESS DOG AS GOD IS MY JUDGE I HAVE NOT TASTED
FOOD FOR EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS LOOK IN MY EYES AND SEE IF I LIE GIVE
ME THE LEAST TRIFLE IN THE WORLD TO KEEP ME FROM STARVING ANYTHING
TWENTY FIVE CENTS DO IT STRANGER DO IT PLEASE
IT WILL BE NOTHING
TO YOU BUT LIFE TO ME
DO IT AND I WILL GO DOWN ON MY KNEES AND LICK
THE DUST BEFORE YOU I WILL KISS YOUR FOOTPRINTS I WILL WORSHIP THE
VERY GROUND YOU WALK ON ONLY TWENTY FIVE CENTS I AM FAMISHING
PERISHING STARVING BY INCHES FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T DESERT ME
BLUCHER WAS BEWILDERED AND TOUCHED TOO STIRRED TO THE DEPTHS
HE
REFLECTED
THOUGHT AGAIN
THEN AN IDEA STRUCK HIM AND HE SAID
COME WITH ME
HE TOOK THE OUTCAST'S ARM WALKED HIM DOWN TO MARTIN'S RESTAURANT SEATED
HIM AT A MARBLE TABLE PLACED THE BILL OF FARE BEFORE HIM AND SAID
ORDER WHAT YOU WANT FRIEND
CHARGE IT TO ME MR
MARTIN
ALL RIGHT MR
BLUCHER SAID MARTIN
THEN BLUCHER STEPPED BACK AND LEANED AGAINST THE COUNTER AND WATCHED THE
MAN STOW AWAY CARGO AFTER CARGO OF BUCKWHEAT CAKES AT SEVENTY FIVE CENTS
A PLATE CUP AFTER CUP OF COFFEE AND PORTER HOUSE STEAKS WORTH TWO
DOLLARS APIECE AND WHEN SIX DOLLARS AND A HALF'S WORTH OF DESTRUCTION
HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND THE STRANGER'S HUNGER APPEASED BLUCHER WENT
DOWN TO FRENCH PETE'S BOUGHT A VEAL CUTLET PLAIN A SLICE OF BREAD AND
THREE RADISHES WITH HIS DIME AND SET TO AND FEASTED LIKE A KING
TAKE THE EPISODE ALL AROUND IT WAS AS ODD AS ANY THAT CAN BE CULLED FROM
THE MYRIAD CURIOSITIES OF CALIFORNIAN LIFE PERHAPS
CHAPTER LX
BY AND BY AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE A MINER CAME DOWN FROM ONE OF THE
DECAYED MINING CAMPS OF TUOLUMNE CALIFORNIA AND I WENT BACK WITH HIM
WE LIVED IN A SMALL CABIN ON A VERDANT HILLSIDE AND THERE WERE NOT FIVE
OTHER CABINS IN VIEW OVER THE WIDE EXPANSE OF HILL AND FOREST
YET A
FLOURISHING CITY OF TWO OR THREE THOUSAND POPULATION HAD OCCUPIED THIS
GRASSY DEAD SOLITUDE DURING THE FLUSH TIMES OF TWELVE OR FIFTEEN YEARS
BEFORE AND WHERE OUR CABIN STOOD HAD ONCE BEEN THE HEART OF THE TEEMING
HIVE THE CENTRE OF THE CITY
WHEN THE MINES GAVE OUT THE TOWN FELL INTO
DECAY AND IN A FEW YEARS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED STREETS DWELLINGS SHOPS
EVERYTHING AND LEFT NO SIGN
THE GRASSY SLOPES WERE AS GREEN AND SMOOTH
AND DESOLATE OF LIFE AS IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN DISTURBED
THE MERE
HANDFUL OF MINERS STILL REMAINING HAD SEEN THE TOWN SPRING UP SPREAD
GROW AND FLOURISH IN ITS PRIDE AND THEY HAD SEEN IT SICKEN AND DIE AND
PASS AWAY LIKE A DREAM
WITH IT THEIR HOPES HAD DIED AND THEIR ZEST OF
LIFE
THEY HAD LONG AGO RESIGNED THEMSELVES TO THEIR EXILE AND CEASED
TO CORRESPOND WITH THEIR DISTANT FRIENDS OR TURN LONGING EYES TOWARD
THEIR EARLY HOMES
THEY HAD ACCEPTED BANISHMENT FORGOTTEN THE WORLD AND
BEEN FORGOTTEN OF THE WORLD
THEY WERE FAR FROM TELEGRAPHS AND
RAILROADS AND THEY STOOD AS IT WERE IN A LIVING GRAVE DEAD TO THE
EVENTS THAT STIRRED THE GLOBE'S GREAT POPULATIONS DEAD TO THE COMMON
INTERESTS OF MEN ISOLATED AND OUTCAST FROM BROTHERHOOD WITH THEIR KIND
IT WAS THE MOST SINGULAR AND ALMOST THE MOST TOUCHING AND MELANCHOLY
EXILE THAT FANCY CAN IMAGINE ONE OF MY ASSOCIATES IN THIS LOCALITY FOR
TWO OR THREE MONTHS WAS A MAN WHO HAD HAD A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION BUT
NOW FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS HE HAD DECAYED THERE BY INCHES A BEARDED
ROUGH CLAD CLAY STAINED MINER AND AT TIMES AMONG HIS SIGHINGS AND
SOLILOQUIZINGS HE UNCONSCIOUSLY INTERJECTED VAGUELY REMEMBERED LATIN AND
GREEK SENTENCES DEAD AND MUSTY TONGUES MEET VEHICLES FOR THE THOUGHTS
OF ONE WHOSE DREAMS WERE ALL OF THE PAST WHOSE LIFE WAS A FAILURE A
TIRED MAN BURDENED WITH THE PRESENT AND INDIFFERENT TO THE FUTURE A
MAN WITHOUT TIES HOPES INTERESTS WAITING FOR REST AND THE END
IN THAT ONE LITTLE CORNER OF CALIFORNIA IS FOUND A SPECIES OF MINING
WHICH IS SELDOM OR NEVER MENTIONED IN PRINT
IT IS CALLED POCKET
MINING AND I AM NOT AWARE THAT ANY OF IT IS DONE OUTSIDE OF THAT LITTLE
CORNER
THE GOLD IS NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE SURFACE DIRT AS
IN ORDINARY PLACER MINES BUT IS COLLECTED IN LITTLE SPOTS AND THEY ARE
VERY WIDE APART AND EXCEEDINGLY HARD TO FIND BUT WHEN YOU DO FIND ONE
YOU REAP A RICH AND SUDDEN HARVEST
THERE ARE NOT NOW MORE THAN TWENTY
POCKET MINERS IN THAT ENTIRE LITTLE REGION
I THINK I KNOW EVERY ONE OF
THEM PERSONALLY
I HAVE KNOWN ONE OF THEM TO HUNT PATIENTLY ABOUT THE
HILL SIDES EVERY DAY FOR EIGHT MONTHS WITHOUT FINDING GOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE
A SNUFF BOX HIS GROCERY BILL RUNNING UP RELENTLESSLY ALL THE TIME AND
THEN FIND A POCKET AND TAKE OUT OF IT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO DIPS OF
HIS SHOVEL
I HAVE KNOWN HIM TO TAKE OUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TWO
HOURS AND GO AND PAY UP EVERY CENT OF HIS INDEBTEDNESS THEN ENTER ON A
DAZZLING SPREE THAT FINISHED THE LAST OF HIS TREASURE BEFORE THE NIGHT
WAS GONE
AND THE NEXT DAY HE BOUGHT HIS GROCERIES ON CREDIT AS USUAL
AND SHOULDERED HIS PAN AND SHOVEL AND WENT OFF TO THE HILLS HUNTING
POCKETS AGAIN HAPPY AND CONTENT
THIS IS THE MOST FASCINATING OF ALL THE
DIFFERENT KINDS OF MINING AND FURNISHES A VERY HANDSOME PERCENTAGE OF
VICTIMS TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM
POCKET HUNTING IS AN INGENIOUS PROCESS
YOU TAKE A SPADEFUL OF EARTH
FROM THE HILL SIDE AND PUT IT IN A LARGE TIN PAN AND DISSOLVE AND WASH IT
GRADUALLY AWAY TILL NOTHING IS LEFT BUT A TEASPOONFUL OF FINE SEDIMENT
WHATEVER GOLD WAS IN THAT EARTH HAS REMAINED BECAUSE BEING THE
HEAVIEST IT HAS SOUGHT THE BOTTOM
AMONG THE SEDIMENT YOU WILL FIND
HALF A DOZEN YELLOW PARTICLES NO LARGER THAN PIN HEADS
YOU ARE
DELIGHTED
YOU MOVE OFF TO ONE SIDE AND WASH ANOTHER PAN
IF YOU FIND
GOLD AGAIN YOU MOVE TO ONE SIDE FURTHER AND WASH A THIRD PAN
IF YOU
FIND NO GOLD THIS TIME YOU ARE DELIGHTED AGAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE
ON THE RIGHT SCENT
YOU LAY AN IMAGINARY PLAN SHAPED LIKE A FAN WITH ITS HANDLE UP THE
HILL FOR JUST WHERE THE END OF THE HANDLE IS YOU ARGUE THAT THE RICH
DEPOSIT LIES HIDDEN WHOSE VAGRANT GRAINS OF GOLD HAVE ESCAPED AND BEEN
WASHED DOWN THE HILL SPREADING FARTHER AND FARTHER APART AS THEY
WANDERED
AND SO YOU PROCEED UP THE HILL WASHING THE EARTH AND
NARROWING YOUR LINES EVERY TIME THE ABSENCE OF GOLD IN THE PAN SHOWS THAT
YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE SPREAD OF THE FAN AND AT LAST TWENTY YARDS UP THE
HILL YOUR LINES HAVE CONVERGED TO A POINT A SINGLE FOOT FROM THAT POINT
YOU CANNOT FIND ANY GOLD
YOUR BREATH COMES SHORT AND QUICK YOU ARE
FEVERISH WITH EXCITEMENT THE DINNER BELL MAY RING ITS CLAPPER OFF YOU
PAY NO ATTENTION FRIENDS MAY DIE WEDDINGS TRANSPIRE HOUSES BURN DOWN
THEY ARE NOTHING TO YOU YOU SWEAT AND DIG AND DELVE WITH A FRANTIC
INTEREST AND ALL AT ONCE YOU STRIKE IT UP COMES A SPADEFUL OF EARTH
AND QUARTZ THAT IS ALL LOVELY WITH SOILED LUMPS AND LEAVES AND SPRAYS OF
GOLD
SOMETIMES THAT ONE SPADEFUL IS ALL 500
SOMETIMES THE NEST
CONTAINS 10 000 AND IT TAKES YOU THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO GET IT ALL OUT
THE POCKET MINERS TELL OF ONE NEST THAT YIELDED 60 000 AND TWO MEN
EXHAUSTED IT IN TWO WEEKS AND THEN SOLD THE GROUND FOR 10 000 TO A
PARTY WHO NEVER GOT 300 OUT OF IT AFTERWARD
THE HOGS ARE GOOD POCKET HUNTERS
ALL THE SUMMER THEY ROOT AROUND THE
BUSHES AND TURN UP A THOUSAND LITTLE PILES OF DIRT AND THEN THE MINERS
LONG FOR THE RAINS FOR THE RAINS BEAT UPON THESE LITTLE PILES AND WASH
THEM DOWN AND EXPOSE THE GOLD POSSIBLY RIGHT OVER A POCKET
TWO POCKETS
WERE FOUND IN THIS WAY BY THE SAME MAN IN ONE DAY
ONE HAD 5 000 IN IT
AND THE OTHER 8 000
THAT MAN COULD APPRECIATE IT FOR HE HADN'T HAD A
CENT FOR ABOUT A YEAR
IN TUOLUMNE LIVED TWO MINERS WHO USED TO GO TO THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGE IN
THE AFTERNOON AND RETURN EVERY NIGHT WITH HOUSEHOLD SUPPLIES
PART OF
THE DISTANCE THEY TRAVERSED A TRAIL AND NEARLY ALWAYS SAT DOWN TO REST
ON A GREAT BOULDER THAT LAY BESIDE THE PATH
IN THE COURSE OF THIRTEEN
YEARS THEY HAD WORN THAT BOULDER TOLERABLY SMOOTH SITTING ON IT
BY AND
BY TWO VAGRANT MEXICANS CAME ALONG AND OCCUPIED THE SEAT
THEY BEGAN TO
AMUSE THEMSELVES BY CHIPPING OFF FLAKES FROM THE BOULDER WITH A
SLEDGE HAMMER
THEY EXAMINED ONE OF THESE FLAKES AND FOUND IT RICH WITH
GOLD
THAT BOULDER PAID THEM 800 AFTERWARD
BUT THE AGGRAVATING
CIRCUMSTANCE WAS THAT THESE GREASERS KNEW THAT THERE MUST BE MORE GOLD
WHERE THAT BOULDER CAME FROM AND SO THEY WENT PANNING UP THE HILL AND
FOUND WHAT WAS PROBABLY THE RICHEST POCKET THAT REGION HAS YET PRODUCED
IT TOOK THREE MONTHS TO EXHAUST IT AND IT YIELDED 120 000
THE TWO
AMERICAN MINERS WHO USED TO SIT ON THE BOULDER ARE POOR YET AND THEY
TAKE TURN ABOUT IN GETTING UP EARLY IN THE MORNING TO CURSE THOSE
MEXICANS AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO PURE ORNAMENTAL CURSING THE NATIVE
AMERICAN IS GIFTED ABOVE THE SONS OF MEN
I HAVE DWELT AT SOME LENGTH UPON THIS MATTER OF POCKET MINING BECAUSE IT
IS A SUBJECT THAT IS SELDOM REFERRED TO IN PRINT AND THEREFORE I JUDGED
THAT IT WOULD HAVE FOR THE READER THAT INTEREST WHICH NATURALLY ATTACHES
TO NOVELTY
CHAPTER LXI
ONE OF MY COMRADES THERE ANOTHER OF THOSE VICTIMS OF EIGHTEEN YEARS OF
UNREQUITED TOIL AND BLIGHTED HOPES WAS ONE OF THE GENTLEST SPIRITS THAT
EVER BORE ITS PATIENT CROSS IN A WEARY EXILE GRAVE AND SIMPLE DICK
BAKER POCKET MINER OF DEAD HOUSE GULCH HE WAS FORTY SIX GRAY AS A
RAT EARNEST THOUGHTFUL SLENDERLY EDUCATED SLOUCHILY DRESSED AND
CLAY SOILED BUT HIS HEART WAS FINER METAL THAN ANY GOLD HIS SHOVEL EVER
BROUGHT TO LIGHT THAN ANY INDEED THAT EVER WAS MINED OR MINTED
WHENEVER HE WAS OUT OF LUCK AND A LITTLE DOWN HEARTED HE WOULD FALL TO
MOURNING OVER THE LOSS OF A WONDERFUL CAT HE USED TO OWN FOR WHERE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN ARE NOT MEN OF KINDLY IMPULSES TAKE UP WITH PETS FOR THEY
MUST LOVE SOMETHING
AND HE ALWAYS SPOKE OF THE STRANGE SAGACITY OF
THAT CAT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO BELIEVED IN HIS SECRET HEART THAT
THERE WAS SOMETHING HUMAN ABOUT IT MAY BE EVEN SUPERNATURAL
I HEARD HIM TALKING ABOUT THIS ANIMAL ONCE
HE SAID
GENTLEMEN I USED TO HAVE A CAT HERE BY THE NAME OF TOM QUARTZ WHICH
YOU'D A TOOK AN INTEREST IN I RECKON MOST ANY BODY WOULD
I HAD HIM
HERE EIGHT YEAR AND HE WAS THE REMARKABLEST CAT I EVER SEE
HE WAS A
LARGE GRAY ONE OF THE TOM SPECIE AN' HE HAD MORE HARD NATCHRAL SENSE
THAN ANY MAN IN THIS CAMP 'N' A POWER OF DIGNITY HE WOULDN'T LET THE
GOV'NER OF CALIFORNY BE FAMILIAR WITH HIM
HE NEVER KETCHED A RAT IN HIS
LIFE 'PEARED TO BE ABOVE IT
HE NEVER CARED FOR NOTHING BUT MINING
HE KNOWED MORE ABOUT MINING THAT CAT DID THAN ANY MAN I EVER EVER SEE
YOU COULDN'T TELL HIM NOTH'N 'BOUT PLACER DIGGIN'S 'N' AS FOR POCKET
MINING WHY HE WAS JUST BORN FOR IT
HE WOULD DIG OUT AFTER ME AN' JIM WHEN WE WENT OVER THE HILLS
PROSPECT'N' AND HE WOULD TROT ALONG BEHIND US FOR AS MUCH AS FIVE MILE
IF WE WENT SO FUR
AN' HE HAD THE BEST JUDGMENT ABOUT MINING GROUND WHY
YOU NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT
WHEN WE WENT TO WORK HE'D SCATTER A
GLANCE AROUND 'N' IF HE DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF THE INDICATIONS HE WOULD
GIVE A LOOK AS MUCH AS TO SAY 'WELL I'LL HAVE TO GET YOU TO EXCUSE ME
'N' WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE'D HYSTE HIS NOSE INTO THE AIR 'N' SHOVE FOR
HOME
BUT IF THE GROUND SUITED HIM HE WOULD LAY LOW 'N' KEEP DARK TILL
THE FIRST PAN WAS WASHED 'N' THEN HE WOULD SIDLE UP 'N' TAKE A LOOK AN'
IF THERE WAS ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS OF GOLD HE WAS SATISFIED HE
DIDN'T WANT NO BETTER PROSPECT 'N' THAT 'N' THEN HE WOULD LAY DOWN ON
OUR COATS AND SNORE LIKE A STEAMBOAT TILL WE'D STRUCK THE POCKET AN'
THEN GET UP 'N' SUPERINTEND
HE WAS NEARLY LIGHTNIN' ON SUPERINTENDING
WELL BYE AN' BYE UP COMES THIS YER QUARTZ EXCITEMENT
EVERY BODY WAS
INTO IT EVERY BODY WAS PICK'N' 'N' BLAST'N' INSTEAD OF SHOVELIN' DIRT ON
THE HILL SIDE EVERY BODY WAS PUT'N' DOWN A SHAFT INSTEAD OF SCRAPIN' THE
SURFACE
NOTH'N' WOULD DO JIM BUT WE MUST TACKLE THE LEDGES TOO 'N'
SO WE DID
WE COMMENCED PUT'N' DOWN A SHAFT 'N' TOM QUARTZ HE BEGIN TO
WONDER WHAT IN THE DICKENS IT WAS ALL ABOUT
HE HADN'T EVER SEEN ANY
MINING LIKE THAT BEFORE 'N' HE WAS ALL UPSET AS YOU MAY SAY HE
COULDN'T COME TO A RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF IT NO WAY IT WAS TOO MANY FOR
HIM
HE WAS DOWN ON IT TOO YOU BET YOU HE WAS DOWN ON IT POWERFUL
'N' ALWAYS APPEARED TO CONSIDER IT THE CUSSEDEST FOOLISHNESS OUT
BUT
THAT CAT YOU KNOW WAS ALWAYS AGIN NEW FANGLED ARRANGEMENTS SOMEHOW HE
NEVER COULD ABIDE'EM
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH OLD HABITS
BUT BY AN' BY
TOM QUARTZ BEGIN TO GIT SORT OF RECONCILED A LITTLE THOUGH HE NEVER
COULD ALTOGETHER UNDERSTAND THAT ETERNAL SINKIN' OF A SHAFT AN' NEVER
PANNIN' OUT ANY THING
AT LAST HE GOT TO COMIN' DOWN IN THE SHAFT
HISSELF TO TRY TO CIPHER IT OUT
AN' WHEN HE'D GIT THE BLUES 'N' FEEL
KIND O'SCRUFFY 'N' AGGRAVATED 'N' DISGUSTED KNOWIN' AS HE DID THAT THE
BILLS WAS RUNNIN' UP ALL THE TIME AN' WE WARN'T MAKIN' A CENT HE WOULD
CURL UP ON A GUNNY SACK IN THE CORNER AN' GO TO SLEEP
WELL ONE DAY
WHEN THE SHAFT WAS DOWN ABOUT EIGHT FOOT THE ROCK GOT SO HARD THAT WE
HAD TO PUT IN A BLAST THE FIRST BLAST'N' WE'D EVER DONE SINCE TOM QUARTZ
WAS BORN
AN' THEN WE LIT THE FUSE 'N' CLUMB OUT 'N' GOT OFF 'BOUT FIFTY
YARDS 'N' FORGOT 'N' LEFT TOM QUARTZ SOUND ASLEEP ON THE GUNNY SACK
IN 'BOUT A MINUTE WE SEEN A PUFF OF SMOKE BUST UP OUT OF THE HOLE 'N'
THEN EVERYTHING LET GO WITH AN AWFUL CRASH 'N' ABOUT FOUR MILLION TON OF
ROCKS 'N' DIRT 'N' SMOKE 'N SPLINTERS SHOT UP 'BOUT A MILE AN' A HALF
INTO THE AIR AN' BY GEORGE RIGHT IN THE DEAD CENTRE OF IT WAS OLD TOM
QUARTZ A GOIN' END OVER END AN' A SNORTIN' AN' A SNEEZ'N' AN' A CLAWIN'
AN' A REACHIN' FOR THINGS LIKE ALL POSSESSED
BUT IT WARN'T NO USE YOU
KNOW IT WARN'T NO USE
AN' THAT WAS THE LAST WE SEE OF HIM FOR ABOUT
TWO MINUTES 'N' A HALF AN' THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT BEGIN TO RAIN ROCKS
AND RUBBAGE AN' DIRECTLY HE COME DOWN KER WHOP ABOUT TEN FOOT OFF F'M
WHERE WE STOOD WELL I RECKON HE WAS P'RAPS THE ORNERIEST LOOKIN' BEAST
YOU EVER SEE
ONE EAR WAS SOT BACK ON HIS NECK 'N' HIS TAIL WAS STOVE
UP 'N' HIS EYE WINKERS WAS SWINGED OFF 'N' HE WAS ALL BLACKED UP WITH
POWDER AN' SMOKE AN' ALL SLOPPY WITH MUD 'N' SLUSH F'M ONE END TO THE
OTHER
WELL SIR IT WARN'T NO USE TO TRY TO APOLOGIZE WE COULDN'T SAY A WORD
HE TOOK A SORT OF A DISGUSTED LOOK AT HISSELF 'N' THEN HE LOOKED AT US
AN' IT WAS JUST EXACTLY THE SAME AS IF HE HAD SAID 'GENTS MAY BE YOU
THINK IT'S SMART TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A CAT THAT 'AIN'T HAD NO EXPERIENCE
OF QUARTZ MININ' BUT I THINK DIFFERENT' AN' THEN HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL
'N' MARCHED OFF HOME WITHOUT EVER SAYING ANOTHER WORD
THAT WAS JEST HIS STYLE
AN' MAY BE YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT BUT AFTER
THAT YOU NEVER SEE A CAT SO PREJUDICED AGIN QUARTZ MINING AS WHAT HE WAS
AN' BY AN' BYE WHEN HE DID GET TO GOIN' DOWN IN THE SHAFT AGIN YOU'D 'A
BEEN ASTONISHED AT HIS SAGACITY
THE MINUTE WE'D TETCH OFF A BLAST 'N'
THE FUSE'D BEGIN TO SIZZLE HE'D GIVE A LOOK AS MUCH AS TO SAY 'WELL
I'LL HAVE TO GIT YOU TO EXCUSE ME AN' IT WAS SURPRIS'N' THE WAY HE'D
SHIN OUT OF THAT HOLE 'N' GO F'R A TREE
SAGACITY IT AIN'T NO NAME FOR
IT
'TWAS INSPIRATION
I SAID WELL MR
BAKER HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST QUARTZ MINING WAS
REMARKABLE CONSIDERING HOW HE CAME BY IT
COULDN'T YOU EVER CURE HIM OF
IT
CURE HIM NO WHEN TOM QUARTZ WAS SOT ONCE HE WAS ALWAYS SOT AND YOU
MIGHT A BLOWED HIM UP AS MUCH AS THREE MILLION TIMES 'N' YOU'D NEVER A
BROKEN HIM OF HIS CUSSED PREJUDICE AGIN QUARTZ MINING
THE AFFECTION AND THE PRIDE THAT LIT UP BAKER'S FACE WHEN HE DELIVERED
THIS TRIBUTE TO THE FIRMNESS OF HIS HUMBLE FRIEND OF OTHER DAYS WILL
ALWAYS BE A VIVID MEMORY WITH ME
AT THE END OF TWO MONTHS WE HAD NEVER STRUCK A POCKET
WE HAD PANNED
UP AND DOWN THE HILLSIDES TILL THEY LOOKED PLOWED LIKE A FIELD WE COULD
HAVE PUT IN A CROP OF GRAIN THEN BUT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WAY TO
GET IT TO MARKET
WE GOT MANY GOOD PROSPECTS BUT WHEN THE GOLD GAVE
OUT IN THE PAN AND WE DUG DOWN HOPING AND LONGING WE FOUND ONLY
EMPTINESS THE POCKET THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE WAS AS BARREN AS OUR
OWN AT LAST WE SHOULDERED OUR PANS AND SHOVELS AND STRUCK OUT OVER THE
HILLS TO TRY NEW LOCALITIES
WE PROSPECTED AROUND ANGEL'S CAMP IN
CALAVERAS COUNTY DURING THREE WEEKS BUT HAD NO SUCCESS
THEN WE
WANDERED ON FOOT AMONG THE MOUNTAINS SLEEPING UNDER THE TREES AT NIGHT
FOR THE WEATHER WAS MILD BUT STILL WE REMAINED AS CENTLESS AS THE LAST
ROSE OF SUMMER
THAT IS A POOR JOKE BUT IT IS IN PATHETIC HARMONY WITH
THE CIRCUMSTANCES SINCE WE WERE SO POOR OURSELVES
IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY OUR DOOR HAD ALWAYS STOOD OPEN AND OUR BOARD
WELCOME TO TRAMPING MINERS THEY DRIFTED ALONG NEARLY EVERY DAY DUMPED
THEIR PAUST SHOVELS BY THE THRESHOLD AND TOOK POT LUCK WITH US AND NOW
ON OUR OWN TRAMP WE NEVER FOUND COLD HOSPITALITY
OUR WANDERINGS WERE WIDE AND IN MANY DIRECTIONS AND NOW I COULD GIVE THE
READER A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE BIG TREES AND THE MARVELS OF THE YO
SEMITE BUT WHAT HAS THIS READER DONE TO ME THAT I SHOULD PERSECUTE HIM
I WILL DELIVER HIM INTO THE HANDS OF LESS CONSCIENTIOUS TOURISTS AND TAKE
HIS BLESSING
LET ME BE CHARITABLE THOUGH I FAIL IN ALL VIRTUES ELSE
NOTE SOME OF THE PHRASES IN THE ABOVE ARE MINING TECHNICALITIES PURELY
AND MAY BE A LITTLE OBSCURE TO THE GENERAL READER
IN PLACER DIGGINGS
THE GOLD IS SCATTERED ALL THROUGH THE SURFACE DIRT IN POCKET DIGGINGS
IT IS CONCENTRATED IN ONE LITTLE SPOT IN QUARTZ THE GOLD IS IN A
SOLID CONTINUOUS VEIN OF ROCK ENCLOSED BETWEEN DISTINCT WALLS OF SOME
OTHER KIND OF STONE AND THIS IS THE MOST LABORIOUS AND EXPENSIVE OF ALL
THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MINING
PROSPECTING IS HUNTING FOR A PLACER
INDICATIONS ARE SIGNS OF ITS PRESENCE PANNING OUT REFERS TO THE

CHAPTER LXII
AFTER A THREE MONTHS' ABSENCE I FOUND MYSELF IN SAN FRANCISCO AGAIN
WITHOUT A CENT
WHEN MY CREDIT WAS ABOUT EXHAUSTED FOR I HAD BECOME
TOO MEAN AND LAZY NOW TO WORK ON A MORNING PAPER AND THERE WERE NO
VACANCIES ON THE EVENING JOURNALS I WAS CREATED SAN FRANCISCO
CORRESPONDENT OF THE ENTERPRISE AND AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS I WAS OUT
OF DEBT BUT MY INTEREST IN MY WORK WAS GONE FOR MY CORRESPONDENCE BEING
A DAILY ONE WITHOUT REST OR RESPITE I GOT UNSPEAKABLY TIRED OF IT
I WANTED ANOTHER CHANGE
THE VAGABOND INSTINCT WAS STRONG UPON ME
FORTUNE FAVORED AND I GOT A NEW BERTH AND A DELIGHTFUL ONE
IT WAS TO GO
DOWN TO THE SANDWICH ISLANDS AND WRITE SOME LETTERS FOR THE SACRAMENTO
UNION AN EXCELLENT JOURNAL AND LIBERAL WITH EMPLOYEES
WE SAILED IN THE PROPELLER AJAX IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER
THE ALMANAC
CALLED IT WINTER DISTINCTLY ENOUGH BUT THE WEATHER WAS A COMPROMISE
BETWEEN SPRING AND SUMMER
SIX DAYS OUT OF PORT IT BECAME SUMMER
ALTOGETHER
WE HAD SOME THIRTY PASSENGERS AMONG THEM A CHEERFUL SOUL
BY THE NAME OF WILLIAMS AND THREE SEA WORN OLD WHALESHIP CAPTAINS GOING
DOWN TO JOIN THEIR VESSELS
THESE LATTER PLAYED EUCHRE IN THE SMOKING
ROOM DAY AND NIGHT DRANK ASTONISHING QUANTITIES OF RAW WHISKY WITHOUT
BEING IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT AND WERE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE I THINK
I EVER SAW
AND THEN THERE WAS THE OLD ADMIRAL A RETIRED WHALEMAN
HE WAS A ROARING TERRIFIC COMBINATION OF WIND AND LIGHTNING AND THUNDER
AND EARNEST WHOLE SOULED PROFANITY
BUT NEVERTHELESS HE WAS
TENDER HEARTED AS A GIRL
HE WAS A RAVING DEAFENING DEVASTATING
TYPHOON LAYING WASTE THE COWERING SEAS BUT WITH AN UNVEXED REFUGE IN THE
CENTRE WHERE ALL COMERS WERE SAFE AND AT REST
NOBODY COULD KNOW THE
ADMIRAL WITHOUT LIKING HIM AND IN A SUDDEN AND DIRE EMERGENCY I THINK
NO FRIEND OF HIS WOULD KNOW WHICH TO CHOOSE TO BE CURSED BY HIM OR
PRAYED FOR BY A LESS EFFICIENT PERSON
HIS TITLE OF ADMIRAL WAS MORE STRICTLY OFFICIAL THAN ANY EVER WORN BY
A NAVAL OFFICER BEFORE OR SINCE PERHAPS FOR IT WAS THE VOLUNTARY
OFFERING OF A WHOLE NATION AND CAME DIRECT FROM THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
WITHOUT ANY INTERMEDIATE RED TAPE THE PEOPLE OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
IT WAS A TITLE THAT CAME TO HIM FREIGHTED WITH AFFECTION AND HONOR AND
APPRECIATION OF HIS UNPRETENDING MERIT
AND IN TESTIMONY OF THE
GENUINENESS OF THE TITLE IT WAS PUBLICLY ORDAINED THAT AN EXCLUSIVE FLAG
SHOULD BE DEVISED FOR HIM AND USED SOLELY TO WELCOME HIS COMING AND WAVE
HIM GOD SPEED IN HIS GOING
FROM THAT TIME FORTH WHENEVER HIS SHIP WAS
SIGNALED IN THE OFFING OR HE CATTED HIS ANCHOR AND STOOD OUT TO SEA
THAT ENSIGN STREAMED FROM THE ROYAL HALLIARDS ON THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE AND
THE NATION LIFTED THEIR HATS TO IT WITH SPONTANEOUS ACCORD
YET HE HAD NEVER FIRED A GUN OR FOUGHT A BATTLE IN HIS LIFE
WHEN I KNEW
HIM ON BOARD THE AJAX HE WAS SEVENTY TWO YEARS OLD AND HAD PLOWED THE
SALT WATER SIXTY ONE OF THEM
FOR SIXTEEN YEARS HE HAD GONE IN AND OUT
OF THE HARBOR OF HONOLULU IN COMMAND OF A WHALESHIP AND FOR SIXTEEN MORE
HAD BEEN CAPTAIN OF A SAN FRANCISCO AND SANDWICH ISLAND PASSENGER PACKET
AND HAD NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT OR LOST A VESSEL
THE SIMPLE NATIVES KNEW
HIM FOR A FRIEND WHO NEVER FAILED THEM AND REGARDED HIM AS CHILDREN
REGARD A FATHER
IT WAS A DANGEROUS THING TO OPPRESS THEM WHEN THE
ROARING ADMIRAL WAS AROUND
TWO YEARS BEFORE I KNEW THE ADMIRAL HE HAD RETIRED FROM THE SEA ON A
COMPETENCE AND HAD SWORN A COLOSSAL NINE JOINTED OATH THAT HE WOULD
NEVER GO WITHIN SMELLING DISTANCE OF THE SALT WATER AGAIN AS LONG AS HE
LIVED AND HE HAD CONSCIENTIOUSLY KEPT IT
THAT IS TO SAY HE
CONSIDERED HE HAD KEPT IT AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN DANGEROUS TO
SUGGEST TO HIM EVEN IN THE GENTLEST WAY THAT MAKING ELEVEN LONG SEA
VOYAGES AS A PASSENGER DURING THE TWO YEARS THAT HAD TRANSPIRED SINCE
HE RETIRED WAS ONLY KEEPING THE GENERAL SPIRIT OF IT AND NOT THE
STRICT LETTER
THE ADMIRAL KNEW ONLY ONE NARROW LINE OF CONDUCT TO PURSUE IN ANY AND ALL
CASES WHERE THERE WAS A FIGHT AND THAT WAS TO SHOULDER HIS WAY STRAIGHT
IN WITHOUT AN INQUIRY AS TO THE RIGHTS OR THE MERITS OF IT AND TAKE THE
PART OF THE WEAKER SIDE AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HE WAS ALWAYS SURE
TO BE PRESENT AT THE TRIAL OF ANY UNIVERSALLY EXECRATED CRIMINAL TO
OPPRESS AND INTIMIDATE THE JURY WITH A VINDICTIVE PANTOMIME OF WHAT HE
WOULD DO TO THEM IF HE EVER CAUGHT THEM OUT OF THE BOX
AND THIS WAS WHY
HARRIED CATS AND OUTLAWED DOGS THAT KNEW HIM CONFIDENTLY TOOK SANCTUARY
UNDER HIS CHAIR IN TIME OF TROUBLE
IN THE BEGINNING HE WAS THE MOST
FRANTIC AND BLOODTHIRSTY UNION MAN THAT DREW BREATH IN THE SHADOW OF THE
FLAG BUT THE INSTANT THE SOUTHERNERS BEGAN TO GO DOWN BEFORE THE SWEEP
OF THE NORTHERN ARMIES HE RAN UP THE CONFEDERATE COLORS AND FROM THAT
TIME TILL THE END WAS A RAMPANT AND INEXORABLE SECESSIONIST
HE HATED INTEMPERANCE WITH A MORE UNCOMPROMISING ANIMOSITY THAN ANY
INDIVIDUAL I HAVE EVER MET OF EITHER SEX AND HE WAS NEVER TIRED OF
STORMING AGAINST IT AND BESEECHING FRIENDS AND STRANGERS ALIKE TO BE WARY
AND DRINK WITH MODERATION
AND YET IF ANY CREATURE HAD BEEN GUILELESS
ENOUGH TO INTIMATE THAT HIS ABSORBING NINE GALLONS OF STRAIGHT WHISKEY
DURING OUR VOYAGE WAS ANY FRACTION SHORT OF RIGID OR INFLEXIBLE
ABSTEMIOUSNESS IN THAT SELF SAME MOMENT THE OLD MAN WOULD HAVE SPUN HIM
TO THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE EARTH IN THE WHIRLWIND OF HIS WRATH
MIND
I AM NOT SAYING HIS WHISKY EVER AFFECTED HIS HEAD OR HIS LEGS FOR IT DID
NOT IN EVEN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE
HE WAS A CAPACIOUS CONTAINER BUT HE
DID NOT HOLD ENOUGH FOR THAT
HE TOOK A LEVEL TUMBLERFUL OF WHISKY EVERY
MORNING BEFORE HE PUT HIS CLOTHES ON TO SWEETEN HIS BILGEWATER HE
SAID HE TOOK ANOTHER AFTER HE GOT THE MOST OF HIS CLOTHES ON TO
SETTLE HIS MIND AND GIVE HIM HIS BEARINGS HE THEN SHAVED AND PUT ON A
CLEAN SHIRT AFTER WHICH HE RECITED THE LORD'S PRAYER IN A FERVENT
THUNDERING BASS THAT SHOOK THE SHIP TO HER KELSON AND SUSPENDED ALL
CONVERSATION IN THE MAIN CABIN
THEN AT THIS STAGE BEING INVARIABLY
BY THE HEAD OR BY THE STERN OR LISTED TO PORT OR STARBOARD HE
TOOK ONE MORE TO PUT HIM ON AN EVEN KEEL SO THAT HE WOULD MIND HIS
HELLUM AND NOT MISS STAYS AND GO ABOUT EVERY TIME HE CAME UP IN THE
WIND AND NOW HIS STATE ROOM DOOR SWUNG OPEN AND THE SUN OF HIS
BENIGNANT FACE BEAMED REDLY OUT UPON MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND HE
ROARED HIS SHIPMETS A'HOY IN A WAY THAT WAS CALCULATED TO WAKE THE
DEAD AND PRECIPITATE THE FINAL RESURRECTION AND FORTH HE STRODE A
PICTURE TO LOOK AT AND A PRESENCE TO ENFORCE ATTENTION
STALWART AND
PORTLY NOT A GRAY HAIR BROADBRIMMED SLOUCH HAT SEMI SAILOR TOGGERY OF
BLUE NAVY FLANNEL ROOMY AND AMPLE A STATELY EXPANSE OF SHIRT FRONT AND
A LIBERAL AMOUNT OF BLACK SILK NECK CLOTH TIED WITH A SAILOR KNOT LARGE
CHAIN AND IMPOSING SEALS IMPENDING FROM HIS FOB AWE INSPIRING FEET AND
A HAND LIKE THE HAND OF PROVIDENCE AS HIS WHALING BRETHREN EXPRESSED
IT WRIST BANDS AND SLEEVES PUSHED BACK HALF WAY TO THE ELBOW OUT OF
RESPECT FOR THE WARM WEATHER AND EXPOSING HAIRY ARMS GAUDY WITH RED AND
BLUE ANCHORS SHIPS AND GODDESSES OF LIBERTY TATTOOED IN INDIA INK
BUT THESE DETAILS WERE ONLY SECONDARY MATTERS HIS FACE WAS THE LODESTONE
THAT CHAINED THE EYE
IT WAS A SULTRY DISK GLOWING DETERMINEDLY OUT
THROUGH A WEATHER BEATEN MASK OF MAHOGANY AND STUDDED WITH WARTS SEAMED
WITH SCARS BLAZED ALL OVER WITH UNFAILING FRESH SLIPS OF THE RAZOR
AND WITH CHEERY EYES UNDER SHAGGY BROWS CONTEMPLATING THE WORLD FROM
OVER THE BACK OF A GNARLED CRAG OF A NOSE THAT LOOMED VAST AND LONELY OUT
OF THE UNDULATING IMMENSITY THAT SPREAD AWAY FROM ITS FOUNDATIONS
AT HIS HEELS FRISKED THE DARLING OF HIS BACHELOR ESTATE HIS TERRIER
FAN A CREATURE NO LARGER THAN A SQUIRREL
THE MAIN PART OF HIS DAILY
LIFE WAS OCCUPIED IN LOOKING AFTER FAN IN A MOTHERLY WAY AND
DOCTORING HER FOR A HUNDRED AILMENTS WHICH EXISTED ONLY IN HIS
IMAGINATION
THE ADMIRAL SELDOM READ NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN HE DID HE NEVER BELIEVED
ANYTHING THEY SAID
HE READ NOTHING AND BELIEVED IN NOTHING BUT THE
OLD GUARD A SECESSION PERIODICAL PUBLISHED IN NEW YORK
HE CARRIED A
DOZEN COPIES OF IT WITH HIM ALWAYS AND REFERRED TO THEM FOR ALL
REQUIRED INFORMATION
IF IT WAS NOT THERE HE SUPPLIED IT HIMSELF OUT
OF A BOUNTIFUL FANCY INVENTING HISTORY NAMES DATES AND EVERY THING
ELSE NECESSARY TO MAKE HIS POINT GOOD IN AN ARGUMENT
CONSEQUENTLY HE
WAS A FORMIDABLE ANTAGONIST IN A DISPUTE
WHENEVER HE SWUNG CLEAR OF THE
RECORD AND BEGAN TO CREATE HISTORY THE ENEMY WAS HELPLESS AND HAD TO
SURRENDER
INDEED THE ENEMY COULD NOT KEEP FROM BETRAYING SOME LITTLE
SPARK OF INDIGNATION AT HIS MANUFACTURED HISTORY AND WHEN IT CAME TO
INDIGNATION THAT WAS THE ADMIRAL'S VERY BEST HOLD HE WAS ALWAYS
READY FOR A POLITICAL ARGUMENT AND IF NOBODY STARTED ONE HE WOULD DO IT
HIMSELF
WITH HIS THIRD RETORT HIS TEMPER WOULD BEGIN TO RISE AND
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HE WOULD BE BLOWING A GALE AND WITHIN FIFTEEN HIS
SMOKING ROOM AUDIENCE WOULD BE UTTERLY STORMED AWAY AND THE OLD MAN LEFT
SOLITARY AND ALONE BANGING THE TABLE WITH HIS FIST KICKING THE CHAIRS
AND ROARING A HURRICANE OF PROFANITY
IT GOT SO AFTER A WHILE THAT
WHENEVER THE ADMIRAL APPROACHED WITH POLITICS IN HIS EYE THE PASSENGERS
WOULD DROP OUT WITH QUIET ACCORD AFRAID TO MEET HIM AND HE WOULD CAMP
ON A DESERTED FIELD
BUT HE FOUND HIS MATCH AT LAST AND BEFORE A FULL COMPANY
AT ONE TIME
OR ANOTHER EVERYBODY HAD ENTERED THE LISTS AGAINST HIM AND BEEN ROUTED
EXCEPT THE QUIET PASSENGER WILLIAMS
HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET AN
EXPRESSION OF OPINION OUT OF HIM ON POLITICS
BUT NOW JUST AS THE
ADMIRAL DREW NEAR THE DOOR AND THE COMPANY WERE ABOUT TO SLIP OUT
WILLIAMS SAID
ADMIRAL ARE YOU CERTAIN ABOUT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE CONCERNING THE
CLERGYMEN YOU MENTIONED THE OTHER DAY REFERRING TO A PIECE OF THE
ADMIRAL'S MANUFACTURED HISTORY
EVERY ONE WAS AMAZED AT THE MAN'S RASHNESS
THE IDEA OF DELIBERATELY
INVITING ANNIHILATION WAS A THING INCOMPREHENSIBLE
THE RETREAT CAME TO
A HALT THEN EVERYBODY SAT DOWN AGAIN WONDERING TO AWAIT THE UPSHOT OF
IT
THE ADMIRAL HIMSELF WAS AS SURPRISED AS ANY ONE
HE PAUSED IN THE
DOOR WITH HIS RED HANDKERCHIEF HALF RAISED TO HIS SWEATING FACE AND
CONTEMPLATED THE DARING REPTILE IN THE CORNER
CERTAIN OF IT AM I CERTAIN OF IT DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN LYING ABOUT
IT WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR ANYBODY THAT DON'T KNOW THAT CIRCUMSTANCE
DON'T KNOW ANYTHING A CHILD OUGHT TO KNOW IT
READ UP YOUR HISTORY
READ IT UP AND DON'T COME ASKING A MAN IF HE'S CERTAIN ABOUT A BIT
OF ABC STUFF THAT THE VERY SOUTHERN NIGGERS KNOW ALL ABOUT
HERE THE ADMIRAL'S FIRES BEGAN TO WAX HOT THE ATMOSPHERE THICKENED THE
COMING EARTHQUAKE RUMBLED HE BEGAN TO THUNDER AND LIGHTEN
WITHIN THREE
MINUTES HIS VOLCANO WAS IN FULL IRRUPTION AND HE WAS DISCHARGING FLAMES
AND ASHES OF INDIGNATION BELCHING BLACK VOLUMES OF FOUL HISTORY ALOFT
AND VOMITING RED HOT TORRENTS OF PROFANITY FROM HIS CRATER
MEANTIME
WILLIAMS SAT SILENT AND APPARENTLY DEEPLY AND EARNESTLY INTERESTED IN
WHAT THE OLD MAN WAS SAYING
BY AND BY WHEN THE LULL CAME HE SAID IN
THE MOST DEFERENTIAL WAY AND WITH THE GRATIFIED AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS HAD
A MYSTERY CLEARED UP WHICH HAD BEEN PUZZLING HIM UNCOMFORTABLY
NOW I UNDERSTAND IT
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I KNEW THAT PIECE OF HISTORY WELL
ENOUGH BUT WAS STILL AFRAID TO TRUST IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT THAT
CONVINCING PARTICULARITY ABOUT IT THAT ONE LIKES TO HAVE IN HISTORY BUT
WHEN YOU MENTIONED EVERY NAME THE OTHER DAY AND EVERY DATE AND EVERY
LITTLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THEIR JUST ORDER AND SEQUENCE I SAID TO MYSELF
THIS SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS HISTORY THIS IS PUTTING IT IN A
SHAPE THAT GIVES A MAN CONFIDENCE AND I SAID TO MYSELF AFTERWARD I WILL
JUST ASK THE ADMIRAL IF HE IS PERFECTLY CERTAIN ABOUT THE DETAILS AND IF
HE IS I WILL COME OUT AND THANK HIM FOR CLEARING THIS MATTER UP FOR ME
AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO DO NOW FOR UNTIL YOU SET THAT MATTER RIGHT IT
WAS NOTHING BUT JUST A CONFUSION IN MY MIND WITHOUT HEAD OR TAIL TO IT
NOBODY EVER SAW THE ADMIRAL LOOK SO MOLLIFIED BEFORE AND SO PLEASED
NOBODY HAD EVER RECEIVED HIS BOGUS HISTORY AS GOSPEL BEFORE ITS
GENUINENESS HAD ALWAYS BEEN CALLED IN QUESTION EITHER BY WORDS OR LOOKS
BUT HERE WAS A MAN THAT NOT ONLY SWALLOWED IT ALL DOWN BUT WAS GRATEFUL
FOR THE DOSE
HE WAS TAKEN A BACK HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY EVEN HIS
PROFANITY FAILED HIM
NOW WILLIAMS CONTINUED MODESTLY AND EARNESTLY
BUT ADMIRAL IN SAYING THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST STONE THROWN AND THAT
THIS PRECIPITATED THE WAR YOU HAVE OVERLOOKED A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH YOU
ARE PERFECTLY FAMILIAR WITH BUT WHICH HAS ESCAPED YOUR MEMORY
NOW I
GRANT YOU THAT WHAT YOU HAVE STATED IS CORRECT IN EVERY DETAIL TO WIT
THAT ON THE 16TH OF OCTOBER 1860 TWO MASSACHUSETTS CLERGYMEN NAMED
WAITE AND GRANGER WENT IN DISGUISE TO THE HOUSE OF JOHN MOODY IN
ROCKPORT AT DEAD OF NIGHT AND DRAGGED FORTH TWO SOUTHERN WOMEN AND
THEIR TWO LITTLE CHILDREN AND AFTER TARRING AND FEATHERING THEM CONVEYED
THEM TO BOSTON AND BURNED THEM ALIVE IN THE STATE HOUSE SQUARE AND I
ALSO GRANT YOUR PROPOSITION THAT THIS DEED IS WHAT LED TO THE SECESSION
OF SOUTH CAROLINA ON THE 20TH OF DECEMBER FOLLOWING
VERY WELL HERE
THE COMPANY WERE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO HEAR WILLIAMS PROCEED TO COME
BACK AT THE ADMIRAL WITH HIS OWN INVINCIBLE WEAPON CLEAN PURE
MANUFACTURED HISTORY WITHOUT A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT VERY WELL I SAY
BUT ADMIRAL WHY OVERLOOK THE WILLIS AND MORGAN CASE IN SOUTH CAROLINA
YOU ARE TOO WELL INFORMED A MAN NOT TO KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE
YOUR ARGUMENTS AND YOUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE SHOWN YOU TO BE INTIMATELY
CONVERSANT WITH EVERY DETAIL OF THIS NATIONAL QUARREL
YOU DEVELOP
MATTERS OF HISTORY EVERY DAY THAT SHOW PLAINLY THAT YOU ARE NO SMATTERER
IN IT CONTENT TO NIBBLE ABOUT THE SURFACE BUT A MAN WHO HAS SEARCHED
THE DEPTHS AND POSSESSED YOURSELF OF EVERYTHING THAT HAS A BEARING UPON
THE GREAT QUESTION
THEREFORE LET ME JUST RECALL TO YOUR MIND THAT
WILLIS AND MORGAN CASE THOUGH I SEE BY YOUR FACE THAT THE WHOLE THING IS
ALREADY PASSING THROUGH YOUR MEMORY AT THIS MOMENT
ON THE 12TH OF
AUGUST 1860 TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE WAITE AND GRANGER AFFAIR TWO SOUTH
CAROLINA CLERGYMEN NAMED JOHN H
MORGAN AND WINTHROP L
WILLIS ONE A
METHODIST AND THE OTHER AN OLD SCHOOL BAPTIST DISGUISED THEMSELVES AND
WENT AT MIDNIGHT TO THE HOUSE OF A PLANTER NAMED THOMPSON ARCHIBALD F
THOMPSON VICE PRESIDENT UNDER THOMAS JEFFERSON AND TOOK THENCE AT
MIDNIGHT HIS WIDOWED AUNT A NORTHERN WOMAN AND HER ADOPTED CHILD AN
ORPHAN NAMED MORTIMER HIGHIE AFFLICTED WITH EPILEPSY AND SUFFERING AT
THE TIME FROM WHITE SWELLING ON ONE OF HIS LEGS AND COMPELLED TO WALK ON
CRUTCHES IN CONSEQUENCE AND THE TWO MINISTERS IN SPITE OF THE PLEADINGS
OF THE VICTIMS DRAGGED THEM TO THE BUSH TARRED AND FEATHERED THEM AND
AFTERWARD BURNED THEM AT THE STAKE IN THE CITY OF CHARLESTON
YOU
REMEMBER PERFECTLY WELL WHAT A STIR IT MADE YOU REMEMBER PERFECTLY WELL
THAT EVEN THE CHARLESTON COURIER STIGMATIZED THE ACT AS BEING UNPLEASANT
OF QUESTIONABLE PROPRIETY AND SCARCELY JUSTIFIABLE AND LIKEWISE THAT IT
WOULD NOT BE MATTER OF SURPRISE IF RETALIATION ENSUED
AND YOU REMEMBER
ALSO THAT THIS THING WAS THE CAUSE OF THE MASSACHUSETTS OUTRAGE
WHO
INDEED WERE THE TWO MASSACHUSETTS MINISTERS AND WHO WERE THE TWO
SOUTHERN WOMEN THEY BURNED I DO NOT NEED TO REMIND YOU ADMIRAL WITH
YOUR INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY THAT WAITE WAS THE NEPHEW OF THE
WOMAN BURNED IN CHARLESTON THAT GRANGER WAS HER COUSIN IN THE SECOND
DEGREE AND THAT THE WOMAN THEY BURNED IN BOSTON WAS THE WIFE OF JOHN H
MORGAN AND THE STILL LOVED BUT DIVORCED WIFE OF WINTHROP L
WILLIS
NOW ADMIRAL IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT YOU SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FIRST
PROVOCATION CAME FROM THE SOUTHERN PREACHERS AND THAT THE NORTHERN ONES
WERE JUSTIFIED IN RETALIATING
IN YOUR ARGUMENTS YOU NEVER YET HAVE
SHOWN THE LEAST DISPOSITION TO WITHHOLD A JUST VERDICT OR BE IN ANYWISE
UNFAIR WHEN AUTHORITATIVE HISTORY CONDEMNED YOUR POSITION AND THEREFORE
I HAVE NO HESITATION IN ASKING YOU TO TAKE THE ORIGINAL BLAME FROM THE
MASSACHUSETTS MINISTERS IN THIS MATTER AND TRANSFER IT TO THE SOUTH
CAROLINA CLERGYMEN WHERE IT JUSTLY BELONGS
THE ADMIRAL WAS CONQUERED
THIS SWEET SPOKEN CREATURE WHO SWALLOWED HIS
FRAUDULENT HISTORY AS IF IT WERE THE BREAD OF LIFE BASKED IN HIS FURIOUS
BLASPHEMY AS IF IT WERE GENEROUS SUNSHINE FOUND ONLY CALM EVEN HANDED
JUSTICE IN HIS RAMPART PARTISANSHIP AND FLOODED HIM WITH INVENTED
HISTORY SO SUGARCOATED WITH FLATTERY AND DEFERENCE THAT THERE WAS NO
REJECTING IT WAS TOO MANY FOR HIM
HE STAMMERED SOME AWKWARD PROFANE
SENTENCES ABOUT THE WILLIS AND MORGAN BUSINESS HAVING ESCAPED HIS
MEMORY BUT THAT HE REMEMBERED IT NOW AND THEN UNDER PRETENCE OF
GIVING FAN SOME MEDICINE FOR AN IMAGINARY COUGH DREW OUT OF THE BATTLE
AND WENT AWAY A VANQUISHED MAN
THEN CHEERS AND LAUGHTER WENT UP AND
WILLIAMS THE SHIP'S BENEFACTOR WAS A HERO
THE NEWS WENT ABOUT THE
VESSEL CHAMPAGNE WAS ORDERED AND ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION INSTITUTED IN
THE SMOKING ROOM AND EVERYBODY FLOCKED THITHER TO SHAKE HANDS WITH THE
CONQUEROR
THE WHEELMAN SAID AFTERWARD THAT THE ADMIRAL STOOD UP BEHIND
THE PILOT HOUSE AND RIPPED AND CURSED ALL TO HIMSELF TILL HE LOOSENED
THE SMOKESTACK GUYS AND BECALMED THE MAINSAIL
THE ADMIRAL'S POWER WAS BROKEN
AFTER THAT IF HE BEGAN ARGUMENT
SOMEBODY WOULD BRING WILLIAMS AND THE OLD MAN WOULD GROW WEAK AND BEGIN
TO QUIET DOWN AT ONCE
AND AS SOON AS HE WAS DONE WILLIAMS IN HIS
DULCET INSINUATING WAY WOULD INVENT SOME HISTORY REFERRING FOR PROOF
TO THE OLD MAN'S OWN EXCELLENT MEMORY AND TO COPIES OF THE OLD GUARD
KNOWN NOT TO BE IN HIS POSSESSION THAT WOULD TURN THE TABLES COMPLETELY
AND LEAVE THE ADMIRAL ALL ABROAD AND HELPLESS
BY AND BY HE CAME TO SO
DREAD WILLIAMS AND HIS GILDED TONGUE THAT HE WOULD STOP TALKING WHEN HE
SAW HIM APPROACH AND FINALLY CEASED TO MENTION POLITICS ALTOGETHER AND
FROM THAT TIME FORWARD THERE WAS ENTIRE PEACE AND SERENITY IN THE SHIP
CHAPTER LXIII
ON A CERTAIN BRIGHT MORNING THE ISLANDS HOVE IN SIGHT LYING LOW ON THE
LONELY SEA AND EVERYBODY CLIMBED TO THE UPPER DECK TO LOOK
AFTER TWO
THOUSAND MILES OF WATERY SOLITUDE THE VISION WAS A WELCOME ONE
AS WE
APPROACHED THE IMPOSING PROMONTORY OF DIAMOND HEAD ROSE UP OUT OF THE
OCEAN ITS RUGGED FRONT SOFTENED BY THE HAZY DISTANCE AND PRESENTLY THE
DETAILS OF THE LAND BEGAN TO MAKE THEMSELVES MANIFEST FIRST THE LINE OF
BEACH THEN THE PLUMED COACOANUT TREES OF THE TROPICS THEN CABINS OF THE
NATIVES THEN THE WHITE TOWN OF HONOLULU SAID TO CONTAIN BETWEEN TWELVE
AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND INHABITANTS SPREAD OVER A DEAD LEVEL WITH STREETS
FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY FEET WIDE SOLID AND LEVEL AS A FLOOR MOST OF THEM
STRAIGHT AS A LINE AND FEW AS CROOKED AS A CORKSCREW
THE FURTHER I TRAVELED THROUGH THE TOWN THE BETTER I LIKED IT
EVERY STEP REVEALED A NEW CONTRAST DISCLOSED SOMETHING I WAS
UNACCUSTOMED TO
IN PLACE OF THE GRAND MUD COLORED BROWN FRONTS OF
SAN FRANCISCO I SAW DWELLINGS BUILT OF STRAW ADOBIES AND CREAM COLORED
PEBBLE AND SHELL CONGLOMERATED CORAL CUT INTO OBLONG BLOCKS AND LAID IN
CEMENT ALSO A GREAT NUMBER OF NEAT WHITE COTTAGES WITH GREEN
WINDOW SHUTTERS IN PLACE OF FRONT YARDS LIKE BILLIARD TABLES WITH IRON
FENCES AROUND THEM I SAW THESE HOMES SURROUNDED BY AMPLE YARDS THICKLY
CLAD WITH GREEN GRASS AND SHADED BY TALL TREES THROUGH WHOSE DENSE
FOLIAGE THE SUN COULD SCARCELY PENETRATE IN PLACE OF THE CUSTOMARY
GERANIUM CALLA LILY ETC LANGUISHING IN DUST AND GENERAL DEBILITY I
SAW LUXURIOUS BANKS AND THICKETS OF FLOWERS FRESH AS A MEADOW AFTER A
RAIN AND GLOWING WITH THE RICHEST DYES IN PLACE OF THE DINGY HORRORS OF
SAN FRANCISCO'S PLEASURE GROVE THE WILLOWS I SAW HUGE BODIED
WIDE SPREADING FOREST TREES WITH STRANGE NAMES AND STRANGER APPEARANCE
TREES THAT CAST A SHADOW LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND WERE ABLE TO STAND
ALONE WITHOUT BEING TIED TO GREEN POLES IN PLACE OF GOLD FISH WIGGLING
AROUND IN GLASS GLOBES ASSUMING COUNTLESS SHADES AND DEGREES OF
DISTORTION THROUGH THE MAGNIFYING AND DIMINISHING QUALITIES OF THEIR
TRANSPARENT PRISON HOUSES I SAW CATS TOM CATS MARY ANN CATS
LONG TAILED CATS BOB TAILED CATS BLIND CATS ONE EYED CATS WALL EYED
CATS CROSS EYED CATS GRAY CATS BLACK CATS WHITE CATS YELLOW CATS
STRIPED CATS SPOTTED CATS TAME CATS WILD CATS SINGED CATS INDIVIDUAL
CATS GROUPS OF CATS PLATOONS OF CATS COMPANIES OF CATS REGIMENTS OF
CATS ARMIES OF CATS MULTITUDES OF CATS MILLIONS OF CATS AND ALL OF
THEM SLEEK FAT LAZY AND SOUND ASLEEP
I LOOKED ON A MULTITUDE OF
PEOPLE SOME WHITE IN WHITE COATS VESTS PANTALOONS EVEN WHITE CLOTH
SHOES MADE SNOWY WITH CHALK DULY LAID ON EVERY MORNING BUT THE MAJORITY
OF THE PEOPLE WERE ALMOST AS DARK AS NEGROES WOMEN WITH COMELY FEATURES
FINE BLACK EYES ROUNDED FORMS INCLINING TO THE VOLUPTUOUS CLAD IN A
SINGLE BRIGHT RED OR WHITE GARMENT THAT FELL FREE AND UNCONFINED FROM
SHOULDER TO HEEL LONG BLACK HAIR FALLING LOOSE GYPSY HATS ENCIRCLED
WITH WREATHS OF NATURAL FLOWERS OF A BRILLIANT CARMINE TINT PLENTY OF
DARK MEN IN VARIOUS COSTUMES AND SOME WITH NOTHING ON BUT A BATTERED
STOVE PIPE HAT TILTED ON THE NOSE AND A VERY SCANT BREECH CLOUT
CERTAIN SMOKE DRIED CHILDREN WERE CLOTHED IN NOTHING BUT SUNSHINE
A VERY NEAT FITTING AND PICTURESQUE APPAREL INDEED
IN PLACE OF ROUGHS AND ROWDIES STARING AND BLACKGUARDING ON THE CORNERS
I SAW LONG HAIRED SADDLE COLORED SANDWICH ISLAND MAIDENS SITTING ON THE
GROUND IN THE SHADE OF CORNER HOUSES GAZING INDOLENTLY AT WHATEVER OR
WHOEVER HAPPENED ALONG INSTEAD OF WRETCHED COBBLE STONE PAVEMENTS I
WALKED ON A FIRM FOUNDATION OF CORAL BUILT UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
BY THE ABSURD BUT PERSEVERING INSECT OF THAT NAME WITH A LIGHT LAYER OF
LAVA AND CINDERS OVERLYING THE CORAL BELCHED UP OUT OF FATHOMLESS
PERDITION LONG AGO THROUGH THE SEARED AND BLACKENED CRATER THAT STANDS
DEAD AND HARMLESS IN THE DISTANCE NOW INSTEAD OF CRAMPED AND CROWDED
STREET CARS I MET DUSKY NATIVE WOMEN SWEEPING BY FREE AS THE WIND ON
FLEET HORSES AND ASTRIDE WITH GAUDY RIDING SASHES STREAMING LIKE
BANNERS BEHIND THEM INSTEAD OF THE COMBINED STENCHES OF CHINADOM AND
BRANNAN STREET SLAUGHTER HOUSES I BREATHED THE BALMY FRAGRANCE OF
JESSAMINE OLEANDER AND THE PRIDE OF INDIA IN PLACE OF THE HURRY AND
BUSTLE AND NOISY CONFUSION OF SAN FRANCISCO I MOVED IN THE MIDST OF A
SUMMER CALM AS TRANQUIL AS DAWN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN IN PLACE OF THE
GOLDEN CITY'S SKIRTING SAND HILLS AND THE PLACID BAY I SAW ON THE ONE
SIDE A FRAME WORK OF TALL PRECIPITOUS MOUNTAINS CLOSE AT HAND CLAD IN
REFRESHING GREEN AND CLEFT BY DEEP COOL CHASM LIKE VALLEYS AND IN
FRONT THE GRAND SWEEP OF THE OCEAN A BRILLIANT TRANSPARENT GREEN NEAR
THE SHORE BOUND AND BORDERED BY A LONG WHITE LINE OF FOAMY SPRAY DASHING
AGAINST THE REEF AND FURTHER OUT THE DEAD BLUE WATER OF THE DEEP SEA
FLECKED WITH WHITE CAPS AND IN THE FAR HORIZON A SINGLE LONELY SAIL
A MERE ACCENT MARK TO EMPHASIZE A SLUMBEROUS CALM AND A SOLITUDE THAT
WERE WITHOUT SOUND OR LIMIT
WHEN THE SUN SUNK DOWN THE ONE INTRUDER
FROM OTHER REALMS AND PERSISTENT IN SUGGESTIONS OF THEM IT WAS TRANCED
LUXURY TO SIT IN THE PERFUMED AIR AND FORGET THAT THERE WAS ANY WORLD BUT
THESE ENCHANTED ISLANDS
IT WAS SUCH ECSTACY TO DREAM AND DREAM TILL YOU GOT A BITE
A SCORPION BITE
THEN THE FIRST DUTY WAS TO GET UP OUT OF THE GRASS AND
KILL THE SCORPION AND THE NEXT TO BATHE THE BITTEN PLACE WITH ALCOHOL OR
BRANDY AND THE NEXT TO RESOLVE TO KEEP OUT OF THE GRASS IN FUTURE
THEN
CAME AN ADJOURNMENT TO THE BED CHAMBER AND THE PASTIME OF WRITING UP THE
DAY'S JOURNAL WITH ONE HAND AND THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSQUITOES WITH THE
OTHER A WHOLE COMMUNITY OF THEM AT A SLAP
THEN OBSERVING AN ENEMY
APPROACHING A HAIRY TARANTULA ON STILTS WHY NOT SET THE SPITTOON ON
HIM IT IS DONE AND THE PROJECTING ENDS OF HIS PAWS GIVE A LUMINOUS
IDEA OF THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS REACH
THEN TO BED AND BECOME A PROMENADE
FOR A CENTIPEDE WITH FORTY TWO LEGS ON A SIDE AND EVERY FOOT HOT ENOUGH
TO BURN A HOLE THROUGH A RAW HIDE
MORE SOAKING WITH ALCOHOL AND A
RESOLUTION TO EXAMINE THE BED BEFORE ENTERING IT IN FUTURE
THEN WAIT
AND SUFFER TILL ALL THE MOSQUITOES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE CRAWLED IN
UNDER THE BAR THEN SLIP OUT QUICKLY SHUT THEM IN AND SLEEP PEACEFULLY
ON THE FLOOR TILL MORNING
MEANTIME IT IS COMFORTING TO CURSE THE
TROPICS IN OCCASIONAL WAKEFUL INTERVALS
WE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF FRUIT IN HONOLULU OF COURSE
ORANGES
PINE APPLES BANANAS STRAWBERRIES LEMONS LIMES MANGOES GUAVAS
MELONS AND A RARE AND CURIOUS LUXURY CALLED THE CHIRIMOYA WHICH IS
DELICIOUSNESS ITSELF
THEN THERE IS THE TAMARIND
I THOUGHT TAMARINDS
WERE MADE TO EAT BUT THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT THE IDEA
I ATE SEVERAL AND
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THEY WERE RATHER SOUR THAT YEAR
THEY PURSED UP MY
LIPS TILL THEY RESEMBLED THE STEM END OF A TOMATO AND I HAD TO TAKE MY
SUSTENANCE THROUGH A QUILL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS
THEY SHARPENED MY TEETH TILL I COULD HAVE SHAVED WITH THEM AND GAVE THEM
A WIRE EDGE THAT I WAS AFRAID WOULD STAY BUT A CITIZEN SAID NO IT
WILL COME OFF WHEN THE ENAMEL DOES WHICH WAS COMFORTING AT ANY RATE
I FOUND AFTERWARD THAT ONLY STRANGERS EAT TAMARINDS BUT THEY ONLY EAT
THEM ONCE
CHAPTER LXIV
IN MY DIARY OF OUR THIRD DAY IN HONOLULU I FIND THIS
I AM PROBABLY THE MOST SENSITIVE MAN IN HAWAII TO NIGHT ESPECIALLY ABOUT
SITTING DOWN IN THE PRESENCE OF MY BETTERS
I HAVE RIDDEN FIFTEEN OR
TWENTY MILES ON HORSE BACK SINCE 5 P M
AND TO TELL THE HONEST TRUTH I
HAVE A DELICACY ABOUT SITTING DOWN AT ALL
AN EXCURSION TO DIAMOND HEAD AND THE KING'S COACOANUT GROVE WAS PLANNED
TO DAY TIME 4 30 P M THE PARTY TO CONSIST OF HALF A DOZEN GENTLEMEN
AND THREE LADIES
THEY ALL STARTED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR EXCEPT MYSELF
I WAS AT THE GOVERNMENT PRISON WITH CAPTAIN FISH AND ANOTHER
WHALESHIP SKIPPER CAPTAIN PHILLIPS AND GOT SO INTERESTED IN ITS
EXAMINATION THAT I DID NOT NOTICE HOW QUICKLY THE TIME WAS PASSING
SOMEBODY REMARKED THAT IT WAS TWENTY MINUTES PAST FIVE O'CLOCK AND THAT
WOKE ME UP
IT WAS A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT CAPTAIN PHILLIPS WAS
ALONG WITH HIS TURN OUT AS HE CALLS A TOP BUGGY THAT CAPTAIN COOK
BROUGHT HERE IN 1778 AND A HORSE THAT WAS HERE WHEN CAPTAIN COOK CAME
CAPTAIN PHILLIPS TAKES A JUST PRIDE IN HIS DRIVING AND IN THE SPEED OF
HIS HORSE AND TO HIS PASSION FOR DISPLAYING THEM I OWE IT THAT WE WERE
ONLY SIXTEEN MINUTES COMING FROM THE PRISON TO THE AMERICAN HOTEL A
DISTANCE WHICH HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE OVER HALF A MILE
BUT IT TOOK
SOME FEARFUL DRIVING
THE CAPTAIN'S WHIP CAME DOWN FAST AND THE BLOWS
STARTED SO MUCH DUST OUT OF THE HORSE'S HIDE THAT DURING THE LAST HALF OF
THE JOURNEY WE RODE THROUGH AN IMPENETRABLE FOG AND RAN BY A POCKET
COMPASS IN THE HANDS OF CAPTAIN FISH A WHALER OF TWENTY SIX YEARS
EXPERIENCE WHO SAT THERE THROUGH THE PERILOUS VOYAGE AS SELF POSSESSED
AS IF HE HAD BEEN ON THE EUCHRE DECK OF HIS OWN SHIP AND CALMLY SAID
PORT YOUR HELM PORT FROM TIME TO TIME AND HOLD HER A LITTLE FREE
STEADY SO SO AND LUFF HARD DOWN TO STARBOARD AND NEVER ONCE
LOST HIS PRESENCE OF MIND OR BETRAYED THE LEAST ANXIETY BY VOICE OR
MANNER
WHEN WE CAME TO ANCHOR AT LAST AND CAPTAIN PHILLIPS LOOKED AT
HIS WATCH AND SAID SIXTEEN MINUTES I TOLD YOU IT WAS IN HER THAT'S
OVER THREE MILES AN HOUR I COULD SEE HE FELT ENTITLED TO A COMPLIMENT
AND SO I SAID I HAD NEVER SEEN LIGHTNING GO LIKE THAT HORSE
AND I NEVER
HAD
THE LANDLORD OF THE AMERICAN SAID THE PARTY HAD BEEN GONE NEARLY AN HOUR
BUT THAT HE COULD GIVE ME MY CHOICE OF SEVERAL HORSES THAT COULD OVERTAKE
THEM
I SAID NEVER MIND I PREFERRED A SAFE HORSE TO A FAST ONE I
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN EXCESSIVELY GENTLE HORSE A HORSE WITH NO SPIRIT
WHATEVER A LAME ONE IF HE HAD SUCH A THING
INSIDE OF FIVE MINUTES I
WAS MOUNTED AND PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH MY OUTFIT
I HAD NO TIME TO
LABEL HIM THIS IS A HORSE AND SO IF THE PUBLIC TOOK HIM FOR A SHEEP I
CANNOT HELP IT
I WAS SATISFIED AND THAT WAS THE MAIN THING
I COULD
SEE THAT HE HAD AS MANY FINE POINTS AS ANY MAN'S HORSE AND SO I HUNG MY
HAT ON ONE OF THEM BEHIND THE SADDLE AND SWABBED THE PERSPIRATION FROM
MY FACE AND STARTED
I NAMED HIM AFTER THIS ISLAND OAHU PRONOUNCED
O WAW HEE
THE FIRST GATE HE CAME TO HE STARTED IN I HAD NEITHER WHIP
NOR SPUR AND SO I SIMPLY ARGUED THE CASE WITH HIM
HE RESISTED
ARGUMENT BUT ULTIMATELY YIELDED TO INSULT AND ABUSE
HE BACKED OUT OF
THAT GATE AND STEERED FOR ANOTHER ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET
I TRIUMPHED BY MY FORMER PROCESS
WITHIN THE NEXT SIX HUNDRED YARDS HE
CROSSED THE STREET FOURTEEN TIMES AND ATTEMPTED THIRTEEN GATES AND IN
THE MEANTIME THE TROPICAL SUN WAS BEATING DOWN AND THREATENING TO CAVE
THE TOP OF MY HEAD IN AND I WAS LITERALLY DRIPPING WITH PERSPIRATION
HE ABANDONED THE GATE BUSINESS AFTER THAT AND WENT ALONG PEACEABLY
ENOUGH BUT ABSORBED IN MEDITATION
I NOTICED THIS LATTER CIRCUMSTANCE
AND IT SOON BEGAN TO FILL ME WITH APPREHENSION
I SAID TO MY SELF THIS
CREATURE IS PLANNING SOME NEW OUTRAGE SOME FRESH DEVILTRY OR OTHER NO
HORSE EVER THOUGHT OVER A SUBJECT SO PROFOUNDLY AS THIS ONE IS DOING JUST
FOR NOTHING
THE MORE THIS THING PREYED UPON MY MIND THE MORE UNEASY I
BECAME UNTIL THE SUSPENSE BECAME ALMOST UNBEARABLE AND I DISMOUNTED TO
SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING WILD IN HIS EYE FOR I HAD HEARD THAT THE EYE
OF THIS NOBLEST OF OUR DOMESTIC ANIMALS IS VERY EXPRESSIVE
I CANNOT DESCRIBE WHAT A LOAD OF ANXIETY WAS LIFTED FROM MY MIND WHEN I
FOUND THAT HE WAS ONLY ASLEEP
I WOKE HIM UP AND STARTED HIM INTO A
FASTER WALK AND THEN THE VILLAINY OF HIS NATURE CAME OUT AGAIN
HE
TRIED TO CLIMB OVER A STONE WALL FIVE OR SIX FEET HIGH
I SAW THAT I
MUST APPLY FORCE TO THIS HORSE AND THAT I MIGHT AS WELL BEGIN FIRST AS
LAST
I PLUCKED A STOUT SWITCH FROM A TAMARIND TREE AND THE MOMENT HE
SAW IT HE SURRENDERED
HE BROKE INTO A CONVULSIVE SORT OF A CANTER
WHICH HAD THREE SHORT STEPS IN IT AND ONE LONG ONE AND REMINDED ME
ALTERNATELY OF THE CLATTERING SHAKE OF THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE AND THE
SWEEPING PLUNGING OF THE AJAX IN A STORM
AND NOW THERE CAN BE NO FITTER OCCASION THAN THE PRESENT TO PRONOUNCE A
LEFT HANDED BLESSING UPON THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE AMERICAN SADDLE
THERE IS NO SEAT TO SPEAK OF ABOUT IT ONE MIGHT AS WELL SIT IN A SHOVEL
AND THE STIRRUPS ARE NOTHING BUT AN ORNAMENTAL NUISANCE
IF I WERE TO
WRITE DOWN HERE ALL THE ABUSE I EXPENDED ON THOSE STIRRUPS IT WOULD MAKE
A LARGE BOOK EVEN WITHOUT PICTURES
SOMETIMES I GOT ONE FOOT SO FAR
THROUGH THAT THE STIRRUP PARTOOK OF THE NATURE OF AN ANKLET SOMETIMES
BOTH FEET WERE THROUGH AND I WAS HANDCUFFED BY THE LEGS AND SOMETIMES
MY FEET GOT CLEAR OUT AND LEFT THE STIRRUPS WILDLY DANGLING ABOUT MY
SHINS
EVEN WHEN I WAS IN PROPER POSITION AND CAREFULLY BALANCED UPON
THE BALLS OF MY FEET THERE WAS NO COMFORT IN IT ON ACCOUNT OF MY
NERVOUS DREAD THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SLIP ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IN A
MOMENT
BUT THE SUBJECT IS TOO EXASPERATING TO WRITE ABOUT
A MILE AND A HALF FROM TOWN I CAME TO A GROVE OF TALL COCOANUT TREES
WITH CLEAN BRANCHLESS STEMS REACHING STRAIGHT UP SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET
AND TOPPED WITH A SPRAY OF GREEN FOLIAGE SHELTERING CLUSTERS OF
COCOA NUTS NOT MORE PICTURESQUE THAN A FOREST OF COLLOSSAL RAGGED
PARASOLS WITH BUNCHES OF MAGNIFIED GRAPES UNDER THEM WOULD BE
I ONCE HEARD A GOUTY NORTHERN INVALID SAY THAT A COCOANUT TREE MIGHT BE
POETICAL POSSIBLY IT WAS BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A FEATHER DUSTER STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING
I THINK THAT DESCRIBES IT BETTER THAN A PICTURE AND YET
WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THERE IS SOMETHING FASCINATING ABOUT A COCOA NUT
TREE AND GRACEFUL TOO
ABOUT A DOZEN COTTAGES SOME FRAME AND THE OTHERS OF NATIVE GRASS
NESTLED SLEEPILY IN THE SHADE HERE AND THERE
THE GRASS CABINS ARE OF A
GRAYISH COLOR ARE SHAPED MUCH LIKE OUR OWN COTTAGES ONLY WITH HIGHER
AND STEEPER ROOFS USUALLY AND ARE MADE OF SOME KIND OF WEED STRONGLY
BOUND TOGETHER IN BUNDLES
THE ROOFS ARE VERY THICK AND SO ARE THE
WALLS THE LATTER HAVE SQUARE HOLES IN THEM FOR WINDOWS
AT A LITTLE
DISTANCE THESE CABINS HAVE A FURRY APPEARANCE AS IF THEY MIGHT BE MADE
OF BEAR SKINS
THEY ARE VERY COOL AND PLEASANT INSIDE
THE KING'S FLAG
WAS FLYING FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE COTTAGES AND HIS MAJESTY WAS
PROBABLY WITHIN
HE OWNS THE WHOLE CONCERN THEREABOUTS AND PASSES HIS
TIME THERE FREQUENTLY ON SULTRY DAYS LAYING OFF THE SPOT IS CALLED
THE KING'S GROVE
NEAR BY IS AN INTERESTING RUIN THE MEAGRE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT HEATHEN
TEMPLE A PLACE WHERE HUMAN SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED UP IN THOSE OLD
BYGONE DAYS WHEN THE SIMPLE CHILD OF NATURE YIELDING MOMENTARILY TO SIN
WHEN SORELY TEMPTED ACKNOWLEDGED HIS ERROR WHEN CALM REFLECTION HAD
SHOWN IT HIM AND CAME FORWARD WITH NOBLE FRANKNESS AND OFFERED UP HIS
GRANDMOTHER AS AN ATONING SACRIFICE IN THOSE OLD DAYS WHEN THE LUCKLESS
SINNER COULD KEEP ON CLEANSING HIS CONSCIENCE AND ACHIEVING PERIODICAL
HAPPINESS AS LONG AS HIS RELATIONS HELD OUT LONG LONG BEFORE THE
MISSIONARIES BRAVED A THOUSAND PRIVATIONS TO COME AND MAKE THEM
PERMANENTLY MISERABLE BY TELLING THEM HOW BEAUTIFUL AND HOW BLISSFUL A
PLACE HEAVEN IS AND HOW NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TO GET THERE AND SHOWED
THE POOR NATIVE HOW DREARY A PLACE PERDITION IS AND WHAT UNNECESSARILY
LIBERAL FACILITIES THERE ARE FOR GOING TO IT SHOWED HIM HOW IN HIS
IGNORANCE HE HAD GONE AND FOOLED AWAY ALL HIS KINFOLKS TO NO PURPOSE
SHOWED HIM WHAT RAPTURE IT IS TO WORK ALL DAY LONG FOR FIFTY CENTS TO BUY
FOOD FOR NEXT DAY WITH AS COMPARED WITH FISHING FOR PASTIME AND LOLLING
IN THE SHADE THROUGH ETERNAL SUMMER AND EATING OF THE BOUNTY THAT NOBODY
LABORED TO PROVIDE BUT NATURE
HOW SAD IT IS TO THINK OF THE MULTITUDES
WHO HAVE GONE TO THEIR GRAVES IN THIS BEAUTIFUL ISLAND AND NEVER KNEW
THERE WAS A HELL
THIS ANCIENT TEMPLE WAS BUILT OF ROUGH BLOCKS OF LAVA AND WAS SIMPLY A
ROOFLESS INCLOSURE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET LONG AND SEVENTY WIDE
NOTHING BUT NAKED WALLS VERY THICK BUT NOT MUCH HIGHER THAN A MAN'S
HEAD
THEY WILL LAST FOR AGES NO DOUBT IF LEFT UNMOLESTED
ITS THREE
ALTARS AND OTHER SACRED APPURTENANCES HAVE CRUMBLED AND PASSED AWAY YEARS
AGO
IT IS SAID THAT IN THE OLD TIMES THOUSANDS OF HUMAN BEINGS WERE
SLAUGHTERED HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF NAKED AND HOWLING SAVAGES
IF THESE
MUTE STONES COULD SPEAK WHAT TALES THEY COULD TELL WHAT PICTURES THEY
COULD DESCRIBE OF FETTERED VICTIMS WRITHING UNDER THE KNIFE OF MASSED
FORMS STRAINING FORWARD OUT OF THE GLOOM WITH FEROCIOUS FACES LIT UP BY
THE SACRIFICIAL FIRES OF THE BACKGROUND OF GHOSTLY TREES OF THE DARK
PYRAMID OF DIAMOND HEAD STANDING SENTINEL OVER THE UNCANNY SCENE AND THE
PEACEFUL MOON LOOKING DOWN UPON IT THROUGH RIFTS IN THE CLOUD RACK
WHEN KAMEHAMEHA PRONOUNCED KA MAY HA MAY AH THE GREAT WHO WAS A SORT
OF A NAPOLEON IN MILITARY GENIUS AND UNIFORM SUCCESS INVADED THIS ISLAND
OF OAHU THREE QUARTERS OF A CENTURY AGO AND EXTERMINATED THE ARMY SENT
TO OPPOSE HIM AND TOOK FULL AND FINAL POSSESSION OF THE COUNTRY HE
SEARCHED OUT THE DEAD BODY OF THE KING OF OAHU AND THOSE OF THE
PRINCIPAL CHIEFS AND IMPALED THEIR HEADS ON THE WALLS OF THIS TEMPLE
THOSE WERE SAVAGE TIMES WHEN THIS OLD SLAUGHTER HOUSE WAS IN ITS PRIME
THE KING AND THE CHIEFS RULED THE COMMON HERD WITH A ROD OF IRON MADE
THEM GATHER ALL THE PROVISIONS THE MASTERS NEEDED BUILD ALL THE HOUSES
AND TEMPLES STAND ALL THE EXPENSES OF WHATEVER KIND TAKE KICKS AND
CUFFS FOR THANKS DRAG OUT LIVES WELL FLAVORED WITH MISERY AND THEN
SUFFER DEATH FOR TRIFLING OFFENCES OR YIELD UP THEIR LIVES ON THE
SACRIFICIAL ALTARS TO PURCHASE FAVORS FROM THE GODS FOR THEIR HARD
RULERS
THE MISSIONARIES HAVE CLOTHED THEM EDUCATED THEM BROKEN UP THE
TYRANNOUS AUTHORITY OF THEIR CHIEFS AND GIVEN THEM FREEDOM AND THE RIGHT
TO ENJOY WHATEVER THEIR HANDS AND BRAINS PRODUCE WITH EQUAL LAWS FOR ALL
AND PUNISHMENT FOR ALL ALIKE WHO TRANSGRESS THEM
THE CONTRAST IS SO
STRONG THE BENEFIT CONFERRED UPON THIS PEOPLE BY THE MISSIONARIES IS SO
PROMINENT SO PALPABLE AND SO UNQUESTIONABLE THAT THE FRANKEST
COMPLIMENT I CAN PAY THEM AND THE BEST IS SIMPLY TO POINT TO THE
CONDITION OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDERS OF CAPTAIN COOK'S TIME AND THEIR
CONDITION TO DAY
THEIR WORK SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
CHAPTER LXV
BY AND BY AFTER A RUGGED CLIMB WE HALTED ON THE SUMMIT OF A HILL WHICH
COMMANDED A FAR REACHING VIEW
THE MOON ROSE AND FLOODED MOUNTAIN AND
VALLEY AND OCEAN WITH A MELLOW RADIANCE AND OUT OF THE SHADOWS OF THE
FOLIAGE THE DISTANT LIGHTS OF HONOLULU GLINTED LIKE AN ENCAMPMENT OF
FIREFLIES
THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH THE FRAGRANCE OF FLOWERS
THE HALT
WAS BRIEF GAYLY LAUGHING AND TALKING THE PARTY GALLOPED ON AND I
CLUNG TO THE POMMEL AND CANTERED AFTER
PRESENTLY WE CAME TO A PLACE
WHERE NO GRASS GREW A WIDE EXPANSE OF DEEP SAND
THEY SAID IT WAS AN
OLD BATTLE GROUND
ALL AROUND EVERYWHERE NOT THREE FEET APART THE
BLEACHED BONES OF MEN GLEAMED WHITE IN THE MOONLIGHT
WE PICKED UP A LOT
OF THEM FOR MEMENTOES
I GOT QUITE A NUMBER OF ARM BONES AND LEG BONES
OF GREAT CHIEFS MAY BE WHO HAD FOUGHT SAVAGELY IN THAT FEARFUL BATTLE
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN BLOOD FLOWED LIKE WINE WHERE WE NOW STOOD AND WORE
THE CHOICEST OF THEM OUT ON OAHU AFTERWARD TRYING TO MAKE HIM GO
ALL
SORTS OF BONES COULD BE FOUND EXCEPT SKULLS BUT A CITIZEN SAID
IRREVERENTLY THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF SKULL HUNTERS
THERE LATELY A SPECIES OF SPORTSMEN I HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE
NOTHING WHATEVER IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PLACE ITS STORY IS A SECRET THAT
WILL NEVER BE REVEALED
THE OLDEST NATIVES MAKE NO PRETENSE OF BEING
POSSESSED OF ITS HISTORY
THEY SAY THESE BONES WERE HERE WHEN THEY WERE
CHILDREN
THEY WERE HERE WHEN THEIR GRANDFATHERS WERE CHILDREN BUT HOW
THEY CAME HERE THEY CAN ONLY CONJECTURE
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THIS SPOT
TO BE AN ANCIENT BATTLE GROUND AND IT IS USUAL TO CALL IT SO AND THEY
BELIEVE THAT THESE SKELETONS HAVE LAIN FOR AGES JUST WHERE THEIR
PROPRIETORS FELL IN THE GREAT FIGHT
OTHER PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT
KAMEHAMEHA I
FOUGHT HIS FIRST BATTLE HERE
ON THIS POINT I HAVE HEARD
A STORY WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM ONE OF THE NUMEROUS BOOKS WHICH
HAVE BEEN WRITTEN CONCERNING THESE ISLANDS I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE
NARRATOR GOT IT
HE SAID THAT WHEN KAMEHAMEHA WHO WAS AT FIRST MERELY A
SUBORDINATE CHIEF ON THE ISLAND OF HAWAII LANDED HERE HE BROUGHT A
LARGE ARMY WITH HIM AND ENCAMPED AT WAIKIKI
THE OAHUANS MARCHED
AGAINST HIM AND SO CONFIDENT WERE THEY OF SUCCESS THAT THEY READILY
ACCEDED TO A DEMAND OF THEIR PRIESTS THAT THEY SHOULD DRAW A LINE WHERE
THESE BONES NOW LIE AND TAKE AN OATH THAT IF FORCED TO RETREAT AT ALL
THEY WOULD NEVER RETREAT BEYOND THIS BOUNDARY
THE PRIESTS TOLD THEM
THAT DEATH AND EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT WOULD OVERTAKE ANY WHO VIOLATED THE
OATH AND THE MARCH WAS RESUMED
KAMEHAMEHA DROVE THEM BACK STEP BY
STEP THE PRIESTS FOUGHT IN THE FRONT RANK AND EXHORTED THEM BOTH BY
VOICE AND INSPIRITING EXAMPLE TO REMEMBER THEIR OATH TO DIE IF NEED BE
BUT NEVER CROSS THE FATAL LINE
THE STRUGGLE WAS MANFULLY MAINTAINED
BUT AT LAST THE CHIEF PRIEST FELL PIERCED TO THE HEART WITH A SPEAR AND
THE UNLUCKY OMEN FELL LIKE A BLIGHT UPON THE BRAVE SOULS AT HIS BACK
WITH A TRIUMPHANT SHOUT THE INVADERS PRESSED FORWARD THE LINE WAS
CROSSED THE OFFENDED GODS DESERTED THE DESPAIRING ARMY AND ACCEPTING
THE DOOM THEIR PERJURY HAD BROUGHT UPON THEM THEY BROKE AND FLED OVER
THE PLAIN WHERE HONOLULU STANDS NOW UP THE BEAUTIFUL NUUANU VALLEY
PAUSED A MOMENT HEMMED IN BY PRECIPITOUS MOUNTAINS ON EITHER HAND AND
THE FRIGHTFUL PRECIPICE OF THE PARI IN FRONT AND THEN WERE DRIVEN OVER
A SHEER PLUNGE OF SIX HUNDRED FEET
THE STORY IS PRETTY ENOUGH BUT MR
JARVES' EXCELLENT HISTORY SAYS THE
OAHUANS WERE INTRENCHED IN NUUANU VALLEY THAT KAMEHAMEHA OUSTED THEM
ROUTED THEM PURSUED THEM UP THE VALLEY AND DROVE THEM OVER THE
PRECIPICE
HE MAKES NO MENTION OF OUR BONE YARD AT ALL IN HIS BOOK
IMPRESSED BY THE PROFOUND SILENCE AND REPOSE THAT RESTED OVER THE
BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE AND BEING AS USUAL IN THE REAR I GAVE VOICE TO MY
THOUGHTS
I SAID
WHAT A PICTURE IS HERE SLUMBERING IN THE SOLEMN GLORY OF THE MOON HOW
STRONG THE RUGGED OUTLINES OF THE DEAD VOLCANO STAND OUT AGAINST THE
CLEAR SKY WHAT A SNOWY FRINGE MARKS THE BURSTING OF THE SURF OVER THE
LONG CURVED REEF HOW CALMLY THE DIM CITY SLEEPS YONDER IN THE PLAIN
HOW SOFT THE SHADOWS LIE UPON THE STATELY MOUNTAINS THAT BORDER THE
DREAM HAUNTED MAUOA VALLEY WHAT A GRAND PYRAMID OF BILLOWY CLOUDS
TOWERS ABOVE THE STORIED PARI HOW THE GRIM WARRIORS OF THE PAST SEEM
FLOCKING IN GHOSTLY SQUADRONS TO THEIR ANCIENT BATTLEFIELD AGAIN HOW THE
WAILS OF THE DYING WELL UP FROM THE
AT THIS POINT THE HORSE CALLED OAHU SAT DOWN IN THE SAND
SAT DOWN TO
LISTEN I SUPPOSE
NEVER MIND WHAT HE HEARD I STOPPED APOSTROPHISING
AND CONVINCED HIM THAT I WAS NOT A MAN TO ALLOW CONTEMPT OF COURT ON THE
PART OF A HORSE
I BROKE THE BACK BONE OF A CHIEF OVER HIS RUMP AND SET
OUT TO JOIN THE CAVALCADE AGAIN
VERY CONSIDERABLY FAGGED OUT WE ARRIVED IN TOWN AT 9 O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
MYSELF IN THE LEAD FOR WHEN MY HORSE FINALLY CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE
WAS HOMEWARD BOUND AND HADN'T FAR TO GO HE TURNED HIS ATTENTION STRICTLY
TO BUSINESS
THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO DROP IN A PARAGRAPH OF INFORMATION
THERE IS NO
REGULAR LIVERY STABLE IN HONOLULU OR INDEED IN ANY PART OF THE KINGDOM
OF HAWAII THEREFORE UNLESS YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH WEALTHY RESIDENTS
WHO ALL HAVE GOOD HORSES YOU MUST HIRE ANIMALS OF THE WRETCHEDEST
DESCRIPTION FROM THE KANAKAS
I E
NATIVES ANY HORSE YOU HIRE EVEN
THOUGH IT BE FROM A WHITE MAN IS NOT OFTEN OF MUCH ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT
WILL BE BROUGHT IN FOR YOU FROM SOME RANCH AND HAS NECESSARILY BEEN
LEADING A HARD LIFE
IF THE KANAKAS WHO HAVE BEEN CARING FOR HIM
INVETERATE RIDERS THEY ARE HAVE NOT RIDDEN HIM HALF TO DEATH EVERY DAY
THEMSELVES YOU CAN DEPEND UPON IT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THE SAME THING BY
PROXY BY CLANDESTINELY HIRING HIM OUT
AT LEAST SO I AM INFORMED
THE
RESULT IS THAT NO HORSE HAS A CHANCE TO EAT DRINK REST RECUPERATE OR
LOOK WELL OR FEEL WELL AND SO STRANGERS GO ABOUT THE ISLANDS MOUNTED AS
I WAS TO DAY
IN HIRING A HORSE FROM A KANAKA YOU MUST HAVE ALL YOUR EYES ABOUT YOU
BECAUSE YOU CAN REST SATISFIED THAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH A SHREWD
UNPRINCIPLED RASCAL
YOU MAY LEAVE YOUR DOOR OPEN AND YOUR TRUNK
UNLOCKED AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE AND HE WILL NOT MEDDLE WITH YOUR
PROPERTY HE HAS NO IMPORTANT VICES AND NO INCLINATION TO COMMIT ROBBERY
ON A LARGE SCALE BUT IF HE CAN GET AHEAD OF YOU IN THE HORSE BUSINESS
HE WILL TAKE A GENUINE DELIGHT IN DOING IT
THIS TRAITS IS
CHARACTERISTIC OF HORSE JOCKEYS THE WORLD OVER IS IT NOT HE WILL
OVERCHARGE YOU IF HE CAN HE WILL HIRE YOU A FINE LOOKING HORSE AT NIGHT
ANYBODY'S MAY BE THE KING'S IF THE ROYAL STEED BE IN CONVENIENT VIEW
AND BRING YOU THE MATE TO MY OAHU IN THE MORNING AND CONTEND THAT IT IS
THE SAME ANIMAL
IF YOU MAKE TROUBLE HE WILL GET OUT BY SAYING IT WAS
NOT HIMSELF WHO MADE THE BARGAIN WITH YOU BUT HIS BROTHER WHO WENT OUT
IN THE COUNTRY THIS MORNING THEY HAVE ALWAYS GOT A BROTHER TO SHIFT
THE RESPONSIBILITY UPON
A VICTIM SAID TO ONE OF THESE FELLOWS ONE DAY
BUT I KNOW I HIRED THE HORSE OF YOU BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT SCAR ON YOUR
CHEEK
THE REPLY WAS NOT BAD OH YES YES MY BROTHER ALL SAME WE TWINS
A FRIEND OF MINE J
SMITH HIRED A HORSE YESTERDAY THE KANAKA
WARRANTING HIM TO BE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION
SMITH HAD A SADDLE AND BLANKET OF HIS OWN AND HE ORDERED THE KANAKA TO
PUT THESE ON THE HORSE
THE KANAKA PROTESTED THAT HE WAS PERFECTLY
WILLING TO TRUST THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE SADDLE THAT WAS ALREADY ON THE
ANIMAL BUT SMITH REFUSED TO USE IT
THE CHANGE WAS MADE THEN SMITH
NOTICED THAT THE KANAKA HAD ONLY CHANGED THE SADDLES AND HAD LEFT THE
ORIGINAL BLANKET ON THE HORSE HE SAID HE FORGOT TO CHANGE THE BLANKETS
AND SO TO CUT THE BOTHER SHORT SMITH MOUNTED AND RODE AWAY
THE HORSE
WENT LAME A MILE FROM TOWN AND AFTERWARD GOT TO CUTTING UP SOME
EXTRAORDINARY CAPERS
SMITH GOT DOWN AND TOOK OFF THE SADDLE BUT THE
BLANKET STUCK FAST TO THE HORSE GLUED TO A PROCESSION OF RAW PLACES
THE KANAKA'S MYSTERIOUS CONDUCT STOOD EXPLAINED
ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE BOUGHT A PRETTY GOOD HORSE FROM A NATIVE A DAY OR
TWO AGO AFTER A TOLERABLY THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE ANIMAL
HE
DISCOVERED TODAY THAT THE HORSE WAS AS BLIND AS A BAT IN ONE EYE
HE
MEANT TO HAVE EXAMINED THAT EYE AND CAME HOME WITH A GENERAL NOTION THAT
HE HAD DONE IT BUT HE REMEMBERS NOW THAT EVERY TIME HE MADE THE ATTEMPT
HIS ATTENTION WAS CALLED TO SOMETHING ELSE BY HIS VICTIMIZER
ONE MORE INSTANCE AND THEN I WILL PASS TO SOMETHING ELSE
I AM INFORMED
THAT WHEN A CERTAIN MR
L A VISITING STRANGER WAS HERE HE BOUGHT A
PAIR OF VERY RESPECTABLE LOOKING MATCH HORSES FROM A NATIVE
THEY WERE
IN A LITTLE STABLE WITH A PARTITION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF IT ONE HORSE
IN EACH APARTMENT
MR
L
EXAMINED ONE OF THEM CRITICALLY THROUGH A
WINDOW THE KANAKA'S BROTHER HAVING GONE TO THE COUNTRY WITH THE KEY
AND THEN WENT AROUND THE HOUSE AND EXAMINED THE OTHER THROUGH A WINDOW ON
THE OTHER SIDE
HE SAID IT WAS THE NEATEST MATCH HE HAD EVER SEEN AND
PAID FOR THE HORSES ON THE SPOT
WHEREUPON THE KANAKA DEPARTED TO JOIN
HIS BROTHER IN THE COUNTRY
THE FELLOW HAD SHAMEFULLY SWINDLED L
THERE
WAS ONLY ONE MATCH HORSE AND HE HAD EXAMINED HIS STARBOARD SIDE
THROUGH ONE WINDOW AND HIS PORT SIDE THROUGH ANOTHER I DECLINE TO
BELIEVE THIS STORY BUT I GIVE IT BECAUSE IT IS WORTH SOMETHING AS A
FANCIFUL ILLUSTRATION OF A FIXED FACT NAMELY THAT THE KANAKA
HORSE JOCKEY IS FERTILE IN INVENTION AND ELASTIC IN CONSCIENCE
YOU CAN BUY A PRETTY GOOD HORSE FOR FORTY OR FIFTY DOLLARS AND A GOOD
ENOUGH HORSE FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES FOR TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF
I
ESTIMATE OAHU TO BE WORTH SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY FIVE
CENTS
A GOOD DEAL BETTER ANIMAL THAN HE IS WAS SOLD HERE DAY BEFORE
YESTERDAY FOR A DOLLAR AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND SOLD AGAIN TO DAY FOR
TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS WILLIAMS BOUGHT A HANDSOME AND LIVELY
LITTLE PONY YESTERDAY FOR TEN DOLLARS AND ABOUT THE BEST COMMON HORSE ON
THE ISLAND AND HE IS A REALLY GOOD ONE SOLD YESTERDAY WITH MEXICAN
SADDLE AND BRIDLE FOR SEVENTY DOLLARS A HORSE WHICH IS WELL AND WIDELY
KNOWN AND GREATLY RESPECTED FOR HIS SPEED GOOD DISPOSITION AND
EVERLASTING BOTTOM
YOU GIVE YOUR HORSE A LITTLE GRAIN ONCE A DAY IT COMES FROM SAN
FRANCISCO AND IS WORTH ABOUT TWO CENTS A POUND AND YOU GIVE HIM AS MUCH
HAY AS HE WANTS IT IS CUT AND BROUGHT TO THE MARKET BY NATIVES AND IS
NOT VERY GOOD IT IS BALED INTO LONG ROUND BUNDLES ABOUT THE SIZE OF A
LARGE MAN ONE OF THEM IS STUCK BY THE MIDDLE ON EACH END OF A SIX FOOT
POLE AND THE KANAKA SHOULDERS THE POLE AND WALKS ABOUT THE STREETS
BETWEEN THE UPRIGHT BALES IN SEARCH OF CUSTOMERS
THESE HAY BALES THUS
CARRIED HAVE A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE TO A COLOSSAL CAPITAL 'H
THE HAY BUNDLES COST TWENTY FIVE CENTS APIECE AND ONE WILL LAST A HORSE
ABOUT A DAY
YOU CAN GET A HORSE FOR A SONG A WEEK'S HAY FOR ANOTHER
SONG AND YOU CAN TURN YOUR ANIMAL LOOSE AMONG THE LUXURIANT GRASS IN
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S BROAD FRONT YARD WITHOUT A SONG AT ALL YOU DO IT AT
MIDNIGHT AND STABLE THE BEAST AGAIN BEFORE MORNING
YOU HAVE BEEN AT NO
EXPENSE THUS FAR BUT WHEN YOU COME TO BUY A SADDLE AND BRIDLE THEY WILL
COST YOU FROM TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS
YOU CAN HIRE A HORSE
SADDLE AND BRIDLE AT FROM SEVEN TO TEN DOLLARS A WEEK AND THE OWNER WILL
TAKE CARE OF THEM AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
IT IS TIME TO CLOSE THIS DAY'S RECORD BED TIME
AS I PREPARE FOR SLEEP
A RICH VOICE RISES OUT OF THE STILL NIGHT AND FAR AS THIS OCEAN ROCK IS
TOWARD THE ENDS OF THE EARTH I RECOGNIZE A FAMILIAR HOME AIR
BUT THE
WORDS SEEM SOMEWHAT OUT OF JOINT
WAIKIKI LANTONI OE KAA HOOLY HOOLY WAWHOO
TRANSLATED THAT MEANS WHEN WE WERE MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA
CHAPTER LXVI
PASSING THROUGH THE MARKET PLACE WE SAW THAT FEATURE OF HONOLULU UNDER
ITS MOST FAVORABLE AUSPICES THAT IS IN THE FULL GLORY OF SATURDAY
AFTERNOON WHICH IS A FESTIVE DAY WITH THE NATIVES
THE NATIVE GIRLS BY
TWOS AND THREES AND PARTIES OF A DOZEN AND SOMETIMES IN WHOLE PLATOONS
AND COMPANIES WENT CANTERING UP AND DOWN THE NEIGHBORING STREETS ASTRIDE
OF FLEET BUT HOMELY HORSES AND WITH THEIR GAUDY RIDING HABITS STREAMING
LIKE BANNERS BEHIND THEM
SUCH A TROOP OF FREE AND EASY RIDERS IN THEIR
NATURAL HOME THE SADDLE MAKES A GAY AND GRACEFUL SPECTACLE
THE RIDING
HABIT I SPEAK OF IS SIMPLY A LONG BROAD SCARF LIKE A TAVERN TABLE CLOTH
BRILLIANTLY COLORED WRAPPED AROUND THE LOINS ONCE THEN APPARENTLY
PASSED BETWEEN THE LIMBS AND EACH END THROWN BACKWARD OVER THE SAME AND
FLOATING AND FLAPPING BEHIND ON BOTH SIDES BEYOND THE HORSE'S TAIL LIKE A
COUPLE OF FANCY FLAGS THEN SLIPPING THE STIRRUP IRONS BETWEEN HER TOES
THE GIRL THROWS HER CHEST FOR WARD SITS UP LIKE A MAJOR GENERAL AND GOES
SWEEPING BY LIKE THE WIND
THE GIRLS PUT ON ALL THE FINERY THEY CAN ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON FINE
BLACK SILK ROBES FLOWING RED ONES THAT NEARLY PUT YOUR EYES OUT OTHERS
AS WHITE AS SNOW STILL OTHERS THAT DISCOUNT THE RAINBOW AND THEY WEAR
THEIR HAIR IN NETS AND TRIM THEIR JAUNTY HATS WITH FRESH FLOWERS AND
ENCIRCLE THEIR DUSKY THROATS WITH HOME MADE NECKLACES OF THE BRILLIANT
VERMILLION TINTED BLOSSOM OF THE OHIA AND THEY FILL THE MARKETS AND THE
ADJACENT STREET WITH THEIR BRIGHT PRESENCES AND SMELL LIKE A RAG FACTORY
ON FIRE WITH THEIR OFFENSIVE COCOANUT OIL
OCCASIONALLY YOU SEE A HEATHEN FROM THE SUNNY ISLES AWAY DOWN IN THE
SOUTH SEAS WITH HIS FACE AND NECK TATOOED TILL HE LOOKS LIKE THE
CUSTOMARY MENDICANT FROM WASHOE WHO HAS BEEN BLOWN UP IN A MINE
SOME
ARE TATTOOED A DEAD BLUE COLOR DOWN TO THE UPPER LIP MASKED AS IT WERE
LEAVING THE NATURAL LIGHT YELLOW SKIN OF MICRONESIA UNSTAINED FROM
THENCE DOWN SOME WITH BROAD MARKS DRAWN DOWN FROM HAIR TO NECK ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE FACE AND A STRIP OF THE ORIGINAL YELLOW SKIN TWO INCHES
WIDE DOWN THE CENTER A GRIDIRON WITH A SPOKE BROKEN OUT AND SOME WITH
THE ENTIRE FACE DISCOLORED WITH THE POPULAR MORTIFICATION TINT RELIEVED
ONLY BY ONE OR TWO THIN WAVY THREADS OF NATURAL YELLOW RUNNING ACROSS
THE FACE FROM EAR TO EAR AND EYES TWINKLING OUT OF THIS DARKNESS FROM
UNDER SHADOWING HAT BRIMS LIKE STARS IN THE DARK OF THE MOON
MOVING AMONG THE STIRRING CROWDS YOU COME TO THE POI MERCHANTS
SQUATTING IN THE SHADE ON THEIR HAMS IN TRUE NATIVE FASHION AND
SURROUNDED BY PURCHASERS
THE SANDWICH ISLANDERS ALWAYS SQUAT ON THEIR
HAMS AND WHO KNOWS BUT THEY MAY BE THE OLD ORIGINAL HAM SANDWICHES
THE THOUGHT IS PREGNANT WITH INTEREST THE POI LOOKS LIKE COMMON FLOUR
PASTE AND IS KEPT IN LARGE BOWLS FORMED OF A SPECIES OF GOURD AND
CAPABLE OF HOLDING FROM ONE TO THREE OR FOUR GALLONS
POI IS THE CHIEF
ARTICLE OF FOOD AMONG THE NATIVES AND IS PREPARED FROM THE TARO PLANT
THE TARO ROOT LOOKS LIKE A THICK OR IF YOU PLEASE A CORPULENT SWEET
POTATO IN SHAPE BUT IS OF A LIGHT PURPLE COLOR WHEN BOILED
WHEN
BOILED IT ANSWERS AS A PASSABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR BREAD
THE BUCK KANAKAS
BAKE IT UNDER GROUND THEN MASH IT UP WELL WITH A HEAVY LAVA PESTLE MIX
WATER WITH IT UNTIL IT BECOMES A PASTE SET IT ASIDE AND LET IF FERMENT
AND THEN IT IS POI AND AN UNSEDUCTIVE MIXTURE IT IS ALMOST TASTELESS
BEFORE IT FERMENTS AND TOO SOUR FOR A LUXURY AFTERWARD
BUT NOTHING IS
MORE NUTRITIOUS
WHEN SOLELY USED HOWEVER IT PRODUCES ACRID HUMORS A
FACT WHICH SUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE HUMOROUS CHARACTER OF THE
KANAKAS
I THINK THERE MUST BE AS MUCH OF A KNACK IN HANDLING POI AS
THERE IS IN EATING WITH CHOPSTICKS
THE FOREFINGER IS THRUST INTO THE
MESS AND STIRRED QUICKLY ROUND SEVERAL TIMES AND DRAWN AS QUICKLY OUT
THICKLY COATED JUST AS IT IT WERE POULTICED THE HEAD IS THROWN BACK
THE FINGER INSERTED IN THE MOUTH AND THE DELICACY STRIPPED OFF AND
SWALLOWED THE EYE CLOSING GENTLY MEANWHILE IN A LANGUID SORT OF
ECSTASY
MANY A DIFFERENT FINGER GOES INTO THE SAME BOWL AND MANY A
DIFFERENT KIND OF DIRT AND SHADE AND QUALITY OF FLAVOR IS ADDED TO THE
VIRTUES OF ITS CONTENTS
AROUND A SMALL SHANTY WAS COLLECTED A CROWD OF NATIVES BUYING THE AWA
ROOT
IT IS SAID THAT BUT FOR THE USE OF THIS ROOT THE DESTRUCTION OF
THE PEOPLE IN FORMER TIMES BY CERTAIN IMPORTED DISEASES WOULD HAVE BEEN
FAR GREATER THAN IT WAS AND BY OTHERS IT IS SAID THAT THIS IS MERELY A
FANCY
ALL AGREE THAT POI WILL REJUVENATE A MAN WHO IS USED UP AND HIS
VITALITY ALMOST ANNIHILATED BY HARD DRINKING AND THAT IN SOME KINDS OF
DISEASES IT WILL RESTORE HEALTH AFTER ALL MEDICINES HAVE FAILED BUT ALL
ARE NOT WILLING TO ALLOW TO THE AWA THE VIRTUES CLAIMED FOR IT
THE
NATIVES MANUFACTURE AN INTOXICATING DRINK FROM IT WHICH IS FEARFUL IN ITS
EFFECTS WHEN PERSISTENTLY INDULGED IN
IT COVERS THE BODY WITH DRY
WHITE SCALES INFLAMES THE EYES AND CAUSES PREMATURE DECRIPITUDE
ALTHOUGH THE MAN BEFORE WHOSE ESTABLISHMENT WE STOPPED HAS TO PAY A
GOVERNMENT LICENSE OF EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE EXCLUSIVE
RIGHT TO SELL AWA ROOT IT IS SAID THAT HE MAKES A SMALL FORTUNE EVERY
TWELVE MONTH WHILE SALOON KEEPERS WHO PAY A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR
THE PRIVILEGE OF RETAILING WHISKEY ETC ONLY MAKE A BARE LIVING
WE FOUND THE FISH MARKET CROWDED FOR THE NATIVE IS VERY FOND OF FISH
AND EATS THE ARTICLE RAW AND ALIVE LET US CHANGE THE SUBJECT
IN OLD TIMES HERE SATURDAY WAS A GRAND GALA DAY INDEED
ALL THE NATIVE
POPULATION OF THE TOWN FORSOOK THEIR LABORS AND THOSE OF THE SURROUNDING
COUNTRY JOURNEYED TO THE CITY
THEN THE WHITE FOLKS HAD TO STAY INDOORS
FOR EVERY STREET WAS SO PACKED WITH CHARGING CAVALIERS AND CAVALIERESSES
THAT IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO THREAD ONE'S WAY THROUGH THE CAVALCADES
WITHOUT GETTING CRIPPLED
AT NIGHT THEY FEASTED AND THE GIRLS DANCED THE LASCIVIOUS HULA HULA A
DANCE THAT IS SAID TO EXHIBIT THE VERY PERFECTION OF EDUCATED NOTION OF
LIMB AND ARM HAND HEAD AND BODY AND THE EXACTEST UNIFORMITY OF
MOVEMENT AND ACCURACY OF TIME IT WAS PERFORMED BY A CIRCLE OF GIRLS
WITH NO RAIMENT ON THEM TO SPEAK OF WHO WENT THROUGH AN INFINITE VARIETY
OF MOTIONS AND FIGURES WITHOUT PROMPTING AND YET SO TRUE WAS THEIR
TIME AND IN SUCH PERFECT CONCERT DID THEY MOVE THAT WHEN THEY WERE
PLACED IN A STRAIGHT LINE HANDS ARMS BODIES LIMBS AND HEADS WAVED
SWAYED GESTICULATED BOWED STOOPED WHIRLED SQUIRMED TWISTED AND
UNDULATED AS IF THEY WERE PART AND PARCEL OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL AND IT
WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THEY WERE NOT MOVED IN A BODY BY SOME EXQUISITE
PIECE OF MECHANISM
OF LATE YEARS HOWEVER SATURDAY HAS LOST MOST OF ITS QUONDAM GALA
FEATURES
THIS WEEKLY STAMPEDE OF THE NATIVES INTERFERED TOO MUCH WITH
LABOR AND THE INTERESTS OF THE WHITE FOLKS AND BY STICKING IN A LAW
HERE AND PREACHING A SERMON THERE AND BY VARIOUS OTHER MEANS THEY
GRADUALLY BROKE IT UP
THE DEMORALIZING HULA HULA WAS FORBIDDEN TO BE
PERFORMED SAVE AT NIGHT WITH CLOSED DOORS IN PRESENCE OF FEW
SPECTATORS AND ONLY BY PERMISSION DULY PROCURED FROM THE AUTHORITIES AND
THE PAYMENT OF TEN DOLLARS FOR THE SAME
THERE ARE FEW GIRLS NOW A DAYS
ABLE TO DANCE THIS ANCIENT NATIONAL DANCE IN THE HIGHEST PERFECTION OF
THE ART
THE MISSIONARIES HAVE CHRISTIANIZED AND EDUCATED ALL THE NATIVES
THEY
ALL BELONG TO THE CHURCH AND THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM ABOVE THE AGE OF
EIGHT YEARS BUT CAN READ AND WRITE WITH FACILITY IN THE NATIVE TONGUE
IT IS THE MOST UNIVERSALLY EDUCATED RACE OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF CHINA
THEY HAVE ANY QUANTITY OF BOOKS PRINTED IN THE KANAKA LANGUAGE AND ALL
THE NATIVES ARE FOND OF READING
THEY ARE INVETERATE CHURCH GOERS
NOTHING CAN KEEP THEM AWAY
ALL THIS AMELIORATING CULTIVATION HAS AT
LAST BUILT UP IN THE NATIVE WOMEN A PROFOUND RESPECT FOR CHASTITY IN
OTHER PEOPLE
PERHAPS THAT IS ENOUGH TO SAY ON THAT HEAD
THE NATIONAL
SIN WILL DIE OUT WHEN THE RACE DOES BUT PERHAPS NOT EARLIER BUT
DOUBTLESS THIS PURIFYING IS NOT FAR OFF WHEN WE REFLECT THAT CONTACT
WITH CIVILIZATION AND THE WHITES HAS REDUCED THE NATIVE POPULATION FROM
FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CAPTAIN COOK'S ESTIMATE TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND
IN SOMETHING OVER EIGHTY YEARS
SOCIETY IS A QUEER MEDLEY IN THIS NOTABLE MISSIONARY WHALING AND
GOVERNMENTAL CENTRE
IF YOU GET INTO CONVERSATION WITH A STRANGER AND
EXPERIENCE THAT NATURAL DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF GROUND YOU ARE
TREADING ON BY FINDING OUT WHAT MANNER OF MAN YOUR STRANGER IS STRIKE
OUT BOLDLY AND ADDRESS HIM AS CAPTAIN WATCH HIM NARROWLY AND IF YOU
SEE BY HIS COUNTENANCE THAT YOU ARE ON THE WRONG TACK ASK HIM WHERE HE
PREACHES
IT IS A SAFE BET THAT HE IS EITHER A MISSIONARY OR CAPTAIN OF
A WHALER
I AM NOW PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH SEVENTY TWO CAPTAINS AND
NINETY SIX MISSIONARIES
THE CAPTAINS AND MINISTERS FORM ONE HALF OF THE
POPULATION THE THIRD FOURTH IS COMPOSED OF COMMON KANAKAS AND MERCANTILE
FOREIGNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THE FINAL FOURTH IS MADE UP OF HIGH
OFFICERS OF THE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT
AND THERE ARE JUST ABOUT CATS
ENOUGH FOR THREE APIECE ALL AROUND
A SOLEMN STRANGER MET ME IN THE SUBURBS THE OTHER DAY AND SAID
GOOD MORNING YOUR REVERENCE
PREACH IN THE STONE CHURCH YONDER NO
DOUBT
NO I DON'T
I'M NOT A PREACHER
REALLY I BEG YOUR PARDON CAPTAIN
I TRUST YOU HAD A GOOD SEASON

I'M ONLY A PRIVATE PERSONAGE AN UNASSUMING STRANGER LATELY ARRIVED
FROM AMERICA
NO NOT A MISSIONARY NOT A WHALER NOT A MEMBER OF HIS MAJESTY'S
GOVERNMENT NOT EVEN SECRETARY OF THE NAVY AH HEAVEN IT IS TOO
BLISSFUL TO BE TRUE ALAS I DO BUT DREAM
AND YET THAT NOBLE HONEST
COUNTENANCE THOSE OBLIQUE INGENUOUS EYES THAT MASSIVE HEAD INCAPABLE
OF OF ANYTHING YOUR HAND GIVE ME YOUR HAND BRIGHT WAIF
EXCUSE
THESE TEARS
FOR SIXTEEN WEARY YEARS I HAVE YEARNED FOR A MOMENT LIKE
THIS AND
HERE HIS FEELINGS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE SWOONED AWAY
I PITIED
THIS POOR CREATURE FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART
I WAS DEEPLY MOVED
I
SHED A FEW TEARS ON HIM AND KISSED HIM FOR HIS MOTHER
I THEN TOOK WHAT
SMALL CHANGE HE HAD AND SHOVED
CHAPTER LXVII
I STILL QUOTE FROM MY JOURNAL
I FOUND THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE TO CONSIST OF HALF A DOZEN WHITE MEN AND
SOME THIRTY OR FORTY NATIVES
IT WAS A DARK ASSEMBLAGE
THE NOBLES AND
MINISTERS ABOUT A DOZEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER OCCUPIED THE EXTREME LEFT OF
THE HALL WITH DAVID KALAKAUA THE KING'S CHAMBERLAIN AND PRINCE WILLIAM
AT THE HEAD
THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSEMBLY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS M
KEKUANAOA KEKUANAOA IS NOT OF THE BLOOD ROYAL
HE DERIVES HIS PRINCELY
RANK FROM HIS WIFE WHO WAS A DAUGHTER OF KAMEHAMEHA THE GREAT
UNDER
OTHER MONARCHIES THE MALE LINE TAKES PRECEDENCE OF THE FEMALE IN TRACING
GENEALOGIES BUT HERE THE OPPOSITE IS THE CASE THE FEMALE LINE TAKES
PRECEDENCE
THEIR REASON FOR THIS IS EXCEEDINGLY SENSIBLE AND I
RECOMMEND IT TO THE ARISTOCRACY OF EUROPE THEY SAY IT IS EASY TO KNOW
WHO A MAN'S MOTHER WAS BUT ETC ETC AND THE VICE PRESIDENT THE
LATTER A WHITE MAN SAT IN THE PULPIT IF I MAY SO TERM IT
THE PRESIDENT IS THE KING'S FATHER
HE IS AN ERECT STRONGLY BUILT
MASSIVE FEATURED WHITE HAIRED TAWNY OLD GENTLEMAN OF EIGHTY YEARS OF
AGE OR THEREABOUTS
HE WAS SIMPLY BUT WELL DRESSED IN A BLUE CLOTH COAT
AND WHITE VEST AND WHITE PANTALOONS WITHOUT SPOT DUST OR BLEMISH UPON
THEM
HE BEARS HIMSELF WITH A CALM STATELY DIGNITY AND IS A MAN OF
NOBLE PRESENCE
HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND A DISTINGUISHED WARRIOR UNDER
THAT TERRIFIC FIGHTER KAMEHAMEHA I MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY AGO
A
KNOWLEDGE OF HIS CAREER SUGGESTED SOME SUCH THOUGHT AS THIS THIS MAN
NAKED AS THE DAY HE WAS BORN AND WAR CLUB AND SPEAR IN HAND HAS CHARGED
AT THE HEAD OF A HORDE OF SAVAGES AGAINST OTHER HORDES OF SAVAGES MORE
THAN A GENERATION AND A HALF AGO AND REVELED IN SLAUGHTER AND CARNAGE
HAS WORSHIPPED WOODEN IMAGES ON HIS DEVOUT KNEES HAS SEEN HUNDREDS OF
HIS RACE OFFERED UP IN HEATHEN TEMPLES AS SACRIFICES TO WOODEN IDOLS AT
A TIME WHEN NO MISSIONARY'S FOOT HAD EVER PRESSED THIS SOIL AND HE HAD
NEVER HEARD OF THE WHITE MAN'S GOD HAS BELIEVED HIS ENEMY COULD SECRETLY
PRAY HIM TO DEATH HAS SEEN THE DAY IN HIS CHILDHOOD WHEN IT WAS A
CRIME PUNISHABLE BY DEATH FOR A MAN TO EAT WITH HIS WIFE OR FOR A
PLEBEIAN TO LET HIS SHADOW FALL UPON THE KING AND NOW LOOK AT HIM AN
EDUCATED CHRISTIAN NEATLY AND HANDSOMELY DRESSED A HIGH MINDED ELEGANT
GENTLEMAN A TRAVELER IN SOME DEGREE AND ONE WHO HAS BEEN THE HONORED
GUEST OF ROYALTY IN EUROPE A MAN PRACTICED IN HOLDING THE REINS OF AN
ENLIGHTENED GOVERNMENT AND WELL VERSED IN THE POLITICS OF HIS COUNTRY
AND IN GENERAL PRACTICAL INFORMATION
LOOK AT HIM SITTING THERE
PRESIDING OVER THE DELIBERATIONS OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY AMONG WHOM ARE
WHITE MEN A GRAVE DIGNIFIED STATESMANLIKE PERSONAGE AND AS SEEMINGLY
NATURAL AND FITTED TO THE PLACE AS IF HE HAD BEEN BORN IN IT AND HAD
NEVER BEEN OUT OF IT IN HIS LIFE TIME
HOW THE EXPERIENCES OF THIS OLD
MAN'S EVENTFUL LIFE SHAME THE CHEAP INVENTIONS OF ROMANCE
THE CHRISTIANIZING OF THE NATIVES HAS HARDLY EVEN WEAKENED SOME OF THEIR
BARBARIAN SUPERSTITIONS MUCH LESS DESTROYED THEM
I HAVE JUST REFERRED
TO ONE OF THESE
IT IS STILL A POPULAR BELIEF THAT IF YOUR ENEMY CAN GET
HOLD OF ANY ARTICLE BELONGING TO YOU HE CAN GET DOWN ON HIS KNEES OVER IT
AND PRAY YOU TO DEATH
THEREFORE MANY A NATIVE GIVES UP AND DIES MERELY
BECAUSE HE IMAGINES THAT SOME ENEMY IS PUTTING HIM THROUGH A COURSE OF
DAMAGING PRAYER
THIS PRAYING AN INDIVIDUAL TO DEATH SEEMS ABSURD ENOUGH
AT A FIRST GLANCE BUT THEN WHEN WE CALL TO MIND SOME OF THE PULPIT
EFFORTS OF CERTAIN OF OUR OWN MINISTERS THE THING LOOKS PLAUSIBLE
IN FORMER TIMES AMONG THE ISLANDERS NOT ONLY A PLURALITY OF WIVES WAS
CUSTOMARY BUT A PLURALITY OF HUSBANDS LIKEWISE
SOME NATIVE WOMEN OF
NOBLE RANK HAD AS MANY AS SIX HUSBANDS
A WOMAN THUS SUPPLIED DID NOT
RESIDE WITH ALL HER HUSBANDS AT ONCE BUT LIVED SEVERAL MONTHS WITH EACH
IN TURN
AN UNDERSTOOD SIGN HUNG AT HER DOOR DURING THESE MONTHS
WHEN
THE SIGN WAS TAKEN DOWN IT MEANT NEXT
IN THOSE DAYS WOMAN WAS RIGIDLY TAUGHT TO KNOW HER PLACE HER PLACE
WAS TO DO ALL THE WORK TAKE ALL THE CUFFS PROVIDE ALL THE FOOD AND
CONTENT HERSELF WITH WHAT WAS LEFT AFTER HER LORD HAD FINISHED HIS
DINNER
SHE WAS NOT ONLY FORBIDDEN BY ANCIENT LAW AND UNDER PENALTY OF
DEATH TO EAT WITH HER HUSBAND OR ENTER A CANOE BUT WAS DEBARRED UNDER
THE SAME PENALTY FROM EATING BANANAS PINE APPLES ORANGES AND OTHER
CHOICE FRUITS AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY PLACE
SHE HAD TO CONFINE HERSELF
PRETTY STRICTLY TO POI AND HARD WORK
THESE POOR IGNORANT HEATHEN SEEM
TO HAVE HAD A SORT OF GROPING IDEA OF WHAT CAME OF WOMAN EATING FRUIT IN
THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND THEY DID NOT CHOOSE TO TAKE ANY MORE CHANCES
BUT THE MISSIONARIES BROKE UP THIS SATISFACTORY ARRANGEMENT OF THINGS
THEY LIBERATED WOMAN AND MADE HER THE EQUAL OF MAN
THE NATIVES HAD A ROMANTIC FASHION OF BURYING SOME OF THEIR CHILDREN
ALIVE WHEN THE FAMILY BECAME LARGER THAN NECESSARY
THE MISSIONARIES
INTERFERED IN THIS MATTER TOO AND STOPPED IT
TO THIS DAY THE NATIVES ARE ABLE TO LIE DOWN AND DIE WHENEVER THEY WANT
TO WHETHER THERE IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH THEM OR NOT
IF A KANAKA
TAKES A NOTION TO DIE THAT IS THE END OF HIM NOBODY CAN PERSUADE HIM TO
HOLD ON ALL THE DOCTORS IN THE WORLD COULD NOT SAVE HIM
A LUXURY WHICH THEY ENJOY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS A LARGE FUNERAL
IF A PERSON WANTS TO GET RID OF A TROUBLESOME NATIVE IT IS ONLY
NECESSARY TO PROMISE HIM A FINE FUNERAL AND NAME THE HOUR AND HE WILL BE
ON HAND TO THE MINUTE AT LEAST HIS REMAINS WILL
ALL THE NATIVES ARE CHRISTIANS NOW BUT MANY OF THEM STILL DESERT TO THE
GREAT SHARK GOD FOR TEMPORARY SUCCOR IN TIME OF TROUBLE
AN IRRUPTION OF
THE GREAT VOLCANO OF KILAUEA OR AN EARTHQUAKE ALWAYS BRINGS A DEAL OF
LATENT LOYALTY TO THE GREAT SHARK GOD TO THE SURFACE
IT IS COMMON
REPORT THAT THE KING EDUCATED CULTIVATED AND REFINED CHRISTIAN
GENTLEMAN AS HE UNDOUBTEDLY IS STILL TURNS TO THE IDOLS OF HIS FATHERS
FOR HELP WHEN DISASTER THREATENS
A PLANTER CAUGHT A SHARK AND ONE OF
HIS CHRISTIANIZED NATIVES TESTIFIED HIS EMANCIPATION FROM THE THRALL OF
ANCIENT SUPERSTITION BY ASSISTING TO DISSECT THE SHARK AFTER A FASHION
FORBIDDEN BY HIS ABANDONED CREED
BUT REMORSE SHORTLY BEGAN TO TORTURE
HIM
HE GREW MOODY AND SOUGHT SOLITUDE BROODED OVER HIS SIN REFUSED
FOOD AND FINALLY SAID HE MUST DIE AND OUGHT TO DIE FOR HE HAD SINNED
AGAINST THE GREAT SHARK GOD AND COULD NEVER KNOW PEACE ANY MORE
HE WAS
PROOF AGAINST PERSUASION AND RIDICULE AND IN THE COURSE OF A DAY OR TWO
TOOK TO HIS BED AND DIED ALTHOUGH HE SHOWED NO SYMPTOM OF DISEASE
HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER FOLLOWED HIS LEAD AND SUFFERED A LIKE FATE WITHIN THE
WEEK
SUPERSTITION IS INGRAINED IN THE NATIVE BLOOD AND BONE AND IT IS
ONLY NATURAL THAT IT SHOULD CROP OUT IN TIME OF DISTRESS
WHEREVER ONE
GOES IN THE ISLANDS HE WILL FIND SMALL PILES OF STONES BY THE WAYSIDE
COVERED WITH LEAFY OFFERINGS PLACED THERE BY THE NATIVES TO APPEASE EVIL
SPIRITS OR HONOR LOCAL DEITIES BELONGING TO THE MYTHOLOGY OF FORMER DAYS
IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS OF ANY OF THE ISLANDS THE TRAVELER HOURLY COMES
UPON PARTIES OF DUSKY MAIDENS BATHING IN THE STREAMS OR IN THE SEA
WITHOUT ANY CLOTHING ON AND EXHIBITING NO VERY INTEMPERATE ZEAL IN THE
MATTER OF HIDING THEIR NAKEDNESS
WHEN THE MISSIONARIES FIRST TOOK UP
THEIR RESIDENCE IN HONOLULU THE NATIVE WOMEN WOULD PAY THEIR FAMILIES
FREQUENT FRIENDLY VISITS DAY BY DAY NOT EVEN CLOTHED WITH A BLUSH
IT WAS FOUND A HARD MATTER TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THIS WAS RATHER
INDELICATE
FINALLY THE MISSIONARIES PROVIDED THEM WITH LONG LOOSE
CALICO ROBES AND THAT ENDED THE DIFFICULTY FOR THE WOMEN WOULD TROOP
THROUGH THE TOWN STARK NAKED WITH THEIR ROBES FOLDED UNDER THEIR ARMS
MARCH TO THE MISSIONARY HOUSES AND THEN PROCEED TO DRESS THE NATIVES
SOON MANIFESTED A STRONG PROCLIVITY FOR CLOTHING BUT IT WAS SHORTLY
APPARENT THAT THEY ONLY WANTED IT FOR GRANDEUR
THE MISSIONARIES
IMPORTED A QUANTITY OF HATS BONNETS AND OTHER MALE AND FEMALE WEARING
APPAREL INSTITUTED A GENERAL DISTRIBUTION AND BEGGED THE PEOPLE NOT TO
COME TO CHURCH NAKED NEXT SUNDAY AS USUAL
AND THEY DID NOT BUT THE
NATIONAL SPIRIT OF UNSELFISHNESS LED THEM TO DIVIDE UP WITH NEIGHBORS WHO
WERE NOT AT THE DISTRIBUTION AND NEXT SABBATH THE POOR PREACHERS COULD
HARDLY KEEP COUNTENANCE BEFORE THEIR VAST CONGREGATIONS
IN THE MIDST OF
THE READING OF A HYMN A BROWN STATELY DAME WOULD SWEEP UP THE AISLE WITH
A WORLD OF AIRS WITH NOTHING IN THE WORLD ON BUT A STOVEPIPE HAT AND A
PAIR OF CHEAP GLOVES ANOTHER DAME WOULD FOLLOW TRICKED OUT IN A MAN'S
SHIRT AND NOTHING ELSE ANOTHER ONE WOULD ENTER WITH A FLOURISH WITH
SIMPLY THE SLEEVES OF A BRIGHT CALICO DRESS TIED AROUND HER WAIST AND THE
REST OF THE GARMENT DRAGGING BEHIND LIKE A PEACOCK'S TAIL OFF DUTY A
STATELY BUCK KANAKA WOULD STALK IN WITH A WOMAN'S BONNET ON WRONG SIDE
BEFORE ONLY THIS AND NOTHING MORE AFTER HIM WOULD STRIDE HIS FELLOW
WITH THE LEGS OF A PAIR OF PANTALOONS TIED AROUND HIS NECK THE REST OF
HIS PERSON UNTRAMMELED IN HIS REAR WOULD COME ANOTHER GENTLEMAN SIMPLY
GOTTEN UP IN A FIERY NECK TIE AND A STRIPED VEST
THE POOR CREATURES WERE BEAMING WITH COMPLACENCY AND WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS
OF ANY ABSURDITY IN THEIR APPEARANCE
THEY GAZED AT EACH OTHER WITH
HAPPY ADMIRATION AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT THE YOUNG GIRLS WERE
TAKING NOTE OF WHAT EACH OTHER HAD ON AS NATURALLY AS IF THEY HAD ALWAYS
LIVED IN A LAND OF BIBLES AND KNEW WHAT CHURCHES WERE MADE FOR HERE WAS
THE EVIDENCE OF A DAWNING CIVILIZATION
THE SPECTACLE WHICH THE
CONGREGATION PRESENTED WAS SO EXTRAORDINARY AND WITHAL SO MOVING THAT
THE MISSIONARIES FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP TO THE TEXT AND GO ON WITH
THE SERVICES AND BY AND BY WHEN THE SIMPLE CHILDREN OF THE SUN BEGAN A
GENERAL SWAPPING OF GARMENTS IN OPEN MEETING AND PRODUCED SOME
IRRESISTIBLY GROTESQUE EFFECTS IN THE COURSE OF RE DRESSING THERE WAS
NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO CUT THE THING SHORT WITH THE BENEDICTION AND
DISMISS THE FANTASTIC ASSEMBLAGE
IN OUR COUNTRY CHILDREN PLAY KEEP HOUSE AND IN THE SAME HIGH SOUNDING
BUT MINIATURE WAY THE GROWN FOLK HERE WITH THE POOR LITTLE MATERIAL OF
SLENDER TERRITORY AND MEAGRE POPULATION PLAY EMPIRE THERE IS HIS
ROYAL MAJESTY THE KING WITH A NEW YORK DETECTIVE'S INCOME OF THIRTY OR
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FROM THE ROYAL CIVIL LIST AND THE
ROYAL DOMAIN HE LIVES IN A TWO STORY FRAME PALACE
AND THERE IS THE ROYAL FAMILY THE CUSTOMARY HIVE OF ROYAL BROTHERS
SISTERS COUSINS AND OTHER NOBLE DRONES AND VAGRANTS USUAL TO MONARCHY
ALL WITH A SPOON IN THE NATIONAL PAP DISH AND ALL BEARING SUCH TITLES AS
HIS OR HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OR PRINCESS SO AND SO
FEW OF THEM
CAN CARRY THEIR ROYAL SPLENDORS FAR ENOUGH TO RIDE IN CARRIAGES HOWEVER
THEY SPORT THE ECONOMICAL KANAKA HORSE OR HOOF IT WITH THE PLEBEIANS
THEN THERE IS HIS EXCELLENCY THE ROYAL CHAMBERLAIN A SINECURE FOR HIS
MAJESTY DRESSES HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN HANDS EXCEPT WHEN HE IS RURALIZING
AT WAIKIKI AND THEN HE REQUIRES NO DRESSING
NEXT WE HAVE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE HOUSEHOLD
TROOPS WHOSE FORCES CONSIST OF ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS USUALLY
PLACED UNDER A CORPORAL IN OTHER LANDS
NEXT COMES THE ROYAL STEWARD AND THE GRAND EQUERRY IN WAITING HIGH
DIGNITARIES WITH MODEST SALARIES AND LITTLE TO DO
THEN WE HAVE HIS EXCELLENCY THE FIRST GENTLEMAN OF THE BED CHAMBER AN
OFFICE AS EASY AS IT IS MAGNIFICENT
NEXT WE COME TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRIME MINISTER A RENEGADE AMERICAN
FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE ALL JAW VANITY BOMBAST AND IGNORANCE A LAWYER OF
SHYSTER CALIBRE A FRAUD BY NATURE A HUMBLE WORSHIPPER OF THE SCEPTRE
ABOVE HIM A REPTILE NEVER TIRED OF SNEERING AT THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH OR
GLORIFYING THE TEN ACRE KINGDOM THAT HAS ADOPTED HIM SALARY 4 000 A
YEAR VAST CONSEQUENCE AND NO PERQUISITES
THEN WE HAVE HIS EXCELLENCY THE IMPERIAL MINISTER OF FINANCE WHO HANDLES
A MILLION DOLLARS OF PUBLIC MONEY A YEAR SENDS IN HIS ANNUAL BUDGET
WITH GREAT CEREMONY TALKS PRODIGIOUSLY OF FINANCE SUGGESTS IMPOSING
SCHEMES FOR PAYING OFF THE NATIONAL DEBT OF 150 000 AND DOES IT ALL
FOR 4 000 A YEAR AND UNIMAGINABLE GLORY
NEXT WE HAVE HIS EXCELLENCY THE MINISTER OF WAR WHO HOLDS SWAY OVER THE
ROYAL ARMIES THEY CONSIST OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY UNIFORMED KANAKAS
MOSTLY BRIGADIER GENERALS AND IF THE COUNTRY EVER GETS INTO TROUBLE WITH
A FOREIGN POWER WE SHALL PROBABLY HEAR FROM THEM
I KNEW AN AMERICAN
WHOSE COPPER PLATE VISITING CARD BORE THIS IMPRESSIVE LEGEND
LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN THE ROYAL INFANTRY TO SAY THAT HE WAS PROUD OF
THIS DISTINCTION IS STATING IT BUT TAMELY
THE MINISTER OF WAR HAS ALSO
IN HIS CHARGE SOME VENERABLE SWIVELS ON PUNCH BOWL HILL WHEREWITH ROYAL
SALUTES ARE FIRED WHEN FOREIGN VESSELS OF WAR ENTER THE PORT
NEXT COMES HIS EXCELLENCY THE MINISTER OF THE NAVY A NABOB WHO RULES THE
ROYAL FLEET A STEAM TUG AND A SIXTY TON SCHOONER
AND NEXT COMES HIS GRACE THE LORD BISHOP OF HONOLULU THE CHIEF DIGNITARY
OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH FOR WHEN THE AMERICAN PRESBYTERIAN
MISSIONARIES HAD COMPLETED THE REDUCTION OF THE NATION TO A COMPACT
CONDITION OF CHRISTIANITY NATIVE ROYALTY STEPPED IN AND ERECTED THE
GRAND DIGNITY OF AN ESTABLISHED EPISCOPAL CHURCH OVER IT AND
IMPORTED A CHEAP READY MADE BISHOP FROM ENGLAND TO TAKE CHARGE
THE
CHAGRIN OF THE MISSIONARIES HAS NEVER BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY EXPRESSED TO
THIS DAY PROFANITY NOT BEING ADMISSIBLE
NEXT COMES HIS EXCELLENCY THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION
NEXT THEIR EXCELLENCIES THE GOVERNORS OF OAHU HAWAII ETC AND AFTER
THEM A STRING OF HIGH SHERIFFS AND OTHER SMALL FRY TOO NUMEROUS FOR
COMPUTATION
THEN THERE ARE THEIR EXCELLENCIES THE ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY AND MINISTER
PLENIPOTENTIARY OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY THE EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH HER
BRITISH MAJESTY'S MINISTER THE MINISTER RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND SOME SIX OR EIGHT REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER FOREIGN NATIONS ALL WITH
SOUNDING TITLES IMPOSING DIGNITY AND PRODIGIOUS BUT ECONOMICAL STATE
IMAGINE ALL THIS GRANDEUR IN A PLAY HOUSE KINGDOM WHOSE POPULATION
FALLS ABSOLUTELY SHORT OF SIXTY THOUSAND SOULS
THE PEOPLE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO NINE JOINTED TITLES AND COLOSSAL MAGNATES
THAT A FOREIGN PRINCE MAKES VERY LITTLE MORE STIR IN HONOLULU THAN A
WESTERN CONGRESSMAN DOES IN NEW YORK
AND LET IT BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THERE IS A STRICTLY DEFINED COURT
COSTUME OF SO STUNNING A NATURE THAT IT WOULD MAKE THE CLOWN IN A
CIRCUS LOOK TAME AND COMMONPLACE BY COMPARISON AND EACH HAWAIIAN
OFFICIAL DIGNITARY HAS A GORGEOUS VARI COLORED GOLD LACED UNIFORM
PECULIAR TO HIS OFFICE NO TWO OF THEM ARE ALIKE AND IT IS HARD TO TELL
WHICH ONE IS THE LOUDEST THE KING HAD A DRAWING ROOM AT STATED
INTERVALS LIKE OTHER MONARCHS AND WHEN THESE VARIED UNIFORMS CONGREGATE
THERE WEAK EYED PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTEMPLATE THE SPECTACLE THROUGH SMOKED
GLASS
IS THERE NOT A GRATIFYING CONTRAST BETWEEN THIS LATTER DAY
EXHIBITION AND THE ONE THE ANCESTORS OF SOME OF THESE MAGNATES AFFORDED
THE MISSIONARIES THE SUNDAY AFTER THE OLD TIME DISTRIBUTION OF CLOTHING
BEHOLD WHAT RELIGION AND CIVILIZATION HAVE WROUGHT
CHAPTER LXVIII
WHILE I WAS IN HONOLULU I WITNESSED THE CEREMONIOUS FUNERAL OF THE KING'S
SISTER HER ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCESS VICTORIA
ACCORDING TO THE ROYAL
CUSTOM THE REMAINS HAD LAIN IN STATE AT THE PALACE THIRTY DAYS WATCHED
DAY AND NIGHT BY A GUARD OF HONOR
AND DURING ALL THAT TIME A GREAT
MULTITUDE OF NATIVES FROM THE SEVERAL ISLANDS HAD KEPT THE PALACE GROUNDS
WELL CROWDED AND HAD MADE THE PLACE A PANDEMONIUM EVERY NIGHT WITH THEIR
HOWLINGS AND WAILINGS BEATING OF TOM TOMS AND DANCING OF THE AT OTHER
TIMES FORBIDDEN HULA HULA BY HALF CLAD MAIDENS TO THE MUSIC OF SONGS
OF QUESTIONABLE DECENCY CHANTED IN HONOR OF THE DECEASED
THE PRINTED
PROGRAMME OF THE FUNERAL PROCESSION INTERESTED ME AT THE TIME AND AFTER
WHAT I HAVE JUST SAID OF HAWAIIAN GRANDILOQUENCE IN THE MATTER OF
PLAYING EMPIRE I AM PERSUADED THAT A PERUSAL OF IT MAY INTEREST THE
READER
AFTER READING THE LONG LIST OF DIGNITARIES ETC AND REMEMBERING
THE SPARSENESS OF THE POPULATION ONE IS ALMOST INCLINED TO WONDER

I RESUME MY JOURNAL AT THE POINT WHERE THE PROCESSION ARRIVED AT THE
ROYAL MAUSOLEUM
AS THE PROCESSION FILED THROUGH THE GATE THE MILITARY DEPLOYED
HANDSOMELY TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT AND FORMED AN AVENUE THROUGH WHICH
THE LONG COLUMN OF MOURNERS PASSED TO THE TOMB
THE COFFIN WAS
BORNE THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE MAUSOLEUM FOLLOWED BY THE KING AND
HIS CHIEFS THE GREAT OFFICERS OF THE KINGDOM FOREIGN CONSULS
EMBASSADORS AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS BURLINGAME AND GENERAL VAN
VALKENBURGH
SEVERAL OF THE KAHILIS WERE THEN FASTENED TO A
FRAME WORK IN FRONT OF THE TOMB THERE TO REMAIN UNTIL THEY DECAY
AND FALL TO PIECES OR FORESTALLING THIS UNTIL ANOTHER SCION OF
ROYALTY DIES
AT THIS POINT OF THE PROCEEDINGS THE MULTITUDE SET
UP SUCH A HEART BROKEN WAILING AS I HOPE NEVER TO HEAR AGAIN
THE SOLDIERS FIRED THREE VOLLEYS OF MUSKETRY THE WAILING BEING
PREVIOUSLY SILENCED TO PERMIT OF THE GUNS BEING HEARD
HIS HIGHNESS
PRINCE WILLIAM IN A SHOWY MILITARY UNIFORM THE TRUE PRINCE THIS
SCION OF THE HOUSE OVER THROWN BY THE PRESENT DYNASTY HE WAS FORMERLY
BETROTHED TO THE PRINCESS BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO MARRY HER STOOD GUARD
AND PACED BACK AND FORTH WITHIN THE DOOR
THE PRIVILEGED FEW WHO
FOLLOWED THE COFFIN INTO THE MAUSOLEUM REMAINED SOMETIME BUT THE KING
SOON CAME OUT AND STOOD IN THE DOOR AND NEAR ONE SIDE OF IT
A STRANGER
COULD HAVE GUESSED HIS RANK ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO SIMPLY AND
UNPRETENTIOUSLY DRESSED BY THE PROFOUND DEFERENCE PAID HIM BY ALL
PERSONS IN HIS VICINITY BY SEEING HIS HIGH OFFICERS RECEIVE HIS QUIET
ORDERS AND SUGGESTIONS WITH BOWED AND UNCOVERED HEADS AND BY OBSERVING
HOW CAREFUL THOSE PERSONS WHO CAME OUT OF THE MAUSOLEUM WERE TO AVOID
CROWDING HIM ALTHOUGH THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH IN THE DOORWAY FOR A WAGON
TO PASS FOR THAT MATTER HOW RESPECTFULLY THEY EDGED OUT SIDEWAYS
SCRAPING THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE WALL AND ALWAYS PRESENTING A FRONT VIEW
OF THEIR PERSONS TO HIS MAJESTY AND NEVER PUTTING THEIR HATS ON UNTIL
THEY WERE WELL OUT OF THE ROYAL PRESENCE
HE WAS DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK DRESS COAT AND SILK HAT AND LOOKED
RATHER DEMOCRATIC IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOWY UNIFORMS ABOUT HIM
ON HIS
BREAST HE WORE A LARGE GOLD STAR WHICH WAS HALF HIDDEN BY THE LAPEL OF
HIS COAT
HE REMAINED AT THE DOOR A HALF HOUR AND OCCASIONALLY GAVE AN
ORDER TO THE MEN WHO WERE ERECTING THE KAHILIS RANKS OF LONG HANDLED
MOPS MADE OF GAUDY FEATHERS SACRED TO ROYALTY
THEY ARE STUCK IN THE
GROUND AROUND THE TOMB AND LEFT THERE BEFORE THE TOMB
HE HAD THE
GOOD TASTE TO MAKE ONE OF THEM SUBSTITUTE BLACK CRAPE FOR THE ORDINARY
HEMPEN ROPE HE WAS ABOUT TO TIE ONE OF THEM TO THE FRAME WORK WITH
FINALLY HE ENTERED HIS CARRIAGE AND DROVE AWAY AND THE POPULACE SHORTLY
BEGAN TO DROP INTO HIS WAKE
WHILE HE WAS IN VIEW THERE WAS BUT ONE MAN
WHO ATTRACTED MORE ATTENTION THAN HIMSELF AND THAT WAS HARRIS THE
YANKEE PRIME MINISTER
THIS FEEBLE PERSONAGE HAD CRAPE ENOUGH AROUND
HIS HAT TO EXPRESS THE GRIEF OF AN ENTIRE NATION AND AS USUAL HE
NEGLECTED NO OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING HIMSELF CONSPICUOUS AND EXCITING THE
ADMIRATION OF THE SIMPLE KANAKAS
OH NOBLE AMBITION OF THIS MODERN
RICHELIEU
IT IS INTERESTING TO CONTRAST THE FUNERAL CEREMONIES OF THE PRINCESS
VICTORIA WITH THOSE OF HER NOTED ANCESTOR KAMEHAMEHA THE CONQUEROR WHO
DIED FIFTY YEARS AGO IN 1819 THE YEAR BEFORE THE FIRST MISSIONARIES
CAME
ON THE 8TH OF MAY 1819 AT THE AGE OF SIXTY SIX HE DIED AS HE
HAD LIVED IN THE FAITH OF HIS COUNTRY
IT WAS HIS MISFORTUNE NOT
TO HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH MEN WHO COULD HAVE RIGHTLY INFLUENCED
HIS RELIGIOUS ASPIRATIONS
JUDGED BY HIS ADVANTAGES AND COMPARED
WITH THE MOST EMINENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HE MAY BE JUSTLY STYLED NOT
ONLY GREAT BUT GOOD
TO THIS DAY HIS MEMORY WARMS THE HEART AND
ELEVATES THE NATIONAL FEELINGS OF HAWAIIANS
THEY ARE PROUD OF
THEIR OLD WARRIOR KING THEY LOVE HIS NAME HIS DEEDS FORM THEIR
HISTORICAL AGE AND AN ENTHUSIASM EVERYWHERE PREVAILS SHARED EVEN
BY FOREIGNERS WHO KNEW HIS WORTH THAT CONSTITUTES THE FIRMEST
PILLAR OF THE THRONE OF HIS DYNASTY
IN LIEU OF HUMAN VICTIMS THE CUSTOM OF THAT AGE A SACRIFICE OF
THREE HUNDRED DOGS ATTENDED HIS OBSEQUIES NO MEAN HOLOCAUST WHEN
THEIR NATIONAL VALUE AND THE ESTIMATION IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD ARE
CONSIDERED
THE BONES OF KAMEHAMEHA AFTER BEING KEPT FOR A WHILE
WERE SO CAREFULLY CONCEALED THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FINAL
RESTING PLACE IS NOW LOST
THERE WAS A PROVERB CURRENT AMONG THE
COMMON PEOPLE THAT THE BONES OF A CRUEL KING COULD NOT BE HID THEY
MADE FISH HOOKS AND ARROWS OF THEM UPON WHICH IN USING THEM THEY
VENTED THEIR ABHORRENCE OF HIS MEMORY IN BITTER EXECRATIONS
THE ACCOUNT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS DEATH AS WRITTEN BY THE NATIVE
HISTORIANS IS FULL OF MINUTE DETAIL BUT THERE IS SCARCELY A LINE OF IT
WHICH DOES NOT MENTION OR ILLUSTRATE SOME BY GONE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY
IN THIS RESPECT IT IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT I HAVE YET MET
WITH
I WILL QUOTE IT ENTIRE
WHEN KAMEHAMEHA WAS DANGEROUSLY SICK AND THE PRIESTS WERE UNABLE
TO CURE HIM THEY SAID 'BE OF GOOD COURAGE AND BUILD A HOUSE FOR
THE GOD' HIS OWN PRIVATE GOD OR IDOL THAT THOU MAYEST RECOVER
THE CHIEFS CORROBORATED THIS ADVICE OF THE PRIESTS AND A PLACE OF
WORSHIP WAS PREPARED FOR KUKAILIMOKU AND CONSECRATED IN THE
EVENING
THEY PROPOSED ALSO TO THE KING WITH A VIEW TO PROLONG HIS
LIFE THAT HUMAN VICTIMS SHOULD BE SACRIFICED TO HIS DEITY UPON
WHICH THE GREATER PART OF THE PEOPLE ABSCONDED THROUGH FEAR OF
DEATH AND CONCEALED THEMSELVES IN HIDING PLACES TILL THE TABU TABU
PRONOUNCED TAH BOO MEANS PROHIBITION WE HAVE BORROWED IT OR
SACRED
THE TABU WAS SOMETIMES PERMANENT SOMETIMES TEMPORARY AND
THE PERSON OR THING PLACED UNDER TABU WAS FOR THE TIME BEING SACRED
TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS SET APART
IN THE ABOVE CASE THE
VICTIMS SELECTED UNDER THE TABU WOULD BE SACRED TO THE SACRIFICE
IN WHICH DESTRUCTION IMPENDED WAS PAST
IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER
KAMEHAMEHA APPROVED OF THE PLAN OF THE CHIEFS AND PRIESTS TO
SACRIFICE MEN AS HE WAS KNOWN TO SAY 'THE MEN ARE SACRED FOR THE
KING MEANING THAT THEY WERE FOR THE SERVICE OF HIS SUCCESSOR
THIS INFORMATION WAS DERIVED FROM LIHOLIHO HIS SON
AFTER THIS HIS SICKNESS INCREASED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT HE HAD NOT
STRENGTH TO TURN HIMSELF IN HIS BED
WHEN ANOTHER SEASON
CONSECRATED FOR WORSHIP AT THE NEW TEMPLE HEIAU ARRIVED HE SAID
TO HIS SON LIHOLIHO 'GO THOU AND MAKE SUPPLICATION TO THY GOD I
AM NOT ABLE TO GO AND WILL OFFER MY PRAYERS AT HOME WHEN HIS
DEVOTIONS TO HIS FEATHERED GOD KUKAILIMOKU WERE CONCLUDED A
CERTAIN RELIGIOUSLY DISPOSED INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD A BIRD GOD
SUGGESTED TO THE KING THAT THROUGH ITS INFLUENCE HIS SICKNESS MIGHT
BE REMOVED
THE NAME OF THIS GOD WAS PUA ITS BODY WAS MADE OF A
BIRD NOW EATEN BY THE HAWAIIANS AND CALLED IN THEIR LANGUAGE ALAE
KAMEHAMEHA WAS WILLING THAT A TRIAL SHOULD BE MADE AND TWO HOUSES
WERE CONSTRUCTED TO FACILITATE THE EXPERIMENT BUT WHILE DWELLING IN
THEM HE BECAME SO VERY WEAK AS NOT TO RECEIVE FOOD
AFTER LYING
THERE THREE DAYS HIS WIVES CHILDREN AND CHIEFS PERCEIVING THAT HE
WAS VERY LOW RETURNED HIM TO HIS OWN HOUSE
IN THE EVENING HE WAS
CARRIED TO THE EATING HOUSE WHERE HE TOOK A LITTLE FOOD IN HIS
MOUTH WHICH HE DID NOT SWALLOW ALSO A CUP OF WATER
THE CHIEFS
REQUESTED HIM TO GIVE THEM HIS COUNSEL BUT HE MADE NO REPLY AND
WAS CARRIED BACK TO THE DWELLING HOUSE BUT WHEN NEAR MIDNIGHT TEN
O'CLOCK PERHAPS HE WAS CARRIED AGAIN TO THE PLACE TO EAT BUT AS
BEFORE HE MERELY TASTED OF WHAT WAS PRESENTED TO HIM
THEN
KAIKIOEWA ADDRESSED HIM THUS 'HERE WE ALL ARE YOUR YOUNGER
BRETHREN YOUR SON LIHOLIHO AND YOUR FOREIGNER IMPART TO US YOUR
DYING CHARGE THAT LIHOLIHO AND KAAHUMANU MAY HEAR THEN KAMEHAMEHA
INQUIRED 'WHAT DO YOU SAY KAIKIOEWA REPEATED 'YOUR COUNSELS FOR
US
HE THEN SAID 'MOVE ON IN MY GOOD WAY AND HE COULD PROCEED NO
FURTHER
THE FOREIGNER MR
YOUNG EMBRACED AND KISSED HIM
HOAPILI ALSO EMBRACED HIM WHISPERING SOMETHING IN HIS EAR AFTER
WHICH HE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE HOUSE
ABOUT TWELVE HE WAS CARRIED
ONCE MORE TO THE HOUSE FOR EATING INTO WHICH HIS HEAD ENTERED
WHILE HIS BODY WAS IN THE DWELLING HOUSE IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING
IT
SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT THIS FREQUENT CARRYING OF A SICK CHIEF FROM
ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER RESULTED FROM THE TABU SYSTEM THEN IN FORCE
THERE WERE AT THAT TIME SIX HOUSES HUTS CONNECTED WITH AN
ESTABLISHMENT ONE WAS FOR WORSHIP ONE FOR THE MEN TO EAT IN AN
EATING HOUSE FOR THE WOMEN A HOUSE TO SLEEP IN A HOUSE IN WHICH TO
MANUFACTURE KAPA NATIVE CLOTH AND ONE WHERE AT CERTAIN INTERVALS
THE WOMEN MIGHT DWELL IN SECLUSION
THE SICK WAS ONCE MORE TAKEN TO HIS HOUSE WHEN HE EXPIRED THIS
WAS AT TWO O'CLOCK A CIRCUMSTANCE FROM WHICH LELEIOHOKU DERIVED HIS
NAME
AS HE BREATHED HIS LAST KALAIMOKU CAME TO THE EATING HOUSE
TO ORDER THOSE IN IT TO GO OUT
THERE WERE TWO AGED PERSONS THUS
DIRECTED TO DEPART ONE WENT THE OTHER REMAINED ON ACCOUNT OF LOVE
TO THE KING BY WHOM HE HAD FORMERLY BEEN KINDLY SUSTAINED
THE
CHILDREN ALSO WERE SENT AWAY
THEN KALAIMOKU CAME TO THE HOUSE AND
THE CHIEFS HAD A CONSULTATION
ONE OF THEM SPOKE THUS 'THIS IS MY
THOUGHT WE WILL EAT HIM RAW
THIS SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS IN VIEW OF
THE FACT THAT ALL SANDWICH ISLAND HISTORIANS WHITE AND BLACK
PROTEST THAT CANNIBALISM NEVER EXISTED IN THE ISLANDS
HOWEVER
SINCE THEY ONLY PROPOSED TO EAT HIM RAW WE WON'T COUNT THAT
BUT IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN CANNIBALISM IF THEY HAD COOKED
HIM M
T KAAHUMANU ONE OF THE DEAD KING'S WIDOWS REPLIED
'PERHAPS HIS BODY IS NOT AT OUR DISPOSAL THAT IS MORE PROPERLY WITH
HIS SUCCESSOR
OUR PART IN HIM HIS BREATH HAS DEPARTED HIS
REMAINS WILL BE DISPOSED OF BY LIHOLIHO
AFTER THIS CONVERSATION THE BODY WAS TAKEN INTO THE CONSECRATED
HOUSE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPER RITES BY THE PRIEST AND THE
NEW KING
THE NAME OF THIS CEREMONY IS UKO AND WHEN THE SACRED HOG
WAS BAKED THE PRIEST OFFERED IT TO THE DEAD BODY AND IT BECAME A
GOD THE KING AT THE SAME TIME REPEATING THE CUSTOMARY PRAYERS
THEN THE PRIEST ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THE KING AND CHIEFS SAID
'I WILL NOW MAKE KNOWN TO YOU THE RULES TO BE OBSERVED RESPECTING
PERSONS TO BE SACRIFICED ON THE BURIAL OF THIS BODY
IF YOU OBTAIN
ONE MAN BEFORE THE CORPSE IS REMOVED ONE WILL BE SUFFICIENT BUT
AFTER IT LEAVES THIS HOUSE FOUR WILL BE REQUIRED
IF DELAYED UNTIL
WE CARRY THE CORPSE TO THE GRAVE THERE MUST BE TEN BUT AFTER IT IS
DEPOSITED IN THE GRAVE THERE MUST BE FIFTEEN
TO MORROW MORNING
THERE WILL BE A TABU AND IF THE SACRIFICE BE DELAYED UNTIL THAT
TIME FORTY MEN MUST DIE
THEN THE HIGH PRIEST HEWAHEWA INQUIRED OF THE CHIEFS 'WHERE
SHALL BE THE RESIDENCE OF KING LIHOLIHO THEY REPLIED 'WHERE
INDEED YOU OF ALL MEN OUGHT TO KNOW THEN THE PRIEST OBSERVED
'THERE ARE TWO SUITABLE PLACES ONE IS KAU THE OTHER IS KOHALA
THE CHIEFS PREFERRED THE LATTER AS IT WAS MORE THICKLY INHABITED
THE PRIEST ADDED 'THESE ARE PROPER PLACES FOR THE KING'S RESIDENCE
BUT HE MUST NOT REMAIN IN KONA FOR IT IS POLLUTED THIS WAS
AGREED TO
IT WAS NOW BREAK OF DAY
AS HE WAS BEING CARRIED TO THE
PLACE OF BURIAL THE PEOPLE PERCEIVED THAT THEIR KING WAS DEAD AND
THEY WAILED
WHEN THE CORPSE WAS REMOVED FROM THE HOUSE TO THE
TOMB A DISTANCE OF ONE CHAIN THE PROCESSION WAS MET BY A CERTAIN
MAN WHO WAS ARDENTLY ATTACHED TO THE DECEASED
HE LEAPED UPON THE
CHIEFS WHO WERE CARRYING THE KING'S BODY HE DESIRED TO DIE WITH HIM
ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOVE
THE CHIEFS DROVE HIM AWAY
HE PERSISTED IN
MAKING NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS WHICH WERE UNAVAILING
KALAIMOKA ALSO HAD
IT IN HIS HEART TO DIE WITH HIM BUT WAS PREVENTED BY HOOKIO
THE MORNING FOLLOWING KAMEHAMEHA'S DEATH LIHOLIHO AND HIS TRAIN
DEPARTED FOR KOHALA ACCORDING TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE PRIEST TO
AVOID THE DEFILEMENT OCCASIONED BY THE DEAD
AT THIS TIME IF A
CHIEF DIED THE LAND WAS POLLUTED AND THE HEIRS SOUGHT A RESIDENCE
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY UNTIL THE CORPSE WAS DISSECTED AND
THE BONES TIED IN A BUNDLE WHICH BEING DONE THE SEASON OF
DEFILEMENT TERMINATED
IF THE DECEASED WERE NOT A CHIEF THE HOUSE
ONLY WAS DEFILED WHICH BECAME PURE AGAIN ON THE BURIAL OF THE BODY
SUCH WERE THE LAWS ON THIS SUBJECT
ON THE MORNING ON WHICH LIHOLIHO SAILED IN HIS CANOE FOR KOHALA
THE CHIEFS AND PEOPLE MOURNED AFTER THEIR MANNER ON OCCASION OF A
CHIEF'S DEATH CONDUCTING THEMSELVES LIKE MADMEN AND LIKE BEASTS
THEIR CONDUCT WAS SUCH AS TO FORBID DESCRIPTION THE PRIESTS ALSO
PUT INTO ACTION THE SORCERY APPARATUS THAT THE PERSON WHO HAD
PRAYED THE KING TO DEATH MIGHT DIE FOR IT WAS NOT BELIEVED THAT
KAMEHAMEHA'S DEPARTURE WAS THE EFFECT EITHER OF SICKNESS OR OLD AGE
WHEN THE SORCERERS SET UP BY THEIR FIRE PLACES STICKS WITH A STRIP
OF KAPA FLYING AT THE TOP THE CHIEF KEEAUMOKU KAAHUMAUN'S BROTHER
CAME IN A STATE OF INTOXICATION AND BROKE THE FLAG STAFF OF THE
SORCERERS FROM WHICH IT WAS INFERRED THAT KAAHUMANU AND HER FRIENDS
HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE KING'S DEATH
ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY
WERE SUBJECTED TO ABUSE
YOU HAVE THE CONTRAST NOW AND A STRANGE ONE IT IS
THIS GREAT QUEEN
KAAHUMANU WHO WAS SUBJECTED TO ABUSE DURING THE FRIGHTFUL ORGIES THAT
FOLLOWED THE KING'S DEATH IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANCIENT CUSTOM AFTERWARD
BECAME A DEVOUT CHRISTIAN AND A STEADFAST AND POWERFUL FRIEND OF THE
MISSIONARIES
DOGS WERE AND STILL ARE REARED AND FATTENED FOR FOOD BY THE NATIVES
HENCE THE REFERENCE TO THEIR VALUE IN ONE OF THE ABOVE PARAGRAPHS
FORTY YEARS AGO IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN THE ISLANDS TO SUSPEND ALL LAW FOR A
CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS AFTER THE DEATH OF A ROYAL PERSONAGE AND THEN A
SATURNALIA ENSUED WHICH ONE MAY PICTURE TO HIMSELF AFTER A FASHION BUT
NOT IN THE FULL HORROR OF THE REALITY
THE PEOPLE SHAVED THEIR HEADS
KNOCKED OUT A TOOTH OR TWO PLUCKED OUT AN EYE SOMETIMES CUT BRUISED
MUTILATED OR BURNED THEIR FLESH GOT DRUNK BURNED EACH OTHER'S HUTS
MAIMED OR MURDERED ONE ANOTHER ACCORDING TO THE CAPRICE OF THE MOMENT
AND BOTH SEXES GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO BRUTAL AND UNBRIDLED LICENTIOUSNESS
AND AFTER IT ALL CAME A TORPOR FROM WHICH THE NATION SLOWLY EMERGED
BEWILDERED AND DAZED AS IF FROM A HIDEOUS HALF REMEMBERED NIGHTMARE
THEY WERE NOT THE SALT OF THE EARTH THOSE GENTLE CHILDREN OF THE SUN
THE NATIVES STILL KEEP UP AN OLD CUSTOM OF THEIRS WHICH CANNOT BE
COMFORTING TO AN INVALID
WHEN THEY THINK A SICK FRIEND IS GOING TO DIE
A COUPLE OF DOZEN NEIGHBORS SURROUND HIS HUT AND KEEP UP A DEAFENING
WAILING NIGHT AND DAY TILL HE EITHER DIES OR GETS WELL
NO DOUBT THIS
ARRANGEMENT HAS HELPED MANY A SUBJECT TO A SHROUD BEFORE HIS APPOINTED
TIME
THEY SURROUND A HUT AND WAIL IN THE SAME HEART BROKEN WAY WHEN ITS
OCCUPANT RETURNS FROM A JOURNEY
THIS IS THEIR DISMAL IDEA OF A WELCOME
A VERY LITTLE OF IT WOULD GO A GREAT WAY WITH MOST OF US
CHAPTER LXIX
BOUND FOR HAWAII A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES DISTANT TO VISIT THE GREAT
VOLCANO AND BEHOLD THE OTHER NOTABLE THINGS WHICH DISTINGUISH THAT ISLAND
ABOVE THE REMAINDER OF THE GROUP WE SAILED FROM HONOLULU ON A CERTAIN
SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN THE GOOD SCHOONER BOOMERANG
THE BOOMERANG WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS TWO STREET CARS AND ABOUT AS WIDE AS
ONE
SHE WAS SO SMALL THOUGH SHE WAS LARGER THAN THE MAJORITY OF THE
INTER ISLAND COASTERS THAT WHEN I STOOD ON HER DECK I FELT BUT LITTLE
SMALLER THAN THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES MUST HAVE FELT WHEN HE HAD A
MAN OF WAR UNDER HIM
I COULD REACH THE WATER WHEN SHE LAY OVER UNDER A
STRONG BREEZE
WHEN THE CAPTAIN AND MY COMRADE A MR
BILLINGS MYSELF
AND FOUR OTHER PERSONS WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ON THE LITTLE AFTER PORTION OF
THE DECK WHICH IS SACRED TO THE CABIN PASSENGERS IT WAS FULL THERE WAS
NOT ROOM FOR ANY MORE QUALITY FOLKS
ANOTHER SECTION OF THE DECK TWICE
AS LARGE AS OURS WAS FULL OF NATIVES OF BOTH SEXES WITH THEIR CUSTOMARY
DOGS MATS BLANKETS PIPES CALABASHES OF POI FLEAS AND OTHER LUXURIES
AND BAGGAGE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE
AS SOON AS WE SET SAIL THE NATIVES ALL
LAY DOWN ON THE DECK AS THICK AS NEGROES IN A SLAVE PEN AND SMOKED
CONVERSED AND SPIT ON EACH OTHER AND WERE TRULY SOCIABLE
THE LITTLE LOW CEILED CABIN BELOW WAS RATHER LARGER THAN A HEARSE AND AS
DARK AS A VAULT
IT HAD TWO COFFINS ON EACH SIDE I MEAN TWO BUNKS
A SMALL TABLE CAPABLE OF ACCOMMODATING THREE PERSONS AT DINNER STOOD
AGAINST THE FORWARD BULKHEAD AND OVER IT HUNG THE DINGIEST WHALE OIL
LANTERN THAT EVER PEOPLED THE OBSCURITY OF A DUNGEON WITH GHOSTLY SHAPES
THE FLOOR ROOM UNOCCUPIED WAS NOT EXTENSIVE
ONE MIGHT SWING A CAT IN
IT PERHAPS BUT NOT A LONG CAT
THE HOLD FORWARD OF THE BULKHEAD HAD
BUT LITTLE FREIGHT IN IT AND FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT A PORTLY OLD
ROOSTER WITH A VOICE LIKE BAALAM'S ASS AND THE SAME DISPOSITION TO USE
IT STRUTTED UP AND DOWN IN THAT PART OF THE VESSEL AND CROWED
HE
USUALLY TOOK DINNER AT SIX O'CLOCK AND THEN AFTER AN HOUR DEVOTED TO
MEDITATION HE MOUNTED A BARREL AND CROWED A GOOD PART OF THE NIGHT
HE GOT HOARSER ALL THE TIME BUT HE SCORNED TO ALLOW ANY PERSONAL
CONSIDERATION TO INTERFERE WITH HIS DUTY AND KEPT UP HIS LABORS IN
DEFIANCE OF THREATENED DIPHTHERIA
SLEEPING WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION WHEN HE WAS ON WATCH
HE WAS A SOURCE
OF GENUINE AGGRAVATION AND ANNOYANCE
IT WAS WORSE THAN USELESS TO SHOUT
AT HIM OR APPLY OFFENSIVE EPITHETS TO HIM HE ONLY TOOK THESE THINGS FOR
APPLAUSE AND STRAINED HIMSELF TO MAKE MORE NOISE
OCCASIONALLY DURING
THE DAY I THREW POTATOES AT HIM THROUGH AN APERTURE IN THE BULKHEAD BUT
HE ONLY DODGED AND WENT ON CROWING
THE FIRST NIGHT AS I LAY IN MY COFFIN IDLY WATCHING THE DIM LAMP
SWINGING TO THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP AND SNUFFING THE NAUSEOUS ODORS OF
BILGE WATER I FELT SOMETHING GALLOP OVER ME
I TURNED OUT PROMPTLY
HOWEVER I TURNED IN AGAIN WHEN I FOUND IT WAS ONLY A RAT
PRESENTLY
SOMETHING GALLOPED OVER ME ONCE MORE
I KNEW IT WAS NOT A RAT THIS TIME
AND I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A CENTIPEDE BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN HAD KILLED ONE
ON DECK IN THE AFTERNOON
I TURNED OUT
THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE PILLOW
SHOWED ME REPULSIVE SENTINEL PERCHED UPON EACH END OF IT COCKROACHES AS
LARGE AS PEACH LEAVES FELLOWS WITH LONG QUIVERING ANTENNAE AND FIERY
MALIGNANT EYES
THEY WERE GRATING THEIR TEETH LIKE TOBACCO WORMS AND
APPEARED TO BE DISSATISFIED ABOUT SOMETHING
I HAD OFTEN HEARD THAT
THESE REPTILES WERE IN THE HABIT OF EATING OFF SLEEPING SAILORS' TOE
NAILS DOWN TO THE QUICK AND I WOULD NOT GET IN THE BUNK ANY MORE
I LAY
DOWN ON THE FLOOR
BUT A RAT CAME AND BOTHERED ME AND SHORTLY AFTERWARD
A PROCESSION OF COCKROACHES ARRIVED AND CAMPED IN MY HAIR
IN A FEW
MOMENTS THE ROOSTER WAS CROWING WITH UNCOMMON SPIRIT AND A PARTY OF FLEAS
WERE THROWING DOUBLE SOMERSAULTS ABOUT MY PERSON IN THE WILDEST DISORDER
AND TAKING A BITE EVERY TIME THEY STRUCK
I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL REALLY
ANNOYED
I GOT UP AND PUT MY CLOTHES ON AND WENT ON DECK
THE ABOVE IS NOT OVERDRAWN IT IS A TRUTHFUL SKETCH OF INTER ISLAND
SCHOONER LIFE
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS KEEPING A VESSEL IN ELEGANT
CONDITION WHEN SHE CARRIES MOLASSES AND KANAKAS
IT WAS COMPENSATION FOR MY SUFFERINGS TO COME UNEXPECTEDLY UPON SO
BEAUTIFUL A SCENE AS MET MY EYE TO STEP SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SEPULCHRAL
GLOOM OF THE CABIN AND STAND UNDER THE STRONG LIGHT OF THE MOON IN THE
CENTRE AS IT WERE OF A GLITTERING SEA OF LIQUID SILVER TO SEE THE
BROAD SAILS STRAINING IN THE GALE THE SHIP HEELED OVER ON HER SIDE THE
ANGRY FOAM HISSING PAST HER LEE BULWARKS AND SPARKLING SHEETS OF SPRAY
DASHING HIGH OVER HER BOWS AND RAINING UPON HER DECKS TO BRACE MYSELF
AND HANG FAST TO THE FIRST OBJECT THAT PRESENTED ITSELF WITH HAT JAMMED
DOWN AND COAT TAILS WHIPPING IN THE BREEZE AND FEEL THAT EXHILARATION
THAT THRILLS IN ONE'S HAIR AND QUIVERS DOWN HIS BACK BONE WHEN HE KNOWS
THAT EVERY INCH OF CANVAS IS DRAWING AND THE VESSEL CLEAVING THROUGH THE
WAVES AT HER UTMOST SPEED
THERE WAS NO DARKNESS NO DIMNESS NO
OBSCURITY THERE
ALL WAS BRIGHTNESS EVERY OBJECT WAS VIVIDLY DEFINED
EVERY PROSTRATE KANAKA EVERY COIL OF ROPE EVERY CALABASH OF POI EVERY
PUPPY EVERY SEAM IN THE FLOORING EVERY BOLTHEAD EVERY OBJECT HOWEVER
MINUTE SHOWED SHARP AND DISTINCT IN ITS EVERY OUTLINE AND THE SHADOW OF
THE BROAD MAINSAIL LAY BLACK AS A PALL UPON THE DECK LEAVING BILLINGS'S
WHITE UPTURNED FACE GLORIFIED AND HIS BODY IN A TOTAL ECLIPSE
MONDAY MORNING WE WERE CLOSE TO THE ISLAND OF HAWAII
TWO OF ITS HIGH
MOUNTAINS WERE IN VIEW MAUNA LOA AND HUALAIAI
THE LATTER IS AN IMPOSING PEAK BUT BEING ONLY TEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH IS
SELDOM MENTIONED OR HEARD OF
MAUNA LOA IS SAID TO BE SIXTEEN THOUSAND
FEET HIGH
THE RAYS OF GLITTERING SNOW AND ICE THAT CLASPED ITS SUMMIT
LIKE A CLAW LOOKED REFRESHING WHEN VIEWED FROM THE BLISTERING CLIMATE WE
WERE IN
ONE COULD STAND ON THAT MOUNTAIN WRAPPED UP IN BLANKETS AND
FURS TO KEEP WARM AND WHILE HE NIBBLED A SNOWBALL OR AN ICICLE TO
QUENCH HIS THIRST HE COULD LOOK DOWN THE LONG SWEEP OF ITS SIDES AND SEE
SPOTS WHERE PLANTS ARE GROWING THAT GROW ONLY WHERE THE BITTER COLD OF
WINTER PREVAILS LOWER DOWN HE COULD SEE SECTIONS DEVOTED TO PRODUCTION
THAT THRIVE IN THE TEMPERATE ZONE ALONE AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
MOUNTAIN HE COULD SEE THE HOME OF THE TUFTED COCOA PALMS AND OTHER
SPECIES OF VEGETATION THAT GROW ONLY IN THE SULTRY ATMOSPHERE OF ETERNAL
SUMMER
HE COULD SEE ALL THE CLIMES OF THE WORLD AT A SINGLE GLANCE OF
THE EYE AND THAT GLANCE WOULD ONLY PASS OVER A DISTANCE OF FOUR OR FIVE
MILES AS THE BIRD FLIES
BY AND BY WE TOOK BOAT AND WENT ASHORE AT KAILUA DESIGNING TO RIDE
HORSEBACK THROUGH THE PLEASANT ORANGE AND COFFEE REGION OF KONA AND
REJOIN THE VESSEL AT A POINT SOME LEAGUES DISTANT
THIS JOURNEY IS WELL
WORTH TAKING
THE TRAIL PASSES ALONG ON HIGH GROUND SAY A THOUSAND FEET
ABOVE SEA LEVEL AND USUALLY ABOUT A MILE DISTANT FROM THE OCEAN WHICH
IS ALWAYS IN SIGHT SAVE THAT OCCASIONALLY YOU FIND YOURSELF BURIED IN
THE FOREST IN THE MIDST OF A RANK TROPICAL VEGETATION AND A DENSE GROWTH
OF TREES WHOSE GREAT BOWS OVERARCH THE ROAD AND SHUT OUT SUN AND SEA AND
EVERYTHING AND LEAVE YOU IN A DIM SHADY TUNNEL HAUNTED WITH INVISIBLE
SINGING BIRDS AND FRAGRANT WITH THE ODOR OF FLOWERS
IT WAS PLEASANT TO
RIDE OCCASIONALLY IN THE WARM SUN AND FEAST THE EYE UPON THE
EVER CHANGING PANORAMA OF THE FOREST BEYOND AND BELOW US WITH ITS MANY
TINTS ITS SOFTENED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS ITS BILLOWY UNDULATIONS SWEEPING
GENTLY DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN TO THE SEA
IT WAS PLEASANT ALSO AT
INTERVALS TO LEAVE THE SULTRY SUN AND PASS INTO THE COOL GREEN DEPTHS
OF THIS FOREST AND INDULGE IN SENTIMENTAL REFLECTIONS UNDER THE
INSPIRATION OF ITS BROODING TWILIGHT AND ITS WHISPERING FOLIAGE
WE RODE THROUGH ONE ORANGE GROVE THAT HAD TEN THOUSAND TREE IN IT
THEY WERE ALL LADEN WITH FRUIT
AT ONE FARMHOUSE WE GOT SOME LARGE PEACHES OF EXCELLENT FLAVOR
THIS FRUIT AS A GENERAL THING DOES NOT DO WELL IN THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
IT TAKES A SORT OF ALMOND SHAPE AND IS SMALL AND BITTER
IT NEEDS
FROST THEY SAY AND PERHAPS IT DOES IF THIS BE SO IT WILL HAVE A GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO GO ON NEEDING IT AS IT WILL NOT BE LIKELY TO GET IT
THE TREES FROM WHICH THE FINE FRUIT I HAVE SPOKEN OF CAME HAD BEEN
PLANTED AND REPLANTED SIXTEEN TIMES AND TO THIS TREATMENT THE PROPRIETOR
OF THE ORCHARD ATTRIBUTED HIS SUCCESS
WE PASSED SEVERAL SUGAR PLANTATIONS NEW ONES AND NOT VERY EXTENSIVE
THE CROPS WERE IN MOST CASES THIRD RATTOONS
NOTE THE FIRST CROP IS
CALLED PLANT CANE SUBSEQUENT CROPS WHICH SPRING FROM THE ORIGINAL
ROOTS WITHOUT REPLANTING ARE CALLED RATTOONS ALMOST EVERYWHERE ON
THE ISLAND OF HAWAII SUGAR CANE MATURES IN TWELVE MONTHS BOTH RATTOONS
AND PLANT AND ALTHOUGH IT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN OFF AS SOON AS IT TASSELS
NO DOUBT IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO IT UNTIL ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
AFTERWARD
IN KONA THE AVERAGE YIELD OF AN ACRE OF GROUND IS TWO TONS
OF SUGAR THEY SAY
THIS IS ONLY A MODERATE YIELD FOR THESE ISLANDS BUT
WOULD BE ASTOUNDING FOR LOUISIANA AND MOST OTHER SUGAR GROWING COUNTRIES
THE PLANTATIONS IN KONA BEING ON PRETTY HIGH GROUND UP AMONG THE LIGHT
AND FREQUENT RAINS NO IRRIGATION WHATEVER IS REQUIRED
CHAPTER LXX
WE STOPPED SOME TIME AT ONE OF THE PLANTATIONS TO REST OURSELVES AND
REFRESH THE HORSES
WE HAD A CHATTY CONVERSATION WITH SEVERAL GENTLEMEN
PRESENT BUT THERE WAS ONE PERSON A MIDDLE AGED MAN WITH AN ABSENT LOOK
IN HIS FACE WHO SIMPLY GLANCED UP GAVE US GOOD DAY AND LAPSED AGAIN
INTO THE MEDITATIONS WHICH OUR COMING HAD INTERRUPTED
THE PLANTERS
WHISPERED US NOT TO MIND HIM CRAZY
THEY SAID HE WAS IN THE ISLANDS FOR
HIS HEALTH WAS A PREACHER HIS HOME MICHIGAN
THEY SAID THAT IF HE
WOKE UP PRESENTLY AND FELL TO TALKING ABOUT A CORRESPONDENCE WHICH HE HAD
SOME TIME HELD WITH MR
GREELEY ABOUT A TRIFLE OF SOME KIND WE MUST
HUMOR HIM AND LISTEN WITH INTEREST AND WE MUST HUMOR HIS FANCY THAT THIS
CORRESPONDENCE WAS THE TALK OF THE WORLD
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HE WAS A GENTLE CREATURE AND THAT HIS MADNESS HAD
NOTHING VICIOUS IN IT
HE LOOKED PALE AND A LITTLE WORN AS IF WITH
PERPLEXING THOUGHT AND ANXIETY OF MIND
HE SAT A LONG TIME LOOKING AT
THE FLOOR AND AT INTERVALS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND NODDING HIS HEAD
ACQUIESCINGLY OR SHAKING IT IN MILD PROTEST
HE WAS LOST IN HIS THOUGHT
OR IN HIS MEMORIES
WE CONTINUED OUR TALK WITH THE PLANTERS BRANCHING
FROM SUBJECT TO SUBJECT
BUT AT LAST THE WORD CIRCUMSTANCE CASUALLY
DROPPED IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION AND
BROUGHT AN EAGER LOOK INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
HE FACED ABOUT IN HIS CHAIR
AND SAID
CIRCUMSTANCE WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE AH I KNOW I KNOW TOO WELL
SO YOU
HAVE HEARD OF IT TOO WITH A SIGH WELL NO MATTER ALL THE WORLD
HAS HEARD OF IT
ALL THE WORLD
THE WHOLE WORLD
IT IS A LARGE WORLD
TOO FOR A THING TO TRAVEL SO FAR IN NOW ISN'T IT YES YES THE
GREELEY CORRESPONDENCE WITH ERICKSON HAS CREATED THE SADDEST AND
BITTEREST CONTROVERSY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE OCEAN AND STILL THEY KEEP IT
UP IT MAKES US FAMOUS BUT AT WHAT A SORROWFUL SACRIFICE I WAS SO
SORRY WHEN I HEARD THAT IT HAD CAUSED THAT BLOODY AND DISTRESSFUL WAR
OVER THERE IN ITALY
IT WAS LITTLE COMFORT TO ME AFTER SO MUCH
BLOODSHED TO KNOW THAT THE VICTORS SIDED WITH ME AND THE VANQUISHED
WITH GREELEY IT IS LITTLE COMFORT TO KNOW THAT HORACE GREELEY IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BATTLE OF SADOWA AND NOT ME
QUEEN VICTORIA WROTE ME THAT SHE FELT JUST AS I DID ABOUT IT SHE SAID
THAT AS MUCH AS SHE WAS OPPOSED TO GREELEY AND THE SPIRIT HE SHOWED IN
THE CORRESPONDENCE WITH ME SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD SADOWA HAPPEN FOR
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS
I CAN SHOW YOU HER LETTER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE
IT
BUT GENTLEMEN MUCH AS YOU MAY THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT UNHAPPY
CORRESPONDENCE YOU CANNOT KNOW THE STRAIGHT OF IT TILL YOU HEAR IT FROM
MY LIPS
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARBLED IN THE JOURNALS AND EVEN IN
HISTORY
YES EVEN IN HISTORY THINK OF IT LET ME PLEASE LET ME GIVE
YOU THE MATTER EXACTLY AS IT OCCURRED
I TRULY WILL NOT ABUSE YOUR
CONFIDENCE
THEN HE LEANED FORWARD ALL INTEREST ALL EARNESTNESS AND TOLD HIS
STORY AND TOLD IT APPEALINGLY TOO AND YET IN THE SIMPLEST AND MOST
UNPRETENTIOUS WAY INDEED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO SUGGEST TO ONE ALL THE
TIME THAT THIS WAS A FAITHFUL HONORABLE WITNESS GIVING EVIDENCE IN THE
SACRED INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND UNDER OATH
HE SAID
MRS
BEAZELEY MRS
JACKSON BEAZELEY WIDOW OF THE VILLAGE OF
CAMPBELLTON KANSAS WROTE ME ABOUT A MATTER WHICH WAS NEAR HER HEART
A MATTER WHICH MANY MIGHT THINK TRIVIAL BUT TO HER IT WAS A THING OF
DEEP CONCERN
I WAS LIVING IN MICHIGAN THEN SERVING IN THE MINISTRY
SHE WAS AND IS AN ESTIMABLE WOMAN A WOMAN TO WHOM POVERTY AND HARDSHIP
HAVE PROVEN INCENTIVES TO INDUSTRY IN PLACE OF DISCOURAGEMENTS
HER ONLY TREASURE WAS HER SON WILLIAM A YOUTH JUST VERGING UPON MANHOOD
RELIGIOUS AMIABLE AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO AGRICULTURE
HE WAS THE
WIDOW'S COMFORT AND HER PRIDE
AND SO MOVED BY HER LOVE FOR HIM SHE
WROTE ME ABOUT A MATTER AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE WHICH LAY NEAR HER HEART
BECAUSE IT LAY NEAR HER BOY'S
SHE DESIRED ME TO CONFER WITH
MR
GREELEY ABOUT TURNIPS
TURNIPS WERE THE DREAM OF HER CHILD'S YOUNG
AMBITION
WHILE OTHER YOUTHS WERE FRITTERING AWAY IN FRIVOLOUS
AMUSEMENTS THE PRECIOUS YEARS OF BUDDING VIGOR WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN THEM
FOR USEFUL PREPARATION THIS BOY WAS PATIENTLY ENRICHING HIS MIND WITH
INFORMATION CONCERNING TURNIPS
THE SENTIMENT WHICH HE FELT TOWARD THE
TURNIP WAS AKIN TO ADORATION
HE COULD NOT THINK OF THE TURNIP WITHOUT
EMOTION HE COULD NOT SPEAK OF IT CALMLY HE COULD NOT CONTEMPLATE IT
WITHOUT EXALTATION
HE COULD NOT EAT IT WITHOUT SHEDDING TEARS
ALL THE
POETRY IN HIS SENSITIVE NATURE WAS IN SYMPATHY WITH THE GRACIOUS
VEGETABLE
WITH THE EARLIEST PIPE OF DAWN HE SOUGHT HIS PATCH AND WHEN
THE CURTAINING NIGHT DROVE HIM FROM IT HE SHUT HIMSELF UP WITH HIS BOOKS
AND GARNERED STATISTICS TILL SLEEP OVERCAME HIM
ON RAINY DAYS HE SAT
AND TALKED HOURS TOGETHER WITH HIS MOTHER ABOUT TURNIPS
WHEN COMPANY
CAME HE MADE IT HIS LOVING DUTY TO PUT ASIDE EVERYTHING ELSE AND
CONVERSE WITH THEM ALL THE DAY LONG OF HIS GREAT JOY IN THE TURNIP
AND YET WAS THIS JOY ROUNDED AND COMPLETE WAS THERE NO SECRET ALLOY OF
UNHAPPINESS IN IT ALAS THERE WAS
THERE WAS A CANKER GNAWING AT HIS
HEART THE NOBLEST INSPIRATION OF HIS SOUL ELUDED HIS ENDEAVOR VIZ HE
COULD NOT MAKE OF THE TURNIP A CLIMBING VINE
MONTHS WENT BY THE BLOOM
FORSOOK HIS CHEEK THE FIRE FADED OUT OF HIS EYE SIGHINGS AND
ABSTRACTION USURPED THE PLACE OF SMILES AND CHEERFUL CONVERSE
BUT A
WATCHFUL EYE NOTED THESE THINGS AND IN TIME A MOTHERLY SYMPATHY UNSEALED
THE SECRET
HENCE THE LETTER TO ME
SHE PLEADED FOR ATTENTION SHE SAID
HER BOY WAS DYING BY INCHES
I WAS A STRANGER TO MR
GREELEY BUT WHAT OF THAT THE MATTER WAS
URGENT
I WROTE AND BEGGED HIM TO SOLVE THE DIFFICULT PROBLEM IF
POSSIBLE AND SAVE THE STUDENT'S LIFE
MY INTEREST GREW UNTIL IT PARTOOK
OF THE ANXIETY OF THE MOTHER
I WAITED IN MUCH SUSPENSE AT LAST THE
ANSWER CAME
I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT READ IT READILY THE HANDWRITING BEING
UNFAMILIAR AND MY EMOTIONS SOMEWHAT WROUGHT UP
IT SEEMED TO REFER IN
PART TO THE BOY'S CASE BUT CHIEFLY TO OTHER AND IRRELEVANT MATTERS SUCH
AS PAVING STONES ELECTRICITY OYSTERS AND SOMETHING WHICH I TOOK TO BE
'ABSOLUTION' OR 'AGRARIANISM I COULD NOT BE CERTAIN WHICH STILL THESE
APPEARED TO BE SIMPLY CASUAL MENTIONS NOTHING MORE FRIENDLY IN SPIRIT
WITHOUT DOUBT BUT LACKING THE CONNECTION OR COHERENCE NECESSARY TO MAKE
THEM USEFUL I JUDGED THAT MY UNDERSTANDING WAS AFFECTED BY MY FEELINGS
AND SO LAID THE LETTER AWAY TILL MORNING
IN THE MORNING I READ IT AGAIN BUT WITH DIFFICULTY AND UNCERTAINTY
STILL FOR I HAD LOST SOME LITTLE REST AND MY MENTAL VISION SEEMED
CLOUDED
THE NOTE WAS MORE CONNECTED NOW BUT DID NOT MEET THE
EMERGENCY IT WAS EXPECTED TO MEET
IT WAS TOO DISCURSIVE
IT APPEARED
TO READ AS FOLLOWS THOUGH I WAS NOT CERTAIN OF SOME OF THE WORDS
POLYGAMY DISSEMBLES MAJESTY EXTRACTS REDEEM POLARITY CAUSES
HITHERTO EXIST
OVATIONS PURSUE WISDOM OR WARTS INHERIT AND
CONDEMN
BOSTON BOTANY CAKES FOLONY UNDERTAKES BUT WHO SHALL
ALLAY WE FEAR NOT
YRXWLY
HEVACE EVEELOJ
BUT THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE A WORD ABOUT TURNIPS
THERE SEEMED TO BE
NO SUGGESTION AS TO HOW THEY MIGHT BE MADE TO GROW LIKE VINES
THERE WAS
NOT EVEN A REFERENCE TO THE BEAZELEYS
I SLEPT UPON THE MATTER I ATE NO
SUPPER NEITHER ANY BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING
SO I RESUMED MY WORK WITH A
BRAIN REFRESHED AND WAS VERY HOPEFUL
NOW THE LETTER TOOK A DIFFERENT
ASPECT ALL SAVE THE SIGNATURE WHICH LATTER I JUDGED TO BE ONLY A
HARMLESS AFFECTATION OF HEBREW
THE EPISTLE WAS NECESSARILY FROM MR
GREELEY FOR IT BORE THE PRINTED HEADING OF THE TRIBUNE AND I HAD
WRITTEN TO NO ONE ELSE THERE
THE LETTER I SAY HAD TAKEN A DIFFERENT
ASPECT BUT STILL ITS LANGUAGE WAS ECCENTRIC AND AVOIDED THE ISSUE
IT
NOW APPEARED TO SAY
BOLIVIA EXTEMPORIZES MACKEREL BORAX ESTEEMS POLYGAMY SAUSAGES
WITHER IN THE EAST
CREATION PERDU IS DONE FOR WOES INHERENT ONE
CAN DAMN
BUTTONS BUTTONS CORKS GEOLOGY UNDERRATES BUT WE SHALL
ALLAY
MY BEER'S OUT
YRXWLY
HEVACE EVEELOJ
I WAS EVIDENTLY OVERWORKED
MY COMPREHENSION WAS IMPAIRED
THEREFORE I
GAVE TWO DAYS TO RECREATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MY TASK GREATLY
REFRESHED
THE LETTER NOW TOOK THIS FORM
POULTICES DO SOMETIMES CHOKE SWINE TULIPS REDUCE POSTERITY CAUSES
LEATHER TO RESIST
OUR NOTIONS EMPOWER WISDOM HER LET'S AFFORD
WHILE WE CAN
BUTTER BUT ANY CAKES FILL ANY UNDERTAKER WE'LL WEAN
HIM FROM HIS FILLY
WE FEEL HOT
YRXWLY HEVACE EVEELOJ
I WAS STILL NOT SATISFIED
THESE GENERALITIES DID NOT MEET THE
QUESTION
THEY WERE CRISP AND VIGOROUS AND DELIVERED WITH A CONFIDENCE
THAT ALMOST COMPELLED CONVICTION BUT AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS WITH A
HUMAN LIFE AT STAKE THEY SEEMED INAPPROPRIATE WORLDLY AND IN BAD
TASTE
AT ANY OTHER TIME I WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT ONLY GLAD BUT PROUD TO
RECEIVE FROM A MAN LIKE MR
GREELEY A LETTER OF THIS KIND AND WOULD HAVE
STUDIED IT EARNESTLY AND TRIED TO IMPROVE MYSELF ALL I COULD BUT NOW
WITH THAT POOR BOY IN HIS FAR HOME LANGUISHING FOR RELIEF I HAD NO HEART
FOR LEARNING
THREE DAYS PASSED BY AND I READ THE NOTE AGAIN
AGAIN ITS TENOR HAD
CHANGED
IT NOW APPEARED TO SAY
POTATIONS DO SOMETIMES WAKE WINES TURNIPS RESTRAIN PASSION CAUSES
NECESSARY TO STATE
INFEST THE POOR WIDOW HER LORD'S EFFECTS WILL
BE VOID
BUT DIRT BATHING ETC ETC FOLLOWED UNFAIRLY WILL
WORM HIM FROM HIS FOLLY SO SWEAR NOT
YRXWLY HEVACE EVEELOJ
THIS WAS MORE LIKE IT
BUT I WAS UNABLE TO PROCEED
I WAS TOO MUCH
WORN
THE WORD 'TURNIPS' BROUGHT TEMPORARY JOY AND ENCOURAGEMENT BUT MY
STRENGTH WAS SO MUCH IMPAIRED AND THE DELAY MIGHT BE SO PERILOUS FOR THE
BOY THAT I RELINQUISHED THE IDEA OF PURSUING THE TRANSLATION FURTHER
AND RESOLVED TO DO WHAT I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE AT FIRST
I SAT DOWN AND
WROTE MR
GREELEY AS FOLLOWS
DEAR SIR I FEAR I DO NOT ENTIRELY COMPREHEND YOUR KIND NOTE
IT
CANNOT BE POSSIBLE SIR THAT 'TURNIPS RESTRAIN PASSION' AT LEAST
THE STUDY OR CONTEMPLATION OF TURNIPS CANNOT FOR IT IS THIS VERY
EMPLOYMENT THAT HAS SCORCHED OUR POOR FRIEND'S MIND AND SAPPED HIS
BODILY STRENGTH BUT IF THEY DO RESTRAIN IT WILL YOU BEAR WITH US
A LITTLE FURTHER AND EXPLAIN HOW THEY SHOULD BE PREPARED I OBSERVE
THAT YOU SAY 'CAUSES NECESSARY TO STATE BUT YOU HAVE OMITTED TO
STATE THEM
UNDER A MISAPPREHENSION YOU SEEM TO ATTRIBUTE TO ME INTERESTED
MOTIVES IN THIS MATTER TO CALL IT BY NO HARSHER TERM
BUT I ASSURE
YOU DEAR SIR THAT IF I SEEM TO BE 'INFESTING THE WIDOW IT IS ALL
SEEMING AND VOID OF REALITY
IT IS FROM NO SEEKING OF MINE THAT I
AM IN THIS POSITION
SHE ASKED ME HERSELF TO WRITE YOU
I NEVER
HAVE INFESTED HER INDEED I SCARCELY KNOW HER
I DO NOT INFEST
ANYBODY
I TRY TO GO ALONG IN MY HUMBLE WAY DOING AS NEAR RIGHT
AS I CAN NEVER HARMING ANYBODY AND NEVER THROWING OUT
INSINUATIONS
AS FOR 'HER LORD AND HIS EFFECTS THEY ARE OF NO
INTEREST TO ME
I TRUST I HAVE EFFECTS ENOUGH OF MY OWN SHALL
ENDEAVOR TO GET ALONG WITH THEM AT ANY RATE AND NOT GO MOUSING
AROUND TO GET HOLD OF SOMEBODY'S THAT ARE 'VOID BUT DO YOU NOT
SEE THIS WOMAN IS A WIDOW SHE HAS NO 'LORD HE IS DEAD OR
PRETENDED TO BE WHEN THEY BURIED HIM
THEREFORE NO AMOUNT OF
'DIRT BATHING ETC ETC HOWSOEVER 'UNFAIRLY FOLLOWED' WILL BE
LIKELY TO 'WORM HIM FROM HIS FOLLY' IF BEING DEAD AND A GHOST IS
'FOLLY YOUR CLOSING REMARK IS AS UNKIND AS IT WAS UNCALLED FOR
AND IF REPORT SAYS TRUE YOU MIGHT HAVE APPLIED IT TO YOURSELF SIR
WITH MORE POINT AND LESS IMPROPRIETY
VERY TRULY YOURS SIMON ERICKSON
IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS MR
GREELY DID WHAT WOULD HAVE SAVED A
WORLD OF TROUBLE AND MUCH MENTAL AND BODILY SUFFERING AND
MISUNDERSTANDING IF HE HAD DONE IT SOONER
TO WIT HE SENT AN
INTELLIGIBLE RESCRIPT OR TRANSLATION OF HIS ORIGINAL NOTE MADE IN A
PLAIN HAND BY HIS CLERK
THEN THE MYSTERY CLEARED AND I SAW THAT HIS
HEART HAD BEEN RIGHT ALL THE TIME
I WILL RECITE THE NOTE IN ITS
CLARIFIED FORM
TRANSLATION
'POTATOES DO SOMETIMES MAKE VINES TURNIPS REMAIN PASSIVE CAUSE
UNNECESSARY TO STATE
INFORM THE POOR WIDOW HER LAD'S EFFORTS WILL
BE VAIN
BUT DIET BATHING ETC
ETC FOLLOWED UNIFORMLY WILL
WEAN HIM FROM HIS FOLLY SO FEAR NOT
YOURS HORACE GREELEY
BUT ALAS IT WAS TOO LATE GENTLEMEN TOO LATE
THE CRIMINAL DELAY HAD
DONE ITS WORK YOUNG BEAZELY WAS NO MORE
HIS SPIRIT HAD TAKEN ITS
FLIGHT TO A LAND WHERE ALL ANXIETIES SHALL BE CHARMED AWAY ALL DESIRES
GRATIFIED ALL AMBITIONS REALIZED
POOR LAD THEY LAID HIM TO HIS REST
WITH A TURNIP IN EACH HAND
SO ENDED ERICKSON AND LAPSED AGAIN INTO NODDING MUMBLING AND
ABSTRACTION
THE COMPANY BROKE UP AND LEFT HIM SO
BUT THEY DID NOT
SAY WHAT DROVE HIM CRAZY
IN THE MOMENTARY CONFUSION I FORGOT TO ASK
CHAPTER LXXI
AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WE WERE WINDING DOWN A MOUNTAIN OF
DREARY AND DESOLATE LAVA TO THE SEA AND CLOSING OUR PLEASANT LAND
JOURNEY
THIS LAVA IS THE ACCUMULATION OF AGES ONE TORRENT OF FIRE
AFTER ANOTHER HAS ROLLED DOWN HERE IN OLD TIMES AND BUILT UP THE ISLAND
STRUCTURE HIGHER AND HIGHER
UNDERNEATH IT IS HONEY COMBED WITH CAVES
IT WOULD BE OF NO USE TO DIG WELLS IN SUCH A PLACE THEY WOULD NOT HOLD
WATER YOU WOULD NOT FIND ANY FOR THEM TO HOLD FOR THAT MATTER
CONSEQUENTLY THE PLANTERS DEPEND UPON CISTERNS
THE LAST LAVA FLOW OCCURRED HERE SO LONG AGO THAT THERE ARE NONE NOW
LIVING WHO WITNESSED IT
IN ONE PLACE IT ENCLOSED AND BURNED DOWN A
GROVE OF COCOA NUT TREES AND THE HOLES IN THE LAVA WHERE THE TRUNKS
STOOD ARE STILL VISIBLE THEIR SIDES RETAIN THE IMPRESSION OF THE BARK
THE TREES FELL UPON THE BURNING RIVER AND BECOMING PARTLY SUBMERGED
LEFT IN IT THE PERFECT COUNTERPART OF EVERY KNOT AND BRANCH AND LEAF
AND EVEN NUT FOR CURIOSITY SEEKERS OF A LONG DISTANT DAY TO GAZE UPON
AND WONDER AT
THERE WERE DOUBTLESS PLENTY OF KANAKA SENTINELS ON GUARD HEREABOUTS AT
THAT TIME BUT THEY DID NOT LEAVE CASTS OF THEIR FIGURES IN THE LAVA AS
THE ROMAN SENTINELS AT HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII DID
IT IS A PITY IT IS
SO BECAUSE SUCH THINGS ARE SO INTERESTING BUT SO IT IS
THEY PROBABLY
WENT AWAY
THEY WENT AWAY EARLY PERHAPS
HOWEVER THEY HAD THEIR
MERITS THE ROMANS EXHIBITED THE HIGHER PLUCK BUT THE KANAKAS SHOWED THE
SOUNDER JUDGMENT
SHORTLY WE CAME IN SIGHT OF THAT SPOT WHOSE HISTORY IS SO FAMILIAR TO
EVERY SCHOOL BOY IN THE WIDE WORLD KEALAKEKUA BAY THE PLACE WHERE
CAPTAIN COOK THE GREAT CIRCUMNAVIGATOR WAS KILLED BY THE NATIVES
NEARLY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
THE SETTING SUN WAS FLAMING UPON IT A
SUMMER SHOWER WAS FALLING AND IT WAS SPANNED BY TWO MAGNIFICENT
RAINBOWS
TWO MEN WHO WERE IN ADVANCE OF US RODE THROUGH ONE OF THESE
AND FOR A MOMENT THEIR GARMENTS SHONE WITH A MORE THAN REGAL SPLENDOR
WHY DID NOT CAPTAIN COOK HAVE TASTE ENOUGH TO CALL HIS GREAT DISCOVERY
THE RAINBOW ISLANDS THESE CHARMING SPECTACLES ARE PRESENT TO YOU AT
EVERY TURN THEY ARE COMMON IN ALL THE ISLANDS THEY ARE VISIBLE EVERY
DAY AND FREQUENTLY AT NIGHT ALSO NOT THE SILVERY BOW WE SEE ONCE IN AN
AGE IN THE STATES BY MOONLIGHT BUT BARRED WITH ALL BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL
COLORS LIKE THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN AND RAIN
I SAW ONE OF THEM A FEW
NIGHTS AGO
WHAT THE SAILORS CALL RAINDOGS LITTLE PATCHES OF RAINBOW
ARE OFTEN SEEN DRIFTING ABOUT THE HEAVENS IN THESE LATITUDES LIKE
STAINED CATHEDRAL WINDOWS
KEALAKEKUA BAY IS A LITTLE CURVE LIKE THE LAST KINK OF A SNAIL SHELL
WINDING DEEP INTO THE LAND SEEMINGLY NOT MORE THAN A MILE WIDE FROM
SHORE TO SHORE
IT IS BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE WHERE THE MURDER WAS DONE BY
A LITTLE FLAT PLAIN ON WHICH STANDS A COCOANUT GROVE AND SOME RUINED
HOUSES A STEEP WALL OF LAVA A THOUSAND FEET HIGH AT THE UPPER END AND
THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED AT THE LOWER COMES DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND
BOUNDS THE INNER EXTREMITY OF IT
FROM THIS WALL THE PLACE TAKES ITS
NAME KEALAKEKUA WHICH IN THE NATIVE TONGUE SIGNIFIES THE PATHWAY OF
THE GODS THEY SAY AND STILL BELIEVE IN SPITE OF THEIR LIBERAL
EDUCATION IN CHRISTIANITY THAT THE GREAT GOD LONO WHO USED TO LIVE
UPON THE HILLSIDE ALWAYS TRAVELED THAT CAUSEWAY WHEN URGENT BUSINESS
CONNECTED WITH HEAVENLY AFFAIRS CALLED HIM DOWN TO THE SEASHORE IN A
HURRY
AS THE RED SUN LOOKED ACROSS THE PLACID OCEAN THROUGH THE TALL CLEAN
STEMS OF THE COCOANUT TREES LIKE A BLOOMING WHISKEY BLOAT THROUGH THE
BARS OF A CITY PRISON I WENT AND STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE WATER ON THE
FLAT ROCK PRESSED BY CAPTAIN COOK'S FEET WHEN THE BLOW WAS DEALT WHICH
TOOK AWAY HIS LIFE AND TRIED TO PICTURE IN MY MIND THE DOOMED MAN
STRUGGLING IN THE MIDST OF THE MULTITUDE OF EXASPERATED SAVAGES THE MEN
IN THE SHIP CROWDING TO THE VESSEL'S SIDE AND GAZING IN ANXIOUS DISMAY
TOWARD THE SHORE THE BUT I DISCOVERED THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
IT WAS GROWING DARK THE RAIN BEGAN TO FALL WE COULD SEE THAT THE
DISTANT BOOMERANG WAS HELPLESSLY BECALMED AT SEA AND SO I ADJOURNED TO
THE CHEERLESS LITTLE BOX OF A WAREHOUSE AND SAT DOWN TO SMOKE AND THINK
AND WISH THE SHIP WOULD MAKE THE LAND FOR WE HAD NOT EATEN MUCH FOR TEN
HOURS AND WERE VICIOUSLY HUNGRY
PLAIN UNVARNISHED HISTORY TAKES THE ROMANCE OUT OF CAPTAIN COOK'S
ASSASSINATION AND RENDERS A DELIBERATE VERDICT OF JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE
WHEREVER HE WENT AMONG THE ISLANDS HE WAS CORDIALLY RECEIVED AND
WELCOMED BY THE INHABITANTS AND HIS SHIPS LAVISHLY SUPPLIED WITH ALL
MANNER OF FOOD
HE RETURNED THESE KINDNESSES WITH INSULT AND
ILL TREATMENT
PERCEIVING THAT THE PEOPLE TOOK HIM FOR THE LONG VANISHED
AND LAMENTED GOD LONO HE ENCOURAGED THEM IN THE DELUSION FOR THE SAKE OF
THE LIMITLESS POWER IT GAVE HIM BUT DURING THE FAMOUS DISTURBANCE AT
THIS SPOT AND WHILE HE AND HIS COMRADES WERE SURROUNDED BY FIFTEEN
THOUSAND MADDENED SAVAGES HE RECEIVED A HURT AND BETRAYED HIS EARTHLY
ORIGIN WITH A GROAN
IT WAS HIS DEATH WARRANT
INSTANTLY A SHOUT WENT
UP HE GROANS HE IS NOT A GOD SO THEY CLOSED IN UPON HIM AND
DISPATCHED HIM
HIS FLESH WAS STRIPPED FROM THE BONES AND BURNED EXCEPT NINE POUNDS OF
IT WHICH WERE SENT ON BOARD THE SHIPS
THE HEART WAS HUNG UP IN A
NATIVE HUT WHERE IT WAS FOUND AND EATEN BY THREE CHILDREN WHO MISTOOK
IT FOR THE HEART OF A DOG
ONE OF THESE CHILDREN GREW TO BE A VERY OLD
MAN AND DIED IN HONOLULU A FEW YEARS AGO
SOME OF COOK'S BONES WERE
RECOVERED AND CONSIGNED TO THE DEEP BY THE OFFICERS OF THE SHIPS
SMALL BLAME SHOULD ATTACH TO THE NATIVES FOR THE KILLING OF COOK
THEY TREATED HIM WELL
IN RETURN HE ABUSED THEM
HE AND HIS MEN
INFLICTED BODILY INJURY UPON MANY OF THEM AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND KILLED
AT LEAST THREE OF THEM BEFORE THEY OFFERED ANY PROPORTIONATE RETALIATION
NEAR THE SHORE WE FOUND COOK'S MONUMENT ONLY A COCOANUT STUMP FOUR
FEET HIGH AND ABOUT A FOOT IN DIAMETER AT THE BUTT
IT HAD LAVA BOULDERS
PILED AROUND ITS BASE TO HOLD IT UP AND KEEP IT IN ITS PLACE AND IT WAS
ENTIRELY SHEATHED OVER FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WITH ROUGH DISCOLORED SHEETS
OF COPPER SUCH AS SHIPS' BOTTOMS ARE COPPERED WITH
EACH SHEET HAD A
RUDE INSCRIPTION SCRATCHED UPON IT WITH A NAIL APPARENTLY AND IN EVERY
CASE THE EXECUTION WAS WRETCHED
MOST OF THESE MERELY RECORDED THE
VISITS OF BRITISH NAVAL COMMANDERS TO THE SPOT BUT ONE OF THEM BORE THIS
LEGEND
NEAR THIS SPOT FELL
CAPTAIN JAMES COOK
THE DISTINGUISHED CIRCUMNAVIGATOR
WHO DISCOVERED THESE ISLANDS
A
D
1778
AFTER COOK'S MURDER HIS SECOND IN COMMAND ON BOARD THE SHIP OPENED
FIRE UPON THE SWARMS OF NATIVES ON THE BEACH AND ONE OF HIS CANNON BALLS
CUT THIS COCOANUT TREE SHORT OFF AND LEFT THIS MONUMENTAL STUMP STANDING
IT LOOKED SAD AND LONELY ENOUGH TO US OUT THERE IN THE RAINY TWILIGHT
BUT THERE IS NO OTHER MONUMENT TO CAPTAIN COOK
TRUE UP ON THE MOUNTAIN
SIDE WE HAD PASSED BY A LARGE INCLOSURE LIKE AN AMPLE HOG PEN BUILT OF
LAVA BLOCKS WHICH MARKS THE SPOT WHERE COOK'S FLESH WAS STRIPPED FROM
HIS BONES AND BURNED BUT THIS IS NOT PROPERLY A MONUMENT SINCE IT WAS
ERECTED BY THE NATIVES THEMSELVES AND LESS TO DO HONOR TO THE
CIRCUMNAVIGATOR THAN FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE IN ROASTING HIM
A THING LIKE A GUIDE BOARD WAS ELEVATED ABOVE THIS PEN ON A TALL POLE
AND FORMERLY THERE WAS AN INSCRIPTION UPON IT DESCRIBING THE MEMORABLE
OCCURRENCE THAT HAD THERE TAKEN PLACE BUT THE SUN AND THE WIND HAVE LONG
AGO SO DEFACED IT AS TO RENDER IT ILLEGIBLE
TOWARD MIDNIGHT A FINE BREEZE SPRANG UP AND THE SCHOONER SOON WORKED
HERSELF INTO THE BAY AND CAST ANCHOR
THE BOAT CAME ASHORE FOR US AND
IN A LITTLE WHILE THE CLOUDS AND THE RAIN WERE ALL GONE
THE MOON WAS
BEAMING TRANQUILLY DOWN ON LAND AND SEA AND WE TWO WERE STRETCHED UPON
THE DECK SLEEPING THE REFRESHING SLEEP AND DREAMING THE HAPPY DREAMS THAT
ARE ONLY VOUCHSAFED TO THE WEARY AND THE INNOCENT
CHAPTER LXXII
IN THE BREEZY MORNING WE WENT ASHORE AND VISITED THE RUINED TEMPLE OF THE
LAST GOD LONO
THE HIGH CHIEF COOK OF THIS TEMPLE THE PRIEST WHO
PRESIDED OVER IT AND ROASTED THE HUMAN SACRIFICES WAS UNCLE TO OBOOKIA
AND AT ONE TIME THAT YOUTH WAS AN APPRENTICE PRIEST UNDER HIM
OBOOKIA
WAS A YOUNG NATIVE OF FINE MIND WHO TOGETHER WITH THREE OTHER NATIVE
BOYS WAS TAKEN TO NEW ENGLAND BY THE CAPTAIN OF A WHALESHIP DURING THE
REIGN OF KAMEHAMEHA I AND THEY WERE THE MEANS OF ATTRACTING THE
ATTENTION OF THE RELIGIOUS WORLD TO THEIR COUNTRY
THIS RESULTED IN THE
SENDING OF MISSIONARIES THERE
AND THIS OBOOKIA WAS THE VERY SAME
SENSITIVE SAVAGE WHO SAT DOWN ON THE CHURCH STEPS AND WEPT BECAUSE HIS
PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE THE BIBLE
THAT INCIDENT HAS BEEN VERY ELABORATELY
PAINTED IN MANY A CHARMING SUNDAY SCHOOL BOOK AYE AND TOLD SO
PLAINTIVELY AND SO TENDERLY THAT I HAVE CRIED OVER IT IN SUNDAY SCHOOL
MYSELF ON GENERAL PRINCIPLES ALTHOUGH AT A TIME WHEN I DID NOT KNOW
MUCH AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE PEOPLE OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS
NEEDED TO WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT IT AS LONG AS THEY DID NOT KNOW THERE WAS A
BIBLE AT ALL
OBOOKIA WAS CONVERTED AND EDUCATED AND WAS TO HAVE RETURNED TO HIS
NATIVE LAND WITH THE FIRST MISSIONARIES HAD HE LIVED
THE OTHER NATIVE
YOUTHS MADE THE VOYAGE AND TWO OF THEM DID GOOD SERVICE BUT THE THIRD
WILLIAM KANUI FELL FROM GRACE AFTERWARD FOR A TIME AND WHEN THE GOLD
EXCITEMENT BROKE OUT IN CALIFORNIA HE JOURNEYED THITHER AND WENT TO
MINING ALTHOUGH HE WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD
HE SUCCEEDED PRETTY WELL BUT
THE FAILURE OF PAGE BACON CO
RELIEVED HIM OF SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND THEN TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HE WAS A BANKRUPT IN HIS OLD AGE
AND HE RESUMED SERVICE IN THE PULPIT AGAIN
HE DIED IN HONOLULU IN 1864
QUITE A BROAD TRACT OF LAND NEAR THE TEMPLE EXTENDING FROM THE SEA TO
THE MOUNTAIN TOP WAS SACRED TO THE GOD LONO IN OLDEN TIMES SO SACRED
THAT IF A COMMON NATIVE SET HIS SACRILEGIOUS FOOT UPON IT IT WAS
JUDICIOUS FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS WILL BECAUSE HIS TIME HAD COME
HE MIGHT
GO AROUND IT BY WATER BUT HE COULD NOT CROSS IT
IT WAS WELL SPRINKLED
WITH PAGAN TEMPLES AND STOCKED WITH AWKWARD HOMELY IDOLS CARVED OUT OF
LOGS OF WOOD
THERE WAS A TEMPLE DEVOTED TO PRAYERS FOR RAIN AND WITH
FINE SAGACITY IT WAS PLACED AT A POINT SO WELL UP ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
THAT IF YOU PRAYED THERE TWENTY FOUR TIMES A DAY FOR RAIN YOU WOULD BE
LIKELY TO GET IT EVERY TIME
YOU WOULD SELDOM GET TO YOUR AMEN BEFORE
YOU WOULD HAVE TO HOIST YOUR UMBRELLA
AND THERE WAS A LARGE TEMPLE NEAR AT HAND WHICH WAS BUILT IN A SINGLE
NIGHT IN THE MIDST OF STORM AND THUNDER AND RAIN BY THE GHASTLY HANDS
OF DEAD MEN TRADITION SAYS THAT BY THE WEIRD GLARE OF THE LIGHTNING A
NOISELESS MULTITUDE OF PHANTOMS WERE SEEN AT THEIR STRANGE LABOR FAR UP
THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AT DEAD OF NIGHT FLITTING HITHER AND THITHER AND
BEARING GREAT LAVA BLOCKS CLASPED IN THEIR NERVELESS FINGERS APPEARING
AND DISAPPEARING AS THE PALLID LUSTRE FELL UPON THEIR FORMS AND FADED
AWAY AGAIN
EVEN TO THIS DAY IT IS SAID THE NATIVES HOLD THIS DREAD
STRUCTURE IN AWE AND REVERENCE AND WILL NOT PASS BY IT IN THE NIGHT
AT NOON I OBSERVED A BEVY OF NUDE NATIVE YOUNG LADIES BATHING IN THE SEA
AND WENT AND SAT DOWN ON THEIR CLOTHES TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING STOLEN
I BEGGED THEM TO COME OUT FOR THE SEA WAS RISING AND I WAS SATISFIED
THAT THEY WERE RUNNING SOME RISK
BUT THEY WERE NOT AFRAID AND
PRESENTLY WENT ON WITH THEIR SPORT
THEY WERE FINISHED SWIMMERS AND
DIVERS AND ENJOYED THEMSELVES TO THE LAST DEGREE
THEY SWAM RACES SPLASHED AND DUCKED AND TUMBLED EACH OTHER ABOUT AND
FILLED THE AIR WITH THEIR LAUGHTER
IT IS SAID THAT THE FIRST THING AN
ISLANDER LEARNS IS HOW TO SWIM LEARNING TO WALK BEING A MATTER OF
SMALLER CONSEQUENCE COMES AFTERWARD
ONE HEARS TALES OF NATIVE MEN AND
WOMEN SWIMMING ASHORE FROM VESSELS MANY MILES AT SEA MORE MILES INDEED
THAN I DARE VOUCH FOR OR EVEN MENTION
AND THEY TELL OF A NATIVE DIVER
WHO WENT DOWN IN THIRTY OR FORTY FOOT WATERS AND BROUGHT UP AN ANVIL
I THINK HE SWALLOWED THE ANVIL AFTERWARD IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME
HOWEVER I WILL NOT URGE THIS POINT
I HAVE SPOKEN SEVERAL TIMES OF THE GOD LONO I MAY AS WELL FURNISH TWO
OR THREE SENTENCES CONCERNING HIM
THE IDOL THE NATIVES WORSHIPPED FOR HIM WAS A SLENDER UNORNAMENTED STAFF
TWELVE FEET LONG
TRADITION SAYS HE WAS A FAVORITE GOD ON THE ISLAND OF
HAWAII A GREAT KING WHO HAD BEEN DEIFIED FOR MERITORIOUS SERVICES JUST
OUR OWN FASHION OF REWARDING HEROES WITH THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE WOULD
HAVE MADE HIM A POSTMASTER INSTEAD OF A GOD NO DOUBT
IN AN ANGRY
MOMENT HE SLEW HIS WIFE A GODDESS NAMED KAIKILANI AIII
REMORSE OF
CONSCIENCE DROVE HIM MAD AND TRADITION PRESENTS US THE SINGULAR
SPECTACLE OF A GOD TRAVELING ON THE SHOULDER FOR IN HIS GNAWING GRIEF
HE WANDERED ABOUT FROM PLACE TO PLACE BOXING AND WRESTLING WITH ALL WHOM
HE MET
OF COURSE THIS PASTIME SOON LOST ITS NOVELTY INASMUCH AS IT
MUST NECESSARILY HAVE BEEN THE CASE THAT WHEN SO POWERFUL A DEITY SENT A
FRAIL HUMAN OPPONENT TO GRASS HE NEVER CAME BACK ANY MORE
THEREFORE
HE INSTITUTED GAMES CALLED MAKAHIKI AND ORDERED THAT THEY SHOULD BE HELD
IN HIS HONOR AND THEN SAILED FOR FOREIGN LANDS ON A THREE CORNERED RAFT
STATING THAT HE WOULD RETURN SOME DAY AND THAT WAS THE LAST OF LONO
HE WAS NEVER SEEN ANY MORE HIS RAFT GOT SWAMPED PERHAPS
BUT THE
PEOPLE ALWAYS EXPECTED HIS RETURN AND THUS THEY WERE EASILY LED TO
ACCEPT CAPTAIN COOK AS THE RESTORED GOD
SOME OF THE OLD NATIVES BELIEVED COOK WAS LONO TO THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH
BUT MANY DID NOT FOR THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD DIE IF HE
WAS A GOD
ONLY A MILE OR SO FROM KEALAKEKUA BAY IS A SPOT OF HISTORIC INTEREST THE
PLACE WHERE THE LAST BATTLE WAS FOUGHT FOR IDOLATRY
OF COURSE WE
VISITED IT AND CAME AWAY AS WISE AS MOST PEOPLE DO WHO GO AND GAZE UPON
SUCH MEMENTOES OF THE PAST WHEN IN AN UNREFLECTIVE MOOD
WHILE THE FIRST MISSIONARIES WERE ON THEIR WAY AROUND THE HORN THE
IDOLATROUS CUSTOMS WHICH HAD OBTAINED IN THE ISLAND AS FAR BACK AS
TRADITION REACHED WERE SUDDENLY BROKEN UP
OLD KAMEHAMEHA I WAS DEAD
AND HIS SON LIHOLIHO THE NEW KING WAS A FREE LIVER A ROYSTERING
DISSOLUTE FELLOW AND HATED THE RESTRAINTS OF THE ANCIENT TABU
HIS
ASSISTANT IN THE GOVERNMENT KAAHUMANU THE QUEEN DOWAGER WAS PROUD AND
HIGH SPIRITED AND HATED THE TABU BECAUSE IT RESTRICTED THE PRIVILEGES OF
HER SEX AND DEGRADED ALL WOMEN VERY NEARLY TO THE LEVEL OF BRUTES
SO THE CASE STOOD
LIHOLIHO HAD HALF A MIND TO PUT HIS FOOT DOWN
KAAHUMAHU HAD A WHOLE MIND TO BADGER HIM INTO DOING IT AND WHISKEY DID
THE REST
IT WAS PROBABLY THE REST
IT WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME
WHISKEY EVER PROMINENTLY FIGURED AS AN AID TO CIVILIZATION
LIHOLIHO
CAME UP TO KAILUA AS DRUNK AS A PIPER AND ATTENDED A GREAT FEAST THE
DETERMINED QUEEN SPURRED HIS DRUNKEN COURAGE UP TO A RECKLESS PITCH AND
THEN WHILE ALL THE MULTITUDE STARED IN BLANK DISMAY HE MOVED
DELIBERATELY FORWARD AND SAT DOWN WITH THE WOMEN
THEY SAW HIM EAT FROM THE SAME VESSEL WITH THEM AND WERE APPALLED
TERRIBLE MOMENTS DRIFTED SLOWLY BY AND STILL THE KING ATE STILL HE
LIVED STILL THE LIGHTNINGS OF THE INSULTED GODS WERE WITHHELD
THEN CONVICTION CAME LIKE A REVELATION THE SUPERSTITIONS OF A HUNDRED
GENERATIONS PASSED FROM BEFORE THE PEOPLE LIKE A CLOUD AND A SHOUT WENT
UP THE TABU IS BROKEN THE TABU IS BROKEN
THUS DID KING LIHOLIHO AND HIS DREADFUL WHISKEY PREACH THE FIRST SERMON
AND PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE NEW GOSPEL THAT WAS SPEEDING SOUTHWARD OVER
THE WAVES OF THE ATLANTIC
THE TABU BROKEN AND DESTRUCTION FAILING TO FOLLOW THE AWFUL SACRILEGE
THE PEOPLE WITH THAT CHILDLIKE PRECIPITANCY WHICH HAS ALWAYS
CHARACTERIZED THEM JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEIR GODS WERE A WEAK
AND WRETCHED SWINDLE JUST AS THEY FORMERLY JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
CAPTAIN COOK WAS NO GOD MERELY BECAUSE HE GROANED AND PROMPTLY KILLED
HIM WITHOUT STOPPING TO INQUIRE WHETHER A GOD MIGHT NOT GROAN AS WELL AS
A MAN IF IT SUITED HIS CONVENIENCE TO DO IT AND SATISFIED THAT THE IDOLS
WERE POWERLESS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES THEY WENT TO WORK AT ONCE AND PULLED
THEM DOWN HACKED THEM TO PIECES APPLIED THE TORCH ANNIHILATED THEM
THE PAGAN PRIESTS WERE FURIOUS
AND WELL THEY MIGHT BE THEY HAD HELD
THE FATTEST OFFICES IN THE LAND AND NOW THEY WERE BEGGARED THEY HAD
BEEN GREAT THEY HAD STOOD ABOVE THE CHIEFS AND NOW THEY WERE VAGABONDS
THEY RAISED A REVOLT THEY SCARED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE INTO JOINING THEIR
STANDARD AND BEKUOKALANI AN AMBITIOUS OFFSHOOT OF ROYALTY WAS EASILY
PERSUADED TO BECOME THEIR LEADER
IN THE FIRST SKIRMISH THE IDOLATERS TRIUMPHED OVER THE ROYAL ARMY SENT
AGAINST THEM AND FULL OF CONFIDENCE THEY RESOLVED TO MARCH UPON KAILUA
THE KING SENT AN ENVOY TO TRY AND CONCILIATE THEM AND CAME VERY NEAR
BEING AN ENVOY SHORT BY THE OPERATION THE SAVAGES NOT ONLY REFUSED TO
LISTEN TO HIM BUT WANTED TO KILL HIM
SO THE KING SENT HIS MEN FORTH
UNDER MAJOR GENERAL KALAIMOKU AND THE TWO HOST MET A KUAMOO
THE BATTLE
WAS LONG AND FIERCE MEN AND WOMEN FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE AS WAS THE
CUSTOM AND WHEN THE DAY WAS DONE THE REBELS WERE FLYING IN EVERY
DIRECTION IN HOPELESS PANIC AND IDOLATRY AND THE TABU WERE DEAD IN THE
LAND
THE ROYALISTS MARCHED GAYLY HOME TO KAILUA GLORIFYING THE NEW
DISPENSATION
THERE IS NO POWER IN THE GODS SAID THEY THEY ARE A
VANITY AND A LIE
THE ARMY WITH IDOLS WAS WEAK THE ARMY WITHOUT IDOLS
WAS STRONG AND VICTORIOUS
THE NATION WAS WITHOUT A RELIGION
THE MISSIONARY SHIP ARRIVED IN SAFETY SHORTLY AFTERWARD TIMED BY
PROVIDENTIAL EXACTNESS TO MEET THE EMERGENCY AND THE GOSPEL WAS PLANTED
AS IN A VIRGIN SOIL
CHAPTER LXXIII
AT NOON WE HIRED A KANAKA TO TAKE US DOWN TO THE ANCIENT RUINS AT
HONAUNAN IN HIS CANOE PRICE TWO DOLLARS REASONABLE ENOUGH FOR A SEA
VOYAGE OF EIGHT MILES COUNTING BOTH WAYS
THE NATIVE CANOE IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE LOOKING CONTRIVANCE
I CANNOT THINK
OF ANYTHING TO LIKEN IT TO BUT A BOY'S SLED RUNNER HOLLOWED OUT AND THAT
DOES NOT QUITE CONVEY THE CORRECT IDEA
IT IS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET LONG
HIGH AND POINTED AT BOTH ENDS IS A FOOT AND A HALF OR TWO FEET DEEP AND
SO NARROW THAT IF YOU WEDGED A FAT MAN INTO IT YOU MIGHT NOT GET HIM OUT
AGAIN
IT SITS ON TOP OF THE WATER LIKE A DUCK BUT IT HAS AN OUTRIGGER
AND DOES NOT UPSET EASILY IF YOU KEEP STILL
THIS OUTRIGGER IS FORMED
OF TWO LONG BENT STICKS LIKE PLOW HANDLES WHICH PROJECT FROM ONE SIDE
AND TO THEIR OUTER ENDS IS BOUND A CURVED BEAM COMPOSED OF AN EXTREMELY
LIGHT WOOD WHICH SKIMS ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND THUS SAVES YOU
FROM AN UPSET ON THAT SIDE WHILE THE OUTRIGGER'S WEIGHT IS NOT SO EASILY
LIFTED AS TO MAKE AN UPSET ON THE OTHER SIDE A THING TO BE GREATLY
FEARED
STILL UNTIL ONE GETS USED TO SITTING PERCHED UPON THIS
KNIFEBLADE HE IS APT TO REASON WITHIN HIMSELF THAT IT WOULD BE MORE
COMFORTABLE IF THERE WERE JUST AN OUTRIGGER OR SO ON THE OTHER SIDE ALSO
I HAD THE BOW SEAT AND BILLINGS SAT AMIDSHIPS AND FACED THE KANAKA WHO
OCCUPIED THE STERN OF THE CRAFT AND DID THE PADDLING
WITH THE FIRST
STROKE THE TRIM SHELL OF A THING SHOT OUT FROM THE SHORE LIKE AN ARROW
THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO SEE
WHILE WE WERE ON THE SHALLOW WATER OF THE
REEF IT WAS PASTIME TO LOOK DOWN INTO THE LIMPID DEPTHS AT THE LARGE
BUNCHES OF BRANCHING CORAL THE UNIQUE SHRUBBERY OF THE SEA
WE LOST
THAT THOUGH WHEN WE GOT OUT INTO THE DEAD BLUE WATER OF THE DEEP
BUT WE HAD THE PICTURE OF THE SURF THEN DASHING ANGRILY AGAINST THE
CRAG BOUND SHORE AND SENDING A FOAMING SPRAY HIGH INTO THE AIR
THERE WAS INTEREST IN THIS BEETLING BORDER TOO FOR IT WAS HONEY COMBED
WITH QUAINT CAVES AND ARCHES AND TUNNELS AND HAD A RUDE SEMBLANCE OF THE
DILAPIDATED ARCHITECTURE OF RUINED KEEPS AND CASTLES RISING OUT OF THE
RESTLESS SEA
WHEN THIS NOVELTY CEASED TO BE A NOVELTY WE TURNED OUR
EYES SHOREWARD AND GAZED AT THE LONG MOUNTAIN WITH ITS RICH GREEN FORESTS
STRETCHING UP INTO THE CURTAINING CLOUDS AND AT THE SPECKS OF HOUSES IN
THE REARWARD DISTANCE AND THE DIMINISHED SCHOONER RIDING SLEEPILY AT
ANCHOR
AND WHEN THESE GREW TIRESOME WE DASHED BOLDLY INTO THE MIDST OF
A SCHOOL OF HUGE BEASTLY PORPOISES ENGAGED AT THEIR ETERNAL GAME OF
ARCHING OVER A WAVE AND DISAPPEARING AND THEN DOING IT OVER AGAIN AND
KEEPING IT UP ALWAYS CIRCLING OVER IN THAT WAY LIKE SO MANY
WELL SUBMERGED WHEELS
BUT THE PORPOISES WHEELED THEMSELVES AWAY AND
THEN WE WERE THROWN UPON OUR OWN RESOURCES
IT DID NOT TAKE MANY MINUTES
TO DISCOVER THAT THE SUN WAS BLAZING LIKE A BONFIRE AND THAT THE WEATHER
WAS OF A MELTING TEMPERATURE
IT HAD A DROWSING EFFECT TOO
IN ONE
PLACE WE CAME UPON A LARGE COMPANY OF NAKED NATIVES OF BOTH SEXES AND
ALL AGES AMUSING THEMSELVES WITH THE NATIONAL PASTIME OF SURF BATHING
EACH HEATHEN WOULD PADDLE THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YARDS OUT TO SEA TAKING
A SHORT BOARD WITH HIM THEN FACE THE SHORE AND WAIT FOR A PARTICULARLY
PRODIGIOUS BILLOW TO COME ALONG AT THE RIGHT MOMENT HE WOULD FLING HIS
BOARD UPON ITS FOAMY CREST AND HIMSELF UPON THE BOARD AND HERE HE WOULD
COME WHIZZING BY LIKE A BOMBSHELL IT DID NOT SEEM THAT A LIGHTNING
EXPRESS TRAIN COULD SHOOT ALONG AT A MORE HAIR LIFTING SPEED
I TRIED
SURF BATHING ONCE SUBSEQUENTLY BUT MADE A FAILURE OF IT
I GOT THE
BOARD PLACED RIGHT AND AT THE RIGHT MOMENT TOO BUT MISSED THE
CONNECTION MYSELF THE BOARD STRUCK THE SHORE IN THREE QUARTERS OF A
SECOND WITHOUT ANY CARGO AND I STRUCK THE BOTTOM ABOUT THE SAME TIME
WITH A COUPLE OF BARRELS OF WATER IN ME
NONE BUT NATIVES EVER MASTER
THE ART OF SURF BATHING THOROUGHLY
AT THE END OF AN HOUR WE HAD MADE THE FOUR MILES AND LANDED ON A LEVEL
POINT OF LAND UPON WHICH WAS A WIDE EXTENT OF OLD RUINS WITH MANY A
TALL COCOANUT TREE GROWING AMONG THEM
HERE WAS THE ANCIENT CITY OF
REFUGE A VAST INCLOSURE WHOSE STONE WALLS WERE TWENTY FEET THICK AT THE
BASE AND FIFTEEN FEET HIGH AN OBLONG SQUARE A THOUSAND AND FORTY FEET
ONE WAY AND A FRACTION UNDER SEVEN HUNDRED THE OTHER
WITHIN THIS
INCLOSURE IN EARLY TIMES HAS BEEN THREE RUDE TEMPLES EACH TWO HUNDRED
AND TEN FEET LONG BY ONE HUNDRED WIDE AND THIRTEEN HIGH
IN THOSE DAYS IF A MAN KILLED ANOTHER ANYWHERE ON THE ISLAND THE
RELATIVES WERE PRIVILEGED TO TAKE THE MURDERER'S LIFE AND THEN A CHASE
FOR LIFE AND LIBERTY BEGAN THE OUTLAWED CRIMINAL FLYING THROUGH PATHLESS
FORESTS AND OVER MOUNTAIN AND PLAIN WITH HIS HOPES FIXED UPON THE
PROTECTING WALLS OF THE CITY OF REFUGE AND THE AVENGER OF BLOOD
FOLLOWING HOTLY AFTER HIM
SOMETIMES THE RACE WAS KEPT UP TO THE VERY GATES OF THE TEMPLE AND THE
PANTING PAIR SPED THROUGH LONG FILES OF EXCITED NATIVES WHO WATCHED THE
CONTEST WITH FLASHING EYE AND DILATED NOSTRIL ENCOURAGING THE HUNTED
REFUGEE WITH SHARP INSPIRITING EJACULATIONS AND SENDING UP A RINGING
SHOUT OF EXULTATION WHEN THE SAVING GATES CLOSED UPON HIM AND THE CHEATED
PURSUER SANK EXHAUSTED AT THE THRESHOLD
BUT SOMETIMES THE FLYING
CRIMINAL FELL UNDER THE HAND OF THE AVENGER AT THE VERY DOOR WHEN ONE
MORE BRAVE STRIDE ONE MORE BRIEF SECOND OF TIME WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIS
FEET UPON THE SACRED GROUND AND BARRED HIM AGAINST ALL HARM
WHERE DID
THESE ISOLATED PAGANS GET THIS IDEA OF A CITY OF REFUGE THIS ANCIENT
ORIENTAL CUSTOM
THIS OLD SANCTUARY WAS SACRED TO ALL EVEN TO REBELS IN ARMS AND INVADING
ARMIES
ONCE WITHIN ITS WALLS AND CONFESSION MADE TO THE PRIEST AND
ABSOLUTION OBTAINED THE WRETCH WITH A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD COULD GO FORTH
WITHOUT FEAR AND WITHOUT DANGER HE WAS TABU AND TO HARM HIM WAS DEATH
THE ROUTED REBELS IN THE LOST BATTLE FOR IDOLATRY FLED TO THIS PLACE TO
CLAIM SANCTUARY AND MANY WERE THUS SAVED
CLOSE TO THE CORNER OF THE GREAT INCLOSURE IS A ROUND STRUCTURE OF STONE
SOME SIX OR EIGHT FEET HIGH WITH A LEVEL TOP ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE IN
DIAMETER
THIS WAS THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
A HIGH PALISADE OF COCOANUT
PILES SHUT OUT THE CRUEL SCENES FROM THE VULGAR MULTITUDE
HERE
CRIMINALS WERE KILLED THE FLESH STRIPPED FROM THE BONES AND BURNED AND
THE BONES SECRETED IN HOLES IN THE BODY OF THE STRUCTURE
IF THE MAN HAD
BEEN GUILTY OF A HIGH CRIME THE ENTIRE CORPSE WAS BURNED
THE WALLS OF THE TEMPLE ARE A STUDY
THE SAME FOOD FOR SPECULATION THAT
IS OFFERED THE VISITOR TO THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT HE WILL FIND HERE THE
MYSTERY OF HOW THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED BY A PEOPLE UNACQUAINTED WITH
SCIENCE AND MECHANICS
THE NATIVES HAVE NO INVENTION OF THEIR OWN FOR
HOISTING HEAVY WEIGHTS THEY HAD NO BEASTS OF BURDEN AND THEY HAVE NEVER
EVEN SHOWN ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE LEVER
YET SOME OF THE
LAVA BLOCKS QUARRIED OUT BROUGHT OVER ROUGH BROKEN GROUND AND BUILT
INTO THIS WALL SIX OR SEVEN FEET FROM THE GROUND ARE OF PRODIGIOUS SIZE
AND WOULD WEIGH TONS
HOW DID THEY TRANSPORT AND HOW RAISE THEM
BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER SURFACES OF THE WALLS PRESENT A SMOOTH FRONT AND
ARE VERY CREDITABLE SPECIMENS OF MASONRY
THE BLOCKS ARE OF ALL MANNER
OF SHAPES AND SIZES BUT YET ARE FITTED TOGETHER WITH THE NEATEST
EXACTNESS
THE GRADUAL NARROWING OF THE WALL FROM THE BASE UPWARD IS
ACCURATELY PRESERVED
NO CEMENT WAS USED BUT THE EDIFICE IS FIRM AND COMPACT AND IS CAPABLE OF
RESISTING STORM AND DECAY FOR CENTURIES
WHO BUILT THIS TEMPLE AND HOW
WAS IT BUILT AND WHEN ARE MYSTERIES THAT MAY NEVER BE UNRAVELED
OUTSIDE OF THESE ANCIENT WALLS LIES A SORT OF COFFIN SHAPED STONE ELEVEN
FEET FOUR INCHES LONG AND THREE FEET SQUARE AT THE SMALL END IT WOULD
WEIGH A FEW THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH THE HIGH CHIEF WHO HELD SWAY OVER
THIS DISTRICT MANY CENTURIES AGO BROUGHT THITHER ON HIS SHOULDER ONE DAY
TO USE AS A LOUNGE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS ESTABLISHED BY THE MOST
RELIABLE TRADITIONS
HE USED TO LIE DOWN ON IT IN HIS INDOLENT WAY AND
KEEP AN EYE ON HIS SUBJECTS AT WORK FOR HIM AND SEE THAT THERE WAS NO
SOLDIERING DONE
AND NO DOUBT THERE WAS NOT ANY DONE TO SPEAK OF
BECAUSE HE WAS A MAN OF THAT SORT OF BUILD THAT INCITES TO ATTENTION TO
BUSINESS ON THE PART OF AN EMPLOYEE
HE WAS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN FEET HIGH
WHEN HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT FULL
LENGTH ON HIS LOUNGE HIS LEGS HUNG DOWN OVER THE END AND WHEN HE SNORED
HE WOKE THE DEAD
THESE FACTS ARE ALL ATTESTED BY IRREFRAGABLE
TRADITION
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TEMPLE IS A MONSTROUS SEVEN TON ROCK ELEVEN
FEET LONG SEVEN FEET WIDE AND THREE FEET THICK
IT IS RAISED A FOOT OR
A FOOT AND A HALF ABOVE THE GROUND AND RESTS UPON HALF A DOZEN LITTLE
STONY PEDESTALS
THE SAME OLD FOURTEEN FOOTER BROUGHT IT DOWN FROM THE
MOUNTAIN MERELY FOR FUN HE HAD HIS OWN NOTIONS ABOUT FUN AND PROPPED
IT UP AS WE FIND IT NOW AND AS OTHERS MAY FIND IT A CENTURY HENCE FOR IT
WOULD TAKE A SCORE OF HORSES TO BUDGE IT FROM ITS POSITION
THEY SAY
THAT FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS AGO THE PROUD QUEEN KAAHUMANU USED TO FLY TO
THIS ROCK FOR SAFETY WHENEVER SHE HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE WITH HER
FIERCE HUSBAND AND HIDE UNDER IT UNTIL HIS WRATH WAS APPEASED
BUT
THESE KANAKAS WILL LIE AND THIS STATEMENT IS ONE OF THEIR ABLEST
EFFORTS FOR KAAHUMANU WAS SIX FEET HIGH SHE WAS BULKY SHE WAS BUILT
LIKE AN OX AND SHE COULD NO MORE HAVE SQUEEZED HERSELF UNDER THAT ROCK
THAN SHE COULD HAVE PASSED BETWEEN THE CYLINDERS OF A SUGAR MILL
WHAT
COULD SHE GAIN BY IT EVEN IF SHE SUCCEEDED TO BE CHASED AND ABUSED BY
A SAVAGE HUSBAND COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE THAN HUMILIATING TO HER HIGH
SPIRIT YET IT COULD NEVER MAKE HER FEEL SO FLAT AS AN HOUR'S REPOSE
UNDER THAT ROCK WOULD
WE WALKED A MILE OVER A RAISED MACADAMIZED ROAD OF UNIFORM WIDTH A ROAD
PAVED WITH FLAT STONES AND EXHIBITING IN ITS EVERY DETAIL A CONSIDERABLE
DEGREE OF ENGINEERING SKILL
SOME SAY THAT THAT WISE OLD PAGAN
KAMEHAMEHA I PLANNED AND BUILT IT BUT OTHERS SAY IT WAS BUILT SO LONG
BEFORE HIS TIME THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHO CONSTRUCTED IT HAS PASSED OUT
OF THE TRADITIONS
IN EITHER CASE HOWEVER AS THE HANDIWORK OF AN
UNTAUGHT AND DEGRADED RACE IT IS A THING OF PLEASING INTEREST
THE
STONES ARE WORN AND SMOOTH AND PUSHED APART IN PLACES SO THAT THE ROAD
HAS THE EXACT APPEARANCE OF THOSE ANCIENT PAVED HIGHWAYS LEADING OUT OF
ROME WHICH ONE SEES IN PICTURES
THE OBJECT OF OUR TRAMP WAS TO VISIT A GREAT NATURAL CURIOSITY AT THE
BASE OF THE FOOTHILLS A CONGEALED CASCADE OF LAVA
SOME OLD FORGOTTEN
VOLCANIC ERUPTION SENT ITS BROAD RIVER OF FIRE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE
HERE AND IT POURED DOWN IN A GREAT TORRENT FROM AN OVERHANGING BLUFF
SOME FIFTY FEET HIGH TO THE GROUND BELOW
THE FLAMING TORRENT COOLED IN
THE WINDS FROM THE SEA AND REMAINS THERE TO DAY ALL SEAMED AND FROTHED
AND RIPPLED A PETRIFIED NIAGARA
IT IS VERY PICTURESQUE AND WITHAL SO
NATURAL THAT ONE MIGHT ALMOST IMAGINE IT STILL FLOWED
A SMALLER STREAM
TRICKLED OVER THE CLIFF AND BUILT UP AN ISOLATED PYRAMID ABOUT THIRTY
FEET HIGH WHICH HAS THE SEMBLANCE OF A MASS OF LARGE GNARLED AND KNOTTED
VINES AND ROOTS AND STEMS INTRICATELY TWISTED AND WOVEN TOGETHER
WE PASSED IN BEHIND THE CASCADE AND THE PYRAMID AND FOUND THE BLUFF
PIERCED BY SEVERAL CAVERNOUS TUNNELS WHOSE CROOKED COURSES WE FOLLOWED A
LONG DISTANCE
TWO OF THESE WINDING TUNNELS STAND AS PROOF OF NATURE'S MINING ABILITIES
THEIR FLOORS ARE LEVEL THEY ARE SEVEN FEET WIDE AND THEIR ROOFS ARE
GENTLY ARCHED
THEIR HEIGHT IS NOT UNIFORM HOWEVER
WE PASSED THROUGH
ONE A HUNDRED FEET LONG WHICH LEADS THROUGH A SPUR OF THE HILL AND OPENS
OUT WELL UP IN THE SHEER WALL OF A PRECIPICE WHOSE FOOT RESTS IN THE
WAVES OF THE SEA
IT IS A COMMODIOUS TUNNEL EXCEPT THAT THERE ARE
OCCASIONAL PLACES IN IT WHERE ONE MUST STOOP TO PASS UNDER
THE ROOF IS
LAVA OF COURSE AND IS THICKLY STUDDED WITH LITTLE LAVA POINTED ICICLES
AN INCH LONG WHICH HARDENED AS THEY DRIPPED
THEY PROJECT AS CLOSELY
TOGETHER AS THE IRON TEETH OF A CORN SHELLER AND IF ONE WILL STAND UP
STRAIGHT AND WALK ANY DISTANCE THERE HE CAN GET HIS HAIR COMBED FREE OF
CHARGE
CHAPTER LXXIV
WE GOT BACK TO THE SCHOONER IN GOOD TIME AND THEN SAILED DOWN TO KAU
WHERE WE DISEMBARKED AND TOOK FINAL LEAVE OF THE VESSEL
NEXT DAY WE
BOUGHT HORSES AND BENT OUR WAY OVER THE SUMMER CLAD MOUNTAIN TERRACES
TOWARD THE GREAT VOLCANO OF KILAUEA KE LOW WAY AH
WE MADE NEARLY A
TWO DAYS' JOURNEY OF IT BUT THAT WAS ON ACCOUNT OF LAZINESS
TOWARD
SUNSET ON THE SECOND DAY WE REACHED AN ELEVATION OF SOME FOUR THOUSAND
FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL AND AS WE PICKED OUR CAREFUL WAY THROUGH BILLOWY
WASTES OF LAVA LONG GENERATIONS AGO STRICKEN DEAD AND COLD IN THE CLIMAX
OF ITS TOSSING FURY WE BEGAN TO COME UPON SIGNS OF THE NEAR PRESENCE OF
THE VOLCANO SIGNS IN THE NATURE OF RAGGED FISSURES THAT DISCHARGED JETS
OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR INTO THE AIR HOT FROM THE MOLTEN OCEAN DOWN IN THE
BOWELS OF THE MOUNTAIN
SHORTLY THE CRATER CAME INTO VIEW
I HAVE SEEN VESUVIUS SINCE BUT IT
WAS A MERE TOY A CHILD'S VOLCANO A SOUP KETTLE COMPARED TO THIS
MOUNT VESUVIUS IS A SHAPELY CONE THIRTY SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH ITS CRATER
AN INVERTED CONE ONLY THREE HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND NOT MORE THAN A
THOUSAND FEET IN DIAMETER IF AS MUCH AS THAT ITS FIRES MEAGRE MODEST
AND DOCILE BUT HERE WAS A VAST PERPENDICULAR WALLED CELLAR NINE
HUNDRED FEET DEEP IN SOME PLACES THIRTEEN HUNDRED IN OTHERS
LEVEL FLOORED AND TEN MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE HERE WAS A YAWNING PIT
UPON WHOSE FLOOR THE ARMIES OF RUSSIA COULD CAMP AND HAVE ROOM TO SPARE
PERCHED UPON THE EDGE OF THE CRATER AT THE OPPOSITE END FROM WHERE WE
STOOD WAS A SMALL LOOK OUT HOUSE SAY THREE MILES AWAY
IT ASSISTED US
BY COMPARISON TO COMPREHEND AND APPRECIATE THE GREAT DEPTH OF THE BASIN
IT LOOKED LIKE A TINY MARTIN BOX CLINGING AT THE EAVES OF A CATHEDRAL
AFTER SOME LITTLE TIME SPENT IN RESTING AND LOOKING AND CIPHERING WE
HURRIED ON TO THE HOTEL
BY THE PATH IT IS HALF A MILE FROM THE VOLCANO HOUSE TO THE
LOOKOUT HOUSE
AFTER A HEARTY SUPPER WE WAITED UNTIL IT WAS THOROUGHLY
DARK AND THEN STARTED TO THE CRATER
THE FIRST GLANCE IN THAT DIRECTION
REVEALED A SCENE OF WILD BEAUTY
THERE WAS A HEAVY FOG OVER THE CRATER
AND IT WAS SPLENDIDLY ILLUMINATED BY THE GLARE FROM THE FIRES BELOW
THE
ILLUMINATION WAS TWO MILES WIDE AND A MILE HIGH PERHAPS AND IF YOU
EVER ON A DARK NIGHT AND AT A DISTANCE BEHELD THE LIGHT FROM THIRTY OR
FORTY BLOCKS OF DISTANT BUILDINGS ALL ON FIRE AT ONCE REFLECTED STRONGLY
AGAINST OVER HANGING CLOUDS YOU CAN FORM A FAIR IDEA OF WHAT THIS LOOKED
LIKE
A COLOSSAL COLUMN OF CLOUD TOWERED TO A GREAT HEIGHT IN THE AIR
IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE CRATER AND THE OUTER SWELL OF EVERY ONE OF ITS
VAST FOLDS WAS DYED WITH A RICH CRIMSON LUSTER WHICH WAS SUBDUED TO A
PALE ROSE TINT IN THE DEPRESSIONS BETWEEN
IT GLOWED LIKE A MUFFLED
TORCH AND STRETCHED UPWARD TO A DIZZY HEIGHT TOWARD THE ZENITH
I
THOUGHT IT JUST POSSIBLE THAT ITS LIKE HAD NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE THE
CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WANDERED ON THEIR LONG MARCH THROUGH THE DESERT SO
MANY CENTURIES AGO OVER A PATH ILLUMINATED BY THE MYSTERIOUS PILLAR OF
FIRE AND I WAS SURE THAT I NOW HAD A VIVID CONCEPTION OF WHAT THE
MAJESTIC PILLAR OF FIRE WAS LIKE WHICH ALMOST AMOUNTED TO A
REVELATION
ARRIVED AT THE LITTLE THATCHED LOOKOUT HOUSE WE RESTED OUR ELBOWS ON THE
RAILING IN FRONT AND LOOKED ABROAD OVER THE WIDE CRATER AND DOWN OVER THE
SHEER PRECIPICE AT THE SEETHING FIRES BENEATH US
THE VIEW WAS A
STARTLING IMPROVEMENT ON MY DAYLIGHT EXPERIENCE
I TURNED TO SEE THE
EFFECT ON THE BALANCE OF THE COMPANY AND FOUND THE REDDEST FACED SET OF
MEN I ALMOST EVER SAW
IN THE STRONG LIGHT EVERY COUNTENANCE GLOWED LIKE
RED HOT IRON EVERY SHOULDER WAS SUFFUSED WITH CRIMSON AND SHADED
REARWARD INTO DINGY SHAPELESS OBSCURITY THE PLACE BELOW LOOKED LIKE
THE INFERNAL REGIONS AND THESE MEN LIKE HALF COOLED DEVILS JUST COME UP
ON A FURLOUGH
I TURNED MY EYES UPON THE VOLCANO AGAIN
THE CELLAR WAS TOLERABLY WELL
LIGHTED UP
FOR A MILE AND A HALF IN FRONT OF US AND HALF A MILE ON
EITHER SIDE THE FLOOR OF THE ABYSS WAS MAGNIFICENTLY ILLUMINATED BEYOND
THESE LIMITS THE MISTS HUNG DOWN THEIR GAUZY CURTAINS AND CAST A
DECEPTIVE GLOOM OVER ALL THAT MADE THE TWINKLING FIRES IN THE REMOTE
CORNERS OF THE CRATER SEEM COUNTLESS LEAGUES REMOVED MADE THEM SEEM LIKE
THE CAMP FIRES OF A GREAT ARMY FAR AWAY
HERE WAS ROOM FOR THE
IMAGINATION TO WORK YOU COULD IMAGINE THOSE LIGHTS THE WIDTH OF A
CONTINENT AWAY AND THAT HIDDEN UNDER THE INTERVENING DARKNESS WERE
HILLS AND WINDING RIVERS AND WEARY WASTES OF PLAIN AND DESERT AND EVEN
THEN THE TREMENDOUS VISTA STRETCHED ON AND ON AND ON TO THE FIRES AND
FAR BEYOND YOU COULD NOT COMPASS IT IT WAS THE IDEA OF ETERNITY MADE
TANGIBLE AND THE LONGEST END OF IT MADE VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE
THE GREATER PART OF THE VAST FLOOR OF THE DESERT UNDER US WAS AS BLACK AS
INK AND APPARENTLY SMOOTH AND LEVEL BUT OVER A MILE SQUARE OF IT WAS
RINGED AND STREAKED AND STRIPED WITH A THOUSAND BRANCHING STREAMS OF
LIQUID AND GORGEOUSLY BRILLIANT FIRE IT LOOKED LIKE A COLOSSAL RAILROAD
MAP OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS DONE IN CHAIN LIGHTNING ON A MIDNIGHT
SKY
IMAGINE IT IMAGINE A COAL BLACK SKY SHIVERED INTO A TANGLED
NET WORK OF ANGRY FIRE
HERE AND THERE WERE GLEAMING HOLES A HUNDRED FEET IN DIAMETER BROKEN IN
THE DARK CRUST AND IN THEM THE MELTED LAVA THE COLOR A DAZZLING WHITE
JUST TINGED WITH YELLOW WAS BOILING AND SURGING FURIOUSLY AND FROM
THESE HOLES BRANCHED NUMBERLESS BRIGHT TORRENTS IN MANY DIRECTIONS LIKE
THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL AND KEPT A TOLERABLY STRAIGHT COURSE FOR A WHILE
AND THEN SWEPT ROUND IN HUGE RAINBOW CURVES OR MADE A LONG SUCCESSION OF
SHARP WORM FENCE ANGLES WHICH LOOKED PRECISELY LIKE THE FIERCEST JAGGED
LIGHTNING
THESE STREAMS MET OTHER STREAMS AND THEY MINGLED WITH AND
CROSSED AND RECROSSED EACH OTHER IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE DIRECTION LIKE
SKATE TRACKS ON A POPULAR SKATING GROUND
SOMETIMES STREAMS TWENTY OR
THIRTY FEET WIDE FLOWED FROM THE HOLES TO SOME DISTANCE WITHOUT DIVIDING
AND THROUGH THE OPERA GLASSES WE COULD SEE THAT THEY RAN DOWN SMALL
STEEP HILLS AND WERE GENUINE CATARACTS OF FIRE WHITE AT THEIR SOURCE
BUT SOON COOLING AND TURNING TO THE RICHEST RED GRAINED WITH ALTERNATE
LINES OF BLACK AND GOLD
EVERY NOW AND THEN MASSES OF THE DARK CRUST
BROKE AWAY AND FLOATED SLOWLY DOWN THESE STREAMS LIKE RAFTS DOWN A RIVER
OCCASIONALLY THE MOLTEN LAVA FLOWING UNDER THE SUPERINCUMBENT CRUST BROKE
THROUGH SPLIT A DAZZLING STREAK FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND FEET
LONG LIKE A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND THEN ACRE AFTER ACRE OF THE
COLD LAVA PARTED INTO FRAGMENTS TURNED UP EDGEWISE LIKE CAKES OF ICE
WHEN A GREAT RIVER BREAKS UP PLUNGED DOWNWARD AND WERE SWALLOWED IN THE
CRIMSON CAULDRON
THEN THE WIDE EXPANSE OF THE THAW MAINTAINED A RUDDY
GLOW FOR A WHILE BUT SHORTLY COOLED AND BECAME BLACK AND LEVEL AGAIN
DURING A THAW EVERY DISMEMBERED CAKE WAS MARKED BY A GLITTERING WHITE
BORDER WHICH WAS SUPERBLY SHADED INWARD BY AURORA BOREALIS RAYS WHICH
WERE A FLAMING YELLOW WHERE THEY JOINED THE WHITE BORDER AND FROM THENCE
TOWARD THEIR POINTS TAPERED INTO GLOWING CRIMSON THEN INTO A RICH PALE
CARMINE AND FINALLY INTO A FAINT BLUSH THAT HELD ITS OWN A MOMENT AND
THEN DIMMED AND TURNED BLACK
SOME OF THE STREAMS PREFERRED TO MINGLE
TOGETHER IN A TANGLE OF FANTASTIC CIRCLES AND THEN THEY LOOKED SOMETHING
LIKE THE CONFUSION OF ROPES ONE SEES ON A SHIP'S DECK WHEN SHE HAS JUST
TAKEN IN SAIL AND DROPPED ANCHOR PROVIDED ONE CAN IMAGINE THOSE ROPES ON
FIRE
THROUGH THE GLASSES THE LITTLE FOUNTAINS SCATTERED ABOUT LOOKED VERY
BEAUTIFUL
THEY BOILED AND COUGHED AND SPLUTTERED AND DISCHARGED
SPRAYS OF STRINGY RED FIRE OF ABOUT THE CONSISTENCY OF MUSH FOR
INSTANCE FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN FEET INTO THE AIR ALONG WITH A SHOWER OF
BRILLIANT WHITE SPARKS A QUAINT AND UNNATURAL MINGLING OF GOUTS OF BLOOD
AND SNOW FLAKES
WE HAD CIRCLES AND SERPENTS AND STREAKS OF LIGHTNING ALL TWINED AND
WREATHED AND TIED TOGETHER WITHOUT A BREAK THROUGHOUT AN AREA MORE THAN
A MILE SQUARE THAT AMOUNT OF GROUND WAS COVERED THOUGH IT WAS NOT
STRICTLY SQUARE AND IT WAS WITH A FEELING OF PLACID EXULTATION THAT
WE REFLECTED THAT MANY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE ANY VISITOR HAD SEEN SUCH
A SPLENDID DISPLAY SINCE ANY VISITOR HAD SEEN ANYTHING MORE THAN THE NOW
SNUBBED AND INSIGNIFICANT NORTH AND SOUTH LAKES IN ACTION
WE HAD
BEEN READING OLD FILES OF HAWAIIAN NEWSPAPERS AND THE RECORD BOOK AT
THE VOLCANO HOUSE AND WERE POSTED
I COULD SEE THE NORTH LAKE LYING OUT ON THE BLACK FLOOR AWAY OFF IN THE
OUTER EDGE OF OUR PANORAMA AND KNITTED TO IT BY A WEB WORK OF LAVA
STREAMS
IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY IT LOOKED VERY LITTLE MORE
RESPECTABLE THAN A SCHOOLHOUSE ON FIRE
TRUE IT WAS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED
FEET LONG AND TWO OR THREE HUNDRED WIDE BUT THEN UNDER THE PRESENT
CIRCUMSTANCES IT NECESSARILY APPEARED RATHER INSIGNIFICANT AND BESIDES
IT WAS SO DISTANT FROM US
I FORGOT TO SAY THAT THE NOISE MADE BY THE BUBBLING LAVA IS NOT GREAT
HEARD AS WE HEARD IT FROM OUR LOFTY PERCH
IT MAKES THREE DISTINCT
SOUNDS A RUSHING A HISSING AND A COUGHING OR PUFFING SOUND AND IF YOU
STAND ON THE BRINK AND CLOSE YOUR EYES IT IS NO TRICK AT ALL TO IMAGINE
THAT YOU ARE SWEEPING DOWN A RIVER ON A LARGE LOW PRESSURE STEAMER AND
THAT YOU HEAR THE HISSING OF THE STEAM ABOUT HER BOILERS THE PUFFING
FROM HER ESCAPE PIPES AND THE CHURNING RUSH OF THE WATER ABAFT HER
WHEELS
THE SMELL OF SULPHUR IS STRONG BUT NOT UNPLEASANT TO A SINNER
WE LEFT THE LOOKOUT HOUSE AT TEN O'CLOCK IN A HALF COOKED CONDITION
BECAUSE OF THE HEAT FROM PELE'S FURNACES AND WRAPPING UP IN BLANKETS
FOR THE NIGHT WAS COLD WE RETURNED TO OUR HOTEL
CHAPTER LXXV
THE NEXT NIGHT WAS APPOINTED FOR A VISIT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER FOR
WE DESIRED TO TRAVERSE ITS FLOOR AND SEE THE NORTH LAKE OF FIRE WHICH
LAY TWO MILES AWAY TOWARD THE FURTHER WALL
AFTER DARK HALF A DOZEN OF
US SET OUT WITH LANTERNS AND NATIVE GUIDES AND CLIMBED DOWN A CRAZY
THOUSAND FOOT PATHWAY IN A CREVICE FRACTURED IN THE CRATER WALL AND
REACHED THE BOTTOM IN SAFETY
THE IRRUPTION OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING HAD SPENT ITS FORCE AND THE FLOOR
LOOKED BLACK AND COLD BUT WHEN WE RAN OUT UPON IT WE FOUND IT HOT YET
TO THE FEET AND IT WAS LIKEWISE RIVEN WITH CREVICES WHICH REVEALED THE
UNDERLYING FIRES GLEAMING VINDICTIVELY
A NEIGHBORING CAULDRON WAS
THREATENING TO OVERFLOW AND THIS ADDED TO THE DUBIOUSNESS OF THE
SITUATION
SO THE NATIVE GUIDES REFUSED TO CONTINUE THE VENTURE AND
THEN EVERY BODY DESERTED EXCEPT A STRANGER NAMED MARLETTE
HE SAID HE
HAD BEEN IN THE CRATER A DOZEN TIMES IN DAYLIGHT AND BELIEVED HE COULD
FIND HIS WAY THROUGH IT AT NIGHT
HE THOUGHT THAT A RUN OF THREE HUNDRED
YARDS WOULD CARRY US OVER THE HOTTEST PART OF THE FLOOR AND LEAVE US OUR
SHOE SOLES
HIS PLUCK GAVE ME BACK BONE
WE TOOK ONE LANTERN AND
INSTRUCTED THE GUIDES TO HANG THE OTHER TO THE ROOF OF THE LOOK OUT HOUSE
TO SERVE AS A BEACON FOR US IN CASE WE GOT LOST AND THEN THE PARTY
STARTED BACK UP THE PRECIPICE AND MARLETTE AND I MADE OUR RUN
WE SKIPPED OVER THE HOT FLOOR AND OVER THE RED CREVICES WITH BRISK
DISPATCH AND REACHED THE COLD LAVA SAFE BUT WITH PRETTY WARM FEET
THEN
WE TOOK THINGS LEISURELY AND COMFORTABLY JUMPING TOLERABLY WIDE AND
PROBABLY BOTTOMLESS CHASMS AND THREADING OUR WAY THROUGH PICTURESQUE
LAVA UPHEAVALS WITH CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE
WHEN WE GOT FAIRLY AWAY
FROM THE CAULDRONS OF BOILING FIRE WE SEEMED TO BE IN A GLOOMY DESERT
AND A SUFFOCATINGLY DARK ONE SURROUNDED BY DIM WALLS THAT SEEMED TO
TOWER TO THE SKY
THE ONLY CHEERFUL OBJECTS WERE THE GLINTING STARS HIGH
OVERHEAD
BY AND BY MARLETTE SHOUTED STOP I NEVER STOPPED QUICKER IN MY LIFE
I ASKED WHAT THE MATTER WAS
HE SAID WE WERE OUT OF THE PATH
HE SAID
WE MUST NOT TRY TO GO ON TILL WE FOUND IT AGAIN FOR WE WERE SURROUNDED
WITH BEDS OF ROTTEN LAVA THROUGH WHICH WE COULD EASILY BREAK AND PLUNGE
DOWN A THOUSAND FEET
I THOUGHT EIGHT HUNDRED WOULD ANSWER FOR ME AND
WAS ABOUT TO SAY SO WHEN MARLETTE PARTLY PROVED HIS STATEMENT BY
ACCIDENTALLY CRUSHING THROUGH AND DISAPPEARING TO HIS ARM PITS
HE GOT OUT AND WE HUNTED FOR THE PATH WITH THE LANTERN
HE SAID THERE
WAS ONLY ONE PATH AND THAT IT WAS BUT VAGUELY DEFINED
WE COULD NOT FIND
IT
THE LAVA SURFACE WAS ALL ALIKE IN THE LANTERN LIGHT
BUT HE WAS AN
INGENIOUS MAN
HE SAID IT WAS NOT THE LANTERN THAT HAD INFORMED HIM THAT
WE WERE OUT OF THE PATH BUT HIS FEET
HE HAD NOTICED A CRISP GRINDING
OF FINE LAVA NEEDLES UNDER HIS FEET AND SOME INSTINCT REMINDED HIM THAT
IN THE PATH THESE WERE ALL WORN AWAY
SO HE PUT THE LANTERN BEHIND HIM
AND BEGAN TO SEARCH WITH HIS BOOTS INSTEAD OF HIS EYES
IT WAS GOOD
SAGACITY
THE FIRST TIME HIS FOOT TOUCHED A SURFACE THAT DID NOT GRIND
UNDER IT HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRAIL WAS FOUND AGAIN AND AFTER THAT WE
KEPT UP A SHARP LISTENING FOR THE RASPING SOUND AND IT ALWAYS WARNED US
IN TIME
IT WAS A LONG TRAMP BUT AN EXCITING ONE
WE REACHED THE NORTH LAKE
BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND SAT DOWN ON A HUGE OVERHANGING
LAVA SHELF TIRED BUT SATISFIED
THE SPECTACLE PRESENTED WAS WORTH
COMING DOUBLE THE DISTANCE TO SEE
UNDER US AND STRETCHING AWAY BEFORE
US WAS A HEAVING SEA OF MOLTEN FIRE OF SEEMINGLY LIMITLESS EXTENT
THE
GLARE FROM IT WAS SO BLINDING THAT IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE WE COULD BEAR
TO LOOK UPON IT STEADILY
IT WAS LIKE GAZING AT THE SUN AT NOON DAY EXCEPT THAT THE GLARE WAS NOT
QUITE SO WHITE
AT UNEQUAL DISTANCES ALL AROUND THE SHORES OF THE LAKE
WERE NEARLY WHITE HOT CHIMNEYS OR HOLLOW DRUMS OF LAVA FOUR OR FIVE FEET
HIGH AND UP THROUGH THEM WERE BURSTING GORGEOUS SPRAYS OF LAVA GOUTS AND
GEM SPANGLES SOME WHITE SOME RED AND SOME GOLDEN A CEASELESS
BOMBARDMENT AND ONE THAT FASCINATED THE EYE WITH ITS UNAPPROACHABLE
SPLENDOR
THE MERE DISTANT JETS SPARKLING UP THROUGH AN INTERVENING
GOSSAMER VEIL OF VAPOR SEEMED MILES AWAY AND THE FURTHER THE CURVING
RANKS OF FIERY FOUNTAINS RECEDED THE MORE FAIRY LIKE AND BEAUTIFUL THEY
APPEARED
NOW AND THEN THE SURGING BOSOM OF THE LAKE UNDER OUR NOSES WOULD CALM
DOWN OMINOUSLY AND SEEM TO BE GATHERING STRENGTH FOR AN ENTERPRISE AND
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A RED DOME OF LAVA OF THE BULK OF AN ORDINARY
DWELLING WOULD HEAVE ITSELF ALOFT LIKE AN ESCAPING BALLOON THEN BURST
ASUNDER AND OUT OF ITS HEART WOULD FLIT A PALE GREEN FILM OF VAPOR AND
FLOAT UPWARD AND VANISH IN THE DARKNESS A RELEASED SOUL SOARING HOMEWARD
FROM CAPTIVITY WITH THE DAMNED NO DOUBT
THE CRASHING PLUNGE OF THE
RUINED DOME INTO THE LAKE AGAIN WOULD SEND A WORLD OF SEETHING BILLOWS
LASHING AGAINST THE SHORES AND SHAKING THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR PERCH
BY
AND BY A LOOSENED MASS OF THE HANGING SHELF WE SAT ON TUMBLED INTO THE
LAKE JARRING THE SURROUNDINGS LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE AND DELIVERING A
SUGGESTION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN INTENDED FOR A HINT AND MAY NOT
WE DID
NOT WAIT TO SEE
WE GOT LOST AGAIN ON OUR WAY BACK AND WERE MORE THAN AN HOUR HUNTING FOR
THE PATH
WE WERE WHERE WE COULD SEE THE BEACON LANTERN AT THE LOOK OUT
HOUSE AT THE TIME BUT THOUGHT IT WAS A STAR AND PAID NO ATTENTION TO IT
WE REACHED THE HOTEL AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING PRETTY WELL FAGGED
OUT
KILAUEA NEVER OVERFLOWS ITS VAST CRATER BUT BURSTS A PASSAGE FOR ITS
LAVA THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN SIDE WHEN RELIEF IS NECESSARY AND THEN THE
DESTRUCTION IS FEARFUL
ABOUT 1840 IT RENT ITS OVERBURDENED STOMACH AND
SENT A BROAD RIVER OF FIRE CAREERING DOWN TO THE SEA WHICH SWEPT AWAY
FORESTS HUTS PLANTATIONS AND EVERY THING ELSE THAT LAY IN ITS PATH
THE STREAM WAS FIVE MILES BROAD IN PLACES AND TWO HUNDRED FEET DEEP
AND THE DISTANCE IT TRAVELED WAS FORTY MILES
IT TORE UP AND BORE AWAY
ACRE PATCHES OF LAND ON ITS BOSOM LIKE RAFTS ROCKS TREES AND ALL
INTACT
AT NIGHT THE RED GLARE WAS VISIBLE A HUNDRED MILES AT SEA AND
AT A DISTANCE OF FORTY MILES FINE PRINT COULD BE READ AT MIDNIGHT
THE
ATMOSPHERE WAS POISONED WITH SULPHUROUS VAPORS AND CHOKED WITH FALLING
ASHES PUMICE STONES AND CINDERS COUNTLESS COLUMNS OF SMOKE ROSE UP AND
BLENDED TOGETHER IN A TUMBLED CANOPY THAT HID THE HEAVENS AND GLOWED WITH
A RUDDY FLUSH REFLECTED FROM THE FIRES BELOW HERE AND THERE JETS OF LAVA
SPRUNG HUNDREDS OF FEET INTO THE AIR AND BURST INTO ROCKET SPRAYS THAT
RETURNED TO EARTH IN A CRIMSON RAIN AND ALL THE WHILE THE LABORING
MOUNTAIN SHOOK WITH NATURE'S GREAT PALSY AND VOICED ITS DISTRESS IN
MOANINGS AND THE MUFFLED BOOMING OF SUBTERRANEAN THUNDERS
FISHES WERE KILLED FOR TWENTY MILES ALONG THE SHORE WHERE THE LAVA
ENTERED THE SEA
THE EARTHQUAKES CAUSED SOME LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE AND A
PRODIGIOUS TIDAL WAVE SWEPT INLAND CARRYING EVERY THING BEFORE IT AND
DROWNING A NUMBER OF NATIVES
THE DEVASTATION CONSUMMATED ALONG THE
ROUTE TRAVERSED BY THE RIVER OF LAVA WAS COMPLETE AND INCALCULABLE
ONLY
A POMPEII AND A HERCULANEUM WERE NEEDED AT THE FOOT OF KILAUEA TO MAKE
THE STORY OF THE IRRUPTION IMMORTAL
CHAPTER LXXVI
WE RODE HORSEBACK ALL AROUND THE ISLAND OF HAWAII THE CROOKED ROAD
MAKING THE DISTANCE TWO HUNDRED MILES AND ENJOYED THE JOURNEY VERY
MUCH
WE WERE MORE THAN A WEEK MAKING THE TRIP BECAUSE OUR KANAKA
HORSES WOULD NOT GO BY A HOUSE OR A HUT WITHOUT STOPPING WHIP AND SPUR
COULD NOT ALTER THEIR MINDS ABOUT IT AND SO WE FINALLY FOUND THAT IT
ECONOMIZED TIME TO LET THEM HAVE THEIR WAY
UPON INQUIRY THE MYSTERY WAS
EXPLAINED THE NATIVES ARE SUCH THOROUGH GOING GOSSIPS THAT THEY NEVER
PASS A HOUSE WITHOUT STOPPING TO SWAP NEWS AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR HORSES
LEARN TO REGARD THAT SORT OF THING AS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE WHOLE DUTY
OF MAN AND HIS SALVATION NOT TO BE COMPASSED WITHOUT IT
HOWEVER AT A
FORMER CRISIS OF MY LIFE I HAD ONCE TAKEN AN ARISTOCRATIC YOUNG LADY OUT
DRIVING BEHIND A HORSE THAT HAD JUST RETIRED FROM A LONG AND HONORABLE
CAREER AS THE MOVING IMPULSE OF A MILK WAGON AND SO THIS PRESENT
EXPERIENCE AWOKE A REMINISCENT SADNESS IN ME IN PLACE OF THE EXASPERATION
MORE NATURAL TO THE OCCASION
I REMEMBERED HOW HELPLESS I WAS THAT DAY
AND HOW HUMILIATED HOW ASHAMED I WAS OF HAVING INTIMATED TO THE GIRL
THAT I HAD ALWAYS OWNED THE HORSE AND WAS ACCUSTOMED TO GRANDEUR HOW
HARD I TRIED TO APPEAR EASY AND EVEN VIVACIOUS UNDER SUFFERING THAT WAS
CONSUMING MY VITALS HOW PLACIDLY AND MALICIOUSLY THE GIRL SMILED AND
KEPT ON SMILING WHILE MY HOT BLUSHES BAKED THEMSELVES INTO A PERMANENT
BLOOD PUDDING IN MY FACE HOW THE HORSE AMBLED FROM ONE SIDE OF THE
STREET TO THE OTHER AND WAITED COMPLACENTLY BEFORE EVERY THIRD HOUSE TWO
MINUTES AND A QUARTER WHILE I BELABORED HIS BACK AND REVILED HIM IN MY
HEART HOW I TRIED TO KEEP HIM FROM TURNING CORNERS AND FAILED HOW I
MOVED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET HIM OUT OF TOWN AND DID NOT SUCCEED HOW
HE TRAVERSED THE ENTIRE SETTLEMENT AND DELIVERED IMAGINARY MILK AT A
HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO DIFFERENT DOMICILES AND HOW HE FINALLY BROUGHT UP
AT A DAIRY DEPOT AND REFUSED TO BUDGE FURTHER THUS ROUNDING AND
COMPLETING THE REVEALMENT OF WHAT THE PLEBEIAN SERVICE OF HIS LIFE HAD
BEEN HOW IN ELOQUENT SILENCE I WALKED THE GIRL HOME AND HOW WHEN I
TOOK LEAVE OF HER HER PARTING REMARK SCORCHED MY SOUL AND APPEARED TO
BLISTER ME ALL OVER SHE SAID THAT MY HORSE WAS A FINE CAPABLE ANIMAL
AND I MUST HAVE TAKEN GREAT COMFORT IN HIM IN MY TIME BUT THAT IF I
WOULD TAKE ALONG SOME MILK TICKETS NEXT TIME AND APPEAR TO DELIVER THEM
AT THE VARIOUS HALTING PLACES IT MIGHT EXPEDITE HIS MOVEMENTS A LITTLE
THERE WAS A COOLNESS BETWEEN US AFTER THAT
IN ONE PLACE IN THE ISLAND OF HAWAII WE SAW A LACED AND RUFFLED CATARACT
OF LIMPID WATER LEAPING FROM A SHEER PRECIPICE FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH
BUT THAT SORT OF SCENERY FINDS ITS STANCHEST ALLY IN THE ARITHMETIC
RATHER THAN IN SPECTACULAR EFFECT
IF ONE DESIRES TO BE SO STIRRED BY A
POEM OF NATURE WROUGHT IN THE HAPPILY COMMINGLED GRACES OF PICTURESQUE
ROCKS GLIMPSED DISTANCES FOLIAGE COLOR SHIFTING LIGHTS AND SHADOWS
AND FAILING WATER THAT THE TEARS ALMOST COME INTO HIS EYES SO POTENT IS
THE CHARM EXERTED HE NEED NOT GO AWAY FROM AMERICA TO ENJOY SUCH AN
EXPERIENCE
THE RAINBOW FALL IN WATKINS GLEN N Y ON THE ERIE
RAILWAY IS AN EXAMPLE
IT WOULD RECEDE INTO PITIABLE INSIGNIFICANCE IF
THE CALLOUS TOURIST DREW ON ARITHMETIC ON IT BUT LEFT TO COMPETE FOR THE
HONORS SIMPLY ON SCENIC GRACE AND BEAUTY THE GRAND THE AUGUST AND THE
SUBLIME BEING BARRED THE CONTEST IT COULD CHALLENGE THE OLD WORLD AND
THE NEW TO PRODUCE ITS PEER
IN ONE LOCALITY ON OUR JOURNEY WE SAW SOME HORSES THAT HAD BEEN BORN
AND REARED ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE THE RANGE OF RUNNING WATER AND
CONSEQUENTLY THEY HAD NEVER DRANK THAT FLUID IN THEIR LIVES BUT HAD BEEN
ALWAYS ACCUSTOMED TO QUENCHING THEIR THIRST BY EATING DEW LADEN OR
SHOWER WETTED LEAVES
AND NOW IT WAS DESTRUCTIVELY FUNNY TO SEE THEM
SNIFF SUSPICIOUSLY AT A PAIL OF WATER AND THEN PUT IN THEIR NOSES AND
TRY TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF THE FLUID AS IF IT WERE A SOLID
FINDING IT
LIQUID THEY WOULD SNATCH AWAY THEIR HEADS AND FALL TO TREMBLING
SNORTING AND SHOWING OTHER EVIDENCES OF FRIGHT
WHEN THEY BECAME
CONVINCED AT LAST THAT THE WATER WAS FRIENDLY AND HARMLESS THEY THRUST
IN THEIR NOSES UP TO THEIR EYES BROUGHT OUT A MOUTHFUL OF WATER AND
PROCEEDED TO CHEW IT COMPLACENTLY
WE SAW A MAN COAX KICK AND SPUR ONE
OF THEM FIVE OR TEN MINUTES BEFORE HE COULD MAKE IT CROSS A RUNNING
STREAM
IT SPREAD ITS NOSTRILS DISTENDED ITS EYES AND TREMBLED ALL
OVER JUST AS HORSES CUSTOMARILY DO IN THE PRESENCE OF A SERPENT AND FOR
AUGHT I KNOW IT THOUGHT THE CRAWLING STREAM WAS A SERPENT
IN DUE COURSE OF TIME OUR JOURNEY CAME TO AN END AT KAWAEHAE USUALLY
PRONOUNCED TO A HI AND BEFORE WE FIND FAULT WITH THIS ELABORATE
ORTHOGRAPHICAL METHOD OF ARRIVING AT SUCH AN UNOSTENTATIOUS RESULT LET
US LOP OFF THE UGH FROM OUR WORD THOUGH
I MADE THIS HORSEBACK TRIP
ON A MULE
I PAID TEN DOLLARS FOR HIM AT KAU KAH OO ADDED FOUR TO GET
HIM SHOD RODE HIM TWO HUNDRED MILES AND THEN SOLD HIM FOR FIFTEEN
DOLLARS
I MARK THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH A WHITE STONE IN THE ABSENCE OF
CHALK FOR I NEVER SAW A WHITE STONE THAT A BODY COULD MARK ANYTHING
WITH THOUGH OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE ANCIENTS I HAVE TRIED IT OFTEN
ENOUGH FOR UP TO THAT DAY AND DATE IT WAS THE FIRST STRICTLY COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTION I HAD EVER ENTERED INTO AND COME OUT WINNER
WE RETURNED TO
HONOLULU AND FROM THENCE SAILED TO THE ISLAND OF MAUI AND SPENT SEVERAL
WEEKS THERE VERY PLEASANTLY
I STILL REMEMBER WITH A SENSE OF INDOLENT
LUXURY A PICNICING EXCURSION UP A ROMANTIC GORGE THERE CALLED THE IAO
VALLEY
THE TRAIL LAY ALONG THE EDGE OF A BRAWLING STREAM IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE GORGE A SHADY ROUTE FOR IT WAS WELL ROOFED WITH THE VERDANT
DOMES OF FOREST TREES
THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE FOLIAGE WE GLIMPSED
PICTURESQUE SCENERY THAT REVEALED CEASELESS CHANGES AND NEW CHARMS WITH
EVERY STEP OF OUR PROGRESS
PERPENDICULAR WALLS FROM ONE TO THREE
THOUSAND FEET HIGH GUARDED THE WAY AND WERE SUMPTUOUSLY PLUMED WITH
VARIED FOLIAGE IN PLACES AND IN PLACES SWATHED IN WAVING FERNS
PASSING SHREDS OF CLOUD TRAILED THEIR SHADOWS ACROSS THESE SHINING
FRONTS MOTTLING THEM WITH BLOTS BILLOWY MASSES OF WHITE VAPOR HID THE
TURRETED SUMMITS AND FAR ABOVE THE VAPOR SWELLED A BACKGROUND OF
GLEAMING GREEN CRAGS AND CONES THAT CAME AND WENT THROUGH THE VEILING
MISTS LIKE ISLANDS DRIFTING IN A FOG SOMETIMES THE CLOUDY CURTAIN
DESCENDED TILL HALF THE CANON WALL WAS HIDDEN THEN SHREDDED GRADUALLY
AWAY TILL ONLY AIRY GLIMPSES OF THE FERNY FRONT APPEARED THROUGH IT THEN
SWEPT ALOFT AND LEFT IT GLORIFIED IN THE SUN AGAIN
NOW AND THEN AS OUR
POSITION CHANGED ROCKY BASTIONS SWUNG OUT FROM THE WALL A MIMIC RUIN OF
CASTELLATED RAMPARTS AND CRUMBLING TOWERS CLOTHED WITH MOSSES AND HUNG
WITH GARLANDS OF SWAYING VINES AND AS WE MOVED ON THEY SWUNG BACK AGAIN
AND HID THEMSELVES ONCE MORE IN THE FOLIAGE
PRESENTLY A VERDURE CLAD
NEEDLE OF STONE A THOUSAND FEET HIGH STEPPED OUT FROM BEHIND A CORNER
AND MOUNTED GUARD OVER THE MYSTERIES OF THE VALLEY
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
IF CAPTAIN COOK NEEDED A MONUMENT HERE WAS ONE READY MADE THEREFORE
WHY NOT PUT UP HIS SIGN HERE AND SELL OUT THE VENERABLE COCOANUT STUMP
BUT THE CHIEF PRIDE OF MAUI IS HER DEAD VOLCANO OF HALEAKALA WHICH
MEANS TRANSLATED THE HOUSE OF THE SUN WE CLIMBED A THOUSAND FEET UP
THE SIDE OF THIS ISOLATED COLOSSUS ONE AFTERNOON THEN CAMPED AND NEXT
DAY CLIMBED THE REMAINING NINE THOUSAND FEET AND ANCHORED ON THE SUMMIT
WHERE WE BUILT A FIRE AND FROZE AND ROASTED BY TURNS ALL NIGHT
WITH
THE FIRST PALLOR OF DAWN WE GOT UP AND SAW THINGS THAT WERE NEW TO US
MOUNTED ON A COMMANDING PINNACLE WE WATCHED NATURE WORK HER SILENT
WONDERS
THE SEA WAS SPREAD ABROAD ON EVERY HAND ITS TUMBLED SURFACE
SEEMING ONLY WRINKLED AND DIMPLED IN THE DISTANCE
A BROAD VALLEY BELOW
APPEARED LIKE AN AMPLE CHECKER BOARD ITS VELVETY GREEN SUGAR PLANTATIONS
ALTERNATING WITH DUN SQUARES OF BARRENNESS AND GROVES OF TREES DIMINISHED
TO MOSSY TUFTS
BEYOND THE VALLEY WERE MOUNTAINS PICTURESQUELY GROUPED
TOGETHER BUT BEAR IN MIND WE FANCIED THAT WE WERE LOOKING UP AT THESE
THINGS NOT DOWN
WE SEEMED TO SIT IN THE BOTTOM OF A SYMMETRICAL BOWL
TEN THOUSAND FEET DEEP WITH THE VALLEY AND THE SKIRTING SEA LIFTED AWAY
INTO THE SKY ABOVE US IT WAS CURIOUS AND NOT ONLY CURIOUS BUT
AGGRAVATING FOR IT WAS HAVING OUR TROUBLE ALL FOR NOTHING TO CLIMB TEN
THOUSAND FEET TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN HAVE TO LOOK UP AT OUR SCENERY
HOWEVER WE HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH IT AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT FOR ALL
WE COULD DO WE COULD NOT COAX OUR LANDSCAPE DOWN OUT OF THE CLOUDS
FORMERLY WHEN I HAD READ AN ARTICLE IN WHICH POE TREATED OF THIS
SINGULAR FRAUD PERPETRATED UPON THE EYE BY ISOLATED GREAT ALTITUDES
I HAD LOOKED UPON THE MATTER AS AN INVENTION OF HIS OWN FANCY
I HAVE SPOKEN OF THE OUTSIDE VIEW BUT WE HAD AN INSIDE ONE TOO
THAT
WAS THE YAWNING DEAD CRATER INTO WHICH WE NOW AND THEN TUMBLED ROCKS
HALF AS LARGE AS A BARREL FROM OUR PERCH AND SAW THEM GO CAREERING DOWN
THE ALMOST PERPENDICULAR SIDES BOUNDING THREE HUNDRED FEET AT A JUMP
KICKING UP CAST CLOUDS WHEREVER THEY STRUCK DIMINISHING TO OUR VIEW AS
THEY SPED FARTHER INTO DISTANCE GROWING INVISIBLE FINALLY AND ONLY
BETRAYING THEIR COURSE BY FAINT LITTLE PUFFS OF DUST AND COMING TO A
HALT AT LAST IN THE BOTTOM OF THE ABYSS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET
DOWN FROM WHERE THEY STARTED IT WAS MAGNIFICENT SPORT
WE WORE
OURSELVES OUT AT IT
THE CRATER OF VESUVIUS AS I HAVE BEFORE REMARKED IS A MODEST PIT ABOUT
A THOUSAND FEET DEEP AND THREE THOUSAND IN CIRCUMFERENCE THAT OF KILAUEA
IS SOMEWHAT DEEPER AND TEN MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE
BUT WHAT ARE EITHER
OF THEM COMPARED TO THE VACANT STOMACH OF HALEAKALA I WILL NOT OFFER
ANY FIGURES OF MY OWN BUT GIVE OFFICIAL ONES THOSE OF COMMANDER WILKES
U S N WHO SURVEYED IT AND TESTIFIES THAT IT IS TWENTY SEVEN MILES IN
CIRCUMFERENCE IF IT HAD A LEVEL BOTTOM IT WOULD MAKE A FINE SITE FOR A
CITY LIKE LONDON
IT MUST HAVE AFFORDED A SPECTACLE WORTH CONTEMPLATING
IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN ITS FURNACES GAVE FULL REIN TO THEIR ANGER
PRESENTLY VAGRANT WHITE CLOUDS CAME DRIFTING ALONG HIGH OVER THE SEA AND
THE VALLEY THEN THEY CAME IN COUPLES AND GROUPS THEN IN IMPOSING
SQUADRONS GRADUALLY JOINING THEIR FORCES THEY BANKED THEMSELVES SOLIDLY
TOGETHER A THOUSAND FEET UNDER US AND TOTALLY SHUT OUT LAND AND OCEAN
NOT A VESTIGE OF ANYTHING WAS LEFT IN VIEW BUT JUST A LITTLE OF THE RIM
OF THE CRATER CIRCLING AWAY FROM THE PINNACLE WHEREON WE SAT FOR A
GHOSTLY PROCESSION OF WANDERERS FROM THE FILMY HOSTS WITHOUT HAD DRIFTED
THROUGH A CHASM IN THE CRATER WALL AND FILED ROUND AND ROUND AND
GATHERED AND SUNK AND BLENDED TOGETHER TILL THE ABYSS WAS STORED TO THE
BRIM WITH A FLEECY FOG
THUS BANKED MOTION CEASED AND SILENCE
REIGNED
CLEAR TO THE HORIZON LEAGUE ON LEAGUE THE SNOWY FLOOR
STRETCHED WITHOUT A BREAK NOT LEVEL BUT IN ROUNDED FOLDS WITH SHALLOW
CREASES BETWEEN AND WITH HERE AND THERE STATELY PILES OF VAPORY
ARCHITECTURE LIFTING THEMSELVES ALOFT OUT OF THE COMMON PLAIN SOME NEAR
AT HAND SOME IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCES AND OTHERS RELIEVING THE MONOTONY
OF THE REMOTE SOLITUDES
THERE WAS LITTLE CONVERSATION FOR THE
IMPRESSIVE SCENE OVERAWED SPEECH
I FELT LIKE THE LAST MAN NEGLECTED OF
THE JUDGMENT AND LEFT PINNACLED IN MID HEAVEN A FORGOTTEN RELIC OF A
VANISHED WORLD
WHILE THE HUSH YET BROODED THE MESSENGERS OF THE COMING RESURRECTION
APPEARED IN THE EAST
A GROWING WARMTH SUFFUSED THE HORIZON AND SOON
THE SUN EMERGED AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE CLOUD WASTE FLINGING BARS OF
RUDDY LIGHT ACROSS IT STAINING ITS FOLDS AND BILLOW CAPS WITH BLUSHES
PURPLING THE SHADED TROUGHS BETWEEN AND GLORIFYING THE MASSY
VAPOR PALACES AND CATHEDRALS WITH A WASTEFUL SPLENDOR OF ALL BLENDINGS
AND COMBINATIONS OF RICH COLORING
IT WAS THE SUBLIMEST SPECTACLE I EVER WITNESSED AND I THINK THE MEMORY
OF IT WILL REMAIN WITH ME ALWAYS
CHAPTER LXXVII
I STUMBLED UPON ONE CURIOUS CHARACTER IN THE ISLAND OF MANI
HE BECAME A
SORE ANNOYANCE TO ME IN THE COURSE OF TIME
MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF HIM WAS
IN A SORT OF PUBLIC ROOM IN THE TOWN OF LAHAINA
HE OCCUPIED A CHAIR AT
THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE APARTMENT AND SAT EYEING OUR PARTY WITH
INTEREST FOR SOME MINUTES AND LISTENING AS CRITICALLY TO WHAT WE WERE
SAYING AS IF HE FANCIED WE WERE TALKING TO HIM AND EXPECTING HIM TO
REPLY
I THOUGHT IT VERY SOCIABLE IN A STRANGER
PRESENTLY IN THE
COURSE OF CONVERSATION I MADE A STATEMENT BEARING UPON THE SUBJECT UNDER
DISCUSSION AND I MADE IT WITH DUE MODESTY FOR THERE WAS NOTHING
EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT IT AND IT WAS ONLY PUT FORTH IN ILLUSTRATION OF A
POINT AT ISSUE
I HAD BARELY FINISHED WHEN THIS PERSON SPOKE OUT WITH
RAPID UTTERANCE AND FEVERISH ANXIETY
OH THAT WAS CERTAINLY REMARKABLE AFTER A FASHION BUT YOU OUGHT TO
HAVE SEEN MY CHIMNEY YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SEEN MY CHIMNEY SIR SMOKE
I WISH I MAY HANG IF MR
JONES YOU REMEMBER THAT CHIMNEY YOU MUST
REMEMBER THAT CHIMNEY NO NO I RECOLLECT NOW YOU WARN'T LIVING ON
THIS SIDE OF THE ISLAND THEN
BUT I AM TELLING YOU NOTHING BUT THE
TRUTH AND I WISH I MAY NEVER DRAW ANOTHER BREATH IF THAT CHIMNEY DIDN'T
SMOKE SO THAT THE SMOKE ACTUALLY GOT CAKED IN IT AND I HAD TO DIG IT OUT
WITH A PICKAXE YOU MAY SMILE GENTLEMEN BUT THE HIGH SHERIFF'S GOT A
HUNK OF IT WHICH I DUG OUT BEFORE HIS EYES AND SO IT'S PERFECTLY EASY
FOR YOU TO GO AND EXAMINE FOR YOURSELVES
THE INTERRUPTION BROKE UP THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO
LAG AND WE PRESENTLY HIRED SOME NATIVES AND AN OUT RIGGER CANOE OR TWO
AND WENT OUT TO OVERLOOK A GRAND SURF BATHING CONTEST
TWO WEEKS AFTER THIS WHILE TALKING IN A COMPANY I LOOKED UP AND
DETECTED THIS SAME MAN BORING THROUGH AND THROUGH ME WITH HIS INTENSE
EYE AND NOTED AGAIN HIS TWITCHING MUSCLES AND HIS FEVERISH ANXIETY TO
SPEAK
THE MOMENT I PAUSED HE SAID
BEG YOUR PARDON SIR BEG YOUR PARDON BUT IT CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED
REMARKABLE WHEN BROUGHT INTO STRONG OUTLINE BY ISOLATION
SIR
CONTRASTED WITH A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH OCCURRED IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE IT
INSTANTLY BECOMES COMMONPLACE
NO NOT THAT FOR I WILL NOT SPEAK SO
DISCOURTEOUSLY OF ANY EXPERIENCE IN THE CAREER OF A STRANGER AND A
GENTLEMAN BUT I AM OBLIGED TO SAY THAT YOU COULD NOT AND YOU WOULD NOT
EVER AGAIN REFER TO THIS TREE AS A LARGE ONE IF YOU COULD BEHOLD AS I
HAVE THE GREAT YAKMATACK TREE IN THE ISLAND OF OUNASKA SEA OF
KAMTCHATKA A TREE SIR NOT ONE INCH LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN
FEET IN SOLID DIAMETER AND I WISH I MAY DIE IN A MINUTE IF IT ISN'T SO
OH YOU NEEDN'T LOOK SO QUESTIONING GENTLEMEN HERE'S OLD CAP SALTMARSH
CAN SAY WHETHER I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT OR NOT
I SHOWED HIM THE
TREE
CAPTAIN SALTMARSH COME NOW CAT YOUR ANCHOR LAD YOU'RE HEAVING TOO
TAUT
YOU PROMISED TO SHOW ME THAT STUNNER AND I WALKED MORE THAN
ELEVEN MILE WITH YOU THROUGH THE CUSSEDEST JUNGLE I EVER SEE A HUNTING
FOR IT BUT THE TREE YOU SHOWED ME FINALLY WARN'T AS BIG AROUND AS A BEER
CASK AND YOU KNOW THAT YOUR OWN SELF MARKISS
HEAR THE MAN TALK OF COURSE THE TREE WAS REDUCED THAT WAY BUT DIDN'T
I EXPLAIN IT ANSWER ME DIDN'T I DIDN'T I SAY I WISHED YOU COULD HAVE
SEEN IT WHEN I FIRST SAW IT WHEN YOU GOT UP ON YOUR EAR AND CALLED ME
NAMES AND SAID I HAD BROUGHT YOU ELEVEN MILES TO LOOK AT A SAPLING
DIDN'T I EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT ALL THE WHALE SHIPS IN THE NORTH SEAS HAD
BEEN WOODING OFF OF IT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND DID YOU
S'POSE THE TREE COULD LAST FOR EVER CON FOUND IT I DON'T SEE WHY YOU
WANT TO KEEP BACK THINGS THAT WAY AND TRY TO INJURE A PERSON THAT'S
NEVER DONE YOU ANY HARM
SOMEHOW THIS MAN'S PRESENCE MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE AND I WAS GLAD WHEN A
NATIVE ARRIVED AT THAT MOMENT TO SAY THAT MUCKAWOW THE MOST
COMPANIONABLE AND LUXURIOUS AMONG THE RUDE WAR CHIEFS OF THE ISLANDS
DESIRED US TO COME OVER AND HELP HIM ENJOY A MISSIONARY WHOM HE HAD FOUND
TRESPASSING ON HIS GROUNDS
I THINK IT WAS ABOUT TEN DAYS AFTERWARD THAT AS I FINISHED A STATEMENT I
WAS MAKING FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF A GROUP OF FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES
AND WHICH MADE NO PRETENCE OF BEING EXTRAORDINARY A FAMILIAR VOICE
CHIMED INSTANTLY IN ON THE HEELS OF MY LAST WORD AND SAID
BUT MY DEAR SIR THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT THAT HORSE OR THE
CIRCUMSTANCE EITHER NOTHING IN THE WORLD I MEAN NO SORT OF OFFENCE
WHEN I SAY IT SIR BUT YOU REALLY DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING WHATEVER ABOUT
SPEED
BLESS YOUR HEART IF YOU COULD ONLY HAVE SEEN MY MARE MARGARETTA
THERE WAS A BEAST THERE WAS LIGHTNING FOR YOU TROT TROT IS NO NAME
FOR IT SHE FLEW HOW SHE COULD WHIRL A BUGGY ALONG I STARTED HER OUT
ONCE SIR COLONEL BILGEWATER YOU RECOLLECT THAT ANIMAL PERFECTLY WELL
I STARTED HER OUT ABOUT THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE YARDS AHEAD OF THE
AWFULLEST STORM I EVER SAW IN MY LIFE AND IT CHASED US UPWARDS OF
EIGHTEEN MILES IT DID BY THE EVERLASTING HILLS AND I'M TELLING YOU
NOTHING BUT THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT NOT ONE SINGLE DROP OF
RAIN FELL ON ME NOT A SINGLE DROP SIR AND I SWEAR TO IT BUT MY DOG
WAS A SWIMMING BEHIND THE WAGON ALL THE WAY
FOR A WEEK OR TWO I STAYED MOSTLY WITHIN DOORS FOR I SEEMED TO MEET THIS
PERSON EVERYWHERE AND HE HAD BECOME UTTERLY HATEFUL TO ME
BUT ONE
EVENING I DROPPED IN ON CAPTAIN PERKINS AND HIS FRIENDS AND WE HAD A
SOCIABLE TIME
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK I CHANCED TO BE TALKING ABOUT A
MERCHANT FRIEND OF MINE AND WITHOUT REALLY INTENDING IT THE REMARK
SLIPPED OUT THAT HE WAS A LITTLE MEAN AND PARSIMONIOUS ABOUT PAYING HIS
WORKMEN
INSTANTLY THROUGH THE STEAM OF A HOT WHISKEY PUNCH ON THE
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM A REMEMBERED VOICE SHOT AND FOR A MOMENT I
TREMBLED ON THE IMMINENT VERGE OF PROFANITY
OH MY DEAR SIR REALLY YOU EXPOSE YOURSELF WHEN YOU PARADE THAT AS A
SURPRISING CIRCUMSTANCE
BLESS YOUR HEART AND HIDE YOU ARE IGNORANT OF
THE VERY A B C OF MEANNESS IGNORANT AS THE UNBORN BABE IGNORANT AS
UNBORN TWINS YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT IS PITIABLE TO SEE
YOU SIR A WELL SPOKEN AND PREPOSSESSING STRANGER MAKING SUCH AN
ENORMOUS POW WOW HERE ABOUT A SUBJECT CONCERNING WHICH YOUR IGNORANCE IS
PERFECTLY HUMILIATING LOOK ME IN THE EYE IF YOU PLEASE LOOK ME IN THE
EYE
JOHN JAMES GODFREY WAS THE SON OF POOR BUT HONEST PARENTS IN THE
STATE OF MISSISSIPPI BOYHOOD FRIEND OF MINE BOSOM COMRADE IN LATER
YEARS
HEAVEN REST HIS NOBLE SPIRIT HE IS GONE FROM US NOW
JOHN JAMES
GODFREY WAS HIRED BY THE HAYBLOSSOM MINING COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA TO DO
SOME BLASTING FOR THEM THE INCORPORATED COMPANY OF MEAN MEN THE BOYS
USED TO CALL IT
WELL ONE DAY HE DRILLED A HOLE ABOUT FOUR FEET DEEP AND PUT IN AN AWFUL
BLAST OF POWDER AND WAS STANDING OVER IT RAMMING IT DOWN WITH AN IRON
CROWBAR ABOUT NINE FOOT LONG WHEN THE CUSSED THING STRUCK A SPARK AND
FIRED THE POWDER AND SCAT AWAY JOHN GODFREY WHIZZED LIKE A SKYROCKET
HIM AND HIS CROWBAR WELL SIR HE KEPT ON GOING UP IN THE AIR HIGHER
AND HIGHER TILL HE DIDN'T LOOK ANY BIGGER THAN A BOY AND HE KEPT GOING
ON UP HIGHER AND HIGHER TILL HE DIDN'T LOOK ANY BIGGER THAN A DOLL AND
HE KEPT ON GOING UP HIGHER AND HIGHER TILL HE DIDN'T LOOK ANY BIGGER
THAN A LITTLE SMALL BEE AND THEN HE WENT OUT OF SIGHT PRESENTLY HE
CAME IN SIGHT AGAIN LOOKING LIKE A LITTLE SMALL BEE AND HE CAME ALONG
DOWN FURTHER AND FURTHER TILL HE LOOKED AS BIG AS A DOLL AGAIN AND DOWN
FURTHER AND FURTHER TILL HE WAS AS BIG AS A BOY AGAIN AND FURTHER AND
FURTHER TILL HE WAS A FULL SIZED MAN ONCE MORE AND THEN HIM AND HIS
CROWBAR CAME A WH IZZING DOWN AND LIT RIGHT EXACTLY IN THE SAME OLD
TRACKS AND WENT TO R RAMMING DOWN AND R RAMMING DOWN AND R RAMMING DOWN
AGAIN JUST THE SAME AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED NOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
POOR CUSS WARN'T GONE ONLY SIXTEEN MINUTES AND YET THAT INCORPORATED
COMPANY OF MEAN MEN DOCKED HIM FOR THE LOST TIME
I SAID I HAD THE HEADACHE AND SO EXCUSED MYSELF AND WENT HOME
AND ON
MY DIARY I ENTERED ANOTHER NIGHT SPOILED BY THIS OFFENSIVE LOAFER
AND A FERVENT CURSE WAS SET DOWN WITH IT TO KEEP THE ITEM COMPANY
AND
THE VERY NEXT DAY I PACKED UP OUT OF ALL PATIENCE AND LEFT THE ISLAND
ALMOST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING I REGARDED THAT MAN AS A LIAR
THE LINE OF POINTS REPRESENTS AN INTERVAL OF YEARS
AT THE END OF WHICH
TIME THE OPINION HAZARDED IN THAT LAST SENTENCE CAME TO BE GRATIFYINGLY
AND REMARKABLY ENDORSED AND BY WHOLLY DISINTERESTED PERSONS
THE MAN
MARKISS WAS FOUND ONE MORNING HANGING TO A BEAM OF HIS OWN BEDROOM THE
DOORS AND WINDOWS SECURELY FASTENED ON THE INSIDE DEAD AND ON HIS
BREAST WAS PINNED A PAPER IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING BEGGING HIS FRIENDS TO
SUSPECT NO INNOCENT PERSON OF HAVING ANY THING TO DO WITH HIS DEATH FOR
THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF HIS OWN HANDS ENTIRELY
YET THE JURY BROUGHT IN
THE ASTOUNDING VERDICT THAT DECEASED CAME TO HIS DEATH BY THE HANDS OF
SOME PERSON OR PERSONS UNKNOWN THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE PERFECTLY
UNDEVIATING CONSISTENCY OF MARKISS'S CHARACTER FOR THIRTY YEARS TOWERED
ALOFT AS COLOSSAL AND INDESTRUCTIBLE TESTIMONY THAT WHATEVER STATEMENT
HE CHOSE TO MAKE WAS ENTITLED TO INSTANT AND UNQUESTIONING ACCEPTANCE AS
A LIE
AND THEY FURTHERMORE STATED THEIR BELIEF THAT HE WAS NOT DEAD
AND INSTANCED THE STRONG CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF HIS OWN WORD THAT HE
WAS DEAD AND BESEECHED THE CORONER TO DELAY THE FUNERAL AS LONG AS
POSSIBLE WHICH WAS DONE
AND SO IN THE TROPICAL CLIMATE OF LAHAINA THE
COFFIN STOOD OPEN FOR SEVEN DAYS AND THEN EVEN THE LOYAL JURY GAVE HIM
UP
BUT THEY SAT ON HIM AGAIN AND CHANGED THEIR VERDICT TO SUICIDE
INDUCED BY MENTAL ABERRATION BECAUSE SAID THEY WITH PENETRATION HE
SAID HE WAS DEAD AND HE WAS DEAD AND WOULD HE HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH IF HE
HAD BEEN IN HIS RIGHT MIND NO SIR
CHAPTER LXXVIII
AFTER HALF A YEAR'S LUXURIOUS VAGRANCY IN THE ISLANDS I TOOK SHIPPING IN
A SAILING VESSEL AND REGRETFULLY RETURNED TO SAN FRANCISCO A VOYAGE IN
EVERY WAY DELIGHTFUL BUT WITHOUT AN INCIDENT UNLESS LYING TWO LONG
WEEKS IN A DEAD CALM EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND MAY
RANK AS AN INCIDENT
SCHOOLS OF WHALES GREW SO TAME THAT DAY AFTER DAY
THEY PLAYED ABOUT THE SHIP AMONG THE PORPOISES AND THE SHARKS WITHOUT THE
LEAST APPARENT FEAR OF US AND WE PELTED THEM WITH EMPTY BOTTLES FOR LACK
OF BETTER SPORT
TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTERWARD THESE BOTTLES WOULD BE
STILL LYING ON THE GLASSY WATER UNDER OUR NOSES SHOWING THAT THE SHIP
HAD NOT MOVED OUT OF HER PLACE IN ALL THAT TIME
THE CALM WAS ABSOLUTELY
BREATHLESS AND THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT A WRINKLE
FOR A WHOLE DAY AND PART OF A NIGHT WE LAY SO CLOSE TO ANOTHER SHIP THAT
HAD DRIFTED TO OUR VICINITY THAT WE CARRIED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH HER
PASSENGERS INTRODUCED EACH OTHER BY NAME AND BECAME PRETTY INTIMATELY
ACQUAINTED WITH PEOPLE WE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE AND HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF SINCE
THIS WAS THE ONLY VESSEL WE SAW DURING THE WHOLE LONELY
VOYAGE
WE HAD FIFTEEN PASSENGERS AND TO SHOW HOW HARD PRESSED THEY
WERE AT LAST FOR OCCUPATION AND AMUSEMENT I WILL MENTION THAT THE
GENTLEMEN GAVE A GOOD PART OF THEIR TIME EVERY DAY DURING THE CALM TO
TRYING TO SIT ON AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE LYING ON ITS SIDE AND
THREAD A NEEDLE WITHOUT TOUCHING THEIR HEELS TO THE DECK OR FALLING
OVER AND THE LADIES SAT IN THE SHADE OF THE MAINSAIL AND WATCHED THE
ENTERPRISE WITH ABSORBING INTEREST
WE WERE AT SEA FIVE SUNDAYS AND
YET BUT FOR THE ALMANAC WE NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN BUT THAT ALL THE
OTHER DAYS WERE SUNDAYS TOO
I WAS HOME AGAIN IN SAN FRANCISCO WITHOUT MEANS AND WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT
I TORTURED MY BRAIN FOR A SAVING SCHEME OF SOME KIND AND AT LAST A
PUBLIC LECTURE OCCURRED TO ME I SAT DOWN AND WROTE ONE IN A FEVER OF
HOPEFUL ANTICIPATION
I SHOWED IT TO SEVERAL FRIENDS BUT THEY ALL SHOOK
THEIR HEADS
THEY SAID NOBODY WOULD COME TO HEAR ME AND I WOULD MAKE A
HUMILIATING FAILURE OF IT
THEY SAID THAT AS I HAD NEVER SPOKEN IN PUBLIC I WOULD BREAK DOWN IN THE
DELIVERY ANYHOW
I WAS DISCONSOLATE NOW
BUT AT LAST AN EDITOR SLAPPED
ME ON THE BACK AND TOLD ME TO GO AHEAD HE SAID TAKE THE LARGEST
HOUSE IN TOWN AND CHARGE A DOLLAR A TICKET THE AUDACITY OF THE
PROPOSITION WAS CHARMING IT SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH PRACTICAL WORLDLY
WISDOM HOWEVER
THE PROPRIETOR OF THE SEVERAL THEATRES ENDORSED THE
ADVICE AND SAID I MIGHT HAVE HIS HANDSOME NEW OPERA HOUSE AT HALF PRICE
FIFTY DOLLARS
IN SHEER DESPERATION I TOOK IT ON CREDIT FOR
SUFFICIENT REASONS
IN THREE DAYS I DID A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS'
WORTH OF PRINTING AND ADVERTISING AND WAS THE MOST DISTRESSED AND
FRIGHTENED CREATURE ON THE PACIFIC COAST
I COULD NOT SLEEP WHO COULD
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES FOR OTHER PEOPLE THERE WAS FACETIOUSNESS IN
THE LAST LINE OF MY POSTERS BUT TO ME IT WAS PLAINTIVE WITH A PANG WHEN
I WROTE IT
DOORS OPEN AT 7 1 2
THE TROUBLE WILL BEGIN AT 8
THAT LINE HAS DONE GOOD SERVICE SINCE
SHOWMEN HAVE BORROWED IT
FREQUENTLY
I HAVE EVEN SEEN IT APPENDED TO A NEWSPAPER ADVERTISEMENT
REMINDING SCHOOL PUPILS IN VACATION WHAT TIME NEXT TERM WOULD BEGIN
AS
THOSE THREE DAYS OF SUSPENSE DRAGGED BY I GREW MORE AND MORE UNHAPPY
I HAD SOLD TWO HUNDRED TICKETS AMONG MY PERSONAL FRIENDS BUT I FEARED
THEY MIGHT NOT COME
MY LECTURE WHICH HAD SEEMED HUMOROUS TO ME AT
FIRST GREW STEADILY MORE AND MORE DREARY TILL NOT A VESTIGE OF FUN
SEEMED LEFT AND I GRIEVED THAT I COULD NOT BRING A COFFIN ON THE STAGE
AND TURN THE THING INTO A FUNERAL
I WAS SO PANIC STRICKEN AT LAST
THAT I WENT TO THREE OLD FRIENDS GIANTS IN STATURE CORDIAL BY NATURE
AND STORMY VOICED AND SAID
THIS THING IS GOING TO BE A FAILURE THE JOKES IN IT ARE SO DIM THAT
NOBODY WILL EVER SEE THEM I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU SIT IN THE PARQUETTE
AND HELP ME THROUGH
THEY SAID THEY WOULD
THEN I WENT TO THE WIFE OF A POPULAR CITIZEN AND
SAID THAT IF SHE WAS WILLING TO DO ME A VERY GREAT KINDNESS I WOULD BE
GLAD IF SHE AND HER HUSBAND WOULD SIT PROMINENTLY IN THE LEFT HAND
STAGE BOX WHERE THE WHOLE HOUSE COULD SEE THEM
I EXPLAINED THAT I
SHOULD NEED HELP AND WOULD TURN TOWARD HER AND SMILE AS A SIGNAL WHEN
I HAD BEEN DELIVERED OF AN OBSCURE JOKE AND THEN I ADDED DON'T WAIT
TO INVESTIGATE BUT RESPOND
SHE PROMISED
DOWN THE STREET I MET A MAN I NEVER HAD SEEN BEFORE
HE
HAD BEEN DRINKING AND WAS BEAMING WITH SMILES AND GOOD NATURE
HE SAID
MY NAME'S SAWYER
YOU DON'T KNOW ME BUT THAT DON'T MATTER
I HAVEN'T
GOT A CENT BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW BAD I WANTED TO LAUGH YOU'D GIVE ME A
TICKET
COME NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY
IS YOUR LAUGH HUNG ON A HAIR TRIGGER THAT IS IS IT CRITICAL OR CAN
YOU GET IT OFF EASY
MY DRAWLING INFIRMITY OF SPEECH SO AFFECTED HIM THAT HE LAUGHED A
SPECIMEN OR TWO THAT STRUCK ME AS BEING ABOUT THE ARTICLE I WANTED AND I
GAVE HIM A TICKET AND APPOINTED HIM TO SIT IN THE SECOND CIRCLE IN THE
CENTRE AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DIVISION OF THE HOUSE
I GAVE HIM
MINUTE INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT HOW TO DETECT INDISTINCT JOKES AND THEN WENT
AWAY AND LEFT HIM CHUCKLING PLACIDLY OVER THE NOVELTY OF THE IDEA
I ATE NOTHING ON THE LAST OF THE THREE EVENTFUL DAYS I ONLY SUFFERED
I HAD ADVERTISED THAT ON THIS THIRD DAY THE BOX OFFICE WOULD BE OPENED
FOR THE SALE OF RESERVED SEATS
I CREPT DOWN TO THE THEATER AT FOUR IN
THE AFTERNOON TO SEE IF ANY SALES HAD BEEN MADE
THE TICKET SELLER WAS
GONE THE BOX OFFICE WAS LOCKED UP
I HAD TO SWALLOW SUDDENLY OR MY
HEART WOULD HAVE GOT OUT
NO SALES I SAID TO MYSELF I MIGHT HAVE
KNOWN IT I THOUGHT OF SUICIDE PRETENDED ILLNESS FLIGHT
I THOUGHT
OF THESE THINGS IN EARNEST FOR I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND SCARED
BUT OF
COURSE I HAD TO DRIVE THEM AWAY AND PREPARE TO MEET MY FATE
I COULD
NOT WAIT FOR HALF PAST SEVEN I WANTED TO FACE THE HORROR AND END IT
THE FEELING OF MANY A MAN DOOMED TO HANG NO DOUBT
I WENT DOWN BACK
STREETS AT SIX O'CLOCK AND ENTERED THE THEATRE BY THE BACK DOOR
I STUMBLED MY WAY IN THE DARK AMONG THE RANKS OF CANVAS SCENERY AND
STOOD ON THE STAGE
THE HOUSE WAS GLOOMY AND SILENT AND ITS EMPTINESS
DEPRESSING
I WENT INTO THE DARK AMONG THE SCENES AGAIN AND FOR AN HOUR
AND A HALF GAVE MYSELF UP TO THE HORRORS WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF
EVERYTHING ELSE
THEN I HEARD A MURMUR IT ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER AND
ENDED IN A CRASH MINGLED WITH CHEERS
IT MADE MY HAIR RAISE IT WAS SO
CLOSE TO ME AND SO LOUD
THERE WAS A PAUSE AND THEN ANOTHER PRESENTLY CAME A THIRD AND BEFORE I
WELL KNEW WHAT I WAS ABOUT I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE STARING AT
A SEA OF FACES BEWILDERED BY THE FIERCE GLARE OF THE LIGHTS AND QUAKING
IN EVERY LIMB WITH A TERROR THAT SEEMED LIKE TO TAKE MY LIFE AWAY
THE
HOUSE WAS FULL AISLES AND ALL
THE TUMULT IN MY HEART AND BRAIN AND LEGS CONTINUED A FULL MINUTE BEFORE
I COULD GAIN ANY COMMAND OVER MYSELF
THEN I RECOGNIZED THE CHARITY AND
THE FRIENDLINESS IN THE FACES BEFORE ME AND LITTLE BY LITTLE MY FRIGHT
MELTED AWAY AND I BEGAN TO TALK WITHIN THREE OR FOUR MINUTES I WAS
COMFORTABLE AND EVEN CONTENT
MY THREE CHIEF ALLIES WITH THREE
AUXILIARIES WERE ON HAND IN THE PARQUETTE ALL SITTING TOGETHER ALL
ARMED WITH BLUDGEONS AND ALL READY TO MAKE AN ONSLAUGHT UPON THE
FEEBLEST JOKE THAT MIGHT SHOW ITS HEAD
AND WHENEVER A JOKE DID FALL
THEIR BLUDGEONS CAME DOWN AND THEIR FACES SEEMED TO SPLIT FROM EAR TO
EAR
SAWYER WHOSE HEARTY COUNTENANCE WAS SEEN LOOMING REDLY IN THE CENTRE OF
THE SECOND CIRCLE TOOK IT UP AND THE HOUSE WAS CARRIED HANDSOMELY
INFERIOR JOKES NEVER FARED SO ROYALLY BEFORE
PRESENTLY I DELIVERED A
BIT OF SERIOUS MATTER WITH IMPRESSIVE UNCTION IT WAS MY PET AND THE
AUDIENCE LISTENED WITH AN ABSORBED HUSH THAT GRATIFIED ME MORE THAN ANY
APPLAUSE AND AS I DROPPED THE LAST WORD OF THE CLAUSE I HAPPENED TO
TURN AND CATCH MRS 'S INTENT AND WAITING EYE MY CONVERSATION WITH HER
FLASHED UPON ME AND IN SPITE OF ALL I COULD DO I SMILED
SHE TOOK IT
FOR THE SIGNAL AND PROMPTLY DELIVERED A MELLOW LAUGH THAT TOUCHED OFF
THE WHOLE AUDIENCE AND THE EXPLOSION THAT FOLLOWED WAS THE TRIUMPH OF
THE EVENING
I THOUGHT THAT THAT HONEST MAN SAWYER WOULD CHOKE HIMSELF
AND AS FOR THE BLUDGEONS THEY PERFORMED LIKE PILE DRIVERS
BUT MY POOR
LITTLE MORSEL OF PATHOS WAS RUINED
IT WAS TAKEN IN GOOD FAITH AS AN
INTENTIONAL JOKE AND THE PRIZE ONE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AND I WISELY
LET IT GO AT THAT
ALL THE PAPERS WERE KIND IN THE MORNING MY APPETITE RETURNED I HAD A
ABUNDANCE OF MONEY
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL
CHAPTER LXXIX
I LAUNCHED OUT AS A LECTURER NOW WITH GREAT BOLDNESS
I HAD THE FIELD
ALL TO MYSELF FOR PUBLIC LECTURES WERE ALMOST AN UNKNOWN COMMODITY IN
THE PACIFIC MARKET
THEY ARE NOT SO RARE NOW I SUPPOSE
I TOOK AN OLD
PERSONAL FRIEND ALONG TO PLAY AGENT FOR ME AND FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS WE
ROAMED THROUGH NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA AND HAD A VERY CHEERFUL TIME OF IT
TWO DAYS BEFORE I LECTURED IN VIRGINIA CITY TWO STAGECOACHES WERE ROBBED
WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE TOWN
THE DARING ACT WAS COMMITTED JUST AT DAWN
BY SIX MASKED MEN WHO SPRANG UP ALONGSIDE THE COACHES PRESENTED
REVOLVERS AT THE HEADS OF THE DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS AND COMMANDED A
GENERAL DISMOUNT
EVERYBODY CLIMBED DOWN AND THE ROBBERS TOOK THEIR
WATCHES AND EVERY CENT THEY HAD
THEN THEY TOOK GUNPOWDER AND BLEW UP
THE EXPRESS SPECIE BOXES AND GOT THEIR CONTENTS
THE LEADER OF THE
ROBBERS WAS A SMALL QUICK SPOKEN MAN AND THE FAME OF HIS VIGOROUS
MANNER AND HIS INTREPIDITY WAS IN EVERYBODY'S MOUTH WHEN WE ARRIVED
THE NIGHT AFTER INSTRUCTING VIRGINIA I WALKED OVER THE DESOLATE DIVIDE
AND DOWN TO GOLD HILL AND LECTURED THERE
THE LECTURE DONE I STOPPED
TO TALK WITH A FRIEND AND DID NOT START BACK TILL ELEVEN
THE DIVIDE
WAS HIGH UNOCCUPIED GROUND BETWEEN THE TOWNS THE SCENE OF TWENTY
MIDNIGHT MURDERS AND A HUNDRED ROBBERIES
AS WE CLIMBED UP AND STEPPED
OUT ON THIS EMINENCE THE GOLD HILL LIGHTS DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT AT OUR
BACKS AND THE NIGHT CLOSED DOWN GLOOMY AND DISMAL
A SHARP WIND SWEPT
THE PLACE TOO AND CHILLED OUR PERSPIRING BODIES THROUGH
I TELL YOU I DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE AT NIGHT SAID MIKE THE AGENT
WELL DON'T SPEAK SO LOUD I SAID
YOU NEEDN'T REMIND ANYBODY THAT WE
ARE HERE
JUST THEN A DIM FIGURE APPROACHED ME FROM THE DIRECTION OF VIRGINIA A
MAN EVIDENTLY
HE CAME STRAIGHT AT ME AND I STEPPED ASIDE TO LET HIM
PASS HE STEPPED IN THE WAY AND CONFRONTED ME AGAIN
THEN I SAW THAT HE
HAD A MASK ON AND WAS HOLDING SOMETHING IN MY FACE I HEARD A CLICK CLICK
AND RECOGNIZED A REVOLVER IN DIM OUTLINE
I PUSHED THE BARREL ASIDE WITH
MY HAND AND SAID
DON'T
HE EJACULATED SHARPLY
YOUR WATCH YOUR MONEY
I SAID
YOU CAN HAVE THEM WITH PLEASURE BUT TAKE THE PISTOL AWAY FROM MY FACE
PLEASE
IT MAKES ME SHIVER
NO REMARKS HAND OUT YOUR MONEY
CERTAINLY I
PUT UP YOUR HANDS DON'T YOU GO FOR A WEAPON PUT 'EM UP HIGHER
I HELD THEM ABOVE MY HEAD
A PAUSE
THEN
ARE YOU GOING TO HAND OUT YOUR MONEY OR NOT
I DROPPED MY HANDS TO MY POCKETS AND SAID
CERTAINLY I
PUT UP YOUR HANDS DO YOU WANT YOUR HEAD BLOWN OFF HIGHER
I PUT THEM ABOVE MY HEAD AGAIN
ANOTHER PAUSE
ARE YOU GOING TO HAND OUT YOUR MONEY OR NOT AH AH AGAIN PUT UP YOUR
HANDS BY GEORGE YOU WANT THE HEAD SHOT OFF YOU AWFUL BAD
WELL FRIEND I'M TRYING MY BEST TO PLEASE YOU
YOU TELL ME TO GIVE UP
MY MONEY AND WHEN I REACH FOR IT YOU TELL ME TO PUT UP MY HANDS
IF YOU
WOULD ONLY
OH NOW DON'T ALL SIX OF YOU AT ME THAT OTHER MAN
WILL GET AWAY WHILE NOW PLEASE TAKE SOME OF THOSE REVOLVERS OUT OF MY
FACE DO IF YOU PLEASE EVERY TIME ONE OF THEM CLICKS MY LIVER COMES
UP INTO MY THROAT IF YOU HAVE A MOTHER ANY OF YOU OR IF ANY OF YOU
HAVE EVER HAD A MOTHER OR A GRANDMOTHER OR A
CHEESE IT WILL YOU GIVE UP YOUR MONEY OR HAVE WE GOT TO
THERE
THERE NONE OF THAT PUT UP YOUR HANDS
GENTLEMEN I KNOW YOU ARE GENTLEMEN BY YOUR
SILENCE IF YOU WANT TO BE FACETIOUS YOUNG MAN THERE ARE TIMES AND
PLACES MORE FITTING
THIS IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS
YOU PRICK THE MARROW OF MY OPINION
THE FUNERALS I HAVE ATTENDED IN MY
TIME WERE COMEDIES COMPARED TO IT
NOW I THINK
CURSE YOUR PALAVER YOUR MONEY YOUR MONEY YOUR MONEY HOLD PUT
UP YOUR HANDS
GENTLEMEN LISTEN TO REASON
YOU SEE HOW I AM SITUATED NOW DON'T PUT
THOSE PISTOLS SO CLOSE I SMELL THE POWDER
YOU SEE HOW I AM SITUATED
IF I HAD FOUR HANDS SO THAT I COULD HOLD UP
TWO AND
THROTTLE HIM GAG HIM KILL HIM
GENTLEMEN DON'T NOBODY'S WATCHING THE OTHER FELLOW
WHY DON'T SOME
OF YOU
OUCH TAKE IT AWAY PLEASE
GENTLEMEN YOU SEE THAT I'VE GOT TO HOLD UP MY HANDS AND SO I CAN'T TAKE
OUT MY MONEY BUT IF YOU'LL BE SO KIND AS TO TAKE IT OUT FOR ME I WILL
DO AS MUCH FOR YOU SOME
SEARCH HIM BEAUREGARD AND STOP HIS JAW WITH A BULLET QUICK IF HE WAGS
IT AGAIN
HELP BEAUREGARD STONEWALL
THEN THREE OF THEM WITH THE SMALL SPRY LEADER ADJOURNED TO MIKE AND
FELL TO SEARCHING HIM
I WAS SO EXCITED THAT MY LAWLESS FANCY TORTURED
ME TO ASK MY TWO MEN ALL MANNER OF FACETIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR REBEL
BROTHER GENERALS OF THE SOUTH BUT CONSIDERING THE ORDER THEY HAD
RECEIVED IT WAS BUT COMMON PRUDENCE TO KEEP STILL
WHEN EVERYTHING HAD
BEEN TAKEN FROM ME WATCH MONEY AND A MULTITUDE OF TRIFLES OF SMALL
VALUE I SUPPOSED I WAS FREE AND FORTHWITH PUT MY COLD HANDS INTO MY
EMPTY POCKETS AND BEGAN AN INOFFENSIVE JIG TO WARM MY FEET AND STIR UP
SOME LATENT COURAGE BUT INSTANTLY ALL PISTOLS WERE AT MY HEAD AND THE
ORDER CAME AGAIN
THEY STOOD MIKE UP ALONGSIDE OF ME WITH STRICT ORDERS TO KEEP HIS HANDS
ABOVE HIS HEAD TOO AND THEN THE CHIEF HIGHWAYMAN SAID
BEAUREGARD HIDE BEHIND THAT BOULDER PHIL SHERIDAN YOU HIDE BEHIND
THAT OTHER ONE STONEWALL JACKSON PUT YOURSELF BEHIND THAT SAGE BUSH
THERE
KEEP YOUR PISTOLS BEARING ON THESE FELLOWS AND IF THEY TAKE DOWN
THEIR HANDS WITHIN TEN MINUTES OR MOVE A SINGLE PEG LET THEM HAVE IT
THEN THREE DISAPPEARED IN THE GLOOM TOWARD THE SEVERAL AMBUSHES AND THE
OTHER THREE DISAPPEARED DOWN THE ROAD TOWARD VIRGINIA
IT WAS DEPRESSINGLY STILL AND MISERABLY COLD
NOW THIS WHOLE THING WAS
A PRACTICAL JOKE AND THE ROBBERS WERE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF OURS IN
DISGUISE AND TWENTY MORE LAY HIDDEN WITHIN TEN FEET OF US DURING THE
WHOLE OPERATION LISTENING
MIKE KNEW ALL THIS AND WAS IN THE JOKE BUT
I SUSPECTED NOTHING OF IT
TO ME IT WAS MOST UNCOMFORTABLY GENUINE
WHEN WE HAD STOOD THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FIVE MINUTES LIKE A
COUPLE OF IDIOTS WITH OUR HANDS ALOFT FREEZING TO DEATH BY INCHES
MIKE'S INTEREST IN THE JOKE BEGAN TO WANE
HE SAID
THE TIME'S UP NOW AINT IT
NO YOU KEEP STILL
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES WITH THESE BLOODY
SAVAGES
PRESENTLY MIKE SAID
NOW THE TIME'S UP ANYWAY
I'M FREEZING
WELL FREEZE
BETTER FREEZE THAN CARRY YOUR BRAINS HOME IN A BASKET
MAYBE THE TIME IS UP BUT HOW DO WE KNOW GOT NO WATCH TO TELL BY
I MEAN TO GIVE THEM GOOD MEASURE
I CALCULATE TO STAND HERE FIFTEEN
MINUTES OR DIE
DON'T YOU MOVE
SO WITHOUT KNOWING IT I WAS MAKING ONE JOKER VERY SICK OF HIS CONTRACT
WHEN WE TOOK OUR ARMS DOWN AT LAST THEY WERE ACHING WITH COLD AND
FATIGUE AND WHEN WE WENT SNEAKING OFF THE DREAD I WAS IN THAT THE TIME
MIGHT NOT YET BE UP AND THAT WE WOULD FEEL BULLETS IN A MOMENT WAS NOT
SUFFICIENT TO DRAW ALL MY ATTENTION FROM THE MISERY THAT RACKED MY
STIFFENED BODY
THE JOKE OF THESE HIGHWAYMAN FRIENDS OF OURS WAS MAINLY A JOKE UPON
THEMSELVES FOR THEY HAD WAITED FOR ME ON THE COLD HILL TOP TWO FULL
HOURS BEFORE I CAME AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUN IN THAT THEY WERE SO
CHILLED THAT IT TOOK THEM A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO GET WARM AGAIN
MOREOVER
I NEVER HAD A THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD KILL ME TO GET MONEY WHICH IT WAS
SO PERFECTLY EASY TO GET WITHOUT ANY SUCH FOLLY AND SO THEY DID NOT
REALLY FRIGHTEN ME BAD ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR ENJOYMENT WORTH THE TROUBLE
THEY HAD TAKEN
I WAS ONLY AFRAID THAT THEIR WEAPONS WOULD GO OFF
ACCIDENTALLY
THEIR VERY NUMBERS INSPIRED ME WITH CONFIDENCE THAT NO
BLOOD WOULD BE INTENTIONALLY SPILLED
THEY WERE NOT SMART THEY OUGHT TO
HAVE SENT ONLY ONE HIGHWAYMAN WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED SHOT GUN IF THEY
DESIRED TO SEE THE AUTHOR OF THIS VOLUME CLIMB A TREE
HOWEVER I SUPPOSE THAT IN THE LONG RUN I GOT THE LARGEST SHARE OF THE
JOKE AT LAST AND IN A SHAPE NOT FORESEEN BY THE HIGHWAYMEN FOR THE
CHILLY EXPOSURE ON THE DIVIDE WHILE I WAS IN A PERSPIRATION GAVE ME A
COLD WHICH DEVELOPED ITSELF INTO A TROUBLESOME DISEASE AND KEPT MY HANDS
IDLE SOME THREE MONTHS BESIDES COSTING ME QUITE A SUM IN DOCTOR'S BILLS
SINCE THEN I PLAY NO PRACTICAL JOKES ON PEOPLE AND GENERALLY LOSE MY
TEMPER WHEN ONE IS PLAYED UPON ME
WHEN I RETURNED TO SAN FRANCISCO I PROJECTED A PLEASURE JOURNEY TO JAPAN
AND THENCE WESTWARD AROUND THE WORLD BUT A DESIRE TO SEE HOME AGAIN
CHANGED MY MIND AND I TOOK A BERTH IN THE STEAMSHIP BADE GOOD BYE TO
THE FRIENDLIEST LAND AND LIVEST HEARTIEST COMMUNITY ON OUR CONTINENT
AND CAME BY THE WAY OF THE ISTHMUS TO NEW YORK A TRIP THAT WAS NOT MUCH
OF A PIC NIC EXCURSION FOR THE CHOLERA BROKE OUT AMONG US ON THE PASSAGE
AND WE BURIED TWO OR THREE BODIES AT SEA EVERY DAY
I FOUND HOME A
DREARY PLACE AFTER MY LONG ABSENCE FOR HALF THE CHILDREN I HAD KNOWN
WERE NOW WEARING WHISKERS OR WATERFALLS AND FEW OF THE GROWN PEOPLE I
HAD BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH REMAINED AT THEIR HEARTHSTONES PROSPEROUS AND
HAPPY SOME OF THEM HAD WANDERED TO OTHER SCENES SOME WERE IN JAIL AND
THE REST HAD BEEN HANGED
THESE CHANGES TOUCHED ME DEEPLY AND I WENT
AWAY AND JOINED THE FAMOUS QUAKER CITY EUROPEAN EXCURSION AND CARRIED MY
TEARS TO FOREIGN LANDS
THUS AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF VICISSITUDES ENDED A PLEASURE TRIP TO THE
SILVER MINES OF NEVADA WHICH HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN INTENDED TO OCCUPY ONLY
THREE MONTHS
HOWEVER I USUALLY MISS MY CALCULATIONS FURTHER THAN THAT
MORAL
IF THE READER THINKS HE IS DONE NOW AND THAT THIS BOOK HAS NO MORAL TO
IT HE IS IN ERROR
THE MORAL OF IT IS THIS IF YOU ARE OF ANY ACCOUNT
STAY AT HOME AND MAKE YOUR WAY BY FAITHFUL DILIGENCE BUT IF YOU ARE NO
ACCOUNT GO AWAY FROM HOME AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO WORK WHETHER YOU
WANT TO OR NOT
THUS YOU BECOME A BLESSING TO YOUR FRIENDS BY CEASING TO
BE A NUISANCE TO THEM IF THE PEOPLE YOU GO AMONG SUFFER BY THE
OPERATION
APPENDIX
A
BRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY
MORMONISM IS ONLY ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD BUT ITS CAREER HAS BEEN FULL OF
STIR AND ADVENTURE FROM THE BEGINNING AND IS LIKELY TO REMAIN SO TO THE
END
ITS ADHERENTS HAVE BEEN HUNTED AND HOUNDED FROM ONE END OF THE
COUNTRY TO THE OTHER AND THE RESULT IS THAT FOR YEARS THEY HAVE HATED
ALL GENTILES INDISCRIMINATELY AND WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
JOSEPH SMITH
THE FINDER OF THE BOOK OF MORMON AND FOUNDER OF THE RELIGION WAS DRIVEN
FROM STATE TO STATE WITH HIS MYSTERIOUS COPPERPLATES AND THE MIRACULOUS
STONES HE READ THEIR INSCRIPTIONS WITH
FINALLY HE INSTITUTED HIS
CHURCH IN OHIO AND BRIGHAM YOUNG JOINED IT
THE NEIGHBORS BEGAN TO
PERSECUTE AND APOSTASY COMMENCED
BRIGHAM HELD TO THE FAITH AND WORKED
HARD
HE ARRESTED DESERTION
HE DID MORE HE ADDED CONVERTS IN THE
MIDST OF THE TROUBLE
HE ROSE IN FAVOR AND IMPORTANCE WITH THE BRETHREN
HE WAS MADE ONE OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES OF THE CHURCH
HE SHORTLY FOUGHT
HIS WAY TO A HIGHER POST AND A MORE POWERFUL PRESIDENT OF THE TWELVE
THE NEIGHBORS ROSE UP AND DROVE THE MORMONS OUT OF OHIO AND THEY SETTLED
IN MISSOURI
BRIGHAM WENT WITH THEM
THE MISSOURIANS DROVE THEM OUT AND
THEY RETREATED TO NAUVOO ILLINOIS
THEY PROSPERED THERE AND BUILT A
TEMPLE WHICH MADE SOME PRETENSIONS TO ARCHITECTURAL GRACE AND ACHIEVED
SOME CELEBRITY IN A SECTION OF COUNTRY WHERE A BRICK COURT HOUSE WITH A
TIN DOME AND A CUPOLA ON IT WAS CONTEMPLATED WITH REVERENTIAL AWE
BUT THE MORMONS WERE BADGERED AND HARRIED AGAIN BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
ALL THE PROCLAMATIONS JOSEPH SMITH COULD ISSUE DENOUNCING POLYGAMY AND
REPUDIATING IT AS UTTERLY ANTI MORMON WERE OF NO AVAIL THE PEOPLE OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MISSISSIPPI CLAIMED THAT POLYGAMY WAS
PRACTISED BY THE MORMONS AND NOT ONLY POLYGAMY BUT A LITTLE OF
EVERYTHING THAT WAS BAD
BRIGHAM RETURNED FROM A MISSION TO ENGLAND
WHERE HE HAD ESTABLISHED A MORMON NEWSPAPER AND HE BROUGHT BACK WITH HIM
SEVERAL HUNDRED CONVERTS TO HIS PREACHING
HIS INFLUENCE AMONG THE
BRETHREN AUGMENTED WITH EVERY MOVE HE MADE
FINALLY NAUVOO WAS INVADED
BY THE MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS GENTILES AND JOSEPH SMITH KILLED
A MORMON
NAMED RIGDON ASSUMED THE PRESIDENCY OF THE MORMON CHURCH AND GOVERNMENT
IN SMITH'S PLACE AND EVEN TRIED HIS HAND AT A PROPHECY OR TWO
BUT A
GREATER THAN HE WAS AT HAND
BRIGHAM SEIZED THE ADVANTAGE OF THE HOUR
AND WITHOUT OTHER AUTHORITY THAN SUPERIOR BRAIN AND NERVE AND WILL
HURLED RIGDON FROM HIS HIGH PLACE AND OCCUPIED IT HIMSELF
HE DID MORE
HE LAUNCHED AN ELABORATE CURSE AT RIGDON AND HIS DISCIPLES AND HE
PRONOUNCED RIGDON'S PROPHECIES EMANATIONS FROM THE DEVIL AND ENDED BY
HANDING THE FALSE PROPHET OVER TO THE BUFFETINGS OF SATAN FOR A THOUSAND
YEARS PROBABLY THE LONGEST TERM EVER INFLICTED IN ILLINOIS
THE PEOPLE
RECOGNIZED THEIR MASTER
THEY STRAIGHTWAY ELECTED BRIGHAM YOUNG
PRESIDENT BY A PRODIGIOUS MAJORITY AND HAVE NEVER FALTERED IN THEIR
DEVOTION TO HIM FROM THAT DAY TO THIS
BRIGHAM HAD FORECAST A QUALITY
WHICH NO OTHER PROMINENT MORMON HAS PROBABLY EVER POSSESSED
HE RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS BETTER TO MOVE TO THE WILDERNESS THAN BE MOVED
BY HIS COMMAND THE PEOPLE GATHERED TOGETHER THEIR MEAGRE EFFECTS TURNED
THEIR BACKS UPON THEIR HOMES AND THEIR FACES TOWARD THE WILDERNESS AND
ON A BITTER NIGHT IN FEBRUARY FILED IN SORROWFUL PROCESSION ACROSS THE
FROZEN MISSISSIPPI LIGHTED ON THEIR WAY BY THE GLARE FROM THEIR BURNING
TEMPLE WHOSE SACRED FURNITURE THEIR OWN HANDS HAD FIRED THEY CAMPED
SEVERAL DAYS AFTERWARD ON THE WESTERN VERGE OF IOWA AND POVERTY WANT
HUNGER COLD SICKNESS GRIEF AND PERSECUTION DID THEIR WORK AND MANY
SUCCUMBED AND DIED MARTYRS FAIR AND TRUE WHATEVER ELSE THEY MIGHT HAVE
BEEN
TWO YEARS THE REMNANT REMAINED THERE WHILE BRIGHAM AND A SMALL
PARTY CROSSED THE COUNTRY AND FOUNDED GREAT SALT LAKE CITY PURPOSELY
CHOOSING A LAND WHICH WAS OUTSIDE THE OWNERSHIP AND JURISDICTION OF THE
HATED AMERICAN NATION
NOTE THAT
THIS WAS IN 1847
BRIGHAM MOVED HIS
PEOPLE THERE AND GOT THEM SETTLED JUST IN TIME TO SEE DISASTER FALL
AGAIN
FOR THE WAR CLOSED AND MEXICO CEDED BRIGHAM'S REFUGE TO THE
ENEMY THE UNITED STATES IN 1849 THE MORMONS ORGANIZED A FREE AND
INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT AND ERECTED THE STATE OF DESERET WITH BRIGHAM
YOUNG AS ITS HEAD
BUT THE VERY NEXT YEAR CONGRESS DELIBERATELY SNUBBED
IT AND CREATED THE TERRITORY OF UTAH OUT OF THE SAME ACCUMULATION OF
MOUNTAINS SAGE BRUSH ALKALI AND GENERAL DESOLATION BUT MADE BRIGHAM
GOVERNOR OF IT
THEN FOR YEARS THE ENORMOUS MIGRATION ACROSS THE PLAINS
TO CALIFORNIA POURED THROUGH THE LAND OF THE MORMONS AND YET THE CHURCH
REMAINED STAUNCH AND TRUE TO ITS LORD AND MASTER
NEITHER HUNGER
THIRST POVERTY GRIEF HATRED CONTEMPT NOR PERSECUTION COULD DRIVE THE
MORMONS FROM THEIR FAITH OR THEIR ALLEGIANCE AND EVEN THE THIRST FOR
GOLD WHICH GLEANED THE FLOWER OF THE YOUTH AND STRENGTH OF MANY NATIONS
WAS NOT ABLE TO ENTICE THEM THAT WAS THE FINAL TEST
AN EXPERIMENT
THAT COULD SURVIVE THAT WAS AN EXPERIMENT WITH SOME SUBSTANCE TO IT
SOMEWHERE
GREAT SALT LAKE CITY THROVE FINELY AND SO DID UTAH
ONE OF THE LAST
THINGS WHICH BRIGHAM YOUNG HAD DONE BEFORE LEAVING IOWA WAS TO APPEAR IN
THE PULPIT DRESSED TO PERSONATE THE WORSHIPPED AND LAMENTED PROPHET
SMITH AND CONFER THE PROPHETIC SUCCESSION WITH ALL ITS DIGNITIES
EMOLUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES UPON PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG THE PEOPLE
ACCEPTED THE PIOUS FRAUD WITH THE MADDEST ENTHUSIASM AND BRIGHAM'S POWER
WAS SEALED AND SECURED FOR ALL TIME
WITHIN FIVE YEARS AFTERWARD HE
OPENLY ADDED POLYGAMY TO THE TENETS OF THE CHURCH BY AUTHORITY OF A
REVELATION WHICH HE PRETENDED HAD BEEN RECEIVED NINE YEARS BEFORE BY
JOSEPH SMITH ALBEIT JOSEPH IS AMPLY ON RECORD AS DENOUNCING POLYGAMY TO
THE DAY OF HIS DEATH
NOW WAS BRIGHAM BECOME A SECOND ANDREW JOHNSON IN THE SMALL BEGINNING AND
STEADY PROGRESS OF HIS OFFICIAL GRANDEUR
HE HAD SERVED SUCCESSIVELY AS
A DISCIPLE IN THE RANKS HOME MISSIONARY FOREIGN MISSIONARY EDITOR AND
PUBLISHER APOSTLE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF APOSTLES PRESIDENT OF ALL
MORMONDOM CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL SUCCESSOR TO THE GREAT JOSEPH BY THE
WILL OF HEAVEN PROPHET SEER REVELATOR THERE WAS BUT ONE
DIGNITY HIGHER WHICH HE COULD ASPIRE TO AND HE REACHED OUT MODESTLY AND
TOOK THAT HE PROCLAIMED HIMSELF A GOD
HE CLAIMS THAT HE IS TO HAVE A HEAVEN OF HIS OWN HEREAFTER AND THAT HE
WILL BE ITS GOD AND HIS WIVES AND CHILDREN ITS GODDESSES PRINCES AND
PRINCESSES
INTO IT ALL FAITHFUL MORMONS WILL BE ADMITTED WITH THEIR
FAMILIES AND WILL TAKE RANK AND CONSEQUENCE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF
THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN
IF A DISCIPLE DIES BEFORE HE HAS HAD TIME TO
ACCUMULATE ENOUGH WIVES AND CHILDREN TO ENABLE HIM TO BE RESPECTABLE IN
THE NEXT WORLD ANY FRIEND CAN MARRY A FEW WIVES AND RAISE A FEW CHILDREN
FOR HIM AFTER HE IS DEAD AND THEY ARE DULY CREDITED TO HIS ACCOUNT AND
HIS HEAVENLY STATUS ADVANCED ACCORDINGLY
LET IT BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE MORMONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
IGNORANT SIMPLE OF AN INFERIOR ORDER OF INTELLECT UNACQUAINTED WITH
THE WORLD AND ITS WAYS AND LET IT BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE WIVES OF
THESE MORMONS ARE NECESSARILY AFTER THE SAME PATTERN AND THEIR CHILDREN
LIKELY TO BE FIT REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH A CONJUNCTION AND THEN LET IT
BE REMEMBERED THAT FOR FORTY YEARS THESE CREATURES HAVE BEEN DRIVEN
DRIVEN DRIVEN RELENTLESSLY AND MOBBED BEATEN AND SHOT DOWN CURSED
DESPISED EXPATRIATED BANISHED TO A REMOTE DESERT WHITHER THEY
JOURNEYED GAUNT WITH FAMINE AND DISEASE DISTURBING THE ANCIENT SOLITUDES
WITH THEIR LAMENTATIONS AND MARKING THE LONG WAY WITH GRAVES OF THEIR
DEAD AND ALL BECAUSE THEY WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO LIVE AND WORSHIP GOD IN
THE WAY WHICH THEY BELIEVED WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS TO BE THE
TRUE ONE
LET ALL THESE THINGS BE BORNE IN MIND AND THEN IT WILL NOT BE
HARD TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DEATHLESS HATRED WHICH THE MORMONS BEAR OUR
PEOPLE AND OUR GOVERNMENT
THAT HATRED HAS FED FAT ITS ANCIENT GRUDGE EVER SINCE MORMON UTAH
DEVELOPED INTO A SELF SUPPORTING REALM AND THE CHURCH WAXED RICH AND
STRONG
BRIGHAM AS TERRITORIAL GOVERNOR MADE IT PLAIN THAT MORMONDOM WAS
FOR THE MORMONS
THE UNITED STATES TRIED TO RECTIFY ALL THAT BY
APPOINTING TERRITORIAL OFFICERS FROM NEW ENGLAND AND OTHER ANTI MORMON
LOCALITIES BUT BRIGHAM PREPARED TO MAKE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO HIS
DOMINIONS DIFFICULT
THREE THOUSAND UNITED STATES TROOPS HAD TO GO
ACROSS THE PLAINS AND PUT THESE GENTLEMEN IN OFFICE
AND AFTER THEY WERE
IN OFFICE THEY WERE AS HELPLESS AS SO MANY STONE IMAGES
THEY MADE LAWS
WHICH NOBODY MINDED AND WHICH COULD NOT BE EXECUTED
THE FEDERAL JUDGES
OPENED COURT IN A LAND FILLED WITH CRIME AND VIOLENCE AND SAT AS HOLIDAY
SPECTACLES FOR INSOLENT CROWDS TO GAPE AT FOR THERE WAS NOTHING TO TRY
NOTHING TO DO NOTHING ON THE DOCKETS AND IF A GENTILE BROUGHT A SUIT
THE MORMON JURY WOULD DO JUST AS IT PLEASED ABOUT BRINGING IN A VERDICT
AND WHEN THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT WAS RENDERED NO MORMON CARED FOR IT
AND NO OFFICER COULD EXECUTE IT
OUR PRESIDENTS SHIPPED ONE CARGO OF
OFFICIALS AFTER ANOTHER TO UTAH BUT THE RESULT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME THEY
SAT IN A BLIGHT FOR AWHILE THEY FAIRLY FEASTED ON SCOWLS AND INSULTS DAY
BY DAY THEY SAW EVERY ATTEMPT TO DO THEIR OFFICIAL DUTIES FIND ITS
REWARD IN DARKER AND DARKER LOOKS AND IN SECRET THREATS AND WARNINGS OF
A MORE AND MORE DISMAL NATURE AND AT LAST THEY EITHER SUCCUMBED AND
BECAME DESPISED TOOLS AND TOYS OF THE MORMONS OR GOT SCARED AND
DISCOMFORTED BEYOND ALL ENDURANCE AND LEFT THE TERRITORY
IF A BRAVE
OFFICER KEPT ON COURAGEOUSLY TILL HIS PLUCK WAS PROVEN SOME PLIANT
BUCHANAN OR PIERCE WOULD REMOVE HIM AND APPOINT A STICK IN HIS PLACE
IN 1857 GENERAL HARNEY CAME VERY NEAR BEING APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF UTAH
AND SO IT CAME VERY NEAR BEING HARNEY GOVERNOR AND CRADLEBAUGH JUDGE
TWO MEN WHO NEVER HAD ANY IDEA OF FEAR FURTHER THAN THE SORT OF MURKY
COMPREHENSION OF IT WHICH THEY WERE ENABLED TO GATHER FROM THE
DICTIONARY
SIMPLY IF FOR NOTHING ELSE FOR THE VARIETY THEY WOULD HAVE
MADE IN A RATHER MONOTONOUS HISTORY OF FEDERAL SERVILITY AND
HELPLESSNESS IT IS A PITY THEY WERE NOT FATED TO HOLD OFFICE TOGETHER IN
UTAH
UP TO THE DATE OF OUR VISIT TO UTAH SUCH HAD BEEN THE TERRITORIAL
RECORD
THE TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED THERE HAD BEEN A HOPELESS
FAILURE AND BRIGHAM YOUNG WAS THE ONLY REAL POWER IN THE LAND
HE WAS
AN ABSOLUTE MONARCH A MONARCH WHO DEFIED OUR PRESIDENT A MONARCH WHO
LAUGHED AT OUR ARMIES WHEN THEY CAMPED ABOUT HIS CAPITAL A MONARCH WHO
RECEIVED WITHOUT EMOTION THE NEWS THAT THE AUGUST CONGRESS OF THE UNITED
STATES HAD ENACTED A SOLEMN LAW AGAINST POLYGAMY AND THEN WENT FORTH
CALMLY AND MARRIED TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY MORE WIVES
B
THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE
THE PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE MORMONS SUFFERED SO LONG AND WHICH THEY
CONSIDER THEY STILL SUFFER IN NOT BEING ALLOWED TO GOVERN THEMSELVES
THEY HAVE ENDEAVORED AND ARE STILL ENDEAVORING TO REPAY
THE NOW ALMOST
FORGOTTEN MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE WAS THEIR WORK
IT WAS VERY FAMOUS
IN ITS DAY
THE WHOLE UNITED STATES RANG WITH ITS HORRORS
A FEW ITEMS
WILL REFRESH THE READER'S MEMORY
A GREAT EMIGRANT TRAIN FROM MISSOURI
AND ARKANSAS PASSED THROUGH SALT LAKE CITY AND A FEW DISAFFECTED MORMONS
JOINED IT FOR THE SAKE OF THE STRONG PROTECTION IT AFFORDED FOR THEIR
ESCAPE
IN THAT MATTER LAY SUFFICIENT CAUSE FOR HOT RETALIATION BY THE
MORMON CHIEFS
BESIDES THESE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE OR ONE HUNDRED
AND FIFTY UNSUSPECTING EMIGRANTS BEING IN PART FROM ARKANSAS WHERE A
NOTED MORMON MISSIONARY HAD LATELY BEEN KILLED AND IN PART FROM
MISSOURI A STATE REMEMBERED WITH EXECRATIONS AS A BITTER PERSECUTOR OF
THE SAINTS WHEN THEY WERE FEW AND POOR AND FRIENDLESS HERE WERE
SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL GROUNDS FOR LACK OF LOVE FOR THESE WAYFARERS
AND FINALLY THIS TRAIN WAS RICH VERY RICH IN CATTLE HORSES MULES AND
OTHER PROPERTY AND HOW COULD THE MORMONS CONSISTENTLY KEEP UP THEIR
COVETED RESEMBLANCE TO THE ISRAELITISH TRIBES AND NOT SEIZE THE SPOIL
OF AN ENEMY WHEN THE LORD HAD SO MANIFESTLY DELIVERED IT INTO THEIR
HAND
WHEREFORE ACCORDING TO MRS
C
V
WAITE'S ENTERTAINING BOOK THE MORMON
PROPHET IT TRANSPIRED THAT
A 'REVELATION' FROM BRIGHAM YOUNG AS GREAT GRAND ARCHEE OR GOD WAS
DISPATCHED TO PRESIDENT J
C
HAIGHT BISHOP HIGBEE AND J
D
LEE
ADOPTED SON OF BRIGHAM COMMANDING THEM TO RAISE ALL THE FORCES THEY
COULD MUSTER AND TRUST FOLLOW THOSE CURSED GENTILES SO READ THE
REVELATION ATTACK THEM DISGUISED AS INDIANS AND WITH THE ARROWS OF THE
ALMIGHTY MAKE A CLEAN SWEEP OF THEM AND LEAVE NONE TO TELL THE TALE AND
IF THEY NEEDED ANY ASSISTANCE THEY WERE COMMANDED TO HIRE THE INDIANS AS
THEIR ALLIES PROMISING THEM A SHARE OF THE BOOTY
THEY WERE TO BE
NEITHER SLOTHFUL NOR NEGLIGENT IN THEIR DUTY AND TO BE PUNCTUAL IN
SENDING THE TEAMS BACK TO HIM BEFORE WINTER SET IN FOR THIS WAS THE
MANDATE OF ALMIGHTY GOD
THE COMMAND OF THE REVELATION WAS FAITHFULLY OBEYED
A LARGE PARTY OF
MORMONS PAINTED AND TRICKED OUT AS INDIANS OVERTOOK THE TRAIN OF
EMIGRANT WAGONS SOME THREE HUNDRED MILES SOUTH OF SALT LAKE CITY AND
MADE AN ATTACK
BUT THE EMIGRANTS THREW UP EARTHWORKS MADE FORTRESSES
OF THEIR WAGONS AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES GALLANTLY AND SUCCESSFULLY FOR
FIVE DAYS YOUR MISSOURI OR ARKANSAS GENTLEMAN IS NOT MUCH AFRAID OF THE
SORT OF SCURVY APOLOGIES FOR INDIANS WHICH THE SOUTHERN PART OF UTAH
AFFORDS
HE WOULD STAND UP AND FIGHT FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM
AT THE END OF THE FIVE DAYS THE MORMONS TRIED MILITARY STRATEGY
THEY
RETIRED TO THE UPPER END OF THE MEADOWS RESUMED CIVILIZED APPAREL
WASHED OFF THEIR PAINT AND THEN HEAVILY ARMED DROVE DOWN IN WAGONS TO
THE BELEAGUERED EMIGRANTS BEARING A FLAG OF TRUCE WHEN THE EMIGRANTS
SAW WHITE MEN COMING THEY THREW DOWN THEIR GUNS AND WELCOMED THEM WITH
CHEER AFTER CHEER AND ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF THE POETRY OF IT NO DOUBT
THEY LIFTED A LITTLE CHILD ALOFT DRESSED IN WHITE IN ANSWER TO THE FLAG
OF TRUCE
THE LEADERS OF THE TIMELY WHITE DELIVERERS WERE PRESIDENT HAIGHT AND
BISHOP JOHN D
LEE OF THE MORMON CHURCH
MR
CRADLEBAUGH WHO SERVED A
TERM AS A FEDERAL JUDGE IN UTAH AND AFTERWARD WAS SENT TO CONGRESS FROM
NEVADA TELLS IN A SPEECH DELIVERED IN CONGRESS HOW THESE LEADERS NEXT
PROCEEDED
THEY PROFESSED TO BE ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE INDIANS AND REPRESENTED
THEM AS BEING VERY MAD
THEY ALSO PROPOSED TO INTERCEDE AND SETTLE THE
MATTER WITH THE INDIANS
AFTER SEVERAL HOURS PARLEY THEY HAVING
APPARENTLY VISITED THE INDIANS GAVE THE ULTIMATUM OF THE SAVAGES
WHICH WAS THAT THE EMIGRANTS SHOULD MARCH OUT OF THEIR CAMP LEAVING
EVERYTHING BEHIND THEM EVEN THEIR GUNS
IT WAS PROMISED BY THE MORMON
BISHOPS THAT THEY WOULD BRING A FORCE AND GUARD THE EMIGRANTS BACK TO THE
SETTLEMENTS
THE TERMS WERE AGREED TO THE EMIGRANTS BEING DESIROUS OF
SAVING THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES
THE MORMONS RETIRED AND
SUBSEQUENTLY APPEARED WITH THIRTY OR FORTY ARMED MEN
THE EMIGRANTS WERE
MARCHED OUT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN FRONT AND THE MEN BEHIND THE
MORMON GUARD BEING IN THE REAR
WHEN THEY HAD MARCHED IN THIS WAY ABOUT
A MILE AT A GIVEN SIGNAL THE SLAUGHTER COMMENCED
THE MEN WERE ALMOST
ALL SHOT DOWN AT THE FIRST FIRE FROM THE GUARD
TWO ONLY ESCAPED WHO
FLED TO THE DESERT AND WERE FOLLOWED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES BEFORE
THEY WERE OVERTAKEN AND SLAUGHTERED
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN RAN ON TWO
OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER WHEN THEY WERE OVERTAKEN AND WITH THE AID
OF THE INDIANS THEY WERE SLAUGHTERED
SEVENTEEN INDIVIDUALS ONLY OF ALL
THE EMIGRANT PARTY WERE SPARED AND THEY WERE LITTLE CHILDREN THE
ELDEST OF THEM BEING ONLY SEVEN YEARS OLD
THUS ON THE 10TH DAY OF
SEPTEMBER 1857 WAS CONSUMMATED ONE OF THE MOST CRUEL COWARDLY AND
BLOODY MURDERS KNOWN IN OUR HISTORY
THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BUTCHERED BY THE MORMONS ON THIS OCCASION WAS ONE
HUNDRED AND TWENTY
WITH UNHEARD OF TEMERITY JUDGE CRADLEBAUGH OPENED HIS COURT AND PROCEEDED
TO MAKE MORMONDOM ANSWER FOR THE MASSACRE
AND WHAT A SPECTACLE IT MUST
HAVE BEEN TO SEE THIS GRIM VETERAN SOLITARY AND ALONE IN HIS PRIDE AND
HIS PLUCK GLOWERING DOWN ON HIS MORMON JURY AND MORMON AUDITORY
DERIDING THEM BY TURNS AND BY TURNS BREATHING THREATENINGS AND
SLAUGHTER
AN EDITORIAL IN THE TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE OF THAT DAY SAYS OF HIM AND OF
THE OCCASION
HE SPOKE AND ACTED WITH THE FEARLESSNESS AND RESOLUTION OF A JACKSON
BUT THE JURY FAILED TO INDICT OR EVEN REPORT ON THE CHARGES WHILE
THREATS OF VIOLENCE WERE HEARD IN EVERY QUARTER AND AN ATTACK ON THE
U S
TROOPS INTIMATED IF HE PERSISTED IN HIS COURSE
FINDING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE WITH THE JURIES THEY WERE DISCHARGED
WITH A SCATHING REBUKE FROM THE JUDGE
AND THEN SITTING AS A COMMITTING
MAGISTRATE HE COMMENCED HIS TASK ALONE
HE EXAMINED WITNESSES MADE
ARRESTS IN EVERY QUARTER AND CREATED A CONSTERNATION IN THE CAMPS OF THE
SAINTS GREATER THAN ANY THEY HAD EVER WITNESSED BEFORE SINCE MORMONDOM
WAS BORN
AT LAST ACCOUNTS TERRIFIED ELDERS AND BISHOPS WERE DECAMPING
TO SAVE THEIR NECKS AND DEVELOPMENTS OF THE MOST STARLING CHARACTER WERE
BEING MADE IMPLICATING THE HIGHEST CHURCH DIGNITARIES IN THE MANY
MURDERS AND ROBBERIES COMMITTED UPON THE GENTILES DURING THE PAST EIGHT
YEARS
HAD HARNEY BEEN GOVERNOR CRADLEBAUGH WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN HIS
WORK AND THE ABSOLUTE PROOFS ADDUCED BY HIM OF MORMON GUILT IN THIS
MASSACRE AND IN A NUMBER OF PREVIOUS MURDERS WOULD HAVE CONFERRED
GRATUITOUS COFFINS UPON CERTAIN CITIZENS TOGETHER WITH OCCASION TO USE
THEM
BUT CUMMING WAS THE FEDERAL GOVERNOR AND HE UNDER A CURIOUS
PRETENSE OF IMPARTIALITY SOUGHT TO SCREEN THE MORMONS FROM THE DEMANDS
OF JUSTICE
ON ONE OCCASION HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO PUBLISH HIS
PROTEST AGAINST THE USE OF THE U S
TROOPS IN AID OF CRADLEBAUGH'S
PROCEEDINGS
MRS
C
V
WAITE CLOSES HER INTERESTING DETAIL OF THE GREAT MASSACRE WITH
THE FOLLOWING REMARK AND ACCOMPANYING SUMMARY OF THE TESTIMONY AND THE
SUMMARY IS CONCISE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THOSE WHO MAY STILL BE DISPOSED TO DOUBT THE GUILT OF
YOUNG AND HIS MORMONS IN THIS TRANSACTION THE TESTIMONY IS HERE COLLATED
AND CIRCUMSTANCES GIVEN WHICH GO NOT MERELY TO IMPLICATE BUT TO FASTEN
CONVICTION UPON THEM BY 'CONFIRMATIONS STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
1
THE EVIDENCE OF MORMONS THEMSELVES ENGAGED IN THE AFFAIR AS SHOWN
BY THE STATEMENTS OF JUDGE CRADLEBAUGH AND DEPUTY U S
MARSHALL RODGERS
2
THE FAILURE OF BRIGHAM YOUNG TO EMBODY ANY ACCOUNT OF IT IN HIS
REPORT AS SUPERINTENDENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS
ALSO HIS FAILURE TO MAKE ANY
ALLUSION TO IT WHATEVER FROM THE PULPIT UNTIL SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE
OCCURRENCE
3
THE FLIGHT TO THE MOUNTAINS OF MEN HIGH IN AUTHORITY IN THE MORMON
CHURCH AND STATE WHEN THIS AFFAIR WAS BROUGHT TO THE ORDEAL OF A
JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION
4
THE FAILURE OF THE DESERET NEWS THE CHURCH ORGAN AND THE ONLY
PAPER THEN PUBLISHED IN THE TERRITORY TO NOTICE THE MASSACRE UNTIL
SEVERAL MONTHS AFTERWARD AND THEN ONLY TO DENY THAT MORMONS WERE ENGAGED
IN IT
5
THE TESTIMONY OF THE CHILDREN SAVED FROM THE MASSACRE
6
THE CHILDREN AND THE PROPERTY OF THE EMIGRANTS FOUND IN POSSESSION
OF THE MORMONS AND THAT POSSESSION TRACED BACK TO THE VERY DAY AFTER THE
MASSACRE
7
THE STATEMENTS OF INDIANS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SCENE OF THE
MASSACRE THESE STATEMENTS ARE SHOWN NOT ONLY BY CRADLEBAUGH AND
RODGERS BUT BY A NUMBER OF MILITARY OFFICERS AND BY J
FORNEY WHO WAS
IN 1859 SUPERINTENDENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS FOR THE TERRITORY
TO ALL
THESE WERE SUCH STATEMENTS FREELY AND FREQUENTLY MADE BY THE INDIANS
8
THE TESTIMONY OF R
P
CAMPBELL CAPT
2D DRAGOONS WHO WAS SENT IN
THE SPRING OF 1859 TO SANTA CLARA TO PROTECT TRAVELERS ON THE ROAD TO
CALIFORNIA AND TO INQUIRE INTO INDIAN DEPREDATIONS
C
CONCERNING A FRIGHTFUL ASSASSINATION THAT WAS NEVER CONSUMMATED
IF EVER THERE WAS A HARMLESS MAN IT IS CONRAD WIEGAND OF GOLD HILL
NEVADA
IF EVER THERE WAS A GENTLE SPIRIT THAT THOUGHT ITSELF UNFIRED
GUNPOWDER AND LATENT RUIN IT IS CONRAD WIEGAND
IF EVER THERE WAS AN
OYSTER THAT FANCIED ITSELF A WHALE OR A JACK O'LANTERN CONFINED TO A
SWAMP THAT FANCIED ITSELF A PLANET WITH A BILLION MILE ORBIT OR A
SUMMER ZEPHYR THAT DEEMED ITSELF A HURRICANE IT IS CONRAD WIEGAND
THEREFORE WHAT WONDER IS IT THAT WHEN HE SAYS A THING HE THINKS THE
WORLD LISTENS THAT WHEN HE DOES A THING THE WORLD STANDS STILL TO LOOK
AND THAT WHEN HE SUFFERS THERE IS A CONVULSION OF NATURE WHEN I MET
CONRAD HE WAS SUPERINTENDENT OF THE GOLD HILL ASSAY OFFICE AND HE WAS
NOT ONLY ITS SUPERINTENDENT BUT ITS ENTIRE FORCE
AND HE WAS A STREET
PREACHER TOO WITH A MONGREL RELIGION OF HIS OWN INVENTION WHEREBY HE
EXPECTED TO REGENERATE THE UNIVERSE
THIS WAS YEARS AGO
HERE LATTERLY
HE HAS ENTERED JOURNALISM AND HIS JOURNALISM IS WHAT IT MIGHT BE
EXPECTED TO BE COLOSSAL TO EAR BUT PIGMY TO THE EYE
IT IS EXTRAVAGANT
GRANDILOQUENCE CONFINED TO A NEWSPAPER ABOUT THE SIZE OF A DOUBLE LETTER
SHEET
HE DOUBTLESS EDITS SETS THE TYPE AND PRINTS HIS PAPER ALL
ALONE BUT HE DELIGHTS TO SPEAK OF THE CONCERN AS IF IT OCCUPIES A BLOCK
AND EMPLOYS A THOUSAND MEN
SOMETHING LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO CONRAD ASSAILED SEVERAL PEOPLE
MERCILESSLY IN HIS LITTLE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE AND GOT HIMSELF INTO
TROUBLE
STRAIGHTWAY HE AIRS THE AFFAIR IN THE TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE
IN A COMMUNICATION OVER HIS OWN SIGNATURE AND I PROPOSE TO REPRODUCE IT
HERE IN ALL ITS NATIVE SIMPLICITY AND MORE THAN HUMAN CANDOR
LONG AS
IT IS IT IS WELL WORTH READING FOR IT IS THE RICHEST SPECIMEN OF
JOURNALISTIC LITERATURE THE HISTORY OF AMERICA CAN FURNISH PERHAPS
FROM THE TERRITORIAL ENTERPRISE JAN
20 1870
SEEMING PLOT FOR ASSASSINATION MISCARRIED
TO THE EDITOR OF THE ENTERPRISE MONTHS AGO WHEN MR
SUTRO INCIDENTALLY
EXPOSED MINING MANAGEMENT ON THE COMSTOCK AND AMONG OTHERS ROUSED ME TO
PROTEST AGAINST ITS CONTINUANCE IN GREAT KINDNESS YOU WARNED ME THAT ANY
ATTEMPT BY PUBLICATIONS BY PUBLIC MEETINGS AND BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION
AIMED AT THE CORRECTION OF CHRONIC MINING EVILS IN STOREY COUNTY MUST
ENTAIL UPON ME A BUSINESS RUIN B THE BURDEN OF ALL ITS COSTS C
PERSONAL VIOLENCE AND IF MY PURPOSE WERE PERSISTED IN THEN D
ASSASSINATION AND AFTER ALL NOTHING WOULD BE EFFECTED
YOUR PROPHECY FULFILLING
IN LARGE PART AT LEAST YOUR PROPHECIES HAVE BEEN FULFILLED FOR A
ASSAYING WHICH WAS WELL ATTENDED TO IN THE GOLD HILL ASSAY OFFICE OF
WHICH I AM SUPERINTENDENT IN CONSEQUENCE OF MY PUBLICATIONS HAS BEEN
TAKEN ELSEWHERE SO THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE COMPANIES ASSURES ME
WITH NO REASON ASSIGNED OTHER WORK HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY
WITH BUT ONE OR
TWO IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS OUR ASSAY BUSINESS NOW CONSISTS SIMPLY OF THE
GLEANINGS OF THE VICINITY
B THOUGH MY OWN PERSONAL DONATIONS TO THE
PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE ASSOCIATION HAVE ALREADY EXCEEDED 1 500 OUTSIDE OF OUR
OWN NUMBERS WE HAVE RECEIVED IN MONEY LESS THAN 300 AS CONTRIBUTIONS
AND SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR THE JOURNAL
C ON THURSDAY LAST ON THE MAIN
STREET IN GOLD HILL NEAR NOON WITH NEITHER WARNING NOR CAUSE ASSIGNED
BY A POWERFUL BLOW I WAS FELLED TO THE GROUND AND WHILE DOWN I WAS
KICKED BY A MAN WHO IT WOULD SEEM HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT I HAD
SPOKEN DEROGATORILY OF HIM
BY WHOM HE WAS SO INDUCED TO BELIEVE I AM AS
YET UNABLE TO SAY
ON SATURDAY LAST I WAS AGAIN ASSAILED AND BEATEN BY A
MAN WHO FIRST INFORMED ME WHY HE DID SO AND WHO PERSISTED IN MAKING HIS
ASSAULT EVEN AFTER THE ERRONEOUS IMPRESSION UNDER WHICH HE ALSO WAS AT
FIRST LABORING HAD BEEN CLEARLY AND REPEATEDLY POINTED OUT
THIS SAME
MAN AFTER FAILING THROUGH INTIMIDATION TO ELICIT FROM ME THE NAMES OF
OUR EDITORIAL CONTRIBUTORS AGAINST GIVING WHICH HE KNEW ME TO BE
PLEDGED BEAT HIMSELF WEARY UPON ME WITH A RAW HIDE I NOT RESISTING AND
THEN PANTINGLY THREATENED ME WITH PERMANENT DISFIGURING MAYHEM IF EVER
AGAIN I SHOULD INTRODUCE HIS NAME INTO PRINT AND WHO BUT A FEW MINUTES
BEFORE HIS ATTACK UPON ME ASSURED ME THAT THE ONLY REASON I WAS
PERMITTED TO REACH HOME ALIVE ON WEDNESDAY EVENING LAST AT WHICH TIME
THE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE WAS ISSUED WAS THAT HE DEEMS ME ONLY HALF WITTED
AND BE IT REMEMBERED THE VERY NEXT MORNING I WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND KICKED
BY A MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE PREPARED FOR FLIGHT
HE SEES DOOM IMPENDING
WHEN WILL THE CIRCLE JOIN
HOW LONG BEFORE THE WHOLE OF YOUR PROPHECY WILL BE FULFILLED I CANNOT
SAY BUT UNDER THE SHADOW OF SO MUCH FULFILLMENT IN SO SHORT A TIME AND
WITH SUCH THREATS FROM A MAN WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT EXPONENTS
OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MINING RING STARING ME AND THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY
DEFIANTLY IN THE FACE AND POINTING TO A COMPLETION OF YOUR AUGURY DO YOU
BLAME ME FOR FEELING THAT THIS COMMUNICATION IS THE LAST I SHALL EVER
WRITE FOR THE PRESS ESPECIALLY WHEN A SENSE ALIKE OF PERSONAL
SELF RESPECT OF DUTY TO THIS MONEY OPPRESSED AND FEAR RIDDEN COMMUNITY
AND OF AMERICAN FEALTY TO THE SPIRIT OF TRUE LIBERTY ALL COMMAND ME AND
EACH MORE LOUDLY THAN LOVE OF LIFE ITSELF TO DECLARE THE NAME OF THAT
PROMINENT MAN TO BE JOHN B
WINTERS PRESIDENT OF THE YELLOW JACKET
COMPANY A POLITICAL ASPIRANT AND A MILITARY GENERAL THE NAME OF HIS
PARTIALLY DUPED ACCOMPLICE AND ABETTOR IN THIS LAST MARVELOUS ASSAULT IS
NO OTHER THAN PHILIP LYNCH EDITOR AND PROPRIETOR OF THE GOLD HILL NEWS
DESPITE THE INSULT AND WRONG HEAPED UPON ME BY JOHN B
WINTERS ON
SATURDAY AFTERNOON ONLY A GLIMPSE OF WHICH I SHALL BE ABLE TO AFFORD
YOUR READERS SO MUCH DO I DEPLORE CLINCHING BY PUBLICITY A SERIOUS
MISTAKE OF ANY ONE MAN OR WOMAN COMMITTED UNDER NATURAL AND NOT
SELF WROUGHT PASSION IN VIEW OF HIS GREAT APPARENT EXCITEMENT AT THE
TIME AND IN VIEW OF THE ALMOST PERFECT PRIVACY OF THE ASSAULT I AM FAR
FROM SURE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM SPACE FOR REPENTANCE BEFORE
EXPOSING HIM WERE IT NOT THAT HE HIMSELF HAS SO FAR EXPOSED THE MATTER
AS TO MAKE IT THE COMMON TALK OF THE TOWN THAT HE HAS HORSEWHIPPED ME
THAT FACT HAVING BEEN MADE PUBLIC ALL THE FACTS IN CONNECTION NEED TO BE
ALSO OR SILENCE ON MY PART WOULD SEEM MORE THAN SINGULAR AND WITH MANY
WOULD BE PROOF EITHER THAT I WAS CONSCIOUS OF SOME UNWORTHY AIM IN
PUBLISHING THE ARTICLE OR ELSE THAT MY NON COMBATANT PRINCIPLES ARE
BUT A CONVENIENT CLOAK ALIKE OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL COWARDICE
I
THEREFORE SHALL TRY TO PRESENT A GRAPHIC BUT TRUTHFUL PICTURE OF THIS
WHOLE AFFAIR BUT SHALL FORBEAR ALL COMMENTS PRESUMING THAT THE EDITORS
OF OUR OWN JOURNAL IF OTHERS DO NOT WILL SPEAK FREELY AND FITTINGLY
UPON THIS SUBJECT IN OUR NEXT NUMBER WHETHER I SHALL THEN BE DEAD OR
LIVING FOR MY DEATH WILL NOT STOP THOUGH IT MAY SUSPEND THE
PUBLICATION OF THE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE
THE NON COMBATANT STICKS TO
PRINCIPLE BUT TAKES ALONG A FRIEND OR TWO OF A CONVENIENTLY DIFFERENT
STRIPE
THE TRAP SET
ON SATURDAY MORNING JOHN B
WINTERS SENT VERBAL WORD TO THE GOLD HILL
ASSAY OFFICE THAT HE DESIRED TO SEE ME AT THE YELLOW JACKET OFFICE
THOUGH SUCH A REQUEST STRUCK ME AS DECIDEDLY COOL IN VIEW OF HIS OWN
RECENT DISCOURTESIES TO ME THERE ALIKE AS A PUBLISHER AND AS A
STOCKHOLDER IN THE YELLOW JACKET MINE AND THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME MORE
LIKE A SUMMONS THAN THE COURTEOUS REQUEST BY ONE GENTLEMAN TO ANOTHER FOR
A FAVOR HOPING THAT SOME CONFERENCE WITH SHARON LOOKING TO THE
BETTERMENT OF MINING MATTERS IN NEVADA MIGHT ARISE FROM IT I FELT
STRONGLY INCLINED TO OVERLOOK WHAT POSSIBLY WAS SIMPLY AN OVERSIGHT IN
COURTESY
BUT AS THEN IT HAD ONLY BEEN TWO DAYS SINCE I HAD BEEN BRUISED
AND BEATEN UNDER A HASTY AND FALSE APPREHENSION OF FACTS MY CAUTION WAS
SOMEWHAT AROUSED
MOREOVER I REMEMBERED SENSITIVELY HIS CONTEMPTUOUSNESS
OF MANNER TO ME AT MY LAST INTERVIEW IN HIS OFFICE
I THEREFORE FELT IT
NEEDFUL IF I WENT AT ALL TO GO ACCOMPANIED BY A FRIEND WHOM HE WOULD
NOT DARE TO TREAT WITH INCIVILITY AND WHOSE PRESENCE WITH ME MIGHT
SECURE EXEMPTION FROM INSULT
ACCORDINGLY I ASKED A NEIGHBOR TO
ACCOMPANY ME
THE TRAP ALMOST DETECTED
ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT THEN AWARE OF THIS FACT IT WOULD SEEM THAT PREVIOUS
TO MY REQUEST THIS SAME NEIGHBOR HAD HEARD DR
ZABRISKIE STATE PUBLICLY
IN A SALOON THAT MR
WINTERS HAD TOLD HIM HE HAD DECIDED EITHER TO KILL
OR TO HORSEWHIP ME BUT HAD NOT FINALLY DECIDED ON WHICH
MY NEIGHBOR
THEREFORE FELT UNWILLING TO GO DOWN WITH ME UNTIL HE HAD FIRST CALLED ON
MR
WINTERS ALONE
HE THEREFORE PAID HIM A VISIT
FROM THAT INTERVIEW
HE ASSURED ME THAT HE GATHERED THE IMPRESSION THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE I
WOULD HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY WITH MR
WINTERS AND THAT HE WINTERS WOULD
CALL ON ME AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN MY OWN OFFICE
MY OWN PRECAUTIONS
AS SHERIFF CUMMINGS WAS IN GOLD HILL THAT AFTERNOON AND AS I DESIRED TO
CONVERSE WITH HIM ABOUT THE PREVIOUS ASSAULT I INVITED HIM TO MY OFFICE
AND HE CAME
ALTHOUGH A HALF HOUR HAD PASSED BEYOND FOUR O'CLOCK MR
WINTERS HAD NOT CALLED AND WE BOTH OF US BEGAN PREPARING TO GO HOME
JUST THEN PHILIP LYNCH PUBLISHER OF THE GOLD HILL NEWS CAME IN AND
SAID BLANDLY AND CHEERILY AS IF BRINGING GOOD NEWS
HELLO JOHN B
WINTERS WANTS TO SEE YOU
I REPLIED INDEED WHY HE SENT ME WORD THAT HE WOULD CALL ON ME HERE
THIS AFTERNOON AT FOUR O'CLOCK
O WELL IT DON'T DO TO BE TOO CEREMONIOUS JUST NOW HE'S IN MY OFFICE
AND THAT WILL DO AS WELL COME ON IN WINTERS WANTS TO CONSULT WITH YOU
ALONE
HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU
THOUGH SLIGHTLY UNEASY AT THIS CHANGE OF PROGRAMME YET BELIEVING THAT IN
AN EDITOR'S HOUSE I OUGHT TO BE SAFE AND ANYHOW THAT I WOULD BE WITHIN
HAIL OF THE STREET I HURRIEDLY AND BUT PARTIALLY WHISPERED MY DIM
APPREHENSIONS TO MR
CUMMINGS AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT KEEP NEAR
ENOUGH TO HEAR MY VOICE IN CASE I SHOULD CALL
HE CONSENTED TO DO SO
WHILE WAITING FOR SOME OTHER PARTIES AND TO COME IN IF HE HEARD MY VOICE
OR THOUGHT I HAD NEED OF PROTECTION
ON REACHING THE EDITORIAL PART OF THE NEWS OFFICE WHICH VIEWED FROM THE
STREET IS DARK I DID NOT SEE MR
WINTERS AND AGAIN MY MISGIVINGS AROSE
HAD I PAUSED LONG ENOUGH TO CONSIDER THE CASE I SHOULD HAVE INVITED
SHERIFF CUMMINGS IN BUT AS LYNCH WENT DOWN STAIRS HE SAID THIS WAY
WIEGAND IT'S BEST TO BE PRIVATE OR SOME SUCH REMARK
I DO NOT DESIRE TO STRAIN THE READER'S FANCY HURTFULLY AND YET IT
WOULD BE A FAVOR TO ME IF HE WOULD TRY TO FANCY THIS LAMB IN BATTLE OR
THE DUELLING GROUND OR AT THE HEAD OF A VIGILANCE COMMITTEE M
T
I FOLLOWED AND WITHOUT MR
CUMMINGS AND WITHOUT ARMS WHICH I NEVER DO
OR WILL CARRY UNLESS AS A SOLDIER IN WAR OR UNLESS I SHOULD YET COME TO
FEEL I MUST FIGHT A DUEL OR TO JOIN AND AID IN THE RANKS OF A NECESSARY
VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
BUT BY FOLLOWING I MADE A FATAL MISTAKE
FOLLOWING
WAS ENTERING A TRAP AND WHATEVER ANIMAL SUFFERS ITSELF TO BE CAUGHT
SHOULD EXPECT THE COMMON FATE OF A CAGED RAT AS I FEAR EVENTS TO COME
WILL PROVE
TRAPS COMMONLY ARE NOT SET FOR BENEVOLENCE
HIS BODY GUARD IS SHUT OUT
THE TRAP INSIDE
I FOLLOWED LYNCH DOWN STAIRS
AT THEIR FOOT A DOOR TO THE LEFT OPENED
INTO A SMALL ROOM
FROM THAT ROOM ANOTHER DOOR OPENED INTO YET ANOTHER
ROOM AND ONCE ENTERED I FOUND MYSELF INVEIGLED INTO WHAT MANY WILL EVER
HENCEFORTH REGARD AS A PRIVATE SUBTERRANEAN GOLD HILL DEN ADMIRABLY
ADAPTED IN PROPER HANDS TO THE PURPOSES OF MURDER RAW OR DISGUISED FOR
FROM IT WITH BOTH OR EVEN ONE DOOR CLOSED WHEN TOO LATE I SAW THAT I
COULD NOT BE HEARD BY SHERIFF CUMMINGS AND FROM IT BY VIOLENCE AND BY
FORCE I WAS PREVENTED FROM MAKING A PEACEABLE EXIT WHEN I THOUGHT I SAW
THE STUDIOUS OBJECT OF THIS CONSULTATION WAS NO OTHER THAN TO COMPASS
MY KILLING IN THE PRESENCE OF PHILIP LYNCH AS A WITNESS AS SOON AS BY
INSULT A PROVERBIALLY EXCITABLE MAN SHOULD BE EXASPERATED TO THE POINT OF
ASSAILING MR
WINTERS SO THAT MR
LYNCH BY HIS CONSCIENCE AND BY HIS
WELL KNOWN TENDERNESS OF HEART TOWARD THE RICH AND POTENT WOULD BE
COMPELLED TO TESTIFY THAT HE SAW GEN
JOHN B
WINTERS KILL CONRAD WIEGAND
IN SELF DEFENCE BUT I AM GOING TOO FAST
OUR HOST
MR
LYNCH WAS PRESENT DURING THE MOST OF THE TIME SAY A LITTLE SHORT OF
AN HOUR BUT THREE TIMES HE LEFT THE ROOM
HIS TESTIMONY THEREFORE
WOULD BE AVAILABLE ONLY AS TO THE BULK OF WHAT TRANSPIRED
ON ENTERING
THIS CARPETED DEN I WAS INVITED TO A SEAT NEAR ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM
MR
LYNCH TOOK A SEAT NEAR THE WINDOW
J
B
WINTERS SAT AT FIRST NEAR
THE DOOR AND BEGAN HIS REMARKS ESSENTIALLY AS FOLLOWS
I HAVE COME HERE TO EXACT OF YOU A RETRACTION IN BLACK AND WHITE OF
THOSE DAMNABLY FALSE CHARGES WHICH YOU HAVE PREFERRED AGAINST ME IN
THAT INFAMOUS LYING SHEET OF YOURS AND YOU MUST DECLARE YOURSELF THEIR
AUTHOR THAT YOU PUBLISHED THEM KNOWING THEM TO BE FALSE AND THAT YOUR
MOTIVES WERE MALICIOUS
HOLD MR
WINTERS
YOUR LANGUAGE IS INSULTING AND YOUR DEMAND AN
ENORMITY
I TRUST I WAS NOT INVITED HERE EITHER TO BE INSULTED OR
COERCED
I SUPPOSED MYSELF HERE BY INVITATION OF MR
LYNCH AT YOUR
REQUEST
NOR DID I COME HERE TO INSULT YOU
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM
HERE FOR A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE
YET YOUR LANGUAGE HAS BEEN OFFENSIVE AND EVEN NOW SHOWS STRONG
EXCITEMENT
IF INSULT IS REPEATED I SHALL EITHER LEAVE THE ROOM OR CALL
IN SHERIFF CUMMINGS WHOM I JUST LEFT STANDING AND WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE
THE DOOR
NO YOU WON'T SIR
YOU MAY JUST AS WELL UNDERSTAND IT AT ONCE AS NOT
HERE YOU ARE MY MAN AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY MONTHS AGO YOU PUT YOUR
PROPERTY OUT OF YOUR HANDS BOASTING THAT YOU DID SO TO ESCAPE LOSING IT
ON PROSECUTION FOR LIBEL
IT IS TRUE THAT I DID CONVERT ALL MY IMMOVABLE PROPERTY INTO PERSONAL
PROPERTY SUCH AS I COULD TRUST SAFELY TO OTHERS AND CHIEFLY TO ESCAPE
RUIN THROUGH POSSIBLE LIBEL SUITS
VERY GOOD SIR
HAVING PLACED YOURSELF BEYOND THE PALE OF THE LAW MAY
GOD HELP YOUR SOUL IF YOU DON'T MAKE PRECISELY SUCH A RETRACTION AS I
HAVE DEMANDED
I'VE GOT YOU NOW AND BY BEFORE YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS
ROOM YOU'VE GOT TO BOTH WRITE AND SIGN PRECISELY THE RETRACTION I HAVE
DEMANDED AND BEFORE YOU GO ANYHOW YOU LOW LIVED LYING I'LL
TEACH YOU WHAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IS OUTSIDE OF THE LAW AND BY
SHERIFF CUMMINGS AND ALL THE FRIENDS YOU'VE GOT IN THE WORLD BESIDES
CAN'T SAVE YOU YOU ETC NO SIR
I'M ALONE NOW AND I'M PREPARED
TO BE SHOT DOWN JUST HERE AND NOW RATHER THAN BE VILLIFIED BY YOU AS I
HAVE BEEN AND SUFFER YOU TO ESCAPE ME AFTER PUBLISHING THOSE CHARGES
NOT ONLY HERE WHERE I AM KNOWN AND UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED BUT WHERE I AM
NOT PERSONALLY KNOWN AND MAY BE INJURED
I CONFESS THIS SPEECH WITH ITS TERRIBLE AND BUT TOO PLAINLY IMPLIED
THREAT OF KILLING ME IF I DID NOT SIGN THE PAPER HE DEMANDED TERRIFIED
ME ESPECIALLY AS I SAW HE WAS WORKING HIMSELF UP TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE
PITCH OF PASSION AND INSTINCT TOLD ME THAT ANY REPLY OTHER THAN ONE OF
SEEMING CONCESSION TO HIS DEMANDS WOULD ONLY BE FUEL TO A RAGING FIRE
SO I REPLIED
WELL IF I'VE GOT TO SIGN AND THEN I PAUSED SOME TIME
RESUMING
I SAID BUT MR
WINTERS YOU ARE GREATLY EXCITED
BESIDES I SEE YOU
ARE LABORING UNDER A TOTAL MISAPPREHENSION
IT IS YOUR DUTY NOT TO
INFLAME BUT TO CALM YOURSELF
I AM PREPARED TO SHOW YOU IF YOU WILL
ONLY POINT OUT THE ARTICLE THAT YOU ALLUDE TO THAT YOU REGARD AS
'CHARGES' WHAT NO CALM AND LOGICAL MIND HAS ANY RIGHT TO REGARD AS SUCH
SHOW ME THE CHARGES AND I WILL TRY AT ALL EVENTS AND IF IT BECOMES
PLAIN THAT NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN PREFERRED THEN PLAINLY THERE CAN BE
NOTHING TO RETRACT AND NO ONE COULD RIGHTLY URGE YOU TO DEMAND A
RETRACTION
YOU SHOULD BEWARE OF MAKING SO SERIOUS A MISTAKE FOR
HOWEVER HONEST A MAN MAY BE EVERY ONE IS LIABLE TO MISAPPREHEND
BESIDES YOU ASSUME THAT I AM THE AUTHOR OF SOME CERTAIN ARTICLE WHICH YOU
HAVE NOT POINTED OUT
IT IS HASTY TO DO SO
HE THEN POINTED TO SOME NUMBERED PARAGRAPHS IN A TRIBUNE ARTICLE HEADED
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YELLOW JACKET SAYING THAT'S WHAT I REFER TO
TO GAIN TIME FOR GENERAL REFLECTION AND RESOLUTION I TOOK UP THE PAPER
AND LOOKED IT OVER FOR AWHILE HE REMAINING SILENT AND AS I HOPED
COOLING
I THEN RESUMED SAYING AS I SUPPOSED
I DO NOT ADMIT HAVING
WRITTEN THAT ARTICLE NOR HAVE YOU ANY RIGHT TO ASSUME SO IMPORTANT A
POINT AND THEN BASE IMPORTANT ACTION UPON YOUR ASSUMPTION
YOU MIGHT
DEEPLY REGRET IT AFTERWARDS
IN MY PUBLISHED ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE I
NOTIFIED THE WORLD THAT NO INFORMATION AS TO THE AUTHORSHIP OF ANY
ARTICLE WOULD BE GIVEN WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE WRITER
I THEREFORE
CANNOT HONORABLY TELL YOU WHO WROTE THAT ARTICLE NOR CAN YOU EXACT IT
IF YOU ARE NOT THE AUTHOR THEN I DO DEMAND TO KNOW WHO IS
I MUST DECLINE TO SAY
THEN BY I BRAND YOU AS ITS AUTHOR AND SHALL TREAT YOU ACCORDINGLY
PASSING THAT POINT THE MOST IMPORTANT MISAPPREHENSION WHICH I NOTICE
IS THAT YOU REGARD THEM AS 'CHARGES' AT ALL WHEN THEIR CONTEXT BOTH AT
THEIR BEGINNING AND END SHOW THEY ARE NOT
THESE WORDS INTRODUCE THEM
'SUCH AN INVESTIGATION JUST BEFORE INDICATED WE THINK MIGHT RESULT IN
SHOWING SOME OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS THEN FOLLOW ELEVEN SPECIFICATIONS
AND THE SUCCEEDING PARAGRAPH SHOWS THAT THE SUGGESTED INVESTIGATION
'MIGHT EXONERATE THOSE WHO ARE GENERALLY BELIEVED GUILTY YOU SEE
THEREFORE THE CONTEXT PROVES THEY ARE NOT PREFERRED AS CHARGES AND THIS
YOU SEEM TO HAVE OVERLOOKED
WHILE MAKING THOSE COMMENTS MR
WINTERS FREQUENTLY INTERRUPTED ME IN
SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE ME THAT HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO CONSIDER
CANDIDLY THE THOUGHTS CONTAINED IN MY WORDS
HE INSISTED UPON IT THAT
THEY WERE CHARGES AND BY HE WOULD MAKE ME TAKE THEM BACK AS
CHARGES AND HE REFERRED THE QUESTION TO PHILIP LYNCH TO WHOM I THEN
APPEALED AS A LITERARY MAN AS A LOGICIAN AND AS AN EDITOR CALLING HIS
ATTENTION ESPECIALLY TO THE INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH JUST BEFORE QUOTED
HE REPLIED IF THEY ARE NOT CHARGES THEY CERTAINLY ARE INSINUATIONS
WHEREUPON MR
WINTERS RENEWED HIS DEMANDS FOR RETRACTION PRECISELY SUCH
AS HE HAD BEFORE NAMED EXCEPT THAT HE WOULD ALLOW ME TO STATE WHO DID
WRITE THE ARTICLE IF I DID NOT MYSELF AND THIS TIME SHAKING HIS FIST IN
MY FACE WITH MORE CURSINGS AND EPITHETS
WHEN HE THREATENED ME WITH HIS CLENCHED FIST INSTINCTIVELY I TRIED TO
RISE FROM MY CHAIR BUT WINTERS THEN FORCIBLY THRUST ME DOWN AS HE DID
EVERY OTHER TIME AT LEAST SEVEN OR EIGHT WHEN UNDER SIMILAR IMMINENT
DANGER OF BRUISING BY HIS FIST OR FOR AUGHT I COULD KNOW WORSE THAN THAT
AFTER THE FIRST STUNNING BLOW WHICH HE COULD EASILY AND SAFELY TO
HIMSELF HAVE DEALT ME SO LONG AS HE KEPT ME DOWN AND STOOD OVER ME
THIS FACT IT WAS WHICH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE CONVINCED ME THAT BY
PLAN AND PLOT I WAS PURPOSELY MADE POWERLESS IN MR
WINTERS' HANDS AND
THAT HE DID NOT MEAN TO ALLOW ME THAT ADVANTAGE OF BEING AFOOT WHICH HE
POSSESSED
MOREOVER I THEN BECAME CONVINCED THAT PHILIP LYNCH AND FOR
WHAT REASON I WONDERED WOULD DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO PROTECT ME IN HIS
OWN HOUSE
I REALIZED THEN THE SITUATION THOROUGHLY
I HAD FOUND IT
EQUALLY VAIN TO PROTEST OR ARGUE AND I WOULD MAKE NO UNMANLY APPEAL FOR
PITY STILL LESS APOLOGIZE
YET MY LIFE HAD BEEN BY THE PLAINEST
POSSIBLE IMPLICATION THREATENED
I WAS A WEAK MAN
I WAS UNARMED
I
WAS HELPLESSLY DOWN AND WINTERS WAS AFOOT AND PROBABLY ARMED
LYNCH WAS
THE ONLY WITNESS THE STATEMENTS DEMANDED IF GIVEN AND NOT EXPLAINED
WOULD UTTERLY SINK ME IN MY OWN SELF RESPECT IN MY FAMILY'S EYES AND IN
THE EYES OF THE COMMUNITY
ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD I GIVE THE AUTHOR'S
NAME HOW COULD I EVER EXPECT THAT CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WHICH I SHOULD
NO LONGER DESERVE AND HOW MUCH DEARER TO ME AND TO MY FAMILY WAS MY LIFE
THAN THE LIFE OF THE REAL AUTHOR TO HIS FRIENDS
YET LIFE SEEMED DEAR
AND EACH MINUTE THAT REMAINED SEEMED PRECIOUS IF NOT SOLEMN
I SINCERELY
TRUST THAT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OF YOUR READERS AND ESPECIALLY NONE WITH
FAMILIES MAY EVER BE PLACED IN SUCH SEEMING DIRECT PROXIMITY TO DEATH
WHILE OBLIGED TO DECIDE THE ONE QUESTION I WAS COMPELLED TO VIZ WHAT
SHOULD I DO I A MAN OF FAMILY AND NOT AS MR
WINTERS IS ALONE
THE READER IS REQUESTED NOT TO SKIP THE FOLLOWING M
T
STRATEGY AND MESMERISM
TO GAIN TIME FOR FURTHER REFLECTION AND HOPING THAT BY A SEEMING
ACQUIESCENCE I MIGHT REGAIN MY PERSONAL LIBERTY AT LEAST TILL I COULD
GIVE AN ALARM OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME MOMENTARY INADVERTENCE OF
WINTERS AND THEN WITHOUT A COWARDLY FLIGHT ESCAPE I RESOLVED TO WRITE A
CERTAIN KIND OF RETRACTION BUT PREVIOUSLY HAD INWARDLY DECIDED
FIRST THAT I WOULD STUDIOUSLY AVOID EVERY ACTION WHICH MIGHT BE
CONSTRUED INTO THE DRAWING OF A WEAPON EVEN BY A SELF INFURIATED MAN NO
MATTER WHAT AMOUNT OF INSULT MIGHT BE HEAPED UPON ME FOR IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT THIS GREAT EXCESS OF COMPOUND PROFANITY FOULNESS AND EPITHET MUST
BE MORE THAN A MERE INDULGENCE AND THEREFORE MUST HAVE SOME OBJECT
SURELY IN VAIN THE NET IS SPREAD IN THE SIGHT OF ANY BIRD THEREFORE
AS BEFORE WITHOUT THOUGHT I THEREAFTER BY INTENT KEPT MY HANDS AWAY FROM
MY POCKETS AND GENERALLY IN SIGHT AND SPREAD UPON MY KNEES
SECOND I RESOLVED TO MAKE NO MOTION WITH MY ARMS OR HANDS WHICH COULD
POSSIBLY BE CONSTRUED INTO AGGRESSION
THIRD I RESOLVED COMPLETELY TO GOVERN MY OUTWARD MANNER AND SUPPRESS
INDIGNATION
TO DO THIS I MUST GOVERN MY SPIRIT
TO DO THAT BY FORCE
OF IMAGINATION I WAS OBLIGED LIKE ACTORS ON THE BOARDS TO RESOLVE MYSELF
INTO AN UNNATURAL MENTAL STATE AND SEE ALL THINGS THROUGH THE EYES OF AN
ASSUMED CHARACTER
FOURTH I RESOLVED TO TRY ON WINTERS SILENTLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY TO
HIMSELF A MESMERIC POWER WHICH I POSSESS OVER CERTAIN KINDS OF PEOPLE
AND WHICH AT TIMES I HAVE FOUND TO WORK EVEN IN THE DARK OVER THE LOWER
ANIMALS
DOES ANY ONE SMILE AT THESE LAST COUNTS GOD SAVE YOU FROM EVER BEING
OBLIGED TO BEAT IN A GAME OF CHESS WHOSE STAKE IS YOUR LIFE YOU HAVING
BUT FOUR POOR PAWNS AND PIECES AND YOUR ADVERSARY WITH HIS FULL FORCE
UNSHORN
BUT IF YOU ARE PROVIDED YOU HAVE ANY STRENGTH WITH BREADTH OF
WILL DO NOT DESPAIR
THOUGH MESMERIC POWER MAY NOT SAVE YOU IT MAY
HELP YOU TRY IT AT ALL EVENTS
IN THIS INSTANCE I WAS CONSCIOUS OF
POWER COMING INTO ME AND BY A LAW OF NATURE I KNOW WINTERS WAS
CORRESPONDINGLY WEAKENED
IF I COULD HAVE GAINED MORE TIME I AM SURE HE
WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE STRUCK ME
IT TAKES TIME BOTH TO FORM SUCH RESOLUTIONS AND TO RECITE THEM
THAT
TIME HOWEVER I GAINED WHILE THINKING OF MY RETRACTION WHICH I FIRST
WROTE IN PENCIL ALTERING IT FROM TIME TO TIME TILL I GOT IT TO SUIT ME
MY AIM BEING TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A CONCESSION TO DEMANDS WHILE IN FACT
IT SHOULD TERSELY SPEAK THE TRUTH INTO MR
WINTERS' MIND
WHEN IT WAS
FINISHED I COPIED IT IN INK AND IF CORRECTLY COPIED FROM MY FIRST DRAFT
IT SHOULD READ AS FOLLOWS
IN COPYING I DO NOT THINK I MADE ANY MATERIAL
CHANGE
COPY
TO PHILIP LYNCH EDITOR OF THE GOLD HILL NEWS I LEARN THAT GEN
JOHN B
WINTERS BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING PASTED ON CLIPPING FROM THE PEOPLE'S
TRIBUNE OF JANUARY TO CONTAIN DISTINCT CHARGES OF MINE AGAINST HIM
PERSONALLY AND THAT AS SUCH HE DESIRES ME TO RETRACT THEM UNQUALIFIEDLY
IN COMPLIANCE WITH HIS REQUEST PERMIT ME TO SAY THAT ALTHOUGH MR
WINTERS AND I SEE THIS MATTER DIFFERENTLY IN VIEW OF HIS STRONG FEELINGS
IN THE PREMISES I HEREBY DECLARE THAT I DO NOT KNOW THOSE CHARGES IF
SUCH THEY ARE TO BE TRUE AND I HOPE THAT A CRITICAL EXAMINATION WOULD
ALTOGETHER DISPROVE THEM
CONRAD WIEGAND
GOLD HILL JANUARY 15 1870
I THEN READ WHAT I HAD WRITTEN AND HANDED IT TO MR
LYNCH WHEREUPON MR
WINTERS SAID
THAT'S NOT SATISFACTORY AND IT WON'T DO AND THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF
TO MR
LYNCH HE FURTHER SAID HOW DOES IT STRIKE YOU
WELL I CONFESS I DON'T SEE THAT IT RETRACTS ANYTHING
NOR DO I SAID WINTERS IN FACT I REGARD IT AS ADDING INSULT TO
INJURY
MR
WIEGAND YOU'VE GOT TO DO BETTER THAN THAT
YOU ARE NOT THE
MAN WHO CAN PULL WOOL OVER MY EYES
THAT SIR IS THE ONLY RETRACTION I CAN WRITE
NO IT ISN'T SIR AND IF YOU SO MUCH AS SAY SO AGAIN YOU DO IT AT YOUR
PERIL FOR I'LL THRASH YOU TO WITHIN AN INCH OF YOUR LIFE AND BY
SIR I DON'T PLEDGE MYSELF TO SPARE YOU EVEN THAT INCH EITHER
I WANT
YOU TO UNDERSTAND I HAVE ASKED YOU FOR A VERY DIFFERENT PAPER AND THAT
PAPER YOU'VE GOT TO SIGN
MR
WINTERS I ASSURE YOU THAT I DO NOT WISH TO IRRITATE YOU BUT AT
THE SAME TIME IT IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO WRITE ANY OTHER PAPER
THAN THAT WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN
IF YOU ARE RESOLVED TO COMPEL ME TO SIGN
SOMETHING PHILIP LYNCH'S HAND MUST WRITE AT YOUR DICTATION AND IF WHEN
WRITTEN I CAN SIGN IT I WILL DO SO BUT SUCH A DOCUMENT AS YOU SAY YOU
MUST HAVE FROM ME I NEVER CAN SIGN
I MEAN WHAT I SAY
WELL SIR WHAT'S TO BE DONE MUST BE DONE QUICKLY FOR I'VE BEEN HERE
LONG ENOUGH ALREADY
I'LL PUT THE THING IN ANOTHER SHAPE AND THEN
POINTING TO THE PAPER DON'T YOU KNOW THOSE CHARGES TO BE FALSE
I DO NOT
DO YOU KNOW THEM TO BE TRUE
OF MY OWN PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE I DO NOT
WHY THEN DID YOU PRINT THEM
BECAUSE RIGHTLY CONSIDERED IN THEIR CONNECTION THEY ARE NOT CHARGES BUT
PERTINENT AND USEFUL SUGGESTIONS IN ANSWER TO THE QUERIES OF A
CORRESPONDENT WHO STATED FACTS WHICH ARE INEXPLICABLE
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW THEY ARE FALSE
IF YOU DO THE PROPER COURSE IS SIMPLY TO DENY THEM AND COURT AN
INVESTIGATION
AND DO YOU CLAIM THE RIGHT TO MAKE ME COME OUT AND DENY ANYTHING YOU MAY
CHOOSE TO WRITE AND PRINT
TO THAT QUESTION I THINK I MADE NO REPLY AND HE THEN FURTHER SAID
COME NOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE MATTER LONG ENOUGH
I WANT YOUR FINAL
ANSWER DID YOU WRITE THAT ARTICLE OR NOT
I CANNOT IN HONOR TELL YOU WHO WROTE IT
DID YOU NOT SEE IT BEFORE IT WAS PRINTED
MOST CERTAINLY SIR
AND DID YOU DEEM IT A FIT THING TO PUBLISH
MOST ASSUREDLY SIR OR I WOULD NEVER HAVE CONSENTED TO ITS APPEARANCE
OF ITS AUTHORSHIP I CAN SAY NOTHING WHATEVER BUT FOR ITS PUBLICATION I
ASSUME FULL SOLE AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY
AND DO YOU THEN RETRACT IT OR NOT
MR
WINTERS IF MY REFUSAL TO SIGN SUCH A PAPER AS YOU HAVE DEMANDED
MUST ENTAIL UPON ME ALL THAT YOUR LANGUAGE IN THIS ROOM FAIRLY IMPLIES
THEN I ASK A FEW MINUTES FOR PRAYER
PRAYER YOU THIS IS NOT YOUR HOUR FOR PRAYER YOUR TIME TO PRAY WAS
WHEN YOU WERE WRITING THOSE LYING CHARGES
WILL YOU SIGN OR NOT
YOU ALREADY HAVE MY ANSWER
WHAT DO YOU STILL REFUSE
I DO SIR
TAKE THAT THEN AND TO MY AMAZEMENT AND INEXPRESSIBLE RELIEF HE DREW
ONLY A RAWHIDE INSTEAD OF WHAT I EXPECTED A BLUDGEON OR PISTOL
WITH
IT AS HE SPOKE HE STRUCK AT MY LEFT EAR DOWNWARDS AS IF TO TEAR IT
OFF AND AFTERWARDS ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD
AS HE MOVED AWAY TO GET A
BETTER CHANCE FOR A MORE EFFECTIVE SHOT FOR THE FIRST TIME I GAINED A
CHANCE UNDER PERIL TO RISE AND I DID SO PITYING HIM FROM THE VERY BOTTOM
OF MY SOUL TO THINK THAT ONE SO NATURALLY CAPABLE OF TRUE DIGNITY POWER
AND NOBILITY COULD BY THE TEMPTATIONS OF THIS STATE AND BY UNFORTUNATE
ASSOCIATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS BE SO DEEPLY DEBASED AS TO FIND IN SUCH
BRUTALITY ANYTHING WHICH HE COULD CALL SATISFACTION BUT THE GREAT HOPE
FOR US ALL IS IN PROGRESS AND GROWTH AND JOHN B
WINTERS I TRUST WILL
YET BE ABLE TO COMPREHEND MY FEELINGS
HE CONTINUED TO BEAT ME WITH ALL HIS GREAT FORCE UNTIL ABSOLUTELY WEARY
EXHAUSTED AND PANTING FOR BREATH
I STILL ADHERED TO MY PURPOSE OF
NON AGGRESSIVE DEFENCE AND MADE NO OTHER USE OF MY ARMS THAN TO DEFEND
MY HEAD AND FACE FROM FURTHER DISFIGUREMENT
THE MERE PAIN ARISING FROM
THE BLOWS HE INFLICTED UPON MY PERSON WAS OF COURSE TRANSIENT AND MY
CLOTHING TO SOME EXTENT DEADENED ITS SEVERITY AS IT NOW HIDES ALL
REMAINING TRACES
WHEN I SUPPOSED HE WAS THROUGH TAKING THE BUTT END OF HIS WEAPON AND
SHAKING IT IN MY FACE HE WARNED ME IF I CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD HIM OF
MORE YET TO COME AND FURTHERMORE SAID IF EVER I AGAIN DARED INTRODUCE
HIS NAME TO PRINT IN EITHER MY OWN OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC JOURNAL HE WOULD
CUT OFF MY LEFT EAR AND I DO NOT THINK HE WAS JESTING AND SEND ME HOME
TO MY FAMILY A VISIBLY MUTILATED MAN TO BE A STANDING WARNING TO ALL
LOW LIVED PUPPIES WHO SEEK TO BLACKMAIL GENTLEMEN AND TO INJURE THEIR
GOOD NAMES
AND WHEN HE DID SO OPERATE HE INFORMED ME THAT HIS
IMPLEMENT WOULD NOT BE A WHIP BUT A KNIFE
WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS UNACCOMPANIED BY MR
LYNCH AS I REMEMBER IT HE
LEFT THE ROOM FOR I SAT DOWN BY MR
LYNCH EXCLAIMING THE MAN IS MAD
HE IS UTTERLY MAD THIS STEP IS HIS RUIN IT IS A MISTAKE IT WOULD BE
UNGENEROUS IN ME DESPITE OF ALL THE ILL USAGE I HAVE HERE RECEIVED TO
EXPOSE HIM AT LEAST UNTIL HE HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT UPON THE
MATTER
I SHALL BE IN NO HASTE
WINTERS IS VERY MAD JUST NOW REPLIED MR
LYNCH BUT WHEN HE IS
HIMSELF HE IS ONE OF THE FINEST MEN I EVER MET
IN FACT HE TOLD ME THE
REASON HE DID NOT MEET YOU UPSTAIRS WAS TO SPARE YOU THE HUMILIATION OF A
BEATING IN THE SIGHT OF OTHERS
I SUBMIT THAT THAT UNGUARDED REMARK OF PHILIP LYNCH CONVICTS HIM OF
HAVING BEEN PRIVY IN ADVANCE TO MR
WINTERS' INTENTIONS WHATEVER THEY MAY
HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST TO HIS MEANING TO MAKE AN ASSAULT UPON ME BUT I
LEAVE TO OTHERS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH CENSURE AN EDITOR DESERVES FOR
INVEIGLING A WEAK NON COMBATANT MAN ALSO A PUBLISHER TO A PEN OF HIS
OWN TO BE HORSEWHIPPED IF NO WORSE FOR THE SIMPLE PRINTING OF WHAT IS
VERBALLY IN THE MOUTH OF NINE OUT OF TEN MEN AND WOMEN TOO UPON THE
STREET
WHILE WRITING THIS ACCOUNT TWO THEORIES HAVE OCCURRED TO ME AS POSSIBLY
TRUE RESPECTING THIS MOST REMARKABLE ASSAULT
FIRST THE AIM MAY HAVE BEEN SIMPLY TO EXTORT FROM ME SUCH ADMISSIONS AS
IN THE HANDS OF MONEY AND INFLUENCE WOULD HAVE SENT ME TO THE
PENITENTIARY FOR LIBEL
THIS HOWEVER SEEMS UNLIKELY BECAUSE ANY
STATEMENTS ELICITED BY FEAR OR FORCE COULD NOT BE EVIDENCE IN LAW OR
COULD BE SO EXPLAINED AS TO HAVE NO FORCE
THE STATEMENTS WANTED SO
BADLY MUST HAVE BEEN DESIRED FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSE
SECOND THE OTHER THEORY HAS SO DARK AND WILFULLY MURDEROUS A LOOK THAT I
SHRINK FROM WRITING IT YET AS IN ALL PROBABILITY MY DEATH AT THE
EARLIEST PRACTICABLE MOMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN DECREED I FEEL I SHOULD DO
ALL I CAN BEFORE MY HOUR ARRIVES AT LEAST TO SHOW OTHERS HOW TO BREAK UP
THAT ARISTOCRATIC RULE AND COMBINATION WHICH HAS ROBBED ALL NEVADA OF
TRUE FREEDOM IF NOT OF MANHOOD ITSELF
ALTHOUGH I DO NOT PREFER THIS
HYPOTHESIS AS A CHARGE I FEEL THAT AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN I STILL HAVE
A RIGHT BOTH TO THINK AND TO SPEAK MY THOUGHTS EVEN IN THE LAND OF SHARON
AND WINTERS AND AS MUCH SO RESPECTING THE THEORY OF A BRUTAL ASSAULT
ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE BEEN ITS SUBJECT AS RESPECTING ANY OTHER
APPARENT ENORMITY
I GIVE THE MATTER SIMPLY AS A SUGGESTION WHICH MAY
EXPLAIN TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES AND TO THE PEOPLE WHOM THEY SHOULD
REPRESENT A WELL ASCERTAINED BUT NOTWITHSTANDING A DARKLY MYSTERIOUS
FACT
THE SCHEME OF THE ASSAULT MAY HAVE BEEN
FIRST TO TERRIFY ME BY MAKING ME CONSCIOUS OF MY OWN HELPLESSNESS AFTER
MAKING ACTUAL THOUGH NOT LEGAL THREATS AGAINST MY LIFE
SECOND TO IMPLY THAT I COULD SAVE MY LIFE ONLY BY WRITING OR SIGNING
CERTAIN SPECIFIC STATEMENTS WHICH IF NOT SUBSEQUENTLY EXPLAINED WOULD
ETERNALLY HAVE BRANDED ME AS INFAMOUS AND WOULD HAVE CONSIGNED MY FAMILY
TO SHAME AND WANT AND TO THE DREADFUL COMPASSION AND PATRONAGE OF THE
RICH
THIRD TO BLOW MY BRAINS OUT THE MOMENT I HAD SIGNED THEREBY PREVENTING
ME FROM MAKING ANY SUBSEQUENT EXPLANATION SUCH AS COULD REMOVE THE
INFAMY
FOURTH PHILIP LYNCH TO BE COMPELLED TO TESTIFY THAT I WAS KILLED BY JOHN
B
WINTERS IN SELF DEFENCE FOR THE CONVICTION OF WINTERS WOULD BRING
HIM IN AS AN ACCOMPLICE
IF THAT WAS THE PROGRAMME IN JOHN B
WINTERS'
MIND NOTHING SAVED MY LIFE BUT MY PERSISTENT REFUSAL TO SIGN WHEN THAT
REFUSAL SEEMED CLEARLY TO ME TO BE THE CHOICE OF DEATH
THE REMARKABLE ASSERTION MADE TO ME BY MR
WINTERS THAT PITY ONLY SPARED
MY LIFE ON WEDNESDAY EVENING LAST ALMOST COMPELS ME TO BELIEVE THAT AT
FIRST HE COULD NOT HAVE INTENDED ME TO LEAVE THAT ROOM ALIVE AND WHY I
WAS ALLOWED TO UNLESS THROUGH MESMERIC OR SOME OTHER INVISIBLE
INFLUENCE I CANNOT DIVINE
THE MORE I REFLECT UPON THIS MATTER THE
MORE PROBABLE AS TRUE DOES THIS HORRIBLE INTERPRETATION BECOME
THE NARRATION OF THESE THINGS I MIGHT HAVE SPARED BOTH TO MR
WINTERS AND
TO THE PUBLIC HAD HE HIMSELF OBSERVED SILENCE BUT AS HE HAS BOTH
VERBALLY SPOKEN AND SUFFERED A THOROUGHLY GARBLED STATEMENT OF FACTS TO
APPEAR IN THE GOLD HILL NEWS I FEEL IT DUE TO MYSELF NO LESS THAN TO THIS
COMMUNITY AND TO THE ENTIRE INDEPENDENT PRESS OF AMERICA AND GREAT
BRITAIN TO GIVE A TRUE ACCOUNT OF WHAT EVEN THE GOLD HILL NEWS HAS
PRONOUNCED A DISGRACEFUL AFFAIR AND WHICH IT DEEPLY REGRETS BECAUSE OF
SOME ALLEGED TELEGRAPHIC MISTAKE IN THE ACCOUNT OF IT
WHO RECEIVED THE
ERRONEOUS TELEGRAMS
THOUGH HE MAY NOT DEEM IT PRUDENT TO TAKE MY LIFE JUST NOW THE
PUBLICATION OF THIS ARTICLE I FEEL SURE MUST COMPEL GEN
WINTERS WITH
HIS PECULIAR VIEWS ABOUT HIS RIGHT TO EXEMPTION FROM CRITICISM BY ME TO
RESOLVE ON MY VIOLENT DEATH THOUGH IT MAY TAKE YEARS TO COMPASS IT
NOTWITHSTANDING I BEAR HIM NO ILL WILL AND IF W
C
RALSTON AND WILLIAM
SHARON AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO MINING AND MILLING RING
FEEL THAT HE ABOVE ALL OTHER MEN IN THIS STATE AND CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST
FITTING MAN TO SUPERVISE AND CONTROL YELLOW JACKET MATTERS UNTIL I AM
ABLE TO VOTE MORE THAN HALF THEIR STOCK I PRESUME HE WILL BE RETAINED TO
GRACE HIS PRESENT POST
MEANTIME I CORDIALLY INVITE ALL WHO KNOW OF ANY SORT OF IMPORTANT
VILLAINY WHICH ONLY CAN BE CURED BY EXPOSURE AND WHO WOULD EXPOSE IT IF
THEY FELT SURE THEY WOULD NOT BE BETRAYED UNDER BULLYING THREATS TO
COMMUNICATE WITH THE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE FOR UNTIL I AM MURDERED SO LONG
AS I CAN RAISE THE MEANS TO PUBLISH I PROPOSE TO CONTINUE MY EFFORTS AT
LEAST TO REVIVE THE LIBERTIES OF THE STATE TO CURB OPPRESSION AND TO
BENEFIT MAN'S WORLD AND GOD'S EARTH
CONRAD WIEGAND
IT DOES SEEM A PITY THAT THE SHERIFF WAS SHUT OUT SINCE THE GOOD SENSE
OF A GENERAL OF MILITIA AND OF A PROMINENT EDITOR FAILED TO TEACH THEM
THAT THE MERITED CASTIGATION OF THIS WEAK HALF WITTED CHILD WAS A THING
THAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE STREET WHERE THE POOR THING COULD
HAVE A CHANCE TO RUN
WHEN A JOURNALIST MALIGNS A CITIZEN OR ATTACKS
HIS GOOD NAME ON HEARSAY EVIDENCE HE DESERVES TO BE THRASHED FOR IT
EVEN IF HE IS A NON COMBATANT WEAKLING BUT A GENEROUS ADVERSARY WOULD
AT LEAST ALLOW SUCH A LAMB THE USE OF HIS LEGS AT SUCH A TIME M

PREFACE
MOST OF THE ADVENTURES RECORDED IN THIS BOOK REALLY OCCURRED ONE OR TWO
WERE EXPERIENCES OF MY OWN THE REST THOSE OF BOYS WHO WERE SCHOOLMATES
OF MINE
HUCK FINN IS DRAWN FROM LIFE TOM SAWYER ALSO BUT NOT FROM AN
INDIVIDUAL HE IS A COMBINATION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THREE BOYS WHOM
I KNEW AND THEREFORE BELONGS TO THE COMPOSITE ORDER OF ARCHITECTURE
THE ODD SUPERSTITIONS TOUCHED UPON WERE ALL PREVALENT AMONG CHILDREN AND
SLAVES IN THE WEST AT THE PERIOD OF THIS STORY THAT IS TO SAY THIRTY OR
FORTY YEARS AGO
ALTHOUGH MY BOOK IS INTENDED MAINLY FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF BOYS AND
GIRLS I HOPE IT WILL NOT BE SHUNNED BY MEN AND WOMEN ON THAT ACCOUNT
FOR PART OF MY PLAN HAS BEEN TO TRY TO PLEASANTLY REMIND ADULTS OF WHAT
THEY ONCE WERE THEMSELVES AND OF HOW THEY FELT AND THOUGHT AND TALKED
AND WHAT QUEER ENTERPRISES THEY SOMETIMES ENGAGED IN
THE AUTHOR
HARTFORD 1876
CHAPTER I
TOM
NO ANSWER
TOM
NO ANSWER
WHAT'S GONE WITH THAT BOY I WONDER YOU TOM
NO ANSWER
THE OLD LADY PULLED HER SPECTACLES DOWN AND LOOKED OVER THEM ABOUT THE
ROOM THEN SHE PUT THEM UP AND LOOKED OUT UNDER THEM
SHE SELDOM OR
NEVER LOOKED THROUGH THEM FOR SO SMALL A THING AS A BOY THEY WERE
HER STATE PAIR THE PRIDE OF HER HEART AND WERE BUILT FOR STYLE NOT
SERVICE SHE COULD HAVE SEEN THROUGH A PAIR OF STOVE LIDS JUST AS WELL
SHE LOOKED PERPLEXED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN SAID NOT FIERCELY BUT
STILL LOUD ENOUGH FOR THE FURNITURE TO HEAR
WELL I LAY IF I GET HOLD OF YOU I'LL
SHE DID NOT FINISH FOR BY THIS TIME SHE WAS BENDING DOWN AND PUNCHING
UNDER THE BED WITH THE BROOM AND SO SHE NEEDED BREATH TO PUNCTUATE THE
PUNCHES WITH
SHE RESURRECTED NOTHING BUT THE CAT
I NEVER DID SEE THE BEAT OF THAT BOY
SHE WENT TO THE OPEN DOOR AND STOOD IN IT AND LOOKED OUT AMONG THE
TOMATO VINES AND JIMPSON WEEDS THAT CONSTITUTED THE GARDEN
NO TOM
SO
SHE LIFTED UP HER VOICE AT AN ANGLE CALCULATED FOR DISTANCE AND SHOUTED
Y O U U TOM
THERE WAS A SLIGHT NOISE BEHIND HER AND SHE TURNED JUST IN TIME TO SEIZE
A SMALL BOY BY THE SLACK OF HIS ROUNDABOUT AND ARREST HIS FLIGHT
THERE I MIGHT 'A' THOUGHT OF THAT CLOSET
WHAT YOU BEEN DOING IN
THERE
NOTHING
NOTHING LOOK AT YOUR HANDS
AND LOOK AT YOUR MOUTH
WHAT IS THAT
TRUCK
I DON'T KNOW AUNT
WELL I KNOW
IT'S JAM THAT'S WHAT IT IS
FORTY TIMES I'VE SAID IF YOU
DIDN'T LET THAT JAM ALONE I'D SKIN YOU
HAND ME THAT SWITCH
THE SWITCH HOVERED IN THE AIR THE PERIL WAS DESPERATE
MY LOOK BEHIND YOU AUNT
THE OLD LADY WHIRLED ROUND AND SNATCHED HER SKIRTS OUT OF DANGER
THE LAD FLED ON THE INSTANT SCRAMBLED UP THE HIGH BOARD FENCE AND
DISAPPEARED OVER IT
HIS AUNT POLLY STOOD SURPRISED A MOMENT AND THEN BROKE INTO A GENTLE
LAUGH
HANG THE BOY CAN'T I NEVER LEARN ANYTHING AIN'T HE PLAYED ME TRICKS
ENOUGH LIKE THAT FOR ME TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR HIM BY THIS TIME BUT OLD
FOOLS IS THE BIGGEST FOOLS THERE IS
CAN'T LEARN AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS
AS THE SAYING IS
BUT MY GOODNESS HE NEVER PLAYS THEM ALIKE TWO DAYS
AND HOW IS A BODY TO KNOW WHAT'S COMING HE 'PEARS TO KNOW JUST HOW LONG
HE CAN TORMENT ME BEFORE I GET MY DANDER UP AND HE KNOWS IF HE CAN MAKE
OUT TO PUT ME OFF FOR A MINUTE OR MAKE ME LAUGH IT'S ALL DOWN AGAIN AND
I CAN'T HIT HIM A LICK
I AIN'T DOING MY DUTY BY THAT BOY AND THAT'S
THE LORD'S TRUTH GOODNESS KNOWS
SPARE THE ROD AND SPILE THE CHILD
AS THE GOOD BOOK SAYS
I'M A LAYING UP SIN AND SUFFERING FOR US BOTH
I KNOW
HE'S FULL OF THE OLD SCRATCH BUT LAWS A ME HE'S MY OWN
DEAD SISTER'S BOY POOR THING AND I AIN'T GOT THE HEART TO LASH HIM
SOMEHOW
EVERY TIME I LET HIM OFF MY CONSCIENCE DOES HURT ME SO AND
EVERY TIME I HIT HIM MY OLD HEART MOST BREAKS
WELL A WELL MAN THAT IS
BORN OF WOMAN IS OF FEW DAYS AND FULL OF TROUBLE AS THE SCRIPTURE
SAYS AND I RECKON IT'S SO
HE'LL PLAY HOOKEY THIS EVENING AND
SOUTHWESTERN FOR AFTERNOON I'LL JUST BE OBLEEGED TO MAKE HIM WORK
TOMORROW TO PUNISH HIM
IT'S MIGHTY HARD TO MAKE HIM WORK SATURDAYS
WHEN ALL THE BOYS IS HAVING HOLIDAY BUT HE HATES WORK MORE THAN HE
HATES ANYTHING ELSE AND I'VE GOT TO DO SOME OF MY DUTY BY HIM OR
I'LL BE THE RUINATION OF THE CHILD
TOM DID PLAY HOOKEY AND HE HAD A VERY GOOD TIME
HE GOT BACK HOME
BARELY IN SEASON TO HELP JIM THE SMALL COLORED BOY SAW NEXT DAY'S WOOD
AND SPLIT THE KINDLINGS BEFORE SUPPER AT LEAST HE WAS THERE IN TIME
TO TELL HIS ADVENTURES TO JIM WHILE JIM DID THREE FOURTHS OF THE WORK
TOM'S YOUNGER BROTHER OR RATHER HALF BROTHER SID WAS ALREADY THROUGH
WITH HIS PART OF THE WORK PICKING UP CHIPS FOR HE WAS A QUIET BOY
AND HAD NO ADVENTUROUS TROUBLE SOME WAYS
WHILE TOM WAS EATING HIS SUPPER AND STEALING SUGAR AS OPPORTUNITY
OFFERED AUNT POLLY ASKED HIM QUESTIONS THAT WERE FULL OF GUILE AND
VERY DEEP FOR SHE WANTED TO TRAP HIM INTO DAMAGING REVEALMENTS
LIKE
MANY OTHER SIMPLE HEARTED SOULS IT WAS HER PET VANITY TO BELIEVE SHE
WAS ENDOWED WITH A TALENT FOR DARK AND MYSTERIOUS DIPLOMACY AND SHE
LOVED TO CONTEMPLATE HER MOST TRANSPARENT DEVICES AS MARVELS OF LOW
CUNNING
SAID SHE
TOM IT WAS MIDDLING WARM IN SCHOOL WARN'T IT
YES'M
POWERFUL WARM WARN'T IT
YES'M
DIDN'T YOU WANT TO GO IN A SWIMMING TOM
A BIT OF A SCARE SHOT THROUGH TOM A TOUCH OF UNCOMFORTABLE SUSPICION
HE
SEARCHED AUNT POLLY'S FACE BUT IT TOLD HIM NOTHING
SO HE SAID
NO'M WELL NOT VERY MUCH
THE OLD LADY REACHED OUT HER HAND AND FELT TOM'S SHIRT AND SAID
BUT YOU AIN'T TOO WARM NOW THOUGH AND IT FLATTERED HER TO REFLECT
THAT SHE HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE SHIRT WAS DRY WITHOUT ANYBODY KNOWING
THAT THAT WAS WHAT SHE HAD IN HER MIND
BUT IN SPITE OF HER TOM KNEW
WHERE THE WIND LAY NOW
SO HE FORESTALLED WHAT MIGHT BE THE NEXT MOVE
SOME OF US PUMPED ON OUR HEADS MINE'S DAMP YET
SEE
AUNT POLLY WAS VEXED TO THINK SHE HAD OVERLOOKED THAT BIT OF
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND MISSED A TRICK
THEN SHE HAD A NEW
INSPIRATION
TOM YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO UNDO YOUR SHIRT COLLAR WHERE I SEWED IT TO
PUMP ON YOUR HEAD DID YOU UNBUTTON YOUR JACKET
THE TROUBLE VANISHED OUT OF TOM'S FACE
HE OPENED HIS JACKET
HIS SHIRT
COLLAR WAS SECURELY SEWED
BOTHER WELL GO 'LONG WITH YOU
I'D MADE SURE YOU'D PLAYED HOOKEY
AND BEEN A SWIMMING
BUT I FORGIVE YE TOM
I RECKON YOU'RE A KIND OF A
SINGED CAT AS THE SAYING IS BETTER'N YOU LOOK
THIS TIME
SHE WAS HALF SORRY HER SAGACITY HAD MISCARRIED AND HALF GLAD THAT TOM
HAD STUMBLED INTO OBEDIENT CONDUCT FOR ONCE
BUT SIDNEY SAID
WELL NOW IF I DIDN'T THINK YOU SEWED HIS COLLAR WITH WHITE THREAD
BUT IT'S BLACK
WHY I DID SEW IT WITH WHITE TOM
BUT TOM DID NOT WAIT FOR THE REST
AS HE WENT OUT AT THE DOOR HE SAID
SIDDY I'LL LICK YOU FOR THAT
IN A SAFE PLACE TOM EXAMINED TWO LARGE NEEDLES WHICH WERE THRUST INTO
THE LAPELS OF HIS JACKET AND HAD THREAD BOUND ABOUT THEM ONE NEEDLE
CARRIED WHITE THREAD AND THE OTHER BLACK
HE SAID
SHE'D NEVER NOTICED IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR SID
CONFOUND IT SOMETIMES
SHE SEWS IT WITH WHITE AND SOMETIMES SHE SEWS IT WITH BLACK
I WISH TO
GEE MINY SHE'D STICK TO ONE OR T'OTHER I CAN'T KEEP THE RUN OF 'EM
BUT
I BET YOU I'LL LAM SID FOR THAT
I'LL LEARN HIM
HE WAS NOT THE MODEL BOY OF THE VILLAGE
HE KNEW THE MODEL BOY VERY WELL
THOUGH AND LOATHED HIM
WITHIN TWO MINUTES OR EVEN LESS HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALL HIS TROUBLES
NOT
BECAUSE HIS TROUBLES WERE ONE WHIT LESS HEAVY AND BITTER TO HIM THAN A
MAN'S ARE TO A MAN BUT BECAUSE A NEW AND POWERFUL INTEREST BORE
THEM DOWN AND DROVE THEM OUT OF HIS MIND FOR THE TIME JUST AS MEN'S
MISFORTUNES ARE FORGOTTEN IN THE EXCITEMENT OF NEW ENTERPRISES
THIS NEW
INTEREST WAS A VALUED NOVELTY IN WHISTLING WHICH HE HAD JUST ACQUIRED
FROM A NEGRO AND HE WAS SUFFERING TO PRACTISE IT UN DISTURBED
IT
CONSISTED IN A PECULIAR BIRD LIKE TURN A SORT OF LIQUID WARBLE
PRODUCED BY TOUCHING THE TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH AT SHORT
INTERVALS IN THE MIDST OF THE MUSIC THE READER PROBABLY REMEMBERS HOW TO
DO IT IF HE HAS EVER BEEN A BOY
DILIGENCE AND ATTENTION SOON GAVE HIM
THE KNACK OF IT AND HE STRODE DOWN THE STREET WITH HIS MOUTH FULL OF
HARMONY AND HIS SOUL FULL OF GRATITUDE
HE FELT MUCH AS AN ASTRONOMER
FEELS WHO HAS DISCOVERED A NEW PLANET NO DOUBT AS FAR AS STRONG DEEP
UNALLOYED PLEASURE IS CONCERNED THE ADVANTAGE WAS WITH THE BOY NOT THE
ASTRONOMER
THE SUMMER EVENINGS WERE LONG
IT WAS NOT DARK YET
PRESENTLY TOM
CHECKED HIS WHISTLE
A STRANGER WAS BEFORE HIM A BOY A SHADE LARGER
THAN HIMSELF
A NEW COMER OF ANY AGE OR EITHER SEX WAS AN IM PRESSIVE
CURIOSITY IN THE POOR LITTLE SHABBY VILLAGE OF ST
PETERSBURG
THIS BOY
WAS WELL DRESSED TOO WELL DRESSED ON A WEEK DAY
THIS WAS SIMPLY AS
ASTOUNDING
HIS CAP WAS A DAINTY THING HIS CLOSE BUTTONED BLUE CLOTH
ROUNDABOUT WAS NEW AND NATTY AND SO WERE HIS PANTALOONS
HE HAD SHOES
ON AND IT WAS ONLY FRIDAY
HE EVEN WORE A NECKTIE A BRIGHT BIT OF
RIBBON
HE HAD A CITIFIED AIR ABOUT HIM THAT ATE INTO TOM'S VITALS
THE
MORE TOM STARED AT THE SPLENDID MARVEL THE HIGHER HE TURNED UP HIS NOSE
AT HIS FINERY AND THE SHABBIER AND SHABBIER HIS OWN OUTFIT SEEMED TO
HIM TO GROW
NEITHER BOY SPOKE
IF ONE MOVED THE OTHER MOVED BUT ONLY
SIDEWISE IN A CIRCLE THEY KEPT FACE TO FACE AND EYE TO EYE ALL THE
TIME
FINALLY TOM SAID
I CAN LICK YOU
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY IT
WELL I CAN DO IT
NO YOU CAN'T EITHER
YES I CAN
NO YOU CAN'T
I CAN
YOU CAN'T
CAN

AN UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE
THEN TOM SAID
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
'TISN'T ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS MAYBE
WELL I 'LOW I'LL MAKE IT MY BUSINESS
WELL WHY DON'T YOU
IF YOU SAY MUCH I WILL
MUCH MUCH MUCH
THERE NOW
OH YOU THINK YOU'RE MIGHTY SMART DON'T YOU I COULD LICK YOU WITH
ONE HAND TIED BEHIND ME IF I WANTED TO
WELL WHY DON'T YOU DO IT YOU SAY YOU CAN DO IT
WELL I WILL IF YOU FOOL WITH ME
OH YES I'VE SEEN WHOLE FAMILIES IN THE SAME FIX
SMARTY YOU THINK YOU'RE SOME NOW DON'T YOU OH WHAT A HAT
YOU CAN LUMP THAT HAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT
I DARE YOU TO KNOCK IT
OFF AND ANYBODY THAT'LL TAKE A DARE WILL SUCK EGGS
YOU'RE A LIAR

OFF'N YOUR HEAD
OH OF COURSE YOU WILL
WELL I WILL
WELL WHY DON'T YOU DO IT THEN WHAT DO YOU KEEP SAYING YOU WILL
FOR WHY DON'T YOU DO IT IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
I AIN'T AFRAID
YOU ARE
I AIN'T
YOU ARE
ANOTHER PAUSE AND MORE EYING AND SIDLING AROUND EACH OTHER
PRESENTLY
THEY WERE SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
TOM SAID
GET AWAY FROM HERE
GO AWAY YOURSELF
I WON'T
I WON'T EITHER
SO THEY STOOD EACH WITH A FOOT PLACED AT AN ANGLE AS A BRACE AND BOTH
SHOVING WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND GLOWERING AT EACH OTHER WITH HATE
BUT
NEITHER COULD GET AN ADVANTAGE
AFTER STRUGGLING TILL BOTH WERE HOT AND
FLUSHED EACH RELAXED HIS STRAIN WITH WATCHFUL CAUTION AND TOM SAID
YOU'RE A COWARD AND A PUP
I'LL TELL MY BIG BROTHER ON YOU AND HE CAN
THRASH YOU WITH HIS LITTLE FINGER AND I'LL MAKE HIM DO IT TOO
WHAT DO I CARE FOR YOUR BIG BROTHER I'VE GOT A BROTHER THAT'S BIGGER
THAN HE IS AND WHAT'S MORE HE CAN THROW HIM OVER THAT FENCE TOO
BOTH BROTHERS WERE IMAGINARY
THAT'S A LIE
YOUR SAYING SO DON'T MAKE IT SO
TOM DREW A LINE IN THE DUST WITH HIS BIG TOE AND SAID
I DARE YOU TO STEP OVER THAT AND I'LL LICK YOU TILL YOU CAN'T STAND
UP
ANYBODY THAT'LL TAKE A DARE WILL STEAL SHEEP
THE NEW BOY STEPPED OVER PROMPTLY AND SAID
NOW YOU SAID YOU'D DO IT NOW LET'S SEE YOU DO IT
DON'T YOU CROWD ME NOW YOU BETTER LOOK OUT
WELL YOU SAID YOU'D DO IT WHY DON'T YOU DO IT
BY JINGO FOR TWO CENTS I WILL DO IT
THE NEW BOY TOOK TWO BROAD COPPERS OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HELD THEM OUT
WITH DERISION
TOM STRUCK THEM TO THE GROUND
IN AN INSTANT BOTH BOYS
WERE ROLLING AND TUMBLING IN THE DIRT GRIPPED TOGETHER LIKE CATS AND
FOR THE SPACE OF A MINUTE THEY TUGGED AND TORE AT EACH OTHER'S HAIR AND
CLOTHES PUNCHED AND SCRATCHED EACH OTHER'S NOSE AND COVERED THEMSELVES
WITH DUST AND GLORY
PRESENTLY THE CONFUSION TOOK FORM AND THROUGH THE
FOG OF BATTLE TOM APPEARED SEATED ASTRIDE THE NEW BOY AND POUNDING HIM
WITH HIS FISTS
HOLLER 'NUFF SAID HE
THE BOY ONLY STRUGGLED TO FREE HIMSELF
HE WAS CRYING MAINLY FROM RAGE
HOLLER 'NUFF AND THE POUNDING WENT ON
AT LAST THE STRANGER GOT OUT A SMOTHERED 'NUFF AND TOM LET HIM UP AND
SAID
NOW THAT'LL LEARN YOU
BETTER LOOK OUT WHO YOU'RE FOOLING WITH NEXT
TIME
THE NEW BOY WENT OFF BRUSHING THE DUST FROM HIS CLOTHES SOBBING
SNUFFLING AND OCCASIONALLY LOOKING BACK AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AND
THREATENING WHAT HE WOULD DO TO TOM THE NEXT TIME HE CAUGHT HIM OUT
TO WHICH TOM RESPONDED WITH JEERS AND STARTED OFF IN HIGH FEATHER AND
AS SOON AS HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE NEW BOY SNATCHED UP A STONE THREW IT
AND HIT HIM BETWEEN THE SHOULDERS AND THEN TURNED TAIL AND RAN LIKE
AN ANTELOPE
TOM CHASED THE TRAITOR HOME AND THUS FOUND OUT WHERE HE
LIVED
HE THEN HELD A POSITION AT THE GATE FOR SOME TIME DARING THE
ENEMY TO COME OUTSIDE BUT THE ENEMY ONLY MADE FACES AT HIM THROUGH THE
WINDOW AND DECLINED
AT LAST THE ENEMY'S MOTHER APPEARED AND CALLED TOM
A BAD VICIOUS VULGAR CHILD AND ORDERED HIM AWAY
SO HE WENT AWAY BUT
HE SAID HE 'LOWED TO LAY FOR THAT BOY
HE GOT HOME PRETTY LATE THAT NIGHT AND WHEN HE CLIMBED CAUTIOUSLY IN
AT THE WINDOW HE UNCOVERED AN AMBUSCADE IN THE PERSON OF HIS AUNT AND
WHEN SHE SAW THE STATE HIS CLOTHES WERE IN HER RESOLUTION TO TURN HIS
SATURDAY HOLIDAY INTO CAPTIVITY AT HARD LABOR BECAME ADAMANTINE IN ITS
FIRMNESS
CHAPTER II
SATURDAY MORNING WAS COME AND ALL THE SUMMER WORLD WAS BRIGHT AND
FRESH AND BRIMMING WITH LIFE
THERE WAS A SONG IN EVERY HEART AND IF
THE HEART WAS YOUNG THE MUSIC ISSUED AT THE LIPS
THERE WAS CHEER IN
EVERY FACE AND A SPRING IN EVERY STEP
THE LOCUST TREES WERE IN BLOOM
AND THE FRAGRANCE OF THE BLOSSOMS FILLED THE AIR
CARDIFF HILL BEYOND
THE VILLAGE AND ABOVE IT WAS GREEN WITH VEGETATION AND IT LAY JUST FAR
ENOUGH AWAY TO SEEM A DELECTABLE LAND DREAMY REPOSEFUL AND INVITING
TOM APPEARED ON THE SIDEWALK WITH A BUCKET OF WHITEWASH AND A
LONG HANDLED BRUSH
HE SURVEYED THE FENCE AND ALL GLADNESS LEFT HIM AND
A DEEP MELANCHOLY SETTLED DOWN UPON HIS SPIRIT
THIRTY YARDS OF BOARD
FENCE NINE FEET HIGH
LIFE TO HIM SEEMED HOLLOW AND EXISTENCE BUT A
BURDEN
SIGHING HE DIPPED HIS BRUSH AND PASSED IT ALONG THE TOPMOST
PLANK REPEATED THE OPERATION DID IT AGAIN COMPARED THE INSIGNIFICANT
WHITEWASHED STREAK WITH THE FAR REACHING CONTINENT OF UNWHITEWASHED
FENCE AND SAT DOWN ON A TREE BOX DISCOURAGED
JIM CAME SKIPPING OUT AT
THE GATE WITH A TIN PAIL AND SINGING BUFFALO GALS
BRINGING WATER FROM
THE TOWN PUMP HAD ALWAYS BEEN HATEFUL WORK IN TOM'S EYES BEFORE BUT
NOW IT DID NOT STRIKE HIM SO
HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS COMPANY AT
THE PUMP
WHITE MULATTO AND NEGRO BOYS AND GIRLS WERE ALWAYS THERE
WAITING THEIR TURNS RESTING TRADING PLAYTHINGS QUARRELLING FIGHTING
SKYLARKING
AND HE REMEMBERED THAT ALTHOUGH THE PUMP WAS ONLY A HUNDRED
AND FIFTY YARDS OFF JIM NEVER GOT BACK WITH A BUCKET OF WATER UNDER AN
HOUR AND EVEN THEN SOMEBODY GENERALLY HAD TO GO AFTER HIM
TOM SAID
SAY JIM I'LL FETCH THE WATER IF YOU'LL WHITEWASH SOME
JIM SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID
CAN'T MARS TOM
OLE MISSIS SHE TOLE ME I GOT TO GO AN' GIT DIS WATER

JIM I'LL GIVE YOU A

JIM BEGAN TO WAVER
WHITE ALLEY JIM AND IT'S A BULLY TAW
MY DAT'S A MIGHTY GAY MARVEL I TELL YOU BUT MARS TOM I'S POWERFUL
'FRAID OLE MISSIS
AND BESIDES IF YOU WILL I'LL SHOW YOU MY SORE TOE
JIM WAS ONLY HUMAN THIS ATTRACTION WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
HE PUT DOWN
HIS PAIL TOOK THE WHITE ALLEY AND BENT OVER THE TOE WITH ABSORBING
INTEREST WHILE THE BANDAGE WAS BEING UNWOUND
IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE
WAS FLYING DOWN THE STREET WITH HIS PAIL AND A TINGLING REAR TOM WAS
WHITEWASHING WITH VIGOR AND AUNT POLLY WAS RETIRING FROM THE FIELD WITH
A SLIPPER IN HER HAND AND TRIUMPH IN HER EYE
BUT TOM'S ENERGY DID NOT LAST
HE BEGAN TO THINK OF THE FUN HE HAD
PLANNED FOR THIS DAY AND HIS SORROWS MULTIPLIED
SOON THE FREE BOYS
WOULD COME TRIPPING ALONG ON ALL SORTS OF DELICIOUS EXPEDITIONS AND
THEY WOULD MAKE A WORLD OF FUN OF HIM FOR HAVING TO WORK THE VERY
THOUGHT OF IT BURNT HIM LIKE FIRE
HE GOT OUT HIS WORLDLY WEALTH AND
EXAMINED IT BITS OF TOYS MARBLES AND TRASH ENOUGH TO BUY AN EXCHANGE
OF WORK MAYBE BUT NOT HALF ENOUGH TO BUY SO MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR
OF PURE FREEDOM
SO HE RETURNED HIS STRAITENED MEANS TO HIS POCKET AND
GAVE UP THE IDEA OF TRYING TO BUY THE BOYS
AT THIS DARK AND HOPELESS
MOMENT AN INSPIRATION BURST UPON HIM NOTHING LESS THAN A GREAT
MAGNIFICENT INSPIRATION
HE TOOK UP HIS BRUSH AND WENT TRANQUILLY TO WORK
BEN ROGERS HOVE IN
SIGHT PRESENTLY THE VERY BOY OF ALL BOYS WHOSE RIDICULE HE HAD BEEN
DREADING
BEN'S GAIT WAS THE HOP SKIP AND JUMP PROOF ENOUGH THAT HIS
HEART WAS LIGHT AND HIS ANTICIPATIONS HIGH
HE WAS EATING AN APPLE AND
GIVING A LONG MELODIOUS WHOOP AT INTERVALS FOLLOWED BY A DEEP TONED
DING DONG DONG DING DONG DONG FOR HE WAS PERSONATING A STEAMBOAT
AS
HE DREW NEAR HE SLACKENED SPEED TOOK THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET LEANED
FAR OVER TO STARBOARD AND ROUNDED TO PONDEROUSLY AND WITH LABORIOUS POMP
AND CIRCUMSTANCE FOR HE WAS PERSONATING THE BIG MISSOURI AND CONSIDERED
HIMSELF TO BE DRAWING NINE FEET OF WATER
HE WAS BOAT AND CAPTAIN AND
ENGINE BELLS COMBINED SO HE HAD TO IMAGINE HIMSELF STANDING ON HIS OWN
HURRICANE DECK GIVING THE ORDERS AND EXECUTING THEM
STOP HER SIR TING A LING LING THE HEADWAY RAN ALMOST OUT AND HE
DREW UP SLOWLY TOWARD THE SIDEWALK
SHIP UP TO BACK TING A LING LING HIS ARMS STRAIGHTENED AND STIFFENED
DOWN HIS SIDES
SET HER BACK ON THE STABBOARD TING A LING LING CHOW CH CHOW WOW
CHOW HIS RIGHT HAND MEAN TIME DESCRIBING STATELY CIRCLES FOR IT WAS
REPRESENTING A FORTY FOOT WHEEL
LET HER GO BACK ON THE LABBOARD TING A LING LING CHOW CH CHOW CHOW

THE STABBOARD STOP HER LET YOUR OUTSIDE TURN OVER SLOW TING A LING LING

YOUR SPRING LINE WHAT'RE YOU ABOUT THERE TAKE A TURN ROUND THAT STUMP
WITH THE BIGHT OF IT STAND BY THAT STAGE NOW LET HER GO DONE WITH
THE ENGINES SIR TING A LING LING SH'T S'H'T SH'T TRYING THE
GAUGE COCKS
TOM WENT ON WHITEWASHING PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE STEAMBOAT
BEN STARED
A MOMENT AND THEN SAID HI YI YOU'RE UP A STUMP AIN'T YOU
NO ANSWER
TOM SURVEYED HIS LAST TOUCH WITH THE EYE OF AN ARTIST THEN
HE GAVE HIS BRUSH ANOTHER GENTLE SWEEP AND SURVEYED THE RESULT AS
BEFORE
BEN RANGED UP ALONGSIDE OF HIM
TOM'S MOUTH WATERED FOR THE
APPLE BUT HE STUCK TO HIS WORK
BEN SAID
HELLO OLD CHAP YOU GOT TO WORK HEY
TOM WHEELED SUDDENLY AND SAID
WHY IT'S YOU BEN I WARN'T NOTICING
SAY I'M GOING IN A SWIMMING I AM
DON'T YOU WISH YOU COULD BUT OF
COURSE YOU'D DRUTHER WORK WOULDN'T YOU COURSE YOU WOULD
TOM CONTEMPLATED THE BOY A BIT AND SAID
WHAT DO YOU CALL WORK
WHY AIN'T THAT WORK
TOM RESUMED HIS WHITEWASHING AND ANSWERED CARELESSLY
WELL MAYBE IT IS AND MAYBE IT AIN'T
ALL I KNOW IS IT SUITS TOM
SAWYER
OH COME NOW YOU DON'T MEAN TO LET ON THAT YOU LIKE IT
THE BRUSH CONTINUED TO MOVE
LIKE IT WELL I DON'T SEE WHY I OUGHTN'T TO LIKE IT
DOES A BOY GET A
CHANCE TO WHITEWASH A FENCE EVERY DAY
THAT PUT THE THING IN A NEW LIGHT
BEN STOPPED NIBBLING HIS APPLE
TOM SWEPT HIS BRUSH DAINTILY BACK AND FORTH STEPPED BACK TO NOTE THE
EFFECT ADDED A TOUCH HERE AND THERE CRITICISED THE EFFECT AGAIN BEN
WATCHING EVERY MOVE AND GETTING MORE AND MORE INTERESTED MORE AND MORE
ABSORBED
PRESENTLY HE SAID
SAY TOM LET ME WHITEWASH A LITTLE
TOM CONSIDERED WAS ABOUT TO CONSENT BUT HE ALTERED HIS MIND
NO NO I RECKON IT WOULDN'T HARDLY DO BEN
YOU SEE AUNT POLLY'S AWFUL
PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS FENCE RIGHT HERE ON THE STREET YOU KNOW BUT IF IT
WAS THE BACK FENCE I WOULDN'T MIND AND SHE WOULDN'T
YES SHE'S AWFUL
PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS FENCE IT'S GOT TO BE DONE VERY CAREFUL I RECKON
THERE AIN'T ONE BOY IN A THOUSAND MAYBE TWO THOUSAND THAT CAN DO IT
THE WAY IT'S GOT TO BE DONE
NO IS THAT SO OH COME NOW LEMME JUST TRY
ONLY JUST A LITTLE I'D LET
YOU IF YOU WAS ME TOM
BEN I'D LIKE TO HONEST INJUN BUT AUNT POLLY WELL JIM WANTED TO DO

OH SHUCKS I'LL BE JUST AS CAREFUL
NOW LEMME TRY
SAY I'LL GIVE YOU
THE CORE OF MY APPLE
WELL HERE NO BEN NOW DON'T
I'M AFEARD
I'LL GIVE YOU ALL OF IT
TOM GAVE UP THE BRUSH WITH RELUCTANCE IN HIS FACE BUT ALACRITY IN HIS
HEART
AND WHILE THE LATE STEAMER BIG MISSOURI WORKED AND SWEATED IN THE
SUN THE RETIRED ARTIST SAT ON A BARREL IN THE SHADE CLOSE BY
DANGLED HIS LEGS MUNCHED HIS APPLE AND PLANNED THE SLAUGHTER OF MORE
INNOCENTS
THERE WAS NO LACK OF MATERIAL BOYS HAPPENED ALONG EVERY
LITTLE WHILE THEY CAME TO JEER BUT REMAINED TO WHITEWASH
BY THE TIME
BEN WAS FAGGED OUT TOM HAD TRADED THE NEXT CHANCE TO BILLY FISHER FOR
A KITE IN GOOD REPAIR AND WHEN HE PLAYED OUT JOHNNY MILLER BOUGHT IN
FOR A DEAD RAT AND A STRING TO SWING IT WITH AND SO ON AND SO ON HOUR
AFTER HOUR
AND WHEN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON CAME FROM BEING A
POOR POVERTY STRICKEN BOY IN THE MORNING TOM WAS LITERALLY ROLLING IN
WEALTH
HE HAD BESIDES THE THINGS BEFORE MENTIONED TWELVE MARBLES PART
OF A JEWS HARP A PIECE OF BLUE BOTTLE GLASS TO LOOK THROUGH A SPOOL
CANNON A KEY THAT WOULDN'T UNLOCK ANYTHING A FRAGMENT OF CHALK A
GLASS STOPPER OF A DECANTER A TIN SOLDIER A COUPLE OF TADPOLES
SIX FIRE CRACKERS A KITTEN WITH ONLY ONE EYE A BRASS DOOR KNOB A
DOG COLLAR BUT NO DOG THE HANDLE OF A KNIFE FOUR PIECES OF ORANGE PEEL
AND A DILAPIDATED OLD WINDOW SASH
HE HAD HAD A NICE GOOD IDLE TIME ALL THE WHILE PLENTY OF COMPANY AND
THE FENCE HAD THREE COATS OF WHITEWASH ON IT IF HE HADN'T RUN OUT OF
WHITEWASH HE WOULD HAVE BANKRUPTED EVERY BOY IN THE VILLAGE
TOM SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NOT SUCH A HOLLOW WORLD AFTER ALL
HE
HAD DISCOVERED A GREAT LAW OF HUMAN ACTION WITHOUT KNOWING IT NAMELY
THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE A MAN OR A BOY COVET A THING IT IS ONLY NECESSARY
TO MAKE THE THING DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN
IF HE HAD BEEN A GREAT AND
WISE PHILOSOPHER LIKE THE WRITER OF THIS BOOK HE WOULD NOW HAVE
COMPREHENDED THAT WORK CONSISTS OF WHATEVER A BODY IS OBLIGED TO DO
AND THAT PLAY CONSISTS OF WHATEVER A BODY IS NOT OBLIGED TO DO
AND
THIS WOULD HELP HIM TO UNDERSTAND WHY CONSTRUCTING ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS OR
PERFORMING ON A TREAD MILL IS WORK WHILE ROLLING TEN PINS OR CLIMBING
MONT BLANC IS ONLY AMUSEMENT
THERE ARE WEALTHY GENTLEMEN IN ENGLAND
WHO DRIVE FOUR HORSE PASSENGER COACHES TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES ON A
DAILY LINE IN THE SUMMER BECAUSE THE PRIVILEGE COSTS THEM CONSIDERABLE
MONEY BUT IF THEY WERE OFFERED WAGES FOR THE SERVICE THAT WOULD TURN
IT INTO WORK AND THEN THEY WOULD RESIGN
THE BOY MUSED AWHILE OVER THE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE
IN HIS WORLDLY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEN WENDED TOWARD HEADQUARTERS TO
REPORT
CHAPTER III
TOM PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE AUNT POLLY WHO WAS SITTING BY AN
OPEN WINDOW IN A PLEASANT REARWARD APARTMENT WHICH WAS BEDROOM
BREAKFAST ROOM DINING ROOM AND LIBRARY COMBINED
THE BALMY SUMMER
AIR THE RESTFUL QUIET THE ODOR OF THE FLOWERS AND THE DROWSING
MURMUR OF THE BEES HAD HAD THEIR EFFECT AND SHE WAS NODDING OVER HER
KNITTING FOR SHE HAD NO COMPANY BUT THE CAT AND IT WAS ASLEEP IN HER
LAP
HER SPECTACLES WERE PROPPED UP ON HER GRAY HEAD FOR SAFETY
SHE HAD
THOUGHT THAT OF COURSE TOM HAD DESERTED LONG AGO AND SHE WONDERED AT
SEEING HIM PLACE HIMSELF IN HER POWER AGAIN IN THIS INTREPID WAY
HE
SAID MAYN'T I GO AND PLAY NOW AUNT
WHAT A'READY HOW MUCH HAVE YOU DONE
IT'S ALL DONE AUNT
TOM DON'T LIE TO ME I CAN'T BEAR IT
I AIN'T AUNT IT IS ALL DONE
AUNT POLLY PLACED SMALL TRUST IN SUCH EVIDENCE
SHE WENT OUT TO SEE FOR
HERSELF AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO FIND TWENTY PER CENT
OF
TOM'S STATEMENT TRUE
WHEN SHE FOUND THE ENTIRE FENCE WHITE WASHED AND
NOT ONLY WHITEWASHED BUT ELABORATELY COATED AND RECOATED AND EVEN A
STREAK ADDED TO THE GROUND HER ASTONISHMENT WAS ALMOST UNSPEAKABLE
SHE
SAID
WELL I NEVER THERE'S NO GETTING ROUND IT YOU CAN WORK WHEN YOU'RE A
MIND TO TOM AND THEN SHE DILUTED THE COMPLIMENT BY ADDING BUT IT'S
POWERFUL SELDOM YOU'RE A MIND TO I'M BOUND TO SAY
WELL GO 'LONG AND
PLAY BUT MIND YOU GET BACK SOME TIME IN A WEEK OR I'LL TAN YOU
SHE WAS SO OVERCOME BY THE SPLENDOR OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT THAT SHE TOOK
HIM INTO THE CLOSET AND SELECTED A CHOICE APPLE AND DELIVERED IT TO HIM
ALONG WITH AN IMPROVING LECTURE UPON THE ADDED VALUE AND FLAVOR A TREAT
TOOK TO ITSELF WHEN IT CAME WITHOUT SIN THROUGH VIRTUOUS EFFORT
AND WHILE SHE CLOSED WITH A HAPPY SCRIPTURAL FLOURISH HE HOOKED A
DOUGHNUT
THEN HE SKIPPED OUT AND SAW SID JUST STARTING UP THE OUTSIDE STAIRWAY
THAT LED TO THE BACK ROOMS ON THE SECOND FLOOR
CLODS WERE HANDY AND
THE AIR WAS FULL OF THEM IN A TWINKLING
THEY RAGED AROUND SID LIKE A
HAIL STORM AND BEFORE AUNT POLLY COULD COLLECT HER SURPRISED FACULTIES
AND SALLY TO THE RESCUE SIX OR SEVEN CLODS HAD TAKEN PERSONAL EFFECT
AND TOM WAS OVER THE FENCE AND GONE
THERE WAS A GATE BUT AS A GENERAL
THING HE WAS TOO CROWDED FOR TIME TO MAKE USE OF IT
HIS SOUL WAS AT
PEACE NOW THAT HE HAD SETTLED WITH SID FOR CALLING ATTENTION TO HIS
BLACK THREAD AND GETTING HIM INTO TROUBLE
TOM SKIRTED THE BLOCK AND CAME ROUND INTO A MUDDY ALLEY THAT LED BY THE
BACK OF HIS AUNT'S COW STABLE
HE PRESENTLY GOT SAFELY BEYOND THE REACH
OF CAPTURE AND PUNISHMENT AND HASTENED TOWARD THE PUBLIC SQUARE OF THE
VILLAGE WHERE TWO MILITARY COMPANIES OF BOYS HAD MET FOR CONFLICT
ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS APPOINTMENT
TOM WAS GENERAL OF ONE OF THESE
ARMIES JOE HARPER A BOSOM FRIEND GENERAL OF THE OTHER
THESE TWO
GREAT COMMANDERS DID NOT CONDESCEND TO FIGHT IN PERSON THAT BEING BETTER
SUITED TO THE STILL SMALLER FRY BUT SAT TOGETHER ON AN EMINENCE
AND CONDUCTED THE FIELD OPERATIONS BY ORDERS DELIVERED THROUGH
AIDES DE CAMP
TOM'S ARMY WON A GREAT VICTORY AFTER A LONG AND
HARD FOUGHT BATTLE
THEN THE DEAD WERE COUNTED PRISONERS EXCHANGED
THE TERMS OF THE NEXT DISAGREEMENT AGREED UPON AND THE DAY FOR THE
NECESSARY BATTLE APPOINTED AFTER WHICH THE ARMIES FELL INTO LINE AND
MARCHED AWAY AND TOM TURNED HOMEWARD ALONE
AS HE WAS PASSING BY THE HOUSE WHERE JEFF THATCHER LIVED HE SAW A NEW
GIRL IN THE GARDEN A LOVELY LITTLE BLUE EYED CREATURE WITH YELLOW
HAIR PLAITED INTO TWO LONG TAILS WHITE SUMMER FROCK AND EMBROIDERED
PAN TALETTES
THE FRESH CROWNED HERO FELL WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT
A
CERTAIN AMY LAWRENCE VANISHED OUT OF HIS HEART AND LEFT NOT EVEN A
MEMORY OF HERSELF BEHIND
HE HAD THOUGHT HE LOVED HER TO DISTRACTION
HE HAD REGARDED HIS PASSION AS ADORATION AND BEHOLD IT WAS ONLY A POOR
LITTLE EVANESCENT PARTIALITY
HE HAD BEEN MONTHS WINNING HER SHE HAD
CONFESSED HARDLY A WEEK AGO HE HAD BEEN THE HAPPIEST AND THE PROUDEST
BOY IN THE WORLD ONLY SEVEN SHORT DAYS AND HERE IN ONE INSTANT OF TIME
SHE HAD GONE OUT OF HIS HEART LIKE A CASUAL STRANGER WHOSE VISIT IS
DONE
HE WORSHIPPED THIS NEW ANGEL WITH FURTIVE EYE TILL HE SAW THAT SHE HAD
DISCOVERED HIM THEN HE PRETENDED HE DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS PRESENT AND
BEGAN TO SHOW OFF IN ALL SORTS OF ABSURD BOYISH WAYS IN ORDER TO WIN
HER ADMIRATION
HE KEPT UP THIS GROTESQUE FOOLISHNESS FOR SOME TIME
BUT BY AND BY WHILE HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF SOME DANGEROUS GYMNASTIC
PERFORMANCES HE GLANCED ASIDE AND SAW THAT THE LITTLE GIRL WAS WENDING
HER WAY TOWARD THE HOUSE
TOM CAME UP TO THE FENCE AND LEANED ON IT
GRIEVING AND HOPING SHE WOULD TARRY YET AWHILE LONGER
SHE HALTED A
MOMENT ON THE STEPS AND THEN MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR
TOM HEAVED A GREAT
SIGH AS SHE PUT HER FOOT ON THE THRESHOLD
BUT HIS FACE LIT UP
RIGHT AWAY FOR SHE TOSSED A PANSY OVER THE FENCE A MOMENT BEFORE SHE
DISAPPEARED
THE BOY RAN AROUND AND STOPPED WITHIN A FOOT OR TWO OF THE FLOWER AND
THEN SHADED HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO LOOK DOWN STREET AS
IF HE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING OF INTEREST GOING ON IN THAT DIRECTION
PRESENTLY HE PICKED UP A STRAW AND BEGAN TRYING TO BALANCE IT ON HIS
NOSE WITH HIS HEAD TILTED FAR BACK AND AS HE MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE
IN HIS EFFORTS HE EDGED NEARER AND NEARER TOWARD THE PANSY FINALLY HIS
BARE FOOT RESTED UPON IT HIS PLIANT TOES CLOSED UPON IT AND HE HOPPED
AWAY WITH THE TREASURE AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE CORNER
BUT ONLY FOR A
MINUTE ONLY WHILE HE COULD BUTTON THE FLOWER INSIDE HIS JACKET NEXT
HIS HEART OR NEXT HIS STOMACH POSSIBLY FOR HE WAS NOT MUCH POSTED IN
ANATOMY AND NOT HYPERCRITICAL ANYWAY
HE RETURNED NOW AND HUNG ABOUT THE FENCE TILL NIGHTFALL SHOWING
OFF AS BEFORE BUT THE GIRL NEVER EXHIBITED HERSELF AGAIN THOUGH TOM
COMFORTED HIMSELF A LITTLE WITH THE HOPE THAT SHE HAD BEEN NEAR SOME
WINDOW MEANTIME AND BEEN AWARE OF HIS ATTENTIONS
FINALLY HE STRODE
HOME RELUCTANTLY WITH HIS POOR HEAD FULL OF VISIONS
ALL THROUGH SUPPER HIS SPIRITS WERE SO HIGH THAT HIS AUNT WONDERED WHAT
HAD GOT INTO THE CHILD HE TOOK A GOOD SCOLDING ABOUT CLODDING SID AND
DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT IN THE LEAST
HE TRIED TO STEAL SUGAR UNDER HIS
AUNT'S VERY NOSE AND GOT HIS KNUCKLES RAPPED FOR IT
HE SAID
AUNT YOU DON'T WHACK SID WHEN HE TAKES IT
WELL SID DON'T TORMENT A BODY THE WAY YOU DO
YOU'D BE ALWAYS INTO
THAT SUGAR IF I WARN'T WATCHING YOU
PRESENTLY SHE STEPPED INTO THE KITCHEN AND SID HAPPY IN HIS IMMUNITY
REACHED FOR THE SUGAR BOWL A SORT OF GLORYING OVER TOM WHICH WAS
WELLNIGH UNBEARABLE
BUT SID'S FINGERS SLIPPED AND THE BOWL DROPPED AND
BROKE
TOM WAS IN ECSTASIES
IN SUCH ECSTASIES THAT HE EVEN CONTROLLED
HIS TONGUE AND WAS SILENT
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT SPEAK A
WORD EVEN WHEN HIS AUNT CAME IN BUT WOULD SIT PERFECTLY STILL TILL SHE
ASKED WHO DID THE MISCHIEF AND THEN HE WOULD TELL AND THERE WOULD BE
NOTHING SO GOOD IN THE WORLD AS TO SEE THAT PET MODEL CATCH IT HE WAS
SO BRIMFUL OF EXULTATION THAT HE COULD HARDLY HOLD HIMSELF WHEN THE OLD
LADY CAME BACK AND STOOD ABOVE THE WRECK DISCHARGING LIGHTNINGS OF WRATH
FROM OVER HER SPECTACLES
HE SAID TO HIMSELF NOW IT'S COMING AND THE
NEXT INSTANT HE WAS SPRAWLING ON THE FLOOR THE POTENT PALM WAS UPLIFTED
TO STRIKE AGAIN WHEN TOM CRIED OUT
HOLD ON NOW WHAT 'ER YOU BELTING ME FOR SID BROKE IT
AUNT POLLY PAUSED PERPLEXED AND TOM LOOKED FOR HEALING PITY
BUT WHEN
SHE GOT HER TONGUE AGAIN SHE ONLY SAID
UMF WELL YOU DIDN'T GET A LICK AMISS I RECKON
YOU BEEN INTO SOME
OTHER AUDACIOUS MISCHIEF WHEN I WASN'T AROUND LIKE ENOUGH
THEN HER CONSCIENCE REPROACHED HER AND SHE YEARNED TO SAY SOMETHING
KIND AND LOVING BUT SHE JUDGED THAT THIS WOULD BE CONSTRUED INTO A
CONFESSION THAT SHE HAD BEEN IN THE WRONG AND DISCIPLINE FORBADE THAT
SO SHE KEPT SILENCE AND WENT ABOUT HER AFFAIRS WITH A TROUBLED HEART
TOM SULKED IN A CORNER AND EXALTED HIS WOES
HE KNEW THAT IN HER HEART
HIS AUNT WAS ON HER KNEES TO HIM AND HE WAS MOROSELY GRATIFIED BY THE
CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT
HE WOULD HANG OUT NO SIGNALS HE WOULD TAKE NOTICE
OF NONE
HE KNEW THAT A YEARNING GLANCE FELL UPON HIM NOW AND THEN
THROUGH A FILM OF TEARS BUT HE REFUSED RECOGNITION OF IT
HE PICTURED
HIMSELF LYING SICK UNTO DEATH AND HIS AUNT BENDING OVER HIM BESEECHING
ONE LITTLE FORGIVING WORD BUT HE WOULD TURN HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND
DIE WITH THAT WORD UNSAID
AH HOW WOULD SHE FEEL THEN AND HE PICTURED
HIMSELF BROUGHT HOME FROM THE RIVER DEAD WITH HIS CURLS ALL WET AND
HIS SORE HEART AT REST
HOW SHE WOULD THROW HERSELF UPON HIM AND HOW
HER TEARS WOULD FALL LIKE RAIN AND HER LIPS PRAY GOD TO GIVE HER BACK
HER BOY AND SHE WOULD NEVER NEVER ABUSE HIM ANY MORE BUT HE WOULD
LIE THERE COLD AND WHITE AND MAKE NO SIGN A POOR LITTLE SUFFERER WHOSE
GRIEFS WERE AT AN END
HE SO WORKED UPON HIS FEELINGS WITH THE PATHOS OF
THESE DREAMS THAT HE HAD TO KEEP SWALLOWING HE WAS SO LIKE TO CHOKE
AND HIS EYES SWAM IN A BLUR OF WATER WHICH OVERFLOWED WHEN HE WINKED
AND RAN DOWN AND TRICKLED FROM THE END OF HIS NOSE
AND SUCH A LUXURY TO
HIM WAS THIS PETTING OF HIS SORROWS THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE ANY
WORLDLY CHEERINESS OR ANY GRATING DELIGHT INTRUDE UPON IT IT WAS TOO
SACRED FOR SUCH CONTACT AND SO PRESENTLY WHEN HIS COUSIN MARY DANCED
IN ALL ALIVE WITH THE JOY OF SEEING HOME AGAIN AFTER AN AGE LONG VISIT
OF ONE WEEK TO THE COUNTRY HE GOT UP AND MOVED IN CLOUDS AND DARKNESS
OUT AT ONE DOOR AS SHE BROUGHT SONG AND SUNSHINE IN AT THE OTHER
HE WANDERED FAR FROM THE ACCUSTOMED HAUNTS OF BOYS AND SOUGHT DESOLATE
PLACES THAT WERE IN HARMONY WITH HIS SPIRIT
A LOG RAFT IN THE RIVER
INVITED HIM AND HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ITS OUTER EDGE AND CONTEMPLATED
THE DREARY VASTNESS OF THE STREAM WISHING THE WHILE THAT HE COULD
ONLY BE DROWNED ALL AT ONCE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT UNDERGOING THE
UNCOMFORTABLE ROUTINE DEVISED BY NATURE
THEN HE THOUGHT OF HIS FLOWER
HE GOT IT OUT RUMPLED AND WILTED AND IT MIGHTILY INCREASED HIS DISMAL
FELICITY
HE WONDERED IF SHE WOULD PITY HIM IF SHE KNEW WOULD SHE
CRY AND WISH THAT SHE HAD A RIGHT TO PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND
COMFORT HIM OR WOULD SHE TURN COLDLY AWAY LIKE ALL THE HOLLOW WORLD
THIS PICTURE BROUGHT SUCH AN AGONY OF PLEASURABLE SUFFERING THAT HE
WORKED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN HIS MIND AND SET IT UP IN NEW AND
VARIED LIGHTS TILL HE WORE IT THREADBARE
AT LAST HE ROSE UP SIGHING
AND DEPARTED IN THE DARKNESS
ABOUT HALF PAST NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK HE CAME ALONG THE DESERTED STREET TO
WHERE THE ADORED UNKNOWN LIVED HE PAUSED A MOMENT NO SOUND FELL UPON
HIS LISTENING EAR A CANDLE WAS CASTING A DULL GLOW UPON THE CURTAIN
OF A SECOND STORY WINDOW
WAS THE SACRED PRESENCE THERE HE CLIMBED THE
FENCE THREADED HIS STEALTHY WAY THROUGH THE PLANTS TILL HE STOOD UNDER
THAT WINDOW HE LOOKED UP AT IT LONG AND WITH EMOTION THEN HE LAID HIM
DOWN ON THE GROUND UNDER IT DISPOSING HIMSELF UPON HIS BACK WITH HIS
HANDS CLASPED UPON HIS BREAST AND HOLDING HIS POOR WILTED FLOWER
AND THUS HE WOULD DIE OUT IN THE COLD WORLD WITH NO SHELTER OVER HIS
HOMELESS HEAD NO FRIENDLY HAND TO WIPE THE DEATH DAMPS FROM HIS BROW
NO LOVING FACE TO BEND PITYINGLY OVER HIM WHEN THE GREAT AGONY CAME
AND
THUS SHE WOULD SEE HIM WHEN SHE LOOKED OUT UPON THE GLAD MORNING AND
OH WOULD SHE DROP ONE LITTLE TEAR UPON HIS POOR LIFELESS FORM WOULD
SHE HEAVE ONE LITTLE SIGH TO SEE A BRIGHT YOUNG LIFE SO RUDELY BLIGHTED
SO UNTIMELY CUT DOWN
THE WINDOW WENT UP A MAID SERVANT'S DISCORDANT VOICE PROFANED THE HOLY
CALM AND A DELUGE OF WATER DRENCHED THE PRONE MARTYR'S REMAINS
THE STRANGLING HERO SPRANG UP WITH A RELIEVING SNORT
THERE WAS A WHIZ
AS OF A MISSILE IN THE AIR MINGLED WITH THE MURMUR OF A CURSE A SOUND
AS OF SHIVERING GLASS FOLLOWED AND A SMALL VAGUE FORM WENT OVER THE
FENCE AND SHOT AWAY IN THE GLOOM
NOT LONG AFTER AS TOM ALL UNDRESSED FOR BED WAS SURVEYING HIS
DRENCHED GARMENTS BY THE LIGHT OF A TALLOW DIP SID WOKE UP BUT IF HE
HAD ANY DIM IDEA OF MAKING ANY REFERENCES TO ALLUSIONS HE THOUGHT
BETTER OF IT AND HELD HIS PEACE FOR THERE WAS DANGER IN TOM'S EYE
TOM TURNED IN WITHOUT THE ADDED VEXATION OF PRAYERS AND SID MADE MENTAL
NOTE OF THE OMISSION
CHAPTER IV
THE SUN ROSE UPON A TRANQUIL WORLD AND BEAMED DOWN UPON THE PEACEFUL
VILLAGE LIKE A BENEDICTION
BREAKFAST OVER AUNT POLLY HAD FAMILY
WORSHIP IT BEGAN WITH A PRAYER BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP OF SOLID
COURSES OF SCRIPTURAL QUOTATIONS WELDED TOGETHER WITH A THIN MORTAR OF
ORIGINALITY AND FROM THE SUMMIT OF THIS SHE DELIVERED A GRIM CHAPTER OF
THE MOSAIC LAW AS FROM SINAI
THEN TOM GIRDED UP HIS LOINS SO TO SPEAK AND WENT TO WORK TO GET
HIS VERSES SID HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON DAYS BEFORE
TOM BENT ALL HIS
ENERGIES TO THE MEMORIZING OF FIVE VERSES AND HE CHOSE PART OF THE
SERMON ON THE MOUNT BECAUSE HE COULD FIND NO VERSES THAT WERE SHORTER
AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR TOM HAD A VAGUE GENERAL IDEA OF HIS LESSON
BUT NO MORE FOR HIS MIND WAS TRAVERSING THE WHOLE FIELD OF HUMAN
THOUGHT AND HIS HANDS WERE BUSY WITH DISTRACTING RECREATIONS
MARY TOOK
HIS BOOK TO HEAR HIM RECITE AND HE TRIED TO FIND HIS WAY THROUGH THE
FOG
BLESSED ARE THE A A
POOR
YES POOR BLESSED ARE THE POOR A A
IN SPIRIT
IN SPIRIT BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT FOR THEY THEY
THEIRS
FOR THEIRS
BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM
OF HEAVEN
BLESSED ARE THEY THAT MOURN FOR THEY THEY
SH
FOR THEY A
S H A
FOR THEY S H OH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
SHALL
OH SHALL FOR THEY SHALL FOR THEY SHALL A A SHALL MOURN A A BLESSED
ARE THEY THAT SHALL THEY THAT A THEY THAT SHALL MOURN FOR THEY
SHALL A SHALL WHAT WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME MARY WHAT DO YOU WANT TO
BE SO MEAN FOR
OH TOM YOU POOR THICK HEADED THING I'M NOT TEASING YOU
I WOULDN'T
DO THAT
YOU MUST GO AND LEARN IT AGAIN
DON'T YOU BE DISCOURAGED TOM
YOU'LL MANAGE IT AND IF YOU DO I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING EVER SO NICE
THERE NOW THAT'S A GOOD BOY
ALL RIGHT WHAT IS IT MARY TELL ME WHAT IT IS
NEVER YOU MIND TOM
YOU KNOW IF I SAY IT'S NICE IT IS NICE
YOU BET YOU THAT'S SO MARY
ALL RIGHT I'LL TACKLE IT AGAIN
AND HE DID TACKLE IT AGAIN AND UNDER THE DOUBLE PRESSURE OF CURIOSITY
AND PROSPECTIVE GAIN HE DID IT WITH SUCH SPIRIT THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED A
SHINING SUCCESS
MARY GAVE HIM A BRAND NEW BARLOW KNIFE WORTH TWELVE
AND A HALF CENTS AND THE CONVULSION OF DELIGHT THAT SWEPT HIS SYSTEM
SHOOK HIM TO HIS FOUNDATIONS
TRUE THE KNIFE WOULD NOT CUT ANYTHING
BUT IT WAS A SURE ENOUGH BARLOW AND THERE WAS INCONCEIVABLE GRANDEUR
IN THAT THOUGH WHERE THE WESTERN BOYS EVER GOT THE IDEA THAT SUCH A
WEAPON COULD POSSIBLY BE COUNTERFEITED TO ITS INJURY IS AN IMPOSING
MYSTERY AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN SO PERHAPS
TOM CONTRIVED TO SCARIFY THE
CUPBOARD WITH IT AND WAS ARRANGING TO BEGIN ON THE BUREAU WHEN HE WAS
CALLED OFF TO DRESS FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL
MARY GAVE HIM A TIN BASIN OF WATER AND A PIECE OF SOAP AND HE WENT
OUTSIDE THE DOOR AND SET THE BASIN ON A LITTLE BENCH THERE THEN HE
DIPPED THE SOAP IN THE WATER AND LAID IT DOWN TURNED UP HIS SLEEVES
POURED OUT THE WATER ON THE GROUND GENTLY AND THEN ENTERED THE KITCHEN
AND BEGAN TO WIPE HIS FACE DILIGENTLY ON THE TOWEL BEHIND THE DOOR
BUT
MARY REMOVED THE TOWEL AND SAID
NOW AIN'T YOU ASHAMED TOM
YOU MUSTN'T BE SO BAD
WATER WON'T HURT
YOU
TOM WAS A TRIFLE DISCONCERTED
THE BASIN WAS REFILLED AND THIS TIME HE
STOOD OVER IT A LITTLE WHILE GATHERING RESOLUTION TOOK IN A BIG BREATH
AND BEGAN
WHEN HE ENTERED THE KITCHEN PRESENTLY WITH BOTH EYES SHUT
AND GROPING FOR THE TOWEL WITH HIS HANDS AN HONORABLE TESTIMONY OF
SUDS AND WATER WAS DRIPPING FROM HIS FACE
BUT WHEN HE EMERGED FROM
THE TOWEL HE WAS NOT YET SATISFACTORY FOR THE CLEAN TERRITORY STOPPED
SHORT AT HIS CHIN AND HIS JAWS LIKE A MASK BELOW AND BEYOND THIS LINE
THERE WAS A DARK EXPANSE OF UNIRRIGATED SOIL THAT SPREAD DOWNWARD IN
FRONT AND BACKWARD AROUND HIS NECK
MARY TOOK HIM IN HAND AND WHEN SHE
WAS DONE WITH HIM HE WAS A MAN AND A BROTHER WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF
COLOR AND HIS SATURATED HAIR WAS NEATLY BRUSHED AND ITS SHORT CURLS
WROUGHT INTO A DAINTY AND SYMMETRICAL GENERAL EFFECT
HE PRIVATELY
SMOOTHED OUT THE CURLS WITH LABOR AND DIFFICULTY AND PLASTERED HIS
HAIR CLOSE DOWN TO HIS HEAD FOR HE HELD CURLS TO BE EFFEMINATE AND HIS
OWN FILLED HIS LIFE WITH BITTERNESS THEN MARY GOT OUT A SUIT OF HIS
CLOTHING THAT HAD BEEN USED ONLY ON SUNDAYS DURING TWO YEARS THEY WERE
SIMPLY CALLED HIS OTHER CLOTHES AND SO BY THAT WE KNOW THE SIZE OF HIS
WARDROBE
THE GIRL PUT HIM TO RIGHTS AFTER HE HAD DRESSED HIMSELF
SHE BUTTONED HIS NEAT ROUNDABOUT UP TO HIS CHIN TURNED HIS VAST SHIRT
COLLAR DOWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS BRUSHED HIM OFF AND CROWNED HIM WITH
HIS SPECKLED STRAW HAT
HE NOW LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY IMPROVED AND
UNCOMFORTABLE
HE WAS FULLY AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS HE LOOKED FOR THERE
WAS A RESTRAINT ABOUT WHOLE CLOTHES AND CLEANLINESS THAT GALLED HIM
HE
HOPED THAT MARY WOULD FORGET HIS SHOES BUT THE HOPE WAS BLIGHTED SHE
COATED THEM THOROUGHLY WITH TALLOW AS WAS THE CUSTOM AND BROUGHT
THEM OUT
HE LOST HIS TEMPER AND SAID HE WAS ALWAYS BEING MADE TO DO
EVERYTHING HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO
BUT MARY SAID PERSUASIVELY
PLEASE TOM THAT'S A GOOD BOY
SO HE GOT INTO THE SHOES SNARLING
MARY WAS SOON READY AND THE THREE
CHILDREN SET OUT FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL A PLACE THAT TOM HATED WITH HIS WHOLE
HEART BUT SID AND MARY WERE FOND OF IT
SABBATH SCHOOL HOURS WERE FROM NINE TO HALF PAST TEN AND THEN CHURCH
SERVICE
TWO OF THE CHILDREN ALWAYS REMAINED FOR THE SERMON VOLUNTARILY
AND THE OTHER ALWAYS REMAINED TOO FOR STRONGER REASONS
THE CHURCH'S
HIGH BACKED UNCUSHIONED PEWS WOULD SEAT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PERSONS
THE EDIFICE WAS BUT A SMALL PLAIN AFFAIR WITH A SORT OF PINE BOARD
TREE BOX ON TOP OF IT FOR A STEEPLE
AT THE DOOR TOM DROPPED BACK A STEP
AND ACCOSTED A SUNDAY DRESSED COMRADE
SAY BILLY GOT A YALLER TICKET
YES
WHAT'LL YOU TAKE FOR HER
WHAT'LL YOU GIVE
PIECE OF LICKRISH AND A FISH HOOK
LESS SEE 'EM
TOM EXHIBITED
THEY WERE SATISFACTORY AND THE PROPERTY CHANGED HANDS
THEN TOM TRADED A COUPLE OF WHITE ALLEYS FOR THREE RED TICKETS AND SOME
SMALL TRIFLE OR OTHER FOR A COUPLE OF BLUE ONES
HE WAYLAID OTHER
BOYS AS THEY CAME AND WENT ON BUYING TICKETS OF VARIOUS COLORS TEN
OR FIFTEEN MINUTES LONGER
HE ENTERED THE CHURCH NOW WITH A SWARM
OF CLEAN AND NOISY BOYS AND GIRLS PROCEEDED TO HIS SEAT AND STARTED
A QUARREL WITH THE FIRST BOY THAT CAME HANDY
THE TEACHER A GRAVE
ELDERLY MAN INTERFERED THEN TURNED HIS BACK A MOMENT AND TOM PULLED A
BOY'S HAIR IN THE NEXT BENCH AND WAS ABSORBED IN HIS BOOK WHEN THE BOY
TURNED AROUND STUCK A PIN IN ANOTHER BOY PRESENTLY IN ORDER TO HEAR
HIM SAY OUCH AND GOT A NEW REPRIMAND FROM HIS TEACHER
TOM'S WHOLE
CLASS WERE OF A PATTERN RESTLESS NOISY AND TROUBLESOME
WHEN THEY CAME
TO RECITE THEIR LESSONS NOT ONE OF THEM KNEW HIS VERSES PERFECTLY BUT
HAD TO BE PROMPTED ALL ALONG
HOWEVER THEY WORRIED THROUGH AND EACH
GOT HIS REWARD IN SMALL BLUE TICKETS EACH WITH A PASSAGE OF SCRIPTURE
ON IT EACH BLUE TICKET WAS PAY FOR TWO VERSES OF THE RECITATION
TEN
BLUE TICKETS EQUALLED A RED ONE AND COULD BE EXCHANGED FOR IT TEN RED
TICKETS EQUALLED A YELLOW ONE FOR TEN YELLOW TICKETS THE SUPERINTENDENT
GAVE A VERY PLAINLY BOUND BIBLE WORTH FORTY CENTS IN THOSE EASY
TIMES TO THE PUPIL
HOW MANY OF MY READERS WOULD HAVE THE INDUSTRY AND
APPLICATION TO MEMORIZE TWO THOUSAND VERSES EVEN FOR A DORE BIBLE AND
YET MARY HAD ACQUIRED TWO BIBLES IN THIS WAY IT WAS THE PATIENT WORK OF
TWO YEARS AND A BOY OF GERMAN PARENTAGE HAD WON FOUR OR FIVE
HE ONCE
RECITED THREE THOUSAND VERSES WITHOUT STOPPING BUT THE STRAIN UPON HIS
MENTAL FACULTIES WAS TOO GREAT AND HE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT
FROM THAT DAY FORTH A GRIEVOUS MISFORTUNE FOR THE SCHOOL FOR ON GREAT
OCCASIONS BEFORE COMPANY THE SUPERINTENDENT AS TOM EXPRESSED IT
HAD ALWAYS MADE THIS BOY COME OUT AND SPREAD HIMSELF ONLY THE OLDER
PUPILS MANAGED TO KEEP THEIR TICKETS AND STICK TO THEIR TEDIOUS WORK
LONG ENOUGH TO GET A BIBLE AND SO THE DELIVERY OF ONE OF THESE PRIZES
WAS A RARE AND NOTEWORTHY CIRCUMSTANCE THE SUCCESSFUL PUPIL WAS SO
GREAT AND CONSPICUOUS FOR THAT DAY THAT ON THE SPOT EVERY SCHOLAR'S
HEART WAS FIRED WITH A FRESH AMBITION THAT OFTEN LASTED A COUPLE
OF WEEKS
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TOM'S MENTAL STOMACH HAD NEVER REALLY
HUNGERED FOR ONE OF THOSE PRIZES BUT UNQUESTIONABLY HIS ENTIRE BEING
HAD FOR MANY A DAY LONGED FOR THE GLORY AND THE ECLAT THAT CAME WITH IT
IN DUE COURSE THE SUPERINTENDENT STOOD UP IN FRONT OF THE PULPIT WITH
A CLOSED HYMN BOOK IN HIS HAND AND HIS FOREFINGER INSERTED BETWEEN ITS
LEAVES AND COMMANDED ATTENTION
WHEN A SUNDAY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT
MAKES HIS CUSTOMARY LITTLE SPEECH A HYMN BOOK IN THE HAND IS AS
NECESSARY AS IS THE INEVITABLE SHEET OF MUSIC IN THE HAND OF A SINGER
WHO STANDS FORWARD ON THE PLATFORM AND SINGS A SOLO AT A CONCERT THOUGH
WHY IS A MYSTERY FOR NEITHER THE HYMN BOOK NOR THE SHEET OF MUSIC
IS EVER REFERRED TO BY THE SUFFERER
THIS SUPERINTENDENT WAS A SLIM
CREATURE OF THIRTY FIVE WITH A SANDY GOATEE AND SHORT SANDY HAIR HE
WORE A STIFF STANDING COLLAR WHOSE UPPER EDGE ALMOST REACHED HIS EARS
AND WHOSE SHARP POINTS CURVED FORWARD ABREAST THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH A
FENCE THAT COMPELLED A STRAIGHT LOOKOUT AHEAD AND A TURNING OF THE
WHOLE BODY WHEN A SIDE VIEW WAS REQUIRED HIS CHIN WAS PROPPED ON A
SPREADING CRAVAT WHICH WAS AS BROAD AND AS LONG AS A BANK NOTE AND HAD
FRINGED ENDS HIS BOOT TOES WERE TURNED SHARPLY UP IN THE FASHION
OF THE DAY LIKE SLEIGH RUNNERS AN EFFECT PATIENTLY AND LABORIOUSLY
PRODUCED BY THE YOUNG MEN BY SITTING WITH THEIR TOES PRESSED AGAINST A
WALL FOR HOURS TOGETHER
MR
WALTERS WAS VERY EARNEST OF MIEN AND VERY
SINCERE AND HONEST AT HEART AND HE HELD SACRED THINGS AND PLACES
IN SUCH REVERENCE AND SO SEPARATED THEM FROM WORLDLY MATTERS THAT
UNCONSCIOUSLY TO HIMSELF HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL VOICE HAD ACQUIRED A PECULIAR
INTONATION WHICH WAS WHOLLY ABSENT ON WEEK DAYS
HE BEGAN AFTER THIS
FASHION
NOW CHILDREN I WANT YOU ALL TO SIT UP JUST AS STRAIGHT AND PRETTY AS
YOU CAN AND GIVE ME ALL YOUR ATTENTION FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THERE THAT
IS IT
THAT IS THE WAY GOOD LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS SHOULD DO
I SEE ONE
LITTLE GIRL WHO IS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW I AM AFRAID SHE THINKS I
AM OUT THERE SOMEWHERE PERHAPS UP IN ONE OF THE TREES MAKING A SPEECH
TO THE LITTLE BIRDS
APPLAUSIVE TITTER I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW GOOD IT
MAKES ME FEEL TO SEE SO MANY BRIGHT CLEAN LITTLE FACES ASSEMBLED IN A
PLACE LIKE THIS LEARNING TO DO RIGHT AND BE GOOD AND SO FORTH AND SO
ON
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SET DOWN THE REST OF THE ORATION
IT WAS OF A
PATTERN WHICH DOES NOT VARY AND SO IT IS FAMILIAR TO US ALL
THE LATTER THIRD OF THE SPEECH WAS MARRED BY THE RESUMPTION OF FIGHTS
AND OTHER RECREATIONS AMONG CERTAIN OF THE BAD BOYS AND BY FIDGETINGS
AND WHISPERINGS THAT EXTENDED FAR AND WIDE WASHING EVEN TO THE BASES OF
ISOLATED AND INCORRUPTIBLE ROCKS LIKE SID AND MARY
BUT NOW EVERY SOUND
CEASED SUDDENLY WITH THE SUBSIDENCE OF MR
WALTERS' VOICE AND THE
CONCLUSION OF THE SPEECH WAS RECEIVED WITH A BURST OF SILENT GRATITUDE
A GOOD PART OF THE WHISPERING HAD BEEN OCCASIONED BY AN EVENT WHICH WAS
MORE OR LESS RARE THE ENTRANCE OF VISITORS LAWYER THATCHER ACCOMPANIED
BY A VERY FEEBLE AND AGED MAN A FINE PORTLY MIDDLE AGED GENTLEMAN
WITH IRON GRAY HAIR AND A DIGNIFIED LADY WHO WAS DOUBTLESS THE LATTER'S
WIFE
THE LADY WAS LEADING A CHILD
TOM HAD BEEN RESTLESS AND FULL OF
CHAFINGS AND REPININGS CONSCIENCE SMITTEN TOO HE COULD NOT MEET AMY
LAWRENCE'S EYE HE COULD NOT BROOK HER LOVING GAZE
BUT WHEN HE SAW THIS
SMALL NEWCOMER HIS SOUL WAS ALL ABLAZE WITH BLISS IN A MOMENT
THE NEXT
MOMENT HE WAS SHOWING OFF WITH ALL HIS MIGHT CUFFING BOYS PULLING
HAIR MAKING FACES IN A WORD USING EVERY ART THAT SEEMED LIKELY TO
FASCINATE A GIRL AND WIN HER APPLAUSE
HIS EXALTATION HAD BUT ONE
ALLOY THE MEMORY OF HIS HUMILIATION IN THIS ANGEL'S GARDEN AND THAT
RECORD IN SAND WAS FAST WASHING OUT UNDER THE WAVES OF HAPPINESS THAT
WERE SWEEPING OVER IT NOW
THE VISITORS WERE GIVEN THE HIGHEST SEAT OF HONOR AND AS SOON AS MR
WALTERS' SPEECH WAS FINISHED HE INTRODUCED THEM TO THE SCHOOL
THE
MIDDLE AGED MAN TURNED OUT TO BE A PRODIGIOUS PERSONAGE NO LESS A ONE
THAN THE COUNTY JUDGE ALTOGETHER THE MOST AUGUST CREATION THESE CHILDREN
HAD EVER LOOKED UPON AND THEY WONDERED WHAT KIND OF MATERIAL HE WAS MADE
OF AND THEY HALF WANTED TO HEAR HIM ROAR AND WERE HALF AFRAID HE MIGHT
TOO
HE WAS FROM CONSTANTINOPLE TWELVE MILES AWAY SO HE HAD TRAVELLED
AND SEEN THE WORLD THESE VERY EYES HAD LOOKED UPON THE COUNTY
COURT HOUSE WHICH WAS SAID TO HAVE A TIN ROOF
THE AWE WHICH THESE
REFLECTIONS INSPIRED WAS ATTESTED BY THE IMPRESSIVE SILENCE AND THE
RANKS OF STARING EYES
THIS WAS THE GREAT JUDGE THATCHER BROTHER OF
THEIR OWN LAWYER
JEFF THATCHER IMMEDIATELY WENT FORWARD TO BE FAMILIAR
WITH THE GREAT MAN AND BE ENVIED BY THE SCHOOL
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUSIC
TO HIS SOUL TO HEAR THE WHISPERINGS
LOOK AT HIM JIM HE'S A GOING UP THERE
SAY LOOK HE'S A GOING TO
SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM HE IS SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM BY JINGS DON'T YOU
WISH YOU WAS JEFF
MR
WALTERS FELL TO SHOWING OFF WITH ALL SORTS OF OFFICIAL BUSTLINGS
AND ACTIVITIES GIVING ORDERS DELIVERING JUDGMENTS DISCHARGING
DIRECTIONS HERE THERE EVERYWHERE THAT HE COULD FIND A TARGET
THE
LIBRARIAN SHOWED OFF RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER WITH HIS ARMS FULL OF
BOOKS AND MAKING A DEAL OF THE SPLUTTER AND FUSS THAT INSECT AUTHORITY
DELIGHTS IN
THE YOUNG LADY TEACHERS SHOWED OFF BENDING SWEETLY OVER
PUPILS THAT WERE LATELY BEING BOXED LIFTING PRETTY WARNING FINGERS
AT BAD LITTLE BOYS AND PATTING GOOD ONES LOVINGLY
THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN
TEACHERS SHOWED OFF WITH SMALL SCOLDINGS AND OTHER LITTLE DISPLAYS OF
AUTHORITY AND FINE ATTENTION TO DISCIPLINE AND MOST OF THE TEACHERS OF
BOTH SEXES FOUND BUSINESS UP AT THE LIBRARY BY THE PULPIT AND IT WAS
BUSINESS THAT FREQUENTLY HAD TO BE DONE OVER AGAIN TWO OR THREE TIMES
WITH MUCH SEEMING VEXATION
THE LITTLE GIRLS SHOWED OFF IN VARIOUS
WAYS AND THE LITTLE BOYS SHOWED OFF WITH SUCH DILIGENCE THAT THE AIR
WAS THICK WITH PAPER WADS AND THE MURMUR OF SCUFFLINGS
AND ABOVE IT
ALL THE GREAT MAN SAT AND BEAMED A MAJESTIC JUDICIAL SMILE UPON ALL
THE HOUSE AND WARMED HIMSELF IN THE SUN OF HIS OWN GRANDEUR FOR HE WAS
SHOWING OFF TOO
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING WANTING TO MAKE MR
WALTERS' ECSTASY COMPLETE
AND THAT WAS A CHANCE TO DELIVER A BIBLE PRIZE AND EXHIBIT A PRODIGY
SEVERAL PUPILS HAD A FEW YELLOW TICKETS BUT NONE HAD ENOUGH HE HAD BEEN
AROUND AMONG THE STAR PUPILS INQUIRING
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WORLDS NOW
TO HAVE THAT GERMAN LAD BACK AGAIN WITH A SOUND MIND
AND NOW AT THIS MOMENT WHEN HOPE WAS DEAD TOM SAWYER CAME FORWARD WITH
NINE YELLOW TICKETS NINE RED TICKETS AND TEN BLUE ONES AND DEMANDED
A BIBLE
THIS WAS A THUNDERBOLT OUT OF A CLEAR SKY
WALTERS WAS NOT
EXPECTING AN APPLICATION FROM THIS SOURCE FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS
BUT
THERE WAS NO GETTING AROUND IT HERE WERE THE CERTIFIED CHECKS AND THEY
WERE GOOD FOR THEIR FACE
TOM WAS THEREFORE ELEVATED TO A PLACE WITH
THE JUDGE AND THE OTHER ELECT AND THE GREAT NEWS WAS ANNOUNCED FROM
HEADQUARTERS
IT WAS THE MOST STUNNING SURPRISE OF THE DECADE AND
SO PROFOUND WAS THE SENSATION THAT IT LIFTED THE NEW HERO UP TO THE
JUDICIAL ONE'S ALTITUDE AND THE SCHOOL HAD TWO MARVELS TO GAZE UPON
IN PLACE OF ONE
THE BOYS WERE ALL EATEN UP WITH ENVY BUT THOSE THAT
SUFFERED THE BITTEREST PANGS WERE THOSE WHO PERCEIVED TOO LATE THAT THEY
THEMSELVES HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THIS HATED SPLENDOR BY TRADING TICKETS TO
TOM FOR THE WEALTH HE HAD AMASSED IN SELLING WHITEWASHING PRIVILEGES
THESE DESPISED THEMSELVES AS BEING THE DUPES OF A WILY FRAUD A
GUILEFUL SNAKE IN THE GRASS
THE PRIZE WAS DELIVERED TO TOM WITH AS MUCH EFFUSION AS THE
SUPERINTENDENT COULD PUMP UP UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT LACKED
SOMEWHAT OF THE TRUE GUSH FOR THE POOR FELLOW'S INSTINCT TAUGHT HIM
THAT THERE WAS A MYSTERY HERE THAT COULD NOT WELL BEAR THE LIGHT
PERHAPS IT WAS SIMPLY PREPOSTEROUS THAT THIS BOY HAD WAREHOUSED TWO
THOUSAND SHEAVES OF SCRIPTURAL WISDOM ON HIS PREMISES A DOZEN WOULD
STRAIN HIS CAPACITY WITHOUT A DOUBT
AMY LAWRENCE WAS PROUD AND GLAD AND SHE TRIED TO MAKE TOM SEE IT IN
HER FACE BUT HE WOULDN'T LOOK
SHE WONDERED THEN SHE WAS JUST A GRAIN
TROUBLED NEXT A DIM SUSPICION CAME AND WENT CAME AGAIN SHE WATCHED
A FURTIVE GLANCE TOLD HER WORLDS AND THEN HER HEART BROKE AND SHE WAS
JEALOUS AND ANGRY AND THE TEARS CAME AND SHE HATED EVERYBODY
TOM MOST
OF ALL SHE THOUGHT
TOM WAS INTRODUCED TO THE JUDGE BUT HIS TONGUE WAS TIED HIS BREATH
WOULD HARDLY COME HIS HEART QUAKED PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE AWFUL
GREATNESS OF THE MAN BUT MAINLY BECAUSE HE WAS HER PARENT
HE WOULD
HAVE LIKED TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIP HIM IF IT WERE IN THE DARK
THE
JUDGE PUT HIS HAND ON TOM'S HEAD AND CALLED HIM A FINE LITTLE MAN AND
ASKED HIM WHAT HIS NAME WAS
THE BOY STAMMERED GASPED AND GOT IT OUT
TOM
OH NO NOT TOM IT IS
THOMAS
AH THAT'S IT
I THOUGHT THERE WAS MORE TO IT MAYBE
THAT'S VERY WELL
BUT YOU'VE ANOTHER ONE I DARESAY AND YOU'LL TELL IT TO ME WON'T YOU
TELL THE GENTLEMAN YOUR OTHER NAME THOMAS SAID WALTERS AND SAY
SIR
YOU MUSTN'T FORGET YOUR MANNERS
THOMAS SAWYER SIR
THAT'S IT THAT'S A GOOD BOY
FINE BOY
FINE MANLY LITTLE FELLOW
TWO
THOUSAND VERSES IS A GREAT MANY VERY VERY GREAT MANY
AND YOU NEVER CAN
BE SORRY FOR THE TROUBLE YOU TOOK TO LEARN THEM FOR KNOWLEDGE IS WORTH
MORE THAN ANYTHING THERE IS IN THE WORLD IT'S WHAT MAKES GREAT MEN
AND GOOD MEN YOU'LL BE A GREAT MAN AND A GOOD MAN YOURSELF SOME
DAY THOMAS AND THEN YOU'LL LOOK BACK AND SAY IT'S ALL OWING TO THE
PRECIOUS SUNDAY SCHOOL PRIVILEGES OF MY BOYHOOD IT'S ALL OWING TO
MY DEAR TEACHERS THAT TAUGHT ME TO LEARN IT'S ALL OWING TO THE GOOD
SUPERINTENDENT WHO ENCOURAGED ME AND WATCHED OVER ME AND GAVE ME A
BEAUTIFUL BIBLE A SPLENDID ELEGANT BIBLE TO KEEP AND HAVE IT ALL FOR MY
OWN ALWAYS IT'S ALL OWING TO RIGHT BRINGING UP THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL
SAY THOMAS AND YOU WOULDN'T TAKE ANY MONEY FOR THOSE TWO THOUSAND
VERSES NO INDEED YOU WOULDN'T
AND NOW YOU WOULDN'T MIND TELLING ME AND
THIS LADY SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'VE LEARNED NO I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T FOR
WE ARE PROUD OF LITTLE BOYS THAT LEARN
NOW NO DOUBT YOU KNOW THE NAMES
OF ALL THE TWELVE DISCIPLES
WON'T YOU TELL US THE NAMES OF THE FIRST
TWO THAT WERE APPOINTED
TOM WAS TUGGING AT A BUTTON HOLE AND LOOKING SHEEPISH
HE BLUSHED
NOW AND HIS EYES FELL
MR
WALTERS' HEART SANK WITHIN HIM
HE SAID
TO HIMSELF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THAT THE BOY CAN ANSWER THE SIMPLEST
QUESTION WHY DID THE JUDGE ASK HIM YET HE FELT OBLIGED TO SPEAK UP
AND SAY
ANSWER THE GENTLEMAN THOMAS DON'T BE AFRAID
TOM STILL HUNG FIRE
NOW I KNOW YOU'LL TELL ME SAID THE LADY
THE NAMES OF THE FIRST TWO
DISCIPLES WERE
DAVID AND GOLIAH
LET US DRAW THE CURTAIN OF CHARITY OVER THE REST OF THE SCENE
CHAPTER V
ABOUT HALF PAST TEN THE CRACKED BELL OF THE SMALL CHURCH BEGAN TO RING
AND PRESENTLY THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GATHER FOR THE MORNING SERMON
THE
SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN DISTRIBUTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE HOUSE AND
OCCUPIED PEWS WITH THEIR PARENTS SO AS TO BE UNDER SUPERVISION
AUNT
POLLY CAME AND TOM AND SID AND MARY SAT WITH HER TOM BEING PLACED NEXT
THE AISLE IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE AS FAR AWAY FROM THE OPEN WINDOW
AND THE SEDUCTIVE OUTSIDE SUMMER SCENES AS POSSIBLE
THE CROWD FILED UP
THE AISLES THE AGED AND NEEDY POSTMASTER WHO HAD SEEN BETTER DAYS
THE MAYOR AND HIS WIFE FOR THEY HAD A MAYOR THERE AMONG OTHER
UNNECESSARIES THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE THE WIDOW DOUGLASS FAIR
SMART AND FORTY A GENEROUS GOOD HEARTED SOUL AND WELL TO DO HER HILL
MANSION THE ONLY PALACE IN THE TOWN AND THE MOST HOSPITABLE AND MUCH
THE MOST LAVISH IN THE MATTER OF FESTIVITIES THAT ST
PETERSBURG COULD
BOAST THE BENT AND VENERABLE MAJOR AND MRS
WARD LAWYER RIVERSON THE
NEW NOTABLE FROM A DISTANCE NEXT THE BELLE OF THE VILLAGE FOLLOWED BY
A TROOP OF LAWN CLAD AND RIBBON DECKED YOUNG HEART BREAKERS THEN ALL
THE YOUNG CLERKS IN TOWN IN A BODY FOR THEY HAD STOOD IN THE VESTIBULE
SUCKING THEIR CANE HEADS A CIRCLING WALL OF OILED AND SIMPERING
ADMIRERS TILL THE LAST GIRL HAD RUN THEIR GANTLET AND LAST OF ALL CAME
THE MODEL BOY WILLIE MUFFERSON TAKING AS HEEDFUL CARE OF HIS MOTHER AS
IF SHE WERE CUT GLASS
HE ALWAYS BROUGHT HIS MOTHER TO CHURCH AND WAS
THE PRIDE OF ALL THE MATRONS
THE BOYS ALL HATED HIM HE WAS SO
GOOD
AND BESIDES HE HAD BEEN THROWN UP TO THEM SO MUCH
HIS
WHITE HANDKERCHIEF WAS HANGING OUT OF HIS POCKET BEHIND AS USUAL ON
SUNDAYS ACCIDENTALLY
TOM HAD NO HANDKERCHIEF AND HE LOOKED UPON BOYS
WHO HAD AS SNOBS
THE CONGREGATION BEING FULLY ASSEMBLED NOW THE BELL RANG ONCE MORE
TO WARN LAGGARDS AND STRAGGLERS AND THEN A SOLEMN HUSH FELL UPON THE
CHURCH WHICH WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE TITTERING AND WHISPERING OF THE
CHOIR IN THE GALLERY
THE CHOIR ALWAYS TITTERED AND WHISPERED ALL
THROUGH SERVICE
THERE WAS ONCE A CHURCH CHOIR THAT WAS NOT ILL BRED
BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHERE IT WAS NOW
IT WAS A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO
AND I CAN SCARCELY REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT I THINK IT WAS IN
SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY
THE MINISTER GAVE OUT THE HYMN AND READ IT THROUGH WITH A RELISH IN A
PECULIAR STYLE WHICH WAS MUCH ADMIRED IN THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY
HIS
VOICE BEGAN ON A MEDIUM KEY AND CLIMBED STEADILY UP TILL IT REACHED A
CERTAIN POINT WHERE IT BORE WITH STRONG EMPHASIS UPON THE TOPMOST WORD
AND THEN PLUNGED DOWN AS IF FROM A SPRING BOARD
SHALL I BE CAR RI ED TOE THE SKIES ON FLOW'RY BEDS OF EASE
WHILST OTHERS FIGHT TO WIN THE PRIZE AND SAIL THRO' BLOOD Y SEAS
HE WAS REGARDED AS A WONDERFUL READER
AT CHURCH SOCIABLES HE WAS
ALWAYS CALLED UPON TO READ POETRY AND WHEN HE WAS THROUGH THE LADIES
WOULD LIFT UP THEIR HANDS AND LET THEM FALL HELPLESSLY IN THEIR LAPS
AND WALL THEIR EYES AND SHAKE THEIR HEADS AS MUCH AS TO SAY WORDS
CANNOT EXPRESS IT IT IS TOO BEAUTIFUL TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR THIS MORTAL
EARTH
AFTER THE HYMN HAD BEEN SUNG THE REV
MR
SPRAGUE TURNED HIMSELF INTO
A BULLETIN BOARD AND READ OFF NOTICES OF MEETINGS AND SOCIETIES AND
THINGS TILL IT SEEMED THAT THE LIST WOULD STRETCH OUT TO THE CRACK OF
DOOM A QUEER CUSTOM WHICH IS STILL KEPT UP IN AMERICA EVEN IN CITIES
AWAY HERE IN THIS AGE OF ABUNDANT NEWSPAPERS
OFTEN THE LESS THERE IS
TO JUSTIFY A TRADITIONAL CUSTOM THE HARDER IT IS TO GET RID OF IT
AND NOW THE MINISTER PRAYED
A GOOD GENEROUS PRAYER IT WAS AND WENT
INTO DETAILS IT PLEADED FOR THE CHURCH AND THE LITTLE CHILDREN OF THE
CHURCH FOR THE OTHER CHURCHES OF THE VILLAGE FOR THE VILLAGE ITSELF
FOR THE COUNTY FOR THE STATE FOR THE STATE OFFICERS FOR THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE CHURCHES OF THE UNITED STATES FOR CONGRESS FOR THE
PRESIDENT FOR THE OFFICERS OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR POOR SAILORS TOSSED
BY STORMY SEAS FOR THE OPPRESSED MILLIONS GROANING UNDER THE HEEL OF
EUROPEAN MONARCHIES AND ORIENTAL DESPOTISMS FOR SUCH AS HAVE THE LIGHT
AND THE GOOD TIDINGS AND YET HAVE NOT EYES TO SEE NOR EARS TO HEAR
WITHAL FOR THE HEATHEN IN THE FAR ISLANDS OF THE SEA AND CLOSED WITH
A SUPPLICATION THAT THE WORDS HE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK MIGHT FIND GRACE
AND FAVOR AND BE AS SEED SOWN IN FERTILE GROUND YIELDING IN TIME A
GRATEFUL HARVEST OF GOOD
AMEN
THERE WAS A RUSTLING OF DRESSES AND THE STANDING CONGREGATION SAT DOWN
THE BOY WHOSE HISTORY THIS BOOK RELATES DID NOT ENJOY THE PRAYER HE
ONLY ENDURED IT IF HE EVEN DID THAT MUCH
HE WAS RESTIVE ALL THROUGH IT
HE KEPT TALLY OF THE DETAILS OF THE PRAYER UNCONSCIOUSLY FOR HE WAS NOT
LISTENING BUT HE KNEW THE GROUND OF OLD AND THE CLERGYMAN'S REGULAR
ROUTE OVER IT AND WHEN A LITTLE TRIFLE OF NEW MATTER WAS INTERLARDED
HIS EAR DETECTED IT AND HIS WHOLE NATURE RESENTED IT HE CONSIDERED
ADDITIONS UNFAIR AND SCOUNDRELLY
IN THE MIDST OF THE PRAYER A FLY HAD
LIT ON THE BACK OF THE PEW IN FRONT OF HIM AND TORTURED HIS SPIRIT BY
CALMLY RUBBING ITS HANDS TOGETHER EMBRACING ITS HEAD WITH ITS ARMS AND
POLISHING IT SO VIGOROUSLY THAT IT SEEMED TO ALMOST PART COMPANY WITH
THE BODY AND THE SLENDER THREAD OF A NECK WAS EXPOSED TO VIEW SCRAPING
ITS WINGS WITH ITS HIND LEGS AND SMOOTHING THEM TO ITS BODY AS IF THEY
HAD BEEN COAT TAILS GOING THROUGH ITS WHOLE TOILET AS TRANQUILLY AS IF
IT KNEW IT WAS PERFECTLY SAFE
AS INDEED IT WAS FOR AS SORELY AS TOM'S
HANDS ITCHED TO GRAB FOR IT THEY DID NOT DARE HE BELIEVED HIS SOUL WOULD
BE INSTANTLY DESTROYED IF HE DID SUCH A THING WHILE THE PRAYER WAS GOING
ON
BUT WITH THE CLOSING SENTENCE HIS HAND BEGAN TO CURVE AND STEAL
FORWARD AND THE INSTANT THE AMEN WAS OUT THE FLY WAS A PRISONER OF
WAR
HIS AUNT DETECTED THE ACT AND MADE HIM LET IT GO
THE MINISTER GAVE OUT HIS TEXT AND DRONED ALONG MONOTONOUSLY THROUGH AN
ARGUMENT THAT WAS SO PROSY THAT MANY A HEAD BY AND BY BEGAN TO NOD AND
YET IT WAS AN ARGUMENT THAT DEALT IN LIMITLESS FIRE AND BRIMSTONE AND
THINNED THE PREDESTINED ELECT DOWN TO A COMPANY SO SMALL AS TO BE HARDLY
WORTH THE SAVING
TOM COUNTED THE PAGES OF THE SERMON AFTER CHURCH HE
ALWAYS KNEW HOW MANY PAGES THERE HAD BEEN BUT HE SELDOM KNEW ANYTHING
ELSE ABOUT THE DISCOURSE
HOWEVER THIS TIME HE WAS REALLY INTERESTED
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
THE MINISTER MADE A GRAND AND MOVING PICTURE OF THE
ASSEMBLING TOGETHER OF THE WORLD'S HOSTS AT THE MILLENNIUM WHEN THE LION
AND THE LAMB SHOULD LIE DOWN TOGETHER AND A LITTLE CHILD SHOULD LEAD
THEM
BUT THE PATHOS THE LESSON THE MORAL OF THE GREAT SPECTACLE
WERE LOST UPON THE BOY HE ONLY THOUGHT OF THE CONSPICUOUSNESS OF THE
PRINCIPAL CHARACTER BEFORE THE ON LOOKING NATIONS HIS FACE LIT WITH THE
THOUGHT AND HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT HE WISHED HE COULD BE THAT CHILD
IF IT WAS A TAME LION
NOW HE LAPSED INTO SUFFERING AGAIN AS THE DRY ARGUMENT WAS RESUMED
PRESENTLY HE BETHOUGHT HIM OF A TREASURE HE HAD AND GOT IT OUT
IT WAS
A LARGE BLACK BEETLE WITH FORMIDABLE JAWS A PINCHBUG HE CALLED IT
IT
WAS IN A PERCUSSION CAP BOX
THE FIRST THING THE BEETLE DID WAS TO
TAKE HIM BY THE FINGER
A NATURAL FILLIP FOLLOWED THE BEETLE WENT
FLOUNDERING INTO THE AISLE AND LIT ON ITS BACK AND THE HURT FINGER WENT
INTO THE BOY'S MOUTH
THE BEETLE LAY THERE WORKING ITS HELPLESS LEGS
UNABLE TO TURN OVER
TOM EYED IT AND LONGED FOR IT BUT IT WAS SAFE OUT
OF HIS REACH
OTHER PEOPLE UNINTERESTED IN THE SERMON FOUND RELIEF IN
THE BEETLE AND THEY EYED IT TOO
PRESENTLY A VAGRANT POODLE DOG CAME
IDLING ALONG SAD AT HEART LAZY WITH THE SUMMER SOFTNESS AND THE
QUIET WEARY OF CAPTIVITY SIGHING FOR CHANGE
HE SPIED THE BEETLE THE
DROOPING TAIL LIFTED AND WAGGED
HE SURVEYED THE PRIZE WALKED AROUND
IT SMELT AT IT FROM A SAFE DISTANCE WALKED AROUND IT AGAIN GREW
BOLDER AND TOOK A CLOSER SMELL THEN LIFTED HIS LIP AND MADE A GINGERLY
SNATCH AT IT JUST MISSING IT MADE ANOTHER AND ANOTHER BEGAN TO ENJOY
THE DIVERSION SUBSIDED TO HIS STOMACH WITH THE BEETLE BETWEEN HIS PAWS
AND CONTINUED HIS EXPERIMENTS GREW WEARY AT LAST AND THEN INDIFFERENT
AND ABSENT MINDED
HIS HEAD NODDED AND LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS CHIN
DESCENDED AND TOUCHED THE ENEMY WHO SEIZED IT
THERE WAS A SHARP YELP
A FLIRT OF THE POODLE'S HEAD AND THE BEETLE FELL A COUPLE OF YARDS
AWAY AND LIT ON ITS BACK ONCE MORE
THE NEIGHBORING SPECTATORS
SHOOK WITH A GENTLE INWARD JOY SEVERAL FACES WENT BEHIND FANS AND
HAND KERCHIEFS AND TOM WAS ENTIRELY HAPPY
THE DOG LOOKED FOOLISH
AND PROBABLY FELT SO BUT THERE WAS RESENTMENT IN HIS HEART TOO AND A
CRAVING FOR REVENGE
SO HE WENT TO THE BEETLE AND BEGAN A WARY ATTACK ON
IT AGAIN JUMPING AT IT FROM EVERY POINT OF A CIRCLE LIGHTING WITH HIS
FORE PAWS WITHIN AN INCH OF THE CREATURE MAKING EVEN CLOSER SNATCHES AT
IT WITH HIS TEETH AND JERKING HIS HEAD TILL HIS EARS FLAPPED AGAIN
BUT
HE GREW TIRED ONCE MORE AFTER A WHILE TRIED TO AMUSE HIMSELF WITH A
FLY BUT FOUND NO RELIEF FOLLOWED AN ANT AROUND WITH HIS NOSE CLOSE
TO THE FLOOR AND QUICKLY WEARIED OF THAT YAWNED SIGHED FORGOT THE
BEETLE ENTIRELY AND SAT DOWN ON IT
THEN THERE WAS A WILD YELP OF AGONY
AND THE POODLE WENT SAILING UP THE AISLE THE YELPS CONTINUED AND SO
DID THE DOG HE CROSSED THE HOUSE IN FRONT OF THE ALTAR HE FLEW
DOWN THE OTHER AISLE HE CROSSED BEFORE THE DOORS HE CLAMORED UP THE
HOME STRETCH HIS ANGUISH GREW WITH HIS PROGRESS TILL PRESENTLY HE WAS
BUT A WOOLLY COMET MOVING IN ITS ORBIT WITH THE GLEAM AND THE SPEED OF
LIGHT
AT LAST THE FRANTIC SUFFERER SHEERED FROM ITS COURSE AND SPRANG
INTO ITS MASTER'S LAP HE FLUNG IT OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THE VOICE OF
DISTRESS QUICKLY THINNED AWAY AND DIED IN THE DISTANCE
BY THIS TIME THE WHOLE CHURCH WAS RED FACED AND SUFFOCATING WITH
SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER AND THE SERMON HAD COME TO A DEAD STANDSTILL
THE DISCOURSE WAS RESUMED PRESENTLY BUT IT WENT LAME AND HALTING ALL
POSSIBILITY OF IMPRESSIVENESS BEING AT AN END FOR EVEN THE GRAVEST
SENTIMENTS WERE CONSTANTLY BEING RECEIVED WITH A SMOTHERED BURST OF
UNHOLY MIRTH UNDER COVER OF SOME REMOTE PEW BACK AS IF THE POOR PARSON
HAD SAID A RARELY FACETIOUS THING
IT WAS A GENUINE RELIEF TO THE WHOLE
CONGREGATION WHEN THE ORDEAL WAS OVER AND THE BENEDICTION PRONOUNCED
TOM SAWYER WENT HOME QUITE CHEERFUL THINKING TO HIMSELF THAT THERE WAS
SOME SATISFACTION ABOUT DIVINE SERVICE WHEN THERE WAS A BIT OF VARIETY
IN IT
HE HAD BUT ONE MARRING THOUGHT HE WAS WILLING THAT THE DOG
SHOULD PLAY WITH HIS PINCHBUG BUT HE DID NOT THINK IT WAS UPRIGHT IN
HIM TO CARRY IT OFF
CHAPTER VI
MONDAY MORNING FOUND TOM SAWYER MISERABLE
MONDAY MORNING ALWAYS FOUND
HIM SO BECAUSE IT BEGAN ANOTHER WEEK'S SLOW SUFFERING IN SCHOOL
HE
GENERALLY BEGAN THAT DAY WITH WISHING HE HAD HAD NO INTERVENING HOLIDAY
IT MADE THE GOING INTO CAPTIVITY AND FETTERS AGAIN SO MUCH MORE ODIOUS
TOM LAY THINKING
PRESENTLY IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WISHED HE WAS
SICK THEN HE COULD STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL
HERE WAS A VAGUE POSSIBILITY
HE CANVASSED HIS SYSTEM
NO AILMENT WAS FOUND AND HE INVESTIGATED
AGAIN
THIS TIME HE THOUGHT HE COULD DETECT COLICKY SYMPTOMS AND HE
BEGAN TO ENCOURAGE THEM WITH CONSIDERABLE HOPE
BUT THEY SOON GREW
FEEBLE AND PRESENTLY DIED WHOLLY AWAY
HE REFLECTED FURTHER
SUDDENLY
HE DISCOVERED SOMETHING
ONE OF HIS UPPER FRONT TEETH WAS LOOSE
THIS
WAS LUCKY HE WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN TO GROAN AS A STARTER AS HE
CALLED IT WHEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF HE CAME INTO COURT WITH THAT
ARGUMENT HIS AUNT WOULD PULL IT OUT AND THAT WOULD HURT
SO HE THOUGHT
HE WOULD HOLD THE TOOTH IN RESERVE FOR THE PRESENT AND SEEK FURTHER
NOTHING OFFERED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AND THEN HE REMEMBERED HEARING
THE DOCTOR TELL ABOUT A CERTAIN THING THAT LAID UP A PATIENT FOR TWO OR
THREE WEEKS AND THREATENED TO MAKE HIM LOSE A FINGER
SO THE BOY EAGERLY
DREW HIS SORE TOE FROM UNDER THE SHEET AND HELD IT UP FOR INSPECTION
BUT NOW HE DID NOT KNOW THE NECESSARY SYMPTOMS
HOWEVER IT SEEMED
WELL WORTH WHILE TO CHANCE IT SO HE FELL TO GROANING WITH CONSIDERABLE
SPIRIT
BUT SID SLEPT ON UNCONSCIOUS
TOM GROANED LOUDER AND FANCIED THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL PAIN IN THE TOE
NO RESULT FROM SID
TOM WAS PANTING WITH HIS EXERTIONS BY THIS TIME
HE TOOK A REST AND THEN
SWELLED HIMSELF UP AND FETCHED A SUCCESSION OF ADMIRABLE GROANS
SID SNORED ON
TOM WAS AGGRAVATED
HE SAID SID SID AND SHOOK HIM
THIS COURSE
WORKED WELL AND TOM BEGAN TO GROAN AGAIN
SID YAWNED STRETCHED THEN
BROUGHT HIMSELF UP ON HIS ELBOW WITH A SNORT AND BEGAN TO STARE AT TOM
TOM WENT ON GROANING
SID SAID
TOM SAY TOM NO RESPONSE HERE TOM TOM WHAT IS THE MATTER
TOM AND HE SHOOK HIM AND LOOKED IN HIS FACE ANXIOUSLY
TOM MOANED OUT
OH DON'T SID
DON'T JOGGLE ME
WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER TOM I MUST CALL AUNTIE
NO NEVER MIND
IT'LL BE OVER BY AND BY MAYBE
DON'T CALL ANYBODY
BUT I MUST DON'T GROAN SO TOM IT'S AWFUL
HOW LONG YOU BEEN THIS
WAY
HOURS
OUCH OH DON'T STIR SO SID YOU'LL KILL ME
TOM WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME SOONER OH TOM DON'T IT MAKES MY FLESH
CRAWL TO HEAR YOU
TOM WHAT IS THE MATTER
I FORGIVE YOU EVERYTHING SID
GROAN EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER DONE TO
ME
WHEN I'M GONE
OH TOM YOU AIN'T DYING ARE YOU DON'T TOM OH DON'T
MAYBE
I FORGIVE EVERYBODY SID
GROAN TELL 'EM SO SID
AND SID YOU GIVE
MY WINDOW SASH AND MY CAT WITH ONE EYE TO THAT NEW GIRL THAT'S COME TO
TOWN AND TELL HER
BUT SID HAD SNATCHED HIS CLOTHES AND GONE
TOM WAS SUFFERING IN REALITY
NOW SO HANDSOMELY WAS HIS IMAGINATION WORKING AND SO HIS GROANS HAD
GATHERED QUITE A GENUINE TONE
SID FLEW DOWNSTAIRS AND SAID
OH AUNT POLLY COME TOM'S DYING
DYING
YES'M
DON'T WAIT COME QUICK
RUBBAGE I DON'T BELIEVE IT
BUT SHE FLED UPSTAIRS NEVERTHELESS WITH SID AND MARY AT HER HEELS
AND HER FACE GREW WHITE TOO AND HER LIP TREMBLED
WHEN SHE REACHED THE
BEDSIDE SHE GASPED OUT
YOU TOM TOM WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
OH AUNTIE I'M
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU CHILD
OH AUNTIE MY SORE TOE'S MORTIFIED
THE OLD LADY SANK DOWN INTO A CHAIR AND LAUGHED A LITTLE THEN CRIED A
LITTLE THEN DID BOTH TOGETHER
THIS RESTORED HER AND SHE SAID
TOM WHAT A TURN YOU DID GIVE ME
NOW YOU SHUT UP THAT NONSENSE AND
CLIMB OUT OF THIS
THE GROANS CEASED AND THE PAIN VANISHED FROM THE TOE
THE BOY FELT A
LITTLE FOOLISH AND HE SAID
AUNT POLLY IT SEEMED MORTIFIED AND IT HURT SO I NEVER MINDED MY
TOOTH AT ALL
YOUR TOOTH INDEED WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR TOOTH
ONE OF THEM'S LOOSE AND IT ACHES PERFECTLY AWFUL
THERE THERE NOW DON'T BEGIN THAT GROANING AGAIN
OPEN YOUR MOUTH
WELL YOUR TOOTH IS LOOSE BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE ABOUT THAT
MARY GET ME A SILK THREAD AND A CHUNK OF FIRE OUT OF THE KITCHEN
TOM SAID
OH PLEASE AUNTIE DON'T PULL IT OUT
IT DON'T HURT ANY MORE
I WISH
I MAY NEVER STIR IF IT DOES
PLEASE DON'T AUNTIE
I DON'T WANT TO STAY
HOME FROM SCHOOL
OH YOU DON'T DON'T YOU SO ALL THIS ROW WAS BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU'D
GET TO STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL AND GO A FISHING TOM TOM I LOVE YOU SO
AND YOU SEEM TO TRY EVERY WAY YOU CAN TO BREAK MY OLD HEART WITH YOUR
OUTRAGEOUSNESS BY THIS TIME THE DENTAL INSTRUMENTS WERE READY
THE OLD
LADY MADE ONE END OF THE SILK THREAD FAST TO TOM'S TOOTH WITH A LOOP
AND TIED THE OTHER TO THE BEDPOST
THEN SHE SEIZED THE CHUNK OF FIRE AND
SUDDENLY THRUST IT ALMOST INTO THE BOY'S FACE
THE TOOTH HUNG DANGLING
BY THE BEDPOST NOW
BUT ALL TRIALS BRING THEIR COMPENSATIONS
AS TOM WENDED TO SCHOOL AFTER
BREAKFAST HE WAS THE ENVY OF EVERY BOY HE MET BECAUSE THE GAP IN HIS
UPPER ROW OF TEETH ENABLED HIM TO EXPECTORATE IN A NEW AND ADMIRABLE
WAY
HE GATHERED QUITE A FOLLOWING OF LADS INTERESTED IN THE EXHIBITION
AND ONE THAT HAD CUT HIS FINGER AND HAD BEEN A CENTRE OF FASCINATION AND
HOMAGE UP TO THIS TIME NOW FOUND HIMSELF SUDDENLY WITHOUT AN ADHERENT
AND SHORN OF HIS GLORY
HIS HEART WAS HEAVY AND HE SAID WITH A DISDAIN
WHICH HE DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WASN'T ANYTHING TO SPIT LIKE TOM SAWYER
BUT ANOTHER BOY SAID SOUR GRAPES AND HE WANDERED AWAY A DISMANTLED
HERO
SHORTLY TOM CAME UPON THE JUVENILE PARIAH OF THE VILLAGE HUCKLEBERRY
FINN SON OF THE TOWN DRUNKARD
HUCKLEBERRY WAS CORDIALLY HATED AND
DREADED BY ALL THE MOTHERS OF THE TOWN BECAUSE HE WAS IDLE AND LAWLESS
AND VULGAR AND BAD AND BECAUSE ALL THEIR CHILDREN ADMIRED HIM SO AND
DELIGHTED IN HIS FORBIDDEN SOCIETY AND WISHED THEY DARED TO BE LIKE
HIM
TOM WAS LIKE THE REST OF THE RESPECTABLE BOYS IN THAT HE ENVIED
HUCKLEBERRY HIS GAUDY OUTCAST CONDITION AND WAS UNDER STRICT ORDERS
NOT TO PLAY WITH HIM
SO HE PLAYED WITH HIM EVERY TIME HE GOT A CHANCE
HUCKLEBERRY WAS ALWAYS DRESSED IN THE CAST OFF CLOTHES OF FULL GROWN
MEN AND THEY WERE IN PERENNIAL BLOOM AND FLUTTERING WITH RAGS
HIS HAT
WAS A VAST RUIN WITH A WIDE CRESCENT LOPPED OUT OF ITS BRIM HIS COAT
WHEN HE WORE ONE HUNG NEARLY TO HIS HEELS AND HAD THE REARWARD BUTTONS
FAR DOWN THE BACK BUT ONE SUSPENDER SUPPORTED HIS TROUSERS THE SEAT OF
THE TROUSERS BAGGED LOW AND CONTAINED NOTHING THE FRINGED LEGS DRAGGED
IN THE DIRT WHEN NOT ROLLED UP
HUCKLEBERRY CAME AND WENT AT HIS OWN FREE WILL
HE SLEPT ON DOORSTEPS
IN FINE WEATHER AND IN EMPTY HOGSHEADS IN WET HE DID NOT HAVE TO GO TO
SCHOOL OR TO CHURCH OR CALL ANY BEING MASTER OR OBEY ANYBODY HE COULD
GO FISHING OR SWIMMING WHEN AND WHERE HE CHOSE AND STAY AS LONG AS IT
SUITED HIM NOBODY FORBADE HIM TO FIGHT HE COULD SIT UP AS LATE AS HE
PLEASED HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST BOY THAT WENT BAREFOOT IN THE SPRING
AND THE LAST TO RESUME LEATHER IN THE FALL HE NEVER HAD TO WASH NOR
PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES HE COULD SWEAR WONDERFULLY
IN A WORD EVERYTHING
THAT GOES TO MAKE LIFE PRECIOUS THAT BOY HAD
SO THOUGHT EVERY HARASSED
HAMPERED RESPECTABLE BOY IN ST
PETERSBURG
TOM HAILED THE ROMANTIC OUTCAST
HELLO HUCKLEBERRY
HELLO YOURSELF AND SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT
WHAT'S THAT YOU GOT
DEAD CAT
LEMME SEE HIM HUCK
MY HE'S PRETTY STIFF
WHERE'D YOU GET HIM
BOUGHT HIM OFF'N A BOY

WHERE'D YOU GET THE BLUE TICKET
BOUGHT IT OFF'N BEN ROGERS TWO WEEKS AGO FOR A HOOP STICK
SAY WHAT IS DEAD CATS GOOD FOR HUCK

NIGGER TOLD ME

BUT I NEVER SEE A NIGGER THAT WOULDN'T LIE
SHUCKS
NOW YOU TELL ME HOW BOB TANNER DONE IT HUCK
WHY HE TOOK AND DIPPED HIS HAND IN A ROTTEN STUMP WHERE THE RAIN WATER
WAS
IN THE DAYTIME
CERTAINLY
WITH HIS FACE TO THE STUMP
YES

DID HE SAY ANYTHING
I DON'T RECKON HE DID
I DON'T KNOW
AHA TALK ABOUT TRYING TO CURE WARTS WITH SPUNK WATER SUCH A BLAME FOOL
WAY AS THAT WHY THAT AIN'T A GOING TO DO ANY GOOD
YOU GOT TO GO ALL
BY YOURSELF TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS WHERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A
SPUNK WATER STUMP AND JUST AS IT'S MIDNIGHT YOU BACK UP AGAINST THE STUMP
AND JAM YOUR HAND IN AND SAY
'BARLEY CORN BARLEY CORN INJUN MEAL SHORTS SPUNK WATER SPUNK WATER
SWALLER THESE WARTS
AND THEN WALK AWAY QUICK ELEVEN STEPS WITH YOUR EYES SHUT AND THEN
TURN AROUND THREE TIMES AND WALK HOME WITHOUT SPEAKING TO ANYBODY
BECAUSE IF YOU SPEAK THE CHARM'S BUSTED
WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD WAY BUT THAT AIN'T THE WAY BOB TANNER
DONE
NO SIR YOU CAN BET HE DIDN'T BECUZ HE'S THE WARTIEST BOY IN THIS
TOWN AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE A WART ON HIM IF HE'D KNOWED HOW TO WORK
SPUNK WATER
I'VE TOOK OFF THOUSANDS OF WARTS OFF OF MY HANDS THAT WAY
HUCK
I PLAY WITH FROGS SO MUCH THAT I'VE ALWAYS GOT CONSIDERABLE MANY
WARTS
SOMETIMES I TAKE 'EM OFF WITH A BEAN
YES BEAN'S GOOD
I'VE DONE THAT
HAVE YOU WHAT'S YOUR WAY
YOU TAKE AND SPLIT THE BEAN AND CUT THE WART SO AS TO GET SOME BLOOD
AND THEN YOU PUT THE BLOOD ON ONE PIECE OF THE BEAN AND TAKE AND DIG
A HOLE AND BURY IT 'BOUT MIDNIGHT AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE DARK OF THE
MOON AND THEN YOU BURN UP THE REST OF THE BEAN
YOU SEE THAT PIECE
THAT'S GOT THE BLOOD ON IT WILL KEEP DRAWING AND DRAWING TRYING TO
FETCH THE OTHER PIECE TO IT AND SO THAT HELPS THE BLOOD TO DRAW THE
WART AND PRETTY SOON OFF SHE COMES
YES THAT'S IT HUCK THAT'S IT THOUGH WHEN YOU'RE BURYING IT IF YOU
SAY 'DOWN BEAN OFF WART COME NO MORE TO BOTHER ME IT'S BETTER
THAT'S THE WAY JOE HARPER DOES AND HE'S BEEN NEARLY TO COONVILLE AND
MOST EVERYWHERES
BUT SAY HOW DO YOU CURE 'EM WITH DEAD CATS
WHY YOU TAKE YOUR CAT AND GO AND GET IN THE GRAVE YARD 'LONG ABOUT
MIDNIGHT WHEN SOMEBODY THAT WAS WICKED HAS BEEN BURIED AND WHEN IT'S
MIDNIGHT A DEVIL WILL COME OR MAYBE TWO OR THREE BUT YOU CAN'T SEE
'EM YOU CAN ONLY HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THE WIND OR MAYBE HEAR 'EM TALK
AND WHEN THEY'RE TAKING THAT FELLER AWAY YOU HEAVE YOUR CAT AFTER 'EM
AND SAY 'DEVIL FOLLOW CORPSE CAT FOLLOW DEVIL WARTS FOLLOW CAT I'M
DONE WITH YE THAT'LL FETCH ANY WART
SOUNDS RIGHT

SAY HUCK I'LL GIVE YOU MY TOOTH FOR HIM
LESS SEE IT
TOM GOT OUT A BIT OF PAPER AND CAREFULLY UNROLLED IT
HUCKLEBERRY VIEWED
IT WISTFULLY
THE TEMPTATION WAS VERY STRONG
AT LAST HE SAID
IS IT GENUWYNE
TOM LIFTED HIS LIP AND SHOWED THE VACANCY
WELL ALL RIGHT SAID HUCKLEBERRY IT'S A TRADE
TOM ENCLOSED THE TICK IN THE PERCUSSION CAP BOX THAT HAD LATELY BEEN THE
PINCHBUG'S PRISON AND THE BOYS SEPARATED EACH FEELING WEALTHIER THAN
BEFORE
WHEN TOM REACHED THE LITTLE ISOLATED FRAME SCHOOL HOUSE HE STRODE IN
BRISKLY WITH THE MANNER OF ONE WHO HAD COME WITH ALL HONEST SPEED
HE
HUNG HIS HAT ON A PEG AND FLUNG HIMSELF INTO HIS SEAT WITH BUSINESS LIKE
ALACRITY
THE MASTER THRONED ON HIGH IN HIS GREAT SPLINT BOTTOM
ARM CHAIR WAS DOZING LULLED BY THE DROWSY HUM OF STUDY
THE
INTERRUPTION ROUSED HIM
THOMAS SAWYER
TOM KNEW THAT WHEN HIS NAME WAS PRONOUNCED IN FULL IT MEANT TROUBLE
SIR
COME UP HERE
NOW SIR WHY ARE YOU LATE AGAIN AS USUAL
TOM WAS ABOUT TO TAKE REFUGE IN A LIE WHEN HE SAW TWO LONG TAILS OF
YELLOW HAIR HANGING DOWN A BACK THAT HE RECOGNIZED BY THE ELECTRIC
SYMPATHY OF LOVE AND BY THAT FORM WAS THE ONLY VACANT PLACE ON THE
GIRLS' SIDE OF THE SCHOOL HOUSE
HE INSTANTLY SAID
I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN
THE MASTER'S PULSE STOOD STILL AND HE STARED HELPLESSLY
THE BUZZ OF
STUDY CEASED
THE PUPILS WONDERED IF THIS FOOLHARDY BOY HAD LOST HIS
MIND
THE MASTER SAID
YOU YOU DID WHAT
STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN
THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE WORDS
THOMAS SAWYER THIS IS THE MOST ASTOUNDING CONFESSION I HAVE EVER
LISTENED TO
NO MERE FERULE WILL ANSWER FOR THIS OFFENCE
TAKE OFF YOUR
JACKET
THE MASTER'S ARM PERFORMED UNTIL IT WAS TIRED AND THE STOCK OF SWITCHES
NOTABLY DIMINISHED
THEN THE ORDER FOLLOWED
NOW SIR GO AND SIT WITH THE GIRLS AND LET THIS BE A WARNING TO YOU
THE TITTER THAT RIPPLED AROUND THE ROOM APPEARED TO ABASH THE BOY BUT
IN REALITY THAT RESULT WAS CAUSED RATHER MORE BY HIS WORSHIPFUL AWE
OF HIS UNKNOWN IDOL AND THE DREAD PLEASURE THAT LAY IN HIS HIGH GOOD
FORTUNE
HE SAT DOWN UPON THE END OF THE PINE BENCH AND THE GIRL HITCHED
HERSELF AWAY FROM HIM WITH A TOSS OF HER HEAD
NUDGES AND WINKS AND
WHISPERS TRAVERSED THE ROOM BUT TOM SAT STILL WITH HIS ARMS UPON THE
LONG LOW DESK BEFORE HIM AND SEEMED TO STUDY HIS BOOK
BY AND BY ATTENTION CEASED FROM HIM AND THE ACCUSTOMED SCHOOL MURMUR
ROSE UPON THE DULL AIR ONCE MORE
PRESENTLY THE BOY BEGAN TO STEAL
FURTIVE GLANCES AT THE GIRL
SHE OBSERVED IT MADE A MOUTH AT HIM
AND GAVE HIM THE BACK OF HER HEAD FOR THE SPACE OF A MINUTE
WHEN SHE
CAUTIOUSLY FACED AROUND AGAIN A PEACH LAY BEFORE HER
SHE THRUST IT
AWAY
TOM GENTLY PUT IT BACK
SHE THRUST IT AWAY AGAIN BUT WITH LESS
ANIMOSITY
TOM PATIENTLY RETURNED IT TO ITS PLACE
THEN SHE LET IT
REMAIN
TOM SCRAWLED ON HIS SLATE PLEASE TAKE IT I GOT MORE THE
GIRL GLANCED AT THE WORDS BUT MADE NO SIGN
NOW THE BOY BEGAN TO DRAW
SOMETHING ON THE SLATE HIDING HIS WORK WITH HIS LEFT HAND
FOR A TIME
THE GIRL REFUSED TO NOTICE BUT HER HUMAN CURIOSITY PRESENTLY BEGAN
TO MANIFEST ITSELF BY HARDLY PERCEPTIBLE SIGNS
THE BOY WORKED ON
APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS
THE GIRL MADE A SORT OF NON COMMITTAL ATTEMPT
TO SEE BUT THE BOY DID NOT BETRAY THAT HE WAS AWARE OF IT
AT LAST SHE
GAVE IN AND HESITATINGLY WHISPERED
LET ME SEE IT
TOM PARTLY UNCOVERED A DISMAL CARICATURE OF A HOUSE WITH TWO GABLE ENDS
TO IT AND A CORKSCREW OF SMOKE ISSUING FROM THE CHIMNEY
THEN THE GIRL'S
INTEREST BEGAN TO FASTEN ITSELF UPON THE WORK AND SHE FORGOT EVERYTHING
ELSE
WHEN IT WAS FINISHED SHE GAZED A MOMENT THEN WHISPERED
IT'S NICE MAKE A MAN
THE ARTIST ERECTED A MAN IN THE FRONT YARD THAT RESEMBLED A DERRICK
HE
COULD HAVE STEPPED OVER THE HOUSE BUT THE GIRL WAS NOT HYPERCRITICAL
SHE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE MONSTER AND WHISPERED
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MAN NOW MAKE ME COMING ALONG
TOM DREW AN HOUR GLASS WITH A FULL MOON AND STRAW LIMBS TO IT AND ARMED
THE SPREADING FINGERS WITH A PORTENTOUS FAN
THE GIRL SAID
IT'S EVER SO NICE I WISH I COULD DRAW
IT'S EASY WHISPERED TOM I'LL LEARN YOU
OH WILL YOU WHEN
AT NOON
DO YOU GO HOME TO DINNER
I'LL STAY IF YOU WILL
GOOD THAT'S A WHACK
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
BECKY THATCHER
WHAT'S YOURS OH I KNOW
IT'S THOMAS SAWYER
THAT'S THE NAME THEY LICK ME BY
I'M TOM WHEN I'M GOOD
YOU CALL ME
TOM WILL YOU
YES
NOW TOM BEGAN TO SCRAWL SOMETHING ON THE SLATE HIDING THE WORDS FROM
THE GIRL
BUT SHE WAS NOT BACKWARD THIS TIME
SHE BEGGED TO SEE
TOM
SAID
OH IT AIN'T ANYTHING
YES IT IS
NO IT AIN'T
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
YES I DO INDEED I DO
PLEASE LET ME
YOU'LL TELL
NO I WON'T DEED AND DEED AND DOUBLE DEED WON'T
YOU WON'T TELL ANYBODY AT ALL EVER AS LONG AS YOU LIVE
NO I WON'T EVER TELL ANY BODY
NOW LET ME
OH YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE
NOW THAT YOU TREAT ME SO I WILL SEE AND SHE PUT HER SMALL HAND
UPON HIS AND A LITTLE SCUFFLE ENSUED TOM PRETENDING TO RESIST IN
EARNEST BUT LETTING HIS HAND SLIP BY DEGREES TILL THESE WORDS WERE
REVEALED I LOVE YOU
OH YOU BAD THING AND SHE HIT HIS HAND A SMART RAP BUT REDDENED AND
LOOKED PLEASED NEVERTHELESS
JUST AT THIS JUNCTURE THE BOY FELT A SLOW FATEFUL GRIP CLOSING ON HIS
EAR AND A STEADY LIFTING IMPULSE
IN THAT WISE HE WAS BORNE ACROSS THE
HOUSE AND DEPOSITED IN HIS OWN SEAT UNDER A PEPPERING FIRE OF GIGGLES
FROM THE WHOLE SCHOOL
THEN THE MASTER STOOD OVER HIM DURING A FEW AWFUL
MOMENTS AND FINALLY MOVED AWAY TO HIS THRONE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD
BUT
ALTHOUGH TOM'S EAR TINGLED HIS HEART WAS JUBILANT
AS THE SCHOOL QUIETED DOWN TOM MADE AN HONEST EFFORT TO STUDY BUT
THE TURMOIL WITHIN HIM WAS TOO GREAT
IN TURN HE TOOK HIS PLACE IN THE
READING CLASS AND MADE A BOTCH OF IT THEN IN THE GEOGRAPHY CLASS AND
TURNED LAKES INTO MOUNTAINS MOUNTAINS INTO RIVERS AND RIVERS INTO
CONTINENTS TILL CHAOS WAS COME AGAIN THEN IN THE SPELLING CLASS AND
GOT TURNED DOWN BY A SUCCESSION OF MERE BABY WORDS TILL HE BROUGHT
UP AT THE FOOT AND YIELDED UP THE PEWTER MEDAL WHICH HE HAD WORN WITH
OSTENTATION FOR MONTHS
CHAPTER VII
THE HARDER TOM TRIED TO FASTEN HIS MIND ON HIS BOOK THE MORE HIS IDEAS
WANDERED
SO AT LAST WITH A SIGH AND A YAWN HE GAVE IT UP
IT SEEMED
TO HIM THAT THE NOON RECESS WOULD NEVER COME
THE AIR WAS UTTERLY DEAD
THERE WAS NOT A BREATH STIRRING
IT WAS THE SLEEPIEST OF SLEEPY DAYS
THE DROWSING MURMUR OF THE FIVE AND TWENTY STUDYING SCHOLARS SOOTHED
THE SOUL LIKE THE SPELL THAT IS IN THE MURMUR OF BEES
AWAY OFF IN THE
FLAMING SUNSHINE CARDIFF HILL LIFTED ITS SOFT GREEN SIDES THROUGH A
SHIMMERING VEIL OF HEAT TINTED WITH THE PURPLE OF DISTANCE A FEW BIRDS
FLOATED ON LAZY WING HIGH IN THE AIR NO OTHER LIVING THING WAS VISIBLE
BUT SOME COWS AND THEY WERE ASLEEP
TOM'S HEART ACHED TO BE FREE OR
ELSE TO HAVE SOMETHING OF INTEREST TO DO TO PASS THE DREARY TIME
HIS HAND WANDERED INTO HIS POCKET AND HIS FACE LIT UP WITH A GLOW OF
GRATITUDE THAT WAS PRAYER THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW IT
THEN FURTIVELY
THE PERCUSSION CAP BOX CAME OUT
HE RELEASED THE TICK AND PUT HIM ON
THE LONG FLAT DESK
THE CREATURE PROBABLY GLOWED WITH A GRATITUDE THAT
AMOUNTED TO PRAYER TOO AT THIS MOMENT BUT IT WAS PREMATURE FOR WHEN
HE STARTED THANKFULLY TO TRAVEL OFF TOM TURNED HIM ASIDE WITH A PIN AND
MADE HIM TAKE A NEW DIRECTION
TOM'S BOSOM FRIEND SAT NEXT HIM SUFFERING JUST AS TOM HAD BEEN AND
NOW HE WAS DEEPLY AND GRATEFULLY INTERESTED IN THIS ENTERTAINMENT IN
AN INSTANT
THIS BOSOM FRIEND WAS JOE HARPER
THE TWO BOYS WERE SWORN
FRIENDS ALL THE WEEK AND EMBATTLED ENEMIES ON SATURDAYS
JOE TOOK A
PIN OUT OF HIS LAPEL AND BEGAN TO ASSIST IN EXERCISING THE PRISONER
THE SPORT GREW IN INTEREST MOMENTLY
SOON TOM SAID THAT THEY WERE
INTERFERING WITH EACH OTHER AND NEITHER GETTING THE FULLEST BENEFIT
OF THE TICK
SO HE PUT JOE'S SLATE ON THE DESK AND DREW A LINE DOWN THE
MIDDLE OF IT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
NOW SAID HE AS LONG AS HE IS ON YOUR SIDE YOU CAN STIR HIM UP AND
I'LL LET HIM ALONE BUT IF YOU LET HIM GET AWAY AND GET ON MY SIDE
YOU'RE TO LEAVE HIM ALONE AS LONG AS I CAN KEEP HIM FROM CROSSING OVER
ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD START HIM UP
THE TICK ESCAPED FROM TOM PRESENTLY AND CROSSED THE EQUATOR
JOE
HARASSED HIM AWHILE AND THEN HE GOT AWAY AND CROSSED BACK AGAIN
THIS
CHANGE OF BASE OCCURRED OFTEN
WHILE ONE BOY WAS WORRYING THE TICK WITH
ABSORBING INTEREST THE OTHER WOULD LOOK ON WITH INTEREST AS STRONG THE
TWO HEADS BOWED TOGETHER OVER THE SLATE AND THE TWO SOULS DEAD TO ALL
THINGS ELSE
AT LAST LUCK SEEMED TO SETTLE AND ABIDE WITH JOE
THE
TICK TRIED THIS THAT AND THE OTHER COURSE AND GOT AS EXCITED AND AS
ANXIOUS AS THE BOYS THEMSELVES BUT TIME AND AGAIN JUST AS HE WOULD
HAVE VICTORY IN HIS VERY GRASP SO TO SPEAK AND TOM'S FINGERS WOULD
BE TWITCHING TO BEGIN JOE'S PIN WOULD DEFTLY HEAD HIM OFF AND KEEP
POSSESSION
AT LAST TOM COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
THE TEMPTATION WAS TOO
STRONG
SO HE REACHED OUT AND LENT A HAND WITH HIS PIN
JOE WAS ANGRY IN
A MOMENT
SAID HE
TOM YOU LET HIM ALONE
I ONLY JUST WANT TO STIR HIM UP A LITTLE JOE
NO SIR IT AIN'T FAIR YOU JUST LET HIM ALONE
BLAME IT I AIN'T GOING TO STIR HIM MUCH
LET HIM ALONE I TELL YOU
I WON'T
YOU SHALL HE'S ON MY SIDE OF THE LINE
LOOK HERE JOE HARPER WHOSE IS THAT TICK
I DON'T CARE WHOSE TICK HE IS HE'S ON MY SIDE OF THE LINE AND YOU
SHA'N'T TOUCH HIM
WELL I'LL JUST BET I WILL THOUGH
HE'S MY TICK AND I'LL DO WHAT I
BLAME PLEASE WITH HIM OR DIE
A TREMENDOUS WHACK CAME DOWN ON TOM'S SHOULDERS AND ITS DUPLICATE ON
JOE'S AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES THE DUST CONTINUED TO FLY FROM
THE TWO JACKETS AND THE WHOLE SCHOOL TO ENJOY IT
THE BOYS HAD BEEN
TOO ABSORBED TO NOTICE THE HUSH THAT HAD STOLEN UPON THE SCHOOL AWHILE
BEFORE WHEN THE MASTER CAME TIPTOEING DOWN THE ROOM AND STOOD OVER THEM
HE HAD CONTEMPLATED A GOOD PART OF THE PERFORMANCE BEFORE HE CONTRIBUTED
HIS BIT OF VARIETY TO IT
WHEN SCHOOL BROKE UP AT NOON TOM FLEW TO BECKY THATCHER AND WHISPERED
IN HER EAR
PUT ON YOUR BONNET AND LET ON YOU'RE GOING HOME AND WHEN YOU GET TO
THE CORNER GIVE THE REST OF 'EM THE SLIP AND TURN DOWN THROUGH THE
LANE AND COME BACK
I'LL GO THE OTHER WAY AND COME IT OVER 'EM THE SAME
WAY
SO THE ONE WENT OFF WITH ONE GROUP OF SCHOLARS AND THE OTHER WITH
ANOTHER
IN A LITTLE WHILE THE TWO MET AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LANE AND
WHEN THEY REACHED THE SCHOOL THEY HAD IT ALL TO THEMSELVES
THEN THEY
SAT TOGETHER WITH A SLATE BEFORE THEM AND TOM GAVE BECKY THE PENCIL
AND HELD HER HAND IN HIS GUIDING IT AND SO CREATED ANOTHER SURPRISING
HOUSE
WHEN THE INTEREST IN ART BEGAN TO WANE THE TWO FELL TO TALKING
TOM WAS SWIMMING IN BLISS
HE SAID
DO YOU LOVE RATS
NO I HATE THEM
WELL I DO TOO LIVE ONES
BUT I MEAN DEAD ONES TO SWING ROUND YOUR
HEAD WITH A STRING
NO I DON'T CARE FOR RATS MUCH ANYWAY
WHAT I LIKE IS CHEWING GUM
OH I SHOULD SAY SO I WISH I HAD SOME NOW
DO YOU I'VE GOT SOME
I'LL LET YOU CHEW IT AWHILE BUT YOU MUST GIVE
IT BACK TO ME
THAT WAS AGREEABLE SO THEY CHEWED IT TURN ABOUT AND DANGLED THEIR LEGS
AGAINST THE BENCH IN EXCESS OF CONTENTMENT
WAS YOU EVER AT A CIRCUS SAID TOM
YES AND MY PA'S GOING TO TAKE ME AGAIN SOME TIME IF I'M GOOD
I BEEN TO THE CIRCUS THREE OR FOUR TIMES LOTS OF TIMES
CHURCH AIN'T
SHUCKS TO A CIRCUS
THERE'S THINGS GOING ON AT A CIRCUS ALL THE TIME
I'M GOING TO BE A CLOWN IN A CIRCUS WHEN I GROW UP
OH ARE YOU THAT WILL BE NICE
THEY'RE SO LOVELY ALL SPOTTED UP
YES THAT'S SO
AND THEY GET SLATHERS OF MONEY MOST A DOLLAR A DAY BEN

WHITE APRON TO HER FACE

OH IT'S EVER SO GAY WHY ME AND AMY LAWRENCE
THE BIG EYES TOLD TOM HIS BLUNDER AND HE STOPPED CONFUSED
OH TOM THEN I AIN'T THE FIRST YOU'VE EVER BEEN ENGAGED TO
THE CHILD BEGAN TO CRY
TOM SAID
OH DON'T CRY BECKY I DON'T CARE FOR HER ANY MORE
YES YOU DO TOM YOU KNOW YOU DO
TOM TRIED TO PUT HIS ARM ABOUT HER NECK BUT SHE PUSHED HIM AWAY AND
TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND WENT ON CRYING
TOM TRIED AGAIN WITH
SOOTHING WORDS IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS REPULSED AGAIN
THEN HIS PRIDE WAS
UP AND HE STRODE AWAY AND WENT OUTSIDE
HE STOOD ABOUT RESTLESS AND
UNEASY FOR A WHILE GLANCING AT THE DOOR EVERY NOW AND THEN HOPING
SHE WOULD REPENT AND COME TO FIND HIM
BUT SHE DID NOT
THEN HE BEGAN
TO FEEL BADLY AND FEAR THAT HE WAS IN THE WRONG
IT WAS A HARD STRUGGLE
WITH HIM TO MAKE NEW ADVANCES NOW BUT HE NERVED HIMSELF TO IT AND
ENTERED
SHE WAS STILL STANDING BACK THERE IN THE CORNER SOBBING WITH
HER FACE TO THE WALL
TOM'S HEART SMOTE HIM
HE WENT TO HER AND STOOD A
MOMENT NOT KNOWING EXACTLY HOW TO PROCEED
THEN HE SAID HESITATINGLY
BECKY I I DON'T CARE FOR ANYBODY BUT YOU
NO REPLY BUT SOBS
BECKY PLEADINGLY
BECKY WON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
MORE SOBS
TOM GOT OUT HIS CHIEFEST JEWEL A BRASS KNOB FROM THE TOP OF AN ANDIRON
AND PASSED IT AROUND HER SO THAT SHE COULD SEE IT AND SAID
PLEASE BECKY WON'T YOU TAKE IT
SHE STRUCK IT TO THE FLOOR
THEN TOM MARCHED OUT OF THE HOUSE AND OVER
THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY TO RETURN TO SCHOOL NO MORE THAT DAY
PRESENTLY
BECKY BEGAN TO SUSPECT
SHE RAN TO THE DOOR HE WAS NOT IN SIGHT SHE
FLEW AROUND TO THE PLAY YARD HE WAS NOT THERE
THEN SHE CALLED
TOM COME BACK TOM
SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER
SHE HAD NO COMPANIONS
BUT SILENCE AND LONELINESS
SO SHE SAT DOWN TO CRY AGAIN AND UPBRAID
HERSELF AND BY THIS TIME THE SCHOLARS BEGAN TO GATHER AGAIN AND SHE
HAD TO HIDE HER GRIEFS AND STILL HER BROKEN HEART AND TAKE UP THE CROSS
OF A LONG DREARY ACHING AFTERNOON WITH NONE AMONG THE STRANGERS ABOUT
HER TO EXCHANGE SORROWS WITH
CHAPTER VIII
TOM DODGED HITHER AND THITHER THROUGH LANES UNTIL HE WAS WELL OUT OF THE
TRACK OF RETURNING SCHOLARS AND THEN FELL INTO A MOODY JOG
HE CROSSED
A SMALL BRANCH TWO OR THREE TIMES BECAUSE OF A PREVAILING JUVENILE
SUPERSTITION THAT TO CROSS WATER BAFFLED PURSUIT
HALF AN HOUR LATER
HE WAS DISAPPEARING BEHIND THE DOUGLAS MANSION ON THE SUMMIT OF CARDIFF
HILL AND THE SCHOOL HOUSE WAS HARDLY DISTINGUISHABLE AWAY OFF IN THE
VALLEY BEHIND HIM
HE ENTERED A DENSE WOOD PICKED HIS PATHLESS WAY TO
THE CENTRE OF IT AND SAT DOWN ON A MOSSY SPOT UNDER A SPREADING OAK
THERE WAS NOT EVEN A ZEPHYR STIRRING THE DEAD NOONDAY HEAT HAD EVEN
STILLED THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS NATURE LAY IN A TRANCE THAT WAS BROKEN
BY NO SOUND BUT THE OCCASIONAL FAR OFF HAMMERING OF A WOOD PECKER AND
THIS SEEMED TO RENDER THE PERVADING SILENCE AND SENSE OF LONELINESS THE
MORE PROFOUND
THE BOY'S SOUL WAS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS FEELINGS
WERE IN HAPPY ACCORD WITH HIS SURROUNDINGS
HE SAT LONG WITH HIS ELBOWS
ON HIS KNEES AND HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS MEDITATING
IT SEEMED TO HIM
THAT LIFE WAS BUT A TROUBLE AT BEST AND HE MORE THAN HALF ENVIED JIMMY
HODGES SO LATELY RELEASED IT MUST BE VERY PEACEFUL HE THOUGHT TO LIE
AND SLUMBER AND DREAM FOREVER AND EVER WITH THE WIND WHISPERING THROUGH
THE TREES AND CARESSING THE GRASS AND THE FLOWERS OVER THE GRAVE AND
NOTHING TO BOTHER AND GRIEVE ABOUT EVER ANY MORE
IF HE ONLY HAD A
CLEAN SUNDAY SCHOOL RECORD HE COULD BE WILLING TO GO AND BE DONE WITH
IT ALL
NOW AS TO THIS GIRL
WHAT HAD HE DONE NOTHING
HE HAD MEANT
THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND BEEN TREATED LIKE A DOG LIKE A VERY DOG
SHE
WOULD BE SORRY SOME DAY MAYBE WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
AH IF HE COULD ONLY
DIE TEMPORARILY
BUT THE ELASTIC HEART OF YOUTH CANNOT BE COMPRESSED INTO ONE CONSTRAINED
SHAPE LONG AT A TIME
TOM PRESENTLY BEGAN TO DRIFT INSENSIBLY BACK INTO
THE CONCERNS OF THIS LIFE AGAIN
WHAT IF HE TURNED HIS BACK NOW AND
DISAPPEARED MYSTERIOUSLY WHAT IF HE WENT AWAY EVER SO FAR AWAY INTO
UNKNOWN COUNTRIES BEYOND THE SEAS AND NEVER CAME BACK ANY MORE HOW
WOULD SHE FEEL THEN THE IDEA OF BEING A CLOWN RECURRED TO HIM NOW ONLY
TO FILL HIM WITH DISGUST
FOR FRIVOLITY AND JOKES AND SPOTTED TIGHTS
WERE AN OFFENSE WHEN THEY INTRUDED THEMSELVES UPON A SPIRIT THAT WAS
EXALTED INTO THE VAGUE AUGUST REALM OF THE ROMANTIC
NO HE WOULD BE
A SOLDIER AND RETURN AFTER LONG YEARS ALL WAR WORN AND ILLUSTRIOUS
NO BETTER STILL HE WOULD JOIN THE INDIANS AND HUNT BUFFALOES AND GO ON
THE WARPATH IN THE MOUNTAIN RANGES AND THE TRACKLESS GREAT PLAINS OF THE
FAR WEST AND AWAY IN THE FUTURE COME BACK A GREAT CHIEF BRISTLING WITH
FEATHERS HIDEOUS WITH PAINT AND PRANCE INTO SUNDAY SCHOOL SOME DROWSY
SUMMER MORNING WITH A BLOOD CURDLING WAR WHOOP AND SEAR THE EYEBALLS
OF ALL HIS COMPANIONS WITH UNAPPEASABLE ENVY
BUT NO THERE WAS
SOMETHING GAUDIER EVEN THAN THIS
HE WOULD BE A PIRATE THAT WAS IT
NOW HIS FUTURE LAY PLAIN BEFORE HIM AND GLOWING WITH UNIMAGINABLE
SPLENDOR
HOW HIS NAME WOULD FILL THE WORLD AND MAKE PEOPLE SHUDDER
HOW GLORIOUSLY HE WOULD GO PLOWING THE DANCING SEAS IN HIS LONG LOW
BLACK HULLED RACER THE SPIRIT OF THE STORM WITH HIS GRISLY FLAG FLYING
AT THE FORE AND AT THE ZENITH OF HIS FAME HOW HE WOULD SUDDENLY APPEAR
AT THE OLD VILLAGE AND STALK INTO CHURCH BROWN AND WEATHER BEATEN IN
HIS BLACK VELVET DOUBLET AND TRUNKS HIS GREAT JACK BOOTS HIS CRIMSON
SASH HIS BELT BRISTLING WITH HORSE PISTOLS HIS CRIME RUSTED CUTLASS
AT HIS SIDE HIS SLOUCH HAT WITH WAVING PLUMES HIS BLACK FLAG UNFURLED
WITH THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES ON IT AND HEAR WITH SWELLING ECSTASY
THE WHISPERINGS IT'S TOM SAWYER THE PIRATE THE BLACK AVENGER OF THE
SPANISH MAIN
YES IT WAS SETTLED HIS CAREER WAS DETERMINED
HE WOULD RUN AWAY FROM
HOME AND ENTER UPON IT
HE WOULD START THE VERY NEXT MORNING
THEREFORE
HE MUST NOW BEGIN TO GET READY
HE WOULD COLLECT HIS RESOURCES TOGETHER
HE WENT TO A ROTTEN LOG NEAR AT HAND AND BEGAN TO DIG UNDER ONE END OF
IT WITH HIS BARLOW KNIFE
HE SOON STRUCK WOOD THAT SOUNDED HOLLOW
HE
PUT HIS HAND THERE AND UTTERED THIS INCANTATION IMPRESSIVELY
WHAT HASN'T COME HERE COME WHAT'S HERE STAY HERE
THEN HE SCRAPED AWAY THE DIRT AND EXPOSED A PINE SHINGLE
HE TOOK IT
UP AND DISCLOSED A SHAPELY LITTLE TREASURE HOUSE WHOSE BOTTOM AND SIDES
WERE OF SHINGLES
IN IT LAY A MARBLE
TOM'S ASTONISHMENT WAS BOUND LESS
HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD WITH A PERPLEXED AIR AND SAID
WELL THAT BEATS ANYTHING
THEN HE TOSSED THE MARBLE AWAY PETTISHLY AND STOOD COGITATING
THE
TRUTH WAS THAT A SUPERSTITION OF HIS HAD FAILED HERE WHICH HE AND
ALL HIS COMRADES HAD ALWAYS LOOKED UPON AS INFALLIBLE
IF YOU BURIED
A MARBLE WITH CERTAIN NECESSARY INCANTATIONS AND LEFT IT ALONE A
FORTNIGHT AND THEN OPENED THE PLACE WITH THE INCANTATION HE HAD JUST
USED YOU WOULD FIND THAT ALL THE MARBLES YOU HAD EVER LOST HAD GATHERED
THEMSELVES TOGETHER THERE MEANTIME NO MATTER HOW WIDELY THEY HAD BEEN
SEPARATED
BUT NOW THIS THING HAD ACTUALLY AND UNQUESTIONABLY FAILED
TOM'S WHOLE STRUCTURE OF FAITH WAS SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS
HE HAD
MANY A TIME HEARD OF THIS THING SUCCEEDING BUT NEVER OF ITS FAILING
BEFORE
IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM THAT HE HAD TRIED IT SEVERAL TIMES
BEFORE HIMSELF BUT COULD NEVER FIND THE HIDING PLACES AFTERWARD
HE
PUZZLED OVER THE MATTER SOME TIME AND FINALLY DECIDED THAT SOME WITCH
HAD INTERFERED AND BROKEN THE CHARM
HE THOUGHT HE WOULD SATISFY HIMSELF
ON THAT POINT SO HE SEARCHED AROUND TILL HE FOUND A SMALL SANDY SPOT
WITH A LITTLE FUNNEL SHAPED DEPRESSION IN IT
HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND
PUT HIS MOUTH CLOSE TO THIS DEPRESSION AND CALLED
DOODLE BUG DOODLE BUG TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW DOODLE BUG
DOODLE BUG TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
THE SAND BEGAN TO WORK AND PRESENTLY A SMALL BLACK BUG APPEARED FOR A
SECOND AND THEN DARTED UNDER AGAIN IN A FRIGHT
HE DASN'T TELL SO IT WAS A WITCH THAT DONE IT
I JUST KNOWED IT
HE WELL KNEW THE FUTILITY OF TRYING TO CONTEND AGAINST WITCHES SO HE
GAVE UP DISCOURAGED
BUT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
THE MARBLE HE HAD JUST THROWN AWAY AND THEREFORE HE WENT AND MADE A
PATIENT SEARCH FOR IT
BUT HE COULD NOT FIND IT
NOW HE WENT BACK TO HIS
TREASURE HOUSE AND CAREFULLY PLACED HIMSELF JUST AS HE HAD BEEN STANDING
WHEN HE TOSSED THE MARBLE AWAY THEN HE TOOK ANOTHER MARBLE FROM HIS
POCKET AND TOSSED IT IN THE SAME WAY SAYING
BROTHER GO FIND YOUR BROTHER
HE WATCHED WHERE IT STOPPED AND WENT THERE AND LOOKED
BUT IT MUST
HAVE FALLEN SHORT OR GONE TOO FAR SO HE TRIED TWICE MORE
THE LAST
REPETITION WAS SUCCESSFUL
THE TWO MARBLES LAY WITHIN A FOOT OF EACH
OTHER
JUST HERE THE BLAST OF A TOY TIN TRUMPET CAME FAINTLY DOWN THE GREEN
AISLES OF THE FOREST
TOM FLUNG OFF HIS JACKET AND TROUSERS TURNED
A SUSPENDER INTO A BELT RAKED AWAY SOME BRUSH BEHIND THE ROTTEN LOG
DISCLOSING A RUDE BOW AND ARROW A LATH SWORD AND A TIN TRUMPET AND
IN A MOMENT HAD SEIZED THESE THINGS AND BOUNDED AWAY BARELEGGED
WITH FLUTTERING SHIRT
HE PRESENTLY HALTED UNDER A GREAT ELM BLEW AN
ANSWERING BLAST AND THEN BEGAN TO TIPTOE AND LOOK WARILY OUT THIS WAY
AND THAT
HE SAID CAUTIOUSLY TO AN IMAGINARY COMPANY
HOLD MY MERRY MEN KEEP HID TILL I BLOW
NOW APPEARED JOE HARPER AS AIRILY CLAD AND ELABORATELY ARMED AS TOM
TOM CALLED
HOLD WHO COMES HERE INTO SHERWOOD FOREST WITHOUT MY PASS
GUY OF GUISBORNE WANTS NO MAN'S PASS
WHO ART THOU THAT THAT
DARES TO HOLD SUCH LANGUAGE SAID TOM PROMPTING FOR THEY TALKED BY
THE BOOK FROM MEMORY
WHO ART THOU THAT DARES TO HOLD SUCH LANGUAGE
I INDEED I AM ROBIN HOOD AS THY CAITIFF CARCASE SOON SHALL KNOW
THEN ART THOU INDEED THAT FAMOUS OUTLAW RIGHT GLADLY WILL I DISPUTE
WITH THEE THE PASSES OF THE MERRY WOOD
HAVE AT THEE
THEY TOOK THEIR LATH SWORDS DUMPED THEIR OTHER TRAPS ON THE GROUND
STRUCK A FENCING ATTITUDE FOOT TO FOOT AND BEGAN A GRAVE CAREFUL
COMBAT TWO UP AND TWO DOWN PRESENTLY TOM SAID
NOW IF YOU'VE GOT THE HANG GO IT LIVELY
SO THEY WENT IT LIVELY PANTING AND PERSPIRING WITH THE WORK
BY AND
BY TOM SHOUTED
FALL FALL WHY DON'T YOU FALL
I SHA'N'T WHY DON'T YOU FALL YOURSELF YOU'RE GETTING THE WORST OF
IT
WHY THAT AIN'T ANYTHING
I CAN'T FALL THAT AIN'T THE WAY IT IS IN THE
BOOK
THE BOOK SAYS 'THEN WITH ONE BACK HANDED STROKE HE SLEW POOR GUY
OF GUISBORNE YOU'RE TO TURN AROUND AND LET ME HIT YOU IN THE BACK
THERE WAS NO GETTING AROUND THE AUTHORITIES SO JOE TURNED RECEIVED THE
WHACK AND FELL
NOW SAID JOE GETTING UP YOU GOT TO LET ME KILL YOU
THAT'S
FAIR
WHY I CAN'T DO THAT IT AIN'T IN THE BOOK
WELL IT'S BLAMED MEAN THAT'S ALL
WELL SAY JOE YOU CAN BE FRIAR TUCK OR MUCH THE MILLER'S SON AND LAM
ME WITH A QUARTER STAFF OR I'LL BE THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM AND YOU BE
ROBIN HOOD A LITTLE WHILE AND KILL ME
THIS WAS SATISFACTORY AND SO THESE ADVENTURES WERE CARRIED OUT
THEN
TOM BECAME ROBIN HOOD AGAIN AND WAS ALLOWED BY THE TREACHEROUS NUN TO
BLEED HIS STRENGTH AWAY THROUGH HIS NEGLECTED WOUND
AND AT LAST JOE
REPRESENTING A WHOLE TRIBE OF WEEPING OUTLAWS DRAGGED HIM SADLY FORTH
GAVE HIS BOW INTO HIS FEEBLE HANDS AND TOM SAID WHERE THIS ARROW
FALLS THERE BURY POOR ROBIN HOOD UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE THEN HE
SHOT THE ARROW AND FELL BACK AND WOULD HAVE DIED BUT HE LIT ON A NETTLE
AND SPRANG UP TOO GAILY FOR A CORPSE
THE BOYS DRESSED THEMSELVES HID THEIR ACCOUTREMENTS AND WENT OFF
GRIEVING THAT THERE WERE NO OUTLAWS ANY MORE AND WONDERING WHAT MODERN
CIVILIZATION COULD CLAIM TO HAVE DONE TO COMPENSATE FOR THEIR LOSS
THEY SAID THEY WOULD RATHER BE OUTLAWS A YEAR IN SHERWOOD FOREST THAN
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES FOREVER
CHAPTER IX
AT HALF PAST NINE THAT NIGHT TOM AND SID WERE SENT TO BED AS USUAL
THEY SAID THEIR PRAYERS AND SID WAS SOON ASLEEP
TOM LAY AWAKE AND
WAITED IN RESTLESS IMPATIENCE
WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT MUST BE
NEARLY DAYLIGHT HE HEARD THE CLOCK STRIKE TEN THIS WAS DESPAIR
HE
WOULD HAVE TOSSED AND FIDGETED AS HIS NERVES DEMANDED BUT HE WAS
AFRAID HE MIGHT WAKE SID
SO HE LAY STILL AND STARED UP INTO THE DARK
EVERYTHING WAS DISMALLY STILL
BY AND BY OUT OF THE STILLNESS LITTLE
SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE NOISES BEGAN TO EMPHASIZE THEMSELVES
THE TICKING
OF THE CLOCK BEGAN TO BRING ITSELF INTO NOTICE
OLD BEAMS BEGAN TO CRACK
MYSTERIOUSLY
THE STAIRS CREAKED FAINTLY
EVIDENTLY SPIRITS WERE ABROAD
A MEASURED MUFFLED SNORE ISSUED FROM AUNT POLLY'S CHAMBER
AND NOW THE
TIRESOME CHIRPING OF A CRICKET THAT NO HUMAN INGENUITY COULD LOCATE
BEGAN
NEXT THE GHASTLY TICKING OF A DEATH WATCH IN THE WALL AT THE
BED'S HEAD MADE TOM SHUDDER IT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY'S DAYS WERE NUMBERED
THEN THE HOWL OF A FAR OFF DOG ROSE ON THE NIGHT AIR AND WAS ANSWERED
BY A FAINTER HOWL FROM A REMOTER DISTANCE
TOM WAS IN AN AGONY
AT LAST
HE WAS SATISFIED THAT TIME HAD CEASED AND ETERNITY BEGUN HE BEGAN TO
DOZE IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THE CLOCK CHIMED ELEVEN BUT HE DID NOT HEAR
IT
AND THEN THERE CAME MINGLING WITH HIS HALF FORMED DREAMS A MOST
MELANCHOLY CATERWAULING
THE RAISING OF A NEIGHBORING WINDOW DISTURBED
HIM
A CRY OF SCAT YOU DEVIL AND THE CRASH OF AN EMPTY BOTTLE
AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS AUNT'S WOODSHED BROUGHT HIM WIDE AWAKE AND A
SINGLE MINUTE LATER HE WAS DRESSED AND OUT OF THE WINDOW AND CREEPING
ALONG THE ROOF OF THE ELL ON ALL FOURS
HE MEOW'D WITH CAUTION ONCE
OR TWICE AS HE WENT THEN JUMPED TO THE ROOF OF THE WOODSHED AND THENCE
TO THE GROUND
HUCKLEBERRY FINN WAS THERE WITH HIS DEAD CAT
THE BOYS
MOVED OFF AND DISAPPEARED IN THE GLOOM
AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR THEY
WERE WADING THROUGH THE TALL GRASS OF THE GRAVEYARD
IT WAS A GRAVEYARD OF THE OLD FASHIONED WESTERN KIND
IT WAS ON A HILL
ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE VILLAGE
IT HAD A CRAZY BOARD FENCE
AROUND IT WHICH LEANED INWARD IN PLACES AND OUTWARD THE REST OF THE
TIME BUT STOOD UPRIGHT NOWHERE
GRASS AND WEEDS GREW RANK OVER THE
WHOLE CEMETERY
ALL THE OLD GRAVES WERE SUNKEN IN THERE WAS NOT A
TOMBSTONE ON THE PLACE ROUND TOPPED WORM EATEN BOARDS STAGGERED OVER
THE GRAVES LEANING FOR SUPPORT AND FINDING NONE
SACRED TO THE MEMORY
OF SO AND SO HAD BEEN PAINTED ON THEM ONCE BUT IT COULD NO LONGER HAVE
BEEN READ ON THE MOST OF THEM NOW EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN LIGHT
A FAINT WIND MOANED THROUGH THE TREES AND TOM FEARED IT MIGHT BE THE
SPIRITS OF THE DEAD COMPLAINING AT BEING DISTURBED
THE BOYS TALKED
LITTLE AND ONLY UNDER THEIR BREATH FOR THE TIME AND THE PLACE AND THE
PERVADING SOLEMNITY AND SILENCE OPPRESSED THEIR SPIRITS
THEY FOUND THE
SHARP NEW HEAP THEY WERE SEEKING AND ENSCONCED THEMSELVES WITHIN THE
PROTECTION OF THREE GREAT ELMS THAT GREW IN A BUNCH WITHIN A FEW FEET OF
THE GRAVE
THEN THEY WAITED IN SILENCE FOR WHAT SEEMED A LONG TIME
THE HOOTING OF
A DISTANT OWL WAS ALL THE SOUND THAT TROUBLED THE DEAD STILLNESS
TOM'S
REFLECTIONS GREW OPPRESSIVE
HE MUST FORCE SOME TALK
SO HE SAID IN A
WHISPER
HUCKY DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD PEOPLE LIKE IT FOR US TO BE HERE
HUCKLEBERRY WHISPERED
I WISHT I KNOWED
IT'S AWFUL SOLEMN LIKE AIN'T IT
I BET IT IS
THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE WHILE THE BOYS CANVASSED THIS MATTER
INWARDLY
THEN TOM WHISPERED
SAY HUCKY DO YOU RECKON HOSS WILLIAMS HEARS US TALKING
O' COURSE HE DOES
LEAST HIS SPERRIT DOES
TOM AFTER A PAUSE
I WISH I'D SAID MISTER WILLIAMS
BUT I NEVER MEANT ANY HARM

ALL
I'LL TRY TO TOM BUT LORD I'M ALL OF A SHIVER

THE BOYS BENT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND SCARCELY BREATHED
A MUFFLED
SOUND OF VOICES FLOATED UP FROM THE FAR END OF THE GRAVEYARD
LOOK SEE THERE WHISPERED TOM
WHAT IS IT
IT'S DEVIL FIRE
OH TOM THIS IS AWFUL
SOME VAGUE FIGURES APPROACHED THROUGH THE GLOOM SWINGING AN
OLD FASHIONED TIN LANTERN THAT FRECKLED THE GROUND WITH INNUMERABLE
LITTLE SPANGLES OF LIGHT
PRESENTLY HUCKLEBERRY WHISPERED WITH A
SHUDDER
IT'S THE DEVILS SURE ENOUGH

SIGHT
WHAT KIN THEY BE UP TO
THE WHISPER DIED WHOLLY OUT NOW FOR THE THREE MEN HAD REACHED THE
GRAVE AND STOOD WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE BOYS' HIDING PLACE
HERE IT IS SAID THE THIRD VOICE AND THE OWNER OF IT HELD THE LANTERN
UP AND REVEALED THE FACE OF YOUNG DOCTOR ROBINSON
POTTER AND INJUN JOE WERE CARRYING A HANDBARROW WITH A ROPE AND A COUPLE
OF SHOVELS ON IT
THEY CAST DOWN THEIR LOAD AND BEGAN TO OPEN THE GRAVE
THE DOCTOR PUT THE LANTERN AT THE HEAD OF THE GRAVE AND CAME AND SAT
DOWN WITH HIS BACK AGAINST ONE OF THE ELM TREES
HE WAS SO CLOSE THE
BOYS COULD HAVE TOUCHED HIM
HURRY MEN HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE THE MOON MIGHT COME OUT AT ANY
MOMENT
THEY GROWLED A RESPONSE AND WENT ON DIGGING
FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS NO
NOISE BUT THE GRATING SOUND OF THE SPADES DISCHARGING THEIR FREIGHT OF
MOULD AND GRAVEL
IT WAS VERY MONOTONOUS
FINALLY A SPADE STRUCK UPON
THE COFFIN WITH A DULL WOODY ACCENT AND WITHIN ANOTHER MINUTE OR TWO
THE MEN HAD HOISTED IT OUT ON THE GROUND
THEY PRIED OFF THE LID WITH
THEIR SHOVELS GOT OUT THE BODY AND DUMPED IT RUDELY ON THE GROUND
THE
MOON DRIFTED FROM BEHIND THE CLOUDS AND EXPOSED THE PALLID FACE
THE BARROW WAS GOT READY AND THE CORPSE PLACED ON IT COVERED WITH A
BLANKET AND BOUND TO ITS PLACE WITH THE ROPE
POTTER TOOK OUT A LARGE
SPRING KNIFE AND CUT OFF THE DANGLING END OF THE ROPE AND THEN SAID
NOW THE CUSSED THING'S READY SAWBONES AND YOU'LL JUST OUT WITH
ANOTHER FIVE OR HERE SHE STAYS
THAT'S THE TALK SAID INJUN JOE
LOOK HERE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN SAID THE DOCTOR
YOU REQUIRED YOUR
PAY IN ADVANCE AND I'VE PAID YOU
YES AND YOU DONE MORE THAN THAT SAID INJUN JOE APPROACHING THE
DOCTOR WHO WAS NOW STANDING
FIVE YEARS AGO YOU DROVE ME AWAY FROM
YOUR FATHER'S KITCHEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I COME TO ASK FOR SOMETHING TO
EAT AND YOU SAID I WARN'T THERE FOR ANY GOOD AND WHEN I SWORE I'D GET
EVEN WITH YOU IF IT TOOK A HUNDRED YEARS YOUR FATHER HAD ME JAILED FOR
A VAGRANT
DID YOU THINK I'D FORGET THE INJUN BLOOD AIN'T IN ME FOR
NOTHING
AND NOW I'VE GOT YOU AND YOU GOT TO SETTLE YOU KNOW
HE WAS THREATENING THE DOCTOR WITH HIS FIST IN HIS FACE BY THIS TIME
THE DOCTOR STRUCK OUT SUDDENLY AND STRETCHED THE RUFFIAN ON THE GROUND
POTTER DROPPED HIS KNIFE AND EXCLAIMED
HERE NOW DON'T YOU HIT MY PARD AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE HAD GRAPPLED
WITH THE DOCTOR AND THE TWO WERE STRUGGLING WITH MIGHT AND MAIN
TRAMPLING THE GRASS AND TEARING THE GROUND WITH THEIR HEELS
INJUN JOE
SPRANG TO HIS FEET HIS EYES FLAMING WITH PASSION SNATCHED UP POTTER'S
KNIFE AND WENT CREEPING CATLIKE AND STOOPING ROUND AND ROUND ABOUT
THE COMBATANTS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY
ALL AT ONCE THE DOCTOR FLUNG
HIMSELF FREE SEIZED THE HEAVY HEADBOARD OF WILLIAMS' GRAVE AND FELLED
POTTER TO THE EARTH WITH IT AND IN THE SAME INSTANT THE HALF BREED SAW
HIS CHANCE AND DROVE THE KNIFE TO THE HILT IN THE YOUNG MAN'S BREAST
HE
REELED AND FELL PARTLY UPON POTTER FLOODING HIM WITH HIS BLOOD AND IN
THE SAME MOMENT THE CLOUDS BLOTTED OUT THE DREADFUL SPECTACLE AND THE
TWO FRIGHTENED BOYS WENT SPEEDING AWAY IN THE DARK
PRESENTLY WHEN THE MOON EMERGED AGAIN INJUN JOE WAS STANDING OVER THE
TWO FORMS CONTEMPLATING THEM
THE DOCTOR MURMURED INARTICULATELY GAVE
A LONG GASP OR TWO AND WAS STILL
THE HALF BREED MUTTERED
THAT SCORE IS SETTLED DAMN YOU
THEN HE ROBBED THE BODY
AFTER WHICH HE PUT THE FATAL KNIFE IN POTTER'S
OPEN RIGHT HAND AND SAT DOWN ON THE DISMANTLED COFFIN
THREE FOUR FIVE
MINUTES PASSED AND THEN POTTER BEGAN TO STIR AND MOAN
HIS HAND CLOSED
UPON THE KNIFE HE RAISED IT GLANCED AT IT AND LET IT FALL WITH A
SHUDDER
THEN HE SAT UP PUSHING THE BODY FROM HIM AND GAZED AT IT AND
THEN AROUND HIM CONFUSEDLY
HIS EYES MET JOE'S
LORD HOW IS THIS JOE HE SAID
IT'S A DIRTY BUSINESS SAID JOE WITHOUT MOVING
WHAT DID YOU DO IT FOR
I I NEVER DONE IT
LOOK HERE THAT KIND OF TALK WON'T WASH
POTTER TREMBLED AND GREW WHITE
I THOUGHT I'D GOT SOBER
I'D NO BUSINESS TO DRINK TO NIGHT
BUT IT'S

AND YOU FELL FLAT AND THEN UP YOU COME ALL REELING AND STAGGERING
LIKE AND SNATCHED THE KNIFE AND JAMMED IT INTO HIM JUST AS HE FETCHED
YOU ANOTHER AWFUL CLIP AND HERE YOU'VE LAID AS DEAD AS A WEDGE TIL
NOW
OH I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS A DOING
I WISH I MAY DIE THIS MINUTE IF I
DID
IT WAS ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THE WHISKEY AND THE EXCITEMENT I RECKON
I NEVER USED A WEEPON IN MY LIFE BEFORE JOE
I'VE FOUGHT BUT NEVER
WITH WEEPONS
THEY'LL ALL SAY THAT
JOE DON'T TELL SAY YOU WON'T TELL
JOE THAT'S A GOOD FELLER
I ALWAYS LIKED YOU JOE AND STOOD UP FOR YOU

DON'T YOU REMEMBER YOU WON'T TELL WILL YOU JOE AND THE
POOR CREATURE DROPPED ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE STOLID MURDERER AND
CLASPED HIS APPEALING HANDS
NO YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN FAIR AND SQUARE WITH ME MUFF POTTER AND I

OH JOE YOU'RE AN ANGEL

COME NOW THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT
THIS AIN'T ANY TIME FOR BLUBBERING
YOU BE OFF YONDER WAY AND I'LL GO THIS
MOVE NOW AND DON'T LEAVE ANY
TRACKS BEHIND YOU
POTTER STARTED ON A TROT THAT QUICKLY INCREASED TO A RUN
THE HALF BREED
STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM
HE MUTTERED
IF HE'S AS MUCH STUNNED WITH THE LICK AND FUDDLED WITH THE RUM AS HE
HAD THE LOOK OF BEING HE WON'T THINK OF THE KNIFE TILL HE'S GONE SO
FAR HE'LL BE AFRAID TO COME BACK AFTER IT TO SUCH A PLACE BY
HIMSELF CHICKEN HEART
TWO OR THREE MINUTES LATER THE MURDERED MAN THE BLANKETED CORPSE THE
LIDLESS COFFIN AND THE OPEN GRAVE WERE UNDER NO INSPECTION BUT THE
MOON'S
THE STILLNESS WAS COMPLETE AGAIN TOO
CHAPTER X
THE TWO BOYS FLEW ON AND ON TOWARD THE VILLAGE SPEECHLESS WITH
HORROR
THEY GLANCED BACKWARD OVER THEIR SHOULDERS FROM TIME TO TIME
APPREHENSIVELY AS IF THEY FEARED THEY MIGHT BE FOLLOWED
EVERY STUMP
THAT STARTED UP IN THEIR PATH SEEMED A MAN AND AN ENEMY AND MADE THEM
CATCH THEIR BREATH AND AS THEY SPED BY SOME OUTLYING COTTAGES THAT LAY
NEAR THE VILLAGE THE BARKING OF THE AROUSED WATCH DOGS SEEMED TO GIVE
WINGS TO THEIR FEET
IF WE CAN ONLY GET TO THE OLD TANNERY BEFORE WE BREAK DOWN WHISPERED
TOM IN SHORT CATCHES BETWEEN BREATHS
I CAN'T STAND IT MUCH LONGER
HUCKLEBERRY'S HARD PANTINGS WERE HIS ONLY REPLY AND THE BOYS FIXED
THEIR EYES ON THE GOAL OF THEIR HOPES AND BENT TO THEIR WORK TO WIN IT
THEY GAINED STEADILY ON IT AND AT LAST BREAST TO BREAST THEY BURST
THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AND FELL GRATEFUL AND EXHAUSTED IN THE SHELTERING
SHADOWS BEYOND
BY AND BY THEIR PULSES SLOWED DOWN AND TOM WHISPERED
HUCKLEBERRY WHAT DO YOU RECKON'LL COME OF THIS
IF DOCTOR ROBINSON DIES I RECKON HANGING'LL COME OF IT
DO YOU THOUGH
WHY I KNOW IT TOM
TOM THOUGHT A WHILE THEN HE SAID
WHO'LL TELL WE

AS WE'RE A LAYING HERE
THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF HUCK
IF ANYBODY TELLS LET MUFF POTTER DO IT IF HE'S FOOL ENOUGH

GENERALLY DRUNK ENOUGH
TOM SAID NOTHING WENT ON THINKING
PRESENTLY HE WHISPERED
HUCK MUFF POTTER DON'T KNOW IT

BUT IF A MAN

AFTER ANOTHER REFLECTIVE SILENCE TOM SAID
HUCKY YOU SURE YOU CAN KEEP MUM
TOM WE GOT TO KEEP MUM

THAT INJUN DEVIL WOULDN'T

RUBBISHY COMMON THINGS SPECIALLY WITH GALS CUZ THEY GO BACK ON YOU
ANYWAY AND BLAB IF THEY GET IN A HUFF BUT THERE ORTER BE WRITING 'BOUT
A BIG THING LIKE THIS
AND BLOOD
TOM'S WHOLE BEING APPLAUDED THIS IDEA
IT WAS DEEP AND DARK AND AWFUL
THE HOUR THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE SURROUNDINGS WERE IN KEEPING WITH IT
HE PICKED UP A CLEAN PINE SHINGLE THAT LAY IN THE MOON LIGHT TOOK A
LITTLE FRAGMENT OF RED KEEL OUT OF HIS POCKET GOT THE MOON ON
HIS WORK AND PAINFULLY SCRAWLED THESE LINES EMPHASIZING EACH SLOW
DOWN STROKE BY CLAMPING HIS TONGUE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND LETTING UP THE
PRESSURE ON THE UP STROKES
SEE NEXT PAGE
HUCK FINN AND TOM SAWYER SWEARS THEY WILL KEEP MUM ABOUT THIS AND THEY
WISH THEY MAY DROP DOWN DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS IF THEY EVER TELL AND ROT
HUCKLEBERRY WAS FILLED WITH ADMIRATION OF TOM'S FACILITY IN WRITING AND
THE SUBLIMITY OF HIS LANGUAGE
HE AT ONCE TOOK A PIN FROM HIS LAPEL AND
WAS GOING TO PRICK HIS FLESH BUT TOM SAID
HOLD ON DON'T DO THAT
A PIN'S BRASS
IT MIGHT HAVE VERDIGREASE ON
IT
WHAT'S VERDIGREASE
IT'S P'ISON
THAT'S WHAT IT IS
YOU JUST SWALLER SOME OF IT ONCE YOU'LL
SEE
SO TOM UNWOUND THE THREAD FROM ONE OF HIS NEEDLES AND EACH BOY PRICKED
THE BALL OF HIS THUMB AND SQUEEZED OUT A DROP OF BLOOD
IN TIME AFTER
MANY SQUEEZES TOM MANAGED TO SIGN HIS INITIALS USING THE BALL OF HIS
LITTLE FINGER FOR A PEN
THEN HE SHOWED HUCKLEBERRY HOW TO MAKE AN H AND
AN F AND THE OATH WAS COMPLETE
THEY BURIED THE SHINGLE CLOSE TO THE
WALL WITH SOME DISMAL CEREMONIES AND INCANTATIONS AND THE FETTERS
THAT BOUND THEIR TONGUES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE LOCKED AND THE KEY THROWN
AWAY
A FIGURE CREPT STEALTHILY THROUGH A BREAK IN THE OTHER END OF THE RUINED
BUILDING NOW BUT THEY DID NOT NOTICE IT
TOM WHISPERED HUCKLEBERRY DOES THIS KEEP US FROM EVER
TELLING ALWAYS
OF COURSE IT DOES
IT DON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT HAPPENS WE GOT
TO KEEP MUM

YES I RECKON THAT'S SO
THEY CONTINUED TO WHISPER FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
PRESENTLY A DOG SET UP
A LONG LUGUBRIOUS HOWL JUST OUTSIDE WITHIN TEN FEET OF THEM
THE BOYS
CLASPED EACH OTHER SUDDENLY IN AN AGONY OF FRIGHT
WHICH OF US DOES HE MEAN GASPED HUCKLEBERRY

SH WHAT'S THAT HE WHISPERED
SOUNDS LIKE LIKE HOGS GRUNTING

SOUNDS SO ANYWAY
PAP USED TO SLEEP
THERE SOMETIMES 'LONG WITH THE HOGS BUT LAWS BLESS YOU HE JUST LIFTS
THINGS WHEN HE SNORES
BESIDES I RECKON HE AIN'T EVER COMING BACK TO
THIS TOWN ANY MORE
THE SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE ROSE IN THE BOYS' SOULS ONCE MORE
HUCKY DO YOU DAS'T TO GO IF I LEAD
I DON'T LIKE TO MUCH
TOM S'POSE IT'S INJUN JOE
TOM QUAILED
BUT PRESENTLY THE TEMPTATION ROSE UP STRONG AGAIN AND THE
BOYS AGREED TO TRY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD TAKE TO THEIR
HEELS IF THE SNORING STOPPED
SO THEY WENT TIPTOEING STEALTHILY DOWN
THE ONE BEHIND THE OTHER
WHEN THEY HAD GOT TO WITHIN FIVE STEPS OF THE
SNORER TOM STEPPED ON A STICK AND IT BROKE WITH A SHARP SNAP
THE MAN
MOANED WRITHED A LITTLE AND HIS FACE CAME INTO THE MOONLIGHT
IT WAS
MUFF POTTER
THE BOYS' HEARTS HAD STOOD STILL AND THEIR HOPES TOO
WHEN THE MAN MOVED BUT THEIR FEARS PASSED AWAY NOW
THEY TIP TOED OUT
THROUGH THE BROKEN WEATHER BOARDING AND STOPPED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE
TO EXCHANGE A PARTING WORD
THAT LONG LUGUBRIOUS HOWL ROSE ON THE NIGHT
AIR AGAIN THEY TURNED AND SAW THE STRANGE DOG STANDING WITHIN A FEW
FEET OF WHERE POTTER WAS LYING AND FACING POTTER WITH HIS NOSE
POINTING HEAVENWARD
OH GEEMINY IT'S HIM EXCLAIMED BOTH BOYS IN A BREATH
SAY TOM THEY SAY A STRAY DOG COME HOWLING AROUND JOHNNY MILLER'S
HOUSE 'BOUT MIDNIGHT AS MUCH AS TWO WEEKS AGO AND A WHIPPOORWILL COME
IN AND LIT ON THE BANISTERS AND SUNG THE VERY SAME EVENING AND THERE
AIN'T ANYBODY DEAD THERE YET
WELL I KNOW THAT
AND SUPPOSE THERE AIN'T
DIDN'T GRACIE MILLER FALL
IN THE KITCHEN FIRE AND BURN HERSELF TERRIBLE THE VERY NEXT SATURDAY
YES BUT SHE AIN'T DEAD
AND WHAT'S MORE SHE'S GETTING BETTER TOO
ALL RIGHT YOU WAIT AND SEE
SHE'S A GONER JUST AS DEAD SURE AS MUFF
POTTER'S A GONER
THAT'S WHAT THE NIGGERS SAY AND THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT
THESE KIND OF THINGS HUCK
THEN THEY SEPARATED COGITATING
WHEN TOM CREPT IN AT HIS BEDROOM WINDOW
THE NIGHT WAS ALMOST SPENT
HE UNDRESSED WITH EXCESSIVE CAUTION AND
FELL ASLEEP CONGRATULATING HIMSELF THAT NOBODY KNEW OF HIS ESCAPADE
HE
WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE GENTLY SNORING SID WAS AWAKE AND HAD BEEN SO FOR
AN HOUR
WHEN TOM AWOKE SID WAS DRESSED AND GONE
THERE WAS A LATE LOOK IN THE
LIGHT A LATE SENSE IN THE ATMOSPHERE
HE WAS STARTLED
WHY HAD HE NOT
BEEN CALLED PERSECUTED TILL HE WAS UP AS USUAL THE THOUGHT FILLED
HIM WITH BODINGS
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES HE WAS DRESSED AND DOWN STAIRS
FEELING SORE AND DROWSY
THE FAMILY WERE STILL AT TABLE BUT THEY HAD
FINISHED BREAKFAST
THERE WAS NO VOICE OF REBUKE BUT THERE WERE AVERTED
EYES THERE WAS A SILENCE AND AN AIR OF SOLEMNITY THAT STRUCK A CHILL
TO THE CULPRIT'S HEART
HE SAT DOWN AND TRIED TO SEEM GAY BUT IT
WAS UP HILL WORK IT ROUSED NO SMILE NO RESPONSE AND HE LAPSED INTO
SILENCE AND LET HIS HEART SINK DOWN TO THE DEPTHS
AFTER BREAKFAST HIS AUNT TOOK HIM ASIDE AND TOM ALMOST BRIGHTENED IN
THE HOPE THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE FLOGGED BUT IT WAS NOT SO
HIS AUNT
WEPT OVER HIM AND ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD GO AND BREAK HER OLD HEART SO
AND FINALLY TOLD HIM TO GO ON AND RUIN HIMSELF AND BRING HER GRAY HAIRS
WITH SORROW TO THE GRAVE FOR IT WAS NO USE FOR HER TO TRY ANY MORE
THIS WAS WORSE THAN A THOUSAND WHIPPINGS AND TOM'S HEART WAS SORER NOW
THAN HIS BODY
HE CRIED HE PLEADED FOR FORGIVENESS PROMISED TO REFORM
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THEN RECEIVED HIS DISMISSAL FEELING THAT
HE HAD WON BUT AN IMPERFECT FORGIVENESS AND ESTABLISHED BUT A FEEBLE
CONFIDENCE
HE LEFT THE PRESENCE TOO MISERABLE TO EVEN FEEL REVENGEFUL TOWARD
SID AND SO THE LATTER'S PROMPT RETREAT THROUGH THE BACK GATE WAS
UNNECESSARY
HE MOPED TO SCHOOL GLOOMY AND SAD AND TOOK HIS FLOGGING
ALONG WITH JOE HARPER FOR PLAYING HOOKEY THE DAY BEFORE WITH THE
AIR OF ONE WHOSE HEART WAS BUSY WITH HEAVIER WOES AND WHOLLY DEAD TO
TRIFLES
THEN HE BETOOK HIMSELF TO HIS SEAT RESTED HIS ELBOWS ON HIS
DESK AND HIS JAWS IN HIS HANDS AND STARED AT THE WALL WITH THE STONY
STARE OF SUFFERING THAT HAS REACHED THE LIMIT AND CAN NO FURTHER GO
HIS ELBOW WAS PRESSING AGAINST SOME HARD SUBSTANCE
AFTER A LONG TIME
HE SLOWLY AND SADLY CHANGED HIS POSITION AND TOOK UP THIS OBJECT WITH
A SIGH
IT WAS IN A PAPER
HE UNROLLED IT
A LONG LINGERING COLOSSAL
SIGH FOLLOWED AND HIS HEART BROKE
IT WAS HIS BRASS ANDIRON KNOB
THIS FINAL FEATHER BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK
CHAPTER XI
CLOSE UPON THE HOUR OF NOON THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS SUDDENLY ELECTRIFIED
WITH THE GHASTLY NEWS
NO NEED OF THE AS YET UN DREAMED OF TELEGRAPH
THE TALE FLEW FROM MAN TO MAN FROM GROUP TO GROUP FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE
WITH LITTLE LESS THAN TELEGRAPHIC SPEED
OF COURSE THE SCHOOLMASTER GAVE
HOLI DAY FOR THAT AFTERNOON THE TOWN WOULD HAVE THOUGHT STRANGELY OF
HIM IF HE HAD NOT
A GORY KNIFE HAD BEEN FOUND CLOSE TO THE MURDERED MAN AND IT HAD BEEN
RECOGNIZED BY SOMEBODY AS BELONGING TO MUFF POTTER SO THE STORY RAN
AND
IT WAS SAID THAT A BELATED CITIZEN HAD COME UPON POTTER WASHING HIMSELF
IN THE BRANCH ABOUT ONE OR TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND THAT POTTER
HAD AT ONCE SNEAKED OFF SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES ESPECIALLY THE WASHING
WHICH WAS NOT A HABIT WITH POTTER
IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT THE TOWN HAD
BEEN RANSACKED FOR THIS MURDERER THE PUBLIC ARE NOT SLOW IN THE
MATTER OF SIFTING EVIDENCE AND ARRIVING AT A VERDICT BUT THAT HE
COULD NOT BE FOUND
HORSEMEN HAD DEPARTED DOWN ALL THE ROADS IN EVERY
DIRECTION AND THE SHERIFF WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD BE CAPTURED
BEFORE NIGHT
ALL THE TOWN WAS DRIFTING TOWARD THE GRAVEYARD
TOM'S HEARTBREAK
VANISHED AND HE JOINED THE PROCESSION NOT BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT
A THOUSAND TIMES RATHER GO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT BECAUSE AN AWFUL
UNACCOUNTABLE FASCINATION DREW HIM ON
ARRIVED AT THE DREADFUL PLACE HE
WORMED HIS SMALL BODY THROUGH THE CROWD AND SAW THE DISMAL SPECTACLE
IT SEEMED TO HIM AN AGE SINCE HE WAS THERE BEFORE
SOMEBODY PINCHED
HIS ARM
HE TURNED AND HIS EYES MET HUCKLEBERRY'S
THEN BOTH LOOKED
ELSEWHERE AT ONCE AND WONDERED IF ANYBODY HAD NOTICED ANYTHING IN THEIR
MUTUAL GLANCE
BUT EVERYBODY WAS TALKING AND INTENT UPON THE GRISLY
SPECTACLE BEFORE THEM
POOR FELLOW POOR YOUNG FELLOW THIS OUGHT TO BE A LESSON TO GRAVE
ROBBERS MUFF POTTER'LL HANG FOR THIS IF THEY CATCH HIM THIS WAS THE
DRIFT OF REMARK AND THE MINISTER SAID IT WAS A JUDGMENT HIS HAND IS
HERE
NOW TOM SHIVERED FROM HEAD TO HEEL FOR HIS EYE FELL UPON THE STOLID
FACE OF INJUN JOE
AT THIS MOMENT THE CROWD BEGAN TO SWAY AND STRUGGLE
AND VOICES SHOUTED IT'S HIM IT'S HIM HE'S COMING HIMSELF
WHO WHO FROM TWENTY VOICES
MUFF POTTER
HALLO HE'S STOPPED LOOK OUT HE'S TURNING DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY
PEOPLE IN THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES OVER TOM'S HEAD SAID HE WASN'T
TRYING TO GET AWAY HE ONLY LOOKED DOUBTFUL AND PERPLEXED
INFERNAL IMPUDENCE SAID A BYSTANDER WANTED TO COME AND TAKE A QUIET
LOOK AT HIS WORK I RECKON DIDN'T EXPECT ANY COMPANY
THE CROWD FELL APART NOW AND THE SHERIFF CAME THROUGH OSTENTATIOUSLY
LEADING POTTER BY THE ARM
THE POOR FELLOW'S FACE WAS HAGGARD AND
HIS EYES SHOWED THE FEAR THAT WAS UPON HIM
WHEN HE STOOD BEFORE THE
MURDERED MAN HE SHOOK AS WITH A PALSY AND HE PUT HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
AND BURST INTO TEARS
I DIDN'T DO IT FRIENDS HE SOBBED 'PON MY WORD AND HONOR I NEVER
DONE IT
WHO'S ACCUSED YOU SHOUTED A VOICE
THIS SHOT SEEMED TO CARRY HOME
POTTER LIFTED HIS FACE AND LOOKED AROUND
HIM WITH A PATHETIC HOPELESSNESS IN HIS EYES
HE SAW INJUN JOE AND
EXCLAIMED
OH INJUN JOE YOU PROMISED ME YOU'D NEVER
IS THAT YOUR KNIFE AND IT WAS THRUST BEFORE HIM BY THE SHERIFF
POTTER WOULD HAVE FALLEN IF THEY HAD NOT CAUGHT HIM AND EASED HIM TO THE
GROUND
THEN HE SAID
SOMETHING TOLD ME 'T IF I DIDN'T COME BACK AND GET HE SHUDDERED THEN
WAVED HIS NERVELESS HAND WITH A VANQUISHED GESTURE AND SAID TELL 'EM
JOE TELL 'EM IT AIN'T ANY USE ANY MORE
THEN HUCKLEBERRY AND TOM STOOD DUMB AND STARING AND HEARD THE
STONY HEARTED LIAR REEL OFF HIS SERENE STATEMENT THEY EXPECTING EVERY
MOMENT THAT THE CLEAR SKY WOULD DELIVER GOD'S LIGHTNINGS UPON HIS HEAD
AND WONDERING TO SEE HOW LONG THE STROKE WAS DELAYED
AND WHEN HE HAD
FINISHED AND STILL STOOD ALIVE AND WHOLE THEIR WAVERING IMPULSE TO
BREAK THEIR OATH AND SAVE THE POOR BETRAYED PRISONER'S LIFE FADED AND
VANISHED AWAY FOR PLAINLY THIS MISCREANT HAD SOLD HIMSELF TO SATAN AND
IT WOULD BE FATAL TO MEDDLE WITH THE PROPERTY OF SUCH A POWER AS THAT
WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAVE WHAT DID YOU WANT TO COME HERE FOR SOMEBODY
SAID
I COULDN'T HELP IT I COULDN'T HELP IT POTTER MOANED
I WANTED TO
RUN AWAY BUT I COULDN'T SEEM TO COME ANYWHERE BUT HERE AND HE FELL TO
SOBBING AGAIN
INJUN JOE REPEATED HIS STATEMENT JUST AS CALMLY A FEW MINUTES
AFTERWARD ON THE INQUEST UNDER OATH AND THE BOYS SEEING THAT THE
LIGHTNINGS WERE STILL WITHHELD WERE CONFIRMED IN THEIR BELIEF THAT
JOE HAD SOLD HIMSELF TO THE DEVIL
HE WAS NOW BECOME TO THEM THE MOST
BALEFULLY INTERESTING OBJECT THEY HAD EVER LOOKED UPON AND THEY COULD
NOT TAKE THEIR FASCINATED EYES FROM HIS FACE
THEY INWARDLY RESOLVED TO WATCH HIM NIGHTS WHEN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD
OFFER IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A GLIMPSE OF HIS DREAD MASTER
INJUN JOE HELPED TO RAISE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED MAN AND PUT IT IN
A WAGON FOR REMOVAL AND IT WAS WHISPERED THROUGH THE SHUDDERING
CROWD THAT THE WOUND BLED A LITTLE THE BOYS THOUGHT THAT THIS HAPPY
CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD TURN SUSPICION IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THEY WERE
DISAPPOINTED FOR MORE THAN ONE VILLAGER REMARKED
IT WAS WITHIN THREE FEET OF MUFF POTTER WHEN IT DONE IT
TOM'S FEARFUL SECRET AND GNAWING CONSCIENCE DISTURBED HIS SLEEP FOR AS
MUCH AS A WEEK AFTER THIS AND AT BREAKFAST ONE MORNING SID SAID
TOM YOU PITCH AROUND AND TALK IN YOUR SLEEP SO MUCH THAT YOU KEEP ME
AWAKE HALF THE TIME
TOM BLANCHED AND DROPPED HIS EYES
IT'S A BAD SIGN SAID AUNT POLLY GRAVELY
WHAT YOU GOT ON YOUR MIND
TOM
NOTHING
NOTHING 'T I KNOW OF BUT THE BOY'S HAND SHOOK SO THAT HE
SPILLED HIS COFFEE
AND YOU DO TALK SUCH STUFF SID SAID
LAST NIGHT YOU SAID 'IT'S
BLOOD IT'S BLOOD THAT'S WHAT IT IS YOU SAID THAT OVER AND OVER
AND YOU SAID 'DON'T TORMENT ME SO I'LL TELL TELL WHAT WHAT IS IT
YOU'LL TELL
EVERYTHING WAS SWIMMING BEFORE TOM
THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT MIGHT HAVE
HAPPENED NOW BUT LUCKILY THE CONCERN PASSED OUT OF AUNT POLLY'S FACE
AND SHE CAME TO TOM'S RELIEF WITHOUT KNOWING IT
SHE SAID
SHO IT'S THAT DREADFUL MURDER
I DREAM ABOUT IT MOST EVERY NIGHT
MYSELF
SOMETIMES I DREAM IT'S ME THAT DONE IT
MARY SAID SHE HAD BEEN AFFECTED MUCH THE SAME WAY
SID SEEMED SATISFIED
TOM GOT OUT OF THE PRESENCE AS QUICK AS HE PLAUSIBLY COULD AND AFTER
THAT HE COMPLAINED OF TOOTHACHE FOR A WEEK AND TIED UP HIS JAWS EVERY
NIGHT
HE NEVER KNEW THAT SID LAY NIGHTLY WATCHING AND FREQUENTLY
SLIPPED THE BANDAGE FREE AND THEN LEANED ON HIS ELBOW LISTENING A GOOD
WHILE AT A TIME AND AFTERWARD SLIPPED THE BANDAGE BACK TO ITS PLACE
AGAIN
TOM'S DISTRESS OF MIND WORE OFF GRADUALLY AND THE TOOTHACHE GREW
IRKSOME AND WAS DISCARDED
IF SID REALLY MANAGED TO MAKE ANYTHING OUT OF
TOM'S DISJOINTED MUTTERINGS HE KEPT IT TO HIMSELF
IT SEEMED TO TOM THAT HIS SCHOOLMATES NEVER WOULD GET DONE HOLDING
INQUESTS ON DEAD CATS AND THUS KEEPING HIS TROUBLE PRESENT TO HIS MIND
SID NOTICED THAT TOM NEVER WAS CORONER AT ONE OF THESE INQUIRIES
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN HIS HABIT TO TAKE THE LEAD IN ALL NEW ENTERPRISES
HE NOTICED TOO THAT TOM NEVER ACTED AS A WITNESS AND THAT WAS STRANGE
AND SID DID NOT OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT TOM EVEN SHOWED A MARKED AVERSION
TO THESE INQUESTS AND ALWAYS AVOIDED THEM WHEN HE COULD
SID MARVELLED
BUT SAID NOTHING
HOWEVER EVEN INQUESTS WENT OUT OF VOGUE AT LAST AND
CEASED TO TORTURE TOM'S CONSCIENCE
EVERY DAY OR TWO DURING THIS TIME OF SORROW TOM WATCHED HIS
OPPORTUNITY AND WENT TO THE LITTLE GRATED JAIL WINDOW AND SMUGGLED SUCH
SMALL COMFORTS THROUGH TO THE MURDERER AS HE COULD GET HOLD OF
THE
JAIL WAS A TRIFLING LITTLE BRICK DEN THAT STOOD IN A MARSH AT THE EDGE
OF THE VILLAGE AND NO GUARDS WERE AFFORDED FOR IT INDEED IT
WAS SELDOM OCCUPIED
THESE OFFERINGS GREATLY HELPED TO EASE TOM'S
CONSCIENCE
THE VILLAGERS HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO TAR AND FEATHER INJUN JOE AND RIDE
HIM ON A RAIL FOR BODY SNATCHING BUT SO FORMIDABLE WAS HIS CHARACTER
THAT NOBODY COULD BE FOUND WHO WAS WILLING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THE
MATTER SO IT WAS DROPPED
HE HAD BEEN CAREFUL TO BEGIN BOTH OF HIS
INQUEST STATEMENTS WITH THE FIGHT WITHOUT CONFESSING THE GRAVE ROBBERY
THAT PRECEDED IT THEREFORE IT WAS DEEMED WISEST NOT TO TRY THE CASE IN
THE COURTS AT PRESENT
CHAPTER XII
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY TOM'S MIND HAD DRIFTED AWAY FROM ITS SECRET
TROUBLES WAS THAT IT HAD FOUND A NEW AND WEIGHTY MATTER TO INTEREST
ITSELF ABOUT
BECKY THATCHER HAD STOPPED COMING TO SCHOOL
TOM HAD
STRUGGLED WITH HIS PRIDE A FEW DAYS AND TRIED TO WHISTLE HER DOWN THE
WIND BUT FAILED
HE BEGAN TO FIND HIMSELF HANGING AROUND HER FATHER'S
HOUSE NIGHTS AND FEELING VERY MISERABLE
SHE WAS ILL
WHAT IF SHE
SHOULD DIE THERE WAS DISTRACTION IN THE THOUGHT
HE NO LONGER TOOK AN
INTEREST IN WAR NOR EVEN IN PIRACY
THE CHARM OF LIFE WAS GONE THERE
WAS NOTHING BUT DREARINESS LEFT
HE PUT HIS HOOP AWAY AND HIS BAT
THERE WAS NO JOY IN THEM ANY MORE
HIS AUNT WAS CONCERNED
SHE BEGAN TO
TRY ALL MANNER OF REMEDIES ON HIM
SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO
ARE INFATUATED WITH PATENT MEDICINES AND ALL NEW FANGLED METHODS OF
PRODUCING HEALTH OR MENDING IT
SHE WAS AN INVETERATE EXPERIMENTER IN
THESE THINGS
WHEN SOMETHING FRESH IN THIS LINE CAME OUT SHE WAS IN A
FEVER RIGHT AWAY TO TRY IT NOT ON HERSELF FOR SHE WAS NEVER AILING
BUT ON ANYBODY ELSE THAT CAME HANDY
SHE WAS A SUBSCRIBER FOR ALL THE
HEALTH PERIODICALS AND PHRENOLOGICAL FRAUDS AND THE SOLEMN IGNORANCE
THEY WERE INFLATED WITH WAS BREATH TO HER NOSTRILS
ALL THE ROT THEY
CONTAINED ABOUT VENTILATION AND HOW TO GO TO BED AND HOW TO GET UP
AND WHAT TO EAT AND WHAT TO DRINK AND HOW MUCH EXERCISE TO TAKE AND
WHAT FRAME OF MIND TO KEEP ONE'S SELF IN AND WHAT SORT OF CLOTHING
TO WEAR WAS ALL GOSPEL TO HER AND SHE NEVER OBSERVED THAT HER
HEALTH JOURNALS OF THE CURRENT MONTH CUSTOMARILY UPSET EVERYTHING THEY
HAD RECOMMENDED THE MONTH BEFORE
SHE WAS AS SIMPLE HEARTED AND HONEST
AS THE DAY WAS LONG AND SO SHE WAS AN EASY VICTIM
SHE GATHERED
TOGETHER HER QUACK PERIODICALS AND HER QUACK MEDICINES AND THUS ARMED
WITH DEATH WENT ABOUT ON HER PALE HORSE METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING WITH
HELL FOLLOWING AFTER BUT SHE NEVER SUSPECTED THAT SHE WAS NOT AN
ANGEL OF HEALING AND THE BALM OF GILEAD IN DISGUISE TO THE SUFFERING
NEIGHBORS
THE WATER TREATMENT WAS NEW NOW AND TOM'S LOW CONDITION WAS A WINDFALL
TO HER
SHE HAD HIM OUT AT DAYLIGHT EVERY MORNING STOOD HIM UP IN THE
WOOD SHED AND DROWNED HIM WITH A DELUGE OF COLD WATER THEN SHE SCRUBBED
HIM DOWN WITH A TOWEL LIKE A FILE AND SO BROUGHT HIM TO THEN SHE
ROLLED HIM UP IN A WET SHEET AND PUT HIM AWAY UNDER BLANKETS TILL SHE
SWEATED HIS SOUL CLEAN AND THE YELLOW STAINS OF IT CAME THROUGH HIS
PORES AS TOM SAID
YET NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THIS THE BOY GREW MORE AND MORE MELANCHOLY AND
PALE AND DEJECTED
SHE ADDED HOT BATHS SITZ BATHS SHOWER BATHS AND
PLUNGES
THE BOY REMAINED AS DISMAL AS A HEARSE
SHE BEGAN TO ASSIST THE
WATER WITH A SLIM OATMEAL DIET AND BLISTER PLASTERS
SHE CALCULATED HIS
CAPACITY AS SHE WOULD A JUG'S AND FILLED HIM UP EVERY DAY WITH QUACK
CURE ALLS
TOM HAD BECOME INDIFFERENT TO PERSECUTION BY THIS TIME
THIS PHASE
FILLED THE OLD LADY'S HEART WITH CONSTERNATION
THIS INDIFFERENCE MUST
BE BROKEN UP AT ANY COST
NOW SHE HEARD OF PAIN KILLER FOR THE FIRST
TIME
SHE ORDERED A LOT AT ONCE
SHE TASTED IT AND WAS FILLED WITH
GRATITUDE
IT WAS SIMPLY FIRE IN A LIQUID FORM
SHE DROPPED THE WATER
TREATMENT AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND PINNED HER FAITH TO PAIN KILLER
SHE GAVE TOM A TEASPOONFUL AND WATCHED WITH THE DEEPEST ANXIETY FOR THE
RESULT
HER TROUBLES WERE INSTANTLY AT REST HER SOUL AT PEACE AGAIN
FOR THE INDIFFERENCE WAS BROKEN UP
THE BOY COULD NOT HAVE SHOWN A
WILDER HEARTIER INTEREST IF SHE HAD BUILT A FIRE UNDER HIM
TOM FELT THAT IT WAS TIME TO WAKE UP THIS SORT OF LIFE MIGHT BE
ROMANTIC ENOUGH IN HIS BLIGHTED CONDITION BUT IT WAS GETTING TO HAVE
TOO LITTLE SENTIMENT AND TOO MUCH DISTRACTING VARIETY ABOUT IT
SO HE
THOUGHT OVER VARIOUS PLANS FOR RELIEF AND FINALLY HIT UPON THAT OF
PROFESSING TO BE FOND OF PAIN KILLER
HE ASKED FOR IT SO OFTEN THAT HE
BECAME A NUISANCE AND HIS AUNT ENDED BY TELLING HIM TO HELP HIMSELF AND
QUIT BOTHERING HER
IF IT HAD BEEN SID SHE WOULD HAVE HAD NO MISGIVINGS
TO ALLOY HER DELIGHT BUT SINCE IT WAS TOM SHE WATCHED THE BOTTLE
CLANDESTINELY
SHE FOUND THAT THE MEDICINE DID REALLY DIMINISH BUT IT
DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT THE BOY WAS MENDING THE HEALTH OF A CRACK IN
THE SITTING ROOM FLOOR WITH IT
ONE DAY TOM WAS IN THE ACT OF DOSING THE CRACK WHEN HIS AUNT'S YELLOW
CAT CAME ALONG PURRING EYEING THE TEASPOON AVARICIOUSLY AND BEGGING
FOR A TASTE
TOM SAID
DON'T ASK FOR IT UNLESS YOU WANT IT PETER
BUT PETER SIGNIFIED THAT HE DID WANT IT
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
PETER WAS SURE
NOW YOU'VE ASKED FOR IT AND I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU BECAUSE THERE AIN'T
ANYTHING MEAN ABOUT ME BUT IF YOU FIND YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU MUSTN'T
BLAME ANYBODY BUT YOUR OWN SELF
PETER WAS AGREEABLE
SO TOM PRIED HIS MOUTH OPEN AND POURED DOWN
THE PAIN KILLER
PETER SPRANG A COUPLE OF YARDS IN THE AIR AND THEN
DELIVERED A WAR WHOOP AND SET OFF ROUND AND ROUND THE ROOM BANGING
AGAINST FURNITURE UPSETTING FLOWER POTS AND MAKING GENERAL HAVOC
NEXT
HE ROSE ON HIS HIND FEET AND PRANCED AROUND IN A FRENZY OF ENJOYMENT
WITH HIS HEAD OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS VOICE PROCLAIMING HIS
UNAPPEASABLE HAPPINESS
THEN HE WENT TEARING AROUND THE HOUSE AGAIN
SPREADING CHAOS AND DESTRUCTION IN HIS PATH
AUNT POLLY ENTERED IN TIME
TO SEE HIM THROW A FEW DOUBLE SUMMERSETS DELIVER A FINAL MIGHTY HURRAH
AND SAIL THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW CARRYING THE REST OF THE FLOWER POTS
WITH HIM
THE OLD LADY STOOD PETRIFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT PEERING OVER
HER GLASSES TOM LAY ON THE FLOOR EXPIRING WITH LAUGHTER
TOM WHAT ON EARTH AILS THAT CAT
I DON'T KNOW AUNT GASPED THE BOY
WHY I NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT
WHAT DID MAKE HIM ACT SO
DEED I DON'T KNOW AUNT POLLY CATS ALWAYS ACT SO WHEN THEY'RE HAVING A
GOOD TIME
THEY DO DO THEY THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE TONE THAT MADE TOM
APPREHENSIVE
YES'M
THAT IS I BELIEVE THEY DO
YOU DO
YES'M
THE OLD LADY WAS BENDING DOWN TOM WATCHING WITH INTEREST EMPHASIZED
BY ANXIETY
TOO LATE HE DIVINED HER DRIFT THE HANDLE OF THE TELLTALE
TEA SPOON WAS VISIBLE UNDER THE BED VALANCE
AUNT POLLY TOOK IT HELD IT
UP
TOM WINCED AND DROPPED HIS EYES
AUNT POLLY RAISED HIM BY THE USUAL
HANDLE HIS EAR AND CRACKED HIS HEAD SOUNDLY WITH HER THIMBLE
NOW SIR WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TREAT THAT POOR DUMB BEAST SO FOR
I DONE IT OUT OF PITY FOR HIM BECAUSE HE HADN'T ANY AUNT
HADN'T ANY AUNT YOU NUMSKULL
WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT
HEAPS
BECAUSE IF HE'D HAD ONE SHE'D A BURNT HIM OUT HERSELF SHE'D A
ROASTED HIS BOWELS OUT OF HIM 'THOUT ANY MORE FEELING THAN IF HE WAS A
HUMAN
AUNT POLLY FELT A SUDDEN PANG OF REMORSE
THIS WAS PUTTING THE THING IN
A NEW LIGHT WHAT WAS CRUELTY TO A CAT MIGHT BE CRUELTY TO A BOY TOO
SHE BEGAN TO SOFTEN SHE FELT SORRY
HER EYES WATERED A LITTLE AND SHE
PUT HER HAND ON TOM'S HEAD AND SAID GENTLY
I WAS MEANING FOR THE BEST TOM
AND TOM IT DID DO YOU GOOD
TOM LOOKED UP IN HER FACE WITH JUST A PERCEPTIBLE TWINKLE PEEPING
THROUGH HIS GRAVITY
I KNOW YOU WAS MEANING FOR THE BEST AUNTY AND SO WAS I WITH PETER
IT
DONE HIM GOOD TOO
I NEVER SEE HIM GET AROUND SO SINCE
OH GO 'LONG WITH YOU TOM BEFORE YOU AGGRAVATE ME AGAIN
AND YOU TRY
AND SEE IF YOU CAN'T BE A GOOD BOY FOR ONCE AND YOU NEEDN'T TAKE ANY
MORE MEDICINE
TOM REACHED SCHOOL AHEAD OF TIME
IT WAS NOTICED THAT THIS STRANGE THING
HAD BEEN OCCURRING EVERY DAY LATTERLY
AND NOW AS USUAL OF LATE
HE HUNG ABOUT THE GATE OF THE SCHOOLYARD INSTEAD OF PLAYING WITH HIS
COMRADES
HE WAS SICK HE SAID AND HE LOOKED IT
HE TRIED TO SEEM TO
BE LOOKING EVERYWHERE BUT WHITHER HE REALLY WAS LOOKING DOWN THE ROAD
PRESENTLY JEFF THATCHER HOVE IN SIGHT AND TOM'S FACE LIGHTED HE GAZED
A MOMENT AND THEN TURNED SORROWFULLY AWAY
WHEN JEFF ARRIVED TOM
ACCOSTED HIM AND LED UP WARILY TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR REMARK ABOUT
BECKY BUT THE GIDDY LAD NEVER COULD SEE THE BAIT
TOM WATCHED AND
WATCHED HOPING WHENEVER A FRISKING FROCK CAME IN SIGHT AND HATING THE
OWNER OF IT AS SOON AS HE SAW SHE WAS NOT THE RIGHT ONE
AT LAST FROCKS
CEASED TO APPEAR AND HE DROPPED HOPELESSLY INTO THE DUMPS HE ENTERED
THE EMPTY SCHOOLHOUSE AND SAT DOWN TO SUFFER
THEN ONE MORE FROCK PASSED
IN AT THE GATE AND TOM'S HEART GAVE A GREAT BOUND
THE NEXT INSTANT HE
WAS OUT AND GOING ON LIKE AN INDIAN YELLING LAUGHING CHASING BOYS
JUMPING OVER THE FENCE AT RISK OF LIFE AND LIMB THROWING HANDSPRINGS
STANDING ON HIS HEAD DOING ALL THE HEROIC THINGS HE COULD CONCEIVE OF
AND KEEPING A FURTIVE EYE OUT ALL THE WHILE TO SEE IF BECKY THATCHER
WAS NOTICING
BUT SHE SEEMED TO BE UNCONSCIOUS OF IT ALL SHE NEVER
LOOKED
COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE WAS NOT AWARE THAT HE WAS THERE
HE CARRIED HIS EXPLOITS TO HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY CAME WAR WHOOPING
AROUND SNATCHED A BOY'S CAP HURLED IT TO THE ROOF OF THE SCHOOLHOUSE
BROKE THROUGH A GROUP OF BOYS TUMBLING THEM IN EVERY DIRECTION AND
FELL SPRAWLING HIMSELF UNDER BECKY'S NOSE ALMOST UPSETTING HER AND
SHE TURNED WITH HER NOSE IN THE AIR AND HE HEARD HER SAY MF SOME
PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE MIGHTY SMART ALWAYS SHOWING OFF
TOM'S CHEEKS BURNED
HE GATHERED HIMSELF UP AND SNEAKED OFF CRUSHED AND
CRESTFALLEN
CHAPTER XIII
TOM'S MIND WAS MADE UP NOW
HE WAS GLOOMY AND DESPERATE
HE WAS A
FORSAKEN FRIENDLESS BOY HE SAID NOBODY LOVED HIM WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
WHAT THEY HAD DRIVEN HIM TO PERHAPS THEY WOULD BE SORRY HE HAD TRIED
TO DO RIGHT AND GET ALONG BUT THEY WOULD NOT LET HIM SINCE NOTHING
WOULD DO THEM BUT TO BE RID OF HIM LET IT BE SO AND LET THEM BLAME
HIM FOR THE CONSEQUENCES WHY SHOULDN'T THEY WHAT RIGHT HAD THE
FRIENDLESS TO COMPLAIN YES THEY HAD FORCED HIM TO IT AT LAST HE WOULD
LEAD A LIFE OF CRIME
THERE WAS NO CHOICE
BY THIS TIME HE WAS FAR DOWN MEADOW LANE AND THE BELL FOR SCHOOL TO
TAKE UP TINKLED FAINTLY UPON HIS EAR
HE SOBBED NOW TO THINK HE
SHOULD NEVER NEVER HEAR THAT OLD FAMILIAR SOUND ANY MORE IT WAS VERY
HARD BUT IT WAS FORCED ON HIM SINCE HE WAS DRIVEN OUT INTO THE COLD
WORLD HE MUST SUBMIT BUT HE FORGAVE THEM
THEN THE SOBS CAME THICK AND
FAST
JUST AT THIS POINT HE MET HIS SOUL'S SWORN COMRADE JOE
HARPER HARD EYED AND WITH EVIDENTLY A GREAT AND DISMAL PURPOSE IN HIS
HEART
PLAINLY HERE WERE TWO SOULS WITH BUT A SINGLE THOUGHT TOM
WIPING HIS EYES WITH HIS SLEEVE BEGAN TO BLUBBER OUT SOMETHING ABOUT
A RESOLUTION TO ESCAPE FROM HARD USAGE AND LACK OF SYMPATHY AT HOME BY
ROAMING ABROAD INTO THE GREAT WORLD NEVER TO RETURN AND ENDED BY HOPING
THAT JOE WOULD NOT FORGET HIM
BUT IT TRANSPIRED THAT THIS WAS A REQUEST WHICH JOE HAD JUST BEEN GOING
TO MAKE OF TOM AND HAD COME TO HUNT HIM UP FOR THAT PURPOSE
HIS MOTHER
HAD WHIPPED HIM FOR DRINKING SOME CREAM WHICH HE HAD NEVER TASTED AND
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE WAS TIRED OF HIM AND WISHED
HIM TO GO IF SHE FELT THAT WAY THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO BUT
SUCCUMB HE HOPED SHE WOULD BE HAPPY AND NEVER REGRET HAVING DRIVEN HER
POOR BOY OUT INTO THE UNFEELING WORLD TO SUFFER AND DIE
AS THE TWO BOYS WALKED SORROWING ALONG THEY MADE A NEW COMPACT TO STAND
BY EACH OTHER AND BE BROTHERS AND NEVER SEPARATE TILL DEATH RELIEVED
THEM OF THEIR TROUBLES
THEN THEY BEGAN TO LAY THEIR PLANS
JOE WAS FOR
BEING A HERMIT AND LIVING ON CRUSTS IN A REMOTE CAVE AND DYING
SOME TIME OF COLD AND WANT AND GRIEF BUT AFTER LISTENING TO TOM HE
CONCEDED THAT THERE WERE SOME CONSPICUOUS ADVANTAGES ABOUT A LIFE OF
CRIME AND SO HE CONSENTED TO BE A PIRATE
THREE MILES BELOW ST
PETERSBURG AT A POINT WHERE THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
WAS A TRIFLE OVER A MILE WIDE THERE WAS A LONG NARROW WOODED ISLAND
WITH A SHALLOW BAR AT THE HEAD OF IT AND THIS OFFERED WELL AS A
RENDEZVOUS
IT WAS NOT INHABITED IT LAY FAR OVER TOWARD THE FURTHER
SHORE ABREAST A DENSE AND ALMOST WHOLLY UNPEOPLED FOREST
SO JACKSON'S
ISLAND WAS CHOSEN
WHO WERE TO BE THE SUBJECTS OF THEIR PIRACIES WAS A
MATTER THAT DID NOT OCCUR TO THEM
THEN THEY HUNTED UP HUCKLEBERRY FINN
AND HE JOINED THEM PROMPTLY FOR ALL CAREERS WERE ONE TO HIM HE WAS
INDIFFERENT
THEY PRESENTLY SEPARATED TO MEET AT A LONELY SPOT ON THE
RIVER BANK TWO MILES ABOVE THE VILLAGE AT THE FAVORITE HOUR WHICH WAS
MIDNIGHT
THERE WAS A SMALL LOG RAFT THERE WHICH THEY MEANT TO CAPTURE
EACH WOULD BRING HOOKS AND LINES AND SUCH PROVISION AS HE COULD STEAL
IN THE MOST DARK AND MYSTERIOUS WAY AS BECAME OUTLAWS
AND BEFORE THE
AFTERNOON WAS DONE THEY HAD ALL MANAGED TO ENJOY THE SWEET GLORY OF
SPREADING THE FACT THAT PRETTY SOON THE TOWN WOULD HEAR SOMETHING ALL
WHO GOT THIS VAGUE HINT WERE CAUTIONED TO BE MUM AND WAIT
ABOUT MIDNIGHT TOM ARRIVED WITH A BOILED HAM AND A FEW TRIFLES
AND STOPPED IN A DENSE UNDERGROWTH ON A SMALL BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE
MEETING PLACE
IT WAS STARLIGHT AND VERY STILL
THE MIGHTY RIVER LAY
LIKE AN OCEAN AT REST
TOM LISTENED A MOMENT BUT NO SOUND DISTURBED THE
QUIET
THEN HE GAVE A LOW DISTINCT WHISTLE
IT WAS ANSWERED FROM UNDER
THE BLUFF
TOM WHISTLED TWICE MORE THESE SIGNALS WERE ANSWERED IN THE
SAME WAY
THEN A GUARDED VOICE SAID
WHO GOES THERE
TOM SAWYER THE BLACK AVENGER OF THE SPANISH MAIN
NAME YOUR NAMES
HUCK FINN THE RED HANDED AND JOE HARPER THE TERROR OF THE SEAS TOM
HAD FURNISHED THESE TITLES FROM HIS FAVORITE LITERATURE
'TIS WELL
GIVE THE COUNTERSIGN
TWO HOARSE WHISPERS DELIVERED THE SAME AWFUL WORD SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE
BROODING NIGHT
BLOOD
THEN TOM TUMBLED HIS HAM OVER THE BLUFF AND LET HIMSELF DOWN AFTER IT
TEARING BOTH SKIN AND CLOTHES TO SOME EXTENT IN THE EFFORT
THERE WAS
AN EASY COMFORTABLE PATH ALONG THE SHORE UNDER THE BLUFF BUT IT LACKED
THE ADVANTAGES OF DIFFICULTY AND DANGER SO VALUED BY A PIRATE
THE TERROR OF THE SEAS HAD BROUGHT A SIDE OF BACON AND HAD ABOUT WORN
HIMSELF OUT WITH GETTING IT THERE
FINN THE RED HANDED HAD STOLEN A
SKILLET AND A QUANTITY OF HALF CURED LEAF TOBACCO AND HAD ALSO BROUGHT
A FEW CORN COBS TO MAKE PIPES WITH
BUT NONE OF THE PIRATES SMOKED OR
CHEWED BUT HIMSELF
THE BLACK AVENGER OF THE SPANISH MAIN SAID IT
WOULD NEVER DO TO START WITHOUT SOME FIRE
THAT WAS A WISE THOUGHT
MATCHES WERE HARDLY KNOWN THERE IN THAT DAY
THEY SAW A FIRE SMOULDERING
UPON A GREAT RAFT A HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE AND THEY WENT STEALTHILY
THITHER AND HELPED THEMSELVES TO A CHUNK
THEY MADE AN IMPOSING
ADVENTURE OF IT SAYING HIST EVERY NOW AND THEN AND SUDDENLY
HALTING WITH FINGER ON LIP MOVING WITH HANDS ON IMAGINARY DAGGER HILTS
AND GIVING ORDERS IN DISMAL WHISPERS THAT IF THE FOE STIRRED TO LET
HIM HAVE IT TO THE HILT BECAUSE DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES THEY KNEW
WELL ENOUGH THAT THE RAFTSMEN WERE ALL DOWN AT THE VILLAGE LAYING
IN STORES OR HAVING A SPREE BUT STILL THAT WAS NO EXCUSE FOR THEIR
CONDUCTING THIS THING IN AN UNPIRATICAL WAY
THEY SHOVED OFF PRESENTLY TOM IN COMMAND HUCK AT THE AFTER OAR AND
JOE AT THE FORWARD
TOM STOOD AMIDSHIPS GLOOMY BROWED AND WITH FOLDED
ARMS AND GAVE HIS ORDERS IN A LOW STERN WHISPER
LUFF AND BRING HER TO THE WIND
AYE AYE SIR
STEADY STEADY Y Y Y
STEADY IT IS SIR
LET HER GO OFF A POINT
POINT IT IS SIR
AS THE BOYS STEADILY AND MONOTONOUSLY DROVE THE RAFT TOWARD MID STREAM
IT WAS NO DOUBT UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE ORDERS WERE GIVEN ONLY FOR
STYLE AND WERE NOT INTENDED TO MEAN ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
WHAT SAIL'S SHE CARRYING
COURSES TOPS'LS AND FLYING JIB SIR
SEND THE R'YALS UP LAY OUT ALOFT THERE HALF A DOZEN OF
YE FORETOPMASTSTUNS'L LIVELY NOW
AYE AYE SIR
SHAKE OUT THAT MAINTOGALANS'L SHEETS AND BRACES NOW MY HEARTIES
AYE AYE SIR
HELLUM A LEE HARD A PORT STAND BY TO MEET HER WHEN SHE COMES PORT
PORT NOW MEN WITH A WILL STEAD Y Y Y
STEADY IT IS SIR
THE RAFT DREW BEYOND THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER THE BOYS POINTED HER HEAD
RIGHT AND THEN LAY ON THEIR OARS
THE RIVER WAS NOT HIGH SO THERE WAS
NOT MORE THAN A TWO OR THREE MILE CURRENT
HARDLY A WORD WAS SAID DURING
THE NEXT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
NOW THE RAFT WAS PASSING BEFORE
THE DISTANT TOWN
TWO OR THREE GLIMMERING LIGHTS SHOWED WHERE IT LAY
PEACEFULLY SLEEPING BEYOND THE VAGUE VAST SWEEP OF STAR GEMMED WATER
UNCONSCIOUS OF THE TREMENDOUS EVENT THAT WAS HAPPENING
THE BLACK
AVENGER STOOD STILL WITH FOLDED ARMS LOOKING HIS LAST UPON THE SCENE
OF HIS FORMER JOYS AND HIS LATER SUFFERINGS AND WISHING SHE COULD SEE
HIM NOW ABROAD ON THE WILD SEA FACING PERIL AND DEATH WITH DAUNTLESS
HEART GOING TO HIS DOOM WITH A GRIM SMILE ON HIS LIPS
IT WAS BUT
A SMALL STRAIN ON HIS IMAGINATION TO REMOVE JACKSON'S ISLAND BEYOND
EYE SHOT OF THE VILLAGE AND SO HE LOOKED HIS LAST WITH A BROKEN AND
SATISFIED HEART
THE OTHER PIRATES WERE LOOKING THEIR LAST TOO AND
THEY ALL LOOKED SO LONG THAT THEY CAME NEAR LETTING THE CURRENT DRIFT
THEM OUT OF THE RANGE OF THE ISLAND
BUT THEY DISCOVERED THE DANGER IN
TIME AND MADE SHIFT TO AVERT IT
ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE
RAFT GROUNDED ON THE BAR TWO HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
AND THEY WADED BACK AND FORTH UNTIL THEY HAD LANDED THEIR FREIGHT
PART
OF THE LITTLE RAFT'S BELONGINGS CONSISTED OF AN OLD SAIL AND THIS THEY
SPREAD OVER A NOOK IN THE BUSHES FOR A TENT TO SHELTER THEIR PROVISIONS
BUT THEY THEMSELVES WOULD SLEEP IN THE OPEN AIR IN GOOD WEATHER AS
BECAME OUTLAWS
THEY BUILT A FIRE AGAINST THE SIDE OF A GREAT LOG TWENTY OR THIRTY STEPS
WITHIN THE SOMBRE DEPTHS OF THE FOREST AND THEN COOKED SOME BACON IN
THE FRYING PAN FOR SUPPER AND USED UP HALF OF THE CORN PONE STOCK
THEY HAD BROUGHT
IT SEEMED GLORIOUS SPORT TO BE FEASTING IN THAT WILD
FREE WAY IN THE VIRGIN FOREST OF AN UNEXPLORED AND UNINHABITED ISLAND
FAR FROM THE HAUNTS OF MEN AND THEY SAID THEY NEVER WOULD RETURN TO
CIVILIZATION
THE CLIMBING FIRE LIT UP THEIR FACES AND THREW ITS RUDDY
GLARE UPON THE PILLARED TREE TRUNKS OF THEIR FOREST TEMPLE AND UPON THE
VARNISHED FOLIAGE AND FESTOONING VINES
WHEN THE LAST CRISP SLICE OF BACON WAS GONE AND THE LAST ALLOWANCE
OF CORN PONE DEVOURED THE BOYS STRETCHED THEMSELVES OUT ON THE GRASS
FILLED WITH CONTENTMENT
THEY COULD HAVE FOUND A COOLER PLACE BUT
THEY WOULD NOT DENY THEMSELVES SUCH A ROMANTIC FEATURE AS THE ROASTING
CAMPFIRE
AIN'T IT GAY SAID JOE
IT'S NUTS SAID TOM
WHAT WOULD THE BOYS SAY IF THEY COULD SEE US
SAY WELL THEY'D JUST DIE TO BE HERE HEY HUCKY
I RECKON SO SAID HUCKLEBERRY ANYWAYS I'M SUITED
I DON'T WANT
NOTHING BETTER'N THIS
I DON'T EVER GET ENOUGH TO EAT GEN'ALLY AND HERE
THEY CAN'T COME AND PICK AT A FELLER AND BULLYRAG HIM SO
IT'S JUST THE LIFE FOR ME SAID TOM
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET UP
MORNINGS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND WASH AND ALL THAT
BLAME FOOLISHNESS
YOU SEE A PIRATE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING JOE
WHEN HE'S ASHORE BUT A HERMIT HE HAS TO BE PRAYING CONSIDERABLE AND
THEN HE DON'T HAVE ANY FUN ANYWAY ALL BY HIMSELF THAT WAY
OH YES THAT'S SO SAID JOE BUT I HADN'T THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT IT YOU
KNOW
I'D A GOOD DEAL RATHER BE A PIRATE NOW THAT I'VE TRIED IT
YOU SEE SAID TOM PEOPLE DON'T GO MUCH ON HERMITS NOWADAYS LIKE
THEY USED TO IN OLD TIMES BUT A PIRATE'S ALWAYS RESPECTED
AND
A HERMIT'S GOT TO SLEEP ON THE HARDEST PLACE HE CAN FIND AND PUT
SACKCLOTH AND ASHES ON HIS HEAD AND STAND OUT IN THE RAIN AND
WHAT DOES HE PUT SACKCLOTH AND ASHES ON HIS HEAD FOR INQUIRED HUCK
I DONO
BUT THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT
HERMITS ALWAYS DO
YOU'D HAVE TO DO
THAT IF YOU WAS A HERMIT
DERN'D IF I WOULD SAID HUCK
WELL WHAT WOULD YOU DO
I DONO
BUT I WOULDN'T DO THAT
WHY HUCK YOU'D HAVE TO
HOW'D YOU GET AROUND IT
WHY I JUST WOULDN'T STAND IT
I'D RUN AWAY
RUN AWAY WELL YOU WOULD BE A NICE OLD SLOUCH OF A HERMIT
YOU'D BE
A DISGRACE
THE RED HANDED MADE NO RESPONSE BEING BETTER EMPLOYED
HE HAD FINISHED
GOUGING OUT A COB AND NOW HE FITTED A WEED STEM TO IT LOADED IT WITH
TOBACCO AND WAS PRESSING A COAL TO THE CHARGE AND BLOWING A CLOUD OF
FRAGRANT SMOKE HE WAS IN THE FULL BLOOM OF LUXURIOUS CONTENTMENT
THE
OTHER PIRATES ENVIED HIM THIS MAJESTIC VICE AND SECRETLY RESOLVED TO
ACQUIRE IT SHORTLY
PRESENTLY HUCK SAID
WHAT DOES PIRATES HAVE TO DO
TOM SAID
OH THEY HAVE JUST A BULLY TIME TAKE SHIPS AND BURN THEM AND GET THE
MONEY AND BURY IT IN AWFUL PLACES IN THEIR ISLAND WHERE THERE'S GHOSTS
AND THINGS TO WATCH IT AND KILL EVERYBODY IN THE SHIPS MAKE 'EM WALK A
PLANK
AND THEY CARRY THE WOMEN TO THE ISLAND SAID JOE THEY DON'T KILL THE
WOMEN
NO ASSENTED TOM THEY DON'T KILL THE WOMEN THEY'RE TOO NOBLE
AND
THE WOMEN'S ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL TOO
AND DON'T THEY WEAR THE BULLIEST CLOTHES OH NO ALL GOLD AND SILVER
AND DI'MONDS SAID JOE WITH ENTHUSIASM
WHO SAID HUCK
WHY THE PIRATES
HUCK SCANNED HIS OWN CLOTHING FORLORNLY
I RECKON I AIN'T DRESSED FITTEN FOR A PIRATE SAID HE WITH A
REGRETFUL PATHOS IN HIS VOICE BUT I AIN'T GOT NONE BUT THESE
BUT THE OTHER BOYS TOLD HIM THE FINE CLOTHES WOULD COME FAST ENOUGH
AFTER THEY SHOULD HAVE BEGUN THEIR ADVENTURES
THEY MADE HIM UNDERSTAND
THAT HIS POOR RAGS WOULD DO TO BEGIN WITH THOUGH IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR
WEALTHY PIRATES TO START WITH A PROPER WARDROBE
GRADUALLY THEIR TALK DIED OUT AND DROWSINESS BEGAN TO STEAL UPON THE
EYELIDS OF THE LITTLE WAIFS
THE PIPE DROPPED FROM THE FINGERS OF THE
RED HANDED AND HE SLEPT THE SLEEP OF THE CONSCIENCE FREE AND THE WEARY
THE TERROR OF THE SEAS AND THE BLACK AVENGER OF THE SPANISH MAIN HAD
MORE DIFFICULTY IN GETTING TO SLEEP
THEY SAID THEIR PRAYERS INWARDLY
AND LYING DOWN SINCE THERE WAS NOBODY THERE WITH AUTHORITY TO MAKE THEM
KNEEL AND RECITE ALOUD IN TRUTH THEY HAD A MIND NOT TO SAY THEM AT
ALL BUT THEY WERE AFRAID TO PROCEED TO SUCH LENGTHS AS THAT LEST THEY
MIGHT CALL DOWN A SUDDEN AND SPECIAL THUNDERBOLT FROM HEAVEN
THEN AT
ONCE THEY REACHED AND HOVERED UPON THE IMMINENT VERGE OF SLEEP BUT AN
INTRUDER CAME NOW THAT WOULD NOT DOWN IT WAS CONSCIENCE
THEY BEGAN
TO FEEL A VAGUE FEAR THAT THEY HAD BEEN DOING WRONG TO RUN AWAY AND
NEXT THEY THOUGHT OF THE STOLEN MEAT AND THEN THE REAL TORTURE CAME
THEY TRIED TO ARGUE IT AWAY BY REMINDING CONSCIENCE THAT THEY HAD
PURLOINED SWEETMEATS AND APPLES SCORES OF TIMES BUT CONSCIENCE WAS NOT
TO BE APPEASED BY SUCH THIN PLAUSIBILITIES IT SEEMED TO THEM IN THE
END THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AROUND THE STUBBORN FACT THAT TAKING
SWEETMEATS WAS ONLY HOOKING WHILE TAKING BACON AND HAMS AND SUCH
VALUABLES WAS PLAIN SIMPLE STEALING AND THERE WAS A COMMAND AGAINST THAT
IN THE BIBLE
SO THEY INWARDLY RESOLVED THAT SO LONG AS THEY REMAINED IN
THE BUSINESS THEIR PIRACIES SHOULD NOT AGAIN BE SULLIED WITH THE
CRIME OF STEALING
THEN CONSCIENCE GRANTED A TRUCE AND THESE CURIOUSLY
INCONSISTENT PIRATES FELL PEACEFULLY TO SLEEP
CHAPTER XIV
WHEN TOM AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE WONDERED WHERE HE WAS
HE SAT UP AND
RUBBED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AROUND
THEN HE COMPREHENDED
IT WAS THE COOL
GRAY DAWN AND THERE WAS A DELICIOUS SENSE OF REPOSE AND PEACE IN THE
DEEP PERVADING CALM AND SILENCE OF THE WOODS
NOT A LEAF STIRRED NOT
A SOUND OBTRUDED UPON GREAT NATURE'S MEDITATION
BEADED DEWDROPS STOOD
UPON THE LEAVES AND GRASSES
A WHITE LAYER OF ASHES COVERED THE FIRE
AND A THIN BLUE BREATH OF SMOKE ROSE STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
JOE AND HUCK
STILL SLEPT
NOW FAR AWAY IN THE WOODS A BIRD CALLED ANOTHER ANSWERED PRESENTLY
THE HAMMERING OF A WOODPECKER WAS HEARD
GRADUALLY THE COOL DIM GRAY
OF THE MORNING WHITENED AND AS GRADUALLY SOUNDS MULTIPLIED AND LIFE
MANIFESTED ITSELF
THE MARVEL OF NATURE SHAKING OFF SLEEP AND GOING
TO WORK UNFOLDED ITSELF TO THE MUSING BOY
A LITTLE GREEN WORM CAME
CRAWLING OVER A DEWY LEAF LIFTING TWO THIRDS OF HIS BODY INTO THE AIR
FROM TIME TO TIME AND SNIFFING AROUND THEN PROCEEDING AGAIN FOR HE
WAS MEASURING TOM SAID AND WHEN THE WORM APPROACHED HIM OF ITS OWN
ACCORD HE SAT AS STILL AS A STONE WITH HIS HOPES RISING AND FALLING
BY TURNS AS THE CREATURE STILL CAME TOWARD HIM OR SEEMED INCLINED TO
GO ELSEWHERE AND WHEN AT LAST IT CONSIDERED A PAINFUL MOMENT WITH ITS
CURVED BODY IN THE AIR AND THEN CAME DECISIVELY DOWN UPON TOM'S LEG AND
BEGAN A JOURNEY OVER HIM HIS WHOLE HEART WAS GLAD FOR THAT MEANT THAT
HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES WITHOUT THE SHADOW OF A
DOUBT A GAUDY PIRATICAL UNIFORM
NOW A PROCESSION OF ANTS APPEARED
FROM NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR AND WENT ABOUT THEIR LABORS ONE STRUGGLED
MANFULLY BY WITH A DEAD SPIDER FIVE TIMES AS BIG AS ITSELF IN ITS ARMS
AND LUGGED IT STRAIGHT UP A TREE TRUNK
A BROWN SPOTTED LADY BUG CLIMBED
THE DIZZY HEIGHT OF A GRASS BLADE AND TOM BENT DOWN CLOSE TO IT AND
SAID LADY BUG LADY BUG FLY AWAY HOME YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE YOUR
CHILDREN'S ALONE AND SHE TOOK WING AND WENT OFF TO SEE ABOUT IT WHICH
DID NOT SURPRISE THE BOY FOR HE KNEW OF OLD THAT THIS INSECT WAS
CREDULOUS ABOUT CONFLAGRATIONS AND HE HAD PRACTISED UPON ITS SIMPLICITY
MORE THAN ONCE
A TUMBLEBUG CAME NEXT HEAVING STURDILY AT ITS BALL AND
TOM TOUCHED THE CREATURE TO SEE IT SHUT ITS LEGS AGAINST ITS BODY
AND PRETEND TO BE DEAD
THE BIRDS WERE FAIRLY RIOTING BY THIS TIME
A
CATBIRD THE NORTHERN MOCKER LIT IN A TREE OVER TOM'S HEAD AND TRILLED
OUT HER IMITATIONS OF HER NEIGHBORS IN A RAPTURE OF ENJOYMENT THEN
A SHRILL JAY SWEPT DOWN A FLASH OF BLUE FLAME AND STOPPED ON A TWIG
ALMOST WITHIN THE BOY'S REACH COCKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND EYED THE
STRANGERS WITH A CONSUMING CURIOSITY A GRAY SQUIRREL AND A BIG FELLOW
OF THE FOX KIND CAME SKURRYING ALONG SITTING UP AT INTERVALS TO
INSPECT AND CHATTER AT THE BOYS FOR THE WILD THINGS HAD PROBABLY NEVER
SEEN A HUMAN BEING BEFORE AND SCARCELY KNEW WHETHER TO BE AFRAID OR NOT
ALL NATURE WAS WIDE AWAKE AND STIRRING NOW LONG LANCES OF SUNLIGHT
PIERCED DOWN THROUGH THE DENSE FOLIAGE FAR AND NEAR AND A FEW
BUTTERFLIES CAME FLUTTERING UPON THE SCENE
TOM STIRRED UP THE OTHER PIRATES AND THEY ALL CLATTERED AWAY WITH
A SHOUT AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO WERE STRIPPED AND CHASING AFTER AND
TUMBLING OVER EACH OTHER IN THE SHALLOW LIMPID WATER OF THE WHITE
SANDBAR
THEY FELT NO LONGING FOR THE LITTLE VILLAGE SLEEPING IN THE
DISTANCE BEYOND THE MAJESTIC WASTE OF WATER
A VAGRANT CURRENT OR A
SLIGHT RISE IN THE RIVER HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR RAFT BUT THIS ONLY
GRATIFIED THEM SINCE ITS GOING WAS SOMETHING LIKE BURNING THE BRIDGE
BETWEEN THEM AND CIVILIZATION
THEY CAME BACK TO CAMP WONDERFULLY REFRESHED GLAD HEARTED AND
RAVENOUS AND THEY SOON HAD THE CAMP FIRE BLAZING UP AGAIN
HUCK FOUND A
SPRING OF CLEAR COLD WATER CLOSE BY AND THE BOYS MADE CUPS OF BROAD OAK
OR HICKORY LEAVES AND FELT THAT WATER SWEETENED WITH SUCH A WILDWOOD
CHARM AS THAT WOULD BE A GOOD ENOUGH SUBSTITUTE FOR COFFEE
WHILE JOE
WAS SLICING BACON FOR BREAKFAST TOM AND HUCK ASKED HIM TO HOLD ON A
MINUTE THEY STEPPED TO A PROMISING NOOK IN THE RIVER BANK AND THREW IN
THEIR LINES ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THEY HAD REWARD
JOE HAD NOT HAD TIME
TO GET IMPATIENT BEFORE THEY WERE BACK AGAIN WITH SOME HANDSOME BASS
A COUPLE OF SUN PERCH AND A SMALL CATFISH PROVISIONS ENOUGH FOR QUITE A
FAMILY
THEY FRIED THE FISH WITH THE BACON AND WERE ASTONISHED FOR
NO FISH HAD EVER SEEMED SO DELICIOUS BEFORE
THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THE
QUICKER A FRESH WATER FISH IS ON THE FIRE AFTER HE IS CAUGHT THE BETTER
HE IS AND THEY REFLECTED LITTLE UPON WHAT A SAUCE OPEN AIR SLEEPING
OPEN AIR EXERCISE BATHING AND A LARGE INGREDIENT OF HUNGER MAKE TOO
THEY LAY AROUND IN THE SHADE AFTER BREAKFAST WHILE HUCK HAD A SMOKE
AND THEN WENT OFF THROUGH THE WOODS ON AN EXPLORING EXPEDITION
THEY
TRAMPED GAYLY ALONG OVER DECAYING LOGS THROUGH TANGLED UNDERBRUSH
AMONG SOLEMN MONARCHS OF THE FOREST HUNG FROM THEIR CROWNS TO THE
GROUND WITH A DROOPING REGALIA OF GRAPE VINES
NOW AND THEN THEY CAME
UPON SNUG NOOKS CARPETED WITH GRASS AND JEWELED WITH FLOWERS
THEY FOUND PLENTY OF THINGS TO BE DELIGHTED WITH BUT NOTHING TO BE
ASTONISHED AT
THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE ISLAND WAS ABOUT THREE MILES
LONG AND A QUARTER OF A MILE WIDE AND THAT THE SHORE IT LAY CLOSEST TO
WAS ONLY SEPARATED FROM IT BY A NARROW CHANNEL HARDLY TWO HUNDRED YARDS
WIDE
THEY TOOK A SWIM ABOUT EVERY HOUR SO IT WAS CLOSE UPON THE MIDDLE
OF THE AFTERNOON WHEN THEY GOT BACK TO CAMP
THEY WERE TOO HUNGRY TO
STOP TO FISH BUT THEY FARED SUMPTUOUSLY UPON COLD HAM AND THEN THREW
THEMSELVES DOWN IN THE SHADE TO TALK
BUT THE TALK SOON BEGAN TO DRAG
AND THEN DIED
THE STILLNESS THE SOLEMNITY THAT BROODED IN THE WOODS
AND THE SENSE OF LONELINESS BEGAN TO TELL UPON THE SPIRITS OF THE BOYS
THEY FELL TO THINKING
A SORT OF UNDEFINED LONGING CREPT UPON THEM
THIS
TOOK DIM SHAPE PRESENTLY IT WAS BUDDING HOMESICKNESS
EVEN FINN THE
RED HANDED WAS DREAMING OF HIS DOORSTEPS AND EMPTY HOGSHEADS
BUT THEY
WERE ALL ASHAMED OF THEIR WEAKNESS AND NONE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO SPEAK
HIS THOUGHT
FOR SOME TIME NOW THE BOYS HAD BEEN DULLY CONSCIOUS OF A PECULIAR
SOUND IN THE DISTANCE JUST AS ONE SOMETIMES IS OF THE TICKING OF A
CLOCK WHICH HE TAKES NO DISTINCT NOTE OF
BUT NOW THIS MYSTERIOUS SOUND
BECAME MORE PRONOUNCED AND FORCED A RECOGNITION
THE BOYS STARTED
GLANCED AT EACH OTHER AND THEN EACH ASSUMED A LISTENING ATTITUDE
THERE
WAS A LONG SILENCE PROFOUND AND UNBROKEN THEN A DEEP SULLEN BOOM CAME
FLOATING DOWN OUT OF THE DISTANCE
WHAT IS IT EXCLAIMED JOE UNDER HIS BREATH
I WONDER SAID TOM IN A WHISPER
'TAIN'T THUNDER SAID HUCKLEBERRY IN AN AWED TONE BECUZ THUNDER
HARK SAID TOM
LISTEN DON'T TALK
THEY WAITED A TIME THAT SEEMED AN AGE AND THEN THE SAME MUFFLED BOOM
TROUBLED THE SOLEMN HUSH
LET'S GO AND SEE
THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET AND HURRIED TO THE SHORE TOWARD THE TOWN
THEY
PARTED THE BUSHES ON THE BANK AND PEERED OUT OVER THE WATER
THE LITTLE
STEAM FERRY BOAT WAS ABOUT A MILE BELOW THE VILLAGE DRIFTING WITH THE
CURRENT
HER BROAD DECK SEEMED CROWDED WITH PEOPLE
THERE WERE A GREAT
MANY SKIFFS ROWING ABOUT OR FLOATING WITH THE STREAM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF THE FERRYBOAT BUT THE BOYS COULD NOT DETERMINE WHAT THE MEN IN
THEM WERE DOING
PRESENTLY A GREAT JET OF WHITE SMOKE BURST FROM THE
FERRYBOAT'S SIDE AND AS IT EXPANDED AND ROSE IN A LAZY CLOUD THAT SAME
DULL THROB OF SOUND WAS BORNE TO THE LISTENERS AGAIN
I KNOW NOW EXCLAIMED TOM SOMEBODY'S DROWNDED
THAT'S IT SAID HUCK THEY DONE THAT LAST SUMMER WHEN BILL TURNER
GOT DROWNDED THEY SHOOT A CANNON OVER THE WATER AND THAT MAKES
HIM COME UP TO THE TOP
YES AND THEY TAKE LOAVES OF BREAD AND PUT
QUICKSILVER IN 'EM AND SET 'EM AFLOAT AND WHEREVER THERE'S ANYBODY
THAT'S DROWNDED THEY'LL FLOAT RIGHT THERE AND STOP
YES I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT SAID JOE
I WONDER WHAT MAKES THE BREAD
DO THAT
OH IT AIN'T THE BREAD SO MUCH SAID TOM I RECKON IT'S MOSTLY WHAT
THEY SAY OVER IT BEFORE THEY START IT OUT
BUT THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING OVER IT SAID HUCK
I'VE SEEN 'EM AND
THEY DON'T
WELL THAT'S FUNNY SAID TOM
BUT MAYBE THEY SAY IT TO THEMSELVES
OF
COURSE THEY DO
ANYBODY MIGHT KNOW THAT
THE OTHER BOYS AGREED THAT THERE WAS REASON IN WHAT TOM SAID BECAUSE
AN IGNORANT LUMP OF BREAD UNINSTRUCTED BY AN INCANTATION COULD NOT
BE EXPECTED TO ACT VERY INTELLIGENTLY WHEN SET UPON AN ERRAND OF SUCH
GRAVITY
BY JINGS I WISH I WAS OVER THERE NOW SAID JOE
I DO TOO SAID HUCK I'D GIVE HEAPS TO KNOW WHO IT IS
THE BOYS STILL LISTENED AND WATCHED
PRESENTLY A REVEALING THOUGHT
FLASHED THROUGH TOM'S MIND AND HE EXCLAIMED
BOYS I KNOW WHO'S DROWNDED IT'S US
THEY FELT LIKE HEROES IN AN INSTANT
HERE WAS A GORGEOUS TRIUMPH THEY
WERE MISSED THEY WERE MOURNED HEARTS WERE BREAKING ON THEIR ACCOUNT
TEARS WERE BEING SHED ACCUSING MEMORIES OF UNKINDNESS TO THESE POOR
LOST LADS WERE RISING UP AND UNAVAILING REGRETS AND REMORSE WERE BEING
INDULGED AND BEST OF ALL THE DEPARTED WERE THE TALK OF THE WHOLE TOWN
AND THE ENVY OF ALL THE BOYS AS FAR AS THIS DAZZLING NOTORIETY WAS
CONCERNED
THIS WAS FINE
IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO BE A PIRATE AFTER ALL
AS TWILIGHT DREW ON THE FERRYBOAT WENT BACK TO HER ACCUSTOMED BUSINESS
AND THE SKIFFS DISAPPEARED
THE PIRATES RETURNED TO CAMP
THEY WERE
JUBILANT WITH VANITY OVER THEIR NEW GRANDEUR AND THE ILLUSTRIOUS TROUBLE
THEY WERE MAKING
THEY CAUGHT FISH COOKED SUPPER AND ATE IT AND THEN
FELL TO GUESSING AT WHAT THE VILLAGE WAS THINKING AND SAYING ABOUT THEM
AND THE PICTURES THEY DREW OF THE PUBLIC DISTRESS ON THEIR ACCOUNT WERE
GRATIFYING TO LOOK UPON FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
BUT WHEN THE SHADOWS
OF NIGHT CLOSED THEM IN THEY GRADUALLY CEASED TO TALK AND SAT GAZING
INTO THE FIRE WITH THEIR MINDS EVIDENTLY WANDERING ELSEWHERE
THE
EXCITEMENT WAS GONE NOW AND TOM AND JOE COULD NOT KEEP BACK THOUGHTS
OF CERTAIN PERSONS AT HOME WHO WERE NOT ENJOYING THIS FINE FROLIC AS
MUCH AS THEY WERE
MISGIVINGS CAME THEY GREW TROUBLED AND UNHAPPY A
SIGH OR TWO ESCAPED UNAWARES
BY AND BY JOE TIMIDLY VENTURED UPON A
ROUNDABOUT FEELER AS TO HOW THE OTHERS MIGHT LOOK UPON A RETURN TO
CIVILIZATION NOT RIGHT NOW BUT
TOM WITHERED HIM WITH DERISION HUCK BEING UNCOMMITTED AS YET JOINED
IN WITH TOM AND THE WAVERER QUICKLY EXPLAINED AND WAS GLAD TO GET
OUT OF THE SCRAPE WITH AS LITTLE TAINT OF CHICKEN HEARTED HOME SICKNESS
CLINGING TO HIS GARMENTS AS HE COULD
MUTINY WAS EFFECTUALLY LAID TO
REST FOR THE MOMENT
AS THE NIGHT DEEPENED HUCK BEGAN TO NOD AND PRESENTLY TO SNORE
JOE FOLLOWED NEXT
TOM LAY UPON HIS ELBOW MOTIONLESS FOR SOME TIME
WATCHING THE TWO INTENTLY
AT LAST HE GOT UP CAUTIOUSLY ON HIS KNEES
AND WENT SEARCHING AMONG THE GRASS AND THE FLICKERING REFLECTIONS FLUNG
BY THE CAMPFIRE
HE PICKED UP AND INSPECTED SEVERAL LARGE SEMI CYLINDERS
OF THE THIN WHITE BARK OF A SYCAMORE AND FINALLY CHOSE TWO WHICH SEEMED
TO SUIT HIM
THEN HE KNELT BY THE FIRE AND PAINFULLY WROTE SOMETHING
UPON EACH OF THESE WITH HIS RED KEEL ONE HE ROLLED UP AND PUT IN HIS
JACKET POCKET AND THE OTHER HE PUT IN JOE'S HAT AND REMOVED IT TO A
LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE OWNER
AND HE ALSO PUT INTO THE HAT CERTAIN
SCHOOLBOY TREASURES OF ALMOST INESTIMABLE VALUE AMONG THEM A LUMP OF
CHALK AN INDIA RUBBER BALL THREE FISHHOOKS AND ONE OF THAT KIND
OF MARBLES KNOWN AS A SURE 'NOUGH CRYSTAL THEN HE TIPTOED HIS WAY
CAUTIOUSLY AMONG THE TREES TILL HE FELT THAT HE WAS OUT OF HEARING AND
STRAIGHTWAY BROKE INTO A KEEN RUN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SANDBAR
CHAPTER XV
A FEW MINUTES LATER TOM WAS IN THE SHOAL WATER OF THE BAR WADING TOWARD
THE ILLINOIS SHORE
BEFORE THE DEPTH REACHED HIS MIDDLE HE WAS HALFWAY
OVER THE CURRENT WOULD PERMIT NO MORE WADING NOW SO HE STRUCK OUT
CONFIDENTLY TO SWIM THE REMAINING HUNDRED YARDS
HE SWAM QUARTERING
UPSTREAM BUT STILL WAS SWEPT DOWNWARD RATHER FASTER THAN HE HAD
EXPECTED
HOWEVER HE REACHED THE SHORE FINALLY AND DRIFTED ALONG TILL
HE FOUND A LOW PLACE AND DREW HIMSELF OUT
HE PUT HIS HAND ON HIS JACKET
POCKET FOUND HIS PIECE OF BARK SAFE AND THEN STRUCK THROUGH THE WOODS
FOLLOWING THE SHORE WITH STREAMING GARMENTS
SHORTLY BEFORE TEN
O'CLOCK HE CAME OUT INTO AN OPEN PLACE OPPOSITE THE VILLAGE AND SAW THE
FERRYBOAT LYING IN THE SHADOW OF THE TREES AND THE HIGH BANK
EVERYTHING
WAS QUIET UNDER THE BLINKING STARS
HE CREPT DOWN THE BANK WATCHING
WITH ALL HIS EYES SLIPPED INTO THE WATER SWAM THREE OR FOUR STROKES
AND CLIMBED INTO THE SKIFF THAT DID YAWL DUTY AT THE BOAT'S STERN
HE
LAID HIMSELF DOWN UNDER THE THWARTS AND WAITED PANTING
PRESENTLY THE CRACKED BELL TAPPED AND A VOICE GAVE THE ORDER TO CAST
OFF A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THE SKIFF'S HEAD WAS STANDING HIGH UP
AGAINST THE BOAT'S SWELL AND THE VOYAGE WAS BEGUN
TOM FELT HAPPY IN
HIS SUCCESS FOR HE KNEW IT WAS THE BOAT'S LAST TRIP FOR THE NIGHT
AT
THE END OF A LONG TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MINUTES THE WHEELS STOPPED AND
TOM SLIPPED OVERBOARD AND SWAM ASHORE IN THE DUSK LANDING FIFTY YARDS
DOWNSTREAM OUT OF DANGER OF POSSIBLE STRAGGLERS
HE FLEW ALONG UNFREQUENTED ALLEYS AND SHORTLY FOUND HIMSELF AT HIS
AUNT'S BACK FENCE
HE CLIMBED OVER APPROACHED THE ELL AND LOOKED
IN AT THE SITTING ROOM WINDOW FOR A LIGHT WAS BURNING THERE
THERE
SAT AUNT POLLY SID MARY AND JOE HARPER'S MOTHER GROUPED TOGETHER
TALKING
THEY WERE BY THE BED AND THE BED WAS BETWEEN THEM AND THE
DOOR
TOM WENT TO THE DOOR AND BEGAN TO SOFTLY LIFT THE LATCH THEN
HE PRESSED GENTLY AND THE DOOR YIELDED A CRACK HE CONTINUED PUSHING
CAUTIOUSLY AND QUAKING EVERY TIME IT CREAKED TILL HE JUDGED HE MIGHT
SQUEEZE THROUGH ON HIS KNEES SO HE PUT HIS HEAD THROUGH AND BEGAN
WARILY
WHAT MAKES THE CANDLE BLOW SO SAID AUNT POLLY
TOM HURRIED UP
WHY
THAT DOOR'S OPEN I BELIEVE
WHY OF COURSE IT IS
NO END OF STRANGE
THINGS NOW
GO 'LONG AND SHUT IT SID
TOM DISAPPEARED UNDER THE BED JUST IN TIME
HE LAY AND BREATHED
HIMSELF FOR A TIME AND THEN CREPT TO WHERE HE COULD ALMOST TOUCH HIS
AUNT'S FOOT
BUT AS I WAS SAYING SAID AUNT POLLY HE WARN'T BAD SO TO SAY ONLY
MISCH EE VOUS
ONLY JUST GIDDY AND HARUM SCARUM YOU KNOW
HE WARN'T
ANY MORE RESPONSIBLE THAN A COLT
HE NEVER MEANT ANY HARM AND HE WAS
THE BEST HEARTED BOY THAT EVER WAS AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY
IT WAS JUST SO WITH MY JOE ALWAYS FULL OF HIS DEVILMENT AND UP TO
EVERY KIND OF MISCHIEF BUT HE WAS JUST AS UNSELFISH AND KIND AS HE
COULD BE AND LAWS BLESS ME TO THINK I WENT AND WHIPPED HIM FOR TAKING
THAT CREAM NEVER ONCE RECOLLECTING THAT I THROWED IT OUT MYSELF BECAUSE
IT WAS SOUR AND I NEVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN IN THIS WORLD NEVER NEVER
NEVER POOR ABUSED BOY AND MRS
HARPER SOBBED AS IF HER HEART WOULD
BREAK
I HOPE TOM'S BETTER OFF WHERE HE IS SAID SID BUT IF HE'D BEEN
BETTER IN SOME WAYS
SID TOM FELT THE GLARE OF THE OLD LADY'S EYE THOUGH HE COULD NOT
SEE IT
NOT A WORD AGAINST MY TOM NOW THAT HE'S GONE GOD'LL TAKE CARE
OF HIM NEVER YOU TROUBLE YOUR SELF SIR OH MRS
HARPER I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO GIVE HIM UP I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GIVE HIM UP HE WAS SUCH A
COMFORT TO ME ALTHOUGH HE TORMENTED MY OLD HEART OUT OF ME 'MOST
THE LORD GIVETH AND THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY BLESSED BE THE NAME OF
THE LORD BUT IT'S SO HARD OH IT'S SO HARD ONLY LAST SATURDAY MY JOE
BUSTED A FIRECRACKER RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE AND I KNOCKED HIM SPRAWLING
LITTLE DID I KNOW THEN HOW SOON OH IF IT WAS TO DO OVER AGAIN I'D HUG
HIM AND BLESS HIM FOR IT
YES YES YES I KNOW JUST HOW YOU FEEL MRS
HARPER I KNOW JUST
EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL
NO LONGER AGO THAN YESTERDAY NOON MY TOM TOOK
AND FILLED THE CAT FULL OF PAIN KILLER AND I DID THINK THE CRETUR WOULD
TEAR THE HOUSE DOWN
AND GOD FORGIVE ME I CRACKED TOM'S HEAD WITH MY
THIMBLE POOR BOY POOR DEAD BOY
BUT HE'S OUT OF ALL HIS TROUBLES NOW
AND THE LAST WORDS I EVER HEARD HIM SAY WAS TO REPROACH
BUT THIS MEMORY WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE OLD LADY AND SHE BROKE ENTIRELY
DOWN
TOM WAS SNUFFLING NOW HIMSELF AND MORE IN PITY OF HIMSELF THAN
ANYBODY ELSE
HE COULD HEAR MARY CRYING AND PUTTING IN A KINDLY WORD
FOR HIM FROM TIME TO TIME
HE BEGAN TO HAVE A NOBLER OPINION OF HIMSELF
THAN EVER BEFORE
STILL HE WAS SUFFICIENTLY TOUCHED BY HIS AUNT'S GRIEF
TO LONG TO RUSH OUT FROM UNDER THE BED AND OVERWHELM HER WITH JOY AND
THE THEATRICAL GORGEOUSNESS OF THE THING APPEALED STRONGLY TO HIS
NATURE TOO BUT HE RESISTED AND LAY STILL
HE WENT ON LISTENING AND GATHERED BY ODDS AND ENDS THAT IT WAS
CONJECTURED AT FIRST THAT THE BOYS HAD GOT DROWNED WHILE TAKING A SWIM
THEN THE SMALL RAFT HAD BEEN MISSED NEXT CERTAIN BOYS SAID THE MISSING
LADS HAD PROMISED THAT THE VILLAGE SHOULD HEAR SOMETHING SOON THE
WISE HEADS HAD PUT THIS AND THAT TOGETHER AND DECIDED THAT THE LADS
HAD GONE OFF ON THAT RAFT AND WOULD TURN UP AT THE NEXT TOWN BELOW
PRESENTLY BUT TOWARD NOON THE RAFT HAD BEEN FOUND LODGED AGAINST THE
MISSOURI SHORE SOME FIVE OR SIX MILES BELOW THE VILLAGE AND THEN HOPE
PERISHED THEY MUST BE DROWNED ELSE HUNGER WOULD HAVE DRIVEN THEM HOME
BY NIGHTFALL IF NOT SOONER
IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE SEARCH FOR THE
BODIES HAD BEEN A FRUITLESS EFFORT MERELY BECAUSE THE DROWNING MUST
HAVE OCCURRED IN MID CHANNEL SINCE THE BOYS BEING GOOD SWIMMERS WOULD
OTHERWISE HAVE ESCAPED TO SHORE
THIS WAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT
IF THE BODIES
CONTINUED MISSING UNTIL SUNDAY ALL HOPE WOULD BE GIVEN OVER AND THE
FUNERALS WOULD BE PREACHED ON THAT MORNING
TOM SHUDDERED
MRS
HARPER GAVE A SOBBING GOODNIGHT AND TURNED TO GO
THEN WITH A
MUTUAL IMPULSE THE TWO BEREAVED WOMEN FLUNG THEMSELVES INTO EACH OTHER'S
ARMS AND HAD A GOOD CONSOLING CRY AND THEN PARTED
AUNT POLLY WAS
TENDER FAR BEYOND HER WONT IN HER GOODNIGHT TO SID AND MARY
SID
SNUFFLED A BIT AND MARY WENT OFF CRYING WITH ALL HER HEART
AUNT POLLY KNELT DOWN AND PRAYED FOR TOM SO TOUCHINGLY SO APPEALINGLY
AND WITH SUCH MEASURELESS LOVE IN HER WORDS AND HER OLD TREMBLING VOICE
THAT HE WAS WELTERING IN TEARS AGAIN LONG BEFORE SHE WAS THROUGH
HE HAD TO KEEP STILL LONG AFTER SHE WENT TO BED FOR SHE KEPT MAKING
BROKEN HEARTED EJACULATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME TOSSING UNRESTFULLY AND
TURNING OVER
BUT AT LAST SHE WAS STILL ONLY MOANING A LITTLE IN HER
SLEEP
NOW THE BOY STOLE OUT ROSE GRADUALLY BY THE BEDSIDE SHADED THE
CANDLE LIGHT WITH HIS HAND AND STOOD REGARDING HER
HIS HEART WAS FULL
OF PITY FOR HER
HE TOOK OUT HIS SYCAMORE SCROLL AND PLACED IT BY THE
CANDLE
BUT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO HIM AND HE LINGERED CONSIDERING
HIS FACE LIGHTED WITH A HAPPY SOLUTION OF HIS THOUGHT HE PUT THE BARK
HASTILY IN HIS POCKET
THEN HE BENT OVER AND KISSED THE FADED LIPS AND
STRAIGHTWAY MADE HIS STEALTHY EXIT LATCHING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
HE THREADED HIS WAY BACK TO THE FERRY LANDING FOUND NOBODY AT LARGE
THERE AND WALKED BOLDLY ON BOARD THE BOAT FOR HE KNEW SHE WAS
TENANTLESS EXCEPT THAT THERE WAS A WATCHMAN WHO ALWAYS TURNED IN AND
SLEPT LIKE A GRAVEN IMAGE
HE UNTIED THE SKIFF AT THE STERN SLIPPED
INTO IT AND WAS SOON ROWING CAUTIOUSLY UPSTREAM
WHEN HE HAD PULLED A
MILE ABOVE THE VILLAGE HE STARTED QUARTERING ACROSS AND BENT HIMSELF
STOUTLY TO HIS WORK
HE HIT THE LANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE NEATLY FOR
THIS WAS A FAMILIAR BIT OF WORK TO HIM
HE WAS MOVED TO CAPTURE
THE SKIFF ARGUING THAT IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A SHIP AND THEREFORE
LEGITIMATE PREY FOR A PIRATE BUT HE KNEW A THOROUGH SEARCH WOULD BE
MADE FOR IT AND THAT MIGHT END IN REVELATIONS
SO HE STEPPED ASHORE AND
ENTERED THE WOODS
HE SAT DOWN AND TOOK A LONG REST TORTURING HIMSELF MEANWHILE TO KEEP
AWAKE AND THEN STARTED WARILY DOWN THE HOME STRETCH
THE NIGHT WAS FAR
SPENT
IT WAS BROAD DAYLIGHT BEFORE HE FOUND HIMSELF FAIRLY ABREAST THE
ISLAND BAR
HE RESTED AGAIN UNTIL THE SUN WAS WELL UP AND GILDING THE
GREAT RIVER WITH ITS SPLENDOR AND THEN HE PLUNGED INTO THE STREAM
A
LITTLE LATER HE PAUSED DRIPPING UPON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CAMP AND
HEARD JOE SAY
NO TOM'S TRUE BLUE HUCK AND HE'LL COME BACK
HE WON'T DESERT
HE
KNOWS THAT WOULD BE A DISGRACE TO A PIRATE AND TOM'S TOO PROUD FOR THAT
SORT OF THING
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING OR OTHER
NOW I WONDER WHAT
WELL THE THINGS IS OURS ANYWAY AIN'T THEY
PRETTY NEAR BUT NOT YET HUCK
THE WRITING SAYS THEY ARE IF HE AIN'T
BACK HERE TO BREAKFAST
WHICH HE IS EXCLAIMED TOM WITH FINE DRAMATIC EFFECT STEPPING
GRANDLY INTO CAMP
A SUMPTUOUS BREAKFAST OF BACON AND FISH WAS SHORTLY PROVIDED AND AS THE
BOYS SET TO WORK UPON IT TOM RECOUNTED AND ADORNED HIS ADVENTURES
THEY WERE A VAIN AND BOASTFUL COMPANY OF HEROES WHEN THE TALE WAS DONE
THEN TOM HID HIMSELF AWAY IN A SHADY NOOK TO SLEEP TILL NOON AND THE
OTHER PIRATES GOT READY TO FISH AND EXPLORE
CHAPTER XVI
AFTER DINNER ALL THE GANG TURNED OUT TO HUNT FOR TURTLE EGGS ON THE BAR
THEY WENT ABOUT POKING STICKS INTO THE SAND AND WHEN THEY FOUND A SOFT
PLACE THEY WENT DOWN ON THEIR KNEES AND DUG WITH THEIR HANDS
SOMETIMES
THEY WOULD TAKE FIFTY OR SIXTY EGGS OUT OF ONE HOLE
THEY WERE PERFECTLY
ROUND WHITE THINGS A TRIFLE SMALLER THAN AN ENGLISH WALNUT
THEY HAD A
FAMOUS FRIED EGG FEAST THAT NIGHT AND ANOTHER ON FRIDAY MORNING
AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT WHOOPING AND PRANCING OUT ON THE BAR AND
CHASED EACH OTHER ROUND AND ROUND SHEDDING CLOTHES AS THEY WENT UNTIL
THEY WERE NAKED AND THEN CONTINUED THE FROLIC FAR AWAY UP THE SHOAL
WATER OF THE BAR AGAINST THE STIFF CURRENT WHICH LATTER TRIPPED THEIR
LEGS FROM UNDER THEM FROM TIME TO TIME AND GREATLY INCREASED THE FUN
AND NOW AND THEN THEY STOOPED IN A GROUP AND SPLASHED WATER IN EACH
OTHER'S FACES WITH THEIR PALMS GRADUALLY APPROACHING EACH OTHER WITH
AVERTED FACES TO AVOID THE STRANGLING SPRAYS AND FINALLY GRIPPING AND
STRUGGLING TILL THE BEST MAN DUCKED HIS NEIGHBOR AND THEN THEY ALL
WENT UNDER IN A TANGLE OF WHITE LEGS AND ARMS AND CAME UP BLOWING
SPUTTERING LAUGHING AND GASPING FOR BREATH AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME
WHEN THEY WERE WELL EXHAUSTED THEY WOULD RUN OUT AND SPRAWL ON THE DRY
HOT SAND AND LIE THERE AND COVER THEMSELVES UP WITH IT AND BY AND BY
BREAK FOR THE WATER AGAIN AND GO THROUGH THE ORIGINAL PERFORMANCE ONCE
MORE
FINALLY IT OCCURRED TO THEM THAT THEIR NAKED SKIN REPRESENTED
FLESH COLORED TIGHTS VERY FAIRLY SO THEY DREW A RING IN THE SAND AND
HAD A CIRCUS WITH THREE CLOWNS IN IT FOR NONE WOULD YIELD THIS PROUDEST
POST TO HIS NEIGHBOR
NEXT THEY GOT THEIR MARBLES AND PLAYED KNUCKS AND RINGTAW AND
KEEPS TILL THAT AMUSEMENT GREW STALE
THEN JOE AND HUCK HAD ANOTHER
SWIM BUT TOM WOULD NOT VENTURE BECAUSE HE FOUND THAT IN KICKING OFF
HIS TROUSERS HE HAD KICKED HIS STRING OF RATTLESNAKE RATTLES OFF HIS
ANKLE AND HE WONDERED HOW HE HAD ESCAPED CRAMP SO LONG WITHOUT THE
PROTECTION OF THIS MYSTERIOUS CHARM
HE DID NOT VENTURE AGAIN UNTIL HE
HAD FOUND IT AND BY THAT TIME THE OTHER BOYS WERE TIRED AND READY TO
REST
THEY GRADUALLY WANDERED APART DROPPED INTO THE DUMPS AND
FELL TO GAZING LONGINGLY ACROSS THE WIDE RIVER TO WHERE THE VILLAGE LAY
DROWSING IN THE SUN
TOM FOUND HIMSELF WRITING BECKY IN THE SAND WITH
HIS BIG TOE HE SCRATCHED IT OUT AND WAS ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR HIS
WEAKNESS
BUT HE WROTE IT AGAIN NEVERTHELESS HE COULD NOT HELP IT
HE
ERASED IT ONCE MORE AND THEN TOOK HIMSELF OUT OF TEMPTATION BY DRIVING
THE OTHER BOYS TOGETHER AND JOINING THEM
BUT JOE'S SPIRITS HAD GONE DOWN ALMOST BEYOND RESURRECTION
HE WAS SO
HOMESICK THAT HE COULD HARDLY ENDURE THE MISERY OF IT
THE TEARS LAY
VERY NEAR THE SURFACE
HUCK WAS MELANCHOLY TOO
TOM WAS DOWNHEARTED
BUT TRIED HARD NOT TO SHOW IT
HE HAD A SECRET WHICH HE WAS NOT READY
TO TELL YET BUT IF THIS MUTINOUS DEPRESSION WAS NOT BROKEN UP SOON HE
WOULD HAVE TO BRING IT OUT
HE SAID WITH A GREAT SHOW OF CHEERFULNESS
I BET THERE'S BEEN PIRATES ON THIS ISLAND BEFORE BOYS
WE'LL EXPLORE
IT AGAIN
THEY'VE HID TREASURES HERE SOMEWHERE
HOW'D YOU FEEL TO LIGHT
ON A ROTTEN CHEST FULL OF GOLD AND SILVER HEY
BUT IT ROUSED ONLY FAINT ENTHUSIASM WHICH FADED OUT WITH NO REPLY
TOM TRIED ONE OR TWO OTHER SEDUCTIONS BUT THEY FAILED TOO
IT WAS
DISCOURAGING WORK
JOE SAT POKING UP THE SAND WITH A STICK AND LOOKING
VERY GLOOMY
FINALLY HE SAID
OH BOYS LET'S GIVE IT UP
I WANT TO GO HOME
IT'S SO LONESOME
OH NO JOE YOU'LL FEEL BETTER BY AND BY SAID TOM
JUST THINK OF THE
FISHING THAT'S HERE
I DON'T CARE FOR FISHING
I WANT TO GO HOME
BUT JOE THERE AIN'T SUCH ANOTHER SWIMMING PLACE ANYWHERE
SWIMMING'S NO GOOD
I DON'T SEEM TO CARE FOR IT SOMEHOW WHEN THERE
AIN'T ANYBODY TO SAY I SHA'N'T GO IN
I MEAN TO GO HOME
OH SHUCKS BABY YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR MOTHER I RECKON
YES I DO WANT TO SEE MY MOTHER AND YOU WOULD TOO IF YOU HAD ONE
I
AIN'T ANY MORE BABY THAN YOU ARE AND JOE SNUFFLED A LITTLE
WELL WE'LL LET THE CRYBABY GO HOME TO HIS MOTHER WON'T WE HUCK POOR
THING DOES IT WANT TO SEE ITS MOTHER AND SO IT SHALL
YOU LIKE IT HERE
DON'T YOU HUCK WE'LL STAY WON'T WE
HUCK SAID Y E S WITHOUT ANY HEART IN IT
I'LL NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE SAID JOE RISING
THERE NOW AND HE MOVED MOODILY AWAY AND BEGAN TO DRESS HIMSELF
WHO CARES SAID TOM
NOBODY WANTS YOU TO
GO 'LONG HOME AND GET
LAUGHED AT
OH YOU'RE A NICE PIRATE
HUCK AND ME AIN'T CRYBABIES
WE'LL
STAY WON'T WE HUCK LET HIM GO IF HE WANTS TO
I RECKON WE CAN GET
ALONG WITHOUT HIM PER'APS
BUT TOM WAS UNEASY NEVERTHELESS AND WAS ALARMED TO SEE JOE GO SULLENLY
ON WITH HIS DRESSING
AND THEN IT WAS DISCOMFORTING TO SEE HUCK EYING
JOE'S PREPARATIONS SO WISTFULLY AND KEEPING UP SUCH AN OMINOUS SILENCE
PRESENTLY WITHOUT A PARTING WORD JOE BEGAN TO WADE OFF TOWARD THE
ILLINOIS SHORE
TOM'S HEART BEGAN TO SINK
HE GLANCED AT HUCK
HUCK
COULD NOT BEAR THE LOOK AND DROPPED HIS EYES
THEN HE SAID
I WANT TO GO TOO TOM
IT WAS GETTING SO LONESOME ANYWAY AND NOW
IT'LL BE WORSE
LET'S US GO TOO TOM
I WON'T YOU CAN ALL GO IF YOU WANT TO
I MEAN TO STAY
TOM I BETTER GO
WELL GO 'LONG WHO'S HENDERING YOU
HUCK BEGAN TO PICK UP HIS SCATTERED CLOTHES
HE SAID
TOM I WISHT YOU'D COME TOO
NOW YOU THINK IT OVER
WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU
WHEN WE GET TO SHORE
WELL YOU'LL WAIT A BLAME LONG TIME THAT'S ALL
HUCK STARTED SORROWFULLY AWAY AND TOM STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM WITH A
STRONG DESIRE TUGGING AT HIS HEART TO YIELD HIS PRIDE AND GO ALONG
TOO
HE HOPED THE BOYS WOULD STOP BUT THEY STILL WADED SLOWLY ON
IT
SUDDENLY DAWNED ON TOM THAT IT WAS BECOME VERY LONELY AND STILL
HE MADE
ONE FINAL STRUGGLE WITH HIS PRIDE AND THEN DARTED AFTER HIS COMRADES
YELLING
WAIT WAIT I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
THEY PRESENTLY STOPPED AND TURNED AROUND
WHEN HE GOT TO WHERE THEY
WERE HE BEGAN UNFOLDING HIS SECRET AND THEY LISTENED MOODILY TILL
AT LAST THEY SAW THE POINT HE WAS DRIVING AT AND THEN THEY SET UP A
WARWHOOP OF APPLAUSE AND SAID IT WAS SPLENDID AND SAID IF HE HAD
TOLD THEM AT FIRST THEY WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED AWAY
HE MADE A PLAUSIBLE
EXCUSE BUT HIS REAL REASON HAD BEEN THE FEAR THAT NOT EVEN THE SECRET
WOULD KEEP THEM WITH HIM ANY VERY GREAT LENGTH OF TIME AND SO HE HAD
MEANT TO HOLD IT IN RESERVE AS A LAST SEDUCTION
THE LADS CAME GAYLY BACK AND WENT AT THEIR SPORTS AGAIN WITH A WILL
CHATTERING ALL THE TIME ABOUT TOM'S STUPENDOUS PLAN AND ADMIRING THE
GENIUS OF IT
AFTER A DAINTY EGG AND FISH DINNER TOM SAID HE WANTED TO
LEARN TO SMOKE NOW
JOE CAUGHT AT THE IDEA AND SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO
TRY TOO
SO HUCK MADE PIPES AND FILLED THEM
THESE NOVICES HAD NEVER
SMOKED ANYTHING BEFORE BUT CIGARS MADE OF GRAPEVINE AND THEY BIT THE
TONGUE AND WERE NOT CONSIDERED MANLY ANYWAY
NOW THEY STRETCHED THEMSELVES OUT ON THEIR ELBOWS AND BEGAN TO PUFF
CHARILY AND WITH SLENDER CONFIDENCE
THE SMOKE HAD AN UNPLEASANT TASTE
AND THEY GAGGED A LITTLE BUT TOM SAID
WHY IT'S JUST AS EASY IF I'D A KNOWED THIS WAS ALL I'D A LEARNT LONG
AGO
SO WOULD I SAID JOE
IT'S JUST NOTHING
WHY MANY A TIME I'VE LOOKED AT PEOPLE SMOKING AND THOUGHT WELL I WISH
I COULD DO THAT BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD SAID TOM
THAT'S JUST THE WAY WITH ME HAIN'T IT HUCK YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK JUST
THAT WAY HAVEN'T YOU HUCK I'LL LEAVE IT TO HUCK IF I HAVEN'T
YES HEAPS OF TIMES SAID HUCK
WELL I HAVE TOO SAID TOM OH HUNDREDS OF TIMES
ONCE DOWN BY THE
SLAUGHTER HOUSE
DON'T YOU REMEMBER HUCK BOB TANNER WAS THERE AND
JOHNNY MILLER AND JEFF THATCHER WHEN I SAID IT
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HUCK 'BOUT ME SAYING THAT
YES THAT'S SO SAID HUCK
THAT WAS THE DAY AFTER I LOST A WHITE
ALLEY
NO 'TWAS THE DAY BEFORE
THERE I TOLD YOU SO SAID TOM
HUCK RECOLLECTS IT
I BLEEVE I COULD SMOKE THIS PIPE ALL DAY SAID JOE
I DON'T FEEL
SICK
NEITHER DO I SAID TOM
I COULD SMOKE IT ALL DAY
BUT I BET YOU JEFF
THATCHER COULDN'T
JEFF THATCHER WHY HE'D KEEL OVER JUST WITH TWO DRAWS
JUST LET HIM
TRY IT ONCE
HE'D SEE
I BET HE WOULD
AND JOHNNY MILLER I WISH COULD SEE JOHNNY MILLER TACKLE
IT ONCE
OH DON'T I SAID JOE
WHY I BET YOU JOHNNY MILLER COULDN'T ANY MORE
DO THIS THAN NOTHING
JUST ONE LITTLE SNIFTER WOULD FETCH HIM
'DEED IT WOULD JOE
SAY I WISH THE BOYS COULD SEE US NOW
SO DO I
SAY BOYS DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND SOME TIME WHEN THEY'RE
AROUND I'LL COME UP TO YOU AND SAY 'JOE GOT A PIPE I WANT A SMOKE
AND YOU'LL SAY KIND OF CARELESS LIKE AS IF IT WARN'T ANYTHING YOU'LL
SAY 'YES I GOT MY OLD PIPE AND ANOTHER ONE BUT MY TOBACKER AIN'T
VERY GOOD AND I'LL SAY 'OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT IF IT'S STRONG
ENOUGH AND THEN YOU'LL OUT WITH THE PIPES AND WE'LL LIGHT UP JUST AS
CA'M AND THEN JUST SEE 'EM LOOK
BY JINGS THAT'LL BE GAY TOM I WISH IT WAS NOW
SO DO I AND WHEN WE TELL 'EM WE LEARNED WHEN WE WAS OFF PIRATING
WON'T THEY WISH THEY'D BEEN ALONG
OH I RECKON NOT I'LL JUST BET THEY WILL
SO THE TALK RAN ON
BUT PRESENTLY IT BEGAN TO FLAG A TRIFLE AND
GROW DISJOINTED
THE SILENCES WIDENED THE EXPECTORATION MARVELLOUSLY
INCREASED
EVERY PORE INSIDE THE BOYS' CHEEKS BECAME A SPOUTING
FOUNTAIN THEY COULD SCARCELY BAIL OUT THE CELLARS UNDER THEIR TONGUES
FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT AN INUNDATION LITTLE OVERFLOWINGS DOWN THEIR
THROATS OCCURRED IN SPITE OF ALL THEY COULD DO AND SUDDEN RETCHINGS
FOLLOWED EVERY TIME
BOTH BOYS WERE LOOKING VERY PALE AND MISERABLE
NOW
JOE'S PIPE DROPPED FROM HIS NERVELESS FINGERS
TOM'S FOLLOWED
BOTH
FOUNTAINS WERE GOING FURIOUSLY AND BOTH PUMPS BAILING WITH MIGHT AND
MAIN
JOE SAID FEEBLY
I'VE LOST MY KNIFE
I RECKON I BETTER GO AND FIND IT
TOM SAID WITH QUIVERING LIPS AND HALTING UTTERANCE
I'LL HELP YOU
YOU GO OVER THAT WAY AND I'LL HUNT AROUND BY THE SPRING
NO YOU NEEDN'T COME HUCK WE CAN FIND IT
SO HUCK SAT DOWN AGAIN AND WAITED AN HOUR
THEN HE FOUND IT LONESOME
AND WENT TO FIND HIS COMRADES
THEY WERE WIDE APART IN THE WOODS BOTH
VERY PALE BOTH FAST ASLEEP
BUT SOMETHING INFORMED HIM THAT IF THEY HAD
HAD ANY TROUBLE THEY HAD GOT RID OF IT
THEY WERE NOT TALKATIVE AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT
THEY HAD A HUMBLE LOOK
AND WHEN HUCK PREPARED HIS PIPE AFTER THE MEAL AND WAS GOING TO PREPARE
THEIRS THEY SAID NO THEY WERE NOT FEELING VERY WELL SOMETHING THEY ATE
AT DINNER HAD DISAGREED WITH THEM
ABOUT MIDNIGHT JOE AWOKE AND CALLED THE BOYS
THERE WAS A BROODING
OPPRESSIVENESS IN THE AIR THAT SEEMED TO BODE SOMETHING
THE BOYS
HUDDLED THEMSELVES TOGETHER AND SOUGHT THE FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP OF
THE FIRE THOUGH THE DULL DEAD HEAT OF THE BREATHLESS ATMOSPHERE WAS
STIFLING
THEY SAT STILL INTENT AND WAITING
THE SOLEMN HUSH CONTINUED
BEYOND THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE EVERYTHING WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE
BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS
PRESENTLY THERE CAME A QUIVERING GLOW THAT
VAGUELY REVEALED THE FOLIAGE FOR A MOMENT AND THEN VANISHED
BY AND BY
ANOTHER CAME A LITTLE STRONGER
THEN ANOTHER
THEN A FAINT MOAN CAME
SIGHING THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE FOREST AND THE BOYS FELT A FLEETING
BREATH UPON THEIR CHEEKS AND SHUDDERED WITH THE FANCY THAT THE SPIRIT
OF THE NIGHT HAD GONE BY
THERE WAS A PAUSE
NOW A WEIRD FLASH TURNED
NIGHT INTO DAY AND SHOWED EVERY LITTLE GRASSBLADE SEPARATE AND
DISTINCT THAT GREW ABOUT THEIR FEET
AND IT SHOWED THREE WHITE
STARTLED FACES TOO
A DEEP PEAL OF THUNDER WENT ROLLING AND TUMBLING
DOWN THE HEAVENS AND LOST ITSELF IN SULLEN RUMBLINGS IN THE DISTANCE
A
SWEEP OF CHILLY AIR PASSED BY RUSTLING ALL THE LEAVES AND SNOWING THE
FLAKY ASHES BROADCAST ABOUT THE FIRE
ANOTHER FIERCE GLARE LIT UP THE
FOREST AND AN INSTANT CRASH FOLLOWED THAT SEEMED TO REND THE TREETOPS
RIGHT OVER THE BOYS' HEADS
THEY CLUNG TOGETHER IN TERROR IN THE THICK
GLOOM THAT FOLLOWED
A FEW BIG RAINDROPS FELL PATTERING UPON THE LEAVES
QUICK BOYS GO FOR THE TENT EXCLAIMED TOM
THEY SPRANG AWAY STUMBLING OVER ROOTS AND AMONG VINES IN THE DARK NO
TWO PLUNGING IN THE SAME DIRECTION
A FURIOUS BLAST ROARED THROUGH
THE TREES MAKING EVERYTHING SING AS IT WENT
ONE BLINDING FLASH AFTER
ANOTHER CAME AND PEAL ON PEAL OF DEAFENING THUNDER
AND NOW A DRENCHING
RAIN POURED DOWN AND THE RISING HURRICANE DROVE IT IN SHEETS ALONG THE
GROUND
THE BOYS CRIED OUT TO EACH OTHER BUT THE ROARING WIND AND THE
BOOMING THUNDERBLASTS DROWNED THEIR VOICES UTTERLY
HOWEVER ONE BY ONE
THEY STRAGGLED IN AT LAST AND TOOK SHELTER UNDER THE TENT COLD SCARED
AND STREAMING WITH WATER BUT TO HAVE COMPANY IN MISERY SEEMED SOMETHING
TO BE GRATEFUL FOR
THEY COULD NOT TALK THE OLD SAIL FLAPPED SO
FURIOUSLY EVEN IF THE OTHER NOISES WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THEM
THE TEMPEST
ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER AND PRESENTLY THE SAIL TORE LOOSE FROM ITS
FASTENINGS AND WENT WINGING AWAY ON THE BLAST
THE BOYS SEIZED EACH
OTHERS' HANDS AND FLED WITH MANY TUMBLINGS AND BRUISES TO THE SHELTER
OF A GREAT OAK THAT STOOD UPON THE RIVERBANK
NOW THE BATTLE WAS AT ITS
HIGHEST
UNDER THE CEASELESS CONFLAGRATION OF LIGHTNING THAT FLAMED
IN THE SKIES EVERYTHING BELOW STOOD OUT IN CLEANCUT AND SHADOWLESS
DISTINCTNESS THE BENDING TREES THE BILLOWY RIVER WHITE WITH FOAM THE
DRIVING SPRAY OF SPUMEFLAKES THE DIM OUTLINES OF THE HIGH BLUFFS ON
THE OTHER SIDE GLIMPSED THROUGH THE DRIFTING CLOUDRACK AND THE SLANTING
VEIL OF RAIN
EVERY LITTLE WHILE SOME GIANT TREE YIELDED THE FIGHT
AND FELL CRASHING THROUGH THE YOUNGER GROWTH AND THE UNFLAGGING
THUNDERPEALS CAME NOW IN EAR SPLITTING EXPLOSIVE BURSTS KEEN AND SHARP
AND UNSPEAKABLY APPALLING
THE STORM CULMINATED IN ONE MATCHLESS EFFORT
THAT SEEMED LIKELY TO TEAR THE ISLAND TO PIECES BURN IT UP DROWN IT TO
THE TREETOPS BLOW IT AWAY AND DEAFEN EVERY CREATURE IN IT ALL AT ONE
AND THE SAME MOMENT
IT WAS A WILD NIGHT FOR HOMELESS YOUNG HEADS TO BE
OUT IN
BUT AT LAST THE BATTLE WAS DONE AND THE FORCES RETIRED WITH WEAKER AND
WEAKER THREATENINGS AND GRUMBLINGS AND PEACE RESUMED HER SWAY
THE
BOYS WENT BACK TO CAMP A GOOD DEAL AWED BUT THEY FOUND THERE WAS STILL
SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR BECAUSE THE GREAT SYCAMORE THE SHELTER
OF THEIR BEDS WAS A RUIN NOW BLASTED BY THE LIGHTNINGS AND THEY WERE
NOT UNDER IT WHEN THE CATASTROPHE HAPPENED
EVERYTHING IN CAMP WAS DRENCHED THE CAMPFIRE AS WELL FOR THEY WERE BUT
HEEDLESS LADS LIKE THEIR GENERATION AND HAD MADE NO PROVISION AGAINST
RAIN
HERE WAS MATTER FOR DISMAY FOR THEY WERE SOAKED THROUGH AND
CHILLED
THEY WERE ELOQUENT IN THEIR DISTRESS BUT THEY PRESENTLY
DISCOVERED THAT THE FIRE HAD EATEN SO FAR UP UNDER THE GREAT LOG IT HAD
BEEN BUILT AGAINST WHERE IT CURVED UPWARD AND SEPARATED ITSELF FROM
THE GROUND THAT A HANDBREADTH OR SO OF IT HAD ESCAPED WETTING SO THEY
PATIENTLY WROUGHT UNTIL WITH SHREDS AND BARK GATHERED FROM THE UNDER
SIDES OF SHELTERED LOGS THEY COAXED THE FIRE TO BURN AGAIN
THEN THEY
PILED ON GREAT DEAD BOUGHS TILL THEY HAD A ROARING FURNACE AND WERE
GLADHEARTED ONCE MORE
THEY DRIED THEIR BOILED HAM AND HAD A FEAST
AND AFTER THAT THEY SAT BY THE FIRE AND EXPANDED AND GLORIFIED THEIR
MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE UNTIL MORNING FOR THERE WAS NOT A DRY SPOT TO SLEEP
ON ANYWHERE AROUND
AS THE SUN BEGAN TO STEAL IN UPON THE BOYS DROWSINESS CAME OVER
THEM AND THEY WENT OUT ON THE SANDBAR AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
THEY GOT
SCORCHED OUT BY AND BY AND DREARILY SET ABOUT GETTING BREAKFAST
AFTER
THE MEAL THEY FELT RUSTY AND STIFF JOINTED AND A LITTLE HOMESICK ONCE
MORE
TOM SAW THE SIGNS AND FELL TO CHEERING UP THE PIRATES AS WELL AS
HE COULD
BUT THEY CARED NOTHING FOR MARBLES OR CIRCUS OR SWIMMING OR
ANYTHING
HE REMINDED THEM OF THE IMPOSING SECRET AND RAISED A RAY OF
CHEER
WHILE IT LASTED HE GOT THEM INTERESTED IN A NEW DEVICE
THIS WAS
TO KNOCK OFF BEING PIRATES FOR A WHILE AND BE INDIANS FOR A CHANGE
THEY WERE ATTRACTED BY THIS IDEA SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY WERE
STRIPPED AND STRIPED FROM HEAD TO HEEL WITH BLACK MUD LIKE SO MANY
ZEBRAS ALL OF THEM CHIEFS OF COURSE AND THEN THEY WENT TEARING THROUGH
THE WOODS TO ATTACK AN ENGLISH SETTLEMENT
BY AND BY THEY SEPARATED INTO THREE HOSTILE TRIBES AND DARTED UPON EACH
OTHER FROM AMBUSH WITH DREADFUL WARWHOOPS AND KILLED AND SCALPED EACH
OTHER BY THOUSANDS
IT WAS A GORY DAY
CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS AN EXTREMELY
SATISFACTORY ONE
THEY ASSEMBLED IN CAMP TOWARD SUPPERTIME HUNGRY AND HAPPY BUT NOW
A DIFFICULTY AROSE HOSTILE INDIANS COULD NOT BREAK THE BREAD OF
HOSPITALITY TOGETHER WITHOUT FIRST MAKING PEACE AND THIS WAS A SIMPLE
IMPOSSIBILITY WITHOUT SMOKING A PIPE OF PEACE
THERE WAS NO OTHER
PROCESS THAT EVER THEY HAD HEARD OF
TWO OF THE SAVAGES ALMOST WISHED
THEY HAD REMAINED PIRATES
HOWEVER THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY SO WITH SUCH
SHOW OF CHEERFULNESS AS THEY COULD MUSTER THEY CALLED FOR THE PIPE AND
TOOK THEIR WHIFF AS IT PASSED IN DUE FORM
AND BEHOLD THEY WERE GLAD THEY HAD GONE INTO SAVAGERY FOR THEY HAD
GAINED SOMETHING THEY FOUND THAT THEY COULD NOW SMOKE A LITTLE WITHOUT
HAVING TO GO AND HUNT FOR A LOST KNIFE THEY DID NOT GET SICK ENOUGH TO
BE SERIOUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE
THEY WERE NOT LIKELY TO FOOL AWAY THIS HIGH
PROMISE FOR LACK OF EFFORT
NO THEY PRACTISED CAUTIOUSLY AFTER SUPPER
WITH RIGHT FAIR SUCCESS AND SO THEY SPENT A JUBILANT EVENING
THEY WERE
PROUDER AND HAPPIER IN THEIR NEW ACQUIREMENT THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN
IN THE SCALPING AND SKINNING OF THE SIX NATIONS
WE WILL LEAVE THEM TO
SMOKE AND CHATTER AND BRAG SINCE WE HAVE NO FURTHER USE FOR THEM AT
PRESENT
CHAPTER XVII
BUT THERE WAS NO HILARITY IN THE LITTLE TOWN THAT SAME TRANQUIL SATURDAY
AFTERNOON
THE HARPERS AND AUNT POLLY'S FAMILY WERE BEING PUT INTO
MOURNING WITH GREAT GRIEF AND MANY TEARS
AN UNUSUAL QUIET POSSESSED
THE VILLAGE ALTHOUGH IT WAS ORDINARILY QUIET ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE
THE VILLAGERS CONDUCTED THEIR CONCERNS WITH AN ABSENT AIR AND TALKED
LITTLE BUT THEY SIGHED OFTEN
THE SATURDAY HOLIDAY SEEMED A BURDEN TO
THE CHILDREN
THEY HAD NO HEART IN THEIR SPORTS AND GRADUALLY GAVE THEM
UP
IN THE AFTERNOON BECKY THATCHER FOUND HERSELF MOPING ABOUT THE DESERTED
SCHOOLHOUSE YARD AND FEELING VERY MELANCHOLY
BUT SHE FOUND NOTHING
THERE TO COMFORT HER
SHE SOLILOQUIZED
OH IF I ONLY HAD A BRASS ANDIRON KNOB AGAIN BUT I HAVEN'T GOT
ANYTHING NOW TO REMEMBER HIM BY AND SHE CHOKED BACK A LITTLE SOB
PRESENTLY SHE STOPPED AND SAID TO HERSELF
IT WAS RIGHT HERE
OH IF IT WAS TO DO OVER AGAIN I WOULDN'T SAY
THAT I WOULDN'T SAY IT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD
BUT HE'S GONE NOW I'LL
NEVER NEVER NEVER SEE HIM ANY MORE
THIS THOUGHT BROKE HER DOWN AND SHE WANDERED AWAY WITH TEARS ROLLING
DOWN HER CHEEKS
THEN QUITE A GROUP OF BOYS AND GIRLS PLAYMATES OF TOM'S
AND JOE'S CAME BY AND STOOD LOOKING OVER THE PALING FENCE AND TALKING
IN REVERENT TONES OF HOW TOM DID SO AND SO THE LAST TIME THEY SAW
HIM AND HOW JOE SAID THIS AND THAT SMALL TRIFLE PREGNANT WITH AWFUL
PROPHECY AS THEY COULD EASILY SEE NOW AND EACH SPEAKER POINTED OUT
THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE LOST LADS STOOD AT THE TIME AND THEN ADDED
SOMETHING LIKE AND I WAS A STANDING JUST SO JUST AS I AM NOW AND AS IF
YOU WAS HIM I WAS AS CLOSE AS THAT AND HE SMILED JUST THIS WAY AND THEN
SOMETHING SEEMED TO GO ALL OVER ME LIKE AWFUL YOU KNOW AND I NEVER
THOUGHT WHAT IT MEANT OF COURSE BUT I CAN SEE NOW
THEN THERE WAS A DISPUTE ABOUT WHO SAW THE DEAD BOYS LAST IN LIFE AND
MANY CLAIMED THAT DISMAL DISTINCTION AND OFFERED EVIDENCES MORE OR
LESS TAMPERED WITH BY THE WITNESS AND WHEN IT WAS ULTIMATELY DECIDED
WHO DID SEE THE DEPARTED LAST AND EXCHANGED THE LAST WORDS WITH THEM
THE LUCKY PARTIES TOOK UPON THEMSELVES A SORT OF SACRED IMPORTANCE
AND WERE GAPED AT AND ENVIED BY ALL THE REST
ONE POOR CHAP WHO HAD
NO OTHER GRANDEUR TO OFFER SAID WITH TOLERABLY MANIFEST PRIDE IN THE
REMEMBRANCE
WELL TOM SAWYER HE LICKED ME ONCE
BUT THAT BID FOR GLORY WAS A FAILURE
MOST OF THE BOYS COULD SAY THAT
AND SO THAT CHEAPENED THE DISTINCTION TOO MUCH
THE GROUP LOITERED AWAY
STILL RECALLING MEMORIES OF THE LOST HEROES IN AWED VOICES
WHEN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL HOUR WAS FINISHED THE NEXT MORNING THE BELL
BEGAN TO TOLL INSTEAD OF RINGING IN THE USUAL WAY
IT WAS A VERY STILL
SABBATH AND THE MOURNFUL SOUND SEEMED IN KEEPING WITH THE MUSING HUSH
THAT LAY UPON NATURE
THE VILLAGERS BEGAN TO GATHER LOITERING A MOMENT
IN THE VESTIBULE TO CONVERSE IN WHISPERS ABOUT THE SAD EVENT
BUT THERE
WAS NO WHISPERING IN THE HOUSE ONLY THE FUNEREAL RUSTLING OF DRESSES
AS THE WOMEN GATHERED TO THEIR SEATS DISTURBED THE SILENCE THERE
NONE
COULD REMEMBER WHEN THE LITTLE CHURCH HAD BEEN SO FULL BEFORE
THERE
WAS FINALLY A WAITING PAUSE AN EXPECTANT DUMBNESS AND THEN AUNT POLLY
ENTERED FOLLOWED BY SID AND MARY AND THEY BY THE HARPER FAMILY ALL IN
DEEP BLACK AND THE WHOLE CONGREGATION THE OLD MINISTER AS WELL ROSE
REVERENTLY AND STOOD UNTIL THE MOURNERS WERE SEATED IN THE FRONT PEW
THERE WAS ANOTHER COMMUNING SILENCE BROKEN AT INTERVALS BY MUFFLED
SOBS AND THEN THE MINISTER SPREAD HIS HANDS ABROAD AND PRAYED
A MOVING
HYMN WAS SUNG AND THE TEXT FOLLOWED I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE
LIFE
AS THE SERVICE PROCEEDED THE CLERGYMAN DREW SUCH PICTURES OF THE
GRACES THE WINNING WAYS AND THE RARE PROMISE OF THE LOST LADS THAT
EVERY SOUL THERE THINKING HE RECOGNIZED THESE PICTURES FELT A PANG
IN REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD PERSISTENTLY BLINDED HIMSELF TO THEM ALWAYS
BEFORE AND HAD AS PERSISTENTLY SEEN ONLY FAULTS AND FLAWS IN THE POOR
BOYS
THE MINISTER RELATED MANY A TOUCHING INCIDENT IN THE LIVES OF THE
DEPARTED TOO WHICH ILLUSTRATED THEIR SWEET GENEROUS NATURES AND THE
PEOPLE COULD EASILY SEE NOW HOW NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL THOSE EPISODES
WERE AND REMEMBERED WITH GRIEF THAT AT THE TIME THEY OCCURRED THEY HAD
SEEMED RANK RASCALITIES WELL DESERVING OF THE COWHIDE
THE CONGREGATION
BECAME MORE AND MORE MOVED AS THE PATHETIC TALE WENT ON TILL AT LAST
THE WHOLE COMPANY BROKE DOWN AND JOINED THE WEEPING MOURNERS IN A CHORUS
OF ANGUISHED SOBS THE PREACHER HIMSELF GIVING WAY TO HIS FEELINGS AND
CRYING IN THE PULPIT
THERE WAS A RUSTLE IN THE GALLERY WHICH NOBODY NOTICED A MOMENT LATER
THE CHURCH DOOR CREAKED THE MINISTER RAISED HIS STREAMING EYES ABOVE
HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND STOOD TRANSFIXED FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER PAIR
OF EYES FOLLOWED THE MINISTER'S AND THEN ALMOST WITH ONE IMPULSE THE
CONGREGATION ROSE AND STARED WHILE THE THREE DEAD BOYS CAME MARCHING UP
THE AISLE TOM IN THE LEAD JOE NEXT AND HUCK A RUIN OF DROOPING RAGS
SNEAKING SHEEPISHLY IN THE REAR THEY HAD BEEN HID IN THE UNUSED GALLERY
LISTENING TO THEIR OWN FUNERAL SERMON
AUNT POLLY MARY AND THE HARPERS THREW THEMSELVES UPON THEIR RESTORED
ONES SMOTHERED THEM WITH KISSES AND POURED OUT THANKSGIVINGS WHILE
POOR HUCK STOOD ABASHED AND UNCOMFORTABLE NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT
TO DO OR WHERE TO HIDE FROM SO MANY UNWELCOMING EYES
HE WAVERED AND
STARTED TO SLINK AWAY BUT TOM SEIZED HIM AND SAID
AUNT POLLY IT AIN'T FAIR
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO BE GLAD TO SEE HUCK
AND SO THEY SHALL
I'M GLAD TO SEE HIM POOR MOTHERLESS THING AND
THE LOVING ATTENTIONS AUNT POLLY LAVISHED UPON HIM WERE THE ONE THING
CAPABLE OF MAKING HIM MORE UNCOMFORTABLE THAN HE WAS BEFORE
SUDDENLY THE MINISTER SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE PRAISE GOD FROM
WHOM ALL BLESSINGS FLOW SING AND PUT YOUR HEARTS IN IT
AND THEY DID
OLD HUNDRED SWELLED UP WITH A TRIUMPHANT BURST AND
WHILE IT SHOOK THE RAFTERS TOM SAWYER THE PIRATE LOOKED AROUND UPON THE
ENVYING JUVENILES ABOUT HIM AND CONFESSED IN HIS HEART THAT THIS WAS THE
PROUDEST MOMENT OF HIS LIFE
AS THE SOLD CONGREGATION TROOPED OUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD ALMOST BE
WILLING TO BE MADE RIDICULOUS AGAIN TO HEAR OLD HUNDRED SUNG LIKE THAT
ONCE MORE
TOM GOT MORE CUFFS AND KISSES THAT DAY ACCORDING TO AUNT POLLY'S VARYING
MOODS THAN HE HAD EARNED BEFORE IN A YEAR AND HE HARDLY KNEW WHICH
EXPRESSED THE MOST GRATEFULNESS TO GOD AND AFFECTION FOR HIMSELF
CHAPTER XVIII
THAT WAS TOM'S GREAT SECRET THE SCHEME TO RETURN HOME WITH HIS BROTHER
PIRATES AND ATTEND THEIR OWN FUNERALS
THEY HAD PADDLED OVER TO THE
MISSOURI SHORE ON A LOG AT DUSK ON SATURDAY LANDING FIVE OR SIX MILES
BELOW THE VILLAGE THEY HAD SLEPT IN THE WOODS AT THE EDGE OF THE TOWN
TILL NEARLY DAYLIGHT AND HAD THEN CREPT THROUGH BACK LANES AND ALLEYS
AND FINISHED THEIR SLEEP IN THE GALLERY OF THE CHURCH AMONG A CHAOS OF
INVALIDED BENCHES
AT BREAKFAST MONDAY MORNING AUNT POLLY AND MARY WERE VERY LOVING TO
TOM AND VERY ATTENTIVE TO HIS WANTS
THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF
TALK
IN THE COURSE OF IT AUNT POLLY SAID
WELL I DON'T SAY IT WASN'T A FINE JOKE TOM TO KEEP EVERYBODY
SUFFERING 'MOST A WEEK SO YOU BOYS HAD A GOOD TIME BUT IT IS A PITY YOU
COULD BE SO HARD HEARTED AS TO LET ME SUFFER SO
IF YOU COULD COME OVER
ON A LOG TO GO TO YOUR FUNERAL YOU COULD HAVE COME OVER AND GIVE ME A
HINT SOME WAY THAT YOU WARN'T DEAD BUT ONLY RUN OFF
YES YOU COULD HAVE DONE THAT TOM SAID MARY AND I BELIEVE YOU

I WELL I DON'T KNOW
'TWOULD 'A' SPOILED EVERYTHING
TOM I HOPED YOU LOVED ME THAT MUCH SAID AUNT POLLY WITH A GRIEVED
TONE THAT DISCOMFORTED THE BOY

CARED ENOUGH TO THINK OF IT EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT
NOW AUNTIE THAT AIN'T ANY HARM PLEADED MARY IT'S ONLY TOM'S GIDDY
WAY HE IS ALWAYS IN SUCH A RUSH THAT HE NEVER THINKS OF ANYTHING
MORE'S THE PITY
SID WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
AND SID WOULD HAVE COME AND
DONE IT TOO
TOM YOU'LL LOOK BACK SOME DAY WHEN IT'S TOO LATE
AND WISH YOU'D CARED A LITTLE MORE FOR ME WHEN IT WOULD HAVE COST YOU SO
LITTLE
NOW AUNTIE YOU KNOW I DO CARE FOR YOU SAID TOM
I'D KNOW IT BETTER IF YOU ACTED MORE LIKE IT
I WISH NOW I'D THOUGHT SAID TOM WITH A REPENTANT TONE BUT I DREAMT
ABOUT YOU ANYWAY
THAT'S SOMETHING AIN'T IT
IT AIN'T MUCH A CAT DOES THAT MUCH BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING
WHAT
DID YOU DREAM
WHY WEDNESDAY NIGHT I DREAMT THAT YOU WAS SITTING OVER THERE BY THE
BED AND SID WAS SITTING BY THE WOODBOX AND MARY NEXT TO HIM
WELL SO WE DID
SO WE ALWAYS DO
I'M GLAD YOUR DREAMS COULD TAKE EVEN
THAT MUCH TROUBLE ABOUT US
AND I DREAMT THAT JOE HARPER'S MOTHER WAS HERE
WHY SHE WAS HERE DID YOU DREAM ANY MORE
OH LOTS

WELL TRY TO RECOLLECT CAN'T YOU
SOMEHOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE WIND THE WIND BLOWED THE THE
TRY HARDER TOM THE WIND DID BLOW SOMETHING
COME
TOM PRESSED HIS FINGERS ON HIS FOREHEAD AN ANXIOUS MINUTE AND THEN
SAID
I'VE GOT IT NOW I'VE GOT IT NOW IT BLOWED THE CANDLE
MERCY ON US GO ON TOM GO ON
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU SAID 'WHY I BELIEVE THAT THAT DOOR
GO ON TOM
JUST LET ME STUDY A MOMENT JUST A MOMENT
OH YES YOU SAID YOU BELIEVED
THE DOOR WAS OPEN
AS I'M SITTING HERE I DID DIDN'T I MARY GO ON
AND THEN AND THEN WELL I WON'T BE CERTAIN BUT IT SEEMS LIKE AS IF YOU
MADE SID GO AND AND
WELL WELL WHAT DID I MAKE HIM DO TOM WHAT DID I MAKE HIM DO
YOU MADE HIM YOU OH YOU MADE HIM SHUT IT
WELL FOR THE LAND'S SAKE I NEVER HEARD THE BEAT OF THAT IN ALL MY
DAYS DON'T TELL ME THERE AIN'T ANYTHING IN DREAMS ANY MORE
SERENY

I'D LIKE TO SEE HER
GET AROUND THIS WITH HER RUBBAGE 'BOUT SUPERSTITION
GO ON TOM
OH IT'S ALL GETTING JUST AS BRIGHT AS DAY NOW
NEXT YOU SAID I WARN'T
BAD ONLY MISCHEEVOUS AND HARUM SCARUM AND NOT ANY MORE RESPONSIBLE
THAN THAN I THINK IT WAS A COLT OR SOMETHING
AND SO IT WAS WELL GOODNESS GRACIOUS GO ON TOM
AND THEN YOU BEGAN TO CRY
SO I DID
SO I DID
NOT THE FIRST TIME NEITHER
AND THEN
THEN MRS
HARPER SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SAID JOE WAS JUST THE SAME AND
SHE WISHED SHE HADN'T WHIPPED HIM FOR TAKING CREAM WHEN SHE'D THROWED IT
OUT HER OWN SELF
TOM THE SPERRIT WAS UPON YOU YOU WAS A PROPHESYING THAT'S WHAT YOU
WAS DOING LAND ALIVE GO ON TOM
THEN SID HE SAID HE SAID
I DON'T THINK I SAID ANYTHING SAID SID
YES YOU DID SID SAID MARY
SHUT YOUR HEADS AND LET TOM GO ON WHAT DID HE SAY TOM
HE SAID I THINK HE SAID HE HOPED I WAS BETTER OFF WHERE I WAS GONE
TO BUT IF I'D BEEN BETTER SOMETIMES
THERE D'YOU HEAR THAT IT WAS HIS VERY WORDS
AND YOU SHUT HIM UP SHARP
I LAY I DID THERE MUST 'A' BEEN AN ANGEL THERE
THERE WAS AN ANGEL
THERE SOMEWHERES
AND MRS
HARPER TOLD ABOUT JOE SCARING HER WITH A FIRECRACKER AND YOU
TOLD ABOUT PETER AND THE PAIN KILLER
JUST AS TRUE AS I LIVE
AND THEN THERE WAS A WHOLE LOT OF TALK 'BOUT DRAGGING THE RIVER FOR US
AND 'BOUT HAVING THE FUNERAL SUNDAY AND THEN YOU AND OLD MISS HARPER
HUGGED AND CRIED AND SHE WENT
IT HAPPENED JUST SO IT HAPPENED JUST SO AS SURE AS I'M A SITTING IN
THESE VERY TRACKS
TOM YOU COULDN'T TOLD IT MORE LIKE IF YOU'D 'A' SEEN
IT AND THEN WHAT GO ON TOM
THEN I THOUGHT YOU PRAYED FOR ME AND I COULD SEE YOU AND HEAR EVERY
WORD YOU SAID
AND YOU WENT TO BED AND I WAS SO SORRY THAT I TOOK AND
WROTE ON A PIECE OF SYCAMORE BARK 'WE AIN'T DEAD WE ARE ONLY OFF BEING
PIRATES AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE BY THE CANDLE AND THEN YOU LOOKED
SO GOOD LAYING THERE ASLEEP THAT I THOUGHT I WENT AND LEANED OVER AND
KISSED YOU ON THE LIPS
DID YOU TOM DID YOU I JUST FORGIVE YOU EVERYTHING FOR THAT AND
SHE SEIZED THE BOY IN A CRUSHING EMBRACE THAT MADE HIM FEEL LIKE THE
GUILTIEST OF VILLAINS
IT WAS VERY KIND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY A DREAM SID SOLILOQUIZED
JUST AUDIBLY
SHUT UP SID A BODY DOES JUST THE SAME IN A DREAM AS HE'D DO IF HE WAS
AWAKE
HERE'S A BIG MILUM APPLE I'VE BEEN SAVING FOR YOU TOM IF YOU
WAS EVER FOUND AGAIN NOW GO 'LONG TO SCHOOL
I'M THANKFUL TO THE GOOD
GOD AND FATHER OF US ALL I'VE GOT YOU BACK THAT'S LONG SUFFERING AND
MERCIFUL TO THEM THAT BELIEVE ON HIM AND KEEP HIS WORD THOUGH GOODNESS
KNOWS I'M UNWORTHY OF IT BUT IF ONLY THE WORTHY ONES GOT HIS BLESSINGS
AND HAD HIS HAND TO HELP THEM OVER THE ROUGH PLACES THERE'S FEW ENOUGH
WOULD SMILE HERE OR EVER ENTER INTO HIS REST WHEN THE LONG NIGHT COMES
GO 'LONG SID MARY TOM TAKE YOURSELVES OFF YOU'VE HENDERED ME LONG
ENOUGH
THE CHILDREN LEFT FOR SCHOOL AND THE OLD LADY TO CALL ON MRS
HARPER
AND VANQUISH HER REALISM WITH TOM'S MARVELLOUS DREAM
SID HAD BETTER
JUDGMENT THAN TO UTTER THE THOUGHT THAT WAS IN HIS MIND AS HE LEFT THE
HOUSE
IT WAS THIS PRETTY THIN AS LONG A DREAM AS THAT WITHOUT ANY
MISTAKES IN IT
WHAT A HERO TOM WAS BECOME NOW HE DID NOT GO SKIPPING AND PRANCING
BUT MOVED WITH A DIGNIFIED SWAGGER AS BECAME A PIRATE WHO FELT THAT THE
PUBLIC EYE WAS ON HIM
AND INDEED IT WAS HE TRIED NOT TO SEEM TO SEE
THE LOOKS OR HEAR THE REMARKS AS HE PASSED ALONG BUT THEY WERE FOOD AND
DRINK TO HIM
SMALLER BOYS THAN HIMSELF FLOCKED AT HIS HEELS AS PROUD
TO BE SEEN WITH HIM AND TOLERATED BY HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN THE DRUMMER
AT THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION OR THE ELEPHANT LEADING A MENAGERIE INTO
TOWN
BOYS OF HIS OWN SIZE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW HE HAD BEEN AWAY AT
ALL BUT THEY WERE CONSUMING WITH ENVY NEVERTHELESS
THEY WOULD HAVE
GIVEN ANYTHING TO HAVE THAT SWARTHY SUN TANNED SKIN OF HIS AND HIS
GLITTERING NOTORIETY AND TOM WOULD NOT HAVE PARTED WITH EITHER FOR A
CIRCUS
AT SCHOOL THE CHILDREN MADE SO MUCH OF HIM AND OF JOE AND DELIVERED
SUCH ELOQUENT ADMIRATION FROM THEIR EYES THAT THE TWO HEROES WERE
NOT LONG IN BECOMING INSUFFERABLY STUCK UP THEY BEGAN TO TELL THEIR
ADVENTURES TO HUNGRY LISTENERS BUT THEY ONLY BEGAN IT WAS NOT A
THING LIKELY TO HAVE AN END WITH IMAGINATIONS LIKE THEIRS TO FURNISH
MATERIAL
AND FINALLY WHEN THEY GOT OUT THEIR PIPES AND WENT SERENELY
PUFFING AROUND THE VERY SUMMIT OF GLORY WAS REACHED
TOM DECIDED THAT HE COULD BE INDEPENDENT OF BECKY THATCHER NOW
GLORY
WAS SUFFICIENT
HE WOULD LIVE FOR GLORY
NOW THAT HE WAS DISTINGUISHED
MAYBE SHE WOULD BE WANTING TO MAKE UP WELL LET HER SHE SHOULD SEE
THAT HE COULD BE AS INDIFFERENT AS SOME OTHER PEOPLE
PRESENTLY SHE
ARRIVED
TOM PRETENDED NOT TO SEE HER
HE MOVED AWAY AND JOINED A GROUP
OF BOYS AND GIRLS AND BEGAN TO TALK
SOON HE OBSERVED THAT SHE WAS
TRIPPING GAYLY BACK AND FORTH WITH FLUSHED FACE AND DANCING EYES
PRETENDING TO BE BUSY CHASING SCHOOLMATES AND SCREAMING WITH LAUGHTER
WHEN SHE MADE A CAPTURE BUT HE NOTICED THAT SHE ALWAYS MADE HER
CAPTURES IN HIS VICINITY AND THAT SHE SEEMED TO CAST A CONSCIOUS EYE
IN HIS DIRECTION AT SUCH TIMES TOO
IT GRATIFIED ALL THE VICIOUS VANITY
THAT WAS IN HIM AND SO INSTEAD OF WINNING HIM IT ONLY SET HIM UP
THE MORE AND MADE HIM THE MORE DILIGENT TO AVOID BETRAYING THAT HE
KNEW SHE WAS ABOUT
PRESENTLY SHE GAVE OVER SKYLARKING AND MOVED
IRRESOLUTELY ABOUT SIGHING ONCE OR TWICE AND GLANCING FURTIVELY AND
WISTFULLY TOWARD TOM
THEN SHE OBSERVED THAT NOW TOM WAS TALKING MORE
PARTICULARLY TO AMY LAWRENCE THAN TO ANY ONE ELSE
SHE FELT A SHARP PANG
AND GREW DISTURBED AND UNEASY AT ONCE
SHE TRIED TO GO AWAY BUT HER
FEET WERE TREACHEROUS AND CARRIED HER TO THE GROUP INSTEAD
SHE SAID TO
A GIRL ALMOST AT TOM'S ELBOW WITH SHAM VIVACITY
WHY MARY AUSTIN YOU BAD GIRL WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO SUNDAY SCHOOL
I DID COME DIDN'T YOU SEE ME
WHY NO DID YOU WHERE DID YOU SIT
I WAS IN MISS PETERS' CLASS WHERE I ALWAYS GO
I SAW YOU
DID YOU WHY IT'S FUNNY I DIDN'T SEE YOU
I WANTED TO TELL YOU ABOUT
THE PICNIC
OH THAT'S JOLLY
WHO'S GOING TO GIVE IT
MY MA'S GOING TO LET ME HAVE ONE
OH GOODY I HOPE SHE'LL LET ME COME
WELL SHE WILL
THE PICNIC'S FOR ME
SHE'LL LET ANYBODY COME THAT I
WANT AND I WANT YOU
THAT'S EVER SO NICE
WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE
BY AND BY
MAYBE ABOUT VACATION
OH WON'T IT BE FUN YOU GOING TO HAVE ALL THE GIRLS AND BOYS
YES EVERY ONE THAT'S FRIENDS TO ME OR WANTS TO BE AND SHE GLANCED
EVER SO FURTIVELY AT TOM BUT HE TALKED RIGHT ALONG TO AMY LAWRENCE
ABOUT THE TERRIBLE STORM ON THE ISLAND AND HOW THE LIGHTNING TORE THE
GREAT SYCAMORE TREE ALL TO FLINDERS WHILE HE WAS STANDING WITHIN
THREE FEET OF IT
OH MAY I COME SAID GRACE MILLER
YES
AND ME SAID SALLY ROGERS
YES
AND ME TOO SAID SUSY HARPER
AND JOE
YES
AND SO ON WITH CLAPPING OF JOYFUL HANDS TILL ALL THE GROUP HAD BEGGED
FOR INVITATIONS BUT TOM AND AMY
THEN TOM TURNED COOLLY AWAY STILL
TALKING AND TOOK AMY WITH HIM
BECKY'S LIPS TREMBLED AND THE TEARS
CAME TO HER EYES SHE HID THESE SIGNS WITH A FORCED GAYETY AND WENT ON
CHATTERING BUT THE LIFE HAD GONE OUT OF THE PICNIC NOW AND OUT OF
EVERYTHING ELSE SHE GOT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE COULD AND HID HERSELF AND
HAD WHAT HER SEX CALL A GOOD CRY THEN SHE SAT MOODY WITH WOUNDED
PRIDE TILL THE BELL RANG
SHE ROUSED UP NOW WITH A VINDICTIVE CAST
IN HER EYE AND GAVE HER PLAITED TAILS A SHAKE AND SAID SHE KNEW WHAT
SHE'D DO
AT RECESS TOM CONTINUED HIS FLIRTATION WITH AMY WITH JUBILANT
SELF SATISFACTION
AND HE KEPT DRIFTING ABOUT TO FIND BECKY AND LACERATE
HER WITH THE PERFORMANCE
AT LAST HE SPIED HER BUT THERE WAS A SUDDEN
FALLING OF HIS MERCURY
SHE WAS SITTING COSILY ON A LITTLE BENCH BEHIND
THE SCHOOLHOUSE LOOKING AT A PICTURE BOOK WITH ALFRED TEMPLE AND SO
ABSORBED WERE THEY AND THEIR HEADS SO CLOSE TOGETHER OVER THE BOOK
THAT THEY DID NOT SEEM TO BE CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BESIDES
JEALOUSY RAN RED HOT THROUGH TOM'S VEINS
HE BEGAN TO HATE HIMSELF FOR
THROWING AWAY THE CHANCE BECKY HAD OFFERED FOR A RECONCILIATION
HE
CALLED HIMSELF A FOOL AND ALL THE HARD NAMES HE COULD THINK OF
HE
WANTED TO CRY WITH VEXATION
AMY CHATTED HAPPILY ALONG AS THEY WALKED
FOR HER HEART WAS SINGING BUT TOM'S TONGUE HAD LOST ITS FUNCTION
HE
DID NOT HEAR WHAT AMY WAS SAYING AND WHENEVER SHE PAUSED EXPECTANTLY
HE COULD ONLY STAMMER AN AWKWARD ASSENT WHICH WAS AS OFTEN MISPLACED
AS OTHERWISE
HE KEPT DRIFTING TO THE REAR OF THE SCHOOLHOUSE AGAIN AND
AGAIN TO SEAR HIS EYEBALLS WITH THE HATEFUL SPECTACLE THERE
HE COULD
NOT HELP IT
AND IT MADDENED HIM TO SEE AS HE THOUGHT HE SAW THAT
BECKY THATCHER NEVER ONCE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS EVEN IN THE LAND OF THE
LIVING
BUT SHE DID SEE NEVERTHELESS AND SHE KNEW SHE WAS WINNING HER
FIGHT TOO AND WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM SUFFER AS SHE HAD SUFFERED
AMY'S HAPPY PRATTLE BECAME INTOLERABLE
TOM HINTED AT THINGS HE HAD
TO ATTEND TO THINGS THAT MUST BE DONE AND TIME WAS FLEETING
BUT IN
VAIN THE GIRL CHIRPED ON
TOM THOUGHT OH HANG HER AIN'T I EVER GOING
TO GET RID OF HER AT LAST HE MUST BE ATTENDING TO THOSE THINGS AND SHE
SAID ARTLESSLY THAT SHE WOULD BE AROUND WHEN SCHOOL LET OUT
AND HE
HASTENED AWAY HATING HER FOR IT
ANY OTHER BOY TOM THOUGHT GRATING HIS TEETH
ANY BOY IN THE WHOLE
TOWN BUT THAT SAINT LOUIS SMARTY THAT THINKS HE DRESSES SO FINE AND IS
ARISTOCRACY OH ALL RIGHT I LICKED YOU THE FIRST DAY YOU EVER SAW THIS
TOWN MISTER AND I'LL LICK YOU AGAIN YOU JUST WAIT TILL I CATCH YOU
OUT I'LL JUST TAKE AND
AND HE WENT THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF THRASHING AN IMAGINARY BOY PUMMELLING
THE AIR AND KICKING AND GOUGING
OH YOU DO DO YOU YOU HOLLER
'NOUGH DO YOU NOW THEN LET THAT LEARN YOU AND SO THE IMAGINARY
FLOGGING WAS FINISHED TO HIS SATISFACTION
TOM FLED HOME AT NOON
HIS CONSCIENCE COULD NOT ENDURE ANY MORE OF AMY'S
GRATEFUL HAPPINESS AND HIS JEALOUSY COULD BEAR NO MORE OF THE OTHER
DISTRESS
BECKY RESUMED HER PICTURE INSPECTIONS WITH ALFRED BUT AS THE
MINUTES DRAGGED ALONG AND NO TOM CAME TO SUFFER HER TRIUMPH BEGAN TO
CLOUD AND SHE LOST INTEREST GRAVITY AND ABSENTMINDEDNESS FOLLOWED
AND THEN MELANCHOLY TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE PRICKED UP HER EAR AT
A FOOTSTEP BUT IT WAS A FALSE HOPE NO TOM CAME
AT LAST SHE GREW
ENTIRELY MISERABLE AND WISHED SHE HADN'T CARRIED IT SO FAR
WHEN
POOR ALFRED SEEING THAT HE WAS LOSING HER HE DID NOT KNOW HOW KEPT
EXCLAIMING OH HERE'S A JOLLY ONE LOOK AT THIS SHE LOST PATIENCE AT
LAST AND SAID OH DON'T BOTHER ME I DON'T CARE FOR THEM AND BURST
INTO TEARS AND GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY
ALFRED DROPPED ALONGSIDE AND WAS GOING TO TRY TO COMFORT HER BUT SHE
SAID
GO AWAY AND LEAVE ME ALONE CAN'T YOU I HATE YOU
SO THE BOY HALTED WONDERING WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE FOR SHE HAD SAID
SHE WOULD LOOK AT PICTURES ALL THROUGH THE NOONING AND SHE WALKED ON
CRYING
THEN ALFRED WENT MUSING INTO THE DESERTED SCHOOLHOUSE
HE WAS
HUMILIATED AND ANGRY
HE EASILY GUESSED HIS WAY TO THE TRUTH THE GIRL
HAD SIMPLY MADE A CONVENIENCE OF HIM TO VENT HER SPITE UPON TOM SAWYER
HE WAS FAR FROM HATING TOM THE LESS WHEN THIS THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM
HE WISHED THERE WAS SOME WAY TO GET THAT BOY INTO TROUBLE WITHOUT MUCH
RISK TO HIMSELF
TOM'S SPELLING BOOK FELL UNDER HIS EYE
HERE WAS HIS
OPPORTUNITY
HE GRATEFULLY OPENED TO THE LESSON FOR THE AFTERNOON AND
POURED INK UPON THE PAGE
BECKY GLANCING IN AT A WINDOW BEHIND HIM AT THE MOMENT SAW THE ACT
AND MOVED ON WITHOUT DISCOVERING HERSELF
SHE STARTED HOMEWARD NOW
INTENDING TO FIND TOM AND TELL HIM TOM WOULD BE THANKFUL AND THEIR
TROUBLES WOULD BE HEALED
BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY HOME HOWEVER SHE
HAD CHANGED HER MIND
THE THOUGHT OF TOM'S TREATMENT OF HER WHEN SHE WAS
TALKING ABOUT HER PICNIC CAME SCORCHING BACK AND FILLED HER WITH SHAME
SHE RESOLVED TO LET HIM GET WHIPPED ON THE DAMAGED SPELLING BOOK'S
ACCOUNT AND TO HATE HIM FOREVER INTO THE BARGAIN
CHAPTER XIX
TOM ARRIVED AT HOME IN A DREARY MOOD AND THE FIRST THING HIS AUNT SAID
TO HIM SHOWED HIM THAT HE HAD BROUGHT HIS SORROWS TO AN UNPROMISING
MARKET
TOM I'VE A NOTION TO SKIN YOU ALIVE
AUNTIE WHAT HAVE I DONE
WELL YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH
HERE I GO OVER TO SERENY HARPER LIKE AN OLD
SOFTY EXPECTING I'M GOING TO MAKE HER BELIEVE ALL THAT RUBBAGE ABOUT
THAT DREAM WHEN LO AND BEHOLD YOU SHE'D FOUND OUT FROM JOE THAT YOU WAS
OVER HERE AND HEARD ALL THE TALK WE HAD THAT NIGHT
TOM I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF A BOY THAT WILL ACT LIKE THAT
IT MAKES ME FEEL SO
BAD TO THINK YOU COULD LET ME GO TO SERENY HARPER AND MAKE SUCH A FOOL
OF MYSELF AND NEVER SAY A WORD
THIS WAS A NEW ASPECT OF THE THING
HIS SMARTNESS OF THE MORNING HAD
SEEMED TO TOM A GOOD JOKE BEFORE AND VERY INGENIOUS
IT MERELY LOOKED
MEAN AND SHABBY NOW
HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO
SAY FOR A MOMENT
THEN HE SAID
AUNTIE I WISH I HADN'T DONE IT BUT I DIDN'T THINK
OH CHILD YOU NEVER THINK
YOU NEVER THINK OF ANYTHING BUT YOUR
OWN SELFISHNESS
YOU COULD THINK TO COME ALL THE WAY OVER HERE FROM
JACKSON'S ISLAND IN THE NIGHT TO LAUGH AT OUR TROUBLES AND YOU COULD
THINK TO FOOL ME WITH A LIE ABOUT A DREAM BUT YOU COULDN'T EVER THINK
TO PITY US AND SAVE US FROM SORROW
AUNTIE I KNOW NOW IT WAS MEAN BUT I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE MEAN
I DIDN'T
HONEST
AND BESIDES I DIDN'T COME OVER HERE TO LAUGH AT YOU THAT
NIGHT
WHAT DID YOU COME FOR THEN
IT WAS TO TELL YOU NOT TO BE UNEASY ABOUT US BECAUSE WE HADN'T GOT
DROWNDED
TOM TOM I WOULD BE THE THANKFULLEST SOUL IN THIS WORLD IF I COULD
BELIEVE YOU EVER HAD AS GOOD A THOUGHT AS THAT BUT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER
DID AND I KNOW IT TOM
INDEED AND 'DEED I DID AUNTIE I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DIDN'T
OH TOM DON'T LIE DON'T DO IT
IT ONLY MAKES THINGS A HUNDRED TIMES
WORSE
IT AIN'T A LIE AUNTIE IT'S THE TRUTH
I WANTED TO KEEP YOU FROM
GRIEVING THAT WAS ALL THAT MADE ME COME
I'D GIVE THE WHOLE WORLD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD COVER UP A POWER
OF SINS TOM
I'D 'MOST BE GLAD YOU'D RUN OFF AND ACTED SO BAD
BUT IT
AIN'T REASONABLE BECAUSE WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME CHILD
WHY YOU SEE WHEN YOU GOT TO TALKING ABOUT THE FUNERAL I JUST GOT ALL
FULL OF THE IDEA OF OUR COMING AND HIDING IN THE CHURCH AND I COULDN'T
SOMEHOW BEAR TO SPOIL IT
SO I JUST PUT THE BARK BACK IN MY POCKET AND
KEPT MUM
WHAT BARK
THE BARK I HAD WROTE ON TO TELL YOU WE'D GONE PIRATING
I WISH NOW
YOU'D WAKED UP WHEN I KISSED YOU I DO HONEST
THE HARD LINES IN HIS AUNT'S FACE RELAXED AND A SUDDEN TENDERNESS DAWNED
IN HER EYES
DID YOU KISS ME TOM
WHY YES I DID
ARE YOU SURE YOU DID TOM
WHY YES I DID AUNTIE CERTAIN SURE
WHAT DID YOU KISS ME FOR TOM
BECAUSE I LOVED YOU SO AND YOU LAID THERE MOANING AND I WAS SO SORRY
THE WORDS SOUNDED LIKE TRUTH
THE OLD LADY COULD NOT HIDE A TREMOR IN
HER VOICE WHEN SHE SAID
KISS ME AGAIN TOM AND BE OFF WITH YOU TO SCHOOL NOW AND DON'T
BOTHER ME ANY MORE
THE MOMENT HE WAS GONE SHE RAN TO A CLOSET AND GOT OUT THE RUIN OF A
JACKET WHICH TOM HAD GONE PIRATING IN
THEN SHE STOPPED WITH IT IN HER
HAND AND SAID TO HERSELF
NO I DON'T DARE
POOR BOY I RECKON HE'S LIED ABOUT IT BUT IT'S A
BLESSED BLESSED LIE THERE'S SUCH A COMFORT COME FROM IT
I HOPE
THE LORD I KNOW THE LORD WILL FORGIVE HIM BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH
GOOD HEARTEDNESS IN HIM TO TELL IT
BUT I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT IT'S A
LIE
I WON'T LOOK
SHE PUT THE JACKET AWAY AND STOOD BY MUSING A MINUTE
TWICE SHE PUT OUT
HER HAND TO TAKE THE GARMENT AGAIN AND TWICE SHE REFRAINED
ONCE MORE
SHE VENTURED AND THIS TIME SHE FORTIFIED HERSELF WITH THE THOUGHT
IT'S A GOOD LIE IT'S A GOOD LIE I WON'T LET IT GRIEVE ME SO SHE
SOUGHT THE JACKET POCKET
A MOMENT LATER SHE WAS READING TOM'S PIECE OF
BARK THROUGH FLOWING TEARS AND SAYING I COULD FORGIVE THE BOY NOW IF
HE'D COMMITTED A MILLION SINS
CHAPTER XX
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT AUNT POLLY'S MANNER WHEN SHE KISSED TOM THAT
SWEPT AWAY HIS LOW SPIRITS AND MADE HIM LIGHTHEARTED AND HAPPY AGAIN
HE
STARTED TO SCHOOL AND HAD THE LUCK OF COMING UPON BECKY THATCHER AT THE
HEAD OF MEADOW LANE
HIS MOOD ALWAYS DETERMINED HIS MANNER
WITHOUT A
MOMENT'S HESITATION HE RAN TO HER AND SAID
I ACTED MIGHTY MEAN TODAY BECKY AND I'M SO SORRY
I WON'T EVER EVER
DO THAT WAY AGAIN AS LONG AS EVER I LIVE PLEASE MAKE UP WON'T YOU
THE GIRL STOPPED AND LOOKED HIM SCORNFULLY IN THE FACE
I'LL THANK YOU TO KEEP YOURSELF TO YOURSELF MR
THOMAS SAWYER
I'LL
NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN
SHE TOSSED HER HEAD AND PASSED ON
TOM WAS SO STUNNED THAT HE HAD NOT
EVEN PRESENCE OF MIND ENOUGH TO SAY WHO CARES MISS SMARTY UNTIL THE
RIGHT TIME TO SAY IT HAD GONE BY
SO HE SAID NOTHING
BUT HE WAS IN A
FINE RAGE NEVERTHELESS
HE MOPED INTO THE SCHOOLYARD WISHING SHE WERE
A BOY AND IMAGINING HOW HE WOULD TROUNCE HER IF SHE WERE
HE PRESENTLY
ENCOUNTERED HER AND DELIVERED A STINGING REMARK AS HE PASSED
SHE HURLED
ONE IN RETURN AND THE ANGRY BREACH WAS COMPLETE
IT SEEMED TO BECKY IN
HER HOT RESENTMENT THAT SHE COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR SCHOOL TO TAKE IN
SHE WAS SO IMPATIENT TO SEE TOM FLOGGED FOR THE INJURED SPELLING BOOK
IF SHE HAD HAD ANY LINGERING NOTION OF EXPOSING ALFRED TEMPLE TOM'S
OFFENSIVE FLING HAD DRIVEN IT ENTIRELY AWAY
POOR GIRL SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW FAST SHE WAS NEARING TROUBLE HERSELF
THE MASTER MR
DOBBINS HAD REACHED MIDDLE AGE WITH AN UNSATISFIED
AMBITION
THE DARLING OF HIS DESIRES WAS TO BE A DOCTOR BUT
POVERTY HAD DECREED THAT HE SHOULD BE NOTHING HIGHER THAN A VILLAGE
SCHOOLMASTER
EVERY DAY HE TOOK A MYSTERIOUS BOOK OUT OF HIS DESK AND
ABSORBED HIMSELF IN IT AT TIMES WHEN NO CLASSES WERE RECITING
HE KEPT
THAT BOOK UNDER LOCK AND KEY
THERE WAS NOT AN URCHIN IN SCHOOL BUT WAS
PERISHING TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF IT BUT THE CHANCE NEVER CAME
EVERY BOY
AND GIRL HAD A THEORY ABOUT THE NATURE OF THAT BOOK BUT NO TWO THEORIES
WERE ALIKE AND THERE WAS NO WAY OF GETTING AT THE FACTS IN THE CASE
NOW AS BECKY WAS PASSING BY THE DESK WHICH STOOD NEAR THE DOOR SHE
NOTICED THAT THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK IT WAS A PRECIOUS MOMENT
SHE
GLANCED AROUND FOUND HERSELF ALONE AND THE NEXT INSTANT SHE HAD THE
BOOK IN HER HANDS
THE TITLEPAGE PROFESSOR SOMEBODY'S ANATOMY CARRIED
NO INFORMATION TO HER MIND SO SHE BEGAN TO TURN THE LEAVES
SHE CAME AT
ONCE UPON A HANDSOMELY ENGRAVED AND COLORED FRONTISPIECE A HUMAN FIGURE
STARK NAKED
AT THAT MOMENT A SHADOW FELL ON THE PAGE AND TOM SAWYER
STEPPED IN AT THE DOOR AND CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE PICTURE
BECKY
SNATCHED AT THE BOOK TO CLOSE IT AND HAD THE HARD LUCK TO TEAR THE
PICTURED PAGE HALF DOWN THE MIDDLE
SHE THRUST THE VOLUME INTO THE DESK
TURNED THE KEY AND BURST OUT CRYING WITH SHAME AND VEXATION
TOM SAWYER YOU ARE JUST AS MEAN AS YOU CAN BE TO SNEAK UP ON A PERSON
AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT
HOW COULD I KNOW YOU WAS LOOKING AT ANYTHING
YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF TOM SAWYER YOU KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL ON ME AND OH WHAT SHALL I DO WHAT SHALL I DO I'LL BE
WHIPPED AND I NEVER WAS WHIPPED IN SCHOOL
THEN SHE STAMPED HER LITTLE FOOT AND SAID
BE SO MEAN IF YOU WANT TO I KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
YOU JUST WAIT AND YOU'LL SEE HATEFUL HATEFUL HATEFUL AND SHE FLUNG
OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH A NEW EXPLOSION OF CRYING
TOM STOOD STILL RATHER FLUSTERED BY THIS ONSLAUGHT
PRESENTLY HE SAID
TO HIMSELF
WHAT A CURIOUS KIND OF A FOOL A GIRL IS NEVER BEEN LICKED IN
SCHOOL SHUCKS WHAT'S A LICKING THAT'S JUST LIKE A GIRL THEY'RE SO
THIN SKINNED AND CHICKEN HEARTED
WELL OF COURSE I AIN'T GOING TO TELL
OLD DOBBINS ON THIS LITTLE FOOL BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER WAYS OF GETTING
EVEN ON HER THAT AIN'T SO MEAN BUT WHAT OF IT OLD DOBBINS WILL ASK
WHO IT WAS TORE HIS BOOK
NOBODY'LL ANSWER
THEN HE'LL DO JUST THE WAY
HE ALWAYS DOES ASK FIRST ONE AND THEN T'OTHER AND WHEN HE COMES TO THE
RIGHT GIRL HE'LL KNOW IT WITHOUT ANY TELLING
GIRLS' FACES ALWAYS TELL
ON THEM
THEY AIN'T GOT ANY BACKBONE
SHE'LL GET LICKED
WELL IT'S A
KIND OF A TIGHT PLACE FOR BECKY THATCHER BECAUSE THERE AIN'T ANY WAY
OUT OF IT TOM CONNED THE THING A MOMENT LONGER AND THEN ADDED ALL
RIGHT THOUGH SHE'D LIKE TO SEE ME IN JUST SUCH A FIX LET HER SWEAT IT
OUT
TOM JOINED THE MOB OF SKYLARKING SCHOLARS OUTSIDE
IN A FEW MOMENTS THE
MASTER ARRIVED AND SCHOOL TOOK IN TOM DID NOT FEEL A STRONG INTEREST
IN HIS STUDIES
EVERY TIME HE STOLE A GLANCE AT THE GIRLS' SIDE OF THE
ROOM BECKY'S FACE TROUBLED HIM
CONSIDERING ALL THINGS HE DID NOT WANT
TO PITY HER AND YET IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO HELP IT
HE COULD GET
UP NO EXULTATION THAT WAS REALLY WORTHY THE NAME
PRESENTLY THE
SPELLING BOOK DISCOVERY WAS MADE AND TOM'S MIND WAS ENTIRELY FULL
OF HIS OWN MATTERS FOR A WHILE AFTER THAT
BECKY ROUSED UP FROM HER
LETHARGY OF DISTRESS AND SHOWED GOOD INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS
SHE
DID NOT EXPECT THAT TOM COULD GET OUT OF HIS TROUBLE BY DENYING THAT HE
SPILT THE INK ON THE BOOK HIMSELF AND SHE WAS RIGHT
THE DENIAL ONLY
SEEMED TO MAKE THE THING WORSE FOR TOM
BECKY SUPPOSED SHE WOULD BE GLAD
OF THAT AND SHE TRIED TO BELIEVE SHE WAS GLAD OF IT BUT SHE FOUND SHE
WAS NOT CERTAIN
WHEN THE WORST CAME TO THE WORST SHE HAD AN IMPULSE
TO GET UP AND TELL ON ALFRED TEMPLE BUT SHE MADE AN EFFORT AND FORCED
HERSELF TO KEEP STILL BECAUSE SAID SHE TO HERSELF HE'LL TELL ABOUT ME
TEARING THE PICTURE SURE
I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD NOT TO SAVE HIS LIFE
TOM TOOK HIS WHIPPING AND WENT BACK TO HIS SEAT NOT AT ALL
BROKEN HEARTED FOR HE THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE HAD UNKNOWINGLY
UPSET THE INK ON THE SPELLING BOOK HIMSELF IN SOME SKYLARKING BOUT HE
HAD DENIED IT FOR FORM'S SAKE AND BECAUSE IT WAS CUSTOM AND HAD STUCK
TO THE DENIAL FROM PRINCIPLE
A WHOLE HOUR DRIFTED BY THE MASTER SAT NODDING IN HIS THRONE THE AIR
WAS DROWSY WITH THE HUM OF STUDY
BY AND BY MR
DOBBINS STRAIGHTENED
HIMSELF UP YAWNED THEN UNLOCKED HIS DESK AND REACHED FOR HIS BOOK
BUT SEEMED UNDECIDED WHETHER TO TAKE IT OUT OR LEAVE IT
MOST OF THE
PUPILS GLANCED UP LANGUIDLY BUT THERE WERE TWO AMONG THEM THAT WATCHED
HIS MOVEMENTS WITH INTENT EYES
MR
DOBBINS FINGERED HIS BOOK ABSENTLY
FOR A WHILE THEN TOOK IT OUT AND SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS CHAIR TO READ
TOM SHOT A GLANCE AT BECKY
HE HAD SEEN A HUNTED AND HELPLESS RABBIT
LOOK AS SHE DID WITH A GUN LEVELLED AT ITS HEAD
INSTANTLY HE FORGOT
HIS QUARREL WITH HER
QUICK SOMETHING MUST BE DONE DONE IN A FLASH
TOO BUT THE VERY IMMINENCE OF THE EMERGENCY PARALYZED HIS INVENTION
GOOD HE HAD AN INSPIRATION HE WOULD RUN AND SNATCH THE BOOK SPRING
THROUGH THE DOOR AND FLY
BUT HIS RESOLUTION SHOOK FOR ONE LITTLE
INSTANT AND THE CHANCE WAS LOST THE MASTER OPENED THE VOLUME
IF TOM
ONLY HAD THE WASTED OPPORTUNITY BACK AGAIN TOO LATE
THERE WAS NO HELP
FOR BECKY NOW HE SAID
THE NEXT MOMENT THE MASTER FACED THE SCHOOL
EVERY EYE SANK UNDER HIS GAZE
THERE WAS THAT IN IT WHICH SMOTE EVEN
THE INNOCENT WITH FEAR
THERE WAS SILENCE WHILE ONE MIGHT COUNT TEN THE
MASTER WAS GATHERING HIS WRATH
THEN HE SPOKE WHO TORE THIS BOOK
THERE WAS NOT A SOUND
ONE COULD HAVE HEARD A PIN DROP
THE STILLNESS
CONTINUED THE MASTER SEARCHED FACE AFTER FACE FOR SIGNS OF GUILT
BENJAMIN ROGERS DID YOU TEAR THIS BOOK
A DENIAL
ANOTHER PAUSE
JOSEPH HARPER DID YOU
ANOTHER DENIAL
TOM'S UNEASINESS GREW MORE AND MORE INTENSE UNDER THE
SLOW TORTURE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS
THE MASTER SCANNED THE RANKS OF
BOYS CONSIDERED A WHILE THEN TURNED TO THE GIRLS
AMY LAWRENCE
A SHAKE OF THE HEAD
GRACIE MILLER
THE SAME SIGN
SUSAN HARPER DID YOU DO THIS
ANOTHER NEGATIVE
THE NEXT GIRL WAS BECKY THATCHER
TOM WAS TREMBLING
FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH EXCITEMENT AND A SENSE OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF THE
SITUATION
REBECCA THATCHER TOM GLANCED AT HER FACE IT WAS WHITE WITH
TERROR DID YOU TEAR NO LOOK ME IN THE FACE HER HANDS ROSE IN
APPEAL DID YOU TEAR THIS BOOK
A THOUGHT SHOT LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH TOM'S BRAIN
HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET
AND SHOUTED I DONE IT
THE SCHOOL STARED IN PERPLEXITY AT THIS INCREDIBLE FOLLY
TOM STOOD A
MOMENT TO GATHER HIS DISMEMBERED FACULTIES AND WHEN HE STEPPED FORWARD
TO GO TO HIS PUNISHMENT THE SURPRISE THE GRATITUDE THE ADORATION THAT
SHONE UPON HIM OUT OF POOR BECKY'S EYES SEEMED PAY ENOUGH FOR A HUNDRED
FLOGGINGS
INSPIRED BY THE SPLENDOR OF HIS OWN ACT HE TOOK WITHOUT
AN OUTCRY THE MOST MERCILESS FLAYING THAT EVEN MR
DOBBINS HAD EVER
ADMINISTERED AND ALSO RECEIVED WITH INDIFFERENCE THE ADDED CRUELTY OF A
COMMAND TO REMAIN TWO HOURS AFTER SCHOOL SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR HE
KNEW WHO WOULD WAIT FOR HIM OUTSIDE TILL HIS CAPTIVITY WAS DONE AND NOT
COUNT THE TEDIOUS TIME AS LOSS EITHER
TOM WENT TO BED THAT NIGHT PLANNING VENGEANCE AGAINST ALFRED TEMPLE FOR
WITH SHAME AND REPENTANCE BECKY HAD TOLD HIM ALL NOT FORGETTING HER OWN
TREACHERY BUT EVEN THE LONGING FOR VENGEANCE HAD TO GIVE WAY SOON TO
PLEASANTER MUSINGS AND HE FELL ASLEEP AT LAST WITH BECKY'S LATEST WORDS
LINGERING DREAMILY IN HIS EAR
TOM HOW COULD YOU BE SO NOBLE
CHAPTER XXI
VACATION WAS APPROACHING
THE SCHOOLMASTER ALWAYS SEVERE GREW SEVERER
AND MORE EXACTING THAN EVER FOR HE WANTED THE SCHOOL TO MAKE A GOOD
SHOWING ON EXAMINATION DAY
HIS ROD AND HIS FERULE WERE SELDOM IDLE
NOW AT LEAST AMONG THE SMALLER PUPILS
ONLY THE BIGGEST BOYS AND YOUNG
LADIES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ESCAPED LASHING
MR
DOBBINS' LASHINGS
WERE VERY VIGOROUS ONES TOO FOR ALTHOUGH HE CARRIED UNDER HIS WIG A
PERFECTLY BALD AND SHINY HEAD HE HAD ONLY REACHED MIDDLE AGE AND THERE
WAS NO SIGN OF FEEBLENESS IN HIS MUSCLE
AS THE GREAT DAY APPROACHED
ALL THE TYRANNY THAT WAS IN HIM CAME TO THE SURFACE HE SEEMED TO TAKE A
VINDICTIVE PLEASURE IN PUNISHING THE LEAST SHORTCOMINGS
THE CONSEQUENCE
WAS THAT THE SMALLER BOYS SPENT THEIR DAYS IN TERROR AND SUFFERING AND
THEIR NIGHTS IN PLOTTING REVENGE
THEY THREW AWAY NO OPPORTUNITY TO DO
THE MASTER A MISCHIEF
BUT HE KEPT AHEAD ALL THE TIME
THE RETRIBUTION
THAT FOLLOWED EVERY VENGEFUL SUCCESS WAS SO SWEEPING AND MAJESTIC THAT
THE BOYS ALWAYS RETIRED FROM THE FIELD BADLY WORSTED
AT LAST THEY
CONSPIRED TOGETHER AND HIT UPON A PLAN THAT PROMISED A DAZZLING VICTORY
THEY SWORE IN THE SIGNPAINTER'S BOY TOLD HIM THE SCHEME AND ASKED HIS
HELP
HE HAD HIS OWN REASONS FOR BEING DELIGHTED FOR THE MASTER BOARDED
IN HIS FATHER'S FAMILY AND HAD GIVEN THE BOY AMPLE CAUSE TO HATE HIM
THE MASTER'S WIFE WOULD GO ON A VISIT TO THE COUNTRY IN A FEW DAYS AND
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO INTERFERE WITH THE PLAN THE MASTER ALWAYS
PREPARED HIMSELF FOR GREAT OCCASIONS BY GETTING PRETTY WELL FUDDLED AND
THE SIGNPAINTER'S BOY SAID THAT WHEN THE DOMINIE HAD REACHED THE PROPER
CONDITION ON EXAMINATION EVENING HE WOULD MANAGE THE THING WHILE HE
NAPPED IN HIS CHAIR THEN HE WOULD HAVE HIM AWAKENED AT THE RIGHT TIME
AND HURRIED AWAY TO SCHOOL
IN THE FULNESS OF TIME THE INTERESTING OCCASION ARRIVED
AT EIGHT IN
THE EVENING THE SCHOOLHOUSE WAS BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED AND ADORNED WITH
WREATHS AND FESTOONS OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
THE MASTER SAT THRONED IN
HIS GREAT CHAIR UPON A RAISED PLATFORM WITH HIS BLACKBOARD BEHIND HIM
HE WAS LOOKING TOLERABLY MELLOW
THREE ROWS OF BENCHES ON EACH SIDE AND
SIX ROWS IN FRONT OF HIM WERE OCCUPIED BY THE DIGNITARIES OF THE TOWN
AND BY THE PARENTS OF THE PUPILS
TO HIS LEFT BACK OF THE ROWS OF
CITIZENS WAS A SPACIOUS TEMPORARY PLATFORM UPON WHICH WERE SEATED THE
SCHOLARS WHO WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE EXERCISES OF THE EVENING ROWS OF
SMALL BOYS WASHED AND DRESSED TO AN INTOLERABLE STATE OF DISCOMFORT
ROWS OF GAWKY BIG BOYS SNOWBANKS OF GIRLS AND YOUNG LADIES CLAD IN
LAWN AND MUSLIN AND CONSPICUOUSLY CONSCIOUS OF THEIR BARE ARMS THEIR
GRANDMOTHERS' ANCIENT TRINKETS THEIR BITS OF PINK AND BLUE RIBBON AND
THE FLOWERS IN THEIR HAIR
ALL THE REST OF THE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH
NON PARTICIPATING SCHOLARS
THE EXERCISES BEGAN
A VERY LITTLE BOY STOOD UP AND SHEEPISHLY RECITED
YOU'D SCARCE EXPECT ONE OF MY AGE TO SPEAK IN PUBLIC ON THE STAGE
ETC ACCOMPANYING HIMSELF WITH THE PAINFULLY EXACT AND SPASMODIC
GESTURES WHICH A MACHINE MIGHT HAVE USED SUPPOSING THE MACHINE TO BE A
TRIFLE OUT OF ORDER
BUT HE GOT THROUGH SAFELY THOUGH CRUELLY SCARED
AND GOT A FINE ROUND OF APPLAUSE WHEN HE MADE HIS MANUFACTURED BOW AND
RETIRED
A LITTLE SHAMEFACED GIRL LISPED MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB ETC
PERFORMED A COMPASSION INSPIRING CURTSY GOT HER MEED OF APPLAUSE AND
SAT DOWN FLUSHED AND HAPPY
TOM SAWYER STEPPED FORWARD WITH CONCEITED CONFIDENCE AND SOARED INTO
THE UNQUENCHABLE AND INDESTRUCTIBLE GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH
SPEECH WITH FINE FURY AND FRANTIC GESTICULATION AND BROKE DOWN IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT
A GHASTLY STAGE FRIGHT SEIZED HIM HIS LEGS QUAKED UNDER
HIM AND HE WAS LIKE TO CHOKE
TRUE HE HAD THE MANIFEST SYMPATHY OF THE
HOUSE BUT HE HAD THE HOUSE'S SILENCE TOO WHICH WAS EVEN WORSE THAN
ITS SYMPATHY
THE MASTER FROWNED AND THIS COMPLETED THE DISASTER
TOM
STRUGGLED AWHILE AND THEN RETIRED UTTERLY DEFEATED
THERE WAS A WEAK
ATTEMPT AT APPLAUSE BUT IT DIED EARLY
THE BOY STOOD ON THE BURNING DECK FOLLOWED ALSO THE ASSYRIAN CAME
DOWN AND OTHER DECLAMATORY GEMS
THEN THERE WERE READING EXERCISES
AND A SPELLING FIGHT
THE MEAGRE LATIN CLASS RECITED WITH HONOR
THE
PRIME FEATURE OF THE EVENING WAS IN ORDER NOW ORIGINAL COMPOSITIONS
BY THE YOUNG LADIES
EACH IN HER TURN STEPPED FORWARD TO THE EDGE OF THE
PLATFORM CLEARED HER THROAT HELD UP HER MANUSCRIPT TIED WITH DAINTY
RIBBON AND PROCEEDED TO READ WITH LABORED ATTENTION TO EXPRESSION
AND PUNCTUATION
THE THEMES WERE THE SAME THAT HAD BEEN ILLUMINATED UPON
SIMILAR OCCASIONS BY THEIR MOTHERS BEFORE THEM THEIR GRANDMOTHERS
AND DOUBTLESS ALL THEIR ANCESTORS IN THE FEMALE LINE CLEAR BACK TO THE
CRUSADES
FRIENDSHIP WAS ONE MEMORIES OF OTHER DAYS RELIGION IN
HISTORY DREAM LAND THE ADVANTAGES OF CULTURE FORMS OF POLITICAL
GOVERNMENT COMPARED AND CONTRASTED MELANCHOLY FILIAL LOVE HEART
LONGINGS ETC ETC
A PREVALENT FEATURE IN THESE COMPOSITIONS WAS A NURSED AND PETTED
MELANCHOLY ANOTHER WAS A WASTEFUL AND OPULENT GUSH OF FINE LANGUAGE
ANOTHER WAS A TENDENCY TO LUG IN BY THE EARS PARTICULARLY PRIZED WORDS
AND PHRASES UNTIL THEY WERE WORN ENTIRELY OUT AND A PECULIARITY THAT
CONSPICUOUSLY MARKED AND MARRED THEM WAS THE INVETERATE AND INTOLERABLE
SERMON THAT WAGGED ITS CRIPPLED TAIL AT THE END OF EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF THEM
NO MATTER WHAT THE SUBJECT MIGHT BE A BRAINRACKING EFFORT WAS
MADE TO SQUIRM IT INTO SOME ASPECT OR OTHER THAT THE MORAL AND RELIGIOUS
MIND COULD CONTEMPLATE WITH EDIFICATION
THE GLARING INSINCERITY OF
THESE SERMONS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO COMPASS THE BANISHMENT OF THE
FASHION FROM THE SCHOOLS AND IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TODAY IT NEVER WILL
BE SUFFICIENT WHILE THE WORLD STANDS PERHAPS
THERE IS NO SCHOOL IN
ALL OUR LAND WHERE THE YOUNG LADIES DO NOT FEEL OBLIGED TO CLOSE THEIR
COMPOSITIONS WITH A SERMON AND YOU WILL FIND THAT THE SERMON OF THE
MOST FRIVOLOUS AND THE LEAST RELIGIOUS GIRL IN THE SCHOOL IS ALWAYS
THE LONGEST AND THE MOST RELENTLESSLY PIOUS
BUT ENOUGH OF THIS
HOMELY
TRUTH IS UNPALATABLE
LET US RETURN TO THE EXAMINATION THE FIRST COMPOSITION THAT WAS READ
WAS ONE ENTITLED IS THIS THEN LIFE PERHAPS THE READER CAN ENDURE AN
EXTRACT FROM IT
IN THE COMMON WALKS OF LIFE WITH WHAT DELIGHTFUL EMOTIONS DOES THE
YOUTHFUL MIND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME ANTICIPATED SCENE OF FESTIVITY
IMAGINATION IS BUSY SKETCHING ROSE TINTED PICTURES OF JOY
IN FANCY THE
VOLUPTUOUS VOTARY OF FASHION SEES HERSELF AMID THE FESTIVE THRONG 'THE
OBSERVED OF ALL OBSERVERS HER GRACEFUL FORM ARRAYED IN SNOWY ROBES
IS WHIRLING THROUGH THE MAZES OF THE JOYOUS DANCE HER EYE IS BRIGHTEST
HER STEP IS LIGHTEST IN THE GAY ASSEMBLY
IN SUCH DELICIOUS FANCIES TIME QUICKLY GLIDES BY AND THE WELCOME HOUR
ARRIVES FOR HER ENTRANCE INTO THE ELYSIAN WORLD OF WHICH SHE HAS
HAD SUCH BRIGHT DREAMS
HOW FAIRY LIKE DOES EVERYTHING APPEAR TO HER
ENCHANTED VISION EACH NEW SCENE IS MORE CHARMING THAN THE LAST
BUT
AFTER A WHILE SHE FINDS THAT BENEATH THIS GOODLY EXTERIOR ALL IS
VANITY THE FLATTERY WHICH ONCE CHARMED HER SOUL NOW GRATES HARSHLY
UPON HER EAR THE BALLROOM HAS LOST ITS CHARMS AND WITH WASTED HEALTH
AND IMBITTERED HEART SHE TURNS AWAY WITH THE CONVICTION THAT EARTHLY
PLEASURES CANNOT SATISFY THE LONGINGS OF THE SOUL
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON
THERE WAS A BUZZ OF GRATIFICATION FROM TIME TO
TIME DURING THE READING ACCOMPANIED BY WHISPERED EJACULATIONS OF HOW
SWEET HOW ELOQUENT SO TRUE ETC AND AFTER THE THING HAD CLOSED
WITH A PECULIARLY AFFLICTING SERMON THE APPLAUSE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC
THEN AROSE A SLIM MELANCHOLY GIRL WHOSE FACE HAD THE INTERESTING
PALENESS THAT COMES OF PILLS AND INDIGESTION AND READ A POEM TWO
STANZAS OF IT WILL DO
A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA
ALABAMA GOODBYE I LOVE THEE WELL BUT YET FOR A WHILE DO I LEAVE THEE
NOW SAD YES SAD THOUGHTS OF THEE MY HEART DOTH SWELL AND BURNING
RECOLLECTIONS THRONG MY BROW FOR I HAVE WANDERED THROUGH THY FLOWERY
WOODS HAVE ROAMED AND READ NEAR TALLAPOOSA'S STREAM HAVE LISTENED TO
TALLASSEE'S WARRING FLOODS AND WOOED ON COOSA'S SIDE AURORA'S BEAM
YET SHAME I NOT TO BEAR AN O'ERFULL HEART NOR BLUSH TO TURN BEHIND
MY TEARFUL EYES 'TIS FROM NO STRANGER LAND I NOW MUST PART 'TIS TO NO
STRANGERS LEFT I YIELD THESE SIGHS
WELCOME AND HOME WERE MINE WITHIN
THIS STATE WHOSE VALES I LEAVE WHOSE SPIRES FADE FAST FROM ME AND COLD
MUST BE MINE EYES AND HEART AND TETE WHEN DEAR ALABAMA THEY TURN
COLD ON THEE THERE WERE VERY FEW THERE WHO KNEW WHAT TETE MEANT BUT
THE POEM WAS VERY SATISFACTORY NEVERTHELESS
NEXT APPEARED A DARK COMPLEXIONED BLACK EYED BLACK HAIRED YOUNG LADY
WHO PAUSED AN IMPRESSIVE MOMENT ASSUMED A TRAGIC EXPRESSION AND BEGAN
TO READ IN A MEASURED SOLEMN TONE
A VISION
DARK AND TEMPESTUOUS WAS NIGHT
AROUND THE THRONE ON HIGH NOT A SINGLE
STAR QUIVERED BUT THE DEEP INTONATIONS OF THE HEAVY THUNDER CONSTANTLY
VIBRATED UPON THE EAR WHILST THE TERRIFIC LIGHTNING REVELLED IN ANGRY
MOOD THROUGH THE CLOUDY CHAMBERS OF HEAVEN SEEMING TO SCORN THE POWER
EXERTED OVER ITS TERROR BY THE ILLUSTRIOUS FRANKLIN EVEN THE BOISTEROUS
WINDS UNANIMOUSLY CAME FORTH FROM THEIR MYSTIC HOMES AND BLUSTERED
ABOUT AS IF TO ENHANCE BY THEIR AID THE WILDNESS OF THE SCENE
AT SUCH A TIME SO DARK SO DREARY FOR HUMAN SYMPATHY MY VERY SPIRIT
SIGHED BUT INSTEAD THEREOF
'MY DEAREST FRIEND MY COUNSELLOR MY COMFORTER AND GUIDE MY JOY IN
GRIEF MY SECOND BLISS IN JOY CAME TO MY SIDE
SHE MOVED LIKE ONE OF
THOSE BRIGHT BEINGS PICTURED IN THE SUNNY WALKS OF FANCY'S EDEN BY
THE ROMANTIC AND YOUNG A QUEEN OF BEAUTY UNADORNED SAVE BY HER OWN
TRANSCENDENT LOVELINESS
SO SOFT WAS HER STEP IT FAILED TO MAKE EVEN A
SOUND AND BUT FOR THE MAGICAL THRILL IMPARTED BY HER GENIAL TOUCH
AS OTHER UNOBTRUSIVE BEAUTIES SHE WOULD HAVE GLIDED AWAY
UNPERCEIVED UNSOUGHT
A STRANGE SADNESS RESTED UPON HER FEATURES LIKE
ICY TEARS UPON THE ROBE OF DECEMBER AS SHE POINTED TO THE CONTENDING
ELEMENTS WITHOUT AND BADE ME CONTEMPLATE THE TWO BEINGS PRESENTED
THIS NIGHTMARE OCCUPIED SOME TEN PAGES OF MANUSCRIPT AND WOUND UP WITH A
SERMON SO DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL HOPE TO NON PRESBYTERIANS THAT IT TOOK
THE FIRST PRIZE
THIS COMPOSITION WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE VERY FINEST
EFFORT OF THE EVENING
THE MAYOR OF THE VILLAGE IN DELIVERING THE PRIZE
TO THE AUTHOR OF IT MADE A WARM SPEECH IN WHICH HE SAID THAT IT WAS BY
FAR THE MOST ELOQUENT THING HE HAD EVER LISTENED TO AND THAT DANIEL
WEBSTER HIMSELF MIGHT WELL BE PROUD OF IT
IT MAY BE REMARKED IN PASSING THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPOSITIONS IN WHICH
THE WORD BEAUTEOUS WAS OVER FONDLED AND HUMAN EXPERIENCE REFERRED TO
AS LIFE'S PAGE WAS UP TO THE USUAL AVERAGE
NOW THE MASTER MELLOW ALMOST TO THE VERGE OF GENIALITY PUT HIS CHAIR
ASIDE TURNED HIS BACK TO THE AUDIENCE AND BEGAN TO DRAW A MAP OF
AMERICA ON THE BLACKBOARD TO EXERCISE THE GEOGRAPHY CLASS UPON
BUT HE
MADE A SAD BUSINESS OF IT WITH HIS UNSTEADY HAND AND A SMOTHERED TITTER
RIPPLED OVER THE HOUSE
HE KNEW WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND SET HIMSELF TO
RIGHT IT
HE SPONGED OUT LINES AND REMADE THEM BUT HE ONLY DISTORTED
THEM MORE THAN EVER AND THE TITTERING WAS MORE PRONOUNCED
HE THREW HIS
ENTIRE ATTENTION UPON HIS WORK NOW AS IF DETERMINED NOT TO BE PUT DOWN
BY THE MIRTH
HE FELT THAT ALL EYES WERE FASTENED UPON HIM HE IMAGINED
HE WAS SUCCEEDING AND YET THE TITTERING CONTINUED IT EVEN MANIFESTLY
INCREASED
AND WELL IT MIGHT
THERE WAS A GARRET ABOVE PIERCED WITH
A SCUTTLE OVER HIS HEAD AND DOWN THROUGH THIS SCUTTLE CAME A CAT
SUSPENDED AROUND THE HAUNCHES BY A STRING SHE HAD A RAG TIED ABOUT
HER HEAD AND JAWS TO KEEP HER FROM MEWING AS SHE SLOWLY DESCENDED SHE
CURVED UPWARD AND CLAWED AT THE STRING SHE SWUNG DOWNWARD AND CLAWED
AT THE INTANGIBLE AIR
THE TITTERING ROSE HIGHER AND HIGHER THE CAT WAS
WITHIN SIX INCHES OF THE ABSORBED TEACHER'S HEAD DOWN DOWN A LITTLE
LOWER AND SHE GRABBED HIS WIG WITH HER DESPERATE CLAWS CLUNG TO IT
AND WAS SNATCHED UP INTO THE GARRET IN AN INSTANT WITH HER TROPHY STILL
IN HER POSSESSION AND HOW THE LIGHT DID BLAZE ABROAD FROM THE MASTER'S
BALD PATE FOR THE SIGNPAINTER'S BOY HAD GILDED IT
THAT BROKE UP THE MEETING
THE BOYS WERE AVENGED
VACATION HAD COME
NOTE THE PRETENDED COMPOSITIONS QUOTED IN THIS CHAPTER ARE TAKEN
WITHOUT ALTERATION FROM A VOLUME ENTITLED PROSE AND POETRY BY A
WESTERN LADY BUT THEY ARE EXACTLY AND PRECISELY AFTER THE SCHOOLGIRL
PATTERN AND HENCE ARE MUCH HAPPIER THAN ANY MERE IMITATIONS COULD BE
CHAPTER XXII
TOM JOINED THE NEW ORDER OF CADETS OF TEMPERANCE BEING ATTRACTED BY THE
SHOWY CHARACTER OF THEIR REGALIA HE PROMISED TO ABSTAIN FROM SMOKING
CHEWING AND PROFANITY AS LONG AS HE REMAINED A MEMBER
NOW HE FOUND OUT
A NEW THING NAMELY THAT TO PROMISE NOT TO DO A THING IS THE SUREST WAY
IN THE WORLD TO MAKE A BODY WANT TO GO AND DO THAT VERY THING
TOM SOON
FOUND HIMSELF TORMENTED WITH A DESIRE TO DRINK AND SWEAR THE DESIRE
GREW TO BE SO INTENSE THAT NOTHING BUT THE HOPE OF A CHANCE TO DISPLAY
HIMSELF IN HIS RED SASH KEPT HIM FROM WITHDRAWING FROM THE ORDER
FOURTH
OF JULY WAS COMING BUT HE SOON GAVE THAT UP GAVE IT UP BEFORE HE HAD
WORN HIS SHACKLES OVER FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND FIXED HIS HOPES UPON OLD
JUDGE FRAZER JUSTICE OF THE PEACE WHO WAS APPARENTLY ON HIS DEATHBED
AND WOULD HAVE A BIG PUBLIC FUNERAL SINCE HE WAS SO HIGH AN OFFICIAL
DURING THREE DAYS TOM WAS DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE JUDGE'S CONDITION
AND HUNGRY FOR NEWS OF IT
SOMETIMES HIS HOPES RAN HIGH SO HIGH THAT
HE WOULD VENTURE TO GET OUT HIS REGALIA AND PRACTISE BEFORE THE
LOOKING GLASS
BUT THE JUDGE HAD A MOST DISCOURAGING WAY OF FLUCTUATING
AT LAST HE WAS PRONOUNCED UPON THE MEND AND THEN CONVALESCENT
TOM WAS
DISGUSTED AND FELT A SENSE OF INJURY TOO
HE HANDED IN HIS RESIGNATION
AT ONCE AND THAT NIGHT THE JUDGE SUFFERED A RELAPSE AND DIED
TOM
RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD NEVER TRUST A MAN LIKE THAT AGAIN
THE FUNERAL WAS A FINE THING
THE CADETS PARADED IN A STYLE CALCULATED
TO KILL THE LATE MEMBER WITH ENVY
TOM WAS A FREE BOY AGAIN
HOWEVER THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT
HE COULD DRINK AND SWEAR NOW BUT
FOUND TO HIS SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO
THE SIMPLE FACT THAT HE
COULD TOOK THE DESIRE AWAY AND THE CHARM OF IT
TOM PRESENTLY WONDERED TO FIND THAT HIS COVETED VACATION WAS BEGINNING
TO HANG A LITTLE HEAVILY ON HIS HANDS
HE ATTEMPTED A DIARY BUT NOTHING HAPPENED DURING THREE DAYS AND SO HE
ABANDONED IT
THE FIRST OF ALL THE NEGRO MINSTREL SHOWS CAME TO TOWN AND MADE A
SENSATION
TOM AND JOE HARPER GOT UP A BAND OF PERFORMERS AND WERE HAPPY
FOR TWO DAYS
EVEN THE GLORIOUS FOURTH WAS IN SOME SENSE A FAILURE FOR IT RAINED
HARD THERE WAS NO PROCESSION IN CONSEQUENCE AND THE GREATEST MAN
IN THE WORLD AS TOM SUPPOSED MR
BENTON AN ACTUAL UNITED STATES
SENATOR PROVED AN OVERWHELMING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HE WAS NOT
TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH NOR EVEN ANYWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF IT
A CIRCUS CAME
THE BOYS PLAYED CIRCUS FOR THREE DAYS AFTERWARD IN TENTS
MADE OF RAG CARPETING ADMISSION THREE PINS FOR BOYS TWO FOR GIRLS AND
THEN CIRCUSING WAS ABANDONED
A PHRENOLOGIST AND A MESMERIZER CAME AND WENT AGAIN AND LEFT THE VILLAGE
DULLER AND DREARIER THAN EVER
THERE WERE SOME BOYS AND GIRLS' PARTIES BUT THEY WERE SO FEW AND SO
DELIGHTFUL THAT THEY ONLY MADE THE ACHING VOIDS BETWEEN ACHE THE HARDER
BECKY THATCHER WAS GONE TO HER CONSTANTINOPLE HOME TO STAY WITH HER
PARENTS DURING VACATION SO THERE WAS NO BRIGHT SIDE TO LIFE ANYWHERE
THE DREADFUL SECRET OF THE MURDER WAS A CHRONIC MISERY
IT WAS A VERY
CANCER FOR PERMANENCY AND PAIN
THEN CAME THE MEASLES
DURING TWO LONG WEEKS TOM LAY A PRISONER DEAD TO THE WORLD AND ITS
HAPPENINGS
HE WAS VERY ILL HE WAS INTERESTED IN NOTHING
WHEN HE GOT
UPON HIS FEET AT LAST AND MOVED FEEBLY DOWNTOWN A MELANCHOLY CHANGE HAD
COME OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERY CREATURE
THERE HAD BEEN A REVIVAL AND
EVERYBODY HAD GOT RELIGION NOT ONLY THE ADULTS BUT EVEN THE BOYS AND
GIRLS
TOM WENT ABOUT HOPING AGAINST HOPE FOR THE SIGHT OF ONE BLESSED
SINFUL FACE BUT DISAPPOINTMENT CROSSED HIM EVERYWHERE
HE FOUND JOE
HARPER STUDYING A TESTAMENT AND TURNED SADLY AWAY FROM THE DEPRESSING
SPECTACLE
HE SOUGHT BEN ROGERS AND FOUND HIM VISITING THE POOR WITH A
BASKET OF TRACTS
HE HUNTED UP JIM HOLLIS WHO CALLED HIS ATTENTION TO
THE PRECIOUS BLESSING OF HIS LATE MEASLES AS A WARNING
EVERY BOY
HE ENCOUNTERED ADDED ANOTHER TON TO HIS DEPRESSION AND WHEN IN
DESPERATION HE FLEW FOR REFUGE AT LAST TO THE BOSOM OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN
AND WAS RECEIVED WITH A SCRIPTURAL QUOTATION HIS HEART BROKE AND HE
CREPT HOME AND TO BED REALIZING THAT HE ALONE OF ALL THE TOWN WAS LOST
FOREVER AND FOREVER
AND THAT NIGHT THERE CAME ON A TERRIFIC STORM WITH DRIVING RAIN AWFUL
CLAPS OF THUNDER AND BLINDING SHEETS OF LIGHTNING
HE COVERED HIS HEAD
WITH THE BEDCLOTHES AND WAITED IN A HORROR OF SUSPENSE FOR HIS DOOM FOR
HE HAD NOT THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT ALL THIS HUBBUB WAS ABOUT HIM
HE BELIEVED HE HAD TAXED THE FORBEARANCE OF THE POWERS ABOVE TO THE
EXTREMITY OF ENDURANCE AND THAT THIS WAS THE RESULT
IT MIGHT HAVE
SEEMED TO HIM A WASTE OF POMP AND AMMUNITION TO KILL A BUG WITH A
BATTERY OF ARTILLERY BUT THERE SEEMED NOTHING INCONGRUOUS ABOUT THE
GETTING UP SUCH AN EXPENSIVE THUNDERSTORM AS THIS TO KNOCK THE TURF FROM
UNDER AN INSECT LIKE HIMSELF
BY AND BY THE TEMPEST SPENT ITSELF AND DIED WITHOUT ACCOMPLISHING ITS
OBJECT
THE BOY'S FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO BE GRATEFUL AND REFORM
HIS
SECOND WAS TO WAIT FOR THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY MORE STORMS
THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTORS WERE BACK TOM HAD RELAPSED
THE THREE WEEKS HE
SPENT ON HIS BACK THIS TIME SEEMED AN ENTIRE AGE
WHEN HE GOT ABROAD
AT LAST HE WAS HARDLY GRATEFUL THAT HE HAD BEEN SPARED REMEMBERING HOW
LONELY WAS HIS ESTATE HOW COMPANIONLESS AND FORLORN HE WAS
HE DRIFTED
LISTLESSLY DOWN THE STREET AND FOUND JIM HOLLIS ACTING AS JUDGE IN A
JUVENILE COURT THAT WAS TRYING A CAT FOR MURDER IN THE PRESENCE OF HER
VICTIM A BIRD
HE FOUND JOE HARPER AND HUCK FINN UP AN ALLEY EATING A
STOLEN MELON
POOR LADS THEY LIKE TOM HAD SUFFERED A RELAPSE
CHAPTER XXIII
AT LAST THE SLEEPY ATMOSPHERE WAS STIRRED AND VIGOROUSLY THE MURDER
TRIAL CAME ON IN THE COURT
IT BECAME THE ABSORBING TOPIC OF VILLAGE
TALK IMMEDIATELY
TOM COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM IT
EVERY REFERENCE TO
THE MURDER SENT A SHUDDER TO HIS HEART FOR HIS TROUBLED CONSCIENCE
AND FEARS ALMOST PERSUADED HIM THAT THESE REMARKS WERE PUT FORTH IN
HIS HEARING AS FEELERS HE DID NOT SEE HOW HE COULD BE SUSPECTED OF
KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER BUT STILL HE COULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE
IN THE MIDST OF THIS GOSSIP
IT KEPT HIM IN A COLD SHIVER ALL THE TIME
HE TOOK HUCK TO A LONELY PLACE TO HAVE A TALK WITH HIM
IT WOULD BE SOME
RELIEF TO UNSEAL HIS TONGUE FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO DIVIDE HIS BURDEN OF
DISTRESS WITH ANOTHER SUFFERER
MOREOVER HE WANTED TO ASSURE HIMSELF
THAT HUCK HAD REMAINED DISCREET
HUCK HAVE YOU EVER TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT THAT
'BOUT WHAT
YOU KNOW WHAT
OH 'COURSE I HAVEN'T
NEVER A WORD
NEVER A SOLITARY WORD SO HELP ME
WHAT MAKES YOU ASK
WELL I WAS AFEARD
WHY TOM SAWYER WE WOULDN'T BE ALIVE TWO DAYS IF THAT GOT FOUND OUT
YOU KNOW THAT
TOM FELT MORE COMFORTABLE
AFTER A PAUSE
HUCK THEY COULDN'T ANYBODY GET YOU TO TELL COULD THEY
GET ME TO TELL WHY IF I WANTED THAT HALFBREED DEVIL TO DROWND ME THEY
COULD GET ME TO TELL
THEY AIN'T NO DIFFERENT WAY
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN
I RECKON WE'RE SAFE AS LONG AS WE KEEP
MUM
BUT LET'S SWEAR AGAIN ANYWAY
IT'S MORE SURER
I'M AGREED
SO THEY SWORE AGAIN WITH DREAD SOLEMNITIES
WHAT IS THE TALK AROUND HUCK I'VE HEARD A POWER OF IT
TALK WELL IT'S JUST MUFF POTTER MUFF POTTER MUFF POTTER ALL THE
TIME
IT KEEPS ME IN A SWEAT CONSTANT SO'S I WANT TO HIDE SOM'ERS
THAT'S JUST THE SAME WAY THEY GO ON ROUND ME
I RECKON HE'S A GONER
DON'T YOU FEEL SORRY FOR HIM SOMETIMES
MOST ALWAYS MOST ALWAYS
HE AIN'T NO ACCOUNT BUT THEN HE HAIN'T EVER
DONE ANYTHING TO HURT ANYBODY
JUST FISHES A LITTLE TO GET MONEY TO
GET DRUNK ON AND LOAFS AROUND CONSIDERABLE BUT LORD WE ALL DO
THAT LEASTWAYS MOST OF US PREACHERS AND SUCH LIKE
BUT HE'S KIND OF
GOOD HE GIVE ME HALF A FISH ONCE WHEN THERE WARN'T ENOUGH FOR TWO AND
LOTS OF TIMES HE'S KIND OF STOOD BY ME WHEN I WAS OUT OF LUCK
WELL HE'S MENDED KITES FOR ME HUCK AND KNITTED HOOKS ON TO MY LINE
I WISH WE COULD GET HIM OUT OF THERE
MY WE COULDN'T GET HIM OUT TOM
AND BESIDES 'TWOULDN'T DO ANY GOOD
THEY'D KETCH HIM AGAIN
YES SO THEY WOULD
BUT I HATE TO HEAR 'EM ABUSE HIM SO LIKE THE DICKENS
WHEN HE NEVER DONE THAT
I DO TOO TOM
LORD I HEAR 'EM SAY HE'S THE BLOODIEST LOOKING VILLAIN
IN THIS COUNTRY AND THEY WONDER HE WASN'T EVER HUNG BEFORE
YES THEY TALK LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME
I'VE HEARD 'EM SAY THAT IF HE
WAS TO GET FREE THEY'D LYNCH HIM
AND THEY'D DO IT TOO
THE BOYS HAD A LONG TALK BUT IT BROUGHT THEM LITTLE COMFORT
AS THE
TWILIGHT DREW ON THEY FOUND THEMSELVES HANGING ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
OF THE LITTLE ISOLATED JAIL PERHAPS WITH AN UNDEFINED HOPE THAT
SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN THAT MIGHT CLEAR AWAY THEIR DIFFICULTIES
BUT
NOTHING HAPPENED THERE SEEMED TO BE NO ANGELS OR FAIRIES INTERESTED IN
THIS LUCKLESS CAPTIVE
THE BOYS DID AS THEY HAD OFTEN DONE BEFORE WENT TO THE CELL GRATING AND
GAVE POTTER SOME TOBACCO AND MATCHES
HE WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND
THERE WERE NO GUARDS
HIS GRATITUDE FOR THEIR GIFTS HAD ALWAYS SMOTE THEIR CONSCIENCES
BEFORE IT CUT DEEPER THAN EVER THIS TIME
THEY FELT COWARDLY AND
TREACHEROUS TO THE LAST DEGREE WHEN POTTER SAID
YOU'VE BEEN MIGHTY GOOD TO ME BOYS BETTER'N ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS TOWN
AND I DON'T FORGET IT I DON'T
OFTEN I SAYS TO MYSELF SAYS I 'I USED
TO MEND ALL THE BOYS' KITES AND THINGS AND SHOW 'EM WHERE THE GOOD
FISHIN' PLACES WAS AND BEFRIEND 'EM WHAT I COULD AND NOW THEY'VE
ALL FORGOT OLD MUFF WHEN HE'S IN TROUBLE BUT TOM DON'T AND HUCK
DON'T THEY DON'T FORGET HIM SAYS I 'AND I DON'T FORGET THEM WELL
BOYS I DONE AN AWFUL THING DRUNK AND CRAZY AT THE TIME THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY I ACCOUNT FOR IT AND NOW I GOT TO SWING FOR IT AND IT'S RIGHT
RIGHT AND BEST TOO I RECKON HOPE SO ANYWAY
WELL WE WON'T TALK
ABOUT THAT
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD YOU'VE BEFRIENDED ME
BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS DON'T YOU EVER GET DRUNK THEN YOU WON'T
EVER GET HERE
STAND A LITTER FURDER WEST SO THAT'S IT IT'S A PRIME
COMFORT TO SEE FACES THAT'S FRIENDLY WHEN A BODY'S IN SUCH A MUCK
OF TROUBLE AND THERE DON'T NONE COME HERE BUT YOURN
GOOD FRIENDLY
FACES GOOD FRIENDLY FACES
GIT UP ON ONE ANOTHER'S BACKS AND LET ME
TOUCH 'EM
THAT'S IT
SHAKE HANDS YOURN'LL COME THROUGH THE BARS BUT
MINE'S TOO BIG
LITTLE HANDS AND WEAK BUT THEY'VE HELPED MUFF POTTER A
POWER AND THEY'D HELP HIM MORE IF THEY COULD
TOM WENT HOME MISERABLE AND HIS DREAMS THAT NIGHT WERE FULL OF HORRORS
THE NEXT DAY AND THE DAY AFTER HE HUNG ABOUT THE COURTROOM DRAWN BY AN
ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TO GO IN BUT FORCING HIMSELF TO STAY OUT
HUCK WAS HAVING THE SAME EXPERIENCE
THEY STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED EACH OTHER
EACH WANDERED AWAY FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THE SAME DISMAL FASCINATION
ALWAYS BROUGHT THEM BACK PRESENTLY
TOM KEPT HIS EARS OPEN WHEN IDLERS
SAUNTERED OUT OF THE COURTROOM BUT INVARIABLY HEARD DISTRESSING
NEWS THE TOILS WERE CLOSING MORE AND MORE RELENTLESSLY AROUND POOR
POTTER
AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY THE VILLAGE TALK WAS TO THE EFFECT
THAT INJUN JOE'S EVIDENCE STOOD FIRM AND UNSHAKEN AND THAT THERE WAS
NOT THE SLIGHTEST QUESTION AS TO WHAT THE JURY'S VERDICT WOULD BE
TOM WAS OUT LATE THAT NIGHT AND CAME TO BED THROUGH THE WINDOW
HE
WAS IN A TREMENDOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
IT WAS HOURS BEFORE HE GOT TO
SLEEP
ALL THE VILLAGE FLOCKED TO THE COURTHOUSE THE NEXT MORNING FOR
THIS WAS TO BE THE GREAT DAY
BOTH SEXES WERE ABOUT EQUALLY REPRESENTED
IN THE PACKED AUDIENCE
AFTER A LONG WAIT THE JURY FILED IN AND TOOK
THEIR PLACES SHORTLY AFTERWARD POTTER PALE AND HAGGARD TIMID AND
HOPELESS WAS BROUGHT IN WITH CHAINS UPON HIM AND SEATED WHERE ALL
THE CURIOUS EYES COULD STARE AT HIM NO LESS CONSPICUOUS WAS INJUN JOE
STOLID AS EVER
THERE WAS ANOTHER PAUSE AND THEN THE JUDGE ARRIVED AND
THE SHERIFF PROCLAIMED THE OPENING OF THE COURT
THE USUAL WHISPERINGS
AMONG THE LAWYERS AND GATHERING TOGETHER OF PAPERS FOLLOWED
THESE
DETAILS AND ACCOMPANYING DELAYS WORKED UP AN ATMOSPHERE OF PREPARATION
THAT WAS AS IMPRESSIVE AS IT WAS FASCINATING
NOW A WITNESS WAS CALLED WHO TESTIFIED THAT HE FOUND MUFF POTTER WASHING
IN THE BROOK AT AN EARLY HOUR OF THE MORNING THAT THE MURDER WAS
DISCOVERED AND THAT HE IMMEDIATELY SNEAKED AWAY
AFTER SOME FURTHER
QUESTIONING COUNSEL FOR THE PROSECUTION SAID
TAKE THE WITNESS
THE PRISONER RAISED HIS EYES FOR A MOMENT BUT DROPPED THEM AGAIN WHEN
HIS OWN COUNSEL SAID
I HAVE NO QUESTIONS TO ASK HIM
THE NEXT WITNESS PROVED THE FINDING OF THE KNIFE NEAR THE CORPSE
COUNSEL FOR THE PROSECUTION SAID
TAKE THE WITNESS
I HAVE NO QUESTIONS TO ASK HIM POTTER'S LAWYER REPLIED
A THIRD WITNESS SWORE HE HAD OFTEN SEEN THE KNIFE IN POTTER'S
POSSESSION
TAKE THE WITNESS
COUNSEL FOR POTTER DECLINED TO QUESTION HIM
THE FACES OF THE AUDIENCE
BEGAN TO BETRAY ANNOYANCE
DID THIS ATTORNEY MEAN TO THROW AWAY HIS
CLIENT'S LIFE WITHOUT AN EFFORT
SEVERAL WITNESSES DEPOSED CONCERNING POTTER'S GUILTY BEHAVIOR WHEN
BROUGHT TO THE SCENE OF THE MURDER
THEY WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE STAND
WITHOUT BEING CROSS QUESTIONED
EVERY DETAIL OF THE DAMAGING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OCCURRED IN THE
GRAVEYARD UPON THAT MORNING WHICH ALL PRESENT REMEMBERED SO WELL WAS
BROUGHT OUT BY CREDIBLE WITNESSES BUT NONE OF THEM WERE CROSS EXAMINED
BY POTTER'S LAWYER
THE PERPLEXITY AND DISSATISFACTION OF THE HOUSE
EXPRESSED ITSELF IN MURMURS AND PROVOKED A REPROOF FROM THE BENCH
COUNSEL FOR THE PROSECUTION NOW SAID
BY THE OATHS OF CITIZENS WHOSE SIMPLE WORD IS ABOVE SUSPICION WE HAVE
FASTENED THIS AWFUL CRIME BEYOND ALL POSSIBILITY OF QUESTION UPON THE
UNHAPPY PRISONER AT THE BAR
WE REST OUR CASE HERE
A GROAN ESCAPED FROM POOR POTTER AND HE PUT HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND
ROCKED HIS BODY SOFTLY TO AND FRO WHILE A PAINFUL SILENCE REIGNED
IN THE COURTROOM
MANY MEN WERE MOVED AND MANY WOMEN'S COMPASSION
TESTIFIED ITSELF IN TEARS
COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE ROSE AND SAID
YOUR HONOR IN OUR REMARKS AT THE OPENING OF THIS TRIAL WE
FORESHADOWED OUR PURPOSE TO PROVE THAT OUR CLIENT DID THIS FEARFUL DEED
WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A BLIND AND IRRESPONSIBLE DELIRIUM PRODUCED
BY DRINK
WE HAVE CHANGED OUR MIND
WE SHALL NOT OFFER THAT PLEA THEN
TO THE CLERK CALL THOMAS SAWYER
A PUZZLED AMAZEMENT AWOKE IN EVERY FACE IN THE HOUSE NOT EVEN EXCEPTING
POTTER'S
EVERY EYE FASTENED ITSELF WITH WONDERING INTEREST UPON TOM AS
HE ROSE AND TOOK HIS PLACE UPON THE STAND
THE BOY LOOKED WILD ENOUGH
FOR HE WAS BADLY SCARED
THE OATH WAS ADMINISTERED
THOMAS SAWYER WHERE WERE YOU ON THE SEVENTEENTH OF JUNE ABOUT THE
HOUR OF MIDNIGHT
TOM GLANCED AT INJUN JOE'S IRON FACE AND HIS TONGUE FAILED HIM
THE
AUDIENCE LISTENED BREATHLESS BUT THE WORDS REFUSED TO COME
AFTER A FEW
MOMENTS HOWEVER THE BOY GOT A LITTLE OF HIS STRENGTH BACK AND MANAGED
TO PUT ENOUGH OF IT INTO HIS VOICE TO MAKE PART OF THE HOUSE HEAR
IN THE GRAVEYARD
A LITTLE BIT LOUDER PLEASE
DON'T BE AFRAID
YOU WERE
IN THE GRAVEYARD
A CONTEMPTUOUS SMILE FLITTED ACROSS INJUN JOE'S FACE
WERE YOU ANYWHERE NEAR HORSE WILLIAMS' GRAVE
YES SIR
SPEAK UP JUST A TRIFLE LOUDER
HOW NEAR WERE YOU
NEAR AS I AM TO YOU
WERE YOU HIDDEN OR NOT
I WAS HID
WHERE
BEHIND THE ELMS THAT'S ON THE EDGE OF THE GRAVE
INJUN JOE GAVE A BARELY PERCEPTIBLE START
ANY ONE WITH YOU
YES SIR
I WENT THERE WITH
WAIT WAIT A MOMENT
NEVER MIND MENTIONING YOUR COMPANION'S NAME
WE
WILL PRODUCE HIM AT THE PROPER TIME
DID YOU CARRY ANYTHING THERE WITH
YOU
TOM HESITATED AND LOOKED CONFUSED
SPEAK OUT MY BOY DON'T BE DIFFIDENT
THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS RESPECTABLE
WHAT DID YOU TAKE THERE
ONLY A A DEAD CAT
THERE WAS A RIPPLE OF MIRTH WHICH THE COURT CHECKED
WE WILL PRODUCE THE SKELETON OF THAT CAT
NOW MY BOY TELL US
EVERYTHING THAT OCCURRED TELL IT IN YOUR OWN WAY DON'T SKIP ANYTHING
AND DON'T BE AFRAID
TOM BEGAN HESITATINGLY AT FIRST BUT AS HE WARMED TO HIS SUBJECT HIS
WORDS FLOWED MORE AND MORE EASILY IN A LITTLE WHILE EVERY SOUND CEASED
BUT HIS OWN VOICE EVERY EYE FIXED ITSELF UPON HIM WITH PARTED LIPS AND
BATED BREATH THE AUDIENCE HUNG UPON HIS WORDS TAKING NO NOTE OF TIME
RAPT IN THE GHASTLY FASCINATIONS OF THE TALE
THE STRAIN UPON PENT
EMOTION REACHED ITS CLIMAX WHEN THE BOY SAID
AND AS THE DOCTOR FETCHED THE BOARD AROUND AND MUFF POTTER FELL INJUN
JOE JUMPED WITH THE KNIFE AND
CRASH QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE HALFBREED SPRANG FOR A WINDOW TORE HIS
WAY THROUGH ALL OPPOSERS AND WAS GONE
CHAPTER XXIV
TOM WAS A GLITTERING HERO ONCE MORE THE PET OF THE OLD THE ENVY OF THE
YOUNG
HIS NAME EVEN WENT INTO IMMORTAL PRINT FOR THE VILLAGE PAPER
MAGNIFIED HIM
THERE WERE SOME THAT BELIEVED HE WOULD BE PRESIDENT YET
IF HE ESCAPED HANGING
AS USUAL THE FICKLE UNREASONING WORLD TOOK MUFF POTTER TO ITS BOSOM
AND FONDLED HIM AS LAVISHLY AS IT HAD ABUSED HIM BEFORE
BUT THAT SORT
OF CONDUCT IS TO THE WORLD'S CREDIT THEREFORE IT IS NOT WELL TO FIND
FAULT WITH IT
TOM'S DAYS WERE DAYS OF SPLENDOR AND EXULTATION TO HIM BUT HIS NIGHTS
WERE SEASONS OF HORROR
INJUN JOE INFESTED ALL HIS DREAMS AND ALWAYS
WITH DOOM IN HIS EYE
HARDLY ANY TEMPTATION COULD PERSUADE THE BOY
TO STIR ABROAD AFTER NIGHTFALL
POOR HUCK WAS IN THE SAME STATE OF
WRETCHEDNESS AND TERROR FOR TOM HAD TOLD THE WHOLE STORY TO THE LAWYER
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE GREAT DAY OF THE TRIAL AND HUCK WAS SORE AFRAID
THAT HIS SHARE IN THE BUSINESS MIGHT LEAK OUT YET NOTWITHSTANDING
INJUN JOE'S FLIGHT HAD SAVED HIM THE SUFFERING OF TESTIFYING IN COURT
THE POOR FELLOW HAD GOT THE ATTORNEY TO PROMISE SECRECY BUT WHAT OF
THAT SINCE TOM'S HARASSED CONSCIENCE HAD MANAGED TO DRIVE HIM TO THE
LAWYER'S HOUSE BY NIGHT AND WRING A DREAD TALE FROM LIPS THAT HAD
BEEN SEALED WITH THE DISMALEST AND MOST FORMIDABLE OF OATHS HUCK'S
CONFIDENCE IN THE HUMAN RACE WAS WELLNIGH OBLITERATED
DAILY MUFF POTTER'S GRATITUDE MADE TOM GLAD HE HAD SPOKEN BUT NIGHTLY
HE WISHED HE HAD SEALED UP HIS TONGUE
HALF THE TIME TOM WAS AFRAID INJUN JOE WOULD NEVER BE CAPTURED THE
OTHER HALF HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD BE
HE FELT SURE HE NEVER COULD DRAW A
SAFE BREATH AGAIN UNTIL THAT MAN WAS DEAD AND HE HAD SEEN THE CORPSE
REWARDS HAD BEEN OFFERED THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN SCOURED BUT NO INJUN
JOE WAS FOUND
ONE OF THOSE OMNISCIENT AND AWEINSPIRING MARVELS A
DETECTIVE CAME UP FROM ST
LOUIS MOUSED AROUND SHOOK HIS HEAD LOOKED
WISE AND MADE THAT SORT OF ASTOUNDING SUCCESS WHICH MEMBERS OF THAT
CRAFT USUALLY ACHIEVE
THAT IS TO SAY HE FOUND A CLEW BUT YOU CAN'T
HANG A CLEW FOR MURDER AND SO AFTER THAT DETECTIVE HAD GOT THROUGH
AND GONE HOME TOM FELT JUST AS INSECURE AS HE WAS BEFORE
THE SLOW DAYS DRIFTED ON AND EACH LEFT BEHIND IT A SLIGHTLY LIGHTENED
WEIGHT OF APPREHENSION
CHAPTER XXV
THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERY RIGHTLY CONSTRUCTED BOY'S LIFE WHEN HE HAS
A RAGING DESIRE TO GO SOMEWHERE AND DIG FOR HIDDEN TREASURE
THIS DESIRE
SUDDENLY CAME UPON TOM ONE DAY
HE SALLIED OUT TO FIND JOE HARPER
BUT FAILED OF SUCCESS
NEXT HE SOUGHT BEN ROGERS HE HAD GONE FISHING
PRESENTLY HE STUMBLED UPON HUCK FINN THE RED HANDED
HUCK WOULD
ANSWER
TOM TOOK HIM TO A PRIVATE PLACE AND OPENED THE MATTER TO HIM
CONFIDENTIALLY
HUCK WAS WILLING
HUCK WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE A HAND
IN ANY ENTERPRISE THAT OFFERED ENTERTAINMENT AND REQUIRED NO CAPITAL
FOR HE HAD A TROUBLESOME SUPERABUNDANCE OF THAT SORT OF TIME WHICH IS
NOT MONEY
WHERE'LL WE DIG SAID HUCK
OH MOST ANYWHERE
WHY IS IT HID ALL AROUND
NO INDEED IT AIN'T
IT'S HID IN MIGHTY PARTICULAR PLACES
HUCK SOMETIMES ON ISLANDS SOMETIMES IN ROTTEN CHESTS UNDER THE END OF
A LIMB OF AN OLD DEAD TREE JUST WHERE THE SHADOW FALLS AT MIDNIGHT BUT
MOSTLY UNDER THE FLOOR IN HA'NTED HOUSES
WHO HIDES IT
WHY ROBBERS OF COURSE WHO'D YOU RECKON SUNDAY SCHOOL
SUP'RINTENDENTS
I DON'T KNOW
IF 'TWAS MINE I WOULDN'T HIDE IT I'D SPEND IT AND HAVE A
GOOD TIME
SO WOULD I
BUT ROBBERS DON'T DO THAT WAY
THEY ALWAYS HIDE IT AND
LEAVE IT THERE
DON'T THEY COME AFTER IT ANY MORE
NO THEY THINK THEY WILL BUT THEY GENERALLY FORGET THE MARKS OR ELSE
THEY DIE
ANYWAY IT LAYS THERE A LONG TIME AND GETS RUSTY AND BY AND
BY SOMEBODY FINDS AN OLD YELLOW PAPER THAT TELLS HOW TO FIND THE MARKS A
PAPER THAT'S GOT TO BE CIPHERED OVER ABOUT A WEEK BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY
SIGNS AND HY'ROGLYPHICS
HYRO WHICH
HY'ROGLYPHICS PICTURES AND THINGS YOU KNOW THAT DON'T SEEM TO MEAN
ANYTHING
HAVE YOU GOT ONE OF THEM PAPERS TOM
NO
WELL THEN HOW YOU GOING TO FIND THE MARKS
I DON'T WANT ANY MARKS
THEY ALWAYS BURY IT UNDER A HA'NTED HOUSE OR ON
AN ISLAND OR UNDER A DEAD TREE THAT'S GOT ONE LIMB STICKING OUT
WELL
WE'VE TRIED JACKSON'S ISLAND A LITTLE AND WE CAN TRY IT AGAIN SOME
TIME AND THERE'S THE OLD HA'NTED HOUSE UP THE STILL HOUSE BRANCH AND
THERE'S LOTS OF DEAD LIMB TREES DEAD LOADS OF 'EM

GO FOR ALL OF 'EM
WHY TOM IT'LL TAKE ALL SUMMER
WELL WHAT OF THAT SUPPOSE YOU FIND A BRASS POT WITH A HUNDRED DOLLARS

PLENTY BULLY ENOUGH FOR ME
JUST YOU GIMME THE HUNDRED
DOLLARS AND I DON'T WANT NO DI'MONDS
ALL RIGHT
BUT I BET YOU I AIN'T GOING TO THROW OFF ON DI'MONDS
SOME

WORTH SIX BITS OR A DOLLAR
NO IS THAT SO
CERT'NLY ANYBODY'LL TELL YOU SO
HAIN'T YOU EVER SEEN ONE HUCK
NOT AS I REMEMBER
OH KINGS HAVE SLATHERS OF THEM
WELL I DON' KNOW NO KINGS TOM

WELL WHAT DID YOU SAY THEY DID FOR
SHUCKS I ONLY MEANT YOU'D SEE 'EM NOT HOPPING OF COURSE WHAT DO
THEY WANT TO HOP FOR BUT I MEAN YOU'D JUST SEE 'EM SCATTERED AROUND
YOU KNOW IN A KIND OF A GENERAL WAY
LIKE THAT OLD HUMPBACKED RICHARD
RICHARD WHAT'S HIS OTHER NAME
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER NAME
KINGS DON'T HAVE ANY BUT A GIVEN NAME
NO
BUT THEY DON'T
WELL IF THEY LIKE IT TOM ALL RIGHT BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A KING
AND HAVE ONLY JUST A GIVEN NAME LIKE A NIGGER
BUT SAY WHERE YOU GOING
TO DIG FIRST
WELL I DON'T KNOW
S'POSE WE TACKLE THAT OLD DEAD LIMB TREE ON THE
HILL T'OTHER SIDE OF STILL HOUSE BRANCH
I'M AGREED
SO THEY GOT A CRIPPLED PICK AND A SHOVEL AND SET OUT ON THEIR
THREE MILE TRAMP
THEY ARRIVED HOT AND PANTING AND THREW THEMSELVES
DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A NEIGHBORING ELM TO REST AND HAVE A SMOKE
I LIKE THIS SAID TOM
SO DO I
SAY HUCK IF WE FIND A TREASURE HERE WHAT YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR
SHARE
WELL I'LL HAVE PIE AND A GLASS OF SODA EVERY DAY AND I'LL GO TO EVERY
CIRCUS THAT COMES ALONG
I BET I'LL HAVE A GAY TIME

THEY TOILED ANOTHER
HALFHOUR
STILL NO RESULT
HUCK SAID
DO THEY ALWAYS BURY IT AS DEEP AS THIS
SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS
NOT GENERALLY
I RECKON WE HAVEN'T GOT THE RIGHT
PLACE
SO THEY CHOSE A NEW SPOT AND BEGAN AGAIN
THE LABOR DRAGGED A LITTLE
BUT STILL THEY MADE PROGRESS
THEY PEGGED AWAY IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME
FINALLY HUCK LEANED ON HIS SHOVEL SWABBED THE BEADED DROPS FROM HIS
BROW WITH HIS SLEEVE AND SAID
WHERE YOU GOING TO DIG NEXT AFTER WE GET THIS ONE
I RECKON MAYBE WE'LL TACKLE THE OLD TREE THAT'S OVER YONDER ON CARDIFF
HILL BACK OF THE WIDOW'S
I RECKON THAT'LL BE A GOOD ONE
BUT WON'T THE WIDOW TAKE IT AWAY FROM
US TOM IT'S ON HER LAND
SHE TAKE IT AWAY MAYBE SHE'D LIKE TO TRY IT ONCE
WHOEVER FINDS ONE
OF THESE HID TREASURES IT BELONGS TO HIM
IT DON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
WHOSE LAND IT'S ON
THAT WAS SATISFACTORY
THE WORK WENT ON
BY AND BY HUCK SAID
BLAME IT WE MUST BE IN THE WRONG PLACE AGAIN
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT IS MIGHTY CURIOUS HUCK
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
SOMETIMES WITCHES
INTERFERE
I RECKON MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S THE TROUBLE NOW
SHUCKS WITCHES AIN'T GOT NO POWER IN THE DAYTIME
WELL THAT'S SO
I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT
OH I KNOW WHAT THE MATTER IS
WHAT A BLAMED LOT OF FOOLS WE ARE YOU GOT TO FIND OUT WHERE THE SHADOW
OF THE LIMB FALLS AT MIDNIGHT AND THAT'S WHERE YOU DIG
THEN CONSOUND IT WE'VE FOOLED AWAY ALL THIS WORK FOR NOTHING
NOW HANG
IT ALL WE GOT TO COME BACK IN THE NIGHT
IT'S AN AWFUL LONG WAY
CAN
YOU GET OUT
I BET I WILL
WE'VE GOT TO DO IT TONIGHT TOO BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY SEES
THESE HOLES THEY'LL KNOW IN A MINUTE WHAT'S HERE AND THEY'LL GO FOR IT
WELL I'LL COME AROUND AND MAOW TONIGHT
ALL RIGHT
LET'S HIDE THE TOOLS IN THE BUSHES
THE BOYS WERE THERE THAT NIGHT ABOUT THE APPOINTED TIME
THEY SAT IN
THE SHADOW WAITING
IT WAS A LONELY PLACE AND AN HOUR MADE SOLEMN BY
OLD TRADITIONS
SPIRITS WHISPERED IN THE RUSTLING LEAVES GHOSTS LURKED
IN THE MURKY NOOKS THE DEEP BAYING OF A HOUND FLOATED UP OUT OF THE
DISTANCE AN OWL ANSWERED WITH HIS SEPULCHRAL NOTE
THE BOYS WERE
SUBDUED BY THESE SOLEMNITIES AND TALKED LITTLE
BY AND BY THEY JUDGED
THAT TWELVE HAD COME THEY MARKED WHERE THE SHADOW FELL AND BEGAN TO
DIG
THEIR HOPES COMMENCED TO RISE
THEIR INTEREST GREW STRONGER AND
THEIR INDUSTRY KEPT PACE WITH IT
THE HOLE DEEPENED AND STILL DEEPENED
BUT EVERY TIME THEIR HEARTS JUMPED TO HEAR THE PICK STRIKE UPON
SOMETHING THEY ONLY SUFFERED A NEW DISAPPOINTMENT
IT WAS ONLY A STONE
OR A CHUNK
AT LAST TOM SAID
IT AIN'T ANY USE HUCK WE'RE WRONG AGAIN
WELL BUT WE CAN'T BE WRONG
WE SPOTTED THE SHADDER TO A DOT
I KNOW IT BUT THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THING
WHAT'S THAT
WHY WE ONLY GUESSED AT THE TIME
LIKE ENOUGH IT WAS TOO LATE OR TOO
EARLY
HUCK DROPPED HIS SHOVEL
THAT'S IT SAID HE
THAT'S THE VERY TROUBLE
WE GOT TO GIVE THIS ONE
UP
WE CAN'T EVER TELL THE RIGHT TIME AND BESIDES THIS KIND OF THING'S
TOO AWFUL HERE THIS TIME OF NIGHT WITH WITCHES AND GHOSTS A FLUTTERING
AROUND SO
I FEEL AS IF SOMETHING'S BEHIND ME ALL THE TIME AND I'M
AFEARD TO TURN AROUND BECUZ MAYBE THERE'S OTHERS IN FRONT A WAITING FOR
A CHANCE
I BEEN CREEPING ALL OVER EVER SINCE I GOT HERE
WELL I'VE BEEN PRETTY MUCH SO TOO HUCK
THEY MOST ALWAYS PUT IN A
DEAD MAN WHEN THEY BURY A TREASURE UNDER A TREE TO LOOK OUT FOR IT
LORDY
YES THEY DO
I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT
TOM I DON'T LIKE TO FOOL AROUND MUCH WHERE THERE'S DEAD PEOPLE
A
BODY'S BOUND TO GET INTO TROUBLE WITH 'EM SURE
I DON'T LIKE TO STIR 'EM UP EITHER
S'POSE THIS ONE HERE WAS TO STICK
HIS SKULL OUT AND SAY SOMETHING
DON'T TOM IT'S AWFUL
WELL IT JUST IS
HUCK I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE A BIT
SAY TOM LET'S GIVE THIS PLACE UP AND TRY SOMEWHERES ELSE
ALL RIGHT I RECKON WE BETTER
WHAT'LL IT BE
TOM CONSIDERED AWHILE AND THEN SAID
THE HA'NTED HOUSE
THAT'S IT
BLAME IT I DON'T LIKE HA'NTED HOUSES TOM
WHY THEY'RE A DERN SIGHT
WORSE'N DEAD PEOPLE
DEAD PEOPLE MIGHT TALK MAYBE BUT THEY DON'T COME
SLIDING AROUND IN A SHROUD WHEN YOU AIN'T NOTICING AND PEEP OVER YOUR
SHOULDER ALL OF A SUDDEN AND GRIT THEIR TEETH THE WAY A GHOST DOES
I
COULDN'T STAND SUCH A THING AS THAT TOM NOBODY COULD
YES BUT HUCK GHOSTS DON'T TRAVEL AROUND ONLY AT NIGHT
THEY WON'T
HENDER US FROM DIGGING THERE IN THE DAYTIME
WELL THAT'S SO
BUT YOU KNOW MIGHTY WELL PEOPLE DON'T GO ABOUT THAT
HA'NTED HOUSE IN THE DAY NOR THE NIGHT
WELL THAT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE TO GO WHERE A MAN'S BEEN
MURDERED ANYWAY BUT NOTHING'S EVER BEEN SEEN AROUND THAT HOUSE EXCEPT
IN THE NIGHT JUST SOME BLUE LIGHTS SLIPPING BY THE WINDOWS NO REGULAR
GHOSTS
WELL WHERE YOU SEE ONE OF THEM BLUE LIGHTS FLICKERING AROUND TOM
YOU CAN BET THERE'S A GHOST MIGHTY CLOSE BEHIND IT
IT STANDS TO REASON
BECUZ YOU KNOW THAT THEY DON'T ANYBODY BUT GHOSTS USE 'EM
YES THAT'S SO
BUT ANYWAY THEY DON'T COME AROUND IN THE DAYTIME SO
WHAT'S THE USE OF OUR BEING AFEARD
WELL ALL RIGHT
WE'LL TACKLE THE HA'NTED HOUSE IF YOU SAY SO BUT I
RECKON IT'S TAKING CHANCES
THEY HAD STARTED DOWN THE HILL BY THIS TIME
THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
MOONLIT VALLEY BELOW THEM STOOD THE HA'NTED HOUSE UTTERLY ISOLATED
ITS FENCES GONE LONG AGO RANK WEEDS SMOTHERING THE VERY DOORSTEPS THE
CHIMNEY CRUMBLED TO RUIN THE WINDOW SASHES VACANT A CORNER OF THE ROOF
CAVED IN
THE BOYS GAZED AWHILE HALF EXPECTING TO SEE A BLUE LIGHT FLIT
PAST A WINDOW THEN TALKING IN A LOW TONE AS BEFITTED THE TIME AND THE
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY STRUCK FAR OFF TO THE RIGHT TO GIVE THE HAUNTED
HOUSE A WIDE BERTH AND TOOK THEIR WAY HOMEWARD THROUGH THE WOODS THAT
ADORNED THE REARWARD SIDE OF CARDIFF HILL
CHAPTER XVI
ABOUT NOON THE NEXT DAY THE BOYS ARRIVED AT THE DEAD TREE THEY HAD COME
FOR THEIR TOOLS
TOM WAS IMPATIENT TO GO TO THE HAUNTED HOUSE HUCK WAS
MEASURABLY SO ALSO BUT SUDDENLY SAID
LOOKYHERE TOM DO YOU KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS
TOM MENTALLY RAN OVER THE DAYS OF THE WEEK AND THEN QUICKLY LIFTED HIS
EYES WITH A STARTLED LOOK IN THEM
MY I NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF IT HUCK
WELL I DIDN'T NEITHER BUT ALL AT ONCE IT POPPED ONTO ME THAT IT WAS
FRIDAY
BLAME IT A BODY CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL HUCK
WE MIGHT 'A' GOT INTO AN
AWFUL SCRAPE TACKLING SUCH A THING ON A FRIDAY
MIGHT BETTER SAY WE WOULD THERE'S SOME LUCKY DAYS MAYBE BUT
FRIDAY AIN'T
ANY FOOL KNOWS THAT
I DON'T RECKON YOU WAS THE FIRST THAT FOUND IT
OUT HUCK
WELL I NEVER SAID I WAS DID I AND FRIDAY AIN'T ALL NEITHER
I HAD A
ROTTEN BAD DREAM LAST NIGHT DREAMPT ABOUT RATS
NO SURE SIGN OF TROUBLE
DID THEY FIGHT
NO
WELL THAT'S GOOD HUCK
WHEN THEY DON'T FIGHT IT'S ONLY A SIGN THAT
THERE'S TROUBLE AROUND YOU KNOW
ALL WE GOT TO DO IS TO LOOK MIGHTY
SHARP AND KEEP OUT OF IT
WE'LL DROP THIS THING FOR TODAY AND PLAY
DO
YOU KNOW ROBIN HOOD HUCK
NO
WHO'S ROBIN HOOD
WHY HE WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN THAT WAS EVER IN ENGLAND AND THE
BEST
HE WAS A ROBBER
CRACKY I WISHT I WAS
WHO DID HE ROB
ONLY SHERIFFS AND BISHOPS AND RICH PEOPLE AND KINGS AND SUCH LIKE
BUT
HE NEVER BOTHERED THE POOR
HE LOVED 'EM
HE ALWAYS DIVIDED UP WITH 'EM
PERFECTLY SQUARE
WELL HE MUST 'A' BEEN A BRICK
I BET YOU HE WAS HUCK
OH HE WAS THE NOBLEST MAN THAT EVER WAS
THEY AIN'T ANY SUCH MEN NOW I CAN TELL YOU
HE COULD LICK ANY MAN IN
ENGLAND WITH ONE HAND TIED BEHIND HIM AND HE COULD TAKE HIS YEW BOW
AND PLUG A TEN CENT PIECE EVERY TIME A MILE AND A HALF
WHAT'S A YEW BOW
I DON'T KNOW
IT'S SOME KIND OF A BOW OF COURSE
AND IF HE HIT THAT
DIME ONLY ON THE EDGE HE WOULD SET DOWN AND CRY AND CURSE
BUT WE'LL
PLAY ROBIN HOOD IT'S NOBBY FUN
I'LL LEARN YOU
I'M AGREED
SO THEY PLAYED ROBIN HOOD ALL THE AFTERNOON NOW AND THEN CASTING A
YEARNING EYE DOWN UPON THE HAUNTED HOUSE AND PASSING A REMARK ABOUT THE
MORROW'S PROSPECTS AND POSSIBILITIES THERE
AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK
INTO THE WEST THEY TOOK THEIR WAY HOMEWARD ATHWART THE LONG SHADOWS
OF THE TREES AND SOON WERE BURIED FROM SIGHT IN THE FORESTS OF CARDIFF
HILL
ON SATURDAY SHORTLY AFTER NOON THE BOYS WERE AT THE DEAD TREE AGAIN
THEY HAD A SMOKE AND A CHAT IN THE SHADE AND THEN DUG A LITTLE IN THEIR
LAST HOLE NOT WITH GREAT HOPE BUT MERELY BECAUSE TOM SAID THERE WERE
SO MANY CASES WHERE PEOPLE HAD GIVEN UP A TREASURE AFTER GETTING DOWN
WITHIN SIX INCHES OF IT AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE HAD COME ALONG AND
TURNED IT UP WITH A SINGLE THRUST OF A SHOVEL
THE THING FAILED THIS
TIME HOWEVER SO THE BOYS SHOULDERED THEIR TOOLS AND WENT AWAY FEELING
THAT THEY HAD NOT TRIFLED WITH FORTUNE BUT HAD FULFILLED ALL THE
REQUIREMENTS THAT BELONG TO THE BUSINESS OF TREASURE HUNTING
WHEN THEY REACHED THE HAUNTED HOUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING SO WEIRD AND
GRISLY ABOUT THE DEAD SILENCE THAT REIGNED THERE UNDER THE BAKING SUN
AND SOMETHING SO DEPRESSING ABOUT THE LONELINESS AND DESOLATION OF THE
PLACE THAT THEY WERE AFRAID FOR A MOMENT TO VENTURE IN
THEN THEY
CREPT TO THE DOOR AND TOOK A TREMBLING PEEP
THEY SAW A WEEDGROWN
FLOORLESS ROOM UNPLASTERED AN ANCIENT FIREPLACE VACANT WINDOWS
A RUINOUS STAIRCASE AND HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE HUNG RAGGED AND
ABANDONED COBWEBS
THEY PRESENTLY ENTERED SOFTLY WITH QUICKENED
PULSES TALKING IN WHISPERS EARS ALERT TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
AND MUSCLES TENSE AND READY FOR INSTANT RETREAT
IN A LITTLE WHILE FAMILIARITY MODIFIED THEIR FEARS AND THEY GAVE THE
PLACE A CRITICAL AND INTERESTED EXAMINATION RATHER ADMIRING THEIR OWN
BOLDNESS AND WONDERING AT IT TOO
NEXT THEY WANTED TO LOOK UPSTAIRS
THIS WAS SOMETHING LIKE CUTTING OFF RETREAT BUT THEY GOT TO DARING
EACH OTHER AND OF COURSE THERE COULD BE BUT ONE RESULT THEY THREW THEIR
TOOLS INTO A CORNER AND MADE THE ASCENT
UP THERE WERE THE SAME SIGNS OF
DECAY
IN ONE CORNER THEY FOUND A CLOSET THAT PROMISED MYSTERY BUT THE
PROMISE WAS A FRAUD THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT
THEIR COURAGE WAS UP NOW
AND WELL IN HAND
THEY WERE ABOUT TO GO DOWN AND BEGIN WORK WHEN
SH SAID TOM
WHAT IS IT WHISPERED HUCK BLANCHING WITH FRIGHT
SH
THERE
HEAR IT
YES
OH MY LET'S RUN
KEEP STILL DON'T YOU BUDGE THEY'RE COMING RIGHT TOWARD THE DOOR
THE BOYS STRETCHED THEMSELVES UPON THE FLOOR WITH THEIR EYES TO
KNOTHOLES IN THE PLANKING AND LAY WAITING IN A MISERY OF FEAR
THEY'VE STOPPED
NO COMING
HERE THEY ARE
DON'T WHISPER ANOTHER
WORD HUCK
MY GOODNESS I WISH I WAS OUT OF THIS
TWO MEN ENTERED
EACH BOY SAID TO HIMSELF THERE'S THE OLD DEAF AND
DUMB SPANIARD THAT'S BEEN ABOUT TOWN ONCE OR TWICE LATELY NEVER SAW
T'OTHER MAN BEFORE
T'OTHER WAS A RAGGED UNKEMPT CREATURE WITH NOTHING VERY PLEASANT
IN HIS FACE
THE SPANIARD WAS WRAPPED IN A SERAPE HE HAD BUSHY WHITE
WHISKERS LONG WHITE HAIR FLOWED FROM UNDER HIS SOMBRERO AND HE WORE
GREEN GOGGLES
WHEN THEY CAME IN T'OTHER WAS TALKING IN A LOW VOICE
THEY SAT DOWN ON THE GROUND FACING THE DOOR WITH THEIR BACKS TO THE
WALL AND THE SPEAKER CONTINUED HIS REMARKS
HIS MANNER BECAME LESS
GUARDED AND HIS WORDS MORE DISTINCT AS HE PROCEEDED
NO SAID HE I'VE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER AND I DON'T LIKE IT
IT'S
DANGEROUS
DANGEROUS GRUNTED THE DEAF AND DUMB SPANIARD TO THE VAST SURPRISE
OF THE BOYS
MILKSOP
THIS VOICE MADE THE BOYS GASP AND QUAKE
IT WAS INJUN JOE'S THERE WAS
SILENCE FOR SOME TIME
THEN JOE SAID
WHAT'S ANY MORE DANGEROUS THAN THAT JOB UP YONDER BUT NOTHING'S COME OF
IT
THAT'S DIFFERENT
AWAY UP THE RIVER SO AND NOT ANOTHER HOUSE ABOUT
'TWON'T EVER BE KNOWN THAT WE TRIED ANYWAY LONG AS WE DIDN'T SUCCEED
WELL WHAT'S MORE DANGEROUS THAN COMING HERE IN THE DAYTIME ANYBODY
WOULD SUSPICION US THAT SAW US
I KNOW THAT
BUT THERE WARN'T ANY OTHER PLACE AS HANDY AFTER THAT FOOL
OF A JOB
I WANT TO QUIT THIS SHANTY
I WANTED TO YESTERDAY ONLY IT
WARN'T ANY USE TRYING TO STIR OUT OF HERE WITH THOSE INFERNAL BOYS
PLAYING OVER THERE ON THE HILL RIGHT IN FULL VIEW
THOSE INFERNAL BOYS QUAKED AGAIN UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF THIS REMARK
AND THOUGHT HOW LUCKY IT WAS THAT THEY HAD REMEMBERED IT WAS FRIDAY AND
CONCLUDED TO WAIT A DAY
THEY WISHED IN THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD WAITED A
YEAR
THE TWO MEN GOT OUT SOME FOOD AND MADE A LUNCHEON
AFTER A LONG AND
THOUGHTFUL SILENCE INJUN JOE SAID
LOOK HERE LAD YOU GO BACK UP THE RIVER WHERE YOU BELONG
WAIT THERE
TILL YOU HEAR FROM ME
I'LL TAKE THE CHANCES ON DROPPING INTO THIS TOWN
JUST ONCE MORE FOR A LOOK
WE'LL DO THAT 'DANGEROUS' JOB AFTER I'VE
SPIED AROUND A LITTLE AND THINK THINGS LOOK WELL FOR IT
THEN FOR TEXAS
WE'LL LEG IT TOGETHER
THIS WAS SATISFACTORY
BOTH MEN PRESENTLY FELL TO YAWNING AND INJUN JOE
SAID
I'M DEAD FOR SLEEP IT'S YOUR TURN TO WATCH
HE CURLED DOWN IN THE WEEDS AND SOON BEGAN TO SNORE
HIS COMRADE STIRRED
HIM ONCE OR TWICE AND HE BECAME QUIET
PRESENTLY THE WATCHER BEGAN TO
NOD HIS HEAD DROOPED LOWER AND LOWER BOTH MEN BEGAN TO SNORE NOW
THE BOYS DREW A LONG GRATEFUL BREATH
TOM WHISPERED
NOW'S OUR CHANCE COME
HUCK SAID
I CAN'T I'D DIE IF THEY WAS TO WAKE
TOM URGED HUCK HELD BACK
AT LAST TOM ROSE SLOWLY AND SOFTLY AND
STARTED ALONE
BUT THE FIRST STEP HE MADE WRUNG SUCH A HIDEOUS CREAK
FROM THE CRAZY FLOOR THAT HE SANK DOWN ALMOST DEAD WITH FRIGHT
HE NEVER
MADE A SECOND ATTEMPT
THE BOYS LAY THERE COUNTING THE DRAGGING MOMENTS
TILL IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT TIME MUST BE DONE AND ETERNITY GROWING GRAY
AND THEN THEY WERE GRATEFUL TO NOTE THAT AT LAST THE SUN WAS SETTING
NOW ONE SNORE CEASED
INJUN JOE SAT UP STARED AROUND SMILED GRIMLY UPON
HIS COMRADE WHOSE HEAD WAS DROOPING UPON HIS KNEES STIRRED HIM UP WITH
HIS FOOT AND SAID
HERE YOU'RE A WATCHMAN AIN'T YOU ALL RIGHT THOUGH NOTHING'S
HAPPENED
MY HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP
OH PARTLY PARTLY
NEARLY TIME FOR US TO BE MOVING PARD
WHAT'LL WE
DO WITH WHAT LITTLE SWAG WE'VE GOT LEFT
I DON'T KNOW LEAVE IT HERE AS WE'VE ALWAYS DONE I RECKON
NO USE TO
TAKE IT AWAY TILL WE START SOUTH
SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN SILVER'S
SOMETHING TO CARRY
WELL ALL RIGHT IT WON'T MATTER TO COME HERE ONCE MORE
NO BUT I'D SAY COME IN THE NIGHT AS WE USED TO DO IT'S BETTER
YES BUT LOOK HERE IT MAY BE A GOOD WHILE BEFORE I GET THE RIGHT
CHANCE AT THAT JOB ACCIDENTS MIGHT HAPPEN 'TAIN'T IN SUCH A VERY GOOD
PLACE WE'LL JUST REGULARLY BURY IT AND BURY IT DEEP
GOOD IDEA SAID THE COMRADE WHO WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM KNELT DOWN
RAISED ONE OF THE REARWARD HEARTH STONES AND TOOK OUT A BAG THAT JINGLED
PLEASANTLY
HE SUBTRACTED FROM IT TWENTY OR THIRTY DOLLARS FOR HIMSELF
AND AS MUCH FOR INJUN JOE AND PASSED THE BAG TO THE LATTER WHO WAS ON
HIS KNEES IN THE CORNER NOW DIGGING WITH HIS BOWIE KNIFE
THE BOYS FORGOT ALL THEIR FEARS ALL THEIR MISERIES IN AN INSTANT
WITH
GLOATING EYES THEY WATCHED EVERY MOVEMENT
LUCK THE SPLENDOR OF IT WAS
BEYOND ALL IMAGINATION SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS MONEY ENOUGH TO MAKE
HALF A DOZEN BOYS RICH HERE WAS TREASURE HUNTING UNDER THE HAPPIEST
AUSPICES THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY BOTHERSOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHERE TO
DIG
THEY NUDGED EACH OTHER EVERY MOMENT ELOQUENT NUDGES AND EASILY
UNDERSTOOD FOR THEY SIMPLY MEANT OH BUT AIN'T YOU GLAD NOW WE'RE
HERE
JOE'S KNIFE STRUCK UPON SOMETHING
HELLO SAID HE
WHAT IS IT SAID HIS COMRADE
HALF ROTTEN PLANK NO IT'S A BOX I BELIEVE
HERE BEAR A HAND AND WE'LL
SEE WHAT IT'S HERE FOR
NEVER MIND I'VE BROKE A HOLE
HE REACHED HIS HAND IN AND DREW IT OUT
MAN IT'S MONEY
THE TWO MEN EXAMINED THE HANDFUL OF COINS
THEY WERE GOLD
THE BOYS
ABOVE WERE AS EXCITED AS THEMSELVES AND AS DELIGHTED
JOE'S COMRADE SAID
WE'LL MAKE QUICK WORK OF THIS
THERE'S AN OLD RUSTY PICK OVER AMONGST
THE WEEDS IN THE CORNER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE I SAW IT A
MINUTE AGO
HE RAN AND BROUGHT THE BOYS' PICK AND SHOVEL
INJUN JOE TOOK THE
PICK LOOKED IT OVER CRITICALLY SHOOK HIS HEAD MUTTERED SOMETHING TO
HIMSELF AND THEN BEGAN TO USE IT
THE BOX WAS SOON UNEARTHED
IT WAS
NOT VERY LARGE IT WAS IRON BOUND AND HAD BEEN VERY STRONG BEFORE THE
SLOW YEARS HAD INJURED IT
THE MEN CONTEMPLATED THE TREASURE AWHILE IN
BLISSFUL SILENCE
PARD THERE'S THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS HERE SAID INJUN JOE
'TWAS ALWAYS SAID THAT MURREL'S GANG USED TO BE AROUND HERE ONE
SUMMER THE STRANGER OBSERVED
I KNOW IT SAID INJUN JOE AND THIS LOOKS LIKE IT I SHOULD SAY
NOW YOU WON'T NEED TO DO THAT JOB
THE HALFBREED FROWNED
SAID HE
YOU DON'T KNOW ME
LEAST YOU DON'T KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT THING
'TAIN'T
ROBBERY ALTOGETHER IT'S REVENGE AND A WICKED LIGHT FLAMED IN HIS
EYES
I'LL NEED YOUR HELP IN IT
WHEN IT'S FINISHED THEN TEXAS
GO HOME
TO YOUR NANCE AND YOUR KIDS AND STAND BY TILL YOU HEAR FROM ME
WELL IF YOU SAY SO WHAT'LL WE DO WITH THIS BURY IT AGAIN
YES
RAVISHING DELIGHT OVERHEAD NO BY THE GREAT SACHEM NO
PROFOUND DISTRESS OVERHEAD I'D NEARLY FORGOT
THAT PICK HAD FRESH
EARTH ON IT THE BOYS WERE SICK WITH TERROR IN A MOMENT WHAT BUSINESS
HAS A PICK AND A SHOVEL HERE WHAT BUSINESS WITH FRESH EARTH ON
THEM WHO BROUGHT THEM HERE AND WHERE ARE THEY GONE HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYBODY SEEN ANYBODY WHAT BURY IT AGAIN AND LEAVE THEM TO COME AND
SEE THE GROUND DISTURBED NOT EXACTLY NOT EXACTLY
WE'LL TAKE IT TO MY
DEN
WHY OF COURSE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE
YOU MEAN NUMBER
ONE
NO NUMBER TWO UNDER THE CROSS
THE OTHER PLACE IS BAD TOO COMMON
ALL RIGHT
IT'S NEARLY DARK ENOUGH TO START
INJUN JOE GOT UP AND WENT ABOUT FROM WINDOW TO WINDOW CAUTIOUSLY PEEPING
OUT
PRESENTLY HE SAID
WHO COULD HAVE BROUGHT THOSE TOOLS HERE DO YOU RECKON THEY CAN BE
UPSTAIRS
THE BOYS' BREATH FORSOOK THEM
INJUN JOE PUT HIS HAND ON HIS KNIFE
HALTED A MOMENT UNDECIDED AND THEN TURNED TOWARD THE STAIRWAY
THE
BOYS THOUGHT OF THE CLOSET BUT THEIR STRENGTH WAS GONE
THE STEPS CAME
CREAKING UP THE STAIRS THE INTOLERABLE DISTRESS OF THE SITUATION WOKE
THE STRICKEN RESOLUTION OF THE LADS THEY WERE ABOUT TO SPRING FOR THE
CLOSET WHEN THERE WAS A CRASH OF ROTTEN TIMBERS AND INJUN JOE LANDED ON
THE GROUND AMID THE DEBRIS OF THE RUINED STAIRWAY
HE GATHERED HIMSELF
UP CURSING AND HIS COMRADE SAID
NOW WHAT'S THE USE OF ALL THAT IF IT'S ANYBODY AND THEY'RE UP THERE
LET THEM STAY THERE WHO CARES IF THEY WANT TO JUMP DOWN NOW AND GET
INTO TROUBLE WHO OBJECTS IT WILL BE DARK IN FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THEN
LET THEM FOLLOW US IF THEY WANT TO
I'M WILLING
IN MY OPINION WHOEVER
HOVE THOSE THINGS IN HERE CAUGHT A SIGHT OF US AND TOOK US FOR GHOSTS OR
DEVILS OR SOMETHING
I'LL BET THEY'RE RUNNING YET
JOE GRUMBLED AWHILE THEN HE AGREED WITH HIS FRIEND THAT WHAT DAYLIGHT
WAS LEFT OUGHT TO BE ECONOMIZED IN GETTING THINGS READY FOR LEAVING
SHORTLY AFTERWARD THEY SLIPPED OUT OF THE HOUSE IN THE DEEPENING
TWILIGHT AND MOVED TOWARD THE RIVER WITH THEIR PRECIOUS BOX
TOM AND HUCK ROSE UP WEAK BUT VASTLY RELIEVED AND STARED AFTER THEM
THROUGH THE CHINKS BETWEEN THE LOGS OF THE HOUSE
FOLLOW NOT THEY
THEY
WERE CONTENT TO REACH GROUND AGAIN WITHOUT BROKEN NECKS AND TAKE THE
TOWNWARD TRACK OVER THE HILL
THEY DID NOT TALK MUCH
THEY WERE TOO MUCH
ABSORBED IN HATING THEMSELVES HATING THE ILL LUCK THAT MADE THEM TAKE
THE SPADE AND THE PICK THERE
BUT FOR THAT INJUN JOE NEVER WOULD HAVE
SUSPECTED
HE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN THE SILVER WITH THE GOLD TO WAIT
THERE TILL HIS REVENGE WAS SATISFIED AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE
MISFORTUNE TO FIND THAT MONEY TURN UP MISSING
BITTER BITTER LUCK THAT
THE TOOLS WERE EVER BROUGHT THERE
THEY RESOLVED TO KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR THAT SPANIARD WHEN HE SHOULD COME TO
TOWN SPYING OUT FOR CHANCES TO DO HIS REVENGEFUL JOB AND FOLLOW HIM TO
NUMBER TWO WHEREVER THAT MIGHT BE
THEN A GHASTLY THOUGHT OCCURRED TO
TOM
REVENGE WHAT IF HE MEANS US HUCK
OH DON'T SAID HUCK NEARLY FAINTING
THEY TALKED IT ALL OVER AND AS THEY ENTERED TOWN THEY AGREED TO BELIEVE
THAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY MEAN SOMEBODY ELSE AT LEAST THAT HE MIGHT AT
LEAST MEAN NOBODY BUT TOM SINCE ONLY TOM HAD TESTIFIED
VERY VERY SMALL COMFORT IT WAS TO TOM TO BE ALONE IN DANGER COMPANY
WOULD BE A PALPABLE IMPROVEMENT HE THOUGHT
CHAPTER XXVII
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DAY MIGHTILY TORMENTED TOM'S DREAMS THAT NIGHT
FOUR TIMES HE HAD HIS HANDS ON THAT RICH TREASURE AND FOUR TIMES
IT WASTED TO NOTHINGNESS IN HIS FINGERS AS SLEEP FORSOOK HIM AND
WAKEFULNESS BROUGHT BACK THE HARD REALITY OF HIS MISFORTUNE
AS HE LAY
IN THE EARLY MORNING RECALLING THE INCIDENTS OF HIS GREAT ADVENTURE HE
NOTICED THAT THEY SEEMED CURIOUSLY SUBDUED AND FAR AWAY SOMEWHAT AS IF
THEY HAD HAPPENED IN ANOTHER WORLD OR IN A TIME LONG GONE BY
THEN IT
OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE GREAT ADVENTURE ITSELF MUST BE A DREAM THERE
WAS ONE VERY STRONG ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THIS IDEA NAMELY THAT THE
QUANTITY OF COIN HE HAD SEEN WAS TOO VAST TO BE REAL
HE HAD NEVER SEEN
AS MUCH AS FIFTY DOLLARS IN ONE MASS BEFORE AND HE WAS LIKE ALL BOYS OF
HIS AGE AND STATION IN LIFE IN THAT HE IMAGINED THAT ALL REFERENCES TO
HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS WERE MERE FANCIFUL FORMS OF SPEECH AND THAT
NO SUCH SUMS REALLY EXISTED IN THE WORLD
HE NEVER HAD SUPPOSED FOR
A MOMENT THAT SO LARGE A SUM AS A HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS TO BE FOUND IN
ACTUAL MONEY IN ANY ONE'S POSSESSION
IF HIS NOTIONS OF HIDDEN TREASURE
HAD BEEN ANALYZED THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CONSIST OF A HANDFUL OF
REAL DIMES AND A BUSHEL OF VAGUE SPLENDID UNGRASPABLE DOLLARS
BUT THE INCIDENTS OF HIS ADVENTURE GREW SENSIBLY SHARPER AND CLEARER
UNDER THE ATTRITION OF THINKING THEM OVER AND SO HE PRESENTLY FOUND
HIMSELF LEANING TO THE IMPRESSION THAT THE THING MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN A
DREAM AFTER ALL
THIS UNCERTAINTY MUST BE SWEPT AWAY
HE WOULD SNATCH A
HURRIED BREAKFAST AND GO AND FIND HUCK
HUCK WAS SITTING ON THE GUNWALE
OF A FLATBOAT LISTLESSLY DANGLING HIS FEET IN THE WATER AND LOOKING
VERY MELANCHOLY
TOM CONCLUDED TO LET HUCK LEAD UP TO THE SUBJECT
IF
HE DID NOT DO IT THEN THE ADVENTURE WOULD BE PROVED TO HAVE BEEN ONLY A
DREAM
HELLO HUCK
HELLO YOURSELF
SILENCE FOR A MINUTE
TOM IF WE'D 'A' LEFT THE BLAME TOOLS AT THE DEAD TREE WE'D 'A' GOT
THE MONEY
OH AIN'T IT AWFUL
'TAIN'T A DREAM THEN 'TAIN'T A DREAM SOMEHOW I MOST WISH IT WAS
DOG'D IF I DON'T HUCK
WHAT AIN'T A DREAM
OH THAT THING YESTERDAY
I BEEN HALF THINKING IT WAS
DREAM IF THEM STAIRS HADN'T BROKE DOWN YOU'D 'A' SEEN HOW MUCH DREAM
IT WAS I'VE HAD DREAMS ENOUGH ALL NIGHT WITH THAT PATCH EYED SPANISH
DEVIL GOING FOR ME ALL THROUGH 'EM ROT HIM
NO NOT ROT HIM
FIND HIM TRACK THE MONEY
TOM WE'LL NEVER FIND HIM
A FELLER DON'T HAVE ONLY ONE CHANCE FOR SUCH
A PILE AND THAT ONE'S LOST
I'D FEEL MIGHTY SHAKY IF I WAS TO SEE HIM
ANYWAY
WELL SO'D I BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM ANYWAY AND TRACK HIM OUT TO HIS
NUMBER TWO
NUMBER TWO YES THAT'S IT
I BEEN THINKING 'BOUT THAT
BUT I CAN'T MAKE
NOTHING OUT OF IT
WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT IS
I DONO
IT'S TOO DEEP
SAY HUCK MAYBE IT'S THE NUMBER OF A HOUSE
GOODY
NO TOM THAT AIN'T IT
IF IT IS IT AIN'T IN THIS ONE HORSE
TOWN
THEY AIN'T NO NUMBERS HERE
WELL THAT'S SO
LEMME THINK A MINUTE
HERE IT'S THE NUMBER OF A
ROOM IN A TAVERN YOU KNOW
OH THAT'S THE TRICK THEY AIN'T ONLY TWO TAVERNS
WE CAN FIND OUT
QUICK
YOU STAY HERE HUCK TILL I COME
TOM WAS OFF AT ONCE
HE DID NOT CARE TO HAVE HUCK'S COMPANY IN PUBLIC
PLACES
HE WAS GONE HALF AN HOUR
HE FOUND THAT IN THE BEST TAVERN NO
2 HAD LONG BEEN OCCUPIED BY A YOUNG LAWYER AND WAS STILL SO OCCUPIED
IN THE LESS OSTENTATIOUS HOUSE NO
2 WAS A MYSTERY
THE TAVERN KEEPER'S
YOUNG SON SAID IT WAS KEPT LOCKED ALL THE TIME AND HE NEVER SAW ANYBODY
GO INTO IT OR COME OUT OF IT EXCEPT AT NIGHT HE DID NOT KNOW ANY
PARTICULAR REASON FOR THIS STATE OF THINGS HAD HAD SOME LITTLE
CURIOSITY BUT IT WAS RATHER FEEBLE HAD MADE THE MOST OF THE MYSTERY
BY ENTERTAINING HIMSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT THAT ROOM WAS HA'NTED HAD
NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE
THAT'S WHAT I'VE FOUND OUT HUCK
I RECKON THAT'S THE VERY NO
2 WE'RE
AFTER
I RECKON IT IS TOM
NOW WHAT YOU GOING TO DO
LEMME THINK
TOM THOUGHT A LONG TIME
THEN HE SAID
I'LL TELL YOU
THE BACK DOOR OF THAT NO
2 IS THE DOOR THAT COMES OUT
INTO THAT LITTLE CLOSE ALLEY BETWEEN THE TAVERN AND THE OLD RATTLE TRAP
OF A BRICK STORE
NOW YOU GET HOLD OF ALL THE DOORKEYS YOU CAN FIND AND
I'LL NIP ALL OF AUNTIE'S AND THE FIRST DARK NIGHT WE'LL GO THERE AND
TRY 'EM
AND MIND YOU KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR INJUN JOE BECAUSE HE SAID HE
WAS GOING TO DROP INTO TOWN AND SPY AROUND ONCE MORE FOR A CHANCE TO GET
HIS REVENGE
IF YOU SEE HIM YOU JUST FOLLOW HIM AND IF HE DON'T GO TO
THAT NO
2 THAT AIN'T THE PLACE
LORDY I DON'T WANT TO FOLLER HIM BY MYSELF
WHY IT'LL BE NIGHT SURE
HE MIGHTN'T EVER SEE YOU AND IF HE DID
MAYBE HE'D NEVER THINK ANYTHING
WELL IF IT'S PRETTY DARK I RECKON I'LL TRACK HIM
I DONO I DONO
I'LL
TRY
YOU BET I'LL FOLLOW HIM IF IT'S DARK HUCK
WHY HE MIGHT 'A' FOUND
OUT HE COULDN'T GET HIS REVENGE AND BE GOING RIGHT AFTER THAT MONEY
IT'S SO TOM IT'S SO
I'LL FOLLER HIM I WILL BY JINGOES
NOW YOU'RE TALKING DON'T YOU EVER WEAKEN HUCK AND I WON'T
CHAPTER XXVIII
THAT NIGHT TOM AND HUCK WERE READY FOR THEIR ADVENTURE
THEY HUNG ABOUT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE TAVERN UNTIL AFTER NINE ONE WATCHING THE ALLEY
AT A DISTANCE AND THE OTHER THE TAVERN DOOR
NOBODY ENTERED THE ALLEY OR
LEFT IT NOBODY RESEMBLING THE SPANIARD ENTERED OR LEFT THE TAVERN
DOOR
THE NIGHT PROMISED TO BE A FAIR ONE SO TOM WENT HOME WITH THE
UNDERSTANDING THAT IF A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DARKNESS CAME ON HUCK
WAS TO COME AND MAOW WHEREUPON HE WOULD SLIP OUT AND TRY THE KEYS
BUT THE NIGHT REMAINED CLEAR AND HUCK CLOSED HIS WATCH AND RETIRED TO
BED IN AN EMPTY SUGAR HOGSHEAD ABOUT TWELVE
TUESDAY THE BOYS HAD THE SAME ILL LUCK
ALSO WEDNESDAY
BUT THURSDAY
NIGHT PROMISED BETTER
TOM SLIPPED OUT IN GOOD SEASON WITH HIS AUNT'S
OLD TIN LANTERN AND A LARGE TOWEL TO BLINDFOLD IT WITH
HE HID THE
LANTERN IN HUCK'S SUGAR HOGSHEAD AND THE WATCH BEGAN
AN HOUR BEFORE
MIDNIGHT THE TAVERN CLOSED UP AND ITS LIGHTS THE ONLY ONES THEREABOUTS
WERE PUT OUT
NO SPANIARD HAD BEEN SEEN
NOBODY HAD ENTERED OR LEFT THE
ALLEY
EVERYTHING WAS AUSPICIOUS
THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS REIGNED
THE PERFECT STILLNESS WAS INTERRUPTED ONLY BY OCCASIONAL MUTTERINGS OF
DISTANT THUNDER
TOM GOT HIS LANTERN LIT IT IN THE HOGSHEAD WRAPPED IT CLOSELY IN THE
TOWEL AND THE TWO ADVENTURERS CREPT IN THE GLOOM TOWARD THE TAVERN
HUCK STOOD SENTRY AND TOM FELT HIS WAY INTO THE ALLEY
THEN THERE WAS
A SEASON OF WAITING ANXIETY THAT WEIGHED UPON HUCK'S SPIRITS LIKE A
MOUNTAIN
HE BEGAN TO WISH HE COULD SEE A FLASH FROM THE LANTERN IT
WOULD FRIGHTEN HIM BUT IT WOULD AT LEAST TELL HIM THAT TOM WAS ALIVE
YET
IT SEEMED HOURS SINCE TOM HAD DISAPPEARED
SURELY HE MUST HAVE
FAINTED MAYBE HE WAS DEAD MAYBE HIS HEART HAD BURST UNDER TERROR AND
EXCITEMENT
IN HIS UNEASINESS HUCK FOUND HIMSELF DRAWING CLOSER
AND CLOSER TO THE ALLEY FEARING ALL SORTS OF DREADFUL THINGS AND
MOMENTARILY EXPECTING SOME CATASTROPHE TO HAPPEN THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY
HIS BREATH
THERE WAS NOT MUCH TO TAKE AWAY FOR HE SEEMED ONLY ABLE TO
INHALE IT BY THIMBLEFULS AND HIS HEART WOULD SOON WEAR ITSELF OUT THE
WAY IT WAS BEATING
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A FLASH OF LIGHT AND TOM CAME
TEARING BY HIM RUN SAID HE RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
HE NEEDN'T HAVE REPEATED IT ONCE WAS ENOUGH HUCK WAS MAKING THIRTY OR
FORTY MILES AN HOUR BEFORE THE REPETITION WAS UTTERED
THE BOYS NEVER
STOPPED TILL THEY REACHED THE SHED OF A DESERTED SLAUGHTER HOUSE AT THE
LOWER END OF THE VILLAGE
JUST AS THEY GOT WITHIN ITS SHELTER THE STORM
BURST AND THE RAIN POURED DOWN
AS SOON AS TOM GOT HIS BREATH HE SAID
HUCK IT WAS AWFUL I TRIED TWO OF THE KEYS JUST AS SOFT AS I COULD
BUT THEY SEEMED TO MAKE SUCH A POWER OF RACKET THAT I COULDN'T HARDLY
GET MY BREATH I WAS SO SCARED
THEY WOULDN'T TURN IN THE LOCK EITHER
WELL WITHOUT NOTICING WHAT I WAS DOING I TOOK HOLD OF THE KNOB AND
OPEN COMES THE DOOR IT WARN'T LOCKED I HOPPED IN AND SHOOK OFF THE
TOWEL AND GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST
WHAT WHAT'D YOU SEE TOM
HUCK I MOST STEPPED ONTO INJUN JOE'S HAND
NO
YES HE WAS LYING THERE SOUND ASLEEP ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS OLD PATCH
ON HIS EYE AND HIS ARMS SPREAD OUT
LORDY WHAT DID YOU DO DID HE WAKE UP
NO NEVER BUDGED
DRUNK I RECKON
I JUST GRABBED THAT TOWEL AND
STARTED
I'D NEVER 'A' THOUGHT OF THE TOWEL I BET
WELL I WOULD
MY AUNT WOULD MAKE ME MIGHTY SICK IF I LOST IT
SAY TOM DID YOU SEE THAT BOX
HUCK I DIDN'T WAIT TO LOOK AROUND
I DIDN'T SEE THE BOX I DIDN'T SEE
THE CROSS
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT A BOTTLE AND A TIN CUP ON THE FLOOR
BY INJUN JOE YES I SAW TWO BARRELS AND LOTS MORE BOTTLES IN THE ROOM
DON'T YOU SEE NOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THAT HA'NTED ROOM
HOW
WHY IT'S HA'NTED WITH WHISKEY MAYBE ALL THE TEMPERANCE TAVERNS HAVE
GOT A HA'NTED ROOM HEY HUCK
WELL I RECKON MAYBE THAT'S SO
WHO'D 'A' THOUGHT SUCH A THING BUT
SAY TOM NOW'S A MIGHTY GOOD TIME TO GET THAT BOX IF INJUN JOE'S
DRUNK
IT IS THAT YOU TRY IT
HUCK SHUDDERED
WELL NO I RECKON NOT
AND I RECKON NOT HUCK
ONLY ONE BOTTLE ALONGSIDE OF INJUN JOE AIN'T
ENOUGH
IF THERE'D BEEN THREE HE'D BE DRUNK ENOUGH AND I'D DO IT
THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE FOR REFLECTION AND THEN TOM SAID
LOOKYHERE HUCK LESS NOT TRY THAT THING ANY MORE TILL WE KNOW INJUN
JOE'S NOT IN THERE
IT'S TOO SCARY
NOW IF WE WATCH EVERY NIGHT WE'LL
BE DEAD SURE TO SEE HIM GO OUT SOME TIME OR OTHER AND THEN WE'LL
SNATCH THAT BOX QUICKER'N LIGHTNING
WELL I'M AGREED
I'LL WATCH THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG AND I'LL DO IT EVERY
NIGHT TOO IF YOU'LL DO THE OTHER PART OF THE JOB
ALL RIGHT I WILL
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS TO TROT UP HOOPER STREET A
BLOCK AND MAOW AND IF I'M ASLEEP YOU THROW SOME GRAVEL AT THE WINDOW
AND THAT'LL FETCH ME
AGREED AND GOOD AS WHEAT
NOW HUCK THE STORM'S OVER AND I'LL GO HOME
IT'LL BEGIN TO BE
DAYLIGHT IN A COUPLE OF HOURS

HE LIKES ME BECUZ I DON'T EVER ACT AS
IF I WAS ABOVE HIM
SOMETIME I'VE SET RIGHT DOWN AND EAT WITH HIM
BUT

WELL IF I DON'T WANT YOU IN THE DAYTIME I'LL LET YOU SLEEP
I WON'T
COME BOTHERING AROUND
ANY TIME YOU SEE SOMETHING'S UP IN THE NIGHT
JUST SKIP RIGHT AROUND AND MAOW
CHAPTER XXIX
THE FIRST THING TOM HEARD ON FRIDAY MORNING WAS A GLAD PIECE OF
NEWS JUDGE THATCHER'S FAMILY HAD COME BACK TO TOWN THE NIGHT BEFORE
BOTH INJUN JOE AND THE TREASURE SUNK INTO SECONDARY IMPORTANCE FOR A
MOMENT AND BECKY TOOK THE CHIEF PLACE IN THE BOY'S INTEREST
HE SAW HER
AND THEY HAD AN EXHAUSTING GOOD TIME PLAYING HISPY AND GULLY KEEPER
WITH A CROWD OF THEIR SCHOOLMATES
THE DAY WAS COMPLETED AND CROWNED IN
A PECULIARLY SATISFACTORY WAY BECKY TEASED HER MOTHER TO APPOINT
THE NEXT DAY FOR THE LONG PROMISED AND LONG DELAYED PICNIC AND SHE
CONSENTED
THE CHILD'S DELIGHT WAS BOUNDLESS AND TOM'S NOT MORE
MODERATE
THE INVITATIONS WERE SENT OUT BEFORE SUNSET AND STRAIGHTWAY
THE YOUNG FOLKS OF THE VILLAGE WERE THROWN INTO A FEVER OF PREPARATION
AND PLEASURABLE ANTICIPATION
TOM'S EXCITEMENT ENABLED HIM TO KEEP
AWAKE UNTIL A PRETTY LATE HOUR AND HE HAD GOOD HOPES OF HEARING HUCK'S
MAOW AND OF HAVING HIS TREASURE TO ASTONISH BECKY AND THE PICNICKERS
WITH NEXT DAY BUT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED
NO SIGNAL CAME THAT NIGHT
MORNING CAME EVENTUALLY AND BY TEN OR ELEVEN O'CLOCK A GIDDY AND
ROLLICKING COMPANY WERE GATHERED AT JUDGE THATCHER'S AND EVERYTHING WAS
READY FOR A START
IT WAS NOT THE CUSTOM FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE TO MAR THE
PICNICS WITH THEIR PRESENCE
THE CHILDREN WERE CONSIDERED SAFE ENOUGH
UNDER THE WINGS OF A FEW YOUNG LADIES OF EIGHTEEN AND A FEW YOUNG
GENTLEMEN OF TWENTY THREE OR THEREABOUTS
THE OLD STEAM FERRY BOAT WAS
CHARTERED FOR THE OCCASION PRESENTLY THE GAY THRONG FILED UP THE MAIN
STREET LADEN WITH PROVISION BASKETS
SID WAS SICK AND HAD TO MISS
THE FUN MARY REMAINED AT HOME TO ENTERTAIN HIM
THE LAST THING MRS
THATCHER SAID TO BECKY WAS
YOU'LL NOT GET BACK TILL LATE
PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER STAY ALL NIGHT WITH
SOME OF THE GIRLS THAT LIVE NEAR THE FERRY LANDING CHILD
THEN I'LL STAY WITH SUSY HARPER MAMMA
VERY WELL
AND MIND AND BEHAVE YOURSELF AND DON'T BE ANY TROUBLE
PRESENTLY AS THEY TRIPPED ALONG TOM SAID TO BECKY
SAY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO
'STEAD OF GOING TO JOE HARPER'S WE'LL
CLIMB RIGHT UP THE HILL AND STOP AT THE WIDOW DOUGLAS'
SHE'LL HAVE
ICE CREAM SHE HAS IT MOST EVERY DAY DEAD LOADS OF IT
AND SHE'LL BE
AWFUL GLAD TO HAVE US
OH THAT WILL BE FUN
THEN BECKY REFLECTED A MOMENT AND SAID
BUT WHAT WILL MAMMA SAY
HOW'LL SHE EVER KNOW
THE GIRL TURNED THE IDEA OVER IN HER MIND AND SAID RELUCTANTLY
I RECKON IT'S WRONG BUT
BUT SHUCKS YOUR MOTHER WON'T KNOW AND SO WHAT'S THE HARM ALL SHE
WANTS IS THAT YOU'LL BE SAFE AND I BET YOU SHE'D 'A' SAID GO THERE IF
SHE'D 'A' THOUGHT OF IT
I KNOW SHE WOULD
THE WIDOW DOUGLAS' SPLENDID HOSPITALITY WAS A TEMPTING BAIT
IT AND
TOM'S PERSUASIONS PRESENTLY CARRIED THE DAY
SO IT WAS DECIDED TO SAY
NOTHING TO ANYBODY ABOUT THE NIGHT'S PROGRAMME
PRESENTLY IT OCCURRED TO
TOM THAT MAYBE HUCK MIGHT COME THIS VERY NIGHT AND GIVE THE SIGNAL
THE
THOUGHT TOOK A DEAL OF THE SPIRIT OUT OF HIS ANTICIPATIONS
STILL HE
COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE UP THE FUN AT WIDOW DOUGLAS'
AND WHY SHOULD HE
GIVE IT UP HE REASONED THE SIGNAL DID NOT COME THE NIGHT BEFORE SO
WHY SHOULD IT BE ANY MORE LIKELY TO COME TONIGHT THE SURE FUN OF THE
EVENING OUTWEIGHED THE UNCERTAIN TREASURE AND BOY LIKE HE DETERMINED
TO YIELD TO THE STRONGER INCLINATION AND NOT ALLOW HIMSELF TO THINK OF
THE BOX OF MONEY ANOTHER TIME THAT DAY
THREE MILES BELOW TOWN THE FERRYBOAT STOPPED AT THE MOUTH OF A WOODY
HOLLOW AND TIED UP
THE CROWD SWARMED ASHORE AND SOON THE FOREST
DISTANCES AND CRAGGY HEIGHTS ECHOED FAR AND NEAR WITH SHOUTINGS AND
LAUGHTER
ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS OF GETTING HOT AND TIRED WERE GONE
THROUGH WITH AND BY AND BY THE ROVERS STRAGGLED BACK TO CAMP FORTIFIED
WITH RESPONSIBLE APPETITES AND THEN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GOOD THINGS
BEGAN
AFTER THE FEAST THERE WAS A REFRESHING SEASON OF REST AND CHAT IN
THE SHADE OF SPREADING OAKS
BY AND BY SOMEBODY SHOUTED
WHO'S READY FOR THE CAVE
EVERYBODY WAS
BUNDLES OF CANDLES WERE PROCURED AND STRAIGHTWAY THERE
WAS A GENERAL SCAMPER UP THE HILL
THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE WAS UP THE
HILLSIDE AN OPENING SHAPED LIKE A LETTER A
ITS MASSIVE OAKEN DOOR STOOD
UNBARRED
WITHIN WAS A SMALL CHAMBER CHILLY AS AN ICEHOUSE AND WALLED
BY NATURE WITH SOLID LIMESTONE THAT WAS DEWY WITH A COLD SWEAT
IT WAS
ROMANTIC AND MYSTERIOUS TO STAND HERE IN THE DEEP GLOOM AND LOOK OUT
UPON THE GREEN VALLEY SHINING IN THE SUN
BUT THE IMPRESSIVENESS OF THE
SITUATION QUICKLY WORE OFF AND THE ROMPING BEGAN AGAIN
THE MOMENT
A CANDLE WAS LIGHTED THERE WAS A GENERAL RUSH UPON THE OWNER OF IT A
STRUGGLE AND A GALLANT DEFENCE FOLLOWED BUT THE CANDLE WAS SOON KNOCKED
DOWN OR BLOWN OUT AND THEN THERE WAS A GLAD CLAMOR OF LAUGHTER AND A
NEW CHASE
BUT ALL THINGS HAVE AN END
BY AND BY THE PROCESSION WENT
FILING DOWN THE STEEP DESCENT OF THE MAIN AVENUE THE FLICKERING RANK OF
LIGHTS DIMLY REVEALING THE LOFTY WALLS OF ROCK ALMOST TO THEIR POINT OF
JUNCTION SIXTY FEET OVERHEAD
THIS MAIN AVENUE WAS NOT MORE THAN
EIGHT OR TEN FEET WIDE
EVERY FEW STEPS OTHER LOFTY AND STILL NARROWER
CREVICES BRANCHED FROM IT ON EITHER HAND FOR MCDOUGAL'S CAVE WAS BUT A
VAST LABYRINTH OF CROOKED AISLES THAT RAN INTO EACH OTHER AND OUT AGAIN
AND LED NOWHERE
IT WAS SAID THAT ONE MIGHT WANDER DAYS AND NIGHTS
TOGETHER THROUGH ITS INTRICATE TANGLE OF RIFTS AND CHASMS AND NEVER
FIND THE END OF THE CAVE AND THAT HE MIGHT GO DOWN AND DOWN AND
STILL DOWN INTO THE EARTH AND IT WAS JUST THE SAME LABYRINTH UNDER
LABYRINTH AND NO END TO ANY OF THEM
NO MAN KNEW THE CAVE
THAT WAS
AN IMPOSSIBLE THING
MOST OF THE YOUNG MEN KNEW A PORTION OF IT AND IT
WAS NOT CUSTOMARY TO VENTURE MUCH BEYOND THIS KNOWN PORTION
TOM SAWYER
KNEW AS MUCH OF THE CAVE AS ANY ONE
THE PROCESSION MOVED ALONG THE MAIN AVENUE SOME THREE QUARTERS OF
A MILE AND THEN GROUPS AND COUPLES BEGAN TO SLIP ASIDE INTO BRANCH
AVENUES FLY ALONG THE DISMAL CORRIDORS AND TAKE EACH OTHER BY SURPRISE
AT POINTS WHERE THE CORRIDORS JOINED AGAIN
PARTIES WERE ABLE TO ELUDE
EACH OTHER FOR THE SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR WITHOUT GOING BEYOND THE
KNOWN GROUND
BY AND BY ONE GROUP AFTER ANOTHER CAME STRAGGLING BACK TO THE MOUTH
OF THE CAVE PANTING HILARIOUS SMEARED FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH TALLOW
DRIPPINGS DAUBED WITH CLAY AND ENTIRELY DELIGHTED WITH THE SUCCESS OF
THE DAY
THEN THEY WERE ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT THEY HAD BEEN TAKING
NO NOTE OF TIME AND THAT NIGHT WAS ABOUT AT HAND
THE CLANGING BELL HAD
BEEN CALLING FOR HALF AN HOUR
HOWEVER THIS SORT OF CLOSE TO THE DAY'S
ADVENTURES WAS ROMANTIC AND THEREFORE SATISFACTORY
WHEN THE FERRYBOAT
WITH HER WILD FREIGHT PUSHED INTO THE STREAM NOBODY CARED SIXPENCE FOR
THE WASTED TIME BUT THE CAPTAIN OF THE CRAFT
HUCK WAS ALREADY UPON HIS WATCH WHEN THE FERRYBOAT'S LIGHTS WENT
GLINTING PAST THE WHARF
HE HEARD NO NOISE ON BOARD FOR THE YOUNG
PEOPLE WERE AS SUBDUED AND STILL AS PEOPLE USUALLY ARE WHO ARE NEARLY
TIRED TO DEATH
HE WONDERED WHAT BOAT IT WAS AND WHY SHE DID NOT
STOP AT THE WHARF AND THEN HE DROPPED HER OUT OF HIS MIND AND PUT HIS
ATTENTION UPON HIS BUSINESS
THE NIGHT WAS GROWING CLOUDY AND DARK
TEN
O'CLOCK CAME AND THE NOISE OF VEHICLES CEASED SCATTERED LIGHTS BEGAN
TO WINK OUT ALL STRAGGLING FOOT PASSENGERS DISAPPEARED THE VILLAGE
BETOOK ITSELF TO ITS SLUMBERS AND LEFT THE SMALL WATCHER ALONE WITH THE
SILENCE AND THE GHOSTS
ELEVEN O'CLOCK CAME AND THE TAVERN LIGHTS WERE
PUT OUT DARKNESS EVERYWHERE NOW
HUCK WAITED WHAT SEEMED A WEARY LONG
TIME BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
HIS FAITH WAS WEAKENING
WAS THERE ANY USE
WAS THERE REALLY ANY USE WHY NOT GIVE IT UP AND TURN IN
A NOISE FELL UPON HIS EAR
HE WAS ALL ATTENTION IN AN INSTANT
THE ALLEY
DOOR CLOSED SOFTLY
HE SPRANG TO THE CORNER OF THE BRICK STORE
THE NEXT
MOMENT TWO MEN BRUSHED BY HIM AND ONE SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING UNDER
HIS ARM
IT MUST BE THAT BOX SO THEY WERE GOING TO REMOVE THE TREASURE
WHY CALL TOM NOW IT WOULD BE ABSURD THE MEN WOULD GET AWAY WITH THE BOX
AND NEVER BE FOUND AGAIN
NO HE WOULD STICK TO THEIR WAKE AND FOLLOW
THEM HE WOULD TRUST TO THE DARKNESS FOR SECURITY FROM DISCOVERY
SO
COMMUNING WITH HIMSELF HUCK STEPPED OUT AND GLIDED ALONG BEHIND THE
MEN CAT LIKE WITH BARE FEET ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP JUST FAR ENOUGH
AHEAD NOT TO BE INVISIBLE
THEY MOVED UP THE RIVER STREET THREE BLOCKS THEN TURNED TO THE LEFT UP
A CROSSSTREET
THEY WENT STRAIGHT AHEAD THEN UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE
PATH THAT LED UP CARDIFF HILL THIS THEY TOOK
THEY PASSED BY THE OLD
WELSHMAN'S HOUSE HALFWAY UP THE HILL WITHOUT HESITATING AND STILL
CLIMBED UPWARD
GOOD THOUGHT HUCK THEY WILL BURY IT IN THE OLD QUARRY
BUT THEY NEVER STOPPED AT THE QUARRY
THEY PASSED ON UP THE SUMMIT
THEY PLUNGED INTO THE NARROW PATH BETWEEN THE TALL SUMACH BUSHES AND
WERE AT ONCE HIDDEN IN THE GLOOM
HUCK CLOSED UP AND SHORTENED HIS
DISTANCE NOW FOR THEY WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE HIM
HE TROTTED ALONG
AWHILE THEN SLACKENED HIS PACE FEARING HE WAS GAINING TOO FAST MOVED
ON A PIECE THEN STOPPED ALTOGETHER LISTENED NO SOUND NONE SAVE THAT
HE SEEMED TO HEAR THE BEATING OF HIS OWN HEART
THE HOOTING OF AN
OWL CAME OVER THE HILL OMINOUS SOUND BUT NO FOOTSTEPS
HEAVENS WAS
EVERYTHING LOST HE WAS ABOUT TO SPRING WITH WINGED FEET WHEN A MAN
CLEARED HIS THROAT NOT FOUR FEET FROM HIM HUCK'S HEART SHOT INTO HIS
THROAT BUT HE SWALLOWED IT AGAIN AND THEN HE STOOD THERE SHAKING AS
IF A DOZEN AGUES HAD TAKEN CHARGE OF HIM AT ONCE AND SO WEAK THAT HE
THOUGHT HE MUST SURELY FALL TO THE GROUND
HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS
HE
KNEW HE WAS WITHIN FIVE STEPS OF THE STILE LEADING INTO WIDOW DOUGLAS'
GROUNDS
VERY WELL HE THOUGHT LET THEM BURY IT THERE IT WON'T BE HARD
TO FIND
NOW THERE WAS A VOICE A VERY LOW VOICE INJUN JOE'S
DAMN HER MAYBE SHE'S GOT COMPANY THERE'S LIGHTS LATE AS IT IS
I CAN'T SEE ANY
THIS WAS THAT STRANGER'S VOICE THE STRANGER OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE
A
DEADLY CHILL WENT TO HUCK'S HEART THIS THEN WAS THE REVENGE JOB HIS
THOUGHT WAS TO FLY
THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE WIDOW DOUGLAS HAD BEEN
KIND TO HIM MORE THAN ONCE AND MAYBE THESE MEN WERE GOING TO MURDER
HER
HE WISHED HE DARED VENTURE TO WARN HER BUT HE KNEW HE DIDN'T
DARE THEY MIGHT COME AND CATCH HIM
HE THOUGHT ALL THIS AND MORE IN
THE MOMENT THAT ELAPSED BETWEEN THE STRANGER'S REMARK AND INJUN JOE'S

THE QUICKER THE
BETTER I'M ALL IN A SHIVER
DO IT NOW AND COMPANY THERE LOOK HERE I'LL GET SUSPICIOUS OF YOU
FIRST THING YOU KNOW
NO WE'LL WAIT TILL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT THERE'S NO
HURRY
HUCK FELT THAT A SILENCE WAS GOING TO ENSUE A THING STILL MORE AWFUL
THAN ANY AMOUNT OF MURDEROUS TALK SO HE HELD HIS BREATH AND STEPPED
GINGERLY BACK PLANTED HIS FOOT CAREFULLY AND FIRMLY AFTER BALANCING
ONE LEGGED IN A PRECARIOUS WAY AND ALMOST TOPPLING OVER FIRST ON ONE
SIDE AND THEN ON THE OTHER
HE TOOK ANOTHER STEP BACK WITH THE SAME
ELABORATION AND THE SAME RISKS THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND A TWIG
SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT HIS BREATH STOPPED AND HE LISTENED
THERE WAS NO
SOUND THE STILLNESS WAS PERFECT
HIS GRATITUDE WAS MEASURELESS
NOW HE
TURNED IN HIS TRACKS BETWEEN THE WALLS OF SUMACH BUSHES TURNED
HIMSELF AS CAREFULLY AS IF HE WERE A SHIP AND THEN STEPPED QUICKLY BUT
CAUTIOUSLY ALONG
WHEN HE EMERGED AT THE QUARRY HE FELT SECURE AND
SO HE PICKED UP HIS NIMBLE HEELS AND FLEW
DOWN DOWN HE SPED TILL HE
REACHED THE WELSHMAN'S
HE BANGED AT THE DOOR AND PRESENTLY THE HEADS
OF THE OLD MAN AND HIS TWO STALWART SONS WERE THRUST FROM WINDOWS
WHAT'S THE ROW THERE WHO'S BANGING WHAT DO YOU WANT
LET ME IN QUICK I'LL TELL EVERYTHING
WHY WHO ARE YOU
HUCKLEBERRY FINN QUICK LET ME IN
HUCKLEBERRY FINN INDEED IT AIN'T A NAME TO OPEN MANY DOORS I JUDGE
BUT LET HIM IN LADS AND LET'S SEE WHAT'S THE TROUBLE
PLEASE DON'T EVER TELL I TOLD YOU WERE HUCK'S FIRST WORDS WHEN HE GOT
IN
PLEASE DON'T I'D BE KILLED SURE BUT THE WIDOW'S BEEN GOOD FRIENDS
TO ME SOMETIMES AND I WANT TO TELL I WILL TELL IF YOU'LL PROMISE YOU
WON'T EVER SAY IT WAS ME
BY GEORGE HE HAS GOT SOMETHING TO TELL OR HE WOULDN'T ACT SO
EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN OUT WITH IT AND NOBODY HERE'LL EVER TELL LAD
THREE MINUTES LATER THE OLD MAN AND HIS SONS WELL ARMED WERE UP THE
HILL AND JUST ENTERING THE SUMACH PATH ON TIPTOE THEIR WEAPONS IN
THEIR HANDS
HUCK ACCOMPANIED THEM NO FURTHER
HE HID BEHIND A GREAT
BOWLDER AND FELL TO LISTENING
THERE WAS A LAGGING ANXIOUS SILENCE AND
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OF FIREARMS AND A CRY
HUCK WAITED FOR NO PARTICULARS
HE SPRANG AWAY AND SPED DOWN THE HILL AS
FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM
CHAPTER XXX
AS THE EARLIEST SUSPICION OF DAWN APPEARED ON SUNDAY MORNING HUCK CAME
GROPING UP THE HILL AND RAPPED GENTLY AT THE OLD WELSHMAN'S DOOR
THE
INMATES WERE ASLEEP BUT IT WAS A SLEEP THAT WAS SET ON A HAIR TRIGGER
ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXCITING EPISODE OF THE NIGHT
A CALL CAME FROM A
WINDOW
WHO'S THERE
HUCK'S SCARED VOICE ANSWERED IN A LOW TONE
PLEASE LET ME IN IT'S ONLY HUCK FINN
IT'S A NAME THAT CAN OPEN THIS DOOR NIGHT OR DAY LAD AND WELCOME
THESE WERE STRANGE WORDS TO THE VAGABOND BOY'S EARS AND THE PLEASANTEST
HE HAD EVER HEARD
HE COULD NOT RECOLLECT THAT THE CLOSING WORD HAD EVER
BEEN APPLIED IN HIS CASE BEFORE
THE DOOR WAS QUICKLY UNLOCKED AND HE
ENTERED
HUCK WAS GIVEN A SEAT AND THE OLD MAN AND HIS BRACE OF TALL
SONS SPEEDILY DRESSED THEMSELVES
NOW MY BOY I HOPE YOU'RE GOOD AND HUNGRY BECAUSE BREAKFAST WILL BE
READY AS SOON AS THE SUN'S UP AND WE'LL HAVE A PIPING HOT ONE TOO MAKE
YOURSELF EASY ABOUT THAT I AND THE BOYS HOPED YOU'D TURN UP AND STOP
HERE LAST NIGHT
I WAS AWFUL SCARED SAID HUCK AND I RUN
I TOOK OUT WHEN THE PISTOLS
WENT OFF AND I DIDN'T STOP FOR THREE MILE
I'VE COME NOW BECUZ I WANTED
TO KNOW ABOUT IT YOU KNOW AND I COME BEFORE DAYLIGHT BECUZ I DIDN'T
WANT TO RUN ACROSS THEM DEVILS EVEN IF THEY WAS DEAD
WELL POOR CHAP YOU DO LOOK AS IF YOU'D HAD A HARD NIGHT OF IT BUT
THERE'S A BED HERE FOR YOU WHEN YOU'VE HAD YOUR BREAKFAST
NO THEY
AIN'T DEAD LAD WE ARE SORRY ENOUGH FOR THAT
YOU SEE WE KNEW RIGHT
WHERE TO PUT OUR HANDS ON THEM BY YOUR DESCRIPTION SO WE CREPT ALONG
ON TIPTOE TILL WE GOT WITHIN FIFTEEN FEET OF THEM DARK AS A CELLAR THAT
SUMACH PATH WAS AND JUST THEN I FOUND I WAS GOING TO SNEEZE
IT WAS THE
MEANEST KIND OF LUCK I TRIED TO KEEP IT BACK BUT NO USE 'TWAS BOUND TO
COME AND IT DID COME I WAS IN THE LEAD WITH MY PISTOL RAISED AND WHEN
THE SNEEZE STARTED THOSE SCOUNDRELS A RUSTLING TO GET OUT OF THE PATH
I SUNG OUT 'FIRE BOYS AND BLAZED AWAY AT THE PLACE WHERE THE RUSTLING
WAS
SO DID THE BOYS
BUT THEY WERE OFF IN A JIFFY THOSE VILLAINS AND
WE AFTER THEM DOWN THROUGH THE WOODS
I JUDGE WE NEVER TOUCHED THEM
THEY FIRED A SHOT APIECE AS THEY STARTED BUT THEIR BULLETS WHIZZED BY
AND DIDN'T DO US ANY HARM
AS SOON AS WE LOST THE SOUND OF THEIR FEET
WE QUIT CHASING AND WENT DOWN AND STIRRED UP THE CONSTABLES
THEY GOT A
POSSE TOGETHER AND WENT OFF TO GUARD THE RIVER BANK AND AS SOON AS IT
IS LIGHT THE SHERIFF AND A GANG ARE GOING TO BEAT UP THE WOODS
MY BOYS
WILL BE WITH THEM PRESENTLY
I WISH WE HAD SOME SORT OF DESCRIPTION OF
THOSE RASCALS 'TWOULD HELP A GOOD DEAL
BUT YOU COULDN'T SEE WHAT THEY
WERE LIKE IN THE DARK LAD I SUPPOSE
OH YES I SAW THEM DOWNTOWN AND FOLLERED THEM
SPLENDID DESCRIBE THEM DESCRIBE THEM MY BOY
ONE'S THE OLD DEAF AND DUMB SPANIARD THAT'S BEN AROUND HERE ONCE OR
TWICE AND T'OTHER'S A MEAN LOOKING RAGGED
THAT'S ENOUGH LAD WE KNOW THE MEN HAPPENED ON THEM IN THE WOODS BACK
OF THE WIDOW'S ONE DAY AND THEY SLUNK AWAY
OFF WITH YOU BOYS AND
TELL THE SHERIFF GET YOUR BREAKFAST TOMORROW MORNING
THE WELSHMAN'S SONS DEPARTED AT ONCE
AS THEY WERE LEAVING THE ROOM HUCK
SPRANG UP AND EXCLAIMED
OH PLEASE DON'T TELL ANY BODY IT WAS ME THAT BLOWED ON THEM OH
PLEASE
ALL RIGHT IF YOU SAY IT HUCK BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE CREDIT OF WHAT
YOU DID
OH NO NO PLEASE DON'T TELL
WHEN THE YOUNG MEN WERE GONE THE OLD WELSHMAN SAID
THEY WON'T TELL AND I WON'T
BUT WHY DON'T YOU WANT IT KNOWN
HUCK WOULD NOT EXPLAIN FURTHER THAN TO SAY THAT HE ALREADY KNEW TOO
MUCH ABOUT ONE OF THOSE MEN AND WOULD NOT HAVE THE MAN KNOW THAT HE KNEW
ANYTHING AGAINST HIM FOR THE WHOLE WORLD HE WOULD BE KILLED FOR KNOWING
IT SURE
THE OLD MAN PROMISED SECRECY ONCE MORE AND SAID
HOW DID YOU COME TO FOLLOW THESE FELLOWS LAD WERE THEY LOOKING
SUSPICIOUS
HUCK WAS SILENT WHILE HE FRAMED A DULY CAUTIOUS REPLY
THEN HE SAID
WELL YOU SEE I'M A KIND OF A HARD LOT LEAST EVERYBODY SAYS SO AND
I DON'T SEE NOTHING AGIN IT AND SOMETIMES I CAN'T SLEEP MUCH ON ACCOUNT
OF THINKING ABOUT IT AND SORT OF TRYING TO STRIKE OUT A NEW WAY OF
DOING
THAT WAS THE WAY OF IT LAST NIGHT
I COULDN'T SLEEP AND SO I
COME ALONG UPSTREET 'BOUT MIDNIGHT A TURNING IT ALL OVER AND WHEN I
GOT TO THAT OLD SHACKLY BRICK STORE BY THE TEMPERANCE TAVERN I BACKED
UP AGIN THE WALL TO HAVE ANOTHER THINK
WELL JUST THEN ALONG COMES
THESE TWO CHAPS SLIPPING ALONG CLOSE BY ME WITH SOMETHING UNDER THEIR
ARM AND I RECKONED THEY'D STOLE IT
ONE WAS A SMOKING AND T'OTHER ONE
WANTED A LIGHT SO THEY STOPPED RIGHT BEFORE ME AND THE CIGARS LIT UP
THEIR FACES AND I SEE THAT THE BIG ONE WAS THE DEAF AND DUMB SPANIARD
BY HIS WHITE WHISKERS AND THE PATCH ON HIS EYE AND T'OTHER ONE WAS A
RUSTY RAGGED LOOKING DEVIL
COULD YOU SEE THE RAGS BY THE LIGHT OF THE CIGARS
THIS STAGGERED HUCK FOR A MOMENT
THEN HE SAID
WELL I DON'T KNOW BUT SOMEHOW IT SEEMS AS IF I DID
THEN THEY WENT ON AND YOU
FOLLERED 'EM YES
THAT WAS IT
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WAS UP THEY SNEAKED
ALONG SO
I DOGGED 'EM TO THE WIDDER'S STILE AND STOOD IN THE DARK AND
HEARD THE RAGGED ONE BEG FOR THE WIDDER AND THE SPANIARD SWEAR HE'D
SPILE HER LOOKS JUST AS I TOLD YOU AND YOUR TWO
WHAT THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN SAID ALL THAT
HUCK HAD MADE ANOTHER TERRIBLE MISTAKE HE WAS TRYING HIS BEST TO KEEP
THE OLD MAN FROM GETTING THE FAINTEST HINT OF WHO THE SPANIARD MIGHT BE
AND YET HIS TONGUE SEEMED DETERMINED TO GET HIM INTO TROUBLE IN SPITE OF
ALL HE COULD DO
HE MADE SEVERAL EFFORTS TO CREEP OUT OF HIS SCRAPE
BUT THE OLD MAN'S EYE WAS UPON HIM AND HE MADE BLUNDER AFTER BLUNDER
PRESENTLY THE WELSHMAN SAID
MY BOY DON'T BE AFRAID OF ME
I WOULDN'T HURT A HAIR OF YOUR HEAD FOR
ALL THE WORLD
NO I'D PROTECT YOU I'D PROTECT YOU
THIS SPANIARD IS
NOT DEAF AND DUMB YOU'VE LET THAT SLIP WITHOUT INTENDING IT YOU CAN'T
COVER THAT UP NOW
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SPANIARD THAT YOU WANT
TO KEEP DARK
NOW TRUST ME TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND TRUST ME I WON'T
BETRAY YOU
HUCK LOOKED INTO THE OLD MAN'S HONEST EYES A MOMENT THEN BENT OVER AND
WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
'TAIN'T A SPANIARD IT'S INJUN JOE
THE WELSHMAN ALMOST JUMPED OUT OF HIS CHAIR
IN A MOMENT HE SAID
IT'S ALL PLAIN ENOUGH NOW
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT NOTCHING EARS AND
SLITTING NOSES I JUDGED THAT THAT WAS YOUR OWN EMBELLISHMENT BECAUSE
WHITE MEN DON'T TAKE THAT SORT OF REVENGE
BUT AN INJUN THAT'S A
DIFFERENT MATTER ALTOGETHER
DURING BREAKFAST THE TALK WENT ON AND IN THE COURSE OF IT THE OLD MAN
SAID THAT THE LAST THING WHICH HE AND HIS SONS HAD DONE BEFORE GOING
TO BED WAS TO GET A LANTERN AND EXAMINE THE STILE AND ITS VICINITY FOR
MARKS OF BLOOD
THEY FOUND NONE BUT CAPTURED A BULKY BUNDLE OF
OF WHAT
IF THE WORDS HAD BEEN LIGHTNING THEY COULD NOT HAVE LEAPED WITH A MORE
STUNNING SUDDENNESS FROM HUCK'S BLANCHED LIPS
HIS EYES WERE STARING
WIDE NOW AND HIS BREATH SUSPENDED WAITING FOR THE ANSWER
THE WELSHMAN
STARTED STARED IN RETURN THREE SECONDS FIVE SECONDS TEN THEN REPLIED
OF BURGLAR'S TOOLS
WHY WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
HUCK SANK BACK PANTING GENTLY BUT DEEPLY UNUTTERABLY GRATEFUL
THE
WELSHMAN EYED HIM GRAVELY CURIOUSLY AND PRESENTLY SAID
YES BURGLAR'S TOOLS
THAT APPEARS TO RELIEVE YOU A GOOD DEAL
BUT WHAT
DID GIVE YOU THAT TURN WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING WE'D FOUND
HUCK WAS IN A CLOSE PLACE THE INQUIRING EYE WAS UPON HIM HE WOULD HAVE
GIVEN ANYTHING FOR MATERIAL FOR A PLAUSIBLE ANSWER NOTHING SUGGESTED
ITSELF THE INQUIRING EYE WAS BORING DEEPER AND DEEPER A SENSELESS
REPLY OFFERED THERE WAS NO TIME TO WEIGH IT SO AT A VENTURE HE UTTERED
IT FEEBLY
SUNDAY SCHOOL BOOKS MAYBE
POOR HUCK WAS TOO DISTRESSED TO SMILE BUT THE OLD MAN LAUGHED LOUD AND
JOYOUSLY SHOOK UP THE DETAILS OF HIS ANATOMY FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND
ENDED BY SAYING THAT SUCH A LAUGH WAS MONEY IN A MAN'S POCKET BECAUSE
IT CUT DOWN THE DOCTOR'S BILL LIKE EVERYTHING
THEN HE ADDED
POOR OLD CHAP YOU'RE WHITE AND JADED YOU AIN'T WELL A BIT NO WONDER
YOU'RE A LITTLE FLIGHTY AND OFF YOUR BALANCE
BUT YOU'LL COME OUT OF IT
REST AND SLEEP WILL FETCH YOU OUT ALL RIGHT I HOPE
HUCK WAS IRRITATED TO THINK HE HAD BEEN SUCH A GOOSE AND BETRAYED SUCH
A SUSPICIOUS EXCITEMENT FOR HE HAD DROPPED THE IDEA THAT THE PARCEL
BROUGHT FROM THE TAVERN WAS THE TREASURE AS SOON AS HE HAD HEARD THE
TALK AT THE WIDOW'S STILE
HE HAD ONLY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT THE TREASURE
HOWEVER HE HAD NOT KNOWN THAT IT WASN'T AND SO THE SUGGESTION OF A
CAPTURED BUNDLE WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIS SELF POSSESSION
BUT ON THE WHOLE
HE FELT GLAD THE LITTLE EPISODE HAD HAPPENED FOR NOW HE KNEW BEYOND ALL
QUESTION THAT THAT BUNDLE WAS NOT THE BUNDLE AND SO HIS MIND WAS
AT REST AND EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE
IN FACT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE
DRIFTING JUST IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION NOW THE TREASURE MUST BE STILL
IN NO
2 THE MEN WOULD BE CAPTURED AND JAILED THAT DAY AND HE AND
TOM COULD SEIZE THE GOLD THAT NIGHT WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE OR ANY FEAR OF
INTERRUPTION
JUST AS BREAKFAST WAS COMPLETED THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
HUCK
JUMPED FOR A HIDING PLACE FOR HE HAD NO MIND TO BE CONNECTED EVEN
REMOTELY WITH THE LATE EVENT
THE WELSHMAN ADMITTED SEVERAL LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN AMONG THEM THE WIDOW DOUGLAS AND NOTICED THAT GROUPS OF
CITIZENS WERE CLIMBING UP THE HILL TO STARE AT THE STILE
SO THE NEWS
HAD SPREAD
THE WELSHMAN HAD TO TELL THE STORY OF THE NIGHT TO THE
VISITORS
THE WIDOW'S GRATITUDE FOR HER PRESERVATION WAS OUTSPOKEN
DON'T SAY A WORD ABOUT IT MADAM
THERE'S ANOTHER THAT YOU'RE MORE
BEHOLDEN TO THAN YOU ARE TO ME AND MY BOYS MAYBE BUT HE DON'T ALLOW ME
TO TELL HIS NAME
WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE BUT FOR HIM
OF COURSE THIS EXCITED A CURIOSITY SO VAST THAT IT ALMOST BELITTLED THE
MAIN MATTER BUT THE WELSHMAN ALLOWED IT TO EAT INTO THE VITALS OF HIS
VISITORS AND THROUGH THEM BE TRANSMITTED TO THE WHOLE TOWN FOR HE
REFUSED TO PART WITH HIS SECRET
WHEN ALL ELSE HAD BEEN LEARNED THE
WIDOW SAID
I WENT TO SLEEP READING IN BED AND SLEPT STRAIGHT THROUGH ALL THAT
NOISE
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME AND WAKE ME
WE JUDGED IT WARN'T WORTH WHILE
THOSE FELLOWS WARN'T LIKELY TO COME
AGAIN THEY HADN'T ANY TOOLS LEFT TO WORK WITH AND WHAT WAS THE USE OF
WAKING YOU UP AND SCARING YOU TO DEATH MY THREE NEGRO MEN STOOD GUARD
AT YOUR HOUSE ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT
THEY'VE JUST COME BACK
MORE VISITORS CAME AND THE STORY HAD TO BE TOLD AND RETOLD FOR A COUPLE
OF HOURS MORE
THERE WAS NO SABBATH SCHOOL DURING DAY SCHOOL VACATION BUT EVERYBODY
WAS EARLY AT CHURCH
THE STIRRING EVENT WAS WELL CANVASSED
NEWS CAME
THAT NOT A SIGN OF THE TWO VILLAINS HAD BEEN YET DISCOVERED
WHEN THE
SERMON WAS FINISHED JUDGE THATCHER'S WIFE DROPPED ALONGSIDE OF MRS
HARPER AS SHE MOVED DOWN THE AISLE WITH THE CROWD AND SAID
IS MY BECKY GOING TO SLEEP ALL DAY I JUST EXPECTED SHE WOULD BE TIRED
TO DEATH
YOUR BECKY
YES WITH A STARTLED LOOK DIDN'T SHE STAY WITH YOU LAST NIGHT
WHY NO
MRS
THATCHER TURNED PALE AND SANK INTO A PEW JUST AS AUNT POLLY
TALKING BRISKLY WITH A FRIEND PASSED BY
AUNT POLLY SAID
GOODMORNING MRS
THATCHER
GOODMORNING MRS
HARPER
I'VE GOT A BOY
THAT'S TURNED UP MISSING
I RECKON MY TOM STAYED AT YOUR HOUSE LAST
NIGHT ONE OF YOU
AND NOW HE'S AFRAID TO COME TO CHURCH
I'VE GOT TO
SETTLE WITH HIM
MRS
THATCHER SHOOK HER HEAD FEEBLY AND TURNED PALER THAN EVER
HE DIDN'T STAY WITH US SAID MRS
HARPER BEGINNING TO LOOK UNEASY
A
MARKED ANXIETY CAME INTO AUNT POLLY'S FACE
JOE HARPER HAVE YOU SEEN MY TOM THIS MORNING
NO'M
WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST
JOE TRIED TO REMEMBER BUT WAS NOT SURE HE COULD SAY
THE PEOPLE HAD
STOPPED MOVING OUT OF CHURCH
WHISPERS PASSED ALONG AND A BODING
UNEASINESS TOOK POSSESSION OF EVERY COUNTENANCE
CHILDREN WERE ANXIOUSLY
QUESTIONED AND YOUNG TEACHERS
THEY ALL SAID THEY HAD NOT NOTICED
WHETHER TOM AND BECKY WERE ON BOARD THE FERRYBOAT ON THE HOMEWARD TRIP
IT WAS DARK NO ONE THOUGHT OF INQUIRING IF ANY ONE WAS MISSING
ONE
YOUNG MAN FINALLY BLURTED OUT HIS FEAR THAT THEY WERE STILL IN THE CAVE
MRS
THATCHER SWOONED AWAY
AUNT POLLY FELL TO CRYING AND WRINGING HER
HANDS
THE ALARM SWEPT FROM LIP TO LIP FROM GROUP TO GROUP FROM STREET TO
STREET AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES THE BELLS WERE WILDLY CLANGING AND
THE WHOLE TOWN WAS UP THE CARDIFF HILL EPISODE SANK INTO INSTANT
INSIGNIFICANCE THE BURGLARS WERE FORGOTTEN HORSES WERE SADDLED SKIFFS
WERE MANNED THE FERRYBOAT ORDERED OUT AND BEFORE THE HORROR WAS HALF
AN HOUR OLD TWO HUNDRED MEN WERE POURING DOWN HIGHROAD AND RIVER TOWARD
THE CAVE
ALL THE LONG AFTERNOON THE VILLAGE SEEMED EMPTY AND DEAD
MANY WOMEN
VISITED AUNT POLLY AND MRS
THATCHER AND TRIED TO COMFORT THEM
THEY
CRIED WITH THEM TOO AND THAT WAS STILL BETTER THAN WORDS
ALL THE
TEDIOUS NIGHT THE TOWN WAITED FOR NEWS BUT WHEN THE MORNING DAWNED AT
LAST ALL THE WORD THAT CAME WAS SEND MORE CANDLES AND SEND FOOD
MRS
THATCHER WAS ALMOST CRAZED AND AUNT POLLY ALSO
JUDGE THATCHER
SENT MESSAGES OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE CAVE BUT THEY CONVEYED
NO REAL CHEER
THE OLD WELSHMAN CAME HOME TOWARD DAYLIGHT SPATTERED WITH
CANDLE GREASE SMEARED WITH CLAY AND ALMOST WORN OUT
HE FOUND HUCK
STILL IN THE BED THAT HAD BEEN PROVIDED FOR HIM AND DELIRIOUS WITH
FEVER
THE PHYSICIANS WERE ALL AT THE CAVE SO THE WIDOW DOUGLAS CAME
AND TOOK CHARGE OF THE PATIENT
SHE SAID SHE WOULD DO HER BEST BY HIM
BECAUSE WHETHER HE WAS GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT HE WAS THE LORD'S
AND NOTHING THAT WAS THE LORD'S WAS A THING TO BE NEGLECTED
THE
WELSHMAN SAID HUCK HAD GOOD SPOTS IN HIM AND THE WIDOW SAID
YOU CAN DEPEND ON IT
THAT'S THE LORD'S MARK
HE DON'T LEAVE IT OFF
HE NEVER DOES
PUTS IT SOMEWHERE ON EVERY CREATURE THAT COMES FROM HIS
HANDS
EARLY IN THE FORENOON PARTIES OF JADED MEN BEGAN TO STRAGGLE INTO THE
VILLAGE BUT THE STRONGEST OF THE CITIZENS CONTINUED SEARCHING
ALL THE
NEWS THAT COULD BE GAINED WAS THAT REMOTENESSES OF THE CAVERN WERE BEING
RANSACKED THAT HAD NEVER BEEN VISITED BEFORE THAT EVERY CORNER AND
CREVICE WAS GOING TO BE THOROUGHLY SEARCHED THAT WHEREVER ONE WANDERED
THROUGH THE MAZE OF PASSAGES LIGHTS WERE TO BE SEEN FLITTING HITHER
AND THITHER IN THE DISTANCE AND SHOUTINGS AND PISTOL SHOTS SENT THEIR
HOLLOW REVERBERATIONS TO THE EAR DOWN THE SOMBRE AISLES
IN ONE PLACE
FAR FROM THE SECTION USUALLY TRAVERSED BY TOURISTS THE NAMES BECKY
TOM HAD BEEN FOUND TRACED UPON THE ROCKY WALL WITH CANDLE SMOKE AND
NEAR AT HAND A GREASE SOILED BIT OF RIBBON
MRS
THATCHER RECOGNIZED THE
RIBBON AND CRIED OVER IT
SHE SAID IT WAS THE LAST RELIC SHE SHOULD EVER
HAVE OF HER CHILD AND THAT NO OTHER MEMORIAL OF HER COULD EVER BE SO
PRECIOUS BECAUSE THIS ONE PARTED LATEST FROM THE LIVING BODY BEFORE THE
AWFUL DEATH CAME
SOME SAID THAT NOW AND THEN IN THE CAVE A FAR AWAY
SPECK OF LIGHT WOULD GLIMMER AND THEN A GLORIOUS SHOUT WOULD BURST
FORTH AND A SCORE OF MEN GO TROOPING DOWN THE ECHOING AISLE AND THEN A
SICKENING DISAPPOINTMENT ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE CHILDREN WERE NOT THERE
IT WAS ONLY A SEARCHER'S LIGHT
THREE DREADFUL DAYS AND NIGHTS DRAGGED THEIR TEDIOUS HOURS ALONG AND
THE VILLAGE SANK INTO A HOPELESS STUPOR
NO ONE HAD HEART FOR ANYTHING
THE ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY JUST MADE THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THE
TEMPERANCE TAVERN KEPT LIQUOR ON HIS PREMISES SCARCELY FLUTTERED THE
PUBLIC PULSE TREMENDOUS AS THE FACT WAS
IN A LUCID INTERVAL HUCK
FEEBLY LED UP TO THE SUBJECT OF TAVERNS AND FINALLY ASKED DIMLY
DREADING THE WORST IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AT THE TEMPERANCE
TAVERN SINCE HE HAD BEEN ILL
YES SAID THE WIDOW
HUCK STARTED UP IN BED WILDEYED
WHAT WHAT WAS IT
LIQUOR AND THE PLACE HAS BEEN SHUT UP
LIE DOWN CHILD WHAT A TURN YOU
DID GIVE ME
ONLY TELL ME JUST ONE THING ONLY JUST ONE PLEASE WAS IT TOM SAWYER
THAT FOUND IT
THE WIDOW BURST INTO TEARS
HUSH HUSH CHILD HUSH I'VE TOLD YOU
BEFORE YOU MUST NOT TALK
YOU ARE VERY VERY SICK
THEN NOTHING BUT LIQUOR HAD BEEN FOUND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT
POWWOW IF IT HAD BEEN THE GOLD
SO THE TREASURE WAS GONE FOREVER GONE
FOREVER BUT WHAT COULD SHE BE CRYING ABOUT CURIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD
CRY
THESE THOUGHTS WORKED THEIR DIM WAY THROUGH HUCK'S MIND AND UNDER THE
WEARINESS THEY GAVE HIM HE FELL ASLEEP
THE WIDOW SAID TO HERSELF
THERE HE'S ASLEEP POOR WRECK
TOM SAWYER FIND IT PITY BUT SOMEBODY
COULD FIND TOM SAWYER AH THERE AIN'T MANY LEFT NOW THAT'S GOT HOPE
ENOUGH OR STRENGTH ENOUGH EITHER TO GO ON SEARCHING
CHAPTER XXXI
NOW TO RETURN TO TOM AND BECKY'S SHARE IN THE PICNIC
THEY TRIPPED ALONG
THE MURKY AISLES WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANY VISITING THE FAMILIAR
WONDERS OF THE CAVE WONDERS DUBBED WITH RATHER OVER DESCRIPTIVE NAMES
SUCH AS THE DRAWING ROOM THE CATHEDRAL ALADDIN'S PALACE AND
SO ON
PRESENTLY THE HIDE AND SEEK FROLICKING BEGAN AND TOM AND BECKY
ENGAGED IN IT WITH ZEAL UNTIL THE EXERTION BEGAN TO GROW A TRIFLE
WEARISOME THEN THEY WANDERED DOWN A SINUOUS AVENUE HOLDING THEIR
CANDLES ALOFT AND READING THE TANGLED WEBWORK OF NAMES DATES
POSTOFFICE ADDRESSES AND MOTTOES WITH WHICH THE ROCKY WALLS HAD BEEN
FRESCOED IN CANDLE SMOKE
STILL DRIFTING ALONG AND TALKING THEY
SCARCELY NOTICED THAT THEY WERE NOW IN A PART OF THE CAVE WHOSE WALLS
WERE NOT FRESCOED
THEY SMOKED THEIR OWN NAMES UNDER AN OVERHANGING
SHELF AND MOVED ON
PRESENTLY THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE A LITTLE STREAM
OF WATER TRICKLING OVER A LEDGE AND CARRYING A LIMESTONE SEDIMENT WITH
IT HAD IN THE SLOW DRAGGING AGES FORMED A LACED AND RUFFLED NIAGARA
IN GLEAMING AND IMPERISHABLE STONE
TOM SQUEEZED HIS SMALL BODY BEHIND
IT IN ORDER TO ILLUMINATE IT FOR BECKY'S GRATIFICATION
HE FOUND THAT
IT CURTAINED A SORT OF STEEP NATURAL STAIRWAY WHICH WAS ENCLOSED BETWEEN
NARROW WALLS AND AT ONCE THE AMBITION TO BE A DISCOVERER SEIZED HIM
BECKY RESPONDED TO HIS CALL AND THEY MADE A SMOKE MARK FOR FUTURE
GUIDANCE AND STARTED UPON THEIR QUEST
THEY WOUND THIS WAY AND THAT
FAR DOWN INTO THE SECRET DEPTHS OF THE CAVE MADE ANOTHER MARK AND
BRANCHED OFF IN SEARCH OF NOVELTIES TO TELL THE UPPER WORLD ABOUT
IN
ONE PLACE THEY FOUND A SPACIOUS CAVERN FROM WHOSE CEILING DEPENDED A
MULTITUDE OF SHINING STALACTITES OF THE LENGTH AND CIRCUMFERENCE OF
A MAN'S LEG THEY WALKED ALL ABOUT IT WONDERING AND ADMIRING AND
PRESENTLY LEFT IT BY ONE OF THE NUMEROUS PASSAGES THAT OPENED INTO
IT
THIS SHORTLY BROUGHT THEM TO A BEWITCHING SPRING WHOSE BASIN WAS
INCRUSTED WITH A FROSTWORK OF GLITTERING CRYSTALS IT WAS IN THE MIDST
OF A CAVERN WHOSE WALLS WERE SUPPORTED BY MANY FANTASTIC PILLARS WHICH
HAD BEEN FORMED BY THE JOINING OF GREAT STALACTITES AND STALAGMITES
TOGETHER THE RESULT OF THE CEASELESS WATER DRIP OF CENTURIES
UNDER THE
ROOF VAST KNOTS OF BATS HAD PACKED THEMSELVES TOGETHER THOUSANDS IN A
BUNCH THE LIGHTS DISTURBED THE CREATURES AND THEY CAME FLOCKING DOWN BY
HUNDREDS SQUEAKING AND DARTING FURIOUSLY AT THE CANDLES
TOM KNEW THEIR
WAYS AND THE DANGER OF THIS SORT OF CONDUCT
HE SEIZED BECKY'S HAND AND
HURRIED HER INTO THE FIRST CORRIDOR THAT OFFERED AND NONE TOO SOON FOR
A BAT STRUCK BECKY'S LIGHT OUT WITH ITS WING WHILE SHE WAS PASSING OUT
OF THE CAVERN
THE BATS CHASED THE CHILDREN A GOOD DISTANCE BUT THE
FUGITIVES PLUNGED INTO EVERY NEW PASSAGE THAT OFFERED AND AT LAST GOT
RID OF THE PERILOUS THINGS
TOM FOUND A SUBTERRANEAN LAKE SHORTLY
WHICH STRETCHED ITS DIM LENGTH AWAY UNTIL ITS SHAPE WAS LOST IN THE
SHADOWS
HE WANTED TO EXPLORE ITS BORDERS BUT CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULD
BE BEST TO SIT DOWN AND REST AWHILE FIRST
NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE
DEEP STILLNESS OF THE PLACE LAID A CLAMMY HAND UPON THE SPIRITS OF THE
CHILDREN
BECKY SAID
WHY I DIDN'T NOTICE BUT IT SEEMS EVER SO LONG SINCE I HEARD ANY OF
THE OTHERS
COME TO THINK BECKY WE ARE AWAY DOWN BELOW THEM AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
FAR AWAY NORTH OR SOUTH OR EAST OR WHICHEVER IT IS
WE COULDN'T HEAR
THEM HERE
BECKY GREW APPREHENSIVE
I WONDER HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN DOWN HERE TOM WE BETTER START BACK
YES I RECKON WE BETTER
P'RAPS WE BETTER
CAN YOU FIND THE WAY TOM IT'S ALL A MIXED UP CROOKEDNESS TO ME
I RECKON I COULD FIND IT BUT THEN THE BATS
IF THEY PUT OUR CANDLES
OUT IT WILL BE AN AWFUL FIX
LET'S TRY SOME OTHER WAY SO AS NOT TO GO
THROUGH THERE
WELL
BUT I HOPE WE WON'T GET LOST
IT WOULD BE SO AWFUL AND THE GIRL
SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF THE DREADFUL POSSIBILITIES
THEY STARTED THROUGH A CORRIDOR AND TRAVERSED IT IN SILENCE A LONG
WAY GLANCING AT EACH NEW OPENING TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING FAMILIAR
ABOUT THE LOOK OF IT BUT THEY WERE ALL STRANGE
EVERY TIME TOM MADE AN
EXAMINATION BECKY WOULD WATCH HIS FACE FOR AN ENCOURAGING SIGN AND HE
WOULD SAY CHEERILY
OH IT'S ALL RIGHT
THIS AIN'T THE ONE BUT WE'LL COME TO IT RIGHT
AWAY
BUT HE FELT LESS AND LESS HOPEFUL WITH EACH FAILURE AND PRESENTLY BEGAN
TO TURN OFF INTO DIVERGING AVENUES AT SHEER RANDOM IN DESPERATE HOPE OF
FINDING THE ONE THAT WAS WANTED
HE STILL SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT BUT
THERE WAS SUCH A LEADEN DREAD AT HIS HEART THAT THE WORDS HAD LOST THEIR
RING AND SOUNDED JUST AS IF HE HAD SAID ALL IS LOST BECKY CLUNG TO
HIS SIDE IN AN ANGUISH OF FEAR AND TRIED HARD TO KEEP BACK THE TEARS
BUT THEY WOULD COME
AT LAST SHE SAID
OH TOM NEVER MIND THE BATS LET'S GO BACK THAT WAY WE SEEM TO GET
WORSE AND WORSE OFF ALL THE TIME
LISTEN SAID HE
PROFOUND SILENCE SILENCE SO DEEP THAT EVEN THEIR BREATHINGS WERE
CONSPICUOUS IN THE HUSH
TOM SHOUTED
THE CALL WENT ECHOING DOWN
THE EMPTY AISLES AND DIED OUT IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT SOUND THAT
RESEMBLED A RIPPLE OF MOCKING LAUGHTER
OH DON'T DO IT AGAIN TOM IT IS TOO HORRID SAID BECKY
IT IS HORRID BUT I BETTER BECKY THEY MIGHT HEAR US YOU KNOW AND
HE SHOUTED AGAIN
THE MIGHT WAS EVEN A CHILLIER HORROR THAN THE GHOSTLY LAUGHTER IT SO
CONFESSED A PERISHING HOPE
THE CHILDREN STOOD STILL AND LISTENED BUT
THERE WAS NO RESULT
TOM TURNED UPON THE BACK TRACK AT ONCE AND HURRIED
HIS STEPS
IT WAS BUT A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE A CERTAIN INDECISION IN HIS
MANNER REVEALED ANOTHER FEARFUL FACT TO BECKY HE COULD NOT FIND HIS WAY
BACK
OH TOM YOU DIDN'T MAKE ANY MARKS
BECKY I WAS SUCH A FOOL SUCH A FOOL I NEVER THOUGHT WE MIGHT WANT TO
COME BACK NO I CAN'T FIND THE WAY
IT'S ALL MIXED UP
TOM TOM WE'RE LOST WE'RE LOST WE NEVER CAN GET OUT OF THIS AWFUL
PLACE OH WHY DID WE EVER LEAVE THE OTHERS
SHE SANK TO THE GROUND AND BURST INTO SUCH A FRENZY OF CRYING THAT TOM
WAS APPALLED WITH THE IDEA THAT SHE MIGHT DIE OR LOSE HER REASON
HE
SAT DOWN BY HER AND PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER SHE BURIED HER FACE IN
HIS BOSOM SHE CLUNG TO HIM SHE POURED OUT HER TERRORS HER UNAVAILING
REGRETS AND THE FAR ECHOES TURNED THEM ALL TO JEERING LAUGHTER
TOM
BEGGED HER TO PLUCK UP HOPE AGAIN AND SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT
HE FELL
TO BLAMING AND ABUSING HIMSELF FOR GETTING HER INTO THIS MISERABLE
SITUATION THIS HAD A BETTER EFFECT
SHE SAID SHE WOULD TRY TO HOPE
AGAIN SHE WOULD GET UP AND FOLLOW WHEREVER HE MIGHT LEAD IF ONLY HE
WOULD NOT TALK LIKE THAT ANY MORE
FOR HE WAS NO MORE TO BLAME THAN SHE
SHE SAID
SO THEY MOVED ON AGAIN AIMLESSLY SIMPLY AT RANDOM ALL THEY COULD DO
WAS TO MOVE KEEP MOVING
FOR A LITTLE WHILE HOPE MADE A SHOW OF
REVIVING NOT WITH ANY REASON TO BACK IT BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS ITS
NATURE TO REVIVE WHEN THE SPRING HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN OUT OF IT BY AGE AND
FAMILIARITY WITH FAILURE
BY AND BY TOM TOOK BECKY'S CANDLE AND BLEW IT OUT
THIS ECONOMY MEANT SO
MUCH WORDS WERE NOT NEEDED
BECKY UNDERSTOOD AND HER HOPE DIED AGAIN
SHE KNEW THAT TOM HAD A WHOLE CANDLE AND THREE OR FOUR PIECES IN HIS
POCKETS YET HE MUST ECONOMIZE
BY AND BY FATIGUE BEGAN TO ASSERT ITS CLAIMS THE CHILDREN TRIED TO PAY
ATTENTION FOR IT WAS DREADFUL TO THINK OF SITTING DOWN WHEN TIME WAS
GROWN TO BE SO PRECIOUS MOVING IN SOME DIRECTION IN ANY DIRECTION
WAS AT LEAST PROGRESS AND MIGHT BEAR FRUIT BUT TO SIT DOWN WAS TO
INVITE DEATH AND SHORTEN ITS PURSUIT
AT LAST BECKY'S FRAIL LIMBS REFUSED TO CARRY HER FARTHER
SHE SAT DOWN
TOM RESTED WITH HER AND THEY TALKED OF HOME AND THE FRIENDS THERE
AND THE COMFORTABLE BEDS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHT BECKY CRIED AND TOM
TRIED TO THINK OF SOME WAY OF COMFORTING HER BUT ALL HIS ENCOURAGEMENTS
WERE GROWN THREAD BARE WITH USE AND SOUNDED LIKE SARCASMS
FATIGUE BORE
SO HEAVILY UPON BECKY THAT SHE DROWSED OFF TO SLEEP
TOM WAS GRATEFUL
HE SAT LOOKING INTO HER DRAWN FACE AND SAW IT GROW SMOOTH AND NATURAL
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PLEASANT DREAMS AND BY AND BY A SMILE DAWNED AND
RESTED THERE
THE PEACEFUL FACE REFLECTED SOMEWHAT OF PEACE AND HEALING
INTO HIS OWN SPIRIT AND HIS THOUGHTS WANDERED AWAY TO BYGONE TIMES AND
DREAMY MEMORIES
WHILE HE WAS DEEP IN HIS MUSINGS BECKY WOKE UP WITH A
BREEZY LITTLE LAUGH BUT IT WAS STRICKEN DEAD UPON HER LIPS AND A GROAN
FOLLOWED IT
OH HOW COULD I SLEEP I WISH I NEVER NEVER HAD WAKED NO NO I
DON'T TOM DON'T LOOK SO I WON'T SAY IT AGAIN
I'M GLAD YOU'VE SLEPT BECKY YOU'LL FEEL RESTED NOW AND WE'LL FIND
THE WAY OUT
WE CAN TRY TOM BUT I'VE SEEN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY IN MY DREAM
I
RECKON WE ARE GOING THERE
MAYBE NOT MAYBE NOT
CHEER UP BECKY AND LET'S GO ON TRYING
THEY ROSE UP AND WANDERED ALONG HAND IN HAND AND HOPELESS
THEY TRIED
TO ESTIMATE HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CAVE BUT ALL THEY KNEW WAS
THAT IT SEEMED DAYS AND WEEKS AND YET IT WAS PLAIN THAT THIS COULD NOT
BE FOR THEIR CANDLES WERE NOT GONE YET
A LONG TIME AFTER THIS THEY
COULD NOT TELL HOW LONG TOM SAID THEY MUST GO SOFTLY AND LISTEN FOR
DRIPPING WATER THEY MUST FIND A SPRING
THEY FOUND ONE PRESENTLY AND
TOM SAID IT WAS TIME TO REST AGAIN
BOTH WERE CRUELLY TIRED YET BECKY
SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GO A LITTLE FARTHER
SHE WAS SURPRISED TO
HEAR TOM DISSENT
SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT
THEY SAT DOWN AND TOM
FASTENED HIS CANDLE TO THE WALL IN FRONT OF THEM WITH SOME CLAY
THOUGHT
WAS SOON BUSY NOTHING WAS SAID FOR SOME TIME
THEN BECKY BROKE THE
SILENCE
TOM I AM SO HUNGRY
TOM TOOK SOMETHING OUT OF HIS POCKET
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS SAID HE
BECKY ALMOST SMILED
IT'S OUR WEDDING CAKE TOM
YES I WISH IT WAS AS BIG AS A BARREL FOR IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT
I SAVED IT FROM THE PICNIC FOR US TO DREAM ON TOM THE WAY GROWNUP
PEOPLE DO WITH WEDDING CAKE BUT IT'LL BE OUR
SHE DROPPED THE SENTENCE WHERE IT WAS
TOM DIVIDED THE CAKE AND BECKY
ATE WITH GOOD APPETITE WHILE TOM NIBBLED AT HIS MOIETY
THERE WAS
ABUNDANCE OF COLD WATER TO FINISH THE FEAST WITH
BY AND BY BECKY
SUGGESTED THAT THEY MOVE ON AGAIN
TOM WAS SILENT A MOMENT
THEN HE
SAID
BECKY CAN YOU BEAR IT IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING
BECKY'S FACE PALED BUT SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD
WELL THEN BECKY WE MUST STAY HERE WHERE THERE'S WATER TO DRINK
THAT LITTLE PIECE IS OUR LAST CANDLE
BECKY GAVE LOOSE TO TEARS AND WAILINGS
TOM DID WHAT HE COULD TO COMFORT
HER BUT WITH LITTLE EFFECT
AT LENGTH BECKY SAID
TOM
WELL BECKY
THEY'LL MISS US AND HUNT FOR US
YES THEY WILL CERTAINLY THEY WILL
MAYBE THEY'RE HUNTING FOR US NOW TOM
WHY I RECKON MAYBE THEY ARE
I HOPE THEY ARE
WHEN WOULD THEY MISS US TOM
WHEN THEY GET BACK TO THE BOAT I RECKON
TOM IT MIGHT BE DARK THEN WOULD THEY NOTICE WE HADN'T COME
I DON'T KNOW
BUT ANYWAY YOUR MOTHER WOULD MISS YOU AS SOON AS THEY
GOT HOME
A FRIGHTENED LOOK IN BECKY'S FACE BROUGHT TOM TO HIS SENSES AND HE SAW
THAT HE HAD MADE A BLUNDER
BECKY WAS NOT TO HAVE GONE HOME THAT NIGHT
THE CHILDREN BECAME SILENT AND THOUGHTFUL
IN A MOMENT A NEW BURST OF
GRIEF FROM BECKY SHOWED TOM THAT THE THING IN HIS MIND HAD STRUCK HERS
ALSO THAT THE SABBATH MORNING MIGHT BE HALF SPENT BEFORE MRS
THATCHER
DISCOVERED THAT BECKY WAS NOT AT MRS
HARPER'S
THE CHILDREN FASTENED THEIR EYES UPON THEIR BIT OF CANDLE AND WATCHED IT
MELT SLOWLY AND PITILESSLY AWAY SAW THE HALF INCH OF WICK STAND ALONE
AT LAST SAW THE FEEBLE FLAME RISE AND FALL CLIMB THE THIN COLUMN OF
SMOKE LINGER AT ITS TOP A MOMENT AND THEN THE HORROR OF UTTER DARKNESS
REIGNED
HOW LONG AFTERWARD IT WAS THAT BECKY CAME TO A SLOW CONSCIOUSNESS THAT
SHE WAS CRYING IN TOM'S ARMS NEITHER COULD TELL
ALL THAT THEY KNEW
WAS THAT AFTER WHAT SEEMED A MIGHTY STRETCH OF TIME BOTH AWOKE OUT OF
A DEAD STUPOR OF SLEEP AND RESUMED THEIR MISERIES ONCE MORE
TOM SAID
IT MIGHT BE SUNDAY NOW MAYBE MONDAY
HE TRIED TO GET BECKY TO TALK BUT
HER SORROWS WERE TOO OPPRESSIVE ALL HER HOPES WERE GONE
TOM SAID THAT
THEY MUST HAVE BEEN MISSED LONG AGO AND NO DOUBT THE SEARCH WAS GOING
ON
HE WOULD SHOUT AND MAYBE SOME ONE WOULD COME
HE TRIED IT BUT IN
THE DARKNESS THE DISTANT ECHOES SOUNDED SO HIDEOUSLY THAT HE TRIED IT NO
MORE
THE HOURS WASTED AWAY AND HUNGER CAME TO TORMENT THE CAPTIVES AGAIN
A
PORTION OF TOM'S HALF OF THE CAKE WAS LEFT THEY DIVIDED AND ATE IT
BUT
THEY SEEMED HUNGRIER THAN BEFORE
THE POOR MORSEL OF FOOD ONLY WHETTED
DESIRE
BY AND BY TOM SAID
SH DID YOU HEAR THAT
BOTH HELD THEIR BREATH AND LISTENED
THERE WAS A SOUND LIKE THE
FAINTEST FAR OFF SHOUT
INSTANTLY TOM ANSWERED IT AND LEADING BECKY BY
THE HAND STARTED GROPING DOWN THE CORRIDOR IN ITS DIRECTION
PRESENTLY
HE LISTENED AGAIN AGAIN THE SOUND WAS HEARD AND APPARENTLY A LITTLE
NEARER
IT'S THEM SAID TOM THEY'RE COMING COME ALONG BECKY WE'RE ALL
RIGHT NOW
THE JOY OF THE PRISONERS WAS ALMOST OVERWHELMING
THEIR SPEED WAS SLOW
HOWEVER BECAUSE PITFALLS WERE SOMEWHAT COMMON AND HAD TO BE GUARDED
AGAINST
THEY SHORTLY CAME TO ONE AND HAD TO STOP
IT MIGHT BE THREE
FEET DEEP IT MIGHT BE A HUNDRED THERE WAS NO PASSING IT AT ANY RATE
TOM GOT DOWN ON HIS BREAST AND REACHED AS FAR DOWN AS HE COULD
NO
BOTTOM
THEY MUST STAY THERE AND WAIT UNTIL THE SEARCHERS CAME
THEY
LISTENED EVIDENTLY THE DISTANT SHOUTINGS WERE GROWING MORE DISTANT
A MOMENT OR TWO MORE AND THEY HAD GONE ALTOGETHER
THE HEART SINKING
MISERY OF IT TOM WHOOPED UNTIL HE WAS HOARSE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE
HE
TALKED HOPEFULLY TO BECKY BUT AN AGE OF ANXIOUS WAITING PASSED AND NO
SOUNDS CAME AGAIN
THE CHILDREN GROPED THEIR WAY BACK TO THE SPRING
THE WEARY TIME DRAGGED
ON THEY SLEPT AGAIN AND AWOKE FAMISHED AND WOE STRICKEN
TOM BELIEVED
IT MUST BE TUESDAY BY THIS TIME
NOW AN IDEA STRUCK HIM
THERE WERE SOME SIDE PASSAGES NEAR AT HAND
IT
WOULD BE BETTER TO EXPLORE SOME OF THESE THAN BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE
HEAVY TIME IN IDLENESS
HE TOOK A KITE LINE FROM HIS POCKET TIED IT TO
A PROJECTION AND HE AND BECKY STARTED TOM IN THE LEAD UNWINDING THE
LINE AS HE GROPED ALONG
AT THE END OF TWENTY STEPS THE CORRIDOR ENDED
IN A JUMPING OFF PLACE TOM GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND FELT BELOW
AND THEN AS FAR AROUND THE CORNER AS HE COULD REACH WITH HIS HANDS
CONVENIENTLY HE MADE AN EFFORT TO STRETCH YET A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE
RIGHT AND AT THAT MOMENT NOT TWENTY YARDS AWAY A HUMAN HAND HOLDING
A CANDLE APPEARED FROM BEHIND A ROCK TOM LIFTED UP A GLORIOUS SHOUT
AND INSTANTLY THAT HAND WAS FOLLOWED BY THE BODY IT BELONGED TO INJUN
JOE'S TOM WAS PARALYZED HE COULD NOT MOVE
HE WAS VASTLY GRATIFIED THE
NEXT MOMENT TO SEE THE SPANIARD TAKE TO HIS HEELS AND GET HIMSELF OUT
OF SIGHT
TOM WONDERED THAT JOE HAD NOT RECOGNIZED HIS VOICE AND COME
OVER AND KILLED HIM FOR TESTIFYING IN COURT
BUT THE ECHOES MUST HAVE
DISGUISED THE VOICE
WITHOUT DOUBT THAT WAS IT HE REASONED
TOM'S
FRIGHT WEAKENED EVERY MUSCLE IN HIS BODY
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IF HE
HAD STRENGTH ENOUGH TO GET BACK TO THE SPRING HE WOULD STAY THERE AND
NOTHING SHOULD TEMPT HIM TO RUN THE RISK OF MEETING INJUN JOE AGAIN
HE
WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP FROM BECKY WHAT IT WAS HE HAD SEEN
HE TOLD HER HE
HAD ONLY SHOUTED FOR LUCK
BUT HUNGER AND WRETCHEDNESS RISE SUPERIOR TO FEARS IN THE LONG RUN
ANOTHER TEDIOUS WAIT AT THE SPRING AND ANOTHER LONG SLEEP BROUGHT
CHANGES
THE CHILDREN AWOKE TORTURED WITH A RAGING HUNGER
TOM BELIEVED
THAT IT MUST BE WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY OR EVEN FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NOW
AND THAT THE SEARCH HAD BEEN GIVEN OVER
HE PROPOSED TO EXPLORE ANOTHER
PASSAGE
HE FELT WILLING TO RISK INJUN JOE AND ALL OTHER TERRORS
BUT
BECKY WAS VERY WEAK
SHE HAD SUNK INTO A DREARY APATHY AND WOULD NOT BE
ROUSED
SHE SAID SHE WOULD WAIT NOW WHERE SHE WAS AND DIE IT WOULD
NOT BE LONG
SHE TOLD TOM TO GO WITH THE KITE LINE AND EXPLORE IF HE
CHOSE BUT SHE IMPLORED HIM TO COME BACK EVERY LITTLE WHILE AND SPEAK
TO HER AND SHE MADE HIM PROMISE THAT WHEN THE AWFUL TIME CAME HE WOULD
STAY BY HER AND HOLD HER HAND UNTIL ALL WAS OVER
TOM KISSED HER WITH A CHOKING SENSATION IN HIS THROAT AND MADE A SHOW
OF BEING CONFIDENT OF FINDING THE SEARCHERS OR AN ESCAPE FROM THE CAVE
THEN HE TOOK THE KITE LINE IN HIS HAND AND WENT GROPING DOWN ONE OF THE
PASSAGES ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES DISTRESSED WITH HUNGER AND SICK WITH
BODINGS OF COMING DOOM
CHAPTER XXXII
TUESDAY AFTERNOON CAME AND WANED TO THE TWILIGHT
THE VILLAGE OF ST
PETERSBURG STILL MOURNED
THE LOST CHILDREN HAD NOT BEEN FOUND
PUBLIC
PRAYERS HAD BEEN OFFERED UP FOR THEM AND MANY AND MANY A PRIVATE PRAYER
THAT HAD THE PETITIONER'S WHOLE HEART IN IT BUT STILL NO GOOD NEWS CAME
FROM THE CAVE
THE MAJORITY OF THE SEARCHERS HAD GIVEN UP THE QUEST
AND GONE BACK TO THEIR DAILY AVOCATIONS SAYING THAT IT WAS PLAIN THE
CHILDREN COULD NEVER BE FOUND
MRS
THATCHER WAS VERY ILL AND A GREAT
PART OF THE TIME DELIRIOUS
PEOPLE SAID IT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR HER
CALL HER CHILD AND RAISE HER HEAD AND LISTEN A WHOLE MINUTE AT A TIME
THEN LAY IT WEARILY DOWN AGAIN WITH A MOAN
AUNT POLLY HAD DROOPED INTO
A SETTLED MELANCHOLY AND HER GRAY HAIR HAD GROWN ALMOST WHITE
THE
VILLAGE WENT TO ITS REST ON TUESDAY NIGHT SAD AND FORLORN
AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT A WILD PEAL BURST FROM THE VILLAGE
BELLS AND IN A MOMENT THE STREETS WERE SWARMING WITH FRANTIC HALF CLAD
PEOPLE WHO SHOUTED TURN OUT TURN OUT THEY'RE FOUND THEY'RE FOUND
TIN PANS AND HORNS WERE ADDED TO THE DIN THE POPULATION MASSED ITSELF
AND MOVED TOWARD THE RIVER MET THE CHILDREN COMING IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE
DRAWN BY SHOUTING CITIZENS THRONGED AROUND IT JOINED ITS HOMEWARD
MARCH AND SWEPT MAGNIFICENTLY UP THE MAIN STREET ROARING HUZZAH AFTER
HUZZAH
THE VILLAGE WAS ILLUMINATED NOBODY WENT TO BED AGAIN IT WAS THE
GREATEST NIGHT THE LITTLE TOWN HAD EVER SEEN
DURING THE FIRST HALF HOUR
A PROCESSION OF VILLAGERS FILED THROUGH JUDGE THATCHER'S HOUSE SEIZED
THE SAVED ONES AND KISSED THEM SQUEEZED MRS
THATCHER'S HAND TRIED TO
SPEAK BUT COULDN'T AND DRIFTED OUT RAINING TEARS ALL OVER THE PLACE
AUNT POLLY'S HAPPINESS WAS COMPLETE AND MRS
THATCHER'S NEARLY SO
IT
WOULD BE COMPLETE HOWEVER AS SOON AS THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED WITH THE
GREAT NEWS TO THE CAVE SHOULD GET THE WORD TO HER HUSBAND
TOM LAY UPON
A SOFA WITH AN EAGER AUDITORY ABOUT HIM AND TOLD THE HISTORY OF THE
WONDERFUL ADVENTURE PUTTING IN MANY STRIKING ADDITIONS TO ADORN IT
WITHAL AND CLOSED WITH A DESCRIPTION OF HOW HE LEFT BECKY AND WENT
ON AN EXPLORING EXPEDITION HOW HE FOLLOWED TWO AVENUES AS FAR AS HIS
KITE LINE WOULD REACH HOW HE FOLLOWED A THIRD TO THE FULLEST STRETCH
OF THE KITE LINE AND WAS ABOUT TO TURN BACK WHEN HE GLIMPSED A FAR OFF
SPECK THAT LOOKED LIKE DAYLIGHT DROPPED THE LINE AND GROPED TOWARD IT
PUSHED HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS THROUGH A SMALL HOLE AND SAW THE BROAD
MISSISSIPPI ROLLING BY
AND IF IT HAD ONLY HAPPENED TO BE NIGHT HE WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN THAT
SPECK OF DAYLIGHT AND WOULD NOT HAVE EXPLORED THAT PASSAGE ANY MORE HE
TOLD HOW HE WENT BACK FOR BECKY AND BROKE THE GOOD NEWS AND SHE TOLD
HIM NOT TO FRET HER WITH SUCH STUFF FOR SHE WAS TIRED AND KNEW SHE WAS
GOING TO DIE AND WANTED TO
HE DESCRIBED HOW HE LABORED WITH HER AND
CONVINCED HER AND HOW SHE ALMOST DIED FOR JOY WHEN SHE HAD GROPED TO
WHERE SHE ACTUALLY SAW THE BLUE SPECK OF DAYLIGHT HOW HE PUSHED HIS WAY
OUT AT THE HOLE AND THEN HELPED HER OUT HOW THEY SAT THERE AND CRIED
FOR GLADNESS HOW SOME MEN CAME ALONG IN A SKIFF AND TOM HAILED THEM
AND TOLD THEM THEIR SITUATION AND THEIR FAMISHED CONDITION HOW THE MEN
DIDN'T BELIEVE THE WILD TALE AT FIRST BECAUSE SAID THEY YOU ARE
FIVE MILES DOWN THE RIVER BELOW THE VALLEY THE CAVE IS IN THEN TOOK
THEM ABOARD ROWED TO A HOUSE GAVE THEM SUPPER MADE THEM REST TILL TWO
OR THREE HOURS AFTER DARK AND THEN BROUGHT THEM HOME
BEFORE DAY DAWN JUDGE THATCHER AND THE HANDFUL OF SEARCHERS WITH HIM
WERE TRACKED OUT IN THE CAVE BY THE TWINE CLEWS THEY HAD STRUNG BEHIND
THEM AND INFORMED OF THE GREAT NEWS
THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF TOIL AND HUNGER IN THE CAVE WERE NOT TO
BE SHAKEN OFF AT ONCE AS TOM AND BECKY SOON DISCOVERED
THEY WERE
BEDRIDDEN ALL OF WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AND SEEMED TO GROW MORE AND
MORE TIRED AND WORN ALL THE TIME
TOM GOT ABOUT A LITTLE ON THURSDAY
WAS DOWNTOWN FRIDAY AND NEARLY AS WHOLE AS EVER SATURDAY BUT BECKY
DID NOT LEAVE HER ROOM UNTIL SUNDAY AND THEN SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE HAD
PASSED THROUGH A WASTING ILLNESS
TOM LEARNED OF HUCK'S SICKNESS AND WENT TO SEE HIM ON FRIDAY BUT COULD
NOT BE ADMITTED TO THE BEDROOM NEITHER COULD HE ON SATURDAY OR SUNDAY
HE WAS ADMITTED DAILY AFTER THAT BUT WAS WARNED TO KEEP STILL ABOUT HIS
ADVENTURE AND INTRODUCE NO EXCITING TOPIC
THE WIDOW DOUGLAS STAYED BY
TO SEE THAT HE OBEYED
AT HOME TOM LEARNED OF THE CARDIFF HILL EVENT
ALSO THAT THE RAGGED MAN'S BODY HAD EVENTUALLY BEEN FOUND IN THE RIVER
NEAR THE FERRY LANDING HE HAD BEEN DROWNED WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE
PERHAPS
ABOUT A FORTNIGHT AFTER TOM'S RESCUE FROM THE CAVE HE STARTED OFF TO
VISIT HUCK WHO HAD GROWN PLENTY STRONG ENOUGH NOW TO HEAR EXCITING
TALK AND TOM HAD SOME THAT WOULD INTEREST HIM HE THOUGHT
JUDGE
THATCHER'S HOUSE WAS ON TOM'S WAY AND HE STOPPED TO SEE BECKY
THE
JUDGE AND SOME FRIENDS SET TOM TO TALKING AND SOME ONE ASKED HIM
IRONICALLY IF HE WOULDN'T LIKE TO GO TO THE CAVE AGAIN
TOM SAID HE
THOUGHT HE WOULDN'T MIND IT
THE JUDGE SAID
WELL THERE ARE OTHERS JUST LIKE YOU TOM I'VE NOT THE LEAST DOUBT
BUT WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THAT
NOBODY WILL GET LOST IN THAT CAVE ANY
MORE
WHY
BECAUSE I HAD ITS BIG DOOR SHEATHED WITH BOILER IRON TWO WEEKS AGO AND
TRIPLE LOCKED AND I'VE GOT THE KEYS
TOM TURNED AS WHITE AS A SHEET
WHAT'S THE MATTER BOY HERE RUN SOMEBODY FETCH A GLASS OF WATER
THE WATER WAS BROUGHT AND THROWN INTO TOM'S FACE
AH NOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH YOU TOM
OH JUDGE INJUN JOE'S IN THE CAVE
CHAPTER XXXIII
WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THE NEWS HAD SPREAD AND A DOZEN SKIFF LOADS OF
MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO MCDOUGAL'S CAVE AND THE FERRYBOAT WELL FILLED
WITH PASSENGERS SOON FOLLOWED
TOM SAWYER WAS IN THE SKIFF THAT BORE
JUDGE THATCHER
WHEN THE CAVE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED A SORROWFUL SIGHT PRESENTED ITSELF IN
THE DIM TWILIGHT OF THE PLACE
INJUN JOE LAY STRETCHED UPON THE GROUND
DEAD WITH HIS FACE CLOSE TO THE CRACK OF THE DOOR AS IF HIS LONGING
EYES HAD BEEN FIXED TO THE LATEST MOMENT UPON THE LIGHT AND THE CHEER
OF THE FREE WORLD OUTSIDE
TOM WAS TOUCHED FOR HE KNEW BY HIS OWN
EXPERIENCE HOW THIS WRETCH HAD SUFFERED
HIS PITY WAS MOVED BUT
NEVERTHELESS HE FELT AN ABOUNDING SENSE OF RELIEF AND SECURITY NOW
WHICH REVEALED TO HIM IN A DEGREE WHICH HE HAD NOT FULLY APPRECIATED
BEFORE HOW VAST A WEIGHT OF DREAD HAD BEEN LYING UPON HIM SINCE THE DAY
HE LIFTED HIS VOICE AGAINST THIS BLOODY MINDED OUTCAST
INJUN JOE'S BOWIE KNIFE LAY CLOSE BY ITS BLADE BROKEN IN TWO
THE GREAT
FOUNDATION BEAM OF THE DOOR HAD BEEN CHIPPED AND HACKED THROUGH WITH
TEDIOUS LABOR USELESS LABOR TOO IT WAS FOR THE NATIVE ROCK FORMED A
SILL OUTSIDE IT AND UPON THAT STUBBORN MATERIAL THE KNIFE HAD WROUGHT
NO EFFECT THE ONLY DAMAGE DONE WAS TO THE KNIFE ITSELF
BUT IF THERE
HAD BEEN NO STONY OBSTRUCTION THERE THE LABOR WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS
STILL FOR IF THE BEAM HAD BEEN WHOLLY CUT AWAY INJUN JOE COULD NOT HAVE
SQUEEZED HIS BODY UNDER THE DOOR AND HE KNEW IT
SO HE HAD ONLY HACKED
THAT PLACE IN ORDER TO BE DOING SOMETHING IN ORDER TO PASS THE WEARY
TIME IN ORDER TO EMPLOY HIS TORTURED FACULTIES
ORDINARILY ONE COULD
FIND HALF A DOZEN BITS OF CANDLE STUCK AROUND IN THE CREVICES OF THIS
VESTIBULE LEFT THERE BY TOURISTS BUT THERE WERE NONE NOW
THE PRISONER
HAD SEARCHED THEM OUT AND EATEN THEM
HE HAD ALSO CONTRIVED TO CATCH A
FEW BATS AND THESE ALSO HE HAD EATEN LEAVING ONLY THEIR CLAWS
THE
POOR UNFORTUNATE HAD STARVED TO DEATH
IN ONE PLACE NEAR AT HAND A
STALAGMITE HAD BEEN SLOWLY GROWING UP FROM THE GROUND FOR AGES BUILDED
BY THE WATER DRIP FROM A STALACTITE OVERHEAD
THE CAPTIVE HAD BROKEN OFF
THE STALAGMITE AND UPON THE STUMP HAD PLACED A STONE WHEREIN HE HAD
SCOOPED A SHALLOW HOLLOW TO CATCH THE PRECIOUS DROP THAT FELL ONCE
IN EVERY THREE MINUTES WITH THE DREARY REGULARITY OF A CLOCK TICK A
DESSERTSPOONFUL ONCE IN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS
THAT DROP WAS FALLING
WHEN THE PYRAMIDS WERE NEW WHEN TROY FELL WHEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF ROME
WERE LAID WHEN CHRIST WAS CRUCIFIED WHEN THE CONQUEROR CREATED THE
BRITISH EMPIRE WHEN COLUMBUS SAILED WHEN THE MASSACRE AT LEXINGTON WAS
NEWS
IT IS FALLING NOW IT WILL STILL BE FALLING WHEN ALL THESE THINGS SHALL
HAVE SUNK DOWN THE AFTERNOON OF HISTORY AND THE TWILIGHT OF TRADITION
AND BEEN SWALLOWED UP IN THE THICK NIGHT OF OBLIVION
HAS EVERYTHING A
PURPOSE AND A MISSION DID THIS DROP FALL PATIENTLY DURING FIVE THOUSAND
YEARS TO BE READY FOR THIS FLITTING HUMAN INSECT'S NEED AND HAS IT
ANOTHER IMPORTANT OBJECT TO ACCOMPLISH TEN THOUSAND YEARS TO COME NO
MATTER
IT IS MANY AND MANY A YEAR SINCE THE HAPLESS HALF BREED SCOOPED
OUT THE STONE TO CATCH THE PRICELESS DROPS BUT TO THIS DAY THE TOURIST
STARES LONGEST AT THAT PATHETIC STONE AND THAT SLOW DROPPING WATER WHEN
HE COMES TO SEE THE WONDERS OF MCDOUGAL'S CAVE
INJUN JOE'S CUP STANDS
FIRST IN THE LIST OF THE CAVERN'S MARVELS EVEN ALADDIN'S PALACE
CANNOT RIVAL IT
INJUN JOE WAS BURIED NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AND PEOPLE FLOCKED
THERE IN BOATS AND WAGONS FROM THE TOWNS AND FROM ALL THE FARMS AND
HAMLETS FOR SEVEN MILES AROUND THEY BROUGHT THEIR CHILDREN AND
ALL SORTS OF PROVISIONS AND CONFESSED THAT THEY HAD HAD ALMOST AS
SATISFACTORY A TIME AT THE FUNERAL AS THEY COULD HAVE HAD AT THE
HANGING
THIS FUNERAL STOPPED THE FURTHER GROWTH OF ONE THING THE PETITION TO THE
GOVERNOR FOR INJUN JOE'S PARDON
THE PETITION HAD BEEN LARGELY SIGNED
MANY TEARFUL AND ELOQUENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN HELD AND A COMMITTEE OF
SAPPY WOMEN BEEN APPOINTED TO GO IN DEEP MOURNING AND WAIL AROUND THE
GOVERNOR AND IMPLORE HIM TO BE A MERCIFUL ASS AND TRAMPLE HIS DUTY
UNDER FOOT
INJUN JOE WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED FIVE CITIZENS OF THE
VILLAGE BUT WHAT OF THAT IF HE HAD BEEN SATAN HIMSELF THERE WOULD
HAVE BEEN PLENTY OF WEAKLINGS READY TO SCRIBBLE THEIR NAMES TO A
PARDON PETITION AND DRIP A TEAR ON IT FROM THEIR PERMANENTLY IMPAIRED
AND LEAKY WATER WORKS
THE MORNING AFTER THE FUNERAL TOM TOOK HUCK TO A PRIVATE PLACE TO HAVE
AN IMPORTANT TALK
HUCK HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT TOM'S ADVENTURE FROM THE
WELSHMAN AND THE WIDOW DOUGLAS BY THIS TIME BUT TOM SAID HE RECKONED
THERE WAS ONE THING THEY HAD NOT TOLD HIM THAT THING WAS WHAT HE WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT NOW
HUCK'S FACE SADDENED
HE SAID
I KNOW WHAT IT IS
YOU GOT INTO NO
2 AND NEVER FOUND ANYTHING BUT
WHISKEY
NOBODY TOLD ME IT WAS YOU BUT I JUST KNOWED IT MUST 'A' BEN
YOU SOON AS I HEARD 'BOUT THAT WHISKEY BUSINESS AND I KNOWED YOU
HADN'T GOT THE MONEY BECUZ YOU'D 'A' GOT AT ME SOME WAY OR OTHER AND
TOLD ME EVEN IF YOU WAS MUM TO EVERYBODY ELSE
TOM SOMETHING'S ALWAYS
TOLD ME WE'D NEVER GET HOLT OF THAT SWAG
WHY HUCK I NEVER TOLD ON THAT TAVERN KEEPER
YOU KNOW HIS TAVERN
WAS ALL RIGHT THE SATURDAY I WENT TO THE PICNIC

FOLLERED INJUN JOE TO THE WIDDER'S

I RECKON INJUN JOE'S LEFT FRIENDS BEHIND HIM AND
I DON'T WANT 'EM SOURING ON ME AND DOING ME MEAN TRICKS
IF IT HADN'T
BEN FOR ME HE'D BE DOWN IN TEXAS NOW ALL RIGHT
THEN HUCK TOLD HIS ENTIRE ADVENTURE IN CONFIDENCE TO TOM WHO HAD ONLY
HEARD OF THE WELSHMAN'S PART OF IT BEFORE
WELL SAID HUCK PRESENTLY COMING BACK TO THE MAIN QUESTION WHOEVER
NIPPED THE WHISKEY IN NO
2 NIPPED THE MONEY TOO I RECKON ANYWAYS
IT'S A GONER FOR US TOM
HUCK THAT MONEY WASN'T EVER IN NO
2
WHAT HUCK SEARCHED HIS COMRADE'S FACE KEENLY
TOM HAVE YOU GOT ON
THE TRACK OF THAT MONEY AGAIN
HUCK IT'S IN THE CAVE
HUCK'S EYES BLAZED
SAY IT AGAIN TOM
THE MONEY'S IN THE CAVE
TOM HONEST INJUN NOW IS IT FUN OR EARNEST
EARNEST HUCK JUST AS EARNEST AS EVER I WAS IN MY LIFE
WILL YOU GO IN
THERE WITH ME AND HELP GET IT OUT
I BET I WILL I WILL IF IT'S WHERE WE CAN BLAZE OUR WAY TO IT AND NOT
GET LOST
HUCK WE CAN DO THAT WITHOUT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE IN THE
WORLD
GOOD AS WHEAT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THE MONEY'S
HUCK YOU JUST WAIT TILL WE GET IN THERE
IF WE DON'T FIND IT I'LL
AGREE TO GIVE YOU MY DRUM AND EVERY THING I'VE GOT IN THE WORLD
I WILL
BY JINGS
ALL RIGHT IT'S A WHIZ
WHEN DO YOU SAY
RIGHT NOW IF YOU SAY IT
ARE YOU STRONG ENOUGH
IS IT FAR IN THE CAVE I BEN ON MY PINS A LITTLE THREE OR FOUR DAYS
NOW BUT I CAN'T WALK MORE'N A MILE TOM LEAST I DON'T THINK I COULD
IT'S ABOUT FIVE MILE INTO THERE THE WAY ANYBODY BUT ME WOULD GO HUCK
BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY SHORT CUT THAT THEY DON'T ANYBODY BUT ME KNOW
ABOUT
HUCK I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT TO IT IN A SKIFF
I'LL FLOAT THE SKIFF
DOWN THERE AND I'LL PULL IT BACK AGAIN ALL BY MYSELF
YOU NEEDN'T EVER
TURN YOUR HAND OVER
LESS START RIGHT OFF TOM
ALL RIGHT
WE WANT SOME BREAD AND MEAT AND OUR PIPES AND A LITTLE
BAG OR TWO AND TWO OR THREE KITE STRINGS AND SOME OF THESE NEW FANGLED
THINGS THEY CALL LUCIFER MATCHES
I TELL YOU MANY'S THE TIME I WISHED I
HAD SOME WHEN I WAS IN THERE BEFORE
A TRIFLE AFTER NOON THE BOYS BORROWED A SMALL SKIFF FROM A CITIZEN WHO
WAS ABSENT AND GOT UNDER WAY AT ONCE
WHEN THEY WERE SEVERAL MILES
BELOW CAVE HOLLOW TOM SAID
NOW YOU SEE THIS BLUFF HERE LOOKS ALL ALIKE ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM THE
CAVE HOLLOW NO HOUSES NO WOOD YARDS BUSHES ALL ALIKE
BUT DO YOU SEE
THAT WHITE PLACE UP YONDER WHERE THERE'S BEEN A LANDSLIDE WELL THAT'S
ONE OF MY MARKS
WE'LL GET ASHORE NOW
THEY LANDED
NOW HUCK WHERE WE'RE A STANDING YOU COULD TOUCH THAT HOLE I GOT OUT
OF WITH A FISHING POLE
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND IT
HUCK SEARCHED ALL THE PLACE ABOUT AND FOUND NOTHING
TOM PROUDLY
MARCHED INTO A THICK CLUMP OF SUMACH BUSHES AND SAID
HERE YOU ARE LOOK AT IT HUCK IT'S THE SNUGGEST HOLE IN THIS COUNTRY
YOU JUST KEEP MUM ABOUT IT
ALL ALONG I'VE BEEN WANTING TO BE A ROBBER
BUT I KNEW I'D GOT TO HAVE A THING LIKE THIS AND WHERE TO RUN ACROSS
IT WAS THE BOTHER
WE'VE GOT IT NOW AND WE'LL KEEP IT QUIET ONLY WE'LL
LET JOE HARPER AND BEN ROGERS IN BECAUSE OF COURSE THERE'S GOT TO BE A
GANG OR ELSE THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY STYLE ABOUT IT
TOM SAWYER'S GANG IT
SOUNDS SPLENDID DON'T IT HUCK
WELL IT JUST DOES TOM
AND WHO'LL WE ROB
OH MOST ANYBODY
WAYLAY PEOPLE THAT'S MOSTLY THE WAY
AND KILL THEM
NO NOT ALWAYS
HIVE THEM IN THE CAVE TILL THEY RAISE A RANSOM
WHAT'S A RANSOM
MONEY
YOU MAKE THEM RAISE ALL THEY CAN OFF'N THEIR FRIENDS AND AFTER
YOU'VE KEPT THEM A YEAR IF IT AIN'T RAISED THEN YOU KILL THEM
THAT'S
THE GENERAL WAY
ONLY YOU DON'T KILL THE WOMEN
YOU SHUT UP THE WOMEN
BUT YOU DON'T KILL THEM
THEY'RE ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL AND RICH AND AWFULLY
SCARED
YOU TAKE THEIR WATCHES AND THINGS BUT YOU ALWAYS TAKE YOUR HAT
OFF AND TALK POLITE
THEY AIN'T ANYBODY AS POLITE AS ROBBERS YOU'LL SEE
THAT IN ANY BOOK
WELL THE WOMEN GET TO LOVING YOU AND AFTER THEY'VE
BEEN IN THE CAVE A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS THEY STOP CRYING AND AFTER THAT
YOU COULDN'T GET THEM TO LEAVE
IF YOU DROVE THEM OUT THEY'D TURN RIGHT
AROUND AND COME BACK
IT'S SO IN ALL THE BOOKS
WHY IT'S REAL BULLY TOM
I BELIEVE IT'S BETTER'N TO BE A PIRATE
YES IT'S BETTER IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE TO HOME AND CIRCUSES
AND ALL THAT
BY THIS TIME EVERYTHING WAS READY AND THE BOYS ENTERED THE HOLE TOM IN
THE LEAD
THEY TOILED THEIR WAY TO THE FARTHER END OF THE TUNNEL THEN
MADE THEIR SPLICED KITE STRINGS FAST AND MOVED ON
A FEW STEPS BROUGHT
THEM TO THE SPRING AND TOM FELT A SHUDDER QUIVER ALL THROUGH HIM
HE SHOWED HUCK THE FRAGMENT OF CANDLE WICK PERCHED ON A LUMP OF CLAY
AGAINST THE WALL AND DESCRIBED HOW HE AND BECKY HAD WATCHED THE FLAME
STRUGGLE AND EXPIRE
THE BOYS BEGAN TO QUIET DOWN TO WHISPERS NOW FOR THE STILLNESS AND
GLOOM OF THE PLACE OPPRESSED THEIR SPIRITS
THEY WENT ON AND PRESENTLY
ENTERED AND FOLLOWED TOM'S OTHER CORRIDOR UNTIL THEY REACHED THE
JUMPING OFF PLACE THE CANDLES REVEALED THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT
REALLY A PRECIPICE BUT ONLY A STEEP CLAY HILL TWENTY OR THIRTY FEET
HIGH
TOM WHISPERED
NOW I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING HUCK
HE HELD HIS CANDLE ALOFT AND SAID
LOOK AS FAR AROUND THE CORNER AS YOU CAN
DO YOU SEE THAT THERE ON THE
BIG ROCK OVER YONDER DONE WITH CANDLE SMOKE
TOM IT'S A CROSS
NOW WHERE'S YOUR NUMBER TWO UNDER THE CROSS HEY RIGHT YONDER'S
WHERE I SAW INJUN JOE POKE UP HIS CANDLE HUCK
HUCK STARED AT THE MYSTIC SIGN AWHILE AND THEN SAID WITH A SHAKY VOICE
TOM LESS GIT OUT OF HERE
WHAT AND LEAVE THE TREASURE
YES LEAVE IT
INJUN JOE'S GHOST IS ROUND ABOUT THERE CERTAIN
NO IT AIN'T HUCK NO IT AIN'T
IT WOULD HA'NT THE PLACE WHERE HE
DIED AWAY OUT AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE FIVE MILE FROM HERE
NO TOM IT WOULDN'T
IT WOULD HANG ROUND THE MONEY
I KNOW THE WAYS OF
GHOSTS AND SO DO YOU
TOM BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HUCK WAS RIGHT
MIS GIVINGS GATHERED IN HIS MIND
BUT PRESENTLY AN IDEA OCCURRED TO HIM
LOOKYHERE HUCK WHAT FOOLS WE'RE MAKING OF OURSELVES INJUN JOE'S
GHOST AIN'T A GOING TO COME AROUND WHERE THERE'S A CROSS
THE POINT WAS WELL TAKEN
IT HAD ITS EFFECT
TOM I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT
BUT THAT'S SO
IT'S LUCK FOR US THAT
CROSS IS
I RECKON WE'LL CLIMB DOWN THERE AND HAVE A HUNT FOR THAT BOX
TOM WENT FIRST CUTTING RUDE STEPS IN THE CLAY HILL AS HE DESCENDED
HUCK FOLLOWED
FOUR AVENUES OPENED OUT OF THE SMALL CAVERN WHICH THE
GREAT ROCK STOOD IN
THE BOYS EXAMINED THREE OF THEM WITH NO RESULT
THEY FOUND A SMALL RECESS IN THE ONE NEAREST THE BASE OF THE ROCK WITH
A PALLET OF BLANKETS SPREAD DOWN IN IT ALSO AN OLD SUSPENDER SOME
BACON RIND AND THE WELL GNAWED BONES OF TWO OR THREE FOWLS
BUT THERE
WAS NO MONEYBOX
THE LADS SEARCHED AND RESEARCHED THIS PLACE BUT IN
VAIN
TOM SAID
HE SAID UNDER THE CROSS
WELL THIS COMES NEAREST TO BEING UNDER THE
CROSS
IT CAN'T BE UNDER THE ROCK ITSELF BECAUSE THAT SETS SOLID ON THE
GROUND
THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE ONCE MORE AND THEN SAT DOWN DISCOURAGED
HUCK
COULD SUGGEST NOTHING
BY AND BY TOM SAID
LOOKYHERE HUCK THERE'S FOOTPRINTS AND SOME CANDLE GREASE ON THE CLAY
ABOUT ONE SIDE OF THIS ROCK BUT NOT ON THE OTHER SIDES
NOW WHAT'S
THAT FOR I BET YOU THE MONEY IS UNDER THE ROCK
I'M GOING TO DIG IN
THE CLAY
THAT AIN'T NO BAD NOTION TOM SAID HUCK WITH ANIMATION
TOM'S REAL BARLOW WAS OUT AT ONCE AND HE HAD NOT DUG FOUR INCHES
BEFORE HE STRUCK WOOD
HEY HUCK YOU HEAR THAT
HUCK BEGAN TO DIG AND SCRATCH NOW
SOME BOARDS WERE SOON UNCOVERED AND
REMOVED
THEY HAD CONCEALED A NATURAL CHASM WHICH LED UNDER THE ROCK
TOM GOT INTO THIS AND HELD HIS CANDLE AS FAR UNDER THE ROCK AS HE
COULD BUT SAID HE COULD NOT SEE TO THE END OF THE RIFT
HE PROPOSED
TO EXPLORE
HE STOOPED AND PASSED UNDER THE NARROW WAY DESCENDED
GRADUALLY
HE FOLLOWED ITS WINDING COURSE FIRST TO THE RIGHT THEN TO
THE LEFT HUCK AT HIS HEELS
TOM TURNED A SHORT CURVE BY AND BY AND
EXCLAIMED
MY GOODNESS HUCK LOOKYHERE
IT WAS THE TREASURE BOX SURE ENOUGH OCCUPYING A SNUG LITTLE CAVERN
ALONG WITH AN EMPTY POWDER KEG A COUPLE OF GUNS IN LEATHER CASES TWO
OR THREE PAIRS OF OLD MOCCASINS A LEATHER BELT AND SOME OTHER RUBBISH
WELL SOAKED WITH THE WATER DRIP
GOT IT AT LAST SAID HUCK PLOUGHING AMONG THE TARNISHED COINS WITH
HIS HAND
MY BUT WE'RE RICH TOM
HUCK I ALWAYS RECKONED WE'D GET IT
IT'S JUST TOO GOOD TO BELIEVE BUT
WE HAVE GOT IT SURE SAY LET'S NOT FOOL AROUND HERE
LET'S SNAKE IT
OUT
LEMME SEE IF I CAN LIFT THE BOX
IT WEIGHED ABOUT FIFTY POUNDS
TOM COULD LIFT IT AFTER AN AWKWARD
FASHION BUT COULD NOT CARRY IT CONVENIENTLY
I THOUGHT SO HE SAID THEY CARRIED IT LIKE IT WAS HEAVY THAT DAY
AT THE HA'NTED HOUSE
I NOTICED THAT
I RECKON I WAS RIGHT TO THINK OF
FETCHING THE LITTLE BAGS ALONG
THE MONEY WAS SOON IN THE BAGS AND THE BOYS TOOK IT UP TO THE CROSS
ROCK
NOW LESS FETCH THE GUNS AND THINGS SAID HUCK
NO HUCK LEAVE THEM THERE
THEY'RE JUST THE TRICKS TO HAVE WHEN WE
GO TO ROBBING
WE'LL KEEP THEM THERE ALL THE TIME AND WE'LL HOLD OUR
ORGIES THERE TOO
IT'S AN AWFUL SNUG PLACE FOR ORGIES
WHAT ORGIES
I DONO
BUT ROBBERS ALWAYS HAVE ORGIES AND OF COURSE WE'VE GOT TO
HAVE THEM TOO
COME ALONG HUCK WE'VE BEEN IN HERE A LONG TIME
IT'S
GETTING LATE I RECKON
I'M HUNGRY TOO
WE'LL EAT AND SMOKE WHEN WE GET
TO THE SKIFF
THEY PRESENTLY EMERGED INTO THE CLUMP OF SUMACH BUSHES LOOKED WARILY
OUT FOUND THE COAST CLEAR AND WERE SOON LUNCHING AND SMOKING IN THE
SKIFF
AS THE SUN DIPPED TOWARD THE HORIZON THEY PUSHED OUT AND GOT
UNDER WAY
TOM SKIMMED UP THE SHORE THROUGH THE LONG TWILIGHT CHATTING
CHEERILY WITH HUCK AND LANDED SHORTLY AFTER DARK
NOW HUCK SAID TOM WE'LL HIDE THE MONEY IN THE LOFT OF THE WIDOW'S
WOODSHED AND I'LL COME UP IN THE MORNING AND WE'LL COUNT IT AND DIVIDE
AND THEN WE'LL HUNT UP A PLACE OUT IN THE WOODS FOR IT WHERE IT WILL BE
SAFE
JUST YOU LAY QUIET HERE AND WATCH THE STUFF TILL I RUN AND HOOK
BENNY TAYLOR'S LITTLE WAGON I WON'T BE GONE A MINUTE
HE DISAPPEARED AND PRESENTLY RETURNED WITH THE WAGON PUT THE TWO SMALL
SACKS INTO IT THREW SOME OLD RAGS ON TOP OF THEM AND STARTED OFF
DRAGGING HIS CARGO BEHIND HIM
WHEN THE BOYS REACHED THE WELSHMAN'S
HOUSE THEY STOPPED TO REST
JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON THE
WELSHMAN STEPPED OUT AND SAID
HALLO WHO'S THAT
HUCK AND TOM SAWYER
GOOD COME ALONG WITH ME BOYS YOU ARE KEEPING EVERYBODY WAITING
HERE HURRY UP TROT AHEAD I'LL HAUL THE WAGON FOR YOU
WHY IT'S NOT AS
LIGHT AS IT MIGHT BE
GOT BRICKS IN IT OR OLD METAL
OLD METAL SAID TOM
I JUDGED SO THE BOYS IN THIS TOWN WILL TAKE MORE TROUBLE AND FOOL AWAY
MORE TIME HUNTING UP SIX BITS' WORTH OF OLD IRON TO SELL TO THE FOUNDRY
THAN THEY WOULD TO MAKE TWICE THE MONEY AT REGULAR WORK
BUT THAT'S
HUMAN NATURE HURRY ALONG HURRY ALONG
THE BOYS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE HURRY WAS ABOUT
NEVER MIND YOU'LL SEE WHEN WE GET TO THE WIDOW DOUGLAS'
HUCK SAID WITH SOME APPREHENSION FOR HE WAS LONG USED TO BEING FALSELY
ACCUSED
MR
JONES WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING NOTHING
THE WELSHMAN LAUGHED
WELL I DON'T KNOW HUCK MY BOY
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
AIN'T YOU
AND THE WIDOW GOOD FRIENDS
YES
WELL SHE'S BEN GOOD FRIENDS TO ME ANYWAY
ALL RIGHT THEN
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE AFRAID FOR
THIS QUESTION WAS NOT ENTIRELY ANSWERED IN HUCK'S SLOW MIND BEFORE HE
FOUND HIMSELF PUSHED ALONG WITH TOM INTO MRS
DOUGLAS' DRAWING ROOM
MR
JONES LEFT THE WAGON NEAR THE DOOR AND FOLLOWED
THE PLACE WAS GRANDLY LIGHTED AND EVERYBODY THAT WAS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE
IN THE VILLAGE WAS THERE
THE THATCHERS WERE THERE THE HARPERS THE
ROGERSES AUNT POLLY SID MARY THE MINISTER THE EDITOR AND A GREAT
MANY MORE AND ALL DRESSED IN THEIR BEST
THE WIDOW RECEIVED THE BOYS
AS HEARTILY AS ANY ONE COULD WELL RECEIVE TWO SUCH LOOKING BEINGS
THEY
WERE COVERED WITH CLAY AND CANDLE GREASE
AUNT POLLY BLUSHED CRIMSON
WITH HUMILIATION AND FROWNED AND SHOOK HER HEAD AT TOM
NOBODY SUFFERED
HALF AS MUCH AS THE TWO BOYS DID HOWEVER
MR
JONES SAID
TOM WASN'T AT HOME YET SO I GAVE HIM UP BUT I STUMBLED ON HIM AND
HUCK RIGHT AT MY DOOR AND SO I JUST BROUGHT THEM ALONG IN A HURRY
AND YOU DID JUST RIGHT SAID THE WIDOW
COME WITH ME BOYS
SHE TOOK THEM TO A BEDCHAMBER AND SAID
NOW WASH AND DRESS YOURSELVES
HERE ARE TWO NEW SUITS OF
CLOTHES SHIRTS SOCKS EVERYTHING COMPLETE
THEY'RE HUCK'S NO NO
THANKS HUCK MR
JONES BOUGHT ONE AND I THE OTHER
BUT THEY'LL FIT BOTH
OF YOU
GET INTO THEM
WE'LL WAIT COME DOWN WHEN YOU ARE SLICKED UP
ENOUGH
THEN SHE LEFT
CHAPTER XXXIV
HUCK SAID TOM WE CAN SLOPE IF WE CAN FIND A ROPE
THE WINDOW AIN'T
HIGH FROM THE GROUND
SHUCKS WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SLOPE FOR
WELL I AIN'T USED TO THAT KIND OF A CROWD
I CAN'T STAND IT
I AIN'T
GOING DOWN THERE TOM
OH BOTHER IT AIN'T ANYTHING
I DON'T MIND IT A BIT
I'LL TAKE CARE OF
YOU
SID APPEARED
TOM SAID HE AUNTIE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ALL THE AFTERNOON
MARY
GOT YOUR SUNDAY CLOTHES READY AND EVERYBODY'S BEEN FRETTING ABOUT YOU
SAY AIN'T THIS GREASE AND CLAY ON YOUR CLOTHES
NOW MR
SIDDY YOU JIST 'TEND TO YOUR OWN BUSINESS
WHAT'S ALL THIS
BLOWOUT ABOUT ANYWAY
IT'S ONE OF THE WIDOW'S PARTIES THAT SHE'S ALWAYS HAVING
THIS TIME
IT'S FOR THE WELSHMAN AND HIS SONS ON ACCOUNT OF THAT SCRAPE THEY
HELPED HER OUT OF THE OTHER NIGHT
AND SAY I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING IF
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WELL WHAT
WHY OLD MR
JONES IS GOING TO TRY TO SPRING SOMETHING ON THE PEOPLE
HERE TONIGHT BUT I OVERHEARD HIM TELL AUNTIE TODAY ABOUT IT AS A
SECRET BUT I RECKON IT'S NOT MUCH OF A SECRET NOW
EVERYBODY KNOWS THE
WIDOW TOO FOR ALL SHE TRIES TO LET ON SHE DON'T
MR
JONES WAS BOUND
HUCK SHOULD BE HERE COULDN'T GET ALONG WITH HIS GRAND SECRET WITHOUT
HUCK YOU KNOW
SECRET ABOUT WHAT SID
ABOUT HUCK TRACKING THE ROBBERS TO THE WIDOW'S
I RECKON MR
JONES WAS
GOING TO MAKE A GRAND TIME OVER HIS SURPRISE BUT I BET YOU IT WILL DROP
PRETTY FLAT
SID CHUCKLED IN A VERY CONTENTED AND SATISFIED WAY
SID WAS IT YOU THAT TOLD
OH NEVER MIND WHO IT WAS
SOMEBODY TOLD THAT'S ENOUGH
SID THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON IN THIS TOWN MEAN ENOUGH TO DO THAT AND
THAT'S YOU
IF YOU HAD BEEN IN HUCK'S PLACE YOU'D 'A' SNEAKED DOWN THE
HILL AND NEVER TOLD ANYBODY ON THE ROBBERS
YOU CAN'T DO ANY BUT MEAN
THINGS AND YOU CAN'T BEAR TO SEE ANYBODY PRAISED FOR DOING GOOD ONES
THERE NO THANKS AS THE WIDOW SAYS AND TOM CUFFED SID'S EARS AND HELPED
HIM TO THE DOOR WITH SEVERAL KICKS
NOW GO AND TELL AUNTIE IF YOU
DARE AND TOMORROW YOU'LL CATCH IT
SOME MINUTES LATER THE WIDOW'S GUESTS WERE AT THE SUPPER TABLE AND A
DOZEN CHILDREN WERE PROPPED UP AT LITTLE SIDE TABLES IN THE SAME ROOM
AFTER THE FASHION OF THAT COUNTRY AND THAT DAY
AT THE PROPER TIME MR
JONES MADE HIS LITTLE SPEECH IN WHICH HE THANKED THE WIDOW FOR THE
HONOR SHE WAS DOING HIMSELF AND HIS SONS BUT SAID THAT THERE WAS
ANOTHER PERSON WHOSE MODESTY
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON
HE SPRUNG HIS SECRET ABOUT HUCK'S SHARE IN
THE ADVENTURE IN THE FINEST DRAMATIC MANNER HE WAS MASTER OF BUT THE
SURPRISE IT OCCASIONED WAS LARGELY COUNTERFEIT AND NOT AS CLAMOROUS AND
EFFUSIVE AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNDER HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES
HOWEVER
THE WIDOW MADE A PRETTY FAIR SHOW OF ASTONISHMENT AND HEAPED SO MANY
COMPLIMENTS AND SO MUCH GRATITUDE UPON HUCK THAT HE ALMOST FORGOT
THE NEARLY INTOLERABLE DISCOMFORT OF HIS NEW CLOTHES IN THE ENTIRELY
INTOLERABLE DISCOMFORT OF BEING SET UP AS A TARGET FOR EVERYBODY'S GAZE
AND EVERYBODY'S LAUDATIONS
THE WIDOW SAID SHE MEANT TO GIVE HUCK A HOME UNDER HER ROOF AND HAVE HIM
EDUCATED AND THAT WHEN SHE COULD SPARE THE MONEY SHE WOULD START HIM IN
BUSINESS IN A MODEST WAY
TOM'S CHANCE WAS COME
HE SAID
HUCK DON'T NEED IT
HUCK'S RICH
NOTHING BUT A HEAVY STRAIN UPON THE GOOD MANNERS OF THE COMPANY KEPT
BACK THE DUE AND PROPER COMPLIMENTARY LAUGH AT THIS PLEASANT JOKE
BUT
THE SILENCE WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD
TOM BROKE IT
HUCK'S GOT MONEY
MAYBE YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT BUT HE'S GOT LOTS OF IT
OH YOU NEEDN'T SMILE I RECKON I CAN SHOW YOU
YOU JUST WAIT A MINUTE
TOM RAN OUT OF DOORS
THE COMPANY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITH A PERPLEXED
INTEREST AND INQUIRINGLY AT HUCK WHO WAS TONGUE TIED
SID WHAT AILS TOM SAID AUNT POLLY
HE WELL THERE AIN'T EVER ANY
MAKING OF THAT BOY OUT
I NEVER
TOM ENTERED STRUGGLING WITH THE WEIGHT OF HIS SACKS AND AUNT POLLY
DID NOT FINISH HER SENTENCE
TOM POURED THE MASS OF YELLOW COIN UPON THE
TABLE AND SAID
THERE WHAT DID I TELL YOU HALF OF IT'S HUCK'S AND HALF OF IT'S MINE
THE SPECTACLE TOOK THE GENERAL BREATH AWAY
ALL GAZED NOBODY SPOKE FOR
A MOMENT
THEN THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS CALL FOR AN EXPLANATION
TOM SAID
HE COULD FURNISH IT AND HE DID
THE TALE WAS LONG BUT BRIMFUL OF
INTEREST
THERE WAS SCARCELY AN INTERRUPTION FROM ANY ONE TO BREAK THE
CHARM OF ITS FLOW
WHEN HE HAD FINISHED MR
JONES SAID
I THOUGHT I HAD FIXED UP A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR THIS OCCASION BUT IT
DON'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING NOW
THIS ONE MAKES IT SING MIGHTY SMALL I'M
WILLING TO ALLOW
THE MONEY WAS COUNTED
THE SUM AMOUNTED TO A LITTLE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND
DOLLARS
IT WAS MORE THAN ANY ONE PRESENT HAD EVER SEEN AT ONE TIME
BEFORE THOUGH SEVERAL PERSONS WERE THERE WHO WERE WORTH CONSIDERABLY
MORE THAN THAT IN PROPERTY
CHAPTER XXXV
THE READER MAY REST SATISFIED THAT TOM'S AND HUCK'S WINDFALL MADE A
MIGHTY STIR IN THE POOR LITTLE VILLAGE OF ST
PETERSBURG
SO VAST A
SUM ALL IN ACTUAL CASH SEEMED NEXT TO INCREDIBLE
IT WAS TALKED
ABOUT GLOATED OVER GLORIFIED UNTIL THE REASON OF MANY OF THE CITIZENS
TOTTERED UNDER THE STRAIN OF THE UNHEALTHY EXCITEMENT
EVERY HAUNTED
HOUSE IN ST
PETERSBURG AND THE NEIGHBORING VILLAGES WAS DISSECTED
PLANK BY PLANK AND ITS FOUNDATIONS DUG UP AND RANSACKED FOR HIDDEN
TREASURE AND NOT BY BOYS BUT MEN PRETTY GRAVE UNROMANTIC MEN TOO
SOME OF THEM
WHEREVER TOM AND HUCK APPEARED THEY WERE COURTED ADMIRED
STARED AT
THE BOYS WERE NOT ABLE TO REMEMBER THAT THEIR REMARKS HAD
POSSESSED WEIGHT BEFORE BUT NOW THEIR SAYINGS WERE TREASURED AND
REPEATED EVERYTHING THEY DID SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE REGARDED AS
REMARKABLE THEY HAD EVIDENTLY LOST THE POWER OF DOING AND SAYING
COMMONPLACE THINGS MOREOVER THEIR PAST HISTORY WAS RAKED UP AND
DISCOVERED TO BEAR MARKS OF CONSPICUOUS ORIGINALITY
THE VILLAGE PAPER
PUBLISHED BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF THE BOYS
THE WIDOW DOUGLAS PUT HUCK'S MONEY OUT AT SIX PER CENT AND JUDGE
THATCHER DID THE SAME WITH TOM'S AT AUNT POLLY'S REQUEST
EACH LAD HAD
AN INCOME NOW THAT WAS SIMPLY PRODIGIOUS A DOLLAR FOR EVERY WEEKDAY IN
THE YEAR AND HALF OF THE SUNDAYS
IT WAS JUST WHAT THE MINISTER GOT NO
IT WAS WHAT HE WAS PROMISED HE GENERALLY COULDN'T COLLECT IT
A DOLLAR
AND A QUARTER A WEEK WOULD BOARD LODGE AND SCHOOL A BOY IN THOSE OLD
SIMPLE DAYS AND CLOTHE HIM AND WASH HIM TOO FOR THAT MATTER
JUDGE THATCHER HAD CONCEIVED A GREAT OPINION OF TOM
HE SAID THAT NO
COMMONPLACE BOY WOULD EVER HAVE GOT HIS DAUGHTER OUT OF THE CAVE
WHEN
BECKY TOLD HER FATHER IN STRICT CONFIDENCE HOW TOM HAD TAKEN HER
WHIPPING AT SCHOOL THE JUDGE WAS VISIBLY MOVED AND WHEN SHE PLEADED
GRACE FOR THE MIGHTY LIE WHICH TOM HAD TOLD IN ORDER TO SHIFT THAT
WHIPPING FROM HER SHOULDERS TO HIS OWN THE JUDGE SAID WITH A FINE
OUTBURST THAT IT WAS A NOBLE A GENEROUS A MAGNANIMOUS LIE A LIE THAT
WAS WORTHY TO HOLD UP ITS HEAD AND MARCH DOWN THROUGH HISTORY BREAST TO
BREAST WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON'S LAUDED TRUTH ABOUT THE HATCHET BECKY
THOUGHT HER FATHER HAD NEVER LOOKED SO TALL AND SO SUPERB AS WHEN HE
WALKED THE FLOOR AND STAMPED HIS FOOT AND SAID THAT
SHE WENT STRAIGHT
OFF AND TOLD TOM ABOUT IT
JUDGE THATCHER HOPED TO SEE TOM A GREAT LAWYER OR A GREAT SOLDIER SOME
DAY
HE SAID HE MEANT TO LOOK TO IT THAT TOM SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THE
NATIONAL MILITARY ACADEMY AND AFTERWARD TRAINED IN THE BEST LAW SCHOOL
IN THE COUNTRY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE READY FOR EITHER CAREER OR
BOTH
HUCK FINN'S WEALTH AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS NOW UNDER THE WIDOW DOUGLAS'
PROTECTION INTRODUCED HIM INTO SOCIETY NO DRAGGED HIM INTO IT HURLED
HIM INTO IT AND HIS SUFFERINGS WERE ALMOST MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR
THE
WIDOW'S SERVANTS KEPT HIM CLEAN AND NEAT COMBED AND BRUSHED AND THEY
BEDDED HIM NIGHTLY IN UNSYMPATHETIC SHEETS THAT HAD NOT ONE LITTLE SPOT
OR STAIN WHICH HE COULD PRESS TO HIS HEART AND KNOW FOR A FRIEND
HE HAD
TO EAT WITH A KNIFE AND FORK HE HAD TO USE NAPKIN CUP AND PLATE
HE HAD TO LEARN HIS BOOK HE HAD TO GO TO CHURCH HE HAD TO TALK SO
PROPERLY THAT SPEECH WAS BECOME INSIPID IN HIS MOUTH WHITHERSOEVER HE
TURNED THE BARS AND SHACKLES OF CIVILIZATION SHUT HIM IN AND BOUND HIM
HAND AND FOOT
HE BRAVELY BORE HIS MISERIES THREE WEEKS AND THEN ONE DAY TURNED UP
MISSING
FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE WIDOW HUNTED FOR HIM EVERYWHERE IN
GREAT DISTRESS
THE PUBLIC WERE PROFOUNDLY CONCERNED THEY SEARCHED HIGH
AND LOW THEY DRAGGED THE RIVER FOR HIS BODY
EARLY THE THIRD MORNING
TOM SAWYER WISELY WENT POKING AMONG SOME OLD EMPTY HOGSHEADS DOWN BEHIND
THE ABANDONED SLAUGHTER HOUSE AND IN ONE OF THEM HE FOUND THE REFUGEE
HUCK HAD SLEPT THERE HE HAD JUST BREAKFASTED UPON SOME STOLEN ODDS AND
ENDS OF FOOD AND WAS LYING OFF NOW IN COMFORT WITH HIS PIPE
HE WAS
UNKEMPT UNCOMBED AND CLAD IN THE SAME OLD RUIN OF RAGS THAT HAD MADE
HIM PICTURESQUE IN THE DAYS WHEN HE WAS FREE AND HAPPY
TOM ROUTED HIM
OUT TOLD HIM THE TROUBLE HE HAD BEEN CAUSING AND URGED HIM TO GO HOME
HUCK'S FACE LOST ITS TRANQUIL CONTENT AND TOOK A MELANCHOLY CAST
HE
SAID
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT TOM
I'VE TRIED IT AND IT DON'T WORK IT DON'T
WORK TOM
IT AIN'T FOR ME I AIN'T USED TO IT
THE WIDDER'S GOOD TO ME
AND FRIENDLY BUT I CAN'T STAND THEM WAYS

HUCK'S JOY WAS QUENCHED
CAN'T LET ME IN TOM DIDN'T YOU LET ME GO FOR A PIRATE

PIRATE IS AS A GENERAL THING
IN MOST COUNTRIES THEY'RE AWFUL HIGH UP IN
THE NOBILITY DUKES AND SUCH
NOW TOM HAIN'T YOU ALWAYS BEN FRIENDLY TO ME YOU WOULDN'T SHET ME

A REG'LAR RIPPER OF A ROBBER AND EVERYBODY TALKING 'BOUT IT I RECKON
SHE'LL BE PROUD SHE SNAKED ME IN OUT OF THE WET
CONCLUSION
SO ENDETH THIS CHRONICLE
IT BEING STRICTLY A HISTORY OF A BOY IT
MUST STOP HERE THE STORY COULD NOT GO MUCH FURTHER WITHOUT BECOMING THE
HISTORY OF A MAN
WHEN ONE WRITES A NOVEL ABOUT GROWN PEOPLE HE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHERE TO STOP THAT IS WITH A MARRIAGE BUT WHEN HE WRITES OF
JUVENILES HE MUST STOP WHERE HE BEST CAN
MOST OF THE CHARACTERS THAT PERFORM IN THIS BOOK STILL LIVE AND ARE
PROSPEROUS AND HAPPY
SOME DAY IT MAY SEEM WORTH WHILE TO TAKE UP THE
STORY OF THE YOUNGER ONES AGAIN AND SEE WHAT SORT OF MEN AND WOMEN THEY
TURNED OUT TO BE THEREFORE IT WILL BE WISEST NOT TO REVEAL ANY OF THAT
PART OF THEIR LIVES AT PRESENT

THE AUTHOR
HUCKLEBERRY FINN
SCENE THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TIME FORTY TO FIFTY YEARS AGO
CHAPTER I
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME WITHOUT YOU HAVE READ A BOOK BY THE NAME OF THE
ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER BUT THAT AIN'T NO MATTER
THAT BOOK WAS MADE
BY MR
MARK TWAIN AND HE TOLD THE TRUTH MAINLY
THERE WAS THINGS
WHICH HE STRETCHED BUT MAINLY HE TOLD THE TRUTH
THAT IS NOTHING
I
NEVER SEEN ANYBODY BUT LIED ONE TIME OR ANOTHER WITHOUT IT WAS AUNT
POLLY OR THE WIDOW OR MAYBE MARY
AUNT POLLY TOM'S AUNT POLLY SHE
IS AND MARY AND THE WIDOW DOUGLAS IS ALL TOLD ABOUT IN THAT BOOK WHICH
IS MOSTLY A TRUE BOOK WITH SOME STRETCHERS AS I SAID BEFORE
NOW THE WAY THAT THE BOOK WINDS UP IS THIS TOM AND ME FOUND THE MONEY
THAT THE ROBBERS HID IN THE CAVE AND IT MADE US RICH
WE GOT SIX
THOUSAND DOLLARS APIECE ALL GOLD
IT WAS AN AWFUL SIGHT OF MONEY WHEN
IT WAS PILED UP
WELL JUDGE THATCHER HE TOOK IT AND PUT IT OUT
AT INTEREST AND IT FETCHED US A DOLLAR A DAY APIECE ALL THE YEAR
ROUND MORE THAN A BODY COULD TELL WHAT TO DO WITH
THE WIDOW DOUGLAS
SHE TOOK ME FOR HER SON AND ALLOWED SHE WOULD SIVILIZE ME BUT IT WAS
ROUGH LIVING IN THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME CONSIDERING HOW DISMAL REGULAR
AND DECENT THE WIDOW WAS IN ALL HER WAYS AND SO WHEN I COULDN'T STAND
IT NO LONGER I LIT OUT
I GOT INTO MY OLD RAGS AND MY SUGAR HOGSHEAD
AGAIN AND WAS FREE AND SATISFIED
BUT TOM SAWYER HE HUNTED ME UP AND
SAID HE WAS GOING TO START A BAND OF ROBBERS AND I MIGHT JOIN IF I
WOULD GO BACK TO THE WIDOW AND BE RESPECTABLE
SO I WENT BACK
THE WIDOW SHE CRIED OVER ME AND CALLED ME A POOR LOST LAMB AND SHE
CALLED ME A LOT OF OTHER NAMES TOO BUT SHE NEVER MEANT NO HARM BY
IT
SHE PUT ME IN THEM NEW CLOTHES AGAIN AND I COULDN'T DO NOTHING BUT
SWEAT AND SWEAT AND FEEL ALL CRAMPED UP
WELL THEN THE OLD THING
COMMENCED AGAIN
THE WIDOW RUNG A BELL FOR SUPPER AND YOU HAD TO COME
TO TIME
WHEN YOU GOT TO THE TABLE YOU COULDN'T GO RIGHT TO EATING BUT
YOU HAD TO WAIT FOR THE WIDOW TO TUCK DOWN HER HEAD AND GRUMBLE A LITTLE
OVER THE VICTUALS THOUGH THERE WARN'T REALLY ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH
THEM THAT IS NOTHING ONLY EVERYTHING WAS COOKED BY ITSELF
IN A
BARREL OF ODDS AND ENDS IT IS DIFFERENT THINGS GET MIXED UP AND THE
JUICE KIND OF SWAPS AROUND AND THE THINGS GO BETTER
AFTER SUPPER SHE GOT OUT HER BOOK AND LEARNED ME ABOUT MOSES AND THE
BULRUSHERS AND I WAS IN A SWEAT TO FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HIM BUT BY AND
BY SHE LET IT OUT THAT MOSES HAD BEEN DEAD A CONSIDERABLE LONG TIME SO
THEN I DIDN'T CARE NO MORE ABOUT HIM BECAUSE I DON'T TAKE NO STOCK IN
DEAD PEOPLE
PRETTY SOON I WANTED TO SMOKE AND ASKED THE WIDOW TO LET ME
BUT SHE
WOULDN'T
SHE SAID IT WAS A MEAN PRACTICE AND WASN'T CLEAN AND I MUST
TRY TO NOT DO IT ANY MORE
THAT IS JUST THE WAY WITH SOME PEOPLE
THEY
GET DOWN ON A THING WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
HERE SHE WAS
A BOTHERING ABOUT MOSES WHICH WAS NO KIN TO HER AND NO USE TO ANYBODY
BEING GONE YOU SEE YET FINDING A POWER OF FAULT WITH ME FOR DOING A
THING THAT HAD SOME GOOD IN IT
AND SHE TOOK SNUFF TOO OF COURSE THAT
WAS ALL RIGHT BECAUSE SHE DONE IT HERSELF
HER SISTER MISS WATSON A TOLERABLE SLIM OLD MAID WITH GOGGLES ON
HAD JUST COME TO LIVE WITH HER AND TOOK A SET AT ME NOW WITH A
SPELLING BOOK
SHE WORKED ME MIDDLING HARD FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN
THE WIDOW MADE HER EASE UP
I COULDN'T STOOD IT MUCH LONGER
THEN FOR
AN HOUR IT WAS DEADLY DULL AND I WAS FIDGETY
MISS WATSON WOULD SAY
DON'T PUT YOUR FEET UP THERE HUCKLEBERRY AND DON'T SCRUNCH UP
LIKE THAT HUCKLEBERRY SET UP STRAIGHT AND PRETTY SOON SHE WOULD
SAY DON'T GAP AND STRETCH LIKE THAT HUCKLEBERRY WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO
BEHAVE THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE BAD PLACE AND I SAID I WISHED
I WAS THERE
SHE GOT MAD THEN BUT I DIDN'T MEAN NO HARM
ALL I WANTED
WAS TO GO SOMEWHERES ALL I WANTED WAS A CHANGE I WARN'T PARTICULAR
SHE SAID IT WAS WICKED TO SAY WHAT I SAID SAID SHE WOULDN'T SAY IT FOR
THE WHOLE WORLD SHE WAS GOING TO LIVE SO AS TO GO TO THE GOOD PLACE
WELL I COULDN'T SEE NO ADVANTAGE IN GOING WHERE SHE WAS GOING SO I
MADE UP MY MIND I WOULDN'T TRY FOR IT
BUT I NEVER SAID SO BECAUSE IT
WOULD ONLY MAKE TROUBLE AND WOULDN'T DO NO GOOD
NOW SHE HAD GOT A START AND SHE WENT ON AND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT THE GOOD
PLACE
SHE SAID ALL A BODY WOULD HAVE TO DO THERE WAS TO GO AROUND ALL
DAY LONG WITH A HARP AND SING FOREVER AND EVER
SO I DIDN'T THINK
MUCH OF IT
BUT I NEVER SAID SO
I ASKED HER IF SHE RECKONED TOM SAWYER
WOULD GO THERE AND SHE SAID NOT BY A CONSIDERABLE SIGHT
I WAS GLAD
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I WANTED HIM AND ME TO BE TOGETHER
MISS WATSON SHE KEPT PECKING AT ME AND IT GOT TIRESOME AND LONESOME
BY AND BY THEY FETCHED THE NIGGERS IN AND HAD PRAYERS AND THEN
EVERYBODY WAS OFF TO BED
I WENT UP TO MY ROOM WITH A PIECE OF CANDLE
AND PUT IT ON THE TABLE
THEN I SET DOWN IN A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW AND
TRIED TO THINK OF SOMETHING CHEERFUL BUT IT WARN'T NO USE
I FELT
SO LONESOME I MOST WISHED I WAS DEAD
THE STARS WERE SHINING AND THE
LEAVES RUSTLED IN THE WOODS EVER SO MOURNFUL AND I HEARD AN OWL AWAY
OFF WHO WHOOING ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT WAS DEAD AND A WHIPPOWILL AND A
DOG CRYING ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT WAS GOING TO DIE AND THE WIND WAS TRYING
TO WHISPER SOMETHING TO ME AND I COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS AND SO
IT MADE THE COLD SHIVERS RUN OVER ME
THEN AWAY OUT IN THE WOODS I HEARD
THAT KIND OF A SOUND THAT A GHOST MAKES WHEN IT WANTS TO TELL ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT'S ON ITS MIND AND CAN'T MAKE ITSELF UNDERSTOOD AND SO
CAN'T REST EASY IN ITS GRAVE AND HAS TO GO ABOUT THAT WAY EVERY NIGHT
GRIEVING
I GOT SO DOWN HEARTED AND SCARED I DID WISH I HAD SOME
COMPANY
PRETTY SOON A SPIDER WENT CRAWLING UP MY SHOULDER AND I
FLIPPED IT OFF AND IT LIT IN THE CANDLE AND BEFORE I COULD BUDGE IT
WAS ALL SHRIVELED UP
I DIDN'T NEED ANYBODY TO TELL ME THAT THAT WAS
AN AWFUL BAD SIGN AND WOULD FETCH ME SOME BAD LUCK SO I WAS SCARED
AND MOST SHOOK THE CLOTHES OFF OF ME
I GOT UP AND TURNED AROUND IN MY
TRACKS THREE TIMES AND CROSSED MY BREAST EVERY TIME AND THEN I TIED
UP A LITTLE LOCK OF MY HAIR WITH A THREAD TO KEEP WITCHES AWAY
BUT
I HADN'T NO CONFIDENCE
YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU'VE LOST A HORSESHOE THAT
YOU'VE FOUND INSTEAD OF NAILING IT UP OVER THE DOOR BUT I HADN'T EVER
HEARD ANYBODY SAY IT WAS ANY WAY TO KEEP OFF BAD LUCK WHEN YOU'D KILLED
A SPIDER
I SET DOWN AGAIN A SHAKING ALL OVER AND GOT OUT MY PIPE FOR A SMOKE
FOR THE HOUSE WAS ALL AS STILL AS DEATH NOW AND SO THE WIDOW WOULDN'T
KNOW
WELL AFTER A LONG TIME I HEARD THE CLOCK AWAY OFF IN THE TOWN
GO BOOM BOOM BOOM TWELVE LICKS AND ALL STILL AGAIN STILLER THAN
EVER
PRETTY SOON I HEARD A TWIG SNAP DOWN IN THE DARK AMONGST THE
TREES SOMETHING WAS A STIRRING
I SET STILL AND LISTENED
DIRECTLY I
COULD JUST BARELY HEAR A ME YOW ME YOW DOWN THERE
THAT WAS GOOD
SAYS I ME YOW ME YOW AS SOFT AS I COULD AND THEN I PUT OUT THE
LIGHT AND SCRAMBLED OUT OF THE WINDOW ON TO THE SHED
THEN I SLIPPED
DOWN TO THE GROUND AND CRAWLED IN AMONG THE TREES AND SURE ENOUGH
THERE WAS TOM SAWYER WAITING FOR ME
CHAPTER II
WE WENT TIPTOEING ALONG A PATH AMONGST THE TREES BACK TOWARDS THE END OF
THE WIDOW'S GARDEN STOOPING DOWN SO AS THE BRANCHES WOULDN'T SCRAPE OUR
HEADS
WHEN WE WAS PASSING BY THE KITCHEN I FELL OVER A ROOT AND MADE
A NOISE
WE SCROUCHED DOWN AND LAID STILL
MISS WATSON'S BIG NIGGER
NAMED JIM WAS SETTING IN THE KITCHEN DOOR WE COULD SEE HIM PRETTY
CLEAR BECAUSE THERE WAS A LIGHT BEHIND HIM
HE GOT UP AND STRETCHED
HIS NECK OUT ABOUT A MINUTE LISTENING
THEN HE SAYS
WHO DAH
HE LISTENED SOME MORE THEN HE COME TIPTOEING DOWN AND STOOD RIGHT
BETWEEN US WE COULD A TOUCHED HIM NEARLY
WELL LIKELY IT WAS
MINUTES AND MINUTES THAT THERE WARN'T A SOUND AND WE ALL THERE SO CLOSE
TOGETHER
THERE WAS A PLACE ON MY ANKLE THAT GOT TO ITCHING BUT I
DASN'T SCRATCH IT AND THEN MY EAR BEGUN TO ITCH AND NEXT MY BACK
RIGHT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS
SEEMED LIKE I'D DIE IF I COULDN'T SCRATCH
WELL I'VE NOTICED THAT THING PLENTY TIMES SINCE
IF YOU ARE WITH
THE QUALITY OR AT A FUNERAL OR TRYING TO GO TO SLEEP WHEN YOU AIN'T
SLEEPY IF YOU ARE ANYWHERES WHERE IT WON'T DO FOR YOU TO SCRATCH WHY
YOU WILL ITCH ALL OVER IN UPWARDS OF A THOUSAND PLACES

SAYS
SAY WHO IS YOU WHAR IS YOU DOG MY CATS EF I DIDN' HEAR SUMF'N
WELL I KNOW WHAT I'S GWYNE TO DO I'S GWYNE TO SET DOWN HERE AND
LISTEN TELL I HEARS IT AGIN
SO HE SET DOWN ON THE GROUND BETWIXT ME AND TOM
HE LEANED HIS BACK UP
AGAINST A TREE AND STRETCHED HIS LEGS OUT TILL ONE OF THEM MOST TOUCHED
ONE OF MINE
MY NOSE BEGUN TO ITCH
IT ITCHED TILL THE TEARS COME INTO
MY EYES
BUT I DASN'T SCRATCH
THEN IT BEGUN TO ITCH ON THE INSIDE
NEXT I GOT TO ITCHING UNDERNEATH
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I WAS GOING TO SET
STILL
THIS MISERABLENESS WENT ON AS MUCH AS SIX OR SEVEN MINUTES BUT
IT SEEMED A SIGHT LONGER THAN THAT
I WAS ITCHING IN ELEVEN DIFFERENT
PLACES NOW
I RECKONED I COULDN'T STAND IT MORE'N A MINUTE LONGER
BUT I SET MY TEETH HARD AND GOT READY TO TRY
JUST THEN JIM BEGUN
TO BREATHE HEAVY NEXT HE BEGUN TO SNORE AND THEN I WAS PRETTY SOON
COMFORTABLE AGAIN
TOM HE MADE A SIGN TO ME KIND OF A LITTLE NOISE WITH HIS MOUTH AND WE
WENT CREEPING AWAY ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES
WHEN WE WAS TEN FOOT OFF TOM
WHISPERED TO ME AND WANTED TO TIE JIM TO THE TREE FOR FUN
BUT I SAID
NO HE MIGHT WAKE AND MAKE A DISTURBANCE AND THEN THEY'D FIND OUT I
WARN'T IN
THEN TOM SAID HE HADN'T GOT CANDLES ENOUGH AND HE WOULD SLIP
IN THE KITCHEN AND GET SOME MORE
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO TRY
I SAID JIM
MIGHT WAKE UP AND COME
BUT TOM WANTED TO RESK IT SO WE SLID IN THERE
AND GOT THREE CANDLES AND TOM LAID FIVE CENTS ON THE TABLE FOR PAY
THEN WE GOT OUT AND I WAS IN A SWEAT TO GET AWAY BUT NOTHING WOULD DO
TOM BUT HE MUST CRAWL TO WHERE JIM WAS ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES AND PLAY
SOMETHING ON HIM
I WAITED AND IT SEEMED A GOOD WHILE EVERYTHING WAS
SO STILL AND LONESOME
AS SOON AS TOM WAS BACK WE CUT ALONG THE PATH AROUND THE GARDEN FENCE
AND BY AND BY FETCHED UP ON THE STEEP TOP OF THE HILL THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE HOUSE
TOM SAID HE SLIPPED JIM'S HAT OFF OF HIS HEAD AND HUNG IT
ON A LIMB RIGHT OVER HIM AND JIM STIRRED A LITTLE BUT HE DIDN'T WAKE
AFTERWARDS JIM SAID THE WITCHES BE WITCHED HIM AND PUT HIM IN A TRANCE
AND RODE HIM ALL OVER THE STATE AND THEN SET HIM UNDER THE TREES AGAIN
AND HUNG HIS HAT ON A LIMB TO SHOW WHO DONE IT
AND NEXT TIME JIM TOLD
IT HE SAID THEY RODE HIM DOWN TO NEW ORLEANS AND AFTER THAT EVERY
TIME HE TOLD IT HE SPREAD IT MORE AND MORE TILL BY AND BY HE SAID THEY
RODE HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND TIRED HIM MOST TO DEATH AND HIS BACK
WAS ALL OVER SADDLE BOILS
JIM WAS MONSTROUS PROUD ABOUT IT AND HE
GOT SO HE WOULDN'T HARDLY NOTICE THE OTHER NIGGERS
NIGGERS WOULD COME
MILES TO HEAR JIM TELL ABOUT IT AND HE WAS MORE LOOKED UP TO THAN ANY
NIGGER IN THAT COUNTRY
STRANGE NIGGERS WOULD STAND WITH THEIR MOUTHS
OPEN AND LOOK HIM ALL OVER SAME AS IF HE WAS A WONDER
NIGGERS IS
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT WITCHES IN THE DARK BY THE KITCHEN FIRE BUT
WHENEVER ONE WAS TALKING AND LETTING ON TO KNOW ALL ABOUT SUCH THINGS
JIM WOULD HAPPEN IN AND SAY HM WHAT YOU KNOW 'BOUT WITCHES AND
THAT NIGGER WAS CORKED UP AND HAD TO TAKE A BACK SEAT
JIM ALWAYS KEPT
THAT FIVE CENTER PIECE ROUND HIS NECK WITH A STRING AND SAID IT WAS A
CHARM THE DEVIL GIVE TO HIM WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND TOLD HIM HE COULD
CURE ANYBODY WITH IT AND FETCH WITCHES WHENEVER HE WANTED TO JUST BY
SAYING SOMETHING TO IT BUT HE NEVER TOLD WHAT IT WAS HE SAID TO IT
NIGGERS WOULD COME FROM ALL AROUND THERE AND GIVE JIM ANYTHING THEY
HAD JUST FOR A SIGHT OF THAT FIVE CENTER PIECE BUT THEY WOULDN'T TOUCH
IT BECAUSE THE DEVIL HAD HAD HIS HANDS ON IT
JIM WAS MOST RUINED FOR
A SERVANT BECAUSE HE GOT STUCK UP ON ACCOUNT OF HAVING SEEN THE DEVIL
AND BEEN RODE BY WITCHES
WELL WHEN TOM AND ME GOT TO THE EDGE OF THE HILLTOP WE LOOKED AWAY DOWN
INTO THE VILLAGE AND COULD SEE THREE OR FOUR LIGHTS TWINKLING WHERE
THERE WAS SICK FOLKS MAYBE AND THE STARS OVER US WAS SPARKLING EVER
SO FINE AND DOWN BY THE VILLAGE WAS THE RIVER A WHOLE MILE BROAD AND
AWFUL STILL AND GRAND
WE WENT DOWN THE HILL AND FOUND JO HARPER AND
BEN ROGERS AND TWO OR THREE MORE OF THE BOYS HID IN THE OLD TANYARD
SO WE UNHITCHED A SKIFF AND PULLED DOWN THE RIVER TWO MILE AND A HALF
TO THE BIG SCAR ON THE HILLSIDE AND WENT ASHORE
WE WENT TO A CLUMP OF BUSHES AND TOM MADE EVERYBODY SWEAR TO KEEP THE
SECRET AND THEN SHOWED THEM A HOLE IN THE HILL RIGHT IN THE THICKEST
PART OF THE BUSHES
THEN WE LIT THE CANDLES AND CRAWLED IN ON OUR
HANDS AND KNEES
WE WENT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN THE CAVE
OPENED UP
TOM POKED ABOUT AMONGST THE PASSAGES AND PRETTY SOON DUCKED
UNDER A WALL WHERE YOU WOULDN'T A NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A HOLE
WE
WENT ALONG A NARROW PLACE AND GOT INTO A KIND OF ROOM ALL DAMP AND
SWEATY AND COLD AND THERE WE STOPPED
TOM SAYS
NOW WE'LL START THIS BAND OF ROBBERS AND CALL IT TOM SAWYER'S GANG
EVERYBODY THAT WANTS TO JOIN HAS GOT TO TAKE AN OATH AND WRITE HIS NAME
IN BLOOD
EVERYBODY WAS WILLING
SO TOM GOT OUT A SHEET OF PAPER THAT HE HAD
WROTE THE OATH ON AND READ IT
IT SWORE EVERY BOY TO STICK TO THE
BAND AND NEVER TELL ANY OF THE SECRETS AND IF ANYBODY DONE ANYTHING TO
ANY BOY IN THE BAND WHICHEVER BOY WAS ORDERED TO KILL THAT PERSON AND
HIS FAMILY MUST DO IT AND HE MUSTN'T EAT AND HE MUSTN'T SLEEP TILL HE
HAD KILLED THEM AND HACKED A CROSS IN THEIR BREASTS WHICH WAS THE SIGN
OF THE BAND
AND NOBODY THAT DIDN'T BELONG TO THE BAND COULD USE THAT
MARK AND IF HE DID HE MUST BE SUED AND IF HE DONE IT AGAIN HE MUST BE
KILLED
AND IF ANYBODY THAT BELONGED TO THE BAND TOLD THE SECRETS HE
MUST HAVE HIS THROAT CUT AND THEN HAVE HIS CARCASS BURNT UP AND THE
ASHES SCATTERED ALL AROUND AND HIS NAME BLOTTED OFF OF THE LIST WITH
BLOOD AND NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN BY THE GANG BUT HAVE A CURSE PUT ON IT
AND BE FORGOT FOREVER
EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS A REAL BEAUTIFUL OATH AND ASKED TOM IF HE GOT
IT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD
HE SAID SOME OF IT BUT THE REST WAS OUT OF
PIRATE BOOKS AND ROBBER BOOKS AND EVERY GANG THAT WAS HIGH TONED HAD
IT
SOME THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KILL THE FAMILIES OF BOYS THAT TOLD
THE SECRETS
TOM SAID IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO HE TOOK A PENCIL AND WROTE
IT IN
THEN BEN ROGERS SAYS
HERE'S HUCK FINN HE HAIN'T GOT NO FAMILY WHAT YOU GOING TO DO 'BOUT
HIM
WELL HAIN'T HE GOT A FATHER SAYS TOM SAWYER
YES HE'S GOT A FATHER BUT YOU CAN'T NEVER FIND HIM THESE DAYS
HE
USED TO LAY DRUNK WITH THE HOGS IN THE TANYARD BUT HE HAIN'T BEEN SEEN
IN THESE PARTS FOR A YEAR OR MORE
THEY TALKED IT OVER AND THEY WAS GOING TO RULE ME OUT BECAUSE THEY
SAID EVERY BOY MUST HAVE A FAMILY OR SOMEBODY TO KILL OR ELSE IT
WOULDN'T BE FAIR AND SQUARE FOR THE OTHERS
WELL NOBODY COULD THINK OF
ANYTHING TO DO EVERYBODY WAS STUMPED AND SET STILL
I WAS MOST READY
TO CRY BUT ALL AT ONCE I THOUGHT OF A WAY AND SO I OFFERED THEM MISS
WATSON THEY COULD KILL HER
EVERYBODY SAID
OH SHE'LL DO
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
HUCK CAN COME IN
THEN THEY ALL STUCK A PIN IN THEIR FINGERS TO GET BLOOD TO SIGN WITH
AND I MADE MY MARK ON THE PAPER
NOW SAYS BEN ROGERS WHAT'S THE LINE OF BUSINESS OF THIS GANG
NOTHING ONLY ROBBERY AND MURDER TOM SAID
BUT WHO ARE WE GOING TO ROB HOUSES OR CATTLE OR
STUFF STEALING CATTLE AND SUCH THINGS AIN'T ROBBERY IT'S BURGLARY
SAYS TOM SAWYER
WE AIN'T BURGLARS
THAT AIN'T NO SORT OF STYLE
WE
ARE HIGHWAYMEN
WE STOP STAGES AND CARRIAGES ON THE ROAD WITH MASKS
ON AND KILL THE PEOPLE AND TAKE THEIR WATCHES AND MONEY
MUST WE ALWAYS KILL THE PEOPLE
OH CERTAINLY
IT'S BEST
SOME AUTHORITIES THINK DIFFERENT BUT
MOSTLY IT'S CONSIDERED BEST TO KILL THEM EXCEPT SOME THAT YOU BRING TO
THE CAVE HERE AND KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE RANSOMED
RANSOMED WHAT'S THAT
I DON'T KNOW
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
I'VE SEEN IT IN BOOKS AND SO
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO
BUT HOW CAN WE DO IT IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
WHY BLAME IT ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO IT
DON'T I TELL YOU IT'S IN THE
BOOKS DO YOU WANT TO GO TO DOING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S IN THE BOOKS
AND GET THINGS ALL MUDDLED UP
OH THAT'S ALL VERY FINE TO SAY TOM SAWYER BUT HOW IN THE NATION
ARE THESE FELLOWS GOING TO BE RANSOMED IF WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT
TO THEM THAT'S THE THING I WANT TO GET AT
NOW WHAT DO YOU RECKON IT
IS
WELL I DON'T KNOW
BUT PER'APS IF WE KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE RANSOMED
IT MEANS THAT WE KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE DEAD
NOW THAT'S SOMETHING LIKE
THAT'LL ANSWER
WHY COULDN'T YOU SAID
THAT BEFORE WE'LL KEEP THEM TILL THEY'RE RANSOMED TO DEATH AND A
BOTHERSOME LOT THEY'LL BE TOO EATING UP EVERYTHING AND ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET LOOSE
HOW YOU TALK BEN ROGERS
HOW CAN THEY GET LOOSE WHEN THERE'S A GUARD
OVER THEM READY TO SHOOT THEM DOWN IF THEY MOVE A PEG
A GUARD WELL THAT IS GOOD
SO SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SET UP ALL NIGHT
AND NEVER GET ANY SLEEP JUST SO AS TO WATCH THEM
I THINK THAT'S
FOOLISHNESS
WHY CAN'T A BODY TAKE A CLUB AND RANSOM THEM AS SOON AS
THEY GET HERE
BECAUSE IT AIN'T IN THE BOOKS SO THAT'S WHY
NOW BEN ROGERS DO YOU
WANT TO DO THINGS REGULAR OR DON'T YOU THAT'S THE IDEA
DON'T YOU
RECKON THAT THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THE BOOKS KNOWS WHAT'S THE CORRECT
THING TO DO DO YOU RECKON YOU CAN LEARN 'EM ANYTHING NOT BY A GOOD
DEAL
NO SIR WE'LL JUST GO ON AND RANSOM THEM IN THE REGULAR WAY
ALL RIGHT
I DON'T MIND BUT I SAY IT'S A FOOL WAY ANYHOW
SAY DO
WE KILL THE WOMEN TOO
WELL BEN ROGERS IF I WAS AS IGNORANT AS YOU I WOULDN'T LET ON
KILL
THE WOMEN NO NOBODY EVER SAW ANYTHING IN THE BOOKS LIKE THAT
YOU
FETCH THEM TO THE CAVE AND YOU'RE ALWAYS AS POLITE AS PIE TO THEM
AND BY AND BY THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND NEVER WANT TO GO HOME ANY
MORE
WELL IF THAT'S THE WAY I'M AGREED BUT I DON'T TAKE NO STOCK IN IT
MIGHTY SOON WE'LL HAVE THE CAVE SO CLUTTERED UP WITH WOMEN AND FELLOWS
WAITING TO BE RANSOMED THAT THERE WON'T BE NO PLACE FOR THE ROBBERS
BUT GO AHEAD I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY
LITTLE TOMMY BARNES WAS ASLEEP NOW AND WHEN THEY WAKED HIM UP HE WAS
SCARED AND CRIED AND SAID HE WANTED TO GO HOME TO HIS MA AND DIDN'T
WANT TO BE A ROBBER ANY MORE
SO THEY ALL MADE FUN OF HIM AND CALLED HIM CRY BABY AND THAT MADE HIM
MAD AND HE SAID HE WOULD GO STRAIGHT AND TELL ALL THE SECRETS
BUT
TOM GIVE HIM FIVE CENTS TO KEEP QUIET AND SAID WE WOULD ALL GO HOME AND
MEET NEXT WEEK AND ROB SOMEBODY AND KILL SOME PEOPLE
BEN ROGERS SAID HE COULDN'T GET OUT MUCH ONLY SUNDAYS AND SO HE WANTED
TO BEGIN NEXT SUNDAY BUT ALL THE BOYS SAID IT WOULD BE WICKED TO DO IT
ON SUNDAY AND THAT SETTLED THE THING
THEY AGREED TO GET TOGETHER AND
FIX A DAY AS SOON AS THEY COULD AND THEN WE ELECTED TOM SAWYER FIRST
CAPTAIN AND JO HARPER SECOND CAPTAIN OF THE GANG AND SO STARTED HOME
I CLUMB UP THE SHED AND CREPT INTO MY WINDOW JUST BEFORE DAY WAS
BREAKING
MY NEW CLOTHES WAS ALL GREASED UP AND CLAYEY AND I WAS
DOG TIRED
CHAPTER III
WELL I GOT A GOOD GOING OVER IN THE MORNING FROM OLD MISS WATSON ON
ACCOUNT OF MY CLOTHES BUT THE WIDOW SHE DIDN'T SCOLD BUT ONLY CLEANED
OFF THE GREASE AND CLAY AND LOOKED SO SORRY THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD
BEHAVE AWHILE IF I COULD
THEN MISS WATSON SHE TOOK ME IN THE CLOSET
AND PRAYED BUT NOTHING COME OF IT
SHE TOLD ME TO PRAY EVERY DAY AND
WHATEVER I ASKED FOR I WOULD GET IT
BUT IT WARN'T SO
I TRIED IT
ONCE I GOT A FISH LINE BUT NO HOOKS
IT WARN'T ANY GOOD TO ME WITHOUT
HOOKS
I TRIED FOR THE HOOKS THREE OR FOUR TIMES BUT SOMEHOW I
COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK
BY AND BY ONE DAY I ASKED MISS WATSON TO
TRY FOR ME BUT SHE SAID I WAS A FOOL
SHE NEVER TOLD ME WHY AND I
COULDN'T MAKE IT OUT NO WAY
I SET DOWN ONE TIME BACK IN THE WOODS AND HAD A LONG THINK ABOUT IT
I SAYS TO MYSELF IF A BODY CAN GET ANYTHING THEY PRAY FOR WHY DON'T
DEACON WINN GET BACK THE MONEY HE LOST ON PORK WHY CAN'T THE WIDOW GET
BACK HER SILVER SNUFFBOX THAT WAS STOLE WHY CAN'T MISS WATSON FAT UP
NO SAYS I TO MY SELF THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN IT
I WENT AND TOLD THE
WIDOW ABOUT IT AND SHE SAID THE THING A BODY COULD GET BY PRAYING FOR
IT WAS SPIRITUAL GIFTS THIS WAS TOO MANY FOR ME BUT SHE TOLD ME
WHAT SHE MEANT I MUST HELP OTHER PEOPLE AND DO EVERYTHING I COULD FOR
OTHER PEOPLE AND LOOK OUT FOR THEM ALL THE TIME AND NEVER THINK ABOUT
MYSELF
THIS WAS INCLUDING MISS WATSON AS I TOOK IT
I WENT OUT IN THE
WOODS AND TURNED IT OVER IN MY MIND A LONG TIME BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO
ADVANTAGE ABOUT IT EXCEPT FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE SO AT LAST I RECKONED
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT ANY MORE BUT JUST LET IT GO
SOMETIMES THE
WIDOW WOULD TAKE ME ONE SIDE AND TALK ABOUT PROVIDENCE IN A WAY TO MAKE
A BODY'S MOUTH WATER BUT MAYBE NEXT DAY MISS WATSON WOULD TAKE HOLD
AND KNOCK IT ALL DOWN AGAIN
I JUDGED I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS TWO
PROVIDENCES AND A POOR CHAP WOULD STAND CONSIDERABLE SHOW WITH THE
WIDOW'S PROVIDENCE BUT IF MISS WATSON'S GOT HIM THERE WARN'T NO HELP
FOR HIM ANY MORE
I THOUGHT IT ALL OUT AND RECKONED I WOULD BELONG
TO THE WIDOW'S IF HE WANTED ME THOUGH I COULDN'T MAKE OUT HOW HE WAS
A GOING TO BE ANY BETTER OFF THEN THAN WHAT HE WAS BEFORE SEEING I WAS
SO IGNORANT AND SO KIND OF LOW DOWN AND ORNERY
PAP HE HADN'T BEEN SEEN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND THAT WAS COMFORTABLE
FOR ME I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM NO MORE
HE USED TO ALWAYS WHALE ME
WHEN HE WAS SOBER AND COULD GET HIS HANDS ON ME THOUGH I USED TO TAKE
TO THE WOODS MOST OF THE TIME WHEN HE WAS AROUND
WELL ABOUT THIS TIME
HE WAS FOUND IN THE RIVER DROWNDED ABOUT TWELVE MILE ABOVE TOWN SO
PEOPLE SAID
THEY JUDGED IT WAS HIM ANYWAY SAID THIS DROWNDED MAN WAS
JUST HIS SIZE AND WAS RAGGED AND HAD UNCOMMON LONG HAIR WHICH WAS ALL
LIKE PAP BUT THEY COULDN'T MAKE NOTHING OUT OF THE FACE BECAUSE IT HAD
BEEN IN THE WATER SO LONG IT WARN'T MUCH LIKE A FACE AT ALL
THEY SAID
HE WAS FLOATING ON HIS BACK IN THE WATER
THEY TOOK HIM AND BURIED HIM
ON THE BANK
BUT I WARN'T COMFORTABLE LONG BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO THINK
OF SOMETHING
I KNOWED MIGHTY WELL THAT A DROWNDED MAN DON'T FLOAT ON
HIS BACK BUT ON HIS FACE
SO I KNOWED THEN THAT THIS WARN'T PAP BUT
A WOMAN DRESSED UP IN A MAN'S CLOTHES
SO I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AGAIN
I JUDGED THE OLD MAN WOULD TURN UP AGAIN BY AND BY THOUGH I WISHED HE
WOULDN'T
WE PLAYED ROBBER NOW AND THEN ABOUT A MONTH AND THEN I RESIGNED
ALL
THE BOYS DID
WE HADN'T ROBBED NOBODY HADN'T KILLED ANY PEOPLE BUT
ONLY JUST PRETENDED
WE USED TO HOP OUT OF THE WOODS AND GO CHARGING
DOWN ON HOG DRIVERS AND WOMEN IN CARTS TAKING GARDEN STUFF TO MARKET
BUT WE NEVER HIVED ANY OF THEM
TOM SAWYER CALLED THE HOGS INGOTS
AND HE CALLED THE TURNIPS AND STUFF JULERY AND WE WOULD GO TO THE
CAVE AND POWWOW OVER WHAT WE HAD DONE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HAD KILLED
AND MARKED
BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO PROFIT IN IT
ONE TIME TOM SENT A
BOY TO RUN ABOUT TOWN WITH A BLAZING STICK WHICH HE CALLED A SLOGAN
WHICH WAS THE SIGN FOR THE GANG TO GET TOGETHER AND THEN HE SAID HE
HAD GOT SECRET NEWS BY HIS SPIES THAT NEXT DAY A WHOLE PARCEL OF SPANISH
MERCHANTS AND RICH A RABS WAS GOING TO CAMP IN CAVE HOLLOW WITH TWO
HUNDRED ELEPHANTS AND SIX HUNDRED CAMELS AND OVER A THOUSAND SUMTER
MULES ALL LOADED DOWN WITH DI'MONDS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONLY A GUARD
OF FOUR HUNDRED SOLDIERS AND SO WE WOULD LAY IN AMBUSCADE AS HE CALLED
IT AND KILL THE LOT AND SCOOP THE THINGS
HE SAID WE MUST SLICK UP
OUR SWORDS AND GUNS AND GET READY
HE NEVER COULD GO AFTER EVEN A
TURNIP CART BUT HE MUST HAVE THE SWORDS AND GUNS ALL SCOURED UP FOR IT
THOUGH THEY WAS ONLY LATH AND BROOMSTICKS AND YOU MIGHT SCOUR AT THEM
TILL YOU ROTTED AND THEN THEY WARN'T WORTH A MOUTHFUL OF ASHES MORE
THAN WHAT THEY WAS BEFORE
I DIDN'T BELIEVE WE COULD LICK SUCH A CROWD
OF SPANIARDS AND A RABS BUT I WANTED TO SEE THE CAMELS AND ELEPHANTS
SO I WAS ON HAND NEXT DAY SATURDAY IN THE AMBUSCADE AND WHEN WE GOT
THE WORD WE RUSHED OUT OF THE WOODS AND DOWN THE HILL
BUT THERE WARN'T
NO SPANIARDS AND A RABS AND THERE WARN'T NO CAMELS NOR NO ELEPHANTS
IT WARN'T ANYTHING BUT A SUNDAY SCHOOL PICNIC AND ONLY A PRIMER CLASS
AT THAT
WE BUSTED IT UP AND CHASED THE CHILDREN UP THE HOLLOW BUT WE
NEVER GOT ANYTHING BUT SOME DOUGHNUTS AND JAM THOUGH BEN ROGERS GOT
A RAG DOLL AND JO HARPER GOT A HYMN BOOK AND A TRACT AND THEN THE
TEACHER CHARGED IN AND MADE US DROP EVERYTHING AND CUT
I DIDN'T SEE NO DI'MONDS AND I TOLD TOM SAWYER SO
HE SAID THERE WAS
LOADS OF THEM THERE ANYWAY AND HE SAID THERE WAS A RABS THERE TOO
AND ELEPHANTS AND THINGS
I SAID WHY COULDN'T WE SEE THEM THEN HE
SAID IF I WARN'T SO IGNORANT BUT HAD READ A BOOK CALLED DON QUIXOTE I
WOULD KNOW WITHOUT ASKING
HE SAID IT WAS ALL DONE BY ENCHANTMENT
HE
SAID THERE WAS HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS THERE AND ELEPHANTS AND TREASURE
AND SO ON BUT WE HAD ENEMIES WHICH HE CALLED MAGICIANS AND THEY HAD
TURNED THE WHOLE THING INTO AN INFANT SUNDAY SCHOOL JUST OUT OF SPITE
I SAID ALL RIGHT THEN THE THING FOR US TO DO WAS TO GO FOR THE
MAGICIANS
TOM SAWYER SAID I WAS A NUMSKULL
WHY SAID HE A MAGICIAN COULD CALL UP A LOT OF GENIES AND THEY
WOULD HASH YOU UP LIKE NOTHING BEFORE YOU COULD SAY JACK ROBINSON
THEY
ARE AS TALL AS A TREE AND AS BIG AROUND AS A CHURCH
WELL I SAYS S'POSE WE GOT SOME GENIES TO HELP US CAN'T WE LICK
THE OTHER CROWD THEN
HOW YOU GOING TO GET THEM
I DON'T KNOW
HOW DO THEY GET THEM
WHY THEY RUB AN OLD TIN LAMP OR AN IRON RING AND THEN THE GENIES
COME TEARING IN WITH THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING A RIPPING AROUND AND THE
SMOKE A ROLLING AND EVERYTHING THEY'RE TOLD TO DO THEY UP AND DO IT
THEY DON'T THINK NOTHING OF PULLING A SHOT TOWER UP BY THE ROOTS AND
BELTING A SUNDAY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT OVER THE HEAD WITH IT OR ANY
OTHER MAN
WHO MAKES THEM TEAR AROUND SO
WHY WHOEVER RUBS THE LAMP OR THE RING
THEY BELONG TO WHOEVER RUBS
THE LAMP OR THE RING AND THEY'VE GOT TO DO WHATEVER HE SAYS
IF HE
TELLS THEM TO BUILD A PALACE FORTY MILES LONG OUT OF DI'MONDS AND FILL
IT FULL OF CHEWING GUM OR WHATEVER YOU WANT AND FETCH AN EMPEROR'S
DAUGHTER FROM CHINA FOR YOU TO MARRY THEY'VE GOT TO DO IT AND THEY'VE
GOT TO DO IT BEFORE SUN UP NEXT MORNING TOO
AND MORE THEY'VE GOT
TO WALTZ THAT PALACE AROUND OVER THE COUNTRY WHEREVER YOU WANT IT YOU
UNDERSTAND
WELL SAYS I I THINK THEY ARE A PACK OF FLAT HEADS FOR NOT KEEPING
THE PALACE THEMSELVES 'STEAD OF FOOLING THEM AWAY LIKE THAT
AND WHAT'S
MORE IF I WAS ONE OF THEM I WOULD SEE A MAN IN JERICHO BEFORE I WOULD
DROP MY BUSINESS AND COME TO HIM FOR THE RUBBING OF AN OLD TIN LAMP
HOW YOU TALK HUCK FINN
WHY YOU'D HAVE TO COME WHEN HE RUBBED IT
WHETHER YOU WANTED TO OR NOT
WHAT AND I AS HIGH AS A TREE AND AS BIG AS A CHURCH ALL RIGHT THEN
I WOULD COME BUT I LAY I'D MAKE THAT MAN CLIMB THE HIGHEST TREE THERE
WAS IN THE COUNTRY
SHUCKS IT AIN'T NO USE TO TALK TO YOU HUCK FINN
YOU DON'T SEEM TO
KNOW ANYTHING SOMEHOW PERFECT SAPHEAD
I THOUGHT ALL THIS OVER FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND THEN I RECKONED I
WOULD SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN IT
I GOT AN OLD TIN LAMP AND AN
IRON RING AND WENT OUT IN THE WOODS AND RUBBED AND RUBBED TILL I SWEAT
LIKE AN INJUN CALCULATING TO BUILD A PALACE AND SELL IT BUT IT WARN'T
NO USE NONE OF THE GENIES COME
SO THEN I JUDGED THAT ALL THAT STUFF
WAS ONLY JUST ONE OF TOM SAWYER'S LIES
I RECKONED HE BELIEVED IN THE
A RABS AND THE ELEPHANTS BUT AS FOR ME I THINK DIFFERENT
IT HAD ALL
THE MARKS OF A SUNDAY SCHOOL
CHAPTER IV
WELL THREE OR FOUR MONTHS RUN ALONG AND IT WAS WELL INTO THE WINTER
NOW
I HAD BEEN TO SCHOOL MOST ALL THE TIME AND COULD SPELL AND READ AND
WRITE JUST A LITTLE AND COULD SAY THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE UP TO SIX
TIMES SEVEN IS THIRTY FIVE AND I DON'T RECKON I COULD EVER GET ANY
FURTHER THAN THAT IF I WAS TO LIVE FOREVER
I DON'T TAKE NO STOCK IN
MATHEMATICS ANYWAY
AT FIRST I HATED THE SCHOOL BUT BY AND BY I GOT SO I COULD STAND IT
WHENEVER I GOT UNCOMMON TIRED I PLAYED HOOKEY AND THE HIDING I GOT NEXT
DAY DONE ME GOOD AND CHEERED ME UP
SO THE LONGER I WENT TO SCHOOL THE
EASIER IT GOT TO BE
I WAS GETTING SORT OF USED TO THE WIDOW'S WAYS
TOO AND THEY WARN'T SO RASPY ON ME
LIVING IN A HOUSE AND SLEEPING IN
A BED PULLED ON ME PRETTY TIGHT MOSTLY BUT BEFORE THE COLD WEATHER I
USED TO SLIDE OUT AND SLEEP IN THE WOODS SOMETIMES AND SO THAT WAS A
REST TO ME
I LIKED THE OLD WAYS BEST BUT I WAS GETTING SO I LIKED THE
NEW ONES TOO A LITTLE BIT
THE WIDOW SAID I WAS COMING ALONG SLOW BUT
SURE AND DOING VERY SATISFACTORY
SHE SAID SHE WARN'T ASHAMED OF ME
ONE MORNING I HAPPENED TO TURN OVER THE SALT CELLAR AT BREAKFAST
I REACHED FOR SOME OF IT AS QUICK AS I COULD TO THROW OVER MY LEFT
SHOULDER AND KEEP OFF THE BAD LUCK BUT MISS WATSON WAS IN AHEAD OF ME
AND CROSSED ME OFF
SHE SAYS TAKE YOUR HANDS AWAY HUCKLEBERRY WHAT
A MESS YOU ARE ALWAYS MAKING THE WIDOW PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ME BUT
THAT WARN'T GOING TO KEEP OFF THE BAD LUCK I KNOWED THAT WELL ENOUGH
I STARTED OUT AFTER BREAKFAST FEELING WORRIED AND SHAKY AND
WONDERING WHERE IT WAS GOING TO FALL ON ME AND WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE
THERE IS WAYS TO KEEP OFF SOME KINDS OF BAD LUCK BUT THIS WASN'T ONE
OF THEM KIND SO I NEVER TRIED TO DO ANYTHING BUT JUST POKED ALONG
LOW SPIRITED AND ON THE WATCH OUT
I WENT DOWN TO THE FRONT GARDEN AND CLUMB OVER THE STILE WHERE YOU GO
THROUGH THE HIGH BOARD FENCE
THERE WAS AN INCH OF NEW SNOW ON THE
GROUND AND I SEEN SOMEBODY'S TRACKS
THEY HAD COME UP FROM THE QUARRY
AND STOOD AROUND THE STILE A WHILE AND THEN WENT ON AROUND THE GARDEN
FENCE
IT WAS FUNNY THEY HADN'T COME IN AFTER STANDING AROUND SO
I
COULDN'T MAKE IT OUT
IT WAS VERY CURIOUS SOMEHOW
I WAS GOING TO
FOLLOW AROUND BUT I STOOPED DOWN TO LOOK AT THE TRACKS FIRST
I DIDN'T
NOTICE ANYTHING AT FIRST BUT NEXT I DID
THERE WAS A CROSS IN THE LEFT
BOOT HEEL MADE WITH BIG NAILS TO KEEP OFF THE DEVIL
I WAS UP IN A SECOND AND SHINNING DOWN THE HILL
I LOOKED OVER MY
SHOULDER EVERY NOW AND THEN BUT I DIDN'T SEE NOBODY
I WAS AT JUDGE
THATCHER'S AS QUICK AS I COULD GET THERE
HE SAID
WHY MY BOY YOU ARE ALL OUT OF BREATH
DID YOU COME FOR YOUR
INTEREST
NO SIR I SAYS IS THERE SOME FOR ME
OH YES A HALF YEARLY IS IN LAST NIGHT OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY
DOLLARS
QUITE A FORTUNE FOR YOU
YOU HAD BETTER LET ME INVEST IT
ALONG WITH YOUR SIX THOUSAND BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE IT YOU'LL SPEND IT
NO SIR I SAYS I DON'T WANT TO SPEND IT
I DON'T WANT IT AT
ALL NOR THE SIX THOUSAND NUTHER
I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT I WANT TO GIVE
IT TO YOU THE SIX THOUSAND AND ALL
HE LOOKED SURPRISED
HE COULDN'T SEEM TO MAKE IT OUT
HE SAYS
WHY WHAT CAN YOU MEAN MY BOY
I SAYS DON'T YOU ASK ME NO QUESTIONS ABOUT IT PLEASE
YOU'LL TAKE
IT WON'T YOU
HE SAYS
WELL I'M PUZZLED
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER
PLEASE TAKE IT SAYS I AND DON'T ASK ME NOTHING THEN I WON'T HAVE TO
TELL NO LIES
HE STUDIED A WHILE AND THEN HE SAYS
OHO O I THINK I SEE
YOU WANT TO SELL ALL YOUR PROPERTY TO ME NOT
GIVE IT
THAT'S THE CORRECT IDEA
THEN HE WROTE SOMETHING ON A PAPER AND READ IT OVER AND SAYS
THERE YOU SEE IT SAYS 'FOR A CONSIDERATION THAT MEANS I HAVE BOUGHT
IT OF YOU AND PAID YOU FOR IT
HERE'S A DOLLAR FOR YOU
NOW YOU SIGN
IT
SO I SIGNED IT AND LEFT
MISS WATSON'S NIGGER JIM HAD A HAIR BALL AS BIG AS YOUR FIST WHICH
HAD BEEN TOOK OUT OF THE FOURTH STOMACH OF AN OX AND HE USED TO DO
MAGIC WITH IT
HE SAID THERE WAS A SPIRIT INSIDE OF IT AND IT KNOWED
EVERYTHING
SO I WENT TO HIM THAT NIGHT AND TOLD HIM PAP WAS HERE
AGAIN FOR I FOUND HIS TRACKS IN THE SNOW
WHAT I WANTED TO KNOW WAS
WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO AND WAS HE GOING TO STAY JIM GOT OUT HIS
HAIR BALL AND SAID SOMETHING OVER IT AND THEN HE HELD IT UP AND DROPPED
IT ON THE FLOOR
IT FELL PRETTY SOLID AND ONLY ROLLED ABOUT AN INCH
JIM TRIED IT AGAIN AND THEN ANOTHER TIME AND IT ACTED JUST THE SAME
JIM GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND PUT HIS EAR AGAINST IT AND LISTENED
BUT IT WARN'T NO USE HE SAID IT WOULDN'T TALK
HE SAID SOMETIMES IT
WOULDN'T TALK WITHOUT MONEY
I TOLD HIM I HAD AN OLD SLICK COUNTERFEIT
QUARTER THAT WARN'T NO GOOD BECAUSE THE BRASS SHOWED THROUGH THE SILVER
A LITTLE AND IT WOULDN'T PASS NOHOW EVEN IF THE BRASS DIDN'T SHOW
BECAUSE IT WAS SO SLICK IT FELT GREASY AND SO THAT WOULD TELL ON IT
EVERY TIME
I RECKONED I WOULDN'T SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE DOLLAR I GOT
FROM THE JUDGE I SAID IT WAS PRETTY BAD MONEY BUT MAYBE THE HAIR BALL
WOULD TAKE IT BECAUSE MAYBE IT WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
JIM SMELT
IT AND BIT IT AND RUBBED IT AND SAID HE WOULD MANAGE SO THE HAIR BALL
WOULD THINK IT WAS GOOD
HE SAID HE WOULD SPLIT OPEN A RAW IRISH POTATO
AND STICK THE QUARTER IN BETWEEN AND KEEP IT THERE ALL NIGHT AND NEXT
MORNING YOU COULDN'T SEE NO BRASS AND IT WOULDN'T FEEL GREASY NO MORE
AND SO ANYBODY IN TOWN WOULD TAKE IT IN A MINUTE LET ALONE A HAIR BALL
WELL I KNOWED A POTATO WOULD DO THAT BEFORE BUT I HAD FORGOT IT
JIM PUT THE QUARTER UNDER THE HAIR BALL AND GOT DOWN AND LISTENED
AGAIN
THIS TIME HE SAID THE HAIR BALL WAS ALL RIGHT
HE SAID IT
WOULD TELL MY WHOLE FORTUNE IF I WANTED IT TO
I SAYS GO ON
SO THE
HAIR BALL TALKED TO JIM AND JIM TOLD IT TO ME
HE SAYS
YO' OLE FATHER DOAN' KNOW YIT WHAT HE'S A GWYNE TO DO
SOMETIMES HE
SPEC HE'LL GO 'WAY EN DEN AGIN HE SPEC HE'LL STAY

WHEN I LIT MY CANDLE AND WENT UP TO MY ROOM THAT NIGHT THERE SAT PAP HIS
OWN SELF
CHAPTER V
I HAD SHUT THE DOOR TO
THEN I TURNED AROUND AND THERE HE WAS
I USED
TO BE SCARED OF HIM ALL THE TIME HE TANNED ME SO MUCH
I RECKONED I
WAS SCARED NOW TOO BUT IN A MINUTE I SEE I WAS MISTAKEN THAT IS AFTER
THE FIRST JOLT AS YOU MAY SAY WHEN MY BREATH SORT OF HITCHED HE BEING
SO UNEXPECTED BUT RIGHT AWAY AFTER I SEE I WARN'T SCARED OF HIM WORTH
BOTHRING ABOUT
HE WAS MOST FIFTY AND HE LOOKED IT
HIS HAIR WAS LONG AND TANGLED AND
GREASY AND HUNG DOWN AND YOU COULD SEE HIS EYES SHINING THROUGH
LIKE HE WAS BEHIND VINES
IT WAS ALL BLACK NO GRAY SO WAS HIS LONG
MIXED UP WHISKERS
THERE WARN'T NO COLOR IN HIS FACE WHERE HIS FACE
SHOWED IT WAS WHITE NOT LIKE ANOTHER MAN'S WHITE BUT A WHITE TO MAKE
A BODY SICK A WHITE TO MAKE A BODY'S FLESH CRAWL A TREE TOAD WHITE A
FISH BELLY WHITE

WHEN HE HAD GOT OUT ON THE SHED HE PUT HIS HEAD IN AGAIN AND CUSSED
ME FOR PUTTING ON FRILLS AND TRYING TO BE BETTER THAN HIM AND WHEN I
RECKONED HE WAS GONE HE COME BACK AND PUT HIS HEAD IN AGAIN AND TOLD ME
TO MIND ABOUT THAT SCHOOL BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO LAY FOR ME AND LICK

NEXT DAY HE WAS DRUNK AND HE WENT TO JUDGE THATCHER'S AND BULLYRAGGED
HIM AND TRIED TO MAKE HIM GIVE UP THE MONEY BUT HE COULDN'T AND THEN
HE SWORE HE'D MAKE THE LAW FORCE HIM
THE JUDGE AND THE WIDOW WENT TO LAW TO GET THE COURT TO TAKE ME AWAY
FROM HIM AND LET ONE OF THEM BE MY GUARDIAN BUT IT WAS A NEW JUDGE THAT
HAD JUST COME AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THE OLD MAN SO HE SAID COURTS MUSTN'T
INTERFERE AND SEPARATE FAMILIES IF THEY COULD HELP IT SAID HE'D DRUTHER
NOT TAKE A CHILD AWAY FROM ITS FATHER
SO JUDGE THATCHER AND THE WIDOW
HAD TO QUIT ON THE BUSINESS
THAT PLEASED THE OLD MAN TILL HE COULDN'T REST
HE SAID HE'D COWHIDE
ME TILL I WAS BLACK AND BLUE IF I DIDN'T RAISE SOME MONEY FOR HIM
I
BORROWED THREE DOLLARS FROM JUDGE THATCHER AND PAP TOOK IT AND GOT
DRUNK AND WENT A BLOWING AROUND AND CUSSING AND WHOOPING AND CARRYING
ON AND HE KEPT IT UP ALL OVER TOWN WITH A TIN PAN TILL MOST MIDNIGHT
THEN THEY JAILED HIM AND NEXT DAY THEY HAD HIM BEFORE COURT AND JAILED
HIM AGAIN FOR A WEEK
BUT HE SAID HE WAS SATISFIED SAID HE WAS BOSS
OF HIS SON AND HE'D MAKE IT WARM FOR HIM
WHEN HE GOT OUT THE NEW JUDGE SAID HE WAS A GOING TO MAKE A MAN OF HIM
SO HE TOOK HIM TO HIS OWN HOUSE AND DRESSED HIM UP CLEAN AND NICE AND
HAD HIM TO BREAKFAST AND DINNER AND SUPPER WITH THE FAMILY AND WAS JUST
OLD PIE TO HIM SO TO SPEAK
AND AFTER SUPPER HE TALKED TO HIM ABOUT
TEMPERANCE AND SUCH THINGS TILL THE OLD MAN CRIED AND SAID HE'D BEEN
A FOOL AND FOOLED AWAY HIS LIFE BUT NOW HE WAS A GOING TO TURN OVER
A NEW LEAF AND BE A MAN NOBODY WOULDN'T BE ASHAMED OF AND HE HOPED THE
JUDGE WOULD HELP HIM AND NOT LOOK DOWN ON HIM
THE JUDGE SAID HE COULD
HUG HIM FOR THEM WORDS SO HE CRIED AND HIS WIFE SHE CRIED AGAIN PAP
SAID HE'D BEEN A MAN THAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD BEFORE AND THE
JUDGE SAID HE BELIEVED IT
THE OLD MAN SAID THAT WHAT A MAN WANTED
THAT WAS DOWN WAS SYMPATHY AND THE JUDGE SAID IT WAS SO SO THEY CRIED
AGAIN
AND WHEN IT WAS BEDTIME THE OLD MAN ROSE UP AND HELD OUT HIS
HAND AND SAYS
LOOK AT IT GENTLEMEN AND LADIES ALL TAKE A HOLD OF IT SHAKE IT
THERE'S A HAND THAT WAS THE HAND OF A HOG BUT IT AIN'T SO NO MORE IT'S
THE HAND OF A MAN THAT'S STARTED IN ON A NEW LIFE AND'LL DIE BEFORE
HE'LL GO BACK
YOU MARK THEM WORDS DON'T FORGET I SAID THEM
IT'S A
CLEAN HAND NOW SHAKE IT DON'T BE AFEARD
SO THEY SHOOK IT ONE AFTER THE OTHER ALL AROUND AND CRIED
THE
JUDGE'S WIFE SHE KISSED IT
THEN THE OLD MAN HE SIGNED A PLEDGE MADE
HIS MARK
THE JUDGE SAID IT WAS THE HOLIEST TIME ON RECORD OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT
THEN THEY TUCKED THE OLD MAN INTO A BEAUTIFUL ROOM WHICH WAS
THE SPARE ROOM AND IN THE NIGHT SOME TIME HE GOT POWERFUL THIRSTY AND
CLUMB OUT ON TO THE PORCH ROOF AND SLID DOWN A STANCHION AND TRADED HIS
NEW COAT FOR A JUG OF FORTY ROD AND CLUMB BACK AGAIN AND HAD A GOOD OLD
TIME AND TOWARDS DAYLIGHT HE CRAWLED OUT AGAIN DRUNK AS A FIDDLER AND
ROLLED OFF THE PORCH AND BROKE HIS LEFT ARM IN TWO PLACES AND WAS MOST
FROZE TO DEATH WHEN SOMEBODY FOUND HIM AFTER SUN UP
AND WHEN THEY COME
TO LOOK AT THAT SPARE ROOM THEY HAD TO TAKE SOUNDINGS BEFORE THEY COULD
NAVIGATE IT
THE JUDGE HE FELT KIND OF SORE
HE SAID HE RECKONED A BODY COULD REFORM
THE OLD MAN WITH A SHOTGUN MAYBE BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW NO OTHER WAY
CHAPTER VI
WELL PRETTY SOON THE OLD MAN WAS UP AND AROUND AGAIN AND THEN HE WENT
FOR JUDGE THATCHER IN THE COURTS TO MAKE HIM GIVE UP THAT MONEY AND HE
WENT FOR ME TOO FOR NOT STOPPING SCHOOL
HE CATCHED ME A COUPLE OF
TIMES AND THRASHED ME BUT I WENT TO SCHOOL JUST THE SAME AND DODGED
HIM OR OUTRUN HIM MOST OF THE TIME
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL MUCH
BEFORE BUT I RECKONED I'D GO NOW TO SPITE PAP
THAT LAW TRIAL WAS A
SLOW BUSINESS APPEARED LIKE THEY WARN'T EVER GOING TO GET STARTED ON IT
SO EVERY NOW AND THEN I'D BORROW TWO OR THREE DOLLARS OFF OF THE JUDGE
FOR HIM TO KEEP FROM GETTING A COWHIDING
EVERY TIME HE GOT MONEY HE
GOT DRUNK AND EVERY TIME HE GOT DRUNK HE RAISED CAIN AROUND TOWN AND
EVERY TIME HE RAISED CAIN HE GOT JAILED
HE WAS JUST SUITED THIS KIND
OF THING WAS RIGHT IN HIS LINE
HE GOT TO HANGING AROUND THE WIDOW'S TOO MUCH AND SO SHE TOLD HIM AT
LAST THAT IF HE DIDN'T QUIT USING AROUND THERE SHE WOULD MAKE TROUBLE
FOR HIM
WELL WASN'T HE MAD HE SAID HE WOULD SHOW WHO WAS HUCK
FINN'S BOSS
SO HE WATCHED OUT FOR ME ONE DAY IN THE SPRING AND
CATCHED ME AND TOOK ME UP THE RIVER ABOUT THREE MILE IN A SKIFF AND
CROSSED OVER TO THE ILLINOIS SHORE WHERE IT WAS WOODY AND THERE WARN'T
NO HOUSES BUT AN OLD LOG HUT IN A PLACE WHERE THE TIMBER WAS SO THICK
YOU COULDN'T FIND IT IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS
HE KEPT ME WITH HIM ALL THE TIME AND I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO RUN OFF
WE LIVED IN THAT OLD CABIN AND HE ALWAYS LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE
KEY UNDER HIS HEAD NIGHTS
HE HAD A GUN WHICH HE HAD STOLE I RECKON
AND WE FISHED AND HUNTED AND THAT WAS WHAT WE LIVED ON
EVERY LITTLE
WHILE HE LOCKED ME IN AND WENT DOWN TO THE STORE THREE MILES TO THE
FERRY AND TRADED FISH AND GAME FOR WHISKY AND FETCHED IT HOME AND GOT
DRUNK AND HAD A GOOD TIME AND LICKED ME
THE WIDOW SHE FOUND OUT WHERE
I WAS BY AND BY AND SHE SENT A MAN OVER TO TRY TO GET HOLD OF ME BUT
PAP DROVE HIM OFF WITH THE GUN AND IT WARN'T LONG AFTER THAT TILL I WAS
USED TO BEING WHERE I WAS AND LIKED IT ALL BUT THE COWHIDE PART
IT WAS KIND OF LAZY AND JOLLY LAYING OFF COMFORTABLE ALL DAY SMOKING
AND FISHING AND NO BOOKS NOR STUDY
TWO MONTHS OR MORE RUN ALONG AND
MY CLOTHES GOT TO BE ALL RAGS AND DIRT AND I DIDN'T SEE HOW I'D EVER
GOT TO LIKE IT SO WELL AT THE WIDOW'S WHERE YOU HAD TO WASH AND EAT ON
A PLATE AND COMB UP AND GO TO BED AND GET UP REGULAR AND BE FOREVER
BOTHERING OVER A BOOK AND HAVE OLD MISS WATSON PECKING AT YOU ALL THE
TIME
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK NO MORE
I HAD STOPPED CUSSING BECAUSE
THE WIDOW DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT NOW I TOOK TO IT AGAIN BECAUSE PAP HADN'T
NO OBJECTIONS
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD TIMES UP IN THE WOODS THERE TAKE IT
ALL AROUND
BUT BY AND BY PAP GOT TOO HANDY WITH HIS HICK'RY AND I COULDN'T STAND
IT
I WAS ALL OVER WELTS
HE GOT TO GOING AWAY SO MUCH TOO AND
LOCKING ME IN
ONCE HE LOCKED ME IN AND WAS GONE THREE DAYS
IT WAS
DREADFUL LONESOME
I JUDGED HE HAD GOT DROWNDED AND I WASN'T EVER
GOING TO GET OUT ANY MORE
I WAS SCARED
I MADE UP MY MIND I WOULD FIX
UP SOME WAY TO LEAVE THERE
I HAD TRIED TO GET OUT OF THAT CABIN MANY
A TIME BUT I COULDN'T FIND NO WAY
THERE WARN'T A WINDOW TO IT BIG
ENOUGH FOR A DOG TO GET THROUGH
I COULDN'T GET UP THE CHIMBLY IT
WAS TOO NARROW
THE DOOR WAS THICK SOLID OAK SLABS
PAP WAS PRETTY
CAREFUL NOT TO LEAVE A KNIFE OR ANYTHING IN THE CABIN WHEN HE WAS AWAY
I RECKON I HAD HUNTED THE PLACE OVER AS MUCH AS A HUNDRED TIMES WELL I
WAS MOST ALL THE TIME AT IT BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT THE ONLY WAY TO PUT IN
THE TIME
BUT THIS TIME I FOUND SOMETHING AT LAST I FOUND AN OLD RUSTY
WOOD SAW WITHOUT ANY HANDLE IT WAS LAID IN BETWEEN A RAFTER AND THE
CLAPBOARDS OF THE ROOF
I GREASED IT UP AND WENT TO WORK
THERE WAS AN
OLD HORSE BLANKET NAILED AGAINST THE LOGS AT THE FAR END OF THE CABIN
BEHIND THE TABLE TO KEEP THE WIND FROM BLOWING THROUGH THE CHINKS AND
PUTTING THE CANDLE OUT
I GOT UNDER THE TABLE AND RAISED THE BLANKET
AND WENT TO WORK TO SAW A SECTION OF THE BIG BOTTOM LOG OUT BIG ENOUGH
TO LET ME THROUGH
WELL IT WAS A GOOD LONG JOB BUT I WAS GETTING
TOWARDS THE END OF IT WHEN I HEARD PAP'S GUN IN THE WOODS
I GOT RID OF
THE SIGNS OF MY WORK AND DROPPED THE BLANKET AND HID MY SAW AND PRETTY
SOON PAP COME IN
PAP WARN'T IN A GOOD HUMOR SO HE WAS HIS NATURAL SELF
HE SAID HE WAS
DOWN TOWN AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING WRONG
HIS LAWYER SAID HE RECKONED
HE WOULD WIN HIS LAWSUIT AND GET THE MONEY IF THEY EVER GOT STARTED ON
THE TRIAL BUT THEN THERE WAS WAYS TO PUT IT OFF A LONG TIME AND JUDGE
THATCHER KNOWED HOW TO DO IT
AND HE SAID PEOPLE ALLOWED THERE'D BE
ANOTHER TRIAL TO GET ME AWAY FROM HIM AND GIVE ME TO THE WIDOW FOR MY
GUARDIAN AND THEY GUESSED IT WOULD WIN THIS TIME
THIS SHOOK ME UP
CONSIDERABLE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WIDOW'S ANY MORE
AND BE SO CRAMPED UP AND SIVILIZED AS THEY CALLED IT
THEN THE OLD MAN
GOT TO CUSSING AND CUSSED EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY HE COULD THINK OF
AND THEN CUSSED THEM ALL OVER AGAIN TO MAKE SURE HE HADN'T SKIPPED ANY
AND AFTER THAT HE POLISHED OFF WITH A KIND OF A GENERAL CUSS ALL ROUND
INCLUDING A CONSIDERABLE PARCEL OF PEOPLE WHICH HE DIDN'T KNOW THE NAMES
OF AND SO CALLED THEM WHAT'S HIS NAME WHEN HE GOT TO THEM AND WENT
RIGHT ALONG WITH HIS CUSSING
HE SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE WIDOW GET ME
HE SAID HE WOULD WATCH
OUT AND IF THEY TRIED TO COME ANY SUCH GAME ON HIM HE KNOWED OF A PLACE
SIX OR SEVEN MILE OFF TO STOW ME IN WHERE THEY MIGHT HUNT TILL THEY
DROPPED AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ME
THAT MADE ME PRETTY UNEASY AGAIN
BUT ONLY FOR A MINUTE I RECKONED I WOULDN'T STAY ON HAND TILL HE GOT
THAT CHANCE
THE OLD MAN MADE ME GO TO THE SKIFF AND FETCH THE THINGS HE HAD
GOT
THERE WAS A FIFTY POUND SACK OF CORN MEAL AND A SIDE OF BACON
AMMUNITION AND A FOUR GALLON JUG OF WHISKY AND AN OLD BOOK AND TWO
NEWSPAPERS FOR WADDING BESIDES SOME TOW
I TOTED UP A LOAD AND WENT
BACK AND SET DOWN ON THE BOW OF THE SKIFF TO REST
I THOUGHT IT ALL
OVER AND I RECKONED I WOULD WALK OFF WITH THE GUN AND SOME LINES AND
TAKE TO THE WOODS WHEN I RUN AWAY
I GUESSED I WOULDN'T STAY IN ONE
PLACE BUT JUST TRAMP RIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY MOSTLY NIGHT TIMES AND
HUNT AND FISH TO KEEP ALIVE AND SO GET SO FAR AWAY THAT THE OLD MAN NOR
THE WIDOW COULDN'T EVER FIND ME ANY MORE
I JUDGED I WOULD SAW OUT AND
LEAVE THAT NIGHT IF PAP GOT DRUNK ENOUGH AND I RECKONED HE WOULD
I
GOT SO FULL OF IT I DIDN'T NOTICE HOW LONG I WAS STAYING TILL THE OLD
MAN HOLLERED AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WAS ASLEEP OR DROWNDED
I GOT THE THINGS ALL UP TO THE CABIN AND THEN IT WAS ABOUT DARK
WHILE
I WAS COOKING SUPPER THE OLD MAN TOOK A SWIG OR TWO AND GOT SORT OF
WARMED UP AND WENT TO RIPPING AGAIN
HE HAD BEEN DRUNK OVER IN TOWN
AND LAID IN THE GUTTER ALL NIGHT AND HE WAS A SIGHT TO LOOK AT
A BODY
WOULD A THOUGHT HE WAS ADAM HE WAS JUST ALL MUD
WHENEVER HIS LIQUOR
BEGUN TO WORK HE MOST ALWAYS WENT FOR THE GOVMENT THIS TIME HE SAYS
CALL THIS A GOVMENT WHY JUST LOOK AT IT AND SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
HERE'S THE LAW A STANDING READY TO TAKE A MAN'S SON AWAY FROM HIM A
MAN'S OWN SON WHICH HE HAS HAD ALL THE TROUBLE AND ALL THE ANXIETY

SON RAISED AT LAST AND READY TO GO TO WORK AND BEGIN TO DO SUTHIN' FOR
HIM AND GIVE HIM A REST THE LAW UP AND GOES FOR HIM
AND THEY CALL
THAT GOVMENT THAT AIN'T ALL NUTHER
THE LAW BACKS THAT OLD JUDGE
THATCHER UP AND HELPS HIM TO KEEP ME OUT O' MY PROPERTY
HERE'S WHAT
THE LAW DOES THE LAW TAKES A MAN WORTH SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND
UP'ARDS AND JAMS HIM INTO AN OLD TRAP OF A CABIN LIKE THIS AND LETS
HIM GO ROUND IN CLOTHES THAT AIN'T FITTEN FOR A HOG
THEY CALL THAT
GOVMENT A MAN CAN'T GET HIS RIGHTS IN A GOVMENT LIKE THIS
SOMETIMES
I'VE A MIGHTY NOTION TO JUST LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR GOOD AND ALL
YES
AND I TOLD 'EM SO I TOLD OLD THATCHER SO TO HIS FACE
LOTS OF 'EM
HEARD ME AND CAN TELL WHAT I SAID
SAYS I FOR TWO CENTS I'D LEAVE THE
BLAMED COUNTRY AND NEVER COME A NEAR IT AGIN
THEM'S THE VERY WORDS
I
SAYS LOOK AT MY HAT IF YOU CALL IT A HAT BUT THE LID RAISES UP AND THE
REST OF IT GOES DOWN TILL IT'S BELOW MY CHIN AND THEN IT AIN'T RIGHTLY
A HAT AT ALL BUT MORE LIKE MY HEAD WAS SHOVED UP THROUGH A JINT O'
STOVE PIPE
LOOK AT IT SAYS I SUCH A HAT FOR ME TO WEAR ONE OF THE
WEALTHIEST MEN IN THIS TOWN IF I COULD GIT MY RIGHTS
OH YES THIS IS A WONDERFUL GOVMENT WONDERFUL
WHY LOOKY HERE
THERE WAS A FREE NIGGER THERE FROM OHIO A MULATTER MOST AS WHITE AS
A WHITE MAN
HE HAD THE WHITEST SHIRT ON YOU EVER SEE TOO AND THE
SHINIEST HAT AND THERE AIN'T A MAN IN THAT TOWN THAT'S GOT AS FINE
CLOTHES AS WHAT HE HAD AND HE HAD A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN AND A
SILVER HEADED CANE THE AWFULEST OLD GRAY HEADED NABOB IN THE STATE
AND
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY SAID HE WAS A P'FESSOR IN A COLLEGE AND COULD
TALK ALL KINDS OF LANGUAGES AND KNOWED EVERYTHING
AND THAT AIN'T THE
WUST
THEY SAID HE COULD VOTE WHEN HE WAS AT HOME
WELL THAT LET ME
OUT
THINKS I WHAT IS THE COUNTRY A COMING TO IT WAS 'LECTION DAY
AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO AND VOTE MYSELF IF I WARN'T TOO DRUNK TO GET
THERE BUT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS A STATE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE
THEY'D LET THAT NIGGER VOTE I DRAWED OUT
I SAYS I'LL NEVER VOTE AGIN
THEM'S THE VERY WORDS I SAID THEY ALL HEARD ME AND THE COUNTRY MAY
ROT FOR ALL ME I'LL NEVER VOTE AGIN AS LONG AS I LIVE
AND TO SEE THE
COOL WAY OF THAT NIGGER WHY HE WOULDN'T A GIVE ME THE ROAD IF I HADN'T
SHOVED HIM OUT O' THE WAY
I SAYS TO THE PEOPLE WHY AIN'T THIS NIGGER
PUT UP AT AUCTION AND SOLD THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW
AND WHAT DO YOU
RECKON THEY SAID WHY THEY SAID HE COULDN'T BE SOLD TILL HE'D BEEN IN
THE STATE SIX MONTHS AND HE HADN'T BEEN THERE THAT LONG YET
THERE
NOW THAT'S A SPECIMEN
THEY CALL THAT A GOVMENT THAT CAN'T SELL A FREE
NIGGER TILL HE'S BEEN IN THE STATE SIX MONTHS
HERE'S A GOVMENT THAT
CALLS ITSELF A GOVMENT AND LETS ON TO BE A GOVMENT AND THINKS IT IS A
GOVMENT AND YET'S GOT TO SET STOCK STILL FOR SIX WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE
IT CAN TAKE A HOLD OF A PROWLING THIEVING INFERNAL WHITE SHIRTED FREE
NIGGER AND
PAP WAS AGOING ON SO HE NEVER NOTICED WHERE HIS OLD LIMBER LEGS WAS
TAKING HIM TO SO HE WENT HEAD OVER HEELS OVER THE TUB OF SALT PORK AND
BARKED BOTH SHINS AND THE REST OF HIS SPEECH WAS ALL THE HOTTEST KIND
OF LANGUAGE MOSTLY HOVE AT THE NIGGER AND THE GOVMENT THOUGH HE GIVE
THE TUB SOME TOO ALL ALONG HERE AND THERE
HE HOPPED AROUND THE
CABIN CONSIDERABLE FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER HOLDING
FIRST ONE SHIN AND THEN THE OTHER ONE AND AT LAST HE LET OUT WITH HIS
LEFT FOOT ALL OF A SUDDEN AND FETCHED THE TUB A RATTLING KICK
BUT IT
WARN'T GOOD JUDGMENT BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BOOT THAT HAD A COUPLE OF HIS
TOES LEAKING OUT OF THE FRONT END OF IT SO NOW HE RAISED A HOWL THAT
FAIRLY MADE A BODY'S HAIR RAISE AND DOWN HE WENT IN THE DIRT AND
ROLLED THERE AND HELD HIS TOES AND THE CUSSING HE DONE THEN LAID OVER
ANYTHING HE HAD EVER DONE PREVIOUS
HE SAID SO HIS OWN SELF AFTERWARDS
HE HAD HEARD OLD SOWBERRY HAGAN IN HIS BEST DAYS AND HE SAID IT LAID
OVER HIM TOO BUT I RECKON THAT WAS SORT OF PILING IT ON MAYBE
AFTER SUPPER PAP TOOK THE JUG AND SAID HE HAD ENOUGH WHISKY THERE
FOR TWO DRUNKS AND ONE DELIRIUM TREMENS
THAT WAS ALWAYS HIS WORD
I
JUDGED HE WOULD BE BLIND DRUNK IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN I WOULD STEAL
THE KEY OR SAW MYSELF OUT ONE OR T'OTHER
HE DRANK AND DRANK AND
TUMBLED DOWN ON HIS BLANKETS BY AND BY BUT LUCK DIDN'T RUN MY WAY
HE DIDN'T GO SOUND ASLEEP BUT WAS UNEASY
HE GROANED AND MOANED AND
THRASHED AROUND THIS WAY AND THAT FOR A LONG TIME
AT LAST I GOT SO
SLEEPY I COULDN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN ALL I COULD DO AND SO BEFORE I
KNOWED WHAT I WAS ABOUT I WAS SOUND ASLEEP AND THE CANDLE BURNING
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WAS ASLEEP BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS AN
AWFUL SCREAM AND I WAS UP
THERE WAS PAP LOOKING WILD AND SKIPPING
AROUND EVERY WHICH WAY AND YELLING ABOUT SNAKES
HE SAID THEY WAS
CRAWLING UP HIS LEGS AND THEN HE WOULD GIVE A JUMP AND SCREAM AND SAY
ONE HAD BIT HIM ON THE CHEEK BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO SNAKES
HE STARTED
AND RUN ROUND AND ROUND THE CABIN HOLLERING TAKE HIM OFF TAKE HIM
OFF HE'S BITING ME ON THE NECK I NEVER SEE A MAN LOOK SO WILD IN THE
EYES
PRETTY SOON HE WAS ALL FAGGED OUT AND FELL DOWN PANTING THEN HE
ROLLED OVER AND OVER WONDERFUL FAST KICKING THINGS EVERY WHICH WAY
AND STRIKING AND GRABBING AT THE AIR WITH HIS HANDS AND SCREAMING AND
SAYING THERE WAS DEVILS A HOLD OF HIM
HE WORE OUT BY AND BY AND LAID
STILL A WHILE MOANING
THEN HE LAID STILLER AND DIDN'T MAKE A SOUND
I COULD HEAR THE OWLS AND THE WOLVES AWAY OFF IN THE WOODS AND IT
SEEMED TERRIBLE STILL
HE WAS LAYING OVER BY THE CORNER
BY AND BY HE
RAISED UP PART WAY AND LISTENED WITH HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE
HE SAYS
VERY LOW
TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THAT'S THE DEAD TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THEY'RE COMING
AFTER ME BUT I WON'T GO
OH THEY'RE HERE DON'T TOUCH ME DON'T HANDS
OFF THEY'RE COLD LET GO
OH LET A POOR DEVIL ALONE
THEN HE WENT DOWN ON ALL FOURS AND CRAWLED OFF BEGGING THEM TO LET HIM
ALONE AND HE ROLLED HIMSELF UP IN HIS BLANKET AND WALLOWED IN UNDER THE
OLD PINE TABLE STILL A BEGGING AND THEN HE WENT TO CRYING
I COULD
HEAR HIM THROUGH THE BLANKET
BY AND BY HE ROLLED OUT AND JUMPED UP ON HIS FEET LOOKING WILD AND HE
SEE ME AND WENT FOR ME
HE CHASED ME ROUND AND ROUND THE PLACE WITH A
CLASP KNIFE CALLING ME THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND SAYING HE WOULD KILL ME
AND THEN I COULDN'T COME FOR HIM NO MORE
I BEGGED AND TOLD HIM I
WAS ONLY HUCK BUT HE LAUGHED SUCH A SCREECHY LAUGH AND ROARED AND
CUSSED AND KEPT ON CHASING ME UP
ONCE WHEN I TURNED SHORT AND
DODGED UNDER HIS ARM HE MADE A GRAB AND GOT ME BY THE JACKET BETWEEN MY
SHOULDERS AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONE BUT I SLID OUT OF THE JACKET QUICK
AS LIGHTNING AND SAVED MYSELF
PRETTY SOON HE WAS ALL TIRED OUT AND
DROPPED DOWN WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE DOOR AND SAID HE WOULD REST A
MINUTE AND THEN KILL ME
HE PUT HIS KNIFE UNDER HIM AND SAID HE WOULD
SLEEP AND GET STRONG AND THEN HE WOULD SEE WHO WAS WHO
SO HE DOZED OFF PRETTY SOON
BY AND BY I GOT THE OLD SPLIT BOTTOM CHAIR
AND CLUMB UP AS EASY AS I COULD NOT TO MAKE ANY NOISE AND GOT DOWN THE
GUN
I SLIPPED THE RAMROD DOWN IT TO MAKE SURE IT WAS LOADED THEN I
LAID IT ACROSS THE TURNIP BARREL POINTING TOWARDS PAP AND SET DOWN
BEHIND IT TO WAIT FOR HIM TO STIR
AND HOW SLOW AND STILL THE TIME DID
DRAG ALONG
CHAPTER VII
GIT UP WHAT YOU 'BOUT
I OPENED MY EYES AND LOOKED AROUND TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHERE I WAS
IT
WAS AFTER SUN UP AND I HAD BEEN SOUND ASLEEP
PAP WAS STANDING OVER ME
LOOKING SOUR AND SICK TOO
HE SAYS
WHAT YOU DOIN' WITH THIS GUN
I JUDGED HE DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING SO I SAYS
SOMEBODY TRIED TO GET IN SO I WAS LAYING FOR HIM
WHY DIDN'T YOU ROUST ME OUT
WELL I TRIED TO BUT I COULDN'T I COULDN'T BUDGE YOU
WELL ALL RIGHT
DON'T STAND THERE PALAVERING ALL DAY BUT OUT WITH
YOU AND SEE IF THERE'S A FISH ON THE LINES FOR BREAKFAST
I'LL BE ALONG
IN A MINUTE
HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND I CLEARED OUT UP THE RIVER BANK
I NOTICED
SOME PIECES OF LIMBS AND SUCH THINGS FLOATING DOWN AND A SPRINKLING OF
BARK SO I KNOWED THE RIVER HAD BEGUN TO RISE
I RECKONED I WOULD HAVE
GREAT TIMES NOW IF I WAS OVER AT THE TOWN
THE JUNE RISE USED TO BE
ALWAYS LUCK FOR ME BECAUSE AS SOON AS THAT RISE BEGINS HERE COMES
CORDWOOD FLOATING DOWN AND PIECES OF LOG RAFTS SOMETIMES A DOZEN LOGS
TOGETHER SO ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO CATCH THEM AND SELL THEM TO THE
WOOD YARDS AND THE SAWMILL
I WENT ALONG UP THE BANK WITH ONE EYE OUT FOR PAP AND T'OTHER ONE OUT
FOR WHAT THE RISE MIGHT FETCH ALONG
WELL ALL AT ONCE HERE COMES A
CANOE JUST A BEAUTY TOO ABOUT THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN FOOT LONG RIDING
HIGH LIKE A DUCK
I SHOT HEAD FIRST OFF OF THE BANK LIKE A FROG
CLOTHES AND ALL ON AND STRUCK OUT FOR THE CANOE
I JUST EXPECTED
THERE'D BE SOMEBODY LAYING DOWN IN IT BECAUSE PEOPLE OFTEN DONE THAT
TO FOOL FOLKS AND WHEN A CHAP HAD PULLED A SKIFF OUT MOST TO IT THEY'D
RAISE UP AND LAUGH AT HIM
BUT IT WARN'T SO THIS TIME
IT WAS A
DRIFT CANOE SURE ENOUGH AND I CLUMB IN AND PADDLED HER ASHORE
THINKS
I THE OLD MAN WILL BE GLAD WHEN HE SEES THIS SHE'S WORTH TEN DOLLARS
BUT WHEN I GOT TO SHORE PAP WASN'T IN SIGHT YET AND AS I WAS RUNNING
HER INTO A LITTLE CREEK LIKE A GULLY ALL HUNG OVER WITH VINES AND
WILLOWS I STRUCK ANOTHER IDEA I JUDGED I'D HIDE HER GOOD AND THEN
'STEAD OF TAKING TO THE WOODS WHEN I RUN OFF I'D GO DOWN THE RIVER
ABOUT FIFTY MILE AND CAMP IN ONE PLACE FOR GOOD AND NOT HAVE SUCH A
ROUGH TIME TRAMPING ON FOOT
IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE SHANTY AND I THOUGHT I HEARD THE OLD MAN
COMING ALL THE TIME BUT I GOT HER HID AND THEN I OUT AND LOOKED AROUND
A BUNCH OF WILLOWS AND THERE WAS THE OLD MAN DOWN THE PATH A PIECE JUST
DRAWING A BEAD ON A BIRD WITH HIS GUN
SO HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING
WHEN HE GOT ALONG I WAS HARD AT IT TAKING UP A TROT LINE
HE ABUSED
ME A LITTLE FOR BEING SO SLOW BUT I TOLD HIM I FELL IN THE RIVER AND
THAT WAS WHAT MADE ME SO LONG
I KNOWED HE WOULD SEE I WAS WET AND
THEN HE WOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS
WE GOT FIVE CATFISH OFF THE LINES
AND WENT HOME
WHILE WE LAID OFF AFTER BREAKFAST TO SLEEP UP BOTH OF US BEING ABOUT
WORE OUT I GOT TO THINKING THAT IF I COULD FIX UP SOME WAY TO KEEP PAP
AND THE WIDOW FROM TRYING TO FOLLOW ME IT WOULD BE A CERTAINER THING
THAN TRUSTING TO LUCK TO GET FAR ENOUGH OFF BEFORE THEY MISSED ME YOU
SEE ALL KINDS OF THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN
WELL I DIDN'T SEE NO WAY FOR A
WHILE BUT BY AND BY PAP RAISED UP A MINUTE TO DRINK ANOTHER BARREL OF
WATER AND HE SAYS
ANOTHER TIME A MAN COMES A PROWLING ROUND HERE YOU ROUST ME OUT YOU
HEAR THAT MAN WARN'T HERE FOR NO GOOD
I'D A SHOT HIM
NEXT TIME YOU
ROUST ME OUT YOU HEAR
THEN HE DROPPED DOWN AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN BUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN
SAYING GIVE ME THE VERY IDEA I WANTED
I SAYS TO MYSELF I CAN FIX IT
NOW SO NOBODY WON'T THINK OF FOLLOWING ME
ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK WE TURNED OUT AND WENT ALONG UP THE BANK
THE
RIVER WAS COMING UP PRETTY FAST AND LOTS OF DRIFTWOOD GOING BY ON THE
RISE
BY AND BY ALONG COMES PART OF A LOG RAFT NINE LOGS FAST TOGETHER
WE WENT OUT WITH THE SKIFF AND TOWED IT ASHORE
THEN WE HAD DINNER
ANYBODY BUT PAP WOULD A WAITED AND SEEN THE DAY THROUGH SO AS TO CATCH
MORE STUFF BUT THAT WARN'T PAP'S STYLE
NINE LOGS WAS ENOUGH FOR ONE
TIME HE MUST SHOVE RIGHT OVER TO TOWN AND SELL
SO HE LOCKED ME IN AND
TOOK THE SKIFF AND STARTED OFF TOWING THE RAFT ABOUT HALF PAST THREE
I JUDGED HE WOULDN'T COME BACK THAT NIGHT
I WAITED TILL I RECKONED HE
HAD GOT A GOOD START THEN I OUT WITH MY SAW AND WENT TO WORK ON THAT
LOG AGAIN
BEFORE HE WAS T'OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER I WAS OUT OF THE
HOLE HIM AND HIS RAFT WAS JUST A SPECK ON THE WATER AWAY OFF YONDER
I TOOK THE SACK OF CORN MEAL AND TOOK IT TO WHERE THE CANOE WAS HID AND
SHOVED THE VINES AND BRANCHES APART AND PUT IT IN THEN I DONE THE SAME
WITH THE SIDE OF BACON THEN THE WHISKY JUG
I TOOK ALL THE COFFEE AND
SUGAR THERE WAS AND ALL THE AMMUNITION I TOOK THE WADDING I TOOK THE
BUCKET AND GOURD I TOOK A DIPPER AND A TIN CUP AND MY OLD SAW AND TWO
BLANKETS AND THE SKILLET AND THE COFFEE POT
I TOOK FISH LINES AND
MATCHES AND OTHER THINGS EVERYTHING THAT WAS WORTH A CENT
I CLEANED
OUT THE PLACE
I WANTED AN AXE BUT THERE WASN'T ANY ONLY THE ONE OUT
AT THE WOODPILE AND I KNOWED WHY I WAS GOING TO LEAVE THAT
I FETCHED
OUT THE GUN AND NOW I WAS DONE
I HAD WORE THE GROUND A GOOD DEAL CRAWLING OUT OF THE HOLE AND DRAGGING
OUT SO MANY THINGS
SO I FIXED THAT AS GOOD AS I COULD FROM THE OUTSIDE
BY SCATTERING DUST ON THE PLACE WHICH COVERED UP THE SMOOTHNESS AND THE
SAWDUST
THEN I FIXED THE PIECE OF LOG BACK INTO ITS PLACE AND PUT TWO
ROCKS UNDER IT AND ONE AGAINST IT TO HOLD IT THERE FOR IT WAS BENT UP
AT THAT PLACE AND DIDN'T QUITE TOUCH GROUND
IF YOU STOOD FOUR OR FIVE
FOOT AWAY AND DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS SAWED YOU WOULDN'T NEVER NOTICE
IT AND BESIDES THIS WAS THE BACK OF THE CABIN AND IT WARN'T LIKELY
ANYBODY WOULD GO FOOLING AROUND THERE
IT WAS ALL GRASS CLEAR TO THE CANOE SO I HADN'T LEFT A TRACK
I
FOLLOWED AROUND TO SEE
I STOOD ON THE BANK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE
RIVER
ALL SAFE
SO I TOOK THE GUN AND WENT UP A PIECE INTO THE WOODS
AND WAS HUNTING AROUND FOR SOME BIRDS WHEN I SEE A WILD PIG HOGS SOON
WENT WILD IN THEM BOTTOMS AFTER THEY HAD GOT AWAY FROM THE PRAIRIE
FARMS
I SHOT THIS FELLOW AND TOOK HIM INTO CAMP
I TOOK THE AXE AND SMASHED IN THE DOOR
I BEAT IT AND HACKED IT
CONSIDERABLE A DOING IT
I FETCHED THE PIG IN AND TOOK HIM BACK NEARLY
TO THE TABLE AND HACKED INTO HIS THROAT WITH THE AXE AND LAID HIM DOWN
ON THE GROUND TO BLEED I SAY GROUND BECAUSE IT WAS GROUND HARD PACKED
AND NO BOARDS
WELL NEXT I TOOK AN OLD SACK AND PUT A LOT OF BIG ROCKS
IN IT ALL I COULD DRAG AND I STARTED IT FROM THE PIG AND DRAGGED IT TO
THE DOOR AND THROUGH THE WOODS DOWN TO THE RIVER AND DUMPED IT IN AND
DOWN IT SUNK OUT OF SIGHT
YOU COULD EASY SEE THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN
DRAGGED OVER THE GROUND
I DID WISH TOM SAWYER WAS THERE I KNOWED HE
WOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN THIS KIND OF BUSINESS AND THROW IN THE FANCY
TOUCHES
NOBODY COULD SPREAD HIMSELF LIKE TOM SAWYER IN SUCH A THING AS
THAT
WELL LAST I PULLED OUT SOME OF MY HAIR AND BLOODED THE AXE GOOD AND
STUCK IT ON THE BACK SIDE AND SLUNG THE AXE IN THE CORNER
THEN I
TOOK UP THE PIG AND HELD HIM TO MY BREAST WITH MY JACKET SO HE COULDN'T
DRIP TILL I GOT A GOOD PIECE BELOW THE HOUSE AND THEN DUMPED HIM INTO
THE RIVER
NOW I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ELSE
SO I WENT AND GOT THE BAG
OF MEAL AND MY OLD SAW OUT OF THE CANOE AND FETCHED THEM TO THE HOUSE
I TOOK THE BAG TO WHERE IT USED TO STAND AND RIPPED A HOLE IN THE
BOTTOM OF IT WITH THE SAW FOR THERE WARN'T NO KNIVES AND FORKS ON THE
PLACE PAP DONE EVERYTHING WITH HIS CLASP KNIFE ABOUT THE COOKING
THEN
I CARRIED THE SACK ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS ACROSS THE GRASS AND THROUGH
THE WILLOWS EAST OF THE HOUSE TO A SHALLOW LAKE THAT WAS FIVE MILE WIDE
AND FULL OF RUSHES AND DUCKS TOO YOU MIGHT SAY IN THE SEASON
THERE
WAS A SLOUGH OR A CREEK LEADING OUT OF IT ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT WENT
MILES AWAY I DON'T KNOW WHERE BUT IT DIDN'T GO TO THE RIVER
THE MEAL
SIFTED OUT AND MADE A LITTLE TRACK ALL THE WAY TO THE LAKE
I DROPPED
PAP'S WHETSTONE THERE TOO SO AS TO LOOK LIKE IT HAD BEEN DONE BY
ACCIDENT
THEN I TIED UP THE RIP IN THE MEAL SACK WITH A STRING SO IT
WOULDN'T LEAK NO MORE AND TOOK IT AND MY SAW TO THE CANOE AGAIN
IT WAS ABOUT DARK NOW SO I DROPPED THE CANOE DOWN THE RIVER UNDER SOME
WILLOWS THAT HUNG OVER THE BANK AND WAITED FOR THE MOON TO RISE
I
MADE FAST TO A WILLOW THEN I TOOK A BITE TO EAT AND BY AND BY LAID
DOWN IN THE CANOE TO SMOKE A PIPE AND LAY OUT A PLAN
I SAYS TO MYSELF
THEY'LL FOLLOW THE TRACK OF THAT SACKFUL OF ROCKS TO THE SHORE AND THEN
DRAG THE RIVER FOR ME
AND THEY'LL FOLLOW THAT MEAL TRACK TO THE LAKE
AND GO BROWSING DOWN THE CREEK THAT LEADS OUT OF IT TO FIND THE ROBBERS
THAT KILLED ME AND TOOK THE THINGS
THEY WON'T EVER HUNT THE RIVER FOR
ANYTHING BUT MY DEAD CARCASS
THEY'LL SOON GET TIRED OF THAT AND WON'T
BOTHER NO MORE ABOUT ME
ALL RIGHT I CAN STOP ANYWHERE I WANT TO
JACKSON'S ISLAND IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME I KNOW THAT ISLAND PRETTY WELL
AND NOBODY EVER COMES THERE
AND THEN I CAN PADDLE OVER TO TOWN NIGHTS
AND SLINK AROUND AND PICK UP THINGS I WANT
JACKSON'S ISLAND'S THE
PLACE
I WAS PRETTY TIRED AND THE FIRST THING I KNOWED I WAS ASLEEP
WHEN
I WOKE UP I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS FOR A MINUTE
I SET UP AND LOOKED
AROUND A LITTLE SCARED
THEN I REMEMBERED
THE RIVER LOOKED MILES AND
MILES ACROSS
THE MOON WAS SO BRIGHT I COULD A COUNTED THE DRIFT LOGS
THAT WENT A SLIPPING ALONG BLACK AND STILL HUNDREDS OF YARDS OUT FROM
SHORE
EVERYTHING WAS DEAD QUIET AND IT LOOKED LATE AND SMELT LATE
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN I DON'T KNOW THE WORDS TO PUT IT IN
I TOOK A GOOD GAP AND A STRETCH AND WAS JUST GOING TO UNHITCH AND START
WHEN I HEARD A SOUND AWAY OVER THE WATER
I LISTENED
PRETTY SOON I
MADE IT OUT
IT WAS THAT DULL KIND OF A REGULAR SOUND THAT COMES FROM
OARS WORKING IN ROWLOCKS WHEN IT'S A STILL NIGHT
I PEEPED OUT THROUGH
THE WILLOW BRANCHES AND THERE IT WAS A SKIFF AWAY ACROSS THE WATER
I COULDN'T TELL HOW MANY WAS IN IT
IT KEPT A COMING AND WHEN IT WAS
ABREAST OF ME I SEE THERE WARN'T BUT ONE MAN IN IT
THINK'S I MAYBE
IT'S PAP THOUGH I WARN'T EXPECTING HIM
HE DROPPED BELOW ME WITH THE
CURRENT AND BY AND BY HE CAME A SWINGING UP SHORE IN THE EASY WATER
AND HE WENT BY SO CLOSE I COULD A REACHED OUT THE GUN AND TOUCHED HIM
WELL IT WAS PAP SURE ENOUGH AND SOBER TOO BY THE WAY HE LAID HIS
OARS
I DIDN'T LOSE NO TIME
THE NEXT MINUTE I WAS A SPINNING DOWN STREAM
SOFT BUT QUICK IN THE SHADE OF THE BANK
I MADE TWO MILE AND A HALF
AND THEN STRUCK OUT A QUARTER OF A MILE OR MORE TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF
THE RIVER BECAUSE PRETTY SOON I WOULD BE PASSING THE FERRY LANDING AND
PEOPLE MIGHT SEE ME AND HAIL ME
I GOT OUT AMONGST THE DRIFTWOOD AND
THEN LAID DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CANOE AND LET HER FLOAT
I LAID THERE AND HAD A GOOD REST AND A SMOKE OUT OF MY PIPE LOOKING
AWAY INTO THE SKY NOT A CLOUD IN IT
THE SKY LOOKS EVER SO DEEP WHEN
YOU LAY DOWN ON YOUR BACK IN THE MOONSHINE I NEVER KNOWED IT BEFORE
AND HOW FAR A BODY CAN HEAR ON THE WATER SUCH NIGHTS I HEARD PEOPLE
TALKING AT THE FERRY LANDING
I HEARD WHAT THEY SAID TOO EVERY WORD
OF IT
ONE MAN SAID IT WAS GETTING TOWARDS THE LONG DAYS AND THE SHORT
NIGHTS NOW
T'OTHER ONE SAID THIS WARN'T ONE OF THE SHORT ONES HE
RECKONED AND THEN THEY LAUGHED AND HE SAID IT OVER AGAIN AND THEY
LAUGHED AGAIN THEN THEY WAKED UP ANOTHER FELLOW AND TOLD HIM AND
LAUGHED BUT HE DIDN'T LAUGH HE RIPPED OUT SOMETHING BRISK AND SAID
LET HIM ALONE
THE FIRST FELLOW SAID HE 'LOWED TO TELL IT TO HIS
OLD WOMAN SHE WOULD THINK IT WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT HE SAID THAT WARN'T
NOTHING TO SOME THINGS HE HAD SAID IN HIS TIME
I HEARD ONE MAN SAY IT
WAS NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK AND HE HOPED DAYLIGHT WOULDN'T WAIT MORE THAN
ABOUT A WEEK LONGER
AFTER THAT THE TALK GOT FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY
AND I COULDN'T MAKE OUT THE WORDS ANY MORE BUT I COULD HEAR THE MUMBLE
AND NOW AND THEN A LAUGH TOO BUT IT SEEMED A LONG WAYS OFF
I WAS AWAY BELOW THE FERRY NOW
I ROSE UP AND THERE WAS JACKSON'S
ISLAND ABOUT TWO MILE AND A HALF DOWN STREAM HEAVY TIMBERED AND
STANDING UP OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER BIG AND DARK AND SOLID LIKE
A STEAMBOAT WITHOUT ANY LIGHTS
THERE WARN'T ANY SIGNS OF THE BAR AT
THE HEAD IT WAS ALL UNDER WATER NOW
IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO GET THERE
I SHOT PAST THE HEAD AT A RIPPING
RATE THE CURRENT WAS SO SWIFT AND THEN I GOT INTO THE DEAD WATER AND
LANDED ON THE SIDE TOWARDS THE ILLINOIS SHORE
I RUN THE CANOE INTO
A DEEP DENT IN THE BANK THAT I KNOWED ABOUT I HAD TO PART THE WILLOW
BRANCHES TO GET IN AND WHEN I MADE FAST NOBODY COULD A SEEN THE CANOE
FROM THE OUTSIDE
I WENT UP AND SET DOWN ON A LOG AT THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND AND LOOKED
OUT ON THE BIG RIVER AND THE BLACK DRIFTWOOD AND AWAY OVER TO THE TOWN
THREE MILE AWAY WHERE THERE WAS THREE OR FOUR LIGHTS TWINKLING
A
MONSTROUS BIG LUMBER RAFT WAS ABOUT A MILE UP STREAM COMING ALONG DOWN
WITH A LANTERN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
I WATCHED IT COME CREEPING DOWN
AND WHEN IT WAS MOST ABREAST OF WHERE I STOOD I HEARD A MAN SAY STERN
OARS THERE HEAVE HER HEAD TO STABBOARD I HEARD THAT JUST AS PLAIN
AS IF THE MAN WAS BY MY SIDE
THERE WAS A LITTLE GRAY IN THE SKY NOW SO I STEPPED INTO THE WOODS AND
LAID DOWN FOR A NAP BEFORE BREAKFAST
CHAPTER VIII
THE SUN WAS UP SO HIGH WHEN I WAKED THAT I JUDGED IT WAS AFTER EIGHT
O'CLOCK
I LAID THERE IN THE GRASS AND THE COOL SHADE THINKING ABOUT
THINGS AND FEELING RESTED AND RUTHER COMFORTABLE AND SATISFIED
I
COULD SEE THE SUN OUT AT ONE OR TWO HOLES BUT MOSTLY IT WAS BIG TREES
ALL ABOUT AND GLOOMY IN THERE AMONGST THEM
THERE WAS FRECKLED PLACES
ON THE GROUND WHERE THE LIGHT SIFTED DOWN THROUGH THE LEAVES AND THE
FRECKLED PLACES SWAPPED ABOUT A LITTLE SHOWING THERE WAS A LITTLE
BREEZE UP THERE
A COUPLE OF SQUIRRELS SET ON A LIMB AND JABBERED AT ME
VERY FRIENDLY
I WAS POWERFUL LAZY AND COMFORTABLE DIDN'T WANT TO GET UP AND COOK
BREAKFAST
WELL I WAS DOZING OFF AGAIN WHEN I THINKS I HEARS A DEEP
SOUND OF BOOM AWAY UP THE RIVER
I ROUSES UP AND RESTS ON MY ELBOW
AND LISTENS PRETTY SOON I HEARS IT AGAIN
I HOPPED UP AND WENT AND
LOOKED OUT AT A HOLE IN THE LEAVES AND I SEE A BUNCH OF SMOKE LAYING
ON THE WATER A LONG WAYS UP ABOUT ABREAST THE FERRY
AND THERE WAS THE
FERRYBOAT FULL OF PEOPLE FLOATING ALONG DOWN
I KNOWED WHAT WAS THE
MATTER NOW
BOOM I SEE THE WHITE SMOKE SQUIRT OUT OF THE FERRYBOAT'S
SIDE
YOU SEE THEY WAS FIRING CANNON OVER THE WATER TRYING TO MAKE MY
CARCASS COME TO THE TOP
I WAS PRETTY HUNGRY BUT IT WARN'T GOING TO DO FOR ME TO START A FIRE
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT SEE THE SMOKE
SO I SET THERE AND WATCHED THE
CANNON SMOKE AND LISTENED TO THE BOOM
THE RIVER WAS A MILE WIDE THERE
AND IT ALWAYS LOOKS PRETTY ON A SUMMER MORNING SO I WAS HAVING A GOOD
ENOUGH TIME SEEING THEM HUNT FOR MY REMAINDERS IF I ONLY HAD A BITE TO
EAT
WELL THEN I HAPPENED TO THINK HOW THEY ALWAYS PUT QUICKSILVER IN
LOAVES OF BREAD AND FLOAT THEM OFF BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS GO RIGHT TO THE
DROWNDED CARCASS AND STOP THERE
SO SAYS I I'LL KEEP A LOOKOUT AND
IF ANY OF THEM'S FLOATING AROUND AFTER ME I'LL GIVE THEM A SHOW
I
CHANGED TO THE ILLINOIS EDGE OF THE ISLAND TO SEE WHAT LUCK I COULD
HAVE AND I WARN'T DISAPPOINTED
A BIG DOUBLE LOAF COME ALONG AND I
MOST GOT IT WITH A LONG STICK BUT MY FOOT SLIPPED AND SHE FLOATED OUT
FURTHER
OF COURSE I WAS WHERE THE CURRENT SET IN THE CLOSEST TO THE
SHORE I KNOWED ENOUGH FOR THAT
BUT BY AND BY ALONG COMES ANOTHER ONE
AND THIS TIME I WON
I TOOK OUT THE PLUG AND SHOOK OUT THE LITTLE DAB
OF QUICKSILVER AND SET MY TEETH IN
IT WAS BAKER'S BREAD WHAT THE
QUALITY EAT NONE OF YOUR LOW DOWN CORN PONE
I GOT A GOOD PLACE AMONGST THE LEAVES AND SET THERE ON A LOG MUNCHING
THE BREAD AND WATCHING THE FERRY BOAT AND VERY WELL SATISFIED
AND
THEN SOMETHING STRUCK ME
I SAYS NOW I RECKON THE WIDOW OR THE PARSON
OR SOMEBODY PRAYED THAT THIS BREAD WOULD FIND ME AND HERE IT HAS GONE
AND DONE IT
SO THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT BUT THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT
THING THAT IS THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT WHEN A BODY LIKE THE WIDOW OR THE
PARSON PRAYS BUT IT DON'T WORK FOR ME AND I RECKON IT DON'T WORK FOR
ONLY JUST THE RIGHT KIND
I LIT A PIPE AND HAD A GOOD LONG SMOKE AND WENT ON WATCHING
THE
FERRYBOAT WAS FLOATING WITH THE CURRENT AND I ALLOWED I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO SEE WHO WAS ABOARD WHEN SHE COME ALONG BECAUSE SHE WOULD COME IN
CLOSE WHERE THE BREAD DID
WHEN SHE'D GOT PRETTY WELL ALONG DOWN
TOWARDS ME I PUT OUT MY PIPE AND WENT TO WHERE I FISHED OUT THE BREAD
AND LAID DOWN BEHIND A LOG ON THE BANK IN A LITTLE OPEN PLACE
WHERE
THE LOG FORKED I COULD PEEP THROUGH
BY AND BY SHE COME ALONG AND SHE DRIFTED IN SO CLOSE THAT THEY COULD
A RUN OUT A PLANK AND WALKED ASHORE
MOST EVERYBODY WAS ON THE BOAT
PAP AND JUDGE THATCHER AND BESSIE THATCHER AND JO HARPER AND TOM
SAWYER AND HIS OLD AUNT POLLY AND SID AND MARY AND PLENTY MORE
EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE MURDER BUT THE CAPTAIN BROKE IN AND
SAYS
LOOK SHARP NOW THE CURRENT SETS IN THE CLOSEST HERE AND MAYBE HE'S
WASHED ASHORE AND GOT TANGLED AMONGST THE BRUSH AT THE WATER'S EDGE
I
HOPE SO ANYWAY
I DIDN'T HOPE SO
THEY ALL CROWDED UP AND LEANED OVER THE RAILS NEARLY
IN MY FACE AND KEPT STILL WATCHING WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
I COULD SEE
THEM FIRST RATE BUT THEY COULDN'T SEE ME
THEN THE CAPTAIN SUNG OUT
STAND AWAY AND THE CANNON LET OFF SUCH A BLAST RIGHT BEFORE ME THAT
IT MADE ME DEEF WITH THE NOISE AND PRETTY NEAR BLIND WITH THE SMOKE AND
I JUDGED I WAS GONE
IF THEY'D A HAD SOME BULLETS IN I RECKON THEY'D
A GOT THE CORPSE THEY WAS AFTER
WELL I SEE I WARN'T HURT THANKS TO
GOODNESS
THE BOAT FLOATED ON AND WENT OUT OF SIGHT AROUND THE SHOULDER
OF THE ISLAND
I COULD HEAR THE BOOMING NOW AND THEN FURTHER AND
FURTHER OFF AND BY AND BY AFTER AN HOUR I DIDN'T HEAR IT NO MORE
THE ISLAND WAS THREE MILE LONG
I JUDGED THEY HAD GOT TO THE FOOT AND
WAS GIVING IT UP
BUT THEY DIDN'T YET A WHILE
THEY TURNED AROUND
THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND AND STARTED UP THE CHANNEL ON THE MISSOURI SIDE
UNDER STEAM AND BOOMING ONCE IN A WHILE AS THEY WENT
I CROSSED OVER
TO THAT SIDE AND WATCHED THEM
WHEN THEY GOT ABREAST THE HEAD OF THE
ISLAND THEY QUIT SHOOTING AND DROPPED OVER TO THE MISSOURI SHORE AND
WENT HOME TO THE TOWN
I KNOWED I WAS ALL RIGHT NOW
NOBODY ELSE WOULD COME A HUNTING AFTER
ME
I GOT MY TRAPS OUT OF THE CANOE AND MADE ME A NICE CAMP IN THE THICK
WOODS
I MADE A KIND OF A TENT OUT OF MY BLANKETS TO PUT MY THINGS
UNDER SO THE RAIN COULDN'T GET AT THEM
I CATCHED A CATFISH AND HAGGLED
HIM OPEN WITH MY SAW AND TOWARDS SUNDOWN I STARTED MY CAMP FIRE AND HAD
SUPPER
THEN I SET OUT A LINE TO CATCH SOME FISH FOR BREAKFAST
WHEN IT WAS DARK I SET BY MY CAMP FIRE SMOKING AND FEELING PRETTY WELL
SATISFIED BUT BY AND BY IT GOT SORT OF LONESOME AND SO I WENT AND SET
ON THE BANK AND LISTENED TO THE CURRENT SWASHING ALONG AND COUNTED THE
STARS AND DRIFT LOGS AND RAFTS THAT COME DOWN AND THEN WENT TO BED
THERE AIN'T NO BETTER WAY TO PUT IN TIME WHEN YOU ARE LONESOME YOU
CAN'T STAY SO YOU SOON GET OVER IT
AND SO FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS
NO DIFFERENCE JUST THE SAME THING
BUT THE NEXT DAY I WENT EXPLORING AROUND DOWN THROUGH THE ISLAND
I WAS
BOSS OF IT IT ALL BELONGED TO ME SO TO SAY AND I WANTED TO KNOW
ALL ABOUT IT BUT MAINLY I WANTED TO PUT IN THE TIME
I FOUND PLENTY
STRAWBERRIES RIPE AND PRIME AND GREEN SUMMER GRAPES AND GREEN
RAZBERRIES AND THE GREEN BLACKBERRIES WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW
THEY
WOULD ALL COME HANDY BY AND BY I JUDGED
WELL I WENT FOOLING ALONG IN THE DEEP WOODS TILL I JUDGED I WARN'T
FAR FROM THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND
I HAD MY GUN ALONG BUT I HADN'T SHOT
NOTHING IT WAS FOR PROTECTION THOUGHT I WOULD KILL SOME GAME NIGH
HOME
ABOUT THIS TIME I MIGHTY NEAR STEPPED ON A GOOD SIZED SNAKE
AND IT WENT SLIDING OFF THROUGH THE GRASS AND FLOWERS AND I AFTER
IT TRYING TO GET A SHOT AT IT
I CLIPPED ALONG AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I
BOUNDED RIGHT ON TO THE ASHES OF A CAMP FIRE THAT WAS STILL SMOKING
MY HEART JUMPED UP AMONGST MY LUNGS
I NEVER WAITED FOR TO LOOK
FURTHER BUT UNCOCKED MY GUN AND WENT SNEAKING BACK ON MY TIPTOES AS
FAST AS EVER I COULD
EVERY NOW AND THEN I STOPPED A SECOND AMONGST THE
THICK LEAVES AND LISTENED BUT MY BREATH COME SO HARD I COULDN'T HEAR
NOTHING ELSE
I SLUNK ALONG ANOTHER PIECE FURTHER THEN LISTENED AGAIN
AND SO ON AND SO ON
IF I SEE A STUMP I TOOK IT FOR A MAN IF I TROD
ON A STICK AND BROKE IT IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE A PERSON HAD CUT ONE OF MY
BREATHS IN TWO AND I ONLY GOT HALF AND THE SHORT HALF TOO
WHEN I GOT TO CAMP I WARN'T FEELING VERY BRASH THERE WARN'T MUCH SAND
IN MY CRAW BUT I SAYS THIS AIN'T NO TIME TO BE FOOLING AROUND
SO I
GOT ALL MY TRAPS INTO MY CANOE AGAIN SO AS TO HAVE THEM OUT OF SIGHT
AND I PUT OUT THE FIRE AND SCATTERED THE ASHES AROUND TO LOOK LIKE AN
OLD LAST YEAR'S CAMP AND THEN CLUMB A TREE
I RECKON I WAS UP IN THE TREE TWO HOURS BUT I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING
I DIDN'T HEAR NOTHING I ONLY THOUGHT I HEARD AND SEEN AS MUCH AS A
THOUSAND THINGS
WELL I COULDN'T STAY UP THERE FOREVER SO AT LAST I
GOT DOWN BUT I KEPT IN THE THICK WOODS AND ON THE LOOKOUT ALL THE
TIME
ALL I COULD GET TO EAT WAS BERRIES AND WHAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM
BREAKFAST
BY THE TIME IT WAS NIGHT I WAS PRETTY HUNGRY
SO WHEN IT WAS GOOD
AND DARK I SLID OUT FROM SHORE BEFORE MOONRISE AND PADDLED OVER TO THE
ILLINOIS BANK ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE
I WENT OUT IN THE WOODS AND
COOKED A SUPPER AND I HAD ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND I WOULD STAY THERE
ALL NIGHT WHEN I HEAR A PLUNKETY PLUNK PLUNKETY PLUNK AND SAYS
TO MYSELF HORSES COMING AND NEXT I HEAR PEOPLE'S VOICES
I GOT
EVERYTHING INTO THE CANOE AS QUICK AS I COULD AND THEN WENT CREEPING
THROUGH THE WOODS TO SEE WHAT I COULD FIND OUT
I HADN'T GOT FAR WHEN I
HEAR A MAN SAY
WE BETTER CAMP HERE IF WE CAN FIND A GOOD PLACE THE HORSES IS ABOUT
BEAT OUT
LET'S LOOK AROUND
I DIDN'T WAIT BUT SHOVED OUT AND PADDLED AWAY EASY
I TIED UP IN THE
OLD PLACE AND RECKONED I WOULD SLEEP IN THE CANOE
I DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH
I COULDN'T SOMEHOW FOR THINKING
AND EVERY TIME
I WAKED UP I THOUGHT SOMEBODY HAD ME BY THE NECK
SO THE SLEEP DIDN'T
DO ME NO GOOD
BY AND BY I SAYS TO MYSELF I CAN'T LIVE THIS WAY I'M
A GOING TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS THAT'S HERE ON THE ISLAND WITH ME I'LL
FIND IT OUT OR BUST
WELL I FELT BETTER RIGHT OFF
SO I TOOK MY PADDLE AND SLID OUT FROM SHORE JUST A STEP OR TWO AND
THEN LET THE CANOE DROP ALONG DOWN AMONGST THE SHADOWS
THE MOON WAS
SHINING AND OUTSIDE OF THE SHADOWS IT MADE IT MOST AS LIGHT AS DAY
I POKED ALONG WELL ON TO AN HOUR EVERYTHING STILL AS ROCKS AND SOUND
ASLEEP
WELL BY THIS TIME I WAS MOST DOWN TO THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND
A
LITTLE RIPPLY COOL BREEZE BEGUN TO BLOW AND THAT WAS AS GOOD AS SAYING
THE NIGHT WAS ABOUT DONE
I GIVE HER A TURN WITH THE PADDLE AND BRUNG
HER NOSE TO SHORE THEN I GOT MY GUN AND SLIPPED OUT AND INTO THE EDGE
OF THE WOODS
I SAT DOWN THERE ON A LOG AND LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE
LEAVES
I SEE THE MOON GO OFF WATCH AND THE DARKNESS BEGIN TO BLANKET
THE RIVER
BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE I SEE A PALE STREAK OVER THE TREETOPS
AND KNOWED THE DAY WAS COMING
SO I TOOK MY GUN AND SLIPPED OFF TOWARDS
WHERE I HAD RUN ACROSS THAT CAMP FIRE STOPPING EVERY MINUTE OR TWO
TO LISTEN
BUT I HADN'T NO LUCK SOMEHOW I COULDN'T SEEM TO FIND THE
PLACE
BUT BY AND BY SURE ENOUGH I CATCHED A GLIMPSE OF FIRE AWAY
THROUGH THE TREES
I WENT FOR IT CAUTIOUS AND SLOW
BY AND BY I WAS
CLOSE ENOUGH TO HAVE A LOOK AND THERE LAID A MAN ON THE GROUND
IT
MOST GIVE ME THE FAN TODS
HE HAD A BLANKET AROUND HIS HEAD AND HIS
HEAD WAS NEARLY IN THE FIRE
I SET THERE BEHIND A CLUMP OF BUSHES IN
ABOUT SIX FOOT OF HIM AND KEPT MY EYES ON HIM STEADY
IT WAS GETTING
GRAY DAYLIGHT NOW
PRETTY SOON HE GAPPED AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AND HOVE
OFF THE BLANKET AND IT WAS MISS WATSON'S JIM I BET I WAS GLAD TO SEE
HIM
I SAYS
HELLO JIM AND SKIPPED OUT
HE BOUNCED UP AND STARED AT ME WILD
THEN HE DROPS DOWN ON HIS KNEES
AND PUTS HIS HANDS TOGETHER AND SAYS

CHAPTER IX
I WANTED TO GO AND LOOK AT A PLACE RIGHT ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND
THAT I'D FOUND WHEN I WAS EXPLORING SO WE STARTED AND SOON GOT TO IT
BECAUSE THE ISLAND WAS ONLY THREE MILES LONG AND A QUARTER OF A MILE
WIDE
THIS PLACE WAS A TOLERABLE LONG STEEP HILL OR RIDGE ABOUT FORTY FOOT
HIGH
WE HAD A ROUGH TIME GETTING TO THE TOP THE SIDES WAS SO STEEP AND
THE BUSHES SO THICK
WE TRAMPED AND CLUMB AROUND ALL OVER IT AND BY
AND BY FOUND A GOOD BIG CAVERN IN THE ROCK MOST UP TO THE TOP ON THE
SIDE TOWARDS ILLINOIS
THE CAVERN WAS AS BIG AS TWO OR THREE ROOMS
BUNCHED TOGETHER AND JIM COULD STAND UP STRAIGHT IN IT
IT WAS COOL IN
THERE
JIM WAS FOR PUTTING OUR TRAPS IN THERE RIGHT AWAY BUT I SAID WE
DIDN'T WANT TO BE CLIMBING UP AND DOWN THERE ALL THE TIME
JIM SAID IF WE HAD THE CANOE HID IN A GOOD PLACE AND HAD ALL THE TRAPS
IN THE CAVERN WE COULD RUSH THERE IF ANYBODY WAS TO COME TO THE ISLAND
AND THEY WOULD NEVER FIND US WITHOUT DOGS
AND BESIDES HE SAID THEM
LITTLE BIRDS HAD SAID IT WAS GOING TO RAIN AND DID I WANT THE THINGS TO
GET WET
SO WE WENT BACK AND GOT THE CANOE AND PADDLED UP ABREAST THE CAVERN
AND LUGGED ALL THE TRAPS UP THERE
THEN WE HUNTED UP A PLACE CLOSE BY
TO HIDE THE CANOE IN AMONGST THE THICK WILLOWS
WE TOOK SOME FISH OFF
OF THE LINES AND SET THEM AGAIN AND BEGUN TO GET READY FOR DINNER
THE DOOR OF THE CAVERN WAS BIG ENOUGH TO ROLL A HOGSHEAD IN AND ON ONE
SIDE OF THE DOOR THE FLOOR STUCK OUT A LITTLE BIT AND WAS FLAT AND A
GOOD PLACE TO BUILD A FIRE ON
SO WE BUILT IT THERE AND COOKED DINNER
WE SPREAD THE BLANKETS INSIDE FOR A CARPET AND EAT OUR DINNER IN THERE
WE PUT ALL THE OTHER THINGS HANDY AT THE BACK OF THE CAVERN
PRETTY
SOON IT DARKENED UP AND BEGUN TO THUNDER AND LIGHTEN SO THE BIRDS WAS
RIGHT ABOUT IT
DIRECTLY IT BEGUN TO RAIN AND IT RAINED LIKE ALL FURY
TOO AND I NEVER SEE THE WIND BLOW SO
IT WAS ONE OF THESE REGULAR
SUMMER STORMS
IT WOULD GET SO DARK THAT IT LOOKED ALL BLUE BLACK
OUTSIDE AND LOVELY AND THE RAIN WOULD THRASH ALONG BY SO THICK THAT
THE TREES OFF A LITTLE WAYS LOOKED DIM AND SPIDER WEBBY AND HERE WOULD
COME A BLAST OF WIND THAT WOULD BEND THE TREES DOWN AND TURN UP THE
PALE UNDERSIDE OF THE LEAVES AND THEN A PERFECT RIPPER OF A GUST WOULD
FOLLOW ALONG AND SET THE BRANCHES TO TOSSING THEIR ARMS AS IF THEY
WAS JUST WILD AND NEXT WHEN IT WAS JUST ABOUT THE BLUEST AND
BLACKEST FST IT WAS AS BRIGHT AS GLORY AND YOU'D HAVE A LITTLE
GLIMPSE OF TREE TOPS A PLUNGING ABOUT AWAY OFF YONDER IN THE STORM
HUNDREDS OF YARDS FURTHER THAN YOU COULD SEE BEFORE DARK AS SIN AGAIN
IN A SECOND AND NOW YOU'D HEAR THE THUNDER LET GO WITH AN AWFUL CRASH
AND THEN GO RUMBLING GRUMBLING TUMBLING DOWN THE SKY TOWARDS THE
UNDER SIDE OF THE WORLD LIKE ROLLING EMPTY BARRELS DOWN STAIRS WHERE
IT'S LONG STAIRS AND THEY BOUNCE A GOOD DEAL YOU KNOW
JIM THIS IS NICE I SAYS
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE NOWHERE ELSE BUT
HERE
PASS ME ALONG ANOTHER HUNK OF FISH AND SOME HOT CORN BREAD
WELL YOU WOULDN'T A BEN HERE 'F IT HADN'T A BEN FOR JIM
YOU'D A BEN
DOWN DAH IN DE WOODS WIDOUT ANY DINNER EN GITTN' MOS' DROWNDED TOO
DAT YOU WOULD HONEY
CHICKENS KNOWS WHEN IT'S GWYNE TO RAIN EN SO DO
DE BIRDS CHILE
THE RIVER WENT ON RAISING AND RAISING FOR TEN OR TWELVE DAYS TILL AT
LAST IT WAS OVER THE BANKS
THE WATER WAS THREE OR FOUR FOOT DEEP ON
THE ISLAND IN THE LOW PLACES AND ON THE ILLINOIS BOTTOM
ON THAT SIDE
IT WAS A GOOD MANY MILES WIDE BUT ON THE MISSOURI SIDE IT WAS THE SAME
OLD DISTANCE ACROSS A HALF A MILE BECAUSE THE MISSOURI SHORE WAS JUST A
WALL OF HIGH BLUFFS
DAYTIMES WE PADDLED ALL OVER THE ISLAND IN THE CANOE IT WAS MIGHTY COOL
AND SHADY IN THE DEEP WOODS EVEN IF THE SUN WAS BLAZING OUTSIDE
WE
WENT WINDING IN AND OUT AMONGST THE TREES AND SOMETIMES THE VINES HUNG
SO THICK WE HAD TO BACK AWAY AND GO SOME OTHER WAY
WELL ON EVERY OLD
BROKEN DOWN TREE YOU COULD SEE RABBITS AND SNAKES AND SUCH THINGS AND
WHEN THE ISLAND HAD BEEN OVERFLOWED A DAY OR TWO THEY GOT SO TAME ON
ACCOUNT OF BEING HUNGRY THAT YOU COULD PADDLE RIGHT UP AND PUT YOUR
HAND ON THEM IF YOU WANTED TO BUT NOT THE SNAKES AND TURTLES THEY WOULD
SLIDE OFF IN THE WATER
THE RIDGE OUR CAVERN WAS IN WAS FULL OF THEM
WE COULD A HAD PETS ENOUGH IF WE'D WANTED THEM
ONE NIGHT WE CATCHED A LITTLE SECTION OF A LUMBER RAFT NICE PINE PLANKS
IT WAS TWELVE FOOT WIDE AND ABOUT FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN FOOT LONG AND
THE TOP STOOD ABOVE WATER SIX OR SEVEN INCHES A SOLID LEVEL FLOOR
WE
COULD SEE SAW LOGS GO BY IN THE DAYLIGHT SOMETIMES BUT WE LET THEM GO
WE DIDN'T SHOW OURSELVES IN DAYLIGHT
ANOTHER NIGHT WHEN WE WAS UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND JUST BEFORE
DAYLIGHT HERE COMES A FRAME HOUSE DOWN ON THE WEST SIDE
SHE WAS
A TWO STORY AND TILTED OVER CONSIDERABLE
WE PADDLED OUT AND GOT
ABOARD CLUMB IN AT AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW
BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE YET
SO WE MADE THE CANOE FAST AND SET IN HER TO WAIT FOR DAYLIGHT
THE LIGHT BEGUN TO COME BEFORE WE GOT TO THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND
THEN
WE LOOKED IN AT THE WINDOW
WE COULD MAKE OUT A BED AND A TABLE AND
TWO OLD CHAIRS AND LOTS OF THINGS AROUND ABOUT ON THE FLOOR AND THERE
WAS CLOTHES HANGING AGAINST THE WALL
THERE WAS SOMETHING LAYING ON THE
FLOOR IN THE FAR CORNER THAT LOOKED LIKE A MAN
SO JIM SAYS
HELLO YOU
BUT IT DIDN'T BUDGE
SO I HOLLERED AGAIN AND THEN JIM SAYS
DE MAN AIN'T ASLEEP HE'S DEAD
YOU HOLD STILL I'LL GO EN SEE
HE WENT AND BENT DOWN AND LOOKED AND SAYS
IT'S A DEAD MAN
YES INDEEDY NAKED TOO
HE'S BEN SHOT IN DE BACK
I RECK'N HE'S BEN DEAD TWO ER THREE DAYS
COME IN HUCK BUT DOAN' LOOK
AT HIS FACE IT'S TOO GASHLY
I DIDN'T LOOK AT HIM AT ALL
JIM THROWED SOME OLD RAGS OVER HIM BUT
HE NEEDN'T DONE IT I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM
THERE WAS HEAPS OF OLD
GREASY CARDS SCATTERED AROUND OVER THE FLOOR AND OLD WHISKY BOTTLES
AND A COUPLE OF MASKS MADE OUT OF BLACK CLOTH AND ALL OVER THE WALLS
WAS THE IGNORANTEST KIND OF WORDS AND PICTURES MADE WITH CHARCOAL
THERE WAS TWO OLD DIRTY CALICO DRESSES AND A SUN BONNET AND SOME
WOMEN'S UNDERCLOTHES HANGING AGAINST THE WALL AND SOME MEN'S CLOTHING
TOO
WE PUT THE LOT INTO THE CANOE IT MIGHT COME GOOD
THERE WAS A
BOY'S OLD SPECKLED STRAW HAT ON THE FLOOR I TOOK THAT TOO
AND THERE
WAS A BOTTLE THAT HAD HAD MILK IN IT AND IT HAD A RAG STOPPER FOR A
BABY TO SUCK
WE WOULD A TOOK THE BOTTLE BUT IT WAS BROKE
THERE WAS
A SEEDY OLD CHEST AND AN OLD HAIR TRUNK WITH THE HINGES BROKE
THEY
STOOD OPEN BUT THERE WARN'T NOTHING LEFT IN THEM THAT WAS ANY ACCOUNT
THE WAY THINGS WAS SCATTERED ABOUT WE RECKONED THE PEOPLE LEFT IN A
HURRY AND WARN'T FIXED SO AS TO CARRY OFF MOST OF THEIR STUFF
WE GOT AN OLD TIN LANTERN AND A BUTCHER KNIFE WITHOUT ANY HANDLE AND
A BRAN NEW BARLOW KNIFE WORTH TWO BITS IN ANY STORE AND A LOT OF TALLOW
CANDLES AND A TIN CANDLESTICK AND A GOURD AND A TIN CUP AND A RATTY
OLD BEDQUILT OFF THE BED AND A RETICULE WITH NEEDLES AND PINS AND
BEESWAX AND BUTTONS AND THREAD AND ALL SUCH TRUCK IN IT AND A HATCHET
AND SOME NAILS AND A FISHLINE AS THICK AS MY LITTLE FINGER WITH SOME
MONSTROUS HOOKS ON IT AND A ROLL OF BUCKSKIN AND A LEATHER DOG COLLAR
AND A HORSESHOE AND SOME VIALS OF MEDICINE THAT DIDN'T HAVE NO LABEL
ON THEM AND JUST AS WE WAS LEAVING I FOUND A TOLERABLE GOOD CURRY COMB
AND JIM HE FOUND A RATTY OLD FIDDLE BOW AND A WOODEN LEG
THE STRAPS
WAS BROKE OFF OF IT BUT BARRING THAT IT WAS A GOOD ENOUGH LEG THOUGH
IT WAS TOO LONG FOR ME AND NOT LONG ENOUGH FOR JIM AND WE COULDN'T FIND
THE OTHER ONE THOUGH WE HUNTED ALL AROUND
AND SO TAKE IT ALL AROUND WE MADE A GOOD HAUL
WHEN WE WAS READY TO
SHOVE OFF WE WAS A QUARTER OF A MILE BELOW THE ISLAND AND IT WAS PRETTY
BROAD DAY SO I MADE JIM LAY DOWN IN THE CANOE AND COVER UP WITH THE
QUILT BECAUSE IF HE SET UP PEOPLE COULD TELL HE WAS A NIGGER A GOOD
WAYS OFF
I PADDLED OVER TO THE ILLINOIS SHORE AND DRIFTED DOWN MOST
A HALF A MILE DOING IT
I CREPT UP THE DEAD WATER UNDER THE BANK AND
HADN'T NO ACCIDENTS AND DIDN'T SEE NOBODY
WE GOT HOME ALL SAFE
CHAPTER X
AFTER BREAKFAST I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE DEAD MAN AND GUESS OUT HOW HE
COME TO BE KILLED BUT JIM DIDN'T WANT TO
HE SAID IT WOULD FETCH BAD
LUCK AND BESIDES HE SAID HE MIGHT COME AND HA'NT US HE SAID A MAN
THAT WARN'T BURIED WAS MORE LIKELY TO GO A HA'NTING AROUND THAN ONE
THAT WAS PLANTED AND COMFORTABLE
THAT SOUNDED PRETTY REASONABLE SO
I DIDN'T SAY NO MORE BUT I COULDN'T KEEP FROM STUDYING OVER IT AND
WISHING I KNOWED WHO SHOT THE MAN AND WHAT THEY DONE IT FOR
WE RUMMAGED THE CLOTHES WE'D GOT AND FOUND EIGHT DOLLARS IN SILVER
SEWED UP IN THE LINING OF AN OLD BLANKET OVERCOAT
JIM SAID HE RECKONED
THE PEOPLE IN THAT HOUSE STOLE THE COAT BECAUSE IF THEY'D A KNOWED THE
MONEY WAS THERE THEY WOULDN'T A LEFT IT
I SAID I RECKONED THEY KILLED
HIM TOO BUT JIM DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT
I SAYS
NOW YOU THINK IT'S BAD LUCK BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY WHEN I FETCHED IN THE
SNAKE SKIN THAT I FOUND ON THE TOP OF THE RIDGE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
YOU SAID IT WAS THE WORST BAD LUCK IN THE WORLD TO TOUCH A SNAKE SKIN
WITH MY HANDS
WELL HERE'S YOUR BAD LUCK WE'VE RAKED IN ALL THIS
TRUCK AND EIGHT DOLLARS BESIDES
I WISH WE COULD HAVE SOME BAD LUCK
LIKE THIS EVERY DAY JIM
NEVER YOU MIND HONEY NEVER YOU MIND
DON'T YOU GIT TOO PEART
IT'S
A COMIN'
MIND I TELL YOU IT'S A COMIN'
IT DID COME TOO
IT WAS A TUESDAY THAT WE HAD THAT TALK
WELL AFTER
DINNER FRIDAY WE WAS LAYING AROUND IN THE GRASS AT THE UPPER END OF THE
RIDGE AND GOT OUT OF TOBACCO
I WENT TO THE CAVERN TO GET SOME AND
FOUND A RATTLESNAKE IN THERE
I KILLED HIM AND CURLED HIM UP ON THE
FOOT OF JIM'S BLANKET EVER SO NATURAL THINKING THERE'D BE SOME FUN
WHEN JIM FOUND HIM THERE
WELL BY NIGHT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE SNAKE
AND WHEN JIM FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN ON THE BLANKET WHILE I STRUCK A LIGHT
THE SNAKE'S MATE WAS THERE AND BIT HIM
HE JUMPED UP YELLING AND THE FIRST THING THE LIGHT SHOWED WAS THE
VARMINT CURLED UP AND READY FOR ANOTHER SPRING
I LAID HIM OUT IN A
SECOND WITH A STICK AND JIM GRABBED PAP'S WHISKY JUG AND BEGUN TO POUR
IT DOWN
HE WAS BAREFOOTED AND THE SNAKE BIT HIM RIGHT ON THE HEEL
THAT ALL
COMES OF MY BEING SUCH A FOOL AS TO NOT REMEMBER THAT WHEREVER YOU LEAVE
A DEAD SNAKE ITS MATE ALWAYS COMES THERE AND CURLS AROUND IT
JIM TOLD
ME TO CHOP OFF THE SNAKE'S HEAD AND THROW IT AWAY AND THEN SKIN THE
BODY AND ROAST A PIECE OF IT
I DONE IT AND HE EAT IT AND SAID IT
WOULD HELP CURE HIM
HE MADE ME TAKE OFF THE RATTLES AND TIE THEM AROUND
HIS WRIST TOO
HE SAID THAT THAT WOULD HELP
THEN I SLID OUT QUIET
AND THROWED THE SNAKES CLEAR AWAY AMONGST THE BUSHES FOR I WARN'T GOING
TO LET JIM FIND OUT IT WAS ALL MY FAULT NOT IF I COULD HELP IT
JIM SUCKED AND SUCKED AT THE JUG AND NOW AND THEN HE GOT OUT OF HIS
HEAD AND PITCHED AROUND AND YELLED BUT EVERY TIME HE COME TO HIMSELF HE
WENT TO SUCKING AT THE JUG AGAIN
HIS FOOT SWELLED UP PRETTY BIG AND
SO DID HIS LEG BUT BY AND BY THE DRUNK BEGUN TO COME AND SO I JUDGED
HE WAS ALL RIGHT BUT I'D DRUTHER BEEN BIT WITH A SNAKE THAN PAP'S
WHISKY
JIM WAS LAID UP FOR FOUR DAYS AND NIGHTS
THEN THE SWELLING WAS ALL
GONE AND HE WAS AROUND AGAIN
I MADE UP MY MIND I WOULDN'T EVER TAKE
A HOLT OF A SNAKE SKIN AGAIN WITH MY HANDS NOW THAT I SEE WHAT HAD COME
OF IT
JIM SAID HE RECKONED I WOULD BELIEVE HIM NEXT TIME
AND HE SAID
THAT HANDLING A SNAKE SKIN WAS SUCH AWFUL BAD LUCK THAT MAYBE WE HADN'T
GOT TO THE END OF IT YET
HE SAID HE DRUTHER SEE THE NEW MOON OVER HIS
LEFT SHOULDER AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND TIMES THAN TAKE UP A SNAKE SKIN
IN HIS HAND
WELL I WAS GETTING TO FEEL THAT WAY MYSELF THOUGH I'VE
ALWAYS RECKONED THAT LOOKING AT THE NEW MOON OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER IS
ONE OF THE CARELESSEST AND FOOLISHEST THINGS A BODY CAN DO
OLD HANK
BUNKER DONE IT ONCE AND BRAGGED ABOUT IT AND IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE
GOT DRUNK AND FELL OFF OF THE SHOT TOWER AND SPREAD HIMSELF OUT SO
THAT HE WAS JUST A KIND OF A LAYER AS YOU MAY SAY AND THEY SLID HIM
EDGEWAYS BETWEEN TWO BARN DOORS FOR A COFFIN AND BURIED HIM SO SO
THEY SAY BUT I DIDN'T SEE IT
PAP TOLD ME
BUT ANYWAY IT ALL COME OF
LOOKING AT THE MOON THAT WAY LIKE A FOOL
WELL THE DAYS WENT ALONG AND THE RIVER WENT DOWN BETWEEN ITS BANKS
AGAIN AND ABOUT THE FIRST THING WE DONE WAS TO BAIT ONE OF THE BIG
HOOKS WITH A SKINNED RABBIT AND SET IT AND CATCH A CATFISH THAT WAS
AS BIG AS A MAN BEING SIX FOOT TWO INCHES LONG AND WEIGHED OVER TWO
HUNDRED POUNDS
WE COULDN'T HANDLE HIM OF COURSE HE WOULD A FLUNG US
INTO ILLINOIS
WE JUST SET THERE AND WATCHED HIM RIP AND TEAR AROUND
TILL HE DROWNDED
WE FOUND A BRASS BUTTON IN HIS STOMACH AND A ROUND
BALL AND LOTS OF RUBBAGE
WE SPLIT THE BALL OPEN WITH THE HATCHET
AND THERE WAS A SPOOL IN IT
JIM SAID HE'D HAD IT THERE A LONG TIME TO
COAT IT OVER SO AND MAKE A BALL OF IT
IT WAS AS BIG A FISH AS WAS EVER
CATCHED IN THE MISSISSIPPI I RECKON
JIM SAID HE HADN'T EVER SEEN
A BIGGER ONE
HE WOULD A BEEN WORTH A GOOD DEAL OVER AT THE VILLAGE
THEY PEDDLE OUT SUCH A FISH AS THAT BY THE POUND IN THE MARKET HOUSE
THERE EVERYBODY BUYS SOME OF HIM HIS MEAT'S AS WHITE AS SNOW AND MAKES
A GOOD FRY
NEXT MORNING I SAID IT WAS GETTING SLOW AND DULL AND I WANTED TO GET A
STIRRING UP SOME WAY
I SAID I RECKONED I WOULD SLIP OVER THE RIVER AND
FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
JIM LIKED THAT NOTION BUT HE SAID I
MUST GO IN THE DARK AND LOOK SHARP
THEN HE STUDIED IT OVER AND SAID
COULDN'T I PUT ON SOME OF THEM OLD THINGS AND DRESS UP LIKE A GIRL
THAT WAS A GOOD NOTION TOO
SO WE SHORTENED UP ONE OF THE CALICO
GOWNS AND I TURNED UP MY TROUSER LEGS TO MY KNEES AND GOT INTO IT
JIM
HITCHED IT BEHIND WITH THE HOOKS AND IT WAS A FAIR FIT
I PUT ON THE
SUN BONNET AND TIED IT UNDER MY CHIN AND THEN FOR A BODY TO LOOK IN
AND SEE MY FACE WAS LIKE LOOKING DOWN A JOINT OF STOVE PIPE
JIM SAID
NOBODY WOULD KNOW ME EVEN IN THE DAYTIME HARDLY
I PRACTICED AROUND
ALL DAY TO GET THE HANG OF THE THINGS AND BY AND BY I COULD DO PRETTY
WELL IN THEM ONLY JIM SAID I DIDN'T WALK LIKE A GIRL AND HE SAID
I MUST QUIT PULLING UP MY GOWN TO GET AT MY BRITCHES POCKET
I TOOK
NOTICE AND DONE BETTER
I STARTED UP THE ILLINOIS SHORE IN THE CANOE JUST AFTER DARK
I STARTED ACROSS TO THE TOWN FROM A LITTLE BELOW THE FERRY LANDING AND
THE DRIFT OF THE CURRENT FETCHED ME IN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TOWN
I
TIED UP AND STARTED ALONG THE BANK
THERE WAS A LIGHT BURNING IN A
LITTLE SHANTY THAT HADN'T BEEN LIVED IN FOR A LONG TIME AND I WONDERED
WHO HAD TOOK UP QUARTERS THERE
I SLIPPED UP AND PEEPED IN AT THE
WINDOW
THERE WAS A WOMAN ABOUT FORTY YEAR OLD IN THERE KNITTING BY
A CANDLE THAT WAS ON A PINE TABLE
I DIDN'T KNOW HER FACE SHE WAS A
STRANGER FOR YOU COULDN'T START A FACE IN THAT TOWN THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
NOW THIS WAS LUCKY BECAUSE I WAS WEAKENING I WAS GETTING AFRAID I HAD
COME PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW MY VOICE AND FIND ME OUT
BUT IF THIS WOMAN HAD
BEEN IN SUCH A LITTLE TOWN TWO DAYS SHE COULD TELL ME ALL I WANTED TO
KNOW SO I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND MADE UP MY MIND I WOULDN'T FORGET I
WAS A GIRL
CHAPTER XI
COME IN SAYS THE WOMAN AND I DID
SHE SAYS TAKE A CHEER
I DONE IT
SHE LOOKED ME ALL OVER WITH HER LITTLE SHINY EYES AND SAYS
WHAT MIGHT YOUR NAME BE

I AIN'T AFEARED
OF THE DARK
SHE SAID SHE WOULDN'T LET ME GO BY MYSELF BUT HER HUSBAND WOULD BE IN
BY AND BY MAYBE IN A HOUR AND A HALF AND SHE'D SEND HIM ALONG WITH ME
THEN SHE GOT TO TALKING ABOUT HER HUSBAND AND ABOUT HER RELATIONS UP
THE RIVER AND HER RELATIONS DOWN THE RIVER AND ABOUT HOW MUCH BETTER
OFF THEY USED TO WAS AND HOW THEY DIDN'T KNOW BUT THEY'D MADE A MISTAKE
COMING TO OUR TOWN INSTEAD OF LETTING WELL ALONE AND SO ON AND SO ON
TILL I WAS AFEARD I HAD MADE A MISTAKE COMING TO HER TO FIND OUT WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN THE TOWN BUT BY AND BY SHE DROPPED ON TO PAP AND THE
MURDER AND THEN I WAS PRETTY WILLING TO LET HER CLATTER RIGHT ALONG
SHE TOLD ABOUT ME AND TOM SAWYER FINDING THE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS ONLY

BLOWS OVER A LITTLE FOR PEOPLE THINKS NOW THAT HE KILLED HIS BOY AND

PLACE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND THEN I GOT EASY AGAIN
SHE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE RATS
YOU'D SEE ONE STICK HIS NOSE OUT OF A HOLE IN THE CORNER
EVERY LITTLE WHILE
SHE SAID SHE HAD TO HAVE THINGS HANDY TO THROW AT
THEM WHEN SHE WAS ALONE OR THEY WOULDN'T GIVE HER NO PEACE
SHE SHOWED
ME A BAR OF LEAD TWISTED UP INTO A KNOT AND SAID SHE WAS A GOOD SHOT
WITH IT GENERLY BUT SHE'D WRENCHED HER ARM A DAY OR TWO AGO AND DIDN'T
KNOW WHETHER SHE COULD THROW TRUE NOW
BUT SHE WATCHED FOR A CHANCE
AND DIRECTLY BANGED AWAY AT A RAT BUT SHE MISSED HIM WIDE AND SAID
OUCH IT HURT HER ARM SO
THEN SHE TOLD ME TO TRY FOR THE NEXT ONE
I WANTED TO BE GETTING AWAY BEFORE THE OLD MAN GOT BACK BUT OF COURSE
I DIDN'T LET ON
I GOT THE THING AND THE FIRST RAT THAT SHOWED HIS
NOSE I LET DRIVE AND IF HE'D A STAYED WHERE HE WAS HE'D A BEEN A
TOLERABLE SICK RAT
SHE SAID THAT WAS FIRST RATE AND SHE RECKONED I
WOULD HIVE THE NEXT ONE
SHE WENT AND GOT THE LUMP OF LEAD AND FETCHED
IT BACK AND BROUGHT ALONG A HANK OF YARN WHICH SHE WANTED ME TO HELP
HER WITH
I HELD UP MY TWO HANDS AND SHE PUT THE HANK OVER THEM AND
WENT ON TALKING ABOUT HER AND HER HUSBAND'S MATTERS
BUT SHE BROKE OFF
TO SAY
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE RATS
YOU BETTER HAVE THE LEAD IN YOUR LAP
HANDY
SO SHE DROPPED THE LUMP INTO MY LAP JUST AT THAT MOMENT AND I CLAPPED
MY LEGS TOGETHER ON IT AND SHE WENT ON TALKING
BUT ONLY ABOUT A
MINUTE
THEN SHE TOOK OFF THE HANK AND LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE FACE
AND VERY PLEASANT AND SAYS
COME NOW WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME
WH WHAT MUM
WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME IS IT BILL OR TOM OR BOB OR WHAT IS IT
I RECKON I SHOOK LIKE A LEAF AND I DIDN'T KNOW HARDLY WHAT TO DO
BUT
I SAYS
PLEASE TO DON'T POKE FUN AT A POOR GIRL LIKE ME MUM
IF I'M IN THE
WAY HERE I'LL
NO YOU WON'T
SET DOWN AND STAY WHERE YOU ARE
I AIN'T GOING TO HURT
YOU AND I AIN'T GOING TO TELL ON YOU NUTHER
YOU JUST TELL ME YOUR
SECRET AND TRUST ME
I'LL KEEP IT AND WHAT'S MORE I'LL HELP
YOU
SO'LL MY OLD MAN IF YOU WANT HIM TO
YOU SEE YOU'RE A RUNAWAY
'PRENTICE THAT'S ALL
IT AIN'T ANYTHING
THERE AIN'T NO HARM IN IT
YOU'VE BEEN TREATED BAD AND YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND TO CUT
BLESS YOU
CHILD I WOULDN'T TELL ON YOU
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT NOW THAT'S A GOOD
BOY
SO I SAID IT WOULDN'T BE NO USE TO TRY TO PLAY IT ANY LONGER AND I
WOULD JUST MAKE A CLEAN BREAST AND TELL HER EVERYTHING BUT SHE MUSN'T
GO BACK ON HER PROMISE
THEN I TOLD HER MY FATHER AND MOTHER WAS DEAD
AND THE LAW HAD BOUND ME OUT TO A MEAN OLD FARMER IN THE COUNTRY THIRTY
MILE BACK FROM THE RIVER AND HE TREATED ME SO BAD I COULDN'T STAND IT
NO LONGER HE WENT AWAY TO BE GONE A COUPLE OF DAYS AND SO I TOOK MY
CHANCE AND STOLE SOME OF HIS DAUGHTER'S OLD CLOTHES AND CLEARED OUT AND
I HAD BEEN THREE NIGHTS COMING THE THIRTY MILES
I TRAVELED NIGHTS
AND HID DAYTIMES AND SLEPT AND THE BAG OF BREAD AND MEAT I CARRIED FROM
HOME LASTED ME ALL THE WAY AND I HAD A PLENTY
I SAID I BELIEVED MY
UNCLE ABNER MOORE WOULD TAKE CARE OF ME AND SO THAT WAS WHY I STRUCK
OUT FOR THIS TOWN OF GOSHEN
GOSHEN CHILD THIS AIN'T GOSHEN
THIS IS ST
PETERSBURG
GOSHEN'S
TEN MILE FURTHER UP THE RIVER
WHO TOLD YOU THIS WAS GOSHEN
WHY A MAN I MET AT DAYBREAK THIS MORNING JUST AS I WAS GOING TO TURN
INTO THE WOODS FOR MY REGULAR SLEEP
HE TOLD ME WHEN THE ROADS FORKED I
MUST TAKE THE RIGHT HAND AND FIVE MILE WOULD FETCH ME TO GOSHEN
HE WAS DRUNK I RECKON
HE TOLD YOU JUST EXACTLY WRONG
WELL HE DID ACT LIKE HE WAS DRUNK BUT IT AIN'T NO MATTER NOW
I GOT
TO BE MOVING ALONG
I'LL FETCH GOSHEN BEFORE DAYLIGHT
HOLD ON A MINUTE
I'LL PUT YOU UP A SNACK TO EAT
YOU MIGHT WANT IT
SO SHE PUT ME UP A SNACK AND SAYS
SAY WHEN A COW'S LAYING DOWN WHICH END OF HER GETS UP FIRST ANSWER
UP PROMPT NOW DON'T STOP TO STUDY OVER IT
WHICH END GETS UP FIRST
THE HIND END MUM
WELL THEN A HORSE
THE FOR'RARD END MUM
WHICH SIDE OF A TREE DOES THE MOSS GROW ON
NORTH SIDE
IF FIFTEEN COWS IS BROWSING ON A HILLSIDE HOW MANY OF THEM EATS WITH
THEIR HEADS POINTED THE SAME DIRECTION
THE WHOLE FIFTEEN MUM
WELL I RECKON YOU HAVE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
WAS TRYING TO HOCUS ME AGAIN
WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME NOW
GEORGE PETERS MUM
WELL TRY TO REMEMBER IT GEORGE
DON'T FORGET AND TELL ME IT'S
ELEXANDER BEFORE YOU GO AND THEN GET OUT BY SAYING IT'S GEORGE
ELEXANDER WHEN I CATCH YOU
AND DON'T GO ABOUT WOMEN IN THAT OLD
CALICO
YOU DO A GIRL TOLERABLE POOR BUT YOU MIGHT FOOL MEN MAYBE
BLESS YOU CHILD WHEN YOU SET OUT TO THREAD A NEEDLE DON'T HOLD THE
THREAD STILL AND FETCH THE NEEDLE UP TO IT HOLD THE NEEDLE STILL AND
POKE THE THREAD AT IT THAT'S THE WAY A WOMAN MOST ALWAYS DOES BUT A
MAN ALWAYS DOES T'OTHER WAY
AND WHEN YOU THROW AT A RAT OR ANYTHING
HITCH YOURSELF UP A TIPTOE AND FETCH YOUR HAND UP OVER YOUR HEAD AS
AWKWARD AS YOU CAN AND MISS YOUR RAT ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN FOOT
THROW
STIFF ARMED FROM THE SHOULDER LIKE THERE WAS A PIVOT THERE FOR IT TO
TURN ON LIKE A GIRL NOT FROM THE WRIST AND ELBOW WITH YOUR ARM OUT
TO ONE SIDE LIKE A BOY
AND MIND YOU WHEN A GIRL TRIES TO CATCH
ANYTHING IN HER LAP SHE THROWS HER KNEES APART SHE DON'T CLAP THEM
TOGETHER THE WAY YOU DID WHEN YOU CATCHED THE LUMP OF LEAD
WHY I
SPOTTED YOU FOR A BOY WHEN YOU WAS THREADING THE NEEDLE AND I CONTRIVED
THE OTHER THINGS JUST TO MAKE CERTAIN
NOW TROT ALONG TO YOUR UNCLE
SARAH MARY WILLIAMS GEORGE ELEXANDER PETERS AND IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE
YOU SEND WORD TO MRS
JUDITH LOFTUS WHICH IS ME AND I'LL DO WHAT I CAN
TO GET YOU OUT OF IT
KEEP THE RIVER ROAD ALL THE WAY AND NEXT TIME
YOU TRAMP TAKE SHOES AND SOCKS WITH YOU
THE RIVER ROAD'S A ROCKY ONE
AND YOUR FEET'LL BE IN A CONDITION WHEN YOU GET TO GOSHEN I RECKON
I WENT UP THE BANK ABOUT FIFTY YARDS AND THEN I DOUBLED ON MY TRACKS
AND SLIPPED BACK TO WHERE MY CANOE WAS A GOOD PIECE BELOW THE HOUSE
I
JUMPED IN AND WAS OFF IN A HURRY
I WENT UP STREAM FAR ENOUGH TO
MAKE THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND AND THEN STARTED ACROSS
I TOOK OFF THE
SUN BONNET FOR I DIDN'T WANT NO BLINDERS ON THEN
WHEN I WAS ABOUT THE
MIDDLE I HEARD THE CLOCK BEGIN TO STRIKE SO I STOPS AND LISTENS THE
SOUND COME FAINT OVER THE WATER BUT CLEAR ELEVEN
WHEN I STRUCK THE
HEAD OF THE ISLAND I NEVER WAITED TO BLOW THOUGH I WAS MOST WINDED BUT
I SHOVED RIGHT INTO THE TIMBER WHERE MY OLD CAMP USED TO BE AND STARTED
A GOOD FIRE THERE ON A HIGH AND DRY SPOT
THEN I JUMPED IN THE CANOE AND DUG OUT FOR OUR PLACE A MILE AND A HALF
BELOW AS HARD AS I COULD GO
I LANDED AND SLOPPED THROUGH THE TIMBER
AND UP THE RIDGE AND INTO THE CAVERN
THERE JIM LAID SOUND ASLEEP ON
THE GROUND
I ROUSED HIM OUT AND SAYS
GIT UP AND HUMP YOURSELF JIM THERE AIN'T A MINUTE TO LOSE
THEY'RE
AFTER US
JIM NEVER ASKED NO QUESTIONS HE NEVER SAID A WORD BUT THE WAY HE
WORKED FOR THE NEXT HALF AN HOUR SHOWED ABOUT HOW HE WAS SCARED
BY
THAT TIME EVERYTHING WE HAD IN THE WORLD WAS ON OUR RAFT AND SHE WAS
READY TO BE SHOVED OUT FROM THE WILLOW COVE WHERE SHE WAS HID
WE
PUT OUT THE CAMP FIRE AT THE CAVERN THE FIRST THING AND DIDN'T SHOW A
CANDLE OUTSIDE AFTER THAT
I TOOK THE CANOE OUT FROM THE SHORE A LITTLE PIECE AND TOOK A LOOK
BUT IF THERE WAS A BOAT AROUND I COULDN'T SEE IT FOR STARS AND SHADOWS
AIN'T GOOD TO SEE BY
THEN WE GOT OUT THE RAFT AND SLIPPED ALONG DOWN
IN THE SHADE PAST THE FOOT OF THE ISLAND DEAD STILL NEVER SAYING A
WORD
CHAPTER XII
IT MUST A BEEN CLOSE ON TO ONE O'CLOCK WHEN WE GOT BELOW THE ISLAND AT
LAST AND THE RAFT DID SEEM TO GO MIGHTY SLOW
IF A BOAT WAS TO COME
ALONG WE WAS GOING TO TAKE TO THE CANOE AND BREAK FOR THE ILLINOIS
SHORE AND IT WAS WELL A BOAT DIDN'T COME FOR WE HADN'T EVER THOUGHT TO
PUT THE GUN IN THE CANOE OR A FISHING LINE OR ANYTHING TO EAT
WE
WAS IN RUTHER TOO MUCH OF A SWEAT TO THINK OF SO MANY THINGS
IT WARN'T
GOOD JUDGMENT TO PUT EVERYTHING ON THE RAFT
IF THE MEN WENT TO THE ISLAND I JUST EXPECT THEY FOUND THE CAMP FIRE I
BUILT AND WATCHED IT ALL NIGHT FOR JIM TO COME
ANYWAYS THEY STAYED
AWAY FROM US AND IF MY BUILDING THE FIRE NEVER FOOLED THEM IT WARN'T NO
FAULT OF MINE
I PLAYED IT AS LOW DOWN ON THEM AS I COULD
WHEN THE FIRST STREAK OF DAY BEGAN TO SHOW WE TIED UP TO A TOWHEAD IN A
BIG BEND ON THE ILLINOIS SIDE AND HACKED OFF COTTONWOOD BRANCHES WITH
THE HATCHET AND COVERED UP THE RAFT WITH THEM SO SHE LOOKED LIKE THERE
HAD BEEN A CAVE IN IN THE BANK THERE
A TOW HEAD IS A SANDBAR THAT HAS
COTTONWOODS ON IT AS THICK AS HARROW TEETH
WE HAD MOUNTAINS ON THE MISSOURI SHORE AND HEAVY TIMBER ON THE ILLINOIS
SIDE AND THE CHANNEL WAS DOWN THE MISSOURI SHORE AT THAT PLACE SO WE
WARN'T AFRAID OF ANYBODY RUNNING ACROSS US
WE LAID THERE ALL DAY
AND WATCHED THE RAFTS AND STEAMBOATS SPIN DOWN THE MISSOURI SHORE AND
UP BOUND STEAMBOATS FIGHT THE BIG RIVER IN THE MIDDLE
I TOLD JIM ALL
ABOUT THE TIME I HAD JABBERING WITH THAT WOMAN AND JIM SAID SHE WAS
A SMART ONE AND IF SHE WAS TO START AFTER US HERSELF SHE WOULDN'T SET
DOWN AND WATCH A CAMP FIRE NO SIR SHE'D FETCH A DOG
WELL THEN I
SAID WHY COULDN'T SHE TELL HER HUSBAND TO FETCH A DOG JIM SAID HE
BET SHE DID THINK OF IT BY THE TIME THE MEN WAS READY TO START AND HE
BELIEVED THEY MUST A GONE UP TOWN TO GET A DOG AND SO THEY LOST ALL THAT
TIME OR ELSE WE WOULDN'T BE HERE ON A TOWHEAD SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN MILE
BELOW THE VILLAGE NO INDEEDY WE WOULD BE IN THAT SAME OLD TOWN AGAIN
SO I SAID I DIDN'T CARE WHAT WAS THE REASON THEY DIDN'T GET US AS LONG
AS THEY DIDN'T
WHEN IT WAS BEGINNING TO COME ON DARK WE POKED OUR HEADS OUT OF THE
COTTONWOOD THICKET AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ACROSS NOTHING IN SIGHT
SO JIM TOOK UP SOME OF THE TOP PLANKS OF THE RAFT AND BUILT A SNUG
WIGWAM TO GET UNDER IN BLAZING WEATHER AND RAINY AND TO KEEP THE THINGS
DRY
JIM MADE A FLOOR FOR THE WIGWAM AND RAISED IT A FOOT OR MORE ABOVE
THE LEVEL OF THE RAFT SO NOW THE BLANKETS AND ALL THE TRAPS WAS OUT OF
REACH OF STEAMBOAT WAVES
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WIGWAM WE MADE A
LAYER OF DIRT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX INCHES DEEP WITH A FRAME AROUND IT FOR
TO HOLD IT TO ITS PLACE THIS WAS TO BUILD A FIRE ON IN SLOPPY WEATHER
OR CHILLY THE WIGWAM WOULD KEEP IT FROM BEING SEEN
WE MADE AN EXTRA
STEERING OAR TOO BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHERS MIGHT GET BROKE ON A SNAG
OR SOMETHING
WE FIXED UP A SHORT FORKED STICK TO HANG THE OLD LANTERN
ON BECAUSE WE MUST ALWAYS LIGHT THE LANTERN WHENEVER WE SEE A STEAMBOAT
COMING DOWN STREAM TO KEEP FROM GETTING RUN OVER BUT WE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO LIGHT IT FOR UP STREAM BOATS UNLESS WE SEE WE WAS IN WHAT THEY CALL
A CROSSING FOR THE RIVER WAS PRETTY HIGH YET VERY LOW BANKS BEING
STILL A LITTLE UNDER WATER SO UP BOUND BOATS DIDN'T ALWAYS RUN THE
CHANNEL BUT HUNTED EASY WATER
THIS SECOND NIGHT WE RUN BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT HOURS WITH A CURRENT
THAT WAS MAKING OVER FOUR MILE AN HOUR
WE CATCHED FISH AND TALKED
AND WE TOOK A SWIM NOW AND THEN TO KEEP OFF SLEEPINESS
IT WAS KIND OF
SOLEMN DRIFTING DOWN THE BIG STILL RIVER LAYING ON OUR BACKS LOOKING
UP AT THE STARS AND WE DIDN'T EVER FEEL LIKE TALKING LOUD AND IT
WARN'T OFTEN THAT WE LAUGHED ONLY A LITTLE KIND OF A LOW CHUCKLE
WE
HAD MIGHTY GOOD WEATHER AS A GENERAL THING AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENED TO
US AT ALL THAT NIGHT NOR THE NEXT NOR THE NEXT
EVERY NIGHT WE PASSED TOWNS SOME OF THEM AWAY UP ON BLACK HILLSIDES
NOTHING BUT JUST A SHINY BED OF LIGHTS NOT A HOUSE COULD YOU SEE
THE
FIFTH NIGHT WE PASSED ST
LOUIS AND IT WAS LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD LIT UP
IN ST
PETERSBURG THEY USED TO SAY THERE WAS TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND
PEOPLE IN ST
LOUIS BUT I NEVER BELIEVED IT TILL I SEE THAT WONDERFUL
SPREAD OF LIGHTS AT TWO O'CLOCK THAT STILL NIGHT
THERE WARN'T A SOUND
THERE EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP
EVERY NIGHT NOW I USED TO SLIP ASHORE TOWARDS TEN O'CLOCK AT SOME LITTLE
VILLAGE AND BUY TEN OR FIFTEEN CENTS' WORTH OF MEAL OR BACON OR OTHER
STUFF TO EAT AND SOMETIMES I LIFTED A CHICKEN THAT WARN'T ROOSTING
COMFORTABLE AND TOOK HIM ALONG
PAP ALWAYS SAID TAKE A CHICKEN WHEN
YOU GET A CHANCE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T WANT HIM YOURSELF YOU CAN EASY
FIND SOMEBODY THAT DOES AND A GOOD DEED AIN'T EVER FORGOT
I NEVER SEE
PAP WHEN HE DIDN'T WANT THE CHICKEN HIMSELF BUT THAT IS WHAT HE USED TO
SAY ANYWAY
MORNINGS BEFORE DAYLIGHT I SLIPPED INTO CORNFIELDS AND BORROWED A
WATERMELON OR A MUSHMELON OR A PUNKIN OR SOME NEW CORN OR THINGS OF
THAT KIND
PAP ALWAYS SAID IT WARN'T NO HARM TO BORROW THINGS IF YOU
WAS MEANING TO PAY THEM BACK SOME TIME BUT THE WIDOW SAID IT WARN'T
ANYTHING BUT A SOFT NAME FOR STEALING AND NO DECENT BODY WOULD DO IT
JIM SAID HE RECKONED THE WIDOW WAS PARTLY RIGHT AND PAP WAS PARTLY
RIGHT SO THE BEST WAY WOULD BE FOR US TO PICK OUT TWO OR THREE THINGS
FROM THE LIST AND SAY WE WOULDN'T BORROW THEM ANY MORE THEN HE RECKONED
IT WOULDN'T BE NO HARM TO BORROW THE OTHERS
SO WE TALKED IT OVER ALL
ONE NIGHT DRIFTING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER TRYING TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS
WHETHER TO DROP THE WATERMELONS OR THE CANTELOPES OR THE MUSHMELONS
OR WHAT
BUT TOWARDS DAYLIGHT WE GOT IT ALL SETTLED SATISFACTORY AND
CONCLUDED TO DROP CRABAPPLES AND P'SIMMONS
WE WARN'T FEELING JUST
RIGHT BEFORE THAT BUT IT WAS ALL COMFORTABLE NOW
I WAS GLAD THE WAY
IT COME OUT TOO BECAUSE CRABAPPLES AIN'T EVER GOOD AND THE P'SIMMONS
WOULDN'T BE RIPE FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS YET
WE SHOT A WATER FOWL NOW AND THEN THAT GOT UP TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING
OR DIDN'T GO TO BED EARLY ENOUGH IN THE EVENING
TAKE IT ALL ROUND WE
LIVED PRETTY HIGH
THE FIFTH NIGHT BELOW ST
LOUIS WE HAD A BIG STORM AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH
A POWER OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN A SOLID
SHEET
WE STAYED IN THE WIGWAM AND LET THE RAFT TAKE CARE OF ITSELF
WHEN THE LIGHTNING GLARED OUT WE COULD SEE A BIG STRAIGHT RIVER AHEAD
AND HIGH ROCKY BLUFFS ON BOTH SIDES
BY AND BY SAYS I HEL LO JIM
LOOKY YONDER IT WAS A STEAMBOAT THAT HAD KILLED HERSELF ON A ROCK
WE WAS DRIFTING STRAIGHT DOWN FOR HER
THE LIGHTNING SHOWED HER VERY
DISTINCT
SHE WAS LEANING OVER WITH PART OF HER UPPER DECK ABOVE
WATER AND YOU COULD SEE EVERY LITTLE CHIMBLY GUY CLEAN AND CLEAR AND A
CHAIR BY THE BIG BELL WITH AN OLD SLOUCH HAT HANGING ON THE BACK OF IT
WHEN THE FLASHES COME
WELL IT BEING AWAY IN THE NIGHT AND STORMY AND ALL SO MYSTERIOUS LIKE
I FELT JUST THE WAY ANY OTHER BOY WOULD A FELT WHEN I SEE THAT WRECK
LAYING THERE SO MOURNFUL AND LONESOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
I
WANTED TO GET ABOARD OF HER AND SLINK AROUND A LITTLE AND SEE WHAT
THERE WAS THERE
SO I SAYS
LE'S LAND ON HER JIM
BUT JIM WAS DEAD AGAINST IT AT FIRST
HE SAYS
I DOAN' WANT TO GO FOOL'N 'LONG ER NO WRACK
WE'S DOIN' BLAME' WELL
EN WE BETTER LET BLAME' WELL ALONE AS DE GOOD BOOK SAYS
LIKE AS NOT
DEY'S A WATCHMAN ON DAT WRACK
WATCHMAN YOUR GRANDMOTHER I SAYS THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO WATCH BUT
THE TEXAS AND THE PILOT HOUSE AND DO YOU RECKON ANYBODY'S GOING TO RESK
HIS LIFE FOR A TEXAS AND A PILOT HOUSE SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS WHEN
IT'S LIKELY TO BREAK UP AND WASH OFF DOWN THE RIVER ANY MINUTE JIM
COULDN'T SAY NOTHING TO THAT SO HE DIDN'T TRY
AND BESIDES I SAYS
WE MIGHT BORROW SOMETHING WORTH HAVING OUT OF THE CAPTAIN'S STATEROOM
SEEGARS I BET YOU AND COST FIVE CENTS APIECE SOLID CASH
STEAMBOAT
CAPTAINS IS ALWAYS RICH AND GET SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH AND THEY DON'T
CARE A CENT WHAT A THING COSTS YOU KNOW LONG AS THEY WANT IT
STICK A
CANDLE IN YOUR POCKET I CAN'T REST JIM TILL WE GIVE HER A RUMMAGING
DO YOU RECKON TOM SAWYER WOULD EVER GO BY THIS THING NOT FOR PIE HE
WOULDN'T
HE'D CALL IT AN ADVENTURE THAT'S WHAT HE'D CALL IT AND HE'D
LAND ON THAT WRECK IF IT WAS HIS LAST ACT
AND WOULDN'T HE THROW STYLE
INTO IT WOULDN'T HE SPREAD HIMSELF NOR NOTHING WHY YOU'D THINK IT
WAS CHRISTOPHER C'LUMBUS DISCOVERING KINGDOM COME
I WISH TOM SAWYER
WAS HERE
JIM HE GRUMBLED A LITTLE BUT GIVE IN
HE SAID WE MUSTN'T TALK ANY MORE
THAN WE COULD HELP AND THEN TALK MIGHTY LOW
THE LIGHTNING SHOWED US
THE WRECK AGAIN JUST IN TIME AND WE FETCHED THE STABBOARD DERRICK AND
MADE FAST THERE
THE DECK WAS HIGH OUT HERE
WE WENT SNEAKING DOWN THE SLOPE OF IT TO
LABBOARD IN THE DARK TOWARDS THE TEXAS FEELING OUR WAY SLOW WITH OUR
FEET AND SPREADING OUR HANDS OUT TO FEND OFF THE GUYS FOR IT WAS SO
DARK WE COULDN'T SEE NO SIGN OF THEM
PRETTY SOON WE STRUCK THE FORWARD
END OF THE SKYLIGHT AND CLUMB ON TO IT AND THE NEXT STEP FETCHED US IN
FRONT OF THE CAPTAIN'S DOOR WHICH WAS OPEN AND BY JIMMINY AWAY DOWN
THROUGH THE TEXAS HALL WE SEE A LIGHT AND ALL IN THE SAME SECOND WE
SEEM TO HEAR LOW VOICES IN YONDER
JIM WHISPERED AND SAID HE WAS FEELING POWERFUL SICK AND TOLD ME TO COME
ALONG
I SAYS ALL RIGHT AND WAS GOING TO START FOR THE RAFT BUT JUST
THEN I HEARD A VOICE WAIL OUT AND SAY
OH PLEASE DON'T BOYS I SWEAR I WON'T EVER TELL
ANOTHER VOICE SAID PRETTY LOUD
IT'S A LIE JIM TURNER
YOU'VE ACTED THIS WAY BEFORE
YOU ALWAYS WANT
MORE'N YOUR SHARE OF THE TRUCK AND YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT IT TOO BECAUSE
YOU'VE SWORE 'T IF YOU DIDN'T YOU'D TELL
BUT THIS TIME YOU'VE SAID
IT JEST ONE TIME TOO MANY
YOU'RE THE MEANEST TREACHEROUSEST HOUND IN
THIS COUNTRY
BY THIS TIME JIM WAS GONE FOR THE RAFT
I WAS JUST A BILING WITH
CURIOSITY AND I SAYS TO MYSELF TOM SAWYER WOULDN'T BACK OUT NOW
AND SO I WON'T EITHER I'M A GOING TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
SO I
DROPPED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES IN THE LITTLE PASSAGE AND CREPT AFT
IN THE DARK TILL THERE WARN'T BUT ONE STATEROOM BETWIXT ME AND THE
CROSS HALL OF THE TEXAS
THEN IN THERE I SEE A MAN STRETCHED ON THE
FLOOR AND TIED HAND AND FOOT AND TWO MEN STANDING OVER HIM AND ONE
OF THEM HAD A DIM LANTERN IN HIS HAND AND THE OTHER ONE HAD A PISTOL
THIS ONE KEPT POINTING THE PISTOL AT THE MAN'S HEAD ON THE FLOOR AND
SAYING
I'D LIKE TO AND I ORTER TOO A MEAN SKUNK
THE MAN ON THE FLOOR WOULD SHRIVEL UP AND SAY OH PLEASE DON'T BILL
I HAIN'T EVER GOIN' TO TELL
AND EVERY TIME HE SAID THAT THE MAN WITH THE LANTERN WOULD LAUGH AND
SAY
'DEED YOU AIN'T YOU NEVER SAID NO TRUER THING 'N THAT YOU BET
YOU AND ONCE HE SAID HEAR HIM BEG AND YIT IF WE HADN'T GOT THE
BEST OF HIM AND TIED HIM HE'D A KILLED US BOTH
AND WHAT FOR JIST
FOR NOTH'N
JIST BECAUSE WE STOOD ON OUR RIGHTS THAT'S WHAT FOR
BUT
I LAY YOU AIN'T A GOIN' TO THREATEN NOBODY ANY MORE JIM TURNER
PUT
UP THAT PISTOL BILL
BILL SAYS
I DON'T WANT TO JAKE PACKARD
I'M FOR KILLIN' HIM AND DIDN'T HE KILL
OLD HATFIELD JIST THE SAME WAY AND DON'T HE DESERVE IT
BUT I DON'T WANT HIM KILLED AND I'VE GOT MY REASONS FOR IT
BLESS YO' HEART FOR THEM WORDS JAKE PACKARD I'LL NEVER FORGIT YOU
LONG'S I LIVE SAYS THE MAN ON THE FLOOR SORT OF BLUBBERING
PACKARD DIDN'T TAKE NO NOTICE OF THAT BUT HUNG UP HIS LANTERN ON A NAIL
AND STARTED TOWARDS WHERE I WAS THERE IN THE DARK AND MOTIONED BILL
TO COME
I CRAWFISHED AS FAST AS I COULD ABOUT TWO YARDS BUT THE BOAT
SLANTED SO THAT I COULDN'T MAKE VERY GOOD TIME SO TO KEEP FROM GETTING
RUN OVER AND CATCHED I CRAWLED INTO A STATEROOM ON THE UPPER SIDE
THE MAN CAME A PAWING ALONG IN THE DARK AND WHEN PACKARD GOT TO MY
STATEROOM HE SAYS
HERE COME IN HERE
AND IN HE COME AND BILL AFTER HIM
BUT BEFORE THEY GOT IN I WAS UP
IN THE UPPER BERTH CORNERED AND SORRY I COME
THEN THEY STOOD THERE
WITH THEIR HANDS ON THE LEDGE OF THE BERTH AND TALKED
I COULDN'T SEE
THEM BUT I COULD TELL WHERE THEY WAS BY THE WHISKY THEY'D BEEN HAVING
I WAS GLAD I DIDN'T DRINK WHISKY BUT IT WOULDN'T MADE MUCH DIFFERENCE
ANYWAY BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME THEY COULDN'T A TREED ME BECAUSE I
DIDN'T BREATHE
I WAS TOO SCARED
AND BESIDES A BODY COULDN'T
BREATHE AND HEAR SUCH TALK
THEY TALKED LOW AND EARNEST
BILL WANTED
TO KILL TURNER
HE SAYS
HE'S SAID HE'LL TELL AND HE WILL
IF WE WAS TO GIVE BOTH OUR SHARES
TO HIM NOW IT WOULDN'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE AFTER THE ROW AND THE WAY
WE'VE SERVED HIM
SHORE'S YOU'RE BORN HE'LL TURN STATE'S EVIDENCE NOW
YOU HEAR ME
I'M FOR PUTTING HIM OUT OF HIS TROUBLES
SO'M I SAYS PACKARD VERY QUIET
BLAME IT I'D SORTER BEGUN TO THINK YOU WASN'T
WELL THEN THAT'S ALL
RIGHT
LE'S GO AND DO IT
HOLD ON A MINUTE I HAIN'T HAD MY SAY YIT
YOU LISTEN TO ME
SHOOTING'S GOOD BUT THERE'S QUIETER WAYS IF THE THING'S GOT TO BE
DONE
BUT WHAT I SAY IS THIS IT AIN'T GOOD SENSE TO GO COURT'N AROUND
AFTER A HALTER IF YOU CAN GIT AT WHAT YOU'RE UP TO IN SOME WAY THAT'S
JIST AS GOOD AND AT THE SAME TIME DON'T BRING YOU INTO NO RESKS
AIN'T
THAT SO
YOU BET IT IS
BUT HOW YOU GOIN' TO MANAGE IT THIS TIME
WELL MY IDEA IS THIS WE'LL RUSTLE AROUND AND GATHER UP WHATEVER
PICKINS WE'VE OVERLOOKED IN THE STATEROOMS AND SHOVE FOR SHORE AND HIDE
THE TRUCK
THEN WE'LL WAIT
NOW I SAY IT AIN'T A GOIN' TO BE MORE'N TWO
HOURS BEFO' THIS WRACK BREAKS UP AND WASHES OFF DOWN THE RIVER
SEE
HE'LL BE DROWNDED AND WON'T HAVE NOBODY TO BLAME FOR IT BUT HIS OWN
SELF
I RECKON THAT'S A CONSIDERBLE SIGHT BETTER 'N KILLIN' OF HIM
I'M UNFAVORABLE TO KILLIN' A MAN AS LONG AS YOU CAN GIT AROUN' IT IT
AIN'T GOOD SENSE IT AIN'T GOOD MORALS
AIN'T I RIGHT
YES I RECK'N YOU ARE
BUT S'POSE SHE DON'T BREAK UP AND WASH OFF
WELL WE CAN WAIT THE TWO HOURS ANYWAY AND SEE CAN'T WE
ALL RIGHT THEN COME ALONG
SO THEY STARTED AND I LIT OUT ALL IN A COLD SWEAT AND SCRAMBLED
FORWARD
IT WAS DARK AS PITCH THERE BUT I SAID IN A KIND OF A COARSE
WHISPER JIM AND HE ANSWERED UP RIGHT AT MY ELBOW WITH A SORT OF A
MOAN AND I SAYS
QUICK JIM IT AIN'T NO TIME FOR FOOLING AROUND AND MOANING THERE'S A
GANG OF MURDERERS IN YONDER AND IF WE DON'T HUNT UP THEIR BOAT AND SET
HER DRIFTING DOWN THE RIVER SO THESE FELLOWS CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE
WRECK THERE'S ONE OF 'EM GOING TO BE IN A BAD FIX
BUT IF WE FIND THEIR
BOAT WE CAN PUT ALL OF 'EM IN A BAD FIX FOR THE SHERIFF 'LL GET 'EM
QUICK HURRY I'LL HUNT THE LABBOARD SIDE YOU HUNT THE STABBOARD
YOU
START AT THE RAFT AND
OH MY LORDY LORDY RAF' DEY AIN' NO RAF' NO MO' SHE DONE BROKE
LOOSE EN GONE I EN HERE WE IS
CHAPTER XIII
WELL I CATCHED MY BREATH AND MOST FAINTED
SHUT UP ON A WRECK WITH
SUCH A GANG AS THAT BUT IT WARN'T NO TIME TO BE SENTIMENTERING
WE'D
GOT TO FIND THAT BOAT NOW HAD TO HAVE IT FOR OURSELVES
SO WE WENT
A QUAKING AND SHAKING DOWN THE STABBOARD SIDE AND SLOW WORK IT WAS
TOO SEEMED A WEEK BEFORE WE GOT TO THE STERN
NO SIGN OF A BOAT
JIM
SAID HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE COULD GO ANY FURTHER SO SCARED HE HADN'T
HARDLY ANY STRENGTH LEFT HE SAID
BUT I SAID COME ON IF WE GET LEFT
ON THIS WRECK WE ARE IN A FIX SURE
SO ON WE PROWLED AGAIN
WE STRUCK
FOR THE STERN OF THE TEXAS AND FOUND IT AND THEN SCRABBLED ALONG
FORWARDS ON THE SKYLIGHT HANGING ON FROM SHUTTER TO SHUTTER FOR THE
EDGE OF THE SKYLIGHT WAS IN THE WATER
WHEN WE GOT PRETTY CLOSE TO THE
CROSS HALL DOOR THERE WAS THE SKIFF SURE ENOUGH I COULD JUST BARELY
SEE HER
I FELT EVER SO THANKFUL
IN ANOTHER SECOND I WOULD A BEEN
ABOARD OF HER BUT JUST THEN THE DOOR OPENED
ONE OF THE MEN STUCK HIS
HEAD OUT ONLY ABOUT A COUPLE OF FOOT FROM ME AND I THOUGHT I WAS GONE
BUT HE JERKED IT IN AGAIN AND SAYS
HEAVE THAT BLAME LANTERN OUT O' SIGHT BILL
HE FLUNG A BAG OF SOMETHING INTO THE BOAT AND THEN GOT IN HIMSELF AND
SET DOWN
IT WAS PACKARD
THEN BILL HE COME OUT AND GOT IN
PACKARD
SAYS IN A LOW VOICE
ALL READY SHOVE OFF
I COULDN'T HARDLY HANG ON TO THE SHUTTERS I WAS SO WEAK
BUT BILL
SAYS
HOLD ON 'D YOU GO THROUGH HIM
NO
DIDN'T YOU
NO
SO HE'S GOT HIS SHARE O' THE CASH YET
WELL THEN COME ALONG NO USE TO TAKE TRUCK AND LEAVE MONEY
SAY WON'T HE SUSPICION WHAT WE'RE UP TO
MAYBE HE WON'T
BUT WE GOT TO HAVE IT ANYWAY
COME ALONG
SO THEY GOT OUT AND WENT IN
THE DOOR SLAMMED TO BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE CAREENED SIDE AND IN A HALF
SECOND I WAS IN THE BOAT AND JIM COME TUMBLING AFTER ME
I OUT WITH MY
KNIFE AND CUT THE ROPE AND AWAY WE WENT
WE DIDN'T TOUCH AN OAR AND WE DIDN'T SPEAK NOR WHISPER NOR HARDLY EVEN
BREATHE
WE WENT GLIDING SWIFT ALONG DEAD SILENT PAST THE TIP OF THE
PADDLE BOX AND PAST THE STERN THEN IN A SECOND OR TWO MORE WE WAS A
HUNDRED YARDS BELOW THE WRECK AND THE DARKNESS SOAKED HER UP EVERY
LAST SIGN OF HER AND WE WAS SAFE AND KNOWED IT
WHEN WE WAS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YARDS DOWN STREAM WE SEE THE LANTERN
SHOW LIKE A LITTLE SPARK AT THE TEXAS DOOR FOR A SECOND AND WE KNOWED
BY THAT THAT THE RASCALS HAD MISSED THEIR BOAT AND WAS BEGINNING TO
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WAS IN JUST AS MUCH TROUBLE NOW AS JIM TURNER WAS
THEN JIM MANNED THE OARS AND WE TOOK OUT AFTER OUR RAFT
NOW WAS THE
FIRST TIME THAT I BEGUN TO WORRY ABOUT THE MEN I RECKON I HADN'T
HAD TIME TO BEFORE
I BEGUN TO THINK HOW DREADFUL IT WAS EVEN FOR
MURDERERS TO BE IN SUCH A FIX
I SAYS TO MYSELF THERE AIN'T NO
TELLING BUT I MIGHT COME TO BE A MURDERER MYSELF YET AND THEN HOW WOULD
I LIKE IT SO SAYS I TO JIM
THE FIRST LIGHT WE SEE WE'LL LAND A HUNDRED YARDS BELOW IT OR ABOVE
IT IN A PLACE WHERE IT'S A GOOD HIDING PLACE FOR YOU AND THE SKIFF AND
THEN I'LL GO AND FIX UP SOME KIND OF A YARN AND GET SOMEBODY TO GO FOR
THAT GANG AND GET THEM OUT OF THEIR SCRAPE SO THEY CAN BE HUNG WHEN
THEIR TIME COMES
BUT THAT IDEA WAS A FAILURE FOR PRETTY SOON IT BEGUN TO STORM AGAIN
AND THIS TIME WORSE THAN EVER
THE RAIN POURED DOWN AND NEVER A LIGHT
SHOWED EVERYBODY IN BED I RECKON
WE BOOMED ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
WATCHING FOR LIGHTS AND WATCHING FOR OUR RAFT
AFTER A LONG TIME THE
RAIN LET UP BUT THE CLOUDS STAYED AND THE LIGHTNING KEPT WHIMPERING
AND BY AND BY A FLASH SHOWED US A BLACK THING AHEAD FLOATING AND WE
MADE FOR IT
IT WAS THE RAFT AND MIGHTY GLAD WAS WE TO GET ABOARD OF IT AGAIN
WE
SEEN A LIGHT NOW AWAY DOWN TO THE RIGHT ON SHORE
SO I SAID I WOULD
GO FOR IT
THE SKIFF WAS HALF FULL OF PLUNDER WHICH THAT GANG HAD STOLE
THERE ON THE WRECK
WE HUSTLED IT ON TO THE RAFT IN A PILE AND I TOLD
JIM TO FLOAT ALONG DOWN AND SHOW A LIGHT WHEN HE JUDGED HE HAD GONE
ABOUT TWO MILE AND KEEP IT BURNING TILL I COME THEN I MANNED MY OARS
AND SHOVED FOR THE LIGHT
AS I GOT DOWN TOWARDS IT THREE OR FOUR MORE
SHOWED UP ON A HILLSIDE
IT WAS A VILLAGE
I CLOSED IN ABOVE THE SHORE
LIGHT AND LAID ON MY OARS AND FLOATED
AS I WENT BY I SEE IT WAS A
LANTERN HANGING ON THE JACKSTAFF OF A DOUBLE HULL FERRYBOAT
I SKIMMED
AROUND FOR THE WATCHMAN A WONDERING WHEREABOUTS HE SLEPT AND BY AND
BY I FOUND HIM ROOSTING ON THE BITTS FORWARD WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWEEN
HIS KNEES
I GAVE HIS SHOULDER TWO OR THREE LITTLE SHOVES AND BEGUN TO

WELL THEY DIDN'T GO THERE A PURPOSE
I BET THEY DIDN'T WHY GREAT GOODNESS THERE AIN'T NO CHANCE FOR 'EM
IF THEY DON'T GIT OFF MIGHTY QUICK WHY HOW IN THE NATION DID THEY
EVER GIT INTO SUCH A SCRAPE
EASY ENOUGH
MISS HOOKER WAS A VISITING UP THERE TO THE TOWN
YES BOOTH'S LANDING GO ON
SHE WAS A VISITING THERE AT BOOTH'S LANDING AND JUST IN THE EDGE OF
THE EVENING SHE STARTED OVER WITH HER NIGGER WOMAN IN THE HORSE FERRY
TO STAY ALL NIGHT AT HER FRIEND'S HOUSE MISS WHAT YOU MAY CALL HER I
DISREMEMBER HER NAME AND THEY LOST THEIR STEERING OAR AND SWUNG
AROUND AND WENT A FLOATING DOWN STERN FIRST ABOUT TWO MILE AND
SADDLE BAGGSED ON THE WRECK AND THE FERRYMAN AND THE NIGGER WOMAN AND
THE HORSES WAS ALL LOST BUT MISS HOOKER SHE MADE A GRAB AND GOT ABOARD
THE WRECK
WELL ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER DARK WE COME ALONG DOWN IN OUR
TRADING SCOW AND IT WAS SO DARK WE DIDN'T NOTICE THE WRECK TILL WE WAS
RIGHT ON IT AND SO WE SADDLE BAGGSED BUT ALL OF US WAS SAVED BUT
BILL WHIPPLE AND OH HE WAS THE BEST CRETUR I MOST WISH 'T IT HAD

SOMEHOW
I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD SWIM SO I MADE A DASH FOR IT
AND MISS HOOKER SHE SAID IF I DIDN'T STRIKE HELP SOONER COME HERE AND
HUNT UP HER UNCLE AND HE'D FIX THE THING
I MADE THE LAND ABOUT A MILE
BELOW AND BEEN FOOLING ALONG EVER SINCE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO DO
SOMETHING BUT THEY SAID 'WHAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AND SUCH A CURRENT

OVER YONDER WAY AND TURN OUT WEST WHEN YOU GIT THERE AND ABOUT A
QUARTER OF A MILE OUT YOU'LL COME TO THE TAVERN TELL 'EM TO DART YOU

AROUND ANY BECAUSE HE'LL WANT TO KNOW THE NEWS
TELL HIM I'LL HAVE
HIS NIECE ALL SAFE BEFORE HE CAN GET TO TOWN
HUMP YOURSELF NOW I'M
A GOING UP AROUND THE CORNER HERE TO ROUST OUT MY ENGINEER
I STRUCK FOR THE LIGHT BUT AS SOON AS HE TURNED THE CORNER I WENT BACK
AND GOT INTO MY SKIFF AND BAILED HER OUT AND THEN PULLED UP SHORE IN
THE EASY WATER ABOUT SIX HUNDRED YARDS AND TUCKED MYSELF IN AMONG
SOME WOODBOATS FOR I COULDN'T REST EASY TILL I COULD SEE THE FERRYBOAT
START
BUT TAKE IT ALL AROUND I WAS FEELING RUTHER COMFORTABLE ON
ACCOUNTS OF TAKING ALL THIS TROUBLE FOR THAT GANG FOR NOT MANY WOULD
A DONE IT
I WISHED THE WIDOW KNOWED ABOUT IT
I JUDGED SHE WOULD BE
PROUD OF ME FOR HELPING THESE RAPSCALLIONS BECAUSE RAPSCALLIONS AND
DEAD BEATS IS THE KIND THE WIDOW AND GOOD PEOPLE TAKES THE MOST INTEREST
IN
WELL BEFORE LONG HERE COMES THE WRECK DIM AND DUSKY SLIDING ALONG
DOWN A KIND OF COLD SHIVER WENT THROUGH ME AND THEN I STRUCK OUT FOR
HER
SHE WAS VERY DEEP AND I SEE IN A MINUTE THERE WARN'T MUCH CHANCE
FOR ANYBODY BEING ALIVE IN HER
I PULLED ALL AROUND HER AND HOLLERED
A LITTLE BUT THERE WASN'T ANY ANSWER ALL DEAD STILL
I FELT A LITTLE
BIT HEAVY HEARTED ABOUT THE GANG BUT NOT MUCH FOR I RECKONED IF THEY
COULD STAND IT I COULD
THEN HERE COMES THE FERRYBOAT SO I SHOVED FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER
ON A LONG DOWN STREAM SLANT AND WHEN I JUDGED I WAS OUT OF EYE REACH
I LAID ON MY OARS AND LOOKED BACK AND SEE HER GO AND SMELL AROUND THE
WRECK FOR MISS HOOKER'S REMAINDERS BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN WOULD KNOW HER
UNCLE HORNBACK WOULD WANT THEM AND THEN PRETTY SOON THE FERRYBOAT GIVE
IT UP AND WENT FOR THE SHORE AND I LAID INTO MY WORK AND WENT A BOOMING
DOWN THE RIVER
IT DID SEEM A POWERFUL LONG TIME BEFORE JIM'S LIGHT SHOWED UP AND WHEN
IT DID SHOW IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A THOUSAND MILE OFF
BY THE TIME I
GOT THERE THE SKY WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE GRAY IN THE EAST SO WE
STRUCK FOR AN ISLAND AND HID THE RAFT AND SUNK THE SKIFF AND TURNED
IN AND SLEPT LIKE DEAD PEOPLE
CHAPTER XIV
BY AND BY WHEN WE GOT UP WE TURNED OVER THE TRUCK THE GANG HAD STOLE
OFF OF THE WRECK AND FOUND BOOTS AND BLANKETS AND CLOTHES AND ALL
SORTS OF OTHER THINGS AND A LOT OF BOOKS AND A SPYGLASS AND THREE
BOXES OF SEEGARS

OUR LIVES
THE SEEGARS WAS PRIME

WOODS TALKING AND ME READING THE BOOKS AND HAVING A GENERAL GOOD
TIME
I TOLD JIM ALL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE WRECK AND AT THE
FERRYBOAT AND I SAID THESE KINDS OF THINGS WAS ADVENTURES BUT HE SAID
HE DIDN'T WANT NO MORE ADVENTURES
HE SAID THAT WHEN I WENT IN THE
TEXAS AND HE CRAWLED BACK TO GET ON THE RAFT AND FOUND HER GONE HE
NEARLY DIED BECAUSE HE JUDGED IT WAS ALL UP WITH HIM ANYWAY IT COULD
BE FIXED FOR IF HE DIDN'T GET SAVED HE WOULD GET DROWNDED AND IF HE
DID GET SAVED WHOEVER SAVED HIM WOULD SEND HIM BACK HOME SO AS TO GET
THE REWARD AND THEN MISS WATSON WOULD SELL HIM SOUTH SURE

CHAPTER XV
WE JUDGED THAT THREE NIGHTS MORE WOULD FETCH US TO CAIRO AT THE BOTTOM
OF ILLINOIS WHERE THE OHIO RIVER COMES IN AND THAT WAS WHAT WE WAS
AFTER
WE WOULD SELL THE RAFT AND GET ON A STEAMBOAT AND GO WAY UP THE
OHIO AMONGST THE FREE STATES AND THEN BE OUT OF TROUBLE
WELL THE SECOND NIGHT A FOG BEGUN TO COME ON AND WE MADE FOR A TOWHEAD
TO TIE TO FOR IT WOULDN'T DO TO TRY TO RUN IN A FOG BUT WHEN I PADDLED
AHEAD IN THE CANOE WITH THE LINE TO MAKE FAST THERE WARN'T ANYTHING
BUT LITTLE SAPLINGS TO TIE TO
I PASSED THE LINE AROUND ONE OF THEM
RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE CUT BANK BUT THERE WAS A STIFF CURRENT AND
THE RAFT COME BOOMING DOWN SO LIVELY SHE TORE IT OUT BY THE ROOTS AND
AWAY SHE WENT
I SEE THE FOG CLOSING DOWN AND IT MADE ME SO SICK AND
SCARED I COULDN'T BUDGE FOR MOST A HALF A MINUTE IT SEEMED TO ME AND
THEN THERE WARN'T NO RAFT IN SIGHT YOU COULDN'T SEE TWENTY YARDS
I
JUMPED INTO THE CANOE AND RUN BACK TO THE STERN AND GRABBED THE PADDLE
AND SET HER BACK A STROKE
BUT SHE DIDN'T COME
I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY
I HADN'T UNTIED HER
I GOT UP AND TRIED TO UNTIE HER BUT I WAS SO
EXCITED MY HANDS SHOOK SO I COULDN'T HARDLY DO ANYTHING WITH THEM
AS SOON AS I GOT STARTED I TOOK OUT AFTER THE RAFT HOT AND HEAVY RIGHT
DOWN THE TOWHEAD
THAT WAS ALL RIGHT AS FAR AS IT WENT BUT THE TOWHEAD
WARN'T SIXTY YARDS LONG AND THE MINUTE I FLEW BY THE FOOT OF IT I SHOT
OUT INTO THE SOLID WHITE FOG AND HADN'T NO MORE IDEA WHICH WAY I WAS
GOING THAN A DEAD MAN
THINKS I IT WON'T DO TO PADDLE FIRST I KNOW I'LL RUN INTO THE BANK
OR A TOWHEAD OR SOMETHING I GOT TO SET STILL AND FLOAT AND YET IT'S
MIGHTY FIDGETY BUSINESS TO HAVE TO HOLD YOUR HANDS STILL AT SUCH A TIME
I WHOOPED AND LISTENED
AWAY DOWN THERE SOMEWHERES I HEARS A SMALL
WHOOP AND UP COMES MY SPIRITS
I WENT TEARING AFTER IT LISTENING
SHARP TO HEAR IT AGAIN
THE NEXT TIME IT COME I SEE I WARN'T HEADING
FOR IT BUT HEADING AWAY TO THE RIGHT OF IT
AND THE NEXT TIME I WAS
HEADING AWAY TO THE LEFT OF IT AND NOT GAINING ON IT MUCH EITHER FOR
I WAS FLYING AROUND THIS WAY AND THAT AND T'OTHER BUT IT WAS GOING
STRAIGHT AHEAD ALL THE TIME
I DID WISH THE FOOL WOULD THINK TO BEAT A TIN PAN AND BEAT IT ALL THE
TIME BUT HE NEVER DID AND IT WAS THE STILL PLACES BETWEEN THE WHOOPS
THAT WAS MAKING THE TROUBLE FOR ME
WELL I FOUGHT ALONG AND DIRECTLY
I HEARS THE WHOOP BEHIND ME
I WAS TANGLED GOOD NOW
THAT WAS
SOMEBODY ELSE'S WHOOP OR ELSE I WAS TURNED AROUND
I THROWED THE PADDLE DOWN
I HEARD THE WHOOP AGAIN IT WAS BEHIND ME
YET BUT IN A DIFFERENT PLACE IT KEPT COMING AND KEPT CHANGING ITS
PLACE AND I KEPT ANSWERING TILL BY AND BY IT WAS IN FRONT OF ME AGAIN
AND I KNOWED THE CURRENT HAD SWUNG THE CANOE'S HEAD DOWN STREAM AND I
WAS ALL RIGHT IF THAT WAS JIM AND NOT SOME OTHER RAFTSMAN HOLLERING
I COULDN'T TELL NOTHING ABOUT VOICES IN A FOG FOR NOTHING DON'T LOOK
NATURAL NOR SOUND NATURAL IN A FOG
THE WHOOPING WENT ON AND IN ABOUT A MINUTE I COME A BOOMING DOWN ON A
CUT BANK WITH SMOKY GHOSTS OF BIG TREES ON IT AND THE CURRENT THROWED
ME OFF TO THE LEFT AND SHOT BY AMONGST A LOT OF SNAGS THAT FAIRLY
ROARED THE CURRRENT WAS TEARING BY THEM SO SWIFT
IN ANOTHER SECOND OR TWO IT WAS SOLID WHITE AND STILL AGAIN
I SET
PERFECTLY STILL THEN LISTENING TO MY HEART THUMP AND I RECKON I DIDN'T
DRAW A BREATH WHILE IT THUMPED A HUNDRED
I JUST GIVE UP THEN
I KNOWED WHAT THE MATTER WAS
THAT CUT BANK
WAS AN ISLAND AND JIM HAD GONE DOWN T'OTHER SIDE OF IT
IT WARN'T NO
TOWHEAD THAT YOU COULD FLOAT BY IN TEN MINUTES
IT HAD THE BIG TIMBER
OF A REGULAR ISLAND IT MIGHT BE FIVE OR SIX MILES LONG AND MORE THAN
HALF A MILE WIDE
I KEPT QUIET WITH MY EARS COCKED ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES I RECKON
I
WAS FLOATING ALONG OF COURSE FOUR OR FIVE MILES AN HOUR BUT YOU DON'T
EVER THINK OF THAT
NO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE LAYING DEAD STILL ON
THE WATER AND IF A LITTLE GLIMPSE OF A SNAG SLIPS BY YOU DON'T THINK TO
YOURSELF HOW FAST YOU'RE GOING BUT YOU CATCH YOUR BREATH AND THINK
MY HOW THAT SNAG'S TEARING ALONG
IF YOU THINK IT AIN'T DISMAL AND
LONESOME OUT IN A FOG THAT WAY BY YOURSELF IN THE NIGHT YOU TRY IT
ONCE YOU'LL SEE
NEXT FOR ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR I WHOOPS NOW AND THEN AT LAST I HEARS
THE ANSWER A LONG WAYS OFF AND TRIES TO FOLLOW IT BUT I COULDN'T DO
IT AND DIRECTLY I JUDGED I'D GOT INTO A NEST OF TOWHEADS FOR I HAD
LITTLE DIM GLIMPSES OF THEM ON BOTH SIDES OF ME SOMETIMES JUST A NARROW
CHANNEL BETWEEN AND SOME THAT I COULDN'T SEE I KNOWED WAS THERE BECAUSE
I'D HEAR THE WASH OF THE CURRENT AGAINST THE OLD DEAD BRUSH AND TRASH
THAT HUNG OVER THE BANKS
WELL I WARN'T LONG LOOSING THE WHOOPS DOWN
AMONGST THE TOWHEADS AND I ONLY TRIED TO CHASE THEM A LITTLE WHILE
ANYWAY BECAUSE IT WAS WORSE THAN CHASING A JACK O' LANTERN
YOU NEVER
KNOWED A SOUND DODGE AROUND SO AND SWAP PLACES SO QUICK AND SO MUCH
I HAD TO CLAW AWAY FROM THE BANK PRETTY LIVELY FOUR OR FIVE TIMES TO
KEEP FROM KNOCKING THE ISLANDS OUT OF THE RIVER AND SO I JUDGED THE
RAFT MUST BE BUTTING INTO THE BANK EVERY NOW AND THEN OR ELSE IT WOULD
GET FURTHER AHEAD AND CLEAR OUT OF HEARING IT WAS FLOATING A LITTLE
FASTER THAN WHAT I WAS
WELL I SEEMED TO BE IN THE OPEN RIVER AGAIN BY AND BY BUT I COULDN'T
HEAR NO SIGN OF A WHOOP NOWHERES
I RECKONED JIM HAD FETCHED UP ON A
SNAG MAYBE AND IT WAS ALL UP WITH HIM
I WAS GOOD AND TIRED SO I
LAID DOWN IN THE CANOE AND SAID I WOULDN'T BOTHER NO MORE
I DIDN'T
WANT TO GO TO SLEEP OF COURSE BUT I WAS SO SLEEPY I COULDN'T HELP IT
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE JEST ONE LITTLE CAT NAP
BUT I RECKON IT WAS MORE THAN A CAT NAP FOR WHEN I WAKED UP THE STARS
WAS SHINING BRIGHT THE FOG WAS ALL GONE AND I WAS SPINNING DOWN A
BIG BEND STERN FIRST
FIRST I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS I THOUGHT I WAS
DREAMING AND WHEN THINGS BEGAN TO COME BACK TO ME THEY SEEMED TO COME
UP DIM OUT OF LAST WEEK
IT WAS A MONSTROUS BIG RIVER HERE WITH THE TALLEST AND THE THICKEST
KIND OF TIMBER ON BOTH BANKS JUST A SOLID WALL AS WELL AS I COULD SEE
BY THE STARS
I LOOKED AWAY DOWN STREAM AND SEEN A BLACK SPECK ON THE
WATER
I TOOK AFTER IT BUT WHEN I GOT TO IT IT WARN'T NOTHING BUT A
COUPLE OF SAWLOGS MADE FAST TOGETHER
THEN I SEE ANOTHER SPECK AND
CHASED THAT THEN ANOTHER AND THIS TIME I WAS RIGHT
IT WAS THE RAFT
WHEN I GOT TO IT JIM WAS SETTING THERE WITH HIS HEAD DOWN BETWEEN HIS
KNEES ASLEEP WITH HIS RIGHT ARM HANGING OVER THE STEERING OAR
THE
OTHER OAR WAS SMASHED OFF AND THE RAFT WAS LITTERED UP WITH LEAVES AND
BRANCHES AND DIRT
SO SHE'D HAD A ROUGH TIME
I MADE FAST AND LAID DOWN UNDER JIM'S NOSE ON THE RAFT AND BEGAN TO
GAP AND STRETCH MY FISTS OUT AGAINST JIM AND SAYS
HELLO JIM HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP WHY DIDN'T YOU STIR ME UP

OH WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT BECAUSE A DREAM DOES TIRE A BODY LIKE
EVERYTHING SOMETIMES
BUT THIS ONE WAS A STAVING DREAM TELL ME ALL
ABOUT IT JIM
SO JIM WENT TO WORK AND TOLD ME THE WHOLE THING RIGHT THROUGH JUST AS
IT HAPPENED ONLY HE PAINTED IT UP CONSIDERABLE
THEN HE SAID HE MUST
START IN AND 'TERPRET IT BECAUSE IT WAS SENT FOR A WARNING
HE SAID
THE FIRST TOWHEAD STOOD FOR A MAN THAT WOULD TRY TO DO US SOME GOOD BUT
THE CURRENT WAS ANOTHER MAN THAT WOULD GET US AWAY FROM HIM
THE WHOOPS
WAS WARNINGS THAT WOULD COME TO US EVERY NOW AND THEN AND IF WE DIDN'T
TRY HARD TO MAKE OUT TO UNDERSTAND THEM THEY'D JUST TAKE US INTO BAD
LUCK 'STEAD OF KEEPING US OUT OF IT
THE LOT OF TOWHEADS WAS TROUBLES
WE WAS GOING TO GET INTO WITH QUARRELSOME PEOPLE AND ALL KINDS OF MEAN
FOLKS BUT IF WE MINDED OUR BUSINESS AND DIDN'T TALK BACK AND AGGRAVATE
THEM WE WOULD PULL THROUGH AND GET OUT OF THE FOG AND INTO THE BIG
CLEAR RIVER WHICH WAS THE FREE STATES AND WOULDN'T HAVE NO MORE
TROUBLE
IT HAD CLOUDED UP PRETTY DARK JUST AFTER I GOT ON TO THE RAFT BUT IT
WAS CLEARING UP AGAIN NOW
OH WELL THAT'S ALL INTERPRETED WELL ENOUGH AS FAR AS IT GOES JIM I
SAYS BUT WHAT DOES THESE THINGS STAND FOR
IT WAS THE LEAVES AND RUBBISH ON THE RAFT AND THE SMASHED OAR
YOU
COULD SEE THEM FIRST RATE NOW
JIM LOOKED AT THE TRASH AND THEN LOOKED AT ME AND BACK AT THE TRASH
AGAIN
HE HAD GOT THE DREAM FIXED SO STRONG IN HIS HEAD THAT HE
COULDN'T SEEM TO SHAKE IT LOOSE AND GET THE FACTS BACK INTO ITS PLACE
AGAIN RIGHT AWAY
BUT WHEN HE DID GET THE THING STRAIGHTENED AROUND HE
LOOKED AT ME STEADY WITHOUT EVER SMILING AND SAYS

THEN HE GOT UP SLOW AND WALKED TO THE WIGWAM AND WENT IN THERE WITHOUT
SAYING ANYTHING BUT THAT
BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
IT MADE ME FEEL SO MEAN
I COULD ALMOST KISSED HIS FOOT TO GET HIM TO TAKE IT BACK
IT WAS FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE I COULD WORK MYSELF UP TO GO AND HUMBLE
MYSELF TO A NIGGER BUT I DONE IT AND I WARN'T EVER SORRY FOR IT
AFTERWARDS NEITHER
I DIDN'T DO HIM NO MORE MEAN TRICKS AND I
WOULDN'T DONE THAT ONE IF I'D A KNOWED IT WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL THAT WAY
CHAPTER XVI
WE SLEPT MOST ALL DAY AND STARTED OUT AT NIGHT A LITTLE WAYS BEHIND A
MONSTROUS LONG RAFT THAT WAS AS LONG GOING BY AS A PROCESSION
SHE HAD
FOUR LONG SWEEPS AT EACH END SO WE JUDGED SHE CARRIED AS MANY AS THIRTY
MEN LIKELY
SHE HAD FIVE BIG WIGWAMS ABOARD WIDE APART AND AN OPEN
CAMP FIRE IN THE MIDDLE AND A TALL FLAG POLE AT EACH END
THERE WAS A
POWER OF STYLE ABOUT HER
IT AMOUNTED TO SOMETHING BEING A RAFTSMAN
ON SUCH A CRAFT AS THAT
WE WENT DRIFTING DOWN INTO A BIG BEND AND THE NIGHT CLOUDED UP AND GOT
HOT
THE RIVER WAS VERY WIDE AND WAS WALLED WITH SOLID TIMBER ON
BOTH SIDES YOU COULDN'T SEE A BREAK IN IT HARDLY EVER OR A LIGHT
WE
TALKED ABOUT CAIRO AND WONDERED WHETHER WE WOULD KNOW IT WHEN WE GOT TO
IT
I SAID LIKELY WE WOULDN'T BECAUSE I HAD HEARD SAY THERE WARN'T BUT
ABOUT A DOZEN HOUSES THERE AND IF THEY DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE THEM LIT
UP HOW WAS WE GOING TO KNOW WE WAS PASSING A TOWN JIM SAID IF THE TWO
BIG RIVERS JOINED TOGETHER THERE THAT WOULD SHOW
BUT I SAID MAYBE
WE MIGHT THINK WE WAS PASSING THE FOOT OF AN ISLAND AND COMING INTO THE
SAME OLD RIVER AGAIN
THAT DISTURBED JIM AND ME TOO
SO THE QUESTION
WAS WHAT TO DO I SAID PADDLE ASHORE THE FIRST TIME A LIGHT SHOWED
AND TELL THEM PAP WAS BEHIND COMING ALONG WITH A TRADING SCOW AND
WAS A GREEN HAND AT THE BUSINESS AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR IT WAS TO
CAIRO
JIM THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SO WE TOOK A SMOKE ON IT AND
WAITED
THERE WARN'T NOTHING TO DO NOW BUT TO LOOK OUT SHARP FOR THE TOWN AND
NOT PASS IT WITHOUT SEEING IT
HE SAID HE'D BE MIGHTY SURE TO SEE IT
BECAUSE HE'D BE A FREE MAN THE MINUTE HE SEEN IT BUT IF HE MISSED IT
HE'D BE IN A SLAVE COUNTRY AGAIN AND NO MORE SHOW FOR FREEDOM
EVERY
LITTLE WHILE HE JUMPS UP AND SAYS
DAH SHE IS
BUT IT WARN'T
IT WAS JACK O' LANTERNS OR LIGHTNING BUGS SO HE SET
DOWN AGAIN AND WENT TO WATCHING SAME AS BEFORE
JIM SAID IT MADE HIM
ALL OVER TREMBLY AND FEVERISH TO BE SO CLOSE TO FREEDOM
WELL I CAN
TELL YOU IT MADE ME ALL OVER TREMBLY AND FEVERISH TOO TO HEAR HIM
BECAUSE I BEGUN TO GET IT THROUGH MY HEAD THAT HE WAS MOST FREE AND
WHO WAS TO BLAME FOR IT WHY ME
I COULDN'T GET THAT OUT OF MY
CONSCIENCE NO HOW NOR NO WAY
IT GOT TO TROUBLING ME SO I COULDN'T
REST I COULDN'T STAY STILL IN ONE PLACE
IT HADN'T EVER COME HOME TO
ME BEFORE WHAT THIS THING WAS THAT I WAS DOING
BUT NOW IT DID AND IT
STAYED WITH ME AND SCORCHED ME MORE AND MORE
I TRIED TO MAKE OUT TO
MYSELF THAT I WARN'T TO BLAME BECAUSE I DIDN'T RUN JIM OFF FROM HIS
RIGHTFUL OWNER BUT IT WARN'T NO USE CONSCIENCE UP AND SAYS EVERY
TIME BUT YOU KNOWED HE WAS RUNNING FOR HIS FREEDOM AND YOU COULD A
PADDLED ASHORE AND TOLD SOMEBODY THAT WAS SO I COULDN'T GET AROUND
THAT NOWAY
THAT WAS WHERE IT PINCHED
CONSCIENCE SAYS TO ME WHAT
HAD POOR MISS WATSON DONE TO YOU THAT YOU COULD SEE HER NIGGER GO OFF
RIGHT UNDER YOUR EYES AND NEVER SAY ONE SINGLE WORD WHAT DID THAT POOR
OLD WOMAN DO TO YOU THAT YOU COULD TREAT HER SO MEAN WHY SHE TRIED TO
LEARN YOU YOUR BOOK SHE TRIED TO LEARN YOU YOUR MANNERS SHE TRIED TO
BE GOOD TO YOU EVERY WAY SHE KNOWED HOW
THAT'S WHAT SHE DONE
I GOT TO FEELING SO MEAN AND SO MISERABLE I MOST WISHED I WAS DEAD
I
FIDGETED UP AND DOWN THE RAFT ABUSING MYSELF TO MYSELF AND JIM WAS
FIDGETING UP AND DOWN PAST ME
WE NEITHER OF US COULD KEEP STILL
EVERY TIME HE DANCED AROUND AND SAYS DAH'S CAIRO IT WENT THROUGH ME
LIKE A SHOT AND I THOUGHT IF IT WAS CAIRO I RECKONED I WOULD DIE OF
MISERABLENESS
JIM TALKED OUT LOUD ALL THE TIME WHILE I WAS TALKING TO MYSELF
HE WAS
SAYING HOW THE FIRST THING HE WOULD DO WHEN HE GOT TO A FREE STATE HE
WOULD GO TO SAVING UP MONEY AND NEVER SPEND A SINGLE CENT AND WHEN HE
GOT ENOUGH HE WOULD BUY HIS WIFE WHICH WAS OWNED ON A FARM CLOSE TO
WHERE MISS WATSON LIVED AND THEN THEY WOULD BOTH WORK TO BUY THE
TWO CHILDREN AND IF THEIR MASTER WOULDN'T SELL THEM THEY'D GET AN
AB'LITIONIST TO GO AND STEAL THEM
IT MOST FROZE ME TO HEAR SUCH TALK
HE WOULDN'T EVER DARED TO TALK SUCH
TALK IN HIS LIFE BEFORE
JUST SEE WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN HIM THE
MINUTE HE JUDGED HE WAS ABOUT FREE
IT WAS ACCORDING TO THE OLD SAYING
GIVE A NIGGER AN INCH AND HE'LL TAKE AN ELL THINKS I THIS IS WHAT
COMES OF MY NOT THINKING
HERE WAS THIS NIGGER WHICH I HAD AS GOOD
AS HELPED TO RUN AWAY COMING RIGHT OUT FLAT FOOTED AND SAYING HE WOULD
STEAL HIS CHILDREN CHILDREN THAT BELONGED TO A MAN I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW A
MAN THAT HADN'T EVER DONE ME NO HARM
I WAS SORRY TO HEAR JIM SAY THAT IT WAS SUCH A LOWERING OF HIM
MY
CONSCIENCE GOT TO STIRRING ME UP HOTTER THAN EVER UNTIL AT LAST I SAYS
TO IT LET UP ON ME IT AIN'T TOO LATE YET I'LL PADDLE ASHORE AT THE
FIRST LIGHT AND TELL I FELT EASY AND HAPPY AND LIGHT AS A FEATHER

THEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE MONEY
IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD RAISE TWENTY
DOLLARS APIECE
JIM SAID WE COULD TAKE DECK PASSAGE ON A STEAMBOAT
NOW AND THE MONEY WOULD LAST US AS FAR AS WE WANTED TO GO IN THE FREE
STATES
HE SAID TWENTY MILE MORE WARN'T FAR FOR THE RAFT TO GO BUT HE
WISHED WE WAS ALREADY THERE
TOWARDS DAYBREAK WE TIED UP AND JIM WAS MIGHTY PARTICULAR ABOUT HIDING
THE RAFT GOOD
THEN HE WORKED ALL DAY FIXING THINGS IN BUNDLES AND
GETTING ALL READY TO QUIT RAFTING
THAT NIGHT ABOUT TEN WE HOVE IN SIGHT OF THE LIGHTS OF A TOWN AWAY DOWN
IN A LEFT HAND BEND
I WENT OFF IN THE CANOE TO ASK ABOUT IT
PRETTY SOON I FOUND A MAN OUT
IN THE RIVER WITH A SKIFF SETTING A TROT LINE
I RANGED UP AND SAYS
MISTER IS THAT TOWN CAIRO
CAIRO NO
YOU MUST BE A BLAME' FOOL
WHAT TOWN IS IT MISTER
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW GO AND FIND OUT
IF YOU STAY HERE BOTHERIN'
AROUND ME FOR ABOUT A HALF A MINUTE LONGER YOU'LL GET SOMETHING YOU
WON'T WANT
I PADDLED TO THE RAFT
JIM WAS AWFUL DISAPPOINTED BUT I SAID NEVER
MIND CAIRO WOULD BE THE NEXT PLACE I RECKONED
WE PASSED ANOTHER TOWN BEFORE DAYLIGHT AND I WAS GOING OUT AGAIN BUT
IT WAS HIGH GROUND SO I DIDN'T GO
NO HIGH GROUND ABOUT CAIRO JIM
SAID
I HAD FORGOT IT
WE LAID UP FOR THE DAY ON A TOWHEAD TOLERABLE
CLOSE TO THE LEFT HAND BANK
I BEGUN TO SUSPICION SOMETHING
SO DID
JIM
I SAYS
MAYBE WE WENT BY CAIRO IN THE FOG THAT NIGHT
HE SAYS
DOAN' LE'S TALK ABOUT IT HUCK
PO' NIGGERS CAN'T HAVE NO LUCK
I
AWLUZ 'SPECTED DAT RATTLESNAKE SKIN WARN'T DONE WID ITS WORK
I WISH I'D NEVER SEEN THAT SNAKE SKIN JIM I DO WISH I'D NEVER LAID
EYES ON IT
IT AIN'T YO' FAULT HUCK YOU DIDN' KNOW
DON'T YOU BLAME YO'SELF
'BOUT IT
WHEN IT WAS DAYLIGHT HERE WAS THE CLEAR OHIO WATER INSHORE SURE
ENOUGH AND OUTSIDE WAS THE OLD REGULAR MUDDY SO IT WAS ALL UP WITH
CAIRO
WE TALKED IT ALL OVER
IT WOULDN'T DO TO TAKE TO THE SHORE WE COULDN'T
TAKE THE RAFT UP THE STREAM OF COURSE
THERE WARN'T NO WAY BUT TO WAIT
FOR DARK AND START BACK IN THE CANOE AND TAKE THE CHANCES
SO WE SLEPT
ALL DAY AMONGST THE COTTONWOOD THICKET SO AS TO BE FRESH FOR THE WORK
AND WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE RAFT ABOUT DARK THE CANOE WAS GONE
WE DIDN'T SAY A WORD FOR A GOOD WHILE
THERE WARN'T ANYTHING TO
SAY
WE BOTH KNOWED WELL ENOUGH IT WAS SOME MORE WORK OF THE
RATTLESNAKE SKIN SO WHAT WAS THE USE TO TALK ABOUT IT IT WOULD ONLY
LOOK LIKE WE WAS FINDING FAULT AND THAT WOULD BE BOUND TO FETCH MORE
BAD LUCK AND KEEP ON FETCHING IT TOO TILL WE KNOWED ENOUGH TO KEEP
STILL
BY AND BY WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE BETTER DO AND FOUND THERE WARN'T NO
WAY BUT JUST TO GO ALONG DOWN WITH THE RAFT TILL WE GOT A CHANCE TO BUY
A CANOE TO GO BACK IN
WE WARN'T GOING TO BORROW IT WHEN THERE WARN'T
ANYBODY AROUND THE WAY PAP WOULD DO FOR THAT MIGHT SET PEOPLE AFTER
US
SO WE SHOVED OUT AFTER DARK ON THE RAFT
ANYBODY THAT DON'T BELIEVE YET THAT IT'S FOOLISHNESS TO HANDLE A
SNAKE SKIN AFTER ALL THAT THAT SNAKE SKIN DONE FOR US WILL BELIEVE IT
NOW IF THEY READ ON AND SEE WHAT MORE IT DONE FOR US
THE PLACE TO BUY CANOES IS OFF OF RAFTS LAYING UP AT SHORE
BUT WE
DIDN'T SEE NO RAFTS LAYING UP SO WE WENT ALONG DURING THREE HOURS AND
MORE
WELL THE NIGHT GOT GRAY AND RUTHER THICK WHICH IS THE NEXT
MEANEST THING TO FOG
YOU CAN'T TELL THE SHAPE OF THE RIVER AND YOU
CAN'T SEE NO DISTANCE
IT GOT TO BE VERY LATE AND STILL AND THEN ALONG
COMES A STEAMBOAT UP THE RIVER
WE LIT THE LANTERN AND JUDGED SHE
WOULD SEE IT
UP STREAM BOATS DIDN'T GENERLY COME CLOSE TO US THEY
GO OUT AND FOLLOW THE BARS AND HUNT FOR EASY WATER UNDER THE REEFS BUT
NIGHTS LIKE THIS THEY BULL RIGHT UP THE CHANNEL AGAINST THE WHOLE RIVER
WE COULD HEAR HER POUNDING ALONG BUT WE DIDN'T SEE HER GOOD TILL SHE
WAS CLOSE
SHE AIMED RIGHT FOR US
OFTEN THEY DO THAT AND TRY TO SEE
HOW CLOSE THEY CAN COME WITHOUT TOUCHING SOMETIMES THE WHEEL BITES OFF
A SWEEP AND THEN THE PILOT STICKS HIS HEAD OUT AND LAUGHS AND THINKS
HE'S MIGHTY SMART
WELL HERE SHE COMES AND WE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO
TRY AND SHAVE US BUT SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE SHEERING OFF A BIT
SHE
WAS A BIG ONE AND SHE WAS COMING IN A HURRY TOO LOOKING LIKE A BLACK
CLOUD WITH ROWS OF GLOW WORMS AROUND IT BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE BULGED
OUT BIG AND SCARY WITH A LONG ROW OF WIDE OPEN FURNACE DOORS SHINING
LIKE RED HOT TEETH AND HER MONSTROUS BOWS AND GUARDS HANGING RIGHT
OVER US
THERE WAS A YELL AT US AND A JINGLING OF BELLS TO STOP THE
ENGINES A POWWOW OF CUSSING AND WHISTLING OF STEAM AND AS JIM WENT
OVERBOARD ON ONE SIDE AND I ON THE OTHER SHE COME SMASHING STRAIGHT
THROUGH THE RAFT
I DIVED AND I AIMED TO FIND THE BOTTOM TOO FOR A THIRTY FOOT WHEEL
HAD GOT TO GO OVER ME AND I WANTED IT TO HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM
I COULD
ALWAYS STAY UNDER WATER A MINUTE THIS TIME I RECKON I STAYED UNDER A
MINUTE AND A HALF
THEN I BOUNCED FOR THE TOP IN A HURRY FOR I WAS
NEARLY BUSTING
I POPPED OUT TO MY ARMPITS AND BLOWED THE WATER OUT OF
MY NOSE AND PUFFED A BIT
OF COURSE THERE WAS A BOOMING CURRENT AND
OF COURSE THAT BOAT STARTED HER ENGINES AGAIN TEN SECONDS AFTER SHE
STOPPED THEM FOR THEY NEVER CARED MUCH FOR RAFTSMEN SO NOW SHE WAS
CHURNING ALONG UP THE RIVER OUT OF SIGHT IN THE THICK WEATHER THOUGH I
COULD HEAR HER
I SUNG OUT FOR JIM ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES BUT I DIDN'T GET ANY ANSWER
SO I GRABBED A PLANK THAT TOUCHED ME WHILE I WAS TREADING WATER AND
STRUCK OUT FOR SHORE SHOVING IT AHEAD OF ME
BUT I MADE OUT TO SEE
THAT THE DRIFT OF THE CURRENT WAS TOWARDS THE LEFT HAND SHORE WHICH
MEANT THAT I WAS IN A CROSSING SO I CHANGED OFF AND WENT THAT WAY
IT WAS ONE OF THESE LONG SLANTING TWO MILE CROSSINGS SO I WAS A GOOD
LONG TIME IN GETTING OVER
I MADE A SAFE LANDING AND CLUMB UP THE
BANK
I COULDN'T SEE BUT A LITTLE WAYS BUT I WENT POKING ALONG OVER
ROUGH GROUND FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE OR MORE AND THEN I RUN ACROSS A
BIG OLD FASHIONED DOUBLE LOG HOUSE BEFORE I NOTICED IT
I WAS GOING TO
RUSH BY AND GET AWAY BUT A LOT OF DOGS JUMPED OUT AND WENT TO HOWLING
AND BARKING AT ME AND I KNOWED BETTER THAN TO MOVE ANOTHER PEG
CHAPTER XVII

THEN IT WAS MOST DAYLIGHT AND EVERYBODY WENT TO BED AND I

NEXT AND SO I WANTED TO BE HANDY WITH IT AND RATTLE IT OFF LIKE I WAS
USED TO IT
IT WAS A MIGHTY NICE FAMILY AND A MIGHTY NICE HOUSE TOO
I HADN'T
SEEN NO HOUSE OUT IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE THAT WAS SO NICE AND HAD SO MUCH
STYLE
IT DIDN'T HAVE AN IRON LATCH ON THE FRONT DOOR NOR A WOODEN ONE
WITH A BUCKSKIN STRING BUT A BRASS KNOB TO TURN THE SAME AS HOUSES IN
TOWN
THERE WARN'T NO BED IN THE PARLOR NOR A SIGN OF A BED BUT HEAPS
OF PARLORS IN TOWNS HAS BEDS IN THEM
THERE WAS A BIG FIREPLACE THAT
WAS BRICKED ON THE BOTTOM AND THE BRICKS WAS KEPT CLEAN AND RED BY
POURING WATER ON THEM AND SCRUBBING THEM WITH ANOTHER BRICK SOMETIMES
THEY WASH THEM OVER WITH RED WATER PAINT THAT THEY CALL SPANISH BROWN
SAME AS THEY DO IN TOWN
THEY HAD BIG BRASS DOG IRONS THAT COULD HOLD
UP A SAW LOG
THERE WAS A CLOCK ON THE MIDDLE OF THE MANTELPIECE WITH
A PICTURE OF A TOWN PAINTED ON THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE GLASS FRONT AND
A ROUND PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT FOR THE SUN AND YOU COULD SEE THE
PENDULUM SWINGING BEHIND IT
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO HEAR THAT CLOCK TICK
AND SOMETIMES WHEN ONE OF THESE PEDDLERS HAD BEEN ALONG AND SCOURED HER
UP AND GOT HER IN GOOD SHAPE SHE WOULD START IN AND STRIKE A HUNDRED
AND FIFTY BEFORE SHE GOT TUCKERED OUT
THEY WOULDN'T TOOK ANY MONEY FOR
HER
WELL THERE WAS A BIG OUTLANDISH PARROT ON EACH SIDE OF THE CLOCK
MADE OUT OF SOMETHING LIKE CHALK AND PAINTED UP GAUDY
BY ONE OF THE
PARROTS WAS A CAT MADE OF CROCKERY AND A CROCKERY DOG BY THE OTHER
AND WHEN YOU PRESSED DOWN ON THEM THEY SQUEAKED BUT DIDN'T OPEN
THEIR MOUTHS NOR LOOK DIFFERENT NOR INTERESTED
THEY SQUEAKED THROUGH
UNDERNEATH
THERE WAS A COUPLE OF BIG WILD TURKEY WING FANS SPREAD OUT
BEHIND THOSE THINGS
ON THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WAS A KIND
OF A LOVELY CROCKERY BASKET THAT HAD APPLES AND ORANGES AND PEACHES AND
GRAPES PILED UP IN IT WHICH WAS MUCH REDDER AND YELLOWER AND PRETTIER
THAN REAL ONES IS BUT THEY WARN'T REAL BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE WHERE
PIECES HAD GOT CHIPPED OFF AND SHOWED THE WHITE CHALK OR WHATEVER IT
WAS UNDERNEATH
THIS TABLE HAD A COVER MADE OUT OF BEAUTIFUL OILCLOTH WITH A RED AND
BLUE SPREAD EAGLE PAINTED ON IT AND A PAINTED BORDER ALL AROUND
IT
COME ALL THE WAY FROM PHILADELPHIA THEY SAID
THERE WAS SOME BOOKS
TOO PILED UP PERFECTLY EXACT ON EACH CORNER OF THE TABLE
ONE WAS A
BIG FAMILY BIBLE FULL OF PICTURES
ONE WAS PILGRIM'S PROGRESS ABOUT A
MAN THAT LEFT HIS FAMILY IT DIDN'T SAY WHY
I READ CONSIDERABLE IN IT
NOW AND THEN
THE STATEMENTS WAS INTERESTING BUT TOUGH
ANOTHER WAS
FRIENDSHIP'S OFFERING FULL OF BEAUTIFUL STUFF AND POETRY BUT I DIDN'T
READ THE POETRY
ANOTHER WAS HENRY CLAY'S SPEECHES AND ANOTHER WAS DR
GUNN'S FAMILY MEDICINE WHICH TOLD YOU ALL ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF A BODY
WAS SICK OR DEAD
THERE WAS A HYMN BOOK AND A LOT OF OTHER BOOKS
AND
THERE WAS NICE SPLIT BOTTOM CHAIRS AND PERFECTLY SOUND TOO NOT BAGGED
DOWN IN THE MIDDLE AND BUSTED LIKE AN OLD BASKET
THEY HAD PICTURES HUNG ON THE WALLS MAINLY WASHINGTONS AND LAFAYETTES
AND BATTLES AND HIGHLAND MARYS AND ONE CALLED SIGNING THE
DECLARATION THERE WAS SOME THAT THEY CALLED CRAYONS WHICH ONE OF THE
DAUGHTERS WHICH WAS DEAD MADE HER OWN SELF WHEN SHE WAS ONLY
FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
THEY WAS DIFFERENT FROM ANY PICTURES I EVER SEE
BEFORE BLACKER MOSTLY THAN IS COMMON
ONE WAS A WOMAN IN A SLIM BLACK
DRESS BELTED SMALL UNDER THE ARMPITS WITH BULGES LIKE A CABBAGE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE SLEEVES AND A LARGE BLACK SCOOP SHOVEL BONNET WITH
A BLACK VEIL AND WHITE SLIM ANKLES CROSSED ABOUT WITH BLACK TAPE AND
VERY WEE BLACK SLIPPERS LIKE A CHISEL AND SHE WAS LEANING PENSIVE ON A
TOMBSTONE ON HER RIGHT ELBOW UNDER A WEEPING WILLOW AND HER OTHER HAND
HANGING DOWN HER SIDE HOLDING A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF AND A RETICULE
AND UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE IT SAID SHALL I NEVER SEE THEE MORE ALAS
ANOTHER ONE WAS A YOUNG LADY WITH HER HAIR ALL COMBED UP STRAIGHT
TO THE TOP OF HER HEAD AND KNOTTED THERE IN FRONT OF A COMB LIKE A
CHAIR BACK AND SHE WAS CRYING INTO A HANDKERCHIEF AND HAD A DEAD BIRD
LAYING ON ITS BACK IN HER OTHER HAND WITH ITS HEELS UP AND UNDERNEATH
THE PICTURE IT SAID I SHALL NEVER HEAR THY SWEET CHIRRUP MORE ALAS
THERE WAS ONE WHERE A YOUNG LADY WAS AT A WINDOW LOOKING UP AT THE
MOON AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER CHEEKS AND SHE HAD AN OPEN LETTER IN
ONE HAND WITH BLACK SEALING WAX SHOWING ON ONE EDGE OF IT AND SHE WAS
MASHING A LOCKET WITH A CHAIN TO IT AGAINST HER MOUTH AND UNDERNEATH
THE PICTURE IT SAID AND ART THOU GONE YES THOU ART GONE ALAS THESE
WAS ALL NICE PICTURES I RECKON BUT I DIDN'T SOMEHOW SEEM TO TAKE
TO THEM BECAUSE IF EVER I WAS DOWN A LITTLE THEY ALWAYS GIVE ME THE
FAN TODS
EVERYBODY WAS SORRY SHE DIED BECAUSE SHE HAD LAID OUT A LOT
MORE OF THESE PICTURES TO DO AND A BODY COULD SEE BY WHAT SHE HAD DONE
WHAT THEY HAD LOST
BUT I RECKONED THAT WITH HER DISPOSITION SHE WAS
HAVING A BETTER TIME IN THE GRAVEYARD
SHE WAS AT WORK ON WHAT THEY
SAID WAS HER GREATEST PICTURE WHEN SHE TOOK SICK AND EVERY DAY AND
EVERY NIGHT IT WAS HER PRAYER TO BE ALLOWED TO LIVE TILL SHE GOT IT
DONE BUT SHE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE
IT WAS A PICTURE OF A YOUNG WOMAN
IN A LONG WHITE GOWN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF A BRIDGE ALL READY TO JUMP
OFF WITH HER HAIR ALL DOWN HER BACK AND LOOKING UP TO THE MOON WITH
THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN HER FACE AND SHE HAD TWO ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HER
BREAST AND TWO ARMS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT AND TWO MORE REACHING UP
TOWARDS THE MOON AND THE IDEA WAS TO SEE WHICH PAIR WOULD LOOK BEST
AND THEN SCRATCH OUT ALL THE OTHER ARMS BUT AS I WAS SAYING SHE DIED
BEFORE SHE GOT HER MIND MADE UP AND NOW THEY KEPT THIS PICTURE OVER THE
HEAD OF THE BED IN HER ROOM AND EVERY TIME HER BIRTHDAY COME THEY HUNG
FLOWERS ON IT
OTHER TIMES IT WAS HID WITH A LITTLE CURTAIN
THE YOUNG
WOMAN IN THE PICTURE HAD A KIND OF A NICE SWEET FACE BUT THERE WAS SO
MANY ARMS IT MADE HER LOOK TOO SPIDERY SEEMED TO ME
THIS YOUNG GIRL KEPT A SCRAP BOOK WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE AND USED TO PASTE
OBITUARIES AND ACCIDENTS AND CASES OF PATIENT SUFFERING IN IT OUT OF THE
PRESBYTERIAN OBSERVER AND WRITE POETRY AFTER THEM OUT OF HER OWN HEAD
IT WAS VERY GOOD POETRY
THIS IS WHAT SHE WROTE ABOUT A BOY BY THE NAME
OF STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS THAT FELL DOWN A WELL AND WAS DROWNDED
ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS DEC'D
AND DID YOUNG STEPHEN SICKEN AND DID YOUNG STEPHEN DIE AND DID THE
SAD HEARTS THICKEN AND DID THE MOURNERS CRY
NO SUCH WAS NOT THE FATE OF YOUNG STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS THOUGH SAD
HEARTS ROUND HIM THICKENED 'TWAS NOT FROM SICKNESS' SHOTS
NO WHOOPING COUGH DID RACK HIS FRAME NOR MEASLES DREAR WITH SPOTS
NOT THESE IMPAIRED THE SACRED NAME OF STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS
DESPISED LOVE STRUCK NOT WITH WOE THAT HEAD OF CURLY KNOTS NOR
STOMACH TROUBLES LAID HIM LOW YOUNG STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS
O NO
THEN LIST WITH TEARFUL EYE WHILST I HIS FATE DO TELL
HIS SOUL
DID FROM THIS COLD WORLD FLY BY FALLING DOWN A WELL
THEY GOT HIM OUT AND EMPTIED HIM ALAS IT WAS TOO LATE HIS SPIRIT
WAS GONE FOR TO SPORT ALOFT IN THE REALMS OF THE GOOD AND GREAT
IF EMMELINE GRANGERFORD COULD MAKE POETRY LIKE THAT BEFORE SHE WAS
FOURTEEN THERE AIN'T NO TELLING WHAT SHE COULD A DONE BY AND BY
BUCK
SAID SHE COULD RATTLE OFF POETRY LIKE NOTHING
SHE DIDN'T EVER HAVE TO
STOP TO THINK
HE SAID SHE WOULD SLAP DOWN A LINE AND IF SHE COULDN'T
FIND ANYTHING TO RHYME WITH IT WOULD JUST SCRATCH IT OUT AND SLAP DOWN
ANOTHER ONE AND GO AHEAD
SHE WARN'T PARTICULAR SHE COULD WRITE ABOUT
ANYTHING YOU CHOOSE TO GIVE HER TO WRITE ABOUT JUST SO IT WAS SADFUL
EVERY TIME A MAN DIED OR A WOMAN DIED OR A CHILD DIED SHE WOULD BE ON
HAND WITH HER TRIBUTE BEFORE HE WAS COLD
SHE CALLED THEM TRIBUTES
THE NEIGHBORS SAID IT WAS THE DOCTOR FIRST THEN EMMELINE THEN THE
UNDERTAKER THE UNDERTAKER NEVER GOT IN AHEAD OF EMMELINE BUT ONCE AND
THEN SHE HUNG FIRE ON A RHYME FOR THE DEAD PERSON'S NAME WHICH WAS
WHISTLER
SHE WARN'T EVER THE SAME AFTER THAT SHE NEVER COMPLAINED
BUT SHE KINDER PINED AWAY AND DID NOT LIVE LONG
POOR THING MANY'S THE
TIME I MADE MYSELF GO UP TO THE LITTLE ROOM THAT USED TO BE HERS AND GET
OUT HER POOR OLD SCRAP BOOK AND READ IN IT WHEN HER PICTURES HAD BEEN
AGGRAVATING ME AND I HAD SOURED ON HER A LITTLE
I LIKED ALL THAT
FAMILY DEAD ONES AND ALL AND WARN'T GOING TO LET ANYTHING COME BETWEEN
US
POOR EMMELINE MADE POETRY ABOUT ALL THE DEAD PEOPLE WHEN SHE WAS
ALIVE AND IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT THERE WARN'T NOBODY TO MAKE SOME
ABOUT HER NOW SHE WAS GONE SO I TRIED TO SWEAT OUT A VERSE OR TWO
MYSELF BUT I COULDN'T SEEM TO MAKE IT GO SOMEHOW
THEY KEPT EMMELINE'S
ROOM TRIM AND NICE AND ALL THE THINGS FIXED IN IT JUST THE WAY SHE
LIKED TO HAVE THEM WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE AND NOBODY EVER SLEPT THERE
THE OLD LADY TOOK CARE OF THE ROOM HERSELF THOUGH THERE WAS PLENTY
OF NIGGERS AND SHE SEWED THERE A GOOD DEAL AND READ HER BIBLE THERE
MOSTLY
WELL AS I WAS SAYING ABOUT THE PARLOR THERE WAS BEAUTIFUL CURTAINS ON
THE WINDOWS WHITE WITH PICTURES PAINTED ON THEM OF CASTLES WITH VINES
ALL DOWN THE WALLS AND CATTLE COMING DOWN TO DRINK
THERE WAS A LITTLE
OLD PIANO TOO THAT HAD TIN PANS IN IT I RECKON AND NOTHING WAS EVER
SO LOVELY AS TO HEAR THE YOUNG LADIES SING THE LAST LINK IS BROKEN
AND PLAY THE BATTLE OF PRAGUE ON IT
THE WALLS OF ALL THE ROOMS WAS
PLASTERED AND MOST HAD CARPETS ON THE FLOORS AND THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS
WHITEWASHED ON THE OUTSIDE
IT WAS A DOUBLE HOUSE AND THE BIG OPEN PLACE BETWIXT THEM WAS ROOFED
AND FLOORED AND SOMETIMES THE TABLE WAS SET THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
DAY AND IT WAS A COOL COMFORTABLE PLACE
NOTHING COULDN'T BE BETTER
AND WARN'T THE COOKING GOOD AND JUST BUSHELS OF IT TOO
CHAPTER XVIII
COL
GRANGERFORD WAS A GENTLEMAN YOU SEE
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN ALL
OVER AND SO WAS HIS FAMILY
HE WAS WELL BORN AS THE SAYING IS AND
THAT'S WORTH AS MUCH IN A MAN AS IT IS IN A HORSE SO THE WIDOW DOUGLAS
SAID AND NOBODY EVER DENIED THAT SHE WAS OF THE FIRST ARISTOCRACY
IN OUR TOWN AND PAP HE ALWAYS SAID IT TOO THOUGH HE WARN'T NO MORE
QUALITY THAN A MUDCAT HIMSELF
COL
GRANGERFORD WAS VERY TALL AND
VERY SLIM AND HAD A DARKISH PALY COMPLEXION NOT A SIGN OF RED IN IT
ANYWHERES HE WAS CLEAN SHAVED EVERY MORNING ALL OVER HIS THIN FACE AND
HE HAD THE THINNEST KIND OF LIPS AND THE THINNEST KIND OF NOSTRILS AND
A HIGH NOSE AND HEAVY EYEBROWS AND THE BLACKEST KIND OF EYES SUNK SO
DEEP BACK THAT THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY WAS LOOKING OUT OF CAVERNS AT
YOU AS YOU MAY SAY
HIS FOREHEAD WAS HIGH AND HIS HAIR WAS BLACK AND
STRAIGHT AND HUNG TO HIS SHOULDERS
HIS HANDS WAS LONG AND THIN AND
EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE HE PUT ON A CLEAN SHIRT AND A FULL SUIT FROM HEAD
TO FOOT MADE OUT OF LINEN SO WHITE IT HURT YOUR EYES TO LOOK AT IT
AND ON SUNDAYS HE WORE A BLUE TAIL COAT WITH BRASS BUTTONS ON IT
HE
CARRIED A MAHOGANY CANE WITH A SILVER HEAD TO IT
THERE WARN'T NO
FRIVOLISHNESS ABOUT HIM NOT A BIT AND HE WARN'T EVER LOUD
HE WAS
AS KIND AS HE COULD BE YOU COULD FEEL THAT YOU KNOW AND SO YOU HAD
CONFIDENCE
SOMETIMES HE SMILED AND IT WAS GOOD TO SEE BUT WHEN HE
STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP LIKE A LIBERTY POLE AND THE LIGHTNING BEGUN TO
FLICKER OUT FROM UNDER HIS EYEBROWS YOU WANTED TO CLIMB A TREE FIRST
AND FIND OUT WHAT THE MATTER WAS AFTERWARDS
HE DIDN'T EVER HAVE TO
TELL ANYBODY TO MIND THEIR MANNERS EVERYBODY WAS ALWAYS GOOD MANNERED
WHERE HE WAS
EVERYBODY LOVED TO HAVE HIM AROUND TOO HE WAS SUNSHINE
MOST ALWAYS I MEAN HE MADE IT SEEM LIKE GOOD WEATHER
WHEN HE TURNED
INTO A CLOUDBANK IT WAS AWFUL DARK FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THAT WAS
ENOUGH THERE WOULDN'T NOTHING GO WRONG AGAIN FOR A WEEK
WHEN HIM AND THE OLD LADY COME DOWN IN THE MORNING ALL THE FAMILY GOT
UP OUT OF THEIR CHAIRS AND GIVE THEM GOOD DAY AND DIDN'T SET DOWN AGAIN
TILL THEY HAD SET DOWN
THEN TOM AND BOB WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD WHERE
THE DECANTER WAS AND MIXED A GLASS OF BITTERS AND HANDED IT TO HIM AND
HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND AND WAITED TILL TOM'S AND BOB'S WAS MIXED AND
THEN THEY BOWED AND SAID OUR DUTY TO YOU SIR AND MADAM AND THEY
BOWED THE LEAST BIT IN THE WORLD AND SAID THANK YOU AND SO THEY DRANK
ALL THREE AND BOB AND TOM POURED A SPOONFUL OF WATER ON THE SUGAR AND
THE MITE OF WHISKY OR APPLE BRANDY IN THE BOTTOM OF THEIR TUMBLERS AND
GIVE IT TO ME AND BUCK AND WE DRANK TO THE OLD PEOPLE TOO
BOB WAS THE OLDEST AND TOM NEXT TALL BEAUTIFUL MEN WITH VERY BROAD
SHOULDERS AND BROWN FACES AND LONG BLACK HAIR AND BLACK EYES
THEY
DRESSED IN WHITE LINEN FROM HEAD TO FOOT LIKE THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND
WORE BROAD PANAMA HATS
THEN THERE WAS MISS CHARLOTTE SHE WAS TWENTY FIVE AND TALL AND PROUD
AND GRAND BUT AS GOOD AS SHE COULD BE WHEN SHE WARN'T STIRRED UP BUT
WHEN SHE WAS SHE HAD A LOOK THAT WOULD MAKE YOU WILT IN YOUR TRACKS
LIKE HER FATHER
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
SO WAS HER SISTER MISS SOPHIA BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT KIND
SHE WAS
GENTLE AND SWEET LIKE A DOVE AND SHE WAS ONLY TWENTY
EACH PERSON HAD THEIR OWN NIGGER TO WAIT ON THEM BUCK TOO
MY NIGGER
HAD A MONSTROUS EASY TIME BECAUSE I WARN'T USED TO HAVING ANYBODY DO
ANYTHING FOR ME BUT BUCK'S WAS ON THE JUMP MOST OF THE TIME
THIS WAS ALL THERE WAS OF THE FAMILY NOW BUT THERE USED TO BE
MORE THREE SONS THEY GOT KILLED AND EMMELINE THAT DIED
THE OLD GENTLEMAN OWNED A LOT OF FARMS AND OVER A HUNDRED NIGGERS
SOMETIMES A STACK OF PEOPLE WOULD COME THERE HORSEBACK FROM TEN OR
FIFTEEN MILE AROUND AND STAY FIVE OR SIX DAYS AND HAVE SUCH JUNKETINGS
ROUND ABOUT AND ON THE RIVER AND DANCES AND PICNICS IN THE WOODS
DAYTIMES AND BALLS AT THE HOUSE NIGHTS
THESE PEOPLE WAS MOSTLY
KINFOLKS OF THE FAMILY
THE MEN BROUGHT THEIR GUNS WITH THEM
IT WAS A
HANDSOME LOT OF QUALITY I TELL YOU
THERE WAS ANOTHER CLAN OF ARISTOCRACY AROUND THERE FIVE OR SIX
FAMILIES MOSTLY OF THE NAME OF SHEPHERDSON
THEY WAS AS HIGH TONED
AND WELL BORN AND RICH AND GRAND AS THE TRIBE OF GRANGERFORDS
THE
SHEPHERDSONS AND GRANGERFORDS USED THE SAME STEAMBOAT LANDING WHICH WAS
ABOUT TWO MILE ABOVE OUR HOUSE SO SOMETIMES WHEN I WENT UP THERE WITH A
LOT OF OUR FOLKS I USED TO SEE A LOT OF THE SHEPHERDSONS THERE ON THEIR
FINE HORSES
ONE DAY BUCK AND ME WAS AWAY OUT IN THE WOODS HUNTING AND HEARD A HORSE
COMING
WE WAS CROSSING THE ROAD
BUCK SAYS
QUICK JUMP FOR THE WOODS
WE DONE IT AND THEN PEEPED DOWN THE WOODS THROUGH THE LEAVES
PRETTY
SOON A SPLENDID YOUNG MAN COME GALLOPING DOWN THE ROAD SETTING HIS
HORSE EASY AND LOOKING LIKE A SOLDIER
HE HAD HIS GUN ACROSS HIS
POMMEL
I HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE
IT WAS YOUNG HARNEY SHEPHERDSON
I
HEARD BUCK'S GUN GO OFF AT MY EAR AND HARNEY'S HAT TUMBLED OFF FROM HIS
HEAD
HE GRABBED HIS GUN AND RODE STRAIGHT TO THE PLACE WHERE WE WAS
HID
BUT WE DIDN'T WAIT
WE STARTED THROUGH THE WOODS ON A RUN
THE
WOODS WARN'T THICK SO I LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO DODGE THE BULLET
AND TWICE I SEEN HARNEY COVER BUCK WITH HIS GUN AND THEN HE RODE AWAY
THE WAY HE COME TO GET HIS HAT I RECKON BUT I COULDN'T SEE
WE NEVER
STOPPED RUNNING TILL WE GOT HOME
THE OLD GENTLEMAN'S EYES BLAZED A
MINUTE 'TWAS PLEASURE MAINLY I JUDGED THEN HIS FACE SORT OF SMOOTHED
DOWN AND HE SAYS KIND OF GENTLE
I DON'T LIKE THAT SHOOTING FROM BEHIND A BUSH
WHY DIDN'T YOU STEP
INTO THE ROAD MY BOY
THE SHEPHERDSONS DON'T FATHER
THEY ALWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE
MISS CHARLOTTE SHE HELD HER HEAD UP LIKE A QUEEN WHILE BUCK WAS TELLING
HIS TALE AND HER NOSTRILS SPREAD AND HER EYES SNAPPED
THE TWO YOUNG
MEN LOOKED DARK BUT NEVER SAID NOTHING
MISS SOPHIA SHE TURNED PALE
BUT THE COLOR COME BACK WHEN SHE FOUND THE MAN WARN'T HURT
SOON AS I COULD GET BUCK DOWN BY THE CORN CRIBS UNDER THE TREES BY
OURSELVES I SAYS
DID YOU WANT TO KILL HIM BUCK
WELL I BET I DID
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU
HIM HE NEVER DONE NOTHING TO ME
WELL THEN WHAT DID YOU WANT TO KILL HIM FOR
WHY NOTHING ONLY IT'S ON ACCOUNT OF THE FEUD
WHAT'S A FEUD
WHY WHERE WAS YOU RAISED DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT A FEUD IS
NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE TELL ME ABOUT IT
WELL SAYS BUCK A FEUD IS THIS WAY A MAN HAS A QUARREL WITH
ANOTHER MAN AND KILLS HIM THEN THAT OTHER MAN'S BROTHER KILLS HIM
THEN THE OTHER BROTHERS ON BOTH SIDES GOES FOR ONE ANOTHER THEN THE
COUSINS CHIP IN AND BY AND BY EVERYBODY'S KILLED OFF AND THERE AIN'T
NO MORE FEUD
BUT IT'S KIND OF SLOW AND TAKES A LONG TIME
HAS THIS ONE BEEN GOING ON LONG BUCK
WELL I SHOULD RECKON IT STARTED THIRTY YEAR AGO OR SOM'ERS ALONG
THERE
THERE WAS TROUBLE 'BOUT SOMETHING AND THEN A LAWSUIT TO SETTLE
IT AND THE SUIT WENT AGIN ONE OF THE MEN AND SO HE UP AND SHOT THE
MAN THAT WON THE SUIT WHICH HE WOULD NATURALLY DO OF COURSE
ANYBODY
WOULD
WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE ABOUT BUCK LAND
I RECKON MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
WELL WHO DONE THE SHOOTING WAS IT A GRANGERFORD OR A SHEPHERDSON
LAWS HOW DO I KNOW IT WAS SO LONG AGO
DON'T ANYBODY KNOW
OH YES PA KNOWS I RECKON AND SOME OF THE OTHER OLD PEOPLE BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW NOW WHAT THE ROW WAS ABOUT IN THE FIRST PLACE
HAS THERE BEEN MANY KILLED BUCK
YES RIGHT SMART CHANCE OF FUNERALS
BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS KILL
PA'S
GOT A FEW BUCKSHOT IN HIM BUT HE DON'T MIND IT 'CUZ HE DON'T WEIGH
MUCH ANYWAY
BOB'S BEEN CARVED UP SOME WITH A BOWIE AND TOM'S BEEN
HURT ONCE OR TWICE
HAS ANYBODY BEEN KILLED THIS YEAR BUCK
YES WE GOT ONE AND THEY GOT ONE
'BOUT THREE MONTHS AGO MY COUSIN
BUD FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WAS RIDING THROUGH THE WOODS ON T'OTHER SIDE
OF THE RIVER AND DIDN'T HAVE NO WEAPON WITH HIM WHICH WAS BLAME'
FOOLISHNESS AND IN A LONESOME PLACE HE HEARS A HORSE A COMING BEHIND
HIM AND SEES OLD BALDY SHEPHERDSON A LINKIN' AFTER HIM WITH HIS GUN IN
HIS HAND AND HIS WHITE HAIR A FLYING IN THE WIND AND 'STEAD OF JUMPING
OFF AND TAKING TO THE BRUSH BUD 'LOWED HE COULD OUT RUN HIM SO THEY
HAD IT NIP AND TUCK FOR FIVE MILE OR MORE THE OLD MAN A GAINING ALL
THE TIME SO AT LAST BUD SEEN IT WARN'T ANY USE SO HE STOPPED AND FACED
AROUND SO AS TO HAVE THE BULLET HOLES IN FRONT YOU KNOW AND THE OLD
MAN HE RODE UP AND SHOT HIM DOWN
BUT HE DIDN'T GIT MUCH CHANCE TO
ENJOY HIS LUCK FOR INSIDE OF A WEEK OUR FOLKS LAID HIM OUT
I RECKON THAT OLD MAN WAS A COWARD BUCK
I RECKON HE WARN'T A COWARD
NOT BY A BLAME' SIGHT
THERE AIN'T A
COWARD AMONGST THEM SHEPHERDSONS NOT A ONE
AND THERE AIN'T NO COWARDS
AMONGST THE GRANGERFORDS EITHER
WHY THAT OLD MAN KEP' UP HIS END IN A
FIGHT ONE DAY FOR HALF AN HOUR AGAINST THREE GRANGERFORDS AND COME
OUT WINNER
THEY WAS ALL A HORSEBACK HE LIT OFF OF HIS HORSE AND GOT
BEHIND A LITTLE WOODPILE AND KEP' HIS HORSE BEFORE HIM TO STOP THE
BULLETS BUT THE GRANGERFORDS STAYED ON THEIR HORSES AND CAPERED AROUND
THE OLD MAN AND PEPPERED AWAY AT HIM AND HE PEPPERED AWAY AT THEM
HIM AND HIS HORSE BOTH WENT HOME PRETTY LEAKY AND CRIPPLED BUT THE
GRANGERFORDS HAD TO BE FETCHED HOME AND ONE OF 'EM WAS DEAD AND
ANOTHER DIED THE NEXT DAY
NO SIR IF A BODY'S OUT HUNTING FOR COWARDS
HE DON'T WANT TO FOOL AWAY ANY TIME AMONGST THEM SHEPHERDSONS BECUZ
THEY DON'T BREED ANY OF THAT KIND
NEXT SUNDAY WE ALL WENT TO CHURCH ABOUT THREE MILE EVERYBODY
A HORSEBACK
THE MEN TOOK THEIR GUNS ALONG SO DID BUCK AND KEPT
THEM BETWEEN THEIR KNEES OR STOOD THEM HANDY AGAINST THE WALL
THE
SHEPHERDSONS DONE THE SAME
IT WAS PRETTY ORNERY PREACHING ALL ABOUT
BROTHERLY LOVE AND SUCH LIKE TIRESOMENESS BUT EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS
A GOOD SERMON AND THEY ALL TALKED IT OVER GOING HOME AND HAD SUCH
A POWERFUL LOT TO SAY ABOUT FAITH AND GOOD WORKS AND FREE GRACE AND
PREFOREORDESTINATION AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THAT IT DID SEEM TO ME
TO BE ONE OF THE ROUGHEST SUNDAYS I HAD RUN ACROSS YET
ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER DINNER EVERYBODY WAS DOZING AROUND SOME IN THEIR
CHAIRS AND SOME IN THEIR ROOMS AND IT GOT TO BE PRETTY DULL
BUCK AND
A DOG WAS STRETCHED OUT ON THE GRASS IN THE SUN SOUND ASLEEP
I WENT UP
TO OUR ROOM AND JUDGED I WOULD TAKE A NAP MYSELF
I FOUND THAT SWEET
MISS SOPHIA STANDING IN HER DOOR WHICH WAS NEXT TO OURS AND SHE TOOK
ME IN HER ROOM AND SHUT THE DOOR VERY SOFT AND ASKED ME IF I LIKED HER
AND I SAID I DID AND SHE ASKED ME IF I WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND
NOT TELL ANYBODY AND I SAID I WOULD
THEN SHE SAID SHE'D FORGOT HER
TESTAMENT AND LEFT IT IN THE SEAT AT CHURCH BETWEEN TWO OTHER BOOKS
AND WOULD I SLIP OUT QUIET AND GO THERE AND FETCH IT TO HER AND NOT SAY
NOTHING TO NOBODY
I SAID I WOULD
SO I SLID OUT AND SLIPPED OFF UP THE
ROAD AND THERE WARN'T ANYBODY AT THE CHURCH EXCEPT MAYBE A HOG OR TWO
FOR THERE WARN'T ANY LOCK ON THE DOOR AND HOGS LIKES A PUNCHEON FLOOR
IN SUMMER TIME BECAUSE IT'S COOL
IF YOU NOTICE MOST FOLKS DON'T GO TO
CHURCH ONLY WHEN THEY'VE GOT TO BUT A HOG IS DIFFERENT
SAYS I TO MYSELF SOMETHING'S UP IT AIN'T NATURAL FOR A GIRL TO BE IN
SUCH A SWEAT ABOUT A TESTAMENT
SO I GIVE IT A SHAKE AND OUT DROPS A
LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER WITH HALF PAST TWO WROTE ON IT WITH A PENCIL
I
RANSACKED IT BUT COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING ELSE
I COULDN'T MAKE ANYTHING
OUT OF THAT SO I PUT THE PAPER IN THE BOOK AGAIN AND WHEN I GOT HOME
AND UPSTAIRS THERE WAS MISS SOPHIA IN HER DOOR WAITING FOR ME
SHE
PULLED ME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR THEN SHE LOOKED IN THE TESTAMENT TILL
SHE FOUND THE PAPER AND AS SOON AS SHE READ IT SHE LOOKED GLAD AND
BEFORE A BODY COULD THINK SHE GRABBED ME AND GIVE ME A SQUEEZE AND
SAID I WAS THE BEST BOY IN THE WORLD AND NOT TO TELL ANYBODY
SHE WAS
MIGHTY RED IN THE FACE FOR A MINUTE AND HER EYES LIGHTED UP AND IT
MADE HER POWERFUL PRETTY
I WAS A GOOD DEAL ASTONISHED BUT WHEN I GOT
MY BREATH I ASKED HER WHAT THE PAPER WAS ABOUT AND SHE ASKED ME IF I
HAD READ IT AND I SAID NO AND SHE ASKED ME IF I COULD READ WRITING
AND I TOLD HER NO ONLY COARSE HAND AND THEN SHE SAID THE PAPER
WARN'T ANYTHING BUT A BOOK MARK TO KEEP HER PLACE AND I MIGHT GO AND
PLAY NOW
I WENT OFF DOWN TO THE RIVER STUDYING OVER THIS THING AND PRETTY SOON
I NOTICED THAT MY NIGGER WAS FOLLOWING ALONG BEHIND
WHEN WE WAS OUT
OF SIGHT OF THE HOUSE HE LOOKED BACK AND AROUND A SECOND AND THEN COMES
A RUNNING AND SAYS
MARS JAWGE IF YOU'LL COME DOWN INTO DE SWAMP I'LL SHOW YOU A WHOLE
STACK O' WATER MOCCASINS
THINKS I THAT'S MIGHTY CURIOUS HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY
HE OUGHTER
KNOW A BODY DON'T LOVE WATER MOCCASINS ENOUGH TO GO AROUND HUNTING FOR
THEM
WHAT IS HE UP TO ANYWAY SO I SAYS
ALL RIGHT TROT AHEAD
I FOLLOWED A HALF A MILE THEN HE STRUCK OUT OVER THE SWAMP AND WADED
ANKLE DEEP AS MUCH AS ANOTHER HALF MILE
WE COME TO A LITTLE FLAT PIECE
OF LAND WHICH WAS DRY AND VERY THICK WITH TREES AND BUSHES AND VINES
AND HE SAYS

I TOOK UP THE RIVER ROAD AS HARD AS I COULD PUT
BY AND BY I BEGIN TO
HEAR GUNS A GOOD WAYS OFF
WHEN I COME IN SIGHT OF THE LOG STORE AND
THE WOODPILE WHERE THE STEAMBOATS LANDS I WORKED ALONG UNDER THE TREES
AND BRUSH TILL I GOT TO A GOOD PLACE AND THEN I CLUMB UP INTO THE
FORKS OF A COTTONWOOD THAT WAS OUT OF REACH AND WATCHED
THERE WAS A
WOOD RANK FOUR FOOT HIGH A LITTLE WAYS IN FRONT OF THE TREE AND FIRST I
WAS GOING TO HIDE BEHIND THAT BUT MAYBE IT WAS LUCKIER I DIDN'T
THERE WAS FOUR OR FIVE MEN CAVORTING AROUND ON THEIR HORSES IN THE OPEN
PLACE BEFORE THE LOG STORE CUSSING AND YELLING AND TRYING TO GET AT
A COUPLE OF YOUNG CHAPS THAT WAS BEHIND THE WOOD RANK ALONGSIDE OF THE
STEAMBOAT LANDING BUT THEY COULDN'T COME IT
EVERY TIME ONE OF THEM
SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE RIVER SIDE OF THE WOODPILE HE GOT SHOT AT
THE
TWO BOYS WAS SQUATTING BACK TO BACK BEHIND THE PILE SO THEY COULD WATCH
BOTH WAYS
BY AND BY THE MEN STOPPED CAVORTING AROUND AND YELLING
THEY STARTED
RIDING TOWARDS THE STORE THEN UP GETS ONE OF THE BOYS DRAWS A STEADY
BEAD OVER THE WOOD RANK AND DROPS ONE OF THEM OUT OF HIS SADDLE
ALL
THE MEN JUMPED OFF OF THEIR HORSES AND GRABBED THE HURT ONE AND STARTED
TO CARRY HIM TO THE STORE AND THAT MINUTE THE TWO BOYS STARTED ON THE
RUN
THEY GOT HALF WAY TO THE TREE I WAS IN BEFORE THE MEN NOTICED
THEN THE MEN SEE THEM AND JUMPED ON THEIR HORSES AND TOOK OUT AFTER
THEM
THEY GAINED ON THE BOYS BUT IT DIDN'T DO NO GOOD THE BOYS HAD
TOO GOOD A START THEY GOT TO THE WOODPILE THAT WAS IN FRONT OF MY TREE
AND SLIPPED IN BEHIND IT AND SO THEY HAD THE BULGE ON THE MEN AGAIN
ONE OF THE BOYS WAS BUCK AND THE OTHER WAS A SLIM YOUNG CHAP ABOUT
NINETEEN YEARS OLD
THE MEN RIPPED AROUND AWHILE AND THEN RODE AWAY
AS SOON AS THEY WAS
OUT OF SIGHT I SUNG OUT TO BUCK AND TOLD HIM
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO MAKE OF MY VOICE COMING OUT OF THE TREE AT FIRST
HE WAS AWFUL
SURPRISED
HE TOLD ME TO WATCH OUT SHARP AND LET HIM KNOW WHEN THE
MEN COME IN SIGHT AGAIN SAID THEY WAS UP TO SOME DEVILMENT OR
OTHER WOULDN'T BE GONE LONG
I WISHED I WAS OUT OF THAT TREE BUT I
DASN'T COME DOWN
BUCK BEGUN TO CRY AND RIP AND 'LOWED THAT HIM AND
HIS COUSIN JOE THAT WAS THE OTHER YOUNG CHAP WOULD MAKE UP FOR THIS
DAY YET
HE SAID HIS FATHER AND HIS TWO BROTHERS WAS KILLED AND TWO
OR THREE OF THE ENEMY
SAID THE SHEPHERDSONS LAID FOR THEM IN
AMBUSH
BUCK SAID HIS FATHER AND BROTHERS OUGHT TO WAITED FOR THEIR
RELATIONS THE SHEPHERDSONS WAS TOO STRONG FOR THEM
I ASKED HIM WHAT
WAS BECOME OF YOUNG HARNEY AND MISS SOPHIA
HE SAID THEY'D GOT ACROSS
THE RIVER AND WAS SAFE
I WAS GLAD OF THAT BUT THE WAY BUCK DID TAKE
ON BECAUSE HE DIDN'T MANAGE TO KILL HARNEY THAT DAY HE SHOT AT HIM I
HAIN'T EVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE IT
ALL OF A SUDDEN BANG BANG BANG GOES THREE OR FOUR GUNS THE MEN HAD
SLIPPED AROUND THROUGH THE WOODS AND COME IN FROM BEHIND WITHOUT THEIR
HORSES THE BOYS JUMPED FOR THE RIVER BOTH OF THEM HURT AND AS THEY
SWUM DOWN THE CURRENT THE MEN RUN ALONG THE BANK SHOOTING AT THEM AND
SINGING OUT KILL THEM KILL THEM IT MADE ME SO SICK I MOST FELL OUT
OF THE TREE
I AIN'T A GOING TO TELL ALL THAT HAPPENED IT WOULD MAKE
ME SICK AGAIN IF I WAS TO DO THAT
I WISHED I HADN'T EVER COME ASHORE
THAT NIGHT TO SEE SUCH THINGS
I AIN'T EVER GOING TO GET SHUT OF
THEM LOTS OF TIMES I DREAM ABOUT THEM
I STAYED IN THE TREE TILL IT BEGUN TO GET DARK AFRAID TO COME DOWN
SOMETIMES I HEARD GUNS AWAY OFF IN THE WOODS AND TWICE I SEEN LITTLE
GANGS OF MEN GALLOP PAST THE LOG STORE WITH GUNS SO I RECKONED THE
TROUBLE WAS STILL A GOING ON
I WAS MIGHTY DOWNHEARTED SO I MADE UP MY
MIND I WOULDN'T EVER GO ANEAR THAT HOUSE AGAIN BECAUSE I RECKONED I
WAS TO BLAME SOMEHOW
I JUDGED THAT THAT PIECE OF PAPER MEANT THAT MISS
SOPHIA WAS TO MEET HARNEY SOMEWHERES AT HALF PAST TWO AND RUN OFF AND
I JUDGED I OUGHT TO TOLD HER FATHER ABOUT THAT PAPER AND THE CURIOUS WAY
SHE ACTED AND THEN MAYBE HE WOULD A LOCKED HER UP AND THIS AWFUL MESS
WOULDN'T EVER HAPPENED
WHEN I GOT DOWN OUT OF THE TREE I CREPT ALONG DOWN THE RIVER BANK A
PIECE AND FOUND THE TWO BODIES LAYING IN THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND
TUGGED AT THEM TILL I GOT THEM ASHORE THEN I COVERED UP THEIR FACES
AND GOT AWAY AS QUICK AS I COULD
I CRIED A LITTLE WHEN I WAS COVERING
UP BUCK'S FACE FOR HE WAS MIGHTY GOOD TO ME
IT WAS JUST DARK NOW
I NEVER WENT NEAR THE HOUSE BUT STRUCK THROUGH
THE WOODS AND MADE FOR THE SWAMP
JIM WARN'T ON HIS ISLAND SO I
TRAMPED OFF IN A HURRY FOR THE CRICK AND CROWDED THROUGH THE WILLOWS
RED HOT TO JUMP ABOARD AND GET OUT OF THAT AWFUL COUNTRY
THE RAFT WAS
GONE MY SOULS BUT I WAS SCARED I COULDN'T GET MY BREATH FOR MOST
A MINUTE
THEN I RAISED A YELL
A VOICE NOT TWENTY FIVE FOOT FROM ME
SAYS
GOOD LAN' IS DAT YOU HONEY DOAN' MAKE NO NOISE
IT WAS JIM'S VOICE NOTHING EVER SOUNDED SO GOOD BEFORE
I RUN ALONG THE
BANK A PIECE AND GOT ABOARD AND JIM HE GRABBED ME AND HUGGED ME HE WAS

THAT 'LL HELP THEM THINK SO SO DON'T YOU LOSE NO TIME JIM BUT JUST
SHOVE OFF FOR THE BIG WATER AS FAST AS EVER YOU CAN
I NEVER FELT EASY TILL THE RAFT WAS TWO MILE BELOW THERE AND OUT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE MISSISSIPPI
THEN WE HUNG UP OUR SIGNAL LANTERN AND
JUDGED THAT WE WAS FREE AND SAFE ONCE MORE
I HADN'T HAD A BITE TO EAT
SINCE YESTERDAY SO JIM HE GOT OUT SOME CORN DODGERS AND BUTTERMILK
AND PORK AND CABBAGE AND GREENS THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO GOOD
WHEN IT'S COOKED RIGHT AND WHILST I EAT MY SUPPER WE TALKED AND HAD A
GOOD TIME
I WAS POWERFUL GLAD TO GET AWAY FROM THE FEUDS AND SO WAS
JIM TO GET AWAY FROM THE SWAMP
WE SAID THERE WARN'T NO HOME LIKE A
RAFT AFTER ALL
OTHER PLACES DO SEEM SO CRAMPED UP AND SMOTHERY BUT A
RAFT DON'T
YOU FEEL MIGHTY FREE AND EASY AND COMFORTABLE ON A RAFT
CHAPTER XIX
TWO OR THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS WENT BY I RECKON I MIGHT SAY THEY SWUM BY
THEY SLID ALONG SO QUIET AND SMOOTH AND LOVELY
HERE IS THE WAY WE PUT
IN THE TIME
IT WAS A MONSTROUS BIG RIVER DOWN THERE SOMETIMES A MILE
AND A HALF WIDE WE RUN NIGHTS AND LAID UP AND HID DAYTIMES SOON AS
NIGHT WAS MOST GONE WE STOPPED NAVIGATING AND TIED UP NEARLY ALWAYS
IN THE DEAD WATER UNDER A TOWHEAD AND THEN CUT YOUNG COTTONWOODS AND
WILLOWS AND HID THE RAFT WITH THEM
THEN WE SET OUT THE LINES
NEXT
WE SLID INTO THE RIVER AND HAD A SWIM SO AS TO FRESHEN UP AND COOL
OFF THEN WE SET DOWN ON THE SANDY BOTTOM WHERE THE WATER WAS ABOUT KNEE
DEEP AND WATCHED THE DAYLIGHT COME
NOT A SOUND ANYWHERES PERFECTLY
STILL JUST LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD WAS ASLEEP ONLY SOMETIMES THE BULLFROGS
A CLUTTERING MAYBE
THE FIRST THING TO SEE LOOKING AWAY OVER THE
WATER WAS A KIND OF DULL LINE THAT WAS THE WOODS ON T'OTHER SIDE YOU
COULDN'T MAKE NOTHING ELSE OUT THEN A PALE PLACE IN THE SKY THEN MORE
PALENESS SPREADING AROUND THEN THE RIVER SOFTENED UP AWAY OFF AND
WARN'T BLACK ANY MORE BUT GRAY YOU COULD SEE LITTLE DARK SPOTS
DRIFTING ALONG EVER SO FAR AWAY TRADING SCOWS AND SUCH THINGS AND
LONG BLACK STREAKS RAFTS SOMETIMES YOU COULD HEAR A SWEEP SCREAKING OR
JUMBLED UP VOICES IT WAS SO STILL AND SOUNDS COME SO FAR AND BY AND
BY YOU COULD SEE A STREAK ON THE WATER WHICH YOU KNOW BY THE LOOK OF THE
STREAK THAT THERE'S A SNAG THERE IN A SWIFT CURRENT WHICH BREAKS ON IT
AND MAKES THAT STREAK LOOK THAT WAY AND YOU SEE THE MIST CURL UP OFF
OF THE WATER AND THE EAST REDDENS UP AND THE RIVER AND YOU MAKE OUT A
LOG CABIN IN THE EDGE OF THE WOODS AWAY ON THE BANK ON T'OTHER SIDE OF
THE RIVER BEING A WOODYARD LIKELY AND PILED BY THEM CHEATS SO YOU CAN
THROW A DOG THROUGH IT ANYWHERES THEN THE NICE BREEZE SPRINGS UP AND
COMES FANNING YOU FROM OVER THERE SO COOL AND FRESH AND SWEET TO SMELL
ON ACCOUNT OF THE WOODS AND THE FLOWERS BUT SOMETIMES NOT THAT WAY
BECAUSE THEY'VE LEFT DEAD FISH LAYING AROUND GARS AND SUCH AND THEY
DO GET PRETTY RANK AND NEXT YOU'VE GOT THE FULL DAY AND EVERYTHING
SMILING IN THE SUN AND THE SONG BIRDS JUST GOING IT
A LITTLE SMOKE COULDN'T BE NOTICED NOW SO WE WOULD TAKE SOME FISH OFF
OF THE LINES AND COOK UP A HOT BREAKFAST
AND AFTERWARDS WE WOULD WATCH
THE LONESOMENESS OF THE RIVER AND KIND OF LAZY ALONG AND BY AND BY
LAZY OFF TO SLEEP
WAKE UP BY AND BY AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT DONE IT AND
MAYBE SEE A STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG UP STREAM SO FAR OFF TOWARDS THE
OTHER SIDE YOU COULDN'T TELL NOTHING ABOUT HER ONLY WHETHER SHE WAS
A STERN WHEEL OR SIDE WHEEL THEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THERE WOULDN'T BE
NOTHING TO HEAR NOR NOTHING TO SEE JUST SOLID LONESOMENESS
NEXT
YOU'D SEE A RAFT SLIDING BY AWAY OFF YONDER AND MAYBE A GALOOT ON IT
CHOPPING BECAUSE THEY'RE MOST ALWAYS DOING IT ON A RAFT YOU'D SEE THE
AXE FLASH AND COME DOWN YOU DON'T HEAR NOTHING YOU SEE THAT AXE GO
UP AGAIN AND BY THE TIME IT'S ABOVE THE MAN'S HEAD THEN YOU HEAR THE
K'CHUNK IT HAD TOOK ALL THAT TIME TO COME OVER THE WATER
SO WE
WOULD PUT IN THE DAY LAZYING AROUND LISTENING TO THE STILLNESS
ONCE
THERE WAS A THICK FOG AND THE RAFTS AND THINGS THAT WENT BY WAS BEATING
TIN PANS SO THE STEAMBOATS WOULDN'T RUN OVER THEM
A SCOW OR A
RAFT WENT BY SO CLOSE WE COULD HEAR THEM TALKING AND CUSSING AND
LAUGHING HEARD THEM PLAIN BUT WE COULDN'T SEE NO SIGN OF THEM IT MADE
YOU FEEL CRAWLY IT WAS LIKE SPIRITS CARRYING ON THAT WAY IN THE AIR
JIM SAID HE BELIEVED IT WAS SPIRITS BUT I SAYS
NO SPIRITS WOULDN'T SAY 'DERN THE DERN FOG
SOON AS IT WAS NIGHT OUT WE SHOVED WHEN WE GOT HER OUT TO ABOUT THE
MIDDLE WE LET HER ALONE AND LET HER FLOAT WHEREVER THE CURRENT WANTED
HER TO THEN WE LIT THE PIPES AND DANGLED OUR LEGS IN THE WATER AND
TALKED ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS WE WAS ALWAYS NAKED DAY AND NIGHT
WHENEVER THE MOSQUITOES WOULD LET US THE NEW CLOTHES BUCK'S FOLKS MADE
FOR ME WAS TOO GOOD TO BE COMFORTABLE AND BESIDES I DIDN'T GO MUCH ON
CLOTHES NOHOW
SOMETIMES WE'D HAVE THAT WHOLE RIVER ALL TO OURSELVES FOR THE LONGEST
TIME
YONDER WAS THE BANKS AND THE ISLANDS ACROSS THE WATER AND MAYBE
A SPARK WHICH WAS A CANDLE IN A CABIN WINDOW AND SOMETIMES ON THE WATER
YOU COULD SEE A SPARK OR TWO ON A RAFT OR A SCOW YOU KNOW AND MAYBE
YOU COULD HEAR A FIDDLE OR A SONG COMING OVER FROM ONE OF THEM CRAFTS
IT'S LOVELY TO LIVE ON A RAFT
WE HAD THE SKY UP THERE ALL SPECKLED
WITH STARS AND WE USED TO LAY ON OUR BACKS AND LOOK UP AT THEM AND
DISCUSS ABOUT WHETHER THEY WAS MADE OR ONLY JUST HAPPENED
JIM HE
ALLOWED THEY WAS MADE BUT I ALLOWED THEY HAPPENED I JUDGED IT WOULD
HAVE TOOK TOO LONG TO MAKE SO MANY
JIM SAID THE MOON COULD A LAID
THEM WELL THAT LOOKED KIND OF REASONABLE SO I DIDN'T SAY NOTHING
AGAINST IT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN A FROG LAY MOST AS MANY SO OF COURSE IT
COULD BE DONE
WE USED TO WATCH THE STARS THAT FELL TOO AND SEE THEM
STREAK DOWN
JIM ALLOWED THEY'D GOT SPOILED AND WAS HOVE OUT OF THE
NEST
ONCE OR TWICE OF A NIGHT WE WOULD SEE A STEAMBOAT SLIPPING ALONG IN THE
DARK AND NOW AND THEN SHE WOULD BELCH A WHOLE WORLD OF SPARKS UP OUT
OF HER CHIMBLEYS AND THEY WOULD RAIN DOWN IN THE RIVER AND LOOK AWFUL
PRETTY THEN SHE WOULD TURN A CORNER AND HER LIGHTS WOULD WINK OUT AND
HER POWWOW SHUT OFF AND LEAVE THE RIVER STILL AGAIN AND BY AND BY HER
WAVES WOULD GET TO US A LONG TIME AFTER SHE WAS GONE AND JOGGLE THE
RAFT A BIT AND AFTER THAT YOU WOULDN'T HEAR NOTHING FOR YOU COULDN'T
TELL HOW LONG EXCEPT MAYBE FROGS OR SOMETHING
AFTER MIDNIGHT THE PEOPLE ON SHORE WENT TO BED AND THEN FOR TWO OR
THREE HOURS THE SHORES WAS BLACK NO MORE SPARKS IN THE CABIN WINDOWS
THESE SPARKS WAS OUR CLOCK THE FIRST ONE THAT SHOWED AGAIN MEANT
MORNING WAS COMING SO WE HUNTED A PLACE TO HIDE AND TIE UP RIGHT AWAY
ONE MORNING ABOUT DAYBREAK I FOUND A CANOE AND CROSSED OVER A CHUTE TO
THE MAIN SHORE IT WAS ONLY TWO HUNDRED YARDS AND PADDLED ABOUT A MILE
UP A CRICK AMONGST THE CYPRESS WOODS TO SEE IF I COULDN'T GET SOME
BERRIES
JUST AS I WAS PASSING A PLACE WHERE A KIND OF A COWPATH CROSSED
THE CRICK HERE COMES A COUPLE OF MEN TEARING UP THE PATH AS TIGHT AS
THEY COULD FOOT IT
I THOUGHT I WAS A GONER FOR WHENEVER ANYBODY WAS
AFTER ANYBODY I JUDGED IT WAS ME OR MAYBE JIM
I WAS ABOUT TO DIG OUT
FROM THERE IN A HURRY BUT THEY WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO ME THEN AND SUNG
OUT AND BEGGED ME TO SAVE THEIR LIVES SAID THEY HADN'T BEEN DOING
NOTHING AND WAS BEING CHASED FOR IT SAID THERE WAS MEN AND DOGS
A COMING
THEY WANTED TO JUMP RIGHT IN BUT I SAYS
DON'T YOU DO IT
I DON'T HEAR THE DOGS AND HORSES YET YOU'VE GOT TIME
TO CROWD THROUGH THE BRUSH AND GET UP THE CRICK A LITTLE WAYS THEN YOU
TAKE TO THE WATER AND WADE DOWN TO ME AND GET IN THAT'LL THROW THE DOGS
OFF THE SCENT
THEY DONE IT AND SOON AS THEY WAS ABOARD I LIT OUT FOR OUR TOWHEAD
AND IN ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES WE HEARD THE DOGS AND THE MEN AWAY OFF
SHOUTING
WE HEARD THEM COME ALONG TOWARDS THE CRICK BUT COULDN'T
SEE THEM THEY SEEMED TO STOP AND FOOL AROUND A WHILE THEN AS WE GOT
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY ALL THE TIME WE COULDN'T HARDLY HEAR THEM AT
ALL BY THE TIME WE HAD LEFT A MILE OF WOODS BEHIND US AND STRUCK THE
RIVER EVERYTHING WAS QUIET AND WE PADDLED OVER TO THE TOWHEAD AND HID
IN THE COTTONWOODS AND WAS SAFE
ONE OF THESE FELLOWS WAS ABOUT SEVENTY OR UPWARDS AND HAD A BALD HEAD
AND VERY GRAY WHISKERS
HE HAD AN OLD BATTERED UP SLOUCH HAT ON AND
A GREASY BLUE WOOLLEN SHIRT AND RAGGED OLD BLUE JEANS BRITCHES STUFFED
INTO HIS BOOT TOPS AND HOME KNIT GALLUSES NO HE ONLY HAD ONE
HE HAD
AN OLD LONG TAILED BLUE JEANS COAT WITH SLICK BRASS BUTTONS FLUNG OVER
HIS ARM AND BOTH OF THEM HAD BIG FAT RATTY LOOKING CARPET BAGS
THE OTHER FELLOW WAS ABOUT THIRTY AND DRESSED ABOUT AS ORNERY
AFTER
BREAKFAST WE ALL LAID OFF AND TALKED AND THE FIRST THING THAT COME OUT
WAS THAT THESE CHAPS DIDN'T KNOW ONE ANOTHER
WHAT GOT YOU INTO TROUBLE SAYS THE BALDHEAD TO T'OTHER CHAP
WELL I'D BEEN SELLING AN ARTICLE TO TAKE THE TARTAR OFF THE TEETH AND
IT DOES TAKE IT OFF TOO AND GENERLY THE ENAMEL ALONG WITH IT BUT I

JIM'S EYES BUGGED OUT WHEN HE HEARD THAT AND I RECKON MINE DID TOO
THEN THE BALDHEAD SAYS NO YOU CAN'T MEAN IT
YES
MY GREAT GRANDFATHER ELDEST SON OF THE DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER FLED
TO THIS COUNTRY ABOUT THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY TO BREATHE THE PURE
AIR OF FREEDOM MARRIED HERE AND DIED LEAVING A SON HIS OWN FATHER
DYING ABOUT THE SAME TIME
THE SECOND SON OF THE LATE DUKE SEIZED THE
TITLES AND ESTATES THE INFANT REAL DUKE WAS IGNORED
I AM THE LINEAL
DESCENDANT OF THAT INFANT I AM THE RIGHTFUL DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER AND
HERE AM I FORLORN TORN FROM MY HIGH ESTATE HUNTED OF MEN DESPISED
BY THE COLD WORLD RAGGED WORN HEART BROKEN AND DEGRADED TO THE
COMPANIONSHIP OF FELONS ON A RAFT
JIM PITIED HIM EVER SO MUCH AND SO DID I
WE TRIED TO COMFORT HIM BUT
HE SAID IT WARN'T MUCH USE HE COULDN'T BE MUCH COMFORTED SAID IF WE
WAS A MIND TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM THAT WOULD DO HIM MORE GOOD THAN MOST
ANYTHING ELSE SO WE SAID WE WOULD IF HE WOULD TELL US HOW
HE SAID WE
OUGHT TO BOW WHEN WE SPOKE TO HIM AND SAY YOUR GRACE OR MY LORD
OR YOUR LORDSHIP AND HE WOULDN'T MIND IT IF WE CALLED HIM PLAIN
BRIDGEWATER WHICH HE SAID WAS A TITLE ANYWAY AND NOT A NAME AND
ONE OF US OUGHT TO WAIT ON HIM AT DINNER AND DO ANY LITTLE THING FOR
HIM HE WANTED DONE
WELL THAT WAS ALL EASY SO WE DONE IT
ALL THROUGH DINNER JIM STOOD
AROUND AND WAITED ON HIM AND SAYS WILL YO' GRACE HAVE SOME O' DIS OR
SOME O' DAT AND SO ON AND A BODY COULD SEE IT WAS MIGHTY PLEASING TO
HIM
BUT THE OLD MAN GOT PRETTY SILENT BY AND BY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY AND
DIDN'T LOOK PRETTY COMFORTABLE OVER ALL THAT PETTING THAT WAS GOING ON
AROUND THAT DUKE
HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOMETHING ON HIS MIND
SO ALONG
IN THE AFTERNOON HE SAYS
LOOKY HERE BILGEWATER HE SAYS I'M NATION SORRY FOR YOU BUT YOU
AIN'T THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S HAD TROUBLES LIKE THAT
NO
NO YOU AIN'T
YOU AIN'T THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S BEN SNAKED DOWN
WRONGFULLY OUT'N A HIGH PLACE
ALAS
NO YOU AIN'T THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S HAD A SECRET OF HIS BIRTH AND
BY JINGS HE BEGINS TO CRY
HOLD WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BILGEWATER KIN I TRUST YOU SAYS THE OLD MAN STILL SORT OF SOBBING
TO THE BITTER DEATH HE TOOK THE OLD MAN BY THE HAND AND SQUEEZED IT
AND SAYS THAT SECRET OF YOUR BEING SPEAK
BILGEWATER I AM THE LATE DAUPHIN
YOU BET YOU JIM AND ME STARED THIS TIME
THEN THE DUKE SAYS
YOU ARE WHAT
YES MY FRIEND IT IS TOO TRUE YOUR EYES IS LOOKIN' AT THIS VERY MOMENT
ON THE PORE DISAPPEARED DAUPHIN LOOY THE SEVENTEEN SON OF LOOY THE
SIXTEEN AND MARRY ANTONETTE
YOU AT YOUR AGE NO YOU MEAN YOU'RE THE LATE CHARLEMAGNE YOU MUST
BE SIX OR SEVEN HUNDRED YEARS OLD AT THE VERY LEAST

THESE GRAY HAIRS AND THIS PREMATURE BALDITUDE
YES GENTLEMEN YOU
SEE BEFORE YOU IN BLUE JEANS AND MISERY THE WANDERIN' EXILED
TRAMPLED ON AND SUFFERIN' RIGHTFUL KING OF FRANCE
WELL HE CRIED AND TOOK ON SO THAT ME AND JIM DIDN'T KNOW HARDLY WHAT TO
DO WE WAS SO SORRY AND SO GLAD AND PROUD WE'D GOT HIM WITH US TOO
SO WE SET IN LIKE WE DONE BEFORE WITH THE DUKE AND TRIED TO COMFORT
HIM
BUT HE SAID IT WARN'T NO USE NOTHING BUT TO BE DEAD AND DONE
WITH IT ALL COULD DO HIM ANY GOOD THOUGH HE SAID IT OFTEN MADE HIM FEEL
EASIER AND BETTER FOR A WHILE IF PEOPLE TREATED HIM ACCORDING TO HIS
RIGHTS AND GOT DOWN ON ONE KNEE TO SPEAK TO HIM AND ALWAYS CALLED HIM
YOUR MAJESTY AND WAITED ON HIM FIRST AT MEALS AND DIDN'T SET DOWN
IN HIS PRESENCE TILL HE ASKED THEM
SO JIM AND ME SET TO MAJESTYING HIM
AND DOING THIS AND THAT AND T'OTHER FOR HIM AND STANDING UP TILL HE
TOLD US WE MIGHT SET DOWN
THIS DONE HIM HEAPS OF GOOD AND SO HE
GOT CHEERFUL AND COMFORTABLE
BUT THE DUKE KIND OF SOURED ON HIM AND
DIDN'T LOOK A BIT SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THINGS WAS GOING STILL
THE KING ACTED REAL FRIENDLY TOWARDS HIM AND SAID THE DUKE'S
GREAT GRANDFATHER AND ALL THE OTHER DUKES OF BILGEWATER WAS A GOOD
DEAL THOUGHT OF BY HIS FATHER AND WAS ALLOWED TO COME TO THE PALACE
CONSIDERABLE BUT THE DUKE STAYED HUFFY A GOOD WHILE TILL BY AND BY THE
KING SAYS
LIKE AS NOT WE GOT TO BE TOGETHER A BLAMED LONG TIME ON THIS H YER
RAFT BILGEWATER AND SO WHAT'S THE USE O' YOUR BEIN' SOUR IT 'LL ONLY
MAKE THINGS ONCOMFORTABLE
IT AIN'T MY FAULT I WARN'T BORN A DUKE
IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT YOU WARN'T BORN A KING SO WHAT'S THE USE TO WORRY
MAKE THE BEST O' THINGS THE WAY YOU FIND 'EM SAYS I THAT'S MY MOTTO
THIS AIN'T NO BAD THING THAT WE'VE STRUCK HERE PLENTY GRUB AND AN EASY
LIFE COME GIVE US YOUR HAND DUKE AND LE'S ALL BE FRIENDS
THE DUKE DONE IT AND JIM AND ME WAS PRETTY GLAD TO SEE IT
IT TOOK
AWAY ALL THE UNCOMFORTABLENESS AND WE FELT MIGHTY GOOD OVER IT BECAUSE
IT WOULD A BEEN A MISERABLE BUSINESS TO HAVE ANY UNFRIENDLINESS ON THE
RAFT FOR WHAT YOU WANT ABOVE ALL THINGS ON A RAFT IS FOR EVERYBODY
TO BE SATISFIED AND FEEL RIGHT AND KIND TOWARDS THE OTHERS
IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO MAKE UP MY MIND THAT THESE LIARS WARN'T NO
KINGS NOR DUKES AT ALL BUT JUST LOW DOWN HUMBUGS AND FRAUDS
BUT I
NEVER SAID NOTHING NEVER LET ON KEPT IT TO MYSELF IT'S THE BEST WAY
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE NO QUARRELS AND DON'T GET INTO NO TROUBLE
IF THEY
WANTED US TO CALL THEM KINGS AND DUKES I HADN'T NO OBJECTIONS 'LONG AS
IT WOULD KEEP PEACE IN THE FAMILY AND IT WARN'T NO USE TO TELL JIM SO
I DIDN'T TELL HIM
IF I NEVER LEARNT NOTHING ELSE OUT OF PAP I LEARNT
THAT THE BEST WAY TO GET ALONG WITH HIS KIND OF PEOPLE IS TO LET THEM
HAVE THEIR OWN WAY
CHAPTER XX
THEY ASKED US CONSIDERABLE MANY QUESTIONS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WE
COVERED UP THE RAFT THAT WAY FOR AND LAID BY IN THE DAYTIME INSTEAD OF
RUNNING WAS JIM A RUNAWAY NIGGER SAYS I
GOODNESS SAKES WOULD A RUNAWAY NIGGER RUN SOUTH
NO THEY ALLOWED HE WOULDN'T
I HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THINGS SOME WAY SO
I SAYS
MY FOLKS WAS LIVING IN PIKE COUNTY IN MISSOURI WHERE I WAS BORN AND
THEY ALL DIED OFF BUT ME AND PA AND MY BROTHER IKE
PA HE 'LOWED
HE'D BREAK UP AND GO DOWN AND LIVE WITH UNCLE BEN WHO'S GOT A LITTLE
ONE HORSE PLACE ON THE RIVER FORTY FOUR MILE BELOW ORLEANS
PA WAS
PRETTY POOR AND HAD SOME DEBTS SO WHEN HE'D SQUARED UP THERE WARN'T
NOTHING LEFT BUT SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND OUR NIGGER JIM
THAT WARN'T
ENOUGH TO TAKE US FOURTEEN HUNDRED MILE DECK PASSAGE NOR NO OTHER WAY
WELL WHEN THE RIVER ROSE PA HAD A STREAK OF LUCK ONE DAY HE KETCHED
THIS PIECE OF A RAFT SO WE RECKONED WE'D GO DOWN TO ORLEANS ON IT
PA'S LUCK DIDN'T HOLD OUT A STEAMBOAT RUN OVER THE FORRARD CORNER OF
THE RAFT ONE NIGHT AND WE ALL WENT OVERBOARD AND DOVE UNDER THE WHEEL
JIM AND ME COME UP ALL RIGHT BUT PA WAS DRUNK AND IKE WAS ONLY FOUR
YEARS OLD SO THEY NEVER COME UP NO MORE
WELL FOR THE NEXT DAY OR
TWO WE HAD CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE BECAUSE PEOPLE WAS ALWAYS COMING OUT IN
SKIFFS AND TRYING TO TAKE JIM AWAY FROM ME SAYING THEY BELIEVED HE WAS
A RUNAWAY NIGGER
WE DON'T RUN DAYTIMES NO MORE NOW NIGHTS THEY DON'T
BOTHER US
THE DUKE SAYS
LEAVE ME ALONE TO CIPHER OUT A WAY SO WE CAN RUN IN THE DAYTIME IF WE
WANT TO
I'LL THINK THE THING OVER I'LL INVENT A PLAN THAT'LL FIX IT
WE'LL LET IT ALONE FOR TO DAY BECAUSE OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT TO GO BY
THAT TOWN YONDER IN DAYLIGHT IT MIGHTN'T BE HEALTHY
TOWARDS NIGHT IT BEGUN TO DARKEN UP AND LOOK LIKE RAIN THE HEAT
LIGHTNING WAS SQUIRTING AROUND LOW DOWN IN THE SKY AND THE LEAVES WAS
BEGINNING TO SHIVER IT WAS GOING TO BE PRETTY UGLY IT WAS EASY TO SEE
THAT
SO THE DUKE AND THE KING WENT TO OVERHAULING OUR WIGWAM TO SEE
WHAT THE BEDS WAS LIKE
MY BED WAS A STRAW TICK BETTER THAN JIM'S
WHICH WAS A CORN SHUCK TICK THERE'S ALWAYS COBS AROUND ABOUT IN A SHUCK
TICK AND THEY POKE INTO YOU AND HURT AND WHEN YOU ROLL OVER THE DRY
SHUCKS SOUND LIKE YOU WAS ROLLING OVER IN A PILE OF DEAD LEAVES IT
MAKES SUCH A RUSTLING THAT YOU WAKE UP
WELL THE DUKE ALLOWED HE WOULD
TAKE MY BED BUT THE KING ALLOWED HE WOULDN'T
HE SAYS
I SHOULD A RECKONED THE DIFFERENCE IN RANK WOULD A SEJESTED TO YOU THAT
A CORN SHUCK BED WARN'T JUST FITTEN FOR ME TO SLEEP ON
YOUR GRACE 'LL
TAKE THE SHUCK BED YOURSELF
JIM AND ME WAS IN A SWEAT AGAIN FOR A MINUTE BEING AFRAID THERE WAS
GOING TO BE SOME MORE TROUBLE AMONGST THEM SO WE WAS PRETTY GLAD WHEN
THE DUKE SAYS
'TIS MY FATE TO BE ALWAYS GROUND INTO THE MIRE UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF
OPPRESSION
MISFORTUNE HAS BROKEN MY ONCE HAUGHTY SPIRIT I YIELD I
SUBMIT 'TIS MY FATE
I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD LET ME SUFFER CAN BEAR
IT
WE GOT AWAY AS SOON AS IT WAS GOOD AND DARK
THE KING TOLD US TO STAND
WELL OUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND NOT SHOW A LIGHT TILL WE
GOT A LONG WAYS BELOW THE TOWN
WE COME IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE BUNCH OF
LIGHTS BY AND BY THAT WAS THE TOWN YOU KNOW AND SLID BY ABOUT A HALF
A MILE OUT ALL RIGHT
WHEN WE WAS THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE BELOW WE
HOISTED UP OUR SIGNAL LANTERN AND ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK IT COME ON TO RAIN
AND BLOW AND THUNDER AND LIGHTEN LIKE EVERYTHING SO THE KING TOLD US
TO BOTH STAY ON WATCH TILL THE WEATHER GOT BETTER THEN HIM AND THE DUKE
CRAWLED INTO THE WIGWAM AND TURNED IN FOR THE NIGHT
IT WAS MY WATCH
BELOW TILL TWELVE BUT I WOULDN'T A TURNED IN ANYWAY IF I'D HAD A BED
BECAUSE A BODY DON'T SEE SUCH A STORM AS THAT EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK NOT
BY A LONG SIGHT
MY SOULS HOW THE WIND DID SCREAM ALONG AND EVERY
SECOND OR TWO THERE'D COME A GLARE THAT LIT UP THE WHITE CAPS FOR A HALF
A MILE AROUND AND YOU'D SEE THE ISLANDS LOOKING DUSTY THROUGH THE RAIN
AND THE TREES THRASHING AROUND IN THE WIND THEN COMES A H WHACK BUM
BUM BUMBLE UMBLE UM BUM BUM BUM BUM AND THE THUNDER WOULD GO RUMBLING
AND GRUMBLING AWAY AND QUIT AND THEN RIP COMES ANOTHER FLASH AND
ANOTHER SOCKDOLAGER
THE WAVES MOST WASHED ME OFF THE RAFT SOMETIMES
BUT I HADN'T ANY CLOTHES ON AND DIDN'T MIND
WE DIDN'T HAVE NO TROUBLE
ABOUT SNAGS THE LIGHTNING WAS GLARING AND FLITTERING AROUND SO CONSTANT
THAT WE COULD SEE THEM PLENTY SOON ENOUGH TO THROW HER HEAD THIS WAY OR
THAT AND MISS THEM
I HAD THE MIDDLE WATCH YOU KNOW BUT I WAS PRETTY SLEEPY BY THAT TIME
SO JIM HE SAID HE WOULD STAND THE FIRST HALF OF IT FOR ME HE WAS ALWAYS
MIGHTY GOOD THAT WAY JIM WAS
I CRAWLED INTO THE WIGWAM BUT THE KING
AND THE DUKE HAD THEIR LEGS SPRAWLED AROUND SO THERE WARN'T NO SHOW FOR
ME SO I LAID OUTSIDE I DIDN'T MIND THE RAIN BECAUSE IT WAS WARM AND
THE WAVES WARN'T RUNNING SO HIGH NOW
ABOUT TWO THEY COME UP AGAIN
THOUGH AND JIM WAS GOING TO CALL ME BUT HE CHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE
HE RECKONED THEY WARN'T HIGH ENOUGH YET TO DO ANY HARM BUT HE WAS
MISTAKEN ABOUT THAT FOR PRETTY SOON ALL OF A SUDDEN ALONG COMES A
REGULAR RIPPER AND WASHED ME OVERBOARD
IT MOST KILLED JIM A LAUGHING
HE WAS THE EASIEST NIGGER TO LAUGH THAT EVER WAS ANYWAY
I TOOK THE WATCH AND JIM HE LAID DOWN AND SNORED AWAY AND BY AND BY
THE STORM LET UP FOR GOOD AND ALL AND THE FIRST CABIN LIGHT THAT SHOWED
I ROUSTED HIM OUT AND WE SLID THE RAFT INTO HIDING QUARTERS FOR THE
DAY
THE KING GOT OUT AN OLD RATTY DECK OF CARDS AFTER BREAKFAST AND HIM
AND THE DUKE PLAYED SEVEN UP A WHILE FIVE CENTS A GAME
THEN THEY GOT
TIRED OF IT AND ALLOWED THEY WOULD LAY OUT A CAMPAIGN AS THEY CALLED
IT
THE DUKE WENT DOWN INTO HIS CARPET BAG AND FETCHED UP A LOT OF
LITTLE PRINTED BILLS AND READ THEM OUT LOUD
ONE BILL SAID THE
CELEBRATED DR
ARMAND DE MONTALBAN OF PARIS WOULD LECTURE ON THE
SCIENCE OF PHRENOLOGY AT SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE ON THE BLANK DAY OF
BLANK AT TEN CENTS ADMISSION AND FURNISH CHARTS OF CHARACTER AT
TWENTY FIVE CENTS APIECE THE DUKE SAID THAT WAS HIM
IN ANOTHER
BILL HE WAS THE WORLD RENOWNED SHAKESPEARIAN TRAGEDIAN GARRICK THE
YOUNGER OF DRURY LANE LONDON IN OTHER BILLS HE HAD A LOT OF OTHER
NAMES AND DONE OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS LIKE FINDING WATER AND GOLD WITH
A DIVINING ROD DISSIPATING WITCH SPELLS AND SO ON
BY AND BY HE
SAYS
BUT THE HISTRIONIC MUSE IS THE DARLING
HAVE YOU EVER TROD THE BOARDS
ROYALTY
NO SAYS THE KING
YOU SHALL THEN BEFORE YOU'RE THREE DAYS OLDER FALLEN GRANDEUR SAYS
THE DUKE
THE FIRST GOOD TOWN WE COME TO WE'LL HIRE A HALL AND DO THE
SWORD FIGHT IN RICHARD III
AND THE BALCONY SCENE IN ROMEO AND JULIET
HOW DOES THAT STRIKE YOU
I'M IN UP TO THE HUB FOR ANYTHING THAT WILL PAY BILGEWATER BUT YOU
SEE I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PLAY ACTIN' AND HAIN'T EVER SEEN MUCH
OF IT
I WAS TOO SMALL WHEN PAP USED TO HAVE 'EM AT THE PALACE
DO YOU
RECKON YOU CAN LEARN ME
EASY
ALL RIGHT
I'M JIST A FREEZN' FOR SOMETHING FRESH ANYWAY
LE'S
COMMENCE RIGHT AWAY
SO THE DUKE HE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT WHO ROMEO WAS AND WHO JULIET WAS AND
SAID HE WAS USED TO BEING ROMEO SO THE KING COULD BE JULIET
BUT IF JULIET'S SUCH A YOUNG GAL DUKE MY PEELED HEAD AND MY WHITE
WHISKERS IS GOIN' TO LOOK ONCOMMON ODD ON HER MAYBE
NO DON'T YOU WORRY THESE COUNTRY JAKES WON'T EVER THINK OF THAT
BESIDES YOU KNOW YOU'LL BE IN COSTUME AND THAT MAKES ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD JULIET'S IN A BALCONY ENJOYING THE MOONLIGHT
BEFORE SHE GOES TO BED AND SHE'S GOT ON HER NIGHT GOWN AND HER RUFFLED
NIGHTCAP
HERE ARE THE COSTUMES FOR THE PARTS
HE GOT OUT TWO OR THREE CURTAIN CALICO SUITS WHICH HE SAID WAS
MEEDYEVIL ARMOR FOR RICHARD III
AND T'OTHER CHAP AND A LONG WHITE
COTTON NIGHTSHIRT AND A RUFFLED NIGHTCAP TO MATCH
THE KING WAS
SATISFIED SO THE DUKE GOT OUT HIS BOOK AND READ THE PARTS OVER IN THE
MOST SPLENDID SPREAD EAGLE WAY PRANCING AROUND AND ACTING AT THE SAME
TIME TO SHOW HOW IT HAD GOT TO BE DONE THEN HE GIVE THE BOOK TO THE
KING AND TOLD HIM TO GET HIS PART BY HEART
THERE WAS A LITTLE ONE HORSE TOWN ABOUT THREE MILE DOWN THE BEND AND
AFTER DINNER THE DUKE SAID HE HAD CIPHERED OUT HIS IDEA ABOUT HOW TO RUN
IN DAYLIGHT WITHOUT IT BEING DANGERSOME FOR JIM SO HE ALLOWED HE WOULD
GO DOWN TO THE TOWN AND FIX THAT THING
THE KING ALLOWED HE WOULD GO
TOO AND SEE IF HE COULDN'T STRIKE SOMETHING
WE WAS OUT OF COFFEE SO
JIM SAID I BETTER GO ALONG WITH THEM IN THE CANOE AND GET SOME
WHEN WE GOT THERE THERE WARN'T NOBODY STIRRING STREETS EMPTY AND
PERFECTLY DEAD AND STILL LIKE SUNDAY
WE FOUND A SICK NIGGER SUNNING
HIMSELF IN A BACK YARD AND HE SAID EVERYBODY THAT WARN'T TOO YOUNG OR
TOO SICK OR TOO OLD WAS GONE TO CAMP MEETING ABOUT TWO MILE BACK IN THE
WOODS
THE KING GOT THE DIRECTIONS AND ALLOWED HE'D GO AND WORK THAT
CAMP MEETING FOR ALL IT WAS WORTH AND I MIGHT GO TOO
THE DUKE SAID WHAT HE WAS AFTER WAS A PRINTING OFFICE
WE FOUND IT
A LITTLE BIT OF A CONCERN UP OVER A CARPENTER SHOP CARPENTERS AND
PRINTERS ALL GONE TO THE MEETING AND NO DOORS LOCKED
IT WAS A DIRTY
LITTERED UP PLACE AND HAD INK MARKS AND HANDBILLS WITH PICTURES OF
HORSES AND RUNAWAY NIGGERS ON THEM ALL OVER THE WALLS
THE DUKE SHED
HIS COAT AND SAID HE WAS ALL RIGHT NOW
SO ME AND THE KING LIT OUT FOR
THE CAMP MEETING
WE GOT THERE IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR FAIRLY DRIPPING FOR IT WAS A MOST
AWFUL HOT DAY
THERE WAS AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE FROM
TWENTY MILE AROUND
THE WOODS WAS FULL OF TEAMS AND WAGONS HITCHED
EVERYWHERES FEEDING OUT OF THE WAGON TROUGHS AND STOMPING TO KEEP
OFF THE FLIES
THERE WAS SHEDS MADE OUT OF POLES AND ROOFED OVER WITH
BRANCHES WHERE THEY HAD LEMONADE AND GINGERBREAD TO SELL AND PILES OF
WATERMELONS AND GREEN CORN AND SUCH LIKE TRUCK
THE PREACHING WAS GOING ON UNDER THE SAME KINDS OF SHEDS ONLY THEY WAS
BIGGER AND HELD CROWDS OF PEOPLE
THE BENCHES WAS MADE OUT OF OUTSIDE
SLABS OF LOGS WITH HOLES BORED IN THE ROUND SIDE TO DRIVE STICKS INTO
FOR LEGS
THEY DIDN'T HAVE NO BACKS
THE PREACHERS HAD HIGH PLATFORMS
TO STAND ON AT ONE END OF THE SHEDS
THE WOMEN HAD ON SUN BONNETS
AND SOME HAD LINSEY WOOLSEY FROCKS SOME GINGHAM ONES AND A FEW OF THE
YOUNG ONES HAD ON CALICO
SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN WAS BAREFOOTED AND
SOME OF THE CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE ON ANY CLOTHES BUT JUST A TOW LINEN
SHIRT
SOME OF THE OLD WOMEN WAS KNITTING AND SOME OF THE YOUNG FOLKS
WAS COURTING ON THE SLY
THE FIRST SHED WE COME TO THE PREACHER WAS LINING OUT A HYMN
HE LINED
OUT TWO LINES EVERYBODY SUNG IT AND IT WAS KIND OF GRAND TO HEAR IT
THERE WAS SO MANY OF THEM AND THEY DONE IT IN SUCH A ROUSING WAY THEN
HE LINED OUT TWO MORE FOR THEM TO SING AND SO ON
THE PEOPLE WOKE UP
MORE AND MORE AND SUNG LOUDER AND LOUDER AND TOWARDS THE END SOME
BEGUN TO GROAN AND SOME BEGUN TO SHOUT
THEN THE PREACHER BEGUN TO
PREACH AND BEGUN IN EARNEST TOO AND WENT WEAVING FIRST TO ONE SIDE OF
THE PLATFORM AND THEN THE OTHER AND THEN A LEANING DOWN OVER THE FRONT
OF IT WITH HIS ARMS AND HIS BODY GOING ALL THE TIME AND SHOUTING HIS
WORDS OUT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND EVERY NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HOLD UP
HIS BIBLE AND SPREAD IT OPEN AND KIND OF PASS IT AROUND THIS WAY AND
THAT SHOUTING IT'S THE BRAZEN SERPENT IN THE WILDERNESS LOOK UPON
IT AND LIVE AND PEOPLE WOULD SHOUT OUT GLORY A A MEN AND SO
HE WENT ON AND THE PEOPLE GROANING AND CRYING AND SAYING AMEN
OH COME TO THE MOURNERS' BENCH COME BLACK WITH SIN AMEN COME
SICK AND SORE AMEN COME LAME AND HALT AND BLIND AMEN COME
PORE AND NEEDY SUNK IN SHAME A A MEN COME ALL THAT'S WORN AND
SOILED AND SUFFERING COME WITH A BROKEN SPIRIT COME WITH A CONTRITE
HEART COME IN YOUR RAGS AND SIN AND DIRT THE WATERS THAT CLEANSE
IS FREE THE DOOR OF HEAVEN STANDS OPEN OH ENTER IN AND BE AT REST
A A MEN GLORY GLORY HALLELUJAH
AND SO ON
YOU COULDN'T MAKE OUT WHAT THE PREACHER SAID ANY MORE ON
ACCOUNT OF THE SHOUTING AND CRYING
FOLKS GOT UP EVERYWHERES IN THE
CROWD AND WORKED THEIR WAY JUST BY MAIN STRENGTH TO THE MOURNERS'
BENCH WITH THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR FACES AND WHEN ALL THE
MOURNERS HAD GOT UP THERE TO THE FRONT BENCHES IN A CROWD THEY SUNG AND
SHOUTED AND FLUNG THEMSELVES DOWN ON THE STRAW JUST CRAZY AND WILD
WELL THE FIRST I KNOWED THE KING GOT A GOING AND YOU COULD HEAR HIM
OVER EVERYBODY AND NEXT HE WENT A CHARGING UP ON TO THE PLATFORM AND
THE PREACHER HE BEGGED HIM TO SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE AND HE DONE IT
HE
TOLD THEM HE WAS A PIRATE BEEN A PIRATE FOR THIRTY YEARS OUT IN THE
INDIAN OCEAN AND HIS CREW WAS THINNED OUT CONSIDERABLE LAST SPRING IN
A FIGHT AND HE WAS HOME NOW TO TAKE OUT SOME FRESH MEN AND THANKS TO
GOODNESS HE'D BEEN ROBBED LAST NIGHT AND PUT ASHORE OFF OF A STEAMBOAT
WITHOUT A CENT AND HE WAS GLAD OF IT IT WAS THE BLESSEDEST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A CHANGED MAN NOW AND HAPPY FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND POOR AS HE WAS HE WAS GOING TO START
RIGHT OFF AND WORK HIS WAY BACK TO THE INDIAN OCEAN AND PUT IN THE REST
OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO TURN THE PIRATES INTO THE TRUE PATH FOR HE COULD
DO IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE BEING ACQUAINTED WITH ALL PIRATE CREWS
IN THAT OCEAN AND THOUGH IT WOULD TAKE HIM A LONG TIME TO GET THERE
WITHOUT MONEY HE WOULD GET THERE ANYWAY AND EVERY TIME HE CONVINCED
A PIRATE HE WOULD SAY TO HIM DON'T YOU THANK ME DON'T YOU GIVE ME NO
CREDIT IT ALL BELONGS TO THEM DEAR PEOPLE IN POKEVILLE CAMP MEETING
NATURAL BROTHERS AND BENEFACTORS OF THE RACE AND THAT DEAR PREACHER
THERE THE TRUEST FRIEND A PIRATE EVER HAD
AND THEN HE BUSTED INTO TEARS AND SO DID EVERYBODY
THEN SOMEBODY
SINGS OUT TAKE UP A COLLECTION FOR HIM TAKE UP A COLLECTION WELL
A HALF A DOZEN MADE A JUMP TO DO IT BUT SOMEBODY SINGS OUT LET HIM
PASS THE HAT AROUND THEN EVERYBODY SAID IT THE PREACHER TOO
SO THE KING WENT ALL THROUGH THE CROWD WITH HIS HAT SWABBING HIS EYES
AND BLESSING THE PEOPLE AND PRAISING THEM AND THANKING THEM FOR BEING
SO GOOD TO THE POOR PIRATES AWAY OFF THERE AND EVERY LITTLE WHILE THE
PRETTIEST KIND OF GIRLS WITH THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR CHEEKS WOULD
UP AND ASK HIM WOULD HE LET THEM KISS HIM FOR TO REMEMBER HIM BY AND HE
ALWAYS DONE IT AND SOME OF THEM HE HUGGED AND KISSED AS MANY AS FIVE OR
SIX TIMES AND HE WAS INVITED TO STAY A WEEK AND EVERYBODY WANTED HIM TO
LIVE IN THEIR HOUSES AND SAID THEY'D THINK IT WAS AN HONOR BUT HE SAID
AS THIS WAS THE LAST DAY OF THE CAMP MEETING HE COULDN'T DO NO GOOD AND
BESIDES HE WAS IN A SWEAT TO GET TO THE INDIAN OCEAN RIGHT OFF AND GO TO
WORK ON THE PIRATES
WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE RAFT AND HE COME TO COUNT UP HE FOUND HE HAD
COLLECTED EIGHTY SEVEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS
AND THEN HE HAD
FETCHED AWAY A THREE GALLON JUG OF WHISKY TOO THAT HE FOUND UNDER A
WAGON WHEN HE WAS STARTING HOME THROUGH THE WOODS
THE KING SAID
TAKE IT ALL AROUND IT LAID OVER ANY DAY HE'D EVER PUT IN IN THE
MISSIONARYING LINE
HE SAID IT WARN'T NO USE TALKING HEATHENS DON'T
AMOUNT TO SHUCKS ALONGSIDE OF PIRATES TO WORK A CAMP MEETING WITH
THE DUKE WAS THINKING HE'D BEEN DOING PRETTY WELL TILL THE KING COME
TO SHOW UP BUT AFTER THAT HE DIDN'T THINK SO SO MUCH
HE HAD SET
UP AND PRINTED OFF TWO LITTLE JOBS FOR FARMERS IN THAT
PRINTING OFFICE HORSE BILLS AND TOOK THE MONEY FOUR DOLLARS
AND HE
HAD GOT IN TEN DOLLARS' WORTH OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THE PAPER WHICH HE
SAID HE WOULD PUT IN FOR FOUR DOLLARS IF THEY WOULD PAY IN ADVANCE SO
THEY DONE IT
THE PRICE OF THE PAPER WAS TWO DOLLARS A YEAR BUT HE TOOK
IN THREE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR HALF A DOLLAR APIECE ON CONDITION OF THEM
PAYING HIM IN ADVANCE THEY WERE GOING TO PAY IN CORDWOOD AND ONIONS AS
USUAL BUT HE SAID HE HAD JUST BOUGHT THE CONCERN AND KNOCKED DOWN THE
PRICE AS LOW AS HE COULD AFFORD IT AND WAS GOING TO RUN IT FOR CASH
HE SET UP A LITTLE PIECE OF POETRY WHICH HE MADE HIMSELF OUT OF
HIS OWN HEAD THREE VERSES KIND OF SWEET AND SADDISH THE NAME OF IT WAS
YES CRUSH COLD WORLD THIS BREAKING HEART AND HE LEFT THAT ALL SET
UP AND READY TO PRINT IN THE PAPER AND DIDN'T CHARGE NOTHING FOR IT
WELL HE TOOK IN NINE DOLLARS AND A HALF AND SAID HE'D DONE A PRETTY
SQUARE DAY'S WORK FOR IT
THEN HE SHOWED US ANOTHER LITTLE JOB HE'D PRINTED AND HADN'T CHARGED
FOR BECAUSE IT WAS FOR US
IT HAD A PICTURE OF A RUNAWAY NIGGER WITH
A BUNDLE ON A STICK OVER HIS SHOULDER AND 200 REWARD UNDER IT
THE
READING WAS ALL ABOUT JIM AND JUST DESCRIBED HIM TO A DOT
IT SAID
HE RUN AWAY FROM ST
JACQUES' PLANTATION FORTY MILE BELOW NEW ORLEANS
LAST WINTER AND LIKELY WENT NORTH AND WHOEVER WOULD CATCH HIM AND SEND
HIM BACK HE COULD HAVE THE REWARD AND EXPENSES
NOW SAYS THE DUKE AFTER TO NIGHT WE CAN RUN IN THE DAYTIME IF WE
WANT TO
WHENEVER WE SEE ANYBODY COMING WE CAN TIE JIM HAND AND FOOT
WITH A ROPE AND LAY HIM IN THE WIGWAM AND SHOW THIS HANDBILL AND SAY WE
CAPTURED HIM UP THE RIVER AND WERE TOO POOR TO TRAVEL ON A STEAMBOAT
SO WE GOT THIS LITTLE RAFT ON CREDIT FROM OUR FRIENDS AND ARE GOING DOWN
TO GET THE REWARD
HANDCUFFS AND CHAINS WOULD LOOK STILL BETTER ON JIM
BUT IT WOULDN'T GO WELL WITH THE STORY OF US BEING SO POOR
TOO MUCH
LIKE JEWELRY
ROPES ARE THE CORRECT THING WE MUST PRESERVE THE UNITIES
AS WE SAY ON THE BOARDS
WE ALL SAID THE DUKE WAS PRETTY SMART AND THERE COULDN'T BE NO TROUBLE
ABOUT RUNNING DAYTIMES
WE JUDGED WE COULD MAKE MILES ENOUGH THAT NIGHT
TO GET OUT OF THE REACH OF THE POWWOW WE RECKONED THE DUKE'S WORK IN
THE PRINTING OFFICE WAS GOING TO MAKE IN THAT LITTLE TOWN THEN WE COULD
BOOM RIGHT ALONG IF WE WANTED TO
WE LAID LOW AND KEPT STILL AND NEVER SHOVED OUT TILL NEARLY TEN
O'CLOCK THEN WE SLID BY PRETTY WIDE AWAY FROM THE TOWN AND DIDN'T
HOIST OUR LANTERN TILL WE WAS CLEAR OUT OF SIGHT OF IT
WHEN JIM CALLED ME TO TAKE THE WATCH AT FOUR IN THE MORNING HE SAYS
HUCK DOES YOU RECK'N WE GWYNE TO RUN ACROST ANY MO' KINGS ON DIS
TRIP
NO I SAYS I RECKON NOT
WELL SAYS HE DAT'S ALL RIGHT DEN
I DOAN' MINE ONE ER TWO KINGS
BUT DAT'S ENOUGH
DIS ONE'S POWERFUL DRUNK EN DE DUKE AIN' MUCH
BETTER
I FOUND JIM HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM TO TALK FRENCH SO HE COULD HEAR
WHAT IT WAS LIKE BUT HE SAID HE HAD BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY SO LONG AND
HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE HE'D FORGOT IT
CHAPTER XXI
IT WAS AFTER SUN UP NOW BUT WE WENT RIGHT ON AND DIDN'T TIE UP
THE
KING AND THE DUKE TURNED OUT BY AND BY LOOKING PRETTY RUSTY BUT AFTER
THEY'D JUMPED OVERBOARD AND TOOK A SWIM IT CHIPPERED THEM UP A GOOD
DEAL
AFTER BREAKFAST THE KING HE TOOK A SEAT ON THE CORNER OF THE RAFT
AND PULLED OFF HIS BOOTS AND ROLLED UP HIS BRITCHES AND LET HIS LEGS
DANGLE IN THE WATER SO AS TO BE COMFORTABLE AND LIT HIS PIPE AND WENT
TO GETTING HIS ROMEO AND JULIET BY HEART
WHEN HE HAD GOT IT PRETTY
GOOD HIM AND THE DUKE BEGUN TO PRACTICE IT TOGETHER
THE DUKE HAD TO
LEARN HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOW TO SAY EVERY SPEECH AND HE MADE HIM
SIGH AND PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART AND AFTER A WHILE HE SAID HE DONE
IT PRETTY WELL ONLY HE SAYS YOU MUSTN'T BELLOW OUT ROMEO
THAT WAY LIKE A BULL YOU MUST SAY IT SOFT AND SICK AND LANGUISHY
SO R O O MEO THAT IS THE IDEA FOR JULIET'S A DEAR SWEET MERE CHILD OF
A GIRL YOU KNOW AND SHE DOESN'T BRAY LIKE A JACKASS
WELL NEXT THEY GOT OUT A COUPLE OF LONG SWORDS THAT THE DUKE MADE OUT
OF OAK LATHS AND BEGUN TO PRACTICE THE SWORD FIGHT THE DUKE CALLED
HIMSELF RICHARD III AND THE WAY THEY LAID ON AND PRANCED AROUND
THE RAFT WAS GRAND TO SEE
BUT BY AND BY THE KING TRIPPED AND FELL
OVERBOARD AND AFTER THAT THEY TOOK A REST AND HAD A TALK ABOUT ALL
KINDS OF ADVENTURES THEY'D HAD IN OTHER TIMES ALONG THE RIVER
AFTER DINNER THE DUKE SAYS
WELL CAPET WE'LL WANT TO MAKE THIS A FIRST CLASS SHOW YOU KNOW SO
I GUESS WE'LL ADD A LITTLE MORE TO IT
WE WANT A LITTLE SOMETHING TO
ANSWER ENCORES WITH ANYWAY
WHAT'S ONKORES BILGEWATER
THE DUKE TOLD HIM AND THEN SAYS
I'LL ANSWER BY DOING THE HIGHLAND FLING OR THE SAILOR'S HORNPIPE AND
YOU WELL LET ME SEE OH I'VE GOT IT YOU CAN DO HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY
HAMLET'S WHICH
HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY YOU KNOW THE MOST CELEBRATED THING IN SHAKESPEARE
AH IT'S SUBLIME SUBLIME ALWAYS FETCHES THE HOUSE
I HAVEN'T GOT
IT IN THE BOOK I'VE ONLY GOT ONE VOLUME BUT I RECKON I CAN PIECE IT OUT
FROM MEMORY
I'LL JUST WALK UP AND DOWN A MINUTE AND SEE IF I CAN CALL
IT BACK FROM RECOLLECTION'S VAULTS
SO HE WENT TO MARCHING UP AND DOWN THINKING AND FROWNING HORRIBLE
EVERY NOW AND THEN THEN HE WOULD HOIST UP HIS EYEBROWS NEXT HE WOULD
SQUEEZE HIS HAND ON HIS FOREHEAD AND STAGGER BACK AND KIND OF MOAN NEXT
HE WOULD SIGH AND NEXT HE'D LET ON TO DROP A TEAR
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
TO SEE HIM
BY AND BY HE GOT IT
HE TOLD US TO GIVE ATTENTION
THEN
HE STRIKES A MOST NOBLE ATTITUDE WITH ONE LEG SHOVED FORWARDS AND HIS
ARMS STRETCHED AWAY UP AND HIS HEAD TILTED BACK LOOKING UP AT THE SKY
AND THEN HE BEGINS TO RIP AND RAVE AND GRIT HIS TEETH AND AFTER THAT
ALL THROUGH HIS SPEECH HE HOWLED AND SPREAD AROUND AND SWELLED UP HIS
CHEST AND JUST KNOCKED THE SPOTS OUT OF ANY ACTING EVER I SEE BEFORE
THIS IS THE SPEECH I LEARNED IT EASY ENOUGH WHILE HE WAS LEARNING IT
TO THE KING
TO BE OR NOT TO BE THAT IS THE BARE BODKIN THAT MAKES CALAMITY OF
SO LONG LIFE FOR WHO WOULD FARDELS BEAR TILL BIRNAM WOOD DO COME
TO DUNSINANE BUT THAT THE FEAR OF SOMETHING AFTER DEATH MURDERS THE
INNOCENT SLEEP GREAT NATURE'S SECOND COURSE AND MAKES US RATHER SLING
THE ARROWS OF OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE THAN FLY TO OTHERS THAT WE KNOW NOT OF
THERE'S THE RESPECT MUST GIVE US PAUSE WAKE DUNCAN WITH THY KNOCKING I
WOULD THOU COULDST FOR WHO WOULD BEAR THE WHIPS AND SCORNS OF TIME THE
OPPRESSOR'S WRONG THE PROUD MAN'S CONTUMELY THE LAW'S DELAY AND THE
QUIETUS WHICH HIS PANGS MIGHT TAKE
IN THE DEAD WASTE AND MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN IN CUSTOMARY SUITS OF SOLEMN BLACK BUT
THAT THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY FROM WHOSE BOURNE NO TRAVELER RETURNS
BREATHES FORTH CONTAGION ON THE WORLD AND THUS THE NATIVE HUE OF
RESOLUTION LIKE THE POOR CAT I' THE ADAGE IS SICKLIED O'ER WITH CARE
AND ALL THE CLOUDS THAT LOWERED O'ER OUR HOUSETOPS WITH THIS
REGARD THEIR CURRENTS TURN AWRY AND LOSE THE NAME OF ACTION
'TIS A
CONSUMMATION DEVOUTLY TO BE WISHED
BUT SOFT YOU THE FAIR OPHELIA OPE
NOT THY PONDEROUS AND MARBLE JAWS
BUT GET THEE TO A NUNNERY MDASH GO
WELL THE OLD MAN HE LIKED THAT SPEECH AND HE MIGHTY SOON GOT IT SO HE
COULD DO IT FIRST RATE
IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS JUST BORN FOR IT AND WHEN
HE HAD HIS HAND IN AND WAS EXCITED IT WAS PERFECTLY LOVELY THE WAY HE
WOULD RIP AND TEAR AND RAIR UP BEHIND WHEN HE WAS GETTING IT OFF
THE FIRST CHANCE WE GOT THE DUKE HE HAD SOME SHOW BILLS PRINTED AND
AFTER THAT FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AS WE FLOATED ALONG THE RAFT WAS A
MOST UNCOMMON LIVELY PLACE FOR THERE WARN'T NOTHING BUT SWORD FIGHTING
AND REHEARSING AS THE DUKE CALLED IT GOING ON ALL THE TIME
ONE MORNING
WHEN WE WAS PRETTY WELL DOWN THE STATE OF ARKANSAW WE COME IN SIGHT
OF A LITTLE ONE HORSE TOWN IN A BIG BEND SO WE TIED UP ABOUT
THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE ABOVE IT IN THE MOUTH OF A CRICK WHICH WAS
SHUT IN LIKE A TUNNEL BY THE CYPRESS TREES AND ALL OF US BUT JIM TOOK
THE CANOE AND WENT DOWN THERE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY CHANCE IN THAT
PLACE FOR OUR SHOW
WE STRUCK IT MIGHTY LUCKY THERE WAS GOING TO BE A CIRCUS THERE THAT
AFTERNOON AND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO COME IN IN
ALL KINDS OF OLD SHACKLY WAGONS AND ON HORSES
THE CIRCUS WOULD LEAVE
BEFORE NIGHT SO OUR SHOW WOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE
THE DUKE HE
HIRED THE COURT HOUSE AND WE WENT AROUND AND STUCK UP OUR BILLS
THEY

THEN WE WENT LOAFING AROUND THE TOWN
THE STORES AND HOUSES WAS MOST ALL
OLD SHACKLY DRIED UP FRAME CONCERNS THAT HADN'T EVER BEEN PAINTED THEY
WAS SET UP THREE OR FOUR FOOT ABOVE GROUND ON STILTS SO AS TO BE OUT OF
REACH OF THE WATER WHEN THE RIVER WAS OVERFLOWED
THE HOUSES HAD LITTLE
GARDENS AROUND THEM BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO RAISE HARDLY ANYTHING IN
THEM BUT JIMPSON WEEDS AND SUNFLOWERS AND ASH PILES AND OLD CURLED UP
BOOTS AND SHOES AND PIECES OF BOTTLES AND RAGS AND PLAYED OUT
TIN WARE
THE FENCES WAS MADE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOARDS NAILED ON
AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND THEY LEANED EVERY WHICH WAY AND HAD GATES THAT
DIDN'T GENERLY HAVE BUT ONE HINGE A LEATHER ONE
SOME OF THE FENCES
HAD BEEN WHITEWASHED SOME TIME OR ANOTHER BUT THE DUKE SAID IT WAS IN
CLUMBUS'S TIME LIKE ENOUGH
THERE WAS GENERLY HOGS IN THE GARDEN AND
PEOPLE DRIVING THEM OUT
ALL THE STORES WAS ALONG ONE STREET
THEY HAD WHITE DOMESTIC AWNINGS IN
FRONT AND THE COUNTRY PEOPLE HITCHED THEIR HORSES TO THE AWNING POSTS
THERE WAS EMPTY DRYGOODS BOXES UNDER THE AWNINGS AND LOAFERS ROOSTING
ON THEM ALL DAY LONG WHITTLING THEM WITH THEIR BARLOW KNIVES AND
CHAWING TOBACCO AND GAPING AND YAWNING AND STRETCHING A MIGHTY ORNERY
LOT
THEY GENERLY HAD ON YELLOW STRAW HATS MOST AS WIDE AS AN UMBRELLA
BUT DIDN'T WEAR NO COATS NOR WAISTCOATS THEY CALLED ONE ANOTHER BILL
AND BUCK AND HANK AND JOE AND ANDY AND TALKED LAZY AND DRAWLY AND
USED CONSIDERABLE MANY CUSS WORDS
THERE WAS AS MANY AS ONE LOAFER
LEANING UP AGAINST EVERY AWNING POST AND HE MOST ALWAYS HAD HIS HANDS
IN HIS BRITCHES POCKETS EXCEPT WHEN HE FETCHED THEM OUT TO LEND A CHAW
OF TOBACCO OR SCRATCH
WHAT A BODY WAS HEARING AMONGST THEM ALL THE
TIME WAS
GIMME A CHAW 'V TOBACKER HANK
CAIN'T I HAIN'T GOT BUT ONE CHAW LEFT
ASK BILL
MAYBE BILL HE GIVES HIM A CHAW MAYBE HE LIES AND SAYS HE AIN'T GOT
NONE
SOME OF THEM KINDS OF LOAFERS NEVER HAS A CENT IN THE WORLD NOR A
CHAW OF TOBACCO OF THEIR OWN
THEY GET ALL THEIR CHAWING BY BORROWING
THEY SAY TO A FELLOW I WISHT YOU'D LEN' ME A CHAW JACK I JIST THIS
MINUTE GIVE BEN THOMPSON THE LAST CHAW I HAD WHICH IS A LIE PRETTY
MUCH EVERYTIME IT DON'T FOOL NOBODY BUT A STRANGER BUT JACK AIN'T NO
STRANGER SO HE SAYS
YOU GIVE HIM A CHAW DID YOU SO DID YOUR SISTER'S CAT'S
GRANDMOTHER
YOU PAY ME BACK THE CHAWS YOU'VE AWREADY BORRY'D OFF'N ME
LAFE BUCKNER THEN I'LL LOAN YOU ONE OR TWO TON OF IT AND WON'T CHARGE
YOU NO BACK INTRUST NUTHER
WELL I DID PAY YOU BACK SOME OF IT WUNST
YES YOU DID 'BOUT SIX CHAWS
YOU BORRY'D STORE TOBACKER AND PAID BACK
NIGGER HEAD
STORE TOBACCO IS FLAT BLACK PLUG BUT THESE FELLOWS MOSTLY CHAWS THE
NATURAL LEAF TWISTED
WHEN THEY BORROW A CHAW THEY DON'T GENERLY CUT IT
OFF WITH A KNIFE BUT SET THE PLUG IN BETWEEN THEIR TEETH AND GNAW WITH
THEIR TEETH AND TUG AT THE PLUG WITH THEIR HANDS TILL THEY GET IT IN
TWO THEN SOMETIMES THE ONE THAT OWNS THE TOBACCO LOOKS MOURNFUL AT IT
WHEN IT'S HANDED BACK AND SAYS SARCASTIC
HERE GIMME THE CHAW AND YOU TAKE THE PLUG
ALL THE STREETS AND LANES WAS JUST MUD THEY WARN'T NOTHING ELSE BUT
MUD MUD AS BLACK AS TAR AND NIGH ABOUT A FOOT DEEP IN SOME PLACES
AND TWO OR THREE INCHES DEEP IN ALL THE PLACES
THE HOGS LOAFED AND
GRUNTED AROUND EVERYWHERES
YOU'D SEE A MUDDY SOW AND A LITTER OF PIGS
COME LAZYING ALONG THE STREET AND WHOLLOP HERSELF RIGHT DOWN IN THE WAY
WHERE FOLKS HAD TO WALK AROUND HER AND SHE'D STRETCH OUT AND SHUT HER
EYES AND WAVE HER EARS WHILST THE PIGS WAS MILKING HER AND LOOK AS
HAPPY AS IF SHE WAS ON SALARY
AND PRETTY SOON YOU'D HEAR A LOAFER
SING OUT HI SO BOY SICK HIM TIGE AND AWAY THE SOW WOULD GO
SQUEALING MOST HORRIBLE WITH A DOG OR TWO SWINGING TO EACH EAR AND
THREE OR FOUR DOZEN MORE A COMING AND THEN YOU WOULD SEE ALL THE
LOAFERS GET UP AND WATCH THE THING OUT OF SIGHT AND LAUGH AT THE FUN
AND LOOK GRATEFUL FOR THE NOISE
THEN THEY'D SETTLE BACK AGAIN TILL
THERE WAS A DOG FIGHT
THERE COULDN'T ANYTHING WAKE THEM UP ALL OVER
AND MAKE THEM HAPPY ALL OVER LIKE A DOG FIGHT UNLESS IT MIGHT BE
PUTTING TURPENTINE ON A STRAY DOG AND SETTING FIRE TO HIM OR TYING A
TIN PAN TO HIS TAIL AND SEE HIM RUN HIMSELF TO DEATH
ON THE RIVER FRONT SOME OF THE HOUSES WAS STICKING OUT OVER THE BANK
AND THEY WAS BOWED AND BENT AND ABOUT READY TO TUMBLE IN
THE PEOPLE
HAD MOVED OUT OF THEM
THE BANK WAS CAVED AWAY UNDER ONE CORNER OF SOME
OTHERS AND THAT CORNER WAS HANGING OVER
PEOPLE LIVED IN THEM YET BUT
IT WAS DANGERSOME BECAUSE SOMETIMES A STRIP OF LAND AS WIDE AS A HOUSE
CAVES IN AT A TIME
SOMETIMES A BELT OF LAND A QUARTER OF A MILE DEEP
WILL START IN AND CAVE ALONG AND CAVE ALONG TILL IT ALL CAVES INTO THE
RIVER IN ONE SUMMER
SUCH A TOWN AS THAT HAS TO BE ALWAYS MOVING BACK
AND BACK AND BACK BECAUSE THE RIVER'S ALWAYS GNAWING AT IT
THE NEARER IT GOT TO NOON THAT DAY THE THICKER AND THICKER WAS THE
WAGONS AND HORSES IN THE STREETS AND MORE COMING ALL THE TIME
FAMILIES FETCHED THEIR DINNERS WITH THEM FROM THE COUNTRY AND EAT THEM
IN THE WAGONS
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE WHISKY DRINKING GOING ON AND I
SEEN THREE FIGHTS
BY AND BY SOMEBODY SINGS OUT
HERE COMES OLD BOGGS IN FROM THE COUNTRY FOR HIS LITTLE OLD MONTHLY
DRUNK HERE HE COMES BOYS
ALL THE LOAFERS LOOKED GLAD I RECKONED THEY WAS USED TO HAVING FUN OUT
OF BOGGS
ONE OF THEM SAYS
WONDER WHO HE'S A GWYNE TO CHAW UP THIS TIME
IF HE'D A CHAWED UP ALL
THE MEN HE'S BEN A GWYNE TO CHAW UP IN THE LAST TWENTY YEAR HE'D HAVE
CONSIDERABLE RUPUTATION NOW
ANOTHER ONE SAYS I WISHT OLD BOGGS 'D THREATEN ME 'CUZ THEN I'D KNOW
I WARN'T GWYNE TO DIE FOR A THOUSAN' YEAR
BOGGS COMES A TEARING ALONG ON HIS HORSE WHOOPING AND YELLING LIKE AN
INJUN AND SINGING OUT
CLER THE TRACK THAR
I'M ON THE WAW PATH AND THE PRICE UV COFFINS IS
A GWYNE TO RAISE
HE WAS DRUNK AND WEAVING ABOUT IN HIS SADDLE HE WAS OVER FIFTY YEAR
OLD AND HAD A VERY RED FACE
EVERYBODY YELLED AT HIM AND LAUGHED AT
HIM AND SASSED HIM AND HE SASSED BACK AND SAID HE'D ATTEND TO THEM AND
LAY THEM OUT IN THEIR REGULAR TURNS BUT HE COULDN'T WAIT NOW BECAUSE
HE'D COME TO TOWN TO KILL OLD COLONEL SHERBURN AND HIS MOTTO WAS MEAT
FIRST AND SPOON VITTLES TO TOP OFF ON
HE SEE ME AND RODE UP AND SAYS
WHAR'D YOU COME F'M BOY YOU PREPARED TO DIE
THEN HE RODE ON
I WAS SCARED BUT A MAN SAYS
HE DON'T MEAN NOTHING HE'S ALWAYS A CARRYIN' ON LIKE THAT WHEN HE'S
DRUNK
HE'S THE BEST NATUREDEST OLD FOOL IN ARKANSAW NEVER HURT NOBODY
DRUNK NOR SOBER
BOGGS RODE UP BEFORE THE BIGGEST STORE IN TOWN AND BENT HIS HEAD DOWN
SO HE COULD SEE UNDER THE CURTAIN OF THE AWNING AND YELLS
COME OUT HERE SHERBURN COME OUT AND MEET THE MAN YOU'VE SWINDLED
YOU'RE THE HOUN' I'M AFTER AND I'M A GWYNE TO HAVE YOU TOO
AND SO HE WENT ON CALLING SHERBURN EVERYTHING HE COULD LAY HIS TONGUE
TO AND THE WHOLE STREET PACKED WITH PEOPLE LISTENING AND LAUGHING AND
GOING ON
BY AND BY A PROUD LOOKING MAN ABOUT FIFTY FIVE AND HE WAS A
HEAP THE BEST DRESSED MAN IN THAT TOWN TOO STEPS OUT OF THE STORE AND
THE CROWD DROPS BACK ON EACH SIDE TO LET HIM COME
HE SAYS TO BOGGS
MIGHTY CA'M AND SLOW HE SAYS
I'M TIRED OF THIS BUT I'LL ENDURE IT TILL ONE O'CLOCK
TILL ONE
O'CLOCK MIND NO LONGER
IF YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH AGAINST ME ONLY ONCE
AFTER THAT TIME YOU CAN'T TRAVEL SO FAR BUT I WILL FIND YOU
THEN HE TURNS AND GOES IN
THE CROWD LOOKED MIGHTY SOBER NOBODY
STIRRED AND THERE WARN'T NO MORE LAUGHING
BOGGS RODE OFF
BLACKGUARDING SHERBURN AS LOUD AS HE COULD YELL ALL DOWN THE STREET
AND PRETTY SOON BACK HE COMES AND STOPS BEFORE THE STORE STILL KEEPING
IT UP
SOME MEN CROWDED AROUND HIM AND TRIED TO GET HIM TO SHUT UP
BUT HE WOULDN'T THEY TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE ONE O'CLOCK IN ABOUT FIFTEEN
MINUTES AND SO HE MUST GO HOME HE MUST GO RIGHT AWAY
BUT IT DIDN'T
DO NO GOOD
HE CUSSED AWAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND THROWED HIS HAT DOWN
IN THE MUD AND RODE OVER IT AND PRETTY SOON AWAY HE WENT A RAGING DOWN
THE STREET AGAIN WITH HIS GRAY HAIR A FLYING
EVERYBODY THAT COULD GET
A CHANCE AT HIM TRIED THEIR BEST TO COAX HIM OFF OF HIS HORSE SO THEY
COULD LOCK HIM UP AND GET HIM SOBER BUT IT WARN'T NO USE UP THE STREET
HE WOULD TEAR AGAIN AND GIVE SHERBURN ANOTHER CUSSING
BY AND BY
SOMEBODY SAYS
GO FOR HIS DAUGHTER QUICK GO FOR HIS DAUGHTER SOMETIMES HE'LL LISTEN
TO HER
IF ANYBODY CAN PERSUADE HIM SHE CAN
SO SOMEBODY STARTED ON A RUN
I WALKED DOWN STREET A WAYS AND STOPPED
IN ABOUT FIVE OR TEN MINUTES HERE COMES BOGGS AGAIN BUT NOT ON HIS
HORSE
HE WAS A REELING ACROSS THE STREET TOWARDS ME BARE HEADED WITH
A FRIEND ON BOTH SIDES OF HIM A HOLT OF HIS ARMS AND HURRYING HIM ALONG
HE WAS QUIET AND LOOKED UNEASY AND HE WARN'T HANGING BACK ANY BUT WAS
DOING SOME OF THE HURRYING HIMSELF
SOMEBODY SINGS OUT
BOGGS
I LOOKED OVER THERE TO SEE WHO SAID IT AND IT WAS THAT COLONEL
SHERBURN
HE WAS STANDING PERFECTLY STILL IN THE STREET AND HAD A
PISTOL RAISED IN HIS RIGHT HAND NOT AIMING IT BUT HOLDING IT OUT WITH
THE BARREL TILTED UP TOWARDS THE SKY
THE SAME SECOND I SEE A YOUNG
GIRL COMING ON THE RUN AND TWO MEN WITH HER
BOGGS AND THE MEN TURNED
ROUND TO SEE WHO CALLED HIM AND WHEN THEY SEE THE PISTOL THE MEN
JUMPED TO ONE SIDE AND THE PISTOL BARREL COME DOWN SLOW AND STEADY TO
A LEVEL BOTH BARRELS COCKED
BOGGS THROWS UP BOTH OF HIS HANDS AND SAYS
O LORD DON'T SHOOT BANG GOES THE FIRST SHOT AND HE STAGGERS BACK
CLAWING AT THE AIR BANG GOES THE SECOND ONE AND HE TUMBLES BACKWARDS
ON TO THE GROUND HEAVY AND SOLID WITH HIS ARMS SPREAD OUT
THAT YOUNG
GIRL SCREAMED OUT AND COMES RUSHING AND DOWN SHE THROWS HERSELF ON HER
FATHER CRYING AND SAYING OH HE'S KILLED HIM HE'S KILLED HIM THE
CROWD CLOSED UP AROUND THEM AND SHOULDERED AND JAMMED ONE ANOTHER WITH
THEIR NECKS STRETCHED TRYING TO SEE AND PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE TRYING TO
SHOVE THEM BACK AND SHOUTING BACK BACK GIVE HIM AIR GIVE HIM AIR
COLONEL SHERBURN HE TOSSED HIS PISTOL ON TO THE GROUND AND TURNED
AROUND ON HIS HEELS AND WALKED OFF
THEY TOOK BOGGS TO A LITTLE DRUG STORE THE CROWD PRESSING AROUND JUST
THE SAME AND THE WHOLE TOWN FOLLOWING AND I RUSHED AND GOT A GOOD
PLACE AT THE WINDOW WHERE I WAS CLOSE TO HIM AND COULD SEE IN
THEY
LAID HIM ON THE FLOOR AND PUT ONE LARGE BIBLE UNDER HIS HEAD AND OPENED
ANOTHER ONE AND SPREAD IT ON HIS BREAST BUT THEY TORE OPEN HIS SHIRT
FIRST AND I SEEN WHERE ONE OF THE BULLETS WENT IN
HE MADE ABOUT A
DOZEN LONG GASPS HIS BREAST LIFTING THE BIBLE UP WHEN HE DRAWED IN HIS
BREATH AND LETTING IT DOWN AGAIN WHEN HE BREATHED IT OUT AND AFTER THAT
HE LAID STILL HE WAS DEAD
THEN THEY PULLED HIS DAUGHTER AWAY FROM
HIM SCREAMING AND CRYING AND TOOK HER OFF
SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN AND
VERY SWEET AND GENTLE LOOKING BUT AWFUL PALE AND SCARED
WELL PRETTY SOON THE WHOLE TOWN WAS THERE SQUIRMING AND SCROUGING AND
PUSHING AND SHOVING TO GET AT THE WINDOW AND HAVE A LOOK BUT PEOPLE
THAT HAD THE PLACES WOULDN'T GIVE THEM UP AND FOLKS BEHIND THEM WAS
SAYING ALL THE TIME SAY NOW YOU'VE LOOKED ENOUGH YOU FELLOWS
'TAIN'T RIGHT AND 'TAIN'T FAIR FOR YOU TO STAY THAR ALL THE TIME AND
NEVER GIVE NOBODY A CHANCE OTHER FOLKS HAS THEIR RIGHTS AS WELL AS
YOU
THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE JAWING BACK SO I SLID OUT THINKING MAYBE
THERE WAS GOING TO BE TROUBLE
THE STREETS WAS FULL AND EVERYBODY WAS
EXCITED
EVERYBODY THAT SEEN THE SHOOTING WAS TELLING HOW IT HAPPENED
AND THERE WAS A BIG CROWD PACKED AROUND EACH ONE OF THESE FELLOWS
STRETCHING THEIR NECKS AND LISTENING
ONE LONG LANKY MAN WITH LONG
HAIR AND A BIG WHITE FUR STOVEPIPE HAT ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND A
CROOKED HANDLED CANE MARKED OUT THE PLACES ON THE GROUND WHERE BOGGS
STOOD AND WHERE SHERBURN STOOD AND THE PEOPLE FOLLOWING HIM AROUND FROM
ONE PLACE TO T'OTHER AND WATCHING EVERYTHING HE DONE AND BOBBING THEIR
HEADS TO SHOW THEY UNDERSTOOD AND STOOPING A LITTLE AND RESTING THEIR
HANDS ON THEIR THIGHS TO WATCH HIM MARK THE PLACES ON THE GROUND WITH
HIS CANE AND THEN HE STOOD UP STRAIGHT AND STIFF WHERE SHERBURN HAD
STOOD FROWNING AND HAVING HIS HAT BRIM DOWN OVER HIS EYES AND SUNG
OUT BOGGS AND THEN FETCHED HIS CANE DOWN SLOW TO A LEVEL AND SAYS
BANG STAGGERED BACKWARDS SAYS BANG AGAIN AND FELL DOWN FLAT ON
HIS BACK
THE PEOPLE THAT HAD SEEN THE THING SAID HE DONE IT PERFECT
SAID IT WAS JUST EXACTLY THE WAY IT ALL HAPPENED
THEN AS MUCH AS A
DOZEN PEOPLE GOT OUT THEIR BOTTLES AND TREATED HIM
WELL BY AND BY SOMEBODY SAID SHERBURN OUGHT TO BE LYNCHED
IN ABOUT A
MINUTE EVERYBODY WAS SAYING IT SO AWAY THEY WENT MAD AND YELLING AND
SNATCHING DOWN EVERY CLOTHES LINE THEY COME TO TO DO THE HANGING WITH
CHAPTER XXII
THEY SWARMED UP TOWARDS SHERBURN'S HOUSE A WHOOPING AND RAGING LIKE
INJUNS AND EVERYTHING HAD TO CLEAR THE WAY OR GET RUN OVER AND TROMPED
TO MUSH AND IT WAS AWFUL TO SEE
CHILDREN WAS HEELING IT AHEAD OF THE
MOB SCREAMING AND TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AND EVERY WINDOW ALONG
THE ROAD WAS FULL OF WOMEN'S HEADS AND THERE WAS NIGGER BOYS IN EVERY
TREE AND BUCKS AND WENCHES LOOKING OVER EVERY FENCE AND AS SOON AS THE
MOB WOULD GET NEARLY TO THEM THEY WOULD BREAK AND SKADDLE BACK OUT OF
REACH
LOTS OF THE WOMEN AND GIRLS WAS CRYING AND TAKING ON SCARED
MOST TO DEATH
THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD
JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE
IT
WAS A LITTLE TWENTY FOOT YARD
SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR
DOWN THE FENCE THEN THERE WAS A RACKET OF RIPPING AND TEARING AND
SMASHING AND DOWN SHE GOES AND THE FRONT WALL OF THE CROWD BEGINS TO
ROLL IN LIKE A WAVE
JUST THEN SHERBURN STEPS OUT ON TO THE ROOF OF HIS LITTLE FRONT PORCH
WITH A DOUBLE BARREL GUN IN HIS HAND AND TAKES HIS STAND PERFECTLY
CA'M AND DELIBERATE NOT SAYING A WORD
THE RACKET STOPPED AND THE
WAVE SUCKED BACK
SHERBURN NEVER SAID A WORD JUST STOOD THERE LOOKING DOWN
THE
STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
SHERBURN RUN HIS EYE SLOW
ALONG THE CROWD AND WHEREVER IT STRUCK THE PEOPLE TRIED A LITTLE TO
OUT GAZE HIM BUT THEY COULDN'T THEY DROPPED THEIR EYES AND LOOKED
SNEAKY
THEN PRETTY SOON SHERBURN SORT OF LAUGHED NOT THE PLEASANT
KIND BUT THE KIND THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU ARE EATING BREAD
THAT'S GOT SAND IN IT
THEN HE SAYS SLOW AND SCORNFUL
THE IDEA OF YOU LYNCHING ANYBODY IT'S AMUSING
THE IDEA OF YOU
THINKING YOU HAD PLUCK ENOUGH TO LYNCH A MAN BECAUSE YOU'RE BRAVE
ENOUGH TO TAR AND FEATHER POOR FRIENDLESS CAST OUT WOMEN THAT COME ALONG
HERE DID THAT MAKE YOU THINK YOU HAD GRIT ENOUGH TO LAY YOUR HANDS ON A
MAN WHY A MAN'S SAFE IN THE HANDS OF TEN THOUSAND OF YOUR KIND AS
LONG AS IT'S DAYTIME AND YOU'RE NOT BEHIND HIM
DO I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU CLEAR THROUGH
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE
SOUTH AND I'VE LIVED IN THE NORTH SO I KNOW THE AVERAGE ALL AROUND
THE AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD
IN THE NORTH HE LETS ANYBODY WALK OVER HIM
THAT WANTS TO AND GOES HOME AND PRAYS FOR A HUMBLE SPIRIT TO BEAR IT
IN THE SOUTH ONE MAN ALL BY HIMSELF HAS STOPPED A STAGE FULL OF MEN
IN THE DAYTIME AND ROBBED THE LOT
YOUR NEWSPAPERS CALL YOU A
BRAVE PEOPLE SO MUCH THAT YOU THINK YOU ARE BRAVER THAN ANY OTHER
PEOPLE WHEREAS YOU'RE JUST AS BRAVE AND NO BRAVER
WHY DON'T YOUR
JURIES HANG MURDERERS BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE MAN'S FRIENDS WILL
SHOOT THEM IN THE BACK IN THE DARK AND IT'S JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO
SO THEY ALWAYS ACQUIT AND THEN A MAN GOES IN THE NIGHT WITH A
HUNDRED MASKED COWARDS AT HIS BACK AND LYNCHES THE RASCAL
YOUR MISTAKE
IS THAT YOU DIDN'T BRING A MAN WITH YOU THAT'S ONE MISTAKE AND THE
OTHER IS THAT YOU DIDN'T COME IN THE DARK AND FETCH YOUR MASKS
YOU
BROUGHT PART OF A MAN BUCK HARKNESS THERE AND IF YOU HADN'T HAD HIM
TO START YOU YOU'D A TAKEN IT OUT IN BLOWING
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME
THE AVERAGE MAN DON'T LIKE TROUBLE AND
DANGER
YOU DON'T LIKE TROUBLE AND DANGER
BUT IF ONLY HALF A
MAN LIKE BUCK HARKNESS THERE SHOUTS 'LYNCH HIM LYNCH HIM YOU'RE
AFRAID TO BACK DOWN AFRAID YOU'LL BE FOUND OUT TO BE WHAT YOU
ARE COWARDS AND SO YOU RAISE A YELL AND HANG YOURSELVES ON TO THAT
HALF A MAN'S COAT TAIL AND COME RAGING UP HERE SWEARING WHAT BIG
THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO DO
THE PITIFULEST THING OUT IS A MOB THAT'S
WHAT AN ARMY IS A MOB THEY DON'T FIGHT WITH COURAGE THAT'S BORN IN
THEM BUT WITH COURAGE THAT'S BORROWED FROM THEIR MASS AND FROM THEIR
OFFICERS
BUT A MOB WITHOUT ANY MAN AT THE HEAD OF IT IS BENEATH
PITIFULNESS
NOW THE THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO DROOP YOUR TAILS AND
GO HOME AND CRAWL IN A HOLE
IF ANY REAL LYNCHING'S GOING TO BE DONE IT
WILL BE DONE IN THE DARK SOUTHERN FASHION AND WHEN THEY COME THEY'LL
BRING THEIR MASKS AND FETCH A MAN ALONG
NOW LEAVE AND TAKE YOUR
HALF A MAN WITH YOU TOSSING HIS GUN UP ACROSS HIS LEFT ARM AND COCKING
IT WHEN HE SAYS THIS
THE CROWD WASHED BACK SUDDEN AND THEN BROKE ALL APART AND WENT TEARING
OFF EVERY WHICH WAY AND BUCK HARKNESS HE HEELED IT AFTER THEM LOOKING
TOLERABLE CHEAP
I COULD A STAYED IF I WANTED TO BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO
I WENT TO THE CIRCUS AND LOAFED AROUND THE BACK SIDE TILL THE WATCHMAN
WENT BY AND THEN DIVED IN UNDER THE TENT
I HAD MY TWENTY DOLLAR GOLD
PIECE AND SOME OTHER MONEY BUT I RECKONED I BETTER SAVE IT BECAUSE
THERE AIN'T NO TELLING HOW SOON YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IT AWAY FROM
HOME AND AMONGST STRANGERS THAT WAY
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
I AIN'T
OPPOSED TO SPENDING MONEY ON CIRCUSES WHEN THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY BUT
THERE AIN'T NO USE IN WASTING IT ON THEM
IT WAS A REAL BULLY CIRCUS
IT WAS THE SPLENDIDEST SIGHT THAT EVER WAS
WHEN THEY ALL COME RIDING IN TWO AND TWO A GENTLEMAN AND LADY SIDE
BY SIDE THE MEN JUST IN THEIR DRAWERS AND UNDERSHIRTS AND NO SHOES
NOR STIRRUPS AND RESTING THEIR HANDS ON THEIR THIGHS EASY AND
COMFORTABLE THERE MUST A BEEN TWENTY OF THEM AND EVERY LADY WITH A
LOVELY COMPLEXION AND PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL AND LOOKING JUST LIKE A GANG
OF REAL SURE ENOUGH QUEENS AND DRESSED IN CLOTHES THAT COST MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS AND JUST LITTERED WITH DIAMONDS
IT WAS A POWERFUL FINE SIGHT
I NEVER SEE ANYTHING SO LOVELY
AND THEN ONE BY ONE THEY GOT UP
AND STOOD AND WENT A WEAVING AROUND THE RING SO GENTLE AND WAVY AND
GRACEFUL THE MEN LOOKING EVER SO TALL AND AIRY AND STRAIGHT WITH THEIR
HEADS BOBBING AND SKIMMING ALONG AWAY UP THERE UNDER THE TENT ROOF AND
EVERY LADY'S ROSE LEAFY DRESS FLAPPING SOFT AND SILKY AROUND HER HIPS
AND SHE LOOKING LIKE THE MOST LOVELIEST PARASOL
AND THEN FASTER AND FASTER THEY WENT ALL OF THEM DANCING FIRST ONE
FOOT OUT IN THE AIR AND THEN THE OTHER THE HORSES LEANING MORE AND
MORE AND THE RINGMASTER GOING ROUND AND ROUND THE CENTER POLE CRACKING
HIS WHIP AND SHOUTING HI HI AND THE CLOWN CRACKING JOKES BEHIND
HIM AND BY AND BY ALL HANDS DROPPED THE REINS AND EVERY LADY PUT HER
KNUCKLES ON HER HIPS AND EVERY GENTLEMAN FOLDED HIS ARMS AND THEN HOW
THE HORSES DID LEAN OVER AND HUMP THEMSELVES AND SO ONE AFTER THE
OTHER THEY ALL SKIPPED OFF INTO THE RING AND MADE THE SWEETEST BOW I
EVER SEE AND THEN SCAMPERED OUT AND EVERYBODY CLAPPED THEIR HANDS AND
WENT JUST ABOUT WILD
WELL ALL THROUGH THE CIRCUS THEY DONE THE MOST ASTONISHING THINGS AND
ALL THE TIME THAT CLOWN CARRIED ON SO IT MOST KILLED THE PEOPLE
THE
RINGMASTER COULDN'T EVER SAY A WORD TO HIM BUT HE WAS BACK AT HIM QUICK
AS A WINK WITH THE FUNNIEST THINGS A BODY EVER SAID AND HOW HE EVER
COULD THINK OF SO MANY OF THEM AND SO SUDDEN AND SO PAT WAS WHAT I
COULDN'T NOWAY UNDERSTAND
WHY I COULDN'T A THOUGHT OF THEM IN A YEAR
AND BY AND BY A DRUNK MAN TRIED TO GET INTO THE RING SAID HE WANTED TO
RIDE SAID HE COULD RIDE AS WELL AS ANYBODY THAT EVER WAS
THEY ARGUED
AND TRIED TO KEEP HIM OUT BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN AND THE WHOLE SHOW
COME TO A STANDSTILL
THEN THE PEOPLE BEGUN TO HOLLER AT HIM AND MAKE
FUN OF HIM AND THAT MADE HIM MAD AND HE BEGUN TO RIP AND TEAR SO THAT
STIRRED UP THE PEOPLE AND A LOT OF MEN BEGUN TO PILE DOWN OFF OF THE
BENCHES AND SWARM TOWARDS THE RING SAYING KNOCK HIM DOWN THROW HIM
OUT AND ONE OR TWO WOMEN BEGUN TO SCREAM
SO THEN THE RINGMASTER
HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO
DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE
TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
SO EVERYBODY LAUGHED AND SAID ALL RIGHT AND THE MAN GOT ON
THE MINUTE
HE WAS ON THE HORSE BEGUN TO RIP AND TEAR AND JUMP AND CAVORT AROUND
WITH TWO CIRCUS MEN HANGING ON TO HIS BRIDLE TRYING TO HOLD HIM AND THE
DRUNK MAN HANGING ON TO HIS NECK AND HIS HEELS FLYING IN THE AIR EVERY
JUMP AND THE WHOLE CROWD OF PEOPLE STANDING UP SHOUTING AND LAUGHING
TILL TEARS ROLLED DOWN
AND AT LAST SURE ENOUGH ALL THE CIRCUS MEN
COULD DO THE HORSE BROKE LOOSE AND AWAY HE WENT LIKE THE VERY NATION
ROUND AND ROUND THE RING WITH THAT SOT LAYING DOWN ON HIM AND HANGING
TO HIS NECK WITH FIRST ONE LEG HANGING MOST TO THE GROUND ON ONE SIDE
AND THEN T'OTHER ONE ON T'OTHER SIDE AND THE PEOPLE JUST CRAZY
IT
WARN'T FUNNY TO ME THOUGH I WAS ALL OF A TREMBLE TO SEE HIS DANGER
BUT PRETTY SOON HE STRUGGLED UP ASTRADDLE AND GRABBED THE BRIDLE
A REELING THIS WAY AND THAT AND THE NEXT MINUTE HE SPRUNG UP AND
DROPPED THE BRIDLE AND STOOD AND THE HORSE A GOING LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE
TOO
HE JUST STOOD UP THERE A SAILING AROUND AS EASY AND COMFORTABLE
AS IF HE WARN'T EVER DRUNK IN HIS LIFE AND THEN HE BEGUN TO PULL OFF HIS
CLOTHES AND SLING THEM
HE SHED THEM SO THICK THEY KIND OF CLOGGED UP
THE AIR AND ALTOGETHER HE SHED SEVENTEEN SUITS
AND THEN THERE HE
WAS SLIM AND HANDSOME AND DRESSED THE GAUDIEST AND PRETTIEST YOU
EVER SAW AND HE LIT INTO THAT HORSE WITH HIS WHIP AND MADE HIM FAIRLY
HUM AND FINALLY SKIPPED OFF AND MADE HIS BOW AND DANCED OFF TO
THE DRESSING ROOM AND EVERYBODY JUST A HOWLING WITH PLEASURE AND
ASTONISHMENT
THEN THE RINGMASTER HE SEE HOW HE HAD BEEN FOOLED AND HE WAS THE
SICKEST RINGMASTER YOU EVER SEE I RECKON
WHY IT WAS ONE OF HIS OWN
MEN HE HAD GOT UP THAT JOKE ALL OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD AND NEVER LET ON
TO NOBODY
WELL I FELT SHEEPISH ENOUGH TO BE TOOK IN SO BUT I WOULDN'T
A BEEN IN THAT RINGMASTER'S PLACE NOT FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS
I DON'T
KNOW THERE MAY BE BULLIER CIRCUSES THAN WHAT THAT ONE WAS BUT I
NEVER STRUCK THEM YET
ANYWAYS IT WAS PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME AND
WHEREVER I RUN ACROSS IT IT CAN HAVE ALL OF MY CUSTOM EVERY TIME
WELL THAT NIGHT WE HAD OUR SHOW BUT THERE WARN'T ONLY ABOUT TWELVE
PEOPLE THERE JUST ENOUGH TO PAY EXPENSES
AND THEY LAUGHED ALL THE
TIME AND THAT MADE THE DUKE MAD AND EVERYBODY LEFT ANYWAY BEFORE
THE SHOW WAS OVER BUT ONE BOY WHICH WAS ASLEEP
SO THE DUKE SAID THESE
ARKANSAW LUNKHEADS COULDN'T COME UP TO SHAKESPEARE WHAT THEY WANTED
WAS LOW COMEDY AND MAYBE SOMETHING RUTHER WORSE THAN LOW COMEDY HE
RECKONED
HE SAID HE COULD SIZE THEIR STYLE
SO NEXT MORNING HE GOT
SOME BIG SHEETS OF WRAPPING PAPER AND SOME BLACK PAINT AND DRAWED OFF
SOME HANDBILLS AND STUCK THEM UP ALL OVER THE VILLAGE
THE BILLS SAID
CHAPTER XXIII
WELL ALL DAY HIM AND THE KING WAS HARD AT IT RIGGING UP A STAGE AND
A CURTAIN AND A ROW OF CANDLES FOR FOOTLIGHTS AND THAT NIGHT THE HOUSE
WAS JAM FULL OF MEN IN NO TIME
WHEN THE PLACE COULDN'T HOLD NO MORE
THE DUKE HE QUIT TENDING DOOR AND WENT AROUND THE BACK WAY AND COME ON
TO THE STAGE AND STOOD UP BEFORE THE CURTAIN AND MADE A LITTLE SPEECH
AND PRAISED UP THIS TRAGEDY AND SAID IT WAS THE MOST THRILLINGEST ONE
THAT EVER WAS AND SO HE WENT ON A BRAGGING ABOUT THE TRAGEDY AND ABOUT
EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER WHICH WAS TO PLAY THE MAIN PRINCIPAL PART IN IT
AND AT LAST WHEN HE'D GOT EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS UP HIGH ENOUGH HE
ROLLED UP THE CURTAIN AND THE NEXT MINUTE THE KING COME A PRANCING
OUT ON ALL FOURS NAKED AND HE WAS PAINTED ALL OVER
RING STREAKED AND STRIPED ALL SORTS OF COLORS AS SPLENDID AS A
RAINBOW
AND BUT NEVER MIND THE REST OF HIS OUTFIT IT WAS JUST WILD
BUT IT WAS AWFUL FUNNY
THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND
WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY
ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HAW HAWED TILL HE COME BACK AND DONE
IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO IT ANOTHER TIME
WELL IT
WOULD MAKE A COW LAUGH TO SEE THE SHINES THAT OLD IDIOT CUT
THEN THE DUKE HE LETS THE CURTAIN DOWN AND BOWS TO THE PEOPLE AND SAYS
THE GREAT TRAGEDY WILL BE PERFORMED ONLY TWO NIGHTS MORE ON ACCOUNTS OF
PRESSING LONDON ENGAGEMENTS WHERE THE SEATS IS ALL SOLD ALREADY FOR IT
IN DRURY LANE AND THEN HE MAKES THEM ANOTHER BOW AND SAYS IF HE HAS
SUCCEEDED IN PLEASING THEM AND INSTRUCTING THEM HE WILL BE DEEPLY
OBLEEGED IF THEY WILL MENTION IT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND GET THEM TO COME
AND SEE IT
TWENTY PEOPLE SINGS OUT
WHAT IS IT OVER IS THAT ALL
THE DUKE SAYS YES
THEN THERE WAS A FINE TIME
EVERYBODY SINGS
OUT SOLD AND ROSE UP MAD AND WAS A GOING FOR THAT STAGE AND THEM
TRAGEDIANS
BUT A BIG FINE LOOKING MAN JUMPS UP ON A BENCH AND SHOUTS
HOLD ON JUST A WORD GENTLEMEN THEY STOPPED TO LISTEN
WE ARE
SOLD MIGHTY BADLY SOLD

THIS WHOLE TOWN I RECKON AND NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF THIS THING AS LONG

SAME BOAT
AIN'T THAT SENSIBLE YOU BET IT IS THE JEDGE IS RIGHT
EVERYBODY SINGS OUT ALL RIGHT THEN NOT A WORD ABOUT ANY SELL

ALONG HOME AND ADVISE EVERYBODY TO COME AND SEE THE TRAGEDY
NEXT DAY YOU COULDN'T HEAR NOTHING AROUND THAT TOWN BUT HOW SPLENDID
THAT SHOW WAS
HOUSE WAS JAMMED AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND WE SOLD THIS
CROWD THE SAME WAY
WHEN ME AND THE KING AND THE DUKE GOT HOME TO THE
RAFT WE ALL HAD A SUPPER AND BY AND BY ABOUT MIDNIGHT THEY MADE JIM
AND ME BACK HER OUT AND FLOAT HER DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER AND
FETCH HER IN AND HIDE HER ABOUT TWO MILE BELOW TOWN
THE THIRD NIGHT THE HOUSE WAS CRAMMED AGAIN AND THEY WARN'T NEW COMERS
THIS TIME BUT PEOPLE THAT WAS AT THE SHOW THE OTHER TWO NIGHTS
I
STOOD BY THE DUKE AT THE DOOR AND I SEE THAT EVERY MAN THAT WENT IN HAD
HIS POCKETS BULGING OR SOMETHING MUFFLED UP UNDER HIS COAT AND I SEE IT
WARN'T NO PERFUMERY NEITHER NOT BY A LONG SIGHT
I SMELT SICKLY EGGS
BY THE BARREL AND ROTTEN CABBAGES AND SUCH THINGS AND IF I KNOW THE
SIGNS OF A DEAD CAT BEING AROUND AND I BET I DO THERE WAS SIXTY FOUR
OF THEM WENT IN
I SHOVED IN THERE FOR A MINUTE BUT IT WAS TOO VARIOUS
FOR ME I COULDN'T STAND IT
WELL WHEN THE PLACE COULDN'T HOLD NO MORE
PEOPLE THE DUKE HE GIVE A FELLOW A QUARTER AND TOLD HIM TO TEND DOOR
FOR HIM A MINUTE AND THEN HE STARTED AROUND FOR THE STAGE DOOR I AFTER
HIM BUT THE MINUTE WE TURNED THE CORNER AND WAS IN THE DARK HE SAYS
WALK FAST NOW TILL YOU GET AWAY FROM THE HOUSES AND THEN SHIN FOR THE
RAFT LIKE THE DICKENS WAS AFTER YOU
I DONE IT AND HE DONE THE SAME
WE STRUCK THE RAFT AT THE SAME TIME
AND IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS WE WAS GLIDING DOWN STREAM ALL DARK AND
STILL AND EDGING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER NOBODY SAYING A

CHAPTER XXIV
NEXT DAY TOWARDS NIGHT WE LAID UP UNDER A LITTLE WILLOW TOWHEAD OUT IN
THE MIDDLE WHERE THERE WAS A VILLAGE ON EACH SIDE OF THE RIVER AND THE
DUKE AND THE KING BEGUN TO LAY OUT A PLAN FOR WORKING THEM TOWNS
JIM
HE SPOKE TO THE DUKE AND SAID HE HOPED IT WOULDN'T TAKE BUT A FEW
HOURS BECAUSE IT GOT MIGHTY HEAVY AND TIRESOME TO HIM WHEN HE HAD TO
LAY ALL DAY IN THE WIGWAM TIED WITH THE ROPE
YOU SEE WHEN WE LEFT HIM
ALL ALONE WE HAD TO TIE HIM BECAUSE IF ANYBODY HAPPENED ON TO HIM ALL
BY HIMSELF AND NOT TIED IT WOULDN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE HE WAS A RUNAWAY
NIGGER YOU KNOW
SO THE DUKE SAID IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO HAVE TO LAY
ROPED ALL DAY AND HE'D CIPHER OUT SOME WAY TO GET AROUND IT
HE WAS UNCOMMON BRIGHT THE DUKE WAS AND HE SOON STRUCK IT
HE DRESSED
JIM UP IN KING LEAR'S OUTFIT IT WAS A LONG CURTAIN CALICO GOWN AND A
WHITE HORSE HAIR WIG AND WHISKERS AND THEN HE TOOK HIS THEATER PAINT
AND PAINTED JIM'S FACE AND HANDS AND EARS AND NECK ALL OVER A DEAD
DULL SOLID BLUE LIKE A MAN THAT'S BEEN DROWNDED NINE DAYS
BLAMED IF
HE WARN'T THE HORRIBLEST LOOKING OUTRAGE I EVER SEE
THEN THE DUKE TOOK
AND WROTE OUT A SIGN ON A SHINGLE SO
SICK ARAB BUT HARMLESS WHEN NOT OUT OF HIS HEAD
AND HE NAILED THAT SHINGLE TO A LATH AND STOOD THE LATH UP FOUR OR FIVE
FOOT IN FRONT OF THE WIGWAM
JIM WAS SATISFIED
HE SAID IT WAS A SIGHT
BETTER THAN LYING TIED A COUPLE OF YEARS EVERY DAY AND TREMBLING ALL
OVER EVERY TIME THERE WAS A SOUND
THE DUKE TOLD HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF
FREE AND EASY AND IF ANYBODY EVER COME MEDDLING AROUND HE MUST HOP
OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND CARRY ON A LITTLE AND FETCH A HOWL OR TWO LIKE
A WILD BEAST AND HE RECKONED THEY WOULD LIGHT OUT AND LEAVE HIM ALONE
WHICH WAS SOUND ENOUGH JUDGMENT BUT YOU TAKE THE AVERAGE MAN AND HE
WOULDN'T WAIT FOR HIM TO HOWL
WHY HE DIDN'T ONLY LOOK LIKE HE WAS
DEAD HE LOOKED CONSIDERABLE MORE THAN THAT
THESE RAPSCALLIONS WANTED TO TRY THE NONESUCH AGAIN BECAUSE THERE WAS
SO MUCH MONEY IN IT BUT THEY JUDGED IT WOULDN'T BE SAFE BECAUSE MAYBE
THE NEWS MIGHT A WORKED ALONG DOWN BY THIS TIME
THEY COULDN'T HIT NO
PROJECT THAT SUITED EXACTLY SO AT LAST THE DUKE SAID HE RECKONED HE'D
LAY OFF AND WORK HIS BRAINS AN HOUR OR TWO AND SEE IF HE COULDN'T PUT UP
SOMETHING ON THE ARKANSAW VILLAGE AND THE KING HE ALLOWED HE WOULD DROP
OVER TO T'OTHER VILLAGE WITHOUT ANY PLAN BUT JUST TRUST IN PROVIDENCE
TO LEAD HIM THE PROFITABLE WAY MEANING THE DEVIL I RECKON
WE HAD ALL
BOUGHT STORE CLOTHES WHERE WE STOPPED LAST AND NOW THE KING PUT HIS'N
ON AND HE TOLD ME TO PUT MINE ON
I DONE IT OF COURSE
THE KING'S
DUDS WAS ALL BLACK AND HE DID LOOK REAL SWELL AND STARCHY
I NEVER
KNOWED HOW CLOTHES COULD CHANGE A BODY BEFORE
WHY BEFORE HE LOOKED
LIKE THE ORNERIEST OLD RIP THAT EVER WAS BUT NOW WHEN HE'D TAKE OFF
HIS NEW WHITE BEAVER AND MAKE A BOW AND DO A SMILE HE LOOKED THAT GRAND
AND GOOD AND PIOUS THAT YOU'D SAY HE HAD WALKED RIGHT OUT OF THE ARK
AND MAYBE WAS OLD LEVITICUS HIMSELF
JIM CLEANED UP THE CANOE AND I
GOT MY PADDLE READY
THERE WAS A BIG STEAMBOAT LAYING AT THE SHORE AWAY
UP UNDER THE POINT ABOUT THREE MILE ABOVE THE TOWN BEEN THERE A COUPLE
OF HOURS TAKING ON FREIGHT
SAYS THE KING
SEEIN' HOW I'M DRESSED I RECKON MAYBE I BETTER ARRIVE DOWN FROM ST
LOUIS OR CINCINNATI OR SOME OTHER BIG PLACE
GO FOR THE STEAMBOAT
HUCKLEBERRY WE'LL COME DOWN TO THE VILLAGE ON HER
I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ORDERED TWICE TO GO AND TAKE A STEAMBOAT RIDE
I FETCHED THE SHORE A HALF A MILE ABOVE THE VILLAGE AND THEN WENT
SCOOTING ALONG THE BLUFF BANK IN THE EASY WATER
PRETTY SOON WE COME TO
A NICE INNOCENT LOOKING YOUNG COUNTRY JAKE SETTING ON A LOG SWABBING THE
SWEAT OFF OF HIS FACE FOR IT WAS POWERFUL WARM WEATHER AND HE HAD A
COUPLE OF BIG CARPET BAGS BY HIM
RUN HER NOSE IN SHORE SAYS THE KING
I DONE IT
WHER' YOU BOUND
FOR YOUNG MAN
FOR THE STEAMBOAT GOING TO ORLEANS
GIT ABOARD SAYS THE KING
HOLD ON A MINUTE MY SERVANT 'LL HE'P YOU
WITH THEM BAGS
JUMP OUT AND HE'P THE GENTLEMAN ADOLPHUS MEANING ME
I SEE
I DONE SO AND THEN WE ALL THREE STARTED ON AGAIN
THE YOUNG CHAP WAS
MIGHTY THANKFUL SAID IT WAS TOUGH WORK TOTING HIS BAGGAGE SUCH WEATHER
HE ASKED THE KING WHERE HE WAS GOING AND THE KING TOLD HIM HE'D COME
DOWN THE RIVER AND LANDED AT THE OTHER VILLAGE THIS MORNING AND NOW HE
WAS GOING UP A FEW MILE TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND ON A FARM UP THERE
THE
YOUNG FELLOW SAYS
WHEN I FIRST SEE YOU I SAYS TO MYSELF 'IT'S MR
WILKS SURE AND HE
COME MIGHTY NEAR GETTING HERE IN TIME BUT THEN I SAYS AGAIN 'NO I
RECKON IT AIN'T HIM OR ELSE HE WOULDN'T BE PADDLING UP THE RIVER YOU
AIN'T HIM ARE YOU
NO MY NAME'S BLODGETT ELEXANDER BLODGETT REVEREND ELEXANDER
BLODGETT I S'POSE I MUST SAY AS I'M ONE O' THE LORD'S POOR SERVANTS
BUT STILL I'M JIST AS ABLE TO BE SORRY FOR MR
WILKS FOR NOT ARRIVING
IN TIME ALL THE SAME IF HE'S MISSED ANYTHING BY IT WHICH I HOPE HE
HASN'T
WELL HE DON'T MISS ANY PROPERTY BY IT BECAUSE HE'LL GET THAT ALL
RIGHT BUT HE'S MISSED SEEING HIS BROTHER PETER DIE WHICH HE MAYN'T
MIND NOBODY CAN TELL AS TO THAT BUT HIS BROTHER WOULD A GIVE ANYTHING
IN THIS WORLD TO SEE HIM BEFORE HE DIED NEVER TALKED ABOUT NOTHING
ELSE ALL THESE THREE WEEKS HADN'T SEEN HIM SINCE THEY WAS BOYS
TOGETHER AND HADN'T EVER SEEN HIS BROTHER WILLIAM AT ALL THAT'S THE DEEF
AND DUMB ONE WILLIAM AIN'T MORE THAN THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE
PETER AND
GEORGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT COME OUT HERE GEORGE WAS THE MARRIED
BROTHER HIM AND HIS WIFE BOTH DIED LAST YEAR
HARVEY AND WILLIAM'S THE
ONLY ONES THAT'S LEFT NOW AND AS I WAS SAYING THEY HAVEN'T GOT HERE
IN TIME
DID ANYBODY SEND 'EM WORD
OH YES A MONTH OR TWO AGO WHEN PETER WAS FIRST TOOK BECAUSE PETER
SAID THEN THAT HE SORTER FELT LIKE HE WARN'T GOING TO GET WELL THIS
TIME
YOU SEE HE WAS PRETTY OLD AND GEORGE'S G'YIRLS WAS TOO YOUNG TO
BE MUCH COMPANY FOR HIM EXCEPT MARY JANE THE RED HEADED ONE AND SO HE
WAS KINDER LONESOME AFTER GEORGE AND HIS WIFE DIED AND DIDN'T SEEM
TO CARE MUCH TO LIVE
HE MOST DESPERATELY WANTED TO SEE HARVEY AND
WILLIAM TOO FOR THAT MATTER BECAUSE HE WAS ONE OF THEM KIND THAT CAN'T
BEAR TO MAKE A WILL
HE LEFT A LETTER BEHIND FOR HARVEY AND SAID HE'D
TOLD IN IT WHERE HIS MONEY WAS HID AND HOW HE WANTED THE REST OF THE
PROPERTY DIVIDED UP SO GEORGE'S G'YIRLS WOULD BE ALL RIGHT FOR GEORGE
DIDN'T LEAVE NOTHING
AND THAT LETTER WAS ALL THEY COULD GET HIM TO PUT
A PEN TO
WHY DO YOU RECKON HARVEY DON'T COME WHER' DOES HE LIVE
OH HE LIVES IN ENGLAND SHEFFIELD PREACHES THERE HASN'T EVER BEEN IN
THIS COUNTRY
HE HASN'T HAD ANY TOO MUCH TIME AND BESIDES HE MIGHTN'T A
GOT THE LETTER AT ALL YOU KNOW
TOO BAD TOO BAD HE COULDN'T A LIVED TO SEE HIS BROTHERS POOR SOUL
YOU GOING TO ORLEANS YOU SAY
YES BUT THAT AIN'T ONLY A PART OF IT
I'M GOING IN A SHIP NEXT
WEDNESDAY FOR RYO JANEERO WHERE MY UNCLE LIVES

MARY JANE'S NINETEEN SUSAN'S FIFTEEN AND JOANNA'S ABOUT
FOURTEEN THAT'S THE ONE THAT GIVES HERSELF TO GOOD WORKS AND HAS A
HARE LIP
POOR THINGS TO BE LEFT ALONE IN THE COLD WORLD SO
WELL THEY COULD BE WORSE OFF
OLD PETER HAD FRIENDS AND THEY
AIN'T GOING TO LET THEM COME TO NO HARM
THERE'S HOBSON THE BABTIS'
PREACHER AND DEACON LOT HOVEY AND BEN RUCKER AND ABNER SHACKLEFORD
AND LEVI BELL THE LAWYER AND DR
ROBINSON AND THEIR WIVES AND THE
WIDOW BARTLEY AND WELL THERE'S A LOT OF THEM BUT THESE ARE THE ONES
THAT PETER WAS THICKEST WITH AND USED TO WRITE ABOUT SOMETIMES WHEN
HE WROTE HOME SO HARVEY 'LL KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR FRIENDS WHEN HE GETS
HERE
WELL THE OLD MAN WENT ON ASKING QUESTIONS TILL HE JUST FAIRLY EMPTIED
THAT YOUNG FELLOW
BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T INQUIRE ABOUT EVERYBODY AND
EVERYTHING IN THAT BLESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE WILKSES AND ABOUT
PETER'S BUSINESS WHICH WAS A TANNER AND ABOUT GEORGE'S WHICH WAS A
CARPENTER AND ABOUT HARVEY'S WHICH WAS A DISSENTERING MINISTER AND SO
ON AND SO ON
THEN HE SAYS
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO WALK ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STEAMBOAT FOR
BECAUSE SHE'S A BIG ORLEANS BOAT AND I WAS AFEARD SHE MIGHTN'T STOP
THERE
WHEN THEY'RE DEEP THEY WON'T STOP FOR A HAIL
A CINCINNATI BOAT
WILL BUT THIS IS A ST
LOUIS ONE
WAS PETER WILKS WELL OFF
OH YES PRETTY WELL OFF
HE HAD HOUSES AND LAND AND IT'S RECKONED HE
LEFT THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND IN CASH HID UP SOM'ERS
WHEN DID YOU SAY HE DIED
I DIDN'T SAY BUT IT WAS LAST NIGHT
FUNERAL TO MORROW LIKELY
YES 'BOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
WELL IT'S ALL TERRIBLE SAD BUT WE'VE ALL GOT TO GO ONE TIME OR
ANOTHER
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS TO BE PREPARED THEN WE'RE ALL RIGHT
YES SIR IT'S THE BEST WAY
MA USED TO ALWAYS SAY THAT
WHEN WE STRUCK THE BOAT SHE WAS ABOUT DONE LOADING AND PRETTY SOON SHE
GOT OFF
THE KING NEVER SAID NOTHING ABOUT GOING ABOARD SO I LOST
MY RIDE AFTER ALL
WHEN THE BOAT WAS GONE THE KING MADE ME PADDLE UP
ANOTHER MILE TO A LONESOME PLACE AND THEN HE GOT ASHORE AND SAYS
NOW HUSTLE BACK RIGHT OFF AND FETCH THE DUKE UP HERE AND THE NEW
CARPET BAGS
AND IF HE'S GONE OVER TO T'OTHER SIDE GO OVER THERE AND
GIT HIM
AND TELL HIM TO GIT HIMSELF UP REGARDLESS
SHOVE ALONG NOW
I SEE WHAT HE WAS UP TO BUT I NEVER SAID NOTHING OF COURSE
WHEN
I GOT BACK WITH THE DUKE WE HID THE CANOE AND THEN THEY SET DOWN ON A
LOG AND THE KING TOLD HIM EVERYTHING JUST LIKE THE YOUNG FELLOW HAD
SAID IT EVERY LAST WORD OF IT
AND ALL THE TIME HE WAS A DOING IT HE
TRIED TO TALK LIKE AN ENGLISHMAN AND HE DONE IT PRETTY WELL TOO FOR
A SLOUCH
I CAN'T IMITATE HIM AND SO I AIN'T A GOING TO TRY TO BUT HE
REALLY DONE IT PRETTY GOOD
THEN HE SAYS
HOW ARE YOU ON THE DEEF AND DUMB BILGEWATER
THE DUKE SAID LEAVE HIM ALONE FOR THAT SAID HE HAD PLAYED A DEEF
AND DUMB PERSON ON THE HISTRONIC BOARDS
SO THEN THEY WAITED FOR A
STEAMBOAT
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON A COUPLE OF LITTLE BOATS COME ALONG
BUT THEY DIDN'T COME FROM HIGH ENOUGH UP THE RIVER BUT AT LAST THERE
WAS A BIG ONE AND THEY HAILED HER
SHE SENT OUT HER YAWL AND WE WENT
ABOARD AND SHE WAS FROM CINCINNATI AND WHEN THEY FOUND WE ONLY WANTED
TO GO FOUR OR FIVE MILE THEY WAS BOOMING MAD AND GAVE US A CUSSING AND
SAID THEY WOULDN'T LAND US
BUT THE KING WAS CA'M
HE SAYS
IF GENTLEMEN KIN AFFORD TO PAY A DOLLAR A MILE APIECE TO BE TOOK ON AND
PUT OFF IN A YAWL A STEAMBOAT KIN AFFORD TO CARRY 'EM CAN'T IT
SO THEY SOFTENED DOWN AND SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND WHEN WE GOT TO THE
VILLAGE THEY YAWLED US ASHORE
ABOUT TWO DOZEN MEN FLOCKED DOWN WHEN
THEY SEE THE YAWL A COMING AND WHEN THE KING SAYS
KIN ANY OF YOU GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHER' MR
PETER WILKS LIVES THEY
GIVE A GLANCE AT ONE ANOTHER AND NODDED THEIR HEADS AS MUCH AS TO SAY
WHAT D' I TELL YOU THEN ONE OF THEM SAYS KIND OF SOFT AND GENTLE
I'M SORRY SIR BUT THE BEST WE CAN DO IS TO TELL YOU WHERE HE DID
LIVE YESTERDAY EVENING
SUDDEN AS WINKING THE ORNERY OLD CRETUR WENT AN TO SMASH AND FELL UP
AGAINST THE MAN AND PUT HIS CHIN ON HIS SHOULDER AND CRIED DOWN HIS
BACK AND SAYS
ALAS ALAS OUR POOR BROTHER GONE AND WE NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM OH
IT'S TOO TOO HARD
THEN HE TURNS AROUND BLUBBERING AND MAKES A LOT OF IDIOTIC SIGNS TO
THE DUKE ON HIS HANDS AND BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T DROP A CARPET BAG AND
BUST OUT A CRYING
IF THEY WARN'T THE BEATENEST LOT THEM TWO FRAUDS
THAT EVER I STRUCK
WELL THE MEN GATHERED AROUND AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THEM AND SAID ALL
SORTS OF KIND THINGS TO THEM AND CARRIED THEIR CARPET BAGS UP THE HILL
FOR THEM AND LET THEM LEAN ON THEM AND CRY AND TOLD THE KING ALL ABOUT
HIS BROTHER'S LAST MOMENTS AND THE KING HE TOLD IT ALL OVER AGAIN ON
HIS HANDS TO THE DUKE AND BOTH OF THEM TOOK ON ABOUT THAT DEAD TANNER
LIKE THEY'D LOST THE TWELVE DISCIPLES
WELL IF EVER I STRUCK ANYTHING
LIKE IT I'M A NIGGER
IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE A BODY ASHAMED OF THE HUMAN
RACE
CHAPTER XXV
THE NEWS WAS ALL OVER TOWN IN TWO MINUTES AND YOU COULD SEE THE PEOPLE
TEARING DOWN ON THE RUN FROM EVERY WHICH WAY SOME OF THEM PUTTING ON
THEIR COATS AS THEY COME
PRETTY SOON WE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CROWD
AND THE NOISE OF THE TRAMPING WAS LIKE A SOLDIER MARCH
THE WINDOWS AND
DOORYARDS WAS FULL AND EVERY MINUTE SOMEBODY WOULD SAY OVER A FENCE
IS IT THEM
AND SOMEBODY TROTTING ALONG WITH THE GANG WOULD ANSWER BACK AND SAY
YOU BET IT IS
WHEN WE GOT TO THE HOUSE THE STREET IN FRONT OF IT WAS PACKED AND THE
THREE GIRLS WAS STANDING IN THE DOOR
MARY JANE WAS RED HEADED BUT
THAT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SHE WAS MOST AWFUL BEAUTIFUL AND HER
FACE AND HER EYES WAS ALL LIT UP LIKE GLORY SHE WAS SO GLAD HER UNCLES
WAS COME
THE KING HE SPREAD HIS ARMS AND MARY JANE SHE JUMPED FOR
THEM AND THE HARE LIP JUMPED FOR THE DUKE AND THERE THEY HAD IT
EVERYBODY MOST LEASTWAYS WOMEN CRIED FOR JOY TO SEE THEM MEET AGAIN
AT LAST AND HAVE SUCH GOOD TIMES
THEN THE KING HE HUNCHED THE DUKE PRIVATE I SEE HIM DO IT AND THEN HE
LOOKED AROUND AND SEE THE COFFIN OVER IN THE CORNER ON TWO CHAIRS SO
THEN HIM AND THE DUKE WITH A HAND ACROSS EACH OTHER'S SHOULDER AND
T'OTHER HAND TO THEIR EYES WALKED SLOW AND SOLEMN OVER THERE EVERYBODY
DROPPING BACK TO GIVE THEM ROOM AND ALL THE TALK AND NOISE STOPPING
PEOPLE SAYING SH AND ALL THE MEN TAKING THEIR HATS OFF AND DROOPING
THEIR HEADS SO YOU COULD A HEARD A PIN FALL
AND WHEN THEY GOT THERE
THEY BENT OVER AND LOOKED IN THE COFFIN AND TOOK ONE SIGHT AND THEN
THEY BUST OUT A CRYING SO YOU COULD A HEARD THEM TO ORLEANS MOST AND
THEN THEY PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER'S NECKS AND HUNG THEIR CHINS
OVER EACH OTHER'S SHOULDERS AND THEN FOR THREE MINUTES OR MAYBE FOUR
I NEVER SEE TWO MEN LEAK THE WAY THEY DONE
AND MIND YOU EVERYBODY
WAS DOING THE SAME AND THE PLACE WAS THAT DAMP I NEVER SEE ANYTHING
LIKE IT
THEN ONE OF THEM GOT ON ONE SIDE OF THE COFFIN AND T'OTHER ON
T'OTHER SIDE AND THEY KNEELED DOWN AND RESTED THEIR FOREHEADS ON THE
COFFIN AND LET ON TO PRAY ALL TO THEMSELVES
WELL WHEN IT COME
TO THAT IT WORKED THE CROWD LIKE YOU NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT AND
EVERYBODY BROKE DOWN AND WENT TO SOBBING RIGHT OUT LOUD THE POOR GIRLS
TOO AND EVERY WOMAN NEARLY WENT UP TO THE GIRLS WITHOUT SAYING A
WORD AND KISSED THEM SOLEMN ON THE FOREHEAD AND THEN PUT THEIR HAND
ON THEIR HEAD AND LOOKED UP TOWARDS THE SKY WITH THE TEARS RUNNING
DOWN AND THEN BUSTED OUT AND WENT OFF SOBBING AND SWABBING AND GIVE
THE NEXT WOMAN A SHOW
I NEVER SEE ANYTHING SO DISGUSTING
WELL BY AND BY THE KING HE GETS UP AND COMES FORWARD A LITTLE AND
WORKS HIMSELF UP AND SLOBBERS OUT A SPEECH ALL FULL OF TEARS AND
FLAPDOODLE ABOUT ITS BEING A SORE TRIAL FOR HIM AND HIS POOR BROTHER
TO LOSE THE DISEASED AND TO MISS SEEING DISEASED ALIVE AFTER THE LONG
JOURNEY OF FOUR THOUSAND MILE BUT IT'S A TRIAL THAT'S SWEETENED AND
SANCTIFIED TO US BY THIS DEAR SYMPATHY AND THESE HOLY TEARS AND SO HE
THANKS THEM OUT OF HIS HEART AND OUT OF HIS BROTHER'S HEART BECAUSE OUT
OF THEIR MOUTHS THEY CAN'T WORDS BEING TOO WEAK AND COLD AND ALL THAT
KIND OF ROT AND SLUSH TILL IT WAS JUST SICKENING AND THEN HE BLUBBERS
OUT A PIOUS GOODY GOODY AMEN AND TURNS HIMSELF LOOSE AND GOES TO CRYING
FIT TO BUST
AND THE MINUTE THE WORDS WERE OUT OF HIS MOUTH SOMEBODY OVER IN THE
CROWD STRUCK UP THE DOXOLOJER AND EVERYBODY JOINED IN WITH ALL THEIR
MIGHT AND IT JUST WARMED YOU UP AND MADE YOU FEEL AS GOOD AS CHURCH
LETTING OUT
MUSIC IS A GOOD THING AND AFTER ALL THAT SOUL BUTTER AND
HOGWASH I NEVER SEE IT FRESHEN UP THINGS SO AND SOUND SO HONEST AND
BULLY
THEN THE KING BEGINS TO WORK HIS JAW AGAIN AND SAYS HOW HIM AND HIS
NIECES WOULD BE GLAD IF A FEW OF THE MAIN PRINCIPAL FRIENDS OF THE
FAMILY WOULD TAKE SUPPER HERE WITH THEM THIS EVENING AND HELP SET UP
WITH THE ASHES OF THE DISEASED AND SAYS IF HIS POOR BROTHER LAYING
YONDER COULD SPEAK HE KNOWS WHO HE WOULD NAME FOR THEY WAS NAMES THAT
WAS VERY DEAR TO HIM AND MENTIONED OFTEN IN HIS LETTERS AND SO HE WILL
NAME THE SAME TO WIT AS FOLLOWS VIZZ REV
MR
HOBSON AND DEACON
LOT HOVEY AND MR
BEN RUCKER AND ABNER SHACKLEFORD AND LEVI BELL AND
DR
ROBINSON AND THEIR WIVES AND THE WIDOW BARTLEY
REV
HOBSON AND DR
ROBINSON WAS DOWN TO THE END OF THE TOWN A HUNTING
TOGETHER THAT IS I MEAN THE DOCTOR WAS SHIPPING A SICK MAN TO T'OTHER
WORLD AND THE PREACHER WAS PINTING HIM RIGHT
LAWYER BELL WAS AWAY UP
TO LOUISVILLE ON BUSINESS
BUT THE REST WAS ON HAND AND SO THEY ALL
COME AND SHOOK HANDS WITH THE KING AND THANKED HIM AND TALKED TO HIM
AND THEN THEY SHOOK HANDS WITH THE DUKE AND DIDN'T SAY NOTHING BUT JUST
KEPT A SMILING AND BOBBING THEIR HEADS LIKE A PASSEL OF SAPHEADS WHILST
HE MADE ALL SORTS OF SIGNS WITH HIS HANDS AND SAID GOO GOO GOO GOO GOO
ALL THE TIME LIKE A BABY THAT CAN'T TALK
SO THE KING HE BLATTERED ALONG AND MANAGED TO INQUIRE ABOUT PRETTY
MUCH EVERYBODY AND DOG IN TOWN BY HIS NAME AND MENTIONED ALL SORTS
OF LITTLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED ONE TIME OR ANOTHER IN THE TOWN OR TO
GEORGE'S FAMILY OR TO PETER
AND HE ALWAYS LET ON THAT PETER WROTE HIM
THE THINGS BUT THAT WAS A LIE HE GOT EVERY BLESSED ONE OF THEM OUT OF
THAT YOUNG FLATHEAD THAT WE CANOED UP TO THE STEAMBOAT
THEN MARY JANE SHE FETCHED THE LETTER HER FATHER LEFT BEHIND AND THE
KING HE READ IT OUT LOUD AND CRIED OVER IT
IT GIVE THE DWELLING HOUSE
AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS GOLD TO THE GIRLS AND IT GIVE THE TANYARD
WHICH WAS DOING A GOOD BUSINESS ALONG WITH SOME OTHER HOUSES AND
LAND WORTH ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GOLD
TO HARVEY AND WILLIAM AND TOLD WHERE THE SIX THOUSAND CASH WAS HID DOWN
CELLAR
SO THESE TWO FRAUDS SAID THEY'D GO AND FETCH IT UP AND HAVE
EVERYTHING SQUARE AND ABOVE BOARD AND TOLD ME TO COME WITH A CANDLE
WE SHUT THE CELLAR DOOR BEHIND US AND WHEN THEY FOUND THE BAG
THEY SPILT IT OUT ON THE FLOOR AND IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT ALL THEM
YALLER BOYS
MY THE WAY THE KING'S EYES DID SHINE HE SLAPS THE DUKE
ON THE SHOULDER AND SAYS
OH THIS AIN'T BULLY NOR NOTH'N OH NO I RECKON NOT WHY
BULLY IT BEATS THE NONESUCH DON'T IT
THE DUKE ALLOWED IT DID
THEY PAWED THE YALLER BOYS AND SIFTED THEM
THROUGH THEIR FINGERS AND LET THEM JINGLE DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND THE
KING SAYS

REPRESENTATIVES OF FURRIN HEIRS THAT'S GOT LEFT IS THE LINE FOR YOU AND

WAY
MOST EVERYBODY WOULD A BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE PILE AND TOOK IT ON
TRUST BUT NO THEY MUST COUNT IT
SO THEY COUNTS IT AND IT COMES OUT
FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS SHORT
SAYS THE KING
DERN HIM I WONDER WHAT HE DONE WITH THAT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN
DOLLARS
THEY WORRIED OVER THAT AWHILE AND RANSACKED ALL AROUND FOR IT
THEN
THE DUKE SAYS
WELL HE WAS A PRETTY SICK MAN AND LIKELY HE MADE A MISTAKE I RECKON
THAT'S THE WAY OF IT
THE BEST WAY'S TO LET IT GO AND KEEP STILL ABOUT
IT
WE CAN SPARE IT
OH SHUCKS YES WE CAN SPARE IT

WHEN WE GOT UP STAIRS EVERYBODY GETHERED AROUND THE TABLE AND THE KING
HE COUNTED IT AND STACKED IT UP THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN A PILE TWENTY
ELEGANT LITTLE PILES
EVERYBODY LOOKED HUNGRY AT IT AND LICKED THEIR
CHOPS
THEN THEY RAKED IT INTO THE BAG AGAIN AND I SEE THE KING BEGIN
TO SWELL HIMSELF UP FOR ANOTHER SPEECH
HE SAYS
FRIENDS ALL MY POOR BROTHER THAT LAYS YONDER HAS DONE GENEROUS BY
THEM THAT'S LEFT BEHIND IN THE VALE OF SORRERS

LEATHER HEADED A WHILE THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SEEMS TO CATCH HIS

ABOUT IT
HERE MARY JANE SUSAN JOANNER TAKE THE MONEY TAKE IT

MARY JANE SHE WENT FOR HIM SUSAN AND THE HARE LIP WENT FOR THE

COMFORTABLE AND GLAD

WHY I THOUGHT HE'D BE IN THE PULPIT
ROT HIM I FORGOT HE WAS A PREACHER
I SEE I WAS UP A STUMP AGAIN SO I
PLAYED ANOTHER CHICKEN BONE AND GOT ANOTHER THINK
THEN I SAYS
BLAME IT DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE AIN'T BUT ONE PREACHER TO A CHURCH
WHY WHAT DO THEY WANT WITH MORE
WHAT TO PREACH BEFORE A KING I NEVER DID SEE SUCH A GIRL AS YOU

HOW IS
SERVANTS TREATED IN ENGLAND DO THEY TREAT 'EM BETTER 'N WE TREAT OUR
NIGGERS
NO A SERVANT AIN'T NOBODY THERE
THEY TREAT THEM WORSE THAN DOGS
DON'T THEY GIVE 'EM HOLIDAYS THE WAY WE DO CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR'S
WEEK AND FOURTH OF JULY
OH JUST LISTEN A BODY COULD TELL YOU HAIN'T EVER BEEN TO ENGLAND
BY THAT
WHY HARE L WHY JOANNA THEY NEVER SEE A HOLIDAY FROM YEAR'S
END TO YEAR'S END NEVER GO TO THE CIRCUS NOR THEATER NOR NIGGER
SHOWS NOR NOWHERES
NOR CHURCH
NOR CHURCH
BUT YOU ALWAYS WENT TO CHURCH
WELL I WAS GONE UP AGAIN
I FORGOT I WAS THE OLD MAN'S SERVANT
BUT
NEXT MINUTE I WHIRLED IN ON A KIND OF AN EXPLANATION HOW A VALLEY WAS
DIFFERENT FROM A COMMON SERVANT AND HAD TO GO TO CHURCH WHETHER HE
WANTED TO OR NOT AND SET WITH THE FAMILY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING THE
LAW
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT PRETTY GOOD AND WHEN I GOT DONE I SEE SHE
WARN'T SATISFIED
SHE SAYS
HONEST INJUN NOW HAIN'T YOU BEEN TELLING ME A LOT OF LIES
HONEST INJUN SAYS I
NONE OF IT AT ALL
NONE OF IT AT ALL
NOT A LIE IN IT SAYS I
LAY YOUR HAND ON THIS BOOK AND SAY IT
I SEE IT WARN'T NOTHING BUT A DICTIONARY SO I LAID MY HAND ON IT AND
SAID IT
SO THEN SHE LOOKED A LITTLE BETTER SATISFIED AND SAYS
WELL THEN I'LL BELIEVE SOME OF IT BUT I HOPE TO GRACIOUS IF I'LL
BELIEVE THE REST
WHAT IS IT YOU WON'T BELIEVE JOE SAYS MARY JANE STEPPING IN WITH
SUSAN BEHIND HER
IT AIN'T RIGHT NOR KIND FOR YOU TO TALK SO TO HIM
AND HIM A STRANGER AND SO FAR FROM HIS PEOPLE
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE
TREATED SO
THAT'S ALWAYS YOUR WAY MAIM ALWAYS SAILING IN TO HELP SOMEBODY BEFORE
THEY'RE HURT
I HAIN'T DONE NOTHING TO HIM
HE'S TOLD SOME STRETCHERS
I RECKON AND I SAID I WOULDN'T SWALLOW IT ALL AND THAT'S EVERY BIT
AND GRAIN I DID SAY
I RECKON HE CAN STAND A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT
CAN'T HE
I DON'T CARE WHETHER 'TWAS LITTLE OR WHETHER 'TWAS BIG HE'S HERE IN
OUR HOUSE AND A STRANGER AND IT WASN'T GOOD OF YOU TO SAY IT
IF YOU
WAS IN HIS PLACE IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL ASHAMED AND SO YOU OUGHTN'T TO
SAY A THING TO ANOTHER PERSON THAT WILL MAKE THEM FEEL ASHAMED
WHY MAM HE SAID
IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHAT HE SAID THAT AIN'T THE THING
THE
THING IS FOR YOU TO TREAT HIM KIND AND NOT BE SAYING THINGS TO MAKE
HIM REMEMBER HE AIN'T IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND AMONGST HIS OWN FOLKS
I SAYS TO MYSELF THIS IS A GIRL THAT I'M LETTING THAT OLD REPTILE ROB
HER OF HER MONEY
THEN SUSAN SHE WALTZED IN AND IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME SHE DID GIVE
HARE LIP HARK FROM THE TOMB
SAYS I TO MYSELF AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I'M LETTING HIM ROB HER
OF HER MONEY
THEN MARY JANE SHE TOOK ANOTHER INNING AND WENT IN SWEET AND LOVELY
AGAIN WHICH WAS HER WAY BUT WHEN SHE GOT DONE THERE WARN'T HARDLY
ANYTHING LEFT O' POOR HARE LIP
SO SHE HOLLERED
ALL RIGHT THEN SAYS THE OTHER GIRLS YOU JUST ASK HIS PARDON
SHE DONE IT TOO AND SHE DONE IT BEAUTIFUL
SHE DONE IT SO BEAUTIFUL
IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR AND I WISHED I COULD TELL HER A THOUSAND LIES SO
SHE COULD DO IT AGAIN
I SAYS TO MYSELF THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT I'M LETTING HIM ROB HER OF
HER MONEY
AND WHEN SHE GOT THROUGH THEY ALL JEST LAID THEIRSELVES
OUT TO MAKE ME FEEL AT HOME AND KNOW I WAS AMONGST FRIENDS
I FELT SO
ORNERY AND LOW DOWN AND MEAN THAT I SAYS TO MYSELF MY MIND'S MADE UP
I'LL HIVE THAT MONEY FOR THEM OR BUST
SO THEN I LIT OUT FOR BED I SAID MEANING SOME TIME OR ANOTHER
WHEN
I GOT BY MYSELF I WENT TO THINKING THE THING OVER
I SAYS TO MYSELF
SHALL I GO TO THAT DOCTOR PRIVATE AND BLOW ON THESE FRAUDS NO THAT
WON'T DO
HE MIGHT TELL WHO TOLD HIM THEN THE KING AND THE DUKE WOULD
MAKE IT WARM FOR ME
SHALL I GO PRIVATE AND TELL MARY JANE NO I
DASN'T DO IT
HER FACE WOULD GIVE THEM A HINT SURE THEY'VE GOT THE
MONEY AND THEY'D SLIDE RIGHT OUT AND GET AWAY WITH IT
IF SHE WAS TO
FETCH IN HELP I'D GET MIXED UP IN THE BUSINESS BEFORE IT WAS DONE WITH
I JUDGE
NO THERE AIN'T NO GOOD WAY BUT ONE
I GOT TO STEAL THAT
MONEY SOMEHOW AND I GOT TO STEAL IT SOME WAY THAT THEY WON'T SUSPICION
THAT I DONE IT
THEY'VE GOT A GOOD THING HERE AND THEY AIN'T A GOING
TO LEAVE TILL THEY'VE PLAYED THIS FAMILY AND THIS TOWN FOR ALL THEY'RE
WORTH SO I'LL FIND A CHANCE TIME ENOUGH
I'LL STEAL IT AND HIDE IT AND
BY AND BY WHEN I'M AWAY DOWN THE RIVER I'LL WRITE A LETTER AND TELL
MARY JANE WHERE IT'S HID
BUT I BETTER HIVE IT TONIGHT IF I CAN
BECAUSE THE DOCTOR MAYBE HASN'T LET UP AS MUCH AS HE LETS ON HE HAS HE
MIGHT SCARE THEM OUT OF HERE YET
SO THINKS I I'LL GO AND SEARCH THEM ROOMS
UPSTAIRS THE HALL WAS
DARK BUT I FOUND THE DUKE'S ROOM AND STARTED TO PAW AROUND IT WITH
MY HANDS BUT I RECOLLECTED IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH LIKE THE KING TO LET
ANYBODY ELSE TAKE CARE OF THAT MONEY BUT HIS OWN SELF SO THEN I WENT TO
HIS ROOM AND BEGUN TO PAW AROUND THERE
BUT I SEE I COULDN'T DO NOTHING
WITHOUT A CANDLE AND I DASN'T LIGHT ONE OF COURSE
SO I JUDGED I'D
GOT TO DO THE OTHER THING LAY FOR THEM AND EAVESDROP
ABOUT THAT TIME
I HEARS THEIR FOOTSTEPS COMING AND WAS GOING TO SKIP UNDER THE BED I
REACHED FOR IT BUT IT WASN'T WHERE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BUT I TOUCHED
THE CURTAIN THAT HID MARY JANE'S FROCKS SO I JUMPED IN BEHIND THAT AND
SNUGGLED IN AMONGST THE GOWNS AND STOOD THERE PERFECTLY STILL
THEY COME IN AND SHUT THE DOOR AND THE FIRST THING THE DUKE DONE WAS TO
GET DOWN AND LOOK UNDER THE BED
THEN I WAS GLAD I HADN'T FOUND THE BED
WHEN I WANTED IT
AND YET YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF NATURAL TO HIDE UNDER
THE BED WHEN YOU ARE UP TO ANYTHING PRIVATE
THEY SETS DOWN THEN AND
THE KING SAYS
WELL WHAT IS IT AND CUT IT MIDDLIN' SHORT BECAUSE IT'S BETTER FOR
US TO BE DOWN THERE A WHOOPIN' UP THE MOURNIN' THAN UP HERE GIVIN' 'EM A
CHANCE TO TALK US OVER
WELL THIS IS IT CAPET
I AIN'T EASY I AIN'T COMFORTABLE
THAT
DOCTOR LAYS ON MY MIND
I WANTED TO KNOW YOUR PLANS
I'VE GOT A
NOTION AND I THINK IT'S A SOUND ONE
WHAT IS IT DUKE
THAT WE BETTER GLIDE OUT OF THIS BEFORE THREE IN THE MORNING AND CLIP
IT DOWN THE RIVER WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT
SPECIALLY SEEING WE GOT IT SO
EASY GIVEN BACK TO US FLUNG AT OUR HEADS AS YOU MAY SAY WHEN OF
COURSE WE ALLOWED TO HAVE TO STEAL IT BACK
I'M FOR KNOCKING OFF AND
LIGHTING OUT
THAT MADE ME FEEL PRETTY BAD
ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO AGO IT WOULD A BEEN
A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT NOW IT MADE ME FEEL BAD AND DISAPPOINTED THE
KING RIPS OUT AND SAYS
WHAT AND NOT SELL OUT THE REST O' THE PROPERTY MARCH OFF LIKE
A PASSEL OF FOOLS AND LEAVE EIGHT OR NINE THOUS'N' DOLLARS' WORTH O'
PROPERTY LAYIN' AROUND JEST SUFFERIN' TO BE SCOOPED IN AND ALL GOOD
SALABLE STUFF TOO
THE DUKE HE GRUMBLED SAID THE BAG OF GOLD WAS ENOUGH AND HE DIDN'T
WANT TO GO NO DEEPER DIDN'T WANT TO ROB A LOT OF ORPHANS OF EVERYTHING
THEY HAD
WHY HOW YOU TALK SAYS THE KING
WE SHA'N'T ROB 'EM OF NOTHING AT
ALL BUT JEST THIS MONEY
THE PEOPLE THAT BUYS THE PROPERTY IS THE
SUFF'RERS BECAUSE AS SOON 'S IT'S FOUND OUT 'AT WE DIDN'T OWN IT WHICH
WON'T BE LONG AFTER WE'VE SLID THE SALE WON'T BE VALID AND IT 'LL ALL
GO BACK TO THE ESTATE
THESE YER ORPHANS 'LL GIT THEIR HOUSE BACK AGIN
AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THEM THEY'RE YOUNG AND SPRY AND K'N EASY
EARN A LIVIN'
THEY AIN'T A GOIN TO SUFFER
WHY JEST THINK THERE'S
THOUS'N'S AND THOUS'N'S THAT AIN'T NIGH SO WELL OFF
BLESS YOU THEY
AIN'T GOT NOTH'N' TO COMPLAIN OF
WELL THE KING HE TALKED HIM BLIND SO AT LAST HE GIVE IN AND SAID ALL
RIGHT BUT SAID HE BELIEVED IT WAS BLAMED FOOLISHNESS TO STAY AND THAT
DOCTOR HANGING OVER THEM
BUT THE KING SAYS
CUSS THE DOCTOR WHAT DO WE K'YER FOR HIM HAIN'T WE GOT ALL THE
FOOLS IN TOWN ON OUR SIDE AND AIN'T THAT A BIG ENOUGH MAJORITY IN ANY
TOWN
SO THEY GOT READY TO GO DOWN STAIRS AGAIN
THE DUKE SAYS
I DON'T THINK WE PUT THAT MONEY IN A GOOD PLACE
THAT CHEERED ME UP
I'D BEGUN TO THINK I WARN'T GOING TO GET A HINT OF
NO KIND TO HELP ME
THE KING SAYS
WHY
BECAUSE MARY JANE 'LL BE IN MOURNING FROM THIS OUT AND FIRST YOU KNOW
THE NIGGER THAT DOES UP THE ROOMS WILL GET AN ORDER TO BOX THESE DUDS
UP AND PUT 'EM AWAY AND DO YOU RECKON A NIGGER CAN RUN ACROSS MONEY AND
NOT BORROW SOME OF IT
YOUR HEAD'S LEVEL AGIN DUKE SAYS THE KING AND HE COMES A FUMBLING
UNDER THE CURTAIN TWO OR THREE FOOT FROM WHERE I WAS
I STUCK TIGHT TO
THE WALL AND KEPT MIGHTY STILL THOUGH QUIVERY AND I WONDERED WHAT THEM
FELLOWS WOULD SAY TO ME IF THEY CATCHED ME AND I TRIED TO THINK WHAT
I'D BETTER DO IF THEY DID CATCH ME
BUT THE KING HE GOT THE BAG BEFORE
I COULD THINK MORE THAN ABOUT A HALF A THOUGHT AND HE NEVER SUSPICIONED
I WAS AROUND
THEY TOOK AND SHOVED THE BAG THROUGH A RIP IN THE STRAW
TICK THAT WAS UNDER THE FEATHER BED AND CRAMMED IT IN A FOOT OR TWO
AMONGST THE STRAW AND SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE A NIGGER ONLY
MAKES UP THE FEATHER BED AND DON'T TURN OVER THE STRAW TICK ONLY ABOUT
TWICE A YEAR AND SO IT WARN'T IN NO DANGER OF GETTING STOLE NOW
BUT I KNOWED BETTER
I HAD IT OUT OF THERE BEFORE THEY WAS HALF WAY
DOWN STAIRS
I GROPED ALONG UP TO MY CUBBY AND HID IT THERE TILL I
COULD GET A CHANCE TO DO BETTER
I JUDGED I BETTER HIDE IT OUTSIDE
OF THE HOUSE SOMEWHERES BECAUSE IF THEY MISSED IT THEY WOULD GIVE THE
HOUSE A GOOD RANSACKING I KNOWED THAT VERY WELL
THEN I TURNED IN
WITH MY CLOTHES ALL ON BUT I COULDN'T A GONE TO SLEEP IF I'D A WANTED
TO I WAS IN SUCH A SWEAT TO GET THROUGH WITH THE BUSINESS
BY AND BY I
HEARD THE KING AND THE DUKE COME UP SO I ROLLED OFF MY PALLET AND LAID
WITH MY CHIN AT THE TOP OF MY LADDER AND WAITED TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN
BUT NOTHING DID
SO I HELD ON TILL ALL THE LATE SOUNDS HAD QUIT AND THE EARLY ONES HADN'T
BEGUN YET AND THEN I SLIPPED DOWN THE LADDER
CHAPTER XXVII
I CREPT TO THEIR DOORS AND LISTENED THEY WAS SNORING
SO I TIPTOED
ALONG AND GOT DOWN STAIRS ALL RIGHT
THERE WARN'T A SOUND ANYWHERES
I PEEPED THROUGH A CRACK OF THE DINING ROOM DOOR AND SEE THE MEN THAT
WAS WATCHING THE CORPSE ALL SOUND ASLEEP ON THEIR CHAIRS
THE DOOR
WAS OPEN INTO THE PARLOR WHERE THE CORPSE WAS LAYING AND THERE WAS A
CANDLE IN BOTH ROOMS
I PASSED ALONG AND THE PARLOR DOOR WAS OPEN BUT
I SEE THERE WARN'T NOBODY IN THERE BUT THE REMAINDERS OF PETER SO I
SHOVED ON BY BUT THE FRONT DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THE KEY WASN'T THERE
JUST THEN I HEARD SOMEBODY COMING DOWN THE STAIRS BACK BEHIND ME
I
RUN IN THE PARLOR AND TOOK A SWIFT LOOK AROUND AND THE ONLY PLACE I
SEE TO HIDE THE BAG WAS IN THE COFFIN
THE LID WAS SHOVED ALONG ABOUT
A FOOT SHOWING THE DEAD MAN'S FACE DOWN IN THERE WITH A WET CLOTH OVER
IT AND HIS SHROUD ON
I TUCKED THE MONEY BAG IN UNDER THE LID JUST
DOWN BEYOND WHERE HIS HANDS WAS CROSSED WHICH MADE ME CREEP THEY WAS
SO COLD AND THEN I RUN BACK ACROSS THE ROOM AND IN BEHIND THE DOOR
THE PERSON COMING WAS MARY JANE
SHE WENT TO THE COFFIN VERY SOFT AND
KNEELED DOWN AND LOOKED IN THEN SHE PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF AND I SEE
SHE BEGUN TO CRY THOUGH I COULDN'T HEAR HER AND HER BACK WAS TO ME
I
SLID OUT AND AS I PASSED THE DINING ROOM I THOUGHT I'D MAKE SURE THEM
WATCHERS HADN'T SEEN ME SO I LOOKED THROUGH THE CRACK AND EVERYTHING
WAS ALL RIGHT
THEY HADN'T STIRRED
I SLIPPED UP TO BED FEELING RUTHER BLUE ON ACCOUNTS OF THE THING
PLAYING OUT THAT WAY AFTER I HAD TOOK SO MUCH TROUBLE AND RUN SO MUCH
RESK ABOUT IT
SAYS I IF IT COULD STAY WHERE IT IS ALL RIGHT BECAUSE
WHEN WE GET DOWN THE RIVER A HUNDRED MILE OR TWO I COULD WRITE BACK TO
MARY JANE AND SHE COULD DIG HIM UP AGAIN AND GET IT BUT THAT AIN'T THE
THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS THE
MONEY 'LL BE FOUND WHEN THEY COME TO SCREW ON THE LID
THEN THE KING
'LL GET IT AGAIN AND IT 'LL BE A LONG DAY BEFORE HE GIVES ANYBODY
ANOTHER CHANCE TO SMOUCH IT FROM HIM
OF COURSE I WANTED TO SLIDE
DOWN AND GET IT OUT OF THERE BUT I DASN'T TRY IT
EVERY MINUTE IT WAS
GETTING EARLIER NOW AND PRETTY SOON SOME OF THEM WATCHERS WOULD BEGIN
TO STIR AND I MIGHT GET CATCHED CATCHED WITH SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MY
HANDS THAT NOBODY HADN'T HIRED ME TO TAKE CARE OF
I DON'T WISH TO BE
MIXED UP IN NO SUCH BUSINESS AS THAT I SAYS TO MYSELF
WHEN I GOT DOWN STAIRS IN THE MORNING THE PARLOR WAS SHUT UP AND THE
WATCHERS WAS GONE
THERE WARN'T NOBODY AROUND BUT THE FAMILY AND THE
WIDOW BARTLEY AND OUR TRIBE
I WATCHED THEIR FACES TO SEE IF ANYTHING
HAD BEEN HAPPENING BUT I COULDN'T TELL
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THE UNDERTAKER COME WITH HIS MAN AND THEY
SET THE COFFIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ON A COUPLE OF CHAIRS AND THEN
SET ALL OUR CHAIRS IN ROWS AND BORROWED MORE FROM THE NEIGHBORS TILL
THE HALL AND THE PARLOR AND THE DINING ROOM WAS FULL
I SEE THE COFFIN
LID WAS THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE BUT I DASN'T GO TO LOOK IN UNDER IT WITH
FOLKS AROUND
THEN THE PEOPLE BEGUN TO FLOCK IN AND THE BEATS AND THE GIRLS TOOK
SEATS IN THE FRONT ROW AT THE HEAD OF THE COFFIN AND FOR A HALF AN HOUR
THE PEOPLE FILED AROUND SLOW IN SINGLE RANK AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE
DEAD MAN'S FACE A MINUTE AND SOME DROPPED IN A TEAR AND IT WAS
ALL VERY STILL AND SOLEMN ONLY THE GIRLS AND THE BEATS HOLDING
HANDKERCHIEFS TO THEIR EYES AND KEEPING THEIR HEADS BENT AND SOBBING A
LITTLE
THERE WARN'T NO OTHER SOUND BUT THE SCRAPING OF THE FEET ON
THE FLOOR AND BLOWING NOSES BECAUSE PEOPLE ALWAYS BLOWS THEM MORE AT A
FUNERAL THAN THEY DO AT OTHER PLACES EXCEPT CHURCH
WHEN THE PLACE WAS PACKED FULL THE UNDERTAKER HE SLID AROUND IN HIS
BLACK GLOVES WITH HIS SOFTY SOOTHERING WAYS PUTTING ON THE LAST
TOUCHES AND GETTING PEOPLE AND THINGS ALL SHIP SHAPE AND COMFORTABLE
AND MAKING NO MORE SOUND THAN A CAT
HE NEVER SPOKE HE MOVED PEOPLE
AROUND HE SQUEEZED IN LATE ONES HE OPENED UP PASSAGEWAYS AND DONE
IT WITH NODS AND SIGNS WITH HIS HANDS
THEN HE TOOK HIS PLACE OVER
AGAINST THE WALL
HE WAS THE SOFTEST GLIDINGEST STEALTHIEST MAN I EVER
SEE AND THERE WARN'T NO MORE SMILE TO HIM THAN THERE IS TO A HAM
THEY HAD BORROWED A MELODEUM A SICK ONE AND WHEN EVERYTHING WAS READY
A YOUNG WOMAN SET DOWN AND WORKED IT AND IT WAS PRETTY SKREEKY AND
COLICKY AND EVERYBODY JOINED IN AND SUNG AND PETER WAS THE ONLY ONE
THAT HAD A GOOD THING ACCORDING TO MY NOTION
THEN THE REVEREND HOBSON
OPENED UP SLOW AND SOLEMN AND BEGUN TO TALK AND STRAIGHT OFF THE MOST
OUTRAGEOUS ROW BUSTED OUT IN THE CELLAR A BODY EVER HEARD IT WAS ONLY
ONE DOG BUT HE MADE A MOST POWERFUL RACKET AND HE KEPT IT UP RIGHT
ALONG THE PARSON HE HAD TO STAND THERE OVER THE COFFIN AND WAIT YOU
COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK
IT WAS RIGHT DOWN AWKWARD AND NOBODY
DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO
BUT PRETTY SOON THEY SEE THAT
LONG LEGGED UNDERTAKER MAKE A SIGN TO THE PREACHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY
DON'T YOU WORRY JUST DEPEND ON ME THEN HE STOOPED DOWN AND BEGUN
TO GLIDE ALONG THE WALL JUST HIS SHOULDERS SHOWING OVER THE PEOPLE'S
HEADS
SO HE GLIDED ALONG AND THE POWWOW AND RACKET GETTING MORE AND
MORE OUTRAGEOUS ALL THE TIME AND AT LAST WHEN HE HAD GONE AROUND TWO
SIDES OF THE ROOM HE DISAPPEARS DOWN CELLAR
THEN IN ABOUT TWO SECONDS
WE HEARD A WHACK AND THE DOG HE FINISHED UP WITH A MOST AMAZING HOWL OR
TWO AND THEN EVERYTHING WAS DEAD STILL AND THE PARSON BEGUN HIS SOLEMN
TALK WHERE HE LEFT OFF
IN A MINUTE OR TWO HERE COMES THIS UNDERTAKER'S
BACK AND SHOULDERS GLIDING ALONG THE WALL AGAIN AND SO HE GLIDED AND
GLIDED AROUND THREE SIDES OF THE ROOM AND THEN ROSE UP AND SHADED HIS
MOUTH WITH HIS HANDS AND STRETCHED HIS NECK OUT TOWARDS THE PREACHER
OVER THE PEOPLE'S HEADS AND SAYS IN A KIND OF A COARSE WHISPER HE
HAD A RAT THEN HE DROOPED DOWN AND GLIDED ALONG THE WALL AGAIN TO
HIS PLACE
YOU COULD SEE IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION TO THE PEOPLE
BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY WANTED TO KNOW
A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT DON'T
COST NOTHING AND IT'S JUST THE LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKES A MAN TO BE
LOOKED UP TO AND LIKED
THERE WARN'T NO MORE POPULAR MAN IN TOWN THAN
WHAT THAT UNDERTAKER WAS
WELL THE FUNERAL SERMON WAS VERY GOOD BUT PISON LONG AND TIRESOME AND
THEN THE KING HE SHOVED IN AND GOT OFF SOME OF HIS USUAL RUBBAGE AND
AT LAST THE JOB WAS THROUGH AND THE UNDERTAKER BEGUN TO SNEAK UP ON THE
COFFIN WITH HIS SCREW DRIVER
I WAS IN A SWEAT THEN AND WATCHED HIM
PRETTY KEEN
BUT HE NEVER MEDDLED AT ALL JUST SLID THE LID ALONG AS
SOFT AS MUSH AND SCREWED IT DOWN TIGHT AND FAST
SO THERE I WAS I
DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THE MONEY WAS IN THERE OR NOT
SO SAYS I S'POSE
SOMEBODY HAS HOGGED THAT BAG ON THE SLY NOW HOW DO I KNOW WHETHER
TO WRITE TO MARY JANE OR NOT S'POSE SHE DUG HIM UP AND DIDN'T FIND
NOTHING WHAT WOULD SHE THINK OF ME BLAME IT I SAYS I MIGHT GET
HUNTED UP AND JAILED I'D BETTER LAY LOW AND KEEP DARK AND NOT WRITE AT
ALL THE THING'S AWFUL MIXED NOW TRYING TO BETTER IT I'VE WORSENED IT
A HUNDRED TIMES AND I WISH TO GOODNESS I'D JUST LET IT ALONE DAD FETCH
THE WHOLE BUSINESS
THEY BURIED HIM AND WE COME BACK HOME AND I WENT TO WATCHING FACES
AGAIN I COULDN'T HELP IT AND I COULDN'T REST EASY
BUT NOTHING COME OF
IT THE FACES DIDN'T TELL ME NOTHING
THE KING HE VISITED AROUND IN THE EVENING AND SWEETENED EVERYBODY UP
AND MADE HIMSELF EVER SO FRIENDLY AND HE GIVE OUT THE IDEA THAT HIS
CONGREGATION OVER IN ENGLAND WOULD BE IN A SWEAT ABOUT HIM SO HE MUST
HURRY AND SETTLE UP THE ESTATE RIGHT AWAY AND LEAVE FOR HOME
HE WAS
VERY SORRY HE WAS SO PUSHED AND SO WAS EVERYBODY THEY WISHED HE COULD
STAY LONGER BUT THEY SAID THEY COULD SEE IT COULDN'T BE DONE
AND HE
SAID OF COURSE HIM AND WILLIAM WOULD TAKE THE GIRLS HOME WITH THEM AND
THAT PLEASED EVERYBODY TOO BECAUSE THEN THE GIRLS WOULD BE WELL FIXED
AND AMONGST THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND IT PLEASED THE GIRLS TOO TICKLED
THEM SO THEY CLEAN FORGOT THEY EVER HAD A TROUBLE IN THE WORLD AND TOLD
HIM TO SELL OUT AS QUICK AS HE WANTED TO THEY WOULD BE READY
THEM
POOR THINGS WAS THAT GLAD AND HAPPY IT MADE MY HEART ACHE TO SEE THEM
GETTING FOOLED AND LIED TO SO BUT I DIDN'T SEE NO SAFE WAY FOR ME TO
CHIP IN AND CHANGE THE GENERAL TUNE
WELL BLAMED IF THE KING DIDN'T BILL THE HOUSE AND THE NIGGERS AND ALL
THE PROPERTY FOR AUCTION STRAIGHT OFF SALE TWO DAYS AFTER THE FUNERAL
BUT ANYBODY COULD BUY PRIVATE BEFOREHAND IF THEY WANTED TO
SO THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL ALONG ABOUT NOON TIME THE GIRLS' JOY
GOT THE FIRST JOLT
A COUPLE OF NIGGER TRADERS COME ALONG AND THE KING
SOLD THEM THE NIGGERS REASONABLE FOR THREE DAY DRAFTS AS THEY CALLED
IT AND AWAY THEY WENT THE TWO SONS UP THE RIVER TO MEMPHIS AND THEIR
MOTHER DOWN THE RIVER TO ORLEANS
I THOUGHT THEM POOR GIRLS AND THEM
NIGGERS WOULD BREAK THEIR HEARTS FOR GRIEF THEY CRIED AROUND EACH
OTHER AND TOOK ON SO IT MOST MADE ME DOWN SICK TO SEE IT
THE GIRLS
SAID THEY HADN'T EVER DREAMED OF SEEING THE FAMILY SEPARATED OR SOLD
AWAY FROM THE TOWN
I CAN'T EVER GET IT OUT OF MY MEMORY THE SIGHT OF
THEM POOR MISERABLE GIRLS AND NIGGERS HANGING AROUND EACH OTHER'S NECKS
AND CRYING AND I RECKON I COULDN'T A STOOD IT ALL BUT WOULD A HAD
TO BUST OUT AND TELL ON OUR GANG IF I HADN'T KNOWED THE SALE WARN'T NO
ACCOUNT AND THE NIGGERS WOULD BE BACK HOME IN A WEEK OR TWO
THE THING MADE A BIG STIR IN THE TOWN TOO AND A GOOD MANY COME OUT
FLATFOOTED AND SAID IT WAS SCANDALOUS TO SEPARATE THE MOTHER AND THE
CHILDREN THAT WAY
IT INJURED THE FRAUDS SOME BUT THE OLD FOOL HE
BULLED RIGHT ALONG SPITE OF ALL THE DUKE COULD SAY OR DO AND I TELL
YOU THE DUKE WAS POWERFUL UNEASY
NEXT DAY WAS AUCTION DAY
ABOUT BROAD DAY IN THE MORNING THE KING AND
THE DUKE COME UP IN THE GARRET AND WOKE ME UP AND I SEE BY THEIR LOOK
THAT THERE WAS TROUBLE
THE KING SAYS
WAS YOU IN MY ROOM NIGHT BEFORE LAST
NO YOUR MAJESTY WHICH WAS THE WAY I ALWAYS CALLED HIM WHEN NOBODY BUT
OUR GANG WARN'T AROUND
WAS YOU IN THERE YISTERDAY ER LAST NIGHT
NO YOUR MAJESTY
HONOR BRIGHT NOW NO LIES
HONOR BRIGHT YOUR MAJESTY I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH
I HAIN'T BEEN
A NEAR YOUR ROOM SINCE MISS MARY JANE TOOK YOU AND THE DUKE AND SHOWED
IT TO YOU
THE DUKE SAYS
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYBODY ELSE GO IN THERE
NO YOUR GRACE NOT AS I REMEMBER I BELIEVE
STOP AND THINK
I STUDIED AWHILE AND SEE MY CHANCE THEN I SAYS
WELL I SEE THE NIGGERS GO IN THERE SEVERAL TIMES
BOTH OF THEM GAVE A LITTLE JUMP AND LOOKED LIKE THEY HADN'T EVER
EXPECTED IT AND THEN LIKE THEY HAD
THEN THE DUKE SAYS
WHAT ALL OF THEM
NO LEASTWAYS NOT ALL AT ONCE THAT IS I DON'T THINK I EVER SEE THEM
ALL COME OUT AT ONCE BUT JUST ONE TIME
HELLO WHEN WAS THAT
IT WAS THE DAY WE HAD THE FUNERAL
IN THE MORNING
IT WARN'T EARLY
BECAUSE I OVERSLEPT
I WAS JUST STARTING DOWN THE LADDER AND I SEE
THEM
WELL GO ON GO ON WHAT DID THEY DO HOW'D THEY ACT
THEY DIDN'T DO NOTHING
AND THEY DIDN'T ACT ANYWAY MUCH AS FUR AS I
SEE
THEY TIPTOED AWAY SO I SEEN EASY ENOUGH THAT THEY'D SHOVED IN
THERE TO DO UP YOUR MAJESTY'S ROOM OR SOMETHING S'POSING YOU WAS UP
AND FOUND YOU WARN'T UP AND SO THEY WAS HOPING TO SLIDE OUT OF THE
WAY OF TROUBLE WITHOUT WAKING YOU UP IF THEY HADN'T ALREADY WAKED YOU
UP
GREAT GUNS THIS IS A GO SAYS THE KING AND BOTH OF THEM LOOKED
PRETTY SICK AND TOLERABLE SILLY
THEY STOOD THERE A THINKING AND
SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS A MINUTE AND THE DUKE HE BUST INTO A KIND OF A
LITTLE RASPY CHUCKLE AND SAYS
IT DOES BEAT ALL HOW NEAT THE NIGGERS PLAYED THEIR HAND
THEY LET ON
TO BE SORRY THEY WAS GOING OUT OF THIS REGION AND I BELIEVED THEY
WAS SORRY AND SO DID YOU AND SO DID EVERYBODY
DON'T EVER TELL ME
ANY MORE THAT A NIGGER AIN'T GOT ANY HISTRIONIC TALENT
WHY THE WAY
THEY PLAYED THAT THING IT WOULD FOOL ANYBODY
IN MY OPINION THERE'S
A FORTUNE IN 'EM
IF I HAD CAPITAL AND A THEATER I WOULDN'T WANT A
BETTER LAY OUT THAN THAT AND HERE WE'VE GONE AND SOLD 'EM FOR A SONG
YES AND AIN'T PRIVILEGED TO SING THE SONG YET
SAY WHERE IS THAT
SONG THAT DRAFT
IN THE BANK FOR TO BE COLLECTED
WHERE WOULD IT BE
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN THANK GOODNESS
SAYS I KIND OF TIMID LIKE
IS SOMETHING GONE WRONG
THE KING WHIRLS ON ME AND RIPS OUT
NONE O' YOUR BUSINESS YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD SHET AND MIND Y'R OWN
AFFAIRS IF YOU GOT ANY
LONG AS YOU'RE IN THIS TOWN DON'T YOU FORGIT
THAT YOU HEAR THEN HE SAYS TO THE DUKE WE GOT TO JEST SWALLER IT
AND SAY NOTH'N' MUM'S THE WORD FOR US
AS THEY WAS STARTING DOWN THE LADDER THE DUKE HE CHUCKLES AGAIN AND
SAYS
QUICK SALES AND SMALL PROFITS IT'S A GOOD BUSINESS YES
THE KING SNARLS AROUND ON HIM AND SAYS
I WAS TRYING TO DO FOR THE BEST IN SELLIN' 'EM OUT SO QUICK
IF THE
PROFITS HAS TURNED OUT TO BE NONE LACKIN' CONSIDABLE AND NONE TO
CARRY IS IT MY FAULT ANY MORE'N IT'S YOURN
WELL THEY'D BE IN THIS HOUSE YET AND WE WOULDN'T IF I COULD A GOT
MY ADVICE LISTENED TO
THE KING SASSED BACK AS MUCH AS WAS SAFE FOR HIM AND THEN SWAPPED
AROUND AND LIT INTO ME AGAIN
HE GIVE ME DOWN THE BANKS FOR NOT
COMING AND TELLING HIM I SEE THE NIGGERS COME OUT OF HIS ROOM ACTING
THAT WAY SAID ANY FOOL WOULD A KNOWED SOMETHING WAS UP
AND THEN
WALTZED IN AND CUSSED HIMSELF AWHILE AND SAID IT ALL COME OF HIM NOT
LAYING LATE AND TAKING HIS NATURAL REST THAT MORNING AND HE'D BE
BLAMED IF HE'D EVER DO IT AGAIN
SO THEY WENT OFF A JAWING AND I FELT
DREADFUL GLAD I'D WORKED IT ALL OFF ON TO THE NIGGERS AND YET HADN'T
DONE THE NIGGERS NO HARM BY IT
CHAPTER XXVIII
BY AND BY IT WAS GETTING UP TIME
SO I COME DOWN THE LADDER AND STARTED
FOR DOWN STAIRS BUT AS I COME TO THE GIRLS' ROOM THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND
I SEE MARY JANE SETTING BY HER OLD HAIR TRUNK WHICH WAS OPEN AND SHE'D
BEEN PACKING THINGS IN IT GETTING READY TO GO TO ENGLAND
BUT SHE
HAD STOPPED NOW WITH A FOLDED GOWN IN HER LAP AND HAD HER FACE IN HER
HANDS CRYING
I FELT AWFUL BAD TO SEE IT OF COURSE ANYBODY WOULD
I
WENT IN THERE AND SAYS
MISS MARY JANE YOU CAN'T A BEAR TO SEE PEOPLE IN TROUBLE AND I
CAN'T MOST ALWAYS
TELL ME ABOUT IT
SO SHE DONE IT
AND IT WAS THE NIGGERS I JUST EXPECTED IT
SHE SAID
THE BEAUTIFUL TRIP TO ENGLAND WAS MOST ABOUT SPOILED FOR HER SHE DIDN'T
KNOW HOW SHE WAS EVER GOING TO BE HAPPY THERE KNOWING THE MOTHER AND
THE CHILDREN WARN'T EVER GOING TO SEE EACH OTHER NO MORE AND THEN BUSTED
OUT BITTERER THAN EVER AND FLUNG UP HER HANDS AND SAYS
OH DEAR DEAR TO THINK THEY AIN'T EVER GOING TO SEE EACH OTHER ANY
MORE
BUT THEY WILL AND INSIDE OF TWO WEEKS AND I KNOW IT SAYS I
LAWS IT WAS OUT BEFORE I COULD THINK AND BEFORE I COULD BUDGE SHE
THROWS HER ARMS AROUND MY NECK AND TOLD ME TO SAY IT AGAIN SAY IT
AGAIN SAY IT AGAIN
I SEE I HAD SPOKE TOO SUDDEN AND SAID TOO MUCH AND WAS IN A CLOSE
PLACE
I ASKED HER TO LET ME THINK A MINUTE AND SHE SET THERE VERY
IMPATIENT AND EXCITED AND HANDSOME BUT LOOKING KIND OF HAPPY AND
EASED UP LIKE A PERSON THAT'S HAD A TOOTH PULLED OUT
SO I WENT TO
STUDYING IT OUT
I SAYS TO MYSELF I RECKON A BODY THAT UPS AND TELLS
THE TRUTH WHEN HE IS IN A TIGHT PLACE IS TAKING CONSIDERABLE MANY RESKS
THOUGH I AIN'T HAD NO EXPERIENCE AND CAN'T SAY FOR CERTAIN BUT IT
LOOKS SO TO ME ANYWAY AND YET HERE'S A CASE WHERE I'M BLEST IF IT
DON'T LOOK TO ME LIKE THE TRUTH IS BETTER AND ACTULY SAFER THAN A LIE
I MUST LAY IT BY IN MY MIND AND THINK IT OVER SOME TIME OR OTHER IT'S
SO KIND OF STRANGE AND UNREGULAR
I NEVER SEE NOTHING LIKE IT
WELL I
SAYS TO MYSELF AT LAST I'M A GOING TO CHANCE IT I'LL UP AND TELL THE
TRUTH THIS TIME THOUGH IT DOES SEEM MOST LIKE SETTING DOWN ON A KAG OF
POWDER AND TOUCHING IT OFF JUST TO SEE WHERE YOU'LL GO TO
THEN I SAYS

LAYS OVER THEM ALL
I HAIN'T EVER SEEN HER SINCE THAT TIME THAT I SEE
HER GO OUT OF THAT DOOR NO I HAIN'T EVER SEEN HER SINCE BUT I RECKON

CHAPTER XXIX
THEY WAS FETCHING A VERY NICE LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN ALONG AND A
NICE LOOKING YOUNGER ONE WITH HIS RIGHT ARM IN A SLING
AND MY SOULS
HOW THE PEOPLE YELLED AND LAUGHED AND KEPT IT UP
BUT I DIDN'T SEE NO
JOKE ABOUT IT AND I JUDGED IT WOULD STRAIN THE DUKE AND THE KING SOME
TO SEE ANY
I RECKONED THEY'D TURN PALE
BUT NO NARY A PALE DID
THEY TURN
THE DUKE HE NEVER LET ON HE SUSPICIONED WHAT WAS UP BUT
JUST WENT A GOO GOOING AROUND HAPPY AND SATISFIED LIKE A JUG THAT'S
GOOGLING OUT BUTTERMILK AND AS FOR THE KING HE JUST GAZED AND GAZED
DOWN SORROWFUL ON THEM NEW COMERS LIKE IT GIVE HIM THE STOMACH ACHE IN
HIS VERY HEART TO THINK THERE COULD BE SUCH FRAUDS AND RASCALS IN THE
WORLD
OH HE DONE IT ADMIRABLE
LOTS OF THE PRINCIPAL PEOPLE
GETHERED AROUND THE KING TO LET HIM SEE THEY WAS ON HIS SIDE
THAT OLD
GENTLEMAN THAT HAD JUST COME LOOKED ALL PUZZLED TO DEATH
PRETTY
SOON HE BEGUN TO SPEAK AND I SEE STRAIGHT OFF HE PRONOUNCED LIKE AN
ENGLISHMAN NOT THE KING'S WAY THOUGH THE KING'S WAS PRETTY GOOD FOR
AN IMITATION
I CAN'T GIVE THE OLD GENT'S WORDS NOR I CAN'T IMITATE
HIM BUT HE TURNED AROUND TO THE CROWD AND SAYS ABOUT LIKE THIS
THIS IS A SURPRISE TO ME WHICH I WASN'T LOOKING FOR AND I'LL
ACKNOWLEDGE CANDID AND FRANK I AIN'T VERY WELL FIXED TO MEET IT AND
ANSWER IT FOR MY BROTHER AND ME HAS HAD MISFORTUNES HE'S BROKE HIS
ARM AND OUR BAGGAGE GOT PUT OFF AT A TOWN ABOVE HERE LAST NIGHT IN THE
NIGHT BY A MISTAKE
I AM PETER WILKS' BROTHER HARVEY AND THIS IS HIS
BROTHER WILLIAM WHICH CAN'T HEAR NOR SPEAK AND CAN'T EVEN MAKE SIGNS TO
AMOUNT TO MUCH NOW'T HE'S ONLY GOT ONE HAND TO WORK THEM WITH
WE ARE
WHO WE SAY WE ARE AND IN A DAY OR TWO WHEN I GET THE BAGGAGE I CAN
PROVE IT
BUT UP TILL THEN I WON'T SAY NOTHING MORE BUT GO TO THE HOTEL
AND WAIT
SO HIM AND THE NEW DUMMY STARTED OFF AND THE KING HE LAUGHS AND
BLETHERS OUT
BROKE HIS ARM VERY LIKELY AIN'T IT AND VERY CONVENIENT TOO
FOR A FRAUD THAT'S GOT TO MAKE SIGNS AND AIN'T LEARNT HOW
LOST
THEIR BAGGAGE THAT'S MIGHTY GOOD AND MIGHTY INGENIOUS UNDER THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
SO HE LAUGHED AGAIN AND SO DID EVERYBODY ELSE EXCEPT THREE OR FOUR
OR MAYBE HALF A DOZEN
ONE OF THESE WAS THAT DOCTOR ANOTHER ONE WAS
A SHARP LOOKING GENTLEMAN WITH A CARPET BAG OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND
MADE OUT OF CARPET STUFF THAT HAD JUST COME OFF OF THE STEAMBOAT AND
WAS TALKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND GLANCING TOWARDS THE KING NOW AND
THEN AND NODDING THEIR HEADS IT WAS LEVI BELL THE LAWYER THAT WAS GONE
UP TO LOUISVILLE AND ANOTHER ONE WAS A BIG ROUGH HUSKY THAT COME ALONG
AND LISTENED TO ALL THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAID AND WAS LISTENING TO THE
KING NOW
AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE THIS HUSKY UP AND SAYS
SAY LOOKY HERE IF YOU ARE HARVEY WILKS WHEN'D YOU COME TO THIS
TOWN
THE DAY BEFORE THE FUNERAL FRIEND SAYS THE KING
BUT WHAT TIME O' DAY
IN THE EVENIN' 'BOUT AN HOUR ER TWO BEFORE SUNDOWN
HOW'D YOU COME
I COME DOWN ON THE SUSAN POWELL FROM CINCINNATI
WELL THEN HOW'D YOU COME TO BE UP AT THE PINT IN THE MORNIN IN A
CANOE
I WARN'T UP AT THE PINT IN THE MORNIN'
IT'S A LIE
SEVERAL OF THEM JUMPED FOR HIM AND BEGGED HIM NOT TO TALK THAT WAY TO AN
OLD MAN AND A PREACHER
PREACHER BE HANGED HE'S A FRAUD AND A LIAR
HE WAS UP AT THE PINT
THAT MORNIN'
I LIVE UP THERE DON'T I WELL I WAS UP THERE AND
HE WAS UP THERE
I SEE HIM THERE
HE COME IN A CANOE ALONG WITH TIM
COLLINS AND A BOY
THE DOCTOR HE UP AND SAYS
WOULD YOU KNOW THE BOY AGAIN IF YOU WAS TO SEE HIM HINES
I RECKON I WOULD BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHY YONDER HE IS NOW
I KNOW
HIM PERFECTLY EASY
IT WAS ME HE POINTED AT
THE DOCTOR SAYS
NEIGHBORS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE NEW COUPLE IS FRAUDS OR NOT BUT IF
THESE TWO AIN'T FRAUDS I AM AN IDIOT THAT'S ALL
I THINK IT'S OUR
DUTY TO SEE THAT THEY DON'T GET AWAY FROM HERE TILL WE'VE LOOKED INTO
THIS THING
COME ALONG HINES COME ALONG THE REST OF YOU
WE'LL TAKE
THESE FELLOWS TO THE TAVERN AND AFFRONT THEM WITH T'OTHER COUPLE AND I
RECKON WE'LL FIND OUT SOMETHING BEFORE WE GET THROUGH
IT WAS NUTS FOR THE CROWD THOUGH MAYBE NOT FOR THE KING'S FRIENDS SO
WE ALL STARTED
IT WAS ABOUT SUNDOWN
THE DOCTOR HE LED ME ALONG BY
THE HAND AND WAS PLENTY KIND ENOUGH BUT HE NEVER LET GO MY HAND
WE ALL GOT IN A BIG ROOM IN THE HOTEL AND LIT UP SOME CANDLES AND
FETCHED IN THE NEW COUPLE
FIRST THE DOCTOR SAYS
I DON'T WISH TO BE TOO HARD ON THESE TWO MEN BUT I THINK THEY'RE
FRAUDS AND THEY MAY HAVE COMPLICES THAT WE DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
IF THEY HAVE WON'T THE COMPLICES GET AWAY WITH THAT BAG OF GOLD PETER
WILKS LEFT IT AIN'T UNLIKELY
IF THESE MEN AIN'T FRAUDS THEY WON'T
OBJECT TO SENDING FOR THAT MONEY AND LETTING US KEEP IT TILL THEY PROVE
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT AIN'T THAT SO
EVERYBODY AGREED TO THAT
SO I JUDGED THEY HAD OUR GANG IN A PRETTY
TIGHT PLACE RIGHT AT THE OUTSTART
BUT THE KING HE ONLY LOOKED
SORROWFUL AND SAYS
GENTLEMEN I WISH THE MONEY WAS THERE FOR I AIN'T GOT NO DISPOSITION
TO THROW ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF A FAIR OPEN OUT AND OUT INVESTIGATION
O' THIS MISABLE BUSINESS BUT ALAS THE MONEY AIN'T THERE YOU K'N SEND
AND SEE IF YOU WANT TO
WHERE IS IT THEN
WELL WHEN MY NIECE GIVE IT TO ME TO KEEP FOR HER I TOOK AND HID IT
INSIDE O' THE STRAW TICK O' MY BED NOT WISHIN' TO BANK IT FOR THE FEW
DAYS WE'D BE HERE AND CONSIDERIN' THE BED A SAFE PLACE WE NOT BEIN'
USED TO NIGGERS AND SUPPOS'N' 'EM HONEST LIKE SERVANTS IN ENGLAND
THE NIGGERS STOLE IT THE VERY NEXT MORNIN' AFTER I HAD WENT DOWN
STAIRS AND WHEN I SOLD 'EM I HADN'T MISSED THE MONEY YIT SO THEY GOT
CLEAN AWAY WITH IT
MY SERVANT HERE K'N TELL YOU 'BOUT IT GENTLEMEN
THE DOCTOR AND SEVERAL SAID SHUCKS AND I SEE NOBODY DIDN'T ALTOGETHER
BELIEVE HIM
ONE MAN ASKED ME IF I SEE THE NIGGERS STEAL IT
I SAID
NO BUT I SEE THEM SNEAKING OUT OF THE ROOM AND HUSTLING AWAY AND I
NEVER THOUGHT NOTHING ONLY I RECKONED THEY WAS AFRAID THEY HAD WAKED UP
MY MASTER AND WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY BEFORE HE MADE TROUBLE WITH THEM
THAT WAS ALL THEY ASKED ME
THEN THE DOCTOR WHIRLS ON ME AND SAYS
ARE YOU ENGLISH TOO
I SAYS YES AND HIM AND SOME OTHERS LAUGHED AND SAID STUFF
WELL THEN THEY SAILED IN ON THE GENERAL INVESTIGATION AND THERE WE HAD
IT UP AND DOWN HOUR IN HOUR OUT AND NOBODY NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT
SUPPER NOR EVER SEEMED TO THINK ABOUT IT AND SO THEY KEPT IT UP AND
KEPT IT UP AND IT WAS THE WORST MIXED UP THING YOU EVER SEE
THEY
MADE THE KING TELL HIS YARN AND THEY MADE THE OLD GENTLEMAN TELL HIS'N
AND ANYBODY BUT A LOT OF PREJUDICED CHUCKLEHEADS WOULD A SEEN THAT THE
OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SPINNING TRUTH AND T'OTHER ONE LIES
AND BY AND BY
THEY HAD ME UP TO TELL WHAT I KNOWED
THE KING HE GIVE ME A LEFT HANDED
LOOK OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE AND SO I KNOWED ENOUGH TO TALK ON THE
RIGHT SIDE
I BEGUN TO TELL ABOUT SHEFFIELD AND HOW WE LIVED THERE
AND ALL ABOUT THE ENGLISH WILKSES AND SO ON BUT I DIDN'T GET PRETTY
FUR TILL THE DOCTOR BEGUN TO LAUGH AND LEVI BELL THE LAWYER SAYS
SET DOWN MY BOY I WOULDN'T STRAIN MYSELF IF I WAS YOU
I RECKON
YOU AIN'T USED TO LYING IT DON'T SEEM TO COME HANDY WHAT YOU WANT IS
PRACTICE
YOU DO IT PRETTY AWKWARD
I DIDN'T CARE NOTHING FOR THE COMPLIMENT BUT I WAS GLAD TO BE LET OFF
ANYWAY
THE DOCTOR HE STARTED TO SAY SOMETHING AND TURNS AND SAYS
IF YOU'D BEEN IN TOWN AT FIRST LEVI BELL THE KING BROKE IN AND
REACHED OUT HIS HAND AND SAYS
WHY IS THIS MY POOR DEAD BROTHER'S OLD FRIEND THAT HE'S WROTE SO OFTEN
ABOUT
THE LAWYER AND HIM SHOOK HANDS AND THE LAWYER SMILED AND LOOKED
PLEASED AND THEY TALKED RIGHT ALONG AWHILE AND THEN GOT TO ONE SIDE
AND TALKED LOW AND AT LAST THE LAWYER SPEAKS UP AND SAYS
THAT 'LL FIX IT
I'LL TAKE THE ORDER AND SEND IT ALONG WITH YOUR
BROTHER'S AND THEN THEY'LL KNOW IT'S ALL RIGHT
SO THEY GOT SOME PAPER AND A PEN AND THE KING HE SET DOWN AND TWISTED
HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND CHAWED HIS TONGUE AND SCRAWLED OFF SOMETHING
AND THEN THEY GIVE THE PEN TO THE DUKE AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME THE
DUKE LOOKED SICK
BUT HE TOOK THE PEN AND WROTE
SO THEN THE LAWYER
TURNS TO THE NEW OLD GENTLEMAN AND SAYS
YOU AND YOUR BROTHER PLEASE WRITE A LINE OR TWO AND SIGN YOUR NAMES
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WROTE BUT NOBODY COULDN'T READ IT
THE LAWYER LOOKED
POWERFUL ASTONISHED AND SAYS
WELL IT BEATS ME AND SNAKED A LOT OF OLD LETTERS OUT OF HIS POCKET
AND EXAMINED THEM AND THEN EXAMINED THE OLD MAN'S WRITING AND THEN
THEM AGAIN AND THEN SAYS THESE OLD LETTERS IS FROM HARVEY WILKS
AND HERE'S THESE TWO HANDWRITINGS AND ANYBODY CAN SEE THEY DIDN'T
WRITE THEM THE KING AND THE DUKE LOOKED SOLD AND FOOLISH I TELL
YOU TO SEE HOW THE LAWYER HAD TOOK THEM IN AND HERE'S THIS OLD
GENTLEMAN'S HAND WRITING AND ANYBODY CAN TELL EASY ENOUGH HE DIDN'T
WRITE THEM FACT IS THE SCRATCHES HE MAKES AIN'T PROPERLY WRITING AT
ALL
NOW HERE'S SOME LETTERS FROM
THE NEW OLD GENTLEMAN SAYS
IF YOU PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN
NOBODY CAN READ MY HAND BUT MY BROTHER
THERE SO HE COPIES FOR ME
IT'S HIS HAND YOU'VE GOT THERE NOT MINE
WELL SAYS THE LAWYER THIS IS A STATE OF THINGS
I'VE GOT SOME
OF WILLIAM'S LETTERS TOO SO IF YOU'LL GET HIM TO WRITE A LINE OR SO WE
CAN COM
HE CAN'T WRITE WITH HIS LEFT HAND SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN
IF HE
COULD USE HIS RIGHT HAND YOU WOULD SEE THAT HE WROTE HIS OWN LETTERS
AND MINE TOO
LOOK AT BOTH PLEASE THEY'RE BY THE SAME HAND
THE LAWYER DONE IT AND SAYS
I BELIEVE IT'S SO AND IF IT AIN'T SO THERE'S A HEAP STRONGER
RESEMBLANCE THAN I'D NOTICED BEFORE ANYWAY
WELL WELL WELL I
THOUGHT WE WAS RIGHT ON THE TRACK OF A SOLUTION BUT IT'S GONE TO GRASS
PARTLY
BUT ANYWAY ONE THING IS PROVED THESE TWO AIN'T EITHER OF 'EM
WILKSES AND HE WAGGED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE KING AND THE DUKE
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MULEHEADED OLD FOOL WOULDN'T GIVE IN
THEN INDEED HE WOULDN'T
SAID IT WARN'T NO FAIR TEST
SAID HIS
BROTHER WILLIAM WAS THE CUSSEDEST JOKER IN THE WORLD AND HADN'T TRIED
TO WRITE HE SEE WILLIAM WAS GOING TO PLAY ONE OF HIS JOKES THE MINUTE
HE PUT THE PEN TO PAPER
AND SO HE WARMED UP AND WENT WARBLING AND
WARBLING RIGHT ALONG TILL HE WAS ACTULY BEGINNING TO BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS
SAYING HIMSELF BUT PRETTY SOON THE NEW GENTLEMAN BROKE IN AND SAYS
I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING
IS THERE ANYBODY HERE THAT HELPED TO LAY
OUT MY BR HELPED TO LAY OUT THE LATE PETER WILKS FOR BURYING
YES SAYS SOMEBODY ME AND AB TURNER DONE IT
WE'RE BOTH HERE
THEN THE OLD MAN TURNS TOWARDS THE KING AND SAYS
PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN CAN TELL ME WHAT WAS TATTOOED ON HIS BREAST
BLAMED IF THE KING DIDN'T HAVE TO BRACE UP MIGHTY QUICK OR HE'D A
SQUSHED DOWN LIKE A BLUFF BANK THAT THE RIVER HAS CUT UNDER IT TOOK
HIM SO SUDDEN AND MIND YOU IT WAS A THING THAT WAS CALCULATED TO MAKE
MOST ANYBODY SQUSH TO GET FETCHED SUCH A SOLID ONE AS THAT WITHOUT ANY
NOTICE BECAUSE HOW WAS HE GOING TO KNOW WHAT WAS TATTOOED ON THE MAN
HE WHITENED A LITTLE HE COULDN'T HELP IT AND IT WAS MIGHTY STILL IN
THERE AND EVERYBODY BENDING A LITTLE FORWARDS AND GAZING AT HIM
SAYS

THE NEW OLD GENTLEMAN TURNS BRISK TOWARDS AB TURNER AND HIS PARD AND
HIS EYE LIGHTS UP LIKE HE JUDGED HE'D GOT THE KING THIS TIME AND
SAYS

WILKS' BREAST
BOTH OF THEM SPOKE UP AND SAYS

YOUNG AND A W WITH DASHES BETWEEN THEM SO P B W AND HE MARKED
THEM THAT WAY ON A PIECE OF PAPER
COME AIN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAW
BOTH OF THEM SPOKE UP AGAIN AND SAYS

WELL EVERYBODY WAS IN A STATE OF MIND NOW AND THEY SINGS OUT
THE WHOLE BILIN OF 'M 'S FRAUDS LE'S DUCK 'EM LE'S DROWN 'EM
LE'S RIDE 'EM ON A RAIL AND EVERYBODY WAS WHOOPING AT ONCE AND THERE
WAS A RATTLING POWWOW
BUT THE LAWYER HE JUMPS ON THE TABLE AND YELLS
AND SAYS
GENTLEMEN GENTLE MEN HEAR ME JUST A WORD JUST A SINGLE WORD IF YOU
PLEASE THERE'S ONE WAY YET LET'S GO AND DIG UP THE CORPSE AND LOOK

HOORAY THEY ALL SHOUTED AND WAS STARTING RIGHT OFF BUT THE LAWYER
AND THE DOCTOR SUNG OUT
HOLD ON HOLD ON COLLAR ALL THESE FOUR MEN AND THE BOY AND FETCH
THEM ALONG TOO
WE'LL DO IT THEY ALL SHOUTED AND IF WE DON'T FIND THEM MARKS WE'LL
LYNCH THE WHOLE GANG
I WAS SCARED NOW I TELL YOU
BUT THERE WARN'T NO GETTING AWAY YOU
KNOW
THEY GRIPPED US ALL AND MARCHED US RIGHT ALONG STRAIGHT FOR THE
GRAVEYARD WHICH WAS A MILE AND A HALF DOWN THE RIVER AND THE WHOLE
TOWN AT OUR HEELS FOR WE MADE NOISE ENOUGH AND IT WAS ONLY NINE IN THE
EVENING
AS WE WENT BY OUR HOUSE I WISHED I HADN'T SENT MARY JANE OUT OF TOWN
BECAUSE NOW IF I COULD TIP HER THE WINK SHE'D LIGHT OUT AND SAVE ME AND
BLOW ON OUR DEAD BEATS
WELL WE SWARMED ALONG DOWN THE RIVER ROAD JUST CARRYING ON LIKE
WILDCATS AND TO MAKE IT MORE SCARY THE SKY WAS DARKING UP AND THE
LIGHTNING BEGINNING TO WINK AND FLITTER AND THE WIND TO SHIVER AMONGST
THE LEAVES
THIS WAS THE MOST AWFUL TROUBLE AND MOST DANGERSOME I EVER
WAS IN AND I WAS KINDER STUNNED EVERYTHING WAS GOING SO DIFFERENT FROM
WHAT I HAD ALLOWED FOR STEAD OF BEING FIXED SO I COULD TAKE MY OWN TIME
IF I WANTED TO AND SEE ALL THE FUN AND HAVE MARY JANE AT MY BACK TO
SAVE ME AND SET ME FREE WHEN THE CLOSE FIT COME HERE WAS NOTHING IN THE
WORLD BETWIXT ME AND SUDDEN DEATH BUT JUST THEM TATTOO MARKS
IF THEY
DIDN'T FIND THEM
I COULDN'T BEAR TO THINK ABOUT IT AND YET SOMEHOW I COULDN'T THINK
ABOUT NOTHING ELSE
IT GOT DARKER AND DARKER AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
TIME TO GIVE THE CROWD THE SLIP BUT THAT BIG HUSKY HAD ME BY THE
WRIST HINES AND A BODY MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GIVE GOLIAR THE SLIP
HE
DRAGGED ME RIGHT ALONG HE WAS SO EXCITED AND I HAD TO RUN TO KEEP UP
WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY SWARMED INTO THE GRAVEYARD AND WASHED OVER IT
LIKE AN OVERFLOW
AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THE GRAVE THEY FOUND THEY HAD
ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY SHOVELS AS THEY WANTED BUT NOBODY HADN'T
THOUGHT TO FETCH A LANTERN
BUT THEY SAILED INTO DIGGING ANYWAY BY THE
FLICKER OF THE LIGHTNING AND SENT A MAN TO THE NEAREST HOUSE A HALF A
MILE OFF TO BORROW ONE
SO THEY DUG AND DUG LIKE EVERYTHING AND IT GOT AWFUL DARK AND THE RAIN
STARTED AND THE WIND SWISHED AND SWUSHED ALONG AND THE LIGHTNING COME
BRISKER AND BRISKER AND THE THUNDER BOOMED BUT THEM PEOPLE NEVER TOOK
NO NOTICE OF IT THEY WAS SO FULL OF THIS BUSINESS AND ONE MINUTE
YOU COULD SEE EVERYTHING AND EVERY FACE IN THAT BIG CROWD AND THE
SHOVELFULS OF DIRT SAILING UP OUT OF THE GRAVE AND THE NEXT SECOND THE
DARK WIPED IT ALL OUT AND YOU COULDN'T SEE NOTHING AT ALL
AT LAST THEY GOT OUT THE COFFIN AND BEGUN TO UNSCREW THE LID AND THEN
SUCH ANOTHER CROWDING AND SHOULDERING AND SHOVING AS THERE WAS TO
SCROUGE IN AND GET A SIGHT YOU NEVER SEE AND IN THE DARK THAT WAY IT
WAS AWFUL
HINES HE HURT MY WRIST DREADFUL PULLING AND TUGGING SO
AND I RECKON HE CLEAN FORGOT I WAS IN THE WORLD HE WAS SO EXCITED AND
PANTING
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LIGHTNING LET GO A PERFECT SLUICE OF WHITE GLARE
AND SOMEBODY SINGS OUT
BY THE LIVING JINGO HERE'S THE BAG OF GOLD ON HIS BREAST
HINES LET OUT A WHOOP LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE AND DROPPED MY WRIST AND
GIVE A BIG SURGE TO BUST HIS WAY IN AND GET A LOOK AND THE WAY I LIT
OUT AND SHINNED FOR THE ROAD IN THE DARK THERE AIN'T NOBODY CAN TELL
I HAD THE ROAD ALL TO MYSELF AND I FAIRLY FLEW LEASTWAYS I HAD IT ALL
TO MYSELF EXCEPT THE SOLID DARK AND THE NOW AND THEN GLARES AND THE
BUZZING OF THE RAIN AND THE THRASHING OF THE WIND AND THE SPLITTING OF
THE THUNDER AND SURE AS YOU ARE BORN I DID CLIP IT ALONG
WHEN I STRUCK THE TOWN I SEE THERE WARN'T NOBODY OUT IN THE STORM SO
I NEVER HUNTED FOR NO BACK STREETS BUT HUMPED IT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE
MAIN ONE AND WHEN I BEGUN TO GET TOWARDS OUR HOUSE I AIMED MY EYE AND
SET IT
NO LIGHT THERE THE HOUSE ALL DARK WHICH MADE ME FEEL SORRY AND
DISAPPOINTED I DIDN'T KNOW WHY
BUT AT LAST JUST AS I WAS SAILING BY
FLASH COMES THE LIGHT IN MARY JANE'S WINDOW AND MY HEART SWELLED UP
SUDDEN LIKE TO BUST AND THE SAME SECOND THE HOUSE AND ALL WAS BEHIND
ME IN THE DARK AND WASN'T EVER GOING TO BE BEFORE ME NO MORE IN THIS
WORLD
SHE WAS THE BEST GIRL I EVER SEE AND HAD THE MOST SAND
THE MINUTE I WAS FAR ENOUGH ABOVE THE TOWN TO SEE I COULD MAKE THE
TOWHEAD I BEGUN TO LOOK SHARP FOR A BOAT TO BORROW AND THE FIRST
TIME THE LIGHTNING SHOWED ME ONE THAT WASN'T CHAINED I SNATCHED IT AND
SHOVED
IT WAS A CANOE AND WARN'T FASTENED WITH NOTHING BUT A ROPE
THE TOWHEAD WAS A RATTLING BIG DISTANCE OFF AWAY OUT THERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE RIVER BUT I DIDN'T LOSE NO TIME AND WHEN I STRUCK THE
RAFT AT LAST I WAS SO FAGGED I WOULD A JUST LAID DOWN TO BLOW AND GASP
IF I COULD AFFORDED IT
BUT I DIDN'T
AS I SPRUNG ABOARD I SUNG OUT
OUT WITH YOU JIM AND SET HER LOOSE GLORY BE TO GOODNESS WE'RE SHUT
OF THEM
JIM LIT OUT AND WAS A COMING FOR ME WITH BOTH ARMS SPREAD HE WAS SO
FULL OF JOY BUT WHEN I GLIMPSED HIM IN THE LIGHTNING MY HEART SHOT UP
IN MY MOUTH AND I WENT OVERBOARD BACKWARDS FOR I FORGOT HE WAS OLD KING
LEAR AND A DROWNDED A RAB ALL IN ONE AND IT MOST SCARED THE LIVERS AND
LIGHTS OUT OF ME
BUT JIM FISHED ME OUT AND WAS GOING TO HUG ME AND
BLESS ME AND SO ON HE WAS SO GLAD I WAS BACK AND WE WAS SHUT OF THE
KING AND THE DUKE BUT I SAYS
NOT NOW HAVE IT FOR BREAKFAST HAVE IT FOR BREAKFAST CUT LOOSE AND
LET HER SLIDE
SO IN TWO SECONDS AWAY WE WENT A SLIDING DOWN THE RIVER AND IT DID
SEEM SO GOOD TO BE FREE AGAIN AND ALL BY OURSELVES ON THE BIG RIVER AND
NOBODY TO BOTHER US
I HAD TO SKIP AROUND A BIT AND JUMP UP AND CRACK
MY HEELS A FEW TIMES I COULDN'T HELP IT BUT ABOUT THE THIRD CRACK
I NOTICED A SOUND THAT I KNOWED MIGHTY WELL AND HELD MY BREATH AND
LISTENED AND WAITED AND SURE ENOUGH WHEN THE NEXT FLASH BUSTED OUT
OVER THE WATER HERE THEY COME AND JUST A LAYING TO THEIR OARS AND
MAKING THEIR SKIFF HUM IT WAS THE KING AND THE DUKE
SO I WILTED RIGHT DOWN ON TO THE PLANKS THEN AND GIVE UP AND IT WAS
ALL I COULD DO TO KEEP FROM CRYING
CHAPTER XXX
WHEN THEY GOT ABOARD THE KING WENT FOR ME AND SHOOK ME BY THE COLLAR
AND SAYS
TRYIN' TO GIVE US THE SLIP WAS YE YOU PUP TIRED OF OUR COMPANY
HEY
I SAYS
NO YOUR MAJESTY WE WARN'T PLEASE DON'T YOUR MAJESTY
QUICK THEN AND TELL US WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA OR I'LL SHAKE THE
INSIDES OUT O' YOU
HONEST I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING JUST AS IT HAPPENED YOUR MAJESTY
THE MAN THAT HAD A HOLT OF ME WAS VERY GOOD TO ME AND KEPT SAYING HE
HAD A BOY ABOUT AS BIG AS ME THAT DIED LAST YEAR AND HE WAS SORRY
TO SEE A BOY IN SUCH A DANGEROUS FIX AND WHEN THEY WAS ALL TOOK BY
SURPRISE BY FINDING THE GOLD AND MADE A RUSH FOR THE COFFIN HE LETS GO
OF ME AND WHISPERS 'HEEL IT NOW OR THEY'LL HANG YE SURE AND I LIT
OUT
IT DIDN'T SEEM NO GOOD FOR ME TO STAY I COULDN'T DO NOTHING
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE HUNG IF I COULD GET AWAY
SO I NEVER STOPPED
RUNNING TILL I FOUND THE CANOE AND WHEN I GOT HERE I TOLD JIM TO HURRY
OR THEY'D CATCH ME AND HANG ME YET AND SAID I WAS AFEARD YOU AND THE
DUKE WASN'T ALIVE NOW AND I WAS AWFUL SORRY AND SO WAS JIM AND WAS
AWFUL GLAD WHEN WE SEE YOU COMING YOU MAY ASK JIM IF I DIDN'T
JIM SAID IT WAS SO AND THE KING TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP AND SAID OH
YES IT'S MIGHTY LIKELY AND SHOOK ME UP AGAIN AND SAID HE RECKONED
HE'D DROWND ME
BUT THE DUKE SAYS
LEGGO THE BOY YOU OLD IDIOT WOULD YOU A DONE ANY DIFFERENT DID
YOU INQUIRE AROUND FOR HIM WHEN YOU GOT LOOSE I DON'T REMEMBER IT
SO THE KING LET GO OF ME AND BEGUN TO CUSS THAT TOWN AND EVERYBODY IN
IT
BUT THE DUKE SAYS
YOU BETTER A BLAME' SIGHT GIVE YOURSELF A GOOD CUSSING FOR YOU'RE
THE ONE THAT'S ENTITLED TO IT MOST
YOU HAIN'T DONE A THING FROM THE
START THAT HAD ANY SENSE IN IT EXCEPT COMING OUT SO COOL AND CHEEKY
WITH THAT IMAGINARY BLUE ARROW MARK
THAT WAS BRIGHT IT WAS RIGHT
DOWN BULLY AND IT WAS THE THING THAT SAVED US
FOR IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR THAT THEY'D A JAILED US TILL THEM ENGLISHMEN'S BAGGAGE COME AND
THEN THE PENITENTIARY YOU BET BUT THAT TRICK TOOK 'EM TO THE
GRAVEYARD AND THE GOLD DONE US A STILL BIGGER KINDNESS FOR IF THE
EXCITED FOOLS HADN'T LET GO ALL HOLTS AND MADE THAT RUSH TO GET A
LOOK WE'D A SLEPT IN OUR CRAVATS TO NIGHT CRAVATS WARRANTED TO WEAR
TOO LONGER THAN WE'D NEED 'EM
THEY WAS STILL A MINUTE THINKING THEN THE KING SAYS KIND OF
ABSENT MINDED LIKE
MF AND WE RECKONED THE NIGGERS STOLE IT
THAT MADE ME SQUIRM
YES SAYS THE DUKE KINDER SLOW AND DELIBERATE AND SARCASTIC WE
DID
AFTER ABOUT A HALF A MINUTE THE KING DRAWLS OUT
LEASTWAYS I DID
THE DUKE SAYS THE SAME WAY
ON THE CONTRARY I DID
THE KING KIND OF RUFFLES UP AND SAYS
LOOKY HERE BILGEWATER WHAT'R YOU REFERRIN' TO
THE DUKE SAYS PRETTY BRISK
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT MAYBE YOU'LL LET ME ASK WHAT WAS YOU
REFERRING TO
SHUCKS SAYS THE KING VERY SARCASTIC BUT I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU WAS
ASLEEP AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WAS ABOUT
THE DUKE BRISTLES UP NOW AND SAYS
OH LET UP ON THIS CUSSED NONSENSE DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A BLAME' FOOL
DON'T YOU RECKON I KNOW WHO HID THAT MONEY IN THAT COFFIN
YES SIR I KNOW YOU DO KNOW BECAUSE YOU DONE IT YOURSELF
IT'S A LIE AND THE DUKE WENT FOR HIM
THE KING SINGS OUT
TAKE Y'R HANDS OFF LEGGO MY THROAT I TAKE IT ALL BACK
THE DUKE SAYS
WELL YOU JUST OWN UP FIRST THAT YOU DID HIDE THAT MONEY THERE
INTENDING TO GIVE ME THE SLIP ONE OF THESE DAYS AND COME BACK AND DIG
IT UP AND HAVE IT ALL TO YOURSELF
WAIT JEST A MINUTE DUKE ANSWER ME THIS ONE QUESTION HONEST AND FAIR
IF YOU DIDN'T PUT THE MONEY THERE SAY IT AND I'LL B'LIEVE YOU AND
TAKE BACK EVERYTHING I SAID
YOU OLD SCOUNDREL I DIDN'T AND YOU KNOW I DIDN'T
THERE NOW
WELL THEN I B'LIEVE YOU
BUT ANSWER ME ONLY JEST THIS ONE MORE NOW
DON'T GIT MAD DIDN'T YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR MIND TO HOOK THE MONEY AND
HIDE IT
THE DUKE NEVER SAID NOTHING FOR A LITTLE BIT THEN HE SAYS
WELL I DON'T CARE IF I DID I DIDN'T DO IT ANYWAY
BUT YOU NOT
ONLY HAD IT IN MIND TO DO IT BUT YOU DONE IT
I WISHT I NEVER DIE IF I DONE IT DUKE AND THAT'S HONEST
I WON'T SAY
I WARN'T GOIN' TO DO IT BECAUSE I WAS BUT YOU I MEAN SOMEBODY GOT IN
AHEAD O' ME
IT'S A LIE YOU DONE IT AND YOU GOT TO SAY YOU DONE IT OR
THE KING BEGAN TO GURGLE AND THEN HE GASPS OUT
'NOUGH I OWN UP
I WAS VERY GLAD TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT IT MADE ME FEEL MUCH MORE EASIER
THAN WHAT I WAS FEELING BEFORE
SO THE DUKE TOOK HIS HANDS OFF AND
SAYS
IF YOU EVER DENY IT AGAIN I'LL DROWN YOU
IT'S WELL FOR YOU TO SET
THERE AND BLUBBER LIKE A BABY IT'S FITTEN FOR YOU AFTER THE WAY
YOU'VE ACTED
I NEVER SEE SUCH AN OLD OSTRICH FOR WANTING TO GOBBLE
EVERYTHING AND I A TRUSTING YOU ALL THE TIME LIKE YOU WAS MY OWN
FATHER
YOU OUGHT TO BEEN ASHAMED OF YOURSELF TO STAND BY AND HEAR IT
SADDLED ON TO A LOT OF POOR NIGGERS AND YOU NEVER SAY A WORD FOR 'EM
IT MAKES ME FEEL RIDICULOUS TO THINK I WAS SOFT ENOUGH TO BELIEVE
THAT RUBBAGE
CUSS YOU I CAN SEE NOW WHY YOU WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MAKE
UP THE DEFFISIT YOU WANTED TO GET WHAT MONEY I'D GOT OUT OF THE NONESUCH
AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND SCOOP IT ALL
THE KING SAYS TIMID AND STILL A SNUFFLING
WHY DUKE IT WAS YOU THAT SAID MAKE UP THE DEFFISIT IT WARN'T ME
DRY UP I DON'T WANT TO HEAR NO MORE OUT OF YOU SAYS THE DUKE
AND
NOW YOU SEE WHAT YOU GOT BY IT
THEY'VE GOT ALL THEIR OWN MONEY BACK
AND ALL OF OURN BUT A SHEKEL OR TWO BESIDES
G'LONG TO BED AND
DON'T YOU DEFFERSIT ME NO MORE DEFFERSITS LONG 'S YOU LIVE
SO THE KING SNEAKED INTO THE WIGWAM AND TOOK TO HIS BOTTLE FOR COMFORT
AND BEFORE LONG THE DUKE TACKLED HIS BOTTLE AND SO IN ABOUT A HALF AN
HOUR THEY WAS AS THICK AS THIEVES AGAIN AND THE TIGHTER THEY GOT THE
LOVINGER THEY GOT AND WENT OFF A SNORING IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS
THEY
BOTH GOT POWERFUL MELLOW BUT I NOTICED THE KING DIDN'T GET MELLOW
ENOUGH TO FORGET TO REMEMBER TO NOT DENY ABOUT HIDING THE MONEY BAG
AGAIN
THAT MADE ME FEEL EASY AND SATISFIED
OF COURSE WHEN THEY GOT
TO SNORING WE HAD A LONG GABBLE AND I TOLD JIM EVERYTHING
CHAPTER XXXI
WE DASN'T STOP AGAIN AT ANY TOWN FOR DAYS AND DAYS KEPT RIGHT ALONG
DOWN THE RIVER
WE WAS DOWN SOUTH IN THE WARM WEATHER NOW AND A MIGHTY
LONG WAYS FROM HOME
WE BEGUN TO COME TO TREES WITH SPANISH MOSS ON
THEM HANGING DOWN FROM THE LIMBS LIKE LONG GRAY BEARDS
IT WAS THE
FIRST I EVER SEE IT GROWING AND IT MADE THE WOODS LOOK SOLEMN AND
DISMAL
SO NOW THE FRAUDS RECKONED THEY WAS OUT OF DANGER AND THEY
BEGUN TO WORK THE VILLAGES AGAIN
FIRST THEY DONE A LECTURE ON TEMPERANCE BUT THEY DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH
FOR THEM BOTH TO GET DRUNK ON
THEN IN ANOTHER VILLAGE THEY STARTED
A DANCING SCHOOL BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW NO MORE HOW TO DANCE THAN A
KANGAROO DOES SO THE FIRST PRANCE THEY MADE THE GENERAL PUBLIC JUMPED
IN AND PRANCED THEM OUT OF TOWN
ANOTHER TIME THEY TRIED TO GO AT
YELLOCUTION BUT THEY DIDN'T YELLOCUTE LONG TILL THE AUDIENCE GOT UP AND
GIVE THEM A SOLID GOOD CUSSING AND MADE THEM SKIP OUT
THEY TACKLED
MISSIONARYING AND MESMERIZING AND DOCTORING AND TELLING FORTUNES AND
A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING BUT THEY COULDN'T SEEM TO HAVE NO LUCK
SO AT
LAST THEY GOT JUST ABOUT DEAD BROKE AND LAID AROUND THE RAFT AS SHE
FLOATED ALONG THINKING AND THINKING AND NEVER SAYING NOTHING BY THE
HALF A DAY AT A TIME AND DREADFUL BLUE AND DESPERATE
AND AT LAST THEY TOOK A CHANGE AND BEGUN TO LAY THEIR HEADS TOGETHER IN
THE WIGWAM AND TALK LOW AND CONFIDENTIAL TWO OR THREE HOURS AT A TIME
JIM AND ME GOT UNEASY
WE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT
WE JUDGED THEY
WAS STUDYING UP SOME KIND OF WORSE DEVILTRY THAN EVER
WE TURNED IT
OVER AND OVER AND AT LAST WE MADE UP OUR MINDS THEY WAS GOING TO BREAK
INTO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE OR STORE OR WAS GOING INTO THE COUNTERFEIT MONEY
BUSINESS OR SOMETHING
SO THEN WE WAS PRETTY SCARED AND MADE UP AN
AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING IN THE WORLD TO DO WITH SUCH
ACTIONS AND IF WE EVER GOT THE LEAST SHOW WE WOULD GIVE THEM THE COLD
SHAKE AND CLEAR OUT AND LEAVE THEM BEHIND
WELL EARLY ONE MORNING WE
HID THE RAFT IN A GOOD SAFE PLACE ABOUT TWO MILE BELOW A LITTLE BIT OF
A SHABBY VILLAGE NAMED PIKESVILLE AND THE KING HE WENT ASHORE AND TOLD
US ALL TO STAY HID WHILST HE WENT UP TO TOWN AND SMELT AROUND TO SEE
IF ANYBODY HAD GOT ANY WIND OF THE ROYAL NONESUCH THERE YET
HOUSE TO
ROB YOU MEAN SAYS I TO MYSELF AND WHEN YOU GET THROUGH ROBBING IT
YOU'LL COME BACK HERE AND WONDER WHAT HAS BECOME OF ME AND JIM AND THE
RAFT AND YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT IN WONDERING AND HE SAID IF HE
WARN'T BACK BY MIDDAY THE DUKE AND ME WOULD KNOW IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND
WE WAS TO COME ALONG
SO WE STAYED WHERE WE WAS
THE DUKE HE FRETTED AND SWEATED AROUND AND
WAS IN A MIGHTY SOUR WAY
HE SCOLDED US FOR EVERYTHING AND WE COULDN'T
SEEM TO DO NOTHING RIGHT HE FOUND FAULT WITH EVERY LITTLE THING
SOMETHING WAS A BREWING SURE
I WAS GOOD AND GLAD WHEN MIDDAY COME
AND NO KING WE COULD HAVE A CHANGE ANYWAY AND MAYBE A CHANCE FOR THE
CHANGE ON TOP OF IT
SO ME AND THE DUKE WENT UP TO THE VILLAGE AND
HUNTED AROUND THERE FOR THE KING AND BY AND BY WE FOUND HIM IN THE
BACK ROOM OF A LITTLE LOW DOGGERY VERY TIGHT AND A LOT OF LOAFERS
BULLYRAGGING HIM FOR SPORT AND HE A CUSSING AND A THREATENING WITH ALL
HIS MIGHT AND SO TIGHT HE COULDN'T WALK AND COULDN'T DO NOTHING TO
THEM
THE DUKE HE BEGUN TO ABUSE HIM FOR AN OLD FOOL AND THE KING
BEGUN TO SASS BACK AND THE MINUTE THEY WAS FAIRLY AT IT I LIT OUT AND
SHOOK THE REEFS OUT OF MY HIND LEGS AND SPUN DOWN THE RIVER ROAD LIKE
A DEER FOR I SEE OUR CHANCE AND I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT WOULD BE A
LONG DAY BEFORE THEY EVER SEE ME AND JIM AGAIN
I GOT DOWN THERE ALL
OUT OF BREATH BUT LOADED UP WITH JOY AND SUNG OUT
SET HER LOOSE JIM WE'RE ALL RIGHT NOW
BUT THERE WARN'T NO ANSWER AND NOBODY COME OUT OF THE WIGWAM
JIM WAS
GONE I SET UP A SHOUT AND THEN ANOTHER AND THEN ANOTHER ONE AND RUN
THIS WAY AND THAT IN THE WOODS WHOOPING AND SCREECHING BUT IT WARN'T
NO USE OLD JIM WAS GONE
THEN I SET DOWN AND CRIED I COULDN'T HELP
IT
BUT I COULDN'T SET STILL LONG
PRETTY SOON I WENT OUT ON THE ROAD
TRYING TO THINK WHAT I BETTER DO AND I RUN ACROSS A BOY WALKING AND
ASKED HIM IF HE'D SEEN A STRANGE NIGGER DRESSED SO AND SO AND HE SAYS
YES
WHEREABOUTS SAYS I
DOWN TO SILAS PHELPS' PLACE TWO MILE BELOW HERE
HE'S A RUNAWAY
NIGGER AND THEY'VE GOT HIM
WAS YOU LOOKING FOR HIM
YOU BET I AIN'T I RUN ACROSS HIM IN THE WOODS ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO
AGO AND HE SAID IF I HOLLERED HE'D CUT MY LIVERS OUT AND TOLD ME TO LAY
DOWN AND STAY WHERE I WAS AND I DONE IT
BEEN THERE EVER SINCE AFEARD
TO COME OUT
WELL HE SAYS YOU NEEDN'T BE AFEARD NO MORE BECUZ THEY'VE GOT HIM
HE RUN OFF F'M DOWN SOUTH SOM'ERS
IT'S A GOOD JOB THEY GOT HIM
WELL I RECKON THERE'S TWO HUNDERD DOLLARS REWARD ON HIM
IT'S
LIKE PICKING UP MONEY OUT'N THE ROAD
YES IT IS AND I COULD A HAD IT IF I'D BEEN BIG ENOUGH I SEE HIM
FIRST
WHO NAILED HIM
IT WAS AN OLD FELLOW A STRANGER AND HE SOLD OUT HIS CHANCE IN HIM FOR
FORTY DOLLARS BECUZ HE'S GOT TO GO UP THE RIVER AND CAN'T WAIT
THINK
O' THAT NOW YOU BET I'D WAIT IF IT WAS SEVEN YEAR
THAT'S ME EVERY TIME SAYS I
BUT MAYBE HIS CHANCE AIN'T WORTH
NO MORE THAN THAT IF HE'LL SELL IT SO CHEAP
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
AIN'T STRAIGHT ABOUT IT
BUT IT IS THOUGH STRAIGHT AS A STRING
I SEE THE HANDBILL MYSELF
IT TELLS ALL ABOUT HIM TO A DOT PAINTS HIM LIKE A PICTURE AND TELLS
THE PLANTATION HE'S FRUM BELOW NEWR LEANS
NO SIRREE BOB THEY
AIN'T NO TROUBLE 'BOUT THAT SPECULATION YOU BET YOU
SAY GIMME A
CHAW TOBACKER WON'T YE
I DIDN'T HAVE NONE SO HE LEFT
I WENT TO THE RAFT AND SET DOWN IN THE
WIGWAM TO THINK
BUT I COULDN'T COME TO NOTHING
I THOUGHT TILL I WORE
MY HEAD SORE BUT I COULDN'T SEE NO WAY OUT OF THE TROUBLE
AFTER ALL
THIS LONG JOURNEY AND AFTER ALL WE'D DONE FOR THEM SCOUNDRELS HERE IT
WAS ALL COME TO NOTHING EVERYTHING ALL BUSTED UP AND RUINED BECAUSE
THEY COULD HAVE THE HEART TO SERVE JIM SUCH A TRICK AS THAT AND MAKE
HIM A SLAVE AGAIN ALL HIS LIFE AND AMONGST STRANGERS TOO FOR FORTY
DIRTY DOLLARS
ONCE I SAID TO MYSELF IT WOULD BE A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER FOR JIM TO
BE A SLAVE AT HOME WHERE HIS FAMILY WAS AS LONG AS HE'D GOT TO BE A
SLAVE AND SO I'D BETTER WRITE A LETTER TO TOM SAWYER AND TELL HIM TO
TELL MISS WATSON WHERE HE WAS
BUT I SOON GIVE UP THAT NOTION FOR TWO
THINGS SHE'D BE MAD AND DISGUSTED AT HIS RASCALITY AND UNGRATEFULNESS
FOR LEAVING HER AND SO SHE'D SELL HIM STRAIGHT DOWN THE RIVER AGAIN
AND IF SHE DIDN'T EVERYBODY NATURALLY DESPISES AN UNGRATEFUL NIGGER
AND THEY'D MAKE JIM FEEL IT ALL THE TIME AND SO HE'D FEEL ORNERY AND
DISGRACED
AND THEN THINK OF ME IT WOULD GET ALL AROUND THAT HUCK
FINN HELPED A NIGGER TO GET HIS FREEDOM AND IF I WAS EVER TO SEE
ANYBODY FROM THAT TOWN AGAIN I'D BE READY TO GET DOWN AND LICK HIS BOOTS
FOR SHAME
THAT'S JUST THE WAY A PERSON DOES A LOW DOWN THING AND
THEN HE DON'T WANT TO TAKE NO CONSEQUENCES OF IT
THINKS AS LONG AS HE
CAN HIDE IT IT AIN'T NO DISGRACE
THAT WAS MY FIX EXACTLY
THE MORE I
STUDIED ABOUT THIS THE MORE MY CONSCIENCE WENT TO GRINDING ME AND THE
MORE WICKED AND LOW DOWN AND ORNERY I GOT TO FEELING
AND AT LAST WHEN
IT HIT ME ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT HERE WAS THE PLAIN HAND OF PROVIDENCE
SLAPPING ME IN THE FACE AND LETTING ME KNOW MY WICKEDNESS WAS BEING
WATCHED ALL THE TIME FROM UP THERE IN HEAVEN WHILST I WAS STEALING A
POOR OLD WOMAN'S NIGGER THAT HADN'T EVER DONE ME NO HARM AND NOW WAS
SHOWING ME THERE'S ONE THAT'S ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT AND AIN'T A GOING
TO ALLOW NO SUCH MISERABLE DOINGS TO GO ONLY JUST SO FUR AND NO FURTHER
I MOST DROPPED IN MY TRACKS I WAS SO SCARED
WELL I TRIED THE BEST I
COULD TO KINDER SOFTEN IT UP SOMEHOW FOR MYSELF BY SAYING I WAS BRUNG
UP WICKED AND SO I WARN'T SO MUCH TO BLAME BUT SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME
KEPT SAYING THERE WAS THE SUNDAY SCHOOL YOU COULD A GONE TO IT AND
IF YOU'D A DONE IT THEY'D A LEARNT YOU THERE THAT PEOPLE THAT ACTS AS
I'D BEEN ACTING ABOUT THAT NIGGER GOES TO EVERLASTING FIRE
IT MADE ME SHIVER
AND I ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND TO PRAY AND SEE IF I
COULDN'T TRY TO QUIT BEING THE KIND OF A BOY I WAS AND BE BETTER
SO
I KNEELED DOWN
BUT THE WORDS WOULDN'T COME
WHY WOULDN'T THEY IT
WARN'T NO USE TO TRY AND HIDE IT FROM HIM
NOR FROM ME NEITHER
I
KNOWED VERY WELL WHY THEY WOULDN'T COME
IT WAS BECAUSE MY HEART WARN'T
RIGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WARN'T SQUARE IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS PLAYING
DOUBLE
I WAS LETTING ON TO GIVE UP SIN BUT AWAY INSIDE OF ME I WAS
HOLDING ON TO THE BIGGEST ONE OF ALL
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE MY MOUTH
SAY I WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND THE CLEAN THING AND GO AND WRITE
TO THAT NIGGER'S OWNER AND TELL WHERE HE WAS BUT DEEP DOWN IN ME I
KNOWED IT WAS A LIE AND HE KNOWED IT
YOU CAN'T PRAY A LIE I FOUND
THAT OUT
SO I WAS FULL OF TROUBLE FULL AS I COULD BE AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO
AT LAST I HAD AN IDEA AND I SAYS I'LL GO AND WRITE THE LETTER AND
THEN SEE IF I CAN PRAY
WHY IT WAS ASTONISHING THE WAY I FELT AS
LIGHT AS A FEATHER RIGHT STRAIGHT OFF AND MY TROUBLES ALL GONE
SO I
GOT A PIECE OF PAPER AND A PENCIL ALL GLAD AND EXCITED AND SET DOWN
AND WROTE
MISS WATSON YOUR RUNAWAY NIGGER JIM IS DOWN HERE TWO MILE BELOW
PIKESVILLE AND MR
PHELPS HAS GOT HIM AND HE WILL GIVE HIM UP FOR THE
REWARD IF YOU SEND
HUCK FINN
I FELT GOOD AND ALL WASHED CLEAN OF SIN FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER
FELT SO IN MY LIFE AND I KNOWED I COULD PRAY NOW
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT
STRAIGHT OFF BUT LAID THE PAPER DOWN AND SET THERE THINKING THINKING
HOW GOOD IT WAS ALL THIS HAPPENED SO AND HOW NEAR I COME TO BEING LOST
AND GOING TO HELL
AND WENT ON THINKING
AND GOT TO THINKING OVER OUR
TRIP DOWN THE RIVER AND I SEE JIM BEFORE ME ALL THE TIME IN THE DAY
AND IN THE NIGHT TIME SOMETIMES MOONLIGHT SOMETIMES STORMS AND WE
A FLOATING ALONG TALKING AND SINGING AND LAUGHING
BUT SOMEHOW I
COULDN'T SEEM TO STRIKE NO PLACES TO HARDEN ME AGAINST HIM BUT ONLY THE
OTHER KIND
I'D SEE HIM STANDING MY WATCH ON TOP OF HIS'N 'STEAD OF
CALLING ME SO I COULD GO ON SLEEPING AND SEE HIM HOW GLAD HE WAS WHEN
I COME BACK OUT OF THE FOG AND WHEN I COME TO HIM AGAIN IN THE SWAMP
UP THERE WHERE THE FEUD WAS AND SUCH LIKE TIMES AND WOULD ALWAYS CALL
ME HONEY AND PET ME AND DO EVERYTHING HE COULD THINK OF FOR ME AND HOW
GOOD HE ALWAYS WAS AND AT LAST I STRUCK THE TIME I SAVED HIM BY TELLING
THE MEN WE HAD SMALL POX ABOARD AND HE WAS SO GRATEFUL AND SAID I WAS
THE BEST FRIEND OLD JIM EVER HAD IN THE WORLD AND THE ONLY ONE HE'S
GOT NOW AND THEN I HAPPENED TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE THAT PAPER
IT WAS A CLOSE PLACE
I TOOK IT UP AND HELD IT IN MY HAND
I WAS
A TREMBLING BECAUSE I'D GOT TO DECIDE FOREVER BETWIXT TWO THINGS AND
I KNOWED IT
I STUDIED A MINUTE SORT OF HOLDING MY BREATH AND THEN
SAYS TO MYSELF
ALL RIGHT THEN I'LL GO TO HELL AND TORE IT UP
IT WAS AWFUL THOUGHTS AND AWFUL WORDS BUT THEY WAS SAID
AND I LET
THEM STAY SAID AND NEVER THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT REFORMING
I SHOVED THE
WHOLE THING OUT OF MY HEAD AND SAID I WOULD TAKE UP WICKEDNESS AGAIN
WHICH WAS IN MY LINE BEING BRUNG UP TO IT AND THE OTHER WARN'T
AND
FOR A STARTER I WOULD GO TO WORK AND STEAL JIM OUT OF SLAVERY AGAIN
AND IF I COULD THINK UP ANYTHING WORSE I WOULD DO THAT TOO BECAUSE AS
LONG AS I WAS IN AND IN FOR GOOD I MIGHT AS WELL GO THE WHOLE HOG
THEN I SET TO THINKING OVER HOW TO GET AT IT AND TURNED OVER SOME
CONSIDERABLE MANY WAYS IN MY MIND AND AT LAST FIXED UP A PLAN THAT
SUITED ME
SO THEN I TOOK THE BEARINGS OF A WOODY ISLAND THAT WAS DOWN
THE RIVER A PIECE AND AS SOON AS IT WAS FAIRLY DARK I CREPT OUT WITH MY
RAFT AND WENT FOR IT AND HID IT THERE AND THEN TURNED IN
I SLEPT THE
NIGHT THROUGH AND GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT AND HAD MY BREAKFAST
AND PUT ON MY STORE CLOTHES AND TIED UP SOME OTHERS AND ONE THING OR
ANOTHER IN A BUNDLE AND TOOK THE CANOE AND CLEARED FOR SHORE
I LANDED
BELOW WHERE I JUDGED WAS PHELPS'S PLACE AND HID MY BUNDLE IN THE WOODS
AND THEN FILLED UP THE CANOE WITH WATER AND LOADED ROCKS INTO HER AND
SUNK HER WHERE I COULD FIND HER AGAIN WHEN I WANTED HER ABOUT A QUARTER
OF A MILE BELOW A LITTLE STEAM SAWMILL THAT WAS ON THE BANK
THEN I STRUCK UP THE ROAD AND WHEN I PASSED THE MILL I SEE A SIGN ON
IT PHELPS'S SAWMILL AND WHEN I COME TO THE FARM HOUSES TWO OR
THREE HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER ALONG I KEPT MY EYES PEELED BUT DIDN'T
SEE NOBODY AROUND THOUGH IT WAS GOOD DAYLIGHT NOW
BUT I DIDN'T MIND
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE NOBODY JUST YET I ONLY WANTED TO GET THE
LAY OF THE LAND
ACCORDING TO MY PLAN I WAS GOING TO TURN UP THERE FROM
THE VILLAGE NOT FROM BELOW
SO I JUST TOOK A LOOK AND SHOVED ALONG
STRAIGHT FOR TOWN
WELL THE VERY FIRST MAN I SEE WHEN I GOT THERE WAS
THE DUKE
HE WAS STICKING UP A BILL FOR THE ROYAL NONESUCH THREE NIGHT
PERFORMANCE LIKE THAT OTHER TIME
THEY HAD THE CHEEK THEM FRAUDS I
WAS RIGHT ON HIM BEFORE I COULD SHIRK
HE LOOKED ASTONISHED AND SAYS
HEL LO WHERE'D YOU COME FROM THEN HE SAYS KIND OF GLAD AND
EAGER WHERE'S THE RAFT GOT HER IN A GOOD PLACE
I SAYS
WHY THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOUR GRACE
THEN HE DIDN'T LOOK SO JOYFUL AND SAYS
WHAT WAS YOUR IDEA FOR ASKING ME HE SAYS
WELL I SAYS WHEN I SEE THE KING IN THAT DOGGERY YESTERDAY I SAYS
TO MYSELF WE CAN'T GET HIM HOME FOR HOURS TILL HE'S SOBERER SO I WENT
A LOAFING AROUND TOWN TO PUT IN THE TIME AND WAIT
A MAN UP AND OFFERED
ME TEN CENTS TO HELP HIM PULL A SKIFF OVER THE RIVER AND BACK TO FETCH
A SHEEP AND SO I WENT ALONG BUT WHEN WE WAS DRAGGING HIM TO THE BOAT
AND THE MAN LEFT ME A HOLT OF THE ROPE AND WENT BEHIND HIM TO SHOVE HIM
ALONG HE WAS TOO STRONG FOR ME AND JERKED LOOSE AND RUN AND WE AFTER
HIM
WE DIDN'T HAVE NO DOG AND SO WE HAD TO CHASE HIM ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY TILL WE TIRED HIM OUT
WE NEVER GOT HIM TILL DARK THEN WE
FETCHED HIM OVER AND I STARTED DOWN FOR THE RAFT
WHEN I GOT THERE AND
SEE IT WAS GONE I SAYS TO MYSELF 'THEY'VE GOT INTO TROUBLE AND HAD TO
LEAVE AND THEY'VE TOOK MY NIGGER WHICH IS THE ONLY NIGGER I'VE GOT IN
THE WORLD AND NOW I'M IN A STRANGE COUNTRY AND AIN'T GOT NO PROPERTY
NO MORE NOR NOTHING AND NO WAY TO MAKE MY LIVING SO I SET DOWN AND
CRIED
I SLEPT IN THE WOODS ALL NIGHT
BUT WHAT DID BECOME OF THE
RAFT THEN AND JIM POOR JIM
BLAMED IF I KNOW THAT IS WHAT'S BECOME OF THE RAFT
THAT OLD FOOL HAD
MADE A TRADE AND GOT FORTY DOLLARS AND WHEN WE FOUND HIM IN THE DOGGERY
THE LOAFERS HAD MATCHED HALF DOLLARS WITH HIM AND GOT EVERY CENT BUT
WHAT HE'D SPENT FOR WHISKY AND WHEN I GOT HIM HOME LATE LAST NIGHT AND
FOUND THE RAFT GONE WE SAID 'THAT LITTLE RASCAL HAS STOLE OUR RAFT AND
SHOOK US AND RUN OFF DOWN THE RIVER
I WOULDN'T SHAKE MY NIGGER WOULD I THE ONLY NIGGER I HAD IN THE
WORLD AND THE ONLY PROPERTY
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT
FACT IS I RECKON WE'D COME TO CONSIDER HIM
OUR NIGGER YES WE DID CONSIDER HIM SO GOODNESS KNOWS WE HAD TROUBLE
ENOUGH FOR HIM
SO WHEN WE SEE THE RAFT WAS GONE AND WE FLAT BROKE
THERE WARN'T ANYTHING FOR IT BUT TO TRY THE ROYAL NONESUCH ANOTHER
SHAKE
AND I'VE PEGGED ALONG EVER SINCE DRY AS A POWDER HORN
WHERE'S
THAT TEN CENTS GIVE IT HERE
I HAD CONSIDERABLE MONEY SO I GIVE HIM TEN CENTS BUT BEGGED HIM TO
SPEND IT FOR SOMETHING TO EAT AND GIVE ME SOME BECAUSE IT WAS ALL THE
MONEY I HAD AND I HADN'T HAD NOTHING TO EAT SINCE YESTERDAY
HE NEVER
SAID NOTHING
THE NEXT MINUTE HE WHIRLS ON ME AND SAYS
DO YOU RECKON THAT NIGGER WOULD BLOW ON US WE'D SKIN HIM IF HE DONE
THAT
HOW CAN HE BLOW HAIN'T HE RUN OFF
NO THAT OLD FOOL SOLD HIM AND NEVER DIVIDED WITH ME AND THE MONEY'S
GONE
SOLD HIM I SAYS AND BEGUN TO CRY WHY HE WAS MY NIGGER AND
THAT WAS MY MONEY
WHERE IS HE I WANT MY NIGGER
WELL YOU CAN'T GET YOUR NIGGER THAT'S ALL SO DRY UP YOUR
BLUBBERING
LOOKY HERE DO YOU THINK YOU'D VENTURE TO BLOW ON US
BLAMED IF I THINK I'D TRUST YOU
WHY IF YOU WAS TO BLOW ON US
HE STOPPED BUT I NEVER SEE THE DUKE LOOK SO UGLY OUT OF HIS EYES
BEFORE
I WENT ON A WHIMPERING AND SAYS
I DON'T WANT TO BLOW ON NOBODY AND I AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO BLOW NOHOW
I GOT TO TURN OUT AND FIND MY NIGGER
HE LOOKED KINDER BOTHERED AND STOOD THERE WITH HIS BILLS FLUTTERING ON
HIS ARM THINKING AND WRINKLING UP HIS FOREHEAD
AT LAST HE SAYS
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
WE GOT TO BE HERE THREE DAYS
IF YOU'LL
PROMISE YOU WON'T BLOW AND WON'T LET THE NIGGER BLOW I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE TO FIND HIM
SO I PROMISED AND HE SAYS
A FARMER BY THE NAME OF SILAS PH AND THEN HE STOPPED
YOU SEE HE
STARTED TO TELL ME THE TRUTH BUT WHEN HE STOPPED THAT WAY AND BEGUN TO
STUDY AND THINK AGAIN I RECKONED HE WAS CHANGING HIS MIND
AND SO HE
WAS
HE WOULDN'T TRUST ME HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE OF HAVING ME OUT OF
THE WAY THE WHOLE THREE DAYS
SO PRETTY SOON HE SAYS
THE MAN THAT BOUGHT HIM IS NAMED ABRAM FOSTER ABRAM G
FOSTER AND HE
LIVES FORTY MILE BACK HERE IN THE COUNTRY ON THE ROAD TO LAFAYETTE
ALL RIGHT I SAYS I CAN WALK IT IN THREE DAYS
AND I'LL START THIS
VERY AFTERNOON
NO YOU WONT YOU'LL START NOW AND DON'T YOU LOSE ANY TIME ABOUT IT
NEITHER NOR DO ANY GABBLING BY THE WAY
JUST KEEP A TIGHT TONGUE IN
YOUR HEAD AND MOVE RIGHT ALONG AND THEN YOU WON'T GET INTO TROUBLE WITH
US D'YE HEAR
THAT WAS THE ORDER I WANTED AND THAT WAS THE ONE I PLAYED FOR
I
WANTED TO BE LEFT FREE TO WORK MY PLANS
SO CLEAR OUT HE SAYS AND YOU CAN TELL MR
FOSTER WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO
MAYBE YOU CAN GET HIM TO BELIEVE THAT JIM IS YOUR NIGGER SOME
IDIOTS DON'T REQUIRE DOCUMENTS LEASTWAYS I'VE HEARD THERE'S SUCH DOWN
SOUTH HERE
AND WHEN YOU TELL HIM THE HANDBILL AND THE REWARD'S BOGUS
MAYBE HE'LL BELIEVE YOU WHEN YOU EXPLAIN TO HIM WHAT THE IDEA WAS FOR
GETTING 'EM OUT
GO 'LONG NOW AND TELL HIM ANYTHING YOU WANT TO BUT
MIND YOU DON'T WORK YOUR JAW ANY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
SO I LEFT AND STRUCK FOR THE BACK COUNTRY
I DIDN'T LOOK AROUND BUT I
KINDER FELT LIKE HE WAS WATCHING ME
BUT I KNOWED I COULD TIRE HIM OUT
AT THAT
I WENT STRAIGHT OUT IN THE COUNTRY AS MUCH AS A MILE BEFORE
I STOPPED THEN I DOUBLED BACK THROUGH THE WOODS TOWARDS PHELPS'
I
RECKONED I BETTER START IN ON MY PLAN STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT FOOLING
AROUND BECAUSE I WANTED TO STOP JIM'S MOUTH TILL THESE FELLOWS COULD
GET AWAY
I DIDN'T WANT NO TROUBLE WITH THEIR KIND
I'D SEEN ALL I
WANTED TO OF THEM AND WANTED TO GET ENTIRELY SHUT OF THEM
CHAPTER XXXII
WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS ALL STILL AND SUNDAY LIKE AND HOT AND SUNSHINY
THE HANDS WAS GONE TO THE FIELDS AND THERE WAS THEM KIND OF FAINT
DRONINGS OF BUGS AND FLIES IN THE AIR THAT MAKES IT SEEM SO LONESOME AND
LIKE EVERYBODY'S DEAD AND GONE AND IF A BREEZE FANS ALONG AND QUIVERS
THE LEAVES IT MAKES YOU FEEL MOURNFUL BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S
SPIRITS WHISPERING SPIRITS THAT'S BEEN DEAD EVER SO MANY YEARS AND YOU
ALWAYS THINK THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU
AS A GENERAL THING IT MAKES A
BODY WISH HE WAS DEAD TOO AND DONE WITH IT ALL
PHELPS' WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY
ALL LOOK ALIKE
A RAIL FENCE ROUND A TWO ACRE YARD A STILE MADE OUT
OF LOGS SAWED OFF AND UP ENDED IN STEPS LIKE BARRELS OF A DIFFERENT
LENGTH TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE WITH AND FOR THE WOMEN TO STAND ON WHEN
THEY ARE GOING TO JUMP ON TO A HORSE SOME SICKLY GRASS PATCHES IN THE
BIG YARD BUT MOSTLY IT WAS BARE AND SMOOTH LIKE AN OLD HAT WITH THE
NAP RUBBED OFF BIG DOUBLE LOG HOUSE FOR THE WHITE FOLKS HEWED LOGS
WITH THE CHINKS STOPPED UP WITH MUD OR MORTAR AND THESE MUD STRIPES
BEEN WHITEWASHED SOME TIME OR ANOTHER ROUND LOG KITCHEN WITH A BIG
BROAD OPEN BUT ROOFED PASSAGE JOINING IT TO THE HOUSE LOG SMOKE HOUSE
BACK OF THE KITCHEN THREE LITTLE LOG NIGGER CABINS IN A ROW T'OTHER
SIDE THE SMOKE HOUSE ONE LITTLE HUT ALL BY ITSELF AWAY DOWN AGAINST
THE BACK FENCE AND SOME OUTBUILDINGS DOWN A PIECE THE OTHER SIDE
ASH HOPPER AND BIG KETTLE TO BILE SOAP IN BY THE LITTLE HUT BENCH BY
THE KITCHEN DOOR WITH BUCKET OF WATER AND A GOURD HOUND ASLEEP THERE
IN THE SUN MORE HOUNDS ASLEEP ROUND ABOUT ABOUT THREE SHADE TREES AWAY
OFF IN A CORNER SOME CURRANT BUSHES AND GOOSEBERRY BUSHES IN ONE PLACE
BY THE FENCE OUTSIDE OF THE FENCE A GARDEN AND A WATERMELON PATCH THEN
THE COTTON FIELDS BEGINS AND AFTER THE FIELDS THE WOODS
I WENT AROUND AND CLUMB OVER THE BACK STILE BY THE ASH HOPPER AND
STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN
WHEN I GOT A LITTLE WAYS I HEARD THE DIM HUM
OF A SPINNING WHEEL WAILING ALONG UP AND SINKING ALONG DOWN AGAIN
AND THEN I KNOWED FOR CERTAIN I WISHED I WAS DEAD FOR THAT IS THE
LONESOMEST SOUND IN THE WHOLE WORLD
I WENT RIGHT ALONG NOT FIXING UP ANY PARTICULAR PLAN BUT JUST TRUSTING
TO PROVIDENCE TO PUT THE RIGHT WORDS IN MY MOUTH WHEN THE TIME COME FOR
I'D NOTICED THAT PROVIDENCE ALWAYS DID PUT THE RIGHT WORDS IN MY MOUTH
IF I LEFT IT ALONE
WHEN I GOT HALF WAY FIRST ONE HOUND AND THEN ANOTHER GOT UP AND WENT
FOR ME AND OF COURSE I STOPPED AND FACED THEM AND KEPT STILL
AND
SUCH ANOTHER POWWOW AS THEY MADE IN A QUARTER OF A MINUTE I WAS A KIND
OF A HUB OF A WHEEL AS YOU MAY SAY SPOKES MADE OUT OF DOGS CIRCLE OF
FIFTEEN OF THEM PACKED TOGETHER AROUND ME WITH THEIR NECKS AND NOSES
STRETCHED UP TOWARDS ME A BARKING AND HOWLING AND MORE A COMING YOU
COULD SEE THEM SAILING OVER FENCES AND AROUND CORNERS FROM EVERYWHERES
A NIGGER WOMAN COME TEARING OUT OF THE KITCHEN WITH A ROLLING PIN IN HER
HAND SINGING OUT BEGONE YOU TIGE YOU SPOT BEGONE SAH AND SHE
FETCHED FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER OF THEM A CLIP AND SENT THEM HOWLING
AND THEN THE REST FOLLOWED AND THE NEXT SECOND HALF OF THEM COME BACK
WAGGING THEIR TAILS AROUND ME AND MAKING FRIENDS WITH ME
THERE AIN'T
NO HARM IN A HOUND NOHOW
AND BEHIND THE WOMAN COMES A LITTLE NIGGER GIRL AND TWO LITTLE NIGGER
BOYS WITHOUT ANYTHING ON BUT TOW LINEN SHIRTS AND THEY HUNG ON TO THEIR
MOTHER'S GOWN AND PEEPED OUT FROM BEHIND HER AT ME BASHFUL THE WAY
THEY ALWAYS DO
AND HERE COMES THE WHITE WOMAN RUNNING FROM THE HOUSE
ABOUT FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY YEAR OLD BAREHEADED AND HER SPINNING STICK
IN HER HAND AND BEHIND HER COMES HER LITTLE WHITE CHILDREN ACTING THE
SAME WAY THE LITTLE NIGGERS WAS DOING
SHE WAS SMILING ALL OVER SO SHE
COULD HARDLY STAND AND SAYS

I SAID I HAD GOT IT ON THE BOAT
SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE
LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING AFTER

A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS

BOAT WOULD BE COMING UP THE RIVER OR DOWN
BUT I GO A GOOD DEAL ON
INSTINCT AND MY INSTINCT SAID SHE WOULD BE COMING UP FROM DOWN TOWARDS
ORLEANS
THAT DIDN'T HELP ME MUCH THOUGH FOR I DIDN'T KNOW THE NAMES

I SEE I'D GOT TO INVENT A BAR OR FORGET THE
NAME OF THE ONE WE GOT AGROUND ON OR NOW I STRUCK AN IDEA AND FETCHED

TWO YEARS AGO
LAST CHRISTMAS YOUR UNCLE SILAS WAS COMING UP FROM NEWRLEANS ON THE OLD

BED AND GIVE ME A PULL AND OUT I COME AND WHEN HE TURNED BACK FROM THE
WINDOW THERE SHE STOOD A BEAMING AND A SMILING LIKE A HOUSE AFIRE AND

THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED

IT'S TOM SAWYER
BY JINGS I MOST SLUMPED THROUGH THE FLOOR BUT THERE WARN'T NO TIME TO
SWAP KNIVES THE OLD MAN GRABBED ME BY THE HAND AND SHOOK AND KEPT ON
SHAKING AND ALL THE TIME HOW THE WOMAN DID DANCE AROUND AND LAUGH AND
CRY AND THEN HOW THEY BOTH DID FIRE OFF QUESTIONS ABOUT SID AND MARY
AND THE REST OF THE TRIBE
BUT IF THEY WAS JOYFUL IT WARN'T NOTHING TO WHAT I WAS FOR IT WAS LIKE
BEING BORN AGAIN I WAS SO GLAD TO FIND OUT WHO I WAS
WELL THEY FROZE
TO ME FOR TWO HOURS AND AT LAST WHEN MY CHIN WAS SO TIRED IT COULDN'T
HARDLY GO ANY MORE I HAD TOLD THEM MORE ABOUT MY FAMILY I MEAN THE
SAWYER FAMILY THAN EVER HAPPENED TO ANY SIX SAWYER FAMILIES
AND I
EXPLAINED ALL ABOUT HOW WE BLOWED OUT A CYLINDER HEAD AT THE MOUTH OF
WHITE RIVER AND IT TOOK US THREE DAYS TO FIX IT
WHICH WAS ALL RIGHT
AND WORKED FIRST RATE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW BUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE
THREE DAYS TO FIX IT
IF I'D A CALLED IT A BOLTHEAD IT WOULD A DONE
JUST AS WELL
NOW I WAS FEELING PRETTY COMFORTABLE ALL DOWN ONE SIDE AND PRETTY
UNCOMFORTABLE ALL UP THE OTHER
BEING TOM SAWYER WAS EASY AND
COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A
STEAMBOAT COUGHING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE
TOM SAWYER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT AND S'POSE HE STEPS IN HERE ANY
MINUTE AND SINGS OUT MY NAME BEFORE I CAN THROW HIM A WINK TO KEEP
QUIET
WELL I COULDN'T HAVE IT THAT WAY IT WOULDN'T DO AT ALL
I MUST GO
UP THE ROAD AND WAYLAY HIM
SO I TOLD THE FOLKS I RECKONED I WOULD GO
UP TO THE TOWN AND FETCH DOWN MY BAGGAGE
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS FOR
GOING ALONG WITH ME BUT I SAID NO I COULD DRIVE THE HORSE MYSELF AND
I DRUTHER HE WOULDN'T TAKE NO TROUBLE ABOUT ME
CHAPTER XXXIII
SO I STARTED FOR TOWN IN THE WAGON AND WHEN I WAS HALF WAY I SEE A
WAGON COMING AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS TOM SAWYER AND I STOPPED AND
WAITED TILL HE COME ALONG
I SAYS HOLD ON AND IT STOPPED ALONGSIDE
AND HIS MOUTH OPENED UP LIKE A TRUNK AND STAYED SO AND HE SWALLOWED
TWO OR THREE TIMES LIKE A PERSON THAT'S GOT A DRY THROAT AND THEN SAYS
I HAIN'T EVER DONE YOU NO HARM

SO THEN WHAT YOU
WANT TO COME BACK AND HA'NT ME FOR
I SAYS

WHEN HE HEARD MY VOICE IT RIGHTED HIM UP SOME BUT HE WARN'T QUITE

SO HE DONE IT AND IT SATISFIED HIM AND HE WAS THAT GLAD TO SEE ME
AGAIN HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
AND HE WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
RIGHT OFF BECAUSE IT WAS A GRAND ADVENTURE AND MYSTERIOUS AND SO IT
HIT HIM WHERE HE LIVED
BUT I SAID LEAVE IT ALONE TILL BY AND BY AND
TOLD HIS DRIVER TO WAIT AND WE DROVE OFF A LITTLE PIECE AND I TOLD

SAID LET HIM ALONE A MINUTE AND DON'T DISTURB HIM
SO HE THOUGHT AND

THEN WE TOOK THE TRUNK AND PUT IT IN MY WAGON AND HE DROVE OFF HIS
WAY AND I DROVE MINE
BUT OF COURSE I FORGOT ALL ABOUT DRIVING SLOW ON
ACCOUNTS OF BEING GLAD AND FULL OF THINKING SO I GOT HOME A HEAP TOO
QUICK FOR THAT LENGTH OF A TRIP
THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS AT THE DOOR AND
HE SAYS
WHY THIS IS WONDERFUL WHOEVER WOULD A THOUGHT IT WAS IN THAT MARE

WHY I WOULDN'T TAKE A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THAT
HORSE NOW I WOULDN'T HONEST AND YET I'D A SOLD HER FOR FIFTEEN BEFORE
AND THOUGHT 'TWAS ALL SHE WAS WORTH
THAT'S ALL HE SAID
HE WAS THE INNOCENTEST BEST OLD SOUL I EVER SEE
BUT IT WARN'T SURPRISING BECAUSE HE WARN'T ONLY JUST A FARMER HE WAS
A PREACHER TOO AND HAD A LITTLE ONE HORSE LOG CHURCH DOWN BACK OF THE
PLANTATION WHICH HE BUILT IT HIMSELF AT HIS OWN EXPENSE FOR A CHURCH

WHEN HE GOT A FRONT OF US HE

WELL TO THINK OF THAT PERFORMANCE I DON'T DENY IT I
WAS MOST PUTRIFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN YOU GIVE ME THAT SMACK
WE HAD DINNER OUT IN THAT BROAD OPEN PASSAGE BETWIXT THE HOUSE AND
THE KITCHEN AND THERE WAS THINGS ENOUGH ON THAT TABLE FOR SEVEN
FAMILIES AND ALL HOT TOO NONE OF YOUR FLABBY TOUGH MEAT THAT'S LAID
IN A CUPBOARD IN A DAMP CELLAR ALL NIGHT AND TASTES LIKE A HUNK OF
OLD COLD CANNIBAL IN THE MORNING
UNCLE SILAS HE ASKED A PRETTY LONG
BLESSING OVER IT BUT IT WAS WORTH IT AND IT DIDN'T COOL IT A BIT
NEITHER THE WAY I'VE SEEN THEM KIND OF INTERRUPTIONS DO LOTS OF TIMES
THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE GOOD DEAL OF TALK ALL THE AFTERNOON AND ME
AND TOM WAS ON THE LOOKOUT ALL THE TIME BUT IT WARN'T NO USE THEY
DIDN'T HAPPEN TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT ANY RUNAWAY NIGGER AND WE WAS AFRAID
TO TRY TO WORK UP TO IT
BUT AT SUPPER AT NIGHT ONE OF THE LITTLE
BOYS SAYS
PA MAYN'T TOM AND SID AND ME GO TO THE SHOW
NO SAYS THE OLD MAN I RECKON THERE AIN'T GOING TO BE ANY AND YOU
COULDN'T GO IF THERE WAS BECAUSE THE RUNAWAY NIGGER TOLD BURTON AND
ME ALL ABOUT THAT SCANDALOUS SHOW AND BURTON SAID HE WOULD TELL THE
PEOPLE SO I RECKON THEY'VE DROVE THE OWDACIOUS LOAFERS OUT OF TOWN
BEFORE THIS TIME
SO THERE IT WAS BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT
TOM AND ME WAS TO SLEEP IN THE
SAME ROOM AND BED SO BEING TIRED WE BID GOOD NIGHT AND WENT UP TO
BED RIGHT AFTER SUPPER AND CLUMB OUT OF THE WINDOW AND DOWN THE
LIGHTNING ROD AND SHOVED FOR THE TOWN FOR I DIDN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY WAS
GOING TO GIVE THE KING AND THE DUKE A HINT AND SO IF I DIDN'T HURRY UP
AND GIVE THEM ONE THEY'D GET INTO TROUBLE SURE
ON THE ROAD TOM HE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT HOW IT WAS RECKONED I WAS MURDERED
AND HOW PAP DISAPPEARED PRETTY SOON AND DIDN'T COME BACK NO MORE AND
WHAT A STIR THERE WAS WHEN JIM RUN AWAY AND I TOLD TOM ALL ABOUT OUR
ROYAL NONESUCH RAPSCALLIONS AND AS MUCH OF THE RAFT VOYAGE AS I HAD
TIME TO AND AS WE STRUCK INTO THE TOWN AND UP THROUGH THE THE MIDDLE OF
IT IT WAS AS MUCH AS HALF AFTER EIGHT THEN HERE COMES A RAGING RUSH OF
PEOPLE WITH TORCHES AND AN AWFUL WHOOPING AND YELLING AND BANGING TIN
PANS AND BLOWING HORNS AND WE JUMPED TO ONE SIDE TO LET THEM GO BY
AND AS THEY WENT BY I SEE THEY HAD THE KING AND THE DUKE ASTRADDLE OF A
RAIL THAT IS I KNOWED IT WAS THE KING AND THE DUKE THOUGH THEY WAS
ALL OVER TAR AND FEATHERS AND DIDN'T LOOK LIKE NOTHING IN THE
WORLD THAT WAS HUMAN JUST LOOKED LIKE A COUPLE OF MONSTROUS BIG
SOLDIER PLUMES
WELL IT MADE ME SICK TO SEE IT AND I WAS SORRY FOR
THEM POOR PITIFUL RASCALS IT SEEMED LIKE I COULDN'T EVER FEEL ANY
HARDNESS AGAINST THEM ANY MORE IN THE WORLD
IT WAS A DREADFUL THING TO
SEE
HUMAN BEINGS CAN BE AWFUL CRUEL TO ONE ANOTHER
WE SEE WE WAS TOO LATE COULDN'T DO NO GOOD
WE ASKED SOME STRAGGLERS
ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID EVERYBODY WENT TO THE SHOW LOOKING VERY
INNOCENT AND LAID LOW AND KEPT DARK TILL THE POOR OLD KING WAS IN THE
MIDDLE OF HIS CAVORTINGS ON THE STAGE THEN SOMEBODY GIVE A SIGNAL AND
THE HOUSE ROSE UP AND WENT FOR THEM
SO WE POKED ALONG BACK HOME AND I WARN'T FEELING SO BRASH AS I WAS
BEFORE BUT KIND OF ORNERY AND HUMBLE AND TO BLAME SOMEHOW THOUGH
I HADN'T DONE NOTHING
BUT THAT'S ALWAYS THE WAY IT DON'T MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE WHETHER YOU DO RIGHT OR WRONG A PERSON'S CONSCIENCE AIN'T
GOT NO SENSE AND JUST GOES FOR HIM ANYWAY
IF I HAD A YALLER DOG THAT
DIDN'T KNOW NO MORE THAN A PERSON'S CONSCIENCE DOES I WOULD PISON HIM
IT TAKES UP MORE ROOM THAN ALL THE REST OF A PERSON'S INSIDES AND YET
AIN'T NO GOOD NOHOW
TOM SAWYER HE SAYS THE SAME
CHAPTER XXXIV
WE STOPPED TALKING AND GOT TO THINKING
BY AND BY TOM SAYS
LOOKY HERE HUCK WHAT FOOLS WE ARE TO NOT THINK OF IT BEFORE I BET I
KNOW WHERE JIM IS
NO WHERE
IN THAT HUT DOWN BY THE ASH HOPPER
WHY LOOKY HERE
WHEN WE WAS AT
DINNER DIDN'T YOU SEE A NIGGER MAN GO IN THERE WITH SOME VITTLES
YES
WHAT DID YOU THINK THE VITTLES WAS FOR
FOR A DOG
SO 'D I
WELL IT WASN'T FOR A DOG
WHY
BECAUSE PART OF IT WAS WATERMELON
SO IT WAS I NOTICED IT
WELL IT DOES BEAT ALL THAT I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT A DOG NOT EATING WATERMELON
IT SHOWS HOW A BODY CAN SEE AND
DON'T SEE AT THE SAME TIME
WELL THE NIGGER UNLOCKED THE PADLOCK WHEN HE WENT IN AND HE LOCKED IT
AGAIN WHEN HE CAME OUT
HE FETCHED UNCLE A KEY ABOUT THE TIME WE GOT UP
FROM TABLE SAME KEY I BET
WATERMELON SHOWS MAN LOCK SHOWS PRISONER
AND IT AIN'T LIKELY THERE'S TWO PRISONERS ON SUCH A LITTLE PLANTATION
AND WHERE THE PEOPLE'S ALL SO KIND AND GOOD
JIM'S THE PRISONER
ALL
RIGHT I'M GLAD WE FOUND IT OUT DETECTIVE FASHION I WOULDN'T GIVE SHUCKS
FOR ANY OTHER WAY
NOW YOU WORK YOUR MIND AND STUDY OUT A PLAN TO
STEAL JIM AND I WILL STUDY OUT ONE TOO AND WE'LL TAKE THE ONE WE LIKE
THE BEST
WHAT A HEAD FOR JUST A BOY TO HAVE IF I HAD TOM SAWYER'S HEAD I
WOULDN'T TRADE IT OFF TO BE A DUKE NOR MATE OF A STEAMBOAT NOR CLOWN
IN A CIRCUS NOR NOTHING I CAN THINK OF
I WENT TO THINKING OUT A PLAN
BUT ONLY JUST TO BE DOING SOMETHING I KNOWED VERY WELL WHERE THE RIGHT
PLAN WAS GOING TO COME FROM
PRETTY SOON TOM SAYS
READY
YES I SAYS
ALL RIGHT BRING IT OUT
MY PLAN IS THIS I SAYS
WE CAN EASY FIND OUT IF IT'S JIM IN THERE
THEN GET UP MY CANOE TO MORROW NIGHT AND FETCH MY RAFT OVER FROM THE
ISLAND
THEN THE FIRST DARK NIGHT THAT COMES STEAL THE KEY OUT OF THE
OLD MAN'S BRITCHES AFTER HE GOES TO BED AND SHOVE OFF DOWN THE RIVER
ON THE RAFT WITH JIM HIDING DAYTIMES AND RUNNING NIGHTS THE WAY ME AND
JIM USED TO DO BEFORE
WOULDN'T THAT PLAN WORK
WORK WHY CERT'NLY IT WOULD WORK LIKE RATS A FIGHTING
BUT IT'S
TOO BLAME' SIMPLE THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO IT
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF A
PLAN THAT AIN'T NO MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT IT'S AS MILD AS GOOSE MILK
WHY HUCK IT WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TALK THAN BREAKING INTO A SOAP
FACTORY
I NEVER SAID NOTHING BECAUSE I WARN'T EXPECTING NOTHING DIFFERENT BUT
I KNOWED MIGHTY WELL THAT WHENEVER HE GOT HIS PLAN READY IT WOULDN'T
HAVE NONE OF THEM OBJECTIONS TO IT
AND IT DIDN'T
HE TOLD ME WHAT IT WAS AND I SEE IN A MINUTE IT WAS
WORTH FIFTEEN OF MINE FOR STYLE AND WOULD MAKE JIM JUST AS FREE A MAN
AS MINE WOULD AND MAYBE GET US ALL KILLED BESIDES
SO I WAS SATISFIED
AND SAID WE WOULD WALTZ IN ON IT
I NEEDN'T TELL WHAT IT WAS HERE
BECAUSE I KNOWED IT WOULDN'T STAY THE WAY IT WAS
I KNOWED HE WOULD BE
CHANGING IT AROUND EVERY WHICH WAY AS WE WENT ALONG AND HEAVING IN NEW
BULLINESSES WHEREVER HE GOT A CHANCE
AND THAT IS WHAT HE DONE
WELL ONE THING WAS DEAD SURE AND THAT WAS THAT TOM SAWYER WAS IN
EARNEST AND WAS ACTULY GOING TO HELP STEAL THAT NIGGER OUT OF SLAVERY
THAT WAS THE THING THAT WAS TOO MANY FOR ME
HERE WAS A BOY THAT WAS
RESPECTABLE AND WELL BRUNG UP AND HAD A CHARACTER TO LOSE AND FOLKS AT
HOME THAT HAD CHARACTERS AND HE WAS BRIGHT AND NOT LEATHER HEADED AND
KNOWING AND NOT IGNORANT AND NOT MEAN BUT KIND AND YET HERE HE WAS
WITHOUT ANY MORE PRIDE OR RIGHTNESS OR FEELING THAN TO STOOP TO
THIS BUSINESS AND MAKE HIMSELF A SHAME AND HIS FAMILY A SHAME
BEFORE EVERYBODY
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT NO WAY AT ALL
IT WAS
OUTRAGEOUS AND I KNOWED I OUGHT TO JUST UP AND TELL HIM SO AND SO BE
HIS TRUE FRIEND AND LET HIM QUIT THE THING RIGHT WHERE HE WAS AND SAVE
HIMSELF
AND I DID START TO TELL HIM BUT HE SHUT ME UP AND SAYS
DON'T YOU RECKON I KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT DON'T I GENERLY KNOW WHAT I'M
ABOUT
YES
DIDN'T I SAY I WAS GOING TO HELP STEAL THE NIGGER
YES
WELL THEN
THAT'S ALL HE SAID AND THAT'S ALL I SAID
IT WARN'T NO USE TO SAY ANY
MORE BECAUSE WHEN HE SAID HE'D DO A THING HE ALWAYS DONE IT
BUT I
COULDN'T MAKE OUT HOW HE WAS WILLING TO GO INTO THIS THING SO I JUST
LET IT GO AND NEVER BOTHERED NO MORE ABOUT IT
IF HE WAS BOUND TO HAVE
IT SO I COULDN'T HELP IT
WHEN WE GOT HOME THE HOUSE WAS ALL DARK AND STILL SO WE WENT ON DOWN TO
THE HUT BY THE ASH HOPPER FOR TO EXAMINE IT
WE WENT THROUGH THE YARD
SO AS TO SEE WHAT THE HOUNDS WOULD DO
THEY KNOWED US AND DIDN'T MAKE
NO MORE NOISE THAN COUNTRY DOGS IS ALWAYS DOING WHEN ANYTHING COMES BY
IN THE NIGHT
WHEN WE GOT TO THE CABIN WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE FRONT AND
THE TWO SIDES AND ON THE SIDE I WARN'T ACQUAINTED WITH WHICH WAS THE
NORTH SIDE WE FOUND A SQUARE WINDOW HOLE UP TOLERABLE HIGH WITH JUST
ONE STOUT BOARD NAILED ACROSS IT
I SAYS
HERE'S THE TICKET
THIS HOLE'S BIG ENOUGH FOR JIM TO GET THROUGH IF WE
WRENCH OFF THE BOARD
TOM SAYS
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS TIT TAT TOE THREE IN A ROW AND AS EASY AS
PLAYING HOOKY
I SHOULD HOPE WE CAN FIND A WAY THAT'S A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT HUCK FINN
WELL THEN I SAYS HOW 'LL IT DO TO SAW HIM OUT THE WAY I DONE
BEFORE I WAS MURDERED THAT TIME
THAT'S MORE LIKE HE SAYS
IT'S REAL MYSTERIOUS AND TROUBLESOME
AND GOOD HE SAYS BUT I BET WE CAN FIND A WAY THAT'S TWICE AS LONG
THERE AIN'T NO HURRY LE'S KEEP ON LOOKING AROUND
BETWIXT THE HUT AND THE FENCE ON THE BACK SIDE WAS A LEAN TO THAT
JOINED THE HUT AT THE EAVES AND WAS MADE OUT OF PLANK
IT WAS AS LONG
AS THE HUT BUT NARROW ONLY ABOUT SIX FOOT WIDE
THE DOOR TO IT WAS AT
THE SOUTH END AND WAS PADLOCKED
TOM HE WENT TO THE SOAP KETTLE AND
SEARCHED AROUND AND FETCHED BACK THE IRON THING THEY LIFT THE LID WITH
SO HE TOOK IT AND PRIZED OUT ONE OF THE STAPLES
THE CHAIN FELL DOWN
AND WE OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT IN AND SHUT IT AND STRUCK A MATCH
AND SEE THE SHED WAS ONLY BUILT AGAINST A CABIN AND HADN'T NO CONNECTION
WITH IT AND THERE WARN'T NO FLOOR TO THE SHED NOR NOTHING IN IT BUT
SOME OLD RUSTY PLAYED OUT HOES AND SPADES AND PICKS AND A CRIPPLED PLOW
THE MATCH WENT OUT AND SO DID WE AND SHOVED IN THE STAPLE AGAIN AND
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AS GOOD AS EVER
TOM WAS JOYFUL
HE SAYS
NOW WE'RE ALL RIGHT
WE'LL DIG HIM OUT
IT 'LL TAKE ABOUT A WEEK
THEN WE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE AND I WENT IN THE BACK DOOR YOU ONLY HAVE
TO PULL A BUCKSKIN LATCH STRING THEY DON'T FASTEN THE DOORS BUT THAT
WARN'T ROMANTICAL ENOUGH FOR TOM SAWYER NO WAY WOULD DO HIM BUT HE MUST
CLIMB UP THE LIGHTNING ROD
BUT AFTER HE GOT UP HALF WAY ABOUT THREE
TIMES AND MISSED FIRE AND FELL EVERY TIME AND THE LAST TIME MOST
BUSTED HIS BRAINS OUT HE THOUGHT HE'D GOT TO GIVE IT UP BUT AFTER HE
WAS RESTED HE ALLOWED HE WOULD GIVE HER ONE MORE TURN FOR LUCK AND THIS
TIME HE MADE THE TRIP
IN THE MORNING WE WAS UP AT BREAK OF DAY AND DOWN TO THE NIGGER CABINS
TO PET THE DOGS AND MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE NIGGER THAT FED JIM IF IT
WAS JIM THAT WAS BEING FED
THE NIGGERS WAS JUST GETTING THROUGH
BREAKFAST AND STARTING FOR THE FIELDS AND JIM'S NIGGER WAS PILING UP
A TIN PAN WITH BREAD AND MEAT AND THINGS AND WHILST THE OTHERS WAS
LEAVING THE KEY COME FROM THE HOUSE
THIS NIGGER HAD A GOOD NATURED CHUCKLE HEADED FACE AND HIS WOOL WAS
ALL TIED UP IN LITTLE BUNCHES WITH THREAD
THAT WAS TO KEEP WITCHES
OFF
HE SAID THE WITCHES WAS PESTERING HIM AWFUL THESE NIGHTS AND
MAKING HIM SEE ALL KINDS OF STRANGE THINGS AND HEAR ALL KINDS OF
STRANGE WORDS AND NOISES AND HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS EVER WITCHED SO
LONG BEFORE IN HIS LIFE
HE GOT SO WORKED UP AND GOT TO RUNNING ON SO
ABOUT HIS TROUBLES HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE'D BEEN A GOING TO DO
SO TOM SAYS
WHAT'S THE VITTLES FOR GOING TO FEED THE DOGS
THE NIGGER KIND OF SMILED AROUND GRADUALLY OVER HIS FACE LIKE WHEN YOU
HEAVE A BRICKBAT IN A MUD PUDDLE AND HE SAYS
YES MARS SID A DOG
CUR'US DOG TOO
DOES YOU WANT TO GO EN LOOK AT
'IM
YES
I HUNCHED TOM AND WHISPERS
YOU GOING RIGHT HERE IN THE DAYBREAK THAT WARN'T THE PLAN
NO IT WARN'T BUT IT'S THE PLAN NOW
SO DRAT HIM WE WENT ALONG BUT I DIDN'T LIKE IT MUCH
WHEN WE GOT IN
WE COULDN'T HARDLY SEE ANYTHING IT WAS SO DARK BUT JIM WAS THERE SURE
ENOUGH AND COULD SEE US AND HE SINGS OUT
WHY HUCK EN GOOD LAN AIN' DAT MISTO TOM
I JUST KNOWED HOW IT WOULD BE I JUST EXPECTED IT
I DIDN'T KNOW
NOTHING TO DO AND IF I HAD I COULDN'T A DONE IT BECAUSE THAT NIGGER
BUSTED IN AND SAYS
WHY DE GRACIOUS SAKES DO HE KNOW YOU GENLMEN
WE COULD SEE PRETTY WELL NOW
TOM HE LOOKED AT THE NIGGER STEADY AND
KIND OF WONDERING AND SAYS
DOES WHO KNOW US
WHY DIS YER RUNAWAY NIGGER
I DON'T RECKON HE DOES BUT WHAT PUT THAT INTO YOUR HEAD
WHAT PUT IT DAR DIDN' HE JIS' DIS MINUTE SING OUT LIKE HE KNOWED
YOU
TOM SAYS IN A PUZZLED UP KIND OF WAY
WELL THAT'S MIGHTY CURIOUS
WHO SUNG OUT WHEN DID HE SING OUT
WHAT DID HE SING OUT AND TURNS TO ME PERFECTLY CA'M AND SAYS
DID YOU HEAR ANYBODY SING OUT
OF COURSE THERE WARN'T NOTHING TO BE SAID BUT THE ONE THING SO I SAYS
NO I AIN'T HEARD NOBODY SAY NOTHING
THEN HE TURNS TO JIM AND LOOKS HIM OVER LIKE HE NEVER SEE HIM BEFORE
AND SAYS
DID YOU SING OUT
NO SAH SAYS JIM I HAIN'T SAID NOTHING SAH
NOT A WORD
NO SAH I HAIN'T SAID A WORD
DID YOU EVER SEE US BEFORE
NO SAH NOT AS I KNOWS ON
SO TOM TURNS TO THE NIGGER WHICH WAS LOOKING WILD AND DISTRESSED AND
SAYS KIND OF SEVERE
WHAT DO YOU RECKON'S THE MATTER WITH YOU ANYWAY WHAT MADE YOU THINK
SOMEBODY SUNG OUT
OH IT'S DE DAD BLAME' WITCHES SAH EN I WISHT I WAS DEAD I DO
DEY'S AWLUZ AT IT SAH EN DEY DO MOS' KILL ME DEY SK'YERS ME SO

WHEN YOU FINE IT OUT EN TELL UM 'BOUT IT DEY DOAN' B'LIEVE YOU
TOM GIVE HIM A DIME AND SAID WE WOULDN'T TELL NOBODY AND TOLD HIM TO
BUY SOME MORE THREAD TO TIE UP HIS WOOL WITH AND THEN LOOKS AT JIM AND
SAYS
I WONDER IF UNCLE SILAS IS GOING TO HANG THIS NIGGER
IF I WAS TO
CATCH A NIGGER THAT WAS UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO RUN AWAY I WOULDN'T GIVE
HIM UP I'D HANG HIM AND WHILST THE NIGGER STEPPED TO THE DOOR TO
LOOK AT THE DIME AND BITE IT TO SEE IF IT WAS GOOD HE WHISPERS TO JIM
AND SAYS
DON'T EVER LET ON TO KNOW US
AND IF YOU HEAR ANY DIGGING GOING ON
NIGHTS IT'S US WE'RE GOING TO SET YOU FREE
JIM ONLY HAD TIME TO GRAB US BY THE HAND AND SQUEEZE IT THEN THE NIGGER
COME BACK AND WE SAID WE'D COME AGAIN SOME TIME IF THE NIGGER WANTED
US TO AND HE SAID HE WOULD MORE PARTICULAR IF IT WAS DARK BECAUSE THE
WITCHES WENT FOR HIM MOSTLY IN THE DARK AND IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE FOLKS
AROUND THEN
CHAPTER XXXV
IT WOULD BE MOST AN HOUR YET TILL BREAKFAST SO WE LEFT AND STRUCK DOWN
INTO THE WOODS BECAUSE TOM SAID WE GOT TO HAVE SOME LIGHT TO SEE HOW
TO DIG BY AND A LANTERN MAKES TOO MUCH AND MIGHT GET US INTO TROUBLE
WHAT WE MUST HAVE WAS A LOT OF THEM ROTTEN CHUNKS THAT'S CALLED
FOX FIRE AND JUST MAKES A SOFT KIND OF A GLOW WHEN YOU LAY THEM IN A
DARK PLACE
WE FETCHED AN ARMFUL AND HID IT IN THE WEEDS AND SET DOWN
TO REST AND TOM SAYS KIND OF DISSATISFIED
BLAME IT THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST AS EASY AND AWKWARD AS IT CAN BE
AND SO IT MAKES IT SO ROTTEN DIFFICULT TO GET UP A DIFFICULT PLAN
THERE AIN'T NO WATCHMAN TO BE DRUGGED NOW THERE OUGHT TO BE A
WATCHMAN
THERE AIN'T EVEN A DOG TO GIVE A SLEEPING MIXTURE TO
AND
THERE'S JIM CHAINED BY ONE LEG WITH A TEN FOOT CHAIN TO THE LEG OF HIS
BED WHY ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS TO LIFT UP THE BEDSTEAD AND SLIP OFF
THE CHAIN
AND UNCLE SILAS HE TRUSTS EVERYBODY SENDS THE KEY TO THE
PUNKIN HEADED NIGGER AND DON'T SEND NOBODY TO WATCH THE NIGGER
JIM
COULD A GOT OUT OF THAT WINDOW HOLE BEFORE THIS ONLY THERE WOULDN'T BE
NO USE TRYING TO TRAVEL WITH A TEN FOOT CHAIN ON HIS LEG
WHY DRAT IT
HUCK IT'S THE STUPIDEST ARRANGEMENT I EVER SEE
YOU GOT TO INVENT ALL
THE DIFFICULTIES
WELL WE CAN'T HELP IT WE GOT TO DO THE BEST WE CAN
WITH THE MATERIALS WE'VE GOT
ANYHOW THERE'S ONE THING THERE'S MORE
HONOR IN GETTING HIM OUT THROUGH A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS
WHERE THERE WARN'T ONE OF THEM FURNISHED TO YOU BY THE PEOPLE WHO IT WAS
THEIR DUTY TO FURNISH THEM AND YOU HAD TO CONTRIVE THEM ALL OUT OF YOUR
OWN HEAD
NOW LOOK AT JUST THAT ONE THING OF THE LANTERN
WHEN YOU
COME DOWN TO THE COLD FACTS WE SIMPLY GOT TO LET ON THAT A LANTERN'S
RESKY
WHY WE COULD WORK WITH A TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION IF WE WANTED TO
I BELIEVE
NOW WHILST I THINK OF IT WE GOT TO HUNT UP SOMETHING TO
MAKE A SAW OUT OF THE FIRST CHANCE WE GET
WHAT DO WE WANT OF A SAW
WHAT DO WE WANT OF IT HAIN'T WE GOT TO SAW THE LEG OF JIM'S BED
OFF SO AS TO GET THE CHAIN LOOSE
WHY YOU JUST SAID A BODY COULD LIFT UP THE BEDSTEAD AND SLIP THE CHAIN
OFF
WELL IF THAT AIN'T JUST LIKE YOU HUCK FINN
YOU CAN GET UP THE
INFANT SCHOOLIEST WAYS OF GOING AT A THING
WHY HAIN'T YOU EVER READ
ANY BOOKS AT ALL BARON TRENCK NOR CASANOVA NOR BENVENUTO CHELLEENY
NOR HENRI IV NOR NONE OF THEM HEROES WHO EVER HEARD OF GETTING A
PRISONER LOOSE IN SUCH AN OLD MAIDY WAY AS THAT NO THE WAY ALL THE
BEST AUTHORITIES DOES IS TO SAW THE BED LEG IN TWO AND LEAVE IT JUST
SO AND SWALLOW THE SAWDUST SO IT CAN'T BE FOUND AND PUT SOME DIRT AND
GREASE AROUND THE SAWED PLACE SO THE VERY KEENEST SENESKAL CAN'T SEE
NO SIGN OF IT'S BEING SAWED AND THINKS THE BED LEG IS PERFECTLY SOUND
THEN THE NIGHT YOU'RE READY FETCH THE LEG A KICK DOWN SHE GOES SLIP
OFF YOUR CHAIN AND THERE YOU ARE
NOTHING TO DO BUT HITCH YOUR
ROPE LADDER TO THE BATTLEMENTS SHIN DOWN IT BREAK YOUR LEG IN THE
MOAT BECAUSE A ROPE LADDER IS NINETEEN FOOT TOO SHORT YOU KNOW AND
THERE'S YOUR HORSES AND YOUR TRUSTY VASSLES AND THEY SCOOP YOU UP AND
FLING YOU ACROSS A SADDLE AND AWAY YOU GO TO YOUR NATIVE LANGUDOC OR
NAVARRE OR WHEREVER IT IS
IT'S GAUDY HUCK
I WISH THERE WAS A MOAT
TO THIS CABIN
IF WE GET TIME THE NIGHT OF THE ESCAPE WE'LL DIG ONE
I SAYS
WHAT DO WE WANT OF A MOAT WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SNAKE HIM OUT FROM UNDER
THE CABIN
BUT HE NEVER HEARD ME
HE HAD FORGOT ME AND EVERYTHING ELSE
HE HAD
HIS CHIN IN HIS HAND THINKING
PRETTY SOON HE SIGHS AND SHAKES HIS
HEAD THEN SIGHS AGAIN AND SAYS
NO IT WOULDN'T DO THERE AIN'T NECESSITY ENOUGH FOR IT
FOR WHAT I SAYS
WHY TO SAW JIM'S LEG OFF HE SAYS
GOOD LAND I SAYS WHY THERE AIN'T NO NECESSITY FOR IT
AND WHAT
WOULD YOU WANT TO SAW HIS LEG OFF FOR ANYWAY
WELL SOME OF THE BEST AUTHORITIES HAS DONE IT
THEY COULDN'T GET THE
CHAIN OFF SO THEY JUST CUT THEIR HAND OFF AND SHOVED
AND A LEG WOULD
BE BETTER STILL
BUT WE GOT TO LET THAT GO
THERE AIN'T NECESSITY
ENOUGH IN THIS CASE AND BESIDES JIM'S A NIGGER AND WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR IT AND HOW IT'S THE CUSTOM IN EUROPE SO
WE'LL LET IT GO
BUT THERE'S ONE THING HE CAN HAVE A ROPE LADDER WE
CAN TEAR UP OUR SHEETS AND MAKE HIM A ROPE LADDER EASY ENOUGH
AND WE
CAN SEND IT TO HIM IN A PIE IT'S MOSTLY DONE THAT WAY
AND I'VE ET
WORSE PIES
WHY TOM SAWYER HOW YOU TALK I SAYS JIM AIN'T GOT NO USE FOR A
ROPE LADDER
HE HAS GOT USE FOR IT
HOW YOU TALK YOU BETTER SAY YOU DON'T
KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
HE'S GOT TO HAVE A ROPE LADDER THEY ALL DO
WHAT IN THE NATION CAN HE DO WITH IT
DO WITH IT HE CAN HIDE IT IN HIS BED CAN'T HE THAT'S WHAT THEY
ALL DO AND HE'S GOT TO TOO
HUCK YOU DON'T EVER SEEM TO WANT TO DO
ANYTHING THAT'S REGULAR YOU WANT TO BE STARTING SOMETHING FRESH ALL THE
TIME
S'POSE HE DON'T DO NOTHING WITH IT AIN'T IT THERE IN HIS BED
FOR A CLEW AFTER HE'S GONE AND DON'T YOU RECKON THEY'LL WANT CLEWS
OF COURSE THEY WILL
AND YOU WOULDN'T LEAVE THEM ANY THAT WOULD BE A
PRETTY HOWDY DO WOULDN'T IT I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
WELL I SAYS IF IT'S IN THE REGULATIONS AND HE'S GOT TO HAVE
IT ALL RIGHT LET HIM HAVE IT BECAUSE I DON'T WISH TO GO BACK ON NO
REGULATIONS BUT THERE'S ONE THING TOM SAWYER IF WE GO TO TEARING UP
OUR SHEETS TO MAKE JIM A ROPE LADDER WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO TROUBLE
WITH AUNT SALLY JUST AS SURE AS YOU'RE BORN
NOW THE WAY I LOOK AT
IT A HICKRY BARK LADDER DON'T COST NOTHING AND DON'T WASTE NOTHING
AND IS JUST AS GOOD TO LOAD UP A PIE WITH AND HIDE IN A STRAW TICK
AS ANY RAG LADDER YOU CAN START AND AS FOR JIM HE AIN'T HAD NO
EXPERIENCE AND SO HE DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF A
OH SHUCKS HUCK FINN IF I WAS AS IGNORANT AS YOU I'D KEEP
STILL THAT'S WHAT I'D DO
WHO EVER HEARD OF A STATE PRISONER ESCAPING
BY A HICKRY BARK LADDER WHY IT'S PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS
WELL ALL RIGHT TOM FIX IT YOUR OWN WAY BUT IF YOU'LL TAKE MY
ADVICE YOU'LL LET ME BORROW A SHEET OFF OF THE CLOTHESLINE
HE SAID THAT WOULD DO
AND THAT GAVE HIM ANOTHER IDEA AND HE SAYS
BORROW A SHIRT TOO
WHAT DO WE WANT OF A SHIRT TOM
WANT IT FOR JIM TO KEEP A JOURNAL ON
JOURNAL YOUR GRANNY JIM CAN'T WRITE
S'POSE HE CAN'T WRITE HE CAN MAKE MARKS ON THE SHIRT CAN'T HE IF
WE MAKE HIM A PEN OUT OF AN OLD PEWTER SPOON OR A PIECE OF AN OLD IRON
BARREL HOOP
WHY TOM WE CAN PULL A FEATHER OUT OF A GOOSE AND MAKE HIM A BETTER
ONE AND QUICKER TOO
PRISONERS DON'T HAVE GEESE RUNNING AROUND THE DONJON KEEP TO PULL
PENS OUT OF YOU MUGGINS
THEY ALWAYS MAKE THEIR PENS OUT OF THE
HARDEST TOUGHEST TROUBLESOMEST PIECE OF OLD BRASS CANDLESTICK OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON AND IT TAKES THEM WEEKS
AND WEEKS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS TO FILE IT OUT TOO BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT
TO DO IT BY RUBBING IT ON THE WALL
THEY WOULDN'T USE A GOOSE QUILL
IF THEY HAD IT
IT AIN'T REGULAR
WELL THEN WHAT'LL WE MAKE HIM THE INK OUT OF
MANY MAKES IT OUT OF IRON RUST AND TEARS BUT THAT'S THE COMMON SORT
AND WOMEN THE BEST AUTHORITIES USES THEIR OWN BLOOD
JIM CAN DO THAT
AND WHEN HE WANTS TO SEND ANY LITTLE COMMON ORDINARY MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE
TO LET THE WORLD KNOW WHERE HE'S CAPTIVATED HE CAN WRITE IT ON THE
BOTTOM OF A TIN PLATE WITH A FORK AND THROW IT OUT OF THE WINDOW
THE
IRON MASK ALWAYS DONE THAT AND IT'S A BLAME' GOOD WAY TOO
JIM AIN'T GOT NO TIN PLATES
THEY FEED HIM IN A PAN
THAT AIN'T NOTHING WE CAN GET HIM SOME
CAN'T NOBODY READ HIS PLATES
THAT AIN'T GOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT HUCK FINN
ALL HE'S GOT TO
DO IS TO WRITE ON THE PLATE AND THROW IT OUT
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ABLE TO READ IT
WHY HALF THE TIME YOU CAN'T READ ANYTHING A PRISONER
WRITES ON A TIN PLATE OR ANYWHERE ELSE
WELL THEN WHAT'S THE SENSE IN WASTING THE PLATES
WHY BLAME IT ALL IT AIN'T THE PRISONER'S PLATES
BUT IT'S SOMEBODY'S PLATES AIN'T IT
WELL SPOS'N IT IS WHAT DOES THE PRISONER CARE WHOSE
HE BROKE OFF THERE BECAUSE WE HEARD THE BREAKFAST HORN BLOWING
SO WE
CLEARED OUT FOR THE HOUSE
ALONG DURING THE MORNING I BORROWED A SHEET AND A WHITE SHIRT OFF OF THE
CLOTHES LINE AND I FOUND AN OLD SACK AND PUT THEM IN IT AND WE WENT
DOWN AND GOT THE FOX FIRE AND PUT THAT IN TOO
I CALLED IT BORROWING
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT PAP ALWAYS CALLED IT BUT TOM SAID IT WARN'T
BORROWING IT WAS STEALING
HE SAID WE WAS REPRESENTING PRISONERS AND
PRISONERS DON'T CARE HOW THEY GET A THING SO THEY GET IT AND NOBODY
DON'T BLAME THEM FOR IT EITHER
IT AIN'T NO CRIME IN A PRISONER TO
STEAL THE THING HE NEEDS TO GET AWAY WITH TOM SAID IT'S HIS RIGHT AND
SO AS LONG AS WE WAS REPRESENTING A PRISONER WE HAD A PERFECT RIGHT TO
STEAL ANYTHING ON THIS PLACE WE HAD THE LEAST USE FOR TO GET OURSELVES
OUT OF PRISON WITH
HE SAID IF WE WARN'T PRISONERS IT WOULD BE A VERY
DIFFERENT THING AND NOBODY BUT A MEAN ORNERY PERSON WOULD STEAL WHEN
HE WARN'T A PRISONER
SO WE ALLOWED WE WOULD STEAL EVERYTHING THERE WAS
THAT COME HANDY
AND YET HE MADE A MIGHTY FUSS ONE DAY AFTER THAT
WHEN I STOLE A WATERMELON OUT OF THE NIGGER PATCH AND EAT IT AND HE
MADE ME GO AND GIVE THE NIGGERS A DIME WITHOUT TELLING THEM WHAT IT
WAS FOR
TOM SAID THAT WHAT HE MEANT WAS WE COULD STEAL ANYTHING WE
NEEDED
WELL I SAYS I NEEDED THE WATERMELON
BUT HE SAID I DIDN'T
NEED IT TO GET OUT OF PRISON WITH THERE'S WHERE THE DIFFERENCE WAS
HE SAID IF I'D A WANTED IT TO HIDE A KNIFE IN AND SMUGGLE IT TO JIM
TO KILL THE SENESKAL WITH IT WOULD A BEEN ALL RIGHT
SO I LET IT GO AT
THAT THOUGH I COULDN'T SEE NO ADVANTAGE IN MY REPRESENTING A PRISONER
IF I GOT TO SET DOWN AND CHAW OVER A LOT OF GOLD LEAF DISTINCTIONS LIKE
THAT EVERY TIME I SEE A CHANCE TO HOG A WATERMELON
WELL AS I WAS SAYING WE WAITED THAT MORNING TILL EVERYBODY WAS SETTLED
DOWN TO BUSINESS AND NOBODY IN SIGHT AROUND THE YARD THEN TOM HE
CARRIED THE SACK INTO THE LEAN TO WHILST I STOOD OFF A PIECE TO KEEP
WATCH
BY AND BY HE COME OUT AND WE WENT AND SET DOWN ON THE WOODPILE
TO TALK
HE SAYS
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT NOW EXCEPT TOOLS AND THAT'S EASY FIXED
TOOLS I SAYS
YES
TOOLS FOR WHAT
WHY TO DIG WITH
WE AIN'T A GOING TO GNAW HIM OUT ARE WE
AIN'T THEM OLD CRIPPLED PICKS AND THINGS IN THERE GOOD ENOUGH TO DIG A
NIGGER OUT WITH I SAYS
HE TURNS ON ME LOOKING PITYING ENOUGH TO MAKE A BODY CRY AND SAYS
HUCK FINN DID YOU EVER HEAR OF A PRISONER HAVING PICKS AND SHOVELS
AND ALL THE MODERN CONVENIENCES IN HIS WARDROBE TO DIG HIMSELF OUT WITH
NOW I WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU GOT ANY REASONABLENESS IN YOU AT ALL WHAT
KIND OF A SHOW WOULD THAT GIVE HIM TO BE A HERO WHY THEY MIGHT AS
WELL LEND HIM THE KEY AND DONE WITH IT
PICKS AND SHOVELS WHY THEY
WOULDN'T FURNISH 'EM TO A KING
WELL THEN I SAYS IF WE DON'T WANT THE PICKS AND SHOVELS WHAT DO
WE WANT
A COUPLE OF CASE KNIVES
TO DIG THE FOUNDATIONS OUT FROM UNDER THAT CABIN WITH
YES
CONFOUND IT IT'S FOOLISH TOM
IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE HOW FOOLISH IT IS IT'S THE RIGHT WAY AND
IT'S THE REGULAR WAY
AND THERE AIN'T NO OTHER WAY THAT EVER I HEARD
OF AND I'VE READ ALL THE BOOKS THAT GIVES ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THESE
THINGS
THEY ALWAYS DIG OUT WITH A CASE KNIFE AND NOT THROUGH DIRT MIND
YOU GENERLY IT'S THROUGH SOLID ROCK
AND IT TAKES THEM WEEKS AND WEEKS
AND WEEKS AND FOR EVER AND EVER
WHY LOOK AT ONE OF THEM PRISONERS IN
THE BOTTOM DUNGEON OF THE CASTLE DEEF IN THE HARBOR OF MARSEILLES THAT
DUG HIMSELF OUT THAT WAY HOW LONG WAS HE AT IT YOU RECKON
I DON'T KNOW
WELL GUESS
I DON'T KNOW
A MONTH AND A HALF
THIRTY SEVEN YEAR AND HE COME OUT IN CHINA
THAT'S THE KIND
I
WISH THE BOTTOM OF THIS FORTRESS WAS SOLID ROCK
JIM DON'T KNOW NOBODY IN CHINA
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT NEITHER DID THAT OTHER FELLOW
BUT
YOU'RE ALWAYS A WANDERING OFF ON A SIDE ISSUE
WHY CAN'T YOU STICK TO
THE MAIN POINT
ALL RIGHT I DON'T CARE WHERE HE COMES OUT SO HE COMES OUT AND JIM
DON'T EITHER I RECKON
BUT THERE'S ONE THING ANYWAY JIM'S TOO OLD TO
BE DUG OUT WITH A CASE KNIFE
HE WON'T LAST
YES HE WILL LAST TOO
YOU DON'T RECKON IT'S GOING TO TAKE
THIRTY SEVEN YEARS TO DIG OUT THROUGH A DIRT FOUNDATION DO YOU
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TOM
WELL WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG AS WE OUGHT TO BECAUSE IT MAYN'T
TAKE VERY LONG FOR UNCLE SILAS TO HEAR FROM DOWN THERE BY NEW ORLEANS
HE'LL HEAR JIM AIN'T FROM THERE
THEN HIS NEXT MOVE WILL BE TO
ADVERTISE JIM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
SO WE CAN'T RESK BEING AS LONG
DIGGING HIM OUT AS WE OUGHT TO
BY RIGHTS I RECKON WE OUGHT TO BE
A COUPLE OF YEARS BUT WE CAN'T
THINGS BEING SO UNCERTAIN WHAT I
RECOMMEND IS THIS THAT WE REALLY DIG RIGHT IN AS QUICK AS WE CAN
AND AFTER THAT WE CAN LET ON TO OURSELVES THAT WE WAS AT IT
THIRTY SEVEN YEARS
THEN WE CAN SNATCH HIM OUT AND RUSH HIM AWAY THE
FIRST TIME THERE'S AN ALARM
YES I RECKON THAT 'LL BE THE BEST WAY
NOW THERE'S SENSE IN THAT I SAYS
LETTING ON DON'T COST NOTHING
LETTING ON AIN'T NO TROUBLE AND IF IT'S ANY OBJECT I DON'T MIND
LETTING ON WE WAS AT IT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR
IT WOULDN'T STRAIN
ME NONE AFTER I GOT MY HAND IN
SO I'LL MOSEY ALONG NOW AND SMOUCH A
COUPLE OF CASE KNIVES
SMOUCH THREE HE SAYS WE WANT ONE TO MAKE A SAW OUT OF
TOM IF IT AIN'T UNREGULAR AND IRRELIGIOUS TO SEJEST IT I SAYS
THERE'S AN OLD RUSTY SAW BLADE AROUND YONDER STICKING UNDER THE
WEATHER BOARDING BEHIND THE SMOKE HOUSE
HE LOOKED KIND OF WEARY AND DISCOURAGED LIKE AND SAYS
IT AIN'T NO USE TO TRY TO LEARN YOU NOTHING HUCK
RUN ALONG AND
SMOUCH THE KNIVES THREE OF THEM SO I DONE IT
CHAPTER XXXVI
AS SOON AS WE RECKONED EVERYBODY WAS ASLEEP THAT NIGHT WE WENT DOWN THE
LIGHTNING ROD AND SHUT OURSELVES UP IN THE LEAN TO AND GOT OUT OUR
PILE OF FOX FIRE AND WENT TO WORK
WE CLEARED EVERYTHING OUT OF THE
WAY ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FOOT ALONG THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM LOG
TOM
SAID HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND JIM'S BED NOW AND WE'D DIG IN UNDER IT AND
WHEN WE GOT THROUGH THERE COULDN'T NOBODY IN THE CABIN EVER KNOW THERE
WAS ANY HOLE THERE BECAUSE JIM'S COUNTER PIN HUNG DOWN MOST TO THE
GROUND AND YOU'D HAVE TO RAISE IT UP AND LOOK UNDER TO SEE THE HOLE
SO WE DUG AND DUG WITH THE CASE KNIVES TILL MOST MIDNIGHT AND THEN
WE WAS DOG TIRED AND OUR HANDS WAS BLISTERED AND YET YOU COULDN'T SEE
WE'D DONE ANYTHING HARDLY
AT LAST I SAYS
THIS AIN'T NO THIRTY SEVEN YEAR JOB THIS IS A THIRTY EIGHT YEAR JOB
TOM SAWYER
HE NEVER SAID NOTHING
BUT HE SIGHED AND PRETTY SOON HE STOPPED
DIGGING AND THEN FOR A GOOD LITTLE WHILE I KNOWED THAT HE WAS THINKING
THEN HE SAYS
IT AIN'T NO USE HUCK IT AIN'T A GOING TO WORK
IF WE WAS PRISONERS
IT WOULD BECAUSE THEN WE'D HAVE AS MANY YEARS AS WE WANTED AND NO
HURRY AND WE WOULDN'T GET BUT A FEW MINUTES TO DIG EVERY DAY WHILE
THEY WAS CHANGING WATCHES AND SO OUR HANDS WOULDN'T GET BLISTERED AND
WE COULD KEEP IT UP RIGHT ALONG YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT AND DO IT RIGHT
AND THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE DONE
BUT WE CAN'T FOOL ALONG WE GOT TO
RUSH WE AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO SPARE
IF WE WAS TO PUT IN ANOTHER
NIGHT THIS WAY WE'D HAVE TO KNOCK OFF FOR A WEEK TO LET OUR HANDS GET
WELL COULDN'T TOUCH A CASE KNIFE WITH THEM SOONER
WELL THEN WHAT WE GOING TO DO TOM
I'LL TELL YOU
IT AIN'T RIGHT AND IT AIN'T MORAL AND I WOULDN'T LIKE
IT TO GET OUT BUT THERE AIN'T ONLY JUST THE ONE WAY WE GOT TO DIG HIM
OUT WITH THE PICKS AND LET ON IT'S CASE KNIVES
NOW YOU'RE TALKING I SAYS YOUR HEAD GETS LEVELER AND LEVELER
ALL THE TIME TOM SAWYER I SAYS
PICKS IS THE THING MORAL OR NO
MORAL AND AS FOR ME I DON'T CARE SHUCKS FOR THE MORALITY OF IT NOHOW
WHEN I START IN TO STEAL A NIGGER OR A WATERMELON OR A SUNDAY SCHOOL
BOOK I AIN'T NO WAYS PARTICULAR HOW IT'S DONE SO IT'S DONE
WHAT I
WANT IS MY NIGGER OR WHAT I WANT IS MY WATERMELON OR WHAT I WANT IS MY
SUNDAY SCHOOL BOOK AND IF A PICK'S THE HANDIEST THING THAT'S THE THING
I'M A GOING TO DIG THAT NIGGER OR THAT WATERMELON OR THAT SUNDAY SCHOOL
BOOK OUT WITH AND I DON'T GIVE A DEAD RAT WHAT THE AUTHORITIES THINKS
ABOUT IT NUTHER
WELL HE SAYS THERE'S EXCUSE FOR PICKS AND LETTING ON IN A CASE LIKE
THIS IF IT WARN'T SO I WOULDN'T APPROVE OF IT NOR I WOULDN'T STAND BY
AND SEE THE RULES BROKE BECAUSE RIGHT IS RIGHT AND WRONG IS WRONG
AND A BODY AIN'T GOT NO BUSINESS DOING WRONG WHEN HE AIN'T IGNORANT AND
KNOWS BETTER
IT MIGHT ANSWER FOR YOU TO DIG JIM OUT WITH A PICK
WITHOUT ANY LETTING ON BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW NO BETTER BUT IT
WOULDN'T FOR ME BECAUSE I DO KNOW BETTER
GIMME A CASE KNIFE
HE HAD HIS OWN BY HIM BUT I HANDED HIM MINE
HE FLUNG IT DOWN AND
SAYS
GIMME A CASE KNIFE
I DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO BUT THEN I THOUGHT
I SCRATCHED AROUND
AMONGST THE OLD TOOLS AND GOT A PICKAXE AND GIVE IT TO HIM AND HE TOOK
IT AND WENT TO WORK AND NEVER SAID A WORD
HE WAS ALWAYS JUST THAT PARTICULAR
FULL OF PRINCIPLE
SO THEN I GOT A SHOVEL AND THEN WE PICKED AND SHOVELED TURN ABOUT
AND MADE THE FUR FLY
WE STUCK TO IT ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR WHICH WAS AS
LONG AS WE COULD STAND UP BUT WE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF A HOLE TO SHOW FOR
IT
WHEN I GOT UP STAIRS I LOOKED OUT AT THE WINDOW AND SEE TOM DOING
HIS LEVEL BEST WITH THE LIGHTNING ROD BUT HE COULDN'T COME IT HIS
HANDS WAS SO SORE
AT LAST HE SAYS
IT AIN'T NO USE IT CAN'T BE DONE
WHAT YOU RECKON I BETTER DO CAN'T
YOU THINK OF NO WAY
YES I SAYS BUT I RECKON IT AIN'T REGULAR
COME UP THE STAIRS AND
LET ON IT'S A LIGHTNING ROD
SO HE DONE IT
NEXT DAY TOM STOLE A PEWTER SPOON AND A BRASS CANDLESTICK IN THE HOUSE
FOR TO MAKE SOME PENS FOR JIM OUT OF AND SIX TALLOW CANDLES AND I
HUNG AROUND THE NIGGER CABINS AND LAID FOR A CHANCE AND STOLE THREE TIN
PLATES
TOM SAYS IT WASN'T ENOUGH BUT I SAID NOBODY WOULDN'T EVER SEE
THE PLATES THAT JIM THROWED OUT BECAUSE THEY'D FALL IN THE DOG FENNEL
AND JIMPSON WEEDS UNDER THE WINDOW HOLE THEN WE COULD TOTE THEM BACK AND
HE COULD USE THEM OVER AGAIN
SO TOM WAS SATISFIED
THEN HE SAYS
NOW THE THING TO STUDY OUT IS HOW TO GET THE THINGS TO JIM
TAKE THEM IN THROUGH THE HOLE I SAYS WHEN WE GET IT DONE
HE ONLY JUST LOOKED SCORNFUL AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT NOBODY EVER HEARD
OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC IDEA AND THEN HE WENT TO STUDYING
BY AND BY HE
SAID HE HAD CIPHERED OUT TWO OR THREE WAYS BUT THERE WARN'T NO NEED TO
DECIDE ON ANY OF THEM YET
SAID WE'D GOT TO POST JIM FIRST
THAT NIGHT WE WENT DOWN THE LIGHTNING ROD A LITTLE AFTER TEN AND TOOK
ONE OF THE CANDLES ALONG AND LISTENED UNDER THE WINDOW HOLE AND HEARD
JIM SNORING SO WE PITCHED IT IN AND IT DIDN'T WAKE HIM
THEN WE
WHIRLED IN WITH THE PICK AND SHOVEL AND IN ABOUT TWO HOURS AND A HALF
THE JOB WAS DONE
WE CREPT IN UNDER JIM'S BED AND INTO THE CABIN AND
PAWED AROUND AND FOUND THE CANDLE AND LIT IT AND STOOD OVER JIM AWHILE
AND FOUND HIM LOOKING HEARTY AND HEALTHY AND THEN WE WOKE HIM UP GENTLE
AND GRADUAL
HE WAS SO GLAD TO SEE US HE MOST CRIED AND CALLED US
HONEY AND ALL THE PET NAMES HE COULD THINK OF AND WAS FOR HAVING US
HUNT UP A COLD CHISEL TO CUT THE CHAIN OFF OF HIS LEG WITH RIGHT AWAY
AND CLEARING OUT WITHOUT LOSING ANY TIME
BUT TOM HE SHOWED HIM HOW
UNREGULAR IT WOULD BE AND SET DOWN AND TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT OUR PLANS
AND HOW WE COULD ALTER THEM IN A MINUTE ANY TIME THERE WAS AN ALARM AND
NOT TO BE THE LEAST AFRAID BECAUSE WE WOULD SEE HE GOT AWAY SURE
SO JIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND WE SET THERE AND TALKED OVER OLD
TIMES AWHILE AND THEN TOM ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND WHEN JIM TOLD
HIM UNCLE SILAS COME IN EVERY DAY OR TWO TO PRAY WITH HIM AND AUNT
SALLY COME IN TO SEE IF HE WAS COMFORTABLE AND HAD PLENTY TO EAT AND
BOTH OF THEM WAS KIND AS THEY COULD BE TOM SAYS
NOW I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT
WE'LL SEND YOU SOME THINGS BY THEM
I SAID DON'T DO NOTHING OF THE KIND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST JACKASS
IDEAS I EVER STRUCK BUT HE NEVER PAID NO ATTENTION TO ME WENT RIGHT
ON
IT WAS HIS WAY WHEN HE'D GOT HIS PLANS SET
SO HE TOLD JIM HOW WE'D HAVE TO SMUGGLE IN THE ROPE LADDER PIE AND OTHER
LARGE THINGS BY NAT THE NIGGER THAT FED HIM AND HE MUST BE ON THE
LOOKOUT AND NOT BE SURPRISED AND NOT LET NAT SEE HIM OPEN THEM AND
WE WOULD PUT SMALL THINGS IN UNCLE'S COAT POCKETS AND HE MUST STEAL THEM
OUT AND WE WOULD TIE THINGS TO AUNT'S APRON STRINGS OR PUT THEM IN HER
APRON POCKET IF WE GOT A CHANCE AND TOLD HIM WHAT THEY WOULD BE AND
WHAT THEY WAS FOR
AND TOLD HIM HOW TO KEEP A JOURNAL ON THE SHIRT WITH
HIS BLOOD AND ALL THAT
HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
JIM HE COULDN'T SEE
NO SENSE IN THE MOST OF IT BUT HE ALLOWED WE WAS WHITE FOLKS AND KNOWED
BETTER THAN HIM SO HE WAS SATISFIED AND SAID HE WOULD DO IT ALL JUST
AS TOM SAID
JIM HAD PLENTY CORN COB PIPES AND TOBACCO SO WE HAD A RIGHT DOWN GOOD
SOCIABLE TIME THEN WE CRAWLED OUT THROUGH THE HOLE AND SO HOME TO
BED WITH HANDS THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY'D BEEN CHAWED
TOM WAS IN HIGH
SPIRITS
HE SAID IT WAS THE BEST FUN HE EVER HAD IN HIS LIFE AND THE
MOST INTELLECTURAL AND SAID IF HE ONLY COULD SEE HIS WAY TO IT WE WOULD
KEEP IT UP ALL THE REST OF OUR LIVES AND LEAVE JIM TO OUR CHILDREN TO
GET OUT FOR HE BELIEVED JIM WOULD COME TO LIKE IT BETTER AND BETTER THE
MORE HE GOT USED TO IT
HE SAID THAT IN THAT WAY IT COULD BE STRUNG OUT
TO AS MUCH AS EIGHTY YEAR AND WOULD BE THE BEST TIME ON RECORD
AND HE
SAID IT WOULD MAKE US ALL CELEBRATED THAT HAD A HAND IN IT
IN THE MORNING WE WENT OUT TO THE WOODPILE AND CHOPPED UP THE BRASS
CANDLESTICK INTO HANDY SIZES AND TOM PUT THEM AND THE PEWTER SPOON IN
HIS POCKET
THEN WE WENT TO THE NIGGER CABINS AND WHILE I GOT NAT'S
NOTICE OFF TOM SHOVED A PIECE OF CANDLESTICK INTO THE MIDDLE OF A
CORN PONE THAT WAS IN JIM'S PAN AND WE WENT ALONG WITH NAT TO SEE HOW
IT WOULD WORK AND IT JUST WORKED NOBLE WHEN JIM BIT INTO IT IT MOST
MASHED ALL HIS TEETH OUT AND THERE WARN'T EVER ANYTHING COULD A WORKED
BETTER
TOM SAID SO HIMSELF
JIM HE NEVER LET ON BUT WHAT IT WAS ONLY
JUST A PIECE OF ROCK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S ALWAYS GETTING INTO
BREAD YOU KNOW BUT AFTER THAT HE NEVER BIT INTO NOTHING BUT WHAT HE
JABBED HIS FORK INTO IT IN THREE OR FOUR PLACES FIRST
AND WHILST WE WAS A STANDING THERE IN THE DIMMISH LIGHT HERE COMES A
COUPLE OF THE HOUNDS BULGING IN FROM UNDER JIM'S BED AND THEY KEPT ON
PILING IN TILL THERE WAS ELEVEN OF THEM AND THERE WARN'T HARDLY ROOM
IN THERE TO GET YOUR BREATH
BY JINGS WE FORGOT TO FASTEN THAT LEAN TO
DOOR THE NIGGER NAT HE ONLY JUST HOLLERED WITCHES ONCE AND KEELED
OVER ON TO THE FLOOR AMONGST THE DOGS AND BEGUN TO GROAN LIKE HE WAS
DYING
TOM JERKED THE DOOR OPEN AND FLUNG OUT A SLAB OF JIM'S MEAT
AND THE DOGS WENT FOR IT AND IN TWO SECONDS HE WAS OUT HIMSELF AND BACK
AGAIN AND SHUT THE DOOR AND I KNOWED HE'D FIXED THE OTHER DOOR TOO
THEN HE WENT TO WORK ON THE NIGGER COAXING HIM AND PETTING HIM AND
ASKING HIM IF HE'D BEEN IMAGINING HE SAW SOMETHING AGAIN
HE RAISED UP
AND BLINKED HIS EYES AROUND AND SAYS
MARS SID YOU'LL SAY I'S A FOOL BUT IF I DIDN'T B'LIEVE I SEE MOST A
MILLION DOGS ER DEVILS ER SOME'N I WISHT I MAY DIE RIGHT HEAH IN DESE

CHAPTER XXXVII
THAT WAS ALL FIXED
SO THEN WE WENT AWAY AND WENT TO THE RUBBAGE PILE
IN THE BACK YARD WHERE THEY KEEP THE OLD BOOTS AND RAGS AND PIECES
OF BOTTLES AND WORE OUT TIN THINGS AND ALL SUCH TRUCK AND SCRATCHED
AROUND AND FOUND AN OLD TIN WASHPAN AND STOPPED UP THE HOLES AS WELL AS
WE COULD TO BAKE THE PIE IN AND TOOK IT DOWN CELLAR AND STOLE IT FULL
OF FLOUR AND STARTED FOR BREAKFAST AND FOUND A COUPLE OF SHINGLE NAILS
THAT TOM SAID WOULD BE HANDY FOR A PRISONER TO SCRABBLE HIS NAME AND
SORROWS ON THE DUNGEON WALLS WITH AND DROPPED ONE OF THEM IN AUNT
SALLY'S APRON POCKET WHICH WAS HANGING ON A CHAIR AND T'OTHER WE STUCK
IN THE BAND OF UNCLE SILAS'S HAT WHICH WAS ON THE BUREAU BECAUSE WE
HEARD THE CHILDREN SAY THEIR PA AND MA WAS GOING TO THE RUNAWAY NIGGER'S
HOUSE THIS MORNING AND THEN WENT TO BREAKFAST AND TOM DROPPED THE
PEWTER SPOON IN UNCLE SILAS'S COAT POCKET AND AUNT SALLY WASN'T COME
YET SO WE HAD TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE
AND WHEN SHE COME SHE WAS HOT AND RED AND CROSS AND COULDN'T HARDLY
WAIT FOR THE BLESSING AND THEN SHE WENT TO SLUICING OUT COFFEE WITH ONE
HAND AND CRACKING THE HANDIEST CHILD'S HEAD WITH HER THIMBLE WITH THE
OTHER AND SAYS
I'VE HUNTED HIGH AND I'VE HUNTED LOW AND IT DOES BEAT ALL WHAT HAS
BECOME OF YOUR OTHER SHIRT
MY HEART FELL DOWN AMONGST MY LUNGS AND LIVERS AND THINGS AND A HARD
PIECE OF CORN CRUST STARTED DOWN MY THROAT AFTER IT AND GOT MET ON THE
ROAD WITH A COUGH AND WAS SHOT ACROSS THE TABLE AND TOOK ONE OF THE
CHILDREN IN THE EYE AND CURLED HIM UP LIKE A FISHING WORM AND LET A CRY
OUT OF HIM THE SIZE OF A WARWHOOP AND TOM HE TURNED KINDER BLUE AROUND
THE GILLS AND IT ALL AMOUNTED TO A CONSIDERABLE STATE OF THINGS FOR
ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MINUTE OR AS MUCH AS THAT AND I WOULD A SOLD OUT
FOR HALF PRICE IF THERE WAS A BIDDER
BUT AFTER THAT WE WAS ALL RIGHT
AGAIN IT WAS THE SUDDEN SURPRISE OF IT THAT KNOCKED US SO KIND OF COLD
UNCLE SILAS HE SAYS
IT'S MOST UNCOMMON CURIOUS I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT
I KNOW PERFECTLY
WELL I TOOK IT OFF BECAUSE
BECAUSE YOU HAIN'T GOT BUT ONE ON
JUST LISTEN AT THE MAN I KNOW
YOU TOOK IT OFF AND KNOW IT BY A BETTER WAY THAN YOUR WOOL GETHERING
MEMORY TOO BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE CLO'S LINE YESTERDAY I SEE IT THERE
MYSELF
BUT IT'S GONE THAT'S THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT AND YOU'LL
JUST HAVE TO CHANGE TO A RED FLANN'L ONE TILL I CAN GET TIME TO MAKE A
NEW ONE
AND IT 'LL BE THE THIRD I'VE MADE IN TWO YEARS
IT JUST KEEPS
A BODY ON THE JUMP TO KEEP YOU IN SHIRTS AND WHATEVER YOU DO MANAGE TO
DO WITH 'M ALL IS MORE'N I CAN MAKE OUT
A BODY 'D THINK YOU WOULD
LEARN TO TAKE SOME SORT OF CARE OF 'EM AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE
I KNOW IT SALLY AND I DO TRY ALL I CAN
BUT IT OUGHTN'T TO BE
ALTOGETHER MY FAULT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE THEM NOR HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM EXCEPT WHEN THEY'RE ON ME AND I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE EVER LOST ONE OF THEM OFF OF ME
WELL IT AIN'T YOUR FAULT IF YOU HAVEN'T SILAS YOU'D A DONE IT
IF YOU COULD I RECKON
AND THE SHIRT AIN'T ALL THAT'S GONE NUTHER
THER'S A SPOON GONE AND THAT AIN'T ALL
THERE WAS TEN AND NOW
THER'S ONLY NINE
THE CALF GOT THE SHIRT I RECKON BUT THE CALF NEVER
TOOK THE SPOON THAT'S CERTAIN
WHY WHAT ELSE IS GONE SALLY
THER'S SIX CANDLES GONE THAT'S WHAT
THE RATS COULD A GOT THE
CANDLES AND I RECKON THEY DID I WONDER THEY DON'T WALK OFF WITH THE
WHOLE PLACE THE WAY YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO STOP THEIR HOLES AND DON'T
DO IT AND IF THEY WARN'T FOOLS THEY'D SLEEP IN YOUR HAIR SILAS YOU'D
NEVER FIND IT OUT BUT YOU CAN'T LAY THE SPOON ON THE RATS AND THAT I
KNOW
WELL SALLY I'M IN FAULT AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT I'VE BEEN REMISS BUT
I WON'T LET TO MORROW GO BY WITHOUT STOPPING UP THEM HOLES

MATILDA ANGELINA ARAMINTA
PHELPS
WHACK COMES THE THIMBLE AND THE CHILD SNATCHES HER CLAWS OUT OF THE
SUGAR BOWL WITHOUT FOOLING AROUND ANY
JUST THEN THE NIGGER WOMAN STEPS

MISS'N
CLER OUT FROM HERE YOU HUSSY ER I'LL TAKE A SKILLET TO YE
WELL SHE WAS JUST A BILING
I BEGUN TO LAY FOR A CHANCE I RECKONED
I WOULD SNEAK OUT AND GO FOR THE WOODS TILL THE WEATHER MODERATED
SHE
KEPT A RAGING RIGHT ALONG RUNNING HER INSURRECTION ALL BY HERSELF AND
EVERYBODY ELSE MIGHTY MEEK AND QUIET AND AT LAST UNCLE SILAS LOOKING
KIND OF FOOLISH FISHES UP THAT SPOON OUT OF HIS POCKET
SHE STOPPED
WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER HANDS UP AND AS FOR ME I WISHED I WAS IN
JERUSLEM OR SOMEWHERES
BUT NOT LONG BECAUSE SHE SAYS
IT'S JUST AS I EXPECTED
SO YOU HAD IT IN YOUR POCKET ALL THE TIME
AND LIKE AS NOT YOU'VE GOT THE OTHER THINGS THERE TOO
HOW'D IT GET
THERE
I REELY DON'T KNOW SALLY HE SAYS KIND OF APOLOGIZING OR YOU KNOW
I WOULD TELL
I WAS A STUDYING OVER MY TEXT IN ACTS SEVENTEEN BEFORE
BREAKFAST AND I RECKON I PUT IT IN THERE NOT NOTICING MEANING TO PUT
MY TESTAMENT IN AND IT MUST BE SO BECAUSE MY TESTAMENT AIN'T IN BUT
I'LL GO AND SEE AND IF THE TESTAMENT IS WHERE I HAD IT I'LL KNOW I
DIDN'T PUT IT IN AND THAT WILL SHOW THAT I LAID THE TESTAMENT DOWN AND
TOOK UP THE SPOON AND
OH FOR THE LAND'S SAKE GIVE A BODY A REST GO 'LONG NOW THE WHOLE
KIT AND BILING OF YE AND DON'T COME NIGH ME AGAIN TILL I'VE GOT BACK MY
PEACE OF MIND
I'D A HEARD HER IF SHE'D A SAID IT TO HERSELF LET ALONE SPEAKING IT
OUT AND I'D A GOT UP AND OBEYED HER IF I'D A BEEN DEAD
AS WE WAS
PASSING THROUGH THE SETTING ROOM THE OLD MAN HE TOOK UP HIS HAT AND THE
SHINGLE NAIL FELL OUT ON THE FLOOR AND HE JUST MERELY PICKED IT UP AND
LAID IT ON THE MANTEL SHELF AND NEVER SAID NOTHING AND WENT OUT
TOM
SEE HIM DO IT AND REMEMBERED ABOUT THE SPOON AND SAYS
WELL IT AIN'T NO USE TO SEND THINGS BY HIM NO MORE HE AIN'T
RELIABLE THEN HE SAYS BUT HE DONE US A GOOD TURN WITH THE SPOON
ANYWAY WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND SO WE'LL GO AND DO HIM ONE WITHOUT HIM
KNOWING IT STOP UP HIS RAT HOLES
THERE WAS A NOBLE GOOD LOT OF THEM DOWN CELLAR AND IT TOOK US A WHOLE
HOUR BUT WE DONE THE JOB TIGHT AND GOOD AND SHIPSHAPE
THEN WE HEARD
STEPS ON THE STAIRS AND BLOWED OUT OUR LIGHT AND HID AND HERE COMES
THE OLD MAN WITH A CANDLE IN ONE HAND AND A BUNDLE OF STUFF IN T'OTHER
LOOKING AS ABSENT MINDED AS YEAR BEFORE LAST
HE WENT A MOONING AROUND
FIRST TO ONE RAT HOLE AND THEN ANOTHER TILL HE'D BEEN TO THEM ALL
THEN HE STOOD ABOUT FIVE MINUTES PICKING TALLOW DRIP OFF OF HIS CANDLE
AND THINKING
THEN HE TURNS OFF SLOW AND DREAMY TOWARDS THE STAIRS
SAYING
WELL FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN I DONE IT
I COULD
SHOW HER NOW THAT I WARN'T TO BLAME ON ACCOUNT OF THE RATS
BUT NEVER
MIND LET IT GO
I RECKON IT WOULDN'T DO NO GOOD
AND SO HE WENT ON A MUMBLING UP STAIRS AND THEN WE LEFT
HE WAS A
MIGHTY NICE OLD MAN
AND ALWAYS IS
TOM WAS A GOOD DEAL BOTHERED ABOUT WHAT TO DO FOR A SPOON BUT HE SAID
WE'D GOT TO HAVE IT SO HE TOOK A THINK
WHEN HE HAD CIPHERED IT OUT
HE TOLD ME HOW WE WAS TO DO THEN WE WENT AND WAITED AROUND THE
SPOON BASKET TILL WE SEE AUNT SALLY COMING AND THEN TOM WENT TO
COUNTING THE SPOONS AND LAYING THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND I SLID ONE OF
THEM UP MY SLEEVE AND TOM SAYS
WHY AUNT SALLY THERE AIN'T BUT NINE SPOONS YET
SHE SAYS
GO 'LONG TO YOUR PLAY AND DON'T BOTHER ME
I KNOW BETTER I COUNTED
'M MYSELF
WELL I'VE COUNTED THEM TWICE AUNTY AND I CAN'T MAKE BUT NINE
SHE LOOKED OUT OF ALL PATIENCE BUT OF COURSE SHE COME TO COUNT ANYBODY
WOULD
I DECLARE TO GRACIOUS THER' AIN'T BUT NINE SHE SAYS
WHY WHAT IN
THE WORLD PLAGUE TAKE THE THINGS I'LL COUNT 'M AGAIN
SO I SLIPPED BACK THE ONE I HAD AND WHEN SHE GOT DONE COUNTING SHE
SAYS
HANG THE TROUBLESOME RUBBAGE THER'S TEN NOW AND SHE LOOKED HUFFY
AND BOTHERED BOTH
BUT TOM SAYS
WHY AUNTY I DON'T THINK THERE'S TEN
YOU NUMSKULL DIDN'T YOU SEE ME COUNT 'M
I KNOW BUT
WELL I'LL COUNT 'M AGAIN
SO I SMOUCHED ONE AND THEY COME OUT NINE SAME AS THE OTHER TIME
WELL SHE WAS IN A TEARING WAY JUST A TREMBLING ALL OVER SHE WAS SO
MAD
BUT SHE COUNTED AND COUNTED TILL SHE GOT THAT ADDLED SHE'D START
TO COUNT IN THE BASKET FOR A SPOON SOMETIMES AND SO THREE TIMES THEY
COME OUT RIGHT AND THREE TIMES THEY COME OUT WRONG
THEN SHE GRABBED
UP THE BASKET AND SLAMMED IT ACROSS THE HOUSE AND KNOCKED THE CAT
GALLEY WEST AND SHE SAID CLE'R OUT AND LET HER HAVE SOME PEACE AND IF
WE COME BOTHERING AROUND HER AGAIN BETWIXT THAT AND DINNER SHE'D SKIN
US
SO WE HAD THE ODD SPOON AND DROPPED IT IN HER APRON POCKET WHILST
SHE WAS A GIVING US OUR SAILING ORDERS AND JIM GOT IT ALL RIGHT ALONG
WITH HER SHINGLE NAIL BEFORE NOON
WE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH
THIS BUSINESS AND TOM ALLOWED IT WAS WORTH TWICE THE TROUBLE IT TOOK
BECAUSE HE SAID NOW SHE COULDN'T EVER COUNT THEM SPOONS TWICE ALIKE
AGAIN TO SAVE HER LIFE AND WOULDN'T BELIEVE SHE'D COUNTED THEM RIGHT IF
SHE DID AND SAID THAT AFTER SHE'D ABOUT COUNTED HER HEAD OFF FOR THE
NEXT THREE DAYS HE JUDGED SHE'D GIVE IT UP AND OFFER TO KILL ANYBODY
THAT WANTED HER TO EVER COUNT THEM ANY MORE
SO WE PUT THE SHEET BACK ON THE LINE THAT NIGHT AND STOLE ONE OUT OF
HER CLOSET AND KEPT ON PUTTING IT BACK AND STEALING IT AGAIN FOR A
COUPLE OF DAYS TILL SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY SHEETS SHE HAD ANY MORE
AND SHE DIDN'T CARE AND WARN'T A GOING TO BULLYRAG THE REST OF HER
SOUL OUT ABOUT IT AND WOULDN'T COUNT THEM AGAIN NOT TO SAVE HER LIFE
SHE DRUTHER DIE FIRST
SO WE WAS ALL RIGHT NOW AS TO THE SHIRT AND THE SHEET AND THE SPOON
AND THE CANDLES BY THE HELP OF THE CALF AND THE RATS AND THE MIXED UP
COUNTING AND AS TO THE CANDLESTICK IT WARN'T NO CONSEQUENCE IT WOULD
BLOW OVER BY AND BY
BUT THAT PIE WAS A JOB WE HAD NO END OF TROUBLE WITH THAT PIE
WE
FIXED IT UP AWAY DOWN IN THE WOODS AND COOKED IT THERE AND WE GOT IT
DONE AT LAST AND VERY SATISFACTORY TOO BUT NOT ALL IN ONE DAY AND WE
HAD TO USE UP THREE WASH PANS FULL OF FLOUR BEFORE WE GOT THROUGH AND
WE GOT BURNT PRETTY MUCH ALL OVER IN PLACES AND EYES PUT OUT WITH
THE SMOKE BECAUSE YOU SEE WE DIDN'T WANT NOTHING BUT A CRUST AND WE
COULDN'T PROP IT UP RIGHT AND SHE WOULD ALWAYS CAVE IN
BUT OF COURSE
WE THOUGHT OF THE RIGHT WAY AT LAST WHICH WAS TO COOK THE LADDER TOO
IN THE PIE
SO THEN WE LAID IN WITH JIM THE SECOND NIGHT AND TORE
UP THE SHEET ALL IN LITTLE STRINGS AND TWISTED THEM TOGETHER AND LONG
BEFORE DAYLIGHT WE HAD A LOVELY ROPE THAT YOU COULD A HUNG A PERSON
WITH
WE LET ON IT TOOK NINE MONTHS TO MAKE IT
AND IN THE FORENOON WE TOOK IT DOWN TO THE WOODS BUT IT WOULDN'T GO
INTO THE PIE
BEING MADE OF A WHOLE SHEET THAT WAY THERE WAS ROPE
ENOUGH FOR FORTY PIES IF WE'D A WANTED THEM AND PLENTY LEFT OVER
FOR SOUP OR SAUSAGE OR ANYTHING YOU CHOOSE
WE COULD A HAD A WHOLE
DINNER
BUT WE DIDN'T NEED IT
ALL WE NEEDED WAS JUST ENOUGH FOR THE PIE AND
SO WE THROWED THE REST AWAY
WE DIDN'T COOK NONE OF THE PIES IN THE
WASH PAN AFRAID THE SOLDER WOULD MELT BUT UNCLE SILAS HE HAD A NOBLE
BRASS WARMING PAN WHICH HE THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE OF BECAUSE IT BELONGED
TO ONE OF HIS ANCESTERS WITH A LONG WOODEN HANDLE THAT COME OVER FROM
ENGLAND WITH WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR IN THE MAYFLOWER OR ONE OF THEM EARLY
SHIPS AND WAS HID AWAY UP GARRET WITH A LOT OF OTHER OLD POTS AND THINGS
THAT WAS VALUABLE NOT ON ACCOUNT OF BEING ANY ACCOUNT BECAUSE THEY
WARN'T BUT ON ACCOUNT OF THEM BEING RELICTS YOU KNOW AND WE SNAKED
HER OUT PRIVATE AND TOOK HER DOWN THERE BUT SHE FAILED ON THE FIRST
PIES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW BUT SHE COME UP SMILING ON THE LAST
ONE
WE TOOK AND LINED HER WITH DOUGH AND SET HER IN THE COALS AND
LOADED HER UP WITH RAG ROPE AND PUT ON A DOUGH ROOF AND SHUT DOWN THE
LID AND PUT HOT EMBERS ON TOP AND STOOD OFF FIVE FOOT WITH THE LONG
HANDLE COOL AND COMFORTABLE AND IN FIFTEEN MINUTES SHE TURNED OUT A
PIE THAT WAS A SATISFACTION TO LOOK AT
BUT THE PERSON THAT ET IT WOULD
WANT TO FETCH A COUPLE OF KAGS OF TOOTHPICKS ALONG FOR IF THAT ROPE
LADDER WOULDN'T CRAMP HIM DOWN TO BUSINESS I DON'T KNOW NOTHING WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT AND LAY HIM IN ENOUGH STOMACH ACHE TO LAST HIM TILL NEXT
TIME TOO
NAT DIDN'T LOOK WHEN WE PUT THE WITCH PIE IN JIM'S PAN AND WE PUT THE
THREE TIN PLATES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN UNDER THE VITTLES AND SO JIM
GOT EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT AND AS SOON AS HE WAS BY HIMSELF HE BUSTED
INTO THE PIE AND HID THE ROPE LADDER INSIDE OF HIS STRAW TICK
AND SCRATCHED SOME MARKS ON A TIN PLATE AND THROWED IT OUT OF THE
WINDOW HOLE
CHAPTER XXXVIII
MAKING THEM PENS WAS A DISTRESSID TOUGH JOB AND SO WAS THE SAW AND JIM
ALLOWED THE INSCRIPTION WAS GOING TO BE THE TOUGHEST OF ALL
THAT'S THE
ONE WHICH THE PRISONER HAS TO SCRABBLE ON THE WALL
BUT HE HAD TO HAVE

OF ARMS BECAUSE HE HAIN'T
I RECKON I KNOWED THAT TOM SAYS BUT YOU BET HE'LL HAVE ONE BEFORE
HE GOES OUT OF THIS BECAUSE HE'S GOING OUT RIGHT AND THERE AIN'T
GOING TO BE NO FLAWS IN HIS RECORD

TOM SET TO WORK TO THINK OUT THE COAT OF ARMS
BY AND BY HE SAID HE'D

HE SAYS

MURREY IN THE FESS WITH A DOG COUCHANT FOR COMMON CHARGE AND UNDER
HIS FOOT A CHAIN EMBATTLED FOR SLAVERY WITH A CHEVRON VERT IN A
CHIEF ENGRAILED AND THREE INVECTED LINES ON A FIELD AZURE WITH THE
NOMBRIL POINTS RAMPANT ON A DANCETTE INDENTED CREST A RUNAWAY NIGGER
SABLE WITH HIS BUNDLE OVER HIS SHOULDER ON A BAR SINISTER AND A
COUPLE OF GULES FOR SUPPORTERS WHICH IS YOU AND ME MOTTO MAGGIORE
FRETTA MINORE OTTO GOT IT OUT OF A BOOK MEANS THE MORE HASTE THE
LESS SPEED
GEEWHILLIKINS I SAYS BUT WHAT DOES THE REST OF IT MEAN
WE AIN'T GOT NO TIME TO BOTHER OVER THAT HE SAYS WE GOT TO DIG IN
LIKE ALL GIT OUT
WELL ANYWAY I SAYS WHAT'S SOME OF IT WHAT'S A FESS
A FESS A FESS IS YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT A FESS IS
I'LL SHOW
HIM HOW TO MAKE IT WHEN HE GETS TO IT
SHUCKS TOM I SAYS I THINK YOU MIGHT TELL A PERSON
WHAT'S A BAR
SINISTER
OH I DON'T KNOW
BUT HE'S GOT TO HAVE IT
ALL THE NOBILITY DOES
THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY
IF IT DIDN'T SUIT HIM TO EXPLAIN A THING TO YOU
HE WOULDN'T DO IT
YOU MIGHT PUMP AT HIM A WEEK IT WOULDN'T MAKE NO
DIFFERENCE
HE'D GOT ALL THAT COAT OF ARMS BUSINESS FIXED SO NOW HE STARTED IN TO
FINISH UP THE REST OF THAT PART OF THE WORK WHICH WAS TO PLAN OUT A
MOURNFUL INSCRIPTION SAID JIM GOT TO HAVE ONE LIKE THEY ALL DONE
HE
MADE UP A LOT AND WROTE THEM OUT ON A PAPER AND READ THEM OFF SO
1
HERE A CAPTIVE HEART BUSTED
2
HERE A POOR PRISONER FORSOOK BY
THE WORLD AND FRIENDS FRETTED HIS SORROWFUL LIFE
3
HERE A LONELY
HEART BROKE AND A WORN SPIRIT WENT TO ITS REST AFTER THIRTY SEVEN
YEARS OF SOLITARY CAPTIVITY
4
HERE HOMELESS AND FRIENDLESS AFTER
THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OF BITTER CAPTIVITY PERISHED A NOBLE STRANGER
NATURAL SON OF LOUIS XIV
TOM'S VOICE TREMBLED WHILST HE WAS READING THEM AND HE MOST BROKE DOWN
WHEN HE GOT DONE HE COULDN'T NO WAY MAKE UP HIS MIND WHICH ONE FOR JIM
TO SCRABBLE ON TO THE WALL THEY WAS ALL SO GOOD BUT AT LAST HE ALLOWED
HE WOULD LET HIM SCRABBLE THEM ALL ON
JIM SAID IT WOULD TAKE HIM A
YEAR TO SCRABBLE SUCH A LOT OF TRUCK ON TO THE LOGS WITH A NAIL AND HE
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE LETTERS BESIDES BUT TOM SAID HE WOULD BLOCK
THEM OUT FOR HIM AND THEN HE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT JUST
FOLLOW THE LINES
THEN PRETTY SOON HE SAYS
COME TO THINK THE LOGS AIN'T A GOING TO DO THEY DON'T HAVE LOG WALLS
IN A DUNGEON WE GOT TO DIG THE INSCRIPTIONS INTO A ROCK
WE'LL FETCH
A ROCK
JIM SAID THE ROCK WAS WORSE THAN THE LOGS HE SAID IT WOULD TAKE HIM
SUCH A PISON LONG TIME TO DIG THEM INTO A ROCK HE WOULDN'T EVER GET OUT
BUT TOM SAID HE WOULD LET ME HELP HIM DO IT
THEN HE TOOK A LOOK TO
SEE HOW ME AND JIM WAS GETTING ALONG WITH THE PENS
IT WAS MOST PESKY
TEDIOUS HARD WORK AND SLOW AND DIDN'T GIVE MY HANDS NO SHOW TO GET
WELL OF THE SORES AND WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE NO HEADWAY HARDLY SO TOM
SAYS
I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT
WE GOT TO HAVE A ROCK FOR THE COAT OF ARMS AND
MOURNFUL INSCRIPTIONS AND WE CAN KILL TWO BIRDS WITH THAT SAME ROCK
THERE'S A GAUDY BIG GRINDSTONE DOWN AT THE MILL AND WE'LL SMOUCH IT
AND CARVE THE THINGS ON IT AND FILE OUT THE PENS AND THE SAW ON IT
TOO
IT WARN'T NO SLOUCH OF AN IDEA AND IT WARN'T NO SLOUCH OF A GRINDSTONE
NUTHER BUT WE ALLOWED WE'D TACKLE IT
IT WARN'T QUITE MIDNIGHT YET
SO WE CLEARED OUT FOR THE MILL LEAVING JIM AT WORK
WE SMOUCHED THE
GRINDSTONE AND SET OUT TO ROLL HER HOME BUT IT WAS A MOST NATION TOUGH
JOB
SOMETIMES DO WHAT WE COULD WE COULDN'T KEEP HER FROM FALLING
OVER AND SHE COME MIGHTY NEAR MASHING US EVERY TIME
TOM SAID SHE WAS
GOING TO GET ONE OF US SURE BEFORE WE GOT THROUGH
WE GOT HER HALF
WAY AND THEN WE WAS PLUMB PLAYED OUT AND MOST DROWNDED WITH SWEAT
WE
SEE IT WARN'T NO USE WE GOT TO GO AND FETCH JIM
SO HE RAISED UP HIS
BED AND SLID THE CHAIN OFF OF THE BED LEG AND WRAPT IT ROUND AND ROUND
HIS NECK AND WE CRAWLED OUT THROUGH OUR HOLE AND DOWN THERE AND JIM
AND ME LAID INTO THAT GRINDSTONE AND WALKED HER ALONG LIKE NOTHING AND
TOM SUPERINTENDED
HE COULD OUT SUPERINTEND ANY BOY I EVER SEE
HE
KNOWED HOW TO DO EVERYTHING
OUR HOLE WAS PRETTY BIG BUT IT WARN'T BIG ENOUGH TO GET THE GRINDSTONE
THROUGH BUT JIM HE TOOK THE PICK AND SOON MADE IT BIG ENOUGH
THEN TOM
MARKED OUT THEM THINGS ON IT WITH THE NAIL AND SET JIM TO WORK ON THEM
WITH THE NAIL FOR A CHISEL AND AN IRON BOLT FROM THE RUBBAGE IN THE
LEAN TO FOR A HAMMER AND TOLD HIM TO WORK TILL THE REST OF HIS CANDLE
QUIT ON HIM AND THEN HE COULD GO TO BED AND HIDE THE GRINDSTONE UNDER
HIS STRAW TICK AND SLEEP ON IT
THEN WE HELPED HIM FIX HIS CHAIN BACK
ON THE BED LEG AND WAS READY FOR BED OURSELVES
BUT TOM THOUGHT OF

TO SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU
YES YOU'RE ALL RIGHT YOU'RE FIXED

EVER CRY
SO TOM WAS STUMPED
BUT HE STUDIED IT OVER AND THEN SAID JIM WOULD
HAVE TO WORRY ALONG THE BEST HE COULD WITH AN ONION
HE PROMISED
HE WOULD GO TO THE NIGGER CABINS AND DROP ONE PRIVATE IN JIM'S
COFFEE POT IN THE MORNING
JIM SAID HE WOULD JIS' 'S SOON HAVE
TOBACKER IN HIS COFFEE AND FOUND SO MUCH FAULT WITH IT AND WITH THE
WORK AND BOTHER OF RAISING THE MULLEN AND JEWS HARPING THE RATS AND
PETTING AND FLATTERING UP THE SNAKES AND SPIDERS AND THINGS ON TOP OF
ALL THE OTHER WORK HE HAD TO DO ON PENS AND INSCRIPTIONS AND JOURNALS
AND THINGS WHICH MADE IT MORE TROUBLE AND WORRY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO
BE A PRISONER THAN ANYTHING HE EVER UNDERTOOK THAT TOM MOST LOST ALL
PATIENCE WITH HIM AND SAID HE WAS JUST LOADENED DOWN WITH MORE GAUDIER
CHANCES THAN A PRISONER EVER HAD IN THE WORLD TO MAKE A NAME FOR
HIMSELF AND YET HE DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THEM AND THEY WAS
JUST ABOUT WASTED ON HIM
SO JIM HE WAS SORRY AND SAID HE WOULDN'T
BEHAVE SO NO MORE AND THEN ME AND TOM SHOVED FOR BED
CHAPTER XXXIX
IN THE MORNING WE WENT UP TO THE VILLAGE AND BOUGHT A WIRE RAT TRAP AND
FETCHED IT DOWN AND UNSTOPPED THE BEST RAT HOLE AND IN ABOUT AN HOUR
WE HAD FIFTEEN OF THE BULLIEST KIND OF ONES AND THEN WE TOOK IT AND PUT
IT IN A SAFE PLACE UNDER AUNT SALLY'S BED
BUT WHILE WE WAS GONE FOR
SPIDERS LITTLE THOMAS FRANKLIN BENJAMIN JEFFERSON ELEXANDER PHELPS FOUND
IT THERE AND OPENED THE DOOR OF IT TO SEE IF THE RATS WOULD COME OUT
AND THEY DID AND AUNT SALLY SHE COME IN AND WHEN WE GOT BACK SHE WAS
A STANDING ON TOP OF THE BED RAISING CAIN AND THE RATS WAS DOING WHAT
THEY COULD TO KEEP OFF THE DULL TIMES FOR HER
SO SHE TOOK AND DUSTED
US BOTH WITH THE HICKRY AND WE WAS AS MUCH AS TWO HOURS CATCHING
ANOTHER FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN DRAT THAT MEDDLESOME CUB AND THEY WARN'T
THE LIKELIEST NUTHER BECAUSE THE FIRST HAUL WAS THE PICK OF THE FLOCK
I NEVER SEE A LIKELIER LOT OF RATS THAN WHAT THAT FIRST HAUL WAS
WE GOT A SPLENDID STOCK OF SORTED SPIDERS AND BUGS AND FROGS AND
CATERPILLARS AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND WE LIKE TO GOT A HORNET'S
NEST BUT WE DIDN'T
THE FAMILY WAS AT HOME
WE DIDN'T GIVE IT RIGHT
UP BUT STAYED WITH THEM AS LONG AS WE COULD BECAUSE WE ALLOWED WE'D
TIRE THEM OUT OR THEY'D GOT TO TIRE US OUT AND THEY DONE IT
THEN WE
GOT ALLYCUMPAIN AND RUBBED ON THE PLACES AND WAS PRETTY NEAR ALL RIGHT
AGAIN BUT COULDN'T SET DOWN CONVENIENT
AND SO WE WENT FOR THE SNAKES
AND GRABBED A COUPLE OF DOZEN GARTERS AND HOUSE SNAKES AND PUT THEM IN
A BAG AND PUT IT IN OUR ROOM AND BY THAT TIME IT WAS SUPPER TIME AND
A RATTLING GOOD HONEST DAY'S WORK AND HUNGRY OH NO I RECKON NOT
AND THERE WARN'T A BLESSED SNAKE UP THERE WHEN WE WENT BACK WE DIDN'T
HALF TIE THE SACK AND THEY WORKED OUT SOMEHOW AND LEFT
BUT IT DIDN'T
MATTER MUCH BECAUSE THEY WAS STILL ON THE PREMISES SOMEWHERES
SO
WE JUDGED WE COULD GET SOME OF THEM AGAIN
NO THERE WARN'T NO REAL
SCARCITY OF SNAKES ABOUT THE HOUSE FOR A CONSIDERABLE SPELL
YOU'D SEE
THEM DRIPPING FROM THE RAFTERS AND PLACES EVERY NOW AND THEN AND THEY
GENERLY LANDED IN YOUR PLATE OR DOWN THE BACK OF YOUR NECK AND MOST
OF THE TIME WHERE YOU DIDN'T WANT THEM
WELL THEY WAS HANDSOME AND
STRIPED AND THERE WARN'T NO HARM IN A MILLION OF THEM BUT THAT NEVER
MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO AUNT SALLY SHE DESPISED SNAKES BE THE BREED WHAT
THEY MIGHT AND SHE COULDN'T STAND THEM NO WAY YOU COULD FIX IT AND
EVERY TIME ONE OF THEM FLOPPED DOWN ON HER IT DIDN'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
WHAT SHE WAS DOING SHE WOULD JUST LAY THAT WORK DOWN AND LIGHT OUT
I
NEVER SEE SUCH A WOMAN
AND YOU COULD HEAR HER WHOOP TO JERICHO
YOU
COULDN'T GET HER TO TAKE A HOLT OF ONE OF THEM WITH THE TONGS
AND IF
SHE TURNED OVER AND FOUND ONE IN BED SHE WOULD SCRAMBLE OUT AND LIFT A
HOWL THAT YOU WOULD THINK THE HOUSE WAS AFIRE
SHE DISTURBED THE OLD
MAN SO THAT HE SAID HE COULD MOST WISH THERE HADN'T EVER BEEN NO SNAKES
CREATED
WHY AFTER EVERY LAST SNAKE HAD BEEN GONE CLEAR OUT OF THE
HOUSE FOR AS MUCH AS A WEEK AUNT SALLY WARN'T OVER IT YET SHE WARN'T
NEAR OVER IT WHEN SHE WAS SETTING THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING YOU COULD
TOUCH HER ON THE BACK OF HER NECK WITH A FEATHER AND SHE WOULD JUMP
RIGHT OUT OF HER STOCKINGS
IT WAS VERY CURIOUS
BUT TOM SAID ALL
WOMEN WAS JUST SO
HE SAID THEY WAS MADE THAT WAY FOR SOME REASON OR
OTHER
WE GOT A LICKING EVERY TIME ONE OF OUR SNAKES COME IN HER WAY AND SHE
ALLOWED THESE LICKINGS WARN'T NOTHING TO WHAT SHE WOULD DO IF WE EVER
LOADED UP THE PLACE AGAIN WITH THEM
I DIDN'T MIND THE LICKINGS
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T AMOUNT TO NOTHING BUT I MINDED THE TROUBLE WE
HAD TO LAY IN ANOTHER LOT
BUT WE GOT THEM LAID IN AND ALL THE OTHER
THINGS AND YOU NEVER SEE A CABIN AS BLITHESOME AS JIM'S WAS WHEN THEY'D
ALL SWARM OUT FOR MUSIC AND GO FOR HIM
JIM DIDN'T LIKE THE SPIDERS
AND THE SPIDERS DIDN'T LIKE JIM AND SO THEY'D LAY FOR HIM AND MAKE IT
MIGHTY WARM FOR HIM
AND HE SAID THAT BETWEEN THE RATS AND THE SNAKES
AND THE GRINDSTONE THERE WARN'T NO ROOM IN BED FOR HIM SKASELY AND
WHEN THERE WAS A BODY COULDN'T SLEEP IT WAS SO LIVELY AND IT WAS
ALWAYS LIVELY HE SAID BECAUSE THEY NEVER ALL SLEPT AT ONE TIME BUT
TOOK TURN ABOUT SO WHEN THE SNAKES WAS ASLEEP THE RATS WAS ON DECK AND
WHEN THE RATS TURNED IN THE SNAKES COME ON WATCH SO HE ALWAYS HAD ONE
GANG UNDER HIM IN HIS WAY AND T'OTHER GANG HAVING A CIRCUS OVER HIM
AND IF HE GOT UP TO HUNT A NEW PLACE THE SPIDERS WOULD TAKE A CHANCE AT
HIM AS HE CROSSED OVER
HE SAID IF HE EVER GOT OUT THIS TIME HE WOULDN'T
EVER BE A PRISONER AGAIN NOT FOR A SALARY
WELL BY THE END OF THREE WEEKS EVERYTHING WAS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE
THE SHIRT WAS SENT IN EARLY IN A PIE AND EVERY TIME A RAT BIT JIM HE
WOULD GET UP AND WRITE A LITTLE IN HIS JOURNAL WHILST THE INK WAS FRESH
THE PENS WAS MADE THE INSCRIPTIONS AND SO ON WAS ALL CARVED ON THE
GRINDSTONE THE BED LEG WAS SAWED IN TWO AND WE HAD ET UP THE SAWDUST
AND IT GIVE US A MOST AMAZING STOMACH ACHE
WE RECKONED WE WAS ALL
GOING TO DIE BUT DIDN'T
IT WAS THE MOST UNDIGESTIBLE SAWDUST I EVER
SEE AND TOM SAID THE SAME
BUT AS I WAS SAYING WE'D GOT ALL THE WORK DONE NOW AT LAST AND WE WAS
ALL PRETTY MUCH FAGGED OUT TOO BUT MAINLY JIM
THE OLD MAN HAD WROTE
A COUPLE OF TIMES TO THE PLANTATION BELOW ORLEANS TO COME AND GET THEIR
RUNAWAY NIGGER BUT HADN'T GOT NO ANSWER BECAUSE THERE WARN'T NO SUCH
PLANTATION SO HE ALLOWED HE WOULD ADVERTISE JIM IN THE ST
LOUIS AND
NEW ORLEANS PAPERS AND WHEN HE MENTIONED THE ST
LOUIS ONES IT GIVE ME
THE COLD SHIVERS AND I SEE WE HADN'T NO TIME TO LOSE
SO TOM SAID NOW
FOR THE NONNAMOUS LETTERS
WHAT'S THEM I SAYS
WARNINGS TO THE PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING IS UP
SOMETIMES IT'S DONE ONE
WAY SOMETIMES ANOTHER
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY SPYING AROUND THAT
GIVES NOTICE TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE CASTLE
WHEN LOUIS XVI
WAS GOING
TO LIGHT OUT OF THE TOOLERIES A SERVANT GIRL DONE IT
IT'S A VERY GOOD
WAY AND SO IS THE NONNAMOUS LETTERS
WE'LL USE THEM BOTH
AND IT'S
USUAL FOR THE PRISONER'S MOTHER TO CHANGE CLOTHES WITH HIM AND SHE
STAYS IN AND HE SLIDES OUT IN HER CLOTHES
WE'LL DO THAT TOO
BUT LOOKY HERE TOM WHAT DO WE WANT TO WARN ANYBODY FOR THAT
SOMETHING'S UP LET THEM FIND IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES IT'S THEIR
LOOKOUT
YES I KNOW BUT YOU CAN'T DEPEND ON THEM
IT'S THE WAY THEY'VE ACTED
FROM THE VERY START LEFT US TO DO EVERYTHING
THEY'RE SO CONFIDING
AND MULLET HEADED THEY DON'T TAKE NOTICE OF NOTHING AT ALL
SO IF WE
DON'T GIVE THEM NOTICE THERE WON'T BE NOBODY NOR NOTHING TO INTERFERE
WITH US AND SO AFTER ALL OUR HARD WORK AND TROUBLE THIS ESCAPE 'LL GO
OFF PERFECTLY FLAT WON'T AMOUNT TO NOTHING WON'T BE NOTHING TO IT
WELL AS FOR ME TOM THAT'S THE WAY I'D LIKE
SHUCKS HE SAYS AND LOOKED DISGUSTED
SO I SAYS
BUT I AIN'T GOING TO MAKE NO COMPLAINT
ANY WAY THAT SUITS YOU SUITS
ME
WHAT YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE SERVANT GIRL
YOU'LL BE HER
YOU SLIDE IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND HOOK THAT
YALLER GIRL'S FROCK
WHY TOM THAT 'LL MAKE TROUBLE NEXT MORNING BECAUSE OF COURSE SHE
PROB'BLY HAIN'T GOT ANY BUT THAT ONE
I KNOW BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT BUT FIFTEEN MINUTES TO CARRY THE
NONNAMOUS LETTER AND SHOVE IT UNDER THE FRONT DOOR
ALL RIGHT THEN I'LL DO IT BUT I COULD CARRY IT JUST AS HANDY IN MY
OWN TOGS
YOU WOULDN'T LOOK LIKE A SERVANT GIRL THEN WOULD YOU
NO BUT THERE WON'T BE NOBODY TO SEE WHAT I LOOK LIKE ANYWAY
THAT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
THE THING FOR US TO DO IS JUST
TO DO OUR DUTY AND NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER ANYBODY SEES US DO IT OR
NOT
HAIN'T YOU GOT NO PRINCIPLE AT ALL
ALL RIGHT I AIN'T SAYING NOTHING I'M THE SERVANT GIRL
WHO'S JIM'S
MOTHER
I'M HIS MOTHER
I'LL HOOK A GOWN FROM AUNT SALLY
WELL THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO STAY IN THE CABIN WHEN ME AND JIM LEAVES
NOT MUCH
I'LL STUFF JIM'S CLOTHES FULL OF STRAW AND LAY IT ON HIS BED
TO REPRESENT HIS MOTHER IN DISGUISE AND JIM 'LL TAKE THE NIGGER WOMAN'S
GOWN OFF OF ME AND WEAR IT AND WE'LL ALL EVADE TOGETHER
WHEN A
PRISONER OF STYLE ESCAPES IT'S CALLED AN EVASION
IT'S ALWAYS CALLED
SO WHEN A KING ESCAPES F'RINSTANCE
AND THE SAME WITH A KING'S SON
IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER HE'S A NATURAL ONE OR AN UNNATURAL
ONE
SO TOM HE WROTE THE NONNAMOUS LETTER AND I SMOUCHED THE YALLER WENCH'S
FROCK THAT NIGHT AND PUT IT ON AND SHOVED IT UNDER THE FRONT DOOR THE
WAY TOM TOLD ME TO
IT SAID
BEWARE
TROUBLE IS BREWING
KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT
UNKNOWN FRIEND
NEXT NIGHT WE STUCK A PICTURE WHICH TOM DRAWED IN BLOOD OF A SKULL AND
CROSSBONES ON THE FRONT DOOR AND NEXT NIGHT ANOTHER ONE OF A COFFIN ON
THE BACK DOOR
I NEVER SEE A FAMILY IN SUCH A SWEAT
THEY COULDN'T A
BEEN WORSE SCARED IF THE PLACE HAD A BEEN FULL OF GHOSTS LAYING FOR THEM
BEHIND EVERYTHING AND UNDER THE BEDS AND SHIVERING THROUGH THE AIR
IF
A DOOR BANGED AUNT SALLY SHE JUMPED AND SAID OUCH IF ANYTHING FELL
SHE JUMPED AND SAID OUCH IF YOU HAPPENED TO TOUCH HER WHEN SHE
WARN'T NOTICING SHE DONE THE SAME SHE COULDN'T FACE NOWAY AND BE
SATISFIED BECAUSE SHE ALLOWED THERE WAS SOMETHING BEHIND HER EVERY
TIME SO SHE WAS ALWAYS A WHIRLING AROUND SUDDEN AND SAYING OUCH AND
BEFORE SHE'D GOT TWO THIRDS AROUND SHE'D WHIRL BACK AGAIN AND SAY IT
AGAIN AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO TO BED BUT SHE DASN'T SET UP
SO THE
THING WAS WORKING VERY WELL TOM SAID HE SAID HE NEVER SEE A THING WORK
MORE SATISFACTORY
HE SAID IT SHOWED IT WAS DONE RIGHT
SO HE SAID NOW FOR THE GRAND BULGE SO THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE
STREAK OF DAWN WE GOT ANOTHER LETTER READY AND WAS WONDERING WHAT WE
BETTER DO WITH IT BECAUSE WE HEARD THEM SAY AT SUPPER THEY WAS GOING
TO HAVE A NIGGER ON WATCH AT BOTH DOORS ALL NIGHT
TOM HE WENT DOWN THE
LIGHTNING ROD TO SPY AROUND AND THE NIGGER AT THE BACK DOOR WAS ASLEEP
AND HE STUCK IT IN THE BACK OF HIS NECK AND COME BACK
THIS LETTER
SAID
DON'T BETRAY ME I WISH TO BE YOUR FRIEND
THERE IS A DESPRATE GANG OF
CUTTHROATS FROM OVER IN THE INDIAN TERRITORY GOING TO STEAL YOUR RUNAWAY
NIGGER TO NIGHT AND THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SCARE YOU SO AS YOU WILL
STAY IN THE HOUSE AND NOT BOTHER THEM
I AM ONE OF THE GANG BUT HAVE
GOT RELIGGION AND WISH TO QUIT IT AND LEAD AN HONEST LIFE AGAIN AND
WILL BETRAY THE HELISH DESIGN
THEY WILL SNEAK DOWN FROM NORTHARDS
ALONG THE FENCE AT MIDNIGHT EXACT WITH A FALSE KEY AND GO IN THE
NIGGER'S CABIN TO GET HIM
I AM TO BE OFF A PIECE AND BLOW A TIN HORN
IF I SEE ANY DANGER BUT STEAD OF THAT I WILL BAA LIKE A SHEEP SOON AS
THEY GET IN AND NOT BLOW AT ALL THEN WHILST THEY ARE GETTING HIS
CHAINS LOOSE YOU SLIP THERE AND LOCK THEM IN AND CAN KILL THEM AT YOUR
LEASURE
DON'T DO ANYTHING BUT JUST THE WAY I AM TELLING YOU IF YOU DO
THEY WILL SUSPICION SOMETHING AND RAISE WHOOP JAMBOREEHOO
I DO NOT WISH
ANY REWARD BUT TO KNOW I HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING
UNKNOWN FRIEND
CHAPTER XL
WE WAS FEELING PRETTY GOOD AFTER BREAKFAST AND TOOK MY CANOE AND WENT
OVER THE RIVER A FISHING WITH A LUNCH AND HAD A GOOD TIME AND TOOK A
LOOK AT THE RAFT AND FOUND HER ALL RIGHT AND GOT HOME LATE TO SUPPER
AND FOUND THEM IN SUCH A SWEAT AND WORRY THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHICH END THEY
WAS STANDING ON AND MADE US GO RIGHT OFF TO BED THE MINUTE WE WAS DONE
SUPPER AND WOULDN'T TELL US WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS AND NEVER LET ON A
WORD ABOUT THE NEW LETTER BUT DIDN'T NEED TO BECAUSE WE KNOWED AS MUCH
ABOUT IT AS ANYBODY DID AND AS SOON AS WE WAS HALF UP STAIRS AND HER
BACK WAS TURNED WE SLID FOR THE CELLAR CUPBOARD AND LOADED UP A GOOD
LUNCH AND TOOK IT UP TO OUR ROOM AND WENT TO BED AND GOT UP ABOUT
HALF PAST ELEVEN AND TOM PUT ON AUNT SALLY'S DRESS THAT HE STOLE AND
WAS GOING TO START WITH THE LUNCH BUT SAYS
WHERE'S THE BUTTER
I LAID OUT A HUNK OF IT I SAYS ON A PIECE OF A CORN PONE
WELL YOU LEFT IT LAID OUT THEN IT AIN'T HERE
WE CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT IT I SAYS
WE CAN GET ALONG WITH IT TOO HE SAYS JUST YOU SLIDE DOWN CELLAR
AND FETCH IT
AND THEN MOSEY RIGHT DOWN THE LIGHTNING ROD AND COME
ALONG
I'LL GO AND STUFF THE STRAW INTO JIM'S CLOTHES TO REPRESENT HIS
MOTHER IN DISGUISE AND BE READY TO BAA LIKE A SHEEP AND SHOVE SOON AS
YOU GET THERE
SO OUT HE WENT AND DOWN CELLAR WENT I
THE HUNK OF BUTTER BIG AS
A PERSON'S FIST WAS WHERE I HAD LEFT IT SO I TOOK UP THE SLAB OF
CORN PONE WITH IT ON AND BLOWED OUT MY LIGHT AND STARTED UP STAIRS
VERY STEALTHY AND GOT UP TO THE MAIN FLOOR ALL RIGHT BUT HERE COMES
AUNT SALLY WITH A CANDLE AND I CLAPPED THE TRUCK IN MY HAT AND CLAPPED
MY HAT ON MY HEAD AND THE NEXT SECOND SHE SEE ME AND SHE SAYS
YOU BEEN DOWN CELLAR
YES'M
WHAT YOU BEEN DOING DOWN THERE
NOTH'N
NOTH'N
NO'M
WELL THEN WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO GO DOWN THERE THIS TIME OF NIGHT
I DON'T KNOW 'M
YOU DON'T KNOW DON'T ANSWER ME THAT WAY
TOM I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOU BEEN DOING DOWN THERE
I HAIN'T BEEN DOING A SINGLE THING AUNT SALLY I HOPE TO GRACIOUS IF I
HAVE
I RECKONED SHE'D LET ME GO NOW AND AS A GENERL THING SHE WOULD BUT I
S'POSE THERE WAS SO MANY STRANGE THINGS GOING ON SHE WAS JUST IN A SWEAT
ABOUT EVERY LITTLE THING THAT WARN'T YARD STICK STRAIGHT SO SHE SAYS
VERY DECIDED
YOU JUST MARCH INTO THAT SETTING ROOM AND STAY THERE TILL I COME
YOU
BEEN UP TO SOMETHING YOU NO BUSINESS TO AND I LAY I'LL FIND OUT WHAT IT
IS BEFORE I'M DONE WITH YOU
SO SHE WENT AWAY AS I OPENED THE DOOR AND WALKED INTO THE SETTING ROOM
MY BUT THERE WAS A CROWD THERE FIFTEEN FARMERS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM
HAD A GUN
I WAS MOST POWERFUL SICK AND SLUNK TO A CHAIR AND SET DOWN
THEY WAS SETTING AROUND SOME OF THEM TALKING A LITTLE IN A LOW VOICE
AND ALL OF THEM FIDGETY AND UNEASY BUT TRYING TO LOOK LIKE THEY WARN'T
BUT I KNOWED THEY WAS BECAUSE THEY WAS ALWAYS TAKING OFF THEIR HATS
AND PUTTING THEM ON AND SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS AND CHANGING THEIR
SEATS AND FUMBLING WITH THEIR BUTTONS
I WARN'T EASY MYSELF BUT I
DIDN'T TAKE MY HAT OFF ALL THE SAME
I DID WISH AUNT SALLY WOULD COME AND GET DONE WITH ME AND LICK ME IF
SHE WANTED TO AND LET ME GET AWAY AND TELL TOM HOW WE'D OVERDONE THIS
THING AND WHAT A THUNDERING HORNET'S NEST WE'D GOT OURSELVES INTO SO
WE COULD STOP FOOLING AROUND STRAIGHT OFF AND CLEAR OUT WITH JIM BEFORE
THESE RIPS GOT OUT OF PATIENCE AND COME FOR US
AT LAST SHE COME AND BEGUN TO ASK ME QUESTIONS BUT I COULDN'T ANSWER
THEM STRAIGHT I DIDN'T KNOW WHICH END OF ME WAS UP BECAUSE THESE MEN
WAS IN SUCH A FIDGET NOW THAT SOME WAS WANTING TO START RIGHT NOW AND
LAY FOR THEM DESPERADOES AND SAYING IT WARN'T BUT A FEW MINUTES TO
MIDNIGHT AND OTHERS WAS TRYING TO GET THEM TO HOLD ON AND WAIT FOR THE
SHEEP SIGNAL AND HERE WAS AUNTY PEGGING AWAY AT THE QUESTIONS AND
ME A SHAKING ALL OVER AND READY TO SINK DOWN IN MY TRACKS I WAS
THAT SCARED AND THE PLACE GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER AND THE BUTTER
BEGINNING TO MELT AND RUN DOWN MY NECK AND BEHIND MY EARS AND PRETTY
SOON WHEN ONE OF THEM SAYS I'M FOR GOING AND GETTING IN THE CABIN
FIRST AND RIGHT NOW AND CATCHING THEM WHEN THEY COME I MOST
DROPPED AND A STREAK OF BUTTER COME A TRICKLING DOWN MY FOREHEAD AND
AUNT SALLY SHE SEE IT AND TURNS WHITE AS A SHEET AND SAYS
FOR THE LAND'S SAKE WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE CHILD HE'S GOT THE

DODGED INTO THE BUSH AND LET THEM GO BY AND THEN DROPPED IN BEHIND
THEM
THEY'D HAD ALL THE DOGS SHUT UP SO THEY WOULDN'T SCARE OFF THE
ROBBERS BUT BY THIS TIME SOMEBODY HAD LET THEM LOOSE AND HERE THEY

HOWDY AND TORE RIGHT AHEAD TOWARDS THE SHOUTING AND CLATTERING AND
THEN WE UP STEAM AGAIN AND WHIZZED ALONG AFTER THEM TILL WE WAS NEARLY

CHAPTER XLI
THE DOCTOR WAS AN OLD MAN A VERY NICE KIND LOOKING OLD MAN WHEN I GOT
HIM UP
I TOLD HIM ME AND MY BROTHER WAS OVER ON SPANISH ISLAND HUNTING
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND CAMPED ON A PIECE OF A RAFT WE FOUND AND ABOUT
MIDNIGHT HE MUST A KICKED HIS GUN IN HIS DREAMS FOR IT WENT OFF AND
SHOT HIM IN THE LEG AND WE WANTED HIM TO GO OVER THERE AND FIX IT AND
NOT SAY NOTHING ABOUT IT NOR LET ANYBODY KNOW BECAUSE WE WANTED TO
COME HOME THIS EVENING AND SURPRISE THE FOLKS
WHO IS YOUR FOLKS HE SAYS
THE PHELPSES DOWN YONDER
OH HE SAYS
AND AFTER A MINUTE HE SAYS
HOW'D YOU SAY HE GOT SHOT
HE HAD A DREAM I SAYS AND IT SHOT HIM
SINGULAR DREAM HE SAYS
SO HE LIT UP HIS LANTERN AND GOT HIS SADDLE BAGS AND WE STARTED
BUT
WHEN HE SEES THE CANOE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOK OF HER SAID SHE WAS BIG
ENOUGH FOR ONE BUT DIDN'T LOOK PRETTY SAFE FOR TWO
I SAYS
OH YOU NEEDN'T BE AFEARD SIR SHE CARRIED THE THREE OF US EASY
ENOUGH
WHAT THREE
WHY ME AND SID AND AND AND THE GUNS THAT'S WHAT I MEAN
OH HE SAYS
BUT HE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GUNNEL AND ROCKED HER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
AND SAID HE RECKONED HE'D LOOK AROUND FOR A BIGGER ONE
BUT THEY WAS
ALL LOCKED AND CHAINED SO HE TOOK MY CANOE AND SAID FOR ME TO WAIT
TILL HE COME BACK OR I COULD HUNT AROUND FURTHER OR MAYBE I BETTER
GO DOWN HOME AND GET THEM READY FOR THE SURPRISE IF I WANTED TO
BUT
I SAID I DIDN'T SO I TOLD HIM JUST HOW TO FIND THE RAFT AND THEN HE
STARTED
I STRUCK AN IDEA PRETTY SOON
I SAYS TO MYSELF SPOS'N HE CAN'T FIX
THAT LEG JUST IN THREE SHAKES OF A SHEEP'S TAIL AS THE SAYING IS
SPOS'N IT TAKES HIM THREE OR FOUR DAYS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO LAY
AROUND THERE TILL HE LETS THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG NO SIR I KNOW WHAT
I'LL DO
I'LL WAIT AND WHEN HE COMES BACK IF HE SAYS HE'S GOT TO
GO ANY MORE I'LL GET DOWN THERE TOO IF I SWIM AND WE'LL TAKE AND TIE
HIM AND KEEP HIM AND SHOVE OUT DOWN THE RIVER AND WHEN TOM'S DONE
WITH HIM WE'LL GIVE HIM WHAT IT'S WORTH OR ALL WE GOT AND THEN LET HIM
GET ASHORE
SO THEN I CREPT INTO A LUMBER PILE TO GET SOME SLEEP AND NEXT TIME I
WAKED UP THE SUN WAS AWAY UP OVER MY HEAD I SHOT OUT AND WENT FOR THE
DOCTOR'S HOUSE BUT THEY TOLD ME HE'D GONE AWAY IN THE NIGHT SOME TIME
OR OTHER AND WARN'T BACK YET

ROOM THIS MORNING IF I GO OUT TO ONE SIDE AND STUDY OVER IT A LITTLE
SO I DONE IT

AND WHEN
IT WAS LATE IN THE DAY THE PEOPLE ALL WENT AND THEN I COME IN AND
TOLD HER THE NOISE AND SHOOTING WAKED UP ME AND SID AND THE DOOR WAS
LOCKED AND WE WANTED TO SEE THE FUN SO WE WENT DOWN THE LIGHTNING ROD
AND BOTH OF US GOT HURT A LITTLE AND WE DIDN'T NEVER WANT TO TRY THAT
NO MORE
AND THEN I WENT ON AND TOLD HER ALL WHAT I TOLD UNCLE SILAS
BEFORE AND THEN SHE SAID SHE'D FORGIVE US AND MAYBE IT WAS ALL RIGHT
ENOUGH ANYWAY AND ABOUT WHAT A BODY MIGHT EXPECT OF BOYS FOR ALL BOYS
WAS A PRETTY HARUM SCARUM LOT AS FUR AS SHE COULD SEE AND SO AS LONG
AS NO HARM HADN'T COME OF IT SHE JUDGED SHE BETTER PUT IN HER TIME
BEING GRATEFUL WE WAS ALIVE AND WELL AND SHE HAD US STILL STEAD OF
FRETTING OVER WHAT WAS PAST AND DONE

TRACK
AUNT SALLY WAS A GOOD DEAL UNEASY BUT UNCLE SILAS HE SAID
THERE WARN'T NO OCCASION TO BE BOYS WILL BE BOYS HE SAID AND YOU'LL
SEE THIS ONE TURN UP IN THE MORNING ALL SOUND AND RIGHT
SO SHE HAD
TO BE SATISFIED
BUT SHE SAID SHE'D SET UP FOR HIM A WHILE ANYWAY AND
KEEP A LIGHT BURNING SO HE COULD SEE IT
AND THEN WHEN I WENT UP TO BED SHE COME UP WITH ME AND FETCHED HER
CANDLE AND TUCKED ME IN AND MOTHERED ME SO GOOD I FELT MEAN AND LIKE
I COULDN'T LOOK HER IN THE FACE AND SHE SET DOWN ON THE BED AND TALKED
WITH ME A LONG TIME AND SAID WHAT A SPLENDID BOY SID WAS AND DIDN'T
SEEM TO WANT TO EVER STOP TALKING ABOUT HIM AND KEPT ASKING ME EVERY
NOW AND THEN IF I RECKONED HE COULD A GOT LOST OR HURT OR MAYBE
DROWNDED AND MIGHT BE LAYING AT THIS MINUTE SOMEWHERES SUFFERING OR
DEAD AND SHE NOT BY HIM TO HELP HIM AND SO THE TEARS WOULD DRIP DOWN
SILENT AND I WOULD TELL HER THAT SID WAS ALL RIGHT AND WOULD BE HOME
IN THE MORNING SURE AND SHE WOULD SQUEEZE MY HAND OR MAYBE KISS ME
AND TELL ME TO SAY IT AGAIN AND KEEP ON SAYING IT BECAUSE IT DONE HER
GOOD AND SHE WAS IN SO MUCH TROUBLE
AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING AWAY SHE
LOOKED DOWN IN MY EYES SO STEADY AND GENTLE AND SAYS
THE DOOR AIN'T GOING TO BE LOCKED TOM AND THERE'S THE WINDOW AND
THE ROD BUT YOU'LL BE GOOD WON'T YOU AND YOU WON'T GO FOR MY
SAKE
LAWS KNOWS I WANTED TO GO BAD ENOUGH TO SEE ABOUT TOM AND WAS ALL
INTENDING TO GO BUT AFTER THAT I WOULDN'T A WENT NOT FOR KINGDOMS
BUT SHE WAS ON MY MIND AND TOM WAS ON MY MIND SO I SLEPT VERY RESTLESS
AND TWICE I WENT DOWN THE ROD AWAY IN THE NIGHT AND SLIPPED AROUND
FRONT AND SEE HER SETTING THERE BY HER CANDLE IN THE WINDOW WITH HER
EYES TOWARDS THE ROAD AND THE TEARS IN THEM AND I WISHED I COULD DO
SOMETHING FOR HER BUT I COULDN'T ONLY TO SWEAR THAT I WOULDN'T NEVER
DO NOTHING TO GRIEVE HER ANY MORE
AND THE THIRD TIME I WAKED UP AT
DAWN AND SLID DOWN AND SHE WAS THERE YET AND HER CANDLE WAS MOST OUT
AND HER OLD GRAY HEAD WAS RESTING ON HER HAND AND SHE WAS ASLEEP
CHAPTER XLII
THE OLD MAN WAS UPTOWN AGAIN BEFORE BREAKFAST BUT COULDN'T GET NO
TRACK OF TOM AND BOTH OF THEM SET AT THE TABLE THINKING AND NOT SAYING
NOTHING AND LOOKING MOURNFUL AND THEIR COFFEE GETTING COLD AND NOT
EATING ANYTHING
AND BY AND BY THE OLD MAN SAYS
DID I GIVE YOU THE LETTER
WHAT LETTER
THE ONE I GOT YESTERDAY OUT OF THE POST OFFICE
NO YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME NO LETTER
WELL I MUST A FORGOT IT
SO HE RUMMAGED HIS POCKETS AND THEN WENT OFF SOMEWHERES WHERE HE HAD
LAID IT DOWN AND FETCHED IT AND GIVE IT TO HER
SHE SAYS
WHY IT'S FROM ST
PETERSBURG IT'S FROM SIS
I ALLOWED ANOTHER WALK WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT I COULDN'T STIR
BUT
BEFORE SHE COULD BREAK IT OPEN SHE DROPPED IT AND RUN FOR SHE SEE
SOMETHING
AND SO DID I
IT WAS TOM SAWYER ON A MATTRESS AND THAT OLD
DOCTOR AND JIM IN HER CALICO DRESS WITH HIS HANDS TIED BEHIND HIM
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
I HID THE LETTER BEHIND THE FIRST THING THAT COME
HANDY AND RUSHED
SHE FLUNG HERSELF AT TOM CRYING AND SAYS
OH HE'S DEAD HE'S DEAD I KNOW HE'S DEAD
AND TOM HE TURNED HIS HEAD A LITTLE AND MUTTERED SOMETHING OR OTHER
WHICH SHOWED HE WARN'T IN HIS RIGHT MIND THEN SHE FLUNG UP HER HANDS
AND SAYS
HE'S ALIVE THANK GOD AND THAT'S ENOUGH AND SHE SNATCHED A KISS OF
HIM AND FLEW FOR THE HOUSE TO GET THE BED READY AND SCATTERING ORDERS
RIGHT AND LEFT AT THE NIGGERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE AS FAST AS HER TONGUE
COULD GO EVERY JUMP OF THE WAY
I FOLLOWED THE MEN TO SEE WHAT THEY WAS GOING TO DO WITH JIM AND THE
OLD DOCTOR AND UNCLE SILAS FOLLOWED AFTER TOM INTO THE HOUSE
THE MEN
WAS VERY HUFFY AND SOME OF THEM WANTED TO HANG JIM FOR AN EXAMPLE TO
ALL THE OTHER NIGGERS AROUND THERE SO THEY WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO RUN
AWAY LIKE JIM DONE AND MAKING SUCH A RAFT OF TROUBLE AND KEEPING A
WHOLE FAMILY SCARED MOST TO DEATH FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS
BUT THE OTHERS
SAID DON'T DO IT IT WOULDN'T ANSWER AT ALL HE AIN'T OUR NIGGER AND
HIS OWNER WOULD TURN UP AND MAKE US PAY FOR HIM SURE
SO THAT COOLED
THEM DOWN A LITTLE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT'S ALWAYS THE MOST ANXIOUS
FOR TO HANG A NIGGER THAT HAIN'T DONE JUST RIGHT IS ALWAYS THE VERY
ONES THAT AIN'T THE MOST ANXIOUS TO PAY FOR HIM WHEN THEY'VE GOT THEIR
SATISFACTION OUT OF HIM
THEY CUSSED JIM CONSIDERBLE THOUGH AND GIVE HIM A CUFF OR TWO SIDE THE
HEAD ONCE IN A WHILE BUT JIM NEVER SAID NOTHING AND HE NEVER LET ON TO
KNOW ME AND THEY TOOK HIM TO THE SAME CABIN AND PUT HIS OWN CLOTHES
ON HIM AND CHAINED HIM AGAIN AND NOT TO NO BED LEG THIS TIME BUT TO
A BIG STAPLE DROVE INTO THE BOTTOM LOG AND CHAINED HIS HANDS TOO AND
BOTH LEGS AND SAID HE WARN'T TO HAVE NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WATER TO
EAT AFTER THIS TILL HIS OWNER COME OR HE WAS SOLD AT AUCTION BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T COME IN A CERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND FILLED UP OUR HOLE AND
SAID A COUPLE OF FARMERS WITH GUNS MUST STAND WATCH AROUND ABOUT THE
CABIN EVERY NIGHT AND A BULLDOG TIED TO THE DOOR IN THE DAYTIME AND
ABOUT THIS TIME THEY WAS THROUGH WITH THE JOB AND WAS TAPERING OFF WITH
A KIND OF GENERL GOOD BYE CUSSING AND THEN THE OLD DOCTOR COMES AND
TAKES A LOOK AND SAYS
DON'T BE NO ROUGHER ON HIM THAN YOU'RE OBLEEGED TO BECAUSE HE AIN'T
A BAD NIGGER
WHEN I GOT TO WHERE I FOUND THE BOY I SEE I COULDN'T CUT
THE BULLET OUT WITHOUT SOME HELP AND HE WARN'T IN NO CONDITION FOR
ME TO LEAVE TO GO AND GET HELP AND HE GOT A LITTLE WORSE AND A LITTLE
WORSE AND AFTER A LONG TIME HE WENT OUT OF HIS HEAD AND WOULDN'T LET
ME COME A NIGH HIM ANY MORE AND SAID IF I CHALKED HIS RAFT HE'D KILL
ME AND NO END OF WILD FOOLISHNESS LIKE THAT AND I SEE I COULDN'T DO
ANYTHING AT ALL WITH HIM SO I SAYS I GOT TO HAVE HELP SOMEHOW AND
THE MINUTE I SAYS IT OUT CRAWLS THIS NIGGER FROM SOMEWHERES AND SAYS
HE'LL HELP AND HE DONE IT TOO AND DONE IT VERY WELL
OF COURSE I
JUDGED HE MUST BE A RUNAWAY NIGGER AND THERE I WAS AND THERE I HAD
TO STICK RIGHT STRAIGHT ALONG ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND ALL NIGHT
IT
WAS A FIX I TELL YOU I HAD A COUPLE OF PATIENTS WITH THE CHILLS AND
OF COURSE I'D OF LIKED TO RUN UP TO TOWN AND SEE THEM BUT I DASN'T
BECAUSE THE NIGGER MIGHT GET AWAY AND THEN I'D BE TO BLAME AND YET
NEVER A SKIFF COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO HAIL
SO THERE I HAD TO STICK
PLUMB UNTIL DAYLIGHT THIS MORNING AND I NEVER SEE A NIGGER THAT WAS A
BETTER NUSS OR FAITHFULLER AND YET HE WAS RISKING HIS FREEDOM TO DO IT
AND WAS ALL TIRED OUT TOO AND I SEE PLAIN ENOUGH HE'D BEEN WORKED
MAIN HARD LATELY
I LIKED THE NIGGER FOR THAT I TELL YOU GENTLEMEN A
NIGGER LIKE THAT IS WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND KIND TREATMENT TOO
I
HAD EVERYTHING I NEEDED AND THE BOY WAS DOING AS WELL THERE AS HE
WOULD A DONE AT HOME BETTER MAYBE BECAUSE IT WAS SO QUIET BUT THERE I
WAS WITH BOTH OF 'M ON MY HANDS AND THERE I HAD TO STICK TILL ABOUT
DAWN THIS MORNING THEN SOME MEN IN A SKIFF COME BY AND AS GOOD LUCK
WOULD HAVE IT THE NIGGER WAS SETTING BY THE PALLET WITH HIS HEAD PROPPED
ON HIS KNEES SOUND ASLEEP SO I MOTIONED THEM IN QUIET AND THEY SLIPPED
UP ON HIM AND GRABBED HIM AND TIED HIM BEFORE HE KNOWED WHAT HE WAS
ABOUT AND WE NEVER HAD NO TROUBLE
AND THE BOY BEING IN A KIND OF A
FLIGHTY SLEEP TOO WE MUFFLED THE OARS AND HITCHED THE RAFT ON AND
TOWED HER OVER VERY NICE AND QUIET AND THE NIGGER NEVER MADE THE LEAST
ROW NOR SAID A WORD FROM THE START
HE AIN'T NO BAD NIGGER GENTLEMEN
THAT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT HIM
SOMEBODY SAYS
WELL IT SOUNDS VERY GOOD DOCTOR I'M OBLEEGED TO SAY
THEN THE OTHERS SOFTENED UP A LITTLE TOO AND I WAS MIGHTY THANKFUL
TO THAT OLD DOCTOR FOR DOING JIM THAT GOOD TURN AND I WAS GLAD IT WAS
ACCORDING TO MY JUDGMENT OF HIM TOO BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE HAD A GOOD
HEART IN HIM AND WAS A GOOD MAN THE FIRST TIME I SEE HIM
THEN THEY
ALL AGREED THAT JIM HAD ACTED VERY WELL AND WAS DESERVING TO HAVE SOME
NOTICE TOOK OF IT AND REWARD
SO EVERY ONE OF THEM PROMISED RIGHT OUT
AND HEARTY THAT THEY WOULDN'T CUSS HIM NO MORE
THEN THEY COME OUT AND LOCKED HIM UP
I HOPED THEY WAS GOING TO SAY HE
COULD HAVE ONE OR TWO OF THE CHAINS TOOK OFF BECAUSE THEY WAS ROTTEN
HEAVY OR COULD HAVE MEAT AND GREENS WITH HIS BREAD AND WATER BUT THEY
DIDN'T THINK OF IT AND I RECKONED IT WARN'T BEST FOR ME TO MIX IN BUT
I JUDGED I'D GET THE DOCTOR'S YARN TO AUNT SALLY SOMEHOW OR OTHER AS
SOON AS I'D GOT THROUGH THE BREAKERS THAT WAS LAYING JUST AHEAD OF
ME EXPLANATIONS I MEAN OF HOW I FORGOT TO MENTION ABOUT SID BEING SHOT
WHEN I WAS TELLING HOW HIM AND ME PUT IN THAT DRATTED NIGHT PADDLING
AROUND HUNTING THE RUNAWAY NIGGER
BUT I HAD PLENTY TIME
AUNT SALLY SHE STUCK TO THE SICK ROOM ALL DAY
AND ALL NIGHT AND EVERY TIME I SEE UNCLE SILAS MOONING AROUND I DODGED
HIM
NEXT MORNING I HEARD TOM WAS A GOOD DEAL BETTER AND THEY SAID AUNT
SALLY WAS GONE TO GET A NAP
SO I SLIPS TO THE SICK ROOM AND IF I
FOUND HIM AWAKE I RECKONED WE COULD PUT UP A YARN FOR THE FAMILY THAT
WOULD WASH
BUT HE WAS SLEEPING AND SLEEPING VERY PEACEFUL TOO AND
PALE NOT FIRE FACED THE WAY HE WAS WHEN HE COME
SO I SET DOWN AND
LAID FOR HIM TO WAKE
IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AUNT SALLY COMES GLIDING
IN AND THERE I WAS UP A STUMP AGAIN SHE MOTIONED ME TO BE STILL AND
SET DOWN BY ME AND BEGUN TO WHISPER AND SAID WE COULD ALL BE JOYFUL
NOW BECAUSE ALL THE SYMPTOMS WAS FIRST RATE AND HE'D BEEN SLEEPING
LIKE THAT FOR EVER SO LONG AND LOOKING BETTER AND PEACEFULLER ALL THE
TIME AND TEN TO ONE HE'D WAKE UP IN HIS RIGHT MIND
SO WE SET THERE WATCHING AND BY AND BY HE STIRS A BIT AND OPENED HIS
EYES VERY NATURAL AND TAKES A LOOK AND SAYS
HELLO WHY I'M AT HOME HOW'S THAT WHERE'S THE RAFT
IT'S ALL RIGHT I SAYS
AND JIM
THE SAME I SAYS BUT COULDN'T SAY IT PRETTY BRASH
BUT HE NEVER
NOTICED BUT SAYS
GOOD SPLENDID NOW WE'RE ALL RIGHT AND SAFE DID YOU TELL AUNTY
I WAS GOING TO SAY YES BUT SHE CHIPPED IN AND SAYS ABOUT WHAT SID
WHY ABOUT THE WAY THE WHOLE THING WAS DONE
WHAT WHOLE THING
WHY THE WHOLE THING
THERE AIN'T BUT ONE HOW WE SET THE RUNAWAY
NIGGER FREE ME AND TOM
GOOD LAND SET THE RUN WHAT IS THE CHILD TALKING ABOUT DEAR DEAR
OUT OF HIS HEAD AGAIN
NO I AIN'T OUT OF MY HEAD I KNOW ALL WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
WE
DID SET HIM FREE ME AND TOM
WE LAID OUT TO DO IT AND WE DONE IT
AND WE DONE IT ELEGANT TOO HE'D GOT A START AND SHE NEVER CHECKED
HIM UP JUST SET AND STARED AND STARED AND LET HIM CLIP ALONG AND
I SEE IT WARN'T NO USE FOR ME TO PUT IN
WHY AUNTY IT COST US A
POWER OF WORK WEEKS OF IT HOURS AND HOURS EVERY NIGHT WHILST YOU WAS
ALL ASLEEP
AND WE HAD TO STEAL CANDLES AND THE SHEET AND THE SHIRT
AND YOUR DRESS AND SPOONS AND TIN PLATES AND CASE KNIVES AND THE
WARMING PAN AND THE GRINDSTONE AND FLOUR AND JUST NO END OF THINGS
AND YOU CAN'T THINK WHAT WORK IT WAS TO MAKE THE SAWS AND PENS AND
INSCRIPTIONS AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND YOU CAN'T THINK HALF THE
FUN IT WAS
AND WE HAD TO MAKE UP THE PICTURES OF COFFINS AND THINGS
AND NONNAMOUS LETTERS FROM THE ROBBERS AND GET UP AND DOWN THE
LIGHTNING ROD AND DIG THE HOLE INTO THE CABIN AND MADE THE ROPE LADDER
AND SEND IT IN COOKED UP IN A PIE AND SEND IN SPOONS AND THINGS TO WORK
WITH IN YOUR APRON POCKET
MERCY SAKES
AND LOAD UP THE CABIN WITH RATS AND SNAKES AND SO ON FOR COMPANY FOR
JIM AND THEN YOU KEPT TOM HERE SO LONG WITH THE BUTTER IN HIS HAT THAT
YOU COME NEAR SPILING THE WHOLE BUSINESS BECAUSE THE MEN COME BEFORE
WE WAS OUT OF THE CABIN AND WE HAD TO RUSH AND THEY HEARD US AND LET
DRIVE AT US AND I GOT MY SHARE AND WE DODGED OUT OF THE PATH AND LET
THEM GO BY AND WHEN THE DOGS COME THEY WARN'T INTERESTED IN US BUT
WENT FOR THE MOST NOISE AND WE GOT OUR CANOE AND MADE FOR THE
RAFT AND WAS ALL SAFE AND JIM WAS A FREE MAN AND WE DONE IT ALL BY
OURSELVES AND WASN'T IT BULLY AUNTY
WELL I NEVER HEARD THE LIKES OF IT IN ALL MY BORN DAYS SO IT WAS
YOU YOU LITTLE RAPSCALLIONS THAT'S BEEN MAKING ALL THIS TROUBLE
AND TURNED EVERYBODY'S WITS CLEAN INSIDE OUT AND SCARED US ALL MOST TO
DEATH
I'VE AS GOOD A NOTION AS EVER I HAD IN MY LIFE TO TAKE IT OUT
O' YOU THIS VERY MINUTE
TO THINK HERE I'VE BEEN NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
A YOU JUST GET WELL ONCE YOU YOUNG SCAMP AND I LAY I'LL TAN THE OLD
HARRY OUT O' BOTH O' YE
BUT TOM HE WAS SO PROUD AND JOYFUL HE JUST COULDN'T HOLD IN
AND HIS TONGUE JUST WENT IT SHE A CHIPPING IN AND SPITTING FIRE ALL
ALONG AND BOTH OF THEM GOING IT AT ONCE LIKE A CAT CONVENTION AND SHE
SAYS
WELL YOU GET ALL THE ENJOYMENT YOU CAN OUT OF IT NOW FOR MIND I
TELL YOU IF I CATCH YOU MEDDLING WITH HIM AGAIN
MEDDLING WITH WHO TOM SAYS DROPPING HIS SMILE AND LOOKING
SURPRISED
WITH WHO WHY THE RUNAWAY NIGGER OF COURSE
WHO'D YOU RECKON
TOM LOOKS AT ME VERY GRAVE AND SAYS
TOM DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME HE WAS ALL RIGHT HASN'T HE GOT AWAY
HIM SAYS AUNT SALLY THE RUNAWAY NIGGER 'DEED HE HASN'T
THEY'VE GOT HIM BACK SAFE AND SOUND AND HE'S IN THAT CABIN AGAIN
ON BREAD AND WATER AND LOADED DOWN WITH CHAINS TILL HE'S CLAIMED OR
SOLD
TOM ROSE SQUARE UP IN BED WITH HIS EYE HOT AND HIS NOSTRILS OPENING
AND SHUTTING LIKE GILLS AND SINGS OUT TO ME
THEY HAIN'T NO RIGHT TO SHUT HIM UP SHOVE AND DON'T YOU LOSE A
MINUTE
TURN HIM LOOSE HE AIN'T NO SLAVE HE'S AS FREE AS ANY CRETUR
THAT WALKS THIS EARTH
WHAT DOES THE CHILD MEAN
I MEAN EVERY WORD I SAY AUNT SALLY AND IF SOMEBODY DON'T GO I'LL
GO
I'VE KNOWED HIM ALL HIS LIFE AND SO HAS TOM THERE
OLD MISS
WATSON DIED TWO MONTHS AGO AND SHE WAS ASHAMED SHE EVER WAS GOING TO
SELL HIM DOWN THE RIVER AND SAID SO AND SHE SET HIM FREE IN HER
WILL
THEN WHAT ON EARTH DID YOU WANT TO SET HIM FREE FOR SEEING HE WAS
ALREADY FREE
WELL THAT IS A QUESTION I MUST SAY AND JUST LIKE WOMEN WHY
I WANTED THE ADVENTURE OF IT AND I'D A WADED NECK DEEP IN BLOOD
TO GOODNESS ALIVE AUNT POLLY
IF SHE WARN'T STANDING RIGHT THERE JUST INSIDE THE DOOR LOOKING AS
SWEET AND CONTENTED AS AN ANGEL HALF FULL OF PIE I WISH I MAY NEVER
AUNT SALLY JUMPED FOR HER AND MOST HUGGED THE HEAD OFF OF HER AND
CRIED OVER HER AND I FOUND A GOOD ENOUGH PLACE FOR ME UNDER THE BED
FOR IT WAS GETTING PRETTY SULTRY FOR US SEEMED TO ME
AND I PEEPED
OUT AND IN A LITTLE WHILE TOM'S AUNT POLLY SHOOK HERSELF LOOSE AND
STOOD THERE LOOKING ACROSS AT TOM OVER HER SPECTACLES KIND OF GRINDING
HIM INTO THE EARTH YOU KNOW
AND THEN SHE SAYS
YES YOU BETTER TURN Y'R HEAD AWAY I WOULD IF I WAS YOU TOM
OH DEARY ME SAYS AUNT SALLY IS HE CHANGED SO WHY THAT AIN'T
TOM IT'S SID TOM'S TOM'S WHY WHERE IS TOM HE WAS HERE A MINUTE
AGO
YOU MEAN WHERE'S HUCK FINN THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN I RECKON I HAIN'T
RAISED SUCH A SCAMP AS MY TOM ALL THESE YEARS NOT TO KNOW HIM WHEN I
SEE HIM
THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY HOWDY DO
COME OUT FROM UNDER THAT
BED HUCK FINN
SO I DONE IT
BUT NOT FEELING BRASH
AUNT SALLY SHE WAS ONE OF THE MIXED UPEST LOOKING PERSONS I EVER
SEE EXCEPT ONE AND THAT WAS UNCLE SILAS WHEN HE COME IN AND THEY TOLD
IT ALL TO HIM
IT KIND OF MADE HIM DRUNK AS YOU MAY SAY AND HE DIDN'T
KNOW NOTHING AT ALL THE REST OF THE DAY AND PREACHED A PRAYER MEETING
SERMON THAT NIGHT THAT GAVE HIM A RATTLING RUPUTATION BECAUSE THE
OLDEST MAN IN THE WORLD COULDN'T A UNDERSTOOD IT
SO TOM'S AUNT POLLY
SHE TOLD ALL ABOUT WHO I WAS AND WHAT AND I HAD TO UP AND TELL HOW
I WAS IN SUCH A TIGHT PLACE THAT WHEN MRS
PHELPS TOOK ME FOR TOM
SAWYER SHE CHIPPED IN AND SAYS OH GO ON AND CALL ME AUNT SALLY I'M
USED TO IT NOW AND 'TAIN'T NO NEED TO CHANGE THAT WHEN AUNT SALLY TOOK
ME FOR TOM SAWYER I HAD TO STAND IT THERE WARN'T NO OTHER WAY AND
I KNOWED HE WOULDN'T MIND BECAUSE IT WOULD BE NUTS FOR HIM BEING
A MYSTERY AND HE'D MAKE AN ADVENTURE OUT OF IT AND BE PERFECTLY
SATISFIED
AND SO IT TURNED OUT AND HE LET ON TO BE SID AND MADE
THINGS AS SOFT AS HE COULD FOR ME
AND HIS AUNT POLLY SHE SAID TOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT OLD MISS WATSON SETTING
JIM FREE IN HER WILL AND SO SURE ENOUGH TOM SAWYER HAD GONE AND TOOK
ALL THAT TROUBLE AND BOTHER TO SET A FREE NIGGER FREE AND I COULDN'T
EVER UNDERSTAND BEFORE UNTIL THAT MINUTE AND THAT TALK HOW HE COULD
HELP A BODY SET A NIGGER FREE WITH HIS BRINGING UP
WELL AUNT POLLY SHE SAID THAT WHEN AUNT SALLY WROTE TO HER THAT TOM AND
SID HAD COME ALL RIGHT AND SAFE SHE SAYS TO HERSELF
LOOK AT THAT NOW I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED IT LETTING HIM GO OFF THAT
WAY WITHOUT ANYBODY TO WATCH HIM
SO NOW I GOT TO GO AND TRAPSE ALL
THE WAY DOWN THE RIVER ELEVEN HUNDRED MILE AND FIND OUT WHAT THAT
CREETUR'S UP TO THIS TIME AS LONG AS I COULDN'T SEEM TO GET ANY
ANSWER OUT OF YOU ABOUT IT
WHY I NEVER HEARD NOTHING FROM YOU SAYS AUNT SALLY
WELL I WONDER WHY I WROTE YOU TWICE TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU COULD MEAN
BY SID BEING HERE
WELL I NEVER GOT 'EM SIS
AUNT POLLY SHE TURNS AROUND SLOW AND SEVERE AND SAYS
YOU TOM
WELL WHAT HE SAYS KIND OF PETTISH
DON'T YOU WHAT ME YOU IMPUDENT THING HAND OUT THEM LETTERS
WHAT LETTERS
THEM LETTERS
I BE BOUND IF I HAVE TO TAKE A HOLT OF YOU I'LL
THEY'RE IN THE TRUNK
THERE NOW
AND THEY'RE JUST THE SAME AS THEY
WAS WHEN I GOT THEM OUT OF THE OFFICE
I HAIN'T LOOKED INTO THEM I
HAIN'T TOUCHED THEM
BUT I KNOWED THEY'D MAKE TROUBLE AND I THOUGHT IF
YOU WARN'T IN NO HURRY I'D
WELL YOU DO NEED SKINNING THERE AIN'T NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT
AND I
WROTE ANOTHER ONE TO TELL YOU I WAS COMING AND I S'POSE HE
NO IT COME YESTERDAY I HAIN'T READ IT YET BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT I'VE
GOT THAT ONE
I WANTED TO OFFER TO BET TWO DOLLARS SHE HADN'T BUT I RECKONED MAYBE IT
WAS JUST AS SAFE TO NOT TO
SO I NEVER SAID NOTHING
CHAPTER THE LAST
THE FIRST TIME I CATCHED TOM PRIVATE I ASKED HIM WHAT WAS HIS IDEA TIME
OF THE EVASION WHAT IT WAS HE'D PLANNED TO DO IF THE EVASION WORKED ALL
RIGHT AND HE MANAGED TO SET A NIGGER FREE THAT WAS ALREADY FREE BEFORE
AND HE SAID WHAT HE HAD PLANNED IN HIS HEAD FROM THE START IF WE GOT
JIM OUT ALL SAFE WAS FOR US TO RUN HIM DOWN THE RIVER ON THE RAFT AND
HAVE ADVENTURES PLUMB TO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AND THEN TELL HIM ABOUT
HIS BEING FREE AND TAKE HIM BACK UP HOME ON A STEAMBOAT IN STYLE
AND PAY HIM FOR HIS LOST TIME AND WRITE WORD AHEAD AND GET OUT ALL
THE NIGGERS AROUND AND HAVE THEM WALTZ HIM INTO TOWN WITH A TORCHLIGHT
PROCESSION AND A BRASS BAND AND THEN HE WOULD BE A HERO AND SO WOULD
WE
BUT I RECKONED IT WAS ABOUT AS WELL THE WAY IT WAS
WE HAD JIM OUT OF THE CHAINS IN NO TIME AND WHEN AUNT POLLY AND UNCLE
SILAS AND AUNT SALLY FOUND OUT HOW GOOD HE HELPED THE DOCTOR NURSE TOM
THEY MADE A HEAP OF FUSS OVER HIM AND FIXED HIM UP PRIME AND GIVE HIM
ALL HE WANTED TO EAT AND A GOOD TIME AND NOTHING TO DO
AND WE HAD
HIM UP TO THE SICK ROOM AND HAD A HIGH TALK AND TOM GIVE JIM FORTY
DOLLARS FOR BEING PRISONER FOR US SO PATIENT AND DOING IT UP SO GOOD
AND JIM WAS PLEASED MOST TO DEATH AND BUSTED OUT AND SAYS
DAH NOW HUCK WHAT I TELL YOU WHAT I TELL YOU UP DAH ON JACKSON

SLIDE OUT OF HERE ONE OF THESE NIGHTS AND GET AN OUTFIT AND GO FOR
HOWLING ADVENTURES AMONGST THE INJUNS OVER IN THE TERRITORY FOR A
COUPLE OF WEEKS OR TWO AND I SAYS ALL RIGHT THAT SUITS ME BUT I
AIN'T GOT NO MONEY FOR TO BUY THE OUTFIT AND I RECKON I COULDN'T GET
NONE FROM HOME BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY PAP'S BEEN BACK BEFORE NOW AND GOT
