METAMORPHOSIS
FRANZ KAFKA
TRANSLATED BY DAVID WYLLIE
I
ONE MORNING WHEN GREGOR SAMSA WOKE FROM TROUBLED DREAMS HE FOUND
HIMSELF TRANSFORMED IN HIS BED INTO A HORRIBLE VERMIN
HE LAY ON
HIS ARMOUR LIKE BACK AND IF HE LIFTED HIS HEAD A LITTLE HE COULD
SEE HIS BROWN BELLY SLIGHTLY DOMED AND DIVIDED BY ARCHES INTO STIFF
SECTIONS
THE BEDDING WAS HARDLY ABLE TO COVER IT AND SEEMED READY
TO SLIDE OFF ANY MOMENT
HIS MANY LEGS PITIFULLY THIN COMPARED
WITH THE SIZE OF THE REST OF HIM WAVED ABOUT HELPLESSLY AS HE
LOOKED
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME HE THOUGHT
IT WASN'T A DREAM
HIS ROOM
A PROPER HUMAN ROOM ALTHOUGH A LITTLE TOO SMALL LAY PEACEFULLY
BETWEEN ITS FOUR FAMILIAR WALLS
A COLLECTION OF TEXTILE SAMPLES
LAY SPREAD OUT ON THE TABLE SAMSA WAS A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND
ABOVE IT THERE HUNG A PICTURE THAT HE HAD RECENTLY CUT OUT OF AN
ILLUSTRATED MAGAZINE AND HOUSED IN A NICE GILDED FRAME
IT SHOWED
A LADY FITTED OUT WITH A FUR HAT AND FUR BOA WHO SAT UPRIGHT
RAISING A HEAVY FUR MUFF THAT COVERED THE WHOLE OF HER LOWER ARM
TOWARDS THE VIEWER
GREGOR THEN TURNED TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AT THE DULL WEATHER
DROPS OF RAIN COULD BE HEARD HITTING THE PANE WHICH MADE HIM FEEL
QUITE SAD
HOW ABOUT IF I SLEEP A LITTLE BIT LONGER AND FORGET ALL
THIS NONSENSE HE THOUGHT BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING HE WAS UNABLE TO
DO BECAUSE HE WAS USED TO SLEEPING ON HIS RIGHT AND IN HIS PRESENT
STATE COULDN'T GET INTO THAT POSITION
HOWEVER HARD HE THREW
HIMSELF ONTO HIS RIGHT HE ALWAYS ROLLED BACK TO WHERE HE WAS
HE
MUST HAVE TRIED IT A HUNDRED TIMES SHUT HIS EYES SO THAT HE
WOULDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FLOUNDERING LEGS AND ONLY STOPPED WHEN
HE BEGAN TO FEEL A MILD DULL PAIN THERE THAT HE HAD NEVER FELT
BEFORE
OH GOD HE THOUGHT WHAT A STRENUOUS CAREER IT IS THAT I'VE
CHOSEN TRAVELLING DAY IN AND DAY OUT
DOING BUSINESS LIKE THIS
TAKES MUCH MORE EFFORT THAN DOING YOUR OWN BUSINESS AT HOME AND ON
TOP OF THAT THERE'S THE CURSE OF TRAVELLING WORRIES ABOUT MAKING
TRAIN CONNECTIONS BAD AND IRREGULAR FOOD CONTACT WITH DIFFERENT
PEOPLE ALL THE TIME SO THAT YOU CAN NEVER GET TO KNOW ANYONE OR
BECOME FRIENDLY WITH THEM
IT CAN ALL GO TO HELL HE FELT A
SLIGHT ITCH UP ON HIS BELLY PUSHED HIMSELF SLOWLY UP ON HIS BACK
TOWARDS THE HEADBOARD SO THAT HE COULD LIFT HIS HEAD BETTER FOUND
WHERE THE ITCH WAS AND SAW THAT IT WAS COVERED WITH LOTS OF LITTLE
WHITE SPOTS WHICH HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF AND WHEN HE TRIED
TO FEEL THE PLACE WITH ONE OF HIS LEGS HE DREW IT QUICKLY BACK
BECAUSE AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED IT HE WAS OVERCOME BY A COLD SHUDDER
HE SLID BACK INTO HIS FORMER POSITION
GETTING UP EARLY ALL THE
TIME HE THOUGHT IT MAKES YOU STUPID
YOU'VE GOT TO GET ENOUGH
SLEEP
OTHER TRAVELLING SALESMEN LIVE A LIFE OF LUXURY
FOR
INSTANCE WHENEVER I GO BACK TO THE GUEST HOUSE DURING THE MORNING
TO COPY OUT THE CONTRACT THESE GENTLEMEN ARE ALWAYS STILL SITTING
THERE EATING THEIR BREAKFASTS
I OUGHT TO JUST TRY THAT WITH MY
BOSS I'D GET KICKED OUT ON THE SPOT
BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE THAT
WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR ME
IF I DIDN'T HAVE MY PARENTS TO
THINK ABOUT I'D HAVE GIVEN IN MY NOTICE A LONG TIME AGO I'D HAVE
GONE UP TO THE BOSS AND TOLD HIM JUST WHAT I THINK TELL HIM
EVERYTHING I WOULD LET HIM KNOW JUST WHAT I FEEL
HE'D FALL RIGHT
OFF HIS DESK AND IT'S A FUNNY SORT OF BUSINESS TO BE SITTING UP
THERE AT YOUR DESK TALKING DOWN AT YOUR SUBORDINATES FROM UP THERE
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO RIGHT UP CLOSE BECAUSE THE BOSS IS
HARD OF HEARING
WELL THERE'S STILL SOME HOPE ONCE I'VE GOT THE
MONEY TOGETHER TO PAY OFF MY PARENTS' DEBT TO HIM ANOTHER FIVE OR
SIX YEARS I SUPPOSE THAT'S DEFINITELY WHAT I'LL DO
THAT'S WHEN
I'LL MAKE THE BIG CHANGE
FIRST OF ALL THOUGH I'VE GOT TO GET UP
MY TRAIN LEAVES AT FIVE
AND HE LOOKED OVER AT THE ALARM CLOCK TICKING ON THE CHEST OF
DRAWERS
GOD IN HEAVEN HE THOUGHT
IT WAS HALF PAST SIX AND THE
HANDS WERE QUIETLY MOVING FORWARDS IT WAS EVEN LATER THAN HALF
PAST MORE LIKE QUARTER TO SEVEN
HAD THE ALARM CLOCK NOT RUNG HE
COULD SEE FROM THE BED THAT IT HAD BEEN SET FOR FOUR O'CLOCK AS IT
SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT CERTAINLY MUST HAVE RUNG
YES BUT WAS IT
POSSIBLE TO QUIETLY SLEEP THROUGH THAT FURNITURE RATTLING NOISE
TRUE HE HAD NOT SLEPT PEACEFULLY BUT PROBABLY ALL THE MORE DEEPLY
BECAUSE OF THAT
WHAT SHOULD HE DO NOW THE NEXT TRAIN WENT AT
SEVEN IF HE WERE TO CATCH THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO RUSH LIKE MAD AND
THE COLLECTION OF SAMPLES WAS STILL NOT PACKED AND HE DID NOT AT
ALL FEEL PARTICULARLY FRESH AND LIVELY
AND EVEN IF HE DID CATCH
THE TRAIN HE WOULD NOT AVOID HIS BOSS'S ANGER AS THE OFFICE
ASSISTANT WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE TO SEE THE FIVE O'CLOCK TRAIN GO HE
WOULD HAVE PUT IN HIS REPORT ABOUT GREGOR'S NOT BEING THERE A LONG
TIME AGO
THE OFFICE ASSISTANT WAS THE BOSS'S MAN SPINELESS AND
WITH NO UNDERSTANDING
WHAT ABOUT IF HE REPORTED SICK BUT THAT
WOULD BE EXTREMELY STRAINED AND SUSPICIOUS AS IN FIFTEEN YEARS OF
SERVICE GREGOR HAD NEVER ONCE YET BEEN ILL
HIS BOSS WOULD
CERTAINLY COME ROUND WITH THE DOCTOR FROM THE MEDICAL INSURANCE
COMPANY ACCUSE HIS PARENTS OF HAVING A LAZY SON AND ACCEPT THE
DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION NOT TO MAKE ANY CLAIM AS THE DOCTOR BELIEVED
THAT NO ONE WAS EVER ILL BUT THAT MANY WERE WORKSHY
AND WHAT'S
MORE WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY WRONG IN THIS CASE GREGOR DID IN
FACT APART FROM EXCESSIVE SLEEPINESS AFTER SLEEPING FOR SO LONG
FEEL COMPLETELY WELL AND EVEN FELT MUCH HUNGRIER THAN USUAL
HE WAS STILL HURRIEDLY THINKING ALL THIS THROUGH UNABLE TO DECIDE
TO GET OUT OF THE BED WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK QUARTER TO SEVEN
THERE WAS A CAUTIOUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR NEAR HIS HEAD
GREGOR
SOMEBODY CALLED IT WAS HIS MOTHER IT'S QUARTER TO SEVEN
DIDN'T YOU WANT TO GO SOMEWHERE THAT GENTLE VOICE GREGOR WAS
SHOCKED WHEN HE HEARD HIS OWN VOICE ANSWERING IT COULD HARDLY BE
RECOGNISED AS THE VOICE HE HAD HAD BEFORE
AS IF FROM DEEP INSIDE
HIM THERE WAS A PAINFUL AND UNCONTROLLABLE SQUEAKING MIXED IN WITH
IT THE WORDS COULD BE MADE OUT AT FIRST BUT THEN THERE WAS A SORT
OF ECHO WHICH MADE THEM UNCLEAR LEAVING THE HEARER UNSURE WHETHER
HE HAD HEARD PROPERLY OR NOT
GREGOR HAD WANTED TO GIVE A FULL
ANSWER AND EXPLAIN EVERYTHING BUT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONTENTED
HIMSELF WITH SAYING YES MOTHER YES THANK YOU I'M GETTING UP
NOW THE CHANGE IN GREGOR'S VOICE PROBABLY COULD NOT BE NOTICED
OUTSIDE THROUGH THE WOODEN DOOR AS HIS MOTHER WAS SATISFIED WITH
THIS EXPLANATION AND SHUFFLED AWAY
BUT THIS SHORT CONVERSATION
MADE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY AWARE THAT GREGOR AGAINST
THEIR EXPECTATIONS WAS STILL AT HOME AND SOON HIS FATHER CAME
KNOCKING AT ONE OF THE SIDE DOORS GENTLY BUT WITH HIS FIST
GREGOR GREGOR HE CALLED WHAT'S WRONG AND AFTER A SHORT
WHILE HE CALLED AGAIN WITH A WARNING DEEPNESS IN HIS VOICE GREGOR
GREGOR AT THE OTHER SIDE DOOR HIS SISTER CAME PLAINTIVELY
GREGOR AREN'T YOU WELL DO YOU NEED ANYTHING GREGOR ANSWERED TO
BOTH SIDES I'M READY NOW MAKING AN EFFORT TO REMOVE ALL THE
STRANGENESS FROM HIS VOICE BY ENUNCIATING VERY CAREFULLY AND PUTTING
LONG PAUSES BETWEEN EACH INDIVIDUAL WORD
HIS FATHER WENT BACK TO
HIS BREAKFAST BUT HIS SISTER WHISPERED GREGOR OPEN THE DOOR I
BEG OF YOU GREGOR HOWEVER HAD NO THOUGHT OF OPENING THE DOOR
AND INSTEAD CONGRATULATED HIMSELF FOR HIS CAUTIOUS HABIT ACQUIRED
FROM HIS TRAVELLING OF LOCKING ALL DOORS AT NIGHT EVEN WHEN HE WAS
AT HOME
THE FIRST THING HE WANTED TO DO WAS TO GET UP IN PEACE WITHOUT BEING
DISTURBED TO GET DRESSED AND MOST OF ALL TO HAVE HIS BREAKFAST
ONLY THEN WOULD HE CONSIDER WHAT TO DO NEXT AS HE WAS WELL AWARE
THAT HE WOULD NOT BRING HIS THOUGHTS TO ANY SENSIBLE CONCLUSIONS BY
LYING IN BED
HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD OFTEN FELT A SLIGHT PAIN IN
BED PERHAPS CAUSED BY LYING AWKWARDLY BUT THAT HAD ALWAYS TURNED
OUT TO BE PURE IMAGINATION AND HE WONDERED HOW HIS IMAGININGS WOULD
SLOWLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES TODAY
HE DID NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST
DOUBT THAT THE CHANGE IN HIS VOICE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THE FIRST
SIGN OF A SERIOUS COLD WHICH WAS AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD FOR
TRAVELLING SALESMEN
IT WAS A SIMPLE MATTER TO THROW OFF THE COVERS HE ONLY HAD TO BLOW
HIMSELF UP A LITTLE AND THEY FELL OFF BY THEMSELVES
BUT IT BECAME
DIFFICULT AFTER THAT ESPECIALLY AS HE WAS SO EXCEPTIONALLY BROAD
HE WOULD HAVE USED HIS ARMS AND HIS HANDS TO PUSH HIMSELF UP BUT
INSTEAD OF THEM HE ONLY HAD ALL THOSE LITTLE LEGS CONTINUOUSLY
MOVING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND WHICH HE WAS MOREOVER UNABLE TO
CONTROL
IF HE WANTED TO BEND ONE OF THEM THEN THAT WAS THE FIRST
ONE THAT WOULD STRETCH ITSELF OUT AND IF HE FINALLY MANAGED TO DO
WHAT HE WANTED WITH THAT LEG ALL THE OTHERS SEEMED TO BE SET FREE
AND WOULD MOVE ABOUT PAINFULLY
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE
DONE IN BED GREGOR SAID TO HIMSELF SO DON'T KEEP TRYING TO DO
IT
THE FIRST THING HE WANTED TO DO WAS GET THE LOWER PART OF HIS BODY
OUT OF THE BED BUT HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS LOWER PART AND COULD NOT
IMAGINE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE IT TURNED OUT TO BE TOO HARD TO MOVE
IT WENT SO SLOWLY AND FINALLY ALMOST IN A FRENZY WHEN HE
CARELESSLY SHOVED HIMSELF FORWARDS WITH ALL THE FORCE HE COULD
GATHER HE CHOSE THE WRONG DIRECTION HIT HARD AGAINST THE LOWER
BEDPOST AND LEARNED FROM THE BURNING PAIN HE FELT THAT THE LOWER
PART OF HIS BODY MIGHT WELL AT PRESENT BE THE MOST SENSITIVE
SO THEN HE TRIED TO GET THE TOP PART OF HIS BODY OUT OF THE BED
FIRST CAREFULLY TURNING HIS HEAD TO THE SIDE
THIS HE MANAGED
QUITE EASILY AND DESPITE ITS BREADTH AND ITS WEIGHT THE BULK OF
HIS BODY EVENTUALLY FOLLOWED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HEAD
BUT WHEN HE HAD AT LAST GOT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE BED AND INTO THE
FRESH AIR IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IF HE LET HIMSELF FALL IT WOULD BE
A MIRACLE IF HIS HEAD WERE NOT INJURED SO HE BECAME AFRAID TO CARRY
ON PUSHING HIMSELF FORWARD THE SAME WAY
AND HE COULD NOT KNOCK
HIMSELF OUT NOW AT ANY PRICE BETTER TO STAY IN BED THAN LOSE
CONSCIOUSNESS
IT TOOK JUST AS MUCH EFFORT TO GET BACK TO WHERE HE HAD BEEN
EARLIER BUT WHEN HE LAY THERE SIGHING AND WAS ONCE MORE WATCHING
HIS LEGS AS THEY STRUGGLED AGAINST EACH OTHER EVEN HARDER THAN
BEFORE IF THAT WAS POSSIBLE HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF BRINGING
PEACE AND ORDER TO THIS CHAOS
HE TOLD HIMSELF ONCE MORE THAT IT
WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY IN BED AND THAT THE MOST SENSIBLE
THING TO DO WOULD BE TO GET FREE OF IT IN WHATEVER WAY HE COULD AT
WHATEVER SACRIFICE
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH HE DID NOT FORGET TO
REMIND HIMSELF THAT CALM CONSIDERATION WAS MUCH BETTER THAN RUSHING
TO DESPERATE CONCLUSIONS
AT TIMES LIKE THIS HE WOULD DIRECT HIS
EYES TO THE WINDOW AND LOOK OUT AS CLEARLY AS HE COULD BUT
UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NARROW STREET WAS
ENVELOPED IN MORNING FOG AND THE VIEW HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE OR CHEER
TO OFFER HIM
SEVEN O'CLOCK ALREADY HE SAID TO HIMSELF WHEN THE
CLOCK STRUCK AGAIN SEVEN O'CLOCK AND THERE'S STILL A FOG LIKE
THIS AND HE LAY THERE QUIETLY A WHILE LONGER BREATHING LIGHTLY
AS IF HE PERHAPS EXPECTED THE TOTAL STILLNESS TO BRING THINGS BACK
TO THEIR REAL AND NATURAL STATE
BUT THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF BEFORE IT STRIKES QUARTER PAST SEVEN
I'LL DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE GOT PROPERLY OUT OF BED
AND BY THEN
SOMEBODY WILL HAVE COME ROUND FROM WORK TO ASK WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME
AS WELL AS THEY OPEN UP AT WORK BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK AND SO HE
SET HIMSELF TO THE TASK OF SWINGING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF HIS BODY
OUT OF THE BED ALL AT THE SAME TIME
IF HE SUCCEEDED IN FALLING OUT
OF BED IN THIS WAY AND KEPT HIS HEAD RAISED AS HE DID SO HE COULD
PROBABLY AVOID INJURING IT
HIS BACK SEEMED TO BE QUITE HARD AND
PROBABLY NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO IT FALLING ONTO THE CARPET
HIS
MAIN CONCERN WAS FOR THE LOUD NOISE HE WAS BOUND TO MAKE AND WHICH
EVEN THROUGH ALL THE DOORS WOULD PROBABLY RAISE CONCERN IF NOT
ALARM
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO BE RISKED
WHEN GREGOR WAS ALREADY STICKING HALF WAY OUT OF THE BED THE NEW
METHOD WAS MORE OF A GAME THAN AN EFFORT ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS ROCK
BACK AND FORTH IT OCCURRED TO HIM HOW SIMPLE EVERYTHING WOULD BE
IF SOMEBODY CAME TO HELP HIM
TWO STRONG PEOPLE HE HAD HIS FATHER
AND THE MAID IN MIND WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH THEY WOULD
ONLY HAVE TO PUSH THEIR ARMS UNDER THE DOME OF HIS BACK PEEL HIM
AWAY FROM THE BED BEND DOWN WITH THE LOAD AND THEN BE PATIENT AND
CAREFUL AS HE SWANG OVER ONTO THE FLOOR WHERE HOPEFULLY THE
LITTLE LEGS WOULD FIND A USE
SHOULD HE REALLY CALL FOR HELP
THOUGH EVEN APART FROM THE FACT THAT ALL THE DOORS WERE LOCKED
DESPITE ALL THE DIFFICULTY HE WAS IN HE COULD NOT SUPPRESS A SMILE
AT THIS THOUGHT
AFTER A WHILE HE HAD ALREADY MOVED SO FAR ACROSS THAT IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN HARD FOR HIM TO KEEP HIS BALANCE IF HE ROCKED TOO HARD
THE
TIME WAS NOW TEN PAST SEVEN AND HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A FINAL
DECISION VERY SOON
THEN THERE WAS A RING AT THE DOOR OF THE FLAT
THAT'LL BE SOMEONE FROM WORK HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND FROZE VERY
STILL ALTHOUGH HIS LITTLE LEGS ONLY BECAME ALL THE MORE LIVELY AS
THEY DANCED AROUND
FOR A MOMENT EVERYTHING REMAINED QUIET
THEY'RE NOT OPENING THE DOOR GREGOR SAID TO HIMSELF CAUGHT IN
SOME NONSENSICAL HOPE
BUT THEN OF COURSE THE MAID'S FIRM STEPS
WENT TO THE DOOR AS EVER AND OPENED IT
GREGOR ONLY NEEDED TO HEAR
THE VISITOR'S FIRST WORDS OF GREETING AND HE KNEW WHO IT WAS THE
CHIEF CLERK HIMSELF
WHY DID GREGOR HAVE TO BE THE ONLY ONE
CONDEMNED TO WORK FOR A COMPANY WHERE THEY IMMEDIATELY BECAME HIGHLY
SUSPICIOUS AT THE SLIGHTEST SHORTCOMING WERE ALL EMPLOYEES EVERY
ONE OF THEM LOUTS WAS THERE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO WAS FAITHFUL AND
DEVOTED WHO WOULD GO SO MAD WITH PANGS OF CONSCIENCE THAT HE
COULDN'T GET OUT OF BED IF HE DIDN'T SPEND AT LEAST A COUPLE OF
HOURS IN THE MORNING ON COMPANY BUSINESS WAS IT REALLY NOT ENOUGH
TO LET ONE OF THE TRAINEES MAKE ENQUIRIES ASSUMING ENQUIRIES WERE
EVEN NECESSARY DID THE CHIEF CLERK HAVE TO COME HIMSELF AND DID
THEY HAVE TO SHOW THE WHOLE INNOCENT FAMILY THAT THIS WAS SO
SUSPICIOUS THAT ONLY THE CHIEF CLERK COULD BE TRUSTED TO HAVE THE
WISDOM TO INVESTIGATE IT AND MORE BECAUSE THESE THOUGHTS HAD MADE
HIM UPSET THAN THROUGH ANY PROPER DECISION HE SWANG HIMSELF WITH
ALL HIS FORCE OUT OF THE BED
THERE WAS A LOUD THUMP BUT IT WASN'T
REALLY A LOUD NOISE
HIS FALL WAS SOFTENED A LITTLE BY THE CARPET
AND GREGOR'S BACK WAS ALSO MORE ELASTIC THAN HE HAD THOUGHT WHICH
MADE THE SOUND MUFFLED AND NOT TOO NOTICEABLE
HE HAD NOT HELD HIS
HEAD CAREFULLY ENOUGH THOUGH AND HIT IT AS HE FELL ANNOYED AND IN
PAIN HE TURNED IT AND RUBBED IT AGAINST THE CARPET
SOMETHING'S FALLEN DOWN IN THERE SAID THE CHIEF CLERK IN THE ROOM
ON THE LEFT
GREGOR TRIED TO IMAGINE WHETHER SOMETHING OF THE SORT
THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM TODAY COULD EVER HAPPEN TO THE CHIEF CLERK
TOO YOU HAD TO CONCEDE THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE
BUT AS IF IN GRUFF
REPLY TO THIS QUESTION THE CHIEF CLERK'S FIRM FOOTSTEPS IN HIS
HIGHLY POLISHED BOOTS COULD NOW BE HEARD IN THE ADJOINING ROOM
FROM THE ROOM ON HIS RIGHT GREGOR'S SISTER WHISPERED TO HIM TO LET
HIM KNOW GREGOR THE CHIEF CLERK IS HERE YES I KNOW SAID
GREGOR TO HIMSELF BUT WITHOUT DARING TO RAISE HIS VOICE LOUD ENOUGH
FOR HIS SISTER TO HEAR HIM
GREGOR SAID HIS FATHER NOW FROM THE ROOM TO HIS LEFT THE CHIEF
CLERK HAS COME ROUND AND WANTS TO KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T LEAVE ON THE
EARLY TRAIN
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM
AND ANYWAY HE
WANTS TO SPEAK TO YOU PERSONALLY
SO PLEASE OPEN UP THIS DOOR
I'M
SURE HE'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO FORGIVE THE UNTIDINESS OF YOUR ROOM
THEN THE CHIEF CLERK CALLED GOOD MORNING MR
SAMSA
HE ISN'T
WELL SAID HIS MOTHER TO THE CHIEF CLERK WHILE HIS FATHER
CONTINUED TO SPEAK THROUGH THE DOOR
HE ISN'T WELL PLEASE BELIEVE
ME
WHY ELSE WOULD GREGOR HAVE MISSED A TRAIN THE LAD ONLY EVER
THINKS ABOUT THE BUSINESS
IT NEARLY MAKES ME CROSS THE WAY HE
NEVER GOES OUT IN THE EVENINGS HE'S BEEN IN TOWN FOR A WEEK NOW BUT
STAYED HOME EVERY EVENING
HE SITS WITH US IN THE KITCHEN AND JUST
READS THE PAPER OR STUDIES TRAIN TIMETABLES
HIS IDEA OF RELAXATION
IS WORKING WITH HIS FRETSAW
HE'S MADE A LITTLE FRAME FOR
INSTANCE IT ONLY TOOK HIM TWO OR THREE EVENINGS YOU'LL BE AMAZED
HOW NICE IT IS IT'S HANGING UP IN HIS ROOM YOU'LL SEE IT AS SOON
AS GREGOR OPENS THE DOOR
ANYWAY I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE WE WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET GREGOR TO OPEN THE DOOR BY OURSELVES HE'S SO
STUBBORN AND I'M SURE HE ISN'T WELL HE SAID THIS MORNING THAT HE
IS BUT HE ISN'T I'LL BE THERE IN A MOMENT SAID GREGOR SLOWLY
AND THOUGHTFULLY BUT WITHOUT MOVING SO THAT HE WOULD NOT MISS ANY
WORD OF THE CONVERSATION
WELL I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER WAY OF
EXPLAINING IT MRS
SAMSA SAID THE CHIEF CLERK I HOPE IT'S
NOTHING SERIOUS
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I MUST SAY THAT IF WE
PEOPLE IN COMMERCE EVER BECOME SLIGHTLY UNWELL THEN FORTUNATELY OR
UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU LIKE WE SIMPLY HAVE TO OVERCOME IT BECAUSE OF
BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS CAN THE CHIEF CLERK COME IN TO SEE YOU
NOW THEN ASKED HIS FATHER IMPATIENTLY KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
AGAIN
NO SAID GREGOR
IN THE ROOM ON HIS RIGHT THERE FOLLOWED
A PAINFUL SILENCE IN THE ROOM ON HIS LEFT HIS SISTER BEGAN TO CRY
SO WHY DID HIS SISTER NOT GO AND JOIN THE OTHERS SHE HAD PROBABLY
ONLY JUST GOT UP AND HAD NOT EVEN BEGUN TO GET DRESSED
AND WHY WAS
SHE CRYING WAS IT BECAUSE HE HAD NOT GOT UP AND HAD NOT LET THE
CHIEF CLERK IN BECAUSE HE WAS IN DANGER OF LOSING HIS JOB AND IF
THAT HAPPENED HIS BOSS WOULD ONCE MORE PURSUE THEIR PARENTS WITH THE
SAME DEMANDS AS BEFORE THERE WAS NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE
THAT YET
GREGOR WAS STILL THERE AND HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST
INTENTION OF ABANDONING HIS FAMILY
FOR THE TIME BEING HE JUST LAY
THERE ON THE CARPET AND NO ONE WHO KNEW THE CONDITION HE WAS IN
WOULD SERIOUSLY HAVE EXPECTED HIM TO LET THE CHIEF CLERK IN
IT WAS
ONLY A MINOR DISCOURTESY AND A SUITABLE EXCUSE COULD EASILY BE
FOUND FOR IT LATER ON IT WAS NOT SOMETHING FOR WHICH GREGOR COULD
BE SACKED ON THE SPOT
AND IT SEEMED TO GREGOR MUCH MORE SENSIBLE
TO LEAVE HIM NOW IN PEACE INSTEAD OF DISTURBING HIM WITH TALKING AT
HIM AND CRYING
BUT THE OTHERS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY
WERE WORRIED THAT WOULD EXCUSE THEIR BEHAVIOUR
THE CHIEF CLERK NOW RAISED HIS VOICE MR
SAMSA HE CALLED TO HIM
WHAT IS WRONG YOU BARRICADE YOURSELF IN YOUR ROOM GIVE US NO MORE
THAN YES OR NO FOR AN ANSWER YOU ARE CAUSING SERIOUS AND
UNNECESSARY CONCERN TO YOUR PARENTS AND YOU FAIL AND I MENTION
THIS JUST BY THE WAY YOU FAIL TO CARRY OUT YOUR BUSINESS DUTIES IN
A WAY THAT IS QUITE UNHEARD OF
I'M SPEAKING HERE ON BEHALF OF YOUR
PARENTS AND OF YOUR EMPLOYER AND REALLY MUST REQUEST A CLEAR AND
IMMEDIATE EXPLANATION
I AM ASTONISHED QUITE ASTONISHED
I
THOUGHT I KNEW YOU AS A CALM AND SENSIBLE PERSON AND NOW YOU
SUDDENLY SEEM TO BE SHOWING OFF WITH PECULIAR WHIMS
THIS MORNING
YOUR EMPLOYER DID SUGGEST A POSSIBLE REASON FOR YOUR FAILURE TO
APPEAR IT'S TRUE IT HAD TO DO WITH THE MONEY THAT WAS RECENTLY
ENTRUSTED TO YOU BUT I CAME NEAR TO GIVING HIM MY WORD OF HONOUR
THAT THAT COULD NOT BE THE RIGHT EXPLANATION
BUT NOW THAT I SEE
YOUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE STUBBORNNESS I NO LONGER FEEL ANY WISH
WHATSOEVER TO INTERCEDE ON YOUR BEHALF
AND NOR IS YOUR POSITION
ALL THAT SECURE
I HAD ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO SAY ALL THIS TO YOU
IN PRIVATE BUT SINCE YOU CAUSE ME TO WASTE MY TIME HERE FOR NO GOOD
REASON I DON'T SEE WHY YOUR PARENTS SHOULD NOT ALSO LEARN OF IT
YOUR TURNOVER HAS BEEN VERY UNSATISFACTORY OF LATE I GRANT YOU THAT
IT'S NOT THE TIME OF YEAR TO DO ESPECIALLY GOOD BUSINESS WE
RECOGNISE THAT BUT THERE SIMPLY IS NO TIME OF YEAR TO DO NO
BUSINESS AT ALL MR
SAMSA WE CANNOT ALLOW THERE TO BE
BUT SIR CALLED GREGOR BESIDE HIMSELF AND FORGETTING ALL ELSE IN
THE EXCITEMENT I'LL OPEN UP IMMEDIATELY JUST A MOMENT
I'M
SLIGHTLY UNWELL AN ATTACK OF DIZZINESS I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET
UP
I'M STILL IN BED NOW
I'M QUITE FRESH AGAIN NOW THOUGH
I'M
JUST GETTING OUT OF BED
JUST A MOMENT
BE PATIENT IT'S NOT QUITE
AS EASY AS I'D THOUGHT
I'M QUITE ALRIGHT NOW THOUGH
IT'S
SHOCKING WHAT CAN SUDDENLY HAPPEN TO A PERSON I WAS QUITE ALRIGHT
LAST NIGHT MY PARENTS KNOW ABOUT IT PERHAPS BETTER THAN ME I HAD
A SMALL SYMPTOM OF IT LAST NIGHT ALREADY
THEY MUST HAVE NOTICED
IT
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T LET YOU KNOW AT WORK BUT YOU ALWAYS
THINK YOU CAN GET OVER AN ILLNESS WITHOUT STAYING AT HOME
PLEASE
DON'T MAKE MY PARENTS SUFFER THERE'S NO BASIS FOR ANY OF THE
ACCUSATIONS YOU'RE MAKING NOBODY'S EVER SAID A WORD TO ME ABOUT ANY
OF THESE THINGS
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T READ THE LATEST CONTRACTS I SENT
IN
I'LL SET OFF WITH THE EIGHT O'CLOCK TRAIN AS WELL THESE FEW
HOURS OF REST HAVE GIVEN ME STRENGTH
YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT SIR
I'LL BE IN THE OFFICE SOON AFTER YOU AND PLEASE BE SO GOOD AS TO
TELL THAT TO THE BOSS AND RECOMMEND ME TO HIM
AND WHILE GREGOR GUSHED OUT THESE WORDS HARDLY KNOWING WHAT HE WAS
SAYING HE MADE HIS WAY OVER TO THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THIS WAS
EASILY DONE PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE PRACTISE HE HAD ALREADY HAD IN
BED WHERE HE NOW TRIED TO GET HIMSELF UPRIGHT
HE REALLY DID WANT
TO OPEN THE DOOR REALLY DID WANT TO LET THEM SEE HIM AND TO SPEAK
WITH THE CHIEF CLERK THE OTHERS WERE BEING SO INSISTENT AND HE WAS
CURIOUS TO LEARN WHAT THEY WOULD SAY WHEN THEY CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
IF THEY WERE SHOCKED THEN IT WOULD NO LONGER BE GREGOR'S
RESPONSIBILITY AND HE COULD REST
IF HOWEVER THEY TOOK EVERYTHING
CALMLY HE WOULD STILL HAVE NO REASON TO BE UPSET AND IF HE HURRIED
HE REALLY COULD BE AT THE STATION FOR EIGHT O'CLOCK
THE FIRST FEW
TIMES HE TRIED TO CLIMB UP ON THE SMOOTH CHEST OF DRAWERS HE JUST
SLID DOWN AGAIN BUT HE FINALLY GAVE HIMSELF ONE LAST SWING AND
STOOD THERE UPRIGHT THE LOWER PART OF HIS BODY WAS IN SERIOUS PAIN
BUT HE NO LONGER GAVE ANY ATTENTION TO IT
NOW HE LET HIMSELF FALL
AGAINST THE BACK OF A NEARBY CHAIR AND HELD TIGHTLY TO THE EDGES OF
IT WITH HIS LITTLE LEGS
BY NOW HE HAD ALSO CALMED DOWN AND KEPT
QUIET SO THAT HE COULD LISTEN TO WHAT THE CHIEF CLERK WAS SAYING
DID YOU UNDERSTAND A WORD OF ALL THAT THE CHIEF CLERK ASKED HIS
PARENTS SURELY HE'S NOT TRYING TO MAKE FOOLS OF US
OH GOD
CALLED HIS MOTHER WHO WAS ALREADY IN TEARS HE COULD BE SERIOUSLY
ILL AND WE'RE MAKING HIM SUFFER
GRETE GRETE SHE THEN CRIED
MOTHER HIS SISTER CALLED FROM THE OTHER SIDE
THEY COMMUNICATED
ACROSS GREGOR'S ROOM
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FOR THE DOCTOR STRAIGHT
AWAY
GREGOR IS ILL
QUICK GET THE DOCTOR
DID YOU HEAR THE WAY
GREGOR SPOKE JUST NOW THAT WAS THE VOICE OF AN ANIMAL SAID THE
CHIEF CLERK WITH A CALMNESS THAT WAS IN CONTRAST WITH HIS MOTHER'S
SCREAMS
ANNA ANNA HIS FATHER CALLED INTO THE KITCHEN THROUGH
THE ENTRANCE HALL CLAPPING HIS HANDS GET A LOCKSMITH HERE NOW
AND THE TWO GIRLS THEIR SKIRTS SWISHING IMMEDIATELY RAN OUT
THROUGH THE HALL WRENCHING OPEN THE FRONT DOOR OF THE FLAT AS THEY
WENT
HOW HAD HIS SISTER MANAGED TO GET DRESSED SO QUICKLY THERE
WAS NO SOUND OF THE DOOR BANGING SHUT AGAIN THEY MUST HAVE LEFT IT
OPEN PEOPLE OFTEN DO IN HOMES WHERE SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENED
GREGOR IN CONTRAST HAD BECOME MUCH CALMER
SO THEY COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND HIS WORDS ANY MORE ALTHOUGH THEY SEEMED CLEAR ENOUGH TO
HIM CLEARER THAN BEFORE PERHAPS HIS EARS HAD BECOME USED TO THE
SOUND
THEY HAD REALISED THOUGH THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH HIM AND WERE READY TO HELP
THE FIRST RESPONSE TO HIS
SITUATION HAD BEEN CONFIDENT AND WISE AND THAT MADE HIM FEEL
BETTER
HE FELT THAT HE HAD BEEN DRAWN BACK IN AMONG PEOPLE AND
FROM THE DOCTOR AND THE LOCKSMITH HE EXPECTED GREAT AND SURPRISING
ACHIEVEMENTS ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT REALLY DISTINGUISH ONE FROM THE
OTHER
WHATEVER WAS SAID NEXT WOULD BE CRUCIAL SO IN ORDER TO
MAKE HIS VOICE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE HE COUGHED A LITTLE BUT TAKING
CARE TO DO THIS NOT TOO LOUDLY AS EVEN THIS MIGHT WELL SOUND
DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT A HUMAN COUGHS AND HE WAS NO LONGER SURE
HE COULD JUDGE THIS FOR HIMSELF
MEANWHILE IT HAD BECOME VERY
QUIET IN THE NEXT ROOM
PERHAPS HIS PARENTS WERE SAT AT THE TABLE
WHISPERING WITH THE CHIEF CLERK OR PERHAPS THEY WERE ALL PRESSED
AGAINST THE DOOR AND LISTENING
GREGOR SLOWLY PUSHED HIS WAY OVER TO THE DOOR WITH THE CHAIR
ONCE
THERE HE LET GO OF IT AND THREW HIMSELF ONTO THE DOOR HOLDING
HIMSELF UPRIGHT AGAINST IT USING THE ADHESIVE ON THE TIPS OF HIS
LEGS
HE RESTED THERE A LITTLE WHILE TO RECOVER FROM THE EFFORT
INVOLVED AND THEN SET HIMSELF TO THE TASK OF TURNING THE KEY IN THE
LOCK WITH HIS MOUTH
HE SEEMED UNFORTUNATELY TO HAVE NO PROPER
TEETH HOW WAS HE THEN TO GRASP THE KEY BUT THE LACK OF TEETH
WAS OF COURSE MADE UP FOR WITH A VERY STRONG JAW USING THE JAW
HE REALLY WAS ABLE TO START THE KEY TURNING IGNORING THE FACT THAT
HE MUST HAVE BEEN CAUSING SOME KIND OF DAMAGE AS A BROWN FLUID CAME
FROM HIS MOUTH FLOWED OVER THE KEY AND DRIPPED ONTO THE FLOOR
LISTEN SAID THE CHIEF CLERK IN THE NEXT ROOM HE'S TURNING THE
KEY GREGOR WAS GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS BUT THEY ALL SHOULD
HAVE BEEN CALLING TO HIM HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER TOO WELL DONE
GREGOR THEY SHOULD HAVE CRIED KEEP AT IT KEEP HOLD OF THE
LOCK AND WITH THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE ALL EXCITEDLY FOLLOWING HIS
EFFORTS HE BIT ON THE KEY WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH PAYING NO
ATTENTION TO THE PAIN HE WAS CAUSING HIMSELF
AS THE KEY TURNED
ROUND HE TURNED AROUND THE LOCK WITH IT ONLY HOLDING HIMSELF
UPRIGHT WITH HIS MOUTH AND HUNG ONTO THE KEY OR PUSHED IT DOWN
AGAIN WITH THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF HIS BODY AS NEEDED
THE CLEAR SOUND
OF THE LOCK AS IT SNAPPED BACK WAS GREGOR'S SIGN THAT HE COULD BREAK
HIS CONCENTRATION AND AS HE REGAINED HIS BREATH HE SAID TO HIMSELF
SO I DIDN'T NEED THE LOCKSMITH AFTER ALL
THEN HE LAY HIS HEAD ON
THE HANDLE OF THE DOOR TO OPEN IT COMPLETELY
BECAUSE HE HAD TO OPEN THE DOOR IN THIS WAY IT WAS ALREADY WIDE
OPEN BEFORE HE COULD BE SEEN
HE HAD FIRST TO SLOWLY TURN HIMSELF
AROUND ONE OF THE DOUBLE DOORS AND HE HAD TO DO IT VERY CAREFULLY
IF HE DID NOT WANT TO FALL FLAT ON HIS BACK BEFORE ENTERING THE
ROOM
HE WAS STILL OCCUPIED WITH THIS DIFFICULT MOVEMENT UNABLE TO
PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING ELSE WHEN HE HEARD THE CHIEF CLERK
EXCLAIM A LOUD OH WHICH SOUNDED LIKE THE SOUGHING OF THE WIND
NOW HE ALSO SAW HIM HE WAS THE NEAREST TO THE DOOR HIS HAND
PRESSED AGAINST HIS OPEN MOUTH AND SLOWLY RETREATING AS IF DRIVEN BY
A STEADY AND INVISIBLE FORCE
GREGOR'S MOTHER HER HAIR STILL
DISHEVELLED FROM BED DESPITE THE CHIEF CLERK'S BEING THERE LOOKED
AT HIS FATHER
THEN SHE UNFOLDED HER ARMS TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD
TOWARDS GREGOR AND SANK DOWN ONTO THE FLOOR INTO HER SKIRTS THAT
SPREAD THEMSELVES OUT AROUND HER AS HER HEAD DISAPPEARED DOWN ONTO
HER BREAST
HIS FATHER LOOKED HOSTILE AND CLENCHED HIS FISTS AS IF
WANTING TO KNOCK GREGOR BACK INTO HIS ROOM
THEN HE LOOKED
UNCERTAINLY ROUND THE LIVING ROOM COVERED HIS EYES WITH HIS HANDS
AND WEPT SO THAT HIS POWERFUL CHEST SHOOK
SO GREGOR DID NOT GO INTO THE ROOM BUT LEANT AGAINST THE INSIDE OF
THE OTHER DOOR WHICH WAS STILL HELD BOLTED IN PLACE
IN THIS WAY
ONLY HALF OF HIS BODY COULD BE SEEN ALONG WITH HIS HEAD ABOVE IT
WHICH HE LEANT OVER TO ONE SIDE AS HE PEERED OUT AT THE OTHERS
MEANWHILE THE DAY HAD BECOME MUCH LIGHTER PART OF THE ENDLESS
GREY BLACK BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WHICH WAS A
HOSPITAL COULD BE SEEN QUITE CLEARLY WITH THE AUSTERE AND REGULAR
LINE OF WINDOWS PIERCING ITS FACADE THE RAIN WAS STILL
FALLING NOW THROWING DOWN LARGE INDIVIDUAL DROPLETS WHICH HIT THE
GROUND ONE AT A TIME
THE WASHING UP FROM BREAKFAST LAY ON THE
TABLE THERE WAS SO MUCH OF IT BECAUSE FOR GREGOR'S FATHER
BREAKFAST WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY AND HE WOULD
STRETCH IT OUT FOR SEVERAL HOURS AS HE SAT READING A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT NEWSPAPERS
ON THE WALL EXACTLY OPPOSITE THERE WAS
PHOTOGRAPH OF GREGOR WHEN HE WAS A LIEUTENANT IN THE ARMY HIS SWORD
IN HIS HAND AND A CAREFREE SMILE ON HIS FACE AS HE CALLED FORTH
RESPECT FOR HIS UNIFORM AND BEARING
THE DOOR TO THE ENTRANCE HALL
WAS OPEN AND AS THE FRONT DOOR OF THE FLAT WAS ALSO OPEN HE COULD
SEE ONTO THE LANDING AND THE STAIRS WHERE THEY BEGAN THEIR WAY DOWN
BELOW
NOW THEN SAID GREGOR WELL AWARE THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO
HAVE KEPT CALM I'LL GET DRESSED STRAIGHT AWAY NOW PACK UP MY
SAMPLES AND SET OFF
WILL YOU PLEASE JUST LET ME LEAVE YOU CAN
SEE HE SAID TO THE CHIEF CLERK THAT I'M NOT STUBBORN AND I
LIKE TO DO MY JOB BEING A COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER IS ARDUOUS BUT
WITHOUT TRAVELLING I COULDN'T EARN MY LIVING
SO WHERE ARE YOU
GOING IN TO THE OFFICE YES WILL YOU REPORT EVERYTHING ACCURATELY
THEN IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO BE TEMPORARILY UNABLE TO
WORK BUT THAT'S JUST THE RIGHT TIME TO REMEMBER WHAT'S BEEN
ACHIEVED IN THE PAST AND CONSIDER THAT LATER ON ONCE THE DIFFICULTY
HAS BEEN REMOVED HE WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH ALL THE MORE DILIGENCE
AND CONCENTRATION
YOU'RE WELL AWARE THAT I'M SERIOUSLY IN DEBT TO
OUR EMPLOYER AS WELL AS HAVING TO LOOK AFTER MY PARENTS AND MY
SISTER SO THAT I'M TRAPPED IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION BUT I WILL
WORK MY WAY OUT OF IT AGAIN
PLEASE DON'T MAKE THINGS ANY HARDER
FOR ME THAN THEY ARE ALREADY AND DON'T TAKE SIDES AGAINST ME AT THE
OFFICE
I KNOW THAT NOBODY LIKES THE TRAVELLERS
THEY THINK WE
EARN AN ENORMOUS WAGE AS WELL AS HAVING A SOFT TIME OF IT
THAT'S
JUST PREJUDICE BUT THEY HAVE NO PARTICULAR REASON TO THINK BETTER OF
IT
BUT YOU SIR YOU HAVE A BETTER OVERVIEW THAN THE REST OF THE
STAFF IN FACT IF I CAN SAY THIS IN CONFIDENCE A BETTER OVERVIEW
THAN THE BOSS HIMSELF IT'S VERY EASY FOR A BUSINESSMAN LIKE HIM TO
MAKE MISTAKES ABOUT HIS EMPLOYEES AND JUDGE THEM MORE HARSHLY THAN
HE SHOULD
AND YOU'RE ALSO WELL AWARE THAT WE TRAVELLERS SPEND
ALMOST THE WHOLE YEAR AWAY FROM THE OFFICE SO THAT WE CAN VERY
EASILY FALL VICTIM TO GOSSIP AND CHANCE AND GROUNDLESS COMPLAINTS
AND IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM THAT SORT OF
THING WE DON'T USUALLY EVEN HEAR ABOUT THEM OR IF AT ALL IT'S WHEN
WE ARRIVE BACK HOME EXHAUSTED FROM A TRIP AND THAT'S WHEN WE FEEL
THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING
WHAT CAUSED THEM
PLEASE DON'T GO AWAY AT LEAST FIRST SAY
SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT YOU GRANT THAT I'M AT LEAST PARTLY RIGHT
BUT THE CHIEF CLERK HAD TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS GREGOR HAD STARTED TO
SPEAK AND WITH PROTRUDING LIPS ONLY STARED BACK AT HIM OVER HIS
TREMBLING SHOULDERS AS HE LEFT
HE DID NOT KEEP STILL FOR A MOMENT
WHILE GREGOR WAS SPEAKING BUT MOVED STEADILY TOWARDS THE DOOR
WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES OFF HIM
HE MOVED VERY GRADUALLY AS IF
THERE HAD BEEN SOME SECRET PROHIBITION ON LEAVING THE ROOM
IT WAS
ONLY WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE ENTRANCE HALL THAT HE MADE A SUDDEN
MOVEMENT DREW HIS FOOT FROM THE LIVING ROOM AND RUSHED FORWARD IN
A PANIC
IN THE HALL HE STRETCHED HIS RIGHT HAND FAR OUT TOWARDS
THE STAIRWAY AS IF OUT THERE THERE WERE SOME SUPERNATURAL FORCE
WAITING TO SAVE HIM
GREGOR REALISED THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO LET THE CHIEF
CLERK GO AWAY IN THIS MOOD IF HIS POSITION IN THE FIRM WAS NOT TO BE
PUT INTO EXTREME DANGER
THAT WAS SOMETHING HIS PARENTS DID NOT
UNDERSTAND VERY WELL OVER THE YEARS THEY HAD BECOME CONVINCED THAT
THIS JOB WOULD PROVIDE FOR GREGOR FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND BESIDES
THEY HAD SO MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT AT PRESENT THAT THEY HAD LOST SIGHT
OF ANY THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE
GREGOR THOUGH DID THINK ABOUT THE
FUTURE
THE CHIEF CLERK HAD TO BE HELD BACK CALMED DOWN CONVINCED
AND FINALLY WON OVER THE FUTURE OF GREGOR AND HIS FAMILY DEPENDED
ON IT IF ONLY HIS SISTER WERE HERE SHE WAS CLEVER SHE WAS ALREADY
IN TEARS WHILE GREGOR WAS STILL LYING PEACEFULLY ON HIS BACK
AND
THE CHIEF CLERK WAS A LOVER OF WOMEN SURELY SHE COULD PERSUADE HIM
SHE WOULD CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR IN THE ENTRANCE HALL AND TALK HIM OUT
OF HIS SHOCKED STATE
BUT HIS SISTER WAS NOT THERE GREGOR WOULD
HAVE TO DO THE JOB HIMSELF
AND WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT HE STILL
WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH HOW WELL HE COULD MOVE ABOUT IN HIS PRESENT
STATE OR THAT HIS SPEECH STILL MIGHT NOT OR PROBABLY WOULD NOT
BE UNDERSTOOD HE LET GO OF THE DOOR PUSHED HIMSELF THROUGH THE
OPENING TRIED TO REACH THE CHIEF CLERK ON THE LANDING WHO
RIDICULOUSLY WAS HOLDING ON TO THE BANISTER WITH BOTH HANDS BUT
GREGOR FELL IMMEDIATELY OVER AND WITH A LITTLE SCREAM AS HE SOUGHT
SOMETHING TO HOLD ONTO LANDED ON HIS NUMEROUS LITTLE LEGS
HARDLY
HAD THAT HAPPENED THAN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY HE BEGAN TO
FEEL ALRIGHT WITH HIS BODY THE LITTLE LEGS HAD THE SOLID GROUND
UNDER THEM TO HIS PLEASURE THEY DID EXACTLY AS HE TOLD THEM THEY
WERE EVEN MAKING THE EFFORT TO CARRY HIM WHERE HE WANTED TO GO AND
HE WAS SOON BELIEVING THAT ALL HIS SORROWS WOULD SOON BE FINALLY AT
AN END
HE HELD BACK THE URGE TO MOVE BUT SWAYED FROM SIDE TO SIDE
AS HE CROUCHED THERE ON THE FLOOR
HIS MOTHER WAS NOT FAR AWAY IN
FRONT OF HIM AND SEEMED AT FIRST QUITE ENGROSSED IN HERSELF BUT
THEN SHE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP WITH HER ARMS OUTSTRETCHED AND HER
FINGERS SPREAD SHOUTING HELP FOR PITY'S SAKE HELP THE WAY SHE
HELD HER HEAD SUGGESTED SHE WANTED TO SEE GREGOR BETTER BUT THE
UNTHINKING WAY SHE WAS HURRYING BACKWARDS SHOWED THAT SHE DID NOT
SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THAT THE TABLE WAS BEHIND HER WITH ALL THE
BREAKFAST THINGS ON IT WHEN SHE REACHED THE TABLE SHE SAT QUICKLY
DOWN ON IT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS DOING WITHOUT EVEN SEEMING
TO NOTICE THAT THE COFFEE POT HAD BEEN KNOCKED OVER AND A GUSH OF
COFFEE WAS POURING DOWN ONTO THE CARPET
MOTHER MOTHER SAID GREGOR GENTLY LOOKING UP AT HER
HE HAD
COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN THE CHIEF CLERK FOR THE MOMENT BUT COULD NOT
HELP HIMSELF SNAPPING IN THE AIR WITH HIS JAWS AT THE SIGHT OF THE
FLOW OF COFFEE
THAT SET HIS MOTHER SCREAMING ANEW SHE FLED FROM
THE TABLE AND INTO THE ARMS OF HIS FATHER AS HE RUSHED TOWARDS HER
GREGOR THOUGH HAD NO TIME TO SPARE FOR HIS PARENTS NOW THE CHIEF
CLERK HAD ALREADY REACHED THE STAIRS WITH HIS CHIN ON THE BANISTER
HE LOOKED BACK FOR THE LAST TIME
GREGOR MADE A RUN FOR HIM HE
WANTED TO BE SURE OF REACHING HIM THE CHIEF CLERK MUST HAVE
EXPECTED SOMETHING AS HE LEAPT DOWN SEVERAL STEPS AT ONCE AND
DISAPPEARED HIS SHOUTS RESOUNDING ALL AROUND THE STAIRCASE
THE
FLIGHT OF THE CHIEF CLERK SEEMED UNFORTUNATELY TO PUT GREGOR'S
FATHER INTO A PANIC AS WELL
UNTIL THEN HE HAD BEEN RELATIVELY SELF
CONTROLLED BUT NOW INSTEAD OF RUNNING AFTER THE CHIEF CLERK
HIMSELF OR AT LEAST NOT IMPEDING GREGOR AS HE RAN AFTER HIM
GREGOR'S FATHER SEIZED THE CHIEF CLERK'S STICK IN HIS RIGHT HAND
THE CHIEF CLERK HAD LEFT IT BEHIND ON A CHAIR ALONG WITH HIS HAT
AND OVERCOAT PICKED UP A LARGE NEWSPAPER FROM THE TABLE WITH HIS
LEFT AND USED THEM TO DRIVE GREGOR BACK INTO HIS ROOM STAMPING HIS
FOOT AT HIM AS HE WENT
GREGOR'S APPEALS TO HIS FATHER WERE OF NO
HELP HIS APPEALS WERE SIMPLY NOT UNDERSTOOD HOWEVER MUCH HE HUMBLY
TURNED HIS HEAD HIS FATHER MERELY STAMPED HIS FOOT ALL THE HARDER
ACROSS THE ROOM DESPITE THE CHILLY WEATHER GREGOR'S MOTHER HAD
PULLED OPEN A WINDOW LEANT FAR OUT OF IT AND PRESSED HER HANDS TO
HER FACE
A STRONG DRAUGHT OF AIR FLEW IN FROM THE STREET TOWARDS
THE STAIRWAY THE CURTAINS FLEW UP THE NEWSPAPERS ON THE TABLE
FLUTTERED AND SOME OF THEM WERE BLOWN ONTO THE FLOOR
NOTHING WOULD
STOP GREGOR'S FATHER AS HE DROVE HIM BACK MAKING HISSING NOISES AT
HIM LIKE A WILD MAN
GREGOR HAD NEVER HAD ANY PRACTICE IN MOVING
BACKWARDS AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO GO VERY SLOWLY
IF GREGOR HAD ONLY
BEEN ALLOWED TO TURN ROUND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BACK IN HIS ROOM
STRAIGHT AWAY BUT HE WAS AFRAID THAT IF HE TOOK THE TIME TO DO THAT
HIS FATHER WOULD BECOME IMPATIENT AND THERE WAS THE THREAT OF A
LETHAL BLOW TO HIS BACK OR HEAD FROM THE STICK IN HIS FATHER'S HAND
ANY MOMENT
EVENTUALLY THOUGH GREGOR REALISED THAT HE HAD NO
CHOICE AS HE SAW TO HIS DISGUST THAT HE WAS QUITE INCAPABLE OF
GOING BACKWARDS IN A STRAIGHT LINE SO HE BEGAN AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE AND WITH FREQUENT ANXIOUS GLANCES AT HIS FATHER TO TURN
HIMSELF ROUND
IT WENT VERY SLOWLY BUT PERHAPS HIS FATHER WAS ABLE
TO SEE HIS GOOD INTENTIONS AS HE DID NOTHING TO HINDER HIM IN FACT
NOW AND THEN HE USED THE TIP OF HIS STICK TO GIVE DIRECTIONS FROM A
DISTANCE AS TO WHICH WAY TO TURN
IF ONLY HIS FATHER WOULD STOP
THAT UNBEARABLE HISSING IT WAS MAKING GREGOR QUITE CONFUSED
WHEN
HE HAD NEARLY FINISHED TURNING ROUND STILL LISTENING TO THAT
HISSING HE MADE A MISTAKE AND TURNED HIMSELF BACK A LITTLE THE WAY
HE HAD JUST COME
HE WAS PLEASED WHEN HE FINALLY HAD HIS HEAD IN
FRONT OF THE DOORWAY BUT THEN SAW THAT IT WAS TOO NARROW AND HIS
BODY WAS TOO BROAD TO GET THROUGH IT WITHOUT FURTHER DIFFICULTY
IN
HIS PRESENT MOOD IT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT OCCUR TO HIS FATHER TO OPEN
THE OTHER OF THE DOUBLE DOORS SO THAT GREGOR WOULD HAVE ENOUGH SPACE
TO GET THROUGH
HE WAS MERELY FIXED ON THE IDEA THAT GREGOR SHOULD
BE GOT BACK INTO HIS ROOM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
NOR WOULD HE EVER
HAVE ALLOWED GREGOR THE TIME TO GET HIMSELF UPRIGHT AS PREPARATION
FOR GETTING THROUGH THE DOORWAY
WHAT HE DID MAKING MORE NOISE
THAN EVER WAS TO DRIVE GREGOR FORWARDS ALL THE HARDER AS IF THERE
HAD BEEN NOTHING IN THE WAY IT SOUNDED TO GREGOR AS IF THERE WAS
NOW MORE THAN ONE FATHER BEHIND HIM IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT
EXPERIENCE AND GREGOR PUSHED HIMSELF INTO THE DOORWAY WITHOUT
REGARD FOR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
ONE SIDE OF HIS BODY LIFTED ITSELF
HE LAY AT AN ANGLE IN THE DOORWAY ONE FLANK SCRAPED ON THE WHITE
DOOR AND WAS PAINFULLY INJURED LEAVING VILE BROWN FLECKS ON IT
SOON HE WAS STUCK FAST AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE AT ALL
BY HIMSELF THE LITTLE LEGS ALONG ONE SIDE HUNG QUIVERING IN THE AIR
WHILE THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE PRESSED PAINFULLY AGAINST THE
GROUND
THEN HIS FATHER GAVE HIM A HEFTY SHOVE FROM BEHIND WHICH
RELEASED HIM FROM WHERE HE WAS HELD AND SENT HIM FLYING AND HEAVILY
BLEEDING DEEP INTO HIS ROOM
THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED SHUT WITH THE
STICK THEN FINALLY ALL WAS QUIET
II
IT WAS NOT UNTIL IT WAS GETTING DARK THAT EVENING THAT GREGOR AWOKE
FROM HIS DEEP AND COMA LIKE SLEEP
HE WOULD HAVE WOKEN SOON
AFTERWARDS ANYWAY EVEN IF HE HADN'T BEEN DISTURBED AS HE HAD HAD
ENOUGH SLEEP AND FELT FULLY RESTED
BUT HE HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT
SOME HURRIED STEPS AND THE SOUND OF THE DOOR LEADING INTO THE FRONT
ROOM BEING CAREFULLY SHUT HAD WOKEN HIM
THE LIGHT FROM THE
ELECTRIC STREET LAMPS SHONE PALELY HERE AND THERE ONTO THE CEILING
AND TOPS OF THE FURNITURE BUT DOWN BELOW WHERE GREGOR WAS IT WAS
DARK
HE PUSHED HIMSELF OVER TO THE DOOR FEELING HIS WAY CLUMSILY
WITH HIS ANTENNAE OF WHICH HE WAS NOW BEGINNING TO LEARN THE VALUE
IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING THERE
THE WHOLE OF HIS
LEFT SIDE SEEMED LIKE ONE PAINFULLY STRETCHED SCAR AND HE LIMPED
BADLY ON HIS TWO ROWS OF LEGS
ONE OF THE LEGS HAD BEEN BADLY
INJURED IN THE EVENTS OF THAT MORNING IT WAS NEARLY A MIRACLE THAT
ONLY ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN AND DRAGGED ALONG LIFELESSLY
IT WAS ONLY WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE DOOR THAT HE REALISED WHAT IT
ACTUALLY WAS THAT HAD DRAWN HIM OVER TO IT IT WAS THE SMELL OF
SOMETHING TO EAT
BY THE DOOR THERE WAS A DISH FILLED WITH
SWEETENED MILK WITH LITTLE PIECES OF WHITE BREAD FLOATING IN IT
HE
WAS SO PLEASED HE ALMOST LAUGHED AS HE WAS EVEN HUNGRIER THAN HE
HAD BEEN THAT MORNING AND IMMEDIATELY DIPPED HIS HEAD INTO THE
MILK NEARLY COVERING HIS EYES WITH IT
BUT HE SOON DREW HIS HEAD
BACK AGAIN IN DISAPPOINTMENT NOT ONLY DID THE PAIN IN HIS TENDER
LEFT SIDE MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO EAT THE FOOD HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO
EAT IF HIS WHOLE BODY WORKED TOGETHER AS A SNUFFLING WHOLE BUT THE
MILK DID NOT TASTE AT ALL NICE
MILK LIKE THIS WAS NORMALLY HIS
FAVOURITE DRINK AND HIS SISTER HAD CERTAINLY LEFT IT THERE FOR HIM
BECAUSE OF THAT BUT HE TURNED ALMOST AGAINST HIS OWN WILL AWAY
FROM THE DISH AND CRAWLED BACK INTO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE DOOR GREGOR COULD SEE THAT THE GAS HAD
BEEN LIT IN THE LIVING ROOM
HIS FATHER AT THIS TIME WOULD NORMALLY
BE SAT WITH HIS EVENING PAPER READING IT OUT IN A LOUD VOICE TO
GREGOR'S MOTHER AND SOMETIMES TO HIS SISTER BUT THERE WAS NOW NOT
A SOUND TO BE HEARD
GREGOR'S SISTER WOULD OFTEN WRITE AND TELL HIM
ABOUT THIS READING BUT MAYBE HIS FATHER HAD LOST THE HABIT IN
RECENT TIMES
IT WAS SO QUIET ALL AROUND TOO EVEN THOUGH THERE
MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY IN THE FLAT
WHAT A QUIET LIFE IT IS THE
FAMILY LEAD SAID GREGOR TO HIMSELF AND GAZING INTO THE DARKNESS
FELT A GREAT PRIDE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE A LIFE LIKE THAT IN
SUCH A NICE HOME FOR HIS SISTER AND PARENTS
BUT WHAT NOW IF ALL
THIS PEACE AND WEALTH AND COMFORT SHOULD COME TO A HORRIBLE AND
FRIGHTENING END THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT GREGOR DID NOT WANT TO
THINK ABOUT TOO MUCH SO HE STARTED TO MOVE ABOUT CRAWLING UP AND
DOWN THE ROOM
ONCE DURING THAT LONG EVENING THE DOOR ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM WAS
OPENED VERY SLIGHTLY AND HURRIEDLY CLOSED AGAIN LATER ON THE DOOR
ON THE OTHER SIDE DID THE SAME IT SEEMED THAT SOMEONE NEEDED TO
ENTER THE ROOM BUT THOUGHT BETTER OF IT
GREGOR WENT AND WAITED
IMMEDIATELY BY THE DOOR RESOLVED EITHER TO BRING THE TIMOROUS
VISITOR INTO THE ROOM IN SOME WAY OR AT LEAST TO FIND OUT WHO IT
WAS BUT THE DOOR WAS OPENED NO MORE THAT NIGHT AND GREGOR WAITED IN
VAIN
THE PREVIOUS MORNING WHILE THE DOORS WERE LOCKED EVERYONE HAD
WANTED TO GET IN THERE TO HIM BUT NOW NOW THAT HE HAD OPENED UP
ONE OF THE DOORS AND THE OTHER HAD CLEARLY BEEN UNLOCKED SOME TIME
DURING THE DAY NO ONE CAME AND THE KEYS WERE IN THE OTHER SIDES
IT WAS NOT UNTIL LATE AT NIGHT THAT THE GASLIGHT IN THE LIVING ROOM
WAS PUT OUT AND NOW IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT HIS PARENTS AND SISTER HAD
STAYED AWAKE ALL THAT TIME AS THEY ALL COULD BE DISTINCTLY HEARD AS
THEY WENT AWAY TOGETHER ON TIP TOE
IT WAS CLEAR THAT NO ONE WOULD
COME INTO GREGOR'S ROOM ANY MORE UNTIL MORNING THAT GAVE HIM PLENTY
OF TIME TO THINK UNDISTURBED ABOUT HOW HE WOULD HAVE TO RE ARRANGE
HIS LIFE
FOR SOME REASON THE TALL EMPTY ROOM WHERE HE WAS FORCED
TO REMAIN MADE HIM FEEL UNEASY AS HE LAY THERE FLAT ON THE FLOOR
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN LIVING IN IT FOR FIVE YEARS
HARDLY AWARE
OF WHAT HE WAS DOING OTHER THAN A SLIGHT FEELING OF SHAME HE
HURRIED UNDER THE COUCH
IT PRESSED DOWN ON HIS BACK A LITTLE AND
HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO LIFT HIS HEAD BUT HE NONETHELESS FELT
IMMEDIATELY AT EASE AND HIS ONLY REGRET WAS THAT HIS BODY WAS TOO
BROAD TO GET IT ALL UNDERNEATH
HE SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT THERE
SOME OF THE TIME HE PASSED IN A
LIGHT SLEEP ALTHOUGH HE FREQUENTLY WOKE FROM IT IN ALARM BECAUSE OF
HIS HUNGER AND SOME OF THE TIME WAS SPENT IN WORRIES AND VAGUE
HOPES WHICH HOWEVER ALWAYS LED TO THE SAME CONCLUSION FOR THE
TIME BEING HE MUST REMAIN CALM HE MUST SHOW PATIENCE AND THE
GREATEST CONSIDERATION SO THAT HIS FAMILY COULD BEAR THE
UNPLEASANTNESS THAT HE IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION WAS FORCED TO
IMPOSE ON THEM
GREGOR SOON HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE STRENGTH OF HIS
DECISIONS AS EARLY THE NEXT MORNING ALMOST BEFORE THE NIGHT HAD
ENDED HIS SISTER NEARLY FULLY DRESSED OPENED THE DOOR FROM THE
FRONT ROOM AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY IN
SHE DID NOT SEE HIM STRAIGHT
AWAY BUT WHEN SHE DID NOTICE HIM UNDER THE COUCH HE HAD TO BE
SOMEWHERE FOR GOD'S SAKE HE COULDN'T HAVE FLOWN AWAY SHE WAS SO
SHOCKED THAT SHE LOST CONTROL OF HERSELF AND SLAMMED THE DOOR SHUT
AGAIN FROM OUTSIDE
BUT SHE SEEMED TO REGRET HER BEHAVIOUR AS SHE
OPENED THE DOOR AGAIN STRAIGHT AWAY AND CAME IN ON TIP TOE AS IF
ENTERING THE ROOM OF SOMEONE SERIOUSLY ILL OR EVEN OF A STRANGER
GREGOR HAD PUSHED HIS HEAD FORWARD RIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE COUCH
AND WATCHED HER
WOULD SHE NOTICE THAT HE HAD LEFT THE MILK AS IT
WAS REALISE THAT IT WAS NOT FROM ANY LACK OF HUNGER AND BRING HIM
IN SOME OTHER FOOD THAT WAS MORE SUITABLE IF SHE DIDN'T DO IT
HERSELF HE WOULD RATHER GO HUNGRY THAN DRAW HER ATTENTION TO IT
ALTHOUGH HE DID FEEL A TERRIBLE URGE TO RUSH FORWARD FROM UNDER THE
COUCH THROW HIMSELF AT HIS SISTER'S FEET AND BEG HER FOR SOMETHING
GOOD TO EAT
HOWEVER HIS SISTER NOTICED THE FULL DISH IMMEDIATELY
AND LOOKED AT IT AND THE FEW DROPS OF MILK SPLASHED AROUND IT WITH
SOME SURPRISE
SHE IMMEDIATELY PICKED IT UP USING A RAG
NOT HER BARE HANDS AND CARRIED IT OUT
GREGOR WAS EXTREMELY
CURIOUS AS TO WHAT SHE WOULD BRING IN ITS PLACE IMAGINING THE
WILDEST POSSIBILITIES BUT HE NEVER COULD HAVE GUESSED WHAT HIS
SISTER IN HER GOODNESS ACTUALLY DID BRING
IN ORDER TO TEST HIS
TASTE SHE BROUGHT HIM A WHOLE SELECTION OF THINGS ALL SPREAD OUT
ON AN OLD NEWSPAPER
THERE WERE OLD HALF ROTTEN VEGETABLES BONES
FROM THE EVENING MEAL COVERED IN WHITE SAUCE THAT HAD GONE HARD A
FEW RAISINS AND ALMONDS SOME CHEESE THAT GREGOR HAD DECLARED
INEDIBLE TWO DAYS BEFORE A DRY ROLL AND SOME BREAD SPREAD WITH
BUTTER AND SALT
AS WELL AS ALL THAT SHE HAD POURED SOME WATER INTO
THE DISH WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN PERMANENTLY SET ASIDE FOR GREGOR'S
USE AND PLACED IT BESIDE THEM
THEN OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR
GREGOR'S FEELINGS AS SHE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT EAT IN FRONT OF
HER SHE HURRIED OUT AGAIN AND EVEN TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK SO
THAT GREGOR WOULD KNOW HE COULD MAKE THINGS AS COMFORTABLE FOR
HIMSELF AS HE LIKED
GREGOR'S LITTLE LEGS WHIRRED AT LAST HE COULD
EAT
WHAT'S MORE HIS INJURIES MUST ALREADY HAVE COMPLETELY HEALED
AS HE FOUND NO DIFFICULTY IN MOVING
THIS AMAZED HIM AS MORE THAN
A MONTH EARLIER HE HAD CUT HIS FINGER SLIGHTLY WITH A KNIFE HE
THOUGHT OF HOW HIS FINGER HAD STILL HURT THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
AM I LESS SENSITIVE THAN I USED TO BE THEN HE THOUGHT AND WAS
ALREADY SUCKING GREEDILY AT THE CHEESE WHICH HAD IMMEDIATELY ALMOST
COMPELLINGLY ATTRACTED HIM MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER FOODS ON THE
NEWSPAPER
QUICKLY ONE AFTER ANOTHER HIS EYES WATERING WITH
PLEASURE HE CONSUMED THE CHEESE THE VEGETABLES AND THE SAUCE THE
FRESH FOODS ON THE OTHER HAND HE DIDN'T LIKE AT ALL AND EVEN
DRAGGED THE THINGS HE DID WANT TO EAT A LITTLE WAY AWAY FROM THEM
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T STAND THE SMELL
LONG AFTER HE HAD FINISHED
EATING AND LAY LETHARGIC IN THE SAME PLACE HIS SISTER SLOWLY TURNED
THE KEY IN THE LOCK AS A SIGN TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD WITHDRAW
HE
WAS IMMEDIATELY STARTLED ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN HALF ASLEEP AND HE
HURRIED BACK UNDER THE COUCH
BUT HE NEEDED GREAT SELF CONTROL TO
STAY THERE EVEN FOR THE SHORT TIME THAT HIS SISTER WAS IN THE ROOM
AS EATING SO MUCH FOOD HAD ROUNDED OUT HIS BODY A LITTLE AND HE
COULD HARDLY BREATHE IN THAT NARROW SPACE
HALF SUFFOCATING HE
WATCHED WITH BULGING EYES AS HIS SISTER UNSELFCONSCIOUSLY TOOK A
BROOM AND SWEPT UP THE LEFT OVERS MIXING THEM IN WITH THE FOOD HE
HAD NOT EVEN TOUCHED AT ALL AS IF IT COULD NOT BE USED ANY MORE
SHE QUICKLY DROPPED IT ALL INTO A BIN CLOSED IT WITH ITS WOODEN
LID AND CARRIED EVERYTHING OUT
SHE HAD HARDLY TURNED HER BACK
BEFORE GREGOR CAME OUT AGAIN FROM UNDER THE COUCH AND STRETCHED
HIMSELF
THIS WAS HOW GREGOR RECEIVED HIS FOOD EACH DAY NOW ONCE IN THE
MORNING WHILE HIS PARENTS AND THE MAID WERE STILL ASLEEP AND THE
SECOND TIME AFTER EVERYONE HAD EATEN THEIR MEAL AT MIDDAY AS HIS
PARENTS WOULD SLEEP FOR A LITTLE WHILE THEN AS WELL AND GREGOR'S
SISTER WOULD SEND THE MAID AWAY ON SOME ERRAND
GREGOR'S FATHER AND
MOTHER CERTAINLY DID NOT WANT HIM TO STARVE EITHER BUT PERHAPS IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN THEY COULD STAND TO HAVE ANY MORE
EXPERIENCE OF HIS FEEDING THAN BEING TOLD ABOUT IT AND PERHAPS HIS
SISTER WANTED TO SPARE THEM WHAT DISTRESS SHE COULD AS THEY WERE
INDEED SUFFERING ENOUGH
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR GREGOR TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY HAD TOLD THE
DOCTOR AND THE LOCKSMITH THAT FIRST MORNING TO GET THEM OUT OF THE
FLAT
AS NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND HIM NOBODY NOT EVEN HIS SISTER
THOUGHT THAT HE COULD UNDERSTAND THEM SO HE HAD TO BE CONTENT TO
HEAR HIS SISTER'S SIGHS AND APPEALS TO THE SAINTS AS SHE MOVED ABOUT
HIS ROOM
IT WAS ONLY LATER WHEN SHE HAD BECOME A LITTLE MORE USED
TO EVERYTHING THERE WAS OF COURSE NO QUESTION OF HER EVER
BECOMING FULLY USED TO THE SITUATION THAT GREGOR WOULD SOMETIMES
CATCH A FRIENDLY COMMENT OR AT LEAST A COMMENT THAT COULD BE
CONSTRUED AS FRIENDLY
HE'S ENJOYED HIS DINNER TODAY SHE MIGHT
SAY WHEN HE HAD DILIGENTLY CLEARED AWAY ALL THE FOOD LEFT FOR HIM
OR IF HE LEFT MOST OF IT WHICH SLOWLY BECAME MORE AND MORE
FREQUENT SHE WOULD OFTEN SAY SADLY NOW EVERYTHING'S JUST BEEN
LEFT THERE AGAIN
ALTHOUGH GREGOR WASN'T ABLE TO HEAR ANY NEWS DIRECTLY HE DID LISTEN
TO MUCH OF WHAT WAS SAID IN THE NEXT ROOMS AND WHENEVER HE HEARD
ANYONE SPEAKING HE WOULD SCURRY STRAIGHT TO THE APPROPRIATE DOOR AND
PRESS HIS WHOLE BODY AGAINST IT
THERE WAS SELDOM ANY CONVERSATION
ESPECIALLY AT FIRST THAT WAS NOT ABOUT HIM IN SOME WAY EVEN IF
ONLY IN SECRET
FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS ALL THE TALK AT EVERY MEALTIME
WAS ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO NOW BUT EVEN BETWEEN MEALS THEY SPOKE
ABOUT THE SAME SUBJECT AS THERE WERE ALWAYS AT LEAST TWO MEMBERS OF
THE FAMILY AT HOME NOBODY WANTED TO BE AT HOME BY THEMSELVES AND
IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO LEAVE THE FLAT ENTIRELY EMPTY
AND ON
THE VERY FIRST DAY THE MAID HAD FALLEN TO HER KNEES AND BEGGED
GREGOR'S MOTHER TO LET HER GO WITHOUT DELAY
IT WAS NOT VERY CLEAR
HOW MUCH SHE KNEW OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT SHE LEFT WITHIN A QUARTER
OF AN HOUR TEARFULLY THANKING GREGOR'S MOTHER FOR HER DISMISSAL AS
IF SHE HAD DONE HER AN ENORMOUS SERVICE
SHE EVEN SWORE
EMPHATICALLY NOT TO TELL ANYONE THE SLIGHTEST ABOUT WHAT HAD
HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH NO ONE HAD ASKED THAT OF HER
NOW GREGOR'S SISTER ALSO HAD TO HELP HIS MOTHER WITH THE COOKING
ALTHOUGH THAT WAS NOT SO MUCH BOTHER AS NO ONE ATE VERY MUCH
GREGOR OFTEN HEARD HOW ONE OF THEM WOULD UNSUCCESSFULLY URGE ANOTHER
TO EAT AND RECEIVE NO MORE ANSWER THAN NO THANKS I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OR SOMETHING SIMILAR
NO ONE DRANK VERY MUCH EITHER
HIS SISTER
WOULD SOMETIMES ASK HIS FATHER WHETHER HE WOULD LIKE A BEER HOPING
FOR THE CHANCE TO GO AND FETCH IT HERSELF
WHEN HIS FATHER THEN
SAID NOTHING SHE WOULD ADD SO THAT HE WOULD NOT FEEL SELFISH THAT
SHE COULD SEND THE HOUSEKEEPER FOR IT BUT THEN HIS FATHER WOULD
CLOSE THE MATTER WITH A BIG LOUD NO AND NO MORE WOULD BE SAID
EVEN BEFORE THE FIRST DAY HAD COME TO AN END HIS FATHER HAD
EXPLAINED TO GREGOR'S MOTHER AND SISTER WHAT THEIR FINANCES AND
PROSPECTS WERE
NOW AND THEN HE STOOD UP FROM THE TABLE AND TOOK
SOME RECEIPT OR DOCUMENT FROM THE LITTLE CASH BOX HE HAD SAVED FROM
HIS BUSINESS WHEN IT HAD COLLAPSED FIVE YEARS EARLIER
GREGOR HEARD
HOW HE OPENED THE COMPLICATED LOCK AND THEN CLOSED IT AGAIN AFTER HE
HAD TAKEN THE ITEM HE WANTED
WHAT HE HEARD HIS FATHER SAY WAS SOME
OF THE FIRST GOOD NEWS THAT GREGOR HEARD SINCE HE HAD FIRST BEEN
INCARCERATED IN HIS ROOM
HE HAD THOUGHT THAT NOTHING AT ALL
REMAINED FROM HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS AT LEAST HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
ANYTHING DIFFERENT AND GREGOR HAD NEVER ASKED HIM ABOUT IT ANYWAY
THEIR BUSINESS MISFORTUNE HAD REDUCED THE FAMILY TO A STATE OF TOTAL
DESPAIR AND GREGOR'S ONLY CONCERN AT THAT TIME HAD BEEN TO ARRANGE
THINGS SO THAT THEY COULD ALL FORGET ABOUT IT AS QUICKLY AS
POSSIBLE
SO THEN HE STARTED WORKING ESPECIALLY HARD WITH A FIERY
VIGOUR THAT RAISED HIM FROM A JUNIOR SALESMAN TO A TRAVELLING
REPRESENTATIVE ALMOST OVERNIGHT BRINGING WITH IT THE CHANCE TO EARN
MONEY IN QUITE DIFFERENT WAYS
GREGOR CONVERTED HIS SUCCESS AT WORK
STRAIGHT INTO CASH THAT HE COULD LAY ON THE TABLE AT HOME FOR THE
BENEFIT OF HIS ASTONISHED AND DELIGHTED FAMILY
THEY HAD BEEN GOOD
TIMES AND THEY HAD NEVER COME AGAIN AT LEAST NOT WITH THE SAME
SPLENDOUR EVEN THOUGH GREGOR HAD LATER EARNED SO MUCH THAT HE WAS
IN A POSITION TO BEAR THE COSTS OF THE WHOLE FAMILY AND DID BEAR
THEM
THEY HAD EVEN GOT USED TO IT BOTH GREGOR AND THE FAMILY
THEY TOOK THE MONEY WITH GRATITUDE AND HE WAS GLAD TO PROVIDE IT
ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO LONGER MUCH WARM AFFECTION GIVEN IN RETURN
GREGOR ONLY REMAINED CLOSE TO HIS SISTER NOW
UNLIKE HIM SHE WAS
VERY FOND OF MUSIC AND A GIFTED AND EXPRESSIVE VIOLINIST IT WAS HIS
SECRET PLAN TO SEND HER TO THE CONSERVATORY NEXT YEAR EVEN THOUGH IT
WOULD CAUSE GREAT EXPENSE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MADE UP FOR IN SOME
OTHER WAY
DURING GREGOR'S SHORT PERIODS IN TOWN CONVERSATION WITH
HIS SISTER WOULD OFTEN TURN TO THE CONSERVATORY BUT IT WAS ONLY EVER
MENTIONED AS A LOVELY DREAM THAT COULD NEVER BE REALISED
THEIR
PARENTS DID NOT LIKE TO HEAR THIS INNOCENT TALK BUT GREGOR THOUGHT
ABOUT IT QUITE HARD AND DECIDED HE WOULD LET THEM KNOW WHAT HE
PLANNED WITH A GRAND ANNOUNCEMENT OF IT ON CHRISTMAS DAY
THAT WAS THE SORT OF TOTALLY POINTLESS THING THAT WENT THROUGH HIS
MIND IN HIS PRESENT STATE PRESSED UPRIGHT AGAINST THE DOOR AND
LISTENING
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE SIMPLY BECAME TOO TIRED TO
CONTINUE LISTENING WHEN HIS HEAD WOULD FALL WEARILY AGAINST THE
DOOR AND HE WOULD PULL IT UP AGAIN WITH A START AS EVEN THE
SLIGHTEST NOISE HE CAUSED WOULD BE HEARD NEXT DOOR AND THEY WOULD
ALL GO SILENT
WHAT'S THAT HE'S DOING NOW HIS FATHER WOULD SAY
AFTER A WHILE CLEARLY HAVING GONE OVER TO THE DOOR AND ONLY THEN
WOULD THE INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION SLOWLY BE TAKEN UP AGAIN
WHEN EXPLAINING THINGS HIS FATHER REPEATED HIMSELF SEVERAL TIMES
PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH
THESE MATTERS HIMSELF AND PARTLY BECAUSE GREGOR'S MOTHER DID NOT
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THE FIRST TIME
FROM THESE REPEATED EXPLANATIONS
GREGOR LEARNED TO HIS PLEASURE THAT DESPITE ALL THEIR MISFORTUNES
THERE WAS STILL SOME MONEY AVAILABLE FROM THE OLD DAYS
IT WAS NOT
A LOT BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED IN THE MEANTIME AND SOME INTEREST
HAD ACCUMULATED
BESIDES THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN USING UP ALL THE
MONEY THAT GREGOR HAD BEEN BRINGING HOME EVERY MONTH KEEPING ONLY A
LITTLE FOR HIMSELF SO THAT THAT TOO HAD BEEN ACCUMULATING
BEHIND THE DOOR GREGOR NODDED WITH ENTHUSIASM IN HIS PLEASURE AT
THIS UNEXPECTED THRIFT AND CAUTION
HE COULD ACTUALLY HAVE USED
THIS SURPLUS MONEY TO REDUCE HIS FATHER'S DEBT TO HIS BOSS AND THE
DAY WHEN HE COULD HAVE FREED HIMSELF FROM THAT JOB WOULD HAVE COME
MUCH CLOSER BUT NOW IT WAS CERTAINLY BETTER THE WAY HIS FATHER HAD
DONE THINGS
THIS MONEY HOWEVER WAS CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO ENABLE THE FAMILY
TO LIVE OFF THE INTEREST IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THEM FOR
PERHAPS ONE OR TWO YEARS NO MORE
THAT'S TO SAY IT WAS MONEY
THAT SHOULD NOT REALLY BE TOUCHED BUT SET ASIDE FOR EMERGENCIES
MONEY TO LIVE ON HAD TO BE EARNED
HIS FATHER WAS HEALTHY BUT OLD
AND LACKING IN SELF CONFIDENCE
DURING THE FIVE YEARS THAT HE HAD
NOT BEEN WORKING THE FIRST HOLIDAY IN A LIFE THAT HAD BEEN FULL OF
STRAIN AND NO SUCCESS HE HAD PUT ON A LOT OF WEIGHT AND BECOME
VERY SLOW AND CLUMSY
WOULD GREGOR'S ELDERLY MOTHER NOW HAVE TO GO
AND EARN MONEY SHE SUFFERED FROM ASTHMA AND IT WAS A STRAIN FOR HER
JUST TO MOVE ABOUT THE HOME EVERY OTHER DAY WOULD BE SPENT
STRUGGLING FOR BREATH ON THE SOFA BY THE OPEN WINDOW
WOULD HIS
SISTER HAVE TO GO AND EARN MONEY SHE WAS STILL A CHILD OF
SEVENTEEN HER LIFE UP TILL THEN HAD BEEN VERY ENVIABLE CONSISTING
OF WEARING NICE CLOTHES SLEEPING LATE HELPING OUT IN THE BUSINESS
JOINING IN WITH A FEW MODEST PLEASURES AND MOST OF ALL PLAYING THE
VIOLIN
WHENEVER THEY BEGAN TO TALK OF THE NEED TO EARN MONEY
GREGOR WOULD ALWAYS FIRST LET GO OF THE DOOR AND THEN THROW HIMSELF
ONTO THE COOL LEATHER SOFA NEXT TO IT AS HE BECAME QUITE HOT WITH
SHAME AND REGRET
HE WOULD OFTEN LIE THERE THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH NOT SLEEPING A
WINK BUT SCRATCHING AT THE LEATHER FOR HOURS ON END
OR HE MIGHT GO
TO ALL THE EFFORT OF PUSHING A CHAIR TO THE WINDOW CLIMBING UP ONTO
THE SILL AND PROPPED UP IN THE CHAIR LEANING ON THE WINDOW TO
STARE OUT OF IT
HE HAD USED TO FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF FREEDOM FROM
DOING THIS BUT DOING IT NOW WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING MORE REMEMBERED
THAN EXPERIENCED AS WHAT HE ACTUALLY SAW IN THIS WAY WAS BECOMING
LESS DISTINCT EVERY DAY EVEN THINGS THAT WERE QUITE NEAR HE HAD
USED TO CURSE THE EVER PRESENT VIEW OF THE HOSPITAL ACROSS THE
STREET BUT NOW HE COULD NOT SEE IT AT ALL AND IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN
THAT HE LIVED IN CHARLOTTENSTRASSE WHICH WAS A QUIET STREET DESPITE
BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT A BARREN WASTE WHERE THE GREY SKY AND THE
GREY EARTH MINGLED INSEPARABLY
HIS OBSERVANT SISTER ONLY NEEDED TO
NOTICE THE CHAIR TWICE BEFORE SHE WOULD ALWAYS PUSH IT BACK TO ITS
EXACT POSITION BY THE WINDOW AFTER SHE HAD TIDIED UP THE ROOM AND
EVEN LEFT THE INNER PANE OF THE WINDOW OPEN FROM THEN ON
IF GREGOR HAD ONLY BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIS SISTER AND THANK HER
FOR ALL THAT SHE HAD TO DO FOR HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER FOR HIM
TO BEAR IT BUT AS IT WAS IT CAUSED HIM PAIN
HIS SISTER
NATURALLY TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO PRETEND THERE WAS NOTHING
BURDENSOME ABOUT IT AND THE LONGER IT WENT ON OF COURSE THE
BETTER SHE WAS ABLE TO DO SO BUT AS TIME WENT BY GREGOR WAS ALSO
ABLE TO SEE THROUGH IT ALL SO MUCH BETTER
IT HAD EVEN BECOME VERY
UNPLEASANT FOR HIM NOW WHENEVER SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
NO SOONER
HAD SHE COME IN THAN SHE WOULD QUICKLY CLOSE THE DOOR AS A
PRECAUTION SO THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER THE VIEW INTO
GREGOR'S ROOM THEN SHE WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE WINDOW AND PULL IT
HURRIEDLY OPEN ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE SUFFOCATING
EVEN IF IT WAS
COLD SHE WOULD STAY AT THE WINDOW BREATHING DEEPLY FOR A LITTLE
WHILE
SHE WOULD ALARM GREGOR TWICE A DAY WITH THIS RUNNING ABOUT
AND NOISE MAKING HE WOULD STAY UNDER THE COUCH SHIVERING THE WHOLE
WHILE KNOWING FULL WELL THAT SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE LIKED TO
SPARE HIM THIS ORDEAL BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO BE IN THE
SAME ROOM WITH HIM WITH THE WINDOWS CLOSED
ONE DAY ABOUT A MONTH AFTER GREGOR'S TRANSFORMATION WHEN HIS SISTER
NO LONGER HAD ANY PARTICULAR REASON TO BE SHOCKED AT HIS APPEARANCE
SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM A LITTLE EARLIER THAN USUAL AND FOUND HIM
STILL STARING OUT THE WINDOW MOTIONLESS AND JUST WHERE HE WOULD BE
MOST HORRIBLE
IN ITSELF HIS SISTER'S NOT COMING INTO THE ROOM
WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SURPRISE FOR GREGOR AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
DIFFICULT FOR HER TO IMMEDIATELY OPEN THE WINDOW WHILE HE WAS STILL
THERE BUT NOT ONLY DID SHE NOT COME IN SHE WENT STRAIGHT BACK AND
CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER A STRANGER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE HAD
THREATENED HER AND TRIED TO BITE HER
GREGOR WENT STRAIGHT TO HIDE
HIMSELF UNDER THE COUCH OF COURSE BUT HE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MIDDAY
BEFORE HIS SISTER CAME BACK AND SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE UNEASY THAN
USUAL
IT MADE HIM REALISE THAT SHE STILL FOUND HIS APPEARANCE
UNBEARABLE AND WOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO SHE PROBABLY EVEN HAD TO
OVERCOME THE URGE TO FLEE WHEN SHE SAW THE LITTLE BIT OF HIM THAT
PROTRUDED FROM UNDER THE COUCH
ONE DAY IN ORDER TO SPARE HER EVEN
THIS SIGHT HE SPENT FOUR HOURS CARRYING THE BEDSHEET OVER TO THE
COUCH ON HIS BACK AND ARRANGED IT SO THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY COVERED
AND HIS SISTER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE HIM EVEN IF SHE BENT DOWN
IF SHE DID NOT THINK THIS SHEET WAS NECESSARY THEN ALL SHE HAD TO DO
WAS TAKE IT OFF AGAIN AS IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH THAT IT WAS NO
PLEASURE FOR GREGOR TO CUT HIMSELF OFF SO COMPLETELY
SHE LEFT THE
SHEET WHERE IT WAS
GREGOR EVEN THOUGHT HE GLIMPSED A LOOK OF
GRATITUDE ONE TIME WHEN HE CAREFULLY LOOKED OUT FROM UNDER THE SHEET
TO SEE HOW HIS SISTER LIKED THE NEW ARRANGEMENT
FOR THE FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS GREGOR'S PARENTS COULD NOT BRING
THEMSELVES TO COME INTO THE ROOM TO SEE HIM
HE WOULD OFTEN HEAR
THEM SAY HOW THEY APPRECIATED ALL THE NEW WORK HIS SISTER WAS DOING
EVEN THOUGH BEFORE THEY HAD SEEN HER AS A GIRL WHO WAS SOMEWHAT
USELESS AND FREQUENTLY BEEN ANNOYED WITH HER
BUT NOW THE TWO OF
THEM FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD OFTEN BOTH WAIT OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF
GREGOR'S ROOM WHILE HIS SISTER TIDIED UP IN THERE AND AS SOON AS
SHE WENT OUT AGAIN SHE WOULD HAVE TO TELL THEM EXACTLY HOW
EVERYTHING LOOKED WHAT GREGOR HAD EATEN HOW HE HAD BEHAVED THIS
TIME AND WHETHER PERHAPS ANY SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT COULD BE SEEN
HIS MOTHER ALSO WANTED TO GO IN AND VISIT GREGOR RELATIVELY SOON BUT
HIS FATHER AND SISTER AT FIRST PERSUADED HER AGAINST IT
GREGOR
LISTENED VERY CLOSELY TO ALL THIS AND APPROVED FULLY
LATER
THOUGH SHE HAD TO BE HELD BACK BY FORCE WHICH MADE HER CALL OUT
LET ME GO AND SEE GREGOR HE IS MY UNFORTUNATE SON CAN'T YOU
UNDERSTAND I HAVE TO SEE HIM AND GREGOR WOULD THINK TO HIMSELF
THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HIS MOTHER CAME IN NOT EVERY DAY
OF COURSE BUT ONE DAY A WEEK PERHAPS SHE COULD UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING MUCH BETTER THAN HIS SISTER WHO FOR ALL HER COURAGE WAS
STILL JUST A CHILD AFTER ALL AND REALLY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD AN
ADULT'S APPRECIATION OF THE BURDENSOME JOB SHE HAD TAKEN ON
GREGOR'S WISH TO SEE HIS MOTHER WAS SOON REALISED
OUT OF
CONSIDERATION FOR HIS PARENTS GREGOR WANTED TO AVOID BEING SEEN AT
THE WINDOW DURING THE DAY THE FEW SQUARE METERS OF THE FLOOR DID
NOT GIVE HIM MUCH ROOM TO CRAWL ABOUT IT WAS HARD TO JUST LIE
QUIETLY THROUGH THE NIGHT HIS FOOD SOON STOPPED GIVING HIM ANY
PLEASURE AT ALL AND SO TO ENTERTAIN HIMSELF HE GOT INTO THE HABIT
OF CRAWLING UP AND DOWN THE WALLS AND CEILING
HE WAS ESPECIALLY
FOND OF HANGING FROM THE CEILING IT WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM LYING
ON THE FLOOR HE COULD BREATHE MORE FREELY HIS BODY HAD A LIGHT
SWING TO IT AND UP THERE RELAXED AND ALMOST HAPPY IT MIGHT HAPPEN
THAT HE WOULD SURPRISE EVEN HIMSELF BY LETTING GO OF THE CEILING AND
LANDING ON THE FLOOR WITH A CRASH
BUT NOW OF COURSE HE HAD FAR
BETTER CONTROL OF HIS BODY THAN BEFORE AND EVEN WITH A FALL AS
GREAT AS THAT CAUSED HIMSELF NO DAMAGE
VERY SOON HIS SISTER
NOTICED GREGOR'S NEW WAY OF ENTERTAINING HIMSELF HE HAD AFTER
ALL LEFT TRACES OF THE ADHESIVE FROM HIS FEET AS HE CRAWLED ABOUT
AND GOT IT INTO HER HEAD TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR HIM BY
REMOVING THE FURNITURE THAT GOT IN HIS WAY ESPECIALLY THE CHEST OF
DRAWERS AND THE DESK
NOW THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHE WOULD BE
ABLE TO DO BY HERSELF SHE DID NOT DARE TO ASK FOR HELP FROM HER
FATHER THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD MAID HAD CARRIED ON BRAVELY SINCE THE
COOK HAD LEFT BUT SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE HELPED IN THIS SHE
HAD EVEN ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO KEEP THE KITCHEN LOCKED AT ALL TIMES
AND NEVER TO HAVE TO OPEN THE DOOR UNLESS IT WAS ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT SO HIS SISTER HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO CHOOSE SOME TIME WHEN
GREGOR'S FATHER WAS NOT THERE AND FETCH HIS MOTHER TO HELP HER
AS
SHE APPROACHED THE ROOM GREGOR COULD HEAR HIS MOTHER EXPRESS HER
JOY BUT ONCE AT THE DOOR SHE WENT SILENT
FIRST OF COURSE HIS
SISTER CAME IN AND LOOKED ROUND TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM
WAS ALRIGHT AND ONLY THEN DID SHE LET HER MOTHER ENTER
GREGOR HAD
HURRIEDLY PULLED THE SHEET DOWN LOWER OVER THE COUCH AND PUT MORE
FOLDS INTO IT SO THAT EVERYTHING REALLY LOOKED AS IF IT HAD JUST
BEEN THROWN DOWN BY CHANCE
GREGOR ALSO REFRAINED THIS TIME FROM
SPYING OUT FROM UNDER THE SHEET HE GAVE UP THE CHANCE TO SEE HIS
MOTHER UNTIL LATER AND WAS SIMPLY GLAD THAT SHE HAD COME
YOU CAN
COME IN HE CAN'T BE SEEN SAID HIS SISTER OBVIOUSLY LEADING HER
IN BY THE HAND
THE OLD CHEST OF DRAWERS WAS TOO HEAVY FOR A PAIR
OF FEEBLE WOMEN TO BE HEAVING ABOUT BUT GREGOR LISTENED AS THEY
PUSHED IT FROM ITS PLACE HIS SISTER ALWAYS TAKING ON THE HEAVIEST
PART OF THE WORK FOR HERSELF AND IGNORING HER MOTHER'S WARNINGS THAT
SHE WOULD STRAIN HERSELF
THIS LASTED A VERY LONG TIME
AFTER
LABOURING AT IT FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES OR MORE HIS MOTHER SAID IT WOULD
BE BETTER TO LEAVE THE CHEST WHERE IT WAS FOR ONE THING IT WAS TOO
HEAVY FOR THEM TO GET THE JOB FINISHED BEFORE GREGOR'S FATHER GOT
HOME AND LEAVING IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM IT WOULD BE IN HIS WAY
EVEN MORE AND FOR ANOTHER THING IT WASN'T EVEN SURE THAT TAKING THE
FURNITURE AWAY WOULD REALLY BE ANY HELP TO HIM
SHE THOUGHT JUST
THE OPPOSITE THE SIGHT OF THE BARE WALLS SADDENED HER RIGHT TO HER
HEART AND WHY WOULDN'T GREGOR FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT HE'D BEEN
USED TO THIS FURNITURE IN HIS ROOM FOR A LONG TIME AND IT WOULD MAKE
HIM FEEL ABANDONED TO BE IN AN EMPTY ROOM LIKE THAT
THEN QUIETLY
ALMOST WHISPERING AS IF WANTING GREGOR WHOSE WHEREABOUTS SHE DID
NOT KNOW TO HEAR NOT EVEN THE TONE OF HER VOICE AS SHE WAS
CONVINCED THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER WORDS SHE ADDED AND BY
TAKING THE FURNITURE AWAY WON'T IT SEEM LIKE WE'RE SHOWING THAT
WE'VE GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF IMPROVEMENT AND WE'RE ABANDONING HIM TO
COPE FOR HIMSELF I THINK IT'D BE BEST TO LEAVE THE ROOM EXACTLY THE
WAY IT WAS BEFORE SO THAT WHEN GREGOR COMES BACK TO US AGAIN HE'LL
FIND EVERYTHING UNCHANGED AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO FORGET THE TIME IN
BETWEEN ALL THE EASIER
HEARING THESE WORDS FROM HIS MOTHER MADE GREGOR REALISE THAT THE
LACK OF ANY DIRECT HUMAN COMMUNICATION ALONG WITH THE MONOTONOUS
LIFE LED BY THE FAMILY DURING THESE TWO MONTHS MUST HAVE MADE HIM
CONFUSED HE COULD THINK OF NO OTHER WAY OF EXPLAINING TO HIMSELF
WHY HE HAD SERIOUSLY WANTED HIS ROOM EMPTIED OUT
HAD HE REALLY
WANTED TO TRANSFORM HIS ROOM INTO A CAVE A WARM ROOM FITTED OUT
WITH THE NICE FURNITURE HE HAD INHERITED THAT WOULD HAVE LET HIM
CRAWL AROUND UNIMPEDED IN ANY DIRECTION BUT IT WOULD ALSO HAVE LET
HIM QUICKLY FORGET HIS PAST WHEN HE HAD STILL BEEN HUMAN
HE HAD
COME VERY CLOSE TO FORGETTING AND IT HAD ONLY BEEN THE VOICE OF HIS
MOTHER UNHEARD FOR SO LONG THAT HAD SHAKEN HIM OUT OF IT
NOTHING
SHOULD BE REMOVED EVERYTHING HAD TO STAY HE COULD NOT DO WITHOUT
THE GOOD INFLUENCE THE FURNITURE HAD ON HIS CONDITION AND IF THE
FURNITURE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO CRAWL ABOUT MINDLESSLY THAT
WAS NOT A LOSS BUT A GREAT ADVANTAGE
HIS SISTER UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT AGREE SHE HAD BECOME USED TO THE
IDEA NOT WITHOUT REASON THAT SHE WAS GREGOR'S SPOKESMAN TO HIS
PARENTS ABOUT THE THINGS THAT CONCERNED HIM
THIS MEANT THAT HIS
MOTHER'S ADVICE NOW WAS SUFFICIENT REASON FOR HER TO INSIST ON
REMOVING NOT ONLY THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND THE DESK AS SHE HAD
THOUGHT AT FIRST BUT ALL THE FURNITURE APART FROM THE ALL IMPORTANT
COUCH
IT WAS MORE THAN CHILDISH PERVERSITY OF COURSE OR THE
UNEXPECTED CONFIDENCE SHE HAD RECENTLY ACQUIRED THAT MADE HER
INSIST SHE HAD INDEED NOTICED THAT GREGOR NEEDED A LOT OF ROOM TO
CRAWL ABOUT IN WHEREAS THE FURNITURE AS FAR AS ANYONE COULD SEE
WAS OF NO USE TO HIM AT ALL
GIRLS OF THAT AGE THOUGH DO BECOME
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THINGS AND FEEL THEY MUST GET THEIR WAY WHENEVER
THEY CAN
PERHAPS THIS WAS WHAT TEMPTED GRETE TO MAKE GREGOR'S
SITUATION SEEM EVEN MORE SHOCKING THAN IT WAS SO THAT SHE COULD DO
EVEN MORE FOR HIM
GRETE WOULD PROBABLY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO WOULD
DARE ENTER A ROOM DOMINATED BY GREGOR CRAWLING ABOUT THE BARE WALLS
BY HIMSELF
SO SHE REFUSED TO LET HER MOTHER DISSUADE HER
GREGOR'S MOTHER
ALREADY LOOKED UNEASY IN HIS ROOM SHE SOON STOPPED SPEAKING AND
HELPED GREGOR'S SISTER TO GET THE CHEST OF DRAWERS OUT WITH WHAT
STRENGTH SHE HAD
THE CHEST OF DRAWERS WAS SOMETHING THAT GREGOR
COULD DO WITHOUT IF HE HAD TO BUT THE WRITING DESK HAD TO STAY
HARDLY HAD THE TWO WOMEN PUSHED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS GROANING OUT
OF THE ROOM THAN GREGOR POKED HIS HEAD OUT FROM UNDER THE COUCH TO
SEE WHAT HE COULD DO ABOUT IT
HE MEANT TO BE AS CAREFUL AND
CONSIDERATE AS HE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS HIS MOTHER WHO
CAME BACK FIRST WHILE GRETE IN THE NEXT ROOM HAD HER ARMS ROUND THE
CHEST PUSHING AND PULLING AT IT FROM SIDE TO SIDE BY HERSELF
WITHOUT OF COURSE MOVING IT AN INCH
HIS MOTHER WAS NOT USED TO
THE SIGHT OF GREGOR HE MIGHT HAVE MADE HER ILL SO GREGOR HURRIED
BACKWARDS TO THE FAR END OF THE COUCH
IN HIS STARTLEMENT THOUGH
HE WAS NOT ABLE TO PREVENT THE SHEET AT ITS FRONT FROM MOVING A
LITTLE
IT WAS ENOUGH TO ATTRACT HIS MOTHER'S ATTENTION
SHE STOOD
VERY STILL REMAINED THERE A MOMENT AND THEN WENT BACK OUT TO
GRETE
GREGOR KEPT TRYING TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS
HAPPENING IT WAS JUST A FEW PIECES OF FURNITURE BEING MOVED AFTER
ALL BUT HE SOON HAD TO ADMIT THAT THE WOMEN GOING TO AND FRO THEIR
LITTLE CALLS TO EACH OTHER THE SCRAPING OF THE FURNITURE ON THE
FLOOR ALL THESE THINGS MADE HIM FEEL AS IF HE WERE BEING ASSAILED
FROM ALL SIDES
WITH HIS HEAD AND LEGS PULLED IN AGAINST HIM AND
HIS BODY PRESSED TO THE FLOOR HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT TO HIMSELF
THAT HE COULD NOT STAND ALL OF THIS MUCH LONGER
THEY WERE EMPTYING
HIS ROOM OUT TAKING AWAY EVERYTHING THAT WAS DEAR TO HIM THEY HAD
ALREADY TAKEN OUT THE CHEST CONTAINING HIS FRETSAW AND OTHER TOOLS
NOW THEY THREATENED TO REMOVE THE WRITING DESK WITH ITS PLACE
CLEARLY WORN INTO THE FLOOR THE DESK WHERE HE HAD DONE HIS HOMEWORK
AS A BUSINESS TRAINEE AT HIGH SCHOOL EVEN WHILE HE HAD BEEN AT
INFANT SCHOOL HE REALLY COULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER TO SEE WHETHER
THE TWO WOMEN'S INTENTIONS WERE GOOD
HE HAD NEARLY FORGOTTEN THEY
WERE THERE ANYWAY AS THEY WERE NOW TOO TIRED TO SAY ANYTHING WHILE
THEY WORKED AND HE COULD ONLY HEAR THEIR FEET AS THEY STEPPED
HEAVILY ON THE FLOOR
SO WHILE THE WOMEN WERE LEANT AGAINST THE DESK IN THE OTHER ROOM
CATCHING THEIR BREATH HE SALLIED OUT CHANGED DIRECTION FOUR TIMES
NOT KNOWING WHAT HE SHOULD SAVE FIRST BEFORE HIS ATTENTION WAS
SUDDENLY CAUGHT BY THE PICTURE ON THE WALL WHICH WAS ALREADY
DENUDED OF EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAD BEEN ON IT OF THE LADY DRESSED
IN COPIOUS FUR
HE HURRIED UP ONTO THE PICTURE AND PRESSED HIMSELF
AGAINST ITS GLASS IT HELD HIM FIRMLY AND FELT GOOD ON HIS HOT
BELLY
THIS PICTURE AT LEAST NOW TOTALLY COVERED BY GREGOR WOULD
CERTAINLY BE TAKEN AWAY BY NO ONE
HE TURNED HIS HEAD TO FACE THE
DOOR INTO THE LIVING ROOM SO THAT HE COULD WATCH THE WOMEN WHEN THEY
CAME BACK
THEY HAD NOT ALLOWED THEMSELVES A LONG REST AND CAME BACK QUITE
SOON GRETE HAD PUT HER ARM AROUND HER MOTHER AND WAS NEARLY
CARRYING HER
WHAT SHALL WE TAKE NOW THEN SAID GRETE AND
LOOKED AROUND
HER EYES MET THOSE OF GREGOR ON THE WALL
PERHAPS
ONLY BECAUSE HER MOTHER WAS THERE SHE REMAINED CALM BENT HER FACE
TO HER SO THAT SHE WOULD NOT LOOK ROUND AND SAID ALBEIT HURRIEDLY
AND WITH A TREMOR IN HER VOICE COME ON LET'S GO BACK IN THE
LIVING ROOM FOR A WHILE GREGOR COULD SEE WHAT GRETE HAD IN MIND
SHE WANTED TO TAKE HER MOTHER SOMEWHERE SAFE AND THEN CHASE HIM DOWN
FROM THE WALL
WELL SHE COULD CERTAINLY TRY IT HE SAT UNYIELDING
ON HIS PICTURE
HE WOULD RATHER JUMP AT GRETE'S FACE
BUT GRETE'S WORDS HAD MADE HER MOTHER QUITE WORRIED SHE STEPPED TO
ONE SIDE SAW THE ENORMOUS BROWN PATCH AGAINST THE FLOWERS OF THE
WALLPAPER AND BEFORE SHE EVEN REALISED IT WAS GREGOR THAT SHE SAW
SCREAMED OH GOD OH GOD ARMS OUTSTRETCHED SHE FELL ONTO THE
COUCH AS IF SHE HAD GIVEN UP EVERYTHING AND STAYED THERE IMMOBILE
GREGOR SHOUTED HIS SISTER GLOWERING AT HIM AND SHAKING HER FIST
THAT WAS THE FIRST WORD SHE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM DIRECTLY SINCE HIS
TRANSFORMATION
SHE RAN INTO THE OTHER ROOM TO FETCH SOME KIND OF
SMELLING SALTS TO BRING HER MOTHER OUT OF HER FAINT GREGOR WANTED
TO HELP TOO HE COULD SAVE HIS PICTURE LATER ALTHOUGH HE STUCK
FAST TO THE GLASS AND HAD TO PULL HIMSELF OFF BY FORCE THEN HE
TOO RAN INTO THE NEXT ROOM AS IF HE COULD ADVISE HIS SISTER LIKE IN
THE OLD DAYS BUT HE HAD TO JUST STAND BEHIND HER DOING NOTHING SHE
WAS LOOKING INTO VARIOUS BOTTLES HE STARTLED HER WHEN SHE TURNED
ROUND A BOTTLE FELL TO THE GROUND AND BROKE A SPLINTER CUT
GREGOR'S FACE SOME KIND OF CAUSTIC MEDICINE SPLASHED ALL OVER HIM
NOW WITHOUT DELAYING ANY LONGER GRETE TOOK HOLD OF ALL THE BOTTLES
SHE COULD AND RAN WITH THEM IN TO HER MOTHER SHE SLAMMED THE DOOR
SHUT WITH HER FOOT
SO NOW GREGOR WAS SHUT OUT FROM HIS MOTHER
WHO BECAUSE OF HIM MIGHT BE NEAR TO DEATH HE COULD NOT OPEN THE
DOOR IF HE DID NOT WANT TO CHASE HIS SISTER AWAY AND SHE HAD TO
STAY WITH HIS MOTHER THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO BUT WAIT AND
OPPRESSED WITH ANXIETY AND SELF REPROACH HE BEGAN TO CRAWL ABOUT
HE CRAWLED OVER EVERYTHING WALLS FURNITURE CEILING AND FINALLY
IN HIS CONFUSION AS THE WHOLE ROOM BEGAN TO SPIN AROUND HIM HE FELL
DOWN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DINNER TABLE
HE LAY THERE FOR A WHILE NUMB AND IMMOBILE ALL AROUND HIM IT WAS
QUIET MAYBE THAT WAS A GOOD SIGN
THEN THERE WAS SOMEONE AT THE
DOOR
THE MAID OF COURSE HAD LOCKED HERSELF IN HER KITCHEN SO
THAT GRETE WOULD HAVE TO GO AND ANSWER IT
HIS FATHER HAD ARRIVED
HOME
WHAT'S HAPPENED WERE HIS FIRST WORDS GRETE'S APPEARANCE
MUST HAVE MADE EVERYTHING CLEAR TO HIM
SHE ANSWERED HIM WITH
SUBDUED VOICE AND OPENLY PRESSED HER FACE INTO HIS CHEST MOTHER'S
FAINTED BUT SHE'S BETTER NOW
GREGOR GOT OUT JUST AS I
EXPECTED SAID HIS FATHER JUST AS I ALWAYS SAID BUT YOU WOMEN
WOULDN'T LISTEN WOULD YOU IT WAS CLEAR TO GREGOR THAT GRETE HAD
NOT SAID ENOUGH AND THAT HIS FATHER TOOK IT TO MEAN THAT SOMETHING
BAD HAD HAPPENED THAT HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME ACT OF VIOLENCE
THAT MEANT GREGOR WOULD NOW HAVE TO TRY TO CALM HIS FATHER AS HE
DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO EXPLAIN THINGS TO HIM EVEN IF THAT HAD BEEN
POSSIBLE
SO HE FLED TO THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM AND PRESSED HIMSELF
AGAINST IT SO THAT HIS FATHER WHEN HE CAME IN FROM THE HALL COULD
SEE STRAIGHT AWAY THAT GREGOR HAD THE BEST INTENTIONS AND WOULD GO
BACK INTO HIS ROOM WITHOUT DELAY THAT IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO
DRIVE HIM BACK BUT THAT THEY HAD ONLY TO OPEN THE DOOR AND HE WOULD
DISAPPEAR
HIS FATHER THOUGH WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO NOTICE SUBTLETIES LIKE
THAT AH HE SHOUTED AS HE CAME IN SOUNDING AS IF HE WERE BOTH
ANGRY AND GLAD AT THE SAME TIME
GREGOR DREW HIS HEAD BACK FROM THE
DOOR AND LIFTED IT TOWARDS HIS FATHER
HE REALLY HAD NOT IMAGINED
HIS FATHER THE WAY HE STOOD THERE NOW OF LATE WITH HIS NEW HABIT
OF CRAWLING ABOUT HE HAD NEGLECTED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS
GOING ON THE REST OF THE FLAT THE WAY HE HAD DONE BEFORE
HE REALLY
OUGHT TO HAVE EXPECTED THINGS TO HAVE CHANGED BUT STILL STILL WAS
THAT REALLY HIS FATHER THE SAME TIRED MAN AS USED TO BE LAYING
THERE ENTOMBED IN HIS BED WHEN GREGOR CAME BACK FROM HIS BUSINESS
TRIPS WHO WOULD RECEIVE HIM SITTING IN THE ARMCHAIR IN HIS
NIGHTGOWN WHEN HE CAME BACK IN THE EVENINGS WHO WAS HARDLY EVEN
ABLE TO STAND UP BUT AS A SIGN OF HIS PLEASURE WOULD JUST RAISE
HIS ARMS AND WHO ON THE COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR WHEN THEY WENT FOR A
WALK TOGETHER ON A SUNDAY OR PUBLIC HOLIDAY WRAPPED UP TIGHTLY IN
HIS OVERCOAT BETWEEN GREGOR AND HIS MOTHER WOULD ALWAYS LABOUR HIS
WAY FORWARD A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY THAN THEM WHO WERE ALREADY WALKING
SLOWLY FOR HIS SAKE WHO WOULD PLACE HIS STICK DOWN CAREFULLY AND
IF HE WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING WOULD INVARIABLY STOP AND GATHER HIS
COMPANIONS AROUND HIM
HE WAS STANDING UP STRAIGHT ENOUGH NOW
DRESSED IN A SMART BLUE UNIFORM WITH GOLD BUTTONS THE SORT WORN BY
THE EMPLOYEES AT THE BANKING INSTITUTE ABOVE THE HIGH STIFF COLLAR
OF THE COAT HIS STRONG DOUBLE CHIN EMERGED UNDER THE BUSHY
EYEBROWS HIS PIERCING DARK EYES LOOKED OUT FRESH AND ALERT HIS
NORMALLY UNKEMPT WHITE HAIR WAS COMBED DOWN PAINFULLY CLOSE TO HIS
SCALP
HE TOOK HIS CAP WITH ITS GOLD MONOGRAM FROM PROBABLY SOME
BANK AND THREW IT IN AN ARC RIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM ONTO THE SOFA
PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS TROUSER POCKETS PUSHING BACK THE BOTTOM OF HIS
LONG UNIFORM COAT AND WITH LOOK OF DETERMINATION WALKED TOWARDS
GREGOR
HE PROBABLY DID NOT EVEN KNOW HIMSELF WHAT HE HAD IN MIND
BUT NONETHELESS LIFTED HIS FEET UNUSUALLY HIGH
GREGOR WAS AMAZED
AT THE ENORMOUS SIZE OF THE SOLES OF HIS BOOTS BUT WASTED NO TIME
WITH THAT HE KNEW FULL WELL RIGHT FROM THE FIRST DAY OF HIS NEW
LIFE THAT HIS FATHER THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO ALWAYS BE EXTREMELY
STRICT WITH HIM
AND SO HE RAN UP TO HIS FATHER STOPPED WHEN HIS
FATHER STOPPED SCURRIED FORWARDS AGAIN WHEN HE MOVED EVEN
SLIGHTLY
IN THIS WAY THEY WENT ROUND THE ROOM SEVERAL TIMES
WITHOUT ANYTHING DECISIVE HAPPENING WITHOUT EVEN GIVING THE
IMPRESSION OF A CHASE AS EVERYTHING WENT SO SLOWLY
GREGOR REMAINED
ALL THIS TIME ON THE FLOOR LARGELY BECAUSE HE FEARED HIS FATHER
MIGHT SEE IT AS ESPECIALLY PROVOKING IF HE FLED ONTO THE WALL OR
CEILING
WHATEVER HE DID GREGOR HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE CERTAINLY
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP THIS RUNNING ABOUT FOR LONG AS FOR
EACH STEP HIS FATHER TOOK HE HAD TO CARRY OUT COUNTLESS MOVEMENTS
HE BECAME NOTICEABLY SHORT OF BREATH EVEN IN HIS EARLIER LIFE HIS
LUNGS HAD NOT BEEN VERY RELIABLE
NOW AS HE LURCHED ABOUT IN HIS
EFFORTS TO MUSTER ALL THE STRENGTH HE COULD FOR RUNNING HE COULD
HARDLY KEEP HIS EYES OPEN HIS THOUGHTS BECAME TOO SLOW FOR HIM TO
THINK OF ANY OTHER WAY OF SAVING HIMSELF THAN RUNNING HE ALMOST
FORGOT THAT THE WALLS WERE THERE FOR HIM TO USE ALTHOUGH HERE THEY
WERE CONCEALED BEHIND CAREFULLY CARVED FURNITURE FULL OF NOTCHES AND
PROTRUSIONS THEN RIGHT BESIDE HIM LIGHTLY TOSSED SOMETHING FLEW
DOWN AND ROLLED IN FRONT OF HIM
IT WAS AN APPLE THEN ANOTHER ONE
IMMEDIATELY FLEW AT HIM GREGOR FROZE IN SHOCK THERE WAS NO LONGER
ANY POINT IN RUNNING AS HIS FATHER HAD DECIDED TO BOMBARD HIM
HE
HAD FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH FRUIT FROM THE BOWL ON THE SIDEBOARD AND
NOW WITHOUT EVEN TAKING THE TIME FOR CAREFUL AIM THREW ONE APPLE
AFTER ANOTHER
THESE LITTLE RED APPLES ROLLED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR
KNOCKING INTO EACH OTHER AS IF THEY HAD ELECTRIC MOTORS
AN APPLE
THROWN WITHOUT MUCH FORCE GLANCED AGAINST GREGOR'S BACK AND SLID OFF
WITHOUT DOING ANY HARM
ANOTHER ONE HOWEVER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
IT HIT SQUARELY AND LODGED IN HIS BACK GREGOR WANTED TO DRAG
HIMSELF AWAY AS IF HE COULD REMOVE THE SURPRISING THE INCREDIBLE
PAIN BY CHANGING HIS POSITION BUT HE FELT AS IF NAILED TO THE SPOT
AND SPREAD HIMSELF OUT ALL HIS SENSES IN CONFUSION
THE LAST THING
HE SAW WAS THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM BEING PULLED OPEN HIS SISTER WAS
SCREAMING HIS MOTHER RAN OUT IN FRONT OF HER IN HER BLOUSE AS HIS
SISTER HAD TAKEN OFF SOME OF HER CLOTHES AFTER SHE HAD FAINTED TO
MAKE IT EASIER FOR HER TO BREATHE SHE RAN TO HIS FATHER HER
SKIRTS UNFASTENED AND SLIDING ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE GROUND
STUMBLING OVER THE SKIRTS SHE PUSHED HERSELF TO HIS FATHER HER ARMS
AROUND HIM UNITING HERSELF WITH HIM TOTALLY NOW GREGOR LOST HIS
ABILITY TO SEE ANYTHING HER HANDS BEHIND HIS FATHER'S HEAD BEGGING
HIM TO SPARE GREGOR'S LIFE
III
NO ONE DARED TO REMOVE THE APPLE LODGED IN GREGOR'S FLESH SO IT
REMAINED THERE AS A VISIBLE REMINDER OF HIS INJURY
HE HAD SUFFERED
IT THERE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH AND HIS CONDITION SEEMED SERIOUS
ENOUGH TO REMIND EVEN HIS FATHER THAT GREGOR DESPITE HIS CURRENT
SAD AND REVOLTING FORM WAS A FAMILY MEMBER WHO COULD NOT BE TREATED
AS AN ENEMY
ON THE CONTRARY AS A FAMILY THERE WAS A DUTY TO
SWALLOW ANY REVULSION FOR HIM AND TO BE PATIENT JUST TO BE PATIENT
BECAUSE OF HIS INJURIES GREGOR HAD LOST MUCH OF HIS MOBILITY
PROBABLY PERMANENTLY
HE HAD BEEN REDUCED TO THE CONDITION OF AN
ANCIENT INVALID AND IT TOOK HIM LONG LONG MINUTES TO CRAWL ACROSS
HIS ROOM CRAWLING OVER THE CEILING WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT
THIS DETERIORATION IN HIS CONDITION WAS FULLY IN HIS OPINION MADE
UP FOR BY THE DOOR TO THE LIVING ROOM BEING LEFT OPEN EVERY EVENING
HE GOT INTO THE HABIT OF CLOSELY WATCHING IT FOR ONE OR TWO HOURS
BEFORE IT WAS OPENED AND THEN LYING IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS ROOM
WHERE HE COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM THE LIVING ROOM HE COULD WATCH THE
FAMILY IN THE LIGHT OF THE DINNER TABLE AND LISTEN TO THEIR
CONVERSATION WITH EVERYONE'S PERMISSION IN A WAY AND THUS QUITE
DIFFERENTLY FROM BEFORE
THEY NO LONGER HELD THE LIVELY CONVERSATIONS OF EARLIER TIMES OF
COURSE THE ONES THAT GREGOR ALWAYS THOUGHT ABOUT WITH LONGING WHEN
HE WAS TIRED AND GETTING INTO THE DAMP BED IN SOME SMALL HOTEL ROOM
ALL OF THEM WERE USUALLY VERY QUIET NOWADAYS
SOON AFTER DINNER
HIS FATHER WOULD GO TO SLEEP IN HIS CHAIR HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
WOULD URGE EACH OTHER TO BE QUIET HIS MOTHER BENT DEEPLY UNDER THE
LAMP WOULD SEW FANCY UNDERWEAR FOR A FASHION SHOP HIS SISTER WHO
HAD TAKEN A SALES JOB LEARNED SHORTHAND AND FRENCH IN THE EVENINGS
SO THAT SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A BETTER POSITION LATER ON
SOMETIMES HIS FATHER WOULD WAKE UP AND SAY TO GREGOR'S MOTHER
YOU'RE DOING SO MUCH SEWING AGAIN TODAY AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW
THAT HE HAD BEEN DOZING AND THEN HE WOULD GO BACK TO SLEEP AGAIN
WHILE MOTHER AND SISTER WOULD EXCHANGE A TIRED GRIN
WITH A KIND OF STUBBORNNESS GREGOR'S FATHER REFUSED TO TAKE HIS
UNIFORM OFF EVEN AT HOME WHILE HIS NIGHTGOWN HUNG UNUSED ON ITS PEG
GREGOR'S FATHER WOULD SLUMBER WHERE HE WAS FULLY DRESSED AS IF
ALWAYS READY TO SERVE AND EXPECTING TO HEAR THE VOICE OF HIS
SUPERIOR EVEN HERE
THE UNIFORM HAD NOT BEEN NEW TO START WITH BUT
AS A RESULT OF THIS IT SLOWLY BECAME EVEN SHABBIER DESPITE THE
EFFORTS OF GREGOR'S MOTHER AND SISTER TO LOOK AFTER IT
GREGOR
WOULD OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE EVENING LOOKING AT ALL THE STAINS ON
THIS COAT WITH ITS GOLD BUTTONS ALWAYS KEPT POLISHED AND SHINY
WHILE THE OLD MAN IN IT WOULD SLEEP HIGHLY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT
PEACEFUL
AS SOON AS IT STRUCK TEN GREGOR'S MOTHER WOULD SPEAK GENTLY TO HIS
FATHER TO WAKE HIM AND TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO GO TO BED AS HE
COULDN'T SLEEP PROPERLY WHERE HE WAS AND HE REALLY HAD TO GET HIS
SLEEP IF HE WAS TO BE UP AT SIX TO GET TO WORK
BUT SINCE HE HAD
BEEN IN WORK HE HAD BECOME MORE OBSTINATE AND WOULD ALWAYS INSIST ON
STAYING LONGER AT THE TABLE EVEN THOUGH HE REGULARLY FELL ASLEEP
AND IT WAS THEN HARDER THAN EVER TO PERSUADE HIM TO EXCHANGE THE
CHAIR FOR HIS BED
THEN HOWEVER MUCH MOTHER AND SISTER WOULD
IMPORTUNE HIM WITH LITTLE REPROACHES AND WARNINGS HE WOULD KEEP
SLOWLY SHAKING HIS HEAD FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH HIS EYES
CLOSED AND REFUSING TO GET UP
GREGOR'S MOTHER WOULD TUG AT HIS
SLEEVE WHISPER ENDEARMENTS INTO HIS EAR GREGOR'S SISTER WOULD
LEAVE HER WORK TO HELP HER MOTHER BUT NOTHING WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT
ON HIM
HE WOULD JUST SINK DEEPER INTO HIS CHAIR
ONLY WHEN THE
TWO WOMEN TOOK HIM UNDER THE ARMS HE WOULD ABRUPTLY OPEN HIS EYES
LOOK AT THEM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AND SAY WHAT A LIFE THIS IS WHAT
PEACE I GET IN MY OLD AGE AND SUPPORTED BY THE TWO WOMEN HE WOULD
LIFT HIMSELF UP CAREFULLY AS IF HE WERE CARRYING THE GREATEST LOAD
HIMSELF LET THE WOMEN TAKE HIM TO THE DOOR SEND THEM OFF AND CARRY
ON BY HIMSELF WHILE GREGOR'S MOTHER WOULD THROW DOWN HER NEEDLE AND
HIS SISTER HER PEN SO THAT THEY COULD RUN AFTER HIS FATHER AND
CONTINUE BEING OF HELP TO HIM
WHO IN THIS TIRED AND OVERWORKED FAMILY WOULD HAVE HAD TIME TO
GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO GREGOR THAN WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THE
HOUSEHOLD BUDGET BECAME EVEN SMALLER SO NOW THE MAID WAS DISMISSED
AN ENORMOUS THICK BONED CHARWOMAN WITH WHITE HAIR THAT FLAPPED
AROUND HER HEAD CAME EVERY MORNING AND EVENING TO DO THE HEAVIEST
WORK EVERYTHING ELSE WAS LOOKED AFTER BY GREGOR'S MOTHER ON TOP OF
THE LARGE AMOUNT OF SEWING WORK SHE DID
GREGOR EVEN LEARNED
LISTENING TO THE EVENING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT PRICE THEY HAD
HOPED FOR THAT SEVERAL ITEMS OF JEWELLERY BELONGING TO THE FAMILY
HAD BEEN SOLD EVEN THOUGH BOTH MOTHER AND SISTER HAD BEEN VERY FOND
OF WEARING THEM AT FUNCTIONS AND CELEBRATIONS
BUT THE LOUDEST
COMPLAINT WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THE FLAT WAS MUCH TOO BIG FOR THEIR
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY COULD NOT MOVE OUT OF IT THERE WAS NO
IMAGINABLE WAY OF TRANSFERRING GREGOR TO THE NEW ADDRESS
HE COULD
SEE QUITE WELL THOUGH THAT THERE WERE MORE REASONS THAN
CONSIDERATION FOR HIM THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MOVE IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EASY TO TRANSPORT HIM IN ANY SUITABLE CRATE
WITH A FEW AIR HOLES IN IT THE MAIN THING HOLDING THE FAMILY BACK
FROM THEIR DECISION TO MOVE WAS MUCH MORE TO DO WITH THEIR TOTAL
DESPAIR AND THE THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD BEEN STRUCK WITH A MISFORTUNE
UNLIKE ANYTHING EXPERIENCED BY ANYONE ELSE THEY KNEW OR WERE RELATED
TO
THEY CARRIED OUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT THE WORLD EXPECTS
FROM POOR PEOPLE GREGOR'S FATHER BROUGHT BANK EMPLOYEES THEIR
BREAKFAST HIS MOTHER SACRIFICED HERSELF BY WASHING CLOTHES FOR
STRANGERS HIS SISTER RAN BACK AND FORTH BEHIND HER DESK AT THE
BEHEST OF THE CUSTOMERS BUT THEY JUST DID NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO
DO ANY MORE
AND THE INJURY IN GREGOR'S BACK BEGAN TO HURT AS MUCH
AS WHEN IT WAS NEW
AFTER THEY HAD COME BACK FROM TAKING HIS FATHER
TO BED GREGOR'S MOTHER AND SISTER WOULD NOW LEAVE THEIR WORK WHERE
IT WAS AND SIT CLOSE TOGETHER CHEEK TO CHEEK HIS MOTHER WOULD
POINT TO GREGOR'S ROOM AND SAY CLOSE THAT DOOR GRETE AND THEN
WHEN HE WAS IN THE DARK AGAIN THEY WOULD SIT IN THE NEXT ROOM AND
THEIR TEARS WOULD MINGLE OR THEY WOULD SIMPLY SIT THERE STARING
DRY EYED AT THE TABLE
GREGOR HARDLY SLEPT AT ALL EITHER NIGHT OR DAY
SOMETIMES HE WOULD
THINK OF TAKING OVER THE FAMILY'S AFFAIRS JUST LIKE BEFORE THE
NEXT TIME THE DOOR WAS OPENED HE HAD LONG FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIS BOSS
AND THE CHIEF CLERK BUT THEY WOULD APPEAR AGAIN IN HIS THOUGHTS
THE SALESMEN AND THE APPRENTICES THAT STUPID TEABOY TWO OR THREE
FRIENDS FROM OTHER BUSINESSES ONE OF THE CHAMBERMAIDS FROM A
PROVINCIAL HOTEL A TENDER MEMORY THAT APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED
AGAIN A CASHIER FROM A HAT SHOP FOR WHOM HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN
SERIOUS BUT TOO SLOW ALL OF THEM APPEARED TO HIM MIXED TOGETHER
WITH STRANGERS AND OTHERS HE HAD FORGOTTEN BUT INSTEAD OF HELPING
HIM AND HIS FAMILY THEY WERE ALL OF THEM INACCESSIBLE AND HE WAS
GLAD WHEN THEY DISAPPEARED
OTHER TIMES HE WAS NOT AT ALL IN THE
MOOD TO LOOK AFTER HIS FAMILY HE WAS FILLED WITH SIMPLE RAGE ABOUT
THE LACK OF ATTENTION HE WAS SHOWN AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD THINK OF
NOTHING HE WOULD HAVE WANTED HE MADE PLANS OF HOW HE COULD GET INTO
THE PANTRY WHERE HE COULD TAKE ALL THE THINGS HE WAS ENTITLED TO
EVEN IF HE WAS NOT HUNGRY
GREGOR'S SISTER NO LONGER THOUGHT ABOUT
HOW SHE COULD PLEASE HIM BUT WOULD HURRIEDLY PUSH SOME FOOD OR OTHER
INTO HIS ROOM WITH HER FOOT BEFORE SHE RUSHED OUT TO WORK IN THE
MORNING AND AT MIDDAY AND IN THE EVENING SHE WOULD SWEEP IT AWAY
AGAIN WITH THE BROOM INDIFFERENT AS TO WHETHER IT HAD BEEN EATEN OR
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HAD BEEN LEFT TOTALLY UNTOUCHED
SHE STILL
CLEARED UP THE ROOM IN THE EVENING BUT NOW SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
ANY QUICKER ABOUT IT
SMEARS OF DIRT WERE LEFT ON THE WALLS HERE
AND THERE WERE LITTLE BALLS OF DUST AND FILTH
AT FIRST GREGOR
WENT INTO ONE OF THE WORST OF THESE PLACES WHEN HIS SISTER ARRIVED
AS A REPROACH TO HER BUT HE COULD HAVE STAYED THERE FOR WEEKS
WITHOUT HIS SISTER DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT SHE COULD SEE THE DIRT
AS WELL AS HE COULD BUT SHE HAD SIMPLY DECIDED TO LEAVE HIM TO IT
AT THE SAME TIME SHE BECAME TOUCHY IN A WAY THAT WAS QUITE NEW FOR
HER AND WHICH EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY UNDERSTOOD CLEANING UP
GREGOR'S ROOM WAS FOR HER AND HER ALONE
GREGOR'S MOTHER DID ONCE
THOROUGHLY CLEAN HIS ROOM AND NEEDED TO USE SEVERAL BUCKETFULS OF
WATER TO DO IT ALTHOUGH THAT MUCH DAMPNESS ALSO MADE GREGOR ILL
AND HE LAY FLAT ON THE COUCH BITTER AND IMMOBILE
BUT HIS MOTHER
WAS TO BE PUNISHED STILL MORE FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE AS HARDLY HAD
HIS SISTER ARRIVED HOME IN THE EVENING THAN SHE NOTICED THE CHANGE
IN GREGOR'S ROOM AND HIGHLY AGGRIEVED RAN BACK INTO THE LIVING
ROOM WHERE DESPITE HER MOTHERS RAISED AND IMPLORING HANDS SHE
BROKE INTO CONVULSIVE TEARS
HER FATHER OF COURSE WAS STARTLED
OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND THE TWO PARENTS LOOKED ON ASTONISHED AND
HELPLESS THEN THEY TOO BECAME AGITATED GREGOR'S FATHER STANDING
TO THE RIGHT OF HIS MOTHER ACCUSED HER OF NOT LEAVING THE CLEANING
OF GREGOR'S ROOM TO HIS SISTER FROM HER LEFT GREGOR'S SISTER
SCREAMED AT HER THAT SHE WAS NEVER TO CLEAN GREGOR'S ROOM AGAIN
WHILE HIS MOTHER TRIED TO DRAW HIS FATHER WHO WAS BESIDE HIMSELF
WITH ANGER INTO THE BEDROOM HIS SISTER QUAKING WITH TEARS
THUMPED ON THE TABLE WITH HER SMALL FISTS AND GREGOR HISSED IN
ANGER THAT NO ONE HAD EVEN THOUGHT OF CLOSING THE DOOR TO SAVE HIM
THE SIGHT OF THIS AND ALL ITS NOISE
GREGOR'S SISTER WAS EXHAUSTED FROM GOING OUT TO WORK AND LOOKING
AFTER GREGOR AS SHE HAD DONE BEFORE WAS EVEN MORE WORK FOR HER BUT
EVEN SO HIS MOTHER OUGHT CERTAINLY NOT TO HAVE TAKEN HER PLACE
GREGOR ON THE OTHER HAND OUGHT NOT TO BE NEGLECTED
NOW THOUGH
THE CHARWOMAN WAS HERE
THIS ELDERLY WIDOW WITH A ROBUST BONE
STRUCTURE THAT MADE HER ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE HARDEST OF THINGS IN
HER LONG LIFE WASN'T REALLY REPELLED BY GREGOR
JUST BY CHANCE ONE
DAY RATHER THAN ANY REAL CURIOSITY SHE OPENED THE DOOR TO GREGOR'S
ROOM AND FOUND HERSELF FACE TO FACE WITH HIM
HE WAS TAKEN TOTALLY
BY SURPRISE NO ONE WAS CHASING HIM BUT HE BEGAN TO RUSH TO AND FRO
WHILE SHE JUST STOOD THERE IN AMAZEMENT WITH HER HANDS CROSSED IN
FRONT OF HER
FROM THEN ON SHE NEVER FAILED TO OPEN THE DOOR
SLIGHTLY EVERY EVENING AND MORNING AND LOOK BRIEFLY IN ON HIM
AT
FIRST SHE WOULD CALL TO HIM AS SHE DID SO WITH WORDS THAT SHE
PROBABLY CONSIDERED FRIENDLY SUCH AS COME ON THEN YOU OLD
DUNG BEETLE OR LOOK AT THE OLD DUNG BEETLE THERE GREGOR NEVER
RESPONDED TO BEING SPOKEN TO IN THAT WAY BUT JUST REMAINED WHERE HE
WAS WITHOUT MOVING AS IF THE DOOR HAD NEVER EVEN BEEN OPENED
IF
ONLY THEY HAD TOLD THIS CHARWOMAN TO CLEAN UP HIS ROOM EVERY DAY
INSTEAD OF LETTING HER DISTURB HIM FOR NO REASON WHENEVER SHE FELT
LIKE IT ONE DAY EARLY IN THE MORNING WHILE A HEAVY RAIN STRUCK THE
WINDOWPANES PERHAPS INDICATING THAT SPRING WAS COMING SHE BEGAN TO
SPEAK TO HIM IN THAT WAY ONCE AGAIN
GREGOR WAS SO RESENTFUL OF IT
THAT HE STARTED TO MOVE TOWARD HER HE WAS SLOW AND INFIRM BUT IT
WAS LIKE A KIND OF ATTACK
INSTEAD OF BEING AFRAID THE CHARWOMAN
JUST LIFTED UP ONE OF THE CHAIRS FROM NEAR THE DOOR AND STOOD THERE
WITH HER MOUTH OPEN CLEARLY INTENDING NOT TO CLOSE HER MOUTH UNTIL
THE CHAIR IN HER HAND HAD BEEN SLAMMED DOWN INTO GREGOR'S BACK
AREN'T YOU COMING ANY CLOSER THEN SHE ASKED WHEN GREGOR TURNED
ROUND AGAIN AND SHE CALMLY PUT THE CHAIR BACK IN THE CORNER
GREGOR HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY STOPPED EATING
ONLY IF HE HAPPENED TO
FIND HIMSELF NEXT TO THE FOOD THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED FOR HIM HE
MIGHT TAKE SOME OF IT INTO HIS MOUTH TO PLAY WITH IT LEAVE IT THERE
A FEW HOURS AND THEN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT SPIT IT OUT AGAIN
AT
FIRST HE THOUGHT IT WAS DISTRESS AT THE STATE OF HIS ROOM THAT
STOPPED HIM EATING BUT HE HAD SOON GOT USED TO THE CHANGES MADE
THERE
THEY HAD GOT INTO THE HABIT OF PUTTING THINGS INTO THIS ROOM
THAT THEY HAD NO ROOM FOR ANYWHERE ELSE AND THERE WERE NOW MANY
SUCH THINGS AS ONE OF THE ROOMS IN THE FLAT HAD BEEN RENTED OUT TO
THREE GENTLEMEN
THESE EARNEST GENTLEMEN ALL THREE OF THEM HAD
FULL BEARDS AS GREGOR LEARNED PEERING THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE DOOR
ONE DAY WERE PAINFULLY INSISTENT ON THINGS' BEING TIDY
THIS
MEANT NOT ONLY IN THEIR OWN ROOM BUT SINCE THEY HAD TAKEN A ROOM IN
THIS ESTABLISHMENT IN THE ENTIRE FLAT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE
KITCHEN
UNNECESSARY CLUTTER WAS SOMETHING THEY COULD NOT TOLERATE
ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS DIRTY
THEY HAD MOREOVER BROUGHT MOST OF THEIR
OWN FURNISHINGS AND EQUIPMENT WITH THEM
FOR THIS REASON MANY
THINGS HAD BECOME SUPERFLUOUS WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY COULD NOT BE
SOLD THE FAMILY DID NOT WISH TO DISCARD
ALL THESE THINGS FOUND
THEIR WAY INTO GREGOR'S ROOM
THE DUSTBINS FROM THE KITCHEN FOUND
THEIR WAY IN THERE TOO
THE CHARWOMAN WAS ALWAYS IN A HURRY AND
ANYTHING SHE COULDN'T USE FOR THE TIME BEING SHE WOULD JUST CHUCK IN
THERE
HE FORTUNATELY WOULD USUALLY SEE NO MORE THAN THE OBJECT
AND THE HAND THAT HELD IT
THE WOMAN MOST LIKELY MEANT TO FETCH THE
THINGS BACK OUT AGAIN WHEN SHE HAD TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY OR TO
THROW EVERYTHING OUT IN ONE GO BUT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS THAT
THEY WERE LEFT WHERE THEY LANDED WHEN THEY HAD FIRST BEEN THROWN
UNLESS GREGOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE JUNK AND MOVED IT SOMEWHERE
ELSE
AT FIRST HE MOVED IT BECAUSE WITH NO OTHER ROOM FREE WHERE
HE COULD CRAWL ABOUT HE WAS FORCED TO BUT LATER ON HE CAME TO
ENJOY IT ALTHOUGH MOVING ABOUT IN THAT WAY LEFT HIM SAD AND TIRED TO
DEATH AND HE WOULD REMAIN IMMOBILE FOR HOURS AFTERWARDS
THE GENTLEMEN WHO RENTED THE ROOM WOULD SOMETIMES TAKE THEIR EVENING
MEAL AT HOME IN THE LIVING ROOM THAT WAS USED BY EVERYONE AND SO
THE DOOR TO THIS ROOM WAS OFTEN KEPT CLOSED IN THE EVENING
BUT
GREGOR FOUND IT EASY TO GIVE UP HAVING THE DOOR OPEN HE HAD AFTER
ALL OFTEN FAILED TO MAKE USE OF IT WHEN IT WAS OPEN AND WITHOUT
THE FAMILY HAVING NOTICED IT LAIN IN HIS ROOM IN ITS DARKEST
CORNER
ONE TIME THOUGH THE CHARWOMAN LEFT THE DOOR TO THE LIVING
ROOM SLIGHTLY OPEN AND IT REMAINED OPEN WHEN THE GENTLEMEN WHO
RENTED THE ROOM CAME IN IN THE EVENING AND THE LIGHT WAS PUT ON
THEY SAT UP AT THE TABLE WHERE FORMERLY GREGOR HAD TAKEN HIS MEALS
WITH HIS FATHER AND MOTHER THEY UNFOLDED THE SERVIETTES AND PICKED
UP THEIR KNIVES AND FORKS
GREGOR'S MOTHER IMMEDIATELY APPEARED IN
THE DOORWAY WITH A DISH OF MEAT AND SOON BEHIND HER CAME HIS SISTER
WITH A DISH PILED HIGH WITH POTATOES
THE FOOD WAS STEAMING AND
FILLED THE ROOM WITH ITS SMELL
THE GENTLEMEN BENT OVER THE DISHES
SET IN FRONT OF THEM AS IF THEY WANTED TO TEST THE FOOD BEFORE
EATING IT AND THE GENTLEMAN IN THE MIDDLE WHO SEEMED TO COUNT AS
AN AUTHORITY FOR THE OTHER TWO DID INDEED CUT OFF A PIECE OF MEAT
WHILE IT WAS STILL IN ITS DISH CLEARLY WISHING TO ESTABLISH WHETHER
IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COOKED OR WHETHER IT SHOULD BE SENT BACK TO THE
KITCHEN
IT WAS TO HIS SATISFACTION AND GREGOR'S MOTHER AND
SISTER WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON ANXIOUSLY BEGAN TO BREATHE AGAIN
AND SMILED
THE FAMILY THEMSELVES ATE IN THE KITCHEN
NONETHELESS GREGOR'S
FATHER CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM BEFORE HE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN
BOWED ONCE WITH HIS CAP IN HIS HAND AND DID HIS ROUND OF THE TABLE
THE GENTLEMEN STOOD AS ONE AND MUMBLED SOMETHING INTO THEIR BEARDS
THEN ONCE THEY WERE ALONE THEY ATE IN NEAR PERFECT SILENCE
IT
SEEMED REMARKABLE TO GREGOR THAT ABOVE ALL THE VARIOUS NOISES OF
EATING THEIR CHEWING TEETH COULD STILL BE HEARD AS IF THEY HAD
WANTED TO SHOW GREGOR THAT YOU NEED TEETH IN ORDER TO EAT AND IT WAS
NOT POSSIBLE TO PERFORM ANYTHING WITH JAWS THAT ARE TOOTHLESS
HOWEVER NICE THEY MIGHT BE
I'D LIKE TO EAT SOMETHING SAID
GREGOR ANXIOUSLY BUT NOT ANYTHING LIKE THEY'RE EATING
THEY DO
FEED THEMSELVES
AND HERE I AM DYING
THROUGHOUT ALL THIS TIME GREGOR COULD NOT REMEMBER HAVING HEARD THE
VIOLIN BEING PLAYED BUT THIS EVENING IT BEGAN TO BE HEARD FROM THE
KITCHEN
THE THREE GENTLEMEN HAD ALREADY FINISHED THEIR MEAL THE
ONE IN THE MIDDLE HAD PRODUCED A NEWSPAPER GIVEN A PAGE TO EACH OF
THE OTHERS AND NOW THEY LEANT BACK IN THEIR CHAIRS READING THEM AND
SMOKING
WHEN THE VIOLIN BEGAN PLAYING THEY BECAME ATTENTIVE STOOD
UP AND WENT ON TIP TOE OVER TO THE DOOR OF THE HALLWAY WHERE THEY
STOOD PRESSED AGAINST EACH OTHER
SOMEONE MUST HAVE HEARD THEM IN
THE KITCHEN AS GREGOR'S FATHER CALLED OUT IS THE PLAYING PERHAPS
UNPLEASANT FOR THE GENTLEMEN WE CAN STOP IT STRAIGHT AWAY ON
THE CONTRARY SAID THE MIDDLE GENTLEMAN WOULD THE YOUNG LADY NOT
LIKE TO COME IN AND PLAY FOR US HERE IN THE ROOM WHERE IT IS AFTER
ALL MUCH MORE COSY AND COMFORTABLE OH YES WE'D LOVE TO
CALLED BACK GREGOR'S FATHER AS IF HE HAD BEEN THE VIOLIN PLAYER
HIMSELF
THE GENTLEMEN STEPPED BACK INTO THE ROOM AND WAITED
GREGOR'S FATHER SOON APPEARED WITH THE MUSIC STAND HIS MOTHER WITH
THE MUSIC AND HIS SISTER WITH THE VIOLIN
SHE CALMLY PREPARED
EVERYTHING FOR HER TO BEGIN PLAYING HIS PARENTS WHO HAD NEVER
RENTED A ROOM OUT BEFORE AND THEREFORE SHOWED AN EXAGGERATED
COURTESY TOWARDS THE THREE GENTLEMEN DID NOT EVEN DARE TO SIT ON
THEIR OWN CHAIRS HIS FATHER LEANT AGAINST THE DOOR WITH HIS RIGHT
HAND PUSHED IN BETWEEN TWO BUTTONS ON HIS UNIFORM COAT HIS MOTHER
THOUGH WAS OFFERED A SEAT BY ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN AND SAT LEAVING
THE CHAIR WHERE THE GENTLEMAN HAPPENED TO HAVE PLACED IT OUT OF
THE WAY IN A CORNER
HIS SISTER BEGAN TO PLAY FATHER AND MOTHER PAID CLOSE ATTENTION
ONE ON EACH SIDE TO THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HANDS
DRAWN IN BY THE
PLAYING GREGOR HAD DARED TO COME FORWARD A LITTLE AND ALREADY HAD
HIS HEAD IN THE LIVING ROOM
BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN GREAT PRIDE IN
HOW CONSIDERATE HE WAS BUT NOW IT HARDLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE HAD
BECOME SO THOUGHTLESS ABOUT THE OTHERS
WHAT'S MORE THERE WAS NOW
ALL THE MORE REASON TO KEEP HIMSELF HIDDEN AS HE WAS COVERED IN THE
DUST THAT LAY EVERYWHERE IN HIS ROOM AND FLEW UP AT THE SLIGHTEST
MOVEMENT HE CARRIED THREADS HAIRS AND REMAINS OF FOOD ABOUT ON
HIS BACK AND SIDES HE WAS MUCH TOO INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING NOW TO
LAY ON HIS BACK AND WIPE HIMSELF ON THE CARPET LIKE HE HAD USED TO
DO SEVERAL TIMES A DAY
AND DESPITE THIS CONDITION HE WAS NOT TOO
SHY TO MOVE FORWARD A LITTLE ONTO THE IMMACULATE FLOOR OF THE LIVING
ROOM
NO ONE NOTICED HIM THOUGH
THE FAMILY WAS TOTALLY PREOCCUPIED WITH
THE VIOLIN PLAYING AT FIRST THE THREE GENTLEMEN HAD PUT THEIR
HANDS IN THEIR POCKETS AND COME UP FAR TOO CLOSE BEHIND THE MUSIC
STAND TO LOOK AT ALL THE NOTES BEING PLAYED AND THEY MUST HAVE
DISTURBED GREGOR'S SISTER BUT SOON IN CONTRAST WITH THE FAMILY
THEY WITHDREW BACK TO THE WINDOW WITH THEIR HEADS SUNK AND TALKING
TO EACH OTHER AT HALF VOLUME AND THEY STAYED BY THE WINDOW WHILE
GREGOR'S FATHER OBSERVED THEM ANXIOUSLY
IT REALLY NOW SEEMED VERY
OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAD EXPECTED TO HEAR SOME BEAUTIFUL OR
ENTERTAINING VIOLIN PLAYING BUT HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY HAD
HAD ENOUGH OF THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE AND IT WAS ONLY NOW OUT OF
POLITENESS THAT THEY ALLOWED THEIR PEACE TO BE DISTURBED
IT WAS
ESPECIALLY UNNERVING THE WAY THEY ALL BLEW THE SMOKE FROM THEIR
CIGARETTES UPWARDS FROM THEIR MOUTH AND NOSES
YET GREGOR'S SISTER
WAS PLAYING SO BEAUTIFULLY
HER FACE WAS LEANT TO ONE SIDE
FOLLOWING THE LINES OF MUSIC WITH A CAREFUL AND MELANCHOLY
EXPRESSION
GREGOR CRAWLED A LITTLE FURTHER FORWARD KEEPING HIS
HEAD CLOSE TO THE GROUND SO THAT HE COULD MEET HER EYES IF THE
CHANCE CAME
WAS HE AN ANIMAL IF MUSIC COULD CAPTIVATE HIM SO IT
SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS BEING SHOWN THE WAY TO THE UNKNOWN
NOURISHMENT HE HAD BEEN YEARNING FOR
HE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE HIS
WAY FORWARD TO HIS SISTER AND TUG AT HER SKIRT TO SHOW HER SHE MIGHT
COME INTO HIS ROOM WITH HER VIOLIN AS NO ONE APPRECIATED HER
PLAYING HERE AS MUCH AS HE WOULD
HE NEVER WANTED TO LET HER OUT OF
HIS ROOM NOT WHILE HE LIVED ANYWAY HIS SHOCKING APPEARANCE
SHOULD FOR ONCE BE OF SOME USE TO HIM HE WANTED TO BE AT EVERY
DOOR OF HIS ROOM AT ONCE TO HISS AND SPIT AT THE ATTACKERS HIS
SISTER SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO STAY WITH HIM THOUGH BUT STAY OF
HER OWN FREE WILL SHE WOULD SIT BESIDE HIM ON THE COUCH WITH HER
EAR BENT DOWN TO HIM WHILE HE TOLD HER HOW HE HAD ALWAYS INTENDED TO
SEND HER TO THE CONSERVATORY HOW HE WOULD HAVE TOLD EVERYONE ABOUT
IT LAST CHRISTMAS HAD CHRISTMAS REALLY COME AND GONE ALREADY IF
THIS MISFORTUNE HADN'T GOT IN THE WAY AND REFUSE TO LET ANYONE
DISSUADE HIM FROM IT
ON HEARING ALL THIS HIS SISTER WOULD BREAK
OUT IN TEARS OF EMOTION AND GREGOR WOULD CLIMB UP TO HER SHOULDER
AND KISS HER NECK WHICH SINCE SHE HAD BEEN GOING OUT TO WORK SHE
HAD KEPT FREE WITHOUT ANY NECKLACE OR COLLAR
MR
SAMSA SHOUTED THE MIDDLE GENTLEMAN TO GREGOR'S FATHER
POINTING WITHOUT WASTING ANY MORE WORDS WITH HIS FOREFINGER AT
GREGOR AS HE SLOWLY MOVED FORWARD
THE VIOLIN WENT SILENT THE
MIDDLE OF THE THREE GENTLEMEN FIRST SMILED AT HIS TWO FRIENDS
SHAKING HIS HEAD AND THEN LOOKED BACK AT GREGOR
HIS FATHER SEEMED
TO THINK IT MORE IMPORTANT TO CALM THE THREE GENTLEMEN BEFORE
DRIVING GREGOR OUT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT AT ALL UPSET AND
SEEMED TO THINK GREGOR WAS MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THE VIOLIN PLAYING
HAD BEEN
HE RUSHED UP TO THEM WITH HIS ARMS SPREAD OUT AND
ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THEM BACK INTO THEIR ROOM AT THE SAME TIME AS
TRYING TO BLOCK THEIR VIEW OF GREGOR WITH HIS BODY
NOW THEY DID
BECOME A LITTLE ANNOYED AND IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT WAS HIS
FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR THAT ANNOYED THEM OR THE DAWNING REALISATION THAT
THEY HAD HAD A NEIGHBOUR LIKE GREGOR IN THE NEXT ROOM WITHOUT
KNOWING IT
THEY ASKED GREGOR'S FATHER FOR EXPLANATIONS RAISED
THEIR ARMS LIKE HE HAD TUGGED EXCITEDLY AT THEIR BEARDS AND MOVED
BACK TOWARDS THEIR ROOM ONLY VERY SLOWLY
MEANWHILE GREGOR'S SISTER
HAD OVERCOME THE DESPAIR SHE HAD FALLEN INTO WHEN HER PLAYING WAS
SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED
SHE HAD LET HER HANDS DROP AND LET VIOLIN AND
BOW HANG LIMPLY FOR A WHILE BUT CONTINUED TO LOOK AT THE MUSIC AS IF
STILL PLAYING BUT THEN SHE SUDDENLY PULLED HERSELF TOGETHER LAY
THE INSTRUMENT ON HER MOTHER'S LAP WHO STILL SAT LABORIOUSLY
STRUGGLING FOR BREATH WHERE SHE WAS AND RAN INTO THE NEXT ROOM
WHICH UNDER PRESSURE FROM HER FATHER THE THREE GENTLEMEN WERE MORE
QUICKLY MOVING TOWARD
UNDER HIS SISTER'S EXPERIENCED HAND THE
PILLOWS AND COVERS ON THE BEDS FLEW UP AND WERE PUT INTO ORDER AND
SHE HAD ALREADY FINISHED MAKING THE BEDS AND SLIPPED OUT AGAIN
BEFORE THE THREE GENTLEMEN HAD REACHED THE ROOM
GREGOR'S FATHER
SEEMED SO OBSESSED WITH WHAT HE WAS DOING THAT HE FORGOT ALL THE
RESPECT HE OWED TO HIS TENANTS
HE URGED THEM AND PRESSED THEM
UNTIL WHEN HE WAS ALREADY AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM THE MIDDLE OF
THE THREE GENTLEMEN SHOUTED LIKE THUNDER AND STAMPED HIS FOOT AND
THEREBY BROUGHT GREGOR'S FATHER TO A HALT
I DECLARE HERE AND
NOW HE SAID RAISING HIS HAND AND GLANCING AT GREGOR'S MOTHER AND
SISTER TO GAIN THEIR ATTENTION TOO THAT WITH REGARD TO THE
REPUGNANT CONDITIONS THAT PREVAIL IN THIS FLAT AND WITH THIS FAMILY
HERE HE LOOKED BRIEFLY BUT DECISIVELY AT THE FLOOR I GIVE
IMMEDIATE NOTICE ON MY ROOM
FOR THE DAYS THAT I HAVE BEEN LIVING
HERE I WILL OF COURSE PAY NOTHING AT ALL ON THE CONTRARY I WILL
CONSIDER WHETHER TO PROCEED WITH SOME KIND OF ACTION FOR DAMAGES
FROM YOU AND BELIEVE ME IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO SET OUT THE
GROUNDS FOR SUCH AN ACTION HE WAS SILENT AND LOOKED STRAIGHT
AHEAD AS IF WAITING FOR SOMETHING
AND INDEED HIS TWO FRIENDS
JOINED IN WITH THE WORDS AND WE ALSO GIVE IMMEDIATE NOTICE WITH
THAT HE TOOK HOLD OF THE DOOR HANDLE AND SLAMMED THE DOOR
GREGOR'S FATHER STAGGERED BACK TO HIS SEAT FEELING HIS WAY WITH HIS
HANDS AND FELL INTO IT IT LOOKED AS IF HE WAS STRETCHING HIMSELF
OUT FOR HIS USUAL EVENING NAP BUT FROM THE UNCONTROLLED WAY HIS HEAD
KEPT NODDING IT COULD BE SEEN THAT HE WAS NOT SLEEPING AT ALL
THROUGHOUT ALL THIS GREGOR HAD LAIN STILL WHERE THE THREE GENTLEMEN
HAD FIRST SEEN HIM
HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE FAILURE OF HIS PLAN
AND PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE HE WAS WEAK FROM HUNGER MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR HIM TO MOVE
HE WAS SURE THAT EVERYONE WOULD TURN ON HIM ANY
MOMENT AND HE WAITED
HE WAS NOT EVEN STARTLED OUT OF THIS STATE
WHEN THE VIOLIN ON HIS MOTHER'S LAP FELL FROM HER TREMBLING FINGERS
AND LANDED LOUDLY ON THE FLOOR
FATHER MOTHER SAID HIS SISTER HITTING THE TABLE WITH HER HAND
AS INTRODUCTION WE CAN'T CARRY ON LIKE THIS
MAYBE YOU CAN'T SEE
IT BUT I CAN
I DON'T WANT TO CALL THIS MONSTER MY BROTHER ALL I
CAN SAY IS WE HAVE TO TRY AND GET RID OF IT
WE'VE DONE ALL THAT'S
HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO LOOK AFTER IT AND BE PATIENT I DON'T THINK
ANYONE COULD ACCUSE US OF DOING ANYTHING WRONG
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SAID GREGOR'S FATHER TO HIMSELF
HIS
MOTHER WHO STILL HAD NOT HAD TIME TO CATCH HER BREATH BEGAN TO
COUGH DULLY HER HAND HELD OUT IN FRONT OF HER AND A DERANGED
EXPRESSION IN HER EYES
GREGOR'S SISTER RUSHED TO HIS MOTHER AND PUT HER HAND ON HER
FOREHEAD
HER WORDS SEEMED TO GIVE GREGOR'S FATHER SOME MORE
DEFINITE IDEAS
HE SAT UPRIGHT PLAYED WITH HIS UNIFORM CAP BETWEEN
THE PLATES LEFT BY THE THREE GENTLEMEN AFTER THEIR MEAL AND
OCCASIONALLY LOOKED DOWN AT GREGOR AS HE LAY THERE IMMOBILE
WE HAVE TO TRY AND GET RID OF IT SAID GREGOR'S SISTER NOW
SPEAKING ONLY TO HER FATHER AS HER MOTHER WAS TOO OCCUPIED WITH
COUGHING TO LISTEN IT'LL BE THE DEATH OF BOTH OF YOU I CAN SEE IT
COMING
WE CAN'T ALL WORK AS HARD AS WE HAVE TO AND THEN COME HOME
TO BE TORTURED LIKE THIS WE CAN'T ENDURE IT
I CAN'T ENDURE IT ANY
MORE AND SHE BROKE OUT SO HEAVILY IN TEARS THAT THEY FLOWED DOWN
THE FACE OF HER MOTHER AND SHE WIPED THEM AWAY WITH MECHANICAL HAND
MOVEMENTS
MY CHILD SAID HER FATHER WITH SYMPATHY AND OBVIOUS UNDERSTANDING
WHAT ARE WE TO DO
HIS SISTER JUST SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AS A SIGN OF THE HELPLESSNESS
AND TEARS THAT HAD TAKEN HOLD OF HER DISPLACING HER EARLIER
CERTAINTY
IF HE COULD JUST UNDERSTAND US SAID HIS FATHER ALMOST AS A
QUESTION HIS SISTER SHOOK HER HAND VIGOROUSLY THROUGH HER TEARS AS
A SIGN THAT OF THAT THERE WAS NO QUESTION
IF HE COULD JUST UNDERSTAND US REPEATED GREGOR'S FATHER CLOSING
HIS EYES IN ACCEPTANCE OF HIS SISTER'S CERTAINTY THAT THAT WAS QUITE
IMPOSSIBLE THEN PERHAPS WE COULD COME TO SOME KIND OF ARRANGEMENT
WITH HIM
BUT AS IT IS
IT'S GOT TO GO SHOUTED HIS SISTER THAT'S THE ONLY WAY FATHER
YOU'VE GOT TO GET RID OF THE IDEA THAT THAT'S GREGOR
WE'VE ONLY
HARMED OURSELVES BY BELIEVING IT FOR SO LONG
HOW CAN THAT BE
GREGOR IF IT WERE GREGOR HE WOULD HAVE SEEN LONG AGO THAT IT'S NOT
POSSIBLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO LIVE WITH AN ANIMAL LIKE THAT AND HE
WOULD HAVE GONE OF HIS OWN FREE WILL
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A BROTHER
ANY MORE THEN BUT WE COULD CARRY ON WITH OUR LIVES AND REMEMBER
HIM WITH RESPECT
AS IT IS THIS ANIMAL IS PERSECUTING US IT'S
DRIVEN OUT OUR TENANTS IT OBVIOUSLY WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WHOLE
FLAT AND FORCE US TO SLEEP ON THE STREETS
FATHER LOOK JUST
LOOK SHE SUDDENLY SCREAMED HE'S STARTING AGAIN IN HER ALARM
WHICH WAS TOTALLY BEYOND GREGOR'S COMPREHENSION HIS SISTER EVEN
ABANDONED HIS MOTHER AS SHE PUSHED HERSELF VIGOROUSLY OUT OF HER
CHAIR AS IF MORE WILLING TO SACRIFICE HER OWN MOTHER THAN STAY
ANYWHERE NEAR GREGOR
SHE RUSHED OVER TO BEHIND HER FATHER WHO HAD
BECOME EXCITED MERELY BECAUSE SHE WAS AND STOOD UP HALF RAISING HIS
HANDS IN FRONT OF GREGOR'S SISTER AS IF TO PROTECT HER
BUT GREGOR HAD HAD NO INTENTION OF FRIGHTENING ANYONE LEAST OF ALL
HIS SISTER
ALL HE HAD DONE WAS BEGIN TO TURN ROUND SO THAT HE
COULD GO BACK INTO HIS ROOM ALTHOUGH THAT WAS IN ITSELF QUITE
STARTLING AS HIS PAIN WRACKED CONDITION MEANT THAT TURNING ROUND
REQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT AND HE WAS USING HIS HEAD TO HELP
HIMSELF DO IT REPEATEDLY RAISING IT AND STRIKING IT AGAINST THE
FLOOR
HE STOPPED AND LOOKED ROUND
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE REALISED
HIS GOOD INTENTION AND HAD ONLY BEEN ALARMED BRIEFLY
NOW THEY ALL
LOOKED AT HIM IN UNHAPPY SILENCE
HIS MOTHER LAY IN HER CHAIR WITH
HER LEGS STRETCHED OUT AND PRESSED AGAINST EACH OTHER HER EYES
NEARLY CLOSED WITH EXHAUSTION HIS SISTER SAT NEXT TO HIS FATHER
WITH HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK
MAYBE NOW THEY'LL LET ME TURN ROUND THOUGHT GREGOR AND WENT BACK
TO WORK
HE COULD NOT HELP PANTING LOUDLY WITH THE EFFORT AND HAD
SOMETIMES TO STOP AND TAKE A REST
NO ONE WAS MAKING HIM RUSH ANY
MORE EVERYTHING WAS LEFT UP TO HIM
AS SOON AS HE HAD FINALLY
FINISHED TURNING ROUND HE BEGAN TO MOVE STRAIGHT AHEAD
HE WAS
AMAZED AT THE GREAT DISTANCE THAT SEPARATED HIM FROM HIS ROOM AND
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HE HAD COVERED THAT DISTANCE IN HIS WEAK
STATE A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE AND ALMOST WITHOUT NOTICING IT
HE
CONCENTRATED ON CRAWLING AS FAST AS HE COULD AND HARDLY NOTICED THAT
THERE WAS NOT A WORD NOT ANY CRY FROM HIS FAMILY TO DISTRACT HIM
HE DID NOT TURN HIS HEAD UNTIL HE HAD REACHED THE DOORWAY
HE DID
NOT TURN IT ALL THE WAY ROUND AS HE FELT HIS NECK BECOMING STIFF
BUT IT WAS NONETHELESS ENOUGH TO SEE THAT NOTHING BEHIND HIM HAD
CHANGED ONLY HIS SISTER HAD STOOD UP
WITH HIS LAST GLANCE HE SAW
THAT HIS MOTHER HAD NOW FALLEN COMPLETELY ASLEEP
HE WAS HARDLY INSIDE HIS ROOM BEFORE THE DOOR WAS HURRIEDLY SHUT
BOLTED AND LOCKED
THE SUDDEN NOISE BEHIND GREGOR SO STARTLED HIM
THAT HIS LITTLE LEGS COLLAPSED UNDER HIM
IT WAS HIS SISTER WHO HAD
BEEN IN SO MUCH OF A RUSH
SHE HAD BEEN STANDING THERE WAITING AND
SPRUNG FORWARD LIGHTLY GREGOR HAD NOT HEARD HER COMING AT ALL AND
AS SHE TURNED THE KEY IN THE LOCK SHE SAID LOUDLY TO HER PARENTS AT
LAST
WHAT NOW THEN GREGOR ASKED HIMSELF AS HE LOOKED ROUND IN THE
DARKNESS
HE SOON MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT HE COULD NO LONGER MOVE
AT ALL
THIS WAS NO SURPRISE TO HIM IT SEEMED RATHER THAT BEING
ABLE TO ACTUALLY MOVE AROUND ON THOSE SPINDLY LITTLE LEGS UNTIL THEN
WAS UNNATURAL
HE ALSO FELT RELATIVELY COMFORTABLE
IT IS TRUE
THAT HIS ENTIRE BODY WAS ACHING BUT THE PAIN SEEMED TO BE SLOWLY
GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER AND WOULD FINALLY DISAPPEAR ALTOGETHER
HE COULD ALREADY HARDLY FEEL THE DECAYED APPLE IN HIS BACK OR THE
INFLAMED AREA AROUND IT WHICH WAS ENTIRELY COVERED IN WHITE DUST
HE THOUGHT BACK OF HIS FAMILY WITH EMOTION AND LOVE
IF IT WAS
POSSIBLE HE FELT THAT HE MUST GO AWAY EVEN MORE STRONGLY THAN HIS
SISTER
HE REMAINED IN THIS STATE OF EMPTY AND PEACEFUL RUMINATION
UNTIL HE HEARD THE CLOCK TOWER STRIKE THREE IN THE MORNING
HE
WATCHED AS IT SLOWLY BEGAN TO GET LIGHT EVERYWHERE OUTSIDE THE
WINDOW TOO
THEN WITHOUT HIS WILLING IT HIS HEAD SANK DOWN
COMPLETELY AND HIS LAST BREATH FLOWED WEAKLY FROM HIS NOSTRILS
WHEN THE CLEANER CAME IN EARLY IN THE MORNING THEY'D OFTEN ASKED
HER NOT TO KEEP SLAMMING THE DOORS BUT WITH HER STRENGTH AND IN HER
HURRY SHE STILL DID SO THAT EVERYONE IN THE FLAT KNEW WHEN SHE'D
ARRIVED AND FROM THEN ON IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP IN PEACE SHE
MADE HER USUAL BRIEF LOOK IN ON GREGOR AND AT FIRST FOUND NOTHING
SPECIAL
SHE THOUGHT HE WAS LAYING THERE SO STILL ON PURPOSE
PLAYING THE MARTYR SHE ATTRIBUTED ALL POSSIBLE UNDERSTANDING TO
HIM
SHE HAPPENED TO BE HOLDING THE LONG BROOM IN HER HAND SO SHE
TRIED TO TICKLE GREGOR WITH IT FROM THE DOORWAY
WHEN SHE HAD NO
SUCCESS WITH THAT SHE TRIED TO MAKE A NUISANCE OF HERSELF AND POKED
AT HIM A LITTLE AND ONLY WHEN SHE FOUND SHE COULD SHOVE HIM ACROSS
THE FLOOR WITH NO RESISTANCE AT ALL DID SHE START TO PAY ATTENTION
SHE SOON REALISED WHAT HAD REALLY HAPPENED OPENED HER EYES WIDE
WHISTLED TO HERSELF BUT DID NOT WASTE TIME TO YANK OPEN THE BEDROOM
DOORS AND SHOUT LOUDLY INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE BEDROOMS COME AND
'AVE A LOOK AT THIS IT'S DEAD JUST LYING THERE STONE DEAD
MR
AND MRS
SAMSA SAT UPRIGHT THERE IN THEIR MARRIAGE BED AND HAD
TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET OVER THE SHOCK CAUSED BY THE CLEANER BEFORE
THEY COULD GRASP WHAT SHE WAS SAYING
BUT THEN EACH FROM HIS OWN
SIDE THEY HURRIED OUT OF BED
MR
SAMSA THREW THE BLANKET OVER HIS
SHOULDERS MRS
SAMSA JUST CAME OUT IN HER NIGHTDRESS AND THAT IS
HOW THEY WENT INTO GREGOR'S ROOM
ON THE WAY THEY OPENED THE DOOR
TO THE LIVING ROOM WHERE GRETE HAD BEEN SLEEPING SINCE THE THREE
GENTLEMEN HAD MOVED IN SHE WAS FULLY DRESSED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER
BEEN ASLEEP AND THE PALENESS OF HER FACE SEEMED TO CONFIRM THIS
DEAD ASKED MRS
SAMSA LOOKING AT THE CHARWOMAN ENQUIRINGLY
EVEN THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE CHECKED FOR HERSELF AND COULD HAVE KNOWN
IT EVEN WITHOUT CHECKING
THAT'S WHAT I SAID REPLIED THE
CLEANER AND TO PROVE IT SHE GAVE GREGOR'S BODY ANOTHER SHOVE WITH
THE BROOM SENDING IT SIDEWAYS ACROSS THE FLOOR
MRS
SAMSA MADE A
MOVEMENT AS IF SHE WANTED TO HOLD BACK THE BROOM BUT DID NOT
COMPLETE IT
NOW THEN SAID MR
SAMSA LET'S GIVE THANKS TO GOD
FOR THAT
HE CROSSED HIMSELF AND THE THREE WOMEN FOLLOWED HIS
EXAMPLE
GRETE WHO HAD NOT TAKEN HER EYES FROM THE CORPSE SAID
JUST LOOK HOW THIN HE WAS
HE DIDN'T EAT ANYTHING FOR SO LONG
THE FOOD CAME OUT AGAIN JUST THE SAME AS WHEN IT WENT IN
GREGOR'S
BODY WAS INDEED COMPLETELY DRIED UP AND FLAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN IT
UNTIL THEN BUT NOW HE WAS NOT LIFTED UP ON HIS LITTLE LEGS NOR DID
HE DO ANYTHING TO MAKE THEM LOOK AWAY
GRETE COME WITH US IN HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE SAID MRS
SAMSA
WITH A PAINED SMILE AND GRETE FOLLOWED HER PARENTS INTO THE BEDROOM
BUT NOT WITHOUT LOOKING BACK AT THE BODY
THE CLEANER SHUT THE DOOR
AND OPENED THE WINDOW WIDE
ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL EARLY IN THE
MORNING THE FRESH AIR HAD SOMETHING OF WARMTH MIXED IN WITH IT
IT
WAS ALREADY THE END OF MARCH AFTER ALL
THE THREE GENTLEMEN STEPPED OUT OF THEIR ROOM AND LOOKED ROUND IN
AMAZEMENT FOR THEIR BREAKFASTS THEY HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN ABOUT
WHERE IS OUR BREAKFAST THE MIDDLE GENTLEMAN ASKED THE CLEANER
IRRITABLY
SHE JUST PUT HER FINGER ON HER LIPS AND MADE A QUICK AND
SILENT SIGN TO THE MEN THAT THEY MIGHT LIKE TO COME INTO GREGOR'S
ROOM
THEY DID SO AND STOOD AROUND GREGOR'S CORPSE WITH THEIR
HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF THEIR WELL WORN COATS
IT WAS NOW QUITE
LIGHT IN THE ROOM
THEN THE DOOR OF THE BEDROOM OPENED AND MR
SAMSA APPEARED IN HIS
UNIFORM WITH HIS WIFE ON ONE ARM AND HIS DAUGHTER ON THE OTHER
ALL
OF THEM HAD BEEN CRYING A LITTLE GRETE NOW AND THEN PRESSED HER
FACE AGAINST HER FATHER'S ARM
LEAVE MY HOME
NOW SAID MR
SAMSA INDICATING THE DOOR AND
WITHOUT LETTING THE WOMEN FROM HIM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED THE
MIDDLE OF THE THREE GENTLEMEN SOMEWHAT DISCONCERTED AND HE SMILED
SWEETLY
THE OTHER TWO HELD THEIR HANDS BEHIND THEIR BACKS AND
CONTINUALLY RUBBED THEM TOGETHER IN GLEEFUL ANTICIPATION OF A LOUD
QUARREL WHICH COULD ONLY END IN THEIR FAVOUR
I MEAN JUST WHAT I
SAID ANSWERED MR
SAMSA AND WITH HIS TWO COMPANIONS WENT IN A
STRAIGHT LINE TOWARDS THE MAN
AT FIRST HE STOOD THERE STILL
LOOKING AT THE GROUND AS IF THE CONTENTS OF HIS HEAD WERE
REARRANGING THEMSELVES INTO NEW POSITIONS
ALRIGHT WE'LL GO
THEN HE SAID AND LOOKED UP AT MR
SAMSA AS IF HE HAD BEEN
SUDDENLY OVERCOME WITH HUMILITY AND WANTED PERMISSION AGAIN FROM
MR
SAMSA FOR HIS DECISION
MR
SAMSA MERELY OPENED HIS EYES WIDE
AND BRIEFLY NODDED TO HIM SEVERAL TIMES
AT THAT AND WITHOUT
DELAY THE MAN ACTUALLY DID TAKE LONG STRIDES INTO THE FRONT
HALLWAY HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD STOPPED RUBBING THEIR HANDS SOME TIME
BEFORE AND HAD BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID
NOW THEY
JUMPED OFF AFTER THEIR FRIEND AS IF TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FEAR THAT
MR
SAMSA MIGHT GO INTO THE HALLWAY IN FRONT OF THEM AND BREAK THE
CONNECTION WITH THEIR LEADER
ONCE THERE ALL THREE TOOK THEIR HATS
FROM THE STAND TOOK THEIR STICKS FROM THE HOLDER BOWED WITHOUT A
WORD AND LEFT THE PREMISES
MR
SAMSA AND THE TWO WOMEN FOLLOWED
THEM OUT ONTO THE LANDING BUT THEY HAD HAD NO REASON TO MISTRUST
THE MEN'S INTENTIONS AND AS THEY LEANED OVER THE LANDING THEY SAW HOW
THE THREE GENTLEMEN MADE SLOW BUT STEADY PROGRESS DOWN THE MANY
STEPS
AS THEY TURNED THE CORNER ON EACH FLOOR THEY DISAPPEARED AND
WOULD REAPPEAR A FEW MOMENTS LATER THE FURTHER DOWN THEY WENT THE
MORE THAT THE SAMSA FAMILY LOST INTEREST IN THEM WHEN A BUTCHER'S
BOY PROUD OF POSTURE WITH HIS TRAY ON HIS HEAD PASSED THEM ON HIS
WAY UP AND CAME NEARER THAN THEY WERE MR
SAMSA AND THE WOMEN CAME
AWAY FROM THE LANDING AND WENT AS IF RELIEVED BACK INTO THE FLAT
THEY DECIDED THE BEST WAY TO MAKE USE OF THAT DAY WAS FOR RELAXATION
AND TO GO FOR A WALK NOT ONLY HAD THEY EARNED A BREAK FROM WORK BUT
THEY WERE IN SERIOUS NEED OF IT
SO THEY SAT AT THE TABLE AND WROTE
THREE LETTERS OF EXCUSAL MR
SAMSA TO HIS EMPLOYERS MRS
SAMSA
TO HER CONTRACTOR AND GRETE TO HER PRINCIPAL
THE CLEANER CAME IN
WHILE THEY WERE WRITING TO TELL THEM SHE WAS GOING SHE'D FINISHED
HER WORK FOR THAT MORNING
THE THREE OF THEM AT FIRST JUST NODDED
WITHOUT LOOKING UP FROM WHAT THEY WERE WRITING AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN
THE CLEANER STILL DID NOT SEEM TO WANT TO LEAVE THAT THEY LOOKED UP
IN IRRITATION
WELL ASKED MR
SAMSA
THE CHARWOMAN STOOD IN
THE DOORWAY WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE AS IF SHE HAD SOME TREMENDOUS
GOOD NEWS TO REPORT BUT WOULD ONLY DO IT IF SHE WAS CLEARLY ASKED
TO
THE ALMOST VERTICAL LITTLE OSTRICH FEATHER ON HER HAT WHICH
HAD BEEN A SOURCE OF IRRITATION TO MR
SAMSA ALL THE TIME SHE HAD
BEEN WORKING FOR THEM SWAYED GENTLY IN ALL DIRECTIONS
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT THEN ASKED MRS
SAMSA WHOM THE CLEANER HAD THE MOST
RESPECT FOR
YES SHE ANSWERED AND BROKE INTO A FRIENDLY LAUGH
THAT MADE HER UNABLE TO SPEAK STRAIGHT AWAY WELL THEN THAT THING
IN THERE YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET RID OF IT
THAT'S ALL BEEN SORTED OUT MRS
SAMSA AND GRETE BENT DOWN OVER
THEIR LETTERS AS IF INTENT ON CONTINUING WITH WHAT THEY WERE
WRITING MR
SAMSA SAW THAT THE CLEANER WANTED TO START DESCRIBING
EVERYTHING IN DETAIL BUT WITH OUTSTRETCHED HAND HE MADE IT QUITE
CLEAR THAT SHE WAS NOT TO
SO AS SHE WAS PREVENTED FROM TELLING
THEM ALL ABOUT IT SHE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED WHAT A HURRY SHE WAS IN
AND CLEARLY PEEVED CALLED OUT CHEERIO THEN EVERYONE TURNED
ROUND SHARPLY AND LEFT SLAMMING THE DOOR TERRIBLY AS SHE WENT
TONIGHT SHE GETS SACKED SAID MR
SAMSA BUT HE RECEIVED NO REPLY
FROM EITHER HIS WIFE OR HIS DAUGHTER AS THE CHARWOMAN SEEMED TO HAVE
DESTROYED THE PEACE THEY HAD ONLY JUST GAINED
THEY GOT UP AND WENT
OVER TO THE WINDOW WHERE THEY REMAINED WITH THEIR ARMS AROUND EACH
OTHER
MR
SAMSA TWISTED ROUND IN HIS CHAIR TO LOOK AT THEM AND SAT
THERE WATCHING FOR A WHILE
THEN HE CALLED OUT COME HERE THEN
LET'S FORGET ABOUT ALL THAT OLD STUFF SHALL WE
COME AND GIVE ME A
BIT OF ATTENTION
THE TWO WOMEN IMMEDIATELY DID AS HE SAID
HURRYING OVER TO HIM WHERE THEY KISSED HIM AND HUGGED HIM AND THEN
THEY QUICKLY FINISHED THEIR LETTERS
AFTER THAT THE THREE OF THEM LEFT THE FLAT TOGETHER WHICH WAS
SOMETHING THEY HAD NOT DONE FOR MONTHS AND TOOK THE TRAM OUT TO THE
OPEN COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE TOWN
THEY HAD THE TRAM FILLED WITH WARM
SUNSHINE ALL TO THEMSELVES
LEANT BACK COMFORTABLY ON THEIR SEATS
THEY DISCUSSED THEIR PROSPECTS AND FOUND THAT ON CLOSER EXAMINATION
THEY WERE NOT AT ALL BAD UNTIL THEN THEY HAD NEVER ASKED EACH
OTHER ABOUT THEIR WORK BUT ALL THREE HAD JOBS WHICH WERE VERY GOOD
AND HELD PARTICULARLY GOOD PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE
THE GREATEST
IMPROVEMENT FOR THE TIME BEING OF COURSE WOULD BE ACHIEVED QUITE
EASILY BY MOVING HOUSE WHAT THEY NEEDED NOW WAS A FLAT THAT WAS
SMALLER AND CHEAPER THAN THE CURRENT ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CHOSEN BY
GREGOR ONE THAT WAS IN A BETTER LOCATION AND MOST OF ALL MORE
PRACTICAL
ALL THE TIME GRETE WAS BECOMING LIVELIER
WITH ALL THE
WORRY THEY HAD BEEN HAVING OF LATE HER CHEEKS HAD BECOME PALE BUT
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING MR
AND MRS
SAMSA WERE STRUCK ALMOST
SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE THOUGHT OF HOW THEIR DAUGHTER WAS
BLOSSOMING INTO A WELL BUILT AND BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY
THEY BECAME
QUIETER
JUST FROM EACH OTHER'S GLANCE AND ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING
IT THEY AGREED THAT IT WOULD SOON BE TIME TO FIND A GOOD MAN FOR
HER
AND AS IF IN CONFIRMATION OF THEIR NEW DREAMS AND GOOD
INTENTIONS AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THEIR DESTINATION GRETE WAS THE
FIRST TO GET UP AND STRETCH OUT HER YOUNG BODY

CHAPTER ONE
ARREST CONVERSATION WITH MRS
GRUBACH THEN MISS BRSTNER
SOMEONE MUST HAVE BEEN TELLING LIES ABOUT JOSEF K HE KNEW HE HAD
DONE NOTHING WRONG BUT ONE MORNING HE WAS ARRESTED
EVERY DAY AT
EIGHT IN THE MORNING HE WAS BROUGHT HIS BREAKFAST BY MRS
GRUBACH'S
COOK MRS
GRUBACH WAS HIS LANDLADY BUT TODAY SHE DIDN'T COME
THAT
HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE
K
WAITED A LITTLE WHILE LOOKED FROM HIS
PILLOW AT THE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED OPPOSITE AND WHO WAS WATCHING HIM WITH
AN INQUISITIVENESS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR HER AND FINALLY BOTH HUNGRY AND
DISCONCERTED RANG THE BELL
THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
AND A MAN ENTERED
HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE MAN IN THIS HOUSE BEFORE
HE
WAS SLIM BUT FIRMLY BUILT HIS CLOTHES WERE BLACK AND CLOSE FITTING
WITH MANY FOLDS AND POCKETS BUCKLES AND BUTTONS AND A BELT ALL OF
WHICH GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING VERY PRACTICAL BUT WITHOUT MAKING IT
VERY CLEAR WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY FOR
WHO ARE YOU ASKED K
SITTING HALF UPRIGHT IN HIS BED
THE MAN HOWEVER IGNORED THE QUESTION
AS IF HIS ARRIVAL SIMPLY HAD TO BE ACCEPTED AND MERELY REPLIED YOU
RANG ANNA SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME MY BREAKFAST SAID K
HE TRIED TO
WORK OUT WHO THE MAN ACTUALLY WAS FIRST IN SILENCE JUST THROUGH
OBSERVATION AND BY THINKING ABOUT IT BUT THE MAN DIDN'T STAY STILL TO
BE LOOKED AT FOR VERY LONG
INSTEAD HE WENT OVER TO THE DOOR OPENED IT
SLIGHTLY AND SAID TO SOMEONE WHO WAS CLEARLY STANDING IMMEDIATELY
BEHIND IT HE WANTS ANNA TO BRING HIM HIS BREAKFAST THERE WAS A
LITTLE LAUGHTER IN THE NEIGHBOURING ROOM IT WAS NOT CLEAR FROM THE
SOUND OF IT WHETHER THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE LAUGHING
THE STRANGE MAN
COULD NOT HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM IT THAT HE HADN'T KNOWN ALREADY
BUT NOW HE SAID TO K AS IF MAKING HIS REPORT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE
IT WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME THAT'S HAPPENED SAID K AS HE JUMPED OUT
OF BED AND QUICKLY PULLED ON HIS TROUSERS
I WANT TO SEE WHO THAT IS
IN THE NEXT ROOM AND WHY IT IS THAT MRS
GRUBACH HAS LET ME BE
DISTURBED IN THIS WAY IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE NEEDN'T
HAVE SAID THIS OUT LOUD AND THAT HE MUST TO SOME EXTENT HAVE
ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR AUTHORITY BY DOING SO BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM IMPORTANT
TO HIM AT THE TIME
THAT AT LEAST IS HOW THE STRANGER TOOK IT AS HE
SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'D BETTER STAY WHERE YOU ARE I WANT
NEITHER TO STAY HERE NOR TO BE SPOKEN TO BY YOU UNTIL YOU'VE INTRODUCED
YOURSELF I MEANT IT FOR YOUR OWN GOOD SAID THE STRANGER AND OPENED
THE DOOR THIS TIME WITHOUT BEING ASKED
THE NEXT ROOM WHICH K
ENTERED MORE SLOWLY THAN HE HAD INTENDED LOOKED AT FIRST GLANCE EXACTLY
THE SAME AS IT HAD THE PREVIOUS EVENING
IT WAS MRS
GRUBACH'S LIVING
ROOM OVER FILLED WITH FURNITURE TABLECLOTHS PORCELAIN AND
PHOTOGRAPHS
PERHAPS THERE WAS A LITTLE MORE SPACE IN THERE THAN USUAL
TODAY BUT IF SO IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS ESPECIALLY AS THE MAIN
DIFFERENCE WAS THE PRESENCE OF A MAN SITTING BY THE OPEN WINDOW WITH A
BOOK FROM WHICH HE NOW LOOKED UP
YOU SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN YOUR ROOM
DIDN'T FRANZ TELL YOU AND WHAT IS IT YOU WANT THEN SAID K
LOOKING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE AND THE ONE NAMED
FRANZ WHO HAD REMAINED IN THE DOORWAY
THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW HE
NOTICED THE OLD WOMAN AGAIN WHO HAD COME CLOSE TO THE WINDOW OPPOSITE
SO THAT SHE COULD CONTINUE TO SEE EVERYTHING
SHE WAS SHOWING AN
INQUISITIVENESS THAT REALLY MADE IT SEEM LIKE SHE WAS GOING SENILE
I
WANT TO SEE MRS
GRUBACH SAID K MAKING A MOVEMENT AS IF TEARING
HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE TWO MEN EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE STANDING WELL AWAY
FROM HIM AND WANTED TO GO
NO SAID THE MAN AT THE WINDOW WHO
THREW HIS BOOK DOWN ON A COFFEE TABLE AND STOOD UP
YOU CAN'T GO AWAY
WHEN YOU'RE UNDER ARREST THAT'S HOW IT SEEMS SAID K
AND WHY AM
I UNDER ARREST HE THEN ASKED
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
TELL YOU
GO INTO YOUR ROOM AND WAIT THERE
PROCEEDINGS ARE UNDERWAY
AND YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT EVERYTHING ALL IN GOOD TIME
IT'S NOT REALLY
PART OF MY JOB TO BE FRIENDLY TOWARDS YOU LIKE THIS BUT I HOPE NO ONE
APART FROM FRANZ WILL HEAR ABOUT IT AND HE'S BEEN MORE FRIENDLY
TOWARDS YOU THAN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE RULES HIMSELF
IF YOU
CARRY ON HAVING AS MUCH GOOD LUCK AS YOU HAVE BEEN WITH YOUR ARRESTING
OFFICERS THEN YOU CAN RECKON ON THINGS GOING WELL WITH YOU K
WANTED
TO SIT DOWN BUT THEN HE SAW THAT APART FROM THE CHAIR BY THE WINDOW
THERE WAS NOWHERE ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM WHERE HE COULD SIT
YOU'LL GET
THE CHANCE TO SEE FOR YOURSELF HOW TRUE ALL THIS IS SAID FRANZ AND
BOTH MEN THEN WALKED UP TO K
THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BIGGER THAN HIM
ESPECIALLY THE SECOND MAN WHO FREQUENTLY SLAPPED HIM ON THE SHOULDER
THE TWO OF THEM FELT K 'S NIGHTSHIRT AND SAID HE WOULD NOW HAVE TO WEAR
ONE THAT WAS OF MUCH LOWER QUALITY BUT THAT THEY WOULD KEEP THE
NIGHTSHIRT ALONG WITH HIS OTHER UNDERCLOTHES AND RETURN THEM TO HIM IF
HIS CASE TURNED OUT WELL
IT'S BETTER FOR YOU IF YOU GIVE US THE
THINGS THAN IF YOU LEAVE THEM IN THE STOREROOM THEY SAID
THINGS
HAVE A TENDENCY TO GO MISSING IN THE STOREROOM AND AFTER A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF TIME THEY SELL THINGS OFF WHETHER THE CASE INVOLVED HAS COME
TO AN END OR NOT
AND CASES LIKE THIS CAN LAST A LONG TIME ESPECIALLY
THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN COMING UP LATELY
THEY'D GIVE YOU THE MONEY
THEY GOT FOR THEM BUT IT WOULDN'T BE VERY MUCH AS IT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE
OFFERED FOR THEM WHEN THEY SELL THEM THAT COUNTS IT'S HOW MUCH THEY GET
SLIPPED ON THE SIDE AND THINGS LIKE THAT LOSE THEIR VALUE ANYWAY WHEN
THEY GET PASSED ON FROM HAND TO HAND YEAR AFTER YEAR K
PAID HARDLY
ANY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING HE DID NOT PLACE MUCH VALUE ON
WHAT HE MAY HAVE STILL POSSESSED OR ON WHO DECIDED WHAT HAPPENED TO
THEM
IT WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM TO GET A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF
HIS POSITION BUT HE COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY WHILE THESE PEOPLE WERE
HERE THE SECOND POLICEMAN'S BELLY AND THEY COULD ONLY BE POLICEMEN
LOOKED FRIENDLY ENOUGH STICKING OUT TOWARDS HIM BUT WHEN K
LOOKED UP
AND SAW HIS DRY BONEY FACE IT DID NOT SEEM TO FIT WITH THE BODY
HIS
STRONG NOSE TWISTED TO ONE SIDE AS IF IGNORING K
AND SHARING AN
UNDERSTANDING WITH THE OTHER POLICEMAN
WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE WERE THESE
WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT WHAT OFFICE DID THEY BELONG TO K
WAS
LIVING IN A FREE COUNTRY AFTER ALL EVERYWHERE WAS AT PEACE ALL LAWS
WERE DECENT AND WERE UPHELD WHO WAS IT WHO DARED ACCOST HIM IN HIS OWN
HOME HE WAS ALWAYS INCLINED TO TAKE LIFE AS LIGHTLY AS HE COULD TO
CROSS BRIDGES WHEN HE CAME TO THEM PAY NO HEED FOR THE FUTURE EVEN
WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMED UNDER THREAT
BUT HERE THAT DID NOT SEEM THE
RIGHT THING TO DO
HE COULD HAVE TAKEN IT ALL AS A JOKE A BIG JOKE SET
UP BY HIS COLLEAGUES AT THE BANK FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON OR ALSO
PERHAPS BECAUSE TODAY WAS HIS THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY IT WAS ALL POSSIBLE OF
COURSE MAYBE ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS LAUGH IN THE POLICEMEN'S FACE IN SOME
WAY AND THEY WOULD LAUGH WITH HIM MAYBE THEY WERE TRADESMEN FROM THE
CORNER OF THE STREET THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY MIGHT BE BUT HE WAS
NONETHELESS DETERMINED EVER SINCE HE FIRST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE ONE
CALLED FRANZ NOT TO LOSE ANY SLIGHT ADVANTAGE HE MIGHT HAVE HAD OVER
THESE PEOPLE
THERE WAS A VERY SLIGHT RISK THAT PEOPLE WOULD LATER SAY
HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A JOKE BUT ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T NORMALLY IN THE
HABIT OF LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE HE MIGHT ALSO HAVE HAD A FEW
UNIMPORTANT OCCASIONS IN MIND WHEN UNLIKE HIS MORE CAUTIOUS FRIENDS HE
HAD ACTED WITH NO THOUGHT AT ALL FOR WHAT MIGHT FOLLOW AND HAD BEEN MADE
TO SUFFER FOR IT
HE DIDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN NOT THIS TIME AT
LEAST IF THEY WERE PLAY ACTING HE WOULD ACT ALONG WITH THEM
HE STILL HAD TIME
ALLOW ME HE SAID AND HURRIED BETWEEN THE
TWO POLICEMEN THROUGH INTO HIS ROOM
HE SEEMS SENSIBLE ENOUGH HE
HEARD THEM SAY BEHIND HIM
ONCE IN HIS ROOM HE QUICKLY PULLED OPEN THE
DRAWER OF HIS WRITING DESK EVERYTHING IN IT WAS VERY TIDY BUT IN HIS
AGITATION HE WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS HE WAS
LOOKING FOR STRAIGHT AWAY
HE FINALLY FOUND HIS BICYCLE PERMIT AND WAS
ABOUT TO GO BACK TO THE POLICEMEN WITH IT WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM TOO
PETTY SO HE CARRIED ON SEARCHING UNTIL HE FOUND HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE
JUST AS HE GOT BACK IN THE ADJOINING ROOM THE DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE
OPENED AND MRS
GRUBACH WAS ABOUT TO ENTER
HE ONLY SAW HER FOR AN
INSTANT FOR AS SOON AS SHE RECOGNISED K
SHE WAS CLEARLY EMBARRASSED
ASKED FOR FORGIVENESS AND DISAPPEARED CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY
CAREFULLY
DO COME IN K
COULD HAVE SAID JUST THEN
BUT NOW HE STOOD
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WITH HIS PAPERS IN HIS HAND AND STILL LOOKING
AT THE DOOR WHICH DID NOT OPEN AGAIN
HE STAYED LIKE THAT UNTIL HE WAS
STARTLED OUT OF IT BY THE SHOUT OF THE POLICEMAN WHO SAT AT THE LITTLE
TABLE AT THE OPEN WINDOW AND AS K
NOW SAW WAS EATING HIS BREAKFAST
WHY DIDN'T SHE COME IN HE ASKED
SHE'S NOT ALLOWED TO SAID THE
BIG POLICEMAN
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST AREN'T YOU BUT HOW CAN I BE
UNDER ARREST AND HOW COME IT'S LIKE THIS NOW YOU'RE STARTING
AGAIN SAID THE POLICEMAN DIPPING A PIECE OF BUTTERED BREAD IN THE
HONEYPOT
WE DON'T ANSWER QUESTIONS LIKE THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO
ANSWER THEM SAID K
HERE ARE MY IDENTIFICATION PAPERS NOW SHOW ME
YOURS AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE THE ARREST WARRANT OH MY GOD
SAID THE POLICEMAN
IN A POSITION LIKE YOURS AND YOU THINK YOU CAN
START GIVING ORDERS DO YOU IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD TO GET US ON THE
WRONG SIDE EVEN IF YOU THINK IT WILL WE'RE PROBABLY MORE ON YOUR SIDE
THAT ANYONE ELSE YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE YOU KNOW YOU'D BETTER
BELIEVE IT SAID FRANZ HOLDING A CUP OF COFFEE IN HIS HAND WHICH HE
DID NOT LIFT TO HIS MOUTH BUT LOOKED AT K
IN A WAY THAT WAS PROBABLY
MEANT TO BE FULL OF MEANING BUT COULD NOT ACTUALLY BE UNDERSTOOD
K
FOUND HIMSELF WITHOUT INTENDING IT IN A MUTE DIALOGUE WITH FRANZ BUT
THEN SLAPPED HIS HAND DOWN ON HIS PAPERS AND SAID HERE ARE MY IDENTITY
DOCUMENTS AND WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO ABOUT IT REPLIED THE BIG
POLICEMAN LOUDLY
THE WAY YOU'RE CARRYING ON IT'S WORSE THAN A
CHILD
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT DO YOU WANT TO GET THIS GREAT BLOODY TRIAL
OF YOURS OVER WITH QUICKLY BY TALKING ABOUT ID AND ARREST WARRANTS WITH
US WE'RE JUST COPPERS THAT'S ALL WE ARE
JUNIOR OFFICERS LIKE US
HARDLY KNOW ONE END OF AN ID CARD FROM ANOTHER ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO WITH
YOU IS KEEP AN EYE ON YOU FOR TEN HOURS A DAY AND GET PAID FOR IT
THAT'S ALL WE ARE
MIND YOU WHAT WE CAN DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE HIGH
OFFICIALS WE WORK FOR FIND OUT JUST WHAT SORT OF PERSON IT IS THEY'RE
GOING TO ARREST AND WHY HE SHOULD BE ARRESTED BEFORE THEY ISSUE THE
WARRANT
THERE'S NO MISTAKE THERE
OUR AUTHORITIES AS FAR AS I KNOW
AND I ONLY KNOW THE LOWEST GRADES DON'T GO OUT LOOKING FOR GUILT AMONG
THE PUBLIC IT'S THE GUILT THAT DRAWS THEM OUT LIKE IT SAYS IN THE LAW
AND THEY HAVE TO SEND US POLICE OFFICERS OUT
THAT'S THE LAW
WHERE
D'YOU THINK THERE'D BE ANY MISTAKE THERE I DON'T KNOW THIS LAW
SAID K
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU THEN SAID THE POLICEMAN
IT'S
PROBABLY EXISTS ONLY IN YOUR HEADS SAID K HE WANTED IN SOME WAY TO
INSINUATE HIS WAY INTO THE THOUGHTS OF THE POLICEMEN TO RE SHAPE THOSE
THOUGHTS TO HIS BENEFIT OR TO MAKE HIMSELF AT HOME THERE
BUT THE
POLICEMAN JUST SAID DISMISSIVELY YOU'LL FIND OUT WHEN IT AFFECTS YOU
FRANZ JOINED IN AND SAID LOOK AT THIS WILLEM HE ADMITS HE DOESN'T
KNOW THE LAW AND AT THE SAME TIME INSISTS HE'S INNOCENT YOU'RE QUITE
RIGHT BUT WE CAN'T GET HIM TO UNDERSTAND A THING SAID THE OTHER
K
STOPPED TALKING WITH THEM DO I HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF DO I REALLY HAVE
TO CARRY ON GETTING TANGLED UP WITH THE CHATTERING OF BASE FUNCTIONARIES
LIKE THIS AND THEY ADMIT THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE OF THE LOWEST
POSITION
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THINGS OF WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE THE
SLIGHTEST UNDERSTANDING ANYWAY
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR STUPIDITY
THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BE SO SURE OF THEMSELVES
I JUST NEED FEW WORDS
WITH SOMEONE OF THE SAME SOCIAL STANDING AS MYSELF AND EVERYTHING WILL
BE INCOMPARABLY CLEARER MUCH CLEARER THAN A LONG CONVERSATION WITH
THESE TWO CAN MAKE IT
HE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE FREE SPACE IN THE ROOM
A COUPLE OF TIMES ACROSS THE STREET HE COULD SEE THE OLD WOMAN WHO
NOW HAD PULLED AN OLD MAN MUCH OLDER THAN HERSELF UP TO THE WINDOW
AND HAD HER ARMS AROUND HIM
K
HAD TO PUT AN END TO THIS DISPLAY
TAKE ME TO YOUR SUPERIOR HE SAID
AS SOON AS HE WANTS TO SEE YOU
NOT BEFORE SAID THE POLICEMAN THE ONE CALLED WILLEM
AND NOW MY
ADVICE TO YOU HE ADDED IS TO GO INTO YOUR ROOM STAY CALM AND WAIT
AND SEE WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH YOU
IF YOU TAKE OUR ADVICE YOU WON'T
TIRE YOURSELF OUT THINKING ABOUT THINGS TO NO PURPOSE YOU NEED TO PULL
YOURSELF TOGETHER AS THERE'S A LOT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRED OF YOU
YOU'VE NOT BEHAVED TOWARDS US THE WAY WE DESERVE AFTER BEING SO GOOD TO
YOU YOU FORGET THAT WE WHATEVER WE ARE WE'RE STILL FREE MEN AND
YOU'RE NOT AND THAT'S QUITE AN ADVANTAGE
BUT IN SPITE OF ALL THAT
WE'RE STILL WILLING IF YOU'VE GOT THE MONEY TO GO AND GET YOU SOME
BREAKFAST FROM THE CAF OVER THE ROAD
WITHOUT GIVING ANY ANSWER TO THIS OFFER K
STOOD STILL FOR SOME
TIME
PERHAPS IF HE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE NEXT ROOM OR EVEN THE FRONT
DOOR THE TWO OF THEM WOULD NOT DARE TO STAND IN HIS WAY PERHAPS THAT
WOULD BE THE SIMPLEST WAY TO SETTLE THE WHOLE THING BY BRINGING IT TO A
HEAD
BUT MAYBE THEY WOULD GRAB HIM AND IF HE WERE THROWN DOWN ON THE
GROUND HE WOULD LOSE ALL THE ADVANTAGE HE IN A CERTAIN RESPECT HAD
OVER THEM
SO HE DECIDED ON THE MORE CERTAIN SOLUTION THE WAY THINGS
WOULD GO IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF EVENTS AND WENT BACK IN HIS ROOM
WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD EITHER FROM HIM OR FROM THE POLICEMEN
HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND FROM THE DRESSING TABLE HE
TOOK THE NICE APPLE THAT HE HAD PUT THERE THE PREVIOUS EVENING FOR HIS
BREAKFAST
NOW IT WAS ALL THE BREAKFAST HE HAD AND ANYWAY AS HE
CONFIRMED AS SOON AS HE TOOK HIS FIRST BIG BITE OF IT IT WAS FAR
BETTER THAN A BREAKFAST HE COULD HAVE HAD THROUGH THE GOOD WILL OF THE
POLICEMEN FROM THE DIRTY CAF
HE FELT WELL AND CONFIDENT HE HAD
FAILED TO GO INTO WORK AT THE BANK THIS MORNING BUT THAT COULD EASILY BE
EXCUSED BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY HIGH POSITION HE HELD THERE
SHOULD
HE REALLY SEND IN HIS EXPLANATION HE WONDERED ABOUT IT
IF NOBODY
BELIEVED HIM AND IN THIS CASE THAT WOULD BE UNDERSTANDABLE HE COULD
BRING MRS
GRUBACH IN AS A WITNESS OR EVEN THE OLD PAIR FROM ACROSS THE
STREET WHO PROBABLY EVEN NOW WERE ON THEIR WAY OVER TO THE WINDOW
OPPOSITE
IT PUZZLED K AT LEAST IT PUZZLED HIM LOOKING AT IT FROM THE
POLICEMEN'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THEY HAD MADE HIM GO INTO THE ROOM AND
LEFT HIM ALONE THERE WHERE HE HAD TEN DIFFERENT WAYS OF KILLING
HIMSELF
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH HE ASKED HIMSELF THIS TIME LOOKING
AT IT FROM HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW WHAT REASON HE COULD HAVE TO DO SO
BECAUSE THOSE TWO WERE SITTING THERE IN THE NEXT ROOM AND HAD TAKEN HIS
BREAKFAST PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO POINTLESS TO KILL HIMSELF
THAT EVEN IF HE HAD WANTED TO THE POINTLESSNESS WOULD HAVE MADE HIM
UNABLE
MAYBE IF THE POLICEMEN HAD NOT BEEN SO OBVIOUSLY LIMITED IN
THEIR MENTAL ABILITIES IT COULD HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED THAT THEY HAD COME
TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AND SAW NO DANGER IN LEAVING HIM ALONE BECAUSE OF
IT
THEY COULD WATCH NOW IF THEY WANTED AND SEE HOW HE WENT OVER TO
THE CUPBOARD IN THE WALL WHERE HE KEPT A BOTTLE OF GOOD SCHNAPPS HOW HE
FIRST EMPTIED A GLASS OF IT IN PLACE OF HIS BREAKFAST AND HOW HE THEN
TOOK A SECOND GLASSFUL IN ORDER TO GIVE HIMSELF COURAGE THE LAST ONE
JUST AS A PRECAUTION FOR THE UNLIKELY CHANCE IT WOULD BE NEEDED
THEN HE WAS SO STARTLED BY A SHOUT TO HIM FROM THE OTHER ROOM THAT
HE STRUCK HIS TEETH AGAINST THE GLASS
THE SUPERVISOR WANTS TO SEE
YOU A VOICE SAID
IT WAS ONLY THE SHOUT THAT STARTLED HIM THIS CURT
ABRUPT MILITARY SHOUT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED FROM THE
POLICEMAN CALLED FRANZ
IN ITSELF HE FOUND THE ORDER VERY WELCOME
AT LAST HE CALLED BACK LOCKED THE CUPBOARD AND WITHOUT DELAY
HURRIED INTO THE NEXT ROOM
THE TWO POLICEMEN WERE STANDING THERE AND
CHASED HIM BACK INTO HIS BEDROOM AS IF THAT WERE A MATTER OF COURSE
WHAT D'YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING THEY CRIED
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
THE SUPERVISOR DRESSED IN JUST YOUR SHIRT DO YOU HE'D SEE TO IT YOU
GOT A RIGHT THUMPING AND US AND ALL LET GO OF ME FOR GOD'S SAKE
CALLED K WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN PUSHED BACK AS FAR AS HIS WARDROBE IF
YOU ACCOST ME WHEN I'M STILL IN BED YOU CAN'T EXPECT TO FIND ME IN MY
EVENING DRESS THAT WON'T HELP YOU SAID THE POLICEMEN WHO ALWAYS
BECAME VERY QUIET ALMOST SAD WHEN K
BEGAN TO SHOUT AND IN THAT WAY
CONFUSED HIM OR TO SOME EXTENT BROUGHT HIM TO HIS SENSES
RIDICULOUS
FORMALITIES HE GRUMBLED AS HE LIFTED HIS COAT FROM THE CHAIR AND KEPT
IT IN BOTH HIS HANDS FOR A LITTLE WHILE AS IF HOLDING IT OUT FOR THE
POLICEMEN'S INSPECTION
THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS
IT'S GOT TO BE A
BLACK COAT THEY SAID
AT THAT K
THREW THE COAT TO THE FLOOR AND
SAID WITHOUT KNOWING EVEN HIMSELF WHAT HE MEANT BY IT WELL IT'S NOT
GOING TO BE THE MAIN TRIAL AFTER ALL THE POLICEMEN LAUGHED BUT
CONTINUED TO INSIST IT'S GOT TO BE A BLACK COAT WELL THAT'S
ALRIGHT BY ME IF IT MAKES THINGS GO ANY FASTER SAID K
HE OPENED THE
WARDROBE HIMSELF SPENT A LONG TIME SEARCHING THROUGH ALL THE CLOTHES
AND CHOSE HIS BEST BLACK SUIT WHICH HAD A SHORT JACKET THAT HAD GREATLY
SURPRISED THOSE WHO KNEW HIM THEN HE ALSO PULLED OUT A FRESH SHIRT AND
BEGAN CAREFULLY TO GET DRESSED
HE SECRETLY TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE HAD
SUCCEEDED IN SPEEDING THINGS UP BY LETTING THE POLICEMEN FORGET TO MAKE
HIM HAVE A BATH
HE WATCHED THEM TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT REMEMBER AFTER
ALL BUT OF COURSE IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THEM ALTHOUGH WILLEM DID NOT
FORGET TO SEND FRANZ UP TO THE SUPERVISOR WITH THE MESSAGE SAYING THAT
K
WAS GETTING DRESSED
ONCE HE WAS PROPERLY DRESSED K
HAD TO PASS BY WILLEM AS HE WENT
THROUGH THE NEXT ROOM INTO THE ONE BEYOND THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS ALREADY
WIDE OPEN
K
KNEW VERY WELL THAT THIS ROOM HAD RECENTLY BEEN LET TO A
TYPIST CALLED 'MISS BRSTNER'
SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF GOING OUT TO
WORK VERY EARLY AND COMING BACK HOME VERY LATE AND K
HAD NEVER
EXCHANGED MORE THAN A FEW WORDS OF GREETING WITH HER
NOW HER BEDSIDE
TABLE HAD BEEN PULLED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM TO BE USED AS A DESK
FOR THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THE SUPERVISOR SAT BEHIND IT
HE HAD HIS
LEGS CROSSED AND HAD THROWN ONE ARM OVER THE BACKREST OF THE CHAIR
IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM THERE WERE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE LOOKING AT
THE PHOTOGRAPHS BELONGING TO MISS BRSTNER THAT HAD BEEN PUT INTO A
PIECE OF FABRIC ON THE WALL
HUNG UP ON THE HANDLE OF THE OPEN WINDOW
WAS A WHITE BLOUSE
AT THE WINDOW ACROSS THE STREET THERE WAS THE OLD
PAIR AGAIN ALTHOUGH NOW THEIR NUMBER HAD INCREASED AS BEHIND THEM AND
FAR TALLER THAN THEY WERE STOOD A MAN WITH AN OPEN SHIRT THAT SHOWED
HIS CHEST AND A REDDISH GOATEE BEARD WHICH HE SQUEEZED AND TWISTED WITH
HIS FINGERS
JOSEF K ASKED THE SUPERVISOR PERHAPS MERELY TO
ATTRACT K 'S ATTENTION AS HE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM
K
NODDED
I
DARESAY YOU WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY ALL THAT'S BEEN TAKING PLACE THIS
MORNING SAID THE SUPERVISOR AS WITH BOTH HANDS HE PUSHED AWAY THE
FEW ITEMS ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE THE CANDLE AND BOX OF MATCHES A BOOK
AND A PIN CUSHION WHICH LAY THERE AS IF THEY WERE THINGS HE WOULD NEED
FOR HIS OWN BUSINESS
CERTAINLY SAID K AND HE BEGAN TO FEEL
RELAXED NOW THAT AT LAST HE STOOD IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WITH SOME SENSE
SOMEONE WITH WHOM HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT HIS SITUATION
CERTAINLY I'M SURPRISED BUT I'M NOT IN ANY WAY VERY SURPRISED
YOU'RE NOT VERY SURPRISED ASKED THE SUPERVISOR AS HE POSITIONED THE
CANDLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE AND THE OTHER THINGS IN A GROUP AROUND
IT
PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND ME K
HURRIEDLY POINTED OUT
WHAT I MEAN IS HERE K
BROKE OFF WHAT HE WAS SAYING AND LOOKED
ROUND FOR SOMEWHERE TO SIT
I MAY SIT DOWN MAYN'T I HE ASKED
THAT'S NOT USUAL THE SUPERVISOR ANSWERED
WHAT I MEAN IS SAID
K
WITHOUT DELAYING A SECOND TIME THAT YES I AM VERY SURPRISED BUT
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN IN THE WORLD FOR THIRTY YEARS ALREADY AND HAD TO MAKE
YOUR OWN WAY THROUGH EVERYTHING YOURSELF WHICH HAS BEEN MY LOT THEN
YOU BECOME HARDENED TO SURPRISES AND DON'T TAKE THEM TOO HARD
ESPECIALLY NOT WHAT'S HAPPENED TODAY WHY ESPECIALLY NOT WHAT'S
HAPPENED TODAY I WOULDN'T WANT TO SAY THAT I SEE ALL OF THIS AS A
JOKE YOU SEEM TO HAVE GONE TO TOO MUCH TROUBLE MAKING ALL THESE
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THAT
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE MUST BE TAKING PART IN IT
AS WELL AS ALL OF YOU THAT WOULD BE GOING BEYOND WHAT COULD BE A JOKE
SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A JOKE QUITE RIGHT SAID THE
SUPERVISOR LOOKING TO SEE HOW MANY MATCHES WERE LEFT IN THE BOX
BUT
ON THE OTHER HAND K
WENT ON LOOKING ROUND AT EVERYONE THERE AND EVEN
WISHING HE COULD GET THE ATTENTION OF THE THREE WHO WERE LOOKING AT THE
PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE OTHER HAND THIS REALLY CAN'T BE ALL THAT
IMPORTANT
THAT FOLLOWS FROM THE FACT THAT I'VE BEEN INDICTED BUT
CAN'T THINK OF THE SLIGHTEST OFFENCE FOR WHICH I COULD BE INDICTED
BUT EVEN THAT IS ALL BESIDE THE POINT THE MAIN QUESTION IS WHO IS
ISSUING THE INDICTMENT WHAT OFFICE IS CONDUCTING THIS AFFAIR ARE YOU
OFFICIALS NONE OF YOU IS WEARING A UNIFORM UNLESS WHAT YOU ARE
WEARING HERE HE TURNED TOWARDS FRANZ IS MEANT TO BE A UNIFORM
IT'S ACTUALLY MORE OF A TRAVELLING SUIT
I REQUIRE A CLEAR ANSWER TO
ALL THESE QUESTIONS AND I'M QUITE SURE THAT ONCE THINGS HAVE BEEN MADE
CLEAR WE CAN TAKE OUR LEAVE OF EACH OTHER ON THE BEST OF TERMS THE
SUPERVISOR SLAMMED THE BOX OF MATCHES DOWN ON THE TABLE
YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE HE SAID
THESE GENTLEMEN AND I HAVE GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR BUSINESS IN FACT WE KNOW ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT YOU
WE COULD
BE WEARING UNIFORMS AS PROPER AND EXACT AS YOU LIKE AND YOUR SITUATION
WOULDN'T BE ANY THE WORSE FOR IT
AS TO WHETHER YOU'RE ON A CHARGE I
CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY SORT OF CLEAR ANSWER TO THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHETHER YOU ARE OR NOT
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT ABOUT
THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN THAT
MAYBE THESE OFFICERS HAVE
BEEN CHIT CHATTING WITH YOU WELL IF THEY HAVE THAT'S ALL IT IS CHIT
CHAT
I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I CAN GIVE YOU
A BIT OF ADVICE YOU'D BETTER THINK LESS ABOUT US AND WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN TO YOU AND THINK A BIT MORE ABOUT YOURSELF
AND STOP MAKING ALL
THIS FUSS ABOUT YOUR SENSE OF INNOCENCE YOU DON'T MAKE SUCH A BAD
IMPRESSION BUT WITH ALL THIS FUSS YOU'RE DAMAGING IT
AND YOU OUGHT TO
DO A BIT LESS TALKING TOO
ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU'VE SAID SO FAR HAS
BEEN THINGS WE COULD HAVE TAKEN FROM YOUR BEHAVIOUR EVEN IF YOU'D SAID
NO MORE THAN A FEW WORDS
AND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID HAS NOT EXACTLY BEEN
IN YOUR FAVOUR
K
STARED AT THE SUPERVISOR
WAS THIS MAN PROBABLY YOUNGER THAN
HE WAS LECTURING HIM LIKE A SCHOOLMASTER WAS HE BEING PUNISHED FOR
HIS HONESTY WITH A TELLING OFF AND WAS HE TO LEARN NOTHING ABOUT THE
REASONS FOR HIS ARREST OR THOSE WHO WERE ARRESTING HIM HE BECAME
SOMEWHAT CROSS AND BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN
NO ONE STOPPED HIM DOING
THIS AND HE PUSHED HIS SLEEVES BACK FELT HIS CHEST STRAIGHTENED HIS
HAIR WENT OVER TO THE THREE MEN SAID IT MAKES NO SENSE AT WHICH
THESE THREE TURNED ROUND TO FACE HIM AND CAME TOWARDS HIM WITH SERIOUS
EXPRESSIONS
HE FINALLY CAME AGAIN TO A HALT IN FRONT OF THE
SUPERVISOR'S DESK
STATE ATTORNEY HASTERER IS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE
HE SAID CAN I TELEPHONE HIM CERTAINLY SAID THE SUPERVISOR BUT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POINT OF THAT WILL BE I SUPPOSE YOU MUST HAVE
SOME PRIVATE MATTER YOU WANT TO DISCUSS WITH HIM WHAT THE POINT IS
SHOUTED K MORE DISCONCERTED THAT CROSS
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
YOU WANT TO SEE SOME POINT IN IT WHILE YOU'RE CARRYING OUT SOMETHING AS
POINTLESS AS IT COULD BE IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU CRY THESE GENTLEMEN
FIRST ACCOST ME AND NOW THEY SIT OR STAND ABOUT IN HERE AND LET ME BE
HAULED UP IN FRONT OF YOU
WHAT POINT THERE WOULD BE IN TELEPHONING A
STATE ATTORNEY WHEN I'M OSTENSIBLY UNDER ARREST VERY WELL I WON'T
MAKE THE TELEPHONE CALL YOU CAN CALL HIM IF YOU WANT TO SAID THE
SUPERVISOR STRETCHING HIS HAND OUT TOWARDS THE OUTER ROOM WHERE THE
TELEPHONE WAS PLEASE GO ON DO MAKE YOUR PHONE CALL NO I DON'T
WANT TO ANY MORE SAID K AND WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW
ACROSS THE
STREET THE PEOPLE WERE STILL THERE AT THE WINDOW AND IT WAS ONLY NOW
THAT K
HAD GONE UP TO HIS WINDOW THAT THEY SEEMED TO BECOME UNEASY
ABOUT QUIETLY WATCHING WHAT WAS GOING ON
THE OLD COUPLE WANTED TO GET
UP BUT THE MAN BEHIND THEM CALMED THEM DOWN
WE'VE GOT SOME KIND OF
AUDIENCE OVER THERE CALLED K
TO THE SUPERVISOR QUITE LOUDLY AS HE
POINTED OUT WITH HIS FOREFINGER
GO AWAY HE THEN CALLED ACROSS TO
THEM
AND THE THREE OF THEM DID IMMEDIATELY RETREAT A FEW STEPS THE
OLD PAIR EVEN FOUND THEMSELVES BEHIND THE MAN WHO THEN CONCEALED THEM
WITH THE BREADTH OF HIS BODY AND SEEMED GOING BY THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS
MOUTH TO BE SAYING SOMETHING INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTO THE DISTANCE
THEY
DID NOT DISAPPEAR ENTIRELY THOUGH BUT SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR THE
MOMENT WHEN THEY COULD COME BACK TO THE WINDOW WITHOUT BEING NOTICED
INTRUSIVE THOUGHTLESS PEOPLE SAID K
AS HE TURNED BACK INTO THE
ROOM
THE SUPERVISOR MAY HAVE AGREED WITH HIM AT LEAST K
THOUGHT THAT
WAS WHAT HE SAW FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE
BUT IT WAS JUST AS POSSIBLE
THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN LISTENING AS HE HAD HIS HAND PRESSED FIRMLY
DOWN ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO BE COMPARING THE LENGTH OF HIS FINGERS
THE TWO POLICEMEN WERE SITTING ON A CHEST COVERED WITH A COLOURED
BLANKET RUBBING THEIR KNEES
THE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD PUT THEIR
HANDS ON THEIR HIPS AND WERE LOOKING ROUND AIMLESSLY
EVERYTHING WAS
STILL LIKE IN SOME OFFICE THAT HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN ABOUT
NOW
GENTLEMEN CALLED OUT K AND FOR A MOMENT IT SEEMED AS IF HE WAS
CARRYING ALL OF THEM ON HIS SHOULDERS IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR BUSINESS WITH
ME IS OVER WITH
IN MY OPINION IT'S BEST NOW TO STOP WONDERING ABOUT
WHETHER YOU'RE PROCEEDING CORRECTLY OR INCORRECTLY AND TO BRING THE
MATTER TO A PEACEFUL CLOSE WITH A MUTUAL HANDSHAKE
IF YOU ARE OF THE
SAME OPINION THEN PLEASE AND HE WALKED UP TO THE SUPERVISOR'S DESK
AND HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HIM
THE SUPERVISOR RAISED HIS EYES BIT HIS
LIP AND LOOKED AT K 'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND K STILL BELIEVED THE
SUPERVISOR WOULD DO AS HE SUGGESTED
BUT INSTEAD HE STOOD UP PICKED
UP A HARD ROUND HAT THAT WAS LAYING ON MISS BRSTNER'S BED AND PUT IT
CAREFULLY ONTO HIS HEAD USING BOTH HANDS AS IF TRYING ON A NEW HAT
EVERYTHING SEEMS SO SIMPLE TO YOU DOESN'T IT HE SAID TO K
AS HE DID
SO SO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BRING THE MATTER TO A PEACEFUL CLOSE DO
YOU
NO NO THAT WON'T DO
MIND YOU ON THE OTHER HAND I CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK THERE'S NO HOPE FOR YOU
NO WHY SHOULD YOU
THINK THAT YOU'RE SIMPLY UNDER ARREST NOTHING MORE THAN THAT
THAT'S
WHAT I HAD TO TELL YOU THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE AND NOW I'VE SEEN HOW
YOU'VE TAKEN IT
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY AND WE CAN TAKE OUR LEAVE OF
EACH OTHER FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST
I EXPECT YOU'LL WANT TO GO IN
TO THE BANK NOW WON'T YOU IN TO THE BANK ASKED K I THOUGHT I
WAS UNDER ARREST K
SAID THIS WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEFIANCE AS
ALTHOUGH HIS HANDSHAKE HAD NOT BEEN ACCEPTED HE WAS FEELING MORE
INDEPENDENT OF ALL THESE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SUPERVISOR HAD
STOOD UP
HE WAS PLAYING WITH THEM
IF THEY LEFT HE HAD DECIDED HE
WOULD RUN AFTER THEM AND OFFER TO LET THEM ARREST HIM
THAT'S WHY HE
EVEN REPEATED HOW CAN I GO IN TO THE BANK WHEN I'M UNDER ARREST I
SEE YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD ME SAID THE SUPERVISOR WHO WAS ALREADY AT THE
DOOR
IT'S TRUE THAT YOU'RE UNDER ARREST BUT THAT SHOULDN'T STOP YOU
FROM CARRYING OUT YOUR JOB
AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING TO STOP YOU
CARRYING ON WITH YOUR USUAL LIFE IN THAT CASE IT'S NOT TOO BAD
BEING UNDER ARREST SAID K AND WENT UP CLOSE TO THE SUPERVISOR
I
NEVER MEANT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE HE REPLIED
IT HARDLY SEEMS
TO HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO NOTIFY ME OF THE ARREST IN THAT CASE SAID K
AND WENT EVEN CLOSER
THE OTHERS HAD ALSO COME CLOSER
ALL OF THEM HAD
GATHERED TOGETHER INTO A NARROW SPACE BY THE DOOR
THAT WAS MY DUTY
SAID THE SUPERVISOR
A SILLY DUTY SAID K UNYIELDING
MAYBE SO
REPLIED THE SUPERVISOR ONLY DON'T LET'S WASTE OUR TIME TALKING ON LIKE
THIS
I HAD ASSUMED YOU'D BE WANTING TO GO TO THE BANK
AS YOU'RE
PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO EVERY WORD I'LL ADD THIS I'M NOT FORCING YOU
TO GO TO THE BANK I'D JUST ASSUMED YOU WANTED TO
AND TO MAKE THINGS
EASIER FOR YOU AND TO LET YOU GET TO THE BANK WITH AS LITTLE FUSS AS
POSSIBLE I'VE PUT THESE THREE GENTLEMEN COLLEAGUES OF YOURS AT YOUR
DISPOSAL WHAT'S THAT EXCLAIMED K AND LOOKED AT THE THREE IN
ASTONISHMENT
HE COULD ONLY REMEMBER SEEING THEM IN THEIR GROUP BY THE
PHOTOGRAPHS BUT THESE CHARACTERLESS ANAEMIC YOUNG PEOPLE WERE INDEED
OFFICIALS FROM HIS BANK NOT COLLEAGUES OF HIS THAT WAS PUTTING IT TOO
HIGH AND IT SHOWED A GAP IN THE OMNISCIENCE OF THE SUPERVISOR BUT THEY
WERE NONETHELESS JUNIOR MEMBERS OF STAFF AT THE BANK
HOW COULD K
HAVE
FAILED TO SEE THAT HOW OCCUPIED HE MUST HAVE BEEN WITH THE SUPERVISOR
AND THE POLICEMEN NOT TO HAVE RECOGNISED THESE THREE RABENSTEINER
WITH HIS STIFF DEMEANOUR AND SWINGING HANDS KULLICH WITH HIS BLONDE
HAIR AND DEEP SET EYES AND KAMINER WITH HIS INVOLUNTARY GRIN CAUSED BY
CHRONIC MUSCLE SPASMS
GOOD MORNING SAID K
AFTER A WHILE EXTENDING
HIS HAND TO THE GENTLEMEN AS THEY BOWED CORRECTLY TO HIM
I DIDN'T
RECOGNISE YOU AT ALL
SO WE'LL GO INTO WORK NOW SHALL WE THE
GENTLEMEN LAUGHED AND NODDED ENTHUSIASTICALLY AS IF THAT WAS WHAT THEY
HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ALL THE TIME EXCEPT THAT K
HAD LEFT HIS HAT IN
HIS ROOM SO THEY ALL DASHED ONE AFTER ANOTHER INTO THE ROOM TO FETCH
IT WHICH CAUSED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF EMBARRASSMENT
K
STOOD WHERE HE
WAS AND WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE OPEN DOUBLE DOORWAY THE LAST TO GO OF
COURSE WAS THE APATHETIC RABENSTEINER WHO HAD BROKEN INTO NO MORE THAN
AN ELEGANT TROT
KAMINER GOT TO THE HAT AND K AS HE OFTEN HAD TO DO
AT THE BANK FORCIBLY REMINDED HIMSELF THAT THE GRIN WAS NOT DELIBERATE
THAT HE IN FACT WASN'T ABLE TO GRIN DELIBERATELY
AT THAT MOMENT MRS
GRUBACH OPENED THE DOOR FROM THE HALLWAY INTO THE LIVING ROOM WHERE ALL
THE PEOPLE WERE
SHE DID NOT SEEM TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL
AND K AS OFTEN BEFORE LOOKED DOWN AT THE BELT OF HER APRON WHICH FOR
NO REASON CUT SO DEEPLY INTO HER HEFTY BODY
ONCE DOWNSTAIRS K WITH
HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND DECIDED TO TAKE A TAXI HE HAD ALREADY BEEN
DELAYED BY HALF AN HOUR AND THERE WAS NO NEED TO MAKE THE DELAY ANY
LONGER
KAMINER RAN TO THE CORNER TO SUMMON IT AND THE TWO OTHERS WERE
MAKING OBVIOUS EFFORTS TO KEEP K
DIVERTED WHEN KULLICH POINTED TO THE
DOORWAY OF THE HOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WHERE THE LARGE MAN
WITH THE BLONDE GOATEE BEARD APPEARED AND A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AT FIRST
AT LETTING HIMSELF BE SEEN IN HIS FULL HEIGHT STEPPED BACK TO THE WALL
AND LEANT AGAINST IT
THE OLD COUPLE WERE PROBABLY STILL ON THE STAIRS
K
WAS CROSS WITH KULLICH FOR POINTING OUT THIS MAN WHOM HE HAD ALREADY
SEEN HIMSELF IN FACT WHOM HE HAD BEEN EXPECTING
DON'T LOOK AT HIM
HE SNAPPED WITHOUT NOTICING HOW ODD IT WAS TO SPEAK TO FREE MEN IN THIS
WAY
BUT THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION NEEDED ANYWAY AS JUST THEN THE TAXI
ARRIVED THEY SAT INSIDE AND SET OFF
INSIDE THE TAXI K
REMEMBERED
THAT HE HAD NOT NOTICED THE SUPERVISOR AND THE POLICEMEN LEAVING THE
SUPERVISOR HAD STOPPED HIM NOTICING THE THREE BANK STAFF AND NOW THE
THREE BANK STAFF HAD STOPPED HIM NOTICING THE SUPERVISOR
THIS SHOWED
THAT K
WAS NOT VERY ATTENTIVE AND HE RESOLVED TO WATCH HIMSELF MORE
CAREFULLY IN THIS RESPECT
NONETHELESS HE GAVE IT NO THOUGHT AS HE
TWISTED HIMSELF ROUND AND LEANT OVER ONTO THE REAR SHELF OF THE CAR TO
CATCH SIGHT OF THE SUPERVISOR AND THE POLICEMEN IF HE COULD
BUT HE
TURNED BACK ROUND STRAIGHT AWAY AND LEANT COMFORTABLY INTO THE CORNER OF
THE TAXI WITHOUT EVEN HAVING MADE THE EFFORT TO SEE ANYONE
ALTHOUGH IT
DID NOT SEEM LIKE IT NOW WAS JUST THE TIME WHEN HE NEEDED SOME
ENCOURAGEMENT BUT THE GENTLEMEN SEEMED TIRED JUST THEN RABENSTEINER
LOOKED OUT OF THE CAR TO THE RIGHT KULLICH TO THE LEFT AND ONLY KAMINER
WAS THERE WITH HIS GRIN AT K 'S SERVICE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INHUMANE TO
MAKE FUN OF THAT
THAT SPRING WHENEVER POSSIBLE K
USUALLY SPENT HIS EVENINGS
AFTER WORK HE USUALLY STAYED IN THE OFFICE UNTIL NINE O'CLOCK WITH A
SHORT WALK EITHER BY HIMSELF OR IN THE COMPANY OF SOME OF THE BANK
OFFICIALS AND THEN HE WOULD GO INTO A PUB WHERE HE WOULD SIT AT THE
REGULARS' TABLE WITH MOSTLY OLDER MEN UNTIL ELEVEN
THERE WERE
HOWEVER ALSO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS HABIT TIMES FOR INSTANCE WHEN K
WAS
INVITED BY THE BANK'S MANAGER WHOM HE GREATLY RESPECTED FOR HIS
INDUSTRY AND TRUSTWORTHINESS TO GO WITH HIM FOR A RIDE IN HIS CAR OR TO
EAT DINNER WITH HIM AT HIS LARGE HOUSE
K
WOULD ALSO GO ONCE A WEEK
TO SEE A GIRL CALLED ELSA WHO WORKED AS A WAITRESS IN A WINE BAR THROUGH
THE NIGHT UNTIL LATE IN THE MORNING
DURING THE DAYTIME SHE ONLY
RECEIVED VISITORS WHILE STILL IN BED
THAT EVENING THOUGH THE DAY HAD PASSED QUICKLY WITH A LOT OF
HARD WORK AND MANY RESPECTFUL AND FRIENDLY BIRTHDAY GREETINGS K
WANTED TO GO STRAIGHT HOME
EACH TIME HE HAD ANY SMALL BREAK FROM THE
DAY'S WORK HE CONSIDERED WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT HE HAD IN MIND
THAT MRS
GRUBACH'S FLAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PUT INTO GREAT DISARRAY BY
THE EVENTS OF THAT MORNING AND THAT IT WAS UP TO HIM TO PUT IT BACK
INTO ORDER
ONCE ORDER HAD BEEN RESTORED EVERY TRACE OF THOSE EVENTS
WOULD HAVE BEEN ERASED AND EVERYTHING WOULD TAKE ITS PREVIOUS COURSE
ONCE MORE
IN PARTICULAR THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE THREE BANK
OFFICIALS THEY HAD IMMERSED THEMSELVES BACK INTO THEIR PAPERWORK AND
THERE WAS NO ALTERATION TO BE SEEN IN THEM
K
HAD CALLED EACH OF THEM
SEPARATELY OR ALL TOGETHER INTO HIS OFFICE THAT DAY FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN TO OBSERVE THEM HE WAS ALWAYS SATISFIED AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN ABLE
TO LET THEM GO AGAIN
AT HALF PAST NINE THAT EVENING WHEN HE ARRIVED BACK IN FRONT OF
THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HE MET A YOUNG LAD IN THE DOORWAY WHO WAS
STANDING THERE HIS LEGS APART AND SMOKING A PIPE
WHO ARE YOU
IMMEDIATELY ASKED K BRINGING HIS FACE CLOSE TO THE LAD'S AS IT WAS
HARD TO SEE IN THE HALF LIGHT OF THE LANDING
I'M THE LANDLORD'S SON
SIR ANSWERED THE LAD TAKING THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH AND STEPPING TO
ONE SIDE
THE LANDLORD'S SON ASKED K AND IMPATIENTLY KNOCKED ON
THE GROUND WITH HIS STICK
DID YOU WANT ANYTHING SIR WOULD YOU LIKE
ME TO FETCH MY FATHER NO NO SAID K THERE WAS SOMETHING
FORGIVING IN HIS VOICE AS IF THE BOY HAD HARMED HIM IN SOME WAY AND HE
WAS EXCUSING HIM
IT'S ALRIGHT HE SAID THEN AND WENT ON BUT BEFORE
GOING UP THE STAIRS HE TURNED ROUND ONCE MORE
HE COULD HAVE GONE DIRECTLY TO HIS ROOM BUT AS HE WANTED TO SPEAK
WITH MRS
GRUBACH HE WENT STRAIGHT TO HER DOOR AND KNOCKED
SHE WAS SAT
AT THE TABLE WITH A KNITTED STOCKING AND A PILE OF OLD STOCKINGS IN
FRONT OF HER
K
APOLOGISED A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AT COMING SO LATE
BUT MRS
GRUBACH WAS VERY FRIENDLY AND DID NOT WANT TO HEAR ANY APOLOGY
SHE WAS ALWAYS READY TO SPEAK TO HIM HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT HE WAS HER
BEST AND HER FAVOURITE TENANT
K
LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM IT LOOKED
EXACTLY AS IT USUALLY DID THE BREAKFAST DISHES WHICH HAD BEEN ON THE
TABLE BY THE WINDOW THAT MORNING HAD ALREADY BEEN CLEARED AWAY
A
WOMAN'S HANDS WILL DO MANY THINGS WHEN NO ONE'S LOOKING HE THOUGHT HE
MIGHT HIMSELF HAVE SMASHED ALL THE DISHES ON THE SPOT BUT CERTAINLY
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY IT ALL OUT
HE LOOKED AT MRS
GRUBACH
WITH SOME GRATITUDE
WHY ARE YOU WORKING SO LATE HE ASKED
THEY
WERE NOW BOTH SITTING AT THE TABLE AND K
NOW AND THEN SANK HIS HANDS
INTO THE PILE OF STOCKINGS
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO SHE SAID
DURING THE DAY I BELONG TO THE TENANTS IF I'M TO SORT OUT MY OWN
THINGS THERE ARE ONLY THE EVENINGS LEFT TO ME I FEAR I MAY HAVE
CAUSED YOU SOME EXCEPTIONAL WORK TODAY HOW DO YOU MEAN MR
K SHE
ASKED BECOMING MORE INTERESTED AND LEAVING HER WORK IN HER LAP
I
MEAN THE MEN WHO WERE HERE THIS MORNING OH I SEE SHE SAID AND
WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO WHAT SHE WAS DOING THAT WAS NO TROUBLE NOT
ESPECIALLY K
LOOKED ON IN SILENCE AS SHE TOOK UP THE KNITTED
STOCKING ONCE MORE
SHE SEEMS SURPRISED AT MY MENTIONING IT HE
THOUGHT SHE SEEMS TO THINK IT'S IMPROPER FOR ME TO MENTION IT
ALL THE
MORE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO DO SO
AN OLD WOMAN IS THE ONLY PERSON I CAN
SPEAK ABOUT IT WITH
BUT IT MUST HAVE CAUSED SOME WORK FOR YOU HE
SAID THEN BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN NO IT CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN SHE
AGREED AND SMILED AT K
IN A WAY THAT WAS ALMOST PAINED
DO YOU MEAN
THAT SERIOUSLY ASKED K
YES SHE SAID MORE GENTLY BUT THE
IMPORTANT THING IS YOU MUSTN'T TAKE IT TOO HARD
THERE ARE SO MANY
AWFUL THINGS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AS YOU'RE BEING SO HONEST WITH ME
MR
K I CAN ADMIT TO YOU THAT I LISTENED TO A LITTLE OF WHAT WAS GOING
ON FROM BEHIND THE DOOR AND THAT THOSE TWO POLICEMEN TOLD ME ONE OR TWO
THINGS AS WELL
IT'S ALL TO DO WITH YOUR HAPPINESS AND THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE CLOSE TO MY HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN IT SHOULD BE
AS I AM AFTER ALL ONLY YOUR LANDLADY
ANYWAY SO I HEARD ONE OR TWO
THINGS BUT I CAN'T REALLY SAY THAT IT'S ABOUT ANYTHING VERY SERIOUS
NO
YOU HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BUT IT'S NOT IN THE SAME WAY AS WHEN THEY
ARREST A THIEF
IF YOU'RE ARRESTED IN THE SAME WAY AS A THIEF THEN
IT'S BAD BUT AN ARREST LIKE THIS
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S
SOMETHING VERY COMPLICATED FORGIVE ME IF I'M SAYING SOMETHING STUPID
SOMETHING VERY COMPLICATED THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT SOMETHING THAT
YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND ANYWAY
THERE'S NOTHING STUPID ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE SAID MRS
GRUBACH OR
AT LEAST I PARTLY AGREE WITH YOU ONLY THE WAY I JUDGE THE WHOLE THING
IS HARSHER THAN YOURS AND THINK IT'S NOT ONLY NOT SOMETHING COMPLICATED
BUT SIMPLY A FUSS ABOUT NOTHING
I WAS JUST CAUGHT UNAWARES THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED
IF I HAD GOT UP AS SOON AS I WAS AWAKE WITHOUT LETTING
MYSELF GET CONFUSED BECAUSE ANNA WASN'T THERE IF I'D GOT UP AND PAID NO
REGARD TO ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MY WAY AND COME STRAIGHT TO YOU
IF I'D DONE SOMETHING LIKE HAVING MY BREAKFAST IN THE KITCHEN AS AN
EXCEPTION ASKED YOU TO BRING MY CLOTHES FROM MY ROOM IN SHORT IF I
HAD BEHAVED SENSIBLY THEN NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE HAPPENED EVERYTHING
THAT WAS WAITING TO HAPPEN WOULD HAVE BEEN STIFLED
PEOPLE ARE SO OFTEN
UNPREPARED
IN THE BANK FOR EXAMPLE I AM WELL PREPARED NOTHING OF
THIS SORT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO ME THERE I HAVE MY OWN ASSISTANT
THERE THERE ARE TELEPHONES FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CALLS IN FRONT OF
ME ON THE DESK I CONTINUALLY RECEIVE VISITS FROM PEOPLE
REPRESENTATIVES OFFICIALS BUT BESIDES THAT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I'M
ALWAYS OCCUPIED WITH MY WORK THAT'S TO SAY I'M ALWAYS ALERT IT WOULD
EVEN BE A PLEASURE FOR ME TO FIND MYSELF FACED WITH SOMETHING OF THAT
SORT
BUT NOW IT'S OVER WITH AND I DIDN'T REALLY EVEN WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT ANY MORE ONLY I WANTED TO HEAR WHAT YOU AS A SENSIBLE WOMAN
THOUGHT ABOUT IT ALL AND I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT WE'RE IN AGREEMENT
BUT NOW YOU MUST GIVE ME YOUR HAND AN AGREEMENT OF THIS SORT NEEDS TO
BE CONFIRMED WITH A HANDSHAKE
WILL SHE SHAKE HANDS WITH ME THE SUPERVISOR DIDN'T SHAKE HANDS
HE THOUGHT AND LOOKED AT THE WOMAN DIFFERENTLY FROM BEFORE EXAMINING
HER
SHE STOOD UP AS HE HAD ALSO STOOD UP AND WAS A LITTLE SELF
CONSCIOUS SHE HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT K
SAID
AS A RESULT OF THIS SELF CONSCIOUSNESS SHE SAID SOMETHING THAT
SHE CERTAINLY DID NOT INTEND AND CERTAINLY WAS NOT APPROPRIATE
DON'T
TAKE IT SO HARD MR
K SHE SAID WITH TEARS IN HER VOICE AND ALSO OF
COURSE FORGETTING THE HANDSHAKE
I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS TAKING IT HARD
SAID K FEELING SUDDENLY TIRED AND SEEING THAT IF THIS WOMAN DID AGREE
WITH HIM IT WAS OF VERY LITTLE VALUE
BEFORE GOING OUT THE DOOR HE ASKED IS MISS BRSTNER HOME
NO SAID MRS
GRUBACH SMILING AS SHE GAVE THIS SIMPLE PIECE OF
INFORMATION SAYING SOMETHING SENSIBLE AT LAST
SHE'S AT THE THEATRE
DID YOU WANT TO SEE HER SHOULD I GIVE HER A MESSAGE I ER I JUST
WANTED TO HAVE A FEW WORDS WITH HER I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW WHEN
SHE'S COMING IN SHE USUALLY GETS BACK LATE WHEN SHE'S BEEN TO THE
THEATRE IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER SAID K
HIS HEAD HANGING AS HE
TURNED TO THE DOOR TO LEAVE I JUST WANTED TO GIVE HER MY APOLOGY FOR
TAKING OVER HER ROOM TODAY THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT MR
K YOU'RE
TOO CONSCIENTIOUS THE YOUNG LADY DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SHE
HASN'T BEEN HOME SINCE EARLY THIS MORNING AND EVERYTHING'S BEEN TIDIED
UP AGAIN YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF AND SHE OPENED THE DOOR TO MISS
BRSTNER'S ROOM
THANK YOU I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT SAID K BUT
WENT NONETHELESS OVER TO THE OPEN DOOR
THE MOON SHONE QUIETLY INTO THE
UNLIT ROOM
AS FAR AS COULD BE SEEN EVERYTHING WAS INDEED IN ITS
PLACE NOT EVEN THE BLOUSE WAS HANGING ON THE WINDOW HANDLE
THE
PILLOWS ON THE BED LOOKED REMARKABLY PLUMP AS THEY LAY HALF IN THE
MOONLIGHT
MISS BRSTNER OFTEN COMES HOME LATE SAID K LOOKING AT
MRS
GRUBACH AS IF THAT WERE HER RESPONSIBILITY
THAT'S HOW YOUNG
PEOPLE ARE SAID MRS
GRUBACH TO EXCUSE HERSELF
OF COURSE OF
COURSE SAID K BUT IT CAN BE TAKEN TOO FAR YES IT CAN BE SAID
MRS
GRUBACH YOU'RE SO RIGHT MR
K
PERHAPS IT IS IN THIS CASE
I
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING NASTY ABOUT MISS BRSTNER SHE
IS A GOOD SWEET GIRL FRIENDLY TIDY PUNCTUAL WORKS HARD I
APPRECIATE ALL THAT VERY MUCH BUT ONE THING IS TRUE SHE OUGHT TO HAVE
MORE PRIDE BE A BIT LESS FORTHCOMING
TWICE THIS MONTH ALREADY IN THE
STREET OVER THE WAY I'VE SEEN HER WITH A DIFFERENT GENTLEMAN
I REALLY
DON'T LIKE SAYING THIS YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I'VE SAID THIS TO MR
K I
SWEAR TO GOD BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE A FEW WORDS
WITH MISS BRSTNER ABOUT IT MYSELF
AND IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING ABOUT
HER THAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT MRS
GRUBACH YOU ARE ON QUITE THE WRONG
TRACK SAID K SO ANGRY THAT HE WAS HARDLY ABLE TO HIDE IT AND YOU
HAVE MOREOVER MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT MISS BRSTNER THAT
IS NOT WHAT I MEANT
IN FACT I WARN YOU QUITE DIRECTLY NOT TO SAY
ANYTHING TO HER YOU ARE QUITE MISTAKEN I KNOW MISS BRSTNER VERY WELL
AND THERE IS NO TRUTH AT ALL IN WHAT YOU SAY
AND WHAT'S MORE PERHAPS
I'M GOING TO FAR I DON'T WANT TO GET IN YOUR WAY SAY TO HER WHATEVER
YOU SEE FIT
GOOD NIGHT MR
K SAID MRS
GRUBACH AS IF ASKING HIM
FOR SOMETHING AND HURRYING TO HIS DOOR WHICH HE HAD ALREADY OPENED I
DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO MISS BRSTNER AT ALL NOT YET OF COURSE I'LL
CONTINUE TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE I'VE TOLD WHAT I
KNOW
AND IT IS AFTER ALL SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE WHO LETS ROOMS HAS
TO DO IF SHE'S TO KEEP THE HOUSE DECENT THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO DO
DECENT CALLED OUT K
THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE DOOR IF YOU WANT TO
KEEP THE HOUSE DECENT YOU'LL FIRST HAVE TO GIVE ME NOTICE THEN HE
SLAMMED THE DOOR SHUT THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCKING TO WHICH HE PAID NO
MORE ATTENTION
HE DID NOT FEEL AT ALL LIKE GOING TO BED SO HE DECIDED TO STAY
UP AND THIS WOULD ALSO GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHEN MISS
BRSTNER WOULD ARRIVE HOME
PERHAPS IT WOULD ALSO STILL BE POSSIBLE
EVEN IF A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE A FEW WORDS WITH HER
AS HE LAY
THERE BY THE WINDOW PRESSING HIS HANDS TO HIS TIRED EYES HE EVEN
THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT HE MIGHT PUNISH MRS
GRUBACH BY PERSUADING
MISS BRSTNER TO GIVE IN HER NOTICE AT THE SAME TIME AS HE WOULD
BUT
HE IMMEDIATELY REALISED THAT THAT WOULD BE SHOCKINGLY EXCESSIVE AND
THERE WOULD EVEN BE THE SUSPICION THAT HE WAS MOVING HOUSE BECAUSE OF
THE INCIDENTS OF THAT MORNING
NOTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE NONSENSICAL
AND ABOVE ALL MORE POINTLESS AND CONTEMPTIBLE
WHEN HE HAD BECOME TIRED OF LOOKING OUT ONTO THE EMPTY STREET HE
SLIGHTLY OPENED THE DOOR TO THE LIVING ROOM SO THAT HE COULD SEE ANYONE
WHO ENTERED THE FLAT FROM WHERE HE WAS AND LAY DOWN ON THE COUCH
HE
LAY THERE QUIETLY SMOKING A CIGAR UNTIL ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
HE
WASN'T ABLE TO HOLD OUT LONGER THAN THAT AND WENT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE
HALLWAY AS IF IN THAT WAY HE COULD MAKE MISS BRSTNER ARRIVE SOONER
HE
HAD NO PARTICULAR DESIRE FOR HER HE COULD NOT EVEN REMEMBER WHAT SHE
LOOKED LIKE BUT NOW HE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HER AND IT IRRITATED HIM THAT
HER LATE ARRIVAL HOME MEANT THIS DAY WOULD BE FULL OF UNEASE AND
DISORDER RIGHT TO ITS VERY END
IT WAS ALSO HER FAULT THAT HE HAD NOT
HAD ANY DINNER THAT EVENING AND THAT HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO VISIT ELSA AS
HE HAD INTENDED
HE COULD STILL MAKE UP FOR BOTH OF THOSE THINGS
THOUGH IF HE WENT TO THE WINE BAR WHERE ELSA WORKED
HE WANTED TO DO
SO EVEN LATER AFTER THE DISCUSSION WITH MISS BRSTNER
IT WAS ALREADY GONE HALF PAST ELEVEN WHEN SOMEONE COULD BE HEARD
IN THE STAIRWAY
K WHO HAD BEEN LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS IN THE HALLWAY
WALKING UP AND DOWN LOUDLY AS IF IT WERE HIS OWN ROOM FLED BEHIND HIS
DOOR
MISS BRSTNER HAD ARRIVED
SHIVERING SHE PULLED A SILK SHAWL
OVER HER SLENDER SHOULDERS AS SHE LOCKED THE DOOR
THE NEXT MOMENT SHE
WOULD CERTAINLY GO INTO HER ROOM WHERE K
OUGHT NOT TO INTRUDE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT MEANT HE WOULD HAVE TO SPEAK TO HER NOW BUT
UNFORTUNATELY HE HAD NOT PUT THE ELECTRIC LIGHT ON IN HIS ROOM SO THAT
WHEN HE STEPPED OUT OF THE DARK IT WOULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING AN
ATTACK AND WOULD CERTAINLY AT THE VERY LEAST HAVE BEEN QUITE ALARMING
THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE AND IN HIS HELPLESSNESS HE WHISPERED THROUGH
THE CRACK OF THE DOOR MISS BRSTNER IT SOUNDED LIKE HE WAS PLEADING
WITH HER NOT CALLING TO HER
IS THERE SOMEONE THERE ASKED MISS
BRSTNER LOOKING ROUND WITH HER EYES WIDE OPEN
IT'S ME SAID K
AND
CAME OUT
OH MR
K SAID MISS BRSTNER WITH A SMILE
GOOD
EVENING AND OFFERED HIM HER HAND
I WANTED TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU
IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME NOW ASKED MISS BRSTNER DOES IT HAVE TO BE
NOW IT IS A LITTLE ODD ISN'T IT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU SINCE
NINE O'CLOCK WELL I WAS AT THE THEATRE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU WAITING FOR ME THE REASON I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU ONLY CAME
UP TODAY I SEE WELL I DON'T SEE WHY NOT I SUPPOSE APART FROM BEING
SO TIRED I COULD DROP
COME INTO MY ROOM FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN
WE
CERTAINLY CAN'T TALK OUT HERE WE'D WAKE EVERYONE UP AND I THINK THAT
WOULD BE MORE UNPLEASANT FOR US THAN FOR THEM
WAIT HERE TILL I'VE PUT
THE LIGHT ON IN MY ROOM AND THEN TURN THE LIGHT DOWN OUT HERE K
DID
AS HE WAS TOLD AND THEN EVEN WAITED UNTIL MISS BRSTNER CAME OUT OF HER
ROOM AND QUIETLY INVITED HIM ONCE MORE TO COME IN
SIT DOWN SHE
SAID INDICATING THE OTTOMAN WHILE SHE HERSELF REMAINED STANDING BY THE
BEDPOST DESPITE THE TIREDNESS SHE HAD SPOKEN OF SHE DID NOT EVEN TAKE
OFF HER HAT WHICH WAS SMALL BUT DECORATED WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF FLOWERS
WHAT IS IT YOU WANTED THEN I'M REALLY QUITE CURIOUS SHE GENTLY
CROSSED HER LEGS
I EXPECT YOU'LL SAY K
BEGAN THAT THE MATTER REALLY ISN'T ALL THAT
URGENT AND WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW BUT I NEVER
LISTEN TO INTRODUCTIONS SAID MISS BRSTNER
THAT MAKES MY JOB SO
MUCH EASIER SAID K
THIS MORNING TO SOME EXTENT THROUGH MY FAULT
YOUR ROOM WAS MADE A LITTLE UNTIDY THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF PEOPLE I
DID NOT KNOW AND AGAINST MY WILL BUT AS I SAID BECAUSE OF MY FAULT I
WANTED TO APOLOGISE FOR IT MY ROOM ASKED MISS BRSTNER AND
INSTEAD OF LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM SCRUTINISED K
IT IS TRUE SAID K
AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY LOOKED EACH OTHER IN THE EYES
THERE'S NO POINT IN SAYING EXACTLY HOW THIS CAME ABOUT BUT THAT'S
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT IT SAID MISS BRSTNER
NO SAID K
WELL THEN SAID MISS BRSTNER I DON'T WANT TO FORCE MY WAY INTO ANY
SECRETS IF YOU INSIST THAT IT'S OF NO INTEREST I WON'T INSIST
I'M
QUITE HAPPY TO FORGIVE YOU FOR IT AS YOU ASK ESPECIALLY AS I CAN'T SEE
ANYTHING AT ALL THAT'S BEEN LEFT UNTIDY WITH HER HAND LAID FLAT ON
HER LOWER HIP SHE MADE A TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
AT THE MAT WHERE THE
PHOTOGRAPHS WERE SHE STOPPED
LOOK AT THIS SHE CRIED
MY
PHOTOGRAPHS REALLY HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE WRONG PLACES
OH THAT'S
HORRIBLE
SOMEONE REALLY HAS BEEN IN MY ROOM WITHOUT PERMISSION K
NODDED AND QUIETLY CURSED KAMINER WHO WORKED AT HIS BANK AND WHO WAS
ALWAYS ACTIVE DOING THINGS THAT HAD NEITHER USE NOR PURPOSE
IT IS
ODD SAID MISS BRSTNER THAT I'M FORCED TO FORBID YOU TO DO SOMETHING
THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE FORBIDDEN YOURSELF TO DO NAMELY TO COME INTO MY
ROOM WHEN I'M NOT HERE BUT I DID EXPLAIN TO YOU SAID K AND WENT
OVER TO JOIN HER BY THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT IT WASN'T ME WHO INTERFERED
WITH YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS BUT AS YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME I'LL HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE BROUGHT ALONG THREE BANK EMPLOYEES WITH
THEM ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE TOUCHED YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS AND AS SOON AS I
GET THE CHANCE I'LL ASK TO HAVE HIM DISMISSED FROM THE BANK
YES THERE
WAS AN INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE HERE ADDED K AS THE YOUNG LADY WAS
LOOKING AT HIM ENQUIRINGLY
BECAUSE OF YOU SHE ASKED
YES
ANSWERED K
NO THE LADY CRIED WITH A LAUGH
YES THEY WERE SAID
K YOU BELIEVE THAT I'M INNOCENT THEN DO YOU WELL NOW INNOCENT
SAID THE LADY I DON'T WANT TO START MAKING ANY PRONOUNCEMENTS
THAT MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES I DON'T REALLY KNOW YOU AFTER ALL
IT MEANS THEY'RE DEALING WITH A SERIOUS CRIMINAL IF THEY SEND AN
INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE STRAIGHT OUT TO GET HIM
BUT YOU'RE NOT IN
CUSTODY NOW AT LEAST I TAKE IT YOU'VE NOT ESCAPED FROM PRISON
CONSIDERING THAT YOU SEEM QUITE CALM SO YOU CAN'T HAVE COMMITTED ANY
CRIME OF THAT SORT YES SAID K BUT IT MIGHT BE THAT THE
INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE COULD SEE THAT I'M INNOCENT OR NOT SO GUILTY AS
HAD BEEN SUPPOSED YES THAT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY SAID MISS
BRSTNER WHO SEEMED VERY INTERESTED
LISTEN SAID K YOU DON'T
HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE IN LEGAL MATTERS NO THAT'S TRUE I DON'T
SAID MISS BRSTNER AND I'VE OFTEN REGRETTED IT AS I'D LIKE TO KNOW
EVERYTHING AND I'M VERY INTERESTED IN LEGAL MATTERS
THERE'S SOMETHING
PECULIARLY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THE LAW ISN'T THERE BUT I'LL CERTAINLY BE
PERFECTING MY KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA AS NEXT MONTH I START WORK IN A
LEGAL OFFICE THAT'S VERY GOOD SAID K THAT MEANS YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO GIVE ME SOME HELP WITH MY TRIAL THAT COULD WELL BE SAID MISS
BRSTNER WHY NOT I LIKE TO MAKE USE OF WHAT I KNOW I MEAN IT
QUITE SERIOUSLY SAID K OR AT LEAST HALF SERIOUSLY AS YOU DO
THIS AFFAIR IS TOO PETTY TO CALL IN A LAWYER BUT I COULD MAKE GOOD USE
OF SOMEONE WHO COULD GIVE ME ADVICE YES BUT IF I'M TO GIVE YOU
ADVICE I'LL HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT SAID MISS BRSTNER
THAT'S EXACTLY THE PROBLEM SAID K I DON'T KNOW THAT MYSELF SO
YOU HAVE BEEN MAKING FUN OF ME THEN SAID MISS BRSTNER EXCEEDINGLY
DISAPPOINTED YOU REALLY OUGHT NOT TO TRY SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON AT
THIS TIME OF NIGHT AND SHE STEPPED AWAY FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHS WHERE
THEY HAD STOOD SO LONG TOGETHER
MISS BRSTNER NO SAID K I'M NOT
MAKING FUN OF YOU
PLEASE BELIEVE ME I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
I KNOW
MORE THAN I KNOW IN FACT AS IT ACTUALLY WASN'T EVEN AN
INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE THAT'S JUST WHAT I CALLED THEM BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO CALL THEM
THERE WAS NO CROSS QUESTIONING AT ALL I
WAS MERELY ARRESTED BUT BY A COMMITTEE MISS BRSTNER SAT ON THE
OTTOMAN AND LAUGHED AGAIN
WHAT WAS IT LIKE THEN SHE ASKED
IT WAS
TERRIBLE SAID K ALTHOUGH HIS MIND WAS NO LONGER ON THE SUBJECT HE
HAD BECOME TOTALLY ABSORBED BY MISS BRSTNER'S GAZE WHO WAS SUPPORTING
HER CHIN ON ONE HAND THE ELBOW RESTED ON THE CUSHION OF THE OTTOMAN
AND SLOWLY STROKING HER HIP WITH THE OTHER
THAT'S TOO VAGUE SAID
MISS BRSTNER
WHAT'S TOO VAGUE ASKED K
THEN HE REMEMBERED HIMSELF
AND ASKED WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE HE WANTED
TO MOVE IN SOME WAY BUT DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE
I'M ALREADY TIRED
SAID MISS BRSTNER
YOU ARRIVED BACK SO LATE SAID K
NOW YOU'VE
STARTED TELLING ME OFF
WELL I SUPPOSE I DESERVE IT AS I SHOULDN'T HAVE
LET YOU IN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT TURNS OUT THERE WASN'T EVEN
ANY POINT OH THERE WAS A POINT YOU'LL SEE NOW HOW IMPORTANT A
POINT IT WAS SAID K
MAY I MOVE THIS TABLE AWAY FROM YOUR BEDSIDE
AND PUT IT HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING SAID MISS BRSTNER
OF COURSE YOU CAN'T IN THAT CASE I CAN'T SHOW YOU SAID K QUITE
UPSET AS IF MISS BRSTNER HAD COMMITTED SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE OFFENCE
AGAINST HIM
ALRIGHT THEN IF YOU NEED IT TO SHOW WHAT YOU MEAN JUST
TAKE THE BEDSIDE TABLE THEN SAID MISS BRSTNER AND AFTER A SHORT
PAUSE ADDED IN A WEAK VOICE I'M SO TIRED I'M ALLOWING MORE THAN I
OUGHT TO K
PUT THE LITTLE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND SAT
DOWN BEHIND IT
YOU HAVE TO GET A PROPER IDEA OF WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE
SITUATED IT IS VERY INTERESTING
I'M THE SUPERVISOR SITTING OVER
THERE ON THE CHEST ARE TWO POLICEMEN STANDING NEXT TO THE PHOTOGRAPHS
THERE ARE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE
HANGING ON THE HANDLE OF THE WINDOW IS A
WHITE BLOUSE I JUST MENTION THAT BY THE WAY
AND NOW IT BEGINS
AH
YES I'M FORGETTING MYSELF THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON OF ALL SO I'M
STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF THE TABLE
THE SUPERVISOR IS SITTING
EXTREMELY COMFORTABLY WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED AND HIS ARM HANGING OVER THE
BACKREST HERE LIKE SOME LAYABOUT
AND NOW IT REALLY DOES BEGIN
THE
SUPERVISOR CALLS OUT AS IF HE HAD TO WAKE ME UP IN FACT HE SHOUTS AT
ME I'M AFRAID IF I'M TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU I'LL HAVE TO SHOUT AS
WELL AND IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN MY NAME THAT HE SHOUTS OUT MISS
BRSTNER LAUGHING AS SHE LISTENED TO HIM LAID HER FOREFINGER ON HER
MOUTH SO THAT K
WOULD NOT SHOUT BUT IT WAS TOO LATE
K
WAS TOO
ENGROSSED IN HIS ROLE AND SLOWLY CALLED OUT JOSEF K
IT WAS NOT AS
LOUD AS HE HAD THREATENED BUT NONETHELESS ONCE HE HAD SUDDENLY CALLED
IT OUT THE CRY SEEMED GRADUALLY TO SPREAD ITSELF ALL ROUND THE ROOM
THERE WAS A SERIES OF LOUD CURT AND REGULAR KNOCKS AT THE DOOR OF
THE ADJOINING ROOM
MISS BRSTNER WENT PALE AND LAID HER HAND ON HER
HEART
K
WAS ESPECIALLY STARTLED AS FOR A MOMENT HE HAD BEEN QUITE
UNABLE TO THINK OF ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE EVENTS OF THAT MORNING AND
THE GIRL FOR WHOM HE WAS PERFORMING THEM
HE HAD HARDLY PULLED HIMSELF
TOGETHER WHEN HE JUMPED OVER TO MISS BRSTNER AND TOOK HER HAND
DON'T
BE AFRAID HE WHISPERED I'LL PUT EVERYTHING RIGHT
BUT WHO CAN IT
BE IT'S ONLY THE LIVING ROOM NEXT DOOR NOBODY SLEEPS IN THERE YES
THEY DO WHISPERED MISS BRSTNER INTO K 'S EAR A NEPHEW OF MRS
GRUBACH'S AN CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY HAS BEEN SLEEPING THERE SINCE
YESTERDAY
THERE'S NO OTHER ROOM FREE
I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT TOO
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SHOUT LIKE THAT YOU'VE MADE ME QUITE UPSET
THERE IS NO REASON FOR IT SAID K AND NOW AS SHE SANK BACK ONTO THE
CUSHION KISSED HER FOREHEAD
GO AWAY GO AWAY SHE SAID HURRIEDLY
SITTING BACK UP GET OUT OF HERE GO WHAT IS IT YOU WANT HE'S
LISTENING AT THE DOOR HE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING
YOU'RE CAUSING ME SO MUCH
TROUBLE I WON'T GO SAID K UNTIL YOU'VE CALMED DOWN A BIT
COME
OVER INTO THE OTHER CORNER OF THE ROOM HE WON'T BE ABLE TO HEAR US
THERE SHE LET HIM LEAD HER THERE
DON'T FORGET HE SAID ALTHOUGH
THIS MIGHT BE UNPLEASANT FOR YOU YOU'RE NOT IN ANY REAL DANGER
YOU
KNOW HOW MUCH ESTEEM MRS
GRUBACH HAS FOR ME SHE'S THE ONE WHO WILL
MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS IN THIS ESPECIALLY AS THE CAPTAIN IS HER NEPHEW
BUT SHE BELIEVES EVERYTHING I SAY WITHOUT QUESTION
WHAT'S MORE SHE
HAS BORROWED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY FROM ME AND THAT MAKES HER DEPENDENT
ON ME
I WILL CONFIRM WHATEVER YOU SAY TO EXPLAIN OUR BEING HERE
TOGETHER HOWEVER INAPPROPRIATE IT MIGHT BE AND I GUARANTEE TO MAKE
SURE THAT MRS
GRUBACH WILL NOT ONLY SAY SHE BELIEVES THE EXPLANATION IN
PUBLIC BUT WILL BELIEVE IT TRULY AND SINCERELY
YOU WILL HAVE NO NEED
TO CONSIDER ME IN ANY WAY
IF YOU WISH TO LET IT BE KNOWN THAT I HAVE
ATTACKED YOU THEN MRS
GRUBACH WILL BE INFORMED OF SUCH AND SHE WILL
BELIEVE IT WITHOUT EVEN LOSING HER TRUST IN ME THAT'S HOW MUCH RESPECT
SHE HAS FOR ME MISS BRSTNER LOOKED AT THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HER
QUIET AND A LITTLE SUNK IN ON HERSELF
WHY WOULD MRS
GRUBACH NOT
BELIEVE THAT I'VE ATTACKED YOU ADDED K
HE LOOKED AT HER HAIR IN FRONT
OF HIM PARTED BUNCHED DOWN REDDISH AND FIRMLY HELD IN PLACE
HE
THOUGHT SHE WOULD LOOK UP AT HIM BUT WITHOUT CHANGING HER MANNER SHE
SAID FORGIVE ME BUT IT WAS THE SUDDENNESS OF THE KNOCKING THAT
STARTLED ME SO MUCH NOT SO MUCH WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CAPTAIN
BEING HERE MIGHT BE
IT WAS ALL SO QUIET AFTER YOU'D SHOUTED AND THEN
THERE WAS THE KNOCKING THAT'S WAS MADE ME SO SHOCKED AND I WAS SITTING
RIGHT BY THE DOOR THE KNOCKING WAS RIGHT NEXT TO ME
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR SUGGESTIONS BUT I WON'T ACCEPT THEM
I CAN BEAR THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN MY ROOM MYSELF AND I CAN DO
SO WITH ANYONE
I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T REALISE JUST HOW INSULTING YOUR
SUGGESTIONS ARE AND WHAT THEY IMPLY ABOUT ME ALTHOUGH I CERTAINLY
ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR GOOD INTENTIONS
BUT NOW PLEASE GO LEAVE ME ALONE I
NEED YOU TO GO NOW EVEN MORE THAN I DID EARLIER
THE COUPLE OF MINUTES
YOU ASKED FOR HAVE GROWN INTO HALF AN HOUR MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR NOW
K
TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND AND THEN OF HER WRIST YOU'RE NOT CROSS WITH
ME THOUGH HE SAID
SHE PULLED HER HAND AWAY AND ANSWERED NO NO
I'M NEVER CROSS WITH ANYONE HE GRASPED HER WRIST ONCE MORE SHE
TOLERATED IT NOW AND IN THAT WAY LEAD HIM TO THE DOOR
HE HAD FULLY
INTENDED TO LEAVE
BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE DOOR HE CAME TO A HALT AS IF
HE HADN'T EXPECTED TO FIND A DOOR THERE MISS BRSTNER MADE USE OF THAT
MOMENT TO GET HERSELF FREE OPEN THE DOOR SLIP OUT INTO THE HALLWAY AND
GENTLY SAY TO K
FROM THERE NOW COME ALONG PLEASE
LOOK SHE
POINTED TO THE CAPTAIN'S DOOR FROM UNDER WHICH THERE WAS A LIGHT
SHINING HE'S PUT A LIGHT ON AND HE'S LAUGHING AT US ALRIGHT I'M
COMING SAID K MOVED FORWARD TOOK HOLD OF HER KISSED HER ON THE
MOUTH AND THEN OVER HER WHOLE FACE LIKE A THIRSTY ANIMAL LAPPING WITH
ITS TONGUE WHEN IT EVENTUALLY FINDS WATER
HE FINALLY KISSED HER ON HER
NECK AND HER THROAT AND LEFT HIS LIPS PRESSED THERE FOR A LONG TIME
HE
DID NOT LOOK UP UNTIL THERE WAS A NOISE FROM THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM
I'LL
GO NOW HE SAID HE WANTED TO ADDRESS MISS BRSTNER BY HER CHRISTIAN
NAME BUT DID NOT KNOW IT
SHE GAVE HIM A TIRED NOD OFFERED HIM HER
HAND TO KISS AS SHE TURNED AWAY AS IF SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SHE WAS
DOING AND WENT BACK INTO HER ROOM WITH HER HEAD BOWED
A SHORT WHILE
LATER K
WAS LYING IN HIS BED
HE VERY SOON WENT TO SLEEP BUT BEFORE
HE DID HE THOUGHT A LITTLE WHILE ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOUR HE WAS SATISFIED
WITH IT BUT FELT SOME SURPRISE THAT HE WAS NOT MORE SATISFIED HE WAS
SERIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT MISS BRSTNER BECAUSE OF THE CAPTAIN
CHAPTER TWO
FIRST CROSS EXAMINATION
K
WAS INFORMED BY TELEPHONE THAT THERE WOULD BE A SMALL HEARING
CONCERNING HIS CASE THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY
HE WAS MADE AWARE THAT THESE
CROSS EXAMINATIONS WOULD FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER REGULARLY PERHAPS NOT EVERY
WEEK BUT QUITE FREQUENTLY
ON THE ONE HAND IT WAS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST
TO BRING PROCEEDINGS QUICKLY TO THEIR CONCLUSION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
EVERY ASPECT OF THE EXAMINATIONS HAD TO BE CARRIED OUT THOROUGHLY
WITHOUT LASTING TOO LONG BECAUSE OF THE ASSOCIATED STRESS
FOR THESE
REASONS IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO HOLD A SERIES OF BRIEF EXAMINATIONS
FOLLOWING ON ONE AFTER ANOTHER
SUNDAY HAD BEEN CHOSEN AS THE DAY FOR
THE HEARINGS SO THAT K
WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED IN HIS PROFESSIONAL WORK
IT WAS ASSUMED THAT HE WOULD BE IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS BUT IF HE WISHED
FOR ANOTHER DATE THEN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE HE WOULD BE ACCOMMODATED
CROSS EXAMINATIONS COULD EVEN BE HELD IN THE NIGHT FOR INSTANCE BUT K
WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE FRESH ENOUGH AT THAT TIME
ANYWAY AS LONG AS K
MADE NO OBJECTION THE HEARING WOULD BE LEFT ON SUNDAYS
IT WAS A
MATTER OF COURSE THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO APPEAR WITHOUT FAIL THERE WAS
PROBABLY NO NEED TO POINT THIS OUT TO HIM
HE WOULD BE GIVEN THE NUMBER
OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE WAS TO PRESENT HIMSELF WHICH WAS IN A STREET
IN A SUBURB WELL AWAY FROM THE CITY CENTRE WHICH K
HAD NEVER BEEN TO
BEFORE
ONCE HE HAD RECEIVED THIS NOTICE K
HUNG UP THE RECEIVER WITHOUT
GIVING AN ANSWER HE HAD DECIDED IMMEDIATELY TO GO THERE THAT SUNDAY IT
WAS CERTAINLY NECESSARY PROCEEDINGS HAD BEGUN AND HE HAD TO FACE UP TO
IT AND THIS FIRST EXAMINATION WOULD PROBABLY ALSO BE THE LAST
HE WAS
STILL STANDING IN THOUGHT BY THE TELEPHONE WHEN HE HEARD THE VOICE OF
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR BEHIND HIM HE WANTED TO USE THE TELEPHONE BUT K
STOOD IN HIS WAY
BAD NEWS ASKED THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR CASUALLY NOT
IN ORDER TO FIND ANYTHING OUT BUT JUST TO GET K
AWAY FROM THE DEVICE
NO NO SAID K HE STEPPED TO ONE SIDE BUT DID NOT GO AWAY ENTIRELY
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR PICKED UP THE RECEIVER AND AS HE WAITED FOR HIS
CONNECTION TURNED AWAY FROM IT AND SAID TO K ONE QUESTION MR
K
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF JOINING ME ON MY SAILING BOAT
ON SUNDAY MORNING THERE'S QUITE A FEW PEOPLE COMING YOU'RE BOUND TO
KNOW SOME OF THEM
ONE OF THEM IS HASTERER THE STATE ATTORNEY
WOULD
YOU LIKE TO COME ALONG DO COME ALONG K
TRIED TO PAY ATTENTION TO
WHAT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WAS SAYING
IT WAS OF NO SMALL IMPORTANCE FOR
HIM AS THIS INVITATION FROM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH WHOM HE HAD NEVER
GOT ON VERY WELL MEANT THAT HE WAS TRYING TO IMPROVE HIS RELATIONS WITH
HIM
IT SHOWED HOW IMPORTANT K
HAD BECOME IN THE BANK AND HOW ITS
SECOND MOST IMPORTANT OFFICIAL SEEMED TO VALUE HIS FRIENDSHIP OR AT
LEAST HIS IMPARTIALITY
HE WAS ONLY SPEAKING AT THE SIDE OF THE
TELEPHONE RECEIVER WHILE HE WAITED FOR HIS CONNECTION BUT IN GIVING
THIS INVITATION THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WAS HUMBLING HIMSELF
BUT K
WOULD
HAVE TO HUMILIATE HIM A SECOND TIME AS A RESULT HE SAID THANK YOU
VERY MUCH BUT I'M AFRAID I WILL HAVE NO TIME ON SUNDAY I HAVE A
PREVIOUS OBLIGATION PITY SAID THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND TURNED TO
THE TELEPHONE CONVERSATION THAT HAD JUST BEEN CONNECTED
IT WAS NOT A
SHORT CONVERSATION BUT K REMAINED STANDING CONFUSED BY THE INSTRUMENT
ALL THE TIME IT WAS GOING ON
IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR HUNG
UP THAT HE WAS SHOCKED INTO AWARENESS AND SAID IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY
EXCUSE HIS STANDING THERE FOR NO REASON I'VE JUST RECEIVED A TELEPHONE
CALL THERE'S SOMEWHERE I NEED TO GO BUT THEY FORGOT TO TELL ME WHAT
TIME ASK THEM THEN SAID THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR
IT'S NOT THAT
IMPORTANT SAID K ALTHOUGH IN THAT WAY HIS EARLIER EXCUSE ALREADY
WEAK ENOUGH WAS MADE EVEN WEAKER
AS HE WENT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR
CONTINUED TO SPEAK ABOUT OTHER THINGS
K
FORCED HIMSELF TO ANSWER BUT
HIS THOUGHTS WERE MAINLY ABOUT THAT SUNDAY HOW IT WOULD BE BEST TO GET
THERE FOR NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS THAT WAS THE TIME THAT COURTS
ALWAYS START WORK ON WEEKDAYS
THE WEATHER WAS DULL ON SUNDAY
K
WAS VERY TIRED AS HE HAD
STAYED OUT DRINKING UNTIL LATE IN THE NIGHT CELEBRATING WITH SOME OF THE
REGULARS AND HE HAD ALMOST OVERSLEPT
HE DRESSED HURRIEDLY WITHOUT
THE TIME TO THINK AND ASSEMBLE THE VARIOUS PLANS HE HAD WORKED OUT
DURING THE WEEK
WITH NO BREAKFAST HE RUSHED TO THE SUBURB HE HAD BEEN
TOLD ABOUT
ODDLY ENOUGH ALTHOUGH HE HAD LITTLE TIME TO LOOK AROUND
HIM HE CAME ACROSS THE THREE BANK OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN HIS CASE
RABENSTEINER KULLICH AND KAMINER
THE FIRST TWO WERE TRAVELLING IN A
TRAM THAT WENT ACROSS K 'S ROUTE BUT KAMINER SAT ON THE TERRACE OF A
CAF AND LEANT CURIOUSLY OVER THE WALL AS K
CAME OVER
ALL OF THEM
SEEMED TO BE LOOKING AT HIM SURPRISED AT SEEING THEIR SUPERIOR RUNNING
IT WAS A KIND OF PRIDE THAT MADE K
WANT TO GO ON FOOT THIS WAS HIS
AFFAIR AND THE IDEA OF ANY HELP FROM STRANGERS HOWEVER SLIGHT WAS
REPULSIVE TO HIM HE ALSO WANTED TO AVOID ASKING FOR ANYONE'S HELP
BECAUSE THAT WOULD INITIATE THEM INTO THE AFFAIR EVEN IF ONLY SLIGHTLY
AND AFTER ALL HE HAD NO WISH AT ALL TO HUMILIATE HIMSELF BEFORE THE
COMMITTEE BY BEING TOO PUNCTUAL
ANYWAY NOW HE WAS RUNNING SO THAT HE
WOULD GET THERE BY NINE O'CLOCK IF AT ALL POSSIBLE EVEN THOUGH HE HAD
NO APPOINTMENT FOR THIS TIME
HE HAD THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD RECOGNISE THE BUILDING FROM A
DISTANCE BY SOME KIND OF SIGN WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THE SIGN
WOULD LOOK LIKE OR FROM SOME PARTICULAR KIND OF ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE
ENTRANCE
K
HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE BUILDING WAS IN JULIUSSTRASSE BUT
WHEN HE STOOD AT THE STREET'S ENTRANCE IT CONSISTED ON EACH SIDE OF
ALMOST NOTHING BUT MONOTONOUS GREY CONSTRUCTIONS TALL BLOCKS OF FLATS
OCCUPIED BY POOR PEOPLE
NOW ON A SUNDAY MORNING MOST OF THE WINDOWS
WERE OCCUPIED MEN IN THEIR SHIRTSLEEVES LEANT OUT SMOKING OR CAREFULLY
AND GENTLY HELD SMALL CHILDREN ON THE SILLS
OTHER WINDOWS WERE PILED
UP WITH BEDDING ABOVE WHICH THE DISHEVELLED HEAD OF A WOMAN WOULD
BRIEFLY APPEAR
PEOPLE CALLED OUT TO EACH OTHER ACROSS THE STREET ONE
OF THE CALLS PROVOKED A LOUD LAUGH ABOUT K
HIMSELF
IT WAS A LONG
STREET AND SPACED EVENLY ALONG IT WERE SMALL SHOPS BELOW STREET LEVEL
SELLING VARIOUS KINDS OF FOODSTUFFS WHICH YOU REACHED BY GOING DOWN A
FEW STEPS
WOMEN WENT IN AND OUT OF THEM OR STOOD CHATTING ON THE
STEPS
A FRUITMONGER TAKING HIS GOODS UP TO THE WINDOWS WAS JUST AS
INATTENTIVE AS K
AND NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN WITH HIS CART
JUST THEN
A GRAMOPHONE WHICH IN BETTER PARTS OF TOWN WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS WORN
OUT BEGAN TO PLAY SOME MURDEROUS TUNE
K
WENT FURTHER INTO THE STREET SLOWLY AS IF HE HAD PLENTY OF
TIME NOW OR AS IF THE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE WERE LOOKING AT HIM FROM ONE
OF THE WINDOWS AND THEREFORE KNEW THAT K
HAD FOUND HIS WAY THERE
IT
WAS SHORTLY AFTER NINE
THE BUILDING WAS QUITE FAR DOWN THE STREET IT
COVERED SO MUCH AREA IT WAS ALMOST EXTRAORDINARY AND THE GATEWAY IN
PARTICULAR WAS TALL AND LONG
IT WAS CLEARLY INTENDED FOR DELIVERY
WAGONS BELONGING TO THE VARIOUS WAREHOUSES ALL ROUND THE YARD WHICH WERE
NOW LOCKED UP AND CARRIED THE NAMES OF COMPANIES SOME OF WHICH K
KNEW
FROM HIS WORK AT THE BANK
IN CONTRAST WITH HIS USUAL HABITS HE
REMAINED STANDING A WHILE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE YARD TAKING IN ALL
THESE EXTERNAL DETAILS
NEAR HIM THERE WAS A BARE FOOTED MAN SITTING
ON A CRATE AND READING A NEWSPAPER
THERE WERE TWO LADS SWINGING ON A
HAND CART
IN FRONT OF A PUMP STOOD A WEAK YOUNG GIRL IN A BEDJACKET
WHO AS THE WATER FLOWED INTO HER CAN LOOKED AT K
THERE WAS A PIECE
OF ROPE STRETCHED BETWEEN TWO WINDOWS IN A CORNER OF THE YARD WITH SOME
WASHING HANGING ON IT TO DRY
A MAN STOOD BELOW IT CALLING OUT
INSTRUCTIONS TO DIRECT THE WORK BEING DONE
K
WENT OVER TO THE STAIRWAY TO GET TO THE ROOM WHERE THE HEARING
WAS TO TAKE PLACE BUT THEN STOOD STILL AGAIN AS BESIDES THESE STEPS HE
COULD SEE THREE OTHER STAIRWAY ENTRANCES AND THERE ALSO SEEMED TO BE A
SMALL PASSAGEWAY AT THE END OF THE YARD LEADING INTO A SECOND YARD
IT
IRRITATED HIM THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN MORE PRECISE DIRECTIONS TO THE
ROOM IT MEANT THEY WERE EITHER BEING ESPECIALLY NEGLECTFUL WITH HIM OR
ESPECIALLY INDIFFERENT AND HE DECIDED TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO THEM VERY
LOUDLY AND VERY UNAMBIGUOUSLY
IN THE END HE DECIDED TO CLIMB UP THE
STAIRS HIS THOUGHTS PLAYING ON SOMETHING THAT HE REMEMBERED THE
POLICEMAN WILLEM SAYING TO HIM THAT THE COURT IS ATTRACTED BY THE
GUILT FROM WHICH IT FOLLOWED THAT THE COURTROOM MUST BE ON THE STAIRWAY
THAT K
SELECTED BY CHANCE
AS HE WENT UP HE DISTURBED A LARGE GROUP OF CHILDREN PLAYING ON
THE STAIRS WHO LOOKED AT HIM AS HE STEPPED THROUGH THEIR ROWS
NEXT
TIME I COME HERE HE SAID TO HIMSELF I MUST EITHER BRING SWEETS WITH
ME TO MAKE THEM LIKE ME OR A STICK TO HIT THEM WITH JUST BEFORE HE
REACHED THE FIRST LANDING HE EVEN HAD TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE UNTIL A
BALL HAD FINISHED ITS MOVEMENT TWO SMALL LADS WITH SLY FACES LIKE
GROWN UP SCOUNDRELS HELD HIM BY HIS TROUSER LEGS UNTIL IT HAD IF HE
WERE TO SHAKE THEM OFF HE WOULD HAVE TO HURT THEM AND HE WAS AFRAID OF
WHAT NOISE THEY WOULD MAKE BY SHOUTING
ON THE FIRST FLOOR HIS SEARCH BEGAN FOR REAL
HE STILL FELT
UNABLE TO ASK FOR THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE AND SO HE INVENTED A
JOINER CALLED LANZ THAT NAME OCCURRED TO HIM BECAUSE THE CAPTAIN MRS
GRUBACH'S NEPHEW WAS CALLED LANZ SO THAT HE COULD ASK AT EVERY FLAT
WHETHER LANZ THE JOINER LIVED THERE AND THUS OBTAIN A CHANCE TO LOOK
INTO THE ROOMS
IT TURNED OUT THOUGH THAT THAT WAS MOSTLY POSSIBLE
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO AS ALMOST ALL THE DOORS WERE LEFT OPEN AND THE
CHILDREN RAN IN AND OUT
MOST OF THEM WERE SMALL ONE WINDOWED ROOMS
WHERE THEY ALSO DID THE COOKING
MANY WOMEN HELD BABIES IN ONE ARM AND
WORKED AT THE STOVE WITH THE OTHER
HALF GROWN GIRLS WHO SEEMED TO BE
DRESSED IN JUST THEIR PINAFORES WORKED HARDEST RUNNING TO AND FRO
IN
EVERY ROOM THE BEDS WERE STILL IN USE BY PEOPLE WHO WERE ILL OR STILL
ASLEEP OR PEOPLE STRETCHED OUT ON THEM IN THEIR CLOTHES
K
KNOCKED AT
THE FLATS WHERE THE DOORS WERE CLOSED AND ASKED WHETHER LANZ THE JOINER
LIVED THERE
IT WAS USUALLY A WOMAN WHO OPENED THE DOOR HEARD THE
ENQUIRY AND TURNED TO SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM WHO WOULD RAISE HIMSELF FROM
THE BED
THE GENTLEMAN'S ASKING IF A JOINER CALLED LANZ LIVES HERE
A JOINER CALLED LANZ HE WOULD ASK FROM THE BED THAT'S RIGHT K
WOULD SAY ALTHOUGH IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE WAS
NOT TO BE FOUND THERE AND SO HIS TASK WAS AT AN END
THERE WERE MANY
WHO THOUGHT IT MUST BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR K
TO FIND LANZ THE JOINER AND
THOUGHT LONG ABOUT IT NAMING A JOINER WHO WAS NOT CALLED LANZ OR GIVING
A NAME THAT HAD SOME VAGUE SIMILARITY WITH LANZ OR THEY ASKED
NEIGHBOURS OR ACCOMPANIED K
TO A DOOR A LONG WAY AWAY WHERE THEY
THOUGHT SOMEONE OF THAT SORT MIGHT LIVE IN THE BACK PART OF THE BUILDING
OR WHERE SOMEONE WOULD BE WHO COULD ADVISE K
BETTER THAN THEY COULD
THEMSELVES
K
EVENTUALLY HAD TO GIVE UP ASKING IF HE DID NOT WANT TO
BE LED ALL ROUND FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR IN THIS WAY
HE REGRETTED HIS
INITIAL PLAN WHICH HAD AT FIRST SEEMED SO PRACTICAL TO HIM
AS HE
REACHED THE FIFTH FLOOR HE DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE SEARCH TOOK HIS
LEAVE OF A FRIENDLY YOUNG WORKER WHO WANTED TO LEAD HIM ON STILL
FURTHER AND WENT DOWN THE STAIRS
BUT THEN THE THOUGHT OF HOW MUCH TIME
HE WAS WASTING MADE HIM CROSS HE WENT BACK AGAIN AND KNOCKED AT THE
FIRST DOOR ON THE FIFTH FLOOR
THE FIRST THING HE SAW IN THE SMALL ROOM
WAS A LARGE CLOCK ON THE WALL WHICH ALREADY SHOWED TEN O'CLOCK
IS
THERE A JOINER CALLED LANZ WHO LIVES HERE HE ASKED
PARDON SAID A
YOUNG WOMAN WITH BLACK SHINING EYES WHO WAS AT THAT MOMENT WASHING
CHILDREN'S UNDERCLOTHES IN A BUCKET
SHE POINTED HER WET HAND TOWARDS
THE OPEN DOOR OF THE ADJOINING ROOM
K
THOUGHT HE HAD STEPPED INTO A MEETING
A MEDIUM SIZED TWO
WINDOWED ROOM WAS FILLED WITH THE MOST DIVERSE CROWD OF PEOPLE NOBODY
PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE PERSON WHO HAD JUST ENTERED
CLOSE UNDER ITS
CEILING IT WAS SURROUNDED BY A GALLERY WHICH WAS ALSO FULLY OCCUPIED AND
WHERE THE PEOPLE COULD ONLY STAND BENT DOWN WITH THEIR HEADS AND THEIR
BACKS TOUCHING THE CEILING
K WHO FOUND THE AIR TOO STUFFY STEPPED
OUT AGAIN AND SAID TO THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAD PROBABLY MISUNDERSTOOD
WHAT HE HAD SAID I ASKED FOR A JOINER SOMEONE BY THE NAME OF LANZ
YES SAID THE WOMAN PLEASE GO ON IN K
WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE
FOLLOWED HER IF THE WOMAN HAD NOT GONE UP TO HIM TAKEN HOLD OF THE DOOR
HANDLE AND SAID I'LL HAVE TO CLOSE THE DOOR AFTER YOU NO ONE ELSE
WILL BE ALLOWED IN VERY SENSIBLE SAID K BUT IT'S TOO FULL
ALREADY BUT THEN HE WENT BACK IN ANYWAY
HE PASSED THROUGH BETWEEN
TWO MEN WHO WERE TALKING BESIDE THE DOOR ONE OF THEM HELD BOTH HANDS
FAR OUT IN FRONT OF HIMSELF MAKING THE MOVEMENTS OF COUNTING OUT MONEY
THE OTHER LOOKED HIM CLOSELY IN THE EYES AND SOMEONE TOOK HIM BY THE
HAND
IT WAS A SMALL RED FACED YOUTH
COME IN COME IN HE SAID
K
LET HIMSELF BE LED BY HIM AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THERE WAS
SURPRISINGLY IN A DENSELY PACKED CROWD OF PEOPLE MOVING TO AND FRO A
NARROW PASSAGE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN THE DIVISION BETWEEN TWO FACTIONS
THIS IDEA WAS REINFORCED BY THE FACT THAT IN THE FIRST FEW ROWS TO THE
LEFT AND THE RIGHT OF HIM THERE WAS HARDLY ANY FACE LOOKING IN HIS
DIRECTION HE SAW NOTHING BUT THE BACKS OF PEOPLE DIRECTING THEIR SPEECH
AND THEIR MOVEMENTS ONLY TOWARDS MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN SIDE
MOST OF
THEM WERE DRESSED IN BLACK IN OLD LONG FORMAL FROCK COATS THAT HUNG
DOWN LOOSELY AROUND THEM
THESE CLOTHES WERE THE ONLY THING THAT
PUZZLED K AS HE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TAKEN THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY FOR A
LOCAL POLITICAL MEETING
AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL WHERE K
HAD BEEN LED THERE WAS A
LITTLE TABLE SET AT AN ANGLE ON A VERY LOW PODIUM WHICH WAS AS
OVERCROWDED AS EVERYWHERE ELSE AND BEHIND THE TABLE NEAR THE EDGE OF
THE PODIUM SAT A SMALL FAT WHEEZING MAN WHO WAS TALKING WITH SOMEONE
BEHIND HIM
THIS SECOND MAN WAS STANDING WITH HIS LEGS CROSSED AND HIS
ELBOWS ON THE BACKREST OF THE CHAIR PROVOKING MUCH LAUGHTER
FROM TIME
TO TIME HE THREW HIS ARM IN THE AIR AS IF DOING A CARICATURE OF SOMEONE
THE YOUTH WHO WAS LEADING K
HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN REPORTING TO THE
MAN
HE HAD ALREADY TRIED TWICE TO TELL HIM SOMETHING STANDING ON TIP
TOE BUT WITHOUT GETTING THE MAN'S ATTENTION AS HE SAT THERE ABOVE HIM
IT WAS ONLY WHEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE UP ON THE PODIUM DREW HIS ATTENTION
TO THE YOUTH THAT THE MAN TURNED TO HIM AND LEANT DOWN TO HEAR WHAT IT
WAS HE QUIETLY SAID
THEN HE PULLED OUT HIS WATCH AND QUICKLY LOOKED
OVER AT K
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE ONE HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES AGO
HE SAID
K
WAS GOING TO GIVE HIM A REPLY BUT HAD NO TIME TO DO SO AS
HARDLY HAD THE MAN SPOKEN THAN A GENERAL MUTTERING AROSE ALL OVER THE
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE HALL
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE ONE HOUR AND
FIVE MINUTES AGO THE MAN NOW REPEATED RAISING HIS VOICE THIS TIME
AND QUICKLY LOOKED ROUND THE HALL BENEATH HIM
THE MUTTERING ALSO
BECAME IMMEDIATELY LOUDER AND AS THE MAN SAID NOTHING MORE DIED AWAY
ONLY GRADUALLY
NOW THE HALL WAS MUCH QUIETER THAN WHEN K
HAD ENTERED
ONLY THE PEOPLE UP IN THE GALLERY HAD NOT STOPPED PASSING REMARKS
AS
FAR AS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED UP IN THE HALF DARKNESS DUST AND HAZE
THEY SEEMED TO BE LESS WELL DRESSED THAN THOSE BELOW
MANY OF THEM HAD
BROUGHT PILLOWS THAT THEY HAD PUT BETWEEN THEIR HEADS AND THE CEILING SO
THAT THEY WOULD NOT HURT THEMSELVES PRESSED AGAINST IT
K
HAD DECIDED HE WOULD DO MORE WATCHING THAN TALKING SO HE DID
NOT DEFEND HIMSELF FOR SUPPOSEDLY HAVING COME LATE AND SIMPLY SAID
WELL MAYBE I HAVE ARRIVED LATE I'M HERE NOW THERE FOLLOWED LOUD
APPLAUSE ONCE MORE FROM THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE HALL
EASY PEOPLE
TO GET ON YOUR SIDE THOUGHT K AND WAS BOTHERED ONLY BY THE QUIET FROM
THE LEFT HAND SIDE WHICH WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM AND FROM WHICH THERE
WAS APPLAUSE FROM ONLY A FEW INDIVIDUALS
HE WONDERED WHAT HE COULD SAY
TO GET ALL OF THEM TO SUPPORT HIM TOGETHER OR IF THAT WERE NOT
POSSIBLE TO AT LEAST GET THE SUPPORT OF THE OTHERS FOR A WHILE
YES SAID THE MAN BUT I'M NOW NO LONGER UNDER ANY OBLIGATION
TO HEAR YOUR CASE THERE WAS ONCE MORE A MUTTERING BUT THIS TIME IT
WAS MISLEADING AS THE MAN WAVED THE PEOPLE'S OBJECTIONS ASIDE WITH HIS
HAND AND CONTINUED I WILL HOWEVER AS AN EXCEPTION CONTINUE WITH IT
TODAY
BUT YOU SHOULD NEVER ARRIVE LATE LIKE THIS AGAIN
AND NOW STEP
FORWARD SOMEONE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE PODIUM SO THAT THERE WOULD BE A
PLACE FREE FOR K AND K
STEPPED UP ONTO IT
HE STOOD PRESSED CLOSELY
AGAINST THE TABLE THE PRESS OF THE CROWD BEHIND HIM WAS SO GREAT THAT
HE HAD TO PRESS BACK AGAINST IT IF HE DID NOT WANT TO PUSH THE JUDGE'S
DESK DOWN OFF THE PODIUM AND PERHAPS THE JUDGE ALONG WITH IT
THE JUDGE HOWEVER PAID NO ATTENTION TO THAT BUT SAT VERY
COMFORTABLY ON HIS CHAIR AND AFTER SAYING A FEW WORDS TO CLOSE HIS
DISCUSSION WITH THE MAN BEHIND HIM REACHED FOR A LITTLE NOTE BOOK THE
ONLY ITEM ON HIS DESK
IT WAS LIKE AN OLD SCHOOL EXERCISE BOOK AND HAD
BECOME QUITE MISSHAPEN FROM MUCH THUMBING
NOW THEN SAID THE JUDGE
THUMBING THROUGH THE BOOK
HE TURNED TO K
WITH THE TONE OF SOMEONE WHO
KNOWS HIS FACTS AND SAID YOU ARE A HOUSE PAINTER NO SAID K I
AM THE CHIEF CLERK IN A LARGE BANK THIS REPLY WAS FOLLOWED BY
LAUGHTER AMONG THE RIGHT HAND FACTION DOWN IN THE HALL IT WAS SO HEARTY
THAT K
COULDN'T STOP HIMSELF JOINING IN WITH IT
THE PEOPLE SUPPORTED
THEMSELVES WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR KNEES AND SHOOK AS IF SUFFERING A
SERIOUS ATTACK OF COUGHING
EVEN SOME OF THOSE IN THE GALLERY WERE
LAUGHING
THE JUDGE HAD BECOME QUITE CROSS BUT SEEMED TO HAVE NO POWER
OVER THOSE BELOW HIM IN THE HALL HE TRIED TO REDUCE WHAT HARM HAD BEEN
DONE IN THE GALLERY AND JUMPED UP THREATENING THEM HIS EYEBROWS UNTIL
THEN HARDLY REMARKABLE PUSHED THEMSELVES UP AND BECAME BIG BLACK AND
BUSHY OVER HIS EYES
THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE HALL WAS STILL QUIET THOUGH THE PEOPLE
STOOD THERE IN ROWS WITH THEIR FACES LOOKING TOWARDS THE PODIUM
LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID THERE THEY OBSERVED THE NOISE FROM THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE HALL WITH THE SAME QUIETNESS AND EVEN ALLOWED SOME
INDIVIDUALS FROM THEIR OWN RANKS HERE AND THERE TO GO FORWARD INTO THE
OTHER FACTION
THE PEOPLE IN THE LEFT FACTION WERE NOT ONLY FEWER IN
NUMBER THAN THE RIGHT BUT PROBABLY WERE NO MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEM
ALTHOUGH THEIR BEHAVIOUR WAS CALMER AND THAT MADE IT SEEM LIKE THEY
WERE
WHEN K
NOW BEGAN TO SPEAK HE WAS CONVINCED HE WAS DOING IT IN
THE SAME WAY AS THEM
YOUR QUESTION MY LORD AS TO WHETHER I AM A HOUSE PAINTER IN
FACT EVEN MORE THAN THAT YOU DID NOT ASK AT ALL BUT MERELY IMPOSED IT
ON ME IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE WHOLE WAY THESE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ME ARE
BEING CARRIED OUT
PERHAPS YOU WILL OBJECT THAT THERE ARE NO
PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ME
YOU WILL BE QUITE RIGHT AS THERE ARE
PROCEEDINGS ONLY IF I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE
BUT FOR THE MOMENT
I DO ACKNOWLEDGE IT OUT OF PITY FOR YOURSELVES TO A LARGE EXTENT
IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO OBSERVE ALL THIS BUSINESS WITHOUT FEELING PITY
I
DON'T SAY THINGS ARE BEING DONE WITHOUT DUE CARE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IT IS I WHO MAKE THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
K
STOPPED SPEAKING AND LOOKED DOWN INTO THE HALL
HE HAD SPOKEN
SHARPLY MORE SHARPLY THAN HE HAD INTENDED BUT HE HAD BEEN QUITE RIGHT
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REWARDED WITH SOME APPLAUSE HERE AND THERE BUT
EVERYTHING WAS QUIET THEY WERE ALL CLEARLY WAITING FOR WHAT WOULD
FOLLOW PERHAPS THE QUIETNESS WAS LAYING THE GROUND FOR AN OUTBREAK OF
ACTIVITY THAT WOULD BRING THIS WHOLE AFFAIR TO AN END
IT WAS SOMEWHAT
DISTURBING THAT JUST THEN THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL OPENED THE
YOUNG WASHERWOMAN WHO SEEMED TO HAVE FINISHED HER WORK CAME IN AND
DESPITE ALL HER CAUTION ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE
THERE
IT WAS ONLY THE JUDGE WHO GAVE K
ANY DIRECT PLEASURE AS HE
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY K 'S WORDS
UNTIL THEN HE
HAD LISTENED TO HIM STANDING AS K 'S SPEECH HAD TAKEN HIM BY SURPRISE
WHILE HE WAS DIRECTING HIS ATTENTION TO THE GALLERY
NOW IN THE PAUSE
HE SAT DOWN VERY SLOWLY AS IF HE DID NOT WANT ANYONE TO NOTICE
HE
TOOK OUT THE NOTEBOOK AGAIN PROBABLY SO THAT HE COULD GIVE THE
IMPRESSION OF BEING CALMER
THAT WON'T HELP YOU SIR CONTINUED K EVEN YOUR LITTLE BOOK
WILL ONLY CONFIRM WHAT I SAY K
WAS SATISFIED TO HEAR NOTHING BUT HIS
OWN QUIET WORDS IN THIS ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS AND HE EVEN DARED
CASUALLY TO PICK UP THE EXAMINING JUDGE'S NOTEBOOK AND TOUCHING IT ONLY
WITH THE TIPS OF HIS FINGERS AS IF IT WERE SOMETHING REVOLTING LIFTED
IT IN THE AIR HOLDING IT JUST BY ONE OF THE MIDDLE PAGES SO THAT THE
OTHERS ON EACH SIDE OF IT CLOSELY WRITTEN BLOTTED AND YELLOWING
FLAPPED DOWN
THOSE ARE THE OFFICIAL NOTES OF THE EXAMINING JUDGE HE
SAID AND LET THE NOTEBOOK FALL DOWN ONTO THE DESK
YOU CAN READ IN
YOUR BOOK AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE SIR I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THIS
CHARGE BOOK TO BE AFRAID OF EVEN THOUGH I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT AS I
WOULDN'T WANT IT IN MY HAND I CAN ONLY TOUCH IT WITH TWO FINGERS THE
JUDGE GRABBED THE NOTEBOOK FROM WHERE IT HAD FALLEN ON THE DESK WHICH
COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN A SIGN OF HIS DEEP HUMILIATION OR AT LEAST THAT IS
HOW IT MUST HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED TRIED TO TIDY IT UP A LITTLE AND HELD
IT ONCE MORE IN FRONT OF HIMSELF IN ORDER TO READ FROM IT
THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW LOOKED UP AT HIM SHOWING SUCH TENSION
ON THEIR FACES THAT HE LOOKED BACK DOWN AT THEM FOR SOME TIME
EVERY
ONE OF THEM WAS AN OLD MAN SOME OF THEM WITH WHITE BEARDS
COULD THEY
PERHAPS BE THE CRUCIAL GROUP WHO COULD TURN THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER THEY HAD SUNK INTO A STATE OF MOTIONLESSNESS WHILE K
GAVE HIS ORATION AND IT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO RAISE THEM FROM THIS
PASSIVITY EVEN WHEN THE JUDGE WAS BEING HUMILIATED
WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TO ME CONTINUED K WITH LESS OF THE VIGOUR HE HAD HAD EARLIER HE
CONTINUALLY SCANNED THE FACES IN THE FIRST ROW AND THIS GAVE HIS
ADDRESS A SOMEWHAT NERVOUS AND DISTRACTED CHARACTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TO ME IS NOT JUST AN ISOLATED CASE
IF IT WERE IT WOULD NOT BE OF MUCH
IMPORTANCE AS IT'S NOT OF MUCH IMPORTANCE TO ME BUT IT IS A SYMPTOM OF
PROCEEDINGS WHICH ARE CARRIED OUT AGAINST MANY
IT'S ON BEHALF OF THEM
THAT I STAND HERE NOW NOT FOR MYSELF ALONE
WITHOUT HAVING INTENDED IT HE HAD RAISED HIS VOICE
SOMEWHERE IN
THE HALL SOMEONE RAISED HIS HANDS AND APPLAUDED HIM SHOUTING BRAVO
WHY NOT THEN BRAVO AGAIN I SAY BRAVO SOME OF THE MEN IN THE
FIRST ROW GROPED AROUND IN THEIR BEARDS NONE OF THEM LOOKED ROUND TO
SEE WHO WAS SHOUTING
NOT EVEN K
THOUGHT HIM OF ANY IMPORTANCE BUT IT
DID RAISE HIS SPIRITS HE NO LONGER THOUGHT IT AT ALL NECESSARY THAT ALL
OF THOSE IN THE HALL SHOULD APPLAUD HIM IT WAS ENOUGH IF THE MAJORITY
OF THEM BEGAN TO THINK ABOUT THE MATTER AND IF ONLY ONE OF THEM NOW
AND THEN WAS PERSUADED
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL ORATOR SAID K
AFTER THIS
THOUGHT THAT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN I'M CAPABLE OF ANYWAY
I'M SURE THE
EXAMINING JUDGE CAN SPEAK FAR BETTER THAN I CAN IT IS PART OF HIS JOB
AFTER ALL
ALL THAT I WANT IS A PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF A PUBLIC WRONG
LISTEN TEN DAYS AGO I WAS PLACED UNDER ARREST THE ARREST ITSELF IS
SOMETHING I LAUGH ABOUT BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT
THEY CAME FOR ME
IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAS STILL IN BED
MAYBE THE ORDER HAD BEEN GIVEN
TO ARREST SOME HOUSE PAINTER THAT SEEMS POSSIBLE AFTER WHAT THE JUDGE
HAS SAID SOMEONE WHO IS AS INNOCENT AS I AM BUT IT WAS ME THEY CHOSE
THERE WERE TWO POLICE THUGS OCCUPYING THE NEXT ROOM
THEY COULD NOT
HAVE TAKEN BETTER PRECAUTIONS IF I HAD BEEN A DANGEROUS ROBBER
AND
THESE POLICEMEN WERE UNPRINCIPLED RIFF RAFF THEY TALKED AT ME TILL I
WAS SICK OF IT THEY WANTED BRIBES THEY WANTED TO TRICK ME INTO GIVING
THEM MY CLOTHES THEY WANTED MONEY SUPPOSEDLY SO THAT THEY COULD BRING
ME MY BREAKFAST AFTER THEY HAD BLATANTLY EATEN MY OWN BREAKFAST IN FRONT
OF MY EYES
AND EVEN THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH
I WAS LED IN FRONT OF THE
SUPERVISOR IN ANOTHER ROOM
THIS WAS THE ROOM OF A LADY WHO I HAVE A
LOT OF RESPECT FOR AND I WAS FORCED TO LOOK ON WHILE THE SUPERVISOR AND
THE POLICEMEN MADE QUITE A MESS OF THIS ROOM BECAUSE OF ME ALTHOUGH NOT
THROUGH ANY FAULT OF MINE
IT WAS NOT EASY TO STAY CALM BUT I MANAGED
TO DO SO AND WAS COMPLETELY CALM WHEN I ASKED THE SUPERVISOR WHY IT WAS
THAT I WAS UNDER ARREST
IF HE WERE HERE HE WOULD HAVE TO CONFIRM WHAT
I SAY
I CAN SEE HIM NOW SITTING ON THE CHAIR BELONGING TO THAT LADY I
MENTIONED A PICTURE OF DULL WITTED ARROGANCE
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE
ANSWERED WHAT HE TOLD ME GENTLEMEN WAS BASICALLY NOTHING AT ALL
PERHAPS HE REALLY DID KNOW NOTHING HE HAD PLACED ME UNDER ARREST AND
WAS SATISFIED
IN FACT HE HAD DONE MORE THAN THAT AND BROUGHT THREE
JUNIOR EMPLOYEES FROM THE BANK WHERE I WORK INTO THE LADY'S ROOM THEY
HAD MADE THEMSELVES BUSY INTERFERING WITH SOME PHOTOGRAPHS THAT BELONGED
TO THE LADY AND CAUSING A MESS
THERE WAS OF COURSE ANOTHER REASON
FOR BRINGING THESE EMPLOYEES THEY JUST LIKE MY LANDLADY AND HER MAID
WERE EXPECTED TO SPREAD THE NEWS OF MY ARREST AND DAMAGE MY PUBLIC
REPUTATION AND IN PARTICULAR TO REMOVE ME FROM MY POSITION AT THE BANK
WELL THEY DIDN'T SUCCEED IN ANY OF THAT NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST EVEN MY
LANDLADY WHO IS QUITE A SIMPLE PERSON AND I WILL GIVE YOU HERE HER
NAME IN FULL RESPECT HER NAME IS MRS
GRUBACH EVEN MRS
GRUBACH WAS
UNDERSTANDING ENOUGH TO SEE THAT AN ARREST LIKE THIS HAS NO MORE
SIGNIFICANCE THAN AN ATTACK CARRIED OUT ON THE STREET BY SOME YOUTHS WHO
ARE NOT KEPT UNDER PROPER CONTROL
I REPEAT THIS WHOLE AFFAIR HAS
CAUSED ME NOTHING BUT UNPLEASANTNESS AND TEMPORARY IRRITATION BUT COULD
IT NOT ALSO HAVE HAD SOME FAR WORSE CONSEQUENCES
K
BROKE OFF HERE AND LOOKED AT THE JUDGE WHO SAID NOTHING
AS
HE DID SO HE THOUGHT HE SAW THE JUDGE USE A MOVEMENT OF HIS EYES TO GIVE
A SIGN TO SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
K
SMILED AND SAID AND NOW THE JUDGE
RIGHT NEXT TO ME IS GIVING A SECRET SIGN TO SOMEONE AMONG YOU
THERE
SEEMS TO BE SOMEONE AMONG YOU WHO IS TAKING DIRECTIONS FROM ABOVE
I
DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE SIGN IS MEANT TO PRODUCE BOOING OR APPLAUSE BUT
I'LL RESIST TRYING TO GUESS WHAT ITS MEANING IS TOO SOON
IT REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME AND I GIVE HIS LORDSHIP THE JUDGE MY FULL AND
PUBLIC PERMISSION TO STOP GIVING SECRET SIGNS TO HIS PAID SUBORDINATE
DOWN THERE AND GIVE HIS ORDERS IN WORDS INSTEAD LET HIM JUST SAY BOO
NOW AND THEN THE NEXT TIME CLAP NOW
WHETHER IT WAS EMBARRASSMENT OR IMPATIENCE THE JUDGE ROCKED
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ON HIS SEAT
THE MAN BEHIND HIM WHOM HE HAD
BEEN TALKING WITH EARLIER LEANT FORWARD AGAIN EITHER TO GIVE HIM A FEW
GENERAL WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT OR SOME SPECIFIC PIECE OF ADVICE
BELOW
THEM IN THE HALL THE PEOPLE TALKED TO EACH OTHER QUIETLY BUT ANIMATEDLY
THE TWO FACTIONS HAD EARLIER SEEMED TO HOLD VIEWS STRONGLY OPPOSED TO
EACH OTHER BUT NOW THEY BEGAN TO INTERMINGLE A FEW INDIVIDUALS POINTED
UP AT K OTHERS POINTED AT THE JUDGE
THE AIR IN THE ROOM WAS FUGGY
AND EXTREMELY OPPRESSIVE THOSE WHO WERE STANDING FURTHEST AWAY COULD
HARDLY EVEN BE SEEN THROUGH IT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY
TROUBLESOME FOR THOSE VISITORS WHO WERE IN THE GALLERY AS THEY WERE
FORCED TO QUIETLY ASK THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE ASSEMBLY WHAT EXACTLY WAS
HAPPENING ALBEIT WITH TIMID GLANCES AT THE JUDGE
THE REPLIES THEY
RECEIVED WERE JUST AS QUIET AND GIVEN BEHIND THE PROTECTION OF A RAISED
HAND
I HAVE NEARLY FINISHED WHAT I HAVE TO SAY SAID K AND AS THERE
WAS NO BELL AVAILABLE HE STRUCK THE DESK WITH HIS FIST IN A WAY THAT
STARTLED THE JUDGE AND HIS ADVISOR AND MADE THEM LOOK UP FROM EACH
OTHER
NONE OF THIS CONCERNS ME AND I AM THEREFORE ABLE TO MAKE A CALM
ASSESSMENT OF IT AND ASSUMING THAT THIS SO CALLED COURT IS OF ANY REAL
IMPORTANCE IT WILL BE VERY MUCH TO YOUR ADVANTAGE TO LISTEN TO WHAT I
HAVE TO SAY
IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS WHAT I SAY PLEASE DON'T BOTHER TO
WRITE IT DOWN UNTIL LATER ON I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO WASTE AND I'LL
SOON BE LEAVING
THERE WAS IMMEDIATE SILENCE WHICH SHOWED HOW WELL K
WAS IN
CONTROL OF THE CROWD
THERE WERE NO SHOUTS AMONG THEM AS THERE HAD BEEN
AT THE START NO ONE EVEN APPLAUDED BUT IF THEY WEREN'T ALREADY
PERSUADED THEY SEEMED VERY CLOSE TO IT
K WAS PLEASED AT THE TENSION AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE THERE AS THEY
LISTENED TO HIM A RUSTLING ROSE FROM THE SILENCE WHICH WAS MORE
INVIGORATING THAN THE MOST ECSTATIC APPLAUSE COULD HAVE BEEN
THERE IS
NO DOUBT HE SAID QUIETLY THAT THERE IS SOME ENORMOUS ORGANISATION
DETERMINING WHAT IS SAID BY THIS COURT
IN MY CASE THIS INCLUDES MY
ARREST AND THE EXAMINATION TAKING PLACE HERE TODAY AN ORGANISATION THAT
EMPLOYS POLICEMEN WHO CAN BE BRIBED OAFISH SUPERVISORS AND JUDGES OF
WHOM NOTHING BETTER CAN BE SAID THAN THAT THEY ARE NOT AS ARROGANT AS
SOME OTHERS
THIS ORGANISATION EVEN MAINTAINS A HIGH LEVEL JUDICIARY
ALONG WITH ITS TRAIN OF COUNTLESS SERVANTS SCRIBES POLICEMEN AND ALL
THE OTHER ASSISTANCE THAT IT NEEDS PERHAPS EVEN EXECUTIONERS AND
TORTURERS I'M NOT AFRAID OF USING THOSE WORDS
AND WHAT GENTLEMEN IS
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ENORMOUS ORGANISATION ITS PURPOSE IS TO ARREST
INNOCENT PEOPLE AND WAGE POINTLESS PROSECUTIONS AGAINST THEM WHICH AS
IN MY CASE LEAD TO NO RESULT
HOW ARE WE TO AVOID THOSE IN OFFICE
BECOMING DEEPLY CORRUPT WHEN EVERYTHING IS DEVOID OF MEANING THAT IS
IMPOSSIBLE NOT EVEN THE HIGHEST JUDGE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT FOR
HIMSELF
THAT IS WHY POLICEMEN TRY TO STEAL THE CLOTHES OFF THE BACK OF
THOSE THEY ARREST THAT IS WHY SUPERVISORS BREAK INTO THE HOMES OF
PEOPLE THEY DO NOT KNOW THAT IS WHY INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE HUMILIATED IN
FRONT OF CROWDS RATHER THAN BEING GIVEN A PROPER TRIAL
THE POLICEMEN
ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE WAREHOUSES WHERE THEY PUT THE PROPERTY OF THOSE
THEY ARREST I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THESE WAREHOUSES WHERE THE HARD WON
POSSESSIONS OF PEOPLE UNDER ARREST IS LEFT TO DECAY IF THAT IS IT'S
NOT STOLEN BY THE THIEVING HANDS OF THE WAREHOUSE WORKERS
K
WAS INTERRUPTED BY A SCREECHING FROM THE FAR END OF THE HALL
HE SHADED HIS EYES TO SEE THAT FAR AS THE DULL LIGHT OF DAY MADE THE
SMOKE WHITISH AND HARD TO SEE THROUGH
IT WAS THE WASHERWOMAN WHOM K
HAD RECOGNISED AS A LIKELY SOURCE OF DISTURBANCE AS SOON AS SHE HAD
ENTERED
IT WAS HARD TO SEE NOW WHETHER IT WAS HER FAULT OR NOT
K
COULD ONLY SEE THAT A MAN HAD PULLED HER INTO A CORNER BY THE DOOR AND
WAS PRESSING HIMSELF AGAINST HER
BUT IT WAS NOT HER WHO WAS SCREAMING
BUT THE MAN HE HAD OPENED HIS MOUTH WIDE AND LOOKED UP AT THE CEILING
A SMALL CIRCLE HAD FORMED AROUND THE TWO OF THEM THE VISITORS NEAR HIM
IN THE GALLERY SEEMED DELIGHTED THAT THE SERIOUS TONE K
HAD INTRODUCED
INTO THE GATHERING HAD BEEN DISTURBED IN THIS WAY
K 'S FIRST THOUGHT
WAS TO RUN OVER THERE AND HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT EVERYONE WOULD WANT TO
BRING THINGS BACK INTO ORDER THERE OR AT LEAST TO MAKE THE PAIR LEAVE
THE ROOM BUT THE FIRST ROW OF PEOPLE IN FRONT OF HIM STAYED WERE THEY
WERE NO ONE MOVED AND NO ONE LET K
THROUGH
ON THE CONTRARY THEY
STOOD IN HIS WAY OLD MEN HELD OUT THEIR ARMS IN FRONT OF HIM AND A HAND
FROM SOMEWHERE HE DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO TURN ROUND TOOK HOLD OF
HIS COLLAR
K BY THIS TIME HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE PAIR IT SEEMED
TO HIM THAT HIS FREEDOM WAS BEING LIMITED AS IF HIS ARREST WAS BEING
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT FOR WHAT HE WAS DOING HE
JUMPED DOWN FROM THE PODIUM
NOW HE STOOD FACE TO FACE WITH THE CROWD
HAD HE JUDGED THE PEOPLE PROPERLY HAD HE PUT TOO MUCH FAITH IN THE
EFFECT OF HIS SPEECH HAD THEY BEEN PUTTING UP A PRETENCE ALL THE TIME
HE HAD BEEN SPEAKING AND NOW THAT HE COME TO THE END AND TO WHAT MUST
FOLLOW WERE THEY TIRED OF PRETENDING WHAT FACES THEY WERE ALL AROUND
HIM DARK LITTLE EYES FLICKERED HERE AND THERE CHEEKS DROOPED DOWN
LIKE ON DRUNKEN MEN THEIR LONG BEARDS WERE THIN AND STIFF IF THEY TOOK
HOLD OF THEM IT WAS MORE LIKE THEY WERE MAKING THEIR HANDS INTO CLAWS
NOT AS IF THEY WERE TAKING HOLD OF THEIR OWN BEARDS
BUT UNDERNEATH
THOSE BEARDS AND THIS WAS THE REAL DISCOVERY MADE BY K
THERE WERE
BADGES OF VARIOUS SIZES AND COLOURS SHINING ON THE COLLARS OF THEIR
COATS
AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS WEARING ONE OF
THESE BADGES
ALL OF THEM BELONGED TO THE SAME GROUP EVEN THOUGH THEY
SEEMED TO BE DIVIDED TO THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT OF HIM AND WHEN HE
SUDDENLY TURNED ROUND HE SAW THE SAME BADGE ON THE COLLAR OF THE
EXAMINING JUDGE WHO CALMLY LOOKED DOWN AT HIM WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS LAP
SO CALLED OUT K THROWING HIS ARMS IN THE AIR AS IF THIS SUDDEN
REALISATION NEEDED MORE ROOM ALL OF YOU ARE WORKING FOR THIS
ORGANISATION I SEE NOW THAT YOU ARE ALL THE VERY BUNCH OF CHEATS AND
LIARS I'VE JUST BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT YOU'VE ALL PRESSED YOURSELVES IN
HERE IN ORDER TO LISTEN IN AND SNOOP ON ME YOU GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF
HAVING FORMED INTO FACTIONS ONE OF YOU EVEN APPLAUDED ME TO TEST ME
OUT AND YOU WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO TRAP AN INNOCENT MAN WELL I HOPE
YOU HAVEN'T COME HERE FOR NOTHING I HOPE YOU'VE EITHER HAD SOME FUN
FROM SOMEONE WHO EXPECTED YOU TO DEFEND HIS INNOCENCE OR ELSE LET GO
OF ME OR I'LL HIT YOU SHOUTED K
TO A QUIVERY OLD MAN WHO HAD PRESSED
HIMSELF ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO HIM OR ELSE THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY LEARNED
SOMETHING
AND SO I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK IN YOUR TRADE HE BRISKLY TOOK
HIS HAT FROM WHERE IT LAY ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE AND SURROUNDED BY A
SILENCE CAUSED PERHAPS BY THE COMPLETENESS OF THEIR SURPRISE PUSHED HIS
WAY TO THE EXIT
HOWEVER THE EXAMINING JUDGE SEEMS TO HAVE MOVED EVEN
MORE QUICKLY THAN K AS HE WAS WAITING FOR HIM AT THE DOORWAY
ONE
MOMENT HE SAID
K
STOOD WHERE HE WAS BUT LOOKED AT THE DOOR WITH
HIS HAND ALREADY ON ITS HANDLE RATHER THAN AT THE JUDGE
I MERELY
WANTED TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION SAID THE JUDGE TO SOMETHING YOU SEEM
NOT YET TO BE AWARE OF TODAY YOU HAVE ROBBED YOURSELF OF THE
ADVANTAGES THAT A HEARING OF THIS SORT ALWAYS GIVES TO SOMEONE WHO IS
UNDER ARREST K
LAUGHED TOWARDS THE DOOR
YOU BUNCH OF LOUTS HE
CALLED YOU CAN KEEP ALL YOUR HEARINGS AS A PRESENT FROM ME THEN
OPENED THE DOOR AND HURRIED DOWN THE STEPS
BEHIND HIM THE NOISE OF
THE ASSEMBLY ROSE AS IT BECAME LIVELY ONCE MORE AND PROBABLY BEGAN TO
DISCUSS THESE EVENTS AS IF MAKING A SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THEM
CHAPTER THREE
IN THE EMPTY COURTROOM THE STUDENT THE OFFICES
EVERY DAY OVER THE FOLLOWING WEEK K
EXPECTED ANOTHER SUMMONS TO
ARRIVE HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HIS REJECTION OF ANY MORE HEARINGS HAD
BEEN TAKEN LITERALLY AND WHEN THE EXPECTED SUMMONS REALLY HAD NOT COME
BY SATURDAY EVENING HE TOOK IT TO MEAN THAT HE WAS EXPECTED WITHOUT
BEING TOLD TO APPEAR AT THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAME TIME
SO ON SUNDAY
HE SET OUT ONCE MORE IN THE SAME DIRECTION GOING WITHOUT HESITATION UP
THE STEPS AND THROUGH THE CORRIDORS SOME OF THE PEOPLE REMEMBERED HIM
AND GREETED HIM FROM THEIR DOORWAYS BUT HE NO LONGER NEEDED TO ASK
ANYONE THE WAY AND SOON ARRIVED AT THE RIGHT DOOR
IT WAS OPENED AS
SOON AS HE KNOCKED AND PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE WOMAN HE HAD SEEN
LAST TIME WHO WAS STANDING AT THE DOORWAY HE WAS ABOUT TO GO STRAIGHT
INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM WHEN SHE SAID TO HIM THERE'S NO SESSION TODAY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO SESSION HE ASKED UNABLE TO BELIEVE IT
BUT THE
WOMAN PERSUADED HIM BY OPENING THE DOOR TO THE NEXT ROOM
IT WAS INDEED
EMPTY AND LOOKED EVEN MORE DISMAL EMPTY THAN IT HAD THE PREVIOUS
SUNDAY
ON THE PODIUM STOOD THE TABLE EXACTLY AS IT HAD BEEN BEFORE
WITH A FEW BOOKS LAYING ON IT
CAN I HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE BOOKS
ASKED K NOT BECAUSE HE WAS ESPECIALLY CURIOUS BUT SO THAT HE WOULD NOT
HAVE COME FOR NOTHING
NO SAID THE WOMAN AS SHE RE CLOSED THE DOOR
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED
THOSE BOOKS BELONG TO THE EXAMINING JUDGE I
SEE SAID K AND NODDED THOSE BOOKS MUST BE LAW BOOKS AND THAT'S
HOW THIS COURT DOES THINGS NOT ONLY TO TRY PEOPLE WHO ARE INNOCENT BUT
EVEN TO TRY THEM WITHOUT LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON I EXPECT
YOU'RE RIGHT SAID THE WOMAN WHO HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT HE
MEANT
I'D BETTER GO AWAY AGAIN THEN SAID K
SHOULD I GIVE A MESSAGE TO THE EXAMINING JUDGE ASKED THE WOMAN
DO
YOU KNOW HIM THEN ASKED K
OF COURSE I KNOW HIM SAID THE WOMAN
MY HUSBAND IS THE COURT USHER IT WAS ONLY NOW THAT K
NOTICED THAT
THE ROOM WHICH BEFORE HAD HELD NOTHING BUT A WASH TUB HAD BEEN FITTED
OUT AS A LIVING ROOM
THE WOMAN SAW HOW SURPRISED HE WAS AND SAID
YES WE'RE ALLOWED TO LIVE HERE AS WE LIKE ONLY WE HAVE TO CLEAR THE
ROOM OUT WHEN THE COURT'S IN SESSION
THERE'S LOTS OF DISADVANTAGES TO
MY HUSBAND'S JOB IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE ROOM THAT SURPRISES ME SAID
K LOOKING AT HER CROSSLY IT'S YOUR BEING MARRIED THAT SHOCKS ME
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME THE COURT WAS IN
SESSION WHEN I DISTURBED WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ASKED THE WOMAN
OF
COURSE SAID K IT'S IN THE PAST NOW AND I'VE NEARLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT
IT BUT AT THE TIME IT MADE ME FURIOUS
AND NOW YOU TELL ME YOURSELF
THAT YOU ARE A MARRIED WOMAN IT WASN'T ANY DISADVANTAGE FOR YOU TO
HAVE YOUR SPEECH INTERRUPTED
THE WAY THEY TALKED ABOUT YOU AFTER YOU'D
GONE WAS REALLY BAD THAT COULD WELL BE SAID K TURNING AWAY BUT
IT DOES NOT EXCUSE YOU THERE'S NO ONE I KNOW WHO'D HOLD IT AGAINST
ME SAID THE WOMAN
HIM WHO PUT HIS ARMS AROUND ME HE'S BEEN CHASING
AFTER ME FOR A LONG TIME
I MIGHT NOT BE VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR MOST
PEOPLE BUT I AM FOR HIM
I'VE GOT NO PROTECTION FROM HIM EVEN MY
HUSBAND HAS HAD TO GET USED TO IT IF HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS JOB HE'S GOT
TO PUT UP WITH IT AS THAT MAN'S A STUDENT AND HE'LL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE
VERY POWERFUL LATER ON
HE'S ALWAYS AFTER ME HE'D ONLY JUST LEFT WHEN
YOU ARRIVED THAT FITS IN WITH EVERYTHING ELSE SAID K I'M NOT
SURPRISED DO YOU WANT TO MAKE THINGS A BIT BETTER HERE THE WOMAN
ASKED SLOWLY WATCHING HIM AS IF SHE WERE SAYING SOMETHING THAT COULD BE
AS DANGEROUS FOR K
AS FOR HERSELF
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I HEARD
YOU SPEAK I REALLY LIKED WHAT YOU SAID
MIND YOU I ONLY HEARD PART OF
IT I MISSED THE BEGINNING OF IT AND AT THE END I WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR
WITH THE STUDENT IT'S SO HORRIBLE HERE SHE SAID AFTER A PAUSE AND
TOOK HOLD OF K 'S HAND
DO YOU BELIEVE YOU REALLY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE
THINGS BETTER K
SMILED AND TWISTED HIS HAND ROUND A LITTLE IN HER
SOFT HANDS
IT'S REALLY NOT MY JOB TO MAKE THINGS BETTER HERE AS YOU
PUT IT HE SAID AND IF YOU SAID THAT TO THE EXAMINING JUDGE HE WOULD
LAUGH AT YOU OR PUNISH YOU FOR IT
I REALLY WOULD NOT HAVE BECOME
INVOLVED IN THIS MATTER IF I COULD HAVE HELPED IT AND I WOULD HAVE LOST
NO SLEEP WORRYING ABOUT HOW THIS COURT NEEDS TO BE MADE BETTER
BUT
BECAUSE I'M TOLD THAT I HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND I AM UNDER ARREST IT
FORCES ME TO TAKE SOME ACTION AND TO DO SO FOR MY OWN SAKE
HOWEVER
IF I CAN BE OF SOME SERVICE TO YOU IN THE PROCESS I WILL OF COURSE BE
GLAD TO DO SO
AND I WILL BE GLAD TO DO SO NOT ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF
CHARITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE YOU CAN BE OF SOME HELP TO ME HOW COULD I
HELP YOU THEN SAID THE WOMAN
YOU COULD FOR EXAMPLE SHOW ME THE
BOOKS ON THE TABLE THERE YES CERTAINLY THE WOMAN CRIED AND
PULLED K
ALONG BEHIND HER AS SHE RUSHED TO THEM
THE BOOKS WERE OLD
AND WELL WORN THE COVER OF ONE OF THEM HAD NEARLY BROKEN THROUGH IN ITS
MIDDLE AND IT WAS HELD TOGETHER WITH A FEW THREADS
EVERYTHING IS SO
DIRTY HERE SAID K SHAKING HIS HEAD AND BEFORE HE COULD PICK THE
BOOKS UP THE WOMAN WIPED SOME OF THE DUST OFF WITH HER APRON
K
TOOK
HOLD OF THE BOOK THAT LAY ON TOP AND THREW IT OPEN AN INDECENT PICTURE
APPEARED
A MAN AND A WOMAN SAT NAKED ON A SOFA THE BASE INTENT OF
WHOEVER DREW IT WAS EASY TO SEE BUT HE HAD BEEN SO GROSSLY LACKING IN
SKILL THAT ALL THAT ANYONE COULD REALLY MAKE OUT WERE THE MAN AND THE
WOMAN WHO DOMINATED THE PICTURE WITH THEIR BODIES SITTING IN OVERLY
UPRIGHT POSTURES THAT CREATED A FALSE PERSPECTIVE AND MADE IT DIFFICULT
FOR THEM TO APPROACH EACH OTHER
K
DIDN'T THUMB THROUGH THAT BOOK ANY
MORE BUT JUST THREW OPEN THE NEXT ONE AT ITS TITLE PAGE IT WAS A NOVEL
WITH THE TITLE WHAT GRETE SUFFERED FROM HER HUSBAND HANS
SO THIS IS
THE SORT OF LAW BOOK THEY STUDY HERE SAID K THIS IS THE SORT OF
PERSON SITTING IN JUDGEMENT OVER ME I CAN HELP YOU SAID THE WOMAN
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO COULD YOU REALLY DO THAT WITHOUT PLACING
YOURSELF IN DANGER YOU DID SAY EARLIER ON THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS WHOLLY
DEPENDENT ON HIS SUPERIORS I STILL WANT TO HELP YOU SAID THE
WOMAN COME OVER HERE WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT
DON'T SAY ANY MORE
ABOUT WHAT DANGER I'M IN I ONLY FEAR DANGER WHERE I WANT TO FEAR IT
COME OVER HERE SHE POINTED TO THE PODIUM AND INVITED HIM TO SIT DOWN
ON THE STEP WITH HER
YOU'VE GOT LOVELY DARK EYES SHE SAID AFTER
THEY HAD SAT DOWN LOOKING UP INTO K 'S FACE PEOPLE SAY I'VE GOT NICE
EYES TOO BUT YOURS ARE MUCH NICER
IT WAS THE FIRST THING I NOTICED
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE
THAT'S EVEN WHY I CAME IN HERE INTO THE
ASSEMBLY ROOM AFTERWARDS I'D NEVER NORMALLY DO THAT I'M NOT REALLY
EVEN ALLOWED TO SO THAT'S WHAT ALL THIS IS ABOUT THOUGHT K SHE'S
OFFERING HERSELF TO ME SHE'S AS DEGENERATE AS EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND
HERE SHE'S HAD ENOUGH OF THE COURT OFFICIALS WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE I
SUPPOSE AND SO SHE APPROACHES ANY STRANGER AND MAKES COMPLIMENTS ABOUT
HIS EYES
WITH THAT K
STOOD UP IN SILENCE AS IF HE HAD SPOKEN HIS
THOUGHTS OUT LOUD AND THUS EXPLAINED HIS ACTION TO THE WOMAN
I DON'T
THINK YOU CAN BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE TO ME HE SAID TO BE OF ANY REAL
ASSISTANCE YOU WOULD NEED TO BE IN CONTACT WITH HIGH OFFICIALS
BUT I'M
SURE YOU ONLY KNOW THE LOWER EMPLOYEES AND THERE ARE CROWDS OF THEM
MILLING ABOUT HERE
I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THEM AND COULD
ACHIEVE A GREAT DEAL THROUGH THEM I'VE NO DOUBT OF THAT BUT THE MOST
THAT COULD BE DONE THROUGH THEM WOULD HAVE NO BEARING AT ALL ON THE
FINAL OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL
YOU ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD LOSE SOME OF
YOUR FRIENDS AS A RESULT AND I HAVE NO WISH OF THAT
CARRY ON WITH
THESE PEOPLE IN THE SAME WAY AS YOU HAVE BEEN AS IT DOES SEEM TO ME TO
BE SOMETHING YOU CANNOT DO WITHOUT
I HAVE NO REGRETS IN SAYING THIS
AS IN RETURN FOR YOUR COMPLIMENT TO ME I ALSO FIND YOU RATHER
ATTRACTIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME AS SADLY AS YOU ARE NOW
ALTHOUGH YOU REALLY HAVE NO REASON TO DO SO
YOU BELONG TO THE PEOPLE I
HAVE TO COMBAT AND YOU'RE VERY COMFORTABLE AMONG THEM YOU'RE EVEN IN
LOVE WITH THE STUDENT OR IF YOU DON'T LOVE HIM YOU DO AT LEAST PREFER
HIM TO YOUR HUSBAND
IT'S EASY TO SEE THAT FROM WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
SAYING NO SHE SHOUTED REMAINED SITTING WHERE SHE WAS AND GRASPED
K 'S HAND WHICH HE FAILED TO PULL AWAY FAST ENOUGH
YOU CAN'T GO AWAY
NOW YOU CAN'T GO AWAY WHEN YOU'VE MISJUDGED ME LIKE THAT ARE YOU
REALLY CAPABLE OF GOING AWAY NOW AM I REALLY SO WORTHLESS THAT YOU
WON'T EVEN DO ME THE FAVOUR OF STAYING A LITTLE BIT LONGER YOU
MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID K SITTING BACK DOWN IF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO YOU FOR ME TO STAY HERE THEN I'LL BE GLAD TO DO SO I HAVE PLENTY OF
TIME I CAME HERE THINKING THERE WOULD BE A TRIAL TAKING PLACE
ALL I
MEANT WITH WHAT I SAID JUST NOW WAS TO ASK YOU NOT TO DO ANYTHING ON MY
BEHALF IN THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ME
BUT EVEN THAT IS NOTHING FOR YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THERE'S NOTHING HANGING ON THE
OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL AND THAT WHATEVER THE VERDICT I WILL JUST LAUGH
AT IT
AND THAT'S EVEN PRESUPPOSING IT EVER EVEN REACHES ANY
CONCLUSION WHICH I VERY MUCH DOUBT
I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT
THE COURT OFFICIALS WILL BE TOO LAZY TOO FORGETFUL OR EVEN TO FEARFUL
EVER TO CONTINUE WITH THESE PROCEEDINGS AND THAT THEY WILL SOON BE
ABANDONED IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABANDONED ALREADY
IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE
THAT THEY WILL PRETEND TO BE CARRYING ON WITH THE TRIAL IN THE HOPE OF
RECEIVING A LARGE BRIBE ALTHOUGH I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT THAT WILL BE
QUITE IN VAIN AS I PAY BRIBES TO NO ONE
PERHAPS ONE FAVOUR YOU COULD
DO ME WOULD BE TO TELL THE EXAMINING JUDGE OR ANYONE ELSE WHO LIKES TO
SPREAD IMPORTANT NEWS THAT I WILL NEVER BE INDUCED TO PAY ANY SORT OF
BRIBE THROUGH ANY STRATAGEM OF THEIRS AND I'M SURE THEY HAVE MANY
STRATAGEMS AT THEIR DISPOSAL
THERE IS NO PROSPECT OF THAT YOU CAN
TELL THEM THAT QUITE OPENLY
AND WHAT'S MORE I EXPECT THEY HAVE
ALREADY NOTICED THEMSELVES OR EVEN IF THEY HAVEN'T THIS AFFAIR IS
REALLY NOT SO IMPORTANT TO ME AS THEY THINK
THOSE GENTLEMEN WOULD ONLY
SAVE SOME WORK FOR THEMSELVES OR AT LEAST SOME UNPLEASANTNESS FOR ME
WHICH HOWEVER I AM GLAD TO ENDURE IF I KNOW THAT EACH PIECE OF
UNPLEASANTNESS FOR ME IS A BLOW AGAINST THEM
AND I WILL MAKE QUITE
SURE IT IS A BLOW AGAINST THEM
DO YOU ACTUALLY KNOW THE JUDGE
COURSE I DO SAID THE WOMAN HE WAS THE FIRST ONE I THOUGHT OF WHEN I
OFFERED TO HELP YOU
I DIDN'T KNOW HE'S ONLY A MINOR OFFICIAL BUT IF
YOU SAY SO IT MUST BE TRUE
MIND YOU I STILL THINK THE REPORT HE GIVES
TO HIS SUPERIORS MUST HAVE SOME INFLUENCE
AND HE WRITES SO MANY
REPORTS
YOU SAY THESE OFFICIALS ARE LAZY BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT
ALL LAZY ESPECIALLY THIS EXAMINING JUDGE HE WRITES EVER SUCH A LOT
LAST SUNDAY FOR INSTANCE THAT SESSION WENT ON TILL THE EVENING
EVERYONE HAD GONE BUT THE EXAMINING JUDGE HE STAYED IN THE HALL I HAD
TO BRING HIM A LAMP IN ALL I HAD WAS A LITTLE KITCHEN LAMP BUT HE WAS
VERY SATISFIED WITH IT AND STARTED TO WRITE STRAIGHT AWAY
MEANTIME MY
HUSBAND ARRIVED HE ALWAYS HAS THE DAY OFF ON SUNDAYS WE GOT THE
FURNITURE BACK IN AND GOT OUR ROOM SORTED OUT AND THEN A FEW OF THE
NEIGHBOURS CAME WE SAT AND TALKED FOR A BIT BY A CANDLE IN SHORT WE
FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE EXAMINING JUDGE AND WENT TO BED
ALL OF A SUDDEN
IN THE NIGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE LATE IN THE NIGHT I WAKES UP
NEXT TO THE BED THERE'S THE EXAMINING JUDGE SHADING THE LAMP WITH HIS
HAND SO THAT THERE'S NO LIGHT FROM IT FALLS ON MY HUSBAND HE DIDN'T
NEED TO BE AS CAREFUL AS THAT THE WAY MY HUSBAND SLEEPS THE LIGHT
WOULDN'T HAVE WOKEN HIM UP ANYWAY
I WAS QUITE SHOCKED AND NEARLY
SCREAMED BUT THE JUDGE WAS VERY FRIENDLY WARNED ME I SHOULD BE
CAREFUL HE WHISPERED TO ME HE'S BEEN WRITING ALL THIS TIME AND NOW
HE'S BROUGHT ME THE LAMP BACK AND HE'LL NEVER FORGET HOW I LOOKED WHEN
HE FOUND ME THERE ASLEEP
WHAT I MEAN WITH ALL THIS I JUST WANTED TO
TELL YOU HOW THE EXAMINING JUDGE REALLY DOES WRITE LOTS OF REPORTS
ESPECIALLY ABOUT YOU AS QUESTIONING YOU WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE MAIN
THINGS ON THE AGENDA THAT SUNDAY
IF HE WRITES REPORTS AS LONG AS THAT
THEY MUST BE OF SOME IMPORTANCE
AND BESIDES ALL THAT YOU CAN SEE
FROM WHAT HAPPENED THAT THE EXAMINING JUDGE IS AFTER ME AND IT'S RIGHT
NOW WHEN HE'S FIRST BEGUN TO NOTICE ME THAT I CAN HAVE A LOT OF
INFLUENCE ON HIM
AND I'VE GOT OTHER PROOF I MEAN A LOT TO HIM TOO
YESTERDAY HE SENT THAT STUDENT TO ME THE ONE HE REALLY TRUSTS AND WHO
HE WORKS WITH HE SENT HIM WITH A PRESENT FOR ME SILK STOCKINGS
HE
SAID IT WAS BECAUSE I CLEAR UP IN THE COURTROOM BUT THAT'S ONLY A
PRETENCE THAT JOB'S NO MORE THAN WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO IT'S WHAT MY
HUSBAND GETS PAID FOR
NICE STOCKINGS THEY ARE LOOK SHE STRETCHED
OUT HER LEG DREW HER SKIRT UP TO HER KNEE AND LOOKED HERSELF AT THE
STOCKING THEY ARE NICE STOCKINGS BUT THEY'RE TOO GOOD FOR ME
REALLY
SHE SUDDENLY INTERRUPTED HERSELF AND LAY HER HAND ON K 'S AS IF
SHE WANTED TO CALM HIM DOWN AND WHISPERED BE QUIET BERTHOLD IS
WATCHING US K
SLOWLY LOOKED UP
IN THE DOORWAY TO THE COURTROOM
STOOD A YOUNG MAN HE WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE NOT QUITE STRAIGHT AND
HE CONTINUALLY MOVED HIS FINGER ROUND IN A SHORT THIN RED BEARD WITH
WHICH HE HOPED TO MAKE HIMSELF LOOK DIGNIFIED
K
LOOKED AT HIM WITH
SOME CURIOSITY HE WAS THE FIRST STUDENT HE HAD EVER MET OF THE
UNFAMILIAR DISCIPLINE OF JURISPRUDENCE FACE TO FACE AT LEAST A MAN WHO
WOULD EVEN MOST LIKELY ATTAIN HIGH OFFICE ONE DAY
THE STUDENT IN
CONTRAST SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF K
AT ALL HE MERELY WITHDREW HIS
FINGER FROM HIS BEARD LONG ENOUGH TO BECKON TO THE WOMAN AND WENT OVER
TO THE WINDOW THE WOMAN LEANT OVER TO K
AND WHISPERED DON'T BE CROSS
WITH ME PLEASE DON'T AND PLEASE DON'T THINK ILL OF ME EITHER I'VE GOT
TO GO TO HIM NOW TO THIS HORRIBLE MAN JUST LOOK AT HIS BENT LEGS
BUT
I'LL COME STRAIGHT BACK AND THEN I'LL GO WITH YOU IF YOU'LL TAKE ME
I'LL GO WHEREVER YOU WANT YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE WITH ME I'LL BE
HAPPY IF I CAN BE AWAY FROM HERE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE IT'D BE BEST
IF I COULD GET AWAY FROM HERE FOR GOOD SHE STROKED K 'S HAND ONCE
MORE JUMPED UP AND RAN OVER TO THE WINDOW
BEFORE HE REALISED IT K
GRASPED FOR HER HAND BUT FAILED TO CATCH IT
HE REALLY WAS ATTRACTED
TO THE WOMAN AND EVEN AFTER THINKING HARD ABOUT IT COULD FIND NO GOOD
REASON WHY HE SHOULD NOT GIVE IN TO HER ALLURE
IT BRIEFLY CROSSED HIS
MIND THAT THE WOMAN MEANT TO ENTRAP HIM ON BEHALF OF THE COURT BUT THAT
WAS AN OBJECTION HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FENDING OFF
IN WHAT WAY COULD
SHE ENTRAP HIM WAS HE NOT STILL FREE SO FREE THAT HE COULD CRUSH THE
ENTIRE COURT WHENEVER HE WANTED AS LEAST WHERE IT CONCERNED HIM COULD
HE NOT HAVE THAT MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIMSELF AND HER OFFER OF HELP
SOUNDED SINCERE AND MAYBE IT WASN'T QUITE WORTHLESS
AND MAYBE THERE
WAS NO BETTER REVENGE AGAINST THE EXAMINING JUDGE AND HIS CRONIES THAN
TO TAKE THIS WOMAN FROM HIM AND HAVE HER FOR HIMSELF
MAYBE THEN AFTER
MUCH HARD WORK WRITING DISHONEST REPORTS ABOUT K THE JUDGE WOULD GO TO
THE WOMAN'S BED LATE ONE NIGHT AND FIND IT EMPTY
AND IT WOULD BE EMPTY
BECAUSE SHE BELONGED TO K BECAUSE THIS WOMAN AT THE WINDOW THIS LUSH
SUPPLE WARM BODY IN ITS SOMBRE CLOTHES OF ROUGH HEAVY MATERIAL
BELONGED TO HIM TOTALLY TO HIM AND TO HIM ALONE
ONCE HE HAD SETTLED
HIS THOUGHTS TOWARDS THE WOMAN IN THIS WAY HE BEGAN TO FIND THE QUIET
CONVERSATION AT THE WINDOW WAS TAKING TOO LONG HE RAPPED ON THE PODIUM
WITH HIS KNUCKLES AND THEN EVEN WITH HIS FIST
THE STUDENT BRIEFLY
LOOKED AWAY FROM THE WOMAN TO GLANCE AT K
OVER HIS SHOULDER BUT DID
ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE DISTURBED IN FACT HE EVEN PRESSED HIMSELF CLOSE TO
THE WOMAN AND PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER
SHE DROPPED HER HEAD DOWN LOW AS
IF LISTENING TO HIM CAREFULLY AS SHE DID SO HE KISSED HER RIGHT ON THE
NECK HARDLY EVEN INTERRUPTING WHAT HE WAS SAYING
K
SAW THIS AS
CONFIRMATION OF THE TYRANNY THE STUDENT HELD OVER THE WOMAN AND WHICH
SHE HAD ALREADY COMPLAINED ABOUT HE STOOD UP AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE
ROOM
GLANCING SIDEWAYS AT THE STUDENT HE WONDERED WHAT WOULD BE THE
QUICKEST POSSIBLE WAY TO GET RID OF HIM AND SO IT WAS NOT UNWELCOME TO
HIM WHEN THE STUDENT CLEARLY DISTURBED BY K 'S TO ING AND FRO ING WHICH
K
HAD NOW DEVELOPED INTO A STAMPING UP AND DOWN SAID TO HIM
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY HERE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING IMPATIENT
YOU COULD HAVE GONE EARLIER NO ONE WOULD HAVE MISSED YOU
IN FACT YOU
SHOULD HAVE GONE YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS SOON AS
I GOT HERE THIS COMMENT COULD HAVE CAUSED ALL POSSIBLE RAGE TO BREAK
OUT BETWEEN THEM BUT K
ALSO BORE IN MIND THAT THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE
COURT OFFICIAL SPEAKING TO A DISFAVOURED DEFENDANT AND HE MIGHT WELL
HAVE BEEN TAKING PRIDE IN SPEAKING IN THIS WAY
K
REMAINED STANDING
QUITE CLOSE TO HIM AND SAID WITH A SMILE YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT I AM
IMPATIENT BUT THE EASIEST WAY TO SETTLE THIS IMPATIENCE WOULD BE IF YOU
LEFT US
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU'VE COME HERE TO STUDY YOU ARE A
STUDENT I HEAR I'LL BE QUITE HAPPY TO LEAVE THE ROOM TO YOU AND GO
AWAY WITH THE WOMAN
I'M SURE YOU'LL STILL HAVE A LOT OF STUDY TO DO
BEFORE YOU'RE MADE INTO A JUDGE
IT'S TRUE THAT I'M STILL NOT ALL THAT
FAMILIAR WITH YOUR BRANCH OF JURISPRUDENCE BUT I TAKE IT IT INVOLVES A
LOT MORE THAN SPEAKING ROUGHLY AND I SEE YOU HAVE NO SHAME IN DOING
THAT EXTREMELY WELL HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO MOVE ABOUT SO
FREELY SAID THE STUDENT AS IF HE WANTED TO GIVE THE WOMAN AN
EXPLANATION FOR K 'S INSULTS THAT WAS A MISTAKE
I'VE TOLD THE
EXAMINING JUDGE SO
HE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE BEEN DETAINED IN HIS ROOM
BETWEEN HEARINGS
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE
JUDGE THINKS HE'S DOING
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH SAID K THEN HE REACHED HIS HAND OUT
TOWARDS THE WOMAN AND SAID COME WITH ME SO THAT'S IT SAID THE
STUDENT OH NO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET HER AND WITH A STRENGTH YOU
WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED FROM HIM HE GLANCED TENDERLY AT HER LIFTED HER
UP ON ONE ARM AND HIS BACK BENT UNDER THE WEIGHT RAN WITH HER TO THE
DOOR
IN THIS WAY HE SHOWED UNMISTAKEABLY THAT HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT
AFRAID OF K BUT HE NONETHELESS DARED TO PROVOKE HIM STILL FURTHER BY
STROKING AND SQUEEZING THE WOMAN'S ARM WITH HIS FREE HAND
K
RAN THE
FEW STEPS UP TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD REACHED HIM AND WAS ABOUT TO TAKE
HOLD OF HIM AND IF NECESSARY THROTTLE HIM THE WOMAN SAID IT'S NO
GOOD IT'S THE EXAMINING JUDGE WHO'S SENT FOR ME I DAREN'T GO WITH YOU
THIS LITTLE BASTARD AND HERE SHE RAN HER HAND OVER THE STUDENT'S
FACE THIS LITTLE BASTARD WON'T LET ME AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SET
FREE SHOUTED K LAYING HIS HAND ON THE STUDENT'S SHOULDER WHO THEN
SNAPPED AT IT WITH HIS TEETH
NO SHOUTED THE WOMAN PUSHING K
AWAY
WITH BOTH HANDS NO NO DON'T DO THAT WHAT D'YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING
THAT'D BE THE END OF ME
LET GO OF HIM PLEASE JUST LET GO OF HIM
HE'S ONLY CARRYING OUT THE JUDGE'S ORDERS HE'S CARRYING ME TO HIM
LET HIM TAKE YOU THEN AND I WANT TO SEE NOTHING MORE OF YOU SAID K
ENRAGED BY HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND GIVING THE STUDENT A THUMP IN THE BACK
SO THAT HE BRIEFLY STUMBLED AND THEN GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT FALLEN
IMMEDIATELY JUMPED UP ALL THE HIGHER WITH HIS BURDEN
K
FOLLOWED THEM
SLOWLY
HE REALISED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST UNAMBIGUOUS SETBACK HE HAD
SUFFERED FROM THESE PEOPLE
IT WAS OF COURSE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT HE
ACCEPTED THE SETBACK ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING FOR A FIGHT
IF HE
STAYED AT HOME AND CARRIED ON WITH HIS NORMAL LIFE HE WOULD BE A
THOUSAND TIMES SUPERIOR TO THESE PEOPLE AND COULD GET ANY OF THEM OUT OF
HIS WAY JUST WITH A KICK
AND HE IMAGINED THE MOST LAUGHABLE SCENE
POSSIBLE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IF THIS CONTEMPTIBLE STUDENT THIS
INFLATED CHILD THIS KNOCK KNEED REDBEARD IF HE WERE KNEELING AT ELSA'S
BED WRINGING HIS HANDS AND BEGGING FOR FORGIVENESS
K
SO ENJOYED
IMAGINING THIS SCENE THAT HE DECIDED TO TAKE THE STUDENT ALONG TO ELSA
WITH HIM IF EVER HE SHOULD GET THE OPPORTUNITY
K
WAS CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE THE WOMAN WOULD BE TAKEN AND HE
HURRIED OVER TO THE DOOR THE STUDENT WAS NOT LIKELY TO CARRY HER
THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS ARM
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE JOURNEY WAS FAR
SHORTER
DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE FLAT THERE WAS A NARROW FLIGHT OF WOODEN
STEPS WHICH PROBABLY LED UP TO THE ATTIC THEY TURNED AS THEY WENT SO
THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO SEE WHERE THEY ENDED
THE STUDENT CARRIED
THE WOMAN UP THESE STEPS AND AFTER THE EXERTIONS OF RUNNING WITH HER HE
WAS SOON GROANING AND MOVING VERY SLOWLY
THE WOMAN WAVED DOWN AT K
AND BY RAISING AND LOWERING HER SHOULDERS SHE TRIED TO SHOW THAT SHE WAS
AN INNOCENT PARTY IN THIS ABDUCTION ALTHOUGH THE GESTURE DID NOT SHOW A
LOT OF REGRET
K
WATCHED HER WITHOUT EXPRESSION LIKE A STRANGER HE
WANTED TO SHOW NEITHER THAT HE WAS DISAPPOINTED NOR THAT HE WOULD EASILY
GET OVER HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
THE TWO OF THEM HAD DISAPPEARED BUT K
REMAINED STANDING IN THE
DOORWAY
HE HAD TO ACCEPT THAT THE WOMAN HAD NOT ONLY CHEATED HIM BUT
THAT SHE HAD ALSO LIED TO HIM WHEN SHE SAID SHE WAS BEING TAKEN TO THE
EXAMINING JUDGE
THE EXAMINING JUDGE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE SITTING AND
WAITING IN THE ATTIC
THE WOODEN STAIRS WOULD EXPLAIN NOTHING TO HIM
HOWEVER LONG HE STARED AT THEM
THEN K
NOTICED A SMALL PIECE OF PAPER
NEXT TO THEM WENT ACROSS TO IT AND READ IN A CHILDISH AND UNPRACTISED
HAND ENTRANCE TO THE COURT OFFICES
WERE THE COURT OFFICES HERE IN
THE ATTIC OF THIS TENEMENT THEN IF THAT WAS HOW THEY WERE
ACCOMMODATED IT DID NOT ATTRACT MUCH RESPECT AND IT WAS SOME COMFORT
FOR THE ACCUSED TO REALISE HOW LITTLE MONEY THIS COURT HAD AT ITS
DISPOSAL IF IT HAD TO LOCATE ITS OFFICES IN A PLACE WHERE THE TENANTS OF
THE BUILDING WHO WERE THEMSELVES AMONG THE POOREST OF PEOPLE WOULD
THROW THEIR UNNEEDED JUNK
ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT THE
OFFICIALS HAD ENOUGH MONEY BUT THAT THEY SQUANDERED IT ON THEMSELVES
RATHER THAN USE IT FOR THE COURT'S PURPOSES
GOING BY K 'S EXPERIENCE
OF THEM SO FAR THAT EVEN SEEMED PROBABLE EXCEPT THAT IF THE COURT WERE
ALLOWED TO DECAY IN THAT WAY IT WOULD NOT JUST HUMILIATE THE ACCUSED BUT
ALSO GIVE HIM MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN IF THE COURT WERE SIMPLY IN A
STATE OF POVERTY
K
ALSO NOW UNDERSTOOD THAT THE COURT WAS ASHAMED TO
SUMMON THOSE IT ACCUSED TO THE ATTIC OF THIS BUILDING FOR THE INITIAL
HEARING AND WHY IT PREFERRED TO IMPOSE UPON THEM IN THEIR OWN HOMES
WHAT A POSITION IT WAS THAT K
FOUND HIMSELF IN COMPARED WITH THE JUDGE
SITTING UP IN THE ATTIC K AT THE BANK HAD A BIG OFFICE WITH AN
ANTE ROOM AND HAD AN ENORMOUS WINDOW THROUGH WHICH HE COULD LOOK DOWN
AT THE ACTIVITY IN THE SQUARE
IT WAS TRUE THOUGH THAT HE HAD NO
SECONDARY INCOME FROM BRIBES AND FRAUD AND HE COULDN'T TELL A SERVANT
TO BRING HIM A WOMAN UP TO THE OFFICE ON HIS ARM
K HOWEVER WAS
QUITE WILLING TO DO WITHOUT SUCH THINGS IN THIS LIFE AT LEAST
K
WAS
STILL LOOKING AT THE NOTICE WHEN A MAN CAME UP THE STAIRS LOOKED
THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR INTO THE LIVING ROOM WHERE IT WAS ALSO POSSIBLE TO
SEE THE COURTROOM AND FINALLY ASKED K
WHETHER HE HAD JUST SEEN A WOMAN
THERE
YOU'RE THE COURT USHER AREN'T YOU ASKED K
THAT'S RIGHT
SAID THE MAN OH YES YOU'RE DEFENDANT K I RECOGNISE YOU NOW AS
WELL
NICE TO SEE YOU HERE AND HE OFFERED K
HIS HAND WHICH WAS FAR
FROM WHAT K
HAD EXPECTED
AND WHEN K
SAID NOTHING HE ADDED THERE'S
NO COURT SESSION PLANNED FOR TODAY THOUGH I KNOW THAT SAID K
AS
HE LOOKED AT THE USHER'S CIVILIAN COAT WHICH BESIDE ITS ORDINARY
BUTTONS DISPLAYED TWO GILDED ONES AS THE ONLY SIGN OF HIS OFFICE AND
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM AN OLD ARMY OFFICER'S COAT
I WAS
SPEAKING WITH YOUR WIFE A LITTLE WHILE AGO
SHE IS NO LONGER HERE
THE
STUDENT HAS CARRIED HER OFF TO THE EXAMINING JUDGE LISTEN TO THIS
SAID THE USHER THEY'RE ALWAYS CARRYING HER AWAY FROM ME
IT'S SUNDAY
TODAY AND IT'S NOT PART OF MY JOB TO DO ANY WORK TODAY BUT THEY SEND
ME OFF WITH SOME MESSAGE WHICH ISN'T EVEN NECESSARY JUST TO GET ME AWAY
FROM HERE
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY SEND ME OFF NOT TOO FAR AWAY SO THAT I
CAN STILL HOPE TO GET BACK ON TIME IF I REALLY HURRY
SO OFF I GO
RUNNING AS FAST AS I CAN SHOUT THE MESSAGE THROUGH THE CRACK IN THE
DOOR OF THE OFFICE I'VE BEEN SENT TO SO OUT OF BREATH THEY'LL HARDLY BE
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT RUN BACK HERE AGAIN BUT THE STUDENT'S BEEN EVEN
FASTER THAN I HAVE WELL HE'S GOT LESS FAR TO GO HE'S ONLY GOT TO RUN
DOWN THE STEPS
IF I WASN'T SO DEPENDENT ON THEM I'D HAVE SQUASHED THE
STUDENT AGAINST THE WALL HERE A LONG TIME AGO
RIGHT HERE NEXT TO THE
SIGN
I'M ALWAYS DREAMING OF DOING THAT
JUST HERE JUST ABOVE THE
FLOOR THAT'S WHERE HE'S CRUSHED ONTO THE WALL HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT
HIS FINGERS SPREAD APART HIS CROOKED LEGS TWISTED ROUND INTO A CIRCLE
AND BLOOD SQUIRTED OUT ALL AROUND HIM
IT'S ONLY EVER BEEN A DREAM SO
FAR THOUGH IS THERE NOTHING ELSE YOU DO ASKED K
WITH A SMILE
NOTHING THAT I KNOW OF SAID THE USHER
AND IT'S GOING TO GET EVEN
WORSE NOW UP TILL NOW HE'S ONLY BEEN CARRYING HER OFF FOR HIMSELF NOW
HE'S STARTED CARRYING HER OFF FOR THE JUDGE AND ALL JUST LIKE I'D
ALWAYS SAID HE WOULD DOES YOUR WIFE THEN NOT SHARE SOME OF THE
RESPONSIBILITY ASKED K
HE HAD TO FORCE HIMSELF AS HE ASKED THIS
QUESTION AS HE TOO FELT SO JEALOUS NOW
COURSE SHE DOES SAID THE
USHER IT'S MORE HER FAULT THAN THEIRS
IT WAS HER WHO ATTACHED
HERSELF TO HIM
ALL HE DID HE JUST CHASES AFTER ANY WOMAN
THERE'S
FIVE FLATS IN THIS BLOCK ALONE WHERE HE'S BEEN THROWN OUT AFTER WORKING
HIS WAY IN THERE
AND MY WIFE IS THE BEST LOOKING WOMAN IN THE WHOLE
BUILDING BUT IT'S ME WHO'S NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO DEFEND HIMSELF IF
THAT'S HOW THINGS ARE THEN THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE SAID K
WELL WHY NOT ASKED THE USHER
HE'S A COWARD THAT STUDENT IF HE
WANTS TO LAY A FINGER ON MY WIFE ALL YOU'D HAVE TO DO IS GIVE HIM SUCH A
GOOD HIDING HE'D NEVER DARE DO IT AGAIN
BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO DO
THAT AND NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO DO ME THE FAVOUR AS THEY'RE ALL AFRAID
OF HIS POWER
THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD DO IT IS A MAN LIKE YOU WHAT
HOW COULD I DO IT ASKED K
IN ASTONISHMENT
WELL YOU'RE FACING A CHARGE AREN'T YOU SAID THE USHER
YES BUT
THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON FOR ME TO BE AFRAID
EVEN IF HE HAS NO
INFLUENCE ON THE OUTCOME OF THE TRIAL HE PROBABLY HAS SOME ON THE
INITIAL EXAMINATION YES EXACTLY SAID THE USHER AS IF K 'S VIEW
HAD BEEN JUST AS CORRECT AS HIS OWN
ONLY WE DON'T USUALLY GET ANY
TRIALS HEARD HERE WITH NO HOPE AT ALL I AM NOT OF THE SAME OPINION
SAID K ALTHOUGH THAT OUGHT NOT TO PREVENT ME FROM DEALING WITH THE
STUDENT IF THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU
SAID THE USHER OF THE COURT SOMEWHAT FORMALLY NOT REALLY SEEMING TO
BELIEVE THAT HIS HIGHEST WISH COULD BE FULFILLED
PERHAPS CONTINUED
K PERHAPS THERE ARE SOME OTHER OFFICIALS OF YOURS HERE PERHAPS ALL
OF THEM WHO WOULD DESERVE THE SAME OH YES YES SAID THE USHER AS
IF THIS WAS A MATTER OF COURSE
THEN HE LOOKED AT K
TRUSTINGLY WHICH
DESPITE ALL HIS FRIENDLINESS HE HAD NOT DONE UNTIL THEN AND ADDED
THEY'RE ALWAYS REBELLING BUT THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR HIM AS HE BROKE IT OFF BY SAYING NOW I
HAVE TO REPORT TO THE OFFICE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH ME
THERE'S NOTHING FOR ME TO DO THERE SAID K
YOU'D BE ABLE TO HAVE A LOOK AT IT
NO ONE WILL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF
YOU IS IT WORTH SEEING THEN ASKED K
HESITATINGLY ALTHOUGH HE
FELT VERY KEEN TO GO WITH HIM
WELL SAID THE USHER I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE INTERESTED IN IT ALRIGHT THEN SAID K
FINALLY I'LL COME WITH
YOU AND QUICKER THAN THE USHER HIMSELF HE RAN UP THE STEPS
AT THE ENTRANCE HE NEARLY FELL OVER AS BEHIND THE DOOR THERE WAS
ANOTHER STEP
THEY DON'T SHOW MUCH CONCERN FOR THE PUBLIC HE SAID
THEY DON'T SHOW ANY CONCERN AT ALL SAID THE USHER JUST LOOK AT THE
WAITING ROOM HERE IT CONSISTED OF A LONG CORRIDOR FROM WHICH ROUGHLY
MADE DOORS LED OUT TO THE SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS OF THE ATTIC
THERE WAS
NO DIRECT SOURCE OF LIGHT BUT IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY DARK AS MANY OF THE
DEPARTMENTS INSTEAD OF SOLID WALLS HAD JUST WOODEN BARS REACHING UP TO
THE CEILING TO SEPARATE THEM FROM THE CORRIDOR
THE LIGHT MADE ITS WAY
IN THROUGH THEM AND IT WAS ALSO POSSIBLE TO SEE INDIVIDUAL OFFICIALS
THROUGH THEM AS THEY SAT WRITING AT THEIR DESKS OR STOOD UP AT THE
WOODEN FRAMEWORKS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE ON THE CORRIDOR THROUGH THE
GAPS
THERE WERE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE IN THE CORRIDOR PROBABLY BECAUSE IT
WAS SUNDAY
THEY WERE NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE
THEY SAT EQUALLY SPACED
ON TWO ROWS OF LONG WOODEN BENCHES WHICH HAD BEEN PLACED ALONG BOTH
SIDES OF THE CORRIDOR
ALL OF THEM WERE CARELESSLY DRESSED ALTHOUGH THE
EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR FACES THEIR BEARING THE STYLE OF THEIR BEARDS AND
MANY DETAILS WHICH WERE HARD TO IDENTIFY SHOWED THAT THEY BELONGED TO
THE UPPER CLASSES
THERE WERE NO COAT HOOKS FOR THEM TO USE AND SO
THEY HAD PLACED THEIR HATS UNDER THE BENCH EACH PROBABLY HAVING
FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF THE OTHERS
WHEN THOSE WHO WERE SITTING NEAREST
THE DOOR SAW K
AND THE USHER OF THE COURT THEY STOOD UP TO GREET THEM
AND WHEN THE OTHERS SAW THAT THEY ALSO THOUGHT THEY HAD TO GREET THEM
SO THAT AS THE TWO OF THEM WENT BY ALL THE PEOPLE THERE STOOD UP
NONE
OF THEM STOOD PROPERLY UPRIGHT THEIR BACKS WERE BOWED THEIR KNEES
BENT THEY STOOD LIKE BEGGARS ON THE STREET
K
WAITED FOR THE USHER
WHO WAS FOLLOWING JUST BEHIND HIM
THEY MUST ALL BE VERY DISPIRITED
HE SAID
YES SAID THE USHER THEY ARE THE ACCUSED EVERYONE YOU SEE
HERE HAS BEEN ACCUSED REALLY SAID K
THEY'RE COLLEAGUES OF MINE
THEN AND HE TURNED TO THE NEAREST ONE A TALL THIN MAN WITH HAIR
THAT WAS NEARLY GREY
WHAT IS IT YOU ARE WAITING FOR HERE ASKED K
POLITELY BUT THE MAN WAS STARTLED AT BEING SPOKEN TO UNEXPECTEDLY
WHICH WAS ALL THE MORE PITIFUL TO SEE BECAUSE THE MAN CLEARLY HAD SOME
EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD AND ELSEWHERE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
SHOW HIS SUPERIORITY AND WOULD NOT HAVE EASILY GIVEN UP THE ADVANTAGE HE
HAD ACQUIRED
HERE THOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT ANSWER TO GIVE TO SUCH
A SIMPLE QUESTION AND LOOKED ROUND AT THE OTHERS AS IF THEY WERE UNDER
SOME OBLIGATION TO HELP HIM AND AS IF NO ONE COULD EXPECT ANY ANSWER
FROM HIM WITHOUT THIS HELP
THEN THE USHER OF THE COURT STEPPED FORWARD
TO HIM AND IN ORDER TO CALM HIM DOWN AND RAISE HIS SPIRITS SAID THE
GENTLEMAN HERE'S ONLY ASKING WHAT IT IS YOU'RE WAITING FOR
YOU CAN
GIVE HIM AN ANSWER THE VOICE OF THE USHER WAS PROBABLY FAMILIAR TO
HIM AND HAD A BETTER EFFECT THAN K 'S
I'M
I'M WAITING HE
BEGAN AND THEN CAME TO A HALT
HE HAD CLEARLY CHOSEN THIS BEGINNING SO
THAT HE COULD GIVE A PRECISE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION BUT NOW HE DIDN'T
KNOW HOW TO CONTINUE
SOME OF THE OTHERS WAITING HAD COME CLOSER AND
STOOD ROUND THE GROUP THE USHER OF THE COURT SAID TO THEM GET OUT THE
WAY KEEP THE GANGWAY FREE THEY MOVED BACK SLIGHTLY BUT NOT AS FAR
AS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SITTING BEFORE
IN THE MEANTIME THE MAN WHOM K
HAD FIRST APPROACHED HAD PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND EVEN ANSWERED HIM
WITH A SMILE
A MONTH AGO I MADE SOME APPLICATIONS FOR EVIDENCE TO BE HEARD IN MY
CASE AND I'M WAITING FOR IT TO BE SETTLED YOU CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE
GOING TO A LOT OF EFFORT SAID K
YES SAID THE MAN IT IS MY
AFFAIR AFTER ALL NOT EVERYONE THINKS THE SAME WAY AS YOU DO SAID
K
I'VE BEEN INDICTED AS WELL BUT I SWEAR ON MY SOUL THAT I'VE NEITHER
SUBMITTED EVIDENCE NOR DONE ANYTHING ELSE OF THE SORT
DO YOU REALLY
THINK THAT'S NECESSARY I DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY SAID THE MAN
ONCE MORE TOTALLY UNSURE OF HIMSELF HE CLEARLY THOUGHT K
WAS JOKING
WITH HIM AND THEREFORE PROBABLY THOUGHT IT BEST TO REPEAT HIS EARLIER
ANSWER IN ORDER TO AVOID MAKING ANY NEW MISTAKES
WITH K
LOOKING AT
HIM IMPATIENTLY HE JUST SAID AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I'VE APPLIED TO
HAVE THIS EVIDENCE HEARD PERHAPS YOU DON'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN
INDICTED ASKED K
OH PLEASE I CERTAINLY DO SAID THE MAN
STEPPING SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE BUT THERE WAS MORE ANXIETY IN HIS ANSWER
THAN BELIEF
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME THEN ASKED K AND TOOK HOLD OF
HIS ARM UNCONSCIOUSLY PROMPTED BY THE MAN'S HUMBLE DEMEANOUR AND AS IF
HE WANTED TO FORCE HIM TO BELIEVE HIM
BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO HURT THE
MAN AND HAD ONLY TAKEN HOLD OF HIM VERY LIGHTLY
NONETHELESS THE MAN
CRIED OUT AS IF K
HAD GRASPED HIM NOT WITH TWO FINGERS BUT WITH RED HOT
TONGS
SHOUTING IN THIS RIDICULOUS WAY FINALLY MADE K
TIRED OF HIM IF
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE HE WAS INDICTED THEN SO MUCH THE BETTER MAYBE HE EVEN
THOUGHT K
WAS A JUDGE
AND BEFORE LEAVING HE HELD HIM A LOT HARDER
SHOVED HIM BACK ONTO THE BENCH AND WALKED ON
THESE DEFENDANTS ARE SO
SENSITIVE MOST OF THEM SAID THE USHER OF THE COURT
ALMOST ALL OF
THOSE WHO HAD BEEN WAITING HAD NOW ASSEMBLED AROUND THE MAN WHO BY NOW
HAD STOPPED SHOUTING AND THEY SEEMED TO BE ASKING HIM LOTS OF PRECISE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INCIDENT
K
WAS APPROACHED BY A SECURITY GUARD
IDENTIFIABLE MAINLY BY HIS SWORD OF WHICH THE SCABBARD SEEMED TO BE
MADE OF ALUMINIUM
THIS GREATLY SURPRISED K AND HE REACHED OUT FOR IT
WITH HIS HAND
THE GUARD HAD COME BECAUSE OF THE SHOUTING AND ASKED
WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING
THE USHER OF THE COURT SAID A FEW WORDS TO TRY
AND CALM HIM DOWN BUT THE GUARD EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD TO LOOK INTO IT
HIMSELF SALUTED AND HURRIED ON WALKING WITH VERY SHORT STEPS
PROBABLY BECAUSE OF GOUT
K
DIDN'T CONCERN HIMSELF LONG WITH THE GUARD OR THESE PEOPLE
ESPECIALLY AS HE SAW A TURNING OFF THE CORRIDOR ABOUT HALF WAY ALONG IT
ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THERE WAS NO DOOR TO STOP HIM GOING THAT
WAY
HE ASKED THE USHER WHETHER THAT WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO THE USHER
NODDED AND THAT IS THE WAY THAT K
WENT
THE USHER REMAINED ALWAYS ONE
OR TWO STEPS BEHIND K WHICH HE FOUND IRRITATING AS IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
IT COULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS BEING DRIVEN ALONG BY SOMEONE
WHO HAD ARRESTED HIM SO HE FREQUENTLY WAITED FOR THE USHER TO CATCH UP
BUT THE USHER ALWAYS REMAINED BEHIND HIM
IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO HIS
DISCOMFORT K
FINALLY SAID NOW THAT I'VE SEEN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
HERE I'D LIKE TO GO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN EVERYTHING YET SAID THE
USHER INGENUOUSLY
I DON'T WANT TO SEE EVERYTHING SAID K WHO WAS ALSO FEELING VERY
TIRED I WANT TO GO WHAT IS THE WAY TO THE EXIT YOU HAVEN'T GOT
LOST HAVE YOU ASKED THE USHER IN AMAZEMENT YOU GO DOWN THIS WAY TO
THE CORNER THEN RIGHT DOWN THE CORRIDOR STRAIGHT AHEAD AS FAR AS THE
DOOR COME WITH ME SAID K SHOW ME THE WAY I'LL MISS IT THERE
ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS HERE IT'S THE ONLY WAY THERE IS SAID
THE USHER WHO HAD NOW STARTED TO SOUND QUITE REPROACHFUL I CAN'T GO
BACK WITH YOU AGAIN I'VE GOT TO HAND IN MY REPORT AND I'VE ALREADY
LOST A LOT OF TIME BECAUSE OF YOU AS IT IS COME WITH ME K
REPEATED NOW SOMEWHAT SHARPER AS IF HE HAD FINALLY CAUGHT THE USHER OUT
IN A LIE
DON'T SHOUT LIKE THAT WHISPERED THE USHER THERE'S
OFFICES ALL ROUND US HERE
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK BY YOURSELF
COME ON A BIT FURTHER WITH ME OR ELSE WAIT HERE TILL I'VE SORTED OUT MY
REPORT THEN I'LL BE GLAD TO GO BACK WITH YOU AGAIN NO NO SAID
K I WILL NOT WAIT AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME NOW K
HAD STILL NOT
LOOKED ROUND AT ANYTHING AT ALL IN THE ROOM WHERE HE FOUND HIMSELF AND
IT WAS ONLY WHEN ONE OF THE MANY WOODEN DOORS ALL AROUND HIM OPENED THAT
HE NOTICED IT
A YOUNG WOMAN PROBABLY SUMMONED BY THE LOUDNESS OF K 'S
VOICE ENTERED AND ASKED WHAT IS IT THE GENTLEMAN WANTS IN THE
DARKNESS BEHIND HER THERE WAS ALSO A MAN APPROACHING
K
LOOKED AT THE
USHER
HE HAD AFTER ALL SAID THAT NO ONE WOULD TAKE ANY NOTICE OF K
AND NOW THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE COMING IT ONLY NEEDED A FEW AND EVERYONE
IN THE OFFICE WOULD BECOME AWARE OF HIM AND ASKING FOR EXPLANATIONS AS
TO WHY HE WAS THERE
THE ONLY UNDERSTANDABLE AND ACCEPTABLE THING TO
SAY WAS THAT HE WAS ACCUSED OF SOMETHING AND WANTED TO KNOW THE DATE OF
HIS NEXT HEARING BUT THIS WAS AN EXPLANATION HE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE
ESPECIALLY AS IT WAS NOT TRUE HE HAD ONLY COME OUT OF CURIOSITY
OR
ELSE AN EXPLANATION EVEN LESS USABLE HE COULD SAY THAT HE WANTED TO
ASCERTAIN THAT THE COURT WAS AS REVOLTING ON THE INSIDE AS IT WAS ON THE
OUTSIDE
AND IT DID SEEM THAT HE HAD BEEN QUITE RIGHT IN THIS
SUPPOSITION HE HAD NO WISH TO INTRUDE ANY DEEPER HE WAS DISTURBED
ENOUGH BY WHAT HE HAD SEEN ALREADY HE WAS NOT IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF
MIND JUST THEN TO FACE A HIGH OFFICIAL SUCH AS MIGHT APPEAR FROM BEHIND
ANY DOOR AND HE WANTED TO GO EITHER WITH THE USHER OF THE COURT OR IF
NEEDS BE ALONE
BUT HE MUST HAVE SEEMED VERY ODD STANDING THERE IN SILENCE AND
THE YOUNG WOMAN AND THE USHER WERE INDEED LOOKING AT HIM AS IF THEY
THOUGHT HE WOULD GO THROUGH SOME MAJOR METAMORPHOSIS ANY SECOND WHICH
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MISS SEEING
AND IN THE DOORWAY STOOD THE MAN WHOM
K
HAD NOTICED IN THE BACKGROUND EARLIER HE HELD FIRMLY ON TO THE BEAM
ABOVE THE LOW DOOR SWINGING A LITTLE ON THE TIPS OF HIS FEET AS IF
BECOMING IMPATIENT AS HE WATCHED
BUT THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS THE FIRST TO
RECOGNISE THAT K 'S BEHAVIOUR WAS CAUSED BY HIS FEELING SLIGHTLY UNWELL
SHE BROUGHT A CHAIR AND ASKED
WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO SIT DOWN K
SAT DOWN IMMEDIATELY AND IN ORDER
TO KEEP HIS PLACE BETTER PUT HIS ELBOWS ON THE ARMRESTS
YOU'RE A
LITTLE BIT DIZZY AREN'T YOU SHE ASKED HIM
HER FACE WAS NOW CLOSE IN
FRONT OF HIM IT BORE THE SEVERE EXPRESSION THAT MANY YOUNG WOMEN HAVE
JUST WHEN THEY'RE IN THE BLOOM OF THEIR YOUTH
IT'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO
WORRY ABOUT SHE SAID THAT'S NOTHING UNUSUAL HERE ALMOST EVERYONE
GETS AN ATTACK LIKE THAT THE FIRST TIME THEY COME HERE
THIS IS YOUR
FIRST TIME IS IT YES IT'S NOTHING UNUSUAL THEN
THE SUN BURNS DOWN
ON THE ROOF AND THE HOT WOOD MAKES THE AIR SO THICK AND HEAVY
IT MAKES
THIS PLACE RATHER UNSUITABLE FOR OFFICES WHATEVER OTHER ADVANTAGES IT
MIGHT OFFER
BUT THE AIR IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BREATHE ON DAYS WHEN
THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESS AND THAT'S ALMOST EVERY DAY
AND WHEN YOU
THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WASHING PUT OUT TO DRY HERE AS WELL AND WE
CAN'T STOP THE TENANTS DOING THAT IT'S NOT SURPRISING YOU STARTED TO
FEEL UNWELL
BUT YOU GET USED TO THE AIR ALRIGHT IN THE END
WHEN
YOU'RE HERE FOR THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME YOU'LL HARDLY NOTICE HOW
OPPRESSIVE THE AIR IS
ARE YOU FEELING ANY BETTER NOW K
MADE NO
ANSWER HE FELT TOO EMBARRASSED AT BEING PUT AT THE MERCY OF THESE
PEOPLE BY HIS SUDDEN WEAKNESS AND LEARNING THE REASON FOR FEELING ILL
MADE HIM FEEL NOT BETTER BUT A LITTLE WORSE
THE GIRL NOTICED IT
STRAIGHT AWAY AND TO MAKE THE AIR FRESHER FOR K SHE TOOK A WINDOW
POLE THAT WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AND PUSHED OPEN A SMALL HATCH
DIRECTLY ABOVE K 'S HEAD THAT LED TO THE OUTSIDE
BUT SO MUCH SOOT FELL
IN THAT THE GIRL HAD TO IMMEDIATELY CLOSE THE HATCH AGAIN AND CLEAN THE
SOOT OFF K 'S HANDS WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AS K
WAS TOO TIRED TO DO
THAT FOR HIMSELF
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED JUST TO SIT QUIETLY WHERE HE WAS
UNTIL HE HAD ENOUGH STRENGTH TO LEAVE AND THE LESS FUSS PEOPLE MADE
ABOUT HIM THE SOONER THAT WOULD BE
BUT THEN THE GIRL SAID YOU CAN'T
STAY HERE WE'RE IN PEOPLE'S WAY HERE K
LOOKED AT HER AS IF TO
ASK WHOSE WAY THEY WERE IMPEDING
IF YOU LIKE I CAN TAKE YOU TO THE
SICK ROOM AND TURNING TO THE MAN IN THE DOORWAY SAID PLEASE HELP
ME
THE MAN IMMEDIATELY CAME OVER TO THEM BUT K
DID NOT WANT TO GO
TO THE SICK ROOM THAT WAS JUST WHAT HE WANTED TO AVOID BEING LED
FURTHER FROM PLACE TO PLACE THE FURTHER HE WENT THE MORE DIFFICULT IT
MUST BECOME
SO HE SAID I AM ABLE TO WALK NOW AND STOOD UP SHAKING
AFTER BECOMING USED TO SITTING SO COMFORTABLY
BUT THEN HE WAS UNABLE
TO STAY UPRIGHT
I CAN'T MANAGE IT HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD AND SAT
DOWN AGAIN WITH A SIGH
HE REMEMBERED THE USHER WHO DESPITE
EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEAD HIM OUT OF THERE BUT WHO SEEMED
TO HAVE GONE LONG BEFORE
K
LOOKED OUT BETWEEN THE MAN AND THE YOUNG
WOMAN WHO WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE
USHER
I THINK SAID THE MAN WHO WAS ELEGANTLY DRESSED AND WHOSE
APPEARANCE WAS MADE ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE WITH A GREY WAISTCOAT THAT HAD
TWO LONG SHARPLY TAILORED POINTS THE GENTLEMAN IS FEELING UNWELL
BECAUSE OF THE ATMOSPHERE HERE SO THE BEST THING AND WHAT HE WOULD
MOST PREFER WOULD BE NOT TO TAKE HIM TO THE SICK ROOM BUT GET HIM OUT
OF THE OFFICES ALTOGETHER THAT'S RIGHT EXCLAIMED K WITH SUCH JOY
THAT HE NEARLY INTERRUPTED WHAT THE MAN WAS SAYING I'M SURE THAT'LL
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER STRAIGHT AWAY I'M REALLY NOT THAT WEAK ALL I NEED
IS A LITTLE SUPPORT UNDER MY ARMS I WON'T CAUSE YOU MUCH TROUBLE IT'S
NOT SUCH A LONG WAY ANYWAY LEAD ME TO THE DOOR AND THEN I'LL SIT ON THE
STAIRS FOR A WHILE AND SOON RECOVER AS I DON'T SUFFER FROM ATTACKS LIKE
THIS AT ALL I'M SURPRISED AT IT MYSELF
I ALSO WORK IN AN OFFICE AND
I'M QUITE USED TO OFFICE AIR BUT HERE IT SEEMS TO BE TOO STRONG YOU'VE
SAID SO YOURSELVES
SO PLEASE BE SO KIND AS TO HELP ME ON MY WAY A
LITTLE I'M FEELING DIZZY YOU SEE AND IT'LL MAKE ME ILL IF I STAND UP
BY MYSELF AND WITH THAT HE RAISED HIS SHOULDERS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR
THE TWO OF THEM TO TAKE HIM BY THE ARMS
THE MAN HOWEVER DIDN'T FOLLOW THIS SUGGESTION BUT JUST STOOD
THERE WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS TROUSER POCKETS AND LAUGHED OUT LOUD
THERE YOU SEE HE SAID TO THE GIRL I WAS QUITE RIGHT
THE
GENTLEMAN IS ONLY UNWELL HERE AND NOT IN GENERAL THE YOUNG WOMAN
SMILED TOO BUT LIGHTLY TAPPED THE MAN'S ARM WITH THE TIPS OF HER
FINGERS AS IF HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TOO MUCH FUN WITH K
SO WHAT DO
YOU THINK THEN SAID THE MAN STILL LAUGHING I REALLY DO WANT TO
LEAD THE GENTLEMAN OUT OF HERE THAT'S ALRIGHT THEN SAID THE GIRL
BRIEFLY INCLINING HER CHARMING HEAD
DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT HIM
LAUGHING SAID THE GIRL TO K WHO HAD BECOME UNHAPPY ONCE MORE AND
STARED QUIETLY IN FRONT OF HIMSELF AS IF NEEDING NO FURTHER EXPLANATION
THIS GENTLEMAN MAY I INTRODUCE YOU THE MAN GAVE HIS PERMISSION
WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND SO THIS GENTLEMAN'S JOB IS TO GIVE OUT
INFORMATION
HE GIVES ALL THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE
WAITING AS OUR COURT AND ITS OFFICES ARE NOT VERY WELL KNOWN AMONG THE
PUBLIC HE GETS ASKED FOR QUITE A LOT
HE HAS AN ANSWER FOR EVERY
QUESTION YOU CAN TRY HIM OUT IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT
BUT THAT'S NOT HIS
ONLY DISTINCTION HIS OTHER DISTINCTION IS HIS ELEGANCE OF DRESS
WE
THAT'S TO SAY ALL OF US WHO WORK IN THE OFFICES HERE WE DECIDED THAT
THE INFORMATION GIVER WOULD HAVE TO BE ELEGANTLY DRESSED AS HE
CONTINUALLY HAS TO DEAL WITH THE LITIGANTS AND HE'S THE FIRST ONE THEY
MEET SO HE NEEDS TO GIVE A DIGNIFIED FIRST IMPRESSION
THE REST OF US
I'M AFRAID AS YOU CAN SEE JUST BY LOOKING AT ME DRESS VERY BADLY AND
OLD FASHIONED AND THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN SPENDING MUCH ON CLOTHES
ANYWAY AS WE HARDLY EVER LEAVE THE OFFICES WE EVEN SLEEP HERE
BUT
AS I SAID WE DECIDED THAT THE INFORMATION GIVER WOULD HAVE TO HAVE NICE
CLOTHES
AS THE MANAGEMENT HERE IS RATHER PECULIAR IN THIS RESPECT AND
THEY WOULD GET THEM FOR US WE HAD A COLLECTION SOME OF THE LITIGANTS
CONTRIBUTED TOO AND BOUGHT HIM THESE LOVELY CLOTHES AND SOME OTHERS
BESIDES
SO EVERYTHING WOULD BE READY FOR HIM TO GIVE A GOOD
IMPRESSION EXCEPT THAT HE SPOILS IT AGAIN BY LAUGHING AND FRIGHTENING
PEOPLE THAT'S HOW IT IS SAID THE MAN MOCKING HER BUT I DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS THAT YOU'RE EXPLAINING ALL OUR INTIMATE FACTS TO
THE GENTLEMAN OR RATHER WHY IT IS THAT YOU'RE PRESSING THEM ON HIM AS
I'M SURE HE'S NOT ALL INTERESTED
JUST LOOK AT HIM SITTING THERE IT'S
CLEAR HE'S OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN AFFAIRS K
JUST DID NOT FEEL LIKE
CONTRADICTING HIM
THE GIRL'S INTENTION MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD PERHAPS SHE
WAS UNDER INSTRUCTIONS TO DISTRACT HIM OR TO GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO
COLLECT HIMSELF BUT THE ATTEMPT HAD NOT WORKED
I HAD TO EXPLAIN TO
HIM WHY YOU WERE LAUGHING SAID THE GIRL
I SUPPOSE IT WAS
INSULTING I THINK HE WOULD FORGIVE EVEN WORSE INSULTS IF I FINALLY
TOOK HIM OUTSIDE K
SAID NOTHING DID NOT EVEN LOOK UP HE TOLERATED
THE TWO OF THEM NEGOTIATING OVER HIM LIKE AN OBJECT THAT WAS EVEN WHAT
SUITED HIM BEST
BUT SUDDENLY HE FELT THE INFORMATION GIVER'S HAND ON
ONE ARM AND THE YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND ON THE OTHER
UP YOU GET THEN
WEAKLING SAID THE INFORMATION GIVER
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH SAID
K PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AS HE SLOWLY ROSE AND PERSONALLY GUIDED THESE
UNFAMILIAR HANDS TO THE PLACES WHERE HE MOST NEEDED SUPPORT
AS THEY APPROACHED THE CORRIDOR THE GIRL SAID QUIETLY INTO K 'S EAR I
MUST SEEM TO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE INFORMATION GIVER IN
A GOOD LIGHT BUT YOU SHOULDN'T DOUBT WHAT I SAY I JUST WANT TO SAY THE
TRUTH
HE ISN'T HARD HEARTED
IT'S NOT REALLY HIS JOB TO HELP
LITIGANTS OUTSIDE IF THEY'RE UNWELL BUT HE'S DOING IT ANYWAY AS YOU CAN
SEE
I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY OF US IS HARD HEARTED PERHAPS WE'D ALL LIKE
TO BE HELPFUL BUT WORKING FOR THE COURT OFFICES IT'S EASY FOR US TO
GIVE THE IMPRESSION WE ARE HARD HEARTED AND DON'T WANT TO HELP ANYONE
IT MAKES ME QUITE SAD WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO SIT DOWN HERE A WHILE
ASKED THE INFORMATION GIVER THERE WERE ALREADY IN THE CORRIDOR AND JUST
IN FRONT OF THE DEFENDANT WHOM K
HAD SPOKEN TO EARLIER
K
FELT ALMOST
ASHAMED TO BE SEEN BY HIM EARLIER HE HAD STOOD SO UPRIGHT IN FRONT OF
HIM AND NOW HE HAD TO BE SUPPORTED BY TWO OTHERS HIS HAT WAS HELD UP BY
THE INFORMATION GIVER BALANCED ON OUTSTRETCHED FINGERS HIS HAIR WAS
DISHEVELLED AND HUNG DOWN ONTO THE SWEAT ON HIS FOREHEAD
BUT THE
DEFENDANT SEEMED TO NOTICE NOTHING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND JUST STOOD
THERE HUMBLY AS IF WANTING TO APOLOGISE TO THE INFORMATION GIVER FOR
BEING THERE
THE INFORMATION GIVER LOOKED PAST HIM
I KNOW HE SAID
THAT MY CASE CAN'T BE SETTLED TODAY NOT YET BUT I'VE COME IN ANYWAY
I THOUGHT I THOUGHT I COULD WAIT HERE ANYWAY IT'S SUNDAY TODAY I'VE
GOT PLENTY OF TIME AND I'M NOT DISTURBING ANYONE HERE THERE'S NO
NEED TO BE SO APOLOGETIC SAID THE INFORMATION GIVER IT'S VERY
COMMENDABLE FOR YOU TO BE SO ATTENTIVE
YOU ARE TAKING UP SPACE HERE
WHEN YOU DON'T NEED TO BUT AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET IN MY WAY I WILL DO
NOTHING TO STOP YOU FOLLOWING THE PROGRESS OF YOUR CASE AS CLOSELY AS
YOU LIKE
WHEN ONE HAS SEEN SO MANY PEOPLE WHO SHAMEFULLY NEGLECT THEIR
CASES ONE LEARNS TO SHOW PATIENCE WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU
DO SIT DOWN
HE'S VERY GOOD WITH THE LITIGANTS WHISPERED THE GIRL
K
NODDED BUT
STARTED TO MOVE OFF AGAIN WHEN THE INFORMATION GIVER REPEATED WOULD
YOU NOT LIKE TO SIT DOWN HERE A WHILE NO SAID K I DON'T WANT TO
REST HE HAD SAID THAT AS DECISIVELY AS HE COULD BUT IN FACT IT
WOULD HAVE DONE HIM A LOT OF GOOD TO SIT DOWN
IT WAS AS IF HE WERE
SUFFERING SEA SICKNESS
HE FELT AS IF HE WERE ON A SHIP IN A ROUGH SEA
AS IF THE WATER WERE HITTING AGAINST THE WOODEN WALLS A THUNDERING FROM
THE DEPTHS OF THE CORRIDOR AS IF THE TORRENT WERE CRASHING OVER IT AS
IF THE CORRIDOR WERE SWAYING AND THE WAITING LITIGANTS ON EACH SIDE OF
IT RISING AND SINKING
IT MADE THE CALMNESS OF THE GIRL AND THE MAN
LEADING HIM ALL THE MORE INCOMPREHENSIBLE
HE WAS AT THEIR MERCY IF
THEY LET GO OF HIM HE WOULD FALL LIKE A BOARD
THEIR LITTLE EYES
GLANCED HERE AND THERE K
COULD FEEL THE EVENNESS OF THEIR STEPS BUT
COULD NOT DO THE SAME AS FROM STEP TO STEP HE WAS VIRTUALLY BEING
CARRIED
HE FINALLY NOTICED THEY WERE SPEAKING TO HIM BUT HE DID NOT
UNDERSTAND THEM ALL HE HEARD WAS A NOISE THAT FILLED ALL THE SPACE AND
THROUGH WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE AN UNCHANGING HIGHER NOTE SOUNDING
LIKE A SIREN
LOUDER HE WHISPERED WITH HIS HEAD SUNK LOW ASHAMED AT
HAVING TO ASK THEM TO SPEAK LOUDER WHEN HE KNEW THEY HAD SPOKEN LOUDLY
ENOUGH EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN FOR HIM INCOMPREHENSIBLE
AT LAST A
DRAUGHT OF COOL AIR BLEW IN HIS FACE AS IF A GAP HAD BEEN TORN OUT IN
THE WALL IN FRONT OF HIM AND NEXT TO HIM HE HEARD SOMEONE SAY FIRST
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO GO AND THEN YOU CAN TELL HIM A HUNDRED TIMES THAT
THIS IS THE WAY OUT AND HE DOESN'T MOVE K
BECAME AWARE THAT HE WAS
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE WAY OUT AND THAT THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD OPENED
THE DOOR
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT ALL HIS STRENGTH RETURNED TO HIM AT
ONCE AND TO GET A FORETASTE OF FREEDOM HE STEPPED STRAIGHT ON TO ONE OF
THE STAIRS AND TOOK HIS LEAVE THERE OF HIS COMPANIONS WHO BOWED TO HIM
THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE REPEATED SHOOK THEIR HANDS ONCE MORE AND DID
NOT LET GO UNTIL HE THOUGHT HE SAW THAT THEY FOUND IT HARD TO BEAR THE
COMPARATIVELY FRESH AIR FROM THE STAIRWAY AFTER BEING SO LONG USED TO
THE AIR IN THE OFFICES
THEY WERE HARDLY ABLE TO REPLY AND THE YOUNG
WOMAN MIGHT EVEN HAVE FALLEN OVER IF K
HAD NOT SHUT THE DOOR EXTREMELY
FAST
K
THEN STOOD STILL FOR A WHILE COMBED HIS HAIR WITH THE HELP OF
A POCKET MIRROR PICKED UP HIS HAT FROM THE NEXT STAIR THE
INFORMATION GIVER MUST HAVE THROWN IT DOWN THERE AND THEN HE RAN DOWN
THE STEPS SO FRESH AND IN SUCH LONG LEAPS THAT THE CONTRAST WITH HIS
PREVIOUS STATE NEARLY FRIGHTENED HIM
HIS NORMALLY STURDY STATE OF
HEALTH HAD NEVER PREPARED HIM FOR SURPRISES SUCH AS THIS
DID HIS BODY
WANT TO REVOLT AND CAUSE HIM A NEW TRIAL AS HE WAS BEARING THE OLD ONE
WITH SUCH LITTLE EFFORT HE DID NOT QUITE REJECT THE IDEA THAT HE
SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR THE NEXT TIME HE HAD THE CHANCE BUT WHATEVER HE DID
AND THIS WAS SOMETHING ON WHICH HE COULD ADVISE HIMSELF HE WANTED TO
SPEND ALL SUNDAY MORNINGS IN FUTURE BETTER THAN HE HAD SPENT THIS ONE
CHAPTER FOUR
MISS BRSTNER'S FRIEND
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS K
FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE EVEN
JUST A FEW WORDS WITH MISS BRSTNER
HE TRIED TO REACH HER IN MANY AND
VARIOUS WAYS BUT SHE ALWAYS FOUND A WAY TO AVOID IT
HE WOULD COME
STRAIGHT HOME FROM THE OFFICE REMAIN IN HER ROOM WITHOUT THE LIGHT ON
AND SIT ON THE SOFA WITH NOTHING MORE TO DISTRACT HIM THAN KEEPING WATCH
ON THE EMPTY HALLWAY
IF THE MAID WENT BY AND CLOSED THE DOOR OF THE
APPARENTLY EMPTY ROOM HE WOULD GET UP AFTER A WHILE AND OPEN IT AGAIN
HE GOT UP AN HOUR EARLIER THAN USUAL IN THE MORNING SO THAT HE MIGHT
PERHAPS FIND MISS BRSTNER ALONE AS SHE WENT TO THE OFFICE
BUT NONE OF
THESE EFFORTS BROUGHT ANY SUCCESS
THEN HE WROTE HER A LETTER BOTH TO
THE OFFICE AND THE FLAT ATTEMPTING ONCE MORE TO JUSTIFY HIS BEHAVIOUR
OFFERED TO MAKE WHATEVER AMENDS HE COULD PROMISED NEVER TO CROSS
WHATEVER BOUNDARY SHE MIGHT SET HIM AND BEGGED MERELY TO HAVE THE CHANCE
TO SPEAK TO HER SOME TIME ESPECIALLY AS HE WAS UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING
WITH MRS
GRUBACH EITHER UNTIL HE HAD SPOKEN WITH MISS BRSTNER HE
FINALLY INFORMED HER THAT THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY HE WOULD STAY IN HIS ROOM
ALL DAY WAITING FOR A SIGN FROM HER THAT THERE WAS SOME HOPE OF HIS
REQUEST BEING FULFILLED OR AT LEAST THAT SHE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HIM WHY
SHE COULD NOT FULFIL IT EVEN THOUGH HE HAD PROMISED TO OBSERVE WHATEVER
STIPULATIONS SHE MIGHT MAKE
THE LETTERS WERE NOT RETURNED BUT THERE
WAS NO ANSWER EITHER
HOWEVER ON THE FOLLOWING SUNDAY THERE WAS A SIGN
THAT SEEMED CLEAR ENOUGH
IT WAS STILL EARLY WHEN K
NOTICED THROUGH
THE KEYHOLE THAT THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN THE HALLWAY
WHICH SOON ABATED
A FRENCH TEACHER ALTHOUGH SHE WAS GERMAN AND CALLED
MONTAG A PALE AND FEBRILE GIRL WITH A SLIGHT LIMP WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY
OCCUPIED A ROOM OF HER OWN WAS MOVING INTO MISS BRSTNER'S ROOM
SHE
COULD BE SEEN SHUFFLING THROUGH THE HALLWAY FOR SEVERAL HOURS THERE WAS
ALWAYS ANOTHER PIECE OF CLOTHING OR A BLANKET OR A BOOK THAT SHE HAD
FORGOTTEN AND HAD TO BE FETCHED SPECIALLY AND BROUGHT INTO THE NEW HOME
WHEN MRS
GRUBACH BROUGHT K
HIS BREAKFAST EVER SINCE THE TIME
WHEN SHE HAD MADE K
SO CROSS SHE DIDN'T TRUST THE MAID TO DO THE
SLIGHTEST JOB HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SPEAK TO HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN FIVE DAYS
WHY IS THERE SO MUCH NOISE IN THE HALLWAY TODAY HE
ASKED AS SHE POURED HIS COFFEE OUT CAN'T SOMETHING BE DONE ABOUT IT
DOES THIS CLEARING OUT HAVE TO BE DONE ON A SUNDAY K
DID NOT LOOK UP
AT MRS
GRUBACH BUT HE SAW NONETHELESS THAT SHE SEEMED TO FEEL SOME
RELIEF AS SHE BREATHED IN
EVEN SHARP QUESTIONS LIKE THIS FROM MR
K
SHE PERCEIVED AS FORGIVENESS OR AS THE BEGINNING OF FORGIVENESS
WE'RE NOT CLEARING ANYTHING OUT MR
K SHE SAID IT'S JUST THAT
MISS MONTAG IS MOVING IN WITH MISS BRSTNER AND IS MOVING HER THINGS
ACROSS SHE SAID NOTHING MORE BUT JUST WAITED TO SEE HOW K
WOULD
TAKE IT AND WHETHER HE WOULD ALLOW HER TO CARRY ON SPEAKING
BUT K
KEPT HER IN UNCERTAINTY TOOK THE SPOON AND PENSIVELY STIRRED HIS COFFEE
WHILE HE REMAINED SILENT
THEN HE LOOKED UP AT HER AND SAID WHAT
ABOUT THE SUSPICIONS YOU HAD EARLIER ABOUT MISS BRSTNER HAVE YOU GIVEN
THEM UP MR
K CALLED MRS
GRUBACH WHO HAD BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
VERY QUESTION AS SHE PUT HER HANDS TOGETHER AND HELD THEM OUT TOWARDS
HIM
I JUST MADE A CHANCE REMARK AND YOU TOOK IT SO BADLY
I DIDN'T
HAVE THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF OFFENDING ANYONE NOT YOU OR ANYONE
ELSE
YOU'VE KNOWN ME FOR LONG ENOUGH MR
K I'M SURE YOU'RE
CONVINCED OF THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I'VE BEEN SUFFERING FOR THE PAST
FEW DAYS THAT I SHOULD TELL LIES ABOUT MY TENANTS AND YOU MR
K
YOU BELIEVED IT AND SAID I SHOULD GIVE YOU NOTICE GIVE YOU NOTICE
AT THIS LAST OUTCRY MRS
GRUBACH WAS ALREADY CHOKING BACK HER TEARS
SHE RAISED HER APRON TO HER FACE AND BLUBBERED OUT LOUD
OH DON'T CRY MRS
GRUBACH SAID K LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW HE
WAS THINKING ONLY OF MISS BRSTNER AND HOW SHE WAS ACCEPTING AN UNKNOWN
GIRL INTO HER ROOM
NOW DON'T CRY HE SAID AGAIN AS HE TURNED HIS
LOOK BACK INTO THE ROOM WHERE MRS
GRUBACH WAS STILL CRYING
I MEANT
NO HARM EITHER WHEN I SAID THAT
IT WAS SIMPLY A MISUNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN US
THAT CAN HAPPEN EVEN BETWEEN OLD FRIENDS SOMETIMES MRS
GRUBACH PULLED HER APRON DOWN TO BELOW HER EYES TO SEE WHETHER K
REALLY
WAS ATTEMPTING A RECONCILIATION
WELL YES THAT'S HOW IT IS SAID
K AND AS MRS
GRUBACH'S BEHAVIOUR INDICATED THAT THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID
NOTHING HE DARED TO ADD DO YOU REALLY THINK THEN THAT I'D WANT TO
MAKE AN ENEMY OF YOU FOR THE SAKE OF A GIRL WE HARDLY KNOW YES
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT MR
K SAID MRS
GRUBACH AND THEN TO HER
MISFORTUNE AS SOON AS SHE FELT JUST A LITTLE FREER TO SPEAK SHE ADDED
SOMETHING RATHER INEPT
I KEPT ASKING MYSELF WHY IT WAS THAT MR
K
TOOK SUCH AN INTEREST IN MISS BRSTNER
WHY DOES HE QUARREL WITH ME
OVER HER WHEN HE KNOWS THAT ANY CROSS WORD FROM HIM AND I CAN'T SLEEP
THAT NIGHT AND I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MISS BRSTNER THAT I HADN'T
SEEN WITH MY OWN EYES K
SAID NOTHING IN REPLY HE SHOULD HAVE CHASED
HER FROM THE ROOM AS SOON AS SHE HAD OPENED HER MOUTH AND HE DIDN'T
WANT TO DO THAT
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH MERELY DRINKING HIS COFFEE
AND LETTING MRS
GRUBACH FEEL THAT SHE WAS SUPERFLUOUS
OUTSIDE THE
DRAGGING STEPS OF MISS MONTAG COULD STILL BE HEARD AS SHE WENT FROM ONE
SIDE OF THE HALLWAY TO THE OTHER
DO YOU HEAR THAT ASKED K
POINTING
HIS HAND AT THE DOOR
YES SAID MRS
GRUBACH WITH A SIGH I WANTED
TO GIVE HER SOME HELP AND I WANTED THE MAID TO HELP HER TOO BUT SHE'S
STUBBORN SHE WANTS TO MOVE EVERYTHING IN HERSELF
I WONDER AT MISS
BRSTNER
I OFTEN FEEL IT'S A BURDEN FOR ME TO HAVE MISS MONTAG AS A
TENANT BUT MISS BRSTNER ACCEPTS HER INTO HER ROOM WITH HERSELF
THERE'S NOTHING THERE FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT SAID K CRUSHING THE
REMAINS OF A SUGAR LUMP IN HIS CUP
DOES SHE CAUSE YOU ANY TROUBLE
NO SAID MRS
GRUBACH IN ITSELF IT'S VERY GOOD TO HAVE HER THERE IT
MAKES ANOTHER ROOM FREE FOR ME AND I CAN LET MY NEPHEW THE CAPTAIN
OCCUPY IT
I BEGAN TO WORRY HE MIGHT BE DISTURBING YOU WHEN I HAD TO
LET HIM LIVE IN THE LIVING ROOM NEXT TO YOU OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS
HE'S NOT VERY CONSIDERATE WHAT AN IDEA SAID K
STANDING UP
THERE'S NO QUESTION OF THAT
YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT BECAUSE I CAN'T
STAND THIS TO ING AND FRO ING OF MISS MONTAG THAT I'M OVER SENSITIVE
AND THERE SHE GOES BACK AGAIN MRS
GRUBACH APPEARED QUITE POWERLESS
SHOULD I TELL HER TO LEAVE MOVING THE REST OF HER THINGS OVER TILL
LATER THEN MR
K IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT I'LL DO IT IMMEDIATELY
BUT SHE HAS TO MOVE IN WITH MISS BRSTNER SAID K
YES SAID MRS
GRUBACH WITHOUT QUITE UNDERSTANDING WHAT K
MEANT
SO SHE HAS TO TAKE
HER THINGS OVER THERE MRS
GRUBACH JUST NODDED
K
WAS IRRITATED ALL
THE MORE BY THIS DUMB HELPLESSNESS WHICH SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE COULD
HAVE SEEMED LIKE A KIND OF DEFIANCE ON HER PART
HE BEGAN TO WALK UP
AND DOWN THE ROOM BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE DOOR THUS DEPRIVING MRS
GRUBACH OF THE CHANCE TO LEAVE WHICH SHE OTHERWISE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
DONE
JUST AS K
ONCE MORE REACHED THE DOOR SOMEONE KNOCKED AT IT
IT
WAS THE MAID TO SAY THAT MISS MONTAG WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A FEW WORDS
WITH MR
K AND THEREFORE REQUESTED THAT HE COME TO THE DINING ROOM
WHERE SHE WAS WAITING FOR HIM
K
HEARD THE MAID OUT THOUGHTFULLY AND
THEN LOOKED BACK AT THE SHOCKED MRS
GRUBACH IN A WAY THAT WAS ALMOST
CONTEMPTUOUS
HIS LOOK SEEMED TO BE SAYING THAT K
HAD BEEN EXPECTING
THIS INVITATION FOR MISS MONTAG FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT IT WAS
CONFIRMATION OF THE SUFFERING HE HAD BEEN MADE TO ENDURE THAT SUNDAY
MORNING FROM MRS
GRUBACH'S TENANTS
HE SENT THE MAID BACK WITH THE
REPLY THAT HE WAS ON HIS WAY THEN HE WENT TO THE WARDROBE TO CHANGE HIS
COAT AND IN ANSWER TO MRS
GRUBACH'S GENTLE WHINING ABOUT THE NUISANCE
MISS MONTAG WAS CAUSING MERELY ASKED HER TO CLEAR AWAY THE BREAKFAST
THINGS
BUT YOU'VE HARDLY TOUCHED IT SAID MRS
GRUBACH
OH JUST
TAKE IT AWAY SHOUTED K
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT MISS MONTAG WAS MIXED
UP IN EVERYTHING AND MADE IT REPULSIVE TO HIM
AS HE WENT THROUGH THE HALLWAY HE LOOKED AT THE CLOSED DOOR OF
MISS BRSTNER'S ROOM
BUT IT WASN'T THERE THAT HE WAS INVITED BUT THE
DINING ROOM TO WHICH HE YANKED THE DOOR OPEN WITHOUT KNOCKING
THE ROOM WAS LONG BUT NARROW WITH ONE WINDOW
THERE WAS ONLY
ENOUGH SPACE AVAILABLE TO PUT TWO CUPBOARDS AT AN ANGLE IN THE CORNER BY
THE DOOR AND THE REST OF THE ROOM WAS ENTIRELY TAKEN UP WITH THE LONG
DINING TABLE WHICH STARTED BY THE DOOR AND REACHED ALL THE WAY TO THE
GREAT WINDOW WHICH WAS THUS MADE ALMOST INACCESSIBLE
THE TABLE WAS
ALREADY LAID FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS ON SUNDAYS ALMOST ALL THE
TENANTS ATE THEIR DINNER HERE AT MIDDAY
WHEN K
ENTERED MISS MONTAG CAME TOWARDS HIM FROM THE WINDOW
ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE
THEY GREETED EACH OTHER IN SILENCE
THEN
MISS MONTAG HER HEAD UNUSUALLY ERECT AS ALWAYS SAID I'M NOT SURE
WHETHER YOU KNOW ME K
LOOKED AT HER WITH A FROWN
OF COURSE I DO
HE SAID YOU'VE BEEN LIVING HERE WITH MRS
GRUBACH FOR QUITE SOME TIME
NOW BUT I GET THE IMPRESSION YOU DON'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THE LODGING HOUSE SAID MISS MONTAG
NO SAID K
WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO SIT DOWN SAID MISS MONTAG
IN SILENCE THE TWO
OF THEM DREW CHAIRS OUT FROM THE FARTHEST END OF THE TABLE AND SAT DOWN
FACING EACH OTHER
BUT MISS MONTAG STOOD STRAIGHT UP AGAIN AS SHE HAD
LEFT HER HANDBAG ON THE WINDOW SILL AND WENT TO FETCH IT SHE SHUFFLED
DOWN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE ROOM
WHEN SHE CAME BACK THE HANDBAG
LIGHTLY SWINGING SHE SAID I'D LIKE JUST TO HAVE A FEW WORDS WITH YOU
ON BEHALF OF MY FRIEND
SHE WOULD HAVE COME HERSELF BUT SHE'S FEELING
A LITTLE UNWELL TODAY
PERHAPS YOU'LL BE KIND ENOUGH TO FORGIVE HER AND
LISTEN TO ME INSTEAD
THERE'S ANYWAY NOTHING THAT SHE COULD HAVE SAID
THAT I WON'T
ON THE CONTRARY IN FACT I THINK I CAN SAY EVEN MORE
THAN HER BECAUSE I'M RELATIVELY IMPARTIAL
WOULD YOU NOT AGREE WHAT
IS THERE TO SAY THEN ANSWERED K WHO WAS TIRED OF MISS MONTAG
CONTINUOUSLY WATCHING HIS LIPS
IN THAT WAY SHE TOOK CONTROL OF WHAT HE
WANTED TO SAY BEFORE HE SAID IT
MISS BRSTNER CLEARLY REFUSES TO
GRANT ME THE PERSONAL MEETING THAT I ASKED HER FOR THAT'S HOW IT
IS SAID MISS MONTAG OR RATHER THAT'S NOT AT ALL HOW IT IS THE WAY
YOU PUT IT IS REMARKABLY SEVERE
GENERALLY SPEAKING MEETINGS ARE
NEITHER GRANTED NOR THE OPPOSITE
BUT IT CAN BE THAT MEETINGS ARE
CONSIDERED UNNECESSARY AND THAT'S HOW IT IS HERE
NOW AFTER YOUR
COMMENT I CAN SPEAK OPENLY
YOU ASKED MY FRIEND VERBALLY OR IN
WRITING FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HER
NOW MY FRIEND IS AWARE OF
YOUR REASONS FOR ASKING FOR THIS MEETING OR AT LEAST I SUPPOSE SHE IS
AND SO FOR REASONS I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SHE IS QUITE SURE THAT IT
WOULD BE OF NO BENEFIT TO ANYONE IF THIS MEETING ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE
MOREOVER IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY AND ONLY VERY BRIEFLY THAT SHE MADE IT
CLEAR TO ME THAT SUCH A MEETING COULD BE OF NO BENEFIT FOR YOURSELF
EITHER SHE FEELS THAT IT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF CHANCE THAT
SUCH AN IDEA CAME TO YOU AND THAT EVEN WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATIONS FROM
HER YOU WILL VERY SOON COME TO REALISE YOURSELF IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE
SO ALREADY THE FUTILITY OF YOUR IDEA
MY ANSWER TO THAT IS THAT
ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE QUITE RIGHT I CONSIDER IT ADVANTAGEOUS IF THE
MATTER IS TO BE MADE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO GIVE YOU AN EXPLICIT ANSWER
I
OFFERED MY SERVICES IN TAKING ON THE TASK AND AFTER SOME HESITATION MY
FRIEND CONCEDED
I HOPE HOWEVER ALSO TO HAVE ACTED IN YOUR INTERESTS
AS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST UNCERTAINTY IN THE LEAST SIGNIFICANT OF MATTERS
WILL ALWAYS REMAIN A CAUSE OF SUFFERING AND IF AS IN THIS CASE IT CAN
BE REMOVED WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT THEN IT IS BETTER IF THAT IS DONE
WITHOUT DELAY I THANK YOU SAID K
AS SOON AS MISS MONTAG HAD
FINISHED
HE STOOD SLOWLY UP LOOKED AT HER THEN ACROSS THE TABLE
THEN OUT THE WINDOW THE HOUSE OPPOSITE STOOD THERE IN THE SUN AND
WENT TO THE DOOR
MISS MONTAG FOLLOWED HIM A FEW PACES AS IF SHE DID
NOT QUITE TRUST HIM
AT THE DOOR HOWEVER BOTH OF THEM HAD TO STEP
BACK AS IT OPENED AND CAPTAIN LANZ ENTERED
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT K
HAD SEEN HIM CLOSE UP
HE WAS A LARGE MAN OF ABOUT FORTY WITH A
TANNED FLESHY FACE
HE BOWED SLIGHTLY INTENDING IT ALSO FOR K AND
THEN WENT OVER TO MISS MONTAG AND DEFERENTIALLY KISSED HER HAND
HE WAS
VERY ELEGANT IN THE WAY HE MOVED
THE COURTESY HE SHOWED TOWARDS MISS
MONTAG MADE A STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THE WAY SHE HAD BEEN TREATED BY K
NONETHELESS MISS MONTAG DID NOT SEEM TO BE CROSS WITH K
AS IT EVEN
SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE WANTED TO INTRODUCE THE CAPTAIN
K
HOWEVER DID
NOT WANT TO BE INTRODUCED HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SHOW ANY SORT
OF FRIENDLINESS EITHER TO MISS MONTAG OR TO THE CAPTAIN THE KISS ON THE
HAND HAD FOR K BOUND THEM INTO A GROUP WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM AT A
DISTANCE FROM MISS BRSTNER WHILST AT THE SAME TIME SEEMING TO BE
TOTALLY HARMLESS AND UNSELFISH
K
THOUGHT HOWEVER THAT HE SAW MORE
THAN THAT HE THOUGHT HE ALSO SAW THAT MISS MONTAG HAD CHOSEN A MEANS OF
DOING IT THAT WAS GOOD BUT TWO EDGED
SHE EXAGGERATED THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN K
AND MISS BRSTNER AND ABOVE ALL SHE
EXAGGERATED THE IMPORTANCE OF ASKING TO SPEAK WITH HER AND SHE TRIED AT
THE SAME TIME TO MAKE OUT THAT K
WAS EXAGGERATING EVERYTHING
SHE
WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED K
DID NOT WANT TO EXAGGERATE ANYTHING HE WAS
AWARE THAT MISS BRSTNER WAS A LITTLE TYPIST WHO WOULD NOT OFFER HIM
MUCH RESISTANCE FOR LONG
IN DOING SO HE DELIBERATELY TOOK NO ACCOUNT
OF WHAT MRS
GRUBACH HAD TOLD HIM ABOUT MISS BRSTNER
ALL THESE THINGS
WERE GOING THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE LEFT THE ROOM WITH HARDLY A POLITE
WORD
HE WANTED TO GO STRAIGHT TO HIS ROOM BUT A LITTLE LAUGH FROM
MISS MONTAG THAT HE HEARD FROM THE DINING ROOM BEHIND HIM BROUGHT HIM TO
THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT PREPARE A SURPRISE FOR THE TWO OF THEM THE
CAPTAIN AND MISS MONTAG
HE LOOKED ROUND AND LISTENED TO FIND OUT IF
THERE MIGHT BE ANY DISTURBANCE FROM ANY OF THE SURROUNDING ROOMS
EVERYWHERE WAS QUIET THE ONLY THING TO BE HEARD WAS THE CONVERSATION
FROM THE DINING ROOM AND MRS
GRUBACH'S VOICE FROM THE PASSAGE LEADING
TO THE KITCHEN
THIS SEEMED AN OPPORTUNE TIME K
WENT TO MISS
BRSTNER'S ROOM AND KNOCKED GENTLY
THERE WAS NO SOUND SO HE KNOCKED
AGAIN BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER IN REPLY
WAS SHE ASLEEP OR WAS
SHE REALLY UNWELL OR WAS SHE JUST PRETENDING AS SHE REALISED IT COULD
ONLY BE K
KNOCKING SO GENTLY K
ASSUMED SHE WAS PRETENDING AND
KNOCKED HARDER EVENTUALLY WHEN THE KNOCKING BROUGHT NO RESULT HE
CAREFULLY OPENED THE DOOR WITH THE SENSE OF DOING SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT
ONLY IMPROPER BUT ALSO POINTLESS
IN THE ROOM THERE WAS NO ONE
WHAT'S
MORE IT LOOKED HARDLY AT ALL LIKE THE ROOM K
HAD KNOWN BEFORE
AGAINST THE WALL THERE WERE NOW TWO BEDS BEHIND ONE ANOTHER THERE WERE
CLOTHES PILED UP ON THREE CHAIRS NEAR THE DOOR A WARDROBE STOOD OPEN
MISS BRSTNER MUST HAVE GONE OUT WHILE MISS MONTAG WAS SPEAKING TO HIM
IN THE DINING ROOM
K
WAS NOT GREATLY BOTHERED BY THIS HE HAD HARDLY
EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO FIND MISS BRSTNER SO EASILY AND HAD MADE THIS
ATTEMPT FOR LITTLE MORE REASON THAN TO SPITE MISS MONTAG
BUT THAT MADE
IT ALL THE MORE EMBARRASSING FOR HIM WHEN AS HE WAS CLOSING THE DOOR
AGAIN HE SAW MISS MONTAG AND THE CAPTAIN TALKING IN THE OPEN DOORWAY OF
THE DINING ROOM
THEY HAD PROBABLY BEEN STANDING THERE EVER SINCE K
HAD OPENED THE DOOR THEY AVOIDED SEEMING TO OBSERVE K
BUT CHATTED
LIGHTLY AND FOLLOWED HIS MOVEMENTS WITH GLANCES THE ABSENT MINDED
GLANCES TO THE SIDE SUCH AS YOU MAKE DURING A CONVERSATION
BUT THESE
GLANCES WERE HEAVY FOR K AND HE RUSHED ALONGSIDE THE WALL BACK INTO
HIS OWN ROOM
CHAPTER FIVE
THE WHIP MAN
ONE EVENING A FEW DAYS LATER K
WAS WALKING ALONG ONE OF THE
CORRIDORS THAT SEPARATED HIS OFFICE FROM THE MAIN STAIRWAY HE WAS
NEARLY THE LAST ONE TO LEAVE FOR HOME THAT EVENING THERE REMAINED ONLY
A COUPLE OF WORKERS IN THE LIGHT OF A SINGLE BULB IN THE DISPATCH
DEPARTMENT WHEN HE HEARD A SIGH FROM BEHIND A DOOR WHICH HE HAD
HIMSELF NEVER OPENED BUT WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT JUST LED INTO A
JUNK ROOM
HE STOOD IN AMAZEMENT AND LISTENED AGAIN TO ESTABLISH
WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT BE MISTAKEN
FOR A WHILE THERE WAS SILENCE BUT
THEN CAME SOME MORE SIGHS
HIS FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO FETCH ONE OF THE
SERVITORS IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN WORTH HAVING A WITNESS PRESENT BUT
THEN HE WAS TAKEN BY AN UNCONTROLLABLE CURIOSITY THAT MAKE HIM SIMPLY
YANK THE DOOR OPEN
IT WAS AS HE HAD THOUGHT A JUNK ROOM
OLD
UNUSABLE FORMS EMPTY STONE INK BOTTLES LAY SCATTERED BEHIND THE
ENTRANCE
BUT IN THE CUPBOARD LIKE ROOM ITSELF STOOD THREE MEN
CROUCHING UNDER THE LOW CEILING
A CANDLE FIXED ON A SHELF GAVE THEM
LIGHT
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ASKED K
QUIETLY BUT CROSSLY AND
WITHOUT THINKING
ONE OF THE MEN WAS CLEARLY IN CHARGE AND ATTRACTED
ATTENTION BY BEING DRESSED IN A KIND OF DARK LEATHER COSTUME WHICH LEFT
HIS NECK AND CHEST AND HIS ARMS EXPOSED
HE DID NOT ANSWER
BUT THE
OTHER TWO CALLED OUT MR
K WE'RE TO BE BEATEN BECAUSE YOU MADE A
COMPLAINT ABOUT US TO THE EXAMINING JUDGE AND NOW K
FINALLY
REALISED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE TWO POLICEMEN FRANZ AND WILLEM AND
THAT THE THIRD MAN HELD A CANE IN HIS HAND WITH WHICH TO BEAT THEM
WELL SAID K STARING AT THEM I DIDN'T MAKE ANY COMPLAINT I ONLY
SAID WHAT TOOK PLACE IN MY HOME
AND YOUR BEHAVIOUR WAS NOT ENTIRELY
UNOBJECTIONABLE AFTER ALL MR
K SAID WILLEM WHILE FRANZ CLEARLY
TRIED TO SHELTER BEHIND HIM AS PROTECTION FROM THE THIRD MAN IF YOU
KNEW HOW BADLY WE GET PAID YOU WOULDN'T THINK SO BADLY OF US
I'VE GOT
A FAMILY TO FEED AND FRANZ HERE WANTED TO GET MARRIED YOU JUST HAVE TO
GET MORE MONEY WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN'T DO IT JUST BY WORKING HARD NOT
HOWEVER HARD YOU TRY
I WAS SORELY TEMPTED BY YOUR FINE CLOTHES
POLICEMEN AREN'T ALLOWED TO DO THAT SORT OF THING COURSE THEY AREN'T
AND IT WASN'T RIGHT OF US BUT IT'S TRADITION THAT THE CLOTHES GO TO THE
OFFICERS THAT'S HOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN BELIEVE ME AND IT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE TOO ISN'T IT WHAT CAN THINGS LIKE THAT MEAN FOR ANYONE
UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ARRESTED BUT IF HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT IT OPENLY
THEN THE PUNISHMENT HAS TO FOLLOW I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THIS
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME AND I MADE NO SORT OF REQUEST THAT YOU BE
PUNISHED I WAS SIMPLY ACTING ON PRINCIPLE FRANZ SAID WILLEM
TURNING TO THE OTHER POLICEMAN DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT THE GENTLEMAN
DIDN'T SAY HE WANTED US TO BE PUNISHED NOW YOU CAN HEAR FOR YOURSELF
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE'D HAVE TO BE PUNISHED DON'T YOU LET THEM
PERSUADE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT SAID THE THIRD MAN TO K THIS
PUNISHMENT IS BOTH JUST AND UNAVOIDABLE DON'T LISTEN TO HIM SAID
WILLEM INTERRUPTING HIMSELF ONLY TO QUICKLY BRING HIS HAND TO HIS MOUTH
WHEN IT HAD RECEIVED A STROKE OF THE CANE WE'RE ONLY BEING PUNISHED
BECAUSE YOU MADE A COMPLAINT AGAINST US
NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO
US OTHERWISE NOT EVEN IF THEY'D FOUND OUT WHAT WE'D DONE
CAN YOU CALL
THAT JUSTICE BOTH OF US ME ESPECIALLY WE'D PROVED OUR WORTH AS GOOD
POLICE OFFICERS OVER A LONG PERIOD YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT YOURSELF THAT
AS FAR AS OFFICIAL WORK WAS CONCERNED WE DID THE JOB WELL THINGS
LOOKED GOOD FOR US WE HAD PROSPECTS IT'S QUITE CERTAIN THAT WE
WOULD'VE BEEN MADE WHIP MEN TOO LIKE THIS ONE ONLY HE HAD THE LUCK NOT
TO HAVE ANYONE MAKE A COMPLAINT ABOUT HIM AS YOU REALLY DON'T GET MANY
COMPLAINTS LIKE THAT
ONLY THAT'S ALL FINISHED NOW MR
K OUR CAREERS
ARE AT AN END WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WORK NOW THAT'S FAR INFERIOR TO
POLICE WORK AND BESIDES ALL THIS WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS TERRIBLE
PAINFUL BEATING CAN THE CANE REALLY CAUSE SO MUCH PAIN THEN ASKED
K TESTING THE CANE THAT THE WHIP MAN SWANG IN FRONT OF HIM
WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO STRIP OFF TOTALLY NAKED SAID WILLEM
OH I SEE
SAID K LOOKING STRAIGHT AT THE WHIP MAN HIS SKIN WAS BURNED BROWN
LIKE A SAILOR'S AND HIS FACE SHOWED HEALTH AND VIGOUR
IS THERE
THEN NO POSSIBILITY OF SPARING THESE TWO THEIR BEATING HE ASKED HIM
NO SAID THE WHIP MAN SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH A LAUGH
GET
UNDRESSED HE ORDERED THE POLICEMEN
AND TO K
HE SAID YOU SHOULDN'T
BELIEVE EVERYTHING THEY TELL YOU IT'S THE FEAR OF BEING BEATEN IT'S
ALREADY MADE THEM A BIT WEAK IN THE HEAD
THIS ONE HERE FOR INSTANCE
HE POINTED AT WILLEM ALL THAT HE TOLD YOU ABOUT HIS CAREER PROSPECTS
IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS
LOOK AT HIM LOOK HOW FAT HE IS THE FIRST
STROKES OF THE CANE WILL JUST GET LOST IN ALL THAT FAT
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT IS THAT'S MADE HIM SO FAT HE'S IN THE HABIT OF EVERYONE THAT
GETS ARRESTED BY HIM HE EATS THEIR BREAKFAST
DIDN'T HE EAT UP YOUR
BREAKFAST YEAH I THOUGHT AS MUCH
BUT A MAN WITH A BELLY LIKE THAT
CAN'T BE MADE INTO A WHIP MAN AND NEVER WILL BE THAT IS QUITE OUT OF
THE QUESTION THERE ARE WHIP MEN LIKE THAT WILLEM INSISTED WHO HAD
JUST RELEASED THE BELT OF THIS TROUSERS
NO SAID THE WHIP MAN
STRIKING HIM SUCH A BLOW WITH THE CANE ON HIS NECK THAT IT MADE HIM
WINCE YOU SHOULDN'T BE LISTENING TO THIS JUST GET UNDRESSED I
WOULD MAKE IT WELL WORTH YOUR WHILE IF YOU WOULD LET THEM GO SAID K
AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE WHIP MAN AGAIN AS SUCH MATTERS ARE BEST
CARRIED ON WITH BOTH PAIRS OF EYES TURNED DOWN HE PULLED OUT HIS
WALLET
AND THEN YOU'D TRY AND PUT IN A COMPLAINT AGAINST ME TOO
SAID THE WHIP MAN AND GET ME FLOGGED
NO NO NOW DO BE
REASONABLE SAID K IF I HAD WANTED TO GET THESE TWO PUNISHED I WOULD
NOT NOW BE TRYING TO BUY THEIR FREEDOM WOULD I
I COULD SIMPLY CLOSE
THE DOOR HERE BEHIND ME GO HOME AND SEE OR HEAR NOTHING MORE OF IT
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M DOING IT REALLY IS OF MUCH MORE IMPORTANCE TO
ME TO LET THEM GO FREE IF I HAD REALISED THEY WOULD BE PUNISHED OR
EVEN THAT THEY MIGHT BE PUNISHED I WOULD NEVER HAVE NAMED THEM IN THE
FIRST PLACE AS THEY ARE NOT THE ONES I HOLD RESPONSIBLE
IT'S THE
ORGANISATION THAT'S TO BLAME THE HIGH OFFICIALS ARE THE ONES TO BLAME
THAT'S HOW IT IS SHOUTED THE POLICEMEN WHO THEN IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED
ANOTHER BLOW ON THEIR BACKS WHICH WERE BY NOW EXPOSED
IF YOU HAD A
SENIOR JUDGE HERE BENEATH YOUR STICK SAID K PRESSING DOWN THE CANE
AS HE SPOKE TO STOP IT BEING RAISED ONCE MORE I REALLY WOULD DO
NOTHING TO STOP YOU ON THE CONTRARY I WOULD EVEN PAY YOU MONEY TO GIVE
YOU ALL THE MORE STRENGTH YEAH THAT'S ALL VERY PLAUSIBLE WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING THERE SAID THE WHIP MAN ONLY I'M NOT THE SORT OF
PERSON YOU CAN BRIBE
IT'S MY JOB TO FLOG PEOPLE SO I FLOG THEM
FRANZ THE POLICEMAN HAD BEEN FAIRLY QUIET SO FAR PROBABLY IN
EXPECTATION OF A GOOD RESULT FROM K 'S INTERVENTION BUT NOW HE STEPPED
FORWARD TO THE DOOR WEARING JUST HIS TROUSERS KNEELED DOWN HANGING ON
TO K 'S ARM AND WHISPERED EVEN IF YOU CAN'T GET MERCY SHOWN FOR BOTH
OF US AT LEAST TRY AND GET ME SET FREE
WILLEM IS OLDER THAN ME HE'S
LESS SENSITIVE THAN ME IN EVERY WAY HE EVEN GOT A LIGHT BEATING A
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO BUT MY RECORD'S STILL CLEAN I ONLY DID THINGS THE
WAY I DID BECAUSE WILLEM LED ME ON TO IT HE'S BEEN MY TEACHER BOTH FOR
GOOD AND BAD
DOWN IN FRONT OF THE BANK MY POOR BRIDE IS WAITING FOR ME
AT THE ENTRANCE I'M SO ASHAMED OF MYSELF IT'S PITIFUL HIS FACE WAS
FLOWING OVER WITH TEARS AND HE WIPED IT DRY ON K 'S COAT
I'M NOT
GOING TO WAIT ANY LONGER SAID THE WHIP MAN TAKING HOLD OF THE CANE IN
BOTH HANDS AND LAYING IN TO FRANZ WHILE WILLEM COWERED BACK IN A CORNER
AND LOOKED ON SECRETLY NOT EVEN DARING TO TURN HIS HEAD
THEN THE
SUDDEN SCREAM THAT SHOT OUT FROM FRANZ WAS LONG AND IRREVOCABLE IT
SEEMED TO COME NOT FROM A HUMAN BEING BUT FROM AN INSTRUMENT THAT WAS
BEING TORTURED THE WHOLE CORRIDOR RANG WITH IT IT MUST HAVE BEEN HEARD
BY EVERYONE IN THE BUILDING
DON'T SHOUT LIKE THAT CALLED OUT K
UNABLE TO PREVENT HIMSELF AND AS HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY IN THE DIRECTION
FROM WHICH THE SERVITOR WOULD COME HE GAVE FRANZ A SHOVE NOT HARD BUT
HARD ENOUGH FOR HIM TO FALL DOWN UNCONSCIOUS CLAWING AT THE GROUND WITH
HIS HANDS BY REFLEX HE STILL DID NOT AVOID BEING HIT THE ROD STILL
FOUND HIM ON THE FLOOR THE TIP OF THE ROD SWANG REGULARLY UP AND DOWN
WHILE HE ROLLED TO AND FRO UNDER ITS BLOWS
AND NOW ONE OF THE
SERVITORS APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE WITH ANOTHER A FEW STEPS BEHIND HIM
K
HAD QUICKLY THROWN THE DOOR SHUT GONE OVER TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
OVERLOOKING THE YARD AND OPENED IT
THE SCREAMS HAD COMPLETELY STOPPED
SO THAT THE SERVITOR WOULDN'T COME IN HE CALLED OUT IT'S ONLY ME
GOOD EVENING CHIEF CLERK SOMEBODY CALLED BACK
IS THERE ANYTHING
WRONG NO NO ANSWERED K IT'S ONLY A DOG YELPING IN THE YARD
THERE WAS NO SOUND FROM THE SERVITORS SO HE ADDED YOU CAN GO BACK TO
WHAT YOU WERE DOING HE DID NOT WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED WITH A
CONVERSATION WITH THEM AND SO HE LEANT OUT OF THE WINDOW
A LITTLE
WHILE LATER WHEN HE LOOKED OUT IN THE CORRIDOR THEY HAD ALREADY GONE
NOW K
REMAINED AT THE WINDOW HE DID NOT DARE GO BACK INTO THE JUNK
ROOM AND HE DID NOT WANT TO GO HOME EITHER
THE YARD HE LOOKED DOWN
INTO WAS SMALL AND RECTANGULAR ALL AROUND IT WERE OFFICES ALL THE
WINDOWS WERE NOW DARK AND ONLY THOSE AT THE VERY TOP CAUGHT A REFLECTION
OF THE MOON
K TRIED HARD TO SEE INTO THE DARKNESS OF ONE CORNER OF THE
YARD WHERE A FEW HANDCARTS HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND ONE ANOTHER
HE FELT
ANGUISH AT NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT THE FLOGGING BUT THAT WAS
NOT HIS FAULT IF FRANZ HAD NOT SCREAMED LIKE THAT CLEARLY IT MUST
HAVE CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL
OF ONESELF AT IMPORTANT MOMENTS IF FRANZ HAD NOT SCREAMED THEN IT WAS
AT LEAST HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT K
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISSUADE THE
WHIP MAN
IF ALL THE JUNIOR OFFICERS WERE CONTEMPTIBLE WHY WOULD THE
WHIP MAN WHOSE POSITION WAS THE MOST INHUMANE OF ALL BE ANY EXCEPTION
AND K
HAD NOTICED VERY CLEARLY HOW HIS EYES HAD LIT UP WHEN HE SAW THE
BANKNOTES HE HAD OBVIOUSLY ONLY SEEMED SERIOUS ABOUT THE FLOGGING TO
RAISE THE LEVEL OF THE BRIBE A LITTLE
AND K
HAD NOT BEEN UNGENEROUS
HE REALLY HAD WANTED TO GET THE POLICEMEN FREED IF HE REALLY HAD NOW
BEGUN TO DO SOMETHING AGAINST THE DEGENERACY OF THE COURT THEN IT WAS A
MATTER OF COURSE THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO DO SOMETHING HERE AS WELL
BUT
OF COURSE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO ANYTHING AS SOON AS FRANZ
STARTED SCREAMING
K
COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET THE JUNIOR BANK
STAFF AND PERHAPS EVEN ALL SORTS OF OTHER PEOPLE COME ALONG AND CATCH
HIM BY SURPRISE AS HE HAGGLED WITH THOSE PEOPLE IN THE JUNK ROOM
NOBODY COULD REALLY EXPECT THAT SORT OF SACRIFICE OF HIM
IF THAT HAD
BEEN HIS INTENTION THEN IT WOULD ALMOST HAVE BEEN EASIER K
WOULD HAVE
TAKEN HIS OWN CLOTHES OFF AND OFFERED HIMSELF TO THE WHIP MAN IN THE
POLICEMEN'S PLACE
THE WHIP MAN WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE ACCEPTED THIS
SUBSTITUTION ANYWAY AS IN THAT WAY HE WOULD HAVE SERIOUSLY VIOLATED HIS
DUTY WITHOUT GAINING ANY BENEFIT
HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE VIOLATED
HIS DUTY TWICE OVER AS COURT EMPLOYEES WERE PROBABLY UNDER ORDERS NOT
TO CAUSE ANY HARM TO K
WHILE HE WAS FACING CHARGES ALTHOUGH THERE MAY
HAVE BEEN SPECIAL CONDITIONS IN FORCE HERE
HOWEVER THINGS STOOD K
WAS ABLE TO DO NO MORE THAN THROW THE DOOR SHUT EVEN THOUGH THAT WOULD
STILL DO NOTHING TO REMOVE ALL THE DANGERS HE FACED
IT WAS REGRETTABLE
THAT HE HAD GIVEN FRANZ A SHOVE AND IT COULD ONLY BE EXCUSED BY THE
HEAT OF THE MOMENT
IN THE DISTANCE HE HEARD THE STEPS OF THE SERVITORS HE DID NOT
WANT THEM TO BE TOO AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE SO HE CLOSED THE WINDOW AND
WALKED TOWARDS THE MAIN STAIRCASE
AT THE DOOR OF THE JUNK ROOM HE
STOPPED AND LISTENED FOR A LITTLE WHILE
ALL WAS SILENT
THE TWO
POLICEMEN WERE ENTIRELY AT THE WHIP MAN'S MERCY HE COULD HAVE BEATEN
THEM TO DEATH
K
REACHED HIS HAND OUT FOR THE DOOR HANDLE BUT DREW IT
SUDDENLY BACK
HE WAS NO LONGER IN ANY POSITION TO HELP ANYONE AND THE
SERVITORS WOULD SOON BE BACK HE DID THOUGH PROMISE HIMSELF THAT HE
WOULD RAISE THE MATTER AGAIN WITH SOMEBODY AND SEE THAT AS FAR AS IT
WAS IN HIS POWER THOSE WHO REALLY WERE GUILTY THE HIGH OFFICIALS WHOM
NOBODY HAD SO FAR DARED POINT OUT TO HIM RECEIVED THEIR DUE PUNISHMENT
AS HE WENT DOWN THE MAIN STAIRWAY AT THE FRONT OF THE BANK HE LOOKED
CAREFULLY ROUND AT EVERYONE WHO WAS PASSING BUT THERE WAS NO GIRL TO BE
SEEN WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEBODY NOT EVEN WITHIN SOME
DISTANCE FROM THE BANK
FRANZ'S CLAIM THAT HIS BRIDE WAS WAITING FOR
HIM WAS THUS SHOWN TO BE A LIE ALBEIT ONE THAT WAS FORGIVABLE AND
INTENDED ONLY TO ELICIT MORE SYMPATHY
THE POLICEMEN WERE STILL ON K 'S MIND ALL THROUGH THE FOLLOWING
DAY HE WAS UNABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON HIS WORK AND HAD TO STAY IN HIS
OFFICE A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE PREVIOUS DAY SO THAT HE COULD FINISH IT
ON THE WAY HOME AS HE PASSED BY THE JUNK ROOM AGAIN HE OPENED ITS DOOR
AS IF THAT HAD BEEN HIS HABIT
INSTEAD OF THE DARKNESS HE EXPECTED HE
SAW EVERYTHING UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND DID NOT KNOW HOW
HE SHOULD RESPOND
EVERYTHING WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS HE HAD SEEN IT
WHEN HE HAD OPENED THE DOOR THE PREVIOUS EVENING
THE FORMS AND
BOTTLES OF INK JUST INSIDE THE DOORWAY THE WHIP MAN WITH HIS CANE THE
TWO POLICEMEN STILL UNDRESSED THE CANDLE ON THE SHELF AND THE TWO
POLICEMEN BEGAN TO WAIL AND CALL OUT MR
K K
SLAMMED THE DOOR
IMMEDIATELY SHUT AND EVEN THUMPED ON IT WITH HIS FISTS AS IF THAT WOULD
SHUT IT ALL THE FIRMER
ALMOST IN TEARS HE RAN TO THE SERVITORS
WORKING QUIETLY AT THE COPYING MACHINE
GO AND GET THAT JUNK ROOM
CLEARED OUT HE SHOUTED AND IN AMAZEMENT THEY STOPPED WHAT THEY WERE
DOING
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE LONG AGO WE'RE SINKING IN DIRT THEY
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE JOB THE NEXT DAY K
NODDED IT WAS TOO LATE IN
THE EVENING TO MAKE THEM DO IT THERE AND THEN AS HE HAD ORIGINALLY
INTENDED
HE SAT DOWN BRIEFLY IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM NEAR HIM FOR A
LITTLE LONGER LOOKED THROUGH A FEW OF THE COPIES TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION
THAT HE WAS CHECKING THEM AND THEN AS HE SAW THAT THEY WOULD NOT DARE
TO LEAVE AT THE SAME TIME AS HIMSELF WENT HOME TIRED AND WITH HIS MIND
NUMB
CHAPTER SIX
K 'S UNCLE LENI
ONE AFTERNOON K
WAS VERY BUSY AT THE TIME GETTING THE POST
READY K 'S UNCLE KARL A SMALL COUNTRY LAND OWNER CAME INTO THE ROOM
PUSHING HIS WAY BETWEEN TWO OF THE STAFF WHO WERE BRINGING IN SOME
PAPERS
K
HAD LONG EXPECTED HIS UNCLE TO APPEAR BUT THE SIGHT OF HIM
NOW SHOCKED K
FAR LESS THAN THE PROSPECT OF IT HAD DONE A LONG TIME
BEFORE
HIS UNCLE WAS BOUND TO COME K
HAD BEEN SURE OF THAT FOR ABOUT
A MONTH
HE ALREADY THOUGHT AT THE TIME HE COULD SEE HOW HIS UNCLE
WOULD ARRIVE SLIGHTLY BOWED HIS BATTERED PANAMA HAT IN HIS LEFT HAND
HIS RIGHT HAND ALREADY STRETCHED OUT OVER THE DESK LONG BEFORE HE WAS
CLOSE ENOUGH AS HE RUSHED CARELESSLY TOWARDS K
KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING
THAT WAS IN HIS WAY
K 'S UNCLE WAS ALWAYS IN A HURRY AS HE SUFFERED
FROM THE UNFORTUNATE BELIEF THAT HE HAD A NUMBER THINGS TO DO WHILE HE
WAS IN THE BIG CITY AND HAD TO SETTLE ALL OF THEM IN ONE DAY HIS
VISITS WERE ONLY EVER FOR ONE DAY AND AT THE SAME TIME THOUGHT HE
COULD NOT FORGO ANY CONVERSATION OR PIECE OF BUSINESS OR PLEASURE THAT
MIGHT ARISE BY CHANCE
UNCLE KARL WAS K 'S FORMER GUARDIAN AND SO K
WAS DUTY BOUND TO HELP HIM IN ALL OF THIS AS WELL AS TO OFFER HIM A BED
FOR THE NIGHT
'I'M HAUNTED BY A GHOST FROM THE COUNTRY' HE WOULD SAY
AS SOON AS THEY HAD GREETED EACH OTHER K
HAD INVITED HIM TO SIT
IN THE ARMCHAIR BUT UNCLE KARL HAD NO TIME FOR THAT HE SAID HE WANTED
TO SPEAK BRIEFLY WITH K
IN PRIVATE
IT IS NECESSARY HE SAID WITH A
TIRED GULP IT IS NECESSARY FOR MY PEACE OF MIND K
IMMEDIATELY
SENT THE JUNIOR STAFF FROM THE ROOM AND TOLD THEM TO LET NO ONE IN
WHAT'S THIS THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING JOSEF CRIED K 'S UNCLE WHEN THEY
WERE ALONE AS HE SAT ON THE TABLE SHOVING VARIOUS PAPERS UNDER HIMSELF
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE COMFORTABLE
K
SAID
NOTHING HE KNEW WHAT WAS COMING BUT SUDDENLY RELIEVED FROM THE EFFORT
OF THE WORK HE HAD BEEN DOING HE GAVE WAY TO A PLEASANT LASSITUDE AND
LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET
FROM WHERE HE
SAT HE COULD SEE JUST A SMALL TRIANGULAR SECTION OF IT PART OF THE
EMPTY WALLS OF HOUSES BETWEEN TWO SHOP WINDOWS
YOU'RE STARING OUT THE
WINDOW CALLED OUT HIS UNCLE RAISING HIS ARMS FOR GOD'S SAKE JOSEF
GIVE ME AN ANSWER IS IT TRUE CAN IT REALLY BE TRUE UNCLE KARL
SAID K WRENCHING HIMSELF BACK FROM HIS DAYDREAMING I REALLY DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME JOSEF SAID HIS UNCLE IN A WARNING
TONE AS FAR AS I KNOW YOU'VE ALWAYS TOLD THE TRUTH
AM I TO TAKE
WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID AS A BAD SIGN I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS YOU
WANT SAID K
OBEDIENTLY I EXPECT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MY TRIAL
THAT'S RIGHT ANSWERED HIS UNCLE WITH A SLOW NOD I'VE HEARD ABOUT
YOUR TRIAL WHO DID YOU HEAR IT FROM THEN ASKED K
ERNA WROTE TO
ME SAID HIS UNCLE SHE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH YOU IT'S TRUE
YOU DON'T PAY VERY MUCH ATTENTION TO HER I'M AFRAID TO SAY BUT SHE
LEARNED ABOUT IT NONETHELESS
I GOT HER LETTER TODAY AND OF COURSE I
CAME STRAIGHT HERE
AND FOR NO OTHER REASON BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
THIS IS REASON ENOUGH
I CAN READ YOU OUT THE PART OF THE LETTER THAT
CONCERNS YOU HE DREW THE LETTER OUT FROM HIS WALLET
HERE IT IS
SHE WRITES 'I HAVE NOT SEEN JOSEF FOR A LONG TIME I WAS IN THE BANK
LAST WEEK BUT JOSEF WAS SO BUSY THAT THEY WOULD NOT LET ME THROUGH I
WAITED THERE FOR NEARLY AN HOUR BUT THEN I HAD TO GO HOME AS I HAD MY
PIANO LESSON
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM MAYBE THERE
WILL BE A CHANCE ANOTHER TIME
HE SENT ME A BIG BOX OF CHOCOLATES FOR
MY NAME DAY THAT WAS VERY NICE AND ATTENTIVE OF HIM
I FORGOT TO TELL
YOU ABOUT IT WHEN I WROTE AND I ONLY REMEMBER NOW THAT YOU ASK ME ABOUT
IT
CHOCOLATE AS I AM SURE YOU ARE AWARE DISAPPEARS STRAIGHT AWAY IN
THIS LODGING HOUSE ALMOST AS SOON AS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAS GIVEN YOU
CHOCOLATE IT IS GONE
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE I WANTED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT JOSEF
LIKE I SAID THEY WOULD NOT LET ME THROUGH TO SEE HIM AT
THE BANK BECAUSE HE WAS NEGOTIATING WITH SOME GENTLEMAN JUST THEN
AFTER I HAD BEEN WAITING QUIETLY FOR QUITE A LONG TIME I ASKED ONE OF
THE STAFF WHETHER HIS MEETING WOULD LAST MUCH LONGER
HE SAID IT MIGHT
WELL DO AS IT WAS PROBABLY ABOUT THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS HE SAID THAT
WERE BEING CONDUCTED AGAINST HIM
I ASKED WHAT SORT OF LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS IT WAS THAT WERE BEING CONDUCTED AGAINST THE CHIEF CLERK
AND WHETHER HE WAS NOT MAKING SOME MISTAKE BUT HE SAID HE WAS NOT
MAKING ANY MISTAKE THERE WERE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS UNDERWAY AND EVEN THAT
THEY WERE ABOUT SOMETHING QUITE SERIOUS BUT HE DID NOT KNOW ANY MORE
ABOUT IT
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN OF SOME HELP TO THE CHIEF
CLERK HIMSELF AS THE CHIEF CLERK WAS A GENTLEMAN GOOD AND HONEST BUT
HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS HE COULD DO AND MERELY HOPED THERE WOULD BE
SOME INFLUENTIAL GENTLEMEN WHO WOULD TAKE HIS SIDE
I'M SURE THAT IS
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND THAT EVERYTHING WILL TURN OUT FOR THE BEST IN THE
END BUT IN THE MEAN TIME THINGS DO NOT LOOK AT ALL GOOD AND YOU CAN
SEE THAT FROM THE MOOD OF THE CHIEF CLERK HIMSELF
OF COURSE I DID NOT
PLACE TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE ON THIS CONVERSATION AND EVEN DID MY BEST TO
PUT THE BANK CLERK'S MIND AT REST HE WAS QUITE A SIMPLE MAN
I TOLD
HIM HE WAS NOT TO SPEAK TO ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THIS AND I THINK IT IS ALL
JUST A RUMOUR BUT I STILL THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD IF YOU DEAR FATHER
IF YOU LOOKED INTO THE MATTER THE NEXT TIME YOU VISIT
IT WILL BE EASY
FOR YOU TO FIND OUT MORE DETAIL AND IF IT IS REALLY NECESSARY TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT THROUGH THE GREAT AND INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE YOU KNOW
BUT IF IT IS NOT NECESSARY AND THAT IS WHAT SEEMS MOST LIKELY THEN AT
LEAST YOUR DAUGHTER WILL SOON HAVE THE CHANCE TO EMBRACE YOU AND I LOOK
FORWARD TO IT SHE'S A GOOD CHILD SAID K 'S UNCLE WHEN HE HAD
FINISHED READING AND WIPED A FEW TEARS FROM HIS EYES
K
NODDED
WITH
ALL THE DIFFERENT DISRUPTIONS HE HAD HAD RECENTLY HE HAD COMPLETELY
FORGOTTEN ABOUT ERNA EVEN HER BIRTHDAY AND THE STORY OF THE CHOCOLATES
HAD CLEARLY JUST BEEN INVENTED SO THAT HE WOULDN'T GET IN TROUBLE WITH
HIS AUNT AND UNCLE
IT WAS VERY TOUCHING AND EVEN THE THEATRE TICKETS
WHICH HE WOULD REGULARLY SEND HER FROM THEN ON WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO
REPAY HER BUT HE REALLY DID NOT FEEL NOW THAT IT WAS RIGHT FOR HIM
TO VISIT HER IN HER LODGINGS AND HOLD CONVERSATIONS WITH A LITTLE
EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SCHOOLGIRL
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT
ASKED HIS UNCLE WHO HAD FORGOTTEN ALL HIS RUSH AND EXCITEMENT AS HE READ
THE LETTER AND SEEMED TO BE ABOUT TO READ IT AGAIN
YES UNCLE SAID
K IT IS TRUE TRUE CALLED OUT HIS UNCLE
WHAT IS TRUE HOW CAN
THIS BE TRUE WHAT SORT OF TRIAL IS IT NOT A CRIMINAL TRIAL I HOPE
IT'S A CRIMINAL TRIAL ANSWERED K
AND YOU SIT QUIETLY HERE WHILE
YOU'VE GOT A CRIMINAL TRIAL ROUND YOUR NECK SHOUTED HIS UNCLE GETTING
EVER LOUDER
THE MORE CALM I AM THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR THE
OUTCOME SAID K
IN A TIRED VOICE DON'T WORRY HOW CAN I HELP
WORRYING SHOUTED HIS UNCLE JOSEF MY DEAR JOSEF THINK ABOUT
YOURSELF ABOUT YOUR FAMILY THINK ABOUT OUR GOOD NAME UP TILL NOW
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN OUR PRIDE DON'T NOW BECOME OUR DISGRACE
I DON'T
LIKE THE WAY YOU'RE BEHAVING HE SAID LOOKING AT K
WITH HIS HEAD AT
AN ANGLE THAT'S NOT HOW AN INNOCENT MAN BEHAVES WHEN HE'S ACCUSED OF
SOMETHING NOT IF HE'S STILL GOT ANY STRENGTH IN HIM
JUST TELL ME WHAT
IT'S ALL ABOUT SO THAT I CAN HELP YOU
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE
BANK I TAKE IT NO SAID K
AS HE STOOD UP AND YOU'RE SPEAKING
TOO LOUD UNCLE I EXPECT ONE OF THE STAFF IS LISTENING AT THE DOOR AND
I FIND THAT RATHER UNPLEASANT
IT'S BEST IF WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN
I CAN ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS AS FAR AS I CAN
AND I KNOW VERY WELL
THAT I HAVE TO ACCOUNT TO THE FAMILY FOR WHAT I DO YOU CERTAINLY
DO HIS UNCLE SHOUTED QUITE RIGHT YOU DO
NOW JUST GET A MOVE ON
JOSEF HURRY UP NOW I STILL HAVE A FEW DOCUMENTS I NEED TO PREPARE
SAID K AND USING THE INTERCOM HE SUMMONED HIS DEPUTY WHO ENTERED A
FEW MOMENTS LATER
K 'S UNCLE STILL ANGRY AND EXCITED GESTURED WITH
HIS HAND TO SHOW THAT K
HAD SUMMONED HIM EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO NEED
WHATEVER TO DO SO
K
STOOD IN FRONT OF THE DESK AND EXPLAINED TO THE
YOUNG MAN WHO LISTENED CALM AND ATTENTIVE WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE
THAT DAY IN HIS ABSENCE SPEAKING IN A CALM VOICE AND MAKING USE OF
VARIOUS DOCUMENTS
THE PRESENCE OF K 'S UNCLE WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON
WAS QUITE DISTURBING HE DID NOT LISTEN TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID BUT AT
FIRST HE STOOD THERE WITH EYES WIDE OPEN AND NERVOUSLY BITING HIS LIPS
THEN HE BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM STOPPED NOW AND THEN AT THE
WINDOW OR STOOD IN FRONT OF A PICTURE ALWAYS MAKING VARIOUS
EXCLAMATIONS SUCH AS THAT IS TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME OR NOW
JUST TELL ME WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO MAKE OF THAT THE YOUNG MAN
PRETENDED TO NOTICE NOTHING OF THIS AND LISTENED TO K 'S INSTRUCTIONS
THROUGH TO THE END HE MADE A FEW NOTES BOWED TO BOTH K
AND HIS UNCLE
AND THEN LEFT THE ROOM
K 'S UNCLE HAD TURNED HIS BACK TO HIM AND WAS
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW BUNCHING UP THE CURTAINS WITH HIS OUTSTRETCHED
HANDS
THE DOOR HAD HARDLY CLOSED WHEN HE CALLED OUT AT LAST NOW
THAT HE'S STOPPED JUMPING ABOUT WE CAN GO TOO ONCE THEY WERE IN THE
FRONT HALL OF THE BANK WHERE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF STAFF WERE STANDING
ABOUT AND WHERE JUST THEN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WAS WALKING ACROSS
THERE WAS UNFORTUNATELY NO WAY OF STOPPING K 'S UNCLE FROM CONTINUALLY
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TRIAL
NOW THEN JOSEF HE BEGAN LIGHTLY
ACKNOWLEDGING THE BOWS FROM THOSE AROUND THEM AS THEY PASSED TELL ME
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS TRIAL WHAT SORT OF TRIAL IS IT K
MADE A FEW
COMMENTS WHICH CONVEYED LITTLE INFORMATION EVEN LAUGHED A LITTLE AND
IT WAS ONLY WHEN THEY REACHED THE FRONT STEPS THAT HE EXPLAINED TO HIS
UNCLE THAT HE HAD NOT WANTED TO TALK OPENLY IN FRONT OF THOSE PEOPLE
QUITE RIGHT SAID HIS UNCLE BUT NOW START TALKING WITH HIS HEAD
TO ONE SIDE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR IN SHORT IMPATIENT DRAUGHTS HE
LISTENED
FIRST OF ALL UNCLE SAID K IT'S NOT A TRIAL LIKE YOU'D
HAVE IN A NORMAL COURTROOM SO MUCH THE WORSE SAID HIS UNCLE
HOW'S THAT ASKED K LOOKING AT HIM
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT'S FOR THE
WORSE HE REPEATED
THEY WERE STANDING ON THE FRONT STEPS OF THE BANK
AS THE DOORKEEPER SEEMED TO BE LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING K
DREW HIS UNCLE DOWN FURTHER WHERE THEY WERE ABSORBED INTO THE BUSTLE OF
THE STREET
HIS UNCLE TOOK K 'S ARM AND STOPPED ASKING QUESTIONS WITH
SUCH URGENCY ABOUT THE TRIAL THEY WALKED ON FOR A WHILE IN SILENCE
BUT HOW DID ALL THIS COME ABOUT HE EVENTUALLY ASKED STOPPING
ABRUPTLY ENOUGH TO STARTLE THE PEOPLE WALKING BEHIND WHO HAD TO AVOID
WALKING INTO HIM
THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T COME ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY
START DEVELOPING A LONG TIME BEFOREHAND THERE MUST HAVE BEEN WARNING
SIGNS OF IT WHY DIDN'T YOU WRITE TO ME YOU KNOW I'D DO ANYTHING FOR
YOU TO SOME EXTENT I AM STILL YOUR GUARDIAN AND UNTIL TODAY THAT'S
SOMETHING I WAS PROUD OF
I'LL STILL HELP YOU OF COURSE I WILL ONLY
NOW NOW THAT THE TRIAL IS ALREADY UNDERWAY IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT
BUT WHATEVER THE BEST THING NOW IS FOR YOU TO TAKE A SHORT HOLIDAY
STAYING WITH US IN THE COUNTRY
YOU'VE LOST WEIGHT I CAN SEE THAT NOW
THE COUNTRY LIFE WILL GIVE YOU STRENGTH THAT WILL BE GOOD THERE'S
BOUND TO BE A LOT OF HARD WORK AHEAD OF YOU
BUT BESIDES THAT IT'LL BE
A WAY OF GETTING YOU AWAY FROM THE COURT TO SOME EXTENT
HERE THEY'VE
GOT EVERY MEANS OF SHOWING THE POWERS AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND THEY'RE
AUTOMATICALLY BOUND TO USE THEM AGAINST YOU IN THE COUNTRY THEY'LL
EITHER HAVE TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY TO DIFFERENT BODIES OR JUST HAVE TO
TRY AND BOTHER YOU BY LETTER TELEGRAM OR TELEPHONE
AND THAT'S BOUND
TO WEAKEN THE EFFECT IT WON'T RELEASE YOU FROM THEM BUT IT'LL GIVE YOU
ROOM TO BREATHE YOU COULD FORBID ME TO LEAVE SAID K WHO HAD BEEN
DRAWN SLIGHTLY INTO HIS UNCLE'S WAY OF THINKING BY WHAT HE HAD BEEN
SAYING
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD DO IT SAID HIS UNCLE THOUGHTFULLY
YOU WON'T SUFFER TOO MUCH LOSS OF POWER BY MOVING AWAY K
GRASPED
HIS UNCLE UNDER THE ARM TO PREVENT HIM STOPPING STILL AND SAID I
THOUGHT YOU'D THINK ALL THIS IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN I DO AND NOW YOU'RE
TAKING IT SO HARD JOSEF CALLED HIS UNCLE TRYING TO DISENTANGLE
HIMSELF FROM HIM SO THAT HE COULD STOP WALKING BUT K
DID NOT LET GO
YOU'VE COMPLETELY CHANGED YOU USED TO BE SO ASTUTE ARE YOU LOSING IT
NOW DO YOU WANT TO LOSE THE TRIAL DO YOU REALISE WHAT THAT WOULD
MEAN THAT WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD BE SIMPLY DESTROYED
AND THAT EVERYONE
YOU KNOW WOULD BE PULLED DOWN WITH YOU OR AT THE VERY LEAST HUMILIATED
DISGRACED RIGHT DOWN TO THE GROUND
JOSEF PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
THE
WAY YOU'RE SO INDIFFERENT ABOUT IT IT'S DRIVING ME MAD
LOOKING AT YOU
I CAN ALMOST BELIEVE THAT OLD SAYING 'HAVING A TRIAL LIKE THAT MEANS
LOSING A TRIAL LIKE THAT' MY DEAR UNCLE SAID K IT WON'T DO ANY
GOOD TO GET EXCITED IT'S NO GOOD FOR YOU TO DO IT AND IT'D BE NO GOOD
FOR ME TO DO IT
THE CASE WON'T BE WON BY GETTING EXCITED AND PLEASE
ADMIT THAT MY PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE COUNTS FOR SOMETHING JUST AS I HAVE
ALWAYS AND STILL DO RESPECT YOUR EXPERIENCE EVEN WHEN IT SURPRISES ME
YOU SAY THAT THE FAMILY WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THIS TRIAL I REALLY
CAN'T SEE HOW BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT AND I'M QUITE WILLING TO
FOLLOW YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN ALL OF THIS
ONLY I DON'T SEE ANY
ADVANTAGE IN STAYING IN THE COUNTRY NOT EVEN FOR YOU AS THAT WOULD
INDICATE FLIGHT AND A SENSE OF GUILT
AND BESIDES ALTHOUGH I AM MORE
SUBJECT TO PERSECUTION IF I STAY IN THE CITY I CAN ALSO PRESS THE MATTER
FORWARD BETTER HERE YOU'RE RIGHT SAID HIS UNCLE IN A TONE THAT
SEEMED TO INDICATE THEY WERE FINALLY COMING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER I
JUST MADE THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE AS I SAW IT IF YOU STAY IN THE CITY
THE CASE WILL BE PUT IN DANGER BY YOUR INDIFFERENCE TO IT AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS BETTER IF I DID THE WORK FOR YOU
BUT WILL YOU PUSH THINGS
FORWARD YOURSELF WITH ALL YOUR STRENGTH IF SO THAT WILL NATURALLY BE
FAR BETTER WE'RE AGREED THEN SAID K
AND DO YOU HAVE ANY
SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT WELL NATURALLY I'LL HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT IT SAID HIS UNCLE YOU MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT I'VE BEEN
LIVING IN THE COUNTRY FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW ALMOST WITHOUT A BREAK YOU
LOSE YOUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH MATTERS LIKE THIS
BUT I DO HAVE SOME
IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO I EXPECT KNOW THEIR WAY
AROUND THESE THINGS BETTER THAN I DO AND TO CONTACT THEM IS A MATTER OF
COURSE
OUT THERE IN THE COUNTRY I'VE BEEN GETTING OUT OF CONDITION
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALREADY AWARE OF THAT
IT'S ONLY AT TIMES LIKE THIS
THAT YOU NOTICE IT YOURSELF
AND THIS AFFAIR OF YOURS CAME LARGELY
UNEXPECTED ALTHOUGH ODDLY ENOUGH I HAD EXPECTED SOMETHING OF THE SORT
AFTER I'D READ ERNA'S LETTER AND TODAY WHEN I SAW YOUR FACE I KNEW IT
WITH ALMOST TOTAL CERTAINTY
BUT ALL THAT IS BY THE BY THE IMPORTANT
THING NOW IS WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE EVEN WHILE HE WAS STILL
SPEAKING K 'S UNCLE HAD STOOD ON TIPTOE TO SUMMON A TAXI AND NOW HE
PULLED K
INTO THE CAR BEHIND HIMSELF AS HE CALLED OUT AN ADDRESS TO THE
DRIVER
WE'RE GOING NOW TO SEE DR
HULD THE LAWYER HE SAID WE
WERE AT SCHOOL TOGETHER
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THE NAME DON'T YOU NO
WELL THAT IS ODD
HE'S GOT A VERY GOOD REPUTATION AS A DEFENCE
BARRISTER AND FOR WORKING WITH THE POOR
BUT I ESTEEM HIM ESPECIALLY AS
SOMEONE YOU CAN TRUST IT'S ALRIGHT WITH ME WHATEVER YOU DO SAID
K ALTHOUGH HE WAS MADE UNEASY BY THE RUSHED AND URGENT WAY HIS UNCLE
WAS DEALING WITH THE MATTER
IT WAS NOT VERY ENCOURAGING AS THE
ACCUSED BE TO TAKEN TO A LAWYER FOR POOR PEOPLE
I DIDN'T KNOW HE
SAID THAT YOU COULD TAKE ON A LAWYER IN MATTERS LIKE THIS WELL OF
COURSE YOU CAN SAID HIS UNCLE THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING
WHY
WOULDN'T YOU TAKE ON A LAWYER AND NOW SO THAT I'M PROPERLY INSTRUCTED
IN THIS MATTER TELL ME WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING SO FAR K
INSTANTLY
BEGAN TELLING HIS UNCLE ABOUT WHAT HAD BEEN HAPPENING HOLDING NOTHING
BACK BEING COMPLETELY OPEN WITH HIM WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT K
COULD
PROTEST AT HIS UNCLE'S BELIEF THAT THE TRIAL WAS A GREAT DISGRACE
HE
MENTIONED MISS BRSTNER'S NAME JUST ONCE AND IN PASSING BUT THAT DID
NOTHING TO DIMINISH HIS OPENNESS ABOUT THE TRIAL AS MISS BRSTNER HAD NO
CONNECTION WITH IT
AS HE SPOKE HE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND SAW HOW
JUST THEN THEY WERE GETTING CLOSER TO THE SUBURB WHERE THE COURT
OFFICES WERE
HE DREW THIS TO HIS UNCLE'S ATTENTION BUT HE DID NOT
FIND THE COINCIDENCE ESPECIALLY REMARKABLE
THE TAXI STOPPED IN FRONT
OF A DARK BUILDING
K 'S UNCLE KNOCKED AT THE VERY FIRST DOOR AT GROUND
LEVEL WHILE THEY WAITED HE SMILED SHOWING HIS BIG TEETH AND
WHISPERED EIGHT O'CLOCK NOT THE USUAL SORT OF TIME TO BE VISITING A
LAWYER BUT HULD WON'T MIND IT FROM ME TWO LARGE BLACK EYES APPEARED
IN THE SPY HATCH IN THE DOOR THEY STARED AT THE TWO VISITORS FOR A
WHILE AND THEN DISAPPEARED THE DOOR HOWEVER DID NOT OPEN
K
AND HIS
UNCLE CONFIRMED TO EACH OTHER THE FACT THAT THEY HAD SEEN THE TWO EYES
A NEW MAID AFRAID OF STRANGERS SAID K 'S UNCLE AND KNOCKED AGAIN
THE EYES APPEARED ONCE MORE
THIS TIME THEY SEEMED ALMOST SAD BUT THE
OPEN GAS FLAME THAT BURNED WITH A HISS CLOSE ABOVE THEIR HEADS GAVE OFF
LITTLE LIGHT AND THAT MAY HAVE MERELY CREATED AN ILLUSION
OPEN THE
DOOR CALLED K 'S UNCLE RAISING HIS FIST AGAINST IT WE ARE FRIENDS
OF DR
HULD THE LAWYER DR
HULD IS ILL WHISPERED SOMEONE BEHIND
THEM
IN A DOORWAY AT THE FAR END OF A NARROW PASSAGE STOOD A MAN IN
HIS DRESSING GOWN GIVING THEM THIS INFORMATION IN AN EXTREMELY QUIET
VOICE
K 'S UNCLE WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE VERY ANGRY BY THE LONG
WAIT TURNED ABRUPTLY ROUND AND RETORTED ILL YOU SAY HE'S ILL AND
STRODE TOWARDS THE GENTLEMAN IN A WAY THAT SEEMED ALMOST THREATENING AS
IF HE WERE THE ILLNESS HIMSELF
THEY'VE OPENED THE DOOR FOR YOU NOW
SAID THE GENTLEMAN POINTING AT THE DOOR OF THE LAWYER
HE PULLED HIS
DRESSING GOWN TOGETHER AND DISAPPEARED
THE DOOR HAD INDEED BEEN
OPENED A YOUNG GIRL K
RECOGNISED THE DARK SLIGHTLY BULGING EYES
STOOD IN THE HALLWAY IN A LONG WHITE APRON HOLDING A CANDLE IN HER
HAND
NEXT TIME OPEN UP SOONER SAID K 'S UNCLE INSTEAD OF A
GREETING WHILE THE GIRL MADE A SLIGHT CURTSEY
COME ALONG JOSEF HE
THEN SAID TO K
WHO WAS SLOWLY MOVING OVER TOWARDS THE GIRL
DR
HULD
IS UNWELL SAID THE GIRL AS K 'S UNCLE WITHOUT STOPPING RUSHED
TOWARDS ONE OF THE DOORS
K
CONTINUED TO LOOK AT THE GIRL IN AMAZEMENT
AS SHE TURNED ROUND TO BLOCK THE WAY INTO THE LIVING ROOM SHE HAD A
ROUND FACE LIKE A PUPPY'S NOT ONLY THE PALE CHEEKS AND THE CHIN WERE
ROUND BUT THE TEMPLES AND THE HAIRLINE WERE TOO
JOSEF CALLED HIS
UNCLE ONCE MORE AND HE ASKED THE GIRL IT'S TROUBLE WITH HIS HEART IS
IT I THINK IT IS SIR SAID THE GIRL WHO BY NOW HAD FOUND TIME TO
GO AHEAD WITH THE CANDLE AND OPEN THE DOOR INTO THE ROOM
IN ONE CORNER
OF THE ROOM WHERE THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE DID NOT REACH A FACE WITH A
LONG BEARD LOOKED UP FROM THE BED
LENI WHO'S THIS COMING IN ASKED
THE LAWYER UNABLE TO RECOGNISE HIS GUESTS BECAUSE HE WAS DAZZLED BY THE
CANDLE
IT'S YOUR OLD FRIEND ALBERT SAID K 'S UNCLE
OH ALBERT
SAID THE LAWYER FALLING BACK ONTO HIS PILLOW AS IF THIS VISIT MEANT HE
WOULD NOT NEED TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES
IS IT REALLY AS BAD AS THAT
ASKED K 'S UNCLE SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE BED
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
IS
IT'S A RECURRENCE OF YOUR HEART TROUBLE AND IT'LL PASS OVER LIKE
THE OTHER TIMES MAYBE SAID THE LAWYER QUIETLY BUT IT'S JUST AS
MUCH TROUBLE AS IT'S EVER BEEN
I CAN HARDLY BREATHE I CAN'T SLEEP AT
ALL AND I'M GETTING WEAKER BY THE DAY I SEE SAID K 'S UNCLE
PRESSING HIS PANAMA HAT FIRMLY AGAINST HIS KNEE WITH HIS BIG HAND
THAT IS BAD NEWS
BUT ARE YOU GETTING THE RIGHT SORT OF CARE AND
IT'S SO DEPRESSING IN HERE IT'S SO DARK
IT'S A LONG TIME SINCE I WAS
LAST HERE BUT IT SEEMED TO ME FRIENDLIER THEN
EVEN YOUR YOUNG LADY
HERE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH LIFE IN HER UNLESS SHE'S JUST
PRETENDING THE MAID WAS STILL STANDING BY THE DOOR WITH THE CANDLE
AS FAR AS COULD BE MADE OUT SHE WAS WATCHING K
MORE THAN SHE WAS
WATCHING HIS UNCLE EVEN WHILE THE LATTER WAS STILL SPEAKING ABOUT HER
K
LEANT AGAINST A CHAIR THAT HE HAD PUSHED NEAR TO THE GIRL
WHEN
YOU'RE AS ILL AS I AM SAID THE LAWYER YOU NEED TO HAVE PEACE
I
DON'T FIND IT DEPRESSING AFTER A SHORT PAUSE HE ADDED AND LENI
LOOKS AFTER ME WELL SHE'S A GOOD GIRL BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO
PERSUADE K 'S UNCLE HE HAD VISIBLY TAKEN AGAINST HIS FRIEND'S CARER
AND EVEN THOUGH HE DID NOT CONTRADICT THE INVALID HE PERSECUTED HER
WITH HIS SCOWL AS SHE WENT OVER TO THE BED PUT THE CANDLE ON THE
BEDSIDE TABLE AND LEANING OVER THE BED MADE A FUSS OF HIM BY TIDYING
THE PILLOWS
K 'S UNCLE NEARLY FORGOT THE NEED TO SHOW ANY
CONSIDERATION FOR THE MAN WHO LAY ILL IN BED HE STOOD UP WALKED UP AND
DOWN BEHIND THE CARER AND K
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF HE HAD
GRABBED HOLD OF HER SKIRTS BEHIND HER AND DRAGGED HER AWAY FROM THE BED
K
HIMSELF LOOKED ON CALMLY HE WAS NOT EVEN DISAPPOINTED AT FINDING THE
LAWYER UNWELL HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO NOTHING TO OPPOSE THE ENTHUSIASM
HIS UNCLE HAD DEVELOPED FOR THE MATTER HE WAS GLAD THAT THIS ENTHUSIASM
HAD NOW BEEN DISTRACTED WITHOUT HIS HAVING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
HIS
UNCLE PROBABLY SIMPLY WISHING TO BE OFFENSIVE TO THE LAWYER'S
ATTENDANT THEN SAID YOUNG LADY NOW PLEASE LEAVE US ALONE FOR A
WHILE I HAVE SOME PERSONAL MATTERS TO DISCUSS WITH MY FRIEND DR
HULD'S CARER WAS STILL LEANT FAR OVER THE INVALID'S BED AND SMOOTHING
OUT THE CLOTH COVERING THE WALL NEXT TO IT SHE MERELY TURNED HER HEAD
AND THEN IN STRIKING CONTRAST WITH THE ANGER THAT FIRST STOPPED K 'S
UNCLE FROM SPEAKING AND THEN LET THE WORDS OUT IN A GUSH SHE SAID VERY
QUIETLY YOU CAN SEE THAT DR
HULD IS SO ILL THAT HE CAN'T DISCUSS ANY
MATTERS AT ALL IT WAS PROBABLY JUST FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE THAT
SHE HAD REPEATED THE WORDS SPOKEN BY K 'S UNCLE BUT AN ONLOOKER MIGHT
EVEN HAVE PERCEIVED IT AS MOCKING HIM AND HE OF COURSE JUMPED UP AS IF
HE HAD JUST BEEN STABBED
YOU DAMNED IN THE FIRST GURGLINGS OF
HIS EXCITEMENT HIS WORDS COULD HARDLY BE UNDERSTOOD K
WAS STARTLED
EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN EXPECTING SOMETHING OF THE SORT AND RAN TO HIS
UNCLE WITH THE INTENTION NO DOUBT OF CLOSING HIS MOUTH WITH BOTH HIS
HANDS
FORTUNATELY THOUGH BEHIND THE GIRL THE INVALID RAISED HIMSELF
UP K 'S UNCLE MADE AN UGLY FACE AS IF SWALLOWING SOMETHING DISGUSTING
AND THEN SOMEWHAT CALMER SAID WE HAVE NATURALLY NOT LOST OUR SENSES
NOT YET IF WHAT I AM ASKING FOR WERE NOT POSSIBLE I WOULD NOT BE ASKING
FOR IT
NOW PLEASE GO THE CARER STOOD UP STRAIGHT BY THE BED
DIRECTLY FACING K 'S UNCLE K
THOUGHT HE NOTICED THAT WITH ONE HAND SHE
WAS STROKING THE LAWYER'S HAND
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING IN FRONT OF
LENI SAID THE INVALID IN A TONE THAT WAS UNMISTAKABLY IMPLORING
IT'S NOT MY BUSINESS SAID K 'S UNCLE AND IT'S NOT MY SECRETS AND
HE TWISTED HIMSELF ROUND AS IF WANTING TO GO INTO NO MORE NEGOTIATIONS
BUT GIVING HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE TIME TO THINK
WHOSE BUSINESS IS IT
THEN ASKED THE LAWYER IN AN EXHAUSTED VOICE AS HE LEANT BACK AGAIN
MY NEPHEW'S SAID K 'S UNCLE AND I'VE BROUGHT HIM ALONG WITH ME
AND HE INTRODUCED HIM CHIEF CLERK JOSEF K OH SAID THE INVALID
NOW WITH MUCH MORE LIFE IN HIM AND REACHED OUT HIS HAND TOWARDS K
DO
FORGIVE ME I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU THERE AT ALL THEN HE THEN SAID TO HIS
CARER LENI GO STRETCHING HIS HAND OUT TO HER AS IF THIS WERE A
FAREWELL THAT WOULD HAVE TO LAST FOR A LONG TIME
THIS TIME THE GIRL
OFFERED NO RESISTANCE
SO YOU HE FINALLY SAID TO K 'S UNCLE WHO HAD
ALSO CALMED DOWN AND STEPPED CLOSER YOU HAVEN'T COME TO VISIT ME
BECAUSE I'M ILL BUT YOU'VE COME ON BUSINESS THE LAWYER NOW LOOKED SO
MUCH STRONGER THAT IT SEEMED THE IDEA OF BEING VISITED BECAUSE HE WAS
ILL HAD SOMEHOW MADE HIM WEAK HE REMAINED SUPPORTING HIMSELF OF ONE
ELBOW WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN RATHER TIRING AND CONTINUALLY PULLED AT A
LOCK OF HAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BEARD
YOU ALREADY LOOK MUCH
BETTER SAID K 'S UNCLE NOW THAT THAT WITCH HAS GONE OUTSIDE HE
INTERRUPTED HIMSELF WHISPERED I BET YOU SHE'S LISTENING AND SPRANG
OVER TO THE DOOR
BUT BEHIND THE DOOR THERE WAS NO ONE K 'S UNCLE CAME
BACK NOT DISAPPOINTED AS HER NOT LISTENING SEEMED TO HIM WORSE THAN IF
SHE HAD BEEN BUT PROBABLY SOMEWHAT EMBITTERED
YOU'RE MISTAKEN ABOUT
HER SAID THE LAWYER BUT DID NOTHING MORE TO DEFEND HER PERHAPS THAT
WAS HIS WAY OF INDICATING THAT SHE DID NOT NEED DEFENDING
BUT IN A
TONE THAT WAS MUCH MORE COMMITTED HE WENT ON AS FAR AS YOUR NEPHEW'S
AFFAIRS ARE CONCERNED THIS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
AND I'D COUNT MYSELF LUCKY IF MY STRENGTH LASTED OUT LONG ENOUGH FOR IT
I'M GREATLY AFRAID IT WON'T DO BUT ANYWAY I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
ANYTHING UNTRIED IF I DON'T LAST OUT YOU CAN ALWAYS GET SOMEBODY ELSE
TO BE HONEST THIS MATTER INTERESTS ME TOO MUCH AND I CAN'T BRING
MYSELF TO GIVE UP THE CHANCE OF TAKING SOME PART IN IT
IF MY HEART
DOES TOTALLY GIVE OUT THEN AT LEAST IT WILL HAVE FOUND A WORTHY AFFAIR
TO FAIL IN K
BELIEVED HE UNDERSTOOD NOT A WORD OF THIS ENTIRE
SPEECH HE LOOKED AT HIS UNCLE FOR AN EXPLANATION BUT HIS UNCLE SAT ON
THE BEDSIDE TABLE WITH THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND A MEDICINE BOTTLE HAD
ROLLED OFF THE TABLE ONTO THE FLOOR HE NODDED TO EVERYTHING THE LAWYER
SAID AGREED TO EVERYTHING AND NOW AND THEN LOOKED AT K
URGING HIM TO
SHOW THE SAME COMPLIANCE
MAYBE K 'S UNCLE HAD ALREADY TOLD THE LAWYER
ABOUT THE TRIAL
BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED
SO FAR SPOKE AGAINST IT
SO HE SAID
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WELL MAYBE I'VE MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN SAYING SAID THE LAWYER JUST AS ASTONISHED AND EMBARRASSED AS K
PERHAPS I'VE BEEN GOING TOO FAST
WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED TO SPEAK TO
ME ABOUT I THOUGHT IT WAS TO DO WITH YOUR TRIAL OF COURSE IT IS
SAID K 'S UNCLE WHO THEN ASKED K SO WHAT IS IT YOU WANT YES BUT
HOW IS IT THAT YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME AND MY CASE ASKED K
OH I
SEE SAID THE LAWYER WITH A SMILE
I AM A LAWYER I MOVE IN COURT
CIRCLES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT VARIOUS DIFFERENT CASES AND THE MORE
INTERESTING ONES STAY IN YOUR MIND ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CONCERN THE
NEPHEW OF A FRIEND
THERE'S NOTHING VERY REMARKABLE ABOUT THAT WHAT
IS IT YOU WANT THEN ASKED K 'S UNCLE ONCE MORE YOU SEEM SO UNEASY
ABOUT IT YOU MOVE IN THIS COURT'S CIRCLES ASKED K
YES SAID THE
LAWYER
YOU'RE ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE A CHILD SAID K 'S UNCLE
WHAT
CIRCLES SHOULD I MOVE IN THEN IF NOT WITH MEMBERS OF MY OWN
DISCIPLINE THE LAWYER ADDED
IT SOUNDED SO INDISPUTABLE THAT K
GAVE
NO ANSWER AT ALL
BUT YOU WORK IN THE HIGH COURT NOT THAT COURT IN
THE ATTIC HE HAD WANTED TO SAY BUT COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO ACTUALLY
UTTER IT
YOU HAVE TO REALISE THE LAWYER CONTINUED IN A TONE AS IF
HE WERE EXPLAINING SOMETHING OBVIOUS UNNECESSARY AND INCIDENTAL YOU
HAVE TO REALISE THAT I ALSO DERIVE GREAT ADVANTAGE FOR MY CLIENTS FROM
MIXING WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND DO SO IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS IT'S NOT
SOMETHING YOU CAN KEEP TALKING ABOUT ALL THE TIME
I'M AT A BIT OF A
DISADVANTAGE NOW OF COURSE BECAUSE OF MY ILLNESS BUT I STILL GET
VISITS FROM SOME GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE AT THE COURT AND I LEARN ONE OR
TWO THINGS
IT MIGHT EVEN BE THAT I LEARN MORE THAN MANY OF THOSE WHO
ARE IN THE BEST OF HEALTH AND SPEND ALL DAY IN COURT
AND I'M RECEIVING
A VERY WELCOME VISIT RIGHT NOW FOR INSTANCE AND HE POINTED INTO A
DARK CORNER OF THE ROOM
WHERE ASKED K ALMOST UNCOUTH IN HIS
SURPRISE
HE LOOKED ROUND UNEASILY THE LITTLE CANDLE GAVE OFF FAR TOO
LITTLE LIGHT TO REACH AS FAR AS THE WALL OPPOSITE
AND THEN SOMETHING
DID INDEED BEGIN TO MOVE THERE IN THE CORNER
IN THE LIGHT OF THE
CANDLE HELD UP BY K 'S UNCLE AN ELDERLY GENTLEMAN COULD BE SEEN SITTING
BESIDE A SMALL TABLE
HE HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR SO LONG WITHOUT
BEING NOTICED THAT HE COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN BREATHING
NOW HE STOOD UP
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FUSS CLEARLY UNHAPPY THAT ATTENTION HAD BEEN DRAWN
TO HIM
IT WAS AS IF BY FLAPPING HIS HANDS ABOUT LIKE SHORT WINGS HE
HOPED TO DEFLECT ANY INTRODUCTIONS AND GREETINGS AS IF HE WANTED ON NO
ACCOUNT TO DISTURB THE OTHERS BY HIS PRESENCE AND SEEMED TO BE EXHORTING
THEM TO LEAVE HIM BACK IN THE DARK AND FORGET ABOUT HIS BEING THERE
THAT HOWEVER WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD NO LONGER BE GRANTED HIM
YOU
TOOK US BY SURPRISE YOU SEE SAID THE LAWYER IN EXPLANATION
CHEERFULLY INDICATING TO THE GENTLEMAN THAT HE SHOULD COME CLOSER
WHICH SLOWLY HESITATINGLY LOOKING ALL AROUND HIM BUT WITH A CERTAIN
DIGNITY HE DID
THE OFFICE DIRECTOR OH YES FORGIVE ME I HAVEN'T
INTRODUCED YOU THIS IS MY FRIEND ALBERT K THIS IS HIS NEPHEW THE
CHIEF CLERK JOSEF K AND THIS IS THE OFFICE DIRECTOR SO THE OFFICE
DIRECTOR WAS KIND ENOUGH TO PAY ME A VISIT
IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE TO
APPRECIATE JUST HOW VALUABLE A VISIT LIKE THIS IS IF YOU'VE BEEN LET
INTO THE SECRET OF WHAT A PILE OF WORK THE OFFICE DIRECTOR HAS HEAPED
OVER HIM
WELL HE CAME ANYWAY WE WERE HAVING A PEACEFUL CHAT AS FAR
AS I WAS ABLE WHEN I'M SO WEAK AND ALTHOUGH WE HADN'T TOLD LENI SHE
MUSTN'T LET ANYONE IN AS WE WEREN'T EXPECTING ANYONE WE STILL WOULD
RATHER HAVE REMAINED ALONE BUT THEN ALONG CAME YOU ALBERT THUMPING
YOUR FISTS ON THE DOOR THE OFFICE DIRECTOR MOVED OVER INTO THE CORNER
PULLING HIS TABLE AND CHAIR WITH HIM BUT NOW IT TURNS OUT WE MIGHT
HAVE THAT IS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WISH WE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO
DISCUSS WITH EACH OTHER AND IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE CAN ALL COME BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN
OFFICE DIRECTOR HE SAID WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE
SIDE POINTING WITH A HUMBLE SMILE TO AN ARMCHAIR NEAR THE BED
I'M
AFRAID I'LL ONLY BE ABLE TO STAY A FEW MINUTES MORE SMILED THE OFFICE
DIRECTOR AS HE SPREAD HIMSELF OUT IN THE ARMCHAIR AND LOOKED AT THE
CLOCK
BUSINESS CALLS
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO MISS THE CHANCE OF
MEETING A FRIEND OF MY FRIEND HE INCLINED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY TOWARD
K 'S UNCLE WHO SEEMED VERY HAPPY WITH HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE BUT HE WAS
NOT THE SORT OF PERSON TO EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS OF DEFERENCE AND
RESPONDED TO THE OFFICE DIRECTOR'S WORDS WITH EMBARRASSED BUT LOUD
LAUGHTER
A HORRIBLE SIGHT K
WAS ABLE TO QUIETLY WATCH EVERYTHING AS
NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HIM THE OFFICE DIRECTOR TOOK OVER AS
LEADER OF THE CONVERSATION AS SEEMED TO BE HIS HABIT ONCE HE HAD BEEN
CALLED FORWARD THE LAWYER LISTENED ATTENTIVELY WITH HIS HAND TO HIS
EAR HIS INITIAL WEAKNESS HAVING PERHAPS ONLY HAD THE FUNCTION OF
DRIVING AWAY HIS NEW VISITORS K 'S UNCLE SERVED AS CANDLE BEARER
BALANCING THE CANDLE ON HIS THIGH WHILE THE OFFICE DIRECTOR FREQUENTLY
GLANCED NERVOUSLY AT IT AND WAS SOON FREE OF HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND WAS
QUICKLY ENCHANTED NOT ONLY BY THE OFFICE DIRECTOR'S SPEAKING MANNER BUT
ALSO BY THE GENTLE WAVING HAND MOVEMENTS WITH WHICH HE ACCOMPANIED IT
K LEANING AGAINST THE BEDPOST WAS TOTALLY IGNORED BY THE OFFICE
DIRECTOR PERHAPS DELIBERATELY AND SERVED THE OLD MAN ONLY AS AUDIENCE
AND BESIDES HE HAD HARDLY ANY IDEA WHAT THE CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT AND
HIS THOUGHTS SOON TURNED TO THE CARE ASSISTANT AND THE ILL TREATMENT SHE
HAD SUFFERED FROM HIS UNCLE
SOON AFTER HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE
HAD NOT SEEN THE OFFICE DIRECTOR SOMEWHERE BEFORE PERHAPS AMONG THE
PEOPLE WHO WERE AT HIS FIRST HEARING
HE MAY HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN BUT
THOUGHT THE OFFICE DIRECTOR MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN AMONG THE OLD GENTLEMEN
WITH THE THIN BEARDS IN THE FIRST ROW
THERE WAS THEN A NOISE THAT EVERYONE HEARD FROM THE HALLWAY AS IF
SOMETHING OF PORCELAIN WERE BEING BROKEN
I'LL GO AND SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENED SAID K WHO SLOWLY LEFT THE ROOM AS IF GIVING THE OTHERS THE
CHANCE TO STOP HIM
HE HAD HARDLY STEPPED INTO THE HALLWAY FINDING HIS
BEARINGS IN THE DARKNESS WITH HIS HAND STILL FIRMLY HOLDING THE DOOR
WHEN ANOTHER SMALL HAND MUCH SMALLER THAN K 'S OWN PLACED ITSELF ON
HIS AND GENTLY SHUT THE DOOR
IT WAS THE CARER WHO HAD BEEN WAITING
THERE
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED SHE WHISPERED TO HIM I JUST THREW A
PLATE AGAINST THE WALL TO GET YOU OUT OF THERE I WAS THINKING ABOUT
YOU AS WELL REPLIED K
UNEASILY
SO MUCH THE BETTER SAID THE
CARER
COME WITH ME
A FEW STEPS ALONG THEY CAME TO A FROSTED GLASS
DOOR WHICH THE CARER OPENED FOR HIM
COME IN HERE SHE SAID
IT WAS
CLEARLY THE LAWYER'S OFFICE FITTED OUT WITH OLD HEAVY FURNITURE AS
FAR AS COULD BE SEEN IN THE MOONLIGHT WHICH NOW ILLUMINATED JUST A
SMALL RECTANGULAR SECTION OF THE FLOOR BY EACH OF THE THREE BIG
WINDOWS
THIS WAY SAID THE CARER POINTING TO A DARK TRUNK WITH A
CARVED WOODEN BACKREST
WHEN HE HAD SAT DOWN K
CONTINUED TO LOOK
ROUND THE ROOM IT WAS A LARGE ROOM WITH A HIGH CEILING THE CLIENTS OF
THIS LAWYER FOR THE POOR MUST HAVE FELT QUITE LOST IN IT
K
THOUGHT HE
COULD SEE THE LITTLE STEPS WITH WHICH VISITORS WOULD APPROACH THE
MASSIVE DESK
BUT THEN HE FORGOT ABOUT ALL OF THIS AND HAD EYES ONLY
FOR THE CARER WHO SAT VERY CLOSE BESIDE HIM ALMOST PRESSING HIM AGAINST
THE ARMREST
I DID THINK SHE SAID YOU WOULD COME OUT HERE TO ME BY
YOURSELF WITHOUT ME HAVING TO CALL YOU FIRST
IT WAS ODD
FIRST YOU STARE
AT ME AS SOON AS YOU COME IN AND THEN YOU KEEP ME WAITING
AND YOU
OUGHT TO CALL ME LENI TOO SHE ADDED QUICKLY AND SUDDENLY AS IF NO
MOMENT OF THIS CONVERSATION SHOULD BE LOST
GLADLY SAID K
BUT AS
FOR ITS BEING ODD LENI THAT'S EASY TO EXPLAIN
FIRSTLY I HAD TO
LISTEN TO WHAT THE OLD MEN WERE SAYING AND COULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT A GOOD
REASON BUT SECONDLY I'M NOT A BOLD PERSON IF ANYTHING I'M QUITE SHY
AND YOU LENI YOU DIDN'T REALLY LOOK LIKE YOU COULD BE WON OVER IN ONE
STROKE EITHER THAT'S NOT IT SAID LENI LAYING ONE ARM ON THE
ARMREST AND LOOKING AT K YOU DIDN'T LIKE ME AND I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU
LIKE ME NOW EITHER LIKING WOULDN'T BE VERY MUCH SAID K
EVASIVELY
OH SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A SMILE THUS MAKING USE OF K 'S
COMMENT TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE OVER HIM
SO K
REMAINED SILENT FOR A
WHILE
BY NOW HE HAD BECOME USED TO THE DARKNESS IN THE ROOM AND WAS
ABLE TO MAKE OUT VARIOUS FIXTURES AND FITTINGS
HE WAS ESPECIALLY
IMPRESSED BY A LARGE PICTURE HANGING TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR HE LEANT
FORWARD IN ORDER TO SEE IT BETTER
IT DEPICTED A MAN WEARING A JUDGE'S
ROBES HE WAS SITTING ON A LOFTY THRONE GILDED IN A WAY THAT SHONE FORTH
FROM THE PICTURE
THE ODD THING ABOUT THE PICTURE WAS THAT THIS JUDGE
WAS NOT SITTING THERE IN DIGNIFIED CALM BUT HAD HIS LEFT ARM PRESSED
AGAINST THE BACK AND ARMREST HIS RIGHT ARM HOWEVER WAS COMPLETELY
FREE AND ONLY GRASPED THE ARMREST WITH HIS HAND AS IF ABOUT TO JUMP UP
ANY MOMENT IN VIGOROUS OUTRAGE AND MAKE SOME DECISIVE COMMENT OR EVEN TO
PASS SENTENCE
THE ACCUSED WAS PROBABLY MEANT TO BE IMAGINED AT THE
FOOT OF THE STEPS THE TOP ONE OF WHICH COULD BE SEEN IN THE PICTURE
COVERED WITH A YELLOW CARPET
THAT MIGHT BE MY JUDGE SAID K
POINTING TO THE PICTURE WITH ONE FINGER
I KNOW HIM SAID LENI
LOOKING UP AT THE PICTURE HE COMES HERE QUITE OFTEN
THAT PICTURE IS
FROM WHEN HE WAS YOUNG BUT HE CAN NEVER HAVE LOOKED ANYTHING LIKE IT
AS HE'S TINY MINUTE ALMOST
BUT DESPITE THAT HE HAD HIMSELF MADE TO
LOOK BIGGER IN THE PICTURE AS HE'S MADLY VAIN JUST LIKE EVERYONE ROUND
HERE
BUT EVEN I'M VAIN AND THAT MAKES ME VERY UNHAPPY THAT YOU DON'T
LIKE ME K
REPLIED TO THAT LAST COMMENT MERELY BY EMBRACING LENI AND
DRAWING HER TOWARDS HIM SHE LAY HER HEAD QUIETLY ON HIS SHOULDER
TO
THE REST OF IT THOUGH HE SAID WHAT RANK IS HE HE'S AN EXAMINING
JUDGE SHE SAID TAKING HOLD OF THE HAND WITH WHICH K
HELD HER AND
PLAYING WITH HIS FINGERS
JUST AN EXAMINING JUDGE ONCE AGAIN SAID K
IN DISAPPOINTMENT THE SENIOR OFFICIALS KEEP THEMSELVES HIDDEN
BUT
HERE HE IS SITTING ON A THRONE THAT'S ALL JUST MADE UP SAID LENI
WITH HER FACE BENT OVER K 'S HAND REALLY HE'S SITTING ON A KITCHEN
CHAIR WITH AN OLD HORSE BLANKET FOLDED OVER IT
BUT DO YOU HAVE TO BE
ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT YOUR TRIAL SHE ADDED SLOWLY
NO NOT AT ALL
SAID K I PROBABLY EVEN THINK TOO LITTLE ABOUT IT THAT'S NOT THE
MISTAKE YOU'RE MAKING SAID LENI YOU'RE TOO UNYIELDING THAT'S WHAT
I'VE HEARD WHO SAID THAT ASKED K HE FELT HER BODY AGAINST HIS
CHEST AND LOOKED DOWN ON HER RICH DARK TIGHTLY BOUND HAIR
I'D BE
SAYING TOO MUCH IF I TOLD YOU THAT ANSWERED LENI
PLEASE DON'T ASK
FOR NAMES BUT DO STOP MAKING THESE MISTAKES OF YOURS STOP BEING SO
UNYIELDING THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM THIS
COURT YOU HAVE TO CONFESS
SO CONFESS TO THEM AS SOON AS YOU GET THE
CHANCE
IT'S ONLY THEN THAT THEY GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO GET AWAY NOT
TILL THEN
ONLY WITHOUT HELP FROM OUTSIDE EVEN THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT
YOU NEEDN'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING THIS HELP AS I WANT TO HELP YOU MYSELF
YOU UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT THIS COURT AND WHAT SORT OF TRICKS ARE
NEEDED SAID K
AS HE LIFTED HER SINCE SHE WAS PRESSING IN MUCH TOO
CLOSE TO HIM ONTO HIS LAP
THAT'S ALRIGHT THEN SHE SAID AND MADE
HERSELF COMFORTABLE ON HIS LAP BY SMOOTHING OUT HER SKIRT AND ADJUSTING
HER BLOUSE
THEN SHE HUNG BOTH HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK LEANT BACK AND
TOOK A LONG LOOK AT HIM
AND WHAT IF I DON'T CONFESS COULD YOU NOT
HELP ME THEN ASKED K
TO TEST HER OUT
I'M ACCUMULATING WOMEN TO HELP
ME HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF ALMOST IN AMAZEMENT FIRST MISS BRSTNER THEN
THE COURT USHER'S WIFE AND NOW THIS LITTLE CARE ASSISTANT WHO SEEMS TO
HAVE SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE NEED FOR ME
THE WAY SHE SITS ON MY LAP AS
IF IT WERE HER PROPER PLACE NO ANSWERED LENI SLOWLY SHAKING HER
HEAD I COULDN'T HELP YOU THEN
BUT YOU DON'T WANT MY HELP ANYWAY IT
MEANS NOTHING TO YOU YOU'RE TOO STUBBORN AND WON'T BE PERSUADED
THEN AFTER A WHILE SHE ASKED DO YOU HAVE A LOVER NO SAID K
OH YOU MUST HAVE SHE SAID
WELL I HAVE REALLY SAID K
JUST
THINK I'VE EVEN BETRAYED HER WHILE I'M CARRYING HER PHOTOGRAPH WITH
ME LENI INSISTED HE SHOW HER A PHOTOGRAPH OF ELSA AND THEN HUNCHED
ON HIS LAP STUDIED THE PICTURE CLOSELY
THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS NOT ONE
THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN WHILE ELSA WAS POSING FOR IT IT SHOWED HER JUST
AFTER SHE HAD BEEN IN A WILD DANCE SUCH AS SHE LIKED TO DO IN WINE BARS
HER SKIRT WAS STILL FLUNG OUT AS SHE SPAN ROUND SHE HAD PLACED HER
HANDS ON HER FIRM HIPS AND WITH HER NECK HELD TAUT LOOKED TO ONE SIDE
WITH A LAUGH YOU COULD NOT SEE FROM THE PICTURE WHOM HER LAUGH WAS
INTENDED FOR
SHE'S VERY TIGHTLY LACED SAID LENI POINTING TO THE
PLACE WHERE SHE THOUGHT THIS COULD BE SEEN
I DON'T LIKE HER SHE'S
CLUMSY AND CRUDE
BUT MAYBE SHE'S GENTLE AND FRIENDLY TOWARDS YOU
THAT'S THE IMPRESSION YOU GET FROM THE PICTURE
BIG STRONG GIRLS LIKE
THAT OFTEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE ANYTHING BUT GENTLE AND FRIENDLY
WOULD
SHE BE CAPABLE OF SACRIFICING HERSELF FOR YOU THOUGH NO SAID K
SHE ISN'T GENTLE OR FRIENDLY AND NOR WOULD SHE BE CAPABLE OF
SACRIFICING HERSELF FOR ME
BUT I'VE NEVER YET ASKED ANY OF THOSE
THINGS OF HER
I'VE NEVER LOOKED AT THIS PICTURE AS CLOSELY AS YOU
YOU CAN'T THINK MUCH OF HER THEN SAID LENI
SHE CAN'T BE YOUR LOVER
AFTER ALL YES SHE IS SAID K I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE MY WORD BACK
ON THAT WELL SHE MIGHT BE YOUR LOVER NOW THEN SAID LENI BUT YOU
WOULDN'T MISS HER MUCH IF YOU LOST HER OR IF YOU EXCHANGED HER FOR
SOMEBODY ELSE ME FOR INSTANCE THAT IS CERTAINLY CONCEIVABLE SAID
K
WITH A SMILE BUT SHE DOES HAVE ONE MAJOR ADVANTAGE OVER YOU SHE
KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT MY TRIAL AND EVEN IF SHE DID SHE WOULDN'T THINK
ABOUT IT
SHE WOULDN'T TRY TO PERSUADE ME TO BE LESS UNYIELDING WELL
THAT'S NO ADVANTAGE SAID LENI
IF SHE'S GOT NO ADVANTAGE OTHER THAN
THAT I CAN KEEP ON HOPING
HAS SHE GOT ANY BODILY DEFECTS 'BODILY
DEFECTS' ASKED K
YEAH SAID LENI AS I DO HAVE A BODILY DEFECT
JUST A LITTLE ONE
LOOK SHE SPREAD THE MIDDLE AND RING FINGERS OF
HER RIGHT HAND APART FROM EACH OTHER
BETWEEN THOSE FINGERS THE FLAP OF
SKIN CONNECTING THEM REACHED UP ALMOST AS FAR AS THE TOP JOINT OF THE
LITTLE FINGER
IN THE DARKNESS K
DID NOT SEE AT FIRST WHAT IT WAS SHE
WANTED TO SHOW HIM SO SHE LED HIS HAND TO IT SO THAT HE COULD FEEL
WHAT A FREAK OF NATURE SAID K AND WHEN HE HAD TAKEN A LOOK AT THE
WHOLE HAND HE ADDED WHAT A PRETTY CLAW LENI LOOKED ON WITH A KIND
OF PRIDE AS K
REPEATEDLY OPENED AND CLOSED HER TWO FINGERS IN
AMAZEMENT UNTIL FINALLY HE BRIEFLY KISSED THEM AND LET GO
OH SHE
IMMEDIATELY EXCLAIMED YOU KISSED ME HURRIEDLY AND WITH HER MOUTH
OPEN SHE CLAMBERED UP K 'S LAP WITH HER KNEES
HE WAS ALMOST AGHAST AS
HE LOOKED UP AT HER NOW THAT SHE WAS SO CLOSE TO HIM THERE WAS A
BITTER IRRITATING SMELL FROM HER LIKE PEPPER SHE GRASPED HIS HEAD
LEANT OUT OVER HIM AND BIT AND KISSED HIS NECK EVEN BITING INTO HIS
HAIR
I'VE TAKEN HER PLACE SHE EXCLAIMED FROM TIME TO TIME
JUST
LOOK NOW YOU'VE TAKEN ME INSTEAD OF HER JUST THEN HER KNEE SLIPPED
OUT AND WITH A LITTLE CRY SHE NEARLY FELL DOWN ONTO THE CARPET K
TRIED TO HOLD HER BY PUTTING HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND WAS PULLED DOWN
WITH HER
NOW YOU'RE MINE SHE SAID
HER LAST WORDS TO HIM AS HE
LEFT WERE HERE'S THE KEY TO THE DOOR COME WHENEVER YOU WANT AND SHE
PLANTED AN UNDIRECTED KISS ON HIS BACK
WHEN HE STEPPED OUT THE FRONT
DOOR THERE WAS A LIGHT RAIN FALLING HE WAS ABOUT TO GO TO THE MIDDLE OF
THE STREET TO SEE IF HE COULD STILL GLIMPSE LENI AT THE WINDOW WHEN K 'S
UNCLE LEAPT OUT OF A CAR THAT K THINKING OF OTHER THINGS HAD NOT SEEN
WAITING OUTSIDE THE BUILDING
HE TOOK HOLD OF K
BY BOTH ARMS AND
SHOVED HIM AGAINST THE DOOR AS IF HE WANTED TO NAIL HIM TO IT
YOUNG
MAN HE SHOUTED HOW COULD YOU DO A THING LIKE THAT THINGS WERE
GOING WELL WITH THIS BUSINESS OF YOURS NOW YOU'VE CAUSED IT TERRIBLE
DAMAGE
YOU SLIP OFF WITH SOME DIRTY LITTLE THING WHO MOREOVER IS
OBVIOUSLY THE LAWYER'S BELOVED AND STAY AWAY FOR HOURS
YOU DON'T EVEN
TRY TO FIND AN EXCUSE DON'T TRY TO HIDE ANYTHING NO YOU'RE QUITE OPEN
ABOUT IT YOU RUN OFF WITH HER AND STAY THERE
AND MEANWHILE WE'RE
SITTING THERE YOUR UNCLE WHO'S GOING TO SUCH EFFORT FOR YOU THE LAWYER
WHO NEEDS TO BE WON OVER TO YOUR SIDE AND ABOVE ALL THE OFFICE
DIRECTOR A VERY IMPORTANT GENTLEMAN WHO IS IN DIRECT COMMAND OF YOUR
AFFAIR IN ITS PRESENT STAGE
WE WANTED TO DISCUSS HOW BEST TO HELP YOU
I HAD TO HANDLE THE LAWYER VERY CAREFULLY HE HAD TO HANDLE THE OFFICE
DIRECTOR CAREFULLY AND YOU HAD MOST REASON OF ALL TO AT LEAST GIVE ME
SOME SUPPORT
INSTEAD OF WHICH YOU STAY AWAY
EVENTUALLY WE COULDN'T
KEEP UP THE PRETENCE ANY LONGER BUT THESE ARE POLITE AND HIGHLY CAPABLE
MEN THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO AS TO SPARE MY FEELINGS BUT IN
THE END NOT EVEN THEY COULD CONTINUE TO FORCE THEMSELVES AND AS THEY
COULDN'T SPEAK ABOUT THE MATTER IN HAND THEY BECAME SILENT
WE SAT
THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES LISTENING TO SEE WHETHER YOU WOULDN'T FINALLY
COME BACK
ALL IN VAIN
IN THE END THE OFFICE DIRECTOR STOOD UP AS HE
HAD STAYED FAR LONGER THAN HE HAD ORIGINALLY INTENDED MADE HIS
FAREWELL LOOKED AT ME IN SYMPATHY WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO HELP HE WAITED
AT THE DOOR FOR A LONG TIME ALTHOUGH IT'S MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY
HE WAS BEING SO GOOD AND THEN HE WENT
I OF COURSE WAS GLAD HE'D
GONE I'D BEEN HOLDING MY BREATH ALL THIS TIME
ALL THIS HAD EVEN MORE
AFFECT ON THE LAWYER LYING THERE ILL WHEN I TOOK MY LEAVE OF HIM THE
GOOD MAN HE WAS QUITE UNABLE TO SPEAK
YOU HAVE PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED
TO HIS TOTAL COLLAPSE AND SO BROUGHT THE VERY MAN WHO YOU ARE DEPENDENT
ON CLOSER TO HIS DEATH
AND ME YOUR OWN UNCLE YOU LEAVE ME HERE IN
THE RAIN JUST FEEL THIS I'M WET RIGHT THROUGH WAITING HERE FOR
HOURS SICK WITH WORRY
CHAPTER SEVEN
LAWYER MANUFACTURER PAINTER
ONE WINTER MORNING SNOW WAS FALLING IN THE DULL LIGHT OUTSIDE
K
WAS SITTING IN HIS OFFICE ALREADY EXTREMELY TIRED DESPITE THE EARLY
HOUR
HE HAD TOLD THE SERVITOR HE WAS ENGAGED IN A MAJOR PIECE OF WORK
AND NONE OF THE JUNIOR STAFF SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN TO SEE HIM SO HE
WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY THEM AT LEAST
BUT INSTEAD OF WORKING HE
TURNED ROUND IN HIS CHAIR SLOWLY MOVED VARIOUS ITEMS AROUND HIS DESK
BUT THEN WITHOUT BEING AWARE OF IT HE LAY HIS ARM STRETCHED OUT ON THE
DESK TOP AND SAT THERE IMMOBILE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK DOWN ON HIS CHEST
HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO GET THE THOUGHT OF THE TRIAL OUT OF HIS
HEAD
HE HAD OFTEN WONDERED WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA TO WORK
OUT A WRITTEN DEFENCE AND HAND IT IN TO THE COURT
IT WOULD CONTAIN A
SHORT DESCRIPTION OF HIS LIFE AND EXPLAIN WHY HE HAD ACTED THE WAY HE
HAD AT EACH EVENT THAT WAS IN ANY WAY IMPORTANT WHETHER HE NOW
CONSIDERED HE HAD ACTED WELL OR ILL AND HIS REASONS FOR EACH
THERE
WAS NO DOUBT OF THE ADVANTAGES A WRITTEN DEFENCE OF THIS SORT WOULD HAVE
OVER RELYING ON THE LAWYER WHO WAS ANYWAY NOT WITHOUT HIS SHORTCOMINGS
K
HAD NO IDEA WHAT ACTIONS THE LAWYER WAS TAKING IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT
A LOT IT WAS MORE THAN A MONTH SINCE THE LAWYER HAD SUMMONED HIM AND
NONE OF THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS HAD GIVEN K
THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS
MAN WOULD BE ABLE TO DO MUCH FOR HIM
MOST IMPORTANTLY HE HAD ASKED
HIM HARDLY ANY QUESTIONS
AND THERE WERE SO MANY QUESTIONS HERE TO BE
ASKED
ASKING QUESTIONS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
K
HAD THE
FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS NEEDED HERE
HIMSELF
THE LAWYER IN CONTRAST DID NOT ASK QUESTIONS BUT DID ALL THE
TALKING HIMSELF OR SAT SILENTLY FACING HIM LEANT FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER
THE DESK PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WAS HARD OF HEARING PULLED ON A STRAND OF
HAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS BEARD AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE CARPET PERHAPS
AT THE VERY SPOT WHERE K
HAD LAIN WITH LENI
NOW AND THEN HE WOULD
GIVE K
SOME VAGUE WARNING OF THE SORT YOU GIVE TO CHILDREN
HIS
SPEECHES WERE AS POINTLESS AS THEY WERE BORING AND K
DECIDED THAT WHEN
THE FINAL BILL CAME HE WOULD PAY NOT A PENNY FOR THEM
ONCE THE LAWYER
THOUGHT HE HAD HUMILIATED K
SUFFICIENTLY HE USUALLY STARTED SOMETHING
THAT WOULD RAISE HIS SPIRITS AGAIN
HE HAD ALREADY HE WOULD THEN SAY
WON MANY SUCH CASES PARTLY OR IN WHOLE CASES WHICH MAY NOT REALLY HAVE
BEEN AS DIFFICULT AS THIS ONE BUT WHICH ON THE FACE OF IT HAD EVEN
LESS HOPE OF SUCCESS
HE HAD A LIST OF THESE CASES HERE IN THE DRAWER
HERE HE WOULD TAP ON ONE OR OTHER OF THE DRAWERS IN HIS DESK BUT
COULD UNFORTUNATELY NOT SHOW THEM TO K
AS THEY DEALT WITH OFFICIAL
SECRETS
NONETHELESS THE GREAT EXPERIENCE HE HAD ACQUIRED THROUGH ALL
THESE CASES WOULD OF COURSE BE OF BENEFIT TO K
HE HAD OF COURSE
BEGUN WORK STRAIGHT AWAY AND WAS NEARLY READY TO SUBMIT THE FIRST
DOCUMENTS
THEY WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE FIRST IMPRESSION
MADE BY THE DEFENCE WILL OFTEN DETERMINE THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE
PROCEEDINGS
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH HE WOULD STILL HAVE TO MAKE IT
CLEAR TO K
THAT THE FIRST DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED ARE SOMETIMES NOT EVEN
READ BY THE COURT
THEY SIMPLY PUT THEM WITH THE OTHER DOCUMENTS AND
POINT OUT THAT FOR THE TIME BEING QUESTIONING AND OBSERVING THE
ACCUSED ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING WRITTEN
IF THE APPLICANT
BECOMES INSISTENT THEN THEY ADD THAT BEFORE THEY COME TO ANY DECISION
AS SOON AS ALL THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH DUE REGARD
OF COURSE TO ALL THE DOCUMENTS THEN THESE FIRST DOCUMENTS TO HAVE BEEN
SUBMITTED WILL ALSO BE CHECKED OVER
BUT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THIS IS
NOT USUALLY TRUE THE FIRST DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED ARE USUALLY MISLAID OR
LOST COMPLETELY AND EVEN IF THEY DO KEEP THEM RIGHT TO THE END THEY ARE
HARDLY READ ALTHOUGH THE LAWYER ONLY KNEW ABOUT THIS FROM RUMOUR
THIS
IS ALL VERY REGRETTABLE BUT NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT ITS JUSTIFICATIONS
BUT K
SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT THE TRIAL WOULD NOT BE PUBLIC IF THE
COURT DEEMS IT NECESSARY IT CAN BE MADE PUBLIC BUT THERE IS NO LAW THAT
SAYS IT HAS TO BE
AS A RESULT THE ACCUSED AND HIS DEFENCE DON'T HAVE
ACCESS EVEN TO THE COURT RECORDS AND ESPECIALLY NOT TO THE INDICTMENT
AND THAT MEANS WE GENERALLY DON'T KNOW OR AT LEAST NOT PRECISELY
WHAT THE FIRST DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE ABOUT WHICH MEANS THAT IF THEY DO
CONTAIN ANYTHING OF RELEVANCE TO THE CASE IT'S ONLY BY A LUCKY
COINCIDENCE
IF ANYTHING ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CHARGES AND THE REASONS
FOR THEM COMES OUT CLEARLY OR CAN BE GUESSED AT WHILE THE ACCUSED IS
BEING QUESTIONED THEN IT'S POSSIBLE TO WORK OUT AND SUBMIT DOCUMENTS
THAT REALLY DIRECT THE ISSUE AND PRESENT PROOF BUT NOT BEFORE
CONDITIONS LIKE THIS OF COURSE PLACE THE DEFENCE IN A VERY
UNFAVOURABLE AND DIFFICULT POSITION
BUT THAT IS WHAT THEY INTEND
IN
FACT DEFENCE IS NOT REALLY ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW IT'S ONLY TOLERATED
AND THERE IS EVEN SOME DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER THE RELEVANT PARTS OF THE
LAW IMPLY EVEN THAT
SO STRICTLY SPEAKING THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A
COUNSEL ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE COURT AND ANYONE WHO COMES BEFORE THIS
COURT AS COUNSEL IS BASICALLY NO MORE THAN A BARRACK ROOM LAWYER
THE
EFFECT OF ALL THIS OF COURSE IS TO REMOVE THE DIGNITY OF THE WHOLE
PROCEDURE THE NEXT TIME K
IS IN THE COURT OFFICES HE MIGHT LIKE TO
HAVE A LOOK IN AT THE LAWYERS' ROOM JUST SO THAT HE'S SEEN IT
HE
MIGHT WELL BE QUITE SHOCKED BY THE PEOPLE HE SEES ASSEMBLED THERE
THE
ROOM THEY'VE BEEN ALLOCATED WITH ITS NARROW SPACE AND LOW CEILING WILL
BE ENOUGH TO SHOW WHAT CONTEMPT THE COURT HAS FOR THESE PEOPLE
THE
ONLY LIGHT IN THE ROOM COMES THROUGH A LITTLE WINDOW THAT IS SO HIGH UP
THAT IF YOU WANT TO LOOK OUT OF IT YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET ONE OF YOUR
COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT YOU ON HIS BACK AND EVEN THEN THE SMOKE FROM THE
CHIMNEY JUST IN FRONT OF IT WILL GO UP YOUR NOSE AND MAKE YOUR FACE
BLACK
IN THE FLOOR OF THIS ROOM TO GIVE YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE
CONDITIONS THERE THERE IS A HOLE THAT'S BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN A
YEAR IT'S NOT SO BIG THAT A MAN COULD FALL THROUGH BUT IT IS BIG
ENOUGH FOR YOUR FOOT TO DISAPPEAR THROUGH IT
THE LAWYERS' ROOM IS ON
THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE ATTIC IF YOUR FOOT DOES GO THROUGH IT WILL HANG
DOWN INTO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE ATTIC UNDERNEATH IT AND RIGHT IN THE
CORRIDOR WHERE THE LITIGANTS ARE WAITING
IT'S NO EXAGGERATION WHEN
LAWYERS SAY THAT CONDITIONS LIKE THAT ARE A DISGRACE
COMPLAINTS TO THE
MANAGEMENT DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT BUT THE LAWYERS ARE STRICTLY
FORBIDDEN TO ALTER ANYTHING IN THE ROOM AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE
BUT EVEN
TREATING THE LAWYERS IN THIS WAY HAS ITS REASONS
THEY WANT AS FAR AS
POSSIBLE TO PREVENT ANY KIND OF DEFENCE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE MADE THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ACCUSED
NOT A BAD POINT OF VIEW BASICALLY BUT
NOTHING COULD BE MORE MISTAKEN THAN TO THINK FROM THAT THAT LAWYERS ARE
NOT NECESSARY FOR THE ACCUSED IN THIS COURT
ON THE CONTRARY THERE IS
NO COURT WHERE THEY ARE LESS NEEDED THAN HERE
THIS IS BECAUSE
PROCEEDINGS ARE GENERALLY KEPT SECRET NOT ONLY FROM THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO
FROM THE ACCUSED
ONLY AS FAR AS THAT IS POSSIBLE OF COURSE BUT IT IS
POSSIBLE TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT
AND THE ACCUSED DOESN'T GET TO SEE THE
COURT RECORDS EITHER AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO INFER WHAT'S IN THE
COURT RECORDS FROM WHAT'S BEEN SAID DURING QUESTIONING BASED ON THEM
ESPECIALLY FOR THE ACCUSED WHO IS IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION AND IS FACED
WITH EVERY POSSIBLE WORRY TO DISTRACT HIM
THIS IS WHEN THE DEFENCE
BEGINS
COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE ARE NOT NORMALLY ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT
WHILE THE ACCUSED IS BEING QUESTIONED SO AFTERWARDS AND IF POSSIBLE
STILL AT THE DOOR OF THE INTERVIEW ROOM HE HAS TO LEARN WHAT HE CAN
ABOUT IT FROM HIM AND EXTRACT WHATEVER HE CAN THAT MIGHT BE OF USE EVEN
THOUGH WHAT THE ACCUSED HAS TO REPORT IS OFTEN VERY CONFUSED
BUT THAT
IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AS THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT THAT CAN BE
LEARNED IN THIS WAY ALTHOUGH IN THIS AS WITH ANYTHING ELSE A
COMPETENT MAN WILL LEARN MORE THAN ANOTHER
NONETHELESS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS THE LAWYER'S PERSONAL CONNECTIONS THAT'S WHERE THE
REAL VALUE OF TAKING COUNSEL LIES
NOW K
WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE ALREADY
LEARNED FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCE THAT AMONG ITS VERY LOWEST ORDERS THE
COURT ORGANISATION DOES HAVE ITS IMPERFECTIONS THE COURT IS STRICTLY
CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC BUT STAFF WHO FORGET THEIR DUTY OR WHO TAKE BRIBES
DO TO SOME EXTENT SHOW WHERE THE GAPS ARE
THIS IS WHERE MOST LAWYERS
WILL PUSH THEIR WAY IN THIS IS WHERE BRIBES ARE PAID AND INFORMATION
EXTRACTED THERE HAVE EVEN IN EARLIER TIMES AT LEAST BEEN INCIDENTS
WHERE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN STOLEN
THERE'S NO DENYING THAT SOME
SURPRISINGLY FAVOURABLE RESULTS HAVE BEEN ATTAINED FOR THE ACCUSED IN
THIS WAY FOR A LIMITED TIME AND THESE PETTY ADVOCATES THEN STRUT TO
AND FRO ON THE BASIS OF THEM AND ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS BUT FOR THE
FURTHER COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS IT SIGNIFIES EITHER NOTHING OR NOTHING
GOOD
THE ONLY THINGS OF REAL VALUE ARE HONEST PERSONAL CONTACTS
CONTACTS WITH HIGHER OFFICIALS ALBEIT HIGHER OFFICIALS OF THE LOWER
GRADES YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THE PROGRESS OF THE TRIAL
CAN BE INFLUENCED HARDLY NOTICEABLE AT FIRST IT'S TRUE BUT FROM THEN
ON IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE VISIBLE
THERE ARE OF COURSE NOT MANY
LAWYERS WHO CAN DO THIS AND K
HAS MADE A VERY GOOD CHOICE IN THIS
MATTER
THERE WERE PROBABLY NO MORE THAN ONE OR TWO WHO HAD AS MANY
CONTACTS AS DR
HULD BUT THEY DON'T BOTHER WITH THE COMPANY OF THE
LAWYERS' ROOM AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
THIS MEANS THEY HAVE ALL
THE LESS CONTACT WITH THE COURT OFFICIALS
IT IS NOT AT ALL NECESSARY
FOR DR
HULD TO GO TO THE COURT WAIT IN THE ANTE ROOMS FOR THE
EXAMINING JUDGES TO TURN UP IF THEY TURN UP AND TRY TO ACHIEVE
SOMETHING WHICH ACCORDING TO THE JUDGES' MOOD IS USUALLY MORE APPARENT
THAN REAL AND MOST OFTEN NOT EVEN THAT
NO K
HAS SEEN FOR HIMSELF
THAT THE COURT OFFICIALS INCLUDING SOME WHO ARE QUITE HIGH UP COME
FORWARD WITHOUT BEING ASKED ARE GLAD TO GIVE INFORMATION WHICH IS FULLY
OPEN OR AT LEAST EASY TO UNDERSTAND THEY DISCUSS THE NEXT STAGES IN THE
PROCEEDINGS IN FACT IN SOME CASES THEY CAN BE WON OVER AND ARE QUITE
WILLING TO ADOPT THE OTHER PERSON'S POINT OF VIEW
HOWEVER WHEN THIS
HAPPENS YOU SHOULD NEVER TRUST THEM TOO FAR AS HOWEVER FIRMLY THEY MAY
HAVE DECLARED THIS NEW POINT OF VIEW IN FAVOUR OF THE DEFENDANT THEY
MIGHT WELL GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THEIR OFFICES AND WRITE A REPORT FOR THE
COURT THAT SAYS JUST THE OPPOSITE AND MIGHT WELL BE EVEN HARDER ON THE
DEFENDANT THAN THE ORIGINAL VIEW THE ONE THEY INSIST THEY'VE BEEN FULLY
DISSUADED FROM
AND OF COURSE THERE'S NO WAY OF DEFENDING YOURSELF
FROM THIS SOMETHING SAID IN PRIVATE IS INDEED IN PRIVATE AND CANNOT
THEN BE USED IN PUBLIC IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MAKES IT EASY FOR THE
DEFENCE TO KEEP THOSE GENTLEMEN'S FAVOUR
ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S ALSO
TRUE THAT THE GENTLEMEN DON'T BECOME INVOLVED WITH THE DEFENCE WHICH
WILL OF COURSE BE DONE WITH GREAT EXPERTISE JUST FOR PHILANTHROPIC
REASONS OR IN ORDER TO BE FRIENDLY IN SOME RESPECTS IT WOULD BE TRUER
TO SAY THAT THEY TOO HAVE IT ALLOCATED TO THEM
THIS IS WHERE THE
DISADVANTAGES OF A COURT STRUCTURE THAT RIGHT FROM THE START
STIPULATES THAT ALL PROCEEDINGS TAKE PLACE IN PRIVATE COME INTO FORCE
IN NORMAL MEDIOCRE TRIALS ITS OFFICIALS HAVE CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC
AND THEY'RE VERY WELL EQUIPPED FOR IT BUT HERE THEY DON'T NORMAL
TRIALS RUN THEIR COURSE ALL BY THEMSELVES ALMOST AND JUST NEED A NUDGE
HERE AND THERE BUT WHEN THEY'RE FACED WITH CASES THAT ARE ESPECIALLY
DIFFICULT THEY'RE AS LOST AS THEY OFTEN ARE WITH ONES THAT ARE VERY
SIMPLE THEY'RE FORCED TO SPEND ALL THEIR TIME DAY AND NIGHT WITH
THEIR LAWS AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT FEEL FOR HUMAN
RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT'S A SERIOUS SHORTCOMING IN CASES LIKE THIS
THAT'S WHEN THEY COME FOR ADVICE TO THE LAWYER WITH A SERVANT BEHIND
THEM CARRYING THE DOCUMENTS WHICH NORMALLY ARE KEPT SO SECRET
YOU
COULD HAVE SEEN MANY GENTLEMEN AT THIS WINDOW GENTLEMEN OF WHOM YOU
WOULD LEAST EXPECT IT STARING OUT THIS WINDOW IN DESPAIR ON THE STREET
BELOW WHILE THE LAWYER IS AT HIS DESK STUDYING THE DOCUMENTS SO THAT HE
CAN GIVE THEM GOOD ADVICE
AND AT TIMES LIKE THAT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO
SEE HOW EXCEPTIONALLY SERIOUSLY THESE GENTLEMEN TAKE THEIR PROFESSIONS
AND HOW THEY ARE THROWN INTO GREAT CONFUSION BY DIFFICULTIES WHICH IT'S
JUST NOT IN THEIR NATURES TO OVERCOME
BUT THEY'RE NOT IN AN EASY
POSITION TO REGARD THEIR POSITIONS AS EASY WOULD BE TO DO THEM AN
INJUSTICE
THE DIFFERENT RANKS AND HIERARCHIES OF THE COURT ARE
ENDLESS AND EVEN SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND THEM CANNOT ALWAYS
TELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
BUT EVEN FOR THE JUNIOR OFFICIALS THE
PROCEEDINGS IN THE COURTROOMS ARE USUALLY KEPT SECRET SO THEY ARE
HARDLY ABLE TO SEE HOW THE CASES THEY WORK WITH PROCEED COURT AFFAIRS
APPEAR IN THEIR RANGE OF VISION OFTEN WITHOUT THEIR KNOWING WHERE THEY
COME FROM AND THEY MOVE ON FURTHER WITHOUT THEIR LEARNING WHERE THEY GO
SO CIVIL SERVANTS LIKE THIS ARE NOT ABLE TO LEARN THE THINGS YOU CAN
LEARN FROM STUDYING THE SUCCESSIVE STAGES THAT INDIVIDUAL TRIALS GO
THROUGH THE FINAL VERDICT OR THE REASONS FOR IT
THEY'RE ONLY ALLOWED
TO DEAL WITH THAT PART OF THE TRIAL WHICH THE LAW ALLOCATES THEM AND
THEY USUALLY KNOW LESS ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THEIR WORK AFTER IT'S LEFT
THEM THAN THE DEFENCE DOES EVEN THOUGH THE DEFENCE WILL USUALLY STAY IN
CONTACT WITH THE ACCUSED UNTIL THE TRIAL IS NEARLY AT ITS END SO THAT
THE COURT OFFICIALS CAN LEARN MANY USEFUL THINGS FROM THE DEFENCE
BEARING ALL THIS IN MIND DOES IT STILL SURPRISE K
THAT THE OFFICIALS
ARE IRRITATED AND OFTEN EXPRESS THEMSELVES ABOUT THE LITIGANTS IN
UNFLATTERING WAYS WHICH IS AN EXPERIENCE SHARED BY EVERYONE
ALL THE
OFFICIALS ARE IRRITATED EVEN WHEN THEY APPEAR CALM
THIS CAUSES MANY
DIFFICULTIES FOR THE JUNIOR ADVOCATES OF COURSE
THERE IS A STORY FOR
INSTANCE THAT HAS VERY MUCH THE RING OF TRUTH ABOUT IT
IT GOES LIKE
THIS ONE OF THE OLDER OFFICIALS A GOOD AND PEACEFUL MAN WAS DEALING
WITH A DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THE COURT WHICH HAD BECOME VERY CONFUSED
ESPECIALLY THANKS TO THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE LAWYERS
HE HAD BEEN
STUDYING IT FOR A DAY AND A NIGHT WITHOUT A BREAK AS THESE OFFICIALS
ARE INDEED HARD WORKING NO ONE WORKS AS HARD AS THEY DO
WHEN IT WAS
NEARLY MORNING AND HE HAD BEEN WORKING FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITH
PROBABLY VERY LITTLE RESULT HE WENT TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE WAITED THERE
IN AMBUSH AND EVERY TIME A LAWYER TRIED TO ENTER THE BUILDING HE WOULD
THROW HIM DOWN THE STEPS
THE LAWYERS GATHERED TOGETHER DOWN IN FRONT
OF THE STEPS AND DISCUSSED WITH EACH OTHER WHAT THEY SHOULD DO ON THE
ONE HAND THEY HAD ACTUALLY NO RIGHT TO BE ALLOWED INTO THE BUILDING SO
THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD LEGALLY DO TO THE
OFFICIAL AND AS I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
NOT TO SET ALL THE OFFICIALS AGAINST THEM
ON THE OTHER HAND ANY DAY
NOT SPENT IN COURT IS A DAY LOST FOR THEM AND IT WAS A MATTER OF SOME
IMPORTANCE TO FORCE THEIR WAY INSIDE
IN THE END THEY AGREED THAT THEY
WOULD TRY TO TIRE THE OLD MAN OUT
ONE LAWYER AFTER ANOTHER WAS SENT
OUT TO RUN UP THE STEPS AND LET HIMSELF BE THROWN DOWN AGAIN OFFERING
WHAT RESISTANCE HE COULD AS LONG AS IT WAS PASSIVE RESISTANCE AND HIS
COLLEAGUES WOULD CATCH HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS
THAT WENT ON FOR
ABOUT AN HOUR UNTIL THE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ALREADY EXHAUSTED FROM
WORKING ALL NIGHT WAS VERY TIRED AND WENT BACK TO HIS OFFICE
THOSE
WHO WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS COULD NOT BELIEVE IT AT FIRST SO
THEY SENT SOMEBODY OUT TO GO AND LOOK BEHIND THE DOOR TO SEE IF THERE
REALLY WAS NO ONE THERE AND ONLY THEN DID THEY ALL GATHER TOGETHER AND
PROBABLY DIDN'T EVEN DARE TO COMPLAIN AS IT'S FAR FROM BEING THE
LAWYERS' JOB TO INTRODUCE ANY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COURT SYSTEM OR EVEN
TO WANT TO
EVEN THE MOST JUNIOR LAWYER CAN UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP
THERE TO SOME EXTENT BUT ONE SIGNIFICANT POINT IS THAT ALMOST EVERY
DEFENDANT EVEN VERY SIMPLE PEOPLE BEGINS TO THINK OF SUGGESTIONS FOR
IMPROVING THE COURT AS SOON AS HIS PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEGUN MANY OF THEM
OFTEN EVEN SPEND TIME AND ENERGY ON THE MATTER THAT COULD BE SPENT FAR
BETTER ELSEWHERE
THE ONLY RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL
WITH THE SITUATION AS IT IS
EVEN IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE ANY
DETAIL OF IT WHICH IS ANYWAY NO MORE THAN SUPERSTITIOUS NONSENSE THE
BEST THAT THEY COULD ACHIEVE ALTHOUGH DOING THEMSELVES INCALCULABLE
HARM IN THE PROCESS IS THAT THEY WILL HAVE ATTRACTED THE SPECIAL
ATTENTION OF THE OFFICIALS FOR ANY CASE THAT COMES UP IN THE FUTURE AND
THE OFFICIALS ARE ALWAYS READY TO SEEK REVENGE
NEVER ATTRACT ATTENTION
TO YOURSELF STAY CALM HOWEVER MUCH IT GOES AGAINST YOUR CHARACTER
TRY TO GAIN SOME INSIGHT INTO THE SIZE OF THE COURT ORGANISM AND HOW TO
SOME EXTENT IT REMAINS IN A STATE OF SUSPENSION AND THAT EVEN IF YOU
ALTER SOMETHING IN ONE PLACE YOU'LL DRAW THE GROUND OUT FROM UNDER YOUR
FEET AND MIGHT FALL WHEREAS IF AN ENORMOUS ORGANISM LIKE THE COURT IS
DISRUPTED IN ANY ONE PLACE IT FINDS IT EASY TO PROVIDE A SUBSTITUTE FOR
ITSELF SOMEWHERE ELSE
EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AND
WILL CONTINUE WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OR ELSE WHICH IS QUITE PROBABLE EVEN
MORE CLOSED MORE ATTENTIVE MORE STRICT MORE MALEVOLENT
SO IT'S BEST
TO LEAVE THE WORK TO THE LAWYERS AND NOT TO KEEP DISTURBING THEM
IT
DOESN'T DO MUCH GOOD TO MAKE ACCUSATIONS ESPECIALLY IF YOU CAN'T MAKE
IT CLEAR WHAT THEY'RE BASED ON AND THEIR FULL SIGNIFICANCE BUT IT MUST
BE SAID THAT K
CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF HARM TO HIS OWN CASE BY HIS
BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS THE OFFICE DIRECTOR HE WAS A VERY INFLUENTIAL MAN BUT
NOW HE MIGHT AS WELL BE STRUCK OFF THE LIST OF THOSE WHO MIGHT DO
ANYTHING FOR K
IF THE TRIAL IS MENTIONED EVEN JUST IN PASSING IT'S
QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HE'S IGNORING IT
THESE OFFICIALS ARE IN MANY WAYS
JUST LIKE CHILDREN
OFTEN SOMETHING QUITE HARMLESS ALTHOUGH K 'S
BEHAVIOUR COULD UNFORTUNATELY NOT BE CALLED HARMLESS WILL LEAVE THEM
FEELING SO OFFENDED THAT THEY WILL EVEN STOP TALKING WITH GOOD FRIENDS
OF THEIRS THEY TURN AWAY WHEN THEY SEE THEM AND DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN
TO OPPOSE THEM
BUT THEN WITH NO PARTICULAR REASON SURPRISINGLY
ENOUGH SOME LITTLE JOKE THAT WAS ONLY EVER ATTEMPTED BECAUSE EVERYTHING
SEEMED SO HOPELESS WILL MAKE THEM LAUGH AND THEY'LL BE RECONCILED
IT'S BOTH DIFFICULT AND HARD AT THE SAME TIME TO DEAL WITH THEM AND
THERE'S HARDLY ANY REASON FOR IT
IT'S SOMETIMES QUITE ASTONISHING THAT
A SINGLE AVERAGE LIFE IS ENOUGH TO ENCOMPASS SO MUCH THAT IT'S AT ALL
POSSIBLE EVER TO HAVE ANY SUCCESS IN ONE'S WORK HERE
ON THE OTHER
HAND THERE ARE ALSO DARK MOMENTS SUCH AS EVERYONE HAS WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'VE ACHIEVED NOTHING AT ALL WHEN IT SEEMS THAT THE ONLY TRIALS TO
COME TO A GOOD END ARE THOSE THAT WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE A GOOD END
FROM THE START AND WOULD DO SO WITHOUT ANY HELP WHILE ALL THE OTHERS
ARE LOST DESPITE ALL THE RUNNING TO AND FRO ALL THE EFFORT ALL THE
LITTLE APPARENT SUCCESSES THAT GAVE SUCH JOY
THEN YOU NO LONGER FEEL
VERY SURE OF ANYTHING AND IF ASKED ABOUT A TRIAL THAT WAS DOING WELL BY
ITS OWN NATURE BUT WHICH WAS TURNED FOR THE WORSE BECAUSE YOU ASSISTED
IN IT WOULD NOT EVEN DARE DENY THAT
AND EVEN THAT IS A KIND OF SELF
CONFIDENCE BUT THEN IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT'S LEFT
LAWYERS ARE
ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO FITS OF DEPRESSION OF THAT SORT AND THEY ARE
NO MORE THAN FITS OF DEPRESSION OF COURSE WHEN A CASE IS SUDDENLY
TAKEN OUT OF THEIR HANDS AFTER THEY'VE BEEN CONDUCTING IT SATISFACTORILY
FOR SOME TIME
THAT'S PROBABLY THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A LAWYER
IT'S NOT THAT THE ACCUSED TAKES THE CASE AWAY FROM HIM THAT HARDLY EVER
HAPPENS ONCE A DEFENDANT HAS TAKEN ON A CERTAIN LAWYER HE HAS TO STAY
WITH HIM WHATEVER HAPPENS
HOW COULD HE EVER CARRY ON BY HIMSELF AFTER
HE'S TAKEN ON HELP FROM A LAWYER NO THAT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT
WHAT DOES SOMETIMES HAPPEN IS THAT THE TRIAL TAKES ON A COURSE WHERE THE
LAWYER MAY NOT GO ALONG WITH IT
CLIENT AND TRIAL ARE BOTH SIMPLY TAKEN
AWAY FROM THE LAWYER AND THEN EVEN CONTACT WITH THE COURT OFFICIALS
WON'T HELP HOWEVER GOOD THEY ARE AS THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
THEMSELVES
THE TRIAL WILL HAVE ENTERED A STAGE WHERE NO MORE HELP CAN
BE GIVEN WHERE IT'S BEING PROCESSED IN COURTS TO WHICH NO ONE HAS ANY
ACCESS WHERE THE DEFENDANT CANNOT EVEN BE CONTACTED BY HIS LAWYER
YOU
COME HOME ONE DAY AND FIND ALL THE DOCUMENTS YOU'VE SUBMITTED WHICH
YOU'VE WORKED HARD TO CREATE AND WHICH YOU HAD THE BEST HOPES FOR LYING
ON THE DESK THEY'VE BEEN SENT BACK AS THEY CAN'T BE CARRIED THROUGH TO
THE NEXT STAGE IN THE TRIAL THEY'RE JUST WORTHLESS SCRAPS OF PAPER
IT
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE CASE HAS BEEN LOST NOT AT ALL OR AT LEAST THERE
IS NO DECISIVE REASON FOR SUPPOSING SO IT'S JUST THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE CASE AND WON'T BE TOLD ANYTHING OF WHAT'S
HAPPENING
WELL CASES LIKE THAT ARE THE EXCEPTIONS I'M GLAD TO SAY
AND EVEN IF K 'S TRIAL IS ONE OF THEM IT'S STILL FOR THE TIME BEING A
LONG WAY OFF
BUT THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR LAWYERS TO
GET TO WORK AND K
COULD BE SURE THEY WOULD BE MADE USE OF
AS HE HAD
SAID THE TIME FOR SUBMITTING DOCUMENTS WAS STILL IN THE FUTURE AND
THERE WAS NO RUSH TO PREPARE THEM IT WAS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO START
THE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS AND THEY HAD
ALREADY TAKEN PLACE
WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS IT MUST BE SAID
IT WAS MUCH BETTER NOT TO GIVE AWAY ANY DETAILS BEFORE THEIR TIME AS IN
THAT WAY K
COULD ONLY BE INFLUENCED UNFAVOURABLY AND HIS HOPES MIGHT BE
RAISED OR HE MIGHT BE MADE TOO ANXIOUS BETTER JUST TO SAY THAT SOME
INDIVIDUALS HAVE SPOKEN VERY FAVOURABLY AND SHOWN THEMSELVES VERY
WILLING TO HELP ALTHOUGH OTHERS HAVE SPOKEN LESS FAVOURABLY BUT EVEN
THEY HAVE NOT IN ANY WAY REFUSED TO HELP
SO ALL IN ALL THE RESULTS
ARE VERY ENCOURAGING ONLY YOU SHOULD CERTAINLY NOT DRAW ANY PARTICULAR
CONCLUSIONS AS ALL PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS BEGIN IN THE SAME WAY AND IT
WAS ONLY THE WAY THEY DEVELOPED FURTHER THAT WOULD SHOW WHAT THE VALUE
OF THESE PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS HAS BEEN
ANYWAY NOTHING HAS BEEN
LOST YET AND IF WE CAN SUCCEED IN GETTING THE OFFICE DIRECTOR DESPITE
EVERYTHING ON OUR SIDE AND SEVERAL ACTIONS HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO
THIS END THEN EVERYTHING IS A CLEAN WOUND AS A SURGEON WOULD SAY AND
WE CAN WAIT FOR THE RESULTS WITH SOME COMFORT
WHEN HE STARTED TALKING ON IN THIS WAY THE LAWYER WAS QUITE
TIRELESS
HE WENT THROUGH IT ALL AGAIN EVERY TIME K
WENT TO SEE HIM
THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME PROGRESS BUT HE COULD NEVER BE TOLD WHAT SORT OF
PROGRESS IT WAS
THE FIRST SET OF DOCUMENTS TO BE SUBMITTED WERE BEING
WORKED ON BUT STILL NOT READY WHICH USUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT
ADVANTAGE THE NEXT TIME K
WENT TO SEE HIM AS THE EARLIER OCCASION WOULD
HAVE BEEN A VERY BAD TIME TO PUT THEM IN WHICH THEY COULD NOT THEN HAVE
KNOWN
IF K STUPEFIED FROM ALL THIS TALKING EVER POINTED OUT THAT
EVEN CONSIDERING ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES PROGRESS WAS VERY SLOW THE
LAWYER WOULD OBJECT THAT PROGRESS WAS NOT SLOW AT ALL BUT THAT THEY
MIGHT HAVE PROGRESSED FAR FURTHER IF K
HAD COME TO HIM AT THE RIGHT
TIME
BUT HE HAD COME TO HIM LATE AND THAT LATENESS WOULD BRING STILL
FURTHER DIFFICULTIES AND NOT ONLY WHERE TIME WAS CONCERNED
THE ONLY
WELCOME INTERRUPTION DURING THESE VISITS WAS ALWAYS WHEN LENI CONTRIVED
TO BRING THE LAWYER HIS TEA WHILE K
WAS THERE
THEN SHE WOULD STAND
BEHIND K
PRETENDING TO WATCH THE LAWYER AS HE BENT GREEDILY OVER HIS
CUP POURED THE TEA IN AND DRANK AND SECRETLY LET K
HOLD HER HAND
THERE WAS ALWAYS COMPLETE SILENCE
THE LAWYER DRANK
K
SQUEEZED
LENI'S HAND AND LENI WOULD SOMETIMES DARE TO GENTLY STROKE K 'S HAIR
STILL HERE ARE YOU THE LAWYER WOULD ASK WHEN HE WAS READY
I
WANTED TO TAKE THE DISHES AWAY SAID LENI THEY WOULD GIVE EACH OTHER'S
HANDS A FINAL SQUEEZE THE LAWYER WOULD WIPE HIS MOUTH AND THEN START
TALKING AT K
AGAIN WITH RENEWED ENERGY
WAS THE LAWYER TRYING TO COMFORT K
OR TO CONFUSE HIM K
COULD
NOT TELL BUT IT SEEMED CLEAR TO HIM THAT HIS DEFENCE WAS NOT IN GOOD
HANDS
MAYBE EVERYTHING THE LAWYER SAID WAS QUITE RIGHT EVEN THOUGH HE
OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO MAKE HIMSELF AS CONSPICUOUS AS POSSIBLE AND PROBABLY
HAD NEVER EVEN TAKEN ON A CASE AS IMPORTANT AS HE SAID K 'S WAS
BUT IT
WAS STILL SUSPICIOUS HOW HE CONTINUALLY MENTIONED HIS PERSONAL CONTACTS
WITH THE CIVIL SERVANTS
WERE THEY TO BE EXPLOITED SOLELY FOR K 'S
BENEFIT THE LAWYER NEVER FORGOT TO MENTION THAT THEY WERE DEALING ONLY
WITH JUNIOR OFFICIALS WHICH MEANT OFFICIALS WHO WERE DEPENDENT ON
OTHERS AND THE DIRECTION TAKEN IN EACH TRIAL COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR
THEIR OWN FURTHERMENT
COULD IT BE THAT THEY WERE MAKING USE OF THE
LAWYER TO TURN TRIALS IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION WHICH WOULD OF COURSE
ALWAYS BE AT THE COST OF THE DEFENDANT IT CERTAINLY DID NOT MEAN THAT
THEY WOULD DO THAT IN EVERY TRIAL THAT WAS NOT LIKELY AT ALL AND THERE
WERE PROBABLY ALSO TRIALS WHERE THEY GAVE THE LAWYER ADVANTAGES AND ALL
THE ROOM HE NEEDED TO TURN IT IN THE DIRECTION HE WANTED AS IT WOULD
ALSO BE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO KEEP HIS REPUTATION INTACT
IF THAT
REALLY WAS THEIR RELATIONSHIP HOW WOULD THEY DIRECT K 'S TRIAL WHICH
AS THE LAWYER HAD EXPLAINED WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT AND THEREFORE
IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO ATTRACT GREAT ATTENTION FROM THE VERY FIRST TIME IT
CAME TO COURT THERE COULD NOT BE MUCH DOUBT ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD DO
THE FIRST SIGNS OF IT COULD ALREADY BE SEEN IN THE FACT THAT THE FIRST
DOCUMENTS STILL HAD NOT BEEN SUBMITTED EVEN THOUGH THE TRIAL HAD ALREADY
LASTED SEVERAL MONTHS AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE LAWYER EVERYTHING WAS
STILL IN ITS INITIAL STAGES WHICH WAS VERY EFFECTIVE OF COURSE IN
MAKING THE DEFENDANT PASSIVE AND KEEPING HIM HELPLESS
THEN HE COULD BE
SUDDENLY SURPRISED WITH THE VERDICT OR AT LEAST WITH A NOTIFICATION
THAT THE HEARING HAD NOT DECIDED IN HIS FAVOUR AND THE MATTER WOULD BE
PASSED ON TO A HIGHER OFFICE
IT WAS ESSENTIAL THAT K
TAKE A HAND IN IT HIMSELF
ON WINTER'S
MORNINGS SUCH AS THIS WHEN HE WAS VERY TIRED AND EVERYTHING DRAGGED
ITSELF LETHARGICALLY THROUGH HIS HEAD THIS BELIEF OF HIS SEEMED
IRREFUTABLE
HE NO LONGER FELT THE CONTEMPT FOR THE TRIAL THAT HE HAD
HAD EARLIER
IF HE HAD BEEN ALONE IN THE WORLD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY
FOR HIM TO IGNORE IT ALTHOUGH IT WAS ALSO CERTAIN THAT IN THAT CASE
THE TRIAL WOULD NEVER HAVE ARISEN IN THE FIRST PLACE
BUT NOW HIS
UNCLE HAD ALREADY DRAGGED HIM TO SEE THE LAWYER HE HAD TO TAKE ACCOUNT
OF HIS FAMILY HIS JOB WAS NO LONGER TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM THE PROGRESS
OF THE TRIAL HE HIMSELF HAD CARELESSLY WITH A CERTAIN INEXPLICABLE
COMPLACENCY MENTIONED IT TO ACQUAINTANCES AND OTHERS HAD LEARNED ABOUT
IT IN WAYS HE DID NOT KNOW HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MISS BRSTNER SEEMED
TO BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF IT
IN SHORT HE NO LONGER HAD ANY CHOICE
WHETHER HE WOULD ACCEPT THE TRIAL OR TURN IT DOWN HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT AND HAD TO DEFEND HIMSELF
IF HE WAS TIRED THEN THAT WAS BAD
BUT THERE WAS NO REASON TO WORRY TOO MUCH BEFORE HE NEEDED TO
HE
HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF WORKING HIMSELF UP TO HIS HIGH POSITION IN THE BANK
IN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME AND TO RETAIN IT WITH RESPECT FROM EVERYONE
NOW HE SIMPLY HAD TO APPLY SOME OF THE TALENTS THAT HAD MADE THAT
POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO THE TRIAL AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT IT HAD TO
TURN OUT WELL
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF SOMETHING WAS TO BE
ACHIEVED WAS TO REJECT IN ADVANCE ANY IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE IN ANY WAY
GUILTY
THERE WAS NO GUILT
THE TRIAL WAS NOTHING BUT A BIG PIECE OF
BUSINESS JUST LIKE HE HAD ALREADY CONCLUDED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE BANK
MANY TIMES A PIECE OF BUSINESS THAT CONCEALED MANY LURKING DANGERS
WAITING IN AMBUSH FOR HIM AS THEY USUALLY DID AND THESE DANGERS WOULD
NEED TO BE DEFENDED AGAINST
IF THAT WAS TO BE ACHIEVED THEN HE MUST
NOT ENTERTAIN ANY IDEA OF GUILT WHATEVER HE DID HE WOULD NEED TO LOOK
AFTER HIS OWN INTERESTS AS CLOSELY AS HE COULD
SEEN IN THIS WAY THERE
WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE HIS REPRESENTATION AWAY FROM THE LAWYER VERY
SOON AT BEST THAT VERY EVENING
THE LAWYER HAD TOLD HIM AS HE TALKED
TO HIM THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING UNHEARD OF AND WOULD PROBABLY DO HIM A
GREAT DEAL OF HARM BUT K
COULD NOT TOLERATE ANY IMPEDIMENT TO HIS
EFFORTS WHERE HIS TRIAL WAS CONCERNED AND THESE IMPEDIMENTS WERE
PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE LAWYER HIMSELF
BUT ONCE HE HAD SHAKEN OFF THE
LAWYER THE DOCUMENTS WOULD NEED TO BE SUBMITTED STRAIGHT AWAY AND IF
POSSIBLE HE WOULD NEED TO SEE TO IT THAT THEY WERE BEING DEALT WITH
EVERY DAY
IT WOULD OF COURSE NOT BE ENOUGH IF THAT WAS TO BE DONE
FOR K
TO SIT IN THE CORRIDOR WITH HIS HAT UNDER THE BENCH LIKE THE
OTHERS
DAY AFTER DAY HE HIMSELF OR ONE OF THE WOMEN OR SOMEBODY ELSE
ON HIS BEHALF WOULD HAVE TO RUN AFTER THE OFFICIALS AND FORCE THEM TO
SIT AT THEIR DESKS AND STUDY K 'S DOCUMENTS INSTEAD OF LOOKING OUT ON
THE CORRIDOR THROUGH THE GRATING
THERE COULD BE NO LET UP IN THESE
EFFORTS EVERYTHING WOULD NEED TO BE ORGANISED AND SUPERVISED IT WAS
ABOUT TIME THAT THE COURT CAME UP AGAINST A DEFENDANT WHO KNEW HOW TO
DEFEND AND MAKE USE OF HIS RIGHTS
BUT WHEN K
HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO TRY AND DO ALL THIS THE
DIFFICULTY OF COMPOSING THE DOCUMENTS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM
EARLIER
JUST A WEEK OR SO BEFORE HE COULD ONLY HAVE FELT SHAME AT THE THOUGHT
OF BEING MADE TO WRITE OUT SUCH DOCUMENTS HIMSELF IT HAD NEVER ENTERED
HIS HEAD THAT THE TASK COULD ALSO BE DIFFICULT
HE REMEMBERED ONE
MORNING WHEN ALREADY PILED UP WITH WORK HE SUDDENLY SHOVED EVERYTHING
TO ONE SIDE AND TOOK A PAD OF PAPER ON WHICH HE SKETCHED OUT SOME OF HIS
THOUGHTS ON HOW DOCUMENTS OF THIS SORT SHOULD PROCEED
PERHAPS HE WOULD
OFFER THEM TO THAT SLOW WITTED LAWYER BUT JUST THEN THE DOOR OF THE
MANAGER'S OFFICE OPENED AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR ENTERED THE ROOM WITH A
LOUD LAUGH
K
WAS VERY EMBARRASSED ALTHOUGH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF
COURSE WAS NOT LAUGHING AT K 'S DOCUMENTS WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT
BUT AT A JOKE HE HAD JUST HEARD ABOUT THE STOCK EXCHANGE A JOKE WHICH
NEEDED AN ILLUSTRATION IF IT WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AND NOW THE DEPUTY
DIRECTOR LEANT OVER K 'S DESK TOOK HIS PENCIL FROM HIS HAND AND DREW
THE ILLUSTRATION ON THE WRITING PAD THAT K
HAD INTENDED FOR HIS IDEAS
ABOUT HIS CASE
K
NOW HAD NO MORE THOUGHTS OF SHAME THE DOCUMENTS HAD TO BE
PREPARED AND SUBMITTED
IF AS WAS VERY LIKELY HE COULD FIND NO TIME
TO DO IT IN THE OFFICE HE WOULD HAVE TO DO IT AT HOME AT NIGHT
IF THE
NIGHTS WEREN'T ENOUGH HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A HOLIDAY
ABOVE ALL HE COULD
NOT STOP HALF WAY THAT WAS NONSENSE NOT ONLY IN BUSINESS BUT ALWAYS AND
EVERYWHERE
NEEDLESS TO SAY THE DOCUMENTS WOULD MEAN AN ALMOST ENDLESS
AMOUNT OF WORK
IT WAS EASY TO COME TO THE BELIEF NOT ONLY FOR THOSE
OF AN ANXIOUS DISPOSITION THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE EVER TO FINISH IT
THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE OF LAZINESS OR DECEIT WHICH WERE THE ONLY THINGS
THAT MIGHT HAVE HINDERED THE LAWYER IN PREPARING IT BUT BECAUSE HE DID
NOT KNOW WHAT THE CHARGE WAS OR EVEN WHAT CONSEQUENCES IT MIGHT BRING
SO THAT HE HAD TO REMEMBER EVERY TINY ACTION AND EVENT FROM THE WHOLE OF
HIS LIFE LOOKING AT THEM FROM ALL SIDES AND CHECKING AND RECONSIDERING
THEM
IT WAS ALSO A VERY DISHEARTENING JOB
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
SUITABLE AS A WAY OF PASSING THE LONG DAYS AFTER HE HAD RETIRED AND
BECOME SENILE
BUT NOW JUST WHEN K
NEEDED TO APPLY ALL HIS THOUGHTS
TO HIS WORK WHEN HE WAS STILL RISING AND ALREADY POSED A THREAT TO THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHEN EVERY HOUR PASSED SO QUICKLY AND HE WANTED TO
ENJOY THE BRIEF EVENINGS AND NIGHTS AS A YOUNG MAN THIS WAS THE TIME HE
HAD TO START WORKING OUT THESE DOCUMENTS
ONCE MORE HE BEGAN TO FEEL
RESENTMENT
ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY ONLY TO PUT AN END TO IT HIS FINGER
FELT FOR THE BUTTON OF THE ELECTRIC BELL IN THE ANTE ROOM
AS HE
PRESSED IT HE GLANCED UP TO THE CLOCK
IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK TWO
HOURS HE HAD SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS COSTLY TIME JUST DREAMING AND
HIS WITS WERE OF COURSE EVEN MORE DULLED THAN THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE
BUT THE TIME HAD NONETHELESS NOT BEEN WASTED HE HAD COME TO SOME
DECISIONS THAT COULD BE OF VALUE
AS WELL AS VARIOUS PIECES OF MAIL
THE SERVITORS BROUGHT TWO VISITING CARDS FROM GENTLEMEN WHO HAD ALREADY
BEEN WAITING FOR K
FOR SOME TIME
THEY WERE ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT
CLIENTS OF THE BANK WHO SHOULD NOT REALLY HAVE BEEN KEPT WAITING UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
WHY HAD THEY COME AT SUCH AN AWKWARD TIME AND WHY
THE GENTLEMEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CLOSED DOOR SEEMED TO BE ASKING
WAS THE INDUSTRIOUS K
USING UP THE BEST BUSINESS TIME FOR HIS PRIVATE
AFFAIRS TIRED FROM WHAT HAD GONE BEFORE AND TIRED IN ANTICIPATION OF
WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW K
STOOD UP TO RECEIVE THE FIRST OF THEM
HE WAS A SHORT JOLLY MAN A MANUFACTURER WHO K
KNEW WELL
HE
APOLOGISED FOR DISTURBING K
AT SOME IMPORTANT WORK AND K FOR HIS
PART APOLOGISED FOR HAVING KEPT THE MANUFACTURER WAITING FOR SO LONG
BUT EVEN THIS APOLOGY WAS SPOKEN IN SUCH A MECHANICAL WAY AND WITH SUCH
FALSE INTONATION THAT THE MANUFACTURER WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE NOTICED IF
HE HAD NOT BEEN FULLY PREOCCUPIED WITH HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS
INSTEAD
HE HURRIEDLY PULLED CALCULATIONS AND TABLES OUT FROM ALL HIS POCKETS
SPREAD THEM OUT IN FRONT OF K EXPLAINED SEVERAL ITEMS CORRECTED A
LITTLE MISTAKE IN THE ARITHMETIC THAT HE NOTICED AS HE QUICKLY GLANCED
OVER IT ALL AND REMINDED K
OF A SIMILAR PIECE OF BUSINESS HE'D
CONCLUDED WITH HIM ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE MENTIONING IN PASSING THAT THIS
TIME THERE WAS ANOTHER BANK SPENDING GREAT EFFORT TO GET HIS BUSINESS
AND FINALLY STOPPED SPEAKING IN ORDER TO LEARN K 'S OPINION ON THE
MATTER
AND K
HAD INDEED AT FIRST BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING WHAT THE
MANUFACTURER WAS SAYING HE TOO WAS AWARE OF HOW IMPORTANT THE DEAL WAS
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT LAST HE SOON STOPPED LISTENING NODDED AT
EACH OF THE MANUFACTURER'S LOUDER EXCLAMATIONS FOR A SHORT WHILE BUT
EVENTUALLY HE STOPPED DOING EVEN THAT AND DID NO MORE THAN STARE AT THE
BALD HEAD BENT OVER THE PAPERS ASKING HIMSELF WHEN THE MANUFACTURER
WOULD FINALLY REALISE THAT EVERYTHING HE WAS SAYING WAS USELESS
WHEN
HE DID STOP TALKING K
REALLY THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THIS WAS SO THAT HE
WOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO CONFESS THAT HE WAS INCAPABLE OF LISTENING
INSTEAD SEEING THE ANTICIPATION ON THE MANUFACTURER'S FACE OBVIOUSLY
READY TO COUNTER ANY OBJECTIONS MADE HE WAS SORRY TO REALISE THAT THE
BUSINESS DISCUSSION HAD TO BE CONTINUED
SO HE BENT HIS HEAD AS IF HE'D
BEEN GIVEN AN ORDER AND BEGAN SLOWLY TO MOVE HIS PENCIL OVER THE PAPERS
NOW AND THEN HE WOULD STOP AND STARE AT ONE OF THE FIGURES
THE
MANUFACTURER THOUGHT THERE MUST BE SOME OBJECTION PERHAPS HIS FIGURES
WEREN'T REALLY SOUND PERHAPS THEY WEREN'T THE DECISIVE ISSUE WHATEVER
HE THOUGHT THE MANUFACTURER COVERED THE PAPERS WITH HIS HAND AND BEGAN
ONCE AGAIN MOVING VERY CLOSE TO K TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE DEAL WAS ALL
ABOUT
IT IS DIFFICULT SAID K PURSING HIS LIPS
THE ONLY THING
THAT COULD OFFER HIM ANY GUIDANCE WERE THE PAPERS AND THE MANUFACTURER
HAD COVERED THEM FROM HIS VIEW SO HE JUST SANK BACK AGAINST THE ARM OF
THE CHAIR
EVEN WHEN THE DOOR OF THE MANAGER'S OFFICE OPENED AND
REVEALED NOT VERY CLEARLY AS IF THROUGH A VEIL THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR HE
DID NO MORE THAN LOOK UP WEAKLY
K
THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER
HE MERELY WATCHED THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR'S
APPEARANCE AND FOR HIM THE EFFECT WAS VERY PLEASING THE MANUFACTURER
IMMEDIATELY JUMPED UP FROM HIS SEAT AND HURRIED OVER TO MEET THE DEPUTY
DIRECTOR ALTHOUGH K
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO MAKE HIM TEN TIMES LIVELIER AS
HE FEARED THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR MIGHT DISAPPEAR AGAIN
HE NEED NOT HAVE
WORRIED THE TWO GENTLEMEN MET EACH OTHER SHOOK EACH OTHER'S HAND AND
WENT TOGETHER OVER TO K 'S DESK
THE MANUFACTURER SAID HE WAS SORRY TO
FIND THE CHIEF CLERK SO LITTLE INCLINED TO DO BUSINESS POINTING TO K
WHO UNDER THE VIEW OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR HAD BENT BACK DOWN OVER THE
PAPERS
AS THE TWO MEN LEANT OVER THE DESK AND THE MANUFACTURER MADE
SOME EFFORT TO GAIN AND KEEP THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR'S ATTENTION K
FELT AS
IF THEY WERE MUCH BIGGER THAN THEY REALLY WERE AND THAT THEIR
NEGOTIATIONS WERE ABOUT HIM
CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY TURNING HIS EYES
UPWARDS HE TRIED TO LEARN WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE ABOVE HIM TOOK ONE OF
THE PAPERS FROM HIS DESK WITHOUT LOOKING TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LAY IT ON
THE FLAT OF HIS HAND AND RAISED IT SLOWLY UP AS HE ROSE UP TO THE LEVEL
OF THE TWO MEN HIMSELF
HE HAD NO PARTICULAR PLAN IN MIND AS HE DID
THIS BUT MERELY FELT THIS WAS HOW HE WOULD ACT IF ONLY HE HAD FINISHED
PREPARING THAT GREAT DOCUMENT THAT WAS TO REMOVE HIS BURDEN ENTIRELY
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR HAD BEEN PAYING ALL HIS ATTENTION TO THE
CONVERSATION AND DID NO MORE THAN GLANCE AT THE PAPER HE DID NOT READ
WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT AT ALL AS WHAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE CHIEF CLERK
WAS NOT IMPORTANT FOR HIM HE TOOK IT FROM K 'S HAND SAYING THANK YOU
I'M ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH EVERYTHING AND LAY IT CALMLY BACK ON THE
DESK
K
GAVE HIM A BITTER SIDEWAYS LOOK
BUT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR DID
NOT NOTICE THIS AT ALL OR IF HE DID NOTICE IT IT ONLY RAISED HIS
SPIRITS HE FREQUENTLY LAUGHED OUT LOUD ONE TIME HE CLEARLY EMBARRASSED
THE MANUFACTURER WHEN HE RAISED AN OBJECTION IN A WITTY WAY BUT DREW HIM
IMMEDIATELY BACK OUT OF HIS EMBARRASSMENT BY COMMENTING ADVERSELY ON
HIMSELF AND FINALLY INVITED HIM INTO HIS OFFICE WHERE THEY COULD BRING
THE MATTER TO ITS CONCLUSION
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER SAID THE
MANUFACTURER
I UNDERSTAND THAT COMPLETELY
AND I'M SURE THE CHIEF
CLERK EVEN AS HE SAID THIS HE WAS ACTUALLY SPEAKING ONLY TO THE
MANUFACTURER WILL BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE US TAKE IT OFF HIS HANDS
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS CALM CONSIDERATION
BUT HE SEEMS TO BE
OVER BURDENED TODAY THERE ARE EVEN SOME PEOPLE IN THE ROOM OUTSIDE
WHO'VE BEEN WAITING THERE FOR HOURS FOR HIM K
STILL HAD ENOUGH
CONTROL OF HIMSELF TO TURN AWAY FROM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND DIRECT HIS
FRIENDLY ALBEIT STIFF SMILE ONLY AT THE MANUFACTURER HE MADE NO OTHER
RETALIATION BENT DOWN SLIGHTLY AND SUPPORTED HIMSELF WITH BOTH HANDS ON
HIS DESK LIKE A CLERK AND WATCHED AS THE TWO GENTLEMEN STILL TALKING
TOOK THE PAPERS FROM HIS DESK AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE MANAGER'S OFFICE
IN THE DOORWAY THE MANUFACTURER TURNED AND SAID HE WOULDN'T MAKE HIS
FAREWELL WITH K
JUST YET HE WOULD OF COURSE LET THE CHIEF CLERK KNOW
ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF HIS DISCUSSIONS BUT HE ALSO HAD A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO TELL HIM ABOUT
AT LAST K
WAS BY HIMSELF
IT DID NOT ENTER HIS HEAD TO SHOW
ANYONE ELSE INTO HIS OFFICE AND ONLY BECAME VAGUELY AWARE OF HOW NICE IT
WAS THAT THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THOUGHT HE WAS STILL NEGOTIATING WITH THE
MANUFACTURER AND FOR THIS REASON HE COULD NOT LET ANYONE IN TO SEE
HIM NOT EVEN THE SERVITOR
HE WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW SAT DOWN ON THE
LEDGE BESIDE IT HELD FIRMLY ON TO THE HANDLE AND LOOKED DOWN ONTO THE
SQUARE OUTSIDE
THE SNOW WAS STILL FALLING THE WEATHER STILL HAD NOT
BRIGHTENED UP AT ALL
HE REMAINED A LONG TIME SITTING IN THIS WAY NOT KNOWING WHAT IT
ACTUALLY WAS THAT MADE HIM SO ANXIOUS ONLY OCCASIONALLY DID HE GLANCE
SLIGHTLY STARTLED OVER HIS SHOULDER AT THE DOOR TO THE OUTER ROOM
WHERE MISTAKENLY HE THOUGHT HE'D HEARD SOME NOISE
NO ONE CAME AND
THAT MADE HIM FEEL CALMER HE WENT OVER TO THE WASH STAND RINSED HIS
FACE WITH COLD WATER AND HIS HEAD SOMEWHAT CLEARER WENT BACK TO HIS
PLACE BY THE WINDOW
THE DECISION TO TAKE HIS DEFENCE INTO HIS OWN
HANDS NOW SEEMED MORE OF A BURDEN THAN HE HAD ORIGINALLY ASSUMED
ALL
THE WHILE HE HAD LEFT HIS DEFENCE UP TO THE LAWYER HIS TRIAL HAD HAD
LITTLE BASIC AFFECT ON HIM HE HAD OBSERVED IT FROM AFAR AS SOMETHING
THAT WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO REACH HIM DIRECTLY WHEN IT SUITED HIM HE
LOOKED TO SEE HOW THINGS STOOD BUT HE WAS ALSO ABLE TO DRAW HIS HEAD
BACK AGAIN WHENEVER HE WANTED
NOW IN CONTRAST IF HE WAS TO CONDUCT
HIS DEFENCE HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE TO DEVOTE HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THE
COURT FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST SUCCESS WOULD MEAN LATER ON HIS
COMPLETE AND CONCLUSIVE LIBERATION BUT IF HE WAS TO ACHIEVE THIS HE
WOULD HAVE TO PLACE HIMSELF TO START WITH IN FAR GREATER DANGER THAN
HE HAD BEEN IN SO FAR
IF HE EVER FELT TEMPTED TO DOUBT THIS THEN HIS
EXPERIENCE WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND THE MANUFACTURER THAT DAY WOULD
BE QUITE ENOUGH TO CONVINCE HIM OF IT
HOW COULD HE HAVE SAT THERE
TOTALLY CONVINCED OF THE NEED TO DO HIS OWN DEFENCE HOW WOULD IT BE
LATER WHAT WOULD HIS LIFE BE LIKE IN THE DAYS AHEAD WOULD HE FIND
THE WAY THROUGH IT ALL TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION DID A CAREFULLY WORKED
OUT DEFENCE AND ANY OTHER SORT WOULD HAVE MADE NO SENSE DID A
CAREFULLY WORKED OUT DEFENCE NOT ALSO MEAN HE WOULD NEED TO SHUT HIMSELF
OFF FROM EVERYTHING ELSE AS MUCH AS HE COULD WOULD HE SURVIVE THAT
AND HOW WAS HE TO SUCCEED IN CONDUCTING ALL THIS AT THE BANK IT
INVOLVED MUCH MORE THAN JUST SUBMITTING SOME DOCUMENTS THAT HE COULD
PROBABLY PREPARE IN A FEW DAYS' LEAVE ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT
TEMERITY TO ASK FOR TIME OFF FROM THE BANK JUST AT THAT TIME IT WAS A
WHOLE TRIAL AND THERE WAS NO WAY OF SEEING HOW LONG IT MIGHT LAST
THIS
WAS AN ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY THAT HAD SUDDENLY BEEN THROWN INTO K 'S LIFE
AND WAS HE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THE BANK'S WORK AT A TIME LIKE
THIS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HIS DESK
WAS HE SUPPOSED TO LET PEOPLE IN TO
SEE HIM AND GO INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHILE
HIS TRIAL TRUNDLED ON WHILE THE COURT OFFICIALS UPSTAIRS IN THE ATTIC
ROOM SAT LOOKING AT THE PAPERS FOR THIS TRIAL SHOULD HE BE WORRYING
ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF THE BANK DID THIS NOT SEEM LIKE A KIND OF
TORTURE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE COURT CONNECTED WITH THE TRIAL AND WHICH
FOLLOWED HIM AROUND AND IS IT LIKELY THAT ANYONE IN THE BANK WHEN
JUDGING HIS WORK WOULD TAKE ANY ACCOUNT OF HIS PECULIAR SITUATION NO
ONE AND NEVER
THERE WERE THOSE WHO KNEW ABOUT HIS TRIAL ALTHOUGH IT
WAS NOT QUITE CLEAR WHO KNEW ABOUT IT OR HOW MUCH
BUT HE HOPED RUMOURS
HAD NOT REACHED AS FAR AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OTHERWISE HE WOULD
OBVIOUSLY SOON FIND A WAY OF MAKING USE OF IT TO HARM K HE WOULD SHOW
NEITHER COMRADESHIP NOR HUMANENESS
AND WHAT ABOUT THE DIRECTOR IT
WAS TRUE THAT HE WAS WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS K AND AS SOON AS HE HEARD
ABOUT THE TRIAL HE WOULD PROBABLY TRY TO DO EVERYTHING HE COULD TO MAKE
IT EASIER FOR HIM BUT HE WOULD CERTAINLY NOT DEVOTE HIMSELF TO IT
K
AT ONE TIME HAD PROVIDED THE COUNTER BALANCE TO WHAT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR
SAID BUT THE DIRECTOR WAS NOW COMING MORE AND MORE UNDER HIS INFLUENCE
AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WOULD ALSO EXPLOIT THE WEAKENED CONDITION OF THE
DIRECTOR TO STRENGTHEN HIS OWN POWER
SO WHAT COULD K
HOPE FOR MAYBE
CONSIDERATIONS OF THIS SORT WEAKENED HIS POWER OF RESISTANCE BUT IT WAS
STILL NECESSARY NOT TO DECEIVE ONESELF AND TO SEE EVERYTHING AS CLEARLY
AS IT COULD BE SEEN AT THAT MOMENT
FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON JUST TO AVOIDING RETURNING TO HIS DESK
FOR A WHILE HE OPENED THE WINDOW
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO OPEN AND HE HAD
TO TURN THE HANDLE WITH BOTH HIS HANDS
THEN THROUGH THE WHOLE HEIGHT
AND BREADTH OF THE WINDOW THE MIXTURE OF FOG AND SMOKE WAS DRAWN INTO
THE ROOM FILLING IT WITH A SLIGHT SMELL OF BURNING
A FEW FLAKES OF
SNOW WERE BLOWN IN WITH IT
IT'S A HORRIBLE AUTUMN SAID THE
MANUFACTURER WHO HAD COME INTO THE ROOM UNNOTICED AFTER SEEING THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND NOW STOOD BEHIND K
K
NODDED AND LOOKED UNEASILY
AT THE MANUFACTURER'S BRIEFCASE FROM WHICH HE WOULD NOW PROBABLY TAKE
THE PAPERS AND INFORM K
OF THE RESULT OF HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR
HOWEVER THE MANUFACTURER SAW WHERE K
WAS LOOKING
KNOCKED ON HIS BRIEFCASE AND WITHOUT OPENING IT SAID YOU'LL BE WANTING
TO HEAR HOW THINGS TURNED OUT
I'VE ALREADY GOT THE CONTRACT IN MY
POCKET ALMOST
HE'S A CHARMING MAN YOUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR HE'S GOT
HIS DANGERS THOUGH HE LAUGHED AS HE SHOOK K 'S HAND AND WANTED TO
MAKE HIM LAUGH WITH HIM
BUT TO K IT ONCE MORE SEEMED SUSPICIOUS THAT
THE MANUFACTURER DID NOT WANT TO SHOW HIM THE PAPERS AND SAW NOTHING
ABOUT HIS COMMENTS TO LAUGH AT
CHIEF CLERK SAID THE MANUFACTURER
I EXPECT THE WEATHER'S BEEN AFFECTING YOUR MOOD HAS IT YOU'RE LOOKING
SO WORRIED TODAY YES SAID K RAISING HIS HAND AND HOLDING THE
TEMPLE OF HIS HEAD HEADACHES WORRIES IN THE FAMILY QUITE RIGHT
SAID THE MANUFACTURER WHO WAS ALWAYS IN A HURRY AND COULD NEVER LISTEN
TO ANYONE FOR VERY LONG EVERYONE HAS HIS CROSS TO BEAR K
HAD
UNCONSCIOUSLY MADE A STEP TOWARDS THE DOOR AS IF WANTING TO SHOW THE
MANUFACTURER OUT BUT THE MANUFACTURER SAID CHIEF CLERK THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE I'D LIKE TO MENTION TO YOU
I'M VERY SORRY IF IT'S
SOMETHING THAT'LL BE A BURDEN TO YOU TODAY OF ALL DAYS BUT I'VE BEEN TO
SEE YOU TWICE ALREADY LATELY AND EACH TIME I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT
IF
I DELAY IT ANY LONGER IT MIGHT WELL LOSE ITS POINT ALTOGETHER
THAT
WOULD BE A PITY AS I THINK WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY DOES HAVE SOME VALUE
BEFORE K
HAD HAD THE TIME TO ANSWER THE MANUFACTURER CAME UP CLOSE TO
HIM TAPPED HIS KNUCKLE LIGHTLY ON HIS CHEST AND SAID QUIETLY YOU'VE
GOT A TRIAL GOING ON HAVEN'T YOU K
STEPPED BACK AND IMMEDIATELY
EXCLAIMED THAT'S WHAT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR'S BEEN TELLING YOU NO
NO SAID THE MANUFACTURER HOW WOULD THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR KNOW ABOUT
IT AND WHAT ABOUT YOU ASKED K ALREADY MORE IN CONTROL OF
HIMSELF
I HEAR THINGS ABOUT THE COURT HERE AND THERE SAID THE
MANUFACTURER AND THAT EVEN APPLIES TO WHAT IT IS THAT I WANTED TO TELL
YOU ABOUT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH THE
COURT SAID K
WITH LOWERED HEAD AND HE LED THE MANUFACTURER OVER TO
HIS DESK
THEY SAT DOWN WHERE THEY HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THE
MANUFACTURER SAID I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT VERY MUCH THAT I'VE GOT TO TELL
YOU ABOUT
ONLY IN MATTERS LIKE THIS IT'S BEST NOT TO OVERLOOK THE
TINIEST DETAILS
BESIDES I REALLY WANT TO HELP YOU IN SOME WAY
HOWEVER MODEST MY HELP MIGHT BE
WE'VE BEEN GOOD BUSINESS PARTNERS UP
TILL NOW HAVEN'T WE WELL THEN K
WANTED TO APOLOGISE FOR HIS
BEHAVIOUR IN THE CONVERSATION EARLIER THAT DAY BUT THE MANUFACTURER
WOULD TOLERATE NO INTERRUPTION SHOVED HIS BRIEFCASE UP HIGH IN HIS
ARMPIT TO SHOW THAT HE WAS IN A HURRY AND CARRIED ON
I KNOW ABOUT
YOUR CASE THROUGH A CERTAIN TITORELLI
HE'S A PAINTER TITORELLI'S JUST
HIS ARTISTIC NAME I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HIS REAL NAME IS
HE'S BEEN
COMING TO ME IN MY OFFICE FOR YEARS FROM TIME TO TIME AND BRINGS LITTLE
PICTURES WITH HIM WHICH I BUY MORE OR LESS JUST FOR THE SAKE OF CHARITY
AS HE'S HARDLY MORE THAN A BEGGAR
AND THEY'RE NICE PICTURES TOO
MOORLAND LANDSCAPES AND THAT SORT OF THING
WE'D BOTH GOT USED TO DOING
BUSINESS IN THIS WAY AND IT ALWAYS WENT SMOOTHLY
ONLY ONE TIME THESE
VISITS BECAME A BIT TOO FREQUENT I BEGAN TO TELL HIM OFF FOR IT WE
STARTED TALKING AND I BECAME INTERESTED HOW IT WAS THAT HE COULD EARN A
LIVING JUST BY PAINTING AND THEN I LEARNED TO MY AMAZEMENT THAT HIS
MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME WAS PAINTING PORTRAITS
'I WORK FOR THE COURT
HE SAID 'WHAT COURT SAID I
AND THAT'S WHEN HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE
COURT
I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW AMAZED I WAS AT BEING TOLD ALL
THIS
EVER SINCE THEN I LEARN SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE COURT EVERY TIME
HE COMES TO VISIT AND SO LITTLE BY LITTLE I GET TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING
OF HOW IT WORKS
ANYWAY TITORELLI TALKS A LOT AND I OFTEN HAVE TO PUSH
HIM AWAY NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE'S BOUND TO BE LYING BUT ALSO MOST OF ALL
BECAUSE A BUSINESSMAN LIKE ME WHO'S ALREADY CLOSE TO BREAKING POINT
UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HIS OWN BUSINESS WORRIES CAN'T PAY TOO MUCH
ATTENTION TO OTHER PEOPLE'S
BUT ALL THAT'S JUST BY THE BY
PERHAPS
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING PERHAPS TITORELLI MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HELP YOU IN SOME SMALL WAY HE KNOWS LOTS OF JUDGES AND EVEN IF HE CAN'T
HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE HIMSELF HE CAN GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO GET
SOME INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE
AND EVEN IF THIS ADVICE DOESN'T
TURN OUT TO MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE I STILL THINK IT'LL BE VERY
IMPORTANT ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT
YOU'RE NEARLY A LAWYER YOURSELF
THAT'S
WHAT I ALWAYS SAY MR
K
THE CHIEF CLERK IS NEARLY A LAWYER
OH I'M
SURE THIS TRIAL OF YOURS WILL TURN OUT ALL RIGHT
SO DO YOU WANT TO GO
AND SEE TITORELLI THEN IF I ASK HIM TO HE'LL CERTAINLY DO EVERYTHING
HE POSSIBLY CAN
I REALLY DO THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO
IT NEEDN'T BE
TODAY OF COURSE JUST SOME TIME WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE
AND ANYWAY
I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS TOO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO AND SEE
TITORELLI THIS ADVICE FROM ME DOESN'T PLACE YOU UNDER ANY OBLIGATION AT
ALL
NO IF YOU THINK YOU CAN GET BY WITHOUT TITORELLI IT'LL CERTAINLY
BE BETTER TO LEAVE HIM COMPLETELY OUT OF IT
MAYBE YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A
CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND TITORELLI COULD UPSET YOUR PLANS
NO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN OF COURSE YOU SHOULDN'T GO THERE UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT CERTAINLY WON'T BE EASY TO TAKE ADVICE FROM A LAD
LIKE THAT
STILL IT'S UP TO YOU
HERE'S THE LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
AND HERE'S THE ADDRESS
DISAPPOINTED K
TOOK THE LETTER AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
EVEN
AT BEST THE ADVANTAGE HE MIGHT DERIVE FROM THIS RECOMMENDATION WAS
INCOMPARABLY SMALLER THAN THE DAMAGE THAT LAY IN THE FACT OF THE
MANUFACTURER KNOWING ABOUT HIS TRIAL AND THAT THE PAINTER WAS SPREADING
THE NEWS ABOUT
IT WAS ALL HE COULD MANAGE TO GIVE THE MANUFACTURER WHO
WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO THE DOOR A FEW WORDS OF THANKS
I'LL GO
THERE HE SAID AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE OF THE MANUFACTURER AT THE DOOR
OR AS I'M VERY BUSY AT PRESENT I'LL WRITE TO HIM PERHAPS HE WOULD
LIKE TO COME TO ME IN MY OFFICE SOME TIME I WAS SURE YOU'D FIND THE
BEST SOLUTION SAID THE MANUFACTURER
ALTHOUGH I HAD THOUGHT YOU'D
PREFER TO AVOID INVITING PEOPLE LIKE THIS TITORELLI TO THE BANK AND
TALKING ABOUT THE TRIAL HERE
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA TO SEND
LETTERS TO PEOPLE LIKE TITORELLI YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO
THEM
BUT YOU'RE BOUND TO HAVE THOUGHT EVERYTHING THROUGH AND YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO K
NODDED AND ACCOMPANIED THE MANUFACTURER
ON THROUGH THE ANTE ROOM
BUT DESPITE SEEMING CALM ON THE OUTSIDE HE
WAS ACTUALLY VERY SHOCKED HE HAD TOLD THE MANUFACTURER HE WOULD WRITE
TO TITORELLI ONLY TO SHOW HIM IN SOME WAY THAT HE VALUED HIS
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WOULD CONSIDER THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH
TITORELLI WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF HE HAD THOUGHT TITORELLI COULD OFFER ANY
WORTHWHILE ASSISTANCE HE WOULD NOT HAVE DELAYED
BUT IT WAS ONLY THE
MANUFACTURER'S COMMENT THAT MADE K
REALISE WHAT DANGERS THAT COULD LEAD
TO
WAS HE REALLY ABLE TO RELY ON HIS OWN UNDERSTANDING SO LITTLE IF
IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT HE MIGHT INVITE A QUESTIONABLE CHARACTER INTO THE
BANK WITH A CLEAR LETTER AND ASK ADVICE FROM HIM ABOUT HIS TRIAL
SEPARATED FROM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR BY NO MORE THAN A DOOR WAS IT NOT
POSSIBLE OR EVEN VERY LIKELY THAT THERE WERE ALSO OTHER DANGERS HE HAD
FAILED TO SEE OR THAT HE WAS EVEN RUNNING TOWARDS THERE WAS NOT ALWAYS
SOMEONE BESIDE HIM TO WARN HIM
AND JUST NOW JUST WHEN HE WOULD HAVE
TO ACT WITH ALL THE STRENGTH HE COULD MUSTER NOW A NUMBER OF DOUBTS OF
A SORT HE HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN HAD PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND AFFECTED
HIS OWN VIGILANCE THE DIFFICULTIES HE HAD BEEN FEELING IN CARRYING OUT
HIS OFFICE WORK WERE THEY NOW GOING TO AFFECT THE TRIAL TOO NOW AT
LEAST HE FOUND HIMSELF QUITE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE
INTENDED TO WRITE TO TITORELLI AND INVITE HIM INTO THE BANK
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AT THE THOUGHT OF IT ONCE MORE AS THE SERVITOR
CAME UP BESIDE HIM AND DREW HIS ATTENTION TO THE THREE GENTLEMEN WHO
WERE WAITING ON A BENCH IN THE ANTE ROOM
THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN WAITING
TO SEE K
FOR A LONG TIME
NOW THAT THE SERVITOR WAS SPEAKING WITH K
THEY HAD STOOD UP AND EACH OF THEM WANTED TO MAKE USE OF THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SEE K
BEFORE THE OTHERS
IT HAD BEEN NEGLIGENT OF THE BANK TO LET
THEM WASTE THEIR TIME HERE IN THE WAITING ROOM BUT NONE OF THEM WANTED
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS
MR
K ONE OF THEM WAS SAYING BUT K
HAD TOLD THE SERVITOR TO FETCH HIS WINTER COAT AND SAID TO THE THREE OF
THEM AS THE SERVITOR HELPED HIM TO PUT IT ON PLEASE FORGIVE ME
GENTLEMEN I'M AFRAID I HAVE NO TIME TO SEE YOU AT PRESENT
PLEASE DO
FORGIVE ME BUT I HAVE SOME URGENT BUSINESS TO SETTLE AND HAVE TO LEAVE
STRAIGHT AWAY
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN YOURSELVES HOW LONG I'VE BEEN
DELAYED
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS TO COME BACK TOMORROW OR SOME TIME
OR PERHAPS WE COULD SETTLE YOUR AFFAIRS BY TELEPHONE OR PERHAPS YOU
WOULD LIKE TO TELL ME NOW BRIEFLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND I CAN THEN GIVE
YOU A FULL ANSWER IN WRITING
WHATEVER THE BEST THING WILL BE FOR YOU
TO COME HERE AGAIN THE GENTLEMEN NOW SAW THAT THEIR WAIT HAD BEEN
TOTALLY POINTLESS AND THESE SUGGESTIONS OF K 'S LEFT THEM SO ASTOUNDED
THAT THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD
THAT'S AGREED THEN IS
IT ASKED K WHO HAD TURNED TOWARD THE SERVITOR BRINGING HIM HIS HAT
THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR OF K 'S OFFICE THEY COULD SEE THAT THE SNOWFALL
OUTSIDE HAD BECOME MUCH HEAVIER
SO K
TURNED THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT UP
AND BUTTONED IT UP HIGH UNDER HIS CHIN
JUST THEN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR
CAME OUT OF THE ADJOINING ROOM SMILED AS HE SAW K
NEGOTIATING WITH THE
GENTLEMEN IN HIS WINTER COAT AND ASKED ARE YOU ABOUT TO GO OUT
YES SAID K STANDING MORE UPRIGHT I HAVE TO GO OUT ON SOME
BUSINESS BUT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR HAD ALREADY TURNED TOWARDS THE
GENTLEMEN
AND WHAT ABOUT THESE GENTLEMEN HE ASKED
I THINK
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN WAITING QUITE A LONG TIME WE'VE ALREADY COME TO
AN UNDERSTANDING SAID K
BUT NOW THE GENTLEMEN COULD BE HELD BACK NO
LONGER THEY SURROUNDED K
AND EXPLAINED THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
WAITING FOR HOURS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT THAT HAD
TO BE DISCUSSED NOW AT LENGTH AND IN PRIVATE
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR
LISTENED TO THEM FOR A SHORT WHILE HE ALSO LOOKED AT K
AS HE HELD HIS
HAT IN HIS HAND CLEANING THE DUST OFF IT HERE AND THERE AND THEN HE
SAID GENTLEMEN THERE IS A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO SOLVE THIS
IF YOU
WOULD PREFER IT I'LL BE VERY GLAD TO TAKE OVER THESE NEGOTIATIONS
INSTEAD OF THE CHIEF CLERK
YOUR BUSINESS DOES OF COURSE NEED TO BE
DISCUSSED WITHOUT DELAY
WE ARE BUSINESSMEN LIKE YOURSELVES AND KNOW
THE VALUE OF A BUSINESSMAN'S TIME
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME THIS WAY
AND HE OPENED THE DOOR LEADING TO THE ANTE ROOM OF HIS OWN OFFICE
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SEEMED VERY GOOD AT APPROPRIATING EVERYTHING
THAT K
WAS NOW FORCED TO GIVE UP BUT WAS K
NOT GIVING UP MORE THAN
HE ABSOLUTELY HAD TO BY RUNNING OFF TO SOME UNKNOWN PAINTER WITH AS
HE HAD TO ADMIT VERY LITTLE HOPE OF ANY VAGUE BENEFIT HIS RENOWN WAS
SUFFERING DAMAGE THAT COULD NOT ME REPAIRED
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MUCH
BETTER TO TAKE OFF HIS WINTER COAT AGAIN AND AT THE VERY LEAST TRY TO
WIN BACK THE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO WERE CERTAINLY STILL WAITING IN THE NEXT
ROOM
IF K
HAD NOT THEN GLIMPSED THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN HIS OFFICE
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING FROM HIS BOOKSHELVES AS IF THEY WERE HIS OWN HE
WOULD PROBABLY EVEN HAVE MADE THE ATTEMPT
AS K SOMEWHAT AGITATED
APPROACHED THE DOOR THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR CALLED OUT OH YOU'VE STILL
NOT LEFT HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARD HIM ITS MANY DEEP FOLDS SEEMED
TO SHOW STRENGTH RATHER THAN AGE AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN ONCE MORE TO
SEARCH
I'M LOOKING FOR A COPY OF A CONTRACT HE SAID WHICH THIS
GENTLEMAN INSISTS YOU MUST HAVE
COULD YOU HELP ME LOOK FOR IT DO YOU
THINK K
MADE A STEP FORWARD BUT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SAID THANK
YOU I'VE ALREADY FOUND IT AND WITH A BIG PACKAGE OF PAPERS WHICH
CERTAINLY MUST HAVE INCLUDED MANY MORE DOCUMENTS THAN JUST THE COPY OF
THE CONTRACT HE TURNED AND WENT BACK INTO HIS OWN OFFICE
I CAN'T DEAL WITH HIM RIGHT NOW K
SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ONCE
MY PERSONAL DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN SETTLED THEN HE'LL CERTAINLY BE THE
FIRST TO GET THE EFFECT OF IT AND HE CERTAINLY WON'T LIKE IT
SLIGHTLY CALMED BY THESE THOUGHTS K
GAVE THE SERVITOR WHO HAD ALREADY
LONG BEEN HOLDING THE DOOR TO THE CORRIDOR OPEN FOR HIM THE TASK OF
TELLING THE DIRECTOR WHEN HE WAS ABLE THAT K
WAS GOING OUT OF THE
BANK ON A BUSINESS MATTER
AS HE LEFT THE BANK HE FELT ALMOST HAPPY AT
THE THOUGHT OF BEING ABLE TO DEVOTE MORE OF HIMSELF TO HIS OWN BUSINESS
FOR A WHILE
HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PAINTER WHO LIVED IN AN OUTLYING PART OF
TOWN WHICH WAS VERY NEAR TO THE COURT OFFICES ALTHOUGH THIS AREA WAS
EVEN POORER THE HOUSES WERE DARKER THE STREETS WERE FULL OF DIRT THAT
SLOWLY BLEW ABOUT OVER THE HALF MELTED SNOW
IN THE GREAT GATEWAY TO
THE BUILDING WHERE THE PAINTER LIVED ONLY ONE OF THE TWO DOORS WAS OPEN
A HOLE HAD BEEN BROKEN OPEN IN THE WALL BY THE OTHER DOOR AND AS K
APPROACHED IT A REPULSIVE YELLOW STEAMING LIQUID SHOT OUT CAUSING SOME
RATS TO SCURRY AWAY INTO THE NEARBY CANAL
DOWN BY THE STAIRCASE THERE
WAS A SMALL CHILD LYING ON ITS BELLY CRYING BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE
HEARD BECAUSE OF THE NOISE FROM A METAL WORKSHOP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE ENTRANCE HALL DROWNING OUT ANY OTHER SOUND
THE DOOR TO THE
WORKSHOP WAS OPEN THREE WORKERS STOOD IN A CIRCLE AROUND SOME PIECE OF
WORK THAT THEY WERE BEATING WITH HAMMERS
A LARGE TIN PLATE HUNG ON THE
WALL CASTING A PALE LIGHT THAT PUSHED ITS WAY IN BETWEEN TWO OF THE
WORKERS LIGHTING UP THEIR FACES AND THEIR WORK APRONS
K
DID NO MORE
THAN GLANCE AT ANY OF THESE THINGS HE WANTED TO GET THINGS OVER WITH
HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE JUST A FEW WORDS TO FIND OUT HOW
THINGS STOOD WITH THE PAINTER AND GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE BANK
EVEN IF
HE HAD JUST SOME TINY SUCCESS HERE IT WOULD STILL HAVE A GOOD EFFECT ON
HIS WORK AT THE BANK FOR THAT DAY
ON THE THIRD FLOOR HE HAD TO SLOW
DOWN HIS PACE HE WAS QUITE OUT OF BREATH THE STEPS JUST LIKE THE
HEIGHT OF EACH FLOOR WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY NEEDED TO BE AND HE'D
BEEN TOLD THAT THE PAINTER LIVED RIGHT UP IN THE ATTIC
THE AIR WAS
ALSO QUITE OPPRESSIVE THERE WAS NO PROPER STAIRWELL AND THE NARROW
STEPS WERE CLOSED IN BY WALLS ON BOTH SIDES WITH NO MORE THAN A SMALL
HIGH WINDOW HERE AND THERE
JUST AS K
PAUSED FOR A WHILE SOME YOUNG
GIRLS RAN OUT OF ONE OF THE FLATS AND RUSHED HIGHER UP THE STAIRS
LAUGHING
K
FOLLOWED THEM SLOWLY CAUGHT UP WITH ONE OF THE GIRLS WHO
HAD STUMBLED AND BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY THE OTHERS AND ASKED HER AS THEY
WENT UP SIDE BY SIDE IS THERE A PAINTER TITORELLI WHO LIVES HERE
THE GIRL HARDLY THIRTEEN YEARS OLD AND SOMEWHAT HUNCHBACKED JABBED HIM
WITH HER ELBOW AND LOOKED AT HIM SIDEWAYS
HER YOUTH AND HER BODILY
DEFECTS HAD DONE NOTHING TO STOP HER BEING ALREADY QUITE DEPRAVED
SHE
DID NOT SMILE ONCE BUT LOOKED AT K
EARNESTLY WITH SHARP ACQUISITIVE
EYES
K
PRETENDED NOT TO NOTICE HER BEHAVIOUR AND ASKED DO YOU KNOW
TITORELLI THE PAINTER SHE NODDED AND ASKED IN REPLY WHAT D'YOU
WANT TO SEE HIM FOR K
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE TO HIS ADVANTAGE QUICKLY
TO FIND OUT SOMETHING MORE ABOUT TITORELLI
I WANT TO HAVE HIM PAINT
MY PORTRAIT HE SAID
PAINT YOUR PORTRAIT SHE ASKED OPENING HER
MOUTH TOO WIDE AND LIGHTLY HITTING K
WITH HER HAND AS IF HE HAD SAID
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARILY SURPRISING OR CLUMSY WITH BOTH HANDS SHE
LIFTED HER SKIRT WHICH WAS ALREADY VERY SHORT AND AS FAST AS SHE
COULD SHE RAN OFF AFTER THE OTHER GIRLS WHOSE INDISTINCT SHOUTS LOST
THEMSELVES IN THE HEIGHTS
AT THE NEXT TURN OF THE STAIRS HOWEVER K
ENCOUNTERED ALL THE GIRLS ONCE MORE
THE HUNCHBACKED GIRL HAD CLEARLY
TOLD THEM ABOUT K 'S INTENTIONS AND THEY WERE WAITING FOR HIM
THEY
STOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE STAIRS PRESSING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE WALL
SO THAT K
COULD GET THROUGH BETWEEN THEM AND SMOOTHED THEIR APRONS
DOWN WITH THEIR HANDS
ALL THEIR FACES EVEN IN THIS GUARD OF HONOUR
SHOWED A MIXTURE OF CHILDISHNESS AND DEPRAVITY
UP AT THE HEAD OF THE
LINE OF GIRLS WHO NOW LAUGHING BEGAN TO CLOSE IN AROUND K WAS THE
HUNCHBACK WHO HAD TAKEN ON THE ROLE OF LEADER
IT WAS THANKS TO HER
THAT K
FOUND THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITHOUT DELAY HE WOULD HAVE
CONTINUED UP THE STAIRS STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM BUT SHE SHOWED HIM
THAT TO REACH TITORELLI HE WOULD NEED TO TURN OFF TO ONE SIDE
THE STEPS THAT LED UP TO THE PAINTER WERE ESPECIALLY NARROW VERY LONG
WITHOUT ANY TURNING THE WHOLE LENGTH COULD BE SEEN IN ONE GLANCE AND
AT THE TOP AT TITORELLI'S CLOSED DOOR IT CAME TO ITS END
THIS DOOR
WAS MUCH BETTER ILLUMINATED THAN THE REST OF THE STAIRWAY BY THE LIGHT
FROM A SMALL SKYLIGHT SET OBLIQUELY ABOVE IT IT HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER
FROM UNPAINTED PLANKS OF WOOD AND THE NAME 'TITORELLI' WAS PAINTED ON IT
IN BROAD RED BRUSHSTROKES
K
WAS NO MORE THAN HALF WAY UP THE STEPS
ACCOMPANIED BY HIS RETINUE OF GIRLS WHEN CLEARLY THE RESULT OF THE
NOISE OF ALL THOSE FOOTSTEPS THE DOOR OPENED SLIGHTLY AND IN THE CRACK
A MAN WHO SEEMED TO BE DRESSED IN JUST HIS NIGHTSHIRT APPEARED
OH
HE CRIED WHEN HE SAW THE APPROACHING CROWD AND VANISHED
THE
HUNCHBACKED GIRL CLAPPED HER HANDS IN GLEE AND THE OTHER GIRLS CROWDED
IN BEHIND K
TO PUSH HIM FASTER FORWARD
THEY STILL HAD NOT ARRIVED AT THE TOP HOWEVER WHEN THE PAINTER
UP ABOVE THEM SUDDENLY PULLED THE DOOR WIDE OPEN AND WITH A DEEP BOW
INVITED K
TO ENTER
THE GIRLS ON THE OTHER HAND HE TRIED TO KEEP
AWAY HE DID NOT WANT TO LET ANY OF THEM IN HOWEVER MUCH THEY BEGGED HIM
AND HOWEVER MUCH THEY TRIED TO GET IN IF THEY COULD NOT GET IN WITH
HIS PERMISSION THEY WOULD TRY TO FORCE THEIR WAY IN AGAINST HIS WILL
THE ONLY ONE TO SUCCEED WAS THE HUNCHBACK WHEN SHE SLIPPED THROUGH UNDER
HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM BUT THE PAINTER CHASED AFTER HER GRABBED HER BY
THE SKIRT SPAN HER ONCE ROUND AND SET HER DOWN AGAIN BY THE DOOR WITH
THE OTHER GIRLS WHO UNLIKE THE FIRST HAD NOT DARED TO CROSS THE
DOORSTEP WHILE THE PAINTER HAD LEFT HIS POST
K
DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE
WAS TO MAKE OF ALL THIS AS THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE HAVING FUN
ONE
BEHIND THE OTHER THE GIRLS BY THE DOOR STRETCHED THEIR NECKS UP HIGH
AND CALLED OUT VARIOUS WORDS TO THE PAINTER WHICH WERE MEANT IN JEST BUT
WHICH K
DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND EVEN THE PAINTER LAUGHED AS THE
HUNCHBACK WHIRLED ROUND IN HIS HAND
THEN HE SHUT THE DOOR BOWED ONCE
MORE TO K OFFERED HIM HIS HAND AND INTRODUCED HIMSELF SAYING
TITORELLI PAINTER
K
POINTED TO THE DOOR BEHIND WHICH THE GIRLS
WERE WHISPERING AND SAID YOU SEEM TO BE VERY POPULAR IN THIS
BUILDING ACH THOSE BRATS SAID THE PAINTER TRYING IN VAIN TO
FASTEN HIS NIGHTSHIRT AT THE NECK
HE WAS ALSO BARE FOOTED AND APART
FROM THAT WAS WEARING NOTHING MORE THAN A LOOSE PAIR OF YELLOWISH LINEN
TROUSERS HELD UP WITH A BELT WHOSE FREE END WHIPPED TO AND FRO
THOSE
KIDS ARE A REAL BURDEN FOR ME HE CONTINUED
THE TOP BUTTON OF HIS
NIGHTSHIRT CAME OFF AND HE GAVE UP TRYING TO FASTEN IT FETCHED A CHAIR
FOR K
AND MADE HIM SIT DOWN ON IT
I PAINTED ONE OF THEM ONCE SHE'S
NOT HERE TODAY AND EVER SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ME ABOUT
IF I'M HERE THEY ONLY COME IN WHEN I ALLOW IT BUT AS SOON AS I'VE GONE
OUT THERE'S ALWAYS AT LEAST ONE OF THEM IN HERE
THEY HAD A KEY MADE TO
MY DOOR AND LEND IT ROUND TO EACH OTHER
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT A
PAIN THAT IS
SUPPOSE I COME BACK HOME WITH A LADY I'M GOING TO PAINT
I OPEN THE DOOR WITH MY OWN KEY AND FIND THE HUNCHBACK THERE OR
SOMETHING BY THE TABLE PAINTING HER LIPS RED WITH MY PAINTBRUSH AND
MEANWHILE HER LITTLE SISTERS WILL BE KEEPING GUARD FOR HER MOVING ABOUT
AND CAUSING CHAOS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE ROOM
OR ELSE LIKE HAPPENED
YESTERDAY I MIGHT COME BACK HOME LATE IN THE EVENING PLEASE FORGIVE
MY APPEARANCE AND THE ROOM BEING IN A MESS IT IS TO DO WITH THEM SO
I MIGHT COME HOME LATE IN THE EVENING AND WANT TO GO TO BED THEN I FEEL
SOMETHING PINCHING MY LEG LOOK UNDER THE BED AND PULL ANOTHER OF THEM
OUT FROM UNDER IT
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS THEY BOTHER ME LIKE THIS I
EXPECT YOU'VE JUST SEEN THAT I DO NOTHING TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO COME NEAR
ME
AND THEY MAKE IT HARD FOR ME TO DO MY WORK TOO OF COURSE
IF I
DIDN'T GET THIS STUDIO FOR NOTHING I'D HAVE MOVED OUT A LONG TIME AGO
JUST THEN A LITTLE VOICE TENDER AND ANXIOUS CALLED OUT FROM UNDER THE
DOOR TITORELLI CAN WE COME IN NOW NO ANSWERED THE PAINTER
NOT EVEN JUST ME BY MYSELF THE VOICE ASKED AGAIN
NOT EVEN JUST
YOU SAID THE PAINTER AS HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND LOCKED IT
MEANWHILE K
HAD BEEN LOOKING ROUND THE ROOM IF IT HAD NOT BEEN
POINTED OUT IT WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THIS WRETCHED
LITTLE ROOM COULD BE CALLED A STUDIO
IT WAS HARDLY LONG ENOUGH OR
BROAD ENOUGH TO MAKE TWO STEPS
EVERYTHING FLOOR WALLS AND CEILING
WAS MADE OF WOOD BETWEEN THE PLANKS NARROW GAPS COULD BE SEEN
ACROSS
FROM WHERE K
WAS THE BED STOOD AGAINST THE WALL UNDER A COVERING OF
MANY DIFFERENT COLOURS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM A PICTURE STOOD ON AN
EASEL COVERED OVER WITH A SHIRT WHOSE ARMS DANGLED DOWN TO THE GROUND
BEHIND K
WAS THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH THE FOG MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE
FURTHER THAN THE SNOW COVERED ROOF OF THE NEIGHBOURING BUILDING
THE TURNING OF THE KEY IN THE LOCK REMINDED K
THAT HE HAD NOT
WANTED TO STAY TOO LONG
SO HE DREW THE MANUFACTURER'S LETTER OUT FROM
HIS POCKET HELD IT OUT TO THE PAINTER AND SAID I LEARNED ABOUT YOU
FROM THIS GENTLEMAN AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS AND IT'S ON HIS ADVICE
THAT I'VE COME HERE
THE PAINTER GLANCED THROUGH THE LETTER AND THREW
IT DOWN ONTO THE BED
IF THE MANUFACTURER HAD NOT SAID VERY CLEARLY
THAT TITORELLI WAS AN ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS A POOR MAN WHO WAS DEPENDENT
ON HIS CHARITY THEN IT WOULD REALLY HAVE BEEN QUITE POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
THAT TITORELLI DID NOT KNOW HIM OR AT LEAST THAT HE COULD NOT REMEMBER
HIM
THIS IMPRESSION WAS AUGMENTED BY THE PAINTER'S ASKING WERE YOU
WANTING TO BUY SOME PICTURES OR DID YOU WANT TO HAVE YOURSELF PAINTED
K
LOOKED AT THE PAINTER IN ASTONISHMENT
WHAT DID THE LETTER ACTUALLY
SAY K
HAD TAKEN IT AS A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD
EXPLAINED TO THE PAINTER IN HIS LETTER THAT K
WANTED NOTHING MORE WITH
HIM THAN TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HIS TRIAL
HE HAD BEEN FAR TOO RASH IN
COMING HERE BUT NOW HE HAD TO GIVE THE PAINTER SOME SORT OF ANSWER
AND GLANCING AT THE EASEL SAID ARE YOU WORKING ON A PICTURE
CURRENTLY YES SAID THE PAINTER AND HE TOOK THE SHIRT HANGING OVER
THE EASEL AND THREW IT ONTO THE BED AFTER THE LETTER
IT'S A PORTRAIT
QUITE A GOOD PIECE OF WORK ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT QUITE FINISHED YET THIS
WAS A CONVENIENT COINCIDENCE FOR K IT GAVE HIM A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO
TALK ABOUT THE COURT AS THE PICTURE SHOWED VERY CLEARLY A JUDGE
WHAT'S MORE IT WAS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THE PICTURE IN THE LAWYER'S
OFFICE ALTHOUGH THIS ONE SHOWED A QUITE DIFFERENT JUDGE A HEAVY MAN
WITH A FULL BEARD WHICH WAS BLACK AND BUSHY AND EXTENDED TO THE SIDES
FAR UP THE MAN'S CHEEKS
THE LAWYER'S PICTURE WAS ALSO AN OIL PAINTING
WHEREAS THIS ONE HAD BEEN MADE WITH PASTEL COLOURS AND WAS PALE AND
UNCLEAR
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE PICTURE WAS SIMILAR AS THIS
JUDGE TOO WAS HOLDING TIGHTLY TO THE ARM OF HIS THRONE AND SEEMED
OMINOUSLY ABOUT TO RISE FROM IT
AT FIRST K
WAS ABOUT TO SAY HE
CERTAINLY IS A JUDGE BUT HE HELD HIMSELF BACK FOR THE TIME BEING AND
WENT CLOSER TO THE PICTURE AS IF HE WANTED TO STUDY IT IN DETAIL
THERE
WAS A LARGE FIGURE SHOWN IN MIDDLE OF THE THRONE'S BACK REST WHICH K
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AND ASKED THE PAINTER ABOUT IT
THAT'LL NEED SOME
MORE WORK DONE ON IT THE PAINTER TOLD HIM AND TAKING A PASTEL CRAYON
FROM A SMALL TABLE HE ADDED A FEW STROKES TO THE EDGES OF THE FIGURE BUT
WITHOUT MAKING IT ANY CLEARER AS FAR AS K
COULD MAKE OUT
THAT'S THE
FIGURE OF JUSTICE SAID THE PAINTER FINALLY
NOW I SEE SAID K
HERE'S THE BLINDFOLD AND HERE ARE THE SCALES
BUT AREN'T THOSE WINGS
ON HER HEELS AND ISN'T SHE MOVING YES SAID THE PAINTER I HAD TO
PAINT IT LIKE THAT ACCORDING TO THE CONTRACT
IT'S ACTUALLY THE FIGURE
OF JUSTICE AND THE GODDESS OF VICTORY ALL IN ONE THAT IS NOT A GOOD
COMBINATION SAID K
WITH A SMILE
JUSTICE NEEDS TO REMAIN STILL
OTHERWISE THE SCALES WILL MOVE ABOUT AND IT WON'T BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE A
JUST VERDICT I'M JUST DOING WHAT THE CLIENT WANTED SAID THE
PAINTER
YES CERTAINLY SAID K WHO HAD NOT MEANT TO CRITICISE
ANYONE BY THAT COMMENT
YOU'VE PAINTED THE FIGURE AS IT ACTUALLY
APPEARS ON THE THRONE NO SAID THE PAINTER I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT
FIGURE OR THAT THRONE IT'S ALL JUST INVENTION BUT THEY TOLD ME WHAT IT
WAS I HAD TO PAINT HOW'S THAT ASKED K
PRETENDING NOT FULLY TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PAINTER SAID
THAT IS A JUDGE SITTING ON THE
JUDGE'S CHAIR ISN'T IT YES SAID THE PAINTER BUT THAT JUDGE
ISN'T VERY HIGH UP AND HE'S NEVER SAT ON ANY THRONE LIKE THAT AND HE
HAS HIMSELF PAINTED IN SUCH A GRAND POSE HE'S SITTING THERE JUST LIKE
THE PRESIDENT OF THE COURT YEAH GENTLEMEN LIKE THIS ARE VERY VAIN
SAID THE PAINTER
BUT THEY HAVE PERMISSION FROM HIGHER UP TO GET
THEMSELVES PAINTED LIKE THIS
IT'S LAID DOWN QUITE STRICTLY JUST WHAT
SORT OF PORTRAIT EACH OF THEM CAN GET FOR HIMSELF
ONLY IT'S A PITY
THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE OUT THE DETAILS OF HIS COSTUME AND POSE IN THIS
PICTURE PASTEL COLOURS AREN'T REALLY SUITABLE FOR SHOWING PEOPLE LIKE
THIS YES SAID K IT DOES SEEM ODD THAT IT'S IN PASTEL COLOURS
THAT'S WHAT THE JUDGE WANTED SAID THE PAINTER IT'S MEANT TO BE FOR
A WOMAN THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURE SEEMED TO MAKE HIM FEEL LIKE
WORKING HE ROLLED UP HIS SHIRTSLEEVES PICKED UP A FEW OF THE CRAYONS
AND K
WATCHED AS A REDDISH SHADOW BUILT UP AROUND THE HEAD OF THE JUDGE
UNDER THEIR QUIVERING TIPS AND RADIATED OUT THE TO EDGES OF THE PICTURE
THIS SHADOW PLAY SLOWLY SURROUNDED THE HEAD LIKE A DECORATION OR LOFTY
DISTINCTION
BUT AROUND THE FIGURE OF JUSTICE APART FROM SOME
COLORATION THAT WAS BARELY NOTICEABLE IT REMAINED LIGHT AND IN THIS
BRIGHTNESS THE FIGURE SEEMED TO SHINE FORWARD SO THAT IT NOW LOOKED LIKE
NEITHER THE GOD OF JUSTICE NOR THE GOD OF VICTORY IT SEEMED NOW
RATHER TO BE A PERFECT DEPICTION OF THE GOD OF THE HUNT
K
FOUND THE
PAINTER'S WORK MORE ENGROSSING THAN HE HAD WANTED BUT FINALLY HE
REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR STAYING SO LONG WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING
RELEVANT TO HIS OWN AFFAIR
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS JUDGE HE ASKED
SUDDENLY
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL YOU THAT THE PAINTER ANSWERED
HE
WAS BENT DEEPLY OVER THE PICTURE AND CLEARLY NEGLECTING HIS GUEST WHO
AT FIRST HE HAD RECEIVED WITH SUCH CARE
K
TOOK THIS TO BE JUST A
FOIBLE OF THE PAINTER'S AND IT IRRITATED HIM AS IT MADE HIM LOSE TIME
I TAKE IT YOU MUST BE A TRUSTEE OF THE COURT HE SAID
THE PAINTER
IMMEDIATELY PUT HIS CRAYONS DOWN STOOD UPRIGHT RUBBED HIS HANDS
TOGETHER AND LOOKED AT K
WITH A SMILE
ALWAYS STRAIGHT OUT WITH THE
TRUTH HE SAID
YOU WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THE COURT LIKE IT
SAYS IN YOUR LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION BUT THEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT
MY PICTURES TO GET ME ON YOUR SIDE
STILL I WON'T HOLD IT AGAINST YOU
YOU WEREN'T TO KNOW THAT THAT WAS ENTIRELY THE WRONG THING TO TRY WITH
ME
OH PLEASE HE SAID SHARPLY REPELLING K 'S ATTEMPT TO MAKE SOME
OBJECTION
HE THEN CONTINUED AND BESIDES YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT IN YOUR
COMMENT THAT I'M A TRUSTEE OF THE COURT HE MADE A PAUSE AS IF
WANTING TO GIVE K
THE TIME TO COME TO TERMS WITH THIS FACT
THE GIRLS
COULD ONCE MORE BE HEARD FROM BEHIND THE DOOR
THEY WERE PROBABLY
PRESSED AROUND THE KEYHOLE PERHAPS THEY COULD EVEN SEE INTO THE ROOM
THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE PLANKS
K
FOREWENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCUSE
HIMSELF IN SOME WAY AS HE DID NOT WISH TO DISTRACT THE PAINTER FROM WHAT
HE WAS SAYING OR ELSE PERHAPS HE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO GET TOO FAR ABOVE
HIMSELF AND IN THIS WAY MAKE HIMSELF TO SOME EXTENT UNATTAINABLE SO HE
ASKED IS THAT A PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED POSITION NO WAS THE
PAINTER'S CURT REPLY AS IF THE QUESTION PREVENTED HIM SAYING ANY MORE
BUT K
WANTED HIM TO CONTINUE SPEAKING AND SAID WELL POSITIONS LIKE
THAT THAT AREN'T OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED CAN OFTEN HAVE MORE INFLUENCE
THAN THOSE THAT ARE AND THAT'S HOW IT IS WITH ME SAID THE PAINTER
AND NODDED WITH A FROWN
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR CASE WITH THE
MANUFACTURER YESTERDAY AND HE ASKED ME IF I WOULDN'T LIKE TO HELP YOU
AND I ANSWERED 'HE CAN COME AND SEE ME IF HE LIKES' AND NOW I'M
PLEASED TO SEE YOU HERE SO SOON
THIS BUSINESS SEEMS TO BE QUITE
IMPORTANT TO YOU AND OF COURSE I'M NOT SURPRISED AT THAT
WOULD YOU
NOT LIKE TO TAKE YOUR COAT OFF NOW K
HAD INTENDED TO STAY FOR ONLY A
VERY SHORT TIME BUT THE PAINTER'S INVITATION WAS NONETHELESS VERY
WELCOME
THE AIR IN THE ROOM HAD SLOWLY BECOME QUITE OPPRESSIVE FOR
HIM HE HAD SEVERAL TIMES LOOKED IN AMAZEMENT AT A SMALL IRON STOVE IN
THE CORNER THAT CERTAINLY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LIT THE HEAT OF THE ROOM
WAS INEXPLICABLE
AS HE TOOK OFF HIS WINTER OVERCOAT AND ALSO
UNBUTTONED HIS FROCK COAT THE PAINTER SAID TO HIM IN APOLOGY I MUST
HAVE WARMTH
AND IT IS VERY COSY HERE ISN'T IT
THIS ROOM'S VERY GOOD
IN THAT RESPECT K
MADE NO REPLY BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT THE HEAT
THAT MADE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE BUT MUCH MORE THE STUFFINESS THE AIR THAT
ALMOST MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO BREATHE THE ROOM HAD PROBABLY NOT BEEN
VENTILATED FOR A LONG TIME
THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF THIS WAS MADE ALL THE
STRONGER FOR K
WHEN THE PAINTER INVITED HIM TO SIT ON THE BED WHILE HE
HIMSELF SAT DOWN ON THE ONLY CHAIR IN THE ROOM IN FRONT OF THE EASEL
THE PAINTER EVEN SEEMED TO MISUNDERSTAND WHY K
REMAINED AT THE EDGE OF
THE BED AND URGED K
TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE AND AS HE HESITATED HE
WENT OVER TO THE BED HIMSELF AND PRESSED K
DEEP DOWN INTO THE
BEDCLOTHES AND PILLOWS
THEN HE WENT BACK TO HIS SEAT AND AT LAST HE
ASKED HIS FIRST OBJECTIVE QUESTION WHICH MADE K
FORGET EVERYTHING
ELSE
YOU'RE INNOCENT ARE YOU HE ASKED
YES SAID K
HE FELT A
SIMPLE JOY AT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION ESPECIALLY AS THE ANSWER WAS
GIVEN TO A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL AND THEREFORE WOULD HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES
UP TILL THEN NO ONE HAD ASKED HIM THIS QUESTION SO OPENLY
TO MAKE THE
MOST OF HIS PLEASURE HE ADDED I AM TOTALLY INNOCENT SO SAID THE
PAINTER AND HE LOWERED HIS HEAD AND SEEMED TO BE THINKING
SUDDENLY HE
RAISED HIS HEAD AGAIN AND SAID WELL IF YOU'RE INNOCENT IT'S ALL VERY
SIMPLE K
BEGAN TO SCOWL THIS SUPPOSED TRUSTEE OF THE COURT WAS
TALKING LIKE AN IGNORANT CHILD
MY BEING INNOCENT DOES NOT MAKE THINGS
SIMPLE SAID K
DESPITE EVERYTHING HE COULDN'T HELP SMILING AND
SLOWLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
THERE ARE MANY FINE DETAILS IN WHICH THE COURT
GETS LOST BUT IN THE END IT REACHES INTO SOME PLACE WHERE ORIGINALLY
THERE WAS NOTHING AND PULLS ENORMOUS GUILT OUT OF IT YEAH YEAH
SURE SAID THE PAINTER AS IF K
HAD BEEN DISTURBING HIS TRAIN OF
THOUGHT FOR NO REASON
BUT YOU ARE INNOCENT AREN'T YOU WELL OF
COURSE I AM SAID K
THAT'S THE MAIN THING SAID THE PAINTER
THERE
WAS NO COUNTER ARGUMENT THAT COULD INFLUENCE HIM BUT ALTHOUGH HE HAD
MADE UP HIS MIND IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER HE WAS TALKING THIS WAY
BECAUSE OF CONVICTION OR INDIFFERENCE
K THEN WANTED TO FIND OUT AND
SAID THEREFORE I'M SURE YOU'RE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE COURT THAN I AM
I KNOW HARDLY MORE ABOUT IT THAN WHAT I'VE HEARD AND THAT'S BEEN FROM
MANY VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE
BUT THEY WERE ALL AGREED ON ONE THING AND
THAT WAS THAT WHEN ILL THOUGHT OUT ACCUSATIONS ARE MADE THEY ARE NOT
IGNORED AND THAT ONCE THE COURT HAS MADE AN ACCUSATION IT IS CONVINCED
OF THE GUILT OF THE DEFENDANT AND IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE IT THINK
OTHERWISE VERY HARD THE PAINTER ASKED THROWING ONE HAND UP IN THE
AIR
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT THINK OTHERWISE
IF I PAINTED ALL THE
JUDGES NEXT TO EACH OTHER HERE ON CANVAS AND YOU WERE TRYING TO DEFEND
YOURSELF IN FRONT OF IT YOU'D HAVE MORE SUCCESS WITH THEM THAN YOU'D
EVER HAVE WITH THE REAL COURT YES SAID K
TO HIMSELF FORGETTING
THAT HE HAD ONLY GONE THERE TO INVESTIGATE THE PAINTER
ONE OF THE GIRLS BEHIND THE DOOR STARTED UP AGAIN AND ASKED
TITORELLI IS HE GOING TO GO SOON QUIET SHOUTED THE PAINTER AT
THE DOOR CAN'T YOU SEE I'M TALKING WITH THE GENTLEMAN BUT THIS WAS
NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE GIRL AND SHE ASKED YOU GOING TO PAINT HIS
PICTURE AND WHEN THE PAINTER DIDN'T ANSWER SHE ADDED PLEASE DON'T
PAINT HIM HE'S AN 'ORRIBLE BLOKE THERE FOLLOWED AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE
INTERWOVEN BABBLE OF SHOUTS AND REPLIES AND CALLS OF AGREEMENT
THE
PAINTER LEAPT OVER TO THE DOOR OPENED IT VERY SLIGHTLY THE GIRLS'
CLASPED HANDS COULD BE SEEN STRETCHING THROUGH THE CRACK AS IF THEY
WANTED SOMETHING AND SAID IF YOU'RE NOT QUIET I'LL THROW YOU ALL
DOWN THE STAIRS
SIT DOWN HERE ON THE STEPS AND BE QUIET THEY
PROBABLY DID NOT OBEY HIM IMMEDIATELY SO THAT HE HAD TO COMMAND DOWN
ON THE STEPS ONLY THEN IT BECAME QUIET
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT SAID THE PAINTER AS HE RETURNED TO K
K
HAD HARDLY TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR HE HAD LEFT IT COMPLETELY UP TO THE
PAINTER WHETHER AND HOW HE WOULD PLACE HIM UNDER HIS PROTECTION IF HE
WANTED TO
EVEN NOW HE MADE HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT AS THE PAINTER BENT
OVER HIM AND WHISPERING INTO HIS EAR IN ORDER NOT TO BE HEARD OUTSIDE
SAID THESE GIRLS BELONG TO THE COURT AS WELL HOW'S THAT ASKED
K AS HE LEANT HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND LOOKED AT THE PAINTER
BUT THE
PAINTER SAT BACK DOWN ON HIS CHAIR AND HALF IN JEST HALF IN
EXPLANATION WELL EVERYTHING BELONGS TO THE COURT THAT IS
SOMETHING I HAD NEVER NOTICED UNTIL NOW SAID K
CURTLY THIS GENERAL
COMMENT OF THE PAINTER'S MADE HIS COMMENT ABOUT THE GIRLS FAR LESS
DISTURBING
NONETHELESS K
LOOKED FOR A WHILE AT THE DOOR BEHIND
WHICH THE GIRLS WERE NOW SITTING QUIETLY ON THE STEPS
EXCEPT THAT ONE
OF THEM HAD PUSHED A DRINKING STRAW THROUGH A CRACK BETWEEN THE PLANKS
AND WAS MOVING IT SLOWLY UP AND DOWN
YOU STILL DON'T SEEM TO HAVE
MUCH GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT THE COURT'S ABOUT SAID THE PAINTER WHO HAD
STRETCHED HIS LEGS WIDE APART AND WAS TAPPING LOUDLY ON THE FLOOR WITH
THE TIP OF HIS FOOT
BUT AS YOU'RE INNOCENT YOU WON'T NEED IT ANYWAY
I'LL GET YOU OUT OF THIS BY MYSELF HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DO THAT
ASKED K
YOU DID SAY YOURSELF NOT LONG AGO THAT IT'S QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
TO GO TO THE COURT WITH REASONS AND PROOFS ONLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR
REASONS AND PROOFS YOU TAKE TO THE COURT YOURSELF SAID THE PAINTER
RAISING HIS FOREFINGER AS IF K
HAD FAILED TO NOTICE A FINE DISTINCTION
IT GOES DIFFERENTLY IF YOU TRY TO DO SOMETHING BEHIND THE PUBLIC COURT
THAT'S TO SAY IN THE CONSULTATION ROOMS IN THE CORRIDORS OR HERE FOR
INSTANCE IN MY STUDIO K
NOW BEGAN TO FIND IT FAR EASIER TO BELIEVE
WHAT THE PAINTER WAS SAYING OR RATHER IT WAS LARGELY IN AGREEMENT WITH
WHAT HE HAD ALSO BEEN TOLD BY OTHERS
IN FACT IT WAS EVEN QUITE
PROMISING
IF IT REALLY WAS SO EASY TO INFLUENCE THE JUDGES THROUGH
PERSONAL CONTACTS AS THE LAWYER HAD SAID THEN THE PAINTER'S CONTACTS
WITH THESE VAIN JUDGES WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND AT THE VERY LEAST
SHOULD NOT BE UNDERVALUED
AND THE PAINTER WOULD FIT IN VERY WELL IN
THE CIRCLE OF ASSISTANTS THAT K
WAS SLOWLY GATHERING AROUND HIMSELF
HE HAD BEEN NOTED AT THE BANK FOR HIS TALENT IN ORGANISING HERE WHERE
HE WAS PLACED ENTIRELY ON HIS OWN RESOURCES WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY
TO TEST THAT TALENT TO ITS LIMITS
THE PAINTER OBSERVED THE EFFECT HIS
EXPLANATION HAD HAD ON K
AND THEN WITH A CERTAIN UNEASE SAID DOES
IT NOT OCCUR TO YOU THAT THE WAY I'M SPEAKING IS ALMOST LIKE A LAWYER
IT'S THE INCESSANT CONTACT WITH THE GENTLEMEN OF THE COURT HAS THAT
INFLUENCE ON ME
I GAIN A LOT BY IT OF COURSE BUT I LOSE A LOT
ARTISTICALLY SPEAKING HOW DID YOU FIRST COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE
JUDGES THEN ASKED K HE WANTED FIRST TO GAIN THE PAINTER'S TRUST
BEFORE HE TOOK HIM INTO HIS SERVICE
THAT WAS VERY EASY SAID THE
PAINTER I INHERITED THESE CONTACTS
MY FATHER WAS COURT PAINTER
BEFORE ME
IT'S A POSITION THAT'S ALWAYS INHERITED
THEY CAN'T USE NEW
PEOPLE FOR IT THE RULES GOVERNING HOW THE VARIOUS GRADES OF OFFICIALS
ARE PAINTED ARE SO MANY AND VARIED AND ABOVE ALL SO SECRET THAT NO
ONE OUTSIDE OF CERTAIN FAMILIES EVEN KNOWS THEM
IN THE DRAWER THERE
FOR INSTANCE I'VE GOT MY FATHER'S NOTES WHICH I DON'T SHOW TO ANYONE
BUT YOU'RE ONLY ABLE TO PAINT JUDGES IF YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ALTHOUGH EVEN IF I LOST THEM NO ONE COULD EVER DISPUTE MY POSITION
BECAUSE OF ALL THE RULES I JUST CARRY ROUND IN MY HEAD
ALL THE JUDGES
WANT TO BE PAINTED LIKE THE OLD GREAT JUDGES WERE AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN DO THAT YOU ARE TO BE ENVIED SAID K THINKING OF HIS
POSITION AT THE BANK
YOUR POSITION IS QUITE UNASSAILABLE THEN
YES QUITE UNASSAILABLE SAID THE PAINTER AND HE RAISED HIS SHOULDERS
IN PRIDE
THAT'S HOW I CAN EVEN AFFORD TO HELP SOME POOR MAN FACING
TRIAL NOW AND THEN AND HOW DO YOU DO THAT ASKED K AS IF THE
PAINTER HAD NOT JUST DESCRIBED HIM AS A POOR MAN
THE PAINTER DID NOT
LET HIMSELF BE DISTRACTED BUT SAID IN YOUR CASE FOR INSTANCE AS
YOU'RE TOTALLY INNOCENT THIS IS WHAT I'LL DO THE REPEATED MENTION OF
K 'S INNOCENCE WAS BECOMING IRKSOME TO HIM
IT SOMETIMES SEEMED TO HIM
AS IF THE PAINTER WAS USING THESE COMMENTS TO MAKE A FAVOURABLE OUTCOME
TO THE TRIAL A PRECONDITION FOR HIS HELP WHICH OF COURSE WOULD MAKE THE
HELP ITSELF UNNECESSARY
BUT DESPITE THESE DOUBTS K
FORCED HIMSELF NOT
TO INTERRUPT THE PAINTER
HE DID NOT WANT TO DO WITHOUT THE PAINTER'S
HELP THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD DECIDED AND THIS HELP DID NOT SEEM IN ANY
WAY LESS QUESTIONABLE THAN THAT OF THE LAWYER
K
VALUED THE PAINTER'S
HELP FAR MORE HIGHLY BECAUSE IT WAS OFFERED IN A WAY THAT WAS MORE
HARMLESS AND OPEN
THE PAINTER HAD PULLED HIS SEAT CLOSER TO THE BED AND CONTINUED IN
A SUBDUED VOICE I FORGOT TO ASK YOU WHAT SORT OF ACQUITTAL IS IT YOU
WANT THERE ARE THREE POSSIBILITIES ABSOLUTE ACQUITTAL APPARENT
ACQUITTAL AND DEFERMENT
ABSOLUTE ACQUITTAL IS THE BEST OF COURSE
ONLY THERE'S NOTHING I COULD DO TO GET THAT SORT OF OUTCOME
I DON'T
THINK THERE'S ANYONE AT ALL WHO COULD DO ANYTHING TO GET AN ABSOLUTE
ACQUITTAL
PROBABLY THE ONLY THING THAT COULD DO THAT IS IF THE ACCUSED
IS INNOCENT
AS YOU ARE INNOCENT IT COULD ACTUALLY BE POSSIBLE AND YOU
COULD DEPEND ON YOUR INNOCENCE ALONE
IN THAT CASE YOU WON'T NEED ME OR
ANY OTHER KIND OF HELP
AT FIRST K
WAS ASTONISHED AT THIS ORDERLY EXPLANATION BUT THEN
JUST AS QUIETLY AS THE PAINTER HE SAID I THINK YOU'RE CONTRADICTING
YOURSELF HOW'S THAT ASKED THE PAINTER PATIENTLY LEANING BACK WITH
A SMILE
THIS SMILE MADE K
FEEL AS IF HE WERE EXAMINING NOT THE WORDS
OF THE PAINTER BUT SEEKING OUT INCONSISTENCIES IN THE PROCEDURES OF THE
COURT ITSELF
NONETHELESS HE CONTINUED UNABASHED AND SAID YOU
REMARKED EARLIER THAT THE COURT CANNOT BE APPROACHED WITH REASONED
PROOFS YOU LATER RESTRICTED THIS TO THE OPEN COURT AND NOW YOU GO SO
FAR AS TO SAY THAT AN INNOCENT MAN NEEDS NO ASSISTANCE IN COURT
THAT
ENTAILS A CONTRADICTION
MOREOVER YOU SAID EARLIER THAT THE JUDGES CAN
BE INFLUENCED PERSONALLY BUT NOW YOU INSIST THAT AN ABSOLUTE ACQUITTAL
AS YOU CALL IT CAN NEVER BE ATTAINED THROUGH PERSONAL INFLUENCE
THAT
ENTAILS A SECOND CONTRADICTION IT'S QUITE EASY TO CLEAR UP THESE
CONTRADICTIONS SAID THE PAINTER
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT
THINGS HERE THERE'S WHAT IT SAYS IN THE LAW AND THERE'S WHAT I KNOW
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE YOU SHOULDN'T GET THE TWO CONFUSED
I'VE NEVER
SEEN IT IN WRITING BUT THE LAW DOES OF COURSE SAY ON THE ONE HAND
THAT THE INNOCENT WILL BE SET FREE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT DOESN'T SAY
THAT THE JUDGES CAN BE INFLUENCED
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S THE OTHER
WAY ROUND
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY ABSOLUTE ACQUITTALS BUT I DO KNOW OF
MANY TIMES WHEN A JUDGE HAS BEEN INFLUENCED
IT'S POSSIBLE OF COURSE
THAT THERE WAS NO INNOCENCE IN ANY OF THE CASES I KNOW ABOUT
BUT IS
THAT LIKELY NOT A SINGLE INNOCENT DEFENDANT IN SO MANY CASES WHEN I
WAS A BOY I USED TO LISTEN CLOSELY TO MY FATHER WHEN HE TOLD US ABOUT
COURT CASES AT HOME AND THE JUDGES THAT CAME TO HIS STUDIO TALKED ABOUT
THE COURT IN OUR CIRCLES NOBODY TALKS ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE I HARDLY
EVER GOT THE CHANCE TO GO TO COURT MYSELF BUT ALWAYS MADE USE OF IT WHEN
I COULD I'VE LISTENED TO COUNTLESS TRIALS AT IMPORTANT STAGES IN THEIR
DEVELOPMENT I'VE FOLLOWED THEM CLOSELY AS FAR AS THEY COULD BE
FOLLOWED AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE ACQUITTAL
SO
NOT A SINGLE ACQUITTAL SAID K AS IF TALKING TO HIMSELF AND HIS
HOPES
THAT CONFIRMS THE IMPRESSION I ALREADY HAVE OF THE COURT
SO
THERE'S NO POINT IN IT FROM THIS SIDE EITHER
THEY COULD REPLACE THE
WHOLE COURT WITH A SINGLE HANGMAN YOU SHOULDN'T GENERALISE SAID
THE PAINTER DISSATISFIED I'VE ONLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT MY OWN
EXPERIENCE WELL THAT'S ENOUGH SAID K OR HAVE YOU HEARD OF ANY
ACQUITTALS THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THEY SAY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
ACQUITTALS EARLIER THE PAINTER ANSWERED BUT IT'S VERY HARD TO BE
SURE ABOUT IT
THE COURTS DON'T MAKE THEIR FINAL CONCLUSIONS PUBLIC
NOT EVEN THE JUDGES ARE ALLOWED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM SO THAT ALL WE KNOW
ABOUT THESE EARLIER CASES ARE JUST LEGENDS
BUT MOST OF THEM DID
INVOLVE ABSOLUTE ACQUITTALS YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT BUT THEY CAN'T BE
PROVED
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU SHOULDN'T FORGET ALL ABOUT THEM EITHER
I'M SURE THERE IS SOME TRUTH TO THEM AND THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL I'VE
PAINTED A FEW PICTURES MYSELF DEPICTING THESE LEGENDS MY ASSESSMENT
WILL NOT BE ALTERED BY MERE LEGENDS SAID K
I DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S
POSSIBLE TO CITE THESE LEGENDS IN COURT IS IT THE PAINTER LAUGHED
NO YOU CAN'T CITE THEM IN COURT HE SAID
THEN THERE'S NO POINT IN
TALKING ABOUT THEM SAID K HE WANTED FOR THE TIME BEING TO ACCEPT
ANYTHING THE PAINTER TOLD HIM EVEN IF HE THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY OR
CONTRADICTED WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD BY OTHERS
HE DID NOT NOW HAVE THE
TIME TO EXAMINE THE TRUTH OF EVERYTHING THE PAINTER SAID OR EVEN TO
DISPROVE IT HE WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED AS MUCH AS HE COULD IF THE PAINTER
WOULD HELP HIM IN ANY WAY EVEN IF HIS HELP WOULD NOT BE DECISIVE
AS A
RESULT HE SAID SO LET'S PAY NO MORE ATTENTION TO ABSOLUTE ACQUITTAL
BUT YOU MENTIONED TWO OTHER POSSIBILITIES APPARENT ACQUITTAL AND
DEFERMENT
THEY'RE THE ONLY POSSIBILITIES SAID THE PAINTER
BUT
BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THEM WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO TAKE YOUR COAT OFF
YOU MUST BE HOT YES SAID K WHO UNTIL THEN HAD PAID ATTENTION TO
NOTHING BUT THE PAINTER'S EXPLANATIONS BUT NOW THAT HE HAD HAD THE HEAT
POINTED OUT TO HIM HIS BROW BEGAN TO SWEAT HEAVILY
IT'S ALMOST
UNBEARABLE THE PAINTER NODDED AS IF HE UNDERSTOOD K 'S DISCOMFORT
VERY WELL
COULD WE NOT OPEN THE WINDOW ASKED K
NO SAID THE
PAINTER
IT'S ONLY A FIXED PANE OF GLASS IT CAN'T BE OPENED K
NOW
REALISED THAT ALL THIS TIME HE HAD BEEN HOPING THE PAINTER WOULD
SUDDENLY GO OVER TO THE WINDOW AND PULL IT OPEN
HE HAD PREPARED
HIMSELF EVEN FOR THE FOG THAT HE WOULD BREATHE IN THROUGH HIS OPEN
MOUTH
THE THOUGHT THAT HERE HE WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF FROM THE AIR MADE
HIM FEEL DIZZY
HE TAPPED LIGHTLY ON THE BEDSPREAD BESIDE HIM AND WITH
A WEAK VOICE SAID THAT IS VERY INCONVENIENT AND UNHEALTHY OH NO
SAID THE PAINTER IN DEFENCE OF HIS WINDOW AS IT CAN'T BE OPENED THIS
ROOM RETAINS THE HEAT BETTER THAN IF THE WINDOW WERE DOUBLE GLAZED EVEN
THOUGH IT'S ONLY A SINGLE PANE
THERE'S NOT MUCH NEED TO AIR THE ROOM
AS THERE'S SO MUCH VENTILATION THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE WOOD BUT WHEN I
DO WANT TO I CAN OPEN ONE OF MY DOORS OR EVEN BOTH OF THEM K
WAS
SLIGHTLY CONSOLED BY THIS EXPLANATION AND LOOKED AROUND TO SEE WHERE THE
SECOND DOOR WAS
THE PAINTER SAW HIM DO SO AND SAID IT'S BEHIND YOU
I HAD TO HIDE IT BEHIND THE BED ONLY THEN WAS K
ABLE TO SEE THE
LITTLE DOOR IN THE WALL
IT'S REALLY MUCH TOO SMALL FOR A STUDIO
HERE SAID THE PAINTER AS IF HE WANTED TO ANTICIPATE AN OBJECTION K
WOULD MAKE
I HAD TO ARRANGE THINGS AS WELL AS I COULD
THAT'S
OBVIOUSLY A VERY BAD PLACE FOR THE BED IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
FOR
INSTANCE WHEN THE JUDGE I'M PAINTING AT PRESENT COMES HE ALWAYS COMES
THROUGH THE DOOR BY THE BED AND I'VE EVEN GIVEN HIM A KEY TO THIS DOOR
SO THAT HE CAN WAIT FOR ME HERE IN THE STUDIO WHEN I'M NOT HOME
ALTHOUGH NOWADAYS HE USUALLY COMES EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN I'M STILL
ASLEEP
AND OF COURSE IT ALWAYS WAKES ME UP WHEN I HEAR THE DOOR
OPENED BESIDE THE BED HOWEVER FAST ASLEEP I AM
IF YOU COULD HEAR THE
WAY I CURSE HIM AS HE CLIMBS OVER MY BED IN THE MORNING YOU'D LOSE ALL
RESPECT FOR JUDGES
I SUPPOSE I COULD TAKE THE KEY AWAY FROM HIM BUT
THAT'D ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE
IT ONLY TAKES A TINY EFFORT TO BREAK ANY
OF THE DOORS HERE OFF THEIR HINGES ALL THE TIME THE PAINTER WAS
SPEAKING K
WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER HE SHOULD TAKE OFF HIS COAT BUT HE
FINALLY REALISED THAT IF HE DIDN'T DO SO HE WOULD BE QUITE UNABLE TO
STAY HERE ANY LONGER SO HE TOOK OFF HIS FROCK COAT AND LAY IT ON HIS
KNEE SO THAT HE COULD PUT IT BACK ON AGAIN AS SOON AS THE CONVERSATION
WAS OVER
HE HAD HARDLY DONE THIS WHEN ONE OF THE GIRLS CALLED OUT
NOW HE'S TAKEN HIS COAT OFF AND THEY COULD ALL BE HEARD PRESSING
AROUND THE GAPS IN THE PLANKS TO SEE THE SPECTACLE FOR THEMSELVES
THE
GIRLS THINK I'M GOING TO PAINT YOUR PORTRAIT SAID THE PAINTER AND
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE TAKING YOUR COAT OFF I SEE SAID K ONLY
SLIGHTLY AMUSED BY THIS AS HE FELT LITTLE BETTER THAN HE HAD BEFORE
EVEN THOUGH HE NOW SAT IN HIS SHIRTSLEEVES
WITH SOME IRRITATION HE
ASKED WHAT DID YOU SAY THE TWO OTHER POSSIBILITIES WERE HE HAD
ALREADY FORGOTTEN THE TERMS USED
APPARENT ACQUITTAL AND DEFERMENT
SAID THE PAINTER
IT'S UP TO YOU WHICH ONE YOU CHOOSE
YOU CAN GET
EITHER OF THEM IF I HELP YOU BUT IT'LL TAKE SOME EFFORT OF COURSE THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS THAT APPARENT ACQUITTAL NEEDS CONCENTRATED
EFFORT FOR A WHILE AND THAT DEFERMENT TAKES MUCH LESS EFFORT BUT IT HAS
TO BE SUSTAINED
NOW THEN APPARENT ACQUITTAL
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
I'LL WRITE DOWN AN ASSERTION OF YOUR INNOCENCE ON A PIECE OF PAPER
THE
TEXT FOR AN ASSERTION OF THIS SORT WAS PASSED DOWN TO ME FROM MY FATHER
AND IT'S QUITE UNASSAILABLE
I TAKE THIS ASSERTION ROUND TO THE JUDGES
I KNOW
SO I'LL START OFF WITH THE ONE I'M CURRENTLY PAINTING AND PUT
THE ASSERTION TO HIM WHEN HE COMES FOR HIS SITTING THIS EVENING
I'LL
LAY THE ASSERTION IN FRONT OF HIM EXPLAIN THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT AND GIVE
HIM MY PERSONAL GUARANTEE OF IT
AND THAT'S NOT JUST A SUPERFICIAL
GUARANTEE IT'S A REAL ONE AND IT'S BINDING THE PAINTER'S EYES SEEMED
TO SHOW SOME REPROACH OF K
FOR WANTING TO IMPOSE THAT SORT OF
RESPONSIBILITY ON HIM
THAT WOULD BE VERY KIND OF YOU SAID K
AND
WOULD THE JUDGE THEN BELIEVE YOU AND NONETHELESS NOT PASS AN ABSOLUTE
ACQUITTAL IT'S LIKE I JUST SAID ANSWERED THE PAINTER
AND
ANYWAY IT'S NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT ALL THE JUDGES WOULD BELIEVE ME
MANY OF THEM FOR INSTANCE MIGHT WANT ME TO BRING YOU TO SEE THEM
PERSONALLY
SO THEN YOU'D HAVE TO COME ALONG TOO
BUT AT LEAST THEN
IF THAT HAPPENS THE MATTER IS HALF WAY WON ESPECIALLY AS I'D TEACH YOU
IN ADVANCE EXACTLY HOW YOU'D NEED TO ACT WITH THE JUDGE CONCERNED OF
COURSE
WHAT ALSO HAPPENS THOUGH IS THAT THERE ARE SOME JUDGES WHO'LL
TURN ME DOWN IN ADVANCE AND THAT'S WORSE
I'LL CERTAINLY MAKE SEVERAL
ATTEMPTS BUT STILL WE'LL HAVE TO FORGET ABOUT THEM BUT AT LEAST WE
CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT AS NO ONE JUDGE CAN PASS THE DECISIVE VERDICT
THEN WHEN I'VE GOT ENOUGH JUDGES' SIGNATURES ON THIS DOCUMENT I TAKE IT
TO THE JUDGE WHO'S CONCERNED WITH YOUR CASE
I MIGHT EVEN HAVE HIS
SIGNATURE ALREADY IN WHICH CASE THINGS DEVELOP A BIT QUICKER THAN THEY
WOULD DO OTHERWISE
BUT THERE AREN'T USUALLY MANY HOLD UPS FROM THEN
ON AND THAT'S THE TIME THAT THE DEFENDANT CAN FEEL MOST CONFIDENT
IT'S ODD BUT TRUE THAT PEOPLE FEEL MORE CONFIDENCE IN THIS TIME THAN
THEY DO AFTER THEY'VE BEEN ACQUITTED
THERE'S NO PARTICULAR EXERTION
NEEDED NOW
WHEN HE HAS THE DOCUMENT ASSERTING THE DEFENDANT'S
INNOCENCE GUARANTEED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER JUDGES THE JUDGE CAN ACQUIT
YOU WITHOUT ANY WORRIES AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL
FORMALITIES TO BE GONE THROUGH THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT'S WHAT HE'LL
DO AS A FAVOUR TO ME AND SEVERAL OTHER ACQUAINTANCES
YOU HOWEVER
WALK OUT THE COURT AND YOU'RE FREE SO THEN I'LL BE FREE SAID K
HESITANTLY
THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE PAINTER BUT ONLY APPARENTLY FREE
OR TO PUT IT A BETTER WAY TEMPORARILY FREE AS THE MOST JUNIOR JUDGES
THE ONES I KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO GIVE THE FINAL ACQUITTAL
ONLY THE HIGHEST JUDGE CAN DO THAT IN THE COURT THAT'S QUITE OUT OF REACH
FOR YOU FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF US
WE DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS LOOK THERE
AND INCIDENTALLY WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW
THE RIGHT TO ACQUIT PEOPLE
IS A MAJOR PRIVILEGE AND OUR JUDGES DON'T HAVE IT BUT THEY DO HAVE THE
RIGHT TO FREE PEOPLE FROM THE INDICTMENT
THAT'S TO SAY IF THEY'RE
FREED IN THIS WAY THEN FOR THE TIME BEING THE CHARGE IS WITHDRAWN BUT
IT'S STILL HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS AND IT ONLY TAKES AN ORDER FROM
HIGHER UP TO BRING IT BACK INTO FORCE
AND AS I'M IN SUCH GOOD CONTACT
WITH THE COURT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU HOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABSOLUTE
AND APPARENT ACQUITTAL IS DESCRIBED JUST IN A SUPERFICIAL WAY IN THE
DIRECTIVES TO THE COURT OFFICES
IF THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE ACQUITTAL ALL
PROCEEDINGS SHOULD STOP EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS FROM THE PROCESS NOT
JUST THE INDICTMENT BUT THE TRIAL AND EVEN THE ACQUITTAL DISAPPEARS
EVERYTHING JUST DISAPPEARS
WITH AN APPARENT ACQUITTAL IT'S DIFFERENT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS NOTHING HAS CHANGED EXCEPT THAT THE CASE FOR YOUR
INNOCENCE FOR YOUR ACQUITTAL AND THE GROUNDS FOR THE ACQUITTAL HAVE
BEEN MADE STRONGER
APART FROM THAT PROCEEDINGS GO ON AS BEFORE THE
COURT OFFICES CONTINUE THEIR BUSINESS AND THE CASE GETS PASSED TO HIGHER
COURTS GETS PASSED BACK DOWN TO THE LOWER COURTS AND SO ON BACKWARDS
AND FORWARDS SOMETIMES FASTER SOMETIMES SLOWER TO AND FRO
IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING WHILE THIS IS GOING ON
SEEN FROM OUTSIDE IT CAN SOMETIMES SEEM THAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LONG
SINCE FORGOTTEN THE DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN LOST AND THE ACQUITTAL IS
COMPLETE
NO ONE FAMILIAR WITH THE COURT WOULD BELIEVE IT
NO
DOCUMENTS EVER GET LOST THE COURT FORGETS NOTHING
ONE DAY NO ONE
EXPECTS IT SOME JUDGE OR OTHER PICKS UP THE DOCUMENTS AND LOOKS MORE
CLOSELY AT THEM HE NOTICES THAT THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS STILL ACTIVE
AND ORDERS THE DEFENDANT'S IMMEDIATE ARREST
I'VE BEEN TALKING HERE AS
IF THERE'S A LONG DELAY BETWEEN APPARENT ACQUITTAL AND RE ARREST THAT
IS QUITE POSSIBLE AND I DO KNOW OF CASES LIKE THAT BUT IT'S JUST AS
LIKELY THAT THE DEFENDANT GOES HOME AFTER HE'S BEEN ACQUITTED AND FINDS
SOMEBODY THERE WAITING TO RE ARREST HIM
THEN OF COURSE HIS LIFE AS A
FREE MAN IS AT AN END AND DOES THE TRIAL START OVER AGAIN ASKED
K FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE
THE TRIAL WILL ALWAYS START OVER
AGAIN SAID THE PAINTER BUT THERE IS ONCE AGAIN AS BEFORE THE
POSSIBILITY OF GETTING AN APPARENT ACQUITTAL
ONCE AGAIN THE ACCUSED
HAS TO MUSTER ALL HIS STRENGTH AND MUSTN'T GIVE UP THE PAINTER SAID
THAT LAST PHRASE POSSIBLY AS A RESULT OF THE IMPRESSION THAT K WHOSE
SHOULDERS HAD DROPPED SOMEWHAT GAVE ON HIM
BUT TO GET A SECOND
ACQUITTAL ASKED K AS IF IN ANTICIPATION OF FURTHER REVELATIONS BY
THE PAINTER IS THAT NOT HARDER TO GET THAN THE FIRST TIME AS FAR
AS THAT'S CONCERNED ANSWERED THE PAINTER THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
FOR CERTAIN
YOU MEAN DO YOU THAT THE SECOND ARREST WOULD HAVE AN
ADVERSE INFLUENCE ON THE JUDGE AND THE VERDICT HE PASSES ON THE
DEFENDANT THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENS
WHEN THE ACQUITTAL IS PASSED THE
JUDGES ARE ALREADY AWARE THAT RE ARREST IS LIKELY
SO WHEN IT HAPPENS
IT HAS HARDLY ANY EFFECT
BUT THERE ARE COUNTLESS OTHER REASONS WHY THE
JUDGES' MOOD AND THEIR LEGAL ACUMEN IN THE CASE CAN BE ALTERED AND
EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THE SECOND ACQUITTAL MUST THEREFORE BE SUITED TO THE
NEW CONDITIONS AND GENERALLY JUST AS VIGOROUS AS THE FIRST BUT THIS
SECOND ACQUITTAL WILL ONCE AGAIN NOT BE FINAL SAID K SHAKING HIS
HEAD
OF COURSE NOT SAID THE PAINTER THE SECOND ACQUITTAL IS
FOLLOWED BY THE THIRD ARREST THE THIRD ACQUITTAL BY THE FOURTH ARREST
AND SO ON
THAT'S WHAT IS MEANT BY THE TERM APPARENT ACQUITTAL K
WAS SILENT
YOU CLEARLY DON'T THINK AN APPARENT ACQUITTAL OFFERS MUCH
ADVANTAGE SAID THE PAINTER PERHAPS DEFERMENT WOULD SUIT YOU BETTER
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT DEFERMENT IS ABOUT K
NODDED
THE
PAINTER HAD LEANT BACK AND SPREAD HIMSELF OUT IN HIS CHAIR HIS
NIGHTSHIRT WAS WIDE OPEN HE HAD PUSHED HIS HAND INSIDE AND WAS STROKING
HIS BREAST AND HIS SIDES
DEFERMENT SAID THE PAINTER LOOKING
VAGUELY IN FRONT OF HIMSELF FOR A WHILE AS IF TRYING TO FIND A PERFECTLY
APPROPRIATE EXPLANATION DEFERMENT CONSISTS OF KEEPING PROCEEDINGS
PERMANENTLY IN THEIR EARLIEST STAGES
TO DO THAT THE ACCUSED AND THOSE
HELPING HIM NEED TO KEEP IN CONTINUOUS PERSONAL CONTACT WITH THE COURT
ESPECIALLY THOSE HELPING HIM
I REPEAT THIS DOESN'T REQUIRE SO MUCH
EFFORT AS GETTING AN APPARENT ACQUITTAL BUT IT PROBABLY REQUIRES A LOT
MORE ATTENTION
YOU MUST NEVER LET THE TRIAL OUT OF YOUR SIGHT YOU
HAVE TO GO AND SEE THE APPROPRIATE JUDGE AT REGULAR INTERVALS AS WELL AS
WHEN SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR COMES UP AND WHATEVER YOU DO YOU HAVE TO
TRY AND REMAIN FRIENDLY WITH HIM IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE JUDGE PERSONALLY
YOU HAVE TO INFLUENCE HIM THROUGH THE JUDGES YOU DO KNOW AND YOU HAVE
TO DO IT WITHOUT GIVING UP ON THE DIRECT DISCUSSIONS
AS LONG AS YOU
DON'T FAIL TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS YOU CAN BE REASONABLY SURE THE
TRIAL WON'T GET PAST ITS FIRST STAGES
THE TRIAL DOESN'T STOP BUT THE
DEFENDANT IS ALMOST AS CERTAIN OF AVOIDING CONVICTION AS IF HE'D BEEN
ACQUITTED
COMPARED WITH AN APPARENT ACQUITTAL DEFERMENT HAS THE
ADVANTAGE THAT THE DEFENDANT'S FUTURE IS LESS UNCERTAIN HE'S SAFE FROM
THE SHOCK OF BEING SUDDENLY RE ARRESTED AND DOESN'T NEED TO FEAR THE
EXERTIONS AND STRESS INVOLVED IN GETTING AN APPARENT ACQUITTAL JUST WHEN
EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS LIFE WOULD MAKE IT MOST DIFFICULT
DEFERMENT
DOES HAVE CERTAIN DISADVANTAGES OF ITS OWN THOUGH TOO AND THEY
SHOULDN'T BE UNDER ESTIMATED
I DON'T MEAN BY THIS THAT THE DEFENDANT
IS NEVER FREE HE'S NEVER FREE IN THE PROPER SENSE OF THE WORD WITH AN
APPARENT ACQUITTAL EITHER
THERE'S ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE
PROCEEDINGS
CAN'T BE PREVENTED FROM MOVING FORWARD UNLESS THERE ARE SOME AT LEAST
OSTENSIBLE REASONS GIVEN
SO SOMETHING NEEDS TO SEEM TO BE HAPPENING
WHEN LOOKED AT FROM THE OUTSIDE
THIS MEANS THAT FROM TIME TO TIME
VARIOUS INJUNCTIONS HAVE TO BE OBEYED THE ACCUSED HAS TO BE QUESTIONED
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE TO TAKE PLACE AND SO ON
THE TRIAL'S BEEN
ARTIFICIALLY CONSTRAINED INSIDE A TINY CIRCLE AND IT HAS TO BE
CONTINUOUSLY SPUN ROUND WITHIN IT
AND THAT OF COURSE BRINGS WITH IT
CERTAIN UNPLEASANTNESSES FOR THE ACCUSED ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULDN'T IMAGINE
THEY'RE ALL THAT BAD
ALL OF THIS IS JUST FOR SHOW THE INTERROGATIONS
FOR INSTANCE THEY'RE ONLY VERY SHORT IF YOU EVER DON'T HAVE THE TIME
OR DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING TO THEM YOU CAN OFFER AN EXCUSE WITH SOME
JUDGES YOU CAN EVEN ARRANGE THE INJUNCTIONS TOGETHER A LONG TIME IN
ADVANCE IN ESSENCE ALL IT MEANS IS THAT AS THE ACCUSED YOU HAVE TO
REPORT TO THE JUDGE FROM TIME TO TIME EVEN WHILE THE PAINTER WAS
SPEAKING THOSE LAST WORDS K
HAD LAID HIS COAT OVER HIS ARM AND HAD
STOOD UP
IMMEDIATELY FROM OUTSIDE THE DOOR THERE WAS A CRY OF 'HE'S
STANDING UP NOW ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY ASKED THE PAINTER WHO
HAD ALSO STOOD UP
IT MUST BE THE AIR THAT'S DRIVING YOU OUT
I'M
VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT
THERE'S STILL A LOT I NEED TO TELL YOU
I HAD
TO PUT EVERYTHING VERY BRIEFLY BUT I HOPE AT LEAST IT WAS ALL CLEAR
OH YES SAID K WHOSE HEAD WAS ACHING FROM THE EFFORT OF LISTENING
DESPITE THIS AFFIRMATION THE PAINTER SUMMED IT ALL UP ONCE MORE AS IF
HE WANTED TO GIVE K
SOMETHING TO CONSOLE HIM ON HIS WAY HOME
BOTH
HAVE IN COMMON THAT THEY PREVENT THE DEFENDANT BEING CONVICTED HE
SAID
BUT THEY ALSO PREVENT HIS BEING PROPERLY ACQUITTED SAID K
QUIETLY AS IF ASHAMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT
YOU'VE GOT IT IN ESSENCE
SAID THE PAINTER QUICKLY
K
PLACED HIS HAND ON HIS WINTER OVERCOAT BUT
COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO PUT IT ON
MOST OF ALL HE WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO PACK EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND RUN OUT TO THE FRESH AIR
NOT EVEN THE
GIRLS COULD INDUCE HIM TO PUT HIS COAT ON EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ALREADY
LOUDLY TELLING EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS DOING SO
THE PAINTER STILL HAD
TO INTERPRET K 'S MOOD IN SOME WAY SO HE SAID I EXPECT YOU'VE
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED DECIDING BETWEEN MY SUGGESTIONS YET
THAT'S GOOD
I WOULD EVEN HAVE ADVISED AGAINST MAKING A DECISION STRAIGHT AWAY
THERE'S NO MORE THAN A HAIR'S BREADTH OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE CAREFULLY WEIGHED
UP
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU SHOULDN'T LOSE TOO MUCH TIME
I'LL COME BACK HERE AGAIN SOON SAID K WHO HAD SUDDENLY DECIDED TO
PUT HIS FROCK COAT ON THREW HIS OVERCOAT OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HURRIED
OVER TO THE DOOR BEHIND WHICH THE GIRLS NOW BEGAN TO SCREAM
K
THOUGHT
HE COULD EVEN SEE THE SCREAMING GIRLS THROUGH THE DOOR
WELL YOU'LL
HAVE TO KEEP YOUR WORD SAID THE PAINTER WHO HAD NOT FOLLOWED HIM
OTHERWISE I'LL COME TO THE BANK TO ASK ABOUT IT MYSELF WILL YOU OPEN
THIS DOOR FOR ME SAID K
PULLING AT THE HANDLE WHICH AS HE NOTICED
FROM THE RESISTANCE WAS BEING HELD TIGHTLY BY THE GIRLS ON THE OTHER
SIDE
DO YOU WANT TO BE BOTHERED BY THE GIRLS ASKED THE PAINTER
IT'S BETTER IF YOU USE THE OTHER WAY OUT HE SAID POINTING TO THE
DOOR BEHIND THE BED
K
AGREED TO THIS AND JUMPED BACK TO THE BED
BUT
INSTEAD OF OPENING THAT DOOR THE PAINTER CRAWLED UNDER THE BED AND FROM
UNDERNEATH IT ASKED K JUST A MOMENT MORE WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO SEE A
PICTURE I COULD SELL TO YOU K
DID NOT WANT TO BE IMPOLITE THE
PAINTER REALLY HAD TAKEN HIS SIDE AND PROMISED TO HELP HIM MORE IN THE
FUTURE AND BECAUSE OF K 'S FORGETFULNESS THERE HAD BEEN NO MENTION OF
ANY PAYMENT FOR THE PAINTER'S HELP SO K
COULD NOT TURN HIM DOWN NOW
AND ALLOWED HIM TO SHOW HIM THE PICTURE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS QUIVERING
WITH IMPATIENCE TO GET OUT OF THE STUDIO
FROM UNDER THE BED THE
PAINTER WITHDREW A PILE OF UNFRAMED PAINTINGS
THEY WERE SO COVERED IN
DUST THAT WHEN THE PAINTER TRIED TO BLOW IT OFF THE ONE ON TOP THE DUST
SWIRLED AROUND IN FRONT OF K 'S EYES ROBBING HIM OF BREATH FOR SOME
TIME
MOORLAND LANDSCAPE SAID THE PAINTER PASSING THE PICTURE TO K
IT SHOWED TWO SICKLY TREES WELL SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER IN DARK
GRASS
IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WAS A MULTI COLOURED SUNSET
THAT'S
NICE SAID K
I'LL BUY IT K
EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN THIS CURT WAY
WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT SO HE WAS GLAD WHEN THE PAINTER DID NOT TAKE THIS
AMISS AND PICKED UP A SECOND PAINTING FROM THE FLOOR
THIS IS A
COUNTERPART TO THE FIRST PICTURE SAID THE PAINTER
PERHAPS IT HAD
BEEN INTENDED AS A COUNTERPART BUT THERE WAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST
DIFFERENCE TO BE SEEN BETWEEN IT AND THE FIRST PICTURE THERE WERE THE
TREES THERE THE GRASS AND THERE THE SUNSET
BUT THIS WAS OF LITTLE
IMPORTANCE TO K
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES HE SAID I'LL BUY
THEM BOTH AND HANG THEM IN MY OFFICE YOU SEEM TO LIKE THIS SUBJECT
SAID THE PAINTER PICKING UP A THIRD PAINTING GOOD JOB I'VE STILL GOT
ANOTHER SIMILAR PICTURE HERE THE PICTURE THOUGH WAS NOT SIMILAR
RATHER IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME MOORLAND LANDSCAPE
THE PAINTER WAS
FULLY EXPLOITING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SELL OFF HIS OLD PICTURES
I'LL
TAKE THIS ONE TOO SAID K
HOW MUCH DO THE THREE PAINTINGS COST
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME SAID THE PAINTER
YOU'RE IN A
HURRY NOW AND WE'LL STILL BE IN CONTACT
AND BESIDES I'M GLAD YOU
LIKE THE PAINTINGS I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE PAINTINGS I'VE GOT DOWN HERE
THEY'RE ALL MOORLAND LANDSCAPES I'VE PAINTED A LOT OF MOORLAND
LANDSCAPES
A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT SORT OF PICTURE BECAUSE
THEY'RE TOO GLOOMY BUT THERE ARE OTHERS AND YOU'RE ONE OF THEM WHO
LOVE GLOOMY THEMES BUT K
WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO HEAR ABOUT THE
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES OF THIS PAINTER CUM BEGGAR
WRAP THEM ALL
UP HE CALLED OUT INTERRUPTING THE PAINTER AS HE WAS SPEAKING MY
SERVANT WILL COME TO FETCH THEM IN THE MORNING THERE'S NO NEED FOR
THAT SAID THE PAINTER
I EXPECT I CAN FIND A PORTER FOR YOU WHO CAN
GO WITH YOU NOW AND AT LAST HE LEANT OVER THE BED AND UNLOCKED THE
DOOR
JUST STEP ON THE BED DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT SAID THE PAINTER
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE DOES WHO COMES IN HERE EVEN WITHOUT THIS
INVITATION K
HAD SHOWN NO COMPUNCTION IN ALREADY PLACING HIS FOOT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE BED COVERS THEN HE LOOKED OUT THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR
AND DREW HIS FOOT BACK AGAIN
WHAT IS THAT HE ASKED THE PAINTER
WHAT ARE YOU SO SURPRISED AT HE ASKED SURPRISED IN HIS TURN
THOSE
ARE COURT OFFICES
DIDN'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE COURT OFFICES HERE THERE
ARE COURT OFFICES IN ALMOST EVERY ATTIC WHY SHOULD THIS BUILDING BE ANY
DIFFERENT EVEN MY STUDIO IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE COURT OFFICES BUT THE
COURT PUT IT AT MY DISPOSAL IT WAS NOT SO MUCH FINDING COURT OFFICES
EVEN HERE THAT SHOCKED K HE WAS MAINLY SHOCKED AT HIMSELF AT HIS OWN
NAVETY IN COURT MATTERS
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT ONE OF THE MOST BASIC
RULES GOVERNING HOW A DEFENDANT SHOULD BEHAVE WAS ALWAYS TO BE PREPARED
NEVER ALLOW SURPRISES NEVER TO LOOK UNSUSPECTING TO THE RIGHT WHEN
THE JUDGE STOOD BESIDE HIM TO HIS LEFT AND THIS WAS THE VERY BASIC
RULE THAT HE WAS CONTINUALLY VIOLATING
A LONG CORRIDOR EXTENDED IN
FROM OF HIM AIR BLEW IN FROM IT WHICH COMPARED WITH THE AIR IN THE
STUDIO WAS REFRESHING
THERE WERE BENCHES SET ALONG EACH SIDE OF THE
CORRIDOR JUST AS IN THE WAITING AREA FOR THE OFFICE HE WENT TO HIMSELF
THERE SEEMED TO BE PRECISE RULES GOVERNING HOW OFFICES SHOULD BE
EQUIPPED
THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE MANY PEOPLE VISITING THE OFFICES
THAT DAY
THERE WAS A MAN THERE HALF SITTING HALF LAYING HIS FACE
WAS BURIED IN HIS ARM ON THE BENCH AND HE SEEMED TO BE SLEEPING ANOTHER
MAN WAS STANDING IN THE HALF DARK AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
K
NOW
CLIMBED OVER THE BED THE PAINTER FOLLOWED HIM WITH THE PICTURES
THEY
SOON CAME ACROSS A SERVANT OF THE COURT K
WAS NOW ABLE TO RECOGNISE
ALL THE SERVANTS OF THE COURT FROM THE GOLD BUTTONS THEY WORE ON THEIR
CIVILIAN CLOTHES BELOW THE NORMAL BUTTONS AND THE PAINTER INSTRUCTED
HIM TO GO WITH K
CARRYING THE PICTURES
K
STAGGERED MORE THAN HE
WALKED HIS HANDKERCHIEF PRESSED OVER HIS MOUTH
THEY HAD NEARLY
REACHED THE EXIT WHEN THE GIRLS STORMED IN ON THEM SO K
HAD NOT BEEN
ABLE TO AVOID THEM
THEY HAD CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE SECOND DOOR OF THE
STUDIO HAD BEEN OPENED AND HAD GONE AROUND TO IMPOSE THEMSELVES ON HIM
FROM THIS SIDE
I CAN'T COME WITH YOU ANY FURTHER CALLED OUT THE
PAINTER WITH A LAUGH AS THE GIRLS PRESSED IN
GOODBYE AND DON'T
HESITATE TOO LONG K
DID NOT EVEN LOOK ROUND AT HIM
ONCE ON THE
STREET HE TOOK THE FIRST CAB HE CAME ACROSS
HE NOW HAD TO GET RID OF
THE SERVANT WHOSE GOLD BUTTON CONTINUALLY CAUGHT HIS EYE EVEN IF IT
CAUGHT NO ONE ELSE'S
AS A SERVANT THE SERVANT OF THE COURT WAS GOING
TO SIT ON THE COACH BOX
BUT K
CHASED HIM DOWN FROM THERE
IT WAS
ALREADY WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON WHEN K
ARRIVED IN FRONT OF THE BANK
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO LEAVE THE PICTURES IN THE CAB BUT FEARED THERE
MIGHT BE SOME OCCASION WHEN HE WOULD HAVE TO LET THE PAINTER SEE HE
STILL HAD THEM
SO HE HAD THE PICTURES TAKEN TO HIS OFFICE AND LOCKED
THEM IN THE LOWEST DRAWER OF HIS DESK SO THAT HE COULD AT LEAST KEEP
THEM SAFE FROM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR'S VIEW FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS
CHAPTER EIGHT
BLOCK THE BUSINESSMAN DISMISSING THE LAWYER
K
HAD AT LAST MADE THE DECISION TO WITHDRAW HIS DEFENCE FROM THE
LAWYER
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE HIS DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER THIS WAS
THE RIGHT DECISION BUT THIS WAS OUTWEIGHED BY HIS BELIEF IN ITS
NECESSITY
THIS DECISION ON THE DAY HE INTENDED TO GO TO SEE THE
LAWYER TOOK A LOT OF THE STRENGTH HE NEEDED FOR HIS WORK HE WORKED
EXCEPTIONALLY SLOWLY HE HAD TO REMAIN IN HIS OFFICE A LONG TIME AND IT
WAS ALREADY PAST TEN O'CLOCK WHEN HE FINALLY STOOD IN FRONT OF THE
LAWYER'S FRONT DOOR
EVEN BEFORE HE RANG HE CONSIDERED WHETHER IT MIGHT
NOT BE BETTER TO GIVE THE LAWYER NOTICE BY LETTER OR TELEPHONE A
PERSONAL CONVERSATION WOULD CERTAINLY BE VERY DIFFICULT
NONETHELESS
K
DID NOT ACTUALLY WANT TO DO WITHOUT IT IF HE GAVE NOTICE BY ANY
OTHER MEANS IT WOULD BE RECEIVED IN SILENCE OR WITH A FEW FORMULATED
WORDS AND UNLESS LENI COULD DISCOVER ANYTHING K
WOULD NEVER LEARN HOW
THE LAWYER HAD TAKEN HIS DISMISSAL AND WHAT ITS CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE
IN THE LAWYER'S NOT UNIMPORTANT OPINION
BUT SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM
AND TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY HIS DISMISSAL K
WOULD BE ABLE EASILY TO INFER
EVERYTHING HE WANTED FROM THE LAWYER'S FACE AND BEHAVIOUR EVEN IF HE
COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO SAY VERY MUCH
IT WAS NOT EVEN OUT OF THE
QUESTION THAT K
MIGHT AFTER ALL BE PERSUADED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO
LEAVE HIS DEFENCE TO THE LAWYER AND WITHDRAW HIS DISMISSAL
AS USUAL THERE WAS AT FIRST NO RESPONSE TO K 'S RING AT THE DOOR
LENI COULD BE A BIT QUICKER THOUGHT K
BUT HE COULD AT LEAST BE GLAD
THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE INTERFERING AS USUALLY HAPPENED BE IT THE MAN IN
HIS NIGHTSHIRT OR ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT BOTHER HIM
AS K
PRESSED ON
THE BUTTON FOR THE SECOND TIME HE LOOKED BACK AT THE OTHER DOOR BUT
THIS TIME IT TOO REMAINED CLOSED
AT LAST TWO EYES APPEARED AT THE
SPY HATCH IN THE LAWYER'S DOOR ALTHOUGH THEY WEREN'T LENI'S EYES
SOMEONE UNLOCKED THE DOOR BUT KEPT HIMSELF PRESSED AGAINST IT AS HE
CALLED BACK INSIDE IT'S HIM AND ONLY THEN DID HE OPEN THE DOOR
PROPERLY
K
PUSHED AGAINST THE DOOR AS BEHIND HIM HE COULD ALREADY
HEAR THE KEY BEING HURRIEDLY TURNED IN THE LOCK OF THE DOOR TO THE OTHER
FLAT
WHEN THE DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM FINALLY OPENED HE STORMED STRAIGHT
INTO THE HALLWAY
THROUGH THE CORRIDOR WHICH LED BETWEEN THE ROOMS HE
SAW LENI TO WHOM THE WARNING CRY OF THE DOOR OPENER HAD BEEN DIRECTED
STILL RUNNING AWAY IN HER NIGHTSHIRT
HE LOOKED AT HER FOR A MOMENT
AND THEN LOOKED ROUND AT THE PERSON WHO HAD OPENED THE DOOR
IT WAS A
SMALL WIZENED MAN WITH A FULL BEARD HE HELD A CANDLE IN HIS HAND
DO
YOU WORK HERE ASKED K
NO ANSWERED THE MAN I DON'T BELONG HERE
AT ALL THE LAWYER IS ONLY REPRESENTING ME I'M HERE ON LEGAL BUSINESS
WITHOUT YOUR COAT ASKED K INDICATING THE MAN'S DEFICIENCY OF DRESS
WITH A GESTURE OF HIS HAND
OH DO FORGIVE ME SAID THE MAN AND HE
LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE HE WAS HOLDING AS IF HE HAD
NOT KNOWN ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE UNTIL THEN
IS LENI YOUR LOVER ASKED K
CURTLY
HE HAD SET HIS LEGS SLIGHTLY
APART HIS HANDS IN WHICH HE HELD HIS HAT WERE BEHIND HIS BACK
MERELY BY BEING IN POSSESSION OF A THICK OVERCOAT HE FELT HIS ADVANTAGE
OVER THIS THIN LITTLE MAN
OH GOD HE SAID AND SHOCKED RAISED ONE
HAND IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AS IF IN DEFENCE NO NO WHAT CAN YOU BE
THINKING YOU LOOK HONEST ENOUGH SAID K
WITH A SMILE BUT COME
ALONG ANYWAY K
INDICATED WITH HIS HAT WHICH WAY THE MAN WAS TO GO
AND LET HIM GO AHEAD OF HIM
WHAT IS YOUR NAME THEN ASKED K
ON THE
WAY
BLOCK
I'M A BUSINESSMAN SAID THE SMALL MAN TWISTING HIMSELF
ROUND AS HE THUS INTRODUCED HIMSELF ALTHOUGH K
DID NOT ALLOW HIM TO
STOP MOVING
IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME ASKED K
OF COURSE IT IS WAS
THE MAN'S REPLY WHY DO YOU DOUBT IT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME
REASON TO KEEP YOUR NAME SECRET SAID K
HE FELT HIMSELF AS MUCH AT
LIBERTY AS IS NORMALLY ONLY FELT IN FOREIGN PARTS WHEN SPEAKING WITH
PEOPLE OF LOWER STANDING KEEPING EVERYTHING ABOUT HIMSELF TO HIMSELF
SPEAKING ONLY CASUALLY ABOUT THE INTERESTS OF THE OTHER ABLE TO RAISE
HIM TO A LEVEL ABOVE ONE'S OWN BUT ALSO ABLE AT WILL TO LET HIM DROP
AGAIN
K
STOPPED AT THE DOOR OF THE LAWYER'S OFFICE OPENED IT AND TO
THE BUSINESSMAN WHO HAD OBEDIENTLY GONE AHEAD CALLED NOT SO FAST
BRING SOME LIGHT HERE K
THOUGHT LENI MIGHT HAVE HIDDEN IN HERE HE
LET THE BUSINESSMAN SEARCH IN EVERY CORNER BUT THE ROOM WAS EMPTY
IN
FRONT OF THE PICTURE OF THE JUDGE K
TOOK HOLD OF THE BUSINESSMAN'S
BRACES TO STOP HIM MOVING ON
DO YOU KNOW HIM HE ASKED POINTING
UPWARDS WITH HIS FINGER
THE BUSINESSMAN LIFTED THE CANDLE BLINKED AS
HE LOOKED UP AND SAID IT'S A JUDGE AN IMPORTANT JUDGE ASKED K
AND STOOD TO THE SIDE AND IN FRONT OF THE BUSINESSMAN SO THAT HE COULD
OBSERVE WHAT IMPRESSION THE PICTURE HAD ON HIM
THE BUSINESSMAN WAS
LOOKING UP IN ADMIRATION
HE'S AN IMPORTANT JUDGE YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH INSIGHT SAID K
HE IS THE LOWEST OF THE LOWEST EXAMINING
JUDGES I REMEMBER NOW SAID THE BUSINESSMAN AS HE LOWERED THE
CANDLE THAT'S WHAT I'VE ALREADY BEEN TOLD WELL OF COURSE YOU
HAVE CALLED OUT K I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT OF COURSE YOU WOULD
ALREADY HAVE BEEN TOLD BUT WHY WHY ASKED THE BUSINESSMAN AS HE
MOVED FORWARDS TOWARDS THE DOOR PROPELLED BY THE HANDS OF K
OUTSIDE
IN THE CORRIDOR K
SAID
YOU KNOW WHERE LENI'S HIDDEN DO YOU HIDDEN SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
NO BUT SHE MIGHT BE IN THE KITCHEN COOKING SOUP FOR THE LAWYER WHY
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT IMMEDIATELY ASKED K
I WAS GOING TO TAKE YOU
THERE BUT YOU CALLED ME BACK AGAIN ANSWERED THE BUSINESSMAN AS IF
CONFUSED BY THE CONTRADICTORY COMMANDS
YOU THINK YOU'RE VERY CLEVER
DON'T YOU SAID K NOW TAKE ME THERE K
HAD NEVER BEEN IN THE
KITCHEN IT WAS SURPRISINGLY BIG AND VERY WELL EQUIPPED
THE STOVE
ALONE WAS THREE TIMES BIGGER THAN NORMAL STOVES BUT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
TO SEE ANY DETAIL BEYOND THIS AS THE KITCHEN WAS AT THE TIME ILLUMINATED
BY NO MORE THAN A SMALL LAMP HANGING BY THE ENTRANCE
AT THE STOVE
STOOD LENI IN A WHITE APRON AS ALWAYS BREAKING EGGS INTO A POT
STANDING ON A SPIRIT LAMP
GOOD EVENING JOSEF SHE SAID WITH A GLANCE SIDEWAYS
GOOD EVENING
SAID K POINTING WITH ONE HAND TO A CHAIR IN A CORNER WHICH THE
BUSINESSMAN WAS TO SIT ON AND HE DID INDEED SIT DOWN ON IT
K
HOWEVER
WENT VERY CLOSE BEHIND LENI'S BACK LEANT OVER HER SHOULDER AND ASKED
WHO IS THIS MAN LENI PUT ONE HAND AROUND K
AS SHE STIRRED THE SOUP
WITH THE OTHER SHE DREW HIM FORWARD TOWARD HERSELF AND SAID HE'S A
PITIFUL CHARACTER A POOR BUSINESSMAN BY THE NAME OF BLOCK
JUST LOOK
AT HIM THE TWO OF THEM LOOKED BACK OVER THEIR SHOULDERS
THE
BUSINESSMAN WAS SITTING ON THE CHAIR THAT K
HAD DIRECTED HIM TO HE HAD
EXTINGUISHED THE CANDLE WHOSE LIGHT WAS NO LONGER NEEDED AND PRESSED ON
THE WICK WITH HIS FINGERS TO STOP THE SMOKE
YOU WERE IN YOUR
NIGHTSHIRT SAID K PUTTING HIS HAND ON HER HEAD AND TURNING IT BACK
TOWARDS THE STOVE
SHE WAS SILENT
IS HE YOUR LOVER ASKED K
SHE
WAS ABOUT TO TAKE HOLD OF THE POT OF SOUP BUT K
TOOK BOTH HER HANDS
AND SAID ANSWER ME SHE SAID COME INTO THE OFFICE I'LL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TO YOU NO SAID K I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN IT HERE
SHE PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND WANTED TO KISS HIM
K THOUGH PUSHED
HER AWAY AND SAID I DON'T WANT YOU TO KISS ME NOW JOSEF SAID
LENI LOOKING AT K
IMPLORINGLY BUT FRANKLY IN THE EYES YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE JEALOUS OF MR
BLOCK NOW ARE YOU RUDI SHE THEN SAID
TURNING TO THE BUSINESSMAN HELP ME OUT WILL YOU I'M BEING SUSPECTED
OF SOMETHING YOU CAN SEE THAT LEAVE THE CANDLE ALONE IT HAD LOOKED
AS THOUGH MR
BLOCK HAD NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION BUT HE HAD BEEN
FOLLOWING CLOSELY
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU MIGHT BE JEALOUS HE
SAID INGENUOUSLY
NOR DO I ACTUALLY SAID K LOOKING AT THE
BUSINESSMAN WITH A SMILE
LENI LAUGHED OUT LOUD AND WHILE K
WAS NOT
PAYING ATTENTION TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF EMBRACING HIM AND WHISPERING
LEAVE HIM ALONE NOW YOU CAN SEE WHAT SORT OF PERSON HE IS
I'VE BEEN
HELPING HIM A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE HE'S AN IMPORTANT CLIENT OF THE
LAWYER'S AND NO OTHER REASON
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU DO YOU WANT TO
SPEAK TO THE LAWYER AT THIS TIME OF DAY HE'S VERY UNWELL TODAY BUT IF
YOU WANT I'LL TELL HIM YOU'RE HERE
BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY SPEND THE
NIGHT WITH ME
IT'S SO LONG SINCE YOU WERE LAST HERE EVEN THE LAWYER
HAS BEEN ASKING ABOUT YOU
DON'T NEGLECT YOUR CASE AND I'VE GOT SOME
THINGS TO TELL YOU THAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT
BUT NOW BEFORE ANYTHING
ELSE TAKE YOUR COAT OFF SHE HELPED HIM OFF WITH HIS COAT TOOK THE
HAT OFF HIS HEAD RAN WITH THE THINGS INTO THE HALLWAY TO HANG THEM UP
THEN SHE RAN BACK AND SAW TO THE SOUP
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM
YOU'RE HERE STRAIGHT AWAY OR TAKE HIM HIS SOUP FIRST TELL HIM I'M
HERE FIRST SAID K
HE WAS IN A BAD MOOD HE HAD ORIGINALLY INTENDED A
DETAILED DISCUSSION OF HIS BUSINESS WITH LENI ESPECIALLY THE QUESTION
OF HIS GIVING THE LAWYER NOTICE BUT NOW HE NO LONGER WANTED TO BECAUSE
OF THE PRESENCE OF THE BUSINESSMAN
NOW HE CONSIDERED HIS AFFAIR TOO
IMPORTANT TO LET THIS LITTLE BUSINESSMAN TAKE PART IN IT AND PERHAPS
CHANGE SOME OF HIS DECISIONS AND SO
HE CALLED LENI BACK EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS ALREADY ON HER WAY TO THE
LAWYER
BRING HIM HIS SOUP FIRST HE SAID I WANT HIM TO GET HIS
STRENGTH UP FOR THE DISCUSSION WITH ME HE'LL NEED IT YOU'RE A
CLIENT OF THE LAWYER'S TOO AREN'T YOU SAID THE BUSINESSMAN QUIETLY
FROM HIS CORNER AS IF HE WERE TRYING TO FIND THIS OUT
IT WAS NOT
HOWEVER TAKEN WELL
WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT OF YOURS SAID K AND
LENI SAID
WILL YOU BE QUIET
I'LL TAKE HIM HIS SOUP FIRST THEN SHALL I AND
SHE POURED THE SOUP INTO A DISH
THE ONLY WORRY THEN IS THAT HE MIGHT
GO TO SLEEP SOON AFTER HE'S EATEN WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY TO HIM WILL
KEEP HIM AWAKE SAID K WHO STILL WANTED TO INTIMATE THAT HE INTENDED
SOME IMPORTANT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LAWYER HE WANTED LENI TO ASK HIM
WHAT IT WAS AND ONLY THEN TO ASK HER ADVICE
BUT INSTEAD SHE JUST
PROMPTLY CARRIED OUT THE ORDER HE HAD GIVEN HER
WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO
HIM WITH THE DISH SHE DELIBERATELY BRUSHED AGAINST HIM AND WHISPERED
I'LL TELL HIM YOU'RE HERE AS SOON AS HE'S EATEN THE SOUP SO THAT I CAN
GET YOU BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE JUST GO SAID K JUST GO BE
A BIT MORE FRIENDLY SHE SAID AND STILL HOLDING THE DISH TURNED
COMPLETELY ROUND ONCE MORE IN THE DOORWAY
K
WATCHED HER AS SHE WENT THE DECISION HAD FINALLY BEEN MADE
THAT THE LAWYER WAS TO BE DISMISSED IT WAS PROBABLY BETTER THAT HE HAD
NOT BEEN ABLE TO DISCUSS THE MATTER ANY MORE WITH LENI BEFOREHAND SHE
HARDLY UNDERSTOOD THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MATTER SHE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
ADVISED HIM AGAINST IT AND PERHAPS WOULD EVEN HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM
DISMISSING THE LAWYER THIS TIME HE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN DOUBT AND
UNEASE AND EVENTUALLY HAVE CARRIED OUT HIS DECISION AFTER A WHILE ANYWAY
AS THIS DECISION WAS SOMETHING HE COULD NOT AVOID
THE SOONER IT WAS
CARRIED OUT THE MORE HARM WOULD BE AVOIDED
AND MOREOVER PERHAPS THE
BUSINESSMAN HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE MATTER
K
TURNED ROUND THE BUSINESSMAN HARDLY NOTICED IT AS HE WAS ABOUT
TO STAND UP
STAY WHERE YOU ARE SAID K
AND PULLED UP A CHAIR BESIDE
HIM
HAVE YOU BEEN A CLIENT OF THE LAWYER'S FOR A LONG TIME ASKED K
YES SAID THE BUSINESSMAN A VERY LONG TIME HOW MANY YEARS HAS HE
BEEN REPRESENTING YOU SO FAR THEN ASKED K
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
MEAN SAID THE BUSINESSMAN HE'S BEEN MY BUSINESS LAWYER I BUY AND
SELL CEREALS HE'S BEEN MY BUSINESS LAWYER SINCE I TOOK THE BUSINESS
OVER AND THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY YEARS NOW BUT PERHAPS YOU MEAN MY OWN
TRIAL AND HE'S BEEN REPRESENTING ME IN THAT SINCE IT STARTED AND THAT'S
BEEN MORE THAN FIVE YEARS
YES WELL OVER FIVE YEARS HE THEN ADDED
PULLING OUT AN OLD BRIEFCASE I'VE GOT EVERYTHING WRITTEN DOWN I CAN
TELL YOU THE EXACT DATES IF YOU LIKE
IT'S SO HARD TO REMEMBER
EVERYTHING
PROBABLY MY TRIAL'S BEEN GOING ON MUCH LONGER THAN THAT
IT STARTED SOON AFTER THE DEATH OF MY WIFE AND THAT'S BEEN MORE THAN
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS NOW K
MOVED IN CLOSER TO HIM
SO THE LAWYER
TAKES ON ORDINARY LEGAL BUSINESS DOES HE HE ASKED
THIS COMBINATION
OF CRIMINAL AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESS SEEMED SURPRISINGLY REASSURING FOR
K
OH YES SAID THE BUSINESSMAN AND THEN HE WHISPERED THEY EVEN
SAY HE'S MORE EFFICIENT IN JURISPRUDENCE THAN HE IS IN OTHER MATTERS
BUT THEN HE SEEMED TO REGRET SAYING THIS AND HE LAID A HAND ON K 'S
SHOULDER AND SAID PLEASE DON'T BETRAY ME TO HIM WILL YOU K
PATTED
HIS THIGH TO REASSURE HIM AND SAID NO I DON'T BETRAY PEOPLE HE
CAN BE SO VINDICTIVE YOU SEE SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
I'M SURE HE WON'T DO ANYTHING AGAINST SUCH A FAITHFUL CLIENT AS YOU
SAID K
OH HE MIGHT DO SAID THE BUSINESSMAN WHEN HE GETS CROSS IT
DOESN'T MATTER WHO IT IS AND ANYWAY I'M NOT REALLY FAITHFUL TO HIM
HOW'S THAT THEN ASKED K
I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD TELL YOU ABOUT IT
SAID THE BUSINESSMAN HESITANTLY
I THINK IT'LL BE ALRIGHT SAID K
WELL THEN SAID THE BUSINESSMAN I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF IT BUT
YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME A SECRET TOO THEN WE CAN SUPPORT EACH OTHER WITH
THE LAWYER YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL SAID K BUT I'LL TELL YOU A
SECRET THAT WILL SET YOUR MIND COMPLETELY AT EASE
NOW TELL ME IN WHAT
WAY HAVE YOU BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO THE LAWYER I'VE SAID THE
BUSINESSMAN HESITANTLY AND IN A TONE AS IF HE WERE CONFESSING SOMETHING
DISHONOURABLE I'VE TAKEN ON OTHER LAWYERS BESIDES HIM THAT'S NOT
SO SERIOUS SAID K A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
IT IS HERE SAID THE
BUSINESSMAN WHO HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY BREATHING SINCE MAKING HIS
CONFESSION BUT WHO NOW AFTER HEARING K 'S COMMENT BEGAN TO FEEL MORE
TRUST FOR HIM
THAT'S NOT ALLOWED
AND IT'S ALLOWED LEAST OF ALL TO
TAKE ON PETTY LAWYERS WHEN YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A PROPER ONE
AND THAT'S
JUST WHAT I HAVE DONE BESIDES HIM I'VE GOT FIVE PETTY LAWYERS
FIVE EXCLAIMED K ASTONISHED AT THIS NUMBER FIVE LAWYERS BESIDES
THIS ONE THE BUSINESSMAN NODDED
I'M EVEN NEGOTIATING WITH A SIXTH
ONE BUT WHY DO YOU NEED SO MANY LAWYERS ASKED K
I NEED ALL OF
THEM SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
WOULD YOU MIND EXPLAINING THAT TO ME
ASKED K
I'D BE GLAD TO SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
MOST OF ALL I DON'T
WANT TO LOSE MY CASE WELL THAT'S OBVIOUS
SO THAT MEANS I MUSTN'T
NEGLECT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE OF USE TO ME EVEN IF THERE'S VERY LITTLE
HOPE OF A PARTICULAR THING BEING OF ANY USE I CAN'T JUST THROW IT AWAY
SO EVERYTHING I HAVE I'VE PUT TO USE IN MY CASE
I'VE TAKEN ALL THE
MONEY OUT OF MY BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE THE OFFICES FOR MY BUSINESS USED
TO OCCUPY NEARLY A WHOLE FLOOR BUT NOW ALL I NEED IS A LITTLE ROOM AT
THE BACK WHERE I WORK WITH ONE APPRENTICE
IT WASN'T JUST USING UP THE
MONEY THAT CAUSED THE DIFFICULTY OF COURSE IT WAS MUCH MORE TO DO WITH
ME NOT WORKING AT THE BUSINESS AS MUCH AS I USED TO
IF YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR TRIAL YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE
SO YOU'RE ALSO WORKING AT THE COURT YOURSELF ASKED K
THAT'S JUST
WHAT I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT I CAN'T TELL YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT
THAT SAID THE BUSINESSMAN AT FIRST I TRIED TO DO THAT TOO BUT I SOON
HAD TO GIVE IT UP AGAIN
IT WEARS YOU OUT TOO MUCH AND IT'S REALLY NOT
MUCH USE
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO WORK THERE
YOURSELF AND TO NEGOTIATE AT LEAST FOR ME IT WAS
IT'S A HEAVY STRAIN
THERE JUST SITTING AND WAITING
YOU KNOW YOURSELF WHAT THE AIR IS LIKE
IN THOSE OFFICES HOW DO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN THERE THEN ASKED K
I WAS IN THE WAITING ROOM MYSELF WHEN YOU WENT THROUGH WHAT A
COINCIDENCE THAT IS EXCLAIMED K TOTALLY ENGROSSED AND FORGETTING HOW
RIDICULOUS THE BUSINESSMAN HAD SEEMED TO HIM EARLIER
SO YOU SAW ME
YOU WERE IN THE WAITING ROOM WHEN I WENT THROUGH
YES I DID GO THROUGH
IT ONE TIME IT ISN'T SUCH A BIG COINCIDENCE SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
I'M THERE NEARLY EVERY DAY I EXPECT I'LL HAVE TO GO THERE QUITE
OFTEN MYSELF NOW SAID K ALTHOUGH I CAN HARDLY EXPECT TO BE SHOWN
THE SAME RESPECT AS I WAS THEN
THEY ALL STOOD UP FOR ME
THEY MUST
HAVE THOUGHT I WAS A JUDGE NO SAID THE BUSINESSMAN WE WERE
GREETING THE SERVANT OF THE COURT
WE KNEW YOU WERE A DEFENDANT
THAT
SORT OF NEWS SPREADS VERY QUICKLY SO YOU ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THAT
SAID K THE WAY I BEHAVED MUST HAVE SEEMED VERY ARROGANT TO YOU
DID
YOU CRITICISE ME FOR IT AFTERWARDS NO SAID THE BUSINESSMAN QUITE
THE OPPOSITE
THAT WAS JUST STUPIDITY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
'STUPIDITY' ASKED K
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT IT SAID THE
BUSINESSMAN IN SOME IRRITATION
YOU STILL DON'T SEEM TO KNOW THE
PEOPLE THERE AND YOU MIGHT TAKE IT WRONG
DON'T FORGET IN PROCEEDINGS
LIKE THIS THERE ARE ALWAYS LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS COMING UP TO TALK
ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WITH REASON ALONE YOU JUST
GET TOO TIRED AND DISTRACTED FOR MOST THINGS AND SO INSTEAD PEOPLE
RELY ON SUPERSTITION
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE OTHERS BUT I'M NO BETTER
MYSELF
ONE OF THESE SUPERSTITIONS FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT YOU CAN LEARN
A LOT ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF A DEFENDANT'S CASE BY LOOKING AT HIS FACE
ESPECIALLY THE SHAPE OF HIS LIPS
THERE ARE LOTS WHO BELIEVE THAT AND
THEY SAID THEY COULD SEE FROM THE SHAPE OF YOUR LIPS THAT YOU'D
DEFINITELY BE FOUND GUILTY VERY SOON
I REPEAT THAT ALL THIS IS JUST A
RIDICULOUS SUPERSTITION AND IN MOST CASES IT'S COMPLETELY DISPROVED BY
THE FACTS BUT WHEN YOU LIVE IN THAT SOCIETY IT'S HARD TO HOLD YOURSELF
BACK FROM BELIEFS LIKE THAT
JUST THINK HOW MUCH EFFECT THAT
SUPERSTITION CAN HAVE
YOU SPOKE TO ONE OF THEM THERE DIDN'T YOU HE
WAS HARDLY ABLE TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THERE
THAT CAN MAKE YOU CONFUSED OF COURSE BUT ONE OF THEM FOR HIM WAS THE
APPEARANCE OF YOUR LIPS
HE TOLD US ALL LATER HE THOUGHT HE COULD SEE
SOMETHING IN YOUR LIPS THAT MEANT HE'D BE CONVICTED HIMSELF ON MY
LIPS ASKED K PULLING OUT A POCKET MIRROR AND EXAMINING HIMSELF
I
CAN SEE NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT MY LIPS
CAN YOU NOR CAN I SAID THE
BUSINESSMAN NOTHING AT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE SO SUPERSTITIOUS
EXCLAIMED K
ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU ASKED THE BUSINESSMAN
DO YOU THEN HAVE THAT MUCH CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER EXCHANGING EACH
OTHER'S OPINIONS SAID K
I'VE KEPT MYSELF COMPLETELY APART SO FAR
THEY DON'T NORMALLY HAVE MUCH CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER SAID THE
BUSINESSMAN THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM
AND
THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH IN COMMON EITHER
IF A GROUP OF THEM EVER THINKS
THEY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING IN COMMON IT SOON TURNS OUT THEY WERE
MISTAKEN
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO AS A GROUP WHERE THE COURT'S
CONCERNED
EACH CASE IS EXAMINED SEPARATELY THE COURT IS VERY
PAINSTAKING
SO THERE'S NOTHING TO BE ACHIEVED BY FORMING INTO A GROUP
ONLY SOMETIMES AN INDIVIDUAL WILL ACHIEVE SOMETHING IN SECRET AND IT'S
ONLY WHEN THAT'S BEEN DONE THE OTHERS LEARN ABOUT IT NOBODY KNOWS HOW
IT WAS DONE
SO THERE'S NO SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS YOU MEET PEOPLE NOW
AND THEN IN THE WAITING ROOMS BUT WE DON'T TALK MUCH THERE
THE
SUPERSTITIOUS BELIEFS WERE ESTABLISHED A LONG TIME AGO AND THEY SPREAD
ALL BY THEMSELVES I SAW THOSE GENTLEMEN IN THE WAITING ROOM SAID
K IT SEEMED SO POINTLESS FOR THEM TO BE WAITING IN THAT WAY
WAITING IS NOT POINTLESS SAID THE BUSINESSMAN IT'S ONLY POINTLESS
IF YOU TRY AND INTERFERE YOURSELF
I TOLD YOU JUST NOW I'VE GOT FIVE
LAWYERS BESIDES THIS ONE
YOU MIGHT THINK I THOUGHT IT MYSELF AT
FIRST YOU MIGHT THINK I COULD LEAVE THE WHOLE THING ENTIRELY UP TO
THEM NOW
THAT WOULD BE ENTIRELY WRONG
I CAN LEAVE IT UP TO THEM LESS
THAN WHEN I HAD JUST THE ONE
MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT DO YOU
NO SAID K AND TO SLOW THE BUSINESSMAN DOWN WHO HAD BEEN SPEAKING
TOO FAST HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE BUSINESSMAN'S TO REASSURE HIM BUT
I'D LIKE JUST TO ASK YOU TO SPEAK A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY THESE ARE MANY
VERY IMPORTANT THINGS FOR ME AND I CAN'T FOLLOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT TO REMIND ME OF THAT SAID THE
BUSINESSMAN YOU'RE NEW TO ALL THIS A JUNIOR
YOUR TRIAL IS SIX
MONTHS OLD ISN'T IT YES I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT
SUCH A NEW CASE BUT
I'VE ALREADY THOUGHT ALL THESE THINGS THROUGH COUNTLESS TIMES TO ME
THEY'RE THE MOST OBVIOUS THINGS IN THE WORLD YOU MUST BE GLAD YOUR
TRIAL HAS ALREADY PROGRESSED SO FAR ARE YOU ASKED K HE DID NOT WISH
TO ASK DIRECTLY HOW THE BUSINESSMAN'S AFFAIRS STOOD BUT RECEIVED NO
CLEAR ANSWER ANYWAY
YES I'VE BEEN WORKING AT MY TRIAL FOR FIVE YEARS
NOW SAID THE BUSINESSMAN AS HIS HEAD SANK THAT'S NO SMALL
ACHIEVEMENT THEN HE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE
K
LISTENED TO HEAR
WHETHER LENI WAS ON HER WAY BACK
ON THE ONE HAND HE DID NOT WANT HER
TO COME BACK TOO SOON AS HE STILL HAD MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK AND DID NOT
WANT HER TO FIND HIM IN THIS INTIMATE DISCUSSION WITH THE BUSINESSMAN
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IRRITATED HIM THAT SHE STAYED SO LONG WITH THE
LAWYER WHEN K
WAS THERE MUCH LONGER THAN SHE NEEDED TO GIVE HIM HIS
SOUP
I STILL REMEMBER IT EXACTLY THE BUSINESSMAN BEGAN AGAIN AND
K
IMMEDIATELY GAVE HIM HIS FULL ATTENTION WHEN MY CASE WAS AS OLD AS
YOURS IS NOW
I ONLY HAD THIS ONE LAWYER AT THAT TIME BUT I WASN'T VERY
SATISFIED WITH HIM NOW I'LL FIND OUT EVERYTHING THOUGHT K NODDING
VIGOROUSLY AS IF HE COULD THEREBY ENCOURAGE THE BUSINESSMAN TO SAY
EVERYTHING WORTH KNOWING
MY CASE THE BUSINESSMAN CONTINUED DIDN'T
MOVE ON AT ALL THERE WERE SOME HEARINGS THAT TOOK PLACE AND I WENT TO
EVERY ONE OF THEM COLLECTED MATERIALS HANDED ALL MY BUSINESS BOOKS TO
THE COURT WHICH I LATER FOUND WAS ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY I RAN BACK
AND FORTH TO THE LAWYER AND HE SUBMITTED VARIOUS DOCUMENTS TO THE COURT
TOO VARIOUS DOCUMENTS ASKED K
YES THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE
BUSINESSMAN
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME SAID K IN MY CASE HE'S
STILL WORKING ON THE FIRST SET OF DOCUMENTS
HE STILL HASN'T DONE
ANYTHING
I SEE NOW THAT HE'S BEEN NEGLECTING ME QUITE DISGRACEFULLY
THERE CAN BE LOTS OF GOOD REASONS WHY THE FIRST DOCUMENTS STILL AREN'T
READY SAID THE BUSINESSMAN AND ANYWAY IT TURNED OUT LATER ON THAT
THE ONES HE SUBMITTED FOR ME WERE ENTIRELY WORTHLESS
I EVEN READ ONE
OF THEM MYSELF ONE OF THE OFFICIALS AT THE COURT WAS VERY HELPFUL
IT
WAS VERY LEARNED BUT IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY ANYTHING
MOST OF ALL
THERE WAS LOTS OF LATIN WHICH I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEN PAGES AND PAGES
OF GENERAL APPEALS TO THE COURT THEN LOTS OF FLATTERY FOR PARTICULAR
OFFICIALS THEY WEREN'T NAMED THESE OFFICIALS BUT ANYONE FAMILIAR WITH
THE COURT MUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GUESS WHO THEY WERE THEN THERE WAS
SELF PRAISE BY THE LAWYER WHERE HE HUMILIATED HIMSELF TO THE COURT IN A
WAY THAT WAS DOWNRIGHT DOG LIKE AND THEN ENDLESS INVESTIGATIONS OF
CASES FROM THE PAST WHICH WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SIMILAR TO MINE
ALTHOUGH AS FAR AS I WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THEM THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAD
BEEN CARRIED OUT VERY CAREFULLY
NOW I DON'T MEAN TO CRITICISE THE
LAWYER'S WORK WITH ALL OF THIS AND THE DOCUMENT I READ WAS ONLY ONE OF
MANY BUT EVEN SO AND THIS IS SOMETHING I WILL SAY AT THAT TIME I
COULDN'T SEE ANY PROGRESS IN MY TRIAL AT ALL AND WHAT SORT OF
PROGRESS HAD YOU BEEN HOPING FOR ASKED K
THAT'S A VERY SENSIBLE
QUESTION SAID THE BUSINESSMAN WITH A SMILE IT'S ONLY VERY RARE THAT
YOU SEE ANY PROGRESS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS AT ALL
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THEN
I'M A BUSINESSMAN MUCH MORE IN THOSE DAYS THAN NOW I
WANTED TO SEE SOME TANGIBLE PROGRESS IT SHOULD HAVE ALL BEEN MOVING TO
SOME CONCLUSION OR AT LEAST SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOVING ON IN SOME WAY
ACCORDING TO THE RULES
INSTEAD OF WHICH THERE WERE JUST MORE HEARINGS
AND MOST OF THEM WENT THROUGH THE SAME THINGS ANYWAY I HAD ALL THE
ANSWERS OFF PAT LIKE IN A CHURCH SERVICE THERE WERE MESSENGERS FROM THE
COURT COMING TO ME AT WORK SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK OR THEY CAME TO ME AT
HOME OR ANYWHERE ELSE THEY COULD FIND ME AND THAT WAS VERY DISTURBING
OF COURSE BUT AT LEAST NOW THINGS ARE BETTER IN THAT RESPECT IT'S MUCH
LESS DISTURBING WHEN THEY CONTACT YOU BY TELEPHONE AND RUMOURS ABOUT
MY TRIAL EVEN STARTED TO SPREAD AMONG SOME OF THE PEOPLE I DO BUSINESS
WITH AND ESPECIALLY MY RELATIONS SO I WAS BEING MADE TO SUFFER IN MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS BUT THERE WAS STILL NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIGN THAT EVEN THE
FIRST HEARING WOULD TAKE PLACE SOON
SO I WENT TO THE LAWYER AND
COMPLAINED ABOUT IT
HE EXPLAINED IT ALL TO ME AT LENGTH BUT REFUSED
TO DO ANYTHING I ASKED FOR NO ONE HAS ANY INFLUENCE ON THE WAY THE
TRIAL PROCEEDS HE SAID TO TRY AND INSIST ON IT IN ANY OF THE DOCUMENTS
SUBMITTED LIKE I WAS ASKING WAS SIMPLY UNHEARD OF AND WOULD DO HARM
TO BOTH HIM AND ME
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHAT THIS LAWYER CAN'T OR
WON'T DO ANOTHER LAWYER WILL
SO I LOOKED ROUND FOR OTHER LAWYERS
AND
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING NONE OF THEM ASKED FOR A DEFINITE DATE FOR THE
MAIN TRIAL AND NONE OF THEM GOT ONE AND ANYWAY APART FROM ONE
EXCEPTION WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE IT REALLY IS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT'S ONE THING THIS LAWYER DIDN'T MISLEAD ME ABOUT BUT BESIDES I HAD
NO REASON TO REGRET TURNING TO OTHER LAWYERS
PERHAPS YOU'VE ALREADY
HEARD HOW DR
HULD TALKS ABOUT THE PETTY LAWYERS HE PROBABLY MADE THEM
SOUND VERY CONTEMPTIBLE TO YOU AND HE'S RIGHT THEY ARE CONTEMPTIBLE
BUT WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THEM AND COMPARES THEM WITH HIMSELF AND HIS
COLLEAGUES THERE'S A SMALL ERROR RUNNING THROUGH WHAT HE SAYS AND JUST
FOR YOUR INTEREST I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT
WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE
LAWYERS HE MIXES WITH HE SETS THEM APART BY CALLING THEM THE 'GREAT
LAWYERS'
THAT'S WRONG ANYONE CAN CALL HIMSELF 'GREAT' IF HE WANTS TO
OF COURSE BUT IN THIS CASE ONLY THE USAGE OF THE COURT CAN MAKE THAT
DISTINCTION
YOU SEE THE COURT SAYS THAT BESIDES THE PETTY LAWYERS
THERE ARE ALSO MINOR LAWYERS AND GREAT LAWYERS
THIS ONE AND HIS
COLLEAGUES ARE ONLY MINOR LAWYERS AND THE DIFFERENCE IN RANK BETWEEN
THEM AND THE GREAT LAWYERS WHO I'VE ONLY EVER HEARD ABOUT AND NEVER
SEEN IS INCOMPARABLY GREATER THAN BETWEEN THE MINOR LAWYERS AND THE
DESPISED PETTY LAWYERS THE GREAT LAWYERS ASKED K
WHO ARE THEY
THEN HOW DO YOU CONTACT THEM YOU'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT THEM THEN
SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
THERE'S HARDLY ANYONE WHO'S BEEN ACCUSED WHO
DOESN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME DREAMING ABOUT THE GREAT LAWYERS ONCE HE'S
HEARD ABOUT THEM
IT'S BEST IF YOU DON'T LET YOURSELF BE MISLED IN THAT
WAY
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE GREAT LAWYERS ARE AND THERE'S PROBABLY NO
WAY OF CONTACTING THEM
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY CASE I CAN TALK ABOUT WITH
CERTAINTY WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN ANY PART
THEY DO DEFEND A LOT OF PEOPLE
BUT YOU CAN'T GET HOLD OF THEM BY YOUR OWN EFFORTS THEY ONLY DEFEND
THOSE WHO THEY WANT TO DEFEND
AND I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY EVER TAKE ON
CASES THAT HAVEN'T ALREADY GOT PAST THE LOWER COURTS
ANYWAY IT'S BEST
NOT TO THINK ABOUT THEM AS IF YOU DO IT MAKES THE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE
OTHER LAWYERS ALL THEIR ADVICE AND ALL THAT THEY DO MANAGE TO ACHIEVE
SEEM SO UNPLEASANT AND USELESS I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE MYSELF JUST
WANTED TO THROW EVERYTHING AWAY AND LAY AT HOME IN BED AND HEAR NOTHING
MORE ABOUT IT
BUT THAT OF COURSE WOULD BE THE STUPIDEST THING YOU
COULD DO AND YOU WOULDN'T BE LEFT IN PEACE IN BED FOR VERY LONG
EITHER SO YOU WEREN'T THINKING ABOUT THE GREAT LAWYERS AT THAT
TIME ASKED K
NOT FOR VERY LONG SAID THE BUSINESSMAN AND SMILED
AGAIN YOU CAN'T FORGET ABOUT THEM ENTIRELY I'M AFRAID ESPECIALLY IN
THE NIGHT WHEN THESE THOUGHTS COME SO EASILY
BUT I WANTED IMMEDIATE
RESULTS IN THOSE DAYS SO I WENT TO THE PETTY LAWYERS
WELL LOOK AT YOU TWO SAT HUDDLED TOGETHER CALLED LENI AS SHE
CAME BACK WITH THE DISH AND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
THEY WERE INDEED SAT
CLOSE TOGETHER IF EITHER OF THEM TURNED HIS HEAD EVEN SLIGHTLY IT WOULD
HAVE KNOCKED AGAINST THE OTHER'S THE BUSINESSMAN WAS NOT ONLY VERY
SMALL BUT ALSO SAT HUNCHED DOWN SO THAT K
WAS ALSO FORCED TO BEND DOWN
LOW IF HE WANTED TO HEAR EVERYTHING
NOT QUITE YET CALLED OUT K TO
TURN LENI AWAY HIS HAND STILL RESTING ON THE BUSINESSMAN'S HAND
TWITCHING WITH IMPATIENCE
HE WANTED ME TO TELL HIM ABOUT MY TRIAL
SAID THE BUSINESSMAN TO LENI
CARRY ON THEN CARRY ON SHE SAID
SHE SPOKE TO THE BUSINESSMAN WITH AFFECTION BUT AT THE SAME TIME WITH
CONDESCENSION
K
DID NOT LIKE THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THAT THE MAN
WAS OF SOME VALUE AFTER ALL HE HAD EXPERIENCE AT LEAST AND HE WAS
WILLING TO SHARE IT
LENI WAS PROBABLY WRONG ABOUT HIM
HE WATCHED HER
IN IRRITATION AS LENI NOW TOOK THE CANDLE FROM THE BUSINESSMAN'S HAND
WHICH HE HAD BEEN HOLDING ON TO ALL THIS TIME WIPED HIS HAND WITH HER
APRON AND THEN KNELT BESIDE HIM TO SCRATCH OFF SOME WAX THAT HAD DRIPPED
FROM THE CANDLE ONTO HIS TROUSERS
YOU WERE ABOUT TO TELL ME ABOUT THE
PETTY LAWYERS SAID K SHOVING LENI'S HAND AWAY WITH NO FURTHER
COMMENT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU TODAY ASKED LENI TAPPED HIM GENTLY
AND CARRIED ON WITH WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING
YES THE PETTY LAWYERS
SAID THE BUSINESSMAN PUTTING HIS HAND TO HIS BROW AS IF THINKING HARD
K
WANTED TO HELP HIM AND SAID YOU WANTED IMMEDIATE RESULTS AND SO
WENT TO THE PETTY LAWYERS
YES THAT'S RIGHT SAID THE BUSINESSMAN BUT DID NOT CONTINUE WITH
WHAT HE'D BEEN SAYING
MAYBE HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT IT IN
FRONT OF LENI THOUGHT K SUPPRESSING HIS IMPATIENCE TO HEAR THE REST
STRAIGHT AWAY AND STOPPED TRYING TO PRESS HIM
HAVE YOU TOLD HIM I'M HERE HE ASKED LENI
COURSE I HAVE SHE
SAID HE'S WAITING FOR YOU
LEAVE BLOCK ALONE NOW YOU CAN TALK TO
BLOCK LATER HE'LL STILL BE HERE K
STILL HESITATED
YOU'LL STILL
BE HERE HE ASKED THE BUSINESSMAN WANTING TO HEAR THE ANSWER FROM HIM
AND NOT WANTING LENI TO SPEAK ABOUT THE BUSINESSMAN AS IF HE WEREN'T
THERE HE WAS FULL OF SECRET RESENTMENT TOWARDS LENI TODAY
AND ONCE
MORE IT WAS ONLY LENI WHO ANSWERED
HE OFTEN SLEEPS HERE HE SLEEPS
HERE EXCLAIMED K HE HAD THOUGHT THE BUSINESSMAN WOULD JUST WAIT
THERE FOR HIM WHILE HE QUICKLY SETTLED HIS BUSINESS WITH THE LAWYER AND
THEN THEY WOULD LEAVE TOGETHER TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING THOROUGHLY AND
UNDISTURBED
YES SAID LENI NOT EVERYONE'S LIKE YOU JOSEF ALLOWED
TO SEE THE LAWYER AT ANY TIME YOU LIKE
DO DON'T EVEN SEEM SURPRISED
THAT THE LAWYER DESPITE BEING ILL STILL RECEIVES YOU AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK
AT NIGHT
YOU TAKE IT FAR TOO MUCH FOR GRANTED WHAT YOUR FRIENDS DO
FOR YOU
WELL YOUR FRIENDS OR AT LEAST I DO WE LIKE TO DO THINGS FOR
YOU
I DON'T WANT OR NEED ANY MORE THANKS THAN THAT YOU'RE FOND OF ME
FOND OF YOU THOUGHT K
AT FIRST AND ONLY THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM
WELL YES I AM FOND OF HER NONETHELESS WHAT HE SAID FORGETTING ALL
THE REST WAS HE RECEIVES ME BECAUSE I AM HIS CLIENT
IF I NEEDED
ANYONE ELSE'S HELP I'D HAVE TO BEG AND SHOW GRATITUDE WHENEVER I DO
ANYTHING HE'S REALLY NASTY TODAY ISN'T HE LENI ASKED THE
BUSINESSMAN
NOW IT'S ME WHO'S NOT HERE THOUGHT K AND NEARLY LOST
HIS TEMPER WITH THE BUSINESSMAN WHEN WITH THE SAME RUDENESS AS LENI HE
SAID THE LAWYER ALSO HAS OTHER REASONS TO RECEIVE HIM
HIS CASE IS
MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN MINE
AND IT'S ONLY IN ITS EARLY STAGES TOO
IT PROBABLY HASN'T PROGRESSED VERY FAR SO THE LAWYER STILL LIKES TO DEAL
WITH HIM
THAT'LL ALL CHANGE LATER ON YEAH YEAH SAID LENI
LOOKING AT THE BUSINESSMAN AND LAUGHING
HE DOESN'T HALF TALK SHE
SAID TURNING TO FACE K
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE A WORD HE SAYS
HE'S AS
TALKATIVE AS HE IS SWEET
MAYBE THAT'S WHY THE LAWYER CAN'T STAND HIM
AT LEAST HE ONLY SEES HIM WHEN HE'S IN THE RIGHT MOOD
I'VE ALREADY
TRIED HARD TO CHANGE THAT BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
JUST THINK THERE ARE
TIMES WHEN I TELL HIM BLOCK'S HERE AND HE DOESN'T RECEIVE HIM UNTIL
THREE DAYS LATER
AND IF BLOCK ISN'T ON THE SPOT WHEN HE'S CALLED THEN
EVERYTHING'S LOST AND IT ALL HAS TO START ALL OVER AGAIN
THAT'S WHY I
LET BLOCK SLEEP HERE IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME DR
HULD HAS WANTED
TO SEE HIM IN THE NIGHT
SO NOW BLOCK IS READY FOR THAT
SOMETIMES
WHEN HE KNOWS BLOCK IS STILL HERE HE'LL EVEN CHANGE HIS MIND ABOUT
LETTING HIM IN TO SEE HIM K
LOOKED QUESTIONINGLY AT THE BUSINESSMAN
THE LATTER NODDED AND ALTHOUGH HE HAD SPOKEN QUITE OPENLY WITH K
EARLIER SEEMED TO BE CONFUSED WITH SHAME AS HE SAID YES LATER ON YOU
BECOME VERY DEPENDENT ON YOUR LAWYER HE'S ONLY PRETENDING TO MIND
SAID LENI
HE LIKES TO SLEEP HERE REALLY HE'S OFTEN SAID SO SHE
WENT OVER TO A LITTLE DOOR AND SHOVED IT OPEN
DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIS
BEDROOM SHE ASKED
K
WENT OVER TO THE LOW WINDOWLESS ROOM AND
LOOKED IN FROM THE DOORWAY
THE ROOM CONTAINED A NARROW BED WHICH
FILLED IT COMPLETELY SO THAT TO GET INTO THE BED YOU WOULD NEED TO
CLIMB OVER THE BEDPOST
AT THE HEAD OF THE BED THERE WAS A NICHE IN THE
WALL WHERE FASTIDIOUSLY TIDY STOOD A CANDLE A BOTTLE OF INK AND A
PEN WITH A BUNDLE OF PAPERS WHICH WERE PROBABLY TO DO WITH THE TRIAL
YOU SLEEP IN THE MAID'S ROOM ASKED K AS HE WENT BACK TO THE
BUSINESSMAN
LENI'S LET ME HAVE IT ANSWERED THE BUSINESSMAN IT HAS
MANY ADVANTAGES K
LOOKED LONG AT HIM HIS FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE
BUSINESSMAN HAD PERHAPS NOT BEEN RIGHT HE HAD EXPERIENCE AS HIS TRIAL
HAD ALREADY LASTED A LONG TIME BUT HE HAD PAID A HEAVY PRICE FOR THIS
EXPERIENCE
K
WAS SUDDENLY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE BUSINESSMAN
ANY LONGER
BRING HIM TO BED THEN HE CALLED OUT TO LENI WHO SEEMED
TO UNDERSTAND HIM
FOR HIMSELF HE WANTED TO GO TO THE LAWYER AND BY
DISMISSING HIM FREE HIMSELF FROM NOT ONLY THE LAWYER BUT ALSO FROM LENI
AND THE BUSINESSMAN
BUT BEFORE HE HAD REACHED THE DOOR THE BUSINESSMAN
SPOKE TO HIM GENTLY
EXCUSE ME SIR HE SAID AND K
LOOKED ROUND
CROSSLY
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE SAID THE BUSINESSMAN
STRETCHING HIS HAND OUT TO K
IMPLORINGLY FROM WHERE HE SAT
YOU WERE
GOING TO TELL ME A SECRET THAT IS TRUE SAID K AS HE GLANCED AT
LENI WHO WAS WATCHING HIM CAREFULLY TO CHECK ON HER
SO LISTEN IT'S
HARDLY A SECRET NOW ANYWAY
I'M GOING TO SEE THE LAWYER NOW TO SACK
HIM HE'S SACKING HIM YELLED THE BUSINESSMAN AND HE JUMPED UP FROM
HIS CHAIR AND RAN AROUND THE KITCHEN WITH HIS ARMS IN THE AIR
HE KEPT
ON SHOUTING HE'S SACKING HIS LAWYER LENI TRIED TO RUSH AT K
BUT
THE BUSINESSMAN GOT IN HER WAY SO THAT SHE SHOVED HIM AWAY WITH HER
FISTS
THEN STILL WITH HER HANDS BALLED INTO FISTS SHE RAN AFTER K
WHO HOWEVER HAD BEEN GIVEN A LONG START
HE WAS ALREADY INSIDE THE
LAWYER'S ROOM BY THE TIME LENI CAUGHT UP WITH HIM
HE HAD ALMOST CLOSED
THE DOOR BEHIND HIMSELF BUT LENI HELD THE DOOR OPEN WITH HER FOOT
GRABBED HIS ARM AND TRIED TO PULL HIM BACK
BUT HE PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON
HER WRIST THAT WITH A SIGH SHE WAS FORCED TO RELEASE HIM
SHE DID NOT
DARE GO INTO THE ROOM STRAIGHT AWAY AND K
LOCKED THE DOOR WITH THE
KEY
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU A VERY LONG TIME SAID THE LAWYER FROM
HIS BED
HE HAD BEEN READING SOMETHING BY THE LIGHT OF A CANDLE BUT NOW
HE LAID IT ONTO THE BEDSIDE TABLE AND PUT HIS GLASSES ON LOOKING AT K
SHARPLY THROUGH THEM
INSTEAD OF APOLOGISING K
SAID I'LL BE LEAVING
AGAIN SOON AS HE HAD NOT APOLOGISED THE LAWYER IGNORED WHAT K
SAID
AND REPLIED I WON'T LET YOU IN THIS LATE AGAIN NEXT TIME I FIND
THAT QUITE ACCEPTABLE SAID K
THE LAWYER LOOKED AT HIM QUIZZICALLY
SIT DOWN HE SAID
AS YOU WISH SAID K DRAWING A CHAIR UP TO THE
BEDSIDE TABLE AND SITTING DOWN
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT YOU LOCKED THE DOOR SAID THE LAWYER
YES
SAID K IT WAS BECAUSE OF LENI HE HAD NO INTENTION OF LETTING
ANYONE OFF LIGHTLY
BUT THE LAWYER ASKED HIM WAS SHE BEING
IMPORTUNATE AGAIN IMPORTUNATE ASKED K
YES SAID THE LAWYER
LAUGHING AS HE DID SO HAD A FIT OF COUGHING AND THEN ONCE IT HAD
PASSED BEGAN TO LAUGH AGAIN
I'M SURE YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED HOW
IMPORTUNATE SHE CAN BE SOMETIMES HE SAID AND PATTED K 'S HAND WHICH
K
HAD RESTED ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE AND WHICH HE NOW SNATCHED BACK
YOU
DON'T ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO IT THEN SAID THE LAWYER WHEN K
WAS
SILENT SO MUCH THE BETTER
OTHERWISE I MIGHT HAVE NEEDED TO APOLOGISE
TO YOU
IT IS A PECULIARITY OF LENI'S
I'VE LONG SINCE FORGIVEN HER
FOR IT AND I WOULDN'T BE TALKING OF IT NOW IF YOU HADN'T LOCKED THE
DOOR JUST NOW
ANYWAY PERHAPS I SHOULD AT LEAST EXPLAIN THIS
PECULIARITY OF HERS TO YOU BUT YOU SEEM RATHER DISTURBED THE WAY
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME AND SO THAT'S WHY I'LL DO IT THIS PECULIARITY OF
HERS CONSISTS IN THIS LENI FINDS MOST OF THE ACCUSED ATTRACTIVE
SHE
ATTACHES HERSELF TO EACH OF THEM LOVES EACH OF THEM EVEN SEEMS TO BE
LOVED BY EACH OF THEM THEN SHE SOMETIMES ENTERTAINS ME BY TELLING ME
ABOUT THEM WHEN I ALLOW HER TO
I AM NOT SO ASTONISHED BY ALL OF THIS
AS YOU SEEM TO BE
IF YOU LOOK AT THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY THE ACCUSED
REALLY CAN BE ATTRACTIVE QUITE OFTEN
BUT THAT IS A REMARKABLE AND TO
SOME EXTENT SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON
BEING INDICTED DOES NOT CAUSE ANY
CLEAR PRECISELY DEFINABLE CHANGE IN A PERSON'S APPEARANCE OF COURSE
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE WITH OTHER LEGAL MATTERS MOST OF THEM REMAIN IN THEIR
USUAL WAY OF LIFE AND IF THEY HAVE A GOOD LAWYER LOOKING AFTER THEM
THE TRIAL DOESN'T GET IN THEIR WAY
BUT THERE ARE NONETHELESS THOSE WHO
HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THESE MATTERS WHO CAN LOOK AT A CROWD HOWEVER BIG
AND TELL YOU WHICH AMONG THEM IS FACING A CHARGE
HOW CAN THEY DO THAT
YOU WILL ASK
MY ANSWER WILL NOT PLEASE YOU
IT IS SIMPLY THAT THOSE
WHO ARE FACING A CHARGE ARE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE
IT CANNOT BE THEIR
GUILT THAT MAKES THEM ATTRACTIVE AS NOT ALL OF THEM ARE GUILTY AT
LEAST THAT'S WHAT I AS A LAWYER HAVE TO SAY AND NOR CAN IT BE THE
PROPER PUNISHMENT THAT HAS MADE THEM ATTRACTIVE AS NOT ALL OF THEM ARE
PUNISHED SO IT CAN ONLY BE THAT THE PROCEEDINGS LEVELLED AGAINST THEM
TAKE SOME KIND OF HOLD ON THEM
WHATEVER THE REASON SOME OF THESE
ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE ARE INDEED VERY ATTRACTIVE
BUT ALL OF THEM ARE
ATTRACTIVE EVEN BLOCK PITIFUL WORM THAT HE IS AS THE LAWYER
FINISHED WHAT HE WAS SAYING K
WAS FULLY IN CONTROL OF HIMSELF HE HAD
EVEN NODDED CONSPICUOUSLY AT HIS LAST FEW WORDS IN ORDER TO CONFIRM TO
HIMSELF THE VIEW HE HAD ALREADY FORMED THAT THE LAWYER WAS TRYING TO
CONFUSE HIM AS HE ALWAYS DID BY MAKING GENERAL AND IRRELEVANT
OBSERVATIONS AND THUS DISTRACT HIM FROM THE MAIN QUESTION OF WHAT HE
WAS ACTUALLY DOING FOR K 'S TRIAL
THE LAWYER MUST HAVE NOTICED THAT K
WAS OFFERING HIM MORE RESISTANCE THAN BEFORE AS HE BECAME SILENT
GIVING K
THE CHANCE TO SPEAK HIMSELF AND THEN AS K
ALSO REMAINED
SILENT HE ASKED DID YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR REASON FOR COMING TO SEE ME
TODAY YES SAID K PUTTING HIS HAND UP TO SLIGHTLY SHADE HIS EYES
FROM THE LIGHT OF THE CANDLE SO THAT HE COULD SEE THE LAWYER BETTER I
WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I'M WITHDRAWING MY REPRESENTATION FROM YOU WITH
IMMEDIATE EFFECT DO I UNDERSTAND YOU RIGHTLY ASKED THE LAWYER AS
HE HALF RAISED HIMSELF IN HIS BED AND SUPPORTED HIMSELF WITH ONE HAND ON
THE PILLOW
I THINK YOU DO SAID K SITTING STIFFLY UPRIGHT AS IF
WAITING IN AMBUSH
WELL WE CAN CERTAINLY DISCUSS THIS PLAN OF YOURS
SAID THE LAWYER AFTER A PAUSE
IT'S NOT A PLAN ANY MORE SAID K
THAT MAY BE SAID THE LAWYER BUT WE STILL MUSTN'T RUSH ANYTHING
HE USED THE WORD 'WE' AS IF HE HAD NO INTENTION OF LETTING K
GO FREE
AND AS IF EVEN IF HE COULD NO LONGER REPRESENT HIM HE COULD STILL AT
LEAST CONTINUE AS HIS ADVISER
NOTHING IS BEING RUSHED SAID K
STANDING SLOWLY UP AND GOING BEHIND HIS CHAIR EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WELL
THOUGHT OUT AND PROBABLY EVEN FOR TOO LONG
THE DECISION IS FINAL
THEN ALLOW ME TO SAY A FEW WORDS SAID THE LAWYER THROWING THE BED
COVER TO ONE SIDE AND SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE BED
HIS NAKED WHITE
HAIRED LEGS SHIVERED IN THE COLD
HE ASKED K
TO PASS HIM A BLANKET
FROM THE COUCH
K
PASSED HIM THE BLANKET AND SAID YOU ARE RUNNING
THE RISK OF CATCHING COLD FOR NO REASON THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE
IMPORTANT ENOUGH SAID THE LAWYER AS HE WRAPPED THE BED COVER AROUND
THE TOP HALF OF HIS BODY AND THEN THE BLANKET AROUND HIS LEGS
YOUR
UNCLE IS MY FRIEND AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME I'VE BECOME FOND OF YOU AS
WELL
I ADMIT THAT QUITE OPENLY
THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT FOR ME TO BE
ASHAMED OF IT WAS VERY UNWELCOME FOR K
TO HEAR THE OLD MAN SPEAK IN
THIS TOUCHING WAY AS IT FORCED HIM TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF MORE FULLY WHICH
HE WOULD RATHER HAVE AVOIDED AND HE WAS AWARE THAT IT ALSO CONFUSED HIM
EVEN THOUGH IT COULD NEVER MAKE HIM REVERSE HIS DECISION
THANK YOU
FOR FEELING SO FRIENDLY TOWARD ME HE SAID AND I ALSO REALISE HOW
DEEPLY INVOLVED YOU'VE BEEN IN MY CASE AS DEEPLY AS POSSIBLE FOR
YOURSELF AND TO BRING AS MUCH ADVANTAGE AS POSSIBLE TO ME
NONETHELESS
I HAVE RECENTLY COME TO THE CONVICTION THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH
I WOULD
NATURALLY NEVER ATTEMPT CONSIDERING THAT YOU ARE SO MUCH OLDER AND MORE
EXPERIENCED THAN I AM TO CONVINCE YOU OF MY OPINION IF I HAVE EVER
UNINTENTIONALLY DONE SO THEN I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS BUT AS YOU HAVE
JUST SAID YOURSELF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH AND IT IS MY
BELIEF THAT MY TRIAL NEEDS TO BE APPROACHED WITH MUCH MORE VIGOUR THAN
HAS SO FAR BEEN THE CASE I SEE SAID THE LAWYER YOU'VE BECOME
IMPATIENT I AM NOT IMPATIENT SAID K WITH SOME IRRITATION AND HE
STOPPED PAYING SO MUCH ATTENTION TO HIS CHOICE OF WORDS
WHEN I FIRST
CAME HERE WITH MY UNCLE YOU PROBABLY NOTICED I WASN'T GREATLY CONCERNED
ABOUT MY CASE AND IF I WASN'T REMINDED OF IT BY FORCE AS IT WERE I
WOULD FORGET ABOUT IT COMPLETELY
BUT MY UNCLE INSISTED I SHOULD ALLOW
YOU TO REPRESENT ME AND I DID SO AS A FAVOUR TO HIM
I COULD HAVE
EXPECTED THE CASE TO BE LESS OF A BURDEN THAN IT HAD BEEN AS THE POINT
OF TAKING ON A LAWYER IS THAT HE SHOULD TAKE ON SOME OF ITS WEIGHT
BUT
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WAS THE OPPOSITE
BEFORE THE TRIAL WAS NEVER
SUCH A WORRY FOR ME AS IT HAS BEEN SINCE YOU'VE BEEN REPRESENTING ME
WHEN I WAS BY MYSELF I NEVER DID ANYTHING ABOUT MY CASE I WAS HARDLY
AWARE OF IT BUT THEN ONCE THERE WAS SOMEONE REPRESENTING ME
EVERYTHING WAS SET FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN I WAS ALWAYS WITHOUT CEASE
WAITING FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING GETTING MORE AND MORE TENSE BUT YOU
DID NOTHING
I DID GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE COURT FROM YOU THAT I
PROBABLY COULD NOT HAVE GOT ANYWHERE ELSE BUT THAT CAN'T BE ENOUGH WHEN
THE TRIAL SUPPOSEDLY IN SECRET IS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO ME
K
HAD PUSHED THE CHAIR AWAY AND STOOD ERECT HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS
OF HIS FROCK COAT
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT IN THE PROCEEDINGS SAID THE
LAWYER QUIETLY AND CALMLY NOTHING NEW OF ANY IMPORTANCE EVER HAPPENS
SO MANY LITIGANTS AT THE SAME STAGE IN THEIR TRIALS HAVE STOOD BEFORE
ME JUST LIKE YOU ARE NOW AND SPOKEN IN THE SAME WAY THEN THESE OTHER
LITIGANTS SAID K HAVE ALL BEEN RIGHT JUST AS I AM
THAT DOES NOT
SHOW THAT I'M NOT I WASN'T TRYING TO SHOW THAT YOU WERE MISTAKEN
SAID THE LAWYER BUT I WANTED TO ADD THAT I EXPECTED BETTER JUDGEMENT
FROM YOU THAN FROM THE OTHERS ESPECIALLY AS I'VE GIVEN YOU MORE INSIGHT
INTO THE WORKINGS OF THE COURT AND MY OWN ACTIVITIES THAN I NORMALLY DO
AND NOW I'M FORCED TO ACCEPT THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE TOO
LITTLE TRUST IN ME
YOU DON'T MAKE IT EASY FOR ME HOW THE LAWYER WAS
HUMILIATING HIMSELF TO K HE WAS SHOWING NO REGARD FOR THE DIGNITY OF
HIS POSITION WHICH ON THIS POINT MUST HAVE BEEN AT ITS MOST SENSITIVE
AND WHY DID HE DO THAT HE DID SEEM TO BE VERY BUSY AS A LAWYER AS WELL
A RICH MAN NEITHER THE LOSS OF INCOME NOR THE LOSS OF A CLIENT COULD
HAVE BEEN OF MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HIM IN THEMSELVES
HE WAS MOREOVER
UNWELL AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THINKING OF PASSING WORK ON TO OTHERS
AND
DESPITE ALL THAT HE HELD ON TIGHTLY TO K
WHY WAS IT SOMETHING
PERSONAL FOR HIS UNCLE'S SAKE OR DID HE REALLY SEE K 'S CASE AS ONE
THAT WAS EXCEPTIONAL AND HOPED TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF WITH
IT EITHER FOR K 'S SAKE OR AND THIS POSSIBILITY COULD NEVER BE
EXCLUDED FOR HIS FRIENDS AT THE COURT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO LEARN
ANYTHING BY LOOKING AT HIM EVEN THOUGH K
WAS SCRUTINIZING HIM QUITE
BRAZENLY
IT COULD ALMOST BE SUPPOSED HE WAS DELIBERATELY HIDING HIS
THOUGHTS AS HE WAITED TO SEE WHAT EFFECT HIS WORDS WOULD HAVE
BUT HE
CLEARLY DEEMED K 'S SILENCE TO BE FAVOURABLE FOR HIMSELF AND HE
CONTINUED YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED THE SIZE OF MY OFFICE BUT THAT I
DON'T EMPLOY ANY STAFF TO HELP ME
THAT USED TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN SEVERAL YOUNG LAWYERS WERE WORKING FOR ME BUT NOW
I WORK ALONE
THIS IS PARTLY TO DO WITH CHANGES IN THE WAY I DO
BUSINESS IN THAT I CONCENTRATE NOWADAYS MORE AND MORE ON MATTERS SUCH
AS YOUR OWN CASE AND PARTLY TO DO WITH THE EVER DEEPER UNDERSTANDING
THAT I ACQUIRE FROM THESE LEGAL MATTERS
I FOUND THAT I COULD NEVER LET
ANYONE ELSE DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF WORK UNLESS I WANTED TO HARM BOTH THE
CLIENT AND THE JOB I HAD TAKEN ON
BUT THE DECISION TO DO ALL THE WORK
MYSELF HAD ITS OBVIOUS RESULT I WAS FORCED TO TURN ALMOST EVERYONE AWAY
WHO ASKED ME TO REPRESENT THEM AND COULD ONLY ACCEPT THOSE I WAS
ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WELL THERE ARE ENOUGH CREATURES WHO LEAP AT
EVERY CRUMB I THROW DOWN AND THEY'RE NOT SO VERY FAR AWAY
MOST
IMPORTANTLY I BECAME ILL FROM OVER WORK
BUT DESPITE THAT I DON'T
REGRET MY DECISION QUITE POSSIBLY I SHOULD HAVE TURNED MORE CASES AWAY
THAN I DID BUT IT DID TURN OUT TO BE ENTIRELY NECESSARY FOR ME TO
DEVOTE MYSELF FULLY TO THE CASES I DID TAKE ON AND THE SUCCESSFUL
RESULTS SHOWED THAT IT WAS WORTH IT
I ONCE READ A DESCRIPTION OF THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPRESENTING SOMEONE IN ORDINARY LEGAL MATTERS AND IN
LEGAL MATTERS OF THIS SORT AND THE WRITER EXPRESSED IT VERY WELL
THIS
IS WHAT HE SAID SOME LAWYERS LEAD THEIR CLIENTS ON A THREAD UNTIL
JUDGEMENT IS PASSED BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO IMMEDIATELY LIFT THEIR
CLIENTS ONTO THEIR SHOULDERS AND CARRY THEM ALL THE WAY TO THE JUDGEMENT
AND BEYOND
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS
BUT IT WAS QUITE TRUE WHEN I SAID I
NEVER REGRET ALL THIS WORK
BUT IF AS IN YOUR CASE THEY ARE SO FULLY
MISUNDERSTOOD WELL THEN I COME VERY CLOSE TO REGRETTING IT ALL THIS
TALKING DID MORE TO MAKE K
IMPATIENT THAN TO PERSUADE HIM
FROM THE
WAY THE LAWYER WAS SPEAKING K
THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR WHAT HE COULD
EXPECT IF HE GAVE IN THE DELAYS AND EXCUSES WOULD BEGIN AGAIN REPORTS
OF HOW THE DOCUMENTS WERE PROGRESSING HOW THE MOOD OF THE COURT
OFFICIALS HAD IMPROVED AS WELL AS ALL THE ENORMOUS DIFFICULTIES IN
SHORT ALL THAT HE HAD HEARD SO MANY TIMES BEFORE WOULD BE BROUGHT OUT
AGAIN EVEN MORE FULLY HE WOULD TRY TO MISLEAD K
WITH HOPES THAT WERE
NEVER SPECIFIED AND TO MAKE HIM SUFFER WITH THREATS THAT WERE NEVER
CLEAR
HE HAD TO PUT A STOP TO THAT SO HE SAID WHAT WILL YOU
UNDERTAKE ON MY BEHALF IF YOU CONTINUE TO REPRESENT ME THE LAWYER
QUIETLY ACCEPTED EVEN THIS INSULTING QUESTION AND ANSWERED I SHOULD
CONTINUE WITH WHAT I'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING FOR YOU THAT'S JUST WHAT
I THOUGHT SAID K AND NOW YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY ANOTHER WORD I
WILL MAKE ONE MORE ATTEMPT SAID THE LAWYER AS IF WHATEVER HAD BEEN
MAKING K
SO ANNOYED WAS AFFECTING HIM TOO
YOU SEE I HAVE THE
IMPRESSION THAT YOU HAVE NOT ONLY MISJUDGED THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE I HAVE
GIVEN YOU BUT ALSO THAT THAT MISJUDGEMENT HAS LED YOU TO BEHAVE IN THIS
WAY YOU SEEM ALTHOUGH YOU ARE THE ACCUSED TO HAVE BEEN TREATED TOO
WELL OR TO PUT IT A BETTER WAY HANDLED WITH NEGLECT WITH APPARENT
NEGLECT
EVEN THAT HAS ITS REASON IT IS OFTEN BETTER TO BE IN CHAINS
THAN TO BE FREE
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU HOW OTHER DEFENDANTS ARE
TREATED PERHAPS YOU WILL SUCCEED IN LEARNING SOMETHING FROM IT
WHAT I
WILL DO IS I WILL CALL BLOCK IN UNLOCK THE DOOR AND SIT DOWN HERE
BESIDE THE BEDSIDE TABLE BE GLAD TO SAID K AND DID AS THE LAWYER
SUGGESTED HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW
BUT TO MAKE SURE
OF HIMSELF FOR ANY EVENT HE ADDED BUT YOU DO REALISE THAT YOU ARE NO
LONGER TO BE MY LAWYER DON'T YOU YES SAID THE LAWYER
BUT YOU
CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR MIND TODAY IF YOU WANT TO HE LAY BACK DOWN IN
THE BED PULLED THE QUILT UP TO HIS CHIN AND TURNED TO FACE THE WALL
THEN HE RANG
LENI APPEARED ALMOST THE MOMENT HE HAD DONE SO
SHE LOOKED
HURRIEDLY AT K
AND THE LAWYER TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
SHE SEEMED TO BE REASSURED BY THE SIGHT OF K
SITTING CALMLY AT THE
LAWYER'S BED
SHE SMILED AND NODDED TO K K
LOOKED BLANKLY BACK AT
HER
FETCH BLOCK SAID THE LAWYER
BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO FETCH
HIM LENI JUST WENT TO THE DOOR AND CALLED OUT BLOCK TO THE LAWYER
THEN PROBABLY BECAUSE THE LAWYER HAD TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND
WAS PAYING NO ATTENTION SHE SLIPPED IN BEHIND K 'S CHAIR
FROM THEN
ON SHE BOTHERED HIM BY LEANING FORWARD OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR OR
ALBEIT VERY TENDERLY AND CAREFULLY SHE WOULD RUN HER HANDS THROUGH HIS
HAIR AND OVER HIS CHEEKS
K
EVENTUALLY TRIED TO STOP HER BY TAKING
HOLD OF ONE HAND AND AFTER SOME RESISTANCE LENI LET HIM KEEP HOLD OF
IT
BLOCK CAME AS SOON AS HE WAS CALLED BUT HE REMAINED STANDING IN
THE DOORWAY AND SEEMED TO BE WONDERING WHETHER HE SHOULD ENTER OR NOT
HE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS AND LOWERED HIS HEAD AS IF LISTENING TO FIND OUT
WHETHER THE ORDER TO ATTEND THE LAWYER WOULD BE REPEATED
K
COULD HAVE
ENCOURAGED TO ENTER BUT HE HAD DECIDED TO MAKE A FINAL BREAK NOT ONLY
WITH THE LAWYER BUT WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS HOME SO HE KEPT HIMSELF
MOTIONLESS
LENI WAS ALSO SILENT
BLOCK NOTICED THAT AT LEAST NO ONE
WAS CHASING HIM AWAY AND ON TIPTOE HE ENTERED THE ROOM HIS FACE WAS
TENSE HIS HANDS WERE CLENCHED BEHIND HIS BACK
HE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN
IN CASE HE NEEDED TO GO BACK AGAIN
K
DID NOT EVEN GLANCE AT HIM HE
LOOKED INSTEAD ONLY AT THE THICK QUILT UNDER WHICH THE LAWYER COULD NOT
BE SEEN AS HE HAD SQUEEZED UP VERY CLOSE TO THE WALL
THEN HIS VOICE
WAS HEARD BLOCK HERE HE ASKED
BLOCK HAD ALREADY CREPT SOME WAY
INTO THE ROOM BUT THIS QUESTION SEEMED TO GIVE HIM FIRST A SHOVE IN THE
BREAST AND THEN ANOTHER IN THE BACK HE SEEMED ABOUT TO FALL BUT
REMAINED STANDING DEEPLY BOWED AND SAID AT YOUR SERVICE SIR
WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE LAWYER YOU'VE COME AT A BAD TIME
WASN'T I SUMMONED ASKED BLOCK MORE TO HIMSELF THAN THE LAWYER
HE
HELD HIS HANDS IN FRONT OF HIMSELF AS PROTECTION AND WOULD HAVE BEEN
READY TO RUN AWAY ANY MOMENT
YOU WERE SUMMONED SAID THE LAWYER
BUT YOU HAVE STILL COME AT A BAD TIME THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED
YOU ALWAYS COME AT A BAD TIME WHEN THE LAWYER STARTED SPEAKING BLOCK
HAD STOPPED LOOKING AT THE BED BUT STARED RATHER INTO ONE OF THE
CORNERS JUST LISTENING AS IF THE LIGHT FROM THE SPEAKER WERE BRIGHTER
THAN BLOCK COULD BEAR TO LOOK AT
BUT IT WAS ALSO DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO
LISTEN AS THE LAWYER WAS SPEAKING INTO THE WALL AND SPEAKING QUICKLY
AND QUIETLY
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO AWAY AGAIN SIR ASKED BLOCK
WELL YOU'RE HERE NOW SAID THE LAWYER
STAY IT WAS AS IF THE
LAWYER HAD NOT DONE AS BLOCK HAD WANTED BUT INSTEAD THREATENED HIM WITH
A STICK AS NOW BLOCK REALLY BEGAN TO SHAKE
I WENT TO SEE SAID THE
LAWYER THE THIRD JUDGE YESTERDAY A FRIEND OF MINE AND SLOWLY BROUGHT
THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THE SUBJECT OF YOU
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
HE SAID OH YES PLEASE SAID BLOCK
THE LAWYER DID NOT ANSWER
IMMEDIATELY SO BLOCK REPEATED HIS REQUEST AND LOWERED HIS HEAD AS IF
ABOUT TO KNEEL DOWN
BUT THEN K
SPOKE TO HIM WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING HE SHOUTED
LENI HAD WANTED TO STOP HIM FROM CALLING OUT
AND SO HE TOOK HOLD OF HER OTHER HAND
IT WAS NOT LOVE THAT MADE HIM
SQUEEZE IT AND HOLD ON TO IT SO TIGHTLY SHE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND TRIED
TO DISENGAGE HER HANDS FROM HIM
BUT BLOCK WAS PUNISHED FOR K 'S
OUTBURST AS THE LAWYER ASKED HIM WHO IS YOUR LAWYER YOU ARE
SIR SAID BLOCK
AND WHO BESIDES ME THE LAWYER ASKED
NO ONE
BESIDES YOU SIR SAID BLOCK
AND LET THERE BE NO ONE BESIDES ME
SAID THE LAWYER
BLOCK FULLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT MEANT HE GLOWERED AT
K SHAKING HIS HEAD VIOLENTLY
IF THESE ACTIONS HAD BEEN TRANSLATED
INTO WORDS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN COARSE INSULTS
K
HAD BEEN FRIENDLY
AND WILLING TO DISCUSS HIS OWN CASE WITH SOMEONE LIKE THIS I WON'T
DISTURB YOU ANY MORE SAID K LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR
YOU CAN
KNEEL DOWN OR CREEP ON ALL FOURS WHATEVER YOU LIKE
I WON'T BOTHER
WITH YOU ANY MORE BUT BLOCK STILL HAD SOME SENSE OF PRIDE AT LEAST
WHERE K
WAS CONCERNED AND HE WENT TOWARDS HIM WAVING HIS FISTS
SHOUTING AS LOUDLY AS HE DARED WHILE THE LAWYER WAS THERE
YOU
SHOULDN'T SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT THAT'S NOT ALLOWED
WHY ARE YOU
INSULTING ME ESPECIALLY HERE IN FRONT OF THE LAWYER WHERE BOTH OF US
YOU AND ME WE'RE ONLY TOLERATED BECAUSE OF HIS CHARITY
YOU'RE NOT A
BETTER PERSON THAN ME YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF SOMETHING TOO YOU'RE
FACING A CHARGE TOO
IF IN SPITE OF THAT YOU'RE STILL A GENTLEMAN
THEN I'M JUST AS MUCH A GENTLEMAN AS YOU ARE IF NOT EVEN MORE SO
AND
I WANT TO BE SPOKEN TO AS A GENTLEMAN ESPECIALLY BY YOU
IF YOU THINK
BEING ALLOWED TO SIT THERE AND QUIETLY LISTEN WHILE I CREEP ON ALL FOURS
AS YOU PUT IT MAKES YOU SOMETHING BETTER THAN ME THEN THERE'S AN OLD
LEGAL SAYING YOU OUGHT TO BEAR IN MIND IF YOU'RE UNDER SUSPICION IT'S
BETTER TO BE MOVING THAN STILL AS IF YOU'RE STILL YOU CAN BE IN THE PAN
OF THE SCALES WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND BE WEIGHED ALONG WITH YOUR SINS
K
SAID NOTHING
HE MERELY LOOKED IN AMAZEMENT AT THIS DISTRACTED
BEING HIS EYES COMPLETELY STILL
HE HAD GONE THROUGH SUCH CHANGES IN
JUST THE LAST FEW HOURS WAS IT THE TRIAL THAT WAS THROWING HIM FROM
SIDE TO SIDE IN THIS WAY AND STOPPED HIM KNOWING WHO WAS FRIEND AND WHO
WAS FOE COULD HE NOT SEE THE LAWYER WAS DELIBERATELY HUMILIATING HIM
AND HAD NO OTHER PURPOSE TODAY THAN TO SHOW OFF HIS POWER TO K AND
PERHAPS EVEN THEREBY SUBJUGATE K BUT IF BLOCK WAS INCAPABLE OF SEEING
THAT OR IF HE SO FEARED THE LAWYER THAT NO SUCH INSIGHT WOULD EVEN BE
OF ANY USE TO HIM HOW WAS IT THAT HE WAS EITHER SO SLY OR SO BOLD AS TO
LIE TO THE LAWYER AND CONCEAL FROM HIM THE FACT THAT HE HAD OTHER
LAWYERS WORKING ON HIS BEHALF AND HOW DID HE DARE TO ATTACK K WHO
COULD BETRAY HIS SECRET ANY TIME HE LIKED BUT HE DARED EVEN MORE THAN
THIS HE WENT TO THE LAWYER'S BED AND BEGAN THERE TO MAKE COMPLAINTS
ABOUT K
DR
HULD SIR HE SAID DID YOU HEAR THE WAY THIS MAN SPOKE
TO ME YOU CAN COUNT THE LENGTH OF HIS TRIAL IN HOURS AND HE WANTS TO
TELL ME WHAT TO DO WHEN I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LEGAL CASE FOR FIVE
YEARS
HE EVEN INSULTS ME
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING BUT HE INSULTS
ME WHEN I AS FAR AS MY WEAK ABILITY ALLOWS WHEN I'VE MADE A CLOSE
STUDY OF HOW TO BEHAVE WITH THE COURT WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO AND WHAT THE
COURT PRACTICES ARE DON'T LET ANYONE BOTHER YOU SAID THE LAWYER
AND DO WHAT SEEMS TO YOU TO BE RIGHT I WILL SAID BLOCK AS IF
SPEAKING TO HIMSELF TO GIVE HIMSELF COURAGE AND WITH A QUICK GLANCE TO
THE SIDE HE KNEELED DOWN CLOSE BESIDE THE BED
I'M KNEELING NOW DR
HULD SIR HE SAID
BUT THE LAWYER REMAINED SILENT
WITH ONE HAND
BLOCK CAREFULLY STROKED THE BED COVER
IN THE SILENCE WHILE HE DID SO
LENI AS SHE FREED HERSELF FROM K 'S HANDS SAID YOU'RE HURTING ME
LET GO OF ME
I'M GOING OVER TO BLOCK SHE WENT OVER TO HIM AND SAT
ON THE EDGE OF THE BED
BLOCK WAS VERY PLEASED AT THIS AND WITH LIVELY
BUT SILENT GESTURES HE IMMEDIATELY URGED HER TO INTERCEDE FOR HIM WITH
THE LAWYER
IT WAS CLEAR THAT HE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BE TOLD
SOMETHING BY THE LAWYER ALTHOUGH PERHAPS ONLY SO THAT HE COULD MAKE USE
OF THE INFORMATION WITH HIS OTHER LAWYERS
LENI PROBABLY KNEW VERY WELL
HOW THE LAWYER COULD BE BROUGHT ROUND POINTED TO HIS HAND AND PURSED
HER LIPS AS IF MAKING A KISS
BLOCK IMMEDIATELY PERFORMED THE HAND KISS
AND AT FURTHER URGING FROM LENI REPEATED IT TWICE MORE
BUT THE
LAWYER CONTINUED TO BE SILENT
THEN LENI LEANT OVER THE LAWYER AS SHE
STRETCHED OUT THE ATTRACTIVE SHAPE OF HER BODY COULD BE SEEN AND BENT
OVER CLOSE TO HIS FACE SHE STROKED HIS LONG WHITE HAIR
THAT NOW
FORCED HIM TO GIVE AN ANSWER
I'M RATHER WARY OF TELLING HIM SAID
THE LAWYER AND HIS HEAD COULD BE SEEN SHAKING SLIGHTLY PERHAPS SO THAT
HE WOULD FEEL THE PRESSURE OF LENI'S HAND BETTER
BLOCK LISTENED
CLOSELY WITH HIS HEAD LOWERED AS IF BY LISTENING HE WERE BREAKING AN
ORDER
WHAT MAKES YOU SO WARY ABOUT IT ASKED LENI
K
HAD THE
FEELING HE WAS LISTENING TO A CONTRIVED DIALOGUE THAT HAD BEEN REPEATED
MANY TIMES THAT WOULD BE REPEATED MANY TIMES MORE AND THAT FOR BLOCK
ALONE IT WOULD NEVER LOSE ITS FRESHNESS
WHAT HAS HIS BEHAVIOUR BEEN
LIKE TODAY ASKED THE LAWYER INSTEAD OF AN ANSWER
BEFORE LENI SAID
ANYTHING SHE LOOKED DOWN AT BLOCK AND WATCHED HIM A SHORT WHILE AS HE
RAISED HIS HANDS TOWARDS HER AND RUBBED THEM TOGETHER IMPLORINGLY
FINALLY SHE GAVE A SERIOUS NOD TURNED BACK TO THE LAWYER AND SAID
HE'S BEEN QUIET AND INDUSTRIOUS THIS WAS AN ELDERLY BUSINESSMAN A
MAN WHOSE BEARD WAS LONG AND HE WAS BEGGING A YOUNG GIRL TO SPEAK ON
HIS BEHALF
EVEN IF THERE WAS SOME PLAN BEHIND WHAT HE DID THERE WAS
NOTHING THAT COULD REINSTATE HIM IN THE EYES OF HIS FELLOW MAN
K
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWYER COULD HAVE THOUGHT THIS PERFORMANCE
WOULD WIN HIM OVER
EVEN IF HE HAD DONE NOTHING EARLIER TO MAKE HIM
WANT TO LEAVE THEN THIS SCENE WOULD HAVE DONE SO
IT WAS ALMOST
HUMILIATING EVEN FOR THE ONLOOKER
SO THESE WERE THE LAWYER'S METHODS
WHICH K
FORTUNATELY HAD NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO FOR LONG TO LET THE CLIENT
FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE WORLD AND LEAVE HIM WITH NOTHING BUT THE HOPE OF
REACHING THE END OF HIS TRIAL BY THIS DELUDED MEANS
HE WAS NO LONGER A
CLIENT HE WAS THE LAWYER'S DOG
IF THE LAWYER HAD ORDERED HIM TO CRAWL
UNDER THE BED AS IF IT WERE A KENNEL AND TO BARK OUT FROM UNDER IT THEN
HE WOULD HAVE DONE SO WITH ENTHUSIASM
K
LISTENED TO ALL OF THIS
TESTING IT AND THINKING IT OVER AS IF HE HAD BEEN GIVEN THE TASK OF
CLOSELY OBSERVING EVERYTHING SPOKEN HERE INFORM A HIGHER OFFICE ABOUT
IT AND WRITE A REPORT
AND WHAT HAS HE BEEN DOING ALL DAY ASKED THE
LAWYER
I KEPT HIM LOCKED IN THE MAID'S ROOM ALL DAY SAID LENI SO
THAT HE WOULDN'T STOP ME DOING MY WORK
THAT'S WHERE HE USUALLY STAYS
FROM TIME TO TIME I LOOKED IN THROUGH THE SPYHOLE TO SEE WHAT HE WAS
DOING AND EACH TIME HE WAS KNEELING ON THE BED AND READING THE PAPERS
YOU GAVE HIM PROPPED UP ON THE WINDOW SILL
THAT MADE A GOOD
IMPRESSION ON ME AS THE WINDOW ONLY OPENS ONTO AN AIR SHAFT AND GIVES
HARDLY ANY LIGHT
IT SHOWED HOW OBEDIENT HE IS THAT HE WAS EVEN READING
IN THOSE CONDITIONS I'M PLEASED TO HEAR IT SAID THE LAWYER
BUT
DID HE UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WAS READING WHILE THIS CONVERSATION WAS
GOING ON BLOCK CONTINUALLY MOVED HIS LIPS AND WAS CLEARLY FORMULATING
THE ANSWERS HE HOPED LENI WOULD GIVE
WELL I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY
CERTAIN ANSWER TO THAT OF COURSE SAID LENI BUT I COULD SEE THAT HE
WAS READING THOROUGHLY
HE SPENT ALL DAY READING THE SAME PAGE RUNNING
HIS FINGER ALONG THE LINES
WHENEVER I LOOKED IN ON HIM HE SIGHED AS IF
THIS READING WAS A LOT OF WORK FOR HIM
I EXPECT THE PAPERS YOU GAVE
HIM WERE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND YES SAID THE LAWYER THEY
CERTAINLY ARE THAT
AND I REALLY DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING OF
THEM
BUT THEY SHOULD AT LEAST GIVE HIM SOME INKLING OF JUST HOW HARD A
STRUGGLE IT IS AND HOW MUCH WORK IT IS FOR ME TO DEFEND HIM
AND WHO AM
I DOING ALL THIS HARD WORK FOR I'M DOING IT IT'S LAUGHABLE EVEN TO
SAY IT I'M DOING IT FOR BLOCK
HE OUGHT TO REALISE WHAT THAT MEANS
TOO
DID HE STUDY WITHOUT A PAUSE ALMOST WITHOUT A PAUSE ANSWERED
LENI
JUST THE ONCE HE ASKED ME FOR A DRINK OF WATER SO I GAVE HIM A
GLASSFUL THROUGH THE WINDOW
THEN AT EIGHT O'CLOCK I LET HIM OUT AND
GAVE HIM SOMETHING TO EAT BLOCK GLANCED SIDEWAYS AT K AS IF HE WERE
BEING PRAISED AND HAD TO IMPRESS K
AS WELL
HE NOW SEEMED MORE
OPTIMISTIC HE MOVED MORE FREELY AND ROCKED BACK AND FORTH ON HIS KNEES
THIS MADE HIS ASTONISHMENT ALL THE MORE OBVIOUS WHEN HE HEARD THE
FOLLOWING WORDS FROM THE LAWYER YOU SPEAK WELL OF HIM SAID THE
LAWYER BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME
YOU SEE THE
JUDGE DID NOT SPEAK WELL OF HIM AT ALL NEITHER ABOUT BLOCK NOR ABOUT
HIS CASE DIDN'T SPEAK WELL OF HIM ASKED LENI
HOW IS THAT
POSSIBLE BLOCK LOOKED AT HER WITH SUCH TENSION HE SEEMED TO THINK
THAT ALTHOUGH THE JUDGE'S WORDS HAD BEEN SPOKEN SO LONG BEFORE SHE WOULD
BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEM IN HIS FAVOUR
NOT AT ALL SAID THE LAWYER
IN FACT HE BECAME QUITE CROSS WHEN I STARTED TO TALK ABOUT BLOCK TO
HIM
'DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT BLOCK HE SAID
'HE IS MY CLIENT SAID
I
'YOU'RE LETTING HIM ABUSE YOU HE SAID
'I DON'T THINK HIS CASE IS
LOST YET SAID I
'YOU'RE LETTING HIM ABUSE YOU HE REPEATED
'I
DON'T THINK SO SAID I
'BLOCK WORKS HARD IN HIS CASE AND ALWAYS KNOWS
WHERE IT STANDS
HE PRACTICALLY LIVES WITH ME SO THAT HE ALWAYS KNOWS
WHAT'S HAPPENING
YOU DON'T ALWAYS FIND SUCH ENTHUSIASM AS THAT
HE'S
NOT VERY PLEASANT PERSONALLY I GRANT YOU HIS MANNERS ARE TERRIBLE AND
HE'S DIRTY BUT AS FAR AS THE TRIAL'S CONCERNED HE'S QUITE IMMACULATE
I SAID IMMACULATE BUT I WAS DELIBERATELY EXAGGERATING
THEN HE SAID
'BLOCK IS SLY THAT'S ALL
HE'S ACCUMULATED PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE AND
KNOWS HOW TO DELAY PROCEEDINGS
BUT THERE'S MORE THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW
THAN HE DOES
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'D SAY IF HE LEARNED HIS TRIAL STILL
HASN'T BEGUN IF YOU TOLD HIM THEY HAVEN'T EVEN RUNG THE BELL TO
ANNOUNCE THE START OF PROCEEDINGS ALRIGHT BLOCK ALRIGHT SAID THE
LAWYER AS AT THESE WORDS BLOCK HAD BEGUN TO RAISE HIMSELF ON HIS
TREMBLING KNEES AND CLEARLY WANTED TO PLEAD FOR SOME EXPLANATION
IT
WAS THE FIRST TIME THE LAWYER HAD SPOKEN ANY CLEAR WORDS DIRECTLY TO
BLOCK
HE LOOKED DOWN WITH HIS TIRED EYES HALF BLANKLY AND HALF AT
BLOCK WHO SLOWLY SANK BACK DOWN ON HIS KNEES UNDER THIS GAZE
WHAT
THE JUDGE SAID HAS NO MEANING FOR YOU SAID THE LAWYER
YOU NEEDN'T
BE FRIGHTENED AT EVERY WORD
IF YOU DO IT AGAIN I WON'T TELL YOU
ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO START A SENTENCE WITHOUT YOU
LOOKING AT ME AS IF YOU WERE RECEIVING YOUR FINAL JUDGEMENT
YOU SHOULD
BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF HERE IN FRONT OF MY CLIENT AND YOU'RE
DESTROYING THE TRUST HE HAS FOR ME
JUST WHAT IS IT YOU WANT YOU'RE
STILL ALIVE YOU'RE STILL UNDER MY PROTECTION
THERE'S NO POINT IN
WORRYING SOMEWHERE YOU'VE READ THAT THE FINAL JUDGEMENT CAN OFTEN COME
WITHOUT WARNING FROM ANYONE AT ANY TIME
AND IN THE RIGHT
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT'S BASICALLY TRUE BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT I DISLIKE
YOUR ANXIETY AND FEAR AND SEE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE TRUST IN ME YOU
SHOULD HAVE
NOW WHAT HAVE I JUST SAID I REPEATED SOMETHING SAID BY
ONE OF THE JUDGES
YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SO MANY VARIOUS OPINIONS
ABOUT THE PROCEDURE THAT THEY FORM INTO A GREAT BIG PILE AND NOBODY CAN
MAKE ANY SENSE OF THEM
THIS JUDGE FOR INSTANCE SEES PROCEEDINGS AS
STARTING AT A DIFFERENT POINT FROM WHERE I DO
A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
NOTHING MORE
AT A CERTAIN STAGE IN THE PROCEEDINGS TRADITION HAS IT
THAT A SIGN IS GIVEN BY RINGING A BELL
THIS JUDGE SEES THAT AS THE
POINT AT WHICH PROCEEDINGS BEGIN
I CAN'T SET OUT ALL THE OPINIONS
OPPOSED TO THAT VIEW HERE AND YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT ANYWAY
SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO DISAGREE WITH HIM
EMBARRASSED BLOCK RAN HIS FINGERS THROUGH THE PILE OF THE CARPET HIS
ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT THE JUDGE HAD SAID HAD LET HIM FORGET HIS INFERIOR
STATUS TOWARDS THE LAWYER FOR A WHILE HE THOUGHT ONLY ABOUT HIMSELF AND
TURNED THE JUDGES WORDS ROUND TO EXAMINE THEM FROM ALL SIDES
BLOCK
SAID LENI AS IF REPRIMANDING HIM AND TAKING HOLD OF THE COLLAR OF HIS
COAT PULLED HIM UP SLIGHTLY HIGHER
LEAVE THE CARPET ALONE AND LISTEN
TO WHAT THE LAWYER IS SAYING
THIS CHAPTER WAS LEFT UNFINISHED
CHAPTER NINE
IN THE CATHEDRAL
A VERY IMPORTANT ITALIAN BUSINESS CONTACT OF THE BANK HAD COME TO
VISIT THE CITY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND K
WAS GIVEN THE TASK OF SHOWING
HIM SOME OF ITS CULTURAL SIGHTS
AT ANY OTHER TIME HE WOULD HAVE SEEN
THIS JOB AS AN HONOUR BUT NOW WHEN HE WAS FINDING IT HARD EVEN TO
MAINTAIN HIS CURRENT POSITION IN THE BANK HE ACCEPTED IT ONLY WITH
RELUCTANCE
EVERY HOUR THAT HE COULD NOT BE IN THE OFFICE WAS A CAUSE
OF CONCERN FOR HIM HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO MAKE USE OF HIS TIME IN THE
OFFICE ANYTHING LIKE AS WELL AS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HE SPENT MANY HOURS
MERELY PRETENDING TO DO IMPORTANT WORK BUT THAT ONLY INCREASED HIS
ANXIETY ABOUT NOT BEING IN THE OFFICE
THEN HE SOMETIMES THOUGHT HE SAW
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHO WAS ALWAYS WATCHING COME INTO K 'S OFFICE SIT
AT HIS DESK LOOK THROUGH HIS PAPERS RECEIVE CLIENTS WHO HAD ALMOST
BECOME OLD FRIENDS OF K AND LURE THEM AWAY FROM HIM PERHAPS HE EVEN
DISCOVERED MISTAKES MISTAKES THAT SEEMED TO THREATEN K
FROM A THOUSAND
DIRECTIONS WHEN HE WAS AT WORK NOW AND WHICH HE COULD NO LONGER AVOID
SO NOW IF HE WAS EVER ASKED TO LEAVE THE OFFICE ON BUSINESS OR EVEN
NEEDED TO MAKE A SHORT BUSINESS TRIP HOWEVER MUCH AN HONOUR IT SEEMED
AND TASKS OF THIS SORT HAPPENED TO HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY RECENTLY
THERE WAS ALWAYS THE SUSPICION THAT THEY WANTED TO GET HIM OUT OF HIS
OFFICE FOR A WHILE AND CHECK HIS WORK OR AT LEAST THE IDEA THAT THEY
THOUGHT HE WAS DISPENSABLE
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO
TURN DOWN MOST OF THESE JOBS BUT HE DID NOT DARE TO DO SO BECAUSE IF
HIS FEARS HAD THE SLIGHTEST FOUNDATION TURNING THE JOBS DOWN WOULD HAVE
BEEN AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THEM
FOR THIS REASON HE NEVER DEMURRED
FROM ACCEPTING THEM AND EVEN WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO GO ON A TIRING
BUSINESS TRIP LASTING TWO DAYS HE SAID NOTHING ABOUT HAVING TO GO OUT IN
THE RAINY AUTUMN WEATHER WHEN HE HAD A SEVERE CHILL JUST IN ORDER TO
AVOID THE RISK OF NOT BEING ASKED TO GO
WHEN WITH A RAGING HEADACHE
HE ARRIVED BACK FROM THIS TRIP HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN CHOSEN TO
ACCOMPANY THE ITALIAN BUSINESS CONTACT THE FOLLOWING DAY
THE
TEMPTATION FOR ONCE TO TURN THE JOB DOWN WAS VERY GREAT ESPECIALLY AS
IT HAD NO DIRECT CONNECTION WITH BUSINESS BUT THERE WAS NO DENYING THAT
SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS TOWARDS THIS BUSINESS CONTACT WERE IN THEMSELVES
IMPORTANT ENOUGH ONLY NOT FOR K WHO KNEW QUITE WELL THAT HE NEEDED
SOME SUCCESSES AT WORK IF HE WAS TO MAINTAIN HIS POSITION THERE AND
THAT IF HE FAILED IN THAT IT WOULD NOT HELP HIM EVEN IF THIS ITALIAN
SOMEHOW FOUND HIM QUITE CHARMING HE DID NOT WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM HIS
WORKPLACE FOR EVEN ONE DAY AS THE FEAR OF NOT BEING ALLOWED BACK IN WAS
TOO GREAT HE KNEW FULL WELL THAT THE FEAR WAS EXAGGERATED BUT IT STILL
MADE HIM ANXIOUS
HOWEVER IN THIS CASE IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
THINK OF AN ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ITALIAN WAS NOT GREAT
BUT STILL GOOD ENOUGH THE DECIDING FACTOR WAS THAT K
HAD EARLIER KNOWN
A LITTLE ABOUT ART HISTORY AND THIS HAD BECOME WIDELY KNOWN AROUND THE
BANK IN EXTREMELY EXAGGERATED FORM AND THAT K
HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE
SOCIETY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF CITY MONUMENTS ALBEIT ONLY FOR BUSINESS
REASONS
IT WAS SAID THAT THIS ITALIAN WAS AN ART LOVER SO THE CHOICE
OF K
TO ACCOMPANY HIM WAS A MATTER OF COURSE
IT WAS A VERY RAINY AND STORMY MORNING WHEN K IN A FOUL TEMPER
AT THE THOUGHT OF THE DAY AHEAD OF HIM ARRIVED EARLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK
IN THE OFFICE SO THAT HE COULD AT LEAST DO SOME WORK BEFORE HIS VISITOR
WOULD PREVENT HIM
HE HAD SPENT HALF THE NIGHT STUDYING A BOOK OF
ITALIAN GRAMMAR SO THAT HE WOULD BE SOMEWHAT PREPARED AND WAS VERY
TIRED HIS DESK WAS LESS ATTRACTIVE TO HIM THAN THE WINDOW WHERE HE HAD
SPENT FAR TOO MUCH TIME SITTING OF LATE BUT HE RESISTED THE TEMPTATION
AND SAT DOWN TO HIS WORK
UNFORTUNATELY JUST THEN THE SERVITOR CAME IN
AND REPORTED THAT THE DIRECTOR HAD SENT HIM TO SEE WHETHER THE CHIEF
CLERK WAS ALREADY IN HIS OFFICE IF HE WAS THEN WOULD HE PLEASE BE SO
KIND AS TO COME TO HIS RECEPTION ROOM AS THE GENTLEMAN FROM ITALY WAS
ALREADY THERE
I'LL COME STRAIGHT AWAY SAID K
HE PUT A SMALL
DICTIONARY IN HIS POCKET TOOK A GUIDE TO THE CITY'S TOURIST SITES UNDER
HIS ARM THAT HE HAD COMPILED FOR STRANGERS AND WENT THROUGH THE DEPUTY
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE INTO THAT OF THE DIRECTOR
HE WAS GLAD HE HAD COME
INTO THE OFFICE SO EARLY AND WAS ABLE TO BE OF SERVICE IMMEDIATELY
NOBODY COULD SERIOUSLY HAVE EXPECTED THAT OF HIM
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR'S
OFFICE WAS OF COURSE STILL AS EMPTY AS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THE
SERVITOR HAD PROBABLY BEEN ASKED TO SUMMON HIM TOO BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
AS K
ENTERED THE RECEPTION ROOM TWO MEN STOOD UP FROM THE DEEP
ARMCHAIRS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SITTING
THE DIRECTOR GAVE HIM A FRIENDLY
SMILE HE WAS CLEARLY VERY GLAD THAT K
WAS THERE HE IMMEDIATELY
INTRODUCED HIM TO THE ITALIAN WHO SHOOK K 'S HAND VIGOROUSLY AND JOKED
THAT SOMEBODY WAS AN EARLY RISER
K
DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHOM HE
HAD IN MIND IT WAS MOREOVER AN ODD EXPRESSION TO USE AND IT TOOK K
A
LITTLE WHILE TO GUESS ITS MEANING
HE REPLIED WITH A FEW BLAND PHRASES
WHICH THE ITALIAN RECEIVED ONCE MORE WITH A LAUGH PASSING HIS HAND
NERVOUSLY AND REPEATEDLY OVER HIS BLUE GREY BUSHY MOUSTACHE
THIS
MOUSTACHE WAS OBVIOUSLY PERFUMED IT WAS ALMOST TEMPTING TO COME CLOSE
TO IT AND SNIFF
WHEN THEY HAD ALL SAT DOWN AND BEGUN A LIGHT
PRELIMINARY CONVERSATION K
WAS DISCONCERTED TO NOTICE THAT HE
UNDERSTOOD NO MORE THAN FRAGMENTS OF WHAT THE ITALIAN SAID
WHEN HE
SPOKE VERY CALMLY HE UNDERSTOOD ALMOST EVERYTHING BUT THAT WAS VERY
INFREQUENT MOSTLY THE WORDS GUSHED FROM HIS MOUTH AND HE SEEMED TO BE
ENJOYING HIMSELF SO MUCH HIS HEAD SHOOK
WHEN HE WAS TALKING IN THIS
WAY HIS SPEECH WAS USUALLY WRAPPED UP IN SOME KIND OF DIALECT WHICH
SEEMED TO K
TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ITALIAN BUT WHICH THE DIRECTOR
NOT ONLY UNDERSTOOD BUT ALSO SPOKE ALTHOUGH K
OUGHT TO HAVE FORESEEN
THIS AS THE ITALIAN CAME FROM THE SOUTH OF HIS COUNTRY WHERE THE
DIRECTOR HAD ALSO SPENT SEVERAL YEARS
WHATEVER THE CAUSE K
REALISED
THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE ITALIAN HAD BEEN LARGELY
TAKEN FROM HIM EVEN HIS FRENCH WAS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND HIS
MOUSTACHE CONCEALED THE MOVEMENTS OF HIS LIPS WHICH MIGHT HAVE OFFERED
SOME HELP IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE SAID
K
BEGAN TO ANTICIPATE MANY
DIFFICULTIES HE GAVE UP TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ITALIAN SAID
WITH THE DIRECTOR THERE WHO COULD UNDERSTAND HIM SO EASILY IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN POINTLESS EFFORT AND FOR THE TIME BEING DID NO MORE THAN
SCOWL AT THE ITALIAN AS HE RELAXED SITTING DEEP BUT COMFORTABLE IN THE
ARMCHAIR AS HE FREQUENTLY PULLED AT HIS SHORT SHARPLY TAILORED JACKET
AND AT ONE TIME LIFTED HIS ARMS IN THE AIR AND MOVED HIS HANDS FREELY TO
TRY AND DEPICT SOMETHING THAT K
COULD NOT GRASP EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
LEANING FORWARD AND DID NOT LET THE HANDS OUT OF HIS SIGHT
K
HAD
NOTHING TO OCCUPY HIMSELF BUT MECHANICALLY WATCH THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN
THE TWO MEN AND HIS TIREDNESS FINALLY MADE ITSELF FELT TO HIS ALARM
ALTHOUGH FORTUNATELY IN GOOD TIME HE ONCE CAUGHT HIMSELF NEARLY GETTING
UP TURNING ROUND AND LEAVING
EVENTUALLY THE ITALIAN LOOKED AT THE
CLOCK AND JUMPED UP
AFTER TAKING HIS LEAVE FROM THE DIRECTOR HE TURNED
TO K PRESSING HIMSELF SO CLOSE TO HIM THAT K
HAD TO PUSH HIS CHAIR
BACK JUST SO THAT HE COULD MOVE
THE DIRECTOR HAD NO DOUBT SEEN THE
ANXIETY IN K 'S EYES AS HE TRIED TO COPE WITH THIS DIALECT OF ITALIAN
HE JOINED IN WITH THIS CONVERSATION IN A WAY THAT WAS SO ADROIT AND
UNOBTRUSIVE THAT HE SEEMED TO BE ADDING NO MORE THAN MINOR COMMENTS
WHEREAS IN FACT HE WAS SWIFTLY AND PATIENTLY BREAKING INTO WHAT THE
ITALIAN SAID SO THAT K
COULD UNDERSTAND
K
LEARNED IN THIS WAY THAT
THE ITALIAN FIRST HAD A FEW BUSINESS MATTERS TO SETTLE THAT HE
UNFORTUNATELY HAD ONLY A LITTLE TIME AT HIS DISPOSAL THAT HE CERTAINLY
DID NOT INTEND TO RUSH ROUND TO SEE EVERY MONUMENT IN THE CITY THAT HE
WOULD MUCH RATHER AT LEAST AS LONG AS K
WOULD AGREE IT WAS ENTIRELY
HIS DECISION JUST SEE THE CATHEDRAL AND TO DO SO THOROUGHLY
HE WAS
EXTREMELY PLEASED TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOMEONE WHO WAS SO LEARNED AND SO
PLEASANT BY THIS HE MEANT K WHO WAS OCCUPIED NOT WITH LISTENING TO
THE ITALIAN BUT THE DIRECTOR AND ASKED IF HE WOULD BE SO KIND IF THE
TIME WAS SUITABLE TO MEET HIM IN THE CATHEDRAL IN TWO HOURS' TIME AT
ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK
HE HOPED HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO BE THERE AT
THAT TIME
K
MADE AN APPROPRIATE REPLY THE ITALIAN SHOOK FIRST THE
DIRECTOR'S HAND AND THEN K 'S THEN THE DIRECTOR'S AGAIN AND WENT TO THE
DOOR HALF TURNED TO THE TWO MEN WHO FOLLOWED HIM AND CONTINUING TO TALK
WITHOUT A BREAK
K
REMAINED TOGETHER WITH THE DIRECTOR FOR A SHORT
WHILE ALTHOUGH THE DIRECTOR LOOKED ESPECIALLY UNHAPPY TODAY
HE
THOUGHT HE NEEDED TO APOLOGISE TO K
FOR SOMETHING AND TOLD HIM THEY
WERE STANDING INTIMATELY CLOSE TOGETHER HE HAD THOUGHT AT FIRST HE
WOULD ACCOMPANY THE ITALIAN HIMSELF BUT THEN HE GAVE NO MORE PRECISE
REASON THAN THIS THEN HE DECIDED IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SEND K
WITH
HIM
HE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ITALIAN
AT FIRST HE WOULD BE ABLE TO VERY SOON AND EVEN IF HE REALLY COULD NOT
UNDERSTAND VERY MUCH HE SAID IT WAS NOT SO BAD AS IT WAS REALLY NOT SO
IMPORTANT FOR THE ITALIAN TO BE UNDERSTOOD
AND ANYWAY K 'S KNOWLEDGE
OF ITALIAN WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD THE DIRECTOR WAS SURE HE WOULD GET BY
VERY WELL
AND WITH THAT IT WAS TIME FOR K
TO GO
HE SPENT THE TIME
STILL REMAINING TO HIM WITH A DICTIONARY COPYING OUT OBSCURE WORDS HE
WOULD NEED TO GUIDE THE ITALIAN ROUND THE CATHEDRAL
IT WAS AN
EXTREMELY IRKSOME TASK SERVITORS BROUGHT HIM THE MAIL BANK STAFF CAME
WITH VARIOUS QUERIES AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT K
WAS BUSY STOOD BY THE
DOOR AND DID NOT GO AWAY UNTIL HE HAD LISTENED TO THEM THE DEPUTY
DIRECTOR DID NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISTURB K
AND CAME IN
FREQUENTLY TOOK THE DICTIONARY FROM HIS HAND AND FLICKED THROUGH ITS
PAGES CLEARLY FOR NO PURPOSE WHEN THE DOOR TO THE ANTE ROOM OPENED
EVEN CLIENTS WOULD APPEAR FROM THE HALF DARKNESS AND BOW TIMIDLY TO HIM
THEY WANTED TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION BUT WERE NOT SURE WHETHER HE HAD
SEEN THEM ALL THIS ACTIVITY WAS CIRCLING AROUND K
WITH HIM AT ITS
CENTRE WHILE HE COMPILED THE LIST OF WORDS HE WOULD NEED THEN LOOKED
THEM UP IN THE DICTIONARY THEN WROTE THEM OUT THEN PRACTISED THEIR
PRONUNCIATION AND FINALLY TRIED TO LEARN THEM BY HEART
THE GOOD
INTENTIONS HE HAD HAD EARLIER THOUGH SEEMED TO HAVE LEFT HIM
COMPLETELY IT WAS THE ITALIAN WHO HAD CAUSED HIM ALL THIS EFFORT AND
SOMETIMES HE BECAME SO ANGRY WITH HIM THAT HE BURIED THE DICTIONARY
UNDER SOME PAPERS FIRMLY INTENDING TO DO NO MORE PREPARATION BUT THEN
HE REALISED HE COULD NOT WALK UP AND DOWN IN THE CATHEDRAL WITH THE
ITALIAN WITHOUT SAYING A WORD SO IN AN EVEN GREATER RAGE HE
PULLED THE DICTIONARY BACK OUT AGAIN
AT EXACTLY HALF PAST NINE JUST WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE THERE
WAS A TELEPHONE CALL FOR HIM LENI WISHED HIM GOOD MORNING AND ASKED HOW
HE WAS K
THANKED HER HURRIEDLY AND TOLD HER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM
TO TALK NOW AS HE HAD TO GO TO THE CATHEDRAL
TO THE CATHEDRAL ASKED
LENI
YES TO THE CATHEDRAL WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE
CATHEDRAL FOR SAID LENI
K
TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT TO HER BRIEFLY BUT
HE HAD HARDLY BEGUN WHEN LENI SUDDENLY SAID THEY'RE HARASSING YOU
ONE THING THAT K
COULD NOT BEAR WAS PITY THAT HE HAD NOT WANTED OR
EXPECTED HE TOOK HIS LEAVE OF HER WITH TWO WORDS BUT AS HE PUT THE
RECEIVER BACK IN ITS PLACE HE SAID HALF TO HIMSELF AND HALF TO THE GIRL
ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE WHO COULD NO LONGER HEAR HIM YES THEY'RE
HARASSING ME
BY NOW THE TIME WAS LATE AND THERE WAS ALMOST A DANGER HE WOULD
NOT BE ON TIME
HE TOOK A TAXI TO THE CATHEDRAL AT THE LAST MOMENT HE
HAD REMEMBERED THE ALBUM THAT HE HAD HAD NO OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE TO THE
ITALIAN EARLIER AND SO TOOK IT WITH HIM NOW
HE HELD IT ON HIS KNEES
AND DRUMMED IMPATIENTLY ON IT DURING THE WHOLE JOURNEY
THE RAIN HAD
EASED OFF SLIGHTLY BUT IT WAS STILL DAMP CHILLY AND DARK IT WOULD BE
DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYTHING IN THE CATHEDRAL BUT STANDING ABOUT ON COLD
FLAGSTONES MIGHT WELL MAKE K 'S CHILL MUCH WORSE
THE SQUARE IN FRONT
OF THE CATHEDRAL WAS QUITE EMPTY K
REMEMBERED HOW EVEN AS A SMALL
CHILD HE HAD NOTICED THAT NEARLY ALL THE HOUSES IN THIS NARROW SQUARE
HAD THE CURTAINS AT THEIR WINDOWS CLOSED MOST OF THE TIME ALTHOUGH
TODAY WITH THE WEATHER LIKE THIS IT WAS MORE UNDERSTANDABLE
THE
CATHEDRAL ALSO SEEMED QUITE EMPTY OF COURSE NO ONE WOULD THINK OF GOING
THERE ON A DAY LIKE THIS
K
HURRIED ALONG BOTH THE SIDE NAVES BUT SAW
NO ONE BUT AN OLD WOMAN WHO WRAPPED UP IN A WARM SHAWL WAS KNEELING AT
A PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN MARY AND STARING UP AT IT
THEN IN THE
DISTANCE HE SAW A CHURCH OFFICIAL WHO LIMPED AWAY THROUGH A DOORWAY IN
THE WALL
K
HAD ARRIVED ON TIME IT HAD STRUCK TEN JUST AS HE WAS
ENTERING THE BUILDING BUT THE ITALIAN STILL WAS NOT THERE
K
WENT
BACK TO THE MAIN ENTRANCE STOOD THERE INDECISIVELY FOR A WHILE AND
THEN WALKED ROUND THE CATHEDRAL IN THE RAIN IN CASE THE ITALIAN WAS
WAITING AT ANOTHER ENTRANCE
HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
COULD THE
DIRECTOR HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT TIME THEY HAD AGREED ON HOW COULD
ANYONE UNDERSTAND SOMEONE LIKE THAT PROPERLY ANYWAY WHATEVER HAD
HAPPENED K
WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIM FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR
AS
HE WAS TIRED HE WANTED TO SIT DOWN HE WENT BACK INSIDE THE CATHEDRAL
HE FOUND SOMETHING LIKE A SMALL CARPET ON ONE OF THE STEPS HE MOVED IT
WITH HIS FOOT TO A NEARBY PEW WRAPPED HIMSELF UP TIGHTER IN HIS COAT
PUT THE COLLAR UP AND SAT DOWN
TO PASS THE TIME HE OPENED THE ALBUM
AND FLICKED THROUGH THE PAGES A LITTLE BUT SOON HAD TO GIVE UP AS IT
BECAME SO DARK THAT WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE COULD HARDLY MAKE OUT ANYTHING
IN THE SIDE NAVE NEXT TO HIM
IN THE DISTANCE THERE WAS A LARGE TRIANGLE OF CANDLES FLICKERING
ON THE MAIN ALTAR K
WAS NOT CERTAIN WHETHER HE HAD SEEN THEM EARLIER
PERHAPS THEY HAD ONLY JUST BEEN LIT
CHURCH STAFF CREEP SILENTLY AS
PART OF THEIR JOB YOU DON'T NOTICE THEM
WHEN K
HAPPENED TO TURN
ROUND HE ALSO SAW A TALL STOUT CANDLE ATTACHED TO A COLUMN NOT FAR
BEHIND HIM
IT WAS ALL VERY PRETTY BUT TOTALLY INADEQUATE TO
ILLUMINATE THE PICTURES WHICH WERE USUALLY LEFT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE
SIDE ALTARS AND SEEMED TO MAKE THE DARKNESS ALL THE DEEPER
IT WAS
DISCOURTEOUS OF THE ITALIAN NOT TO COME BUT IT WAS ALSO SENSIBLE OF HIM
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO SEE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO CONTENT
THEMSELVES WITH SEEKING OUT A FEW PICTURES WITH K 'S ELECTRIC POCKET
TORCH AND LOOKING AT THEM ONE SMALL PART AT A TIME
K
WENT OVER TO A
NEARBY SIDE CHAPEL TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD HAVE HOPED FOR HE WENT UP A
FEW STEPS TO A LOW MARBLE RAILING AND LEANT OVER IT TO LOOK AT THE ALTAR
PICTURE BY THE LIGHT OF HIS TORCH
THE ETERNAL LIGHT HUNG DISTURBINGLY
IN FRONT OF IT
THE FIRST THING THAT K
PARTLY SAW AND PARTLY GUESSED
AT WAS A LARGE KNIGHT IN ARMOUR WHO WAS SHOWN AT THE FAR EDGE OF THE
PAINTING
HE WAS LEANING ON HIS SWORD THAT HE HAD STUCK INTO THE NAKED
GROUND IN FRONT OF HIM WHERE ONLY A FEW BLADES OF GRASS GREW HERE AND
THERE
HE SEEMED TO BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT WAS
BEING PLAYED OUT IN FRONT OF HIM
IT WAS ASTONISHING TO SEE HOW HE
STOOD THERE WITHOUT GOING ANY CLOSER
PERHAPS IT WAS HIS JOB TO STAND
GUARD
IT WAS A LONG TIME SINCE K
HAD LOOKED AT ANY PICTURES AND HE
STUDIED THE KNIGHT FOR A LONG TIME EVEN THOUGH HE HAD CONTINUALLY TO
BLINK AS HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BEAR THE GREEN LIGHT OF HIS TORCH
THEN WHEN HE MOVED THE LIGHT TO THE OTHER PARTS OF THE PICTURE HE FOUND
AN INTERMENT OF CHRIST SHOWN IN THE USUAL WAY IT WAS ALSO A
COMPARATIVELY NEW PAINTING
HE PUT HIS TORCH AWAY AND WENT BACK TO HIS
PLACE
THERE SEEMED TO BE NO POINT IN WAITING FOR THE ITALIAN ANY LONGER
BUT OUTSIDE IT WAS CERTAINLY RAINING HEAVILY AND AS IT WAS NOT SO COLD
IN THE CATHEDRAL AS K
HAD EXPECTED HE DECIDED TO STAY THERE FOR THE
TIME BEING
CLOSE BY HIM WAS THE GREAT PULPIT THERE WERE TWO PLAIN
GOLDEN CROSSES ATTACHED TO ITS LITTLE ROUND ROOF WHICH WERE LYING ALMOST
FLAT AND WHOSE TIPS CROSSED OVER EACH OTHER
THE OUTSIDE OF THE
PULPIT'S BALUSTRADE WAS COVERED IN GREEN FOLIAGE WHICH CONTINUED DOWN TO
THE COLUMN SUPPORTING IT LITTLE ANGELS COULD BE SEEN AMONG THE LEAVES
SOME OF THEM LIVELY AND SOME OF THEM STILL
K
WALKED UP TO THE PULPIT
AND EXAMINED IT FROM ALL SIDES ITS STONEWORK HAD BEEN SCULPTED WITH
GREAT CARE IT SEEMED AS IF THE FOLIAGE HAD TRAPPED A DEEP DARKNESS
BETWEEN AND BEHIND ITS LEAVES AND HELD IT THERE PRISONER K
LAY HIS
HAND IN ONE OF THESE GAPS AND CAUTIOUSLY FELT THE STONE UNTIL THEN HE
HAD BEEN TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THIS PULPIT'S EXISTENCE
THEN K
HAPPENED
TO NOTICE ONE OF THE CHURCH STAFF STANDING BEHIND THE NEXT ROW OF PEWS
HE WORE A LOOSE CREASED BLACK CASSOCK HE HELD A SNUFF BOX IN HIS LEFT
HAND AND HE WAS WATCHING K
NOW WHAT DOES HE WANT THOUGHT K
DO I
SEEM SUSPICIOUS TO HIM DOES HE WANT A TIP BUT WHEN THE MAN IN THE
CASSOCK SAW THAT K
HAD NOTICED HIM HE RAISED HIS RIGHT HAND A PINCH OF
SNUFF STILL HELD BETWEEN TWO FINGERS AND POINTED IN SOME VAGUE
DIRECTION
IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BEHAVIOUR
MEANT K
WAITED A WHILE LONGER BUT THE MAN IN THE CASSOCK DID NOT STOP
GESTURING WITH HIS HAND AND EVEN AUGMENTED IT BY NODDING HIS HEAD
NOW
WHAT DOES HE WANT ASKED K
QUIETLY HE DID NOT DARE CALL OUT LOUD
HERE BUT THEN HE DREW OUT HIS PURSE AND PUSHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE
NEAREST PEWS TO REACH THE MAN
HE HOWEVER IMMEDIATELY GESTURED TO
TURN DOWN THIS OFFER SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND LIMPED AWAY
AS A
CHILD K
HAD IMITATED RIDING ON A HORSE WITH THE SAME SORT OF MOVEMENT
AS THIS LIMP
THIS OLD MAN IS LIKE A CHILD THOUGHT K HE DOESN'T
HAVE THE SENSE FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN SERVING IN A CHURCH
LOOK AT THE
WAY HE STOPS WHEN I STOP AND HOW HE WAITS TO SEE WHETHER I'LL
CONTINUE WITH A SMILE K
FOLLOWED THE OLD MAN ALL THE WAY UP THE
SIDE NAVE AND ALMOST AS FAR AS THE MAIN ALTAR ALL THIS TIME THE OLD MAN
CONTINUED TO POINT AT SOMETHING BUT K
DELIBERATELY AVOIDED LOOKING
ROUND HE WAS ONLY POINTING IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR K
TO FOLLOW
HIM
EVENTUALLY K
DID STOP FOLLOWING HE DID NOT WANT TO WORRY THE
OLD MAN TOO MUCH AND HE ALSO DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY
COMPLETELY IN CASE THE ITALIAN TURNED UP AFTER ALL
WHEN HE ENTERED THE CENTRAL NAVE TO GO BACK TO WHERE HE HAD LEFT
THE ALBUM HE NOTICED A SMALL SECONDARY PULPIT ON A COLUMN ALMOST NEXT
TO THE STALLS BY THE ALTAR WHERE THE CHOIR SAT
IT WAS VERY SIMPLE
MADE OF PLAIN WHITE STONE AND SO SMALL THAT FROM A DISTANCE IT LOOKED
LIKE AN EMPTY NICHE WHERE THE STATUE OF A SAINT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
IT
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PRIEST TO TAKE A FULL STEP
BACK FROM THE BALUSTRADE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DECORATION ON IT
THE TOP OF THE PULPIT CURVED IN EXCEPTIONALLY LOW SO THAT A MAN OF
AVERAGE HEIGHT WOULD NOT BE ABLE STAND UPRIGHT AND WOULD HAVE TO REMAIN
BENT FORWARD OVER THE BALUSTRADE
IN ALL IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN
INTENDED TO MAKE THE PRIEST SUFFER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY
THIS PULPIT WOULD BE NEEDED AS THERE WERE ALSO THE OTHER ONES AVAILABLE
WHICH WERE LARGE AND SO ARTISTICALLY DECORATED
AND K
WOULD CERTAINLY NOT HAVE NOTICED THIS LITTLE PULPIT IF
THERE HAD NOT BEEN A LAMP FASTENED ABOVE IT WHICH USUALLY MEANT THERE
WAS A SERMON ABOUT TO BE GIVEN
SO WAS A SERMON TO BE GIVEN NOW IN
THIS EMPTY CHURCH K
LOOKED DOWN AT THE STEPS WHICH PRESSED CLOSE
AGAINST THE COLUMN LED UP TO THE PULPIT
THEY WERE SO NARROW THEY
SEEMED TO BE THERE AS DECORATION ON THE COLUMN RATHER THAN FOR ANYONE TO
USE
BUT UNDER THE PULPIT K
GRINNED IN ASTONISHMENT THERE REALLY
WAS A PRIEST STANDING WITH HIS HAND ON THE HANDRAIL READY TO CLIMB THE
STEPS AND LOOKING AT K
THEN HE NODDED VERY SLIGHTLY SO THAT K
CROSSED HIMSELF AND GENUFLECTED AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE EARLIER
WITH A
LITTLE SWING THE PRIEST WENT UP INTO THE PULPIT WITH SHORT FAST STEPS
WAS THERE REALLY A SERMON ABOUT TO BEGIN MAYBE THE MAN IN THE CASSOCK
HAD NOT BEEN REALLY SO DEMENTED AND HAD MEANT TO LEAD K 'S WAY TO THE
PREACHER WHICH IN THIS EMPTY CHURCH WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY NECESSARY
AND THERE WAS ALSO SOMEWHERE IN FRONT OF A PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN MARY
AN OLD WOMAN WHO SHOULD HAVE COME TO HEAR THE SERMON
AND IF THERE WAS
TO BE A SERMON WHY HAD IT NOT BEEN INTRODUCED ON THE ORGAN BUT THE
ORGAN REMAINED QUIET AND MERELY LOOKED OUT WEAKLY FROM THE DARKNESS OF
ITS GREAT HEIGHT
K
NOW CONSIDERED WHETHER HE SHOULD LEAVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
IF HE DID NOT DO IT NOW THERE WOULD BE NO CHANCE OF DOING SO DURING THE
SERMON AND HE WOULD HAVE TO STAY THERE FOR AS LONG AS IT LASTED HE HAD
LOST SO MUCH TIME WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN HIS OFFICE THERE HAD LONG
BEEN NO NEED FOR HIM TO WAIT FOR THE ITALIAN ANY LONGER HE LOOKED AT
HIS WATCH IT WAS ELEVEN
BUT COULD THERE REALLY BE A SERMON GIVEN
COULD K
CONSTITUTE THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION HOW COULD HE WHEN HE WAS
JUST A STRANGER WHO WANTED TO LOOK AT THE CHURCH THAT BASICALLY WAS
ALL HE WAS
THE IDEA OF A SERMON NOW AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ON A WORKDAY
IN HIDEOUS WEATHER WAS NONSENSE
THE PRIEST THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT
HE WAS A PRIEST A YOUNG MAN WITH A SMOOTH DARK FACE WAS CLEARLY
GOING UP THERE JUST TO PUT THE LAMP OUT AFTER SOMEBODY HAD LIT IT BY
MISTAKE
BUT THERE HAD BEEN NO MISTAKE THE PRIEST SEEMED RATHER TO CHECK
THAT THE LAMP WAS LIT AND TURNED IT A LITTLE HIGHER THEN HE SLOWLY
TURNED TO FACE THE FRONT AND LEANT DOWN ON THE BALUSTRADE GRIPPING ITS
ANGULAR RAIL WITH BOTH HANDS
HE STOOD THERE LIKE THAT FOR A WHILE AND
WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD LOOKED AROUND
K
HAD MOVED BACK A LONG WAY
AND LEANT HIS ELBOWS ON THE FRONT PEW
SOMEWHERE IN THE CHURCH HE
COULD NOT HAVE SAID EXACTLY WHERE HE COULD MAKE OUT THE MAN IN THE
CASSOCK HUNCHED UNDER HIS BENT BACK AND AT PEACE AS IF HIS WORK WERE
COMPLETED
IN THE CATHEDRAL IT WAS NOW VERY QUIET BUT K
WOULD HAVE
TO DISTURB THAT SILENCE HE HAD NO INTENTION OF STAYING THERE IF IT WAS
THE PRIEST'S DUTY TO PREACH AT A CERTAIN TIME REGARDLESS OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES THEN HE COULD AND HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT K 'S TAKING
PART AND K 'S PRESENCE WOULD DO NOTHING TO AUGMENT THE EFFECT OF IT
SO K
BEGAN SLOWLY TO MOVE FELT HIS WAY ON TIPTOE ALONG THE PEW
ARRIVED AT THE BROAD AISLE AND WENT ALONG IT WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED
EXCEPT FOR THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS HOWEVER LIGHT WHICH RANG OUT ON THE
STONE FLOOR AND RESOUNDED FROM THE VAULTING QUIET BUT CONTINUOUS AT A
REPEATING REGULAR PACE
K
FELT SLIGHTLY ABANDONED AS PROBABLY
OBSERVED BY THE PRIEST HE WALKED BY HIMSELF BETWEEN THE EMPTY PEWS AND
THE SIZE OF THE CATHEDRAL SEEMED TO BE JUST AT THE LIMIT OF WHAT A MAN
COULD BEAR
WHEN HE ARRIVED BACK AT WHERE HE HAD BEEN SITTING HE DID
NOT HESITATE BUT SIMPLY REACHED OUT FOR THE ALBUM HE HAD LEFT THERE AND
TOOK IT WITH HIM
HE HAD NEARLY LEFT THE AREA COVERED BY PEWS AND WAS
CLOSE TO THE EMPTY SPACE BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE EXIT WHEN FOR THE
FIRST TIME HE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE PRIEST
A POWERFUL AND
EXPERIENCED VOICE
IT PIERCED THROUGH THE REACHES OF THE CATHEDRAL
READY WAITING FOR IT BUT THE PRIEST WAS NOT CALLING OUT TO THE
CONGREGATION HIS CRY WAS QUITE UNAMBIGUOUS AND THERE WAS NO ESCAPE FROM
IT HE CALLED JOSEF K
K
STOOD STILL AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE FLOOR
IN THEORY HE WAS
STILL FREE HE COULD HAVE CARRIED ON WALKING THROUGH ONE OF THREE DARK
LITTLE WOODEN DOORS NOT FAR IN FRONT OF HIM AND AWAY FROM THERE
IT
WOULD SIMPLY MEAN HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD OR THAT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD BUT
CHOSE NOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO IT
BUT IF HE ONCE TURNED ROUND HE WOULD
BE TRAPPED THEN HE WOULD HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD UNDERSTOOD
PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE REALLY WAS THE JOSEF K
THE PRIEST HAD CALLED TO
AND THAT HE WAS WILLING TO FOLLOW
IF THE PRIEST HAD CALLED OUT AGAIN
K
WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CARRIED ON OUT THE DOOR BUT EVERYTHING WAS
SILENT AS K
ALSO WAITED HE TURNED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY AS HE WANTED TO
SEE WHAT THE PRIEST WAS DOING NOW
HE WAS MERELY STANDING IN THE PULPIT
AS BEFORE BUT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD SEEN K
TURN HIS HEAD
IF K
DID NOT NOW TURN ROUND COMPLETELY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE A CHILD
PLAYING HIDE AND SEEK
HE DID SO AND THE PRIEST BECKONED HIM WITH HIS
FINGER
AS EVERYTHING COULD NOW BE DONE OPENLY HE RAN BECAUSE OF
CURIOSITY AND THE WISH TO GET IT OVER WITH WITH LONG FLYING LEAPS
TOWARDS THE PULPIT
AT THE FRONT PEWS HE STOPPED BUT TO THE PRIEST HE
STILL SEEMED TOO FAR AWAY HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND AND POINTED SHARPLY
DOWN WITH HIS FINGER TO A PLACE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE PULPIT
AND
K
DID AS HE WAS TOLD STANDING IN THAT PLACE HE HAD TO BEND HIS HEAD A
LONG WAY BACK JUST TO SEE THE PRIEST
YOU ARE JOSEF K SAID THE
PRIEST AND RAISED HIS HAND FROM THE BALUSTRADE TO MAKE A GESTURE WHOSE
MEANING WAS UNCLEAR
YES SAID K HE CONSIDERED HOW FREELY HE HAD
ALWAYS GIVEN HIS NAME IN THE PAST FOR SOME TIME NOW IT HAD BEEN A
BURDEN TO HIM NOW THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIS NAME WHOM HE HAD NEVER
SEEN BEFORE IT HAD BEEN SO NICE FIRST TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND ONLY
THEN FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO YOU WERE
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED SAID THE
PRIEST ESPECIALLY GENTLY
YES SAID K SO I HAVE BEEN INFORMED
THEN YOU ARE THE ONE I AM LOOKING FOR SAID THE PRIEST
I AM THE
PRISON CHAPLAIN I SEE SAID K
I HAD YOU SUMMONED HERE SAID THE
PRIEST BECAUSE I WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU I KNEW NOTHING OF THAT
SAID K
I CAME HERE TO SHOW THE CATHEDRAL TO A GENTLEMAN FROM ITALY
THAT IS BESIDE THE POINT SAID THE PRIEST
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING IN
YOUR HAND IS IT A PRAYER BOOK NO ANSWERED K IT'S AN ALBUM OF
THE CITY'S TOURIST SIGHTS PUT IT DOWN SAID THE PRIEST
K
THREW
IT AWAY WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT FLAPPED OPEN AND ROLLED ACROSS THE
FLOOR TEARING ITS PAGES
DO YOU KNOW YOUR CASE IS GOING BADLY ASKED
THE PRIEST
THAT'S HOW IT SEEMS TO ME TOO SAID K
I'VE EXPENDED A
LOT OF EFFORT ON IT BUT SO FAR WITH NO RESULT
ALTHOUGH I DO STILL
HAVE SOME DOCUMENTS TO SUBMIT HOW DO YOU IMAGINE IT WILL END ASKED
THE PRIEST
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS BOUND TO END WELL SAID K
BUT NOW I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT IT
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL END
DO
YOU KNOW I DON'T SAID THE PRIEST BUT I FEAR IT WILL END BADLY
YOU ARE CONSIDERED GUILTY
YOUR CASE WILL PROBABLY NOT EVEN GO BEYOND A
MINOR COURT
PROVISIONALLY AT LEAST YOUR GUILT IS SEEN AS PROVEN
BUT I'M NOT GUILTY SAID K THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE
HOW IS IT EVEN
POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE TO BE GUILTY
WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS HERE ONE
LIKE THE OTHER THAT IS TRUE SAID THE PRIEST BUT THAT IS HOW THE
GUILTY SPEAK DO YOU PRESUME I'M GUILTY TOO ASKED K
I MAKE NO
PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT YOU SAID THE PRIEST
I THANK YOU FOR THAT SAID
K
BUT EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED IN THESE PROCEEDINGS HAS SOMETHING
AGAINST ME AND PRESUMES I'M GUILTY
THEY EVEN INFLUENCE THOSE WHO
AREN'T INVOLVED
MY POSITION GETS HARDER ALL THE TIME YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND THE FACTS SAID THE PRIEST THE VERDICT DOES NOT COME
SUDDENLY PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE UNTIL A VERDICT IS REACHED GRADUALLY
I SEE SAID K LOWERING HIS HEAD
WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO ABOUT
YOUR CASE NEXT ASKED THE PRIEST
I STILL NEED TO FIND HELP SAID
K RAISING HIS HEAD TO SEE WHAT THE PRIEST THOUGHT OF THIS
THERE ARE
STILL CERTAIN POSSIBILITIES I HAVEN'T YET MADE USE OF YOU LOOK FOR
TOO MUCH HELP FROM PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW SAID THE PRIEST
DISAPPROVINGLY AND ESPECIALLY FROM WOMEN
CAN YOU REALLY NOT SEE
THAT'S NOT THE HELP YOU NEED SOMETIMES IN FACT QUITE OFTEN I COULD
BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT SAID K BUT NOT ALWAYS
WOMEN HAVE A LOT OF
POWER
IF I COULD PERSUADE SOME OF THE WOMEN I KNOW TO WORK TOGETHER
WITH ME THEN I WOULD BE CERTAIN TO SUCCEED
ESPECIALLY IN A COURT LIKE
THIS THAT SEEMS TO CONSIST OF NOTHING BUT WOMAN CHASERS
SHOW THE
EXAMINING JUDGE A WOMAN IN THE DISTANCE AND HE'LL RUN RIGHT OVER THE
DESK AND THE ACCUSED JUST TO GET TO HER AS SOON AS HE CAN THE
PRIEST LOWERED HIS HEAD DOWN TO THE BALUSTRADE ONLY NOW DID THE ROOF
OVER THE PULPIT SEEM TO PRESS HIM DOWN
WHAT SORT OF DREADFUL WEATHER
COULD IT BE OUTSIDE IT WAS NO LONGER JUST A DULL DAY IT WAS DEEPEST
NIGHT
NONE OF THE STAINED GLASS IN THE MAIN WINDOW SHED EVEN A FLICKER
OF LIGHT ON THE DARKNESS OF THE WALLS
AND THIS WAS THE MOMENT WHEN THE
MAN IN THE CASSOCK CHOSE TO PUT OUT THE CANDLES ON THE MAIN ALTAR ONE
BY ONE
ARE YOU CROSS WITH ME ASKED K
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
SORT OF COURT IT IS YOU SERVE HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER
WELL IT'S
JUST MY OWN EXPERIENCE SAID K
ABOVE HIM THERE WAS STILL SILENCE
I
DIDN'T MEAN TO INSULT YOU SAID K
AT THAT THE PRIEST SCREAMED DOWN
AT K CAN YOU NOT SEE TWO STEPS IN FRONT OF YOU HE SHOUTED IN
ANGER BUT IT WAS ALSO THE SCREAM OF ONE WHO SEES ANOTHER FALL AND
SHOCKED AND WITHOUT THINKING SCREAMS AGAINST HIS OWN WILL
THE TWO MEN THEN REMAINED SILENT FOR A LONG TIME
IN THE
DARKNESS BENEATH HIM THE PRIEST COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN K
DISTINCTLY ALTHOUGH K
WAS ABLE TO SEE HIM CLEARLY BY THE LIGHT OF THE
LITTLE LAMP
WHY DID THE PRIEST NOT COME DOWN HE HAD NOT GIVEN A
SERMON HE HAD ONLY TOLD K
A FEW THINGS WHICH IF HE FOLLOWED THEM
CLOSELY WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE HIM MORE HARM THAN GOOD
BUT THE PRIEST
CERTAINLY SEEMED TO MEAN WELL IT MIGHT EVEN BE POSSIBLE IF HE WOULD
COME DOWN AND COOPERATE WITH HIM IT MIGHT EVEN BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO
OBTAIN SOME ACCEPTABLE PIECE OF ADVICE THAT COULD MAKE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IT MIGHT FOR INSTANCE BE ABLE TO SHOW HIM NOT SO MUCH TO
INFLUENCE THE PROCEEDINGS BUT HOW TO BREAK FREE OF THEM HOW TO EVADE
THEM HOW TO LIVE AWAY FROM THEM
K
HAD TO ADMIT THAT THIS WAS
SOMETHING HE HAD HAD ON HIS MIND QUITE A LOT OF LATE
IF THE PRIEST
KNEW OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY HE MIGHT IF K
ASKED HIM LET HIM KNOW ABOUT
IT EVEN THOUGH HE WAS PART OF THE COURT HIMSELF AND EVEN THOUGH WHEN
K
HAD CRITICISED THE COURT HE HAD HELD DOWN HIS GENTLE NATURE AND
ACTUALLY SHOUTED AT K
WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO COME DOWN HERE ASKED K
IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO GIVE A SERMON COME DOWN HERE WITH ME NOW I CAN COME DOWN
SAID THE PRIEST PERHAPS HE REGRETTED HAVING SHOUTED AT K
AS HE TOOK
DOWN THE LAMP FROM ITS HOOK HE SAID TO START OFF WITH I HAD TO SPEAK
TO YOU FROM A DISTANCE
OTHERWISE I'M TOO EASILY INFLUENCED AND FORGET
MY DUTY
K
WAITED FOR HIM AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
WHILE HE WAS STILL ON
ONE OF THE HIGHER STEPS AS HE CAME DOWN THEM THE PRIEST REACHED OUT HIS
HAND FOR K
TO SHAKE
CAN YOU SPARE ME A LITTLE OF YOUR TIME ASKED
K
AS MUCH TIME AS YOU NEED SAID THE PRIEST AND PASSED HIM THE
LITTLE LAMP FOR HIM TO CARRY
EVEN AT CLOSE DISTANCE THE PRIEST DID NOT
LOSE A CERTAIN SOLEMNITY THAT SEEMED TO BE PART OF HIS CHARACTER
YOU
ARE VERY FRIENDLY TOWARDS ME SAID K AS THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN
BESIDE EACH OTHER IN THE DARKNESS OF ONE OF THE SIDE NAVES
THAT MAKES
YOU AN EXCEPTION AMONG ALL THOSE WHO BELONG TO THE COURT
I CAN TRUST
YOU MORE THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS I'VE SEEN
I CAN SPEAK OPENLY WITH
YOU DON'T FOOL YOURSELF SAID THE PRIEST
HOW WOULD I BE FOOLING
MYSELF ASKED K
YOU FOOL YOURSELF IN THE COURT SAID THE PRIEST
IT TALKS ABOUT THIS SELF DECEIT IN THE OPENING PARAGRAPHS TO THE LAW
IN FRONT OF THE LAW THERE IS A DOORKEEPER
A MAN FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE
COMES UP TO THE DOOR AND ASKS FOR ENTRY
BUT THE DOORKEEPER SAYS HE
CAN'T LET HIM IN TO THE LAW RIGHT NOW
THE MAN THINKS ABOUT THIS AND
THEN HE ASKS IF HE'LL BE ABLE TO GO IN LATER ON
'THAT'S POSSIBLE
SAYS THE DOORKEEPER 'BUT NOT NOW'
THE GATEWAY TO THE LAW IS OPEN AS
IT ALWAYS IS AND THE DOORKEEPER HAS STEPPED TO ONE SIDE SO THE MAN
BENDS OVER TO TRY AND SEE IN
WHEN THE DOORKEEPER NOTICES THIS HE
LAUGHS AND SAYS 'IF YOU'RE TEMPTED GIVE IT A TRY TRY AND GO IN EVEN
THOUGH I SAY YOU CAN'T
CAREFUL THOUGH I'M POWERFUL
AND I'M ONLY THE
LOWLIEST OF ALL THE DOORMEN
BUT THERE'S A DOORKEEPER FOR EACH OF THE
ROOMS AND EACH OF THEM IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE LAST
IT'S MORE THAN I
CAN STAND JUST TO LOOK AT THE THIRD ONE THE MAN FROM THE COUNTRY HAD
NOT EXPECTED DIFFICULTIES LIKE THIS THE LAW WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ACCESSIBLE FOR ANYONE AT ANY TIME HE THINKS BUT NOW HE LOOKS MORE
CLOSELY AT THE DOORKEEPER IN HIS FUR COAT SEES HIS BIG HOOKED NOSE HIS
LONG THIN TARTAR BEARD AND HE DECIDES IT'S BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL HE HAS
PERMISSION TO ENTER
THE DOORKEEPER GIVES HIM A STOOL AND LETS HIM SIT
DOWN TO ONE SIDE OF THE GATE
HE SITS THERE FOR DAYS AND YEARS
HE
TRIES TO BE ALLOWED IN TIME AND AGAIN AND TIRES THE DOORKEEPER WITH HIS
REQUESTS
THE DOORKEEPER OFTEN QUESTIONS HIM ASKING ABOUT WHERE HE'S
FROM AND MANY OTHER THINGS BUT THESE ARE DISINTERESTED QUESTIONS SUCH
AS GREAT MEN ASK AND HE ALWAYS ENDS UP BY TELLING HIM HE STILL CAN'T
LET HIM IN
THE MAN HAD COME WELL EQUIPPED FOR HIS JOURNEY AND USES
EVERYTHING HOWEVER VALUABLE TO BRIBE THE DOORKEEPER
HE ACCEPTS
EVERYTHING BUT AS HE DOES SO HE SAYS 'I'LL ONLY ACCEPT THIS SO THAT
YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'VE FAILED TO DO'
OVER MANY YEARS
THE MAN WATCHES THE DOORKEEPER ALMOST WITHOUT A BREAK
HE FORGETS ABOUT
THE OTHER DOORMEN AND BEGINS TO THINK THIS ONE IS THE ONLY THING
STOPPING HIM FROM GAINING ACCESS TO THE LAW
OVER THE FIRST FEW YEARS HE
CURSES HIS UNHAPPY CONDITION OUT LOUD BUT LATER AS HE BECOMES OLD HE
JUST GRUMBLES TO HIMSELF
HE BECOMES SENILE AND AS HE HAS COME TO KNOW
EVEN THE FLEAS IN THE DOORKEEPER'S FUR COLLAR OVER THE YEARS THAT HE HAS
BEEN STUDYING HIM HE EVEN ASKS THEM TO HELP HIM AND CHANGE THE
DOORKEEPER'S MIND
FINALLY HIS EYES GROW DIM AND HE NO LONGER KNOWS
WHETHER IT'S REALLY GETTING DARKER OR JUST HIS EYES THAT ARE DECEIVING
HIM
BUT HE SEEMS NOW TO SEE AN INEXTINGUISHABLE LIGHT BEGIN TO SHINE
FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND THE DOOR
HE DOESN'T HAVE LONG TO LIVE NOW
JUST BEFORE HE DIES HE BRINGS TOGETHER ALL HIS EXPERIENCE FROM ALL THIS
TIME INTO ONE QUESTION WHICH HE HAS STILL NEVER PUT TO THE DOORKEEPER
HE BECKONS TO HIM AS HE'S NO LONGER ABLE TO RAISE HIS STIFF BODY
THE
DOORKEEPER HAS TO BEND OVER DEEPLY AS THE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SIZES HAS
CHANGED VERY MUCH TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE MAN
'WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
TO KNOW NOW ASKS THE DOORKEEPER 'YOU'RE INSATIABLE 'EVERYONE WANTS
ACCESS TO THE LAW SAYS THE MAN 'HOW COME OVER ALL THESE YEARS NO
ONE BUT ME HAS ASKED TO BE LET IN THE DOORKEEPER CAN SEE THE MAN'S
COME TO HIS END HIS HEARING HAS FADED AND SO SO THAT HE CAN BE HEARD
HE SHOUTS TO HIM 'NOBODY ELSE COULD HAVE GOT IN THIS WAY AS THIS
ENTRANCE WAS MEANT ONLY FOR YOU
NOW I'LL GO AND CLOSE IT'
SO THE DOORKEEPER CHEATED THE MAN SAID K
IMMEDIATELY WHO HAD
BEEN CAPTIVATED BY THE STORY
DON'T BE TOO QUICK SAID THE PRIEST
DON'T TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S OPINION WITHOUT CHECKING IT
I TOLD YOU THE
STORY EXACTLY AS IT WAS WRITTEN
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE ABOUT
CHEATING BUT IT'S QUITE CLEAR SAID K AND YOUR FIRST
INTERPRETATION OF IT WAS QUITE CORRECT
THE DOORKEEPER GAVE HIM THE
INFORMATION THAT WOULD RELEASE HIM ONLY WHEN IT COULD BE OF NO MORE
USE HE DIDN'T ASK HIM BEFORE THAT SAID THE PRIEST AND DON'T
FORGET HE WAS ONLY A DOORKEEPER AND AS DOORKEEPER HE DID HIS DUTY
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK HE DID HIS DUTY ASKED K HE DIDN'T
IT MIGHT
HAVE BEEN HIS DUTY TO KEEP EVERYONE ELSE AWAY BUT THIS MAN IS WHO THE
DOOR WAS INTENDED FOR AND HE OUGHT TO HAVE LET HIM IN YOU'RE NOT
PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS WRITTEN AND YOU'RE CHANGING THE
STORY SAID THE PRIEST
ACCORDING TO THE STORY THERE ARE TWO
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT THE DOORKEEPER EXPLAINS ABOUT ACCESS TO THE LAW
ONE AT THE BEGINNING ONE AT THE END
AT ONE PLACE HE SAYS HE CAN'T
ALLOW HIM IN NOW AND AT THE OTHER HE SAYS THIS ENTRANCE WAS INTENDED
FOR HIM ALONE
IF ONE OF THE STATEMENTS CONTRADICTED THE OTHER YOU
WOULD BE RIGHT AND THE DOORKEEPER WOULD HAVE CHEATED THE MAN FROM THE
COUNTRY
BUT THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION
ON THE CONTRARY THE FIRST
STATEMENT EVEN HINTS AT THE SECOND
YOU COULD ALMOST SAY THE DOORKEEPER
WENT BEYOND HIS DUTY IN THAT HE OFFERED THE MAN SOME PROSPECT OF BEING
ADMITTED IN THE FUTURE
THROUGHOUT THE STORY HIS DUTY SEEMS TO HAVE
BEEN MERELY TO TURN THE MAN AWAY AND THERE ARE MANY COMMENTATORS WHO
ARE SURPRISED THAT THE DOORKEEPER OFFERED THIS HINT AT ALL AS HE SEEMS
TO LOVE EXACTITUDE AND KEEPS STRICT GUARD OVER HIS POSITION
HE STAYS
AT HIS POST FOR MANY YEARS AND DOESN'T CLOSE THE GATE UNTIL THE VERY
END HE'S VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS SERVICE AS HE SAYS
'I'M POWERFUL HE HAS RESPECT FOR HIS SUPERIORS AS HE SAYS 'I'M ONLY
THE LOWLIEST OF THE DOORMEN' HE'S NOT TALKATIVE AS THROUGH ALL THESE
YEARS THE ONLY QUESTIONS HE ASKS ARE 'DISINTERESTED' HE'S NOT
CORRUPTIBLE AS WHEN HE'S OFFERED A GIFT HE SAYS 'I'LL ONLY ACCEPT THIS
SO THAT YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'VE FAILED TO DO AS FAR AS
FULFILLING HIS DUTY GOES HE CAN BE NEITHER RUFFLED NOR BEGGED AS IT
SAYS ABOUT THE MAN THAT 'HE TIRES THE DOORKEEPER WITH HIS REQUESTS'
EVEN HIS EXTERNAL APPEARANCE SUGGESTS A PEDANTIC CHARACTER THE BIG
HOOKED NOSE AND THE LONG THIN BLACK TARTAR BEARD
HOW COULD ANY
DOORKEEPER BE MORE FAITHFUL TO HIS DUTY BUT IN THE DOORKEEPER'S
CHARACTER THERE ARE ALSO OTHER FEATURES WHICH MIGHT BE VERY USEFUL FOR
THOSE WHO SEEK ENTRY TO THE LAW AND WHEN HE HINTED AT SOME POSSIBILITY
IN THE FUTURE IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE MIGHT EVEN GO
BEYOND HIS DUTY
THERE'S NO DENYING HE'S A LITTLE SIMPLE MINDED AND
THAT MAKES HIM A LITTLE CONCEITED
EVEN IF ALL HE SAID ABOUT HIS POWER
AND THE POWER OF THE OTHER DOORKEEPERS AND HOW NOT EVEN HE COULD BEAR
THE SIGHT OF THEM I SAY EVEN IF ALL THESE ASSERTIONS ARE RIGHT THE
WAY HE MAKES THEM SHOWS THAT HE'S TOO SIMPLE AND ARROGANT TO UNDERSTAND
PROPERLY
THE COMMENTATORS SAY ABOUT THIS THAT 'CORRECT UNDERSTANDING
OF A MATTER AND A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE SAME MATTER ARE NOT MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE'
WHETHER THEY'RE RIGHT OR NOT YOU HAVE TO CONCEDE THAT HIS
SIMPLICITY AND ARROGANCE HOWEVER LITTLE THEY SHOW DO WEAKEN HIS
FUNCTION OF GUARDING THE ENTRANCE THEY ARE DEFECTS IN THE DOORKEEPER'S
CHARACTER
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT THE DOORKEEPER SEEMS TO BE
FRIENDLY BY NATURE HE ISN'T ALWAYS JUST AN OFFICIAL
HE MAKES A JOKE
RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING IN THAT HE INVITES THE MAN TO ENTER AT THE SAME
TIME AS MAINTAINING THE BAN ON HIS ENTERING AND THEN HE DOESN'T SEND
HIM AWAY BUT GIVES HIM AS IT SAYS IN THE TEXT A STOOL TO SIT ON AND
LETS HIM STAY BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR
THE PATIENCE WITH WHICH HE PUTS
UP WITH THE MAN'S REQUESTS THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS THE LITTLE
QUESTIONING SESSIONS ACCEPTING THE GIFTS HIS POLITENESS WHEN HE PUTS
UP WITH THE MAN CURSING HIS FATE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE DOORKEEPER WHO
CAUSED THAT FATE ALL THESE THINGS SEEM TO WANT TO AROUSE OUR SYMPATHY
NOT EVERY DOORKEEPER WOULD HAVE BEHAVED IN THE SAME WAY
AND FINALLY
HE LETS THE MAN BECKON HIM AND HE BENDS DEEP DOWN TO HIM SO THAT HE CAN
PUT HIS LAST QUESTION
THERE'S NO MORE THAN SOME SLIGHT IMPATIENCE
THE DOORKEEPER KNOWS EVERYTHING'S COME TO ITS END SHOWN IN THE WORDS
'YOU'RE INSATIABLE'
THERE ARE MANY COMMENTATORS WHO GO EVEN FURTHER IN
EXPLAINING IT IN THIS WAY AND THINK THE WORDS 'YOU'RE INSATIABLE' ARE
AN EXPRESSION OF FRIENDLY ADMIRATION ALBEIT WITH SOME CONDESCENSION
HOWEVER YOU LOOK AT IT THE FIGURE OF THE DOORKEEPER COMES OUT
DIFFERENTLY FROM HOW YOU MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW THE STORY BETTER THAN
I DO AND YOU'VE KNOWN IT FOR LONGER SAID K
THEY WERE SILENT FOR A
WHILE
AND THEN K
SAID SO YOU THINK THE MAN WAS NOT CHEATED DO
YOU DON'T GET ME WRONG SAID THE PRIEST I'M JUST POINTING OUT THE
DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT IT
YOU SHOULDN'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO
PEOPLE'S OPINIONS
THE TEXT CANNOT BE ALTERED AND THE VARIOUS OPINIONS
ARE OFTEN NO MORE THAN AN EXPRESSION OF DESPAIR OVER IT
THERE'S EVEN
ONE OPINION WHICH SAYS IT'S THE DOORKEEPER WHO'S BEEN CHEATED THAT
DOES SEEM TO TAKE THINGS TOO FAR SAID K
HOW CAN THEY ARGUE THE
DOORKEEPER HAS BEEN CHEATED THEIR ARGUMENT ANSWERED THE PRIEST
IS BASED ON THE SIMPLICITY OF THE DOORKEEPER
THEY SAY THE DOORKEEPER
DOESN'T KNOW THE INSIDE OF THE LAW ONLY THE WAY INTO IT WHERE HE JUST
WALKS UP AND DOWN
THEY SEE HIS IDEAS OF WHAT'S INSIDE THE LAW AS
RATHER CHILDISH AND SUPPOSE HE'S AFRAID HIMSELF OF WHAT HE WANTS TO
MAKE THE MAN FRIGHTENED OF
YES HE'S MORE AFRAID OF IT THAN THE MAN
AS THE MAN WANTS NOTHING BUT TO GO INSIDE THE LAW EVEN AFTER HE'S HEARD
ABOUT THE TERRIBLE DOORMEN THERE IN CONTRAST TO THE DOORKEEPER WHO
DOESN'T WANT TO GO IN OR AT LEAST WE DON'T HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT IT
ON
THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY HE MUST HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSIDE
THE LAW AS HE HAS BEEN TAKEN ON INTO ITS SERVICE AND THAT COULD ONLY
HAVE BEEN DONE INSIDE
THAT CAN BE COUNTERED BY SUPPOSING HE COULD HAVE
BEEN GIVEN THE JOB OF DOORKEEPER BY SOMEBODY CALLING OUT FROM INSIDE
AND THAT HE CAN'T HAVE GONE VERY FAR INSIDE AS HE COULDN'T BEAR THE
SIGHT OF THE THIRD DOORKEEPER
NOR THROUGH ALL THOSE YEARS DOES THE
STORY SAY THE DOORKEEPER TOLD THE MAN ANYTHING ABOUT THE INSIDE OTHER
THAN HIS COMMENT ABOUT THE OTHER DOORKEEPERS
HE COULD HAVE BEEN
FORBIDDEN TO DO SO BUT HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THAT EITHER
ALL
THIS SEEMS TO SHOW HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE INSIDE LOOKS
LIKE OR WHAT IT MEANS AND THAT THAT'S WHY HE'S BEING DECEIVED
BUT
HE'S ALSO BEING DECEIVED BY THE MAN FROM THE COUNTRY AS HE'S THIS MAN'S
SUBORDINATE AND DOESN'T KNOW IT
THERE'S A LOT TO INDICATE THAT HE
TREATS THE MAN AS HIS SUBORDINATE I EXPECT YOU REMEMBER BUT THOSE WHO
HOLD THIS VIEW WOULD SAY IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HE REALLY IS HIS
SUBORDINATE
ABOVE ALL THE FREE MAN IS SUPERIOR TO THE MAN WHO HAS TO
SERVE ANOTHER
NOW THE MAN REALLY IS FREE HE CAN GO WHEREVER HE
WANTS THE ONLY THING FORBIDDEN TO HIM IS ENTRY INTO THE LAW AND WHAT'S
MORE THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN FORBIDDING HIM TO DO SO THE DOORKEEPER
IF
HE TAKES THE STOOL AND SITS DOWN BESIDE THE DOOR AND STAYS THERE ALL HIS
LIFE HE DOES THIS OF HIS OWN FREE WILL THERE'S NOTHING IN THE STORY TO
SAY HE WAS FORCED TO DO IT
ON THE OTHER HAND THE DOORKEEPER IS KEPT
TO HIS POST BY HIS EMPLOYMENT HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO GO AWAY FROM IT AND
IT SEEMS HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO GO INSIDE EITHER NOT EVEN IF HE WANTED TO
ALSO ALTHOUGH HE'S IN THE SERVICE OF THE LAW HE'S ONLY THERE FOR THIS
ONE ENTRANCE THEREFORE HE'S THERE ONLY IN THE SERVICE OF THIS ONE MAN
WHO THE DOOR'S INTENDED FOR
THIS IS ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH HE'S HIS
SUBORDINATE
WE CAN TAKE IT THAT HE'S BEEN PERFORMING THIS SOMEWHAT
EMPTY SERVICE FOR MANY YEARS THROUGH THE WHOLE OF A MAN'S LIFE AS IT
SAYS THAT A MAN WILL COME THAT MEANS SOMEONE OLD ENOUGH TO BE A MAN
THAT MEANS THE DOORKEEPER WILL HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME BEFORE HIS
FUNCTION IS FULFILLED HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR AS LONG AS THE MAN
LIKED WHO CAME TO THE DOOR OF HIS OWN FREE WILL
EVEN THE END OF THE
DOORKEEPER'S SERVICE IS DETERMINED BY WHEN THE MAN'S LIFE ENDS SO THE
DOORKEEPER REMAINS HIS SUBORDINATE RIGHT TO THE END
AND IT'S POINTED
OUT REPEATEDLY THAT THE DOORKEEPER SEEMS TO KNOW NOTHING OF ANY OF THIS
ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT SEEN AS ANYTHING REMARKABLE AS THOSE WHO HOLD THIS
VIEW SEE THE DOORKEEPER AS DELUDED IN A WAY THAT'S FAR WORSE A WAY
THAT'S TO DO WITH HIS SERVICE
AT THE END SPEAKING ABOUT THE ENTRANCE
HE SAYS 'NOW I'LL GO AND CLOSE IT' ALTHOUGH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
STORY IT SAYS THE DOOR TO THE LAW IS OPEN AS IT ALWAYS IS BUT IF IT'S
ALWAYS OPEN ALWAYS THAT MEANS IT'S OPEN INDEPENDENTLY OF THE
LIFESPAN OF THE MAN IT'S INTENDED FOR AND NOT EVEN THE DOORKEEPER WILL
BE ABLE TO CLOSE IT
THERE ARE VARIOUS OPINIONS ABOUT THIS SOME SAY
THE DOORKEEPER WAS ONLY ANSWERING A QUESTION OR SHOWING HIS DEVOTION TO
DUTY OR JUST WHEN THE MAN WAS IN HIS LAST MOMENTS THE DOORKEEPER
WANTED TO CAUSE HIM REGRET AND SORROW
THERE ARE MANY WHO AGREE THAT HE
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE DOOR
THEY EVEN BELIEVE AT THE END AT
LEAST THE DOORKEEPER IS AWARE DEEP DOWN THAT HE'S THE MAN'S
SUBORDINATE AS THE MAN SEES THE LIGHT THAT SHINES OUT OF THE ENTRY TO
THE LAW WHEREAS THE DOORKEEPER WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HIS BACK TO IT AND
SAYS NOTHING AT ALL TO SHOW THERE'S BEEN ANY CHANGE THAT IS WELL
SUBSTANTIATED SAID K WHO HAD BEEN REPEATING SOME PARTS OF THE
PRIEST'S EXPLANATION TO HIMSELF IN A WHISPER
IT IS WELL
SUBSTANTIATED AND NOW I TOO THINK THE DOORKEEPER MUST HAVE BEEN
DECEIVED
ALTHOUGH THAT DOES NOT MEAN I'VE ABANDONED WHAT I THOUGHT
EARLIER AS THE TWO VERSIONS ARE TO SOME EXTENT NOT INCOMPATIBLE
IT'S
NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE DOORKEEPER SEES CLEARLY OR IS DECEIVED
I SAID
THE MAN HAD BEEN CHEATED
IF THE DOORKEEPER UNDERSTANDS CLEARLY THEN
THERE COULD BE SOME DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT IF THE DOORKEEPER HAS BEEN
DECEIVED THEN THE MAN IS BOUND TO BELIEVE THE SAME THING
THAT WOULD
MEAN THE DOORKEEPER IS NOT A CHEAT BUT SO SIMPLE MINDED THAT HE OUGHT TO
BE DISMISSED FROM HIS JOB IMMEDIATELY IF THE DOORKEEPER IS MISTAKEN IT
WILL DO HIM NO HARM BUT THE MAN WILL BE HARMED IMMENSELY THERE
YOU'VE FOUND ANOTHER OPINION SAID THE PRIEST AS THERE ARE MANY WHO
SAY THE STORY DOESN'T GIVE ANYONE THE RIGHT TO JUDGE THE DOORKEEPER
HOWEVER HE MIGHT SEEM TO US HE IS STILL IN THE SERVICE OF THE LAW SO HE
BELONGS TO THE LAW SO HE'S BEYOND WHAT MAN HAS A RIGHT TO JUDGE
IN
THIS CASE WE CAN'T BELIEVE THE DOORKEEPER IS THE MAN'S SUBORDINATE
EVEN IF HE HAS TO STAY AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE LAW HIS SERVICE MAKES
HIM INCOMPARABLY MORE THAN IF HE LIVED FREELY IN THE WORLD
THE MAN HAS
COME TO THE LAW FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE DOORKEEPER IS ALREADY THERE
HE'S BEEN GIVEN HIS POSITION BY THE LAW TO DOUBT HIS WORTH WOULD BE TO
DOUBT THE LAW I CAN'T SAY I'M IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH THIS VIEW
SAID K
SHAKING HIS HEAD AS IF YOU ACCEPT IT YOU'LL HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT EVERYTHING SAID BY THE DOORKEEPER IS TRUE
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY
EXPLAINED VERY FULLY THAT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE NO SAID THE PRIEST
YOU DON'T NEED TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING AS TRUE YOU ONLY HAVE TO ACCEPT IT
AS NECESSARY DEPRESSING VIEW SAID K
THE LIE MADE INTO THE RULE
OF THE WORLD
K
SAID THAT AS IF IT WERE HIS FINAL WORD BUT IT WAS NOT HIS
CONCLUSION
HE WAS TOO TIRED TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF
THE STORY AND THE SORT OF THOUGHTS THEY LED HIM INTO WERE NOT FAMILIAR
TO HIM UNREALISTIC THINGS THINGS BETTER SUITED FOR OFFICIALS OF THE
COURT TO DISCUSS THAN FOR HIM
THE SIMPLE STORY HAD LOST ITS SHAPE HE
WANTED TO SHAKE IT OFF AND THE PRIEST WHO NOW FELT QUITE COMPASSIONATE
ALLOWED THIS AND ACCEPTED K 'S REMARKS WITHOUT COMMENT EVEN THOUGH HIS
VIEW WAS CERTAINLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM K 'S
IN SILENCE THEY CARRIED ON WALKING FOR SOME TIME K
STAYED CLOSE
BESIDE THE PRIEST WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS
THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
HAD LONG SINCE GONE OUT
ONCE JUST IN FRONT OF HIM HE THOUGHT HE
COULD SEE THE STATUE OF A SAINT BY THE GLITTER OF THE SILVER ON IT
ALTHOUGH IT QUICKLY DISAPPEARED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS
SO THAT HE
WOULD NOT REMAIN ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE PRIEST K
ASKED HIM WE'RE
NOW NEAR THE MAIN ENTRANCE ARE WE NO SAID THE PRIEST WE'RE A
LONG WAY FROM IT
DO YOU ALREADY WANT TO GO K
HAD NOT THOUGHT OF
GOING UNTIL THEN BUT HE IMMEDIATELY SAID
YES CERTAINLY I HAVE TO GO
I'M THE CHIEF CLERK IN A BANK AND THERE
ARE PEOPLE WAITING FOR ME I ONLY CAME HERE TO SHOW A FOREIGN BUSINESS
CONTACT ROUND THE CATHEDRAL ALRIGHT SAID THE PRIEST OFFERING HIM
HIS HAND GO THEN BUT I CAN'T FIND MY WAY ROUND IN THIS DARKNESS BY
MYSELF SAID K
GO TO YOUR LEFT AS FAR AS THE WALL SAID THE PRIEST
THEN CONTINUE ALONGSIDE THE WALL WITHOUT LEAVING IT AND YOU'LL FIND A
WAY OUT THE PRIEST HAD ONLY GONE A FEW PACES FROM HIM BUT K
WAS
ALREADY SHOUTING LOUDLY PLEASE WAIT I'M WAITING SAID THE
PRIEST
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT FROM ME ASKED K
NO SAID
THE PRIEST
YOU WERE SO FRIENDLY TO ME EARLIER ON SAID K AND YOU
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING BUT NOW YOU ABANDON ME AS IF I WERE NOTHING TO
YOU YOU HAVE TO GO SAID THE PRIEST
WELL YES SAID K YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT FIRST YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND WHO I AM SAID THE PRIEST
YOU'RE THE PRISON CHAPLAIN
SAID K AND WENT CLOSER TO THE PRIEST IT WAS NOT SO IMPORTANT FOR HIM
TO GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE BANK AS HE HAD MADE OUT HE COULD VERY WELL
STAY WHERE HE WAS
SO THAT MEANS I BELONG TO THE COURT SAID THE
PRIEST
SO WHY WOULD I WANT ANYTHING FROM YOU THE COURT DOESN'T WANT
ANYTHING FROM YOU
IT ACCEPTS YOU WHEN YOU COME AND IT LETS YOU GO WHEN
YOU LEAVE
CHAPTER TEN
END
THE EVENING BEFORE K 'S THIRTY FIRST BIRTHDAY IT WAS ABOUT NINE
O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING THE TIME WHEN THE STREETS WERE QUIET TWO MEN
CAME TO WHERE HE LIVED
IN FROCK COATS PALE AND FAT WEARING TOP HATS
THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY COULD NOT BE TAKEN OFF THEIR HEADS
AFTER SOME
BRIEF FORMALITIES AT THE DOOR OF THE FLAT WHEN THEY FIRST ARRIVED THE
SAME FORMALITIES WERE REPEATED AT GREATER LENGTH AT K 'S DOOR
HE HAD
NOT BEEN NOTIFIED THEY WOULD BE COMING BUT K
SAT IN A CHAIR NEAR THE
DOOR DRESSED IN BLACK AS THEY WERE AND SLOWLY PUT ON NEW GLOVES WHICH
STRETCHED TIGHTLY OVER HIS FINGERS AND BEHAVED AS IF HE WERE EXPECTING
VISITORS
HE IMMEDIATELY STOOD UP AND LOOKED AT THE GENTLEMEN
INQUISITIVELY
YOU'VE COME FOR ME THEN HAVE YOU HE ASKED
THE
GENTLEMEN NODDED ONE OF THEM INDICATED THE OTHER WITH THE TOP HAND NOW
IN HIS HAND
K
TOLD THEM HE HAD BEEN EXPECTING A DIFFERENT VISITOR
HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED ONCE MORE DOWN AT THE DARK STREET
MOST OF THE WINDOWS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WERE ALSO DARK
ALREADY MANY OF THEM HAD THE CURTAINS CLOSED
IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS ON
THE SAME FLOOR WHERE THERE WAS A LIGHT ON TWO SMALL CHILDREN COULD BE
SEEN PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER INSIDE A PLAYPEN UNABLE TO MOVE FROM WHERE
THEY WERE REACHING OUT FOR EACH OTHER WITH THEIR LITTLE HANDS
SOME
ANCIENT UNIMPORTANT ACTORS THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE SENT FOR ME SAID K
TO HIMSELF AND LOOKED ROUND ONCE AGAIN TO CONFIRM THIS TO HIMSELF
THEY WANT TO SORT ME OUT AS CHEAPLY AS THEY CAN K
SUDDENLY TURNED
ROUND TO FACE THE TWO MEN AND ASKED WHAT THEATRE DO YOU PLAY IN
THEATRE ASKED ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN TURNING TO THE OTHER FOR
ASSISTANCE AND PULLING IN THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH
THE OTHER MADE A
GESTURE LIKE SOMEONE WHO WAS DUMB AS IF HE WERE STRUGGLING WITH SOME
ORGANISM CAUSING HIM TROUBLE
YOU'RE NOT PROPERLY PREPARED TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS SAID K
AND WENT TO FETCH HIS HAT
AS SOON AS THEY WERE ON THE STAIRS THE GENTLEMEN WANTED TO TAKE
K 'S ARMS BUT K
SAID WAIT TILL WE'RE IN THE STREET I'M NOT ILL
BUT THEY WAITED ONLY UNTIL THE FRONT DOOR BEFORE THEY TOOK HIS ARMS IN A
WAY THAT K
HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE
THEY KEPT THEIR SHOULDERS
CLOSE BEHIND HIS DID NOT TURN THEIR ARMS IN BUT TWISTED THEM AROUND THE
ENTIRE LENGTH OF K 'S ARMS AND TOOK HOLD OF HIS HANDS WITH A GRASP THAT
WAS FORMAL EXPERIENCED AND COULD NOT BE RESISTED
K
WAS HELD STIFF
AND UPRIGHT BETWEEN THEM THEY FORMED NOW A SINGLE UNIT SO THAT IF ANY
ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN ALL OF THEM MUST HAVE FALLEN
THEY
FORMED A UNIT OF THE SORT THAT NORMALLY CAN BE FORMED ONLY BY MATTER
THAT IS LIFELESS
WHENEVER THEY PASSED UNDER A LAMP K
TRIED TO SEE HIS COMPANIONS
MORE CLEARLY AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY WERE PRESSED SO CLOSE
TOGETHER AS IN THE DIM LIGHT OF HIS ROOM THIS HAD BEEN HARDLY POSSIBLE
MAYBE THEY'RE TENORS HE THOUGHT AS HE SAW THEIR BIG DOUBLE CHINS
THE CLEANLINESS OF THEIR FACES DISGUSTED HIM
HE COULD SEE THE HANDS
THAT CLEANED THEM PASSING OVER THE CORNERS OF THEIR EYES RUBBING AT
THEIR UPPER LIPS SCRATCHING OUT THE CREASES ON THOSE CHINS
WHEN K
NOTICED THAT HE STOPPED WHICH MEANT THE OTHERS HAD TO
STOP TOO THEY WERE AT THE EDGE OF AN OPEN SQUARE DEVOID OF PEOPLE BUT
DECORATED WITH FLOWER BEDS
WHY DID THEY SEND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE HE
CRIED OUT MORE A SHOUT THAN A QUESTION
THE TWO GENTLEMAN CLEARLY KNEW
NO ANSWER TO GIVE THEY WAITED THEIR FREE ARMS HANGING DOWN LIKE
NURSES WHEN THE PATIENT NEEDS TO REST
I WILL GO NO FURTHER SAID K
AS IF TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
THE GENTLEMEN DID NOT NEED TO MAKE ANY
ANSWER IT WAS ENOUGH THAT THEY DID NOT LOOSEN THEIR GRIP ON K
AND
TRIED TO MOVE HIM ON BUT K
RESISTED THEM
I'LL SOON HAVE NO NEED OF
MUCH STRENGTH I'LL USE ALL OF IT NOW HE THOUGHT
HE THOUGHT OF THE
FLIES THAT TEAR THEIR LEGS OFF STRUGGLING TO GET FREE OF THE FLYPAPER
THESE GENTLEMAN WILL HAVE SOME HARD WORK TO DO
JUST THEN MISS BRSTNER CAME UP INTO THE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THEM
FROM THE STEPS LEADING FROM A SMALL STREET AT A LOWER LEVEL
IT WAS NOT
CERTAIN THAT IT WAS HER ALTHOUGH THE SIMILARITY WAS OF COURSE GREAT
BUT IT DID NOT MATTER TO K
WHETHER IT WAS CERTAINLY HER ANYWAY HE JUST
BECAME SUDDENLY AWARE THAT THERE WAS NO POINT IN HIS RESISTANCE
THERE
WOULD BE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT IT IF HE RESISTED IF HE NOW CAUSED
TROUBLE FOR THESE GENTLEMEN IF IN DEFENDING HIMSELF HE SOUGHT TO ENJOY
HIS LAST GLIMMER OF LIFE
HE STARTED WALKING WHICH PLEASED THE
GENTLEMEN AND SOME OF THEIR PLEASURE CONVEYED ITSELF TO HIM
NOW THEY
PERMITTED HIM TO DECIDE WHICH DIRECTION THEY TOOK AND HE DECIDED TO
TAKE THE DIRECTION THAT FOLLOWED THE YOUNG WOMAN IN FRONT OF THEM NOT
SO MUCH BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CATCH UP WITH HER NOR EVEN BECAUSE HE
WANTED TO KEEP HER IN SIGHT FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BUT ONLY SO THAT HE
WOULD NOT FORGET THE REPROACH SHE REPRESENTED FOR HIM
THE ONLY THING
I CAN DO NOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND HIS THOUGHT WAS CONFIRMED BY THE
EQUAL LENGTH OF HIS OWN STEPS WITH THE STEPS OF THE TWO OTHERS THE
ONLY THING I CAN DO NOW IS KEEP MY COMMON SENSE AND DO WHAT'S NEEDED
RIGHT TILL THE END
I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO AT THE WORLD AND TRY AND DO
TOO MUCH AND EVEN TO DO IT FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT TOO CHEAP
THAT
WAS WRONG OF ME
SHOULD I NOW SHOW THEM I LEARNED NOTHING FROM FACING
TRIAL FOR A YEAR SHOULD I GO OUT LIKE SOMEONE STUPID SHOULD I LET
ANYONE SAY AFTER I'M GONE THAT AT THE START OF THE PROCEEDINGS I
WANTED TO END THEM AND THAT NOW THAT THEY'VE ENDED I WANT TO START THEM
AGAIN I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO SAY THAT
I'M GRATEFUL THEY SENT THESE
UNSPEAKING UNCOMPREHENDING MEN TO GO WITH ME ON THIS JOURNEY AND THAT
IT'S BEEN LEFT UP TO ME TO SAY WHAT'S NECESSARY
MEANWHILE THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD TURNED OFF INTO A SIDE STREET BUT
K
COULD DO WITHOUT HER NOW AND LET HIS COMPANIONS LEAD HIM
ALL THREE
OF THEM NOW IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT WENT OVER A BRIDGE IN THE LIGHT OF
THE MOON THE TWO GENTLEMEN WERE WILLING TO YIELD TO EACH LITTLE
MOVEMENT MADE BY K
AS HE MOVED SLIGHTLY TOWARDS THE EDGE AND DIRECTED
THE GROUP IN THAT DIRECTION AS A SINGLE UNIT
THE MOONLIGHT GLITTERED
AND QUIVERED IN THE WATER WHICH DIVIDED ITSELF AROUND A SMALL ISLAND
COVERED IN A DENSELY PILED MASS OF FOLIAGE AND TREES AND BUSHES
BENEATH THEM NOW INVISIBLE THERE WERE GRAVEL PATHS WITH COMFORTABLE
BENCHES WHERE K
HAD STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT ON MANY SUMMER'S DAYS
I
DIDN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO STOP HERE HE SAID TO HIS COMPANIONS SHAMED BY
THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH HIS WISHES
BEHIND K 'S BACK ONE OF THEM SEEMED
TO QUIETLY CRITICISE THE OTHER FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT STOPPING
AND THEN THEY WENT ON
THE WENT ON UP THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS WHERE
POLICEMEN WERE WALKING OR STANDING HERE AND THERE SOME IN THE DISTANCE
AND THEN SOME VERY CLOSE
ONE OF THEM WITH A BUSHY MOUSTACHE HIS HAND
ON THE GRIP OF HIS SWORD SEEMED TO HAVE SOME PURPOSE IN APPROACHING
THE GROUP WHICH WAS HARDLY UNSUSPICIOUS
THE TWO GENTLEMEN STOPPED
THE POLICEMAN SEEMED ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH AND THEN K
DROVE HIS
GROUP FORCEFULLY FORWARD
SEVERAL TIMES HE LOOKED BACK CAUTIOUSLY TO
SEE IF THE POLICEMAN WAS FOLLOWING BUT WHEN THEY HAD A CORNER BETWEEN
THEMSELVES AND THE POLICEMAN K
BEGAN TO RUN AND THE TWO GENTLEMEN
DESPITE BEING SERIOUSLY SHORT OF BREATH HAD TO RUN WITH HIM
IN THIS WAY THEY QUICKLY LEFT THE BUILT UP AREA AND FOUND
THEMSELVES IN THE FIELDS WHICH IN THIS PART OF TOWN BEGAN ALMOST
WITHOUT ANY TRANSITION ZONE
THERE WAS A QUARRY EMPTY AND ABANDONED
NEAR A BUILDING WHICH WAS STILL LIKE THOSE IN THE CITY
HERE THE MEN
STOPPED PERHAPS BECAUSE THIS HAD ALWAYS BEEN THEIR DESTINATION OR
PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO EXHAUSTED TO RUN ANY FURTHER
HERE THEY
RELEASED THEIR HOLD ON K WHO JUST WAITED IN SILENCE AND TOOK THEIR
TOP HATS OFF WHILE THEY LOOKED ROUND THE QUARRY AND WIPED THE SWEAT OFF
THEIR BROWS WITH THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS
THE MOONLIGHT LAY EVERYWHERE WITH
THE NATURAL PEACE THAT IS GRANTED TO NO OTHER LIGHT
AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW COURTESIES ABOUT WHO WAS TO CARRY OUT THE
NEXT TASKS THE GENTLEMEN DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED SPECIFIC
FUNCTIONS ONE OF THEM WENT TO K
AND TOOK HIS COAT HIS WAISTCOAT AND
FINALLY HIS SHIRT OFF HIM
K
MADE AN INVOLUNTARY SHIVER AT WHICH THE
GENTLEMAN GAVE HIM A GENTLE REASSURING TAP ON THE BACK
THEN HE
CAREFULLY FOLDED THE THINGS UP AS IF THEY WOULD STILL BE NEEDED EVEN IF
NOT IN THE NEAR FUTURE
HE DID NOT WANT TO EXPOSE K
TO THE CHILLY
NIGHT AIR WITHOUT MOVING THOUGH SO HE TOOK HIM UNDER THE ARM AND WALKED
UP AND DOWN WITH HIM A LITTLE WAY WHILE THE OTHER GENTLEMAN LOOKED ROUND
THE QUARRY FOR A SUITABLE PLACE
WHEN HE HAD FOUND IT HE MADE A SIGN
AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN ESCORTED HIM THERE
IT WAS NEAR THE ROCKFACE
THERE WAS A STONE LYING THERE THAT HAD BROKEN LOOSE
THE GENTLEMEN SAT
K
DOWN ON THE GROUND LEANT HIM AGAINST THE STONE AND SETTLED HIS HEAD
DOWN ON THE TOP OF IT
DESPITE ALL THE EFFORT THEY WENT TO AND DESPITE
ALL THE CO OPERATION SHOWN BY K HIS DEMEANOUR SEEMED VERY FORCED AND
HARD TO BELIEVE
SO ONE OF THE GENTLEMEN ASKED THE OTHER TO GRANT HIM A
SHORT TIME WHILE HE PUT K
IN POSITION BY HIMSELF BUT EVEN THAT DID
NOTHING TO MAKE IT BETTER
IN THE END THEY LEFT K
IN A POSITION THAT
WAS FAR FROM THE BEST OF THE ONES THEY HAD TRIED SO FAR
THEN ONE OF
THE GENTLEMEN OPENED HIS FROCK COAT AND FROM A SHEATH HANGING ON A BELT
STRETCHED ACROSS HIS WAISTCOAT HE WITHDREW A LONG THIN DOUBLE EDGED
BUTCHER'S KNIFE WHICH HE HELD UP IN THE LIGHT TO TEST ITS SHARPNESS
THE REPULSIVE COURTESIES BEGAN ONCE AGAIN ONE OF THEM PASSED THE KNIFE
OVER K
TO THE OTHER WHO THEN PASSED IT BACK OVER K
TO THE FIRST
K
NOW KNEW IT WOULD BE HIS DUTY TO TAKE THE KNIFE AS IT PASSED FROM HAND
TO HAND ABOVE HIM AND THRUST IT INTO HIMSELF
BUT HE DID NOT DO IT
INSTEAD HE TWISTED HIS NECK WHICH WAS STILL FREE AND LOOKED AROUND
HE WAS NOT ABLE TO SHOW HIS FULL WORTH WAS NOT ABLE TO TAKE ALL THE
WORK FROM THE OFFICIAL BODIES HE LACKED THE REST OF THE STRENGTH HE
NEEDED AND THIS FINAL SHORTCOMING WAS THE FAULT OF WHOEVER HAD DENIED IT
TO HIM
AS HE LOOKED ROUND HE SAW THE TOP FLOOR OF THE BUILDING NEXT
TO THE QUARRY
HE SAW HOW A LIGHT FLICKERED ON AND THE TWO HALVES OF A
WINDOW OPENED OUT SOMEBODY MADE WEAK AND THIN BY THE HEIGHT AND THE
DISTANCE LEANT SUDDENLY FAR OUT FROM IT AND STRETCHED HIS ARMS OUT EVEN
FURTHER
WHO WAS THAT A FRIEND A GOOD PERSON SOMEBODY WHO WAS
TAKING PART SOMEBODY WHO WANTED TO HELP WAS HE ALONE WAS IT
EVERYONE WOULD ANYONE HELP WERE THERE OBJECTIONS THAT HAD BEEN
FORGOTTEN THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME
THE LOGIC CANNOT BE REFUTED BUT
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO LIVE WILL NOT RESIST IT
WHERE WAS THE JUDGE HE'D
NEVER SEEN WHERE WAS THE HIGH COURT HE HAD NEVER REACHED HE RAISED
BOTH HANDS AND SPREAD OUT ALL HIS FINGERS
BUT THE HANDS OF ONE OF THE GENTLEMAN WERE LAID ON K 'S THROAT
WHILE THE OTHER PUSHED THE KNIFE DEEP INTO HIS HEART AND TWISTED IT
THERE TWICE
AS HIS EYESIGHT FAILED K
SAW THE TWO GENTLEMEN CHEEK BY
CHEEK CLOSE IN FRONT OF HIS FACE WATCHING THE RESULT
LIKE A DOG HE
SAID IT WAS AS IF THE SHAME OF IT SHOULD OUTLIVE HIM
