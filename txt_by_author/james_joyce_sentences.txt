AWAKING MOUNTAINS
THEN CATCHING SIGHT OF STEPHEN DEDALUS HE BENT
TOWARDS HIM AND MADE RAPID CROSSES IN THE AIR GURGLING IN HIS THROAT
AND SHAKING HIS HEAD
STEPHEN DEDALUS DISPLEASED AND SLEEPY LEANED
HIS ARMS ON THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND LOOKED COLDLY AT THE SHAKING
GURGLING FACE THAT BLESSED HIM EQUINE IN ITS LENGTH AND AT THE LIGHT
UNTONSURED HAIR GRAINED AND HUED LIKE PALE OAK

SULLEN OVAL JOWL RECALLED A PRELATE PATRON OF ARTS IN THE MIDDLE AGES
A PLEASANT SMILE BROKE QUIETLY OVER HIS LIPS
THE MOCKERY OF IT HE SAID GAILY

HALFWAY AND SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE GUNREST WATCHING HIM STILL AS
HE PROPPED HIS MIRROR ON THE PARAPET DIPPED THE BRUSH IN THE BOWL AND
LATHERED CHEEKS AND NECK

WITH A MAN I DON'T KNOW RAVING AND MOANING TO HIMSELF ABOUT SHOOTING A
BLACK PANTHER

BUCK MULLIGAN FROWNED AT THE LATHER ON HIS RAZORBLADE
HE HOPPED DOWN
FROM HIS PERCH AND BEGAN TO SEARCH HIS TROUSER POCKETS HASTILY
SCUTTER HE CRIED THICKLY
HE CAME OVER TO THE GUNREST AND THRUSTING A HAND INTO STEPHEN'S UPPER
POCKET SAID
LEND US A LOAN OF YOUR NOSERAG TO WIPE MY RAZOR
STEPHEN SUFFERED HIM TO PULL OUT AND HOLD UP ON SHOW BY ITS CORNER A
DIRTY CRUMPLED HANDKERCHIEF

KINGSTOWN

FACE

ASKED YOU BUCK MULLIGAN SAID
I'M HYPERBOREAN AS MUCH AS YOU
BUT TO
THINK OF YOUR MOTHER BEGGING YOU WITH HER LAST BREATH TO KNEEL DOWN AND
PRAY FOR HER
AND YOU REFUSED
THERE IS SOMETHING SINISTER IN YOU
HE BROKE OFF AND LATHERED AGAIN LIGHTLY HIS FARTHER CHEEK
A TOLERANT
SMILE CURLED HIS LIPS
BUT A LOVELY MUMMER HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF
KINCH THE LOVELIEST
MUMMER OF THEM ALL
HE SHAVED EVENLY AND WITH CARE IN SILENCE SERIOUSLY
STEPHEN AN ELBOW RESTED ON THE JAGGED GRANITE LEANED HIS PALM AGAINST
HIS BROW AND GAZED AT THE FRAYING EDGE OF HIS SHINY BLACK COAT SLEEVE
PAIN THAT WAS NOT YET THE PAIN OF LOVE FRETTED HIS HEART
SILENTLY IN
A DREAM SHE HAD COME TO HIM AFTER HER DEATH HER WASTED BODY WITHIN ITS
LOOSE BROWN GRAVECLOTHES GIVING OFF AN ODOUR OF WAX AND ROSEWOOD HER
BREATH THAT HAD BENT UPON HIM MUTE REPROACHFUL A FAINT ODOUR OF
WETTED ASHES
ACROSS THE THREADBARE CUFFEDGE HE SAW THE SEA HAILED AS A
GREAT SWEET MOTHER BY THE WELLFED VOICE BESIDE HIM
THE RING OF BAY
AND SKYLINE HELD A DULL GREEN MASS OF LIQUID
A BOWL OF WHITE CHINA HAD
STOOD BESIDE HER DEATHBED HOLDING THE GREEN SLUGGISH BILE WHICH SHE HAD
TORN UP FROM HER ROTTING LIVER BY FITS OF LOUD GROANING VOMITING
BUCK MULLIGAN WIPED AGAIN HIS RAZORBLADE

I CAN'T WEAR THEM IF THEY ARE GREY
HE CAN'T WEAR THEM BUCK MULLIGAN TOLD HIS FACE IN THE MIRROR
ETIQUETTE IS ETIQUETTE
HE KILLS HIS MOTHER BUT HE CAN'T WEAR GREY
TROUSERS
HE FOLDED HIS RAZOR NEATLY AND WITH STROKING PALPS OF FINGERS FELT THE
SMOOTH SKIN
STEPHEN TURNED HIS GAZE FROM THE SEA AND TO THE PLUMP FACE WITH ITS
SMOKEBLUE MOBILE EYES
THAT FELLOW I WAS WITH IN THE SHIP LAST NIGHT SAID BUCK MULLIGAN

HE'S UP IN DOTTYVILLE WITH CONNOLLY NORMAN
GENERAL
PARALYSIS OF THE INSANE
HE SWEPT THE MIRROR A HALF CIRCLE IN THE AIR TO FLASH THE TIDINGS ABROAD

HIS CURLING SHAVEN LIPS LAUGHED AND
THE EDGES OF HIS WHITE GLITTERING TEETH
LAUGHTER SEIZED ALL HIS STRONG
WELLKNIT TRUNK
LOOK AT YOURSELF HE SAID YOU DREADFUL BARD

A CROOKED CRACK
HAIR ON END
AS HE AND OTHERS SEE ME
WHO CHOSE THIS
FACE FOR ME THIS DOGSBODY TO RID OF VERMIN

THE AUNT ALWAYS KEEPS PLAINLOOKING SERVANTS FOR MALACHI
LEAD

AND HER NAME IS URSULA
LAUGHING AGAIN HE BROUGHT THE MIRROR AWAY FROM STEPHEN'S PEERING EYES

IF
WILDE WERE ONLY ALIVE TO SEE YOU
DRAWING BACK AND POINTING STEPHEN SAID WITH BITTERNESS
IT IS A SYMBOL OF IRISH ART
THE CRACKED LOOKING GLASS OF A SERVANT
BUCK MULLIGAN SUDDENLY LINKED HIS ARM IN STEPHEN'S AND WALKED WITH HIM

HAD THRUST THEM
IT'S NOT FAIR TO TEASE YOU LIKE THAT KINCH IS IT HE SAID KINDLY

THE
COLD STEELPEN
CRACKED LOOKINGGLASS OF A SERVANT TELL THAT TO THE OXY CHAP
DOWNSTAIRS AND TOUCH HIM FOR A GUINEA

JALAP TO ZULUS OR SOME BLOODY SWINDLE OR OTHER
GOD KINCH IF YOU AND I
COULD ONLY WORK TOGETHER WE MIGHT DO SOMETHING FOR THE ISLAND
HELLENISE

RIBBONS OF HIS SHIRT WHIPPING THE AIR HE HOPS AND HOBBLES ROUND THE
TABLE WITH TROUSERS DOWN AT HEELS CHASED BY ADES OF MAGDALEN WITH THE
TAILOR'S SHEARS
A SCARED CALF'S FACE GILDED WITH MARMALADE
I DON'T
WANT TO BE DEBAGGED DON'T YOU PLAY THE GIDDY OX WITH ME
SHOUTS FROM THE OPEN WINDOW STARTLING EVENING IN THE QUADRANGLE
A DEAF

ON THE SOMBRE LAWN WATCHING NARROWLY THE DANCING MOTES OF GRASSHALMS
TO OURSELVES
NEW PAGANISM
OMPHALOS

THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM EXCEPT AT
NIGHT
THEN WHAT IS IT BUCK MULLIGAN ASKED IMPATIENTLY
COUGH IT UP
I'M
QUITE FRANK WITH YOU
WHAT HAVE YOU AGAINST ME NOW
THEY HALTED LOOKING TOWARDS THE BLUNT CAPE OF BRAY HEAD THAT LAY ON THE
WATER LIKE THE SNOUT OF A SLEEPING WHALE
STEPHEN FREED HIS ARM QUIETLY
DO YOU WISH ME TO TELL YOU HE ASKED
YES WHAT IS IT BUCK MULLIGAN ANSWERED
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
HE LOOKED IN STEPHEN'S FACE AS HE SPOKE
A LIGHT WIND PASSED HIS BROW
FANNING SOFTLY HIS FAIR UNCOMBED HAIR AND STIRRING SILVER POINTS OF
ANXIETY IN HIS EYES
STEPHEN DEPRESSED BY HIS OWN VOICE SAID
DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY I WENT TO YOUR HOUSE AFTER MY MOTHER'S
DEATH
BUCK MULLIGAN FROWNED QUICKLY AND SAID
WHAT WHERE I CAN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
I REMEMBER ONLY IDEAS AND
SENSATIONS
WHY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NAME OF GOD
YOU WERE MAKING TEA STEPHEN SAID AND WENT ACROSS THE LANDING TO
GET MORE HOT WATER
YOUR MOTHER AND SOME VISITOR CAME OUT OF THE
DRAWINGROOM
SHE ASKED YOU WHO WAS IN YOUR ROOM
YES BUCK MULLIGAN SAID
WHAT DID I SAY I FORGET
YOU SAID STEPHEN ANSWERED O IT'S ONLY DEDALUS WHOSE MOTHER IS
BEASTLY DEAD
A FLUSH WHICH MADE HIM SEEM YOUNGER AND MORE ENGAGING ROSE TO BUCK
MULLIGAN'S CHEEK
DID I SAY THAT HE ASKED
WELL WHAT HARM IS THAT
HE SHOOK HIS CONSTRAINT FROM HIM NERVOUSLY
AND WHAT IS DEATH HE ASKED YOUR MOTHER'S OR YOURS OR MY OWN YOU
SAW ONLY YOUR MOTHER DIE
I SEE THEM POP OFF EVERY DAY IN THE MATER AND
RICHMOND AND CUT UP INTO TRIPES IN THE DISSECTINGROOM
IT'S A BEASTLY
THING AND NOTHING ELSE
IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MATTER
YOU WOULDN'T KNEEL
DOWN TO PRAY FOR YOUR MOTHER ON HER DEATHBED WHEN SHE ASKED YOU
WHY
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE CURSED JESUIT STRAIN IN YOU ONLY IT'S INJECTED THE
WRONG WAY
TO ME IT'S ALL A MOCKERY AND BEASTLY
HER CEREBRAL LOBES
ARE NOT FUNCTIONING
SHE CALLS THE DOCTOR SIR PETER TEAZLE AND PICKS
BUTTERCUPS OFF THE QUILT
HUMOUR HER TILL IT'S OVER
YOU CROSSED HER
LAST WISH IN DEATH AND YET YOU SULK WITH ME BECAUSE I DON'T WHINGE LIKE
SOME HIRED MUTE FROM LALOUETTE'S
ABSURD I SUPPOSE I DID SAY IT
I
DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND THE MEMORY OF YOUR MOTHER
HE HAD SPOKEN HIMSELF INTO BOLDNESS
STEPHEN SHIELDING THE GAPING
WOUNDS WHICH THE WORDS HAD LEFT IN HIS HEART SAID VERY COLDLY
I AM NOT THINKING OF THE OFFENCE TO MY MOTHER
OF WHAT THEN BUCK MULLIGAN ASKED
OF THE OFFENCE TO ME STEPHEN ANSWERED
BUCK MULLIGAN SWUNG ROUND ON HIS HEEL
O AN IMPOSSIBLE PERSON HE EXCLAIMED
HE WALKED OFF QUICKLY ROUND THE PARAPET
STEPHEN STOOD AT HIS POST
GAZING OVER THE CALM SEA TOWARDS THE HEADLAND
SEA AND HEADLAND NOW GREW
DIM
PULSES WERE BEATING IN HIS EYES VEILING THEIR SIGHT AND HE FELT
THE FEVER OF HIS CHEEKS
A VOICE WITHIN THE TOWER CALLED LOUDLY
ARE YOU UP THERE MULLIGAN
I'M COMING BUCK MULLIGAN ANSWERED
HE TURNED TOWARDS STEPHEN AND SAID
LOOK AT THE SEA
WHAT DOES IT CARE ABOUT OFFENCES CHUCK LOYOLA
KINCH AND COME ON DOWN
THE SASSENACH WANTS HIS MORNING RASHERS
HIS HEAD HALTED AGAIN FOR A MOMENT AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE LEVEL
WITH THE ROOF
DON'T MOPE OVER IT ALL DAY HE SAID
I'M INCONSEQUENT
GIVE UP THE
MOODY BROODING
HIS HEAD VANISHED BUT THE DRONE OF HIS DESCENDING VOICE BOOMED OUT OF
THE STAIRHEAD
AND NO MORE TURN ASIDE AND BROOD
UPON LOVE'S BITTER MYSTERY
FOR FERGUS RULES THE BRAZEN CARS
WOODSHADOWS FLOATED SILENTLY BY THROUGH THE MORNING PEACE FROM THE
STAIRHEAD SEAWARD WHERE HE GAZED
INSHORE AND FARTHER OUT THE MIRROR OF
WATER WHITENED SPURNED BY LIGHTSHOD HURRYING FEET
WHITE BREAST OF
THE DIM SEA
THE TWINING STRESSES TWO BY TWO
A HAND PLUCKING THE
HARPSTRINGS MERGING THEIR TWINING CHORDS
WAVEWHITE WEDDED WORDS
SHIMMERING ON THE DIM TIDE
A CLOUD BEGAN TO COVER THE SUN SLOWLY WHOLLY SHADOWING THE BAY IN
DEEPER GREEN
IT LAY BENEATH HIM A BOWL OF BITTER WATERS
FERGUS' SONG
I SANG IT ALONE IN THE HOUSE HOLDING DOWN THE LONG DARK CHORDS
HER
DOOR WAS OPEN SHE WANTED TO HEAR MY MUSIC
SILENT WITH AWE AND PITY

FOLDED AWAY IN THE MEMORY OF NATURE WITH HER TOYS
MEMORIES BESET HIS
BROODING BRAIN
HER GLASS OF WATER FROM THE KITCHEN TAP WHEN SHE HAD
APPROACHED THE SACRAMENT
A CORED APPLE FILLED WITH BROWN SUGAR
ROASTING FOR HER AT THE HOB ON A DARK AUTUMN EVENING
HER SHAPELY
FINGERNAILS REDDENED BY THE BLOOD OF SQUASHED LICE FROM THE CHILDREN'S
SHIRTS
IN A DREAM SILENTLY SHE HAD COME TO HIM HER WASTED BODY WITHIN ITS
LOOSE GRAVECLOTHES GIVING OFF AN ODOUR OF WAX AND ROSEWOOD HER BREATH
BENT OVER HIM WITH MUTE SECRET WORDS A FAINT ODOUR OF WETTED ASHES
HER GLAZING EYES STARING OUT OF DEATH TO SHAKE AND BEND MY SOUL
ON ME
ALONE

THAT REMINDS ME HAINES SAID RISING THAT I HAVE TO VISIT YOUR
NATIONAL LIBRARY TODAY
OUR SWIM FIRST BUCK MULLIGAN SAID
HE TURNED TO STEPHEN AND ASKED BLANDLY
IS THIS THE DAY FOR YOUR MONTHLY WASH KINCH
THEN HE SAID TO HAINES
THE UNCLEAN BARD MAKES A POINT OF WASHING ONCE A MONTH
ALL IRELAND IS WASHED BY THE GULFSTREAM STEPHEN SAID AS HE LET HONEY
TRICKLE OVER A SLICE OF THE LOAF
HAINES FROM THE CORNER WHERE HE WAS KNOTTING EASILY A SCARF ABOUT THE
LOOSE COLLAR OF HIS TENNIS SHIRT SPOKE
I INTEND TO MAKE A COLLECTION OF YOUR SAYINGS IF YOU WILL LET ME
SPEAKING TO ME
THEY WASH AND TUB AND SCRUB
AGENBITE OF INWIT
CONSCIENCE
YET HERE'S A SPOT
THAT ONE ABOUT THE CRACKED LOOKINGGLASS OF A SERVANT BEING THE SYMBOL
OF IRISH ART IS DEUCED GOOD
BUCK MULLIGAN KICKED STEPHEN'S FOOT UNDER THE TABLE AND SAID WITH WARMTH
OF TONE
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR HIM ON HAMLET HAINES
WELL I MEAN IT HAINES SAID STILL SPEAKING TO STEPHEN
I WAS JUST
THINKING OF IT WHEN THAT POOR OLD CREATURE CAME IN
WOULD I MAKE ANY MONEY BY IT STEPHEN ASKED
HAINES LAUGHED AND AS HE TOOK HIS SOFT GREY HAT FROM THE HOLDFAST OF
THE HAMMOCK SAID
I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE
HE STROLLED OUT TO THE DOORWAY
BUCK MULLIGAN BENT ACROSS TO STEPHEN AND
SAID WITH COARSE VIGOUR
YOU PUT YOUR HOOF IN IT NOW
WHAT DID YOU SAY THAT FOR
WELL STEPHEN SAID
THE PROBLEM IS TO GET MONEY
FROM WHOM FROM THE
MILKWOMAN OR FROM HIM
IT'S A TOSS UP I THINK
I BLOW HIM OUT ABOUT YOU BUCK MULLIGAN SAID AND THEN YOU COME ALONG
WITH YOUR LOUSY LEER AND YOUR GLOOMY JESUIT JIBES
I SEE LITTLE HOPE STEPHEN SAID FROM HER OR FROM HIM
BUCK MULLIGAN SIGHED TRAGICALLY AND LAID HIS HAND ON STEPHEN'S ARM
FROM ME KINCH HE SAID
IN A SUDDENLY CHANGED TONE HE ADDED
TO TELL YOU THE GOD'S TRUTH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
DAMN ALL ELSE THEY
ARE GOOD FOR
WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THEM AS I DO TO HELL WITH THEM ALL
LET US GET OUT OF THE KIP
HE STOOD UP GRAVELY UNGIRDLED AND DISROBED HIMSELF OF HIS GOWN SAYING
RESIGNEDLY
MULLIGAN IS STRIPPED OF HIS GARMENTS
HE EMPTIED HIS POCKETS ON TO THE TABLE
THERE'S YOUR SNOTRAG HE SAID
AND PUTTING ON HIS STIFF COLLAR AND REBELLIOUS TIE HE SPOKE TO THEM
CHIDING THEM AND TO HIS DANGLING WATCHCHAIN
HIS HANDS PLUNGED AND
RUMMAGED IN HIS TRUNK WHILE HE CALLED FOR A CLEAN HANDKERCHIEF
GOD
WE'LL SIMPLY HAVE TO DRESS THE CHARACTER
I WANT PUCE GLOVES AND
GREEN BOOTS
CONTRADICTION
DO I CONTRADICT MYSELF VERY WELL THEN I
CONTRADICT MYSELF
MERCURIAL MALACHI
A LIMP BLACK MISSILE FLEW OUT OF
HIS TALKING HANDS
AND THERE'S YOUR LATIN QUARTER HAT HE SAID
STEPHEN PICKED IT UP AND PUT IT ON
HAINES CALLED TO THEM FROM THE
DOORWAY
ARE YOU COMING YOU FELLOWS
I'M READY BUCK MULLIGAN ANSWERED GOING TOWARDS THE DOOR
COME OUT
KINCH
YOU HAVE EATEN ALL WE LEFT I SUPPOSE
RESIGNED HE PASSED OUT
WITH GRAVE WORDS AND GAIT SAYING WELLNIGH WITH SORROW
AND GOING FORTH HE MET BUTTERLY
STEPHEN TAKING HIS ASHPLANT FROM ITS LEANINGPLACE FOLLOWED THEM OUT
AND AS THEY WENT DOWN THE LADDER PULLED TO THE SLOW IRON DOOR AND
LOCKED IT
HE PUT THE HUGE KEY IN HIS INNER POCKET
AT THE FOOT OF THE LADDER BUCK MULLIGAN ASKED
DID YOU BRING THE KEY
I HAVE IT STEPHEN SAID PRECEDING THEM
HE WALKED ON
BEHIND HIM HE HEARD BUCK MULLIGAN CLUB WITH HIS HEAVY
BATHTOWEL THE LEADER SHOOTS OF FERNS OR GRASSES
DOWN SIR HOW DARE YOU SIR
HAINES ASKED
DO YOU PAY RENT FOR THIS TOWER
TWELVE QUID BUCK MULLIGAN SAID
TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR STEPHEN ADDED OVER HIS SHOULDER
THEY HALTED WHILE HAINES SURVEYED THE TOWER AND SAID AT LAST
RATHER BLEAK IN WINTERTIME I SHOULD SAY
MARTELLO YOU CALL IT
BILLY PITT HAD THEM BUILT BUCK MULLIGAN SAID WHEN THE FRENCH WERE ON
THE SEA
BUT OURS IS THE OMPHALOS
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF HAMLET HAINES ASKED STEPHEN
NO NO BUCK MULLIGAN SHOUTED IN PAIN
I'M NOT EQUAL TO THOMAS AQUINAS
AND THE FIFTYFIVE REASONS HE HAS MADE OUT TO PROP IT UP
WAIT TILL I
HAVE A FEW PINTS IN ME FIRST
HE TURNED TO STEPHEN SAYING AS HE PULLED DOWN NEATLY THE PEAKS OF HIS
PRIMROSE WAISTCOAT
YOU COULDN'T MANAGE IT UNDER THREE PINTS KINCH COULD YOU
IT HAS WAITED SO LONG STEPHEN SAID LISTLESSLY IT CAN WAIT LONGER
YOU PIQUE MY CURIOSITY HAINES SAID AMIABLY
IS IT SOME PARADOX
POOH BUCK MULLIGAN SAID
WE HAVE GROWN OUT OF WILDE AND PARADOXES
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE
HE PROVES BY ALGEBRA THAT HAMLET'S GRANDSON IS
SHAKESPEARE'S GRANDFATHER AND THAT HE HIMSELF IS THE GHOST OF HIS OWN
FATHER
WHAT HAINES SAID BEGINNING TO POINT AT STEPHEN
HE HIMSELF
BUCK MULLIGAN SLUNG HIS TOWEL STOLEWISE ROUND HIS NECK AND BENDING IN
LOOSE LAUGHTER SAID TO STEPHEN'S EAR
O SHADE OF KINCH THE ELDER JAPHET IN SEARCH OF A FATHER
WE'RE ALWAYS TIRED IN THE MORNING STEPHEN SAID TO HAINES
AND IT IS
RATHER LONG TO TELL
BUCK MULLIGAN WALKING FORWARD AGAIN RAISED HIS HANDS
THE SACRED PINT ALONE CAN UNBIND THE TONGUE OF DEDALUS HE SAID
I MEAN TO SAY HAINES EXPLAINED TO STEPHEN AS THEY FOLLOWED THIS
TOWER AND THESE CLIFFS HERE REMIND ME SOMEHOW OF ELSINORE
THAT BEETLES
O'ER HIS BASE INTO THE SEA ISN'T IT
BUCK MULLIGAN TURNED SUDDENLY FOR AN INSTANT TOWARDS STEPHEN BUT DID
NOT SPEAK
IN THE BRIGHT SILENT INSTANT STEPHEN SAW HIS OWN IMAGE IN
CHEAP DUSTY MOURNING BETWEEN THEIR GAY ATTIRES
IT'S A WONDERFUL TALE HAINES SAID BRINGING THEM TO HALT AGAIN
EYES PALE AS THE SEA THE WIND HAD FRESHENED PALER FIRM AND PRUDENT
THE SEAS' RULER HE GAZED SOUTHWARD OVER THE BAY EMPTY SAVE FOR THE
SMOKEPLUME OF THE MAILBOAT VAGUE ON THE BRIGHT SKYLINE AND A SAIL
TACKING BY THE MUGLINS
I READ A THEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF IT SOMEWHERE HE SAID BEMUSED
THE FATHER AND THE SON IDEA
THE SON STRIVING TO BE ATONED WITH THE
FATHER
BUCK MULLIGAN AT ONCE PUT ON A BLITHE BROADLY SMILING FACE
HE LOOKED
AT THEM HIS WELLSHAPED MOUTH OPEN HAPPILY HIS EYES FROM WHICH HE HAD
SUDDENLY WITHDRAWN ALL SHREWD SENSE BLINKING WITH MAD GAIETY
HE MOVED
A DOLL'S HEAD TO AND FRO THE BRIMS OF HIS PANAMA HAT QUIVERING AND
BEGAN TO CHANT IN A QUIET HAPPY FOOLISH VOICE
I'M THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD
MY MOTHER'S A JEW MY FATHER'S A BIRD
WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE
SO HERE'S TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARY
HE HELD UP A FOREFINGER OF WARNING
IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMN'T DIVINE
HE'LL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN I'M MAKING THE WINE
BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN
THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAIN
HE TUGGED SWIFTLY AT STEPHEN'S ASHPLANT IN FAREWELL AND RUNNING FORWARD
TO A BROW OF THE CLIFF FLUTTERED HIS HANDS AT HIS SIDES LIKE FINS OR
WINGS OF ONE ABOUT TO RISE IN THE AIR AND CHANTED
GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID
AND TELL TOM DICK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD
WHAT'S BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY
AND OLIVET'S BREEZY
GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE
HE CAPERED BEFORE THEM DOWN TOWARDS THE FORTYFOOT HOLE FLUTTERING HIS
WINGLIKE HANDS LEAPING NIMBLY MERCURY'S HAT QUIVERING IN THE FRESH
WIND THAT BORE BACK TO THEM HIS BRIEF BIRDSWEET CRIES
HAINES WHO HAD BEEN LAUGHING GUARDEDLY WALKED ON BESIDE STEPHEN AND
SAID
WE OUGHTN'T TO LAUGH I SUPPOSE
HE'S RATHER BLASPHEMOUS
I'M NOT A
BELIEVER MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY
STILL HIS GAIETY TAKES THE HARM OUT OF
IT SOMEHOW DOESN'T IT WHAT DID HE CALL IT JOSEPH THE JOINER
THE BALLAD OF JOKING JESUS STEPHEN ANSWERED
O HAINES SAID YOU HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE
THREE TIMES A DAY AFTER MEALS STEPHEN SAID DRILY
YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER ARE YOU HAINES ASKED
I MEAN A BELIEVER IN
THE NARROW SENSE OF THE WORD
CREATION FROM NOTHING AND MIRACLES AND A
PERSONAL GOD
THERE'S ONLY ONE SENSE OF THE WORD IT SEEMS TO ME STEPHEN SAID
HAINES STOPPED TO TAKE OUT A SMOOTH SILVER CASE IN WHICH TWINKLED A
GREEN STONE
HE SPRANG IT OPEN WITH HIS THUMB AND OFFERED IT
THANK YOU STEPHEN SAID TAKING A CIGARETTE
HAINES HELPED HIMSELF AND SNAPPED THE CASE TO
HE PUT IT BACK IN HIS
SIDEPOCKET AND TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOATPOCKET A NICKEL TINDERBOX SPRANG
IT OPEN TOO AND HAVING LIT HIS CIGARETTE HELD THE FLAMING SPUNK
TOWARDS STEPHEN IN THE SHELL OF HIS HANDS
YES OF COURSE HE SAID AS THEY WENT ON AGAIN
EITHER YOU BELIEVE
OR YOU DON'T ISN'T IT PERSONALLY I COULDN'T STOMACH THAT IDEA OF A
PERSONAL GOD
YOU DON'T STAND FOR THAT I SUPPOSE
YOU BEHOLD IN ME STEPHEN SAID WITH GRIM DISPLEASURE A HORRIBLE
EXAMPLE OF FREE THOUGHT
HE WALKED ON WAITING TO BE SPOKEN TO TRAILING HIS ASHPLANT BY HIS
SIDE
ITS FERRULE FOLLOWED LIGHTLY ON THE PATH SQUEALING AT HIS HEELS
MY FAMILIAR AFTER ME CALLING STEEEEEEEEEEEEPHEN A WAVERING LINE
ALONG THE PATH
THEY WILL WALK ON IT TONIGHT COMING HERE IN THE DARK
HE WANTS THAT KEY
IT IS MINE
I PAID THE RENT

EYES

YOU ARE YOUR
OWN MASTER IT SEEMS TO ME
I AM A SERVANT OF TWO MASTERS STEPHEN SAID AN ENGLISH AND AN
ITALIAN
ITALIAN HAINES SAID

MR DEASY STARED STERNLY FOR SOME MOMENTS OVER THE MANTELPIECE AT THE
SHAPELY BULK OF A MAN IN TARTAN FILIBEGS ALBERT EDWARD PRINCE OF
WALES
YOU THINK ME AN OLD FOGEY AND AN OLD TORY HIS THOUGHTFUL VOICE SAID
I SAW THREE GENERATIONS SINCE O'CONNELL'S TIME

UNION TWENTY YEARS BEFORE O'CONNELL DID OR BEFORE THE PRELATES OF YOUR
COMMUNION DENOUNCED HIM AS A DEMAGOGUE YOU FENIANS FORGET SOME THINGS

HE PEERED FROM UNDER HIS SHAGGY BROWS AT THE MANUSCRIPT BY HIS ELBOW
AND MUTTERING BEGAN TO PROD THE STIFF BUTTONS OF THE KEYBOARD SLOWLY
SOMETIMES BLOWING AS HE SCREWED UP THE DRUM TO ERASE AN ERROR

HE RAISED HIS FOREFINGER AND BEAT THE AIR OLDLY BEFORE HIS VOICE SPOKE
MARK MY WORDS MR DEDALUS HE SAID
ENGLAND IS IN THE HANDS OF THE
JEWS
IN ALL THE HIGHEST PLACES HER FINANCE HER PRESS
AND THEY ARE
THE SIGNS OF A NATION'S DECAY
WHEREVER THEY GATHER THEY EAT UP THE
NATION'S VITAL STRENGTH
I HAVE SEEN IT COMING THESE YEARS
AS SURE
AS WE ARE STANDING HERE THE JEW MERCHANTS ARE ALREADY AT THEIR WORK OF
DESTRUCTION
OLD ENGLAND IS DYING
HE STEPPED SWIFTLY OFF HIS EYES COMING TO BLUE LIFE AS THEY PASSED A
BROAD SUNBEAM
HE FACED ABOUT AND BACK AGAIN
DYING HE SAID AGAIN IF NOT DEAD BY NOW
THE HARLOT'S CRY FROM STREET TO STREET
SHALL WEAVE OLD ENGLAND'S WINDINGSHEET
HIS EYES OPEN WIDE IN VISION STARED STERNLY ACROSS THE SUNBEAM IN WHICH
HE HALTED
A MERCHANT STEPHEN SAID IS ONE WHO BUYS CHEAP AND SELLS DEAR JEW OR
GENTILE IS HE NOT
THEY SINNED AGAINST THE LIGHT MR DEASY SAID GRAVELY
AND YOU CAN SEE
THE DARKNESS IN THEIR EYES
AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE WANDERERS ON THE
EARTH TO THIS DAY
ON THE STEPS OF THE PARIS STOCK EXCHANGE THE GOLDSKINNED MEN QUOTING
PRICES ON THEIR GEMMED FINGERS
GABBLE OF GEESE
THEY SWARMED LOUD
UNCOUTH ABOUT THE TEMPLE THEIR HEADS THICKPLOTTING UNDER MALADROIT SILK
HATS
NOT THEIRS THESE CLOTHES THIS SPEECH THESE GESTURES
THEIR FULL
SLOW EYES BELIED THE WORDS THE GESTURES EAGER AND UNOFFENDING BUT
KNEW THE RANCOURS MASSED ABOUT THEM AND KNEW THEIR ZEAL WAS VAIN
VAIN
PATIENCE TO HEAP AND HOARD
TIME SURELY WOULD SCATTER ALL
A HOARD
HEAPED BY THE ROADSIDE PLUNDERED AND PASSING ON
THEIR EYES KNEW THEIR
YEARS OF WANDERING AND PATIENT KNEW THE DISHONOURS OF THEIR FLESH
WHO HAS NOT STEPHEN SAID
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MR DEASY ASKED
HE CAME FORWARD A PACE AND STOOD BY THE TABLE
HIS UNDERJAW FELL
SIDEWAYS OPEN UNCERTAINLY
IS THIS OLD WISDOM HE WAITS TO HEAR FROM ME
HISTORY STEPHEN SAID IS A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH I AM TRYING TO AWAKE
FROM THE PLAYFIELD THE BOYS RAISED A SHOUT
A WHIRRING WHISTLE GOAL
WHAT IF THAT NIGHTMARE GAVE YOU A BACK KICK
THE WAYS OF THE CREATOR ARE NOT OUR WAYS MR DEASY SAID
ALL HUMAN
HISTORY MOVES TOWARDS ONE GREAT GOAL THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD
STEPHEN JERKED HIS THUMB TOWARDS THE WINDOW SAYING
THAT IS GOD
HOORAY AY WHRRWHEE
WHAT MR DEASY ASKED
A SHOUT IN THE STREET STEPHEN ANSWERED SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
MR DEASY LOOKED DOWN AND HELD FOR AWHILE THE WINGS OF HIS NOSE TWEAKED
BETWEEN HIS FINGERS
LOOKING UP AGAIN HE SET THEM FREE
I AM HAPPIER THAN YOU ARE HE SAID
WE HAVE COMMITTED MANY ERRORS AND
MANY SINS
A WOMAN BROUGHT SIN INTO THE WORLD
FOR A WOMAN WHO WAS NO
BETTER THAN SHE SHOULD BE HELEN THE RUNAWAY WIFE OF MENELAUS TEN
YEARS THE GREEKS MADE WAR ON TROY
A FAITHLESS WIFE FIRST BROUGHT THE
STRANGERS TO OUR SHORE HERE MACMURROUGH'S WIFE AND HER LEMAN O'ROURKE
PRINCE OF BREFFNI
A WOMAN TOO BROUGHT PARNELL LOW
MANY ERRORS MANY
FAILURES BUT NOT THE ONE SIN
I AM A STRUGGLER NOW AT THE END OF MY

HE FROWNED STERNLY ON THE BRIGHT AIR
WHY SIR STEPHEN ASKED BEGINNING TO SMILE
BECAUSE SHE NEVER LET THEM IN MR DEASY SAID SOLEMNLY
A COUGHBALL OF LAUGHTER LEAPED FROM HIS THROAT DRAGGING AFTER IT A
RATTLING CHAIN OF PHLEGM
HE TURNED BACK QUICKLY COUGHING LAUGHING
HIS LIFTED ARMS WAVING TO THE AIR
SHE NEVER LET THEM IN HE CRIED AGAIN THROUGH HIS LAUGHTER AS HE
STAMPED ON GAITERED FEET OVER THE GRAVEL OF THE PATH

ABOUT ME DON'T ASK
NO THANKS PROFESSOR MACHUGH SAID WAVING THE CIGARETTECASE ASIDE
WAIT A MOMENT
LET ME SAY ONE THING
THE FINEST DISPLAY OF ORATORY I
EVER HEARD WAS A SPEECH MADE BY JOHN F TAYLOR AT THE COLLEGE HISTORICAL
SOCIETY
MR JUSTICE FITZGIBBON THE PRESENT LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL HAD
SPOKEN AND THE PAPER UNDER DEBATE WAS AN ESSAY NEW FOR THOSE DAYS
ADVOCATING THE REVIVAL OF THE IRISH TONGUE
HE TURNED TOWARDS MYLES CRAWFORD AND SAID
YOU KNOW GERALD FITZGIBBON
THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STYLE OF HIS
DISCOURSE
HE IS SITTING WITH TIM HEALY J
J
O'MOLLOY SAID RUMOUR HAS IT ON
THE TRINITY COLLEGE ESTATES COMMISSION
HE IS SITTING WITH A SWEET THING MYLES CRAWFORD SAID IN A CHILD'S
FROCK
GO ON
WELL
IT WAS THE SPEECH MARK YOU THE PROFESSOR SAID OF A FINISHED ORATOR
FULL OF COURTEOUS HAUGHTINESS AND POURING IN CHASTENED DICTION I WILL
NOT SAY THE VIALS OF HIS WRATH BUT POURING THE PROUD MAN'S CONTUMELY
UPON THE NEW MOVEMENT
IT WAS THEN A NEW MOVEMENT
WE WERE WEAK
THEREFORE WORTHLESS
HE CLOSED HIS LONG THIN LIPS AN INSTANT BUT EAGER TO BE ON RAISED
AN OUTSPANNED HAND TO HIS SPECTACLES AND WITH TREMBLING THUMB AND
RINGFINGER TOUCHING LIGHTLY THE BLACK RIMS STEADIED THEM TO A NEW
FOCUS
IMPROMPTU
IN FERIAL TONE HE ADDRESSED J
J
O'MOLLOY
TAYLOR HAD COME THERE YOU MUST KNOW FROM A SICKBED
THAT HE
HAD PREPARED HIS SPEECH I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR THERE WAS NOT EVEN ONE
SHORTHANDWRITER IN THE HALL
HIS DARK LEAN FACE HAD A GROWTH OF SHAGGY
BEARD ROUND IT
HE WORE A LOOSE WHITE SILK NECKCLOTH AND ALTOGETHER HE
LOOKED THOUGH HE WAS NOT A DYING MAN
HIS GAZE TURNED AT ONCE BUT SLOWLY FROM J
J
O'MOLLOY'S TOWARDS
STEPHEN'S FACE AND THEN BENT AT ONCE TO THE GROUND SEEKING
HIS
UNGLAZED LINEN COLLAR APPEARED BEHIND HIS BENT HEAD SOILED BY HIS
WITHERING HAIR
STILL SEEKING HE SAID
WHEN FITZGIBBON'S SPEECH HAD ENDED JOHN F TAYLOR ROSE TO REPLY
BRIEFLY AS WELL AS I CAN BRING THEM TO MIND HIS WORDS WERE THESE
HE RAISED HIS HEAD FIRMLY
HIS EYES BETHOUGHT THEMSELVES ONCE MORE
WITLESS SHELLFISH SWAM IN THE GROSS LENSES TO AND FRO SEEKING OUTLET
HE BEGAN
MR CHAIRMAN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN GREAT WAS MY ADMIRATION IN
LISTENING TO THE REMARKS ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTH OF IRELAND A MOMENT
SINCE BY MY LEARNED FRIEND
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED
INTO A COUNTRY FAR AWAY FROM THIS COUNTRY INTO AN AGE REMOTE FROM
THIS AGE THAT I STOOD IN ANCIENT EGYPT AND THAT I WAS LISTENING TO THE
SPEECH OF SOME HIGHPRIEST OF THAT LAND ADDRESSED TO THE YOUTHFUL MOSES
HIS LISTENERS HELD THEIR CIGARETTES POISED TO HEAR THEIR SMOKES
ASCENDING IN FRAIL STALKS THAT FLOWERED WITH HIS SPEECH
AND LET OUR
CROOKED SMOKES NOBLE WORDS COMING
LOOK OUT
COULD YOU TRY YOUR HAND
AT IT YOURSELF
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HEARD THE VOICE OF THAT EGYPTIAN
HIGHPRIEST RAISED IN A TONE OF LIKE HAUGHTINESS AND LIKE PRIDE
I HEARD
HIS WORDS AND THEIR MEANING WAS REVEALED TO ME
FROM THE FATHERS
IT WAS REVEALED TO ME THAT THOSE THINGS ARE GOOD WHICH YET ARE CORRUPTED
WHICH NEITHER IF THEY WERE SUPREMELY GOOD NOR UNLESS THEY WERE GOOD
COULD BE CORRUPTED
AH CURSE YOU THAT'S SAINT AUGUSTINE

A DUMB BELCH OF HUNGER CLEFT HIS SPEECH
HE LIFTED HIS VOICE ABOVE IT
BOLDLY
BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN HAD THE YOUTHFUL MOSES LISTENED TO AND
ACCEPTED THAT VIEW OF LIFE HAD HE BOWED HIS HEAD AND BOWED HIS WILL
AND BOWED HIS SPIRIT BEFORE THAT ARROGANT ADMONITION HE WOULD NEVER HAVE
BROUGHT THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE OF BONDAGE NOR FOLLOWED
THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD BY DAY
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE
ETERNAL AMID LIGHTNINGS ON SINAI'S MOUNTAINTOP NOR EVER HAVE COME DOWN
WITH THE LIGHT OF INSPIRATION SHINING IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND BEARING IN
HIS ARMS THE TABLES OF THE LAW GRAVEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE OUTLAW
HE CEASED AND LOOKED AT THEM ENJOYING A SILENCE
OMINOUS FOR HIM

OUR YOUNG IRISH BARDS JOHN EGLINTON CENSURED HAVE YET TO CREATE A
FIGURE WHICH THE WORLD WILL SET BESIDE SAXON SHAKESPEARE'S HAMLET THOUGH
I ADMIRE HIM AS OLD BEN DID ON THIS SIDE IDOLATRY
ALL THESE QUESTIONS ARE PURELY ACADEMIC RUSSELL ORACLED OUT OF HIS
SHADOW
I MEAN WHETHER HAMLET IS SHAKESPEARE OR JAMES I OR ESSEX
CLERGYMEN'S DISCUSSIONS OF THE HISTORICITY OF JESUS
ART HAS TO REVEAL
TO US IDEAS FORMLESS SPIRITUAL ESSENCES
THE SUPREME QUESTION ABOUT A
WORK OF ART IS OUT OF HOW DEEP A LIFE DOES IT SPRING
THE PAINTING OF
GUSTAVE MOREAU IS THE PAINTING OF IDEAS
THE DEEPEST POETRY OF SHELLEY
THE WORDS OF HAMLET BRING OUR MINDS INTO CONTACT WITH THE ETERNAL
WISDOM PLATO'S WORLD OF IDEAS
ALL THE REST IS THE SPECULATION OF
SCHOOLBOYS FOR SCHOOLBOYS

ARISTOTLE WAS ONCE PLATO'S SCHOOLBOY

THAT MODEL SCHOOLBOY STEPHEN SAID WOULD FIND HAMLET'S MUSINGS ABOUT
THE AFTERLIFE OF HIS PRINCELY SOUL THE IMPROBABLE INSIGNIFICANT AND
UNDRAMATIC MONOLOGUE AS SHALLOW AS PLATO'S
JOHN EGLINTON FROWNING SAID WAXING WROTH
UPON MY WORD IT MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL TO HEAR ANYONE COMPARE ARISTOTLE
WITH PLATO

GONE
I SMOKED HIS BACCY
GREEN
TWINKLING STONE
AN EMERALD SET IN THE RING OF THE SEA
PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW DANGEROUS LOVESONGS CAN BE THE AURIC EGG OF
RUSSELL WARNED OCCULTLY
THE MOVEMENTS WHICH WORK REVOLUTIONS IN THE
WORLD ARE BORN OUT OF THE DREAMS AND VISIONS IN A PEASANT'S HEART ON THE
HILLSIDE
FOR THEM THE EARTH IS NOT AN EXPLOITABLE GROUND BUT THE
LIVING MOTHER
THE RAREFIED AIR OF THE ACADEMY AND THE ARENA PRODUCE THE
SIXSHILLING NOVEL THE MUSICHALL SONG
FRANCE PRODUCES THE FINEST FLOWER
OF CORRUPTION IN MALLARME BUT THE DESIRABLE LIFE IS REVEALED ONLY TO THE
POOR OF HEART THE LIFE OF HOMER'S PHAEACIANS
FROM THESE WORDS MR BEST TURNED AN UNOFFENDING FACE TO STEPHEN
MALLARME DON'T YOU KNOW HE SAID HAS WRITTEN THOSE WONDERFUL PROSE
POEMS STEPHEN MACKENNA USED TO READ TO ME IN PARIS
THE ONE ABOUT
HAMLET HE SAYS IL SE PROMNE LISANT AU LIVRE DE LUI MME DON'T
YOU KNOW READING THE BOOK OF HIMSELF
HE DESCRIBES HAMLET GIVEN IN
A FRENCH TOWN DON'T YOU KNOW A PROVINCIAL TOWN
THEY ADVERTISED IT

EXCELLENT PEOPLE NO DOUBT BUT
DISTRESSINGLY SHORTSIGHTED IN SOME MATTERS
SUMPTUOUS AND STAGNANT EXAGGERATION OF MURDER
A DEATHSMAN OF THE SOUL ROBERT GREENE CALLED HIM STEPHEN SAID
NOT
FOR NOTHING WAS HE A BUTCHER'S SON WIELDING THE SLEDDED POLEAXE AND
SPITTING IN HIS PALMS
NINE LIVES ARE TAKEN OFF FOR HIS FATHER'S ONE
OUR FATHER WHO ART IN PURGATORY

WHELPS AND DAMS OF MURDEROUS FOES WHOM NONE BUT WE HAD SPARED
BETWEEN THE SAXON SMILE AND YANKEE YAWP
THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA
HE WILL HAVE IT THAT HAMLET IS A GHOSTSTORY JOHN EGLINTON SAID
FOR MR BEST'S BEHOOF
LIKE THE FAT BOY IN PICKWICK HE WANTS TO MAKE OUR
FLESH CREEP
LIST LIST O LIST
MY FLESH HEARS HIM CREEPING HEARS
IF THOU DIDST EVER
WHAT IS A GHOST STEPHEN SAID WITH TINGLING ENERGY
ONE WHO HAS FADED
INTO IMPALPABILITY THROUGH DEATH THROUGH ABSENCE THROUGH CHANGE OF
MANNERS
ELIZABETHAN LONDON LAY AS FAR FROM STRATFORD AS CORRUPT PARIS
LIES FROM VIRGIN DUBLIN
WHO IS THE GHOST FROM LIMBO PATRUM RETURNING
TO THE WORLD THAT HAS FORGOTTEN HIM WHO IS KING HAMLET
JOHN EGLINTON SHIFTED HIS SPARE BODY LEANING BACK TO JUDGE
LIFTED
IT IS THIS HOUR OF A DAY IN MID JUNE STEPHEN SAID BEGGING WITH
A SWIFT GLANCE THEIR HEARING
THE FLAG IS UP ON THE PLAYHOUSE BY THE
BANKSIDE
THE BEAR SACKERSON GROWLS IN THE PIT NEAR IT PARIS GARDEN
CANVASCLIMBERS WHO SAILED WITH DRAKE CHEW THEIR SAUSAGES AMONG THE
GROUNDLINGS
LOCAL COLOUR
WORK IN ALL YOU KNOW
MAKE THEM ACCOMPLICES
SHAKESPEARE HAS LEFT THE HUGUENOT'S HOUSE IN SILVER STREET AND WALKS
BY THE SWANMEWS ALONG THE RIVERBANK
BUT HE DOES NOT STAY TO FEED THE
PEN CHIVYING HER GAME OF CYGNETS TOWARDS THE RUSHES
THE SWAN OF AVON
HAS OTHER THOUGHTS
COMPOSITION OF PLACE
IGNATIUS LOYOLA MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME
THE PLAY BEGINS
A PLAYER COMES ON UNDER THE SHADOW MADE UP IN THE
CASTOFF MAIL OF A COURT BUCK A WELLSET MAN WITH A BASS VOICE
IT IS THE
GHOST THE KING A KING AND NO KING AND THE PLAYER IS SHAKESPEARE WHO
HAS STUDIED HAMLET ALL THE YEARS OF HIS LIFE WHICH WERE NOT VANITY IN
ORDER TO PLAY THE PART OF THE SPECTRE
HE SPEAKS THE WORDS TO BURBAGE
THE YOUNG PLAYER WHO STANDS BEFORE HIM BEYOND THE RACK OF CERECLOTH
CALLING HIM BY A NAME
HAMLET I AM THY FATHER'S SPIRIT
BIDDING HIM LIST
TO A SON HE SPEAKS THE SON OF HIS SOUL THE PRINCE
YOUNG HAMLET AND TO THE SON OF HIS BODY HAMNET SHAKESPEARE WHO HAS
DIED IN STRATFORD THAT HIS NAMESAKE MAY LIVE FOR EVER
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THAT PLAYER SHAKESPEARE A GHOST BY ABSENCE AND IN
THE VESTURE OF BURIED DENMARK A GHOST BY DEATH SPEAKING HIS OWN WORDS
TO HIS OWN SON'S NAME HAD HAMNET SHAKESPEARE LIVED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
PRINCE HAMLET'S TWIN IS IT POSSIBLE I WANT TO KNOW OR PROBABLE THAT
HE DID NOT DRAW OR FORESEE THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THOSE PREMISES YOU
ARE THE DISPOSSESSED SON I AM THE MURDERED FATHER YOUR MOTHER IS THE
GUILTY QUEEN ANN SHAKESPEARE BORN HATHAWAY
BUT THIS PRYING INTO THE FAMILY LIFE OF A GREAT MAN RUSSELL BEGAN
IMPATIENTLY

INTERESTING ONLY TO THE PARISH CLERK
I MEAN WE HAVE THE PLAYS

POET LIVED AS FOR LIVING OUR SERVANTS CAN DO THAT FOR US VILLIERS DE
L'ISLE HAS SAID
PEEPING AND PRYING INTO GREENROOM GOSSIP OF THE DAY
THE POET'S DRINKING THE POET'S DEBTS

JOHN EGLINTON'S CARPING VOICE ASKED
HER GHOST AT LEAST HAS BEEN LAID
FOR EVER
SHE DIED FOR LITERATURE AT LEAST BEFORE SHE WAS BORN
SHE DIED STEPHEN RETORTED SIXTYSEVEN YEARS AFTER SHE WAS BORN
SHE
SAW HIM INTO AND OUT OF THE WORLD
SHE TOOK HIS FIRST EMBRACES
SHE BORE
HIS CHILDREN AND SHE LAID PENNIES ON HIS EYES TO KEEP HIS EYELIDS CLOSED
WHEN HE LAY ON HIS DEATHBED
MOTHER'S DEATHBED

WHO BROUGHT ME INTO
THIS WORLD LIES THERE BRONZELIDDED UNDER FEW CHEAP FLOWERS
LILIATA
RUTILANTIUM
I WEPT ALONE
JOHN EGLINTON LOOKED IN THE TANGLED GLOWWORM OF HIS LAMP
THE WORLD BELIEVES THAT SHAKESPEARE MADE A MISTAKE HE SAID AND GOT
OUT OF IT AS QUICKLY AND AS BEST HE COULD
BOSH STEPHEN SAID RUDELY
A MAN OF GENIUS MAKES NO MISTAKES
HIS
ERRORS ARE VOLITIONAL AND ARE THE PORTALS OF DISCOVERY
PORTALS OF DISCOVERY OPENED TO LET IN THE QUAKER LIBRARIAN
SOFTCREAKFOOTED BALD EARED AND ASSIDUOUS
A SHREW JOHN EGLINTON SAID SHREWDLY IS NOT A USEFUL PORTAL OF
DISCOVERY ONE SHOULD IMAGINE
WHAT USEFUL DISCOVERY DID SOCRATES LEARN
FROM XANTHIPPE
DIALECTIC STEPHEN ANSWERED AND FROM HIS MOTHER HOW TO BRING THOUGHTS
INTO THE WORLD
WHAT HE LEARNT FROM HIS OTHER WIFE MYRTO ABSIT
NOMEN SOCRATIDIDION'S EPIPSYCHIDION NO MAN NOT A WOMAN WILL EVER
KNOW
BUT NEITHER THE MIDWIFE'S LORE NOR THE CAUDLELECTURES SAVED HIM
FROM THE ARCHONS OF SINN FEIN AND THEIR NAGGIN OF HEMLOCK
BUT ANN HATHAWAY MR BEST'S QUIET VOICE SAID FORGETFULLY
YES WE SEEM
TO BE FORGETTING HER AS SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF FORGOT HER
HIS LOOK WENT FROM BROODER'S BEARD TO CARPER'S SKULL TO REMIND TO
CHIDE THEM NOT UNKINDLY THEN TO THE BALDPINK LOLLARD COSTARD GUILTLESS
THOUGH MALIGNED
HE HAD A GOOD GROATSWORTH OF WIT STEPHEN SAID AND NO TRUANT MEMORY
HE CARRIED A MEMORY IN HIS WALLET AS HE TRUDGED TO ROMEVILLE WHISTLING
THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME IF THE EARTHQUAKE DID NOT TIME IT WE SHOULD
KNOW WHERE TO PLACE POOR WAT SITTING IN HIS FORM THE CRY OF HOUNDS
THE STUDDED BRIDLE AND HER BLUE WINDOWS
THAT MEMORY VENUS AND
ADONIS LAY IN THE BEDCHAMBER OF EVERY LIGHT OF LOVE IN LONDON
IS KATHARINE THE SHREW ILLFAVOURED HORTENSIO CALLS HER YOUNG AND
BEAUTIFUL
DO YOU THINK THE WRITER OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA A
PASSIONATE PILGRIM HAD HIS EYES IN THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THAT HE CHOSE
THE UGLIEST DOXY IN ALL WARWICKSHIRE TO LIE WITHAL GOOD HE LEFT HER
AND GAINED THE WORLD OF MEN
BUT HIS BOYWOMEN ARE THE WOMEN OF A BOY
THEIR LIFE THOUGHT SPEECH ARE LENT THEM BY MALES
HE CHOSE BADLY HE
WAS CHOSEN IT SEEMS TO ME
IF OTHERS HAVE THEIR WILL ANN HATH A WAY
BY COCK SHE WAS TO BLAME
SHE PUT THE COMETHER ON HIM SWEET AND
TWENTYSIX
THE GREYEYED GODDESS WHO BENDS OVER THE BOY ADONIS STOOPING
TO CONQUER AS PROLOGUE TO THE SWELLING ACT IS A BOLDFACED STRATFORD

THE QUAKER LIBRARIAN CAME FROM THE LEAVETAKERS
BLUSHING HIS MASK SAID
MR DEDALUS YOUR VIEWS ARE MOST ILLUMINATING
HE CREAKED TO AND FRO TIPTOING UP NEARER HEAVEN BY THE ALTITUDE OF A
CHOPINE AND COVERED BY THE NOISE OF OUTGOING SAID LOW
IS IT YOUR VIEW THEN THAT SHE WAS NOT FAITHFUL TO THE POET
ALARMED FACE ASKS ME
WHY DID HE COME COURTESY OR AN INWARD LIGHT
WHERE THERE IS A RECONCILIATION STEPHEN SAID THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
FIRST A SUNDERING
YES
CHRISTFOX IN LEATHER TREWS HIDING A RUNAWAY IN BLIGHTED TREEFORKS
FROM HUE AND CRY
KNOWING NO VIXEN WALKING LONELY IN THE CHASE
WOMEN
HE WON TO HIM TENDER PEOPLE A WHORE OF BABYLON LADIES OF JUSTICES
BULLY TAPSTERS' WIVES

AND IN NEW PLACE A SLACK
DISHONOURED BODY THAT ONCE WAS COMELY ONCE AS SWEET AS FRESH AS
CINNAMON NOW HER LEAVES FALLING ALL BARE FRIGHTED OF THE NARROW
GRAVE AND UNFORGIVEN
YES
SO YOU THINK
THE DOOR CLOSED BEHIND THE OUTGOER
REST SUDDENLY POSSESSED THE DISCREET VAULTED CELL REST OF WARM AND
BROODING AIR
A VESTAL'S LAMP
HERE HE PONDERS THINGS THAT WERE NOT WHAT CAESAR WOULD HAVE LIVED TO DO
HAD HE BELIEVED THE SOOTHSAYER WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN POSSIBILITIES OF
THE POSSIBLE AS POSSIBLE THINGS NOT KNOWN WHAT NAME ACHILLES BORE WHEN
HE LIVED AMONG WOMEN
COFFINED THOUGHTS AROUND ME IN MUMMYCASES EMBALMED IN SPICE OF WORDS
THOTH GOD OF LIBRARIES A BIRDGOD MOONYCROWNED
AND I HEARD THE
VOICE OF THAT EGYPTIAN HIGHPRIEST
IN PAINTED CHAMBERS LOADED WITH
TILEBOOKS
THEY ARE STILL
ONCE QUICK IN THE BRAINS OF MEN
STILL BUT AN ITCH OF
DEATH IS IN THEM TO TELL ME IN MY EAR A MAUDLIN TALE URGE ME TO WREAK
THEIR WILL
CERTAINLY JOHN EGLINTON MUSED OF ALL GREAT MEN HE IS THE MOST
ENIGMATIC
WE KNOW NOTHING BUT THAT HE LIVED AND SUFFERED
NOT EVEN SO
MUCH
OTHERS ABIDE OUR QUESTION
A SHADOW HANGS OVER ALL THE REST
BUT HAMLET IS SO PERSONAL ISN'T IT MR BEST PLEADED
I MEAN A KIND
OF PRIVATE PAPER DON'T YOU KNOW OF HIS PRIVATE LIFE
I MEAN I DON'T
CARE A BUTTON DON'T YOU KNOW WHO IS KILLED OR WHO IS GUILTY
HE RESTED AN INNOCENT BOOK ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK SMILING HIS
DEFIANCE
HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THE ORIGINAL

PUT BEURLA ON IT LITTLEJOHN
QUOTH LITTLEJOHN EGLINTON
I WAS PREPARED FOR PARADOXES FROM WHAT MALACHI MULLIGAN TOLD US BUT
I MAY AS WELL WARN YOU THAT IF YOU WANT TO SHAKE MY BELIEF THAT
SHAKESPEARE IS HAMLET YOU HAVE A STERN TASK BEFORE YOU
BEAR WITH ME
STEPHEN WITHSTOOD THE BANE OF MISCREANT EYES GLINTING STERN UNDER
WRINKLED BROWS
A BASILISK
E QUANDO VEDE L'UOMO L'ATTOSCA
MESSER
BRUNETTO I THANK THEE FOR THE WORD
AS WE OR MOTHER DANA WEAVE AND UNWEAVE OUR BODIES STEPHEN SAID
FROM DAY TO DAY THEIR MOLECULES SHUTTLED TO AND FRO SO DOES THE ARTIST
WEAVE AND UNWEAVE HIS IMAGE
AND AS THE MOLE ON MY RIGHT BREAST IS WHERE
IT WAS WHEN I WAS BORN THOUGH ALL MY BODY HAS BEEN WOVEN OF NEW STUFF
TIME AFTER TIME SO THROUGH THE GHOST OF THE UNQUIET FATHER THE IMAGE
OF THE UNLIVING SON LOOKS FORTH
IN THE INTENSE INSTANT OF IMAGINATION
WHEN THE MIND SHELLEY SAYS IS A FADING COAL THAT WHICH I WAS IS THAT
WHICH I AM AND THAT WHICH IN POSSIBILITY I MAY COME TO BE
SO IN THE
FUTURE THE SISTER OF THE PAST I MAY SEE MYSELF AS I SIT HERE NOW BUT
BY REFLECTION FROM THAT WHICH THEN I SHALL BE
DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN HELPED YOU AT THAT STILE
YES MR BEST SAID YOUNGLY
I FEEL HAMLET QUITE YOUNG
THE BITTERNESS
MIGHT BE FROM THE FATHER BUT THE PASSAGES WITH OPHELIA ARE SURELY FROM
THE SON
HAS THE WRONG SOW BY THE LUG
HE IS IN MY FATHER
I AM IN HIS SON
THAT MOLE IS THE LAST TO GO STEPHEN SAID LAUGHING
JOHN EGLINTON MADE A NOTHING PLEASING MOW
IF THAT WERE THE BIRTHMARK OF GENIUS HE SAID GENIUS WOULD BE A
DRUG IN THE MARKET
THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE'S LATER YEARS WHICH RENAN
ADMIRED SO MUCH BREATHE ANOTHER SPIRIT
THE SPIRIT OF RECONCILIATION THE QUAKER LIBRARIAN BREATHED
THERE CAN BE NO RECONCILIATION STEPHEN SAID IF THERE HAS NOT BEEN A
SUNDERING
SAID THAT
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE EVENTS WHICH CAST THEIR SHADOW OVER
THE HELL OF TIME OF KING LEAR OTHELLO HAMLET TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
LOOK TO SEE WHEN AND HOW THE SHADOW LIFTS
WHAT SOFTENS THE HEART OF A
MAN SHIPWRECKED IN STORMS DIRE TRIED LIKE ANOTHER ULYSSES PERICLES
PRINCE OF TYRE
HEAD REDCONECAPPED BUFFETED BRINEBLINDED
A CHILD A GIRL PLACED IN HIS ARMS MARINA
THE LEANING OF SOPHISTS TOWARDS THE BYPATHS OF APOCRYPHA IS A CONSTANT
QUANTITY JOHN EGLINTON DETECTED
THE HIGHROADS ARE DREARY BUT THEY LEAD
TO THE TOWN
GOOD BACON GONE MUSTY
SHAKESPEARE BACON'S WILD OATS
CYPHERJUGGLERS
GOING THE HIGHROADS
SEEKERS ON THE GREAT QUEST
WHAT TOWN GOOD

WILL WE BE THERE BY

MR BRANDES ACCEPTS IT STEPHEN SAID AS THE FIRST PLAY OF THE CLOSING
PERIOD
DOES HE WHAT DOES MR SIDNEY LEE OR MR SIMON LAZARUS AS SOME AVER HIS
NAME IS SAY OF IT
MARINA STEPHEN SAID A CHILD OF STORM MIRANDA A WONDER PERDITA
THAT WHICH WAS LOST
WHAT WAS LOST IS GIVEN BACK TO HIM HIS DAUGHTER'S
CHILD
MY DEAREST WIFE PERICLES SAYS WAS LIKE THIS MAID WILL ANY
MAN LOVE THE DAUGHTER IF HE HAS NOT LOVED THE MOTHER
THE ART OF BEING A GRANDFATHER MR BEST GAN MURMUR
L'ART D'TRE
GRAND
WILL HE NOT SEE REBORN IN HER WITH THE MEMORY OF HIS OWN YOUTH ADDED
ANOTHER IMAGE
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT LOVE YES
WORD KNOWN TO ALL
MEN
AMOR VERO ALIQUID ALICUI BONUM VULT UNDE ET EA QUAE CONCUPISCIMUS
HIS OWN IMAGE TO A MAN WITH THAT QUEER THING GENIUS IS THE STANDARD OF
ALL EXPERIENCE MATERIAL AND MORAL
SUCH AN APPEAL WILL TOUCH HIM
THE
IMAGES OF OTHER MALES OF HIS BLOOD WILL REPEL HIM
HE WILL SEE IN THEM
GROTESQUE ATTEMPTS OF NATURE TO FORETELL OR TO REPEAT HIMSELF
THE BENIGN FOREHEAD OF THE QUAKER LIBRARIAN ENKINDLED ROSILY WITH HOPE
I HOPE MR DEDALUS WILL WORK OUT HIS THEORY FOR THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF
THE PUBLIC
AND WE OUGHT TO MENTION ANOTHER IRISH COMMENTATOR MR GEORGE
BERNARD SHAW
NOR SHOULD WE FORGET MR FRANK HARRIS
HIS ARTICLES ON
SHAKESPEARE IN THE SATURDAY REVIEW WERE SURELY BRILLIANT
ODDLY
ENOUGH HE TOO DRAWS FOR US AN UNHAPPY RELATION WITH THE DARK LADY OF THE
SONNETS
THE FAVOURED RIVAL IS WILLIAM HERBERT EARL OF PEMBROKE
I OWN
THAT IF THE POET MUST BE REJECTED SUCH A REJECTION WOULD SEEM MORE IN
HARMONY WITH WHAT SHALL I SAY OUR NOTIONS OF WHAT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE
BEEN
FELICITOUSLY HE CEASED AND HELD A MEEK HEAD AMONG THEM AUK'S EGG PRIZE
OF THEIR FRAY
HE THOUS AND THEES HER WITH GRAVE HUSBANDWORDS
DOST LOVE MIRIAM DOST
LOVE THY MAN
THAT MAY BE TOO STEPHEN SAID
THERE'S A SAYING OF GOETHE'S WHICH MR
MAGEE LIKES TO QUOTE
BEWARE OF WHAT YOU WISH FOR IN YOUTH BECAUSE
YOU WILL GET IT IN MIDDLE LIFE
WHY DOES HE SEND TO ONE WHO IS
A BUONAROBA A BAY WHERE ALL MEN RIDE A MAID OF HONOUR WITH A
SCANDALOUS GIRLHOOD A LORDLING TO WOO FOR HIM HE WAS HIMSELF A LORD
OF LANGUAGE AND HAD MADE HIMSELF A COISTREL GENTLEMAN AND HE HAD WRITTEN
ROMEO AND JULIET
WHY BELIEF IN HIMSELF HAS BEEN UNTIMELY KILLED
HE
WAS OVERBORNE IN A CORNFIELD FIRST RYEFIELD I SHOULD SAY AND HE WILL
NEVER BE A VICTOR IN HIS OWN EYES AFTER NOR PLAY VICTORIOUSLY THE GAME
OF LAUGH AND LIE DOWN
ASSUMED DONGIOVANNISM WILL NOT SAVE HIM
NO LATER
UNDOING WILL UNDO THE FIRST UNDOING
THE TUSK OF THE BOAR HAS WOUNDED
HIM THERE WHERE LOVE LIES ABLEEDING
IF THE SHREW IS WORSTED YET THERE
REMAINS TO HER WOMAN'S INVISIBLE WEAPON
THERE IS I FEEL IN THE WORDS
SOME GOAD OF THE FLESH DRIVING HIM INTO A NEW PASSION A DARKER SHADOW
OF THE FIRST DARKENING EVEN HIS OWN UNDERSTANDING OF HIMSELF
A LIKE
FATE AWAITS HIM AND THE TWO RAGES COMMINGLE IN A WHIRLPOOL
THEY LIST
AND IN THE PORCHES OF THEIR EARS I POUR
THE SOUL HAS BEEN BEFORE STRICKEN MORTALLY A POISON POURED IN THE
PORCH OF A SLEEPING EAR
BUT THOSE WHO ARE DONE TO DEATH IN SLEEP CANNOT
KNOW THE MANNER OF THEIR QUELL UNLESS THEIR CREATOR ENDOW THEIR SOULS
WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE IN THE LIFE TO COME
THE POISONING AND THE BEAST
WITH TWO BACKS THAT URGED IT KING HAMLET'S GHOST COULD NOT KNOW OF WERE
HE NOT ENDOWED WITH KNOWLEDGE BY HIS CREATOR
THAT IS WHY THE SPEECH
HIS LEAN UNLOVELY ENGLISH IS ALWAYS TURNED ELSEWHERE BACKWARD
RAVISHER AND RAVISHED WHAT HE WOULD BUT WOULD NOT GO WITH HIM FROM
LUCRECE'S BLUECIRCLED IVORY GLOBES TO IMOGEN'S BREAST BARE WITH ITS
MOLE CINQUESPOTTED
HE GOES BACK WEARY OF THE CREATION HE HAS PILED UP
TO HIDE HIM FROM HIMSELF AN OLD DOG LICKING AN OLD SORE

TWENTY YEARS HE DALLIED
THERE BETWEEN CONJUGIAL LOVE AND ITS CHASTE DELIGHTS AND SCORTATORY LOVE
AND ITS FOUL PLEASURES
YOU KNOW MANNINGHAM'S STORY OF THE BURGHER'S
WIFE WHO BADE DICK BURBAGE TO HER BED AFTER SHE HAD SEEN HIM IN RICHARD

TOOK THE COW BY THE HORNS AND WHEN BURBAGE CAME KNOCKING AT THE GATE

OLD WALL WHERE SUDDEN LIZARDS FLASH
AT CHARENTON I WATCHED THEM
IT SEEMS SO STEPHEN SAID WHEN HE WANTS TO DO FOR HIM AND FOR ALL
OTHER AND SINGULAR UNEARED WOMBS THE HOLY OFFICE AN OSTLER DOES FOR THE
STALLION
MAYBE LIKE SOCRATES HE HAD A MIDWIFE TO MOTHER AS HE HAD A
SHREW TO WIFE
BUT SHE THE GIGLOT WANTON DID NOT BREAK A BEDVOW

IF YOU
DENY THAT IN THE FIFTH SCENE OF HAMLET HE HAS BRANDED HER WITH INFAMY
TELL ME WHY THERE IS NO MENTION OF HER DURING THE THIRTYFOUR YEARS
BETWEEN THE DAY SHE MARRIED HIM AND THE DAY SHE BURIED HIM
ALL THOSE
WOMEN SAW THEIR MEN DOWN AND UNDER MARY HER GOODMAN JOHN ANN HER
POOR DEAR WILLUN WHEN HE WENT AND DIED ON HER RAGING THAT HE WAS THE
FIRST TO GO JOAN HER FOUR BROTHERS JUDITH HER HUSBAND AND ALL HER

GRANDDADDY'S WORDS WED HER SECOND HAVING KILLED HER FIRST
O YES MENTION THERE IS
IN THE YEARS WHEN HE WAS LIVING RICHLY IN
ROYAL LONDON TO PAY A DEBT SHE HAD TO BORROW FORTY SHILLINGS FROM HER
FATHER'S SHEPHERD
EXPLAIN YOU THEN
EXPLAIN THE SWANSONG TOO WHEREIN HE
HAS COMMENDED HER TO POSTERITY
HE FACED THEIR SILENCE
TO WHOM THUS EGLINTON
YOU MEAN THE WILL
BUT THAT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED I BELIEVE BY JURISTS
SHE WAS ENTITLED TO HER WIDOW'S DOWER
AT COMMON LAW
HIS LEGAL KNOWLEDGE WAS GREAT
OUR JUDGES TELL US
HIM SATAN FLEERS
MOCKER
AND THEREFORE HE LEFT OUT HER NAME
FROM THE FIRST DRAFT BUT HE DID NOT LEAVE OUT
THE PRESENTS FOR HIS GRANDDAUGHTER FOR HIS DAUGHTERS
FOR HIS SISTER FOR HIS OLD CRONIES IN STRATFORD
AND IN LONDON

MR BEST EAGERQUIETLY LIFTED HIS BOOK TO SAY
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THAT BROTHER MOTIVE DON'T YOU KNOW
WE FIND ALSO IN THE OLD IRISH MYTHS
JUST WHAT YOU SAY
THE THREE
BROTHERS SHAKESPEARE
IN GRIMM TOO DON'T YOU KNOW THE FAIRYTALES
THE
THIRD BROTHER THAT ALWAYS MARRIES THE SLEEPING BEAUTY AND WINS THE BEST
PRIZE
BEST OF BEST BROTHERS
GOOD BETTER BEST
THE QUAKER LIBRARIAN SPRINGHALTED NEAR
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HE SAID WHICH BROTHER YOU
I UNDERSTAND YOU
TO SUGGEST THERE WAS MISCONDUCT WITH ONE OF THE BROTHERS
BUT PERHAPS
I AM ANTICIPATING
HE CAUGHT HIMSELF IN THE ACT LOOKED AT ALL REFRAINED
AN ATTENDANT FROM THE DOORWAY CALLED
MR LYSTER FATHER DINEEN WANTS
O FATHER DINEEN DIRECTLY
SWIFTLY RECTLY CREAKING RECTLY RECTLY HE WAS RECTLY GONE
JOHN EGLINTON TOUCHED THE FOIL
COME HE SAID
LET US HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY OF RICHARD AND EDMUND
YOU KEPT THEM FOR THE LAST DIDN'T YOU
IN ASKING YOU TO REMEMBER THOSE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN NUNCLE RICHIE AND
NUNCLE EDMUND STEPHEN ANSWERED I FEEL I AM ASKING TOO MUCH PERHAPS

LAPWING
I AM TIRED OF MY VOICE THE VOICE OF ESAU
MY KINGDOM FOR A DRINK
ON
YOU WILL SAY THOSE NAMES WERE ALREADY IN THE CHRONICLES FROM WHICH HE
TOOK THE STUFF OF HIS PLAYS
WHY DID HE TAKE THEM RATHER THAN OTHERS
RICHARD A WHORESON CROOKBACK MISBEGOTTEN MAKES LOVE TO A WIDOWED ANN
WHAT'S IN A NAME WOOS AND WINS HER A WHORESON MERRY WIDOW
RICHARD
THE CONQUEROR THIRD BROTHER CAME AFTER WILLIAM THE CONQUERED
THE
OTHER FOUR ACTS OF THAT PLAY HANG LIMPLY FROM THAT FIRST
OF ALL HIS
KINGS RICHARD IS THE ONLY KING UNSHIELDED BY SHAKESPEARE'S REVERENCE
THE ANGEL OF THE WORLD
WHY IS THE UNDERPLOT OF KING LEAR IN WHICH
EDMUND FIGURES LIFTED OUT OF SIDNEY'S ARCADIA AND SPATCHCOCKED ON TO A
CELTIC LEGEND OLDER THAN HISTORY
THAT WAS WILL'S WAY JOHN EGLINTON DEFENDED
WE SHOULD NOT NOW COMBINE
A NORSE SAGA WITH AN EXCERPT FROM A NOVEL BY GEORGE MEREDITH
QUE
VOULEZ VOUS MOORE WOULD SAY
HE PUTS BOHEMIA ON THE SEACOAST AND MAKES
ULYSSES QUOTE ARISTOTLE
WHY STEPHEN ANSWERED HIMSELF
BECAUSE THE THEME OF THE FALSE OR
THE USURPING OR THE ADULTEROUS BROTHER OR ALL THREE IN ONE IS TO
SHAKESPEARE WHAT THE POOR ARE NOT ALWAYS WITH HIM
THE NOTE OF
BANISHMENT BANISHMENT FROM THE HEART BANISHMENT FROM HOME SOUNDS
UNINTERRUPTEDLY FROM THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA ONWARD TILL PROSPERO
BREAKS HIS STAFF BURIES IT CERTAIN FATHOMS IN THE EARTH AND DROWNS HIS
BOOK
IT DOUBLES ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS LIFE REFLECTS ITSELF IN
ANOTHER REPEATS ITSELF PROTASIS EPITASIS CATASTASIS CATASTROPHE
IT REPEATS ITSELF AGAIN WHEN HE IS NEAR THE GRAVE WHEN HIS MARRIED
DAUGHTER SUSAN CHIP OF THE OLD BLOCK IS ACCUSED OF ADULTERY
BUT IT
WAS THE ORIGINAL SIN THAT DARKENED HIS UNDERSTANDING WEAKENED HIS WILL
AND LEFT IN HIM A STRONG INCLINATION TO EVIL
THE WORDS ARE THOSE OF
MY LORDS BISHOPS OF MAYNOOTH
AN ORIGINAL SIN AND LIKE ORIGINAL SIN
COMMITTED BY ANOTHER IN WHOSE SIN HE TOO HAS SINNED
IT IS BETWEEN THE
LINES OF HIS LAST WRITTEN WORDS IT IS PETRIFIED ON HIS TOMBSTONE UNDER
WHICH HER FOUR BONES ARE NOT TO BE LAID
AGE HAS NOT WITHERED IT
BEAUTY
AND PEACE HAVE NOT DONE IT AWAY
IT IS IN INFINITE VARIETY EVERYWHERE IN
THE WORLD HE HAS CREATED IN MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING TWICE IN AS YOU
LIKE IT IN THE TEMPEST IN HAMLET IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE AND
IN ALL THE OTHER PLAYS WHICH I HAVE NOT READ
HE LAUGHED TO FREE HIS MIND FROM HIS MIND'S BONDAGE
JUDGE EGLINTON SUMMED UP
THE TRUTH IS MIDWAY HE AFFIRMED
HE IS THE GHOST AND THE PRINCE
HE
IS ALL IN ALL
HE IS STEPHEN SAID
THE BOY OF ACT ONE IS THE MATURE MAN OF ACT FIVE
ALL IN ALL
IN CYMBELINE IN OTHELLO HE IS BAWD AND CUCKOLD
HE ACTS
AND IS ACTED ON
LOVER OF AN IDEAL OR A PERVERSION LIKE JOSE HE
KILLS THE REAL CARMEN
HIS UNREMITTING INTELLECT IS THE HORNMAD IAGO
CEASELESSLY WILLING THAT THE MOOR IN HIM SHALL SUFFER
CUCKOO CUCKOO CUCK MULLIGAN CLUCKED LEWDLY
O WORD OF FEAR
DARK DOME RECEIVED REVERBED
AND WHAT A CHARACTER IS IAGO UNDAUNTED JOHN EGLINTON EXCLAIMED
WHEN
ALL IS SAID DUMAS FILS OR IS IT DUMAS PRE IS RIGHT
AFTER GOD
SHAKESPEARE HAS CREATED MOST
MAN DELIGHTS HIM NOT NOR WOMAN NEITHER STEPHEN SAID
HE RETURNS AFTER
A LIFE OF ABSENCE TO THAT SPOT OF EARTH WHERE HE WAS BORN WHERE HE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN MAN AND BOY A SILENT WITNESS AND THERE HIS JOURNEY OF
LIFE ENDED HE PLANTS HIS MULBERRYTREE IN THE EARTH
THEN DIES
THE
MOTION IS ENDED
GRAVEDIGGERS BURY HAMLET PRE AND HAMLET FILS
A KING AND A PRINCE AT LAST IN DEATH WITH INCIDENTAL MUSIC
AND WHAT
THOUGH MURDERED AND BETRAYED BEWEPT BY ALL FRAIL TENDER HEARTS FOR
DANE OR DUBLINER SORROW FOR THE DEAD IS THE ONLY HUSBAND FROM WHOM
THEY REFUSE TO BE DIVORCED
IF YOU LIKE THE EPILOGUE LOOK LONG ON IT
PROSPEROUS PROSPERO THE GOOD MAN REWARDED LIZZIE GRANDPA'S LUMP OF
LOVE AND NUNCLE RICHIE THE BAD MAN TAKEN OFF BY POETIC JUSTICE TO THE
PLACE WHERE THE BAD NIGGERS GO
STRONG CURTAIN
HE FOUND IN THE WORLD
WITHOUT AS ACTUAL WHAT WAS IN HIS WORLD WITHIN AS POSSIBLE
MAETERLINCK
SAYS IF SOCRATES LEAVE HIS HOUSE TODAY HE WILL FIND THE SAGE SEATED
ON HIS DOORSTEP
IF JUDAS GO FORTH TONIGHT IT IS TO JUDAS HIS STEPS
WILL TEND EVERY LIFE IS MANY DAYS DAY AFTER DAY

INVINCIBLE IGNORANCE
THEY

FATHER CONMEE TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG THE NORTH CIRCULAR
ROAD
IT WAS A WONDER THAT THERE WAS NOT A TRAMLINE IN SUCH AN IMPORTANT

TURFBARGE A TOWHORSE WITH PENDENT HEAD A BARGEMAN WITH A HAT OF DIRTY
STRAW SEATED AMIDSHIPS SMOKING AND STARING AT A BRANCH OF POPLAR ABOVE
HIM
IT WAS IDYLLIC AND FATHER CONMEE REFLECTED ON THE PROVIDENCE OF
THE CREATOR WHO HAD MADE TURF TO BE IN BOGS WHENCE MEN MIGHT DIG IT
OUT AND BRING IT TO TOWN AND HAMLET TO MAKE FIRES IN THE HOUSES OF POOR
PEOPLE
ON NEWCOMEN BRIDGE THE VERY REVEREND JOHN CONMEE S J
OF SAINT FRANCIS
XAVIER'S CHURCH UPPER GARDINER STREET STEPPED ON TO AN OUTWARD BOUND

CARE IN THE EYE OF ONE PLUMP KID GLOVE WHILE FOUR SHILLINGS A SIXPENCE
AND FIVE PENNIES CHUTED FROM HIS OTHER PLUMP GLOVEPALM INTO HIS PURSE
PASSING THE IVY CHURCH HE REFLECTED THAT THE TICKET INSPECTOR USUALLY
MADE HIS VISIT WHEN ONE HAD CARELESSLY THROWN AWAY THE TICKET
THE
SOLEMNITY OF THE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR SEEMED TO FATHER CONMEE EXCESSIVE
FOR A JOURNEY SO SHORT AND CHEAP
FATHER CONMEE LIKED CHEERFUL DECORUM
IT WAS A PEACEFUL DAY
THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE GLASSES OPPOSITE FATHER
CONMEE HAD FINISHED EXPLAINING AND LOOKED DOWN
HIS WIFE FATHER CONMEE
SUPPOSED
A TINY YAWN OPENED THE MOUTH OF THE WIFE OF THE GENTLEMAN WITH
THE GLASSES
SHE RAISED HER SMALL GLOVED FIST YAWNED EVER SO GENTLY
TIPTAPPING HER SMALL GLOVED FIST ON HER OPENING MOUTH AND SMILED TINILY
SWEETLY
FATHER CONMEE PERCEIVED HER PERFUME IN THE CAR
HE PERCEIVED ALSO THAT
THE AWKWARD MAN AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HER WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE
SEAT
FATHER CONMEE AT THE ALTARRAILS PLACED THE HOST WITH DIFFICULTY IN THE
MOUTH OF THE AWKWARD OLD MAN WHO HAD THE SHAKY HEAD
AT ANNESLEY BRIDGE THE TRAM HALTED AND WHEN IT WAS ABOUT TO GO AN OLD
WOMAN ROSE SUDDENLY FROM HER PLACE TO ALIGHT
THE CONDUCTOR PULLED THE
BELLSTRAP TO STAY THE CAR FOR HER
SHE PASSED OUT WITH HER BASKET AND
A MARKETNET AND FATHER CONMEE SAW THE CONDUCTOR HELP HER AND NET AND
BASKET DOWN AND FATHER CONMEE THOUGHT THAT AS SHE HAD NEARLY PASSED

ALWAYS TO BE TOLD TWICE BLESS YOU MY CHILD THAT THEY HAVE BEEN
ABSOLVED PRAY FOR ME BUT THEY HAD SO MANY WORRIES IN LIFE SO MANY
CARES POOR CREATURES
FROM THE HOARDINGS MR EUGENE STRATTON GRIMACED WITH THICK NIGGERLIPS AT
FATHER CONMEE
FATHER CONMEE THOUGHT OF THE SOULS OF BLACK AND BROWN AND YELLOW MEN AND
OF HIS SERMON ON SAINT PETER CLAVER S J
AND THE AFRICAN MISSION AND OF
THE PROPAGATION OF THE FAITH AND OF THE MILLIONS OF BLACK AND BROWN AND
YELLOW SOULS THAT HAD NOT RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF WATER WHEN THEIR LAST
HOUR CAME LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT
THAT BOOK BY THE BELGIAN JESUIT
LE NOMBRE DES LUS SEEMED TO FATHER CONMEE A REASONABLE PLEA
THOSE
WERE MILLIONS OF HUMAN SOULS CREATED BY GOD IN HIS OWN LIKENESS TO
WHOM THE FAITH HAD NOT D V BEEN BROUGHT
BUT THEY WERE GOD'S SOULS
CREATED BY GOD
IT SEEMED TO FATHER CONMEE A PITY THAT THEY SHOULD ALL
BE LOST A WASTE IF ONE MIGHT SAY
AT THE HOWTH ROAD STOP FATHER CONMEE ALIGHTED WAS SALUTED BY THE
CONDUCTOR AND SALUTED IN HIS TURN
THE MALAHIDE ROAD WAS QUIET
IT PLEASED FATHER CONMEE ROAD AND NAME
THE JOYBELLS WERE RINGING IN GAY MALAHIDE
LORD TALBOT DE MALAHIDE
IMMEDIATE HEREDITARY LORD ADMIRAL OF MALAHIDE AND THE SEAS ADJOINING
THEN CAME THE CALL TO ARMS AND SHE WAS MAID WIFE AND WIDOW IN ONE DAY
THOSE WERE OLD WORLDISH DAYS LOYAL TIMES IN JOYOUS TOWNLANDS OLD TIMES
IN THE BARONY
FATHER CONMEE WALKING THOUGHT OF HIS LITTLE BOOK OLD TIMES IN THE
BARONY AND OF THE BOOK THAT MIGHT BE WRITTEN ABOUT JESUIT HOUSES AND OF
MARY ROCHFORT DAUGHTER OF LORD MOLESWORTH FIRST COUNTESS OF BELVEDERE
A LISTLESS LADY NO MORE YOUNG WALKED ALONE THE SHORE OF LOUGH ENNEL
MARY FIRST COUNTESS OF BELVEDERE LISTLESSLY WALKING IN THE EVENING
NOT STARTLED WHEN AN OTTER PLUNGED
WHO COULD KNOW THE TRUTH NOT THE
JEALOUS LORD BELVEDERE AND NOT HER CONFESSOR IF SHE HAD NOT COMMITTED
ADULTERY FULLY EIACULATIO SEMINIS INTER VAS NATURALE MULIERIS WITH
HER HUSBAND'S BROTHER SHE WOULD HALF CONFESS IF SHE HAD NOT ALL SINNED
AS WOMEN DID
ONLY GOD KNEW AND SHE AND HE HER HUSBAND'S BROTHER
FATHER CONMEE THOUGHT OF THAT TYRANNOUS INCONTINENCE NEEDED HOWEVER FOR
MAN'S RACE ON EARTH AND OF THE WAYS OF GOD WHICH WERE NOT OUR WAYS
DON JOHN CONMEE WALKED AND MOVED IN TIMES OF YORE
HE WAS HUMANE AND
HONOURED THERE
HE BORE IN MIND SECRETS CONFESSED AND HE SMILED AT
SMILING NOBLE FACES IN A BEESWAXED DRAWINGROOM CEILED WITH FULL FRUIT
CLUSTERS
AND THE HANDS OF A BRIDE AND OF A BRIDEGROOM NOBLE TO NOBLE
WERE IMPALMED BY DON JOHN CONMEE
IT WAS A CHARMING DAY
THE LYCHGATE OF A FIELD SHOWED FATHER CONMEE BREADTHS OF CABBAGES
CURTSEYING TO HIM WITH AMPLE UNDERLEAVES
THE SKY SHOWED HIM A FLOCK OF
SMALL WHITE CLOUDS GOING SLOWLY DOWN THE WIND
MOUTONNER THE FRENCH
SAID
A JUST AND HOMELY WORD
FATHER CONMEE READING HIS OFFICE WATCHED A FLOCK OF MUTTONING CLOUDS
OVER RATHCOFFEY
HIS THINSOCKED ANKLES WERE TICKLED BY THE STUBBLE OF
CLONGOWES FIELD
HE WALKED THERE READING IN THE EVENING AND HEARD
THE CRIES OF THE BOYS' LINES AT THEIR PLAY YOUNG CRIES IN THE QUIET
EVENING
HE WAS THEIR RECTOR HIS REIGN WAS MILD
FATHER CONMEE DREW OFF HIS GLOVES AND TOOK HIS REDEDGED BREVIARY OUT
AN
IVORY BOOKMARK TOLD HIM THE PAGE
NONES
HE SHOULD HAVE READ THAT BEFORE LUNCH
BUT LADY MAXWELL HAD COME

JESUS I COULDN'T GET OVER
THAT BLOODY FOXY GERAGHTY THE DAYLIGHT ROBBER

RISES A WATCHTOWER BEHELD OF MEN AFAR
THERE SLEEP THE MIGHTY DEAD AS IN
LIFE THEY SLEPT WARRIORS AND PRINCES OF HIGH RENOWN
A PLEASANT LAND
IT IS IN SOOTH OF MURMURING WATERS FISHFUL STREAMS WHERE SPORT THE
GURNARD THE PLAICE THE ROACH THE HALIBUT THE GIBBED HADDOCK THE
GRILSE THE DAB THE BRILL THE FLOUNDER THE POLLOCK THE MIXED COARSE
FISH GENERALLY AND OTHER DENIZENS OF THE AQUEOUS KINGDOM TOO NUMEROUS TO
BE ENUMERATED
IN THE MILD BREEZES OF THE WEST AND OF THE EAST THE LOFTY
TREES WAVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THEIR FIRSTCLASS FOLIAGE THE WAFTY
SYCAMORE THE LEBANONIAN CEDAR THE EXALTED PLANETREE THE EUGENIC
EUCALYPTUS AND OTHER ORNAMENTS OF THE ARBOREAL WORLD WITH WHICH
THAT REGION IS THOROUGHLY WELL SUPPLIED
LOVELY MAIDENS SIT IN CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO THE ROOTS OF THE LOVELY TREES SINGING THE MOST LOVELY SONGS
WHILE THEY PLAY WITH ALL KINDS OF LOVELY OBJECTS AS FOR EXAMPLE GOLDEN
INGOTS SILVERY FISHES CRANS OF HERRINGS DRAFTS OF EELS CODLINGS
CREELS OF FINGERLINGS PURPLE SEAGEMS AND PLAYFUL INSECTS

EWES AND SHEARLING RAMS AND LAMBS AND STUBBLE GEESE AND MEDIUM STEERS
AND ROARING MARES AND POLLED CALVES AND LONGWOODS AND STORESHEEP AND
CUFFE'S PRIME SPRINGERS AND CULLS AND SOWPIGS AND BACONHOGS AND THE
VARIOUS DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF HIGHLY DISTINGUISHED SWINE AND ANGUS
HEIFERS AND POLLY BULLLOCKS OF IMMACULATE PEDIGREE TOGETHER WITH PRIME
PREMIATED MILCHCOWS AND BEEVES AND THERE IS EVER HEARD A TRAMPLING
CACKLING ROARING LOWING BLEATING BELLOWING RUMBLING GRUNTING
CHAMPING CHEWING OF SHEEP AND PIGS AND HEAVYHOOVED KINE FROM
PASTURELANDS OF LUSK AND RUSH AND CARRICKMINES AND FROM THE STREAMY
VALES OF THOMOND FROM THE M'GILLICUDDY'S REEKS THE INACCESSIBLE AND

MILK AND BUTTS OF BUTTER AND RENNETS OF CHEESE AND FARMER'S FIRKINS AND
TARGETS OF LAMB AND CRANNOCKS OF CORN AND OBLONG EGGS IN GREAT HUNDREDS
VARIOUS IN SIZE THE AGATE WITH THIS DUN
SO WE TURNED INTO BARNEY KIERNAN'S AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE
CITIZEN UP IN THE CORNER HAVING A GREAT CONFAB WITH HIMSELF AND THAT
BLOODY MANGY MONGREL GARRYOWEN AND HE WAITING FOR WHAT THE SKY WOULD
DROP IN THE WAY OF DRINK
THERE HE IS SAYS I IN HIS GLORYHOLE WITH HIS CRUISKEEN LAWN AND HIS
LOAD OF PAPERS WORKING FOR THE CAUSE
THE BLOODY MONGREL LET A GROUSE OUT OF HIM WOULD GIVE YOU THE CREEPS
BE
A CORPORAL WORK OF MERCY IF SOMEONE WOULD TAKE THE LIFE OF THAT BLOODY
DOG
I'M TOLD FOR A FACT HE ATE A GOOD PART OF THE BREECHES OFF A
CONSTABULARY MAN IN SANTRY THAT CAME ROUND ONE TIME WITH A BLUE PAPER
ABOUT A LICENCE
STAND AND DELIVER SAYS HE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT CITIZEN SAYS JOE
FRIENDS HERE
PASS FRIENDS SAYS HE
THEN HE RUBS HIS HAND IN HIS EYE AND SAYS HE
WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF THE TIMES
DOING THE RAPPAREE AND RORY OF THE HILL
BUT BEGOB JOE WAS EQUAL TO
THE OCCASION
I THINK THE MARKETS ARE ON A RISE SAYS HE SLIDING HIS HAND DOWN HIS
FORK
SO BEGOB THE CITIZEN CLAPS HIS PAW ON HIS KNEE AND HE SAYS
FOREIGN WARS IS THE CAUSE OF IT
AND SAYS JOE STICKING HIS THUMB IN HIS POCKET

AND BY JESUS HE NEAR THROTTLED HIM
THE FIGURE SEATED ON A LARGE BOULDER AT THE FOOT OF A ROUND TOWER WAS
THAT OF A BROADSHOULDERED DEEPCHESTED STRONGLIMBED FRANKEYED REDHAIRED

BODY WHEREVER VISIBLE WITH A STRONG GROWTH OF TAWNY PRICKLY HAIR IN
HUE AND TOUGHNESS SIMILAR TO THE MOUNTAIN GORSE ULEX EUROPEUS
THE WIDEWINGED NOSTRILS FROM WHICH BRISTLES OF THE SAME TAWNY HUE
PROJECTED WERE OF SUCH CAPACIOUSNESS THAT WITHIN THEIR CAVERNOUS
OBSCURITY THE FIELDLARK MIGHT EASILY HAVE LODGED HER NEST
THE EYES
IN WHICH A TEAR AND A SMILE STROVE EVER FOR THE MASTERY WERE OF THE
DIMENSIONS OF A GOODSIZED CAULIFLOWER
A POWERFUL CURRENT OF WARM BREATH
ISSUED AT REGULAR INTERVALS FROM THE PROFOUND CAVITY OF HIS MOUTH
WHILE IN RHYTHMIC RESONANCE THE LOUD STRONG HALE REVERBERATIONS OF HIS
FORMIDABLE HEART THUNDERED RUMBLINGLY CAUSING THE GROUND THE SUMMIT OF
THE LOFTY TOWER AND THE STILL LOFTIER WALLS OF THE CAVE TO VIBRATE AND
TREMBLE
HE WORE A LONG UNSLEEVED GARMENT OF RECENTLY FLAYED OXHIDE REACHING
TO THE KNEES IN A LOOSE KILT AND THIS WAS BOUND ABOUT HIS MIDDLE BY
A GIRDLE OF PLAITED STRAW AND RUSHES
BENEATH THIS HE WORE TREWS OF

SUBMITTED TO TRIAL AT THE HANDS OF CERTAIN BLOODTHIRSTY ENTITIES ON THE
LOWER ASTRAL LEVELS
IN REPLY TO A QUESTION AS TO HIS FIRST SENSATIONS
IN THE GREAT DIVIDE BEYOND HE STATED THAT PREVIOUSLY HE HAD SEEN AS IN A
GLASS DARKLY BUT THAT THOSE WHO HAD PASSED OVER HAD SUMMIT POSSIBILITIES
OF ATMIC DEVELOPMENT OPENED UP TO THEM
INTERROGATED AS TO WHETHER LIFE
THERE RESEMBLED OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE FLESH HE STATED THAT HE HAD HEARD
FROM MORE FAVOURED BEINGS NOW IN THE SPIRIT THAT THEIR ABODES WERE
EQUIPPED WITH EVERY MODERN HOME COMFORT SUCH AS TALAFANA ALAVATAR
HATAKALDA WATAKLASAT AND THAT THE HIGHEST ADEPTS WERE STEEPED IN
WAVES OF VOLUPCY OF THE VERY PUREST NATURE
HAVING REQUESTED A QUART OF
BUTTERMILK THIS WAS BROUGHT AND EVIDENTLY AFFORDED RELIEF
ASKED IF HE
HAD ANY MESSAGE FOR THE LIVING HE EXHORTED ALL WHO WERE STILL AT THE
WRONG SIDE OF MAYA TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUE PATH FOR IT WAS REPORTED
IN DEVANIC CIRCLES THAT MARS AND JUPITER WERE OUT FOR MISCHIEF ON THE

THE OTHER BOOT WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WAS AT PRESENT UNDER THE
COMMODE IN THE RETURN ROOM AND THAT THE PAIR SHOULD BE SENT TO CULLEN'S
TO BE SOLED ONLY AS THE HEELS WERE STILL GOOD
HE STATED THAT THIS HAD
GREATLY PERTURBED HIS PEACE OF MIND IN THE OTHER REGION AND EARNESTLY
REQUESTED THAT HIS DESIRE SHOULD BE MADE KNOWN
ASSURANCES WERE GIVEN THAT THE MATTER WOULD BE ATTENDED TO AND IT WAS
INTIMATED THAT THIS HAD GIVEN SATISFACTION

DEADLY COIL THEY GRASP YEA AND THEREIN THEY LEAD TO EREBUS WHATSOEVER
WIGHT HATH DONE A DEED OF BLOOD FOR I WILL ON NOWISE SUFFER IT EVEN SO

THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED BY SCIENCE SAYS BLOOM
IT'S ONLY A NATURAL
PHENOMENON DON'T YOU SEE BECAUSE ON ACCOUNT OF THE
AND THEN HE STARTS WITH HIS JAWBREAKERS ABOUT PHENOMENON AND SCIENCE AND
THIS PHENOMENON AND THE OTHER PHENOMENON
THE DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST HERR PROFESSOR LUITPOLD BLUMENDUFT TENDERED
MEDICAL EVIDENCE TO THE EFFECT THAT THE INSTANTANEOUS FRACTURE OF THE
CERVICAL VERTEBRAE AND CONSEQUENT SCISSION OF THE SPINAL CORD WOULD
ACCORDING TO THE BEST APPROVED TRADITION OF MEDICAL SCIENCE BE
CALCULATED TO INEVITABLY PRODUCE IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT A VIOLENT
GANGLIONIC STIMULUS OF THE NERVE CENTRES OF THE GENITAL APPARATUS
THEREBY CAUSING THE ELASTIC PORES OF THE CORPORA CAVERNOSA TO RAPIDLY
DILATE IN SUCH A WAY AS TO INSTANTANEOUSLY FACILITATE THE FLOW OF BLOOD
TO THAT PART OF THE HUMAN ANATOMY KNOWN AS THE PENIS OR MALE ORGAN
RESULTING IN THE PHENOMENON WHICH HAS BEEN DENOMINATED BY THE FACULTY
A MORBID UPWARDS AND OUTWARDS PHILOPROGENITIVE ERECTION IN ARTICULO
MORTIS PER DIMINUTIONEM CAPITIS
SO OF COURSE THE CITIZEN WAS ONLY WAITING FOR THE WINK OF THE WORD AND
HE STARTS GASSING OUT OF HIM ABOUT THE INVINCIBLES AND THE OLD GUARD AND

THE LAST FAREWELL WAS AFFECTING IN THE EXTREME
FROM THE BELFRIES FAR

GLOOMY PRECINCTS ROLLED THE OMINOUS WARNING OF A HUNDRED MUFFLED DRUMS
PUNCTUATED BY THE HOLLOW BOOMING OF PIECES OF ORDNANCE
THE DEAFENING

THE GHASTLY SCENE TESTIFIED THAT THE ARTILLERY OF HEAVEN HAD LENT ITS
SUPERNATURAL POMP TO THE ALREADY GRUESOME SPECTACLE
A TORRENTIAL RAIN

WITH THEIR BROADSHEETS AMONG LOVERS OF THE COMEDY ELEMENT AND NOBODY
WHO HAS A CORNER IN HIS HEART FOR REAL IRISH FUN WITHOUT VULGARITY

THE CHILDREN OF THE MALE AND

EXCELLENT IDEA OF AFFORDING THE POOR FATHERLESS AND MOTHERLESS CHILDREN

PROFUSELY
COMMENDATORE BENINOBENONE HAVING BEEN EXTRICATED FROM
UNDERNEATH THE PRESIDENTIAL ARMCHAIR IT WAS EXPLAINED BY HIS LEGAL
ADVISER AVVOCATO PAGAMIMI THAT THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SECRETED IN HIS
THIRTYTWO POCKETS HAD BEEN ABSTRACTED BY HIM DURING THE AFFRAY FROM THE
POCKETS OF HIS JUNIOR COLLEAGUES IN THE HOPE OF BRINGING THEM TO THEIR
SENSES

HE ANNOUNCED HIS PRESENCE BY THAT GENTLE RUMBOLDIAN COUGH
WHICH SO MANY HAVE TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO IMITATE SHORT
PAINSTAKING YET WITHAL SO CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MAN
THE ARRIVAL OF THE
WORLDRENOWNED HEADSMAN WAS GREETED BY A ROAR OF ACCLAMATION FROM THE
HUGE CONCOURSE THE VICEREGAL LADIES WAVING THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS IN
THEIR EXCITEMENT WHILE THE EVEN MORE EXCITABLE FOREIGN DELEGATES

THOSE PIERCINGLY LOVELY NOTES WITH WHICH THE EUNUCH CATALANI BEGLAMOURED
OUR GREATGREATGRANDMOTHERS WAS EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE
IT WAS EXACTLY
SEVENTEEN O'CLOCK
THE SIGNAL FOR PRAYER WAS THEN PROMPTLY GIVEN BY
MEGAPHONE AND IN AN INSTANT ALL HEADS WERE BARED THE COMMENDATORE'S
PATRIARCHAL SOMBRERO WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE POSSESSION OF HIS FAMILY
SINCE THE REVOLUTION OF RIENZI BEING REMOVED BY HIS MEDICAL ADVISER
IN ATTENDANCE DR PIPPI
THE LEARNED PRELATE WHO ADMINISTERED THE LAST
COMFORTS OF HOLY RELIGION TO THE HERO MARTYR WHEN ABOUT TO PAY THE DEATH
PENALTY KNELT IN A MOST CHRISTIAN SPIRIT IN A POOL OF RAINWATER HIS
CASSOCK ABOVE HIS HOARY HEAD AND OFFERED UP TO THE THRONE OF GRACE
FERVENT PRAYERS OF SUPPLICATION
HAND BY THE BLOCK STOOD THE GRIM FIGURE
OF THE EXECUTIONER HIS VISAGE BEING CONCEALED IN A TENGALLON POT
WITH TWO CIRCULAR PERFORATED APERTURES THROUGH WHICH HIS EYES GLOWERED
FURIOUSLY
AS HE AWAITED THE FATAL SIGNAL HE TESTED THE EDGE OF HIS
HORRIBLE WEAPON BY HONING IT UPON HIS BRAWNY FOREARM OR DECAPITATED
IN RAPID SUCCESSION A FLOCK OF SHEEP WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED BY THE
ADMIRERS OF HIS FELL BUT NECESSARY OFFICE
ON A HANDSOME MAHOGANY TABLE
NEAR HIM WERE NEATLY ARRANGED THE QUARTERING KNIFE THE VARIOUS
FINELY TEMPERED DISEMBOWELLING APPLIANCES SPECIALLY SUPPLIED BY THE
WORLDFAMOUS FIRM OF CUTLERS MESSRS JOHN ROUND AND SONS SHEFFIELD
A TERRA COTTA SAUCEPAN FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE DUODENUM COLON
BLIND INTESTINE AND APPENDIX ETC WHEN SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED AND TWO
COMMODIOUS MILKJUGS DESTINED TO RECEIVE THE MOST PRECIOUS BLOOD OF THE
MOST PRECIOUS VICTIM
THE HOUSESTEWARD OF THE AMALGAMATED CATS' AND
DOGS' HOME WAS IN ATTENDANCE TO CONVEY THESE VESSELS WHEN REPLENISHED
TO THAT BENEFICENT INSTITUTION
QUITE AN EXCELLENT REPAST CONSISTING OF
RASHERS AND EGGS FRIED STEAK AND ONIONS DONE TO A NICETY DELICIOUS
HOT BREAKFAST ROLLS AND INVIGORATING TEA HAD BEEN CONSIDERATELY PROVIDED
BY THE AUTHORITIES FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THE
TRAGEDY WHO WAS IN CAPITAL SPIRITS WHEN PREPARED FOR DEATH AND EVINCED
THE KEENEST INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT HE
WITH AN ABNEGATION RARE IN THESE OUR TIMES ROSE NOBLY TO THE OCCASION
AND EXPRESSED THE DYING WISH IMMEDIATELY ACCEDED TO THAT THE MEAL
SHOULD BE DIVIDED IN ALIQUOT PARTS AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE SICK AND
INDIGENT ROOMKEEPERS' ASSOCIATION AS A TOKEN OF HIS REGARD AND ESTEEM
THE NEC AND NON PLUS ULTRA OF EMOTION WERE REACHED WHEN THE BLUSHING
BRIDE ELECT BURST HER WAY THROUGH THE SERRIED RANKS OF THE BYSTANDERS
AND FLUNG HERSELF UPON THE MUSCULAR BOSOM OF HIM WHO WAS ABOUT TO BE
LAUNCHED INTO ETERNITY FOR HER SAKE
THE HERO FOLDED HER WILLOWY FORM IN
A LOVING EMBRACE MURMURING FONDLY SHEILA MY OWN
ENCOURAGED BY
THIS USE OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME SHE KISSED PASSIONATELY ALL THE VARIOUS
SUITABLE AREAS OF HIS PERSON WHICH THE DECENCIES OF PRISON GARB
PERMITTED HER ARDOUR TO REACH
SHE SWORE TO HIM AS THEY MINGLED THE SALT
STREAMS OF THEIR TEARS THAT SHE WOULD EVER CHERISH HIS MEMORY THAT SHE
WOULD NEVER FORGET HER HERO BOY WHO WENT TO HIS DEATH WITH A SONG ON HIS
LIPS AS IF HE WERE BUT GOING TO A HURLING MATCH IN CLONTURK PARK
SHE
BROUGHT BACK TO HIS RECOLLECTION THE HAPPY DAYS OF BLISSFUL CHILDHOOD
TOGETHER ON THE BANKS OF ANNA LIFFEY WHEN THEY HAD INDULGED IN THE
INNOCENT PASTIMES OF THE YOUNG AND OBLIVIOUS OF THE DREADFUL PRESENT
THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY ALL THE SPECTATORS INCLUDING THE VENERABLE
PASTOR JOINING IN THE GENERAL MERRIMENT
THAT MONSTER AUDIENCE SIMPLY
ROCKED WITH DELIGHT
BUT ANON THEY WERE OVERCOME WITH GRIEF AND CLASPED
THEIR HANDS FOR THE LAST TIME
A FRESH TORRENT OF TEARS BURST FROM THEIR
LACHRYMAL DUCTS AND THE VAST CONCOURSE OF PEOPLE TOUCHED TO THE INMOST
CORE BROKE INTO HEARTRENDING SOBS NOT THE LEAST AFFECTED BEING THE
AGED PREBENDARY HIMSELF
BIG STRONG MEN OFFICERS OF THE PEACE AND
GENIAL GIANTS OF THE ROYAL IRISH CONSTABULARY WERE MAKING FRANK USE OF
THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS AND IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NOT A DRY EYE
IN THAT RECORD ASSEMBLAGE
A MOST ROMANTIC INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN A
HANDSOME YOUNG OXFORD GRADUATE NOTED FOR HIS CHIVALRY TOWARDS THE FAIR
SEX STEPPED FORWARD AND PRESENTING HIS VISITING CARD BANKBOOK
AND GENEALOGICAL TREE SOLICITED THE HAND OF THE HAPLESS YOUNG LADY
REQUESTING HER TO NAME THE DAY AND WAS ACCEPTED ON THE SPOT
EVERY LADY
IN THE AUDIENCE WAS PRESENTED WITH A TASTEFUL SOUVENIR OF THE OCCASION
IN THE SHAPE OF A SKULL AND CROSSBONES BROOCH A TIMELY AND GENEROUS
ACT WHICH EVOKED A FRESH OUTBURST OF EMOTION AND WHEN THE GALLANT YOUNG
OXONIAN THE BEARER BY THE WAY OF ONE OF THE MOST TIMEHONOURED NAMES
IN ALBION'S HISTORY PLACED ON THE FINGER OF HIS BLUSHING FIANCE AN
EXPENSIVE ENGAGEMENT RING WITH EMERALDS SET IN THE FORM OF A
FOURLEAVED SHAMROCK THE EXCITEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS
NAY EVEN THE
STER PROVOSTMARSHAL LIEUTENANTCOLONEL TOMKIN MAXWELL FFRENCHMULLAN
TOMLINSON WHO PRESIDED ON THE SAD OCCASION HE WHO HAD BLOWN A
CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF SEPOYS FROM THE CANNONMOUTH WITHOUT FLINCHING
COULD NOT NOW RESTRAIN HIS NATURAL EMOTION
WITH HIS MAILED GAUNTLET
HE BRUSHED AWAY A FURTIVE TEAR AND WAS OVERHEARD BY THOSE PRIVILEGED
BURGHERS WHO HAPPENED TO BE IN HIS IMMEDIATE ENTOURAGE TO MURMUR TO
HIMSELF IN A FALTERING UNDERTONE
GOD BLIMEY IF SHE AINT A CLINKER THAT THERE BLEEDING TART
BLIMEY IT
MAKES ME KIND OF BLEEDING CRY STRAIGHT IT DOES WHEN I SEES HER CAUSE
I THINKS OF MY OLD MASHTUB WHAT'S WAITING FOR ME DOWN LIMEHOUSE WAY
SO THEN THE CITIZEN BEGINS TALKING ABOUT THE IRISH LANGUAGE AND THE
CORPORATION MEETING AND ALL TO THAT AND THE SHONEENS THAT CAN'T SPEAK
THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND JOE CHIPPING IN BECAUSE HE STUCK SOMEONE FOR A
QUID AND BLOOM PUTTING IN HIS OLD GOO WITH HIS TWOPENNY STUMP THAT
HE CADGED OFF OF JOE AND TALKING ABOUT THE GAELIC LEAGUE AND THE
ANTITREATING LEAGUE AND DRINK THE CURSE OF IRELAND
ANTITREATING IS
ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT
GOB HE'D LET YOU POUR ALL MANNER OF DRINK DOWN
HIS THROAT TILL THE LORD WOULD CALL HIM BEFORE YOU'D EVER SEE THE FROTH
OF HIS PINT
AND ONE NIGHT I WENT IN WITH A FELLOW INTO ONE OF THEIR
MUSICAL EVENINGS SONG AND DANCE ABOUT SHE COULD GET UP ON A TRUSS OF
HAY SHE COULD MY MAUREEN LAY AND THERE WAS A FELLOW WITH A BALLYHOOLY
BLUE RIBBON BADGE SPIFFING OUT OF HIM IN IRISH AND A LOT OF COLLEEN
BAWNS GOING ABOUT WITH TEMPERANCE BEVERAGES AND SELLING MEDALS
AND ORANGES AND LEMONADE AND A FEW OLD DRY BUNS GOB FLAHOOLAGH
ENTERTAINMENT DON'T BE TALKING
IRELAND SOBER IS IRELAND FREE
AND
THEN AN OLD FELLOW STARTS BLOWING INTO HIS BAGPIPES AND ALL THE GOUGERS
SHUFFLING THEIR FEET TO THE TUNE THE OLD COW DIED OF
AND ONE OR TWO
SKY PILOTS HAVING AN EYE AROUND THAT THERE WAS NO GOINGS ON WITH THE
FEMALES HITTING BELOW THE BELT
SO HOWANDEVER AS I WAS SAYING THE OLD DOG SEEING THE TIN WAS EMPTY
STARTS MOUSING AROUND BY JOE AND ME
I'D TRAIN HIM BY KINDNESS SO I
WOULD IF HE WAS MY DOG
GIVE HIM A ROUSING FINE KICK NOW AND AGAIN
WHERE IT WOULDN'T BLIND HIM
AFRAID HE'LL BITE YOU SAYS THE CITIZEN JEERING
NO SAYS I
BUT HE MIGHT TAKE MY LEG FOR A LAMPPOST
SO HE CALLS THE OLD DOG OVER
WHAT'S ON YOU GARRY SAYS HE
THEN HE STARTS HAULING AND MAULING AND TALKING TO HIM IN IRISH AND THE
OLD TOWSER GROWLING LETTING ON TO ANSWER LIKE A DUET IN THE OPERA
SUCH GROWLING YOU NEVER HEARD AS THEY LET OFF BETWEEN THEM
SOMEONE THAT
HAS NOTHING BETTER TO DO OUGHT TO WRITE A LETTER PRO BONO PUBLICO TO
THE PAPERS ABOUT THE MUZZLING ORDER FOR A DOG THE LIKE OF THAT
GROWLING
AND GROUSING AND HIS EYE ALL BLOODSHOT FROM THE DROUTH IS IN IT AND THE
HYDROPHOBIA DROPPING OUT OF HIS JAWS
ALL THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE SPREAD OF HUMAN CULTURE AMONG THE
LOWER ANIMALS AND THEIR NAME IS LEGION SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF NOT
MISSING THE REALLY MARVELLOUS EXHIBITION OF CYNANTHROPY GIVEN BY THE
FAMOUS OLD IRISH RED SETTER WOLFDOG FORMERLY KNOWN BY THE SOBRIQUET OF
GARRYOWEN AND RECENTLY RECHRISTENED BY HIS LARGE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS AND
ACQUAINTANCES OWEN GARRY
THE EXHIBITION WHICH IS THE RESULT OF YEARS
OF TRAINING BY KINDNESS AND A CAREFULLY THOUGHTOUT DIETARY SYSTEM
COMPRISES AMONG OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS THE RECITATION OF VERSE
OUR
GREATEST LIVING PHONETIC EXPERT WILD HORSES SHALL NOT DRAG IT FROM US
HAS LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED IN HIS EFFORTS TO DELUCIDATE AND COMPARE
THE VERSE RECITED AND HAS FOUND IT BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE THE
ITALICS ARE OURS TO THE RANNS OF ANCIENT CELTIC BARDS
WE ARE NOT
SPEAKING SO MUCH OF THOSE DELIGHTFUL LOVESONGS WITH WHICH THE WRITER WHO
CONCEALS HIS IDENTITY UNDER THE GRACEFUL PSEUDONYM OF THE LITTLE
SWEET BRANCH HAS FAMILIARISED THE BOOKLOVING WORLD BUT RATHER AS
A CONTRIBUTOR D
O
C
POINTS OUT IN AN INTERESTING COMMUNICATION
PUBLISHED BY AN EVENING CONTEMPORARY OF THE HARSHER AND MORE PERSONAL
NOTE WHICH IS FOUND IN THE SATIRICAL EFFUSIONS OF THE FAMOUS RAFTERY AND
OF DONAL MACCONSIDINE TO SAY NOTHING OF A MORE MODERN LYRIST AT PRESENT
VERY MUCH IN THE PUBLIC EYE
WE SUBJOIN A SPECIMEN WHICH HAS BEEN
RENDERED INTO ENGLISH BY AN EMINENT SCHOLAR WHOSE NAME FOR THE MOMENT WE
ARE NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCLOSE THOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR READERS WILL
FIND THE TOPICAL ALLUSION RATHER MORE THAN AN INDICATION
THE METRICAL
SYSTEM OF THE CANINE ORIGINAL WHICH RECALLS THE INTRICATE ALLITERATIVE
AND ISOSYLLABIC RULES OF THE WELSH ENGLYN IS INFINITELY MORE
COMPLICATED BUT WE BELIEVE OUR READERS WILL AGREE THAT THE SPIRIT HAS
BEEN WELL CAUGHT
PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE ADDED THAT THE EFFECT IS GREATLY
INCREASED IF OWEN'S VERSE BE SPOKEN SOMEWHAT SLOWLY AND INDISTINCTLY IN
A TONE SUGGESTIVE OF SUPPRESSED RANCOUR
THE CURSE OF MY CURSES
SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY
AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS
ON YOU BARNEY KIERNAN
HAS NO SUP OF WATER
TO COOL MY COURAGE
AND MY GUTS RED ROARING
AFTER LOWRY'S LIGHTS
SO HE TOLD TERRY TO BRING SOME WATER FOR THE DOG AND GOB YOU COULD
HEAR HIM LAPPING IT UP A MILE OFF
AND JOE ASKED HIM WOULD HE HAVE
ANOTHER
I WILL SAYS HE A CHARA TO SHOW THERE'S NO ILL FEELING
GOB HE'S NOT AS GREEN AS HE'S CABBAGELOOKING
ARSING AROUND FROM ONE
PUB TO ANOTHER LEAVING IT TO YOUR OWN HONOUR WITH OLD GILTRAP'S DOG
AND GETTING FED UP BY THE RATEPAYERS AND CORPORATORS
ENTERTAINMENT FOR
MAN AND BEAST
AND SAYS JOE
COULD YOU MAKE A HOLE IN ANOTHER PINT
COULD A SWIM DUCK SAYS I
SAME AGAIN TERRY SAYS JOE
ARE YOU SURE YOU WON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN
THE WAY OF LIQUID REFRESHMENT SAYS HE
THANK YOU NO SAYS BLOOM
AS A MATTER OF FACT I JUST WANTED TO MEET
MARTIN CUNNINGHAM DON'T YOU SEE ABOUT THIS INSURANCE OF POOR DIGNAM'S
MARTIN ASKED ME TO GO TO THE HOUSE
YOU SEE HE DIGNAM I MEAN DIDN'T
SERVE ANY NOTICE OF THE ASSIGNMENT ON THE COMPANY AT THE TIME AND
NOMINALLY UNDER THE ACT THE MORTGAGEE CAN'T RECOVER ON THE POLICY
HOLY WARS SAYS JOE LAUGHING THAT'S A GOOD ONE IF OLD SHYLOCK IS
LANDED
SO THE WIFE COMES OUT TOP DOG WHAT
WELL THAT'S A POINT SAYS BLOOM FOR THE WIFE'S ADMIRERS
WHOSE ADMIRERS SAYS JOE
THE WIFE'S ADVISERS I MEAN SAYS BLOOM
THEN HE STARTS ALL CONFUSED MUCKING IT UP ABOUT MORTGAGOR UNDER THE ACT
LIKE THE LORD CHANCELLOR GIVING IT OUT ON THE BENCH AND FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THE WIFE AND THAT A TRUST IS CREATED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT
DIGNAM OWED BRIDGEMAN THE MONEY AND IF NOW THE WIFE OR THE WIDOW
CONTESTED THE MORTGAGEE'S RIGHT TILL HE NEAR HAD THE HEAD OF ME ADDLED
WITH HIS MORTGAGOR UNDER THE ACT
HE WAS BLOODY SAFE HE WASN'T RUN IN
HIMSELF UNDER THE ACT THAT TIME AS A ROGUE AND VAGABOND ONLY HE HAD A
FRIEND IN COURT
SELLING BAZAAR TICKETS OR WHAT DO YOU CALL IT ROYAL
HUNGARIAN PRIVILEGED LOTTERY

SLIGHT IT MAY APPEAR IF JUDGED BY THE STANDARD OF MERE TIME IS FOUNDED
AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE ON A SENTIMENT OF MUTUAL ESTEEM AS TO REQUEST OF
YOU THIS FAVOUR
BUT SHOULD I HAVE OVERSTEPPED THE LIMITS OF RESERVE
LET THE SINCERITY OF MY FEELINGS BE THE EXCUSE FOR MY BOLDNESS
NO REJOINED THE OTHER I APPRECIATE TO THE FULL THE MOTIVES WHICH
ACTUATE YOUR CONDUCT AND I SHALL DISCHARGE THE OFFICE YOU ENTRUST TO
ME CONSOLED BY THE REFLECTION THAT THOUGH THE ERRAND BE ONE OF SORROW
THIS PROOF OF YOUR CONFIDENCE SWEETENS IN SOME MEASURE THE BITTERNESS OF
THE CUP
THEN SUFFER ME TO TAKE YOUR HAND SAID HE
THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART
I FEEL SURE WILL DICTATE TO YOU BETTER THAN MY INADEQUATE WORDS
THE EXPRESSIONS WHICH ARE MOST SUITABLE TO CONVEY AN EMOTION WHOSE
POIGNANCY WERE I TO GIVE VENT TO MY FEELINGS WOULD DEPRIVE ME EVEN OF
SPEECH

HELL UPON EARTH IT IS
READ THE REVELATIONS THAT'S GOING ON IN THE PAPERS ABOUT FLOGGING ON

DISGUSTED ONE
SO HE STARTS TELLING US ABOUT CORPORAL PUNISHMENT AND ABOUT THE CREW
OF TARS AND OFFICERS AND REARADMIRALS DRAWN UP IN COCKED HATS AND THE
PARSON WITH HIS PROTESTANT BIBLE TO WITNESS PUNISHMENT AND A YOUNG LAD
BROUGHT OUT HOWLING FOR HIS MA AND THEY TIE HIM DOWN ON THE BUTTEND OF
A GUN
A RUMP AND DOZEN SAYS THE CITIZEN WAS WHAT THAT OLD RUFFIAN SIR JOHN
BERESFORD CALLED IT BUT THE MODERN GOD'S ENGLISHMAN CALLS IT CANING ON

THAT'S YOUR GLORIOUS BRITISH NAVY SAYS THE CITIZEN THAT BOSSES THE
EARTH
THE FELLOWS THAT NEVER WILL BE SLAVES WITH THE ONLY HEREDITARY CHAMBER
ON THE FACE OF GOD'S EARTH AND THEIR LAND IN THE HANDS OF A DOZEN
GAMEHOGS AND COTTONBALL BARONS
THAT'S THE GREAT EMPIRE THEY BOAST ABOUT
OF DRUDGES AND WHIPPED SERFS
ON WHICH THE SUN NEVER RISES SAYS JOE
AND THE TRAGEDY OF IT IS SAYS THE CITIZEN THEY BELIEVE IT
THE
UNFORTUNATE YAHOOS BELIEVE IT
THEY BELIEVE IN ROD THE SCOURGER ALMIGHTY CREATOR OF HELL UPON EARTH
AND IN JACKY TAR THE SON OF A GUN WHO WAS CONCEIVED OF UNHOLY BOAST
BORN OF THE FIGHTING NAVY SUFFERED UNDER RUMP AND DOZEN WAS SCARIFIED
FLAYED AND CURRIED YELLED LIKE BLOODY HELL THE THIRD DAY HE AROSE
AGAIN FROM THE BED STEERED INTO HAVEN SITTETH ON HIS BEAMEND TILL

OF CROPS THAT THE BRITISH HYENAS BOUGHT AND SOLD IN RIO DE JANEIRO
AY
THEY DROVE OUT THE PEASANTS IN HORDES
TWENTY THOUSAND OF THEM DIED IN

CRAVENS THE SONS OF GRANUAILE THE CHAMPIONS OF KATHLEEN NI HOULIHAN

THE CATASTROPHE WAS TERRIFIC AND INSTANTANEOUS IN ITS EFFECT
THE
OBSERVATORY OF DUNSINK REGISTERED IN ALL ELEVEN SHOCKS ALL OF THE FIFTH
GRADE OF MERCALLI'S SCALE AND THERE IS NO RECORD EXTANT OF A SIMILAR
SEISMIC DISTURBANCE IN OUR ISLAND SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1534 THE YEAR

THAT PART OF THE METROPOLIS WHICH CONSTITUTES THE INN'S QUAY WARD AND
PARISH OF SAINT MICHAN COVERING A SURFACE OF FORTYONE ACRES TWO ROODS
AND ONE SQUARE POLE OR PERCH
ALL THE LORDLY RESIDENCES IN THE VICINITY
OF THE PALACE OF JUSTICE WERE DEMOLISHED AND THAT NOBLE EDIFICE ITSELF
IN WHICH AT THE TIME OF THE CATASTROPHE IMPORTANT LEGAL DEBATES WERE IN
PROGRESS IS LITERALLY A MASS OF RUINS BENEATH WHICH IT IS TO BE
FEARED ALL THE OCCUPANTS HAVE BEEN BURIED ALIVE
FROM THE REPORTS OF
EYEWITNESSES IT TRANSPIRES THAT THE SEISMIC WAVES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY
A VIOLENT ATMOSPHERIC PERTURBATION OF CYCLONIC CHARACTER

MESSAGES OF CONDOLENCE AND SYMPATHY ARE BEING HOURLY RECEIVED
FROM ALL PARTS OF THE DIFFERENT CONTINENTS AND THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HAS

HUNDRED TO FIVE JESUS HE TOOK THE VALUE OF IT OUT OF HIM I PROMISE

WHEN LO THERE CAME ABOUT THEM ALL A GREAT BRIGHTNESS AND THEY BEHELD
THE CHARIOT WHEREIN HE STOOD ASCEND TO HEAVEN
AND THEY BEHELD HIM IN
THE CHARIOT CLOTHED UPON IN THE GLORY OF THE BRIGHTNESS HAVING RAIMENT
AS OF THE SUN FAIR AS THE MOON AND TERRIBLE THAT FOR AWE THEY DURST NOT
LOOK UPON HIM
AND THERE CAME A VOICE OUT OF HEAVEN CALLING ELIJAH
ELIJAH AND HE ANSWERED WITH A MAIN CRY ABBA ADONAI AND THEY
BEHELD HIM EVEN HIM BEN BLOOM ELIJAH AMID CLOUDS OF ANGELS ASCEND
TO THE GLORY OF THE BRIGHTNESS AT AN ANGLE OF FORTYFIVE DEGREES OVER
DONOHOE'S IN LITTLE GREEN STREET LIKE A SHOT OFF A SHOVEL
THE SUMMER EVENING HAD BEGUN TO FOLD THE WORLD IN ITS MYSTERIOUS
EMBRACE
FAR AWAY IN THE WEST THE SUN WAS SETTING AND THE LAST GLOW OF
ALL TOO FLEETING DAY LINGERED LOVINGLY ON SEA AND STRAND ON THE PROUD
PROMONTORY OF DEAR OLD HOWTH GUARDING AS EVER THE WATERS OF THE BAY ON
THE WEEDGROWN ROCKS ALONG SANDYMOUNT SHORE AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST ON
THE QUIET CHURCH WHENCE THERE STREAMED FORTH AT TIMES UPON THE STILLNESS
THE VOICE OF PRAYER TO HER WHO IS IN HER PURE RADIANCE A BEACON EVER TO
THE STORMTOSSED HEART OF MAN MARY STAR OF THE SEA
THE THREE GIRL FRIENDS WERE SEATED ON THE ROCKS ENJOYING THE EVENING
SCENE AND THE AIR WHICH WAS FRESH BUT NOT TOO CHILLY
MANY A TIME AND
OFT WERE THEY WONT TO COME THERE TO THAT FAVOURITE NOOK TO HAVE A COSY
CHAT BESIDE THE SPARKLING WAVES AND DISCUSS MATTERS FEMININE CISSY
CAFFREY AND EDY BOARDMAN WITH THE BABY IN THE PUSHCAR AND TOMMY AND
JACKY CAFFREY TWO LITTLE CURLYHEADED BOYS DRESSED IN SAILOR SUITS WITH
CAPS TO MATCH AND THE NAME H M S
BELLEISLE PRINTED ON BOTH
FOR TOMMY
AND JACKY CAFFREY WERE TWINS SCARCE FOUR YEARS OLD AND VERY NOISY AND
SPOILED TWINS SOMETIMES BUT FOR ALL THAT DARLING LITTLE FELLOWS WITH
BRIGHT MERRY FACES AND ENDEARING WAYS ABOUT THEM
THEY WERE DABBLING IN
THE SAND WITH THEIR SPADES AND BUCKETS BUILDING CASTLES AS CHILDREN DO
OR PLAYING WITH THEIR BIG COLOURED BALL HAPPY AS THE DAY WAS LONG
AND
EDY BOARDMAN WAS ROCKING THE CHUBBY BABY TO AND FRO IN THE PUSHCAR WHILE
THAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN FAIRLY CHUCKLED WITH DELIGHT
HE WAS BUT ELEVEN
MONTHS AND NINE DAYS OLD AND THOUGH STILL A TINY TODDLER WAS JUST
BEGINNING TO LISP HIS FIRST BABYISH WORDS
CISSY CAFFREY BENT OVER TO
HIM TO TEASE HIS FAT LITTLE PLUCKS AND THE DAINTY DIMPLE IN HIS CHIN
NOW BABY CISSY CAFFREY SAID
SAY OUT BIG BIG
I WANT A DRINK OF
WATER
AND BABY PRATTLED AFTER HER
A JINK A JINK A JAWBO
CISSY CAFFREY CUDDLED THE WEE CHAP FOR SHE WAS AWFULLY FOND OF CHILDREN
SO PATIENT WITH LITTLE SUFFERERS AND TOMMY CAFFREY COULD NEVER BE GOT TO
TAKE HIS CASTOR OIL UNLESS IT WAS CISSY CAFFREY THAT HELD HIS NOSE AND
PROMISED HIM THE SCATTY HEEL OF THE LOAF OR BROWN BREAD WITH GOLDEN
SYRUP ON
WHAT A PERSUASIVE POWER THAT GIRL HAD BUT TO BE SURE BABY
BOARDMAN WAS AS GOOD AS GOLD A PERFECT LITTLE DOTE IN HIS NEW FANCY
BIB
NONE OF YOUR SPOILT BEAUTIES FLORA MACFLIMSY SORT WAS CISSY
CAFFREY
A TRUERHEARTED LASS NEVER DREW THE BREATH OF LIFE ALWAYS WITH
A LAUGH IN HER GIPSYLIKE EYES AND A FROLICSOME WORD ON HER CHERRYRIPE
RED LIPS A GIRL LOVABLE IN THE EXTREME
AND EDY BOARDMAN LAUGHED TOO AT
THE QUAINT LANGUAGE OF LITTLE BROTHER
BUT JUST THEN THERE WAS A SLIGHT ALTERCATION BETWEEN MASTER TOMMY AND
MASTER JACKY
BOYS WILL BE BOYS AND OUR TWO TWINS WERE NO EXCEPTION
TO THIS GOLDEN RULE
THE APPLE OF DISCORD WAS A CERTAIN CASTLE OF SAND
WHICH MASTER JACKY HAD BUILT AND MASTER TOMMY WOULD HAVE IT RIGHT GO
WRONG THAT IT WAS TO BE ARCHITECTURALLY IMPROVED BY A FRONTDOOR LIKE THE
MARTELLO TOWER HAD
BUT IF MASTER TOMMY WAS HEADSTRONG MASTER JACKY WAS
SELFWILLED TOO AND TRUE TO THE MAXIM THAT EVERY LITTLE IRISHMAN'S HOUSE
IS HIS CASTLE HE FELL UPON HIS HATED RIVAL AND TO SUCH PURPOSE THAT THE
WOULDBE ASSAILANT CAME TO GRIEF AND ALAS TO RELATE THE COVETED CASTLE
TOO
NEEDLESS TO SAY THE CRIES OF DISCOMFITED MASTER TOMMY DREW THE
ATTENTION OF THE GIRL FRIENDS
COME HERE TOMMY HIS SISTER CALLED IMPERATIVELY
AT ONCE AND YOU
JACKY FOR SHAME TO THROW POOR TOMMY IN THE DIRTY SAND
WAIT TILL I
CATCH YOU FOR THAT
HIS EYES MISTY WITH UNSHED TEARS MASTER TOMMY CAME AT HER CALL FOR THEIR
BIG SISTER'S WORD WAS LAW WITH THE TWINS
AND IN A SAD PLIGHT HE WAS
TOO AFTER HIS MISADVENTURE
HIS LITTLE MAN O' WAR TOP AND UNMENTIONABLES
WERE FULL OF SAND BUT CISSY WAS A PAST MISTRESS IN THE ART OF SMOOTHING
OVER LIFE'S TINY TROUBLES AND VERY QUICKLY NOT ONE SPECK OF SAND WAS TO
BE SEEN ON HIS SMART LITTLE SUIT
STILL THE BLUE EYES WERE GLISTENING
WITH HOT TEARS THAT WOULD WELL UP SO SHE KISSED AWAY THE HURTNESS AND
SHOOK HER HAND AT MASTER JACKY THE CULPRIT AND SAID IF SHE WAS NEAR HIM
SHE WOULDN'T BE FAR FROM HIM HER EYES DANCING IN ADMONITION
NASTY BOLD JACKY SHE CRIED
SHE PUT AN ARM ROUND THE LITTLE MARINER AND COAXED WINNINGLY
WHAT'S YOUR NAME BUTTER AND CREAM
TELL US WHO IS YOUR SWEETHEART SPOKE EDY BOARDMAN
IS CISSY YOUR
SWEETHEART
NAO TEARFUL TOMMY SAID
IS EDY BOARDMAN YOUR SWEETHEART CISSY QUERIED
NAO TOMMY SAID
I KNOW EDY BOARDMAN SAID NONE TOO AMIABLY WITH AN ARCH GLANCE FROM
HER SHORTSIGHTED EYES
I KNOW WHO IS TOMMY'S SWEETHEART
GERTY IS
TOMMY'S SWEETHEART
NAO TOMMY SAID ON THE VERGE OF TEARS
CISSY'S QUICK MOTHERWIT GUESSED WHAT WAS AMISS AND SHE WHISPERED TO
EDY BOARDMAN TO TAKE HIM THERE BEHIND THE PUSHCAR WHERE THE GENTLEMAN
COULDN'T SEE AND TO MIND HE DIDN'T WET HIS NEW TAN SHOES
BUT WHO WAS GERTY
GERTY MACDOWELL WHO WAS SEATED NEAR HER COMPANIONS LOST IN THOUGHT
GAZING FAR AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE WAS IN VERY TRUTH AS FAIR A SPECIMEN
OF WINSOME IRISH GIRLHOOD AS ONE COULD WISH TO SEE
SHE WAS PRONOUNCED
BEAUTIFUL BY ALL WHO KNEW HER THOUGH AS FOLKS OFTEN SAID SHE WAS
MORE A GILTRAP THAN A MACDOWELL
HER FIGURE WAS SLIGHT AND GRACEFUL
INCLINING EVEN TO FRAGILITY BUT THOSE IRON JELLOIDS SHE HAD BEEN TAKING
OF LATE HAD DONE HER A WORLD OF GOOD MUCH BETTER THAN THE WIDOW WELCH'S
FEMALE PILLS AND SHE WAS MUCH BETTER OF THOSE DISCHARGES SHE USED TO
GET AND THAT TIRED FEELING
THE WAXEN PALLOR OF HER FACE WAS ALMOST
SPIRITUAL IN ITS IVORYLIKE PURITY THOUGH HER ROSEBUD MOUTH WAS A GENUINE
CUPID'S BOW GREEKLY PERFECT
HER HANDS WERE OF FINELY VEINED ALABASTER
WITH TAPERING FINGERS AND AS WHITE AS LEMONJUICE AND QUEEN OF OINTMENTS
COULD MAKE THEM THOUGH IT WAS NOT TRUE THAT SHE USED TO WEAR KID GLOVES
IN BED OR TAKE A MILK FOOTBATH EITHER
BERTHA SUPPLE TOLD THAT ONCE TO
EDY BOARDMAN A DELIBERATE LIE WHEN SHE WAS BLACK OUT AT DAGGERS DRAWN
WITH GERTY THE GIRL CHUMS HAD OF COURSE THEIR LITTLE TIFFS FROM TIME TO
TIME LIKE THE REST OF MORTALS AND SHE TOLD HER NOT TO LET ON WHATEVER
SHE DID THAT IT WAS HER THAT TOLD HER OR SHE'D NEVER SPEAK TO HER
AGAIN
NO
HONOUR WHERE HONOUR IS DUE
THERE WAS AN INNATE REFINEMENT
A LANGUID QUEENLY HAUTEUR ABOUT GERTY WHICH WAS UNMISTAKABLY EVIDENCED
IN HER DELICATE HANDS AND HIGHARCHED INSTEP
HAD KIND FATE BUT WILLED
HER TO BE BORN A GENTLEWOMAN OF HIGH DEGREE IN HER OWN RIGHT AND HAD
SHE ONLY RECEIVED THE BENEFIT OF A GOOD EDUCATION GERTY MACDOWELL MIGHT
EASILY HAVE HELD HER OWN BESIDE ANY LADY IN THE LAND AND HAVE SEEN
HERSELF EXQUISITELY GOWNED WITH JEWELS ON HER BROW AND PATRICIAN SUITORS
AT HER FEET VYING WITH ONE ANOTHER TO PAY THEIR DEVOIRS TO HER
MAYHAP IT WAS THIS THE LOVE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT LENT TO HER
SOFTLYFEATURED FACE AT WHILES A LOOK TENSE WITH SUPPRESSED MEANING
THAT IMPARTED A STRANGE YEARNING TENDENCY TO THE BEAUTIFUL EYES A CHARM
FEW COULD RESIST
WHY HAVE WOMEN SUCH EYES OF WITCHERY GERTY'S WERE OF
THE BLUEST IRISH BLUE SET OFF BY LUSTROUS LASHES AND DARK EXPRESSIVE
BROWS
TIME WAS WHEN THOSE BROWS WERE NOT SO SILKILY SEDUCTIVE
IT
WAS MADAME VERA VERITY DIRECTRESS OF THE WOMAN BEAUTIFUL PAGE OF THE
PRINCESS NOVELETTE WHO HAD FIRST ADVISED HER TO TRY EYEBROWLEINE WHICH
GAVE THAT HAUNTING EXPRESSION TO THE EYES SO BECOMING IN LEADERS
OF FASHION AND SHE HAD NEVER REGRETTED IT
THEN THERE WAS BLUSHING
SCIENTIFICALLY CURED AND HOW TO BE TALL INCREASE YOUR HEIGHT AND YOU
HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FACE BUT YOUR NOSE THAT WOULD SUIT MRS DIGNAM BECAUSE
SHE HAD A BUTTON ONE
BUT GERTY'S CROWNING GLORY WAS HER WEALTH OF
WONDERFUL HAIR
IT WAS DARK BROWN WITH A NATURAL WAVE IN IT
SHE HAD CUT
IT THAT VERY MORNING ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW MOON AND IT NESTLED ABOUT
HER PRETTY HEAD IN A PROFUSION OF LUXURIANT CLUSTERS AND PARED HER NAILS
TOO THURSDAY FOR WEALTH
AND JUST NOW AT EDY'S WORDS AS A TELLTALE
FLUSH DELICATE AS THE FAINTEST ROSEBLOOM CREPT INTO HER CHEEKS SHE
LOOKED SO LOVELY IN HER SWEET GIRLISH SHYNESS THAT OF A SURETY GOD'S
FAIR LAND OF IRELAND DID NOT HOLD HER EQUAL
FOR AN INSTANT SHE WAS SILENT WITH RATHER SAD DOWNCAST EYES
SHE
WAS ABOUT TO RETORT BUT SOMETHING CHECKED THE WORDS ON HER TONGUE
INCLINATION PROMPTED HER TO SPEAK OUT DIGNITY TOLD HER TO BE SILENT
THE PRETTY LIPS POUTED AWHILE BUT THEN SHE GLANCED UP AND BROKE OUT INTO
A JOYOUS LITTLE LAUGH WHICH HAD IN IT ALL THE FRESHNESS OF A YOUNG MAY
MORNING
SHE KNEW RIGHT WELL NO ONE BETTER WHAT MADE SQUINTY EDY
SAY THAT BECAUSE OF HIM COOLING IN HIS ATTENTIONS WHEN IT WAS SIMPLY A
LOVERS' QUARREL
AS PER USUAL SOMEBODY'S NOSE WAS OUT OF JOINT ABOUT THE
BOY THAT HAD THE BICYCLE OFF THE LONDON BRIDGE ROAD ALWAYS RIDING UP
AND DOWN IN FRONT OF HER WINDOW
ONLY NOW HIS FATHER KEPT HIM IN IN THE
EVENINGS STUDYING HARD TO GET AN EXHIBITION IN THE INTERMEDIATE THAT WAS
ON AND HE WAS GOING TO GO TO TRINITY COLLEGE TO STUDY FOR A DOCTOR WHEN
HE LEFT THE HIGH SCHOOL LIKE HIS BROTHER W
E
WYLIE WHO WAS RACING
IN THE BICYCLE RACES IN TRINITY COLLEGE UNIVERSITY
LITTLE RECKED HE
PERHAPS FOR WHAT SHE FELT THAT DULL ACHING VOID IN HER HEART SOMETIMES
PIERCING TO THE CORE
YET HE WAS YOUNG AND PERCHANCE HE MIGHT LEARN
TO LOVE HER IN TIME
THEY WERE PROTESTANTS IN HIS FAMILY AND OF COURSE
GERTY KNEW WHO CAME FIRST AND AFTER HIM THE BLESSED VIRGIN AND THEN
SAINT JOSEPH
BUT HE WAS UNDENIABLY HANDSOME WITH AN EXQUISITE NOSE AND
HE WAS WHAT HE LOOKED EVERY INCH A GENTLEMAN THE SHAPE OF HIS HEAD TOO
AT THE BACK WITHOUT HIS CAP ON THAT SHE WOULD KNOW ANYWHERE SOMETHING
OFF THE COMMON AND THE WAY HE TURNED THE BICYCLE AT THE LAMP WITH HIS
HANDS OFF THE BARS AND ALSO THE NICE PERFUME OF THOSE GOOD CIGARETTES
AND BESIDES THEY WERE BOTH OF A SIZE TOO HE AND SHE AND THAT WAS WHY EDY
BOARDMAN THOUGHT SHE WAS SO FRIGHTFULLY CLEVER BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO AND
RIDE UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF HER BIT OF A GARDEN
GERTY WAS DRESSED SIMPLY BUT WITH THE INSTINCTIVE TASTE OF A VOTARY OF
DAME FASHION FOR SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS JUST A MIGHT THAT HE MIGHT BE
OUT
A NEAT BLOUSE OF ELECTRIC BLUE SELFTINTED BY DOLLY DYES BECAUSE IT
WAS EXPECTED IN THE LADY'S PICTORIAL THAT ELECTRIC BLUE WOULD BE WORN
WITH A SMART VEE OPENING DOWN TO THE DIVISION AND KERCHIEF POCKET IN
WHICH SHE ALWAYS KEPT A PIECE OF COTTONWOOL SCENTED WITH HER
FAVOURITE PERFUME BECAUSE THE HANDKERCHIEF SPOILED THE SIT AND A NAVY
THREEQUARTER SKIRT CUT TO THE STRIDE SHOWED OFF HER SLIM GRACEFUL FIGURE
TO PERFECTION
SHE WORE A COQUETTISH LITTLE LOVE OF A HAT OF WIDELEAVED
NIGGER STRAW CONTRAST TRIMMED WITH AN UNDERBRIM OF EGGBLUE CHENILLE AND
AT THE SIDE A BUTTERFLY BOW OF SILK TO TONE
ALL TUESDAY WEEK AFTERNOON
SHE WAS HUNTING TO MATCH THAT CHENILLE BUT AT LAST SHE FOUND WHAT SHE
WANTED AT CLERY'S SUMMER SALES THE VERY IT SLIGHTLY SHOPSOILED BUT YOU
WOULD NEVER NOTICE SEVEN FINGERS TWO AND A PENNY
SHE DID IT UP ALL BY
HERSELF AND WHAT JOY WAS HERS WHEN SHE TRIED IT ON THEN SMILING AT THE
LOVELY REFLECTION WHICH THE MIRROR GAVE BACK TO HER AND WHEN SHE PUT
IT ON THE WATERJUG TO KEEP THE SHAPE SHE KNEW THAT THAT WOULD TAKE THE
SHINE OUT OF SOME PEOPLE SHE KNEW
HER SHOES WERE THE NEWEST THING IN
FOOTWEAR EDY BOARDMAN PRIDED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS VERY PETITE BUT SHE
NEVER HAD A FOOT LIKE GERTY MACDOWELL A FIVE AND NEVER WOULD ASH
OAK OR ELM WITH PATENT TOECAPS AND JUST ONE SMART BUCKLE OVER
HER HIGHARCHED INSTEP
HER WELLTURNED ANKLE DISPLAYED ITS PERFECT
PROPORTIONS BENEATH HER SKIRT AND JUST THE PROPER AMOUNT AND NO MORE OF
HER SHAPELY LIMBS ENCASED IN FINESPUN HOSE WITH HIGHSPLICED HEELS AND
WIDE GARTER TOPS
AS FOR UNDIES THEY WERE GERTY'S CHIEF CARE AND WHO
THAT KNOWS THE FLUTTERING HOPES AND FEARS OF SWEET SEVENTEEN THOUGH
GERTY WOULD NEVER SEE SEVENTEEN AGAIN CAN FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO
BLAME HER SHE HAD FOUR DINKY SETS WITH AWFULLY PRETTY STITCHERY
THREE GARMENTS AND NIGHTIES EXTRA AND EACH SET SLOTTED WITH DIFFERENT
COLOURED RIBBONS ROSEPINK PALE BLUE MAUVE AND PEAGREEN AND SHE AIRED
THEM HERSELF AND BLUED THEM WHEN THEY CAME HOME FROM THE WASH AND IRONED
THEM AND SHE HAD A BRICKBAT TO KEEP THE IRON ON BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T
TRUST THOSE WASHERWOMEN AS FAR AS SHE'D SEE THEM SCORCHING THE THINGS
SHE WAS WEARING THE BLUE FOR LUCK HOPING AGAINST HOPE HER OWN COLOUR
AND LUCKY TOO FOR A BRIDE TO HAVE A BIT OF BLUE SOMEWHERE ON HER BECAUSE
THE GREEN SHE WORE THAT DAY WEEK BROUGHT GRIEF BECAUSE HIS FATHER
BROUGHT HIM IN TO STUDY FOR THE INTERMEDIATE EXHIBITION AND BECAUSE
SHE THOUGHT PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE OUT BECAUSE WHEN SHE WAS DRESSING THAT
MORNING SHE NEARLY SLIPPED UP THE OLD PAIR ON HER INSIDE OUT AND THAT
WAS FOR LUCK AND LOVERS' MEETING IF YOU PUT THOSE THINGS ON INSIDE
OUT OR IF THEY GOT UNTIED THAT HE WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU SO LONG AS IT
WASN'T OF A FRIDAY
AND YET AND YET THAT STRAINED LOOK ON HER FACE A GNAWING SORROW IS
THERE ALL THE TIME
HER VERY SOUL IS IN HER EYES AND SHE WOULD GIVE
WORLDS TO BE IN THE PRIVACY OF HER OWN FAMILIAR CHAMBER WHERE
GIVING WAY TO TEARS SHE COULD HAVE A GOOD CRY AND RELIEVE HER PENTUP
FEELINGSTHOUGH NOT TOO MUCH BECAUSE SHE KNEW HOW TO CRY NICELY BEFORE
THE MIRROR
YOU ARE LOVELY GERTY IT SAID
THE PALY LIGHT OF EVENING
FALLS UPON A FACE INFINITELY SAD AND WISTFUL
GERTY MACDOWELL YEARNS
IN VAIN
YES SHE HAD KNOWN FROM THE VERY FIRST THAT HER DAYDREAM OF A
MARRIAGE HAS BEEN ARRANGED AND THE WEDDINGBELLS RINGING FOR MRS REGGY
WYLIE T
C
D
BECAUSE THE ONE WHO MARRIED THE ELDER BROTHER WOULD BE
MRS WYLIE AND IN THE FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE MRS GERTRUDE WYLIE WAS
WEARING A SUMPTUOUS CONFECTION OF GREY TRIMMED WITH EXPENSIVE BLUE FOX
WAS NOT TO BE
HE WAS TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND
HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IN
LOVE A WOMAN'S BIRTHRIGHT
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY LONG AGO IN STOER'S
HE WAS STILL IN SHORT TROUSERS WHEN THEY WERE ALONE AND HE STOLE
AN ARM ROUND HER WAIST SHE WENT WHITE TO THE VERY LIPS
HE CALLED HER
LITTLE ONE IN A STRANGELY HUSKY VOICE AND SNATCHED A HALF KISS THE
FIRST BUT IT WAS ONLY THE END OF HER NOSE AND THEN HE HASTENED FROM
THE ROOM WITH A REMARK ABOUT REFRESHMENTS
IMPETUOUS FELLOW STRENGTH OF
CHARACTER HAD NEVER BEEN REGGY WYLIE'S STRONG POINT AND HE WHO WOULD
WOO AND WIN GERTY MACDOWELL MUST BE A MAN AMONG MEN
BUT WAITING ALWAYS
WAITING TO BE ASKED AND IT WAS LEAP YEAR TOO AND WOULD SOON BE OVER
NO
PRINCE CHARMING IS HER BEAU IDEAL TO LAY A RARE AND WONDROUS LOVE AT HER
FEET BUT RATHER A MANLY MAN WITH A STRONG QUIET FACE WHO HAD NOT FOUND
HIS IDEAL PERHAPS HIS HAIR SLIGHTLY FLECKED WITH GREY AND WHO WOULD
UNDERSTAND TAKE HER IN HIS SHELTERING ARMS STRAIN HER TO HIM IN ALL
THE STRENGTH OF HIS DEEP PASSIONATE NATURE AND COMFORT HER WITH A LONG
LONG KISS
IT WOULD BE LIKE HEAVEN
FOR SUCH A ONE SHE YEARNS THIS BALMY
SUMMER EVE
WITH ALL THE HEART OF HER SHE LONGS TO BE HIS ONLY HIS
AFFIANCED BRIDE FOR RICHES FOR POOR IN SICKNESS IN HEALTH TILL DEATH
US TWO PART FROM THIS TO THIS DAY FORWARD
AND WHILE EDY BOARDMAN WAS WITH LITTLE TOMMY BEHIND THE PUSHCAR SHE WAS
JUST THINKING WOULD THE DAY EVER COME WHEN SHE COULD CALL HERSELF HIS
LITTLE WIFE TO BE
THEN THEY COULD TALK ABOUT HER TILL THEY WENT BLUE IN
THE FACE BERTHA SUPPLE TOO AND EDY LITTLE SPITFIRE BECAUSE SHE WOULD
BE TWENTYTWO IN NOVEMBER
SHE WOULD CARE FOR HIM WITH CREATURE COMFORTS
TOO FOR GERTY WAS WOMANLY WISE AND KNEW THAT A MERE MAN LIKED THAT
FEELING OF HOMINESS
HER GRIDDLECAKES DONE TO A GOLDENBROWN HUE AND
QUEEN ANN'S PUDDING OF DELIGHTFUL CREAMINESS HAD WON GOLDEN OPINIONS
FROM ALL BECAUSE SHE HAD A LUCKY HAND ALSO FOR LIGHTING A FIRE DREDGE
IN THE FINE SELFRAISING FLOUR AND ALWAYS STIR IN THE SAME DIRECTION
THEN CREAM THE MILK AND SUGAR AND WHISK WELL THE WHITE OF EGGS THOUGH
SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE EATING PART WHEN THERE WERE ANY PEOPLE THAT MADE HER
SHY AND OFTEN SHE WONDERED WHY YOU COULDN'T EAT SOMETHING POETICAL LIKE
VIOLETS OR ROSES AND THEY WOULD HAVE A BEAUTIFULLY APPOINTED DRAWINGROOM
WITH PICTURES AND ENGRAVINGS AND THE PHOTOGRAPH OF GRANDPAPA GILTRAP'S
LOVELY DOG GARRYOWEN THAT ALMOST TALKED IT WAS SO HUMAN AND CHINTZ
COVERS FOR THE CHAIRS AND THAT SILVER TOASTRACK IN CLERY'S SUMMER
JUMBLE SALES LIKE THEY HAVE IN RICH HOUSES
HE WOULD BE TALL WITH
BROAD SHOULDERS SHE HAD ALWAYS ADMIRED TALL MEN FOR A HUSBAND WITH
GLISTENING WHITE TEETH UNDER HIS CAREFULLY TRIMMED SWEEPING MOUSTACHE
AND THEY WOULD GO ON THE CONTINENT FOR THEIR HONEYMOON THREE WONDERFUL
WEEKS AND THEN WHEN THEY SETTLED DOWN IN A NICE SNUG AND COSY LITTLE
HOMELY HOUSE EVERY MORNING THEY WOULD BOTH HAVE BREKKY SIMPLE BUT
PERFECTLY SERVED FOR THEIR OWN TWO SELVES AND BEFORE HE WENT OUT TO
BUSINESS HE WOULD GIVE HIS DEAR LITTLE WIFEY A GOOD HEARTY HUG AND GAZE
FOR A MOMENT DEEP DOWN INTO HER EYES
EDY BOARDMAN ASKED TOMMY CAFFREY WAS HE DONE AND HE SAID YES SO THEN SHE
BUTTONED UP HIS LITTLE KNICKERBOCKERS FOR HIM AND TOLD HIM TO RUN OFF
AND PLAY WITH JACKY AND TO BE GOOD NOW AND NOT TO FIGHT
BUT TOMMY SAID
HE WANTED THE BALL AND EDY TOLD HIM NO THAT BABY WAS PLAYING WITH THE
BALL AND IF HE TOOK IT THERE'D BE WIGS ON THE GREEN BUT TOMMY SAID IT
WAS HIS BALL AND HE WANTED HIS BALL AND HE PRANCED ON THE GROUND IF
YOU PLEASE
THE TEMPER OF HIM O HE WAS A MAN ALREADY WAS LITTLE TOMMY
CAFFREY SINCE HE WAS OUT OF PINNIES
EDY TOLD HIM NO NO AND TO BE OFF
NOW WITH HIM AND SHE TOLD CISSY CAFFREY NOT TO GIVE IN TO HIM
YOU'RE NOT MY SISTER NAUGHTY TOMMY SAID
IT'S MY BALL
BUT CISSY CAFFREY TOLD BABY BOARDMAN TO LOOK UP LOOK UP HIGH AT HER
FINGER AND SHE SNATCHED THE BALL QUICKLY AND THREW IT ALONG THE SAND AND
TOMMY AFTER IT IN FULL CAREER HAVING WON THE DAY
ANYTHING FOR A QUIET LIFE LAUGHED CISS
AND SHE TICKLED TINY TOT'S TWO CHEEKS TO MAKE HIM FORGET AND PLAYED
HERE'S THE LORD MAYOR HERE'S HIS TWO HORSES HERE'S HIS GINGERBREAD
CARRIAGE AND HERE HE WALKS IN CHINCHOPPER CHINCHOPPER CHINCHOPPER
CHIN
BUT EDY GOT AS CROSS AS TWO STICKS ABOUT HIM GETTING HIS OWN WAY
LIKE THAT FROM EVERYONE ALWAYS PETTING HIM
I'D LIKE TO GIVE HIM SOMETHING SHE SAID SO I WOULD WHERE I WON'T
SAY
ON THE BEEOTEETOM LAUGHED CISSY MERRILY
GERTY MACDOWELL BENT DOWN HER HEAD AND CRIMSONED AT THE IDEA OF CISSY
SAYING AN UNLADYLIKE THING LIKE THAT OUT LOUD SHE'D BE ASHAMED OF HER
LIFE TO SAY FLUSHING A DEEP ROSY RED AND EDY BOARDMAN SAID SHE WAS
SURE THE GENTLEMAN OPPOSITE HEARD WHAT SHE SAID
BUT NOT A PIN CARED
CISS
LET HIM SHE SAID WITH A PERT TOSS OF HER HEAD AND A PIQUANT TILT OF
HER NOSE
GIVE IT TO HIM TOO ON THE SAME PLACE AS QUICK AS I'D LOOK AT
HIM
MADCAP CISS WITH HER GOLLIWOG CURLS
YOU HAD TO LAUGH AT HER SOMETIMES
FOR INSTANCE WHEN SHE ASKED YOU WOULD YOU HAVE SOME MORE CHINESE TEA AND
JASPBERRY RAM AND WHEN SHE DREW THE JUGS TOO AND THE MEN'S FACES ON HER
NAILS WITH RED INK MAKE YOU SPLIT YOUR SIDES OR WHEN SHE WANTED TO GO
WHERE YOU KNOW SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO RUN AND PAY A VISIT TO THE MISS
WHITE
THAT WAS JUST LIKE CISSYCUMS
O AND WILL YOU EVER FORGET HER THE
EVENING SHE DRESSED UP IN HER FATHER'S SUIT AND HAT AND THE BURNED CORK
MOUSTACHE AND WALKED DOWN TRITONVILLE ROAD SMOKING A CIGARETTE
THERE
WAS NONE TO COME UP TO HER FOR FUN
BUT SHE WAS SINCERITY ITSELF ONE OF
THE BRAVEST AND TRUEST HEARTS HEAVEN EVER MADE NOT ONE OF YOUR TWOFACED
THINGS TOO SWEET TO BE WHOLESOME
AND THEN THERE CAME OUT UPON THE AIR THE SOUND OF VOICES AND THE PEALING
ANTHEM OF THE ORGAN
IT WAS THE MEN'S TEMPERANCE RETREAT CONDUCTED
BY THE MISSIONER THE REVEREND JOHN HUGHES S
J ROSARY SERMON AND
BENEDICTION OF THE MOST BLESSED SACRAMENT
THEY WERE THERE GATHERED
TOGETHER WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF SOCIAL CLASS AND A MOST EDIFYING
SPECTACLE IT WAS TO SEE IN THAT SIMPLE FANE BESIDE THE WAVES AFTER THE
STORMS OF THIS WEARY WORLD KNEELING BEFORE THE FEET OF THE IMMACULATE
RECITING THE LITANY OF OUR LADY OF LORETO BESEECHING HER TO INTERCEDE
FOR THEM THE OLD FAMILIAR WORDS HOLY MARY HOLY VIRGIN OF VIRGINS
HOW
SAD TO POOR GERTY'S EARS HAD HER FATHER ONLY AVOIDED THE CLUTCHES OF
THE DEMON DRINK BY TAKING THE PLEDGE OR THOSE POWDERS THE DRINK HABIT
CURED IN PEARSON'S WEEKLY SHE MIGHT NOW BE ROLLING IN HER CARRIAGE
SECOND TO NONE
OVER AND OVER HAD SHE TOLD HERSELF THAT AS SHE MUSED BY
THE DYING EMBERS IN A BROWN STUDY WITHOUT THE LAMP BECAUSE SHE HATED TWO
LIGHTS OR OFTENTIMES GAZING OUT OF THE WINDOW DREAMILY BY THE HOUR AT
THE RAIN FALLING ON THE RUSTY BUCKET THINKING
BUT THAT VILE DECOCTION
WHICH HAS RUINED SO MANY HEARTHS AND HOMES HAD CIST ITS SHADOW OVER HER
CHILDHOOD DAYS
NAY SHE HAD EVEN WITNESSED IN THE HOME CIRCLE DEEDS OF
VIOLENCE CAUSED BY INTEMPERANCE AND HAD SEEN HER OWN FATHER A PREY TO
THE FUMES OF INTOXICATION FORGET HIMSELF COMPLETELY FOR IF THERE WAS
ONE THING OF ALL THINGS THAT GERTY KNEW IT WAS THAT THE MAN WHO LIFTS
HIS HAND TO A WOMAN SAVE IN THE WAY OF KINDNESS DESERVES TO BE BRANDED
AS THE LOWEST OF THE LOW
AND STILL THE VOICES SANG IN SUPPLICATION TO THE VIRGIN MOST POWERFUL
VIRGIN MOST MERCIFUL
AND GERTY RAPT IN THOUGHT SCARCE SAW OR HEARD
HER COMPANIONS OR THE TWINS AT THEIR BOYISH GAMBOLS OR THE GENTLEMAN
OFF SANDYMOUNT GREEN THAT CISSY CAFFREY CALLED THE MAN THAT WAS SO LIKE
HIMSELF PASSING ALONG THE STRAND TAKING A SHORT WALK
YOU NEVER SAW HIM
ANY WAY SCREWED BUT STILL AND FOR ALL THAT SHE WOULD NOT LIKE HIM FOR A
FATHER BECAUSE HE WAS TOO OLD OR SOMETHING OR ON ACCOUNT OF HIS FACE
IT WAS A PALPABLE CASE OF DOCTOR FELL OR HIS CARBUNCLY NOSE WITH THE
PIMPLES ON IT AND HIS SANDY MOUSTACHE A BIT WHITE UNDER HIS NOSE
POOR
FATHER WITH ALL HIS FAULTS SHE LOVED HIM STILL WHEN HE SANG TELL ME
MARY HOW TO WOO THEE OR MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE AND THEY
HAD STEWED COCKLES AND LETTUCE WITH LAZENBY'S SALAD DRESSING FOR
SUPPER AND WHEN HE SANG THE MOON HATH RAISED WITH MR DIGNAM THAT
DIED SUDDENLY AND WAS BURIED GOD HAVE MERCY ON HIM FROM A STROKE
HER
MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY THAT WAS AND CHARLEY WAS HOME ON HIS HOLIDAYS AND TOM
AND MR DIGNAM AND MRS AND PATSY AND FREDDY DIGNAM AND THEY WERE TO HAVE
HAD A GROUP TAKEN
NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE END WAS SO NEAR
NOW HE
WAS LAID TO REST
AND HER MOTHER SAID TO HIM TO LET THAT BE A WARNING TO
HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS DAYS AND HE COULDN'T EVEN GO TO THE FUNERAL ON
ACCOUNT OF THE GOUT AND SHE HAD TO GO INTO TOWN TO BRING HIM THE
LETTERS AND SAMPLES FROM HIS OFFICE ABOUT CATESBY'S CORK LINO ARTISTIC
STANDARD DESIGNS FIT FOR A PALACE GIVES TIPTOP WEAR AND ALWAYS BRIGHT
AND CHEERY IN THE HOME
A STERLING GOOD DAUGHTER WAS GERTY JUST LIKE A SECOND MOTHER IN THE
HOUSE A MINISTERING ANGEL TOO WITH A LITTLE HEART WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN
GOLD
AND WHEN HER MOTHER HAD THOSE RAGING SPLITTING HEADACHES WHO WAS
IT RUBBED THE MENTHOL CONE ON HER FOREHEAD BUT GERTY THOUGH SHE DIDN'T
LIKE HER MOTHER'S TAKING PINCHES OF SNUFF AND THAT WAS THE ONLY SINGLE
THING THEY EVER HAD WORDS ABOUT TAKING SNUFF
EVERYONE THOUGHT THE
WORLD OF HER FOR HER GENTLE WAYS
IT WAS GERTY WHO TURNED OFF THE GAS AT
THE MAIN EVERY NIGHT AND IT WAS GERTY WHO TACKED UP ON THE WALL OF THAT
PLACE WHERE SHE NEVER FORGOT EVERY FORTNIGHT THE CHLORATE OF LIME MR
TUNNEY THE GROCER'S CHRISTMAS ALMANAC THE PICTURE OF HALCYON DAYS
WHERE A YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THE COSTUME THEY USED TO WEAR THEN WITH A
THREECORNERED HAT WAS OFFERING A BUNCH OF FLOWERS TO HIS LADYLOVE WITH
OLDTIME CHIVALRY THROUGH HER LATTICE WINDOW
YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS A
STORY BEHIND IT
THE COLOURS WERE DONE SOMETHING LOVELY
SHE WAS IN
A SOFT CLINGING WHITE IN A STUDIED ATTITUDE AND THE GENTLEMAN WAS IN
CHOCOLATE AND HE LOOKED A THOROUGH ARISTOCRAT
SHE OFTEN LOOKED AT THEM
DREAMILY WHEN SHE WENT THERE FOR A CERTAIN PURPOSE AND FELT HER OWN
ARMS THAT WERE WHITE AND SOFT JUST LIKE HERS WITH THE SLEEVES BACK
AND THOUGHT ABOUT THOSE TIMES BECAUSE SHE HAD FOUND OUT IN WALKER'S
PRONOUNCING DICTIONARY THAT BELONGED TO GRANDPAPA GILTRAP ABOUT THE
HALCYON DAYS WHAT THEY MEANT
THE TWINS WERE NOW PLAYING IN THE MOST APPROVED BROTHERLY FASHION
TILL AT LAST MASTER JACKY WHO WAS REALLY AS BOLD AS BRASS THERE WAS
NO GETTING BEHIND THAT DELIBERATELY KICKED THE BALL AS HARD AS EVER HE
COULD DOWN TOWARDS THE SEAWEEDY ROCKS
NEEDLESS TO SAY POOR TOMMY WAS
NOT SLOW TO VOICE HIS DISMAY BUT LUCKILY THE GENTLEMAN IN BLACK WHO WAS
SITTING THERE BY HIMSELF CAME GALLANTLY TO THE RESCUE AND INTERCEPTED
THE BALL
OUR TWO CHAMPIONS CLAIMED THEIR PLAYTHING WITH LUSTY CRIES AND
TO AVOID TROUBLE CISSY CAFFREY CALLED TO THE GENTLEMAN TO THROW IT TO
HER PLEASE
THE GENTLEMAN AIMED THE BALL ONCE OR TWICE AND THEN THREW
IT UP THE STRAND TOWARDS CISSY CAFFREY BUT IT ROLLED DOWN THE SLOPE AND
STOPPED RIGHT UNDER GERTY'S SKIRT NEAR THE LITTLE POOL BY THE ROCK
THE
TWINS CLAMOURED AGAIN FOR IT AND CISSY TOLD HER TO KICK IT AWAY AND
LET THEM FIGHT FOR IT SO GERTY DREW BACK HER FOOT BUT SHE WISHED THEIR
STUPID BALL HADN'T COME ROLLING DOWN TO HER AND SHE GAVE A KICK BUT SHE
MISSED AND EDY AND CISSY LAUGHED
IF YOU FAIL TRY AGAIN EDY BOARDMAN SAID
GERTY SMILED ASSENT AND BIT HER LIP
A DELICATE PINK CREPT INTO HER
PRETTY CHEEK BUT SHE WAS DETERMINED TO LET THEM SEE SO SHE JUST LIFTED
HER SKIRT A LITTLE BUT JUST ENOUGH AND TOOK GOOD AIM AND GAVE THE BALL A
JOLLY GOOD KICK AND IT WENT EVER SO FAR AND THE TWO TWINS AFTER IT DOWN
TOWARDS THE SHINGLE
PURE JEALOUSY OF COURSE IT WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DRAW
ATTENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE GENTLEMAN OPPOSITE LOOKING
SHE FELT THE
WARM FLUSH A DANGER SIGNAL ALWAYS WITH GERTY MACDOWELL SURGING AND
FLAMING INTO HER CHEEKS
TILL THEN THEY HAD ONLY EXCHANGED GLANCES OF
THE MOST CASUAL BUT NOW UNDER THE BRIM OF HER NEW HAT SHE VENTURED A
LOOK AT HIM AND THE FACE THAT MET HER GAZE THERE IN THE TWILIGHT WAN
AND STRANGELY DRAWN SEEMED TO HER THE SADDEST SHE HAD EVER SEEN
THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE CHURCH THE FRAGRANT INCENSE WAS WAFTED
AND WITH IT THE FRAGRANT NAMES OF HER WHO WAS CONCEIVED WITHOUT STAIN OF
ORIGINAL SIN SPIRITUAL VESSEL PRAY FOR US HONOURABLE VESSEL PRAY
FOR US VESSEL OF SINGULAR DEVOTION PRAY FOR US MYSTICAL ROSE
AND
CAREWORN HEARTS WERE THERE AND TOILERS FOR THEIR DAILY BREAD AND MANY
WHO HAD ERRED AND WANDERED THEIR EYES WET WITH CONTRITION BUT FOR ALL
THAT BRIGHT WITH HOPE FOR THE REVEREND FATHER FATHER HUGHES HAD TOLD
THEM WHAT THE GREAT SAINT BERNARD SAID IN HIS FAMOUS PRAYER OF MARY THE
MOST PIOUS VIRGIN'S INTERCESSORY POWER THAT IT WAS NOT RECORDED IN ANY
AGE THAT THOSE WHO IMPLORED HER POWERFUL PROTECTION WERE EVER ABANDONED
BY HER
THE TWINS WERE NOW PLAYING AGAIN RIGHT MERRILY FOR THE TROUBLES OF
CHILDHOOD ARE BUT AS FLEETING SUMMER SHOWERS
CISSY CAFFREY PLAYED WITH
BABY BOARDMAN TILL HE CROWED WITH GLEE CLAPPING BABY HANDS IN AIR
PEEP
SHE CRIED BEHIND THE HOOD OF THE PUSHCAR AND EDY ASKED WHERE WAS CISSY
GONE AND THEN CISSY POPPED UP HER HEAD AND CRIED AH AND MY WORD
DIDN'T THE LITTLE CHAP ENJOY THAT AND THEN SHE TOLD HIM TO SAY PAPA
SAY PAPA BABY
SAY PA PA PA PA PA PA PA
AND BABY DID HIS LEVEL BEST TO SAY IT FOR HE WAS VERY INTELLIGENT FOR
ELEVEN MONTHS EVERYONE SAID AND BIG FOR HIS AGE AND THE PICTURE OF
HEALTH A PERFECT LITTLE BUNCH OF LOVE AND HE WOULD CERTAINLY TURN OUT
TO BE SOMETHING GREAT THEY SAID
HAJA JA JA HAJA
CISSY WIPED HIS LITTLE MOUTH WITH THE DRIBBLING BIB AND WANTED HIM TO
SIT UP PROPERLY AND SAY PA PA PA BUT WHEN SHE UNDID THE STRAP SHE CRIED
OUT HOLY SAINT DENIS THAT HE WAS POSSING WET AND TO DOUBLE THE HALF
BLANKET THE OTHER WAY UNDER HIM
OF COURSE HIS INFANT MAJESTY WAS MOST
OBSTREPEROUS AT SUCH TOILET FORMALITIES AND HE LET EVERYONE KNOW IT
HABAA BAAAAHABAAA BAAAA
AND TWO GREAT BIG LOVELY BIG TEARS COURSING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
IT WAS ALL
NO USE SOOTHERING HIM WITH NO NONO BABY NO AND TELLING HIM ABOUT THE
GEEGEE AND WHERE WAS THE PUFFPUFF BUT CISS ALWAYS READYWITTED GAVE
HIM IN HIS MOUTH THE TEAT OF THE SUCKINGBOTTLE AND THE YOUNG HEATHEN WAS
QUICKLY APPEASED
GERTY WISHED TO GOODNESS THEY WOULD TAKE THEIR SQUALLING BABY HOME OUT
OF THAT AND NOT GET ON HER NERVES NO HOUR TO BE OUT AND THE LITTLE
BRATS OF TWINS
SHE GAZED OUT TOWARDS THE DISTANT SEA
IT WAS LIKE THE
PAINTINGS THAT MAN USED TO DO ON THE PAVEMENT WITH ALL THE COLOURED
CHALKS AND SUCH A PITY TOO LEAVING THEM THERE TO BE ALL BLOTTED OUT THE
EVENING AND THE CLOUDS COMING OUT AND THE BAILEY LIGHT ON HOWTH AND TO
HEAR THE MUSIC LIKE THAT AND THE PERFUME OF THOSE INCENSE THEY BURNED
IN THE CHURCH LIKE A KIND OF WAFT
AND WHILE SHE GAZED HER HEART WENT
PITAPAT
YES IT WAS HER HE WAS LOOKING AT AND THERE WAS MEANING IN HIS
LOOK
HIS EYES BURNED INTO HER AS THOUGH THEY WOULD SEARCH HER THROUGH
AND THROUGH READ HER VERY SOUL
WONDERFUL EYES THEY WERE SUPERBLY
EXPRESSIVE BUT COULD YOU TRUST THEM PEOPLE WERE SO QUEER
SHE COULD
SEE AT ONCE BY HIS DARK EYES AND HIS PALE INTELLECTUAL FACE THAT HE
WAS A FOREIGNER THE IMAGE OF THE PHOTO SHE HAD OF MARTIN HARVEY THE
MATINEE IDOL ONLY FOR THE MOUSTACHE WHICH SHE PREFERRED BECAUSE SHE
WASN'T STAGESTRUCK LIKE WINNY RIPPINGHAM THAT WANTED THEY TWO TO ALWAYS
DRESS THE SAME ON ACCOUNT OF A PLAY BUT SHE COULD NOT SEE WHETHER HE HAD
AN AQUILINE NOSE OR A SLIGHTLY RETROUSS FROM WHERE HE WAS SITTING
HE WAS IN DEEP MOURNING SHE COULD SEE THAT AND THE STORY OF A HAUNTING
SORROW WAS WRITTEN ON HIS FACE
SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WORLDS TO KNOW WHAT
IT WAS
HE WAS LOOKING UP SO INTENTLY SO STILL AND HE SAW HER KICK THE
BALL AND PERHAPS HE COULD SEE THE BRIGHT STEEL BUCKLES OF HER SHOES IF
SHE SWUNG THEM LIKE THAT THOUGHTFULLY WITH THE TOES DOWN
SHE WAS GLAD
THAT SOMETHING TOLD HER TO PUT ON THE TRANSPARENT STOCKINGS THINKING
REGGY WYLIE MIGHT BE OUT BUT THAT WAS FAR AWAY
HERE WAS THAT OF WHICH
SHE HAD SO OFTEN DREAMED
IT WAS HE WHO MATTERED AND THERE WAS JOY ON
HER FACE BECAUSE SHE WANTED HIM BECAUSE SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT HE
WAS LIKE NO ONE ELSE
THE VERY HEART OF THE GIRLWOMAN WENT OUT TO HIM
HER DREAMHUSBAND BECAUSE SHE KNEW ON THE INSTANT IT WAS HIM
IF HE HAD
SUFFERED MORE SINNED AGAINST THAN SINNING OR EVEN EVEN IF HE HAD
BEEN HIMSELF A SINNER A WICKED MAN SHE CARED NOT
EVEN IF HE WAS A
PROTESTANT OR METHODIST SHE COULD CONVERT HIM EASILY IF HE TRULY LOVED
HER
THERE WERE WOUNDS THAT WANTED HEALING WITH HEARTBALM
SHE WAS A
WOMANLY WOMAN NOT LIKE OTHER FLIGHTY GIRLS UNFEMININE HE HAD KNOWN
THOSE CYCLISTS SHOWING OFF WHAT THEY HADN'T GOT AND SHE JUST YEARNED TO
KNOW ALL TO FORGIVE ALL IF SHE COULD MAKE HIM FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
MAKE HIM FORGET THE MEMORY OF THE PAST
THEN MAYHAP HE WOULD EMBRACE HER
GENTLY LIKE A REAL MAN CRUSHING HER SOFT BODY TO HIM AND LOVE HER
HIS OWNEST GIRLIE FOR HERSELF ALONE
REFUGE OF SINNERS
COMFORTRESS OF THE AFFLICTED
ORA PRO NOBIS
WELL
HAS IT BEEN SAID THAT WHOSOEVER PRAYS TO HER WITH FAITH AND CONSTANCY
CAN NEVER BE LOST OR CAST AWAY AND FITLY IS SHE TOO A HAVEN OF REFUGE
FOR THE AFFLICTED BECAUSE OF THE SEVEN DOLOURS WHICH TRANSPIERCED
HER OWN HEART
GERTY COULD PICTURE THE WHOLE SCENE IN THE CHURCH THE
STAINED GLASS WINDOWS LIGHTED UP THE CANDLES THE FLOWERS AND THE BLUE
BANNERS OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN'S SODALITY AND FATHER CONROY WAS HELPING
CANON O'HANLON AT THE ALTAR CARRYING THINGS IN AND OUT WITH HIS EYES
CAST DOWN
HE LOOKED ALMOST A SAINT AND HIS CONFESSIONBOX WAS SO QUIET
AND CLEAN AND DARK AND HIS HANDS WERE JUST LIKE WHITE WAX AND IF EVER
SHE BECAME A DOMINICAN NUN IN THEIR WHITE HABIT PERHAPS HE MIGHT COME TO
THE CONVENT FOR THE NOVENA OF SAINT DOMINIC
HE TOLD HER THAT TIME WHEN
SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT IN CONFESSION CRIMSONING UP TO THE ROOTS OF HER
HAIR FOR FEAR HE COULD SEE NOT TO BE TROUBLED BECAUSE THAT WAS ONLY THE
VOICE OF NATURE AND WE WERE ALL SUBJECT TO NATURE'S LAWS HE SAID IN
THIS LIFE AND THAT THAT WAS NO SIN BECAUSE THAT CAME FROM THE NATURE OF
WOMAN INSTITUTED BY GOD HE SAID AND THAT OUR BLESSED LADY HERSELF SAID
TO THE ARCHANGEL GABRIEL BE IT DONE UNTO ME ACCORDING TO THY WORD
HE
WAS SO KIND AND HOLY AND OFTEN AND OFTEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT COULD
SHE WORK A RUCHED TEACOSY WITH EMBROIDERED FLORAL DESIGN FOR HIM AS A
PRESENT OR A CLOCK BUT THEY HAD A CLOCK SHE NOTICED ON THE MANTELPIECE
WHITE AND GOLD WITH A CANARYBIRD THAT CAME OUT OF A LITTLE HOUSE TO TELL
THE TIME THE DAY SHE WENT THERE ABOUT THE FLOWERS FOR THE FORTY HOURS'
ADORATION BECAUSE IT WAS HARD TO KNOW WHAT SORT OF A PRESENT TO GIVE OR
PERHAPS AN ALBUM OF ILLUMINATED VIEWS OF DUBLIN OR SOME PLACE
THE EXASPERATING LITTLE BRATS OF TWINS BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND JACKY
THREW THE BALL OUT TOWARDS THE SEA AND THEY BOTH RAN AFTER IT
LITTLE
MONKEYS COMMON AS DITCHWATER
SOMEONE OUGHT TO TAKE THEM AND GIVE THEM
A GOOD HIDING FOR THEMSELVES TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR PLACES THE BOTH OF
THEM
AND CISSY AND EDY SHOUTED AFTER THEM TO COME BACK BECAUSE THEY
WERE AFRAID THE TIDE MIGHT COME IN ON THEM AND BE DROWNED
JACKY TOMMY
NOT THEY WHAT A GREAT NOTION THEY HAD SO CISSY SAID IT WAS THE VERY
LAST TIME SHE'D EVER BRING THEM OUT
SHE JUMPED UP AND CALLED THEM AND
SHE RAN DOWN THE SLOPE PAST HIM TOSSING HER HAIR BEHIND HER WHICH HAD
A GOOD ENOUGH COLOUR IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE OF IT BUT WITH ALL THE
THINGAMERRY SHE WAS ALWAYS RUBBING INTO IT SHE COULDN'T GET IT TO GROW
LONG BECAUSE IT WASN'T NATURAL SO SHE COULD JUST GO AND THROW HER HAT AT
IT
SHE RAN WITH LONG GANDERY STRIDES IT WAS A WONDER SHE DIDN'T RIP UP
HER SKIRT AT THE SIDE THAT WAS TOO TIGHT ON HER BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT
OF THE TOMBOY ABOUT CISSY CAFFREY AND SHE WAS A FORWARD PIECE WHENEVER
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW AND JUST BECAUSE SHE WAS
A GOOD RUNNER SHE RAN LIKE THAT SO THAT HE COULD SEE ALL THE END OF HER
PETTICOAT RUNNING AND HER SKINNY SHANKS UP AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
IT
WOULD HAVE SERVED HER JUST RIGHT IF SHE HAD TRIPPED UP OVER SOMETHING
ACCIDENTALLY ON PURPOSE WITH HER HIGH CROOKED FRENCH HEELS ON HER TO
MAKE HER LOOK TALL AND GOT A FINE TUMBLE
TABLEAU THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN A VERY CHARMING EXPOSE FOR A GENTLEMAN LIKE THAT TO WITNESS
QUEEN OF ANGELS QUEEN OF PATRIARCHS QUEEN OF PROPHETS OF ALL SAINTS
THEY PRAYED QUEEN OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY AND THEN FATHER CONROY HANDED
THE THURIBLE TO CANON O'HANLON AND HE PUT IN THE INCENSE AND CENSED THE
BLESSED SACRAMENT AND CISSY CAFFREY CAUGHT THE TWO TWINS AND SHE WAS
ITCHING TO GIVE THEM A RINGING GOOD CLIP ON THE EAR BUT SHE DIDN'T
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE WATCHING BUT SHE NEVER MADE A BIGGER
MISTAKE IN ALL HER LIFE BECAUSE GERTY COULD SEE WITHOUT LOOKING THAT
HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF OF HER AND THEN CANON O'HANLON HANDED THE
THURIBLE BACK TO FATHER CONROY AND KNELT DOWN LOOKING UP AT THE BLESSED
SACRAMENT AND THE CHOIR BEGAN TO SING THE TANTUM ERGO AND SHE JUST
SWUNG HER FOOT IN AND OUT IN TIME AS THE MUSIC ROSE AND FELL TO
THE TANTUMER GOSA CRAMEN TUM
THREE AND ELEVEN SHE PAID FOR THOSE
STOCKINGS IN SPARROW'S OF GEORGE'S STREET ON THE TUESDAY NO THE MONDAY
BEFORE EASTER AND THERE WASN'T A BRACK ON THEM AND THAT WAS WHAT HE
WAS LOOKING AT TRANSPARENT AND NOT AT HER INSIGNIFICANT ONES THAT HAD
NEITHER SHAPE NOR FORM THE CHEEK OF HER BECAUSE HE HAD EYES IN HIS
HEAD TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE FOR HIMSELF
CISSY CAME UP ALONG THE STRAND WITH THE TWO TWINS AND THEIR BALL WITH
HER HAT ANYHOW ON HER TO ONE SIDE AFTER HER RUN AND SHE DID LOOK A
STREEL TUGGING THE TWO KIDS ALONG WITH THE FLIMSY BLOUSE SHE BOUGHT ONLY
A FORTNIGHT BEFORE LIKE A RAG ON HER BACK AND A BIT OF HER PETTICOAT
HANGING LIKE A CARICATURE
GERTY JUST TOOK OFF HER HAT FOR A MOMENT TO
SETTLE HER HAIR AND A PRETTIER A DAINTIER HEAD OF NUTBROWN TRESSES WAS
NEVER SEEN ON A GIRL'S SHOULDERS A RADIANT LITTLE VISION IN SOOTH
ALMOST MADDENING IN ITS SWEETNESS
YOU WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL MANY A LONG
MILE BEFORE YOU FOUND A HEAD OF HAIR THE LIKE OF THAT
SHE COULD ALMOST
SEE THE SWIFT ANSWERING FLASH OF ADMIRATION IN HIS EYES THAT SET HER
TINGLING IN EVERY NERVE
SHE PUT ON HER HAT SO THAT SHE COULD SEE FROM
UNDERNEATH THE BRIM AND SWUNG HER BUCKLED SHOE FASTER FOR HER BREATH
CAUGHT AS SHE CAUGHT THE EXPRESSION IN HIS EYES
HE WAS EYING HER AS A
SNAKE EYES ITS PREY
HER WOMAN'S INSTINCT TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD RAISED
THE DEVIL IN HIM AND AT THE THOUGHT A BURNING SCARLET SWEPT FROM THROAT
TO BROW TILL THE LOVELY COLOUR OF HER FACE BECAME A GLORIOUS ROSE
EDY BOARDMAN WAS NOTICING IT TOO BECAUSE SHE WAS SQUINTING AT GERTY
HALF SMILING WITH HER SPECS LIKE AN OLD MAID PRETENDING TO NURSE THE
BABY
IRRITABLE LITTLE GNAT SHE WAS AND ALWAYS WOULD BE AND THAT WAS WHY
NO ONE COULD GET ON WITH HER POKING HER NOSE INTO WHAT WAS NO CONCERN OF
HERS
AND SHE SAID TO GERTY
A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS
WHAT REPLIED GERTY WITH A SMILE REINFORCED BY THE WHITEST OF TEETH
I
WAS ONLY WONDERING WAS IT LATE
BECAUSE SHE WISHED TO GOODNESS THEY'D TAKE THE SNOTTYNOSED TWINS AND
THEIR BABBY HOME TO THE MISCHIEF OUT OF THAT SO THAT WAS WHY SHE JUST
GAVE A GENTLE HINT ABOUT ITS BEING LATE
AND WHEN CISSY CAME UP EDY
ASKED HER THE TIME AND MISS CISSY AS GLIB AS YOU LIKE SAID IT WAS HALF
PAST KISSING TIME TIME TO KISS AGAIN
BUT EDY WANTED TO KNOW BECAUSE
THEY WERE TOLD TO BE IN EARLY
WAIT SAID CISSY I'LL RUN ASK MY UNCLE PETER OVER THERE WHAT'S THE
TIME BY HIS CONUNDRUM
SO OVER SHE WENT AND WHEN HE SAW HER COMING SHE COULD SEE HIM TAKE HIS
HAND OUT OF HIS POCKET GETTING NERVOUS AND BEGINNING TO PLAY WITH HIS
WATCHCHAIN LOOKING UP AT THE CHURCH
PASSIONATE NATURE THOUGH HE WAS
GERTY COULD SEE THAT HE HAD ENORMOUS CONTROL OVER HIMSELF
ONE MOMENT HE
HAD BEEN THERE FASCINATED BY A LOVELINESS THAT MADE HIM GAZE AND THE
NEXT MOMENT IT WAS THE QUIET GRAVEFACED GENTLEMAN SELFCONTROL EXPRESSED
IN EVERY LINE OF HIS DISTINGUISHEDLOOKING FIGURE
CISSY SAID TO EXCUSE HER WOULD HE MIND PLEASE TELLING HER WHAT WAS THE
RIGHT TIME AND GERTY COULD SEE HIM TAKING OUT HIS WATCH LISTENING TO IT
AND LOOKING UP AND CLEARING HIS THROAT AND HE SAID HE WAS VERY SORRY HIS
WATCH WAS STOPPED BUT HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE AFTER EIGHT BECAUSE THE
SUN WAS SET
HIS VOICE HAD A CULTURED RING IN IT AND THOUGH HE SPOKE IN
MEASURED ACCENTS THERE WAS A SUSPICION OF A QUIVER IN THE MELLOW TONES
CISSY SAID THANKS AND CAME BACK WITH HER TONGUE OUT AND SAID UNCLE SAID
HIS WATERWORKS WERE OUT OF ORDER
THEN THEY SANG THE SECOND VERSE OF THE TANTUM ERGO AND CANON O'HANLON
GOT UP AGAIN AND CENSED THE BLESSED SACRAMENT AND KNELT DOWN AND HE TOLD
FATHER CONROY THAT ONE OF THE CANDLES WAS JUST GOING TO SET FIRE TO THE
FLOWERS AND FATHER CONROY GOT UP AND SETTLED IT ALL RIGHT AND SHE COULD
SEE THE GENTLEMAN WINDING HIS WATCH AND LISTENING TO THE WORKS AND SHE
SWUNG HER LEG MORE IN AND OUT IN TIME
IT WAS GETTING DARKER BUT HE
COULD SEE AND HE WAS LOOKING ALL THE TIME THAT HE WAS WINDING THE WATCH
OR WHATEVER HE WAS DOING TO IT AND THEN HE PUT IT BACK AND PUT HIS HANDS
BACK INTO HIS POCKETS
SHE FELT A KIND OF A SENSATION RUSHING ALL OVER
HER AND SHE KNEW BY THE FEEL OF HER SCALP AND THAT IRRITATION AGAINST
HER STAYS THAT THAT THING MUST BE COMING ON BECAUSE THE LAST TIME TOO
WAS WHEN SHE CLIPPED HER HAIR ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOON
HIS DARK EYES
FIXED THEMSELVES ON HER AGAIN DRINKING IN HER EVERY CONTOUR LITERALLY
WORSHIPPING AT HER SHRINE
IF EVER THERE WAS UNDISGUISED ADMIRATION IN A
MAN'S PASSIONATE GAZE IT WAS THERE PLAIN TO BE SEEN ON THAT MAN'S FACE
IT IS FOR YOU GERTRUDE MACDOWELL AND YOU KNOW IT
EDY BEGAN TO GET READY TO GO AND IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HER AND GERTY
NOTICED THAT THAT LITTLE HINT SHE GAVE HAD HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT
BECAUSE IT WAS A LONG WAY ALONG THE STRAND TO WHERE THERE WAS THE PLACE
TO PUSH UP THE PUSHCAR AND CISSY TOOK OFF THE TWINS' CAPS AND TIDIED
THEIR HAIR TO MAKE HERSELF ATTRACTIVE OF COURSE AND CANON O'HANLON STOOD
UP WITH HIS COPE POKING UP AT HIS NECK AND FATHER CONROY HANDED HIM THE
CARD TO READ OFF AND HE READ OUT PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS AND
EDY AND CISSY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TIME ALL THE TIME AND ASKING HER
BUT GERTY COULD PAY THEM BACK IN THEIR OWN COIN AND SHE JUST ANSWERED
WITH SCATHING POLITENESS WHEN EDY ASKED HER WAS SHE HEARTBROKEN ABOUT
HER BEST BOY THROWING HER OVER
GERTY WINCED SHARPLY
A BRIEF COLD BLAZE
SHONE FROM HER EYES THAT SPOKE VOLUMES OF SCORN IMMEASURABLE
IT HURT O
YES IT CUT DEEP BECAUSE EDY HAD HER OWN QUIET WAY OF SAYING THINGS
LIKE THAT SHE KNEW WOULD WOUND LIKE THE CONFOUNDED LITTLE CAT SHE WAS
GERTY'S LIPS PARTED SWIFTLY TO FRAME THE WORD BUT SHE FOUGHT BACK
THE SOB THAT ROSE TO HER THROAT SO SLIM SO FLAWLESS SO BEAUTIFULLY
MOULDED IT SEEMED ONE AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE DREAMED OF
SHE HAD LOVED HIM
BETTER THAN HE KNEW
LIGHTHEARTED DECEIVER AND FICKLE LIKE ALL HIS SEX
HE WOULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT HE HAD MEANT TO HER AND FOR AN INSTANT
THERE WAS IN THE BLUE EYES A QUICK STINGING OF TEARS
THEIR EYES WERE
PROBING HER MERCILESSLY BUT WITH A BRAVE EFFORT SHE SPARKLED BACK IN
SYMPATHY AS SHE GLANCED AT HER NEW CONQUEST FOR THEM TO SEE
O RESPONDED GERTY QUICK AS LIGHTNING LAUGHING AND THE PROUD HEAD
FLASHED UP
I CAN THROW MY CAP AT WHO I LIKE BECAUSE IT'S LEAP YEAR
HER WORDS RANG OUT CRYSTALCLEAR MORE MUSICAL THAN THE COOING OF THE
RINGDOVE BUT THEY CUT THE SILENCE ICILY
THERE WAS THAT IN HER YOUNG
VOICE THAT TOLD THAT SHE WAS NOT A ONE TO BE LIGHTLY TRIFLED WITH
AS
FOR MR REGGY WITH HIS SWANK AND HIS BIT OF MONEY SHE COULD JUST CHUCK
HIM ASIDE AS IF HE WAS SO MUCH FILTH AND NEVER AGAIN WOULD SHE CAST AS
MUCH AS A SECOND THOUGHT ON HIM AND TEAR HIS SILLY POSTCARD INTO A DOZEN
PIECES
AND IF EVER AFTER HE DARED TO PRESUME SHE COULD GIVE HIM ONE
LOOK OF MEASURED SCORN THAT WOULD MAKE HIM SHRIVEL UP ON THE SPOT
MISS
PUNY LITTLE EDY'S COUNTENANCE FELL TO NO SLIGHT EXTENT AND GERTY COULD
SEE BY HER LOOKING AS BLACK AS THUNDER THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY IN A TOWERING
RAGE THOUGH SHE HID IT THE LITTLE KINNATT BECAUSE THAT SHAFT HAD
STRUCK HOME FOR HER PETTY JEALOUSY AND THEY BOTH KNEW THAT SHE WAS
SOMETHING ALOOF APART IN ANOTHER SPHERE THAT SHE WAS NOT OF THEM AND
NEVER WOULD BE AND THERE WAS SOMEBODY ELSE TOO THAT KNEW IT AND SAW IT
SO THEY COULD PUT THAT IN THEIR PIPE AND SMOKE IT
EDY STRAIGHTENED UP BABY BOARDMAN TO GET READY TO GO AND CISSY TUCKED IN
THE BALL AND THE SPADES AND BUCKETS AND IT WAS HIGH TIME TOO BECAUSE THE
SANDMAN WAS ON HIS WAY FOR MASTER BOARDMAN JUNIOR
AND CISSY TOLD HIM
TOO THAT BILLY WINKS WAS COMING AND THAT BABY WAS TO GO DEEDAW AND BABY
LOOKED JUST TOO DUCKY LAUGHING UP OUT OF HIS GLEEFUL EYES AND CISSY
POKED HIM LIKE THAT OUT OF FUN IN HIS WEE FAT TUMMY AND BABY WITHOUT AS
MUCH AS BY YOUR LEAVE SENT UP HIS COMPLIMENTS TO ALL AND SUNDRY ON TO
HIS BRANDNEW DRIBBLING BIB
O MY PUDDENY PIE PROTESTED CISS
HE HAS HIS BIB DESTROYED
THE SLIGHT CONTRETEMPS CLAIMED HER ATTENTION BUT IN TWO TWOS SHE SET
THAT LITTLE MATTER TO RIGHTS
GERTY STIFLED A SMOTHERED EXCLAMATION AND GAVE A NERVOUS COUGH AND EDY
ASKED WHAT AND SHE WAS JUST GOING TO TELL HER TO CATCH IT WHILE IT WAS
FLYING BUT SHE WAS EVER LADYLIKE IN HER DEPORTMENT SO SHE SIMPLY PASSED
IT OFF WITH CONSUMMATE TACT BY SAYING THAT THAT WAS THE BENEDICTION
BECAUSE JUST THEN THE BELL RANG OUT FROM THE STEEPLE OVER THE QUIET
SEASHORE BECAUSE CANON O'HANLON WAS UP ON THE ALTAR WITH THE VEIL THAT
FATHER CONROY PUT ROUND HIS SHOULDERS GIVING THE BENEDICTION WITH THE
BLESSED SACRAMENT IN HIS HANDS
HOW MOVING THE SCENE THERE IN THE GATHERING TWILIGHT THE LAST GLIMPSE
OF ERIN THE TOUCHING CHIME OF THOSE EVENING BELLS AND AT THE SAME
TIME A BAT FLEW FORTH FROM THE IVIED BELFRY THROUGH THE DUSK HITHER
THITHER WITH A TINY LOST CRY
AND SHE COULD SEE FAR AWAY THE LIGHTS OF
THE LIGHTHOUSES SO PICTURESQUE SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO DO WITH A BOX OF
PAINTS BECAUSE IT WAS EASIER THAN TO MAKE A MAN AND SOON THE LAMPLIGHTER
WOULD BE GOING HIS ROUNDS PAST THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH GROUNDS AND ALONG
BY SHADY TRITONVILLE AVENUE WHERE THE COUPLES WALKED AND LIGHTING THE
LAMP NEAR HER WINDOW WHERE REGGY WYLIE USED TO TURN HIS FREEWHEEL LIKE
SHE READ IN THAT BOOK THE LAMPLIGHTER BY MISS CUMMINS AUTHOR OF
MABEL VAUGHAN AND OTHER TALES
FOR GERTY HAD HER DREAMS THAT NO ONE
KNEW OF
SHE LOVED TO READ POETRY AND WHEN SHE GOT A KEEPSAKE FROM
BERTHA SUPPLE OF THAT LOVELY CONFESSION ALBUM WITH THE CORALPINK COVER
TO WRITE HER THOUGHTS IN SHE LAID IT IN THE DRAWER OF HER TOILETTABLE
WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT ERR ON THE SIDE OF LUXURY WAS SCRUPULOUSLY
NEAT AND CLEAN
IT WAS THERE SHE KEPT HER GIRLISH TREASURE TROVE THE
TORTOISESHELL COMBS HER CHILD OF MARY BADGE THE WHITEROSE SCENT THE
EYEBROWLEINE HER ALABASTER POUNCETBOX AND THE RIBBONS TO CHANGE
WHEN HER THINGS CAME HOME FROM THE WASH AND THERE WERE SOME BEAUTIFUL
THOUGHTS WRITTEN IN IT IN VIOLET INK THAT SHE BOUGHT IN HELY'S OF DAME
STREET FOR SHE FELT THAT SHE TOO COULD WRITE POETRY IF SHE COULD ONLY
EXPRESS HERSELF LIKE THAT POEM THAT APPEALED TO HER SO DEEPLY THAT
SHE HAD COPIED OUT OF THE NEWSPAPER SHE FOUND ONE EVENING ROUND THE
POTHERBS
ART THOU REAL MY IDEAL IT WAS CALLED BY LOUIS J WALSH
MAGHERAFELT AND AFTER THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT TWILIGHT WILT THOU
EVER AND OFTTIMES THE BEAUTY OF POETRY SO SAD IN ITS TRANSIENT
LOVELINESS HAD MISTED HER EYES WITH SILENT TEARS FOR SHE FELT THAT
THE YEARS WERE SLIPPING BY FOR HER ONE BY ONE AND BUT FOR THAT ONE
SHORTCOMING SHE KNEW SHE NEED FEAR NO COMPETITION AND THAT WAS AN
ACCIDENT COMING DOWN DALKEY HILL AND SHE ALWAYS TRIED TO CONCEAL IT
BUT IT MUST END SHE FELT
IF SHE SAW THAT MAGIC LURE IN HIS EYES THERE
WOULD BE NO HOLDING BACK FOR HER
LOVE LAUGHS AT LOCKSMITHS
SHE
WOULD MAKE THE GREAT SACRIFICE
HER EVERY EFFORT WOULD BE TO SHARE HIS
THOUGHTS
DEARER THAN THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD SHE BE TO HIM AND GILD HIS
DAYS WITH HAPPINESS
THERE WAS THE ALLIMPORTANT QUESTION AND SHE WAS
DYING TO KNOW WAS HE A MARRIED MAN OR A WIDOWER WHO HAD LOST HIS WIFE
OR SOME TRAGEDY LIKE THE NOBLEMAN WITH THE FOREIGN NAME FROM THE LAND
OF SONG HAD TO HAVE HER PUT INTO A MADHOUSE CRUEL ONLY TO BE KIND
BUT EVEN IF WHAT THEN WOULD IT MAKE A VERY GREAT DIFFERENCE FROM
EVERYTHING IN THE LEAST INDELICATE HER FINEBRED NATURE INSTINCTIVELY
RECOILED
SHE LOATHED THAT SORT OF PERSON THE FALLEN WOMEN OFF THE
ACCOMMODATION WALK BESIDE THE DODDER THAT WENT WITH THE SOLDIERS AND
COARSE MEN WITH NO RESPECT FOR A GIRL'S HONOUR DEGRADING THE SEX AND
BEING TAKEN UP TO THE POLICE STATION
NO NO NOT THAT
THEY WOULD BE
JUST GOOD FRIENDS LIKE A BIG BROTHER AND SISTER WITHOUT ALL THAT OTHER
IN SPITE OF THE CONVENTIONS OF SOCIETY WITH A BIG ESS
PERHAPS IT WAS
AN OLD FLAME HE WAS IN MOURNING FOR FROM THE DAYS BEYOND RECALL
SHE
THOUGHT SHE UNDERSTOOD
SHE WOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND HIM BECAUSE MEN WERE
SO DIFFERENT
THE OLD LOVE WAS WAITING WAITING WITH LITTLE WHITE
HANDS STRETCHED OUT WITH BLUE APPEALING EYES
HEART OF MINE SHE WOULD
FOLLOW HER DREAM OF LOVE THE DICTATES OF HER HEART THAT TOLD HER HE
WAS HER ALL IN ALL THE ONLY MAN IN ALL THE WORLD FOR HER FOR LOVE WAS
THE MASTER GUIDE
NOTHING ELSE MATTERED
COME WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD BE
WILD UNTRAMMELLED FREE
CANON O'HANLON PUT THE BLESSED SACRAMENT BACK INTO THE TABERNACLE AND
GENUFLECTED AND THE CHOIR SANG LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES AND THEN
HE LOCKED THE TABERNACLE DOOR BECAUSE THE BENEDICTION WAS OVER AND
FATHER CONROY HANDED HIM HIS HAT TO PUT ON AND CROSSCAT EDY ASKED WASN'T
SHE COMING BUT JACKY CAFFREY CALLED OUT
O LOOK CISSY
AND THEY ALL LOOKED WAS IT SHEET LIGHTNING BUT TOMMY SAW IT TOO OVER THE
TREES BESIDE THE CHURCH BLUE AND THEN GREEN AND PURPLE
IT'S FIREWORKS CISSY CAFFREY SAID
AND THEY ALL RAN DOWN THE STRAND TO SEE OVER THE HOUSES AND THE CHURCH
HELTERSKELTER EDY WITH THE PUSHCAR WITH BABY BOARDMAN IN IT AND CISSY
HOLDING TOMMY AND JACKY BY THE HAND SO THEY WOULDN'T FALL RUNNING
COME ON GERTY CISSY CALLED
IT'S THE BAZAAR FIREWORKS
BUT GERTY WAS ADAMANT
SHE HAD NO INTENTION OF BEING AT THEIR BECK AND
CALL
IF THEY COULD RUN LIKE ROSSIES SHE COULD SIT SO SHE SAID SHE COULD
SEE FROM WHERE SHE WAS
THE EYES THAT WERE FASTENED UPON HER SET HER
PULSES TINGLING
SHE LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT MEETING HIS GLANCE AND
A LIGHT BROKE IN UPON HER
WHITEHOT PASSION WAS IN THAT FACE PASSION
SILENT AS THE GRAVE AND IT HAD MADE HER HIS
AT LAST THEY WERE LEFT
ALONE WITHOUT THE OTHERS TO PRY AND PASS REMARKS AND SHE KNEW HE COULD
BE TRUSTED TO THE DEATH STEADFAST A STERLING MAN A MAN OF INFLEXIBLE
HONOUR TO HIS FINGERTIPS
HIS HANDS AND FACE WERE WORKING AND A TREMOUR
WENT OVER HER
SHE LEANED BACK FAR TO LOOK UP WHERE THE FIREWORKS WERE
AND SHE CAUGHT HER KNEE IN HER HANDS SO AS NOT TO FALL BACK LOOKING UP
AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE ONLY HIM AND HER WHEN SHE REVEALED ALL HER
GRACEFUL BEAUTIFULLY SHAPED LEGS LIKE THAT SUPPLY SOFT AND DELICATELY
ROUNDED AND SHE SEEMED TO HEAR THE PANTING OF HIS HEART HIS HOARSE
BREATHING BECAUSE SHE KNEW TOO ABOUT THE PASSION OF MEN LIKE THAT
HOTBLOODED BECAUSE BERTHA SUPPLE TOLD HER ONCE IN DEAD SECRET AND MADE
HER SWEAR SHE'D NEVER ABOUT THE GENTLEMAN LODGER THAT WAS STAYING WITH
THEM OUT OF THE CONGESTED DISTRICTS BOARD THAT HAD PICTURES CUT OUT OF
PAPERS OF THOSE SKIRTDANCERS AND HIGHKICKERS AND SHE SAID HE USED TO DO
SOMETHING NOT VERY NICE THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE SOMETIMES IN THE BED
BUT
THIS WAS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT FROM A THING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS
ALL THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE SHE COULD ALMOST FEEL HIM DRAW HER FACE TO
HIS AND THE FIRST QUICK HOT TOUCH OF HIS HANDSOME LIPS
BESIDES THERE
WAS ABSOLUTION SO LONG AS YOU DIDN'T DO THE OTHER THING BEFORE BEING
MARRIED AND THERE OUGHT TO BE WOMEN PRIESTS THAT WOULD UNDERSTAND
WITHOUT YOUR TELLING OUT AND CISSY CAFFREY TOO SOMETIMES HAD THAT DREAMY
KIND OF DREAMY LOOK IN HER EYES SO THAT SHE TOO MY DEAR AND WINNY
RIPPINGHAM SO MAD ABOUT ACTORS' PHOTOGRAPHS AND BESIDES IT WAS ON
ACCOUNT OF THAT OTHER THING COMING ON THE WAY IT DID
AND JACKY CAFFREY SHOUTED TO LOOK THERE WAS ANOTHER AND SHE LEANED BACK
AND THE GARTERS WERE BLUE TO MATCH ON ACCOUNT OF THE TRANSPARENT AND
THEY ALL SAW IT AND THEY ALL SHOUTED TO LOOK LOOK THERE IT WAS AND
SHE LEANED BACK EVER SO FAR TO SEE THE FIREWORKS AND SOMETHING QUEER WAS
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR A SOFT THING TO AND FRO DARK
AND SHE SAW A
LONG ROMAN CANDLE GOING UP OVER THE TREES UP UP AND IN THE TENSE
HUSH THEY WERE ALL BREATHLESS WITH EXCITEMENT AS IT WENT HIGHER AND
HIGHER AND SHE HAD TO LEAN BACK MORE AND MORE TO LOOK UP AFTER IT HIGH
HIGH ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT AND HER FACE WAS SUFFUSED WITH A DIVINE AN
ENTRANCING BLUSH FROM STRAINING BACK AND HE COULD SEE HER OTHER THINGS
TOO NAINSOOK KNICKERS THE FABRIC THAT CARESSES THE SKIN BETTER THAN
THOSE OTHER PETTIWIDTH THE GREEN FOUR AND ELEVEN ON ACCOUNT OF BEING
WHITE AND SHE LET HIM AND SHE SAW THAT HE SAW AND THEN IT WENT SO HIGH
IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT A MOMENT AND SHE WAS TREMBLING IN EVERY LIMB FROM
BEING BENT SO FAR BACK THAT HE HAD A FULL VIEW HIGH UP ABOVE HER KNEE
WHERE NO ONE EVER NOT EVEN ON THE SWING OR WADING AND SHE WASN'T ASHAMED
AND HE WASN'T EITHER TO LOOK IN THAT IMMODEST WAY LIKE THAT BECAUSE HE
COULDN'T RESIST THE SIGHT OF THE WONDROUS REVEALMENT HALF OFFERED LIKE
THOSE SKIRTDANCERS BEHAVING SO IMMODEST BEFORE GENTLEMEN LOOKING AND HE
KEPT ON LOOKING LOOKING
SHE WOULD FAIN HAVE CRIED TO HIM CHOKINGLY
HELD OUT HER SNOWY SLENDER ARMS TO HIM TO COME TO FEEL HIS LIPS LAID ON
HER WHITE BROW THE CRY OF A YOUNG GIRL'S LOVE A LITTLE STRANGLED CRY
WRUNG FROM HER THAT CRY THAT HAS RUNG THROUGH THE AGES
AND THEN A
ROCKET SPRANG AND BANG SHOT BLIND BLANK AND O THEN THE ROMAN CANDLE
BURST AND IT WAS LIKE A SIGH OF O AND EVERYONE CRIED O O IN RAPTURES
AND IT GUSHED OUT OF IT A STREAM OF RAIN GOLD HAIR THREADS AND THEY
SHED AND AH THEY WERE ALL GREENY DEWY STARS FALLING WITH GOLDEN O SO
LOVELY O SOFT SWEET SOFT
THEN ALL MELTED AWAY DEWILY IN THE GREY AIR ALL WAS SILENT
AH SHE
GLANCED AT HIM AS SHE BENT FORWARD QUICKLY A PATHETIC LITTLE GLANCE OF
PITEOUS PROTEST OF SHY REPROACH UNDER WHICH HE COLOURED LIKE A GIRL HE
WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE ROCK BEHIND
LEOPOLD BLOOM FOR IT IS HE
STANDS SILENT WITH BOWED HEAD BEFORE THOSE YOUNG GUILELESS EYES
WHAT A
BRUTE HE HAD BEEN AT IT AGAIN A FAIR UNSULLIED SOUL HAD CALLED TO HIM
AND WRETCH THAT HE WAS HOW HAD HE ANSWERED AN UTTER CAD HE HAD BEEN
HE OF ALL MEN BUT THERE WAS AN INFINITE STORE OF MERCY IN THOSE EYES
FOR HIM TOO A WORD OF PARDON EVEN THOUGH HE HAD ERRED AND SINNED AND
WANDERED
SHOULD A GIRL TELL NO A THOUSAND TIMES NO
THAT WAS THEIR
SECRET ONLY THEIRS ALONE IN THE HIDING TWILIGHT AND THERE WAS NONE TO
KNOW OR TELL SAVE THE LITTLE BAT THAT FLEW SO SOFTLY THROUGH THE EVENING
TO AND FRO AND LITTLE BATS DON'T TELL
CISSY CAFFREY WHISTLED IMITATING THE BOYS IN THE FOOTBALL FIELD TO SHOW
WHAT A GREAT PERSON SHE WAS AND THEN SHE CRIED
GERTY GERTY WE'RE GOING
COME ON
WE CAN SEE FROM FARTHER UP
GERTY HAD AN IDEA ONE OF LOVE'S LITTLE RUSES
SHE SLIPPED A HAND INTO
HER KERCHIEF POCKET AND TOOK OUT THE WADDING AND WAVED IN REPLY OF
COURSE WITHOUT LETTING HIM AND THEN SLIPPED IT BACK
WONDER IF HE'S TOO
FAR TO
SHE ROSE
WAS IT GOODBYE NO
SHE HAD TO GO BUT THEY WOULD MEET
AGAIN THERE AND SHE WOULD DREAM OF THAT TILL THEN TOMORROW OF HER
DREAM OF YESTER EVE
SHE DREW HERSELF UP TO HER FULL HEIGHT
THEIR SOULS
MET IN A LAST LINGERING GLANCE AND THE EYES THAT REACHED HER HEART FULL
OF A STRANGE SHINING HUNG ENRAPTURED ON HER SWEET FLOWERLIKE FACE
SHE
HALF SMILED AT HIM WANLY A SWEET FORGIVING SMILE A SMILE THAT VERGED
ON TEARS AND THEN THEY PARTED
SLOWLY WITHOUT LOOKING BACK SHE WENT DOWN THE UNEVEN STRAND TO CISSY
TO EDY TO JACKY AND TOMMY CAFFREY TO LITTLE BABY BOARDMAN
IT WAS
DARKER NOW AND THERE WERE STONES AND BITS OF WOOD ON THE STRAND AND
SLIPPY SEAWEED
SHE WALKED WITH A CERTAIN QUIET DIGNITY CHARACTERISTIC
OF HER BUT WITH CARE AND VERY SLOWLY BECAUSE BECAUSE GERTY MACDOWELL
WAS
TIGHT BOOTS NO
SHE'S LAME O
MR BLOOM WATCHED HER AS SHE LIMPED AWAY
POOR GIRL THAT'S WHY SHE'S
LEFT ON THE SHELF AND THE OTHERS DID A SPRINT
THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS

EVERY BULLET HAS ITS BILLET

ANYTHING STRAIGHT AT SCHOOL

STILL THERE'S DESTINY IN IT FALLING
IN LOVE
HAVE THEIR OWN SECRETS BETWEEN THEM
CHAPS THAT WOULD GO TO THE
DOGS IF SOME WOMAN DIDN'T TAKE THEM IN HAND

UNIVERSALLY THAT PERSON'S ACUMEN IS ESTEEMED VERY LITTLE PERCEPTIVE
CONCERNING WHATSOEVER MATTERS ARE BEING HELD AS MOST PROFITABLY BY
MORTALS WITH SAPIENCE ENDOWED TO BE STUDIED WHO IS IGNORANT OF THAT
WHICH THE MOST IN DOCTRINE ERUDITE AND CERTAINLY BY REASON OF THAT IN
THEM HIGH MIND'S ORNAMENT DESERVING OF VENERATION CONSTANTLY MAINTAIN
WHEN BY GENERAL CONSENT THEY AFFIRM THAT OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEING
EQUAL BY NO EXTERIOR SPLENDOUR IS THE PROSPERITY OF A NATION MORE
EFFICACIOUSLY ASSERTED THAN BY THE MEASURE OF HOW FAR FORWARD MAY
HAVE PROGRESSED THE TRIBUTE OF ITS SOLICITUDE FOR THAT PROLIFERENT
CONTINUANCE WHICH OF EVILS THE ORIGINAL IF IT BE ABSENT WHEN FORTUNATELY
PRESENT CONSTITUTES THE CERTAIN SIGN OF OMNIPOTENT NATURE'S INCORRUPTED
BENEFACTION
FOR WHO IS THERE WHO ANYTHING OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE HAS
APPREHENDED BUT IS CONSCIOUS THAT THAT EXTERIOR SPLENDOUR MAY BE THE
SURFACE OF A DOWNWARDTENDING LUTULENT REALITY OR ON THE CONTRARY ANYONE
SO IS THERE UNILLUMINATED AS NOT TO PERCEIVE THAT AS NO NATURE'S BOON
CAN CONTEND AGAINST THE BOUNTY OF INCREASE SO IT BEHOVES EVERY MOST JUST
CITIZEN TO BECOME THE EXHORTATOR AND ADMONISHER OF HIS SEMBLABLES AND
TO TREMBLE LEST WHAT HAD IN THE PAST BEEN BY THE NATION EXCELLENTLY
COMMENCED MIGHT BE IN THE FUTURE NOT WITH SIMILAR EXCELLENCE
ACCOMPLISHED IF AN INVERECUND HABIT SHALL HAVE GRADUALLY TRADUCED
THE HONOURABLE BY ANCESTORS TRANSMITTED CUSTOMS TO THAT THITHER OF
PROFUNDITY THAT THAT ONE WAS AUDACIOUS EXCESSIVELY WHO WOULD HAVE THE
HARDIHOOD TO RISE AFFIRMING THAT NO MORE ODIOUS OFFENCE CAN FOR ANYONE
BE THAN TO OBLIVIOUS NEGLECT TO CONSIGN THAT EVANGEL SIMULTANEOUSLY
COMMAND AND PROMISE WHICH ON ALL MORTALS WITH PROPHECY OF ABUNDANCE
OR WITH DIMINUTION'S MENACE THAT EXALTED OF REITERATEDLY PROCREATING
FUNCTION EVER IRREVOCABLY ENJOINED
IT IS NOT WHY THEREFORE WE SHALL WONDER IF AS THE BEST HISTORIANS
RELATE AMONG THE CELTS WHO NOTHING THAT WAS NOT IN ITS NATURE
ADMIRABLE ADMIRED THE ART OF MEDICINE SHALL HAVE BEEN HIGHLY HONOURED
NOT TO SPEAK OF HOSTELS LEPERYARDS SWEATING CHAMBERS PLAGUEGRAVES
THEIR GREATEST DOCTORS THE O'SHIELS THE O'HICKEYS THE O'LEES
HAVE SEDULOUSLY SET DOWN THE DIVERS METHODS BY WHICH THE SICK AND THE
RELAPSED FOUND AGAIN HEALTH WHETHER THE MALADY HAD BEEN THE TREMBLING
WITHERING OR LOOSE BOYCONNELL FLUX
CERTAINLY IN EVERY PUBLIC WORK WHICH
IN IT ANYTHING OF GRAVITY CONTAINS PREPARATION SHOULD BE WITH IMPORTANCE
COMMENSURATE AND THEREFORE A PLAN WAS BY THEM ADOPTED WHETHER BY HAVING
PRECONSIDERED OR AS THE MATURATION OF EXPERIENCE IT IS DIFFICULT IN
BEING SAID WHICH THE DISCREPANT OPINIONS OF SUBSEQUENT INQUIRERS ARE NOT
UP TO THE PRESENT CONGRUED TO RENDER MANIFEST WHEREBY MATERNITY WAS SO
FAR FROM ALL ACCIDENT POSSIBILITY REMOVED THAT WHATEVER CARE THE PATIENT
IN THAT ALL HARDEST OF WOMAN HOUR CHIEFLY REQUIRED AND NOT SOLELY
FOR THE COPIOUSLY OPULENT BUT ALSO FOR HER WHO NOT BEING SUFFICIENTLY
MONEYED SCARCELY AND OFTEN NOT EVEN SCARCELY COULD SUBSIST VALIANTLY AND
FOR AN INCONSIDERABLE EMOLUMENT WAS PROVIDED
TO HER NOTHING ALREADY THEN AND THENCEFORWARD WAS ANYWAY ABLE TO BE
MOLESTFUL FOR THIS CHIEFLY FELT ALL CITIZENS EXCEPT WITH PROLIFERENT
MOTHERS PROSPERITY AT ALL NOT TO CAN BE AND AS THEY HAD RECEIVED
ETERNITY GODS MORTALS GENERATION TO BEFIT THEM HER BEHOLDING WHEN THE
CASE WAS SO HOVING ITSELF PARTURIENT IN VEHICLE THEREWARD CARRYING
DESIRE IMMENSE AMONG ALL ONE ANOTHER WAS IMPELLING ON OF HER TO BE
RECEIVED INTO THAT DOMICILE
O THING OF PRUDENT NATION NOT MERELY IN
BEING SEEN BUT ALSO EVEN IN BEING RELATED WORTHY OF BEING PRAISED THAT
THEY HER BY ANTICIPATION WENT SEEING MOTHER THAT SHE BY THEM SUDDENLY
TO BE ABOUT TO BE CHERISHED HAD BEEN BEGUN SHE FELT
BEFORE BORN BLISS BABE HAD
WITHIN WOMB WON HE WORSHIP
WHATEVER IN THAT
ONE CASE DONE COMMODIOUSLY DONE WAS
A COUCH BY MIDWIVES ATTENDED WITH
WHOLESOME FOOD REPOSEFUL CLEANEST SWADDLES AS THOUGH FORTHBRINGING WERE
NOW DONE AND BY WISE FORESIGHT SET BUT TO THIS NO LESS OF WHAT DRUGS
THERE IS NEED AND SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS WHICH ARE PERTAINING TO HER
CASE NOT OMITTING ASPECT OF ALL VERY DISTRACTING SPECTACLES IN VARIOUS
LATITUDES BY OUR TERRESTRIAL ORB OFFERED TOGETHER WITH IMAGES DIVINE
AND HUMAN THE COGITATION OF WHICH BY SEJUNCT FEMALES IS TO TUMESCENCE

NINE
TWELVE BLOODFLOWS CHIDING HER CHILDLESS
AND WHILES THEY SPAKE THE DOOR OF THE CASTLE WAS OPENED AND THERE NIGHED
THEM A MICKLE NOISE AS OF MANY THAT SAT THERE AT MEAT
AND THERE CAME
AGAINST THE PLACE AS THEY STOOD A YOUNG LEARNINGKNIGHT YCLEPT DIXON
AND
THE TRAVELLER LEOPOLD WAS COUTH TO HIM SITHEN IT HAD HAPPED THAT THEY
HAD HAD ADO EACH WITH OTHER IN THE HOUSE OF MISERICORD WHERE THIS
LEARNINGKNIGHT LAY BY CAUSE THE TRAVELLER LEOPOLD CAME THERE TO BE
HEALED FOR HE WAS SORE WOUNDED IN HIS BREAST BY A SPEAR WHEREWITH A
HORRIBLE AND DREADFUL DRAGON WAS SMITTEN HIM FOR WHICH HE DID DO MAKE
A SALVE OF VOLATILE SALT AND CHRISM AS MUCH AS HE MIGHT SUFFICE
AND HE
SAID NOW THAT HE SHOULD GO IN TO THAT CASTLE FOR TO MAKE MERRY WITH
THEM THAT WERE THERE
AND THE TRAVELLER LEOPOLD SAID THAT HE SHOULD GO
OTHERWHITHER FOR HE WAS A MAN OF CAUTELS AND A SUBTILE
ALSO THE LADY
WAS OF HIS AVIS AND REPREVED THE LEARNINGKNIGHT THOUGH SHE TROWED WELL
THAT THE TRAVELLER HAD SAID THING THAT WAS FALSE FOR HIS SUBTILITY
BUT
THE LEARNINGKNIGHT WOULD NOT HEAR SAY NAY NOR DO HER MANDEMENT NE HAVE
HIM IN AUGHT CONTRARIOUS TO HIS LIST AND HE SAID HOW IT WAS A MARVELLOUS
CASTLE
AND THE TRAVELLER LEOPOLD WENT INTO THE CASTLE FOR TO REST HIM
FOR A SPACE BEING SORE OF LIMB AFTER MANY MARCHES ENVIRONING IN DIVERS
LANDS AND SOMETIME VENERY
AND IN THE CASTLE WAS SET A BOARD THAT WAS OF THE BIRCHWOOD OF FINLANDY
AND IT WAS UPHELD BY FOUR DWARFMEN OF THAT COUNTRY BUT THEY DURST NOT
MOVE MORE FOR ENCHANTMENT
AND ON THIS BOARD WERE FRIGHTFUL SWORDS AND
KNIVES THAT ARE MADE IN A GREAT CAVERN BY SWINKING DEMONS OUT OF WHITE
FLAMES THAT THEY FIX THEN IN THE HORNS OF BUFFALOS AND STAGS THAT THERE
ABOUND MARVELLOUSLY
AND THERE WERE VESSELS THAT ARE WROUGHT BY MAGIC OF
MAHOUND OUT OF SEASAND AND THE AIR BY A WARLOCK WITH HIS BREATH THAT HE
BLASES IN TO THEM LIKE TO BUBBLES
AND FULL FAIR CHEER AND RICH WAS ON
THE BOARD THAT NO WIGHT COULD DEVISE A FULLER NE RICHER
AND THERE WAS
A VAT OF SILVER THAT WAS MOVED BY CRAFT TO OPEN IN THE WHICH LAY STRANGE
FISHES WITHOUTEN HEADS THOUGH MISBELIEVING MEN NIE THAT THIS BE POSSIBLE
THING WITHOUT THEY SEE IT NATHELESS THEY ARE SO
AND THESE FISHES LIE
IN AN OILY WATER BROUGHT THERE FROM PORTUGAL LAND BECAUSE OF THE FATNESS
THAT THEREIN IS LIKE TO THE JUICES OF THE OLIVEPRESS
AND ALSO IT WAS
A MARVEL TO SEE IN THAT CASTLE HOW BY MAGIC THEY MAKE A COMPOST OUT OF
FECUND WHEATKIDNEYS OUT OF CHALDEE THAT BY AID OF CERTAIN ANGRY SPIRITS
THAT THEY DO IN TO IT SWELLS UP WONDROUSLY LIKE TO A VAST MOUNTAIN
AND
THEY TEACH THE SERPENTS THERE TO ENTWINE THEMSELVES UP ON LONG STICKS
OUT OF THE GROUND AND OF THE SCALES OF THESE SERPENTS THEY BREW OUT A
BREWAGE LIKE TO MEAD
AND THE LEARNING KNIGHT LET POUR FOR CHILDE LEOPOLD A DRAUGHT AND HALP
THERETO THE WHILE ALL THEY THAT WERE THERE DRANK EVERY EACH
AND CHILDE
LEOPOLD DID UP HIS BEAVER FOR TO PLEASURE HIM AND TOOK APERTLY SOMEWHAT
IN AMITY FOR HE NEVER DRANK NO MANNER OF MEAD WHICH HE THEN PUT BY AND
ANON FULL PRIVILY HE VOIDED THE MORE PART IN HIS NEIGHBOUR GLASS AND
HIS NEIGHBOUR NIST NOT OF THIS WILE
AND HE SAT DOWN IN THAT CASTLE WITH
THEM FOR TO REST HIM THERE AWHILE
THANKED BE ALMIGHTY GOD
THIS MEANWHILE THIS GOOD SISTER STOOD BY THE DOOR AND BEGGED THEM AT THE
REVERENCE OF JESU OUR ALTHER LIEGE LORD TO LEAVE THEIR WASSAILING FOR
THERE WAS ABOVE ONE QUICK WITH CHILD A GENTLE DAME WHOSE TIME HIED
FAST
SIR LEOPOLD HEARD ON THE UPFLOOR CRY ON HIGH AND HE WONDERED WHAT
CRY THAT IT WAS WHETHER OF CHILD OR WOMAN AND I MARVEL SAID HE THAT IT
BE NOT COME OR NOW
MESEEMS IT DURETH OVERLONG
AND HE WAS WARE AND SAW
A FRANKLIN THAT HIGHT LENEHAN ON THAT SIDE THE TABLE THAT WAS OLDER THAN
ANY OF THE TOTHER AND FOR THAT THEY BOTH WERE KNIGHTS VIRTUOUS IN THE
ONE EMPRISE AND EKE BY CAUSE THAT HE WAS ELDER HE SPOKE TO HIM FULL
GENTLY
BUT SAID HE OR IT BE LONG TOO SHE WILL BRING FORTH BY GOD HIS
BOUNTY AND HAVE JOY OF HER CHILDING FOR SHE HATH WAITED MARVELLOUS LONG
AND THE FRANKLIN THAT HAD DRUNKEN SAID EXPECTING EACH MOMENT TO BE HER
NEXT
ALSO HE TOOK THE CUP THAT STOOD TOFORE HIM FOR HIM NEEDED NEVER
NONE ASKING NOR DESIRING OF HIM TO DRINK AND NOW DRINK SAID HE FULLY
DELECTABLY AND HE QUAFFED AS FAR AS HE MIGHT TO THEIR BOTH'S HEALTH FOR
HE WAS A PASSING GOOD MAN OF HIS LUSTINESS
AND SIR LEOPOLD THAT WAS THE
GOODLIEST GUEST THAT EVER SAT IN SCHOLARS' HALL AND THAT WAS THE MEEKEST
MAN AND THE KINDEST THAT EVER LAID HUSBANDLY HAND UNDER HEN AND THAT WAS
THE VERY TRUEST KNIGHT OF THE WORLD ONE THAT EVER DID MINION SERVICE
TO LADY GENTLE PLEDGED HIM COURTLY IN THE CUP
WOMAN'S WOE WITH WONDER
PONDERING
NOW LET US SPEAK OF THAT FELLOWSHIP THAT WAS THERE TO THE INTENT TO BE
DRUNKEN AN THEY MIGHT
THERE WAS A SORT OF SCHOLARS ALONG EITHER SIDE
THE BOARD THAT IS TO WIT DIXON YCLEPT JUNIOR OF SAINT MARY MERCIABLE'S
WITH OTHER HIS FELLOWS LYNCH AND MADDEN SCHOLARS OF MEDICINE AND THE
FRANKLIN THAT HIGHT LENEHAN AND ONE FROM ALBA LONGA ONE CROTTHERS AND
YOUNG STEPHEN THAT HAD MIEN OF A FRERE THAT WAS AT HEAD OF THE BOARD
AND COSTELLO THAT MEN CLEPEN PUNCH COSTELLO ALL LONG OF A MASTERY OF
HIM EREWHILE GESTED AND OF ALL THEM RESERVED YOUNG STEPHEN HE WAS THE
MOST DRUNKEN THAT DEMANDED STILL OF MORE MEAD AND BESIDE THE MEEK SIR
LEOPOLD
BUT ON YOUNG MALACHI THEY WAITED FOR THAT HE PROMISED TO HAVE
COME AND SUCH AS INTENDED TO NO GOODNESS SAID HOW HE HAD BROKE HIS AVOW
AND SIR LEOPOLD SAT WITH THEM FOR HE BORE FAST FRIENDSHIP TO SIR SIMON
AND TO THIS HIS SON YOUNG STEPHEN AND FOR THAT HIS LANGUOR BECALMED HIM
THERE AFTER LONGEST WANDERINGS INSOMUCH AS THEY FEASTED HIM FOR THAT
TIME IN THE HONOURABLEST MANNER
RUTH RED HIM LOVE LED ON WITH WILL TO
WANDER LOTH TO LEAVE
FOR THEY WERE RIGHT WITTY SCHOLARS
AND HE HEARD THEIR ARESOUNS EACH GEN
OTHER AS TOUCHING BIRTH AND RIGHTEOUSNESS YOUNG MADDEN MAINTAINING THAT
PUT SUCH CASE IT WERE HARD THE WIFE TO DIE FOR SO IT HAD FALLEN OUT A
MATTER OF SOME YEAR AGONE WITH A WOMAN OF EBLANA IN HORNE'S HOUSE THAT
NOW WAS TRESPASSED OUT OF THIS WORLD AND THE SELF NIGHT NEXT BEFORE HER
DEATH ALL LEECHES AND POTHECARIES HAD TAKEN COUNSEL OF HER CASE
AND
THEY SAID FARTHER SHE SHOULD LIVE BECAUSE IN THE BEGINNING THEY SAID
THE WOMAN SHOULD BRING FORTH IN PAIN AND WHEREFORE THEY THAT WERE OF
THIS IMAGINATION AFFIRMED HOW YOUNG MADDEN HAD SAID TRUTH FOR HE HAD
CONSCIENCE TO LET HER DIE
AND NOT FEW AND OF THESE WAS YOUNG LYNCH
WERE IN DOUBT THAT THE WORLD WAS NOW RIGHT EVIL GOVERNED AS IT WAS NEVER
OTHER HOWBEIT THE MEAN PEOPLE BELIEVED IT OTHERWISE BUT THE LAW NOR HIS
JUDGES DID PROVIDE NO REMEDY
A REDRESS GOD GRANT
THIS WAS SCANT SAID
BUT ALL CRIED WITH ONE ACCLAIM NAY BY OUR VIRGIN MOTHER THE WIFE
SHOULD LIVE AND THE BABE TO DIE
IN COLOUR WHEREOF THEY WAXED HOT
UPON THAT HEAD WHAT WITH ARGUMENT AND WHAT FOR THEIR DRINKING BUT THE
FRANKLIN LENEHAN WAS PROMPT EACH WHEN TO POUR THEM ALE SO THAT AT THE
LEAST WAY MIRTH MIGHT NOT LACK
THEN YOUNG MADDEN SHOWED ALL THE WHOLE
AFFAIR AND SAID HOW THAT SHE WAS DEAD AND HOW FOR HOLY RELIGION SAKE BY
REDE OF PALMER AND BEDESMAN AND FOR A VOW HE HAD MADE TO SAINT ULTAN OF
ARBRACCAN HER GOODMAN HUSBAND WOULD NOT LET HER DEATH WHEREBY THEY WERE
ALL WONDROUS GRIEVED
TO WHOM YOUNG STEPHEN HAD THESE WORDS FOLLOWING
MURMUR SIRS IS EKE OFT AMONG LAY FOLK
BOTH BABE AND PARENT NOW
GLORIFY THEIR MAKER THE ONE IN LIMBO GLOOM THE OTHER IN PURGEFIRE
BUT GRAMERCY WHAT OF THOSE GODPOSSIBLED SOULS THAT WE NIGHTLY
IMPOSSIBILISE WHICH IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST VERY GOD LORD
AND GIVER OF LIFE FOR SIRS HE SAID OUR LUST IS BRIEF
WE ARE MEANS
TO THOSE SMALL CREATURES WITHIN US AND NATURE HAS OTHER ENDS THAN WE
THEN SAID DIXON JUNIOR TO PUNCH COSTELLO WIST HE WHAT ENDS
BUT HE HAD
OVERMUCH DRUNKEN AND THE BEST WORD HE COULD HAVE OF HIM WAS THAT HE
WOULD EVER DISHONEST A WOMAN WHOSO SHE WERE OR WIFE OR MAID OR LEMAN IF
IT SO FORTUNED HIM TO BE DELIVERED OF HIS SPLEEN OF LUSTIHEAD
WHEREAT
CROTTHERS OF ALBA LONGA SANG YOUNG MALACHI'S PRAISE OF THAT BEAST THE
UNICORN HOW ONCE IN THE MILLENNIUM HE COMETH BY HIS HORN THE OTHER ALL
THIS WHILE PRICKED FORWARD WITH THEIR JIBES WHEREWITH THEY DID MALICE
HIM WITNESSING ALL AND SEVERAL BY SAINT FOUTINUS HIS ENGINES THAT
HE WAS ABLE TO DO ANY MANNER OF THING THAT LAY IN MAN TO DO
THEREAT
LAUGHED THEY ALL RIGHT JOCUNDLY ONLY YOUNG STEPHEN AND SIR LEOPOLD WHICH
NEVER DURST LAUGH TOO OPEN BY REASON OF A STRANGE HUMOUR WHICH HE WOULD
NOT BEWRAY AND ALSO FOR THAT HE RUED FOR HER THAT BARE WHOSO SHE MIGHT
BE OR WHERESOEVER
THEN SPAKE YOUNG STEPHEN ORGULOUS OF MOTHER CHURCH
THAT WOULD CAST HIM OUT OF HER BOSOM OF LAW OF CANONS OF LILITH
PATRON OF ABORTIONS OF BIGNESS WROUGHT BY WIND OF SEEDS OF BRIGHTNESS
OR BY POTENCY OF VAMPIRES MOUTH TO MOUTH OR AS VIRGILIUS SAITH BY THE
INFLUENCE OF THE OCCIDENT OR BY THE REEK OF MOONFLOWER OR AN SHE LIE
WITH A WOMAN WHICH HER MAN HAS BUT LAIN WITH EFFECTU SECUTO OR
PERADVENTURE IN HER BATH ACCORDING TO THE OPINIONS OF AVERROES AND MOSES
MAIMONIDES
HE SAID ALSO HOW AT THE END OF THE SECOND MONTH A HUMAN SOUL
WAS INFUSED AND HOW IN ALL OUR HOLY MOTHER FOLDETH EVER SOULS FOR GOD'S
GREATER GLORY WHEREAS THAT EARTHLY MOTHER WHICH WAS BUT A DAM TO BEAR
BEASTLY SHOULD DIE BY CANON FOR SO SAITH HE THAT HOLDETH THE FISHERMAN'S
SEAL EVEN THAT BLESSED PETER ON WHICH ROCK WAS HOLY CHURCH FOR ALL AGES
FOUNDED
ALL THEY BACHELORS THEN ASKED OF SIR LEOPOLD WOULD HE IN LIKE
CASE SO JEOPARD HER PERSON AS RISK LIFE TO SAVE LIFE
A WARINESS OF
MIND HE WOULD ANSWER AS FITTED ALL AND LAYING HAND TO JAW HE SAID
DISSEMBLING AS HIS WONT WAS THAT AS IT WAS INFORMED HIM WHO HAD EVER
LOVED THE ART OF PHYSIC AS MIGHT A LAYMAN AND AGREEING ALSO WITH HIS
EXPERIENCE OF SO SELDOMSEEN AN ACCIDENT IT WAS GOOD FOR THAT MOTHER
CHURCH BELIKE AT ONE BLOW HAD BIRTH AND DEATH PENCE AND IN SUCH SORT
DELIVERLY HE SCAPED THEIR QUESTIONS
THAT IS TRUTH PARDY SAID DIXON
AND OR I ERR A PREGNANT WORD
WHICH HEARING YOUNG STEPHEN WAS A
MARVELLOUS GLAD MAN AND HE AVERRED THAT HE WHO STEALETH FROM THE POOR
LENDETH TO THE LORD FOR HE WAS OF A WILD MANNER WHEN HE WAS DRUNKEN AND
THAT HE WAS NOW IN THAT TAKING IT APPEARED EFTSOONS
BUT SIR LEOPOLD WAS PASSING GRAVE MAUGRE HIS WORD BY CAUSE HE STILL HAD
PITY OF THE TERRORCAUSING SHRIEKING OF SHRILL WOMEN IN THEIR LABOUR
AND AS HE WAS MINDED OF HIS GOOD LADY MARION THAT HAD BORNE HIM AN ONLY
MANCHILD WHICH ON HIS ELEVENTH DAY ON LIVE HAD DIED AND NO MAN OF ART
COULD SAVE SO DARK IS DESTINY
AND SHE WAS WONDROUS STRICKEN OF HEART
FOR THAT EVIL HAP AND FOR HIS BURIAL DID HIM ON A FAIR CORSELET OF
LAMB'S WOOL THE FLOWER OF THE FLOCK LEST HE MIGHT PERISH UTTERLY AND
LIE AKELED FOR IT WAS THEN ABOUT THE MIDST OF THE WINTER AND NOW SIR
LEOPOLD THAT HAD OF HIS BODY NO MANCHILD FOR AN HEIR LOOKED UPON HIM HIS
FRIEND'S SON AND WAS SHUT UP IN SORROW FOR HIS FOREPASSED HAPPINESS AND
AS SAD AS HE WAS THAT HIM FAILED A SON OF SUCH GENTLE COURAGE FOR ALL
ACCOUNTED HIM OF REAL PARTS SO GRIEVED HE ALSO IN NO LESS MEASURE
FOR YOUNG STEPHEN FOR THAT HE LIVED RIOTOUSLY WITH THOSE WASTRELS AND
MURDERED HIS GOODS WITH WHORES
ABOUT THAT PRESENT TIME YOUNG STEPHEN FILLED ALL CUPS THAT STOOD EMPTY
SO AS THERE REMAINED BUT LITTLE MO IF THE PRUDENTER HAD NOT SHADOWED
THEIR APPROACH FROM HIM THAT STILL PLIED IT VERY BUSILY WHO PRAYING FOR
THE INTENTIONS OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HE GAVE THEM FOR A PLEDGE THE
VICAR OF CHRIST WHICH ALSO AS HE SAID IS VICAR OF BRAY
NOW DRINK WE
QUOD HE OF THIS MAZER AND QUAFF YE THIS MEAD WHICH IS NOT INDEED PARCEL
OF MY BODY BUT MY SOUL'S BODIMENT
LEAVE YE FRACTION OF BREAD TO THEM
THAT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE
BE NOT AFEARD NEITHER FOR ANY WANT FOR THIS
WILL COMFORT MORE THAN THE OTHER WILL DISMAY
SEE YE HERE
AND HE SHOWED
THEM GLISTERING COINS OF THE TRIBUTE AND GOLDSMITH NOTES THE WORTH OF
TWO POUND NINETEEN SHILLING THAT HE HAD HE SAID FOR A SONG WHICH HE
WRIT
THEY ALL ADMIRED TO SEE THE FORESAID RICHES IN SUCH DEARTH OF
MONEY AS WAS HEREBEFORE
HIS WORDS WERE THEN THESE AS FOLLOWETH KNOW
ALL MEN HE SAID TIME'S RUINS BUILD ETERNITY'S MANSIONS
WHAT MEANS
THIS DESIRE'S WIND BLASTS THE THORNTREE BUT AFTER IT BECOMES FROM A
BRAMBLEBUSH TO BE A ROSE UPON THE ROOD OF TIME
MARK ME NOW
IN WOMAN'S
WOMB WORD IS MADE FLESH BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF THE MAKER ALL FLESH
THAT PASSES BECOMES THE WORD THAT SHALL NOT PASS AWAY
THIS IS THE

GENERATIONS AND THY DAYS OF OLD HOW THOU SETTEDST LITTLE BY ME AND BY
MY WORD AND BROUGHTEDST IN A STRANGER TO MY GATES TO COMMIT FORNICATION
IN MY SIGHT AND TO WAX FAT AND KICK LIKE JESHURUM
THEREFORE HAST THOU
SINNED AGAINST MY LIGHT AND HAST MADE ME THY LORD TO BE THE SLAVE OF
SERVANTS

WHY
HAST THOU DONE THIS ABOMINATION BEFORE ME THAT THOU DIDST SPURN ME FOR
A MERCHANT OF JALAPS AND DIDST DENY ME TO THE ROMAN AND TO THE INDIAN OF
DARK SPEECH WITH WHOM THY DAUGHTERS DID LIE LUXURIOUSLY LOOK FORTH NOW

SUN THOU HAST QUENCHED FOR EVER
AND THOU HAST LEFT ME ALONE FOR EVER
IN THE DARK WAYS OF MY BITTERNESS AND WITH A KISS OF ASHES HAST THOU
KISSED MY MOUTH
THIS TENEBROSITY OF THE INTERIOR HE PROCEEDED TO SAY
HATH NOT BEEN ILLUMINED BY THE WIT OF THE SEPTUAGINT NOR SO MUCH AS
MENTIONED FOR THE ORIENT FROM ON HIGH WHICH BRAKE HELL'S GATES VISITED A
DARKNESS THAT WAS FORANEOUS
ASSUEFACTION MINORATES ATROCITIES AS TULLY
SAITH OF HIS DARLING STOICS AND HAMLET HIS FATHER SHOWETH THE PRINCE NO
BLISTER OF COMBUSTION
THE ADIAPHANE IN THE NOON OF LIFE IS AN EGYPT'S
PLAGUE WHICH IN THE NIGHTS OF PRENATIVITY AND POSTMORTEMITY IS THEIR
MOST PROPER UBI AND QUOMODO
AND AS THE ENDS AND ULTIMATES OF
ALL THINGS ACCORD IN SOME MEAN AND MEASURE WITH THEIR INCEPTIONS AND
ORIGINALS THAT SAME MULTIPLICIT CONCORDANCE WHICH LEADS FORTH GROWTH
FROM BIRTH ACCOMPLISHING BY A RETROGRESSIVE METAMORPHOSIS THAT MINISHING
AND ABLATION TOWARDS THE FINAL WHICH IS AGREEABLE UNTO NATURE SO IS IT
WITH OUR SUBSOLAR BEING
THE AGED SISTERS DRAW US INTO LIFE WE WAIL
BATTEN SPORT CLIP CLASP SUNDER DWINDLE DIE OVER US DEAD THEY
BEND
FIRST SAVED FROM WATERS OF OLD NILE AMONG BULRUSHES A BED
OF FASCIATED WATTLES AT LAST THE CAVITY OF A MOUNTAIN AN OCCULTED
SEPULCHRE AMID THE CONCLAMATION OF THE HILLCAT AND THE OSSIFRAGE
AND AS
NO MAN KNOWS THE UBICITY OF HIS TUMULUS NOR TO WHAT PROCESSES WE SHALL
THEREBY BE USHERED NOR WHETHER TO TOPHET OR TO EDENVILLE IN THE LIKE WAY
IS ALL HIDDEN WHEN WE WOULD BACKWARD SEE FROM WHAT REGION OF REMOTENESS
THE WHATNESS OF OUR WHONESS HATH FETCHED HIS WHENCENESS
THERETO PUNCH COSTELLO ROARED OUT MAINLY ETIENNE CHANSON BUT HE LOUDLY
BID THEM LO WISDOM HATH BUILT HERSELF A HOUSE THIS VAST MAJESTIC
LONGSTABLISHED VAULT THE CRYSTAL PALACE OF THE CREATOR ALL IN APPLEPIE
ORDER A PENNY FOR HIM WHO FINDS THE PEA
BEHOLD THE MANSION REARED BY DEDAL JACK
SEE THE MALT STORED IN MANY A REFLUENT SACK
IN THE PROUD CIRQUE OF JACKJOHN'S BIVOUAC
A BLACK CRACK OF NOISE IN THE STREET HERE ALACK BAWLED BACK
LOUD ON
LEFT THOR THUNDERED IN ANGER AWFUL THE HAMMERHURLER
CAME NOW THE STORM
THAT HIST HIS HEART
AND MASTER LYNCH BADE HIM HAVE A CARE TO FLOUT AND
WITWANTON AS THE GOD SELF WAS ANGERED FOR HIS HELLPRATE AND PAGANRY
AND
HE THAT HAD ERST CHALLENGED TO BE SO DOUGHTY WAXED WAN AS THEY MIGHT ALL
MARK AND SHRANK TOGETHER AND HIS PITCH THAT WAS BEFORE SO HAUGHT UPLIFT
WAS NOW OF A SUDDEN QUITE PLUCKED DOWN AND HIS HEART SHOOK WITHIN THE
CAGE OF HIS BREAST AS HE TASTED THE RUMOUR OF THAT STORM
THEN DID SOME
MOCK AND SOME JEER AND PUNCH COSTELLO FELL HARD AGAIN TO HIS YALE WHICH
MASTER LENEHAN VOWED HE WOULD DO AFTER AND HE WAS INDEED BUT A WORD AND
A BLOW ON ANY THE LEAST COLOUR
BUT THE BRAGGART BOASTER CRIED THAT AN
OLD NOBODADDY WAS IN HIS CUPS IT WAS MUCHWHAT INDIFFERENT AND HE WOULD
NOT LAG BEHIND HIS LEAD
BUT THIS WAS ONLY TO DYE HIS DESPERATION AS
COWED HE CROUCHED IN HORNE'S HALL
HE DRANK INDEED AT ONE DRAUGHT TO
PLUCK UP A HEART OF ANY GRACE FOR IT THUNDERED LONG RUMBLINGLY OVER ALL
THE HEAVENS SO THAT MASTER MADDEN BEING GODLY CERTAIN WHILES KNOCKED
HIM ON HIS RIBS UPON THAT CRACK OF DOOM AND MASTER BLOOM AT THE
BRAGGART'S SIDE SPOKE TO HIM CALMING WORDS TO SLUMBER HIS GREAT FEAR
ADVERTISING HOW IT WAS NO OTHER THING BUT A HUBBUB NOISE THAT HE HEARD
THE DISCHARGE OF FLUID FROM THE THUNDERHEAD LOOK YOU HAVING TAKEN
PLACE AND ALL OF THE ORDER OF A NATURAL PHENOMENON
BUT WAS YOUNG BOASTHARD'S FEAR VANQUISHED BY CALMER'S WORDS NO FOR HE
HAD IN HIS BOSOM A SPIKE NAMED BITTERNESS WHICH COULD NOT BY WORDS BE
DONE AWAY
AND WAS HE THEN NEITHER CALM LIKE THE ONE NOR GODLY LIKE THE
OTHER HE WAS NEITHER AS MUCH AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE EITHER
BUT
COULD HE NOT HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO HAVE FOUND AGAIN AS IN HIS YOUTH THE
BOTTLE HOLINESS THAT THEN HE LIVED WITHAL INDEED NO FOR GRACE WAS NOT
THERE TO FIND THAT BOTTLE
HEARD HE THEN IN THAT CLAP THE VOICE OF THE
GOD BRINGFORTH OR WHAT CALMER SAID A HUBBUB OF PHENOMENON HEARD
WHY HE COULD NOT BUT HEAR UNLESS HE HAD PLUGGED HIM UP THE TUBE
UNDERSTANDING WHICH HE HAD NOT DONE
FOR THROUGH THAT TUBE HE SAW THAT
HE WAS IN THE LAND OF PHENOMENON WHERE HE MUST FOR A CERTAIN ONE DAY DIE
AS HE WAS LIKE THE REST TOO A PASSING SHOW
AND WOULD HE NOT ACCEPT TO
DIE LIKE THE REST AND PASS AWAY BY NO MEANS WOULD HE THOUGH HE MUST NOR
WOULD HE MAKE MORE SHOWS ACCORDING AS MEN DO WITH WIVES WHICH PHENOMENON
HAS COMMANDED THEM TO DO BY THE BOOK LAW
THEN WOTTED HE NOUGHT OF THAT
OTHER LAND WHICH IS CALLED BELIEVE ON ME THAT IS THE LAND OF PROMISE
WHICH BEHOVES TO THE KING DELIGHTFUL AND SHALL BE FOR EVER WHERE THERE
IS NO DEATH AND NO BIRTH NEITHER WIVING NOR MOTHERING AT WHICH ALL SHALL
COME AS MANY AS BELIEVE ON IT YES PIOUS HAD TOLD HIM OF THAT LAND AND
CHASTE HAD POINTED HIM TO THE WAY BUT THE REASON WAS THAT IN THE WAY HE
FELL IN WITH A CERTAIN WHORE OF AN EYEPLEASING EXTERIOR WHOSE NAME SHE
SAID IS BIRD IN THE HAND AND SHE BEGUILED HIM WRONGWAYS FROM THE TRUE
PATH BY HER FLATTERIES THAT SHE SAID TO HIM AS HO YOU PRETTY MAN TURN
ASIDE HITHER AND I WILL SHOW YOU A BRAVE PLACE AND SHE LAY AT HIM SO
FLATTERINGLY THAT SHE HAD HIM IN HER GROT WHICH IS NAMED TWO IN THE BUSH
OR BY SOME LEARNED CARNAL CONCUPISCENCE
THIS WAS IT WHAT ALL THAT COMPANY THAT SAT THERE AT COMMONS IN MANSE
OF MOTHERS THE MOST LUSTED AFTER AND IF THEY MET WITH THIS WHORE
BIRD IN THE HAND WHICH WAS WITHIN ALL FOUL PLAGUES MONSTERS AND A
WICKED DEVIL THEY WOULD STRAIN THE LAST BUT THEY WOULD MAKE AT HER AND
KNOW HER
FOR REGARDING BELIEVE ON ME THEY SAID IT WAS NOUGHT ELSE
BUT NOTION AND THEY COULD CONCEIVE NO THOUGHT OF IT FOR FIRST
TWO IN THE BUSH WHITHER SHE TICED THEM WAS THE VERY GOODLIEST GROT AND
IN IT WERE FOUR PILLOWS ON WHICH WERE FOUR TICKETS WITH THESE WORDS
PRINTED ON THEM PICKABACK AND TOPSYTURVY AND SHAMEFACE AND CHEEK BY
JOWL AND SECOND FOR THAT FOUL PLAGUE ALLPOX AND THE MONSTERS THEY
CARED NOT FOR THEM FOR PRESERVATIVE HAD GIVEN THEM A STOUT SHIELD OF
OXENGUT AND THIRD THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE NO HURT NEITHER FROM OFFSPRING
THAT WAS THAT WICKED DEVIL BY VIRTUE OF THIS SAME SHIELD WHICH WAS
NAMED KILLCHILD
SO WERE THEY ALL IN THEIR BLIND FANCY MR CAVIL AND MR
SOMETIMES GODLY MR APE SWILLALE MR FALSE FRANKLIN MR DAINTY DIXON
YOUNG BOASTHARD AND MR CAUTIOUS CALMER
WHEREIN O WRETCHED COMPANY
WERE YE ALL DECEIVED FOR THAT WAS THE VOICE OF THE GOD THAT WAS IN A
VERY GRIEVOUS RAGE THAT HE WOULD PRESENTLY LIFT HIS ARM UP AND
SPILL THEIR SOULS FOR THEIR ABUSES AND THEIR SPILLINGS DONE BY THEM

FOR A PROGNOSTICATION OF MALACHI'S ALMANAC AND I HEAR THAT MR RUSSELL
HAS DONE A PROPHETICAL CHARM OF THE SAME GIST OUT OF THE HINDUSTANISH
FOR HIS FARMER'S GAZETTE TO HAVE THREE THINGS IN ALL BUT THIS A MERE
FETCH WITHOUT BOTTOM OF REASON FOR OLD CRONES AND BAIRNS YET SOMETIMES
THEY ARE FOUND IN THE RIGHT GUESS WITH THEIR QUEERITIES NO TELLING HOW
WITH THIS CAME UP LENEHAN TO THE FEET OF THE TABLE TO SAY HOW THE LETTER
WAS IN THAT NIGHT'S GAZETTE AND HE MADE A SHOW TO FIND IT ABOUT HIM
FOR HE SWORE WITH AN OATH THAT HE HAD BEEN AT PAINS ABOUT IT BUT ON
STEPHEN'S PERSUASION HE GAVE OVER THE SEARCH AND WAS BIDDEN TO SIT NEAR
BY WHICH HE DID MIGHTY BRISK
HE WAS A KIND OF SPORT GENTLEMAN THAT
WENT FOR A MERRYANDREW OR HONEST PICKLE AND WHAT BELONGED OF WOMEN
HORSEFLESH OR HOT SCANDAL HE HAD IT PAT
TO TELL THE TRUTH HE WAS MEAN
IN FORTUNES AND FOR THE MOST PART HANKERED ABOUT THE COFFEEHOUSES
AND LOW TAVERNS WITH CRIMPS OSTLERS BOOKIES PAUL'S MEN RUNNERS
FLATCAPS WAISTCOATEERS LADIES OF THE BAGNIO AND OTHER ROGUES OF THE
GAME OR WITH A CHANCEABLE CATCHPOLE OR A TIPSTAFF OFTEN AT NIGHTS
TILL BROAD DAY OF WHOM HE PICKED UP BETWEEN HIS SACKPOSSETS MUCH LOOSE
GOSSIP
HE TOOK HIS ORDINARY AT A BOILINGCOOK'S AND IF HE HAD BUT GOTTEN
INTO HIM A MESS OF BROKEN VICTUALS OR A PLATTER OF TRIPES WITH A BARE
TESTER IN HIS PURSE HE COULD ALWAYS BRING HIMSELF OFF WITH HIS TONGUE
SOME RANDY QUIP HE HAD FROM A PUNK OR WHATNOT THAT EVERY MOTHER'S SON OF
THEM WOULD BURST THEIR SIDES
THE OTHER COSTELLO THAT IS HEARING THIS
TALK ASKED WAS IT POETRY OR A TALE
FAITH NO HE SAYS FRANK THAT WAS
HIS NAME 'TIS ALL ABOUT KERRY COWS THAT ARE TO BE BUTCHERED ALONG OF
THE PLAGUE
BUT THEY CAN GO HANG SAYS HE WITH A WINK FOR ME WITH THEIR
BULLY BEEF A POX ON IT
THERE'S AS GOOD FISH IN THIS TIN AS EVER CAME
OUT OF IT AND VERY FRIENDLY HE OFFERED TO TAKE OF SOME SALTY SPRATS THAT
STOOD BY WHICH HE HAD EYED WISHLY IN THE MEANTIME AND FOUND THE PLACE
WHICH WAS INDEED THE CHIEF DESIGN OF HIS EMBASSY AS HE WAS SHARPSET
MORT AUX VACHES SAYS FRANK THEN IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE THAT HAD BEEN
INDENTURED TO A BRANDYSHIPPER THAT HAS A WINELODGE IN BORDEAUX AND HE
SPOKE FRENCH LIKE A GENTLEMAN TOO
FROM A CHILD THIS FRANK HAD BEEN
A DONOUGHT THAT HIS FATHER A HEADBOROUGH WHO COULD ILL KEEP HIM TO
SCHOOL TO LEARN HIS LETTERS AND THE USE OF THE GLOBES MATRICULATED AT
THE UNIVERSITY TO STUDY THE MECHANICS BUT HE TOOK THE BIT BETWEEN HIS
TEETH LIKE A RAW COLT AND WAS MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE JUSTICIARY AND THE
PARISH BEADLE THAN WITH HIS VOLUMES
ONE TIME HE WOULD BE A PLAYACTOR
THEN A SUTLER OR A WELSHER THEN NOUGHT WOULD KEEP HIM FROM THE BEARPIT
AND THE COCKING MAIN THEN HE WAS FOR THE OCEAN SEA OR TO HOOF IT ON
THE ROADS WITH THE ROMANY FOLK KIDNAPPING A SQUIRE'S HEIR BY FAVOUR OF
MOONLIGHT OR FECKING MAIDS' LINEN OR CHOKING CHICKEN BEHIND A HEDGE
HE
HAD BEEN OFF AS MANY TIMES AS A CAT HAS LIVES AND BACK AGAIN WITH NAKED
POCKETS AS MANY MORE TO HIS FATHER THE HEADBOROUGH WHO SHED A PINT
OF TEARS AS OFTEN AS HE SAW HIM
WHAT SAYS MR LEOPOLD WITH HIS HANDS
ACROSS THAT WAS EARNEST TO KNOW THE DRIFT OF IT WILL THEY SLAUGHTER
ALL I PROTEST I SAW THEM BUT THIS DAY MORNING GOING TO THE LIVERPOOL
BOATS SAYS HE
I CAN SCARCE BELIEVE 'TIS SO BAD SAYS HE
AND HE HAD
EXPERIENCE OF THE LIKE BROOD BEASTS AND OF SPRINGERS GREASY HOGGETS AND
WETHER WOOL HAVING BEEN SOME YEARS BEFORE ACTUARY FOR MR JOSEPH CUFFE
A WORTHY SALESMASTER THAT DROVE HIS TRADE FOR LIVE STOCK AND MEADOW
AUCTIONS HARD BY MR GAVIN LOW'S YARD IN PRUSSIA STREET
I QUESTION WITH
YOU THERE SAYS HE
MORE LIKE 'TIS THE HOOSE OR THE TIMBER TONGUE
MR
STEPHEN A LITTLE MOVED BUT VERY HANDSOMELY TOLD HIM NO SUCH MATTER AND
THAT HE HAD DISPATCHES FROM THE EMPEROR'S CHIEF TAILTICKLER THANKING
HIM FOR THE HOSPITALITY THAT WAS SENDING OVER DOCTOR RINDERPEST THE
BESTQUOTED COWCATCHER IN ALL MUSCOVY WITH A BOLUS OR TWO OF PHYSIC TO
TAKE THE BULL BY THE HORNS
COME COME SAYS MR VINCENT PLAIN DEALING
HE'LL FIND HIMSELF ON THE HORNS OF A DILEMMA IF HE MEDDLES WITH A
BULL THAT'S IRISH SAYS HE
IRISH BY NAME AND IRISH BY NATURE SAYS MR
STEPHEN AND HE SENT THE ALE PURLING ABOUT AN IRISH BULL IN AN ENGLISH
CHINASHOP
I CONCEIVE YOU SAYS MR DIXON
IT IS THAT SAME BULL THAT WAS
SENT TO OUR ISLAND BY FARMER NICHOLAS THE BRAVEST CATTLEBREEDER OF THEM
ALL WITH AN EMERALD RING IN HIS NOSE
TRUE FOR YOU SAYS MR VINCENT
CROSS THE TABLE AND A BULLSEYE INTO THE BARGAIN SAYS HE AND A PLUMPER
AND A PORTLIER BULL SAYS HE NEVER SHIT ON SHAMROCK
HE HAD HORNS
GALORE A COAT OF CLOTH OF GOLD AND A SWEET SMOKY BREATH COMING OUT OF
HIS NOSTRILS SO THAT THE WOMEN OF OUR ISLAND LEAVING DOUGHBALLS AND
ROLLINGPINS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM HANGING HIS BULLINESS IN DAISYCHAINS
WHAT FOR THAT SAYS MR DIXON BUT BEFORE HE CAME OVER FARMER NICHOLAS
THAT WAS A EUNUCH HAD HIM PROPERLY GELDED BY A COLLEGE OF DOCTORS WHO
WERE NO BETTER OFF THAN HIMSELF
SO BE OFF NOW SAYS HE AND DO ALL MY
COUSIN GERMAN THE LORD HARRY TELLS YOU AND TAKE A FARMER'S BLESSING AND
WITH THAT HE SLAPPED HIS POSTERIORS VERY SOUNDLY
BUT THE SLAP AND THE
BLESSING STOOD HIM FRIEND SAYS MR VINCENT FOR TO MAKE UP HE TAUGHT HIM
A TRICK WORTH TWO OF THE OTHER SO THAT MAID WIFE ABBESS AND WIDOW TO
THIS DAY AFFIRM THAT THEY WOULD RATHER ANY TIME OF THE MONTH WHISPER
IN HIS EAR IN THE DARK OF A COWHOUSE OR GET A LICK ON THE NAPE FROM HIS
LONG HOLY TONGUE THAN LIE WITH THE FINEST STRAPPING YOUNG RAVISHER IN
THE FOUR FIELDS OF ALL IRELAND
ANOTHER THEN PUT IN HIS WORD AND THEY
DRESSED HIM SAYS HE IN A POINT SHIFT AND PETTICOAT WITH A TIPPET AND
GIRDLE AND RUFFLES ON HIS WRISTS AND CLIPPED HIS FORELOCK AND RUBBED HIM
ALL OVER WITH SPERMACETIC OIL AND BUILT STABLES FOR HIM AT EVERY TURN OF
THE ROAD WITH A GOLD MANGER IN EACH FULL OF THE BEST HAY IN THE MARKET
SO THAT HE COULD DOSS AND DUNG TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT
BY THIS TIME THE
FATHER OF THE FAITHFUL FOR SO THEY CALLED HIM WAS GROWN SO HEAVY THAT
HE COULD SCARCE WALK TO PASTURE
TO REMEDY WHICH OUR COZENING DAMES AND
DAMSELS BROUGHT HIM HIS FODDER IN THEIR APRONLAPS AND AS SOON AS HIS
BELLY WAS FULL HE WOULD REAR UP ON HIS HIND UARTERS TO SHOW THEIR
LADYSHIPS A MYSTERY AND ROAR AND BELLOW OUT OF HIM IN BULLS' LANGUAGE
AND THEY ALL AFTER HIM
AY SAYS ANOTHER AND SO PAMPERED WAS HE THAT HE
WOULD SUFFER NOUGHT TO GROW IN ALL THE LAND BUT GREEN GRASS FOR HIMSELF
FOR THAT WAS THE ONLY COLOUR TO HIS MIND AND THERE WAS A BOARD PUT UP
ON A HILLOCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLAND WITH A PRINTED NOTICE SAYING
BY THE LORD HARRY GREEN IS THE GRASS THAT GROWS ON THE GROUND
AND
SAYS MR DIXON IF EVER HE GOT SCENT OF A CATTLERAIDER IN ROSCOMMON OR
THE WILDS OF CONNEMARA OR A HUSBANDMAN IN SLIGO THAT WAS SOWING AS MUCH
AS A HANDFUL OF MUSTARD OR A BAG OF RAPESEED OUT HE'D RUN AMOK OVER HALF
THE COUNTRYSIDE ROOTING UP WITH HIS HORNS WHATEVER WAS PLANTED AND ALL
BY LORD HARRY'S ORDERS
THERE WAS BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THEM AT FIRST SAYS
MR VINCENT AND THE LORD HARRY CALLED FARMER NICHOLAS ALL THE OLD NICKS
IN THE WORLD AND AN OLD WHOREMASTER THAT KEPT SEVEN TRULLS IN HIS HOUSE
AND I'LL MEDDLE IN HIS MATTERS SAYS HE
I'LL MAKE THAT ANIMAL SMELL
HELL SAYS HE WITH THE HELP OF THAT GOOD PIZZLE MY FATHER LEFT ME
BUT
ONE EVENING SAYS MR DIXON WHEN THE LORD HARRY WAS CLEANING HIS ROYAL
PELT TO GO TO DINNER AFTER WINNING A BOATRACE HE HAD SPADE OARS FOR
HIMSELF BUT THE FIRST RULE OF THE COURSE WAS THAT THE OTHERS WERE TO ROW
WITH PITCHFORKS HE DISCOVERED IN HIMSELF A WONDERFUL LIKENESS TO A BULL
AND ON PICKING UP A BLACKTHUMBED CHAPBOOK THAT HE KEPT IN THE PANTRY
HE FOUND SURE ENOUGH THAT HE WAS A LEFTHANDED DESCENDANT OF THE FAMOUS
CHAMPION BULL OF THE ROMANS BOS BOVUM WHICH IS GOOD BOG LATIN FOR
BOSS OF THE SHOW
AFTER THAT SAYS MR VINCENT THE LORD HARRY PUT HIS
HEAD INTO A COW'S DRINKINGTROUGH IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HIS COURTIERS
AND PULLING IT OUT AGAIN TOLD THEM ALL HIS NEW NAME
THEN WITH THE
WATER RUNNING OFF HIM HE GOT INTO AN OLD SMOCK AND SKIRT THAT HAD
BELONGED TO HIS GRANDMOTHER AND BOUGHT A GRAMMAR OF THE BULLS' LANGUAGE
TO STUDY BUT HE COULD NEVER LEARN A WORD OF IT EXCEPT THE FIRST PERSONAL
PRONOUN WHICH HE COPIED OUT BIG AND GOT OFF BY HEART AND IF EVER HE WENT
OUT FOR A WALK HE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CHALK TO WRITE IT UPON WHAT
TOOK HIS FANCY THE SIDE OF A ROCK OR A TEAHOUSE TABLE OR A BALE OF
COTTON OR A CORKFLOAT
IN SHORT HE AND THE BULL OF IRELAND WERE SOON AS
FAST FRIENDS AS AN ARSE AND A SHIRT
THEY WERE SAYS MR STEPHEN AND
THE END WAS THAT THE MEN OF THE ISLAND SEEING NO HELP WAS TOWARD AS
THE UNGRATE WOMEN WERE ALL OF ONE MIND MADE A WHERRY RAFT LOADED
THEMSELVES AND THEIR BUNDLES OF CHATTELS ON SHIPBOARD SET ALL MASTS
ERECT MANNED THE YARDS SPRANG THEIR LUFF HEAVED TO SPREAD THREE
SHEETS IN THE WIND PUT HER HEAD BETWEEN WIND AND WATER WEIGHED ANCHOR
PORTED HER HELM RAN UP THE JOLLY ROGER GAVE THREE TIMES THREE LET THE
BULLGINE RUN PUSHED OFF IN THEIR BUMBOAT AND PUT TO SEA TO RECOVER
THE MAIN OF AMERICA
WHICH WAS THE OCCASION SAYS MR VINCENT OF THE
COMPOSING BY A BOATSWAIN OF THAT ROLLICKING CHANTY
POPE PETER'S BUT A PISSABED
A MAN'S A MAN FOR A' THAT
OUR WORTHY ACQUAINTANCE MR MALACHI MULLIGAN NOW APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
AS THE STUDENTS WERE FINISHING THEIR APOLOGUE ACCOMPANIED WITH A FRIEND
WHOM HE HAD JUST RENCOUNTERED A YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIS NAME ALEC BANNON
WHO HAD LATE COME TO TOWN IT BEING HIS INTENTION TO BUY A COLOUR OR A
CORNETCY IN THE FENCIBLES AND LIST FOR THE WARS
MR MULLIGAN WAS CIVIL
ENOUGH TO EXPRESS SOME RELISH OF IT ALL THE MORE AS IT JUMPED WITH A
PROJECT OF HIS OWN FOR THE CURE OF THE VERY EVIL THAT HAD BEEN TOUCHED
ON
WHEREAT HE HANDED ROUND TO THE COMPANY A SET OF PASTEBOARD CARDS
WHICH HE HAD HAD PRINTED THAT DAY AT MR QUINNELL'S BEARING A LEGEND
PRINTED IN FAIR ITALICS MR MALACHI MULLIGAN
FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR

I MAKE NO DOUBT IT
SMACKS OF WENCHING
COME BE SEATED BOTH
'TIS AS CHEAP SITTING AS
STANDING
MR MULLIGAN ACCEPTED OF THE INVITATION AND EXPATIATING UPON
HIS DESIGN TOLD HIS HEARERS THAT HE HAD BEEN LED INTO THIS THOUGHT BY
A CONSIDERATION OF THE CAUSES OF STERILITY BOTH THE INHIBITORY AND THE
PROHIBITORY WHETHER THE INHIBITION IN ITS TURN WERE DUE TO CONJUGAL
VEXATIONS OR TO A PARSIMONY OF THE BALANCE AS WELL AS WHETHER THE
PROHIBITION PROCEEDED FROM DEFECTS CONGENITAL OR FROM PROCLIVITIES
ACQUIRED
IT GRIEVED HIM PLAGUILY HE SAID TO SEE THE NUPTIAL COUCH
DEFRAUDED OF ITS DEAREST PLEDGES AND TO REFLECT UPON SO MANY AGREEABLE
FEMALES WITH RICH JOINTURES A PREY TO THE VILEST BONZES WHO HIDE THEIR
FLAMBEAU UNDER A BUSHEL IN AN UNCONGENIAL CLOISTER OR LOSE THEIR WOMANLY
BLOOM IN THE EMBRACES OF SOME UNACCOUNTABLE MUSKIN WHEN THEY MIGHT
MULTIPLY THE INLETS OF HAPPINESS SACRIFICING THE INESTIMABLE JEWEL OF
THEIR SEX WHEN A HUNDRED PRETTY FELLOWS WERE AT HAND TO CARESS THIS HE
ASSURED THEM MADE HIS HEART WEEP
TO CURB THIS INCONVENIENT WHICH
HE CONCLUDED DUE TO A SUPPRESSION OF LATENT HEAT HAVING ADVISED WITH
CERTAIN COUNSELLORS OF WORTH AND INSPECTED INTO THIS MATTER HE HAD
RESOLVED TO PURCHASE IN FEE SIMPLE FOR EVER THE FREEHOLD OF LAMBAY
ISLAND FROM ITS HOLDER LORD TALBOT DE MALAHIDE A TORY GENTLEMAN OF
NOTE MUCH IN FAVOUR WITH OUR ASCENDANCY PARTY

THERE A NATIONAL FERTILISING FARM TO BE NAMED OMPHALOS WITH AN OBELISK
HEWN AND ERECTED AFTER THE FASHION OF EGYPT AND TO OFFER HIS DUTIFUL
YEOMAN SERVICES FOR THE FECUNDATION OF ANY FEMALE OF WHAT GRADE OF LIFE
SOEVER WHO SHOULD THERE DIRECT TO HIM WITH THE DESIRE OF FULFILLING THE
FUNCTIONS OF HER NATURAL

TAKE A PENNY FOR HIS PAINS
THE POOREST KITCHENWENCH NO LESS THAN THE
OPULENT LADY OF FASHION IF SO BE THEIR CONSTRUCTIONS AND THEIR TEMPERS
WERE WARM PERSUADERS FOR THEIR PETITIONS WOULD FIND IN HIM THEIR MAN
FOR HIS NUTRIMENT HE SHEWED HOW HE WOULD FEED HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY UPON A
DIET OF SAVOURY TUBERCLES AND FISH AND CONEYS THERE THE FLESH OF THESE
LATTER PROLIFIC RODENTS BEING HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR HIS PURPOSE BOTH
BROILED AND STEWED WITH A BLADE OF MACE AND A POD OR TWO OF CAPSICUM
CHILLIES
AFTER THIS HOMILY WHICH HE DELIVERED WITH MUCH WARMTH OF
ASSEVERATION MR MULLIGAN IN A TRICE PUT OFF FROM HIS HAT A KERCHIEF WITH
WHICH HE HAD SHIELDED IT
THEY BOTH IT SEEMS HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY THE
RAIN AND FOR ALL THEIR MENDING THEIR PACE HAD TAKEN WATER AS MIGHT BE
OBSERVED BY MR MULLIGAN'S SMALLCLOTHES OF A HODDEN GREY WHICH WAS NOW
SOMEWHAT PIEBALD
HIS PROJECT MEANWHILE WAS VERY FAVOURABLY ENTERTAINED
BY HIS AUDITORS AND WON HEARTY EULOGIES FROM ALL THOUGH MR DIXON OF
MARY'S EXCEPTED TO IT ASKING WITH A FINICKING AIR DID HE PURPOSE ALSO
TO CARRY COALS TO NEWCASTLE
MR MULLIGAN HOWEVER MADE COURT TO THE

WIT HE DROVE HOME HIS POINT BY ANALOGIES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM MORE
SUITABLE TO THEIR STOMACH THE BUCK AND DOE OF THE FOREST GLADE THE
FARMYARD DRAKE AND DUCK
VALUING HIMSELF NOT A LITTLE UPON HIS ELEGANCE BEING INDEED A PROPER
MAN OF PERSON THIS TALKATIVE NOW APPLIED HIMSELF TO HIS DRESS WITH
ANIMADVERSIONS OF SOME HEAT UPON THE SUDDEN WHIMSY OF THE ATMOSPHERICS
WHILE THE COMPANY LAVISHED THEIR ENCOMIUMS UPON THE PROJECT HE HAD
ADVANCED
THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIS FRIEND OVERJOYED AS HE WAS AT A
PASSAGE THAT HAD LATE BEFALLEN HIM COULD NOT FORBEAR TO TELL IT HIS
NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
MR MULLIGAN NOW PERCEIVING THE TABLE ASKED FOR WHOM
WERE THOSE LOAVES AND FISHES AND SEEING THE STRANGER HE MADE HIM
A CIVIL BOW AND SAID PRAY SIR WAS YOU IN NEED OF ANY PROFESSIONAL
ASSISTANCE WE COULD GIVE WHO UPON HIS OFFER THANKED HIM VERY
HEARTILY THOUGH PRESERVING HIS PROPER DISTANCE AND REPLIED THAT HE WAS
COME THERE ABOUT A LADY NOW AN INMATE OF HORNE'S HOUSE THAT WAS IN AN
INTERESTING CONDITION POOR BODY FROM WOMAN'S WOE AND HERE HE FETCHED
A DEEP SIGH TO KNOW IF HER HAPPINESS HAD YET TAKEN PLACE
MR DIXON
TO TURN THE TABLE TOOK ON TO ASK OF MR MULLIGAN HIMSELF WHETHER
HIS INCIPIENT VENTRIPOTENCE UPON WHICH HE RALLIED HIM BETOKENED AN
OVOBLASTIC GESTATION IN THE PROSTATIC UTRICLE OR MALE WOMB OR WAS DUE
AS WITH THE NOTED PHYSICIAN MR AUSTIN MELDON TO A WOLF IN THE STOMACH
FOR ANSWER MR MULLIGAN IN A GALE OF LAUGHTER AT HIS SMALLS SMOTE
HIMSELF BRAVELY BELOW THE DIAPHRAGM EXCLAIMING WITH AN ADMIRABLE DROLL
MIMIC OF MOTHER GROGAN THE MOST EXCELLENT CREATURE OF HER SEX THOUGH
'TIS PITY SHE'S A TROLLOP THERE'S A BELLY THAT NEVER BORE A BASTARD
THIS WAS SO HAPPY A CONCEIT THAT IT RENEWED THE STORM OF MIRTH AND THREW
THE WHOLE ROOM INTO THE MOST VIOLENT AGITATIONS OF DELIGHT
THE SPRY
RATTLE HAD RUN ON IN THE SAME VEIN OF MIMICRY BUT FOR SOME LARUM IN THE
ANTECHAMBER
HERE THE LISTENER WHO WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE SCOTCH STUDENT A LITTLE
FUME OF A FELLOW BLOND AS TOW CONGRATULATED IN THE LIVELIEST FASHION
WITH THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND INTERRUPTING THE NARRATIVE AT A SALIENT
POINT HAVING DESIRED HIS VISAVIS WITH A POLITE BECK TO HAVE THE
OBLIGINGNESS TO PASS HIM A FLAGON OF CORDIAL WATERS AT THE SAME TIME BY
A QUESTIONING POISE OF THE HEAD A WHOLE CENTURY OF POLITE BREEDING HAD
NOT ACHIEVED SO NICE A GESTURE TO WHICH WAS UNITED AN EQUIVALENT BUT
CONTRARY BALANCE OF THE BOTTLE ASKED THE NARRATOR AS PLAINLY AS WAS EVER
DONE IN WORDS IF HE MIGHT TREAT HIM WITH A CUP OF IT
MAIS BIEN SR
NOBLE STRANGER SAID HE CHEERILY ET MILLE COMPLIMENTS
THAT YOU MAY
AND VERY OPPORTUNELY
THERE WANTED NOTHING BUT THIS CUP TO CROWN MY
FELICITY
BUT GRACIOUS HEAVEN WAS I LEFT WITH BUT A CRUST IN MY WALLET
AND A CUPFUL OF WATER FROM THE WELL MY GOD I WOULD ACCEPT OF THEM AND
FIND IT IN MY HEART TO KNEEL DOWN UPON THE GROUND AND GIVE THANKS TO
THE POWERS ABOVE FOR THE HAPPINESS VOUCHSAFED ME BY THE GIVER OF GOOD
THINGS
WITH THESE WORDS HE APPROACHED THE GOBLET TO HIS LIPS TOOK A
COMPLACENT DRAUGHT OF THE CORDIAL SLICKED HIS HAIR AND OPENING HIS
BOSOM OUT POPPED A LOCKET THAT HUNG FROM A SILK RIBAND THAT VERY
PICTURE WHICH HE HAD CHERISHED EVER SINCE HER HAND HAD WROTE THEREIN
GAZING UPON THOSE FEATURES WITH A WORLD OF TENDERNESS AH MONSIEUR HE
SAID HAD YOU BUT BEHELD HER AS I DID WITH THESE EYES AT THAT AFFECTING
INSTANT WITH HER DAINTY TUCKER AND HER NEW COQUETTE CAP A GIFT FOR HER
FEASTDAY AS SHE TOLD ME PRETTILY IN SUCH AN ARTLESS DISORDER OF SO
MELTING A TENDERNESS 'PON MY CONSCIENCE EVEN YOU MONSIEUR HAD BEEN
IMPELLED BY GENEROUS NATURE TO DELIVER YOURSELF WHOLLY INTO THE HANDS OF
SUCH AN ENEMY OR TO QUIT THE FIELD FOR EVER
I DECLARE I WAS NEVER SO
TOUCHED IN ALL MY LIFE
GOD I THANK THEE AS THE AUTHOR OF MY DAYS
THRICE HAPPY WILL HE BE WHOM SO AMIABLE A CREATURE WILL BLESS WITH HER
FAVOURS
A SIGH OF AFFECTION GAVE ELOQUENCE TO THESE WORDS AND HAVING
REPLACED THE LOCKET IN HIS BOSOM HE WIPED HIS EYE AND SIGHED AGAIN
BENEFICENT DISSEMINATOR OF BLESSINGS TO ALL THY CREATURES HOW GREAT
AND UNIVERSAL MUST BE THAT SWEETEST OF THY TYRANNIES WHICH CAN HOLD IN
THRALL THE FREE AND THE BOND THE SIMPLE SWAIN AND THE POLISHED COXCOMB
THE LOVER IN THE HEYDAY OF RECKLESS PASSION AND THE HUSBAND OF MATURER
YEARS
BUT INDEED SIR I WANDER FROM THE POINT
HOW MINGLED AND
IMPERFECT ARE ALL OUR SUBLUNARY JOYS
MALEDICITY HE EXCLAIMED IN
ANGUISH
WOULD TO GOD THAT FORESIGHT HAD BUT REMEMBERED ME TO TAKE MY
CLOAK ALONG I COULD WEEP TO THINK OF IT
THEN THOUGH IT HAD POURED
SEVEN SHOWERS WE WERE NEITHER OF US A PENNY THE WORSE
BUT BESHREW ME
HE CRIED CLAPPING HAND TO HIS FOREHEAD TOMORROW WILL BE A NEW DAY AND
THOUSAND THUNDERS I KNOW OF A MARCHAND DE CAPOTES MONSIEUR POYNTZ
FROM WHOM I CAN HAVE FOR A LIVRE AS SNUG A CLOAK OF THE FRENCH FASHION
AS EVER KEPT A LADY FROM WETTING
TUT TUT CRIES LE FECONDATEUR
TRIPPING IN MY FRIEND MONSIEUR MOORE THAT MOST ACCOMPLISHED TRAVELLER
I HAVE JUST CRACKED A HALF BOTTLE AVEC LUI IN A CIRCLE OF THE BEST WITS
OF THE TOWN IS MY AUTHORITY THAT IN CAPE HORN VENTRE BICHE THEY
HAVE A RAIN THAT WILL WET THROUGH ANY EVEN THE STOUTEST CLOAK
A
DRENCHING OF THAT VIOLENCE HE TELLS ME SANS BLAGUE HAS SENT MORE
THAN ONE LUCKLESS FELLOW IN GOOD EARNEST POSTHASTE TO ANOTHER WORLD
POOH A LIVRE CRIES MONSIEUR LYNCH
THE CLUMSY THINGS ARE DEAR AT A
SOU
ONE UMBRELLA WERE IT NO BIGGER THAN A FAIRY MUSHROOM IS WORTH TEN
SUCH STOPGAPS
NO WOMAN OF ANY WIT WOULD WEAR ONE
MY DEAR KITTY TOLD ME
TODAY THAT SHE WOULD DANCE IN A DELUGE BEFORE EVER SHE WOULD STARVE IN
SUCH AN ARK OF SALVATION FOR AS SHE REMINDED ME BLUSHING PIQUANTLY AND
WHISPERING IN MY EAR THOUGH THERE WAS NONE TO SNAP HER WORDS BUT GIDDY
BUTTERFLIES DAME NATURE BY THE DIVINE BLESSING HAS IMPLANTED IT IN
OUR HEARTS AND IT HAS BECOME A HOUSEHOLD WORD THAT IL Y A DEUX CHOSES
FOR WHICH THE INNOCENCE OF OUR ORIGINAL GARB IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES A
BREACH OF THE PROPRIETIES IS THE FITTEST NAY THE ONLY GARMENT
THE
FIRST SAID SHE AND HERE MY PRETTY PHILOSOPHER AS I HANDED HER TO HER
TILBURY TO FIX MY ATTENTION GENTLY TIPPED WITH HER TONGUE THE OUTER
CHAMBER OF MY EAR THE FIRST IS A BATH
BUT AT THIS POINT A BELL
TINKLING IN THE HALL CUT SHORT A DISCOURSE WHICH PROMISED SO BRAVELY FOR
THE ENRICHMENT OF OUR STORE OF KNOWLEDGE
AMID THE GENERAL VACANT HILARITY OF THE ASSEMBLY A BELL RANG AND WHILE
ALL WERE CONJECTURING WHAT MIGHT BE THE CAUSE MISS CALLAN ENTERED AND
HAVING SPOKEN A FEW WORDS IN A LOW TONE TO YOUNG MR DIXON RETIRED WITH
A PROFOUND BOW TO THE COMPANY
THE PRESENCE EVEN FOR A MOMENT AMONG A
PARTY OF DEBAUCHEES OF A WOMAN ENDUED WITH EVERY QUALITY OF MODESTY AND
NOT LESS SEVERE THAN BEAUTIFUL REFRAINED THE HUMOUROUS SALLIES EVEN OF
THE MOST LICENTIOUS BUT HER DEPARTURE WAS THE SIGNAL FOR AN OUTBREAK OF
RIBALDRY
STRIKE ME SILLY SAID COSTELLO A LOW FELLOW WHO WAS FUDDLED
A MONSTROUS FINE BIT OF COWFLESH I'LL BE SWORN SHE HAS RENDEZVOUSED
YOU
WHAT YOU DOG HAVE YOU A WAY WITH THEM GAD'S BUD IMMENSELY
SO SAID MR LYNCH
THE BEDSIDE MANNER IT IS THAT THEY USE IN THE MATER
HOSPICE
DEMME DOES NOT DOCTOR O'GARGLE CHUCK THE NUNS THERE UNDER THE
CHIN
AS I LOOK TO BE SAVED I HAD IT FROM MY KITTY WHO HAS BEEN WARDMAID
THERE ANY TIME THESE SEVEN MONTHS
LAWKSAMERCY DOCTOR CRIED THE YOUNG
BLOOD IN THE PRIMROSE VEST FEIGNING A WOMANISH SIMPER AND WITH IMMODEST
SQUIRMINGS OF HIS BODY HOW YOU DO TEASE A BODY DRAT THE MAN BLESS
ME I'M ALL OF A WIBBLY WOBBLY
WHY YOU'RE AS BAD AS DEAR LITTLE FATHER
CANTEKISSEM THAT YOU ARE MAY THIS POT OF FOUR HALF CHOKE ME CRIED
COSTELLO IF SHE AINT IN THE FAMILY WAY
I KNOWS A LADY WHAT'S GOT A
WHITE SWELLING QUICK AS I CLAPS EYES ON HER
THE YOUNG SURGEON HOWEVER
ROSE AND BEGGED THE COMPANY TO EXCUSE HIS RETREAT AS THE NURSE HAD JUST
THEN INFORMED HIM THAT HE WAS NEEDED IN THE WARD
MERCIFUL PROVIDENCE
HAD BEEN PLEASED TO PUT A PERIOD TO THE SUFFERINGS OF THE LADY WHO WAS
ENCEINTE WHICH SHE HAD BORNE WITH A LAUDABLE FORTITUDE AND SHE HAD
GIVEN BIRTH TO A BOUNCING BOY
I WANT PATIENCE SAID HE WITH THOSE
WHO WITHOUT WIT TO ENLIVEN OR LEARNING TO INSTRUCT REVILE AN ENNOBLING
PROFESSION WHICH SAVING THE REVERENCE DUE TO THE DEITY IS THE GREATEST
POWER FOR HAPPINESS UPON THE EARTH
I AM POSITIVE WHEN I SAY THAT IF
NEED WERE I COULD PRODUCE A CLOUD OF WITNESSES TO THE EXCELLENCE OF
HER NOBLE EXERCITATIONS WHICH SO FAR FROM BEING A BYWORD SHOULD BE A
GLORIOUS INCENTIVE IN THE HUMAN BREAST
I CANNOT AWAY WITH THEM
WHAT
MALIGN SUCH AN ONE THE AMIABLE MISS CALLAN WHO IS THE LUSTRE OF
HER OWN SEX AND THE ASTONISHMENT OF OURS AND AT AN INSTANT THE MOST
MOMENTOUS THAT CAN BEFALL A PUNY CHILD OF CLAY PERISH THE THOUGHT I
SHUDDER TO THINK OF THE FUTURE OF A RACE WHERE THE SEEDS OF SUCH MALICE
HAVE BEEN SOWN AND WHERE NO RIGHT REVERENCE IS RENDERED TO MOTHER AND
MAID IN HOUSE OF HORNE
HAVING DELIVERED HIMSELF OF THIS REBUKE HE
SALUTED THOSE PRESENT ON THE BY AND REPAIRED TO THE DOOR
A MURMUR
OF APPROVAL AROSE FROM ALL AND SOME WERE FOR EJECTING THE LOW SOAKER
WITHOUT MORE ADO A DESIGN WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTED NOR WOULD
HE HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN HIS BARE DESERTS HAD HE NOT ABRIDGED HIS
TRANSGRESSION BY AFFIRMING WITH A HORRID IMPRECATION FOR HE SWORE A
ROUND HAND THAT HE WAS AS GOOD A SON OF THE TRUE FOLD AS EVER DREW
BREATH
STAP MY VITALS SAID HE THEM WAS ALWAYS THE SENTIMENTS OF
HONEST FRANK COSTELLO WHICH I WAS BRED UP MOST PARTICULAR TO HONOUR THY
FATHER AND THY MOTHER THAT HAD THE BEST HAND TO A ROLYPOLY OR A HASTY
PUDDING AS YOU EVER SEE WHAT I ALWAYS LOOKS BACK ON WITH A LOVING HEART
TO REVERT TO MR BLOOM WHO AFTER HIS FIRST ENTRY HAD BEEN CONSCIOUS OF
SOME IMPUDENT MOCKS WHICH HE HOWEVER HAD BORNE WITH AS BEING THE FRUITS
OF THAT AGE UPON WHICH IT IS COMMONLY CHARGED THAT IT KNOWS NOT
PITY
THE YOUNG SPARKS IT IS TRUE WERE AS FULL OF EXTRAVAGANCIES
AS OVERGROWN CHILDREN THE WORDS OF THEIR TUMULTUARY DISCUSSIONS
WERE DIFFICULTLY UNDERSTOOD AND NOT OFTEN NICE THEIR TESTINESS AND
OUTRAGEOUS MOTS WERE SUCH THAT HIS INTELLECTS RESILED FROM NOR WERE
THEY SCRUPULOUSLY SENSIBLE OF THE PROPRIETIES THOUGH THEIR FUND OF
STRONG ANIMAL SPIRITS SPOKE IN THEIR BEHALF
BUT THE WORD OF MR COSTELLO
WAS AN UNWELCOME LANGUAGE FOR HIM FOR HE NAUSEATED THE WRETCH THAT
SEEMED TO HIM A CROPEARED CREATURE OF A MISSHAPEN GIBBOSITY BORN OUT
OF WEDLOCK AND THRUST LIKE A CROOKBACK TOOTHED AND FEET FIRST INTO THE
WORLD WHICH THE DINT OF THE SURGEON'S PLIERS IN HIS SKULL LENT INDEED
A COLOUR TO SO AS TO PUT HIM IN THOUGHT OF THAT MISSING LINK OF
CREATION'S CHAIN DESIDERATED BY THE LATE INGENIOUS MR DARWIN
IT WAS NOW
FOR MORE THAN THE MIDDLE SPAN OF OUR ALLOTTED YEARS THAT HE HAD PASSED
THROUGH THE THOUSAND VICISSITUDES OF EXISTENCE AND BEING OF A WARY
ASCENDANCY AND SELF A MAN OF RARE FORECAST HE HAD ENJOINED HIS HEART
TO REPRESS ALL MOTIONS OF A RISING CHOLER AND BY INTERCEPTING THEM
WITH THE READIEST PRECAUTION FOSTER WITHIN HIS BREAST THAT PLENITUDE
OF SUFFERANCE WHICH BASE MINDS JEER AT RASH JUDGERS SCORN AND ALL FIND
TOLERABLE AND BUT TOLERABLE
TO THOSE WHO CREATE THEMSELVES WITS AT THE
COST OF FEMININE DELICACY A HABIT OF MIND WHICH HE NEVER DID HOLD
WITH TO THEM HE WOULD CONCEDE NEITHER TO BEAR THE NAME NOR TO HERIT
THE TRADITION OF A PROPER BREEDING WHILE FOR SUCH THAT HAVING LOST
ALL FORBEARANCE CAN LOSE NO MORE THERE REMAINED THE SHARP ANTIDOTE OF
EXPERIENCE TO CAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY TO BEAT A PRECIPITATE AND INGLORIOUS
RETREAT
NOT BUT WHAT HE COULD FEEL WITH METTLESOME YOUTH WHICH CARING
NOUGHT FOR THE MOWS OF DOTARDS OR THE GRUNTLINGS OF THE SEVERE IS EVER
AS THE CHASTE FANCY OF THE HOLY WRITER EXPRESSES IT FOR EATING OF THE
TREE FORBID IT YET NOT SO FAR FORTH AS TO PRETERMIT HUMANITY UPON ANY
CONDITION SOEVER TOWARDS A GENTLEWOMAN WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT HER LAWFUL
OCCASIONS
TO CONCLUDE WHILE FROM THE SISTER'S WORDS HE HAD RECKONED
UPON A SPEEDY DELIVERY HE WAS HOWEVER IT MUST BE OWNED NOT A LITTLE
ALLEVIATED BY THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THE ISSUE SO AUSPICATED AFTER AN
ORDEAL OF SUCH DURESS NOW TESTIFIED ONCE MORE TO THE MERCY AS WELL AS TO
THE BOUNTY OF THE SUPREME BEING
ACCORDINGLY HE BROKE HIS MIND TO HIS NEIGHBOUR SAYING THAT TO EXPRESS
HIS NOTION OF THE THING HIS OPINION WHO OUGHT NOT PERCHANCE TO EXPRESS
ONE WAS THAT ONE MUST HAVE A COLD CONSTITUTION AND A FRIGID GENIUS NOT
TO BE REJOICED BY THIS FRESHEST NEWS OF THE FRUITION OF HER CONFINEMENT
SINCE SHE HAD BEEN IN SUCH PAIN THROUGH NO FAULT OF HERS
THE DRESSY
YOUNG BLADE SAID IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S THAT PUT HER IN THAT EXPECTATION
OR AT LEAST IT OUGHT TO BE UNLESS SHE WERE ANOTHER EPHESIAN MATRON
I
MUST ACQUAINT YOU SAID MR CROTTHERS CLAPPING ON THE TABLE SO AS TO
EVOKE A RESONANT COMMENT OF EMPHASIS OLD GLORY ALLELUJURUM WAS ROUND
AGAIN TODAY AN ELDERLY MAN WITH DUNDREARIES PREFERRING THROUGH HIS
NOSE A REQUEST TO HAVE WORD OF WILHELMINA MY LIFE AS HE CALLS HER
I
BADE HIM HOLD HIMSELF IN READINESS FOR THAT THE EVENT WOULD BURST ANON
'SLIFE I'LL BE ROUND WITH YOU
I CANNOT BUT EXTOL THE VIRILE POTENCY OF
THE OLD BUCKO THAT COULD STILL KNOCK ANOTHER CHILD OUT OF HER
ALL FELL
TO PRAISING OF IT EACH AFTER HIS OWN FASHION THOUGH THE SAME YOUNG
BLADE HELD WITH HIS FORMER VIEW THAT ANOTHER THAN HER CONJUGIAL HAD
BEEN THE MAN IN THE GAP A CLERK IN ORDERS A LINKBOY VIRTUOUS OR
AN ITINERANT VENDOR OF ARTICLES NEEDED IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD
SINGULAR
COMMUNED THE GUEST WITH HIMSELF THE WONDERFULLY UNEQUAL FACULTY OF
METEMPSYCHOSIS POSSESSED BY THEM THAT THE PUERPERAL DORMITORY AND THE
DISSECTING THEATRE SHOULD BE THE SEMINARIES OF SUCH FRIVOLITY THAT THE
MERE ACQUISITION OF ACADEMIC TITLES SHOULD SUFFICE TO TRANSFORM IN A
PINCH OF TIME THESE VOTARIES OF LEVITY INTO EXEMPLARY PRACTITIONERS OF
AN ART WHICH MOST MEN ANYWISE EMINENT HAVE ESTEEMED THE NOBLEST
BUT
HE FURTHER ADDED IT IS MAYHAP TO RELIEVE THE PENTUP FEELINGS THAT IN
COMMON OPPRESS THEM FOR I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE OBSERVED THAT BIRDS OF A
FEATHER LAUGH TOGETHER
BUT WITH WHAT FITNESS LET IT BE ASKED OF THE NOBLE LORD HIS PATRON
HAS THIS ALIEN WHOM THE CONCESSION OF A GRACIOUS PRINCE HAS ADMITTED
TO CIVIC RIGHTS CONSTITUTED HIMSELF THE LORD PARAMOUNT OF OUR
INTERNAL POLITY WHERE IS NOW THAT GRATITUDE WHICH LOYALTY SHOULD HAVE
COUNSELLED DURING THE RECENT WAR WHENEVER THE ENEMY HAD A TEMPORARY
ADVANTAGE WITH HIS GRANADOS DID THIS TRAITOR TO HIS KIND NOT SEIZE THAT
MOMENT TO DISCHARGE HIS PIECE AGAINST THE EMPIRE OF WHICH HE IS A TENANT
AT WILL WHILE HE TREMBLED FOR THE SECURITY OF HIS FOUR PER CENTS HAS HE
FORGOTTEN THIS AS HE FORGETS ALL BENEFITS RECEIVED OR IS IT THAT FROM
BEING A DELUDER OF OTHERS HE HAS BECOME AT LAST HIS OWN DUPE AS HE IS
IF REPORT BELIE HIM NOT HIS OWN AND HIS ONLY ENJOYER FAR BE IT FROM
CANDOUR TO VIOLATE THE BEDCHAMBER OF A RESPECTABLE LADY THE DAUGHTER OF
A GALLANT MAJOR OR TO CAST THE MOST DISTANT REFLECTIONS UPON HER
VIRTUE BUT IF HE CHALLENGES ATTENTION THERE AS IT WAS INDEED HIGHLY HIS
INTEREST NOT TO HAVE DONE THEN BE IT SO
UNHAPPY WOMAN SHE HAS BEEN
TOO LONG AND TOO PERSISTENTLY DENIED HER LEGITIMATE PREROGATIVE TO
LISTEN TO HIS OBJURGATIONS WITH ANY OTHER FEELING THAN THE DERISION OF
THE DESPERATE
HE SAYS THIS A CENSOR OF MORALS A VERY PELICAN IN HIS
PIETY WHO DID NOT SCRUPLE OBLIVIOUS OF THE TIES OF NATURE TO ATTEMPT
ILLICIT INTERCOURSE WITH A FEMALE DOMESTIC DRAWN FROM THE LOWEST STRATA
OF SOCIETY NAY HAD THE HUSSY'S SCOURINGBRUSH NOT BEEN HER TUTELARY
ANGEL IT HAD GONE WITH HER AS HARD AS WITH HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN IN THE
QUESTION OF THE GRAZING LANDS HIS PEEVISH ASPERITY IS NOTORIOUS AND IN
MR CUFFE'S HEARING BROUGHT UPON HIM FROM AN INDIGNANT RANCHER A SCATHING
RETORT COUCHED IN TERMS AS STRAIGHTFORWARD AS THEY WERE BUCOLIC
IT ILL
BECOMES HIM TO PREACH THAT GOSPEL
HAS HE NOT NEARER HOME A SEEDFIELD
THAT LIES FALLOW FOR THE WANT OF THE PLOUGHSHARE A HABIT REPREHENSIBLE
AT PUBERTY IS SECOND NATURE AND AN OPPROBRIUM IN MIDDLE LIFE
IF HE MUST
DISPENSE HIS BALM OF GILEAD IN NOSTRUMS AND APOTHEGMS OF DUBIOUS TASTE
TO RESTORE TO HEALTH A GENERATION OF UNFLEDGED PROFLIGATES LET HIS
PRACTICE CONSIST BETTER WITH THE DOCTRINES THAT NOW ENGROSS HIM
HIS
MARITAL BREAST IS THE REPOSITORY OF SECRETS WHICH DECORUM IS RELUCTANT
TO ADDUCE
THE LEWD SUGGESTIONS OF SOME FADED BEAUTY MAY CONSOLE HIM FOR
A CONSORT NEGLECTED AND DEBAUCHED BUT THIS NEW EXPONENT OF MORALS AND
HEALER OF ILLS IS AT HIS BEST AN EXOTIC TREE WHICH WHEN ROOTED IN
ITS NATIVE ORIENT THROVE AND FLOURISHED AND WAS ABUNDANT IN BALM
BUT TRANSPLANTED TO A CLIME MORE TEMPERATE ITS ROOTS HAVE LOST THEIR
QUONDAM VIGOUR WHILE THE STUFF THAT COMES AWAY FROM IT IS STAGNANT ACID
AND INOPERATIVE
THE NEWS WAS IMPARTED WITH A CIRCUMSPECTION RECALLING THE CEREMONIAL
USAGE OF THE SUBLIME PORTE BY THE SECOND FEMALE INFIRMARIAN TO THE
JUNIOR MEDICAL OFFICER IN RESIDENCE WHO IN HIS TURN ANNOUNCED TO THE
DELEGATION THAT AN HEIR HAD BEEN BORN WHEN HE HAD BETAKEN HIMSELF
TO THE WOMEN'S APARTMENT TO ASSIST AT THE PRESCRIBED CEREMONY OF THE
AFTERBIRTH IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMESTIC
AFFAIRS AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL SILENT IN UNANIMOUS
EXHAUSTION AND APPROBATION THE DELEGATES CHAFING UNDER THE LENGTH AND
SOLEMNITY OF THEIR VIGIL AND HOPING THAT THE JOYFUL OCCURRENCE WOULD
PALLIATE A LICENCE WHICH THE SIMULTANEOUS ABSENCE OF ABIGAIL AND
OBSTETRICIAN RENDERED THE EASIER BROKE OUT AT ONCE INTO A STRIFE OF
TONGUES
IN VAIN THE VOICE OF MR CANVASSER BLOOM WAS HEARD ENDEAVOURING
TO URGE TO MOLLIFY TO REFRAIN
THE MOMENT WAS TOO PROPITIOUS FOR THE
DISPLAY OF THAT DISCURSIVENESS WHICH SEEMED THE ONLY BOND OF UNION AMONG
TEMPERS SO DIVERGENT
EVERY PHASE OF THE SITUATION WAS SUCCESSIVELY
EVISCERATED THE PRENATAL REPUGNANCE OF UTERINE BROTHERS THE CAESAREAN
SECTION POSTHUMITY WITH RESPECT TO THE FATHER AND THAT RARER FORM
WITH RESPECT TO THE MOTHER THE FRATRICIDAL CASE KNOWN AS THE CHILDS

THE INJUNCTION UPON HER IN THE EVENT OF A YEARNING ARDENTLY AND

OF BRUTES HIS AUTHORITY BEING HIS OWN AVOUCHMENT IN SUPPORT OF FABLES
SUCH AS THAT OF THE MINOTAUR WHICH THE GENIUS OF THE ELEGANT LATIN POET
HAS HANDED DOWN TO US IN THE PAGES OF HIS METAMORPHOSES
THE IMPRESSION
MADE BY HIS WORDS WAS IMMEDIATE BUT SHORTLIVED
IT WAS EFFACED AS EASILY
AS IT HAD BEEN EVOKED BY AN ALLOCUTION FROM MR CANDIDATE MULLIGAN IN
THAT VEIN OF PLEASANTRY WHICH NONE BETTER THAN HE KNEW HOW TO AFFECT
POSTULATING AS THE SUPREMEST OBJECT OF DESIRE A NICE CLEAN OLD MAN

MADDEN HAD LOST FIVE DRACHMAS ON SCEPTRE FOR A WHIM OF THE
RIDER'S NAME LENEHAN AS MUCH MORE
HE TOLD THEM OF THE RACE
THE FLAG
FELL AND HUUH OFF SCAMPER THE MARE RAN OUT FRESHLY WITH 0
MADDEN
UP
SHE WAS LEADING THE FIELD
ALL HEARTS WERE BEATING
EVEN PHYLLIS
COULD NOT CONTAIN HERSELF
SHE WAVED HER SCARF AND CRIED HUZZAH
SCEPTRE WINS BUT IN THE STRAIGHT ON THE RUN HOME WHEN ALL WERE IN CLOSE
ORDER THE DARK HORSE THROWAWAY DREW LEVEL REACHED OUTSTRIPPED HER
ALL
WAS LOST NOW
PHYLLIS WAS SILENT HER EYES WERE SAD ANEMONES
JUNO SHE
CRIED I AM UNDONE
BUT HER LOVER CONSOLED HER AND BROUGHT HER A BRIGHT
CASKET OF GOLD IN WHICH LAY SOME OVAL SUGARPLUMS WHICH SHE PARTOOK
A
TEAR FELL ONE ONLY
A WHACKING FINE WHIP SAID LENEHAN IS W
LANE
FOUR WINNERS YESTERDAY AND THREE TODAY
WHAT RIDER IS LIKE HIM MOUNT
HIM ON THE CAMEL OR THE BOISTEROUS BUFFALO THE VICTORY IN A HACK CANTER
IS STILL HIS
BUT LET US BEAR IT AS WAS THE ANCIENT WONT
MERCY ON THE
LUCKLESS POOR SCEPTRE HE SAID WITH A LIGHT SIGH
SHE IS NOT THE FILLY
THAT SHE WAS
NEVER BY THIS HAND SHALL WE BEHOLD SUCH ANOTHER
BY GAD
SIR A QUEEN OF THEM
DO YOU REMEMBER HER VINCENT I WISH YOU COULD
HAVE SEEN MY QUEEN TODAY VINCENT SAID
HOW YOUNG SHE WAS AND RADIANT
LALAGE WERE SCARCE FAIR BESIDE HER IN HER YELLOW SHOES AND FROCK OF
MUSLIN I DO NOT KNOW THE RIGHT NAME OF IT
THE CHESTNUTS THAT SHADED
US WERE IN BLOOM THE AIR DROOPED WITH THEIR PERSUASIVE ODOUR AND WITH
POLLEN FLOATING BY US
IN THE SUNNY PATCHES ONE MIGHT EASILY HAVE
COOKED ON A STONE A BATCH OF THOSE BUNS WITH CORINTH FRUIT IN THEM THAT
PERIPLIPOMENES SELLS IN HIS BOOTH NEAR THE BRIDGE
BUT SHE HAD NOUGHT
FOR HER TEETH BUT THE ARM WITH WHICH I HELD HER AND IN THAT SHE NIBBLED
MISCHIEVOUSLY WHEN I PRESSED TOO CLOSE
A WEEK AGO SHE LAY ILL FOUR
DAYS ON THE COUCH BUT TODAY SHE WAS FREE BLITHE MOCKED AT PERIL
SHE IS MORE TAKING THEN
HER POSIES TOOL MAD ROMP THAT SHE IS SHE HAD
PULLED HER FILL AS WE RECLINED TOGETHER
AND IN YOUR EAR MY FRIEND YOU
WILL NOT THINK WHO MET US AS WE LEFT THE FIELD
CONMEE HIMSELF HE WAS
WALKING BY THE HEDGE READING I THINK A BREVIER BOOK WITH I DOUBT NOT
A WITTY LETTER IN IT FROM GLYCERA OR CHLOE TO KEEP THE PAGE
THE SWEET
CREATURE TURNED ALL COLOURS IN HER CONFUSION FEIGNING TO REPROVE A
SLIGHT DISORDER IN HER DRESS A SLIP OF UNDERWOOD CLUNG THERE FOR THE
VERY TREES ADORE HER
WHEN CONMEE HAD PASSED SHE GLANCED AT HER LOVELY
ECHO IN THAT LITTLE MIRROR SHE CARRIES
BUT HE HAD BEEN KIND
IN GOING
BY HE HAD BLESSED US
THE GODS TOO ARE EVER KIND LENEHAN SAID
IF I HAD
POOR LUCK WITH BASS'S MARE PERHAPS THIS DRAUGHT OF HIS MAY SERVE ME MORE
PROPENSELY
HE WAS LAYING HIS HAND UPON A WINEJAR MALACHI SAW IT AND
WITHHELD HIS ACT POINTING TO THE STRANGER AND TO THE SCARLET LABEL
WARILY MALACHI WHISPERED PRESERVE A DRUID SILENCE
HIS SOUL IS FAR
AWAY
IT IS AS PAINFUL PERHAPS TO BE AWAKENED FROM A VISION AS TO BE
BORN
ANY OBJECT INTENSELY REGARDED MAY BE A GATE OF ACCESS TO THE
INCORRUPTIBLE EON OF THE GODS
DO YOU NOT THINK IT STEPHEN THEOSOPHOS
TOLD ME SO STEPHEN ANSWERED WHOM IN A PREVIOUS EXISTENCE EGYPTIAN
PRIESTS INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF KARMIC LAW
THE LORDS OF THE
MOON THEOSOPHOS TOLD ME AN ORANGEFIERY SHIPLOAD FROM PLANET ALPHA
OF THE LUNAR CHAIN WOULD NOT ASSUME THE ETHERIC DOUBLES AND THESE
WERE THEREFORE INCARNATED BY THE RUBYCOLOURED EGOS FROM THE SECOND
CONSTELLATION
HOWEVER AS A MATTER OF FACT THOUGH THE PREPOSTEROUS SURMISE ABOUT HIM
BEING IN SOME DESCRIPTION OF A DOLDRUMS OR OTHER OR MESMERISED WHICH
WAS ENTIRELY DUE TO A MISCONCEPTION OF THE SHALLOWEST CHARACTER WAS
NOT THE CASE AT ALL
THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE VISUAL ORGANS WHILE THE ABOVE
WAS GOING ON WERE AT THIS JUNCTURE COMMENCING TO EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS OF
ANIMATION WAS AS ASTUTE IF NOT ASTUTER THAN ANY MAN LIVING AND ANYBODY
THAT CONJECTURED THE CONTRARY WOULD HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES PRETTY
SPEEDILY IN THE WRONG SHOP
DURING THE PAST FOUR MINUTES OR THEREABOUTS
HE HAD BEEN STARING HARD AT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NUMBER ONE BASS BOTTLED
BY MESSRS BASS AND CO AT BURTON ON TRENT WHICH HAPPENED TO BE SITUATED
AMONGST A LOT OF OTHERS RIGHT OPPOSITE TO WHERE HE WAS AND WHICH WAS
CERTAINLY CALCULATED TO ATTRACT ANYONE'S REMARK ON ACCOUNT OF ITS
SCARLET APPEARANCE
HE WAS SIMPLY AND SOLELY AS IT SUBSEQUENTLY
TRANSPIRED FOR REASONS BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF WHICH PUT QUITE AN
ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT COMPLEXION ON THE PROCEEDINGS AFTER THE MOMENT
BEFORE'S OBSERVATIONS ABOUT BOYHOOD DAYS AND THE TURF RECOLLECTING TWO
OR THREE PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS OF HIS OWN WHICH THE OTHER TWO WERE AS
MUTUALLY INNOCENT OF AS THE BABE UNBORN
EVENTUALLY HOWEVER BOTH
THEIR EYES MET AND AS SOON AS IT BEGAN TO DAWN ON HIM THAT THE OTHER WAS
ENDEAVOURING TO HELP HIMSELF TO THE THING HE INVOLUNTARILY DETERMINED
TO HELP HIM HIMSELF AND SO HE ACCORDINGLY TOOK HOLD OF THE NECK OF THE
MEDIUMSIZED GLASS RECIPIENT WHICH CONTAINED THE FLUID SOUGHT AFTER AND
MADE A CAPACIOUS HOLE IN IT BY POURING A LOT OF IT OUT WITH ALSO AT THE
SAME TIME HOWEVER A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF ATTENTIVENESS IN ORDER NOT
TO UPSET ANY OF THE BEER THAT WAS IN IT ABOUT THE PLACE
THE DEBATE WHICH ENSUED WAS IN ITS SCOPE AND PROGRESS AN EPITOME OF THE
COURSE OF LIFE
NEITHER PLACE NOR COUNCIL WAS LACKING IN DIGNITY
THE
DEBATERS WERE THE KEENEST IN THE LAND THE THEME THEY WERE ENGAGED ON
THE LOFTIEST AND MOST VITAL
THE HIGH HALL OF HORNE'S HOUSE HAD NEVER
BEHELD AN ASSEMBLY SO REPRESENTATIVE AND SO VARIED NOR HAD THE
OLD RAFTERS OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT EVER LISTENED TO A LANGUAGE SO
ENCYCLOPAEDIC
A GALLANT SCENE IN TRUTH IT MADE
CROTTHERS WAS THERE AT
THE FOOT OF THE TABLE IN HIS STRIKING HIGHLAND GARB HIS FACE GLOWING
FROM THE BRINY AIRS OF THE MULL OF GALLOWAY
THERE TOO OPPOSITE TO HIM
WAS LYNCH WHOSE COUNTENANCE BORE ALREADY THE STIGMATA OF EARLY DEPRAVITY
AND PREMATURE WISDOM
NEXT THE SCOTCHMAN WAS THE PLACE ASSIGNED TO
COSTELLO THE ECCENTRIC WHILE AT HIS SIDE WAS SEATED IN STOLID REPOSE
THE SQUAT FORM OF MADDEN
THE CHAIR OF THE RESIDENT INDEED STOOD VACANT
BEFORE THE HEARTH BUT ON EITHER FLANK OF IT THE FIGURE OF BANNON IN
EXPLORER'S KIT OF TWEED SHORTS AND SALTED COWHIDE BROGUES CONTRASTED
SHARPLY WITH THE PRIMROSE ELEGANCE AND TOWNBRED MANNERS OF MALACHI
ROLAND ST JOHN MULLIGAN
LASTLY AT THE HEAD OF THE BOARD WAS THE YOUNG
POET WHO FOUND A REFUGE FROM HIS LABOURS OF PEDAGOGY AND METAPHYSICAL
INQUISITION IN THE CONVIVIAL ATMOSPHERE OF SOCRATIC DISCUSSION WHILE
TO RIGHT AND LEFT OF HIM WERE ACCOMMODATED THE FLIPPANT PROGNOSTICATOR
FRESH FROM THE HIPPODROME AND THAT VIGILANT WANDERER SOILED BY THE
DUST OF TRAVEL AND COMBAT AND STAINED BY THE MIRE OF AN INDELIBLE
DISHONOUR BUT FROM WHOSE STEADFAST AND CONSTANT HEART NO LURE OR PERIL
OR THREAT OR DEGRADATION COULD EVER EFFACE THE IMAGE OF THAT VOLUPTUOUS
LOVELINESS WHICH THE INSPIRED PENCIL OF LAFAYETTE HAS LIMNED FOR AGES
YET TO COME
IT HAD BETTER BE STATED HERE AND NOW AT THE OUTSET THAT THE PERVERTED
TRANSCENDENTALISM TO WHICH MR S
DEDALUS' DIV
SCEP CONTENTIONS
WOULD APPEAR TO PROVE HIM PRETTY BADLY ADDICTED RUNS DIRECTLY COUNTER TO
ACCEPTED SCIENTIFIC METHODS
SCIENCE IT CANNOT BE TOO OFTEN REPEATED
DEALS WITH TANGIBLE PHENOMENA
THE MAN OF SCIENCE LIKE THE MAN IN THE
STREET HAS TO FACE HARDHEADED FACTS THAT CANNOT BE BLINKED AND EXPLAIN
THEM AS BEST HE CAN
THERE MAY BE IT IS TRUE SOME QUESTIONS WHICH
SCIENCE CANNOT ANSWER AT PRESENT SUCH AS THE FIRST PROBLEM SUBMITTED
BY MR L
BLOOM PUBB
CANV REGARDING THE FUTURE DETERMINATION OF SEX
MUST WE ACCEPT THE VIEW OF EMPEDOCLES OF TRINACRIA THAT THE RIGHT OVARY
THE POSTMENSTRUAL PERIOD ASSERT OTHERS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BIRTH
OF MALES OR ARE THE TOO LONG NEGLECTED SPERMATOZOA OR NEMASPERMS THE
DIFFERENTIATING FACTORS OR IS IT AS MOST EMBRYOLOGISTS INCLINE TO
OPINE SUCH AS CULPEPPER SPALLANZANI BLUMENBACH LUSK HERTWIG
LEOPOLD AND VALENTI A MIXTURE OF BOTH THIS WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO
A COOPERATION ONE OF NATURE'S FAVOURITE DEVICES BETWEEN THE NISUS
FORMATIVUS OF THE NEMASPERM ON THE ONE HAND AND ON THE OTHER A HAPPILY
CHOSEN POSITION SUCCUBITUS FELIX OF THE PASSIVE ELEMENT
THE OTHER
PROBLEM RAISED BY THE SAME INQUIRER IS SCARCELY LESS VITAL INFANT
MORTALITY
IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE AS HE PERTINENTLY REMARKS WE
ARE ALL BORN IN THE SAME WAY BUT WE ALL DIE IN DIFFERENT WAYS
MR M

DOC BLAMES THE SANITARY CONDITIONS IN WHICH
OUR GREYLUNGED CITIZENS CONTRACT ADENOIDS PULMONARY COMPLAINTS ETC
BY
INHALING THE BACTERIA WHICH LURK IN DUST
THESE FACTORS HE ALLEGED

POSTERS RELIGIOUS MINISTERS OF ALL DENOMINATIONS MUTILATED SOLDIERS
AND SAILORS EXPOSED SCORBUTIC CARDRIVERS THE SUSPENDED CARCASES OF
DEAD ANIMALS PARANOIC BACHELORS AND UNFRUCTIFIED DUENNAS THESE HE
SAID WERE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY AND EVERY FALLINGOFF IN THE CALIBRE OF
THE RACE
KALIPEDIA HE PROPHESIED WOULD SOON BE GENERALLY ADOPTED
AND ALL THE GRACES OF LIFE GENUINELY GOOD MUSIC AGREEABLE LITERATURE
LIGHT PHILOSOPHY INSTRUCTIVE PICTURES PLASTERCAST REPRODUCTIONS OF

MR J
CROTTHERS DISC
BACC ATTRIBUTES
SOME OF THESE DEMISES TO ABDOMINAL TRAUMA IN THE CASE OF WOMEN WORKERS
SUBJECTED TO HEAVY LABOURS IN THE WORKSHOP AND TO MARITAL DISCIPLINE IN
THE HOME BUT BY FAR THE VAST MAJORITY TO NEGLECT PRIVATE OR OFFICIAL
CULMINATING IN THE EXPOSURE OF NEWBORN INFANTS THE PRACTICE OF CRIMINAL
ABORTION OR IN THE ATROCIOUS CRIME OF INFANTICIDE
ALTHOUGH THE FORMER
WE ARE THINKING OF NEGLECT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONLY TOO TRUE THE CASE HE
CITES OF NURSES FORGETTING TO COUNT THE SPONGES IN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY
IS TOO RARE TO BE NORMATIVE
IN FACT WHEN ONE COMES TO LOOK INTO IT THE
WONDER IS THAT SO MANY PREGNANCIES AND DELIVERIES GO OFF SO WELL AS THEY
DO ALL THINGS CONSIDERED AND IN SPITE OF OUR HUMAN SHORTCOMINGS WHICH
OFTEN BAULK NATURE IN HER INTENTIONS
AN INGENIOUS SUGGESTION IS
THAT THROWN OUT BY MR V
LYNCH BACC
ARITH THAT BOTH NATALITY AND
MORTALITY AS WELL AS ALL OTHER PHENOMENA OF EVOLUTION TIDAL MOVEMENTS
LUNAR PHASES BLOOD TEMPERATURES DISEASES IN GENERAL EVERYTHING IN
FINE IN NATURE'S VAST WORKSHOP FROM THE EXTINCTION OF SOME REMOTE SUN
TO THE BLOSSOMING OF ONE OF THE COUNTLESS FLOWERS WHICH BEAUTIFY OUR
PUBLIC PARKS IS SUBJECT TO A LAW OF NUMERATION AS YET UNASCERTAINED
STILL THE PLAIN STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTION WHY A CHILD OF NORMALLY HEALTHY
PARENTS AND SEEMINGLY A HEALTHY CHILD AND PROPERLY LOOKED AFTER SUCCUMBS
UNACCOUNTABLY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD THOUGH OTHER CHILDREN OF THE SAME
MARRIAGE DO NOT MUST CERTAINLY IN THE POET'S WORDS GIVE US PAUSE
NATURE WE MAY REST ASSURED HAS HER OWN GOOD AND COGENT REASONS FOR
WHATEVER SHE DOES AND IN ALL PROBABILITY SUCH DEATHS ARE DUE TO SOME LAW
OF ANTICIPATION BY WHICH ORGANISMS IN WHICH MORBOUS GERMS HAVE TAKEN
UP THEIR RESIDENCE MODERN SCIENCE HAS CONCLUSIVELY SHOWN THAT ONLY THE
PLASMIC SUBSTANCE CAN BE SAID TO BE IMMORTAL TEND TO DISAPPEAR AT AN
INCREASINGLY EARLIER STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH THOUGH
PRODUCTIVE OF PAIN TO SOME OF OUR FEELINGS NOTABLY THE MATERNAL IS
NEVERTHELESS SOME OF US THINK IN THE LONG RUN BENEFICIAL TO THE
RACE IN GENERAL IN SECURING THEREBY THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST

EMBRYO PHILOSOPHER WHO FOR ALL HIS OVERWEENING BUMPTIOUSNESS IN THINGS
SCIENTIFIC CAN SCARCELY DISTINGUISH AN ACID FROM AN ALKALI PRIDES
HIMSELF ON BEING IT SHOULD PERHAPS BE STATED THAT STAGGERING BOB IN

MEANWHILE THE SKILL AND PATIENCE OF THE PHYSICIAN HAD BROUGHT ABOUT A

ALL THAT SURGICAL SKILL COULD DO WAS DONE AND THE BRAVE
WOMAN HAD MANFULLY HELPED

SHE HAD FOUGHT THE GOOD FIGHT AND
NOW SHE WAS VERY VERY HAPPY
THOSE WHO HAVE PASSED ON WHO HAVE GONE

REVERENTLY LOOK AT HER AS SHE RECLINES THERE WITH THE MOTHERLIGHT

HE MAY SUFFER THEIR MEMORY TO GROW DIM
LET THEM BE AS THOUGH THEY HAD NOT BEEN AND ALL BUT PERSUADE HIMSELF
THAT THEY WERE NOT OR AT LEAST WERE OTHERWISE
YET A CHANCE WORD WILL
CALL THEM FORTH SUDDENLY AND THEY WILL RISE UP TO CONFRONT HIM IN THE
MOST VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES A VISION OR A DREAM OR WHILE TIMBREL
AND HARP SOOTHE HIS SENSES OR AMID THE COOL SILVER TRANQUILITY OF THE
EVENING OR AT THE FEAST AT MIDNIGHT WHEN HE IS NOW FILLED WITH WINE
NOT TO INSULT OVER HIM WILL THE VISION COME AS OVER ONE THAT LIES UNDER
HER WRATH NOT FOR VENGEANCE TO CUT HIM OFF FROM THE LIVING BUT SHROUDED
IN THE PITEOUS VESTURE OF THE PAST SILENT REMOTE REPROACHFUL
THE STRANGER STILL REGARDED ON THE FACE BEFORE HIM A SLOW RECESSION OF
THAT FALSE CALM THERE IMPOSED AS IT SEEMED BY HABIT OR SOME STUDIED
TRICK UPON WORDS SO EMBITTERED AS TO ACCUSE IN THEIR SPEAKER AN

III
PREPARATORY TO ANYTHING ELSE MR BLOOM BRUSHED OFF THE GREATER BULK OF
THE SHAVINGS AND HANDED STEPHEN THE HAT AND ASHPLANT AND BUCKED HIM UP
GENERALLY IN ORTHODOX SAMARITAN FASHION WHICH HE VERY BADLY NEEDED
HIS
STEPHEN'S MIND WAS NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD CALL WANDERING BUT A BIT
UNSTEADY AND ON HIS EXPRESSED DESIRE FOR SOME BEVERAGE TO DRINK MR
BLOOM IN VIEW OF THE HOUR IT WAS AND THERE BEING NO PUMP OF VARTRY WATER
AVAILABLE FOR THEIR ABLUTIONS LET ALONE DRINKING PURPOSES HIT UPON AN
EXPEDIENT BY SUGGESTING OFF THE REEL THE PROPRIETY OF THE CABMAN'S
SHELTER AS IT WAS CALLED HARDLY A STONESTHROW AWAY NEAR BUTT BRIDGE
WHERE THEY MIGHT HIT UPON SOME DRINKABLES IN THE SHAPE OF A MILK AND
SODA OR A MINERAL
BUT HOW TO GET THERE WAS THE RUB
FOR THE NONCE HE
WAS RATHER NONPLUSSED BUT INASMUCH AS THE DUTY PLAINLY DEVOLVED UPON HIM
TO TAKE SOME MEASURES ON THE SUBJECT HE PONDERED SUITABLE WAYS AND MEANS
DURING WHICH STEPHEN REPEATEDLY YAWNED
SO FAR AS HE COULD SEE HE WAS
RATHER PALE IN THE FACE SO THAT IT OCCURRED TO HIM AS HIGHLY ADVISABLE
TO GET A CONVEYANCE OF SOME DESCRIPTION WHICH WOULD ANSWER IN THEIR
THEN CONDITION BOTH OF THEM BEING E D ED PARTICULARLY STEPHEN ALWAYS
ASSUMING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A THING TO BE FOUND
ACCORDINGLY AFTER A
FEW SUCH PRELIMINARIES AS BRUSHING IN SPITE OF HIS HAVING FORGOTTEN
TO TAKE UP HIS RATHER SOAPSUDDY HANDKERCHIEF AFTER IT HAD DONE YEOMAN
SERVICE IN THE SHAVING LINE THEY BOTH WALKED TOGETHER ALONG BEAVER
STREET OR MORE PROPERLY LANE AS FAR AS THE FARRIER'S AND THE
DISTINCTLY FETID ATMOSPHERE OF THE LIVERY STABLES AT THE CORNER OF
MONTGOMERY STREET WHERE THEY MADE TRACKS TO THE LEFT FROM THENCE
DEBOUCHING INTO AMIENS STREET ROUND BY THE CORNER OF DAN BERGIN'S
BUT
AS HE CONFIDENTLY ANTICIPATED THERE WAS NOT A SIGN OF A JEHU PLYING FOR
HIRE ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN EXCEPT A FOURWHEELER PROBABLY ENGAGED BY SOME
FELLOWS INSIDE ON THE SPREE OUTSIDE THE NORTH STAR HOTEL AND THERE WAS
NO SYMPTOM OF ITS BUDGING A QUARTER OF AN INCH WHEN MR BLOOM WHO WAS
ANYTHING BUT A PROFESSIONAL WHISTLER ENDEAVOURED TO HAIL IT BY EMITTING
A KIND OF A WHISTLE HOLDING HIS ARMS ARCHED OVER HIS HEAD TWICE
THIS WAS A QUANDARY BUT BRINGING COMMON SENSE TO BEAR ON IT EVIDENTLY
THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT PUT A GOOD FACE ON THE MATTER AND FOOT IT
WHICH THEY ACCORDINGLY DID
SO BEVELLING AROUND BY MULLETT'S AND THE
SIGNAL HOUSE WHICH THEY SHORTLY REACHED THEY PROCEEDED PERFORCE IN THE
DIRECTION OF AMIENS STREET RAILWAY TERMINUS MR BLOOM BEING HANDICAPPED
BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ONE OF THE BACK BUTTONS OF HIS TROUSERS HAD
TO VARY THE TIMEHONOURED ADAGE GONE THE WAY OF ALL BUTTONS THOUGH
ENTERING THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE THING HE HEROICALLY MADE
LIGHT OF THE MISCHANCE
SO AS NEITHER OF THEM WERE PARTICULARLY PRESSED
FOR TIME AS IT HAPPENED AND THE TEMPERATURE REFRESHING SINCE IT
CLEARED UP AFTER THE RECENT VISITATION OF JUPITER PLUVIUS THEY DANDERED
ALONG PAST BY WHERE THE EMPTY VEHICLE WAS WAITING WITHOUT A FARE OR A
JARVEY
AS IT SO HAPPENED A DUBLIN UNITED TRAMWAYS COMPANY'S SANDSTREWER
HAPPENED TO BE RETURNING AND THE ELDER MAN RECOUNTED TO HIS COMPANION
PROPOS OF THE INCIDENT HIS OWN TRULY MIRACULOUS ESCAPE OF SOME LITTLE
WHILE BACK
THEY PASSED THE MAIN ENTRANCE OF THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY
STATION THE STARTING POINT FOR BELFAST WHERE OF COURSE ALL TRAFFIC WAS
SUSPENDED AT THAT LATE HOUR AND PASSING THE BACKDOOR OF THE MORGUE
A NOT VERY ENTICING LOCALITY NOT TO SAY GRUESOME TO A DEGREE MORE
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT ULTIMATELY GAINED THE DOCK TAVERN AND IN DUE COURSE
TURNED INTO STORE STREET FAMOUS FOR ITS C DIVISION POLICE STATION
BETWEEN THIS POINT AND THE HIGH AT PRESENT UNLIT WAREHOUSES OF BERESFORD
PLACE STEPHEN THOUGHT TO THINK OF IBSEN ASSOCIATED WITH BAIRD'S THE
STONECUTTER'S IN HIS MIND SOMEHOW IN TALBOT PLACE FIRST TURNING ON THE
RIGHT WHILE THE OTHER WHO WAS ACTING AS HIS FIDUS ACHATES INHALED
WITH INTERNAL SATISFACTION THE SMELL OF JAMES ROURKE'S CITY BAKERY
SITUATED QUITE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WERE THE VERY PALATABLE ODOUR INDEED
OF OUR DAILY BREAD OF ALL COMMODITIES OF THE PUBLIC THE PRIMARY AND
MOST INDISPENSABLE
BREAD THE STAFF OF LIFE EARN YOUR BREAD O TELL ME
WHERE IS FANCY BREAD AT ROURKE'S THE BAKER'S IT IS SAID
EN ROUTE TO HIS TACITURN AND NOT TO PUT TOO FINE A POINT ON IT NOT
YET PERFECTLY SOBER COMPANION MR BLOOM WHO AT ALL EVENTS WAS IN COMPLETE
POSSESSION OF HIS FACULTIES NEVER MORE SO IN FACT DISGUSTINGLY SOBER
SPOKE A WORD OF CAUTION RE THE DANGERS OF NIGHTTOWN WOMEN OF ILL FAME
AND SWELL MOBSMEN WHICH BARELY PERMISSIBLE ONCE IN A WHILE THOUGH NOT
AS A HABITUAL PRACTICE WAS OF THE NATURE OF A REGULAR DEATHTRAP FOR
YOUNG FELLOWS OF HIS AGE PARTICULARLY IF THEY HAD ACQUIRED DRINKING
HABITS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIQUOR UNLESS YOU KNEW A LITTLE JIUJITSU
FOR EVERY CONTINGENCY AS EVEN A FELLOW ON THE BROAD OF HIS BACK COULD
ADMINISTER A NASTY KICK IF YOU DIDN'T LOOK OUT
HIGHLY PROVIDENTIAL
WAS THE APPEARANCE ON THE SCENE OF CORNY KELLEHER WHEN STEPHEN WAS
BLISSFULLY UNCONSCIOUS BUT FOR THAT MAN IN THE GAP TURNING UP AT THE
ELEVENTH HOUR THE FINIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A
CANDIDATE FOR THE ACCIDENT WARD OR FAILING THAT THE BRIDEWELL AND
AN APPEARANCE IN THE COURT NEXT DAY BEFORE MR TOBIAS OR HE BEING THE
SOLICITOR RATHER OLD WALL HE MEANT TO SAY OR MAHONY WHICH SIMPLY
SPELT RUIN FOR A CHAP WHEN IT GOT BRUITED ABOUT
THE REASON HE MENTIONED
THE FACT WAS THAT A LOT OF THOSE POLICEMEN WHOM HE CORDIALLY DISLIKED
WERE ADMITTEDLY UNSCRUPULOUS IN THE SERVICE OF THE CROWN AND AS MR
BLOOM PUT IT RECALLING A CASE OR TWO IN THE A DIVISION IN CLANBRASSIL
STREET PREPARED TO SWEAR A HOLE THROUGH A TEN GALLON POT
NEVER ON
THE SPOT WHEN WANTED BUT IN QUIET PARTS OF THE CITY PEMBROKE ROAD FOR
EXAMPLE THE
GUARDIANS OF THE LAW WERE WELL IN EVIDENCE THE OBVIOUS REASON BEING
THEY WERE PAID TO PROTECT THE UPPER CLASSES
ANOTHER THING HE COMMENTED
ON WAS EQUIPPING SOLDIERS WITH FIREARMS OR SIDEARMS OF ANY DESCRIPTION
LIABLE TO GO OFF AT ANY TIME WHICH WAS TANTAMOUNT TO INCITING THEM
AGAINST CIVILIANS SHOULD BY ANY CHANCE THEY FALL OUT OVER ANYTHING
YOU
FRITTERED AWAY YOUR TIME HE VERY SENSIBLY MAINTAINED AND HEALTH AND
ALSO CHARACTER BESIDES WHICH THE SQUANDERMANIA OF THE THING FAST WOMEN
OF THE DEMIMONDE RAN AWAY WITH A LOT OF L S
D
INTO THE BARGAIN AND
THE GREATEST DANGER OF ALL WAS WHO YOU GOT DRUNK WITH THOUGH TOUCHING
THE MUCH VEXED QUESTION OF STIMULANTS HE RELISHED A GLASS OF CHOICE OLD
WINE IN SEASON AS BOTH
NOURISHING AND BLOODMAKING AND POSSESSING APERIENT VIRTUES NOTABLY A
GOOD BURGUNDY WHICH HE WAS A STAUNCH BELIEVER IN STILL NEVER BEYOND
A CERTAIN POINT WHERE HE INVARIABLY DREW THE LINE AS IT SIMPLY LED TO
TROUBLE ALL ROUND TO SAY NOTHING OF YOUR BEING AT THE TENDER MERCY OF
OTHERS PRACTICALLY
MOST OF ALL HE COMMENTED ADVERSELY ON THE DESERTION
OF STEPHEN BY ALL HIS PUBHUNTING CONFRERES BUT ONE A MOST GLARING
PIECE OF RATTING ON THE PART OF HIS BROTHER MEDICOS UNDER ALL THE CIRCS
AND THAT ONE WAS JUDAS STEPHEN SAID WHO UP TO THEN HAD SAID NOTHING
WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND
DISCUSSING THESE AND KINDRED TOPICS THEY MADE A BEELINE ACROSS THE BACK
OF THE CUSTOMHOUSE AND PASSED UNDER THE LOOP LINE BRIDGE WHERE A BRAZIER
OF COKE BURNING IN FRONT OF A SENTRYBOX OR SOMETHING LIKE ONE ATTRACTED
THEIR RATHER LAGGING FOOTSTEPS
STEPHEN OF HIS OWN ACCORD STOPPED FOR
NO SPECIAL REASON TO LOOK AT THE HEAP OF BARREN COBBLESTONES AND BY
THE LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE BRAZIER HE COULD JUST MAKE OUT THE DARKER
FIGURE OF THE CORPORATION WATCHMAN INSIDE THE GLOOM OF THE SENTRYBOX
HE
BEGAN TO REMEMBER THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED OR HAD BEEN MENTIONED AS HAVING
HAPPENED BEFORE BUT IT COST HIM NO SMALL EFFORT BEFORE HE REMEMBERED
THAT HE RECOGNISED IN THE SENTRY A QUONDAM FRIEND OF HIS FATHER'S
GUMLEY
TO AVOID A MEETING HE DREW NEARER TO THE PILLARS OF THE RAILWAY
BRIDGE
SOMEONE SALUTED YOU MR BLOOM SAID
A FIGURE OF MIDDLE HEIGHT ON THE PROWL EVIDENTLY UNDER THE ARCHES
SALUTED AGAIN CALLING
NIGHT
STEPHEN OF COURSE STARTED RATHER DIZZILY AND STOPPED TO RETURN THE
COMPLIMENT
MR BLOOM ACTUATED BY MOTIVES OF INHERENT DELICACY INASMUCH
AS HE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS MOVED OFF BUT
NEVERTHELESS REMAINED ON THE QUI VIVE WITH JUST A SHADE OF ANXIETY
THOUGH NOT FUNKYISH IN THE LEAST
THOUGH UNUSUAL IN THE DUBLIN AREA HE
KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS UNKNOWN FOR DESPERADOES WHO HAD NEXT
TO NOTHING TO LIVE ON TO BE ABROAD WAYLAYING AND GENERALLY TERRORISING
PEACEABLE PEDESTRIANS BY PLACING A PISTOL AT THEIR HEAD IN SOME
SECLUDED SPOT OUTSIDE THE CITY PROPER FAMISHED LOITERERS OF THE
THAMES EMBANKMENT CATEGORY THEY MIGHT BE HANGING ABOUT THERE OR SIMPLY
MARAUDERS READY TO DECAMP WITH WHATEVER BOODLE THEY COULD IN ONE FELL
SWOOP AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE LEAVING YOU THERE
TO POINT A MORAL GAGGED AND GARROTTED
STEPHEN THAT IS WHEN THE ACCOSTING FIGURE CAME TO CLOSE QUARTERS
THOUGH HE WAS NOT IN AN OVER SOBER STATE HIMSELF RECOGNISED CORLEY'S
BREATH REDOLENT OF ROTTEN CORNJUICE
LORD JOHN CORLEY SOME CALLED HIM
AND HIS GENEALOGY CAME ABOUT IN THIS WISE
HE WAS THE ELDEST SON OF
INSPECTOR CORLEY OF THE G DIVISION LATELY DECEASED WHO HAD MARRIED
A CERTAIN KATHERINE BROPHY THE DAUGHTER OF A LOUTH FARMER
HIS
GRANDFATHER PATRICK MICHAEL CORLEY OF NEW ROSS HAD MARRIED THE WIDOW
OF A PUBLICAN THERE WHOSE MAIDEN NAME HAD BEEN KATHERINE ALSO TALBOT
RUMOUR HAD IT THOUGH NOT PROVED THAT SHE DESCENDED FROM THE HOUSE OF
THE LORDS TALBOT DE MALAHIDE IN WHOSE MANSION REALLY AN UNQUESTIONABLY
FINE RESIDENCE OF ITS KIND AND WELL WORTH SEEING HER MOTHER OR AUNT OR
SOME RELATIVE A WOMAN AS THE TALE WENT OF EXTREME BEAUTY HAD ENJOYED
THE DISTINCTION OF BEING IN SERVICE IN THE WASHKITCHEN
THIS THEREFORE
WAS THE REASON WHY THE STILL COMPARATIVELY YOUNG THOUGH DISSOLUTE
MAN WHO NOW ADDRESSED STEPHEN WAS SPOKEN OF BY SOME WITH FACETIOUS
PROCLIVITIES AS LORD JOHN CORLEY
TAKING STEPHEN ON ONE SIDE HE HAD THE CUSTOMARY DOLEFUL DITTY TO TELL
NOT AS MUCH AS A FARTHING TO PURCHASE A NIGHT'S LODGINGS
HIS FRIENDS
HAD ALL DESERTED HIM
FURTHERMORE HE HAD A ROW WITH LENEHAN AND CALLED
HIM TO STEPHEN A MEAN BLOODY SWAB WITH A SPRINKLING OF A NUMBER OF OTHER
UNCALLEDFOR EXPRESSIONS
HE WAS OUT OF A JOB AND IMPLORED OF STEPHEN TO
TELL HIM WHERE ON GOD'S EARTH HE COULD GET SOMETHING ANYTHING AT ALL
TO DO
NO IT WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE MOTHER IN THE WASHKITCHEN THAT
WAS FOSTERSISTER TO THE HEIR OF THE HOUSE OR ELSE THEY WERE CONNECTED
THROUGH THE MOTHER IN SOME WAY BOTH OCCURRENCES HAPPENING AT THE SAME
TIME IF THE WHOLE THING WASN'T A COMPLETE FABRICATION FROM START TO
FINISH
ANYHOW HE WAS ALL IN
I WOULDN'T ASK YOU ONLY PURSUED HE ON MY SOLEMN OATH AND GOD KNOWS
I'M ON THE ROCKS
THERE'LL BE A JOB TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY STEPHEN TOLD HIM IN A BOYS'
SCHOOL AT DALKEY FOR A GENTLEMAN USHER
MR GARRETT DEASY
TRY IT
YOU
MAY MENTION MY NAME
AH GOD CORLEY REPLIED SURE I COULDN'T TEACH IN A SCHOOL MAN
I WAS
NEVER ONE OF YOUR BRIGHT ONES HE ADDED WITH A HALF LAUGH
I GOT STUCK
TWICE IN THE JUNIOR AT THE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS
I HAVE NO PLACE TO SLEEP MYSELF STEPHEN INFORMED HIM
CORLEY AT THE FIRST GO OFF WAS INCLINED TO SUSPECT IT WAS SOMETHING TO
DO WITH STEPHEN BEING FIRED OUT OF HIS DIGS FOR BRINGING IN A BLOODY
TART OFF THE STREET
THERE WAS A DOSSHOUSE IN MARLBOROUGH STREET MRS
MALONEY'S BUT IT WAS ONLY A TANNER TOUCH AND FULL OF UNDESIRABLES BUT
M'CONACHIE TOLD HIM YOU GOT A DECENT ENOUGH DO IN THE BRAZEN HEAD OVER
IN WINETAVERN STREET WHICH WAS DISTANTLY SUGGESTIVE TO THE PERSON
ADDRESSED OF FRIAR BACON FOR A BOB
HE WAS STARVING TOO THOUGH HE
HADN'T SAID A WORD ABOUT IT
THOUGH THIS SORT OF THING WENT ON EVERY OTHER NIGHT OR VERY NEAR IT
STILL STEPHEN'S FEELINGS GOT THE BETTER OF HIM IN A SENSE THOUGH HE KNEW
THAT CORLEY'S BRANDNEW RIGMAROLE ON A PAR WITH THE OTHERS WAS HARDLY
DESERVING OF MUCH CREDENCE
HOWEVER HAUD IGNARUS MALORUM MISERIS
SUCCURRERE DISCO ETCETERA AS THE LATIN POET REMARKS ESPECIALLY AS LUCK
WOULD HAVE IT HE GOT PAID HIS SCREW AFTER EVERY MIDDLE OF THE MONTH ON
THE SIXTEENTH WHICH WAS THE DATE OF THE MONTH AS A MATTER OF FACT THOUGH
A GOOD BIT OF THE WHEREWITHAL WAS DEMOLISHED
BUT THE CREAM OF THE JOKE
WAS NOTHING WOULD GET IT OUT OF CORLEY'S HEAD THAT HE WAS LIVING IN
AFFLUENCE AND HADN'T A THING TO DO BUT HAND OUT THE NEEDFUL
WHEREAS
HE PUT HIS HAND IN A POCKET ANYHOW NOT WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING ANY FOOD
THERE BUT THINKING HE MIGHT LEND HIM ANYTHING UP TO A BOB OR SO IN LIEU
SO THAT HE MIGHT ENDEAVOUR AT ALL EVENTS AND GET SUFFICIENT TO EAT BUT
THE RESULT WAS IN THE NEGATIVE FOR TO HIS CHAGRIN HE FOUND HIS CASH
MISSING
A FEW BROKEN BISCUITS WERE ALL THE RESULT OF HIS INVESTIGATION
HE TRIED HIS HARDEST TO RECOLLECT FOR THE MOMENT WHETHER HE HAD LOST
AS WELL HE MIGHT HAVE OR LEFT BECAUSE IN THAT CONTINGENCY IT WAS NOT A
PLEASANT LOOKOUT VERY MUCH THE REVERSE IN FACT
HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO
FAGGED OUT TO INSTITUTE A THOROUGH SEARCH THOUGH HE TRIED TO RECOLLECT
ABOUT BISCUITS HE DIMLY REMEMBERED
WHO NOW EXACTLY GAVE THEM HE
WONDERED OR WHERE WAS OR DID HE BUY
HOWEVER IN ANOTHER POCKET HE CAME
ACROSS WHAT HE SURMISED IN THE DARK WERE PENNIES ERRONEOUSLY HOWEVER
AS IT TURNED OUT
THOSE ARE HALFCROWNS MAN CORLEY CORRECTED HIM
AND SO IN POINT OF FACT THEY TURNED OUT TO BE
STEPHEN ANYHOW LENT HIM
ONE OF THEM
THANKS CORLEY ANSWERED YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN
I'LL PAY YOU BACK ONE
TIME
WHO'S THAT WITH YOU I SAW HIM A FEW TIMES IN THE BLEEDING HORSE
IN CAMDEN STREET WITH BOYLAN THE BILLSTICKER
YOU MIGHT PUT IN A GOOD
WORD FOR US TO GET ME TAKEN ON THERE
I'D CARRY A SANDWICHBOARD ONLY
THE GIRL IN THE OFFICE TOLD ME THEY'RE FULL UP FOR THE NEXT THREE WEEKS
MAN
GOD YOU'VE TO BOOK AHEAD MAN YOU'D THINK IT WAS FOR THE CARL
ROSA
I DON'T GIVE A SHITE ANYWAY SO LONG AS I GET A JOB EVEN AS A
CROSSING SWEEPER
SUBSEQUENTLY BEING NOT QUITE SO DOWN IN THE MOUTH AFTER THE TWO AND SIX
HE GOT HE INFORMED STEPHEN ABOUT A FELLOW BY THE NAME OF BAGS COMISKY
THAT HE SAID STEPHEN KNEW WELL OUT OF FULLAM'S THE SHIPCHANDLER'S
BOOKKEEPER THERE THAT USED TO BE OFTEN ROUND IN NAGLE'S BACK WITH O'MARA
AND A LITTLE CHAP WITH A STUTTER THE NAME OF TIGHE
ANYHOW HE WAS LAGGED
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST AND FINED TEN BOB FOR A DRUNK AND DISORDERLY AND
REFUSING TO GO WITH THE CONSTABLE
210
MR BLOOM IN THE MEANWHILE KEPT DODGING ABOUT IN THE VICINITY OF THE
COBBLESTONES NEAR THE BRAZIER OF COKE IN FRONT OF THE CORPORATION
WATCHMAN'S SENTRYBOX WHO EVIDENTLY A GLUTTON FOR WORK IT STRUCK HIM
WAS HAVING A QUIET FORTY WINKS FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES ON HIS OWN
PRIVATE ACCOUNT WHILE DUBLIN SLEPT
HE THREW AN ODD EYE AT THE SAME TIME
NOW AND THEN AT STEPHEN'S ANYTHING BUT IMMACULATELY ATTIRED INTERLOCUTOR
AS IF HE HAD SEEN THAT NOBLEMAN SOMEWHERE OR OTHER THOUGH WHERE HE WAS
NOT IN A POSITION TO TRUTHFULLY STATE NOR HAD HE THE REMOTEST IDEA WHEN
BEING A LEVELHEADED INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD GIVE POINTS TO NOT A FEW IN
POINT OF SHREWD OBSERVATION HE ALSO REMARKED ON HIS VERY DILAPIDATED
HAT AND SLOUCHY WEARING APPAREL GENERALLY TESTIFYING TO A CHRONIC
IMPECUNIOSITY
PALPABLY HE WAS ONE OF HIS HANGERSON BUT FOR THE
MATTER OF THAT IT WAS MERELY A QUESTION OF ONE PREYING ON HIS NEXTDOOR
NEIGHBOUR ALL ROUND IN EVERY DEEP SO TO PUT IT A DEEPER DEPTH AND FOR
THE MATTER OF THAT IF THE MAN IN THE STREET CHANCED TO BE IN THE DOCK
HIMSELF PENAL SERVITUDE WITH OR WITHOUT THE OPTION OF A FINE WOULD BE
A VERY RARA AVIS ALTOGETHER
IN ANY CASE HE HAD A CONSUMMATE AMOUNT OF
COOL ASSURANCE INTERCEPTING PEOPLE AT THAT HOUR OF THE NIGHT OR MORNING
PRETTY THICK THAT WAS CERTAINLY
THE PAIR PARTED COMPANY AND STEPHEN REJOINED MR BLOOM WHO WITH HIS
PRACTISED EYE WAS NOT WITHOUT PERCEIVING THAT HE HAD SUCCUMBED TO THE
BLANDILOQUENCE OF THE OTHER PARASITE
ALLUDING TO THE ENCOUNTER HE SAID
LAUGHINGLY STEPHEN THAT IS
HE IS DOWN ON HIS LUCK
HE ASKED ME TO ASK YOU TO ASK SOMEBODY NAMED
BOYLAN A BILLSTICKER TO GIVE HIM A JOB AS A SANDWICHMAN
AT THIS INTELLIGENCE IN WHICH HE SEEMINGLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST MR
BLOOM GAZED ABSTRACTEDLY FOR THE SPACE OF A HALF A SECOND OR SO IN THE
DIRECTION OF A BUCKETDREDGER REJOICING IN THE FARFAMED NAME OF EBLANA
MOORED ALONGSIDE CUSTOMHOUSE QUAY AND QUITE POSSIBLY OUT OF REPAIR
WHEREUPON HE OBSERVED EVASIVELY
EVERYBODY GETS THEIR OWN RATION OF LUCK THEY SAY
NOW YOU MENTION IT
HIS FACE WAS FAMILIAR TO ME
BUT LEAVING THAT FOR THE MOMENT HOW MUCH
DID YOU PART WITH HE QUERIED IF I AM NOT TOO INQUISITIVE
HALF A CROWN STEPHEN RESPONDED
I DARESAY HE NEEDS IT TO SLEEP
SOMEWHERE
NEEDS MR BLOOM EJACULATED PROFESSING NOT THE LEAST SURPRISE AT
THE INTELLIGENCE I CAN QUITE CREDIT THE ASSERTION AND I GUARANTEE HE
INVARIABLY DOES
EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS NEEDS OR EVERYONE ACCORDING
TO HIS DEEDS
BUT TALKING ABOUT THINGS IN GENERAL WHERE ADDED HE WITH
A SMILE WILL YOU SLEEP YOURSELF WALKING TO SANDYCOVE IS OUT OF
THE QUESTION
AND EVEN SUPPOSING YOU DID YOU WON'T GET IN AFTER WHAT
OCCURRED AT WESTLAND ROW STATION
SIMPLY FAG OUT THERE FOR NOTHING
I
DON'T MEAN TO PRESUME TO DICTATE TO YOU IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT WHY
DID YOU LEAVE YOUR FATHER'S HOUSE
TO SEEK MISFORTUNE WAS STEPHEN'S ANSWER
I MET YOUR RESPECTED FATHER ON A RECENT OCCASION MR BLOOM
DIPLOMATICALLY RETURNED TODAY IN FACT OR TO BE STRICTLY ACCURATE ON
YESTERDAY
WHERE DOES HE LIVE AT PRESENT I GATHERED IN THE COURSE OF
CONVERSATION THAT HE HAD MOVED
I BELIEVE HE IS IN DUBLIN SOMEWHERE STEPHEN ANSWERED UNCONCERNEDLY
WHY
A GIFTED MAN MR BLOOM SAID OF MR DEDALUS SENIOR IN MORE RESPECTS
THAN ONE AND A BORN RACONTEUR IF EVER THERE WAS ONE
HE TAKES GREAT
PRIDE QUITE LEGITIMATE OUT OF YOU
YOU COULD GO BACK PERHAPS HE
HASARDED STILL THINKING OF THE VERY UNPLEASANT SCENE AT WESTLAND ROW
TERMINUS WHEN IT WAS PERFECTLY EVIDENT THAT THE OTHER TWO MULLIGAN
THAT IS AND THAT ENGLISH TOURIST FRIEND OF HIS WHO EVENTUALLY EUCHRED
THEIR THIRD COMPANION WERE PATENTLY TRYING AS IF THE WHOLE BALLY
STATION BELONGED TO THEM TO GIVE STEPHEN THE SLIP IN THE CONFUSION
WHICH THEY DID
THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FORTHCOMING TO THE SUGGESTION HOWEVER SUCH AS IT
WAS STEPHEN'S MIND'S EYE BEING TOO BUSILY ENGAGED IN REPICTURING HIS
FAMILY HEARTH THE LAST TIME HE SAW IT WITH HIS SISTER DILLY SITTING BY
THE INGLE HER HAIR HANGING DOWN WAITING FOR SOME WEAK TRINIDAD SHELL
COCOA THAT WAS IN THE SOOTCOATED KETTLE TO BE DONE SO THAT SHE AND HE
COULD DRINK IT WITH THE OATMEALWATER FOR MILK AFTER THE FRIDAY HERRINGS
THEY HAD EATEN AT TWO A PENNY WITH AN EGG APIECE FOR MAGGY BOODY AND
KATEY THE CAT MEANWHILE UNDER THE MANGLE DEVOURING A MESS OF EGGSHELLS
AND CHARRED FISH HEADS AND BONES ON A SQUARE OF BROWN PAPER IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE THIRD PRECEPT OF THE CHURCH TO FAST AND ABSTAIN
ON THE DAYS COMMANDED IT BEING QUARTER TENSE OR IF NOT EMBER DAYS OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
NO MR BLOOM REPEATED AGAIN I WOULDN'T PERSONALLY REPOSE MUCH TRUST
IN THAT BOON COMPANION OF YOURS WHO CONTRIBUTES THE HUMOROUS ELEMENT DR
MULLIGAN AS A GUIDE PHILOSOPHER AND FRIEND IF I WERE IN YOUR SHOES
HE
KNOWS WHICH SIDE HIS BREAD IS BUTTERED ON THOUGH IN ALL PROBABILITY HE
NEVER REALISED WHAT IT IS TO BE WITHOUT REGULAR MEALS
OF COURSE YOU
DIDN'T NOTICE AS MUCH AS I DID
BUT IT WOULDN'T OCCASION ME THE LEAST
SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT A PINCH OF TOBACCO OR SOME NARCOTIC WAS PUT IN
YOUR DRINK FOR SOME ULTERIOR OBJECT
HE UNDERSTOOD HOWEVER FROM ALL HE HEARD THAT DR MULLIGAN WAS A VERSATILE
ALLROUND MAN BY NO MEANS CONFINED TO MEDICINE ONLY WHO WAS RAPIDLY
COMING TO THE FORE IN HIS LINE AND IF THE REPORT WAS VERIFIED BADE
FAIR TO ENJOY A FLOURISHING PRACTICE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE AS
A TONY MEDICAL PRACTITIONER DRAWING A HANDSOME FEE FOR HIS SERVICES
IN ADDITION TO WHICH PROFESSIONAL STATUS HIS RESCUE OF THAT MAN FROM
CERTAIN DROWNING BY ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION AND WHAT THEY CALL FIRST
AID AT SKERRIES OR MALAHIDE WAS IT WAS HE WAS BOUND TO ADMIT AN
EXCEEDINGLY PLUCKY DEED WHICH HE COULD NOT TOO HIGHLY PRAISE SO THAT
FRANKLY HE WAS UTTERLY AT A LOSS TO FATHOM WHAT EARTHLY REASON COULD BE
AT THE BACK OF IT EXCEPT HE PUT IT DOWN TO SHEER CUSSEDNESS OR JEALOUSY
PURE AND SIMPLE
EXCEPT IT SIMPLY AMOUNTS TO ONE THING AND HE IS WHAT THEY CALL PICKING
YOUR BRAINS HE VENTURED TO THROW OUT
THE GUARDED GLANCE OF HALF SOLICITUDE HALF CURIOSITY AUGMENTED BY
FRIENDLINESS WHICH HE GAVE AT STEPHEN'S AT PRESENT MOROSE EXPRESSION
OF FEATURES DID NOT THROW A FLOOD OF LIGHT NONE AT ALL IN FACT ON THE
PROBLEM AS TO WHETHER HE HAD LET HIMSELF BE BADLY BAMBOOZLED TO JUDGE BY
TWO OR THREE LOWSPIRITED REMARKS HE LET DROP OR THE OTHER WAY ABOUT SAW
THROUGH THE AFFAIR AND FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF
ALLOWED MATTERS TO MORE OR LESS
GRINDING POVERTY DID HAVE THAT EFFECT
AND HE MORE THAN CONJECTURED THAT HIGH EDUCATIONAL ABILITIES THOUGH HE
POSSESSED HE EXPERIENCED NO LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN MAKING BOTH ENDS MEET
ADJACENT TO THE MEN'S PUBLIC URINAL THEY PERCEIVED AN ICECREAM CAR ROUND
WHICH A GROUP OF PRESUMABLY ITALIANS IN HEATED ALTERCATION WERE GETTING
RID OF VOLUBLE EXPRESSIONS IN THEIR VIVACIOUS LANGUAGE IN A PARTICULARLY
ANIMATED WAY THERE BEING SOME LITTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PARTIES
PUTTANA MADONNA CHE CI DIA I QUATTRINI HO RAGIONE CULO ROTTO
INTENDIAMOCI
MEZZO SOVRANO PIU
DICE LUI PERO
MEZZO
FARABUTTO MORTACCI SUI
MA ASCOLTA CINQUE LA TESTA PIU
MR BLOOM AND STEPHEN ENTERED THE CABMAN'S SHELTER AN UNPRETENTIOUS
WOODEN STRUCTURE WHERE PRIOR TO THEN HE HAD RARELY IF EVER BEEN
BEFORE THE FORMER HAVING PREVIOUSLY WHISPERED TO THE LATTER A FEW
HINTS ANENT THE KEEPER OF IT SAID TO BE THE ONCE FAMOUS SKIN THE GOAT
FITZHARRIS THE INVINCIBLE THOUGH HE COULD NOT VOUCH FOR THE ACTUAL
FACTS WHICH QUITE POSSIBLY THERE WAS NOT ONE VESTIGE OF TRUTH IN
A FEW
MOMENTS LATER SAW OUR TWO NOCTAMBULES SAFELY SEATED IN A DISCREET CORNER
ONLY TO BE GREETED BY STARES FROM THE DECIDEDLY MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTION
OF WAIFS AND STRAYS AND OTHER NONDESCRIPT SPECIMENS OF THE GENUS HOMO
ALREADY THERE ENGAGED IN EATING AND DRINKING DIVERSIFIED BY CONVERSATION
FOR WHOM THEY SEEMINGLY FORMED AN OBJECT OF MARKED CURIOSITY
NOW TOUCHING A CUP OF COFFEE MR BLOOM VENTURED TO PLAUSIBLY SUGGEST
TO BREAK THE ICE IT OCCURS TO ME YOU OUGHT TO SAMPLE SOMETHING IN THE
SHAPE OF SOLID FOOD SAY A ROLL OF SOME DESCRIPTION
ACCORDINGLY HIS FIRST ACT WAS WITH CHARACTERISTIC SANGFROID TO ORDER
THESE COMMODITIES QUIETLY
THE HOI POLLOI OF JARVIES OR STEVEDORES
OR WHATEVER THEY WERE AFTER A CURSORY EXAMINATION TURNED THEIR EYES
APPARENTLY DISSATISFIED AWAY THOUGH ONE REDBEARDED BIBULOUS INDIVIDUAL
PORTION OF WHOSE HAIR WAS GREYISH A SAILOR PROBABLY STILL STARED FOR
SOME APPRECIABLE TIME BEFORE TRANSFERRING HIS RAPT ATTENTION TO THE
FLOOR
MR BLOOM AVAILING HIMSELF OF THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH HE HAVING
JUST A BOWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LANGUAGE IN DISPUTE THOUGH TO BE
SURE RATHER IN A QUANDARY OVER VOGLIO REMARKED TO HIS PROTG IN
AN AUDIBLE TONE OF VOICE A PROPOS OF THE BATTLE ROYAL IN THE STREET
WHICH WAS STILL RAGING FAST AND FURIOUS
A BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE
I MEAN FOR SINGING PURPOSES
WHY DO YOU NOT
WRITE YOUR POETRY IN THAT LANGUAGE BELLA POETRIA IT IS SO MELODIOUS
AND FULL
BELLADONNA
VOGLIO
STEPHEN WHO WAS TRYING HIS DEAD BEST TO YAWN IF HE COULD SUFFERING
FROM LASSITUDE GENERALLY REPLIED
TO FILL THE EAR OF A COW ELEPHANT
THEY WERE HAGGLING OVER MONEY
IS THAT SO MR BLOOM ASKED
OF COURSE HE SUBJOINED PENSIVELY AT THE
INWARD REFLECTION OF THERE BEING MORE LANGUAGES TO START WITH THAN WERE
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IT MAY BE ONLY THE SOUTHERN GLAMOUR THAT SURROUNDS
IT
THE KEEPER OF THE SHELTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS TTE TTE PUT A
BOILING SWIMMING CUP OF A CHOICE CONCOCTION LABELLED COFFEE ON THE TABLE
AND A RATHER ANTEDILUVIAN SPECIMEN OF A BUN OR SO IT SEEMED
AFTER
WHICH HE BEAT A RETREAT TO HIS COUNTER MR BLOOM DETERMINING TO HAVE
A GOOD SQUARE LOOK AT HIM LATER ON SO AS NOT TO APPEAR TO
FOR WHICH
REASON HE ENCOURAGED STEPHEN TO PROCEED WITH HIS EYES WHILE HE DID
THE HONOURS BY SURREPTITIOUSLY PUSHING THE CUP OF WHAT WAS TEMPORARILY
SUPPOSED TO BE CALLED COFFEE GRADUALLY NEARER HIM
SOUNDS ARE IMPOSTURES STEPHEN SAID AFTER A PAUSE OF SOME LITTLE TIME
LIKE NAMES
CICERO PODMORE
NAPOLEON MR GOODBODY
JESUS MR DOYLE
SHAKESPEARES WERE AS COMMON AS MURPHIES
WHAT'S IN A NAME
YES TO BE SURE MR BLOOM UNAFFECTEDLY CONCURRED
OF COURSE
OUR NAME
WAS CHANGED TOO HE ADDED PUSHING THE SOCALLED ROLL ACROSS
THE REDBEARDED SAILOR WHO HAD HIS WEATHER EYE ON THE NEWCOMERS BOARDED
STEPHEN WHOM HE HAD SINGLED OUT FOR ATTENTION IN PARTICULAR SQUARELY
BY ASKING
AND WHAT MIGHT YOUR NAME BE
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME MR BLOOM TOUCHED HIS COMPANION'S BOOT BUT
STEPHEN APPARENTLY DISREGARDING THE WARM PRESSURE FROM AN UNEXPECTED
QUARTER ANSWERED
DEDALUS
THE SAILOR STARED AT HIM HEAVILY FROM A PAIR OF DROWSY BAGGY EYES
RATHER BUNGED UP FROM EXCESSIVE USE OF BOOSE PREFERABLY GOOD OLD
HOLLANDS AND WATER
YOU KNOW SIMON DEDALUS HE ASKED AT LENGTH
I'VE HEARD OF HIM STEPHEN SAID
MR BLOOM WAS ALL AT SEA FOR A MOMENT SEEING THE OTHERS EVIDENTLY
EAVESDROPPING TOO
HE'S IRISH THE SEAMAN BOLD AFFIRMED STARING STILL IN MUCH THE SAME
WAY AND NODDING
ALL IRISH
ALL TOO IRISH STEPHEN REJOINED
AS FOR MR BLOOM HE COULD NEITHER MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THE WHOLE BUSINESS
AND HE WAS JUST ASKING HIMSELF WHAT POSSIBLE CONNECTION WHEN THE SAILOR
OF HIS OWN ACCORD TURNED TO THE OTHER OCCUPANTS OF THE SHELTER WITH THE
REMARK
I SEEN HIM SHOOT TWO EGGS OFF TWO BOTTLES AT FIFTY YARDS OVER HIS
SHOULDER
THE LEFTHAND DEAD SHOT
THOUGH HE WAS SLIGHTLY HAMPERED BY AN OCCASIONAL STAMMER AND HIS
GESTURES BEING ALSO CLUMSY AS IT WAS STILL HE DID HIS BEST TO EXPLAIN
BOTTLES OUT THERE SAY
FIFTY YARDS MEASURED
EGGS ON THE BOTTLES
COCKS HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER
AIMS
HE TURNED HIS BODY HALF ROUND SHUT UP HIS RIGHT EYE COMPLETELY
THEN HE
SCREWED HIS FEATURES UP SOMEWAY SIDEWAYS AND GLARED OUT INTO THE NIGHT
WITH AN UNPREPOSSESSING CAST OF COUNTENANCE
POM HE THEN SHOUTED ONCE
THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE WAITED ANTICIPATING AN ADDITIONAL DETONATION THERE
BEING STILL A FURTHER EGG
POM HE SHOUTED TWICE
EGG TWO EVIDENTLY DEMOLISHED HE NODDED AND WINKED ADDING
BLOODTHIRSTILY
BUFFALO BILL SHOOTS TO KILL NEVER MISSED NOR HE NEVER WILL
A SILENCE ENSUED TILL MR BLOOM FOR AGREEABLENESS' SAKE JUST FELT LIKE
ASKING HIM WHETHER IT WAS FOR A MARKSMANSHIP COMPETITION LIKE THE
BISLEY
BEG PARDON THE SAILOR SAID
LONG AGO MR BLOOM PURSUED WITHOUT FLINCHING A HAIRSBREADTH
WHY THE SAILOR REPLIED RELAXING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT UNDER THE MAGIC
INFLUENCE OF DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND IT MIGHT BE A MATTER OF TEN YEARS
HE
TOURED THE WIDE WORLD WITH HENGLER'S ROYAL CIRCUS
I SEEN HIM DO THAT IN
STOCKHOLM
CURIOUS COINCIDENCE MR BLOOM CONFIDED TO STEPHEN UNOBTRUSIVELY
MURPHY'S MY NAME THE SAILOR CONTINUED

MR BLOOM COULD EASILY PICTURE HIS ADVENT ON THIS SCENE THE HOMECOMING
TO THE MARINER'S ROADSIDE SHIELING AFTER HAVING DIDDLED DAVY JONES
A RAINY NIGHT WITH A BLIND MOON
ACROSS THE WORLD FOR A WIFE
QUITE A
NUMBER OF STORIES THERE WERE ON THAT PARTICULAR ALICE BEN BOLT TOPIC

THE SAILOR WHO SCARCELY SEEMED TO BE A DUBLIN RESIDENT TURNED TO ONE
OF THE JARVIES WITH THE REQUEST
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE SUCH A THING AS A SPARE CHAW ABOUT YOU
THE JARVEY ADDRESSED AS IT HAPPENED HAD NOT BUT THE KEEPER TOOK A DIE OF
PLUG FROM HIS GOOD JACKET HANGING ON A NAIL AND THE DESIRED OBJECT WAS
PASSED FROM HAND TO HAND
THANK YOU THE SAILOR SAID
HE DEPOSITED THE QUID IN HIS GOB AND CHEWING AND WITH SOME SLOW
STAMMERS PROCEEDED

IN CONFIRMATION OF WHICH STATEMENT HE EXTRICATED FROM AN INSIDE POCKET
AND HANDED TO HIS NEIGHBOUR A NOT VERY CLEANLOOKING FOLDED DOCUMENT
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN A FAIR SHARE OF THE WORLD THE KEEPER REMARKED
LEANING ON THE COUNTER
WHY THE SAILOR ANSWERED UPON REFLECTION UPON IT I'VE CIRCUMNAVIGATED
A BIT SINCE I FIRST JOINED ON
I WAS IN THE RED SEA
I WAS IN CHINA AND
NORTH AMERICA AND SOUTH AMERICA
WE WAS CHASED BY PIRATES ONE VOYAGE
I SEEN ICEBERGS PLENTY GROWLERS
I WAS IN STOCKHOLM AND THE BLACK SEA
THE DARDANELLES UNDER CAPTAIN DALTON THE BEST BLOODY MAN THAT EVER
SCUTTLED A SHIP
I SEEN RUSSIA
GOSPODI POMILYOU
THAT'S HOW THE
RUSSIANS PRAYS
YOU SEEN QUEER SIGHTS DON'T BE TALKING PUT IN A JARVEY
WHY THE SAILOR SAID SHIFTING HIS PARTIALLY CHEWED PLUG
I SEEN
QUEER THINGS TOO UPS AND DOWNS
I SEEN A CROCODILE BITE THE FLUKE OF AN
ANCHOR SAME AS I CHEW THAT QUID
HE TOOK OUT OF HIS MOUTH THE PULPY QUID AND LODGING IT BETWEEN HIS
TEETH BIT FEROCIOUSLY
KHAAN LIKE THAT
AND I SEEN MANEATERS IN PERU THAT EATS CORPSES AND
THE LIVERS OF HORSES
LOOK HERE
HERE THEY ARE
A FRIEND OF MINE SENT
ME
HE FUMBLED OUT A PICTURE POSTCARD FROM HIS INSIDE POCKET WHICH SEEMED TO
BE IN ITS WAY A SPECIES OF REPOSITORY AND PUSHED IT ALONG THE TABLE
THE
PRINTED MATTER ON IT STATED CHOZA DE INDIOS
BENI BOLIVIA
ALL FOCUSSED THEIR ATTENTION AT THE SCENE EXHIBITED A GROUP OF SAVAGE
WOMEN IN STRIPED LOINCLOTHS SQUATTED BLINKING SUCKLING FROWNING
SLEEPING AMID A SWARM OF INFANTS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A SCORE OF
THEM OUTSIDE SOME PRIMITIVE SHANTIES OF OSIER
CHEWS COCA ALL DAY THE COMMUNICATIVE TARPAULIN ADDED
STOMACHS
LIKE BREADGRATERS
CUTS OFF THEIR DIDDIES WHEN THEY CAN'T BEAR NO MORE
CHILDREN
SEE THEM SITTING THERE STARK BALLOCKNAKED EATING A DEAD HORSE'S LIVER
RAW
HIS POSTCARD PROVED A CENTRE OF ATTRACTION FOR MESSRS THE GREENHORNS FOR
SEVERAL MINUTES IF NOT MORE
KNOW HOW TO KEEP THEM OFF HE INQUIRED GENERALLY
NOBODY VOLUNTEERING A STATEMENT HE WINKED SAYING
GLASS
THAT BOGGLES 'EM
GLASS
MR BLOOM WITHOUT EVINCING SURPRISE UNOSTENTATIOUSLY TURNED OVER THE
CARD TO PERUSE THE PARTIALLY OBLITERATED ADDRESS AND POSTMARK
IT RAN
AS FOLLOWS TARJETA POSTAL SEOR A BOUDIN GALERIA BECCHE SANTIAGO
CHILE THERE WAS NO MESSAGE EVIDENTLY AS HE TOOK PARTICULAR NOTICE
THOUGH NOT AN IMPLICIT BELIEVER IN THE LURID STORY NARRATED OR THE
EGGSNIPING TRANSACTION FOR THAT MATTER DESPITE WILLIAM TELL AND THE
LAZARILLO DON CESAR DE BAZAN INCIDENT DEPICTED IN MARITANA ON WHICH
OCCASION THE FORMER'S BALL PASSED THROUGH THE LATTER'S HAT HAVING
DETECTED A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN HIS NAME ASSUMING HE WAS THE PERSON
HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF TO BE AND NOT SAILING UNDER FALSE COLOURS
AFTER HAVING BOXED THE COMPASS ON THE STRICT Q T
SOMEWHERE AND
THE FICTITIOUS ADDRESSEE OF THE MISSIVE WHICH MADE HIM NOURISH SOME
SUSPICIONS OF OUR FRIEND'S BONA FIDES NEVERTHELESS IT REMINDED HIM IN
A WAY OF A LONGCHERISHED PLAN HE MEANT TO ONE DAY REALISE SOME WEDNESDAY
OR SATURDAY OF TRAVELLING TO LONDON VIA LONG SEA NOT TO SAY THAT HE HAD
EVER TRAVELLED EXTENSIVELY TO ANY GREAT EXTENT BUT HE WAS AT HEART A
BORN ADVENTURER THOUGH BY A TRICK OF FATE HE HAD CONSISTENTLY REMAINED
A LANDLUBBER EXCEPT YOU CALL GOING TO HOLYHEAD WHICH WAS HIS LONGEST
MARTIN CUNNINGHAM FREQUENTLY SAID HE WOULD WORK A PASS THROUGH EGAN BUT
SOME DEUCED HITCH OR OTHER ETERNALLY CROPPED UP WITH THE NET RESULT THAT
THE SCHEME FELL THROUGH
BUT EVEN SUPPOSE IT DID COME TO PLANKING
DOWN THE NEEDFUL AND BREAKING BOYD'S HEART IT WAS NOT SO DEAR PURSE
PERMITTING A FEW GUINEAS AT THE OUTSIDE CONSIDERING THE FARE TO
MULLINGAR WHERE HE FIGURED ON GOING WAS FIVE AND SIX THERE AND BACK
THE TRIP WOULD BENEFIT HEALTH ON ACCOUNT OF THE BRACING OZONE AND BE IN
EVERY WAY THOROUGHLY PLEASURABLE ESPECIALLY FOR A CHAP WHOSE LIVER WAS
OUT OF ORDER SEEING THE DIFFERENT PLACES ALONG THE ROUTE PLYMOUTH
FALMOUTH SOUTHAMPTON AND SO ON CULMINATING IN AN INSTRUCTIVE TOUR OF
THE SIGHTS OF THE GREAT METROPOLIS THE SPECTACLE OF OUR MODERN BABYLON
WHERE DOUBTLESS HE WOULD SEE THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT TOWER ABBEY
WEALTH OF PARK LANE TO RENEW ACQUAINTANCE WITH
ANOTHER THING JUST
STRUCK HIM AS A BY NO MEANS BAD NOTION WAS HE MIGHT HAVE A GAZE AROUND
ON THE SPOT TO SEE ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT A CONCERT
TOUR OF SUMMER MUSIC EMBRACING THE MOST PROMINENT PLEASURE RESORTS
MARGATE WITH MIXED BATHING AND FIRSTRATE HYDROS AND SPAS EASTBOURNE
SCARBOROUGH MARGATE AND SO ON BEAUTIFUL BOURNEMOUTH THE CHANNEL
ISLANDS AND SIMILAR BIJOU SPOTS WHICH MIGHT PROVE HIGHLY REMUNERATIVE
NOT OF COURSE WITH A HOLE AND CORNER SCRATCH COMPANY OR LOCAL LADIES
ON THE JOB WITNESS MRS C P M'COY TYPE LEND ME YOUR VALISE AND I'LL POST
YOU THE TICKET
NO SOMETHING TOP NOTCH AN ALL STAR IRISH CASTE THE
TWEEDY FLOWER GRAND OPERA COMPANY WITH HIS OWN LEGAL CONSORT AS LEADING
LADY AS A SORT OF COUNTERBLAST TO THE ELSTER GRIMES AND MOODY MANNERS
PERFECTLY SIMPLE MATTER AND HE WAS QUITE SANGUINE OF SUCCESS PROVIDING
PUFFS IN THE LOCAL PAPERS COULD BE MANAGED BY SOME FELLOW WITH A BIT OF
BOUNCE WHO COULD PULL THE INDISPENSABLE WIRES AND THUS COMBINE BUSINESS
WITH PLEASURE
BUT WHO THAT WAS THE RUB
ALSO WITHOUT BEING ACTUALLY
POSITIVE IT STRUCK HIM A GREAT FIELD WAS TO BE OPENED UP IN THE LINE
OF OPENING UP NEW ROUTES TO KEEP PACE WITH THE TIMES APROPOS OF THE
FISHGUARD ROSSLARE ROUTE WHICH IT WAS MOOTED WAS ONCE MORE ON THE
TAPIS IN THE CIRCUMLOCUTION DEPARTMENTS WITH THE USUAL QUANTITY OF RED
TAPE AND DILLYDALLYING OF EFFETE FOGEYDOM AND DUNDERHEADS GENERALLY
A
GREAT OPPORTUNITY THERE CERTAINLY WAS FOR PUSH AND ENTERPRISE TO MEET
THE TRAVELLING NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC AT LARGE THE AVERAGE MAN I E
BROWN ROBINSON AND CO
IT WAS A SUBJECT OF REGRET AND ABSURD AS WELL ON THE FACE OF IT AND NO
SMALL BLAME TO OUR VAUNTED SOCIETY THAT THE MAN IN THE STREET WHEN THE
SYSTEM REALLY NEEDED TONING UP FOR THE MATTER OF A COUPLE OF PALTRY
POUNDS WAS DEBARRED FROM SEEING MORE OF THE WORLD THEY LIVED IN INSTEAD
OF BEING ALWAYS AND EVER COOPED UP SINCE MY OLD STICK IN THE MUD TOOK ME
FOR A WIFE
AFTER ALL HANG IT THEY HAD THEIR ELEVEN AND MORE HUMDRUM
MONTHS OF IT AND MERITED A RADICAL CHANGE OF VENUE AFTER THE GRIND
OF CITY LIFE IN THE SUMMERTIME FOR CHOICE WHEN DAME NATURE IS AT HER
SPECTACULAR BEST CONSTITUTING NOTHING SHORT OF A NEW LEASE OF LIFE
THERE WERE EQUALLY EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR VACATIONISTS IN THE HOME
ISLAND DELIGHTFUL SYLVAN SPOTS FOR REJUVENATION OFFERING A PLETHORA
OF ATTRACTIONS AS WELL AS A BRACING TONIC FOR THE SYSTEM IN AND AROUND
DUBLIN AND ITS PICTURESQUE ENVIRONS EVEN POULAPHOUCA TO WHICH THERE WAS
A STEAMTRAM BUT ALSO FARTHER AWAY FROM THE MADDING CROWD IN WICKLOW
RIGHTLY TERMED THE GARDEN OF IRELAND AN IDEAL NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR ELDERLY
WHEELMEN SO LONG AS IT DIDN'T COME DOWN AND IN THE WILDS OF DONEGAL
WHERE IF REPORT SPOKE TRUE THE COUP D'OEIL WAS EXCEEDINGLY GRAND
THOUGH THE LASTNAMED LOCALITY WAS NOT EASILY GETATABLE SO THAT THE
INFLUX OF VISITORS WAS NOT AS YET ALL THAT IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERING THE
SIGNAL BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM IT WHILE HOWTH WITH ITS HISTORIC
ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHERWISE SILKEN THOMAS GRACE O'MALLEY GEORGE IV
RHODODENDRONS SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEALEVEL WAS A FAVOURITE HAUNT
WITH ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF MEN ESPECIALLY IN THE SPRING WHEN YOUNG
MEN'S FANCY THOUGH IT HAD ITS OWN TOLL OF DEATHS BY FALLING OFF THE
CLIFFS BY DESIGN OR ACCIDENTALLY USUALLY BY THE WAY ON THEIR LEFT
LEG IT BEING ONLY ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR'S RUN FROM THE
PILLAR
BECAUSE OF COURSE UPTODATE TOURIST TRAVELLING WAS AS YET MERELY
IN ITS INFANCY SO TO SPEAK AND THE ACCOMMODATION LEFT MUCH TO BE
DESIRED
INTERESTING TO FATHOM IT SEEMED TO HIM FROM A MOTIVE OF
CURIOSITY PURE AND SIMPLE WAS WHETHER IT WAS THE TRAFFIC THAT CREATED
THE ROUTE OR VICEVERSA OR THE TWO SIDES IN FACT
HE TURNED BACK THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE CARD PICTURE AND PASSED IT ALONG TO STEPHEN
I SEEN A CHINESE ONE TIME RELATED THE DOUGHTY NARRATOR THAT HAD
LITTLE PILLS LIKE PUTTY AND HE PUT THEM IN THE WATER AND THEY OPENED AND
EVERY PILL WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ONE WAS A SHIP ANOTHER WAS A HOUSE
ANOTHER WAS A FLOWER
COOKS RATS IN YOUR SOUP HE APPETISINGLY ADDED
THE CHINKS DOES
POSSIBLY PERCEIVING AN EXPRESSION OF DUBIOSITY ON THEIR FACES THE
GLOBETROTTER WENT ON ADHERING TO HIS ADVENTURES
AND I SEEN A MAN KILLED IN TRIESTE BY AN ITALIAN CHAP
KNIFE IN HIS
BACK
KNIFE LIKE THAT
WHILST SPEAKING HE PRODUCED A DANGEROUSLOOKING CLASPKNIFE QUITE IN
KEEPING WITH HIS CHARACTER AND HELD IT IN THE STRIKING POSITION
IN A KNOCKINGSHOP IT WAS COUNT OF A TRYON BETWEEN TWO SMUGGLERS
FELLOW HID BEHIND A DOOR COME UP BEHIND HIM
LIKE THAT
PREPARE TO
MEET YOUR GOD SAYS HE
CHUK IT WENT INTO HIS BACK UP TO THE BUTT
HIS HEAVY GLANCE DROWSILY ROAMING ABOUT KIND OF DEFIED THEIR FURTHER
QUESTIONS EVEN SHOULD THEY BY ANY CHANCE WANT TO
THAT'S A GOOD BIT OF STEEL REPEATED HE EXAMINING HIS FORMIDABLE
STILETTO
AFTER WHICH HARROWING DENOUEMENT SUFFICIENT TO APPAL THE STOUTEST HE
SNAPPED THE BLADE TO AND STOWED THE WEAPON IN QUESTION AWAY AS BEFORE IN
HIS CHAMBER OF HORRORS OTHERWISE POCKET
THEY'RE GREAT FOR THE COLD STEEL SOMEBODY WHO WAS EVIDENTLY QUITE IN
THE DARK SAID FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEM ALL
THAT WAS WHY THEY THOUGHT
THE PARK MURDERS OF THE INVINCIBLES WAS DONE BY FOREIGNERS ON ACCOUNT OF
THEM USING KNIVES
AT THIS REMARK PASSED OBVIOUSLY IN THE SPIRIT OF WHERE IGNORANCE
IS BLISS MR B
AND STEPHEN EACH IN HIS OWN PARTICULAR WAY BOTH
INSTINCTIVELY EXCHANGED MEANING GLANCES IN A RELIGIOUS SILENCE OF THE
STRICTLY ENTRE NOUS VARIETY HOWEVER TOWARDS WHERE SKIN THE GOAT
ALIAS THE KEEPER NOT TURNING A HAIR WAS DRAWING SPURTS OF LIQUID
FROM HIS BOILER AFFAIR
HIS INSCRUTABLE FACE WHICH WAS REALLY A WORK
OF ART A PERFECT STUDY IN ITSELF BEGGARING DESCRIPTION CONVEYED
THE IMPRESSION THAT HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ONE JOT OF WHAT WAS GOING ON
FUNNY VERY
THERE ENSUED A SOMEWHAT LENGTHY PAUSE
ONE MAN WAS READING IN FITS AND
STARTS A STAINED BY COFFEE EVENING JOURNAL ANOTHER THE CARD WITH THE
NATIVES CHOZA DE ANOTHER THE SEAMAN'S DISCHARGE
MR BLOOM SO FAR
AS HE WAS PERSONALLY CONCERNED WAS JUST PONDERING IN PENSIVE MOOD
HE
VIVIDLY RECOLLECTED WHEN THE OCCURRENCE ALLUDED TO TOOK PLACE AS WELL
AS YESTERDAY ROUGHLY SOME SCORE OF YEARS PREVIOUSLY IN THE DAYS OF THE
LAND TROUBLES WHEN IT TOOK THE CIVILISED WORLD BY STORM FIGURATIVELY
SPEAKING EARLY IN THE EIGHTIES EIGHTYONE TO BE CORRECT WHEN HE WAS
JUST TURNED FIFTEEN
AY BOSS THE SAILOR BROKE IN
GIVE US BACK THEM PAPERS
THE REQUEST BEING COMPLIED WITH HE CLAWED THEM UP WITH A SCRAPE
HAVE YOU SEEN THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR MR BLOOM INQUIRED
THE SAILOR GRIMACED CHEWING IN A WAY THAT MIGHT BE READ AS YES AY OR
NO
AH YOU'VE TOUCHED THERE TOO MR BLOOM SAID EUROPA POINT THINKING HE
HAD IN THE HOPE THAT THE ROVER MIGHT POSSIBLY BY SOME REMINISCENCES BUT
HE FAILED TO DO SO SIMPLY LETTING SPIRT A JET OF SPEW INTO THE SAWDUST
AND SHOOK HIS HEAD WITH A SORT OF LAZY SCORN
WHAT YEAR WOULD THAT BE ABOUT MR B INTERROGATED
CAN YOU RECALL THE
BOATS
OUR SOI DISANT SAILOR MUNCHED HEAVILY AWHILE HUNGRILY BEFORE
ANSWERING
I'M TIRED OF ALL THEM ROCKS IN THE SEA HE SAID AND BOATS AND SHIPS
SALT JUNK ALL THE TIME
TIRED SEEMINGLY HE CEASED
HIS QUESTIONER PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS NOT
LIKELY TO GET A GREAT DEAL OF CHANGE OUT OF SUCH A WILY OLD CUSTOMER
FELL TO WOOLGATHERING ON THE ENORMOUS DIMENSIONS OF THE WATER ABOUT THE
GLOBE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT AS A CASUAL GLANCE AT THE MAP REVEALED
IT COVERED FULLY THREE FOURTHS OF IT AND HE FULLY REALISED ACCORDINGLY
WHAT IT MEANT TO RULE THE WAVES
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION A DOZEN
AT THE LOWEST NEAR THE NORTH BULL AT DOLLYMOUNT HE HAD REMARKED A
SUPERANNUATED OLD SALT EVIDENTLY DERELICT SEATED HABITUALLY NEAR THE
NOT PARTICULARLY REDOLENT SEA ON THE WALL STARING QUITE OBLIVIOUSLY AT
IT AND IT AT HIM DREAMING OF FRESH WOODS AND PASTURES NEW AS SOMEONE
SOMEWHERE SINGS
AND IT LEFT HIM WONDERING WHY
POSSIBLY HE HAD TRIED TO
FIND OUT THE SECRET FOR HIMSELF FLOUNDERING UP AND DOWN THE ANTIPODES
AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING AND OVER AND UNDER WELL NOT EXACTLY UNDER
TEMPTING THE FATES
AND THE ODDS WERE TWENTY TO NIL THERE WAS REALLY NO
SECRET ABOUT IT AT ALL
NEVERTHELESS WITHOUT GOING INTO THE MINUTIAE
OF THE BUSINESS THE ELOQUENT FACT REMAINED THAT THE SEA WAS THERE IN
ALL ITS GLORY AND IN THE NATURAL COURSE OF THINGS SOMEBODY OR OTHER HAD
TO SAIL ON IT AND FLY IN THE FACE OF PROVIDENCE THOUGH IT MERELY WENT
TO SHOW HOW PEOPLE USUALLY CONTRIVED TO LOAD THAT SORT OF ONUS ON TO THE
OTHER FELLOW LIKE THE HELL IDEA AND THE LOTTERY AND INSURANCE WHICH WERE
RUN ON IDENTICALLY THE SAME LINES SO THAT FOR THAT VERY REASON IF NO
OTHER LIFEBOAT SUNDAY WAS A HIGHLY LAUDABLE INSTITUTION TO WHICH THE
PUBLIC AT LARGE NO MATTER WHERE LIVING INLAND OR SEASIDE AS THE CASE
MIGHT BE HAVING IT BROUGHT HOME TO THEM LIKE THAT SHOULD EXTEND ITS
GRATITUDE ALSO TO THE HARBOURMASTERS AND COASTGUARD SERVICE WHO HAD
TO MAN THE RIGGING AND PUSH OFF AND OUT AMID THE ELEMENTS WHATEVER THE
SEASON WHEN DUTY CALLED IRELAND EXPECTS THAT EVERY MAN AND SO ON AND
SOMETIMES HAD A TERRIBLE TIME OF IT IN THE WINTERTIME NOT FORGETTING THE
IRISH LIGHTS KISH AND OTHERS LIABLE TO CAPSIZE AT ANY MOMENT ROUNDING
WHICH HE ONCE WITH HIS DAUGHTER HAD EXPERIENCED SOME REMARKABLY CHOPPY
NOT TO SAY STORMY WEATHER
THERE WAS A FELLOW SAILED WITH ME IN THE ROVER THE OLD SEADOG
HIMSELF A ROVER PROCEEDED WENT ASHORE AND TOOK UP A SOFT JOB AS
GENTLEMAN'S VALET AT SIX QUID A MONTH
THEM ARE HIS TROUSERS I'VE ON
ME AND HE GAVE ME AN OILSKIN AND THAT JACKKNIFE
I'M GAME FOR THAT JOB
SHAVING AND BRUSHUP
I HATE ROAMING ABOUT
THERE'S MY SON NOW DANNY
RUN OFF TO SEA AND HIS MOTHER GOT HIM TOOK IN A DRAPER'S IN CORK WHERE
HE COULD BE DRAWING EASY MONEY
WHAT AGE IS HE QUERIED ONE HEARER WHO BY THE WAY SEEN FROM THE
SIDE BORE A DISTANT RESEMBLANCE TO HENRY CAMPBELL THE TOWNCLERK AWAY
FROM THE CARKING CARES OF OFFICE UNWASHED OF COURSE AND IN A SEEDY
GETUP AND A STRONG SUSPICION OF NOSEPAINT ABOUT THE NASAL APPENDAGE
WHY THE SAILOR ANSWERED WITH A SLOW PUZZLED UTTERANCE MY SON DANNY
HE'D BE ABOUT EIGHTEEN NOW WAY I FIGURE IT
THE SKIBBEREEN FATHER HEREUPON TORE OPEN HIS GREY OR UNCLEAN ANYHOW
SHIRT WITH HIS TWO HANDS AND SCRATCHED AWAY AT HIS CHEST ON WHICH WAS TO
BE SEEN AN IMAGE TATTOOED IN BLUE CHINESE INK INTENDED TO REPRESENT AN
ANCHOR
THERE WAS LICE IN THAT BUNK IN BRIDGWATER HE REMARKED SURE AS NUTS
I MUST GET A WASH TOMORROW OR NEXT DAY
IT'S THEM BLACK LADS I OBJECTS
TO
I HATE THOSE BUGGERS
SUCK YOUR BLOOD DRY THEY DOES
SEEING THEY WERE ALL LOOKING AT HIS CHEST HE ACCOMMODATINGLY DRAGGED
HIS SHIRT MORE OPEN SO THAT ON TOP OF THE TIMEHONOURED SYMBOL OF THE
MARINER'S HOPE AND REST THEY HAD A FULL VIEW OF THE FIGURE 16 AND A
YOUNG MAN'S SIDEFACE LOOKING FROWNINGLY RATHER
TATTOO THE EXHIBITOR EXPLAINED
THAT WAS DONE WHEN WE WERE IYING
BECALMED OFF ODESSA IN THE BLACK SEA UNDER CAPTAIN DALTON
FELLOW THE
NAME OF ANTONIO DONE THAT
THERE HE IS HIMSELF A GREEK
DID IT HURT MUCH DOING IT ONE ASKED THE SAILOR
THAT WORTHY HOWEVER WAS BUSILY ENGAGED IN COLLECTING ROUND THE
SOMEWAY IN HIS
SQUEEZING OR
SEE HERE HE SAID SHOWING ANTONIO
THERE HE IS CURSING THE MATE
AND
THERE HE IS NOW HE ADDED THE SAME FELLOW PULLING THE SKIN WITH HIS
FINGERS SOME SPECIAL KNACK EVIDENTLY AND HE LAUGHING AT A YARN
AND IN POINT OF FACT THE YOUNG MAN NAMED ANTONIO'S LIVID FACE DID
ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE FORCED SMILING AND THE CURIOUS EFFECT EXCITED THE
UNRESERVED ADMIRATION OF EVERYBODY INCLUDING SKIN THE GOAT WHO THIS
TIME STRETCHED OVER
AY AY SIGHED THE SAILOR LOOKING DOWN ON HIS MANLY CHEST
HE'S GONE
TOO
ATE BY SHARKS AFTER
AY AY
HE LET GO OF THE SKIN SO THAT THE PROFILE RESUMED THE NORMAL EXPRESSION
OF BEFORE
NEAT BIT OF WORK ONE LONGSHOREMAN SAID
AND WHAT'S THE NUMBER FOR LOAFER NUMBER TWO QUERIED
EATEN ALIVE A THIRD ASKED THE SAILOR
AY AY SIGHED AGAIN THE LATTER PERSONAGE MORE CHEERILY THIS
TIME WITH SOME SORT OF A HALF SMILE FOR A BRIEF DURATION ONLY IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE QUESTIONER ABOUT THE NUMBER
ATE
A GREEK HE WAS
AND THEN HE ADDED WITH RATHER GALLOWSBIRD HUMOUR CONSIDERING HIS ALLEGED
END
AS BAD AS OLD ANTONIO FOR HE LEFT ME ON MY OWNIO
THE FACE OF A STREETWALKER GLAZED AND HAGGARD UNDER A BLACK STRAW HAT
PEERED ASKEW ROUND THE DOOR OF THE SHELTER PALPABLY RECONNOITRING ON
HER OWN WITH THE OBJECT OF BRINGING MORE GRIST TO HER MILL
MR
BLOOM SCARCELY KNOWING WHICH WAY TO LOOK TURNED AWAY ON THE MOMENT
FLUSTERFIED BUT OUTWARDLY CALM AND PICKING UP FROM THE TABLE THE PINK
SHEET OF THE ABBEY STREET ORGAN WHICH THE JARVEY IF SUCH HE WAS HAD
LAID ASIDE HE PICKED IT UP AND LOOKED AT THE PINK OF THE PAPER THOUGH
WHY PINK
HIS REASON FOR SO DOING WAS HE RECOGNISED ON THE MOMENT
ROUND THE DOOR THE SAME FACE HE HAD CAUGHT A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF THAT
AFTERNOON ON ORMOND QUAY THE PARTIALLY IDIOTIC FEMALE NAMELY OF THE
LANE WHO KNEW THE LADY IN THE BROWN COSTUME DOES BE WITH YOU MRS B
AND BEGGED THE CHANCE OF HIS WASHING
ALSO WHY WASHING WHICH SEEMED
RATHER VAGUE THAN NOT YOUR WASHING
STILL CANDOUR COMPELLED HIM TO
ADMIT HE HAD WASHED HIS WIFE'S UNDERGARMENTS WHEN SOILED IN HOLLES
STREET AND WOMEN WOULD AND DID TOO A MAN'S SIMILAR GARMENTS INITIALLED
WITH BEWLEY AND DRAPER'S MARKING INK HERS WERE THAT IS IF THEY REALLY
LOVED HIM THAT IS TO SAY LOVE ME LOVE MY DIRTY SHIRT
STILL JUST
THEN BEING ON TENTERHOOKS HE DESIRED THE FEMALE'S ROOM MORE THAN HER
COMPANY SO IT CAME AS A GENUINE RELIEF WHEN THE KEEPER MADE HER A RUDE
SIGN TO TAKE HERSELF OFF
ROUND THE SIDE OF THE EVENING TELEGRAPH HE
JUST CAUGHT A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HER FACE ROUND THE SIDE OF THE DOOR
WITH A KIND OF DEMENTED GLASSY GRIN SHOWING THAT SHE WAS NOT EXACTLY ALL
THERE VIEWING WITH EVIDENT AMUSEMENT THE GROUP OF GAZERS ROUND SKIPPER
MURPHY'S NAUTICAL CHEST AND THEN THERE WAS NO MORE OF HER
THE GUNBOAT THE KEEPER SAID
IT BEATS ME MR BLOOM CONFIDED TO STEPHEN MEDICALLY I AM SPEAKING
HOW A WRETCHED CREATURE LIKE THAT FROM THE LOCK HOSPITAL REEKING WITH
DISEASE CAN BE BAREFACED ENOUGH TO SOLICIT OR HOW ANY MAN IN HIS SOBER
SENSES IF HE VALUES HIS HEALTH IN THE LEAST
UNFORTUNATE CREATURE OF
COURSE I SUPPOSE SOME MAN IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HER CONDITION
STILL NO MATTER WHAT THE CAUSE IS FROM
STEPHEN HAD NOT NOTICED HER AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS MERELY
REMARKING
IN THIS COUNTRY PEOPLE SELL MUCH MORE THAN SHE EVER HAD AND DO A
ROARING TRADE
FEAR NOT THEM THAT SELL THE BODY BUT HAVE NOT POWER TO
BUY THE SOUL
SHE IS A BAD MERCHANT
SHE BUYS DEAR AND SELLS CHEAP
THE ELDER MAN THOUGH NOT BY ANY MANNER OF MEANS AN OLD MAID OR A PRUDE
SAID IT WAS NOTHING SHORT OF A CRYING SCANDAL THAT OUGHT TO BE PUT A
STOP TO INSTANTER TO SAY THAT WOMEN OF THAT STAMP QUITE APART FROM
ANY OLDMAIDISH SQUEAMISHNESS ON THE SUBJECT A NECESSARY EVIL W ERE
NOT LICENSED AND MEDICALLY INSPECTED BY THE PROPER AUTHORITIES A THING
HE COULD TRUTHFULLY STATE HE AS A PATERFAMILIAS WAS A STALWART
ADVOCATE OF FROM THE VERY FIRST START
WHOEVER EMBARKED ON A POLICY OF
THE SORT HE SAID AND VENTILATED THE MATTER THOROUGHLY WOULD CONFER A
LASTING BOON ON EVERYBODY CONCERNED
YOU AS A GOOD CATHOLIC HE OBSERVED TALKING OF BODY AND SOUL BELIEVE
IN THE SOUL
OR DO YOU MEAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE BRAINPOWER AS SUCH
AS DISTINCT FROM ANY OUTSIDE OBJECT THE TABLE LET US SAY THAT CUP
I
BELIEVE IN THAT MYSELF BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN EXPLAINED BY COMPETENT MEN AS
THE CONVOLUTIONS OF THE GREY MATTER
OTHERWISE WE WOULD NEVER HAVE SUCH
INVENTIONS AS X RAYS FOR INSTANCE
DO YOU
THUS CORNERED STEPHEN HAD TO MAKE A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT OF MEMORY TO TRY
AND CONCENTRATE AND REMEMBER BEFORE HE COULD SAY
THEY TELL ME ON THE BEST AUTHORITY IT IS A SIMPLE SUBSTANCE AND
THEREFORE INCORRUPTIBLE
IT WOULD BE IMMORTAL I UNDERSTAND BUT FOR THE
POSSIBILITY OF ITS ANNIHILATION BY ITS FIRST CAUSE WHO FROM ALL I
CAN HEAR IS QUITE CAPABLE OF ADDING THAT TO THE NUMBER OF HIS OTHER
PRACTICAL JOKES CORRUPTIO PER SE AND CORRUPTIO PER ACCIDENS BOTH
BEING EXCLUDED BY COURT ETIQUETTE
MR BLOOM THOROUGHLY ACQUIESCED IN THE GENERAL GIST OF THIS THOUGH THE
MYSTICAL FINESSE INVOLVED WAS A BIT OUT OF HIS SUBLUNARY DEPTH STILL
HE FELT BOUND TO ENTER A DEMURRER ON THE HEAD OF SIMPLE PROMPTLY
REJOINING
SIMPLE I SHOULDN'T THINK THAT IS THE PROPER WORD
OF COURSE I GRANT
YOU TO CONCEDE A POINT YOU DO KNOCK ACROSS A SIMPLE SOUL ONCE IN A
BLUE MOON
BUT WHAT I AM ANXIOUS TO ARRIVE AT IS IT IS ONE THING FOR
INSTANCE TO INVENT THOSE RAYS RONTGEN DID OR THE TELESCOPE LIKE EDISON
THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS BEFORE HIS TIME GALILEO WAS THE MAN I MEAN
AND THE SAME APPLIES TO THE LAWS FOR EXAMPLE OF A FARREACHING NATURAL
PHENOMENON SUCH AS ELECTRICITY BUT IT'S A HORSE OF QUITE ANOTHER COLOUR
TO SAY YOU BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF A SUPERNATURAL GOD
O THAT STEPHEN EXPOSTULATED HAS BEEN PROVED CONCLUSIVELY BY SEVERAL
OF THE BESTKNOWN PASSAGES IN HOLY WRIT APART FROM CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE
ON THIS KNOTTY POINT HOWEVER THE VIEWS OF THE PAIR POLES APART AS THEY
WERE BOTH IN SCHOOLING AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITH THE MARKED DIFFERENCE IN
THEIR RESPECTIVE AGES CLASHED
HAS BEEN THE MORE EXPERIENCED OF THE TWO OBJECTED STICKING TO HIS
ORIGINAL POINT WITH A SMILE OF UNBELIEF
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT
THAT'S A MATTER FOR EVERYMAN'S OPINION AND WITHOUT DRAGGING IN THE
SECTARIAN SIDE OF THE BUSINESS I BEG TO DIFFER WITH YOU IN TOTO
THERE
MY BELIEF IS TO TELL YOU THE CANDID TRUTH THAT THOSE BITS WERE
GENUINE FORGERIES ALL OF THEM PUT IN BY MONKS MOST PROBABLY OR IT'S THE
BIG QUESTION OF OUR NATIONAL POET OVER AGAIN WHO PRECISELY WROTE THEM
LIKE HAMLET AND BACON AS YOU WHO KNOW YOUR SHAKESPEARE INFINITELY
BETTER THAN I OF COURSE I NEEDN'T TELL YOU
CAN'T YOU DRINK THAT
COFFEE BY THE WAY LET ME STIR IT
AND TAKE A PIECE OF THAT BUN
IT'S
LIKE ONE OF OUR SKIPPER'S BRICKS DISGUISED
STILL NO ONE CAN GIVE WHAT
HE HASN'T GOT
TRY A BIT
COULDN'T STEPHEN CONTRIVED TO GET OUT HIS MENTAL ORGANS FOR THE
MOMENT REFUSING TO DICTATE FURTHER
FAULTFINDING BEING A PROVERBIALLY BAD HAT MR BLOOM THOUGHT WELL TO STIR
OR TRY TO THE CLOTTED SUGAR FROM THE BOTTOM AND REFLECTED WITH SOMETHING
APPROACHING ACRIMONY ON THE COFFEE PALACE AND ITS TEMPERANCE AND
LUCRATIVE WORK
TO BE SURE IT WAS A LEGITIMATE OBJECT AND BEYOND YEA OR
NAY DID A WORLD OF GOOD SHELTERS SUCH AS THE PRESENT ONE THEY WERE IN
RUN ON TEETOTAL LINES FOR VAGRANTS AT NIGHT CONCERTS DRAMATIC EVENINGS
AND USEFUL LECTURES ADMITTANCE FREE BY QUALIFIED MEN FOR THE LOWER
ORDERS
ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAD A DISTINCT AND PAINFUL RECOLLECTION
THEY PAID HIS WIFE MADAM MARION TWEEDY WHO HAD BEEN PROMINENTLY
ASSOCIATED WITH IT AT ONE TIME A VERY MODEST REMUNERATION INDEED FOR
HER PIANOPLAYING
THE IDEA HE WAS STRONGLY INCLINED TO BELIEVE WAS
TO DO GOOD AND NET A PROFIT THERE BEING NO COMPETITION TO SPEAK
OF
SULPHATE OF COPPER POISON SO4 OR SOMETHING IN SOME DRIED PEAS HE
REMEMBERED READING OF IN A CHEAP EATINGHOUSE SOMEWHERE BUT HE COULDN'T
REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS OR WHERE
ANYHOW INSPECTION MEDICAL INSPECTION
OF ALL EATABLES SEEMED TO HIM MORE THAN EVER NECESSARY WHICH POSSIBLY
ACCOUNTED FOR THE VOGUE OF DR TIBBLE'S VI COCOA ON ACCOUNT OF THE
MEDICAL ANALYSIS INVOLVED
HAVE A SHOT AT IT NOW HE VENTURED TO SAY OF THE COFFEE AFTER BEING
STIRRED
THUS PREVAILED ON TO AT ANY RATE TASTE IT STEPHEN LIFTED THE HEAVY MUG
FROM THE BROWN PUDDLE IT CLOPPED OUT OF WHEN TAKEN UP BY THE HANDLE AND
TOOK A SIP OF THE OFFENDING BEVERAGE
STILL IT'S SOLID FOOD HIS GOOD GENIUS URGED I'M A STICKLER FOR SOLID
FOOD HIS ONE AND ONLY REASON BEING NOT GORMANDISING IN THE LEAST BUT
REGULAR MEALS AS THE SINE QUA NON FOR ANY KIND OF PROPER WORK MENTAL
OR MANUAL
YOU OUGHT TO EAT MORE SOLID FOOD
YOU WOULD FEEL A DIFFERENT
MAN
LIQUIDS I CAN EAT STEPHEN SAID
BUT O OBLIGE ME BY TAKING AWAY THAT
KNIFE
I CAN'T LOOK AT THE POINT OF IT
IT REMINDS ME OF ROMAN HISTORY
MR BLOOM PROMPTLY DID AS SUGGESTED AND REMOVED THE INCRIMINATED ARTICLE
A BLUNT HORNHANDLED ORDINARY KNIFE WITH NOTHING PARTICULARLY ROMAN OR
ANTIQUE ABOUT IT TO THE LAY EYE OBSERVING THAT THE POINT WAS THE LEAST
CONSPICUOUS POINT ABOUT IT
OUR MUTUAL FRIEND'S STORIES ARE LIKE HIMSELF MR BLOOM APROPOS OF
KNIVES REMARKED TO HIS CONFIDANTE SOTTO VOCE
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE
GENUINE HE COULD SPIN THOSE YARNS FOR HOURS ON END ALL NIGHT LONG AND
LIE LIKE OLD BOOTS
LOOK AT HIM
YET STILL THOUGH HIS EYES WERE THICK WITH SLEEP AND SEA AIR LIFE WAS
FULL OF A HOST OF THINGS AND COINCIDENCES OF A TERRIBLE NATURE AND IT
WAS QUITE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF POSSIBILITY THAT IT WAS NOT AN
ENTIRE FABRICATION THOUGH AT FIRST BLUSH THERE WAS NOT MUCH INHERENT
PROBABILITY IN ALL THE SPOOF HE GOT OFF HIS CHEST BEING STRICTLY
ACCURATE GOSPEL
HE HAD BEEN MEANTIME TAKING STOCK OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN FRONT OF HIM AND
SHERLOCKHOLMESING HIM UP EVER SINCE HE CLAPPED EYES ON HIM
THOUGH A
WELLPRESERVED MAN OF NO LITTLE STAMINA IF A TRIFLE PRONE TO BALDNESS
THERE WAS SOMETHING SPURIOUS IN THE CUT OF HIS JIB THAT SUGGESTED A JAIL
DELIVERY AND IT REQUIRED NO VIOLENT STRETCH OF IMAGINATION TO ASSOCIATE
SUCH A WEIRDLOOKING SPECIMEN WITH THE OAKUM AND TREADMILL FRATERNITY
HE
MIGHT EVEN HAVE DONE FOR HIS MAN SUPPOSING IT WAS HIS OWN CASE HE TOLD
AS PEOPLE OFTEN DID ABOUT OTHERS NAMELY THAT HE KILLED HIM HIMSELF
AND HAD SERVED HIS FOUR OR FIVE GOODLOOKING YEARS IN DURANCE VILE TO SAY
NOTHING OF THE ANTONIO PERSONAGE NO RELATION TO THE DRAMATIC PERSONAGE
OF IDENTICAL NAME WHO SPRANG FROM THE PEN OF OUR NATIONAL POET WHO
EXPIATED HIS CRIMES IN THE MELODRAMATIC MANNER ABOVE DESCRIBED
ON THE
OTHER HAND HE MIGHT BE ONLY BLUFFING A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS BECAUSE
MEETING UNMISTAKABLE MUGS DUBLIN RESIDENTS LIKE THOSE JARVIES WAITING
NEWS FROM ABROAD WOULD TEMPT ANY ANCIENT MARINER WHO SAILED THE OCEAN
SEAS TO DRAW THE LONG BOW ABOUT THE SCHOONER HESPERUS AND ETCETERA
AND WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND DONE THE LIES A FELLOW TOLD ABOUT HIMSELF
COULDN'T PROBABLY HOLD A PROVERBIAL CANDLE TO THE WHOLESALE WHOPPERS
OTHER FELLOWS COINED ABOUT HIM
MIND YOU I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT'S ALL A PURE INVENTION HE RESUMED
ANALOGOUS SCENES ARE OCCASIONALLY IF NOT OFTEN MET WITH
GIANTS
THOUGH THAT IS RATHER A FAR CRY YOU SEE ONCE IN A WAY MARCELLA THE
MIDGET QUEEN
IN THOSE WAXWORKS IN HENRY STREET I MYSELF SAW SOME
AZTECS AS THEY ARE CALLED SITTING BOWLEGGED THEY COULDN'T STRAIGHTEN
THEIR LEGS IF YOU PAID THEM BECAUSE THE MUSCLES HERE YOU SEE HE
PROCEEDED INDICATING ON HIS COMPANION THE BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE SINEWS
OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO CALL THEM BEHIND THE RIGHT KNEE WERE UTTERLY
POWERLESS FROM SITTING THAT WAY SO LONG CRAMPED UP BEING ADORED AS
GODS
THERE'S AN EXAMPLE AGAIN OF SIMPLE SOULS
HOWEVER REVERTING TO FRIEND SINBAD AND HIS HORRIFYING ADVENTURES WHO
REMINDED HIM A BIT OF LUDWIG ALIAS LEDWIDGE WHEN HE OCCUPIED
THE BOARDS OF THE GAIETY WHEN MICHAEL GUNN WAS IDENTIFIED WITH THE
MANAGEMENT IN THE FLYING DUTCHMAN A STUPENDOUS SUCCESS AND HIS HOST
OF ADMIRERS CAME IN LARGE NUMBERS EVERYONE SIMPLY FLOCKING TO HEAR HIM
THOUGH SHIPS OF ANY SORT PHANTOM OR THE REVERSE ON THE STAGE USUALLY
FELL A BIT FLAT AS ALSO DID TRAINS THERE WAS NOTHING INTRINSICALLY
INCOMPATIBLE ABOUT IT HE CONCEDED
ON THE CONTRARY THAT STAB IN THE
BACK TOUCH WAS QUITE IN KEEPING WITH THOSE ITALIANOS THOUGH CANDIDLY HE
WAS NONE THE LESS FREE TO ADMIT THOSE ICECREAMERS AND FRIERS IN THE FISH
WAY NOT TO MENTION THE CHIP POTATO VARIETY AND SO FORTH OVER IN LITTLE
ITALY THERE NEAR THE COOMBE WERE SOBER THRIFTY HARDWORKING FELLOWS
EXCEPT PERHAPS A BIT TOO GIVEN TO POTHUNTING THE HARMLESS NECESSARY
ANIMAL OF THE FELINE PERSUASION OF OTHERS AT NIGHT SO AS TO HAVE A GOOD
OLD SUCCULENT TUCKIN WITH GARLIC DE RIGUEUR OFF HIM OR HER NEXT DAY ON
THE QUIET AND HE ADDED ON THE CHEAP
SPANIARDS FOR INSTANCE HE CONTINUED PASSIONATE TEMPERAMENTS LIKE
THAT IMPETUOUS AS OLD NICK ARE GIVEN TO TAKING THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN
HANDS AND GIVE YOU YOUR QUIETUS DOUBLEQUICK WITH THOSE POIGNARDS THEY
CARRY IN THE ABDOMEN
IT COMES FROM THE GREAT HEAT CLIMATE GENERALLY
MY WIFE IS SO TO SPEAK SPANISH HALF THAT IS
POINT OF FACT SHE COULD
ACTUALLY CLAIM SPANISH NATIONALITY IF SHE WANTED HAVING BEEN BORN IN
TECHNICALLY SPAIN I E
GIBRALTAR
SHE HAS THE SPANISH TYPE
QUITE
DARK REGULAR BRUNETTE BLACK
I FOR ONE CERTAINLY BELIEVE CLIMATE
ACCOUNTS FOR CHARACTER
THAT'S WHY I ASKED YOU IF YOU WROTE YOUR POETRY
IN ITALIAN
THE TEMPERAMENTS AT THE DOOR STEPHEN INTERPOSED WITH WERE VERY
PASSIONATE ABOUT TEN SHILLINGS
ROBERTO RUBA ROBA SUA
QUITE SO MR BLOOM DITTOED
THEN STEPHEN SAID STARING AND RAMBLING ON TO HIMSELF OR SOME UNKNOWN
LISTENER SOMEWHERE WE HAVE THE IMPETUOSITY OF DANTE AND THE ISOSCELES
TRIANGLE MISS PORTINARI HE FELL IN LOVE WITH AND LEONARDO AND SAN
TOMMASO MASTINO
IT'S IN THE BLOOD MR BLOOM ACCEDED AT ONCE
ALL ARE WASHED IN THE
BLOOD OF THE SUN
COINCIDENCE I JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN THE KILDARE
STREET MUSEUM 890 TODAY SHORTLY PRIOR TO OUR MEETING IF I CAN SO CALL
IT AND I WAS JUST LOOKING AT THOSE ANTIQUE STATUES THERE
THE SPLENDID
PROPORTIONS OF HIPS BOSOM
YOU SIMPLY DON'T KNOCK AGAINST THOSE KIND OF
WOMEN HERE
AN EXCEPTION HERE AND THERE
HANDSOME YES PRETTY IN A WAY
YOU FIND BUT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE FEMALE FORM
BESIDES THEY
HAVE SO LITTLE TASTE IN DRESS MOST OF THEM WHICH GREATLY ENHANCES A
WOMAN'S NATURAL BEAUTY NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY
RUMPLED STOCKINGS IT
MAY BE POSSIBLY IS A FOIBLE OF MINE BUT STILL IT'S A THING I SIMPLY
HATE TO SEE
INTEREST HOWEVER WAS STARTING TO FLAG SOMEWHAT ALL ROUND AND THEN THE
OTHERS GOT ON TO TALKING ABOUT ACCIDENTS AT SEA SHIPS LOST IN A FOG
GOO COLLISIONS WITH ICEBERGS ALL THAT SORT OF THING
SHIPAHOY OF COURSE
HAD HIS OWN SAY TO SAY
HE HAD DOUBLED THE CAPE A FEW ODD TIMES AND
WEATHERED A MONSOON A KIND OF WIND IN THE CHINA SEAS AND THROUGH ALL
THOSE PERILS OF THE DEEP THERE WAS ONE THING HE DECLARED STOOD TO HIM
OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT A PIOUS MEDAL HE HAD THAT SAVED HIM
SO THEN AFTER THAT THEY DRIFTED ON TO THE WRECK OFF DAUNT'S ROCK WRECK
OF THAT ILLFATED NORWEGIAN BARQUE NOBODY COULD THINK OF HER NAME FOR
THE MOMENT TILL THE JARVEY WHO HAD REALLY QUITE A LOOK OF HENRY CAMPBELL
REMEMBERED IT PALME ON BOOTERSTOWN STRAND
THAT WAS THE TALK OF THE
TOWN THAT YEAR ALBERT WILLIAM QUILL WROTE A FINE PIECE OF ORIGINAL
VERSE OF 910 DISTINCTIVE MERIT ON THE TOPIC FOR THE IRISH TIMES
BREAKERS RUNNING OVER HER AND CROWDS AND CROWDS ON THE SHORE IN
COMMOTION PETRIFIED WITH HORROR
THEN SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE
CASE OF THE S
S
LADY CAIRNS OF SWANSEA RUN INTO BY THE MONA WHICH
WAS ON AN OPPOSITE TACK IN RATHER MUGGYISH WEATHER AND LOST WITH ALL
HANDS ON DECK
NO AID WAS GIVEN
HER MASTER THE MONA'S SAID HE
WAS AFRAID HIS COLLISION BULKHEAD WOULD GIVE WAY
SHE HAD NO WATER IT
APPEARS IN HER HOLD
AT THIS STAGE AN INCIDENT HAPPENED
IT HAVING BECOME NECESSARY FOR HIM
TO UNFURL A REEF THE SAILOR VACATED HIS SEAT
LET ME CROSS YOUR BOWS MATE HE SAID TO HIS NEIGHBOUR WHO WAS JUST
GENTLY DROPPING OFF INTO A PEACEFUL DOZE
HE MADE TRACKS HEAVILY SLOWLY WITH A DUMPY SORT OF A GAIT TO THE DOOR
STEPPED HEAVILY DOWN THE ONE STEP THERE WAS OUT OF THE SHELTER AND BORE
DUE LEFT
WHILE HE WAS IN THE ACT OF GETTING HIS BEARINGS MR BLOOM WHO
NOTICED WHEN HE STOOD UP THAT HE HAD TWO FLASKS OF PRESUMABLY SHIP'S
RUM STICKING ONE OUT OF EACH POCKET FOR THE PRIVATE CONSUMPTION OF HIS
BURNING INTERIOR SAW HIM PRODUCE A BOTTLE AND UNCORK IT OR UNSCREW AND
APPLYING ITS NOZZ1E TO HIS LIPS TAKE A GOOD OLD DELECTABLE SWIG OUT OF
IT WITH A GURGLING NOISE
THE IRREPRESSIBLE BLOOM WHO ALSO HAD A
SHREWD SUSPICION THAT THE OLD STAGER WENT OUT ON A MANOEUVRE AFTER THE
COUNTERATTRACTION IN THE SHAPE OF A FEMALE WHO HOWEVER HAD DISAPPEARED
TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES COULD BY STRAINING JUST PERCEIVE HIM WHEN
DULY REFRESHED BY HIS RUM PUNCHEON EXPLOIT GAPING UP AT THE PIERS AND
GIRDERS OF THE LOOP LINE RATHER OUT OF HIS DEPTH AS OF COURSE IT WAS ALL
RADICALLY ALTERED SINCE HIS LAST VISIT AND GREATLY IMPROVED
SOME PERSON
OR PERSONS INVISIBLE DIRECTED HIM TO THE MALE URINAL ERECTED BY THE
CLEANSING COMMITTEE ALL OVER THE PLACE FOR THE PURPOSE BUT AFTER A BRIEF
SPACE OF TIME DURING WHICH SILENCE REIGNED SUPREME THE SAILOR EVIDENTLY
GIVING IT A WIDE BERTH EASED HIMSELF CLOSER AT HAND THE NOISE OF HIS
BILGEWATER SOME LITTLE TIME SUBSEQUENTLY SPLASHING ON THE GROUND WHERE
IT APPARENTLY AWOKE A HORSE OF THE CABRANK
A HOOF SCOOPED ANYWAY FOR
NEW FOOTHOLD AFTER SLEEP AND HARNESS JINGLED
SLIGHTLY DISTURBED IN HIS
SENTRYBOX BY THE BRAZIER OF LIVE COKE THE WATCHER OF THE CORPORATION
STONES WHO THOUGH NOW BROKEN DOWN AND FAST BREAKING UP WAS NONE OTHER
IN STERN REALITY THAN THE GUMLEY AFORESAID NOW PRACTICALLY ON THE
PARISH RATES GIVEN THE TEMPORARY JOB BY PAT TOBIN IN ALL HUMAN
PROBABILITY FROM DICTATES OF HUMANITY KNOWING HIM BEFORE SHIFTED ABOUT
AND SHUFFLED IN HIS BOX BEFORE COMPOSING HIS LIMBS AGAIN IN TO THE ARMS
OF MORPHEUS A TRULY AMAZING PIECE OF HARD LINES IN ITS MOST VIRULENT
FORM ON A FELLOW MOST RESPECTABLY CONNECTED AND FAMILIARISED WITH DECENT
HOME COMFORTS ALL HIS LIFE WHO CAME IN FOR A COOL 100 POUNDS A YEAR
AT ONE TIME WHICH OF COURSE THE DOUBLEBARRELLED ASS PROCEEDED TO MAKE
GENERAL DUCKS AND DRAKES OF
AND THERE HE WAS AT THE END OF HIS TETHER
AFTER HAVING OFTEN PAINTED THE TOWN TOLERABLY PINK WITHOUT A BEGGARLY
STIVER
HE DRANK NEEDLESS TO BE TOLD AND IT POINTED ONLY ONCE MORE A
MORAL WHEN HE MIGHT QUITE EASILY BE IN A LARGE WAY OF BUSINESS IF A
BIG IF HOWEVER HE HAD CONTRIVED TO CURE HIMSELF OF HIS PARTICULAR
PARTIALITY
ALL MEANTIME WERE LOUDLY LAMENTING THE FALLING OFF IN IRISH SHIPPING
COASTWISE AND FOREIGN AS WELL WHICH WAS ALL PART AND PARCEL OF THE SAME
THING
A PALGRAVE MURPHY BOAT WAS PUT OFF THE WAYS AT ALEXANDRA BASIN
THE ONLY LAUNCH THAT YEAR
RIGHT ENOUGH THE HARBOURS WERE THERE ONLY NO
SHIPS EVER CALLED
THERE WERE WRECKS AND WRECKERS THE KEEPER SAID WHO WAS EVIDENTLY AU
FAIT
WHAT HE WANTED TO ASCERTAIN WAS WHY THAT SHIP RAN BANG AGAINST THE ONLY
ROCK IN GALWAY BAY WHEN THE GALWAY HARBOUR SCHEME WAS MOOTED BY A MR
WORTHINGTON OR SOME NAME LIKE THAT EH ASK THE THEN CAPTAIN HE ADVISED
THEM HOW MUCH PALMOIL THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT GAVE HIM FOR THAT DAY'S
WORK CAPTAIN JOHN LEVER OF THE LEVER LINE
AM I RIGHT SKIPPER HE QUERIED OF THE SAILOR NOW RETURNING AFTER HIS
PRIVATE POTATION AND THE REST OF HIS EXERTIONS
THAT WORTHY PICKING UP THE SCENT OF THE FAGEND OF THE SONG OR WORDS
GROWLED IN WOULDBE MUSIC BUT WITH GREAT VIM SOME KIND OF CHANTY OR OTHER
IN SECONDS OR THIRDS
MR BLOOM'S SHARP EARS HEARD HIM THEN EXPECTORATE
THE PLUG PROBABLY WHICH IT WAS SO THAT HE MUST HAVE LODGED IT FOR THE
TIME BEING IN HIS FIST WHILE HE DID THE DRINKING AND MAKING WATER JOBS
AND FOUND IT A BIT SOUR AFTER THE LIQUID FIRE IN QUESTION
ANYHOW IN
HE ROLLED AFTER HIS SUCCESSFUL LIBATION CUM POTATION INTRODUCING AN
ATMOSPHERE OF DRINK INTO THE SOIRE BOISTEROUSLY TROLLING LIKE A
VERITABLE SON OF A SEACOOK
THE BISCUITS WAS AS HARD AS BRASS
AND THE BEEF AS SALT AS LOT'S WIFE'S ARSE
O JOHNNY LEVER
JOHNNY LEVER O
AFTER WHICH EFFUSION THE REDOUBTABLE SPECIMEN DULY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE
AND REGAINING HIS SEAT HE SANK RATHER THAN SAT HEAVILY ON THE FORM
PROVIDED
SKIN THE GOAT ASSUMING HE WAS HE EVIDENTLY WITH AN AXE TO
GRIND WAS AIRING HIS GRIEVANCES IN A FORCIBLE FEEBLE PHILIPPIC ANENT
THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF IRELAND OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT WHICH HE
DESCRIBED IN HIS LENGTHY DISSERTATION AS THE RICHEST COUNTRY BAR NONE ON
THE FACE OF GOD'S EARTH FAR AND AWAY SUPERIOR TO ENGLAND WITH COAL IN
LARGE QUANTITIES SIX MILLION POUNDS WORTH OF PORK EXPORTED EVERY YEAR
TEN MILLIONS BETWEEN BUTTER AND EGGS AND ALL THE RICHES DRAINED OUT OF
IT BY ENGLAND LEVYING TAXES ON THE POOR PEOPLE THAT PAID THROUGH THE
NOSE ALWAYS AND GOBBLING UP THE BEST MEAT IN THE MARKET AND A LOT MORE
SURPLUS STEAM IN THE SAME VEIN
THEIR CONVERSATION ACCORDINGLY BECAME
GENERAL AND ALL AGREED THAT THAT WAS A FACT
YOU COULD GROW ANY MORTAL
THING IN IRISH SOIL HE STATED AND THERE WAS THAT COLONEL EVERARD DOWN
THERE IN NAVAN GROWING TOBACCO
WHERE WOULD YOU FIND ANYWHERE THE LIKE
OF IRISH BACON BUT A DAY OF RECKONING HE STATED CRESCENDO WITH NO
UNCERTAIN VOICE THOROUGHLY MONOPOLISING ALL THE CONVERSATION WAS IN
STORE FOR MIGHTY ENGLAND DESPITE HER POWER OF PELF ON ACCOUNT OF HER
CRIMES
THERE WOULD BE A FALL AND THE GREATEST FALL IN HISTORY
THE GERMANS AND THE JAPS WERE GOING TO HAVE THEIR LITTLE LOOKIN HE
AFFIRMED
THE BOERS WERE THE BEGINNING OF THE END
BRUMMAGEM ENGLAND WAS
TOPPLING ALREADY AND HER DOWNFALL WOULD BE IRELAND HER ACHILLES HEEL
WHICH HE EXPLAINED TO THEM ABOUT THE VULNERABLE POINT OF ACHILLES THE
GREEK HERO A POINT HIS AUDITORS AT ONCE SEIZED AS HE COMPLETELY GRIPPED
THEIR ATTENTION BY SHOWING THE TENDON REFERRED TO ON HIS BOOT
HIS
ADVICE TO EVERY IRISHMAN WAS STAY IN THE LAND OF YOUR BIRTH AND WORK
FOR IRELAND AND LIVE FOR IRELAND
IRELAND PARNELL SAID COULD NOT SPARE
A SINGLE ONE OF HER SONS
SILENCE ALL ROUND MARKED THE TERMINATION OF HIS FINALE
THE IMPERVIOUS
NAVIGATOR HEARD THESE LURID TIDINGS UNDISMAYED
TAKE A BIT OF DOING BOSS RETALIATED THAT ROUGH DIAMOND PALPABLY A
BIT PEEVED IN RESPONSE TO THE FOREGOING TRUISM
TO WHICH COLD DOUCHE REFERRING TO DOWNFALL AND SO ON THE KEEPER
CONCURRED BUT NEVERTHELESS HELD TO HIS MAIN VIEW
WHO'S THE BEST TROOPS IN THE ARMY THE GRIZZLED OLD VETERAN IRATELY
INTERROGATED
AND THE BEST JUMPERS AND RACERS AND THE BEST ADMIRALS AND
GENERALS WE'VE GOT TELL ME THAT
THE IRISH FOR CHOICE RETORTED THE CABBY LIKE CAMPBELL FACIAL
BLEMISHES APART
THAT'S RIGHT THE OLD TARPAULIN CORROBORATED
THE IRISH CATHOLIC
PEASANT
HE'S THE BACKBONE OF OUR EMPIRE
YOU KNOW JEM MULLINS
WHILE ALLOWING HIM HIS INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS AS EVERYMAN THE KEEPER ADDED
HE CARED NOTHING FOR ANY EMPIRE OURS OR HIS AND CONSIDERED NO IRISHMAN
WORTHY OF HIS SALT THAT SERVED IT
THEN THEY BEGAN TO HAVE A FEW
IRASCIBLE WORDS WHEN IT WAXED HOTTER BOTH NEEDLESS TO SAY APPEALING
TO THE LISTENERS WHO FOLLOWED THE PASSAGE OF ARMS WITH INTEREST SO LONG
AS THEY DIDN'T INDULGE IN RECRIMINATIONS AND COME TO BLOWS
FROM INSIDE INFORMATION EXTENDING OVER A SERIES OF YEARS MR BLOOM WAS
RATHER INCLINED TO POOHPOOH THE SUGGESTION AS EGREGIOUS BALDERDASH FOR
PENDING THAT CONSUMMATION DEVOUTLY TO BE OR NOT TO BE WISHED FOR HE WAS
FULLY COGNISANT OF THE FACT THAT THEIR NEIGHBOURS ACROSS THE CHANNEL
UNLESS THEY WERE MUCH BIGGER FOOLS THAN HE TOOK THEM FOR RATHER
CONCEALED THEIR STRENGTH THAN THE OPPOSITE
IT WAS QUITE ON A PAR WITH
THE QUIXOTIC IDEA IN CERTAIN QUARTERS THAT IN A HUNDRED MILLION YEARS
THE COAL SEAM OF THE SISTER ISLAND WOULD BE PLAYED OUT AND IF AS
TIME WENT ON THAT TURNED OUT TO BE HOW THE CAT JUMPED ALL HE COULD
PERSONALLY SAY ON THE MATTER WAS THAT AS A HOST OF CONTINGENCIES
EQUALLY RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE MIGHT OCCUR ERE THEN IT WAS HIGHLY
ADVISABLE IN THE INTERIM TO TRY TO MAKE THE MOST OF BOTH COUNTRIES EVEN
THOUGH POLES APART
ANOTHER LITTLE INTERESTING POINT THE AMOURS OF
WHORES AND CHUMMIES TO PUT IT IN COMMON PARLANCE REMINDED HIM IRISH
SOLDIERS HAD AS OFTEN FOUGHT FOR ENGLAND AS AGAINST HER MORE SO IN
FACT
AND NOW WHY SO THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PAIR OF THEM THE LICENSEE
OF THE PLACE RUMOURED TO BE OR HAVE BEEN FITZHARRIS THE FAMOUS
INVINCIBLE AND THE OTHER OBVIOUSLY BOGUS REMINDED HIM FORCIBLY AS
BEING ON ALL FOURS WITH THE CONFIDENCE TRICK SUPPOSING THAT IS IT WAS
PREARRANGED AS THE LOOKERON A STUDENT OF THE HUMAN SOUL IF ANYTHING
THE OTHERS SEEING LEAST OF THE GAME
AND AS FOR THE LESSEE OR KEEPER
WHO PROBABLY WASN'T THE OTHER PERSON AT ALL HE B COULDN'T HELP
FEELING AND MOST PROPERLY IT WAS BETTER TO GIVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT THE
GOBY UNLESS YOU WERE A BLITHERING IDIOT ALTOGETHER AND REFUSE TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM AS A GOLDEN RULE IN PRIVATE LIFE AND THEIR
FELONSETTING THERE ALWAYS BEING THE OFFCHANCE OF A DANNYMAN COMING
FORWARD AND TURNING QUEEN'S EVIDENCE OR KING'S NOW LIKE DENIS OR PETER
CAREY AN IDEA HE UTTERLY REPUDIATED
QUITE APART FROM THAT HE DISLIKED
THOSE CAREERS OF WRONGDOING AND CRIME ON PRINCIPLE
YET THOUGH SUCH
CRIMINAL PROPENSITIES HAD NEVER BEEN AN INMATE OF HIS BOSOM IN ANY
SHAPE OR FORM HE CERTAINLY DID FEEL AND NO DENYING IT WHILE INWARDLY
REMAINING WHAT HE WAS A CERTAIN KIND OF ADMIRATION FOR A MAN WHO
HAD ACTUALLY BRANDISHED A KNIFE COLD STEEL WITH THE COURAGE OF HIS
POLITICAL CONVICTIONS THOUGH PERSONALLY HE WOULD NEVER BE A PARTY TO
ANY SUCH THING OFF THE SAME BAT AS THOSE LOVE VENDETTAS OF THE SOUTH
HAVE HER OR SWING FOR HER WHEN THE HUSBAND FREQUENTLY AFTER SOME WORDS
PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO CONCERNING HER RELATIONS WITH THE OTHER LUCKY
MORTAL HE HAVING HAD THE PAIR WATCHED INFLICTED FATAL INJURIES ON
HIS ADORED ONE AS A RESULT OF AN ALTERNATIVE POSTNUPTIAL LIAISON
BY PLUNGING HIS KNIFE INTO HER UNTIL IT JUST STRUCK HIM THAT
FITZ NICKNAMED SKIN THE GOAT MERELY DROVE THE CAR FOR THE ACTUAL
PERPETRATORS OF THE OUTRAGE AND SO WAS NOT IF HE WAS RELIABLY INFORMED
ACTUALLY PARTY TO THE AMBUSH WHICH IN POINT OF FACT WAS THE PLEA SOME
LEGAL LUMINARY SAVED HIS SKIN ON
IN ANY CASE THAT WAS VERY ANCIENT
HISTORY BY NOW AND AS FOR OUR FRIEND THE PSEUDO SKIN THE ETCETERA HE
HAD TRANSPARENTLY OUTLIVED HIS WELCOME
HE OUGHT TO HAVE EITHER DIED
NATURALLY OR ON THE SCAFFOLD HIGH
LIKE ACTRESSES ALWAYS FAREWELL
POSITIVELY LAST PERFORMANCE THEN COME UP SMILING AGAIN
GENEROUS TO A
FAULT OF COURSE TEMPERAMENTAL NO ECONOMISING OR ANY IDEA OF THE SORT
ALWAYS SNAPPING AT THE BONE FOR THE SHADOW
SO SIMILARLY HE HAD A VERY
SHREWD SUSPICION THAT MR JOHNNY LEVER GOT RID OF SOME L S D
IN THE
COURSE OF HIS PERAMBULATIONS ROUND THE DOCKS IN THE CONGENIAL ATMOSPHERE
OF THE OLD IRELAND TAVERN COME BACK TO ERIN AND SO ON
THEN AS FOR
THE OTHER HE HAD HEARD NOT SO LONG BEFORE THE SAME IDENTICAL LINGO AS HE
TOLD STEPHEN HOW HE SIMPLY BUT EFFECTUALLY SILENCED THE OFFENDER
HE TOOK UMBRAGE AT SOMETHING OR OTHER THAT MUCHINJURED BUT ON THE
WHOLE EVENTEMPERED PERSON DECLARED I LET SLIP
HE CALLED ME A JEW AND
IN A HEATED FASHION OFFENSIVELY
SO I WITHOUT DEVIATING FROM PLAIN FACTS
IN THE LEAST TOLD HIM HIS GOD I MEAN CHRIST WAS A JEW TOO AND ALL HIS
FAMILY LIKE ME THOUGH IN REALITY I'M NOT
THAT WAS ONE FOR HIM
A SOFT
ANSWER TURNS AWAY WRATH
HE HADN'T A WORD TO SAY FOR HIMSELF AS EVERYONE
SAW
AM I NOT RIGHT
HE TURNED A LONG YOU ARE WRONG GAZE ON STEPHEN OF TIMOROUS DARK PRIDE
AT THE SOFT IMPEACHMENT WITH A GLANCE ALSO OF ENTREATY FOR HE SEEMED TO
GLEAN IN A KIND OF A WAY THAT IT WASN'T ALL EXACTLY
EX QUIBUS STEPHEN MUMBLED IN A NONCOMMITTAL ACCENT THEIR TWO OR
FOUR EYES CONVERSING CHRISTUS OR BLOOM HIS NAME IS OR AFTER ALL ANY
OTHER SECUNDUM CARNEM
OF COURSE MR B
PROCEEDED TO STIPULATE YOU MUST LOOK AT BOTH SIDES
OF THE QUESTION
IT IS HARD TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULES AS TO
RIGHT AND WRONG BUT ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ALL ROUND THERE CERTAINLY IS
THOUGH EVERY COUNTRY THEY SAY OUR OWN DISTRESSFUL INCLUDED HAS THE
GOVERNMENT IT DESERVES
BUT WITH A LITTLE GOODWILL ALL ROUND
IT'S ALL
VERY FINE TO BOAST OF MUTUAL SUPERIORITY BUT WHAT ABOUT MUTUAL EQUALITY
I RESENT VIOLENCE AND INTOLERANCE IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
IT NEVER
REACHES ANYTHING OR STOPS ANYTHING
A REVOLUTION MUST COME ON THE DUE
INSTALMENTS PLAN
IT'S A PATENT ABSURDITY ON THE FACE OF IT TO HATE
PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY LIVE ROUND THE CORNER AND SPEAK ANOTHER VERNACULAR
IN THE NEXT HOUSE SO TO SPEAK
MEMORABLE BLOODY BRIDGE BATTLE AND SEVEN MINUTES' WAR STEPHEN
ASSENTED BETWEEN SKINNER'S ALLEY AND ORMOND MARKET
YES MR BLOOM THOROUGHLY AGREED ENTIRELY ENDORSING THE REMARK THAT
WAS OVERWHELMINGLY RIGHT
AND THE WHOLE WORLD WAS FULL OF THAT SORT OF
THING
YOU JUST TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY MOUTH HE SAID
A HOCUSPOCUS OF
CONFLICTING EVIDENCE THAT CANDIDLY YOU COULDN'T REMOTELY
ALL THOSE WRETCHED QUARRELS IN HIS HUMBLE OPINION STIRRING UP
BAD BLOOD FROM SOME BUMP OF COMBATIVENESS OR GLAND OF SOME KIND
ERRONEOUSLY SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT A PUNCTILIO OF HONOUR AND A FLAG WERE
VERY LARGELY A QUESTION OF THE MONEY QUESTION WHICH WAS AT THE BACK OF
EVERYTHING GREED AND JEALOUSY PEOPLE NEVER KNOWING WHEN TO STOP
THEY ACCUSE REMARKED HE AUDIBLY
HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE OTHERS WHO PROBABLY AND SPOKE NEARER TO SO AS
THE OTHERS IN CASE THEY
JEWS HE SOFTLY IMPARTED IN AN ASIDE IN STEPHEN'S EAR ARE ACCUSED OF
RUINING
NOT A VESTIGE OF TRUTH IN IT I CAN SAFELY SAY
HISTORY WOULD
YOU BE SURPRISED TO LEARN PROVES UP TO THE HILT SPAIN DECAYED WHEN THE
INQUISITION HOUNDED THE JEWS OUT AND ENGLAND PROSPERED WHEN CROMWELL
AN UNCOMMONLY ABLE RUFFIAN WHO IN OTHER RESPECTS HAS MUCH TO ANSWER FOR
IMPORTED THEM
WHY BECAUSE THEY ARE IMBUED WITH THE PROPER SPIRIT
THEY
ARE PRACTICAL AND ARE PROVED TO BE SO
I DON'T WANT TO INDULGE IN ANY
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE STANDARD WORKS ON THE SUBJECT AND THEN ORTHODOX AS
YOU ARE
BUT IN THE ECONOMIC NOT TOUCHING RELIGION DOMAIN THE PRIEST
SPELLS POVERTY
SPAIN AGAIN YOU SAW IN THE WAR COMPARED WITH GOAHEAD
AMERICA
TURKS
IT'S IN THE DOGMA
BECAUSE IF THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE THEY'D
GO STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN WHEN THEY DIE THEY'D TRY TO LIVE BETTER AT LEAST
SO I THINK
THAT'S THE JUGGLE ON WHICH THE P P'S RAISE THE WIND ON FALSE
PRETENCES
I'M HE RESUMED WITH DRAMATIC FORCE AS GOOD AN IRISHMAN
AS THAT RUDE PERSON I TOLD YOU ABOUT AT THE OUTSET AND I WANT TO SEE
EVERYONE CONCLUDED HE ALL CREEDS AND CLASSES PRO RATA HAVING A
COMFORTABLE TIDYSIZED INCOME IN NO NIGGARD FASHION EITHER SOMETHING
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF 300 POUNDS PER ANNUM
THAT'S THE VITAL ISSUE
AT STAKE AND IT'S FEASIBLE AND WOULD BE PROVOCATIVE OF FRIENDLIER
INTERCOURSE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN
AT LEAST THAT'S MY IDEA FOR WHAT IT'S
WORTH
I CALL THAT PATRIOTISM
UBI PATRIA AS WE LEARNED A SMATTERING
OF IN OUR CLASSICAL DAYS IN ALMA MATER VITA BENE
WHERE YOU CAN LIVE
WELL THE SENSE IS IF YOU WORK
OVER HIS UNTASTABLE APOLOGY FOR A CUP OF COFFEE LISTENING TO THIS
SYNOPSIS OF THINGS IN GENERAL STEPHEN STARED AT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR
HE COULD HEAR OF COURSE ALL KINDS OF WORDS CHANGING COLOUR LIKE THOSE
CRABS ABOUT RINGSEND IN THE MORNING BURROWING QUICKLY INTO ALL COLOURS
OF DIFFERENT SORTS OF THE SAME SAND WHERE THEY HAD A HOME SOMEWHERE
BENEATH OR SEEMED TO
THEN HE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE EYES THAT SAID OR
DIDN'T SAY THE WORDS THE VOICE HE HEARD SAID IF YOU WORK
COUNT ME OUT HE MANAGED TO REMARK MEANING WORK
THE EYES WERE SURPRISED AT THIS OBSERVATION BECAUSE AS HE THE PERSON
WHO OWNED THEM PRO TEM
OBSERVED OR RATHER HIS VOICE SPEAKING DID ALL
MUST WORK HAVE TO TOGETHER
I MEAN OF COURSE THE OTHER HASTENED TO AFFIRM WORK IN THE WIDEST
POSSIBLE SENSE
ALSO LITERARY LABOUR NOT MERELY FOR THE KUDOS OF
THE THING
WRITING FOR THE NEWSPAPERS WHICH IS THE READIEST CHANNEL
NOWADAYS
THAT'S WORK TOO
IMPORTANT WORK
AFTER ALL FROM THE LITTLE
I KNOW OF YOU AFTER ALL THE MONEY EXPENDED ON YOUR EDUCATION YOU ARE
ENTITLED TO RECOUP YOURSELF AND COMMAND YOUR PRICE
YOU HAVE EVERY BIT
AS MUCH RIGHT TO LIVE BY YOUR PEN IN PURSUIT OF YOUR PHILOSOPHY AS THE
PEASANT HAS
WHAT YOU BOTH BELONG TO IRELAND THE BRAIN AND THE BRAWN
EACH IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT
YOU SUSPECT STEPHEN RETORTED WITH A SORT OF A HALF LAUGH THAT I MAY
BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE I BELONG TO THE FAUBOURG SAINT PATRICE CALLED
IRELAND FOR SHORT
I WOULD GO A STEP FARTHER MR BLOOM INSINUATED
BUT I SUSPECT STEPHEN INTERRUPTED THAT IRELAND MUST BE IMPORTANT
BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO ME
WHAT BELONGS QUERIED MR BLOOM BENDING FANCYING HE WAS PERHAPS UNDER
SOME MISAPPREHENSION
EXCUSE ME
UNFORTUNATELY I DIDN'T CATCH THE
LATTER PORTION
WHAT WAS IT YOU
STEPHEN PATENTLY CROSSTEMPERED REPEATED AND SHOVED ASIDE HIS MUG OF
COFFEE OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO CALL IT NONE TOO POLITELY ADDING 1170
WE CAN'T CHANGE THE COUNTRY
LET US CHANGE THE SUBJECT
AT THIS PERTINENT SUGGESTION MR BLOOM TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT LOOKED
DOWN BUT IN A QUANDARY AS HE COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHAT CONSTRUCTION
TO PUT ON BELONGS TO WHICH SOUNDED RATHER A FAR CRY
THE REBUKE OF SOME
KIND WAS CLEARER THAN THE OTHER PART
NEEDLESS TO SAY THE FUMES OF
HIS RECENT ORGY SPOKE THEN WITH SOME ASPERITY IN A CURIOUS BITTER WAY
FOREIGN TO HIS SOBER STATE
PROBABLY THE HOMELIFE TO WHICH MR B ATTACHED
THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE HAD NOT BEEN ALL THAT WAS NEEDFUL OR HE HADN'T
BEEN FAMILIARISED WITH THE RIGHT SORT OF PEOPLE
WITH A TOUCH OF FEAR
FOR THE YOUNG MAN BESIDE HIM WHOM HE FURTIVELY SCRUTINISED WITH AN AIR
OF SOME CONSTERNATION REMEMBERING HE HAD JUST COME BACK FROM PARIS
THE EYES MORE ESPECIALLY REMINDING HIM FORCIBLY OF FATHER AND SISTER
FAILING TO THROW MUCH LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER HE BROUGHT TO MIND
INSTANCES OF CULTURED FELLOWS THAT PROMISED SO BRILLIANTLY NIPPED IN THE
BUD OF PREMATURE DECAY AND NOBODY TO BLAME BUT THEMSELVES
FOR INSTANCE
THERE WAS THE CASE OF O'CALLAGHAN FOR ONE THE HALFCRAZY FADDIST
RESPECTABLY CONNECTED THOUGH OF INADEQUATE MEANS WITH HIS MAD VAGARIES
AMONG WHOSE OTHER GAY DOINGS WHEN ROTTO AND MAKING HIMSELF A NUISANCE
TO EVERYBODY ALL ROUND HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF OSTENTATIOUSLY SPORTING IN
PUBLIC A SUIT OF BROWN PAPER A FACT
AND THEN THE USUAL DENOUEMENT
AFTER THE FUN HAD GONE ON FAST AND FURIOUS HE GOT 1190 LANDED INTO HOT
WATER AND HAD TO BE SPIRITED AWAY BY A FEW FRIENDS AFTER A STRONG HINT
TO A BLIND HORSE FROM JOHN MALLON OF LOWER CASTLE YARD SO AS NOT TO
BE MADE AMENABLE UNDER SECTION TWO OF THE CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT ACT
CERTAIN NAMES OF THOSE SUBPOENAED BEING HANDED IN BUT NOT DIVULGED
FOR REASONS WHICH WILL OCCUR TO ANYONE WITH A PICK OF BRAINS
BRIEFLY
PUTTING TWO AND TWO TOGETHER SIX SIXTEEN WHICH HE POINTEDLY TURNED A
DEAF EAR TO ANTONIO AND SO FORTH JOCKEYS AND ESTHETES AND THE TATTOO
WHICH WAS ALL THE GO IN THE SEVENTIES OR THEREABOUTS EVEN IN THE HOUSE
OF LORDS BECAUSE EARLY IN LIFE THE OCCUPANT OF THE THRONE THEN HEIR
APPARENT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE UPPER TEN AND OTHER HIGH PERSONAGES
SIMPLY FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE HEAD OF THE STATE HE REFLECTED
ABOUT THE ERRORS OF NOTORIETIES AND CROWNED HEADS RUNNING COUNTER TO
MORALITY SUCH AS THE CORNWALL CASE A NUMBER OF YEARS BEFORE UNDER THEIR
VENEER IN A WAY SCARCELY INTENDED BY NATURE A THING GOOD MRS GRUNDY
AS THE LAW STANDS WAS TERRIBLY DOWN ON THOUGH NOT FOR THE REASON THEY
THOUGHT THEY WERE PROBABLY WHATEVER IT WAS EXCEPT WOMEN CHIEFLY WHO WERE
ALWAYS FIDDLING MORE OR LESS AT ONE ANOTHER IT BEING LARGELY A MATTER OF
DRESS AND ALL THE REST OF IT
LADIES WHO LIKE DISTINCTIVE UNDERCLOTHING
SHOULD AND EVERY WELLTAILORED MAN MUST TRYING TO MAKE THE GAP WIDER
BETWEEN THEM BY INNUENDO AND GIVE MORE OF A GENUINE FILIP TO ACTS OF
IMPROPRIETY BETWEEN THE TWO SHE UNBUTTONED HIS AND THEN HE UNTIED HER
MIND THE PIN WHEREAS SAVAGES IN THE CANNIBAL ISLANDS SAY AT NINETY
DEGREES IN THE SHADE NOT CARING A CONTINENTAL
HOWEVER REVERTING TO THE
ORIGINAL THERE WERE ON THE OTHER HAND OTHERS WHO HAD FORCED THEIR WAY
TO THE TOP FROM THE LOWEST RUNG BY THE AID OF THEIR BOOTSTRAPS
SHEER
FORCE OF NATURAL GENIUS THAT
WITH BRAINS SIR
FOR WHICH AND FURTHER REASONS HE FELT IT WAS HIS INTEREST AND DUTY EVEN
TO WAIT ON AND PROFIT BY THE UNLOOKEDFOR OCCASION THOUGH WHY HE COULD
NOT EXACTLY TELL BEING AS IT WAS ALREADY SEVERAL SHILLINGS TO THE
BAD HAVING IN FACT LET HIMSELF IN FOR IT
STILL TO CULTIVATE THE
ACQUAINTANCE OF SOMEONE OF NO UNCOMMON CALIBRE WHO COULD PROVIDE FOOD
FOR REFLECTION WOULD AMPLY REPAY ANY SMALL
INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION
AS SUCH WAS HE FELT FROM TIME TO TIME A FIRSTRATE TONIC FOR THE MIND

THOUGH
THAT HALFBAKED LYONS RAN OFF AT A TANGENT IN HIS IMPETUOSITY TO GET

OF COURSE GAMBLING EMINENTLY LENT ITSELF TO THAT SORT OF THING
THOUGH AS THE EVENT TURNED OUT THE POOR FOOL HADN'T MUCH REASON TO
CONGRATULATE HIMSELF ON HIS PICK THE FORLORN HOPE
GUESSWORK IT REDUCED
ITSELF TO EVENTUALLY
THERE WAS EVERY INDICATION THEY WOULD ARRIVE AT THAT HE BLOOM SAID
WHO THE OTHER WHOSE HAND BY THE WAY WAS HURT SAID
ONE MORNING YOU WOULD OPEN THE PAPER THE CABMAN AFFIRMED AND READ
RETURN OF PARNELL
HE BET THEM WHAT THEY LIKED
A DUBLIN FUSILIER WAS
IN THAT SHELTER ONE NIGHT AND SAID HE SAW HIM IN SOUTH AFRICA
PRIDE IT
WAS KILLED HIM
HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE AWAY WITH HIMSELF OR LAIN LOW FOR
A TIME AFTER COMMITTEE ROOM NO 15 UNTIL HE WAS HIS OLD SELF AGAIN WITH
NO ONE TO POINT A FINGER AT HIM
THEN THEY WOULD ALL TO A MAN HAVE GONE
DOWN ON THEIR MARROWBONES TO HIM TO COME BACK WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED
HIS SENSES
DEAD HE WASN'T
SIMPLY ABSCONDED SOMEWHERE
THE COFFIN THEY
BROUGHT OVER WAS FULL OF STONES
HE CHANGED HIS NAME TO DE WET THE BOER
GENERAL
HE MADE A MISTAKE TO FIGHT THE PRIESTS
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON
ALL THE SAME BLOOM PROPERLY SO DUBBED WAS RATHER SURPRISED AT THEIR
MEMORIES FOR IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN IT WAS A CASE OF TARBARRELS AND
NOT SINGLY BUT IN THEIR THOUSANDS AND THEN COMPLETE OBLIVION BECAUSE IT
WAS TWENTY ODD YEARS
HIGHLY UNLIKELY OF COURSE THERE WAS EVEN A SHADOW
OF TRUTH IN THE STONES AND EVEN SUPPOSING HE THOUGHT A RETURN HIGHLY
INADVISABLE ALL THINGS CONSIDERED
SOMETHING EVIDENTLY RILED THEM IN
HIS DEATH
EITHER HE PETERED OUT TOO TAMELY OF ACUTE PNEUMONIA JUST WHEN
HIS VARIOUS DIFFERENT POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS WERE NEARING COMPLETION
OR WHETHER IT TRANSPIRED HE OWED HIS DEATH TO HIS HAVING NEGLECTED TO
CHANGE HIS BOOTS AND CLOTHES AFTER A WETTING WHEN A COLD RESULTED AND
FAILING TO CONSULT A SPECIALIST HE BEING CONFINED TO HIS ROOM TILL HE
EVENTUALLY DIED OF IT AMID WIDESPREAD REGRET BEFORE A FORTNIGHT WAS AT
AN END OR QUITE POSSIBLY THEY WERE DISTRESSED TO FIND THE JOB WAS TAKEN
OUT OF THEIR HANDS
OF COURSE NOBODY BEING ACQUAINTED WITH HIS MOVEMENTS
EVEN BEFORE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE AS TO HIS WHEREABOUTS WHICH
WERE DECIDEDLY OF THE ALICE WHERE ART THOU ORDER EVEN PRIOR TO HIS
STARTING TO GO UNDER SEVERAL ALIASES SUCH AS FOX AND STEWART SO THE
REMARK WHICH EMANATED FROM FRIEND CABBY MIGHT BE WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF
POSSIBILITY
NATURALLY THEN IT WOULD PREY ON HIS MIND AS A BORN LEADER
OF MEN WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY HE WAS AND A COMMANDING FIGURE A SIXFOOTER
OR AT ANY RATE FIVE FEET TEN OR ELEVEN IN HIS STOCKINGED FEET WHEREAS
MESSRS SO AND SO WHO THOUGH THEY WEREN'T EVEN A PATCH ON THE FORMER
MAN RULED THE ROOST AFTER THEIR REDEEMING FEATURES WERE VERY FEW AND
FAR BETWEEN
IT CERTAINLY POINTED A MORAL THE IDOL WITH FEET OF CLAY
AND THEN SEVENTYTWO OF HIS TRUSTY HENCHMEN ROUNDING ON HIM WITH MUTUAL
MUDSLINGING
AND THE IDENTICAL SAME WITH MURDERERS
YOU HAD TO COME
BACK
THAT HAUNTING SENSE KIND OF DREW YOU
TO SHOW THE UNDERSTUDY IN
THE TITLE RLE HOW TO
HE SAW HIM ONCE ON THE AUSPICIOUS OCCASION
WHEN THEY BROKE UP THE TYPE IN THE INSUPPRESSIBLE OR WAS IT UNITED
IRELAND A PRIVILEGE HE KEENLY APPRECIATED AND IN POINT OF FACT
HANDED HIM HIS SILK HAT WHEN IT WAS KNOCKED OFF AND HE SAID THANK YOU
EXCITED AS HE UNDOUBTEDLY WAS UNDER HIS FRIGID EXTERIOR NOTWITHSTANDING
THE LITTLE MISADVENTURE MENTIONED BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LIP WHAT'S
BRED IN THE BONE
STILL AS REGARDS RETURN
YOU WERE A LUCKY DOG IF
THEY DIDN'T SET THE TERRIER AT YOU DIRECTLY YOU GOT BACK
THEN A LOT OF
SHILLYSHALLY USUALLY FOLLOWED TOM FOR AND DICK AND HARRY AGAINST
AND
THEN NUMBER ONE YOU CAME UP AGAINST THE MAN IN POSSESSION AND HAD TO
PRODUCE YOUR CREDENTIALS LIKE THE CLAIMANT IN THE TICHBORNE CASE
ROGER CHARLES TICHBORNE BELLA WAS THE BOAT'S NAME TO THE BEST OF HIS
RECOLLECTION HE THE HEIR WENT DOWN IN AS THE EVIDENCE WENT TO SHOW
AND THERE WAS A TATTOO MARK TOO IN INDIAN INK LORD BELLEW WAS IT AS HE
MIGHT VERY EASILY HAVE PICKED UP THE DETAILS FROM SOME PAL ON BOARD SHIP
AND THEN WHEN GOT UP TO TALLY WITH THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN INTRODUCE
HIMSELF WITH EXCUSE ME MY NAME IS SO AND SO OR SOME SUCH COMMONPLACE
REMARK
A MORE PRUDENT COURSE AS BLOOM SAID TO THE NOT OVER EFFUSIVE
IN FACT LIKE THE DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGE UNDER DISCUSSION BESIDE HIM
WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SOUND THE LIE OF THE LAND FIRST
THAT BITCH THAT ENGLISH WHORE DID FOR HIM THE SHEBEEN PROPRIETOR
COMMENTED
SHE PUT THE FIRST NAIL IN HIS COFFIN
FINE LUMP OF A WOMAN ALL THE SAME THE SOI DISANT TOWNCLERK HENRY
CAMPBELL REMARKED AND PLENTY OF HER
SHE LOOSENED MANY A MAN'S THIGHS
I SEEN HER PICTURE IN A BARBER'S
THE HUSBAND WAS A CAPTAIN OR AN
OFFICER
AY SKIN THE GOAT AMUSINGLY ADDED HE WAS AND A COTTONBALL ONE
THIS GRATUITOUS CONTRIBUTION OF A HUMOROUS CHARACTER OCCASIONED A FAIR
AMOUNT OF LAUGHTER AMONG HIS ENTOURAGE
AS REGARDS BLOOM HE WITHOUT
THE FAINTEST SUSPICION OF A SMILE MERELY GAZED IN THE DIRECTION OF
THE DOOR AND REFLECTED UPON THE HISTORIC STORY WHICH HAD AROUSED
EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST AT THE TIME WHEN THE FACTS TO MAKE MATTERS
WORSE WERE MADE PUBLIC WITH THE USUAL AFFECTIONATE LETTERS THAT PASSED
BETWEEN THEM FULL OF SWEET NOTHINGS
FIRST IT WAS STRICTLY PLATONIC TILL
NATURE INTERVENED AND AN ATTACHMENT SPRANG UP BETWEEN THEM TILL BIT BY
BIT MATTERS CAME TO A CLIMAX AND THE MATTER BECAME THE TALK OF THE TOWN
TILL THE STAGGERING BLOW CAME AS A WELCOME INTELLIGENCE TO NOT A FEW
EVILDISPOSED HOWEVER WHO WERE RESOLVED UPON ENCOMPASSING HIS DOWNFALL
THOUGH THE THING WAS PUBLIC PROPERTY ALL ALONG THOUGH NOT TO ANYTHING
LIKE THE SENSATIONAL EXTENT THAT IT SUBSEQUENTLY BLOSSOMED INTO
SINCE
THEIR NAMES WERE COUPLED THOUGH SINCE HE WAS HER DECLARED FAVOURITE
WHERE WAS THE PARTICULAR NECESSITY TO PROCLAIM IT TO THE RANK AND FILE
FROM THE HOUSETOPS THE FACT NAMELY THAT HE HAD SHARED HER BEDROOM
WHICH CAME OUT IN THE WITNESSBOX ON OATH WHEN A THRILL WENT THROUGH THE
PACKED COURT LITERALLY ELECTRIFYING EVERYBODY IN THE SHAPE OF WITNESSES
SWEARING TO HAVING WITNESSED HIM ON SUCH AND SUCH A PARTICULAR DATE IN
THE ACT OF SCRAMBLING OUT OF AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT WITH THE ASSISTANCE
OF A LADDER IN NIGHT APPAREL HAVING GAINED ADMITTANCE IN THE SAME
FASHION A FACT THE WEEKLIES ADDICTED TO THE LUBRIC A LITTLE SIMPLY
COINED SHOALS OF MONEY OUT OF
WHEREAS THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE CASE WAS
IT WAS SIMPLY A CASE OF THE HUSBAND NOT BEING UP TO THE SCRATCH WITH
NOTHING IN COMMON BETWEEN THEM BEYOND THE NAME AND THEN A REAL MAN
ARRIVING ON THE SCENE STRONG TO THE VERGE OF WEAKNESS FALLING A VICTIM
TO HER SIREN CHARMS AND FORGETTING HOME TIES THE USUAL SEQUEL TO BASK
IN THE LOVED ONE'S SMILES
THE ETERNAL QUESTION OF THE LIFE CONNUBIAL
NEEDLESS TO SAY CROPPED UP
CAN REAL LOVE SUPPOSING THERE HAPPENS TO
BE ANOTHER CHAP IN THE CASE EXIST BETWEEN MARRIED FOLK POSER
THOUGH IT WAS NO CONCERN OF THEIRS ABSOLUTELY IF HE REGARDED HER WITH
AFFECTION CARRIED AWAY BY A WAVE OF FOLLY
A MAGNIFICENT SPECIMEN OF
MANHOOD HE WAS TRULY AUGMENTED OBVIOUSLY BY GIFTS OF A HIGH ORDER AS
COMPARED WITH THE OTHER MILITARY SUPERNUMERARY THAT IS WHO WAS JUST THE
USUAL EVERYDAY FAREWELL MY GALLANT CAPTAIN KIND OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN
THE LIGHT DRAGOONS THE 18TH HUSSARS TO BE ACCURATE AND INFLAMMABLE
DOUBTLESS THE FALLEN LEADER THAT IS NOT THE OTHER IN HIS OWN
PECULIAR WAY WHICH SHE OF COURSE WOMAN QUICKLY PERCEIVED AS HIGHLY
LIKELY TO CARVE HIS WAY TO FAME WHICH HE ALMOST BID FAIR TO DO TILL THE
PRIESTS AND MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL AS A WHOLE HIS ERSTWHILE STAUNCH
ADHERENTS AND HIS BELOVED EVICTED TENANTS FOR WHOM HE HAD DONE YEOMAN
SERVICE IN THE RURAL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BY TAKING UP THE CUDGELS ON
THEIR BEHALF IN A WAY THAT EXCEEDED THEIR MOST SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS
VERY EFFECTUALLY COOKED HIS MATRIMONIAL GOOSE THEREBY HEAPING COALS OF
FIRE ON HIS HEAD MUCH IN THE SAME WAY AS THE FABLED ASS'S KICK
LOOKING
BACK NOW IN A RETROSPECTIVE KIND OF ARRANGEMENT ALL SEEMED A KIND OF
DREAM
AND THEN COMING BACK WAS THE WORST THING YOU EVER DID BECAUSE IT
WENT WITHOUT SAYING YOU WOULD FEEL OUT OF PLACE AS THINGS ALWAYS MOVED
WITH THE TIMES
WHY AS HE REFLECTED IRISHTOWN STRAND A LOCALITY HE
HAD NOT BEEN IN FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS LOOKED DIFFERENT SOMEHOW
SINCE AS IT HAPPENED HE WENT TO RESIDE ON THE NORTH SIDE
NORTH OR
SOUTH HOWEVER IT WAS JUST THE WELLKNOWN CASE OF HOT PASSION PURE AND
SIMPLE UPSETTING THE APPLECART WITH A VENGEANCE AND JUST BORE OUT THE
VERY THING HE WAS SAYING AS SHE ALSO WAS SPANISH OR HALF SO TYPES THAT
WOULDN'T DO THINGS BY HALVES PASSIONATE ABANDON OF THE SOUTH CASTING
EVERY SHRED OF DECENCY TO THE WINDS
JUST BEARS OUT WHAT I WAS SAYING HE WITH GLOWING BOSOM SAID TO
STEPHEN ABOUT BLOOD AND THE SUN
AND IF I DON'T GREATLY MISTAKE SHE
WAS SPANISH TOO
THE KING OF SPAIN'S DAUGHTER STEPHEN ANSWERED ADDING SOMETHING OR
OTHER RATHER MUDDLED ABOUT FAREWELL AND ADIEU TO YOU SPANISH ONIONS AND
THE FIRST LAND CALLED THE DEADMAN AND FROM RAMHEAD TO SCILLY WAS SO AND
SO MANY
WAS SHE BLOOM EJACULATED SURPRISED THOUGH NOT ASTONISHED BY ANY
MEANS I NEVER HEARD THAT RUMOUR BEFORE
POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY THERE IT
WAS AS SHE LIVED THERE
SO SPAIN
CAREFULLY AVOIDING A BOOK IN HIS POCKET SWEETS OF WHICH REMINDED HIM
BY THE BY OF THAT CAP L STREET LIBRARY BOOK OUT OF DATE HE TOOK OUT HIS
POCKETBOOK AND TURNING OVER THE VARIOUS CONTENTS IT CONTAINED RAPIDLY
FINALLY HE
DO YOU CONSIDER BY THE BY HE SAID THOUGHTFULLY SELECTING A FADED
PHOTO WHICH HE LAID ON THE TABLE THAT A SPANISH TYPE
STEPHEN OBVIOUSLY ADDRESSED LOOKED DOWN ON THE PHOTO SHOWING A LARGE
SIZED LADY WITH HER FLESHY CHARMS ON EVIDENCE IN AN OPEN FASHION AS SHE
WAS IN THE FULL BLOOM OF WOMANHOOD IN EVENING DRESS CUT OSTENTATIOUSLY
LOW FOR THE OCCASION TO GIVE A LIBERAL DISPLAY OF BOSOM WITH MORE THAN
VISION OF BREASTS HER FULL LIPS PARTED AND SOME PERFECT TEETH STANDING
NEAR OSTENSIBLY WITH GRAVITY A PIANO ON THE REST OF WHICH WAS IN OLD
MADRID A BALLAD PRETTY IN ITS WAY WHICH WAS THEN ALL THE VOGUE
HER
THE LADY'S EYES DARK LARGE LOOKED AT STEPHEN ABOUT TO SMILE ABOUT
SOMETHING TO BE ADMIRED LAFAYETTE OF WESTMORELAND STREET DUBLIN'S
PREMIER PHOTOGRAPHIC ARTIST BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTHETIC
EXECUTION
MRS BLOOM MY WIFE THE PRIMA DONNA MADAM MARION TWEEDY BLOOM
INDICATED
TAKEN A FEW YEARS SINCE
IN OR ABOUT NINETY SIX
VERY LIKE
HER THEN
BESIDE THE YOUNG MAN HE LOOKED ALSO AT THE PHOTO OF THE LADY NOW HIS
1440 LEGAL WIFE WHO HE INTIMATED WAS THE ACCOMPLISHED DAUGHTER OF
MAJOR BRIAN TWEEDY AND DISPLAYED AT AN EARLY AGE REMARKABLE PROFICIENCY
AS A SINGER HAVING EVEN MADE HER BOW TO THE PUBLIC WHEN HER YEARS
NUMBERED BARELY SWEET SIXTEEN
AS FOR THE FACE IT WAS A SPEAKING
LIKENESS IN EXPRESSION BUT IT DID NOT DO JUSTICE TO HER FIGURE WHICH
CAME IN FOR A LOT OF NOTICE USUALLY AND WHICH DID NOT COME OUT TO THE
BEST ADVANTAGE IN THAT GETUP
SHE COULD WITHOUT DIFFICULTY HE SAID
HAVE POSED FOR THE ENSEMBLE NOT TO DWELL ON CERTAIN OPULENT CURVES OF
THE
HE DWELT BEING A BIT OF AN ARTIST IN HIS SPARE TIME ON THE FEMALE
FORM IN GENERAL DEVELOPMENTALLY BECAUSE AS IT SO HAPPENED NO LATER
THAN THAT AFTERNOON HE HAD SEEN THOSE GRECIAN STATUES 1450 PERFECTLY
DEVELOPED AS WORKS OF ART IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM
MARBLE COULD GIVE
THE ORIGINAL SHOULDERS BACK ALL THE SYMMETRY ALL THE REST
YES
PURITANISME IT DOES THOUGH SAINT JOSEPH'S SOVEREIGN THIEVERY ALORS
BANDEZ FIGNE TOI TROP
WHEREAS NO PHOTO COULD BECAUSE IT SIMPLY
WASN'T ART IN A WORD
THE SPIRIT MOVING HIM HE WOULD MUCH HAVE LIKED TO FOLLOW JACK TAR'S GOOD
EXAMPLE AND LEAVE THE LIKENESS THERE FOR A VERY FEW MINUTES TO SPEAK FOR
ITSELF ON THE PLEA HE SO THAT THE OTHER COULD DRINK IN THE BEAUTY FOR
HIMSELF HER STAGE PRESENCE BEING FRANKLY A TREAT IN ITSELF WHICH THE
CAMERA COULD NOT AT ALL DO JUSTICE TO
BUT IT WAS SCARCELY PROFESSIONAL
ETIQUETTE SO
THOUGH IT WAS A WARM PLEASANT SORT OF A NIGHT NOW YET
WONDERFULLY COOL FOR THE SEASON CONSIDERING FOR SUNSHINE AFTER STORM
AND HE DID FEEL A KIND OF NEED THERE AND THEN TO FOLLOW SUIT LIKE A
KIND OF INWARD VOICE AND SATISFY A POSSIBLE NEED BY MOVING A MOTION
NEVERTHELESS HE SAT TIGHT JUST VIEWING THE SLIGHTLY SOILED PHOTO CREASED
BY OPULENT CURVES NONE THE WORSE FOR WEAR HOWEVER AND LOOKED AWAY
THOUGHTFULLY WITH THE INTENTION OF NOT FURTHER INCREASING THE
OTHER'S POSSIBLE EMBARRASSMENT WHILE GAUGING HER SYMMETRY OF HEAVING
EMBONPOINT
IN FACT THE SLIGHT SOILING WAS ONLY AN ADDED CHARM LIKE
THE CASE OF LINEN SLIGHTLY SOILED GOOD AS NEW MUCH BETTER IN FACT
WITH THE STARCH OUT
SUPPOSE SHE WAS GONE WHEN HE I LOOKED FOR THE LAMP
WHICH SHE TOLD ME CAME INTO HIS MIND BUT MERELY AS A PASSING FANCY OF
HIS BECAUSE HE THEN RECOLLECTED THE MORNING LITTERED BED ETCETERA AND
THE BOOK ABOUT RUBY WITH MET HIM PIKE HOSES SIC IN IT WHICH MUST
HAVE FELL DOWN SUFFICIENTLY APPROPRIATELY BESIDE THE DOMESTIC CHAMBERPOT
WITH APOLOGIES TO LINDLEY MURRAY
THE VICINITY OF THE YOUNG MAN HE CERTAINLY RELISHED EDUCATED
DISTINGU AND IMPULSIVE INTO THE BARGAIN FAR AND AWAY THE PICK OF THE
BUNCH THOUGH YOU WOULDN'T THINK HE HAD IT IN HIM YET YOU WOULD
BESIDES
HE SAID THE PICTURE WAS HANDSOME WHICH SAY WHAT YOU LIKE IT WAS THOUGH
AT THE MOMENT SHE WAS DISTINCTLY STOUTER
AND WHY NOT AN AWFUL LOT OF
MAKEBELIEVE WENT ON ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING INVOLVING A LIFELONG SLUR
WITH THE USUAL SPLASH PAGE OF GUTTERPRESS ABOUT THE SAME OLD MATRIMONIAL
TANGLE ALLEGING MISCONDUCT WITH PROFESSIONAL GOLFER OR THE NEWEST
STAGE FAVOURITE INSTEAD OF BEING HONEST AND ABOVEBOARD ABOUT THE WHOLE
BUSINESS
HOW THEY WERE FATED TO MEET AND AN ATTACHMENT SPRANG UP
BETWEEN THE TWO SO THAT THEIR NAMES WERE COUPLED IN THE PUBLIC EYE
WAS TOLD IN COURT WITH LETTERS CONTAINING THE HABITUAL MUSHY AND
COMPROMISING EXPRESSIONS LEAVING NO LOOPHOLE TO SHOW THAT THEY OPENLY
COHABITED TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK AT SOME WELLKNOWN SEASIDE HOTEL AND
RELATIONS WHEN THE THING RAN ITS NORMAL COURSE BECAME IN DUE COURSE
INTIMATE
THEN THE DECREE NISI AND THE KING'S PROCTOR TRIES TO SHOW
CAUSE WHY AND HE FAILING TO QUASH IT NISI WAS MADE ABSOLUTE
BUT AS
FOR THAT THE TWO MISDEMEANANTS WRAPPED UP AS THEY LARGELY WERE IN ONE
ANOTHER COULD SAFELY AFFORD TO IGNORE IT AS THEY VERY LARGELY DID TILL
THE MATTER WAS PUT IN THE HANDS OF A SOLICITOR WHO FILED A PETITION FOR
THE PARTY WRONGED IN DUE COURSE
HE B ENJOYED THE DISTINCTION OF BEING
CLOSE TO ERIN'S UNCROWNED KING IN THE FLESH WHEN THE THING OCCURRED ON
THE HISTORIC FRACAS WHEN THE FALLEN LEADER'S WHO NOTORIOUSLY STUCK TO
HIS GUNS TO THE LAST DROP EVEN WHEN CLOTHED IN THE MANTLE OF ADULTERY
LEADER'S TRUSTY HENCHMEN TO THE NUMBER OF TEN OR A DOZEN OR
POSSIBLY EVEN MORE THAN THAT PENETRATED INTO THE PRINTING WORKS OF THE
INSUPPRESSIBLE OR NO IT WAS UNITED IRELAND A BY NO MEANS BY THE
BY APPROPRIATE APPELLATIVE AND BROKE UP THE TYPECASES WITH HAMMERS OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ALL ON ACCOUNT OF SOME SCURRILOUS EFFUSIONS FROM
THE FACILE PENS OF THE O'BRIENITE SCRIBES AT THE USUAL MUDSLINGING
OCCUPATION REFLECTING ON THE ERSTWHILE TRIBUNE'S PRIVATE MORALS
THOUGH
PALPABLY A RADICALLY ALTERED MAN HE WAS STILL A COMMANDING FIGURE THOUGH
CARELESSLY GARBED AS USUAL WITH THAT LOOK OF SETTLED PURPOSE WHICH WENT
A LONG WAY WITH THE SHILLYSHALLYERS TILL THEY DISCOVERED TO THEIR VAST
DISCOMFITURE THAT THEIR IDOL HAD FEET OF CLAY AFTER PLACING HIM UPON A
PEDESTAL WHICH SHE HOWEVER WAS THE FIRST TO PERCEIVE
AS THOSE WERE
PARTICULARLY HOT TIMES IN THE GENERAL HULLABALLOO BLOOM SUSTAINED A
MINOR INJURY FROM A NASTY PROD OF SOME CHAP'S ELBOW IN THE CROWD THAT
OF COURSE CONGREGATED LODGING SOME PLACE ABOUT THE PIT OF THE STOMACH
FORTUNATELY NOT OF A GRAVE CHARACTER
HIS HAT PARNELL'S A SILK ONE WAS
INADVERTENTLY KNOCKED OFF AND AS A MATTER OF STRICT HISTORY BLOOM WAS
THE MAN WHO PICKED IT UP IN THE CRUSH AFTER WITNESSING THE OCCURRENCE
MEANING TO RETURN IT TO HIM AND RETURN IT TO HIM HE DID WITH THE UTMOST
CELERITY WHO PANTING AND HATLESS AND WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE MILES AWAY
FROM HIS HAT AT THE TIME ALL THE SAME BEING A GENTLEMAN BORN WITH A
STAKE IN THE COUNTRY HE AS A MATTER OF FACT HAVING GONE INTO IT MORE
FOR THE KUDOS OF THE THING THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHAT'S BRED IN THE BONE
INSTILLED INTO HIM IN INFANCY AT HIS MOTHER'S KNEE IN THE SHAPE OF
KNOWING WHAT GOOD FORM WAS CAME OUT AT ONCE BECAUSE HE TURNED ROUND TO
THE DONOR AND THANKED HIM WITH PERFECT APLOMB SAYING THANK YOU
SIR THOUGH IN A VERY DIFFERENT TONE OF VOICE FROM THE ORNAMENT OF THE
LEGAL PROFESSION WHOSE HEADGEAR BLOOM ALSO SET TO RIGHTS EARLIER IN THE
COURSE OF THE DAY HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF WITH A DIFFERENCE AFTER
THE BURIAL OF A MUTUAL FRIEND WHEN THEY HAD LEFT HIM ALONE IN HIS GLORY
AFTER THE GRIM TASK OF HAVING COMMITTED HIS REMAINS TO THE GRAVE
ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT INCENSED HIM MORE INWARDLY WAS THE BLATANT JOKES
OF THE CABMAN AND SO ON WHO PASSED IT ALL OFF AS A JEST LAUGHING 1530
IMMODERATELY PRETENDING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THE WHY AND THE
WHEREFORE AND IN REALITY NOT KNOWING THEIR OWN MINDS IT BEING A CASE
FOR THE TWO PARTIES THEMSELVES UNLESS IT ENSUED THAT THE LEGITIMATE
HUSBAND HAPPENED TO BE A PARTY TO IT OWING TO SOME ANONYMOUS LETTER FROM
THE USUAL BOY JONES WHO HAPPENED TO COME ACROSS THEM AT THE CRUCIAL
MOMENT IN A LOVING POSITION LOCKED IN ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS DRAWING
ATTENTION TO THEIR ILLICIT PROCEEDINGS AND LEADING UP TO A DOMESTIC
RUMPUS AND THE ERRING FAIR ONE BEGGING FORGIVENESS OF HER LORD AND
MASTER UPON HER KNEES AND PROMISING TO SEVER THE CONNECTION AND NOT
RECEIVE HIS VISITS ANY MORE IF ONLY THE AGGRIEVED HUSBAND WOULD OVERLOOK
THE MATTER AND LET BYGONES BE BYGONES WITH TEARS IN HER EYES THOUGH
POSSIBLY WITH HER TONGUE IN HER FAIR CHEEK AT THE SAME TIME AS QUITE
POSSIBLY THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHERS
HE PERSONALLY BEING OF A SCEPTICAL
BIAS BELIEVED AND DIDN'T MAKE THE SMALLEST BONES ABOUT SAYING SO EITHER
THAT MAN OR MEN IN THE PLURAL WERE ALWAYS HANGING AROUND ON THE WAITING
LIST ABOUT A LADY EVEN SUPPOSING SHE WAS THE BEST WIFE IN THE WORLD
AND THEY GOT ON FAIRLY WELL TOGETHER FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT WHEN
NEGLECTING HER DUTIES SHE CHOSE TO BE TIRED OF WEDDED LIFE AND WAS ON
FOR A LITTLE FLUTTER IN POLITE DEBAUCHERY TO PRESS THEIR ATTENTIONS ON
HER WITH IMPROPER INTENT THE UPSHOT BEING THAT HER AFFECTIONS CENTRED
ON ANOTHER THE CAUSE OF MANY LIAISONS BETWEEN STILL ATTRACTIVE
MARRIED WOMEN GETTING ON FOR FAIR AND FORTY AND YOUNGER MEN NO DOUBT AS
SEVERAL FAMOUS CASES OF FEMININE INFATUATION PROVED UP TO THE HILT
IT WAS A THOUSAND PITIES A YOUNG FELLOW BLESSED WITH AN ALLOWANCE OF
BRAINS AS HIS NEIGHBOUR OBVIOUSLY WAS SHOULD WASTE HIS VALUABLE TIME
WITH PROFLIGATE WOMEN WHO MIGHT PRESENT HIM WITH A NICE DOSE TO LAST HIM
HIS LIFETIME
IN THE NATURE OF SINGLE BLESSEDNESS HE WOULD ONE DAY TAKE
UNTO HIMSELF A WIFE WHEN MISS RIGHT CAME ON THE SCENE BUT IN THE INTERIM
LADIES' SOCIETY WAS A CONDITIO SINE QUA NON THOUGH HE HAD THE GRAVEST
POSSIBLE DOUBTS NOT THAT HE WANTED IN THE SMALLEST TO PUMP STEPHEN
ABOUT MISS FERGUSON WHO WAS VERY POSSIBLY THE PARTICULAR LODESTAR WHO
BROUGHT HIM DOWN TO IRISHTOWN SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AS TO WHETHER HE
WOULD FIND MUCH SATISFACTION BASKING IN THE BOY AND GIRL COURTSHIP IDEA
AND THE COMPANY OF SMIRKING MISSES WITHOUT A PENNY TO THEIR NAMES BI OR
TRIWEEKLY WITH THE ORTHODOX PRELIMINARY CANTER OF COMPLIMENTPLAYING AND
WALKING OUT LEADING UP TO FOND LOVERS' WAYS AND FLOWERS AND CHOCS
TO
THINK OF HIM HOUSE AND HOMELESS ROOKED BY SOME LANDLADY WORSE THAN ANY
STEPMOTHER WAS REALLY TOO BAD AT HIS AGE
THE QUEER SUDDENLY THINGS
HE POPPED OUT WITH ATTRACTED THE ELDER MAN WHO WAS SEVERAL YEARS THE
OTHER'S SENIOR OR LIKE HIS FATHER BUT SOMETHING SUBSTANTIAL HE CERTAINLY
OUGHT TO EAT EVEN WERE IT ONLY AN EGGFLIP MADE ON UNADULTERATED MATERNAL
NUTRIMENT OR FAILING THAT THE HOMELY HUMPTY DUMPTY BOILED
AT WHAT O'CLOCK DID YOU DINE HE QUESTIONED OF THE SLIM FORM AND TIRED
THOUGH UNWRINKLED FACE
SOME TIME YESTERDAY STEPHEN SAID
YESTERDAY EXCLAIMED BLOOM TILL HE REMEMBERED IT WAS ALREADY TOMORROW
FRIDAY
AH YOU MEAN IT'S AFTER TWELVE
THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY STEPHEN SAID IMPROVING ON HIMSELF
LITERALLY ASTOUNDED AT THIS PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE BLOOM REFLECTED
THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SEE EYE TO EYE IN EVERYTHING A CERTAIN ANALOGY THERE
SOMEHOW WAS AS IF BOTH THEIR MINDS WERE TRAVELLING SO TO SPEAK IN THE
ONE TRAIN OF THOUGHT
AT HIS AGE WHEN DABBLING IN POLITICS ROUGHLY
SOME SCORE OF YEARS PREVIOUSLY WHEN HE HAD BEEN A QUASI ASPIRANT TO
PARLIAMENTARY HONOURS IN THE BUCKSHOT FOSTER DAYS HE TOO RECOLLECTED IN
RETROSPECT WHICH WAS A SOURCE OF KEEN SATISFACTION IN ITSELF HE HAD
A SNEAKING REGARD FOR THOSE SAME ULTRA IDEAS
FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE
EVICTED TENANTS QUESTION THEN AT ITS FIRST INCEPTION BULKED LARGELY IN
PEOPLE'S MIND THOUGH IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING NOT CONTRIBUTING A COPPER
OR PINNING HIS FAITH ABSOLUTELY TO ITS DICTUMS SOME OF WHICH WOULDN'T
EXACTLY HOLD WATER HE AT THE OUTSET IN PRINCIPLE AT ALL EVENTS WAS IN
THOROUGH SYMPATHY WITH PEASANT POSSESSION AS VOICING THE TREND OF MODERN
OPINION A PARTIALITY HOWEVER WHICH REALISING HIS MISTAKE HE WAS
SUBSEQUENTLY PARTIALLY CURED OF AND EVEN WAS TWITTED WITH GOING A
STEP FARTHER THAN MICHAEL DAVITT IN THE STRIKING VIEWS HE AT ONE TIME
INCULCATED AS A BACKTOTHELANDER WHICH WAS ONE REASON HE STRONGLY
RESENTED THE INNUENDO PUT UPON HIM IN SO BAREFACED A FASHION BY OUR
FRIEND AT THE GATHERING OF THE CLANS IN BARNEY KIERNAN'S SO THAT HE
THOUGH OFTEN CONSIDERABLY MISUNDERSTOOD AND THE LEAST PUGNACIOUS OF
MORTALS BE IT REPEATED DEPARTED FROM HIS CUSTOMARY HABIT TO GIVE
HIM METAPHORICALLY ONE IN THE GIZZARD THOUGH SO FAR AS POLITICS
THEMSELVES WERE CONCERNED HE WAS ONLY TOO CONSCIOUS OF THE CASUALTIES
INVARIABLY RESULTING FROM PROPAGANDA AND DISPLAYS OF MUTUAL ANIMOSITY
AND THE MISERY AND SUFFERING IT ENTAILED AS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION ON
FINE YOUNG FELLOWS CHIEFLY DESTRUCTION OF THE FITTEST IN A WORD
ANYHOW UPON WEIGHING UP THE PROS AND CONS GETTING ON FOR ONE AS IT
WAS IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT
THE CRUX WAS IT
WAS A BIT RISKY TO BRING HIM HOME AS EVENTUALITIES MIGHT POSSIBLY ENSUE
SOMEBODY HAVING A TEMPER OF HER OWN SOMETIMES AND SPOIL THE HASH
ALTOGETHER AS ON THE NIGHT HE MISGUIDEDLY BROUGHT HOME A DOG BREED
UNKNOWN WITH A LAME PAW NOT THAT THE CASES WERE EITHER IDENTICAL OR
THE REVERSE THOUGH HE HAD HURT HIS HAND TOO TO ONTARIO TERRACE AS HE
VERY DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING BEEN THERE SO TO SPEAK
ON THE
OTHER HAND IT WAS ALTOGETHER FAR AND AWAY TOO LATE FOR THE SANDYMOUNT
OR SANDYCOVE SUGGESTION SO THAT HE WAS IN SOME PERPLEXITY AS TO WHICH OF
THE TWO ALTERNATIVES
EVERYTHING POINTED TO THE FACT THAT IT BEHOVED HIM
TO AVAIL HIMSELF TO THE FULL OF THE OPPORTUNITY ALL THINGS CONSIDERED
HIS INITIAL IMPRESSION WAS HE WAS A SHADE STANDOFFISH OR NOT OVER
EFFUSIVE BUT IT GREW ON HIM SOMEWAY
FOR ONE THING HE MIGHTN'T WHAT YOU
CALL JUMP AT THE IDEA IF APPROACHED AND WHAT MOSTLY WORRIED HIM WAS
HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO LEAD UP TO IT OR WORD IT EXACTLY SUPPOSING HE
DID ENTERTAIN THE PROPOSAL AS IT WOULD AFFORD HIM VERY GREAT PERSONAL
PLEASURE IF HE WOULD ALLOW HIM TO HELP TO PUT COIN IN HIS WAY OR SOME

AT ALL EVENTS HE WOUND UP BY CONCLUDING
ESCHEWING FOR THE NONCE HIDEBOUND PRECEDENT A CUP OF EPPS'S COCOA AND
A SHAKEDOWN FOR THE NIGHT PLUS THE USE OF A RUG OR TWO AND OVERCOAT
DOUBLED INTO A PILLOW AT LEAST HE WOULD BE IN SAFE HANDS AND AS WARM AS
A TOAST ON A TRIVET HE FAILED TO PERCEIVE ANY VERY VAST AMOUNT OF HARM
IN THAT ALWAYS WITH THE PROVISO NO RUMPUS OF ANY SORT WAS KICKED UP
A MOVE HAD TO BE MADE BECAUSE THAT MERRY OLD SOUL THE GRASSWIDOWER
IN QUESTION WHO APPEARED TO BE GLUED TO THE SPOT DIDN'T APPEAR IN ANY
PARTICULAR HURRY TO WEND HIS WAY HOME TO HIS DEARLY BELOVED QUEENSTOWN
AND IT WAS HIGHLY LIKELY SOME SPONGER'S BAWDYHOUSE OF RETIRED BEAUTIES
WHERE AGE WAS NO BAR OFF SHERIFF STREET LOWER WOULD BE THE BEST CLUE

HE IN REALITY WAS LET X EQUAL MY RIGHT NAME AND ADDRESS AS MR ALGEBRA
REMARKS PASSIM
AT THE SAME TIME HE INWARDLY CHUCKLED OVER HIS GENTLE
REPARTEE TO THE BLOOD AND OUNS CHAMPION ABOUT HIS GOD BEING A JEW
PEOPLE COULD PUT UP WITH BEING BITTEN BY A WOLF BUT WHAT PROPERLY RILED
THEM WAS A BITE FROM A SHEEP
THE MOST VULNERABLE POINT TOO OF TENDER
ACHILLES
YOUR GOD WAS A JEW
BECAUSE MOSTLY THEY APPEARED TO IMAGINE HE
CAME FROM CARRICK ON SHANNON OR SOMEWHEREABOUTS IN THE COUNTY SLIGO
I PROPOSE OUR HERO EVENTUALLY SUGGESTED AFTER MATURE REFLECTION WHILE
PRUDENTLY POCKETING HER PHOTO AS IT'S RATHER STUFFY HERE YOU JUST COME
HOME WITH ME AND TALK THINGS OVER
MY DIGGINGS ARE QUITE CLOSE IN THE
VICINITY
YOU CAN'T DRINK THAT STUFF
DO YOU LIKE COCOA WAIT
I'LL JUST
PAY THIS LOT
THE BEST PLAN CLEARLY BEING TO CLEAR OUT THE REMAINDER BEING PLAIN
SAILING HE BECKONED WHILE PRUDENTLY POCKETING THE PHOTO TO THE KEEPER
OF THE SHANTY WHO DIDN'T SEEM TO
YES THAT'S THE BEST HE ASSURED STEPHEN TO WHOM FOR THE MATTER OF
THAT BRAZEN HEAD OR HIM OR ANYWHERE ELSE WAS ALL MORE OR LESS
ALL KINDS OF UTOPIAN PLANS WERE FLASHING THROUGH HIS B'S BUSY BRAIN
EDUCATION THE GENUINE ARTICLE LITERATURE JOURNALISM PRIZE TITBITS
UP TO DATE BILLING CONCERT TOURS IN ENGLISH WATERING RESORTS PACKED
WITH HYDROS AND SEASIDE THEATRES TURNING MONEY AWAY DUETS IN ITALIAN
WITH THE ACCENT PERFECTLY TRUE TO NATURE AND A QUANTITY OF OTHER
THINGS NO NECESSITY OF COURSE TO TELL THE WORLD AND HIS WIFE FROM THE
HOUSETOPS ABOUT IT AND A SLICE OF LUCK
AN OPENING WAS ALL WAS WANTED
BECAUSE HE MORE THAN SUSPECTED HE HAD HIS FATHER'S VOICE TO BANK HIS
HOPES ON WHICH IT WAS QUITE ON THE CARDS HE HAD SO IT WOULD BE JUST AS
WELL BY THE WAY NO HARM TO TRAIL THE CONVERSATION IN THE DIRECTION OF
THAT PARTICULAR RED HERRING JUST TO
THE CABBY READ OUT OF THE PAPER HE HAD GOT HOLD OF THAT THE FORMER
VICEROY EARL CADOGAN HAD PRESIDED AT THE CABDRIVERS' ASSOCIATION
DINNER IN LONDON SOMEWHERE
SILENCE WITH A YAWN OR TWO ACCOMPANIED THIS
THRILLING ANNOUNCEMENT
THEN THE OLD SPECIMEN IN THE CORNER WHO APPEARED
TO HAVE SOME SPARK OF VITALITY LEFT READ OUT THAT SIR ANTHONY MACDONNELL
HAD LEFT EUSTON FOR THE CHIEF SECRETARY'S LODGE OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT
TO WHICH ABSORBING PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE ECHO ANSWERED WHY
GIVE US A SQUINT AT THAT LITERATURE GRANDFATHER THE ANCIENT MARINER
PUT IN MANIFESTING SOME NATURAL IMPATIENCE
AND WELCOME ANSWERED THE ELDERLY PARTY THUS ADDRESSED
THE SAILOR LUGGED OUT FROM A CASE HE HAD A PAIR OF GREENISH GOGGLES
WHICH HE VERY SLOWLY HOOKED OVER HIS NOSE AND BOTH EARS
ARE YOU BAD IN THE EYES THE SYMPATHETIC PERSONAGE LIKE THE TOWNCLERK
QUERIED
WHY ANSWERED THE SEAFARER WITH THE TARTAN BEARD WHO SEEMINGLY WAS
A BIT OF A LITERARY COVE IN HIS OWN SMALL WAY STARING OUT OF SEAGREEN
PORTHOLES AS YOU MIGHT WELL DESCRIBE THEM AS I USES GOGGLES READING
SAND IN THE RED SEA DONE THAT
ONE TIME I COULD READ A BOOK IN THE DARK
MANNER OF SPEAKING
THE ARABIAN NIGHTS ENTERTAINMENT WAS MY FAVOURITE
AND RED AS A ROSE IS SHE
HEREUPON HE PAWED THE JOURNAL OPEN AND PORED UPON LORD ONLY KNOWS WHAT
FOUND DROWNED OR THE EXPLOITS OF KING WILLOW IREMONGER HAVING MADE A
HUNDRED AND SOMETHING SECOND WICKET NOT OUT FOR NOTTS DURING WHICH
TIME COMPLETELY REGARDLESS OF IRE THE KEEPER WAS INTENSELY OCCUPIED
LOOSENING AN APPARENTLY NEW OR SECONDHAND BOOT WHICH MANIFESTLY PINCHED
HIM AS HE MUTTERED AGAINST WHOEVER IT WAS SOLD IT ALL OF THEM WHO WERE
SUFFICIENTLY AWAKE ENOUGH TO BE PICKED OUT BY THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
THAT IS TO SAY EITHER SIMPLY LOOKING ON GLUMLY OR PASSING A TRIVIAL
REMARK
TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT BLOOM GRASPING THE SITUATION WAS THE FIRST
TO RISE FROM HIS SEAT SO AS NOT TO OUTSTAY THEIR WELCOME HAVING FIRST
AND FOREMOST BEING AS GOOD AS HIS WORD THAT HE WOULD FOOT THE BILL FOR
THE OCCASION TAKEN THE WISE PRECAUTION TO UNOBTRUSIVELY MOTION TO MINE
HOST AS A PARTING SHOT A SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE SIGN WHEN THE OTHERS WERE
NOT LOOKING TO THE EFFECT THAT THE AMOUNT DUE WAS FORTHCOMING MAKING A
GRAND TOTAL OF FOURPENCE THE AMOUNT HE DEPOSITED UNOBTRUSIVELY IN
FOUR COPPERS LITERALLY THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS HE HAVING PREVIOUSLY
SPOTTED ON THE PRINTED PRICELIST FOR ALL WHO RAN TO READ OPPOSITE HIM
IN UNMISTAKABLE FIGURES COFFEE 2D CONFECTIONERY DO AND HONESTLY WELL
WORTH TWICE THE MONEY ONCE IN A WAY AS WETHERUP USED TO REMARK
COME HE COUNSELLED TO CLOSE THE SANCE
SEEING THAT THE RUSE WORKED AND THE COAST WAS CLEAR THEY LEFT THE
SHELTER OR SHANTY TOGETHER AND THE LITE SOCIETY OF OILSKIN AND
COMPANY WHOM NOTHING SHORT OF AN EARTHQUAKE WOULD MOVE OUT OF THEIR
DOLCE FAR NIENTE
STEPHEN WHO CONFESSED TO STILL FEELING POORLY AND
FAGGED OUT PAUSED AT THE FOR A MOMENT THE DOOR
ONE THING I NEVER UNDERSTOOD HE SAID TO BE ORIGINAL ON THE SPUR OF
THE MOMENT
WHY THEY PUT TABLES UPSIDE DOWN AT NIGHT I MEAN CHAIRS
UPSIDE DOWN ON THE TABLES IN CAFES
TO WHICH IMPROMPTU THE NEVERFAILING
BLOOM REPLIED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION SAYING STRAIGHT OFF
TO SWEEP THE FLOOR IN THE MORNING
SO SAYING HE SKIPPED AROUND NIMBLY CONSIDERING FRANKLY AT THE SAME
TIME APOLOGETIC TO GET ON HIS COMPANION'S RIGHT A HABIT OF HIS BY THE
BYE HIS RIGHT SIDE BEING IN CLASSICAL IDIOM HIS TENDER ACHILLES
THE
NIGHT AIR WAS CERTAINLY NOW A TREAT TO BREATHE THOUGH STEPHEN WAS A BIT
WEAK ON HIS PINS
IT WILL THE AIR DO YOU GOOD BLOOM SAID MEANING ALSO THE WALK IN
A MOMENT
THE ONLY THING IS TO WALK THEN YOU'LL FEEL A DIFFERENT MAN
COME
IT'S NOT FAR
LEAN ON ME
ACCORDINGLY HE PASSED HIS LEFT ARM IN STEPHEN'S RIGHT AND LED HIM ON
ACCORDINGLY
YES STEPHEN SAID UNCERTAINLY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE FELT A STRANGE
KIND OF FLESH OF A DIFFERENT MAN APPROACH HIM SINEWLESS AND WOBBLY AND
ALL THAT
ANYHOW THEY PASSED THE SENTRYBOX WITH STONES BRAZIER ETC
WHERE
THE MUNICIPAL SUPERNUMERARY EX GUMLEY WAS STILL TO ALL INTENTS AND
PURPOSES WRAPPED IN THE ARMS OF MURPHY AS THE ADAGE HAS IT DREAMING
OF FRESH FIELDS AND PASTURES NEW
AND APROPOS OF COFFIN OF STONES THE
ANALOGY WAS NOT AT ALL BAD AS IT WAS IN FACT A STONING TO DEATH ON THE
PART OF SEVENTYTWO OUT OF EIGHTY ODD CONSTITUENCIES THAT RATTED AT THE
TIME OF THE SPLIT AND CHIEFLY THE BELAUDED PEASANT CLASS PROBABLY THE
SELFSAME EVICTED TENANTS HE HAD PUT IN THEIR HOLDINGS
SO THEY TURNED ON TO CHATTING ABOUT MUSIC A FORM OF ART FOR WHICH
BLOOM AS A PURE AMATEUR POSSESSED THE GREATEST LOVE AS THEY MADE
TRACKS ARM IN ARM ACROSS BERESFORD PLACE
WAGNERIAN MUSIC THOUGH
CONFESSEDLY GRAND IN ITS WAY WAS A BIT TOO HEAVY FOR BLOOM AND HARD TO
FOLLOW AT THE FIRST GO OFF BUT THE MUSIC OF MERCADANTE'S HUGUENOTS
MEYERBEER'S SEVEN LAST WORDS ON THE CROSS AND MOZART'S TWELFTH MASS
HE SIMPLY REVELLED IN THE GLORIA IN THAT BEING TO HIS MIND THE ACME
OF FIRST CLASS MUSIC AS SUCH LITERALLY KNOCKING EVERYTHING ELSE INTO
A COCKED HAT
HE INFINITELY PREFERRED THE SACRED MUSIC OF THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH TO ANYTHING THE OPPOSITE SHOP COULD OFFER IN THAT LINE SUCH AS
THOSE MOODY AND SANKEY HYMNS OR BID ME TO LIVE AND I WILL LIVE
THY PROTESTANT TO BE
HE ALSO YIELDED TO NONE IN HIS ADMIRATION OF
ROSSINI'S STABAT MATER A WORK SIMPLY ABOUNDING IN IMMORTAL NUMBERS
IN WHICH HIS WIFE MADAM MARION TWEEDY MADE A HIT A VERITABLE
SENSATION HE MIGHT SAFELY SAY GREATLY ADDING TO HER OTHER LAUREIS AND
PUTTING THE OTHERS TOTALLY IN THE SHADE IN THE JESUIT FATHERS' CHURCH
IN UPPER GARDINER STREET THE SACRED EDIFICE BEING THRONGED TO THE
DOORS TO HEAR HER WITH VIRTUOSOS OR VIRTUOSI RATHER
THERE WAS THE
UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT THERE WAS NONE TO COME UP TO HER AND SUFFICE IT
TO SAY IN A PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR MUSIC OF A SACRED CHARACTER THERE WAS
A GENERALLY VOICED DESIRE FOR AN ENCORE
ON THE WHOLE THOUGH FAVOURING
PREFERABLY LIGHT OPERA OF THE DON GIOVANNI DESCRIPTION AND MARTHA
A GEM IN ITS LINE HE HAD A PENCHANT THOUGH WITH ONLY A SURFACE
KNOWLEDGE FOR THE SEVERE CLASSICAL SCHOOL SUCH AS MENDELSSOHN
AND
TALKING OF THAT TAKING IT FOR GRANTED HE KNEW ALL ABOUT THE OLD
FAVOURITES HE MENTIONED PAR EXCELLENCE LIONEL'S AIR IN MARTHA
M'APPARI WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HE HAD HEARD OR OVERHEARD TO BE
MORE ACCURATE ON YESTERDAY A PRIVILEGE HE KEENLY APPRECIATED FROM THE
LIPS OF STEPHEN'S RESPECTED FATHER SUNG TO PERFECTION A STUDY OF THE
NUMBER IN FACT WHICH MADE ALL THE OTHERS TAKE A BACK SEAT
STEPHEN IN
REPLY TO A POLITELY PUT QUERY SAID HE DIDN'T SING IT BUT LAUNCHED
OUT INTO PRAISES OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONGS AT LEAST OF IN OR ABOUT THAT
PERIOD THE LUTENIST DOWLAND WHO LIVED IN FETTER LANE NEAR GERARD THE
HERBALIST WHO ANNO LUDENDO HAUSI DOULANDUS AN INSTRUMENT HE WAS
CONTEMPLATING PURCHASING FROM MR ARNOLD DOLMETSCH WHOM B
DID NOT QUITE
RECALL THOUGH THE NAME CERTAINLY SOUNDED FAMILIAR FOR SIXTYFIVE GUINEAS
AND FARNABY AND SON WITH THEIR DUX AND COMES CONCEITS AND BYRD
WILLIAM WHO PLAYED THE VIRGINALS HE SAID IN THE QUEEN'S CHAPEL OR
ANYWHERE ELSE HE FOUND THEM AND ONE TOMKINS WHO MADE TOYS OR AIRS AND
JOHN BULL
ON THE ROADWAY WHICH THEY WERE APPROACHING WHILST STILL SPEAKING BEYOND
THE SWINGCHAINS A HORSE DRAGGING A SWEEPER PACED ON THE PAVEN GROUND
BRUSHING A LONG SWATHE OF MIRE UP SO THAT WITH THE NOISE BLOOM WAS NOT
PERFECTLY CERTAIN WHETHER HE HAD CAUGHT ARIGHT THE ALLUSION TO SIXTYFIVE
GUINEAS AND JOHN BULL
HE INQUIRED IF IT WAS JOHN BULL THE POLITICAL
CELEBRITY OF THAT ILK AS IT STRUCK HIM THE TWO IDENTICAL NAMES AS A
STRIKING COINCIDENCE
BY THE CHAINS THE HORSE SLOWLY SWERVED TO TURN WHICH PERCEIVING BLOOM
WHO WAS KEEPING A SHARP LOOKOUT AS USUAL PLUCKED THE OTHER'S SLEEVE
GENTLY JOCOSELY REMARKING
OUR LIVES ARE IN PERIL TONIGHT
BEWARE OF THE STEAMROLLER
THEY THEREUPON STOPPED
BLOOM LOOKED AT THE HEAD OF A HORSE NOT WORTH
ANYTHING LIKE SIXTYFIVE GUINEAS SUDDENLY IN EVIDENCE IN THE DARK QUITE
NEAR SO THAT IT SEEMED NEW A DIFFERENT GROUPING OF BONES AND EVEN FLESH
BECAUSE PALPABLY IT WAS A FOURWALKER A HIPSHAKER A BLACKBUTTOCKER A
TAILDANGLER A HEADHANGER PUTTING HIS HIND FOOT FOREMOST THE WHILE THE
LORD OF HIS CREATION SAT ON THE PERCH BUSY WITH HIS THOUGHTS
BUT SUCH
A GOOD POOR BRUTE HE WAS SORRY HE HADN'T A LUMP OF SUGAR BUT AS HE
WISELY REFLECTED YOU COULD SCARCELY BE PREPARED FOR EVERY EMERGENCY
THAT MIGHT CROP UP
HE WAS JUST A BIG NERVOUS FOOLISH NOODLY KIND OF A
HORSE WITHOUT A SECOND CARE IN THE WORLD
BUT EVEN A DOG HE REFLECTED
TAKE THAT MONGREL IN BARNEY KIERNAN'S OF THE SAME SIZE WOULD BE A HOLY
HORROR TO FACE
BUT IT WAS NO ANIMAL'S FAULT IN PARTICULAR IF HE WAS
BUILT THAT WAY LIKE THE CAMEL SHIP OF THE DESERT DISTILLING GRAPES
INTO POTHEEN IN HIS HUMP
NINE TENTHS OF THEM ALL COULD BE CAGED OR
TRAINED NOTHING BEYOND THE ART OF MAN BARRING THE BEES
WHALE WITH A
HARPOON HAIRPIN ALLIGATOR TICKLE THE SMALL OF HIS BACK AND HE SEES THE
JOKE CHALK A CIRCLE FOR A ROOSTER TIGER MY EAGLE EYE
THESE TIMELY
REFLECTIONS ANENT THE BRUTES OF THE FIELD OCCUPIED HIS MIND SOMEWHAT
DISTRACTED FROM STEPHEN'S WORDS WHILE THE SHIP OF THE STREET WAS
MANOEUVRING AND STEPHEN WENT ON ABOUT THE HIGHLY INTERESTING OLD
WHAT'S THIS I WAS SAYING AH YES MY WIFE HE INTIMATED PLUNGING
IN MEDIAS RES WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST OF PLEASURE IN MAKING YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE AS SHE IS PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO MUSIC OF ANY KIND
HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS IN A FRIENDLY FASHION AT THE SIDEFACE OF STEPHEN
IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER WHICH WAS NOT QUITE THE SAME AS THE USUAL HANDSOME
BLACKGUARD TYPE THEY UNQUESTIONABLY HAD AN INSATIABLE HANKERING AFTER AS
HE WAS PERHAPS NOT THAT WAY BUILT
STILL SUPPOSING HE HAD HIS FATHER'S GIFT AS HE MORE THAN SUSPECTED
IT OPENED UP NEW VISTAS IN HIS MIND SUCH AS LADY FINGALL'S IRISH
INDUSTRIES CONCERT ON THE PRECEDING MONDAY AND ARISTOCRACY IN GENERAL
EXQUISITE VARIATIONS HE WAS NOW DESCRIBING ON AN AIR YOUTH HERE HAS
END BY JANS PIETER SWEELINCK A DUTCHMAN OF AMSTERDAM WHERE THE FROWS
COME FROM
EVEN MORE HE LIKED AN OLD GERMAN SONG OF JOHANNES JEEP
ABOUT THE CLEAR SEA AND THE VOICES OF SIRENS SWEET MURDERERS OF MEN
WHICH BOGGLED BLOOM A BIT
VON DER SIRENEN LISTIGKEIT
TUN DIE POETEN DICHTEN
THESE OPENING BARS HE SANG AND TRANSLATED EXTEMPORE
BLOOM NODDING
SAID HE PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD AND BEGGED HIM TO GO ON BY ALL MEANS WHICH
HE DID
A PHENOMENALLY BEAUTIFUL TENOR VOICE LIKE THAT THE RAREST OF BOONS
WHICH BLOOM APPRECIATED AT THE VERY FIRST NOTE HE GOT OUT COULD EASILY
IF PROPERLY HANDLED BY SOME RECOGNISED AUTHORITY ON VOICE PRODUCTION
SUCH AS BARRACLOUGH AND BEING ABLE TO READ MUSIC INTO THE BARGAIN
COMMAND ITS OWN PRICE WHERE BARITONES WERE TEN A PENNY AND PROCURE FOR
ITS FORTUNATE POSSESSOR IN THE NEAR FUTURE AN ENTRE INTO FASHIONABLE
HOUSES IN THE BEST RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS OF FINANCIAL MAGNATES IN A LARGE
WAY OF BUSINESS AND TITLED PEOPLE WHERE WITH HIS UNIVERSITY DEGREE OF
B
A
A HUGE AD IN ITS WAY AND GENTLEMANLY BEARING TO ALL THE MORE
INFLUENCE THE GOOD IMPRESSION HE WOULD INFALLIBLY SCORE A DISTINCT
SUCCESS BEING BLESSED WITH BRAINS WHICH ALSO COULD BE UTILISED FOR THE
PURPOSE AND OTHER REQUISITES IF HIS CLOTHES WERE PROPERLY ATTENDED
TO SO AS TO THE BETTER WORM HIS WAY INTO THEIR GOOD GRACES AS HE A
YOUTHFUL TYRO IN SOCIETY'S SARTORIAL NICETIES HARDLY UNDERSTOOD HOW A
LITTLE THING LIKE THAT COULD MILITATE AGAINST YOU
IT WAS IN FACT ONLY A
MATTER OF MONTHS AND HE COULD EASILY FORESEE HIM PARTICIPATING IN THEIR
MUSICAL AND ARTISTIC CONVERSAZIONES DURING THE FESTIVITIES OF THE
CHRISTMAS SEASON FOR CHOICE CAUSING A SLIGHT FLUTTER IN THE DOVECOTES
OF THE FAIR SEX AND BEING MADE A LOT OF BY LADIES OUT FOR SENSATION
CASES OF WHICH AS HE HAPPENED TO KNOW WERE ON RECORD IN FACT WITHOUT
GIVING THE SHOW AWAY HE HIMSELF ONCE UPON A TIME IF HE CARED TO COULD
EASILY HAVE
ADDED TO WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE THE PECUNIARY EMOLUMENT
BY NO MEANS TO BE SNEEZED AT GOING HAND IN HAND WITH HIS TUITION
FEES
NOT HE PARENTHESISED THAT FOR THE SAKE OF FILTHY LUCRE HE NEED
NECESSARILY EMBRACE THE LYRIC PLATFORM AS A WALK IN LIFE FOR ANY LENGTHY
SPACE OF TIME
BUT A STEP IN THE REQUIRED DIRECTION IT WAS BEYOND YEA OR
NAY AND BOTH MONETARILY AND MENTALLY IT CONTAINED NO REFLECTION ON HIS
DIGNITY IN THE SMALLEST AND IT OFTEN TURNED IN UNCOMMONLY HANDY TO
BE HANDED A CHEQUE AT A MUCHNEEDED MOMENT WHEN EVERY LITTLE HELPED
BESIDES THOUGH TASTE LATTERLY HAD DETERIORATED TO A DEGREE ORIGINAL
MUSIC LIKE THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE CONVENTIONAL RUT WOULD RAPIDLY
HAVE A GREAT VOGUE AS IT WOULD BE A DECIDED NOVELTY FOR DUBLIN'S MUSICAL
WORLD AFTER THE USUAL HACKNEYED RUN OF CATCHY TENOR SOLOS FOISTED ON A
CONFIDING PUBLIC BY IVAN ST AUSTELL AND HILTON ST JUST AND THEIR GENUS
OMNE
YES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT HE COULD WITH ALL THE CARDS IN
HIS HAND AND HE HAD A CAPITAL OPENING TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF AND WIN
A HIGH PLACE IN THE CITY'S ESTEEM WHERE HE COULD COMMAND A STIFF FIGURE
AND BOOKING AHEAD GIVE A GRAND CONCERT FOR THE PATRONS OF THE KING
STREET HOUSE GIVEN A BACKERUP IF ONE WERE FORTHCOMING TO KICK HIM
UPSTAIRS SO TO SPEAK A BIG IF HOWEVER WITH SOME IMPETUS OF THE
GOAHEAD SORT TO OBVIATE THE INEVITABLE PROCRASTINATION WHICH OFTEN
TRIPPED UP A TOO MUCH FTED PRINCE OF GOOD FELLOWS
AND IT NEED NOT
DETRACT FROM THE OTHER BY ONE IOTA AS BEING HIS OWN MASTER HE WOULD
HAVE HEAPS OF TIME TO PRACTISE LITERATURE IN HIS SPARE MOMENTS WHEN
DESIROUS OF SO DOING WITHOUT ITS CLASHING WITH HIS VOCAL CAREER OR
CONTAINING ANYTHING DEROGATORY WHATSOEVER AS IT WAS A MATTER FOR HIMSELF
ALONE
IN FACT HE HAD THE BALL AT HIS FEET AND THAT WAS THE VERY REASON
WHY THE OTHER POSSESSED OF A REMARKABLY SHARP NOSE FOR SMELLING A RAT
OF ANY SORT HUNG ON TO HIM AT ALL
THE HORSE WAS JUST THEN
AND LATER ON AT A PROPITIOUS OPPORTUNITY HE
PURPOSED BLOOM DID WITHOUT ANYWAY PRYING INTO HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS ON
THE FOOLS STEP IN WHERE ANGELS PRINCIPLE ADVISING HIM TO SEVER HIS
CONNECTION WITH A CERTAIN BUDDING PRACTITIONER WHO HE NOTICED WAS
PRONE TO DISPARAGE AND EVEN TO A SLIGHT EXTENT WITH SOME HILARIOUS
PRETEXT WHEN NOT PRESENT DEPRECATE HIM OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO CALL IT
WHICH IN BLOOM'S HUMBLE OPINION THREW A NASTY SIDELIGHT ON THAT SIDE OF
A PERSON'S CHARACTER NO PUN INTENDED
THE HORSE HAVING REACHED THE END OF HIS TETHER SO TO SPEAK HALTED AND
REARING HIGH A PROUD FEATHERING TAIL ADDED HIS QUOTA BY LETTING FALL ON
THE FLOOR WHICH THE BRUSH WOULD SOON BRUSH UP AND POLISH THREE SMOKING
GLOBES OF TURDS
SLOWLY THREE TIMES ONE AFTER ANOTHER FROM A FULL
CRUPPER HE MIRED
AND HUMANELY HIS DRIVER WAITED TILL HE OR SHE HAD
ENDED PATIENT IN HIS SCYTHED CAR
SIDE BY SIDE BLOOM PROFITING BY THE CONTRETEMPS WITH STEPHEN PASSED
THROUGH THE GAP OF THE CHAINS DIVIDED BY THE UPRIGHT AND STEPPING
OVER A STRAND OF MIRE WENT ACROSS TOWARDS GARDINER STREET LOWER
STEPHEN SINGING MORE BOLDLY BUT NOT LOUDLY THE END OF THE BALLAD
UND ALLE SCHIFFE BRCKEN
THE DRIVER NEVER SAID A WORD GOOD BAD OR INDIFFERENT BUT MERELY
WATCHED THE TWO FIGURES AS HE SAT ON HIS LOWBACKED CAR BOTH BLACK
ONE FULL ONE LEAN WALK TOWARDS THE RAILWAY BRIDGE TO BE MARRIED BY
FATHER MAHER
AS THEY WALKED THEY AT TIMES STOPPED AND WALKED AGAIN
CONTINUING THEIR TTE TTE WHICH OF COURSE HE WAS UTTERLY OUT
OF ABOUT SIRENS ENEMIES OF MAN'S REASON MINGLED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER
TOPICS OF THE SAME CATEGORY USURPERS HISTORICAL CASES OF THE KIND
WHILE THE MAN IN THE SWEEPER CAR OR YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL IT IN THE
SLEEPER CAR WHO IN ANY CASE COULDN'T POSSIBLY HEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO
FAR SIMPLY SAT IN HIS SEAT NEAR THE END OF LOWER GARDINER STREET AND
LOOKED AFTER THEIR LOWBACKED CAR
WHAT PARALLEL COURSES DID BLOOM AND STEPHEN FOLLOW RETURNING
STARTING UNITED BOTH AT NORMAL WALKING PACE FROM BERESFORD PLACE THEY
FOLLOWED IN THE ORDER NAMED LOWER AND MIDDLE GARDINER STREETS AND
MOUNTJOY SQUARE WEST THEN AT REDUCED PACE EACH BEARING LEFT
GARDINER'S PLACE BY AN INADVERTENCE AS FAR AS THE FARTHER CORNER OF
TEMPLE STREET THEN AT REDUCED PACE WITH INTERRUPTIONS OF HALT BEARING

ATTRIBUTED TO THE REAPPARITION OF A MATUTINAL CLOUD PERCEIVED BY BOTH

OF HIS BLOOM'S HOUSE IN LOMBARD STREET WEST
WHAT REFLECTION CONCERNING THE IRREGULAR SEQUENCE OF DATES 1884 1885
1886 1888 1892 1893 1904 DID BLOOM MAKE BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL AT
THEIR DESTINATION
HE REFLECTED THAT THE PROGRESSIVE EXTENSION OF THE FIELD OF INDIVIDUAL
DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIENCE WAS REGRESSIVELY ACCOMPANIED BY A RESTRICTION
OF THE CONVERSE DOMAIN OF INTERINDIVIDUAL RELATIONS
AS IN WHAT WAYS
FROM INEXISTENCE TO EXISTENCE HE CAME TO MANY AND WAS AS ONE RECEIVED
EXISTENCE WITH EXISTENCE HE WAS WITH ANY AS ANY WITH ANY FROM EXISTENCE
TO NONEXISTENCE GONE HE WOULD BE BY ALL AS NONE PERCEIVED

OF HIS TROUSERS TO OBTAIN HIS LATCHKEY

IT WAS IN THE CORRESPONDING POCKET OF THE TROUSERS WHICH HE HAD WORN ON
THE DAY BUT ONE PRECEDING
WHY WAS HE DOUBLY IRRITATED
BECAUSE HE HAD FORGOTTEN AND BECAUSE HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD REMINDED
HIMSELF TWICE NOT TO FORGET
WHAT WERE THEN THE ALTERNATIVES BEFORE THE PREMEDITATEDLY
RESPECTIVELY AND INADVERTENTLY KEYLESS COUPLE
TO ENTER OR NOT TO ENTER
TO KNOCK OR NOT TO KNOCK
BLOOM'S DECISION
A STRATAGEM
RESTING HIS FEET ON THE DWARF WALL HE CLIMBED OVER THE
AREA RAILINGS COMPRESSED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD GRASPED TWO POINTS AT
THE LOWER UNION OF RAILS AND STILES LOWERED HIS BODY GRADUALLY BY ITS

THE HALLDOOR TURNED GRADUALLY ON ITS HINGES

CANDLE PAST A LIGHTED CREVICE OF DOORWAY ON THE LEFT AND CAREFULLY DOWN

HE EXTINGUISHED THE CANDLE BY A SHARP EXPIRATION OF BREATH UPON ITS
FLAME DREW TWO SPOONSEAT DEAL CHAIRS TO THE HEARTHSTONE ONE FOR

THAT HE WAS HYDROPHOBE HATING PARTIAL CONTACT BY IMMERSION OR TOTAL BY
SUBMERSION IN COLD WATER HIS LAST BATH HAVING TAKEN PLACE IN THE MONTH

WHAT ANNOUNCED THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THIS RISE IN TEMPERATURE
A DOUBLE FALCIFORM EJECTION OF WATER VAPOUR FROM UNDER THE KETTLELID AT
BOTH SIDES SIMULTANEOUSLY

INSPIRATION SHINING IN HIS COUNTENANCE AND BEARING IN HIS ARMS THE
SECRET OF THE RACE GRAVEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF PREDICTION
WHAT QUALIFYING CONSIDERATIONS ALLAYED HIS PERTURBATIONS
THE DIFFICULTIES OF INTERPRETATION SINCE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANY EVENT
FOLLOWED ITS OCCURRENCE AS VARIABLY AS THE ACOUSTIC REPORT FOLLOWED THE
ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE AND OF COUNTERESTIMATING AGAINST AN ACTUAL LOSS

ORIGINALLY FROM A SUCCESSFUL INTERPRETATION

WHAT SATISFIED HIM
TO HAVE SUSTAINED NO POSITIVE LOSS
TO HAVE BROUGHT A POSITIVE GAIN TO

LIGHT TO THE GENTILES
HOW DID BLOOM PREPARE A COLLATION FOR A GENTILE
HE POURED INTO TWO TEACUPS TWO LEVEL SPOONFULS FOUR IN ALL OF EPPS'S

ON THE LABEL TO EACH ADDING AFTER SUFFICIENT TIME FOR INFUSION THE

WHAT CEREBRATION ACCOMPANIED HIS FREQUENTATIVE ACT
CONCLUDING BY INSPECTION BUT ERRONEOUSLY THAT HIS SILENT COMPANION WAS
ENGAGED IN MENTAL COMPOSITION HE REFLECTED ON THE PLEASURES DERIVED FROM
LITERATURE OF INSTRUCTION RATHER THAN OF AMUSEMENT AS HE HIMSELF HAD
APPLIED TO THE WORKS OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE
SOLUTION OF DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN IMAGINARY OR REAL LIFE
HAD HE FOUND THEIR SOLUTION

WHAT RELATION EXISTED BETWEEN THEIR AGES
16 YEARS BEFORE IN 1888 WHEN BLOOM WAS OF STEPHEN'S PRESENT AGE STEPHEN
WAS 6
16 YEARS AFTER IN 1920 WHEN STEPHEN WOULD BE OF BLOOM'S PRESENT
AGE BLOOM WOULD BE 54
IN 1936 WHEN BLOOM WOULD BE 70 AND STEPHEN 54
THEIR AGES INITIALLY IN THE RATIO OF 16 TO 0 WOULD BE AS 17 1 2 TO 13
1 2 THE PROPORTION INCREASING AND THE DISPARITY DIMINISHING ACCORDING
AS ARBITRARY FUTURE YEARS WERE ADDED FOR IF THE PROPORTION EXISTING IN
1883 HAD CONTINUED IMMUTABLE CONCEIVING THAT TO BE POSSIBLE TILL THEN
1904 WHEN STEPHEN WAS 22 BLOOM WOULD BE 374 AND IN 1920 WHEN STEPHEN
WOULD BE 38 AS BLOOM THEN WAS BLOOM WOULD BE 646 WHILE IN 1952 WHEN
STEPHEN WOULD HAVE ATTAINED THE MAXIMUM POSTDILUVIAN AGE OF 70 BLOOM
BEING 1190 YEARS ALIVE HAVING BEEN BORN IN THE YEAR 714 WOULD HAVE
SURPASSED BY 221 YEARS THE MAXIMUM ANTEDILUVIAN AGE THAT OF METHUSALAH
969 YEARS WHILE IF STEPHEN WOULD CONTINUE TO LIVE UNTIL HE WOULD
ATTAIN THAT AGE IN THE YEAR 3072 A D BLOOM WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO
HAVE BEEN ALIVE 83 300 YEARS HAVING BEEN OBLIGED TO HAVE BEEN BORN IN
THE YEAR 81 396 B C
WHAT EVENTS MIGHT NULLIFY THESE CALCULATIONS
THE CESSATION OF EXISTENCE OF BOTH OR EITHER THE INAUGURATION OF A
NEW ERA OR CALENDAR THE ANNIHILATION OF THE WORLD AND CONSEQUENT
EXTERMINATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES INEVITABLE BUT IMPREDICTABLE
HOW MANY PREVIOUS ENCOUNTERS PROVED THEIR PREEXISTING ACQUAINTANCE
TWO
THE FIRST IN THE LILACGARDEN OF MATTHEW DILLON'S HOUSE MEDINA
VILLA KIMMAGE ROAD ROUNDTOWN IN 1887 IN THE COMPANY OF STEPHEN'S
MOTHER STEPHEN BEING THEN OF THE AGE OF 5 AND RELUCTANT TO GIVE HIS
HAND IN SALUTATION
THE SECOND IN THE COFFEEROOM OF BRESLIN'S HOTEL ON A
RAINY SUNDAY IN THE JANUARY OF 1892 IN THE COMPANY OF STEPHEN'S FATHER
AND STEPHEN'S GRANDUNCLE STEPHEN BEING THEN 5 YEARS OLDER
DID BLOOM ACCEPT THE INVITATION TO DINNER GIVEN THEN BY THE SON AND
AFTERWARDS SECONDED BY THE FATHER
VERY GRATEFULLY WITH GRATEFUL APPRECIATION WITH SINCERE APPRECIATIVE
GRATITUDE IN APPRECIATIVELY GRATEFUL SINCERITY OF REGRET HE DECLINED
DID THEIR CONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT OF THESE REMINISCENCES REVEAL A
THIRD CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THEM
MRS RIORDAN DANTE A WIDOW OF INDEPENDENT MEANS HAD RESIDED IN THE
HOUSE OF STEPHEN'S PARENTS FROM 1 SEPTEMBER 1888 TO 29 DECEMBER 1891 AND
HAD ALSO RESIDED DURING THE YEARS 1892 1893 AND 1894 IN THE CITY ARMS
HOTEL OWNED BY ELIZABETH O'DOWD OF 54 PRUSSIA STREET WHERE DURING PARTS
OF THE YEARS 1893 AND 1894 SHE HAD BEEN A CONSTANT INFORMANT OF BLOOM
WHO RESIDED ALSO IN THE SAME HOTEL BEING AT THAT TIME A CLERK IN THE
EMPLOYMENT OF JOSEPH CUFFE OF 5 SMITHFIELD FOR THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF
SALES IN THE ADJACENT DUBLIN CATTLE MARKET ON THE NORTH CIRCULAR ROAD
HAD HE PERFORMED ANY SPECIAL CORPORAL WORK OF MERCY FOR HER
HE HAD SOMETIMES PROPELLED HER ON WARM SUMMER EVENINGS AN INFIRM WIDOW
OF INDEPENDENT IF LIMITED MEANS IN HER CONVALESCENT BATHCHAIR
WITH SLOW REVOLUTIONS OF ITS WHEELS AS FAR AS THE CORNER OF THE NORTH
CIRCULAR ROAD OPPOSITE MR GAVIN LOW'S PLACE OF BUSINESS WHERE SHE HAD
REMAINED FOR A CERTAIN TIME SCANNING THROUGH HIS ONELENSED BINOCULAR
FIELDGLASSES UNRECOGNISABLE CITIZENS ON TRAMCARS ROADSTER BICYCLES
EQUIPPED WITH INFLATED PNEUMATIC TYRES HACKNEY CARRIAGES TANDEMS
PRIVATE AND HIRED LANDAUS DOGCARTS PONYTRAPS AND BRAKES PASSING FROM
THE CITY TO THE PHOENIX PARK AND VICE VERSA
WHY COULD HE THEN SUPPORT THAT HIS VIGIL WITH THE GREATER EQUANIMITY
BECAUSE IN MIDDLE YOUTH HE HAD OFTEN SAT OBSERVING THROUGH A RONDEL
OF BOSSED GLASS OF A MULTICOLOURED PANE THE SPECTACLE OFFERED WITH
CONTINUAL CHANGES OF THE THOROUGHFARE WITHOUT PEDESTRIANS QUADRUPEDS
VELOCIPEDES VEHICLES PASSING SLOWLY QUICKLY EVENLY ROUND AND ROUND

CATARRHAL DEAFNESS THE YOUNGER HER LAMP OF COLZA OIL BEFORE THE STATUE
OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION HER GREEN AND MAROON BRUSHES FOR CHARLES
STEWART PARNELL AND FOR MICHAEL DAVITT HER TISSUE PAPERS
WERE THERE NO MEANS STILL REMAINING TO HIM TO ACHIEVE THE REJUVENATION

MORE DESIRABLE
THE INDOOR EXERCISES FORMERLY INTERMITTENTLY PRACTISED SUBSEQUENTLY
ABANDONED PRESCRIBED IN EUGEN SANDOW'S PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND HOW TO
OBTAIN IT WHICH DESIGNED PARTICULARLY FOR COMMERCIAL MEN ENGAGED IN
SEDENTARY OCCUPATIONS WERE TO BE MADE WITH MENTAL CONCENTRATION IN
FRONT OF A MIRROR SO AS TO BRING INTO PLAY THE VARIOUS FAMILIES OF
MUSCLES AND PRODUCE SUCCESSIVELY A PLEASANT RIGIDITY A MORE PLEASANT
RELAXATION AND THE MOST PLEASANT REPRISTINATION OF JUVENILE AGILITY
HAD ANY SPECIAL AGILITY BEEN HIS IN EARLIER YOUTH
THOUGH RINGWEIGHT LIFTING HAD BEEN BEYOND HIS STRENGTH AND THE FULL
CIRCLE GYRATION BEYOND HIS COURAGE YET AS A HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLAR HE
HAD EXCELLED IN HIS STABLE AND PROTRACTED EXECUTION OF THE HALF LEVER
MOVEMENT ON THE PARALLEL BARS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS ABNORMALLY DEVELOPED
ABDOMINAL MUSCLES
DID EITHER OPENLY ALLUDE TO THEIR RACIAL DIFFERENCE
NEITHER
WHAT REDUCED TO THEIR SIMPLEST RECIPROCAL FORM WERE BLOOM'S THOUGHTS
ABOUT STEPHEN'S THOUGHTS ABOUT BLOOM AND ABOUT STEPHEN'S THOUGHTS ABOUT
BLOOM'S THOUGHTS ABOUT STEPHEN
HE THOUGHT THAT HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS A JEW WHEREAS HE KNEW THAT HE
KNEW THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT

SUBSTITUTING BLOOM FOR

JUNIOR MIDDLE AND SENIOR GRADES OF THE INTERMEDIATE AND THROUGH THE
MATRICULATION FIRST ARTS SECOND ARTS AND ARTS DEGREE COURSES OF THE
ROYAL UNIVERSITY
WHY DID BLOOM REFRAIN FROM STATING THAT HE HAD FREQUENTED THE UNIVERSITY
OF LIFE
BECAUSE OF HIS FLUCTUATING INCERTITUDE AS TO WHETHER THIS OBSERVATION
HAD OR HAD NOT BEEN ALREADY MADE BY HIM TO STEPHEN OR BY STEPHEN TO HIM
WHAT TWO TEMPERAMENTS DID THEY INDIVIDUALLY REPRESENT
THE SCIENTIFIC
THE ARTISTIC
WHAT PROOFS DID BLOOM ADDUCE TO PROVE THAT HIS TENDENCY WAS TOWARDS
APPLIED RATHER THAN TOWARDS PURE SCIENCE
CERTAIN POSSIBLE INVENTIONS OF WHICH HE HAD COGITATED WHEN RECLINING
IN A STATE OF SUPINE REPLETION TO AID DIGESTION STIMULATED BY HIS
APPRECIATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF INVENTIONS NOW COMMON BUT ONCE
REVOLUTIONARY FOR EXAMPLE THE AERONAUTIC PARACHUTE THE REFLECTING

LITTLE HARRY HUGHES AND HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS ALL
WENT OUT FOR TO PLAY BALL
AND THE VERY FIRST BALL LITTLE HARRY HUGHES PLAYED
HE DROVE IT O'ER THE JEW'S GARDEN WALL

CONDENSE STEPHEN'S COMMENTARY
ONE OF ALL THE LEAST OF ALL IS THE VICTIM PREDESTINED
ONCE BY
INADVERTENCE TWICE BY DESIGN HE CHALLENGES HIS DESTINY
IT COMES WHEN HE
IS ABANDONED AND CHALLENGES HIM RELUCTANT AND AS AN APPARITION OF HOPE
AND YOUTH HOLDS HIM UNRESISTING
IT LEADS HIM TO A STRANGE HABITATION
TO A SECRET INFIDEL APARTMENT AND THERE IMPLACABLE IMMOLATES HIM

WHY WAS THE HOST VICTIM PREDESTINED SAD
HE WISHED THAT A TALE OF A DEED SHOULD BE TOLD OF A DEED NOT BY HIM
SHOULD BY HIM NOT BE TOLD
WHY WAS THE HOST RELUCTANT UNRESISTING STILL

SIMILARLY BECAUSE ACTUATED BY A SECRET PURPOSE THE QUEST OF A NEW MALE

OF SUCH AN EXTEMPORISATION
FOR THE GUEST SECURITY OF DOMICILE AND SECLUSION OF STUDY
FOR THE
HOST REJUVENATION OF INTELLIGENCE VICARIOUS SATISFACTION
FOR THE
HOSTESS DISINTEGRATION OF OBSESSION ACQUISITION OF CORRECT ITALIAN
PRONUNCIATION
WHY MIGHT THESE SEVERAL PROVISIONAL CONTINGENCIES BETWEEN A GUEST AND
A HOSTESS NOT NECESSARILY PRECLUDE OR BE PRECLUDED BY A PERMANENT
EVENTUALITY OF RECONCILIATORY UNION BETWEEN A SCHOOLFELLOW AND A JEW'S
DAUGHTER
BECAUSE THE WAY TO DAUGHTER LED THROUGH MOTHER THE WAY TO MOTHER
THROUGH DAUGHTER
TO WHAT INCONSEQUENT POLYSYLLABIC QUESTION OF HIS HOST DID THE GUEST

WHAT RENDERED PROBLEMATIC FOR BLOOM THE REALISATION OF THESE MUTUALLY
SELFEXCLUDING PROPOSITIONS
THE IRREPARABILITY OF THE PAST ONCE AT A PERFORMANCE OF ALBERT
HENGLER'S CIRCUS IN THE ROTUNDA RUTLAND SQUARE DUBLIN AN INTUITIVE
PARTICOLOURED CLOWN IN QUEST OF PATERNITY HAD PENETRATED FROM THE RING
TO A PLACE IN THE AUDITORIUM WHERE BLOOM SOLITARY WAS SEATED AND HAD
PUBLICLY DECLARED TO AN EXHILARATED AUDIENCE THAT HE BLOOM WAS HIS
THE CLOWN'S PAPA
THE IMPREVIDIBILITY OF THE FUTURE ONCE IN THE
SUMMER OF 1898 HE BLOOM HAD MARKED A FLORIN 2 WITH THREE NOTCHES
ON THE MILLED EDGE AND TENDERED IT M PAYMENT OF AN ACCOUNT DUE TO AND
RECEIVED BY J
AND T
DAVY FAMILY GROCERS 1 CHARLEMONT MALL GRAND
CANAL FOR CIRCULATION ON THE WATERS OF CIVIC FINANCE FOR POSSIBLE
CIRCUITOUS OR DIRECT RETURN
WAS THE CLOWN BLOOM'S SON
NO
HAD BLOOM'S COIN RETURNED
NEVER
WHY WOULD A RECURRENT FRUSTRATION THE MORE DEPRESS HIM
BECAUSE AT THE CRITICAL TURNINGPOINT OF HUMAN EXISTENCE HE DESIRED TO
AMEND MANY SOCIAL CONDITIONS THE PRODUCT OF INEQUALITY AND AVARICE AND
INTERNATIONAL ANIMOSITY
HE BELIEVED THEN THAT HUMAN LIFE WAS INFINITELY
PERFECTIBLE ELIMINATING THESE CONDITIONS
THERE REMAINED THE GENERIC CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY NATURAL AS DISTINCT
FROM HUMAN LAW AS INTEGRAL PARTS OF THE HUMAN WHOLE THE NECESSITY OF
DESTRUCTION TO PROCURE ALIMENTARY SUSTENANCE THE PAINFUL CHARACTER OF
THE ULTIMATE FUNCTIONS OF SEPARATE EXISTENCE THE AGONIES OF BIRTH AND
DEATH THE MONOTONOUS MENSTRUATION OF SIMIAN AND PARTICULARLY HUMAN
FEMALES EXTENDING FROM THE AGE OF PUBERTY TO THE MENOPAUSE INEVITABLE
ACCIDENTS AT SEA IN MINES AND FACTORIES CERTAIN VERY PAINFUL MALADIES
AND THEIR RESULTANT SURGICAL OPERATIONS INNATE LUNACY AND CONGENITAL
CRIMINALITY DECIMATING EPIDEMICS CATASTROPHIC CATACLYSMS WHICH MAKE
TERROR THE BASIS OF HUMAN MENTALITY SEISMIC UPHEAVALS THE EPICENTRES
OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS THE FACT OF VITAL
GROWTH THROUGH CONVULSIONS OF METAMORPHOSIS FROM INFANCY THROUGH
MATURITY TO DECAY
WHY DID HE DESIST FROM SPECULATION
BECAUSE IT WAS A TASK FOR A SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE TO SUBSTITUTE OTHER
MORE ACCEPTABLE PHENOMENA IN THE PLACE OF THE LESS ACCEPTABLE PHENOMENA
TO BE REMOVED
DID STEPHEN PARTICIPATE IN HIS DEJECTION
HE AFFIRMED HIS SIGNIFICANCE AS A CONSCIOUS RATIONAL ANIMAL PROCEEDING
SYLLOGISTICALLY FROM THE KNOWN TO THE UNKNOWN AND A CONSCIOUS RATIONAL
REAGENT BETWEEN A MICRO AND A MACROCOSM INELUCTABLY CONSTRUCTED UPON THE
INCERTITUDE OF THE VOID
WAS THIS AFFIRMATION APPREHENDED BY BLOOM
NOT VERBALLY
SUBSTANTIALLY
WHAT COMFORTED HIS MISAPPREHENSION
THAT AS A COMPETENT KEYLESS CITIZEN HE HAD PROCEEDED ENERGETICALLY FROM
THE UNKNOWN TO THE KNOWN THROUGH THE INCERTITUDE OF THE VOID
IN WHAT ORDER OF PRECEDENCE WITH WHAT ATTENDANT CEREMONY WAS THE EXODUS
FROM THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE TO THE WILDERNESS OF INHABITATION EFFECTED

STEPHEN PUT THE HAT ON HIS HEAD
FOR WHAT CREATURE WAS THE DOOR OF EGRESS A DOOR OF INGRESS

WHAT SPECTACLE CONFRONTED THEM WHEN THEY FIRST THE HOST THEN THE
GUEST EMERGED SILENTLY DOUBLY DARK FROM OBSCURITY BY A PASSAGE FROM
THE RERE OF THE HOUSE INTO THE PENUMBRA OF THE GARDEN
THE HEAVENTREE OF STARS HUNG WITH HUMID NIGHTBLUE FRUIT
WITH WHAT MEDITATIONS DID BLOOM ACCOMPANY HIS DEMONSTRATION TO HIS
COMPANION OF VARIOUS CONSTELLATIONS
MEDITATIONS OF EVOLUTION INCREASINGLY VASTER OF THE MOON INVISIBLE IN
INCIPIENT LUNATION APPROACHING PERIGEE OF THE INFINITE LATTIGINOUS

TOWARDS THE CONSTELLATION OF HERCULES OF THE PARALLAX OR PARALLACTIC
DRIFT OF SOCALLED FIXED STARS IN REALITY EVERMOVING WANDERERS FROM
IMMEASURABLY REMOTE EONS TO INFINITELY REMOTE FUTURES IN COMPARISON WITH
WHICH THE YEARS THREESCORE AND TEN OF ALLOTTED HUMAN LIFE FORMED A
PARENTHESIS OF INFINITESIMAL BREVITY
WERE THERE OBVERSE MEDITATIONS OF INVOLUTION INCREASINGLY LESS VAST

EARTH OF THE MYRIAD MINUTE ENTOMOLOGICAL ORGANIC EXISTENCES CONCEALED

AGAIN DIVISIBLE IN DIVISIONS OF REDIVISIBLE COMPONENT BODIES DIVIDENDS
AND DIVISORS EVER DIMINISHING WITHOUT ACTUAL DIVISION TILL IF THE
PROGRESS WERE CARRIED FAR ENOUGH NOUGHT NOWHERE WAS NEVER REACHED
WHY DID HE NOT ELABORATE THESE CALCULATIONS TO A MORE PRECISE RESULT
BECAUSE SOME YEARS PREVIOUSLY IN 1886 WHEN OCCUPIED WITH THE PROBLEM
OF THE QUADRATURE OF THE CIRCLE HE HAD LEARNED OF THE EXISTENCE OF A
NUMBER COMPUTED TO A RELATIVE DEGREE OF ACCURACY TO BE OF SUCH MAGNITUDE
AND OF SO MANY PLACES E G THE 9TH POWER OF THE 9TH POWER OF 9 THAT

SATELLITES BY A RACE GIVEN IN SPECIES AND OF THE POSSIBLE SOCIAL AND
MORAL REDEMPTION OF SAID RACE BY A REDEEMER EASIER OF SOLUTION
OF A DIFFERENT ORDER OF DIFFICULTY
CONSCIOUS THAT THE HUMAN ORGANISM
NORMALLY CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING AN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OF 19 TONS
WHEN ELEVATED TO A CONSIDERABLE ALTITUDE IN THE TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERE
SUFFERED WITH ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION OF INTENSITY ACCORDING AS
THE LINE OF DEMARCATION BETWEEN TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE WAS
APPROXIMATED FROM NASAL HEMORRHAGE IMPEDED RESPIRATION AND VERTIGO
WHEN PROPOSING THIS PROBLEM FOR SOLUTION HE HAD CONJECTURED AS A
WORKING HYPOTHESIS WHICH COULD NOT BE PROVED IMPOSSIBLE THAT A MORE
ADAPTABLE AND DIFFERENTLY ANATOMICALLY CONSTRUCTED RACE OF BEINGS MIGHT
SUBSIST OTHERWISE UNDER MARTIAN MERCURIAL VENERAL JOVIAN SATURNIAN
NEPTUNIAN OR URANIAN SUFFICIENT AND EQUIVALENT CONDITIONS THOUGH
AN APOGEAN HUMANITY OF BEINGS CREATED IN VARYING FORMS WITH FINITE
DIFFERENCES RESULTING SIMILAR TO THE WHOLE AND TO ONE ANOTHER WOULD

HIS BLOOM'S LOGICAL CONCLUSION HAVING WEIGHED THE MATTER AND ALLOWING
FOR POSSIBLE ERROR
THAT IT WAS NOT A HEAVENTREE NOT A HEAVENGROT NOT A HEAVENBEAST NOT
A HEAVENMAN
THAT IT WAS A UTOPIA THERE BEING NO KNOWN METHOD FROM
THE KNOWN TO THE UNKNOWN AN INFINITY RENDERABLE EQUALLY FINITE BY THE
SUPPOSITIOUS APPOSITION OF ONE OR MORE BODIES EQUALLY OF THE SAME AND OF
DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES A MOBILITY OF ILLUSORY FORMS IMMOBILISED IN SPACE
REMOBILISED IN AIR A PAST WHICH POSSIBLY HAD CEASED TO EXIST AS A
PRESENT BEFORE ITS PROBABLE SPECTATORS HAD ENTERED ACTUAL PRESENT
EXISTENCE
WAS HE MORE CONVINCED OF THE ESTHETIC VALUE OF THE SPECTACLE
INDUBITABLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE REITERATED EXAMPLES OF POETS IN THE
DELIRIUM OF THE FRENZY OF ATTACHMENT OR IN THE ABASEMENT OF REJECTION
INVOKING ARDENT SYMPATHETIC CONSTELLATIONS OR THE FRIGIDITY OF THE
SATELLITE OF THEIR PLANET
DID HE THEN ACCEPT AS AN ARTICLE OF BELIEF THE THEORY OF ASTROLOGICAL
INFLUENCES UPON SUBLUNARY DISASTERS
IT SEEMED TO HIM AS POSSIBLE OF PROOF AS OF CONFUTATION AND THE
NOMENCLATURE EMPLOYED IN ITS SELENOGRAPHICAL CHARTS AS ATTRIBUTABLE TO
VERIFIABLE INTUITION AS TO FALLACIOUS ANALOGY THE LAKE OF DREAMS THE
SEA OF RAINS THE GULF OF DEWS THE OCEAN OF FECUNDITY

OF HIS FATHERS I WONDER IS HE AWAKE THINKING OF ME OR DREAMING AM I IN

DRINK NOT WHISKY OR STOUT OR PERHAPS THE SWEETY KIND OF PASTE THEY STICK
THEIR BILLS UP WITH SOME LIQUEUR ID LIKE TO SIP THOSE RICHLOOKING GREEN

KEEP HIMSELF FROM FALLING ASLEEP AFTER THE LAST TIME AFTER WE TOOK THE
PORT AND POTTED MEAT IT HAD A FINE SALTY TASTE YES BECAUSE I FELT LOVELY
AND TIRED MYSELF AND FELL ASLEEP AS SOUND AS A TOP THE MOMENT I POPPED
STRAIGHT INTO BED TILL THAT THUNDER WOKE ME UP GOD BE MERCIFUL TO US
I THOUGHT THE HEAVENS WERE COMING DOWN ABOUT US TO PUNISH US WHEN I
BLESSED MYSELF AND SAID A HAIL MARY LIKE THOSE AWFUL THUNDERBOLTS IN
GIBRALTAR AS IF THE WORLD WAS COMING TO AN END AND THEN THEY COME AND
TELL YOU THERES NO GOD WHAT COULD YOU DO IF IT WAS RUNNING AND RUSHING
ABOUT NOTHING ONLY MAKE AN ACT OF CONTRITION THE CANDLE I LIT THAT
EVENING IN WHITEFRIARS STREET CHAPEL FOR THE MONTH OF MAY SEE IT BROUGHT
ITS LUCK THOUGH HED SCOFF IF HE HEARD BECAUSE HE NEVER GOES TO CHURCH
MASS OR MEETING HE SAYS YOUR SOUL YOU HAVE NO SOUL INSIDE ONLY GREY
MATTER BECAUSE HE DOESNT KNOW WHAT IT IS TO HAVE ONE YES WHEN I LIT THE
LAMP BECAUSE HE MUST HAVE COME 3 OR 4 TIMES WITH THAT TREMENDOUS BIG RED
BRUTE OF A THING HE HAS I THOUGHT THE VEIN OR WHATEVER THE DICKENS THEY
CALL IT WAS GOING TO BURST THOUGH HIS NOSE IS NOT SO BIG AFTER I TOOK
OFF ALL MY THINGS WITH THE BLINDS DOWN AFTER MY HOURS DRESSING AND
PERFUMING AND COMBING IT LIKE IRON OR SOME KIND OF A THICK CROWBAR
STANDING ALL THE TIME HE MUST HAVE EATEN OYSTERS I THINK A FEW DOZEN HE
WAS IN GREAT SINGING VOICE NO I NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE FELT ANYONE HAD
ONE THE SIZE OF THAT TO MAKE YOU FEEL FULL UP HE MUST HAVE EATEN A WHOLE
SHEEP AFTER WHATS THE IDEA MAKING US LIKE THAT WITH A BIG HOLE IN THE
MIDDLE OF US OR LIKE A STALLION DRIVING IT UP INTO YOU BECAUSE THATS ALL
THEY WANT OUT OF YOU WITH THAT DETERMINED VICIOUS LOOK IN HIS EYE I HAD
TO HALFSHUT MY EYES STILL HE HASNT SUCH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SPUNK IN
HIM WHEN I MADE HIM PULL OUT AND DO IT ON ME CONSIDERING HOW BIG IT IS
SO MUCH THE BETTER IN CASE ANY OF IT WASNT WASHED OUT PROPERLY THE LAST
TIME I LET HIM FINISH IT IN ME NICE INVENTION THEY MADE FOR WOMEN FOR
HIM TO GET ALL THE PLEASURE BUT IF SOMEONE GAVE THEM A TOUCH OF IT
THEMSELVES THEYD KNOW WHAT I WENT THROUGH WITH MILLY NOBODY WOULD
BELIEVE CUTTING HER TEETH TOO AND MINA PUREFOYS HUSBAND GIVE US A SWING
OUT OF YOUR WHISKERS FILLING HER UP WITH A CHILD OR TWINS ONCE A YEAR
AS REGULAR AS THE CLOCK ALWAYS WITH A SMELL OF CHILDREN OFF HER THE ONE
THEY CALLED BUDGERS OR SOMETHING LIKE A NIGGER WITH A SHOCK OF HAIR ON

ELEPHANTS OR I DONT KNOW WHAT SUPPOSING I RISKED HAVING ANOTHER NOT OFF
HIM THOUGH STILL IF HE WAS MARRIED IM SURE HED HAVE A FINE STRONG CHILD

I SUPPOSE IT WAS MEETING JOSIE POWELL AND THE FUNERAL AND THINKING ABOUT
ME AND BOYLAN SET HIM OFF WELL HE CAN THINK WHAT HE LIKES NOW IF THATLL
DO HIM ANY GOOD I KNOW THEY WERE SPOONING A BIT WHEN I CAME ON THE SCENE
HE WAS DANCING AND SITTING OUT WITH HER THE NIGHT OF GEORGINA SIMPSONS
HOUSEWARMING AND THEN HE WANTED TO RAM IT DOWN MY NECK IT WAS ON ACCOUNT
OF NOT LIKING TO SEE HER A WALLFLOWER THAT WAS WHY WE HAD THE STANDUP
ROW OVER POLITICS HE BEGAN IT NOT ME WHEN HE SAID ABOUT OUR LORD BEING A
CARPENTER AT LAST HE MADE ME CRY OF COURSE A WOMAN IS SO SENSITIVE ABOUT
EVERYTHING I WAS FUMING WITH MYSELF AFTER FOR GIVING IN ONLY FOR I KNEW
HE WAS GONE ON ME AND THE FIRST SOCIALIST HE SAID HE WAS HE ANNOYED ME
SO MUCH I COULDNT PUT HIM INTO A TEMPER STILL HE KNOWS A LOT OF MIXEDUP
THINGS ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE BODY AND THE INSIDE I OFTEN WANTED TO STUDY
UP THAT MYSELF WHAT WE HAVE INSIDE US IN THAT FAMILY PHYSICIAN I COULD
ALWAYS HEAR HIS VOICE TALKING WHEN THE ROOM WAS CROWDED AND WATCH HIM
AFTER THAT I PRETENDED I HAD A COOLNESS ON WITH HER OVER HIM BECAUSE HE
USED TO BE A BIT ON THE JEALOUS SIDE WHENEVER HE ASKED WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO AND I SAID OVER TO FLOEY AND HE MADE ME THE PRESENT OF BYRON'S POEMS
AND THE THREE PAIRS OF GLOVES SO THAT FINISHED THAT I COULD QUITE EASILY
GET HIM TO MAKE IT UP ANY TIME I KNOW HOW ID EVEN SUPPOSING HE GOT IN
WITH HER AGAIN AND WAS GOING OUT TO SEE HER SOMEWHERE ID KNOW IF HE
REFUSED TO EAT THE ONIONS I KNOW PLENTY OF WAYS ASK HIM TO TUCK DOWN THE
COLLAR OF MY BLOUSE OR TOUCH HIM WITH MY VEIL AND GLOVES ON GOING OUT I
KISS THEN WOULD SEND THEM ALL SPINNING HOWEVER ALRIGHT WELL SEE THEN LET
HIM GO TO HER SHE OF COURSE WOULD ONLY BE TOO DELIGHTED TO PRETEND SHES
MAD IN LOVE WITH HIM THAT I WOULDNT SO MUCH MIND ID JUST GO TO HER AND
ASK HER DO YOU LOVE HIM AND LOOK HER SQUARE IN THE EYES SHE COULDNT FOOL
ME BUT HE MIGHT IMAGINE HE WAS AND MAKE A DECLARATION TO HER WITH HIS
PLABBERY KIND OF A MANNER LIKE HE DID TO ME THOUGH I HAD THE DEVILS OWN
JOB TO GET IT OUT OF HIM THOUGH I LIKED HIM FOR THAT IT SHOWED HE COULD
HOLD IN AND WASNT TO BE GOT FOR THE ASKING HE WAS ON THE POP OF ASKING
ME TOO THE NIGHT IN THE KITCHEN I WAS ROLLING THE POTATO CAKE THERES
SOMETHING I WANT TO SAY TO YOU ONLY FOR I PUT HIM OFF LETTING ON I WAS
IN A TEMPER WITH MY HANDS AND ARMS FULL OF PASTY FLOUR IN ANY CASE I LET
OUT TOO MUCH THE NIGHT BEFORE TALKING OF DREAMS SO I DIDNT WANT TO LET
HIM KNOW MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM SHE USED TO BE ALWAYS EMBRACING ME
JOSIE WHENEVER HE WAS THERE MEANING HIM OF COURSE GLAUMING ME OVER AND
WHEN I SAID I WASHED UP AND DOWN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ASKING ME AND DID
YOU WASH POSSIBLE THE WOMEN ARE ALWAYS EGGING ON TO THAT PUTTING IT ON
THICK WHEN HES THERE THEY KNOW BY HIS SLY EYE BLINKING A BIT PUTTING ON
THE INDIFFERENT WHEN THEY COME OUT WITH SOMETHING THE KIND HE IS WHAT
SPOILS HIM I DONT WONDER IN THE LEAST BECAUSE HE WAS VERY HANDSOME AT
THAT TIME TRYING TO LOOK LIKE LORD BYRON I SAID I LIKED THOUGH HE
WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL FOR A MAN AND HE WAS A LITTLE BEFORE WE GOT ENGAGED
AFTERWARDS THOUGH SHE DIDNT LIKE IT SO MUCH THE DAY I WAS IN FITS OF
LAUGHING WITH THE GIGGLES I COULDNT STOP ABOUT ALL MY HAIRPINS FALLING
OUT ONE AFTER ANOTHER WITH THE MASS OF HAIR I HAD YOURE ALWAYS IN GREAT
HUMOUR SHE SAID YES BECAUSE IT GRIGGED HER BECAUSE SHE KNEW WHAT IT
MEANT BECAUSE I USED TO TELL HER A GOOD BIT OF WHAT WENT ON BETWEEN US
NOT ALL BUT JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE HER MOUTH WATER BUT THAT WASNT MY FAULT
SHE DIDNT DARKEN THE DOOR MUCH AFTER WE WERE MARRIED I WONDER WHAT SHES
GOT LIKE NOW AFTER LIVING WITH THAT DOTTY HUSBAND OF HERS SHE HAD HER
FACE BEGINNING TO LOOK DRAWN AND RUN DOWN THE LAST TIME I SAW HER SHE
MUST HAVE BEEN JUST AFTER A ROW WITH HIM BECAUSE I SAW ON THE MOMENT SHE
WAS EDGING TO DRAW DOWN A CONVERSATION ABOUT HUSBANDS AND TALK ABOUT HIM
TO RUN HIM DOWN WHAT WAS IT SHE TOLD ME O YES THAT SOMETIMES HE USED TO
GO TO BED WITH HIS MUDDY BOOTS ON WHEN THE MAGGOT TAKES HIM JUST IMAGINE
HAVING TO GET INTO BED WITH A THING LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT MURDER YOU
ANY MOMENT WHAT A MAN WELL ITS NOT THE ONE WAY EVERYONE GOES MAD POLDY
ANYHOW WHATEVER HE DOES ALWAYS WIPES HIS FEET ON THE MAT WHEN HE COMES
IN WET OR SHINE AND ALWAYS BLACKS HIS OWN BOOTS TOO AND HE ALWAYS TAKES
OFF HIS HAT WHEN HE COMES UP IN THE STREET LIKE THEN AND NOW HES GOING
ABOUT IN HIS SLIPPERS TO LOOK FOR 10000 POUNDS FOR A POSTCARD U P UP

SURE THERES NOTHING FOR A WOMAN IN THAT ALL INVENTION MADE UP ABOUT HE
DRINKING THE CHAMPAGNE OUT OF HER SLIPPER AFTER THE BALL WAS OVER LIKE
THE INFANT JESUS IN THE CRIB AT INCHICORE IN THE BLESSED VIRGINS ARMS
SURE NO WOMAN COULD HAVE A CHILD THAT BIG TAKEN OUT OF HER AND I THOUGHT
FIRST IT CAME OUT OF HER SIDE BECAUSE HOW COULD SHE GO TO THE CHAMBER
WHEN SHE WANTED TO AND SHE A RICH LADY OF COURSE SHE FELT HONOURED H R H
HE WAS IN GIBRALTAR THE YEAR I WAS BORN I BET HE FOUND LILIES THERE TOO
WHERE HE PLANTED THE TREE HE PLANTED MORE THAN THAT IN HIS TIME HE MIGHT
HAVE PLANTED ME TOO IF HED COME A BIT SOONER THEN I WOULDNT BE HERE AS

HE KNOCKS OUT OF IT AND GO INTO AN OFFICE OR SOMETHING WHERE HED GET
REGULAR PAY OR A BANK WHERE THEY COULD PUT HIM UP ON A THRONE TO COUNT
THE MONEY ALL THE DAY OF COURSE HE PREFERS PLOTTERING ABOUT THE HOUSE

TO BE MOOCHING ABOUT FOR ADVERTISEMENTS WHEN HE COULD HAVE BEEN IN MR
CUFFES STILL ONLY FOR WHAT HE DID THEN SENDING ME TO TRY AND PATCH IT UP
