IT WAS IN THE SPRING OF THE YEAR 1894 THAT ALL LONDON WAS INTERESTED
AND THE FASHIONABLE WORLD DISMAYED BY THE MURDER OF THE HONOURABLE
RONALD ADAIR UNDER MOST UNUSUAL AND INEXPLICABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
THE
PUBLIC HAS ALREADY LEARNED THOSE PARTICULARS OF THE CRIME WHICH CAME OUT
IN THE POLICE INVESTIGATION BUT A GOOD DEAL WAS SUPPRESSED UPON THAT
OCCASION SINCE THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION WAS SO OVERWHELMINGLY
STRONG THAT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY TO BRING FORWARD ALL THE FACTS
ONLY
NOW AT THE END OF NEARLY TEN YEARS AM I ALLOWED TO SUPPLY THOSE
MISSING LINKS WHICH MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF THAT REMARKABLE CHAIN
THE
CRIME WAS OF INTEREST IN ITSELF BUT THAT INTEREST WAS AS NOTHING TO
ME COMPARED TO THE INCONCEIVABLE SEQUEL WHICH AFFORDED ME THE GREATEST
SHOCK AND SURPRISE OF ANY EVENT IN MY ADVENTUROUS LIFE
EVEN NOW
AFTER THIS LONG INTERVAL I FIND MYSELF THRILLING AS I THINK OF IT AND
FEELING ONCE MORE THAT SUDDEN FLOOD OF JOY AMAZEMENT AND INCREDULITY
WHICH UTTERLY SUBMERGED MY MIND
LET ME SAY TO THAT PUBLIC WHICH HAS
SHOWN SOME INTEREST IN THOSE GLIMPSES WHICH I HAVE OCCASIONALLY GIVEN
THEM OF THE THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS OF A VERY REMARKABLE MAN THAT THEY
ARE NOT TO BLAME ME IF I HAVE NOT SHARED MY KNOWLEDGE WITH THEM FOR I
SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED IT MY FIRST DUTY TO DO SO HAD I NOT BEEN BARRED
BY A POSITIVE PROHIBITION FROM HIS OWN LIPS WHICH WAS ONLY WITHDRAWN
UPON THE THIRD OF LAST MONTH
IT CAN BE IMAGINED THAT MY CLOSE INTIMACY WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD
INTERESTED ME DEEPLY IN CRIME AND THAT AFTER HIS DISAPPEARANCE I NEVER
FAILED TO READ WITH CARE THE VARIOUS PROBLEMS WHICH CAME BEFORE THE
PUBLIC
AND I EVEN ATTEMPTED MORE THAN ONCE FOR MY OWN PRIVATE
SATISFACTION TO EMPLOY HIS METHODS IN THEIR SOLUTION THOUGH WITH
INDIFFERENT SUCCESS
THERE WAS NONE HOWEVER WHICH APPEALED TO ME LIKE
THIS TRAGEDY OF RONALD ADAIR
AS I READ THE EVIDENCE AT THE INQUEST
WHICH LED UP TO A VERDICT OF WILLFUL MURDER AGAINST SOME PERSON OR
PERSONS UNKNOWN I REALIZED MORE CLEARLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE THE LOSS
WHICH THE COMMUNITY HAD SUSTAINED BY THE DEATH OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
THERE
WERE POINTS ABOUT THIS STRANGE BUSINESS WHICH WOULD I WAS SURE HAVE
SPECIALLY APPEALED TO HIM AND THE EFFORTS OF THE POLICE WOULD HAVE BEEN
SUPPLEMENTED OR MORE PROBABLY ANTICIPATED BY THE TRAINED OBSERVATION
AND THE ALERT MIND OF THE FIRST CRIMINAL AGENT IN EUROPE
ALL DAY AS
I DROVE UPON MY ROUND I TURNED OVER THE CASE IN MY MIND AND FOUND NO
EXPLANATION WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO BE ADEQUATE
AT THE RISK OF TELLING
A TWICE TOLD TALE I WILL RECAPITULATE THE FACTS AS THEY WERE KNOWN TO
THE PUBLIC AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INQUEST
THE HONOURABLE RONALD ADAIR WAS THE SECOND SON OF THE EARL OF MAYNOOTH
AT THAT TIME GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE AUSTRALIAN COLONIES
ADAIR'S MOTHER
HAD RETURNED FROM AUSTRALIA TO UNDERGO THE OPERATION FOR CATARACT AND
SHE HER SON RONALD AND HER DAUGHTER HILDA WERE LIVING TOGETHER AT
427 PARK LANE
THE YOUTH MOVED IN THE BEST SOCIETY HAD SO FAR AS WAS
KNOWN NO ENEMIES AND NO PARTICULAR VICES
HE HAD BEEN ENGAGED TO MISS
EDITH WOODLEY OF CARSTAIRS BUT THE ENGAGEMENT HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF BY
MUTUAL CONSENT SOME MONTHS BEFORE AND THERE WAS NO SIGN THAT IT HAD
LEFT ANY VERY PROFOUND FEELING BEHIND IT
FOR THE REST SIC THE MAN'S
LIFE MOVED IN A NARROW AND CONVENTIONAL CIRCLE FOR HIS HABITS WERE
QUIET AND HIS NATURE UNEMOTIONAL
YET IT WAS UPON THIS EASY GOING YOUNG
ARISTOCRAT THAT DEATH CAME IN MOST STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED FORM BETWEEN
THE HOURS OF TEN AND ELEVEN TWENTY ON THE NIGHT OF MARCH 30 1894
RONALD ADAIR WAS FOND OF CARDS PLAYING CONTINUALLY BUT NEVER FOR SUCH
STAKES AS WOULD HURT HIM
HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE BALDWIN THE CAVENDISH
AND THE BAGATELLE CARD CLUBS
IT WAS SHOWN THAT AFTER DINNER ON THE DAY
OF HIS DEATH HE HAD PLAYED A RUBBER OF WHIST AT THE LATTER CLUB
HE HAD
ALSO PLAYED THERE IN THE AFTERNOON
THE EVIDENCE OF THOSE WHO HAD PLAYED
WITH HIM MR
MURRAY SIR JOHN HARDY AND COLONEL MORAN SHOWED THAT
THE GAME WAS WHIST AND THAT THERE WAS A FAIRLY EQUAL FALL OF THE CARDS
ADAIR MIGHT HAVE LOST FIVE POUNDS BUT NOT MORE
HIS FORTUNE WAS A
CONSIDERABLE ONE AND SUCH A LOSS COULD NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT HIM
HE
HAD PLAYED NEARLY EVERY DAY AT ONE CLUB OR OTHER BUT HE WAS A CAUTIOUS
PLAYER AND USUALLY ROSE A WINNER
IT CAME OUT IN EVIDENCE THAT IN
PARTNERSHIP WITH COLONEL MORAN HE HAD ACTUALLY WON AS MUCH AS FOUR
HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS IN A SITTING SOME WEEKS BEFORE FROM GODFREY
MILNER AND LORD BALMORAL
SO MUCH FOR HIS RECENT HISTORY AS IT CAME OUT
AT THE INQUEST
ON THE EVENING OF THE CRIME HE RETURNED FROM THE CLUB EXACTLY AT TEN
HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE OUT SPENDING THE EVENING WITH A RELATION
THE
SERVANT DEPOSED THAT SHE HEARD HIM ENTER THE FRONT ROOM ON THE SECOND
FLOOR GENERALLY USED AS HIS SITTING ROOM
SHE HAD LIT A FIRE THERE AND
AS IT SMOKED SHE HAD OPENED THE WINDOW
NO SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE ROOM
UNTIL ELEVEN TWENTY THE HOUR OF THE RETURN OF LADY MAYNOOTH AND HER
DAUGHTER
DESIRING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT SHE ATTEMPTED TO ENTER HER SON'S
ROOM
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED ON THE INSIDE AND NO ANSWER COULD BE GOT TO
THEIR CRIES AND KNOCKING
HELP WAS OBTAINED AND THE DOOR FORCED
THE
UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN WAS FOUND LYING NEAR THE TABLE
HIS HEAD HAD BEEN
HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY AN EXPANDING REVOLVER BULLET BUT NO WEAPON OF ANY
SORT WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE ROOM
ON THE TABLE LAY TWO BANKNOTES FOR
TEN POUNDS EACH AND SEVENTEEN POUNDS TEN IN SILVER AND GOLD THE MONEY
ARRANGED IN LITTLE PILES OF VARYING AMOUNT
THERE WERE SOME FIGURES ALSO
UPON A SHEET OF PAPER WITH THE NAMES OF SOME CLUB FRIENDS OPPOSITE
TO THEM FROM WHICH IT WAS CONJECTURED THAT BEFORE HIS DEATH HE WAS
ENDEAVOURING TO MAKE OUT HIS LOSSES OR WINNINGS AT CARDS
A MINUTE EXAMINATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SERVED ONLY TO MAKE THE CASE
MORE COMPLEX
IN THE FIRST PLACE NO REASON COULD BE GIVEN WHY THE
YOUNG MAN SHOULD HAVE FASTENED THE DOOR UPON THE INSIDE
THERE WAS THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THE MURDERER HAD DONE THIS AND HAD AFTERWARDS ESCAPED
BY THE WINDOW
THE DROP WAS AT LEAST TWENTY FEET HOWEVER AND A BED OF
CROCUSES IN FULL BLOOM LAY BENEATH
NEITHER THE FLOWERS NOR THE EARTH
SHOWED ANY SIGN OF HAVING BEEN DISTURBED NOR WERE THERE ANY MARKS
UPON THE NARROW STRIP OF GRASS WHICH SEPARATED THE HOUSE FROM THE ROAD
APPARENTLY THEREFORE IT WAS THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF WHO HAD FASTENED THE
DOOR
BUT HOW DID HE COME BY HIS DEATH NO ONE COULD HAVE CLIMBED UP TO
THE WINDOW WITHOUT LEAVING TRACES
SUPPOSE A MAN HAD FIRED THROUGH THE
WINDOW HE WOULD INDEED BE A REMARKABLE SHOT WHO COULD WITH A
REVOLVER INFLICT SO DEADLY A WOUND
AGAIN PARK LANE IS A FREQUENTED
THOROUGHFARE THERE IS A CAB STAND WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE HOUSE
NO ONE HAD HEARD A SHOT
AND YET THERE WAS THE DEAD MAN AND THERE THE
REVOLVER BULLET WHICH HAD MUSHROOMED OUT AS SOFT NOSED BULLETS WILL
AND SO INFLICTED A WOUND WHICH MUST HAVE CAUSED INSTANTANEOUS DEATH
SUCH WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARK LANE MYSTERY WHICH WERE FURTHER
COMPLICATED BY ENTIRE ABSENCE OF MOTIVE SINCE AS I HAVE SAID YOUNG
ADAIR WAS NOT KNOWN TO HAVE ANY ENEMY AND NO ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO
REMOVE THE MONEY OR VALUABLES IN THE ROOM
ALL DAY I TURNED THESE FACTS OVER IN MY MIND ENDEAVOURING TO HIT UPON
SOME THEORY WHICH COULD RECONCILE THEM ALL AND TO FIND THAT LINE
OF LEAST RESISTANCE WHICH MY POOR FRIEND HAD DECLARED TO BE THE
STARTING POINT OF EVERY INVESTIGATION
I CONFESS THAT I MADE LITTLE
PROGRESS
IN THE EVENING I STROLLED ACROSS THE PARK AND FOUND MYSELF
ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK AT THE OXFORD STREET END OF PARK LANE
A GROUP OF
LOAFERS UPON THE PAVEMENTS ALL STARING UP AT A PARTICULAR WINDOW
DIRECTED ME TO THE HOUSE WHICH I HAD COME TO SEE
A TALL THIN MAN WITH
COLOURED GLASSES WHOM I STRONGLY SUSPECTED OF BEING A PLAIN CLOTHES
DETECTIVE WAS POINTING OUT SOME THEORY OF HIS OWN WHILE THE OTHERS
CROWDED ROUND TO LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID
I GOT AS NEAR HIM AS I COULD
BUT HIS OBSERVATIONS SEEMED TO ME TO BE ABSURD SO I WITHDREW AGAIN IN
SOME DISGUST
AS I DID SO I STRUCK AGAINST AN ELDERLY DEFORMED MAN
WHO HAD BEEN BEHIND ME AND I KNOCKED DOWN SEVERAL BOOKS WHICH HE WAS
CARRYING
I REMEMBER THAT AS I PICKED THEM UP I OBSERVED THE TITLE
OF ONE OF THEM THE ORIGIN OF TREE WORSHIP AND IT STRUCK ME THAT THE
FELLOW MUST BE SOME POOR BIBLIOPHILE WHO EITHER AS A TRADE OR AS A
HOBBY WAS A COLLECTOR OF OBSCURE VOLUMES
I ENDEAVOURED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE ACCIDENT BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THESE BOOKS WHICH I HAD SO
UNFORTUNATELY MALTREATED WERE VERY PRECIOUS OBJECTS IN THE EYES OF THEIR
OWNER
WITH A SNARL OF CONTEMPT HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND I SAW HIS
CURVED BACK AND WHITE SIDE WHISKERS DISAPPEAR AMONG THE THRONG
MY OBSERVATIONS OF NO
427 PARK LANE DID LITTLE TO CLEAR UP THE PROBLEM
IN WHICH I WAS INTERESTED
THE HOUSE WAS SEPARATED FROM THE STREET BY
A LOW WALL AND RAILING THE WHOLE NOT MORE THAN FIVE FEET HIGH
IT WAS
PERFECTLY EASY THEREFORE FOR ANYONE TO GET INTO THE GARDEN BUT
THE WINDOW WAS ENTIRELY INACCESSIBLE SINCE THERE WAS NO WATERPIPE OR
ANYTHING WHICH COULD HELP THE MOST ACTIVE MAN TO CLIMB IT
MORE PUZZLED
THAN EVER I RETRACED MY STEPS TO KENSINGTON
I HAD NOT BEEN IN MY STUDY
FIVE MINUTES WHEN THE MAID ENTERED TO SAY THAT A PERSON DESIRED TO
SEE ME
TO MY ASTONISHMENT IT WAS NONE OTHER THAN MY STRANGE OLD BOOK
COLLECTOR HIS SHARP WIZENED FACE PEERING OUT FROM A FRAME OF WHITE
HAIR AND HIS PRECIOUS VOLUMES A DOZEN OF THEM AT LEAST WEDGED UNDER
HIS RIGHT ARM
YOU'RE SURPRISED TO SEE ME SIR SAID HE IN A STRANGE CROAKING
VOICE
I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT I WAS
WELL I'VE A CONSCIENCE SIR AND WHEN I CHANCED TO SEE YOU GO INTO
THIS HOUSE AS I CAME HOBBLING AFTER YOU I THOUGHT TO MYSELF I'LL JUST
STEP IN AND SEE THAT KIND GENTLEMAN AND TELL HIM THAT IF I WAS A BIT
GRUFF IN MY MANNER THERE WAS NOT ANY HARM MEANT AND THAT I AM MUCH
OBLIGED TO HIM FOR PICKING UP MY BOOKS
YOU MAKE TOO MUCH OF A TRIFLE SAID I
MAY I ASK HOW YOU KNEW WHO I
WAS
WELL SIR IF IT ISN'T TOO GREAT A LIBERTY I AM A NEIGHBOUR OF YOURS
FOR YOU'LL FIND MY LITTLE BOOKSHOP AT THE CORNER OF CHURCH STREET
AND VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU I AM SURE
MAYBE YOU COLLECT YOURSELF SIR
HERE'S BRITISH BIRDS AND CATULLUS AND THE HOLY WAR A BARGAIN EVERY
ONE OF THEM
WITH FIVE VOLUMES YOU COULD JUST FILL THAT GAP ON THAT
SECOND SHELF
IT LOOKS UNTIDY DOES IT NOT SIR
I MOVED MY HEAD TO LOOK AT THE CABINET BEHIND ME
WHEN I TURNED AGAIN
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS STANDING SMILING AT ME ACROSS MY STUDY TABLE
I ROSE
TO MY FEET STARED AT HIM FOR SOME SECONDS IN UTTER AMAZEMENT AND THEN
IT APPEARS THAT I MUST HAVE FAINTED FOR THE FIRST AND THE LAST TIME
IN MY LIFE
CERTAINLY A GRAY MIST SWIRLED BEFORE MY EYES AND WHEN IT
CLEARED I FOUND MY COLLAR ENDS UNDONE AND THE TINGLING AFTER TASTE OF
BRANDY UPON MY LIPS
HOLMES WAS BENDING OVER MY CHAIR HIS FLASK IN HIS
HAND
MY DEAR WATSON SAID THE WELL REMEMBERED VOICE I OWE YOU A THOUSAND
APOLOGIES
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU WOULD BE SO AFFECTED
I GRIPPED HIM BY THE ARMS
HOLMES I CRIED
IS IT REALLY YOU CAN IT INDEED BE THAT YOU ARE
ALIVE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU SUCCEEDED IN CLIMBING OUT OF THAT AWFUL
ABYSS
WAIT A MOMENT SAID HE
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU ARE REALLY FIT TO
DISCUSS THINGS I HAVE GIVEN YOU A SERIOUS SHOCK BY MY UNNECESSARILY
DRAMATIC REAPPEARANCE
I AM ALL RIGHT BUT INDEED HOLMES I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES
GOOD
HEAVENS TO THINK THAT YOU YOU OF ALL MEN SHOULD BE STANDING IN MY
STUDY AGAIN I GRIPPED HIM BY THE SLEEVE AND FELT THE THIN SINEWY ARM
BENEATH IT
WELL YOU'RE NOT A SPIRIT ANYHOW SAID I
MY DEAR CHAP
I'M OVERJOYED TO SEE YOU
SIT DOWN AND TELL ME HOW YOU CAME ALIVE OUT
OF THAT DREADFUL CHASM
HE SAT OPPOSITE TO ME AND LIT A CIGARETTE IN HIS OLD NONCHALANT
MANNER
HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SEEDY FROCKCOAT OF THE BOOK MERCHANT BUT
THE REST OF THAT INDIVIDUAL LAY IN A PILE OF WHITE HAIR AND OLD BOOKS
UPON THE TABLE
HOLMES LOOKED EVEN THINNER AND KEENER THAN OF OLD BUT
THERE WAS A DEAD WHITE TINGE IN HIS AQUILINE FACE WHICH TOLD ME THAT HIS
LIFE RECENTLY HAD NOT BEEN A HEALTHY ONE
I AM GLAD TO STRETCH MYSELF WATSON SAID HE
IT IS NO JOKE WHEN A
TALL MAN HAS TO TAKE A FOOT OFF HIS STATURE FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON END
NOW MY DEAR FELLOW IN THE MATTER OF THESE EXPLANATIONS WE HAVE IF I
MAY ASK FOR YOUR COOPERATION A HARD AND DANGEROUS NIGHT'S WORK IN FRONT
OF US
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I GAVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE WHOLE
SITUATION WHEN THAT WORK IS FINISHED
I AM FULL OF CURIOSITY
I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO HEAR NOW
YOU'LL COME WITH ME TO NIGHT
WHEN YOU LIKE AND WHERE YOU LIKE
THIS IS INDEED LIKE THE OLD DAYS
WE SHALL HAVE TIME FOR A MOUTHFUL
OF DINNER BEFORE WE NEED GO
WELL THEN ABOUT THAT CHASM
I HAD NO
SERIOUS DIFFICULTY IN GETTING OUT OF IT FOR THE VERY SIMPLE REASON THAT
I NEVER WAS IN IT
YOU NEVER WERE IN IT
NO WATSON I NEVER WAS IN IT
MY NOTE TO YOU WAS ABSOLUTELY GENUINE
I HAD LITTLE DOUBT THAT I HAD COME TO THE END OF MY CAREER WHEN I
PERCEIVED THE SOMEWHAT SINISTER FIGURE OF THE LATE PROFESSOR MORIARTY
STANDING UPON THE NARROW PATHWAY WHICH LED TO SAFETY
I READ AN
INEXORABLE PURPOSE IN HIS GRAY EYES
I EXCHANGED SOME REMARKS WITH HIM
THEREFORE AND OBTAINED HIS COURTEOUS PERMISSION TO WRITE THE SHORT NOTE
WHICH YOU AFTERWARDS RECEIVED
I LEFT IT WITH MY CIGARETTE BOX AND MY
STICK AND I WALKED ALONG THE PATHWAY MORIARTY STILL AT MY HEELS
WHEN
I REACHED THE END I STOOD AT BAY
HE DREW NO WEAPON BUT HE RUSHED AT ME
AND THREW HIS LONG ARMS AROUND ME
HE KNEW THAT HIS OWN GAME WAS UP AND
WAS ONLY ANXIOUS TO REVENGE HIMSELF UPON ME
WE TOTTERED TOGETHER UPON
THE BRINK OF THE FALL
I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER OF BARITSU OR
THE JAPANESE SYSTEM OF WRESTLING WHICH HAS MORE THAN ONCE BEEN VERY
USEFUL TO ME
I SLIPPED THROUGH HIS GRIP AND HE WITH A HORRIBLE SCREAM
KICKED MADLY FOR A FEW SECONDS AND CLAWED THE AIR WITH BOTH HIS HANDS
BUT FOR ALL HIS EFFORTS HE COULD NOT GET HIS BALANCE AND OVER HE WENT
WITH MY FACE OVER THE BRINK I SAW HIM FALL FOR A LONG WAY
THEN HE
STRUCK A ROCK BOUNDED OFF AND SPLASHED INTO THE WATER
I LISTENED WITH AMAZEMENT TO THIS EXPLANATION WHICH HOLMES DELIVERED
BETWEEN THE PUFFS OF HIS CIGARETTE
BUT THE TRACKS I CRIED
I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES THAT TWO WENT DOWN
THE PATH AND NONE RETURNED
IT CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY
THE INSTANT THAT THE PROFESSOR HAD
DISAPPEARED IT STRUCK ME WHAT A REALLY EXTRAORDINARILY LUCKY CHANCE
FATE HAD PLACED IN MY WAY
I KNEW THAT MORIARTY WAS NOT THE ONLY MAN WHO
HAD SWORN MY DEATH
THERE WERE AT LEAST THREE OTHERS WHOSE DESIRE FOR
VENGEANCE UPON ME WOULD ONLY BE INCREASED BY THE DEATH OF THEIR LEADER
THEY WERE ALL MOST DANGEROUS MEN
ONE OR OTHER WOULD CERTAINLY GET ME
ON THE OTHER HAND IF ALL THE WORLD WAS CONVINCED THAT I WAS DEAD THEY
WOULD TAKE LIBERTIES THESE MEN THEY WOULD SOON LAY THEMSELVES OPEN
AND SOONER OR LATER I COULD DESTROY THEM
THEN IT WOULD BE TIME FOR ME
TO ANNOUNCE THAT I WAS STILL IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING
SO RAPIDLY DOES
THE BRAIN ACT THAT I BELIEVE I HAD THOUGHT THIS ALL OUT BEFORE PROFESSOR
MORIARTY HAD REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE REICHENBACH FALL
I STOOD UP AND EXAMINED THE ROCKY WALL BEHIND ME
IN YOUR PICTURESQUE
ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER WHICH I READ WITH GREAT INTEREST SOME MONTHS
LATER YOU ASSERT THAT THE WALL WAS SHEER
THAT WAS NOT LITERALLY
TRUE
A FEW SMALL FOOTHOLDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND THERE WAS SOME
INDICATION OF A LEDGE
THE CLIFF IS SO HIGH THAT TO CLIMB IT ALL WAS
AN OBVIOUS IMPOSSIBILITY AND IT WAS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE MY WAY
ALONG THE WET PATH WITHOUT LEAVING SOME TRACKS
I MIGHT IT IS TRUE
HAVE REVERSED MY BOOTS AS I HAVE DONE ON SIMILAR OCCASIONS BUT THE
SIGHT OF THREE SETS OF TRACKS IN ONE DIRECTION WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
SUGGESTED A DECEPTION
ON THE WHOLE THEN IT WAS BEST THAT I SHOULD
RISK THE CLIMB
IT WAS NOT A PLEASANT BUSINESS WATSON
THE FALL ROARED
BENEATH ME
I AM NOT A FANCIFUL PERSON BUT I GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT
I SEEMED TO HEAR MORIARTY'S VOICE SCREAMING AT ME OUT OF THE ABYSS
A
MISTAKE WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL
MORE THAN ONCE AS TUFTS OF GRASS CAME
OUT IN MY HAND OR MY FOOT SLIPPED IN THE WET NOTCHES OF THE ROCK I
THOUGHT THAT I WAS GONE
BUT I STRUGGLED UPWARD AND AT LAST I REACHED A
LEDGE SEVERAL FEET DEEP AND COVERED WITH SOFT GREEN MOSS WHERE I COULD
LIE UNSEEN IN THE MOST PERFECT COMFORT
THERE I WAS STRETCHED WHEN
YOU MY DEAR WATSON AND ALL YOUR FOLLOWING WERE INVESTIGATING IN THE
MOST SYMPATHETIC AND INEFFICIENT MANNER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY DEATH
AT LAST WHEN YOU HAD ALL FORMED YOUR INEVITABLE AND TOTALLY ERRONEOUS
CONCLUSIONS YOU DEPARTED FOR THE HOTEL AND I WAS LEFT ALONE
I
HAD IMAGINED THAT I HAD REACHED THE END OF MY ADVENTURES BUT A VERY
UNEXPECTED OCCURRENCE SHOWED ME THAT THERE WERE SURPRISES STILL IN STORE
FOR ME
A HUGE ROCK FALLING FROM ABOVE BOOMED PAST ME STRUCK THE
PATH AND BOUNDED OVER INTO THE CHASM
FOR AN INSTANT I THOUGHT THAT
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT BUT A MOMENT LATER LOOKING UP I SAW A MAN'S HEAD
AGAINST THE DARKENING SKY AND ANOTHER STONE STRUCK THE VERY LEDGE UPON
WHICH I WAS STRETCHED WITHIN A FOOT OF MY HEAD
OF COURSE THE MEANING
OF THIS WAS OBVIOUS
MORIARTY HAD NOT BEEN ALONE
A CONFEDERATE AND
EVEN THAT ONE GLANCE HAD TOLD ME HOW DANGEROUS A MAN THAT CONFEDERATE
WAS HAD KEPT GUARD WHILE THE PROFESSOR HAD ATTACKED ME
FROM A
DISTANCE UNSEEN BY ME HE HAD BEEN A WITNESS OF HIS FRIEND'S DEATH AND
OF MY ESCAPE
HE HAD WAITED AND THEN MAKING HIS WAY ROUND TO THE TOP OF
THE CLIFF HE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO SUCCEED WHERE HIS COMRADE HAD FAILED
I DID NOT TAKE LONG TO THINK ABOUT IT WATSON
AGAIN I SAW THAT GRIM
FACE LOOK OVER THE CLIFF AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS THE PRECURSOR OF
ANOTHER STONE
I SCRAMBLED DOWN ON TO THE PATH
I DON'T THINK I COULD
HAVE DONE IT IN COLD BLOOD
IT WAS A HUNDRED TIMES MORE DIFFICULT THAN
GETTING UP
BUT I HAD NO TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER FOR ANOTHER STONE
SANG PAST ME AS I HUNG BY MY HANDS FROM THE EDGE OF THE LEDGE
HALFWAY
DOWN I SLIPPED BUT BY THE BLESSING OF GOD I LANDED TORN AND
BLEEDING UPON THE PATH
I TOOK TO MY HEELS DID TEN MILES OVER THE
MOUNTAINS IN THE DARKNESS AND A WEEK LATER I FOUND MYSELF IN FLORENCE
WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF ME
I HAD ONLY ONE CONFIDANT MY BROTHER MYCROFT
I OWE YOU MANY APOLOGIES
MY DEAR WATSON BUT IT WAS ALL IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD BE THOUGHT I
WAS DEAD AND IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN SO
CONVINCING AN ACCOUNT OF MY UNHAPPY END HAD YOU NOT YOURSELF THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS TRUE
SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS I HAVE TAKEN
UP MY PEN TO WRITE TO YOU BUT ALWAYS I FEARED LEST YOUR AFFECTIONATE
REGARD FOR ME SHOULD TEMPT YOU TO SOME INDISCRETION WHICH WOULD BETRAY
MY SECRET
FOR THAT REASON I TURNED AWAY FROM YOU THIS EVENING WHEN
YOU UPSET MY BOOKS FOR I WAS IN DANGER AT THE TIME AND ANY SHOW OF
SURPRISE AND EMOTION UPON YOUR PART MIGHT HAVE DRAWN ATTENTION TO MY
IDENTITY AND LED TO THE MOST DEPLORABLE AND IRREPARABLE RESULTS
AS TO
MYCROFT I HAD TO CONFIDE IN HIM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE MONEY WHICH
I NEEDED
THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN LONDON DID NOT RUN SO WELL AS I HAD
HOPED FOR THE TRIAL OF THE MORIARTY GANG LEFT TWO OF ITS MOST DANGEROUS
MEMBERS MY OWN MOST VINDICTIVE ENEMIES AT LIBERTY
I TRAVELLED FOR
TWO YEARS IN TIBET THEREFORE AND AMUSED MYSELF BY VISITING LHASSA
AND SPENDING SOME DAYS WITH THE HEAD LAMA
YOU MAY HAVE READ OF THE
REMARKABLE EXPLORATIONS OF A NORWEGIAN NAMED SIGERSON BUT I AM SURE
THAT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU THAT YOU WERE RECEIVING NEWS OF YOUR
FRIEND
I THEN PASSED THROUGH PERSIA LOOKED IN AT MECCA AND PAID A
SHORT BUT INTERESTING VISIT TO THE KHALIFA AT KHARTOUM THE RESULTS OF
WHICH I HAVE COMMUNICATED TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE
RETURNING TO FRANCE I
SPENT SOME MONTHS IN A RESEARCH INTO THE COAL TAR DERIVATIVES WHICH I
CONDUCTED IN A LABORATORY AT MONTPELLIER IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
HAVING
CONCLUDED THIS TO MY SATISFACTION AND LEARNING THAT ONLY ONE OF MY
ENEMIES WAS NOW LEFT IN LONDON I WAS ABOUT TO RETURN WHEN MY MOVEMENTS
WERE HASTENED BY THE NEWS OF THIS VERY REMARKABLE PARK LANE MYSTERY
WHICH NOT ONLY APPEALED TO ME BY ITS OWN MERITS BUT WHICH SEEMED TO
OFFER SOME MOST PECULIAR PERSONAL OPPORTUNITIES
I CAME OVER AT ONCE TO
LONDON CALLED IN MY OWN PERSON AT BAKER STREET THREW MRS
HUDSON INTO
VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND FOUND THAT MYCROFT HAD PRESERVED MY ROOMS AND MY
PAPERS EXACTLY AS THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN
SO IT WAS MY DEAR WATSON THAT
AT TWO O'CLOCK TO DAY I FOUND MYSELF IN MY OLD ARMCHAIR IN MY OWN OLD
ROOM AND ONLY WISHING THAT I COULD HAVE SEEN MY OLD FRIEND WATSON IN
THE OTHER CHAIR WHICH HE HAS SO OFTEN ADORNED
SUCH WAS THE REMARKABLE NARRATIVE TO WHICH I LISTENED ON THAT APRIL
EVENING A NARRATIVE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN UTTERLY INCREDIBLE TO ME HAD
IT NOT BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE ACTUAL SIGHT OF THE TALL SPARE FIGURE AND
THE KEEN EAGER FACE WHICH I HAD NEVER THOUGHT TO SEE AGAIN
IN SOME
MANNER HE HAD LEARNED OF MY OWN SAD BEREAVEMENT AND HIS SYMPATHY WAS
SHOWN IN HIS MANNER RATHER THAN IN HIS WORDS
WORK IS THE BEST ANTIDOTE
TO SORROW MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE AND I HAVE A PIECE OF WORK FOR US
BOTH TO NIGHT WHICH IF WE CAN BRING IT TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION WILL
IN ITSELF JUSTIFY A MAN'S LIFE ON THIS PLANET IN VAIN I BEGGED HIM
TO TELL ME MORE
YOU WILL HEAR AND SEE ENOUGH BEFORE MORNING HE
ANSWERED
WE HAVE THREE YEARS OF THE PAST TO DISCUSS
LET THAT SUFFICE
UNTIL HALF PAST NINE WHEN WE START UPON THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE
EMPTY HOUSE
IT WAS INDEED LIKE OLD TIMES WHEN AT THAT HOUR I FOUND MYSELF SEATED
BESIDE HIM IN A HANSOM MY REVOLVER IN MY POCKET AND THE THRILL OF
ADVENTURE IN MY HEART
HOLMES WAS COLD AND STERN AND SILENT
AS THE
GLEAM OF THE STREET LAMPS FLASHED UPON HIS AUSTERE FEATURES I SAW THAT
HIS BROWS WERE DRAWN DOWN IN THOUGHT AND HIS THIN LIPS COMPRESSED
I
KNEW NOT WHAT WILD BEAST WE WERE ABOUT TO HUNT DOWN IN THE DARK JUNGLE
OF CRIMINAL LONDON BUT I WAS WELL ASSURED FROM THE BEARING OF THIS
MASTER HUNTSMAN THAT THE ADVENTURE WAS A MOST GRAVE ONE WHILE THE
SARDONIC SMILE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BROKE THROUGH HIS ASCETIC GLOOM BODED
LITTLE GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF OUR QUEST
I HAD IMAGINED THAT WE WERE BOUND FOR BAKER STREET BUT HOLMES STOPPED
THE CAB AT THE CORNER OF CAVENDISH SQUARE
I OBSERVED THAT AS HE STEPPED
OUT HE GAVE A MOST SEARCHING GLANCE TO RIGHT AND LEFT AND AT EVERY
SUBSEQUENT STREET CORNER HE TOOK THE UTMOST PAINS TO ASSURE THAT HE WAS
NOT FOLLOWED
OUR ROUTE WAS CERTAINLY A SINGULAR ONE
HOLMES'S KNOWLEDGE
OF THE BYWAYS OF LONDON WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND ON THIS OCCASION HE
PASSED RAPIDLY AND WITH AN ASSURED STEP THROUGH A NETWORK OF MEWS AND
STABLES THE VERY EXISTENCE OF WHICH I HAD NEVER KNOWN
WE EMERGED AT
LAST INTO A SMALL ROAD LINED WITH OLD GLOOMY HOUSES WHICH LED US INTO
MANCHESTER STREET AND SO TO BLANDFORD STREET
HERE HE TURNED SWIFTLY
DOWN A NARROW PASSAGE PASSED THROUGH A WOODEN GATE INTO A DESERTED
YARD AND THEN OPENED WITH A KEY THE BACK DOOR OF A HOUSE
WE ENTERED
TOGETHER AND HE CLOSED IT BEHIND US
THE PLACE WAS PITCH DARK BUT IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT IT WAS AN EMPTY
HOUSE
OUR FEET CREAKED AND CRACKLED OVER THE BARE PLANKING AND MY
OUTSTRETCHED HAND TOUCHED A WALL FROM WHICH THE PAPER WAS HANGING IN
RIBBONS
HOLMES'S COLD THIN FINGERS CLOSED ROUND MY WRIST AND LED ME
FORWARD DOWN A LONG HALL UNTIL I DIMLY SAW THE MURKY FANLIGHT OVER THE
DOOR
HERE HOLMES TURNED SUDDENLY TO THE RIGHT AND WE FOUND OURSELVES
IN A LARGE SQUARE EMPTY ROOM HEAVILY SHADOWED IN THE CORNERS BUT
FAINTLY LIT IN THE CENTRE FROM THE LIGHTS OF THE STREET BEYOND
THERE
WAS NO LAMP NEAR AND THE WINDOW WAS THICK WITH DUST SO THAT WE COULD
ONLY JUST DISCERN EACH OTHER'S FIGURES WITHIN
MY COMPANION PUT HIS HAND
UPON MY SHOULDER AND HIS LIPS CLOSE TO MY EAR
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE HE WHISPERED
SURELY THAT IS BAKER STREET I ANSWERED STARING THROUGH THE DIM
WINDOW
EXACTLY
WE ARE IN CAMDEN HOUSE WHICH STANDS OPPOSITE TO OUR OWN OLD
QUARTERS
BUT WHY ARE WE HERE
BECAUSE IT COMMANDS SO EXCELLENT A VIEW OF THAT PICTURESQUE PILE
MIGHT
I TROUBLE YOU MY DEAR WATSON TO DRAW A LITTLE NEARER TO THE WINDOW
TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION NOT TO SHOW YOURSELF AND THEN TO LOOK UP AT OUR
OLD ROOMS THE STARTING POINT OF SO MANY OF YOUR LITTLE FAIRY TALES WE
WILL SEE IF MY THREE YEARS OF ABSENCE HAVE ENTIRELY TAKEN AWAY MY POWER
TO SURPRISE YOU
I CREPT FORWARD AND LOOKED ACROSS AT THE FAMILIAR WINDOW
AS MY EYES
FELL UPON IT I GAVE A GASP AND A CRY OF AMAZEMENT
THE BLIND WAS DOWN
AND A STRONG LIGHT WAS BURNING IN THE ROOM
THE SHADOW OF A MAN WHO
WAS SEATED IN A CHAIR WITHIN WAS THROWN IN HARD BLACK OUTLINE UPON THE
LUMINOUS SCREEN OF THE WINDOW
THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THE POISE OF THE
HEAD THE SQUARENESS OF THE SHOULDERS THE SHARPNESS OF THE FEATURES
THE FACE WAS TURNED HALF ROUND AND THE EFFECT WAS THAT OF ONE OF
THOSE BLACK SILHOUETTES WHICH OUR GRANDPARENTS LOVED TO FRAME
IT WAS A
PERFECT REPRODUCTION OF HOLMES
SO AMAZED WAS I THAT I THREW OUT MY
HAND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MAN HIMSELF WAS STANDING BESIDE ME
HE WAS
QUIVERING WITH SILENT LAUGHTER
WELL SAID HE
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED
IT IS MARVELLOUS
I TRUST THAT AGE DOTH NOT WITHER NOR CUSTOM STALE MY INFINITE VARIETY
SAID HE AND I RECOGNIZED IN HIS VOICE THE JOY AND PRIDE WHICH THE
ARTIST TAKES IN HIS OWN CREATION
IT REALLY IS RATHER LIKE ME IS IT
NOT
I SHOULD BE PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT IT WAS YOU
THE CREDIT OF THE EXECUTION IS DUE TO MONSIEUR OSCAR MEUNIER OF
GRENOBLE WHO SPENT SOME DAYS IN DOING THE MOULDING
IT IS A BUST IN
WAX
THE REST I ARRANGED MYSELF DURING MY VISIT TO BAKER STREET THIS
AFTERNOON
BUT WHY
BECAUSE MY DEAR WATSON I HAD THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE REASON FOR
WISHING CERTAIN PEOPLE TO THINK THAT I WAS THERE WHEN I WAS REALLY
ELSEWHERE
AND YOU THOUGHT THE ROOMS WERE WATCHED
I KNEW THAT THEY WERE WATCHED
BY WHOM
BY MY OLD ENEMIES WATSON
BY THE CHARMING SOCIETY WHOSE LEADER LIES
IN THE REICHENBACH FALL
YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY KNEW AND ONLY
THEY KNEW THAT I WAS STILL ALIVE
SOONER OR LATER THEY BELIEVED THAT I
SHOULD COME BACK TO MY ROOMS
THEY WATCHED THEM CONTINUOUSLY AND THIS
MORNING THEY SAW ME ARRIVE
HOW DO YOU KNOW
BECAUSE I RECOGNIZED THEIR SENTINEL WHEN I GLANCED OUT OF MY WINDOW
HE
IS A HARMLESS ENOUGH FELLOW PARKER BY NAME A GARROTER BY TRADE AND A
REMARKABLE PERFORMER UPON THE JEW'S HARP
I CARED NOTHING FOR HIM
BUT
I CARED A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE PERSON WHO WAS BEHIND
HIM THE BOSOM FRIEND OF MORIARTY THE MAN WHO DROPPED THE ROCKS OVER
THE CLIFF THE MOST CUNNING AND DANGEROUS CRIMINAL IN LONDON
THAT IS
THE MAN WHO IS AFTER ME TO NIGHT WATSON AND THAT IS THE MAN WHO IS
QUITE UNAWARE THAT WE ARE AFTER HIM
MY FRIEND'S PLANS WERE GRADUALLY REVEALING THEMSELVES
FROM THIS
CONVENIENT RETREAT THE WATCHERS WERE BEING WATCHED AND THE TRACKERS
TRACKED
THAT ANGULAR SHADOW UP YONDER WAS THE BAIT AND WE WERE THE
HUNTERS
IN SILENCE WE STOOD TOGETHER IN THE DARKNESS AND WATCHED THE
HURRYING FIGURES WHO PASSED AND REPASSED IN FRONT OF US
HOLMES WAS
SILENT AND MOTIONLESS BUT I COULD TELL THAT HE WAS KEENLY ALERT AND
THAT HIS EYES WERE FIXED INTENTLY UPON THE STREAM OF PASSERS BY
IT WAS
A BLEAK AND BOISTEROUS NIGHT AND THE WIND WHISTLED SHRILLY DOWN THE
LONG STREET
MANY PEOPLE WERE MOVING TO AND FRO MOST OF THEM MUFFLED IN
THEIR COATS AND CRAVATS
ONCE OR TWICE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD SEEN
THE SAME FIGURE BEFORE AND I ESPECIALLY NOTICED TWO MEN WHO APPEARED
TO BE SHELTERING THEMSELVES FROM THE WIND IN THE DOORWAY OF A HOUSE
SOME DISTANCE UP THE STREET
I TRIED TO DRAW MY COMPANION'S ATTENTION TO
THEM BUT HE GAVE A LITTLE EJACULATION OF IMPATIENCE AND CONTINUED
TO STARE INTO THE STREET
MORE THAN ONCE HE FIDGETED WITH HIS FEET AND
TAPPED RAPIDLY WITH HIS FINGERS UPON THE WALL
IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME
THAT HE WAS BECOMING UNEASY AND THAT HIS PLANS WERE NOT WORKING OUT
ALTOGETHER AS HE HAD HOPED
AT LAST AS MIDNIGHT APPROACHED AND
THE STREET GRADUALLY CLEARED HE PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN
UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION
I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME REMARK TO HIM WHEN
I RAISED MY EYES TO THE LIGHTED WINDOW AND AGAIN EXPERIENCED ALMOST AS
GREAT A SURPRISE AS BEFORE
I CLUTCHED HOLMES'S ARM AND POINTED UPWARD
THE SHADOW HAS MOVED I CRIED
IT WAS INDEED NO LONGER THE PROFILE BUT THE BACK WHICH WAS TURNED
TOWARDS US
THREE YEARS HAD CERTAINLY NOT SMOOTHED THE ASPERITIES OF HIS TEMPER OR
HIS IMPATIENCE WITH A LESS ACTIVE INTELLIGENCE THAN HIS OWN
OF COURSE IT HAS MOVED SAID HE
AM I SUCH A FARCICAL BUNGLER
WATSON THAT I SHOULD ERECT AN OBVIOUS DUMMY AND EXPECT THAT SOME OF
THE SHARPEST MEN IN EUROPE WOULD BE DECEIVED BY IT WE HAVE BEEN IN
THIS ROOM TWO HOURS AND MRS
HUDSON HAS MADE SOME CHANGE IN THAT FIGURE
EIGHT TIMES OR ONCE IN EVERY QUARTER OF AN HOUR
SHE WORKS IT FROM THE
FRONT SO THAT HER SHADOW MAY NEVER BE SEEN
AH HE DREW IN HIS BREATH
WITH A SHRILL EXCITED INTAKE
IN THE DIM LIGHT I SAW HIS HEAD THROWN
FORWARD HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE RIGID WITH ATTENTION
OUTSIDE THE STREET
WAS ABSOLUTELY DESERTED
THOSE TWO MEN MIGHT STILL BE CROUCHING IN THE
DOORWAY BUT I COULD NO LONGER SEE THEM
ALL WAS STILL AND DARK SAVE
ONLY THAT BRILLIANT YELLOW SCREEN IN FRONT OF US WITH THE BLACK FIGURE
OUTLINED UPON ITS CENTRE
AGAIN IN THE UTTER SILENCE I HEARD THAT THIN
SIBILANT NOTE WHICH SPOKE OF INTENSE SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT
AN INSTANT
LATER HE PULLED ME BACK INTO THE BLACKEST CORNER OF THE ROOM AND I
FELT HIS WARNING HAND UPON MY LIPS
THE FINGERS WHICH CLUTCHED ME WERE
QUIVERING
NEVER HAD I KNOWN MY FRIEND MORE MOVED AND YET THE DARK
STREET STILL STRETCHED LONELY AND MOTIONLESS BEFORE US
BUT SUDDENLY I WAS AWARE OF THAT WHICH HIS KEENER SENSES HAD ALREADY
DISTINGUISHED
A LOW STEALTHY SOUND CAME TO MY EARS NOT FROM THE
DIRECTION OF BAKER STREET BUT FROM THE BACK OF THE VERY HOUSE IN WHICH
WE LAY CONCEALED
A DOOR OPENED AND SHUT
AN INSTANT LATER STEPS
CREPT DOWN THE PASSAGE STEPS WHICH WERE MEANT TO BE SILENT BUT WHICH
REVERBERATED HARSHLY THROUGH THE EMPTY HOUSE
HOLMES CROUCHED BACK
AGAINST THE WALL AND I DID THE SAME MY HAND CLOSING UPON THE HANDLE
OF MY REVOLVER
PEERING THROUGH THE GLOOM I SAW THE VAGUE OUTLINE OF A
MAN A SHADE BLACKER THAN THE BLACKNESS OF THE OPEN DOOR
HE STOOD FOR
AN INSTANT AND THEN HE CREPT FORWARD CROUCHING MENACING INTO THE
ROOM
HE WAS WITHIN THREE YARDS OF US THIS SINISTER FIGURE AND I HAD
BRACED MYSELF TO MEET HIS SPRING BEFORE I REALIZED THAT HE HAD NO IDEA
OF OUR PRESENCE
HE PASSED CLOSE BESIDE US STOLE OVER TO THE WINDOW
AND VERY SOFTLY AND NOISELESSLY RAISED IT FOR HALF A FOOT
AS HE SANK TO
THE LEVEL OF THIS OPENING THE LIGHT OF THE STREET NO LONGER DIMMED BY
THE DUSTY GLASS FELL FULL UPON HIS FACE
THE MAN SEEMED TO BE BESIDE
HIMSELF WITH EXCITEMENT
HIS TWO EYES SHONE LIKE STARS AND HIS
FEATURES WERE WORKING CONVULSIVELY
HE WAS AN ELDERLY MAN WITH A THIN
PROJECTING NOSE A HIGH BALD FOREHEAD AND A HUGE GRIZZLED MOUSTACHE
AN OPERA HAT WAS PUSHED TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND AN EVENING DRESS
SHIRT FRONT GLEAMED OUT THROUGH HIS OPEN OVERCOAT
HIS FACE WAS GAUNT
AND SWARTHY SCORED WITH DEEP SAVAGE LINES
IN HIS HAND HE CARRIED WHAT
APPEARED TO BE A STICK BUT AS HE LAID IT DOWN UPON THE FLOOR IT GAVE
A METALLIC CLANG
THEN FROM THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT HE DREW A BULKY
OBJECT AND HE BUSIED HIMSELF IN SOME TASK WHICH ENDED WITH A LOUD
SHARP CLICK AS IF A SPRING OR BOLT HAD FALLEN INTO ITS PLACE
STILL
KNEELING UPON THE FLOOR HE BENT FORWARD AND THREW ALL HIS WEIGHT AND
STRENGTH UPON SOME LEVER WITH THE RESULT THAT THERE CAME A LONG
WHIRLING GRINDING NOISE ENDING ONCE MORE IN A POWERFUL CLICK
HE
STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF THEN AND I SAW THAT WHAT HE HELD IN HIS HAND WAS
A SORT OF GUN WITH A CURIOUSLY MISSHAPEN BUTT
HE OPENED IT AT THE
BREECH PUT SOMETHING IN AND SNAPPED THE BREECH LOCK
THEN CROUCHING
DOWN HE RESTED THE END OF THE BARREL UPON THE LEDGE OF THE OPEN WINDOW
AND I SAW HIS LONG MOUSTACHE DROOP OVER THE STOCK AND HIS EYE GLEAM AS
IT PEERED ALONG THE SIGHTS
I HEARD A LITTLE SIGH OF SATISFACTION AS
HE CUDDLED THE BUTT INTO HIS SHOULDER AND SAW THAT AMAZING TARGET
THE BLACK MAN ON THE YELLOW GROUND STANDING CLEAR AT THE END OF HIS
FORESIGHT
FOR AN INSTANT HE WAS RIGID AND MOTIONLESS
THEN HIS FINGER
TIGHTENED ON THE TRIGGER
THERE WAS A STRANGE LOUD WHIZ AND A LONG
SILVERY TINKLE OF BROKEN GLASS
AT THAT INSTANT HOLMES SPRANG LIKE A
TIGER ON TO THE MARKSMAN'S BACK AND HURLED HIM FLAT UPON HIS FACE
HE
WAS UP AGAIN IN A MOMENT AND WITH CONVULSIVE STRENGTH HE SEIZED
HOLMES BY THE THROAT BUT I STRUCK HIM ON THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF MY
REVOLVER AND HE DROPPED AGAIN UPON THE FLOOR
I FELL UPON HIM AND AS
I HELD HIM MY COMRADE BLEW A SHRILL CALL UPON A WHISTLE
THERE WAS THE
CLATTER OF RUNNING FEET UPON THE PAVEMENT AND TWO POLICEMEN IN UNIFORM
WITH ONE PLAIN CLOTHES DETECTIVE RUSHED THROUGH THE FRONT ENTRANCE AND
INTO THE ROOM
THAT YOU LESTRADE SAID HOLMES
YES MR
HOLMES
I TOOK THE JOB MYSELF
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK IN
LONDON SIR
I THINK YOU WANT A LITTLE UNOFFICIAL HELP
THREE UNDETECTED MURDERS IN
ONE YEAR WON'T DO LESTRADE
BUT YOU HANDLED THE MOLESEY MYSTERY WITH
LESS THAN YOUR USUAL THAT'S TO SAY YOU HANDLED IT FAIRLY WELL
WE HAD ALL RISEN TO OUR FEET OUR PRISONER BREATHING HARD WITH A
STALWART CONSTABLE ON EACH SIDE OF HIM
ALREADY A FEW LOITERERS HAD
BEGUN TO COLLECT IN THE STREET
HOLMES STEPPED UP TO THE WINDOW CLOSED
IT AND DROPPED THE BLINDS
LESTRADE HAD PRODUCED TWO CANDLES AND THE
POLICEMEN HAD UNCOVERED THEIR LANTERNS
I WAS ABLE AT LAST TO HAVE A
GOOD LOOK AT OUR PRISONER
IT WAS A TREMENDOUSLY VIRILE AND YET SINISTER FACE WHICH WAS TURNED
TOWARDS US
WITH THE BROW OF A PHILOSOPHER ABOVE AND THE JAW OF A
SENSUALIST BELOW THE MAN MUST HAVE STARTED WITH GREAT CAPACITIES FOR
GOOD OR FOR EVIL
BUT ONE COULD NOT LOOK UPON HIS CRUEL BLUE EYES WITH
THEIR DROOPING CYNICAL LIDS OR UPON THE FIERCE AGGRESSIVE NOSE AND
THE THREATENING DEEP LINED BROW WITHOUT READING NATURE'S PLAINEST
DANGER SIGNALS
HE TOOK NO HEED OF ANY OF US BUT HIS EYES WERE FIXED
UPON HOLMES'S FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION IN WHICH HATRED AND AMAZEMENT WERE
EQUALLY BLENDED
YOU FIEND HE KEPT ON MUTTERING
YOU CLEVER CLEVER
FIEND
AH COLONEL SAID HOLMES ARRANGING HIS RUMPLED COLLAR
'JOURNEYS END
IN LOVERS' MEETINGS AS THE OLD PLAY SAYS
I DON'T THINK I HAVE HAD THE
PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU SINCE YOU FAVOURED ME WITH THOSE ATTENTIONS AS I
LAY ON THE LEDGE ABOVE THE REICHENBACH FALL
THE COLONEL STILL STARED AT MY FRIEND LIKE A MAN IN A TRANCE
YOU
CUNNING CUNNING FIEND WAS ALL THAT HE COULD SAY
I HAVE NOT INTRODUCED YOU YET SAID HOLMES
THIS GENTLEMEN IS
COLONEL SEBASTIAN MORAN ONCE OF HER MAJESTY'S INDIAN ARMY AND THE BEST
HEAVY GAME SHOT THAT OUR EASTERN EMPIRE HAS EVER PRODUCED
I BELIEVE
I AM CORRECT COLONEL IN SAYING THAT YOUR BAG OF TIGERS STILL REMAINS
UNRIVALLED
THE FIERCE OLD MAN SAID NOTHING BUT STILL GLARED AT MY COMPANION
WITH
HIS SAVAGE EYES AND BRISTLING MOUSTACHE HE WAS WONDERFULLY LIKE A TIGER
HIMSELF
I WONDER THAT MY VERY SIMPLE STRATAGEM COULD DECEIVE SO OLD A SHIKARI
SAID HOLMES
IT MUST BE VERY FAMILIAR TO YOU
HAVE YOU NOT TETHERED A
YOUNG KID UNDER A TREE LAIN ABOVE IT WITH YOUR RIFLE AND WAITED FOR
THE BAIT TO BRING UP YOUR TIGER THIS EMPTY HOUSE IS MY TREE AND YOU
ARE MY TIGER
YOU HAVE POSSIBLY HAD OTHER GUNS IN RESERVE IN CASE THERE
SHOULD BE SEVERAL TIGERS OR IN THE UNLIKELY SUPPOSITION OF YOUR OWN AIM
FAILING YOU
THESE HE POINTED AROUND ARE MY OTHER GUNS
THE PARALLEL
IS EXACT
COLONEL MORAN SPRANG FORWARD WITH A SNARL OF RAGE BUT THE CONSTABLES
DRAGGED HIM BACK
THE FURY UPON HIS FACE WAS TERRIBLE TO LOOK AT
I CONFESS THAT YOU HAD ONE SMALL SURPRISE FOR ME SAID HOLMES
I DID
NOT ANTICIPATE THAT YOU WOULD YOURSELF MAKE USE OF THIS EMPTY HOUSE AND
THIS CONVENIENT FRONT WINDOW
I HAD IMAGINED YOU AS OPERATING FROM THE
STREET WHERE MY FRIEND LESTRADE AND HIS MERRY MEN WERE AWAITING YOU
WITH THAT EXCEPTION ALL HAS GONE AS I EXPECTED
COLONEL MORAN TURNED TO THE OFFICIAL DETECTIVE
YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE JUST CAUSE FOR ARRESTING ME SAID HE BUT AT
LEAST THERE CAN BE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD SUBMIT TO THE GIBES OF THIS
PERSON
IF I AM IN THE HANDS OF THE LAW LET THINGS BE DONE IN A LEGAL
WAY
WELL THAT'S REASONABLE ENOUGH SAID LESTRADE
NOTHING FURTHER YOU
HAVE TO SAY MR
HOLMES BEFORE WE GO
HOLMES HAD PICKED UP THE POWERFUL AIR GUN FROM THE FLOOR AND WAS
EXAMINING ITS MECHANISM
AN ADMIRABLE AND UNIQUE WEAPON SAID HE NOISELESS AND OF TREMENDOUS
POWER I KNEW VON HERDER THE BLIND GERMAN MECHANIC WHO CONSTRUCTED IT
TO THE ORDER OF THE LATE PROFESSOR MORIARTY
FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN
AWARE OF ITS EXISTENCE THOUGH I HAVE NEVER BEFORE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF
HANDLING IT
I COMMEND IT VERY SPECIALLY TO YOUR ATTENTION LESTRADE AND
ALSO THE BULLETS WHICH FIT IT
YOU CAN TRUST US TO LOOK AFTER THAT MR
HOLMES SAID LESTRADE AS THE
WHOLE PARTY MOVED TOWARDS THE DOOR
ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY
ONLY TO ASK WHAT CHARGE YOU INTEND TO PREFER
WHAT CHARGE SIR WHY OF COURSE THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF MR
SHERLOCK
HOLMES
NOT SO LESTRADE
I DO NOT PROPOSE TO APPEAR IN THE MATTER AT ALL
TO
YOU AND TO YOU ONLY BELONGS THE CREDIT OF THE REMARKABLE ARREST WHICH
YOU HAVE EFFECTED
YES LESTRADE I CONGRATULATE YOU WITH YOUR USUAL
HAPPY MIXTURE OF CUNNING AND AUDACITY YOU HAVE GOT HIM
GOT HIM GOT WHOM MR
HOLMES
THE MAN THAT THE WHOLE FORCE HAS BEEN SEEKING IN VAIN COLONEL
SEBASTIAN MORAN WHO SHOT THE HONOURABLE RONALD ADAIR WITH AN EXPANDING
BULLET FROM AN AIR GUN THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW OF THE SECOND FLOOR
FRONT OF NO
427 PARK LANE UPON THE THIRTIETH OF LAST MONTH
THAT'S THE
CHARGE LESTRADE
AND NOW WATSON IF YOU CAN ENDURE THE DRAUGHT FROM
A BROKEN WINDOW I THINK THAT HALF AN HOUR IN MY STUDY OVER A CIGAR MAY
AFFORD YOU SOME PROFITABLE AMUSEMENT
OUR OLD CHAMBERS HAD BEEN LEFT UNCHANGED THROUGH THE SUPERVISION OF
MYCROFT HOLMES AND THE IMMEDIATE CARE OF MRS
HUDSON
AS I ENTERED I
SAW IT IS TRUE AN UNWONTED TIDINESS BUT THE OLD LANDMARKS WERE ALL
IN THEIR PLACE
THERE WERE THE CHEMICAL CORNER AND THE ACID STAINED
DEAL TOPPED TABLE
THERE UPON A SHELF WAS THE ROW OF FORMIDABLE
SCRAP BOOKS AND BOOKS OF REFERENCE WHICH MANY OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS
WOULD HAVE BEEN SO GLAD TO BURN
THE DIAGRAMS THE VIOLIN CASE AND THE
PIPE RACK EVEN THE PERSIAN SLIPPER WHICH CONTAINED THE TOBACCO ALL
MET MY EYES AS I GLANCED ROUND ME
THERE WERE TWO OCCUPANTS OF THE
ROOM ONE MRS
HUDSON WHO BEAMED UPON US BOTH AS WE ENTERED THE
OTHER THE STRANGE DUMMY WHICH HAD PLAYED SO IMPORTANT A PART IN THE
EVENING'S ADVENTURES
IT WAS A WAX COLOURED MODEL OF MY FRIEND SO
ADMIRABLY DONE THAT IT WAS A PERFECT FACSIMILE
IT STOOD ON A SMALL
PEDESTAL TABLE WITH AN OLD DRESSING GOWN OF HOLMES'S SO DRAPED ROUND IT
THAT THE ILLUSION FROM THE STREET WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT
I HOPE YOU OBSERVED ALL PRECAUTIONS MRS
HUDSON SAID HOLMES
I WENT TO IT ON MY KNEES SIR JUST AS YOU TOLD ME
EXCELLENT
YOU CARRIED THE THING OUT VERY WELL
DID YOU OBSERVE WHERE
THE BULLET WENT
YES SIR
I'M AFRAID IT HAS SPOILT YOUR BEAUTIFUL BUST FOR IT PASSED
RIGHT THROUGH THE HEAD AND FLATTENED ITSELF ON THE WALL
I PICKED IT UP
FROM THE CARPET
HERE IT IS
HOLMES HELD IT OUT TO ME
A SOFT REVOLVER BULLET AS YOU PERCEIVE
WATSON
THERE'S GENIUS IN THAT FOR WHO WOULD EXPECT TO FIND SUCH A
THING FIRED FROM AN AIRGUN ALL RIGHT MRS
HUDSON
I AM MUCH OBLIGED
FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE
AND NOW WATSON LET ME SEE YOU IN YOUR OLD SEAT
ONCE MORE FOR THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
WITH YOU
HE HAD THROWN OFF THE SEEDY FROCKCOAT AND NOW HE WAS THE HOLMES OF OLD
IN THE MOUSE COLOURED DRESSING GOWN WHICH HE TOOK FROM HIS EFFIGY
THE OLD SHIKARI'S NERVES HAVE NOT LOST THEIR STEADINESS NOR HIS EYES
THEIR KEENNESS SAID HE WITH A LAUGH AS HE INSPECTED THE SHATTERED
FOREHEAD OF HIS BUST
PLUMB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK OF THE HEAD AND SMACK THROUGH THE
BRAIN
HE WAS THE BEST SHOT IN INDIA AND I EXPECT THAT THERE ARE FEW
BETTER IN LONDON
HAVE YOU HEARD THE NAME
NO I HAVE NOT
WELL WELL SUCH IS FAME BUT THEN IF I REMEMBER RIGHT YOU HAD NOT
HEARD THE NAME OF PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY WHO HAD ONE OF THE GREAT
BRAINS OF THE CENTURY
JUST GIVE ME DOWN MY INDEX OF BIOGRAPHIES FROM
THE SHELF
HE TURNED OVER THE PAGES LAZILY LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND BLOWING
GREAT CLOUDS FROM HIS CIGAR
MY COLLECTION OF M'S IS A FINE ONE SAID HE
MORIARTY HIMSELF IS
ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY LETTER ILLUSTRIOUS AND HERE IS MORGAN THE POISONER
AND MERRIDEW OF ABOMINABLE MEMORY AND MATHEWS WHO KNOCKED OUT MY LEFT
CANINE IN THE WAITING ROOM AT CHARING CROSS AND FINALLY HERE IS OUR
FRIEND OF TO NIGHT
HE HANDED OVER THE BOOK AND I READ
MORAN SEBASTIAN COLONEL
UNEMPLOYED
FORMERLY 1ST BANGALORE PIONEERS
BORN LONDON 1840
SON OF SIR AUGUSTUS MORAN C
B ONCE BRITISH
MINISTER TO PERSIA
EDUCATED ETON AND OXFORD
SERVED IN JOWAKI CAMPAIGN
AFGHAN CAMPAIGN CHARASIAB DESPATCHES SHERPUR AND CABUL
AUTHOR OF
HEAVY GAME OF THE WESTERN HIMALAYAS 1881 THREE MONTHS IN THE
JUNGLE 1884
ADDRESS CONDUIT STREET
CLUBS THE ANGLO INDIAN THE
TANKERVILLE THE BAGATELLE CARD CLUB
ON THE MARGIN WAS WRITTEN IN HOLMES'S PRECISE HAND
THE SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN LONDON
THIS IS ASTONISHING SAID I AS I HANDED BACK THE VOLUME
THE MAN'S
CAREER IS THAT OF AN HONOURABLE SOLDIER
IT IS TRUE HOLMES ANSWERED
UP TO A CERTAIN POINT HE DID WELL
HE
WAS ALWAYS A MAN OF IRON NERVE AND THE STORY IS STILL TOLD IN INDIA HOW
HE CRAWLED DOWN A DRAIN AFTER A WOUNDED MAN EATING TIGER
THERE ARE SOME
TREES WATSON WHICH GROW TO A CERTAIN HEIGHT AND THEN SUDDENLY DEVELOP
SOME UNSIGHTLY ECCENTRICITY
YOU WILL SEE IT OFTEN IN HUMANS
I HAVE
A THEORY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS IN HIS DEVELOPMENT THE WHOLE
PROCESSION OF HIS ANCESTORS AND THAT SUCH A SUDDEN TURN TO GOOD OR
EVIL STANDS FOR SOME STRONG INFLUENCE WHICH CAME INTO THE LINE OF HIS
PEDIGREE
THE PERSON BECOMES AS IT WERE THE EPITOME OF THE HISTORY OF
HIS OWN FAMILY
IT IS SURELY RATHER FANCIFUL
WELL I DON'T INSIST UPON IT
WHATEVER THE CAUSE COLONEL MORAN BEGAN
TO GO WRONG
WITHOUT ANY OPEN SCANDAL HE STILL MADE INDIA TOO
HOT TO HOLD HIM
HE RETIRED CAME TO LONDON AND AGAIN ACQUIRED AN EVIL
NAME
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT HE WAS SOUGHT OUT BY PROFESSOR MORIARTY
TO WHOM FOR A TIME HE WAS CHIEF OF THE STAFF
MORIARTY SUPPLIED HIM
LIBERALLY WITH MONEY AND USED HIM ONLY IN ONE OR TWO VERY HIGH CLASS
JOBS WHICH NO ORDINARY CRIMINAL COULD HAVE UNDERTAKEN
YOU MAY HAVE
SOME RECOLLECTION OF THE DEATH OF MRS
STEWART OF LAUDER IN 1887
NOT WELL I AM SURE MORAN WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT NOTHING COULD
BE PROVED
SO CLEVERLY WAS THE COLONEL CONCEALED THAT EVEN WHEN THE
MORIARTY GANG WAS BROKEN UP WE COULD NOT INCRIMINATE HIM
YOU REMEMBER
AT THAT DATE WHEN I CALLED UPON YOU IN YOUR ROOMS HOW I PUT UP THE
SHUTTERS FOR FEAR OF AIR GUNS NO DOUBT YOU THOUGHT ME FANCIFUL
I KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING FOR I KNEW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS REMARKABLE
GUN AND I KNEW ALSO THAT ONE OF THE BEST SHOTS IN THE WORLD WOULD BE
BEHIND IT
WHEN WE WERE IN SWITZERLAND HE FOLLOWED US WITH MORIARTY
AND IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY HE WHO GAVE ME THAT EVIL FIVE MINUTES ON THE
REICHENBACH LEDGE
YOU MAY THINK THAT I READ THE PAPERS WITH SOME ATTENTION DURING MY
SOJOURN IN FRANCE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR ANY CHANCE OF LAYING HIM BY THE
HEELS
SO LONG AS HE WAS FREE IN LONDON MY LIFE WOULD REALLY NOT HAVE
BEEN WORTH LIVING
NIGHT AND DAY THE SHADOW WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER ME AND
SOONER OR LATER HIS CHANCE MUST HAVE COME
WHAT COULD I DO I COULD NOT
SHOOT HIM AT SIGHT OR I SHOULD MYSELF BE IN THE DOCK
THERE WAS NO USE
APPEALING TO A MAGISTRATE
THEY CANNOT INTERFERE ON THE STRENGTH OF WHAT
WOULD APPEAR TO THEM TO BE A WILD SUSPICION
SO I COULD DO NOTHING
BUT
I WATCHED THE CRIMINAL NEWS KNOWING THAT SOONER OR LATER I SHOULD GET
HIM
THEN CAME THE DEATH OF THIS RONALD ADAIR
MY CHANCE HAD COME AT
LAST
KNOWING WHAT I DID WAS IT NOT CERTAIN THAT COLONEL MORAN HAD DONE
IT HE HAD PLAYED CARDS WITH THE LAD HE HAD FOLLOWED HIM HOME FROM THE
CLUB HE HAD SHOT HIM THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW
THERE WAS NOT A DOUBT OF
IT
THE BULLETS ALONE ARE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HEAD IN A NOOSE
I CAME
OVER AT ONCE
I WAS SEEN BY THE SENTINEL WHO WOULD I KNEW DIRECT
THE COLONEL'S ATTENTION TO MY PRESENCE
HE COULD NOT FAIL TO CONNECT
MY SUDDEN RETURN WITH HIS CRIME AND TO BE TERRIBLY ALARMED
I WAS SURE
THAT HE WOULD MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO GET ME OUT OF THE WAY AT ONCE AND
WOULD BRING ROUND HIS MURDEROUS WEAPON FOR THAT PURPOSE
I LEFT HIM AN
EXCELLENT MARK IN THE WINDOW AND HAVING WARNED THE POLICE THAT THEY
MIGHT BE NEEDED BY THE WAY WATSON YOU SPOTTED THEIR PRESENCE IN THAT
DOORWAY WITH UNERRING ACCURACY I TOOK UP WHAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE A
JUDICIOUS POST FOR OBSERVATION NEVER DREAMING THAT HE WOULD CHOOSE THE
SAME SPOT FOR HIS ATTACK
NOW MY DEAR WATSON DOES ANYTHING REMAIN FOR
ME TO EXPLAIN
YES SAID I
YOU HAVE NOT MADE IT CLEAR WHAT WAS COLONEL MORAN'S
MOTIVE IN MURDERING THE HONOURABLE RONALD ADAIR
AH MY DEAR WATSON THERE WE COME INTO THOSE REALMS OF CONJECTURE
WHERE THE MOST LOGICAL MIND MAY BE AT FAULT
EACH MAY FORM HIS OWN
HYPOTHESIS UPON THE PRESENT EVIDENCE AND YOURS IS AS LIKELY TO BE
CORRECT AS MINE
YOU HAVE FORMED ONE THEN
I THINK THAT IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THE FACTS
IT CAME OUT IN
EVIDENCE THAT COLONEL MORAN AND YOUNG ADAIR HAD BETWEEN THEM WON A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY
NOW MORAN UNDOUBTEDLY PLAYED FOUL OF THAT
I HAVE LONG BEEN AWARE
I BELIEVE THAT ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER ADAIR HAD
DISCOVERED THAT MORAN WAS CHEATING
VERY LIKELY HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
PRIVATELY AND HAD THREATENED TO EXPOSE HIM UNLESS HE VOLUNTARILY
RESIGNED HIS MEMBERSHIP OF THE CLUB AND PROMISED NOT TO PLAY CARDS
AGAIN
IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A YOUNGSTER LIKE ADAIR WOULD AT ONCE MAKE A
HIDEOUS SCANDAL BY EXPOSING A WELL KNOWN MAN SO MUCH OLDER THAN HIMSELF
PROBABLY HE ACTED AS I SUGGEST
THE EXCLUSION FROM HIS CLUBS WOULD MEAN
RUIN TO MORAN WHO LIVED BY HIS ILL GOTTEN CARD GAINS
HE THEREFORE
MURDERED ADAIR WHO AT THE TIME WAS ENDEAVOURING TO WORK OUT HOW
MUCH MONEY HE SHOULD HIMSELF RETURN SINCE HE COULD NOT PROFIT BY HIS
PARTNER'S FOUL PLAY
HE LOCKED THE DOOR LEST THE LADIES SHOULD SURPRISE
HIM AND INSIST UPON KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH THESE NAMES AND
COINS
WILL IT PASS
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE HIT UPON THE TRUTH
IT WILL BE VERIFIED OR DISPROVED AT THE TRIAL
MEANWHILE COME WHAT
MAY COLONEL MORAN WILL TROUBLE US NO MORE
THE FAMOUS AIR GUN OF VON
HERDER WILL EMBELLISH THE SCOTLAND YARD MUSEUM AND ONCE AGAIN
MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES IS FREE TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO EXAMINING THOSE
INTERESTING LITTLE PROBLEMS WHICH THE COMPLEX LIFE OF LONDON SO
PLENTIFULLY PRESENTS
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE CRIMINAL EXPERT SAID MR
SHERLOCK
HOLMES LONDON HAS BECOME A SINGULARLY UNINTERESTING CITY SINCE THE
DEATH OF THE LATE LAMENTED PROFESSOR MORIARTY
I CAN HARDLY THINK THAT YOU WOULD FIND MANY DECENT CITIZENS TO AGREE
WITH YOU I ANSWERED
WELL WELL I MUST NOT BE SELFISH SAID HE WITH A SMILE AS HE PUSHED
BACK HIS CHAIR FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE
THE COMMUNITY IS CERTAINLY
THE GAINER AND NO ONE THE LOSER SAVE THE POOR OUT OF WORK SPECIALIST
WHOSE OCCUPATION HAS GONE
WITH THAT MAN IN THE FIELD ONE'S MORNING
PAPER PRESENTED INFINITE POSSIBILITIES
OFTEN IT WAS ONLY THE SMALLEST
TRACE WATSON THE FAINTEST INDICATION AND YET IT WAS ENOUGH TO TELL ME
THAT THE GREAT MALIGNANT BRAIN WAS THERE AS THE GENTLEST TREMORS OF
THE EDGES OF THE WEB REMIND ONE OF THE FOUL SPIDER WHICH LURKS IN THE
CENTRE
PETTY THEFTS WANTON ASSAULTS PURPOSELESS OUTRAGE TO THE MAN
WHO HELD THE CLUE ALL COULD BE WORKED INTO ONE CONNECTED WHOLE
TO THE
SCIENTIFIC STUDENT OF THE HIGHER CRIMINAL WORLD NO CAPITAL IN EUROPE
OFFERED THE ADVANTAGES WHICH LONDON THEN POSSESSED
BUT NOW HE
SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN HUMOROUS DEPRECATION OF THE STATE OF THINGS
WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF DONE SO MUCH TO PRODUCE
AT THE TIME OF WHICH I SPEAK HOLMES HAD BEEN BACK FOR SOME MONTHS
AND I AT HIS REQUEST HAD SOLD MY PRACTICE AND RETURNED TO SHARE THE OLD
QUARTERS IN BAKER STREET
A YOUNG DOCTOR NAMED VERNER HAD PURCHASED MY
SMALL KENSINGTON PRACTICE AND GIVEN WITH ASTONISHINGLY LITTLE DEMUR THE
HIGHEST PRICE THAT I VENTURED TO ASK AN INCIDENT WHICH ONLY EXPLAINED
ITSELF SOME YEARS LATER WHEN I FOUND THAT VERNER WAS A DISTANT RELATION
OF HOLMES AND THAT IT WAS MY FRIEND WHO HAD REALLY FOUND THE MONEY
OUR MONTHS OF PARTNERSHIP HAD NOT BEEN SO UNEVENTFUL AS HE HAD STATED
FOR I FIND ON LOOKING OVER MY NOTES THAT THIS PERIOD INCLUDES THE CASE
OF THE PAPERS OF EX PRESIDENT MURILLO AND ALSO THE SHOCKING AFFAIR OF
THE DUTCH STEAMSHIP FRIESLAND WHICH SO NEARLY COST US BOTH OUR LIVES
HIS COLD AND PROUD NATURE WAS ALWAYS AVERSE HOWEVER FROM ANYTHING
IN THE SHAPE OF PUBLIC APPLAUSE AND HE BOUND ME IN THE MOST
STRINGENT TERMS TO SAY NO FURTHER WORD OF HIMSELF HIS METHODS OR HIS
SUCCESSES A PROHIBITION WHICH AS I HAVE EXPLAINED HAS ONLY NOW BEEN
REMOVED
MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AFTER HIS WHIMSICAL
PROTEST AND WAS UNFOLDING HIS MORNING PAPER IN A LEISURELY FASHION
WHEN OUR ATTENTION WAS ARRESTED BY A TREMENDOUS RING AT THE BELL
FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A HOLLOW DRUMMING SOUND AS IF SOMEONE WERE
BEATING ON THE OUTER DOOR WITH HIS FIST
AS IT OPENED THERE CAME A
TUMULTUOUS RUSH INTO THE HALL RAPID FEET CLATTERED UP THE STAIR AND AN
INSTANT LATER A WILD EYED AND FRANTIC YOUNG MAN PALE DISHEVELED AND
PALPITATING BURST INTO THE ROOM
HE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US
AND UNDER OUR GAZE OF INQUIRY HE BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT SOME APOLOGY WAS
NEEDED FOR THIS UNCEREMONIOUS ENTRY
I'M SORRY MR
HOLMES HE CRIED
YOU MUSTN'T BLAME ME
I AM NEARLY
MAD
MR
HOLMES I AM THE UNHAPPY JOHN HECTOR MCFARLANE
HE MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT AS IF THE NAME ALONE WOULD EXPLAIN BOTH HIS
VISIT AND ITS MANNER BUT I COULD SEE BY MY COMPANION'S UNRESPONSIVE
FACE THAT IT MEANT NO MORE TO HIM THAN TO ME
HAVE A CIGARETTE MR
MCFARLANE SAID HE PUSHING HIS CASE ACROSS
I AM SURE THAT WITH YOUR SYMPTOMS MY FRIEND DR
WATSON HERE WOULD
PRESCRIBE A SEDATIVE
THE WEATHER HAS BEEN SO VERY WARM THESE LAST FEW
DAYS
NOW IF YOU FEEL A LITTLE MORE COMPOSED I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU
WOULD SIT DOWN IN THAT CHAIR AND TELL US VERY SLOWLY AND QUIETLY WHO
YOU ARE AND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT
YOU MENTIONED YOUR NAME AS IF
I SHOULD RECOGNIZE IT BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT BEYOND THE OBVIOUS FACTS
THAT YOU ARE A BACHELOR A SOLICITOR A FREEMASON AND AN ASTHMATIC I
KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT YOU
FAMILIAR AS I WAS WITH MY FRIEND'S METHODS IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO FOLLOW HIS DEDUCTIONS AND TO OBSERVE THE UNTIDINESS OF ATTIRE THE
SHEAF OF LEGAL PAPERS THE WATCH CHARM AND THE BREATHING WHICH HAD
PROMPTED THEM
OUR CLIENT HOWEVER STARED IN AMAZEMENT
YES I AM ALL THAT MR
HOLMES AND IN ADDITION I AM THE MOST
UNFORTUNATE MAN AT THIS MOMENT IN LONDON
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DON'T
ABANDON ME MR
HOLMES IF THEY COME TO ARREST ME BEFORE I HAVE FINISHED
MY STORY MAKE THEM GIVE ME TIME SO THAT I MAY TELL YOU THE WHOLE
TRUTH
I COULD GO TO JAIL HAPPY IF I KNEW THAT YOU WERE WORKING FOR ME
OUTSIDE
ARREST YOU SAID HOLMES
THIS IS REALLY MOST GRATI MOST INTERESTING
ON WHAT CHARGE DO YOU EXPECT TO BE ARRESTED
UPON THE CHARGE OF MURDERING MR
JONAS OLDACRE OF LOWER NORWOOD
MY COMPANION'S EXPRESSIVE FACE SHOWED A SYMPATHY WHICH WAS NOT I AM
AFRAID ENTIRELY UNMIXED WITH SATISFACTION
DEAR ME SAID HE IT WAS ONLY THIS MOMENT AT BREAKFAST THAT I WAS
SAYING TO MY FRIEND DR
WATSON THAT SENSATIONAL CASES HAD DISAPPEARED
OUT OF OUR PAPERS
OUR VISITOR STRETCHED FORWARD A QUIVERING HAND AND PICKED UP THE DAILY
TELEGRAPH WHICH STILL LAY UPON HOLMES'S KNEE
IF YOU HAD LOOKED AT IT SIR YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN AT A GLANCE WHAT THE
ERRAND IS ON WHICH I HAVE COME TO YOU THIS MORNING
I FEEL AS IF MY NAME
AND MY MISFORTUNE MUST BE IN EVERY MAN'S MOUTH HE TURNED IT OVER TO
EXPOSE THE CENTRAL PAGE
HERE IT IS AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION I
WILL READ IT TO YOU
LISTEN TO THIS MR
HOLMES
THE HEADLINES ARE
'MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT LOWER NORWOOD
DISAPPEARANCE OF A WELL KNOWN
BUILDER
SUSPICION OF MURDER AND ARSON
A CLUE TO THE CRIMINAL THAT IS
THE CLUE WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY FOLLOWING MR
HOLMES AND I KNOW THAT
IT LEADS INFALLIBLY TO ME
I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED FROM LONDON BRIDGE
STATION AND I AM SURE THAT THEY ARE ONLY WAITING FOR THE WARRANT TO
ARREST ME
IT WILL BREAK MY MOTHER'S HEART IT WILL BREAK HER HEART
HE WRUNG HIS HANDS IN AN AGONY OF APPREHENSION AND SWAYED BACKWARD AND
FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR
I LOOKED WITH INTEREST UPON THIS MAN WHO WAS ACCUSED OF BEING THE
PERPETRATOR OF A CRIME OF VIOLENCE
HE WAS FLAXEN HAIRED AND HANDSOME
IN A WASHED OUT NEGATIVE FASHION WITH FRIGHTENED BLUE EYES AND A
CLEAN SHAVEN FACE WITH A WEAK SENSITIVE MOUTH
HIS AGE MAY HAVE BEEN
ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN HIS DRESS AND BEARING THAT OF A GENTLEMAN
FROM THE
POCKET OF HIS LIGHT SUMMER OVERCOAT PROTRUDED THE BUNDLE OF INDORSED
PAPERS WHICH PROCLAIMED HIS PROFESSION
WE MUST USE WHAT TIME WE HAVE SAID HOLMES
WATSON WOULD YOU HAVE
THE KINDNESS TO TAKE THE PAPER AND TO READ THE PARAGRAPH IN QUESTION
UNDERNEATH THE VIGOROUS HEADLINES WHICH OUR CLIENT HAD QUOTED I READ
THE FOLLOWING SUGGESTIVE NARRATIVE
LATE LAST NIGHT OR EARLY THIS MORNING AN INCIDENT OCCURRED AT LOWER
NORWOOD WHICH POINTS IT IS FEARED TO A SERIOUS CRIME
MR
JONAS
OLDACRE IS A WELL KNOWN RESIDENT OF THAT SUBURB WHERE HE HAS CARRIED
ON HIS BUSINESS AS A BUILDER FOR MANY YEARS
MR
OLDACRE IS A BACHELOR
FIFTY TWO YEARS OF AGE AND LIVES IN DEEP DENE HOUSE AT THE SYDENHAM
END OF THE ROAD OF THAT NAME
HE HAS HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A
MAN OF ECCENTRIC HABITS SECRETIVE AND RETIRING
FOR SOME YEARS HE HAS
PRACTICALLY WITHDRAWN FROM THE BUSINESS IN WHICH HE IS SAID TO HAVE
MASSED CONSIDERABLE WEALTH
A SMALL TIMBER YARD STILL EXISTS HOWEVER
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE AND LAST NIGHT ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK AN ALARM
WAS GIVEN THAT ONE OF THE STACKS WAS ON FIRE
THE ENGINES WERE SOON UPON
THE SPOT BUT THE DRY WOOD BURNED WITH GREAT FURY AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
TO ARREST THE CONFLAGRATION UNTIL THE STACK HAD BEEN ENTIRELY CONSUMED
UP TO THIS POINT THE INCIDENT BORE THE APPEARANCE OF AN ORDINARY
ACCIDENT BUT FRESH INDICATIONS SEEM TO POINT TO SERIOUS CRIME
SURPRISE
WAS EXPRESSED AT THE ABSENCE OF THE MASTER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT FROM
THE SCENE OF THE FIRE AND AN INQUIRY FOLLOWED WHICH SHOWED THAT HE HAD
DISAPPEARED FROM THE HOUSE
AN EXAMINATION OF HIS ROOM REVEALED THAT THE
BED HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN THAT A SAFE WHICH STOOD IN IT WAS OPEN THAT
A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT PAPERS WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE ROOM AND FINALLY
THAT THERE WERE SIGNS OF A MURDEROUS STRUGGLE SLIGHT TRACES OF BLOOD
BEING FOUND WITHIN THE ROOM AND AN OAKEN WALKING STICK WHICH ALSO
SHOWED STAINS OF BLOOD UPON THE HANDLE
IT IS KNOWN THAT MR
JONAS
OLDACRE HAD RECEIVED A LATE VISITOR IN HIS BEDROOM UPON THAT NIGHT AND
THE STICK FOUND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE PROPERTY OF THIS PERSON WHO
IS A YOUNG LONDON SOLICITOR NAMED JOHN HECTOR MCFARLANE JUNIOR PARTNER
OF GRAHAM AND MCFARLANE OF 426 GRESHAM BUILDINGS E
C
THE POLICE
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE EVIDENCE IN THEIR POSSESSION WHICH SUPPLIES
A VERY CONVINCING MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME AND ALTOGETHER IT CANNOT BE
DOUBTED THAT SENSATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS WILL FOLLOW
LATER IT IS RUMOURED AS WE GO TO PRESS THAT MR
JOHN HECTOR MCFARLANE
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ARRESTED ON THE CHARGE OF THE MURDER OF MR
JONAS
OLDACRE
IT IS AT LEAST CERTAIN THAT A WARRANT HAS BEEN ISSUED
THERE
HAVE BEEN FURTHER AND SINISTER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INVESTIGATION AT
NORWOOD
BESIDES THE SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE IN THE ROOM OF THE UNFORTUNATE
BUILDER IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT THE FRENCH WINDOWS OF HIS BEDROOM WHICH IS
ON THE GROUND FLOOR WERE FOUND TO BE OPEN THAT THERE WERE MARKS AS
IF SOME BULKY OBJECT HAD BEEN DRAGGED ACROSS TO THE WOOD PILE AND
FINALLY IT IS ASSERTED THAT CHARRED REMAINS HAVE BEEN FOUND AMONG THE
CHARCOAL ASHES OF THE FIRE
THE POLICE THEORY IS THAT A MOST SENSATIONAL
CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED THAT THE VICTIM WAS CLUBBED TO DEATH IN HIS
OWN BEDROOM HIS PAPERS RIFLED AND HIS DEAD BODY DRAGGED ACROSS TO
THE WOOD STACK WHICH WAS THEN IGNITED SO AS TO HIDE ALL TRACES OF THE
CRIME
THE CONDUCT OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN LEFT IN
THE EXPERIENCED HANDS OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD WHO IS
FOLLOWING UP THE CLUES WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED ENERGY AND SAGACITY
SHERLOCK HOLMES LISTENED WITH CLOSED EYES AND FINGERTIPS TOGETHER TO
THIS REMARKABLE ACCOUNT
THE CASE HAS CERTAINLY SOME POINTS OF INTEREST SAID HE IN HIS
LANGUID FASHION
MAY I ASK IN THE FIRST PLACE MR
MCFARLANE HOW
IT IS THAT YOU ARE STILL AT LIBERTY SINCE THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH
EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY YOUR ARREST
I LIVE AT TORRINGTON LODGE BLACKHEATH WITH MY PARENTS MR
HOLMES
BUT LAST NIGHT HAVING TO DO BUSINESS VERY LATE WITH MR
JONAS OLDACRE
I STAYED AT AN HOTEL IN NORWOOD AND CAME TO MY BUSINESS FROM THERE
I
KNEW NOTHING OF THIS AFFAIR UNTIL I WAS IN THE TRAIN WHEN I READ WHAT
YOU HAVE JUST HEARD
I AT ONCE SAW THE HORRIBLE DANGER OF MY POSITION
AND I HURRIED TO PUT THE CASE INTO YOUR HANDS
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED EITHER AT MY CITY OFFICE OR AT MY HOME
A
MAN FOLLOWED ME FROM LONDON BRIDGE STATION AND I HAVE NO DOUBT GREAT
HEAVEN WHAT IS THAT
IT WAS A CLANG OF THE BELL FOLLOWED INSTANTLY BY HEAVY STEPS UPON THE
STAIR
A MOMENT LATER OUR OLD FRIEND LESTRADE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY
OVER HIS SHOULDER I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ONE OR TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMEN
OUTSIDE
MR
JOHN HECTOR MCFARLANE SAID LESTRADE
OUR UNFORTUNATE CLIENT ROSE WITH A GHASTLY FACE
I ARREST YOU FOR THE WILFUL MURDER OF MR
JONAS OLDACRE OF LOWER
NORWOOD
MCFARLANE TURNED TO US WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR AND SANK INTO HIS
CHAIR ONCE MORE LIKE ONE WHO IS CRUSHED
ONE MOMENT LESTRADE SAID HOLMES
HALF AN HOUR MORE OR LESS CAN MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU AND THE GENTLEMAN WAS ABOUT TO GIVE US AN ACCOUNT
OF THIS VERY INTERESTING AFFAIR WHICH MIGHT AID US IN CLEARING IT UP
I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY IN CLEARING IT UP SAID LESTRADE
GRIMLY
NONE THE LESS WITH YOUR PERMISSION I SHOULD BE MUCH INTERESTED TO
HEAR HIS ACCOUNT
WELL MR
HOLMES IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REFUSE YOU ANYTHING FOR
YOU HAVE BEEN OF USE TO THE FORCE ONCE OR TWICE IN THE PAST AND WE OWE
YOU A GOOD TURN AT SCOTLAND YARD SAID LESTRADE
AT THE SAME TIME I
MUST REMAIN WITH MY PRISONER AND I AM BOUND TO WARN HIM THAT ANYTHING
HE MAY SAY WILL APPEAR IN EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM
I WISH NOTHING BETTER SAID OUR CLIENT
ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU SHOULD
HEAR AND RECOGNIZE THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH
LESTRADE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
I'LL GIVE YOU HALF AN HOUR SAID HE
I MUST EXPLAIN FIRST SAID MCFARLANE THAT I KNEW NOTHING OF MR
JONAS OLDACRE
HIS NAME WAS FAMILIAR TO ME FOR MANY YEARS AGO MY
PARENTS WERE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM BUT THEY DRIFTED APART
I WAS VERY
MUCH SURPRISED THEREFORE WHEN YESTERDAY ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE
AFTERNOON HE WALKED INTO MY OFFICE IN THE CITY
BUT I WAS STILL MORE
ASTONISHED WHEN HE TOLD ME THE OBJECT OF HIS VISIT
HE HAD IN HIS HAND
SEVERAL SHEETS OF A NOTEBOOK COVERED WITH SCRIBBLED WRITING HERE THEY
ARE AND HE LAID THEM ON MY TABLE
'HERE IS MY WILL SAID HE
'I WANT YOU MR
MCFARLANE TO CAST IT INTO
PROPER LEGAL SHAPE
I WILL SIT HERE WHILE YOU DO SO
I SET MYSELF TO COPY IT AND YOU CAN IMAGINE MY ASTONISHMENT WHEN I
FOUND THAT WITH SOME RESERVATIONS HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS PROPERTY TO ME
HE WAS A STRANGE LITTLE FERRET LIKE MAN WITH WHITE EYELASHES AND WHEN
I LOOKED UP AT HIM I FOUND HIS KEEN GRAY EYES FIXED UPON ME WITH AN
AMUSED EXPRESSION
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY OWN AS I READ THE TERMS OF
THE WILL BUT HE EXPLAINED THAT HE WAS A BACHELOR WITH HARDLY ANY LIVING
RELATION THAT HE HAD KNOWN MY PARENTS IN HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE HAD
ALWAYS HEARD OF ME AS A VERY DESERVING YOUNG MAN AND WAS ASSURED THAT
HIS MONEY WOULD BE IN WORTHY HANDS
OF COURSE I COULD ONLY STAMMER
OUT MY THANKS
THE WILL WAS DULY FINISHED SIGNED AND WITNESSED BY
MY CLERK
THIS IS IT ON THE BLUE PAPER AND THESE SLIPS AS I HAVE
EXPLAINED ARE THE ROUGH DRAFT
MR
JONAS OLDACRE THEN INFORMED ME
THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS BUILDING LEASES TITLE DEEDS
MORTGAGES SCRIP AND SO FORTH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD SEE
AND UNDERSTAND
HE SAID THAT HIS MIND WOULD NOT BE EASY UNTIL THE WHOLE
THING WAS SETTLED AND HE BEGGED ME TO COME OUT TO HIS HOUSE AT
NORWOOD THAT NIGHT BRINGING THE WILL WITH ME AND TO ARRANGE MATTERS
'REMEMBER MY BOY NOT ONE WORD TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT THE AFFAIR UNTIL
EVERYTHING IS SETTLED
WE WILL KEEP IT AS A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR
THEM HE WAS VERY INSISTENT UPON THIS POINT AND MADE ME PROMISE IT
FAITHFULLY
YOU CAN IMAGINE MR
HOLMES THAT I WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR TO REFUSE HIM
ANYTHING THAT HE MIGHT ASK
HE WAS MY BENEFACTOR AND ALL MY DESIRE WAS
TO CARRY OUT HIS WISHES IN EVERY PARTICULAR
I SENT A TELEGRAM HOME
THEREFORE TO SAY THAT I HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS ON HAND AND THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY HOW LATE I MIGHT BE
MR
OLDACRE HAD TOLD ME
THAT HE WOULD LIKE ME TO HAVE SUPPER WITH HIM AT NINE AS HE MIGHT NOT
BE HOME BEFORE THAT HOUR
I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HIS HOUSE
HOWEVER AND IT WAS NEARLY HALF PAST BEFORE I REACHED IT
I FOUND
HIM
ONE MOMENT SAID HOLMES
WHO OPENED THE DOOR
A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN WHO WAS I SUPPOSE HIS HOUSEKEEPER
AND IT WAS SHE I PRESUME WHO MENTIONED YOUR NAME
EXACTLY SAID MCFARLANE
PRAY PROCEED
MCFARLANE WIPED HIS DAMP BROW AND THEN CONTINUED HIS NARRATIVE
I WAS SHOWN BY THIS WOMAN INTO A SITTING ROOM WHERE A FRUGAL SUPPER
WAS LAID OUT
AFTERWARDS MR
JONAS OLDACRE LED ME INTO HIS BEDROOM IN
WHICH THERE STOOD A HEAVY SAFE
THIS HE OPENED AND TOOK OUT A MASS OF
DOCUMENTS WHICH WE WENT OVER TOGETHER
IT WAS BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE
WHEN WE FINISHED
HE REMARKED THAT WE MUST NOT DISTURB THE HOUSEKEEPER
HE SHOWED ME OUT THROUGH HIS OWN FRENCH WINDOW WHICH HAD BEEN OPEN ALL
THIS TIME
WAS THE BLIND DOWN ASKED HOLMES
I WILL NOT BE SURE BUT I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ONLY HALF DOWN
YES I
REMEMBER HOW HE PULLED IT UP IN ORDER TO SWING OPEN THE WINDOW
I COULD
NOT FIND MY STICK AND HE SAID 'NEVER MIND MY BOY I SHALL SEE A GOOD
DEAL OF YOU NOW I HOPE AND I WILL KEEP YOUR STICK UNTIL YOU COME BACK
TO CLAIM IT I LEFT HIM THERE THE SAFE OPEN AND THE PAPERS MADE UP
IN PACKETS UPON THE TABLE
IT WAS SO LATE THAT I COULD NOT GET BACK TO
BLACKHEATH SO I SPENT THE NIGHT AT THE ANERLEY ARMS AND I KNEW NOTHING
MORE UNTIL I READ OF THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR IN THE MORNING
ANYTHING MORE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK MR
HOLMES SAID LESTRADE
WHOSE EYEBROWS HAD GONE UP ONCE OR TWICE DURING THIS REMARKABLE
EXPLANATION
NOT UNTIL I HAVE BEEN TO BLACKHEATH
YOU MEAN TO NORWOOD SAID LESTRADE
OH YES NO DOUBT THAT IS WHAT I MUST HAVE MEANT SAID HOLMES WITH
HIS ENIGMATICAL SMILE
LESTRADE HAD LEARNED BY MORE EXPERIENCES THAN HE
WOULD CARE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT BRAIN COULD CUT THROUGH THAT WHICH
WAS IMPENETRABLE TO HIM
I SAW HIM LOOK CURIOUSLY AT MY COMPANION
I THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A WORD WITH YOU PRESENTLY MR
SHERLOCK
HOLMES SAID HE
NOW MR
MCFARLANE TWO OF MY CONSTABLES ARE AT
THE DOOR AND THERE IS A FOUR WHEELER WAITING THE WRETCHED YOUNG MAN
AROSE AND WITH A LAST BESEECHING GLANCE AT US WALKED FROM THE ROOM
THE
OFFICERS CONDUCTED HIM TO THE CAB BUT LESTRADE REMAINED
HOLMES HAD PICKED UP THE PAGES WHICH FORMED THE ROUGH DRAFT OF THE WILL
AND WAS LOOKING AT THEM WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST UPON HIS FACE
THERE ARE SOME POINTS ABOUT THAT DOCUMENT LESTRADE ARE THERE NOT
SAID HE PUSHING THEM OVER
THE OFFICIAL LOOKED AT THEM WITH A PUZZLED EXPRESSION
I CAN READ THE FIRST FEW LINES AND THESE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND
PAGE AND ONE OR TWO AT THE END
THOSE ARE AS CLEAR AS PRINT SAID
HE BUT THE WRITING IN BETWEEN IS VERY BAD AND THERE ARE THREE PLACES
WHERE I CANNOT READ IT AT ALL
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SAID HOLMES
WELL WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN A TRAIN
THE GOOD WRITING REPRESENTS STATIONS
THE BAD WRITING MOVEMENT AND THE VERY BAD WRITING PASSING OVER POINTS
A SCIENTIFIC EXPERT WOULD PRONOUNCE AT ONCE THAT THIS WAS DRAWN UP ON A
SUBURBAN LINE SINCE NOWHERE SAVE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A GREAT
CITY COULD THERE BE SO QUICK A SUCCESSION OF POINTS
GRANTING THAT HIS
WHOLE JOURNEY WAS OCCUPIED IN DRAWING UP THE WILL THEN THE TRAIN WAS AN
EXPRESS ONLY STOPPING ONCE BETWEEN NORWOOD AND LONDON BRIDGE
LESTRADE BEGAN TO LAUGH
YOU ARE TOO MANY FOR ME WHEN YOU BEGIN TO GET ON YOUR THEORIES MR
HOLMES SAID HE
HOW DOES THIS BEAR ON THE CASE
WELL IT CORROBORATES THE YOUNG MAN'S STORY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE
WILL WAS DRAWN UP BY JONAS OLDACRE IN HIS JOURNEY YESTERDAY
IT IS
CURIOUS IS IT NOT THAT A MAN SHOULD DRAW UP SO IMPORTANT A DOCUMENT
IN SO HAPHAZARD A FASHION
IT SUGGESTS THAT HE DID NOT THINK IT WAS
GOING TO BE OF MUCH PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE
IF A MAN DREW UP A WILL WHICH
HE DID NOT INTEND EVER TO BE EFFECTIVE HE MIGHT DO IT SO
WELL HE DREW UP HIS OWN DEATH WARRANT AT THE SAME TIME SAID
LESTRADE
OH YOU THINK SO
DON'T YOU
WELL IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE BUT THE CASE IS NOT CLEAR TO ME YET
NOT CLEAR WELL IF THAT ISN'T CLEAR WHAT COULD BE CLEAR HERE IS A
YOUNG MAN WHO LEARNS SUDDENLY THAT IF A CERTAIN OLDER MAN DIES HE WILL
SUCCEED TO A FORTUNE
WHAT DOES HE DO HE SAYS NOTHING TO ANYONE BUT
HE ARRANGES THAT HE SHALL GO OUT ON SOME PRETEXT TO SEE HIS CLIENT THAT
NIGHT
HE WAITS UNTIL THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE IS IN BED AND
THEN IN THE SOLITUDE OF A MAN'S ROOM HE MURDERS HIM BURNS HIS BODY IN
THE WOOD PILE AND DEPARTS TO A NEIGHBOURING HOTEL
THE BLOOD STAINS IN
THE ROOM AND ALSO ON THE STICK ARE VERY SLIGHT
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE
IMAGINED HIS CRIME TO BE A BLOODLESS ONE AND HOPED THAT IF THE
BODY WERE CONSUMED IT WOULD HIDE ALL TRACES OF THE METHOD OF HIS
DEATH TRACES WHICH FOR SOME REASON MUST HAVE POINTED TO HIM
IS NOT
ALL THIS OBVIOUS
IT STRIKES ME MY GOOD LESTRADE AS BEING JUST A TRIFLE TOO OBVIOUS
SAID HOLMES
YOU DO NOT ADD IMAGINATION TO YOUR OTHER GREAT QUALITIES
BUT IF YOU COULD FOR ONE MOMENT PUT YOURSELF IN THE PLACE OF THIS YOUNG
MAN WOULD YOU CHOOSE THE VERY NIGHT AFTER THE WILL HAD BEEN MADE TO
COMMIT YOUR CRIME WOULD IT NOT SEEM DANGEROUS TO YOU TO MAKE SO VERY
CLOSE A RELATION BETWEEN THE TWO INCIDENTS AGAIN WOULD YOU CHOOSE AN
OCCASION WHEN YOU ARE KNOWN TO BE IN THE HOUSE WHEN A SERVANT HAS LET
YOU IN AND FINALLY WOULD YOU TAKE THE GREAT PAINS TO CONCEAL THE
BODY AND YET LEAVE YOUR OWN STICK AS A SIGN THAT YOU WERE THE CRIMINAL
CONFESS LESTRADE THAT ALL THIS IS VERY UNLIKELY
AS TO THE STICK MR
HOLMES YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT A CRIMINAL
IS OFTEN FLURRIED AND DOES SUCH THINGS WHICH A COOL MAN WOULD AVOID
HE WAS VERY LIKELY AFRAID TO GO BACK TO THE ROOM
GIVE ME ANOTHER THEORY
THAT WOULD FIT THE FACTS
I COULD VERY EASILY GIVE YOU HALF A DOZEN SAID HOLMES
HERE FOR
EXAMPLE IS A VERY POSSIBLE AND EVEN PROBABLE ONE
I MAKE YOU A FREE
PRESENT OF IT
THE OLDER MAN IS SHOWING DOCUMENTS WHICH ARE OF EVIDENT
VALUE
A PASSING TRAMP SEES THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE BLIND OF WHICH
IS ONLY HALF DOWN
EXIT THE SOLICITOR
ENTER THE TRAMP HE SEIZES A
STICK WHICH HE OBSERVES THERE KILLS OLDACRE AND DEPARTS AFTER BURNING
THE BODY
WHY SHOULD THE TRAMP BURN THE BODY
FOR THE MATTER OF THAT WHY SHOULD MCFARLANE
TO HIDE SOME EVIDENCE
POSSIBLY THE TRAMP WANTED TO HIDE THAT ANY MURDER AT ALL HAD BEEN
COMMITTED
AND WHY DID THE TRAMP TAKE NOTHING
BECAUSE THEY WERE PAPERS THAT HE COULD NOT NEGOTIATE
LESTRADE SHOOK HIS HEAD THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HIS MANNER WAS LESS
ABSOLUTELY ASSURED THAN BEFORE
WELL MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU MAY LOOK FOR YOUR TRAMP AND WHILE YOU
ARE FINDING HIM WE WILL HOLD ON TO OUR MAN
THE FUTURE WILL SHOW WHICH
IS RIGHT
JUST NOTICE THIS POINT MR
HOLMES THAT SO FAR AS WE KNOW
NONE OF THE PAPERS WERE REMOVED AND THAT THE PRISONER IS THE ONE MAN IN
THE WORLD WHO HAD NO REASON FOR REMOVING THEM SINCE HE WAS HEIR AT LAW
AND WOULD COME INTO THEM IN ANY CASE
MY FRIEND SEEMED STRUCK BY THIS REMARK
I DON'T MEAN TO DENY THAT THE EVIDENCE IS IN SOME WAYS VERY STRONGLY
IN FAVOUR OF YOUR THEORY SAID HE
I ONLY WISH TO POINT OUT THAT
THERE ARE OTHER THEORIES POSSIBLE
AS YOU SAY THE FUTURE WILL DECIDE
GOOD MORNING I DARE SAY THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I SHALL DROP IN
AT NORWOOD AND SEE HOW YOU ARE GETTING ON
WHEN THE DETECTIVE DEPARTED MY FRIEND ROSE AND MADE HIS PREPARATIONS
FOR THE DAY'S WORK WITH THE ALERT AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS A CONGENIAL TASK
BEFORE HIM
MY FIRST MOVEMENT WATSON SAID HE AS HE BUSTLED INTO HIS FROCKCOAT
MUST AS I SAID BE IN THE DIRECTION OF BLACKHEATH
AND WHY NOT NORWOOD
BECAUSE WE HAVE IN THIS CASE ONE SINGULAR INCIDENT COMING CLOSE TO THE
HEELS OF ANOTHER SINGULAR INCIDENT
THE POLICE ARE MAKING THE MISTAKE OF
CONCENTRATING THEIR ATTENTION UPON THE SECOND BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO
BE THE ONE WHICH IS ACTUALLY CRIMINAL
BUT IT IS EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE
LOGICAL WAY TO APPROACH THE CASE IS TO BEGIN BY TRYING TO THROW SOME
LIGHT UPON THE FIRST INCIDENT THE CURIOUS WILL SO SUDDENLY MADE AND
TO SO UNEXPECTED AN HEIR
IT MAY DO SOMETHING TO SIMPLIFY WHAT FOLLOWED
NO MY DEAR FELLOW I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HELP ME
THERE IS NO PROSPECT
OF DANGER OR I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF STIRRING OUT WITHOUT YOU
I TRUST
THAT WHEN I SEE YOU IN THE EVENING I WILL BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT I HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE YOUNGSTER WHO HAS THROWN
HIMSELF UPON MY PROTECTION
IT WAS LATE WHEN MY FRIEND RETURNED AND I COULD SEE BY A GLANCE AT HIS
HAGGARD AND ANXIOUS FACE THAT THE HIGH HOPES WITH WHICH HE HAD STARTED
HAD NOT BEEN FULFILLED
FOR AN HOUR HE DRONED AWAY UPON HIS VIOLIN
ENDEAVOURING TO SOOTHE HIS OWN RUFFLED SPIRITS
AT LAST HE FLUNG
DOWN THE INSTRUMENT AND PLUNGED INTO A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HIS
MISADVENTURES
IT'S ALL GOING WRONG WATSON ALL AS WRONG AS IT CAN GO
I KEPT A BOLD
FACE BEFORE LESTRADE BUT UPON MY SOUL I BELIEVE THAT FOR ONCE THE
FELLOW IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND WE ARE ON THE WRONG
ALL MY INSTINCTS
ARE ONE WAY AND ALL THE FACTS ARE THE OTHER AND I MUCH FEAR THAT
BRITISH JURIES HAVE NOT YET ATTAINED THAT PITCH OF INTELLIGENCE WHEN
THEY WILL GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO MY THEORIES OVER LESTRADE'S FACTS
DID YOU GO TO BLACKHEATH
YES WATSON I WENT THERE AND I FOUND VERY QUICKLY THAT THE LATE
LAMENTED OLDACRE WAS A PRETTY CONSIDERABLE BLACKGUARD
THE FATHER WAS
AWAY IN SEARCH OF HIS SON
THE MOTHER WAS AT HOME A LITTLE FLUFFY
BLUE EYED PERSON IN A TREMOR OF FEAR AND INDIGNATION
OF COURSE SHE
WOULD NOT ADMIT EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF HIS GUILT
BUT SHE WOULD NOT
EXPRESS EITHER SURPRISE OR REGRET OVER THE FATE OF OLDACRE
ON
THE CONTRARY SHE SPOKE OF HIM WITH SUCH BITTERNESS THAT SHE WAS
UNCONSCIOUSLY CONSIDERABLY STRENGTHENING THE CASE OF THE POLICE FOR OF
COURSE IF HER SON HAD HEARD HER SPEAK OF THE MAN IN THIS FASHION IT
WOULD PREDISPOSE HIM TOWARDS HATRED AND VIOLENCE
'HE WAS MORE LIKE A
MALIGNANT AND CUNNING APE THAN A HUMAN BEING SAID SHE 'AND HE ALWAYS
WAS EVER SINCE HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
'YOU KNEW HIM AT THAT TIME SAID I
'YES I KNEW HIM WELL IN FACT HE WAS AN OLD SUITOR OF MINE
THANK
HEAVEN THAT I HAD THE SENSE TO TURN AWAY FROM HIM AND TO MARRY A
BETTER IF POORER MAN
I WAS ENGAGED TO HIM MR
HOLMES WHEN I HEARD A
SHOCKING STORY OF HOW HE HAD TURNED A CAT LOOSE IN AN AVIARY AND I WAS
SO HORRIFIED AT HIS BRUTAL CRUELTY THAT I WOULD HAVE NOTHING MORE TO
DO WITH HIM SHE RUMMAGED IN A BUREAU AND PRESENTLY SHE PRODUCED A
PHOTOGRAPH OF A WOMAN SHAMEFULLY DEFACED AND MUTILATED WITH A KNIFE
'THAT IS MY OWN PHOTOGRAPH SHE SAID
'HE SENT IT TO ME IN THAT STATE
WITH HIS CURSE UPON MY WEDDING MORNING
'WELL SAID I 'AT LEAST HE HAS FORGIVEN YOU NOW SINCE HE HAS LEFT
ALL HIS PROPERTY TO YOUR SON
'NEITHER MY SON NOR I WANT ANYTHING FROM JONAS OLDACRE DEAD OR ALIVE
SHE CRIED WITH A PROPER SPIRIT
'THERE IS A GOD IN HEAVEN MR
HOLMES
AND THAT SAME GOD WHO HAS PUNISHED THAT WICKED MAN WILL SHOW IN HIS OWN
GOOD TIME THAT MY SON'S HANDS ARE GUILTLESS OF HIS BLOOD
WELL I TRIED ONE OR TWO LEADS BUT COULD GET AT NOTHING WHICH WOULD
HELP OUR HYPOTHESIS AND SEVERAL POINTS WHICH WOULD MAKE AGAINST IT
I
GAVE IT UP AT LAST AND OFF I WENT TO NORWOOD
THIS PLACE DEEP DENE HOUSE IS A BIG MODERN VILLA OF STARING BRICK
STANDING BACK IN ITS OWN GROUNDS WITH A LAUREL CLUMPED LAWN IN FRONT
OF IT
TO THE RIGHT AND SOME DISTANCE BACK FROM THE ROAD WAS THE
TIMBER YARD WHICH HAD BEEN THE SCENE OF THE FIRE
HERE'S A ROUGH PLAN
ON A LEAF OF MY NOTEBOOK
THIS WINDOW ON THE LEFT IS THE ONE WHICH OPENS
INTO OLDACRE'S ROOM
YOU CAN LOOK INTO IT FROM THE ROAD YOU SEE
THAT
IS ABOUT THE ONLY BIT OF CONSOLATION I HAVE HAD TO DAY
LESTRADE WAS
NOT THERE BUT HIS HEAD CONSTABLE DID THE HONOURS
THEY HAD JUST FOUND A
GREAT TREASURE TROVE
THEY HAD SPENT THE MORNING RAKING AMONG THE ASHES
OF THE BURNED WOOD PILE AND BESIDES THE CHARRED ORGANIC REMAINS THEY
HAD SECURED SEVERAL DISCOLOURED METAL DISCS
I EXAMINED THEM WITH
CARE AND THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THEY WERE TROUSER BUTTONS
I EVEN
DISTINGUISHED THAT ONE OF THEM WAS MARKED WITH THE NAME OF 'HYAMS WHO
WAS OLDACRES TAILOR
I THEN WORKED THE LAWN VERY CAREFULLY FOR SIGNS AND
TRACES BUT THIS DROUGHT HAS MADE EVERYTHING AS HARD AS IRON
NOTHING
WAS TO BE SEEN SAVE THAT SOME BODY OR BUNDLE HAD BEEN DRAGGED THROUGH
A LOW PRIVET HEDGE WHICH IS IN A LINE WITH THE WOOD PILE
ALL THAT OF
COURSE FITS IN WITH THE OFFICIAL THEORY
I CRAWLED ABOUT THE LAWN WITH
AN AUGUST SUN ON MY BACK BUT I GOT UP AT THE END OF AN HOUR NO WISER
THAN BEFORE
WELL AFTER THIS FIASCO I WENT INTO THE BEDROOM AND EXAMINED THAT ALSO
THE BLOOD STAINS WERE VERY SLIGHT MERE SMEARS AND DISCOLOURATIONS BUT
UNDOUBTEDLY FRESH
THE STICK HAD BEEN REMOVED BUT THERE ALSO THE MARKS
WERE SLIGHT
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE STICK BELONGING TO OUR CLIENT
HE ADMITS IT
FOOTMARKS OF BOTH MEN COULD BE MADE OUT ON THE CARPET
BUT NONE OF ANY THIRD PERSON WHICH AGAIN IS A TRICK FOR THE OTHER
SIDE
THEY WERE PILING UP THEIR SCORE ALL THE TIME AND WE WERE AT A
STANDSTILL
ONLY ONE LITTLE GLEAM OF HOPE DID I GET AND YET IT AMOUNTED TO
NOTHING
I EXAMINED THE CONTENTS OF THE SAFE MOST OF WHICH HAD BEEN
TAKEN OUT AND LEFT ON THE TABLE
THE PAPERS HAD BEEN MADE UP INTO SEALED
ENVELOPES ONE OR TWO OF WHICH HAD BEEN OPENED BY THE POLICE
THEY WERE
NOT SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE OF ANY GREAT VALUE NOR DID THE BANK BOOK
SHOW THAT MR
OLDACRE WAS IN SUCH VERY AFFLUENT CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT ALL THE PAPERS WERE NOT THERE
THERE WERE ALLUSIONS TO
SOME DEEDS POSSIBLY THE MORE VALUABLE WHICH I COULD NOT FIND
THIS OF
COURSE IF WE COULD DEFINITELY PROVE IT WOULD TURN LESTRADE'S ARGUMENT
AGAINST HIMSELF FOR WHO WOULD STEAL A THING IF HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD
SHORTLY INHERIT IT
FINALLY HAVING DRAWN EVERY OTHER COVER AND PICKED UP NO SCENT I TRIED
MY LUCK WITH THE HOUSEKEEPER
MRS
LEXINGTON IS HER NAME A LITTLE
DARK SILENT PERSON WITH SUSPICIOUS AND SIDELONG EYES
SHE COULD TELL
US SOMETHING IF SHE WOULD I AM CONVINCED OF IT
BUT SHE WAS AS CLOSE AS
WAX
YES SHE HAD LET MR
MCFARLANE IN AT HALF PAST NINE
SHE WISHED
HER HAND HAD WITHERED BEFORE SHE HAD DONE SO
SHE HAD GONE TO BED AT
HALF PAST TEN
HER ROOM WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE AND SHE COULD
HEAR NOTHING OF WHAT HAD PASSED
MR
MCFARLANE HAD LEFT HIS HAT AND TO
THE BEST OF HER BELIEF HIS STICK IN THE HALL
SHE
HAD BEEN AWAKENED BY THE ALARM OF FIRE
HER POOR DEAR
MASTER HAD CERTAINLY BEEN MURDERED
HAD HE ANY ENEMIES WELL EVERY MAN
HAD ENEMIES BUT MR
OLDACRE KEPT HIMSELF VERY MUCH TO HIMSELF AND ONLY
MET PEOPLE IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS
SHE HAD SEEN THE BUTTONS AND WAS
SURE THAT THEY BELONGED TO THE CLOTHES WHICH HE HAD WORN LAST NIGHT
THE WOOD PILE WAS VERY DRY FOR IT HAD NOT RAINED FOR A MONTH
IT BURNED
LIKE TINDER AND BY THE TIME SHE REACHED THE SPOT NOTHING COULD BE SEEN
BUT FLAMES
SHE AND ALL THE FIREMEN SMELLED THE BURNED FLESH FROM
INSIDE IT
SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PAPERS NOR OF MR
OLDACRE'S PRIVATE
AFFAIRS
SO MY DEAR WATSON THERE'S MY REPORT OF A FAILURE
AND YET AND YET
HE CLENCHED HIS THIN HANDS IN A PAROXYSM OF CONVICTION I KNOW IT'S ALL
WRONG
I FEEL IT IN MY BONES
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT COME OUT
AND THAT HOUSEKEEPER KNOWS IT
THERE WAS A SORT OF SULKY DEFIANCE IN HER
EYES WHICH ONLY GOES WITH GUILTY KNOWLEDGE
HOWEVER THERE'S NO GOOD
TALKING ANY MORE ABOUT IT WATSON BUT UNLESS SOME LUCKY CHANCE COMES
OUR WAY I FEAR THAT THE NORWOOD DISAPPEARANCE CASE WILL NOT FIGURE IN
THAT CHRONICLE OF OUR SUCCESSES WHICH I FORESEE THAT A PATIENT PUBLIC
WILL SOONER OR LATER HAVE TO ENDURE
SURELY SAID I THE MAN'S APPEARANCE WOULD GO FAR WITH ANY JURY
THAT IS A DANGEROUS ARGUMENT MY DEAR WATSON
YOU REMEMBER THAT TERRIBLE
MURDERER BERT STEVENS WHO WANTED US TO GET HIM OFF IN '87 WAS THERE
EVER A MORE MILD MANNERED SUNDAY SCHOOL YOUNG MAN
IT IS TRUE
UNLESS WE SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING AN ALTERNATIVE THEORY THIS MAN IS
LOST
YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A FLAW IN THE CASE WHICH CAN NOW BE PRESENTED
AGAINST HIM AND ALL FURTHER INVESTIGATION HAS SERVED TO STRENGTHEN IT
BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE CURIOUS LITTLE POINT ABOUT THOSE PAPERS WHICH
MAY SERVE US AS THE STARTING POINT FOR AN INQUIRY
ON LOOKING OVER THE
BANK BOOK I FOUND THAT THE LOW STATE OF THE BALANCE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE
TO LARGE CHECKS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE OUT DURING THE LAST YEAR TO MR
CORNELIUS
I CONFESS THAT I SHOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHO THIS
MR
CORNELIUS MAY BE WITH WHOM A RETIRED BUILDER HAS SUCH VERY LARGE
TRANSACTIONS
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE HAS HAD A HAND IN THE AFFAIR
CORNELIUS MIGHT BE A BROKER BUT WE HAVE FOUND NO SCRIP TO CORRESPOND
WITH THESE LARGE PAYMENTS
FAILING ANY OTHER INDICATION MY RESEARCHES
MUST NOW TAKE THE DIRECTION OF AN INQUIRY AT THE BANK FOR THE GENTLEMAN
WHO HAS CASHED THESE CHECKS
BUT I FEAR MY DEAR FELLOW THAT OUR
CASE WILL END INGLORIOUSLY BY LESTRADE HANGING OUR CLIENT WHICH WILL
CERTAINLY BE A TRIUMPH FOR SCOTLAND YARD
I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK ANY SLEEP THAT NIGHT BUT
WHEN I CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST I FOUND HIM PALE AND HARASSED HIS BRIGHT
EYES THE BRIGHTER FOR THE DARK SHADOWS ROUND THEM
THE CARPET ROUND HIS
CHAIR WAS LITTERED WITH CIGARETTE ENDS AND WITH THE EARLY EDITIONS OF
THE MORNING PAPERS
AN OPEN TELEGRAM LAY UPON THE TABLE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS WATSON HE ASKED TOSSING IT ACROSS
IT WAS FROM NORWOOD AND RAN AS FOLLOWS
IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE TO HAND
MCFARLANE'S GUILT DEFINITELY
ESTABLISHED
ADVISE YOU TO ABANDON CASE
LESTRADE
THIS SOUNDS SERIOUS SAID I
IT IS LESTRADE'S LITTLE COCK A DOODLE OF VICTORY HOLMES ANSWERED
WITH A BITTER SMILE
AND YET IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO ABANDON THE CASE
AFTER ALL IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE IS A TWO EDGED THING AND MAY
POSSIBLY CUT IN A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION TO THAT WHICH LESTRADE
IMAGINES
TAKE YOUR BREAKFAST WATSON AND WE WILL GO OUT TOGETHER AND
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
I FEEL AS IF I SHALL NEED YOUR COMPANY AND YOUR
MORAL SUPPORT TODAY
MY FRIEND HAD NO BREAKFAST HIMSELF FOR IT WAS ONE OF HIS PECULIARITIES
THAT IN HIS MORE INTENSE MOMENTS HE WOULD PERMIT HIMSELF NO FOOD AND I
HAVE KNOWN HIM PRESUME UPON HIS IRON STRENGTH UNTIL HE HAS FAINTED FROM
PURE INANITION
AT PRESENT I CANNOT SPARE ENERGY AND NERVE FORCE FOR
DIGESTION HE WOULD SAY IN ANSWER TO MY MEDICAL REMONSTRANCES
I WAS
NOT SURPRISED THEREFORE WHEN THIS MORNING HE LEFT HIS UNTOUCHED
MEAL BEHIND HIM AND STARTED WITH ME FOR NORWOOD
A CROWD OF MORBID
SIGHTSEERS WERE STILL GATHERED ROUND DEEP DENE HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST
SUCH A SUBURBAN VILLA AS I HAD PICTURED
WITHIN THE GATES LESTRADE MET
US HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH VICTORY HIS MANNER GROSSLY TRIUMPHANT
WELL MR
HOLMES HAVE YOU PROVED US TO BE WRONG YET HAVE YOU FOUND
YOUR TRAMP HE CRIED
I HAVE FORMED NO CONCLUSION WHATEVER MY COMPANION ANSWERED
BUT WE FORMED OURS YESTERDAY AND NOW IT PROVES TO BE CORRECT SO YOU
MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN A LITTLE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS TIME
MR
HOLMES
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE THE AIR OF SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAVING OCCURRED SAID
HOLMES
LESTRADE LAUGHED LOUDLY
YOU DON'T LIKE BEING BEATEN ANY MORE THAN THE REST OF US DO SAID HE
A MAN CAN'T EXPECT ALWAYS TO HAVE IT HIS OWN WAY CAN HE DR
WATSON
STEP THIS WAY IF YOU PLEASE GENTLEMEN AND I THINK I CAN CONVINCE YOU
ONCE FOR ALL THAT IT WAS JOHN MCFARLANE WHO DID THIS CRIME
HE LED US THROUGH THE PASSAGE AND OUT INTO A DARK HALL BEYOND
THIS IS WHERE YOUNG MCFARLANE MUST HAVE COME OUT TO GET HIS HAT
AFTER THE CRIME WAS DONE SAID HE
NOW LOOK AT THIS WITH DRAMATIC
SUDDENNESS HE STRUCK A MATCH AND BY ITS LIGHT EXPOSED A STAIN OF BLOOD
UPON THE WHITEWASHED WALL
AS HE HELD THE MATCH NEARER I SAW THAT IT
WAS MORE THAN A STAIN
IT WAS THE WELL MARKED PRINT OF A THUMB
LOOK AT THAT WITH YOUR MAGNIFYING GLASS MR
HOLMES
YES I AM DOING SO
YOU ARE AWARE THAT NO TWO THUMB MARKS ARE ALIKE
I HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF THE KIND
WELL THEN WILL YOU PLEASE COMPARE THAT PRINT WITH THIS WAX IMPRESSION
OF YOUNG MCFARLANE'S RIGHT THUMB TAKEN BY MY ORDERS THIS MORNING
AS HE HELD THE WAXEN PRINT CLOSE TO THE BLOOD STAIN IT DID NOT TAKE
A MAGNIFYING GLASS TO SEE THAT THE TWO WERE UNDOUBTEDLY FROM THE SAME
THUMB
IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT OUR UNFORTUNATE CLIENT WAS LOST
THAT IS FINAL SAID LESTRADE
YES THAT IS FINAL I INVOLUNTARILY ECHOED
IT IS FINAL SAID HOLMES
SOMETHING IN HIS TONE CAUGHT MY EAR AND I TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM
AN
EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE HAD COME OVER HIS FACE
IT WAS WRITHING WITH INWARD
MERRIMENT
HIS TWO EYES WERE SHINING LIKE STARS
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
HE WAS MAKING DESPERATE EFFORTS TO RESTRAIN A CONVULSIVE ATTACK OF
LAUGHTER
DEAR ME DEAR ME HE SAID AT LAST
WELL NOW WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
IT AND HOW DECEPTIVE APPEARANCES MAY BE TO BE SURE SUCH A NICE YOUNG
MAN TO LOOK AT IT IS A LESSON TO US NOT TO TRUST OUR OWN JUDGMENT IS
IT NOT LESTRADE
YES SOME OF US ARE A LITTLE TOO MUCH INCLINED TO BE COCK SURE MR
HOLMES SAID LESTRADE
THE MAN'S INSOLENCE WAS MADDENING BUT WE COULD
NOT RESENT IT
WHAT A PROVIDENTIAL THING THAT THIS YOUNG MAN SHOULD PRESS HIS RIGHT
THUMB AGAINST THE WALL IN TAKING HIS HAT FROM THE PEG SUCH A VERY
NATURAL ACTION TOO IF YOU COME TO THINK OF IT HOLMES WAS OUTWARDLY
CALM BUT HIS WHOLE BODY GAVE A WRIGGLE OF SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT AS HE
SPOKE
BY THE WAY LESTRADE WHO MADE THIS REMARKABLE DISCOVERY
IT WAS THE HOUSEKEEPER MRS
LEXINGTON WHO DREW THE NIGHT CONSTABLE'S
ATTENTION TO IT
WHERE WAS THE NIGHT CONSTABLE
HE REMAINED ON GUARD IN THE BEDROOM WHERE THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED SO
AS TO SEE THAT NOTHING WAS TOUCHED
BUT WHY DIDN'T THE POLICE SEE THIS MARK YESTERDAY
WELL WE HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO MAKE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE
HALL
BESIDES IT'S NOT IN A VERY PROMINENT PLACE AS YOU SEE
NO NO OF COURSE NOT
I SUPPOSE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE MARK WAS
THERE YESTERDAY
LESTRADE LOOKED AT HOLMES AS IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING OUT OF HIS MIND
I CONFESS THAT I WAS MYSELF SURPRISED BOTH AT HIS HILARIOUS MANNER AND
AT HIS RATHER WILD OBSERVATION
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU THINK THAT MCFARLANE CAME OUT OF JAIL IN THE
DEAD OF THE NIGHT IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIMSELF
SAID LESTRADE
I LEAVE IT TO ANY EXPERT IN THE WORLD WHETHER THAT IS
NOT THE MARK OF HIS THUMB
IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY THE MARK OF HIS THUMB
THERE THAT'S ENOUGH SAID LESTRADE
I AM A PRACTICAL MAN MR
HOLMES AND WHEN I HAVE GOT MY EVIDENCE I COME TO MY CONCLUSIONS
IF
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY YOU WILL FIND ME WRITING MY REPORT IN THE
SITTING ROOM
HOLMES HAD RECOVERED HIS EQUANIMITY THOUGH I STILL SEEMED TO DETECT
GLEAMS OF AMUSEMENT IN HIS EXPRESSION
DEAR ME THIS IS A VERY SAD DEVELOPMENT WATSON IS IT NOT SAID HE
AND YET THERE ARE SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT IT WHICH HOLD OUT SOME HOPES
FOR OUR CLIENT
I AM DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT SAID I HEARTILY
I WAS AFRAID IT WAS ALL
UP WITH HIM
I WOULD HARDLY GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT MY DEAR WATSON
THE FACT IS
THAT THERE IS ONE REALLY SERIOUS FLAW IN THIS EVIDENCE TO WHICH OUR
FRIEND ATTACHES SO MUCH IMPORTANCE
INDEED HOLMES WHAT IS IT
ONLY THIS THAT I KNOW THAT THAT MARK WAS NOT THERE WHEN I EXAMINED THE
HALL YESTERDAY
AND NOW WATSON LET US HAVE A LITTLE STROLL ROUND IN
THE SUNSHINE
WITH A CONFUSED BRAIN BUT WITH A HEART INTO WHICH SOME WARMTH OF HOPE
WAS RETURNING I ACCOMPANIED MY FRIEND IN A WALK ROUND THE GARDEN
HOLMES TOOK EACH FACE OF THE HOUSE IN TURN AND EXAMINED IT WITH GREAT
INTEREST
HE THEN LED THE WAY INSIDE AND WENT OVER THE WHOLE BUILDING
FROM BASEMENT TO ATTIC
MOST OF THE ROOMS WERE UNFURNISHED BUT NONE THE
LESS HOLMES INSPECTED THEM ALL MINUTELY
FINALLY ON THE TOP CORRIDOR
WHICH RAN OUTSIDE THREE UNTENANTED BEDROOMS HE AGAIN WAS SEIZED WITH A
SPASM OF MERRIMENT
THERE ARE REALLY SOME VERY UNIQUE FEATURES ABOUT THIS CASE WATSON
SAID HE
I THINK IT IS TIME NOW THAT WE TOOK OUR FRIEND LESTRADE INTO
OUR CONFIDENCE
HE HAS HAD HIS LITTLE SMILE AT OUR EXPENSE AND PERHAPS
WE MAY DO AS MUCH BY HIM IF MY READING OF THIS PROBLEM PROVES TO BE
CORRECT
YES YES I THINK I SEE HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH IT
THE SCOTLAND YARD INSPECTOR WAS STILL WRITING IN THE PARLOUR WHEN HOLMES
INTERRUPTED HIM
I UNDERSTOOD THAT YOU WERE WRITING A REPORT OF THIS CASE SAID HE
SO I AM
DON'T YOU THINK IT MAY BE A LITTLE PREMATURE I CAN'T HELP THINKING
THAT YOUR EVIDENCE IS NOT COMPLETE
LESTRADE KNEW MY FRIEND TOO WELL TO DISREGARD HIS WORDS
HE LAID DOWN
HIS PEN AND LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT HIM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN MR
HOLMES
ONLY THAT THERE IS AN IMPORTANT WITNESS WHOM YOU HAVE NOT SEEN
CAN YOU PRODUCE HIM
I THINK I CAN
THEN DO SO
I WILL DO MY BEST
HOW MANY CONSTABLES HAVE YOU
THERE ARE THREE WITHIN CALL
EXCELLENT SAID HOLMES
MAY I ASK IF THEY ARE ALL LARGE ABLE BODIED
MEN WITH POWERFUL VOICES
I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE THOUGH I FAIL TO SEE WHAT THEIR VOICES HAVE
TO DO WITH IT
PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU TO SEE THAT AND ONE OR TWO OTHER THINGS AS
WELL SAID HOLMES
KINDLY SUMMON YOUR MEN AND I WILL TRY
FIVE MINUTES LATER THREE POLICEMEN HAD ASSEMBLED IN THE HALL
IN THE OUTHOUSE YOU WILL FIND A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF STRAW SAID
HOLMES
I WILL ASK YOU TO CARRY IN TWO BUNDLES OF IT
I THINK IT WILL
BE OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE IN PRODUCING THE WITNESS WHOM I REQUIRE
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME MATCHES IN YOUR POCKET
WATSON
NOW MR
LESTRADE I WILL ASK YOU ALL TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE TOP
LANDING
AS I HAVE SAID THERE WAS A BROAD CORRIDOR THERE WHICH RAN OUTSIDE
THREE EMPTY BEDROOMS
AT ONE END OF THE CORRIDOR WE WERE ALL MARSHALLED
BY SHERLOCK HOLMES THE CONSTABLES GRINNING AND LESTRADE STARING AT
MY FRIEND WITH AMAZEMENT EXPECTATION AND DERISION CHASING EACH OTHER
ACROSS HIS FEATURES
HOLMES STOOD BEFORE US WITH THE AIR OF A CONJURER
WHO IS PERFORMING A TRICK
WOULD YOU KINDLY SEND ONE OF YOUR CONSTABLES FOR TWO BUCKETS OF WATER
PUT THE STRAW ON THE FLOOR HERE FREE FROM THE WALL ON EITHER SIDE
NOW
I THINK THAT WE ARE ALL READY
LESTRADE'S FACE HAD BEGUN TO GROW RED AND ANGRY
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU ARE PLAYING A GAME WITH US MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID HE
IF YOU
KNOW ANYTHING YOU CAN SURELY SAY IT WITHOUT ALL THIS TOMFOOLERY
I ASSURE YOU MY GOOD LESTRADE THAT I HAVE AN EXCELLENT REASON FOR
EVERYTHING THAT I DO
YOU MAY POSSIBLY REMEMBER THAT YOU CHAFFED ME A
LITTLE SOME HOURS AGO WHEN THE SUN SEEMED ON YOUR SIDE OF THE HEDGE
SO YOU MUST NOT GRUDGE ME A LITTLE POMP AND CEREMONY NOW
MIGHT I ASK
YOU WATSON TO OPEN THAT WINDOW AND THEN TO PUT A MATCH TO THE EDGE OF
THE STRAW
I DID SO AND DRIVEN BY THE DRAUGHT A COIL OF GRAY SMOKE SWIRLED DOWN
THE CORRIDOR WHILE THE DRY STRAW CRACKLED AND FLAMED
NOW WE MUST SEE IF WE CAN FIND THIS WITNESS FOR YOU LESTRADE
MIGHT
I ASK YOU ALL TO JOIN IN THE CRY OF 'FIRE NOW THEN ONE TWO
THREE
FIRE WE ALL YELLED
THANK YOU
I WILL TROUBLE YOU ONCE AGAIN
FIRE
JUST ONCE MORE GENTLEMEN AND ALL TOGETHER
FIRE THE SHOUT MUST HAVE RUNG OVER NORWOOD
IT HAD HARDLY DIED AWAY WHEN AN AMAZING THING HAPPENED
A DOOR SUDDENLY
FLEW OPEN OUT OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE SOLID WALL AT THE END OF THE
CORRIDOR AND A LITTLE WIZENED MAN DARTED OUT OF IT LIKE A RABBIT OUT
OF ITS BURROW
CAPITAL SAID HOLMES CALMLY
WATSON A BUCKET OF WATER OVER THE
STRAW
THAT WILL DO LESTRADE ALLOW ME TO PRESENT YOU WITH YOUR
PRINCIPAL MISSING WITNESS MR
JONAS OLDACRE
THE DETECTIVE STARED AT THE NEWCOMER WITH BLANK AMAZEMENT
THE LATTER
WAS BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE CORRIDOR AND PEERING AT US
AND AT THE SMOULDERING FIRE
IT WAS AN ODIOUS FACE CRAFTY VICIOUS
MALIGNANT WITH SHIFTY LIGHT GRAY EYES AND WHITE LASHES
WHAT'S THIS THEN SAID LESTRADE AT LAST
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
ALL THIS TIME EH
OLDACRE GAVE AN UNEASY LAUGH SHRINKING BACK FROM THE FURIOUS RED FACE
OF THE ANGRY DETECTIVE
I HAVE DONE NO HARM
NO HARM YOU HAVE DONE YOUR BEST TO GET AN INNOCENT MAN HANGED
IF IT
WASN'T FOR THIS GENTLEMAN HERE I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
SUCCEEDED
THE WRETCHED CREATURE BEGAN TO WHIMPER
I AM SURE SIR IT WAS ONLY MY PRACTICAL JOKE
OH A JOKE WAS IT YOU WON'T FIND THE LAUGH ON YOUR SIDE I PROMISE
YOU
TAKE HIM DOWN AND KEEP HIM IN THE SITTING ROOM UNTIL I COME
MR
HOLMES HE CONTINUED WHEN THEY HAD GONE I COULD NOT SPEAK BEFORE THE
CONSTABLES BUT I DON'T MIND SAYING IN THE PRESENCE OF DR
WATSON
THAT THIS IS THE BRIGHTEST THING THAT YOU HAVE DONE YET THOUGH IT IS A
MYSTERY TO ME HOW YOU DID IT
YOU HAVE SAVED AN INNOCENT MAN'S LIFE
AND YOU HAVE PREVENTED A VERY GRAVE SCANDAL WHICH WOULD HAVE RUINED MY
REPUTATION IN THE FORCE
HOLMES SMILED AND CLAPPED LESTRADE UPON THE SHOULDER
INSTEAD OF BEING RUINED MY GOOD SIR YOU WILL FIND THAT YOUR
REPUTATION HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY ENHANCED
JUST MAKE A FEW ALTERATIONS IN
THAT REPORT WHICH YOU WERE WRITING AND THEY WILL UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT
IS TO THROW DUST IN THE EYES OF INSPECTOR LESTRADE
AND YOU DON'T WANT YOUR NAME TO APPEAR
NOT AT ALL
THE WORK IS ITS OWN REWARD
PERHAPS I SHALL GET THE CREDIT
ALSO AT SOME DISTANT DAY WHEN I PERMIT MY ZEALOUS HISTORIAN TO LAY OUT
HIS FOOLSCAP ONCE MORE EH WATSON WELL NOW LET US SEE WHERE THIS RAT
HAS BEEN LURKING
A LATH AND PLASTER PARTITION HAD BEEN RUN ACROSS THE PASSAGE SIX FEET
FROM THE END WITH A DOOR CUNNINGLY CONCEALED IN IT
IT WAS LIT WITHIN
BY SLITS UNDER THE EAVES
A FEW ARTICLES OF FURNITURE AND A SUPPLY OF
FOOD AND WATER WERE WITHIN TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF BOOKS AND PAPERS
THERE'S THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING A BUILDER SAID HOLMES AS WE CAME
OUT
HE WAS ABLE TO FIX UP HIS OWN LITTLE HIDING PLACE WITHOUT ANY
CONFEDERATE SAVE OF COURSE THAT PRECIOUS HOUSEKEEPER OF HIS WHOM I
SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN ADDING TO YOUR BAG LESTRADE
I'LL TAKE YOUR ADVICE
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW OF THIS PLACE MR
HOLMES
I MADE UP MY MIND THAT THE FELLOW WAS IN HIDING IN THE HOUSE
WHEN I
PACED ONE CORRIDOR AND FOUND IT SIX FEET SHORTER THAN THE CORRESPONDING
ONE BELOW IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR WHERE HE WAS
I THOUGHT HE HAD NOT THE
NERVE TO LIE QUIET BEFORE AN ALARM OF FIRE
WE COULD OF COURSE HAVE
GONE IN AND TAKEN HIM BUT IT AMUSED ME TO MAKE HIM REVEAL HIMSELF
BESIDES I OWED YOU A LITTLE MYSTIFICATION LESTRADE FOR YOUR CHAFF IN
THE MORNING
WELL SIR YOU CERTAINLY GOT EQUAL WITH ME ON THAT
BUT HOW IN THE
WORLD DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS IN THE HOUSE AT ALL
THE THUMB MARK LESTRADE
YOU SAID IT WAS FINAL AND SO IT WAS IN A
VERY DIFFERENT SENSE
I KNEW IT HAD NOT BEEN THERE THE DAY BEFORE
I PAY
A GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION TO MATTERS OF DETAIL AS YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED
AND I HAD EXAMINED THE HALL AND WAS SURE THAT THE WALL WAS CLEAR
THEREFORE IT HAD BEEN PUT ON DURING THE NIGHT
BUT HOW
VERY SIMPLY
WHEN THOSE PACKETS WERE SEALED UP JONAS OLDACRE GOT
MCFARLANE TO SECURE ONE OF THE SEALS BY PUTTING HIS THUMB UPON THE SOFT
WAX
IT WOULD BE DONE SO QUICKLY AND SO NATURALLY THAT I DARESAY THE
YOUNG MAN HIMSELF HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF IT
VERY LIKELY IT JUST SO
HAPPENED AND OLDACRE HAD HIMSELF NO NOTION OF THE USE HE WOULD PUT IT
TO
BROODING OVER THE CASE IN THAT DEN OF HIS IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM
WHAT ABSOLUTELY DAMNING EVIDENCE HE COULD MAKE AGAINST MCFARLANE BY
USING THAT THUMB MARK
IT WAS THE SIMPLEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR HIM TO
TAKE A WAX IMPRESSION FROM THE SEAL TO MOISTEN IT IN AS MUCH BLOOD AS
HE COULD GET FROM A PIN PRICK AND TO PUT THE MARK UPON THE WALL DURING
THE NIGHT EITHER WITH HIS OWN HAND OR WITH THAT OF HIS HOUSEKEEPER
IF YOU EXAMINE AMONG THOSE DOCUMENTS WHICH HE TOOK WITH HIM INTO
HIS RETREAT I WILL LAY YOU A WAGER THAT YOU FIND THE SEAL WITH THE
THUMB MARK UPON IT
WONDERFUL SAID LESTRADE
WONDERFUL IT'S ALL AS CLEAR AS CRYSTAL AS
YOU PUT IT
BUT WHAT IS THE OBJECT OF THIS DEEP DECEPTION MR
HOLMES
IT WAS AMUSING TO ME TO SEE HOW THE DETECTIVE'S OVERBEARING MANNER HAD
CHANGED SUDDENLY TO THAT OF A CHILD ASKING QUESTIONS OF ITS TEACHER
WELL I DON'T THINK THAT IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN
A VERY DEEP
MALICIOUS VINDICTIVE PERSON IS THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS NOW WAITING US
DOWNSTAIRS
YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS ONCE REFUSED BY MCFARLANE'S MOTHER
YOU DON'T I TOLD YOU THAT YOU SHOULD GO TO BLACKHEATH FIRST AND NORWOOD
AFTERWARDS
WELL THIS INJURY AS HE WOULD CONSIDER IT HAS RANKLED
IN HIS WICKED SCHEMING BRAIN AND ALL HIS LIFE HE HAS LONGED FOR
VENGEANCE BUT NEVER SEEN HIS CHANCE
DURING THE LAST YEAR OR TWO
THINGS HAVE GONE AGAINST HIM SECRET SPECULATION I THINK AND HE FINDS
HIMSELF IN A BAD WAY
HE DETERMINES TO SWINDLE HIS CREDITORS AND FOR
THIS PURPOSE HE PAYS LARGE CHECKS TO A CERTAIN MR
CORNELIUS WHO IS I
IMAGINE HIMSELF UNDER ANOTHER NAME
I HAVE NOT TRACED THESE CHECKS
YET BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WERE BANKED UNDER THAT NAME AT SOME
PROVINCIAL TOWN WHERE OLDACRE FROM TIME TO TIME LED A DOUBLE EXISTENCE
HE INTENDED TO CHANGE HIS NAME ALTOGETHER DRAW THIS MONEY AND VANISH
STARTING LIFE AGAIN ELSEWHERE
WELL THAT'S LIKELY ENOUGH
IT WOULD STRIKE HIM THAT IN DISAPPEARING HE MIGHT THROW ALL PURSUIT OFF
HIS TRACK AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE AN AMPLE AND CRUSHING REVENGE UPON
HIS OLD SWEETHEART IF HE COULD GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD BEEN
MURDERED BY HER ONLY CHILD
IT WAS A MASTERPIECE OF VILLAINY AND HE
CARRIED IT OUT LIKE A MASTER
THE IDEA OF THE WILL WHICH WOULD GIVE
AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME THE SECRET VISIT UNKNOWN TO HIS OWN
PARENTS THE RETENTION OF THE STICK THE BLOOD AND THE ANIMAL REMAINS
AND BUTTONS IN THE WOOD PILE ALL WERE ADMIRABLE
IT WAS A NET FROM
WHICH IT SEEMED TO ME A FEW HOURS AGO THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE
ESCAPE
BUT HE HAD NOT THAT SUPREME GIFT OF THE ARTIST THE KNOWLEDGE
OF WHEN TO STOP
HE WISHED TO IMPROVE THAT WHICH WAS ALREADY PERFECT TO
DRAW THE ROPE TIGHTER YET ROUND THE NECK OF HIS UNFORTUNATE VICTIM AND
SO HE RUINED ALL
LET US DESCEND LESTRADE
THERE ARE JUST ONE OR TWO
QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD ASK HIM
THE MALIGNANT CREATURE WAS SEATED IN HIS OWN PARLOUR WITH A POLICEMAN
UPON EACH SIDE OF HIM
IT WAS A JOKE MY GOOD SIR A PRACTICAL JOKE NOTHING MORE HE WHINED
INCESSANTLY
I ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I SIMPLY CONCEALED MYSELF IN ORDER
TO SEE THE EFFECT OF MY DISAPPEARANCE AND I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD NOT
BE SO UNJUST AS TO IMAGINE THAT I WOULD HAVE ALLOWED ANY HARM TO BEFALL
POOR YOUNG MR
MCFARLANE
THAT'S FOR A JURY TO DECIDE SAID LESTRADE
ANYHOW WE SHALL HAVE YOU
ON A CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY IF NOT FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER
AND YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND THAT YOUR CREDITORS WILL IMPOUND THE BANKING
ACCOUNT OF MR
CORNELIUS SAID HOLMES
THE LITTLE MAN STARTED AND TURNED HIS MALIGNANT EYES UPON MY FRIEND
I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR A GOOD DEAL SAID HE
PERHAPS I'LL PAY MY
DEBT SOME DAY
HOLMES SMILED INDULGENTLY
I FANCY THAT FOR SOME FEW YEARS YOU WILL FIND YOUR TIME VERY FULLY
OCCUPIED SAID HE
BY THE WAY WHAT WAS IT YOU PUT INTO THE WOOD PILE
BESIDES YOUR OLD TROUSERS A DEAD DOG OR RABBITS OR WHAT YOU WON'T
TELL DEAR ME HOW VERY UNKIND OF YOU WELL WELL I DARESAY THAT A
COUPLE OF RABBITS WOULD ACCOUNT BOTH FOR THE BLOOD AND FOR THE CHARRED
ASHES
IF EVER YOU WRITE AN ACCOUNT WATSON YOU CAN MAKE RABBITS SERVE
YOUR TURN
THE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN
HOLMES HAD BEEN SEATED FOR SOME HOURS IN SILENCE WITH HIS LONG
THIN BACK CURVED OVER A CHEMICAL VESSEL IN WHICH HE WAS BREWING A
PARTICULARLY MALODOROUS PRODUCT
HIS HEAD WAS SUNK UPON HIS BREAST AND
HE LOOKED FROM MY POINT OF VIEW LIKE A STRANGE LANK BIRD WITH DULL
GRAY PLUMAGE AND A BLACK TOP KNOT
SO WATSON SAID HE SUDDENLY YOU DO NOT PROPOSE TO INVEST IN SOUTH
AFRICAN SECURITIES
I GAVE A START OF ASTONISHMENT
ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO HOLMES'S CURIOUS
FACULTIES THIS SUDDEN INTRUSION INTO MY MOST INTIMATE THOUGHTS WAS
UTTERLY INEXPLICABLE
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU KNOW THAT I ASKED
HE WHEELED ROUND UPON HIS STOOL WITH A STEAMING TEST TUBE IN HIS HAND
AND A GLEAM OF AMUSEMENT IN HIS DEEP SET EYES
NOW WATSON CONFESS YOURSELF UTTERLY TAKEN ABACK SAID HE
I AM
I OUGHT TO MAKE YOU SIGN A PAPER TO THAT EFFECT
WHY
BECAUSE IN FIVE MINUTES YOU WILL SAY THAT IT IS ALL SO ABSURDLY
SIMPLE
I AM SURE THAT I SHALL SAY NOTHING OF THE KIND
YOU SEE MY DEAR WATSON HE PROPPED HIS TEST TUBE IN THE RACK AND
BEGAN TO LECTURE WITH THE AIR OF A PROFESSOR ADDRESSING HIS CLASS IT
IS NOT REALLY DIFFICULT TO CONSTRUCT A SERIES OF INFERENCES EACH
DEPENDENT UPON ITS PREDECESSOR AND EACH SIMPLE IN ITSELF
IF AFTER
DOING SO ONE SIMPLY KNOCKS OUT ALL THE CENTRAL INFERENCES AND PRESENTS
ONE'S AUDIENCE WITH THE STARTING POINT AND THE CONCLUSION ONE MAY
PRODUCE A STARTLING THOUGH POSSIBLY A MERETRICIOUS EFFECT
NOW IT WAS
NOT REALLY DIFFICULT BY AN INSPECTION OF THE GROOVE BETWEEN YOUR LEFT
FOREFINGER AND THUMB TO FEEL SURE THAT YOU DID NOT PROPOSE TO INVEST
YOUR SMALL CAPITAL IN THE GOLD FIELDS
I SEE NO CONNECTION
VERY LIKELY NOT BUT I CAN QUICKLY SHOW YOU A CLOSE CONNECTION
HERE
ARE THE MISSING LINKS OF THE VERY SIMPLE CHAIN 1
YOU HAD CHALK BETWEEN
YOUR LEFT FINGER AND THUMB WHEN YOU RETURNED FROM THE CLUB LAST NIGHT
2
YOU PUT CHALK THERE WHEN YOU PLAY BILLIARDS TO STEADY THE CUE
3
YOU NEVER PLAY BILLIARDS EXCEPT WITH THURSTON
4
YOU TOLD ME FOUR
WEEKS AGO THAT THURSTON HAD AN OPTION ON SOME SOUTH AFRICAN PROPERTY
WHICH WOULD EXPIRE IN A MONTH AND WHICH HE DESIRED YOU TO SHARE WITH
HIM
5
YOUR CHECK BOOK IS LOCKED IN MY DRAWER AND YOU HAVE NOT ASKED
FOR THE KEY
6
YOU DO NOT PROPOSE TO INVEST YOUR MONEY IN THIS MANNER
HOW ABSURDLY SIMPLE I CRIED
QUITE SO SAID HE A LITTLE NETTLED
EVERY PROBLEM BECOMES VERY
CHILDISH WHEN ONCE IT IS EXPLAINED TO YOU
HERE IS AN UNEXPLAINED ONE
SEE WHAT YOU CAN MAKE OF THAT FRIEND WATSON HE TOSSED A SHEET OF
PAPER UPON THE TABLE AND TURNED ONCE MORE TO HIS CHEMICAL ANALYSIS
I LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE ABSURD HIEROGLYPHICS UPON THE PAPER
WHY HOLMES IT IS A CHILD'S DRAWING I CRIED
OH THAT'S YOUR IDEA
WHAT ELSE SHOULD IT BE
THAT IS WHAT MR
HILTON CUBITT OF RIDING THORPE MANOR NORFOLK IS
VERY ANXIOUS TO KNOW
THIS LITTLE CONUNDRUM CAME BY THE FIRST POST AND
HE WAS TO FOLLOW BY THE NEXT TRAIN
THERE'S A RING AT THE BELL WATSON
I SHOULD NOT BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED IF THIS WERE HE
A HEAVY STEP WAS HEARD UPON THE STAIRS AND AN INSTANT LATER THERE
ENTERED A TALL RUDDY CLEAN SHAVEN GENTLEMAN WHOSE CLEAR EYES AND
FLORID CHEEKS TOLD OF A LIFE LED FAR FROM THE FOGS OF BAKER STREET
HE
SEEMED TO BRING A WHIFF OF HIS STRONG FRESH BRACING EAST COAST AIR
WITH HIM AS HE ENTERED
HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH EACH OF US HE WAS
ABOUT TO SIT DOWN WHEN HIS EYE RESTED UPON THE PAPER WITH THE CURIOUS
MARKINGS WHICH I HAD JUST EXAMINED AND LEFT UPON THE TABLE
WELL MR
HOLMES WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE HE CRIED
THEY TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE FOND OF QUEER MYSTERIES AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN FIND A
QUEERER ONE THAN THAT
I SENT THE PAPER ON AHEAD SO THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE
TIME TO STUDY IT BEFORE I CAME
IT IS CERTAINLY RATHER A CURIOUS PRODUCTION SAID HOLMES
AT FIRST
SIGHT IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE SOME CHILDISH PRANK
IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER
OF ABSURD LITTLE FIGURES DANCING ACROSS THE PAPER UPON WHICH THEY
ARE DRAWN
WHY SHOULD YOU ATTRIBUTE ANY IMPORTANCE TO SO GROTESQUE AN
OBJECT
I NEVER SHOULD MR
HOLMES
BUT MY WIFE DOES
IT IS FRIGHTENING HER TO
DEATH
SHE SAYS NOTHING BUT I CAN SEE TERROR IN HER EYES
THAT'S WHY I
WANT TO SIFT THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM
HOLMES HELD UP THE PAPER SO THAT THE SUNLIGHT SHONE FULL UPON IT
IT WAS
A PAGE TORN FROM A NOTEBOOK
THE MARKINGS WERE DONE IN PENCIL AND RAN
IN THIS WAY
GRAPHIC
HOLMES EXAMINED IT FOR SOME TIME AND THEN FOLDING IT CAREFULLY UP HE
PLACED IT IN HIS POCKETBOOK
THIS PROMISES TO BE A MOST INTERESTING AND UNUSUAL CASE SAID HE
YOU GAVE ME A FEW PARTICULARS IN YOUR LETTER MR
HILTON CUBITT BUT I
SHOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD KINDLY GO OVER IT ALL AGAIN FOR
THE BENEFIT OF MY FRIEND DR
WATSON
I'M NOT MUCH OF A STORY TELLER SAID OUR VISITOR NERVOUSLY CLASPING
AND UNCLASPING HIS GREAT STRONG HANDS
YOU'LL JUST ASK ME ANYTHING
THAT I DON'T MAKE CLEAR
I'LL BEGIN AT THE TIME OF MY MARRIAGE LAST
YEAR BUT I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THAT THOUGH I'M NOT A RICH MAN
MY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AT RIDING THORPE FOR A MATTER OF FIVE CENTURIES AND
THERE IS NO BETTER KNOWN FAMILY IN THE COUNTY OF NORFOLK
LAST YEAR I
CAME UP TO LONDON FOR THE JUBILEE AND I STOPPED AT A BOARDING HOUSE IN
RUSSELL SQUARE BECAUSE PARKER THE VICAR OF OUR PARISH WAS STAYING IN
IT
THERE WAS AN AMERICAN YOUNG LADY THERE PATRICK WAS THE NAME ELSIE
PATRICK
IN SOME WAY WE BECAME FRIENDS UNTIL BEFORE MY MONTH WAS UP
I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS MAN COULD BE
WE WERE QUIETLY MARRIED AT A
REGISTRY OFFICE AND WE RETURNED TO NORFOLK A WEDDED COUPLE
YOU'LL
THINK IT VERY MAD MR
HOLMES THAT A MAN OF A GOOD OLD FAMILY SHOULD
MARRY A WIFE IN THIS FASHION KNOWING NOTHING OF HER PAST OR OF
HER PEOPLE BUT IF YOU SAW HER AND KNEW HER IT WOULD HELP YOU TO
UNDERSTAND
SHE WAS VERY STRAIGHT ABOUT IT WAS ELSIE
I CAN'T SAY THAT SHE DID NOT
GIVE ME EVERY CHANCE OF GETTING OUT OF IT IF I WISHED TO DO SO
'I HAVE
HAD SOME VERY DISAGREEABLE ASSOCIATIONS IN MY LIFE SAID SHE 'I WISH
TO FORGET ALL ABOUT THEM
I WOULD RATHER NEVER ALLUDE TO THE PAST FOR
IT IS VERY PAINFUL TO ME
IF YOU TAKE ME HILTON YOU WILL TAKE A WOMAN
WHO HAS NOTHING THAT SHE NEED BE PERSONALLY ASHAMED OF BUT YOU WILL
HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH MY WORD FOR IT AND TO ALLOW ME TO BE SILENT
AS TO ALL THAT PASSED UP TO THE TIME WHEN I BECAME YOURS
IF THESE
CONDITIONS ARE TOO HARD THEN GO BACK TO NORFOLK AND LEAVE ME TO THE
LONELY LIFE IN WHICH YOU FOUND ME IT WAS ONLY THE DAY BEFORE OUR
WEDDING THAT SHE SAID THOSE VERY WORDS TO ME
I TOLD HER THAT I WAS
CONTENT TO TAKE HER ON HER OWN TERMS AND I HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS MY
WORD
WELL WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED NOW FOR A YEAR AND VERY HAPPY WE HAVE BEEN
BUT ABOUT A MONTH AGO AT THE END OF JUNE I SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME
SIGNS OF TROUBLE
ONE DAY MY WIFE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM AMERICA
I SAW
THE AMERICAN STAMP
SHE TURNED DEADLY WHITE READ THE LETTER AND THREW
IT INTO THE FIRE
SHE MADE NO ALLUSION TO IT AFTERWARDS AND I MADE
NONE FOR A PROMISE IS A PROMISE BUT SHE HAS NEVER KNOWN AN EASY HOUR
FROM THAT MOMENT
THERE IS ALWAYS A LOOK OF FEAR UPON HER FACE A LOOK
AS IF SHE WERE WAITING AND EXPECTING
SHE WOULD DO BETTER TO TRUST ME
SHE WOULD FIND THAT I WAS HER BEST FRIEND
BUT UNTIL SHE SPEAKS I CAN
SAY NOTHING
MIND YOU SHE IS A TRUTHFUL WOMAN MR
HOLMES AND WHATEVER
TROUBLE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN IN HER PAST LIFE IT HAS BEEN NO FAULT OF
HERS
I AM ONLY A SIMPLE NORFOLK SQUIRE BUT THERE IS NOT A MAN IN
ENGLAND WHO RANKS HIS FAMILY HONOUR MORE HIGHLY THAN I DO
SHE KNOWS IT
WELL AND SHE KNEW IT WELL BEFORE SHE MARRIED ME
SHE WOULD NEVER BRING
ANY STAIN UPON IT OF THAT I AM SURE
WELL NOW I COME TO THE QUEER PART OF MY STORY
ABOUT A WEEK AGO IT
WAS THE TUESDAY OF LAST WEEK I FOUND ON ONE OF THE WINDOW SILLS A
NUMBER OF ABSURD LITTLE DANCING FIGURES LIKE THESE UPON THE PAPER
THEY
WERE SCRAWLED WITH CHALK
I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE STABLE BOY WHO HAD
DRAWN THEM BUT THE LAD SWORE HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT
ANYHOW THEY HAD
COME THERE DURING THE NIGHT
I HAD THEM WASHED OUT AND I ONLY MENTIONED
THE MATTER TO MY WIFE AFTERWARDS
TO MY SURPRISE SHE TOOK IT VERY
SERIOUSLY AND BEGGED ME IF ANY MORE CAME TO LET HER SEE THEM
NONE DID
COME FOR A WEEK AND THEN YESTERDAY MORNING I FOUND THIS PAPER LYING ON
THE SUNDIAL IN THE GARDEN
I SHOWED IT TO ELSIE AND DOWN SHE DROPPED
IN A DEAD FAINT
SINCE THEN SHE HAS LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN IN A DREAM HALF
DAZED AND WITH TERROR ALWAYS LURKING IN HER EYES
IT WAS THEN THAT I
WROTE AND SENT THE PAPER TO YOU MR
HOLMES
IT WAS NOT A THING THAT
I COULD TAKE TO THE POLICE FOR THEY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT ME BUT YOU
WILL TELL ME WHAT TO DO
I AM NOT A RICH MAN BUT IF THERE IS ANY DANGER
THREATENING MY LITTLE WOMAN I WOULD SPEND MY LAST COPPER TO SHIELD
HER
HE WAS A FINE CREATURE THIS MAN OF THE OLD ENGLISH SOIL SIMPLE
STRAIGHT AND GENTLE WITH HIS GREAT EARNEST BLUE EYES AND BROAD
COMELY FACE
HIS LOVE FOR HIS WIFE AND HIS TRUST IN HER SHONE IN HIS
FEATURES
HOLMES HAD LISTENED TO HIS STORY WITH THE UTMOST ATTENTION
AND NOW HE SAT FOR SOME TIME IN SILENT THOUGHT
DON'T YOU THINK MR
CUBITT SAID HE AT LAST THAT YOUR BEST PLAN
WOULD BE TO MAKE A DIRECT APPEAL TO YOUR WIFE AND TO ASK HER TO SHARE
HER SECRET WITH YOU
HILTON CUBITT SHOOK HIS MASSIVE HEAD
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE MR
HOLMES
IF ELSIE WISHED TO TELL ME SHE
WOULD
IF NOT IT IS NOT FOR ME TO FORCE HER CONFIDENCE
BUT I AM
JUSTIFIED IN TAKING MY OWN LINE AND I WILL
THEN I WILL HELP YOU WITH ALL MY HEART
IN THE FIRST PLACE HAVE YOU
HEARD OF ANY STRANGERS BEING SEEN IN YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD
NO
I PRESUME THAT IT IS A VERY QUIET PLACE
ANY FRESH FACE WOULD CAUSE
COMMENT
IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD YES
BUT WE HAVE SEVERAL SMALL
WATERING PLACES NOT VERY FAR AWAY
AND THE FARMERS TAKE IN LODGERS
THESE HIEROGLYPHICS HAVE EVIDENTLY A MEANING
IF IT IS A PURELY
ARBITRARY ONE IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SOLVE IT
IF ON THE OTHER
HAND IT IS SYSTEMATIC I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE SHALL GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF IT
BUT THIS PARTICULAR SAMPLE IS SO SHORT THAT I CAN DO NOTHING AND
THE FACTS WHICH YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME ARE SO INDEFINITE THAT WE HAVE NO
BASIS FOR AN INVESTIGATION
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU RETURN TO NORFOLK
THAT YOU KEEP A KEEN LOOKOUT AND THAT YOU TAKE AN EXACT COPY OF ANY
FRESH DANCING MEN WHICH MAY APPEAR
IT IS A THOUSAND PITIES THAT WE
HAVE NOT A REPRODUCTION OF THOSE WHICH WERE DONE IN CHALK UPON THE
WINDOW SILL
MAKE A DISCREET INQUIRY ALSO AS TO ANY STRANGERS IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD
WHEN YOU HAVE COLLECTED SOME FRESH EVIDENCE COME TO ME
AGAIN
THAT IS THE BEST ADVICE WHICH I CAN GIVE YOU MR
HILTON CUBITT
IF THERE ARE ANY PRESSING FRESH DEVELOPMENTS I SHALL BE ALWAYS READY TO
RUN DOWN AND SEE YOU IN YOUR NORFOLK HOME
THE INTERVIEW LEFT SHERLOCK HOLMES VERY THOUGHTFUL AND SEVERAL TIMES IN
THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SAW HIM TAKE HIS SLIP OF PAPER FROM HIS NOTEBOOK
AND LOOK LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE CURIOUS FIGURES INSCRIBED UPON IT
HE
MADE NO ALLUSION TO THE AFFAIR HOWEVER UNTIL ONE AFTERNOON A FORTNIGHT
OR SO LATER
I WAS GOING OUT WHEN HE CALLED ME BACK
YOU HAD BETTER STAY HERE WATSON
WHY
BECAUSE I HAD A WIRE FROM HILTON CUBITT THIS MORNING
YOU REMEMBER
HILTON CUBITT OF THE DANCING MEN HE WAS TO REACH LIVERPOOL STREET AT
ONE TWENTY
HE MAY BE HERE AT ANY MOMENT
I GATHER FROM HIS WIRE THAT
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME NEW INCIDENTS OF IMPORTANCE
WE HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT FOR OUR NORFOLK SQUIRE CAME STRAIGHT FROM THE
STATION AS FAST AS A HANSOM COULD BRING HIM
HE WAS LOOKING WORRIED AND
DEPRESSED WITH TIRED EYES AND A LINED FOREHEAD
IT'S GETTING ON MY NERVES THIS BUSINESS MR
HOLMES SAID HE AS HE
SANK LIKE A WEARIED MAN INTO AN ARMCHAIR
IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO FEEL
THAT YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY UNSEEN UNKNOWN FOLK WHO HAVE SOME KIND OF
DESIGN UPON YOU BUT WHEN IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT IS JUST
KILLING YOUR WIFE BY INCHES THEN IT BECOMES AS MUCH AS FLESH AND BLOOD
CAN ENDURE
SHE'S WEARING AWAY UNDER IT JUST WEARING AWAY BEFORE MY
EYES
HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING YET
NO MR
HOLMES SHE HAS NOT
AND YET THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THE
POOR GIRL HAS WANTED TO SPEAK AND YET COULD NOT QUITE BRING HERSELF
TO TAKE THE PLUNGE
I HAVE TRIED TO HELP HER BUT I DARESAY I DID IT
CLUMSILY AND SCARED HER FROM IT
SHE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT MY OLD FAMILY
AND OUR REPUTATION IN THE COUNTY AND OUR PRIDE IN OUR UNSULLIED HONOUR
AND I ALWAYS FELT IT WAS LEADING TO THE POINT BUT SOMEHOW IT TURNED OFF
BEFORE WE GOT THERE
BUT YOU HAVE FOUND OUT SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF
A GOOD DEAL MR
HOLMES
I HAVE SEVERAL FRESH DANCING MEN PICTURES FOR
YOU TO EXAMINE AND WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT I HAVE SEEN THE FELLOW
WHAT THE MAN WHO DRAWS THEM
YES I SAW HIM AT HIS WORK
BUT I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING IN ORDER
WHEN I GOT BACK AFTER MY VISIT TO YOU THE VERY FIRST THING I SAW NEXT
MORNING WAS A FRESH CROP OF DANCING MEN
THEY HAD BEEN DRAWN IN CHALK
UPON THE BLACK WOODEN DOOR OF THE TOOL HOUSE WHICH STANDS BESIDE THE
LAWN IN FULL VIEW OF THE FRONT WINDOWS
I TOOK AN EXACT COPY AND HERE
IT IS HE UNFOLDED A PAPER AND LAID IT UPON THE TABLE
HERE IS A COPY
OF THE HIEROGLYPHICS
GRAPHIC
EXCELLENT SAID HOLMES
EXCELLENT PRAY CONTINUE
WHEN I HAD TAKEN THE COPY I RUBBED OUT THE MARKS BUT TWO MORNINGS
LATER A FRESH INSCRIPTION HAD APPEARED
I HAVE A COPY OF IT HERE
GRAPHIC
HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS AND CHUCKLED WITH DELIGHT
OUR MATERIAL IS RAPIDLY ACCUMULATING SAID HE
THREE DAYS LATER A MESSAGE WAS LEFT SCRAWLED UPON PAPER AND PLACED
UNDER A PEBBLE UPON THE SUNDIAL
HERE IT IS
THE CHARACTERS ARE AS YOU
SEE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE LAST ONE
AFTER THAT I DETERMINED TO LIE IN
WAIT SO I GOT OUT MY REVOLVER AND I SAT UP IN MY STUDY WHICH OVERLOOKS
THE LAWN AND GARDEN
ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING I WAS SEATED BY THE
WINDOW ALL BEING DARK SAVE FOR THE MOONLIGHT OUTSIDE WHEN I HEARD
STEPS BEHIND ME AND THERE WAS MY WIFE IN HER DRESSING GOWN
SHE
IMPLORED ME TO COME TO BED
I TOLD HER FRANKLY THAT I WISHED TO SEE WHO
IT WAS WHO PLAYED SUCH ABSURD TRICKS UPON US
SHE ANSWERED THAT IT WAS
SOME SENSELESS PRACTICAL JOKE AND THAT I SHOULD NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF
IT
'IF IT REALLY ANNOYS YOU HILTON WE MIGHT GO AND TRAVEL YOU AND I
AND SO AVOID THIS NUISANCE
'WHAT BE DRIVEN OUT OF OUR OWN HOUSE BY A PRACTICAL JOKER SAID I
'WHY WE SHOULD HAVE THE WHOLE COUNTY LAUGHING AT US
'WELL COME TO BED SAID SHE 'AND WE CAN DISCUSS IT IN THE MORNING
SUDDENLY AS SHE SPOKE I SAW HER WHITE FACE GROW WHITER YET IN THE
MOONLIGHT AND HER HAND TIGHTENED UPON MY SHOULDER
SOMETHING WAS MOVING
IN THE SHADOW OF THE TOOL HOUSE
I SAW A DARK CREEPING FIGURE WHICH
CRAWLED ROUND THE CORNER AND SQUATTED IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
SEIZING MY
PISTOL I WAS RUSHING OUT WHEN MY WIFE THREW HER ARMS ROUND ME AND HELD
ME WITH CONVULSIVE STRENGTH
I TRIED TO THROW HER OFF BUT SHE CLUNG TO
ME MOST DESPERATELY
AT LAST I GOT CLEAR BUT BY THE TIME I HAD OPENED
THE DOOR AND REACHED THE HOUSE THE CREATURE WAS GONE
HE HAD LEFT A
TRACE OF HIS PRESENCE HOWEVER FOR THERE ON THE DOOR WAS THE VERY SAME
ARRANGEMENT OF DANCING MEN WHICH HAD ALREADY TWICE APPEARED AND WHICH
I HAVE COPIED ON THAT PAPER
THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGN OF THE FELLOW
ANYWHERE THOUGH I RAN ALL OVER THE GROUNDS
AND YET THE AMAZING THING
IS THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE ALL THE TIME FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE
DOOR AGAIN IN THE MORNING HE HAD SCRAWLED SOME MORE OF HIS PICTURES
UNDER THE LINE WHICH I HAD ALREADY SEEN
HAVE YOU THAT FRESH DRAWING
YES IT IS VERY SHORT BUT I MADE A COPY OF IT AND HERE IT IS
AGAIN HE PRODUCED A PAPER
THE NEW DANCE WAS IN THIS FORM
GRAPHIC
TELL ME SAID HOLMES AND I COULD SEE BY HIS EYES THAT HE WAS MUCH
EXCITED WAS THIS A MERE ADDITION TO THE FIRST OR DID IT APPEAR TO BE
ENTIRELY SEPARATE
IT WAS ON A DIFFERENT PANEL OF THE DOOR
EXCELLENT THIS IS FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL FOR OUR PURPOSE
IT
FILLS ME WITH HOPES
NOW MR
HILTON CUBITT PLEASE CONTINUE YOUR MOST
INTERESTING STATEMENT
I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY MR
HOLMES EXCEPT THAT I WAS ANGRY WITH
MY WIFE THAT NIGHT FOR HAVING HELD ME BACK WHEN I MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT THE
SKULKING RASCAL
SHE SAID THAT SHE FEARED THAT I MIGHT COME TO HARM
FOR
AN INSTANT IT HAD CROSSED MY MIND THAT PERHAPS WHAT SHE REALLY FEARED
WAS THAT HE MIGHT COME TO HARM FOR I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT SHE KNEW WHO
THIS MAN WAS AND WHAT HE MEANT BY THESE STRANGE SIGNALS
BUT THERE IS A
TONE IN MY WIFE'S VOICE MR
HOLMES AND A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH FORBID
DOUBT AND I AM SURE THAT IT WAS INDEED MY OWN SAFETY THAT WAS IN HER
MIND
THERE'S THE WHOLE CASE AND NOW I WANT YOUR ADVICE AS TO WHAT I
OUGHT TO DO
MY OWN INCLINATION IS TO PUT HALF A DOZEN OF MY FARM LADS
IN THE SHRUBBERY AND WHEN THIS FELLOW COMES AGAIN TO GIVE HIM SUCH A
HIDING THAT HE WILL LEAVE US IN PEACE FOR THE FUTURE
I FEAR IT IS TOO DEEP A CASE FOR SUCH SIMPLE REMEDIES SAID HOLMES
HOW LONG CAN YOU STAY IN LONDON
I MUST GO BACK TO DAY
I WOULD NOT LEAVE MY WIFE ALONE ALL NIGHT FOR
ANYTHING
SHE IS VERY NERVOUS AND BEGGED ME TO COME BACK
I DARESAY YOU ARE RIGHT
BUT IF YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED I MIGHT
POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETURN WITH YOU IN A DAY OR TWO
MEANWHILE
YOU WILL LEAVE ME THESE PAPERS AND I THINK THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT
I SHALL BE ABLE TO PAY YOU A VISIT SHORTLY AND TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON
YOUR CASE
SHERLOCK HOLMES PRESERVED HIS CALM PROFESSIONAL MANNER UNTIL OUR VISITOR
HAD LEFT US ALTHOUGH IT WAS EASY FOR ME WHO KNEW HIM SO WELL TO SEE
THAT HE WAS PROFOUNDLY EXCITED
THE MOMENT THAT HILTON CUBITT'S BROAD
BACK HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE DOOR MY COMRADE RUSHED TO THE TABLE
LAID OUT ALL THE SLIPS OF PAPER CONTAINING DANCING MEN IN FRONT OF HIM
AND THREW HIMSELF INTO AN INTRICATE AND ELABORATE CALCULATION
FOR
TWO HOURS I WATCHED HIM AS HE COVERED SHEET AFTER SHEET OF PAPER WITH
FIGURES AND LETTERS SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HIS TASK THAT HE HAD
EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN MY PRESENCE
SOMETIMES HE WAS MAKING PROGRESS AND
WHISTLED AND SANG AT HIS WORK SOMETIMES HE WAS PUZZLED AND WOULD SIT
FOR LONG SPELLS WITH A FURROWED BROW AND A VACANT EYE
FINALLY HE SPRANG
FROM HIS CHAIR WITH A CRY OF SATISFACTION AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE
ROOM RUBBING HIS HANDS TOGETHER
THEN HE WROTE A LONG TELEGRAM UPON A
CABLE FORM
IF MY ANSWER TO THIS IS AS I HOPE YOU WILL HAVE A VERY
PRETTY CASE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION WATSON SAID HE
I EXPECT THAT
WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GO DOWN TO NORFOLK TOMORROW AND TO TAKE OUR FRIEND
SOME VERY DEFINITE NEWS AS TO THE SECRET OF HIS ANNOYANCE
I CONFESS THAT I WAS FILLED WITH CURIOSITY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT HOLMES
LIKED TO MAKE HIS DISCLOSURES AT HIS OWN TIME AND IN HIS OWN WAY SO I
WAITED UNTIL IT SHOULD SUIT HIM TO TAKE ME INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
BUT THERE WAS A DELAY IN THAT ANSWERING TELEGRAM AND TWO DAYS OF
IMPATIENCE FOLLOWED DURING WHICH HOLMES PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT EVERY
RING OF THE BELL
ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND THERE CAME A LETTER FROM
HILTON CUBITT
ALL WAS QUIET WITH HIM SAVE THAT A LONG INSCRIPTION HAD
APPEARED THAT MORNING UPON THE PEDESTAL OF THE SUNDIAL
HE INCLOSED A
COPY OF IT WHICH IS HERE REPRODUCED
GRAPHIC
HOLMES BENT OVER THIS GROTESQUE FRIEZE FOR SOME MINUTES AND THEN
SUDDENLY SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF SURPRISE AND DISMAY
HIS FACE WAS HAGGARD WITH ANXIETY
WE HAVE LET THIS AFFAIR GO FAR ENOUGH SAID HE
IS THERE A TRAIN TO
NORTH WALSHAM TO NIGHT
I TURNED UP THE TIME TABLE
THE LAST HAD JUST GONE
THEN WE SHALL BREAKFAST EARLY AND TAKE THE VERY FIRST IN THE MORNING
SAID HOLMES
OUR PRESENCE IS MOST URGENTLY NEEDED
AH HERE IS OUR
EXPECTED CABLEGRAM
ONE MOMENT MRS
HUDSON THERE MAY BE AN ANSWER
NO
THAT IS QUITE AS I EXPECTED
THIS MESSAGE MAKES IT EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL
THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOSE AN HOUR IN LETTING HILTON CUBITT KNOW HOW
MATTERS STAND FOR IT IS A SINGULAR AND A DANGEROUS WEB IN WHICH OUR
SIMPLE NORFOLK SQUIRE IS ENTANGLED
SO INDEED IT PROVED AND AS I COME TO THE DARK CONCLUSION OF A STORY
WHICH HAD SEEMED TO ME TO BE ONLY CHILDISH AND BIZARRE I EXPERIENCE
ONCE AGAIN THE DISMAY AND HORROR WITH WHICH I WAS FILLED
WOULD THAT I
HAD SOME BRIGHTER ENDING TO COMMUNICATE TO MY READERS BUT THESE ARE THE
CHRONICLES OF FACT AND I MUST FOLLOW TO THEIR DARK CRISIS THE STRANGE
CHAIN OF EVENTS WHICH FOR SOME DAYS MADE RIDING THORPE MANOR A HOUSEHOLD
WORD THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF ENGLAND
WE HAD HARDLY ALIGHTED AT NORTH WALSHAM AND MENTIONED THE NAME OF OUR
DESTINATION WHEN THE STATION MASTER HURRIED TOWARDS US
I SUPPOSE THAT
YOU ARE THE DETECTIVES FROM LONDON SAID HE
A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE PASSED OVER HOLMES'S FACE
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SUCH A THING
BECAUSE INSPECTOR MARTIN FROM NORWICH HAS JUST PASSED THROUGH
BUT
MAYBE YOU ARE THE SURGEONS
SHE'S NOT DEAD OR WASN'T BY LAST ACCOUNTS
YOU MAY BE IN TIME TO SAVE HER YET THOUGH IT BE FOR THE GALLOWS
HOLMES'S BROW WAS DARK WITH ANXIETY
WE ARE GOING TO RIDING THORPE MANOR SAID HE BUT WE HAVE HEARD
NOTHING OF WHAT HAS PASSED THERE
IT'S A TERRIBLE BUSINESS SAID THE STATIONMASTER
THEY ARE SHOT BOTH
MR
HILTON CUBITT AND HIS WIFE
SHE SHOT HIM AND THEN HERSELF SO THE
SERVANTS SAY
HE'S DEAD AND HER LIFE IS DESPAIRED OF
DEAR DEAR ONE
OF THE OLDEST FAMILIES IN THE COUNTY OF NORFOLK AND ONE OF THE MOST
HONOURED
WITHOUT A WORD HOLMES HURRIED TO A CARRIAGE AND DURING THE LONG SEVEN
MILES' DRIVE HE NEVER OPENED HIS MOUTH
SELDOM HAVE I SEEN HIM SO
UTTERLY DESPONDENT
HE HAD BEEN UNEASY DURING ALL OUR JOURNEY FROM
TOWN AND I HAD OBSERVED THAT HE HAD TURNED OVER THE MORNING PAPERS WITH
ANXIOUS ATTENTION BUT NOW THIS SUDDEN REALIZATION OF HIS WORST FEARS
LEFT HIM IN A BLANK MELANCHOLY
HE LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT LOST IN
GLOOMY SPECULATION
YET THERE WAS MUCH AROUND TO INTEREST US FOR WE
WERE PASSING THROUGH AS SINGULAR A COUNTRYSIDE AS ANY IN ENGLAND WHERE
A FEW SCATTERED COTTAGES REPRESENTED THE POPULATION OF TO DAY WHILE ON
EVERY HAND ENORMOUS SQUARE TOWERED CHURCHES BRISTLED UP FROM THE FLAT
GREEN LANDSCAPE AND TOLD OF THE GLORY AND PROSPERITY OF OLD EAST ANGLIA
AT LAST THE VIOLET RIM OF THE GERMAN OCEAN APPEARED OVER THE GREEN EDGE
OF THE NORFOLK COAST AND THE DRIVER POINTED WITH HIS WHIP TO TWO OLD
BRICK AND TIMBER GABLES WHICH PROJECTED FROM A GROVE OF TREES
THAT'S
RIDING THORPE MANOR SAID HE
AS WE DROVE UP TO THE PORTICOED FRONT DOOR I OBSERVED IN FRONT OF IT
BESIDE THE TENNIS LAWN THE BLACK TOOL HOUSE AND THE PEDESTALLED SUNDIAL
WITH WHICH WE HAD SUCH STRANGE ASSOCIATIONS
A DAPPER LITTLE MAN WITH
A QUICK ALERT MANNER AND A WAXED MOUSTACHE HAD JUST DESCENDED FROM A
HIGH DOG CART
HE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AS INSPECTOR MARTIN OF THE NORFOLK
CONSTABULARY AND HE WAS CONSIDERABLY ASTONISHED WHEN HE HEARD THE NAME
OF MY COMPANION
WHY MR
HOLMES THE CRIME WAS ONLY COMMITTED AT THREE THIS MORNING
HOW COULD YOU HEAR OF IT IN LONDON AND GET TO THE SPOT AS SOON AS I
I ANTICIPATED IT
I CAME IN THE HOPE OF PREVENTING IT
THEN YOU MUST HAVE IMPORTANT EVIDENCE OF WHICH WE ARE IGNORANT FOR
THEY WERE SAID TO BE A MOST UNITED COUPLE
I HAVE ONLY THE EVIDENCE OF THE DANCING MEN SAID HOLMES
I WILL
EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO YOU LATER
MEANWHILE SINCE IT IS TOO LATE TO
PREVENT THIS TRAGEDY I AM VERY ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD USE THE KNOWLEDGE
WHICH I POSSESS IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT JUSTICE BE DONE
WILL YOU
ASSOCIATE ME IN YOUR INVESTIGATION OR WILL YOU PREFER THAT I SHOULD ACT
INDEPENDENTLY
I SHOULD BE PROUD TO FEEL THAT WE WERE ACTING TOGETHER MR
HOLMES
SAID THE INSPECTOR EARNESTLY
IN THAT CASE I SHOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THE EVIDENCE AND TO EXAMINE THE
PREMISES WITHOUT AN INSTANT OF UNNECESSARY DELAY
INSPECTOR MARTIN HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO ALLOW MY FRIEND TO DO THINGS
IN HIS OWN FASHION AND CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH CAREFULLY NOTING THE
RESULTS
THE LOCAL SURGEON AN OLD WHITE HAIRED MAN HAD JUST COME DOWN
FROM MRS
HILTON CUBITT'S ROOM AND HE REPORTED THAT HER INJURIES WERE
SERIOUS BUT NOT NECESSARILY FATAL
THE BULLET HAD PASSED THROUGH THE
FRONT OF HER BRAIN AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD
REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS
ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SHE HAD BEEN SHOT OR
HAD SHOT HERSELF HE WOULD NOT VENTURE TO EXPRESS ANY DECIDED OPINION
CERTAINLY THE BULLET HAD BEEN DISCHARGED AT VERY CLOSE QUARTERS
THERE
WAS ONLY THE ONE PISTOL FOUND IN THE ROOM TWO BARRELS OF WHICH HAD
BEEN EMPTIED
MR
HILTON CUBITT HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE HEART
IT WAS
EQUALLY CONCEIVABLE THAT HE HAD SHOT HER AND THEN HIMSELF OR THAT
SHE HAD BEEN THE CRIMINAL FOR THE REVOLVER LAY UPON THE FLOOR MIDWAY
BETWEEN THEM
HAS HE BEEN MOVED ASKED HOLMES
WE HAVE MOVED NOTHING EXCEPT THE LADY
WE COULD NOT LEAVE HER LYING
WOUNDED UPON THE FLOOR
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE DOCTOR
SINCE FOUR O'CLOCK
ANYONE ELSE
YES THE CONSTABLE HERE
AND YOU HAVE TOUCHED NOTHING
NOTHING
YOU HAVE ACTED WITH GREAT DISCRETION
WHO SENT FOR YOU
THE HOUSEMAID SAUNDERS
WAS IT SHE WHO GAVE THE ALARM
SHE AND MRS
KING THE COOK
WHERE ARE THEY NOW
IN THE KITCHEN I BELIEVE
THEN I THINK WE HAD BETTER HEAR THEIR STORY AT ONCE
THE OLD HALL OAK PANELLED AND HIGH WINDOWED HAD BEEN TURNED INTO A
COURT OF INVESTIGATION
HOLMES SAT IN A GREAT OLD FASHIONED CHAIR HIS
INEXORABLE EYES GLEAMING OUT OF HIS HAGGARD FACE
I COULD READ IN THEM
A SET PURPOSE TO DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO THIS QUEST UNTIL THE CLIENT WHOM HE
HAD FAILED TO SAVE SHOULD AT LAST BE AVENGED
THE TRIM INSPECTOR MARTIN
THE OLD GRAY HEADED COUNTRY DOCTOR MYSELF AND A STOLID VILLAGE
POLICEMAN MADE UP THE REST OF THAT STRANGE COMPANY
THE TWO WOMEN TOLD THEIR STORY CLEARLY ENOUGH
THEY HAD BEEN AROUSED
FROM THEIR SLEEP BY THE SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION WHICH HAD BEEN FOLLOWED
A MINUTE LATER BY A SECOND ONE
THEY SLEPT IN ADJOINING ROOMS AND MRS
KING HAD RUSHED IN TO SAUNDERS
TOGETHER THEY HAD DESCENDED THE STAIRS
THE DOOR OF THE STUDY WAS OPEN AND A CANDLE WAS BURNING UPON THE TABLE
THEIR MASTER LAY UPON HIS FACE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
HE WAS QUITE
DEAD
NEAR THE WINDOW HIS WIFE WAS CROUCHING HER HEAD LEANING AGAINST
THE WALL
SHE WAS HORRIBLY WOUNDED AND THE SIDE OF HER FACE WAS RED
WITH BLOOD
SHE BREATHED HEAVILY BUT WAS INCAPABLE OF SAYING ANYTHING
THE PASSAGE AS WELL AS THE ROOM WAS FULL OF SMOKE AND THE SMELL OF
POWDER
THE WINDOW WAS CERTAINLY SHUT AND FASTENED UPON THE INSIDE
BOTH
WOMEN WERE POSITIVE UPON THE POINT
THEY HAD AT ONCE SENT FOR THE
DOCTOR AND FOR THE CONSTABLE
THEN WITH THE AID OF THE GROOM AND THE
STABLE BOY THEY HAD CONVEYED THEIR INJURED MISTRESS TO HER ROOM
BOTH
SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD OCCUPIED THE BED
SHE WAS CLAD IN HER DRESS HE
IN HIS DRESSING GOWN OVER HIS NIGHT CLOTHES
NOTHING HAD BEEN MOVED IN
THE STUDY
SO FAR AS THEY KNEW THERE HAD NEVER BEEN ANY QUARREL BETWEEN
HUSBAND AND WIFE
THEY HAD ALWAYS LOOKED UPON THEM AS A VERY UNITED
COUPLE
THESE WERE THE MAIN POINTS OF THE SERVANTS' EVIDENCE
IN ANSWER TO
INSPECTOR MARTIN THEY WERE CLEAR THAT EVERY DOOR WAS FASTENED UPON THE
INSIDE AND THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE HOUSE
IN ANSWER TO
HOLMES THEY BOTH REMEMBERED THAT THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE SMELL OF
POWDER FROM THE MOMENT THAT THEY RAN OUT OF THEIR ROOMS UPON THE TOP
FLOOR
I COMMEND THAT FACT VERY CAREFULLY TO YOUR ATTENTION SAID
HOLMES TO HIS PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUE
AND NOW I THINK THAT WE ARE IN A
POSITION TO UNDERTAKE A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
THE STUDY PROVED TO BE A SMALL CHAMBER LINED ON THREE SIDES WITH BOOKS
AND WITH A WRITING TABLE FACING AN ORDINARY WINDOW WHICH LOOKED OUT
UPON THE GARDEN
OUR FIRST ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE BODY OF THE
UNFORTUNATE SQUIRE WHOSE HUGE FRAME LAY STRETCHED ACROSS THE ROOM
HIS
DISORDERED DRESS SHOWED THAT HE HAD BEEN HASTILY AROUSED FROM SLEEP
THE BULLET HAD BEEN FIRED AT HIM FROM THE FRONT AND HAD REMAINED IN
HIS BODY AFTER PENETRATING THE HEART
HIS DEATH HAD CERTAINLY BEEN
INSTANTANEOUS AND PAINLESS
THERE WAS NO POWDER MARKING EITHER UPON HIS
DRESSING GOWN OR ON HIS HANDS
ACCORDING TO THE COUNTRY SURGEON THE
LADY HAD STAINS UPON HER FACE BUT NONE UPON HER HAND
THE ABSENCE OF THE LATTER MEANS NOTHING THOUGH ITS PRESENCE MAY
MEAN EVERYTHING SAID HOLMES
UNLESS THE POWDER FROM A BADLY FITTING
CARTRIDGE HAPPENS TO SPURT BACKWARD ONE MAY FIRE MANY SHOTS WITHOUT
LEAVING A SIGN
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT MR
CUBITT'S BODY MAY NOW BE
REMOVED
I SUPPOSE DOCTOR YOU HAVE NOT RECOVERED THE BULLET WHICH
WOUNDED THE LADY
A SERIOUS OPERATION WILL BE NECESSARY BEFORE THAT CAN BE DONE
BUT
THERE ARE STILL FOUR CARTRIDGES IN THE REVOLVER
TWO HAVE BEEN FIRED AND
TWO WOUNDS INFLICTED SO THAT EACH BULLET CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR
SO IT WOULD SEEM SAID HOLMES
PERHAPS YOU CAN ACCOUNT ALSO FOR THE
BULLET WHICH HAS SO OBVIOUSLY STRUCK THE EDGE OF THE WINDOW
HE HAD TURNED SUDDENLY AND HIS LONG THIN FINGER WAS POINTING TO A HOLE
WHICH HAD BEEN DRILLED RIGHT THROUGH THE LOWER WINDOW SASH ABOUT AN
INCH ABOVE THE BOTTOM
BY GEORGE CRIED THE INSPECTOR
HOW EVER DID YOU SEE THAT
BECAUSE I LOOKED FOR IT
WONDERFUL SAID THE COUNTRY DOCTOR
YOU ARE CERTAINLY RIGHT SIR
THEN A THIRD SHOT HAS BEEN FIRED AND THEREFORE A THIRD PERSON MUST HAVE
BEEN PRESENT
BUT WHO COULD THAT HAVE BEEN AND HOW COULD HE HAVE GOT
AWAY
THAT IS THE PROBLEM WHICH WE ARE NOW ABOUT TO SOLVE SAID SHERLOCK
HOLMES
YOU REMEMBER INSPECTOR MARTIN WHEN THE SERVANTS SAID THAT ON
LEAVING THEIR ROOM THEY WERE AT ONCE CONSCIOUS OF A SMELL OF POWDER I
REMARKED THAT THE POINT WAS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE
YES SIR BUT I CONFESS I DID NOT QUITE FOLLOW YOU
IT SUGGESTED THAT AT THE TIME OF THE FIRING THE WINDOW AS WELL AS THE
DOOR OF THE ROOM HAD BEEN OPEN
OTHERWISE THE FUMES OF POWDER COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN BLOWN SO RAPIDLY THROUGH THE HOUSE
A DRAUGHT IN THE ROOM WAS
NECESSARY FOR THAT
BOTH DOOR AND WINDOW WERE ONLY OPEN FOR A VERY SHORT
TIME HOWEVER
HOW DO YOU PROVE THAT
BECAUSE THE CANDLE WAS NOT GUTTERED
CAPITAL CRIED THE INSPECTOR
CAPITAL
FEELING SURE THAT THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN AT THE TIME OF THE TRAGEDY
I CONCEIVED THAT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A THIRD PERSON IN THE AFFAIR WHO
STOOD OUTSIDE THIS OPENING AND FIRED THROUGH IT
ANY SHOT DIRECTED AT
THIS PERSON MIGHT HIT THE SASH
I LOOKED AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS
THE BULLET MARK
BUT HOW CAME THE WINDOW TO BE SHUT AND FASTENED
THE WOMAN'S FIRST INSTINCT WOULD BE TO SHUT AND FASTEN THE WINDOW
BUT
HALLOA WHAT IS THIS
IT WAS A LADY'S HAND BAG WHICH STOOD UPON THE STUDY TABLE A TRIM LITTLE
HANDBAG OF CROCODILE SKIN AND SILVER
HOLMES OPENED IT AND TURNED
THE CONTENTS OUT
THERE WERE TWENTY FIFTY POUND NOTES OF THE BANK OF
ENGLAND HELD TOGETHER BY AN INDIA RUBBER BAND NOTHING ELSE
THIS MUST BE PRESERVED FOR IT WILL FIGURE IN THE TRIAL SAID HOLMES
AS HE HANDED THE BAG WITH ITS CONTENTS TO THE INSPECTOR
IT IS NOW
NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THIS THIRD BULLET
WHICH HAS CLEARLY FROM THE SPLINTERING OF THE WOOD BEEN FIRED FROM
INSIDE THE ROOM
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MRS
KING THE COOK AGAIN
YOU
SAID MRS
KING THAT YOU WERE AWAKENED BY A LOUD EXPLOSION
WHEN YOU
SAID THAT DID YOU MEAN THAT IT SEEMED TO YOU TO BE LOUDER THAN THE
SECOND ONE
WELL SIR IT WAKENED ME FROM MY SLEEP SO IT IS HARD TO JUDGE
BUT IT
DID SEEM VERY LOUD
YOU DON'T THINK THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN TWO SHOTS FIRED ALMOST AT THE
SAME INSTANT
I AM SURE I COULDN'T SAY SIR
I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY SO
I RATHER THINK INSPECTOR MARTIN
THAT WE HAVE NOW EXHAUSTED ALL THAT THIS ROOM CAN TEACH US
IF YOU WILL
KINDLY STEP ROUND WITH ME WE SHALL SEE WHAT FRESH EVIDENCE THE GARDEN
HAS TO OFFER
A FLOWER BED EXTENDED UP TO THE STUDY WINDOW AND WE ALL BROKE INTO AN
EXCLAMATION AS WE APPROACHED IT
THE FLOWERS WERE TRAMPLED DOWN AND THE
SOFT SOIL WAS IMPRINTED ALL OVER WITH FOOTMARKS
LARGE MASCULINE FEET
THEY WERE WITH PECULIARLY LONG SHARP TOES
HOLMES HUNTED ABOUT AMONG
THE GRASS AND LEAVES LIKE A RETRIEVER AFTER A WOUNDED BIRD
THEN WITH
A CRY OF SATISFACTION HE BENT FORWARD AND PICKED UP A LITTLE BRAZEN
CYLINDER
I THOUGHT SO SAID HE THE REVOLVER HAD AN EJECTOR AND HERE IS THE
THIRD CARTRIDGE
I REALLY THINK INSPECTOR MARTIN THAT OUR CASE IS
ALMOST COMPLETE
THE COUNTRY INSPECTOR'S FACE HAD SHOWN HIS INTENSE AMAZEMENT AT THE
RAPID AND MASTERFUL PROGRESS OF HOLMES'S INVESTIGATION
AT FIRST HE
HAD SHOWN SOME DISPOSITION TO ASSERT HIS OWN POSITION BUT NOW HE WAS
OVERCOME WITH ADMIRATION AND READY TO FOLLOW WITHOUT QUESTION WHEREVER
HOLMES LED
WHOM DO YOU SUSPECT HE ASKED
I'LL GO INTO THAT LATER
THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS IN THIS PROBLEM WHICH
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU YET
NOW THAT I HAVE GOT SO FAR
I HAD BEST PROCEED ON MY OWN LINES AND THEN CLEAR THE WHOLE MATTER UP
ONCE AND FOR ALL
JUST AS YOU WISH MR
HOLMES SO LONG AS WE GET OUR MAN
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO MAKE MYSTERIES BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT
OF ACTION TO ENTER INTO LONG AND COMPLEX EXPLANATIONS
I HAVE THE
THREADS OF THIS AFFAIR ALL IN MY HAND
EVEN IF THIS LADY SHOULD NEVER
RECOVER CONSCIOUSNESS WE CAN STILL RECONSTRUCT THE EVENTS OF LAST NIGHT
AND INSURE THAT JUSTICE BE DONE
FIRST OF ALL I WISH TO KNOW WHETHER
THERE IS ANY INN IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD KNOWN AS 'ELRIGE'S'
THE SERVANTS WERE CROSS QUESTIONED BUT NONE OF THEM HAD HEARD OF SUCH A
PLACE
THE STABLE BOY THREW A LIGHT UPON THE MATTER BY REMEMBERING THAT
A FARMER OF THAT NAME LIVED SOME MILES OFF IN THE DIRECTION OF EAST
RUSTON
IS IT A LONELY FARM
VERY LONELY SIR
PERHAPS THEY HAVE NOT HEARD YET OF ALL THAT HAPPENED HERE DURING THE
NIGHT
MAYBE NOT SIR
HOLMES THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE AND THEN A CURIOUS SMILE PLAYED OVER HIS
FACE
SADDLE A HORSE MY LAD SAID HE
I SHALL WISH YOU TO TAKE A NOTE TO
ELRIGE'S FARM
HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE VARIOUS SLIPS OF THE DANCING MEN
WITH THESE
IN FRONT OF HIM HE WORKED FOR SOME TIME AT THE STUDY TABLE
FINALLY HE
HANDED A NOTE TO THE BOY WITH DIRECTIONS TO PUT IT INTO THE HANDS
OF THE PERSON TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED AND ESPECIALLY TO ANSWER NO
QUESTIONS OF ANY SORT WHICH MIGHT BE PUT TO HIM
I SAW THE OUTSIDE OF
THE NOTE ADDRESSED IN STRAGGLING IRREGULAR CHARACTERS VERY UNLIKE
HOLMES'S USUAL PRECISE HAND
IT WAS CONSIGNED TO MR
ABE SLANEY ELRIGES
FARM EAST RUSTON NORFOLK
I THINK INSPECTOR HOLMES REMARKED THAT YOU WOULD DO WELL TO
TELEGRAPH FOR AN ESCORT AS IF MY CALCULATIONS PROVE TO BE CORRECT YOU
MAY HAVE A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS PRISONER TO CONVEY TO THE COUNTY JAIL
THE BOY WHO TAKES THIS NOTE COULD NO DOUBT FORWARD YOUR TELEGRAM
IF
THERE IS AN AFTERNOON TRAIN TO TOWN WATSON I THINK WE SHOULD DO WELL
TO TAKE IT AS I HAVE A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF SOME INTEREST TO FINISH
AND THIS INVESTIGATION DRAWS RAPIDLY TO A CLOSE
WHEN THE YOUTH HAD BEEN DISPATCHED WITH THE NOTE SHERLOCK HOLMES GAVE
HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SERVANTS
IF ANY VISITOR WERE TO CALL ASKING FOR
MRS
HILTON CUBITT NO INFORMATION SHOULD BE GIVEN AS TO HER CONDITION
BUT HE WAS TO BE SHOWN AT ONCE INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
HE IMPRESSED THESE
POINTS UPON THEM WITH THE UTMOST EARNESTNESS
FINALLY HE LED THE WAY
INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WITH THE REMARK THAT THE BUSINESS WAS NOW OUT OF
OUR HANDS AND THAT WE MUST WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS BEST WE MIGHT UNTIL
WE COULD SEE WHAT WAS IN STORE FOR US
THE DOCTOR HAD DEPARTED TO HIS
PATIENTS AND ONLY THE INSPECTOR AND MYSELF REMAINED
I THINK THAT I CAN HELP YOU TO PASS AN HOUR IN AN INTERESTING AND
PROFITABLE MANNER SAID HOLMES DRAWING HIS CHAIR UP TO THE TABLE
AND SPREADING OUT IN FRONT OF HIM THE VARIOUS PAPERS UPON WHICH WERE
RECORDED THE ANTICS OF THE DANCING MEN
AS TO YOU FRIEND WATSON I OWE
YOU EVERY ATONEMENT FOR HAVING ALLOWED YOUR NATURAL CURIOSITY TO REMAIN
SO LONG UNSATISFIED
TO YOU INSPECTOR THE WHOLE INCIDENT MAY APPEAL
AS A REMARKABLE PROFESSIONAL STUDY
I MUST TELL YOU FIRST OF ALL THE
INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE PREVIOUS CONSULTATIONS
WHICH MR
HILTON CUBITT HAS HAD WITH ME IN BAKER STREET HE THEN
SHORTLY RECAPITULATED THE FACTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECORDED
I
HAVE HERE IN FRONT OF ME THESE SINGULAR PRODUCTIONS AT WHICH ONE
MIGHT SMILE HAD THEY NOT PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE THE FORERUNNERS OF
SO TERRIBLE A TRAGEDY
I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL FORMS OF SECRET
WRITINGS AND AM MYSELF THE AUTHOR OF A TRIFLING MONOGRAPH UPON THE
SUBJECT IN WHICH I ANALYZE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEPARATE CIPHERS
BUT I CONFESS THAT THIS IS ENTIRELY NEW TO ME
THE OBJECT OF THOSE WHO
INVENTED THE SYSTEM HAS APPARENTLY BEEN TO CONCEAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS
CONVEY A MESSAGE AND TO GIVE THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE THE MERE RANDOM
SKETCHES OF CHILDREN
HAVING ONCE RECOGNIZED HOWEVER THAT THE SYMBOLS STOOD FOR LETTERS
AND HAVING APPLIED THE RULES WHICH GUIDE US IN ALL FORMS OF SECRET
WRITINGS THE SOLUTION WAS EASY ENOUGH
THE FIRST MESSAGE SUBMITTED TO
ME WAS SO SHORT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO MORE THAN TO SAY
WITH SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYMBOL XXX STOOD FOR E
AS YOU ARE AWARE
E IS THE MOST COMMON LETTER IN THE ENGLISH ALPHABET AND IT PREDOMINATES
TO SO MARKED AN EXTENT THAT EVEN IN A SHORT SENTENCE ONE WOULD EXPECT
TO FIND IT MOST OFTEN
OUT OF FIFTEEN SYMBOLS IN THE FIRST MESSAGE FOUR
WERE THE SAME SO IT WAS REASONABLE TO SET THIS DOWN AS E
IT IS TRUE
THAT IN SOME CASES THE FIGURE WAS BEARING A FLAG AND IN SOME CASES NOT
BUT IT WAS PROBABLE FROM THE WAY IN WHICH THE FLAGS WERE DISTRIBUTED
THAT THEY WERE USED TO BREAK THE SENTENCE UP INTO WORDS
I ACCEPTED THIS
AS A HYPOTHESIS AND NOTED THAT E WAS REPRESENTED BY XXX
BUT NOW CAME THE REAL DIFFICULTY OF THE INQUIRY
THE ORDER OF
THE ENGLISH LETTERS AFTER E IS BY NO MEANS WELL MARKED AND ANY
PREPONDERANCE WHICH MAY BE SHOWN IN AN AVERAGE OF A PRINTED SHEET MAY BE
REVERSED IN A SINGLE SHORT SENTENCE
SPEAKING ROUGHLY T A O I N S
H R D AND L ARE THE NUMERICAL ORDER IN WHICH LETTERS OCCUR BUT T
A O AND I ARE VERY NEARLY ABREAST OF EACH OTHER AND IT WOULD BE AN
ENDLESS TASK TO TRY EACH COMBINATION UNTIL A MEANING WAS ARRIVED AT
I THEREFORE WAITED FOR FRESH MATERIAL
IN MY SECOND INTERVIEW WITH MR
HILTON CUBITT HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME TWO OTHER SHORT SENTENCES AND ONE
MESSAGE WHICH APPEARED SINCE THERE WAS NO FLAG TO BE A SINGLE WORD
HERE ARE THE SYMBOLS
NOW IN THE SINGLE WORD I HAVE ALREADY GOT THE
TWO E'S COMING SECOND AND FOURTH IN A WORD OF FIVE LETTERS
IT MIGHT
BE 'SEVER OR 'LEVER OR 'NEVER THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT
THE LATTER AS A REPLY TO AN APPEAL IS FAR THE MOST PROBABLE AND
THE CIRCUMSTANCES POINTED TO ITS BEING A REPLY WRITTEN BY THE LADY
ACCEPTING IT AS CORRECT WE ARE NOW ABLE TO SAY THAT THE SYMBOLS STAND
RESPECTIVELY FOR N V AND R
EVEN NOW I WAS IN CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY BUT A HAPPY THOUGHT PUT ME
IN POSSESSION OF SEVERAL OTHER LETTERS
IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THESE
APPEALS CAME AS I EXPECTED FROM SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN INTIMATE WITH THE
LADY IN HER EARLY LIFE A COMBINATION WHICH CONTAINED TWO E'S WITH
THREE LETTERS BETWEEN MIGHT VERY WELL STAND FOR THE NAME 'ELSIE ON
EXAMINATION I FOUND THAT SUCH A COMBINATION FORMED THE TERMINATION OF
THE MESSAGE WHICH WAS THREE TIMES REPEATED
IT WAS CERTAINLY SOME APPEAL
TO 'ELSIE IN THIS WAY I HAD GOT MY L S AND I
BUT WHAT APPEAL COULD
IT BE THERE WERE ONLY FOUR LETTERS IN THE WORD WHICH PRECEDED 'ELSIE
AND IT ENDED IN E
SURELY THE WORD MUST BE 'COME I TRIED ALL OTHER
FOUR LETTERS ENDING IN E BUT COULD FIND NONE TO FIT THE CASE
SO NOW I
WAS IN POSSESSION OF C O AND M AND I WAS IN A POSITION TO ATTACK THE
FIRST MESSAGE ONCE MORE DIVIDING IT INTO WORDS AND PUTTING DOTS FOR
EACH SYMBOL WHICH WAS STILL UNKNOWN
SO TREATED IT WORKED OUT IN THIS
FASHION
M ERE E SL NE
NOW THE FIRST LETTER CAN ONLY BE A WHICH IS A MOST USEFUL DISCOVERY
SINCE IT OCCURS NO FEWER THAN THREE TIMES IN THIS SHORT SENTENCE AND
THE H IS ALSO APPARENT IN THE SECOND WORD
NOW IT BECOMES
AM HERE A E SLANE
OR FILLING IN THE OBVIOUS VACANCIES IN THE NAME
AM HERE ABE SLANEY
I HAD SO MANY LETTERS NOW THAT I COULD PROCEED WITH CONSIDERABLE
CONFIDENCE TO THE SECOND MESSAGE WHICH WORKED OUT IN THIS FASHION
A
ELRI
ES
HERE I COULD ONLY MAKE SENSE BY PUTTING T AND G FOR THE MISSING LETTERS
AND SUPPOSING THAT THE NAME WAS THAT OF SOME HOUSE OR INN AT WHICH THE
WRITER WAS STAYING
INSPECTOR MARTIN AND I HAD LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST INTEREST TO THE FULL
AND CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HOW MY FRIEND HAD PRODUCED RESULTS WHICH HAD LED TO
SO COMPLETE A COMMAND OVER OUR DIFFICULTIES
WHAT DID YOU DO THEN SIR ASKED THE INSPECTOR
I HAD EVERY REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS ABE SLANEY WAS AN AMERICAN
SINCE ABE IS AN AMERICAN CONTRACTION AND SINCE A LETTER FROM AMERICA
HAD BEEN THE STARTING POINT OF ALL THE TROUBLE
I HAD ALSO EVERY CAUSE
TO THINK THAT THERE WAS SOME CRIMINAL SECRET IN THE MATTER
THE LADY'S
ALLUSIONS TO HER PAST AND HER REFUSAL TO TAKE HER HUSBAND INTO HER
CONFIDENCE BOTH POINTED IN THAT DIRECTION
I THEREFORE CABLED TO MY
FRIEND WILSON HARGREAVE OF THE NEW YORK POLICE BUREAU WHO HAS MORE
THAN ONCE MADE USE OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON CRIME
I ASKED HIM WHETHER
THE NAME OF ABE SLANEY WAS KNOWN TO HIM
HERE IS HIS REPLY 'THE MOST
DANGEROUS CROOK IN CHICAGO ON THE VERY EVENING UPON WHICH I HAD HIS
ANSWER HILTON CUBITT SENT ME THE LAST MESSAGE FROM SLANEY
WORKING WITH
KNOWN LETTERS IT TOOK THIS FORM
ELSIE RE ARE TO MEET THY GO
THE ADDITION OF A P AND A D COMPLETED A MESSAGE WHICH SHOWED ME THAT THE
RASCAL WAS PROCEEDING FROM PERSUASION TO THREATS AND MY KNOWLEDGE OF
THE CROOKS OF CHICAGO PREPARED ME TO FIND THAT HE MIGHT VERY RAPIDLY
PUT HIS WORDS INTO ACTION
I AT ONCE CAME TO NORFOLK WITH MY FRIEND AND
COLLEAGUE DR
WATSON BUT UNHAPPILY ONLY IN TIME TO FIND THAT THE
WORST HAD ALREADY OCCURRED
IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH YOU IN THE HANDLING OF A CASE
SAID THE INSPECTOR WARMLY
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME HOWEVER IF I SPEAK
FRANKLY TO YOU
YOU ARE ONLY ANSWERABLE TO YOURSELF BUT I HAVE TO
ANSWER TO MY SUPERIORS
IF THIS ABE SLANEY LIVING AT ELRIGE'S IS
INDEED THE MURDERER AND IF HE HAS MADE HIS ESCAPE WHILE I AM SEATED
HERE I SHOULD CERTAINLY GET INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE
YOU NEED NOT BE UNEASY
HE WILL NOT TRY TO ESCAPE
HOW DO YOU KNOW
TO FLY WOULD BE A CONFESSION OF GUILT
THEN LET US GO ARREST HIM
I EXPECT HIM HERE EVERY INSTANT
BUT WHY SHOULD HE COME
BECAUSE I HAVE WRITTEN AND ASKED HIM
BUT THIS IS INCREDIBLE MR
HOLMES WHY SHOULD HE COME BECAUSE YOU
HAVE ASKED HIM WOULD NOT SUCH A REQUEST RATHER ROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS AND
CAUSE HIM TO FLY
I THINK I HAVE KNOWN HOW TO FRAME THE LETTER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
IN FACT IF I AM NOT VERY MUCH MISTAKEN HERE IS THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF
COMING UP THE DRIVE
A MAN WAS STRIDING UP THE PATH WHICH LED TO THE DOOR
HE WAS A TALL
HANDSOME SWARTHY FELLOW CLAD IN A SUIT OF GRAY FLANNEL WITH A PANAMA
HAT A BRISTLING BLACK BEARD AND A GREAT AGGRESSIVE HOOKED NOSE AND
FLOURISHING A CANE AS HE WALKED
HE SWAGGERED UP A PATH AS IF AS IF
THE PLACE BELONGED TO HIM AND WE HEARD HIS LOUD CONFIDENT PEAL AT THE
BELL
I THINK GENTLEMEN SAID HOLMES QUIETLY THAT WE HAD BEST TAKE UP
OUR POSITION BEHIND THE DOOR
EVERY PRECAUTION IS NECESSARY WHEN DEALING
WITH SUCH A FELLOW
YOU WILL NEED YOUR HANDCUFFS INSPECTOR
YOU CAN
LEAVE THE TALKING TO ME
WE WAITED IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE ONE OF THOSE MINUTES WHICH ONE CAN
NEVER FORGET
THEN THE DOOR OPENED AND THE MAN STEPPED IN
IN AN INSTANT
HOLMES CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND MARTIN SLIPPED THE HANDCUFFS
OVER HIS WRISTS
IT WAS ALL DONE SO SWIFTLY AND DEFTLY THAT THE FELLOW
WAS HELPLESS BEFORE HE KNEW THAT HE WAS ATTACKED
HE GLARED FROM ONE TO
THE OTHER OF US WITH A PAIR OF BLAZING BLACK EYES
THEN HE BURST INTO A
BITTER LAUGH
WELL GENTLEMEN YOU HAVE THE DROP ON ME THIS TIME
I SEEM TO HAVE
KNOCKED UP AGAINST SOMETHING HARD
BUT I CAME HERE IN ANSWER TO A LETTER
FROM MRS
HILTON CUBITT
DON'T TELL ME THAT SHE IS IN THIS DON'T TELL
ME THAT SHE HELPED TO SET A TRAP FOR ME
MRS
HILTON CUBITT WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AND IS AT DEATH'S DOOR
THE MAN GAVE A HOARSE CRY OF GRIEF WHICH RANG THROUGH THE HOUSE
YOU'RE CRAZY HE CRIED FIERCELY
IT WAS HE THAT WAS HURT NOT SHE
WHO WOULD HAVE HURT LITTLE ELSIE I MAY HAVE THREATENED HER GOD FORGIVE
ME BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE TOUCHED A HAIR OF HER PRETTY HEAD
TAKE IT
BACK YOU SAY THAT SHE IS NOT HURT
SHE WAS FOUND BADLY WOUNDED BY THE SIDE OF HER DEAD HUSBAND
HE SANK WITH A DEEP GROAN ON THE SETTEE AND BURIED HIS FACE IN HIS
MANACLED HANDS
FOR FIVE MINUTES HE WAS SILENT
THEN HE RAISED HIS FACE
ONCE MORE AND SPOKE WITH THE COLD COMPOSURE OF DESPAIR
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE FROM YOU GENTLEMEN SAID HE
IF I SHOT THE
MAN HE HAD HIS SHOT AT ME AND THERE'S NO MURDER IN THAT
BUT IF YOU
THINK I COULD HAVE HURT THAT WOMAN THEN YOU DON'T KNOW EITHER ME OR
HER
I TELL YOU THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN THIS WORLD LOVED A WOMAN MORE
THAN I LOVED HER
I HAD A RIGHT TO HER
SHE WAS PLEDGED TO ME YEARS AGO
WHO WAS THIS ENGLISHMAN THAT HE SHOULD COME BETWEEN US I TELL YOU THAT
I HAD THE FIRST RIGHT TO HER AND THAT I WAS ONLY CLAIMING MY OWN
SHE BROKE AWAY FROM YOUR INFLUENCE WHEN SHE FOUND THE MAN THAT YOU
ARE SAID HOLMES STERNLY
SHE FLED FROM AMERICA TO AVOID YOU AND SHE
MARRIED AN HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN IN ENGLAND
YOU DOGGED HER AND FOLLOWED
HER AND MADE HER LIFE A MISERY TO HER IN ORDER TO INDUCE HER TO ABANDON
THE HUSBAND WHOM SHE LOVED AND RESPECTED IN ORDER TO FLY WITH YOU WHOM
SHE FEARED AND HATED
YOU HAVE ENDED BY BRINGING ABOUT THE DEATH OF A
NOBLE MAN AND DRIVING HIS WIFE TO SUICIDE
THAT IS YOUR RECORD IN THIS
BUSINESS MR
ABE SLANEY AND YOU WILL ANSWER FOR IT TO THE LAW
IF ELSIE DIES I CARE NOTHING WHAT BECOMES OF ME SAID THE AMERICAN
HE OPENED ONE OF HIS HANDS AND LOOKED AT A NOTE CRUMPLED UP IN HIS
PALM
SEE HERE MISTER HE CRIED WITH A GLEAM OF SUSPICION IN HIS
EYES YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO SCARE ME OVER THIS ARE YOU IF THE LADY IS
HURT AS BAD AS YOU SAY WHO WAS IT THAT WROTE THIS NOTE HE TOSSED IT
FORWARD ON TO THE TABLE
I WROTE IT TO BRING YOU HERE
YOU WROTE IT THERE WAS NO ONE ON EARTH OUTSIDE THE JOINT WHO KNEW THE
SECRET OF THE DANCING MEN
HOW CAME YOU TO WRITE IT
WHAT ONE MAN CAN INVENT ANOTHER CAN DISCOVER SAID HOLMES
THERE IS A
CAB COMING TO CONVEY YOU TO NORWICH MR
SLANEY
BUT MEANWHILE YOU HAVE
TIME TO MAKE SOME SMALL REPARATION FOR THE INJURY YOU HAVE WROUGHT
ARE
YOU AWARE THAT MRS
HILTON CUBITT HAS HERSELF LAIN UNDER GRAVE SUSPICION
OF THE MURDER OF HER HUSBAND AND THAT IT WAS ONLY MY PRESENCE HERE AND
THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I HAPPENED TO POSSESS WHICH HAS SAVED HER FROM THE
ACCUSATION THE LEAST THAT YOU OWE HER IS TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE WHOLE
WORLD THAT SHE WAS IN NO WAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
HIS TRAGIC END
I ASK NOTHING BETTER SAID THE AMERICAN
I GUESS THE VERY BEST CASE I
CAN MAKE FOR MYSELF IS THE ABSOLUTE NAKED TRUTH
IT IS MY DUTY TO WARN YOU THAT IT WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU CRIED THE
INSPECTOR WITH THE MAGNIFICENT FAIR PLAY OF THE BRITISH CRIMINAL LAW
SLANEY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I'LL CHANCE THAT SAID HE
FIRST OF ALL I WANT YOU GENTLEMEN TO
UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE KNOWN THIS LADY SINCE SHE WAS A CHILD
THERE WERE
SEVEN OF US IN A GANG IN CHICAGO AND ELSIE'S FATHER WAS THE BOSS OF THE
JOINT
HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WAS OLD PATRICK
IT WAS HE WHO INVENTED THAT
WRITING WHICH WOULD PASS AS A CHILD'S SCRAWL UNLESS YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO HAVE THE KEY TO IT
WELL ELSIE LEARNED SOME OF OUR WAYS BUT SHE
COULDN'T STAND THE BUSINESS AND SHE HAD A BIT OF HONEST MONEY OF HER
OWN SO SHE GAVE US ALL THE SLIP AND GOT AWAY TO LONDON
SHE HAD BEEN
ENGAGED TO ME AND SHE WOULD HAVE MARRIED ME I BELIEVE IF I HAD TAKEN
OVER ANOTHER PROFESSION BUT SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING
ON THE CROSS
IT WAS ONLY AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO THIS ENGLISHMAN THAT I
WAS ABLE TO FIND OUT WHERE SHE WAS
I WROTE TO HER BUT GOT NO ANSWER
AFTER THAT I CAME OVER AND AS LETTERS WERE NO USE I PUT MY MESSAGES
WHERE SHE COULD READ THEM
WELL I HAVE BEEN HERE A MONTH NOW
I LIVED IN THAT FARM WHERE I HAD
A ROOM DOWN BELOW AND COULD GET IN AND OUT EVERY NIGHT AND NO ONE THE
WISER
I TRIED ALL I COULD TO COAX ELSIE AWAY
I KNEW THAT SHE READ THE
MESSAGES FOR ONCE SHE WROTE AN ANSWER UNDER ONE OF THEM
THEN MY TEMPER
GOT THE BETTER OF ME AND I BEGAN TO THREATEN HER
SHE SENT ME A LETTER
THEN IMPLORING ME TO GO AWAY AND SAYING THAT IT WOULD BREAK HER HEART
IF ANY SCANDAL SHOULD COME UPON HER HUSBAND
SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD
COME DOWN WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS ASLEEP AT THREE IN THE MORNING AND SPEAK
WITH ME THROUGH THE END WINDOW IF I WOULD GO AWAY AFTERWARDS AND LEAVE
HER IN PEACE
SHE CAME DOWN AND BROUGHT MONEY WITH HER TRYING TO BRIBE
ME TO GO
THIS MADE ME MAD AND I CAUGHT HER ARM AND TRIED TO PULL
HER THROUGH THE WINDOW
AT THAT MOMENT IN RUSHED THE HUSBAND WITH HIS
REVOLVER IN HIS HAND
ELSIE HAD SUNK DOWN UPON THE FLOOR AND WE WERE
FACE TO FACE
I WAS HEELED ALSO AND I HELD UP MY GUN TO SCARE HIM OFF
AND LET ME GET AWAY
HE FIRED AND MISSED ME
I PULLED OFF ALMOST AT THE
SAME INSTANT AND DOWN HE DROPPED
I MADE AWAY ACROSS THE GARDEN AND AS
I WENT I HEARD THE WINDOW SHUT BEHIND ME
THAT'S GOD'S TRUTH GENTLEMEN
EVERY WORD OF IT AND I HEARD NO MORE ABOUT IT UNTIL THAT LAD CAME
RIDING UP WITH A NOTE WHICH MADE ME WALK IN HERE LIKE A JAY AND GIVE
MYSELF INTO YOUR HANDS
A CAB HAD DRIVEN UP WHILST THE AMERICAN HAD BEEN TALKING
TWO UNIFORMED
POLICEMEN SAT INSIDE
INSPECTOR MARTIN ROSE AND TOUCHED HIS PRISONER ON
THE SHOULDER
IT IS TIME FOR US TO GO
CAN I SEE HER FIRST
NO SHE IS NOT CONSCIOUS
MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES I ONLY HOPE THAT IF EVER
AGAIN I HAVE AN IMPORTANT CASE I SHALL HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE
YOU BY MY SIDE
WE STOOD AT THE WINDOW AND WATCHED THE CAB DRIVE AWAY
AS I TURNED BACK
MY EYE CAUGHT THE PELLET OF PAPER WHICH THE PRISONER HAD TOSSED UPON THE
TABLE
IT WAS THE NOTE WITH WHICH HOLMES HAD DECOYED HIM
SEE IF YOU CAN READ IT WATSON SAID HE WITH A SMILE
IT CONTAINED NO WORD BUT THIS LITTLE LINE OF DANCING MEN
GRAPHIC
IF YOU USE THE CODE WHICH I HAVE EXPLAINED SAID HOLMES YOU WILL
FIND THAT IT SIMPLY MEANS 'COME HERE AT ONCE I WAS CONVINCED THAT
IT WAS AN INVITATION WHICH HE WOULD NOT REFUSE SINCE HE COULD NEVER
IMAGINE THAT IT COULD COME FROM ANYONE BUT THE LADY
AND SO MY DEAR
WATSON WE HAVE ENDED BY TURNING THE DANCING MEN TO GOOD WHEN THEY HAVE
SO OFTEN BEEN THE AGENTS OF EVIL AND I THINK THAT I HAVE FULFILLED MY
PROMISE OF GIVING YOU SOMETHING UNUSUAL FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK
THREE FORTY
IS OUR TRAIN AND I FANCY WE SHOULD BE BACK IN BAKER STREET FOR DINNER
ONLY ONE WORD OF EPILOGUE
THE AMERICAN ABE SLANEY WAS CONDEMNED TO
DEATH AT THE WINTER ASSIZES AT NORWICH BUT HIS PENALTY WAS CHANGED TO
PENAL SERVITUDE IN CONSIDERATION OF MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE
CERTAINTY THAT HILTON CUBITT HAD FIRED THE FIRST SHOT
OF MRS
HILTON
CUBITT I ONLY KNOW THAT I HAVE HEARD SHE RECOVERED ENTIRELY AND THAT
SHE STILL REMAINS A WIDOW DEVOTING HER WHOLE LIFE TO THE CARE OF THE
POOR AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER HUSBAND'S ESTATE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST
FROM THE YEARS 1894 TO 1901 INCLUSIVE MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A
VERY BUSY MAN
IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO PUBLIC CASE OF ANY
DIFFICULTY IN WHICH HE WAS NOT CONSULTED DURING THOSE EIGHT YEARS AND
THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PRIVATE CASES SOME OF THEM OF THE MOST INTRICATE
AND EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER IN WHICH HE PLAYED A PROMINENT PART
MANY
STARTLING SUCCESSES AND A FEW UNAVOIDABLE FAILURES WERE THE OUTCOME OF
THIS LONG PERIOD OF CONTINUOUS WORK
AS I HAVE PRESERVED VERY FULL NOTES
OF ALL THESE CASES AND WAS MYSELF PERSONALLY ENGAGED IN MANY OF THEM
IT MAY BE IMAGINED THAT IT IS NO EASY TASK TO KNOW WHICH I SHOULD SELECT
TO LAY BEFORE THE PUBLIC
I SHALL HOWEVER PRESERVE MY FORMER RULE AND
GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO THOSE CASES WHICH DERIVE THEIR INTEREST NOT SO
MUCH FROM THE BRUTALITY OF THE CRIME AS FROM THE INGENUITY AND DRAMATIC
QUALITY OF THE SOLUTION
FOR THIS REASON I WILL NOW LAY BEFORE THE
READER THE FACTS CONNECTED WITH MISS VIOLET SMITH THE SOLITARY CYCLIST
OF CHARLINGTON AND THE CURIOUS SEQUEL OF OUR INVESTIGATION WHICH
CULMINATED IN UNEXPECTED TRAGEDY
IT IS TRUE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID
NOT ADMIT OF ANY STRIKING ILLUSTRATION OF THOSE POWERS FOR WHICH MY
FRIEND WAS FAMOUS BUT THERE WERE SOME POINTS ABOUT THE CASE WHICH MADE
IT STAND OUT IN THOSE LONG RECORDS OF CRIME FROM WHICH I GATHER THE
MATERIAL FOR THESE LITTLE NARRATIVES
ON REFERRING TO MY NOTEBOOK FOR THE YEAR 1895 I FIND THAT IT WAS UPON
SATURDAY THE 23RD OF APRIL THAT WE FIRST HEARD OF MISS VIOLET SMITH
HER VISIT WAS I REMEMBER EXTREMELY UNWELCOME TO HOLMES FOR HE WAS
IMMERSED AT THE MOMENT IN A VERY ABSTRUSE AND COMPLICATED PROBLEM
CONCERNING THE PECULIAR PERSECUTION TO WHICH JOHN VINCENT HARDEN THE
WELL KNOWN TOBACCO MILLIONAIRE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED
MY FRIEND WHO
LOVED ABOVE ALL THINGS PRECISION AND CONCENTRATION OF THOUGHT RESENTED
ANYTHING WHICH DISTRACTED HIS ATTENTION FROM THE MATTER IN HAND
AND YET WITHOUT A HARSHNESS WHICH WAS FOREIGN TO HIS NATURE IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE STORY OF THE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN TALL GRACEFUL AND QUEENLY WHO PRESENTED HERSELF AT BAKER
STREET LATE IN THE EVENING AND IMPLORED HIS ASSISTANCE AND ADVICE
IT
WAS VAIN TO URGE THAT HIS TIME WAS ALREADY FULLY OCCUPIED FOR THE
YOUNG LADY HAD COME WITH THE DETERMINATION TO TELL HER STORY AND IT WAS
EVIDENT THAT NOTHING SHORT OF FORCE COULD GET HER OUT OF THE ROOM UNTIL
SHE HAD DONE SO
WITH A RESIGNED AIR AND A SOMEWHAT WEARY SMILE HOLMES
BEGGED THE BEAUTIFUL INTRUDER TO TAKE A SEAT AND TO INFORM US WHAT IT
WAS THAT WAS TROUBLING HER
AT LEAST IT CANNOT BE YOUR HEALTH SAID HE AS HIS KEEN EYES DARTED
OVER HER SO ARDENT A BICYCLIST MUST BE FULL OF ENERGY
SHE GLANCED DOWN IN SURPRISE AT HER OWN FEET AND I OBSERVED THE SLIGHT
ROUGHENING OF THE SIDE OF THE SOLE CAUSED BY THE FRICTION OF THE EDGE OF
THE PEDAL
YES I BICYCLE A GOOD DEAL MR
HOLMES AND THAT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MY VISIT TO YOU TO DAY
MY FRIEND TOOK THE LADY'S UNGLOVED HAND AND EXAMINED IT WITH AS CLOSE
AN ATTENTION AND AS LITTLE SENTIMENT AS A SCIENTIST WOULD SHOW TO A
SPECIMEN
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME I AM SURE
IT IS MY BUSINESS SAID HE AS HE
DROPPED IT
I NEARLY FELL INTO THE ERROR OF SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE
TYPEWRITING
OF COURSE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT IS MUSIC
YOU OBSERVE
THE SPATULATE FINGER ENDS WATSON WHICH IS COMMON TO BOTH PROFESSIONS
THERE IS A SPIRITUALITY ABOUT THE FACE HOWEVER SHE GENTLY TURNED IT
TOWARDS THE LIGHT WHICH THE TYPEWRITER DOES NOT GENERATE
THIS LADY IS
A MUSICIAN
YES MR
HOLMES I TEACH MUSIC
IN THE COUNTRY I PRESUME FROM YOUR COMPLEXION
YES SIR NEAR FARNHAM ON THE BORDERS OF SURREY
A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBOURHOOD AND FULL OF THE MOST INTERESTING
ASSOCIATIONS
YOU REMEMBER WATSON THAT IT WAS NEAR THERE THAT WE TOOK
ARCHIE STAMFORD THE FORGER
NOW MISS VIOLET WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
NEAR FARNHAM ON THE BORDERS OF SURREY
THE YOUNG LADY WITH GREAT CLEARNESS AND COMPOSURE MADE THE FOLLOWING
CURIOUS STATEMENT
MY FATHER IS DEAD MR
HOLMES
HE WAS JAMES SMITH WHO CONDUCTED THE
ORCHESTRA AT THE OLD IMPERIAL THEATRE
MY MOTHER AND I WERE LEFT WITHOUT
A RELATION IN THE WORLD EXCEPT ONE UNCLE RALPH SMITH WHO WENT TO
AFRICA TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE NEVER HAD A WORD FROM HIM
SINCE
WHEN FATHER DIED WE WERE LEFT VERY POOR BUT ONE DAY WE WERE
TOLD THAT THERE WAS AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE TIMES INQUIRING FOR OUR
WHEREABOUTS
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITED WE WERE FOR WE THOUGHT THAT
SOMEONE HAD LEFT US A FORTUNE
WE WENT AT ONCE TO THE LAWYER WHOSE NAME
WAS GIVEN IN THE PAPER
THERE WE MET TWO GENTLEMEN MR
CARRUTHERS AND
MR
WOODLEY WHO WERE HOME ON A VISIT FROM SOUTH AFRICA
THEY SAID THAT
MY UNCLE WAS A FRIEND OF THEIRS THAT HE HAD DIED SOME MONTHS BEFORE IN
GREAT POVERTY IN JOHANNESBURG AND THAT HE HAD ASKED THEM WITH HIS LAST
BREATH TO HUNT UP HIS RELATIONS AND SEE THAT THEY WERE IN NO WANT
IT
SEEMED STRANGE TO US THAT UNCLE RALPH WHO TOOK NO NOTICE OF US WHEN HE
WAS ALIVE SHOULD BE SO CAREFUL TO LOOK AFTER US WHEN HE WAS DEAD BUT
MR
CARRUTHERS EXPLAINED THAT THE REASON WAS THAT MY UNCLE HAD JUST
HEARD OF THE DEATH OF HIS BROTHER AND SO FELT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR
FATE
EXCUSE ME SAID HOLMES
WHEN WAS THIS INTERVIEW
LAST DECEMBER FOUR MONTHS AGO
PRAY PROCEED
MR
WOODLEY SEEMED TO ME TO BE A MOST ODIOUS PERSON
HE WAS FOR EVER
MAKING EYES AT ME A COARSE PUFFY FACED RED MOUSTACHED YOUNG MAN WITH
HIS HAIR PLASTERED DOWN ON EACH SIDE OF HIS FOREHEAD
I THOUGHT THAT HE
WAS PERFECTLY HATEFUL AND I WAS SURE THAT CYRIL WOULD NOT WISH ME TO
KNOW SUCH A PERSON
OH CYRIL IS HIS NAME SAID HOLMES SMILING
THE YOUNG LADY BLUSHED AND LAUGHED
YES MR
HOLMES CYRIL MORTON AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND WE HOPE
TO BE MARRIED AT THE END OF THE SUMMER
DEAR ME HOW DID I GET TALKING
ABOUT HIM WHAT I WISHED TO SAY WAS THAT MR
WOODLEY WAS PERFECTLY
ODIOUS BUT THAT MR
CARRUTHERS WHO WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN WAS MORE
AGREEABLE
HE WAS A DARK SALLOW CLEAN SHAVEN SILENT PERSON BUT HE
HAD POLITE MANNERS AND A PLEASANT SMILE
HE INQUIRED HOW WE WERE LEFT
AND ON FINDING THAT WE WERE VERY POOR HE SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD COME
AND TEACH MUSIC TO HIS ONLY DAUGHTER AGED TEN
I SAID THAT I DID NOT
LIKE TO LEAVE MY MOTHER ON WHICH HE SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD GO HOME
TO HER EVERY WEEK END AND HE OFFERED ME A HUNDRED A YEAR WHICH WAS
CERTAINLY SPLENDID PAY
SO IT ENDED BY MY ACCEPTING AND I WENT DOWN
TO CHILTERN GRANGE ABOUT SIX MILES FROM FARNHAM
MR
CARRUTHERS WAS
A WIDOWER BUT HE HAD ENGAGED A LADY HOUSEKEEPER A VERY RESPECTABLE
ELDERLY PERSON CALLED MRS
DIXON TO LOOK AFTER HIS ESTABLISHMENT
THE
CHILD WAS A DEAR AND EVERYTHING PROMISED WELL
MR
CARRUTHERS WAS VERY
KIND AND VERY MUSICAL AND WE HAD MOST PLEASANT EVENINGS TOGETHER
EVERY
WEEK END I WENT HOME TO MY MOTHER IN TOWN
THE FIRST FLAW IN MY HAPPINESS WAS THE ARRIVAL OF THE RED MOUSTACHED
MR
WOODLEY
HE CAME FOR A VISIT OF A WEEK AND OH IT SEEMED THREE
MONTHS TO ME
HE WAS A DREADFUL PERSON A BULLY TO EVERYONE ELSE BUT TO
ME SOMETHING INFINITELY WORSE
HE MADE ODIOUS LOVE TO ME BOASTED OF HIS
WEALTH SAID THAT IF I MARRIED HIM I COULD HAVE THE FINEST DIAMONDS IN
LONDON AND FINALLY WHEN I WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE SEIZED
ME IN HIS ARMS ONE DAY AFTER DINNER HE WAS HIDEOUSLY STRONG AND SWORE
THAT HE WOULD NOT LET ME GO UNTIL I HAD KISSED HIM
MR
CARRUTHERS CAME
IN AND TORE HIM FROM ME ON WHICH HE TURNED UPON HIS OWN HOST KNOCKING
HIM DOWN AND CUTTING HIS FACE OPEN
THAT WAS THE END OF HIS VISIT AS
YOU CAN IMAGINE
MR
CARRUTHERS APOLOGIZED TO ME NEXT DAY AND ASSURED
ME THAT I SHOULD NEVER BE EXPOSED TO SUCH AN INSULT AGAIN
I HAVE NOT
SEEN MR
WOODLEY SINCE
AND NOW MR
HOLMES I COME AT LAST TO THE SPECIAL THING WHICH HAS
CAUSED ME TO ASK YOUR ADVICE TO DAY
YOU MUST KNOW THAT EVERY SATURDAY
FORENOON I RIDE ON MY BICYCLE TO FARNHAM STATION IN ORDER TO GET THE
12 22 TO TOWN
THE ROAD FROM CHILTERN GRANGE IS A LONELY ONE AND AT
ONE SPOT IT IS PARTICULARLY SO FOR IT LIES FOR OVER A MILE BETWEEN
CHARLINGTON HEATH UPON ONE SIDE AND THE WOODS WHICH LIE ROUND
CHARLINGTON HALL UPON THE OTHER
YOU COULD NOT FIND A MORE LONELY TRACT
OF ROAD ANYWHERE AND IT IS QUITE RARE TO MEET SO MUCH AS A CART OR A
PEASANT UNTIL YOU REACH THE HIGH ROAD NEAR CROOKSBURY HILL
TWO WEEKS
AGO I WAS PASSING THIS PLACE WHEN I CHANCED TO LOOK BACK OVER MY
SHOULDER AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND ME I SAW A MAN ALSO ON A
BICYCLE
HE SEEMED TO BE A MIDDLE AGED MAN WITH A SHORT DARK BEARD
I
LOOKED BACK BEFORE I REACHED FARNHAM BUT THE MAN WAS GONE SO I THOUGHT
NO MORE ABOUT IT
BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW SURPRISED I WAS MR
HOLMES
WHEN ON MY RETURN ON THE MONDAY I SAW THE SAME MAN ON THE SAME STRETCH
OF ROAD
MY ASTONISHMENT WAS INCREASED WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AGAIN
EXACTLY AS BEFORE ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY AND MONDAY
HE ALWAYS KEPT
HIS DISTANCE AND DID NOT MOLEST ME IN ANY WAY BUT STILL IT CERTAINLY
WAS VERY ODD
I MENTIONED IT TO MR
CARRUTHERS WHO SEEMED INTERESTED IN
WHAT I SAID AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ORDERED A HORSE AND TRAP SO
THAT IN FUTURE I SHOULD NOT PASS OVER THESE LONELY ROADS WITHOUT SOME
COMPANION
THE HORSE AND TRAP WERE TO HAVE COME THIS WEEK BUT FOR SOME REASON
THEY WERE NOT DELIVERED AND AGAIN I HAD TO CYCLE TO THE STATION
THAT WAS THIS MORNING
YOU CAN THINK THAT I LOOKED OUT WHEN I CAME TO
CHARLINGTON HEATH AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE MAN EXACTLY AS HE
HAD BEEN THE TWO WEEKS BEFORE
HE ALWAYS KEPT SO FAR FROM ME THAT I
COULD NOT CLEARLY SEE HIS FACE BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY SOMEONE WHOM I DID
NOT KNOW
HE WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT WITH A CLOTH CAP
THE ONLY THING
ABOUT HIS FACE THAT I COULD CLEARLY SEE WAS HIS DARK BEARD
TO DAY I WAS
NOT ALARMED BUT I WAS FILLED WITH CURIOSITY AND I DETERMINED TO FIND
OUT WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE WANTED
I SLOWED DOWN MY MACHINE BUT HE
SLOWED DOWN HIS
THEN I STOPPED ALTOGETHER BUT HE STOPPED ALSO
THEN
I LAID A TRAP FOR HIM
THERE IS A SHARP TURNING OF THE ROAD AND I
PEDALLED VERY QUICKLY ROUND THIS AND THEN I STOPPED AND WAITED
I
EXPECTED HIM TO SHOOT ROUND AND PASS ME BEFORE HE COULD STOP
BUT HE
NEVER APPEARED
THEN I WENT BACK AND LOOKED ROUND THE CORNER
I
COULD SEE A MILE OF ROAD BUT HE WAS NOT ON IT
TO MAKE IT THE MORE
EXTRAORDINARY THERE WAS NO SIDE ROAD AT THIS POINT DOWN WHICH HE COULD
HAVE GONE
HOLMES CHUCKLED AND RUBBED HIS HANDS
THIS CASE CERTAINLY PRESENTS
SOME FEATURES OF ITS OWN SAID HE
HOW MUCH TIME ELAPSED BETWEEN YOUR
TURNING THE CORNER AND YOUR DISCOVERY THAT THE ROAD WAS CLEAR
TWO OR THREE MINUTES
THEN HE COULD NOT HAVE RETREATED DOWN THE ROAD AND YOU SAY THAT THERE
ARE NO SIDE ROADS
NONE
THEN HE CERTAINLY TOOK A FOOTPATH ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE SIDE OF THE HEATH OR I SHOULD HAVE SEEN
HIM
SO BY THE PROCESS OF EXCLUSION WE ARRIVE AT THE FACT THAT HE MADE HIS
WAY TOWARD CHARLINGTON HALL WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IS SITUATED IN ITS
OWN GROUNDS ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD
ANYTHING ELSE
NOTHING MR
HOLMES SAVE THAT I WAS SO PERPLEXED THAT I FELT I SHOULD
NOT BE HAPPY UNTIL I HAD SEEN YOU AND HAD YOUR ADVICE
HOLMES SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
WHERE IS THE GENTLEMAN TO WHOM YOU ARE ENGAGED HE ASKED AT LAST
HE IS IN THE MIDLAND ELECTRICAL COMPANY AT COVENTRY
HE WOULD NOT PAY YOU A SURPRISE VISIT
OH MR
HOLMES AS IF I SHOULD NOT KNOW HIM
HAVE YOU HAD ANY OTHER ADMIRERS
SEVERAL BEFORE I KNEW CYRIL
AND SINCE
THERE WAS THIS DREADFUL MAN WOODLEY IF YOU CAN CALL HIM AN ADMIRER
NO ONE ELSE
OUR FAIR CLIENT SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED
WHO WAS HE ASKED HOLMES
OH IT MAY BE A MERE FANCY OF MINE BUT IT HAD SEEMED TO ME SOMETIMES
THAT MY EMPLOYER MR
CARRUTHERS TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN ME
WE ARE THROWN RATHER TOGETHER
I PLAY HIS ACCOMPANIMENTS IN THE EVENING
HE HAS NEVER SAID ANYTHING
HE IS A PERFECT GENTLEMAN
BUT A GIRL ALWAYS
KNOWS
HA HOLMES LOOKED GRAVE
WHAT DOES HE DO FOR A LIVING
HE IS A RICH MAN
NO CARRIAGES OR HORSES
WELL AT LEAST HE IS FAIRLY WELL TO DO
BUT HE GOES INTO THE CITY TWO
OR THREE TIMES A WEEK
HE IS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD
SHARES
YOU WILL LET ME KNOW ANY FRESH DEVELOPMENT MISS SMITH
I AM VERY BUSY
JUST NOW BUT I WILL FIND TIME TO MAKE SOME INQUIRIES INTO YOUR CASE
IN THE MEANTIME TAKE NO STEP WITHOUT LETTING ME KNOW
GOOD BYE AND I
TRUST THAT WE SHALL HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS FROM YOU
IT IS PART OF THE SETTLED ORDER OF NATURE THAT SUCH A GIRL SHOULD HAVE
FOLLOWERS SAID HOLMES HE PULLED AT HIS MEDITATIVE PIPE BUT FOR
CHOICE NOT ON BICYCLES IN LONELY COUNTRY ROADS
SOME SECRETIVE LOVER
BEYOND ALL DOUBT
BUT THERE ARE CURIOUS AND SUGGESTIVE DETAILS ABOUT THE
CASE WATSON
THAT HE SHOULD APPEAR ONLY AT THAT POINT
EXACTLY
OUR FIRST EFFORT MUST BE TO FIND WHO ARE THE TENANTS OF
CHARLINGTON HALL
THEN AGAIN HOW ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
CARRUTHERS AND WOODLEY SINCE THEY APPEAR TO BE MEN OF SUCH A DIFFERENT
TYPE HOW CAME THEY BOTH TO BE SO KEEN UPON LOOKING UP RALPH SMITH'S
RELATIONS ONE MORE POINT
WHAT SORT OF A MENAGE IS IT WHICH PAYS DOUBLE
THE MARKET PRICE FOR A GOVERNESS BUT DOES NOT KEEP A HORSE ALTHOUGH SIX
MILES FROM THE STATION ODD WATSON VERY ODD
YOU WILL GO DOWN
NO MY DEAR FELLOW YOU WILL GO DOWN
THIS MAY BE SOME TRIFLING
INTRIGUE AND I CANNOT BREAK MY OTHER IMPORTANT RESEARCH FOR THE SAKE
OF IT
ON MONDAY YOU WILL ARRIVE EARLY AT FARNHAM YOU WILL CONCEAL
YOURSELF NEAR CHARLINGTON HEATH YOU WILL OBSERVE THESE FACTS FOR
YOURSELF AND ACT AS YOUR OWN JUDGMENT ADVISES
THEN HAVING INQUIRED AS
TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE HALL YOU WILL COME BACK TO ME AND REPORT
AND
NOW WATSON NOT ANOTHER WORD OF THE MATTER UNTIL WE HAVE A FEW SOLID
STEPPING STONES ON WHICH WE MAY HOPE TO GET ACROSS TO OUR SOLUTION
WE HAD ASCERTAINED FROM THE LADY THAT SHE WENT DOWN UPON THE MONDAY BY
THE TRAIN WHICH LEAVES WATERLOO AT 9 50 SO I STARTED EARLY AND CAUGHT
THE 9 13
AT FARNHAM STATION I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN BEING DIRECTED TO
CHARLINGTON HEATH
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISTAKE THE SCENE OF THE YOUNG
LADY'S ADVENTURE FOR THE ROAD RUNS BETWEEN THE OPEN HEATH ON ONE SIDE
AND AN OLD YEW HEDGE UPON THE OTHER SURROUNDING A PARK WHICH IS STUDDED
WITH MAGNIFICENT TREES
THERE WAS A MAIN GATEWAY OF LICHEN STUDDED
STONE EACH SIDE PILLAR SURMOUNTED BY MOULDERING HERALDIC EMBLEMS BUT
BESIDES THIS CENTRAL CARRIAGE DRIVE I OBSERVED SEVERAL POINTS WHERE
THERE WERE GAPS IN THE HEDGE AND PATHS LEADING THROUGH THEM
THE HOUSE
WAS INVISIBLE FROM THE ROAD BUT THE SURROUNDINGS ALL SPOKE OF GLOOM AND
DECAY
THE HEATH WAS COVERED WITH GOLDEN PATCHES OF FLOWERING GORSE GLEAMING
MAGNIFICENTLY IN THE LIGHT OF THE BRIGHT SPRING SUNSHINE
BEHIND ONE OF
THESE CLUMPS I TOOK UP MY POSITION SO AS TO COMMAND BOTH THE GATEWAY
OF THE HALL AND A LONG STRETCH OF THE ROAD UPON EITHER SIDE
IT HAD BEEN
DESERTED WHEN I LEFT IT BUT NOW I SAW A CYCLIST RIDING DOWN IT FROM THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT IN WHICH I HAD COME
HE WAS CLAD IN A DARK
SUIT AND I SAW THAT HE HAD A BLACK BEARD
ON REACHING THE END OF THE
CHARLINGTON GROUNDS HE SPRANG FROM HIS MACHINE AND LED IT THROUGH A GAP
IN THE HEDGE DISAPPEARING FROM MY VIEW
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR PASSED AND THEN A SECOND CYCLIST APPEARED
THIS
TIME IT WAS THE YOUNG LADY COMING FROM THE STATION
I SAW HER LOOK
ABOUT HER AS SHE CAME TO THE CHARLINGTON HEDGE
AN INSTANT LATER THE MAN
EMERGED FROM HIS HIDING PLACE SPRANG UPON HIS CYCLE AND FOLLOWED
HER
IN ALL THE BROAD LANDSCAPE THOSE WERE THE ONLY MOVING FIGURES THE
GRACEFUL GIRL SITTING VERY STRAIGHT UPON HER MACHINE AND THE MAN BEHIND
HER BENDING LOW OVER HIS HANDLE BAR WITH A CURIOUSLY FURTIVE SUGGESTION
IN EVERY MOVEMENT
SHE LOOKED BACK AT HIM AND SLOWED HER PACE
HE SLOWED
ALSO
SHE STOPPED
HE AT ONCE STOPPED TOO KEEPING TWO HUNDRED YARDS
BEHIND HER
HER NEXT MOVEMENT WAS AS UNEXPECTED AS IT WAS SPIRITED
SHE
SUDDENLY WHISKED HER WHEELS ROUND AND DASHED STRAIGHT AT HIM
HE WAS AS
QUICK AS SHE HOWEVER AND DARTED OFF IN DESPERATE FLIGHT
PRESENTLY SHE
CAME BACK UP THE ROAD AGAIN HER HEAD HAUGHTILY IN THE AIR NOT DEIGNING
TO TAKE ANY FURTHER NOTICE OF HER SILENT ATTENDANT
HE HAD TURNED ALSO
AND STILL KEPT HIS DISTANCE UNTIL THE CURVE OF THE ROAD HID THEM FROM MY
SIGHT
I REMAINED IN MY HIDING PLACE AND IT WAS WELL THAT I DID SO FOR
PRESENTLY THE MAN REAPPEARED CYCLING SLOWLY BACK
HE TURNED IN AT THE
HALL GATES AND DISMOUNTED FROM HIS MACHINE
FOR SOME MINUTES I COULD
SEE HIM STANDING AMONG THE TREES
HIS HANDS WERE RAISED AND HE SEEMED
TO BE SETTLING HIS NECKTIE
THEN HE MOUNTED HIS CYCLE AND RODE AWAY
FROM ME DOWN THE DRIVE TOWARDS THE HALL
I RAN ACROSS THE HEATH AND
PEERED THROUGH THE TREES
FAR AWAY I COULD CATCH GLIMPSES OF THE OLD
GRAY BUILDING WITH ITS BRISTLING TUDOR CHIMNEYS BUT THE DRIVE RAN
THROUGH A DENSE SHRUBBERY AND I SAW NO MORE OF MY MAN
HOWEVER IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD DONE A FAIRLY GOOD MORNING'S WORK
AND I WALKED BACK IN HIGH SPIRITS TO FARNHAM
THE LOCAL HOUSE AGENT
COULD TELL ME NOTHING ABOUT CHARLINGTON HALL AND REFERRED ME TO A WELL
KNOWN FIRM IN PALL MALL
THERE I HALTED ON MY WAY HOME AND MET WITH
COURTESY FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE
NO I COULD NOT HAVE CHARLINGTON HALL
FOR THE SUMMER
I WAS JUST TOO LATE
IT HAD BEEN LET ABOUT A MONTH AGO
MR
WILLIAMSON WAS THE NAME OF THE TENANT
HE WAS A RESPECTABLE ELDERLY
GENTLEMAN
THE POLITE AGENT WAS AFRAID HE COULD SAY NO MORE AS THE
AFFAIRS OF HIS CLIENTS WERE NOT MATTERS WHICH HE COULD DISCUSS
MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES LISTENED WITH ATTENTION TO THE LONG REPORT WHICH I
WAS ABLE TO PRESENT TO HIM THAT EVENING BUT IT DID NOT ELICIT THAT
WORD OF CURT PRAISE WHICH I HAD HOPED FOR AND SHOULD HAVE VALUED
ON
THE CONTRARY HIS AUSTERE FACE WAS EVEN MORE SEVERE THAN USUAL AS HE
COMMENTED UPON THE THINGS THAT I HAD DONE AND THE THINGS THAT I HAD NOT
YOUR HIDING PLACE MY DEAR WATSON WAS VERY FAULTY
YOU SHOULD HAVE
BEEN BEHIND THE HEDGE THEN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A CLOSE VIEW OF THIS
INTERESTING PERSON
AS IT IS YOU WERE SOME HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY AND
CAN TELL ME EVEN LESS THAN MISS SMITH
SHE THINKS SHE DOES NOT KNOW
THE MAN I AM CONVINCED SHE DOES
WHY OTHERWISE SHOULD HE BE SO
DESPERATELY ANXIOUS THAT SHE SHOULD NOT GET SO NEAR HIM AS TO SEE HIS
FEATURES YOU DESCRIBE HIM AS BENDING OVER THE HANDLE BAR
CONCEALMENT
AGAIN YOU SEE
YOU REALLY HAVE DONE REMARKABLY BADLY
HE RETURNS TO THE
HOUSE AND YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHO HE IS
YOU COME TO A LONDON HOUSE
AGENT
WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE I CRIED WITH SOME HEAT
GONE TO THE NEAREST PUBLIC HOUSE
THAT IS THE CENTRE OF COUNTRY
GOSSIP
THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU EVERY NAME FROM THE MASTER TO THE
SCULLERY MAID
WILLIAMSON IT CONVEYS NOTHING TO MY MIND
IF HE IS AN
ELDERLY MAN HE IS NOT THIS ACTIVE CYCLIST WHO SPRINTS AWAY FROM THAT
YOUNG LADY'S ATHLETIC PURSUIT
WHAT HAVE WE GAINED BY YOUR EXPEDITION
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE GIRL'S STORY IS TRUE
I NEVER DOUBTED IT
THAT
THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CYCLIST AND THE HALL
I NEVER DOUBTED
THAT EITHER
THAT THE HALL IS TENANTED BY WILLIAMSON
WHO'S THE BETTER
FOR THAT WELL WELL MY DEAR SIR DON'T LOOK SO DEPRESSED
WE CAN DO
LITTLE MORE UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY AND IN THE MEANTIME I MAY MAKE ONE OR
TWO INQUIRIES MYSELF
NEXT MORNING WE HAD A NOTE FROM MISS SMITH RECOUNTING SHORTLY AND
ACCURATELY THE VERY INCIDENTS WHICH I HAD SEEN BUT THE PITH OF THE
LETTER LAY IN THE POSTSCRIPT
I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL RESPECT MY CONFIDENCE MR
HOLMES WHEN I TELL
YOU THAT MY PLACE HERE HAS BECOME DIFFICULT OWING TO THE FACT THAT MY
EMPLOYER HAS PROPOSED MARRIAGE TO ME
I AM CONVINCED THAT HIS FEELINGS
ARE MOST DEEP AND MOST HONOURABLE
AT THE SAME TIME MY PROMISE IS OF
COURSE GIVEN
HE TOOK MY REFUSAL VERY SERIOUSLY BUT ALSO VERY GENTLY
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT THE SITUATION IS A LITTLE STRAINED
OUR YOUNG FRIEND SEEMS TO BE GETTING INTO DEEP WATERS SAID HOLMES
THOUGHTFULLY AS HE FINISHED THE LETTER
THE CASE CERTAINLY PRESENTS
MORE FEATURES OF INTEREST AND MORE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPMENT THAN I HAD
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT
I SHOULD BE NONE THE WORSE FOR A QUIET PEACEFUL DAY
IN THE COUNTRY AND I AM INCLINED TO RUN DOWN THIS AFTERNOON AND TEST
ONE OR TWO THEORIES WHICH I HAVE FORMED
HOLMES'S QUIET DAY IN THE COUNTRY HAD A SINGULAR TERMINATION FOR
HE ARRIVED AT BAKER STREET LATE IN THE EVENING WITH A CUT LIP AND A
DISCOLOURED LUMP UPON HIS FOREHEAD BESIDES A GENERAL AIR OF DISSIPATION
WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE HIS OWN PERSON THE FITTING OBJECT OF A SCOTLAND
YARD INVESTIGATION
HE WAS IMMENSELY TICKLED BY HIS OWN ADVENTURES AND
LAUGHED HEARTILY AS HE RECOUNTED THEM
I GET SO LITTLE ACTIVE EXERCISE THAT IT IS ALWAYS A TREAT SAID HE
YOU ARE AWARE THAT I HAVE SOME PROFICIENCY IN THE GOOD OLD BRITISH
SPORT OF BOXING
OCCASIONALLY IT IS OF SERVICE TO DAY FOR EXAMPLE I
SHOULD HAVE COME TO VERY IGNOMINIOUS GRIEF WITHOUT IT
I BEGGED HIM TO TELL ME WHAT HAD OCCURRED
I FOUND THAT COUNTRY PUB WHICH I HAD ALREADY RECOMMENDED TO YOUR
NOTICE AND THERE I MADE MY DISCREET INQUIRIES
I WAS IN THE BAR AND
A GARRULOUS LANDLORD WAS GIVING ME ALL THAT I WANTED
WILLIAMSON IS A
WHITE BEARDED MAN AND HE LIVES ALONE WITH A SMALL STAFF OF SERVANTS AT
THE HALL
THERE IS SOME RUMOR THAT HE IS OR HAS BEEN A CLERGYMAN BUT
ONE OR TWO INCIDENTS OF HIS SHORT RESIDENCE AT THE HALL STRUCK ME AS
PECULIARLY UNECCLESIASTICAL
I HAVE ALREADY MADE SOME INQUIRIES AT A
CLERICAL AGENCY AND THEY TELL ME THAT THERE WAS A MAN OF THAT NAME
IN ORDERS WHOSE CAREER HAS BEEN A SINGULARLY DARK ONE
THE LANDLORD
FURTHER INFORMED ME THAT THERE ARE USUALLY WEEK END VISITORS 'A
WARM LOT SIR' AT THE HALL AND ESPECIALLY ONE GENTLEMAN WITH A RED
MOUSTACHE MR
WOODLEY BY NAME WHO WAS ALWAYS THERE
WE HAD GOT AS FAR
AS THIS WHEN WHO SHOULD WALK IN BUT THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WHO HAD BEEN
DRINKING HIS BEER IN THE TAP ROOM AND HAD HEARD THE WHOLE CONVERSATION
WHO WAS I WHAT DID I WANT WHAT DID I MEAN BY ASKING QUESTIONS HE HAD
A FINE FLOW OF LANGUAGE AND HIS ADJECTIVES WERE VERY VIGOROUS
HE ENDED
A STRING OF ABUSE BY A VICIOUS BACKHANDER WHICH I FAILED TO ENTIRELY
AVOID
THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE DELICIOUS
IT WAS A STRAIGHT LEFT
AGAINST A SLOGGING RUFFIAN
I EMERGED AS YOU SEE ME
MR
WOODLEY WENT
HOME IN A CART
SO ENDED MY COUNTRY TRIP AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
HOWEVER ENJOYABLE MY DAY ON THE SURREY BORDER HAS NOT BEEN MUCH MORE
PROFITABLE THAN YOUR OWN
THE THURSDAY BROUGHT US ANOTHER LETTER FROM OUR CLIENT
YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED MR
HOLMES SAID SHE TO HEAR THAT I AM
LEAVING MR
CARRUTHERS'S EMPLOYMENT
EVEN THE HIGH PAY CANNOT RECONCILE
ME TO THE DISCOMFORTS OF MY SITUATION
ON SATURDAY I COME UP TO TOWN
AND I DO NOT INTEND TO RETURN
MR
CARRUTHERS HAS GOT A TRAP AND SO
THE DANGERS OF THE LONELY ROAD IF THERE EVER WERE ANY DANGERS ARE NOW
OVER
AS TO THE SPECIAL CAUSE OF MY LEAVING IT IS NOT MERELY THE STRAINED
SITUATION WITH MR
CARRUTHERS BUT IT IS THE REAPPEARANCE OF THAT ODIOUS
MAN MR
WOODLEY
HE WAS ALWAYS HIDEOUS BUT HE LOOKS MORE AWFUL
THAN EVER NOW FOR HE APPEARS TO HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT AND HE IS MUCH
DISFIGURED
I SAW HIM OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT I AM GLAD TO SAY I DID
NOT MEET HIM
HE HAD A LONG TALK WITH MR
CARRUTHERS WHO SEEMED MUCH
EXCITED AFTERWARDS
WOODLEY MUST BE STAYING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR
HE DID NOT SLEEP HERE AND YET I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIM AGAIN THIS
MORNING SLINKING ABOUT IN THE SHRUBBERY
I WOULD SOONER HAVE A SAVAGE
WILD ANIMAL LOOSE ABOUT THE PLACE
I LOATHE AND FEAR HIM MORE THAN I
CAN SAY
HOW CAN MR
CARRUTHERS ENDURE SUCH A CREATURE FOR A MOMENT
HOWEVER ALL MY TROUBLES WILL BE OVER ON SATURDAY
SO I TRUST WATSON SO I TRUST SAID HOLMES GRAVELY
THERE IS SOME
DEEP INTRIGUE GOING ON ROUND THAT LITTLE WOMAN AND IT IS OUR DUTY TO
SEE THAT NO ONE MOLESTS HER UPON THAT LAST JOURNEY
I THINK WATSON
THAT WE MUST SPARE TIME TO RUN DOWN TOGETHER ON SATURDAY MORNING AND
MAKE SURE THAT THIS CURIOUS AND INCLUSIVE INVESTIGATION HAS NO UNTOWARD
ENDING
I CONFESS THAT I HAD NOT UP TO NOW TAKEN A VERY SERIOUS VIEW OF
THE CASE WHICH HAD SEEMED TO ME RATHER GROTESQUE AND BIZARRE THAN
DANGEROUS
THAT A MAN SHOULD LIE IN WAIT FOR AND FOLLOW A VERY HANDSOME
WOMAN IS NO UNHEARD OF THING AND IF HE HAS SO LITTLE AUDACITY THAT HE
NOT ONLY DARED NOT ADDRESS HER BUT EVEN FLED FROM HER APPROACH HE
WAS NOT A VERY FORMIDABLE ASSAILANT
THE RUFFIAN WOODLEY WAS A VERY
DIFFERENT PERSON BUT EXCEPT ON ONE OCCASION HE HAD NOT MOLESTED OUR
CLIENT AND NOW HE VISITED THE HOUSE OF CARRUTHERS WITHOUT INTRUDING
UPON HER PRESENCE
THE MAN ON THE BICYCLE WAS DOUBTLESS A MEMBER OF
THOSE WEEK END PARTIES AT THE HALL OF WHICH THE PUBLICAN HAD SPOKEN
BUT WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE WANTED WAS AS OBSCURE AS EVER
IT WAS THE
SEVERITY OF HOLMES'S MANNER AND THE FACT THAT HE SLIPPED A REVOLVER INTO
HIS POCKET BEFORE LEAVING OUR ROOMS WHICH IMPRESSED ME WITH THE FEELING
THAT TRAGEDY MIGHT PROVE TO LURK BEHIND THIS CURIOUS TRAIN OF EVENTS
A RAINY NIGHT HAD BEEN FOLLOWED BY A GLORIOUS MORNING AND THE
HEATH COVERED COUNTRYSIDE WITH THE GLOWING CLUMPS OF FLOWERING GORSE
SEEMED ALL THE MORE BEAUTIFUL TO EYES WHICH WERE WEARY OF THE DUNS AND
DRABS AND SLATE GRAYS OF LONDON
HOLMES AND I WALKED ALONG THE BROAD
SANDY ROAD INHALING THE FRESH MORNING AIR AND REJOICING IN THE MUSIC OF
THE BIRDS AND THE FRESH BREATH OF THE SPRING
FROM A RISE OF THE ROAD
ON THE SHOULDER OF CROOKSBURY HILL WE COULD SEE THE GRIM HALL BRISTLING
OUT FROM AMIDST THE ANCIENT OAKS WHICH OLD AS THEY WERE WERE STILL
YOUNGER THAN THE BUILDING WHICH THEY SURROUNDED
HOLMES POINTED DOWN THE
LONG TRACT OF ROAD WHICH WOUND A REDDISH YELLOW BAND BETWEEN THE BROWN
OF THE HEATH AND THE BUDDING GREEN OF THE WOODS
FAR AWAY A BLACK
DOT WE COULD SEE A VEHICLE MOVING IN OUR DIRECTION
HOLMES GAVE AN
EXCLAMATION OF IMPATIENCE
I HAVE GIVEN A MARGIN OF HALF AN HOUR SAID HE
IF THAT IS HER TRAP
SHE MUST BE MAKING FOR THE EARLIER TRAIN
I FEAR WATSON THAT SHE WILL
BE PAST CHARLINGTON BEFORE WE CAN POSSIBLY MEET HER
FROM THE INSTANT THAT WE PASSED THE RISE WE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE
VEHICLE BUT WE HASTENED ONWARD AT SUCH A PACE THAT MY SEDENTARY LIFE
BEGAN TO TELL UPON ME AND I WAS COMPELLED TO FALL BEHIND
HOLMES
HOWEVER WAS ALWAYS IN TRAINING FOR HE HAD INEXHAUSTIBLE STORES OF
NERVOUS ENERGY UPON WHICH TO DRAW
HIS SPRINGY STEP NEVER SLOWED UNTIL
SUDDENLY WHEN HE WAS A HUNDRED YARDS IN FRONT OF ME HE HALTED AND I
SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HAND WITH A GESTURE OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR
AT THE
SAME INSTANT AN EMPTY DOG CART THE HORSE CANTERING THE REINS TRAILING
APPEARED ROUND THE CURVE OF THE ROAD AND RATTLED SWIFTLY TOWARDS US
TOO LATE WATSON TOO LATE CRIED HOLMES AS I RAN PANTING TO HIS
SIDE
FOOL THAT I WAS NOT TO ALLOW FOR THAT EARLIER TRAIN IT'S
ABDUCTION WATSON ABDUCTION MURDER HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT BLOCK THE ROAD
STOP THE HORSE THAT'S RIGHT
NOW JUMP IN AND LET US SEE IF I CAN
REPAIR THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY OWN BLUNDER
WE HAD SPRUNG INTO THE DOG CART AND HOLMES AFTER TURNING THE HORSE
GAVE IT A SHARP CUT WITH THE WHIP AND WE FLEW BACK ALONG THE ROAD
AS
WE TURNED THE CURVE THE WHOLE STRETCH OF ROAD BETWEEN THE HALL AND THE
HEATH WAS OPENED UP
I GRASPED HOLMES'S ARM
THAT'S THE MAN I GASPED
A SOLITARY CYCLIST WAS COMING TOWARDS US
HIS HEAD WAS DOWN AND HIS SHOULDERS ROUNDED AS HE PUT EVERY OUNCE OF
ENERGY THAT HE POSSESSED ON TO THE PEDALS
HE WAS FLYING LIKE A RACER
SUDDENLY HE RAISED HIS BEARDED FACE SAW US CLOSE TO HIM AND PULLED
UP SPRINGING FROM HIS MACHINE
THAT COAL BLACK BEARD WAS IN SINGULAR
CONTRAST TO EYES WERE AS BRIGHT AS IF HE HAD A FEVER
HE STARED AT US
AND AT THE DOG CART
THEN A LOOK OF AMAZEMENT CAME OVER HIS FACE
HALLOA STOP THERE HE SHOUTED HOLDING HIS BICYCLE TO BLOCK OUR ROAD
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT DOG CART PULL UP MAN HE YELLED DRAWING A
PISTOL FROM HIS SIDE PULL UP I SAY OR BY GEORGE I'LL PUT A BULLET
INTO YOUR HORSE
HOLMES THREW THE REINS INTO MY LAP AND SPRANG DOWN FROM THE CART
YOU'RE THE MAN WE WANT TO SEE
WHERE IS MISS VIOLET SMITH HE SAID IN
HIS QUICK CLEAR WAY
THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU
YOU'RE IN HER DOG CART
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
WHERE SHE IS
WE MET THE DOG CART ON THE ROAD
THERE WAS NO ONE IN IT
WE DROVE BACK
TO HELP THE YOUNG LADY
GOOD LORD GOOD LORD WHAT SHALL I DO CRIED THE STRANGER IN AN
ECSTASY OF DESPAIR
THEY'VE GOT HER THAT HELL HOUND WOODLEY AND THE
BLACKGUARD PARSON
COME MAN COME IF YOU REALLY ARE HER FRIEND
STAND
BY ME AND WE'LL SAVE HER IF I HAVE TO LEAVE MY CARCASS IN CHARLINGTON
WOOD
HE RAN DISTRACTEDLY HIS PISTOL IN HIS HAND TOWARDS A GAP IN THE HEDGE
HOLMES FOLLOWED HIM AND I LEAVING THE HORSE GRAZING BESIDE THE ROAD
FOLLOWED HOLMES
THIS IS WHERE THEY CAME THROUGH SAID HE POINTING TO THE MARKS OF
SEVERAL FEET UPON THE MUDDY PATH
HALLOA STOP A MINUTE WHO'S THIS IN
THE BUSH
IT WAS A YOUNG FELLOW ABOUT SEVENTEEN DRESSED LIKE AN OSTLER WITH
LEATHER CORDS AND GAITERS
HE LAY UPON HIS BACK HIS KNEES DRAWN UP A
TERRIBLE CUT UPON HIS HEAD
HE WAS INSENSIBLE BUT ALIVE
A GLANCE AT
HIS WOUND TOLD ME THAT IT HAD NOT PENETRATED THE BONE
THAT'S PETER THE GROOM CRIED THE STRANGER
HE DROVE HER
THE BEASTS
HAVE PULLED HIM OFF AND CLUBBED HIM
LET HIM LIE WE CAN'T DO HIM ANY
GOOD BUT WE MAY SAVE HER FROM THE WORST FATE THAT CAN BEFALL A WOMAN
WE RAN FRANTICALLY DOWN THE PATH WHICH WOUND AMONG THE TREES
WE HAD
REACHED THE SHRUBBERY WHICH SURROUNDED THE HOUSE WHEN HOLMES PULLED UP
THEY DIDN'T GO TO THE HOUSE
HERE ARE THEIR MARKS ON THE LEFT HERE
BESIDE THE LAUREL BUSHES
AH I SAID SO
AS HE SPOKE A WOMAN'S SHRILL SCREAM A SCREAM WHICH VIBRATED WITH A
FRENZY OF HORROR BURST FROM THE THICK GREEN CLUMP OF BUSHES IN FRONT
OF US
IT ENDED SUDDENLY ON ITS HIGHEST NOTE WITH A CHOKE AND A GURGLE
THIS WAY THIS WAY THEY ARE IN THE BOWLING ALLEY CRIED THE
STRANGER DARTING THROUGH THE BUSHES
AH THE COWARDLY DOGS FOLLOW ME
GENTLEMEN TOO LATE TOO LATE BY THE LIVING JINGO
WE HAD BROKEN SUDDENLY INTO A LOVELY GLADE OF GREENSWARD SURROUNDED BY
ANCIENT TREES
ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF IT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A MIGHTY
OAK THERE STOOD A SINGULAR GROUP OF THREE PEOPLE
ONE WAS A WOMAN OUR
CLIENT DROOPING AND FAINT A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND HER MOUTH
OPPOSITE HER
STOOD A BRUTAL HEAVY FACED RED MOUSTACHED YOUNG MAN HIS GAITERED LEGS
PARTED WIDE ONE ARM AKIMBO THE OTHER WAVING A RIDING CROP HIS WHOLE
ATTITUDE SUGGESTIVE OF TRIUMPHANT BRAVADO
BETWEEN THEM AN ELDERLY
GRAY BEARDED MAN WEARING A SHORT SURPLICE OVER A LIGHT TWEED SUIT
HAD EVIDENTLY JUST COMPLETED THE WEDDING SERVICE FOR HE POCKETED HIS
PRAYER BOOK AS WE APPEARED AND SLAPPED THE SINISTER BRIDEGROOM UPON THE
BACK IN JOVIAL CONGRATULATION
THEY'RE MARRIED I GASPED
COME ON CRIED OUR GUIDE COME ON HE RUSHED ACROSS THE GLADE
HOLMES AND I AT HIS HEELS
AS WE APPROACHED THE LADY STAGGERED AGAINST
THE TRUNK OF THE TREE FOR SUPPORT
WILLIAMSON THE EX CLERGYMAN BOWED
TO US WITH MOCK POLITENESS AND THE BULLY WOODLEY ADVANCED WITH A
SHOUT OF BRUTAL AND EXULTANT LAUGHTER
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR BEARD OFF BOB SAID HE
I KNOW YOU RIGHT ENOUGH
WELL YOU AND YOUR PALS HAVE JUST COME IN TIME FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO MRS
WOODLEY
OUR GUIDE'S ANSWER WAS A SINGULAR ONE
HE SNATCHED OFF THE DARK BEARD
WHICH HAD DISGUISED HIM AND THREW IT ON THE GROUND DISCLOSING A LONG
SALLOW CLEAN SHAVEN FACE BELOW IT
THEN HE RAISED HIS REVOLVER AND
COVERED THE YOUNG RUFFIAN WHO WAS ADVANCING UPON HIM WITH HIS DANGEROUS
RIDING CROP SWINGING IN HIS HAND
YES SAID OUR ALLY I AM BOB CARRUTHERS AND I'LL SEE THIS WOMAN
RIGHTED IF I HAVE TO SWING FOR IT
I TOLD YOU WHAT I'D DO IF YOU
MOLESTED HER AND BY THE LORD I'LL BE AS GOOD AS MY WORD
YOU'RE TOO LATE
SHE'S MY WIFE
NO SHE'S YOUR WIDOW
HIS REVOLVER CRACKED AND I SAW THE BLOOD SPURT FROM THE FRONT OF
WOODLEY'S WAISTCOAT
HE SPUN ROUND WITH A SCREAM AND FELL UPON HIS BACK
HIS HIDEOUS RED FACE TURNING SUDDENLY TO A DREADFUL MOTTLED PALLOR
THE
OLD MAN STILL CLAD IN HIS SURPLICE BURST INTO SUCH A STRING OF FOUL
OATHS AS I HAVE NEVER HEARD AND PULLED OUT A REVOLVER OF HIS OWN BUT
BEFORE HE COULD RAISE IT HE WAS LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF HOLMES'S
WEAPON
ENOUGH OF THIS SAID MY FRIEND COLDLY
DROP THAT PISTOL WATSON
PICK IT UP HOLD IT TO HIS HEAD
THANK YOU
YOU CARRUTHERS GIVE ME
THAT REVOLVER
WE'LL HAVE NO MORE VIOLENCE
COME HAND IT OVER
WHO ARE YOU THEN
MY NAME IS SHERLOCK HOLMES
GOOD LORD
YOU HAVE HEARD OF ME I SEE
I WILL REPRESENT THE OFFICIAL POLICE UNTIL
THEIR ARRIVAL
HERE YOU HE SHOUTED TO A FRIGHTENED GROOM WHO HAD
APPEARED AT THE EDGE OF THE GLADE
COME HERE
TAKE THIS NOTE AS HARD AS
YOU CAN RIDE TO FARNHAM HE SCRIBBLED A FEW WORDS UPON A LEAF FROM HIS
NOTEBOOK
GIVE IT TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AT THE POLICE STATION
UNTIL HE
COMES I MUST DETAIN YOU ALL UNDER MY PERSONAL CUSTODY
THE STRONG MASTERFUL PERSONALITY OF HOLMES DOMINATED THE TRAGIC SCENE
AND ALL WERE EQUALLY PUPPETS IN HIS HANDS
WILLIAMSON AND CARRUTHERS
FOUND THEMSELVES CARRYING THE WOUNDED WOODLEY INTO THE HOUSE AND I GAVE
MY ARM TO THE FRIGHTENED GIRL
THE INJURED MAN WAS LAID ON HIS BED AND
AT HOLMES'S REQUEST I EXAMINED HIM
I CARRIED MY REPORT TO WHERE HE SAT
IN THE OLD TAPESTRY HUNG DINING ROOM WITH HIS TWO PRISONERS BEFORE HIM
HE WILL LIVE SAID I
WHAT CRIED CARRUTHERS SPRINGING OUT OF HIS CHAIR
I'LL GO UPSTAIRS
AND FINISH HIM FIRST
DO YOU TELL ME THAT THAT ANGEL IS TO BE TIED TO
ROARING JACK WOODLEY FOR LIFE
YOU NEED NOT CONCERN YOURSELF ABOUT THAT SAID HOLMES
THERE ARE TWO
VERY GOOD REASONS WHY SHE SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE HIS WIFE
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE ARE VERY SAFE IN QUESTIONING MR
WILLIAMSON'S
RIGHT TO SOLEMNIZE A MARRIAGE
I HAVE BEEN ORDAINED CRIED THE OLD RASCAL
AND ALSO UNFROCKED
ONCE A CLERGYMAN ALWAYS A CLERGYMAN
I THINK NOT
HOW ABOUT THE LICENSE
WE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE MARRIAGE
I HAVE IT HERE IN MY POCKET
THEN YOU GOT IT BY TRICK
BUT IN ANY CASE A FORCED MARRIAGE IS NO
MARRIAGE BUT IT IS A VERY SERIOUS FELONY AS YOU WILL DISCOVER BEFORE
YOU HAVE FINISHED
YOU'LL HAVE TIME TO THINK THE POINT OUT DURING THE
NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN
AS TO YOU CARRUTHERS YOU
WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO KEEP YOUR PISTOL IN YOUR POCKET
I BEGIN TO THINK SO MR
HOLMES BUT WHEN I THOUGHT OF ALL THE
PRECAUTION I HAD TAKEN TO SHIELD THIS GIRL FOR I LOVED HER MR
HOLMES
AND IT IS THE ONLY TIME THAT EVER I KNEW WHAT LOVE WAS IT FAIRLY DROVE
ME MAD TO THINK THAT SHE WAS IN THE POWER OF THE GREATEST BRUTE AND
BULLY IN SOUTH AFRICA A MAN WHOSE NAME IS A HOLY TERROR FROM KIMBERLEY
TO JOHANNESBURG
WHY MR
HOLMES YOU'LL HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT EVER
SINCE THAT GIRL HAS BEEN IN MY EMPLOYMENT I NEVER ONCE LET HER GO PAST
THIS HOUSE WHERE I KNEW THE RASCALS WERE LURKING WITHOUT FOLLOWING HER
ON MY BICYCLE JUST TO SEE THAT SHE CAME TO NO HARM
I KEPT MY DISTANCE
FROM HER AND I WORE A BEARD SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT RECOGNIZE ME FOR
SHE IS A GOOD AND HIGH SPIRITED GIRL AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE STAYED IN
MY EMPLOYMENT LONG IF SHE HAD THOUGHT THAT I WAS FOLLOWING HER ABOUT THE
COUNTRY ROADS
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER OF HER DANGER
BECAUSE THEN AGAIN SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT ME AND I COULDN'T BEAR TO
FACE THAT
EVEN IF SHE COULDN'T LOVE ME IT WAS A GREAT DEAL TO ME JUST
TO SEE HER DAINTY FORM ABOUT THE HOUSE AND TO HEAR THE SOUND OF HER
VOICE
WELL SAID I YOU CALL THAT LOVE MR
CARRUTHERS BUT I SHOULD CALL
IT SELFISHNESS
MAYBE THE TWO THINGS GO TOGETHER
ANYHOW I COULDN'T LET HER GO
BESIDES WITH THIS CROWD ABOUT IT WAS WELL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE
NEAR TO LOOK AFTER HER
THEN WHEN THE CABLE CAME I KNEW THEY WERE
BOUND TO MAKE A MOVE
WHAT CABLE
CARRUTHERS TOOK A TELEGRAM FROM HIS POCKET THAT'S IT SAID HE
IT WAS SHORT AND CONCISE
THE OLD MAN IS DEAD
HUM SAID HOLMES
I THINK I SEE HOW THINGS WORKED AND I CAN
UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MESSAGE WOULD AS YOU SAY BRING THEM TO A HEAD
BUT
WHILE YOU WAIT YOU MIGHT TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN
THE OLD REPROBATE WITH THE SURPLICE BURST INTO A VOLLEY OF BAD LANGUAGE
BY HEAVEN SAID HE IF YOU SQUEAL ON US BOB CARRUTHERS I'LL SERVE
YOU AS YOU SERVED JACK WOODLEY
YOU CAN BLEAT ABOUT THE GIRL TO YOUR
HEART'S CONTENT FOR THAT'S YOUR OWN AFFAIR BUT IF YOU ROUND ON YOUR
PALS TO THIS PLAIN CLOTHES COPPER IT WILL BE THE WORST DAY'S WORK THAT
EVER YOU DID
YOUR REVERENCE NEED NOT BE EXCITED SAID HOLMES LIGHTING A CIGARETTE
THE CASE IS CLEAR ENOUGH AGAINST YOU AND ALL I ASK IS A FEW DETAILS
FOR MY PRIVATE CURIOSITY
HOWEVER IF THERE'S ANY DIFFICULTY IN YOUR
TELLING ME I'LL DO THE TALKING AND THEN YOU WILL SEE HOW FAR YOU HAVE
A CHANCE OF HOLDING BACK YOUR SECRETS
IN THE FIRST PLACE THREE OF YOU
CAME FROM SOUTH AFRICA ON THIS GAME YOU WILLIAMSON YOU CARRUTHERS AND
WOODLEY
LIE NUMBER ONE SAID THE OLD MAN I NEVER SAW EITHER OF THEM UNTIL
TWO MONTHS AGO AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AFRICA IN MY LIFE SO YOU CAN
PUT THAT IN YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT MR
BUSYBODY HOLMES
WHAT HE SAYS IS TRUE SAID CARRUTHERS
WELL WELL TWO OF YOU CAME OVER
HIS REVERENCE IS OUR OWN HOMEMADE
ARTICLE
YOU HAD KNOWN RALPH SMITH IN SOUTH AFRICA
YOU HAD REASON
TO BELIEVE HE WOULD NOT LIVE LONG
YOU FOUND OUT THAT HIS NIECE WOULD
INHERIT HIS FORTUNE
HOW'S THAT EH
CARRUTHERS NODDED AND WILLIAMSON SWORE
SHE WAS NEXT OF KIN NO DOUBT AND YOU WERE AWARE THAT THE OLD FELLOW
WOULD MAKE NO WILL
COULDN'T READ OR WRITE SAID CARRUTHERS
SO YOU CAME OVER THE TWO OF YOU AND HUNTED UP THE GIRL
THE IDEA
WAS THAT ONE OF YOU WAS TO MARRY HER AND THE OTHER HAVE A SHARE OF THE
PLUNDER
FOR SOME REASON WOODLEY WAS CHOSEN AS THE HUSBAND
WHY WAS
THAT
WE PLAYED CARDS FOR HER ON THE VOYAGE
HE WON
I SEE
YOU GOT THE YOUNG LADY INTO YOUR SERVICE AND THERE WOODLEY WAS
TO DO THE COURTING
SHE RECOGNIZED THE DRUNKEN BRUTE THAT HE WAS AND
WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM
MEANWHILE YOUR ARRANGEMENT WAS
RATHER UPSET BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE
LADY
YOU COULD NO LONGER BEAR THE IDEA OF THIS RUFFIAN OWNING HER
NO BY GEORGE I COULDN'T
THERE WAS A QUARREL BETWEEN YOU
HE LEFT YOU IN A RAGE AND BEGAN TO
MAKE HIS OWN PLANS INDEPENDENTLY OF YOU
IT STRIKES ME WILLIAMSON THERE ISN'T VERY MUCH THAT WE CAN TELL THIS
GENTLEMAN CRIED CARRUTHERS WITH A BITTER LAUGH
YES WE QUARRELED
AND HE KNOCKED ME DOWN
I AM LEVEL WITH HIM ON THAT ANYHOW
THEN I LOST
SIGHT OF HIM
THAT WAS WHEN HE PICKED UP WITH THIS OUTCAST PADRE HERE
I FOUND THAT THEY HAD SET UP HOUSEKEEPING TOGETHER AT THIS PLACE ON THE
LINE THAT SHE HAD TO PASS FOR THE STATION
I KEPT MY EYE ON HER AFTER
THAT FOR I KNEW THERE WAS SOME DEVILRY IN THE WIND
I SAW THEM FROM
TIME TO TIME FOR I WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER
TWO DAYS
AGO WOODLEY CAME UP TO MY HOUSE WITH THIS CABLE WHICH SHOWED THAT RALPH
SMITH WAS DEAD
HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD STAND BY THE BARGAIN
I SAID I
WOULD NOT
HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD MARRY THE GIRL MYSELF AND GIVE HIM A
SHARE
I SAID I WOULD WILLINGLY DO SO BUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ME
HE SAID 'LET US GET HER MARRIED FIRST AND AFTER A WEEK OR TWO SHE MAY
SEE THINGS A BIT DIFFERENT I SAID I WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
VIOLENCE
SO HE WENT OFF CURSING LIKE THE FOUL MOUTHED BLACKGUARD THAT
HE WAS AND SWEARING THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER YET
SHE WAS LEAVING ME THIS
WEEK END AND I HAD GOT A TRAP TO TAKE HER TO THE STATION BUT I WAS
SO UNEASY IN MY MIND THAT I FOLLOWED HER ON MY BICYCLE
SHE HAD GOT A
START HOWEVER AND BEFORE I COULD CATCH HER THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE
THE FIRST THING I KNEW ABOUT IT WAS WHEN I SAW YOU TWO GENTLEMEN DRIVING
BACK IN HER DOG CART
HOLMES ROSE AND TOSSED THE END OF HIS CIGARETTE INTO THE GRATE
I HAVE
BEEN VERY OBTUSE WATSON SAID HE
WHEN IN YOUR REPORT YOU SAID THAT
YOU HAD SEEN THE CYCLIST AS YOU THOUGHT ARRANGE HIS NECKTIE IN
THE SHRUBBERY THAT ALONE SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ALL
HOWEVER WE MAY
CONGRATULATE OURSELVES UPON A CURIOUS AND IN SOME RESPECTS A UNIQUE
CASE
I PERCEIVE THREE OF THE COUNTY CONSTABULARY IN THE DRIVE AND I AM
GLAD TO SEE THAT THE LITTLE OSTLER IS ABLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THEM SO
IT IS LIKELY THAT NEITHER HE NOR THE INTERESTING BRIDEGROOM WILL BE
PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY THEIR MORNING'S ADVENTURES
I THINK WATSON THAT
IN YOUR MEDICAL CAPACITY YOU MIGHT WAIT UPON MISS SMITH AND TELL HER
THAT IF SHE IS SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED WE SHALL BE HAPPY TO ESCORT HER
TO HER MOTHER'S HOME
IF SHE IS NOT QUITE CONVALESCENT YOU WILL FIND
THAT A HINT THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO TELEGRAPH TO A YOUNG ELECTRICIAN
IN THE MIDLANDS WOULD PROBABLY COMPLETE THE CURE
AS TO YOU MR
CARRUTHERS I THINK THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO MAKE AMENDS FOR
YOUR SHARE IN AN EVIL PLOT
THERE IS MY CARD SIR AND IF MY EVIDENCE
CAN BE OF HELP IN YOUR TRIAL IT SHALL BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
IN THE WHIRL OF OUR INCESSANT ACTIVITY IT HAS OFTEN BEEN DIFFICULT FOR
ME AS THE READER HAS PROBABLY OBSERVED TO ROUND OFF MY NARRATIVES AND
TO GIVE THOSE FINAL DETAILS WHICH THE CURIOUS MIGHT EXPECT
EACH CASE
HAS BEEN THE PRELUDE TO ANOTHER AND THE CRISIS ONCE OVER THE ACTORS
HAVE PASSED FOR EVER OUT OF OUR BUSY LIVES
I FIND HOWEVER A SHORT
NOTE AT THE END OF MY MANUSCRIPT DEALING WITH THIS CASE IN WHICH I HAVE
PUT IT UPON RECORD THAT MISS VIOLET SMITH DID INDEED INHERIT A LARGE
FORTUNE AND THAT SHE IS NOW THE WIFE OF CYRIL MORTON THE SENIOR
PARTNER OF MORTON KENNEDY THE FAMOUS WESTMINSTER ELECTRICIANS
WILLIAMSON AND WOODLEY WERE BOTH TRIED FOR ABDUCTION AND ASSAULT THE
FORMER GETTING SEVEN YEARS THE LATTER TEN
OF THE FATE OF CARRUTHERS
I HAVE NO RECORD BUT I AM SURE THAT HIS ASSAULT WAS NOT VIEWED VERY
GRAVELY BY THE COURT SINCE WOODLEY HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING A MOST
DANGEROUS RUFFIAN AND I THINK THAT A FEW MONTHS WERE SUFFICIENT TO
SATISFY THE DEMANDS OF JUSTICE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL
WE HAVE HAD SOME DRAMATIC ENTRANCES AND EXITS UPON OUR SMALL STAGE AT
BAKER STREET BUT I CANNOT RECOLLECT ANYTHING MORE SUDDEN AND STARTLING
THAN THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF THORNEYCROFT HUXTABLE M A PH D ETC
HIS CARD WHICH SEEMED TOO SMALL TO CARRY THE WEIGHT OF HIS ACADEMIC
DISTINCTIONS PRECEDED HIM BY A FEW SECONDS AND THEN HE ENTERED
HIMSELF SO LARGE SO POMPOUS AND SO DIGNIFIED THAT HE WAS THE VERY
EMBODIMENT OF SELF POSSESSION AND SOLIDITY
AND YET HIS FIRST ACTION
WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED BEHIND HIM WAS TO STAGGER AGAINST THE TABLE
WHENCE HE SLIPPED DOWN UPON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS THAT MAJESTIC
FIGURE PROSTRATE AND INSENSIBLE UPON OUR BEARSKIN HEARTH RUG
WE HAD SPRUNG TO OUR FEET AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS WE STARED IN SILENT
AMAZEMENT AT THIS PONDEROUS PIECE OF WRECKAGE WHICH TOLD OF SOME SUDDEN
AND FATAL STORM FAR OUT ON THE OCEAN OF LIFE
THEN HOLMES HURRIED WITH
A CUSHION FOR HIS HEAD AND I WITH BRANDY FOR HIS LIPS
THE HEAVY WHITE
FACE WAS SEAMED WITH LINES OF TROUBLE THE HANGING POUCHES UNDER THE
CLOSED EYES WERE LEADEN IN COLOUR THE LOOSE MOUTH DROOPED DOLOROUSLY AT
THE CORNERS THE ROLLING CHINS WERE UNSHAVEN
COLLAR AND SHIRT BORE
THE GRIME OF A LONG JOURNEY AND THE HAIR BRISTLED UNKEMPT FROM THE
WELL SHAPED HEAD
IT WAS A SORELY STRICKEN MAN WHO LAY BEFORE US
WHAT IS IT WATSON ASKED HOLMES
ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION POSSIBLY MERE HUNGER AND FATIGUE SAID I WITH MY
FINGER ON THE THREADY PULSE WHERE THE STREAM OF LIFE TRICKLED THIN AND
SMALL
RETURN TICKET FROM MACKLETON IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND SAID HOLMES
DRAWING IT FROM THE WATCH POCKET
IT IS NOT TWELVE O'CLOCK YET
HE HAS
CERTAINLY BEEN AN EARLY STARTER
THE PUCKERED EYELIDS HAD BEGUN TO QUIVER AND NOW A PAIR OF VACANT GRAY
EYES LOOKED UP AT US
AN INSTANT LATER THE MAN HAD SCRAMBLED ON TO HIS
FEET HIS FACE CRIMSON WITH SHAME
FORGIVE THIS WEAKNESS MR
HOLMES I HAVE BEEN A LITTLE OVERWROUGHT
THANK YOU IF I MIGHT HAVE A GLASS OF MILK AND A BISCUIT I HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT I SHOULD BE BETTER
I CAME PERSONALLY MR
HOLMES IN ORDER
TO INSURE THAT YOU WOULD RETURN WITH ME
I FEARED THAT NO TELEGRAM WOULD
CONVINCE YOU OF THE ABSOLUTE URGENCY OF THE CASE
WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RESTORED
I AM QUITE WELL AGAIN
I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW I CAME TO BE SO WEAK
I
WISH YOU MR
HOLMES TO COME TO MACKLETON WITH ME BY THE NEXT TRAIN
MY FRIEND SHOOK HIS HEAD
MY COLLEAGUE DR
WATSON COULD TELL YOU THAT WE ARE VERY BUSY AT
PRESENT
I AM RETAINED IN THIS CASE OF THE FERRERS DOCUMENTS AND THE
ABERGAVENNY MURDER IS COMING UP FOR TRIAL
ONLY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE
COULD CALL ME FROM LONDON AT PRESENT
IMPORTANT OUR VISITOR THREW UP HIS HANDS
HAVE YOU HEARD NOTHING OF
THE ABDUCTION OF THE ONLY SON OF THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE
WHAT THE LATE CABINET MINISTER
EXACTLY
WE HAD TRIED TO KEEP IT OUT OF THE PAPERS BUT THERE WAS SOME
RUMOR IN THE GLOBE LAST NIGHT
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE REACHED YOUR
EARS
HOLMES SHOT OUT HIS LONG THIN ARM AND PICKED OUT VOLUME H IN HIS
ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF REFERENCE
'HOLDERNESSE 6TH DUKE K G P C HALF THE ALPHABET 'BARON
BEVERLEY EARL OF CARSTON' DEAR ME WHAT A LIST 'LORD LIEUTENANT
OF HALLAMSHIRE SINCE 1900
MARRIED EDITH DAUGHTER OF SIR CHARLES
APPLEDORE 1888
HEIR AND ONLY CHILD LORD SALTIRE
OWNS ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES
MINERALS IN LANCASHIRE AND WALES
ADDRESS CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE HOLDERNESSE HALL HALLAMSHIRE CARSTON
CASTLE BANGOR WALES
LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY 1872 CHIEF SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR WELL WELL THIS MAN IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE GREATEST
SUBJECTS OF THE CROWN
THE GREATEST AND PERHAPS THE WEALTHIEST
I AM AWARE MR
HOLMES THAT
YOU TAKE A VERY HIGH LINE IN PROFESSIONAL MATTERS AND THAT YOU ARE
PREPARED TO WORK FOR THE WORK'S SAKE
I MAY TELL YOU HOWEVER THAT HIS
GRACE HAS ALREADY INTIMATED THAT A CHECK FOR FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WILL
BE HANDED OVER TO THE PERSON WHO CAN TELL HIM WHERE HIS SON IS AND
ANOTHER THOUSAND TO HIM WHO CAN NAME THE MAN OR MEN WHO HAVE TAKEN HIM
IT IS A PRINCELY OFFER SAID HOLMES
WATSON I THINK THAT WE SHALL
ACCOMPANY DR
HUXTABLE BACK TO THE NORTH OF ENGLAND
AND NOW DR
HUXTABLE WHEN YOU HAVE CONSUMED THAT MILK YOU WILL KINDLY TELL ME WHAT
HAS HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED HOW IT HAPPENED AND FINALLY WHAT DR
THORNEYCROFT HUXTABLE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL NEAR MACKLETON HAS TO DO
WITH THE MATTER AND WHY HE COMES THREE DAYS AFTER AN EVENT THE STATE
OF YOUR CHIN GIVES THE DATE TO ASK FOR MY HUMBLE SERVICES
OUR VISITOR HAD CONSUMED HIS MILK AND BISCUITS
THE LIGHT HAD COME BACK
TO HIS EYES AND THE COLOUR TO HIS CHEEKS AS HE SET HIMSELF WITH GREAT
VIGOUR AND LUCIDITY TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION
I MUST INFORM YOU GENTLEMEN THAT THE PRIORY IS A PREPARATORY SCHOOL
OF WHICH I AM THE FOUNDER AND PRINCIPAL
HUXTABLE'S SIDELIGHTS ON HORACE
MAY POSSIBLY RECALL MY NAME TO YOUR MEMORIES
THE PRIORY IS WITHOUT
EXCEPTION THE BEST AND MOST SELECT PREPARATORY SCHOOL IN ENGLAND
LORD
LEVERSTOKE THE EARL OF BLACKWATER SIR CATHCART SOAMES THEY ALL HAVE
INTRUSTED THEIR SONS TO ME
BUT I FELT THAT MY SCHOOL HAD REACHED ITS
ZENITH WHEN WEEKS AGO THE DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE SENT MR
JAMES WILDER
HIS SECRETARY WITH INTIMATION THAT YOUNG LORD SALTIRE TEN YEARS OLD
HIS ONLY SON AND HEIR WAS ABOUT TO BE COMMITTED TO MY CHARGE
LITTLE
DID I THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE THE PRELUDE TO THE MOST CRUSHING
MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE
ON MAY 1ST THE BOY ARRIVED THAT BEING THE BEGINNING OF THE SUMMER
TERM
HE WAS A CHARMING YOUTH AND HE SOON FELL INTO OUR WAYS
I MAY
TELL YOU I TRUST THAT I AM NOT INDISCREET BUT HALF CONFIDENCES ARE
ABSURD IN SUCH A CASE THAT HE WAS NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY AT HOME
IT IS AN
OPEN SECRET THAT THE DUKE'S MARRIED LIFE HAD NOT BEEN A PEACEFUL ONE
AND THE MATTER HAD ENDED IN A SEPARATION BY MUTUAL CONSENT THE DUCHESS
TAKING UP HER RESIDENCE IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
THIS HAD OCCURRED VERY
SHORTLY BEFORE AND THE BOY'S SYMPATHIES ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN STRONGLY
WITH HIS MOTHER
HE MOPED AFTER HER DEPARTURE FROM HOLDERNESSE HALL
AND IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE DUKE DESIRED TO SEND HIM TO MY
ESTABLISHMENT
IN A FORTNIGHT THE BOY WAS QUITE AT HOME WITH US AND WAS
APPARENTLY ABSOLUTELY HAPPY
HE WAS LAST SEEN ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 13TH THAT IS THE NIGHT OF LAST
MONDAY
HIS ROOM WAS ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND WAS APPROACHED THROUGH
ANOTHER LARGER ROOM IN WHICH TWO BOYS WERE SLEEPING
THESE BOYS SAW AND
HEARD NOTHING SO THAT IT IS CERTAIN THAT YOUNG SALTIRE DID NOT PASS OUT
THAT WAY
HIS WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THERE IS A STOUT IVY PLANT LEADING TO
THE GROUND
WE COULD TRACE NO FOOTMARKS BELOW BUT IT IS SURE THAT THIS
IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXIT
HIS ABSENCE WAS DISCOVERED AT SEVEN O'CLOCK ON TUESDAY MORNING
HIS BED
HAD BEEN SLEPT IN
HE HAD DRESSED HIMSELF FULLY BEFORE GOING OFF IN
HIS USUAL SCHOOL SUIT OF BLACK ETON JACKET AND DARK GRAY TROUSERS
THERE
WERE NO SIGNS THAT ANYONE HAD ENTERED THE ROOM AND IT IS QUITE CERTAIN
THAT ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF CRIES OR A STRUGGLE WOULD HAVE BEEN
HEARD SINCE CAUNTER THE ELDER BOY IN THE INNER ROOM IS A VERY LIGHT
SLEEPER
WHEN LORD SALTIRE'S DISAPPEARANCE WAS DISCOVERED I AT ONCE CALLED A
ROLL OF THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT BOYS MASTERS AND SERVANTS
IT WAS
THEN THAT WE ASCERTAINED THAT LORD SALTIRE HAD NOT BEEN ALONE IN HIS
FLIGHT
HEIDEGGER THE GERMAN MASTER WAS MISSING
HIS ROOM WAS ON THE
SECOND FLOOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE BUILDING FACING THE SAME WAY
AS LORD SALTIRE'S
HIS BED HAD ALSO BEEN SLEPT IN BUT HE HAD APPARENTLY
GONE AWAY PARTLY DRESSED SINCE HIS SHIRT AND SOCKS WERE LYING ON THE
FLOOR
HE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY LET HIMSELF DOWN BY THE IVY FOR WE COULD SEE
THE MARKS OF HIS FEET WHERE HE HAD LANDED ON THE LAWN
HIS BICYCLE WAS
KEPT IN A SMALL SHED BESIDE THIS LAWN AND IT ALSO WAS GONE
HE HAD BEEN WITH ME FOR TWO YEARS AND CAME WITH THE BEST REFERENCES
BUT HE WAS A SILENT MOROSE MAN NOT VERY POPULAR EITHER WITH MASTERS
OR BOYS
NO TRACE COULD BE FOUND OF THE FUGITIVES AND NOW ON THURSDAY
MORNING WE ARE AS IGNORANT AS WE WERE ON TUESDAY
INQUIRY WAS OF
COURSE MADE AT ONCE AT HOLDERNESSE HALL
IT IS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY
AND WE IMAGINED THAT IN SOME SUDDEN ATTACK OF HOMESICKNESS HE HAD
GONE BACK TO HIS FATHER BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF HIM
THE DUKE IS
GREATLY AGITATED AND AS TO ME YOU HAVE SEEN YOURSELVES THE STATE OF
NERVOUS PROSTRATION TO WHICH THE SUSPENSE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY HAVE
REDUCED ME
MR
HOLMES IF EVER YOU PUT FORWARD YOUR FULL POWERS I
IMPLORE YOU TO DO SO NOW FOR NEVER IN YOUR LIFE COULD YOU HAVE A CASE
WHICH IS MORE WORTHY OF THEM
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST INTENTNESS TO THE STATEMENT
OF THE UNHAPPY SCHOOLMASTER
HIS DRAWN BROWS AND THE DEEP FURROW
BETWEEN THEM SHOWED THAT HE NEEDED NO EXHORTATION TO CONCENTRATE ALL
HIS ATTENTION UPON A PROBLEM WHICH APART FROM THE TREMENDOUS INTERESTS
INVOLVED MUST APPEAL SO DIRECTLY TO HIS LOVE OF THE COMPLEX AND THE
UNUSUAL
HE NOW DREW OUT HIS NOTEBOOK AND JOTTED DOWN ONE OR TWO
MEMORANDA
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY REMISS IN NOT COMING TO ME SOONER SAID HE
SEVERELY
YOU START ME ON MY INVESTIGATION WITH A VERY SERIOUS
HANDICAP
IT IS INCONCEIVABLE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THIS IVY AND THIS LAWN
WOULD HAVE YIELDED NOTHING TO AN EXPERT OBSERVER
I AM NOT TO BLAME MR
HOLMES
HIS GRACE WAS EXTREMELY DESIROUS TO
AVOID ALL PUBLIC SCANDAL
HE WAS AFRAID OF HIS FAMILY UNHAPPINESS BEING
DRAGGED BEFORE THE WORLD
HE HAS A DEEP HORROR OF ANYTHING OF THE KIND
BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION
YES SIR AND IT HAS PROVED MOST DISAPPOINTING
AN APPARENT CLUE WAS
AT ONCE OBTAINED SINCE A BOY AND A YOUNG MAN WERE REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN
SEEN LEAVING A NEIGHBOURING STATION BY AN EARLY TRAIN
ONLY LAST NIGHT
WE HAD NEWS THAT THE COUPLE HAD BEEN HUNTED DOWN IN LIVERPOOL AND THEY
PROVE TO HAVE NO CONNECTION WHATEVER WITH THE MATTER IN HAND
THEN IT
WAS THAT IN MY DESPAIR AND DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT I
CAME STRAIGHT TO YOU BY THE EARLY TRAIN
I SUPPOSE THE LOCAL INVESTIGATION WAS RELAXED WHILE THIS FALSE CLUE WAS
BEING FOLLOWED UP
IT WAS ENTIRELY DROPPED
SO THAT THREE DAYS HAVE BEEN WASTED
THE AFFAIR HAS BEEN MOST
DEPLORABLY HANDLED
I FEEL IT AND ADMIT IT
AND YET THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF ULTIMATE SOLUTION
I SHALL BE
VERY HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TRACE ANY CONNECTION
BETWEEN THE MISSING BOY AND THIS GERMAN MASTER
NONE AT ALL
WAS HE IN THE MASTER'S CLASS
NO HE NEVER EXCHANGED A WORD WITH HIM SO FAR AS I KNOW
THAT IS CERTAINLY VERY SINGULAR
HAD THE BOY A BICYCLE
NO
WAS ANY OTHER BICYCLE MISSING
NO
IS THAT CERTAIN
QUITE
WELL NOW YOU DO NOT MEAN TO SERIOUSLY SUGGEST THAT THIS GERMAN RODE
OFF UPON A BICYCLE IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT BEARING THE BOY IN HIS
ARMS
CERTAINLY NOT
THEN WHAT IS THE THEORY IN YOUR MIND
THE BICYCLE MAY HAVE BEEN A BLIND
IT MAY HAVE BEEN HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
AND THE PAIR GONE OFF ON FOOT
QUITE SO BUT IT SEEMS RATHER AN ABSURD BLIND DOES IT NOT WERE THERE
OTHER BICYCLES IN THIS SHED
SEVERAL
WOULD HE NOT HAVE HIDDEN A COUPLE HAD HE DESIRED TO GIVE THE IDEA THAT
THEY HAD GONE OFF UPON THEM
I SUPPOSE HE WOULD
OF COURSE HE WOULD
THE BLIND THEORY WON'T DO
BUT THE INCIDENT IS AN
ADMIRABLE STARTING POINT FOR AN INVESTIGATION
AFTER ALL A BICYCLE
IS NOT AN EASY THING TO CONCEAL OR TO DESTROY
ONE OTHER QUESTION
DID
ANYONE CALL TO SEE THE BOY ON THE DAY BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED
NO
DID HE GET ANY LETTERS
YES ONE LETTER
FROM WHOM
FROM HIS FATHER
DO YOU OPEN THE BOYS' LETTERS
NO
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WAS FROM THE FATHER
THE COAT OF ARMS WAS ON THE ENVELOPE AND IT WAS ADDRESSED IN THE
DUKE'S PECULIAR STIFF HAND
BESIDES THE DUKE REMEMBERS HAVING WRITTEN
WHEN HAD HE A LETTER BEFORE THAT
NOT FOR SEVERAL DAYS
HAD HE EVER ONE FROM FRANCE
NO NEVER
YOU SEE THE POINT OF MY QUESTIONS OF COURSE
EITHER THE BOY WAS
CARRIED OFF BY FORCE OR HE WENT OF HIS OWN FREE WILL
IN THE LATTER
CASE YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT SOME PROMPTING FROM OUTSIDE WOULD BE NEEDED
TO MAKE SO YOUNG A LAD DO SUCH A THING
IF HE HAS HAD NO VISITORS THAT
PROMPTING MUST HAVE COME IN LETTERS HENCE I TRY TO FIND OUT WHO WERE
HIS CORRESPONDENTS
I FEAR I CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH
HIS ONLY CORRESPONDENT SO FAR AS I
KNOW WAS HIS OWN FATHER
WHO WROTE TO HIM ON THE VERY DAY OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE
WERE THE
RELATIONS BETWEEN FATHER AND SON VERY FRIENDLY
HIS GRACE IS NEVER VERY FRIENDLY WITH ANYONE
HE IS COMPLETELY IMMERSED
IN LARGE PUBLIC QUESTIONS AND IS RATHER INACCESSIBLE TO ALL ORDINARY
EMOTIONS
BUT HE WAS ALWAYS KIND TO THE BOY IN HIS OWN WAY
BUT THE SYMPATHIES OF THE LATTER WERE WITH THE MOTHER
YES
DID HE SAY SO
NO
THE DUKE THEN
GOOD HEAVEN NO
THEN HOW COULD YOU KNOW
I HAVE HAD SOME CONFIDENTIAL TALKS WITH MR
JAMES WILDER HIS GRACE'S
SECRETARY
IT WAS HE WHO GAVE ME THE INFORMATION ABOUT LORD SALTIRE'S
FEELINGS
I SEE
BY THE WAY THAT LAST LETTER OF THE DUKES WAS IT FOUND IN THE
BOY'S ROOM AFTER HE WAS GONE
NO HE HAD TAKEN IT WITH HIM
I THINK MR
HOLMES IT IS TIME THAT WE
WERE LEAVING FOR EUSTON
I WILL ORDER A FOUR WHEELER
IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE SHALL BE AT
YOUR SERVICE
IF YOU ARE TELEGRAPHING HOME MR
HUXTABLE IT WOULD
BE WELL TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE IN YOUR NEIGHBOURHOOD TO IMAGINE THAT
THE INQUIRY IS STILL GOING ON IN LIVERPOOL OR WHEREVER ELSE THAT RED
HERRING LED YOUR PACK
IN THE MEANTIME I WILL DO A LITTLE QUIET WORK AT
YOUR OWN DOORS AND PERHAPS THE SCENT IS NOT SO COLD BUT THAT TWO OLD
HOUNDS LIKE WATSON AND MYSELF MAY GET A SNIFF OF IT
THAT EVENING FOUND US IN THE COLD BRACING ATMOSPHERE OF THE PEAK
COUNTRY IN WHICH DR
HUXTABLE'S FAMOUS SCHOOL IS SITUATED
IT WAS
ALREADY DARK WHEN WE REACHED IT
A CARD WAS LYING ON THE HALL TABLE
AND THE BUTLER WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HIS MASTER WHO TURNED TO US WITH
AGITATION IN EVERY HEAVY FEATURE
THE DUKE IS HERE SAID HE
THE DUKE AND MR
WILDER ARE IN THE STUDY
COME GENTLEMEN AND I WILL INTRODUCE YOU
I WAS OF COURSE FAMILIAR WITH THE PICTURES OF THE FAMOUS STATESMAN
BUT THE MAN HIMSELF WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM HIS REPRESENTATION
HE WAS A
TALL AND STATELY PERSON SCRUPULOUSLY DRESSED WITH A DRAWN THIN FACE
AND A NOSE WHICH WAS GROTESQUELY CURVED AND LONG
HIS COMPLEXION WAS
OF A DEAD PALLOR WHICH WAS MORE STARTLING BY CONTRAST WITH A LONG
DWINDLING BEARD OF VIVID RED WHICH FLOWED DOWN OVER HIS WHITE WAISTCOAT
WITH HIS WATCH CHAIN GLEAMING THROUGH ITS FRINGE
SUCH WAS THE STATELY
PRESENCE WHO LOOKED STONILY AT US FROM THE CENTRE OF DR
HUXTABLE'S
HEARTHRUG
BESIDE HIM STOOD A VERY YOUNG MAN WHOM I UNDERSTOOD TO
BE WILDER THE PRIVATE SECRETARY
HE WAS SMALL NERVOUS ALERT WITH
INTELLIGENT LIGHT BLUE EYES AND MOBILE FEATURES
IT WAS HE WHO AT ONCE
IN AN INCISIVE AND POSITIVE TONE OPENED THE CONVERSATION
I CALLED THIS MORNING DR
HUXTABLE TOO LATE TO PREVENT YOU FROM
STARTING FOR LONDON
I LEARNED THAT YOUR OBJECT WAS TO INVITE MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES TO UNDERTAKE THE CONDUCT OF THIS CASE
HIS GRACE IS
SURPRISED DR
HUXTABLE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SUCH A STEP WITHOUT
CONSULTING HIM
WHEN I LEARNED THAT THE POLICE HAD FAILED
HIS GRACE IS BY NO MEANS CONVINCED THAT THE POLICE HAVE FAILED
BUT SURELY MR
WILDER
YOU ARE WELL AWARE DR
HUXTABLE THAT HIS GRACE IS PARTICULARLY
ANXIOUS TO AVOID ALL PUBLIC SCANDAL
HE PREFERS TO TAKE AS FEW PEOPLE AS
POSSIBLE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE
THE MATTER CAN BE EASILY REMEDIED SAID THE BROW BEATEN DOCTOR MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES CAN RETURN TO LONDON BY THE MORNING TRAIN
HARDLY THAT DOCTOR HARDLY THAT SAID HOLMES IN HIS BLANDEST VOICE
THIS NORTHERN AIR IS INVIGORATING AND PLEASANT SO I PROPOSE TO SPEND A
FEW DAYS UPON YOUR MOORS AND TO OCCUPY MY MIND AS BEST I MAY
WHETHER
I HAVE THE SHELTER OF YOUR ROOF OR OF THE VILLAGE INN IS OF COURSE FOR
YOU TO DECIDE
I COULD SEE THAT THE UNFORTUNATE DOCTOR WAS IN THE LAST STAGE OF
INDECISION FROM WHICH HE WAS RESCUED BY THE DEEP SONOROUS VOICE OF THE
RED BEARDED DUKE WHICH BOOMED OUT LIKE A DINNER GONG
I AGREE WITH MR
WILDER DR
HUXTABLE THAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE WISELY
TO CONSULT ME
BUT SINCE MR
HOLMES HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN INTO YOUR
CONFIDENCE IT WOULD INDEED BE ABSURD THAT WE SHOULD NOT AVAIL OURSELVES
OF HIS SERVICES
FAR FROM GOING TO THE INN MR
HOLMES I SHOULD BE
PLEASED IF YOU WOULD COME AND STAY WITH ME AT HOLDERNESSE HALL
I THANK YOUR GRACE
FOR THE PURPOSES OF MY INVESTIGATION I THINK THAT
IT WOULD BE WISER FOR ME TO REMAIN AT THE SCENE OF THE MYSTERY
JUST AS YOU LIKE MR
HOLMES
ANY INFORMATION WHICH MR
WILDER OR I CAN
GIVE YOU IS OF COURSE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
IT WILL PROBABLY BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO SEE YOU AT THE HALL SAID
HOLMES
I WOULD ONLY ASK YOU NOW SIR WHETHER YOU HAVE FORMED ANY
EXPLANATION IN YOUR OWN MIND AS TO THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF YOUR
SON
NO SIR I HAVE NOT
EXCUSE ME IF I ALLUDE TO THAT WHICH IS PAINFUL TO YOU BUT I HAVE NO
ALTERNATIVE
DO YOU THINK THAT THE DUCHESS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE
MATTER
THE GREAT MINISTER SHOWED PERCEPTIBLE HESITATION
I DO NOT THINK SO HE SAID AT LAST
THE OTHER MOST OBVIOUS EXPLANATION IS THAT THE CHILD HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED
FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEVYING RANSOM
YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY DEMAND OF THE
SORT
NO SIR
ONE MORE QUESTION YOUR GRACE
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WROTE TO YOUR SON
UPON THE DAY WHEN THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED
NO I WROTE UPON THE DAY BEFORE
EXACTLY
BUT HE RECEIVED IT ON THAT DAY
YES
WAS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR LETTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE UNBALANCED HIM OR
INDUCED HIM TO TAKE SUCH A STEP
NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
DID YOU POST THAT LETTER YOURSELF
THE NOBLEMAN'S REPLY WAS INTERRUPTED BY HIS SECRETARY WHO BROKE IN WITH
SOME HEAT
HIS GRACE IS NOT IN THE HABIT OF POSTING LETTERS HIMSELF SAID HE
THIS LETTER WAS LAID WITH OTHERS UPON THE STUDY TABLE AND I MYSELF PUT
THEM IN THE POST BAG
YOU ARE SURE THIS ONE WAS AMONG THEM
YES I OBSERVED IT
HOW MANY LETTERS DID YOUR GRACE WRITE THAT DAY
TWENTY OR THIRTY
I HAVE A LARGE CORRESPONDENCE
BUT SURELY THIS IS
SOMEWHAT IRRELEVANT
NOT ENTIRELY SAID HOLMES
FOR MY OWN PART THE DUKE CONTINUED I HAVE ADVISED THE POLICE TO
TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT I
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DUCHESS WOULD ENCOURAGE SO MONSTROUS AN ACTION
BUT THE LAD HAD THE MOST WRONG HEADED OPINIONS AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
HE MAY HAVE FLED TO HER AIDED AND ABETTED BY THIS GERMAN
I THINK DR
HUXTABLE THAT WE WILL NOW RETURN TO THE HALL
I COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE OTHER QUESTIONS WHICH HOLMES WOULD HAVE
WISHED TO PUT BUT THE NOBLEMAN'S ABRUPT MANNER SHOWED THAT THE
INTERVIEW WAS AT AN END
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT TO HIS INTENSELY
ARISTOCRATIC NATURE THIS DISCUSSION OF HIS INTIMATE FAMILY AFFAIRS
WITH A STRANGER WAS MOST ABHORRENT AND THAT HE FEARED LEST EVERY
FRESH QUESTION WOULD THROW A FIERCER LIGHT INTO THE DISCREETLY SHADOWED
CORNERS OF HIS DUCAL HISTORY
WHEN THE NOBLEMAN AND HIS SECRETARY HAD LEFT MY FRIEND FLUNG HIMSELF AT
ONCE WITH CHARACTERISTIC EAGERNESS INTO THE INVESTIGATION
THE BOY'S CHAMBER WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINED AND YIELDED NOTHING SAVE THE
ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE WINDOW THAT HE COULD
HAVE ESCAPED
THE GERMAN MASTER'S ROOM AND EFFECTS GAVE NO FURTHER CLUE
IN HIS CASE A TRAILER OF IVY HAD GIVEN WAY UNDER HIS WEIGHT AND WE SAW
BY THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN THE MARK ON THE LAWN WHERE HIS HEELS HAD COME
DOWN
THAT ONE DINT IN THE SHORT GREEN GRASS WAS THE ONLY MATERIAL
WITNESS LEFT OF THIS INEXPLICABLE NOCTURNAL FLIGHT
SHERLOCK HOLMES LEFT THE HOUSE ALONE AND ONLY RETURNED AFTER ELEVEN
HE HAD OBTAINED A LARGE ORDNANCE MAP OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THIS
HE BROUGHT INTO MY ROOM WHERE HE LAID IT OUT ON THE BED AND HAVING
BALANCED THE LAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE BEGAN TO SMOKE OVER IT AND
OCCASIONALLY TO POINT OUT OBJECTS OF INTEREST WITH THE REEKING AMBER OF
HIS PIPE
GRAPHIC HOLMES' MAP OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SCHOOL
THIS CASE GROWS UPON ME WATSON SAID HE
THERE ARE DECIDEDLY SOME
POINTS OF INTEREST IN CONNECTION WITH IT
IN THIS EARLY STAGE I WANT
YOU TO REALIZE THOSE GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES WHICH MAY HAVE A GOOD DEAL TO
DO WITH OUR INVESTIGATION
LOOK AT THIS MAP
THIS DARK SQUARE IS THE PRIORY SCHOOL
I'LL PUT A PIN
IN IT
NOW THIS LINE IS THE MAIN ROAD
YOU SEE THAT IT RUNS EAST AND
WEST PAST THE SCHOOL AND YOU SEE ALSO THAT THERE IS NO SIDE ROAD FOR
A MILE EITHER WAY
IF THESE TWO FOLK PASSED AWAY BY ROAD IT WAS THIS
ROAD
GRAPHIC
EXACTLY
BY A SINGULAR AND HAPPY CHANCE WE ARE ABLE TO SOME EXTENT TO CHECK
WHAT PASSED ALONG THIS ROAD DURING THE NIGHT IN QUESTION
AT THIS POINT
WHERE MY PIPE IS NOW RESTING A COUNTY CONSTABLE WAS ON DUTY FROM TWELVE
TO SIX
IT IS AS YOU PERCEIVE THE FIRST CROSS ROAD ON THE EAST SIDE
THIS MAN DECLARES THAT HE WAS NOT ABSENT FROM HIS POST FOR AN INSTANT
AND HE IS POSITIVE THAT NEITHER BOY NOR MAN COULD HAVE GONE THAT WAY
UNSEEN
I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THIS POLICEMAN TO NIGHT AND HE APPEARS TO ME
TO BE A PERFECTLY RELIABLE PERSON
THAT BLOCKS THIS END
WE HAVE NOW TO
DEAL WITH THE OTHER
THERE IS AN INN HERE THE RED BULL THE LANDLADY
OF WHICH WAS ILL
SHE HAD SENT TO MACKLETON FOR A DOCTOR BUT HE DID NOT
ARRIVE UNTIL MORNING BEING ABSENT AT ANOTHER CASE
THE PEOPLE AT THE
INN WERE ALERT ALL NIGHT AWAITING HIS COMING AND ONE OR OTHER OF THEM
SEEMS TO HAVE CONTINUALLY HAD AN EYE UPON THE ROAD
THEY DECLARE THAT NO
ONE PASSED
IF THEIR EVIDENCE IS GOOD THEN WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO
BE ABLE TO BLOCK THE WEST AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THE FUGITIVES
DID NOT USE THE ROAD AT ALL
BUT THE BICYCLE I OBJECTED
QUITE SO
WE WILL COME TO THE BICYCLE PRESENTLY
TO CONTINUE OUR
REASONING IF THESE PEOPLE DID NOT GO BY THE ROAD THEY MUST HAVE
TRAVERSED THE COUNTRY TO THE NORTH OF THE HOUSE OR TO THE SOUTH OF THE
HOUSE
THAT IS CERTAIN
LET US WEIGH THE ONE AGAINST THE OTHER
ON THE
SOUTH OF THE HOUSE IS AS YOU PERCEIVE A LARGE DISTRICT OF ARABLE LAND
CUT UP INTO SMALL FIELDS WITH STONE WALLS BETWEEN THEM
THERE I ADMIT
THAT A BICYCLE IS IMPOSSIBLE
WE CAN DISMISS THE IDEA
WE TURN TO THE
COUNTRY ON THE NORTH
HERE THERE LIES A GROVE OF TREES MARKED AS THE
'RAGGED SHAW AND ON THE FARTHER SIDE STRETCHES A GREAT ROLLING MOOR
LOWER GILL MOOR EXTENDING FOR TEN MILES AND SLOPING GRADUALLY UPWARD
HERE AT ONE SIDE OF THIS WILDERNESS IS HOLDERNESSE HALL TEN MILES BY
ROAD BUT ONLY SIX ACROSS THE MOOR
IT IS A PECULIARLY DESOLATE PLAIN
A
FEW MOOR FARMERS HAVE SMALL HOLDINGS WHERE THEY REAR SHEEP AND CATTLE
EXCEPT THESE THE PLOVER AND THE CURLEW ARE THE ONLY INHABITANTS UNTIL
YOU COME TO THE CHESTERFIELD HIGH ROAD
THERE IS A CHURCH THERE
YOU SEE A FEW COTTAGES AND AN INN
BEYOND THAT THE HILLS BECOME
PRECIPITOUS
SURELY IT IS HERE TO THE NORTH THAT OUR QUEST MUST LIE
BUT THE BICYCLE I PERSISTED
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES IMPATIENTLY
A GOOD CYCLIST DOES NOT NEED A
HIGH ROAD
THE MOOR IS INTERSECTED WITH PATHS AND THE MOON WAS AT THE
FULL
HALLOA WHAT IS THIS
THERE WAS AN AGITATED KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS DR
HUXTABLE WAS IN THE ROOM
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A BLUE CRICKET CAP WITH A
WHITE CHEVRON ON THE PEAK
AT LAST WE HAVE A CLUE HE CRIED
THANK HEAVEN AT LAST WE ARE ON THE
DEAR BOY'S TRACK IT IS HIS CAP
WHERE WAS IT FOUND
IN THE VAN OF THE GIPSIES WHO CAMPED ON THE MOOR
THEY LEFT ON TUESDAY
TO DAY THE POLICE TRACED THEM DOWN AND EXAMINED THEIR CARAVAN
THIS WAS
FOUND
HOW DO THEY ACCOUNT FOR IT
THEY SHUFFLED AND LIED SAID THAT THEY FOUND IT ON THE MOOR ON TUESDAY
MORNING
THEY KNOW WHERE HE IS THE RASCALS THANK GOODNESS THEY ARE
ALL SAFE UNDER LOCK AND KEY
EITHER THE FEAR OF THE LAW OR THE DUKE'S
PURSE WILL CERTAINLY GET OUT OF THEM ALL THAT THEY KNOW
SO FAR SO GOOD SAID HOLMES WHEN THE DOCTOR HAD AT LAST LEFT THE
ROOM
IT AT LEAST BEARS OUT THE THEORY THAT IT IS ON THE SIDE OF THE
LOWER GILL MOOR THAT WE MUST HOPE FOR RESULTS
THE POLICE HAVE REALLY
DONE NOTHING LOCALLY SAVE THE ARREST OF THESE GIPSIES
LOOK HERE
WATSON THERE IS A WATERCOURSE ACROSS THE MOOR
YOU SEE IT MARKED HERE
IN THE MAP
IN SOME PARTS IT WIDENS INTO A MORASS
THIS IS PARTICULARLY
SO IN THE REGION BETWEEN HOLDERNESSE HALL AND THE SCHOOL
IT IS VAIN TO
LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR TRACKS IN THIS DRY WEATHER BUT AT THAT POINT THERE
IS CERTAINLY A CHANCE OF SOME RECORD BEING LEFT
I WILL CALL YOU EARLY
TO MORROW MORNING AND YOU AND I WILL TRY IF WE CAN THROW SOME LITTLE
LIGHT UPON THE MYSTERY
THE DAY WAS JUST BREAKING WHEN I WOKE TO FIND THE LONG THIN FORM OF
HOLMES BY MY BEDSIDE
HE WAS FULLY DRESSED AND HAD APPARENTLY ALREADY
BEEN OUT
I HAVE DONE THE LAWN AND THE BICYCLE SHED SAID HE
I HAVE ALSO HAD
A RUMBLE THROUGH THE RAGGED SHAW
NOW WATSON THERE IS COCOA READY IN
THE NEXT ROOM
I MUST BEG YOU TO HURRY FOR WE HAVE A GREAT DAY BEFORE
US
HIS EYES SHONE AND HIS CHEEK WAS FLUSHED WITH THE EXHILARATION OF THE
MASTER WORKMAN WHO SEES HIS WORK LIE READY BEFORE HIM
A VERY DIFFERENT
HOLMES THIS ACTIVE ALERT MAN FROM THE INTROSPECTIVE AND PALLID
DREAMER OF BAKER STREET
I FELT AS I LOOKED UPON THAT SUPPLE FIGURE
ALIVE WITH NERVOUS ENERGY THAT IT WAS INDEED A STRENUOUS DAY THAT
AWAITED US
AND YET IT OPENED IN THE BLACKEST DISAPPOINTMENT
WITH HIGH HOPES WE
STRUCK ACROSS THE PEATY RUSSET MOOR INTERSECTED WITH A THOUSAND SHEEP
PATHS UNTIL WE CAME TO THE BROAD LIGHT GREEN BELT WHICH MARKED THE
MORASS BETWEEN US AND HOLDERNESSE
CERTAINLY IF THE LAD HAD GONE
HOMEWARD HE MUST HAVE PASSED THIS AND HE COULD NOT PASS IT WITHOUT
LEAVING HIS TRACES
BUT NO SIGN OF HIM OR THE GERMAN COULD BE SEEN
WITH
A DARKENING FACE MY FRIEND STRODE ALONG THE MARGIN EAGERLY OBSERVANT
OF EVERY MUDDY STAIN UPON THE MOSSY SURFACE
SHEEP MARKS THERE WERE
IN PROFUSION AND AT ONE PLACE SOME MILES DOWN COWS HAD LEFT THEIR
TRACKS
NOTHING MORE
CHECK NUMBER ONE SAID HOLMES LOOKING GLOOMILY OVER THE ROLLING
EXPANSE OF THE MOOR
THERE IS ANOTHER MORASS DOWN YONDER AND A NARROW
NECK BETWEEN
HALLOA HALLOA HALLOA WHAT HAVE WE HERE
WE HAD COME ON A SMALL BLACK RIBBON OF PATHWAY
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
CLEARLY MARKED ON THE SODDEN SOIL WAS THE TRACK OF A BICYCLE
HURRAH I CRIED
WE HAVE IT
BUT HOLMES WAS SHAKING HIS HEAD AND HIS FACE WAS PUZZLED AND EXPECTANT
RATHER THAN JOYOUS
A BICYCLE CERTAINLY BUT NOT THE BICYCLE SAID HE
I AM FAMILIAR
WITH FORTY TWO DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY TIRES
THIS AS YOU
PERCEIVE IS A DUNLOP WITH A PATCH UPON THE OUTER COVER
HEIDEGGER'S
TIRES WERE PALMER'S LEAVING LONGITUDINAL STRIPES
AVELING THE
MATHEMATICAL MASTER WAS SURE UPON THE POINT
THEREFORE IT IS NOT
HEIDEGGER'S TRACK
THE BOY'S THEN
POSSIBLY IF WE COULD PROVE A BICYCLE TO HAVE BEEN IN HIS POSSESSION
BUT THIS WE HAVE UTTERLY FAILED TO DO
THIS TRACK AS YOU PERCEIVE WAS
MADE BY A RIDER WHO WAS GOING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE SCHOOL
OR TOWARDS IT
NO NO MY DEAR WATSON
THE MORE DEEPLY SUNK IMPRESSION IS OF COURSE
THE HIND WHEEL UPON WHICH THE WEIGHT RESTS
YOU PERCEIVE SEVERAL PLACES
WHERE IT HAS PASSED ACROSS AND OBLITERATED THE MORE SHALLOW MARK OF THE
FRONT ONE
IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY HEADING AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL
IT MAY OR
MAY NOT BE CONNECTED WITH OUR INQUIRY BUT WE WILL FOLLOW IT BACKWARDS
BEFORE WE GO ANY FARTHER
WE DID SO AND AT THE END OF A FEW HUNDRED YARDS LOST THE TRACKS AS
WE EMERGED FROM THE BOGGY PORTION OF THE MOOR
FOLLOWING THE PATH
BACKWARDS WE PICKED OUT ANOTHER SPOT WHERE A SPRING TRICKLED ACROSS
IT
HERE ONCE AGAIN WAS THE MARK OF THE BICYCLE THOUGH NEARLY
OBLITERATED BY THE HOOFS OF COWS
AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO SIGN BUT
THE PATH RAN RIGHT ON INTO RAGGED SHAW THE WOOD WHICH BACKED ON TO THE
SCHOOL
FROM THIS WOOD THE CYCLE MUST HAVE EMERGED
HOLMES SAT DOWN ON
A BOULDER AND RESTED HIS CHIN IN HIS HANDS
I HAD SMOKED TWO CIGARETTES
BEFORE HE MOVED
WELL WELL SAID HE AT LAST
IT IS OF COURSE POSSIBLE THAT A
CUNNING MAN MIGHT CHANGE THE TIRES OF HIS BICYCLE IN ORDER TO LEAVE
UNFAMILIAR TRACKS
A CRIMINAL WHO WAS CAPABLE OF SUCH A THOUGHT IS A MAN
WHOM I SHOULD BE PROUD TO DO BUSINESS WITH
WE WILL LEAVE THIS QUESTION
UNDECIDED AND HARK BACK TO OUR MORASS AGAIN FOR WE HAVE LEFT A GOOD
DEAL UNEXPLORED
WE CONTINUED OUR SYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF THE EDGE OF THE SODDEN PORTION
OF THE MOOR AND SOON OUR PERSEVERANCE WAS GLORIOUSLY REWARDED
RIGHT
ACROSS THE LOWER PART OF THE BOG LAY A MIRY PATH
HOLMES GAVE A CRY
OF DELIGHT AS HE APPROACHED IT
AN IMPRESSION LIKE A FINE BUNDLE OF
TELEGRAPH WIRES RAN DOWN THE CENTRE OF IT
IT WAS THE PALMER TIRES
HERE IS HERR HEIDEGGER SURE ENOUGH CRIED HOLMES EXULTANTLY
MY
REASONING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PRETTY SOUND WATSON
I CONGRATULATE YOU
BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY STILL TO GO
KINDLY WALK CLEAR OF THE PATH
NOW
LET US FOLLOW THE TRAIL
I FEAR THAT IT WILL NOT LEAD VERY FAR
WE FOUND HOWEVER AS WE ADVANCED THAT THIS PORTION OF THE MOOR IS
INTERSECTED WITH SOFT PATCHES AND THOUGH WE FREQUENTLY LOST SIGHT OF
THE TRACK WE ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN PICKING IT UP ONCE MORE
DO YOU OBSERVE SAID HOLMES THAT THE RIDER IS NOW UNDOUBTEDLY
FORCING THE PACE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF IT
LOOK AT THIS IMPRESSION
WHERE YOU GET BOTH TIRES CLEAR
THE ONE IS AS DEEP AS THE OTHER
THAT CAN ONLY MEAN THAT THE RIDER IS THROWING HIS WEIGHT ON TO THE
HANDLE BAR AS A MAN DOES WHEN HE IS SPRINTING
BY JOVE HE HAS HAD A
FALL
THERE WAS A BROAD IRREGULAR SMUDGE COVERING SOME YARDS OF THE TRACK
THEN THERE WERE A FEW FOOTMARKS AND THE TIRE REAPPEARED ONCE MORE
A SIDE SLIP I SUGGESTED
HOLMES HELD UP A CRUMPLED BRANCH OF FLOWERING GORSE
TO MY HORROR I
PERCEIVED THAT THE YELLOW BLOSSOMS WERE ALL DABBLED WITH CRIMSON
ON THE
PATH TOO AND AMONG THE HEATHER WERE DARK STAINS OF CLOTTED BLOOD
BAD SAID HOLMES
BAD STAND CLEAR WATSON NOT AN UNNECESSARY
FOOTSTEP WHAT DO I READ HERE HE FELL WOUNDED HE STOOD UP HE
REMOUNTED HE PROCEEDED
BUT THERE IS NO OTHER TRACK
CATTLE ON THIS
SIDE PATH
HE WAS SURELY NOT GORED BY A BULL IMPOSSIBLE BUT I SEE NO
TRACES OF ANYONE ELSE
WE MUST PUSH ON WATSON
SURELY WITH STAINS AS
WELL AS THE TRACK TO GUIDE US HE CANNOT ESCAPE US NOW
OUR SEARCH WAS NOT A VERY LONG ONE
THE TRACKS OF THE TIRE BEGAN TO
CURVE FANTASTICALLY UPON THE WET AND SHINING PATH
SUDDENLY AS I
LOOKED AHEAD THE GLEAM OF METAL CAUGHT MY EYE FROM AMID THE THICK
GORSE BUSHES
OUT OF THEM WE DRAGGED A BICYCLE PALMER TIRED ONE PEDAL
BENT AND THE WHOLE FRONT OF IT HORRIBLY SMEARED AND SLOBBERED WITH
BLOOD
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUSHES A SHOE WAS PROJECTING
WE
RAN ROUND AND THERE LAY THE UNFORTUNATE RIDER
HE WAS A TALL MAN
FULL BEARDED WITH SPECTACLES ONE GLASS OF WHICH HAD BEEN KNOCKED OUT
THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH WAS A FRIGHTFUL BLOW UPON THE HEAD WHICH HAD
CRUSHED IN PART OF HIS SKULL
THAT HE COULD HAVE GONE ON AFTER RECEIVING
SUCH AN INJURY SAID MUCH FOR THE VITALITY AND COURAGE OF THE MAN
HE
WORE SHOES BUT NO SOCKS AND HIS OPEN COAT DISCLOSED A NIGHTSHIRT
BENEATH IT
IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE GERMAN MASTER
HOLMES TURNED THE BODY OVER REVERENTLY AND EXAMINED IT WITH GREAT
ATTENTION
HE THEN SAT IN DEEP THOUGHT FOR A TIME AND I COULD SEE
BY HIS RUFFLED BROW THAT THIS GRIM DISCOVERY HAD NOT IN HIS OPINION
ADVANCED US MUCH IN OUR INQUIRY
IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WATSON SAID HE AT LAST
MY OWN INCLINATIONS ARE TO PUSH THIS INQUIRY ON FOR WE HAVE ALREADY
LOST SO MUCH TIME THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WASTE ANOTHER HOUR
ON THE
OTHER HAND WE ARE BOUND TO INFORM THE POLICE OF THE DISCOVERY AND TO
SEE THAT THIS POOR FELLOW'S BODY IS LOOKED AFTER
I COULD TAKE A NOTE BACK
BUT I NEED YOUR COMPANY AND ASSISTANCE
WAIT A BIT THERE IS A FELLOW
CUTTING PEAT UP YONDER
BRING HIM OVER HERE AND HE WILL GUIDE THE
POLICE
I BROUGHT THE PEASANT ACROSS AND HOLMES DISPATCHED THE FRIGHTENED MAN
WITH A NOTE TO DR
HUXTABLE
NOW WATSON SAID HE WE HAVE PICKED UP TWO CLUES THIS MORNING
ONE
IS THE BICYCLE WITH THE PALMER TIRE AND WE SEE WHAT THAT HAS LED TO
THE OTHER IS THE BICYCLE WITH THE PATCHED DUNLOP
BEFORE WE START TO
INVESTIGATE THAT LET US TRY TO REALIZE WHAT WE DO KNOW SO AS TO MAKE
THE MOST OF IT AND TO SEPARATE THE ESSENTIAL FROM THE ACCIDENTAL
FIRST OF ALL I WISH TO IMPRESS UPON YOU THAT THE BOY CERTAINLY LEFT OF
HIS OWN FREE WILL
HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS WINDOW AND HE WENT OFF EITHER
ALONE OR WITH SOMEONE
THAT IS SURE
I ASSENTED
WELL NOW LET US TURN TO THIS UNFORTUNATE GERMAN MASTER
THE BOY WAS
FULLY DRESSED WHEN HE FLED
THEREFORE HE FORESAW WHAT HE WOULD DO
BUT THE GERMAN WENT WITHOUT HIS SOCKS
HE CERTAINLY ACTED ON VERY SHORT
NOTICE
UNDOUBTEDLY
WHY DID HE GO BECAUSE FROM HIS BEDROOM WINDOW HE SAW THE FLIGHT OF
THE BOY BECAUSE HE WISHED TO OVERTAKE HIM AND BRING HIM BACK
HE SEIZED
HIS BICYCLE PURSUED THE LAD AND IN PURSUING HIM MET HIS DEATH
SO IT WOULD SEEM
NOW I COME TO THE CRITICAL PART OF MY ARGUMENT
THE NATURAL ACTION OF
A MAN IN PURSUING A LITTLE BOY WOULD BE TO RUN AFTER HIM
HE WOULD KNOW
THAT HE COULD OVERTAKE HIM
BUT THE GERMAN DOES NOT DO SO
HE TURNS TO
HIS BICYCLE
I AM TOLD THAT HE WAS AN EXCELLENT CYCLIST
HE WOULD NOT DO
THIS IF HE DID NOT SEE THAT THE BOY HAD SOME SWIFT MEANS OF ESCAPE
THE OTHER BICYCLE
LET US CONTINUE OUR RECONSTRUCTION
HE MEETS HIS DEATH FIVE MILES
FROM THE SCHOOL NOT BY A BULLET MARK YOU WHICH EVEN A LAD MIGHT
CONCEIVABLY DISCHARGE BUT BY A SAVAGE BLOW DEALT BY A VIGOROUS ARM
THE LAD THEN HAD A COMPANION IN HIS FLIGHT
AND THE FLIGHT WAS A SWIFT
ONE SINCE IT TOOK FIVE MILES BEFORE AN EXPERT CYCLIST COULD OVERTAKE
THEM
YET WE SURVEY THE GROUND ROUND THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY
WHAT DO
WE FIND A FEW CATTLE TRACKS NOTHING MORE
I TOOK A WIDE SWEEP ROUND
AND THERE IS NO PATH WITHIN FIFTY YARDS
ANOTHER CYCLIST COULD HAVE
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL MURDER NOR WERE THERE ANY HUMAN
FOOT MARKS
HOLMES I CRIED THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE
ADMIRABLE HE SAID
A MOST ILLUMINATING REMARK
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AS I
STATE IT AND THEREFORE I MUST IN SOME RESPECT HAVE STATED IT WRONG
YET
YOU SAW FOR YOURSELF
CAN YOU SUGGEST ANY FALLACY
HE COULD NOT HAVE FRACTURED HIS SKULL IN A FALL
IN A MORASS WATSON
I AM AT MY WIT'S END
TUT TUT WE HAVE SOLVED SOME WORSE PROBLEMS
AT LEAST WE HAVE PLENTY
OF MATERIAL IF WE CAN ONLY USE IT
COME THEN AND HAVING EXHAUSTED
THE PALMER LET US SEE WHAT THE DUNLOP WITH THE PATCHED COVER HAS TO
OFFER US
WE PICKED UP THE TRACK AND FOLLOWED IT ONWARD FOR SOME DISTANCE BUT
SOON THE MOOR ROSE INTO A LONG HEATHER TUFTED CURVE AND WE LEFT THE
WATERCOURSE BEHIND US
NO FURTHER HELP FROM TRACKS COULD BE HOPED FOR
AT THE SPOT WHERE WE SAW THE LAST OF THE DUNLOP TIRE IT MIGHT EQUALLY
HAVE LED TO HOLDERNESSE HALL THE STATELY TOWERS OF WHICH ROSE SOME
MILES TO OUR LEFT OR TO A LOW GRAY VILLAGE WHICH LAY IN FRONT OF US
AND MARKED THE POSITION OF THE CHESTERFIELD HIGH ROAD
AS WE APPROACHED THE FORBIDDING AND SQUALID INN WITH THE SIGN OF A
GAME COCK ABOVE THE DOOR HOLMES GAVE A SUDDEN GROAN AND CLUTCHED ME
BY THE SHOULDER TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM FALLING
HE HAD HAD ONE OF THOSE
VIOLENT STRAINS OF THE ANKLE WHICH LEAVE A MAN HELPLESS
WITH DIFFICULTY
HE LIMPED UP TO THE DOOR WHERE A SQUAT DARK ELDERLY MAN WAS SMOKING A
BLACK CLAY PIPE
HOW ARE YOU MR
REUBEN HAYES SAID HOLMES
WHO ARE YOU AND HOW DO YOU GET MY NAME SO PAT THE COUNTRYMAN
ANSWERED WITH A SUSPICIOUS FLASH OF A PAIR OF CUNNING EYES
WELL IT'S PRINTED ON THE BOARD ABOVE YOUR HEAD
IT'S EASY TO SEE A MAN
WHO IS MASTER OF HIS OWN HOUSE
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVEN'T SUCH A THING AS A
CARRIAGE IN YOUR STABLES
NO I HAVE NOT
I CAN HARDLY PUT MY FOOT TO THE GROUND
DON'T PUT IT TO THE GROUND
BUT I CAN'T WALK
WELL THEN HOP
MR
REUBEN HAYES'S MANNER WAS FAR FROM GRACIOUS BUT HOLMES TOOK IT WITH
ADMIRABLE GOOD HUMOUR
LOOK HERE MY MAN SAID HE
THIS IS REALLY RATHER AN AWKWARD FIX FOR
ME
I DON'T MIND HOW I GET ON
NEITHER DO I SAID THE MOROSE LANDLORD
THE MATTER IS VERY IMPORTANT
I WOULD OFFER YOU A SOVEREIGN FOR THE USE
OF A BICYCLE
THE LANDLORD PRICKED UP HIS EARS
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO HOLDERNESSE HALL
PALS OF THE DOOK I SUPPOSE SAID THE LANDLORD SURVEYING OUR
MUD STAINED GARMENTS WITH IRONICAL EYES
HOLMES LAUGHED GOOD NATUREDLY
HE'LL BE GLAD TO SEE US ANYHOW
WHY
BECAUSE WE BRING HIM NEWS OF HIS LOST SON
THE LANDLORD GAVE A VERY VISIBLE START
WHAT YOU'RE ON HIS TRACK
HE HAS BEEN HEARD OF IN LIVERPOOL
THEY EXPECT TO GET HIM EVERY HOUR
AGAIN A SWIFT CHANGE PASSED OVER THE HEAVY UNSHAVEN FACE
HIS MANNER
WAS SUDDENLY GENIAL
I'VE LESS REASON TO WISH THE DOOK WELL THAN MOST MEN SAID HE FOR
I WAS HEAD COACHMAN ONCE AND CRUEL BAD HE TREATED ME
IT WAS HIM THAT
SACKED ME WITHOUT A CHARACTER ON THE WORD OF A LYING CORN CHANDLER
BUT
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE YOUNG LORD WAS HEARD OF IN LIVERPOOL AND I'LL
HELP YOU TO TAKE THE NEWS TO THE HALL
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES
WE'LL HAVE SOME FOOD FIRST
THEN YOU CAN BRING
ROUND THE BICYCLE
I HAVEN'T GOT A BICYCLE
HOLMES HELD UP A SOVEREIGN
I TELL YOU MAN THAT I HAVEN'T GOT ONE
I'LL LET YOU HAVE TWO HORSES
AS FAR AS THE HALL
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT WHEN WE'VE HAD SOMETHING
TO EAT
WHEN WE WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE STONE FLAGGED KITCHEN IT WAS ASTONISHING
HOW RAPIDLY THAT SPRAINED ANKLE RECOVERED
IT WAS NEARLY NIGHTFALL AND
WE HAD EATEN NOTHING SINCE EARLY MORNING SO THAT WE SPENT SOME TIME
OVER OUR MEAL
HOLMES WAS LOST IN THOUGHT AND ONCE OR TWICE HE WALKED
OVER TO THE WINDOW AND STARED EARNESTLY OUT
IT OPENED ON TO A SQUALID
COURTYARD
IN THE FAR CORNER WAS A SMITHY WHERE A GRIMY LAD WAS AT
WORK
ON THE OTHER SIDE WERE THE STABLES
HOLMES HAD SAT DOWN AGAIN
AFTER ONE OF THESE EXCURSIONS WHEN HE SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR
WITH A LOUD EXCLAMATION
BY HEAVEN WATSON I BELIEVE THAT I'VE GOT IT HE CRIED
YES YES IT
MUST BE SO
WATSON DO YOU REMEMBER SEEING ANY COW TRACKS TO DAY
YES SEVERAL
WHERE
WELL EVERYWHERE
THEY WERE AT THE MORASS AND AGAIN ON THE PATH AND
AGAIN NEAR WHERE POOR HEIDEGGER MET HIS DEATH
EXACTLY
WELL NOW WATSON HOW MANY COWS DID YOU SEE ON THE MOOR
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING ANY
STRANGE WATSON THAT WE SHOULD SEE TRACKS ALL ALONG OUR LINE BUT
NEVER A COW ON THE WHOLE MOOR
VERY STRANGE WATSON EH
YES IT IS STRANGE
NOW WATSON MAKE AN EFFORT THROW YOUR MIND BACK
CAN YOU SEE THOSE
TRACKS UPON THE PATH
YES I CAN
CAN YOU RECALL THAT THE TRACKS WERE SOMETIMES LIKE THAT WATSON HE
ARRANGED A NUMBER OF BREAD CRUMBS IN THIS FASHION AND
SOMETIMES LIKE THIS
AND OCCASIONALLY LIKE THIS
CAN YOU REMEMBER THAT
NO I CANNOT
BUT I CAN
I COULD SWEAR TO IT
HOWEVER WE WILL GO BACK AT OUR
LEISURE AND VERIFY IT
WHAT A BLIND BEETLE I HAVE BEEN NOT TO DRAW MY
CONCLUSION
AND WHAT IS YOUR CONCLUSION
ONLY THAT IT IS A REMARKABLE COW WHICH WALKS CANTERS AND GALLOPS
BY
GEORGE WATSON IT WAS NO BRAIN OF A COUNTRY PUBLICAN THAT THOUGHT OUT
SUCH A BLIND AS THAT
THE COAST SEEMS TO BE CLEAR SAVE FOR THAT LAD IN
THE SMITHY
LET US SLIP OUT AND SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE
THERE WERE TWO ROUGH HAIRED UNKEMPT HORSES IN THE TUMBLE DOWN STABLE
HOLMES RAISED THE HIND LEG OF ONE OF THEM AND LAUGHED ALOUD
OLD SHOES BUT NEWLY SHOD OLD SHOES BUT NEW NAILS
THIS CASE DESERVES
TO BE A CLASSIC
LET US GO ACROSS TO THE SMITHY
THE LAD CONTINUED HIS WORK WITHOUT REGARDING US
I SAW HOLMES'S EYE
DARTING TO RIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE LITTER OF IRON AND WOOD WHICH WAS
SCATTERED ABOUT THE FLOOR
SUDDENLY HOWEVER WE HEARD A STEP BEHIND
US AND THERE WAS THE LANDLORD HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS DRAWN OVER HIS SAVAGE
EYES HIS SWARTHY FEATURES CONVULSED WITH PASSION
HE HELD A SHORT
METAL HEADED STICK IN HIS HAND AND HE ADVANCED IN SO MENACING A FASHION
THAT I WAS RIGHT GLAD TO FEEL THE REVOLVER IN MY POCKET
YOU INFERNAL SPIES THE MAN CRIED
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE
WHY MR
REUBEN HAYES SAID HOLMES COOLLY ONE MIGHT THINK THAT YOU
WERE AFRAID OF OUR FINDING SOMETHING OUT
THE MAN MASTERED HIMSELF WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT AND HIS GRIM MOUTH
LOOSENED INTO A FALSE LAUGH WHICH WAS MORE MENACING THAN HIS FROWN
YOU'RE WELCOME TO ALL YOU CAN FIND OUT IN MY SMITHY SAID HE
BUT
LOOK HERE MISTER I DON'T CARE FOR FOLK POKING ABOUT MY PLACE WITHOUT
MY LEAVE SO THE SOONER YOU PAY YOUR SCORE AND GET OUT OF THIS THE
BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED
ALL RIGHT MR
HAYES NO HARM MEANT SAID HOLMES
WE HAVE BEEN HAVING
A LOOK AT YOUR HORSES BUT I THINK I'LL WALK AFTER ALL
IT'S NOT FAR I
BELIEVE
NOT MORE THAN TWO MILES TO THE HALL GATES
THAT'S THE ROAD TO THE
LEFT HE WATCHED US WITH SULLEN EYES UNTIL WE HAD LEFT HIS PREMISES
WE DID NOT GO VERY FAR ALONG THE ROAD FOR HOLMES STOPPED THE INSTANT
THAT THE CURVE HID US FROM THE LANDLORD'S VIEW
WE WERE WARM AS THE CHILDREN SAY AT THAT INN SAID HE
I SEEM
TO GROW COLDER EVERY STEP THAT I TAKE AWAY FROM IT
NO NO I CAN'T
POSSIBLY LEAVE IT
I AM CONVINCED SAID I THAT THIS REUBEN HAYES KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT
A
MORE SELF EVIDENT VILLAIN I NEVER SAW
OH HE IMPRESSED YOU IN THAT WAY DID HE THERE ARE THE HORSES THERE
IS THE SMITHY
YES IT IS AN INTERESTING PLACE THIS FIGHTING COCK
I
THINK WE SHALL HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT IN AN UNOBTRUSIVE WAY
A LONG SLOPING HILLSIDE DOTTED WITH GRAY LIMESTONE BOULDERS STRETCHED
BEHIND US
WE HAD TURNED OFF THE ROAD AND WERE MAKING OUR WAY UP
THE HILL WHEN LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION OF HOLDERNESSE HALL I SAW A
CYCLIST COMING SWIFTLY ALONG
GET DOWN WATSON CRIED HOLMES WITH A HEAVY HAND UPON MY SHOULDER
WE
HAD HARDLY SUNK FROM VIEW WHEN THE MAN FLEW PAST US ON THE ROAD
AMID
A ROLLING CLOUD OF DUST I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A PALE AGITATED FACE A
FACE WITH HORROR IN EVERY LINEAMENT THE MOUTH OPEN THE EYES STARING
WILDLY IN FRONT
IT WAS LIKE SOME STRANGE CARICATURE OF THE DAPPER JAMES
WILDER WHOM WE HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
THE DUKE'S SECRETARY CRIED HOLMES
COME WATSON LET US SEE WHAT HE
DOES
WE SCRAMBLED FROM ROCK TO ROCK UNTIL IN A FEW MOMENTS WE HAD MADE
OUR WAY TO A POINT FROM WHICH WE COULD SEE THE FRONT DOOR OF THE INN
WILDER'S BICYCLE WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL BESIDE IT
NO ONE WAS
MOVING ABOUT THE HOUSE NOR COULD WE CATCH A GLIMPSE OF ANY FACES AT THE
WINDOWS
SLOWLY THE TWILIGHT CREPT DOWN AS THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE
HIGH TOWERS OF HOLDERNESSE HALL
THEN IN THE GLOOM WE SAW THE TWO
SIDE LAMPS OF A TRAP LIGHT UP IN THE STABLE YARD OF THE INN AND SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS HEARD THE RATTLE OF HOOFS AS IT WHEELED OUT INTO THE ROAD
AND TORE OFF AT A FURIOUS PACE IN THE DIRECTION OF CHESTERFIELD
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT WATSON HOLMES WHISPERED
IT LOOKS LIKE A FLIGHT
A SINGLE MAN IN A DOG CART SO FAR AS I COULD SEE
WELL IT CERTAINLY
WAS NOT MR
JAMES WILDER FOR THERE HE IS AT THE DOOR
A RED SQUARE OF LIGHT HAD SPRUNG OUT OF THE DARKNESS
IN THE MIDDLE OF
IT WAS THE BLACK FIGURE OF THE SECRETARY HIS HEAD ADVANCED PEERING OUT
INTO THE NIGHT
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE
THEN AT
LAST THERE WERE STEPS IN THE ROAD A SECOND FIGURE WAS VISIBLE FOR AN
INSTANT AGAINST THE LIGHT THE DOOR SHUT AND ALL WAS BLACK ONCE MORE
FIVE MINUTES LATER A LAMP WAS LIT IN A ROOM UPON THE FIRST FLOOR
IT SEEMS TO BE A CURIOUS CLASS OF CUSTOM THAT IS DONE BY THE FIGHTING
COCK SAID HOLMES
THE BAR IS ON THE OTHER SIDE
QUITE SO
THESE ARE WHAT ONE MAY CALL THE PRIVATE GUESTS
NOW WHAT IN
THE WORLD IS MR
JAMES WILDER DOING IN THAT DEN AT THIS HOUR OF NIGHT
AND WHO IS THE COMPANION WHO COMES TO MEET HIM THERE COME WATSON
WE MUST REALLY TAKE A RISK AND TRY TO INVESTIGATE THIS A LITTLE MORE
CLOSELY
TOGETHER WE STOLE DOWN TO THE ROAD AND CREPT ACROSS TO THE DOOR OF THE
INN
THE BICYCLE STILL LEANED AGAINST THE WALL
HOLMES STRUCK A MATCH
AND HELD IT TO THE BACK WHEEL AND I HEARD HIM CHUCKLE AS THE LIGHT FELL
UPON A PATCHED DUNLOP TIRE
UP ABOVE US WAS THE LIGHTED WINDOW
I MUST HAVE A PEEP THROUGH THAT WATSON
IF YOU BEND YOUR BACK AND
SUPPORT YOURSELF UPON THE WALL I THINK THAT I CAN MANAGE
AN INSTANT LATER HIS FEET WERE ON MY SHOULDERS BUT HE WAS HARDLY UP
BEFORE HE WAS DOWN AGAIN
COME MY FRIEND SAID HE OUR DAY'S WORK HAS BEEN QUITE LONG ENOUGH
I THINK THAT WE HAVE GATHERED ALL THAT WE CAN
IT'S A LONG WALK TO THE
SCHOOL AND THE SOONER WE GET STARTED THE BETTER
HE HARDLY OPENED HIS LIPS DURING THAT WEARY TRUDGE ACROSS THE MOOR NOR
WOULD HE ENTER THE SCHOOL WHEN HE REACHED IT BUT WENT ON TO MACKLETON
STATION WHENCE HE COULD SEND SOME TELEGRAMS
LATE AT NIGHT I HEARD HIM
CONSOLING DR
HUXTABLE PROSTRATED BY THE TRAGEDY OF HIS MASTER'S DEATH
AND LATER STILL HE ENTERED MY ROOM AS ALERT AND VIGOROUS AS HE HAD BEEN
WHEN HE STARTED IN THE MORNING
ALL GOES WELL MY FRIEND SAID HE
I
PROMISE THAT BEFORE TO MORROW EVENING WE SHALL HAVE REACHED THE SOLUTION
OF THE MYSTERY
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING MY FRIEND AND I WERE WALKING UP THE
FAMOUS YEW AVENUE OF HOLDERNESSE HALL
WE WERE USHERED THROUGH THE
MAGNIFICENT ELIZABETHAN DOORWAY AND INTO HIS GRACE'S STUDY
THERE WE
FOUND MR
JAMES WILDER DEMURE AND COURTLY BUT WITH SOME TRACE OF THAT
WILD TERROR OF THE NIGHT BEFORE STILL LURKING IN HIS FURTIVE EYES AND IN
HIS TWITCHING FEATURES
YOU HAVE COME TO SEE HIS GRACE I AM SORRY BUT THE FACT IS THAT THE
DUKE IS FAR FROM WELL
HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH UPSET BY THE TRAGIC NEWS
WE RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM DR
HUXTABLE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WHICH TOLD
US OF YOUR DISCOVERY
I MUST SEE THE DUKE MR
WILDER
BUT HE IS IN HIS ROOM
THEN I MUST GO TO HIS ROOM
I BELIEVE HE IS IN HIS BED
I WILL SEE HIM THERE
HOLMES'S COLD AND INEXORABLE MANNER SHOWED THE SECRETARY THAT IT WAS
USELESS TO ARGUE WITH HIM
VERY GOOD MR
HOLMES I WILL TELL HIM THAT YOU ARE HERE
AFTER AN HOUR'S DELAY THE GREAT NOBLEMAN APPEARED
HIS FACE WAS MORE
CADAVEROUS THAN EVER HIS SHOULDERS HAD ROUNDED AND HE SEEMED TO ME
TO BE AN ALTOGETHER OLDER MAN THAN HE HAD BEEN THE MORNING BEFORE
HE
GREETED US WITH A STATELY COURTESY AND SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS DESK HIS
RED BEARD STREAMING DOWN ON THE TABLE
WELL MR
HOLMES SAID HE
BUT MY FRIEND'S EYES WERE FIXED UPON THE SECRETARY WHO STOOD BY HIS
MASTER'S CHAIR
I THINK YOUR GRACE THAT I COULD SPEAK MORE FREELY IN MR
WILDER'S
ABSENCE
THE MAN TURNED A SHADE PALER AND CAST A MALIGNANT GLANCE AT HOLMES
IF YOUR GRACE WISHES
YES YES YOU HAD BETTER GO
NOW MR
HOLMES WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY
MY FRIEND WAITED UNTIL THE DOOR HAD CLOSED BEHIND THE RETREATING
SECRETARY
THE FACT IS YOUR GRACE SAID HE THAT MY COLLEAGUE DR
WATSON AND
MYSELF HAD AN ASSURANCE FROM DR
HUXTABLE THAT A REWARD HAD BEEN OFFERED
IN THIS CASE
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS CONFIRMED FROM YOUR OWN LIPS
CERTAINLY MR
HOLMES
IT AMOUNTED IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED TO FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS TO
ANYONE WHO WILL TELL YOU WHERE YOUR SON IS
EXACTLY
AND ANOTHER THOUSAND TO THE MAN WHO WILL NAME THE PERSON OR PERSONS WHO
KEEP HIM IN CUSTODY
EXACTLY
UNDER THE LATTER HEADING IS INCLUDED NO DOUBT NOT ONLY THOSE WHO
MAY HAVE TAKEN HIM AWAY BUT ALSO THOSE WHO CONSPIRE TO KEEP HIM IN HIS
PRESENT POSITION
YES YES CRIED THE DUKE IMPATIENTLY
IF YOU DO YOUR WORK WELL
MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU WILL HAVE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF NIGGARDLY
TREATMENT
MY FRIEND RUBBED HIS THIN HANDS TOGETHER WITH AN APPEARANCE OF AVIDITY
WHICH WAS A SURPRISE TO ME WHO KNEW HIS FRUGAL TASTES
I FANCY THAT I SEE YOUR GRACE'S CHECK BOOK UPON THE TABLE SAID HE
I
SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD MAKE ME OUT A CHECK FOR SIX THOUSAND POUNDS
IT WOULD BE AS WELL PERHAPS FOR YOU TO CROSS IT
THE CAPITAL AND
COUNTIES BANK OXFORD STREET BRANCH ARE MY AGENTS
HIS GRACE SAT VERY STERN AND UPRIGHT IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED STONILY AT
MY FRIEND
IS THIS A JOKE MR
HOLMES IT IS HARDLY A SUBJECT FOR PLEASANTRY
NOT AT ALL YOUR GRACE
I WAS NEVER MORE EARNEST IN MY LIFE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THEN
I MEAN THAT I HAVE EARNED THE REWARD
I KNOW WHERE YOUR SON IS AND I
KNOW SOME AT LEAST OF THOSE WHO ARE HOLDING HIM
THE DUKE'S BEARD HAD TURNED MORE AGGRESSIVELY RED THAN EVER AGAINST HIS
GHASTLY WHITE FACE
WHERE IS HE HE GASPED
HE IS OR WAS LAST NIGHT AT THE FIGHTING COCK INN ABOUT TWO MILES
FROM YOUR PARK GATE
THE DUKE FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR
AND WHOM DO YOU ACCUSE
SHERLOCK HOLMES'S ANSWER WAS AN ASTOUNDING ONE
HE STEPPED SWIFTLY
FORWARD AND TOUCHED THE DUKE UPON THE SHOULDER
I ACCUSE YOU SAID HE
AND NOW YOUR GRACE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR THAT
CHECK
NEVER SHALL I FORGET THE DUKE'S APPEARANCE AS HE SPRANG UP AND CLAWED
WITH HIS HANDS LIKE ONE WHO IS SINKING INTO AN ABYSS
THEN WITH AN
EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT OF ARISTOCRATIC SELF COMMAND HE SAT DOWN AND SANK
HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
IT WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE HE SPOKE
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW HE ASKED AT LAST WITHOUT RAISING HIS HEAD
I SAW YOU TOGETHER LAST NIGHT
DOES ANYONE ELSE BESIDE YOUR FRIEND KNOW
I HAVE SPOKEN TO NO ONE
THE DUKE TOOK A PEN IN HIS QUIVERING FINGERS AND OPENED HIS CHECK BOOK
I SHALL BE AS GOOD AS MY WORD MR
HOLMES
I AM ABOUT TO WRITE YOUR
CHECK HOWEVER UNWELCOME THE INFORMATION WHICH YOU HAVE GAINED MAY BE
TO ME
WHEN THE OFFER WAS FIRST MADE I LITTLE THOUGHT THE TURN WHICH
EVENTS MIGHT TAKE
BUT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND ARE MEN OF DISCRETION MR
HOLMES
I HARDLY UNDERSTAND YOUR GRACE
I MUST PUT IT PLAINLY MR
HOLMES
IF ONLY YOU TWO KNOW OF THIS
INCIDENT THERE IS NO REASON WHY IT SHOULD GO ANY FARTHER
I THINK
TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS IS THE SUM THAT I OWE YOU IS IT NOT
BUT HOLMES SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
I FEAR YOUR GRACE THAT MATTERS CAN HARDLY BE ARRANGED SO EASILY
THERE IS THE DEATH OF THIS SCHOOLMASTER TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
BUT JAMES KNEW NOTHING OF THAT
YOU CANNOT HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR
THAT
IT WAS THE WORK OF THIS BRUTAL RUFFIAN WHOM HE HAD THE MISFORTUNE
TO EMPLOY
I MUST TAKE THE VIEW YOUR GRACE THAT WHEN A MAN EMBARKS UPON A CRIME
HE IS MORALLY GUILTY OF ANY OTHER CRIME WHICH MAY SPRING FROM IT
MORALLY MR
HOLMES
NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT
BUT SURELY NOT IN THE EYES
OF THE LAW
A MAN CANNOT BE CONDEMNED FOR A MURDER AT WHICH HE WAS NOT
PRESENT AND WHICH HE LOATHES AND ABHORS AS MUCH AS YOU DO
THE INSTANT
THAT HE HEARD OF IT HE MADE A COMPLETE CONFESSION TO ME SO FILLED WAS
HE WITH HORROR AND REMORSE
HE LOST NOT AN HOUR IN BREAKING ENTIRELY
WITH THE MURDERER
OH MR
HOLMES YOU MUST SAVE HIM YOU MUST SAVE
HIM I TELL YOU THAT YOU MUST SAVE HIM THE DUKE HAD DROPPED THE LAST
ATTEMPT AT SELF COMMAND AND WAS PACING THE ROOM WITH A CONVULSED FACE
AND WITH HIS CLENCHED HANDS RAVING IN THE AIR
AT LAST HE MASTERED
HIMSELF AND SAT DOWN ONCE MORE AT HIS DESK
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONDUCT
IN COMING HERE BEFORE YOU SPOKE TO ANYONE ELSE SAID HE
AT LEAST WE
MAY TAKE COUNSEL HOW FAR WE CAN MINIMIZE THIS HIDEOUS SCANDAL
EXACTLY SAID HOLMES
I THINK YOUR GRACE THAT THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE
BY ABSOLUTE FRANKNESS BETWEEN US
I AM DISPOSED TO HELP YOUR GRACE TO
THE BEST OF MY ABILITY BUT IN ORDER TO DO SO I MUST UNDERSTAND TO THE
LAST DETAIL HOW THE MATTER STANDS
I REALIZE THAT YOUR WORDS APPLIED TO
MR
JAMES WILDER AND THAT HE IS NOT THE MURDERER
NO THE MURDERER HAS ESCAPED
SHERLOCK HOLMES SMILED DEMURELY
YOUR GRACE CAN HARDLY HAVE HEARD OF ANY SMALL REPUTATION WHICH I
POSSESS OR YOU WOULD NOT IMAGINE THAT IT IS SO EASY TO ESCAPE ME
MR
REUBEN HAYES WAS ARRESTED AT CHESTERFIELD ON MY INFORMATION AT ELEVEN
O'CLOCK LAST NIGHT
I HAD A TELEGRAM FROM THE HEAD OF THE LOCAL POLICE
BEFORE I LEFT THE SCHOOL THIS MORNING
THE DUKE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND STARED WITH AMAZEMENT AT MY
FRIEND
YOU SEEM TO HAVE POWERS THAT ARE HARDLY HUMAN SAID HE
SO REUBEN
HAYES IS TAKEN I AM RIGHT GLAD TO HEAR IT IF IT WILL NOT REACT UPON
THE FATE OF JAMES
YOUR SECRETARY
NO SIR MY SON
IT WAS HOLMES'S TURN TO LOOK ASTONISHED
I CONFESS THAT THIS IS ENTIRELY NEW TO ME YOUR GRACE
I MUST BEG YOU
TO BE MORE EXPLICIT
I WILL CONCEAL NOTHING FROM YOU
I AGREE WITH YOU THAT COMPLETE
FRANKNESS HOWEVER PAINFUL IT MAY BE TO ME IS THE BEST POLICY IN THIS
DESPERATE SITUATION TO WHICH JAMES'S FOLLY AND JEALOUSY HAVE REDUCED
US
WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG MAN MR
HOLMES I LOVED WITH SUCH A LOVE
AS COMES ONLY ONCE IN A LIFETIME
I OFFERED THE LADY MARRIAGE BUT SHE
REFUSED IT ON THE GROUNDS THAT SUCH A MATCH MIGHT MAR MY CAREER
HAD SHE
LIVED I WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER HAVE MARRIED ANYONE ELSE
SHE DIED AND
LEFT THIS ONE CHILD WHOM FOR HER SAKE I HAVE CHERISHED AND CARED FOR
I COULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE PATERNITY TO THE WORLD BUT I GAVE HIM THE
BEST OF EDUCATIONS AND SINCE HE CAME TO MANHOOD I HAVE KEPT HIM NEAR
MY PERSON
HE SURMISED MY SECRET AND HAS PRESUMED EVER SINCE UPON THE
CLAIM WHICH HE HAS UPON ME AND UPON HIS POWER OF PROVOKING A SCANDAL
WHICH WOULD BE ABHORRENT TO ME
HIS PRESENCE HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE UNHAPPY ISSUE OF MY MARRIAGE
ABOVE ALL HE HATED MY YOUNG
LEGITIMATE HEIR FROM THE FIRST WITH A PERSISTENT HATRED
YOU MAY WELL
ASK ME WHY UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I STILL KEPT JAMES UNDER MY ROOF
I ANSWER THAT IT WAS BECAUSE I COULD SEE HIS MOTHER'S FACE IN HIS AND
THAT FOR HER DEAR SAKE THERE WAS NO END TO MY LONG SUFFERING
ALL HER
PRETTY WAYS TOO THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM WHICH HE COULD NOT SUGGEST
AND BRING BACK TO MY MEMORY
I COULD NOT SEND HIM AWAY
BUT I FEARED SO
MUCH LEST HE SHOULD DO ARTHUR THAT IS LORD SALTIRE A MISCHIEF THAT I
DISPATCHED HIM FOR SAFETY TO DR
HUXTABLE'S SCHOOL
JAMES CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THIS FELLOW HAYES BECAUSE THE MAN WAS A
TENANT OF MINE AND JAMES ACTED AS AGENT
THE FELLOW WAS A RASCAL FROM
THE BEGINNING BUT IN SOME EXTRAORDINARY WAY JAMES BECAME INTIMATE
WITH HIM
HE HAD ALWAYS A TASTE FOR LOW COMPANY
WHEN JAMES DETERMINED
TO KIDNAP LORD SALTIRE IT WAS OF THIS MAN'S SERVICE THAT HE AVAILED
HIMSELF
YOU REMEMBER THAT I WROTE TO ARTHUR UPON THAT LAST DAY
WELL
JAMES OPENED THE LETTER AND INSERTED A NOTE ASKING ARTHUR TO MEET HIM
IN A LITTLE WOOD CALLED THE RAGGED SHAW WHICH IS NEAR TO THE SCHOOL
HE USED THE DUCHESS'S NAME AND IN THAT WAY GOT THE BOY TO COME
THAT
EVENING JAMES BICYCLED OVER I AM TELLING YOU WHAT HE HAS HIMSELF
CONFESSED TO ME AND HE TOLD ARTHUR WHOM HE MET IN THE WOOD THAT HIS
MOTHER LONGED TO SEE HIM THAT SHE WAS AWAITING HIM ON THE MOOR AND
THAT IF HE WOULD COME BACK INTO THE WOOD AT MIDNIGHT HE WOULD FIND A MAN
WITH A HORSE WHO WOULD TAKE HIM TO HER
POOR ARTHUR FELL INTO THE TRAP
HE CAME TO THE APPOINTMENT AND FOUND THIS FELLOW HAYES WITH A LED PONY
ARTHUR MOUNTED AND THEY SET OFF TOGETHER
IT APPEARS THOUGH THIS JAMES
ONLY HEARD YESTERDAY THAT THEY WERE PURSUED THAT HAYES STRUCK THE
PURSUER WITH HIS STICK AND THAT THE MAN DIED OF HIS INJURIES
HAYES
BROUGHT ARTHUR TO HIS PUBLIC HOUSE THE FIGHTING COCK WHERE HE WAS
CONFINED IN AN UPPER ROOM UNDER THE CARE OF MRS
HAYES WHO IS A KINDLY
WOMAN BUT ENTIRELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF HER BRUTAL HUSBAND
WELL MR
HOLMES THAT WAS THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU
TWO DAYS AGO
I HAD NO MORE IDEA OF THE TRUTH THAN YOU
YOU WILL ASK ME
WHAT WAS JAMES'S MOTIVE IN DOING SUCH A DEED
I ANSWER THAT THERE WAS
A GREAT DEAL WHICH WAS UNREASONING AND FANATICAL IN THE HATRED WHICH
HE BORE MY HEIR
IN HIS VIEW HE SHOULD HIMSELF HAVE BEEN HEIR OF ALL
MY ESTATES AND HE DEEPLY RESENTED THOSE SOCIAL LAWS WHICH MADE IT
IMPOSSIBLE
AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD A DEFINITE MOTIVE ALSO
HE WAS
EAGER THAT I SHOULD BREAK THE ENTAIL AND HE WAS OF OPINION THAT IT LAY
IN MY POWER TO DO SO
HE INTENDED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH ME TO RESTORE
ARTHUR IF I WOULD BREAK THE ENTAIL AND SO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE
ESTATE TO BE LEFT TO HIM BY WILL
HE KNEW WELL THAT I SHOULD NEVER
WILLINGLY INVOKE THE AID OF THE POLICE AGAINST HIM
I SAY THAT HE WOULD
HAVE PROPOSED SUCH A BARGAIN TO ME BUT HE DID NOT ACTUALLY DO SO FOR
EVENTS MOVED TOO QUICKLY FOR HIM AND HE HAD NOT TIME TO PUT HIS PLANS
INTO PRACTICE
WHAT BROUGHT ALL HIS WICKED SCHEME TO WRECK WAS YOUR DISCOVERY OF THIS
MAN HEIDEGGER'S DEAD BODY
JAMES WAS SEIZED WITH HORROR AT THE NEWS
IT
CAME TO US YESTERDAY AS WE SAT TOGETHER IN THIS STUDY
DR
HUXTABLE HAD
SENT A TELEGRAM
JAMES WAS SO OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF AND AGITATION THAT
MY SUSPICIONS WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN ENTIRELY ABSENT ROSE INSTANTLY TO
A CERTAINTY AND I TAXED HIM WITH THE DEED
HE MADE A COMPLETE VOLUNTARY
CONFESSION
THEN HE IMPLORED ME TO KEEP HIS SECRET FOR THREE DAYS
LONGER SO AS TO GIVE HIS WRETCHED ACCOMPLICE A CHANCE OF SAVING HIS
GUILTY LIFE
I YIELDED AS I HAVE ALWAYS YIELDED TO HIS PRAYERS AND
INSTANTLY JAMES HURRIED OFF TO THE FIGHTING COCK TO WARN HAYES AND
GIVE HIM THE MEANS OF FLIGHT
I COULD NOT GO THERE BY DAYLIGHT WITHOUT
PROVOKING COMMENT BUT AS SOON AS NIGHT FELL I HURRIED OFF TO SEE MY
DEAR ARTHUR
I FOUND HIM SAFE AND WELL BUT HORRIFIED BEYOND EXPRESSION
BY THE DREADFUL DEED HE HAD WITNESSED
IN DEFERENCE TO MY PROMISE AND
MUCH AGAINST MY WILL I CONSENTED TO LEAVE HIM THERE FOR THREE DAYS
UNDER THE CHARGE OF MRS
HAYES SINCE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO INFORM THE POLICE WHERE HE WAS WITHOUT TELLING THEM ALSO
WHO WAS THE MURDERER AND I COULD NOT SEE HOW THAT MURDERER COULD BE
PUNISHED WITHOUT RUIN TO MY UNFORTUNATE JAMES
YOU ASKED FOR FRANKNESS
MR
HOLMES AND I HAVE TAKEN YOU AT YOUR WORD FOR I HAVE NOW TOLD YOU
EVERYTHING WITHOUT AN ATTEMPT AT CIRCUMLOCUTION OR CONCEALMENT
DO YOU
IN TURN BE AS FRANK WITH ME
I WILL SAID HOLMES
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOUR GRACE I AM BOUND TO
TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE PLACED YOURSELF IN A MOST SERIOUS POSITION IN
THE EYES OF THE LAW
YOU HAVE CONDONED A FELONY AND YOU HAVE AIDED THE
ESCAPE OF A MURDERER FOR I CANNOT DOUBT THAT ANY MONEY WHICH WAS TAKEN
BY JAMES WILDER TO AID HIS ACCOMPLICE IN HIS FLIGHT CAME FROM YOUR
GRACE'S PURSE
THE DUKE BOWED HIS ASSENT
THIS IS INDEED A MOST SERIOUS MATTER
EVEN MORE CULPABLE IN MY
OPINION YOUR GRACE IS YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOUR YOUNGER SON
YOU
LEAVE HIM IN THIS DEN FOR THREE DAYS
UNDER SOLEMN PROMISES
WHAT ARE PROMISES TO SUCH PEOPLE AS THESE YOU HAVE NO GUARANTEE THAT
HE WILL NOT BE SPIRITED AWAY AGAIN
TO HUMOUR YOUR GUILTY ELDER SON
YOU HAVE EXPOSED YOUR INNOCENT YOUNGER SON TO IMMINENT AND UNNECESSARY
DANGER
IT WAS A MOST UNJUSTIFIABLE ACTION
THE PROUD LORD OF HOLDERNESSE WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE SO RATED IN
HIS OWN DUCAL HALL
THE BLOOD FLUSHED INTO HIS HIGH FOREHEAD BUT HIS
CONSCIENCE HELD HIM DUMB
I WILL HELP YOU BUT ON ONE CONDITION ONLY
IT IS THAT YOU RING FOR THE
FOOTMAN AND LET ME GIVE SUCH ORDERS AS I LIKE
WITHOUT A WORD THE DUKE PRESSED THE ELECTRIC BELL
A SERVANT ENTERED
YOU WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR SAID HOLMES THAT YOUR YOUNG MASTER IS
FOUND
IT IS THE DUKE'S DESIRE THAT THE CARRIAGE SHALL GO AT ONCE TO THE
FIGHTING COCK INN TO BRING LORD SALTIRE HOME
NOW SAID HOLMES WHEN THE REJOICING LACKEY HAD DISAPPEARED HAVING
SECURED THE FUTURE WE CAN AFFORD TO BE MORE LENIENT WITH THE PAST
I AM
NOT IN AN OFFICIAL POSITION AND THERE IS NO REASON SO LONG AS THE
ENDS OF JUSTICE ARE SERVED WHY I SHOULD DISCLOSE ALL THAT I KNOW
AS TO
HAYES I SAY NOTHING
THE GALLOWS AWAITS HIM AND I WOULD DO NOTHING
TO SAVE HIM FROM IT
WHAT HE WILL DIVULGE I CANNOT TELL BUT I HAVE
NO DOUBT THAT YOUR GRACE COULD MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS TO HIS
INTEREST TO BE SILENT
FROM THE POLICE POINT OF VIEW HE WILL HAVE
KIDNAPPED THE BOY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RANSOM
IF THEY DO NOT THEMSELVES
FIND IT OUT I SEE NO REASON WHY I SHOULD PROMPT THEM TO TAKE A BROADER
POINT OF VIEW
I WOULD WARN YOUR GRACE HOWEVER THAT THE CONTINUED
PRESENCE OF MR
JAMES WILDER IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD CAN ONLY LEAD TO
MISFORTUNE
I UNDERSTAND THAT MR
HOLMES AND IT IS ALREADY SETTLED THAT HE SHALL
LEAVE ME FOREVER AND GO TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE IN AUSTRALIA
IN THAT CASE YOUR GRACE SINCE YOU HAVE YOURSELF STATED THAT ANY
UNHAPPINESS IN YOUR MARRIED LIFE WAS CAUSED BY HIS PRESENCE I WOULD
SUGGEST THAT YOU MAKE SUCH AMENDS AS YOU CAN TO THE DUCHESS AND
THAT YOU TRY TO RESUME THOSE RELATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO UNHAPPILY
INTERRUPTED
THAT ALSO I HAVE ARRANGED MR
HOLMES
I WROTE TO THE DUCHESS THIS
MORNING
IN THAT CASE SAID HOLMES RISING I THINK THAT MY FRIEND AND I CAN
CONGRATULATE OURSELVES UPON SEVERAL MOST HAPPY RESULTS FROM OUR LITTLE
VISIT TO THE NORTH
THERE IS ONE OTHER SMALL POINT UPON WHICH I DESIRE
SOME LIGHT
THIS FELLOW HAYES HAD SHOD HIS HORSES WITH SHOES WHICH
COUNTERFEITED THE TRACKS OF COWS
WAS IT FROM MR
WILDER THAT HE LEARNED
SO EXTRAORDINARY A DEVICE
THE DUKE STOOD IN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT WITH A LOOK OF INTENSE SURPRISE
ON HIS FACE
THEN HE OPENED A DOOR AND SHOWED US INTO A LARGE ROOM
FURNISHED AS A MUSEUM
HE LED THE WAY TO A GLASS CASE IN A CORNER AND
POINTED TO THE INSCRIPTION
THESE SHOES IT RAN WERE DUG UP IN THE MOAT OF HOLDERNESSE HALL
THEY ARE FOR THE USE OF HORSES BUT THEY ARE SHAPED BELOW WITH A CLOVEN
FOOT OF IRON SO AS TO THROW PURSUERS OFF THE TRACK
THEY ARE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE BELONGED TO SOME OF THE MARAUDING BARONS OF HOLDERNESSE IN THE
MIDDLE AGES
HOLMES OPENED THE CASE AND MOISTENING HIS FINGER HE PASSED IT ALONG THE
SHOE
A THIN FILM OF RECENT MUD WAS LEFT UPON HIS SKIN
THANK YOU SAID HE AS HE REPLACED THE GLASS
IT IS THE SECOND MOST
INTERESTING OBJECT THAT I HAVE SEEN IN THE NORTH
AND THE FIRST
HOLMES FOLDED UP HIS CHECK AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN HIS NOTEBOOK
I
AM A POOR MAN SAID HE AS HE PATTED IT AFFECTIONATELY AND THRUST IT
INTO THE DEPTHS OF HIS INNER POCKET
THE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN MY FRIEND TO BE IN BETTER FORM BOTH MENTAL AND
PHYSICAL THAN IN THE YEAR '95
HIS INCREASING FAME HAD BROUGHT WITH IT
AN IMMENSE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD BE GUILTY OF AN INDISCRETION IF I
WERE EVEN TO HINT AT THE IDENTITY OF SOME OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENTS WHO
CROSSED OUR HUMBLE THRESHOLD IN BAKER STREET
HOLMES HOWEVER LIKE ALL
GREAT ARTISTS LIVED FOR HIS ART'S SAKE AND SAVE IN THE CASE OF THE
DUKE OF HOLDERNESSE I HAVE SELDOM KNOWN HIM CLAIM ANY LARGE REWARD FOR
HIS INESTIMABLE SERVICES
SO UNWORLDLY WAS HE OR SO CAPRICIOUS THAT
HE FREQUENTLY REFUSED HIS HELP TO THE POWERFUL AND WEALTHY WHERE THE
PROBLEM MADE NO APPEAL TO HIS SYMPATHIES WHILE HE WOULD DEVOTE WEEKS OF
MOST INTENSE APPLICATION TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOME HUMBLE CLIENT WHOSE CASE
PRESENTED THOSE STRANGE AND DRAMATIC QUALITIES WHICH APPEALED TO HIS
IMAGINATION AND CHALLENGED HIS INGENUITY
IN THIS MEMORABLE YEAR '95 A CURIOUS AND INCONGRUOUS SUCCESSION OF
CASES HAD ENGAGED HIS ATTENTION RANGING FROM HIS FAMOUS INVESTIGATION
OF THE SUDDEN DEATH OF CARDINAL TOSCA AN INQUIRY WHICH WAS CARRIED
OUT BY HIM AT THE EXPRESS DESIRE OF HIS HOLINESS THE POPE DOWN TO
HIS ARREST OF WILSON THE NOTORIOUS CANARY TRAINER WHICH REMOVED A
PLAGUE SPOT FROM THE EAST END OF LONDON
CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THESE
TWO FAMOUS CASES CAME THE TRAGEDY OF WOODMAN'S LEE AND THE VERY OBSCURE
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SURROUNDED THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN PETER CAREY
NO
RECORD OF THE DOINGS OF MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES WOULD BE COMPLETE WHICH DID
NOT INCLUDE SOME ACCOUNT OF THIS VERY UNUSUAL AFFAIR
DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY MY FRIEND HAD BEEN ABSENT SO OFTEN AND
SO LONG FROM OUR LODGINGS THAT I KNEW HE HAD SOMETHING ON HAND
THE FACT
THAT SEVERAL ROUGH LOOKING MEN CALLED DURING THAT TIME AND INQUIRED FOR
CAPTAIN BASIL MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT HOLMES WAS WORKING SOMEWHERE UNDER
ONE OF THE NUMEROUS DISGUISES AND NAMES WITH WHICH HE CONCEALED HIS OWN
FORMIDABLE IDENTITY
HE HAD AT LEAST FIVE SMALL REFUGES IN DIFFERENT
PARTS OF LONDON IN WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO CHANGE HIS PERSONALITY
HE
SAID NOTHING OF HIS BUSINESS TO ME AND IT WAS NOT MY HABIT TO FORCE A
CONFIDENCE
THE FIRST POSITIVE SIGN WHICH HE GAVE ME OF THE DIRECTION
WHICH HIS INVESTIGATION WAS TAKING WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY ONE
HE HAD GONE
OUT BEFORE BREAKFAST AND I HAD SAT DOWN TO MINE WHEN HE STRODE INTO THE
ROOM HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD AND A HUGE BARBED HEADED SPEAR TUCKED LIKE
AN UMBRELLA UNDER HIS ARM
GOOD GRACIOUS HOLMES I CRIED
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE
BEEN WALKING ABOUT LONDON WITH THAT THING
I DROVE TO THE BUTCHER'S AND BACK
THE BUTCHER'S
AND I RETURN WITH AN EXCELLENT APPETITE
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION
MY DEAR WATSON OF THE VALUE OF EXERCISE BEFORE BREAKFAST
BUT I AM
PREPARED TO BET THAT YOU WILL NOT GUESS THE FORM THAT MY EXERCISE HAS
TAKEN
I WILL NOT ATTEMPT IT
HE CHUCKLED AS HE POURED OUT THE COFFEE
IF YOU COULD HAVE LOOKED INTO ALLARDYCE'S BACK SHOP YOU WOULD HAVE
SEEN A DEAD PIG SWUNG FROM A HOOK IN THE CEILING AND A GENTLEMAN IN
HIS SHIRT SLEEVES FURIOUSLY STABBING AT IT WITH THIS WEAPON
I WAS THAT
ENERGETIC PERSON AND I HAVE SATISFIED MYSELF THAT BY NO EXERTION OF MY
STRENGTH CAN I TRANSFIX THE PIG WITH A SINGLE BLOW
PERHAPS YOU WOULD
CARE TO TRY
NOT FOR WORLDS
BUT WHY WERE YOU DOING THIS
BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO ME TO HAVE AN INDIRECT BEARING UPON THE MYSTERY OF
WOODMAN'S LEE
AH HOPKINS I GOT YOUR WIRE LAST NIGHT AND I HAVE BEEN
EXPECTING YOU
COME AND JOIN US
OUR VISITOR WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY ALERT MAN THIRTY YEARS OF AGE DRESSED
IN A QUIET TWEED SUIT BUT RETAINING THE ERECT BEARING OF ONE WHO WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO OFFICIAL UNIFORM
I RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE AS STANLEY
HOPKINS A YOUNG POLICE INSPECTOR FOR WHOSE FUTURE HOLMES HAD HIGH
HOPES WHILE HE IN TURN PROFESSED THE ADMIRATION AND RESPECT OF A PUPIL
FOR THE SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF THE FAMOUS AMATEUR
HOPKINS'S BROW WAS
CLOUDED AND HE SAT DOWN WITH AN AIR OF DEEP DEJECTION
NO THANK YOU SIR
I BREAKFASTED BEFORE I CAME ROUND
I SPENT THE
NIGHT IN TOWN FOR I CAME UP YESTERDAY TO REPORT
AND WHAT HAD YOU TO REPORT
FAILURE SIR ABSOLUTE FAILURE
YOU HAVE MADE NO PROGRESS
NONE
DEAR ME I MUST HAVE A LOOK AT THE MATTER
I WISH TO HEAVENS THAT YOU WOULD MR
HOLMES
IT'S MY FIRST BIG CHANCE
AND I AM AT MY WIT'S END
FOR GOODNESS' SAKE COME DOWN AND LEND ME A
HAND
WELL WELL IT JUST HAPPENS THAT I HAVE ALREADY READ ALL THE AVAILABLE
EVIDENCE INCLUDING THE REPORT OF THE INQUEST WITH SOME CARE
BY THE
WAY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT TOBACCO POUCH FOUND ON THE SCENE OF THE
CRIME IS THERE NO CLUE THERE
HOPKINS LOOKED SURPRISED
IT WAS THE MAN'S OWN POUCH SIR
HIS INITIALS WERE INSIDE IT
AND IT
WAS OF SEALSKIN AND HE WAS AN OLD SEALER
BUT HE HAD NO PIPE
NO SIR WE COULD FIND NO PIPE
INDEED HE SMOKED VERY LITTLE AND YET
HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT SOME TOBACCO FOR HIS FRIENDS
NO DOUBT
I ONLY MENTION IT BECAUSE IF I HAD BEEN HANDLING THE CASE
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO MAKE THAT THE STARTING POINT OF MY
INVESTIGATION
HOWEVER MY FRIEND DR
WATSON KNOWS NOTHING OF THIS
MATTER AND I SHOULD BE NONE THE WORSE FOR HEARING THE SEQUENCE OF
EVENTS ONCE MORE
JUST GIVE US SOME SHORT SKETCHES OF THE ESSENTIALS
STANLEY HOPKINS DREW A SLIP OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET
I HAVE A FEW DATES HERE WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE CAREER OF THE DEAD MAN
CAPTAIN PETER CAREY
HE WAS BORN IN '45 FIFTY YEARS OF AGE
HE WAS A
MOST DARING AND SUCCESSFUL SEAL AND WHALE FISHER
IN 1883 HE COMMANDED
THE STEAM SEALER SEA UNICORN OF DUNDEE
HE HAD THEN HAD SEVERAL
SUCCESSFUL VOYAGES IN SUCCESSION AND IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR 1884 HE
RETIRED
AFTER THAT HE TRAVELLED FOR SOME YEARS AND FINALLY HE BOUGHT
A SMALL PLACE CALLED WOODMAN'S LEE NEAR FOREST ROW IN SUSSEX
THERE HE
HAS LIVED FOR SIX YEARS AND THERE HE DIED JUST A WEEK AGO TO DAY
THERE WERE SOME MOST SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT THE MAN
IN ORDINARY
LIFE HE WAS A STRICT PURITAN A SILENT GLOOMY FELLOW
HIS HOUSEHOLD
CONSISTED OF HIS WIFE HIS DAUGHTER AGED TWENTY AND TWO FEMALE
SERVANTS
THESE LAST WERE CONTINUALLY CHANGING FOR IT WAS NEVER A VERY
CHEERY SITUATION AND SOMETIMES IT BECAME PAST ALL BEARING
THE MAN
WAS AN INTERMITTENT DRUNKARD AND WHEN HE HAD THE FIT ON HIM HE WAS A
PERFECT FIEND
HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DRIVE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER OUT OF
DOORS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND FLOG THEM THROUGH THE PARK UNTIL
THE WHOLE VILLAGE OUTSIDE THE GATES WAS AROUSED BY THEIR SCREAMS
HE WAS SUMMONED ONCE FOR A SAVAGE ASSAULT UPON THE OLD VICAR WHO HAD
CALLED UPON HIM TO REMONSTRATE WITH HIM UPON HIS CONDUCT
IN SHORT
MR
HOLMES YOU WOULD GO FAR BEFORE YOU FOUND A MORE DANGEROUS MAN THAN
PETER CAREY AND I HAVE HEARD THAT HE BORE THE SAME CHARACTER WHEN HE
COMMANDED HIS SHIP
HE WAS KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS BLACK PETER AND THE
NAME WAS GIVEN HIM NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SWARTHY FEATURES AND THE
COLOUR OF HIS HUGE BEARD BUT FOR THE HUMOURS WHICH WERE THE TERROR OF
ALL AROUND HIM
I NEED NOT SAY THAT HE WAS LOATHED AND AVOIDED BY EVERY
ONE OF HIS NEIGHBOURS AND THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE SINGLE WORD OF
SORROW ABOUT HIS TERRIBLE END
YOU MUST HAVE READ IN THE ACCOUNT OF THE INQUEST ABOUT THE MAN'S CABIN
MR
HOLMES BUT PERHAPS YOUR FRIEND HERE HAS NOT HEARD OF IT
HE HAD
BUILT HIMSELF A WOODEN OUTHOUSE HE ALWAYS CALLED IT THE 'CABIN' A FEW
HUNDRED YARDS FROM HIS HOUSE AND IT WAS HERE THAT HE SLEPT EVERY NIGHT
IT WAS A LITTLE SINGLE ROOMED HUT SIXTEEN FEET BY TEN
HE KEPT THE
KEY IN HIS POCKET MADE HIS OWN BED CLEANED IT HIMSELF AND ALLOWED NO
OTHER FOOT TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD
THERE ARE SMALL WINDOWS ON EACH SIDE
WHICH WERE COVERED BY CURTAINS AND NEVER OPENED
ONE OF THESE WINDOWS
WAS TURNED TOWARDS THE HIGH ROAD AND WHEN THE LIGHT BURNED IN IT AT
NIGHT THE FOLK USED TO POINT IT OUT TO EACH OTHER AND WONDER WHAT BLACK
PETER WAS DOING IN THERE
THAT'S THE WINDOW MR
HOLMES WHICH GAVE US
ONE OF THE FEW BITS OF POSITIVE EVIDENCE THAT CAME OUT AT THE INQUEST
YOU REMEMBER THAT A STONEMASON NAMED SLATER WALKING FROM FOREST ROW
ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TWO DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER STOPPED
AS HE PASSED THE GROUNDS AND LOOKED AT THE SQUARE OF LIGHT STILL SHINING
AMONG THE TREES
HE SWEARS THAT THE SHADOW OF A MAN'S HEAD TURNED
SIDEWAYS WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE ON THE BLIND AND THAT THIS SHADOW WAS
CERTAINLY NOT THAT OF PETER CAREY WHOM HE KNEW WELL
IT WAS THAT OF A
BEARDED MAN BUT THE BEARD WAS SHORT AND BRISTLED FORWARD IN A WAY VERY
DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE CAPTAIN
SO HE SAYS BUT HE HAD BEEN TWO
HOURS IN THE PUBLIC HOUSE AND IT IS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE ROAD TO THE
WINDOW
BESIDES THIS REFERS TO THE MONDAY AND THE CRIME WAS DONE UPON
THE WEDNESDAY
ON THE TUESDAY PETER CAREY WAS IN ONE OF HIS BLACKEST MOODS FLUSHED
WITH DRINK AND AS SAVAGE AS A DANGEROUS WILD BEAST
HE ROAMED ABOUT THE
HOUSE AND THE WOMEN RAN FOR IT WHEN THEY HEARD HIM COMING
LATE IN THE
EVENING HE WENT DOWN TO HIS OWN HUT
ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING
MORNING HIS DAUGHTER WHO SLEPT WITH HER WINDOW OPEN HEARD A MOST
FEARFUL YELL FROM THAT DIRECTION BUT IT WAS NO UNUSUAL THING FOR HIM TO
BAWL AND SHOUT WHEN HE WAS IN DRINK SO NO NOTICE WAS TAKEN
ON RISING
AT SEVEN ONE OF THE MAIDS NOTICED THAT THE DOOR OF THE HUT WAS OPEN
BUT SO GREAT WAS THE TERROR WHICH THE MAN CAUSED THAT IT WAS MIDDAY
BEFORE ANYONE WOULD VENTURE DOWN TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM
PEEPING
INTO THE OPEN DOOR THEY SAW A SIGHT WHICH SENT THEM FLYING WITH WHITE
FACES INTO THE VILLAGE
WITHIN AN HOUR I WAS ON THE SPOT AND HAD TAKEN
OVER THE CASE
WELL I HAVE FAIRLY STEADY NERVES AS YOU KNOW MR
HOLMES BUT I GIVE
YOU MY WORD THAT I GOT A SHAKE WHEN I PUT MY HEAD INTO THAT LITTLE
HOUSE
IT WAS DRONING LIKE A HARMONIUM WITH THE FLIES AND BLUEBOTTLES
AND THE FLOOR AND WALLS WERE LIKE A SLAUGHTER HOUSE
HE HAD CALLED IT A
CABIN AND A CABIN IT WAS SURE ENOUGH FOR YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE IN A SHIP
THERE WAS A BUNK AT ONE END A SEA CHEST MAPS AND
CHARTS A PICTURE OF THE SEA UNICORN A LINE OF LOGBOOKS ON A SHELF ALL
EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND IT IN A CAPTAIN'S ROOM
AND THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WAS THE MAN HIMSELF HIS FACE TWISTED LIKE A LOST
SOUL IN TORMENT AND HIS GREAT BRINDLED BEARD STUCK UPWARD IN HIS AGONY
RIGHT THROUGH HIS BROAD BREAST A STEEL HARPOON HAD BEEN DRIVEN AND IT
HAD SUNK DEEP INTO THE WOOD OF THE WALL BEHIND HIM
HE WAS PINNED LIKE A
BEETLE ON A CARD
OF COURSE HE WAS QUITE DEAD AND HAD BEEN SO FROM THE
INSTANT THAT HE HAD UTTERED THAT LAST YELL OF AGONY
I KNOW YOUR METHODS SIR AND I APPLIED THEM
BEFORE I PERMITTED
ANYTHING TO BE MOVED I EXAMINED MOST CAREFULLY THE GROUND OUTSIDE AND
ALSO THE FLOOR OF THE ROOM
THERE WERE NO FOOTMARKS
MEANING THAT YOU SAW NONE
I ASSURE YOU SIR THAT THERE WERE NONE
MY GOOD HOPKINS I HAVE INVESTIGATED MANY CRIMES BUT I HAVE NEVER
YET SEEN ONE WHICH WAS COMMITTED BY A FLYING CREATURE
AS LONG AS THE
CRIMINAL REMAINS UPON TWO LEGS SO LONG MUST THERE BE SOME INDENTATION
SOME ABRASION SOME TRIFLING DISPLACEMENT WHICH CAN BE DETECTED BY THE
SCIENTIFIC SEARCHER
IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THIS BLOOD BESPATTERED ROOM
CONTAINED NO TRACE WHICH COULD HAVE AIDED US
I UNDERSTAND HOWEVER
FROM THE INQUEST THAT THERE WERE SOME OBJECTS WHICH YOU FAILED TO
OVERLOOK
THE YOUNG INSPECTOR WINCED AT MY COMPANION'S IRONICAL COMMENTS
I WAS A FOOL NOT TO CALL YOU IN AT THE TIME MR
HOLMES
HOWEVER THAT'S
PAST PRAYING FOR NOW
YES THERE WERE SEVERAL OBJECTS IN THE ROOM WHICH
CALLED FOR SPECIAL ATTENTION
ONE WAS THE HARPOON WITH WHICH THE DEED
WAS COMMITTED
IT HAD BEEN SNATCHED DOWN FROM A RACK ON THE WALL
TWO
OTHERS REMAINED THERE AND THERE WAS A VACANT PLACE FOR THE THIRD
ON THE STOCK WAS ENGRAVED 'SS
SEA UNICORN DUNDEE THIS SEEMED TO
ESTABLISH THAT THE CRIME HAD BEEN DONE IN A MOMENT OF FURY AND THAT
THE MURDERER HAD SEIZED THE FIRST WEAPON WHICH CAME IN HIS WAY
THE FACT
THAT THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED AT TWO IN THE MORNING AND YET PETER
CAREY WAS FULLY DRESSED SUGGESTED THAT HE HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE
MURDERER WHICH IS BORNE OUT BY THE FACT THAT A BOTTLE OF RUM AND TWO
DIRTY GLASSES STOOD UPON THE TABLE
YES SAID HOLMES I THINK THAT BOTH INFERENCES ARE PERMISSIBLE
WAS
THERE ANY OTHER SPIRIT BUT RUM IN THE ROOM
YES THERE WAS A TANTALUS CONTAINING BRANDY AND WHISKY ON THE
SEA CHEST
IT IS OF NO IMPORTANCE TO US HOWEVER SINCE THE DECANTERS
WERE FULL AND IT HAD THEREFORE NOT BEEN USED
FOR ALL THAT ITS PRESENCE HAS SOME SIGNIFICANCE SAID HOLMES
HOWEVER LET US HEAR SOME MORE ABOUT THE OBJECTS WHICH DO SEEM TO YOU
TO BEAR UPON THE CASE
THERE WAS THIS TOBACCO POUCH UPON THE TABLE
WHAT PART OF THE TABLE
IT LAY IN THE MIDDLE
IT WAS OF COARSE SEALSKIN THE STRAIGHT HAIRED
SKIN WITH A LEATHER THONG TO BIND IT
INSIDE WAS 'P C ON THE FLAP
THERE WAS HALF AN OUNCE OF STRONG SHIP'S TOBACCO IN IT
EXCELLENT WHAT MORE
STANLEY HOPKINS DREW FROM HIS POCKET A DRAB COVERED NOTEBOOK
THE
OUTSIDE WAS ROUGH AND WORN THE LEAVES DISCOLOURED
ON THE FIRST PAGE
WERE WRITTEN THE INITIALS J H N AND THE DATE 1883 HOLMES LAID
IT ON THE TABLE AND EXAMINED IT IN HIS MINUTE WAY WHILE HOPKINS AND I
GAZED OVER EACH SHOULDER
ON THE SECOND PAGE WERE THE PRINTED LETTERS
C P R AND THEN CAME SEVERAL SHEETS OF NUMBERS
ANOTHER HEADING WAS
ARGENTINE ANOTHER COSTA RICA AND ANOTHER SAN PAULO EACH WITH
PAGES OF SIGNS AND FIGURES AFTER IT
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE ASKED HOLMES
THEY APPEAR TO BE LISTS OF STOCK EXCHANGE SECURITIES
I THOUGHT THAT
'J H N WERE THE INITIALS OF A BROKER AND THAT 'C P R MAY HAVE BEEN
HIS CLIENT
TRY CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY SAID HOLMES
STANLEY HOPKINS SWORE BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND STRUCK HIS THIGH WITH HIS
CLENCHED HAND
WHAT A FOOL I HAVE BEEN HE CRIED
OF COURSE IT IS AS YOU SAY
THEN
'J H N ARE THE ONLY INITIALS WE HAVE TO SOLVE
I HAVE ALREADY EXAMINED
THE OLD STOCK EXCHANGE LISTS AND I CAN FIND NO ONE IN 1883 EITHER IN
THE HOUSE OR AMONG THE OUTSIDE BROKERS WHOSE INITIALS CORRESPOND WITH
THESE
YET I FEEL THAT THE CLUE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE THAT I HOLD
YOU WILL ADMIT MR
HOLMES THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THESE
INITIALS ARE THOSE OF THE SECOND PERSON WHO WAS PRESENT IN OTHER WORDS
OF THE MURDERER
I WOULD ALSO URGE THAT THE INTRODUCTION INTO THE CASE
OF A DOCUMENT RELATING TO LARGE MASSES OF VALUABLE SECURITIES GIVES US
FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME INDICATION OF A MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME
SHERLOCK HOLMES'S FACE SHOWED THAT HE WAS THOROUGHLY TAKEN ABACK BY THIS
NEW DEVELOPMENT
I MUST ADMIT BOTH YOUR POINTS SAID HE
I CONFESS THAT THIS NOTEBOOK
WHICH DID NOT APPEAR AT THE INQUEST MODIFIES ANY VIEWS WHICH I MAY HAVE
FORMED
I HAD COME TO A THEORY OF THE CRIME IN WHICH I CAN FIND NO
PLACE FOR THIS
HAVE YOU ENDEAVOURED TO TRACE ANY OF THE SECURITIES HERE
MENTIONED
INQUIRIES ARE NOW BEING MADE AT THE OFFICES BUT I FEAR THAT THE
COMPLETE REGISTER OF THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THESE SOUTH AMERICAN CONCERNS
IS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND THAT SOME WEEKS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE WE CAN TRACE
THE SHARES
HOLMES HAD BEEN EXAMINING THE COVER OF THE NOTEBOOK WITH HIS MAGNIFYING
LENS
SURELY THERE IS SOME DISCOLOURATION HERE SAID HE
YES SIR IT IS A BLOOD STAIN
I TOLD YOU THAT I PICKED THE BOOK OFF
THE FLOOR
WAS THE BLOOD STAIN ABOVE OR BELOW
ON THE SIDE NEXT THE BOARDS
WHICH PROVES OF COURSE THAT THE BOOK WAS DROPPED AFTER THE CRIME WAS
COMMITTED
EXACTLY MR
HOLMES
I APPRECIATED THAT POINT AND I CONJECTURED THAT
IT WAS DROPPED BY THE MURDERER IN HIS HURRIED FLIGHT
IT LAY NEAR THE
DOOR
I SUPPOSE THAT NONE OF THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN FOUND AMONG THE
PROPERTY OF THE DEAD MAN
NO SIR
HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO SUSPECT ROBBERY
NO SIR
NOTHING SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED
DEAR ME IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY INTERESTING CASE
THEN THERE WAS A
KNIFE WAS THERE NOT
A SHEATH KNIFE STILL IN ITS SHEATH
IT LAY AT THE FEET OF THE DEAD
MAN
MRS
CAREY HAS IDENTIFIED IT AS BEING HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY
HOLMES WAS LOST IN THOUGHT FOR SOME TIME
WELL SAID HE AT LAST I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO COME OUT AND HAVE A
LOOK AT IT
STANLEY HOPKINS GAVE A CRY OF JOY
THANK YOU SIR
THAT WILL INDEED BE A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND
HOLMES SHOOK HIS FINGER AT THE INSPECTOR
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASIER TASK A WEEK AGO SAID HE
BUT EVEN NOW
MY VISIT MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY FRUITLESS
WATSON IF YOU CAN SPARE
THE TIME I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF YOUR COMPANY
IF YOU WILL CALL A
FOUR WHEELER HOPKINS WE SHALL BE READY TO START FOR FOREST ROW IN A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR
ALIGHTING AT THE SMALL WAYSIDE STATION WE DROVE FOR SOME MILES THROUGH
THE REMAINS OF WIDESPREAD WOODS WHICH WERE ONCE PART OF THAT
GREAT FOREST WHICH FOR SO LONG HELD THE SAXON INVADERS AT BAY THE
IMPENETRABLE WEALD FOR SIXTY YEARS THE BULWARK OF BRITAIN
VAST
SECTIONS OF IT HAVE BEEN CLEARED FOR THIS IS THE SEAT OF THE FIRST
IRON WORKS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE TREES HAVE BEEN FELLED TO SMELT THE
ORE
NOW THE RICHER FIELDS OF THE NORTH HAVE ABSORBED THE TRADE AND
NOTHING SAVE THESE RAVAGED GROVES AND GREAT SCARS IN THE EARTH SHOW THE
WORK OF THE PAST
HERE IN A CLEARING UPON THE GREEN SLOPE OF A HILL
STOOD A LONG LOW STONE HOUSE APPROACHED BY A CURVING DRIVE RUNNING
THROUGH THE FIELDS
NEARER THE ROAD AND SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES BY
BUSHES WAS A SMALL OUTHOUSE ONE WINDOW AND THE DOOR FACING IN OUR
DIRECTION
IT WAS THE SCENE OF THE MURDER
STANLEY HOPKINS LED US FIRST TO THE HOUSE WHERE HE INTRODUCED US TO A
HAGGARD GRAY HAIRED WOMAN THE WIDOW OF THE MURDERED MAN WHOSE GAUNT
AND DEEP LINED FACE WITH THE FURTIVE LOOK OF TERROR IN THE DEPTHS OF
HER RED RIMMED EYES TOLD OF THE YEARS OF HARDSHIP AND ILL USAGE WHICH
SHE HAD ENDURED
WITH HER WAS HER DAUGHTER A PALE FAIR HAIRED GIRL
WHOSE EYES BLAZED DEFIANTLY AT US AS SHE TOLD US THAT SHE WAS GLAD THAT
HER FATHER WAS DEAD AND THAT SHE BLESSED THE HAND WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM
DOWN
IT WAS A TERRIBLE HOUSEHOLD THAT BLACK PETER CAREY HAD MADE FOR
HIMSELF AND IT WAS WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE FOUND OURSELVES IN
THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN AND MAKING OUR WAY ALONG A PATH WHICH HAD BEEN WORN
ACROSS THE FIELDS BY THE FEET OF THE DEAD MAN
THE OUTHOUSE WAS THE SIMPLEST OF DWELLINGS WOODEN WALLED
SHINGLE ROOFED ONE WINDOW BESIDE THE DOOR AND ONE ON THE FARTHER SIDE
STANLEY HOPKINS DREW THE KEY FROM HIS POCKET AND HAD STOOPED TO THE
LOCK WHEN HE PAUSED WITH A LOOK OF ATTENTION AND SURPRISE UPON HIS
FACE
SOMEONE HAS BEEN TAMPERING WITH IT HE SAID
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OF THE FACT
THE WOODWORK WAS CUT AND THE
SCRATCHES SHOWED WHITE THROUGH THE PAINT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THAT
INSTANT DONE
HOLMES HAD BEEN EXAMINING THE WINDOW
SOMEONE HAS TRIED TO FORCE THIS ALSO
WHOEVER IT WAS HAS FAILED TO MAKE
HIS WAY IN
HE MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY POOR BURGLAR
THIS IS A MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING SAID THE INSPECTOR I COULD SWEAR
THAT THESE MARKS WERE NOT HERE YESTERDAY EVENING
SOME CURIOUS PERSON FROM THE VILLAGE PERHAPS I SUGGESTED
VERY UNLIKELY
FEW OF THEM WOULD DARE TO SET FOOT IN THE GROUNDS FAR
LESS TRY TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE CABIN
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT MR
HOLMES
I THINK THAT FORTUNE IS VERY KIND TO US
YOU MEAN THAT THE PERSON WILL COME AGAIN
IT IS VERY PROBABLE
HE CAME EXPECTING TO FIND THE DOOR OPEN
HE TRIED
TO GET IN WITH THE BLADE OF A VERY SMALL PENKNIFE
HE COULD NOT MANAGE
IT
WHAT WOULD HE DO
COME AGAIN NEXT NIGHT WITH A MORE USEFUL TOOL
SO I SHOULD SAY
IT WILL BE OUR FAULT IF WE ARE NOT THERE TO RECEIVE
HIM
MEANWHILE LET ME SEE THE INSIDE OF THE CABIN
THE TRACES OF THE TRAGEDY HAD BEEN REMOVED BUT THE FURNITURE WITHIN THE
LITTLE ROOM STILL STOOD AS IT HAD BEEN ON THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME
FOR
TWO HOURS WITH MOST INTENSE CONCENTRATION HOLMES EXAMINED EVERY OBJECT
IN TURN BUT HIS FACE SHOWED THAT HIS QUEST WAS NOT A SUCCESSFUL ONE
ONCE ONLY HE PAUSED IN HIS PATIENT INVESTIGATION
HAVE YOU TAKEN ANYTHING OFF THIS SHELF HOPKINS
NO I HAVE MOVED NOTHING
SOMETHING HAS BEEN TAKEN
THERE IS LESS DUST IN THIS CORNER OF THE
SHELF THAN ELSEWHERE
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A BOOK LYING ON ITS SIDE
IT MAY
HAVE BEEN A BOX
WELL WELL I CAN DO NOTHING MORE
LET US WALK IN
THESE BEAUTIFUL WOODS WATSON AND GIVE A FEW HOURS TO THE BIRDS AND THE
FLOWERS
WE SHALL MEET YOU HERE LATER HOPKINS AND SEE IF WE CAN COME
TO CLOSER QUARTERS WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS PAID THIS VISIT IN THE
NIGHT
IT WAS PAST ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE FORMED OUR LITTLE AMBUSCADE
HOPKINS
WAS FOR LEAVING THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPEN BUT HOLMES WAS OF THE OPINION
THAT THIS WOULD ROUSE THE SUSPICIONS OF THE STRANGER
THE LOCK WAS A
PERFECTLY SIMPLE ONE AND ONLY A STRONG BLADE WAS NEEDED TO PUSH IT
BACK
HOLMES ALSO SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD WAIT NOT INSIDE THE HUT
BUT OUTSIDE IT AMONG THE BUSHES WHICH GREW ROUND THE FARTHER WINDOW
IN THIS WAY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WATCH OUR MAN IF HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND
SEE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS IN THIS STEALTHY NOCTURNAL VISIT
IT WAS A LONG AND MELANCHOLY VIGIL AND YET BROUGHT WITH IT SOMETHING
OF THE THRILL WHICH THE HUNTER FEELS WHEN HE LIES BESIDE THE WATER POOL
AND WAITS FOR THE COMING OF THE THIRSTY BEAST OF PREY
WHAT SAVAGE
CREATURE WAS IT WHICH MIGHT STEAL UPON US OUT OF THE DARKNESS WAS IT
A FIERCE TIGER OF CRIME WHICH COULD ONLY BE TAKEN FIGHTING HARD WITH
FLASHING FANG AND CLAW OR WOULD IT PROVE TO BE SOME SKULKING JACKAL
DANGEROUS ONLY TO THE WEAK AND UNGUARDED
IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE WE CROUCHED AMONGST THE BUSHES WAITING FOR WHATEVER
MIGHT COME
AT FIRST THE STEPS OF A FEW BELATED VILLAGERS OR THE SOUND
OF VOICES FROM THE VILLAGE LIGHTENED OUR VIGIL BUT ONE BY ONE THESE
INTERRUPTIONS DIED AWAY AND AN ABSOLUTE STILLNESS FELL UPON US SAVE
FOR THE CHIMES OF THE DISTANT CHURCH WHICH TOLD US OF THE PROGRESS OF
THE NIGHT AND FOR THE RUSTLE AND WHISPER OF A FINE RAIN FALLING AMID
THE FOLIAGE WHICH ROOFED US IN
HALF PAST TWO HAD CHIMED AND IT WAS THE DARKEST HOUR WHICH PRECEDES
THE DAWN WHEN WE ALL STARTED AS A LOW BUT SHARP CLICK CAME FROM THE
DIRECTION OF THE GATE
SOMEONE HAD ENTERED THE DRIVE
AGAIN THERE WAS A
LONG SILENCE AND I HAD BEGUN TO FEAR THAT IT WAS A FALSE ALARM WHEN
A STEALTHY STEP WAS HEARD UPON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT AND A MOMENT
LATER A METALLIC SCRAPING AND CLINKING
THE MAN WAS TRYING TO FORCE THE
LOCK
THIS TIME HIS SKILL WAS GREATER OR HIS TOOL WAS BETTER FOR THERE
WAS A SUDDEN SNAP AND THE CREAK OF THE HINGES
THEN A MATCH WAS STRUCK
AND NEXT INSTANT THE STEADY LIGHT FROM A CANDLE FILLED THE INTERIOR OF
THE HUT
THROUGH THE GAUZE CURTAIN OUR EYES WERE ALL RIVETED UPON THE
SCENE WITHIN
THE NOCTURNAL VISITOR WAS A YOUNG MAN FRAIL AND THIN WITH A BLACK
MOUSTACHE WHICH INTENSIFIED THE DEADLY PALLOR OF HIS FACE
HE COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN MUCH ABOVE TWENTY YEARS OF AGE
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY HUMAN
BEING WHO APPEARED TO BE IN SUCH A PITIABLE FRIGHT FOR HIS TEETH WERE
VISIBLY CHATTERING AND HE WAS SHAKING IN EVERY LIMB
HE WAS DRESSED
LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN NORFOLK JACKET AND KNICKERBOCKERS WITH A CLOTH CAP
UPON HIS HEAD
WE WATCHED HIM STARING ROUND WITH FRIGHTENED EYES
THEN
HE LAID THE CANDLE END UPON THE TABLE AND DISAPPEARED FROM OUR VIEW INTO
ONE OF THE CORNERS
HE RETURNED WITH A LARGE BOOK ONE OF THE LOGBOOKS
WHICH FORMED A LINE UPON THE SHELVES
LEANING ON THE TABLE HE RAPIDLY
TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF THIS VOLUME UNTIL HE CAME TO THE ENTRY WHICH
HE SOUGHT
THEN WITH AN ANGRY GESTURE OF HIS CLENCHED HAND HE CLOSED
THE BOOK REPLACED IT IN THE CORNER AND PUT OUT THE LIGHT
HE HAD
HARDLY TURNED TO LEAVE THE HUT WHEN HOPKIN'S HAND WAS ON THE FELLOW'S
COLLAR AND I HEARD HIS LOUD GASP OF TERROR AS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE
WAS TAKEN
THE CANDLE WAS RELIT AND THERE WAS OUR WRETCHED CAPTIVE
SHIVERING AND COWERING IN THE GRASP OF THE DETECTIVE
HE SANK DOWN UPON
THE SEA CHEST AND LOOKED HELPLESSLY FROM ONE OF US TO THE OTHER
NOW MY FINE FELLOW SAID STANLEY HOPKINS WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DO
YOU WANT HERE
THE MAN PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND FACED US WITH AN EFFORT AT
SELF COMPOSURE
YOU ARE DETECTIVES I SUPPOSE SAID HE
YOU IMAGINE I AM CONNECTED
WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN PETER CAREY
I ASSURE YOU THAT I AM INNOCENT
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT SAID HOPKINS
FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS YOUR NAME
IT IS JOHN HOPLEY NELIGAN
I SAW HOLMES AND HOPKINS EXCHANGE A QUICK GLANCE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
CAN I SPEAK CONFIDENTIALLY
NO CERTAINLY NOT
WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU
IF YOU HAVE NO ANSWER IT MAY GO BADLY WITH YOU AT THE TRIAL
THE YOUNG MAN WINCED
WELL I WILL TELL YOU HE SAID
WHY SHOULD I NOT AND YET I HATE TO
THINK OF THIS OLD SCANDAL GAINING A NEW LEASE OF LIFE
DID YOU EVER HEAR
OF DAWSON AND NELIGAN
I COULD SEE FROM HOPKINS'S FACE THAT HE NEVER HAD BUT HOLMES WAS
KEENLY INTERESTED
YOU MEAN THE WEST COUNTRY BANKERS SAID HE
THEY FAILED FOR A
MILLION RUINED HALF THE COUNTY FAMILIES OF CORNWALL AND NELIGAN
DISAPPEARED
EXACTLY
NELIGAN WAS MY FATHER
AT LAST WE WERE GETTING SOMETHING POSITIVE AND YET IT SEEMED A LONG GAP
BETWEEN AN ABSCONDING BANKER AND CAPTAIN PETER CAREY PINNED AGAINST THE
WALL WITH ONE OF HIS OWN HARPOONS
WE ALL LISTENED INTENTLY TO THE YOUNG
MAN'S WORDS
IT WAS MY FATHER WHO WAS REALLY CONCERNED
DAWSON HAD RETIRED
I WAS
ONLY TEN YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME BUT I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO FEEL THE
SHAME AND HORROR OF IT ALL
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SAID THAT MY FATHER STOLE
ALL THE SECURITIES AND FLED
IT IS NOT TRUE
IT WAS HIS BELIEF THAT IF
HE WERE GIVEN TIME IN WHICH TO REALIZE THEM ALL WOULD BE WELL AND EVERY
CREDITOR PAID IN FULL
HE STARTED IN HIS LITTLE YACHT FOR NORWAY JUST
BEFORE THE WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR HIS ARREST
I CAN REMEMBER THAT LAST
NIGHT WHEN HE BADE FAREWELL TO MY MOTHER
HE LEFT US A LIST OF THE
SECURITIES HE WAS TAKING AND HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD COME BACK WITH HIS
HONOUR CLEARED AND THAT NONE WHO HAD TRUSTED HIM WOULD SUFFER
WELL
NO WORD WAS EVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN
BOTH THE YACHT AND HE VANISHED
UTTERLY
WE BELIEVED MY MOTHER AND I THAT HE AND IT WITH THE
SECURITIES THAT HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIM WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
WE
HAD A FAITHFUL FRIEND HOWEVER WHO IS A BUSINESS MAN AND IT WAS HE WHO
DISCOVERED SOME TIME AGO THAT SOME OF THE SECURITIES WHICH MY FATHER
HAD WITH HIM HAD REAPPEARED ON THE LONDON MARKET
YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR
AMAZEMENT
I SPENT MONTHS IN TRYING TO TRACE THEM AND AT LAST AFTER
MANY DOUBTINGS AND DIFFICULTIES I DISCOVERED THAT THE ORIGINAL SELLER
HAD BEEN CAPTAIN PETER CAREY THE OWNER OF THIS HUT
NATURALLY I MADE SOME INQUIRIES ABOUT THE MAN
I FOUND THAT HE HAD
BEEN IN COMMAND OF A WHALER WHICH WAS DUE TO RETURN FROM THE ARCTIC SEAS
AT THE VERY TIME WHEN MY FATHER WAS CROSSING TO NORWAY
THE AUTUMN OF
THAT YEAR WAS A STORMY ONE AND THERE WAS A LONG SUCCESSION OF SOUTHERLY
GALES
MY FATHER'S YACHT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN BLOWN TO THE NORTH AND
THERE MET BY CAPTAIN PETER CAREY'S SHIP
IF THAT WERE SO WHAT HAD
BECOME OF MY FATHER IN ANY CASE IF I COULD PROVE FROM PETER CAREY'S
EVIDENCE HOW THESE SECURITIES CAME ON THE MARKET IT WOULD BE A PROOF
THAT MY FATHER HAD NOT SOLD THEM AND THAT HE HAD NO VIEW TO PERSONAL
PROFIT WHEN HE TOOK THEM
I CAME DOWN TO SUSSEX WITH THE INTENTION OF SEEING THE CAPTAIN BUT
IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT HIS TERRIBLE DEATH OCCURRED
I READ AT THE
INQUEST A DESCRIPTION OF HIS CABIN IN WHICH IT STATED THAT THE OLD
LOGBOOKS OF HIS VESSEL WERE PRESERVED IN IT
IT STRUCK ME THAT IF I
COULD SEE WHAT OCCURRED IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1883 ON BOARD THE SEA
UNICORN I MIGHT SETTLE THE MYSTERY OF MY FATHER'S FATE
I TRIED
LAST NIGHT TO GET AT THESE LOGBOOKS BUT WAS UNABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR
TO NIGHT I TRIED AGAIN AND SUCCEEDED BUT I FIND THAT THE PAGES WHICH
DEAL WITH THAT MONTH HAVE BEEN TORN FROM THE BOOK
IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT
I FOUND MYSELF A PRISONER IN YOUR HANDS
IS THAT ALL ASKED HOPKINS
YES THAT IS ALL HIS EYES SHIFTED AS HE SAID IT
YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO TELL US
HE HESITATED
NO THERE IS NOTHING
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HERE BEFORE LAST NIGHT
NO
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT CRIED HOPKINS AS HE HELD UP THE
DAMNING NOTEBOOK WITH THE INITIALS OF OUR PRISONER ON THE FIRST LEAF
AND THE BLOOD STAIN ON THE COVER
THE WRETCHED MAN COLLAPSED
HE SANK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS AND TREMBLED
ALL OVER
WHERE DID YOU GET IT HE GROANED
I DID NOT KNOW
I THOUGHT I HAD
LOST IT AT THE HOTEL
THAT IS ENOUGH SAID HOPKINS STERNLY
WHATEVER ELSE YOU HAVE TO
SAY YOU MUST SAY IN COURT
YOU WILL WALK DOWN WITH ME NOW TO THE
POLICE STATION
WELL MR
HOLMES I AM VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AND TO
YOUR FRIEND FOR COMING DOWN TO HELP ME
AS IT TURNS OUT YOUR PRESENCE
WAS UNNECESSARY AND I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE CASE TO THIS SUCCESSFUL
ISSUE WITHOUT YOU BUT NONE THE LESS I AM GRATEFUL
ROOMS HAVE BEEN
RESERVED FOR YOU AT THE BRAMBLETYE HOTEL SO WE CAN ALL WALK DOWN TO THE
VILLAGE TOGETHER
WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ASKED HOLMES AS WE TRAVELLED
BACK NEXT MORNING
I CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED
OH YES MY DEAR WATSON I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED
AT THE SAME
TIME STANLEY HOPKINS'S METHODS DO NOT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO ME
I AM
DISAPPOINTED IN STANLEY HOPKINS
I HAD HOPED FOR BETTER THINGS FROM HIM
ONE SHOULD ALWAYS LOOK FOR A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE AND PROVIDE AGAINST
IT
IT IS THE FIRST RULE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
WHAT THEN IS THE ALTERNATIVE
THE LINE OF INVESTIGATION WHICH I HAVE MYSELF BEEN PURSUING
IT MAY
GIVE US NOTHING
I CANNOT TELL
BUT AT LEAST I SHALL FOLLOW IT TO THE
END
SEVERAL LETTERS WERE WAITING FOR HOLMES AT BAKER STREET
HE SNATCHED
ONE OF THEM UP OPENED IT AND BURST OUT INTO A TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE OF
LAUGHTER
EXCELLENT WATSON THE ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPS
HAVE YOU TELEGRAPH
FORMS JUST WRITE A COUPLE OF MESSAGES FOR ME 'SUMNER SHIPPING
AGENT RATCLIFF HIGHWAY
SEND THREE MEN ON TO ARRIVE TEN TO MORROW
MORNING BASIL THAT'S MY NAME IN THOSE PARTS
THE OTHER IS

WIRE IF UNABLE TO COME SHERLOCK
HOLMES THERE WATSON THIS INFERNAL CASE HAS HAUNTED ME FOR TEN DAYS
I HEREBY BANISH IT COMPLETELY FROM MY PRESENCE
TO MORROW I TRUST THAT
WE SHALL HEAR THE LAST OF IT FOREVER
SHARP AT THE HOUR NAMED INSPECTOR STANLEY HOPKINS APPEARED AND WE SAT
DOWN TOGETHER TO THE EXCELLENT BREAKFAST WHICH MRS
HUDSON HAD PREPARED
THE YOUNG DETECTIVE WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AT HIS SUCCESS
YOU REALLY THINK THAT YOUR SOLUTION MUST BE CORRECT ASKED HOLMES
I COULD NOT IMAGINE A MORE COMPLETE CASE
IT DID NOT SEEM TO ME CONCLUSIVE
YOU ASTONISH ME MR
HOLMES
WHAT MORE COULD ONE ASK FOR
DOES YOUR EXPLANATION COVER EVERY POINT
UNDOUBTEDLY
I FIND THAT YOUNG NELIGAN ARRIVED AT THE BRAMBLETYE HOTEL
ON THE VERY DAY OF THE CRIME
HE CAME ON THE PRETENCE OF PLAYING GOLF
HIS ROOM WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND HE COULD GET OUT WHEN HE LIKED
THAT VERY NIGHT HE WENT DOWN TO WOODMAN'S LEE SAW PETER CAREY AT
THE HUT QUARRELLED WITH HIM AND KILLED HIM WITH THE HARPOON
THEN
HORRIFIED BY WHAT HE HAD DONE HE FLED OUT OF THE HUT DROPPING THE
NOTEBOOK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM IN ORDER TO QUESTION PETER CAREY
ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT SECURITIES
YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED THAT SOME OF
THEM WERE MARKED WITH TICKS AND THE OTHERS THE GREAT MAJORITY WERE
NOT
THOSE WHICH ARE TICKED HAVE BEEN TRACED ON THE LONDON MARKET BUT
THE OTHERS PRESUMABLY WERE STILL IN THE POSSESSION OF CAREY AND YOUNG
NELIGAN ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT WAS ANXIOUS TO RECOVER THEM IN
ORDER TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY HIS FATHER'S CREDITORS
AFTER HIS FLIGHT
HE DID NOT DARE TO APPROACH THE HUT AGAIN FOR SOME TIME BUT AT LAST
HE FORCED HIMSELF TO DO SO IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION WHICH HE
NEEDED
SURELY THAT IS ALL SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS
HOLMES SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD
IT SEEMS TO ME TO HAVE ONLY ONE
DRAWBACK HOPKINS AND THAT IS THAT IT IS INTRINSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
HAVE
YOU TRIED TO DRIVE A HARPOON THROUGH A BODY NO TUT TUT MY DEAR SIR
YOU MUST REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THESE DETAILS
MY FRIEND WATSON COULD
TELL YOU THAT I SPENT A WHOLE MORNING IN THAT EXERCISE
IT IS NO EASY
MATTER AND REQUIRES A STRONG AND PRACTISED ARM
BUT THIS BLOW WAS
DELIVERED WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT THE HEAD OF THE WEAPON SANK DEEP
INTO THE WALL
DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS ANAEMIC YOUTH WAS CAPABLE OF SO
FRIGHTFUL AN ASSAULT IS HE THE MAN WHO HOBNOBBED IN RUM AND WATER WITH
BLACK PETER IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT WAS IT HIS PROFILE THAT WAS SEEN
ON THE BLIND TWO NIGHTS BEFORE NO NO HOPKINS IT IS ANOTHER AND MORE
FORMIDABLE PERSON FOR WHOM WE MUST SEEK
THE DETECTIVE'S FACE HAD GROWN LONGER AND LONGER DURING HOLMES'S SPEECH
HIS HOPES AND HIS AMBITIONS WERE ALL CRUMBLING ABOUT HIM
BUT HE WOULD
NOT ABANDON HIS POSITION WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT NELIGAN WAS PRESENT THAT NIGHT MR
HOLMES
THE
BOOK WILL PROVE THAT
I FANCY THAT I HAVE EVIDENCE ENOUGH TO SATISFY A
JURY EVEN IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PICK A HOLE IN IT
BESIDES MR
HOLMES
I HAVE LAID MY HAND UPON MY MAN
AS TO THIS TERRIBLE PERSON OF YOURS
WHERE IS HE
I RATHER FANCY THAT HE IS ON THE STAIR SAID HOLMES SERENELY
I
THINK WATSON THAT YOU WOULD DO WELL TO PUT THAT REVOLVER WHERE YOU CAN
REACH IT HE ROSE AND LAID A WRITTEN PAPER UPON A SIDE TABLE
NOW WE
ARE READY SAID HE
THERE HAD BEEN SOME TALKING IN GRUFF VOICES OUTSIDE AND NOW MRS
HUDSON
OPENED THE DOOR TO SAY THAT THERE WERE THREE MEN INQUIRING FOR CAPTAIN
BASIL
SHOW THEM IN ONE BY ONE SAID HOLMES
THE FIRST WHO ENTERED WAS A LITTLE RIBSTON PIPPIN OF A MAN WITH RUDDY
CHEEKS AND FLUFFY WHITE SIDE WHISKERS
HOLMES HAD DRAWN A LETTER FROM
HIS POCKET
WHAT NAME HE ASKED
JAMES LANCASTER
I AM SORRY LANCASTER BUT THE BERTH IS FULL
HERE IS HALF A SOVEREIGN
FOR YOUR TROUBLE
JUST STEP INTO THIS ROOM AND WAIT THERE FOR A FEW
MINUTES
THE SECOND MAN WAS A LONG DRIED UP CREATURE WITH LANK HAIR AND SALLOW
CHEEKS
HIS NAME WAS HUGH PATTINS
HE ALSO RECEIVED HIS DISMISSAL HIS
HALF SOVEREIGN AND THE ORDER TO WAIT
THE THIRD APPLICANT WAS A MAN OF REMARKABLE APPEARANCE
A FIERCE
BULL DOG FACE WAS FRAMED IN A TANGLE OF HAIR AND BEARD AND TWO BOLD
DARK EYES GLEAMED BEHIND THE COVER OF THICK TUFTED OVERHUNG EYEBROWS
HE SALUTED AND STOOD SAILOR FASHION TURNING HIS CAP ROUND IN HIS HANDS
YOUR NAME ASKED HOLMES
PATRICK CAIRNS
HARPOONER
YES SIR
TWENTY SIX VOYAGES
DUNDEE I SUPPOSE
YES SIR
AND READY TO START WITH AN EXPLORING SHIP
YES SIR
WHAT WAGES
EIGHT POUNDS A MONTH
COULD YOU START AT ONCE
AS SOON AS I GET MY KIT
HAVE YOU YOUR PAPERS
YES SIR HE TOOK A SHEAF OF WORN AND GREASY FORMS FROM HIS POCKET
HOLMES GLANCED OVER THEM AND RETURNED THEM
YOU ARE JUST THE MAN I WANT SAID HE
HERE'S THE AGREEMENT ON THE
SIDE TABLE
IF YOU SIGN IT THE WHOLE MATTER WILL BE SETTLED
THE SEAMAN LURCHED ACROSS THE ROOM AND TOOK UP THE PEN
SHALL I SIGN HERE HE ASKED STOOPING OVER THE TABLE
HOLMES LEANED OVER HIS SHOULDER AND PASSED BOTH HANDS OVER HIS NECK
THIS WILL DO SAID HE
I HEARD A CLICK OF STEEL AND A BELLOW LIKE AN ENRAGED BULL
THE NEXT
INSTANT HOLMES AND THE SEAMAN WERE ROLLING ON THE GROUND TOGETHER
HE
WAS A MAN OF SUCH GIGANTIC STRENGTH THAT EVEN WITH THE HANDCUFFS
WHICH HOLMES HAD SO DEFTLY FASTENED UPON HIS WRISTS HE WOULD HAVE
VERY QUICKLY OVERPOWERED MY FRIEND HAD HOPKINS AND I NOT RUSHED TO
HIS RESCUE
ONLY WHEN I PRESSED THE COLD MUZZLE OF THE REVOLVER TO HIS
TEMPLE DID HE AT LAST UNDERSTAND THAT RESISTANCE WAS VAIN
WE LASHED HIS
ANKLES WITH CORD AND ROSE BREATHLESS FROM THE STRUGGLE
I MUST REALLY APOLOGIZE HOPKINS SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
I FEAR THAT
THE SCRAMBLED EGGS ARE COLD
HOWEVER YOU WILL ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR
BREAKFAST ALL THE BETTER WILL YOU NOT FOR THE THOUGHT THAT YOU HAVE
BROUGHT YOUR CASE TO A TRIUMPHANT CONCLUSION
STANLEY HOPKINS WAS SPEECHLESS WITH AMAZEMENT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY MR
HOLMES HE BLURTED OUT AT LAST WITH A
VERY RED FACE
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING A FOOL OF
MYSELF FROM THE BEGINNING
I UNDERSTAND NOW WHAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
FORGOTTEN THAT I AM THE PUPIL AND YOU ARE THE MASTER
EVEN NOW I
SEE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT OR WHAT IT
SIGNIFIES
WELL WELL SAID HOLMES GOOD HUMOUREDLY
WE ALL LEARN BY EXPERIENCE
AND YOUR LESSON THIS TIME IS THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE
ALTERNATIVE
YOU WERE SO ABSORBED IN YOUNG NELIGAN THAT YOU COULD NOT
SPARE A THOUGHT TO PATRICK CAIRNS THE TRUE MURDERER OF PETER CAREY
THE HOARSE VOICE OF THE SEAMAN BROKE IN ON OUR CONVERSATION
SEE HERE MISTER SAID HE I MAKE NO COMPLAINT OF BEING MAN HANDLED
IN THIS FASHION BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU CALL THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES
YOU SAY I MURDERED PETER CAREY I SAY I KILLED PETER CAREY AND THERE'S
ALL THE DIFFERENCE
MAYBE YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAY
MAYBE YOU THINK
I AM JUST SLINGING YOU A YARN
NOT AT ALL SAID HOLMES
LET US HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
IT'S SOON TOLD AND BY THE LORD EVERY WORD OF IT IS TRUTH
I KNEW
BLACK PETER AND WHEN HE PULLED OUT HIS KNIFE I WHIPPED A HARPOON
THROUGH HIM SHARP FOR I KNEW THAT IT WAS HIM OR ME
THAT'S HOW HE DIED
YOU CAN CALL IT MURDER
ANYHOW I'D AS SOON DIE WITH A ROPE ROUND MY
NECK AS WITH BLACK PETER'S KNIFE IN MY HEART
HOW CAME YOU THERE ASKED HOLMES
I'LL TELL IT YOU FROM THE BEGINNING
JUST SIT ME UP A LITTLE SO AS
I CAN SPEAK EASY
IT WAS IN '83 THAT IT HAPPENED AUGUST OF THAT YEAR
PETER CAREY WAS MASTER OF THE SEA UNICORN AND I WAS SPARE HARPOONER
WE
WERE COMING OUT OF THE ICE PACK ON OUR WAY HOME WITH HEAD WINDS AND A
WEEK'S SOUTHERLY GALE WHEN WE PICKED UP A LITTLE CRAFT THAT HAD BEEN
BLOWN NORTH
THERE WAS ONE MAN ON HER A LANDSMAN
THE CREW HAD THOUGHT
SHE WOULD FOUNDER AND HAD MADE FOR THE NORWEGIAN COAST IN THE DINGHY
I
GUESS THEY WERE ALL DROWNED
WELL WE TOOK HIM ON BOARD THIS MAN AND
HE AND THE SKIPPER HAD SOME LONG TALKS IN THE CABIN
ALL THE BAGGAGE WE
TOOK OFF WITH HIM WAS ONE TIN BOX
SO FAR AS I KNOW THE MAN'S NAME WAS
NEVER MENTIONED AND ON THE SECOND NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED AS IF HE HAD
NEVER BEEN
IT WAS GIVEN OUT THAT HE HAD EITHER THROWN HIMSELF OVERBOARD
OR FALLEN OVERBOARD IN THE HEAVY WEATHER THAT WE WERE HAVING
ONLY ONE
MAN KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND THAT WAS ME FOR WITH MY OWN
EYES I SAW THE SKIPPER TIP UP HIS HEELS AND PUT HIM OVER THE RAIL
IN THE MIDDLE WATCH OF A DARK NIGHT TWO DAYS BEFORE WE SIGHTED THE
SHETLAND LIGHTS
WELL I KEPT MY KNOWLEDGE TO MYSELF AND WAITED TO SEE
WHAT WOULD COME OF IT
WHEN WE GOT BACK TO SCOTLAND IT WAS EASILY HUSHED
UP AND NOBODY ASKED ANY QUESTIONS
A STRANGER DIED BY ACCIDENT AND IT
WAS NOBODY'S BUSINESS TO INQUIRE
SHORTLY AFTER PETER CAREY GAVE UP THE
SEA AND IT WAS LONG YEARS BEFORE I COULD FIND WHERE HE WAS
I GUESSED
THAT HE HAD DONE THE DEED FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT WAS IN THAT TIN BOX AND
THAT HE COULD AFFORD NOW TO PAY ME WELL FOR KEEPING MY MOUTH SHUT
I
FOUND OUT WHERE HE WAS THROUGH A SAILOR MAN THAT HAD MET HIM IN LONDON
AND DOWN I WENT TO SQUEEZE HIM
THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS REASONABLE
ENOUGH AND WAS READY TO GIVE ME WHAT WOULD MAKE ME FREE OF THE SEA FOR
LIFE
WE WERE TO FIX IT ALL TWO NIGHTS LATER
WHEN I CAME I FOUND HIM
THREE PARTS DRUNK AND IN A VILE TEMPER
WE SAT DOWN AND WE DRANK AND WE
YARNED ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT THE MORE HE DRANK THE LESS I LIKED THE LOOK
ON HIS FACE
I SPOTTED THAT HARPOON UPON THE WALL AND I THOUGHT I MIGHT
NEED IT BEFORE I WAS THROUGH
THEN AT LAST HE BROKE OUT AT ME SPITTING
AND CURSING WITH MURDER IN HIS EYES AND A GREAT CLASP KNIFE IN HIS
HAND
HE HAD NOT TIME TO GET IT FROM THE SHEATH BEFORE I HAD THE HARPOON
THROUGH HIM
HEAVENS WHAT A YELL HE GAVE AND HIS FACE GETS BETWEEN ME
AND MY SLEEP
I STOOD THERE WITH HIS BLOOD SPLASHING ROUND ME AND I
WAITED FOR A BIT BUT ALL WAS QUIET SO I TOOK HEART ONCE MORE
I LOOKED
ROUND AND THERE WAS THE TIN BOX ON THE SHELF
I HAD AS MUCH RIGHT TO
IT AS PETER CAREY ANYHOW SO I TOOK IT WITH ME AND LEFT THE HUT
LIKE A
FOOL I LEFT MY BACCY POUCH UPON THE TABLE
NOW I'LL TELL YOU THE QUEEREST PART OF THE WHOLE STORY
I HAD HARDLY
GOT OUTSIDE THE HUT WHEN I HEARD SOMEONE COMING AND I HID AMONG THE
BUSHES
A MAN CAME SLINKING ALONG WENT INTO THE HUT GAVE A CRY AS IF
HE HAD SEEN A GHOST AND LEGGED IT AS HARD AS HE COULD RUN UNTIL HE WAS
OUT OF SIGHT
WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE WANTED IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL
FOR MY PART I WALKED TEN MILES GOT A TRAIN AT TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND SO
REACHED LONDON AND NO ONE THE WISER
WELL WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE THE BOX I FOUND THERE WAS NO MONEY IN IT
AND NOTHING BUT PAPERS THAT I WOULD NOT DARE TO SELL
I HAD LOST MY HOLD
ON BLACK PETER AND WAS STRANDED IN LONDON WITHOUT A SHILLING
THERE WAS
ONLY MY TRADE LEFT
I SAW THESE ADVERTISEMENTS ABOUT HARPOONERS AND
HIGH WAGES SO I WENT TO THE SHIPPING AGENTS AND THEY SENT ME HERE
THAT'S ALL I KNOW AND I SAY AGAIN THAT IF I KILLED BLACK PETER THE LAW
SHOULD GIVE ME THANKS FOR I SAVED THEM THE PRICE OF A HEMPEN ROPE
A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT SAID HOLMES RISING AND LIGHTING HIS PIPE
I
THINK HOPKINS THAT YOU SHOULD LOSE NO TIME IN CONVEYING YOUR PRISONER
TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
THIS ROOM IS NOT WELL ADAPTED FOR A CELL AND MR
PATRICK CAIRNS OCCUPIES TOO LARGE A PROPORTION OF OUR CARPET
MR
HOLMES SAID HOPKINS I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE
EVEN NOW I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ATTAINED THIS RESULT
SIMPLY BY HAVING THE GOOD FORTUNE TO GET THE RIGHT CLUE FROM THE
BEGINNING
IT IS VERY POSSIBLE IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS NOTEBOOK
IT MIGHT HAVE LED AWAY MY THOUGHTS AS IT DID YOURS
BUT ALL I HEARD
POINTED IN THE ONE DIRECTION
THE AMAZING STRENGTH THE SKILL IN THE USE
OF THE HARPOON THE RUM AND WATER THE SEALSKIN TOBACCO POUCH WITH THE
COARSE TOBACCO ALL THESE POINTED TO A SEAMAN AND ONE WHO HAD BEEN A
WHALER
I WAS CONVINCED THAT THE INITIALS 'P C UPON THE POUCH WERE A
COINCIDENCE AND NOT THOSE OF PETER CAREY SINCE HE SELDOM SMOKED AND
NO PIPE WAS FOUND IN HIS CABIN
YOU REMEMBER THAT I ASKED WHETHER WHISKY
AND BRANDY WERE IN THE CABIN
YOU SAID THEY WERE
HOW MANY LANDSMEN ARE
THERE WHO WOULD DRINK RUM WHEN THEY COULD GET THESE OTHER SPIRITS YES
I WAS CERTAIN IT WAS A SEAMAN
AND HOW DID YOU FIND HIM
MY DEAR SIR THE PROBLEM HAD BECOME A VERY SIMPLE ONE
IF IT WERE
A SEAMAN IT COULD ONLY BE A SEAMAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH HIM ON THE SEA
UNICORN
SO FAR AS I COULD LEARN HE HAD SAILED IN NO OTHER SHIP
I
SPENT THREE DAYS IN WIRING TO DUNDEE AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME I HAD
ASCERTAINED THE NAMES OF THE CREW OF THE SEA UNICORN IN 1883
WHEN I
FOUND PATRICK CAIRNS AMONG THE HARPOONERS MY RESEARCH WAS NEARING ITS
END
I ARGUED THAT THE MAN WAS PROBABLY IN LONDON AND THAT HE WOULD
DESIRE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR A TIME
I THEREFORE SPENT SOME DAYS IN
THE EAST END DEVISED AN ARCTIC EXPEDITION PUT FORTH TEMPTING TERMS FOR
HARPOONERS WHO WOULD SERVE UNDER CAPTAIN BASIL AND BEHOLD THE RESULT
WONDERFUL CRIED HOPKINS
WONDERFUL
YOU MUST OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF YOUNG NELIGAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID
HOLMES
I CONFESS THAT I THINK YOU OWE HIM SOME APOLOGY
THE TIN BOX
MUST BE RETURNED TO HIM BUT OF COURSE THE SECURITIES WHICH PETER
CAREY HAS SOLD ARE LOST FOREVER
THERE'S THE CAB HOPKINS AND YOU CAN
REMOVE YOUR MAN
IF YOU WANT ME FOR THE TRIAL MY ADDRESS AND THAT OF
WATSON WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN NORWAY I'LL SEND PARTICULARS LATER
THE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON
IT IS YEARS SINCE THE INCIDENTS OF WHICH I SPEAK TOOK PLACE AND YET IT
IS WITH DIFFIDENCE THAT I ALLUDE TO THEM
FOR A LONG TIME EVEN WITH THE
UTMOST DISCRETION AND RETICENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE
THE FACTS PUBLIC BUT NOW THE PRINCIPAL PERSON CONCERNED IS BEYOND THE
REACH OF HUMAN LAW AND WITH DUE SUPPRESSION THE STORY MAY BE TOLD
IN SUCH FASHION AS TO INJURE NO ONE
IT RECORDS AN ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE
EXPERIENCE IN THE CAREER BOTH OF MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND OF MYSELF
THE
READER WILL EXCUSE ME IF I CONCEAL THE DATE OR ANY OTHER FACT BY WHICH
HE MIGHT TRACE THE ACTUAL OCCURRENCE
WE HAD BEEN OUT FOR ONE OF OUR EVENING RAMBLES HOLMES AND I AND HAD
RETURNED ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK ON A COLD FROSTY WINTER'S EVENING
AS HOLMES
TURNED UP THE LAMP THE LIGHT FELL UPON A CARD ON THE TABLE
HE GLANCED
AT IT AND THEN WITH AN EJACULATION OF DISGUST THREW IT ON THE FLOOR
I PICKED IT UP AND READ
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON APPLEDORE TOWERS HAMPSTEAD
AGENT
WHO IS HE I ASKED
THE WORST MAN IN LONDON HOLMES ANSWERED AS HE SAT DOWN AND STRETCHED
HIS LEGS BEFORE THE FIRE
IS ANYTHING ON THE BACK OF THE CARD
I TURNED IT OVER
WILL CALL AT 6 30 C A M I READ
HUM HE'S ABOUT DUE
DO YOU FEEL A CREEPING SHRINKING SENSATION
WATSON WHEN YOU STAND BEFORE THE SERPENTS IN THE ZOO AND SEE THE
SLITHERY GLIDING VENOMOUS CREATURES WITH THEIR DEADLY EYES AND
WICKED FLATTENED FACES WELL THAT'S HOW MILVERTON IMPRESSES ME
I'VE
HAD TO DO WITH FIFTY MURDERERS IN MY CAREER BUT THE WORST OF THEM NEVER
GAVE ME THE REPULSION WHICH I HAVE FOR THIS FELLOW
AND YET I CAN'T GET
OUT OF DOING BUSINESS WITH HIM INDEED HE IS HERE AT MY INVITATION
BUT WHO IS HE
I'LL TELL YOU WATSON
HE IS THE KING OF ALL THE BLACKMAILERS
HEAVEN
HELP THE MAN AND STILL MORE THE WOMAN WHOSE SECRET AND REPUTATION COME
INTO THE POWER OF MILVERTON WITH A SMILING FACE AND A HEART OF MARBLE
HE WILL SQUEEZE AND SQUEEZE UNTIL HE HAS DRAINED THEM DRY
THE FELLOW IS
A GENIUS IN HIS WAY AND WOULD HAVE MADE HIS MARK IN SOME MORE SAVOURY
TRADE
HIS METHOD IS AS FOLLOWS HE ALLOWS IT TO BE KNOWN THAT HE IS
PREPARED TO PAY VERY HIGH SUMS FOR LETTERS WHICH COMPROMISE PEOPLE OF
WEALTH AND POSITION
HE RECEIVES THESE WARES NOT ONLY FROM TREACHEROUS
VALETS OR MAIDS BUT FREQUENTLY FROM GENTEEL RUFFIANS WHO HAVE GAINED
THE CONFIDENCE AND AFFECTION OF TRUSTING WOMEN
HE DEALS WITH NO NIGGARD
HAND
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT HE PAID SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS TO A FOOTMAN
FOR A NOTE TWO LINES IN LENGTH AND THAT THE RUIN OF A NOBLE FAMILY WAS
THE RESULT
EVERYTHING WHICH IS IN THE MARKET GOES TO MILVERTON AND
THERE ARE HUNDREDS IN THIS GREAT CITY WHO TURN WHITE AT HIS NAME
NO
ONE KNOWS WHERE HIS GRIP MAY FALL FOR HE IS FAR TOO RICH AND FAR TOO
CUNNING TO WORK FROM HAND TO MOUTH
HE WILL HOLD A CARD BACK FOR YEARS
IN ORDER TO PLAY IT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE STAKE IS BEST WORTH WINNING
I HAVE SAID THAT HE IS THE WORST MAN IN LONDON AND I WOULD ASK YOU HOW
COULD ONE COMPARE THE RUFFIAN WHO IN HOT BLOOD BLUDGEONS HIS MATE
WITH THIS MAN WHO METHODICALLY AND AT HIS LEISURE TORTURES THE SOUL AND
WRINGS THE NERVES IN ORDER TO ADD TO HIS ALREADY SWOLLEN MONEY BAGS
I HAD SELDOM HEARD MY FRIEND SPEAK WITH SUCH INTENSITY OF FEELING
BUT SURELY SAID I THE FELLOW MUST BE WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE LAW
TECHNICALLY NO DOUBT BUT PRACTICALLY NOT
WHAT WOULD IT PROFIT A
WOMAN FOR EXAMPLE TO GET HIM A FEW MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT IF HER OWN
RUIN MUST IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW HIS VICTIMS DARE NOT HIT BACK
IF EVER HE
BLACKMAILED AN INNOCENT PERSON THEN INDEED WE SHOULD HAVE HIM BUT HE
IS AS CUNNING AS THE EVIL ONE
NO NO WE MUST FIND OTHER WAYS TO FIGHT
HIM
AND WHY IS HE HERE
BECAUSE AN ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT HAS PLACED HER PITEOUS CASE IN MY HANDS
IT IS THE LADY EVA BLACKWELL THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DEBUTANTE OF LAST
SEASON
SHE IS TO BE MARRIED IN A FORTNIGHT TO THE EARL OF DOVERCOURT
THIS FIEND HAS SEVERAL IMPRUDENT LETTERS IMPRUDENT WATSON NOTHING
WORSE WHICH WERE WRITTEN TO AN IMPECUNIOUS YOUNG SQUIRE IN THE COUNTRY
THEY WOULD SUFFICE TO BREAK OFF THE MATCH
MILVERTON WILL SEND THE
LETTERS TO THE EARL UNLESS A LARGE SUM OF MONEY IS PAID HIM
I HAVE BEEN
COMMISSIONED TO MEET HIM AND TO MAKE THE BEST TERMS I CAN
AT THAT INSTANT THERE WAS A CLATTER AND A RATTLE IN THE STREET BELOW
LOOKING DOWN I SAW A STATELY CARRIAGE AND PAIR THE BRILLIANT LAMPS
GLEAMING ON THE GLOSSY HAUNCHES OF THE NOBLE CHESTNUTS
A FOOTMAN
OPENED THE DOOR AND A SMALL STOUT MAN IN A SHAGGY ASTRAKHAN OVERCOAT
DESCENDED
A MINUTE LATER HE WAS IN THE ROOM
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON WAS A MAN OF FIFTY WITH A LARGE
INTELLECTUAL HEAD A ROUND PLUMP HAIRLESS FACE A PERPETUAL FROZEN
SMILE AND TWO KEEN GRAY EYES WHICH GLEAMED BRIGHTLY FROM BEHIND BROAD
GOLD RIMMED GLASSES
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF MR
PICKWICK'S BENEVOLENCE
IN HIS APPEARANCE MARRED ONLY BY THE INSINCERITY OF THE FIXED SMILE AND
BY THE HARD GLITTER OF THOSE RESTLESS AND PENETRATING EYES
HIS VOICE
WAS AS SMOOTH AND SUAVE AS HIS COUNTENANCE AS HE ADVANCED WITH A PLUMP
LITTLE HAND EXTENDED MURMURING HIS REGRET FOR HAVING MISSED US AT HIS
FIRST VISIT
HOLMES DISREGARDED THE OUTSTRETCHED HAND AND LOOKED AT HIM
WITH A FACE OF GRANITE
MILVERTON'S SMILE BROADENED HE SHRUGGED HIS
SHOULDERS REMOVED HIS OVERCOAT FOLDED IT WITH GREAT DELIBERATION OVER
THE BACK OF A CHAIR AND THEN TOOK A SEAT
THIS GENTLEMAN SAID HE WITH A WAVE IN MY DIRECTION
IS IT DISCREET
IS IT RIGHT
DR
WATSON IS MY FRIEND AND PARTNER
VERY GOOD MR
HOLMES
IT IS ONLY IN YOUR CLIENT'S INTERESTS THAT I
PROTESTED
THE MATTER IS SO VERY DELICATE
DR
WATSON HAS ALREADY HEARD OF IT
THEN WE CAN PROCEED TO BUSINESS
YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE ACTING FOR LADY
EVA
HAS SHE EMPOWERED YOU TO ACCEPT MY TERMS
WHAT ARE YOUR TERMS
SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS
AND THE ALTERNATIVE
MY DEAR SIR IT IS PAINFUL FOR ME TO DISCUSS IT BUT IF THE MONEY IS
NOT PAID ON THE 14TH THERE CERTAINLY WILL BE NO MARRIAGE ON THE 18TH
HIS INSUFFERABLE SMILE WAS MORE COMPLACENT THAN EVER
HOLMES THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE
YOU APPEAR TO ME HE SAID AT LAST TO BE TAKING MATTERS TOO MUCH FOR
GRANTED
I AM OF COURSE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONTENTS OF THESE LETTERS
MY CLIENT WILL CERTAINLY DO WHAT I MAY ADVISE
I SHALL COUNSEL HER TO
TELL HER FUTURE HUSBAND THE WHOLE STORY AND TO TRUST TO HIS GENEROSITY
MILVERTON CHUCKLED
YOU EVIDENTLY DO NOT KNOW THE EARL SAID HE
FROM THE BAFFLED LOOK UPON HOLMES'S FACE I COULD SEE CLEARLY THAT HE
DID
WHAT HARM IS THERE IN THE LETTERS HE ASKED
THEY ARE SPRIGHTLY VERY SPRIGHTLY MILVERTON ANSWERED
THE LADY
WAS A CHARMING CORRESPONDENT
BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE EARL OF
DOVERCOURT WOULD FAIL TO APPRECIATE THEM
HOWEVER SINCE YOU THINK
OTHERWISE WE WILL LET IT REST AT THAT
IT IS PURELY A MATTER OF
BUSINESS
IF YOU THINK THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF YOUR CLIENT
THAT THESE LETTERS SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF THE EARL THEN YOU
WOULD INDEED BE FOOLISH TO PAY SO LARGE A SUM OF MONEY TO REGAIN THEM
HE ROSE AND SEIZED HIS ASTRAKHAN COAT
HOLMES WAS GRAY WITH ANGER AND MORTIFICATION
WAIT A LITTLE HE SAID
YOU GO TOO FAST
WE SHOULD CERTAINLY MAKE
EVERY EFFORT TO AVOID SCANDAL IN SO DELICATE A MATTER
MILVERTON RELAPSED INTO HIS CHAIR
I WAS SURE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT HE PURRED
AT THE SAME TIME HOLMES CONTINUED LADY EVA IS NOT A WEALTHY
WOMAN
I ASSURE YOU THAT TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WOULD BE A DRAIN UPON HER
RESOURCES AND THAT THE SUM YOU NAME IS UTTERLY BEYOND HER POWER
I BEG
THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL MODERATE YOUR DEMANDS AND THAT YOU WILL RETURN
THE LETTERS AT THE PRICE I INDICATE WHICH IS I ASSURE YOU THE HIGHEST
THAT YOU CAN GET
MILVERTON'S SMILE BROADENED AND HIS EYES TWINKLED HUMOROUSLY
I AM AWARE THAT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT THE LADY'S RESOURCES
SAID HE
AT THE SAME TIME YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THE OCCASION OF A LADY'S
MARRIAGE IS A VERY SUITABLE TIME FOR HER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES TO
MAKE SOME LITTLE EFFORT UPON HER BEHALF
THEY MAY HESITATE AS TO AN
ACCEPTABLE WEDDING PRESENT
LET ME ASSURE THEM THAT THIS LITTLE BUNDLE
OF LETTERS WOULD GIVE MORE JOY THAN ALL THE CANDELABRA AND BUTTER DISHES
IN LONDON
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE SAID HOLMES
DEAR ME DEAR ME HOW UNFORTUNATE CRIED MILVERTON TAKING OUT A BULKY
POCKETBOOK
I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT LADIES ARE ILL ADVISED IN
NOT MAKING AN EFFORT
LOOK AT THIS HE HELD UP A LITTLE NOTE WITH A
COAT OF ARMS UPON THE ENVELOPE
THAT BELONGS TO WELL PERHAPS IT IS
HARDLY FAIR TO TELL THE NAME UNTIL TO MORROW MORNING
BUT AT THAT TIME
IT WILL BE IN THE HANDS OF THE LADY'S HUSBAND
AND ALL BECAUSE SHE WILL
NOT FIND A BEGGARLY SUM WHICH SHE COULD GET BY TURNING HER DIAMONDS
INTO PASTE
IT IS SUCH A PITY NOW YOU REMEMBER THE SUDDEN END OF THE
ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE HONOURABLE MISS MILES AND COLONEL DORKING ONLY
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING THERE WAS A PARAGRAPH IN THE MORNING POST
TO SAY THAT IT WAS ALL OFF
AND WHY IT IS ALMOST INCREDIBLE BUT
THE ABSURD SUM OF TWELVE HUNDRED POUNDS WOULD HAVE SETTLED THE WHOLE
QUESTION
IS IT NOT PITIFUL AND HERE I FIND YOU A MAN OF SENSE
BOGGLING ABOUT TERMS WHEN YOUR CLIENT'S FUTURE AND HONOUR ARE AT STAKE
YOU SURPRISE ME MR
HOLMES
WHAT I SAY IS TRUE HOLMES ANSWERED
THE MONEY CANNOT BE FOUND
SURELY IT IS BETTER FOR YOU TO TAKE THE SUBSTANTIAL SUM WHICH I OFFER
THAN TO RUIN THIS WOMAN'S CAREER WHICH CAN PROFIT YOU IN NO WAY
THERE YOU MAKE A MISTAKE MR
HOLMES
AN EXPOSURE WOULD PROFIT ME
INDIRECTLY TO A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT
I HAVE EIGHT OR TEN SIMILAR CASES
MATURING
IF IT WAS CIRCULATED AMONG THEM THAT I HAD MADE A SEVERE
EXAMPLE OF THE LADY EVA I SHOULD FIND ALL OF THEM MUCH MORE OPEN TO
REASON
YOU SEE MY POINT
HOLMES SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR
GET BEHIND HIM WATSON DON'T LET HIM OUT NOW SIR LET US SEE THE
CONTENTS OF THAT NOTEBOOK
MILVERTON HAD GLIDED AS QUICK AS A RAT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROOM AND STOOD
WITH HIS BACK AGAINST THE WALL
MR
HOLMES MR
HOLMES HE SAID TURNING THE FRONT OF HIS COAT AND
EXHIBITING THE BUTT OF A LARGE REVOLVER WHICH PROJECTED FROM THE INSIDE
POCKET
I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU TO DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL
THIS HAS
BEEN DONE SO OFTEN AND WHAT GOOD HAS EVER COME FROM IT I ASSURE YOU
THAT I AM ARMED TO THE TEETH AND I AM PERFECTLY PREPARED TO USE MY
WEAPONS KNOWING THAT THE LAW WILL SUPPORT ME
BESIDES YOUR SUPPOSITION
THAT I WOULD BRING THE LETTERS HERE IN A NOTEBOOK IS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN
I WOULD DO NOTHING SO FOOLISH
AND NOW GENTLEMEN I HAVE ONE OR TWO
LITTLE INTERVIEWS THIS EVENING AND IT IS A LONG DRIVE TO HAMPSTEAD
HE STEPPED FORWARD TOOK UP HIS COAT LAID HIS HAND ON HIS REVOLVER AND
TURNED TO THE DOOR
I PICKED UP A CHAIR BUT HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD AND
I LAID IT DOWN AGAIN
WITH BOW A SMILE AND A TWINKLE MILVERTON
WAS OUT OF THE ROOM AND A FEW MOMENTS AFTER WE HEARD THE SLAM OF THE
CARRIAGE DOOR AND THE RATTLE OF THE WHEELS AS HE DROVE AWAY
HOLMES SAT MOTIONLESS BY THE FIRE HIS HANDS BURIED DEEP IN HIS TROUSER
POCKETS HIS CHIN SUNK UPON HIS BREAST HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE GLOWING
EMBERS
FOR HALF AN HOUR HE WAS SILENT AND STILL
THEN WITH THE GESTURE
OF A MAN WHO HAS TAKEN HIS DECISION HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND PASSED
INTO HIS BEDROOM
A LITTLE LATER A RAKISH YOUNG WORKMAN WITH A GOATEE
BEARD AND A SWAGGER LIT HIS CLAY PIPE AT THE LAMP BEFORE DESCENDING
INTO THE STREET
I'LL BE BACK SOME TIME WATSON SAID HE AND VANISHED
INTO THE NIGHT
I UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD OPENED HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST
CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON BUT I LITTLE DREAMED THE STRANGE SHAPE WHICH
THAT CAMPAIGN WAS DESTINED TO TAKE
FOR SOME DAYS HOLMES CAME AND WENT AT ALL HOURS IN THIS ATTIRE BUT
BEYOND A REMARK THAT HIS TIME WAS SPENT AT HAMPSTEAD AND THAT IT WAS
NOT WASTED I KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HE WAS DOING
AT LAST HOWEVER ON
A WILD TEMPESTUOUS EVENING WHEN THE WIND SCREAMED AND RATTLED AGAINST
THE WINDOWS HE RETURNED FROM HIS LAST EXPEDITION AND HAVING REMOVED
HIS DISGUISE HE SAT BEFORE THE FIRE AND LAUGHED HEARTILY IN HIS SILENT
INWARD FASHION
YOU WOULD NOT CALL ME A MARRYING MAN WATSON
NO INDEED
YOU'LL BE INTERESTED TO HEAR THAT I'M ENGAGED
MY DEAR FELLOW I CONGRAT
TO MILVERTON'S HOUSEMAID
GOOD HEAVENS HOLMES
I WANTED INFORMATION WATSON
SURELY YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR
IT WAS A MOST NECESSARY STEP
I AM A PLUMBER WITH A RISING BUSINESS
ESCOTT BY NAME
I HAVE WALKED OUT WITH HER EACH EVENING AND I HAVE
TALKED WITH HER
GOOD HEAVENS THOSE TALKS HOWEVER I HAVE GOT ALL I
WANTED
I KNOW MILVERTON'S HOUSE AS I KNOW THE PALM OF MY HAND
BUT THE GIRL HOLMES
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
YOU CAN'T HELP IT MY DEAR WATSON
YOU MUST PLAY YOUR CARDS AS BEST YOU
CAN WHEN SUCH A STAKE IS ON THE TABLE
HOWEVER I REJOICE TO SAY THAT
I HAVE A HATED RIVAL WHO WILL CERTAINLY CUT ME OUT THE INSTANT THAT MY
BACK IS TURNED
WHAT A SPLENDID NIGHT IT IS
YOU LIKE THIS WEATHER
IT SUITS MY PURPOSE
WATSON I MEAN TO BURGLE MILVERTON'S HOUSE
TO NIGHT
I HAD A CATCHING OF THE BREATH AND MY SKIN WENT COLD AT THE WORDS
WHICH WERE SLOWLY UTTERED IN A TONE OF CONCENTRATED RESOLUTION
AS A
FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE NIGHT SHOWS UP IN AN INSTANT EVERY DETAIL OF
A WILD LANDSCAPE SO AT ONE GLANCE I SEEMED TO SEE EVERY POSSIBLE RESULT
OF SUCH AN ACTION THE DETECTION THE CAPTURE THE HONOURED CAREER
ENDING IN IRREPARABLE FAILURE AND DISGRACE MY FRIEND HIMSELF LYING AT
THE MERCY OF THE ODIOUS MILVERTON
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE HOLMES THINK WHAT YOU ARE DOING I CRIED
MY DEAR FELLOW I HAVE GIVEN IT EVERY CONSIDERATION
I AM NEVER
PRECIPITATE IN MY ACTIONS NOR WOULD I ADOPT SO ENERGETIC AND INDEED
SO DANGEROUS A COURSE IF ANY OTHER WERE POSSIBLE
LET US LOOK AT THE
MATTER CLEARLY AND FAIRLY
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WILL ADMIT THAT THE ACTION
IS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE THOUGH TECHNICALLY CRIMINAL
TO BURGLE HIS HOUSE
IS NO MORE THAN TO FORCIBLY TAKE HIS POCKETBOOK AN ACTION IN WHICH YOU
WERE PREPARED TO AID ME
I TURNED IT OVER IN MY MIND
YES I SAID IT IS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE SO LONG AS OUR OBJECT IS TO
TAKE NO ARTICLES SAVE THOSE WHICH ARE USED FOR AN ILLEGAL PURPOSE
EXACTLY
SINCE IT IS MORALLY JUSTIFIABLE I HAVE ONLY TO CONSIDER THE
QUESTION OF PERSONAL RISK
SURELY A GENTLEMAN SHOULD NOT LAY MUCH STRESS
UPON THIS WHEN A LADY IS IN MOST DESPERATE NEED OF HIS HELP
YOU WILL BE IN SUCH A FALSE POSITION
WELL THAT IS PART OF THE RISK
THERE IS NO OTHER POSSIBLE WAY OF
REGAINING THESE LETTERS
THE UNFORTUNATE LADY HAS NOT THE MONEY AND
THERE ARE NONE OF HER PEOPLE IN WHOM SHE COULD CONFIDE
TO MORROW IS
THE LAST DAY OF GRACE AND UNLESS WE CAN GET THE LETTERS TO NIGHT THIS
VILLAIN WILL BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AND WILL BRING ABOUT HER RUIN
I
MUST THEREFORE ABANDON MY CLIENT TO HER FATE OR I MUST PLAY THIS
LAST CARD
BETWEEN OURSELVES WATSON IT'S A SPORTING DUEL BETWEEN
THIS FELLOW MILVERTON AND ME
HE HAD AS YOU SAW THE BEST OF THE FIRST
EXCHANGES BUT MY SELF RESPECT AND MY REPUTATION ARE CONCERNED TO FIGHT
IT TO A FINISH
WELL I DON'T LIKE IT BUT I SUPPOSE IT MUST BE SAID I
WHEN DO WE
START
YOU ARE NOT COMING
THEN YOU ARE NOT GOING SAID I
I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOUR AND
I NEVER BROKE IT IN MY LIFE THAT I WILL TAKE A CAB STRAIGHT TO THE
POLICE STATION AND GIVE YOU AWAY UNLESS YOU LET ME SHARE THIS ADVENTURE
WITH YOU
YOU CAN'T HELP ME
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT MAY HAPPEN
ANYWAY MY
RESOLUTION IS TAKEN
OTHER PEOPLE BESIDES YOU HAVE SELF RESPECT AND
EVEN REPUTATIONS
HOLMES HAD LOOKED ANNOYED BUT HIS BROW CLEARED AND HE CLAPPED ME ON
THE SHOULDER
WELL WELL MY DEAR FELLOW BE IT SO
WE HAVE SHARED THIS SAME ROOM
FOR SOME YEARS AND IT WOULD BE AMUSING IF WE ENDED BY SHARING THE
SAME CELL
YOU KNOW WATSON I DON'T MIND CONFESSING TO YOU THAT I HAVE
ALWAYS HAD AN IDEA THAT I WOULD HAVE MADE A HIGHLY EFFICIENT CRIMINAL
THIS IS THE CHANCE OF MY LIFETIME IN THAT DIRECTION
SEE HERE HE TOOK
A NEAT LITTLE LEATHER CASE OUT OF A DRAWER AND OPENING IT HE EXHIBITED
A NUMBER OF SHINING INSTRUMENTS
THIS IS A FIRST CLASS UP TO DATE
BURGLING KIT WITH NICKEL PLATED JEMMY DIAMOND TIPPED GLASS CUTTER
ADAPTABLE KEYS AND EVERY MODERN IMPROVEMENT WHICH THE MARCH OF
CIVILIZATION DEMANDS
HERE TOO IS MY DARK LANTERN
EVERYTHING IS IN
ORDER
HAVE YOU A PAIR OF SILENT SHOES
I HAVE RUBBER SOLED TENNIS SHOES
EXCELLENT AND A MASK
I CAN MAKE A COUPLE OUT OF BLACK SILK
I CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE A STRONG NATURAL TURN FOR THIS SORT OF THING
VERY GOOD DO YOU MAKE THE MASKS
WE SHALL HAVE SOME COLD SUPPER BEFORE
WE START
IT IS NOW NINE THIRTY
AT ELEVEN WE SHALL DRIVE AS FAR AS
CHURCH ROW
IT IS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S WALK FROM THERE TO APPLEDORE
TOWERS
WE SHALL BE AT WORK BEFORE MIDNIGHT
MILVERTON IS A HEAVY
SLEEPER AND RETIRES PUNCTUALLY AT TEN THIRTY
WITH ANY LUCK WE SHOULD
BE BACK HERE BY TWO WITH THE LADY EVA'S LETTERS IN MY POCKET
HOLMES AND I PUT ON OUR DRESS CLOTHES SO THAT WE MIGHT APPEAR TO BE TWO
THEATRE GOERS HOMEWARD BOUND
IN OXFORD STREET WE PICKED UP A HANSOM AND
DROVE TO AN ADDRESS IN HAMPSTEAD
HERE WE PAID OFF OUR CAB AND WITH OUR
GREAT COATS BUTTONED UP FOR IT WAS BITTERLY COLD AND THE WIND SEEMED
TO BLOW THROUGH US WE WALKED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE HEATH
IT'S A BUSINESS THAT NEEDS DELICATE TREATMENT SAID HOLMES
THESE
DOCUMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN A SAFE IN THE FELLOW'S STUDY AND THE STUDY
IS THE ANTE ROOM OF HIS BED CHAMBER
ON THE OTHER HAND LIKE ALL THESE
STOUT LITTLE MEN WHO DO THEMSELVES WELL HE IS A PLETHORIC SLEEPER
AGATHA THAT'S MY FIANCEE SAYS IT IS A JOKE IN THE SERVANTS' HALL THAT
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO WAKE THE MASTER
HE HAS A SECRETARY WHO IS DEVOTED
TO HIS INTERESTS AND NEVER BUDGES FROM THE STUDY ALL DAY
THAT'S WHY WE
ARE GOING AT NIGHT
THEN HE HAS A BEAST OF A DOG WHICH ROAMS THE GARDEN
I MET AGATHA LATE THE LAST TWO EVENINGS AND SHE LOCKS THE BRUTE UP SO
AS TO GIVE ME A CLEAR RUN
THIS IS THE HOUSE THIS BIG ONE IN ITS OWN
GROUNDS
THROUGH THE GATE NOW TO THE RIGHT AMONG THE LAURELS
WE MIGHT
PUT ON OUR MASKS HERE I THINK
YOU SEE THERE IS NOT A GLIMMER OF LIGHT
IN ANY OF THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING IS WORKING SPLENDIDLY
WITH OUR BLACK SILK FACE COVERINGS WHICH TURNED US INTO TWO OF THE MOST
TRUCULENT FIGURES IN LONDON WE STOLE UP TO THE SILENT GLOOMY HOUSE
A SORT OF TILED VERANDA EXTENDED ALONG ONE SIDE OF IT LINED BY SEVERAL
WINDOWS AND TWO DOORS
THAT'S HIS BEDROOM HOLMES WHISPERED
THIS DOOR OPENS STRAIGHT INTO
THE STUDY
IT WOULD SUIT US BEST BUT IT IS BOLTED AS WELL AS LOCKED
AND WE SHOULD MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE GETTING IN
COME ROUND HERE
THERE'S A
GREENHOUSE WHICH OPENS INTO THE DRAWING ROOM
THE PLACE WAS LOCKED BUT HOLMES REMOVED A CIRCLE OF GLASS AND TURNED
THE KEY FROM THE INSIDE
AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS HE HAD CLOSED THE DOOR
BEHIND US AND WE HAD BECOME FELONS IN THE EYES OF THE LAW
THE THICK
WARM AIR OF THE CONSERVATORY AND THE RICH CHOKING FRAGRANCE OF EXOTIC
PLANTS TOOK US BY THE THROAT
HE SEIZED MY HAND IN THE DARKNESS AND LED
ME SWIFTLY PAST BANKS OF SHRUBS WHICH BRUSHED AGAINST OUR FACES
HOLMES
HAD REMARKABLE POWERS CAREFULLY CULTIVATED OF SEEING IN THE DARK
STILL HOLDING MY HAND IN ONE OF HIS HE OPENED A DOOR AND I WAS VAGUELY
CONSCIOUS THAT WE HAD ENTERED A LARGE ROOM IN WHICH A CIGAR HAD BEEN
SMOKED NOT LONG BEFORE
HE FELT HIS WAY AMONG THE FURNITURE OPENED
ANOTHER DOOR AND CLOSED IT BEHIND US
PUTTING OUT MY HAND I FELT
SEVERAL COATS HANGING FROM THE WALL AND I UNDERSTOOD THAT I WAS IN A
PASSAGE
WE PASSED ALONG IT AND HOLMES VERY GENTLY OPENED A DOOR UPON
THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
SOMETHING RUSHED OUT AT US AND MY HEART SPRANG INTO
MY MOUTH BUT I COULD HAVE LAUGHED WHEN I REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE CAT
A FIRE WAS BURNING IN THIS NEW ROOM AND AGAIN THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH
TOBACCO SMOKE
HOLMES ENTERED ON TIPTOE WAITED FOR ME TO FOLLOW AND
THEN VERY GENTLY CLOSED THE DOOR
WE WERE IN MILVERTON'S STUDY AND A
PORTIERE AT THE FARTHER SIDE SHOWED THE ENTRANCE TO HIS BEDROOM
IT WAS A GOOD FIRE AND THE ROOM WAS ILLUMINATED BY IT
NEAR THE DOOR I
SAW THE GLEAM OF AN ELECTRIC SWITCH BUT IT WAS UNNECESSARY EVEN IF IT
HAD BEEN SAFE TO TURN IT ON
AT ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE WAS A HEAVY
CURTAIN WHICH COVERED THE BAY WINDOW WE HAD SEEN FROM OUTSIDE
ON THE
OTHER SIDE WAS THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATED WITH THE VERANDA
A DESK
STOOD IN THE CENTRE WITH A TURNING CHAIR OF SHINING RED LEATHER
OPPOSITE WAS A LARGE BOOKCASE WITH A MARBLE BUST OF ATHENE ON THE TOP
IN THE CORNER BETWEEN THE BOOKCASE AND THE WALL THERE STOOD A TALL
GREEN SAFE THE FIRELIGHT FLASHING BACK FROM THE POLISHED BRASS KNOBS
UPON ITS FACE
HOLMES STOLE ACROSS AND LOOKED AT IT
THEN HE CREPT
TO THE DOOR OF THE BEDROOM AND STOOD WITH SLANTING HEAD LISTENING
INTENTLY
NO SOUND CAME FROM WITHIN
MEANWHILE IT HAD STRUCK ME THAT
IT WOULD BE WISE TO SECURE OUR RETREAT THROUGH THE OUTER DOOR SO
I EXAMINED IT
TO MY AMAZEMENT IT WAS NEITHER LOCKED NOR BOLTED
I TOUCHED HOLMES ON THE ARM AND HE TURNED HIS MASKED FACE IN THAT
DIRECTION
I SAW HIM START AND HE WAS EVIDENTLY AS SURPRISED AS I
I DON'T LIKE IT HE WHISPERED PUTTING HIS LIPS TO MY VERY EAR
I
CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT OUT
ANYHOW WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
CAN I DO ANYTHING
YES STAND BY THE DOOR
IF YOU HEAR ANYONE COME BOLT IT ON THE INSIDE
AND WE CAN GET AWAY AS WE CAME
IF THEY COME THE OTHER WAY WE CAN
GET THROUGH THE DOOR IF OUR JOB IS DONE OR HIDE BEHIND THESE WINDOW
CURTAINS IF IT IS NOT
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I NODDED AND STOOD BY THE DOOR
MY FIRST FEELING OF FEAR HAD PASSED
AWAY AND I THRILLED NOW WITH A KEENER ZEST THAN I HAD EVER ENJOYED WHEN
WE WERE THE DEFENDERS OF THE LAW INSTEAD OF ITS DEFIERS
THE HIGH OBJECT
OF OUR MISSION THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT WAS UNSELFISH AND CHIVALROUS
THE VILLAINOUS CHARACTER OF OUR OPPONENT ALL ADDED TO THE SPORTING
INTEREST OF THE ADVENTURE
FAR FROM FEELING GUILTY I REJOICED AND
EXULTED IN OUR DANGERS
WITH A GLOW OF ADMIRATION I WATCHED HOLMES
UNROLLING HIS CASE OF INSTRUMENTS AND CHOOSING HIS TOOL WITH THE CALM
SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY OF A SURGEON WHO PERFORMS A DELICATE OPERATION
I
KNEW THAT THE OPENING OF SAFES WAS A PARTICULAR HOBBY WITH HIM AND I
UNDERSTOOD THE JOY WHICH IT GAVE HIM TO BE CONFRONTED WITH THIS GREEN
AND GOLD MONSTER THE DRAGON WHICH HELD IN ITS MAW THE REPUTATIONS OF
MANY FAIR LADIES
TURNING UP THE CUFFS OF HIS DRESS COAT HE HAD PLACED
HIS OVERCOAT ON A CHAIR HOLMES LAID OUT TWO DRILLS A JEMMY AND
SEVERAL SKELETON KEYS
I STOOD AT THE CENTRE DOOR WITH MY EYES GLANCING
AT EACH OF THE OTHERS READY FOR ANY EMERGENCY THOUGH INDEED MY PLANS
WERE SOMEWHAT VAGUE AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO IF WE WERE INTERRUPTED
FOR
HALF AN HOUR HOLMES WORKED WITH CONCENTRATED ENERGY LAYING DOWN ONE
TOOL PICKING UP ANOTHER HANDLING EACH WITH THE STRENGTH AND DELICACY
OF THE TRAINED MECHANIC
FINALLY I HEARD A CLICK THE BROAD GREEN DOOR
SWUNG OPEN AND INSIDE I HAD A GLIMPSE OF A NUMBER OF PAPER PACKETS
EACH TIED SEALED AND INSCRIBED
HOLMES PICKED ONE OUT BUT IT WAS AS
HARD TO READ BY THE FLICKERING FIRE AND HE DREW OUT HIS LITTLE DARK
LANTERN FOR IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS WITH MILVERTON IN THE NEXT ROOM TO
SWITCH ON THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
SUDDENLY I SAW HIM HALT LISTEN INTENTLY
AND THEN IN AN INSTANT HE HAD SWUNG THE DOOR OF THE SAFE TO PICKED
UP HIS COAT STUFFED HIS TOOLS INTO THE POCKETS AND DARTED BEHIND THE
WINDOW CURTAIN MOTIONING ME TO DO THE SAME
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I HAD JOINED HIM THERE THAT I HEARD WHAT HAD ALARMED
HIS QUICKER SENSES
THERE WAS A NOISE SOMEWHERE WITHIN THE HOUSE
A DOOR
SLAMMED IN THE DISTANCE
THEN A CONFUSED DULL MURMUR BROKE ITSELF INTO
THE MEASURED THUD OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS RAPIDLY APPROACHING
THEY WERE IN
THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE THE ROOM
THEY PAUSED AT THE DOOR
THE DOOR OPENED
THERE WAS A SHARP SNICK AS THE ELECTRIC LIGHT WAS TURNED ON
THE DOOR
CLOSED ONCE MORE AND THE PUNGENT REEK OF A STRONG CIGAR WAS BORNE
TO OUR NOSTRILS
THEN THE FOOTSTEPS CONTINUED BACKWARD AND FORWARD
BACKWARD AND FORWARD WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF US
FINALLY THERE WAS A
CREAK FROM A CHAIR AND THE FOOTSTEPS CEASED
THEN A KEY CLICKED IN A
LOCK AND I HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PAPERS
SO FAR I HAD NOT DARED TO LOOK OUT BUT NOW I GENTLY PARTED THE DIVISION
OF THE CURTAINS IN FRONT OF ME AND PEEPED THROUGH
FROM THE PRESSURE
OF HOLMES'S SHOULDER AGAINST MINE I KNEW THAT HE WAS SHARING MY
OBSERVATIONS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND ALMOST WITHIN OUR REACH WAS THE
BROAD ROUNDED BACK OF MILVERTON
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE HAD ENTIRELY
MISCALCULATED HIS MOVEMENTS THAT HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO HIS BEDROOM
BUT THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING UP IN SOME SMOKING OR BILLIARD ROOM IN THE
FARTHER WING OF THE HOUSE THE WINDOWS OF WHICH WE HAD NOT SEEN
HIS
BROAD GRIZZLED HEAD WITH ITS SHINING PATCH OF BALDNESS WAS IN THE
IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND OF OUR VISION
HE WAS LEANING FAR BACK IN THE RED
LEATHER CHAIR HIS LEGS OUTSTRETCHED A LONG BLACK CIGAR PROJECTING
AT AN ANGLE FROM HIS MOUTH
HE WORE A SEMI MILITARY SMOKING JACKET
CLARET COLOURED WITH A BLACK VELVET COLLAR
IN HIS HAND HE HELD A LONG
LEGAL DOCUMENT WHICH HE WAS READING IN AN INDOLENT FASHION BLOWING
RINGS OF TOBACCO SMOKE FROM HIS LIPS AS HE DID SO
THERE WAS NO PROMISE
OF A SPEEDY DEPARTURE IN HIS COMPOSED BEARING AND HIS COMFORTABLE
ATTITUDE
I FELT HOLMES'S HAND STEAL INTO MINE AND GIVE ME A REASSURING SHAKE AS
IF TO SAY THAT THE SITUATION WAS WITHIN HIS POWERS AND THAT HE WAS
EASY IN HIS MIND
I WAS NOT SURE WHETHER HE HAD SEEN WHAT WAS ONLY TOO
OBVIOUS FROM MY POSITION THAT THE DOOR OF THE SAFE WAS IMPERFECTLY
CLOSED AND THAT MILVERTON MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT OBSERVE IT
IN MY OWN
MIND I HAD DETERMINED THAT IF I WERE SURE FROM THE RIGIDITY OF HIS
GAZE THAT IT HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE I WOULD AT ONCE SPRING OUT THROW MY
GREAT COAT OVER HIS HEAD PINION HIM AND LEAVE THE REST TO HOLMES
BUT
MILVERTON NEVER LOOKED UP
HE WAS LANGUIDLY INTERESTED BY THE PAPERS IN
HIS HAND AND PAGE AFTER PAGE WAS TURNED AS HE FOLLOWED THE ARGUMENT OF
THE LAWYER
AT LEAST I THOUGHT WHEN HE HAS FINISHED THE DOCUMENT AND
THE CIGAR HE WILL GO TO HIS ROOM BUT BEFORE HE HAD REACHED THE END OF
EITHER THERE CAME A REMARKABLE DEVELOPMENT WHICH TURNED OUR THOUGHTS
INTO QUITE ANOTHER CHANNEL
SEVERAL TIMES I HAD OBSERVED THAT MILVERTON LOOKED AT HIS WATCH AND
ONCE HE HAD RISEN AND SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A GESTURE OF IMPATIENCE
THE
IDEA HOWEVER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT SO STRANGE AN
HOUR NEVER OCCURRED TO ME UNTIL A FAINT SOUND REACHED MY EARS FROM
THE VERANDA OUTSIDE
MILVERTON DROPPED HIS PAPERS AND SAT RIGID IN HIS
CHAIR
THE SOUND WAS REPEATED AND THEN THERE CAME A GENTLE TAP AT THE
DOOR
MILVERTON ROSE AND OPENED IT
WELL SAID HE CURTLY YOU ARE NEARLY HALF AN HOUR LATE
SO THIS WAS THE EXPLANATION OF THE UNLOCKED DOOR AND OF THE NOCTURNAL
VIGIL OF MILVERTON
THERE WAS THE GENTLE RUSTLE OF A WOMAN'S DRESS
I
HAD CLOSED THE SLIT BETWEEN THE CURTAINS AS MILVERTON'S FACE HAD TURNED
IN OUR DIRECTION BUT NOW I VENTURED VERY CAREFULLY TO OPEN IT ONCE
MORE
HE HAD RESUMED HIS SEAT THE CIGAR STILL PROJECTING AT AN INSOLENT
ANGLE FROM THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
IN FRONT OF HIM IN THE FULL GLARE
OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THERE STOOD A TALL SLIM DARK WOMAN A VEIL OVER
HER FACE A MANTLE DRAWN ROUND HER CHIN
HER BREATH CAME QUICK AND FAST
AND EVERY INCH OF THE LITHE FIGURE WAS QUIVERING WITH STRONG EMOTION
WELL SAID MILVERTON YOU MADE ME LOSE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST MY DEAR
I HOPE YOU'LL PROVE WORTH IT
YOU COULDN'T COME ANY OTHER TIME EH
THE WOMAN SHOOK HER HEAD
WELL IF YOU COULDN'T YOU COULDN'T
IF THE COUNTESS IS A HARD MISTRESS
YOU HAVE YOUR CHANCE TO GET LEVEL WITH HER NOW
BLESS THE GIRL WHAT ARE
YOU SHIVERING ABOUT THAT'S RIGHT
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
NOW LET US
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS HE TOOK A NOTEBOOK FROM THE DRAWER OF HIS DESK
YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE FIVE LETTERS WHICH COMPROMISE THE COUNTESS
D'ALBERT
YOU WANT TO SELL THEM
I WANT TO BUY THEM
SO FAR SO GOOD
IT
ONLY REMAINS TO FIX A PRICE
I SHOULD WANT TO INSPECT THE LETTERS OF
COURSE
IF THEY ARE REALLY GOOD SPECIMENS GREAT HEAVENS IS IT YOU
THE WOMAN WITHOUT A WORD HAD RAISED HER VEIL AND DROPPED THE MANTLE
FROM HER CHIN
IT WAS A DARK HANDSOME CLEAR CUT FACE WHICH CONFRONTED
MILVERTON A FACE WITH A CURVED NOSE STRONG DARK EYEBROWS SHADING
HARD GLITTERING EYES AND A STRAIGHT THIN LIPPED MOUTH SET IN A
DANGEROUS SMILE
IT IS I SHE SAID THE WOMAN WHOSE LIFE YOU HAVE RUINED
MILVERTON LAUGHED BUT FEAR VIBRATED IN HIS VOICE
YOU WERE SO VERY
OBSTINATE SAID HE
WHY DID YOU DRIVE ME TO SUCH EXTREMITIES I
ASSURE YOU I WOULDN'T HURT A FLY OF MY OWN ACCORD BUT EVERY MAN HAS HIS
BUSINESS AND WHAT WAS I TO DO I PUT THE PRICE WELL WITHIN YOUR MEANS
YOU WOULD NOT PAY
SO YOU SENT THE LETTERS TO MY HUSBAND AND HE THE NOBLEST GENTLEMAN
THAT EVER LIVED A MAN WHOSE BOOTS I WAS NEVER WORTHY TO LACE HE BROKE
HIS GALLANT HEART AND DIED
YOU REMEMBER THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN I CAME
THROUGH THAT DOOR I BEGGED AND PRAYED YOU FOR MERCY AND YOU LAUGHED
IN MY FACE AS YOU ARE TRYING TO LAUGH NOW ONLY YOUR COWARD HEART CANNOT
KEEP YOUR LIPS FROM TWITCHING
YES YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO SEE ME HERE
AGAIN BUT IT WAS THAT NIGHT WHICH TAUGHT ME HOW I COULD MEET YOU FACE
TO FACE AND ALONE
WELL CHARLES MILVERTON WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY
DON'T IMAGINE THAT YOU CAN BULLY ME SAID HE RISING TO HIS FEET
I
HAVE ONLY TO RAISE MY VOICE AND I COULD CALL MY SERVANTS AND HAVE YOU
ARRESTED
BUT I WILL MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR YOUR NATURAL ANGER
LEAVE THE
ROOM AT ONCE AS YOU CAME AND I WILL SAY NO MORE
THE WOMAN STOOD WITH HER HAND BURIED IN HER BOSOM AND THE SAME DEADLY
SMILE ON HER THIN LIPS
YOU WILL RUIN NO MORE LIVES AS YOU HAVE RUINED MINE
YOU WILL WRING
NO MORE HEARTS AS YOU WRUNG MINE
I WILL FREE THE WORLD OF A POISONOUS
THING
TAKE THAT YOU HOUND AND THAT AND THAT AND THAT
SHE HAD DRAWN A LITTLE GLEAMING REVOLVER AND EMPTIED BARREL AFTER
BARREL INTO MILVERTON'S BODY THE MUZZLE WITHIN TWO FEET OF HIS SHIRT
FRONT
HE SHRANK AWAY AND THEN FELL FORWARD UPON THE TABLE COUGHING
FURIOUSLY AND CLAWING AMONG THE PAPERS
THEN HE STAGGERED TO HIS FEET
RECEIVED ANOTHER SHOT AND ROLLED UPON THE FLOOR
YOU'VE DONE ME HE
CRIED AND LAY STILL
THE WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM INTENTLY AND GROUND HER
HEEL INTO HIS UPTURNED FACE
SHE LOOKED AGAIN BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND
OR MOVEMENT
I HEARD A SHARP RUSTLE THE NIGHT AIR BLEW INTO THE HEATED
ROOM AND THE AVENGER WAS GONE
NO INTERFERENCE UPON OUR PART COULD HAVE SAVED THE MAN FROM HIS FATE
BUT AS THE WOMAN POURED BULLET AFTER BULLET INTO MILVERTON'S SHRINKING
BODY I WAS ABOUT TO SPRING OUT WHEN I FELT HOLMES'S COLD STRONG GRASP
UPON MY WRIST
I UNDERSTOOD THE WHOLE ARGUMENT OF THAT FIRM RESTRAINING
GRIP THAT IT WAS NO AFFAIR OF OURS THAT JUSTICE HAD OVERTAKEN A
VILLAIN THAT WE HAD OUR OWN DUTIES AND OUR OWN OBJECTS WHICH WERE NOT
TO BE LOST SIGHT OF
BUT HARDLY HAD THE WOMAN RUSHED FROM THE ROOM WHEN
HOLMES WITH SWIFT SILENT STEPS WAS OVER AT THE OTHER DOOR
HE TURNED
THE KEY IN THE LOCK
AT THE SAME INSTANT WE HEARD VOICES IN THE HOUSE
AND THE SOUND OF HURRYING FEET
THE REVOLVER SHOTS HAD ROUSED THE
HOUSEHOLD
WITH PERFECT COOLNESS HOLMES SLIPPED ACROSS TO THE SAFE
FILLED HIS TWO ARMS WITH BUNDLES OF LETTERS AND POURED THEM ALL INTO
THE FIRE
AGAIN AND AGAIN HE DID IT UNTIL THE SAFE WAS EMPTY
SOMEONE
TURNED THE HANDLE AND BEAT UPON THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR
HOLMES LOOKED
SWIFTLY ROUND
THE LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER OF DEATH FOR
MILVERTON LAY ALL MOTTLED WITH HIS BLOOD UPON THE TABLE
HOLMES TOSSED
IT IN AMONG THE BLAZING PAPERS
THEN HE DREW THE KEY FROM THE OUTER
DOOR PASSED THROUGH AFTER ME AND LOCKED IT ON THE OUTSIDE
THIS WAY
WATSON SAID HE WE CAN SCALE THE GARDEN WALL IN THIS DIRECTION
I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT AN ALARM COULD HAVE SPREAD SO SWIFTLY
LOOKING BACK THE HUGE HOUSE WAS ONE BLAZE OF LIGHT
THE FRONT DOOR
WAS OPEN AND FIGURES WERE RUSHING DOWN THE DRIVE
THE WHOLE GARDEN WAS
ALIVE WITH PEOPLE AND ONE FELLOW RAISED A VIEW HALLOA AS WE EMERGED
FROM THE VERANDA AND FOLLOWED HARD AT OUR HEELS
HOLMES SEEMED TO
KNOW THE GROUNDS PERFECTLY AND HE THREADED HIS WAY SWIFTLY AMONG
A PLANTATION OF SMALL TREES I CLOSE AT HIS HEELS AND OUR FOREMOST
PURSUER PANTING BEHIND US
IT WAS A SIX FOOT WALL WHICH BARRED OUR PATH
BUT HE SPRANG TO THE TOP AND OVER
AS I DID THE SAME I FELT THE HAND
OF THE MAN BEHIND ME GRAB AT MY ANKLE BUT I KICKED MYSELF FREE AND
SCRAMBLED OVER A GRASS STREWN COPING
I FELL UPON MY FACE AMONG SOME
BUSHES BUT HOLMES HAD ME ON MY FEET IN AN INSTANT AND TOGETHER WE
DASHED AWAY ACROSS THE HUGE EXPANSE OF HAMPSTEAD HEATH
WE HAD RUN TWO
MILES I SUPPOSE BEFORE HOLMES AT LAST HALTED AND LISTENED INTENTLY
ALL WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE BEHIND US
WE HAD SHAKEN OFF OUR PURSUERS AND
WERE SAFE
WE HAD BREAKFASTED AND WERE SMOKING OUR MORNING PIPE ON THE DAY AFTER
THE REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE WHICH I HAVE RECORDED WHEN MR
LESTRADE OF
SCOTLAND YARD VERY SOLEMN AND IMPRESSIVE WAS USHERED INTO OUR MODEST
SITTING ROOM
GOOD MORNING MR
HOLMES SAID HE GOOD MORNING
MAY I ASK IF YOU ARE
VERY BUSY JUST NOW
NOT TOO BUSY TO LISTEN TO YOU
I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOTHING PARTICULAR ON HAND YOU
MIGHT CARE TO ASSIST US IN A MOST REMARKABLE CASE WHICH OCCURRED ONLY
LAST NIGHT AT HAMPSTEAD
DEAR ME SAID HOLMES
WHAT WAS THAT
A MURDER A MOST DRAMATIC AND REMARKABLE MURDER
I KNOW HOW KEEN YOU
ARE UPON THESE THINGS AND I WOULD TAKE IT AS A GREAT FAVOUR IF YOU
WOULD STEP DOWN TO APPLEDORE TOWERS AND GIVE US THE BENEFIT OF YOUR
ADVICE
IT IS NO ORDINARY CRIME
WE HAVE HAD OUR EYES UPON THIS MR
MILVERTON FOR SOME TIME AND BETWEEN OURSELVES HE WAS A BIT OF A
VILLAIN
HE IS KNOWN TO HAVE HELD PAPERS WHICH HE USED FOR BLACKMAILING
PURPOSES
THESE PAPERS HAVE ALL BEEN BURNED BY THE MURDERERS
NO ARTICLE
OF VALUE WAS TAKEN AS IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CRIMINALS WERE MEN OF
GOOD POSITION WHOSE SOLE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT SOCIAL EXPOSURE
CRIMINALS SAID HOLMES
PLURAL
YES THERE WERE TWO OF THEM
THEY WERE AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE CAPTURED
RED HANDED
WE HAVE THEIR FOOTMARKS WE HAVE THEIR DESCRIPTION IT'S TEN
TO ONE THAT WE TRACE THEM
THE FIRST FELLOW WAS A BIT TOO ACTIVE BUT
THE SECOND WAS CAUGHT BY THE UNDER GARDENER AND ONLY GOT AWAY AFTER A
STRUGGLE
HE WAS A MIDDLE SIZED STRONGLY BUILT MAN SQUARE JAW THICK
NECK MOUSTACHE A MASK OVER HIS EYES
THAT'S RATHER VAGUE SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
MY IT MIGHT BE A
DESCRIPTION OF WATSON
IT'S TRUE SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH AMUSEMENT
IT MIGHT BE A
DESCRIPTION OF WATSON
WELL I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP YOU LESTRADE SAID HOLMES
THE FACT IS
THAT I KNEW THIS FELLOW MILVERTON THAT I CONSIDERED HIM ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS MEN IN LONDON AND THAT I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN CRIMES
WHICH THE LAW CANNOT TOUCH AND WHICH THEREFORE TO SOME EXTENT JUSTIFY
PRIVATE REVENGE
NO IT'S NO USE ARGUING
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND
MY
SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE CRIMINALS RATHER THAN WITH THE VICTIM AND I
WILL NOT HANDLE THIS CASE
HOLMES HAD NOT SAID ONE WORD TO ME ABOUT THE TRAGEDY WHICH WE HAD
WITNESSED BUT I OBSERVED ALL THE MORNING THAT HE WAS IN HIS MOST
THOUGHTFUL MOOD AND HE GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION FROM HIS VACANT EYES AND
HIS ABSTRACTED MANNER OF A MAN WHO IS STRIVING TO RECALL SOMETHING TO
HIS MEMORY
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR LUNCH WHEN HE SUDDENLY SPRANG
TO HIS FEET
BY JOVE WATSON I'VE GOT IT HE CRIED
TAKE YOUR HAT
COME WITH ME HE HURRIED AT HIS TOP SPEED DOWN BAKER STREET AND ALONG
OXFORD STREET UNTIL WE HAD ALMOST REACHED REGENT CIRCUS
HERE ON THE
LEFT HAND THERE STANDS A SHOP WINDOW FILLED WITH PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE
CELEBRITIES AND BEAUTIES OF THE DAY
HOLMES'S EYES FIXED THEMSELVES UPON
ONE OF THEM AND FOLLOWING HIS GAZE I SAW THE PICTURE OF A REGAL AND
STATELY LADY IN COURT DRESS WITH A HIGH DIAMOND TIARA UPON HER NOBLE
HEAD
I LOOKED AT THAT DELICATELY CURVED NOSE AT THE MARKED EYEBROWS
AT THE STRAIGHT MOUTH AND THE STRONG LITTLE CHIN BENEATH IT
THEN I
CAUGHT MY BREATH AS I READ THE TIME HONOURED TITLE OF THE GREAT NOBLEMAN
AND STATESMAN WHOSE WIFE SHE HAD BEEN
MY EYES MET THOSE OF HOLMES AND
HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS AS WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE WINDOW
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS
IT WAS NO VERY UNUSUAL THING FOR MR
LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD TO
LOOK IN UPON US OF AN EVENING AND HIS VISITS WERE WELCOME TO SHERLOCK
HOLMES FOR THEY ENABLED HIM TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ALL THAT WAS GOING ON
AT THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS
IN RETURN FOR THE NEWS WHICH LESTRADE WOULD
BRING HOLMES WAS ALWAYS READY TO LISTEN WITH ATTENTION TO THE
DETAILS OF ANY CASE UPON WHICH THE DETECTIVE WAS ENGAGED AND WAS ABLE
OCCASIONALLY WITHOUT ANY ACTIVE INTERFERENCE TO GIVE SOME HINT OR
SUGGESTION DRAWN FROM HIS OWN VAST KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE
ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING LESTRADE HAD SPOKEN OF THE WEATHER AND
THE NEWSPAPERS
THEN HE HAD FALLEN SILENT PUFFING THOUGHTFULLY AT HIS
CIGAR
HOLMES LOOKED KEENLY AT HIM
ANYTHING REMARKABLE ON HAND HE ASKED
OH NO MR
HOLMES NOTHING VERY PARTICULAR
THEN TELL ME ABOUT IT
LESTRADE LAUGHED
WELL MR
HOLMES THERE IS NO USE DENYING THAT THERE IS SOMETHING ON MY
MIND
AND YET IT IS SUCH AN ABSURD BUSINESS THAT I HESITATED TO
BOTHER YOU ABOUT IT
ON THE OTHER HAND ALTHOUGH IT IS TRIVIAL IT IS
UNDOUBTEDLY QUEER AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR ALL THAT IS OUT
OF THE COMMON
BUT IN MY OPINION IT COMES MORE IN DR
WATSON'S LINE
THAN OURS
DISEASE SAID I
MADNESS ANYHOW
AND A QUEER MADNESS TOO
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THERE WAS
ANYONE LIVING AT THIS TIME OF DAY WHO HAD SUCH A HATRED OF NAPOLEON THE
FIRST THAT HE WOULD BREAK ANY IMAGE OF HIM THAT HE COULD SEE
HOLMES SANK BACK IN HIS CHAIR
THAT'S NO BUSINESS OF MINE SAID HE
EXACTLY
THAT'S WHAT I SAID
BUT THEN WHEN THE MAN COMMITS BURGLARY
IN ORDER TO BREAK IMAGES WHICH ARE NOT HIS OWN THAT BRINGS IT AWAY FROM
THE DOCTOR AND ON TO THE POLICEMAN
HOLMES SAT UP AGAIN
BURGLARY THIS IS MORE INTERESTING
LET ME HEAR THE DETAILS
LESTRADE TOOK OUT HIS OFFICIAL NOTEBOOK AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY FROM
ITS PAGES
THE FIRST CASE REPORTED WAS FOUR DAYS AGO SAID HE
IT WAS AT THE
SHOP OF MORSE HUDSON WHO HAS A PLACE FOR THE SALE OF PICTURES AND
STATUES IN THE KENNINGTON ROAD
THE ASSISTANT HAD LEFT THE FRONT SHOP
FOR AN INSTANT WHEN HE HEARD A CRASH AND HURRYING IN HE FOUND A
PLASTER BUST OF NAPOLEON WHICH STOOD WITH SEVERAL OTHER WORKS OF ART
UPON THE COUNTER LYING SHIVERED INTO FRAGMENTS
HE RUSHED OUT INTO THE
ROAD BUT ALTHOUGH SEVERAL PASSERS BY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD NOTICED A
MAN RUN OUT OF THE SHOP HE COULD NEITHER SEE ANYONE NOR COULD HE
FIND ANY MEANS OF IDENTIFYING THE RASCAL
IT SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THOSE
SENSELESS ACTS OF HOOLIGANISM WHICH OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT WAS
REPORTED TO THE CONSTABLE ON THE BEAT AS SUCH
THE PLASTER CAST WAS NOT
WORTH MORE THAN A FEW SHILLINGS AND THE WHOLE AFFAIR APPEARED TO BE TOO
CHILDISH FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION
THE SECOND CASE HOWEVER WAS MORE SERIOUS AND ALSO MORE SINGULAR
IT
OCCURRED ONLY LAST NIGHT
IN KENNINGTON ROAD AND WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF MORSE HUDSON'S
SHOP THERE LIVES A WELL KNOWN MEDICAL PRACTITIONER NAMED DR
BARNICOT
WHO HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRACTICES UPON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE THAMES
HIS RESIDENCE AND PRINCIPAL CONSULTING ROOM IS AT KENNINGTON ROAD BUT
HE HAS A BRANCH SURGERY AND DISPENSARY AT LOWER BRIXTON ROAD TWO MILES
AWAY
THIS DR
BARNICOT IS AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF NAPOLEON AND HIS
HOUSE IS FULL OF BOOKS PICTURES AND RELICS OF THE FRENCH EMPEROR
SOME
LITTLE TIME AGO HE PURCHASED FROM MORSE HUDSON TWO DUPLICATE PLASTER
CASTS OF THE FAMOUS HEAD OF NAPOLEON BY THE FRENCH SCULPTOR DEVINE
ONE
OF THESE HE PLACED IN HIS HALL IN THE HOUSE AT KENNINGTON ROAD AND THE
OTHER ON THE MANTELPIECE OF THE SURGERY AT LOWER BRIXTON
WELL WHEN DR
BARNICOT CAME DOWN THIS MORNING HE WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT HIS HOUSE
HAD BEEN BURGLED DURING THE NIGHT BUT THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN SAVE
THE PLASTER HEAD FROM THE HALL
IT HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AND HAD BEEN
DASHED SAVAGELY AGAINST THE GARDEN WALL UNDER WHICH ITS SPLINTERED
FRAGMENTS WERE DISCOVERED
HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS
THIS IS CERTAINLY VERY NOVEL SAID HE
I THOUGHT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU
BUT I HAVE NOT GOT TO THE END YET
DR
BARNICOT WAS DUE AT HIS SURGERY AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND YOU CAN IMAGINE
HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN ON ARRIVING THERE HE FOUND THAT THE WINDOW HAD BEEN
OPENED IN THE NIGHT AND THAT THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS SECOND BUST WERE
STREWN ALL OVER THE ROOM
IT HAD BEEN SMASHED TO ATOMS WHERE IT STOOD
IN NEITHER CASE WERE THERE ANY SIGNS WHICH COULD GIVE US A CLUE AS TO
THE CRIMINAL OR LUNATIC WHO HAD DONE THE MISCHIEF
NOW MR
HOLMES YOU
HAVE GOT THE FACTS
THEY ARE SINGULAR NOT TO SAY GROTESQUE SAID HOLMES
MAY I ASK
WHETHER THE TWO BUSTS SMASHED IN DR
BARNICOT'S ROOMS WERE THE EXACT
DUPLICATES OF THE ONE WHICH WAS DESTROYED IN MORSE HUDSON'S SHOP
THEY WERE TAKEN FROM THE SAME MOULD
SUCH A FACT MUST TELL AGAINST THE THEORY THAT THE MAN WHO BREAKS THEM
IS INFLUENCED BY ANY GENERAL HATRED OF NAPOLEON
CONSIDERING HOW MANY
HUNDREDS OF STATUES OF THE GREAT EMPEROR MUST EXIST IN LONDON IT IS
TOO MUCH TO SUPPOSE SUCH A COINCIDENCE AS THAT A PROMISCUOUS ICONOCLAST
SHOULD CHANCE TO BEGIN UPON THREE SPECIMENS OF THE SAME BUST
WELL I THOUGHT AS YOU DO SAID LESTRADE
ON THE OTHER HAND THIS
MORSE HUDSON IS THE PURVEYOR OF BUSTS IN THAT PART OF LONDON AND THESE
THREE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHICH HAD BEEN IN HIS SHOP FOR YEARS
SO
ALTHOUGH AS YOU SAY THERE ARE MANY HUNDREDS OF STATUES IN LONDON IT
IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THESE THREE WERE THE ONLY ONES IN THAT DISTRICT
THEREFORE A LOCAL FANATIC WOULD BEGIN WITH THEM
WHAT DO YOU THINK DR
WATSON
THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF MONOMANIA I ANSWERED
THERE IS THE CONDITION WHICH THE MODERN FRENCH PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE
CALLED THE 'IDEE FIXE WHICH MAY BE TRIFLING IN CHARACTER AND
ACCOMPANIED BY COMPLETE SANITY IN EVERY OTHER WAY
A MAN WHO HAD READ
DEEPLY ABOUT NAPOLEON OR WHO HAD POSSIBLY RECEIVED SOME HEREDITARY
FAMILY INJURY THROUGH THE GREAT WAR MIGHT CONCEIVABLY FORM SUCH AN IDEE
FIXE AND UNDER ITS INFLUENCE BE CAPABLE OF ANY FANTASTIC OUTRAGE
THAT WON'T DO MY DEAR WATSON SAID HOLMES SHAKING HIS HEAD FOR NO
AMOUNT OF IDEE FIXE WOULD ENABLE YOUR INTERESTING MONOMANIAC TO FIND OUT
WHERE THESE BUSTS WERE SITUATED
WELL HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN IT
I DON'T ATTEMPT TO DO SO
I WOULD ONLY OBSERVE THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN
METHOD IN THE GENTLEMAN'S ECCENTRIC PROCEEDINGS
FOR EXAMPLE IN DR
BARNICOT'S HALL WHERE A SOUND MIGHT AROUSE THE FAMILY THE BUST WAS
TAKEN OUTSIDE BEFORE BEING BROKEN WHEREAS IN THE SURGERY WHERE THERE
WAS LESS DANGER OF AN ALARM IT WAS SMASHED WHERE IT STOOD
THE AFFAIR
SEEMS ABSURDLY TRIFLING AND YET I DARE CALL NOTHING TRIVIAL WHEN I
REFLECT THAT SOME OF MY MOST CLASSIC CASES HAVE HAD THE LEAST PROMISING
COMMENCEMENT
YOU WILL REMEMBER WATSON HOW THE DREADFUL BUSINESS OF
THE ABERNETTY FAMILY WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO MY NOTICE BY THE DEPTH WHICH
THE PARSLEY HAD SUNK INTO THE BUTTER UPON A HOT DAY
I CAN'T AFFORD
THEREFORE TO SMILE AT YOUR THREE BROKEN BUSTS LESTRADE AND I SHALL
BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU IF YOU WILL LET ME HEAR OF ANY FRESH
DEVELOPMENT OF SO SINGULAR A CHAIN OF EVENTS
THE DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH MY FRIEND HAD ASKED CAME IN A QUICKER AND AN
INFINITELY MORE TRAGIC FORM THAN HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED
I WAS STILL
DRESSING IN MY BEDROOM NEXT MORNING WHEN THERE WAS A TAP AT THE DOOR
AND HOLMES ENTERED A TELEGRAM IN HIS HAND
HE READ IT ALOUD
COME INSTANTLY 131 PITT STREET KENSINGTON
LESTRADE
WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED
DON'T KNOW MAY BE ANYTHING
BUT I SUSPECT IT IS THE SEQUEL OF THE
STORY OF THE STATUES
IN THAT CASE OUR FRIEND THE IMAGE BREAKER HAS
BEGUN OPERATIONS IN ANOTHER QUARTER OF LONDON
THERE'S COFFEE ON THE
TABLE WATSON AND I HAVE A CAB AT THE DOOR
IN HALF AN HOUR WE HAD REACHED PITT STREET A QUIET LITTLE BACKWATER
JUST BESIDE ONE OF THE BRISKEST CURRENTS OF LONDON LIFE
NO
131 WAS ONE
OF A ROW ALL FLAT CHESTED RESPECTABLE AND MOST UNROMANTIC DWELLINGS
AS WE DROVE UP WE FOUND THE RAILINGS IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE LINED BY A
CURIOUS CROWD
HOLMES WHISTLED
BY GEORGE IT'S ATTEMPTED MURDER AT THE LEAST
NOTHING LESS WILL HOLD
THE LONDON MESSAGE BOY
THERE'S A DEED OF VIOLENCE INDICATED IN THAT
FELLOW'S ROUND SHOULDERS AND OUTSTRETCHED NECK
WHAT'S THIS WATSON THE
TOP STEPS SWILLED DOWN AND THE OTHER ONES DRY
FOOTSTEPS ENOUGH ANYHOW
WELL WELL THERE'S LESTRADE AT THE FRONT WINDOW AND WE SHALL SOON KNOW
ALL ABOUT IT
THE OFFICIAL RECEIVED US WITH A VERY GRAVE FACE AND SHOWED US INTO A
SITTING ROOM WHERE AN EXCEEDINGLY UNKEMPT AND AGITATED ELDERLY
MAN CLAD IN A FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN WAS PACING UP AND DOWN
HE WAS
INTRODUCED TO US AS THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE MR
HORACE HARKER OF THE
CENTRAL PRESS SYNDICATE
IT'S THE NAPOLEON BUST BUSINESS AGAIN SAID LESTRADE
YOU SEEMED
INTERESTED LAST NIGHT MR
HOLMES SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE
GLAD TO BE PRESENT NOW THAT THE AFFAIR HAS TAKEN A VERY MUCH GRAVER
TURN
WHAT HAS IT TURNED TO THEN
TO MURDER
MR
HARKER WILL YOU TELL THESE GENTLEMEN EXACTLY WHAT HAS
OCCURRED
THE MAN IN THE DRESSING GOWN TURNED UPON US WITH A MOST MELANCHOLY FACE
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY THING SAID HE THAT ALL MY LIFE I HAVE BEEN
COLLECTING OTHER PEOPLE'S NEWS AND NOW THAT A REAL PIECE OF NEWS HAS
COME MY OWN WAY I AM SO CONFUSED AND BOTHERED THAT I CAN'T PUT TWO
WORDS TOGETHER
IF I HAD COME IN HERE AS A JOURNALIST I SHOULD HAVE
INTERVIEWED MYSELF AND HAD TWO COLUMNS IN EVERY EVENING PAPER
AS IT IS
I AM GIVING AWAY VALUABLE COPY BY TELLING MY STORY OVER AND OVER TO A
STRING OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I CAN MAKE NO USE OF IT MYSELF
HOWEVER
I'VE HEARD YOUR NAME MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND IF YOU'LL ONLY EXPLAIN
THIS QUEER BUSINESS I SHALL BE PAID FOR MY TROUBLE IN TELLING YOU THE
STORY
HOLMES SAT DOWN AND LISTENED
IT ALL SEEMS TO CENTRE ROUND THAT BUST OF NAPOLEON WHICH I BOUGHT FOR
THIS VERY ROOM ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO
I PICKED IT UP CHEAP FROM HARDING
BROTHERS TWO DOORS FROM THE HIGH STREET STATION
A GREAT DEAL OF MY
JOURNALISTIC WORK IS DONE AT NIGHT AND I OFTEN WRITE UNTIL THE EARLY
MORNING
SO IT WAS TO DAY
I WAS SITTING IN MY DEN WHICH IS AT THE BACK
OF THE TOP OF THE HOUSE ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK WHEN I WAS CONVINCED THAT
I HEARD SOME SOUNDS DOWNSTAIRS
I LISTENED BUT THEY WERE NOT REPEATED
AND I CONCLUDED THAT THEY CAME FROM OUTSIDE
THEN SUDDENLY ABOUT FIVE
MINUTES LATER THERE CAME A MOST HORRIBLE YELL THE MOST DREADFUL SOUND
MR
HOLMES THAT EVER I HEARD
IT WILL RING IN MY EARS AS LONG AS I
LIVE
I SAT FROZEN WITH HORROR FOR A MINUTE OR TWO
THEN I SEIZED THE
POKER AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS
WHEN I ENTERED THIS ROOM I FOUND THE WINDOW
WIDE OPEN AND I AT ONCE OBSERVED THAT THE BUST WAS GONE FROM THE
MANTELPIECE
WHY ANY BURGLAR SHOULD TAKE SUCH A THING PASSES MY
UNDERSTANDING FOR IT WAS ONLY A PLASTER CAST AND OF NO REAL VALUE
WHATEVER
YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT ANYONE GOING OUT THROUGH THAT OPEN WINDOW
COULD REACH THE FRONT DOORSTEP BY TAKING A LONG STRIDE
THIS WAS CLEARLY
WHAT THE BURGLAR HAD DONE SO I WENT ROUND AND OPENED THE DOOR
STEPPING
OUT INTO THE DARK I NEARLY FELL OVER A DEAD MAN WHO WAS LYING THERE
I
RAN BACK FOR A LIGHT AND THERE WAS THE POOR FELLOW A GREAT GASH IN HIS
THROAT AND THE WHOLE PLACE SWIMMING IN BLOOD
HE LAY ON HIS BACK HIS
KNEES DRAWN UP AND HIS MOUTH HORRIBLY OPEN
I SHALL SEE HIM IN MY
DREAMS
I HAD JUST TIME TO BLOW ON MY POLICE WHISTLE AND THEN I MUST
HAVE FAINTED FOR I KNEW NOTHING MORE UNTIL I FOUND THE POLICEMAN
STANDING OVER ME IN THE HALL
WELL WHO WAS THE MURDERED MAN ASKED HOLMES
THERE'S NOTHING TO SHOW WHO HE WAS SAID LESTRADE
YOU SHALL SEE THE
BODY AT THE MORTUARY BUT WE HAVE MADE NOTHING OF IT UP TO NOW
HE IS A
TALL MAN SUNBURNED VERY POWERFUL NOT MORE THAN THIRTY
HE IS POORLY
DRESSED AND YET DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A LABOURER
A HORN HANDLED CLASP
KNIFE WAS LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD BESIDE HIM
WHETHER IT WAS THE WEAPON
WHICH DID THE DEED OR WHETHER IT BELONGED TO THE DEAD MAN I DO NOT
KNOW
THERE WAS NO NAME ON HIS CLOTHING AND NOTHING IN HIS POCKETS SAVE
AN APPLE SOME STRING A SHILLING MAP OF LONDON AND A PHOTOGRAPH
HERE
IT IS
IT WAS EVIDENTLY TAKEN BY A SNAPSHOT FROM A SMALL CAMERA
IT REPRESENTED
AN ALERT SHARP FEATURED SIMIAN MAN WITH THICK EYEBROWS AND A VERY
PECULIAR PROJECTION OF THE LOWER PART OF THE FACE LIKE THE MUZZLE OF A
BABOON
AND WHAT BECAME OF THE BUST ASKED HOLMES AFTER A CAREFUL STUDY OF
THIS PICTURE
WE HAD NEWS OF IT JUST BEFORE YOU CAME
IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN THE FRONT
GARDEN OF AN EMPTY HOUSE IN CAMPDEN HOUSE ROAD
IT WAS BROKEN INTO
FRAGMENTS
I AM GOING ROUND NOW TO SEE IT
WILL YOU COME
CERTAINLY
I MUST JUST TAKE ONE LOOK ROUND HE EXAMINED THE CARPET AND
THE WINDOW
THE FELLOW HAD EITHER VERY LONG LEGS OR WAS A MOST ACTIVE
MAN SAID HE
WITH AN AREA BENEATH IT WAS NO MEAN FEAT TO REACH
THAT WINDOW LEDGE AND OPEN THAT WINDOW
GETTING BACK WAS COMPARATIVELY
SIMPLE
ARE YOU COMING WITH US TO SEE THE REMAINS OF YOUR BUST MR
HARKER
THE DISCONSOLATE JOURNALIST HAD SEATED HIMSELF AT A WRITING TABLE
I MUST TRY AND MAKE SOMETHING OF IT SAID HE THOUGH I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT THE FIRST EDITIONS OF THE EVENING PAPERS ARE OUT ALREADY WITH
FULL DETAILS
IT'S LIKE MY LUCK YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE STAND FELL AT
DONCASTER WELL I WAS THE ONLY JOURNALIST IN THE STAND AND MY JOURNAL
THE ONLY ONE THAT HAD NO ACCOUNT OF IT FOR I WAS TOO SHAKEN TO WRITE
IT
AND NOW I'LL BE TOO LATE WITH A MURDER DONE ON MY OWN DOORSTEP
AS WE LEFT THE ROOM WE HEARD HIS PEN TRAVELLING SHRILLY OVER THE
FOOLSCAP
THE SPOT WHERE THE FRAGMENTS OF THE BUST HAD BEEN FOUND WAS ONLY A
FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
FOR THE FIRST TIME OUR EYES RESTED UPON THIS
PRESENTMENT OF THE GREAT EMPEROR WHICH SEEMED TO RAISE SUCH FRANTIC
AND DESTRUCTIVE HATRED IN THE MIND OF THE UNKNOWN
IT LAY SCATTERED IN
SPLINTERED SHARDS UPON THE GRASS
HOLMES PICKED UP SEVERAL OF THEM AND
EXAMINED THEM CAREFULLY
I WAS CONVINCED FROM HIS INTENT FACE AND HIS
PURPOSEFUL MANNER THAT AT LAST HE WAS UPON A CLUE
WELL ASKED LESTRADE
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO YET SAID HE
AND YET AND YET WELL WE
HAVE SOME SUGGESTIVE FACTS TO ACT UPON
THE POSSESSION OF THIS TRIFLING
BUST WAS WORTH MORE IN THE EYES OF THIS STRANGE CRIMINAL THAN A HUMAN
LIFE
THAT IS ONE POINT
THEN THERE IS THE SINGULAR FACT THAT HE DID NOT
BREAK IT IN THE HOUSE OR IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE IF TO BREAK IT
WAS HIS SOLE OBJECT
HE WAS RATTLED AND BUSTLED BY MEETING THIS OTHER FELLOW
HE HARDLY KNEW
WHAT HE WAS DOING
WELL THAT'S LIKELY ENOUGH
BUT I WISH TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION VERY
PARTICULARLY TO THE POSITION OF THIS HOUSE IN THE GARDEN OF WHICH THE
BUST WAS DESTROYED
LESTRADE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
IT WAS AN EMPTY HOUSE AND SO HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NOT BE DISTURBED IN
THE GARDEN
YES BUT THERE IS ANOTHER EMPTY HOUSE FARTHER UP THE STREET WHICH HE
MUST HAVE PASSED BEFORE HE CAME TO THIS ONE
WHY DID HE NOT BREAK IT
THERE SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT EVERY YARD THAT HE CARRIED IT INCREASED
THE RISK OF SOMEONE MEETING HIM
I GIVE IT UP SAID LESTRADE
HOLMES POINTED TO THE STREET LAMP ABOVE OUR HEADS
HE COULD SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING HERE AND HE COULD NOT THERE
THAT WAS
HIS REASON
BY JOVE THAT'S TRUE SAID THE DETECTIVE
NOW THAT I COME TO THINK OF
IT DR
BARNICOT'S BUST WAS BROKEN NOT FAR FROM HIS RED LAMP
WELL MR
HOLMES WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH THAT FACT
TO REMEMBER IT TO DOCKET IT
WE MAY COME ON SOMETHING LATER WHICH WILL
BEAR UPON IT
WHAT STEPS DO YOU PROPOSE TO TAKE NOW LESTRADE
THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY OF GETTING AT IT IN MY OPINION IS TO IDENTIFY
THE DEAD MAN
THERE SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT THAT
WHEN WE HAVE
FOUND WHO HE IS AND WHO HIS ASSOCIATES ARE WE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD START
IN LEARNING WHAT HE WAS DOING IN PITT STREET LAST NIGHT AND WHO IT WAS
WHO MET HIM AND KILLED HIM ON THE DOORSTEP OF MR
HORACE HARKER
DON'T
YOU THINK SO
NO DOUBT AND YET IT IS NOT QUITE THE WAY IN WHICH I SHOULD APPROACH
THE CASE
WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN
OH YOU MUST NOT LET ME INFLUENCE YOU IN ANY WAY
I SUGGEST THAT YOU
GO ON YOUR LINE AND I ON MINE
WE CAN COMPARE NOTES AFTERWARDS AND EACH
WILL SUPPLEMENT THE OTHER
VERY GOOD SAID LESTRADE
IF YOU ARE GOING BACK TO PITT STREET YOU MIGHT SEE MR
HORACE HARKER
TELL HIM FOR ME THAT I HAVE QUITE MADE UP MY MIND AND THAT IT IS
CERTAIN THAT A DANGEROUS HOMICIDAL LUNATIC WITH NAPOLEONIC DELUSIONS
WAS IN HIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT
IT WILL BE USEFUL FOR HIS ARTICLE
LESTRADE STARED
YOU DON'T SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT
HOLMES SMILED
DON'T I WELL PERHAPS I DON'T
BUT I AM SURE THAT IT WILL INTEREST MR
HORACE HARKER AND THE SUBSCRIBERS OF THE CENTRAL PRESS SYNDICATE
NOW WATSON I THINK THAT WE SHALL FIND THAT WE HAVE A LONG AND RATHER
COMPLEX DAY'S WORK BEFORE US
I SHOULD BE GLAD LESTRADE IF YOU COULD
MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO MEET US AT BAKER STREET AT SIX O'CLOCK THIS
EVENING
UNTIL THEN I SHOULD LIKE TO KEEP THIS PHOTOGRAPH FOUND IN THE
DEAD MAN'S POCKET
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY HAVE TO ASK YOUR COMPANY
AND ASSISTANCE UPON A SMALL EXPEDITION WHICH WILL HAVE BE UNDERTAKEN
TO NIGHT IF MY CHAIN OF REASONING SHOULD PROVE TO BE CORRECT
UNTIL
THEN GOOD BYE AND GOOD LUCK
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I WALKED TOGETHER TO THE HIGH STREET WHERE WE
STOPPED AT THE SHOP OF HARDING BROTHERS WHENCE THE BUST HAD BEEN
PURCHASED
A YOUNG ASSISTANT INFORMED US THAT MR
HARDING WOULD BE
ABSENT UNTIL AFTERNOON AND THAT HE WAS HIMSELF A NEWCOMER WHO COULD
GIVE US NO INFORMATION
HOLMES'S FACE SHOWED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT AND
ANNOYANCE
WELL WELL WE CAN'T EXPECT TO HAVE IT ALL OUR OWN WAY WATSON HE
SAID AT LAST
WE MUST COME BACK IN THE AFTERNOON IF MR
HARDING
WILL NOT BE HERE UNTIL THEN
I AM AS YOU HAVE NO DOUBT SURMISED
ENDEAVOURING TO TRACE THESE BUSTS TO THEIR SOURCE IN ORDER TO FIND IF
THERE IS NOT SOMETHING PECULIAR WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR REMARKABLE
FATE
LET US MAKE FOR MR
MORSE HUDSON OF THE KENNINGTON ROAD AND SEE
IF HE CAN THROW ANY LIGHT UPON THE PROBLEM
A DRIVE OF AN HOUR BROUGHT US TO THE PICTURE DEALER'S ESTABLISHMENT
HE
WAS A SMALL STOUT MAN WITH A RED FACE AND A PEPPERY MANNER
YES SIR
ON MY VERY COUNTER SIR SAID HE
WHAT WE PAY RATES AND
TAXES FOR I DON'T KNOW WHEN ANY RUFFIAN CAN COME IN AND BREAK ONE'S
GOODS
YES SIR IT WAS I WHO SOLD DR
BARNICOT HIS TWO STATUES
DISGRACEFUL SIR A NIHILIST PLOT THAT'S WHAT I MAKE IT
NO ONE BUT AN
ANARCHIST WOULD GO ABOUT BREAKING STATUES
RED REPUBLICANS THAT'S WHAT
I CALL 'EM
WHO DID I GET THE STATUES FROM I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO
DO WITH IT
WELL IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW I GOT THEM FROM GELDER
CO IN CHURCH STREET STEPNEY
THEY ARE A WELL KNOWN HOUSE IN THE
TRADE AND HAVE BEEN THIS TWENTY YEARS
HOW MANY HAD I THREE TWO AND
ONE ARE THREE TWO OF DR
BARNICOT'S AND ONE SMASHED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
ON MY OWN COUNTER
DO I KNOW THAT PHOTOGRAPH NO I DON'T
YES I DO
THOUGH
WHY IT'S BEPPO
HE WAS A KIND OF ITALIAN PIECE WORK MAN WHO
MADE HIMSELF USEFUL IN THE SHOP
HE COULD CARVE A BIT AND GILD AND
FRAME AND DO ODD JOBS
THE FELLOW LEFT ME LAST WEEK AND I'VE HEARD
NOTHING OF HIM SINCE
NO I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE CAME FROM NOR WHERE HE
WENT TO
I HAD NOTHING AGAINST HIM WHILE HE WAS HERE
HE WAS GONE TWO
DAYS BEFORE THE BUST WAS SMASHED
WELL THAT'S ALL WE COULD REASONABLY EXPECT FROM MORSE HUDSON SAID
HOLMES AS WE EMERGED FROM THE SHOP
WE HAVE THIS BEPPO AS A COMMON
FACTOR BOTH IN KENNINGTON AND IN KENSINGTON SO THAT IS WORTH A
TEN MILE DRIVE
NOW WATSON LET US MAKE FOR GELDER CO OF STEPNEY
THE SOURCE AND ORIGIN OF THE BUSTS
I SHALL BE SURPRISED IF WE DON'T GET
SOME HELP DOWN THERE
IN RAPID SUCCESSION WE PASSED THROUGH THE FRINGE OF FASHIONABLE LONDON
HOTEL LONDON THEATRICAL LONDON LITERARY LONDON COMMERCIAL LONDON
AND FINALLY MARITIME LONDON TILL WE CAME TO A RIVERSIDE CITY OF A
HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS WHERE THE TENEMENT HOUSES SWELTER AND REEK WITH
THE OUTCASTS OF EUROPE
HERE IN A BROAD THOROUGHFARE ONCE THE ABODE
OF WEALTHY CITY MERCHANTS WE FOUND THE SCULPTURE WORKS FOR WHICH WE
SEARCHED
OUTSIDE WAS A CONSIDERABLE YARD FULL OF MONUMENTAL MASONRY
INSIDE WAS A LARGE ROOM IN WHICH FIFTY WORKERS WERE CARVING OR MOULDING
THE MANAGER A BIG BLOND GERMAN RECEIVED US CIVILLY AND GAVE A CLEAR
ANSWER TO ALL HOLMES'S QUESTIONS
A REFERENCE TO HIS BOOKS SHOWED THAT
HUNDREDS OF CASTS HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM A MARBLE COPY OF DEVINE'S HEAD OF
NAPOLEON BUT THAT THE THREE WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO MORSE HUDSON A YEAR
OR SO BEFORE HAD BEEN HALF OF A BATCH OF SIX THE OTHER THREE BEING SENT
TO HARDING BROTHERS OF KENSINGTON
THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THOSE SIX
SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHER CASTS
HE COULD SUGGEST NO
POSSIBLE CAUSE WHY ANYONE SHOULD WISH TO DESTROY THEM IN FACT HE
LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
THEIR WHOLESALE PRICE WAS SIX SHILLINGS BUT THE
RETAILER WOULD GET TWELVE OR MORE
THE CAST WAS TAKEN IN TWO MOULDS FROM
EACH SIDE OF THE FACE AND THEN THESE TWO PROFILES OF PLASTER OF PARIS
WERE JOINED TOGETHER TO MAKE THE COMPLETE BUST
THE WORK WAS USUALLY
DONE BY ITALIANS IN THE ROOM WE WERE IN
WHEN FINISHED THE BUSTS WERE
PUT ON A TABLE IN THE PASSAGE TO DRY AND AFTERWARDS STORED
THAT WAS
ALL HE COULD TELL US
BUT THE PRODUCTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH HAD A REMARKABLE EFFECT UPON THE
MANAGER
HIS FACE FLUSHED WITH ANGER AND HIS BROWS KNOTTED OVER HIS
BLUE TEUTONIC EYES
AH THE RASCAL HE CRIED
YES INDEED I KNOW HIM VERY WELL
THIS HAS
ALWAYS BEEN A RESPECTABLE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE ONLY TIME THAT WE HAVE
EVER HAD THE POLICE IN IT WAS OVER THIS VERY FELLOW
IT WAS MORE THAN A
YEAR AGO NOW
HE KNIFED ANOTHER ITALIAN IN THE STREET AND THEN HE CAME
TO THE WORKS WITH THE POLICE ON HIS HEELS AND HE WAS TAKEN HERE
BEPPO
WAS HIS NAME HIS SECOND NAME I NEVER KNEW
SERVE ME RIGHT FOR ENGAGING
A MAN WITH SUCH A FACE
BUT HE WAS A GOOD WORKMAN ONE OF THE BEST
WHAT DID HE GET
THE MAN LIVED AND HE GOT OFF WITH A YEAR
I HAVE NO DOUBT HE IS OUT
NOW BUT HE HAS NOT DARED TO SHOW HIS NOSE HERE
WE HAVE A COUSIN OF HIS
HERE AND I DARESAY HE COULD TELL YOU WHERE HE IS
NO NO CRIED HOLMES NOT A WORD TO THE COUSIN NOT A WORD I BEG
OF YOU
THE MATTER IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THE FARTHER I GO WITH IT THE
MORE IMPORTANT IT SEEMS TO GROW
WHEN YOU REFERRED IN YOUR LEDGER TO THE
SALE OF THOSE CASTS I OBSERVED THAT THE DATE WAS JUNE 3RD OF LAST YEAR
COULD YOU GIVE ME THE DATE WHEN BEPPO WAS ARRESTED
I COULD TELL YOU ROUGHLY BY THE PAY LIST THE MANAGER ANSWERED
YES
HE CONTINUED AFTER SOME TURNING OVER OF PAGES HE WAS PAID LAST ON MAY
20TH
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES
I DON'T THINK THAT I NEED INTRUDE UPON YOUR
TIME AND PATIENCE ANY MORE WITH A LAST WORD OF CAUTION THAT HE SHOULD
SAY NOTHING AS TO OUR RESEARCHES WE TURNED OUR FACES WESTWARD ONCE
MORE
THE AFTERNOON WAS FAR ADVANCED BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO SNATCH A HASTY
LUNCHEON AT A RESTAURANT
A NEWS BILL AT THE ENTRANCE ANNOUNCED
KENSINGTON OUTRAGE
MURDER BY A MADMAN AND THE CONTENTS OF THE PAPER
SHOWED THAT MR
HORACE HARKER HAD GOT HIS ACCOUNT INTO PRINT AFTER
ALL
TWO COLUMNS WERE OCCUPIED WITH A HIGHLY SENSATIONAL AND FLOWERY
RENDERING OF THE WHOLE INCIDENT
HOLMES PROPPED IT AGAINST THE
CRUET STAND AND READ IT WHILE HE ATE
ONCE OR TWICE HE CHUCKLED
THIS IS ALL RIGHT WATSON SAID HE
LISTEN TO THIS
IT IS SATISFACTORY TO KNOW THAT THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION
UPON THIS CASE SINCE MR
LESTRADE ONE OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED
MEMBERS OF THE OFFICIAL FORCE AND MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES THE WELL KNOWN
CONSULTING EXPERT HAVE EACH COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE GROTESQUE
SERIES OF INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE ENDED IN SO TRAGIC A FASHION ARISE FROM
LUNACY RATHER THAN FROM DELIBERATE CRIME
NO EXPLANATION SAVE MENTAL
ABERRATION CAN COVER THE FACTS
THE PRESS WATSON IS A MOST VALUABLE INSTITUTION IF YOU ONLY KNOW HOW
TO USE IT
AND NOW IF YOU HAVE QUITE FINISHED WE WILL HARK BACK TO
KENSINGTON AND SEE WHAT THE MANAGER OF HARDING BROTHERS HAS TO SAY ON
THE MATTER
THE FOUNDER OF THAT GREAT EMPORIUM PROVED TO BE A BRISK CRISP LITTLE
PERSON VERY DAPPER AND QUICK WITH A CLEAR HEAD AND A READY TONGUE
YES SIR I HAVE ALREADY READ THE ACCOUNT IN THE EVENING PAPERS
MR
HORACE HARKER IS A CUSTOMER OF OURS
WE SUPPLIED HIM WITH THE BUST SOME
MONTHS AGO
WE ORDERED THREE BUSTS OF THAT SORT FROM GELDER CO OF
STEPNEY
THEY ARE ALL SOLD NOW
TO WHOM OH I DARESAY BY CONSULTING OUR
SALES BOOK WE COULD VERY EASILY TELL YOU
YES WE HAVE THE ENTRIES HERE
ONE TO MR
HARKER YOU SEE AND ONE TO MR
JOSIAH BROWN OF LABURNUM
LODGE LABURNUM VALE CHISWICK AND ONE TO MR
SANDEFORD OF LOWER GROVE
ROAD READING
NO I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS FACE WHICH YOU SHOW ME IN THE
PHOTOGRAPH
YOU WOULD HARDLY FORGET IT WOULD YOU SIR FOR I'VE SELDOM
SEEN AN UGLIER
HAVE WE ANY ITALIANS ON THE STAFF YES SIR WE HAVE
SEVERAL AMONG OUR WORKPEOPLE AND CLEANERS
I DARESAY THEY MIGHT GET A
PEEP AT THAT SALES BOOK IF THEY WANTED TO
THERE IS NO PARTICULAR REASON
FOR KEEPING A WATCH UPON THAT BOOK
WELL WELL IT'S A VERY STRANGE
BUSINESS AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LET ME KNOW IF ANYTHING COMES OF YOUR
INQUIRIES
HOLMES HAD TAKEN SEVERAL NOTES DURING MR
HARDING'S EVIDENCE AND I
COULD SEE THAT HE WAS THOROUGHLY SATISFIED BY THE TURN WHICH AFFAIRS
WERE TAKING
HE MADE NO REMARK HOWEVER SAVE THAT UNLESS WE HURRIED
WE SHOULD BE LATE FOR OUR APPOINTMENT WITH LESTRADE
SURE ENOUGH WHEN
WE REACHED BAKER STREET THE DETECTIVE WAS ALREADY THERE AND WE FOUND
HIM PACING UP AND DOWN IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE
HIS LOOK OF IMPORTANCE
SHOWED THAT HIS DAY'S WORK HAD NOT BEEN IN VAIN
WELL HE ASKED
WHAT LUCK MR
HOLMES
WE HAVE HAD A VERY BUSY DAY AND NOT ENTIRELY A WASTED ONE MY FRIEND
EXPLAINED
WE HAVE SEEN BOTH THE RETAILERS AND ALSO THE WHOLESALE
MANUFACTURERS
I CAN TRACE EACH OF THE BUSTS NOW FROM THE BEGINNING
THE BUSTS CRIED LESTRADE
WELL WELL YOU HAVE YOUR OWN METHODS MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND IT IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY A WORD AGAINST THEM BUT
I THINK I HAVE DONE A BETTER DAY'S WORK THAN YOU
I HAVE IDENTIFIED THE
DEAD MAN
YOU DON'T SAY SO
AND FOUND A CAUSE FOR THE CRIME
SPLENDID
WE HAVE AN INSPECTOR WHO MAKES A SPECIALTY OF SAFFRON HILL AND THE
ITALIAN QUARTER
WELL THIS DEAD MAN HAD SOME CATHOLIC EMBLEM ROUND HIS
NECK AND THAT ALONG WITH HIS COLOUR MADE ME THINK HE WAS FROM THE
SOUTH
INSPECTOR HILL KNEW HIM THE MOMENT HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM
HIS
NAME IS PIETRO VENUCCI FROM NAPLES AND HE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST
CUT THROATS IN LONDON
HE IS CONNECTED WITH THE MAFIA WHICH AS YOU
KNOW IS A SECRET POLITICAL SOCIETY ENFORCING ITS DECREES BY MURDER
NOW YOU SEE HOW THE AFFAIR BEGINS TO CLEAR UP
THE OTHER FELLOW IS
PROBABLY AN ITALIAN ALSO AND A MEMBER OF THE MAFIA
HE HAS BROKEN
THE RULES IN SOME FASHION
PIETRO IS SET UPON HIS TRACK
PROBABLY THE
PHOTOGRAPH WE FOUND IN HIS POCKET IS THE MAN HIMSELF SO THAT HE MAY NOT
KNIFE THE WRONG PERSON
HE DOGS THE FELLOW HE SEES HIM ENTER A HOUSE
HE WAITS OUTSIDE FOR HIM AND IN THE SCUFFLE HE RECEIVES HIS OWN
DEATH WOUND
HOW IS THAT MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
HOLMES CLAPPED HIS HANDS APPROVINGLY
EXCELLENT LESTRADE EXCELLENT HE CRIED
BUT I DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW
YOUR EXPLANATION OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BUSTS
THE BUSTS YOU NEVER CAN GET THOSE BUSTS OUT OF YOUR HEAD
AFTER ALL
THAT IS NOTHING PETTY LARCENY SIX MONTHS AT THE MOST
IT IS THE MURDER
THAT WE ARE REALLY INVESTIGATING AND I TELL YOU THAT I AM GATHERING ALL
THE THREADS INTO MY HANDS
AND THE NEXT STAGE
IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE
I SHALL GO DOWN WITH HILL TO THE ITALIAN QUARTER
FIND THE MAN WHOSE PHOTOGRAPH WE HAVE GOT AND ARREST HIM ON THE CHARGE
OF MURDER
WILL YOU COME WITH US
I THINK NOT
I FANCY WE CAN ATTAIN OUR END IN A SIMPLER WAY
I CAN'T
SAY FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE IT ALL DEPENDS WELL IT ALL DEPENDS UPON
A FACTOR WHICH IS COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL
BUT I HAVE GREAT
HOPES IN FACT THE BETTING IS EXACTLY TWO TO ONE THAT IF YOU WILL COME
WITH US TO NIGHT I SHALL BE ABLE TO HELP YOU TO LAY HIM BY THE HEELS
IN THE ITALIAN QUARTER
NO I FANCY CHISWICK IS AN ADDRESS WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO FIND HIM
IF
YOU WILL COME WITH ME TO CHISWICK TO NIGHT LESTRADE I'LL PROMISE TO GO
TO THE ITALIAN QUARTER WITH YOU TO MORROW AND NO HARM WILL BE DONE BY
THE DELAY
AND NOW I THINK THAT A FEW HOURS' SLEEP WOULD DO US ALL GOOD
FOR I DO NOT PROPOSE TO LEAVE BEFORE ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND IT IS UNLIKELY
THAT WE SHALL BE BACK BEFORE MORNING
YOU'LL DINE WITH US LESTRADE AND
THEN YOU ARE WELCOME TO THE SOFA UNTIL IT IS TIME FOR US TO START
IN
THE MEANTIME WATSON I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU WOULD RING FOR AN EXPRESS
MESSENGER FOR I HAVE A LETTER TO SEND AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT IT
SHOULD GO AT ONCE
HOLMES SPENT THE EVENING IN RUMMAGING AMONG THE FILES OF THE OLD DAILY
PAPERS WITH WHICH ONE OF OUR LUMBER ROOMS WAS PACKED
WHEN AT LAST
HE DESCENDED IT WAS WITH TRIUMPH IN HIS EYES BUT HE SAID NOTHING TO
EITHER OF US AS TO THE RESULT OF HIS RESEARCHES
FOR MY OWN PART I HAD
FOLLOWED STEP BY STEP THE METHODS BY WHICH HE HAD TRACED THE VARIOUS
WINDINGS OF THIS COMPLEX CASE AND THOUGH I COULD NOT YET PERCEIVE THE
GOAL WHICH WE WOULD REACH I UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY THAT HOLMES EXPECTED
THIS GROTESQUE CRIMINAL TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT UPON THE TWO REMAINING BUSTS
ONE OF WHICH I REMEMBERED WAS AT CHISWICK
NO DOUBT THE OBJECT OF OUR
JOURNEY WAS TO CATCH HIM IN THE VERY ACT AND I COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE THE
CUNNING WITH WHICH MY FRIEND HAD INSERTED A WRONG CLUE IN THE EVENING
PAPER SO AS TO GIVE THE FELLOW THE IDEA THAT HE COULD CONTINUE HIS
SCHEME WITH IMPUNITY
I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN HOLMES SUGGESTED THAT
I SHOULD TAKE MY REVOLVER WITH ME
HE HAD HIMSELF PICKED UP THE LOADED
HUNTING CROP WHICH WAS HIS FAVOURITE WEAPON
A FOUR WHEELER WAS AT THE DOOR AT ELEVEN AND IN IT WE DROVE TO A SPOT
AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HAMMERSMITH BRIDGE
HERE THE CABMAN WAS DIRECTED TO
WAIT
A SHORT WALK BROUGHT US TO A SECLUDED ROAD FRINGED WITH PLEASANT
HOUSES EACH STANDING IN ITS OWN GROUNDS
IN THE LIGHT OF A STREET
LAMP WE READ LABURNUM VILLA UPON THE GATE POST OF ONE OF THEM
THE
OCCUPANTS HAD EVIDENTLY RETIRED TO REST FOR ALL WAS DARK SAVE FOR A
FANLIGHT OVER THE HALL DOOR WHICH SHED A SINGLE BLURRED CIRCLE ON TO
THE GARDEN PATH
THE WOODEN FENCE WHICH SEPARATED THE GROUNDS FROM THE
ROAD THREW A DENSE BLACK SHADOW UPON THE INNER SIDE AND HERE IT WAS
THAT WE CROUCHED
I FEAR THAT YOU'LL HAVE A LONG WAIT HOLMES WHISPERED
WE MAY THANK
OUR STARS THAT IT IS NOT RAINING
I DON'T THINK WE CAN EVEN VENTURE TO
SMOKE TO PASS THE TIME
HOWEVER IT'S A TWO TO ONE CHANCE THAT WE GET
SOMETHING TO PAY US FOR OUR TROUBLE
IT PROVED HOWEVER THAT OUR VIGIL WAS NOT TO BE SO LONG AS HOLMES HAD
LED US TO FEAR AND IT ENDED IN A VERY SUDDEN AND SINGULAR FASHION
IN
AN INSTANT WITHOUT THE LEAST SOUND TO WARN US OF HIS COMING THE GARDEN
GATE SWUNG OPEN AND A LITHE DARK FIGURE AS SWIFT AND ACTIVE AS AN
APE RUSHED UP THE GARDEN PATH
WE SAW IT WHISK PAST THE LIGHT THROWN
FROM OVER THE DOOR AND DISAPPEAR AGAINST THE BLACK SHADOW OF THE HOUSE
THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE DURING WHICH WE HELD OUR BREATH AND THEN A VERY
GENTLE CREAKING SOUND CAME TO OUR EARS
THE WINDOW WAS BEING OPENED
THE
NOISE CEASED AND AGAIN THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
THE FELLOW WAS MAKING
HIS WAY INTO THE HOUSE
WE SAW THE SUDDEN FLASH OF A DARK LANTERN INSIDE
THE ROOM
WHAT HE SOUGHT WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THERE FOR AGAIN WE SAW THE
FLASH THROUGH ANOTHER BLIND AND THEN THROUGH ANOTHER
LET US GET TO THE OPEN WINDOW
WE WILL NAB HIM AS HE CLIMBS OUT
LESTRADE WHISPERED
BUT BEFORE WE COULD MOVE THE MAN HAD EMERGED AGAIN
AS HE CAME OUT INTO
THE GLIMMERING PATCH OF LIGHT WE SAW THAT HE CARRIED SOMETHING WHITE
UNDER HIS ARM
HE LOOKED STEALTHILY ALL ROUND HIM
THE SILENCE OF THE
DESERTED STREET REASSURED HIM
TURNING HIS BACK UPON US HE LAID DOWN
HIS BURDEN AND THE NEXT INSTANT THERE WAS THE SOUND OF A SHARP TAP
FOLLOWED BY A CLATTER AND RATTLE
THE MAN WAS SO INTENT UPON WHAT HE WAS
DOING THAT HE NEVER HEARD OUR STEPS AS WE STOLE ACROSS THE GRASS PLOT
WITH THE BOUND OF A TIGER HOLMES WAS ON HIS BACK AND AN INSTANT LATER
LESTRADE AND I HAD HIM BY EITHER WRIST AND THE HANDCUFFS HAD BEEN
FASTENED
AS WE TURNED HIM OVER I SAW A HIDEOUS SALLOW FACE WITH
WRITHING FURIOUS FEATURES GLARING UP AT US AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS
INDEED THE MAN OF THE PHOTOGRAPH WHOM WE HAD SECURED
BUT IT WAS NOT OUR PRISONER TO WHOM HOLMES WAS GIVING HIS ATTENTION
SQUATTED ON THE DOORSTEP HE WAS ENGAGED IN MOST CAREFULLY EXAMINING
THAT WHICH THE MAN HAD BROUGHT FROM THE HOUSE
IT WAS A BUST OF
NAPOLEON LIKE THE ONE WHICH WE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING AND IT HAD BEEN
BROKEN INTO SIMILAR FRAGMENTS
CAREFULLY HOLMES HELD EACH SEPARATE SHARD
TO THE LIGHT BUT IN NO WAY DID IT DIFFER FROM ANY OTHER SHATTERED PIECE
OF PLASTER
HE HAD JUST COMPLETED HIS EXAMINATION WHEN THE HALL LIGHTS
FLEW UP THE DOOR OPENED AND THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE A JOVIAL ROTUND
FIGURE IN SHIRT AND TROUSERS PRESENTED HIMSELF
MR
JOSIAH BROWN I SUPPOSE SAID HOLMES
YES SIR AND YOU NO DOUBT ARE MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES I HAD THE NOTE
WHICH YOU SENT BY THE EXPRESS MESSENGER AND I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU TOLD
ME
WE LOCKED EVERY DOOR ON THE INSIDE AND AWAITED DEVELOPMENTS
WELL
I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE GOT THE RASCAL
I HOPE GENTLEMEN
THAT YOU WILL COME IN AND HAVE SOME REFRESHMENT
HOWEVER LESTRADE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET HIS MAN INTO SAFE QUARTERS SO
WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OUR CAB HAD BEEN SUMMONED AND WE WERE ALL FOUR UPON
OUR WAY TO LONDON
NOT A WORD WOULD OUR CAPTIVE SAY BUT HE GLARED AT US
FROM THE SHADOW OF HIS MATTED HAIR AND ONCE WHEN MY HAND SEEMED WITHIN
HIS REACH HE SNAPPED AT IT LIKE A HUNGRY WOLF
WE STAYED LONG ENOUGH
AT THE POLICE STATION TO LEARN THAT A SEARCH OF HIS CLOTHING REVEALED
NOTHING SAVE A FEW SHILLINGS AND A LONG SHEATH KNIFE THE HANDLE OF
WHICH BORE COPIOUS TRACES OF RECENT BLOOD
THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID LESTRADE AS WE PARTED
HILL KNOWS ALL THESE
GENTRY AND HE WILL GIVE A NAME TO HIM
YOU'LL FIND THAT MY THEORY OF
THE MAFIA WILL WORK OUT ALL RIGHT
BUT I'M SURE I AM EXCEEDINGLY OBLIGED
TO YOU MR
HOLMES FOR THE WORKMANLIKE WAY IN WHICH YOU LAID HANDS UPON
HIM
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT ALL YET
I FEAR IT IS RATHER TOO LATE AN HOUR FOR EXPLANATIONS SAID HOLMES
BESIDES THERE ARE ONE OR TWO DETAILS WHICH ARE NOT FINISHED OFF AND
IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHICH ARE WORTH WORKING OUT TO THE VERY END
IF YOU WILL COME ROUND ONCE MORE TO MY ROOMS AT SIX O'CLOCK TO MORROW I
THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU THAT EVEN NOW YOU HAVE NOT GRASPED THE
ENTIRE MEANING OF THIS BUSINESS WHICH PRESENTS SOME FEATURES WHICH MAKE
IT ABSOLUTELY ORIGINAL IN THE HISTORY OF CRIME
IF EVER I PERMIT YOU
TO CHRONICLE ANY MORE OF MY LITTLE PROBLEMS WATSON I FORESEE THAT YOU
WILL ENLIVEN YOUR PAGES BY AN ACCOUNT OF THE SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF THE
NAPOLEONIC BUSTS
WHEN WE MET AGAIN NEXT EVENING LESTRADE WAS FURNISHED WITH MUCH
INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR PRISONER
HIS NAME IT APPEARED WAS BEPPO
SECOND NAME UNKNOWN
HE WAS A WELL KNOWN NE'ER DO WELL AMONG THE ITALIAN
COLONY
HE HAD ONCE BEEN A SKILFUL SCULPTOR AND HAD EARNED AN HONEST
LIVING BUT HE HAD TAKEN TO EVIL COURSES AND HAD TWICE ALREADY BEEN IN
JAIL ONCE FOR A PETTY THEFT AND ONCE AS WE HAD ALREADY HEARD FOR
STABBING A FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
HE COULD TALK ENGLISH PERFECTLY WELL
HIS
REASONS FOR DESTROYING THE BUSTS WERE STILL UNKNOWN AND HE REFUSED TO
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS UPON THE SUBJECT BUT THE POLICE HAD DISCOVERED
THAT THESE SAME BUSTS MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN MADE BY HIS OWN HANDS
SINCE HE WAS ENGAGED IN THIS CLASS OF WORK AT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
GELDER CO
TO ALL THIS INFORMATION MUCH OF WHICH WE ALREADY KNEW
HOLMES LISTENED WITH POLITE ATTENTION BUT I WHO KNEW HIM SO WELL
COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT HIS THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE AND I DETECTED A
MIXTURE OF MINGLED UNEASINESS AND EXPECTATION BENEATH THAT MASK WHICH
HE WAS WONT TO ASSUME
AT LAST HE STARTED IN HIS CHAIR AND HIS EYES
BRIGHTENED
THERE HAD BEEN A RING AT THE BELL
A MINUTE LATER WE HEARD
STEPS UPON THE STAIRS AND AN ELDERLY RED FACED MAN WITH GRIZZLED
SIDE WHISKERS WAS USHERED IN
IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE CARRIED AN
OLD FASHIONED CARPET BAG WHICH HE PLACED UPON THE TABLE
IS MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES HERE
MY FRIEND BOWED AND SMILED
MR
SANDEFORD OF READING I SUPPOSE SAID
HE
YES SIR I FEAR THAT I AM A LITTLE LATE BUT THE TRAINS WERE AWKWARD
YOU WROTE TO ME ABOUT A BUST THAT IS IN MY POSSESSION
EXACTLY
I HAVE YOUR LETTER HERE
YOU SAID 'I DESIRE TO POSSESS A COPY OF
DEVINE'S NAPOLEON AND AM PREPARED TO PAY YOU TEN POUNDS FOR THE ONE
WHICH IS IN YOUR POSSESSION IS THAT RIGHT
CERTAINLY
I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AT YOUR LETTER FOR I COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW
YOU KNEW THAT I OWNED SUCH A THING
OF COURSE YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BUT THE EXPLANATION IS VERY
SIMPLE
MR
HARDING OF HARDING BROTHERS SAID THAT THEY HAD SOLD YOU
THEIR LAST COPY AND HE GAVE ME YOUR ADDRESS
OH THAT WAS IT WAS IT DID HE TELL YOU WHAT I PAID FOR IT
NO HE DID NOT
WELL I AM AN HONEST MAN THOUGH NOT A VERY RICH ONE
I ONLY GAVE
FIFTEEN SHILLINGS FOR THE BUST AND I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT
BEFORE I TAKE TEN POUNDS FROM YOU
I AM SURE THE SCRUPLE DOES YOU HONOUR MR
SANDEFORD
BUT I HAVE NAMED
THAT PRICE SO I INTEND TO STICK TO IT
WELL IT IS VERY HANDSOME OF YOU MR
HOLMES
I BROUGHT THE BUST UP
WITH ME AS YOU ASKED ME TO DO
HERE IT IS HE OPENED HIS BAG AND AT
LAST WE SAW PLACED UPON OUR TABLE A COMPLETE SPECIMEN OF THAT BUST WHICH
WE HAD ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN ONCE IN FRAGMENTS
HOLMES TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND LAID A TEN POUND NOTE UPON THE
TABLE
YOU WILL KINDLY SIGN THAT PAPER MR
SANDEFORD IN THE PRESENCE OF
THESE WITNESSES
IT IS SIMPLY TO SAY THAT YOU TRANSFER EVERY POSSIBLE
RIGHT THAT YOU EVER HAD IN THE BUST TO ME
I AM A METHODICAL MAN YOU
SEE AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TURN EVENTS MIGHT TAKE AFTERWARDS
THANK
YOU MR
SANDEFORD HERE IS YOUR MONEY AND I WISH YOU A VERY GOOD
EVENING
WHEN OUR VISITOR HAD DISAPPEARED SHERLOCK HOLMES'S MOVEMENTS WERE SUCH
AS TO RIVET OUR ATTENTION
HE BEGAN BY TAKING A CLEAN WHITE CLOTH FROM
A DRAWER AND LAYING IT OVER THE TABLE
THEN HE PLACED HIS NEWLY ACQUIRED
BUST IN THE CENTRE OF THE CLOTH
FINALLY HE PICKED UP HIS HUNTING CROP
AND STRUCK NAPOLEON A SHARP BLOW ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD
THE FIGURE
BROKE INTO FRAGMENTS AND HOLMES BENT EAGERLY OVER THE SHATTERED
REMAINS
NEXT INSTANT WITH A LOUD SHOUT OF TRIUMPH HE HELD UP ONE
SPLINTER IN WHICH A ROUND DARK OBJECT WAS FIXED LIKE A PLUM IN A
PUDDING
GENTLEMEN HE CRIED LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO THE FAMOUS BLACK PEARL
OF THE BORGIAS
LESTRADE AND I SAT SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN WITH A SPONTANEOUS
IMPULSE WE BOTH BROKE AT CLAPPING AS AT THE WELL WROUGHT CRISIS OF A
PLAY
A FLUSH OF COLOUR SPRANG TO HOLMES'S PALE CHEEKS AND HE BOWED TO
US LIKE THE MASTER DRAMATIST WHO RECEIVES THE HOMAGE OF HIS AUDIENCE
IT WAS AT SUCH MOMENTS THAT FOR AN INSTANT HE CEASED TO BE A REASONING
MACHINE AND BETRAYED HIS HUMAN LOVE FOR ADMIRATION AND APPLAUSE
THE
SAME SINGULARLY PROUD AND RESERVED NATURE WHICH TURNED AWAY WITH DISDAIN
FROM POPULAR NOTORIETY WAS CAPABLE OF BEING MOVED TO ITS DEPTHS BY
SPONTANEOUS WONDER AND PRAISE FROM A FRIEND
YES GENTLEMEN SAID HE IT IS THE MOST FAMOUS PEARL NOW EXISTING
IN THE WORLD AND IT HAS BEEN MY GOOD FORTUNE BY A CONNECTED CHAIN OF
INDUCTIVE REASONING TO TRACE IT FROM THE PRINCE OF COLONNA'S BEDROOM AT
THE DACRE HOTEL WHERE IT WAS LOST TO THE INTERIOR OF THIS THE LAST
OF THE SIX BUSTS OF NAPOLEON WHICH WERE MANUFACTURED BY GELDER CO
OF STEPNEY
YOU WILL REMEMBER LESTRADE THE SENSATION CAUSED BY THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS VALUABLE JEWEL AND THE VAIN EFFORTS OF THE LONDON
POLICE TO RECOVER IT
I WAS MYSELF CONSULTED UPON THE CASE BUT I WAS
UNABLE TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON IT
SUSPICION FELL UPON THE MAID OF THE
PRINCESS WHO WAS AN ITALIAN AND IT WAS PROVED THAT SHE HAD A BROTHER
IN LONDON BUT WE FAILED TO TRACE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM
THE
MAID'S NAME WAS LUCRETIA VENUCCI AND THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT
THIS PIETRO WHO WAS MURDERED TWO NIGHTS AGO WAS THE BROTHER
I HAVE BEEN
LOOKING UP THE DATES IN THE OLD FILES OF THE PAPER AND I FIND THAT THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE PEARL WAS EXACTLY TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST OF
BEPPO FOR SOME CRIME OF VIOLENCE AN EVENT WHICH TOOK PLACE IN THE
FACTORY OF GELDER CO AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE BUSTS WERE BEING
MADE
NOW YOU CLEARLY SEE THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THOUGH YOU SEE THEM
OF COURSE IN THE INVERSE ORDER TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY PRESENTED
THEMSELVES TO ME
BEPPO HAD THE PEARL IN HIS POSSESSION
HE MAY HAVE
STOLEN IT FROM PIETRO HE MAY HAVE BEEN PIETRO'S CONFEDERATE HE
MAY HAVE BEEN THE GO BETWEEN OF PIETRO AND HIS SISTER
IT IS OF NO
CONSEQUENCE TO US WHICH IS THE CORRECT SOLUTION
THE MAIN FACT IS THAT HE HAD THE PEARL AND AT THAT MOMENT WHEN IT WAS
ON HIS PERSON HE WAS PURSUED BY THE POLICE
HE MADE FOR THE FACTORY IN
WHICH HE WORKED AND HE KNEW THAT HE HAD ONLY A FEW MINUTES IN WHICH TO
CONCEAL THIS ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE PRIZE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE FOUND
ON HIM WHEN HE WAS SEARCHED
SIX PLASTER CASTS OF NAPOLEON WERE DRYING
IN THE PASSAGE
ONE OF THEM WAS STILL SOFT
IN AN INSTANT BEPPO A
SKILFUL WORKMAN MADE A SMALL HOLE IN THE WET PLASTER DROPPED IN THE
PEARL AND WITH A FEW TOUCHES COVERED OVER THE APERTURE ONCE MORE
IT
WAS AN ADMIRABLE HIDING PLACE
NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY FIND IT
BUT BEPPO
WAS CONDEMNED TO A YEAR'S IMPRISONMENT AND IN THE MEANWHILE HIS SIX
BUSTS WERE SCATTERED OVER LONDON
HE COULD NOT TELL WHICH CONTAINED HIS
TREASURE
ONLY BY BREAKING THEM COULD HE SEE
EVEN SHAKING WOULD TELL
HIM NOTHING FOR AS THE PLASTER WAS WET IT WAS PROBABLE THAT THE PEARL
WOULD ADHERE TO IT AS IN FACT IT HAS DONE
BEPPO DID NOT DESPAIR AND
HE CONDUCTED HIS SEARCH WITH CONSIDERABLE INGENUITY AND PERSEVERANCE
THROUGH A COUSIN WHO WORKS WITH GELDER HE FOUND OUT THE RETAIL FIRMS
WHO HAD BOUGHT THE BUSTS
HE MANAGED TO FIND EMPLOYMENT WITH MORSE
HUDSON AND IN THAT WAY TRACKED DOWN THREE OF THEM
THE PEARL WAS NOT
THERE
THEN WITH THE HELP OF SOME ITALIAN EMPLOYEE HE SUCCEEDED IN
FINDING OUT WHERE THE OTHER THREE BUSTS HAD GONE
THE FIRST WAS AT
HARKER'S
THERE HE WAS DOGGED BY HIS CONFEDERATE WHO HELD BEPPO
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF THE PEARL AND HE STABBED HIM IN THE SCUFFLE
WHICH FOLLOWED
IF HE WAS HIS CONFEDERATE WHY SHOULD HE CARRY HIS PHOTOGRAPH I
ASKED
AS A MEANS OF TRACING HIM IF HE WISHED TO INQUIRE ABOUT HIM FROM ANY
THIRD PERSON
THAT WAS THE OBVIOUS REASON
WELL AFTER THE MURDER
I CALCULATED THAT BEPPO WOULD PROBABLY HURRY RATHER THAN DELAY HIS
MOVEMENTS
HE WOULD FEAR THAT THE POLICE WOULD READ HIS SECRET AND SO
HE HASTENED ON BEFORE THEY SHOULD GET AHEAD OF HIM
OF COURSE I COULD
NOT SAY THAT HE HAD NOT FOUND THE PEARL IN HARKER'S BUST
I HAD NOT EVEN
CONCLUDED FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS THE PEARL BUT IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME
THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SINCE HE CARRIED THE BUST PAST
THE OTHER HOUSES IN ORDER TO BREAK IT IN THE GARDEN WHICH HAD A LAMP
OVERLOOKING IT
SINCE HARKER'S BUST WAS ONE IN THREE THE CHANCES WERE
EXACTLY AS I TOLD YOU TWO TO ONE AGAINST THE PEARL BEING INSIDE IT
THERE REMAINED TWO BUSTS AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WOULD GO FOR THE
LONDON ONE FIRST
I WARNED THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE SO AS TO AVOID A
SECOND TRAGEDY AND WE WENT DOWN WITH THE HAPPIEST RESULTS
BY THAT
TIME OF COURSE I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS THE BORGIA PEARL THAT WE
WERE AFTER
THE NAME OF THE MURDERED MAN LINKED THE ONE EVENT WITH THE
OTHER
THERE ONLY REMAINED A SINGLE BUST THE READING ONE AND THE PEARL
MUST BE THERE
I BOUGHT IT IN YOUR PRESENCE FROM THE OWNER AND THERE IT
LIES
WE SAT IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
WELL SAID LESTRADE I'VE SEEN YOU HANDLE A GOOD MANY CASES MR
HOLMES BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER KNEW A MORE WORKMANLIKE ONE THAN
THAT
WE'RE NOT JEALOUS OF YOU AT SCOTLAND YARD
NO SIR WE ARE VERY
PROUD OF YOU AND IF YOU COME DOWN TO MORROW THERE'S NOT A MAN FROM
THE OLDEST INSPECTOR TO THE YOUNGEST CONSTABLE WHO WOULDN'T BE GLAD TO
SHAKE YOU BY THE HAND
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES
THANK YOU AND AS HE TURNED AWAY IT SEEMED
TO ME THAT HE WAS MORE NEARLY MOVED BY THE SOFTER HUMAN EMOTIONS THAN I
HAD EVER SEEN HIM
A MOMENT LATER HE WAS THE COLD AND PRACTICAL THINKER
ONCE MORE
PUT THE PEARL IN THE SAFE WATSON SAID HE AND GET OUT
THE PAPERS OF THE CONK SINGLETON FORGERY CASE
GOOD BYE LESTRADE
IF
ANY LITTLE PROBLEM COMES YOUR WAY I SHALL BE HAPPY IF I CAN TO GIVE
YOU A HINT OR TWO AS TO ITS SOLUTION
THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS
IT WAS IN THE YEAR '95 THAT A COMBINATION OF EVENTS INTO WHICH I NEED
NOT ENTER CAUSED MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND MYSELF TO SPEND SOME WEEKS IN
ONE OF OUR GREAT UNIVERSITY TOWNS AND IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THAT THE
SMALL BUT INSTRUCTIVE ADVENTURE WHICH I AM ABOUT TO RELATE BEFELL US
IT
WILL BE OBVIOUS THAT ANY DETAILS WHICH WOULD HELP THE READER EXACTLY TO
IDENTIFY THE COLLEGE OR THE CRIMINAL WOULD BE INJUDICIOUS AND OFFENSIVE
SO PAINFUL A SCANDAL MAY WELL BE ALLOWED TO DIE OUT
WITH DUE DISCRETION
THE INCIDENT ITSELF MAY HOWEVER BE DESCRIBED SINCE IT SERVES TO
ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THOSE QUALITIES FOR WHICH MY FRIEND WAS REMARKABLE
I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE
TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE
PEOPLE CONCERNED
WE WERE RESIDING AT THE TIME IN FURNISHED LODGINGS CLOSE TO A LIBRARY
WHERE SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS PURSUING SOME LABORIOUS RESEARCHES IN EARLY
ENGLISH CHARTERS RESEARCHES WHICH LED TO RESULTS SO STRIKING THAT THEY
MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF ONE OF MY FUTURE NARRATIVES
HERE IT WAS THAT ONE
EVENING WE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM AN ACQUAINTANCE MR
HILTON SOAMES
TUTOR AND LECTURER AT THE COLLEGE OF ST
LUKE'S
MR
SOAMES WAS A TALL
SPARE MAN OF A NERVOUS AND EXCITABLE TEMPERAMENT
I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN
HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS
IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING
VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
I TRUST MR
HOLMES THAT YOU CAN SPARE ME A FEW HOURS OF YOUR VALUABLE
TIME
WE HAVE HAD A VERY PAINFUL INCIDENT AT ST
LUKE'S AND REALLY BUT
FOR THE HAPPY CHANCE OF YOUR BEING IN TOWN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT A LOSS
WHAT TO DO
I AM VERY BUSY JUST NOW AND I DESIRE NO DISTRACTIONS MY FRIEND
ANSWERED
I SHOULD MUCH PREFER THAT YOU CALLED IN THE AID OF THE
POLICE
NO NO MY DEAR SIR SUCH A COURSE IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE
WHEN ONCE THE
LAW IS EVOKED IT CANNOT BE STAYED AGAIN AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE
CASES WHERE FOR THE CREDIT OF THE COLLEGE IT IS MOST ESSENTIAL TO
AVOID SCANDAL
YOUR DISCRETION IS AS WELL KNOWN AS YOUR POWERS AND YOU
ARE THE ONE MAN IN THE WORLD WHO CAN HELP ME
I BEG YOU MR
HOLMES TO
DO WHAT YOU CAN
MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE
CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET
WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS
CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
HE
SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN UNGRACIOUS ACQUIESCENCE WHILE OUR VISITOR
IN HURRIED WORDS AND WITH MUCH EXCITABLE GESTICULATION POURED FORTH HIS
STORY
I MUST EXPLAIN TO YOU MR
HOLMES THAT TO MORROW IS THE FIRST DAY
OF THE EXAMINATION FOR THE FORTESCUE SCHOLARSHIP
I AM ONE OF THE
EXAMINERS
MY SUBJECT IS GREEK AND THE FIRST OF THE PAPERS CONSISTS OF
A LARGE PASSAGE OF GREEK TRANSLATION WHICH THE CANDIDATE HAS NOT SEEN
THIS PASSAGE IS PRINTED ON THE EXAMINATION PAPER AND IT WOULD NATURALLY
BE AN IMMENSE ADVANTAGE IF THE CANDIDATE COULD PREPARE IT IN ADVANCE
FOR THIS REASON GREAT CARE IS TAKEN TO KEEP THE PAPER SECRET
TO DAY ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THE PROOFS OF THIS PAPER ARRIVED FROM THE
PRINTERS
THE EXERCISE CONSISTS OF HALF A CHAPTER OF THUCYDIDES
I HAD
TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
AT
FOUR THIRTY MY TASK WAS NOT YET COMPLETED
I HAD HOWEVER PROMISED TO
TAKE TEA IN A FRIEND'S ROOMS SO I LEFT THE PROOF UPON MY DESK
I WAS
ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
YOU ARE AWARE MR
HOLMES THAT OUR COLLEGE DOORS ARE DOUBLE A GREEN
BAIZE ONE WITHIN AND A HEAVY OAK ONE WITHOUT
AS I APPROACHED MY OUTER
DOOR I WAS AMAZED TO SEE A KEY IN IT
FOR AN INSTANT I IMAGINED THAT I
HAD LEFT MY OWN THERE BUT ON FEELING IN MY POCKET I FOUND THAT IT WAS
ALL RIGHT
THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT
WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY
ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
I
FOUND THAT THE KEY WAS INDEED HIS THAT HE HAD ENTERED MY ROOM TO KNOW
IF I WANTED TEA AND THAT HE HAD VERY CARELESSLY LEFT THE KEY IN THE
DOOR WHEN HE CAME OUT
HIS VISIT TO MY ROOM MUST HAVE BEEN WITHIN A VERY
FEW MINUTES OF MY LEAVING IT
HIS FORGETFULNESS ABOUT THE KEY WOULD
HAVE MATTERED LITTLE UPON ANY OTHER OCCASION BUT ON THIS ONE DAY IT HAS
PRODUCED THE MOST DEPLORABLE CONSEQUENCES
THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED
AMONG MY PAPERS
THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS
I HAD LEFT THEM ALL
TOGETHER
NOW I FOUND THAT ONE OF THEM WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR ONE WAS
ON THE SIDE TABLE NEAR THE WINDOW AND THE THIRD WAS WHERE I HAD LEFT
IT
HOLMES STIRRED FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE FIRST PAGE ON THE FLOOR THE SECOND IN THE WINDOW THE THIRD WHERE
YOU LEFT IT SAID HE
EXACTLY MR
HOLMES
YOU AMAZE ME
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY KNOW THAT
PRAY CONTINUE YOUR VERY INTERESTING STATEMENT
FOR AN INSTANT I IMAGINED THAT BANNISTER HAD TAKEN THE UNPARDONABLE
LIBERTY OF EXAMINING MY PAPERS
HE DENIED IT HOWEVER WITH THE UTMOST
EARNESTNESS AND I AM CONVINCED THAT HE WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH
THE
ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
A LARGE
SUM OF MONEY IS AT STAKE FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP IS A VERY VALUABLE ONE
AND AN UNSCRUPULOUS MAN MIGHT VERY WELL RUN A RISK IN ORDER TO GAIN AN
ADVANTAGE OVER HIS FELLOWS
BANNISTER WAS VERY MUCH UPSET BY THE INCIDENT
HE HAD NEARLY FAINTED
WHEN WE FOUND THAT THE PAPERS HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN TAMPERED WITH
I GAVE
HIM A LITTLE BRANDY AND LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A
MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM
I SOON SAW THAT THE INTRUDER HAD
LEFT OTHER TRACES OF HIS PRESENCE BESIDES THE RUMPLED PAPERS
ON THE
TABLE IN THE WINDOW WERE SEVERAL SHREDS FROM A PENCIL WHICH HAD BEEN
SHARPENED
A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO
EVIDENTLY THE
RASCAL HAD COPIED THE PAPER IN A GREAT HURRY HAD BROKEN HIS PENCIL AND
HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO PUT A FRESH POINT TO IT
EXCELLENT SAID HOLMES WHO WAS RECOVERING HIS GOOD HUMOUR AS HIS
ATTENTION BECAME MORE ENGROSSED BY THE CASE
FORTUNE HAS BEEN YOUR
FRIEND
THIS WAS NOT ALL
I HAVE A NEW WRITING TABLE WITH A FINE SURFACE OF RED
LEATHER
I AM PREPARED TO SWEAR AND SO IS BANNISTER THAT IT WAS
SMOOTH AND UNSTAINED
NOW I FOUND A CLEAN CUT IN IT ABOUT THREE INCHES
LONG NOT A MERE SCRATCH BUT A POSITIVE CUT
NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON
THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF
SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT
I AM CONVINCED THAT THESE
MARKS WERE LEFT BY THE MAN WHO RIFLED THE PAPERS
THERE WERE NO
FOOTMARKS AND NO OTHER EVIDENCE AS TO HIS IDENTITY
I WAS AT MY WIT'S
END WHEN SUDDENLY THE HAPPY THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME THAT YOU WERE IN THE
TOWN AND I CAME STRAIGHT ROUND TO PUT THE MATTER INTO YOUR HANDS
DO
HELP ME MR
HOLMES
YOU SEE MY DILEMMA
EITHER I MUST FIND THE MAN OR
ELSE THE EXAMINATION MUST BE POSTPONED UNTIL FRESH PAPERS ARE PREPARED
AND SINCE THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT EXPLANATION THERE WILL ENSUE A
HIDEOUS SCANDAL WHICH WILL THROW A CLOUD NOT ONLY ON THE COLLEGE
BUT ON THE UNIVERSITY
ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER
QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT AND TO GIVE YOU SUCH ADVICE AS I
CAN SAID HOLMES RISING AND PUTTING ON HIS OVERCOAT
THE CASE IS NOT
ENTIRELY DEVOID OF INTEREST
HAD ANYONE VISITED YOU IN YOUR ROOM AFTER
THE PAPERS CAME TO YOU
YES YOUNG DAULAT RAS AN INDIAN STUDENT WHO LIVES ON THE SAME STAIR
CAME IN TO ASK ME SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE EXAMINATION
FOR WHICH HE WAS ENTERED
YES
AND THE PAPERS WERE ON YOUR TABLE
TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP
BUT MIGHT BE RECOGNIZED AS PROOFS
POSSIBLY
NO ONE ELSE IN YOUR ROOM
NO
DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE
NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER
DID THIS MAN BANNISTER KNOW
NO CERTAINLY NOT
NO ONE KNEW
WHERE IS BANNISTER NOW
HE WAS VERY ILL POOR FELLOW
I LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN THE CHAIR
I WAS
IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU
YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
I LOCKED UP THE PAPERS FIRST
THEN IT AMOUNTS TO THIS MR
SOAMES THAT UNLESS THE INDIAN STUDENT
RECOGNIZED THE ROLL AS BEING PROOFS THE MAN WHO TAMPERED WITH THEM CAME
UPON THEM ACCIDENTALLY WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE THERE
SO IT SEEMS TO ME
HOLMES GAVE AN ENIGMATIC SMILE
WELL SAID HE LET US GO ROUND
NOT ONE OF YOUR CASES
WATSON MENTAL NOT PHYSICAL
ALL RIGHT COME IF YOU WANT TO
NOW MR
SOAMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL
THE SITTING ROOM OF OUR CLIENT OPENED BY A LONG LOW LATTICED WINDOW ON
TO THE ANCIENT LICHEN TINTED COURT OF THE OLD COLLEGE
A GOTHIC ARCHED
DOOR LED TO A WORN STONE STAIRCASE
ON THE GROUND FLOOR WAS THE TUTOR'S
ROOM
ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
IT WAS ALREADY
TWILIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE SCENE OF OUR PROBLEM
HOLMES HALTED AND
LOOKED EARNESTLY AT THE WINDOW
THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON
TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
HE MUST HAVE ENTERED THROUGH THE DOOR
THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE
ONE PANE SAID OUR LEARNED GUIDE
DEAR ME SAID HOLMES AND HE SMILED IN A SINGULAR WAY AS HE GLANCED
AT OUR COMPANION
WELL IF THERE IS NOTHING TO BE LEARNED HERE WE HAD
BEST GO INSIDE
THE LECTURER UNLOCKED THE OUTER DOOR AND USHERED US INTO HIS ROOM
WE
STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE WHILE HOLMES MADE AN EXAMINATION OF THE CARPET
I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE
ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE
FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY
YOUR SERVANT SEEMS TO HAVE QUITE RECOVERED
YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY
WHICH CHAIR
BY THE WINDOW THERE
I SEE
NEAR THIS LITTLE TABLE
YOU CAN COME IN NOW
I HAVE FINISHED
WITH THE CARPET
LET US TAKE THE LITTLE TABLE FIRST
OF COURSE WHAT HAS
HAPPENED IS VERY CLEAR
THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY
SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE
HE CARRIED THEM OVER TO THE WINDOW TABLE
BECAUSE FROM THERE HE COULD SEE IF YOU CAME ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND SO
COULD EFFECT AN ESCAPE
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOAMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE
SIDE DOOR
AH THAT'S GOOD WELL ANYHOW THAT WAS IN HIS MIND
LET ME SEE THE
THREE STRIPS
NO FINGER IMPRESSIONS NO WELL HE CARRIED OVER THIS ONE
FIRST AND HE COPIED IT
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING
EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
THEN HE
TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN
YOUR RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED
SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE
HAD BEEN THERE
YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY HURRYING FEET ON THE STAIR AS
YOU ENTERED THE OUTER DOOR
NO I CAN'T SAY I WAS
WELL HE WROTE SO FURIOUSLY THAT HE BROKE HIS PENCIL AND HAD AS YOU
OBSERVE TO SHARPEN IT AGAIN
THIS IS OF INTEREST WATSON
THE PENCIL
WAS NOT AN ORDINARY ONE
IT WAS ABOVE THE USUAL SIZE WITH A SOFT LEAD
THE OUTER COLOUR WAS DARK BLUE THE MAKER'S NAME WAS PRINTED IN SILVER
LETTERING AND THE PIECE REMAINING IS ONLY ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF
LONG
LOOK FOR SUCH A PENCIL MR
SOAMES AND YOU HAVE GOT YOUR MAN
WHEN I ADD THAT HE POSSESSES A LARGE AND VERY BLUNT KNIFE YOU HAVE AN
ADDITIONAL AID
MR
SOAMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
I CAN
FOLLOW THE OTHER POINTS SAID HE BUT REALLY IN THIS MATTER OF THE
LENGTH
HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS NN AND A SPACE OF CLEAR
WOOD AFTER THEM
YOU SEE
NO I FEAR THAT EVEN NOW
WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE
THERE ARE OTHERS
WHAT
COULD THIS NN BE IT IS AT THE END OF A WORD
YOU ARE AWARE THAT JOHANN
FABER IS THE MOST COMMON MAKER'S NAME
IS IT NOT CLEAR THAT THERE IS
JUST AS MUCH OF THE PENCIL LEFT AS USUALLY FOLLOWS THE JOHANN HE HELD
THE SMALL TABLE SIDEWAYS TO THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
I WAS HOPING THAT
IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME
THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE
NO I SEE NOTHING
I DON'T THINK
THERE IS ANYTHING MORE TO BE LEARNED HERE
NOW FOR THE CENTRAL TABLE
THIS SMALL PELLET IS I PRESUME THE BLACK DOUGHY MASS YOU SPOKE OF
ROUGHLY PYRAMIDAL IN SHAPE AND HOLLOWED OUT I PERCEIVE
AS YOU SAY
THERE APPEAR TO BE GRAINS OF SAWDUST IN IT
DEAR ME THIS IS VERY
INTERESTING
AND THE CUT A POSITIVE TEAR I SEE
IT BEGAN WITH A
THIN SCRATCH AND ENDED IN A JAGGED HOLE
I AM MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU FOR
DIRECTING MY ATTENTION TO THIS CASE MR
SOAMES
WHERE DOES THAT DOOR
LEAD TO
TO MY BEDROOM
HAVE YOU BEEN IN IT SINCE YOUR ADVENTURE
NO I CAME STRAIGHT AWAY FOR YOU
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A GLANCE ROUND
WHAT A CHARMING OLD FASHIONED
ROOM PERHAPS YOU WILL KINDLY WAIT A MINUTE UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED THE
FLOOR
NO I SEE NOTHING
WHAT ABOUT THIS CURTAIN YOU HANG YOUR CLOTHES
BEHIND IT
IF ANYONE WERE FORCED TO CONCEAL HIMSELF IN THIS ROOM HE MUST
DO IT THERE SINCE THE BED IS TOO LOW AND THE WARDROBE TOO SHALLOW
NO
ONE THERE I SUPPOSE
AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND
ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY
AS A
MATTER OF FACT THE DRAWN CURTAIN DISCLOSED NOTHING BUT THREE OR FOUR
SUITS OF CLOTHES HANGING FROM A LINE OF PEGS
HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND
STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR
HALLOA WHAT'S THIS SAID HE
IT WAS A SMALL PYRAMID OF BLACK PUTTY LIKE STUFF EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE
UPON THE TABLE OF THE STUDY
HOLMES HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE
GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT
YOUR VISITOR SEEMS TO HAVE LEFT TRACES IN YOUR BEDROOM AS WELL AS IN
YOUR SITTING ROOM MR
SOAMES
WHAT COULD HE HAVE WANTED THERE
I THINK IT IS CLEAR ENOUGH
YOU CAME BACK BY AN UNEXPECTED WAY AND SO
HE HAD NO WARNING UNTIL YOU WERE AT THE VERY DOOR
WHAT COULD HE DO
HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR
BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
GOOD GRACIOUS MR
HOLMES DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT ALL THE TIME I
WAS TALKING TO BANNISTER IN THIS ROOM WE HAD THE MAN PRISONER IF WE HAD
ONLY KNOWN IT
SO I READ IT
SURELY THERE IS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE MR
HOLMES
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU OBSERVED MY BEDROOM WINDOW
LATTICE PANED LEAD FRAMEWORK THREE SEPARATE WINDOWS ONE SWINGING ON
HINGE AND LARGE ENOUGH TO ADMIT A MAN
EXACTLY
AND IT LOOKS OUT ON AN ANGLE OF THE COURTYARD SO AS TO BE
PARTLY INVISIBLE
THE MAN MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED HIS ENTRANCE THERE LEFT
TRACES AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE BEDROOM AND FINALLY FINDING THE DOOR
OPEN HAVE ESCAPED THAT WAY
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD IMPATIENTLY
LET US BE PRACTICAL SAID HE
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE
THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR
DOOR
YES THERE ARE
AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION
YES
HAVE YOU ANY REASON TO SUSPECT ANY ONE OF THEM MORE THAN THE OTHERS
SOAMES HESITATED
IT IS A VERY DELICATE QUESTION SAID HE
ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW
SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS
I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS
I WILL TELL YOU THEN IN A FEW WORDS THE CHARACTER OF THE THREE MEN
WHO INHABIT THESE ROOMS
THE LOWER OF THE THREE IS GILCHRIST A FINE
SCHOLAR AND ATHLETE PLAYS IN THE RUGBY TEAM AND THE CRICKET TEAM FOR
THE COLLEGE AND GOT HIS BLUE FOR THE HURDLES AND THE LONG JUMP
HE IS
A FINE MANLY FELLOW
HIS FATHER WAS THE NOTORIOUS SIR JABEZ GILCHRIST
WHO RUINED HIMSELF ON THE TURF
MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT
HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS
HE WILL DO WELL
THE SECOND FLOOR IS INHABITED BY DAULAT RAS THE INDIAN
HE IS A QUIET
INSCRUTABLE FELLOW AS MOST OF THOSE INDIANS ARE
HE IS WELL UP IN HIS
WORK THOUGH HIS GREEK IS HIS WEAK SUBJECT
HE IS STEADY AND METHODICAL
THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MILES MCLAREN
HE IS A BRILLIANT FELLOW WHEN
HE CHOOSES TO WORK ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST INTELLECTS OF THE UNIVERSITY
BUT HE IS WAYWARD DISSIPATED AND UNPRINCIPLED
HE WAS NEARLY EXPELLED
OVER A CARD SCANDAL IN HIS FIRST YEAR
HE HAS BEEN IDLING ALL THIS TERM
AND HE MUST LOOK FORWARD WITH DREAD TO THE EXAMINATION
THEN IT IS HE WHOM YOU SUSPECT
I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT
BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE
LEAST UNLIKELY
EXACTLY
NOW MR
SOAMES LET US HAVE A LOOK AT YOUR SERVANT
BANNISTER
HE WAS A LITTLE WHITE FACED CLEAN SHAVEN GRIZZLY HAIRED FELLOW OF
FIFTY
HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET
ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE
HIS PLUMP FACE WAS TWITCHING WITH HIS NERVOUSNESS
AND HIS FINGERS COULD NOT KEEP STILL
WE ARE INVESTIGATING THIS UNHAPPY BUSINESS BANNISTER SAID HIS
MASTER
YES SIR
I UNDERSTAND SAID HOLMES THAT YOU LEFT YOUR KEY IN THE DOOR
YES SIR
WAS IT NOT VERY EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU SHOULD DO THIS ON THE VERY DAY
WHEN THERE WERE THESE PAPERS INSIDE
IT WAS MOST UNFORTUNATE SIR
BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME
THING AT OTHER TIMES
WHEN DID YOU ENTER THE ROOM
IT WAS ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR
THAT IS MR
SOAMES' TEA TIME
HOW LONG DID YOU STAY
WHEN I SAW THAT HE WAS ABSENT I WITHDREW AT ONCE
DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE
NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
I HAD THE TEA TRAY IN MY HAND
I THOUGHT I WOULD COME BACK FOR THE KEY
THEN I FORGOT
HAS THE OUTER DOOR A SPRING LOCK
NO SIR
THEN IT WAS OPEN ALL THE TIME
YES SIR
ANYONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT
YES SIR
WHEN MR
SOAMES RETURNED AND CALLED FOR YOU YOU WERE VERY MUCH
DISTURBED
YES SIR
SUCH A THING HAS NEVER HAPPENED DURING THE MANY YEARS THAT I
HAVE BEEN HERE
I NEARLY FAINTED SIR
SO I UNDERSTAND
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU BEGAN TO FEEL BAD
WHERE WAS I SIR WHY HERE NEAR THE DOOR
THAT IS SINGULAR BECAUSE YOU SAT DOWN IN THAT CHAIR OVER YONDER NEAR
THE CORNER
WHY DID YOU PASS THESE OTHER CHAIRS
I DON'T KNOW SIR IT DIDN'T MATTER TO ME WHERE I SAT
I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MR
HOLMES
HE WAS LOOKING
VERY BAD QUITE GHASTLY
YOU STAYED HERE WHEN YOUR MASTER LEFT
ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO
THEN I LOCKED THE DOOR AND WENT TO MY ROOM
WHOM DO YOU SUSPECT
OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR
I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ANY
GENTLEMAN IN THIS UNIVERSITY WHO IS CAPABLE OF PROFITING BY SUCH AN
ACTION
NO SIR I'LL NOT BELIEVE IT
THANK YOU THAT WILL DO SAID HOLMES
OH ONE MORE WORD
YOU HAVE NOT
MENTIONED TO ANY OF THE THREE GENTLEMEN WHOM YOU ATTEND THAT ANYTHING IS
AMISS
NO SIR NOT A WORD
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM
NO SIR
VERY GOOD
NOW MR
SOAMES WE WILL TAKE A WALK IN THE QUADRANGLE IF
YOU PLEASE
THREE YELLOW SQUARES OF LIGHT SHONE ABOVE US IN THE GATHERING GLOOM
YOUR THREE BIRDS ARE ALL IN THEIR NESTS SAID HOLMES LOOKING UP
HALLOA WHAT'S THAT ONE OF THEM SEEMS RESTLESS ENOUGH
IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS
BLIND
HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PEEP AT EACH OF THEM SAID HOLMES
IS IT
POSSIBLE
NO DIFFICULTY IN THE WORLD SOAMES ANSWERED
THIS SET OF ROOMS IS
QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO
GO OVER THEM
COME ALONG AND I WILL PERSONALLY CONDUCT YOU
NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCHRIST'S DOOR
A
TALL FLAXEN HAIRED SLIM YOUNG FELLOW OPENED IT AND MADE US WELCOME
WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD OUR ERRAND
THERE WERE SOME REALLY CURIOUS PIECES OF
MEDIAEVAL DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE WITHIN
HOLMES WAS SO CHARMED WITH
ONE OF THEM THAT HE INSISTED ON DRAWING IT IN HIS NOTEBOOK BROKE HIS
PENCIL HAD TO BORROW ONE FROM OUR HOST AND FINALLY BORROWED A KNIFE TO
SHARPEN HIS OWN
THE SAME CURIOUS ACCIDENT HAPPENED TO HIM IN THE ROOMS
OF THE INDIAN A SILENT LITTLE HOOK NOSED FELLOW WHO EYED US ASKANCE
AND WAS OBVIOUSLY GLAD WHEN HOLMES'S ARCHITECTURAL STUDIES HAD COME TO
AN END
I COULD NOT SEE THAT IN EITHER CASE HOLMES HAD COME UPON THE
CLUE FOR WHICH HE WAS SEARCHING
ONLY AT THE THIRD DID OUR VISIT PROVE
ABORTIVE
THE OUTER DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN TO OUR KNOCK AND NOTHING MORE
SUBSTANTIAL THAN A TORRENT OF BAD LANGUAGE CAME FROM BEHIND IT
I
DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE
YOU CAN GO TO BLAZES ROARED THE ANGRY VOICE
TOMORROW'S THE EXAM AND I WON'T BE DRAWN BY ANYONE
A RUDE FELLOW SAID OUR GUIDE FLUSHING WITH ANGER AS WE WITHDREW
DOWN THE STAIR
OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS
KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND
INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS
HOLMES'S RESPONSE WAS A CURIOUS ONE
CAN YOU TELL ME HIS EXACT HEIGHT HE ASKED
REALLY MR
HOLMES I CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO SAY
HE IS TALLER THAN THE
INDIAN NOT SO TALL AS GILCHRIST
I SUPPOSE FIVE FOOT SIX WOULD BE ABOUT
IT
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES
AND NOW MR
SOAMES I WISH YOU
GOOD NIGHT
OUR GUIDE CRIED ALOUD IN HIS ASTONISHMENT AND DISMAY
GOOD GRACIOUS
MR
HOLMES YOU ARE SURELY NOT GOING TO LEAVE ME IN THIS ABRUPT FASHION
YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION
TO MORROW IS THE EXAMINATION
I
MUST TAKE SOME DEFINITE ACTION TO NIGHT
I CANNOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION
TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH
THE SITUATION
MUST BE FACED
YOU MUST LEAVE IT AS IT IS
I SHALL DROP ROUND EARLY TO MORROW MORNING
AND CHAT THE MATTER OVER
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION
THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
MEANWHILE YOU CHANGE
NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL
VERY GOOD MR
HOLMES
YOU CAN BE PERFECTLY EASY IN YOUR MIND
WE SHALL CERTAINLY FIND SOME
WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTIES
I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO
THE PENCIL CUTTINGS
GOOD BYE
WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED
UP AT THE WINDOWS
THE INDIAN STILL PACED HIS ROOM
THE OTHERS WERE
INVISIBLE
WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT HOLMES ASKED AS WE CAME OUT
INTO THE MAIN STREET
QUITE A LITTLE PARLOUR GAME SORT OF THREE CARD
TRICK IS IT NOT THERE ARE YOUR THREE MEN
IT MUST BE ONE OF THEM
YOU
TAKE YOUR CHOICE
WHICH IS YOURS
THE FOUL MOUTHED FELLOW AT THE TOP
HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST
RECORD
AND YET THAT INDIAN WAS A SLY FELLOW ALSO
WHY SHOULD HE BE
PACING HIS ROOM ALL THE TIME
THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT
MANY MEN DO IT WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO LEARN
ANYTHING BY HEART
HE LOOKED AT US IN A QUEER WAY
SO WOULD YOU IF A FLOCK OF STRANGERS CAME IN ON YOU WHEN YOU WERE
PREPARING FOR AN EXAMINATION NEXT DAY AND EVERY MOMENT WAS OF
VALUE
NO I SEE NOTHING IN THAT
PENCILS TOO AND KNIVES ALL WAS
SATISFACTORY
BUT THAT FELLOW DOES PUZZLE ME
WHO
WHY BANNISTER THE SERVANT
WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER
HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN
SO HE DID ME
THAT'S THE PUZZLING PART
WHY SHOULD A PERFECTLY
HONEST MAN WELL WELL HERE'S A LARGE STATIONER'S
WE SHALL BEGIN OUR
RESEARCHES HERE
THERE WERE ONLY FOUR STATIONERS OF ANY CONSEQUENCES IN THE TOWN AND AT
EACH HOLMES PRODUCED HIS PENCIL CHIPS AND BID HIGH FOR A DUPLICATE
ALL
WERE AGREED THAT ONE COULD BE ORDERED BUT THAT IT WAS NOT A USUAL SIZE
OF PENCIL AND THAT IT WAS SELDOM KEPT IN STOCK
MY FRIEND DID NOT
APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS IN
HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION
NO GOOD MY DEAR WATSON
THIS THE BEST AND ONLY FINAL CLUE HAS RUN
TO NOTHING
BUT INDEED I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT THAT WE CAN BUILD UP A
SUFFICIENT CASE WITHOUT IT
BY JOVE MY DEAR FELLOW IT IS NEARLY NINE
AND THE LANDLADY BABBLED OF GREEN PEAS AT SEVEN THIRTY
WHAT WITH YOUR
ETERNAL TOBACCO WATSON AND YOUR IRREGULARITY AT MEALS I EXPECT THAT
YOU WILL GET NOTICE TO QUIT AND THAT I SHALL SHARE YOUR DOWNFALL NOT
HOWEVER BEFORE WE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF THE NERVOUS TUTOR THE
CARELESS SERVANT AND THE THREE ENTERPRISING STUDENTS
HOLMES MADE NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE MATTER THAT DAY THOUGH HE SAT
LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME AFTER OUR BELATED DINNER
AT EIGHT IN
THE MORNING HE CAME INTO MY ROOM JUST AS I FINISHED MY TOILET
WELL WATSON SAID HE IT IS TIME WE WENT DOWN TO ST
LUKE'S
CAN YOU
DO WITHOUT BREAKFAST
CERTAINLY
SOAMES WILL BE IN A DREADFUL FIDGET UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO TELL HIM
SOMETHING POSITIVE
HAVE YOU ANYTHING POSITIVE TO TELL HIM
I THINK SO
YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION
YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
BUT WHAT FRESH EVIDENCE COULD YOU HAVE GOT
AHA IT IS NOT FOR NOTHING THAT I HAVE TURNED MYSELF OUT OF BED AT THE
UNTIMELY HOUR OF SIX
I HAVE PUT IN TWO HOURS' HARD WORK AND COVERED AT
LEAST FIVE MILES WITH SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR IT
LOOK AT THAT
HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK
DOUGHY CLAY
WHY HOLMES YOU HAD ONLY TWO YESTERDAY
AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING
IT IS A FAIR ARGUMENT THAT WHEREVER NO
3
CAME FROM IS ALSO THE SOURCE OF NOS
1 AND 2
EH WATSON WELL COME
ALONG AND PUT FRIEND SOAMES OUT OF HIS PAIN
THE UNFORTUNATE TUTOR WAS CERTAINLY IN A STATE OF PITIABLE AGITATION
WHEN WE FOUND HIM IN HIS CHAMBERS
IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD
COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS
PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUABLE SCHOLARSHIP
HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE
RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED
THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME I FEARED THAT YOU HAD GIVEN IT UP IN
DESPAIR
WHAT AM I TO DO SHALL THE EXAMINATION PROCEED
YES LET IT PROCEED BY ALL MEANS
BUT THIS RASCAL
HE SHALL NOT COMPETE
YOU KNOW HIM
I THINK SO
IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE
OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE
COURT MARTIAL
YOU THERE IF YOU PLEASE SOAMES WATSON YOU HERE I'LL
TAKE THE ARMCHAIR IN THE MIDDLE
I THINK THAT WE ARE NOW SUFFICIENTLY
IMPOSING TO STRIKE TERROR INTO A GUILTY BREAST
KINDLY RING THE BELL
BANNISTER ENTERED AND SHRANK BACK IN EVIDENT SURPRISE AND FEAR AT OUR
JUDICIAL APPEARANCE
YOU WILL KINDLY CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
NOW BANNISTER WILL YOU
PLEASE TELL US THE TRUTH ABOUT YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT
THE MAN TURNED WHITE TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR
I HAVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING SIR
NOTHING TO ADD
NOTHING AT ALL SIR
WELL THEN I MUST MAKE SOME SUGGESTIONS TO YOU
WHEN YOU SAT DOWN
ON THAT CHAIR YESTERDAY DID YOU DO SO IN ORDER TO CONCEAL SOME OBJECT
WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ROOM
BANNISTER'S FACE WAS GHASTLY
NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
IT IS ONLY A SUGGESTION SAID HOLMES SUAVELY
I FRANKLY ADMIT THAT
I AM UNABLE TO PROVE IT
BUT IT SEEMS PROBABLE ENOUGH SINCE THE MOMENT
THAT MR
SOAMES'S BACK WAS TURNED YOU RELEASED THE MAN WHO WAS HIDING
IN THAT BEDROOM
BANNISTER LICKED HIS DRY LIPS
THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
AH THAT'S A PITY BANNISTER
UP TO NOW YOU MAY HAVE SPOKEN THE TRUTH
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LIED
THE MAN'S FACE SET IN SULLEN DEFIANCE
THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
COME COME BANNISTER
NO SIR THERE WAS NO ONE
IN THAT CASE YOU CAN GIVE US NO FURTHER INFORMATION
WOULD YOU PLEASE
REMAIN IN THE ROOM STAND OVER THERE NEAR THE BEDROOM DOOR
NOW SOAMES
I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO HAVE THE GREAT KINDNESS TO GO UP TO THE ROOM OF
YOUNG GILCHRIST AND TO ASK HIM TO STEP DOWN INTO YOURS
AN INSTANT LATER THE TUTOR RETURNED BRINGING WITH HIM THE STUDENT
HE
WAS A FINE FIGURE OF A MAN TALL LITHE AND AGILE WITH A SPRINGY STEP
AND A PLEASANT OPEN FACE
HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US
AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN
THE FARTHER CORNER
JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
NOW MR
GILCHRIST WE ARE ALL
QUITE ALONE HERE AND NO ONE NEED EVER KNOW ONE WORD OF WHAT PASSES
BETWEEN US
WE CAN BE PERFECTLY FRANK WITH EACH OTHER
WE WANT TO KNOW
MR
GILCHRIST HOW YOU AN HONOURABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN
ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN STAGGERED BACK AND CAST A LOOK FULL OF HORROR
AND REPROACH AT BANNISTER
NO NO MR
GILCHRIST SIR I NEVER SAID A WORD NEVER ONE WORD CRIED
THE SERVANT
NO BUT YOU HAVE NOW SAID HOLMES
NOW SIR YOU MUST SEE THAT AFTER
BANNISTER'S WORDS YOUR POSITION IS HOPELESS AND THAT YOUR ONLY CHANCE
LIES IN A FRANK CONFESSION
FOR A MOMENT GILCHRIST WITH UPRAISED HAND TRIED TO CONTROL HIS
WRITHING FEATURES
THE NEXT HE HAD THROWN HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BESIDE
THE TABLE AND BURYING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS HE HAD BURST INTO A STORM
OF PASSIONATE SOBBING
COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST
NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE
EASIER FOR YOU IF I WERE TO TELL MR
SOAMES WHAT OCCURRED AND YOU CAN
CHECK ME WHERE I AM WRONG
SHALL I DO SO WELL WELL DON'T TROUBLE TO
ANSWER
LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE
FROM THE MOMENT MR
SOAMES THAT YOU SAID TO ME THAT NO ONE NOT EVEN
BANNISTER COULD HAVE TOLD THAT THE PAPERS WERE IN YOUR ROOM THE CASE
BEGAN TO TAKE A DEFINITE SHAPE IN MY MIND
THE PRINTER ONE COULD OF
COURSE DISMISS
HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS IN HIS OWN OFFICE
THE
INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
IF THE PROOFS WERE IN A ROLL HE
COULD NOT POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT THEY WERE
ON THE OTHER HAND IT SEEMED AN
UNTHINKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT A MAN SHOULD DARE TO ENTER THE ROOM
AND THAT BY CHANCE ON THAT VERY DAY THE PAPERS WERE ON THE TABLE
I
DISMISSED THAT
THE MAN WHO ENTERED KNEW THAT THE PAPERS WERE THERE
HOW
DID HE KNOW
WHEN I APPROACHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW
YOU AMUSED ME BY
SUPPOSING THAT I WAS CONTEMPLATING THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMEONE HAVING
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT UNDER THE EYES OF ALL THESE OPPOSITE ROOMS FORCED
HIMSELF THROUGH IT
SUCH AN IDEA WAS ABSURD
I WAS MEASURING HOW TALL A
MAN WOULD NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO SEE AS HE PASSED WHAT PAPERS WERE ON
THE CENTRAL TABLE
I AM SIX FEET HIGH AND I COULD DO IT WITH AN EFFORT
NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
ALREADY YOU SEE I HAD REASON
TO THINK THAT IF ONE OF YOUR THREE STUDENTS WAS A MAN OF UNUSUAL
HEIGHT HE WAS THE MOST WORTH WATCHING OF THE THREE
I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF
THE SIDE TABLE
OF THE CENTRE TABLE I COULD MAKE NOTHING UNTIL IN
YOUR DESCRIPTION OF GILCHRIST YOU MENTIONED THAT HE WAS A LONG DISTANCE
JUMPER
THEN THE WHOLE THING CAME TO ME IN AN INSTANT AND I ONLY NEEDED
CERTAIN CORROBORATIVE PROOFS WHICH I SPEEDILY OBTAINED
WHAT HAPPENED WITH SIC THIS THIS YOUNG FELLOW HAD EMPLOYED HIS
AFTERNOON AT THE ATHLETIC GROUNDS WHERE HE HAD BEEN PRACTISING THE
JUMP
HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU
ARE AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES
AS HE PASSED YOUR WINDOW HE
SAW BY MEANS OF HIS GREAT HEIGHT THESE PROOFS UPON YOUR TABLE AND
CONJECTURED WHAT THEY WERE
NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN
THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT
BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT
A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO
ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS
IT WAS NOT A DANGEROUS
EXPLOIT FOR HE COULD ALWAYS PRETEND THAT HE HAD SIMPLY LOOKED IN TO ASK
A QUESTION
WELL WHEN HE SAW THAT THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS IT WAS THEN THAT
HE YIELDED TO TEMPTATION
HE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE
WHAT WAS IT YOU
PUT ON THAT CHAIR NEAR THE WINDOW
GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN
HOLMES LOOKED TRIUMPHANTLY AT BANNISTER
HE PUT HIS GLOVES ON THE
CHAIR AND HE TOOK THE PROOFS SHEET BY SHEET TO COPY THEM
HE THOUGHT
THE TUTOR MUST RETURN BY THE MAIN GATE AND THAT HE WOULD SEE HIM
AS WE
KNOW HE CAME BACK BY THE SIDE GATE
SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY
DOOR
THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE
HE FORGOT HIS GLOVES BUT HE CAUGHT
UP HIS SHOES AND DARTED INTO THE BEDROOM
YOU OBSERVE THAT THE SCRATCH
ON THAT TABLE IS SLIGHT AT ONE SIDE BUT DEEPENS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
BEDROOM DOOR
THAT IN ITSELF IS ENOUGH TO SHOW US THAT THE SHOE HAD BEEN
DRAWN IN THAT DIRECTION AND THAT THE CULPRIT HAD TAKEN REFUGE THERE
THE EARTH ROUND THE SPIKE HAD BEEN LEFT ON THE TABLE AND A SECOND
SAMPLE WAS LOOSENED AND FELL IN THE BEDROOM
I MAY ADD THAT I WALKED OUT
TO THE ATHLETIC GROUNDS THIS MORNING SAW THAT TENACIOUS BLACK CLAY IS
USED IN THE JUMPING PIT AND CARRIED AWAY A SPECIMEN OF IT TOGETHER WITH
SOME OF THE FINE TAN OR SAWDUST WHICH IS STREWN OVER IT TO PREVENT THE
ATHLETE FROM SLIPPING
HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MR
GILCHRIST
THE STUDENT HAD DRAWN HIMSELF ERECT
YES SIR IT IS TRUE SAID HE
GOOD HEAVENS HAVE YOU NOTHING TO ADD CRIED SOAMES
YES SIR I HAVE BUT THE SHOCK OF THIS DISGRACEFUL EXPOSURE HAS
BEWILDERED ME
I HAVE A LETTER HERE MR
SOAMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU
EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT
IT WAS BEFORE I
KNEW THAT MY SIN HAD FOUND ME OUT
HERE IT IS SIR
YOU WILL SEE THAT I
HAVE SAID 'I HAVE DETERMINED NOT TO GO IN FOR THE EXAMINATION
I HAVE
BEEN OFFERED A COMMISSION IN THE RHODESIAN POLICE AND I AM GOING OUT TO
SOUTH AFRICA AT ONCE
I AM INDEED PLEASED TO HEAR THAT YOU DID NOT INTEND TO PROFIT BY YOUR
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE SAID SOAMES
BUT WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR PURPOSE
GILCHRIST POINTED TO BANNISTER
THERE IS THE MAN WHO SET ME IN THE RIGHT PATH SAID HE
COME NOW BANNISTER SAID HOLMES
IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT
I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU
WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
AS TO HIS ESCAPING BY THAT WINDOW IT WAS INCREDIBLE
CAN YOU NOT CLEAR
UP THE LAST POINT IN THIS MYSTERY AND TELL US THE REASONS FOR YOUR
ACTION
IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR
CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
TIME WAS SIR WHEN
I WAS BUTLER TO OLD SIR JABEZ GILCHRIST THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S FATHER
WHEN HE WAS RUINED I CAME TO THE COLLEGE AS SERVANT BUT I NEVER FORGOT
MY OLD EMPLOYER BECAUSE HE WAS DOWN IN THE WORLD
I WATCHED HIS SON ALL
I COULD FOR THE SAKE OF THE OLD DAYS
WELL SIR WHEN I CAME INTO THIS
ROOM YESTERDAY WHEN THE ALARM WAS GIVEN THE VERY FIRST THING I SAW WAS
MR
GILCHRIST'S TAN GLOVES A LYING IN THAT CHAIR
I KNEW THOSE GLOVES
WELL AND I UNDERSTOOD THEIR MESSAGE
IF MR
SOAMES SAW THEM THE GAME
WAS UP
I FLOPPED DOWN INTO THAT CHAIR AND NOTHING WOULD BUDGE ME UNTIL
MR
SOAMES HE WENT FOR YOU
THEN OUT CAME MY POOR YOUNG MASTER WHOM I
HAD DANDLED ON MY KNEE AND CONFESSED IT ALL TO ME
WASN'T IT NATURAL
SIR THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM AND WASN'T IT NATURAL ALSO THAT I SHOULD
TRY TO SPEAK TO HIM AS HIS DEAD FATHER WOULD HAVE DONE AND MAKE HIM
UNDERSTAND THAT HE COULD NOT PROFIT BY SUCH A DEED COULD YOU BLAME ME
SIR
NO INDEED SAID HOLMES HEARTILY SPRINGING TO HIS FEET
WELL
SOAMES I THINK WE HAVE CLEARED YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM UP AND OUR
BREAKFAST AWAITS US AT HOME
COME WATSON AS TO YOU SIR I TRUST THAT
A BRIGHT FUTURE AWAITS YOU IN RHODESIA
FOR ONCE YOU HAVE FALLEN LOW
LET US SEE IN THE FUTURE HOW HIGH YOU CAN RISE
THE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE NEZ
WHEN I LOOK AT THE THREE MASSIVE MANUSCRIPT VOLUMES WHICH CONTAIN OUR
WORK FOR THE YEAR 1894 I CONFESS THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME
OUT OF SUCH A WEALTH OF MATERIAL TO SELECT THE CASES WHICH ARE MOST
INTERESTING IN THEMSELVES AND AT THE SAME TIME MOST CONDUCIVE TO A
DISPLAY OF THOSE PECULIAR POWERS FOR WHICH MY FRIEND WAS FAMOUS
AS I
TURN OVER THE PAGES I SEE MY NOTES UPON THE REPULSIVE STORY OF THE RED
LEECH AND THE TERRIBLE DEATH OF CROSBY THE BANKER
HERE ALSO I FIND
AN ACCOUNT OF THE ADDLETON TRAGEDY AND THE SINGULAR CONTENTS OF THE
ANCIENT BRITISH BARROW
THE FAMOUS SMITH MORTIMER SUCCESSION CASE COMES
ALSO WITHIN THIS PERIOD AND SO DOES THE TRACKING AND ARREST OF HURET
THE BOULEVARD ASSASSIN AN EXPLOIT WHICH WON FOR HOLMES AN AUTOGRAPH
LETTER OF THANKS FROM THE FRENCH PRESIDENT AND THE ORDER OF THE LEGION
OF HONOUR
EACH OF THESE WOULD FURNISH A NARRATIVE BUT ON THE WHOLE
I AM OF OPINION THAT NONE OF THEM UNITES SO MANY SINGULAR POINTS OF
INTEREST AS THE EPISODE OF YOXLEY OLD PLACE WHICH INCLUDES NOT ONLY THE
LAMENTABLE DEATH OF YOUNG WILLOUGHBY SMITH BUT ALSO THOSE SUBSEQUENT
DEVELOPMENTS WHICH THREW SO CURIOUS A LIGHT UPON THE CAUSES OF THE
CRIME
IT WAS A WILD TEMPESTUOUS NIGHT TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF NOVEMBER
HOLMES AND I SAT TOGETHER IN SILENCE ALL THE EVENING HE ENGAGED WITH A
POWERFUL LENS DECIPHERING THE REMAINS OF THE ORIGINAL INSCRIPTION UPON
A PALIMPSEST I DEEP IN A RECENT TREATISE UPON SURGERY
OUTSIDE THE
WIND HOWLED DOWN BAKER STREET WHILE THE RAIN BEAT FIERCELY AGAINST THE
WINDOWS
IT WAS STRANGE THERE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF THE TOWN WITH TEN
MILES OF MAN'S HANDIWORK ON EVERY SIDE OF US TO FEEL THE IRON GRIP OF
NATURE AND TO BE CONSCIOUS THAT TO THE HUGE ELEMENTAL FORCES ALL LONDON
WAS NO MORE THAN THE MOLEHILLS THAT DOT THE FIELDS
I WALKED TO THE
WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT ON THE DESERTED STREET
THE OCCASIONAL LAMPS
GLEAMED ON THE EXPANSE OF MUDDY ROAD AND SHINING PAVEMENT
A SINGLE CAB
WAS SPLASHING ITS WAY FROM THE OXFORD STREET END
WELL WATSON IT'S AS WELL WE HAVE NOT TO TURN OUT TO NIGHT SAID
HOLMES LAYING ASIDE HIS LENS AND ROLLING UP THE PALIMPSEST
I'VE DONE
ENOUGH FOR ONE SITTING
IT IS TRYING WORK FOR THE EYES
SO FAR AS I CAN
MAKE OUT IT IS NOTHING MORE EXCITING THAN AN ABBEY'S ACCOUNTS DATING
FROM THE SECOND HALF OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
HALLOA HALLOA HALLOA
WHAT'S THIS
AMID THE DRONING OF THE WIND THERE HAD COME THE STAMPING OF A HORSE'S
HOOFS AND THE LONG GRIND OF A WHEEL AS IT RASPED AGAINST THE CURB
THE
CAB WHICH I HAD SEEN HAD PULLED UP AT OUR DOOR
WHAT CAN HE WANT I EJACULATED AS A MAN STEPPED OUT OF IT
WANT HE WANTS US
AND WE MY POOR WATSON WANT OVERCOATS AND CRAVATS
AND GOLOSHES AND EVERY AID THAT MAN EVER INVENTED TO FIGHT THE WEATHER
WAIT A BIT THOUGH THERE'S THE CAB OFF AGAIN THERE'S HOPE YET
HE'D
HAVE KEPT IT IF HE HAD WANTED US TO COME
RUN DOWN MY DEAR FELLOW AND
OPEN THE DOOR FOR ALL VIRTUOUS FOLK HAVE BEEN LONG IN BED
WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE HALL LAMP FELL UPON OUR MIDNIGHT VISITOR I HAD NO
DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNIZING HIM
IT WAS YOUNG STANLEY HOPKINS A PROMISING
DETECTIVE IN WHOSE CAREER HOLMES HAD SEVERAL TIMES SHOWN A VERY
PRACTICAL INTEREST
IS HE IN HE ASKED EAGERLY
COME UP MY DEAR SIR SAID HOLMES'S VOICE FROM ABOVE
I HOPE YOU HAVE
NO DESIGNS UPON US SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
THE DETECTIVE MOUNTED THE STAIRS AND OUR LAMP GLEAMED UPON HIS SHINING
WATERPROOF
I HELPED HIM OUT OF IT WHILE HOLMES KNOCKED A BLAZE OUT OF
THE LOGS IN THE GRATE
NOW MY DEAR HOPKINS DRAW UP AND WARM YOUR TOES SAID HE
HERE'S
A CIGAR AND THE DOCTOR HAS A PRESCRIPTION CONTAINING HOT WATER AND A
LEMON WHICH IS GOOD MEDICINE ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS
IT MUST BE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT WHICH HAS BROUGHT YOU OUT IN SUCH A GALE
IT IS INDEED MR
HOLMES
I'VE HAD A BUSTLING AFTERNOON I PROMISE YOU
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING OF THE YOXLEY CASE IN THE LATEST EDITIONS
I'VE SEEN NOTHING LATER THAN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY TO DAY
WELL IT WAS ONLY A PARAGRAPH AND ALL WRONG AT THAT SO YOU HAVE NOT
MISSED ANYTHING
I HAVEN'T LET THE GRASS GROW UNDER MY FEET
IT'S DOWN
IN KENT SEVEN MILES FROM CHATHAM AND THREE FROM THE RAILWAY LINE
I
WAS WIRED FOR AT 3 15 REACHED YOXLEY OLD PLACE AT 5 CONDUCTED MY
INVESTIGATION WAS BACK AT CHARING CROSS BY THE LAST TRAIN AND STRAIGHT
TO YOU BY CAB
WHICH MEANS I SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE NOT QUITE CLEAR ABOUT YOUR CASE
IT MEANS THAT I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT
SO FAR AS I CAN
SEE IT IS JUST AS TANGLED A BUSINESS AS EVER I HANDLED AND YET AT
FIRST IT SEEMED SO SIMPLE THAT ONE COULDN'T GO WRONG
THERE'S NO MOTIVE
MR
HOLMES
THAT'S WHAT BOTHERS ME I CAN'T PUT MY HAND ON A MOTIVE
HERE'S A MAN DEAD THERE'S NO DENYING THAT BUT SO FAR AS I CAN SEE NO
REASON ON EARTH WHY ANYONE SHOULD WISH HIM HARM
HOLMES LIT HIS CIGAR AND LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
LET US HEAR ABOUT IT SAID HE
I'VE GOT MY FACTS PRETTY CLEAR SAID STANLEY HOPKINS
ALL I WANT NOW
IS TO KNOW WHAT THEY ALL MEAN
THE STORY SO FAR AS I CAN MAKE IT OUT
IS LIKE THIS
SOME YEARS AGO THIS COUNTRY HOUSE YOXLEY OLD PLACE WAS
TAKEN BY AN ELDERLY MAN WHO GAVE THE NAME OF PROFESSOR CORAM
HE WAS
AN INVALID KEEPING HIS BED HALF THE TIME AND THE OTHER HALF HOBBLING
ROUND THE HOUSE WITH A STICK OR BEING PUSHED ABOUT THE GROUNDS BY THE
GARDENER IN A BATH CHAIR
HE WAS WELL LIKED BY THE FEW NEIGHBOURS WHO
CALLED UPON HIM AND HE HAS THE REPUTATION DOWN THERE OF BEING A VERY
LEARNED MAN
HIS HOUSEHOLD USED TO CONSIST OF AN ELDERLY HOUSEKEEPER
MRS
MARKER AND OF A MAID SUSAN TARLTON
THESE HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HIM
SINCE HIS ARRIVAL AND THEY SEEM TO BE WOMEN OF EXCELLENT CHARACTER
THE
PROFESSOR IS WRITING A LEARNED BOOK AND HE FOUND IT NECESSARY ABOUT
A YEAR AGO TO ENGAGE A SECRETARY
THE FIRST TWO THAT HE TRIED WERE
NOT SUCCESSES BUT THE THIRD MR
WILLOUGHBY SMITH A VERY YOUNG MAN
STRAIGHT FROM THE UNIVERSITY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN JUST WHAT HIS EMPLOYER
WANTED
HIS WORK CONSISTED IN WRITING ALL THE MORNING TO THE PROFESSOR'S
DICTATION AND HE USUALLY SPENT THE EVENING IN HUNTING UP REFERENCES AND
PASSAGES WHICH BORE UPON THE NEXT DAY'S WORK
THIS WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAS
NOTHING AGAINST HIM EITHER AS A BOY AT UPPINGHAM OR AS A YOUNG MAN AT
CAMBRIDGE
I HAVE SEEN HIS TESTIMONIALS AND FROM THE FIRST HE WAS A
DECENT QUIET HARD WORKING FELLOW WITH NO WEAK SPOT IN HIM AT ALL
AND YET THIS IS THE LAD WHO HAS MET HIS DEATH THIS MORNING IN THE
PROFESSOR'S STUDY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CAN POINT ONLY TO MURDER
THE WIND HOWLED AND SCREAMED AT THE WINDOWS
HOLMES AND I DREW CLOSER TO
THE FIRE WHILE THE YOUNG INSPECTOR SLOWLY AND POINT BY POINT DEVELOPED
HIS SINGULAR NARRATIVE
IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH ALL ENGLAND SAID HE I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD
FIND A HOUSEHOLD MORE SELF CONTAINED OR FREER FROM OUTSIDE INFLUENCES
WHOLE WEEKS WOULD PASS AND NOT ONE OF THEM GO PAST THE GARDEN GATE
THE PROFESSOR WAS BURIED IN HIS WORK AND EXISTED FOR NOTHING ELSE
YOUNG SMITH KNEW NOBODY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND LIVED VERY MUCH AS
HIS EMPLOYER DID
THE TWO WOMEN HAD NOTHING TO TAKE THEM FROM THE
HOUSE
MORTIMER THE GARDENER WHO WHEELS THE BATH CHAIR IS AN ARMY
PENSIONER AN OLD CRIMEAN MAN OF EXCELLENT CHARACTER
HE DOES NOT LIVE
IN THE HOUSE BUT IN A THREE ROOMED COTTAGE AT THE OTHER END OF THE
GARDEN
THOSE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULD FIND WITHIN THE GROUNDS
OF YOXLEY OLD PLACE
AT THE SAME TIME THE GATE OF THE GARDEN IS A
HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE MAIN LONDON TO CHATHAM ROAD
IT OPENS WITH A
LATCH AND THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM WALKING IN
NOW I WILL GIVE YOU THE EVIDENCE OF SUSAN TARLTON WHO IS THE ONLY
PERSON WHO CAN SAY ANYTHING POSITIVE ABOUT THE MATTER
IT WAS IN THE
FORENOON BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE
SHE WAS ENGAGED AT THE MOMENT IN
HANGING SOME CURTAINS IN THE UPSTAIRS FRONT BEDROOM
PROFESSOR CORAM WAS
STILL IN BED FOR WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD HE SELDOM RISES BEFORE MIDDAY
THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS BUSIED WITH SOME WORK IN THE BACK OF THE
HOUSE
WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAD BEEN IN HIS BEDROOM WHICH HE USES AS A
SITTING ROOM BUT THE MAID HEARD HIM AT THAT MOMENT PASS ALONG THE
PASSAGE AND DESCEND TO THE STUDY IMMEDIATELY BELOW HER
SHE DID NOT
SEE HIM BUT SHE SAYS THAT SHE COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN IN HIS QUICK FIRM
TREAD
SHE DID NOT HEAR THE STUDY DOOR CLOSE BUT A MINUTE OR SO LATER
THERE WAS A DREADFUL CRY IN THE ROOM BELOW
IT WAS A WILD HOARSE
SCREAM SO STRANGE AND UNNATURAL THAT IT MIGHT HAVE COME EITHER FROM A
MAN OR A WOMAN
AT THE SAME INSTANT THERE WAS A HEAVY THUD WHICH SHOOK
THE OLD HOUSE AND THEN ALL WAS SILENCE
THE MAID STOOD PETRIFIED FOR A
MOMENT AND THEN RECOVERING HER COURAGE SHE RAN DOWNSTAIRS
THE STUDY
DOOR WAS SHUT AND SHE OPENED IT
INSIDE YOUNG MR
WILLOUGHBY SMITH WAS
STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR
AT FIRST SHE COULD SEE NO INJURY BUT AS SHE
TRIED TO RAISE HIM SHE SAW THAT BLOOD WAS POURING FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF
HIS NECK
IT WAS PIERCED BY A VERY SMALL BUT VERY DEEP WOUND WHICH HAD
DIVIDED THE CAROTID ARTERY
THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH THE INJURY HAD
BEEN INFLICTED LAY UPON THE CARPET BESIDE HIM
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SMALL
SEALING WAX KNIVES TO BE FOUND ON OLD FASHIONED WRITING TABLES WITH
AN IVORY HANDLE AND A STIFF BLADE
IT WAS PART OF THE FITTINGS OF THE
PROFESSOR'S OWN DESK
AT FIRST THE MAID THOUGHT THAT YOUNG SMITH WAS ALREADY DEAD BUT ON
POURING SOME WATER FROM THE CARAFE OVER HIS FOREHEAD HE OPENED HIS EYES
FOR AN INSTANT
'THE PROFESSOR HE MURMURED 'IT WAS SHE THE MAID IS
PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT THOSE WERE THE EXACT WORDS
HE TRIED DESPERATELY
TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE AND HE HELD HIS RIGHT HAND UP IN THE AIR
THEN HE
FELL BACK DEAD
IN THE MEANTIME THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD ALSO ARRIVED UPON THE SCENE BUT
SHE WAS JUST TOO LATE TO CATCH THE YOUNG MAN'S DYING WORDS
LEAVING
SUSAN WITH THE BODY SHE HURRIED TO THE PROFESSOR'S ROOM
HE WAS SITTING
UP IN BED HORRIBLY AGITATED FOR HE HAD HEARD ENOUGH TO CONVINCE HIM
THAT SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAD OCCURRED
MRS
MARKER IS PREPARED TO SWEAR
THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS STILL IN HIS NIGHT CLOTHES AND INDEED IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DRESS WITHOUT THE HELP OF MORTIMER WHOSE ORDERS
WERE TO COME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK
THE PROFESSOR DECLARES THAT HE HEARD THE
DISTANT CRY BUT THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING MORE
HE CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION
OF THE YOUNG MAN'S LAST WORDS 'THE PROFESSOR IT WAS SHE BUT IMAGINES
THAT THEY WERE THE OUTCOME OF DELIRIUM
HE BELIEVES THAT WILLOUGHBY
SMITH HAD NOT AN ENEMY IN THE WORLD AND CAN GIVE NO REASON FOR THE
CRIME
HIS FIRST ACTION WAS TO SEND MORTIMER THE GARDENER FOR THE
LOCAL POLICE
A LITTLE LATER THE CHIEF CONSTABLE SENT FOR ME
NOTHING
WAS MOVED BEFORE I GOT THERE AND STRICT ORDERS WERE GIVEN THAT NO
ONE SHOULD WALK UPON THE PATHS LEADING TO THE HOUSE
IT WAS A SPLENDID
CHANCE OF PUTTING YOUR THEORIES INTO PRACTICE MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING WANTING
EXCEPT MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID MY COMPANION WITH A SOMEWHAT BITTER
SMILE
WELL LET US HEAR ABOUT IT
WHAT SORT OF A JOB DID YOU MAKE OF
IT
I MUST ASK YOU FIRST MR
HOLMES TO GLANCE AT THIS ROUGH PLAN WHICH
WILL GIVE YOU A GENERAL IDEA OF THE POSITION OF THE PROFESSOR'S STUDY
AND THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THE CASE
IT WILL HELP YOU IN FOLLOWING MY
INVESTIGATION
HE UNFOLDED THE ROUGH CHART WHICH I HERE REPRODUCE
GRAPHIC
AND HE LAID IT ACROSS HOLMES'S KNEE
I ROSE AND STANDING BEHIND HOLMES
STUDIED IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
IT IS VERY ROUGH OF COURSE AND IT ONLY DEALS WITH THE POINTS
WHICH SEEM TO ME TO BE ESSENTIAL
ALL THE REST YOU WILL SEE LATER FOR
YOURSELF
NOW FIRST OF ALL PRESUMING THAT THE ASSASSIN ENTERED THE
HOUSE HOW DID HE OR SHE COME IN UNDOUBTEDLY BY THE GARDEN PATH AND THE
BACK DOOR FROM WHICH THERE IS DIRECT ACCESS TO THE STUDY
ANY OTHER WAY
WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY COMPLICATED
THE ESCAPE MUST HAVE ALSO BEEN
MADE ALONG THAT LINE FOR OF THE TWO OTHER EXITS FROM THE ROOM ONE WAS
BLOCKED BY SUSAN AS SHE RAN DOWNSTAIRS AND THE OTHER LEADS STRAIGHT TO
THE PROFESSOR'S BEDROOM
I THEREFORE DIRECTED MY ATTENTION AT ONCE
TO THE GARDEN PATH WHICH WAS SATURATED WITH RECENT RAIN AND WOULD
CERTAINLY SHOW ANY FOOTMARKS
MY EXAMINATION SHOWED ME THAT I WAS DEALING WITH A CAUTIOUS AND EXPERT
CRIMINAL
NO FOOTMARKS WERE TO BE FOUND ON THE PATH
THERE COULD BE NO
QUESTION HOWEVER THAT SOMEONE HAD PASSED ALONG THE GRASS BORDER WHICH
LINES THE PATH AND THAT HE HAD DONE SO IN ORDER TO AVOID LEAVING A
TRACK
I COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A DISTINCT IMPRESSION
BUT THE GRASS WAS TRODDEN DOWN AND SOMEONE HAD UNDOUBTEDLY PASSED
IT
COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN THE MURDERER SINCE NEITHER THE GARDENER NOR ANYONE
ELSE HAD BEEN THERE THAT MORNING AND THE RAIN HAD ONLY BEGUN DURING THE
NIGHT
ONE MOMENT SAID HOLMES
WHERE DOES THIS PATH LEAD TO
TO THE ROAD
HOW LONG IS IT
A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO
AT THE POINT WHERE THE PATH PASSES THROUGH THE GATE YOU COULD SURELY
PICK UP THE TRACKS
UNFORTUNATELY THE PATH WAS TILED AT THAT POINT
WELL ON THE ROAD ITSELF
NO IT WAS ALL TRODDEN INTO MIRE
TUT TUT WELL THEN THESE TRACKS UPON THE GRASS WERE THEY COMING OR
GOING
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY
THERE WAS NEVER ANY OUTLINE
A LARGE FOOT OR A SMALL
YOU COULD NOT DISTINGUISH
HOLMES GAVE AN EJACULATION OF IMPATIENCE
IT HAS BEEN POURING RAIN AND BLOWING A HURRICANE EVER SINCE SAID
HE
IT WILL BE HARDER TO READ NOW THAN THAT PALIMPSEST
WELL WELL IT
CAN'T BE HELPED
WHAT DID YOU DO HOPKINS AFTER YOU HAD MADE CERTAIN
THAT YOU HAD MADE CERTAIN OF NOTHING
I THINK I MADE CERTAIN OF A GOOD DEAL MR
HOLMES
I KNEW THAT SOMEONE
HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE CAUTIOUSLY FROM WITHOUT
I NEXT EXAMINED THE
CORRIDOR
IT IS LINED WITH COCOANUT MATTING AND HAD TAKEN NO IMPRESSION
OF ANY KIND
THIS BROUGHT ME INTO THE STUDY ITSELF
IT IS A SCANTILY
FURNISHED ROOM
THE MAIN ARTICLE IS A LARGE WRITING TABLE WITH A FIXED
BUREAU
THIS BUREAU CONSISTS OF A DOUBLE COLUMN OF DRAWERS WITH A
CENTRAL SMALL CUPBOARD BETWEEN THEM
THE DRAWERS WERE OPEN THE CUPBOARD
LOCKED
THE DRAWERS IT SEEMS WERE ALWAYS OPEN AND NOTHING OF VALUE
WAS KEPT IN THEM
THERE WERE SOME PAPERS OF IMPORTANCE IN THE CUPBOARD
BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS THAT THIS HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH AND THE
PROFESSOR ASSURES ME THAT NOTHING WAS MISSING
IT IS CERTAIN THAT NO
ROBBERY HAS BEEN COMMITTED
I COME NOW TO THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN
IT WAS FOUND NEAR THE BUREAU
AND JUST TO THE LEFT OF IT AS MARKED UPON THAT CHART
THE STAB WAS ON
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE NECK AND FROM BEHIND FORWARD SO THAT IT IS ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SELF INFLICTED
UNLESS HE FELL UPON THE KNIFE SAID HOLMES
EXACTLY
THE IDEA CROSSED MY MIND
BUT WE FOUND THE KNIFE SOME FEET
AWAY FROM THE BODY SO THAT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE
THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE
THE MAN'S OWN DYING WORDS
AND FINALLY THERE WAS THIS VERY IMPORTANT
PIECE OF EVIDENCE WHICH WAS FOUND CLASPED IN THE DEAD MAN'S RIGHT HAND
FROM HIS POCKET STANLEY HOPKINS DREW A SMALL PAPER PACKET
HE UNFOLDED
IT AND DISCLOSED A GOLDEN PINCE NEZ WITH TWO BROKEN ENDS OF BLACK
SILK CORD DANGLING FROM THE END OF IT
WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAD EXCELLENT
SIGHT HE ADDED
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT THIS WAS SNATCHED FROM
THE FACE OR THE PERSON OF THE ASSASSIN
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK THE GLASSES INTO HIS HAND AND EXAMINED THEM WITH
THE UTMOST ATTENTION AND INTEREST
HE HELD THEM ON HIS NOSE ENDEAVOURED
TO READ THROUGH THEM WENT TO THE WINDOW AND STARED UP THE STREET WITH
THEM LOOKED AT THEM MOST MINUTELY IN THE FULL LIGHT OF THE LAMP AND
FINALLY WITH A CHUCKLE SEATED HIMSELF AT THE TABLE AND WROTE A FEW
LINES UPON A SHEET OF PAPER WHICH HE TOSSED ACROSS TO STANLEY HOPKINS
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO FOR YOU SAID HE
IT MAY PROVE TO BE OF SOME
USE
THE ASTONISHED DETECTIVE READ THE NOTE ALOUD
IT RAN AS FOLLOWS
WANTED A WOMAN OF GOOD ADDRESS ATTIRED LIKE A LADY
SHE HAS A
REMARKABLY THICK NOSE WITH EYES WHICH ARE SET CLOSE UPON EITHER SIDE
OF IT
SHE HAS A PUCKERED FOREHEAD A PEERING EXPRESSION AND PROBABLY
ROUNDED SHOULDERS
THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SHE HAS HAD RECOURSE TO AN
OPTICIAN AT LEAST TWICE DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS
AS HER GLASSES ARE
OF REMARKABLE STRENGTH AND AS OPTICIANS ARE NOT VERY NUMEROUS THERE
SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN TRACING HER
HOLMES SMILED AT THE ASTONISHMENT OF HOPKINS WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN
REFLECTED UPON MY FEATURES
SURELY MY DEDUCTIONS ARE SIMPLICITY
ITSELF SAID HE
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO NAME ANY ARTICLES WHICH
AFFORD A FINER FIELD FOR INFERENCE THAN A PAIR OF GLASSES ESPECIALLY
SO REMARKABLE A PAIR AS THESE
THAT THEY BELONG TO A WOMAN I INFER FROM
THEIR DELICACY AND ALSO OF COURSE FROM THE LAST WORDS OF THE DYING
MAN
AS TO HER BEING A PERSON OF REFINEMENT AND WELL DRESSED THEY
ARE AS YOU PERCEIVE HANDSOMELY MOUNTED IN SOLID GOLD AND IT IS
INCONCEIVABLE THAT ANYONE WHO WORE SUCH GLASSES COULD BE SLATTERNLY IN
OTHER RESPECTS
YOU WILL FIND THAT THE CLIPS ARE TOO WIDE FOR YOUR NOSE
SHOWING THAT THE LADY'S NOSE WAS VERY BROAD AT THE BASE
THIS SORT OF
NOSE IS USUALLY A SHORT AND COARSE ONE BUT THERE IS A SUFFICIENT NUMBER
OF EXCEPTIONS TO PREVENT ME FROM BEING DOGMATIC OR FROM INSISTING UPON
THIS POINT IN MY DESCRIPTION
MY OWN FACE IS A NARROW ONE AND YET I
FIND THAT I CANNOT GET MY EYES INTO THE CENTRE NOR NEAR THE CENTRE OF
THESE GLASSES
THEREFORE THE LADY'S EYES ARE SET VERY NEAR TO THE SIDES
OF THE NOSE
YOU WILL PERCEIVE WATSON THAT THE GLASSES ARE CONCAVE
AND OF UNUSUAL STRENGTH
A LADY WHOSE VISION HAS BEEN SO EXTREMELY
CONTRACTED ALL HER LIFE IS SURE TO HAVE THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
OF SUCH VISION WHICH ARE SEEN IN THE FOREHEAD THE EYELIDS AND THE
SHOULDERS
YES I SAID I CAN FOLLOW EACH OF YOUR ARGUMENTS
I CONFESS HOWEVER
THAT I AM UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU ARRIVE AT THE DOUBLE VISIT TO THE
OPTICIAN
HOLMES TOOK THE GLASSES IN HIS HAND
YOU WILL PERCEIVE HE SAID THAT THE CLIPS ARE LINED WITH TINY
BANDS OF CORK TO SOFTEN THE PRESSURE UPON THE NOSE
ONE OF THESE IS
DISCOLOURED AND WORN TO SOME SLIGHT EXTENT BUT THE OTHER IS NEW
EVIDENTLY ONE HAS FALLEN OFF AND BEEN REPLACED
I SHOULD JUDGE THAT THE
OLDER OF THEM HAS NOT BEEN THERE MORE THAN A FEW MONTHS
THEY
EXACTLY CORRESPOND SO I GATHER THAT THE LADY WENT BACK TO THE SAME
ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE SECOND
BY GEORGE IT'S MARVELLOUS CRIED HOPKINS IN AN ECSTASY OF
ADMIRATION
TO THINK THAT I HAD ALL THAT EVIDENCE IN MY HAND AND
NEVER KNEW IT I HAD INTENDED HOWEVER TO GO THE ROUND OF THE LONDON
OPTICIANS
OF COURSE YOU WOULD
MEANWHILE HAVE YOU ANYTHING MORE TO TELL US ABOUT
THE CASE
NOTHING MR
HOLMES
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS I DO
NOW PROBABLY MORE
WE HAVE HAD INQUIRIES MADE AS TO ANY STRANGER SEEN
ON THE COUNTRY ROADS OR AT THE RAILWAY STATION
WE HAVE HEARD OF NONE
WHAT BEATS ME IS THE UTTER WANT OF ALL OBJECT IN THE CRIME
NOT A GHOST
OF A MOTIVE CAN ANYONE SUGGEST
AH THERE I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO HELP YOU
BUT I SUPPOSE YOU WANT US
TO COME OUT TO MORROW
IF IT IS NOT ASKING TOO MUCH MR
HOLMES
THERE'S A TRAIN FROM CHARING
CROSS TO CHATHAM AT SIX IN THE MORNING AND WE SHOULD BE AT YOXLEY OLD
PLACE BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE
THEN WE SHALL TAKE IT
YOUR CASE HAS CERTAINLY SOME FEATURES OF GREAT
INTEREST AND I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO LOOK INTO IT
WELL IT'S NEARLY
ONE AND WE HAD BEST GET A FEW HOURS' SLEEP
I DARESAY YOU CAN MANAGE
ALL RIGHT ON THE SOFA IN FRONT OF THE FIRE
I'LL LIGHT MY SPIRIT LAMP
AND GIVE YOU A CUP OF COFFEE BEFORE WE START
THE GALE HAD BLOWN ITSELF OUT NEXT DAY BUT IT WAS A BITTER MORNING WHEN
WE STARTED UPON OUR JOURNEY
WE SAW THE COLD WINTER SUN RISE OVER THE
DREARY MARSHES OF THE THAMES AND THE LONG SULLEN REACHES OF THE RIVER
WHICH I SHALL EVER ASSOCIATE WITH OUR PURSUIT OF THE ANDAMAN ISLANDER
IN THE EARLIER DAYS OF OUR CAREER
AFTER A LONG AND WEARY JOURNEY WE
ALIGHTED AT A SMALL STATION SOME MILES FROM CHATHAM
WHILE A HORSE WAS
BEING PUT INTO A TRAP AT THE LOCAL INN WE SNATCHED A HURRIED BREAKFAST
AND SO WE WERE ALL READY FOR BUSINESS WHEN WE AT LAST ARRIVED AT YOXLEY
OLD PLACE
A CONSTABLE MET US AT THE GARDEN GATE
WELL WILSON ANY NEWS
NO SIR NOTHING
NO REPORTS OF ANY STRANGER SEEN
NO SIR
DOWN AT THE STATION THEY ARE CERTAIN THAT NO STRANGER EITHER
CAME OR WENT YESTERDAY
HAVE YOU HAD INQUIRIES MADE AT INNS AND LODGINGS
YES SIR THERE IS NO ONE THAT WE CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR
WELL IT'S ONLY A REASONABLE WALK TO CHATHAM
ANYONE MIGHT STAY THERE
OR TAKE A TRAIN WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED
THIS IS THE GARDEN PATH OF
WHICH I SPOKE MR
HOLMES
I'LL PLEDGE MY WORD THERE WAS NO MARK ON IT
YESTERDAY
ON WHICH SIDE WERE THE MARKS ON THE GRASS
THIS SIDE SIR
THIS NARROW MARGIN OF GRASS BETWEEN THE PATH AND THE
FLOWER BED
I CAN'T SEE THE TRACES NOW BUT THEY WERE CLEAR TO ME THEN
YES YES SOMEONE HAS PASSED ALONG SAID HOLMES STOOPING OVER THE
GRASS BORDER
OUR LADY MUST HAVE PICKED HER STEPS CAREFULLY MUST SHE
NOT SINCE ON THE ONE SIDE SHE WOULD LEAVE A TRACK ON THE PATH AND ON
THE OTHER AN EVEN CLEARER ONE ON THE SOFT BED
YES SIR SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A COOL HAND
I SAW AN INTENT LOOK PASS OVER HOLMES'S FACE
YOU SAY THAT SHE MUST HAVE COME BACK THIS WAY
YES SIR THERE IS NO OTHER
ON THIS STRIP OF GRASS
CERTAINLY MR
HOLMES
HUM IT WAS A VERY REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE VERY REMARKABLE
WELL I
THINK WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE PATH
LET US GO FARTHER
THIS GARDEN DOOR IS
USUALLY KEPT OPEN I SUPPOSE THEN THIS VISITOR HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT
TO WALK IN
THE IDEA OF MURDER WAS NOT IN HER MIND OR SHE WOULD HAVE
PROVIDED HERSELF WITH SOME SORT OF WEAPON INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PICK
THIS KNIFE OFF THE WRITING TABLE
SHE ADVANCED ALONG THIS CORRIDOR
LEAVING NO TRACES UPON THE COCOANUT MATTING
THEN SHE FOUND HERSELF IN
THIS STUDY
HOW LONG WAS SHE THERE WE HAVE NO MEANS OF JUDGING
NOT MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES SIR
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT MRS
MARKER THE HOUSEKEEPER HAD BEEN IN THERE TIDYING NOT VERY LONG
BEFORE ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE SAYS
WELL THAT GIVES US A LIMIT
OUR LADY ENTERS THIS ROOM AND WHAT DOES
SHE DO SHE GOES OVER TO THE WRITING TABLE
WHAT FOR NOT FOR ANYTHING
IN THE DRAWERS
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANYTHING WORTH HER TAKING IT WOULD
SURELY HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP
NO IT WAS FOR SOMETHING IN THAT WOODEN
BUREAU
HALLOA WHAT IS THAT SCRATCH UPON THE FACE OF IT JUST HOLD A
MATCH WATSON
WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME OF THIS HOPKINS
THE MARK WHICH HE WAS EXAMINING BEGAN UPON THE BRASS WORK ON THE
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE KEYHOLE AND EXTENDED FOR ABOUT FOUR INCHES
WHERE IT HAD SCRATCHED THE VARNISH FROM THE SURFACE
I NOTICED IT MR
HOLMES BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND SCRATCHES ROUND A
KEYHOLE
THIS IS RECENT QUITE RECENT
SEE HOW THE BRASS SHINES WHERE IT IS
CUT
AN OLD SCRATCH WOULD BE THE SAME COLOUR AS THE SURFACE
LOOK AT IT
THROUGH MY LENS
THERE'S THE VARNISH TOO LIKE EARTH ON EACH SIDE OF A
FURROW
IS MRS
MARKER THERE
A SAD FACED ELDERLY WOMAN CAME INTO THE ROOM
DID YOU DUST THIS BUREAU YESTERDAY MORNING
YES SIR
DID YOU NOTICE THIS SCRATCH
NO SIR I DID NOT
I AM SURE YOU DID NOT FOR A DUSTER WOULD HAVE SWEPT AWAY THESE SHREDS
OF VARNISH
WHO HAS THE KEY OF THIS BUREAU
THE PROFESSOR KEEPS IT ON HIS WATCH CHAIN
IS IT A SIMPLE KEY
NO SIR IT IS A CHUBB'S KEY
VERY GOOD
MRS
MARKER YOU CAN GO
NOW WE ARE MAKING A LITTLE
PROGRESS
OUR LADY ENTERS THE ROOM ADVANCES TO THE BUREAU AND EITHER
OPENS IT OR TRIES TO DO SO
WHILE SHE IS THUS ENGAGED YOUNG WILLOUGHBY
SMITH ENTERS THE ROOM
IN HER HURRY TO WITHDRAW THE KEY SHE MAKES THIS
SCRATCH UPON THE DOOR
HE SEIZES HER AND SHE SNATCHING UP THE NEAREST
OBJECT WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THIS KNIFE STRIKES AT HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE
HIM LET GO HIS HOLD
THE BLOW IS A FATAL ONE
HE FALLS AND SHE ESCAPES
EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT THE OBJECT FOR WHICH SHE HAS COME
IS SUSAN THE
MAID THERE COULD ANYONE HAVE GOT AWAY THROUGH THAT DOOR AFTER THE TIME
THAT YOU HEARD THE CRY SUSAN
NO SIR IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
BEFORE I GOT DOWN THE STAIR I'D HAVE SEEN
ANYONE IN THE PASSAGE
BESIDES THE DOOR NEVER OPENED OR I WOULD HAVE
HEARD IT
THAT SETTLES THIS EXIT
THEN NO DOUBT THE LADY WENT OUT THE WAY SHE
CAME
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS OTHER PASSAGE LEADS ONLY TO THE PROFESSOR'S
ROOM
THERE IS NO EXIT THAT WAY
NO SIR
WE SHALL GO DOWN IT AND MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE PROFESSOR
HALLOA
HOPKINS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT INDEED
THE PROFESSOR'S
CORRIDOR IS ALSO LINED WITH COCOANUT MATTING
WELL SIR WHAT OF THAT
DON'T YOU SEE ANY BEARING UPON THE CASE WELL WELL
I DON'T INSIST
UPON IT
NO DOUBT I AM WRONG
AND YET IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE SUGGESTIVE
COME WITH ME AND INTRODUCE ME
WE PASSED DOWN THE PASSAGE WHICH WAS OF THE SAME LENGTH AS THAT WHICH
LED TO THE GARDEN
AT THE END WAS A SHORT FLIGHT OF STEPS ENDING IN
A DOOR
OUR GUIDE KNOCKED AND THEN USHERED US INTO THE PROFESSOR'S
BEDROOM
IT WAS A VERY LARGE CHAMBER LINED WITH INNUMERABLE VOLUMES WHICH HAD
OVERFLOWED FROM THE SHELVES AND LAY IN PILES IN THE CORNERS OR WERE
STACKED ALL ROUND AT THE BASE OF THE CASES
THE BED WAS IN THE CENTRE
OF THE ROOM AND IN IT PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS WAS THE OWNER OF THE
HOUSE
I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A MORE REMARKABLE LOOKING PERSON
IT WAS A
GAUNT AQUILINE FACE WHICH WAS TURNED TOWARDS US WITH PIERCING DARK
EYES WHICH LURKED IN DEEP HOLLOWS UNDER OVERHUNG AND TUFTED BROWS
HIS
HAIR AND BEARD WERE WHITE SAVE THAT THE LATTER WAS CURIOUSLY STAINED
WITH YELLOW AROUND HIS MOUTH
A CIGARETTE GLOWED AMID THE TANGLE OF
WHITE HAIR AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM WAS FETID WITH STALE TOBACCO SMOKE
AS HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO HOLMES I PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS ALSO STAINED
WITH YELLOW NICOTINE
A SMOKER MR
HOLMES SAID HE SPEAKING IN WELL CHOSEN ENGLISH WITH
A CURIOUS LITTLE MINCING ACCENT
PRAY TAKE A CIGARETTE
AND YOU SIR
I CAN RECOMMEND THEM FOR I HAVE THEM ESPECIALLY PREPARED BY IONIDES OF
ALEXANDRIA
HE SENDS ME A THOUSAND AT A TIME AND I GRIEVE TO SAY THAT I
HAVE TO ARRANGE FOR A FRESH SUPPLY EVERY FORTNIGHT
BAD SIR VERY BAD
BUT AN OLD MAN HAS FEW PLEASURES
TOBACCO AND MY WORK THAT IS ALL THAT
IS LEFT TO ME
HOLMES HAD LIT A CIGARETTE AND WAS SHOOTING LITTLE DARTING GLANCES ALL
OVER THE ROOM
TOBACCO AND MY WORK BUT NOW ONLY TOBACCO THE OLD MAN EXCLAIMED
ALAS WHAT A FATAL INTERRUPTION WHO COULD HAVE FORESEEN SUCH A
TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE SO ESTIMABLE A YOUNG MAN I ASSURE YOU THAT AFTER
A FEW MONTHS' TRAINING HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE ASSISTANT
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE MATTER MR
HOLMES
I HAVE NOT YET MADE UP MY MIND
I SHALL INDEED BE INDEBTED TO YOU IF YOU CAN THROW A LIGHT WHERE ALL IS
SO DARK TO US
TO A POOR BOOKWORM AND INVALID LIKE MYSELF SUCH A BLOW
IS PARALYZING
I SEEM TO HAVE LOST THE FACULTY OF THOUGHT
BUT YOU ARE
A MAN OF ACTION YOU ARE A MAN OF AFFAIRS
IT IS PART OF THE EVERYDAY
ROUTINE OF YOUR LIFE
YOU CAN PRESERVE YOUR BALANCE IN EVERY EMERGENCY
WE ARE FORTUNATE INDEED IN HAVING YOU AT OUR SIDE
HOLMES WAS PACING UP AND DOWN ONE SIDE OF THE ROOM WHILST THE OLD
PROFESSOR WAS TALKING
I OBSERVED THAT HE WAS SMOKING WITH EXTRAORDINARY
RAPIDITY
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SHARED OUR HOST'S LIKING FOR THE FRESH
ALEXANDRIAN CIGARETTES
YES SIR IT IS A CRUSHING BLOW SAID THE OLD MAN
THAT IS MY MAGNUM
OPUS THE PILE OF PAPERS ON THE SIDE TABLE YONDER
IT IS MY ANALYSIS OF
THE DOCUMENTS FOUND IN THE COPTIC MONASTERIES OF SYRIA AND EGYPT A WORK
WHICH WILL CUT DEEP AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF REVEALED RELIGION
WITH MY
ENFEEBLED HEALTH I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I SHALL EVER BE ABLE TO COMPLETE
IT NOW THAT MY ASSISTANT HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME
DEAR ME MR
HOLMES
WHY YOU ARE EVEN A QUICKER SMOKER THAN I AM MYSELF
HOLMES SMILED
I AM A CONNOISSEUR SAID HE TAKING ANOTHER CIGARETTE FROM THE
BOX HIS FOURTH AND LIGHTING IT FROM THE STUB OF THAT WHICH HE HAD
FINISHED
I WILL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH ANY LENGTHY CROSS EXAMINATION
PROFESSOR CORAM SINCE I GATHER THAT YOU WERE IN BED AT THE TIME OF THE
CRIME AND COULD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
I WOULD ONLY ASK THIS WHAT
DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS POOR FELLOW MEANT BY HIS LAST WORDS 'THE
PROFESSOR IT WAS SHE'
THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
SUSAN IS A COUNTRY GIRL SAID HE AND YOU KNOW THE INCREDIBLE
STUPIDITY OF THAT CLASS
I FANCY THAT THE POOR FELLOW MURMURED SOME
INCOHERENT DELIRIOUS WORDS AND THAT SHE TWISTED THEM INTO THIS
MEANINGLESS MESSAGE
I SEE
YOU HAVE NO EXPLANATION YOURSELF OF THE TRAGEDY
POSSIBLY AN ACCIDENT POSSIBLY I ONLY BREATHE IT AMONG OURSELVES A
SUICIDE
YOUNG MEN HAVE THEIR HIDDEN TROUBLES SOME AFFAIR OF THE HEART
PERHAPS WHICH WE HAVE NEVER KNOWN
IT IS A MORE PROBABLE SUPPOSITION
THAN MURDER
BUT THE EYEGLASSES
AH I AM ONLY A STUDENT A MAN OF DREAMS
I CANNOT EXPLAIN THE
PRACTICAL THINGS OF LIFE
BUT STILL WE ARE AWARE MY FRIEND THAT
LOVE GAGES MAY TAKE STRANGE SHAPES
BY ALL MEANS TAKE ANOTHER CIGARETTE
IT IS A PLEASURE TO SEE ANYONE APPRECIATE THEM SO
A FAN A GLOVE
GLASSES WHO KNOWS WHAT ARTICLE MAY BE CARRIED AS A TOKEN OR TREASURED
WHEN A MAN PUTS AN END TO HIS LIFE THIS GENTLEMAN SPEAKS OF FOOTSTEPS
IN THE GRASS BUT AFTER ALL IT IS EASY TO BE MISTAKEN ON SUCH A POINT
AS TO THE KNIFE IT MIGHT WELL BE THROWN FAR FROM THE UNFORTUNATE MAN AS
HE FELL
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I SPEAK AS A CHILD BUT TO ME IT SEEMS THAT
WILLOUGHBY SMITH HAS MET HIS FATE BY HIS OWN HAND
HOLMES SEEMED STRUCK BY THE THEORY THUS PUT FORWARD AND HE CONTINUED TO
WALK UP AND DOWN FOR SOME TIME LOST IN THOUGHT AND CONSUMING CIGARETTE
AFTER CIGARETTE
TELL ME PROFESSOR CORAM HE SAID AT LAST WHAT IS IN THAT CUPBOARD
IN THE BUREAU
NOTHING THAT WOULD HELP A THIEF
FAMILY PAPERS LETTERS FROM MY POOR
WIFE DIPLOMAS OF UNIVERSITIES WHICH HAVE DONE ME HONOUR
HERE IS THE
KEY
YOU CAN LOOK FOR YOURSELF
HOLMES PICKED UP THE KEY AND LOOKED AT IT FOR AN INSTANT THEN HE
HANDED IT BACK
NO I HARDLY THINK THAT IT WOULD HELP ME SAID HE
I SHOULD PREFER
TO GO QUIETLY DOWN TO YOUR GARDEN AND TURN THE WHOLE MATTER OVER IN MY
HEAD
THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THE THEORY OF SUICIDE WHICH
YOU HAVE PUT FORWARD
WE MUST APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING INTRUDED UPON YOU
PROFESSOR CORAM AND I PROMISE THAT WE WON'T DISTURB YOU UNTIL AFTER
LUNCH
AT TWO O'CLOCK WE WILL COME AGAIN AND REPORT TO YOU ANYTHING
WHICH MAY HAVE HAPPENED IN THE INTERVAL
HOLMES WAS CURIOUSLY DISTRAIT AND WE WALKED UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN PATH
FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE
HAVE YOU A CLUE I ASKED AT LAST
IT DEPENDS UPON THOSE CIGARETTES THAT I SMOKED SAID HE
IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT I AM UTTERLY MISTAKEN
THE CIGARETTES WILL SHOW ME
MY DEAR HOLMES I EXCLAIMED HOW ON EARTH
WELL WELL YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELF
IF NOT THERE'S NO HARM DONE
OF
COURSE WE ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTICIAN CLUE TO FALL BACK UPON BUT I TAKE
A SHORT CUT WHEN I CAN GET IT
AH HERE IS THE GOOD MRS
MARKER LET US
ENJOY FIVE MINUTES OF INSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH HER
I MAY HAVE REMARKED BEFORE THAT HOLMES HAD WHEN HE LIKED A PECULIARLY
INGRATIATING WAY WITH WOMEN AND THAT HE VERY READILY ESTABLISHED TERMS
OF CONFIDENCE WITH THEM
IN HALF THE TIME WHICH HE HAD NAMED HE HAD
CAPTURED THE HOUSEKEEPER'S GOODWILL AND WAS CHATTING WITH HER AS IF HE
HAD KNOWN HER FOR YEARS
YES MR
HOLMES IT IS AS YOU SAY SIR
HE DOES SMOKE SOMETHING
TERRIBLE
ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT SIR
I'VE SEEN THAT ROOM OF
A MORNING WELL SIR YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS A LONDON FOG
POOR YOUNG
MR
SMITH HE WAS A SMOKER ALSO BUT NOT AS BAD AS THE PROFESSOR
HIS
HEALTH WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S BETTER NOR WORSE FOR THE SMOKING
AH SAID HOLMES BUT IT KILLS THE APPETITE
WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SIR
I SUPPOSE THE PROFESSOR EATS HARDLY ANYTHING
WELL HE IS VARIABLE
I'LL SAY THAT FOR HIM
I'LL WAGER HE TOOK NO BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND WON'T FACE HIS LUNCH
AFTER ALL THE CIGARETTES I SAW HIM CONSUME
WELL YOU'RE OUT THERE SIR AS IT HAPPENS FOR HE ATE A REMARKABLE BIG
BREAKFAST THIS MORNING
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'VE KNOWN HIM MAKE A
BETTER ONE AND HE'S ORDERED A GOOD DISH OF CUTLETS FOR HIS LUNCH
I'M
SURPRISED MYSELF FOR SINCE I CAME INTO THAT ROOM YESTERDAY AND SAW
YOUNG MR
SMITH LYING THERE ON THE FLOOR I COULDN'T BEAR TO LOOK AT
FOOD
WELL IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD AND THE PROFESSOR HASN'T
LET IT TAKE HIS APPETITE AWAY
WE LOITERED THE MORNING AWAY IN THE GARDEN
STANLEY HOPKINS HAD GONE
DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO LOOK INTO SOME RUMOURS OF A STRANGE WOMAN WHO HAD
BEEN SEEN BY SOME CHILDREN ON THE CHATHAM ROAD THE PREVIOUS MORNING
AS
TO MY FRIEND ALL HIS USUAL ENERGY SEEMED TO HAVE DESERTED HIM
I HAD
NEVER KNOWN HIM HANDLE A CASE IN SUCH A HALF HEARTED FASHION
EVEN THE
NEWS BROUGHT BACK BY HOPKINS THAT HE HAD FOUND THE CHILDREN AND THAT
THEY HAD UNDOUBTEDLY SEEN A WOMAN EXACTLY CORRESPONDING WITH HOLMES'S
DESCRIPTION AND WEARING EITHER SPECTACLES OR EYEGLASSES FAILED TO
ROUSE ANY SIGN OF KEEN INTEREST
HE WAS MORE ATTENTIVE WHEN SUSAN WHO
WAITED UPON US AT LUNCH VOLUNTEERED THE INFORMATION THAT SHE BELIEVED
MR
SMITH HAD BEEN OUT FOR A WALK YESTERDAY MORNING AND THAT HE HAD
ONLY RETURNED HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE TRAGEDY OCCURRED
I COULD NOT
MYSELF SEE THE BEARING OF THIS INCIDENT BUT I CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT
HOLMES WAS WEAVING IT INTO THE GENERAL SCHEME WHICH HE HAD FORMED IN HIS
BRAIN
SUDDENLY HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND GLANCED AT HIS WATCH
TWO
O'CLOCK GENTLEMEN SAID HE
WE MUST GO UP AND HAVE IT OUT WITH OUR
FRIEND THE PROFESSOR
THE OLD MAN HAD JUST FINISHED HIS LUNCH AND CERTAINLY HIS EMPTY DISH
BORE EVIDENCE TO THE GOOD APPETITE WITH WHICH HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD
CREDITED HIM
HE WAS INDEED A WEIRD FIGURE AS HE TURNED HIS WHITE MANE
AND HIS GLOWING EYES TOWARDS US
THE ETERNAL CIGARETTE SMOULDERED IN HIS
MOUTH
HE HAD BEEN DRESSED AND WAS SEATED IN AN ARMCHAIR BY THE FIRE
WELL MR
HOLMES HAVE YOU SOLVED THIS MYSTERY YET HE SHOVED THE
LARGE TIN OF CIGARETTES WHICH STOOD ON A TABLE BESIDE HIM TOWARDS MY
COMPANION
HOLMES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AT THE SAME MOMENT AND BETWEEN
THEM THEY TIPPED THE BOX OVER THE EDGE
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO WE WERE ALL
ON OUR KNEES RETRIEVING STRAY CIGARETTES FROM IMPOSSIBLE PLACES
WHEN WE
ROSE AGAIN I OBSERVED HOLMES'S EYES WERE SHINING AND HIS CHEEKS TINGED
WITH COLOUR
ONLY AT A CRISIS HAVE I SEEN THOSE BATTLE SIGNALS FLYING
YES SAID HE I HAVE SOLVED IT
STANLEY HOPKINS AND I STARED IN AMAZEMENT
SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER
QUIVERED OVER THE GAUNT FEATURES OF THE OLD PROFESSOR
INDEED IN THE GARDEN
NO HERE
HERE WHEN
THIS INSTANT
YOU ARE SURELY JOKING MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
YOU COMPEL ME TO TELL YOU
THAT THIS IS TOO SERIOUS A MATTER TO BE TREATED IN SUCH A FASHION
I HAVE FORGED AND TESTED EVERY LINK OF MY CHAIN PROFESSOR CORAM AND I
AM SURE THAT IT IS SOUND
WHAT YOUR MOTIVES ARE OR WHAT EXACT PART
YOU PLAY IN THIS STRANGE BUSINESS I AM NOT YET ABLE TO SAY
IN A FEW
MINUTES I SHALL PROBABLY HEAR IT FROM YOUR OWN LIPS
MEANWHILE I WILL
RECONSTRUCT WHAT IS PAST FOR YOUR BENEFIT SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE
INFORMATION WHICH I STILL REQUIRE
A LADY YESTERDAY ENTERED YOUR STUDY
SHE CAME WITH THE INTENTION OF
POSSESSING HERSELF OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS WHICH WERE IN YOUR BUREAU
SHE
HAD A KEY OF HER OWN
I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING YOURS AND
I DO NOT FIND THAT SLIGHT DISCOLOURATION WHICH THE SCRATCH MADE UPON THE
VARNISH WOULD HAVE PRODUCED
YOU WERE NOT AN ACCESSORY THEREFORE AND
SHE CAME SO FAR AS I CAN READ THE EVIDENCE WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE TO
ROB YOU
THE PROFESSOR BLEW A CLOUD FROM HIS LIPS
THIS IS MOST INTERESTING AND
INSTRUCTIVE SAID HE
HAVE YOU NO MORE TO ADD SURELY HAVING TRACED
THIS LADY SO FAR YOU CAN ALSO SAY WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER
I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO DO SO
IN THE FIRST PLACE SHE WAS SEIZED BY YOUR
SECRETARY AND STABBED HIM IN ORDER TO ESCAPE
THIS CATASTROPHE I AM
INCLINED TO REGARD AS AN UNHAPPY ACCIDENT FOR I AM CONVINCED THAT THE
LADY HAD NO INTENTION OF INFLICTING SO GRIEVOUS AN INJURY
AN ASSASSIN
DOES NOT COME UNARMED
HORRIFIED BY WHAT SHE HAD DONE SHE RUSHED WILDLY
AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF THE TRAGEDY
UNFORTUNATELY FOR HER SHE HAD LOST
HER GLASSES IN THE SCUFFLE AND AS SHE WAS EXTREMELY SHORT SIGHTED SHE
WAS REALLY HELPLESS WITHOUT THEM
SHE RAN DOWN A CORRIDOR WHICH SHE
IMAGINED TO BE THAT BY WHICH SHE HAD COME BOTH WERE LINED WITH COCOANUT
MATTING AND IT WAS ONLY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT
SHE HAD TAKEN THE WRONG PASSAGE AND THAT HER RETREAT WAS CUT OFF BEHIND
HER
WHAT WAS SHE TO DO SHE COULD NOT GO BACK
SHE COULD NOT REMAIN
WHERE SHE WAS
SHE MUST GO ON
SHE WENT ON
SHE MOUNTED A STAIR PUSHED
OPEN A DOOR AND FOUND HERSELF IN YOUR ROOM
THE OLD MAN SAT WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN STARING WILDLY AT HOLMES
AMAZEMENT
AND FEAR WERE STAMPED UPON HIS EXPRESSIVE FEATURES
NOW WITH AN EFFORT
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND BURST INTO INSINCERE LAUGHTER
ALL VERY FINE MR
HOLMES SAID HE
BUT THERE IS ONE LITTLE FLAW
IN YOUR SPLENDID THEORY
I WAS MYSELF IN MY ROOM AND I NEVER LEFT IT
DURING THE DAY
I AM AWARE OF THAT PROFESSOR CORAM
AND YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT I COULD LIE UPON THAT BED AND NOT BE AWARE
THAT A WOMAN HAD ENTERED MY ROOM
I NEVER SAID SO
YOU WERE AWARE OF IT
YOU SPOKE WITH HER
YOU
RECOGNIZED HER
YOU AIDED HER TO ESCAPE
AGAIN THE PROFESSOR BURST INTO HIGH KEYED LAUGHTER
HE HAD RISEN TO HIS
FEET AND HIS EYES GLOWED LIKE EMBERS
YOU ARE MAD HE CRIED
YOU ARE TALKING INSANELY
I HELPED HER TO
ESCAPE WHERE IS SHE NOW
SHE IS THERE SAID HOLMES AND HE POINTED TO A HIGH BOOKCASE IN THE
CORNER OF THE ROOM
I SAW THE OLD MAN THROW UP HIS ARMS A TERRIBLE CONVULSION PASSED OVER
HIS GRIM FACE AND HE FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR
AT THE SAME INSTANT THE
BOOKCASE AT WHICH HOLMES POINTED SWUNG ROUND UPON A HINGE AND A WOMAN
RUSHED OUT INTO THE ROOM
YOU ARE RIGHT SHE CRIED IN A STRANGE
FOREIGN VOICE
YOU ARE RIGHT I AM HERE
SHE WAS BROWN WITH THE DUST AND DRAPED WITH THE COBWEBS WHICH HAD COME
FROM THE WALLS OF HER HIDING PLACE
HER FACE TOO WAS STREAKED WITH
GRIME AND AT THE BEST SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN HANDSOME FOR SHE HAD
THE EXACT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH HOLMES HAD DIVINED WITH IN
ADDITION A LONG AND OBSTINATE CHIN
WHAT WITH HER NATURAL BLINDNESS
AND WHAT WITH THE CHANGE FROM DARK TO LIGHT SHE STOOD AS ONE DAZED
BLINKING ABOUT HER TO SEE WHERE AND WHO WE WERE
AND YET IN SPITE OF
ALL THESE DISADVANTAGES THERE WAS A CERTAIN NOBILITY IN THE WOMAN'S
BEARING A GALLANTRY IN THE DEFIANT CHIN AND IN THE UPRAISED HEAD WHICH
COMPELLED SOMETHING OF RESPECT AND ADMIRATION
STANLEY HOPKINS HAD LAID HIS HAND UPON HER ARM AND CLAIMED HER AS HIS
PRISONER BUT SHE WAVED HIM ASIDE GENTLY AND YET WITH AN OVER MASTERING
DIGNITY WHICH COMPELLED OBEDIENCE
THE OLD MAN LAY BACK IN HIS CHAIR
WITH A TWITCHING FACE AND STARED AT HER WITH BROODING EYES
YES SIR I AM YOUR PRISONER SHE SAID
FROM WHERE I STOOD I COULD
HEAR EVERYTHING AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED THE TRUTH
I CONFESS
IT ALL
IT WAS I WHO KILLED THE YOUNG MAN
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT YOU WHO
SAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT IT WAS A KNIFE WHICH
I HELD IN MY HAND FOR IN MY DESPAIR I SNATCHED ANYTHING FROM THE TABLE
AND STRUCK AT HIM TO MAKE HIM LET ME GO
IT IS THE TRUTH THAT I TELL
MADAM SAID HOLMES I AM SURE THAT IT IS THE TRUTH
I FEAR THAT YOU
ARE FAR FROM WELL
SHE HAD TURNED A DREADFUL COLOUR THE MORE GHASTLY UNDER THE DARK
DUST STREAKS UPON HER FACE
SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SIDE OF THE BED
THEN SHE RESUMED
I HAVE ONLY A LITTLE TIME HERE SHE SAID BUT I WOULD HAVE YOU TO
KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH
I AM THIS MAN'S WIFE
HE IS NOT AN ENGLISHMAN
HE
IS A RUSSIAN
HIS NAME I WILL NOT TELL
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OLD MAN STIRRED
GOD BLESS YOU ANNA HE CRIED
GOD BLESS YOU
SHE CAST A LOOK OF THE DEEPEST DISDAIN IN HIS DIRECTION
WHY SHOULD YOU
CLING SO HARD TO THAT WRETCHED LIFE OF YOURS SERGIUS SAID SHE
IT
HAS DONE HARM TO MANY AND GOOD TO NONE NOT EVEN TO YOURSELF
HOWEVER
IT IS NOT FOR ME TO CAUSE THE FRAIL THREAD TO BE SNAPPED BEFORE GOD'S
TIME
I HAVE ENOUGH ALREADY UPON MY SOUL SINCE I CROSSED THE THRESHOLD
OF THIS CURSED HOUSE
BUT I MUST SPEAK OR I SHALL BE TOO LATE
I HAVE SAID GENTLEMEN THAT I AM THIS MAN'S WIFE
HE WAS FIFTY AND I
A FOOLISH GIRL OF TWENTY WHEN WE MARRIED
IT WAS IN A CITY OF RUSSIA A
UNIVERSITY I WILL NOT NAME THE PLACE
GOD BLESS YOU ANNA MURMURED THE OLD MAN AGAIN
WE WERE REFORMERS REVOLUTIONISTS NIHILISTS YOU UNDERSTAND
HE AND I
AND MANY MORE
THEN THERE CAME A TIME OF TROUBLE A POLICE OFFICER WAS
KILLED MANY WERE ARRESTED EVIDENCE WAS WANTED AND IN ORDER TO SAVE
HIS OWN LIFE AND TO EARN A GREAT REWARD MY HUSBAND BETRAYED HIS OWN
WIFE AND HIS COMPANIONS
YES WE WERE ALL ARRESTED UPON HIS CONFESSION
SOME OF US FOUND OUR WAY TO THE GALLOWS AND SOME TO SIBERIA
I WAS
AMONG THESE LAST BUT MY TERM WAS NOT FOR LIFE
MY HUSBAND CAME TO
ENGLAND WITH HIS ILL GOTTEN GAINS AND HAS LIVED IN QUIET EVER SINCE
KNOWING WELL THAT IF THE BROTHERHOOD KNEW WHERE HE WAS NOT A WEEK WOULD
PASS BEFORE JUSTICE WOULD BE DONE
THE OLD MAN REACHED OUT A TREMBLING HAND AND HELPED HIMSELF TO A
CIGARETTE
I AM IN YOUR HANDS ANNA SAID HE
YOU WERE ALWAYS GOOD TO
ME
I HAVE NOT YET TOLD YOU THE HEIGHT OF HIS VILLAINY SAID SHE
AMONG
OUR COMRADES OF THE ORDER THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS THE FRIEND OF MY HEART
HE WAS NOBLE UNSELFISH LOVING ALL THAT MY HUSBAND WAS NOT
HE HATED
VIOLENCE
WE WERE ALL GUILTY IF THAT IS GUILT BUT HE WAS NOT
HE WROTE
FOREVER DISSUADING US FROM SUCH A COURSE
THESE LETTERS WOULD HAVE SAVED
HIM
SO WOULD MY DIARY IN WHICH FROM DAY TO DAY I HAD ENTERED BOTH MY
FEELINGS TOWARDS HIM AND THE VIEW WHICH EACH OF US HAD TAKEN
MY HUSBAND
FOUND AND KEPT BOTH DIARY AND LETTERS
HE HID THEM AND HE TRIED HARD TO
SWEAR AWAY THE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE
IN THIS HE FAILED BUT ALEXIS WAS SENT
A CONVICT TO SIBERIA WHERE NOW AT THIS MOMENT HE WORKS IN A SALT
MINE
THINK OF THAT YOU VILLAIN YOU VILLAIN NOW NOW AT THIS VERY
MOMENT ALEXIS A MAN WHOSE NAME YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO SPEAK WORKS AND
LIVES LIKE A SLAVE AND YET I HAVE YOUR LIFE IN MY HANDS AND I LET YOU
GO
YOU WERE ALWAYS A NOBLE WOMAN ANNA SAID THE OLD MAN PUFFING AT HIS
CIGARETTE
SHE HAD RISEN BUT SHE FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A LITTLE CRY OF PAIN
I MUST FINISH SHE SAID
WHEN MY TERM WAS OVER I SET MYSELF TO GET
THE DIARY AND LETTERS WHICH IF SENT TO THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD
PROCURE MY FRIEND'S RELEASE
I KNEW THAT MY HUSBAND HAD COME TO ENGLAND
AFTER MONTHS OF SEARCHING I DISCOVERED WHERE HE WAS
I KNEW THAT HE
STILL HAD THE DIARY FOR WHEN I WAS IN SIBERIA I HAD A LETTER FROM HIM
ONCE REPROACHING ME AND QUOTING SOME PASSAGES FROM ITS PAGES
YET I WAS
SURE THAT WITH HIS REVENGEFUL NATURE HE WOULD NEVER GIVE IT TO ME OF
HIS OWN FREE WILL
I MUST GET IT FOR MYSELF
WITH THIS OBJECT I ENGAGED
AN AGENT FROM A PRIVATE DETECTIVE FIRM WHO ENTERED MY HUSBAND'S HOUSE
AS A SECRETARY IT WAS YOUR SECOND SECRETARY SERGIUS THE ONE WHO LEFT
YOU SO HURRIEDLY
HE FOUND THAT PAPERS WERE KEPT IN THE CUPBOARD AND HE
GOT AN IMPRESSION OF THE KEY
HE WOULD NOT GO FARTHER
HE FURNISHED ME
WITH A PLAN OF THE HOUSE AND HE TOLD ME THAT IN THE FORENOON THE STUDY
WAS ALWAYS EMPTY AS THE SECRETARY WAS EMPLOYED UP HERE
SO AT LAST I
TOOK MY COURAGE IN BOTH HANDS AND I CAME DOWN TO GET THE PAPERS FOR
MYSELF
I SUCCEEDED BUT AT WHAT A COST
I HAD JUST TAKEN THE PAPER AND WAS LOCKING THE CUPBOARD WHEN THE
YOUNG MAN SEIZED ME
I HAD SEEN HIM ALREADY THAT MORNING
HE HAD MET ME
ON THE ROAD AND I HAD ASKED HIM TO TELL ME WHERE PROFESSOR CORAM LIVED
NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS IN HIS EMPLOY
EXACTLY EXACTLY SAID HOLMES
THE SECRETARY CAME BACK AND TOLD HIS
EMPLOYER OF THE WOMAN HE HAD MET
THEN IN HIS LAST BREATH HE TRIED TO
SEND A MESSAGE THAT IT WAS SHE THE SHE WHOM HE HAD JUST DISCUSSED WITH
HIM
YOU MUST LET ME SPEAK SAID THE WOMAN IN AN IMPERATIVE VOICE AND
HER FACE CONTRACTED AS IF IN PAIN
WHEN HE HAD FALLEN I RUSHED FROM THE
ROOM CHOSE THE WRONG DOOR AND FOUND MYSELF IN MY HUSBAND'S ROOM
HE
SPOKE OF GIVING ME UP
I SHOWED HIM THAT IF HE DID SO HIS LIFE WAS IN
MY HANDS
IF HE GAVE ME TO THE LAW I COULD GIVE HIM TO THE BROTHERHOOD
IT WAS NOT THAT I WISHED TO LIVE FOR MY OWN SAKE BUT IT WAS THAT
I DESIRED TO ACCOMPLISH MY PURPOSE
HE KNEW THAT I WOULD DO WHAT I
SAID THAT HIS OWN FATE WAS INVOLVED IN MINE
FOR THAT REASON AND FOR
NO OTHER HE SHIELDED ME
HE THRUST ME INTO THAT DARK HIDING PLACE A
RELIC OF OLD DAYS KNOWN ONLY TO HIMSELF
HE TOOK HIS MEALS IN HIS OWN
ROOM AND SO WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME PART OF HIS FOOD
IT WAS AGREED THAT
WHEN THE POLICE LEFT THE HOUSE I SHOULD SLIP AWAY BY NIGHT AND COME BACK
NO MORE
BUT IN SOME WAY YOU HAVE READ OUR PLANS SHE TORE FROM THE
BOSOM OF HER DRESS A SMALL PACKET
THESE ARE MY LAST WORDS SAID SHE
HERE IS THE PACKET WHICH WILL SAVE ALEXIS
I CONFIDE IT TO YOUR HONOUR
AND TO YOUR LOVE OF JUSTICE
TAKE IT YOU WILL DELIVER IT AT THE RUSSIAN
EMBASSY
NOW I HAVE DONE MY DUTY AND
STOP HER CRIED HOLMES
HE HAD BOUNDED ACROSS THE ROOM AND HAD
WRENCHED A SMALL PHIAL FROM HER HAND
TOO LATE SHE SAID SINKING BACK ON THE BED
TOO LATE I TOOK THE
POISON BEFORE I LEFT MY HIDING PLACE
MY HEAD SWIMS I AM GOING I
CHARGE YOU SIR TO REMEMBER THE PACKET
A SIMPLE CASE AND YET IN SOME WAYS AN INSTRUCTIVE ONE HOLMES
REMARKED AS WE TRAVELLED BACK TO TOWN
IT HINGED FROM THE OUTSET UPON
THE PINCE NEZ
BUT FOR THE FORTUNATE CHANCE OF THE DYING MAN HAVING
SEIZED THESE I AM NOT SURE THAT WE COULD EVER HAVE REACHED OUR
SOLUTION
IT WAS CLEAR TO ME FROM THE STRENGTH OF THE GLASSES THAT
THE WEARER MUST HAVE BEEN VERY BLIND AND HELPLESS WHEN DEPRIVED OF THEM
WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WALKED ALONG A NARROW STRIP OF
GRASS WITHOUT ONCE MAKING A FALSE STEP I REMARKED AS YOU MAY REMEMBER
THAT IT WAS A NOTEWORTHY PERFORMANCE
IN MY MIND I SET IT DOWN AS AN
IMPOSSIBLE PERFORMANCE SAVE IN THE UNLIKELY CASE THAT SHE HAD A SECOND
PAIR OF GLASSES
I WAS FORCED THEREFORE TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY THE
HYPOTHESIS THAT SHE HAD REMAINED WITHIN THE HOUSE
ON PERCEIVING THE
SIMILARITY OF THE TWO CORRIDORS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SHE MIGHT VERY
EASILY HAVE MADE SUCH A MISTAKE AND IN THAT CASE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT
SHE MUST HAVE ENTERED THE PROFESSOR'S ROOM
I WAS KEENLY ON THE ALERT
THEREFORE FOR WHATEVER WOULD BEAR OUT THIS SUPPOSITION AND I EXAMINED
THE ROOM NARROWLY FOR ANYTHING IN THE SHAPE OF A HIDING PLACE
THE
CARPET SEEMED CONTINUOUS AND FIRMLY NAILED SO I DISMISSED THE IDEA OF
A TRAP DOOR
THERE MIGHT WELL BE A RECESS BEHIND THE BOOKS
AS YOU ARE
AWARE SUCH DEVICES ARE COMMON IN OLD LIBRARIES
I OBSERVED THAT BOOKS
WERE PILED ON THE FLOOR AT ALL OTHER POINTS BUT THAT ONE BOOKCASE WAS
LEFT CLEAR
THIS THEN MIGHT BE THE DOOR
I COULD SEE NO MARKS TO GUIDE
ME BUT THE CARPET WAS OF A DUN COLOUR WHICH LENDS ITSELF VERY WELL
TO EXAMINATION
I THEREFORE SMOKED A GREAT NUMBER OF THOSE EXCELLENT
CIGARETTES AND I DROPPED THE ASH ALL OVER THE SPACE IN FRONT OF THE
SUSPECTED BOOKCASE
IT WAS A SIMPLE TRICK BUT EXCEEDINGLY EFFECTIVE
I THEN WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND I ASCERTAINED IN YOUR PRESENCE WATSON
WITHOUT YOUR PERCEIVING THE DRIFT OF MY REMARKS THAT PROFESSOR CORAM'S
CONSUMPTION OF FOOD HAD INCREASED AS ONE WOULD EXPECT WHEN HE IS
SUPPLYING A SECOND PERSON
WE THEN ASCENDED TO THE ROOM AGAIN WHEN
BY UPSETTING THE CIGARETTE BOX I OBTAINED A VERY EXCELLENT VIEW OF
THE FLOOR AND WAS ABLE TO SEE QUITE CLEARLY FROM THE TRACES UPON THE
CIGARETTE ASH THAT THE PRISONER HAD IN OUR ABSENCE COME OUT FROM HER
RETREAT
WELL HOPKINS HERE WE ARE AT CHARING CROSS AND I CONGRATULATE
YOU ON HAVING BROUGHT YOUR CASE TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION
YOU ARE
GOING TO HEADQUARTERS NO DOUBT
I THINK WATSON YOU AND I WILL DRIVE
TOGETHER TO THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY
THE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE QUARTER
WE WERE FAIRLY ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE WEIRD TELEGRAMS AT BAKER STREET
BUT I HAVE A PARTICULAR RECOLLECTION OF ONE WHICH REACHED US ON A GLOOMY
FEBRUARY MORNING SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO AND GAVE MR
SHERLOCK
HOLMES A PUZZLED QUARTER OF AN HOUR
IT WAS ADDRESSED TO HIM AND RAN
THUS
PLEASE AWAIT ME
TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE
RIGHT WING THREE QUARTER MISSING
INDISPENSABLE TO MORROW
OVERTON
STRAND POSTMARK AND DISPATCHED TEN THIRTY SIX SAID HOLMES READING
IT OVER AND OVER
MR
OVERTON WAS EVIDENTLY CONSIDERABLY EXCITED WHEN
HE SENT IT AND SOMEWHAT INCOHERENT IN CONSEQUENCE
WELL WELL HE WILL
BE HERE I DARESAY BY THE TIME I HAVE LOOKED THROUGH THE TIMES AND
THEN WE SHALL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
EVEN THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT PROBLEM
WOULD BE WELCOME IN THESE STAGNANT DAYS
THINGS HAD INDEED BEEN VERY SLOW WITH US AND I HAD LEARNED TO DREAD
SUCH PERIODS OF INACTION FOR I KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT MY COMPANION'S
BRAIN WAS SO ABNORMALLY ACTIVE THAT IT WAS DANGEROUS TO LEAVE IT WITHOUT
MATERIAL UPON WHICH TO WORK
FOR YEARS I HAD GRADUALLY WEANED HIM
FROM THAT DRUG MANIA WHICH HAD THREATENED ONCE TO CHECK HIS REMARKABLE
CAREER
NOW I KNEW THAT UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS HE NO LONGER CRAVED
FOR THIS ARTIFICIAL STIMULUS BUT I WAS WELL AWARE THAT THE FIEND WAS
NOT DEAD BUT SLEEPING AND I HAVE KNOWN THAT THE SLEEP WAS A LIGHT ONE
AND THE WAKING NEAR WHEN IN PERIODS OF IDLENESS I HAVE SEEN THE DRAWN
LOOK UPON HOLMES'S ASCETIC FACE AND THE BROODING OF HIS DEEP SET AND
INSCRUTABLE EYES
THEREFORE I BLESSED THIS MR
OVERTON WHOEVER HE MIGHT
BE SINCE HE HAD COME WITH HIS ENIGMATIC MESSAGE TO BREAK THAT DANGEROUS
CALM WHICH BROUGHT MORE PERIL TO MY FRIEND THAN ALL THE STORMS OF HIS
TEMPESTUOUS LIFE
AS WE HAD EXPECTED THE TELEGRAM WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY ITS SENDER AND
THE CARD OF MR
CYRIL OVERTON TRINITY COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE ANNOUNCED
THE ARRIVAL OF AN ENORMOUS YOUNG MAN SIXTEEN STONE OF SOLID BONE AND
MUSCLE WHO SPANNED THE DOORWAY WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND LOOKED
FROM ONE OF US TO THE OTHER WITH A COMELY FACE WHICH WAS HAGGARD WITH
ANXIETY
MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
MY COMPANION BOWED
I'VE BEEN DOWN TO SCOTLAND YARD MR
HOLMES
I SAW INSPECTOR STANLEY
HOPKINS
HE ADVISED ME TO COME TO YOU
HE SAID THE CASE SO FAR AS HE
COULD SEE WAS MORE IN YOUR LINE THAN IN THAT OF THE REGULAR POLICE
PRAY SIT DOWN AND TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER
IT'S AWFUL MR
HOLMES SIMPLY AWFUL I WONDER MY HAIR ISN'T GRAY
GODFREY STAUNTON YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM OF COURSE HE'S SIMPLY THE HINGE
THAT THE WHOLE TEAM TURNS ON
I'D RATHER SPARE TWO FROM THE PACK
AND HAVE GODFREY FOR MY THREE QUARTER LINE
WHETHER IT'S PASSING OR
TACKLING OR DRIBBLING THERE'S NO ONE TO TOUCH HIM AND THEN HE'S GOT
THE HEAD AND CAN HOLD US ALL TOGETHER
WHAT AM I TO DO THAT'S WHAT I
ASK YOU MR
HOLMES
THERE'S MOORHOUSE FIRST RESERVE BUT HE IS TRAINED
AS A HALF AND HE ALWAYS EDGES RIGHT IN ON TO THE SCRUM INSTEAD OF
KEEPING OUT ON THE TOUCHLINE
HE'S A FINE PLACE KICK IT'S TRUE BUT
THEN HE HAS NO JUDGMENT AND HE CAN'T SPRINT FOR NUTS
WHY MORTON OR
JOHNSON THE OXFORD FLIERS COULD ROMP ROUND HIM
STEVENSON IS
FAST ENOUGH BUT HE COULDN'T DROP FROM THE TWENTY FIVE LINE AND A
THREE QUARTER WHO CAN'T EITHER PUNT OR DROP ISN'T WORTH A PLACE FOR
PACE ALONE
NO MR
HOLMES WE ARE DONE UNLESS YOU CAN HELP ME TO FIND
GODFREY STAUNTON
MY FRIEND HAD LISTENED WITH AMUSED SURPRISE TO THIS LONG SPEECH WHICH
WAS POURED FORTH WITH EXTRAORDINARY VIGOUR AND EARNESTNESS EVERY POINT
BEING DRIVEN HOME BY THE SLAPPING OF A BRAWNY HAND UPON THE SPEAKER'S
KNEE
WHEN OUR VISITOR WAS SILENT HOLMES STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND TOOK
DOWN LETTER S OF HIS COMMONPLACE BOOK
FOR ONCE HE DUG IN VAIN INTO
THAT MINE OF VARIED INFORMATION
THERE IS ARTHUR H
STAUNTON THE RISING YOUNG FORGER SAID HE AND
THERE WAS HENRY STAUNTON WHOM I HELPED TO HANG BUT GODFREY STAUNTON IS
A NEW NAME TO ME
IT WAS OUR VISITOR'S TURN TO LOOK SURPRISED
WHY MR
HOLMES I THOUGHT YOU KNEW THINGS SAID HE
I SUPPOSE
THEN IF YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF GODFREY STAUNTON YOU DON'T KNOW CYRIL
OVERTON EITHER
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD GOOD HUMOUREDLY
GREAT SCOTT CRIED THE ATHLETE
WHY I WAS FIRST RESERVE FOR ENGLAND
AGAINST WALES AND I'VE SKIPPERED THE 'VARSITY ALL THIS YEAR
BUT THAT'S
NOTHING I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS A SOUL IN ENGLAND WHO DIDN'T KNOW
GODFREY STAUNTON THE CRACK THREE QUARTER CAMBRIDGE BLACKHEATH AND
FIVE INTERNATIONALS
GOOD LORD MR
HOLMES WHERE HAVE YOU LIVED
HOLMES LAUGHED AT THE YOUNG GIANT'S NAIVE ASTONISHMENT
YOU LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD TO ME MR
OVERTON A SWEETER AND
HEALTHIER ONE
MY RAMIFICATIONS STRETCH OUT INTO MANY SECTIONS OF
SOCIETY BUT NEVER I AM HAPPY TO SAY INTO AMATEUR SPORT WHICH IS THE
BEST AND SOUNDEST THING IN ENGLAND
HOWEVER YOUR UNEXPECTED VISIT THIS
MORNING SHOWS ME THAT EVEN IN THAT WORLD OF FRESH AIR AND FAIR PLAY
THERE MAY BE WORK FOR ME TO DO
SO NOW MY GOOD SIR I BEG YOU TO SIT
DOWN AND TO TELL ME SLOWLY AND QUIETLY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THAT HAS
OCCURRED AND HOW YOU DESIRE THAT I SHOULD HELP YOU
YOUNG OVERTON'S FACE ASSUMED THE BOTHERED LOOK OF THE MAN WHO IS MORE
ACCUSTOMED TO USING HIS MUSCLES THAN HIS WITS BUT BY DEGREES WITH MANY
REPETITIONS AND OBSCURITIES WHICH I MAY OMIT FROM HIS NARRATIVE HE LAID
HIS STRANGE STORY BEFORE US
IT'S THIS WAY MR
HOLMES
AS I HAVE SAID I AM THE SKIPPER OF THE
RUGGER TEAM OF CAMBRIDGE 'VARSITY AND GODFREY STAUNTON IS MY BEST MAN
TO MORROW WE PLAY OXFORD
YESTERDAY WE ALL CAME UP AND WE SETTLED AT
BENTLEY'S PRIVATE HOTEL
AT TEN O'CLOCK I WENT ROUND AND SAW THAT ALL
THE FELLOWS HAD GONE TO ROOST FOR I BELIEVE IN STRICT TRAINING AND
PLENTY OF SLEEP TO KEEP A TEAM FIT
I HAD A WORD OR TWO WITH GODFREY
BEFORE HE TURNED IN
HE SEEMED TO ME TO BE PALE AND BOTHERED
I ASKED
HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER
HE SAID HE WAS ALL RIGHT JUST A TOUCH OF
HEADACHE
I BADE HIM GOOD NIGHT AND LEFT HIM
HALF AN HOUR LATER THE
PORTER TELLS ME THAT A ROUGH LOOKING MAN WITH A BEARD CALLED WITH A NOTE
FOR GODFREY
HE HAD NOT GONE TO BED AND THE NOTE WAS TAKEN TO HIS ROOM
GODFREY READ IT AND FELL BACK IN A CHAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN POLE AXED
THE PORTER WAS SO SCARED THAT HE WAS GOING TO FETCH ME BUT GODFREY
STOPPED HIM HAD A DRINK OF WATER AND PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER
THEN
HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE MAN WHO WAS WAITING IN THE
HALL AND THE TWO OF THEM WENT OFF TOGETHER
THE LAST THAT THE PORTER
SAW OF THEM THEY WERE ALMOST RUNNING DOWN THE STREET IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE STRAND
THIS MORNING GODFREY'S ROOM WAS EMPTY HIS BED HAD NEVER
BEEN SLEPT IN AND HIS THINGS WERE ALL JUST AS I HAD SEEN THEM THE NIGHT
BEFORE
HE HAD GONE OFF AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE WITH THIS STRANGER AND NO
WORD HAS COME FROM HIM SINCE
I DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL EVER COME BACK
HE
WAS A SPORTSMAN WAS GODFREY DOWN TO HIS MARROW AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE
STOPPED HIS TRAINING AND LET IN HIS SKIPPER IF IT WERE NOT FOR SOME
CAUSE THAT WAS TOO STRONG FOR HIM
NO I FEEL AS IF HE WERE GONE FOR
GOOD AND WE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
SHERLOCK HOLMES LISTENED WITH THE DEEPEST ATTENTION TO THIS SINGULAR
NARRATIVE
WHAT DID YOU DO HE ASKED
I WIRED TO CAMBRIDGE TO LEARN IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF HIM THERE
I HAVE HAD AN ANSWER
NO ONE HAS SEEN HIM
COULD HE HAVE GOT BACK TO CAMBRIDGE
YES THERE IS A LATE TRAIN QUARTER PAST ELEVEN
BUT SO FAR AS YOU CAN ASCERTAIN HE DID NOT TAKE IT
NO HE HAS NOT BEEN SEEN
WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT
I WIRED TO LORD MOUNT JAMES
WHY TO LORD MOUNT JAMES
GODFREY IS AN ORPHAN AND LORD MOUNT JAMES IS HIS NEAREST RELATIVE HIS
UNCLE I BELIEVE
INDEED
THIS THROWS NEW LIGHT UPON THE MATTER
LORD MOUNT JAMES IS ONE
OF THE RICHEST MEN IN ENGLAND
SO I'VE HEARD GODFREY SAY
AND YOUR FRIEND WAS CLOSELY RELATED
YES HE WAS HIS HEIR AND THE OLD BOY IS NEARLY EIGHTY CRAM FULL OF
GOUT TOO
THEY SAY HE COULD CHALK HIS BILLIARD CUE WITH HIS KNUCKLES
HE NEVER ALLOWED GODFREY A SHILLING IN HIS LIFE FOR HE IS AN ABSOLUTE
MISER BUT IT WILL ALL COME TO HIM RIGHT ENOUGH
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM LORD MOUNT JAMES
NO
WHAT MOTIVE COULD YOUR FRIEND HAVE IN GOING TO LORD MOUNT JAMES
WELL SOMETHING WAS WORRYING HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND IF IT WAS TO DO
WITH MONEY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD MAKE FOR HIS NEAREST RELATIVE
WHO HAD SO MUCH OF IT THOUGH FROM ALL I HAVE HEARD HE WOULD NOT HAVE
MUCH CHANCE OF GETTING IT
GODFREY WAS NOT FOND OF THE OLD MAN
HE WOULD
NOT GO IF HE COULD HELP IT
WELL WE CAN SOON DETERMINE THAT
IF YOUR FRIEND WAS GOING TO HIS
RELATIVE LORD MOUNT JAMES YOU HAVE THEN TO EXPLAIN THE VISIT OF THIS
ROUGH LOOKING FELLOW AT SO LATE AN HOUR AND THE AGITATION THAT WAS
CAUSED BY HIS COMING
CYRIL OVERTON PRESSED HIS HANDS TO HIS HEAD
I CAN MAKE NOTHING OF IT
SAID HE
WELL WELL I HAVE A CLEAR DAY AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THE
MATTER SAID HOLMES
I SHOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE YOUR
PREPARATIONS FOR YOUR MATCH WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN
IT MUST AS YOU SAY HAVE BEEN AN OVERPOWERING NECESSITY WHICH TORE HIM
AWAY IN SUCH A FASHION AND THE SAME NECESSITY IS LIKELY TO HOLD HIM
AWAY
LET US STEP ROUND TOGETHER TO THE HOTEL AND SEE IF THE PORTER CAN
THROW ANY FRESH LIGHT UPON THE MATTER
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A PAST MASTER IN THE ART OF PUTTING A HUMBLE
WITNESS AT HIS EASE AND VERY SOON IN THE PRIVACY OF GODFREY STAUNTON'S
ABANDONED ROOM HE HAD EXTRACTED ALL THAT THE PORTER HAD TO TELL
THE VISITOR OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WAS NOT A GENTLEMAN NEITHER WAS HE A
WORKINGMAN
HE WAS SIMPLY WHAT THE PORTER DESCRIBED AS A MEDIUM LOOKING
CHAP A MAN OF FIFTY BEARD GRIZZLED PALE FACE QUIETLY DRESSED
HE SEEMED HIMSELF TO BE AGITATED
THE PORTER HAD OBSERVED HIS HAND
TREMBLING WHEN HE HAD HELD OUT THE NOTE
GODFREY STAUNTON HAD CRAMMED
THE NOTE INTO HIS POCKET
STAUNTON HAD NOT SHAKEN HANDS WITH THE MAN IN
THE HALL
THEY HAD EXCHANGED A FEW SENTENCES OF WHICH THE PORTER HAD
ONLY DISTINGUISHED THE ONE WORD TIME THEN THEY HAD HURRIED OFF IN THE
MANNER DESCRIBED
IT WAS JUST HALF PAST TEN BY THE HALL CLOCK
LET ME SEE SAID HOLMES SEATING HIMSELF ON STAUNTON'S BED
YOU ARE
THE DAY PORTER ARE YOU NOT
YES SIR I GO OFF DUTY AT ELEVEN
THE NIGHT PORTER SAW NOTHING I SUPPOSE
NO SIR ONE THEATRE PARTY CAME IN LATE
NO ONE ELSE
WERE YOU ON DUTY ALL DAY YESTERDAY
YES SIR
DID YOU TAKE ANY MESSAGES TO MR
STAUNTON
YES SIR ONE TELEGRAM
AH THAT'S INTERESTING
WHAT O'CLOCK WAS THIS
ABOUT SIX
WHERE WAS MR
STAUNTON WHEN HE RECEIVED IT
HERE IN HIS ROOM
WERE YOU PRESENT WHEN HE OPENED IT
YES SIR I WAITED TO SEE IF THERE WAS AN ANSWER
WELL WAS THERE
YES SIR HE WROTE AN ANSWER
DID YOU TAKE IT
NO HE TOOK IT HIMSELF
BUT HE WROTE IT IN YOUR PRESENCE
YES SIR
I WAS STANDING BY THE DOOR AND HE WITH HIS BACK TURNED AT
THAT TABLE
WHEN HE HAD WRITTEN IT HE SAID 'ALL RIGHT PORTER I WILL
TAKE THIS MYSELF
WHAT DID HE WRITE IT WITH
A PEN SIR
WAS THE TELEGRAPHIC FORM ONE OF THESE ON THE TABLE
YES SIR IT WAS THE TOP ONE
HOLMES ROSE
TAKING THE FORMS HE CARRIED THEM OVER TO THE WINDOW AND
CAREFULLY EXAMINED THAT WHICH WAS UPPERMOST
IT IS A PITY HE DID NOT WRITE IN PENCIL SAID HE THROWING THEM DOWN
AGAIN WITH A SHRUG OF DISAPPOINTMENT
AS YOU HAVE NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY
OBSERVED WATSON THE IMPRESSION USUALLY GOES THROUGH A FACT WHICH HAS
DISSOLVED MANY A HAPPY MARRIAGE
HOWEVER I CAN FIND NO TRACE HERE
I
REJOICE HOWEVER TO PERCEIVE THAT HE WROTE WITH A BROAD POINTED QUILL
PEN AND I CAN HARDLY DOUBT THAT WE WILL FIND SOME IMPRESSION UPON THIS
BLOTTING PAD
AH YES SURELY THIS IS THE VERY THING
HE TORE OFF A STRIP OF THE BLOTTING PAPER AND TURNED TOWARDS US THE
FOLLOWING HIEROGLYPHIC
GRAPHIC
CYRIL OVERTON WAS MUCH EXCITED
HOLD IT TO THE GLASS HE CRIED
THAT IS UNNECESSARY SAID HOLMES
THE PAPER IS THIN AND THE REVERSE
WILL GIVE THE MESSAGE
HERE IT IS HE TURNED IT OVER AND WE READ
GRAPHIC STAND BY US FOR GODS SAKE
SO THAT IS THE TAIL END OF THE TELEGRAM WHICH GODFREY STAUNTON
DISPATCHED WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE
THERE ARE AT LEAST
SIX WORDS OF THE MESSAGE WHICH HAVE ESCAPED US BUT WHAT REMAINS 'STAND
BY US FOR GOD'S SAKE PROVES THAT THIS YOUNG MAN SAW A FORMIDABLE
DANGER WHICH APPROACHED HIM AND FROM WHICH SOMEONE ELSE COULD PROTECT
HIM
'US MARK YOU ANOTHER PERSON WAS INVOLVED
WHO SHOULD IT BE BUT
THE PALE FACED BEARDED MAN WHO SEEMED HIMSELF IN SO NERVOUS A STATE
WHAT THEN IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN GODFREY STAUNTON AND THE BEARDED
MAN AND WHAT IS THE THIRD SOURCE FROM WHICH EACH OF THEM SOUGHT FOR
HELP AGAINST PRESSING DANGER OUR INQUIRY HAS ALREADY NARROWED DOWN TO
THAT
WE HAVE ONLY TO FIND TO WHOM THAT TELEGRAM IS ADDRESSED I SUGGESTED
EXACTLY MY DEAR WATSON
YOUR REFLECTION THOUGH PROFOUND HAD ALREADY
CROSSED MY MIND
BUT I DARESAY IT MAY HAVE COME TO YOUR NOTICE THAT
COUNTERFOIL OF ANOTHER MAN'S MESSAGE THERE MAY BE SOME DISINCLINATION
ON THE PART OF THE OFFICIALS TO OBLIGE YOU
THERE IS SO MUCH RED TAPE IN
THESE MATTERS
HOWEVER I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH A LITTLE DELICACY
AND FINESSE THE END MAY BE ATTAINED
MEANWHILE I SHOULD LIKE IN YOUR
PRESENCE MR
OVERTON TO GO THROUGH THESE PAPERS WHICH HAVE BEEN LEFT
UPON THE TABLE
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LETTERS BILLS AND NOTEBOOKS WHICH HOLMES
TURNED OVER AND EXAMINED WITH QUICK NERVOUS FINGERS AND DARTING
PENETRATING EYES
NOTHING HERE HE SAID AT LAST
BY THE WAY I
SUPPOSE YOUR FRIEND WAS A HEALTHY YOUNG FELLOW NOTHING AMISS WITH HIM
SOUND AS A BELL
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN HIM ILL
NOT A DAY
HE HAS BEEN LAID UP WITH A HACK AND ONCE HE SLIPPED HIS
KNEE CAP BUT THAT WAS NOTHING
PERHAPS HE WAS NOT SO STRONG AS YOU SUPPOSE
I SHOULD THINK HE MAY
HAVE HAD SOME SECRET TROUBLE
WITH YOUR ASSENT I WILL PUT ONE OR TWO
OF THESE PAPERS IN MY POCKET IN CASE THEY SHOULD BEAR UPON OUR FUTURE
INQUIRY
ONE MOMENT ONE MOMENT CRIED A QUERULOUS VOICE AND WE LOOKED UP TO
FIND A QUEER LITTLE OLD MAN JERKING AND TWITCHING IN THE DOORWAY
HE
WAS DRESSED IN RUSTY BLACK WITH A VERY BROAD BRIMMED TOP HAT AND A
LOOSE WHITE NECKTIE THE WHOLE EFFECT BEING THAT OF A VERY RUSTIC PARSON
OR OF AN UNDERTAKER'S MUTE
YET IN SPITE OF HIS SHABBY AND EVEN ABSURD
APPEARANCE HIS VOICE HAD A SHARP CRACKLE AND HIS MANNER A QUICK
INTENSITY WHICH COMMANDED ATTENTION
WHO ARE YOU SIR AND BY WHAT RIGHT DO YOU TOUCH THIS GENTLEMAN'S
PAPERS HE ASKED
I AM A PRIVATE DETECTIVE AND I AM ENDEAVOURING TO EXPLAIN HIS
DISAPPEARANCE
OH YOU ARE ARE YOU AND WHO INSTRUCTED YOU EH
THIS GENTLEMAN MR
STAUNTON'S FRIEND WAS REFERRED TO ME BY SCOTLAND
YARD
WHO ARE YOU SIR
I AM CYRIL OVERTON
THEN IT IS YOU WHO SENT ME A TELEGRAM
MY NAME IS LORD MOUNT JAMES
I
CAME ROUND AS QUICKLY AS THE BAYSWATER BUS WOULD BRING ME
SO YOU HAVE
INSTRUCTED A DETECTIVE
YES SIR
AND ARE YOU PREPARED TO MEET THE COST
I HAVE NO DOUBT SIR THAT MY FRIEND GODFREY WHEN WE FIND HIM WILL BE
PREPARED TO DO THAT
BUT IF HE IS NEVER FOUND EH ANSWER ME THAT
IN THAT CASE NO DOUBT HIS FAMILY
NOTHING OF THE SORT SIR SCREAMED THE LITTLE MAN
DON'T LOOK TO ME
FOR A PENNY NOT A PENNY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT MR
DETECTIVE I AM ALL
THE FAMILY THAT THIS YOUNG MAN HAS GOT AND I TELL YOU THAT I AM NOT
RESPONSIBLE
IF HE HAS ANY EXPECTATIONS IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I
HAVE NEVER WASTED MONEY AND I DO NOT PROPOSE TO BEGIN TO DO SO NOW
AS
TO THOSE PAPERS WITH WHICH YOU ARE MAKING SO FREE I MAY TELL YOU THAT
IN CASE THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING OF ANY VALUE AMONG THEM YOU WILL BE
HELD STRICTLY TO ACCOUNT FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THEM
VERY GOOD SIR SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
MAY I ASK IN THE MEANWHILE
WHETHER YOU HAVE YOURSELF ANY THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS YOUNG MAN'S
DISAPPEARANCE
NO SIR I HAVE NOT
HE IS BIG ENOUGH AND OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK AFTER
HIMSELF AND IF HE IS SO FOOLISH AS TO LOSE HIMSELF I ENTIRELY REFUSE
TO ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HUNTING FOR HIM
I QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION SAID HOLMES WITH A MISCHIEVOUS
TWINKLE IN HIS EYES
PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND MINE
GODFREY
STAUNTON APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A POOR MAN
IF HE HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED IT
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR ANYTHING WHICH HE HIMSELF POSSESSES
THE FAME
OF YOUR WEALTH HAS GONE ABROAD LORD MOUNT JAMES AND IT IS ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE THAT A GANG OF THIEVES HAVE SECURED YOUR NEPHEW IN ORDER TO
GAIN FROM HIM SOME INFORMATION AS TO YOUR HOUSE YOUR HABITS AND YOUR
TREASURE
THE FACE OF OUR UNPLEASANT LITTLE VISITOR TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS
NECKCLOTH
HEAVENS SIR WHAT AN IDEA I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH VILLAINY WHAT
INHUMAN ROGUES THERE ARE IN THE WORLD BUT GODFREY IS A FINE LAD A
STAUNCH LAD
NOTHING WOULD INDUCE HIM TO GIVE HIS OLD UNCLE AWAY
I'LL
HAVE THE PLATE MOVED OVER TO THE BANK THIS EVENING
IN THE MEANTIME
SPARE NO PAINS MR
DETECTIVE I BEG YOU TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED TO
BRING HIM SAFELY BACK
AS TO MONEY WELL SO FAR AS A FIVER OR EVEN A
TENNER GOES YOU CAN ALWAYS LOOK TO ME
EVEN IN HIS CHASTENED FRAME OF MIND THE NOBLE MISER COULD GIVE US NO
INFORMATION WHICH COULD HELP US FOR HE KNEW LITTLE OF THE PRIVATE LIFE
OF HIS NEPHEW
OUR ONLY CLUE LAY IN THE TRUNCATED TELEGRAM AND WITH A
COPY OF THIS IN HIS HAND HOLMES SET FORTH TO FIND A SECOND LINK FOR
HIS CHAIN
WE HAD SHAKEN OFF LORD MOUNT JAMES AND OVERTON HAD GONE TO
CONSULT WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM OVER THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD
BEFALLEN THEM
THERE WAS A TELEGRAPH OFFICE AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOTEL
WE
HALTED OUTSIDE IT
IT'S WORTH TRYING WATSON SAID HOLMES
OF COURSE WITH A WARRANT WE
COULD DEMAND TO SEE THE COUNTERFOILS BUT WE HAVE NOT REACHED THAT STAGE
YET
I DON'T SUPPOSE THEY REMEMBER FACES IN SO BUSY A PLACE
LET US
VENTURE IT
I AM SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU SAID HE IN HIS BLANDEST MANNER TO THE
YOUNG WOMAN BEHIND THE GRATING THERE IS SOME SMALL MISTAKE ABOUT A
TELEGRAM I SENT YESTERDAY
I HAVE HAD NO ANSWER AND I VERY MUCH FEAR
THAT I MUST HAVE OMITTED TO PUT MY NAME AT THE END
COULD YOU TELL ME IF
THIS WAS SO
THE YOUNG WOMAN TURNED OVER A SHEAF OF COUNTERFOILS
WHAT O'CLOCK WAS IT SHE ASKED
A LITTLE AFTER SIX
WHOM WAS IT TO
HOLMES PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS AND GLANCED AT ME
THE LAST WORDS
IN IT WERE 'FOR GOD'S SAKE HE WHISPERED CONFIDENTIALLY I AM VERY
ANXIOUS AT GETTING NO ANSWER
THE YOUNG WOMAN SEPARATED ONE OF THE FORMS
THIS IS IT
THERE IS NO NAME SAID SHE SMOOTHING IT OUT UPON THE
COUNTER
THEN THAT OF COURSE ACCOUNTS FOR MY GETTING NO ANSWER SAID HOLMES
DEAR ME HOW VERY STUPID OF ME TO BE SURE GOOD MORNING MISS AND
MANY THANKS FOR HAVING RELIEVED MY MIND HE CHUCKLED AND RUBBED HIS
HANDS WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE STREET ONCE MORE
WELL I ASKED
WE PROGRESS MY DEAR WATSON WE PROGRESS
I HAD SEVEN DIFFERENT SCHEMES
FOR GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THAT TELEGRAM BUT I COULD HARDLY HOPE TO
SUCCEED THE VERY FIRST TIME
AND WHAT HAVE YOU GAINED
A STARTING POINT FOR OUR INVESTIGATION HE HAILED A CAB
KING'S CROSS
STATION SAID HE
WE HAVE A JOURNEY THEN
YES I THINK WE MUST RUN DOWN TO CAMBRIDGE TOGETHER
ALL THE
INDICATIONS SEEM TO ME TO POINT IN THAT DIRECTION
TELL ME I ASKED AS WE RATTLED UP GRAY'S INN ROAD HAVE YOU ANY
SUSPICION YET AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISAPPEARANCE I DON'T THINK THAT
AMONG ALL OUR CASES I HAVE KNOWN ONE WHERE THE MOTIVES ARE MORE OBSCURE
SURELY YOU DON'T REALLY IMAGINE THAT HE MAY BE KIDNAPPED IN ORDER TO
GIVE INFORMATION AGAINST HIS WEALTHY UNCLE
I CONFESS MY DEAR WATSON THAT THAT DOES NOT APPEAL TO ME AS A VERY
PROBABLE EXPLANATION
IT STRUCK ME HOWEVER AS BEING THE ONE WHICH WAS
MOST LIKELY TO INTEREST THAT EXCEEDINGLY UNPLEASANT OLD PERSON
IT CERTAINLY DID THAT BUT WHAT ARE YOUR ALTERNATIVES
I COULD MENTION SEVERAL
YOU MUST ADMIT THAT IT IS CURIOUS AND
SUGGESTIVE THAT THIS INCIDENT SHOULD OCCUR ON THE EVE OF THIS IMPORTANT
MATCH AND SHOULD INVOLVE THE ONLY MAN WHOSE PRESENCE SEEMS ESSENTIAL TO
THE SUCCESS OF THE SIDE
IT MAY OF COURSE BE A COINCIDENCE BUT IT
IS INTERESTING
AMATEUR SPORT IS FREE FROM BETTING BUT A GOOD DEAL OF
OUTSIDE BETTING GOES ON AMONG THE PUBLIC AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT
MIGHT BE WORTH SOMEONE'S WHILE TO GET AT A PLAYER AS THE RUFFIANS OF
THE TURF GET AT A RACE HORSE
THERE IS ONE EXPLANATION
A SECOND
VERY OBVIOUS ONE IS THAT THIS YOUNG MAN REALLY IS THE HEIR OF A GREAT
PROPERTY HOWEVER MODEST HIS MEANS MAY AT PRESENT BE AND IT IS NOT
IMPOSSIBLE THAT A PLOT TO HOLD HIM FOR RANSOM MIGHT BE CONCOCTED
THESE THEORIES TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF THE TELEGRAM
QUITE TRUE WATSON
THE TELEGRAM STILL REMAINS THE ONLY SOLID THING
WITH WHICH WE HAVE TO DEAL AND WE MUST NOT PERMIT OUR ATTENTION TO
WANDER AWAY FROM IT
IT IS TO GAIN LIGHT UPON THE PURPOSE OF THIS
TELEGRAM THAT WE ARE NOW UPON OUR WAY TO CAMBRIDGE
THE PATH OF OUR
INVESTIGATION IS AT PRESENT OBSCURE BUT I SHALL BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED
IF BEFORE EVENING WE HAVE NOT CLEARED IT UP OR MADE A CONSIDERABLE
ADVANCE ALONG IT
IT WAS ALREADY DARK WHEN WE REACHED THE OLD UNIVERSITY CITY
HOLMES TOOK
A CAB AT THE STATION AND ORDERED THE MAN TO DRIVE TO THE HOUSE OF DR
LESLIE ARMSTRONG
A FEW MINUTES LATER WE HAD STOPPED AT A LARGE MANSION
IN THE BUSIEST THOROUGHFARE
WE WERE SHOWN IN AND AFTER A LONG WAIT
WERE AT LAST ADMITTED INTO THE CONSULTING ROOM WHERE WE FOUND THE
DOCTOR SEATED BEHIND HIS TABLE
IT ARGUES THE DEGREE IN WHICH I HAD LOST TOUCH WITH MY PROFESSION THAT
THE NAME OF LESLIE ARMSTRONG WAS UNKNOWN TO ME
NOW I AM AWARE THAT HE
IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY
BUT A THINKER OF EUROPEAN REPUTATION IN MORE THAN ONE BRANCH OF SCIENCE
YET EVEN WITHOUT KNOWING HIS BRILLIANT RECORD ONE COULD NOT FAIL TO BE
IMPRESSED BY A MERE GLANCE AT THE MAN THE SQUARE MASSIVE FACE THE
BROODING EYES UNDER THE THATCHED BROWS AND THE GRANITE MOULDING OF THE
INFLEXIBLE JAW
A MAN OF DEEP CHARACTER A MAN WITH AN ALERT MIND GRIM
ASCETIC SELF CONTAINED FORMIDABLE SO I READ DR
LESLIE ARMSTRONG
HE
HELD MY FRIEND'S CARD IN HIS HAND AND HE LOOKED UP WITH NO VERY PLEASED
EXPRESSION UPON HIS DOUR FEATURES
I HAVE HEARD YOUR NAME MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I AM AWARE OF YOUR
PROFESSION ONE OF WHICH I BY NO MEANS APPROVE
IN THAT DOCTOR YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH EVERY
CRIMINAL IN THE COUNTRY SAID MY FRIEND QUIETLY
SO FAR AS YOUR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE SUPPRESSION OF CRIME
SIR THEY MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF EVERY REASONABLE MEMBER OF THE
COMMUNITY THOUGH I CANNOT DOUBT THAT THE OFFICIAL MACHINERY IS AMPLY
SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE
WHERE YOUR CALLING IS MORE OPEN TO CRITICISM
IS WHEN YOU PRY INTO THE SECRETS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHEN YOU RAKE
UP FAMILY MATTERS WHICH ARE BETTER HIDDEN AND WHEN YOU INCIDENTALLY
WASTE THE TIME OF MEN WHO ARE MORE BUSY THAN YOURSELF
AT THE PRESENT
MOMENT FOR EXAMPLE I SHOULD BE WRITING A TREATISE INSTEAD OF
CONVERSING WITH YOU
NO DOUBT DOCTOR AND YET THE CONVERSATION MAY PROVE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE TREATISE
INCIDENTALLY I MAY TELL YOU THAT WE ARE DOING THE
REVERSE OF WHAT YOU VERY JUSTLY BLAME AND THAT WE ARE ENDEAVOURING
TO PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF PRIVATE MATTERS WHICH MUST
NECESSARILY FOLLOW WHEN ONCE THE CASE IS FAIRLY IN THE HANDS OF THE
OFFICIAL POLICE
YOU MAY LOOK UPON ME SIMPLY AS AN IRREGULAR PIONEER
WHO GOES IN FRONT OF THE REGULAR FORCES OF THE COUNTRY
I HAVE COME TO
ASK YOU ABOUT MR
GODFREY STAUNTON
WHAT ABOUT HIM
YOU KNOW HIM DO YOU NOT
HE IS AN INTIMATE FRIEND OF MINE
YOU ARE AWARE THAT HE HAS DISAPPEARED
AH INDEED THERE WAS NO CHANGE OF EXPRESSION IN THE RUGGED FEATURES
OF THE DOCTOR
HE LEFT HIS HOTEL LAST NIGHT HE HAS NOT BEEN HEARD OF
NO DOUBT HE WILL RETURN
TO MORROW IS THE 'VARSITY FOOTBALL MATCH
I HAVE NO SYMPATHY WITH THESE CHILDISH GAMES
THE YOUNG MAN'S FATE
INTERESTS ME DEEPLY SINCE I KNOW HIM AND LIKE HIM
THE FOOTBALL MATCH
DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY HORIZON AT ALL
I CLAIM YOUR SYMPATHY THEN IN MY INVESTIGATION OF MR
STAUNTON'S
FATE
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS
CERTAINLY NOT
YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE YESTERDAY
NO I HAVE NOT
WAS MR
STAUNTON A HEALTHY MAN
ABSOLUTELY
DID YOU EVER KNOW HIM ILL
NEVER
HOLMES POPPED A SHEET OF PAPER BEFORE THE DOCTOR'S EYES
THEN PERHAPS
YOU WILL EXPLAIN THIS RECEIPTED BILL FOR THIRTEEN GUINEAS PAID BY MR
GODFREY STAUNTON LAST MONTH TO DR
LESLIE ARMSTRONG OF CAMBRIDGE
I
PICKED IT OUT FROM AMONG THE PAPERS UPON HIS DESK
THE DOCTOR FLUSHED WITH ANGER
I DO NOT FEEL THAT THERE IS ANY REASON WHY I SHOULD RENDER AN
EXPLANATION TO YOU MR
HOLMES
HOLMES REPLACED THE BILL IN HIS NOTEBOOK
IF YOU PREFER A PUBLIC
EXPLANATION IT MUST COME SOONER OR LATER SAID HE
I HAVE ALREADY
TOLD YOU THAT I CAN HUSH UP THAT WHICH OTHERS WILL BE BOUND TO PUBLISH
AND YOU WOULD REALLY BE WISER TO TAKE ME INTO YOUR COMPLETE CONFIDENCE
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
DID YOU HEAR FROM MR
STAUNTON IN LONDON
CERTAINLY NOT
DEAR ME DEAR ME THE POSTOFFICE AGAIN HOLMES SIGHED WEARILY
A MOST URGENT TELEGRAM WAS DISPATCHED TO YOU FROM LONDON BY GODFREY
STAUNTON AT SIX FIFTEEN YESTERDAY EVENING A TELEGRAM WHICH IS
UNDOUBTEDLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIS DISAPPEARANCE AND YET YOU HAVE NOT HAD
IT
IT IS MOST CULPABLE
I SHALL CERTAINLY GO DOWN TO THE OFFICE HERE
AND REGISTER A COMPLAINT
DR
LESLIE ARMSTRONG SPRANG UP FROM BEHIND HIS DESK AND HIS DARK FACE
WAS CRIMSON WITH FURY
I'LL TROUBLE YOU TO WALK OUT OF MY HOUSE SIR SAID HE
YOU CAN TELL
YOUR EMPLOYER LORD MOUNT JAMES THAT I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE ANYTHING TO
DO EITHER WITH HIM OR WITH HIS AGENTS
NO SIR NOT ANOTHER WORD HE
RANG THE BELL FURIOUSLY
JOHN SHOW THESE GENTLEMEN OUT A POMPOUS
BUTLER USHERED US SEVERELY TO THE DOOR AND WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE
STREET
HOLMES BURST OUT LAUGHING
DR
LESLIE ARMSTRONG IS CERTAINLY A MAN OF ENERGY AND CHARACTER SAID
HE
I HAVE NOT SEEN A MAN WHO IF HE TURNS HIS TALENTS THAT WAY WAS
MORE CALCULATED TO FILL THE GAP LEFT BY THE ILLUSTRIOUS MORIARTY
AND NOW MY POOR WATSON HERE WE ARE STRANDED AND FRIENDLESS IN THIS
INHOSPITABLE TOWN WHICH WE CANNOT LEAVE WITHOUT ABANDONING OUR CASE
THIS LITTLE INN JUST OPPOSITE ARMSTRONG'S HOUSE IS SINGULARLY ADAPTED TO
OUR NEEDS
IF YOU WOULD ENGAGE A FRONT ROOM AND PURCHASE THE NECESSARIES
FOR THE NIGHT I MAY HAVE TIME TO MAKE A FEW INQUIRIES
THESE FEW INQUIRIES PROVED HOWEVER TO BE A MORE LENGTHY PROCEEDING
THAN HOLMES HAD IMAGINED FOR HE DID NOT RETURN TO THE INN UNTIL NEARLY
NINE O'CLOCK
HE WAS PALE AND DEJECTED STAINED WITH DUST AND EXHAUSTED
WITH HUNGER AND FATIGUE
A COLD SUPPER WAS READY UPON THE TABLE AND
WHEN HIS NEEDS WERE SATISFIED AND HIS PIPE ALIGHT HE WAS READY TO TAKE
THAT HALF COMIC AND WHOLLY PHILOSOPHIC VIEW WHICH WAS NATURAL TO HIM
WHEN HIS AFFAIRS WERE GOING AWRY
THE SOUND OF CARRIAGE WHEELS CAUSED
HIM TO RISE AND GLANCE OUT OF THE WINDOW
A BROUGHAM AND PAIR OF GRAYS
UNDER THE GLARE OF A GAS LAMP STOOD BEFORE THE DOCTOR'S DOOR
IT'S BEEN OUT THREE HOURS SAID HOLMES STARTED AT HALF PAST SIX AND
HERE IT IS BACK AGAIN
THAT GIVES A RADIUS OF TEN OR TWELVE MILES AND
HE DOES IT ONCE OR SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY
NO UNUSUAL THING FOR A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE
BUT ARMSTRONG IS NOT REALLY A DOCTOR IN PRACTICE
HE IS A LECTURER AND
A CONSULTANT BUT HE DOES NOT CARE FOR GENERAL PRACTICE WHICH DISTRACTS
HIM FROM HIS LITERARY WORK
WHY THEN DOES HE MAKE THESE LONG JOURNEYS
WHICH MUST BE EXCEEDINGLY IRKSOME TO HIM AND WHO IS IT THAT HE VISITS
HIS COACHMAN
MY DEAR WATSON CAN YOU DOUBT THAT IT WAS TO HIM THAT I FIRST APPLIED
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT CAME FROM HIS OWN INNATE DEPRAVITY OR FROM THE
PROMPTINGS OF HIS MASTER BUT HE WAS RUDE ENOUGH TO SET A DOG AT ME
NEITHER DOG NOR MAN LIKED THE LOOK OF MY STICK HOWEVER AND THE MATTER
FELL THROUGH
RELATIONS WERE STRAINED AFTER THAT AND FURTHER INQUIRIES
OUT OF THE QUESTION
ALL THAT I HAVE LEARNED I GOT FROM A FRIENDLY
NATIVE IN THE YARD OF OUR OWN INN
IT WAS HE WHO TOLD ME OF THE DOCTOR'S
HABITS AND OF HIS DAILY JOURNEY
AT THAT INSTANT TO GIVE POINT TO HIS
WORDS THE CARRIAGE CAME ROUND TO THE DOOR
COULD YOU NOT FOLLOW IT
EXCELLENT WATSON YOU ARE SCINTILLATING THIS EVENING
THE IDEA DID
CROSS MY MIND
THERE IS AS YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED A BICYCLE SHOP NEXT
TO OUR INN
INTO THIS I RUSHED ENGAGED A BICYCLE AND WAS ABLE TO GET
STARTED BEFORE THE CARRIAGE WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT
I RAPIDLY OVERTOOK
IT AND THEN KEEPING AT A DISCREET DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO I
FOLLOWED ITS LIGHTS UNTIL WE WERE CLEAR OF THE TOWN
WE HAD GOT WELL OUT
ON THE COUNTRY ROAD WHEN A SOMEWHAT MORTIFYING INCIDENT OCCURRED
THE
CARRIAGE STOPPED THE DOCTOR ALIGHTED WALKED SWIFTLY BACK TO WHERE I
HAD ALSO HALTED AND TOLD ME IN AN EXCELLENT SARDONIC FASHION THAT
HE FEARED THE ROAD WAS NARROW AND THAT HE HOPED HIS CARRIAGE DID NOT
IMPEDE THE PASSAGE OF MY BICYCLE
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ADMIRABLE
THAN HIS WAY OF PUTTING IT
I AT ONCE RODE PAST THE CARRIAGE AND
KEEPING TO THE MAIN ROAD I WENT ON FOR A FEW MILES AND THEN HALTED IN
A CONVENIENT PLACE TO SEE IF THE CARRIAGE PASSED
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF
IT HOWEVER AND SO IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT IT HAD TURNED DOWN ONE OF
SEVERAL SIDE ROADS WHICH I HAD OBSERVED
I RODE BACK BUT AGAIN SAW
NOTHING OF THE CARRIAGE AND NOW AS YOU PERCEIVE IT HAS RETURNED AFTER
ME
OF COURSE I HAD AT THE OUTSET NO PARTICULAR REASON TO CONNECT
THESE JOURNEYS WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF GODFREY STAUNTON AND WAS ONLY
INCLINED TO INVESTIGATE THEM ON THE GENERAL GROUNDS THAT EVERYTHING
WHICH CONCERNS DR
ARMSTRONG IS AT PRESENT OF INTEREST TO US BUT NOW
THAT I FIND HE KEEPS SO KEEN A LOOK OUT UPON ANYONE WHO MAY FOLLOW HIM
ON THESE EXCURSIONS THE AFFAIR APPEARS MORE IMPORTANT AND I SHALL NOT
BE SATISFIED UNTIL I HAVE MADE THE MATTER CLEAR
WE CAN FOLLOW HIM TO MORROW
CAN WE IT IS NOT SO EASY AS YOU SEEM TO THINK
YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR
WITH CAMBRIDGESHIRE SCENERY ARE YOU IT DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO
CONCEALMENT
ALL THIS COUNTRY THAT I PASSED OVER TO NIGHT IS AS FLAT AND
CLEAN AS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND AND THE MAN WE ARE FOLLOWING IS NO FOOL
AS HE VERY CLEARLY SHOWED TO NIGHT
I HAVE WIRED TO OVERTON TO LET US
KNOW ANY FRESH LONDON DEVELOPMENTS AT THIS ADDRESS AND IN THE MEANTIME
WE CAN ONLY CONCENTRATE OUR ATTENTION UPON DR
ARMSTRONG WHOSE NAME
THE OBLIGING YOUNG LADY AT THE OFFICE ALLOWED ME TO READ UPON THE
COUNTERFOIL OF STAUNTON'S URGENT MESSAGE
HE KNOWS WHERE THE YOUNG MAN
IS TO THAT I'LL SWEAR AND IF HE KNOWS THEN IT MUST BE OUR OWN FAULT
IF WE CANNOT MANAGE TO KNOW ALSO
AT PRESENT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT
THE ODD TRICK IS IN HIS POSSESSION AND AS YOU ARE AWARE WATSON IT IS
NOT MY HABIT TO LEAVE THE GAME IN THAT CONDITION
AND YET THE NEXT DAY BROUGHT US NO NEARER TO THE SOLUTION OF THE
MYSTERY
A NOTE WAS HANDED IN AFTER BREAKFAST WHICH HOLMES PASSED
ACROSS TO ME WITH A SMILE
SIR IT RAN
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME IN DOGGING MY MOVEMENTS
I HAVE AS YOU DISCOVERED LAST NIGHT A WINDOW AT THE BACK OF MY
BROUGHAM AND IF YOU DESIRE A TWENTY MILE RIDE WHICH WILL LEAD YOU TO
THE SPOT FROM WHICH YOU STARTED YOU HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW ME
MEANWHILE
I CAN INFORM YOU THAT NO SPYING UPON ME CAN IN ANY WAY HELP MR
GODFREY
STAUNTON AND I AM CONVINCED THAT THE BEST SERVICE YOU CAN DO TO THAT
GENTLEMAN IS TO RETURN AT ONCE TO LONDON AND TO REPORT TO YOUR EMPLOYER
THAT YOU ARE UNABLE TO TRACE HIM
YOUR TIME IN CAMBRIDGE WILL CERTAINLY
BE WASTED
YOURS FAITHFULLY LESLIE ARMSTRONG
AN OUTSPOKEN HONEST ANTAGONIST IS THE DOCTOR SAID HOLMES
WELL
WELL HE EXCITES MY CURIOSITY AND I MUST REALLY KNOW BEFORE I LEAVE
HIM
HIS CARRIAGE IS AT HIS DOOR NOW SAID I
THERE HE IS STEPPING INTO
IT
I SAW HIM GLANCE UP AT OUR WINDOW AS HE DID SO
SUPPOSE I TRY MY
LUCK UPON THE BICYCLE
NO NO MY DEAR WATSON WITH ALL RESPECT FOR YOUR NATURAL ACUMEN I DO
NOT THINK THAT YOU ARE QUITE A MATCH FOR THE WORTHY DOCTOR
I THINK THAT
POSSIBLY I CAN ATTAIN OUR END BY SOME INDEPENDENT EXPLORATIONS OF MY
OWN
I AM AFRAID THAT I MUST LEAVE YOU TO YOUR OWN DEVICES AS THE
APPEARANCE OF TWO INQUIRING STRANGERS UPON A SLEEPY COUNTRYSIDE MIGHT
EXCITE MORE GOSSIP THAN I CARE FOR
NO DOUBT YOU WILL FIND SOME SIGHTS
TO AMUSE YOU IN THIS VENERABLE CITY AND I HOPE TO BRING BACK A MORE
FAVOURABLE REPORT TO YOU BEFORE EVENING
ONCE MORE HOWEVER MY FRIEND WAS DESTINED TO BE DISAPPOINTED
HE CAME
BACK AT NIGHT WEARY AND UNSUCCESSFUL
I HAVE HAD A BLANK DAY WATSON
HAVING GOT THE DOCTOR'S GENERAL
DIRECTION I SPENT THE DAY IN VISITING ALL THE VILLAGES UPON THAT SIDE
OF CAMBRIDGE AND COMPARING NOTES WITH PUBLICANS AND OTHER LOCAL NEWS
AGENCIES
I HAVE COVERED SOME GROUND
CHESTERTON HISTON WATERBEACH
AND OAKINGTON HAVE EACH BEEN EXPLORED AND HAVE EACH PROVED
DISAPPOINTING
THE DAILY APPEARANCE OF A BROUGHAM AND PAIR COULD HARDLY
HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED IN SUCH SLEEPY HOLLOWS
THE DOCTOR HAS SCORED ONCE
MORE
IS THERE A TELEGRAM FOR ME
YES I OPENED IT
HERE IT IS
ASK FOR POMPEY FROM JEREMY DIXON TRINITY COLLEGE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
OH IT IS CLEAR ENOUGH
IT IS FROM OUR FRIEND OVERTON AND IS IN ANSWER
TO A QUESTION FROM ME
I'LL JUST SEND ROUND A NOTE TO MR
JEREMY DIXON
AND THEN I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT OUR LUCK WILL TURN
BY THE WAY IS THERE
ANY NEWS OF THE MATCH
YES THE LOCAL EVENING PAPER HAS AN EXCELLENT ACCOUNT IN ITS LAST
EDITION
OXFORD WON BY A GOAL AND TWO TRIES
THE LAST SENTENCES OF THE
DESCRIPTION SAY
'THE DEFEAT OF THE LIGHT BLUES MAY BE ENTIRELY ATTRIBUTED TO THE
UNFORTUNATE ABSENCE OF THE CRACK INTERNATIONAL GODFREY STAUNTON WHOSE
WANT WAS FELT AT EVERY INSTANT OF THE GAME
THE LACK OF COMBINATION IN
THE THREE QUARTER LINE AND THEIR WEAKNESS BOTH IN ATTACK AND DEFENCE
MORE THAN NEUTRALIZED THE EFFORTS OF A HEAVY AND HARD WORKING PACK
THEN OUR FRIEND OVERTON'S FOREBODINGS HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED SAID
HOLMES
PERSONALLY I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH DR
ARMSTRONG AND FOOTBALL
DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY HORIZON
EARLY TO BED TO NIGHT WATSON FOR I
FORESEE THAT TO MORROW MAY BE AN EVENTFUL DAY
I WAS HORRIFIED BY MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF HOLMES NEXT MORNING FOR HE
SAT BY THE FIRE HOLDING HIS TINY HYPODERMIC SYRINGE
I ASSOCIATED THAT
INSTRUMENT WITH THE SINGLE WEAKNESS OF HIS NATURE AND I FEARED THE
WORST WHEN I SAW IT GLITTERING IN HIS HAND
HE LAUGHED AT MY EXPRESSION
OF DISMAY AND LAID IT UPON THE TABLE
NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM
IT IS NOT UPON
THIS OCCASION THE INSTRUMENT OF EVIL BUT IT WILL RATHER PROVE TO BE THE
KEY WHICH WILL UNLOCK OUR MYSTERY
ON THIS SYRINGE I BASE ALL MY HOPES
I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM A SMALL SCOUTING EXPEDITION AND EVERYTHING IS
FAVOURABLE
EAT A GOOD BREAKFAST WATSON FOR I PROPOSE TO GET UPON DR
ARMSTRONG'S TRAIL TO DAY AND ONCE ON IT I WILL NOT STOP FOR REST OR
FOOD UNTIL I RUN HIM TO HIS BURROW
IN THAT CASE SAID I WE HAD BEST CARRY OUR BREAKFAST WITH US FOR HE
IS MAKING AN EARLY START
HIS CARRIAGE IS AT THE DOOR
NEVER MIND
LET HIM GO
HE WILL BE CLEVER IF HE CAN DRIVE WHERE I
CANNOT FOLLOW HIM
WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED COME DOWNSTAIRS WITH ME AND
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO A DETECTIVE WHO IS A VERY EMINENT SPECIALIST IN
THE WORK THAT LIES BEFORE US
WHEN WE DESCENDED I FOLLOWED HOLMES INTO THE STABLE YARD WHERE
HE OPENED THE DOOR OF A LOOSE BOX AND LED OUT A SQUAT LOP EARED
WHITE AND TAN DOG SOMETHING BETWEEN A BEAGLE AND A FOXHOUND
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO POMPEY SAID HE
POMPEY IS THE PRIDE OF THE
LOCAL DRAGHOUNDS NO VERY GREAT FLIER AS HIS BUILD WILL SHOW BUT
A STAUNCH HOUND ON A SCENT
WELL POMPEY YOU MAY NOT BE FAST BUT
I EXPECT YOU WILL BE TOO FAST FOR A COUPLE OF MIDDLE AGED LONDON
GENTLEMEN SO I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF FASTENING THIS LEATHER LEASH TO
YOUR COLLAR
NOW BOY COME ALONG AND SHOW WHAT YOU CAN DO HE LED HIM
ACROSS TO THE DOCTOR'S DOOR
THE DOG SNIFFED ROUND FOR AN INSTANT AND
THEN WITH A SHRILL WHINE OF EXCITEMENT STARTED OFF DOWN THE STREET
TUGGING AT HIS LEASH IN HIS EFFORTS TO GO FASTER
IN HALF AN HOUR WE
WERE CLEAR OF THE TOWN AND HASTENING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE HOLMES I ASKED
A THREADBARE AND VENERABLE DEVICE BUT USEFUL UPON OCCASION
I WALKED
INTO THE DOCTOR'S YARD THIS MORNING AND SHOT MY SYRINGE FULL OF ANISEED
OVER THE HIND WHEEL
A DRAGHOUND WILL FOLLOW ANISEED FROM HERE TO JOHN
O'GROAT'S AND OUR FRIEND ARMSTRONG WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE THROUGH THE
CAM BEFORE HE WOULD SHAKE POMPEY OFF HIS TRAIL
OH THE CUNNING RASCAL
THIS IS HOW HE GAVE ME THE SLIP THE OTHER NIGHT
THE DOG HAD SUDDENLY TURNED OUT OF THE MAIN ROAD INTO A GRASS GROWN
LANE
HALF A MILE FARTHER THIS OPENED INTO ANOTHER BROAD ROAD AND THE
TRAIL TURNED HARD TO THE RIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TOWN WHICH WE
HAD JUST QUITTED
THE ROAD TOOK A SWEEP TO THE SOUTH OF THE TOWN AND
CONTINUED IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO THAT IN WHICH WE STARTED
THIS DETOUR HAS BEEN ENTIRELY FOR OUR BENEFIT THEN SAID HOLMES
NO WONDER THAT MY INQUIRIES AMONG THOSE VILLAGERS LED TO NOTHING
THE
DOCTOR HAS CERTAINLY PLAYED THE GAME FOR ALL IT IS WORTH AND ONE WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW THE REASON FOR SUCH ELABORATE DECEPTION
THIS SHOULD BE
THE VILLAGE OF TRUMPINGTON TO THE RIGHT OF US
AND BY JOVE HERE IS THE
BROUGHAM COMING ROUND THE CORNER
QUICK WATSON QUICK OR WE ARE DONE
HE SPRANG THROUGH A GATE INTO A FIELD DRAGGING THE RELUCTANT POMPEY
AFTER HIM
WE HAD HARDLY GOT UNDER THE SHELTER OF THE HEDGE WHEN THE
CARRIAGE RATTLED PAST
I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF DR
ARMSTRONG WITHIN HIS
SHOULDERS BOWED HIS HEAD SUNK ON HIS HANDS THE VERY IMAGE OF DISTRESS
I COULD TELL BY MY COMPANION'S GRAVER FACE THAT HE ALSO HAD SEEN
I FEAR THERE IS SOME DARK ENDING TO OUR QUEST SAID HE
IT CANNOT
BE LONG BEFORE WE KNOW IT
COME POMPEY AH IT IS THE COTTAGE IN THE
FIELD
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT WE HAD REACHED THE END OF OUR JOURNEY
POMPEY RAN ABOUT AND WHINED EAGERLY OUTSIDE THE GATE WHERE THE MARKS
OF THE BROUGHAM'S WHEELS WERE STILL TO BE SEEN
A FOOTPATH LED ACROSS
TO THE LONELY COTTAGE
HOLMES TIED THE DOG TO THE HEDGE AND WE HASTENED
ONWARD
MY FRIEND KNOCKED AT THE LITTLE RUSTIC DOOR AND KNOCKED AGAIN
WITHOUT RESPONSE
AND YET THE COTTAGE WAS NOT DESERTED FOR A LOW
SOUND CAME TO OUR EARS A KIND OF DRONE OF MISERY AND DESPAIR WHICH WAS
INDESCRIBABLY MELANCHOLY
HOLMES PAUSED IRRESOLUTE AND THEN HE GLANCED
BACK AT THE ROAD WHICH HE HAD JUST TRAVERSED
A BROUGHAM WAS COMING DOWN
IT AND THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKING THOSE GRAY HORSES
BY JOVE THE DOCTOR IS COMING BACK CRIED HOLMES
THAT SETTLES IT
WE
ARE BOUND TO SEE WHAT IT MEANS BEFORE HE COMES
HE OPENED THE DOOR AND WE STEPPED INTO THE HALL
THE DRONING SOUND
SWELLED LOUDER UPON OUR EARS UNTIL IT BECAME ONE LONG DEEP WAIL OF
DISTRESS
IT CAME FROM UPSTAIRS
HOLMES DARTED UP AND I FOLLOWED HIM
HE PUSHED OPEN A HALF CLOSED DOOR AND WE BOTH STOOD APPALLED AT THE
SIGHT BEFORE US
A WOMAN YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WAS LYING DEAD UPON THE BED
HER CALM PALE
FACE WITH DIM WIDE OPENED BLUE EYES LOOKED UPWARD FROM AMID A GREAT
TANGLE OF GOLDEN HAIR
AT THE FOOT OF THE BED HALF SITTING HALF
KNEELING HIS FACE BURIED IN THE CLOTHES WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOSE FRAME
WAS RACKED BY HIS SOBS
SO ABSORBED WAS HE BY HIS BITTER GRIEF THAT HE
NEVER LOOKED UP UNTIL HOLMES'S HAND WAS ON HIS SHOULDER
ARE YOU MR
GODFREY STAUNTON
YES YES I AM BUT YOU ARE TOO LATE
SHE IS DEAD
THE MAN WAS SO DAZED THAT HE COULD NOT BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE
WERE ANYTHING BUT DOCTORS WHO HAD BEEN SENT TO HIS ASSISTANCE
HOLMES
WAS ENDEAVOURING TO UTTER A FEW WORDS OF CONSOLATION AND TO EXPLAIN THE
ALARM WHICH HAD BEEN CAUSED TO HIS FRIENDS BY HIS SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE
WHEN THERE WAS A STEP UPON THE STAIRS AND THERE WAS THE HEAVY STERN
QUESTIONING FACE OF DR
ARMSTRONG AT THE DOOR
SO GENTLEMEN SAID HE YOU HAVE ATTAINED YOUR END AND HAVE CERTAINLY
CHOSEN A PARTICULARLY DELICATE MOMENT FOR YOUR INTRUSION
I WOULD NOT
BRAWL IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IF I WERE A
YOUNGER MAN YOUR MONSTROUS CONDUCT WOULD NOT PASS WITH IMPUNITY
EXCUSE ME DR
ARMSTRONG I THINK WE ARE A LITTLE AT CROSS PURPOSES
SAID MY FRIEND WITH DIGNITY
IF YOU COULD STEP DOWNSTAIRS WITH US
WE MAY EACH BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME LIGHT TO THE OTHER UPON THIS MISERABLE
AFFAIR
A MINUTE LATER THE GRIM DOCTOR AND OURSELVES WERE IN THE SITTING ROOM
BELOW
WELL SIR SAID HE
I WISH YOU TO UNDERSTAND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT I AM NOT EMPLOYED
BY LORD MOUNT JAMES AND THAT MY SYMPATHIES IN THIS MATTER ARE ENTIRELY
AGAINST THAT NOBLEMAN
WHEN A MAN IS LOST IT IS MY DUTY TO ASCERTAIN HIS
FATE BUT HAVING DONE SO THE MATTER ENDS SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED AND
SO LONG AS THERE IS NOTHING CRIMINAL I AM MUCH MORE ANXIOUS TO HUSH UP
PRIVATE SCANDALS THAN TO GIVE THEM PUBLICITY
IF AS I IMAGINE THERE IS
NO BREACH OF THE LAW IN THIS MATTER YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY DEPEND UPON MY
DISCRETION AND MY COOPERATION IN KEEPING THE FACTS OUT OF THE PAPERS
DR
ARMSTRONG TOOK A QUICK STEP FORWARD AND WRUNG HOLMES BY THE HAND
YOU ARE A GOOD FELLOW SAID HE
I HAD MISJUDGED YOU
I THANK HEAVEN
THAT MY COMPUNCTION AT LEAVING POOR STAUNTON ALL ALONE IN THIS PLIGHT
CAUSED ME TO TURN MY CARRIAGE BACK AND SO TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
KNOWING AS MUCH AS YOU DO THE SITUATION IS VERY EASILY EXPLAINED
A YEAR AGO GODFREY STAUNTON LODGED IN LONDON FOR A TIME AND BECAME
PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO HIS LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER WHOM HE MARRIED
SHE
WAS AS GOOD AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND AS INTELLIGENT AS SHE WAS GOOD
NO MAN NEED BE ASHAMED OF SUCH A WIFE
BUT GODFREY WAS THE HEIR TO THIS
CRABBED OLD NOBLEMAN AND IT WAS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE NEWS OF HIS
MARRIAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END OF HIS INHERITANCE
I KNEW THE LAD
WELL AND I LOVED HIM FOR HIS MANY EXCELLENT QUALITIES
I DID ALL I
COULD TO HELP HIM TO KEEP THINGS STRAIGHT
WE DID OUR VERY BEST TO KEEP
THE THING FROM EVERYONE FOR WHEN ONCE SUCH A WHISPER GETS ABOUT IT IS
NOT LONG BEFORE EVERYONE HAS HEARD IT
THANKS TO THIS LONELY COTTAGE AND
HIS OWN DISCRETION GODFREY HAS UP TO NOW SUCCEEDED
THEIR SECRET WAS
KNOWN TO NO ONE SAVE TO ME AND TO ONE EXCELLENT SERVANT WHO HAS AT
PRESENT GONE FOR ASSISTANCE TO TRUMPINGTON
BUT AT LAST THERE CAME A
TERRIBLE BLOW IN THE SHAPE OF DANGEROUS ILLNESS TO HIS WIFE
IT WAS
CONSUMPTION OF THE MOST VIRULENT KIND
THE POOR BOY WAS HALF CRAZED WITH
GRIEF AND YET HE HAD TO GO TO LONDON TO PLAY THIS MATCH FOR HE COULD
NOT GET OUT OF IT WITHOUT EXPLANATIONS WHICH WOULD EXPOSE HIS SECRET
I
TRIED TO CHEER HIM UP BY WIRE AND HE SENT ME ONE IN REPLY IMPLORING
ME TO DO ALL I COULD
THIS WAS THE TELEGRAM WHICH YOU APPEAR IN SOME
INEXPLICABLE WAY TO HAVE SEEN
I DID NOT TELL HIM HOW URGENT THE DANGER
WAS FOR I KNEW THAT HE COULD DO NO GOOD HERE BUT I SENT THE TRUTH TO
THE GIRL'S FATHER AND HE VERY INJUDICIOUSLY COMMUNICATED IT TO GODFREY
THE RESULT WAS THAT HE CAME STRAIGHT AWAY IN A STATE BORDERING ON
FRENZY AND HAS REMAINED IN THE SAME STATE KNEELING AT THE END OF HER
BED UNTIL THIS MORNING DEATH PUT AN END TO HER SUFFERINGS
THAT IS ALL
MR
HOLMES AND I AM SURE THAT I CAN RELY UPON YOUR DISCRETION AND THAT
OF YOUR FRIEND
HOLMES GRASPED THE DOCTOR'S HAND
COME WATSON SAID HE AND WE PASSED FROM THAT HOUSE OF GRIEF INTO THE
PALE SUNLIGHT OF THE WINTER DAY
THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE
IT WAS ON A BITTERLY COLD AND FROSTY MORNING TOWARDS THE END OF THE
WINTER OF '97 THAT I WAS AWAKENED BY A TUGGING AT MY SHOULDER
IT WAS
HOLMES
THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND SHONE UPON HIS EAGER STOOPING FACE AND
TOLD ME AT A GLANCE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
COME WATSON COME HE CRIED
THE GAME IS AFOOT
NOT A WORD INTO
YOUR CLOTHES AND COME
TEN MINUTES LATER WE WERE BOTH IN A CAB AND RATTLING THROUGH THE SILENT
STREETS ON OUR WAY TO CHARING CROSS STATION
THE FIRST FAINT WINTER'S
DAWN WAS BEGINNING TO APPEAR AND WE COULD DIMLY SEE THE OCCASIONAL
FIGURE OF AN EARLY WORKMAN AS HE PASSED US BLURRED AND INDISTINCT IN
THE OPALESCENT LONDON REEK
HOLMES NESTLED IN SILENCE INTO HIS HEAVY
COAT AND I WAS GLAD TO DO THE SAME FOR THE AIR WAS MOST BITTER AND
NEITHER OF US HAD BROKEN OUR FAST
IT WAS NOT UNTIL WE HAD CONSUMED SOME HOT TEA AT THE STATION AND TAKEN
OUR PLACES IN THE KENTISH TRAIN THAT WE WERE SUFFICIENTLY THAWED HE
TO SPEAK AND I TO LISTEN
HOLMES DREW A NOTE FROM HIS POCKET AND READ
ALOUD
ABBEY GRANGE MARSHAM KENT 3 30 A M
MY DEAR MR
HOLMES
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD OF YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE IN WHAT PROMISES TO
BE A MOST REMARKABLE CASE
IT IS SOMETHING QUITE IN YOUR LINE
EXCEPT
FOR RELEASING THE LADY I WILL SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS KEPT EXACTLY AS I
HAVE FOUND IT BUT I BEG YOU NOT TO LOSE AN INSTANT AS IT IS DIFFICULT
TO LEAVE SIR EUSTACE THERE
YOURS FAITHFULLY STANLEY HOPKINS
HOPKINS HAS CALLED ME IN SEVEN TIMES AND ON EACH OCCASION HIS SUMMONS
HAS BEEN ENTIRELY JUSTIFIED SAID HOLMES
I FANCY THAT EVERY ONE OF
HIS CASES HAS FOUND ITS WAY INTO YOUR COLLECTION AND I MUST ADMIT
WATSON THAT YOU HAVE SOME POWER OF SELECTION WHICH ATONES FOR MUCH
WHICH I DEPLORE IN YOUR NARRATIVES
YOUR FATAL HABIT OF LOOKING AT
EVERYTHING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A STORY INSTEAD OF AS A SCIENTIFIC
EXERCISE HAS RUINED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN INSTRUCTIVE AND EVEN
CLASSICAL SERIES OF DEMONSTRATIONS
YOU SLUR OVER WORK OF THE UTMOST
FINESSE AND DELICACY IN ORDER TO DWELL UPON SENSATIONAL DETAILS WHICH
MAY EXCITE BUT CANNOT POSSIBLY INSTRUCT THE READER
WHY DO YOU NOT WRITE THEM YOURSELF I SAID WITH SOME BITTERNESS
I WILL MY DEAR WATSON I WILL
AT PRESENT I AM AS YOU KNOW FAIRLY
BUSY BUT I PROPOSE TO DEVOTE MY DECLINING YEARS TO THE COMPOSITION OF A
TEXTBOOK WHICH SHALL FOCUS THE WHOLE ART OF DETECTION INTO ONE VOLUME
OUR PRESENT RESEARCH APPEARS TO BE A CASE OF MURDER
YOU THINK THIS SIR EUSTACE IS DEAD THEN
I SHOULD SAY SO
HOPKINS'S WRITING SHOWS CONSIDERABLE AGITATION AND HE
IS NOT AN EMOTIONAL MAN
YES I GATHER THERE HAS BEEN VIOLENCE AND
THAT THE BODY IS LEFT FOR OUR INSPECTION
A MERE SUICIDE WOULD NOT
HAVE CAUSED HIM TO SEND FOR ME
AS TO THE RELEASE OF THE LADY IT WOULD
APPEAR THAT SHE HAS BEEN LOCKED IN HER ROOM DURING THE TRAGEDY
WE
ARE MOVING IN HIGH LIFE WATSON CRACKLING PAPER 'E B MONOGRAM
COAT OF ARMS PICTURESQUE ADDRESS
I THINK THAT FRIEND HOPKINS WILL LIVE
UP TO HIS REPUTATION AND THAT WE SHALL HAVE AN INTERESTING MORNING
THE
CRIME WAS COMMITTED BEFORE TWELVE LAST NIGHT
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY TELL
BY AN INSPECTION OF THE TRAINS AND BY RECKONING THE TIME
THE LOCAL
POLICE HAD TO BE CALLED IN THEY HAD TO COMMUNICATE WITH SCOTLAND YARD
HOPKINS HAD TO GO OUT AND HE IN TURN HAD TO SEND FOR ME
ALL THAT MAKES
A FAIR NIGHT'S WORK
WELL HERE WE ARE AT CHISELHURST STATION AND WE
SHALL SOON SET OUR DOUBTS AT REST
A DRIVE OF A COUPLE OF MILES THROUGH NARROW COUNTRY LANES BROUGHT US
TO A PARK GATE WHICH WAS OPENED FOR US BY AN OLD LODGE KEEPER WHOSE
HAGGARD FACE BORE THE REFLECTION OF SOME GREAT DISASTER
THE AVENUE RAN
THROUGH A NOBLE PARK BETWEEN LINES OF ANCIENT ELMS AND ENDED IN A LOW
WIDESPREAD HOUSE PILLARED IN FRONT AFTER THE FASHION OF PALLADIO
THE
CENTRAL PART WAS EVIDENTLY OF A GREAT AGE AND SHROUDED IN IVY BUT THE
LARGE WINDOWS SHOWED THAT MODERN CHANGES HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT AND ONE
WING OF THE HOUSE APPEARED TO BE ENTIRELY NEW
THE YOUTHFUL FIGURE AND
ALERT EAGER FACE OF INSPECTOR STANLEY HOPKINS CONFRONTED US IN THE OPEN
DOORWAY
I'M VERY GLAD YOU HAVE COME MR
HOLMES
AND YOU TOO DR
WATSON
BUT
INDEED IF I HAD MY TIME OVER AGAIN I SHOULD NOT HAVE TROUBLED YOU FOR
SINCE THE LADY HAS COME TO HERSELF SHE HAS GIVEN SO CLEAR AN ACCOUNT OF
THE AFFAIR THAT THERE IS NOT MUCH LEFT FOR US TO DO
YOU REMEMBER THAT
LEWISHAM GANG OF BURGLARS
WHAT THE THREE RANDALLS
EXACTLY THE FATHER AND TWO SONS
IT'S THEIR WORK
I HAVE NOT A DOUBT
OF IT
THEY DID A JOB AT SYDENHAM A FORTNIGHT AGO AND WERE SEEN AND
DESCRIBED
RATHER COOL TO DO ANOTHER SO SOON AND SO NEAR BUT IT IS
THEY BEYOND ALL DOUBT
IT'S A HANGING MATTER THIS TIME
SIR EUSTACE IS DEAD THEN
YES HIS HEAD WAS KNOCKED IN WITH HIS OWN POKER
SIR EUSTACE BRACKENSTALL THE DRIVER TELLS ME
EXACTLY ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN KENT LADY BRACKENSTALL IS IN THE
MORNING ROOM
POOR LADY SHE HAS HAD A MOST DREADFUL EXPERIENCE
SHE
SEEMED HALF DEAD WHEN I SAW HER FIRST
I THINK YOU HAD BEST SEE HER
AND HEAR HER ACCOUNT OF THE FACTS
THEN WE WILL EXAMINE THE DINING ROOM
TOGETHER
LADY BRACKENSTALL WAS NO ORDINARY PERSON
SELDOM HAVE I SEEN SO GRACEFUL
A FIGURE SO WOMANLY A PRESENCE AND SO BEAUTIFUL A FACE
SHE WAS
A BLONDE GOLDEN HAIRED BLUE EYED AND WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE HAD THE
PERFECT COMPLEXION WHICH GOES WITH SUCH COLOURING HAD NOT HER RECENT
EXPERIENCE LEFT HER DRAWN AND HAGGARD
HER SUFFERINGS WERE PHYSICAL AS
WELL AS MENTAL FOR OVER ONE EYE ROSE A HIDEOUS PLUM COLOURED SWELLING
WHICH HER MAID A TALL AUSTERE WOMAN WAS BATHING ASSIDUOUSLY WITH
VINEGAR AND WATER
THE LADY LAY BACK EXHAUSTED UPON A COUCH BUT HER
QUICK OBSERVANT GAZE AS WE ENTERED THE ROOM AND THE ALERT EXPRESSION
OF HER BEAUTIFUL FEATURES SHOWED THAT NEITHER HER WITS NOR HER COURAGE
HAD BEEN SHAKEN BY HER TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
SHE WAS ENVELOPED IN A
LOOSE DRESSING GOWN OF BLUE AND SILVER BUT A BLACK SEQUIN COVERED
DINNER DRESS LAY UPON THE COUCH BESIDE HER
I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL THAT HAPPENED MR
HOPKINS SHE SAID WEARILY
COULD YOU NOT REPEAT IT FOR ME WELL IF YOU THINK IT NECESSARY I WILL
TELL THESE GENTLEMEN WHAT OCCURRED
HAVE THEY BEEN IN THE DINING ROOM
YET
I THOUGHT THEY HAD BETTER HEAR YOUR LADYSHIP'S STORY FIRST
I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN YOU CAN ARRANGE MATTERS
IT IS HORRIBLE TO ME TO
THINK OF HIM STILL LYING THERE SHE SHUDDERED AND BURIED HER FACE IN
HER HANDS
AS SHE DID SO THE LOOSE GOWN FELL BACK FROM HER FOREARMS
HOLMES UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION
YOU HAVE OTHER INJURIES MADAM WHAT IS THIS TWO VIVID RED SPOTS
STOOD OUT ON ONE OF THE WHITE ROUND LIMBS
SHE HASTILY COVERED IT
IT IS NOTHING
IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THIS HIDEOUS BUSINESS
TO NIGHT
IF YOU AND YOUR FRIEND WILL SIT DOWN I WILL TELL YOU ALL I
CAN
I AM THE WIFE OF SIR EUSTACE BRACKENSTALL
I HAVE BEEN MARRIED ABOUT
A YEAR
I SUPPOSE THAT IT IS NO USE MY ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL THAT OUR
MARRIAGE HAS NOT BEEN A HAPPY ONE
I FEAR THAT ALL OUR NEIGHBOURS WOULD
TELL YOU THAT EVEN IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT TO DENY IT
PERHAPS THE FAULT
MAY BE PARTLY MINE
I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE FREER LESS CONVENTIONAL
ATMOSPHERE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND THIS ENGLISH LIFE WITH ITS
PROPRIETIES AND ITS PRIMNESS IS NOT CONGENIAL TO ME
BUT THE MAIN
REASON LIES IN THE ONE FACT WHICH IS NOTORIOUS TO EVERYONE AND THAT IS
THAT SIR EUSTACE WAS A CONFIRMED DRUNKARD
TO BE WITH SUCH A MAN FOR AN
HOUR IS UNPLEASANT
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT MEANS FOR A SENSITIVE
AND HIGH SPIRITED WOMAN TO BE TIED TO HIM FOR DAY AND NIGHT IT IS A
SACRILEGE A CRIME A VILLAINY TO HOLD THAT SUCH A MARRIAGE IS BINDING
I SAY THAT THESE MONSTROUS LAWS OF YOURS WILL BRING A CURSE UPON THE
LAND GOD WILL NOT LET SUCH WICKEDNESS ENDURE FOR AN INSTANT SHE SAT
UP HER CHEEKS FLUSHED AND HER EYES BLAZING FROM UNDER THE TERRIBLE
MARK UPON HER BROW
THEN THE STRONG SOOTHING HAND OF THE AUSTERE MAID
DREW HER HEAD DOWN ON TO THE CUSHION AND THE WILD ANGER DIED AWAY INTO
PASSIONATE SOBBING
AT LAST SHE CONTINUED
I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT
YOU ARE AWARE PERHAPS THAT IN THIS
HOUSE ALL THE SERVANTS SLEEP IN THE MODERN WING
THIS CENTRAL BLOCK IS
MADE UP OF THE DWELLING ROOMS WITH THE KITCHEN BEHIND AND OUR BEDROOM
ABOVE
MY MAID THERESA SLEEPS ABOVE MY ROOM
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE AND
NO SOUND COULD ALARM THOSE WHO ARE IN THE FARTHER WING
THIS MUST HAVE
BEEN WELL KNOWN TO THE ROBBERS OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ACTED AS THEY
DID
SIR EUSTACE RETIRED ABOUT HALF PAST TEN
THE SERVANTS HAD ALREADY GONE
TO THEIR QUARTERS
ONLY MY MAID WAS UP AND SHE HAD REMAINED IN HER ROOM
AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE UNTIL I NEEDED HER SERVICES
I SAT UNTIL AFTER
ELEVEN IN THIS ROOM ABSORBED IN A BOOK
THEN I WALKED ROUND TO SEE
THAT ALL WAS RIGHT BEFORE I WENT UPSTAIRS
IT WAS MY CUSTOM TO DO THIS
MYSELF FOR AS I HAVE EXPLAINED SIR EUSTACE WAS NOT ALWAYS TO BE
TRUSTED
I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN THE BUTLER'S PANTRY THE GUN ROOM
THE BILLIARD ROOM THE DRAWING ROOM AND FINALLY THE DINING ROOM
AS I
APPROACHED THE WINDOW WHICH IS COVERED WITH THICK CURTAINS I SUDDENLY
FELT THE WIND BLOW UPON MY FACE AND REALIZED THAT IT WAS OPEN
I FLUNG
THE CURTAIN ASIDE AND FOUND MYSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A BROAD SHOULDERED
ELDERLY MAN WHO HAD JUST STEPPED INTO THE ROOM
THE WINDOW IS A LONG
FRENCH ONE WHICH REALLY FORMS A DOOR LEADING TO THE LAWN
I HELD MY
BEDROOM CANDLE LIT IN MY HAND AND BY ITS LIGHT BEHIND THE FIRST MAN I
SAW TWO OTHERS WHO WERE IN THE ACT OF ENTERING
I STEPPED BACK BUT THE
FELLOW WAS ON ME IN AN INSTANT
HE CAUGHT ME FIRST BY THE WRIST AND THEN
BY THE THROAT
I OPENED MY MOUTH TO SCREAM BUT HE STRUCK ME A SAVAGE
BLOW WITH HIS FIST OVER THE EYE AND FELLED ME TO THE GROUND
I MUST
HAVE BEEN UNCONSCIOUS FOR A FEW MINUTES FOR WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF I
FOUND THAT THEY HAD TORN DOWN THE BELL ROPE AND HAD SECURED ME TIGHTLY
TO THE OAKEN CHAIR WHICH STANDS AT THE HEAD OF THE DINING TABLE
I WAS
SO FIRMLY BOUND THAT I COULD NOT MOVE AND A HANDKERCHIEF ROUND MY
MOUTH PREVENTED ME FROM UTTERING A SOUND
IT WAS AT THIS INSTANT THAT
MY UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND ENTERED THE ROOM
HE HAD EVIDENTLY HEARD SOME
SUSPICIOUS SOUNDS AND HE CAME PREPARED FOR SUCH A SCENE AS HE FOUND
HE WAS DRESSED IN NIGHTSHIRT AND TROUSERS WITH HIS FAVOURITE BLACKTHORN
CUDGEL IN HIS HAND
HE RUSHED AT THE BURGLARS BUT ANOTHER IT WAS AN
ELDERLY MAN STOOPED PICKED THE POKER OUT OF THE GRATE AND STRUCK HIM A
HORRIBLE BLOW AS HE PASSED
HE FELL WITH A GROAN AND NEVER MOVED AGAIN
I FAINTED ONCE MORE BUT AGAIN IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN FOR A VERY FEW
MINUTES DURING WHICH I WAS INSENSIBLE
WHEN I OPENED MY EYES I FOUND
THAT THEY HAD COLLECTED THE SILVER FROM THE SIDEBOARD AND THEY HAD
DRAWN A BOTTLE OF WINE WHICH STOOD THERE
EACH OF THEM HAD A GLASS IN
HIS HAND
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU HAVE I NOT THAT ONE WAS ELDERLY
WITH A BEARD AND THE OTHERS YOUNG HAIRLESS LADS
THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A FATHER WITH HIS TWO SONS
THEY TALKED TOGETHER IN WHISPERS
THEN
THEY CAME OVER AND MADE SURE THAT I WAS SECURELY BOUND
FINALLY THEY
WITHDREW CLOSING THE WINDOW AFTER THEM
IT WAS QUITE A QUARTER OF AN
HOUR BEFORE I GOT MY MOUTH FREE
WHEN I DID SO MY SCREAMS BROUGHT THE
MAID TO MY ASSISTANCE
THE OTHER SERVANTS WERE SOON ALARMED AND WE SENT
FOR THE LOCAL POLICE WHO INSTANTLY COMMUNICATED WITH LONDON
THAT IS
REALLY ALL THAT I CAN TELL YOU GENTLEMEN AND I TRUST THAT IT WILL NOT
BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO GO OVER SO PAINFUL A STORY AGAIN
ANY QUESTIONS MR
HOLMES ASKED HOPKINS
I WILL NOT IMPOSE ANY FURTHER TAX UPON LADY BRACKENSTALL'S PATIENCE AND
TIME SAID HOLMES
BEFORE I GO INTO THE DINING ROOM I SHOULD LIKE TO
HEAR YOUR EXPERIENCE HE LOOKED AT THE MAID
I SAW THE MEN BEFORE EVER THEY CAME INTO THE HOUSE SAID SHE
AS I
SAT BY MY BEDROOM WINDOW I SAW THREE MEN IN THE MOONLIGHT DOWN BY THE
LODGE GATE YONDER BUT I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT AT THE TIME
IT WAS MORE
THAN AN HOUR AFTER THAT I HEARD MY MISTRESS SCREAM AND DOWN I RAN TO
FIND HER POOR LAMB JUST AS SHE SAYS AND HIM ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS
BLOOD AND BRAINS OVER THE ROOM
IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE A WOMAN OUT OF
HER WITS TIED THERE AND HER VERY DRESS SPOTTED WITH HIM BUT SHE NEVER
WANTED COURAGE DID MISS MARY FRASER OF ADELAIDE AND LADY BRACKENSTALL
OF ABBEY GRANGE HASN'T LEARNED NEW WAYS
YOU'VE QUESTIONED HER LONG
ENOUGH YOU GENTLEMEN AND NOW SHE IS COMING TO HER OWN ROOM JUST WITH
HER OLD THERESA TO GET THE REST THAT SHE BADLY NEEDS
WITH A MOTHERLY TENDERNESS THE GAUNT WOMAN PUT HER ARM ROUND HER
MISTRESS AND LED HER FROM THE ROOM
SHE HAS BEEN WITH HER ALL HER LIFE SAID HOPKINS
NURSED HER AS
A BABY AND CAME WITH HER TO ENGLAND WHEN THEY FIRST LEFT AUSTRALIA
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO
THERESA WRIGHT IS HER NAME AND THE KIND OF MAID
YOU DON'T PICK UP NOWADAYS
THIS WAY MR
HOLMES IF YOU PLEASE
THE KEEN INTEREST HAD PASSED OUT OF HOLMES'S EXPRESSIVE FACE AND I
KNEW THAT WITH THE MYSTERY ALL THE CHARM OF THE CASE HAD DEPARTED
THERE
STILL REMAINED AN ARREST TO BE EFFECTED BUT WHAT WERE THESE COMMONPLACE
ROGUES THAT HE SHOULD SOIL HIS HANDS WITH THEM AN ABSTRUSE AND LEARNED
SPECIALIST WHO FINDS THAT HE HAS BEEN CALLED IN FOR A CASE OF MEASLES
WOULD EXPERIENCE SOMETHING OF THE ANNOYANCE WHICH I READ IN MY
FRIEND'S EYES
YET THE SCENE IN THE DINING ROOM OF THE ABBEY GRANGE WAS
SUFFICIENTLY STRANGE TO ARREST HIS ATTENTION AND TO RECALL HIS WANING
INTEREST
IT WAS A VERY LARGE AND HIGH CHAMBER WITH CARVED OAK CEILING OAKEN
PANELLING AND A FINE ARRAY OF DEER'S HEADS AND ANCIENT WEAPONS AROUND
THE WALLS
AT THE FURTHER END FROM THE DOOR WAS THE HIGH FRENCH WINDOW
OF WHICH WE HAD HEARD
THREE SMALLER WINDOWS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE
FILLED THE APARTMENT WITH COLD WINTER SUNSHINE
ON THE LEFT WAS A LARGE
DEEP FIREPLACE WITH A MASSIVE OVERHANGING OAK MANTELPIECE
BESIDE
THE FIREPLACE WAS A HEAVY OAKEN CHAIR WITH ARMS AND CROSS BARS AT THE
BOTTOM
IN AND OUT THROUGH THE OPEN WOODWORK WAS WOVEN A CRIMSON CORD
WHICH WAS SECURED AT EACH SIDE TO THE CROSSPIECE BELOW
IN RELEASING THE
LADY THE CORD HAD BEEN SLIPPED OFF HER BUT THE KNOTS WITH WHICH IT
HAD BEEN SECURED STILL REMAINED
THESE DETAILS ONLY STRUCK OUR ATTENTION
AFTERWARDS FOR OUR THOUGHTS WERE ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY THE TERRIBLE
OBJECT WHICH LAY UPON THE TIGERSKIN HEARTHRUG IN FRONT OF THE FIRE
IT WAS THE BODY OF A TALL WELL MADE MAN ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
HE LAY UPON HIS BACK HIS FACE UPTURNED WITH HIS WHITE TEETH GRINNING
THROUGH HIS SHORT BLACK BEARD
HIS TWO CLENCHED HANDS WERE RAISED
ABOVE HIS HEAD AND A HEAVY BLACKTHORN STICK LAY ACROSS THEM
HIS DARK
HANDSOME AQUILINE FEATURES WERE CONVULSED INTO A SPASM OF VINDICTIVE
HATRED WHICH HAD SET HIS DEAD FACE IN A TERRIBLY FIENDISH EXPRESSION
HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN IN HIS BED WHEN THE ALARM HAD BROKEN OUT FOR HE
WORE A FOPPISH EMBROIDERED NIGHTSHIRT AND HIS BARE FEET PROJECTED FROM
HIS TROUSERS
HIS HEAD WAS HORRIBLY INJURED AND THE WHOLE ROOM BORE
WITNESS TO THE SAVAGE FEROCITY OF THE BLOW WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM DOWN
BESIDE HIM LAY THE HEAVY POKER BENT INTO A CURVE BY THE CONCUSSION
HOLMES EXAMINED BOTH IT AND THE INDESCRIBABLE WRECK WHICH IT HAD
WROUGHT
HE MUST BE A POWERFUL MAN THIS ELDER RANDALL HE REMARKED
YES SAID HOPKINS
I HAVE SOME RECORD OF THE FELLOW AND HE IS A
ROUGH CUSTOMER
YOU SHOULD HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING HIM
NOT THE SLIGHTEST
WE HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HIM AND THERE WAS
SOME IDEA THAT HE HAD GOT AWAY TO AMERICA
NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THE
GANG ARE HERE I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN ESCAPE
WE HAVE THE NEWS AT
EVERY SEAPORT ALREADY AND A REWARD WILL BE OFFERED BEFORE EVENING
WHAT
BEATS ME IS HOW THEY COULD HAVE DONE SO MAD A THING KNOWING THAT THE
LADY COULD DESCRIBE THEM AND THAT WE COULD NOT FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THE
DESCRIPTION
EXACTLY
ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD SILENCE LADY
BRACKENSTALL AS WELL
THEY MAY NOT HAVE REALIZED I SUGGESTED THAT SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM
HER FAINT
THAT IS LIKELY ENOUGH
IF SHE SEEMED TO BE SENSELESS THEY WOULD NOT
TAKE HER LIFE
WHAT ABOUT THIS POOR FELLOW HOPKINS I SEEM TO HAVE
HEARD SOME QUEER STORIES ABOUT HIM
HE WAS A GOOD HEARTED MAN WHEN HE WAS SOBER BUT A PERFECT FIEND WHEN
HE WAS DRUNK OR RATHER WHEN HE WAS HALF DRUNK FOR HE SELDOM REALLY
WENT THE WHOLE WAY
THE DEVIL SEEMED TO BE IN HIM AT SUCH TIMES AND HE
WAS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING
FROM WHAT I HEAR IN SPITE OF ALL HIS WEALTH
AND HIS TITLE HE VERY NEARLY CAME OUR WAY ONCE OR TWICE
THERE WAS
A SCANDAL ABOUT HIS DRENCHING A DOG WITH PETROLEUM AND SETTING IT ON
FIRE HER LADYSHIP'S DOG TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE AND THAT WAS ONLY
HUSHED UP WITH DIFFICULTY
THEN HE THREW A DECANTER AT THAT MAID
THERESA WRIGHT THERE WAS TROUBLE ABOUT THAT
ON THE WHOLE AND BETWEEN
OURSELVES IT WILL BE A BRIGHTER HOUSE WITHOUT HIM
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT NOW
HOLMES WAS DOWN ON HIS KNEES EXAMINING WITH GREAT ATTENTION THE
KNOTS UPON THE RED CORD WITH WHICH THE LADY HAD BEEN SECURED
THEN HE
CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZED THE BROKEN AND FRAYED END WHERE IT HAD SNAPPED OFF
WHEN THE BURGLAR HAD DRAGGED IT DOWN
WHEN THIS WAS PULLED DOWN THE BELL IN THE KITCHEN MUST HAVE RUNG
LOUDLY HE REMARKED
NO ONE COULD HEAR IT
THE KITCHEN STANDS RIGHT AT THE BACK OF THE
HOUSE
HOW DID THE BURGLAR KNOW NO ONE WOULD HEAR IT HOW DARED HE PULL AT A
BELL ROPE IN THAT RECKLESS FASHION
EXACTLY MR
HOLMES EXACTLY
YOU PUT THE VERY QUESTION WHICH I HAVE
ASKED MYSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THIS FELLOW
MUST HAVE KNOWN THE HOUSE AND ITS HABITS
HE MUST HAVE PERFECTLY
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE SERVANTS WOULD ALL BE IN BED AT THAT COMPARATIVELY
EARLY HOUR AND THAT NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY HEAR A BELL RING IN THE
KITCHEN
THEREFORE HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH ONE OF THE
SERVANTS
SURELY THAT IS EVIDENT
BUT THERE ARE EIGHT SERVANTS AND ALL
OF GOOD CHARACTER
OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL SAID HOLMES ONE WOULD SUSPECT THE ONE
AT WHOSE HEAD THE MASTER THREW A DECANTER
AND YET THAT WOULD INVOLVE
TREACHERY TOWARDS THE MISTRESS TO WHOM THIS WOMAN SEEMS DEVOTED
WELL
WELL THE POINT IS A MINOR ONE AND WHEN YOU HAVE RANDALL YOU WILL
PROBABLY FIND NO DIFFICULTY IN SECURING HIS ACCOMPLICE
THE LADY'S STORY
CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE CORROBORATED IF IT NEEDED CORROBORATION BY EVERY
DETAIL WHICH WE SEE BEFORE US HE WALKED TO THE FRENCH WINDOW AND THREW
IT OPEN
THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE BUT THE GROUND IS IRON HARD AND ONE
WOULD NOT EXPECT THEM
I SEE THAT THESE CANDLES IN THE MANTELPIECE HAVE
BEEN LIGHTED
YES IT WAS BY THEIR LIGHT AND THAT OF THE LADY'S BEDROOM CANDLE THAT
THE BURGLARS SAW THEIR WAY ABOUT
AND WHAT DID THEY TAKE
WELL THEY DID NOT TAKE MUCH ONLY HALF A DOZEN ARTICLES OF PLATE OFF
THE SIDEBOARD
LADY BRACKENSTALL THINKS THAT THEY WERE THEMSELVES SO
DISTURBED BY THE DEATH OF SIR EUSTACE THAT THEY DID NOT RANSACK THE
HOUSE AS THEY WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
NO DOUBT THAT IS TRUE AND YET THEY DRANK SOME WINE I UNDERSTAND
TO STEADY THEIR NERVES
EXACTLY
THESE THREE GLASSES UPON THE SIDEBOARD HAVE BEEN UNTOUCHED I
SUPPOSE
YES AND THE BOTTLE STANDS AS THEY LEFT IT
LET US LOOK AT IT
HALLOA HALLOA WHAT IS THIS
THE THREE GLASSES WERE GROUPED TOGETHER ALL OF THEM TINGED WITH WINE
AND ONE OF THEM CONTAINING SOME DREGS OF BEESWING
THE BOTTLE STOOD NEAR
THEM TWO THIRDS FULL AND BESIDE IT LAY A LONG DEEPLY STAINED CORK
ITS APPEARANCE AND THE DUST UPON THE BOTTLE SHOWED THAT IT WAS NO COMMON
VINTAGE WHICH THE MURDERERS HAD ENJOYED
A CHANGE HAD COME OVER HOLMES'S MANNER
HE HAD LOST HIS LISTLESS
EXPRESSION AND AGAIN I SAW AN ALERT LIGHT OF INTEREST IN HIS KEEN
DEEP SET EYES
HE RAISED THE CORK AND EXAMINED IT MINUTELY
HOW DID THEY DRAW IT HE ASKED
HOPKINS POINTED TO A HALF OPENED DRAWER
IN IT LAY SOME TABLE LINEN AND
A LARGE CORKSCREW
DID LADY BRACKENSTALL SAY THAT SCREW WAS USED
NO YOU REMEMBER THAT SHE WAS SENSELESS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE BOTTLE
WAS OPENED
QUITE SO
AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT SCREW WAS NOT USED
THIS BOTTLE WAS
OPENED BY A POCKET SCREW PROBABLY CONTAINED IN A KNIFE AND NOT MORE
THAN AN INCH AND A HALF LONG
IF YOU WILL EXAMINE THE TOP OF THE CORK
YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THE SCREW WAS DRIVEN IN THREE TIMES BEFORE THE
CORK WAS EXTRACTED
IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRANSFIXED
THIS LONG SCREW WOULD
HAVE TRANSFIXED IT AND DRAWN IT UP WITH A SINGLE PULL
WHEN YOU CATCH
THIS FELLOW YOU WILL FIND THAT HE HAS ONE OF THESE MULTIPLEX KNIVES IN
HIS POSSESSION
EXCELLENT SAID HOPKINS
BUT THESE GLASSES DO PUZZLE ME I CONFESS
LADY BRACKENSTALL ACTUALLY
SAW THE THREE MEN DRINKING DID SHE NOT
YES SHE WAS CLEAR ABOUT THAT
THEN THERE IS AN END OF IT
WHAT MORE IS TO BE SAID AND YET YOU MUST
ADMIT THAT THE THREE GLASSES ARE VERY REMARKABLE HOPKINS
WHAT YOU
SEE NOTHING REMARKABLE WELL WELL LET IT PASS
PERHAPS WHEN A MAN HAS
SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE AND SPECIAL POWERS LIKE MY OWN IT RATHER ENCOURAGES
HIM TO SEEK A COMPLEX EXPLANATION WHEN A SIMPLER ONE IS AT HAND
OF
COURSE IT MUST BE A MERE CHANCE ABOUT THE GLASSES
WELL GOOD MORNING
HOPKINS
I DON'T SEE THAT I CAN BE OF ANY USE TO YOU AND YOU APPEAR
TO HAVE YOUR CASE VERY CLEAR
YOU WILL LET ME KNOW WHEN RANDALL IS
ARRESTED AND ANY FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY OCCUR
I TRUST THAT I
SHALL SOON HAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU UPON A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION
COME
WATSON I FANCY THAT WE MAY EMPLOY OURSELVES MORE PROFITABLY AT HOME
DURING OUR RETURN JOURNEY I COULD SEE BY HOLMES'S FACE THAT HE WAS MUCH
PUZZLED BY SOMETHING WHICH HE HAD OBSERVED
EVERY NOW AND THEN BY AN
EFFORT HE WOULD THROW OFF THE IMPRESSION AND TALK AS IF THE MATTER
WERE CLEAR BUT THEN HIS DOUBTS WOULD SETTLE DOWN UPON HIM AGAIN AND
HIS KNITTED BROWS AND ABSTRACTED EYES WOULD SHOW THAT HIS THOUGHTS HAD
GONE BACK ONCE MORE TO THE GREAT DINING ROOM OF THE ABBEY GRANGE IN
WHICH THIS MIDNIGHT TRAGEDY HAD BEEN ENACTED
AT LAST BY A SUDDEN
IMPULSE JUST AS OUR TRAIN WAS CRAWLING OUT OF A SUBURBAN STATION HE
SPRANG ON TO THE PLATFORM AND PULLED ME OUT AFTER HIM
EXCUSE ME MY DEAR FELLOW SAID HE AS WE WATCHED THE REAR CARRIAGES
OF OUR TRAIN DISAPPEARING ROUND A CURVE I AM SORRY TO MAKE YOU THE
VICTIM OF WHAT MAY SEEM A MERE WHIM BUT ON MY LIFE WATSON I SIMPLY
CAN'T LEAVE THAT CASE IN THIS CONDITION
EVERY INSTINCT THAT I POSSESS
CRIES OUT AGAINST IT
IT'S WRONG IT'S ALL WRONG I'LL SWEAR THAT IT'S
WRONG
AND YET THE LADY'S STORY WAS COMPLETE THE MAID'S CORROBORATION
WAS SUFFICIENT THE DETAIL WAS FAIRLY EXACT
WHAT HAVE I TO PUT UP
AGAINST THAT THREE WINE GLASSES THAT IS ALL
BUT IF I HAD NOT TAKEN
THINGS FOR GRANTED IF I HAD EXAMINED EVERYTHING WITH THE CARE WHICH
I SHOULD HAVE SHOWN HAD WE APPROACHED THE CASE DE NOVO AND HAD NO
CUT AND DRIED STORY TO WARP MY MIND SHOULD I NOT THEN HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING MORE DEFINITE TO GO UPON OF COURSE I SHOULD
SIT DOWN ON THIS
BENCH WATSON UNTIL A TRAIN FOR CHISELHURST ARRIVES AND ALLOW ME TO
LAY THE EVIDENCE BEFORE YOU IMPLORING YOU IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO
DISMISS FROM YOUR MIND THE IDEA THAT ANYTHING WHICH THE MAID OR HER
MISTRESS MAY HAVE SAID MUST NECESSARILY BE TRUE
THE LADY'S CHARMING
PERSONALITY MUST NOT BE PERMITTED TO WARP OUR JUDGMENT
SURELY THERE ARE DETAILS IN HER STORY WHICH IF WE LOOKED AT IN COLD
BLOOD WOULD EXCITE OUR SUSPICION
THESE BURGLARS MADE A CONSIDERABLE
HAUL AT SYDENHAM A FORTNIGHT AGO
SOME ACCOUNT OF THEM AND OF THEIR
APPEARANCE WAS IN THE PAPERS AND WOULD NATURALLY OCCUR TO ANYONE WHO
WISHED TO INVENT A STORY IN WHICH IMAGINARY ROBBERS SHOULD PLAY A PART
AS A MATTER OF FACT BURGLARS WHO HAVE DONE A GOOD STROKE OF BUSINESS
ARE AS A RULE ONLY TOO GLAD TO ENJOY THE PROCEEDS IN PEACE AND QUIET
WITHOUT EMBARKING ON ANOTHER PERILOUS UNDERTAKING
AGAIN IT IS UNUSUAL
FOR BURGLARS TO OPERATE AT SO EARLY AN HOUR IT IS UNUSUAL FOR BURGLARS
TO STRIKE A LADY TO PREVENT HER SCREAMING SINCE ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT
WAS THE SURE WAY TO MAKE HER SCREAM IT IS UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO COMMIT
MURDER WHEN THEIR NUMBERS ARE SUFFICIENT TO OVERPOWER ONE MAN IT IS
UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO BE CONTENT WITH A LIMITED PLUNDER WHEN THERE WAS
MUCH MORE WITHIN THEIR REACH AND FINALLY I SHOULD SAY THAT IT WAS
VERY UNUSUAL FOR SUCH MEN TO LEAVE A BOTTLE HALF EMPTY
HOW DO ALL THESE
UNUSUALS STRIKE YOU WATSON
THEIR CUMULATIVE EFFECT IS CERTAINLY CONSIDERABLE AND YET EACH OF THEM
IS QUITE POSSIBLE IN ITSELF
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING OF ALL AS IT SEEMS
TO ME IS THAT THE LADY SHOULD BE TIED TO THE CHAIR
WELL I AM NOT SO CLEAR ABOUT THAT WATSON FOR IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY
MUST EITHER KILL HER OR ELSE SECURE HER IN SUCH A WAY THAT SHE COULD
NOT GIVE IMMEDIATE NOTICE OF THEIR ESCAPE
BUT AT ANY RATE I HAVE SHOWN
HAVE I NOT THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF IMPROBABILITY ABOUT THE
LADY'S STORY AND NOW ON THE TOP OF THIS COMES THE INCIDENT OF THE
WINEGLASSES
WHAT ABOUT THE WINEGLASSES
CAN YOU SEE THEM IN YOUR MIND'S EYE
I SEE THEM CLEARLY
WE ARE TOLD THAT THREE MEN DRANK FROM THEM
DOES THAT STRIKE YOU AS
LIKELY
WHY NOT THERE WAS WINE IN EACH GLASS
EXACTLY BUT THERE WAS BEESWING ONLY IN ONE GLASS
YOU MUST HAVE
NOTICED THAT FACT
WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOUR MIND
THE LAST GLASS FILLED WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO CONTAIN BEESWING
NOT AT ALL
THE BOTTLE WAS FULL OF IT AND IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT
THE FIRST TWO GLASSES WERE CLEAR AND THE THIRD HEAVILY CHARGED WITH IT
THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS AND ONLY TWO
ONE IS THAT AFTER THE
SECOND GLASS WAS FILLED THE BOTTLE WAS VIOLENTLY AGITATED AND SO THE
THIRD GLASS RECEIVED THE BEESWING
THAT DOES NOT APPEAR PROBABLE
NO
NO I AM SURE THAT I AM RIGHT
WHAT THEN DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT ONLY TWO GLASSES WERE USED AND THAT THE DREGS OF BOTH WERE POURED
INTO A THIRD GLASS SO AS TO GIVE THE FALSE IMPRESSION THAT THREE PEOPLE
HAD BEEN HERE
IN THAT WAY ALL THE BEESWING WOULD BE IN THE LAST GLASS
WOULD IT NOT YES I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS IS SO
BUT IF I HAVE HIT
UPON THE TRUE EXPLANATION OF THIS ONE SMALL PHENOMENON THEN IN
AN INSTANT THE CASE RISES FROM THE COMMONPLACE TO THE EXCEEDINGLY
REMARKABLE FOR IT CAN ONLY MEAN THAT LADY BRACKENSTALL AND HER MAID
HAVE DELIBERATELY LIED TO US THAT NOT ONE WORD OF THEIR STORY IS TO BE
BELIEVED THAT THEY HAVE SOME VERY STRONG REASON FOR COVERING THE REAL
CRIMINAL AND THAT WE MUST CONSTRUCT OUR CASE FOR OURSELVES WITHOUT ANY
HELP FROM THEM
THAT IS THE MISSION WHICH NOW LIES BEFORE US AND HERE
WATSON IS THE SYDENHAM TRAIN
THE HOUSEHOLD AT THE ABBEY GRANGE WERE MUCH SURPRISED AT OUR RETURN BUT
SHERLOCK HOLMES FINDING THAT STANLEY HOPKINS HAD GONE OFF TO REPORT TO
HEADQUARTERS TOOK POSSESSION OF THE DINING ROOM LOCKED THE DOOR UPON
THE INSIDE AND DEVOTED HIMSELF FOR TWO HOURS TO ONE OF THOSE MINUTE
AND LABORIOUS INVESTIGATIONS WHICH FORM THE SOLID BASIS ON WHICH HIS
BRILLIANT EDIFICES OF DEDUCTION WERE REARED
SEATED IN A CORNER LIKE AN
INTERESTED STUDENT WHO OBSERVES THE DEMONSTRATION OF HIS PROFESSOR
I FOLLOWED EVERY STEP OF THAT REMARKABLE RESEARCH
THE WINDOW THE
CURTAINS THE CARPET THE CHAIR THE ROPE EACH IN TURN WAS MINUTELY
EXAMINED AND DULY PONDERED
THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE BARONET HAD
BEEN REMOVED AND ALL ELSE REMAINED AS WE HAD SEEN IT IN THE MORNING
FINALLY TO MY ASTONISHMENT HOLMES CLIMBED UP ON TO THE MASSIVE
MANTELPIECE
FAR ABOVE HIS HEAD HUNG THE FEW INCHES OF RED CORD WHICH
WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE WIRE
FOR A LONG TIME HE GAZED UPWARD AT IT
AND THEN IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET NEARER TO IT HE RESTED HIS KNEE UPON A
WOODEN BRACKET ON THE WALL
THIS BROUGHT HIS HAND WITHIN A FEW INCHES OF
THE BROKEN END OF THE ROPE BUT IT WAS NOT THIS SO MUCH AS THE BRACKET
ITSELF WHICH SEEMED TO ENGAGE HIS ATTENTION
FINALLY HE SPRANG DOWN
WITH AN EJACULATION OF SATISFACTION
IT'S ALL RIGHT WATSON SAID HE
WE HAVE GOT OUR CASE ONE OF THE
MOST REMARKABLE IN OUR COLLECTION
BUT DEAR ME HOW SLOW WITTED I HAVE
BEEN AND HOW NEARLY I HAVE COMMITTED THE BLUNDER OF MY LIFETIME NOW I
THINK THAT WITH A FEW MISSING LINKS MY CHAIN IS ALMOST COMPLETE
YOU HAVE GOT YOUR MEN
MAN WATSON MAN
ONLY ONE BUT A VERY FORMIDABLE PERSON
STRONG AS A
LION WITNESS THE BLOW THAT BENT THAT POKER SIX FOOT THREE IN HEIGHT
ACTIVE AS A SQUIRREL DEXTEROUS WITH HIS FINGERS FINALLY REMARKABLY
QUICK WITTED FOR THIS WHOLE INGENIOUS STORY IS OF HIS CONCOCTION
YES
WATSON WE HAVE COME UPON THE HANDIWORK OF A VERY REMARKABLE INDIVIDUAL
AND YET IN THAT BELL ROPE HE HAS GIVEN US A CLUE WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE
LEFT US A DOUBT
WHERE WAS THE CLUE
WELL IF YOU WERE TO PULL DOWN A BELL ROPE WATSON WHERE WOULD YOU
EXPECT IT TO BREAK SURELY AT THE SPOT WHERE IT IS ATTACHED TO THE WIRE
WHY SHOULD IT BREAK THREE INCHES FROM THE TOP AS THIS ONE HAS DONE
BECAUSE IT IS FRAYED THERE
EXACTLY
THIS END WHICH WE CAN EXAMINE IS FRAYED
HE WAS CUNNING
ENOUGH TO DO THAT WITH HIS KNIFE
BUT THE OTHER END IS NOT FRAYED
YOU
COULD NOT OBSERVE THAT FROM HERE BUT IF YOU WERE ON THE MANTELPIECE YOU
WOULD SEE THAT IT IS CUT CLEAN OFF WITHOUT ANY MARK OF FRAYING WHATEVER
YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT WHAT OCCURRED
THE MAN NEEDED THE ROPE
HE WOULD NOT
TEAR IT DOWN FOR FEAR OF GIVING THE ALARM BY RINGING THE BELL
WHAT DID
HE DO HE SPRANG UP ON THE MANTELPIECE COULD NOT QUITE REACH IT PUT
HIS KNEE ON THE BRACKET YOU WILL SEE THE IMPRESSION IN THE DUST AND SO
GOT HIS KNIFE TO BEAR UPON THE CORD
I COULD NOT REACH THE PLACE BY AT
LEAST THREE INCHES FROM WHICH I INFER THAT HE IS AT LEAST THREE INCHES
A BIGGER MAN THAN I
LOOK AT THAT MARK UPON THE SEAT OF THE OAKEN CHAIR
WHAT IS IT
BLOOD
UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS BLOOD
THIS ALONE PUTS THE LADY'S STORY OUT OF COURT
IF SHE WERE SEATED ON THE CHAIR WHEN THE CRIME WAS DONE HOW COMES
THAT MARK NO NO SHE WAS PLACED IN THE CHAIR AFTER THE DEATH OF HER
HUSBAND
I'LL WAGER THAT THE BLACK DRESS SHOWS A CORRESPONDING MARK TO
THIS
WE HAVE NOT YET MET OUR WATERLOO WATSON BUT THIS IS OUR MARENGO
FOR IT BEGINS IN DEFEAT AND ENDS IN VICTORY
I SHOULD LIKE NOW TO HAVE
A FEW WORDS WITH THE NURSE THERESA
WE MUST BE WARY FOR A WHILE IF WE
ARE TO GET THE INFORMATION WHICH WE WANT
SHE WAS AN INTERESTING PERSON THIS STERN AUSTRALIAN NURSE TACITURN
SUSPICIOUS UNGRACIOUS IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE HOLMES'S PLEASANT
MANNER AND FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF ALL THAT SHE SAID THAWED HER INTO A
CORRESPONDING AMIABILITY
SHE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL HER HATRED FOR
HER LATE EMPLOYER
YES SIR IT IS TRUE THAT HE THREW THE DECANTER AT ME
I HEARD HIM CALL
MY MISTRESS A NAME AND I TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT DARE TO SPEAK SO IF
HER BROTHER HAD BEEN THERE
THEN IT WAS THAT HE THREW IT AT ME
HE
MIGHT HAVE THROWN A DOZEN IF HE HAD BUT LEFT MY BONNY BIRD ALONE
HE WAS
FOREVER ILL TREATING HER AND SHE TOO PROUD TO COMPLAIN
SHE WILL NOT
EVEN TELL ME ALL THAT HE HAS DONE TO HER
SHE NEVER TOLD ME OF THOSE
MARKS ON HER ARM THAT YOU SAW THIS MORNING BUT I KNOW VERY WELL THAT
THEY COME FROM A STAB WITH A HATPIN
THE SLY DEVIL GOD FORGIVE ME THAT
I SHOULD SPEAK OF HIM SO NOW THAT HE IS DEAD BUT A DEVIL HE WAS IF
EVER ONE WALKED THE EARTH
HE WAS ALL HONEY WHEN FIRST WE MET HIM ONLY
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO AND WE BOTH FEEL AS IF IT WERE EIGHTEEN YEARS
SHE
HAD ONLY JUST ARRIVED IN LONDON
YES IT WAS HER FIRST VOYAGE SHE HAD
NEVER BEEN FROM HOME BEFORE
HE WON HER WITH HIS TITLE AND HIS MONEY
AND HIS FALSE LONDON WAYS
IF SHE MADE A MISTAKE SHE HAS PAID FOR IT
IF EVER A WOMAN DID
WHAT MONTH DID WE MEET HIM WELL I TELL YOU IT WAS
JUST AFTER WE ARRIVED
WE ARRIVED IN JUNE AND IT WAS JULY
THEY WERE
MARRIED IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR
YES SHE IS DOWN IN THE MORNING ROOM
AGAIN AND I HAVE NO DOUBT SHE WILL SEE YOU BUT YOU MUST NOT ASK TOO
MUCH OF HER FOR SHE HAS GONE THROUGH ALL THAT FLESH AND BLOOD WILL
STAND
LADY BRACKENSTALL WAS RECLINING ON THE SAME COUCH BUT LOOKED BRIGHTER
THAN BEFORE
THE MAID HAD ENTERED WITH US AND BEGAN ONCE MORE TO FOMENT
THE BRUISE UPON HER MISTRESS'S BROW
I HOPE SAID THE LADY THAT YOU HAVE NOT COME TO CROSS EXAMINE ME
AGAIN
NO HOLMES ANSWERED IN HIS GENTLEST VOICE I WILL NOT CAUSE YOU ANY
UNNECESSARY TROUBLE LADY BRACKENSTALL AND MY WHOLE DESIRE IS TO MAKE
THINGS EASY FOR YOU FOR I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE A MUCH TRIED WOMAN
IF YOU WILL TREAT ME AS A FRIEND AND TRUST ME YOU MAY FIND THAT I WILL
JUSTIFY YOUR TRUST
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH
MR
HOLMES
NO NO LADY BRACKENSTALL IT IS NO USE
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF ANY
LITTLE REPUTATION WHICH I POSSESS
I WILL STAKE IT ALL ON THE FACT THAT
YOUR STORY IS AN ABSOLUTE FABRICATION
MISTRESS AND MAID WERE BOTH STARING AT HOLMES WITH PALE FACES AND
FRIGHTENED EYES
YOU ARE AN IMPUDENT FELLOW CRIED THERESA
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT MY
MISTRESS HAS TOLD A LIE
HOLMES ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
HAVE YOU NOTHING TO TELL ME
I HAVE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
THINK ONCE MORE LADY BRACKENSTALL
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO BE
FRANK
FOR AN INSTANT THERE WAS HESITATION IN HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
THEN SOME NEW
STRONG THOUGHT CAUSED IT TO SET LIKE A MASK
I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL I KNOW
HOLMES TOOK HIS HAT AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I AM SORRY HE SAID
AND WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD WE LEFT THE ROOM AND THE HOUSE
THERE WAS A
POND IN THE PARK AND TO THIS MY FRIEND LED THE WAY
IT WAS FROZEN
OVER BUT A SINGLE HOLE WAS LEFT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF A SOLITARY
SWAN
HOLMES GAZED AT IT AND THEN PASSED ON TO THE LODGE GATE
THERE
HE SCRIBBLED A SHORT NOTE FOR STANLEY HOPKINS AND LEFT IT WITH THE
LODGE KEEPER
IT MAY BE A HIT OR IT MAY BE A MISS BUT WE ARE BOUND TO DO SOMETHING
FOR FRIEND HOPKINS JUST TO JUSTIFY THIS SECOND VISIT SAID HE
I WILL
NOT QUITE TAKE HIM INTO MY CONFIDENCE YET
I THINK OUR NEXT SCENE OF
OPERATIONS MUST BE THE SHIPPING OFFICE OF THE ADELAIDE SOUTHAMPTON LINE
WHICH STANDS AT THE END OF PALL MALL IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
THERE IS A
SECOND LINE OF STEAMERS WHICH CONNECT SOUTH AUSTRALIA WITH ENGLAND BUT
WE WILL DRAW THE LARGER COVER FIRST
HOLMES'S CARD SENT IN TO THE MANAGER ENSURED INSTANT ATTENTION AND HE
WAS NOT LONG IN ACQUIRING ALL THE INFORMATION HE NEEDED
IN JUNE OF
'95 ONLY ONE OF THEIR LINE HAD REACHED A HOME PORT
IT WAS THE ROCK
OF GIBRALTAR THEIR LARGEST AND BEST BOAT
A REFERENCE TO THE PASSENGER
LIST SHOWED THAT MISS FRASER OF ADELAIDE WITH HER MAID HAD MADE THE
VOYAGE IN HER
THE BOAT WAS NOW SOMEWHERE SOUTH OF THE SUEZ CANAL ON
HER WAY TO AUSTRALIA
HER OFFICERS WERE THE SAME AS IN '95 WITH ONE
EXCEPTION
THE FIRST OFFICER MR
JACK CROCKER HAD BEEN MADE A CAPTAIN
AND WAS TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEIR NEW SHIP THE BASS ROCK SAILING IN TWO
DAYS' TIME FROM SOUTHAMPTON
HE LIVED AT SYDENHAM BUT HE WAS LIKELY TO
BE IN THAT MORNING FOR INSTRUCTIONS IF WE CARED TO WAIT FOR HIM
NO MR
HOLMES HAD NO DESIRE TO SEE HIM BUT WOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT HIS RECORD AND CHARACTER
HIS RECORD WAS MAGNIFICENT
THERE WAS NOT AN OFFICER IN THE FLEET TO
TOUCH HIM
AS TO HIS CHARACTER HE WAS RELIABLE ON DUTY BUT A WILD
DESPERATE FELLOW OFF THE DECK OF HIS SHIP HOT HEADED EXCITABLE BUT
LOYAL HONEST AND KIND HEARTED
THAT WAS THE PITH OF THE INFORMATION
WITH WHICH HOLMES LEFT THE OFFICE OF THE ADELAIDE SOUTHAMPTON COMPANY
THENCE HE DROVE TO SCOTLAND YARD BUT INSTEAD OF ENTERING HE SAT IN
HIS CAB WITH HIS BROWS DRAWN DOWN LOST IN PROFOUND THOUGHT
FINALLY HE
DROVE ROUND TO THE CHARING CROSS TELEGRAPH OFFICE SENT OFF A MESSAGE
AND THEN AT LAST WE MADE FOR BAKER STREET ONCE MORE
NO I COULDN'T DO IT WATSON SAID HE AS WE REENTERED OUR ROOM
ONCE
THAT WARRANT WAS MADE OUT NOTHING ON EARTH WOULD SAVE HIM
ONCE
OR TWICE IN MY CAREER I FEEL THAT I HAVE DONE MORE REAL HARM BY MY
DISCOVERY OF THE CRIMINAL THAN EVER HE HAD DONE BY HIS CRIME
I HAVE
LEARNED CAUTION NOW AND I HAD RATHER PLAY TRICKS WITH THE LAW OF
ENGLAND THAN WITH MY OWN CONSCIENCE
LET US KNOW A LITTLE MORE BEFORE WE
ACT
BEFORE EVENING WE HAD A VISIT FROM INSPECTOR STANLEY HOPKINS
THINGS
WERE NOT GOING VERY WELL WITH HIM
I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE A WIZARD MR
HOLMES
I REALLY DO SOMETIMES
THINK THAT YOU HAVE POWERS THAT ARE NOT HUMAN
NOW HOW ON EARTH COULD
YOU KNOW THAT THE STOLEN SILVER WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT POND
I DIDN'T KNOW IT
BUT YOU TOLD ME TO EXAMINE IT
YOU GOT IT THEN
YES I GOT IT
I AM VERY GLAD IF I HAVE HELPED YOU
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HELPED ME
YOU HAVE MADE THE AFFAIR FAR MORE DIFFICULT
WHAT SORT OF BURGLARS ARE THEY WHO STEAL SILVER AND THEN THROW IT INTO
THE NEAREST POND
IT WAS CERTAINLY RATHER ECCENTRIC BEHAVIOUR
I WAS MERELY GOING ON
THE IDEA THAT IF THE SILVER HAD BEEN TAKEN BY PERSONS WHO DID NOT
WANT IT WHO MERELY TOOK IT FOR A BLIND AS IT WERE THEN THEY WOULD
NATURALLY BE ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF IT
BUT WHY SHOULD SUCH AN IDEA CROSS YOUR MIND
WELL I THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE
WHEN THEY CAME OUT THROUGH THE FRENCH
WINDOW THERE WAS THE POND WITH ONE TEMPTING LITTLE HOLE IN THE ICE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEIR NOSES
COULD THERE BE A BETTER HIDING PLACE
AH A HIDING PLACE THAT IS BETTER CRIED STANLEY HOPKINS
YES YES
I SEE IT ALL NOW IT WAS EARLY THERE WERE FOLK UPON THE ROADS THEY
WERE AFRAID OF BEING SEEN WITH THE SILVER SO THEY SANK IT IN THE POND
INTENDING TO RETURN FOR IT WHEN THE COAST WAS CLEAR
EXCELLENT MR
HOLMES THAT IS BETTER THAN YOUR IDEA OF A BLIND
QUITE SO YOU HAVE GOT AN ADMIRABLE THEORY
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT MY
OWN IDEAS WERE QUITE WILD BUT YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THEY HAVE ENDED IN
DISCOVERING THE SILVER
YES SIR YES
IT WAS ALL YOUR DOING
BUT I HAVE HAD A BAD SETBACK
A SETBACK
YES MR
HOLMES
THE RANDALL GANG WERE ARRESTED IN NEW YORK THIS
MORNING
DEAR ME HOPKINS THAT IS CERTAINLY RATHER AGAINST YOUR THEORY THAT
THEY COMMITTED A MURDER IN KENT LAST NIGHT
IT IS FATAL MR
HOLMES ABSOLUTELY FATAL
STILL THERE ARE OTHER GANGS
OF THREE BESIDES THE RANDALLS OR IT MAY BE SOME NEW GANG OF WHICH THE
POLICE HAVE NEVER HEARD
QUITE SO IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE
WHAT ARE YOU OFF
YES MR
HOLMES THERE IS NO REST FOR ME UNTIL I HAVE GOT TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE BUSINESS
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NO HINT TO GIVE ME
I HAVE GIVEN YOU ONE
WHICH
WELL I SUGGESTED A BLIND
BUT WHY MR
HOLMES WHY
AH THAT'S THE QUESTION OF COURSE
BUT I COMMEND THE IDEA TO YOUR
MIND
YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN IT
YOU WON'T
STOP FOR DINNER WELL GOOD BYE AND LET US KNOW HOW YOU GET ON
DINNER WAS OVER AND THE TABLE CLEARED BEFORE HOLMES ALLUDED TO THE
MATTER AGAIN
HE HAD LIT HIS PIPE AND HELD HIS SLIPPERED FEET TO THE
CHEERFUL BLAZE OF THE FIRE
SUDDENLY HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
I EXPECT DEVELOPMENTS WATSON
WHEN
NOW WITHIN A FEW MINUTES
I DARE SAY YOU THOUGHT I ACTED RATHER BADLY
TO STANLEY HOPKINS JUST NOW
I TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT
A VERY SENSIBLE REPLY WATSON
YOU MUST LOOK AT IT THIS WAY WHAT
I KNOW IS UNOFFICIAL WHAT HE KNOWS IS OFFICIAL
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO
PRIVATE JUDGMENT BUT HE HAS NONE
HE MUST DISCLOSE ALL OR HE IS A
TRAITOR TO HIS SERVICE
IN A DOUBTFUL CASE I WOULD NOT PUT HIM IN SO
PAINFUL A POSITION AND SO I RESERVE MY INFORMATION UNTIL MY OWN MIND IS
CLEAR UPON THE MATTER
BUT WHEN WILL THAT BE
THE TIME HAS COME
YOU WILL NOW BE PRESENT AT THE LAST SCENE OF A
REMARKABLE LITTLE DRAMA
THERE WAS A SOUND UPON THE STAIRS AND OUR DOOR WAS OPENED TO ADMIT AS
FINE A SPECIMEN OF MANHOOD AS EVER PASSED THROUGH IT
HE WAS A VERY
TALL YOUNG MAN GOLDEN MOUSTACHED BLUE EYED WITH A SKIN WHICH HAD BEEN
BURNED BY TROPICAL SUNS AND A SPRINGY STEP WHICH SHOWED THAT THE HUGE
FRAME WAS AS ACTIVE AS IT WAS STRONG
HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND
THEN HE STOOD WITH CLENCHED HANDS AND HEAVING BREAST CHOKING DOWN SOME
OVERMASTERING EMOTION
SIT DOWN CAPTAIN CROCKER
YOU GOT MY TELEGRAM
OUR VISITOR SANK INTO AN ARMCHAIR AND LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US
WITH QUESTIONING EYES
I GOT YOUR TELEGRAM AND I CAME AT THE HOUR YOU SAID
I HEARD THAT YOU
HAD BEEN DOWN TO THE OFFICE
THERE WAS NO GETTING AWAY FROM YOU
LET'S
HEAR THE WORST
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH ME ARREST ME SPEAK OUT
MAN YOU CAN'T SIT THERE AND PLAY WITH ME LIKE A CAT WITH A MOUSE
GIVE HIM A CIGAR SAID HOLMES
BITE ON THAT CAPTAIN CROCKER AND
DON'T LET YOUR NERVES RUN AWAY WITH YOU
I SHOULD NOT SIT HERE SMOKING
WITH YOU IF I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE A COMMON CRIMINAL YOU MAY BE SURE
OF THAT
BE FRANK WITH ME AND WE MAY DO SOME GOOD
PLAY TRICKS WITH ME
AND I'LL CRUSH YOU
WHAT DO YOU WISH ME TO DO
TO GIVE ME A TRUE ACCOUNT OF ALL THAT HAPPENED AT THE ABBEY GRANGE LAST
NIGHT A TRUE ACCOUNT MIND YOU WITH NOTHING ADDED AND NOTHING TAKEN
OFF
I KNOW SO MUCH ALREADY THAT IF YOU GO ONE INCH OFF THE STRAIGHT
I'LL BLOW THIS POLICE WHISTLE FROM MY WINDOW AND THE AFFAIR GOES OUT OF
MY HANDS FOREVER
THE SAILOR THOUGHT FOR A LITTLE
THEN HE STRUCK HIS LEG WITH HIS GREAT
SUNBURNED HAND
I'LL CHANCE IT HE CRIED
I BELIEVE YOU ARE A MAN OF YOUR WORD AND
A WHITE MAN AND I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
BUT ONE THING I WILL SAY
FIRST
SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I REGRET NOTHING AND I FEAR NOTHING
AND I WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN AND BE PROUD OF THE JOB
DAMN THE BEAST IF
HE HAD AS MANY LIVES AS A CAT HE WOULD OWE THEM ALL TO ME BUT IT'S
THE LADY MARY MARY FRASER FOR NEVER WILL I CALL HER BY THAT ACCURSED
NAME
WHEN I THINK OF GETTING HER INTO TROUBLE I WHO WOULD GIVE MY LIFE
JUST TO BRING ONE SMILE TO HER DEAR FACE IT'S THAT THAT TURNS MY SOUL
INTO WATER
AND YET AND YET WHAT LESS COULD I DO I'LL TELL YOU MY
STORY GENTLEMEN AND THEN I'LL ASK YOU AS MAN TO MAN WHAT LESS COULD
I DO
I MUST GO BACK A BIT
YOU SEEM TO KNOW EVERYTHING SO I EXPECT THAT YOU
KNOW THAT I MET HER WHEN SHE WAS A PASSENGER AND I WAS FIRST OFFICER OF
THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR
FROM THE FIRST DAY I MET HER SHE WAS THE ONLY
WOMAN TO ME
EVERY DAY OF THAT VOYAGE I LOVED HER MORE AND MANY A TIME
SINCE HAVE I KNEELED DOWN IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT WATCH AND KISSED
THE DECK OF THAT SHIP BECAUSE I KNEW HER DEAR FEET HAD TROD IT
SHE WAS
NEVER ENGAGED TO ME
SHE TREATED ME AS FAIRLY AS EVER A WOMAN TREATED
A MAN
I HAVE NO COMPLAINT TO MAKE
IT WAS ALL LOVE ON MY SIDE AND ALL
GOOD COMRADESHIP AND FRIENDSHIP ON HERS
WHEN WE PARTED SHE WAS A FREE
WOMAN BUT I COULD NEVER AGAIN BE A FREE MAN
NEXT TIME I CAME BACK FROM SEA I HEARD OF HER MARRIAGE
WELL WHY
SHOULDN'T SHE MARRY WHOM SHE LIKED TITLE AND MONEY WHO COULD CARRY
THEM BETTER THAN SHE SHE WAS BORN FOR ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL AND DAINTY
I DIDN'T GRIEVE OVER HER MARRIAGE
I WAS NOT SUCH A SELFISH HOUND AS
THAT
I JUST REJOICED THAT GOOD LUCK HAD COME HER WAY AND THAT SHE HAD
NOT THROWN HERSELF AWAY ON A PENNILESS SAILOR
THAT'S HOW I LOVED MARY
FRASER
WELL I NEVER THOUGHT TO SEE HER AGAIN BUT LAST VOYAGE I WAS PROMOTED
AND THE NEW BOAT WAS NOT YET LAUNCHED SO I HAD TO WAIT FOR A COUPLE OF
MONTHS WITH MY PEOPLE AT SYDENHAM
ONE DAY OUT IN A COUNTRY LANE I MET
THERESA WRIGHT HER OLD MAID
SHE TOLD ME ALL ABOUT HER ABOUT HIM
ABOUT EVERYTHING
I TELL YOU GENTLEMEN IT NEARLY DROVE ME MAD
THIS
DRUNKEN HOUND THAT HE SHOULD DARE TO RAISE HIS HAND TO HER WHOSE
BOOTS HE WAS NOT WORTHY TO LICK I MET THERESA AGAIN
THEN I MET MARY
HERSELF AND MET HER AGAIN
THEN SHE WOULD MEET ME NO MORE
BUT THE
OTHER DAY I HAD A NOTICE THAT I WAS TO START ON MY VOYAGE WITHIN A WEEK
AND I DETERMINED THAT I WOULD SEE HER ONCE BEFORE I LEFT
THERESA WAS
ALWAYS MY FRIEND FOR SHE LOVED MARY AND HATED THIS VILLAIN ALMOST AS
MUCH AS I DID
FROM HER I LEARNED THE WAYS OF THE HOUSE
MARY USED TO
SIT UP READING IN HER OWN LITTLE ROOM DOWNSTAIRS
I CREPT ROUND THERE
LAST NIGHT AND SCRATCHED AT THE WINDOW
AT FIRST SHE WOULD NOT OPEN TO
ME BUT IN HER HEART I KNOW THAT NOW SHE LOVES ME AND SHE COULD NOT
LEAVE ME IN THE FROSTY NIGHT
SHE WHISPERED TO ME TO COME ROUND TO THE
BIG FRONT WINDOW AND I FOUND IT OPEN BEFORE ME SO AS TO LET ME INTO
THE DINING ROOM
AGAIN I HEARD FROM HER OWN LIPS THINGS THAT MADE MY
BLOOD BOIL AND AGAIN I CURSED THIS BRUTE WHO MISHANDLED THE WOMAN I
LOVED
WELL GENTLEMEN I WAS STANDING WITH HER JUST INSIDE THE WINDOW
IN ALL INNOCENCE AS GOD IS MY JUDGE WHEN HE RUSHED LIKE A MADMAN INTO
THE ROOM CALLED HER THE VILEST NAME THAT A MAN COULD USE TO A WOMAN
AND WELTED HER ACROSS THE FACE WITH THE STICK HE HAD IN HIS HAND
I HAD
SPRUNG FOR THE POKER AND IT WAS A FAIR FIGHT BETWEEN US
SEE HERE
ON MY ARM WHERE HIS FIRST BLOW FELL
THEN IT WAS MY TURN AND I WENT
THROUGH HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN A ROTTEN PUMPKIN
DO YOU THINK I WAS
SORRY NOT I IT WAS HIS LIFE OR MINE BUT FAR MORE THAN THAT IT WAS
HIS LIFE OR HERS FOR HOW COULD I LEAVE HER IN THE POWER OF THIS MADMAN
THAT WAS HOW I KILLED HIM
WAS I WRONG WELL THEN WHAT WOULD EITHER OF
YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE DONE IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY POSITION
SHE HAD SCREAMED WHEN HE STRUCK HER AND THAT BROUGHT OLD THERESA DOWN
FROM THE ROOM ABOVE
THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF WINE ON THE SIDEBOARD AND I
OPENED IT AND POURED A LITTLE BETWEEN MARY'S LIPS FOR SHE WAS HALF DEAD
WITH SHOCK
THEN I TOOK A DROP MYSELF
THERESA WAS AS COOL AS ICE AND
IT WAS HER PLOT AS MUCH AS MINE
WE MUST MAKE IT APPEAR THAT BURGLARS
HAD DONE THE THING
THERESA KEPT ON REPEATING OUR STORY TO HER MISTRESS
WHILE I SWARMED UP AND CUT THE ROPE OF THE BELL
THEN I LASHED HER IN
HER CHAIR AND FRAYED OUT THE END OF THE ROPE TO MAKE IT LOOK NATURAL
ELSE THEY WOULD WONDER HOW IN THE WORLD A BURGLAR COULD HAVE GOT UP
THERE TO CUT IT
THEN I GATHERED UP A FEW PLATES AND POTS OF SILVER TO
CARRY OUT THE IDEA OF THE ROBBERY AND THERE I LEFT THEM WITH ORDERS
TO GIVE THE ALARM WHEN I HAD A QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S START
I DROPPED THE
SILVER INTO THE POND AND MADE OFF FOR SYDENHAM FEELING THAT FOR ONCE
IN MY LIFE I HAD DONE A REAL GOOD NIGHT'S WORK
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH AND
THE WHOLE TRUTH MR
HOLMES IF IT COSTS ME MY NECK
HOLMES SMOKED FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE
THEN HE CROSSED THE ROOM AND
SHOOK OUR VISITOR BY THE HAND
THAT'S WHAT I THINK SAID HE
I KNOW THAT EVERY WORD IS TRUE FOR YOU
HAVE HARDLY SAID A WORD WHICH I DID NOT KNOW
NO ONE BUT AN ACROBAT OR A
SAILOR COULD HAVE GOT UP TO THAT BELL ROPE FROM THE BRACKET AND NO ONE
BUT A SAILOR COULD HAVE MADE THE KNOTS WITH WHICH THE CORD WAS FASTENED
TO THE CHAIR
ONLY ONCE HAD THIS LADY BEEN BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH
SAILORS AND THAT WAS ON HER VOYAGE AND IT WAS SOMEONE OF HER OWN CLASS
OF LIFE SINCE SHE WAS TRYING HARD TO SHIELD HIM AND SO SHOWING THAT
SHE LOVED HIM
YOU SEE HOW EASY IT WAS FOR ME TO LAY MY HANDS UPON YOU
WHEN ONCE I HAD STARTED UPON THE RIGHT TRAIL
I THOUGHT THE POLICE NEVER COULD HAVE SEEN THROUGH OUR DODGE
AND THE POLICE HAVEN'T NOR WILL THEY TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF
NOW
LOOK HERE CAPTAIN CROCKER THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER THOUGH I AM
WILLING TO ADMIT THAT YOU ACTED UNDER THE MOST EXTREME PROVOCATION TO
WHICH ANY MAN COULD BE SUBJECTED
I AM NOT SURE THAT IN DEFENCE OF YOUR
OWN LIFE YOUR ACTION WILL NOT BE PRONOUNCED LEGITIMATE
HOWEVER THAT IS
FOR A BRITISH JURY TO DECIDE
MEANWHILE I HAVE SO MUCH SYMPATHY FOR YOU
THAT IF YOU CHOOSE TO DISAPPEAR IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS I WILL
PROMISE YOU THAT NO ONE WILL HINDER YOU
AND THEN IT WILL ALL COME OUT
CERTAINLY IT WILL COME OUT
THE SAILOR FLUSHED WITH ANGER
WHAT SORT OF PROPOSAL IS THAT TO MAKE A MAN I KNOW ENOUGH OF LAW TO
UNDERSTAND THAT MARY WOULD BE HELD AS ACCOMPLICE
DO YOU THINK I WOULD
LEAVE HER ALONE TO FACE THE MUSIC WHILE I SLUNK AWAY NO SIR LET THEM
DO THEIR WORST UPON ME BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE MR
HOLMES FIND SOME WAY
OF KEEPING MY POOR MARY OUT OF THE COURTS
HOLMES FOR A SECOND TIME HELD OUT HIS HAND TO THE SAILOR
I WAS ONLY TESTING YOU AND YOU RING TRUE EVERY TIME
WELL IT IS A
GREAT RESPONSIBILITY THAT I TAKE UPON MYSELF BUT I HAVE GIVEN HOPKINS
AN EXCELLENT HINT AND IF HE CAN'T AVAIL HIMSELF OF IT I CAN DO NO MORE
SEE HERE CAPTAIN CROCKER WE'LL DO THIS IN DUE FORM OF LAW
YOU ARE THE
PRISONER
WATSON YOU ARE A BRITISH JURY AND I NEVER MET A MAN WHO WAS
MORE EMINENTLY FITTED TO REPRESENT ONE
I AM THE JUDGE
NOW GENTLEMAN
OF THE JURY YOU HAVE HEARD THE EVIDENCE
DO YOU FIND THE PRISONER
GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY
NOT GUILTY MY LORD SAID I
VOX POPULI VOX DEI
YOU ARE ACQUITTED CAPTAIN CROCKER
SO LONG AS THE
LAW DOES NOT FIND SOME OTHER VICTIM YOU ARE SAFE FROM ME
COME BACK
TO THIS LADY IN A YEAR AND MAY HER FUTURE AND YOURS JUSTIFY US IN THE
JUDGMENT WHICH WE HAVE PRONOUNCED THIS NIGHT
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN
I HAD INTENDED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE TO BE THE LAST OF
THOSE EXPLOITS OF MY FRIEND MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES WHICH I SHOULD EVER
COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC
THIS RESOLUTION OF MINE WAS NOT DUE TO ANY
LACK OF MATERIAL SINCE I HAVE NOTES OF MANY HUNDREDS OF CASES TO WHICH
I HAVE NEVER ALLUDED NOR WAS IT CAUSED BY ANY WANING INTEREST ON THE
PART OF MY READERS IN THE SINGULAR PERSONALITY AND UNIQUE METHODS OF
THIS REMARKABLE MAN
THE REAL REASON LAY IN THE RELUCTANCE WHICH MR
HOLMES HAS SHOWN TO THE CONTINUED PUBLICATION OF HIS EXPERIENCES
SO LONG AS HE WAS IN ACTUAL PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE THE RECORDS OF
HIS SUCCESSES WERE OF SOME PRACTICAL VALUE TO HIM BUT SINCE HE
HAS DEFINITELY RETIRED FROM LONDON AND BETAKEN HIMSELF TO STUDY AND
BEE FARMING ON THE SUSSEX DOWNS NOTORIETY HAS BECOME HATEFUL TO HIM
AND HE HAS PEREMPTORILY REQUESTED THAT HIS WISHES IN THIS MATTER SHOULD
BE STRICTLY OBSERVED
IT WAS ONLY UPON MY REPRESENTING TO HIM THAT I
HAD GIVEN A PROMISE THAT THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN SHOULD BE
PUBLISHED WHEN THE TIMES WERE RIPE AND POINTING OUT TO HIM THAT IT IS
ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT THIS LONG SERIES OF EPISODES SHOULD CULMINATE IN
THE MOST IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL CASE WHICH HE HAS EVER BEEN CALLED
UPON TO HANDLE THAT I AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING HIS CONSENT THAT A
CAREFULLY GUARDED ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT SHOULD AT LAST BE LAID BEFORE
THE PUBLIC
IF IN TELLING THE STORY I SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT VAGUE IN
CERTAIN DETAILS THE PUBLIC WILL READILY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN
EXCELLENT REASON FOR MY RETICENCE
IT WAS THEN IN A YEAR AND EVEN IN A DECADE THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS
THAT UPON ONE TUESDAY MORNING IN AUTUMN WE FOUND TWO VISITORS OF
EUROPEAN FAME WITHIN THE WALLS OF OUR HUMBLE ROOM IN BAKER STREET
THE
ONE AUSTERE HIGH NOSED EAGLE EYED AND DOMINANT WAS NONE OTHER THAN
THE ILLUSTRIOUS LORD BELLINGER TWICE PREMIER OF BRITAIN
THE OTHER
DARK CLEAR CUT AND ELEGANT HARDLY YET OF MIDDLE AGE AND ENDOWED WITH
EVERY BEAUTY OF BODY AND OF MIND WAS THE RIGHT HONOURABLE TRELAWNEY
HOPE SECRETARY FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AND THE MOST RISING STATESMAN IN
THE COUNTRY
THEY SAT SIDE BY SIDE UPON OUR PAPER LITTERED SETTEE
AND IT WAS EASY TO SEE FROM THEIR WORN AND ANXIOUS FACES THAT IT WAS
BUSINESS OF THE MOST PRESSING IMPORTANCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT THEM
THE
PREMIER'S THIN BLUE VEINED HANDS WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY OVER THE IVORY
HEAD OF HIS UMBRELLA AND HIS GAUNT ASCETIC FACE LOOKED GLOOMILY FROM
HOLMES TO ME
THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY PULLED NERVOUSLY AT HIS MOUSTACHE
AND FIDGETED WITH THE SEALS OF HIS WATCH CHAIN
WHEN I DISCOVERED MY LOSS MR
HOLMES WHICH WAS AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS
MORNING I AT ONCE INFORMED THE PRIME MINISTER
IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION
THAT WE HAVE BOTH COME TO YOU
HAVE YOU INFORMED THE POLICE
NO SIR SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH THE QUICK DECISIVE MANNER FOR
WHICH HE WAS FAMOUS
WE HAVE NOT DONE SO NOR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE
SHOULD DO SO
TO INFORM THE POLICE MUST IN THE LONG RUN MEAN TO INFORM
THE PUBLIC
THIS IS WHAT WE PARTICULARLY DESIRE TO AVOID
AND WHY SIR
BECAUSE THE DOCUMENT IN QUESTION IS OF SUCH IMMENSE IMPORTANCE THAT
ITS PUBLICATION MIGHT VERY EASILY I MIGHT ALMOST SAY PROBABLY LEAD TO
EUROPEAN COMPLICATIONS OF THE UTMOST MOMENT
IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY
THAT PEACE OR WAR MAY HANG UPON THE ISSUE
UNLESS ITS RECOVERY CAN BE
ATTENDED WITH THE UTMOST SECRECY THEN IT MAY AS WELL NOT BE RECOVERED
AT ALL FOR ALL THAT IS AIMED AT BY THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN IT IS THAT ITS
CONTENTS SHOULD BE GENERALLY KNOWN
I UNDERSTAND
NOW MR
TRELAWNEY HOPE I SHOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED IF
YOU WOULD TELL ME EXACTLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THIS DOCUMENT
DISAPPEARED
THAT CAN BE DONE IN A VERY FEW WORDS MR
HOLMES
THE LETTER FOR IT
WAS A LETTER FROM A FOREIGN POTENTATE WAS RECEIVED SIX DAYS AGO
IT WAS
OF SUCH IMPORTANCE THAT I HAVE NEVER LEFT IT IN MY SAFE BUT HAVE TAKEN
IT ACROSS EACH EVENING TO MY HOUSE IN WHITEHALL TERRACE AND KEPT IT IN
MY BEDROOM IN A LOCKED DESPATCH BOX
IT WAS THERE LAST NIGHT
OF THAT
I AM CERTAIN
I ACTUALLY OPENED THE BOX WHILE I WAS DRESSING FOR DINNER
AND SAW THE DOCUMENT INSIDE
THIS MORNING IT WAS GONE
THE DESPATCH BOX
HAD STOOD BESIDE THE GLASS UPON MY DRESSING TABLE ALL NIGHT
I AM A
LIGHT SLEEPER AND SO IS MY WIFE
WE ARE BOTH PREPARED TO SWEAR THAT NO
ONE COULD HAVE ENTERED THE ROOM DURING THE NIGHT
AND YET I REPEAT THAT
THE PAPER IS GONE
WHAT TIME DID YOU DINE
HALF PAST SEVEN
HOW LONG WAS IT BEFORE YOU WENT TO BED
MY WIFE HAD GONE TO THE THEATRE
I WAITED UP FOR HER
IT WAS HALF PAST
ELEVEN BEFORE WE WENT TO OUR ROOM
THEN FOR FOUR HOURS THE DESPATCH BOX HAD LAIN UNGUARDED
NO ONE IS EVER PERMITTED TO ENTER THAT ROOM SAVE THE HOUSE MAID IN THE
MORNING AND MY VALET OR MY WIFE'S MAID DURING THE REST OF THE DAY
THEY ARE BOTH TRUSTY SERVANTS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR SOME TIME
BESIDES NEITHER OF THEM COULD POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN THAT THERE WAS
ANYTHING MORE VALUABLE THAN THE ORDINARY DEPARTMENTAL PAPERS IN MY
DESPATCH BOX
WHO DID KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THAT LETTER
NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
SURELY YOUR WIFE KNEW
NO SIR
I HAD SAID NOTHING TO MY WIFE UNTIL I MISSED THE PAPER THIS
MORNING
THE PREMIER NODDED APPROVINGLY
I HAVE LONG KNOWN SIR HOW HIGH IS YOUR SENSE OF PUBLIC DUTY SAID
HE
I AM CONVINCED THAT IN THE CASE OF A SECRET OF THIS IMPORTANCE IT
WOULD RISE SUPERIOR TO THE MOST INTIMATE DOMESTIC TIES
THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY BOWED
YOU DO ME NO MORE THAN JUSTICE SIR
UNTIL THIS MORNING I HAVE NEVER
BREATHED ONE WORD TO MY WIFE UPON THIS MATTER
COULD SHE HAVE GUESSED
NO MR
HOLMES SHE COULD NOT HAVE GUESSED NOR COULD ANYONE HAVE
GUESSED
HAVE YOU LOST ANY DOCUMENTS BEFORE
NO SIR
WHO IS THERE IN ENGLAND WHO DID KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THIS LETTER
EACH MEMBER OF THE CABINET WAS INFORMED OF IT YESTERDAY BUT THE PLEDGE
OF SECRECY WHICH ATTENDS EVERY CABINET MEETING WAS INCREASED BY THE
SOLEMN WARNING WHICH WAS GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER
GOOD HEAVENS
TO THINK THAT WITHIN A FEW HOURS I SHOULD MYSELF HAVE LOST IT HIS
HANDSOME FACE WAS DISTORTED WITH A SPASM OF DESPAIR AND HIS HANDS
TORE AT HIS HAIR
FOR A MOMENT WE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE NATURAL MAN
IMPULSIVE ARDENT KEENLY SENSITIVE
THE NEXT THE ARISTOCRATIC MASK WAS
REPLACED AND THE GENTLE VOICE HAD RETURNED
BESIDES THE MEMBERS OF
THE CABINET THERE ARE TWO OR POSSIBLY THREE DEPARTMENTAL OFFICIALS WHO
KNOW OF THE LETTER
NO ONE ELSE IN ENGLAND MR
HOLMES I ASSURE YOU
BUT ABROAD
I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE ABROAD HAS SEEN IT SAVE THE MAN WHO WROTE IT
I
AM WELL CONVINCED THAT HIS MINISTERS THAT THE USUAL OFFICIAL CHANNELS
HAVE NOT BEEN EMPLOYED
HOLMES CONSIDERED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
NOW SIR I MUST ASK YOU MORE PARTICULARLY WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS AND
WHY ITS DISAPPEARANCE SHOULD HAVE SUCH MOMENTOUS CONSEQUENCES
THE TWO STATESMEN EXCHANGED A QUICK GLANCE AND THE PREMIER'S SHAGGY
EYEBROWS GATHERED IN A FROWN
MR
HOLMES THE ENVELOPE IS A LONG THIN ONE OF PALE BLUE COLOUR
THERE
IS A SEAL OF RED WAX STAMPED WITH A CROUCHING LION
IT IS ADDRESSED IN
LARGE BOLD HANDWRITING TO
I FEAR SIR SAID HOLMES THAT INTERESTING AND INDEED ESSENTIAL AS
THESE DETAILS ARE MY INQUIRIES MUST GO MORE TO THE ROOT OF THINGS
WHAT
WAS THE LETTER
THAT IS A STATE SECRET OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND I FEAR THAT I
CANNOT TELL YOU NOR DO I SEE THAT IT IS NECESSARY
IF BY THE AID OF THE
POWERS WHICH YOU ARE SAID TO POSSESS YOU CAN FIND SUCH AN ENVELOPE AS
I DESCRIBE WITH ITS ENCLOSURE YOU WILL HAVE DESERVED WELL OF YOUR
COUNTRY AND EARNED ANY REWARD WHICH IT LIES IN OUR POWER TO BESTOW
SHERLOCK HOLMES ROSE WITH A SMILE
YOU ARE TWO OF THE MOST BUSY MEN IN THE COUNTRY SAID HE AND IN
MY OWN SMALL WAY I HAVE ALSO A GOOD MANY CALLS UPON ME
I REGRET
EXCEEDINGLY THAT I CANNOT HELP YOU IN THIS MATTER AND ANY CONTINUATION
OF THIS INTERVIEW WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME
THE PREMIER SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH THAT QUICK FIERCE GLEAM OF HIS
DEEP SET EYES BEFORE WHICH A CABINET HAS COWERED
I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED
SIR HE BEGAN BUT MASTERED HIS ANGER AND RESUMED HIS SEAT
FOR A
MINUTE OR MORE WE ALL SAT IN SILENCE
THEN THE OLD STATESMAN SHRUGGED
HIS SHOULDERS
WE MUST ACCEPT YOUR TERMS MR
HOLMES
NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT AND
IT IS UNREASONABLE FOR US TO EXPECT YOU TO ACT UNLESS WE GIVE YOU OUR
ENTIRE CONFIDENCE
I AGREE WITH YOU SAID THE YOUNGER STATESMAN
THEN I WILL TELL YOU RELYING ENTIRELY UPON YOUR HONOUR AND THAT OF
YOUR COLLEAGUE DR
WATSON
I MAY APPEAL TO YOUR PATRIOTISM ALSO FOR
I COULD NOT IMAGINE A GREATER MISFORTUNE FOR THE COUNTRY THAN THAT THIS
AFFAIR SHOULD COME OUT
YOU MAY SAFELY TRUST US
THE LETTER THEN IS FROM A CERTAIN FOREIGN POTENTATE WHO HAS BEEN
RUFFLED BY SOME RECENT COLONIAL DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS COUNTRY
IT
HAS BEEN WRITTEN HURRIEDLY AND UPON HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY ENTIRELY
INQUIRIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HIS MINISTERS KNOW NOTHING OF THE MATTER
AT THE SAME TIME IT IS COUCHED IN SO UNFORTUNATE A MANNER AND CERTAIN
PHRASES IN IT ARE OF SO PROVOCATIVE A CHARACTER THAT ITS PUBLICATION
WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LEAD TO A MOST DANGEROUS STATE OF FEELING IN THIS
COUNTRY
THERE WOULD BE SUCH A FERMENT SIR THAT I DO NOT HESITATE TO
SAY THAT WITHIN A WEEK OF THE PUBLICATION OF THAT LETTER THIS COUNTRY
WOULD BE INVOLVED IN A GREAT WAR
HOLMES WROTE A NAME UPON A SLIP OF PAPER AND HANDED IT TO THE PREMIER
EXACTLY
IT WAS HE
AND IT IS THIS LETTER THIS LETTER WHICH MAY WELL
MEAN THE EXPENDITURE OF A THOUSAND MILLIONS AND THE LIVES OF A HUNDRED
THOUSAND MEN WHICH HAS BECOME LOST IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE FASHION
HAVE YOU INFORMED THE SENDER
YES SIR A CIPHER TELEGRAM HAS BEEN DESPATCHED
PERHAPS HE DESIRES THE PUBLICATION OF THE LETTER
NO SIR WE HAVE STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE ALREADY UNDERSTANDS
THAT HE HAS ACTED IN AN INDISCREET AND HOT HEADED MANNER
IT WOULD BE A
GREATER BLOW TO HIM AND TO HIS COUNTRY THAN TO US IF THIS LETTER WERE TO
COME OUT
IF THIS IS SO WHOSE INTEREST IS IT THAT THE LETTER SHOULD COME OUT
WHY SHOULD ANYONE DESIRE TO STEAL IT OR TO PUBLISH IT
THERE MR
HOLMES YOU TAKE ME INTO REGIONS OF HIGH INTERNATIONAL
POLITICS
BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THE EUROPEAN SITUATION YOU WILL HAVE NO
DIFFICULTY IN PERCEIVING THE MOTIVE
THE WHOLE OF EUROPE IS AN ARMED
CAMP
THERE IS A DOUBLE LEAGUE WHICH MAKES A FAIR BALANCE OF MILITARY
POWER
GREAT BRITAIN HOLDS THE SCALES
IF BRITAIN WERE DRIVEN INTO
WAR WITH ONE CONFEDERACY IT WOULD ASSURE THE SUPREMACY OF THE OTHER
CONFEDERACY WHETHER THEY JOINED IN THE WAR OR NOT
DO YOU FOLLOW
VERY CLEARLY
IT IS THEN THE INTEREST OF THE ENEMIES OF THIS POTENTATE
TO SECURE AND PUBLISH THIS LETTER SO AS TO MAKE A BREACH BETWEEN HIS
COUNTRY AND OURS
YES SIR
AND TO WHOM WOULD THIS DOCUMENT BE SENT IF IT FELL INTO THE HANDS OF AN
ENEMY
TO ANY OF THE GREAT CHANCELLERIES OF EUROPE
IT IS PROBABLY SPEEDING ON
ITS WAY THITHER AT THE PRESENT INSTANT AS FAST AS STEAM CAN TAKE IT
MR
TRELAWNEY HOPE DROPPED HIS HEAD ON HIS CHEST AND GROANED ALOUD
THE
PREMIER PLACED HIS HAND KINDLY UPON HIS SHOULDER
IT IS YOUR MISFORTUNE MY DEAR FELLOW
NO ONE CAN BLAME YOU
THERE IS
NO PRECAUTION WHICH YOU HAVE NEGLECTED
NOW MR
HOLMES YOU ARE IN FULL
POSSESSION OF THE FACTS
WHAT COURSE DO YOU RECOMMEND
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY
YOU THINK SIR THAT UNLESS THIS DOCUMENT IS RECOVERED THERE WILL BE
WAR
I THINK IT IS VERY PROBABLE
THEN SIR PREPARE FOR WAR
THAT IS A HARD SAYING MR
HOLMES
CONSIDER THE FACTS SIR
IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT IT WAS TAKEN AFTER
ELEVEN THIRTY AT NIGHT SINCE I UNDERSTAND THAT MR
HOPE AND HIS WIFE
WERE BOTH IN THE ROOM FROM THAT HOUR UNTIL THE LOSS WAS FOUND OUT
IT WAS TAKEN THEN YESTERDAY EVENING BETWEEN SEVEN THIRTY AND
ELEVEN THIRTY PROBABLY NEAR THE EARLIER HOUR SINCE WHOEVER TOOK IT
EVIDENTLY KNEW THAT IT WAS THERE AND WOULD NATURALLY SECURE IT AS EARLY
AS POSSIBLE
NOW SIR IF A DOCUMENT OF THIS IMPORTANCE WERE TAKEN AT
THAT HOUR WHERE CAN IT BE NOW NO ONE HAS ANY REASON TO RETAIN IT
IT
HAS BEEN PASSED RAPIDLY ON TO THOSE WHO NEED IT
WHAT CHANCE HAVE WE NOW
TO OVERTAKE OR EVEN TO TRACE IT IT IS BEYOND OUR REACH
THE PRIME MINISTER ROSE FROM THE SETTEE
WHAT YOU SAY IS PERFECTLY LOGICAL MR
HOLMES
I FEEL THAT THE MATTER
IS INDEED OUT OF OUR HANDS
LET US PRESUME FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE THAT THE DOCUMENT WAS TAKEN BY THE
MAID OR BY THE VALET
THEY ARE BOTH OLD AND TRIED SERVANTS
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT YOUR ROOM IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR THAT
THERE IS NO ENTRANCE FROM WITHOUT AND THAT FROM WITHIN NO ONE COULD GO
UP UNOBSERVED
IT MUST THEN BE SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE WHO HAS TAKEN IT
TO WHOM WOULD THE THIEF TAKE IT TO ONE OF SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL SPIES
AND SECRET AGENTS WHOSE NAMES ARE TOLERABLY FAMILIAR TO ME
THERE ARE
THREE WHO MAY BE SAID TO BE THE HEADS OF THEIR PROFESSION
I WILL BEGIN
MY RESEARCH BY GOING ROUND AND FINDING IF EACH OF THEM IS AT HIS POST
IF ONE IS MISSING ESPECIALLY IF HE HAS DISAPPEARED SINCE LAST NIGHT WE
WILL HAVE SOME INDICATION AS TO WHERE THE DOCUMENT HAS GONE
WHY SHOULD HE BE MISSING ASKED THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY
HE WOULD TAKE
THE LETTER TO AN EMBASSY IN LONDON AS LIKELY AS NOT
I FANCY NOT
THESE AGENTS WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH
THE EMBASSIES ARE OFTEN STRAINED
THE PRIME MINISTER NODDED HIS ACQUIESCENCE
I BELIEVE YOU ARE RIGHT MR
HOLMES
HE WOULD TAKE SO VALUABLE A PRIZE
TO HEADQUARTERS WITH HIS OWN HANDS
I THINK THAT YOUR COURSE OF ACTION
IS AN EXCELLENT ONE
MEANWHILE HOPE WE CANNOT NEGLECT ALL OUR OTHER
DUTIES ON ACCOUNT OF THIS ONE MISFORTUNE
SHOULD THERE BE ANY FRESH
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE DAY WE SHALL COMMUNICATE WITH YOU AND YOU WILL
NO DOUBT LET US KNOW THE RESULTS OF YOUR OWN INQUIRIES
THE TWO STATESMEN BOWED AND WALKED GRAVELY FROM THE ROOM
WHEN OUR ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS HAD DEPARTED HOLMES LIT HIS PIPE IN
SILENCE AND SAT FOR SOME TIME LOST IN THE DEEPEST THOUGHT
I HAD OPENED
THE MORNING PAPER AND WAS IMMERSED IN A SENSATIONAL CRIME WHICH HAD
OCCURRED IN LONDON THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN MY FRIEND GAVE AN EXCLAMATION
SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND LAID HIS PIPE DOWN UPON THE MANTELPIECE
YES SAID HE THERE IS NO BETTER WAY OF APPROACHING IT
THE SITUATION
IS DESPERATE BUT NOT HOPELESS
EVEN NOW IF WE COULD BE SURE WHICH OF
THEM HAS TAKEN IT IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT HAS NOT YET PASSED OUT OF
HIS HANDS
AFTER ALL IT IS A QUESTION OF MONEY WITH THESE FELLOWS AND
I HAVE THE BRITISH TREASURY BEHIND ME
IF IT'S ON THE MARKET I'LL BUY
IT IF IT MEANS ANOTHER PENNY ON THE INCOME TAX
IT IS CONCEIVABLE
THAT THE FELLOW MIGHT HOLD IT BACK TO SEE WHAT BIDS COME FROM THIS
SIDE BEFORE HE TRIES HIS LUCK ON THE OTHER
THERE ARE ONLY THOSE THREE
CAPABLE OF PLAYING SO BOLD A GAME THERE ARE OBERSTEIN LA ROTHIERE AND
EDUARDO LUCAS
I WILL SEE EACH OF THEM
I GLANCED AT MY MORNING PAPER
IS THAT EDUARDO LUCAS OF GODOLPHIN STREET
YES
YOU WILL NOT SEE HIM
WHY NOT
HE WAS MURDERED IN HIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT
MY FRIEND HAS SO OFTEN ASTONISHED ME IN THE COURSE OF OUR ADVENTURES
THAT IT WAS WITH A SENSE OF EXULTATION THAT I REALIZED HOW COMPLETELY I
HAD ASTONISHED HIM
HE STARED IN AMAZEMENT AND THEN SNATCHED THE
PAPER FROM MY HANDS
THIS WAS THE PARAGRAPH WHICH I HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN
READING WHEN HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
MURDER IN WESTMINSTER
A CRIME OF MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER WAS COMMITTED LAST NIGHT AT 16 GODOLPHIN
STREET ONE OF THE OLD FASHIONED AND SECLUDED ROWS OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
HOUSES WHICH LIE BETWEEN THE RIVER AND THE ABBEY ALMOST IN THE SHADOW
OF THE GREAT TOWER OF THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT
THIS SMALL BUT SELECT
MANSION HAS BEEN INHABITED FOR SOME YEARS BY MR
EDUARDO LUCAS WELL
KNOWN IN SOCIETY CIRCLES BOTH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CHARMING PERSONALITY
AND BECAUSE HE HAS THE WELL DESERVED REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE
BEST AMATEUR TENORS IN THE COUNTRY
MR
LUCAS IS AN UNMARRIED MAN
THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE AND HIS ESTABLISHMENT CONSISTS OF MRS
PRINGLE AN ELDERLY HOUSEKEEPER AND OF MITTON HIS VALET
THE FORMER
RETIRES EARLY AND SLEEPS AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE
THE VALET WAS OUT FOR
THE EVENING VISITING A FRIEND AT HAMMERSMITH
FROM TEN O'CLOCK ONWARD
MR
LUCAS HAD THE HOUSE TO HIMSELF
WHAT OCCURRED DURING THAT TIME HAS
NOT YET TRANSPIRED BUT AT A QUARTER TO TWELVE POLICE CONSTABLE BARRETT
PASSING ALONG GODOLPHIN STREET OBSERVED THAT THE DOOR OF NO
16 WAS
AJAR
HE KNOCKED BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
PERCEIVING A LIGHT IN THE
FRONT ROOM HE ADVANCED INTO THE PASSAGE AND AGAIN KNOCKED BUT WITHOUT
REPLY
HE THEN PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ENTERED
THE ROOM WAS IN A STATE
OF WILD DISORDER THE FURNITURE BEING ALL SWEPT TO ONE SIDE AND ONE
CHAIR LYING ON ITS BACK IN THE CENTRE
BESIDE THIS CHAIR AND STILL
GRASPING ONE OF ITS LEGS LAY THE UNFORTUNATE TENANT OF THE HOUSE
HE
HAD BEEN STABBED TO THE HEART AND MUST HAVE DIED INSTANTLY
THE KNIFE
WITH WHICH THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED WAS A CURVED INDIAN DAGGER
PLUCKED DOWN FROM A TROPHY OF ORIENTAL ARMS WHICH ADORNED ONE OF THE
WALLS
ROBBERY DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN THE MOTIVE OF THE CRIME FOR
THERE HAD BEEN NO ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE VALUABLE CONTENTS OF THE ROOM
MR
EDUARDO LUCAS WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND POPULAR THAT HIS VIOLENT AND
MYSTERIOUS FATE WILL AROUSE PAINFUL INTEREST AND INTENSE SYMPATHY IN A
WIDESPREAD CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
WELL WATSON WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS ASKED HOLMES AFTER A LONG
PAUSE
IT IS AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE
A COINCIDENCE HERE IS ONE OF THE THREE MEN WHOM WE HAD NAMED AS
POSSIBLE ACTORS IN THIS DRAMA AND HE MEETS A VIOLENT DEATH DURING THE
VERY HOURS WHEN WE KNOW THAT THAT DRAMA WAS BEING ENACTED
THE ODDS ARE
ENORMOUS AGAINST ITS BEING COINCIDENCE
NO FIGURES COULD EXPRESS THEM
NO MY DEAR WATSON THE TWO EVENTS ARE CONNECTED MUST BE CONNECTED
IT
IS FOR US TO FIND THE CONNECTION
BUT NOW THE OFFICIAL POLICE MUST KNOW ALL
NOT AT ALL
THEY KNOW ALL THEY SEE AT GODOLPHIN STREET
THEY KNOW AND
SHALL KNOW NOTHING OF WHITEHALL TERRACE
ONLY WE KNOW OF BOTH EVENTS
AND CAN TRACE THE RELATION BETWEEN THEM
THERE IS ONE OBVIOUS POINT
WHICH WOULD IN ANY CASE HAVE TURNED MY SUSPICIONS AGAINST LUCAS
GODOLPHIN STREET WESTMINSTER IS ONLY A FEW MINUTES' WALK FROM
WHITEHALL TERRACE
THE OTHER SECRET AGENTS WHOM I HAVE NAMED LIVE IN
THE EXTREME WEST END
IT WAS EASIER THEREFORE FOR LUCAS THAN FOR THE
OTHERS TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION OR RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM THE
EUROPEAN SECRETARY'S HOUSEHOLD A SMALL THING AND YET WHERE EVENTS ARE
COMPRESSED INTO A FEW HOURS IT MAY PROVE ESSENTIAL
HALLOA WHAT HAVE WE
HERE
MRS
HUDSON HAD APPEARED WITH A LADY'S CARD UPON HER SALVER
HOLMES
GLANCED AT IT RAISED HIS EYEBROWS AND HANDED IT OVER TO ME
ASK LADY HILDA TRELAWNEY HOPE IF SHE WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO STEP UP
SAID HE
A MOMENT LATER OUR MODEST APARTMENT ALREADY SO DISTINGUISHED THAT
MORNING WAS FURTHER HONOURED BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE MOST LOVELY WOMAN
IN LONDON
I HAD OFTEN HEARD OF THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER OF
THE DUKE OF BELMINSTER BUT NO DESCRIPTION OF IT AND NO CONTEMPLATION
OF COLOURLESS PHOTOGRAPHS HAD PREPARED ME FOR THE SUBTLE DELICATE
CHARM AND THE BEAUTIFUL COLOURING OF THAT EXQUISITE HEAD
AND YET AS
WE SAW IT THAT AUTUMN MORNING IT WAS NOT ITS BEAUTY WHICH WOULD BE THE
FIRST THING TO IMPRESS THE OBSERVER
THE CHEEK WAS LOVELY BUT IT WAS
PALED WITH EMOTION THE EYES WERE BRIGHT BUT IT WAS THE BRIGHTNESS
OF FEVER THE SENSITIVE MOUTH WAS TIGHT AND DRAWN IN AN EFFORT AFTER
SELF COMMAND
TERROR NOT BEAUTY WAS WHAT SPRANG FIRST TO THE EYE AS
OUR FAIR VISITOR STOOD FRAMED FOR AN INSTANT IN THE OPEN DOOR
HAS MY HUSBAND BEEN HERE MR
HOLMES
YES MADAM HE HAS BEEN HERE
MR
HOLMES
I IMPLORE YOU NOT TO TELL HIM THAT I CAME HERE HOLMES
BOWED COLDLY AND MOTIONED THE LADY TO A CHAIR
YOUR LADYSHIP PLACES ME IN A VERY DELICATE POSITION
I BEG THAT YOU
WILL SIT DOWN AND TELL ME WHAT YOU DESIRE BUT I FEAR THAT I CANNOT MAKE
ANY UNCONDITIONAL PROMISE
SHE SWEPT ACROSS THE ROOM AND SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO THE
WINDOW
IT WAS A QUEENLY PRESENCE TALL GRACEFUL AND INTENSELY
WOMANLY
MR
HOLMES SHE SAID AND HER WHITE GLOVED HANDS CLASPED AND
UNCLASPED AS SHE SPOKE I WILL SPEAK FRANKLY TO YOU IN THE HOPES
THAT IT MAY INDUCE YOU TO SPEAK FRANKLY IN RETURN
THERE IS COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND ME ON ALL MATTERS SAVE ONE
THAT ONE
IS POLITICS
ON THIS HIS LIPS ARE SEALED
HE TELLS ME NOTHING
NOW I
AM AWARE THAT THERE WAS A MOST DEPLORABLE OCCURRENCE IN OUR HOUSE LAST
NIGHT
I KNOW THAT A PAPER HAS DISAPPEARED
BUT BECAUSE THE MATTER IS
POLITICAL MY HUSBAND REFUSES TO TAKE ME INTO HIS COMPLETE CONFIDENCE
NOW IT IS ESSENTIAL ESSENTIAL I SAY THAT I SHOULD THOROUGHLY
UNDERSTAND IT
YOU ARE THE ONLY OTHER PERSON SAVE ONLY THESE
POLITICIANS WHO KNOWS THE TRUE FACTS
I BEG YOU THEN MR
HOLMES TO
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHAT IT WILL LEAD TO
TELL ME ALL
MR
HOLMES
LET NO REGARD FOR YOUR CLIENT'S INTERESTS KEEP YOU SILENT
FOR I ASSURE YOU THAT HIS INTERESTS IF HE WOULD ONLY SEE IT WOULD BE
BEST SERVED BY TAKING ME INTO HIS COMPLETE CONFIDENCE
WHAT WAS THIS
PAPER WHICH WAS STOLEN
MADAM WHAT YOU ASK ME IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE
SHE GROANED AND SANK HER FACE IN HER HANDS
YOU MUST SEE THAT THIS IS SO MADAM
IF YOUR HUSBAND THINKS FIT TO KEEP
YOU IN THE DARK OVER THIS MATTER IS IT FOR ME WHO HAS ONLY LEARNED THE
TRUE FACTS UNDER THE PLEDGE OF PROFESSIONAL SECRECY TO TELL WHAT HE HAS
WITHHELD IT IS NOT FAIR TO ASK IT
IT IS HIM WHOM YOU MUST ASK
I HAVE ASKED HIM
I COME TO YOU AS A LAST RESOURCE
BUT WITHOUT YOUR
TELLING ME ANYTHING DEFINITE MR
HOLMES YOU MAY DO A GREAT SERVICE IF
YOU WOULD ENLIGHTEN ME ON ONE POINT
WHAT IS IT MADAM
IS MY HUSBAND'S POLITICAL CAREER LIKELY TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS
INCIDENT
WELL MADAM UNLESS IT IS SET RIGHT IT MAY CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY
UNFORTUNATE EFFECT
AH SHE DREW IN HER BREATH SHARPLY AS ONE WHOSE DOUBTS ARE RESOLVED
ONE MORE QUESTION MR
HOLMES
FROM AN EXPRESSION WHICH MY HUSBAND
DROPPED IN THE FIRST SHOCK OF THIS DISASTER I UNDERSTOOD THAT TERRIBLE
PUBLIC CONSEQUENCES MIGHT ARISE FROM THE LOSS OF THIS DOCUMENT
IF HE SAID SO I CERTAINLY CANNOT DENY IT
OF WHAT NATURE ARE THEY
NAY MADAM THERE AGAIN YOU ASK ME MORE THAN I CAN POSSIBLY ANSWER
THEN I WILL TAKE UP NO MORE OF YOUR TIME
I CANNOT BLAME YOU MR
HOLMES FOR HAVING REFUSED TO SPEAK MORE FREELY AND YOU ON YOUR SIDE
WILL NOT I AM SURE THINK THE WORSE OF ME BECAUSE I DESIRE EVEN
AGAINST HIS WILL TO SHARE MY HUSBAND'S ANXIETIES
ONCE MORE I BEG THAT
YOU WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY VISIT
SHE LOOKED BACK AT US FROM THE DOOR AND I HAD A LAST IMPRESSION OF THAT
BEAUTIFUL HAUNTED FACE THE STARTLED EYES AND THE DRAWN MOUTH
THEN SHE
WAS GONE
NOW WATSON THE FAIR SEX IS YOUR DEPARTMENT SAID HOLMES WITH A
SMILE WHEN THE DWINDLING FROU FROU OF SKIRTS HAD ENDED IN THE SLAM
OF THE FRONT DOOR
WHAT WAS THE FAIR LADY'S GAME WHAT DID SHE REALLY
WANT
SURELY HER OWN STATEMENT IS CLEAR AND HER ANXIETY VERY NATURAL
HUM THINK OF HER APPEARANCE WATSON HER MANNER HER SUPPRESSED
EXCITEMENT HER RESTLESSNESS HER TENACITY IN ASKING QUESTIONS
REMEMBER
THAT SHE COMES OF A CASTE WHO DO NOT LIGHTLY SHOW EMOTION
SHE WAS CERTAINLY MUCH MOVED
REMEMBER ALSO THE CURIOUS EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH SHE ASSURED US THAT IT
WAS BEST FOR HER HUSBAND THAT SHE SHOULD KNOW ALL
WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY
THAT AND YOU MUST HAVE OBSERVED WATSON HOW SHE MANOEUVRED TO HAVE THE
LIGHT AT HER BACK
SHE DID NOT WISH US TO READ HER EXPRESSION
YES SHE CHOSE THE ONE CHAIR IN THE ROOM
AND YET THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN ARE SO INSCRUTABLE
YOU REMEMBER THE
WOMAN AT MARGATE WHOM I SUSPECTED FOR THE SAME REASON
NO POWDER ON HER
NOSE THAT PROVED TO BE THE CORRECT SOLUTION
HOW CAN YOU BUILD ON SUCH
A QUICKSAND THEIR MOST TRIVIAL ACTION MAY MEAN VOLUMES OR THEIR MOST
EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT MAY DEPEND UPON A HAIRPIN OR A CURLING TONGS
GOOD MORNING WATSON
YOU ARE OFF
YES I WILL WHILE AWAY THE MORNING AT GODOLPHIN STREET WITH OUR FRIENDS
OF THE REGULAR ESTABLISHMENT
WITH EDUARDO LUCAS LIES THE SOLUTION OF
OUR PROBLEM THOUGH I MUST ADMIT THAT I HAVE NOT AN INKLING AS TO WHAT
FORM IT MAY TAKE
IT IS A CAPITAL MISTAKE TO THEORIZE IN ADVANCE OF
THE FACTS
DO YOU STAY ON GUARD MY GOOD WATSON AND RECEIVE ANY FRESH
VISITORS
I'LL JOIN YOU AT LUNCH IF I AM ABLE
ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT AND THE NEXT HOLMES WAS IN A MOOD WHICH HIS
FRIENDS WOULD CALL TACITURN AND OTHERS MOROSE
HE RAN OUT AND RAN IN
SMOKED INCESSANTLY PLAYED SNATCHES ON HIS VIOLIN SANK INTO REVERIES
DEVOURED SANDWICHES AT IRREGULAR HOURS AND HARDLY ANSWERED THE CASUAL
QUESTIONS WHICH I PUT TO HIM
IT WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT THINGS WERE NOT
GOING WELL WITH HIM OR HIS QUEST
HE WOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CASE AND
IT WAS FROM THE PAPERS THAT I LEARNED THE PARTICULARS OF THE INQUEST
AND THE ARREST WITH THE SUBSEQUENT RELEASE OF JOHN MITTON THE VALET OF
THE DECEASED
THE CORONER'S JURY BROUGHT IN THE OBVIOUS WILFUL MURDER
BUT THE PARTIES REMAINED AS UNKNOWN AS EVER
NO MOTIVE WAS SUGGESTED
THE ROOM WAS FULL OF ARTICLES OF VALUE BUT NONE HAD BEEN TAKEN
THE
DEAD MAN'S PAPERS HAD NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH
THEY WERE CAREFULLY
EXAMINED AND SHOWED THAT HE WAS A KEEN STUDENT OF INTERNATIONAL
POLITICS AN INDEFATIGABLE GOSSIP A REMARKABLE LINGUIST AND AN
UNTIRING LETTER WRITER
HE HAD BEEN ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH THE LEADING
POLITICIANS OF SEVERAL COUNTRIES
BUT NOTHING SENSATIONAL WAS DISCOVERED
AMONG THE DOCUMENTS WHICH FILLED HIS DRAWERS
AS TO HIS RELATIONS WITH
WOMEN THEY APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN PROMISCUOUS BUT SUPERFICIAL
HE HAD
MANY ACQUAINTANCES AMONG THEM BUT FEW FRIENDS AND NO ONE WHOM HE
LOVED
HIS HABITS WERE REGULAR HIS CONDUCT INOFFENSIVE
HIS DEATH WAS
AN ABSOLUTE MYSTERY AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO
AS TO THE ARREST OF JOHN MITTON THE VALET IT WAS A COUNCIL OF DESPAIR
AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ABSOLUTE INACTION
BUT NO CASE COULD BE SUSTAINED
AGAINST HIM
HE HAD VISITED FRIENDS IN HAMMERSMITH THAT NIGHT
THE ALIBI
WAS COMPLETE
IT IS TRUE THAT HE STARTED HOME AT AN HOUR WHICH SHOULD
HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO WESTMINSTER BEFORE THE TIME WHEN THE CRIME WAS
DISCOVERED BUT HIS OWN EXPLANATION THAT HE HAD WALKED PART OF THE WAY
SEEMED PROBABLE ENOUGH IN VIEW OF THE FINENESS OF THE NIGHT
HE HAD
ACTUALLY ARRIVED AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AND APPEARED TO BE OVERWHELMED
BY THE UNEXPECTED TRAGEDY
HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ON GOOD TERMS WITH HIS
MASTER
SEVERAL OF THE DEAD MAN'S POSSESSIONS NOTABLY A SMALL CASE OF
RAZORS HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE VALET'S BOXES BUT HE EXPLAINED THAT THEY
HAD BEEN PRESENTS FROM THE DECEASED AND THE HOUSEKEEPER WAS ABLE TO
CORROBORATE THE STORY
MITTON HAD BEEN IN LUCAS'S EMPLOYMENT FOR THREE
YEARS
IT WAS NOTICEABLE THAT LUCAS DID NOT TAKE MITTON ON THE CONTINENT
WITH HIM
SOMETIMES HE VISITED PARIS FOR THREE MONTHS ON END BUT MITTON
WAS LEFT IN CHARGE OF THE GODOLPHIN STREET HOUSE
AS TO THE HOUSEKEEPER
SHE HAD HEARD NOTHING ON THE NIGHT OF THE CRIME
IF HER MASTER HAD A
VISITOR HE HAD HIMSELF ADMITTED HIM
SO FOR THREE MORNINGS THE MYSTERY REMAINED SO FAR AS I COULD FOLLOW IT
IN THE PAPERS
IF HOLMES KNEW MORE HE KEPT HIS OWN COUNSEL BUT AS
HE TOLD ME THAT INSPECTOR LESTRADE HAD TAKEN HIM INTO HIS
CONFIDENCE IN THE CASE I KNEW THAT HE WAS IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH EVERY
DEVELOPMENT
UPON THE FOURTH DAY THERE APPEARED A LONG TELEGRAM FROM
PARIS WHICH SEEMED TO SOLVE THE WHOLE QUESTION
A DISCOVERY HAS JUST BEEN MADE BY THE PARISIAN POLICE SAID THE DAILY
TELEGRAPH WHICH RAISES THE VEIL WHICH HUNG ROUND THE TRAGIC FATE OF
MR
EDUARDO LUCAS WHO MET HIS DEATH BY VIOLENCE LAST MONDAY NIGHT
AT GODOLPHIN STREET WESTMINSTER
OUR READERS WILL REMEMBER THAT
THE DECEASED GENTLEMAN WAS FOUND STABBED IN HIS ROOM AND THAT SOME
SUSPICION ATTACHED TO HIS VALET BUT THAT THE CASE BROKE DOWN ON AN
ALIBI
YESTERDAY A LADY WHO HAS BEEN KNOWN AS MME
HENRI FOURNAYE
OCCUPYING A SMALL VILLA IN THE RUE AUSTERLITZ WAS REPORTED TO THE
AUTHORITIES BY HER SERVANTS AS BEING INSANE
AN EXAMINATION SHOWED
SHE HAD INDEED DEVELOPED MANIA OF A DANGEROUS AND PERMANENT FORM
ON INQUIRY THE POLICE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT MME
HENRI FOURNAYE ONLY
RETURNED FROM A JOURNEY TO LONDON ON TUESDAY LAST AND THERE IS
EVIDENCE TO CONNECT HER WITH THE CRIME AT WESTMINSTER
A COMPARISON OF
PHOTOGRAPHS HAS PROVED CONCLUSIVELY THAT M
HENRI FOURNAYE AND EDUARDO
LUCAS WERE REALLY ONE AND THE SAME PERSON AND THAT THE DECEASED HAD FOR
SOME REASON LIVED A DOUBLE LIFE IN LONDON AND PARIS
MME
FOURNAYE
WHO IS OF CREOLE ORIGIN IS OF AN EXTREMELY EXCITABLE NATURE AND HAS
SUFFERED IN THE PAST FROM ATTACKS OF JEALOUSY WHICH HAVE AMOUNTED TO
FRENZY
IT IS CONJECTURED THAT IT WAS IN ONE OF THESE THAT SHE COMMITTED
THE TERRIBLE CRIME WHICH HAS CAUSED SUCH A SENSATION IN LONDON
HER
MOVEMENTS UPON THE MONDAY NIGHT HAVE NOT YET BEEN TRACED BUT IT IS
UNDOUBTED THAT A WOMAN ANSWERING TO HER DESCRIPTION ATTRACTED MUCH
ATTENTION AT CHARING CROSS STATION ON TUESDAY MORNING BY THE WILDNESS
OF HER APPEARANCE AND THE VIOLENCE OF HER GESTURES
IT IS PROBABLE
THEREFORE THAT THE CRIME WAS EITHER COMMITTED WHEN INSANE OR THAT
ITS IMMEDIATE EFFECT WAS TO DRIVE THE UNHAPPY WOMAN OUT OF HER MIND
AT
PRESENT SHE IS UNABLE TO GIVE ANY COHERENT ACCOUNT OF THE PAST AND THE
DOCTORS HOLD OUT NO HOPES OF THE REESTABLISHMENT OF HER REASON
THERE IS
EVIDENCE THAT A WOMAN WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN MME
FOURNAYE WAS SEEN FOR
SOME HOURS UPON MONDAY NIGHT WATCHING THE HOUSE IN GODOLPHIN STREET
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HOLMES I HAD READ THE ACCOUNT ALOUD TO
HIM WHILE HE FINISHED HIS BREAKFAST
MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE AS HE ROSE FROM THE TABLE AND PACED UP AND
DOWN THE ROOM YOU ARE MOST LONG SUFFERING BUT IF I HAVE TOLD YOU
NOTHING IN THE LAST THREE DAYS IT IS BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING TO TELL
EVEN NOW THIS REPORT FROM PARIS DOES NOT HELP US MUCH
SURELY IT IS FINAL AS REGARDS THE MAN'S DEATH
THE MAN'S DEATH IS A MERE INCIDENT A TRIVIAL EPISODE IN COMPARISON
WITH OUR REAL TASK WHICH IS TO TRACE THIS DOCUMENT AND SAVE A EUROPEAN
CATASTROPHE
ONLY ONE IMPORTANT THING HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE
DAYS AND THAT IS THAT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED
I GET REPORTS ALMOST HOURLY
FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT NOWHERE IN EUROPE IS THERE
ANY SIGN OF TROUBLE
NOW IF THIS LETTER WERE LOOSE NO IT CAN'T BE
LOOSE BUT IF IT ISN'T LOOSE WHERE CAN IT BE WHO HAS IT WHY IS IT
HELD BACK THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT BEATS IN MY BRAIN LIKE A HAMMER
WAS
IT INDEED A COINCIDENCE THAT LUCAS SHOULD MEET HIS DEATH ON THE NIGHT
WHEN THE LETTER DISAPPEARED DID THE LETTER EVER REACH HIM IF SO WHY
IS IT NOT AMONG HIS PAPERS DID THIS MAD WIFE OF HIS CARRY IT OFF WITH
HER IF SO IS IT IN HER HOUSE IN PARIS HOW COULD I SEARCH FOR IT
WITHOUT THE FRENCH POLICE HAVING THEIR SUSPICIONS AROUSED IT IS A CASE
MY DEAR WATSON WHERE THE LAW IS AS DANGEROUS TO US AS THE CRIMINALS
ARE
EVERY MAN'S HAND IS AGAINST US AND YET THE INTERESTS AT STAKE
ARE COLOSSAL
SHOULD I BRING IT TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION IT WILL
CERTAINLY REPRESENT THE CROWNING GLORY OF MY CAREER
AH HERE IS MY
LATEST FROM THE FRONT HE GLANCED HURRIEDLY AT THE NOTE WHICH HAD
BEEN HANDED IN
HALLOA LESTRADE SEEMS TO HAVE OBSERVED SOMETHING OF
INTEREST
PUT ON YOUR HAT WATSON AND WE WILL STROLL DOWN TOGETHER TO
WESTMINSTER
IT WAS MY FIRST VISIT TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME A HIGH DINGY
NARROW CHESTED HOUSE PRIM FORMAL AND SOLID LIKE THE CENTURY WHICH
GAVE IT BIRTH
LESTRADE'S BULLDOG FEATURES GAZED OUT AT US FROM THE
FRONT WINDOW AND HE GREETED US WARMLY WHEN A BIG CONSTABLE HAD OPENED
THE DOOR AND LET US IN
THE ROOM INTO WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS THAT IN
WHICH THE CRIME HAD BEEN COMMITTED BUT NO TRACE OF IT NOW REMAINED SAVE
AN UGLY IRREGULAR STAIN UPON THE CARPET
THIS CARPET WAS A SMALL SQUARE
DRUGGET IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM SURROUNDED BY A BROAD EXPANSE
OF BEAUTIFUL OLD FASHIONED WOOD FLOORING IN SQUARE BLOCKS HIGHLY
POLISHED
OVER THE FIREPLACE WAS A MAGNIFICENT TROPHY OF WEAPONS ONE OF
WHICH HAD BEEN USED ON THAT TRAGIC NIGHT
IN THE WINDOW WAS A SUMPTUOUS
WRITING DESK AND EVERY DETAIL OF THE APARTMENT THE PICTURES THE RUGS
AND THE HANGINGS ALL POINTED TO A TASTE WHICH WAS LUXURIOUS TO THE
VERGE OF EFFEMINACY
SEEN THE PARIS NEWS ASKED LESTRADE
HOLMES NODDED
OUR FRENCH FRIENDS SEEM TO HAVE TOUCHED THE SPOT THIS TIME
NO DOUBT
IT'S JUST AS THEY SAY
SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR SURPRISE VISIT I
GUESS FOR HE KEPT HIS LIFE IN WATER TIGHT COMPARTMENTS HE LET HER IN
COULDN'T KEEP HER IN THE STREET
SHE TOLD HIM HOW SHE HAD TRACED HIM
REPROACHED HIM
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER AND THEN WITH THAT DAGGER SO
HANDY THE END SOON CAME
IT WASN'T ALL DONE IN AN INSTANT THOUGH FOR
THESE CHAIRS WERE ALL SWEPT OVER YONDER AND HE HAD ONE IN HIS HAND AS
IF HE HAD TRIED TO HOLD HER OFF WITH IT
WE'VE GOT IT ALL CLEAR AS IF WE
HAD SEEN IT
HOLMES RAISED HIS EYEBROWS
AND YET YOU HAVE SENT FOR ME
AH YES THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER A MERE TRIFLE BUT THE SORT OF THING
YOU TAKE AN INTEREST IN QUEER YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
FREAKISH
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MAIN FACT CAN'T HAVE ON THE
FACE OF IT
WHAT IS IT THEN
WELL YOU KNOW AFTER A CRIME OF THIS SORT WE ARE VERY CAREFUL TO KEEP
THINGS IN THEIR POSITION
NOTHING HAS BEEN MOVED
OFFICER IN CHARGE HERE
DAY AND NIGHT
THIS MORNING AS THE MAN WAS BURIED AND THE INVESTIGATION
OVER SO FAR AS THIS ROOM IS CONCERNED WE THOUGHT WE COULD TIDY UP
A BIT
THIS CARPET
YOU SEE IT IS NOT FASTENED DOWN ONLY JUST LAID
THERE
WE HAD OCCASION TO RAISE IT
WE FOUND
YES YOU FOUND
HOLMES'S FACE GREW TENSE WITH ANXIETY
WELL I'M SURE YOU WOULD NEVER GUESS IN A HUNDRED YEARS WHAT WE DID
FIND
YOU SEE THAT STAIN ON THE CARPET WELL A GREAT DEAL MUST HAVE
SOAKED THROUGH MUST IT NOT
UNDOUBTEDLY IT MUST
WELL YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THERE IS NO STAIN ON THE WHITE
WOODWORK TO CORRESPOND
NO STAIN BUT THERE MUST
YES SO YOU WOULD SAY
BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE ISN'T
HE TOOK THE CORNER OF THE CARPET IN HIS HAND AND TURNING IT OVER HE
SHOWED THAT IT WAS INDEED AS HE SAID
BUT THE UNDER SIDE IS AS STAINED AS THE UPPER
IT MUST HAVE LEFT A
MARK
LESTRADE CHUCKLED WITH DELIGHT AT HAVING PUZZLED THE FAMOUS EXPERT
NOW I'LL SHOW YOU THE EXPLANATION
THERE IS A SECOND STAIN BUT IT
DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE OTHER
SEE FOR YOURSELF AS HE SPOKE HE
TURNED OVER ANOTHER PORTION OF THE CARPET AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS
A GREAT CRIMSON SPILL UPON THE SQUARE WHITE FACING OF THE OLD FASHIONED
FLOOR
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT MR
HOLMES
WHY IT IS SIMPLE ENOUGH
THE TWO STAINS DID CORRESPOND BUT THE CARPET
HAS BEEN TURNED ROUND
AS IT WAS SQUARE AND UNFASTENED IT WAS EASILY
DONE
THE OFFICIAL POLICE DON'T NEED YOU MR
HOLMES TO TELL THEM THAT THE
CARPET MUST HAVE BEEN TURNED ROUND
THAT'S CLEAR ENOUGH FOR THE STAINS
LIE ABOVE EACH OTHER IF YOU LAY IT OVER THIS WAY
BUT WHAT I WANT TO
KNOW IS WHO SHIFTED THE CARPET AND WHY
I COULD SEE FROM HOLMES'S RIGID FACE THAT HE WAS VIBRATING WITH INWARD
EXCITEMENT
LOOK HERE LESTRADE SAID HE HAS THAT CONSTABLE IN THE PASSAGE BEEN
IN CHARGE OF THE PLACE ALL THE TIME
YES HE HAS
WELL TAKE MY ADVICE
EXAMINE HIM CAREFULLY
DON'T DO IT BEFORE US
WE'LL WAIT HERE
YOU TAKE HIM INTO THE BACK ROOM
YOU'LL BE MORE LIKELY
TO GET A CONFESSION OUT OF HIM ALONE
ASK HIM HOW HE DARED TO ADMIT
PEOPLE AND LEAVE THEM ALONE IN THIS ROOM
DON'T ASK HIM IF HE HAS DONE
IT
TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
TELL HIM YOU KNOW SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE
PRESS
HIM
TELL HIM THAT A FULL CONFESSION IS HIS ONLY CHANCE OF FORGIVENESS
DO EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU
BY GEORGE IF HE KNOWS I'LL HAVE IT OUT OF HIM CRIED LESTRADE
HE
DARTED INTO THE HALL AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER HIS BULLYING VOICE SOUNDED
FROM THE BACK ROOM
NOW WATSON NOW CRIED HOLMES WITH FRENZIED EAGERNESS
ALL THE
DEMONIACAL FORCE OF THE MAN MASKED BEHIND THAT LISTLESS MANNER BURST OUT
IN A PAROXYSM OF ENERGY
HE TORE THE DRUGGET FROM THE FLOOR AND IN AN
INSTANT WAS DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES CLAWING AT EACH OF THE SQUARES
OF WOOD BENEATH IT
ONE TURNED SIDEWAYS AS HE DUG HIS NAILS INTO THE
EDGE OF IT
IT HINGED BACK LIKE THE LID OF A BOX
A SMALL BLACK CAVITY
OPENED BENEATH IT
HOLMES PLUNGED HIS EAGER HAND INTO IT AND DREW IT OUT
WITH A BITTER SNARL OF ANGER AND DISAPPOINTMENT
IT WAS EMPTY
QUICK WATSON QUICK GET IT BACK AGAIN THE WOODEN LID WAS REPLACED
AND THE DRUGGET HAD ONLY JUST BEEN DRAWN STRAIGHT WHEN LESTRADE'S VOICE
WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
HE FOUND HOLMES LEANING LANGUIDLY AGAINST
THE MANTELPIECE RESIGNED AND PATIENT ENDEAVOURING TO CONCEAL HIS
IRREPRESSIBLE YAWNS
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING MR
HOLMES I CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE BORED TO
DEATH WITH THE WHOLE AFFAIR
WELL HE HAS CONFESSED ALL RIGHT
COME
IN HERE MACPHERSON
LET THESE GENTLEMEN HEAR OF YOUR MOST INEXCUSABLE
CONDUCT
THE BIG CONSTABLE VERY HOT AND PENITENT SIDLED INTO THE ROOM
I MEANT NO HARM SIR I'M SURE
THE YOUNG WOMAN CAME TO THE DOOR LAST
EVENING MISTOOK THE HOUSE SHE DID
AND THEN WE GOT TALKING
IT'S
LONESOME WHEN YOU'RE ON DUTY HERE ALL DAY
WELL WHAT HAPPENED THEN
SHE WANTED TO SEE WHERE THE CRIME WAS DONE HAD READ ABOUT IT IN THE
PAPERS SHE SAID
SHE WAS A VERY RESPECTABLE WELL SPOKEN YOUNG WOMAN
SIR AND I SAW NO HARM IN LETTING HER HAVE A PEEP
WHEN SHE SAW THAT
MARK ON THE CARPET DOWN SHE DROPPED ON THE FLOOR AND LAY AS IF SHE
WERE DEAD
I RAN TO THE BACK AND GOT SOME WATER BUT I COULD NOT BRING
HER TO
THEN I WENT ROUND THE CORNER TO THE IVY PLANT FOR SOME BRANDY
AND BY THE TIME I HAD BROUGHT IT BACK THE YOUNG WOMAN HAD RECOVERED AND
WAS OFF ASHAMED OF HERSELF I DARESAY AND DARED NOT FACE ME
HOW ABOUT MOVING THAT DRUGGET
WELL SIR IT WAS A BIT RUMPLED CERTAINLY WHEN I CAME BACK
YOU SEE
SHE FELL ON IT AND IT LIES ON A POLISHED FLOOR WITH NOTHING TO KEEP IT
IN PLACE
I STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AFTERWARDS
IT'S A LESSON TO YOU THAT YOU CAN'T DECEIVE ME CONSTABLE MACPHERSON
SAID LESTRADE WITH DIGNITY
NO DOUBT YOU THOUGHT THAT YOUR BREACH OF
DUTY COULD NEVER BE DISCOVERED AND YET A MERE GLANCE AT THAT DRUGGET
WAS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ME THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN ADMITTED TO THE ROOM
IT'S LUCKY FOR YOU MY MAN THAT NOTHING IS MISSING OR YOU WOULD FIND
YOURSELF IN QUEER STREET
I'M SORRY TO HAVE CALLED YOU DOWN OVER SUCH A
PETTY BUSINESS MR
HOLMES BUT I THOUGHT THE POINT OF THE SECOND STAIN
NOT CORRESPONDING WITH THE FIRST WOULD INTEREST YOU
CERTAINLY IT WAS MOST INTERESTING
HAS THIS WOMAN ONLY BEEN HERE ONCE
CONSTABLE
YES SIR ONLY ONCE
WHO WAS SHE
DON'T KNOW THE NAME SIR
WAS ANSWERING AN ADVERTISEMENT ABOUT
TYPEWRITING AND CAME TO THE WRONG NUMBER VERY PLEASANT GENTEEL YOUNG
WOMAN SIR
TALL HANDSOME
YES SIR SHE WAS A WELL GROWN YOUNG WOMAN
I SUPPOSE YOU MIGHT SAY
SHE WAS HANDSOME
PERHAPS SOME WOULD SAY SHE WAS VERY HANDSOME
'OH
OFFICER DO LET ME HAVE A PEEP SAYS SHE
SHE HAD PRETTY COAXING WAYS
AS YOU MIGHT SAY AND I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO HARM IN LETTING HER JUST
PUT HER HEAD THROUGH THE DOOR
HOW WAS SHE DRESSED
QUIET SIR A LONG MANTLE DOWN TO HER FEET
WHAT TIME WAS IT
IT WAS JUST GROWING DUSK AT THE TIME
THEY WERE LIGHTING THE LAMPS AS I
CAME BACK WITH THE BRANDY
VERY GOOD SAID HOLMES
COME WATSON I THINK THAT WE HAVE MORE
IMPORTANT WORK ELSEWHERE
AS WE LEFT THE HOUSE LESTRADE REMAINED IN THE FRONT ROOM WHILE THE
REPENTANT CONSTABLE OPENED THE DOOR TO LET US OUT
HOLMES TURNED ON THE
STEP AND HELD UP SOMETHING IN HIS HAND
THE CONSTABLE STARED INTENTLY
GOOD LORD SIR HE CRIED WITH AMAZEMENT ON HIS FACE
HOLMES PUT HIS
FINGER ON HIS LIPS REPLACED HIS HAND IN HIS BREAST POCKET AND BURST
OUT LAUGHING AS WE TURNED DOWN THE STREET
EXCELLENT SAID HE
COME
FRIEND WATSON THE CURTAIN RINGS UP FOR THE LAST ACT
YOU WILL BE
RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT THERE WILL BE NO WAR THAT THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
TRELAWNEY HOPE WILL SUFFER NO SETBACK IN HIS BRILLIANT CAREER THAT THE
INDISCREET SOVEREIGN WILL RECEIVE NO PUNISHMENT FOR HIS INDISCRETION
THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WILL HAVE NO EUROPEAN COMPLICATION TO DEAL
WITH AND THAT WITH A LITTLE TACT AND MANAGEMENT UPON OUR PART
NOBODY WILL BE A PENNY THE WORSE FOR WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A VERY UGLY
INCIDENT
MY MIND FILLED WITH ADMIRATION FOR THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN
YOU HAVE SOLVED IT I CRIED
HARDLY THAT WATSON
THERE ARE SOME POINTS WHICH ARE AS DARK AS EVER
BUT WE HAVE SO MUCH THAT IT WILL BE OUR OWN FAULT IF WE CANNOT GET THE
REST
WE WILL GO STRAIGHT TO WHITEHALL TERRACE AND BRING THE MATTER TO A
HEAD
WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE RESIDENCE OF THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY IT WAS FOR
LADY HILDA TRELAWNEY HOPE THAT SHERLOCK HOLMES INQUIRED
WE WERE SHOWN
INTO THE MORNING ROOM
MR
HOLMES SAID THE LADY AND HER FACE WAS PINK WITH HER INDIGNATION
THIS IS SURELY MOST UNFAIR AND UNGENEROUS UPON YOUR PART
I DESIRED
AS I HAVE EXPLAINED TO KEEP MY VISIT TO YOU A SECRET LEST MY HUSBAND
SHOULD THINK THAT I WAS INTRUDING INTO HIS AFFAIRS
AND YET YOU
COMPROMISE ME BY COMING HERE AND SO SHOWING THAT THERE ARE BUSINESS
RELATIONS BETWEEN US
UNFORTUNATELY MADAM I HAD NO POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE
I HAVE BEEN
COMMISSIONED TO RECOVER THIS IMMENSELY IMPORTANT PAPER
I MUST THEREFORE
ASK YOU MADAM TO BE KIND ENOUGH TO PLACE IT IN MY HANDS
THE LADY SPRANG TO HER FEET WITH THE COLOUR ALL DASHED IN AN INSTANT
FROM HER BEAUTIFUL FACE
HER EYES GLAZED SHE TOTTERED I THOUGHT THAT
SHE WOULD FAINT
THEN WITH A GRAND EFFORT SHE RALLIED FROM THE SHOCK
AND A SUPREME ASTONISHMENT AND INDIGNATION CHASED EVERY OTHER EXPRESSION
FROM HER FEATURES
YOU YOU INSULT ME MR
HOLMES
COME COME MADAM IT IS USELESS
GIVE UP THE LETTER
SHE DARTED TO THE BELL
THE BUTLER SHALL SHOW YOU OUT
DO NOT RING LADY HILDA
IF YOU DO THEN ALL MY EARNEST EFFORTS TO
AVOID A SCANDAL WILL BE FRUSTRATED
GIVE UP THE LETTER AND ALL WILL BE
SET RIGHT
IF YOU WILL WORK WITH ME I CAN ARRANGE EVERYTHING
IF YOU
WORK AGAINST ME I MUST EXPOSE YOU
SHE STOOD GRANDLY DEFIANT A QUEENLY FIGURE HER EYES FIXED UPON HIS AS
IF SHE WOULD READ HIS VERY SOUL
HER HAND WAS ON THE BELL BUT SHE HAD
FORBORNE TO RING IT
YOU ARE TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
IT IS NOT A VERY MANLY THING MR
HOLMES TO COME HERE AND BROWBEAT A WOMAN
YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW
SOMETHING
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU KNOW
PRAY SIT DOWN MADAM
YOU WILL HURT YOURSELF THERE IF YOU FALL
I WILL
NOT SPEAK UNTIL YOU SIT DOWN
THANK YOU
I GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES MR
HOLMES
ONE IS ENOUGH LADY HILDA
I KNOW OF YOUR VISIT TO EDUARDO LUCAS OF
YOUR GIVING HIM THIS DOCUMENT OF YOUR INGENIOUS RETURN TO THE ROOM
LAST NIGHT AND OF THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU TOOK THE LETTER FROM THE
HIDING PLACE UNDER THE CARPET
SHE STARED AT HIM WITH AN ASHEN FACE AND GULPED TWICE BEFORE SHE COULD
SPEAK
YOU ARE MAD MR
HOLMES YOU ARE MAD SHE CRIED AT LAST
HE DREW A SMALL PIECE OF CARDBOARD FROM HIS POCKET
IT WAS THE FACE OF A
WOMAN CUT OUT OF A PORTRAIT
I HAVE CARRIED THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL SAID HE
THE POLICEMAN HAS RECOGNIZED IT
SHE GAVE A GASP AND HER HEAD DROPPED BACK IN THE CHAIR
COME LADY HILDA
YOU HAVE THE LETTER
THE MATTER MAY STILL BE
ADJUSTED
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO BRING TROUBLE TO YOU
MY DUTY ENDS WHEN
I HAVE RETURNED THE LOST LETTER TO YOUR HUSBAND
TAKE MY ADVICE AND BE
FRANK WITH ME
IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE
HER COURAGE WAS ADMIRABLE
EVEN NOW SHE WOULD NOT OWN DEFEAT
I TELL YOU AGAIN MR
HOLMES THAT YOU ARE UNDER SOME ABSURD ILLUSION
HOLMES ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR
I AM SORRY FOR YOU LADY HILDA
I HAVE DONE MY BEST FOR YOU
I CAN SEE
THAT IT IS ALL IN VAIN
HE RANG THE BELL
THE BUTLER ENTERED
IS MR
TRELAWNEY HOPE AT HOME
HE WILL BE HOME SIR AT A QUARTER TO ONE
HOLMES GLANCED AT HIS WATCH
STILL A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAID HE
VERY GOOD I SHALL WAIT
THE BUTLER HAD HARDLY CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WHEN LADY HILDA
WAS DOWN ON HER KNEES AT HOLMES'S FEET HER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED HER
BEAUTIFUL FACE UPTURNED AND WET WITH HER TEARS
OH SPARE ME MR
HOLMES SPARE ME SHE PLEADED IN A FRENZY OF
SUPPLICATION
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DON'T TELL HIM I LOVE HIM SO I WOULD
NOT BRING ONE SHADOW ON HIS LIFE AND THIS I KNOW WOULD BREAK HIS NOBLE
HEART
HOLMES RAISED THE LADY
I AM THANKFUL MADAM THAT YOU HAVE COME TO
YOUR SENSES EVEN AT THIS LAST MOMENT THERE IS NOT AN INSTANT TO LOSE
WHERE IS THE LETTER
SHE DARTED ACROSS TO A WRITING DESK UNLOCKED IT AND DREW OUT A LONG
BLUE ENVELOPE
HERE IT IS MR
HOLMES
WOULD TO HEAVEN I HAD NEVER SEEN IT
HOW CAN WE RETURN IT HOLMES MUTTERED
QUICK QUICK WE MUST THINK OF
SOME WAY WHERE IS THE DESPATCH BOX
STILL IN HIS BEDROOM
WHAT A STROKE OF LUCK QUICK MADAM BRING IT HERE A MOMENT LATER SHE
HAD APPEARED WITH A RED FLAT BOX IN HER HAND
HOW DID YOU OPEN IT BEFORE YOU HAVE A DUPLICATE KEY YES OF COURSE
YOU HAVE
OPEN IT
FROM OUT OF HER BOSOM LADY HILDA HAD DRAWN A SMALL KEY
THE BOX FLEW
OPEN
IT WAS STUFFED WITH PAPERS
HOLMES THRUST THE BLUE ENVELOPE DEEP
DOWN INTO THE HEART OF THEM BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF SOME OTHER DOCUMENT
THE BOX WAS SHUT LOCKED AND RETURNED TO THE BEDROOM
NOW WE ARE READY FOR HIM SAID HOLMES
WE HAVE STILL TEN MINUTES
I AM GOING FAR TO SCREEN YOU LADY HILDA
IN RETURN YOU WILL SPEND
THE TIME IN TELLING ME FRANKLY THE REAL MEANING OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY
AFFAIR
MR
HOLMES I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING CRIED THE LADY
OH MR
HOLMES I WOULD CUT OFF MY RIGHT HAND BEFORE I GAVE HIM A MOMENT OF
SORROW THERE IS NO WOMAN IN ALL LONDON WHO LOVES HER HUSBAND AS I
DO AND YET IF HE KNEW HOW I HAVE ACTED HOW I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO
ACT HE WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
FOR HIS OWN HONOUR STANDS SO HIGH THAT
HE COULD NOT FORGET OR PARDON A LAPSE IN ANOTHER
HELP ME MR
HOLMES
MY HAPPINESS HIS HAPPINESS OUR VERY LIVES ARE AT STAKE
QUICK MADAM THE TIME GROWS SHORT
IT WAS A LETTER OF MINE MR
HOLMES AN INDISCREET LETTER WRITTEN
BEFORE MY MARRIAGE A FOOLISH LETTER A LETTER OF AN IMPULSIVE LOVING
GIRL
I MEANT NO HARM AND YET HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT CRIMINAL
HAD HE
READ THAT LETTER HIS CONFIDENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOREVER DESTROYED
IT
IS YEARS SINCE I WROTE IT
I HAD THOUGHT THAT THE WHOLE MATTER WAS
FORGOTTEN
THEN AT LAST I HEARD FROM THIS MAN LUCAS THAT IT HAD PASSED
INTO HIS HANDS AND THAT HE WOULD LAY IT BEFORE MY HUSBAND
I IMPLORED
HIS MERCY
HE SAID THAT HE WOULD RETURN MY LETTER IF I WOULD BRING HIM A
CERTAIN DOCUMENT WHICH HE DESCRIBED IN MY HUSBAND'S DESPATCH BOX
HE HAD
SOME SPY IN THE OFFICE WHO HAD TOLD HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
HE ASSURED ME
THAT NO HARM COULD COME TO MY HUSBAND
PUT YOURSELF IN MY POSITION MR
HOLMES WHAT WAS I TO DO
TAKE YOUR HUSBAND INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE
I COULD NOT MR
HOLMES I COULD NOT ON THE ONE SIDE SEEMED CERTAIN
RUIN ON THE OTHER TERRIBLE AS IT SEEMED TO TAKE MY HUSBAND'S PAPER
STILL IN A MATTER OF POLITICS I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES
WHILE IN A MATTER OF LOVE AND TRUST THEY WERE ONLY TOO CLEAR TO ME
I
DID IT MR
HOLMES I TOOK AN IMPRESSION OF HIS KEY
THIS MAN LUCAS
FURNISHED A DUPLICATE
I OPENED HIS DESPATCH BOX TOOK THE PAPER AND
CONVEYED IT TO GODOLPHIN STREET
WHAT HAPPENED THERE MADAM
I TAPPED AT THE DOOR AS AGREED
LUCAS OPENED IT
I FOLLOWED HIM INTO
HIS ROOM LEAVING THE HALL DOOR AJAR BEHIND ME FOR I FEARED TO BE ALONE
WITH THE MAN
I REMEMBER THAT THERE WAS A WOMAN OUTSIDE AS I ENTERED
OUR BUSINESS WAS SOON DONE
HE HAD MY LETTER ON HIS DESK I HANDED HIM
THE DOCUMENT
HE GAVE ME THE LETTER
AT THIS INSTANT THERE WAS A SOUND
AT THE DOOR
THERE WERE STEPS IN THE PASSAGE
LUCAS QUICKLY TURNED
BACK THE DRUGGET THRUST THE DOCUMENT INTO SOME HIDING PLACE THERE AND
COVERED IT OVER
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT IS LIKE SOME FEARFUL DREAM
I HAVE A VISION OF
A DARK FRANTIC FACE OF A WOMAN'S VOICE WHICH SCREAMED IN FRENCH 'MY
WAITING IS NOT IN VAIN
AT LAST AT LAST I HAVE FOUND YOU WITH HER
THERE WAS A SAVAGE STRUGGLE
I SAW HIM WITH A CHAIR IN HIS HAND A KNIFE
GLEAMED IN HERS
I RUSHED FROM THE HORRIBLE SCENE RAN FROM THE HOUSE
AND ONLY NEXT MORNING IN THE PAPER DID I LEARN THE DREADFUL RESULT
THAT
NIGHT I WAS HAPPY FOR I HAD MY LETTER AND I HAD NOT SEEN YET WHAT THE
FUTURE WOULD BRING
IT WAS THE NEXT MORNING THAT I REALIZED THAT I HAD ONLY EXCHANGED ONE
TROUBLE FOR ANOTHER
MY HUSBAND'S ANGUISH AT THE LOSS OF HIS PAPER WENT
TO MY HEART
I COULD HARDLY PREVENT MYSELF FROM THERE AND THEN KNEELING
DOWN AT HIS FEET AND TELLING HIM WHAT I HAD DONE
BUT THAT AGAIN WOULD
MEAN A CONFESSION OF THE PAST
I CAME TO YOU THAT MORNING IN ORDER TO
UNDERSTAND THE FULL ENORMITY OF MY OFFENCE
FROM THE INSTANT THAT I
GRASPED IT MY WHOLE MIND WAS TURNED TO THE ONE THOUGHT OF GETTING BACK
MY HUSBAND'S PAPER
IT MUST STILL BE WHERE LUCAS HAD PLACED IT FOR IT
WAS CONCEALED BEFORE THIS DREADFUL WOMAN ENTERED THE ROOM
IF IT HAD NOT
BEEN FOR HER COMING I SHOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN WHERE HIS HIDING PLACE WAS
HOW WAS I TO GET INTO THE ROOM FOR TWO DAYS I WATCHED THE PLACE BUT
THE DOOR WAS NEVER LEFT OPEN
LAST NIGHT I MADE A LAST ATTEMPT
WHAT I
DID AND HOW I SUCCEEDED YOU HAVE ALREADY LEARNED
I BROUGHT THE PAPER
BACK WITH ME AND THOUGHT OF DESTROYING IT SINCE I COULD SEE NO WAY OF
RETURNING IT WITHOUT CONFESSING MY GUILT TO MY HUSBAND
HEAVENS I HEAR
HIS STEP UPON THE STAIR
THE EUROPEAN SECRETARY BURST EXCITEDLY INTO THE ROOM
ANY NEWS MR
HOLMES ANY NEWS HE CRIED
I HAVE SOME HOPES
AH THANK HEAVEN HIS FACE BECAME RADIANT
THE PRIME MINISTER IS
LUNCHING WITH ME
MAY HE SHARE YOUR HOPES HE HAS NERVES OF STEEL AND
YET I KNOW THAT HE HAS HARDLY SLEPT SINCE THIS TERRIBLE EVENT
JACOBS
WILL YOU ASK THE PRIME MINISTER TO COME UP AS TO YOU DEAR I FEAR THAT
THIS IS A MATTER OF POLITICS
WE WILL JOIN YOU IN A FEW MINUTES IN THE
DINING ROOM
THE PRIME MINISTER'S MANNER WAS SUBDUED BUT I COULD SEE BY THE GLEAM
OF HIS EYES AND THE TWITCHINGS OF HIS BONY HANDS THAT HE SHARED THE
EXCITEMENT OF HIS YOUNG COLLEAGUE
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT MR
HOLMES
PURELY NEGATIVE AS YET MY FRIEND ANSWERED
I HAVE INQUIRED AT EVERY
POINT WHERE IT MIGHT BE AND I AM SURE THAT THERE IS NO DANGER TO BE
APPREHENDED
BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH MR
HOLMES
WE CANNOT LIVE FOREVER ON SUCH A
VOLCANO
WE MUST HAVE SOMETHING DEFINITE
I AM IN HOPES OF GETTING IT
THAT IS WHY I AM HERE
THE MORE I THINK OF
THE MATTER THE MORE CONVINCED I AM THAT THE LETTER HAS NEVER LEFT THIS
HOUSE
MR
HOLMES
IF IT HAD IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN PUBLIC BY NOW
BUT WHY SHOULD ANYONE TAKE IT IN ORDER TO KEEP IT IN HIS HOUSE
I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT ANYONE DID TAKE IT
THEN HOW COULD IT LEAVE THE DESPATCH BOX
I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT IT EVER DID LEAVE THE DESPATCH BOX
MR
HOLMES THIS JOKING IS VERY ILL TIMED
YOU HAVE MY ASSURANCE THAT
IT LEFT THE BOX
HAVE YOU EXAMINED THE BOX SINCE TUESDAY MORNING
NO
IT WAS NOT NECESSARY
YOU MAY CONCEIVABLY HAVE OVERLOOKED IT
IMPOSSIBLE I SAY
BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED OF IT
I HAVE KNOWN SUCH THINGS TO HAPPEN
I
PRESUME THERE ARE OTHER PAPERS THERE
WELL IT MAY HAVE GOT MIXED WITH
THEM
IT WAS ON THE TOP
SOMEONE MAY HAVE SHAKEN THE BOX AND DISPLACED IT
NO NO I HAD EVERYTHING OUT
SURELY IT IS EASILY DECIDED HOPE SAID THE PREMIER
LET US HAVE THE
DESPATCH BOX BROUGHT IN
THE SECRETARY RANG THE BELL
JACOBS BRING DOWN MY DESPATCH BOX
THIS IS A FARCICAL WASTE OF TIME
BUT STILL IF NOTHING ELSE WILL SATISFY YOU IT SHALL BE DONE
THANK
YOU JACOBS PUT IT HERE
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE KEY ON MY WATCH CHAIN
HERE ARE THE PAPERS YOU SEE
LETTER FROM LORD MERROW REPORT FROM SIR
CHARLES HARDY MEMORANDUM FROM BELGRADE NOTE ON THE RUSSO GERMAN GRAIN
TAXES LETTER FROM MADRID NOTE FROM LORD FLOWERS GOOD HEAVENS WHAT
IS THIS LORD BELLINGER LORD BELLINGER
THE PREMIER SNATCHED THE BLUE ENVELOPE FROM HIS HAND
YES IT IS IT AND THE LETTER IS INTACT
HOPE I CONGRATULATE YOU
THANK YOU THANK YOU WHAT A WEIGHT FROM MY HEART
BUT THIS IS
INCONCEIVABLE IMPOSSIBLE
MR
HOLMES YOU ARE A WIZARD A SORCERER HOW
DID YOU KNOW IT WAS THERE
BECAUSE I KNEW IT WAS NOWHERE ELSE
I CANNOT BELIEVE MY EYES HE RAN WILDLY TO THE DOOR
WHERE IS MY
WIFE I MUST TELL HER THAT ALL IS WELL
HILDA HILDA WE HEARD HIS
VOICE ON THE STAIRS
THE PREMIER LOOKED AT HOLMES WITH TWINKLING EYES
COME SIR SAID HE
THERE IS MORE IN THIS THAN MEETS THE EYE
HOW
CAME THE LETTER BACK IN THE BOX
HOLMES TURNED AWAY SMILING FROM THE KEEN SCRUTINY OF THOSE WONDERFUL
EYES
WE ALSO HAVE OUR DIPLOMATIC SECRETS SAID HE AND PICKING UP HIS HAT
HE TURNED TO THE DOOR

ADVENTURE I
A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
I
TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN
I HAVE SELDOM HEARD
HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME
IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES
AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX
IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT
ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER
ALL EMOTIONS AND THAT
ONE PARTICULARLY WERE ABHORRENT TO HIS COLD PRECISE BUT
ADMIRABLY BALANCED MIND
HE WAS I TAKE IT THE MOST PERFECT
REASONING AND OBSERVING MACHINE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN BUT AS A
LOVER HE WOULD HAVE PLACED HIMSELF IN A FALSE POSITION
HE NEVER
SPOKE OF THE SOFTER PASSIONS SAVE WITH A GIBE AND A SNEER
THEY
WERE ADMIRABLE THINGS FOR THE OBSERVER EXCELLENT FOR DRAWING THE
VEIL FROM MEN'S MOTIVES AND ACTIONS
BUT FOR THE TRAINED REASONER
TO ADMIT SUCH INTRUSIONS INTO HIS OWN DELICATE AND FINELY
ADJUSTED TEMPERAMENT WAS TO INTRODUCE A DISTRACTING FACTOR WHICH
MIGHT THROW A DOUBT UPON ALL HIS MENTAL RESULTS
GRIT IN A
SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT OR A CRACK IN ONE OF HIS OWN HIGH POWER
LENSES WOULD NOT BE MORE DISTURBING THAN A STRONG EMOTION IN A
NATURE SUCH AS HIS
AND YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM AND
THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE
MEMORY
I HAD SEEN LITTLE OF HOLMES LATELY
MY MARRIAGE HAD DRIFTED US
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER
MY OWN COMPLETE HAPPINESS AND THE
HOME CENTRED INTERESTS WHICH RISE UP AROUND THE MAN WHO FIRST
FINDS HIMSELF MASTER OF HIS OWN ESTABLISHMENT WERE SUFFICIENT TO
ABSORB ALL MY ATTENTION WHILE HOLMES WHO LOATHED EVERY FORM OF
SOCIETY WITH HIS WHOLE BOHEMIAN SOUL REMAINED IN OUR LODGINGS IN
BAKER STREET BURIED AMONG HIS OLD BOOKS AND ALTERNATING FROM
WEEK TO WEEK BETWEEN COCAINE AND AMBITION THE DROWSINESS OF THE
DRUG AND THE FIERCE ENERGY OF HIS OWN KEEN NATURE
HE WAS STILL
AS EVER DEEPLY ATTRACTED BY THE STUDY OF CRIME AND OCCUPIED HIS
IMMENSE FACULTIES AND EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF OBSERVATION IN
FOLLOWING OUT THOSE CLUES AND CLEARING UP THOSE MYSTERIES WHICH
HAD BEEN ABANDONED AS HOPELESS BY THE OFFICIAL POLICE
FROM TIME
TO TIME I HEARD SOME VAGUE ACCOUNT OF HIS DOINGS OF HIS SUMMONS
TO ODESSA IN THE CASE OF THE TREPOFF MURDER OF HIS CLEARING UP
OF THE SINGULAR TRAGEDY OF THE ATKINSON BROTHERS AT TRINCOMALEE
AND FINALLY OF THE MISSION WHICH HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED SO
DELICATELY AND SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE REIGNING FAMILY OF HOLLAND
BEYOND THESE SIGNS OF HIS ACTIVITY HOWEVER WHICH I MERELY
SHARED WITH ALL THE READERS OF THE DAILY PRESS I KNEW LITTLE OF
MY FORMER FRIEND AND COMPANION
ONE NIGHT IT WAS ON THE TWENTIETH OF MARCH 1888 I WAS
RETURNING FROM A JOURNEY TO A PATIENT FOR I HAD NOW RETURNED TO
CIVIL PRACTICE WHEN MY WAY LED ME THROUGH BAKER STREET
AS I
PASSED THE WELL REMEMBERED DOOR WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE ASSOCIATED
IN MY MIND WITH MY WOOING AND WITH THE DARK INCIDENTS OF THE
STUDY IN SCARLET I WAS SEIZED WITH A KEEN DESIRE TO SEE HOLMES
AGAIN AND TO KNOW HOW HE WAS EMPLOYING HIS EXTRAORDINARY POWERS
HIS ROOMS WERE BRILLIANTLY LIT AND EVEN AS I LOOKED UP I SAW
HIS TALL SPARE FIGURE PASS TWICE IN A DARK SILHOUETTE AGAINST
THE BLIND
HE WAS PACING THE ROOM SWIFTLY EAGERLY WITH HIS HEAD
SUNK UPON HIS CHEST AND HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIM
TO ME WHO
KNEW HIS EVERY MOOD AND HABIT HIS ATTITUDE AND MANNER TOLD THEIR
OWN STORY
HE WAS AT WORK AGAIN
HE HAD RISEN OUT OF HIS
DRUG CREATED DREAMS AND WAS HOT UPON THE SCENT OF SOME NEW
PROBLEM
I RANG THE BELL AND WAS SHOWN UP TO THE CHAMBER WHICH
HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN PART MY OWN
HIS MANNER WAS NOT EFFUSIVE
IT SELDOM WAS BUT HE WAS GLAD I
THINK TO SEE ME
WITH HARDLY A WORD SPOKEN BUT WITH A KINDLY
EYE HE WAVED ME TO AN ARMCHAIR THREW ACROSS HIS CASE OF CIGARS
AND INDICATED A SPIRIT CASE AND A GASOGENE IN THE CORNER
THEN HE
STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE AND LOOKED ME OVER IN HIS SINGULAR
INTROSPECTIVE FASHION
WEDLOCK SUITS YOU HE REMARKED
I THINK WATSON THAT YOU HAVE
PUT ON SEVEN AND A HALF POUNDS SINCE I SAW YOU
SEVEN I ANSWERED
INDEED I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE
JUST A TRIFLE MORE
I FANCY WATSON
AND IN PRACTICE AGAIN I OBSERVE
YOU DID NOT
TELL ME THAT YOU INTENDED TO GO INTO HARNESS
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW
I SEE IT I DEDUCE IT
HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING
YOURSELF VERY WET LATELY AND THAT YOU HAVE A MOST CLUMSY AND
CARELESS SERVANT GIRL
MY DEAR HOLMES SAID I THIS IS TOO MUCH
YOU WOULD CERTAINLY
HAVE BEEN BURNED HAD YOU LIVED A FEW CENTURIES AGO
IT IS TRUE
THAT I HAD A COUNTRY WALK ON THURSDAY AND CAME HOME IN A DREADFUL
MESS BUT AS I HAVE CHANGED MY CLOTHES I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW YOU
DEDUCE IT
AS TO MARY JANE SHE IS INCORRIGIBLE AND MY WIFE HAS
GIVEN HER NOTICE BUT THERE AGAIN I FAIL TO SEE HOW YOU WORK IT
OUT
HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AND RUBBED HIS LONG NERVOUS HANDS
TOGETHER
IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF SAID HE MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE
INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT
THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS
OBVIOUSLY THEY
HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND
THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT
HENCE YOU SEE MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE
WEATHER AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT SLITTING
SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY
AS TO YOUR PRACTICE IF A
GENTLEMAN WALKS INTO MY ROOMS SMELLING OF IODOFORM WITH A BLACK
MARK OF NITRATE OF SILVER UPON HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER AND A BULGE
ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS TOP HAT TO SHOW WHERE HE HAS SECRETED
HIS STETHOSCOPE I MUST BE DULL INDEED IF I DO NOT PRONOUNCE
HIM TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE EASE WITH WHICH HE EXPLAINED HIS
PROCESS OF DEDUCTION
WHEN I HEAR YOU GIVE YOUR REASONS I
REMARKED THE THING ALWAYS APPEARS TO ME TO BE SO RIDICULOUSLY
SIMPLE THAT I COULD EASILY DO IT MYSELF THOUGH AT EACH
SUCCESSIVE INSTANCE OF YOUR REASONING I AM BAFFLED UNTIL YOU
EXPLAIN YOUR PROCESS
AND YET I BELIEVE THAT MY EYES ARE AS GOOD
AS YOURS
QUITE SO HE ANSWERED LIGHTING A CIGARETTE AND THROWING
HIMSELF DOWN INTO AN ARMCHAIR
YOU SEE BUT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE
THE DISTINCTION IS CLEAR
FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN
THE STEPS WHICH LEAD UP FROM THE HALL TO THIS ROOM
FREQUENTLY
HOW OFTEN
WELL SOME HUNDREDS OF TIMES
THEN HOW MANY ARE THERE
HOW MANY I DON'T KNOW
QUITE SO YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED
AND YET YOU HAVE SEEN
THAT IS
JUST MY POINT
NOW I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVENTEEN STEPS
BECAUSE I HAVE BOTH SEEN AND OBSERVED
BY THE WAY SINCE YOU ARE
INTERESTED IN THESE LITTLE PROBLEMS AND SINCE YOU ARE GOOD
ENOUGH TO CHRONICLE ONE OR TWO OF MY TRIFLING EXPERIENCES YOU
MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS HE THREW OVER A SHEET OF THICK
PINK TINTED NOTE PAPER WHICH HAD BEEN LYING OPEN UPON THE TABLE
IT CAME BY THE LAST POST SAID HE
READ IT ALOUD
THE NOTE WAS UNDATED AND WITHOUT EITHER SIGNATURE OR ADDRESS
THERE WILL CALL UPON YOU TO NIGHT AT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
O'CLOCK IT SAID A GENTLEMAN WHO DESIRES TO CONSULT YOU UPON A
MATTER OF THE VERY DEEPEST MOMENT
YOUR RECENT SERVICES TO ONE OF
THE ROYAL HOUSES OF EUROPE HAVE SHOWN THAT YOU ARE ONE WHO MAY
SAFELY BE TRUSTED WITH MATTERS WHICH ARE OF AN IMPORTANCE WHICH
CAN HARDLY BE EXAGGERATED
THIS ACCOUNT OF YOU WE HAVE FROM ALL
QUARTERS RECEIVED
BE IN YOUR CHAMBER THEN AT THAT HOUR AND DO
NOT TAKE IT AMISS IF YOUR VISITOR WEAR A MASK
THIS IS INDEED A MYSTERY I REMARKED
WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT
IT MEANS
I HAVE NO DATA YET
IT IS A CAPITAL MISTAKE TO THEORIZE BEFORE
ONE HAS DATA
INSENSIBLY ONE BEGINS TO TWIST FACTS TO SUIT
THEORIES INSTEAD OF THEORIES TO SUIT FACTS
BUT THE NOTE ITSELF
WHAT DO YOU DEDUCE FROM IT
I CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE WRITING AND THE PAPER UPON WHICH IT WAS
WRITTEN
THE MAN WHO WROTE IT WAS PRESUMABLY WELL TO DO I REMARKED
ENDEAVOURING TO IMITATE MY COMPANION'S PROCESSES
SUCH PAPER
COULD NOT BE BOUGHT UNDER HALF A CROWN A PACKET
IT IS PECULIARLY
STRONG AND STIFF
PECULIAR THAT IS THE VERY WORD SAID HOLMES
IT IS NOT AN
ENGLISH PAPER AT ALL
HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT
I DID SO AND SAW A LARGE E WITH A SMALL G A P AND A
LARGE G WITH A SMALL T WOVEN INTO THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT ASKED HOLMES
THE NAME OF THE MAKER NO DOUBT OR HIS MONOGRAM RATHER
NOT AT ALL
THE 'G' WITH THE SMALL 'T' STANDS FOR
'GESELLSCHAFT WHICH IS THE GERMAN FOR 'COMPANY IT IS A
CUSTOMARY CONTRACTION LIKE OUR 'CO 'P OF COURSE STANDS FOR
'PAPIER NOW FOR THE 'EG LET US GLANCE AT OUR CONTINENTAL
GAZETTEER HE TOOK DOWN A HEAVY BROWN VOLUME FROM HIS SHELVES
EGLOW EGLONITZ HERE WE ARE EGRIA
IT IS IN A GERMAN SPEAKING
COUNTRY IN BOHEMIA NOT FAR FROM CARLSBAD
'REMARKABLE AS BEING
THE SCENE OF THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN AND FOR ITS NUMEROUS
GLASS FACTORIES AND PAPER MILLS HA HA MY BOY WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THAT HIS EYES SPARKLED AND HE SENT UP A GREAT BLUE
TRIUMPHANT CLOUD FROM HIS CIGARETTE
THE PAPER WAS MADE IN BOHEMIA I SAID
PRECISELY
AND THE MAN WHO WROTE THE NOTE IS A GERMAN
DO YOU
NOTE THE PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENTENCE 'THIS ACCOUNT OF
YOU WE HAVE FROM ALL QUARTERS RECEIVED A FRENCHMAN OR RUSSIAN
COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN THAT
IT IS THE GERMAN WHO IS SO
UNCOURTEOUS TO HIS VERBS
IT ONLY REMAINS THEREFORE TO DISCOVER
WHAT IS WANTED BY THIS GERMAN WHO WRITES UPON BOHEMIAN PAPER AND
PREFERS WEARING A MASK TO SHOWING HIS FACE
AND HERE HE COMES IF
I AM NOT MISTAKEN TO RESOLVE ALL OUR DOUBTS
AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS THE SHARP SOUND OF HORSES' HOOFS AND
GRATING WHEELS AGAINST THE CURB FOLLOWED BY A SHARP PULL AT THE
BELL
HOLMES WHISTLED
A PAIR BY THE SOUND SAID HE
YES HE CONTINUED GLANCING
OUT OF THE WINDOW
A NICE LITTLE BROUGHAM AND A PAIR OF
BEAUTIES
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY GUINEAS APIECE
THERE'S MONEY IN
THIS CASE WATSON IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE
I THINK THAT I HAD BETTER GO HOLMES
NOT A BIT DOCTOR
STAY WHERE YOU ARE
I AM LOST WITHOUT MY
BOSWELL
AND THIS PROMISES TO BE INTERESTING
IT WOULD BE A PITY
TO MISS IT
BUT YOUR CLIENT
NEVER MIND HIM
I MAY WANT YOUR HELP AND SO MAY HE
HERE HE
COMES
SIT DOWN IN THAT ARMCHAIR DOCTOR AND GIVE US YOUR BEST
ATTENTION
A SLOW AND HEAVY STEP WHICH HAD BEEN HEARD UPON THE STAIRS AND
IN THE PASSAGE PAUSED IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE DOOR
THEN THERE
WAS A LOUD AND AUTHORITATIVE TAP
COME IN SAID HOLMES
A MAN ENTERED WHO COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN SIX FEET SIX
INCHES IN HEIGHT WITH THE CHEST AND LIMBS OF A HERCULES
HIS
DRESS WAS RICH WITH A RICHNESS WHICH WOULD IN ENGLAND BE LOOKED
UPON AS AKIN TO BAD TASTE
HEAVY BANDS OF ASTRAKHAN WERE SLASHED
ACROSS THE SLEEVES AND FRONTS OF HIS DOUBLE BREASTED COAT WHILE
THE DEEP BLUE CLOAK WHICH WAS THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS WAS LINED
WITH FLAME COLOURED SILK AND SECURED AT THE NECK WITH A BROOCH
WHICH CONSISTED OF A SINGLE FLAMING BERYL
BOOTS WHICH EXTENDED
HALFWAY UP HIS CALVES AND WHICH WERE TRIMMED AT THE TOPS WITH
RICH BROWN FUR COMPLETED THE IMPRESSION OF BARBARIC OPULENCE
WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE
HE CARRIED A
BROAD BRIMMED HAT IN HIS HAND WHILE HE WORE ACROSS THE UPPER
PART OF HIS FACE EXTENDING DOWN PAST THE CHEEKBONES A BLACK
VIZARD MASK WHICH HE HAD APPARENTLY ADJUSTED THAT VERY MOMENT
FOR HIS HAND WAS STILL RAISED TO IT AS HE ENTERED
FROM THE LOWER
PART OF THE FACE HE APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF STRONG CHARACTER
WITH A THICK HANGING LIP AND A LONG STRAIGHT CHIN SUGGESTIVE
OF RESOLUTION PUSHED TO THE LENGTH OF OBSTINACY
YOU HAD MY NOTE HE ASKED WITH A DEEP HARSH VOICE AND A
STRONGLY MARKED GERMAN ACCENT
I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD CALL HE
LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US AS IF UNCERTAIN WHICH TO
ADDRESS
PRAY TAKE A SEAT SAID HOLMES
THIS IS MY FRIEND AND
COLLEAGUE DR
WATSON WHO IS OCCASIONALLY GOOD ENOUGH TO HELP ME
IN MY CASES
WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR TO ADDRESS
YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS THE COUNT VON KRAMM A BOHEMIAN NOBLEMAN
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS GENTLEMAN YOUR FRIEND IS A MAN OF HONOUR
AND DISCRETION WHOM I MAY TRUST WITH A MATTER OF THE MOST
EXTREME IMPORTANCE
IF NOT I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO COMMUNICATE
WITH YOU ALONE
I ROSE TO GO BUT HOLMES CAUGHT ME BY THE WRIST AND PUSHED ME
BACK INTO MY CHAIR
IT IS BOTH OR NONE SAID HE
YOU MAY SAY
BEFORE THIS GENTLEMAN ANYTHING WHICH YOU MAY SAY TO ME
THE COUNT SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
THEN I MUST BEGIN SAID
HE BY BINDING YOU BOTH TO ABSOLUTE SECRECY FOR TWO YEARS AT
THE END OF THAT TIME THE MATTER WILL BE OF NO IMPORTANCE
AT
PRESENT IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT IT IS OF SUCH WEIGHT IT
MAY HAVE AN INFLUENCE UPON EUROPEAN HISTORY
I PROMISE SAID HOLMES
AND I
YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS MASK CONTINUED OUR STRANGE VISITOR
THE
AUGUST PERSON WHO EMPLOYS ME WISHES HIS AGENT TO BE UNKNOWN TO
YOU AND I MAY CONFESS AT ONCE THAT THE TITLE BY WHICH I HAVE
JUST CALLED MYSELF IS NOT EXACTLY MY OWN
I WAS AWARE OF IT SAID HOLMES DRYLY
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE OF GREAT DELICACY AND EVERY PRECAUTION
HAS TO BE TAKEN TO QUENCH WHAT MIGHT GROW TO BE AN IMMENSE
SCANDAL AND SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE ONE OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF
EUROPE
TO SPEAK PLAINLY THE MATTER IMPLICATES THE GREAT HOUSE
OF ORMSTEIN HEREDITARY KINGS OF BOHEMIA
I WAS ALSO AWARE OF THAT MURMURED HOLMES SETTLING HIMSELF
DOWN IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND CLOSING HIS EYES
OUR VISITOR GLANCED WITH SOME APPARENT SURPRISE AT THE LANGUID
LOUNGING FIGURE OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN NO DOUBT DEPICTED TO HIM
AS THE MOST INCISIVE REASONER AND MOST ENERGETIC AGENT IN EUROPE
HOLMES SLOWLY REOPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT HIS
GIGANTIC CLIENT
IF YOUR MAJESTY WOULD CONDESCEND TO STATE YOUR CASE HE
REMARKED I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ADVISE YOU
THE MAN SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN
UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION
THEN WITH A GESTURE OF DESPERATION HE
TORE THE MASK FROM HIS FACE AND HURLED IT UPON THE GROUND
YOU
ARE RIGHT HE CRIED I AM THE KING
WHY SHOULD I ATTEMPT TO
CONCEAL IT
WHY INDEED MURMURED HOLMES
YOUR MAJESTY HAD NOT SPOKEN
BEFORE I WAS AWARE THAT I WAS ADDRESSING WILHELM GOTTSREICH
SIGISMOND VON ORMSTEIN GRAND DUKE OF CASSEL FELSTEIN AND
HEREDITARY KING OF BOHEMIA
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SAID OUR STRANGE VISITOR SITTING DOWN
ONCE MORE AND PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS HIGH WHITE FOREHEAD YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DOING SUCH BUSINESS IN
MY OWN PERSON
YET THE MATTER WAS SO DELICATE THAT I COULD NOT
CONFIDE IT TO AN AGENT WITHOUT PUTTING MYSELF IN HIS POWER
I
HAVE COME INCOGNITO FROM PRAGUE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSULTING
YOU
THEN PRAY CONSULT SAID HOLMES SHUTTING HIS EYES ONCE MORE
THE FACTS ARE BRIEFLY THESE SOME FIVE YEARS AGO DURING A
LENGTHY VISIT TO WARSAW I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE WELL KNOWN
ADVENTURESS IRENE ADLER
THE NAME IS NO DOUBT FAMILIAR TO YOU
KINDLY LOOK HER UP IN MY INDEX DOCTOR MURMURED HOLMES WITHOUT
OPENING HIS EYES
FOR MANY YEARS HE HAD ADOPTED A SYSTEM OF
DOCKETING ALL PARAGRAPHS CONCERNING MEN AND THINGS SO THAT IT
WAS DIFFICULT TO NAME A SUBJECT OR A PERSON ON WHICH HE COULD NOT
AT ONCE FURNISH INFORMATION
IN THIS CASE I FOUND HER BIOGRAPHY
SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN THAT OF A HEBREW RABBI AND THAT OF A
STAFF COMMANDER WHO HAD WRITTEN A MONOGRAPH UPON THE DEEP SEA
FISHES
LET ME SEE SAID HOLMES
HUM BORN IN NEW JERSEY IN THE YEAR
1858
CONTRALTO HUM LA SCALA HUM PRIMA DONNA IMPERIAL OPERA
OF WARSAW YES RETIRED FROM OPERATIC STAGE HA LIVING IN
LONDON QUITE SO YOUR MAJESTY AS I UNDERSTAND BECAME ENTANGLED
WITH THIS YOUNG PERSON WROTE HER SOME COMPROMISING LETTERS AND
IS NOW DESIROUS OF GETTING THOSE LETTERS BACK
PRECISELY SO
BUT HOW
WAS THERE A SECRET MARRIAGE
NONE
NO LEGAL PAPERS OR CERTIFICATES
NONE
THEN I FAIL TO FOLLOW YOUR MAJESTY
IF THIS YOUNG PERSON SHOULD
PRODUCE HER LETTERS FOR BLACKMAILING OR OTHER PURPOSES HOW IS
SHE TO PROVE THEIR AUTHENTICITY
THERE IS THE WRITING
POOH POOH FORGERY
MY PRIVATE NOTE PAPER
STOLEN
MY OWN SEAL
IMITATED
MY PHOTOGRAPH
BOUGHT
WE WERE BOTH IN THE PHOTOGRAPH
OH DEAR THAT IS VERY BAD YOUR MAJESTY HAS INDEED COMMITTED AN
INDISCRETION
I WAS MAD INSANE
YOU HAVE COMPROMISED YOURSELF SERIOUSLY
I WAS ONLY CROWN PRINCE THEN
I WAS YOUNG
I AM BUT THIRTY NOW
IT MUST BE RECOVERED
WE HAVE TRIED AND FAILED
YOUR MAJESTY MUST PAY
IT MUST BE BOUGHT
SHE WILL NOT SELL
STOLEN THEN
FIVE ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE
TWICE BURGLARS IN MY PAY RANSACKED
HER HOUSE
ONCE WE DIVERTED HER LUGGAGE WHEN SHE TRAVELLED
TWICE
SHE HAS BEEN WAYLAID
THERE HAS BEEN NO RESULT
NO SIGN OF IT
ABSOLUTELY NONE
HOLMES LAUGHED
IT IS QUITE A PRETTY LITTLE PROBLEM SAID HE
BUT A VERY SERIOUS ONE TO ME RETURNED THE KING REPROACHFULLY
VERY INDEED
AND WHAT DOES SHE PROPOSE TO DO WITH THE
PHOTOGRAPH
TO RUIN ME
BUT HOW
I AM ABOUT TO BE MARRIED
SO I HAVE HEARD
TO CLOTILDE LOTHMAN VON SAXE MENINGEN SECOND DAUGHTER OF THE
KING OF SCANDINAVIA
YOU MAY KNOW THE STRICT PRINCIPLES OF HER
FAMILY
SHE IS HERSELF THE VERY SOUL OF DELICACY
A SHADOW OF A
DOUBT AS TO MY CONDUCT WOULD BRING THE MATTER TO AN END
AND IRENE ADLER
THREATENS TO SEND THEM THE PHOTOGRAPH
AND SHE WILL DO IT
I
KNOW THAT SHE WILL DO IT
YOU DO NOT KNOW HER BUT SHE HAS A SOUL
OF STEEL
SHE HAS THE FACE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WOMEN AND
THE MIND OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF MEN
RATHER THAN I SHOULD MARRY
ANOTHER WOMAN THERE ARE NO LENGTHS TO WHICH SHE WOULD NOT
GO NONE
YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE HAS NOT SENT IT YET
I AM SURE
AND WHY
BECAUSE SHE HAS SAID THAT SHE WOULD SEND IT ON THE DAY WHEN THE
BETROTHAL WAS PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED
THAT WILL BE NEXT MONDAY
OH THEN WE HAVE THREE DAYS YET SAID HOLMES WITH A YAWN
THAT
IS VERY FORTUNATE AS I HAVE ONE OR TWO MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO
LOOK INTO JUST AT PRESENT
YOUR MAJESTY WILL OF COURSE STAY IN
LONDON FOR THE PRESENT
CERTAINLY
YOU WILL FIND ME AT THE LANGHAM UNDER THE NAME OF THE
COUNT VON KRAMM
THEN I SHALL DROP YOU A LINE TO LET YOU KNOW HOW WE PROGRESS
PRAY DO SO
I SHALL BE ALL ANXIETY
THEN AS TO MONEY
YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE
ABSOLUTELY
I TELL YOU THAT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF MY KINGDOM
TO HAVE THAT PHOTOGRAPH
AND FOR PRESENT EXPENSES
THE KING TOOK A HEAVY CHAMOIS LEATHER BAG FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK
AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE
THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN GOLD AND SEVEN HUNDRED IN
NOTES HE SAID
HOLMES SCRIBBLED A RECEIPT UPON A SHEET OF HIS NOTE BOOK AND
HANDED IT TO HIM
AND MADEMOISELLE'S ADDRESS HE ASKED
IS BRIONY LODGE SERPENTINE AVENUE ST
JOHN'S WOOD
HOLMES TOOK A NOTE OF IT
ONE OTHER QUESTION SAID HE
WAS THE
PHOTOGRAPH A CABINET
IT WAS
THEN GOOD NIGHT YOUR MAJESTY AND I TRUST THAT WE SHALL SOON
HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU
AND GOOD NIGHT WATSON HE ADDED
AS THE WHEELS OF THE ROYAL BROUGHAM ROLLED DOWN THE STREET
IF
YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL TO MORROW AFTERNOON AT THREE
O'CLOCK I SHOULD LIKE TO CHAT THIS LITTLE MATTER OVER WITH YOU
II
AT THREE O'CLOCK PRECISELY I WAS AT BAKER STREET BUT HOLMES HAD
NOT YET RETURNED
THE LANDLADY INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD LEFT THE
HOUSE SHORTLY AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
I SAT DOWN
BESIDE THE FIRE HOWEVER WITH THE INTENTION OF AWAITING HIM
HOWEVER LONG HE MIGHT BE
I WAS ALREADY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN HIS
INQUIRY FOR THOUGH IT WAS SURROUNDED BY NONE OF THE GRIM AND
STRANGE FEATURES WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO CRIMES WHICH
I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED STILL THE NATURE OF THE CASE AND THE
EXALTED STATION OF HIS CLIENT GAVE IT A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN
INDEED APART FROM THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION WHICH MY
FRIEND HAD ON HAND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS MASTERLY GRASP OF
A SITUATION AND HIS KEEN INCISIVE REASONING WHICH MADE IT A
PLEASURE TO ME TO STUDY HIS SYSTEM OF WORK AND TO FOLLOW THE
QUICK SUBTLE METHODS BY WHICH HE DISENTANGLED THE MOST
INEXTRICABLE MYSTERIES
SO ACCUSTOMED WAS I TO HIS INVARIABLE
SUCCESS THAT THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF HIS FAILING HAD CEASED TO
ENTER INTO MY HEAD
IT WAS CLOSE UPON FOUR BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED AND A
DRUNKEN LOOKING GROOM ILL KEMPT AND SIDE WHISKERED WITH AN
INFLAMED FACE AND DISREPUTABLE CLOTHES WALKED INTO THE ROOM
ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO MY FRIEND'S AMAZING POWERS IN THE USE OF
DISGUISES I HAD TO LOOK THREE TIMES BEFORE I WAS CERTAIN THAT IT
WAS INDEED HE
WITH A NOD HE VANISHED INTO THE BEDROOM WHENCE HE
EMERGED IN FIVE MINUTES TWEED SUITED AND RESPECTABLE AS OF OLD
PUTTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS HE STRETCHED OUT HIS LEGS IN
FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LAUGHED HEARTILY FOR SOME MINUTES
WELL REALLY HE CRIED AND THEN HE CHOKED AND LAUGHED AGAIN
UNTIL HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE BACK LIMP AND HELPLESS IN THE
CHAIR
WHAT IS IT
IT'S QUITE TOO FUNNY
I AM SURE YOU COULD NEVER GUESS HOW I
EMPLOYED MY MORNING OR WHAT I ENDED BY DOING
I CAN'T IMAGINE
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE
HABITS AND PERHAPS THE HOUSE OF MISS IRENE ADLER
QUITE SO BUT THE SEQUEL WAS RATHER UNUSUAL
I WILL TELL YOU
HOWEVER
I LEFT THE HOUSE A LITTLE AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK THIS
MORNING IN THE CHARACTER OF A GROOM OUT OF WORK
THERE IS A
WONDERFUL SYMPATHY AND FREEMASONRY AMONG HORSEY MEN
BE ONE OF
THEM AND YOU WILL KNOW ALL THAT THERE IS TO KNOW
I SOON FOUND
BRIONY LODGE
IT IS A BIJOU VILLA WITH A GARDEN AT THE BACK BUT
BUILT OUT IN FRONT RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD TWO STORIES
CHUBB LOCK
TO THE DOOR
LARGE SITTING ROOM ON THE RIGHT SIDE WELL
FURNISHED WITH LONG WINDOWS ALMOST TO THE FLOOR AND THOSE
PREPOSTEROUS ENGLISH WINDOW FASTENERS WHICH A CHILD COULD OPEN
BEHIND THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE SAVE THAT THE PASSAGE WINDOW
COULD BE REACHED FROM THE TOP OF THE COACH HOUSE
I WALKED ROUND
IT AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW BUT WITHOUT
NOTING ANYTHING ELSE OF INTEREST
I THEN LOUNGED DOWN THE STREET AND FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT
THERE WAS A MEWS IN A LANE WHICH RUNS DOWN BY ONE WALL OF THE
GARDEN
I LENT THE OSTLERS A HAND IN RUBBING DOWN THEIR HORSES
AND RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE TWOPENCE A GLASS OF HALF AND HALF TWO
FILLS OF SHAG TOBACCO AND AS MUCH INFORMATION AS I COULD DESIRE
ABOUT MISS ADLER TO SAY NOTHING OF HALF A DOZEN OTHER PEOPLE IN
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN WHOM I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST INTERESTED BUT
WHOSE BIOGRAPHIES I WAS COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO
AND WHAT OF IRENE ADLER I ASKED
OH SHE HAS TURNED ALL THE MEN'S HEADS DOWN IN THAT PART
SHE IS
THE DAINTIEST THING UNDER A BONNET ON THIS PLANET
SO SAY THE
SERPENTINE MEWS TO A MAN
SHE LIVES QUIETLY SINGS AT CONCERTS
DRIVES OUT AT FIVE EVERY DAY AND RETURNS AT SEVEN SHARP FOR
DINNER
SELDOM GOES OUT AT OTHER TIMES EXCEPT WHEN SHE SINGS
HAS ONLY ONE MALE VISITOR BUT A GOOD DEAL OF HIM
HE IS DARK
HANDSOME AND DASHING NEVER CALLS LESS THAN ONCE A DAY AND
OFTEN TWICE
HE IS A MR
GODFREY NORTON OF THE INNER TEMPLE
SEE
THE ADVANTAGES OF A CABMAN AS A CONFIDANT
THEY HAD DRIVEN HIM
HOME A DOZEN TIMES FROM SERPENTINE MEWS AND KNEW ALL ABOUT HIM
WHEN I HAD LISTENED TO ALL THEY HAD TO TELL I BEGAN TO WALK UP
AND DOWN NEAR BRIONY LODGE ONCE MORE AND TO THINK OVER MY PLAN
OF CAMPAIGN
THIS GODFREY NORTON WAS EVIDENTLY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE
MATTER
HE WAS A LAWYER
THAT SOUNDED OMINOUS
WHAT WAS THE
RELATION BETWEEN THEM AND WHAT THE OBJECT OF HIS REPEATED
VISITS WAS SHE HIS CLIENT HIS FRIEND OR HIS MISTRESS IF THE
FORMER SHE HAD PROBABLY TRANSFERRED THE PHOTOGRAPH TO HIS
KEEPING
IF THE LATTER IT WAS LESS LIKELY
ON THE ISSUE OF THIS
QUESTION DEPENDED WHETHER I SHOULD CONTINUE MY WORK AT BRIONY
LODGE OR TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE GENTLEMAN'S CHAMBERS IN THE
TEMPLE
IT WAS A DELICATE POINT AND IT WIDENED THE FIELD OF MY
INQUIRY
I FEAR THAT I BORE YOU WITH THESE DETAILS BUT I HAVE TO
LET YOU SEE MY LITTLE DIFFICULTIES IF YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THE
SITUATION
I AM FOLLOWING YOU CLOSELY I ANSWERED
I WAS STILL BALANCING THE MATTER IN MY MIND WHEN A HANSOM CAB
DROVE UP TO BRIONY LODGE AND A GENTLEMAN SPRANG OUT
HE WAS A
REMARKABLY HANDSOME MAN DARK AQUILINE AND MOUSTACHED EVIDENTLY
THE MAN OF WHOM I HAD HEARD
HE APPEARED TO BE IN A
GREAT HURRY SHOUTED TO THE CABMAN TO WAIT AND BRUSHED PAST THE
MAID WHO OPENED THE DOOR WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO WAS THOROUGHLY
AT HOME
HE WAS IN THE HOUSE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND I COULD CATCH
GLIMPSES OF HIM IN THE WINDOWS OF THE SITTING ROOM PACING UP AND
DOWN TALKING EXCITEDLY AND WAVING HIS ARMS
OF HER I COULD SEE
NOTHING
PRESENTLY HE EMERGED LOOKING EVEN MORE FLURRIED THAN
BEFORE
AS HE STEPPED UP TO THE CAB HE PULLED A GOLD WATCH FROM
HIS POCKET AND LOOKED AT IT EARNESTLY 'DRIVE LIKE THE DEVIL HE
SHOUTED 'FIRST TO GROSS HANKEY'S IN REGENT STREET AND THEN TO
THE CHURCH OF ST
MONICA IN THE EDGEWARE ROAD
HALF A GUINEA IF
YOU DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
AWAY THEY WENT AND I WAS JUST WONDERING WHETHER I SHOULD NOT DO
WELL TO FOLLOW THEM WHEN UP THE LANE CAME A NEAT LITTLE LANDAU
THE COACHMAN WITH HIS COAT ONLY HALF BUTTONED AND HIS TIE UNDER
HIS EAR WHILE ALL THE TAGS OF HIS HARNESS WERE STICKING OUT OF
THE BUCKLES
IT HADN'T PULLED UP BEFORE SHE SHOT OUT OF THE HALL
DOOR AND INTO IT
I ONLY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER AT THE MOMENT
BUT SHE WAS A LOVELY WOMAN WITH A FACE THAT A MAN MIGHT DIE FOR
'THE CHURCH OF ST
MONICA JOHN SHE CRIED 'AND HALF A
SOVEREIGN IF YOU REACH IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
THIS WAS QUITE TOO GOOD TO LOSE WATSON
I WAS JUST BALANCING
WHETHER I SHOULD RUN FOR IT OR WHETHER I SHOULD PERCH BEHIND HER
LANDAU WHEN A CAB CAME THROUGH THE STREET
THE DRIVER LOOKED
TWICE AT SUCH A SHABBY FARE BUT I JUMPED IN BEFORE HE COULD
OBJECT
'THE CHURCH OF ST
MONICA SAID I 'AND HALF A SOVEREIGN
IF YOU REACH IT IN TWENTY MINUTES IT WAS TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO
TWELVE AND OF COURSE IT WAS CLEAR ENOUGH WHAT WAS IN THE WIND
MY CABBY DROVE FAST
I DON'T THINK I EVER DROVE FASTER BUT THE
OTHERS WERE THERE BEFORE US
THE CAB AND THE LANDAU WITH THEIR
STEAMING HORSES WERE IN FRONT OF THE DOOR WHEN I ARRIVED
I PAID
THE MAN AND HURRIED INTO THE CHURCH
THERE WAS NOT A SOUL THERE
SAVE THE TWO WHOM I HAD FOLLOWED AND A SURPLICED CLERGYMAN WHO
SEEMED TO BE EXPOSTULATING WITH THEM
THEY WERE ALL THREE
STANDING IN A KNOT IN FRONT OF THE ALTAR
I LOUNGED UP THE SIDE
AISLE LIKE ANY OTHER IDLER WHO HAS DROPPED INTO A CHURCH
SUDDENLY TO MY SURPRISE THE THREE AT THE ALTAR FACED ROUND TO
ME AND GODFREY NORTON CAME RUNNING AS HARD AS HE COULD TOWARDS
ME
'THANK GOD HE CRIED
'YOU'LL DO
COME COME
'WHAT THEN I ASKED
'COME MAN COME ONLY THREE MINUTES OR IT WON'T BE LEGAL
I WAS HALF DRAGGED UP TO THE ALTAR AND BEFORE I KNEW WHERE I WAS
I FOUND MYSELF MUMBLING RESPONSES WHICH WERE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
AND VOUCHING FOR THINGS OF WHICH I KNEW NOTHING AND GENERALLY
ASSISTING IN THE SECURE TYING UP OF IRENE ADLER SPINSTER TO
GODFREY NORTON BACHELOR
IT WAS ALL DONE IN AN INSTANT AND
THERE WAS THE GENTLEMAN THANKING ME ON THE ONE SIDE AND THE LADY
ON THE OTHER WHILE THE CLERGYMAN BEAMED ON ME IN FRONT
IT WAS
THE MOST PREPOSTEROUS POSITION IN WHICH I EVER FOUND MYSELF IN MY
LIFE AND IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF IT THAT STARTED ME LAUGHING JUST
NOW
IT SEEMS THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME INFORMALITY ABOUT THEIR
LICENSE THAT THE CLERGYMAN ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO MARRY THEM
WITHOUT A WITNESS OF SOME SORT AND THAT MY LUCKY APPEARANCE
SAVED THE BRIDEGROOM FROM HAVING TO SALLY OUT INTO THE STREETS IN
SEARCH OF A BEST MAN
THE BRIDE GAVE ME A SOVEREIGN AND I MEAN
TO WEAR IT ON MY WATCH CHAIN IN MEMORY OF THE OCCASION
THIS IS A VERY UNEXPECTED TURN OF AFFAIRS SAID I AND WHAT
THEN
WELL I FOUND MY PLANS VERY SERIOUSLY MENACED
IT LOOKED AS IF
THE PAIR MIGHT TAKE AN IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE AND SO NECESSITATE
VERY PROMPT AND ENERGETIC MEASURES ON MY PART
AT THE CHURCH
DOOR HOWEVER THEY SEPARATED HE DRIVING BACK TO THE TEMPLE AND
SHE TO HER OWN HOUSE
'I SHALL DRIVE OUT IN THE PARK AT FIVE AS
USUAL SHE SAID AS SHE LEFT HIM
I HEARD NO MORE
THEY DROVE
AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND I WENT OFF TO MAKE MY OWN
ARRANGEMENTS
WHICH ARE
SOME COLD BEEF AND A GLASS OF BEER HE ANSWERED RINGING THE
BELL
I HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY TO THINK OF FOOD AND I AM LIKELY TO
BE BUSIER STILL THIS EVENING
BY THE WAY DOCTOR I SHALL WANT
YOUR CO OPERATION
I SHALL BE DELIGHTED
YOU DON'T MIND BREAKING THE LAW
NOT IN THE LEAST
NOR RUNNING A CHANCE OF ARREST
NOT IN A GOOD CAUSE
OH THE CAUSE IS EXCELLENT
THEN I AM YOUR MAN
I WAS SURE THAT I MIGHT RELY ON YOU
BUT WHAT IS IT YOU WISH
WHEN MRS
TURNER HAS BROUGHT IN THE TRAY I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR TO
YOU
NOW HE SAID AS HE TURNED HUNGRILY ON THE SIMPLE FARE THAT
OUR LANDLADY HAD PROVIDED I MUST DISCUSS IT WHILE I EAT FOR I
HAVE NOT MUCH TIME
IT IS NEARLY FIVE NOW
IN TWO HOURS WE MUST
BE ON THE SCENE OF ACTION
MISS IRENE OR MADAME RATHER RETURNS
FROM HER DRIVE AT SEVEN
WE MUST BE AT BRIONY LODGE TO MEET HER
AND WHAT THEN
YOU MUST LEAVE THAT TO ME
I HAVE ALREADY ARRANGED WHAT IS TO
OCCUR
THERE IS ONLY ONE POINT ON WHICH I MUST INSIST
YOU MUST
NOT INTERFERE COME WHAT MAY
YOU UNDERSTAND
I AM TO BE NEUTRAL
TO DO NOTHING WHATEVER
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOME SMALL
UNPLEASANTNESS
DO NOT JOIN IN IT
IT WILL END IN MY BEING
CONVEYED INTO THE HOUSE
FOUR OR FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE
SITTING ROOM WINDOW WILL OPEN
YOU ARE TO STATION YOURSELF CLOSE
TO THAT OPEN WINDOW
YES
YOU ARE TO WATCH ME FOR I WILL BE VISIBLE TO YOU
YES
AND WHEN I RAISE MY HAND SO YOU WILL THROW INTO THE ROOM WHAT
I GIVE YOU TO THROW AND WILL AT THE SAME TIME RAISE THE CRY OF
FIRE
YOU QUITE FOLLOW ME
ENTIRELY
IT IS NOTHING VERY FORMIDABLE HE SAID TAKING A LONG CIGAR SHAPED
ROLL FROM HIS POCKET
IT IS AN ORDINARY PLUMBER'S SMOKE ROCKET
FITTED WITH A CAP AT EITHER END TO MAKE IT SELF LIGHTING
YOUR TASK IS CONFINED TO THAT
WHEN YOU RAISE YOUR CRY OF FIRE
IT WILL BE TAKEN UP BY QUITE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
YOU MAY THEN
WALK TO THE END OF THE STREET AND I WILL REJOIN YOU IN TEN
MINUTES
I HOPE THAT I HAVE MADE MYSELF CLEAR
I AM TO REMAIN NEUTRAL TO GET NEAR THE WINDOW TO WATCH YOU
AND AT THE SIGNAL TO THROW IN THIS OBJECT THEN TO RAISE THE CRY
OF FIRE AND TO WAIT YOU AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET
PRECISELY
THEN YOU MAY ENTIRELY RELY ON ME
THAT IS EXCELLENT
I THINK PERHAPS IT IS ALMOST TIME THAT I
PREPARE FOR THE NEW ROLE I HAVE TO PLAY
HE DISAPPEARED INTO HIS BEDROOM AND RETURNED IN A FEW MINUTES IN
THE CHARACTER OF AN AMIABLE AND SIMPLE MINDED NONCONFORMIST
CLERGYMAN
HIS BROAD BLACK HAT HIS BAGGY TROUSERS HIS WHITE
TIE HIS SYMPATHETIC SMILE AND GENERAL LOOK OF PEERING AND
BENEVOLENT CURIOSITY WERE SUCH AS MR
JOHN HARE ALONE COULD HAVE
EQUALLED
IT WAS NOT MERELY THAT HOLMES CHANGED HIS COSTUME
HIS
EXPRESSION HIS MANNER HIS VERY SOUL SEEMED TO VARY WITH EVERY
FRESH PART THAT HE ASSUMED
THE STAGE LOST A FINE ACTOR EVEN AS
SCIENCE LOST AN ACUTE REASONER WHEN HE BECAME A SPECIALIST IN
CRIME
IT WAS A QUARTER PAST SIX WHEN WE LEFT BAKER STREET AND IT STILL
WANTED TEN MINUTES TO THE HOUR WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN
SERPENTINE AVENUE
IT WAS ALREADY DUSK AND THE LAMPS WERE JUST
BEING LIGHTED AS WE PACED UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF BRIONY LODGE
WAITING FOR THE COMING OF ITS OCCUPANT
THE HOUSE WAS JUST SUCH
AS I HAD PICTURED IT FROM SHERLOCK HOLMES' SUCCINCT DESCRIPTION
BUT THE LOCALITY APPEARED TO BE LESS PRIVATE THAN I EXPECTED
ON
THE CONTRARY FOR A SMALL STREET IN A QUIET NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS
REMARKABLY ANIMATED
THERE WAS A GROUP OF SHABBILY DRESSED MEN
SMOKING AND LAUGHING IN A CORNER A SCISSORS GRINDER WITH HIS
WHEEL TWO GUARDSMEN WHO WERE FLIRTING WITH A NURSE GIRL AND
SEVERAL WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN WHO WERE LOUNGING UP AND DOWN WITH
CIGARS IN THEIR MOUTHS
YOU SEE REMARKED HOLMES AS WE PACED TO AND FRO IN FRONT OF
THE HOUSE THIS MARRIAGE RATHER SIMPLIFIES MATTERS
THE
PHOTOGRAPH BECOMES A DOUBLE EDGED WEAPON NOW
THE CHANCES ARE
THAT SHE WOULD BE AS AVERSE TO ITS BEING SEEN BY MR
GODFREY
NORTON AS OUR CLIENT IS TO ITS COMING TO THE EYES OF HIS
PRINCESS
NOW THE QUESTION IS WHERE ARE WE TO FIND THE
PHOTOGRAPH
WHERE INDEED
IT IS MOST UNLIKELY THAT SHE CARRIES IT ABOUT WITH HER
IT IS
CABINET SIZE
TOO LARGE FOR EASY CONCEALMENT ABOUT A WOMAN'S
DRESS
SHE KNOWS THAT THE KING IS CAPABLE OF HAVING HER WAYLAID
AND SEARCHED
TWO ATTEMPTS OF THE SORT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE
WE
MAY TAKE IT THEN THAT SHE DOES NOT CARRY IT ABOUT WITH HER
WHERE THEN
HER BANKER OR HER LAWYER
THERE IS THAT DOUBLE POSSIBILITY
BUT
I AM INCLINED TO THINK NEITHER
WOMEN ARE NATURALLY SECRETIVE
AND THEY LIKE TO DO THEIR OWN SECRETING
WHY SHOULD SHE HAND IT
OVER TO ANYONE ELSE SHE COULD TRUST HER OWN GUARDIANSHIP BUT
SHE COULD NOT TELL WHAT INDIRECT OR POLITICAL INFLUENCE MIGHT BE
BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON A BUSINESS MAN
BESIDES REMEMBER THAT SHE
HAD RESOLVED TO USE IT WITHIN A FEW DAYS
IT MUST BE WHERE SHE
CAN LAY HER HANDS UPON IT
IT MUST BE IN HER OWN HOUSE
BUT IT HAS TWICE BEEN BURGLED
PSHAW THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO LOOK
BUT HOW WILL YOU LOOK
I WILL NOT LOOK
WHAT THEN
I WILL GET HER TO SHOW ME
BUT SHE WILL REFUSE
SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
BUT I HEAR THE RUMBLE OF WHEELS
IT IS
HER CARRIAGE
NOW CARRY OUT MY ORDERS TO THE LETTER
AS HE SPOKE THE GLEAM OF THE SIDE LIGHTS OF A CARRIAGE CAME ROUND
THE CURVE OF THE AVENUE
IT WAS A SMART LITTLE LANDAU WHICH
RATTLED UP TO THE DOOR OF BRIONY LODGE
AS IT PULLED UP ONE OF
THE LOAFING MEN AT THE CORNER DASHED FORWARD TO OPEN THE DOOR IN
THE HOPE OF EARNING A COPPER BUT WAS ELBOWED AWAY BY ANOTHER
LOAFER WHO HAD RUSHED UP WITH THE SAME INTENTION
A FIERCE
QUARREL BROKE OUT WHICH WAS INCREASED BY THE TWO GUARDSMEN WHO
TOOK SIDES WITH ONE OF THE LOUNGERS AND BY THE SCISSORS GRINDER
WHO WAS EQUALLY HOT UPON THE OTHER SIDE
A BLOW WAS STRUCK AND
IN AN INSTANT THE LADY WHO HAD STEPPED FROM HER CARRIAGE WAS
THE CENTRE OF A LITTLE KNOT OF FLUSHED AND STRUGGLING MEN WHO
STRUCK SAVAGELY AT EACH OTHER WITH THEIR FISTS AND STICKS
HOLMES
DASHED INTO THE CROWD TO PROTECT THE LADY BUT JUST AS HE REACHED
HER HE GAVE A CRY AND DROPPED TO THE GROUND WITH THE BLOOD
RUNNING FREELY DOWN HIS FACE
AT HIS FALL THE GUARDSMEN TOOK TO
THEIR HEELS IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE LOUNGERS IN THE OTHER WHILE
A NUMBER OF BETTER DRESSED PEOPLE WHO HAD WATCHED THE SCUFFLE
WITHOUT TAKING PART IN IT CROWDED IN TO HELP THE LADY AND TO
ATTEND TO THE INJURED MAN
IRENE ADLER AS I WILL STILL CALL HER
HAD HURRIED UP THE STEPS BUT SHE STOOD AT THE TOP WITH HER
SUPERB FIGURE OUTLINED AGAINST THE LIGHTS OF THE HALL LOOKING
BACK INTO THE STREET
IS THE POOR GENTLEMAN MUCH HURT SHE ASKED
HE IS DEAD CRIED SEVERAL VOICES
NO NO THERE'S LIFE IN HIM SHOUTED ANOTHER
BUT HE'LL BE
GONE BEFORE YOU CAN GET HIM TO HOSPITAL
HE'S A BRAVE FELLOW SAID A WOMAN
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THE
LADY'S PURSE AND WATCH IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HIM
THEY WERE A
GANG AND A ROUGH ONE TOO
AH HE'S BREATHING NOW
HE CAN'T LIE IN THE STREET
MAY WE BRING HIM IN MARM
SURELY
BRING HIM INTO THE SITTING ROOM
THERE IS A COMFORTABLE
SOFA
THIS WAY PLEASE
SLOWLY AND SOLEMNLY HE WAS BORNE INTO BRIONY LODGE AND LAID OUT
IN THE PRINCIPAL ROOM WHILE I STILL OBSERVED THE PROCEEDINGS
FROM MY POST BY THE WINDOW
THE LAMPS HAD BEEN LIT BUT THE
BLINDS HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN SO THAT I COULD SEE HOLMES AS HE LAY
UPON THE COUCH
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS SEIZED WITH
COMPUNCTION AT THAT MOMENT FOR THE PART HE WAS PLAYING BUT I
KNOW THAT I NEVER FELT MORE HEARTILY ASHAMED OF MYSELF IN MY LIFE
THAN WHEN I SAW THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE AGAINST WHOM I WAS
CONSPIRING OR THE GRACE AND KINDLINESS WITH WHICH SHE WAITED
UPON THE INJURED MAN
AND YET IT WOULD BE THE BLACKEST TREACHERY
TO HOLMES TO DRAW BACK NOW FROM THE PART WHICH HE HAD INTRUSTED
TO ME
I HARDENED MY HEART AND TOOK THE SMOKE ROCKET FROM UNDER
MY ULSTER
AFTER ALL I THOUGHT WE ARE NOT INJURING HER
WE ARE
BUT PREVENTING HER FROM INJURING ANOTHER
HOLMES HAD SAT UP UPON THE COUCH AND I SAW HIM MOTION LIKE A MAN
WHO IS IN NEED OF AIR
A MAID RUSHED ACROSS AND THREW OPEN THE
WINDOW
AT THE SAME INSTANT I SAW HIM RAISE HIS HAND AND AT THE
SIGNAL I TOSSED MY ROCKET INTO THE ROOM WITH A CRY OF FIRE THE
WORD WAS NO SOONER OUT OF MY MOUTH THAN THE WHOLE CROWD OF
SPECTATORS WELL DRESSED AND ILL GENTLEMEN OSTLERS AND
SERVANT MAIDS JOINED IN A GENERAL SHRIEK OF FIRE THICK CLOUDS
OF SMOKE CURLED THROUGH THE ROOM AND OUT AT THE OPEN WINDOW
I
CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF RUSHING FIGURES AND A MOMENT LATER THE VOICE
OF HOLMES FROM WITHIN ASSURING THEM THAT IT WAS A FALSE ALARM
SLIPPING THROUGH THE SHOUTING CROWD I MADE MY WAY TO THE CORNER
OF THE STREET AND IN TEN MINUTES WAS REJOICED TO FIND MY
FRIEND'S ARM IN MINE AND TO GET AWAY FROM THE SCENE OF UPROAR
HE WALKED SWIFTLY AND IN SILENCE FOR SOME FEW MINUTES UNTIL WE
HAD TURNED DOWN ONE OF THE QUIET STREETS WHICH LEAD TOWARDS THE
EDGEWARE ROAD
YOU DID IT VERY NICELY DOCTOR HE REMARKED
NOTHING COULD
HAVE BEEN BETTER
IT IS ALL RIGHT
YOU HAVE THE PHOTOGRAPH
I KNOW WHERE IT IS
AND HOW DID YOU FIND OUT
SHE SHOWED ME AS I TOLD YOU SHE WOULD
I AM STILL IN THE DARK
I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE A MYSTERY SAID HE LAUGHING
THE MATTER
WAS PERFECTLY SIMPLE
YOU OF COURSE SAW THAT EVERYONE IN THE
STREET WAS AN ACCOMPLICE
THEY WERE ALL ENGAGED FOR THE EVENING
I GUESSED AS MUCH
THEN WHEN THE ROW BROKE OUT I HAD A LITTLE MOIST RED PAINT IN
THE PALM OF MY HAND
I RUSHED FORWARD FELL DOWN CLAPPED MY HAND
TO MY FACE AND BECAME A PITEOUS SPECTACLE
IT IS AN OLD TRICK
THAT ALSO I COULD FATHOM
THEN THEY CARRIED ME IN
SHE WAS BOUND TO HAVE ME IN
WHAT ELSE
COULD SHE DO AND INTO HER SITTING ROOM WHICH WAS THE VERY ROOM
WHICH I SUSPECTED
IT LAY BETWEEN THAT AND HER BEDROOM AND I WAS
DETERMINED TO SEE WHICH
THEY LAID ME ON A COUCH I MOTIONED FOR
AIR THEY WERE COMPELLED TO OPEN THE WINDOW AND YOU HAD YOUR
CHANCE
HOW DID THAT HELP YOU
IT WAS ALL IMPORTANT
WHEN A WOMAN THINKS THAT HER HOUSE IS ON
FIRE HER INSTINCT IS AT ONCE TO RUSH TO THE THING WHICH SHE
VALUES MOST
IT IS A PERFECTLY OVERPOWERING IMPULSE AND I HAVE
MORE THAN ONCE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IT
IN THE CASE OF THE
DARLINGTON SUBSTITUTION SCANDAL IT WAS OF USE TO ME AND ALSO IN
THE ARNSWORTH CASTLE BUSINESS
A MARRIED WOMAN GRABS AT HER BABY
AN UNMARRIED ONE REACHES FOR HER JEWEL BOX
NOW IT WAS CLEAR TO
ME THAT OUR LADY OF TO DAY HAD NOTHING IN THE HOUSE MORE PRECIOUS
TO HER THAN WHAT WE ARE IN QUEST OF
SHE WOULD RUSH TO SECURE IT
THE ALARM OF FIRE WAS ADMIRABLY DONE
THE SMOKE AND SHOUTING WERE
ENOUGH TO SHAKE NERVES OF STEEL
SHE RESPONDED BEAUTIFULLY
THE
PHOTOGRAPH IS IN A RECESS BEHIND A SLIDING PANEL JUST ABOVE THE
RIGHT BELL PULL
SHE WAS THERE IN AN INSTANT AND I CAUGHT A
GLIMPSE OF IT AS SHE HALF DREW IT OUT
WHEN I CRIED OUT THAT IT
WAS A FALSE ALARM SHE REPLACED IT GLANCED AT THE ROCKET RUSHED
FROM THE ROOM AND I HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE
I ROSE AND MAKING
MY EXCUSES ESCAPED FROM THE HOUSE
I HESITATED WHETHER TO
ATTEMPT TO SECURE THE PHOTOGRAPH AT ONCE BUT THE COACHMAN HAD
COME IN AND AS HE WAS WATCHING ME NARROWLY IT SEEMED SAFER TO
WAIT
A LITTLE OVER PRECIPITANCE MAY RUIN ALL
AND NOW I ASKED
OUR QUEST IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED
I SHALL CALL WITH THE KING
TO MORROW AND WITH YOU IF YOU CARE TO COME WITH US
WE WILL BE
SHOWN INTO THE SITTING ROOM TO WAIT FOR THE LADY BUT IT IS
PROBABLE THAT WHEN SHE COMES SHE MAY FIND NEITHER US NOR THE
PHOTOGRAPH
IT MIGHT BE A SATISFACTION TO HIS MAJESTY TO REGAIN
IT WITH HIS OWN HANDS
AND WHEN WILL YOU CALL
AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING
SHE WILL NOT BE UP SO THAT WE SHALL
HAVE A CLEAR FIELD
BESIDES WE MUST BE PROMPT FOR THIS MARRIAGE
MAY MEAN A COMPLETE CHANGE IN HER LIFE AND HABITS
I MUST WIRE TO
THE KING WITHOUT DELAY
WE HAD REACHED BAKER STREET AND HAD STOPPED AT THE DOOR
HE WAS
SEARCHING HIS POCKETS FOR THE KEY WHEN SOMEONE PASSING SAID
GOOD NIGHT MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES
THERE WERE SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THE PAVEMENT AT THE TIME BUT THE
GREETING APPEARED TO COME FROM A SLIM YOUTH IN AN ULSTER WHO HAD
HURRIED BY
I'VE HEARD THAT VOICE BEFORE SAID HOLMES STARING DOWN THE
DIMLY LIT STREET
NOW I WONDER WHO THE DEUCE THAT COULD HAVE
BEEN
III
I SLEPT AT BAKER STREET THAT NIGHT AND WE WERE ENGAGED UPON OUR
TOAST AND COFFEE IN THE MORNING WHEN THE KING OF BOHEMIA RUSHED
INTO THE ROOM
YOU HAVE REALLY GOT IT HE CRIED GRASPING SHERLOCK HOLMES BY
EITHER SHOULDER AND LOOKING EAGERLY INTO HIS FACE
NOT YET
BUT YOU HAVE HOPES
I HAVE HOPES
THEN COME
I AM ALL IMPATIENCE TO BE GONE
WE MUST HAVE A CAB
NO MY BROUGHAM IS WAITING
THEN THAT WILL SIMPLIFY MATTERS WE DESCENDED AND STARTED OFF
ONCE MORE FOR BRIONY LODGE
IRENE ADLER IS MARRIED REMARKED HOLMES
MARRIED WHEN
YESTERDAY
BUT TO WHOM
TO AN ENGLISH LAWYER NAMED NORTON
BUT SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM
I AM IN HOPES THAT SHE DOES
AND WHY IN HOPES
BECAUSE IT WOULD SPARE YOUR MAJESTY ALL FEAR OF FUTURE
ANNOYANCE
IF THE LADY LOVES HER HUSBAND SHE DOES NOT LOVE YOUR
MAJESTY
IF SHE DOES NOT LOVE YOUR MAJESTY THERE IS NO REASON
WHY SHE SHOULD INTERFERE WITH YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN
IT IS TRUE
AND YET WELL I WISH SHE HAD BEEN OF MY OWN
STATION WHAT A QUEEN SHE WOULD HAVE MADE HE RELAPSED INTO A
MOODY SILENCE WHICH WAS NOT BROKEN UNTIL WE DREW UP IN
SERPENTINE AVENUE
THE DOOR OF BRIONY LODGE WAS OPEN AND AN ELDERLY WOMAN STOOD
UPON THE STEPS
SHE WATCHED US WITH A SARDONIC EYE AS WE STEPPED
FROM THE BROUGHAM
MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES I BELIEVE SAID SHE
I AM MR
HOLMES ANSWERED MY COMPANION LOOKING AT HER WITH A
QUESTIONING AND RATHER STARTLED GAZE
INDEED MY MISTRESS TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE LIKELY TO CALL
SHE
LEFT THIS MORNING WITH HER HUSBAND BY THE 5 15 TRAIN FROM CHARING
CROSS FOR THE CONTINENT
WHAT SHERLOCK HOLMES STAGGERED BACK WHITE WITH CHAGRIN AND
SURPRISE
DO YOU MEAN THAT SHE HAS LEFT ENGLAND
NEVER TO RETURN
AND THE PAPERS ASKED THE KING HOARSELY
ALL IS LOST
WE SHALL SEE HE PUSHED PAST THE SERVANT AND RUSHED INTO THE
DRAWING ROOM FOLLOWED BY THE KING AND MYSELF
THE FURNITURE WAS
SCATTERED ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION WITH DISMANTLED SHELVES AND
OPEN DRAWERS AS IF THE LADY HAD HURRIEDLY RANSACKED THEM BEFORE
HER FLIGHT
HOLMES RUSHED AT THE BELL PULL TORE BACK A SMALL
SLIDING SHUTTER AND PLUNGING IN HIS HAND PULLED OUT A
PHOTOGRAPH AND A LETTER
THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS OF IRENE ADLER
HERSELF IN EVENING DRESS THE LETTER WAS SUPERSCRIBED TO
SHERLOCK HOLMES ESQ
TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED FOR MY FRIEND
TORE IT OPEN AND WE ALL THREE READ IT TOGETHER
IT WAS DATED AT
MIDNIGHT OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT AND RAN IN THIS WAY
MY DEAR MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES YOU REALLY DID IT VERY WELL
YOU
TOOK ME IN COMPLETELY
UNTIL AFTER THE ALARM OF FIRE I HAD NOT A
SUSPICION
BUT THEN WHEN I FOUND HOW I HAD BETRAYED MYSELF I
BEGAN TO THINK
I HAD BEEN WARNED AGAINST YOU MONTHS AGO
I HAD
BEEN TOLD THAT IF THE KING EMPLOYED AN AGENT IT WOULD CERTAINLY
BE YOU
AND YOUR ADDRESS HAD BEEN GIVEN ME
YET WITH ALL THIS
YOU MADE ME REVEAL WHAT YOU WANTED TO KNOW
EVEN AFTER I BECAME
SUSPICIOUS I FOUND IT HARD TO THINK EVIL OF SUCH A DEAR KIND
OLD CLERGYMAN
BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN TRAINED AS AN ACTRESS
MYSELF
MALE COSTUME IS NOTHING NEW TO ME
I OFTEN TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE FREEDOM WHICH IT GIVES
I SENT JOHN THE COACHMAN TO
WATCH YOU RAN UP STAIRS GOT INTO MY WALKING CLOTHES AS I CALL
THEM AND CAME DOWN JUST AS YOU DEPARTED
WELL I FOLLOWED YOU TO YOUR DOOR AND SO MADE SURE THAT I WAS
REALLY AN OBJECT OF INTEREST TO THE CELEBRATED MR
SHERLOCK
HOLMES
THEN I RATHER IMPRUDENTLY WISHED YOU GOOD NIGHT AND
STARTED FOR THE TEMPLE TO SEE MY HUSBAND
WE BOTH THOUGHT THE BEST RESOURCE WAS FLIGHT WHEN PURSUED BY
SO FORMIDABLE AN ANTAGONIST SO YOU WILL FIND THE NEST EMPTY WHEN
YOU CALL TO MORROW
AS TO THE PHOTOGRAPH YOUR CLIENT MAY REST IN
PEACE
I LOVE AND AM LOVED BY A BETTER MAN THAN HE
THE KING MAY
DO WHAT HE WILL WITHOUT HINDRANCE FROM ONE WHOM HE HAS CRUELLY
WRONGED
I KEEP IT ONLY TO SAFEGUARD MYSELF AND TO PRESERVE A
WEAPON WHICH WILL ALWAYS SECURE ME FROM ANY STEPS WHICH HE MIGHT
TAKE IN THE FUTURE
I LEAVE A PHOTOGRAPH WHICH HE MIGHT CARE TO
POSSESS AND I REMAIN DEAR MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
VERY TRULY YOURS
IRENE NORTON NE ADLER
WHAT A WOMAN OH WHAT A WOMAN CRIED THE KING OF BOHEMIA WHEN
WE HAD ALL THREE READ THIS EPISTLE
DID I NOT TELL YOU HOW QUICK
AND RESOLUTE SHE WAS WOULD SHE NOT HAVE MADE AN ADMIRABLE QUEEN
IS IT NOT A PITY THAT SHE WAS NOT ON MY LEVEL
FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE LADY SHE SEEMS INDEED TO BE ON A
VERY DIFFERENT LEVEL TO YOUR MAJESTY SAID HOLMES COLDLY
I AM
SORRY THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING YOUR MAJESTY'S BUSINESS
TO A MORE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION
ON THE CONTRARY MY DEAR SIR CRIED THE KING NOTHING COULD BE
MORE SUCCESSFUL
I KNOW THAT HER WORD IS INVIOLATE
THE
PHOTOGRAPH IS NOW AS SAFE AS IF IT WERE IN THE FIRE
I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOUR MAJESTY SAY SO
I AM IMMENSELY INDEBTED TO YOU
PRAY TELL ME IN WHAT WAY I CAN
REWARD YOU
THIS RING HE SLIPPED AN EMERALD SNAKE RING FROM
HIS FINGER AND HELD IT OUT UPON THE PALM OF HIS HAND
YOUR MAJESTY HAS SOMETHING WHICH I SHOULD VALUE EVEN MORE
HIGHLY SAID HOLMES
YOU HAVE BUT TO NAME IT
THIS PHOTOGRAPH
THE KING STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT
IRENE'S PHOTOGRAPH HE CRIED
CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT
I THANK YOUR MAJESTY
THEN THERE IS NO MORE TO BE DONE IN THE
MATTER
I HAVE THE HONOUR TO WISH YOU A VERY GOOD MORNING HE
BOWED AND TURNING AWAY WITHOUT OBSERVING THE HAND WHICH THE
KING HAD STRETCHED OUT TO HIM HE SET OFF IN MY COMPANY FOR HIS
CHAMBERS
AND THAT WAS HOW A GREAT SCANDAL THREATENED TO AFFECT THE KINGDOM
OF BOHEMIA AND HOW THE BEST PLANS OF MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES WERE
BEATEN BY A WOMAN'S WIT
HE USED TO MAKE MERRY OVER THE
CLEVERNESS OF WOMEN BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM DO IT OF LATE
AND
WHEN HE SPEAKS OF IRENE ADLER OR WHEN HE REFERS TO HER
PHOTOGRAPH IT IS ALWAYS UNDER THE HONOURABLE TITLE OF THE WOMAN
ADVENTURE II
THE RED HEADED LEAGUE
I HAD CALLED UPON MY FRIEND MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES ONE DAY IN THE
AUTUMN OF LAST YEAR AND FOUND HIM IN DEEP CONVERSATION WITH A
VERY STOUT FLORID FACED ELDERLY GENTLEMAN WITH FIERY RED HAIR
WITH AN APOLOGY FOR MY INTRUSION I WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW WHEN
HOLMES PULLED ME ABRUPTLY INTO THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR
BEHIND ME
YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE COME AT A BETTER TIME MY DEAR
WATSON HE SAID CORDIALLY
I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU WERE ENGAGED
SO I AM
VERY MUCH SO
THEN I CAN WAIT IN THE NEXT ROOM
NOT AT ALL
THIS GENTLEMAN MR
WILSON HAS BEEN MY PARTNER AND
HELPER IN MANY OF MY MOST SUCCESSFUL CASES AND I HAVE NO
DOUBT THAT HE WILL BE OF THE UTMOST USE TO ME IN YOURS ALSO
THE STOUT GENTLEMAN HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GAVE A BOB OF
GREETING WITH A QUICK LITTLE QUESTIONING GLANCE FROM HIS SMALL
FAT ENCIRCLED EYES
TRY THE SETTEE SAID HOLMES RELAPSING INTO HIS ARMCHAIR AND
PUTTING HIS FINGERTIPS TOGETHER AS WAS HIS CUSTOM WHEN IN
JUDICIAL MOODS
I KNOW MY DEAR WATSON THAT YOU SHARE MY LOVE
OF ALL THAT IS BIZARRE AND OUTSIDE THE CONVENTIONS AND HUMDRUM
ROUTINE OF EVERYDAY LIFE
YOU HAVE SHOWN YOUR RELISH FOR IT BY
THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH HAS PROMPTED YOU TO CHRONICLE AND IF YOU
WILL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO SOMEWHAT TO EMBELLISH SO MANY OF MY OWN
LITTLE ADVENTURES
YOUR CASES HAVE INDEED BEEN OF THE GREATEST INTEREST TO ME I
OBSERVED
YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT I REMARKED THE OTHER DAY JUST BEFORE WE
WENT INTO THE VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM PRESENTED BY MISS MARY
SUTHERLAND THAT FOR STRANGE EFFECTS AND EXTRAORDINARY
COMBINATIONS WE MUST GO TO LIFE ITSELF WHICH IS ALWAYS FAR MORE
DARING THAN ANY EFFORT OF THE IMAGINATION
A PROPOSITION WHICH I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF DOUBTING
YOU DID DOCTOR BUT NONE THE LESS YOU MUST COME ROUND TO MY
VIEW FOR OTHERWISE I SHALL KEEP ON PILING FACT UPON FACT ON YOU
UNTIL YOUR REASON BREAKS DOWN UNDER THEM AND ACKNOWLEDGES ME TO
BE RIGHT
NOW MR
JABEZ WILSON HERE HAS BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL
UPON ME THIS MORNING AND TO BEGIN A NARRATIVE WHICH PROMISES TO
BE ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR WHICH I HAVE LISTENED TO FOR SOME
TIME
YOU HAVE HEARD ME REMARK THAT THE STRANGEST AND MOST UNIQUE
THINGS ARE VERY OFTEN CONNECTED NOT WITH THE LARGER BUT WITH THE
SMALLER CRIMES AND OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHERE THERE IS ROOM FOR
DOUBT WHETHER ANY POSITIVE CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED
AS FAR AS I
HAVE HEARD IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY WHETHER THE PRESENT
CASE IS AN INSTANCE OF CRIME OR NOT BUT THE COURSE OF EVENTS IS
CERTAINLY AMONG THE MOST SINGULAR THAT I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO
PERHAPS MR
WILSON YOU WOULD HAVE THE GREAT KINDNESS TO
RECOMMENCE YOUR NARRATIVE
I ASK YOU NOT MERELY BECAUSE MY FRIEND
DR
WATSON HAS NOT HEARD THE OPENING PART BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE
PECULIAR NATURE OF THE STORY MAKES ME ANXIOUS TO HAVE EVERY
POSSIBLE DETAIL FROM YOUR LIPS
AS A RULE WHEN I HAVE HEARD SOME
SLIGHT INDICATION OF THE COURSE OF EVENTS I AM ABLE TO GUIDE
MYSELF BY THE THOUSANDS OF OTHER SIMILAR CASES WHICH OCCUR TO MY
MEMORY
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE I AM FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THE
FACTS ARE TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF UNIQUE
THE PORTLY CLIENT PUFFED OUT HIS CHEST WITH AN APPEARANCE OF SOME
LITTLE PRIDE AND PULLED A DIRTY AND WRINKLED NEWSPAPER FROM THE
INSIDE POCKET OF HIS GREATCOAT
AS HE GLANCED DOWN THE
ADVERTISEMENT COLUMN WITH HIS HEAD THRUST FORWARD AND THE PAPER
FLATTENED OUT UPON HIS KNEE I TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THE MAN AND
ENDEAVOURED AFTER THE FASHION OF MY COMPANION TO READ THE
INDICATIONS WHICH MIGHT BE PRESENTED BY HIS DRESS OR APPEARANCE
I DID NOT GAIN VERY MUCH HOWEVER BY MY INSPECTION
OUR VISITOR
BORE EVERY MARK OF BEING AN AVERAGE COMMONPLACE BRITISH
TRADESMAN OBESE POMPOUS AND SLOW
HE WORE RATHER BAGGY GREY
SHEPHERD'S CHECK TROUSERS A NOT OVER CLEAN BLACK FROCK COAT
UNBUTTONED IN THE FRONT AND A DRAB WAISTCOAT WITH A HEAVY BRASSY
ALBERT CHAIN AND A SQUARE PIERCED BIT OF METAL DANGLING DOWN AS
AN ORNAMENT
A FRAYED TOP HAT AND A FADED BROWN OVERCOAT WITH A
WRINKLED VELVET COLLAR LAY UPON A CHAIR BESIDE HIM
ALTOGETHER
LOOK AS I WOULD THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT THE MAN SAVE
HIS BLAZING RED HEAD AND THE EXPRESSION OF EXTREME CHAGRIN AND
DISCONTENT UPON HIS FEATURES
SHERLOCK HOLMES' QUICK EYE TOOK IN MY OCCUPATION AND HE SHOOK
HIS HEAD WITH A SMILE AS HE NOTICED MY QUESTIONING GLANCES
BEYOND THE OBVIOUS FACTS THAT HE HAS AT SOME TIME DONE MANUAL
LABOUR THAT HE TAKES SNUFF THAT HE IS A FREEMASON THAT HE HAS
BEEN IN CHINA AND THAT HE HAS DONE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
WRITING LATELY I CAN DEDUCE NOTHING ELSE
MR
JABEZ WILSON STARTED UP IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS FOREFINGER
UPON THE PAPER BUT HIS EYES UPON MY COMPANION
HOW IN THE NAME OF GOOD FORTUNE DID YOU KNOW ALL THAT MR
HOLMES HE ASKED
HOW DID YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT I DID
MANUAL LABOUR
IT'S AS TRUE AS GOSPEL FOR I BEGAN AS A SHIP'S
CARPENTER
YOUR HANDS MY DEAR SIR
YOUR RIGHT HAND IS QUITE A SIZE LARGER
THAN YOUR LEFT
YOU HAVE WORKED WITH IT AND THE MUSCLES ARE MORE
DEVELOPED
WELL THE SNUFF THEN AND THE FREEMASONRY
I WON'T INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE BY TELLING YOU HOW I READ THAT
ESPECIALLY AS RATHER AGAINST THE STRICT RULES OF YOUR ORDER YOU
USE AN ARC AND COMPASS BREASTPIN
AH OF COURSE I FORGOT THAT
BUT THE WRITING
WHAT ELSE CAN BE INDICATED BY THAT RIGHT CUFF SO VERY SHINY FOR
FIVE INCHES AND THE LEFT ONE WITH THE SMOOTH PATCH NEAR THE
ELBOW WHERE YOU REST IT UPON THE DESK
WELL BUT CHINA
THE FISH THAT YOU HAVE TATTOOED IMMEDIATELY ABOVE YOUR RIGHT
WRIST COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN DONE IN CHINA
I HAVE MADE A SMALL
STUDY OF TATTOO MARKS AND HAVE EVEN CONTRIBUTED TO THE LITERATURE
OF THE SUBJECT
THAT TRICK OF STAINING THE FISHES' SCALES OF A
DELICATE PINK IS QUITE PECULIAR TO CHINA
WHEN IN ADDITION I
SEE A CHINESE COIN HANGING FROM YOUR WATCH CHAIN THE MATTER
BECOMES EVEN MORE SIMPLE
MR
JABEZ WILSON LAUGHED HEAVILY
WELL I NEVER SAID HE
I
THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT YOU HAD DONE SOMETHING CLEVER BUT I SEE
THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT AFTER ALL
I BEGIN TO THINK WATSON SAID HOLMES THAT I MAKE A MISTAKE
IN EXPLAINING
'OMNE IGNOTUM PRO MAGNIFICO YOU KNOW AND MY
POOR LITTLE REPUTATION SUCH AS IT IS WILL SUFFER SHIPWRECK IF I
AM SO CANDID
CAN YOU NOT FIND THE ADVERTISEMENT MR
WILSON
YES I HAVE GOT IT NOW HE ANSWERED WITH HIS THICK RED FINGER
PLANTED HALFWAY DOWN THE COLUMN
HERE IT IS
THIS IS WHAT BEGAN
IT ALL
YOU JUST READ IT FOR YOURSELF SIR
I TOOK THE PAPER FROM HIM AND READ AS FOLLOWS
TO THE RED HEADED LEAGUE ON ACCOUNT OF THE BEQUEST OF THE LATE
EZEKIAH HOPKINS OF LEBANON PENNSYLVANIA U
S
A THERE IS NOW
ANOTHER VACANCY OPEN WHICH ENTITLES A MEMBER OF THE LEAGUE TO A
SALARY OF 4 POUNDS A WEEK FOR PURELY NOMINAL SERVICES
ALL
RED HEADED MEN WHO ARE SOUND IN BODY AND MIND AND ABOVE THE AGE
OF TWENTY ONE YEARS ARE ELIGIBLE
APPLY IN PERSON ON MONDAY AT
ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO DUNCAN ROSS AT THE OFFICES OF THE LEAGUE 7
POPE'S COURT FLEET STREET
WHAT ON EARTH DOES THIS MEAN I EJACULATED AFTER I HAD TWICE
READ OVER THE EXTRAORDINARY ANNOUNCEMENT
HOLMES CHUCKLED AND WRIGGLED IN HIS CHAIR AS WAS HIS HABIT WHEN
IN HIGH SPIRITS
IT IS A LITTLE OFF THE BEATEN TRACK ISN'T IT
SAID HE
AND NOW MR
WILSON OFF YOU GO AT SCRATCH AND TELL US
ALL ABOUT YOURSELF YOUR HOUSEHOLD AND THE EFFECT WHICH THIS
ADVERTISEMENT HAD UPON YOUR FORTUNES
YOU WILL FIRST MAKE A NOTE
DOCTOR OF THE PAPER AND THE DATE
IT IS THE MORNING CHRONICLE OF APRIL 27 1890
JUST TWO MONTHS
AGO
VERY GOOD
NOW MR
WILSON
WELL IT IS JUST AS I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU MR
SHERLOCK
HOLMES SAID JABEZ WILSON MOPPING HIS FOREHEAD I HAVE A SMALL
PAWNBROKER'S BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE NEAR THE CITY
IT'S NOT A
VERY LARGE AFFAIR AND OF LATE YEARS IT HAS NOT DONE MORE THAN
JUST GIVE ME A LIVING
I USED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP TWO ASSISTANTS
BUT NOW I ONLY KEEP ONE AND I WOULD HAVE A JOB TO PAY HIM BUT
THAT HE IS WILLING TO COME FOR HALF WAGES SO AS TO LEARN THE
BUSINESS
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS OBLIGING YOUTH ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
HIS NAME IS VINCENT SPAULDING AND HE'S NOT SUCH A YOUTH
EITHER
IT'S HARD TO SAY HIS AGE
I SHOULD NOT WISH A SMARTER
ASSISTANT MR
HOLMES AND I KNOW VERY WELL THAT HE COULD BETTER
HIMSELF AND EARN TWICE WHAT I AM ABLE TO GIVE HIM
BUT AFTER
ALL IF HE IS SATISFIED WHY SHOULD I PUT IDEAS IN HIS HEAD
WHY INDEED YOU SEEM MOST FORTUNATE IN HAVING AN EMPLOY WHO
COMES UNDER THE FULL MARKET PRICE
IT IS NOT A COMMON EXPERIENCE
AMONG EMPLOYERS IN THIS AGE
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR ASSISTANT IS
NOT AS REMARKABLE AS YOUR ADVERTISEMENT
OH HE HAS HIS FAULTS TOO SAID MR
WILSON
NEVER WAS SUCH A
FELLOW FOR PHOTOGRAPHY
SNAPPING AWAY WITH A CAMERA WHEN HE OUGHT
TO BE IMPROVING HIS MIND AND THEN DIVING DOWN INTO THE CELLAR
LIKE A RABBIT INTO ITS HOLE TO DEVELOP HIS PICTURES
THAT IS HIS
MAIN FAULT BUT ON THE WHOLE HE'S A GOOD WORKER
THERE'S NO VICE
IN HIM
HE IS STILL WITH YOU I PRESUME
YES SIR
HE AND A GIRL OF FOURTEEN WHO DOES A BIT OF SIMPLE
COOKING AND KEEPS THE PLACE CLEAN THAT'S ALL I HAVE IN THE
HOUSE FOR I AM A WIDOWER AND NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
WE LIVE VERY
QUIETLY SIR THE THREE OF US AND WE KEEP A ROOF OVER OUR HEADS
AND PAY OUR DEBTS IF WE DO NOTHING MORE
THE FIRST THING THAT PUT US OUT WAS THAT ADVERTISEMENT
SPAULDING HE CAME DOWN INTO THE OFFICE JUST THIS DAY EIGHT
WEEKS WITH THIS VERY PAPER IN HIS HAND AND HE SAYS
'I WISH TO THE LORD MR
WILSON THAT I WAS A RED HEADED MAN
'WHY THAT I ASKS
'WHY SAYS HE 'HERE'S ANOTHER VACANCY ON THE LEAGUE OF THE
RED HEADED MEN
IT'S WORTH QUITE A LITTLE FORTUNE TO ANY MAN WHO
GETS IT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MORE VACANCIES THAN
THERE ARE MEN SO THAT THE TRUSTEES ARE AT THEIR WITS' END WHAT
TO DO WITH THE MONEY
IF MY HAIR WOULD ONLY CHANGE COLOUR HERE'S
A NICE LITTLE CRIB ALL READY FOR ME TO STEP INTO
'WHY WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED
YOU SEE MR
HOLMES I AM A
VERY STAY AT HOME MAN AND AS MY BUSINESS CAME TO ME INSTEAD OF
MY HAVING TO GO TO IT I WAS OFTEN WEEKS ON END WITHOUT PUTTING
MY FOOT OVER THE DOOR MAT
IN THAT WAY I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH OF WHAT
WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE AND I WAS ALWAYS GLAD OF A BIT OF NEWS
'HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE LEAGUE OF THE RED HEADED MEN HE
ASKED WITH HIS EYES OPEN
'NEVER
'WHY I WONDER AT THAT FOR YOU ARE ELIGIBLE YOURSELF FOR ONE
OF THE VACANCIES
'AND WHAT ARE THEY WORTH I ASKED
'OH MERELY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED A YEAR BUT THE WORK IS SLIGHT
AND IT NEED NOT INTERFERE VERY MUCH WITH ONE'S OTHER
OCCUPATIONS
WELL YOU CAN EASILY THINK THAT THAT MADE ME PRICK UP MY EARS
FOR THE BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN OVER GOOD FOR SOME YEARS AND AN
EXTRA COUPLE OF HUNDRED WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HANDY
'TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT SAID I
'WELL SAID HE SHOWING ME THE ADVERTISEMENT 'YOU CAN SEE FOR
YOURSELF THAT THE LEAGUE HAS A VACANCY AND THERE IS THE ADDRESS
WHERE YOU SHOULD APPLY FOR PARTICULARS
AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT
THE LEAGUE WAS FOUNDED BY AN AMERICAN MILLIONAIRE EZEKIAH
HOPKINS WHO WAS VERY PECULIAR IN HIS WAYS
HE WAS HIMSELF
RED HEADED AND HE HAD A GREAT SYMPATHY FOR ALL RED HEADED MEN
SO WHEN HE DIED IT WAS FOUND THAT HE HAD LEFT HIS ENORMOUS
FORTUNE IN THE HANDS OF TRUSTEES WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO APPLY THE
INTEREST TO THE PROVIDING OF EASY BERTHS TO MEN WHOSE HAIR IS OF
THAT COLOUR
FROM ALL I HEAR IT IS SPLENDID PAY AND VERY LITTLE TO
DO
'BUT SAID I 'THERE WOULD BE MILLIONS OF RED HEADED MEN WHO
WOULD APPLY
'NOT SO MANY AS YOU MIGHT THINK HE ANSWERED
'YOU SEE IT IS
REALLY CONFINED TO LONDONERS AND TO GROWN MEN
THIS AMERICAN HAD
STARTED FROM LONDON WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AND HE WANTED TO DO THE
OLD TOWN A GOOD TURN
THEN AGAIN I HAVE HEARD IT IS NO USE YOUR
APPLYING IF YOUR HAIR IS LIGHT RED OR DARK RED OR ANYTHING BUT
REAL BRIGHT BLAZING FIERY RED
NOW IF YOU CARED TO APPLY MR
WILSON YOU WOULD JUST WALK IN BUT PERHAPS IT WOULD HARDLY BE
WORTH YOUR WHILE TO PUT YOURSELF OUT OF THE WAY FOR THE SAKE OF A
FEW HUNDRED POUNDS
NOW IT IS A FACT GENTLEMEN AS YOU MAY SEE FOR YOURSELVES
THAT MY HAIR IS OF A VERY FULL AND RICH TINT SO THAT IT SEEMED
TO ME THAT IF THERE WAS TO BE ANY COMPETITION IN THE MATTER I
STOOD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANY MAN THAT I HAD EVER MET
VINCENT
SPAULDING SEEMED TO KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT IT THAT I THOUGHT HE MIGHT
PROVE USEFUL SO I JUST ORDERED HIM TO PUT UP THE SHUTTERS FOR
THE DAY AND TO COME RIGHT AWAY WITH ME
HE WAS VERY WILLING TO
HAVE A HOLIDAY SO WE SHUT THE BUSINESS UP AND STARTED OFF FOR
THE ADDRESS THAT WAS GIVEN US IN THE ADVERTISEMENT
I NEVER HOPE TO SEE SUCH A SIGHT AS THAT AGAIN MR
HOLMES
FROM
NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST EVERY MAN WHO HAD A SHADE OF RED IN
HIS HAIR HAD TRAMPED INTO THE CITY TO ANSWER THE ADVERTISEMENT
FLEET STREET WAS CHOKED WITH RED HEADED FOLK AND POPE'S COURT
LOOKED LIKE A COSTER'S ORANGE BARROW
I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT
THERE WERE SO MANY IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY AS WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER
BY THAT SINGLE ADVERTISEMENT
EVERY SHADE OF COLOUR THEY
WERE STRAW LEMON ORANGE BRICK IRISH SETTER LIVER CLAY
BUT AS SPAULDING SAID THERE WERE NOT MANY WHO HAD THE REAL
VIVID FLAME COLOURED TINT
WHEN I SAW HOW MANY WERE WAITING I
WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT UP IN DESPAIR BUT SPAULDING WOULD NOT HEAR
OF IT
HOW HE DID IT I COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT HE PUSHED AND
PULLED AND BUTTED UNTIL HE GOT ME THROUGH THE CROWD AND RIGHT UP
TO THE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE OFFICE
THERE WAS A DOUBLE STREAM
UPON THE STAIR SOME GOING UP IN HOPE AND SOME COMING BACK
DEJECTED BUT WE WEDGED IN AS WELL AS WE COULD AND SOON FOUND
OURSELVES IN THE OFFICE
YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A MOST ENTERTAINING ONE REMARKED
HOLMES AS HIS CLIENT PAUSED AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY WITH A HUGE
PINCH OF SNUFF
PRAY CONTINUE YOUR VERY INTERESTING STATEMENT
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE OFFICE BUT A COUPLE OF WOODEN CHAIRS
AND A DEAL TABLE BEHIND WHICH SAT A SMALL MAN WITH A HEAD THAT
WAS EVEN REDDER THAN MINE
HE SAID A FEW WORDS TO EACH CANDIDATE
AS HE CAME UP AND THEN HE ALWAYS MANAGED TO FIND SOME FAULT IN
THEM WHICH WOULD DISQUALIFY THEM
GETTING A VACANCY DID NOT SEEM
TO BE SUCH A VERY EASY MATTER AFTER ALL
HOWEVER WHEN OUR TURN
CAME THE LITTLE MAN WAS MUCH MORE FAVOURABLE TO ME THAN TO ANY OF
THE OTHERS AND HE CLOSED THE DOOR AS WE ENTERED SO THAT HE
MIGHT HAVE A PRIVATE WORD WITH US
'THIS IS MR
JABEZ WILSON SAID MY ASSISTANT 'AND HE IS
WILLING TO FILL A VACANCY IN THE LEAGUE
'AND HE IS ADMIRABLY SUITED FOR IT THE OTHER ANSWERED
'HE HAS
EVERY REQUIREMENT
I CANNOT RECALL WHEN I HAVE SEEN ANYTHING SO
FINE HE TOOK A STEP BACKWARD COCKED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND
GAZED AT MY HAIR UNTIL I FELT QUITE BASHFUL
THEN SUDDENLY HE
PLUNGED FORWARD WRUNG MY HAND AND CONGRATULATED ME WARMLY ON MY
SUCCESS
'IT WOULD BE INJUSTICE TO HESITATE SAID HE
'YOU WILL
HOWEVER I AM SURE EXCUSE ME FOR TAKING AN OBVIOUS PRECAUTION
WITH THAT HE SEIZED MY HAIR IN BOTH HIS HANDS AND TUGGED UNTIL I
YELLED WITH THE PAIN
'THERE IS WATER IN YOUR EYES SAID HE AS
HE RELEASED ME
'I PERCEIVE THAT ALL IS AS IT SHOULD BE
BUT WE
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL FOR WE HAVE TWICE BEEN DECEIVED BY WIGS AND
ONCE BY PAINT
I COULD TELL YOU TALES OF COBBLER'S WAX WHICH
WOULD DISGUST YOU WITH HUMAN NATURE HE STEPPED OVER TO THE
WINDOW AND SHOUTED THROUGH IT AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE THAT THE
VACANCY WAS FILLED
A GROAN OF DISAPPOINTMENT CAME UP FROM BELOW
AND THE FOLK ALL TROOPED AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS UNTIL THERE
WAS NOT A RED HEAD TO BE SEEN EXCEPT MY OWN AND THAT OF THE
MANAGER
'MY NAME SAID HE 'IS MR
DUNCAN ROSS AND I AM MYSELF ONE OF
THE PENSIONERS UPON THE FUND LEFT BY OUR NOBLE BENEFACTOR
ARE
YOU A MARRIED MAN MR
WILSON HAVE YOU A FAMILY
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD NOT
HIS FACE FELL IMMEDIATELY
'DEAR ME HE SAID GRAVELY 'THAT IS VERY SERIOUS INDEED I AM
SORRY TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT
THE FUND WAS OF COURSE FOR THE
PROPAGATION AND SPREAD OF THE RED HEADS AS WELL AS FOR THEIR
MAINTENANCE
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE A
BACHELOR
MY FACE LENGTHENED AT THIS MR
HOLMES FOR I THOUGHT THAT I WAS
NOT TO HAVE THE VACANCY AFTER ALL BUT AFTER THINKING IT OVER FOR
A FEW MINUTES HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT
'IN THE CASE OF ANOTHER SAID HE 'THE OBJECTION MIGHT BE
FATAL BUT WE MUST STRETCH A POINT IN FAVOUR OF A MAN WITH SUCH A
HEAD OF HAIR AS YOURS
WHEN SHALL YOU BE ABLE TO ENTER UPON YOUR
NEW DUTIES
'WELL IT IS A LITTLE AWKWARD FOR I HAVE A BUSINESS ALREADY
SAID I
'OH NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT MR
WILSON SAID VINCENT SPAULDING
'I SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AFTER THAT FOR YOU
'WHAT WOULD BE THE HOURS I ASKED
'TEN TO TWO
NOW A PAWNBROKER'S BUSINESS IS MOSTLY DONE OF AN EVENING MR
HOLMES ESPECIALLY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY EVENING WHICH IS JUST
BEFORE PAY DAY SO IT WOULD SUIT ME VERY WELL TO EARN A LITTLE IN
THE MORNINGS
BESIDES I KNEW THAT MY ASSISTANT WAS A GOOD MAN
AND THAT HE WOULD SEE TO ANYTHING THAT TURNED UP
'THAT WOULD SUIT ME VERY WELL SAID I
'AND THE PAY
'IS 4 POUNDS A WEEK
'AND THE WORK
'IS PURELY NOMINAL
'WHAT DO YOU CALL PURELY NOMINAL
'WELL YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE OFFICE OR AT LEAST IN THE
BUILDING THE WHOLE TIME
IF YOU LEAVE YOU FORFEIT YOUR WHOLE
POSITION FOREVER
THE WILL IS VERY CLEAR UPON THAT POINT
YOU
DON'T COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS IF YOU BUDGE FROM THE OFFICE
DURING THAT TIME
'IT'S ONLY FOUR HOURS A DAY AND I SHOULD NOT THINK OF LEAVING
SAID I
'NO EXCUSE WILL AVAIL SAID MR
DUNCAN ROSS 'NEITHER SICKNESS
NOR BUSINESS NOR ANYTHING ELSE
THERE YOU MUST STAY OR YOU LOSE
YOUR BILLET
'AND THE WORK
'IS TO COPY OUT THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA THERE IS THE FIRST
VOLUME OF IT IN THAT PRESS
YOU MUST FIND YOUR OWN INK PENS AND
BLOTTING PAPER BUT WE PROVIDE THIS TABLE AND CHAIR
WILL YOU BE
READY TO MORROW
'CERTAINLY I ANSWERED
'THEN GOOD BYE MR
JABEZ WILSON AND LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU
ONCE MORE ON THE IMPORTANT POSITION WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE
ENOUGH TO GAIN HE BOWED ME OUT OF THE ROOM AND I WENT HOME WITH
MY ASSISTANT HARDLY KNOWING WHAT TO SAY OR DO I WAS SO PLEASED
AT MY OWN GOOD FORTUNE
WELL I THOUGHT OVER THE MATTER ALL DAY AND BY EVENING I WAS IN
LOW SPIRITS AGAIN FOR I HAD QUITE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT THE
WHOLE AFFAIR MUST BE SOME GREAT HOAX OR FRAUD THOUGH WHAT ITS
OBJECT MIGHT BE I COULD NOT IMAGINE
IT SEEMED ALTOGETHER PAST
BELIEF THAT ANYONE COULD MAKE SUCH A WILL OR THAT THEY WOULD PAY
SUCH A SUM FOR DOING ANYTHING SO SIMPLE AS COPYING OUT THE
'ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA VINCENT SPAULDING DID WHAT HE COULD TO
CHEER ME UP BUT BY BEDTIME I HAD REASONED MYSELF OUT OF THE
WHOLE THING
HOWEVER IN THE MORNING I DETERMINED TO HAVE A LOOK
AT IT ANYHOW SO I BOUGHT A PENNY BOTTLE OF INK AND WITH A
QUILL PEN AND SEVEN SHEETS OF FOOLSCAP PAPER I STARTED OFF FOR
POPE'S COURT
WELL TO MY SURPRISE AND DELIGHT EVERYTHING WAS AS RIGHT AS
POSSIBLE
THE TABLE WAS SET OUT READY FOR ME AND MR
DUNCAN ROSS
WAS THERE TO SEE THAT I GOT FAIRLY TO WORK
HE STARTED ME OFF
UPON THE LETTER A AND THEN HE LEFT ME BUT HE WOULD DROP IN FROM
TIME TO TIME TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT WITH ME
AT TWO O'CLOCK HE
BADE ME GOOD DAY COMPLIMENTED ME UPON THE AMOUNT THAT I HAD
WRITTEN AND LOCKED THE DOOR OF THE OFFICE AFTER ME
THIS WENT ON DAY AFTER DAY MR
HOLMES AND ON SATURDAY THE
MANAGER CAME IN AND PLANKED DOWN FOUR GOLDEN SOVEREIGNS FOR MY
WEEK'S WORK
IT WAS THE SAME NEXT WEEK AND THE SAME THE WEEK
AFTER
EVERY MORNING I WAS THERE AT TEN AND EVERY AFTERNOON I
LEFT AT TWO
BY DEGREES MR
DUNCAN ROSS TOOK TO COMING IN ONLY
ONCE OF A MORNING AND THEN AFTER A TIME HE DID NOT COME IN AT
ALL
STILL OF COURSE I NEVER DARED TO LEAVE THE ROOM FOR AN
INSTANT FOR I WAS NOT SURE WHEN HE MIGHT COME AND THE BILLET
WAS SUCH A GOOD ONE AND SUITED ME SO WELL THAT I WOULD NOT RISK
THE LOSS OF IT
EIGHT WEEKS PASSED AWAY LIKE THIS AND I HAD WRITTEN ABOUT
ABBOTS AND ARCHERY AND ARMOUR AND ARCHITECTURE AND ATTICA AND
HOPED WITH DILIGENCE THAT I MIGHT GET ON TO THE B'S BEFORE VERY
LONG
IT COST ME SOMETHING IN FOOLSCAP AND I HAD PRETTY NEARLY
FILLED A SHELF WITH MY WRITINGS
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE
BUSINESS CAME TO AN END
TO AN END
YES SIR
AND NO LATER THAN THIS MORNING
I WENT TO MY WORK AS
USUAL AT TEN O'CLOCK BUT THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED WITH A
LITTLE SQUARE OF CARDBOARD HAMMERED ON TO THE MIDDLE OF THE
PANEL WITH A TACK
HERE IT IS AND YOU CAN READ FOR YOURSELF
HE HELD UP A PIECE OF WHITE CARDBOARD ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHEET
OF NOTE PAPER
IT READ IN THIS FASHION
THE RED HEADED LEAGUE
IS
DISSOLVED
OCTOBER 9 1890
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I SURVEYED THIS CURT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE
RUEFUL FACE BEHIND IT UNTIL THE COMICAL SIDE OF THE AFFAIR SO
COMPLETELY OVERTOPPED EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAT WE BOTH
BURST OUT INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER
I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING VERY FUNNY CRIED OUR
CLIENT FLUSHING UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS FLAMING HEAD
IF YOU CAN
DO NOTHING BETTER THAN LAUGH AT ME I CAN GO ELSEWHERE
NO NO CRIED HOLMES SHOVING HIM BACK INTO THE CHAIR FROM
WHICH HE HAD HALF RISEN
I REALLY WOULDN'T MISS YOUR CASE FOR
THE WORLD
IT IS MOST REFRESHINGLY UNUSUAL
BUT THERE IS IF YOU
WILL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE FUNNY ABOUT IT
PRAY WHAT STEPS DID YOU TAKE WHEN YOU FOUND THE CARD UPON THE
DOOR
I WAS STAGGERED SIR
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO
THEN I CALLED
AT THE OFFICES ROUND BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT
FINALLY I WENT TO THE LANDLORD WHO IS AN ACCOUNTANT
LIVING ON THE GROUND FLOOR AND I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TELL ME
WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE RED HEADED LEAGUE
HE SAID THAT HE HAD
NEVER HEARD OF ANY SUCH BODY
THEN I ASKED HIM WHO MR
DUNCAN
ROSS WAS
HE ANSWERED THAT THE NAME WAS NEW TO HIM
'WELL SAID I 'THE GENTLEMAN AT NO
4
'WHAT THE RED HEADED MAN
'YES
'OH SAID HE 'HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM MORRIS
HE WAS A SOLICITOR
AND WAS USING MY ROOM AS A TEMPORARY CONVENIENCE UNTIL HIS NEW
PREMISES WERE READY
HE MOVED OUT YESTERDAY
'WHERE COULD I FIND HIM
'OH AT HIS NEW OFFICES
HE DID TELL ME THE ADDRESS
YES 17
KING EDWARD STREET NEAR ST
PAUL'S
I STARTED OFF MR
HOLMES BUT WHEN I GOT TO THAT ADDRESS IT WAS
A MANUFACTORY OF ARTIFICIAL KNEE CAPS AND NO ONE IN IT HAD EVER
HEARD OF EITHER MR
WILLIAM MORRIS OR MR
DUNCAN ROSS
AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN ASKED HOLMES
I WENT HOME TO SAXE COBURG SQUARE AND I TOOK THE ADVICE OF MY
ASSISTANT
BUT HE COULD NOT HELP ME IN ANY WAY
HE COULD ONLY SAY
THAT IF I WAITED I SHOULD HEAR BY POST
BUT THAT WAS NOT QUITE
GOOD ENOUGH MR
HOLMES
I DID NOT WISH TO LOSE SUCH A PLACE
WITHOUT A STRUGGLE SO AS I HAD HEARD THAT YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH
TO GIVE ADVICE TO POOR FOLK WHO WERE IN NEED OF IT I CAME RIGHT
AWAY TO YOU
AND YOU DID VERY WISELY SAID HOLMES
YOUR CASE IS AN
EXCEEDINGLY REMARKABLE ONE AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT
FROM WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
GRAVER ISSUES HANG FROM IT THAN MIGHT AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR
GRAVE ENOUGH SAID MR
JABEZ WILSON
WHY I HAVE LOST FOUR
POUND A WEEK
AS FAR AS YOU ARE PERSONALLY CONCERNED REMARKED HOLMES I DO
NOT SEE THAT YOU HAVE ANY GRIEVANCE AGAINST THIS EXTRAORDINARY
LEAGUE
ON THE CONTRARY YOU ARE AS I UNDERSTAND RICHER BY SOME
30 POUNDS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE MINUTE KNOWLEDGE WHICH YOU HAVE
GAINED ON EVERY SUBJECT WHICH COMES UNDER THE LETTER A
YOU HAVE
LOST NOTHING BY THEM
NO SIR
BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THEM AND WHO THEY ARE
AND WHAT THEIR OBJECT WAS IN PLAYING THIS PRANK IF IT WAS A
PRANK UPON ME
IT WAS A PRETTY EXPENSIVE JOKE FOR THEM FOR IT
COST THEM TWO AND THIRTY POUNDS
WE SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS FOR YOU
AND FIRST
ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS MR
WILSON
THIS ASSISTANT OF YOURS WHO
FIRST CALLED YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISEMENT HOW LONG HAD HE
BEEN WITH YOU
ABOUT A MONTH THEN
HOW DID HE COME
IN ANSWER TO AN ADVERTISEMENT
WAS HE THE ONLY APPLICANT
NO I HAD A DOZEN
WHY DID YOU PICK HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS HANDY AND WOULD COME CHEAP
AT HALF WAGES IN FACT
YES
WHAT IS HE LIKE THIS VINCENT SPAULDING
SMALL STOUT BUILT VERY QUICK IN HIS WAYS NO HAIR ON HIS FACE
THOUGH HE'S NOT SHORT OF THIRTY
HAS A WHITE SPLASH OF ACID UPON
HIS FOREHEAD
HOLMES SAT UP IN HIS CHAIR IN CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT
I THOUGHT
AS MUCH SAID HE
HAVE YOU EVER OBSERVED THAT HIS EARS ARE
PIERCED FOR EARRINGS
YES SIR
HE TOLD ME THAT A GIPSY HAD DONE IT FOR HIM WHEN HE
WAS A LAD
HUM SAID HOLMES SINKING BACK IN DEEP THOUGHT
HE IS STILL
WITH YOU
OH YES SIR I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIM
AND HAS YOUR BUSINESS BEEN ATTENDED TO IN YOUR ABSENCE
NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SIR
THERE'S NEVER VERY MUCH TO DO OF A
MORNING
THAT WILL DO MR
WILSON
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU AN
OPINION UPON THE SUBJECT IN THE COURSE OF A DAY OR TWO
TO DAY IS
SATURDAY AND I HOPE THAT BY MONDAY WE MAY COME TO A CONCLUSION
WELL WATSON SAID HOLMES WHEN OUR VISITOR HAD LEFT US WHAT
DO YOU MAKE OF IT ALL
I MAKE NOTHING OF IT I ANSWERED FRANKLY
IT IS A MOST
MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS
AS A RULE SAID HOLMES THE MORE BIZARRE A THING IS THE LESS
MYSTERIOUS IT PROVES TO BE
IT IS YOUR COMMONPLACE FEATURELESS
CRIMES WHICH ARE REALLY PUZZLING JUST AS A COMMONPLACE FACE IS
THE MOST DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY
BUT I MUST BE PROMPT OVER THIS
MATTER
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO THEN I ASKED
TO SMOKE HE ANSWERED
IT IS QUITE A THREE PIPE PROBLEM AND I
BEG THAT YOU WON'T SPEAK TO ME FOR FIFTY MINUTES HE CURLED
HIMSELF UP IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS THIN KNEES DRAWN UP TO HIS
HAWK LIKE NOSE AND THERE HE SAT WITH HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS
BLACK CLAY PIPE THRUSTING OUT LIKE THE BILL OF SOME STRANGE BIRD
I HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD DROPPED ASLEEP AND
INDEED WAS NODDING MYSELF WHEN HE SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF HIS
CHAIR WITH THE GESTURE OF A MAN WHO HAS MADE UP HIS MIND AND PUT
HIS PIPE DOWN UPON THE MANTELPIECE
SARASATE PLAYS AT THE ST
JAMES'S HALL THIS AFTERNOON HE
REMARKED
WHAT DO YOU THINK WATSON COULD YOUR PATIENTS SPARE
YOU FOR A FEW HOURS
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO TO DAY
MY PRACTICE IS NEVER VERY
ABSORBING
THEN PUT ON YOUR HAT AND COME
I AM GOING THROUGH THE CITY
FIRST AND WE CAN HAVE SOME LUNCH ON THE WAY
I OBSERVE THAT
THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF GERMAN MUSIC ON THE PROGRAMME WHICH IS
RATHER MORE TO MY TASTE THAN ITALIAN OR FRENCH
IT IS
INTROSPECTIVE AND I WANT TO INTROSPECT
COME ALONG
WE TRAVELLED BY THE UNDERGROUND AS FAR AS ALDERSGATE AND A SHORT
WALK TOOK US TO SAXE COBURG SQUARE THE SCENE OF THE SINGULAR
STORY WHICH WE HAD LISTENED TO IN THE MORNING
IT WAS A POKY
LITTLE SHABBY GENTEEL PLACE WHERE FOUR LINES OF DINGY
TWO STORIED BRICK HOUSES LOOKED OUT INTO A SMALL RAILED IN
ENCLOSURE WHERE A LAWN OF WEEDY GRASS AND A FEW CLUMPS OF FADED
LAUREL BUSHES MADE A HARD FIGHT AGAINST A SMOKE LADEN AND
UNCONGENIAL ATMOSPHERE
THREE GILT BALLS AND A BROWN BOARD WITH
JABEZ WILSON IN WHITE LETTERS UPON A CORNER HOUSE ANNOUNCED
THE PLACE WHERE OUR RED HEADED CLIENT CARRIED ON HIS BUSINESS
SHERLOCK HOLMES STOPPED IN FRONT OF IT WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE
AND LOOKED IT ALL OVER WITH HIS EYES SHINING BRIGHTLY BETWEEN
PUCKERED LIDS
THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY UP THE STREET AND THEN DOWN
AGAIN TO THE CORNER STILL LOOKING KEENLY AT THE HOUSES
FINALLY
HE RETURNED TO THE PAWNBROKER'S AND HAVING THUMPED VIGOROUSLY
UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH HIS STICK TWO OR THREE TIMES HE WENT UP
TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED
IT WAS INSTANTLY OPENED BY A
BRIGHT LOOKING CLEAN SHAVEN YOUNG FELLOW WHO ASKED HIM TO STEP
IN
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES I ONLY WISHED TO ASK YOU HOW YOU WOULD
GO FROM HERE TO THE STRAND
THIRD RIGHT FOURTH LEFT ANSWERED THE ASSISTANT PROMPTLY
CLOSING THE DOOR
SMART FELLOW THAT OBSERVED HOLMES AS WE WALKED AWAY
HE IS
IN MY JUDGMENT THE FOURTH SMARTEST MAN IN LONDON AND FOR DARING
I AM NOT SURE THAT HE HAS NOT A CLAIM TO BE THIRD
I HAVE KNOWN
SOMETHING OF HIM BEFORE
EVIDENTLY SAID I MR
WILSON'S ASSISTANT COUNTS FOR A GOOD
DEAL IN THIS MYSTERY OF THE RED HEADED LEAGUE
I AM SURE THAT YOU
INQUIRED YOUR WAY MERELY IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HIM
NOT HIM
WHAT THEN
THE KNEES OF HIS TROUSERS
AND WHAT DID YOU SEE
WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE
WHY DID YOU BEAT THE PAVEMENT
MY DEAR DOCTOR THIS IS A TIME FOR OBSERVATION NOT FOR TALK
WE
ARE SPIES IN AN ENEMY'S COUNTRY
WE KNOW SOMETHING OF SAXE COBURG
SQUARE
LET US NOW EXPLORE THE PARTS WHICH LIE BEHIND IT
THE ROAD IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES AS WE TURNED ROUND THE
CORNER FROM THE RETIRED SAXE COBURG SQUARE PRESENTED AS GREAT A
CONTRAST TO IT AS THE FRONT OF A PICTURE DOES TO THE BACK
IT WAS
ONE OF THE MAIN ARTERIES WHICH CONVEYED THE TRAFFIC OF THE CITY
TO THE NORTH AND WEST
THE ROADWAY WAS BLOCKED WITH THE IMMENSE
STREAM OF COMMERCE FLOWING IN A DOUBLE TIDE INWARD AND OUTWARD
WHILE THE FOOTPATHS WERE BLACK WITH THE HURRYING SWARM OF
PEDESTRIANS
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REALISE AS WE LOOKED AT THE LINE
OF FINE SHOPS AND STATELY BUSINESS PREMISES THAT THEY REALLY
ABUTTED ON THE OTHER SIDE UPON THE FADED AND STAGNANT SQUARE
WHICH WE HAD JUST QUITTED
LET ME SEE SAID HOLMES STANDING AT THE CORNER AND GLANCING
ALONG THE LINE I SHOULD LIKE JUST TO REMEMBER THE ORDER OF THE
HOUSES HERE
IT IS A HOBBY OF MINE TO HAVE AN EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF
LONDON
THERE IS MORTIMER'S THE TOBACCONIST THE LITTLE
NEWSPAPER SHOP THE COBURG BRANCH OF THE CITY AND SUBURBAN BANK
THE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT AND MCFARLANE'S CARRIAGE BUILDING
DEPOT
THAT CARRIES US RIGHT ON TO THE OTHER BLOCK
AND NOW
DOCTOR WE'VE DONE OUR WORK SO IT'S TIME WE HAD SOME PLAY
A
SANDWICH AND A CUP OF COFFEE AND THEN OFF TO VIOLIN LAND WHERE
ALL IS SWEETNESS AND DELICACY AND HARMONY AND THERE ARE NO
RED HEADED CLIENTS TO VEX US WITH THEIR CONUNDRUMS
MY FRIEND WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICIAN BEING HIMSELF NOT ONLY A
VERY CAPABLE PERFORMER BUT A COMPOSER OF NO ORDINARY MERIT
ALL
THE AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS WRAPPED IN THE MOST PERFECT
HAPPINESS GENTLY WAVING HIS LONG THIN FINGERS IN TIME TO THE
MUSIC WHILE HIS GENTLY SMILING FACE AND HIS LANGUID DREAMY EYES
WERE AS UNLIKE THOSE OF HOLMES THE SLEUTH HOUND HOLMES THE
RELENTLESS KEEN WITTED READY HANDED CRIMINAL AGENT AS IT WAS
POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE
IN HIS SINGULAR CHARACTER THE DUAL NATURE
ALTERNATELY ASSERTED ITSELF AND HIS EXTREME EXACTNESS AND
ASTUTENESS REPRESENTED AS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THE REACTION
AGAINST THE POETIC AND CONTEMPLATIVE MOOD WHICH OCCASIONALLY
PREDOMINATED IN HIM
THE SWING OF HIS NATURE TOOK HIM FROM
EXTREME LANGUOR TO DEVOURING ENERGY AND AS I KNEW WELL HE WAS
NEVER SO TRULY FORMIDABLE AS WHEN FOR DAYS ON END HE HAD BEEN
LOUNGING IN HIS ARMCHAIR AMID HIS IMPROVISATIONS AND HIS
BLACK LETTER EDITIONS
THEN IT WAS THAT THE LUST OF THE CHASE
WOULD SUDDENLY COME UPON HIM AND THAT HIS BRILLIANT REASONING
POWER WOULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF INTUITION UNTIL THOSE WHO WERE
UNACQUAINTED WITH HIS METHODS WOULD LOOK ASKANCE AT HIM AS ON A
MAN WHOSE KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT THAT OF OTHER MORTALS
WHEN I SAW HIM
THAT AFTERNOON SO ENWRAPPED IN THE MUSIC AT ST
JAMES'S HALL I
FELT THAT AN EVIL TIME MIGHT BE COMING UPON THOSE WHOM HE HAD SET
HIMSELF TO HUNT DOWN
YOU WANT TO GO HOME NO DOUBT DOCTOR HE REMARKED AS WE
EMERGED
YES IT WOULD BE AS WELL
AND I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO DO WHICH WILL TAKE SOME HOURS
THIS
BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE IS SERIOUS
WHY SERIOUS
A CONSIDERABLE CRIME IS IN CONTEMPLATION
I HAVE EVERY REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL BE IN TIME TO STOP IT
BUT TO DAY BEING
SATURDAY RATHER COMPLICATES MATTERS
I SHALL WANT YOUR HELP
TO NIGHT
AT WHAT TIME
TEN WILL BE EARLY ENOUGH
I SHALL BE AT BAKER STREET AT TEN
VERY WELL
AND I SAY DOCTOR THERE MAY BE SOME LITTLE DANGER
SO KINDLY PUT YOUR ARMY REVOLVER IN YOUR POCKET HE WAVED HIS
HAND TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND DISAPPEARED IN AN INSTANT AMONG THE
CROWD
I TRUST THAT I AM NOT MORE DENSE THAN MY NEIGHBOURS BUT I WAS
ALWAYS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF MY OWN STUPIDITY IN MY DEALINGS
WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES
HERE I HAD HEARD WHAT HE HAD HEARD I HAD
SEEN WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND YET FROM HIS WORDS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT
HE SAW CLEARLY NOT ONLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO
HAPPEN WHILE TO ME THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS STILL CONFUSED AND
GROTESQUE
AS I DROVE HOME TO MY HOUSE IN KENSINGTON I THOUGHT
OVER IT ALL FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF THE RED HEADED
COPIER OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA DOWN TO THE VISIT TO SAXE COBURG
SQUARE AND THE OMINOUS WORDS WITH WHICH HE HAD PARTED FROM ME
WHAT WAS THIS NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION AND WHY SHOULD I GO ARMED
WHERE WERE WE GOING AND WHAT WERE WE TO DO I HAD THE HINT FROM
HOLMES THAT THIS SMOOTH FACED PAWNBROKER'S ASSISTANT WAS A
FORMIDABLE MAN A MAN WHO MIGHT PLAY A DEEP GAME
I TRIED TO
PUZZLE IT OUT BUT GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND SET THE MATTER ASIDE
UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD BRING AN EXPLANATION
IT WAS A QUARTER PAST NINE WHEN I STARTED FROM HOME AND MADE MY
WAY ACROSS THE PARK AND SO THROUGH OXFORD STREET TO BAKER
STREET
TWO HANSOMS WERE STANDING AT THE DOOR AND AS I ENTERED
THE PASSAGE I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES FROM ABOVE
ON ENTERING
HIS ROOM I FOUND HOLMES IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION WITH TWO MEN
ONE OF WHOM I RECOGNISED AS PETER JONES THE OFFICIAL POLICE
AGENT WHILE THE OTHER WAS A LONG THIN SAD FACED MAN WITH A
VERY SHINY HAT AND OPPRESSIVELY RESPECTABLE FROCK COAT
HA OUR PARTY IS COMPLETE SAID HOLMES BUTTONING UP HIS
PEA JACKET AND TAKING HIS HEAVY HUNTING CROP FROM THE RACK
WATSON I THINK YOU KNOW MR
JONES OF SCOTLAND YARD LET ME
INTRODUCE YOU TO MR
MERRYWEATHER WHO IS TO BE OUR COMPANION IN
TO NIGHT'S ADVENTURE
WE'RE HUNTING IN COUPLES AGAIN DOCTOR YOU SEE SAID JONES IN
HIS CONSEQUENTIAL WAY
OUR FRIEND HERE IS A WONDERFUL MAN FOR
STARTING A CHASE
ALL HE WANTS IS AN OLD DOG TO HELP HIM TO DO
THE RUNNING DOWN
I HOPE A WILD GOOSE MAY NOT PROVE TO BE THE END OF OUR CHASE
OBSERVED MR
MERRYWEATHER GLOOMILY
YOU MAY PLACE CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE IN MR
HOLMES SIR SAID
THE POLICE AGENT LOFTILY
HE HAS HIS OWN LITTLE METHODS WHICH
ARE IF HE WON'T MIND MY SAYING SO JUST A LITTLE TOO THEORETICAL
AND FANTASTIC BUT HE HAS THE MAKINGS OF A DETECTIVE IN HIM
IT
IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT ONCE OR TWICE AS IN THAT BUSINESS OF
THE SHOLTO MURDER AND THE AGRA TREASURE HE HAS BEEN MORE NEARLY
CORRECT THAN THE OFFICIAL FORCE
OH IF YOU SAY SO MR
JONES IT IS ALL RIGHT SAID THE
STRANGER WITH DEFERENCE
STILL I CONFESS THAT I MISS MY RUBBER
IT IS THE FIRST SATURDAY NIGHT FOR SEVEN AND TWENTY YEARS THAT I
HAVE NOT HAD MY RUBBER
I THINK YOU WILL FIND SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES THAT YOU WILL
PLAY FOR A HIGHER STAKE TO NIGHT THAN YOU HAVE EVER DONE YET AND
THAT THE PLAY WILL BE MORE EXCITING
FOR YOU MR
MERRYWEATHER
THE STAKE WILL BE SOME 30 000 POUNDS AND FOR YOU JONES IT WILL
BE THE MAN UPON WHOM YOU WISH TO LAY YOUR HANDS
JOHN CLAY THE MURDERER THIEF SMASHER AND FORGER
HE'S A
YOUNG MAN MR
MERRYWEATHER BUT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS
PROFESSION AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY BRACELETS ON HIM THAN ON
ANY CRIMINAL IN LONDON
HE'S A REMARKABLE MAN IS YOUNG JOHN
CLAY
HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A ROYAL DUKE AND HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN
TO ETON AND OXFORD
HIS BRAIN IS AS CUNNING AS HIS FINGERS AND
THOUGH WE MEET SIGNS OF HIM AT EVERY TURN WE NEVER KNOW WHERE TO
FIND THE MAN HIMSELF
HE'LL CRACK A CRIB IN SCOTLAND ONE WEEK
AND BE RAISING MONEY TO BUILD AN ORPHANAGE IN CORNWALL THE NEXT
I'VE BEEN ON HIS TRACK FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM
YET
I HOPE THAT I MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING YOU TO NIGHT
I'VE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE TURNS ALSO WITH MR
JOHN CLAY AND I
AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION
IT IS
PAST TEN HOWEVER AND QUITE TIME THAT WE STARTED
IF YOU TWO
WILL TAKE THE FIRST HANSOM WATSON AND I WILL FOLLOW IN THE
SECOND
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE DURING THE LONG DRIVE
AND LAY BACK IN THE CAB HUMMING THE TUNES WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN
THE AFTERNOON
WE RATTLED THROUGH AN ENDLESS LABYRINTH OF GAS LIT
STREETS UNTIL WE EMERGED INTO FARRINGTON STREET
WE ARE CLOSE THERE NOW MY FRIEND REMARKED
THIS FELLOW
MERRYWEATHER IS A BANK DIRECTOR AND PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE
MATTER
I THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO HAVE JONES WITH US ALSO
HE IS
NOT A BAD FELLOW THOUGH AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE IN HIS PROFESSION
HE HAS ONE POSITIVE VIRTUE
HE IS AS BRAVE AS A BULLDOG AND AS
TENACIOUS AS A LOBSTER IF HE GETS HIS CLAWS UPON ANYONE
HERE WE
ARE AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR US
WE HAD REACHED THE SAME CROWDED THOROUGHFARE IN WHICH WE HAD
FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MORNING
OUR CABS WERE DISMISSED AND
FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF MR
MERRYWEATHER WE PASSED DOWN A
NARROW PASSAGE AND THROUGH A SIDE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED FOR US
WITHIN THERE WAS A SMALL CORRIDOR WHICH ENDED IN A VERY MASSIVE
IRON GATE
THIS ALSO WAS OPENED AND LED DOWN A FLIGHT OF WINDING
STONE STEPS WHICH TERMINATED AT ANOTHER FORMIDABLE GATE
MR
MERRYWEATHER STOPPED TO LIGHT A LANTERN AND THEN CONDUCTED US
DOWN A DARK EARTH SMELLING PASSAGE AND SO AFTER OPENING A
THIRD DOOR INTO A HUGE VAULT OR CELLAR WHICH WAS PILED ALL
ROUND WITH CRATES AND MASSIVE BOXES
YOU ARE NOT VERY VULNERABLE FROM ABOVE HOLMES REMARKED AS HE
HELD UP THE LANTERN AND GAZED ABOUT HIM
NOR FROM BELOW SAID MR
MERRYWEATHER STRIKING HIS STICK UPON
THE FLAGS WHICH LINED THE FLOOR
WHY DEAR ME IT SOUNDS QUITE
HOLLOW HE REMARKED LOOKING UP IN SURPRISE
I MUST REALLY ASK YOU TO BE A LITTLE MORE QUIET SAID HOLMES
SEVERELY
YOU HAVE ALREADY IMPERILLED THE WHOLE SUCCESS OF OUR
EXPEDITION
MIGHT I BEG THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SIT
DOWN UPON ONE OF THOSE BOXES AND NOT TO INTERFERE
THE SOLEMN MR
MERRYWEATHER PERCHED HIMSELF UPON A CRATE WITH A
VERY INJURED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE WHILE HOLMES FELL UPON HIS
KNEES UPON THE FLOOR AND WITH THE LANTERN AND A MAGNIFYING LENS
BEGAN TO EXAMINE MINUTELY THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES
A FEW
SECONDS SUFFICED TO SATISFY HIM FOR HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN
AND PUT HIS GLASS IN HIS POCKET
WE HAVE AT LEAST AN HOUR BEFORE US HE REMARKED FOR THEY CAN
HARDLY TAKE ANY STEPS UNTIL THE GOOD PAWNBROKER IS SAFELY IN BED
THEN THEY WILL NOT LOSE A MINUTE FOR THE SOONER THEY DO THEIR
WORK THE LONGER TIME THEY WILL HAVE FOR THEIR ESCAPE
WE ARE AT
PRESENT DOCTOR AS NO DOUBT YOU HAVE DIVINED IN THE CELLAR OF
THE CITY BRANCH OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LONDON BANKS
MR
MERRYWEATHER IS THE CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS AND HE WILL EXPLAIN TO
YOU THAT THERE ARE REASONS WHY THE MORE DARING CRIMINALS OF
LONDON SHOULD TAKE A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CELLAR AT
PRESENT
IT IS OUR FRENCH GOLD WHISPERED THE DIRECTOR
WE HAVE HAD
SEVERAL WARNINGS THAT AN ATTEMPT MIGHT BE MADE UPON IT
YOUR FRENCH GOLD
YES
WE HAD OCCASION SOME MONTHS AGO TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESOURCES
AND BORROWED FOR THAT PURPOSE 30 000 NAPOLEONS FROM THE BANK OF
FRANCE
IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO
UNPACK THE MONEY AND THAT IT IS STILL LYING IN OUR CELLAR
THE
CRATE UPON WHICH I SIT CONTAINS 2 000 NAPOLEONS PACKED BETWEEN
LAYERS OF LEAD FOIL
OUR RESERVE OF BULLION IS MUCH LARGER AT
PRESENT THAN IS USUALLY KEPT IN A SINGLE BRANCH OFFICE AND THE
DIRECTORS HAVE HAD MISGIVINGS UPON THE SUBJECT
WHICH WERE VERY WELL JUSTIFIED OBSERVED HOLMES
AND NOW IT IS
TIME THAT WE ARRANGED OUR LITTLE PLANS
I EXPECT THAT WITHIN AN
HOUR MATTERS WILL COME TO A HEAD
IN THE MEANTIME MR
MERRYWEATHER WE MUST PUT THE SCREEN OVER THAT DARK LANTERN
AND SIT IN THE DARK
I AM AFRAID SO
I HAD BROUGHT A PACK OF CARDS IN MY POCKET AND
I THOUGHT THAT AS WE WERE A PARTIE CARRE YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR
RUBBER AFTER ALL
BUT I SEE THAT THE ENEMY'S PREPARATIONS HAVE
GONE SO FAR THAT WE CANNOT RISK THE PRESENCE OF A LIGHT
AND
FIRST OF ALL WE MUST CHOOSE OUR POSITIONS
THESE ARE DARING MEN
AND THOUGH WE SHALL TAKE THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE THEY MAY DO US
SOME HARM UNLESS WE ARE CAREFUL
I SHALL STAND BEHIND THIS CRATE
AND DO YOU CONCEAL YOURSELVES BEHIND THOSE
THEN WHEN I FLASH A
LIGHT UPON THEM CLOSE IN SWIFTLY
IF THEY FIRE WATSON HAVE NO
COMPUNCTION ABOUT SHOOTING THEM DOWN
I PLACED MY REVOLVER COCKED UPON THE TOP OF THE WOODEN CASE
BEHIND WHICH I CROUCHED
HOLMES SHOT THE SLIDE ACROSS THE FRONT
OF HIS LANTERN AND LEFT US IN PITCH DARKNESS SUCH AN ABSOLUTE
DARKNESS AS I HAVE NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED
THE SMELL OF HOT
METAL REMAINED TO ASSURE US THAT THE LIGHT WAS STILL THERE READY
TO FLASH OUT AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
TO ME WITH MY NERVES WORKED
UP TO A PITCH OF EXPECTANCY THERE WAS SOMETHING DEPRESSING AND
SUBDUING IN THE SUDDEN GLOOM AND IN THE COLD DANK AIR OF THE
VAULT
THEY HAVE BUT ONE RETREAT WHISPERED HOLMES
THAT IS BACK
THROUGH THE HOUSE INTO SAXE COBURG SQUARE
I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE
DONE WHAT I ASKED YOU JONES
I HAVE AN INSPECTOR AND TWO OFFICERS WAITING AT THE FRONT DOOR
THEN WE HAVE STOPPED ALL THE HOLES
AND NOW WE MUST BE SILENT
AND WAIT
WHAT A TIME IT SEEMED FROM COMPARING NOTES AFTERWARDS IT WAS BUT
AN HOUR AND A QUARTER YET IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE NIGHT MUST
HAVE ALMOST GONE AND THE DAWN BE BREAKING ABOVE US
MY LIMBS
WERE WEARY AND STIFF FOR I FEARED TO CHANGE MY POSITION YET MY
NERVES WERE WORKED UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF TENSION AND MY
HEARING WAS SO ACUTE THAT I COULD NOT ONLY HEAR THE GENTLE
BREATHING OF MY COMPANIONS BUT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE DEEPER
HEAVIER IN BREATH OF THE BULKY JONES FROM THE THIN SIGHING NOTE
OF THE BANK DIRECTOR
FROM MY POSITION I COULD LOOK OVER THE CASE
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOOR
SUDDENLY MY EYES CAUGHT THE GLINT
OF A LIGHT
AT FIRST IT WAS BUT A LURID SPARK UPON THE STONE PAVEMENT
THEN
IT LENGTHENED OUT UNTIL IT BECAME A YELLOW LINE AND THEN
WITHOUT ANY WARNING OR SOUND A GASH SEEMED TO OPEN AND A HAND
APPEARED A WHITE ALMOST WOMANLY HAND WHICH FELT ABOUT IN THE
CENTRE OF THE LITTLE AREA OF LIGHT
FOR A MINUTE OR MORE THE
HAND WITH ITS WRITHING FINGERS PROTRUDED OUT OF THE FLOOR
THEN
IT WAS WITHDRAWN AS SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED AND ALL WAS DARK
AGAIN SAVE THE SINGLE LURID SPARK WHICH MARKED A CHINK BETWEEN
THE STONES
ITS DISAPPEARANCE HOWEVER WAS BUT MOMENTARY
WITH A RENDING
TEARING SOUND ONE OF THE BROAD WHITE STONES TURNED OVER UPON
ITS SIDE AND LEFT A SQUARE GAPING HOLE THROUGH WHICH STREAMED
THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN
OVER THE EDGE THERE PEEPED A CLEAN CUT
BOYISH FACE WHICH LOOKED KEENLY ABOUT IT AND THEN WITH A HAND
ON EITHER SIDE OF THE APERTURE DREW ITSELF SHOULDER HIGH AND
WAIST HIGH UNTIL ONE KNEE RESTED UPON THE EDGE
IN ANOTHER
INSTANT HE STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE HOLE AND WAS HAULING AFTER
HIM A COMPANION LITHE AND SMALL LIKE HIMSELF WITH A PALE FACE
AND A SHOCK OF VERY RED HAIR
IT'S ALL CLEAR HE WHISPERED
HAVE YOU THE CHISEL AND THE
BAGS GREAT SCOTT JUMP ARCHIE JUMP AND I'LL SWING FOR IT
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD SPRUNG OUT AND SEIZED THE INTRUDER BY THE
COLLAR
THE OTHER DIVED DOWN THE HOLE AND I HEARD THE SOUND OF
RENDING CLOTH AS JONES CLUTCHED AT HIS SKIRTS
THE LIGHT FLASHED
UPON THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER BUT HOLMES' HUNTING CROP CAME
DOWN ON THE MAN'S WRIST AND THE PISTOL CLINKED UPON THE STONE
FLOOR
IT'S NO USE JOHN CLAY SAID HOLMES BLANDLY
YOU HAVE NO
CHANCE AT ALL
SO I SEE THE OTHER ANSWERED WITH THE UTMOST COOLNESS
I FANCY
THAT MY PAL IS ALL RIGHT THOUGH I SEE YOU HAVE GOT HIS
COAT TAILS
THERE ARE THREE MEN WAITING FOR HIM AT THE DOOR SAID HOLMES
OH INDEED YOU SEEM TO HAVE DONE THE THING VERY COMPLETELY
I
MUST COMPLIMENT YOU
AND I YOU HOLMES ANSWERED
YOUR RED HEADED IDEA WAS VERY NEW
AND EFFECTIVE
YOU'LL SEE YOUR PAL AGAIN PRESENTLY SAID JONES
HE'S QUICKER
AT CLIMBING DOWN HOLES THAN I AM
JUST HOLD OUT WHILE I FIX THE
DERBIES
I BEG THAT YOU WILL NOT TOUCH ME WITH YOUR FILTHY HANDS
REMARKED OUR PRISONER AS THE HANDCUFFS CLATTERED UPON HIS WRISTS
YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE THAT I HAVE ROYAL BLOOD IN MY VEINS
HAVE
THE GOODNESS ALSO WHEN YOU ADDRESS ME ALWAYS TO SAY 'SIR' AND
'PLEASE
ALL RIGHT SAID JONES WITH A STARE AND A SNIGGER
WELL WOULD
YOU PLEASE SIR MARCH UPSTAIRS WHERE WE CAN GET A CAB TO CARRY
YOUR HIGHNESS TO THE POLICE STATION
THAT IS BETTER SAID JOHN CLAY SERENELY
HE MADE A SWEEPING BOW
TO THE THREE OF US AND WALKED QUIETLY OFF IN THE CUSTODY OF THE
DETECTIVE
REALLY MR
HOLMES SAID MR
MERRYWEATHER AS WE FOLLOWED THEM
FROM THE CELLAR I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE BANK CAN THANK YOU OR
REPAY YOU
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE DETECTED AND DEFEATED
IN THE MOST COMPLETE MANNER ONE OF THE MOST DETERMINED ATTEMPTS
AT BANK ROBBERY THAT HAVE EVER COME WITHIN MY EXPERIENCE
I HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE SCORES OF MY OWN TO SETTLE WITH MR
JOHN CLAY SAID HOLMES
I HAVE BEEN AT SOME SMALL EXPENSE OVER
THIS MATTER WHICH I SHALL EXPECT THE BANK TO REFUND BUT BEYOND
THAT I AM AMPLY REPAID BY HAVING HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHICH IS IN
MANY WAYS UNIQUE AND BY HEARING THE VERY REMARKABLE NARRATIVE OF
THE RED HEADED LEAGUE
YOU SEE WATSON HE EXPLAINED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING
AS WE SAT OVER A GLASS OF WHISKY AND SODA IN BAKER STREET IT
WAS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST THAT THE ONLY POSSIBLE
OBJECT OF THIS RATHER FANTASTIC BUSINESS OF THE ADVERTISEMENT OF
THE LEAGUE AND THE COPYING OF THE 'ENCYCLOPAEDIA MUST BE TO GET
THIS NOT OVER BRIGHT PAWNBROKER OUT OF THE WAY FOR A NUMBER OF
HOURS EVERY DAY
IT WAS A CURIOUS WAY OF MANAGING IT BUT
REALLY IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A BETTER
THE METHOD WAS
NO DOUBT SUGGESTED TO CLAY'S INGENIOUS MIND BY THE COLOUR OF HIS
ACCOMPLICE'S HAIR
THE 4 POUNDS A WEEK WAS A LURE WHICH MUST DRAW
HIM AND WHAT WAS IT TO THEM WHO WERE PLAYING FOR THOUSANDS
THEY PUT IN THE ADVERTISEMENT ONE ROGUE HAS THE TEMPORARY
OFFICE THE OTHER ROGUE INCITES THE MAN TO APPLY FOR IT AND
TOGETHER THEY MANAGE TO SECURE HIS ABSENCE EVERY MORNING IN THE
WEEK
FROM THE TIME THAT I HEARD OF THE ASSISTANT HAVING COME FOR
HALF WAGES IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT HE HAD SOME STRONG MOTIVE
FOR SECURING THE SITUATION
BUT HOW COULD YOU GUESS WHAT THE MOTIVE WAS
HAD THERE BEEN WOMEN IN THE HOUSE I SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED A
MERE VULGAR INTRIGUE
THAT HOWEVER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION
THE
MAN'S BUSINESS WAS A SMALL ONE AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS
HOUSE WHICH COULD ACCOUNT FOR SUCH ELABORATE PREPARATIONS AND
SUCH AN EXPENDITURE AS THEY WERE AT
IT MUST THEN BE SOMETHING
OUT OF THE HOUSE
WHAT COULD IT BE I THOUGHT OF THE ASSISTANT'S
FONDNESS FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AND HIS TRICK OF VANISHING INTO THE
CELLAR
THE CELLAR THERE WAS THE END OF THIS TANGLED CLUE
THEN
I MADE INQUIRIES AS TO THIS MYSTERIOUS ASSISTANT AND FOUND THAT I
HAD TO DEAL WITH ONE OF THE COOLEST AND MOST DARING CRIMINALS IN
LONDON
HE WAS DOING SOMETHING IN THE CELLAR SOMETHING WHICH
TOOK MANY HOURS A DAY FOR MONTHS ON END
WHAT COULD IT BE ONCE
MORE I COULD THINK OF NOTHING SAVE THAT HE WAS RUNNING A TUNNEL
TO SOME OTHER BUILDING
SO FAR I HAD GOT WHEN WE WENT TO VISIT THE SCENE OF ACTION
I
SURPRISED YOU BY BEATING UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH MY STICK
I WAS
ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE CELLAR STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OR BEHIND
IT WAS NOT IN FRONT
THEN I RANG THE BELL AND AS I HOPED THE
ASSISTANT ANSWERED IT
WE HAVE HAD SOME SKIRMISHES BUT WE HAD
NEVER SET EYES UPON EACH OTHER BEFORE
I HARDLY LOOKED AT HIS
FACE
HIS KNEES WERE WHAT I WISHED TO SEE
YOU MUST YOURSELF HAVE
REMARKED HOW WORN WRINKLED AND STAINED THEY WERE
THEY SPOKE OF
THOSE HOURS OF BURROWING
THE ONLY REMAINING POINT WAS WHAT THEY
WERE BURROWING FOR
I WALKED ROUND THE CORNER SAW THE CITY AND
SUBURBAN BANK ABUTTED ON OUR FRIEND'S PREMISES AND FELT THAT I
HAD SOLVED MY PROBLEM
WHEN YOU DROVE HOME AFTER THE CONCERT I
CALLED UPON SCOTLAND YARD AND UPON THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BANK
DIRECTORS WITH THE RESULT THAT YOU HAVE SEEN
AND HOW COULD YOU TELL THAT THEY WOULD MAKE THEIR ATTEMPT
TO NIGHT I ASKED
WELL WHEN THEY CLOSED THEIR LEAGUE OFFICES THAT WAS A SIGN THAT
THEY CARED NO LONGER ABOUT MR
JABEZ WILSON'S PRESENCE IN OTHER
WORDS THAT THEY HAD COMPLETED THEIR TUNNEL
BUT IT WAS ESSENTIAL
THAT THEY SHOULD USE IT SOON AS IT MIGHT BE DISCOVERED OR THE
BULLION MIGHT BE REMOVED
SATURDAY WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN
ANY OTHER DAY AS IT WOULD GIVE THEM TWO DAYS FOR THEIR ESCAPE
FOR ALL THESE REASONS I EXPECTED THEM TO COME TO NIGHT
YOU REASONED IT OUT BEAUTIFULLY I EXCLAIMED IN UNFEIGNED
ADMIRATION
IT IS SO LONG A CHAIN AND YET EVERY LINK RINGS
TRUE
IT SAVED ME FROM ENNUI HE ANSWERED YAWNING
ALAS I ALREADY
FEEL IT CLOSING IN UPON ME
MY LIFE IS SPENT IN ONE LONG EFFORT
TO ESCAPE FROM THE COMMONPLACES OF EXISTENCE
THESE LITTLE
PROBLEMS HELP ME TO DO SO
AND YOU ARE A BENEFACTOR OF THE RACE SAID I
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
WELL PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT IS OF
SOME LITTLE USE HE REMARKED
'L'HOMME C'EST RIEN L'OEUVRE
C'EST TOUT AS GUSTAVE FLAUBERT WROTE TO GEORGE SAND
ADVENTURE III
A CASE OF IDENTITY
MY DEAR FELLOW SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE SAT ON EITHER SIDE
OF THE FIRE IN HIS LODGINGS AT BAKER STREET LIFE IS INFINITELY
STRANGER THAN ANYTHING WHICH THE MIND OF MAN COULD INVENT
WE
WOULD NOT DARE TO CONCEIVE THE THINGS WHICH ARE REALLY MERE
COMMONPLACES OF EXISTENCE
IF WE COULD FLY OUT OF THAT WINDOW
HAND IN HAND HOVER OVER THIS GREAT CITY GENTLY REMOVE THE
ROOFS AND PEEP IN AT THE QUEER THINGS WHICH ARE GOING ON THE
STRANGE COINCIDENCES THE PLANNINGS THE CROSS PURPOSES THE
WONDERFUL CHAINS OF EVENTS WORKING THROUGH GENERATIONS AND
LEADING TO THE MOST OUTR RESULTS IT WOULD MAKE ALL FICTION WITH
ITS CONVENTIONALITIES AND FORESEEN CONCLUSIONS MOST STALE AND
UNPROFITABLE
AND YET I AM NOT CONVINCED OF IT I ANSWERED
THE CASES WHICH
COME TO LIGHT IN THE PAPERS ARE AS A RULE BALD ENOUGH AND
VULGAR ENOUGH
WE HAVE IN OUR POLICE REPORTS REALISM PUSHED TO
ITS EXTREME LIMITS AND YET THE RESULT IS IT MUST BE CONFESSED
NEITHER FASCINATING NOR ARTISTIC
A CERTAIN SELECTION AND DISCRETION MUST BE USED IN PRODUCING A
REALISTIC EFFECT REMARKED HOLMES
THIS IS WANTING IN THE
POLICE REPORT WHERE MORE STRESS IS LAID PERHAPS UPON THE
PLATITUDES OF THE MAGISTRATE THAN UPON THE DETAILS WHICH TO AN
OBSERVER CONTAIN THE VITAL ESSENCE OF THE WHOLE MATTER
DEPEND
UPON IT THERE IS NOTHING SO UNNATURAL AS THE COMMONPLACE
I SMILED AND SHOOK MY HEAD
I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND YOUR THINKING
SO I SAID
OF COURSE IN YOUR POSITION OF UNOFFICIAL ADVISER
AND HELPER TO EVERYBODY WHO IS ABSOLUTELY PUZZLED THROUGHOUT
THREE CONTINENTS YOU ARE BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH ALL THAT IS
STRANGE AND BIZARRE
BUT HERE I PICKED UP THE MORNING PAPER
FROM THE GROUND LET US PUT IT TO A PRACTICAL TEST
HERE IS THE
FIRST HEADING UPON WHICH I COME
'A HUSBAND'S CRUELTY TO HIS
WIFE THERE IS HALF A COLUMN OF PRINT BUT I KNOW WITHOUT
READING IT THAT IT IS ALL PERFECTLY FAMILIAR TO ME
THERE IS OF
COURSE THE OTHER WOMAN THE DRINK THE PUSH THE BLOW THE
BRUISE THE SYMPATHETIC SISTER OR LANDLADY
THE CRUDEST OF
WRITERS COULD INVENT NOTHING MORE CRUDE
INDEED YOUR EXAMPLE IS AN UNFORTUNATE ONE FOR YOUR ARGUMENT
SAID HOLMES TAKING THE PAPER AND GLANCING HIS EYE DOWN IT
THIS
IS THE DUNDAS SEPARATION CASE AND AS IT HAPPENS I WAS ENGAGED
IN CLEARING UP SOME SMALL POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH IT
THE
HUSBAND WAS A TEETOTALER THERE WAS NO OTHER WOMAN AND THE
CONDUCT COMPLAINED OF WAS THAT HE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE HABIT OF
WINDING UP EVERY MEAL BY TAKING OUT HIS FALSE TEETH AND HURLING
THEM AT HIS WIFE WHICH YOU WILL ALLOW IS NOT AN ACTION LIKELY
TO OCCUR TO THE IMAGINATION OF THE AVERAGE STORY TELLER
TAKE A
PINCH OF SNUFF DOCTOR AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE SCORED OVER
YOU IN YOUR EXAMPLE
HE HELD OUT HIS SNUFFBOX OF OLD GOLD WITH A GREAT AMETHYST IN
THE CENTRE OF THE LID
ITS SPLENDOUR WAS IN SUCH CONTRAST TO HIS
HOMELY WAYS AND SIMPLE LIFE THAT I COULD NOT HELP COMMENTING UPON
IT
AH SAID HE I FORGOT THAT I HAD NOT SEEN YOU FOR SOME WEEKS
IT IS A LITTLE SOUVENIR FROM THE KING OF BOHEMIA IN RETURN FOR MY
ASSISTANCE IN THE CASE OF THE IRENE ADLER PAPERS
AND THE RING I ASKED GLANCING AT A REMARKABLE BRILLIANT WHICH
SPARKLED UPON HIS FINGER
IT WAS FROM THE REIGNING FAMILY OF HOLLAND THOUGH THE MATTER IN
WHICH I SERVED THEM WAS OF SUCH DELICACY THAT I CANNOT CONFIDE IT
EVEN TO YOU WHO HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO CHRONICLE ONE OR TWO OF
MY LITTLE PROBLEMS
AND HAVE YOU ANY ON HAND JUST NOW I ASKED WITH INTEREST
SOME TEN OR TWELVE BUT NONE WHICH PRESENT ANY FEATURE OF
INTEREST
THEY ARE IMPORTANT YOU UNDERSTAND WITHOUT BEING
INTERESTING
INDEED I HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS USUALLY IN
UNIMPORTANT MATTERS THAT THERE IS A FIELD FOR THE OBSERVATION
AND FOR THE QUICK ANALYSIS OF CAUSE AND EFFECT WHICH GIVES THE
CHARM TO AN INVESTIGATION
THE LARGER CRIMES ARE APT TO BE THE
SIMPLER FOR THE BIGGER THE CRIME THE MORE OBVIOUS AS A RULE IS
THE MOTIVE
IN THESE CASES SAVE FOR ONE RATHER INTRICATE MATTER
WHICH HAS BEEN REFERRED TO ME FROM MARSEILLES THERE IS NOTHING
WHICH PRESENTS ANY FEATURES OF INTEREST
IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER
THAT I MAY HAVE SOMETHING BETTER BEFORE VERY MANY MINUTES ARE
OVER FOR THIS IS ONE OF MY CLIENTS OR I AM MUCH MISTAKEN
HE HAD RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAS STANDING BETWEEN THE PARTED
BLINDS GAZING DOWN INTO THE DULL NEUTRAL TINTED LONDON STREET
LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER I SAW THAT ON THE PAVEMENT OPPOSITE
THERE STOOD A LARGE WOMAN WITH A HEAVY FUR BOA ROUND HER NECK
AND A LARGE CURLING RED FEATHER IN A BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHICH WAS
TILTED IN A COQUETTISH DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE FASHION OVER HER
EAR
FROM UNDER THIS GREAT PANOPLY SHE PEEPED UP IN A NERVOUS
HESITATING FASHION AT OUR WINDOWS WHILE HER BODY OSCILLATED
BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND HER FINGERS FIDGETED WITH HER GLOVE
BUTTONS
SUDDENLY WITH A PLUNGE AS OF THE SWIMMER WHO LEAVES
THE BANK SHE HURRIED ACROSS THE ROAD AND WE HEARD THE SHARP
CLANG OF THE BELL
I HAVE SEEN THOSE SYMPTOMS BEFORE SAID HOLMES THROWING HIS
CIGARETTE INTO THE FIRE
OSCILLATION UPON THE PAVEMENT ALWAYS
MEANS AN AFFAIRE DE COEUR
SHE WOULD LIKE ADVICE BUT IS NOT SURE
THAT THE MATTER IS NOT TOO DELICATE FOR COMMUNICATION
AND YET
EVEN HERE WE MAY DISCRIMINATE
WHEN A WOMAN HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY
WRONGED BY A MAN SHE NO LONGER OSCILLATES AND THE USUAL SYMPTOM
IS A BROKEN BELL WIRE
HERE WE MAY TAKE IT THAT THERE IS A LOVE
MATTER BUT THAT THE MAIDEN IS NOT SO MUCH ANGRY AS PERPLEXED OR
GRIEVED
BUT HERE SHE COMES IN PERSON TO RESOLVE OUR DOUBTS
AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS A TAP AT THE DOOR AND THE BOY IN BUTTONS
ENTERED TO ANNOUNCE MISS MARY SUTHERLAND WHILE THE LADY HERSELF
LOOMED BEHIND HIS SMALL BLACK FIGURE LIKE A FULL SAILED
MERCHANT MAN BEHIND A TINY PILOT BOAT
SHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED
HER WITH THE EASY COURTESY FOR WHICH HE WAS REMARKABLE AND
HAVING CLOSED THE DOOR AND BOWED HER INTO AN ARMCHAIR HE LOOKED
HER OVER IN THE MINUTE AND YET ABSTRACTED FASHION WHICH WAS
PECULIAR TO HIM
DO YOU NOT FIND HE SAID THAT WITH YOUR SHORT SIGHT IT IS A
LITTLE TRYING TO DO SO MUCH TYPEWRITING
I DID AT FIRST SHE ANSWERED BUT NOW I KNOW WHERE THE LETTERS
ARE WITHOUT LOOKING THEN SUDDENLY REALISING THE FULL PURPORT
OF HIS WORDS SHE GAVE A VIOLENT START AND LOOKED UP WITH FEAR
AND ASTONISHMENT UPON HER BROAD GOOD HUMOURED FACE
YOU'VE
HEARD ABOUT ME MR
HOLMES SHE CRIED ELSE HOW COULD YOU KNOW
ALL THAT
NEVER MIND SAID HOLMES LAUGHING IT IS MY BUSINESS TO KNOW
THINGS
PERHAPS I HAVE TRAINED MYSELF TO SEE WHAT OTHERS
OVERLOOK
IF NOT WHY SHOULD YOU COME TO CONSULT ME
I CAME TO YOU SIR BECAUSE I HEARD OF YOU FROM MRS
ETHEREGE
WHOSE HUSBAND YOU FOUND SO EASY WHEN THE POLICE AND EVERYONE HAD
GIVEN HIM UP FOR DEAD
OH MR
HOLMES I WISH YOU WOULD DO AS
MUCH FOR ME
I'M NOT RICH BUT STILL I HAVE A HUNDRED A YEAR IN
MY OWN RIGHT BESIDES THE LITTLE THAT I MAKE BY THE MACHINE AND
I WOULD GIVE IT ALL TO KNOW WHAT HAS BECOME OF MR
HOSMER ANGEL
WHY DID YOU COME AWAY TO CONSULT ME IN SUCH A HURRY ASKED
SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH HIS FINGER TIPS TOGETHER AND HIS EYES TO
THE CEILING
AGAIN A STARTLED LOOK CAME OVER THE SOMEWHAT VACUOUS FACE OF MISS
MARY SUTHERLAND
YES I DID BANG OUT OF THE HOUSE SHE SAID
FOR IT MADE ME ANGRY TO SEE THE EASY WAY IN WHICH MR
WINDIBANK THAT IS MY FATHER TOOK IT ALL
HE WOULD NOT GO TO
THE POLICE AND HE WOULD NOT GO TO YOU AND SO AT LAST AS HE
WOULD DO NOTHING AND KEPT ON SAYING THAT THERE WAS NO HARM DONE
IT MADE ME MAD AND I JUST ON WITH MY THINGS AND CAME RIGHT AWAY
TO YOU
YOUR FATHER SAID HOLMES YOUR STEPFATHER SURELY SINCE THE
NAME IS DIFFERENT
YES MY STEPFATHER
I CALL HIM FATHER THOUGH IT SOUNDS FUNNY
TOO FOR HE IS ONLY FIVE YEARS AND TWO MONTHS OLDER THAN MYSELF
AND YOUR MOTHER IS ALIVE
OH YES MOTHER IS ALIVE AND WELL
I WASN'T BEST PLEASED MR
HOLMES WHEN SHE MARRIED AGAIN SO SOON AFTER FATHER'S DEATH AND
A MAN WHO WAS NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HERSELF
FATHER
WAS A PLUMBER IN THE TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AND HE LEFT A TIDY
BUSINESS BEHIND HIM WHICH MOTHER CARRIED ON WITH MR
HARDY THE
FOREMAN BUT WHEN MR
WINDIBANK CAME HE MADE HER SELL THE
BUSINESS FOR HE WAS VERY SUPERIOR BEING A TRAVELLER IN WINES
THEY GOT 4700 POUNDS FOR THE GOODWILL AND INTEREST WHICH WASN'T
NEAR AS MUCH AS FATHER COULD HAVE GOT IF HE HAD BEEN ALIVE
I HAD EXPECTED TO SEE SHERLOCK HOLMES IMPATIENT UNDER THIS
RAMBLING AND INCONSEQUENTIAL NARRATIVE BUT ON THE CONTRARY HE
HAD LISTENED WITH THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF ATTENTION
YOUR OWN LITTLE INCOME HE ASKED DOES IT COME OUT OF THE
BUSINESS
OH NO SIR
IT IS QUITE SEPARATE AND WAS LEFT ME BY MY UNCLE
NED IN AUCKLAND
IT IS IN NEW ZEALAND STOCK PAYING 4 1 2 PER
CENT
TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS WAS THE AMOUNT BUT I CAN
ONLY TOUCH THE INTEREST
YOU INTEREST ME EXTREMELY SAID HOLMES
AND SINCE YOU DRAW SO
LARGE A SUM AS A HUNDRED A YEAR WITH WHAT YOU EARN INTO THE
BARGAIN YOU NO DOUBT TRAVEL A LITTLE AND INDULGE YOURSELF IN
EVERY WAY
I BELIEVE THAT A SINGLE LADY CAN GET ON VERY NICELY
UPON AN INCOME OF ABOUT 60 POUNDS
I COULD DO WITH MUCH LESS THAN THAT MR
HOLMES BUT YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT AS LONG AS I LIVE AT HOME I DON'T WISH TO BE A
BURDEN TO THEM AND SO THEY HAVE THE USE OF THE MONEY JUST WHILE
I AM STAYING WITH THEM
OF COURSE THAT IS ONLY JUST FOR THE
TIME
MR
WINDIBANK DRAWS MY INTEREST EVERY QUARTER AND PAYS IT
OVER TO MOTHER AND I FIND THAT I CAN DO PRETTY WELL WITH WHAT I
EARN AT TYPEWRITING
IT BRINGS ME TWOPENCE A SHEET AND I CAN
OFTEN DO FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SHEETS IN A DAY
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POSITION VERY CLEAR TO ME SAID HOLMES
THIS IS MY FRIEND DR
WATSON BEFORE WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK AS
FREELY AS BEFORE MYSELF
KINDLY TELL US NOW ALL ABOUT YOUR
CONNECTION WITH MR
HOSMER ANGEL
A FLUSH STOLE OVER MISS SUTHERLAND'S FACE AND SHE PICKED
NERVOUSLY AT THE FRINGE OF HER JACKET
I MET HIM FIRST AT THE
GASFITTERS' BALL SHE SAID
THEY USED TO SEND FATHER TICKETS
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AND THEN AFTERWARDS THEY REMEMBERED US AND
SENT THEM TO MOTHER
MR
WINDIBANK DID NOT WISH US TO GO
HE
NEVER DID WISH US TO GO ANYWHERE
HE WOULD GET QUITE MAD IF I
WANTED SO MUCH AS TO JOIN A SUNDAY SCHOOL TREAT
BUT THIS TIME I
WAS SET ON GOING AND I WOULD GO FOR WHAT RIGHT HAD HE TO
PREVENT HE SAID THE FOLK WERE NOT FIT FOR US TO KNOW WHEN ALL
FATHER'S FRIENDS WERE TO BE THERE
AND HE SAID THAT I HAD NOTHING
FIT TO WEAR WHEN I HAD MY PURPLE PLUSH THAT I HAD NEVER SO MUCH
AS TAKEN OUT OF THE DRAWER
AT LAST WHEN NOTHING ELSE WOULD DO
HE WENT OFF TO FRANCE UPON THE BUSINESS OF THE FIRM BUT WE WENT
MOTHER AND I WITH MR
HARDY WHO USED TO BE OUR FOREMAN AND IT
WAS THERE I MET MR
HOSMER ANGEL
I SUPPOSE SAID HOLMES THAT WHEN MR
WINDIBANK CAME BACK FROM
FRANCE HE WAS VERY ANNOYED AT YOUR HAVING GONE TO THE BALL
OH WELL HE WAS VERY GOOD ABOUT IT
HE LAUGHED I REMEMBER AND
SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID THERE WAS NO USE DENYING
ANYTHING TO A WOMAN FOR SHE WOULD HAVE HER WAY
I SEE
THEN AT THE GASFITTERS' BALL YOU MET AS I UNDERSTAND A
GENTLEMAN CALLED MR
HOSMER ANGEL
YES SIR
I MET HIM THAT NIGHT AND HE CALLED NEXT DAY TO ASK IF
WE HAD GOT HOME ALL SAFE AND AFTER THAT WE MET HIM THAT IS TO
SAY MR
HOLMES I MET HIM TWICE FOR WALKS BUT AFTER THAT FATHER
CAME BACK AGAIN AND MR
HOSMER ANGEL COULD NOT COME TO THE HOUSE
ANY MORE
NO
WELL YOU KNOW FATHER DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING OF THE SORT
HE
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY VISITORS IF HE COULD HELP IT AND HE USED TO
SAY THAT A WOMAN SHOULD BE HAPPY IN HER OWN FAMILY CIRCLE
BUT
THEN AS I USED TO SAY TO MOTHER A WOMAN WANTS HER OWN CIRCLE TO
BEGIN WITH AND I HAD NOT GOT MINE YET
BUT HOW ABOUT MR
HOSMER ANGEL DID HE MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE
YOU
WELL FATHER WAS GOING OFF TO FRANCE AGAIN IN A WEEK AND HOSMER
WROTE AND SAID THAT IT WOULD BE SAFER AND BETTER NOT TO SEE EACH
OTHER UNTIL HE HAD GONE
WE COULD WRITE IN THE MEANTIME AND HE
USED TO WRITE EVERY DAY
I TOOK THE LETTERS IN IN THE MORNING SO
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR FATHER TO KNOW
WERE YOU ENGAGED TO THE GENTLEMAN AT THIS TIME
OH YES MR
HOLMES
WE WERE ENGAGED AFTER THE FIRST WALK THAT
WE TOOK
HOSMER MR
ANGEL WAS A CASHIER IN AN OFFICE IN
LEADENHALL STREET AND
WHAT OFFICE
THAT'S THE WORST OF IT MR
HOLMES I DON'T KNOW
WHERE DID HE LIVE THEN
HE SLEPT ON THE PREMISES
AND YOU DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS
NO EXCEPT THAT IT WAS LEADENHALL STREET
WHERE DID YOU ADDRESS YOUR LETTERS THEN
TO THE LEADENHALL STREET POST OFFICE TO BE LEFT TILL CALLED
FOR
HE SAID THAT IF THEY WERE SENT TO THE OFFICE HE WOULD BE
CHAFFED BY ALL THE OTHER CLERKS ABOUT HAVING LETTERS FROM A LADY
SO I OFFERED TO TYPEWRITE THEM LIKE HE DID HIS BUT HE WOULDN'T
HAVE THAT FOR HE SAID THAT WHEN I WROTE THEM THEY SEEMED TO COME
FROM ME BUT WHEN THEY WERE TYPEWRITTEN HE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE
MACHINE HAD COME BETWEEN US
THAT WILL JUST SHOW YOU HOW FOND HE
WAS OF ME MR
HOLMES AND THE LITTLE THINGS THAT HE WOULD THINK
OF
IT WAS MOST SUGGESTIVE SAID HOLMES
IT HAS LONG BEEN AN AXIOM
OF MINE THAT THE LITTLE THINGS ARE INFINITELY THE MOST IMPORTANT
CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY OTHER LITTLE THINGS ABOUT MR
HOSMER ANGEL
HE WAS A VERY SHY MAN MR
HOLMES
HE WOULD RATHER WALK WITH ME
IN THE EVENING THAN IN THE DAYLIGHT FOR HE SAID THAT HE HATED TO
BE CONSPICUOUS
VERY RETIRING AND GENTLEMANLY HE WAS
EVEN HIS
VOICE WAS GENTLE
HE'D HAD THE QUINSY AND SWOLLEN GLANDS WHEN HE
WAS YOUNG HE TOLD ME AND IT HAD LEFT HIM WITH A WEAK THROAT
AND A HESITATING WHISPERING FASHION OF SPEECH
HE WAS ALWAYS
WELL DRESSED VERY NEAT AND PLAIN BUT HIS EYES WERE WEAK JUST
AS MINE ARE AND HE WORE TINTED GLASSES AGAINST THE GLARE
WELL AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN MR
WINDIBANK YOUR STEPFATHER
RETURNED TO FRANCE
MR
HOSMER ANGEL CAME TO THE HOUSE AGAIN AND PROPOSED THAT WE
SHOULD MARRY BEFORE FATHER CAME BACK
HE WAS IN DREADFUL EARNEST
AND MADE ME SWEAR WITH MY HANDS ON THE TESTAMENT THAT WHATEVER
HAPPENED I WOULD ALWAYS BE TRUE TO HIM
MOTHER SAID HE WAS QUITE
RIGHT TO MAKE ME SWEAR AND THAT IT WAS A SIGN OF HIS PASSION
MOTHER WAS ALL IN HIS FAVOUR FROM THE FIRST AND WAS EVEN FONDER
OF HIM THAN I WAS
THEN WHEN THEY TALKED OF MARRYING WITHIN THE
WEEK I BEGAN TO ASK ABOUT FATHER BUT THEY BOTH SAID NEVER TO
MIND ABOUT FATHER BUT JUST TO TELL HIM AFTERWARDS AND MOTHER
SAID SHE WOULD MAKE IT ALL RIGHT WITH HIM
I DIDN'T QUITE LIKE
THAT MR
HOLMES
IT SEEMED FUNNY THAT I SHOULD ASK HIS LEAVE AS
HE WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN ME BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING ON THE SLY SO I WROTE TO FATHER AT BORDEAUX WHERE THE
COMPANY HAS ITS FRENCH OFFICES BUT THE LETTER CAME BACK TO ME ON
THE VERY MORNING OF THE WEDDING
IT MISSED HIM THEN
YES SIR FOR HE HAD STARTED TO ENGLAND JUST BEFORE IT ARRIVED
HA THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE
YOUR WEDDING WAS ARRANGED THEN FOR
THE FRIDAY
WAS IT TO BE IN CHURCH
YES SIR BUT VERY QUIETLY
IT WAS TO BE AT ST
SAVIOUR'S NEAR
KING'S CROSS AND WE WERE TO HAVE BREAKFAST AFTERWARDS AT THE ST
PANCRAS HOTEL
HOSMER CAME FOR US IN A HANSOM BUT AS THERE WERE
TWO OF US HE PUT US BOTH INTO IT AND STEPPED HIMSELF INTO A
FOUR WHEELER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE THE ONLY OTHER CAB IN THE
STREET
WE GOT TO THE CHURCH FIRST AND WHEN THE FOUR WHEELER
DROVE UP WE WAITED FOR HIM TO STEP OUT BUT HE NEVER DID AND
WHEN THE CABMAN GOT DOWN FROM THE BOX AND LOOKED THERE WAS NO ONE
THERE THE CABMAN SAID THAT HE COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT HAD BECOME
OF HIM FOR HE HAD SEEN HIM GET IN WITH HIS OWN EYES
THAT WAS
LAST FRIDAY MR
HOLMES AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING
SINCE THEN TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON WHAT BECAME OF HIM
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VERY SHAMEFULLY TREATED SAID
HOLMES
OH NO SIR HE WAS TOO GOOD AND KIND TO LEAVE ME SO
WHY ALL
THE MORNING HE WAS SAYING TO ME THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED I WAS TO
BE TRUE AND THAT EVEN IF SOMETHING QUITE UNFORESEEN OCCURRED TO
SEPARATE US I WAS ALWAYS TO REMEMBER THAT I WAS PLEDGED TO HIM
AND THAT HE WOULD CLAIM HIS PLEDGE SOONER OR LATER
IT SEEMED
STRANGE TALK FOR A WEDDING MORNING BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE
GIVES A MEANING TO IT
MOST CERTAINLY IT DOES
YOUR OWN OPINION IS THEN THAT SOME
UNFORESEEN CATASTROPHE HAS OCCURRED TO HIM
YES SIR
I BELIEVE THAT HE FORESAW SOME DANGER OR ELSE HE
WOULD NOT HAVE TALKED SO
AND THEN I THINK THAT WHAT HE FORESAW
HAPPENED
BUT YOU HAVE NO NOTION AS TO WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN
NONE
ONE MORE QUESTION
HOW DID YOUR MOTHER TAKE THE MATTER
SHE WAS ANGRY AND SAID THAT I WAS NEVER TO SPEAK OF THE MATTER
AGAIN
AND YOUR FATHER DID YOU TELL HIM
YES AND HE SEEMED TO THINK WITH ME THAT SOMETHING HAD
HAPPENED AND THAT I SHOULD HEAR OF HOSMER AGAIN
AS HE SAID
WHAT INTEREST COULD ANYONE HAVE IN BRINGING ME TO THE DOORS OF
THE CHURCH AND THEN LEAVING ME NOW IF HE HAD BORROWED MY
MONEY OR IF HE HAD MARRIED ME AND GOT MY MONEY SETTLED ON HIM
THERE MIGHT BE SOME REASON BUT HOSMER WAS VERY INDEPENDENT ABOUT
MONEY AND NEVER WOULD LOOK AT A SHILLING OF MINE
AND YET WHAT
COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND WHY COULD HE NOT WRITE OH IT DRIVES ME
HALF MAD TO THINK OF IT AND I CAN'T SLEEP A WINK AT NIGHT SHE
PULLED A LITTLE HANDKERCHIEF OUT OF HER MUFF AND BEGAN TO SOB
HEAVILY INTO IT
I SHALL GLANCE INTO THE CASE FOR YOU SAID HOLMES RISING AND
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE SHALL REACH SOME DEFINITE RESULT
LET THE
WEIGHT OF THE MATTER REST UPON ME NOW AND DO NOT LET YOUR MIND
DWELL UPON IT FURTHER
ABOVE ALL TRY TO LET MR
HOSMER ANGEL
VANISH FROM YOUR MEMORY AS HE HAS DONE FROM YOUR LIFE
THEN YOU DON'T THINK I'LL SEE HIM AGAIN
I FEAR NOT
THEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM
YOU WILL LEAVE THAT QUESTION IN MY HANDS
I SHOULD LIKE AN
ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF HIM AND ANY LETTERS OF HIS WHICH YOU CAN
SPARE
I ADVERTISED FOR HIM IN LAST SATURDAY'S CHRONICLE SAID SHE
HERE IS THE SLIP AND HERE ARE FOUR LETTERS FROM HIM
THANK YOU
AND YOUR ADDRESS
NO
31 LYON PLACE CAMBERWELL
MR
ANGEL'S ADDRESS YOU NEVER HAD I UNDERSTAND
WHERE IS YOUR
FATHER'S PLACE OF BUSINESS
HE TRAVELS FOR WESTHOUSE MARBANK THE GREAT CLARET IMPORTERS
OF FENCHURCH STREET
THANK YOU
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR STATEMENT VERY CLEARLY
YOU WILL
LEAVE THE PAPERS HERE AND REMEMBER THE ADVICE WHICH I HAVE GIVEN
YOU
LET THE WHOLE INCIDENT BE A SEALED BOOK AND DO NOT ALLOW IT
TO AFFECT YOUR LIFE
YOU ARE VERY KIND MR
HOLMES BUT I CANNOT DO THAT
I SHALL BE
TRUE TO HOSMER
HE SHALL FIND ME READY WHEN HE COMES BACK
FOR ALL THE PREPOSTEROUS HAT AND THE VACUOUS FACE THERE WAS
SOMETHING NOBLE IN THE SIMPLE FAITH OF OUR VISITOR WHICH
COMPELLED OUR RESPECT
SHE LAID HER LITTLE BUNDLE OF PAPERS UPON
THE TABLE AND WENT HER WAY WITH A PROMISE TO COME AGAIN WHENEVER
SHE MIGHT BE SUMMONED
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT SILENT FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HIS FINGERTIPS
STILL PRESSED TOGETHER HIS LEGS STRETCHED OUT IN FRONT OF HIM
AND HIS GAZE DIRECTED UPWARD TO THE CEILING
THEN HE TOOK DOWN
FROM THE RACK THE OLD AND OILY CLAY PIPE WHICH WAS TO HIM AS A
COUNSELLOR AND HAVING LIT IT HE LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH
THE THICK BLUE CLOUD WREATHS SPINNING UP FROM HIM AND A LOOK OF
INFINITE LANGUOR IN HIS FACE
QUITE AN INTERESTING STUDY THAT MAIDEN HE OBSERVED
I FOUND
HER MORE INTERESTING THAN HER LITTLE PROBLEM WHICH BY THE WAY
IS RATHER A TRITE ONE
YOU WILL FIND PARALLEL CASES IF YOU
CONSULT MY INDEX IN ANDOVER IN '77 AND THERE WAS SOMETHING OF
THE SORT AT THE HAGUE LAST YEAR
OLD AS IS THE IDEA HOWEVER
THERE WERE ONE OR TWO DETAILS WHICH WERE NEW TO ME
BUT THE
MAIDEN HERSELF WAS MOST INSTRUCTIVE
YOU APPEARED TO READ A GOOD DEAL UPON HER WHICH WAS QUITE
INVISIBLE TO ME I REMARKED
NOT INVISIBLE BUT UNNOTICED WATSON
YOU DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO
LOOK AND SO YOU MISSED ALL THAT WAS IMPORTANT
I CAN NEVER BRING
YOU TO REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF SLEEVES THE SUGGESTIVENESS OF
THUMB NAILS OR THE GREAT ISSUES THAT MAY HANG FROM A BOOT LACE
NOW WHAT DID YOU GATHER FROM THAT WOMAN'S APPEARANCE DESCRIBE
IT
WELL SHE HAD A SLATE COLOURED BROAD BRIMMED STRAW HAT WITH A
FEATHER OF A BRICKISH RED
HER JACKET WAS BLACK WITH BLACK BEADS
SEWN UPON IT AND A FRINGE OF LITTLE BLACK JET ORNAMENTS
HER
DRESS WAS BROWN RATHER DARKER THAN COFFEE COLOUR WITH A LITTLE
PURPLE PLUSH AT THE NECK AND SLEEVES
HER GLOVES WERE GREYISH AND
WERE WORN THROUGH AT THE RIGHT FOREFINGER
HER BOOTS I DIDN'T
OBSERVE
SHE HAD SMALL ROUND HANGING GOLD EARRINGS AND A
GENERAL AIR OF BEING FAIRLY WELL TO DO IN A VULGAR COMFORTABLE
EASY GOING WAY
SHERLOCK HOLMES CLAPPED HIS HANDS SOFTLY TOGETHER AND CHUCKLED
'PON MY WORD WATSON YOU ARE COMING ALONG WONDERFULLY
YOU HAVE
REALLY DONE VERY WELL INDEED
IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE MISSED
EVERYTHING OF IMPORTANCE BUT YOU HAVE HIT UPON THE METHOD AND
YOU HAVE A QUICK EYE FOR COLOUR
NEVER TRUST TO GENERAL
IMPRESSIONS MY BOY BUT CONCENTRATE YOURSELF UPON DETAILS
MY
FIRST GLANCE IS ALWAYS AT A WOMAN'S SLEEVE
IN A MAN IT IS
PERHAPS BETTER FIRST TO TAKE THE KNEE OF THE TROUSER
AS YOU
OBSERVE THIS WOMAN HAD PLUSH UPON HER SLEEVES WHICH IS A MOST
USEFUL MATERIAL FOR SHOWING TRACES
THE DOUBLE LINE A LITTLE
ABOVE THE WRIST WHERE THE TYPEWRITIST PRESSES AGAINST THE TABLE
WAS BEAUTIFULLY DEFINED
THE SEWING MACHINE OF THE HAND TYPE
LEAVES A SIMILAR MARK BUT ONLY ON THE LEFT ARM AND ON THE SIDE
OF IT FARTHEST FROM THE THUMB INSTEAD OF BEING RIGHT ACROSS THE
BROADEST PART AS THIS WAS
I THEN GLANCED AT HER FACE AND
OBSERVING THE DINT OF A PINCE NEZ AT EITHER SIDE OF HER NOSE I
VENTURED A REMARK UPON SHORT SIGHT AND TYPEWRITING WHICH SEEMED
TO SURPRISE HER
IT SURPRISED ME
BUT SURELY IT WAS OBVIOUS
I WAS THEN MUCH SURPRISED AND
INTERESTED ON GLANCING DOWN TO OBSERVE THAT THOUGH THE BOOTS
WHICH SHE WAS WEARING WERE NOT UNLIKE EACH OTHER THEY WERE
REALLY ODD ONES THE ONE HAVING A SLIGHTLY DECORATED TOE CAP AND
THE OTHER A PLAIN ONE
ONE WAS BUTTONED ONLY IN THE TWO LOWER
BUTTONS OUT OF FIVE AND THE OTHER AT THE FIRST THIRD AND
FIFTH
NOW WHEN YOU SEE THAT A YOUNG LADY OTHERWISE NEATLY
DRESSED HAS COME AWAY FROM HOME WITH ODD BOOTS HALF BUTTONED
IT IS NO GREAT DEDUCTION TO SAY THAT SHE CAME AWAY IN A HURRY
AND WHAT ELSE I ASKED KEENLY INTERESTED AS I ALWAYS WAS BY
MY FRIEND'S INCISIVE REASONING
I NOTED IN PASSING THAT SHE HAD WRITTEN A NOTE BEFORE LEAVING
HOME BUT AFTER BEING FULLY DRESSED
YOU OBSERVED THAT HER RIGHT
GLOVE WAS TORN AT THE FOREFINGER BUT YOU DID NOT APPARENTLY SEE
THAT BOTH GLOVE AND FINGER WERE STAINED WITH VIOLET INK
SHE HAD
WRITTEN IN A HURRY AND DIPPED HER PEN TOO DEEP
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THIS MORNING OR THE MARK WOULD NOT REMAIN CLEAR UPON THE FINGER
ALL THIS IS AMUSING THOUGH RATHER ELEMENTARY BUT I MUST GO BACK
TO BUSINESS WATSON
WOULD YOU MIND READING ME THE ADVERTISED
DESCRIPTION OF MR
HOSMER ANGEL
I HELD THE LITTLE PRINTED SLIP TO THE LIGHT
MISSING IT SAID ON THE MORNING OF THE FOURTEENTH A GENTLEMAN
NAMED HOSMER ANGEL
ABOUT FIVE FT
SEVEN IN
IN HEIGHT
STRONGLY BUILT SALLOW COMPLEXION BLACK HAIR A LITTLE BALD IN
THE CENTRE BUSHY BLACK SIDE WHISKERS AND MOUSTACHE TINTED
GLASSES SLIGHT INFIRMITY OF SPEECH
WAS DRESSED WHEN LAST SEEN
IN BLACK FROCK COAT FACED WITH SILK BLACK WAISTCOAT GOLD ALBERT
CHAIN AND GREY HARRIS TWEED TROUSERS WITH BROWN GAITERS OVER
ELASTIC SIDED BOOTS
KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED IN AN OFFICE IN
LEADENHALL STREET
ANYBODY BRINGING
THAT WILL DO SAID HOLMES
AS TO THE LETTERS HE CONTINUED
GLANCING OVER THEM THEY ARE VERY COMMONPLACE
ABSOLUTELY NO
CLUE IN THEM TO MR
ANGEL SAVE THAT HE QUOTES BALZAC ONCE
THERE
IS ONE REMARKABLE POINT HOWEVER WHICH WILL NO DOUBT STRIKE
YOU
THEY ARE TYPEWRITTEN I REMARKED
NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE SIGNATURE IS TYPEWRITTEN
LOOK AT THE
NEAT LITTLE 'HOSMER ANGEL' AT THE BOTTOM
THERE IS A DATE YOU
SEE BUT NO SUPERSCRIPTION EXCEPT LEADENHALL STREET WHICH IS
RATHER VAGUE
THE POINT ABOUT THE SIGNATURE IS VERY SUGGESTIVE IN
FACT WE MAY CALL IT CONCLUSIVE
OF WHAT
MY DEAR FELLOW IS IT POSSIBLE YOU DO NOT SEE HOW STRONGLY IT
BEARS UPON THE CASE
I CANNOT SAY THAT I DO UNLESS IT WERE THAT HE WISHED TO BE ABLE
TO DENY HIS SIGNATURE IF AN ACTION FOR BREACH OF PROMISE WERE
INSTITUTED
NO THAT WAS NOT THE POINT
HOWEVER I SHALL WRITE TWO LETTERS
WHICH SHOULD SETTLE THE MATTER
ONE IS TO A FIRM IN THE CITY THE
OTHER IS TO THE YOUNG LADY'S STEPFATHER MR
WINDIBANK ASKING
HIM WHETHER HE COULD MEET US HERE AT SIX O'CLOCK TOMORROW
EVENING
IT IS JUST AS WELL THAT WE SHOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THE
MALE RELATIVES
AND NOW DOCTOR WE CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL THE
ANSWERS TO THOSE LETTERS COME SO WE MAY PUT OUR LITTLE PROBLEM
UPON THE SHELF FOR THE INTERIM
I HAD HAD SO MANY REASONS TO BELIEVE IN MY FRIEND'S SUBTLE POWERS
OF REASONING AND EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY IN ACTION THAT I FELT THAT
HE MUST HAVE SOME SOLID GROUNDS FOR THE ASSURED AND EASY
DEMEANOUR WITH WHICH HE TREATED THE SINGULAR MYSTERY WHICH HE HAD
BEEN CALLED UPON TO FATHOM
ONCE ONLY HAD I KNOWN HIM TO FAIL IN
THE CASE OF THE KING OF BOHEMIA AND OF THE IRENE ADLER
PHOTOGRAPH BUT WHEN I LOOKED BACK TO THE WEIRD BUSINESS OF THE
SIGN OF FOUR AND THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH
THE STUDY IN SCARLET I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE A STRANGE TANGLE
INDEED WHICH HE COULD NOT UNRAVEL
I LEFT HIM THEN STILL PUFFING AT HIS BLACK CLAY PIPE WITH THE
CONVICTION THAT WHEN I CAME AGAIN ON THE NEXT EVENING I WOULD
FIND THAT HE HELD IN HIS HANDS ALL THE CLUES WHICH WOULD LEAD UP
TO THE IDENTITY OF THE DISAPPEARING BRIDEGROOM OF MISS MARY
SUTHERLAND
A PROFESSIONAL CASE OF GREAT GRAVITY WAS ENGAGING MY OWN
ATTENTION AT THE TIME AND THE WHOLE OF NEXT DAY I WAS BUSY AT
THE BEDSIDE OF THE SUFFERER
IT WAS NOT UNTIL CLOSE UPON SIX
O'CLOCK THAT I FOUND MYSELF FREE AND WAS ABLE TO SPRING INTO A
HANSOM AND DRIVE TO BAKER STREET HALF AFRAID THAT I MIGHT BE TOO
LATE TO ASSIST AT THE DNOUEMENT OF THE LITTLE MYSTERY
I FOUND
SHERLOCK HOLMES ALONE HOWEVER HALF ASLEEP WITH HIS LONG THIN
FORM CURLED UP IN THE RECESSES OF HIS ARMCHAIR
A FORMIDABLE
ARRAY OF BOTTLES AND TEST TUBES WITH THE PUNGENT CLEANLY SMELL
OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SPENT HIS DAY IN THE
CHEMICAL WORK WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO HIM
WELL HAVE YOU SOLVED IT I ASKED AS I ENTERED
YES
IT WAS THE BISULPHATE OF BARYTA
NO NO THE MYSTERY I CRIED
OH THAT I THOUGHT OF THE SALT THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING UPON
THERE WAS NEVER ANY MYSTERY IN THE MATTER THOUGH AS I SAID
YESTERDAY SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE OF INTEREST
THE ONLY DRAWBACK
IS THAT THERE IS NO LAW I FEAR THAT CAN TOUCH THE SCOUNDREL
WHO WAS HE THEN AND WHAT WAS HIS OBJECT IN DESERTING MISS
SUTHERLAND
THE QUESTION WAS HARDLY OUT OF MY MOUTH AND HOLMES HAD NOT YET
OPENED HIS LIPS TO REPLY WHEN WE HEARD A HEAVY FOOTFALL IN THE
PASSAGE AND A TAP AT THE DOOR
THIS IS THE GIRL'S STEPFATHER MR
JAMES WINDIBANK SAID
HOLMES
HE HAS WRITTEN TO ME TO SAY THAT HE WOULD BE HERE AT
SIX
COME IN
THE MAN WHO ENTERED WAS A STURDY MIDDLE SIZED FELLOW SOME
THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CLEAN SHAVEN AND SALLOW SKINNED WITH A
BLAND INSINUATING MANNER AND A PAIR OF WONDERFULLY SHARP AND
PENETRATING GREY EYES
HE SHOT A QUESTIONING GLANCE AT EACH OF
US PLACED HIS SHINY TOP HAT UPON THE SIDEBOARD AND WITH A
SLIGHT BOW SIDLED DOWN INTO THE NEAREST CHAIR
GOOD EVENING MR
JAMES WINDIBANK SAID HOLMES
I THINK THAT
THIS TYPEWRITTEN LETTER IS FROM YOU IN WHICH YOU MADE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH ME FOR SIX O'CLOCK
YES SIR
I AM AFRAID THAT I AM A LITTLE LATE BUT I AM NOT
QUITE MY OWN MASTER YOU KNOW
I AM SORRY THAT MISS SUTHERLAND
HAS TROUBLED YOU ABOUT THIS LITTLE MATTER FOR I THINK IT IS FAR
BETTER NOT TO WASH LINEN OF THE SORT IN PUBLIC
IT WAS QUITE
AGAINST MY WISHES THAT SHE CAME BUT SHE IS A VERY EXCITABLE
IMPULSIVE GIRL AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED AND SHE IS NOT EASILY
CONTROLLED WHEN SHE HAS MADE UP HER MIND ON A POINT
OF COURSE I
DID NOT MIND YOU SO MUCH AS YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED WITH THE
OFFICIAL POLICE BUT IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO HAVE A FAMILY
MISFORTUNE LIKE THIS NOISED ABROAD
BESIDES IT IS A USELESS
EXPENSE FOR HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY FIND THIS HOSMER ANGEL
ON THE CONTRARY SAID HOLMES QUIETLY I HAVE EVERY REASON TO
BELIEVE THAT I WILL SUCCEED IN DISCOVERING MR
HOSMER ANGEL
MR
WINDIBANK GAVE A VIOLENT START AND DROPPED HIS GLOVES
I AM
DELIGHTED TO HEAR IT HE SAID
IT IS A CURIOUS THING REMARKED HOLMES THAT A TYPEWRITER HAS
REALLY QUITE AS MUCH INDIVIDUALITY AS A MAN'S HANDWRITING
UNLESS
THEY ARE QUITE NEW NO TWO OF THEM WRITE EXACTLY ALIKE
SOME
LETTERS GET MORE WORN THAN OTHERS AND SOME WEAR ONLY ON ONE
SIDE
NOW YOU REMARK IN THIS NOTE OF YOURS MR
WINDIBANK THAT
IN EVERY CASE THERE IS SOME LITTLE SLURRING OVER OF THE 'E AND
A SLIGHT DEFECT IN THE TAIL OF THE 'R THERE ARE FOURTEEN OTHER
CHARACTERISTICS BUT THOSE ARE THE MORE OBVIOUS
WE DO ALL OUR CORRESPONDENCE WITH THIS MACHINE AT THE OFFICE
AND NO DOUBT IT IS A LITTLE WORN OUR VISITOR ANSWERED GLANCING
KEENLY AT HOLMES WITH HIS BRIGHT LITTLE EYES
AND NOW I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT IS REALLY A VERY INTERESTING STUDY
MR
WINDIBANK HOLMES CONTINUED
I THINK OF WRITING ANOTHER
LITTLE MONOGRAPH SOME OF THESE DAYS ON THE TYPEWRITER AND ITS
RELATION TO CRIME
IT IS A SUBJECT TO WHICH I HAVE DEVOTED SOME
LITTLE ATTENTION
I HAVE HERE FOUR LETTERS WHICH PURPORT TO COME
FROM THE MISSING MAN
THEY ARE ALL TYPEWRITTEN
IN EACH CASE NOT
ONLY ARE THE 'E'S' SLURRED AND THE 'R'S' TAILLESS BUT YOU WILL
OBSERVE IF YOU CARE TO USE MY MAGNIFYING LENS THAT THE FOURTEEN
OTHER CHARACTERISTICS TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED ARE THERE AS WELL
MR
WINDIBANK SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR AND PICKED UP HIS HAT
I
CANNOT WASTE TIME OVER THIS SORT OF FANTASTIC TALK MR
HOLMES
HE SAID
IF YOU CAN CATCH THE MAN CATCH HIM AND LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE DONE IT
CERTAINLY SAID HOLMES STEPPING OVER AND TURNING THE KEY IN
THE DOOR
I LET YOU KNOW THEN THAT I HAVE CAUGHT HIM
WHAT WHERE SHOUTED MR
WINDIBANK TURNING WHITE TO HIS LIPS
AND GLANCING ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP
OH IT WON'T DO REALLY IT WON'T SAID HOLMES SUAVELY
THERE
IS NO POSSIBLE GETTING OUT OF IT MR
WINDIBANK
IT IS QUITE TOO
TRANSPARENT AND IT WAS A VERY BAD COMPLIMENT WHEN YOU SAID THAT
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SOLVE SO SIMPLE A QUESTION
THAT'S
RIGHT SIT DOWN AND LET US TALK IT OVER
OUR VISITOR COLLAPSED INTO A CHAIR WITH A GHASTLY FACE AND A
GLITTER OF MOISTURE ON HIS BROW
IT IT'S NOT ACTIONABLE HE
STAMMERED
I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THAT IT IS NOT
BUT BETWEEN OURSELVES
WINDIBANK IT WAS AS CRUEL AND SELFISH AND HEARTLESS A TRICK IN A
PETTY WAY AS EVER CAME BEFORE ME
NOW LET ME JUST RUN OVER THE
COURSE OF EVENTS AND YOU WILL CONTRADICT ME IF I GO WRONG
THE MAN SAT HUDDLED UP IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS
BREAST LIKE ONE WHO IS UTTERLY CRUSHED
HOLMES STUCK HIS FEET UP
ON THE CORNER OF THE MANTELPIECE AND LEANING BACK WITH HIS HANDS
IN HIS POCKETS BEGAN TALKING RATHER TO HIMSELF AS IT SEEMED
THAN TO US
THE MAN MARRIED A WOMAN VERY MUCH OLDER THAN HIMSELF FOR HER
MONEY SAID HE AND HE ENJOYED THE USE OF THE MONEY OF THE
DAUGHTER AS LONG AS SHE LIVED WITH THEM
IT WAS A CONSIDERABLE
SUM FOR PEOPLE IN THEIR POSITION AND THE LOSS OF IT WOULD HAVE
MADE A SERIOUS DIFFERENCE
IT WAS WORTH AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE IT
THE DAUGHTER WAS OF A GOOD AMIABLE DISPOSITION BUT AFFECTIONATE
AND WARM HEARTED IN HER WAYS SO THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WITH
HER FAIR PERSONAL ADVANTAGES AND HER LITTLE INCOME SHE WOULD
NOT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN SINGLE LONG
NOW HER MARRIAGE WOULD
MEAN OF COURSE THE LOSS OF A HUNDRED A YEAR SO WHAT DOES HER
STEPFATHER DO TO PREVENT IT HE TAKES THE OBVIOUS COURSE OF
KEEPING HER AT HOME AND FORBIDDING HER TO SEEK THE COMPANY OF
PEOPLE OF HER OWN AGE
BUT SOON HE FOUND THAT THAT WOULD NOT
ANSWER FOREVER
SHE BECAME RESTIVE INSISTED UPON HER RIGHTS AND
FINALLY ANNOUNCED HER POSITIVE INTENTION OF GOING TO A CERTAIN
BALL
WHAT DOES HER CLEVER STEPFATHER DO THEN HE CONCEIVES AN
IDEA MORE CREDITABLE TO HIS HEAD THAN TO HIS HEART
WITH THE
CONNIVANCE AND ASSISTANCE OF HIS WIFE HE DISGUISED HIMSELF
COVERED THOSE KEEN EYES WITH TINTED GLASSES MASKED THE FACE WITH
A MOUSTACHE AND A PAIR OF BUSHY WHISKERS SUNK THAT CLEAR VOICE
INTO AN INSINUATING WHISPER AND DOUBLY SECURE ON ACCOUNT OF THE
GIRL'S SHORT SIGHT HE APPEARS AS MR
HOSMER ANGEL AND KEEPS OFF
OTHER LOVERS BY MAKING LOVE HIMSELF
IT WAS ONLY A JOKE AT FIRST GROANED OUR VISITOR
WE NEVER
THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN SO CARRIED AWAY
VERY LIKELY NOT
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE THE YOUNG LADY WAS VERY
DECIDEDLY CARRIED AWAY AND HAVING QUITE MADE UP HER MIND THAT
HER STEPFATHER WAS IN FRANCE THE SUSPICION OF TREACHERY NEVER
FOR AN INSTANT ENTERED HER MIND
SHE WAS FLATTERED BY THE
GENTLEMAN'S ATTENTIONS AND THE EFFECT WAS INCREASED BY THE
LOUDLY EXPRESSED ADMIRATION OF HER MOTHER
THEN MR
ANGEL BEGAN
TO CALL FOR IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE MATTER SHOULD BE PUSHED AS
FAR AS IT WOULD GO IF A REAL EFFECT WERE TO BE PRODUCED
THERE
WERE MEETINGS AND AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH WOULD FINALLY SECURE THE
GIRL'S AFFECTIONS FROM TURNING TOWARDS ANYONE ELSE
BUT THE
DECEPTION COULD NOT BE KEPT UP FOREVER
THESE PRETENDED JOURNEYS
TO FRANCE WERE RATHER CUMBROUS
THE THING TO DO WAS CLEARLY TO
BRING THE BUSINESS TO AN END IN SUCH A DRAMATIC MANNER THAT IT
WOULD LEAVE A PERMANENT IMPRESSION UPON THE YOUNG LADY'S MIND AND
PREVENT HER FROM LOOKING UPON ANY OTHER SUITOR FOR SOME TIME TO
COME
HENCE THOSE VOWS OF FIDELITY EXACTED UPON A TESTAMENT AND
HENCE ALSO THE ALLUSIONS TO A POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING HAPPENING
ON THE VERY MORNING OF THE WEDDING
JAMES WINDIBANK WISHED MISS
SUTHERLAND TO BE SO BOUND TO HOSMER ANGEL AND SO UNCERTAIN AS TO
HIS FATE THAT FOR TEN YEARS TO COME AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT
LISTEN TO ANOTHER MAN
AS FAR AS THE CHURCH DOOR HE BROUGHT HER
AND THEN AS HE COULD GO NO FARTHER HE CONVENIENTLY VANISHED
AWAY BY THE OLD TRICK OF STEPPING IN AT ONE DOOR OF A
FOUR WHEELER AND OUT AT THE OTHER
I THINK THAT WAS THE CHAIN OF
EVENTS MR
WINDIBANK
OUR VISITOR HAD RECOVERED SOMETHING OF HIS ASSURANCE WHILE HOLMES
HAD BEEN TALKING AND HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR NOW WITH A COLD
SNEER UPON HIS PALE FACE
IT MAY BE SO OR IT MAY NOT MR
HOLMES SAID HE BUT IF YOU
ARE SO VERY SHARP YOU OUGHT TO BE SHARP ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT IT IS
YOU WHO ARE BREAKING THE LAW NOW AND NOT ME
I HAVE DONE NOTHING
ACTIONABLE FROM THE FIRST BUT AS LONG AS YOU KEEP THAT DOOR
LOCKED YOU LAY YOURSELF OPEN TO AN ACTION FOR ASSAULT AND ILLEGAL
CONSTRAINT
THE LAW CANNOT AS YOU SAY TOUCH YOU SAID HOLMES UNLOCKING
AND THROWING OPEN THE DOOR YET THERE NEVER WAS A MAN WHO
DESERVED PUNISHMENT MORE
IF THE YOUNG LADY HAS A BROTHER OR A
FRIEND HE OUGHT TO LAY A WHIP ACROSS YOUR SHOULDERS
BY JOVE
HE CONTINUED FLUSHING UP AT THE SIGHT OF THE BITTER SNEER UPON
THE MAN'S FACE IT IS NOT PART OF MY DUTIES TO MY CLIENT BUT
HERE'S A HUNTING CROP HANDY AND I THINK I SHALL JUST TREAT
MYSELF TO HE TOOK TWO SWIFT STEPS TO THE WHIP BUT BEFORE HE
COULD GRASP IT THERE WAS A WILD CLATTER OF STEPS UPON THE STAIRS
THE HEAVY HALL DOOR BANGED AND FROM THE WINDOW WE COULD SEE MR
JAMES WINDIBANK RUNNING AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED DOWN THE ROAD
THERE'S A COLD BLOODED SCOUNDREL SAID HOLMES LAUGHING AS HE
THREW HIMSELF DOWN INTO HIS CHAIR ONCE MORE
THAT FELLOW WILL
RISE FROM CRIME TO CRIME UNTIL HE DOES SOMETHING VERY BAD AND
ENDS ON A GALLOWS
THE CASE HAS IN SOME RESPECTS BEEN NOT
ENTIRELY DEVOID OF INTEREST
I CANNOT NOW ENTIRELY SEE ALL THE STEPS OF YOUR REASONING I
REMARKED
WELL OF COURSE IT WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST THAT THIS MR
HOSMER ANGEL MUST HAVE SOME STRONG OBJECT FOR HIS CURIOUS
CONDUCT AND IT WAS EQUALLY CLEAR THAT THE ONLY MAN WHO REALLY
PROFITED BY THE INCIDENT AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE WAS THE
STEPFATHER
THEN THE FACT THAT THE TWO MEN WERE NEVER TOGETHER
BUT THAT THE ONE ALWAYS APPEARED WHEN THE OTHER WAS AWAY WAS
SUGGESTIVE
SO WERE THE TINTED SPECTACLES AND THE CURIOUS VOICE
WHICH BOTH HINTED AT A DISGUISE AS DID THE BUSHY WHISKERS
MY
SUSPICIONS WERE ALL CONFIRMED BY HIS PECULIAR ACTION IN
TYPEWRITING HIS SIGNATURE WHICH OF COURSE INFERRED THAT HIS
HANDWRITING WAS SO FAMILIAR TO HER THAT SHE WOULD RECOGNISE EVEN
THE SMALLEST SAMPLE OF IT
YOU SEE ALL THESE ISOLATED FACTS
TOGETHER WITH MANY MINOR ONES ALL POINTED IN THE SAME
DIRECTION
AND HOW DID YOU VERIFY THEM
HAVING ONCE SPOTTED MY MAN IT WAS EASY TO GET CORROBORATION
I
KNEW THE FIRM FOR WHICH THIS MAN WORKED
HAVING TAKEN THE PRINTED
DESCRIPTION
I ELIMINATED EVERYTHING FROM IT WHICH COULD BE THE
RESULT OF A DISGUISE THE WHISKERS THE GLASSES THE VOICE AND I
SENT IT TO THE FIRM WITH A REQUEST THAT THEY WOULD INFORM ME
WHETHER IT ANSWERED TO THE DESCRIPTION OF ANY OF THEIR
TRAVELLERS
I HAD ALREADY NOTICED THE PECULIARITIES OF THE
TYPEWRITER AND I WROTE TO THE MAN HIMSELF AT HIS BUSINESS
ADDRESS ASKING HIM IF HE WOULD COME HERE
AS I EXPECTED HIS
REPLY WAS TYPEWRITTEN AND REVEALED THE SAME TRIVIAL BUT
CHARACTERISTIC DEFECTS
THE SAME POST BROUGHT ME A LETTER FROM
WESTHOUSE MARBANK OF FENCHURCH STREET TO SAY THAT THE
DESCRIPTION TALLIED IN EVERY RESPECT WITH THAT OF THEIR EMPLOY
JAMES WINDIBANK
VOIL TOUT
AND MISS SUTHERLAND
IF I TELL HER SHE WILL NOT BELIEVE ME
YOU MAY REMEMBER THE OLD
PERSIAN SAYING 'THERE IS DANGER FOR HIM WHO TAKETH THE TIGER
CUB AND DANGER ALSO FOR WHOSO SNATCHES A DELUSION FROM A WOMAN
THERE IS AS MUCH SENSE IN HAFIZ AS IN HORACE AND AS MUCH
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
ADVENTURE IV
THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
WE WERE SEATED AT BREAKFAST ONE MORNING MY WIFE AND I WHEN THE
MAID BROUGHT IN A TELEGRAM
IT WAS FROM SHERLOCK HOLMES AND RAN
IN THIS WAY
HAVE YOU A COUPLE OF DAYS TO SPARE HAVE JUST BEEN WIRED FOR FROM
THE WEST OF ENGLAND IN CONNECTION WITH BOSCOMBE VALLEY TRAGEDY
SHALL BE GLAD IF YOU WILL COME WITH ME
AIR AND SCENERY PERFECT
LEAVE PADDINGTON BY THE 11 15
WHAT DO YOU SAY DEAR SAID MY WIFE LOOKING ACROSS AT ME
WILL YOU GO
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
I HAVE A FAIRLY LONG LIST AT
PRESENT
OH ANSTRUTHER WOULD DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU
YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING
A LITTLE PALE LATELY
I THINK THAT THE CHANGE WOULD DO YOU GOOD
AND YOU ARE ALWAYS SO INTERESTED IN MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES' CASES
I SHOULD BE UNGRATEFUL IF I WERE NOT SEEING WHAT I GAINED
THROUGH ONE OF THEM I ANSWERED
BUT IF I AM TO GO I MUST PACK
AT ONCE FOR I HAVE ONLY HALF AN HOUR
MY EXPERIENCE OF CAMP LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN HAD AT LEAST HAD THE
EFFECT OF MAKING ME A PROMPT AND READY TRAVELLER
MY WANTS WERE
FEW AND SIMPLE SO THAT IN LESS THAN THE TIME STATED I WAS IN A
CAB WITH MY VALISE RATTLING AWAY TO PADDINGTON STATION
SHERLOCK
HOLMES WAS PACING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM HIS TALL GAUNT
FIGURE MADE EVEN GAUNTER AND TALLER BY HIS LONG GREY
TRAVELLING CLOAK AND CLOSE FITTING CLOTH CAP
IT IS REALLY VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME WATSON SAID HE
IT
MAKES A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE TO ME HAVING SOMEONE WITH ME ON
WHOM I CAN THOROUGHLY RELY
LOCAL AID IS ALWAYS EITHER WORTHLESS
OR ELSE BIASSED
IF YOU WILL KEEP THE TWO CORNER SEATS I SHALL
GET THE TICKETS
WE HAD THE CARRIAGE TO OURSELVES SAVE FOR AN IMMENSE LITTER OF
PAPERS WHICH HOLMES HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM
AMONG THESE HE RUMMAGED
AND READ WITH INTERVALS OF NOTE TAKING AND OF MEDITATION UNTIL
WE WERE PAST READING
THEN HE SUDDENLY ROLLED THEM ALL INTO A
GIGANTIC BALL AND TOSSED THEM UP ONTO THE RACK
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING OF THE CASE HE ASKED
NOT A WORD
I HAVE NOT SEEN A PAPER FOR SOME DAYS
THE LONDON PRESS HAS NOT HAD VERY FULL ACCOUNTS
I HAVE JUST
BEEN LOOKING THROUGH ALL THE RECENT PAPERS IN ORDER TO MASTER THE
PARTICULARS
IT SEEMS FROM WHAT I GATHER TO BE ONE OF THOSE
SIMPLE CASES WHICH ARE SO EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE PARADOXICAL
BUT IT IS PROFOUNDLY TRUE
SINGULARITY IS ALMOST INVARIABLY A
CLUE
THE MORE FEATURELESS AND COMMONPLACE A CRIME IS THE MORE
DIFFICULT IT IS TO BRING IT HOME
IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THEY
HAVE ESTABLISHED A VERY SERIOUS CASE AGAINST THE SON OF THE
MURDERED MAN
IT IS A MURDER THEN
WELL IT IS CONJECTURED TO BE SO
I SHALL TAKE NOTHING FOR
GRANTED UNTIL I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF LOOKING PERSONALLY INTO
IT
I WILL EXPLAIN THE STATE OF THINGS TO YOU AS FAR AS I HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT IN A VERY FEW WORDS
BOSCOMBE VALLEY IS A COUNTRY DISTRICT NOT VERY FAR FROM ROSS IN
HEREFORDSHIRE
THE LARGEST LANDED PROPRIETOR IN THAT PART IS A
MR
JOHN TURNER WHO MADE HIS MONEY IN AUSTRALIA AND RETURNED
SOME YEARS AGO TO THE OLD COUNTRY
ONE OF THE FARMS WHICH HE
HELD THAT OF HATHERLEY WAS LET TO MR
CHARLES MCCARTHY WHO WAS
ALSO AN EX AUSTRALIAN
THE MEN HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER IN THE
COLONIES SO THAT IT WAS NOT UNNATURAL THAT WHEN THEY CAME TO
SETTLE DOWN THEY SHOULD DO SO AS NEAR EACH OTHER AS POSSIBLE
TURNER WAS APPARENTLY THE RICHER MAN SO MCCARTHY BECAME HIS
TENANT BUT STILL REMAINED IT SEEMS UPON TERMS OF PERFECT
EQUALITY AS THEY WERE FREQUENTLY TOGETHER
MCCARTHY HAD ONE SON
A LAD OF EIGHTEEN AND TURNER HAD AN ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE SAME
AGE BUT NEITHER OF THEM HAD WIVES LIVING
THEY APPEAR TO HAVE
AVOIDED THE SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURING ENGLISH FAMILIES AND TO
HAVE LED RETIRED LIVES THOUGH BOTH THE MCCARTHYS WERE FOND OF
SPORT AND WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN AT THE RACE MEETINGS OF THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD
MCCARTHY KEPT TWO SERVANTS A MAN AND A GIRL
TURNER HAD A CONSIDERABLE HOUSEHOLD SOME HALF DOZEN AT THE
LEAST
THAT IS AS MUCH AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER ABOUT THE
FAMILIES
NOW FOR THE FACTS
ON JUNE 3RD THAT IS ON MONDAY LAST MCCARTHY LEFT HIS HOUSE AT
HATHERLEY ABOUT THREE IN THE AFTERNOON AND WALKED DOWN TO THE
BOSCOMBE POOL WHICH IS A SMALL LAKE FORMED BY THE SPREADING OUT
OF THE STREAM WHICH RUNS DOWN THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY
HE HAD BEEN
OUT WITH HIS SERVING MAN IN THE MORNING AT ROSS AND HE HAD TOLD
THE MAN THAT HE MUST HURRY AS HE HAD AN APPOINTMENT OF
IMPORTANCE TO KEEP AT THREE
FROM THAT APPOINTMENT HE NEVER CAME
BACK ALIVE
FROM HATHERLEY FARM HOUSE TO THE BOSCOMBE POOL IS A QUARTER OF A
MILE AND TWO PEOPLE SAW HIM AS HE PASSED OVER THIS GROUND
ONE
WAS AN OLD WOMAN WHOSE NAME IS NOT MENTIONED AND THE OTHER WAS
WILLIAM CROWDER A GAME KEEPER IN THE EMPLOY OF MR
TURNER
BOTH
THESE WITNESSES DEPOSE THAT MR
MCCARTHY WAS WALKING ALONE
THE
GAME KEEPER ADDS THAT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF HIS SEEING MR
MCCARTHY PASS HE HAD SEEN HIS SON MR
JAMES MCCARTHY GOING THE
SAME WAY WITH A GUN UNDER HIS ARM
TO THE BEST OF HIS BELIEF THE
FATHER WAS ACTUALLY IN SIGHT AT THE TIME AND THE SON WAS
FOLLOWING HIM
HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER UNTIL HE HEARD IN
THE EVENING OF THE TRAGEDY THAT HAD OCCURRED
THE TWO MCCARTHYS WERE SEEN AFTER THE TIME WHEN WILLIAM CROWDER
THE GAME KEEPER LOST SIGHT OF THEM
THE BOSCOMBE POOL IS THICKLY
WOODED ROUND WITH JUST A FRINGE OF GRASS AND OF REEDS ROUND THE
EDGE
A GIRL OF FOURTEEN PATIENCE MORAN WHO IS THE DAUGHTER OF
THE LODGE KEEPER OF THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY ESTATE WAS IN ONE OF THE
WOODS PICKING FLOWERS
SHE STATES THAT WHILE SHE WAS THERE SHE
SAW AT THE BORDER OF THE WOOD AND CLOSE BY THE LAKE MR
MCCARTHY AND HIS SON AND THAT THEY APPEARED TO BE HAVING A
VIOLENT QUARREL
SHE HEARD MR
MCCARTHY THE ELDER USING VERY
STRONG LANGUAGE TO HIS SON AND SHE SAW THE LATTER RAISE UP HIS
HAND AS IF TO STRIKE HIS FATHER
SHE WAS SO FRIGHTENED BY THEIR
VIOLENCE THAT SHE RAN AWAY AND TOLD HER MOTHER WHEN SHE REACHED
HOME THAT SHE HAD LEFT THE TWO MCCARTHYS QUARRELLING NEAR
BOSCOMBE POOL AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
FIGHT
SHE HAD HARDLY SAID THE WORDS WHEN YOUNG MR
MCCARTHY CAME
RUNNING UP TO THE LODGE TO SAY THAT HE HAD FOUND HIS FATHER DEAD
IN THE WOOD AND TO ASK FOR THE HELP OF THE LODGE KEEPER
HE WAS
MUCH EXCITED WITHOUT EITHER HIS GUN OR HIS HAT AND HIS RIGHT
HAND AND SLEEVE WERE OBSERVED TO BE STAINED WITH FRESH BLOOD
ON
FOLLOWING HIM THEY FOUND THE DEAD BODY STRETCHED OUT UPON THE
GRASS BESIDE THE POOL
THE HEAD HAD BEEN BEATEN IN BY REPEATED
BLOWS OF SOME HEAVY AND BLUNT WEAPON
THE INJURIES WERE SUCH AS
MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BEEN INFLICTED BY THE BUTT END OF HIS SON'S
GUN WHICH WAS FOUND LYING ON THE GRASS WITHIN A FEW PACES OF THE
BODY
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE YOUNG MAN WAS INSTANTLY
ARRESTED AND A VERDICT OF 'WILFUL MURDER' HAVING BEEN RETURNED
AT THE INQUEST ON TUESDAY HE WAS ON WEDNESDAY BROUGHT BEFORE THE
MAGISTRATES AT ROSS WHO HAVE REFERRED THE CASE TO THE NEXT
ASSIZES
THOSE ARE THE MAIN FACTS OF THE CASE AS THEY CAME OUT
BEFORE THE CORONER AND THE POLICE COURT
I COULD HARDLY IMAGINE A MORE DAMNING CASE I REMARKED
IF
EVER CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE POINTED TO A CRIMINAL IT DOES SO
HERE
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IS A VERY TRICKY THING ANSWERED HOLMES
THOUGHTFULLY
IT MAY SEEM TO POINT VERY STRAIGHT TO ONE THING
BUT IF YOU SHIFT YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW A LITTLE YOU MAY FIND IT
POINTING IN AN EQUALLY UNCOMPROMISING MANNER TO SOMETHING
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
IT MUST BE CONFESSED HOWEVER THAT THE CASE
LOOKS EXCEEDINGLY GRAVE AGAINST THE YOUNG MAN AND IT IS VERY
POSSIBLE THAT HE IS INDEED THE CULPRIT
THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HOWEVER AND AMONG THEM MISS TURNER THE
DAUGHTER OF THE NEIGHBOURING LANDOWNER WHO BELIEVE IN HIS
INNOCENCE AND WHO HAVE RETAINED LESTRADE WHOM YOU MAY RECOLLECT
IN CONNECTION WITH THE STUDY IN SCARLET TO WORK OUT THE CASE IN
HIS INTEREST
LESTRADE BEING RATHER PUZZLED HAS REFERRED THE
CASE TO ME AND HENCE IT IS THAT TWO MIDDLE AGED GENTLEMEN ARE
FLYING WESTWARD AT FIFTY MILES AN HOUR INSTEAD OF QUIETLY
DIGESTING THEIR BREAKFASTS AT HOME
I AM AFRAID SAID I THAT THE FACTS ARE SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU
WILL FIND LITTLE CREDIT TO BE GAINED OUT OF THIS CASE
THERE IS NOTHING MORE DECEPTIVE THAN AN OBVIOUS FACT HE
ANSWERED LAUGHING
BESIDES WE MAY CHANCE TO HIT UPON SOME
OTHER OBVIOUS FACTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN BY NO MEANS OBVIOUS TO
MR
LESTRADE
YOU KNOW ME TOO WELL TO THINK THAT I AM BOASTING
WHEN I SAY THAT I SHALL EITHER CONFIRM OR DESTROY HIS THEORY BY
MEANS WHICH HE IS QUITE INCAPABLE OF EMPLOYING OR EVEN OF
UNDERSTANDING
TO TAKE THE FIRST EXAMPLE TO HAND I VERY CLEARLY
PERCEIVE THAT IN YOUR BEDROOM THE WINDOW IS UPON THE RIGHT HAND
SIDE AND YET I QUESTION WHETHER MR
LESTRADE WOULD HAVE NOTED
EVEN SO SELF EVIDENT A THING AS THAT
HOW ON EARTH
MY DEAR FELLOW I KNOW YOU WELL
I KNOW THE MILITARY NEATNESS
WHICH CHARACTERISES YOU
YOU SHAVE EVERY MORNING AND IN THIS
SEASON YOU SHAVE BY THE SUNLIGHT BUT SINCE YOUR SHAVING IS LESS
AND LESS COMPLETE AS WE GET FARTHER BACK ON THE LEFT SIDE UNTIL
IT BECOMES POSITIVELY SLOVENLY AS WE GET ROUND THE ANGLE OF THE
JAW IT IS SURELY VERY CLEAR THAT THAT SIDE IS LESS ILLUMINATED
THAN THE OTHER
I COULD NOT IMAGINE A MAN OF YOUR HABITS LOOKING
AT HIMSELF IN AN EQUAL LIGHT AND BEING SATISFIED WITH SUCH A
RESULT
I ONLY QUOTE THIS AS A TRIVIAL EXAMPLE OF OBSERVATION AND
INFERENCE
THEREIN LIES MY MTIER AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT
IT MAY BE OF SOME SERVICE IN THE INVESTIGATION WHICH LIES BEFORE
US
THERE ARE ONE OR TWO MINOR POINTS WHICH WERE BROUGHT OUT IN
THE INQUEST AND WHICH ARE WORTH CONSIDERING
WHAT ARE THEY
IT APPEARS THAT HIS ARREST DID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ONCE BUT AFTER
THE RETURN TO HATHERLEY FARM
ON THE INSPECTOR OF CONSTABULARY
INFORMING HIM THAT HE WAS A PRISONER HE REMARKED THAT HE WAS NOT
SURPRISED TO HEAR IT AND THAT IT WAS NO MORE THAN HIS DESERTS
THIS OBSERVATION OF HIS HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT OF REMOVING ANY
TRACES OF DOUBT WHICH MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THE MINDS OF THE
CORONER'S JURY
IT WAS A CONFESSION I EJACULATED
NO FOR IT WAS FOLLOWED BY A PROTESTATION OF INNOCENCE
COMING ON THE TOP OF SUCH A DAMNING SERIES OF EVENTS IT WAS AT
LEAST A MOST SUSPICIOUS REMARK
ON THE CONTRARY SAID HOLMES IT IS THE BRIGHTEST RIFT WHICH I
CAN AT PRESENT SEE IN THE CLOUDS
HOWEVER INNOCENT HE MIGHT BE
HE COULD NOT BE SUCH AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE AS NOT TO SEE THAT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE VERY BLACK AGAINST HIM
HAD HE APPEARED
SURPRISED AT HIS OWN ARREST OR FEIGNED INDIGNATION AT IT I
SHOULD HAVE LOOKED UPON IT AS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS BECAUSE SUCH
SURPRISE OR ANGER WOULD NOT BE NATURAL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND YET MIGHT APPEAR TO BE THE BEST POLICY TO A SCHEMING MAN
HIS
FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF THE SITUATION MARKS HIM AS EITHER AN INNOCENT
MAN OR ELSE AS A MAN OF CONSIDERABLE SELF RESTRAINT AND
FIRMNESS
AS TO HIS REMARK ABOUT HIS DESERTS IT WAS ALSO NOT
UNNATURAL IF YOU CONSIDER THAT HE STOOD BESIDE THE DEAD BODY OF
HIS FATHER AND THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HE HAD THAT VERY DAY
SO FAR FORGOTTEN HIS FILIAL DUTY AS TO BANDY WORDS WITH HIM AND
EVEN ACCORDING TO THE LITTLE GIRL WHOSE EVIDENCE IS SO
IMPORTANT TO RAISE HIS HAND AS IF TO STRIKE HIM
THE
SELF REPROACH AND CONTRITION WHICH ARE DISPLAYED IN HIS REMARK
APPEAR TO ME TO BE THE SIGNS OF A HEALTHY MIND RATHER THAN OF A
GUILTY ONE
I SHOOK MY HEAD
MANY MEN HAVE BEEN HANGED ON FAR SLIGHTER
EVIDENCE I REMARKED
SO THEY HAVE
AND MANY MEN HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY HANGED
WHAT IS THE YOUNG MAN'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE MATTER
IT IS I AM AFRAID NOT VERY ENCOURAGING TO HIS SUPPORTERS
THOUGH THERE ARE ONE OR TWO POINTS IN IT WHICH ARE SUGGESTIVE
YOU WILL FIND IT HERE AND MAY READ IT FOR YOURSELF
HE PICKED OUT FROM HIS BUNDLE A COPY OF THE LOCAL HEREFORDSHIRE
PAPER AND HAVING TURNED DOWN THE SHEET HE POINTED OUT THE
PARAGRAPH IN WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN HAD GIVEN HIS OWN
STATEMENT OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED
I SETTLED MYSELF DOWN IN THE
CORNER OF THE CARRIAGE AND READ IT VERY CAREFULLY
IT RAN IN THIS
WAY
MR
JAMES MCCARTHY THE ONLY SON OF THE DECEASED WAS THEN CALLED
AND GAVE EVIDENCE AS FOLLOWS 'I HAD BEEN AWAY FROM HOME FOR
THREE DAYS AT BRISTOL AND HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED UPON THE
MORNING OF LAST MONDAY THE 3RD
MY FATHER WAS ABSENT FROM HOME AT
THE TIME OF MY ARRIVAL AND I WAS INFORMED BY THE MAID THAT HE
HAD DRIVEN OVER TO ROSS WITH JOHN COBB THE GROOM
SHORTLY AFTER
MY RETURN I HEARD THE WHEELS OF HIS TRAP IN THE YARD AND
LOOKING OUT OF MY WINDOW I SAW HIM GET OUT AND WALK RAPIDLY OUT
OF THE YARD THOUGH I WAS NOT AWARE IN WHICH DIRECTION HE WAS
GOING
I THEN TOOK MY GUN AND STROLLED OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF
THE BOSCOMBE POOL WITH THE INTENTION OF VISITING THE RABBIT
WARREN WHICH IS UPON THE OTHER SIDE
ON MY WAY I SAW WILLIAM
CROWDER THE GAME KEEPER AS HE HAD STATED IN HIS EVIDENCE BUT
HE IS MISTAKEN IN THINKING THAT I WAS FOLLOWING MY FATHER
I HAD
NO IDEA THAT HE WAS IN FRONT OF ME
WHEN ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS
FROM THE POOL I HEARD A CRY OF COOEE WHICH WAS A USUAL SIGNAL
BETWEEN MY FATHER AND MYSELF
I THEN HURRIED FORWARD AND FOUND
HIM STANDING BY THE POOL
HE APPEARED TO BE MUCH SURPRISED AT
SEEING ME AND ASKED ME RATHER ROUGHLY WHAT I WAS DOING THERE
A
CONVERSATION ENSUED WHICH LED TO HIGH WORDS AND ALMOST TO BLOWS
FOR MY FATHER WAS A MAN OF A VERY VIOLENT TEMPER
SEEING THAT HIS
PASSION WAS BECOMING UNGOVERNABLE I LEFT HIM AND RETURNED
TOWARDS HATHERLEY FARM
I HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN 150 YARDS
HOWEVER WHEN I HEARD A HIDEOUS OUTCRY BEHIND ME WHICH CAUSED ME
TO RUN BACK AGAIN
I FOUND MY FATHER EXPIRING UPON THE GROUND
WITH HIS HEAD TERRIBLY INJURED
I DROPPED MY GUN AND HELD HIM IN
MY ARMS BUT HE ALMOST INSTANTLY EXPIRED
I KNELT BESIDE HIM FOR
SOME MINUTES AND THEN MADE MY WAY TO MR
TURNER'S LODGE KEEPER
HIS HOUSE BEING THE NEAREST TO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE
I SAW NO ONE
NEAR MY FATHER WHEN I RETURNED AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE CAME BY
HIS INJURIES
HE WAS NOT A POPULAR MAN BEING SOMEWHAT COLD AND
FORBIDDING IN HIS MANNERS BUT HE HAD AS FAR AS I KNOW NO
ACTIVE ENEMIES
I KNOW NOTHING FURTHER OF THE MATTER
THE CORONER DID YOUR FATHER MAKE ANY STATEMENT TO YOU BEFORE
HE DIED
WITNESS HE MUMBLED A FEW WORDS BUT I COULD ONLY CATCH SOME
ALLUSION TO A RAT
THE CORONER WHAT DID YOU UNDERSTAND BY THAT
WITNESS IT CONVEYED NO MEANING TO ME
I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS
DELIRIOUS
THE CORONER WHAT WAS THE POINT UPON WHICH YOU AND YOUR FATHER
HAD THIS FINAL QUARREL
WITNESS I SHOULD PREFER NOT TO ANSWER
THE CORONER I AM AFRAID THAT I MUST PRESS IT
WITNESS IT IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL YOU
I CAN
ASSURE YOU THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SAD TRAGEDY WHICH
FOLLOWED
THE CORONER THAT IS FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE
I NEED NOT POINT
OUT TO YOU THAT YOUR REFUSAL TO ANSWER WILL PREJUDICE YOUR CASE
CONSIDERABLY IN ANY FUTURE PROCEEDINGS WHICH MAY ARISE
WITNESS I MUST STILL REFUSE
THE CORONER I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CRY OF 'COOEE' WAS A COMMON
SIGNAL BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FATHER
WITNESS IT WAS
THE CORONER HOW WAS IT THEN THAT HE UTTERED IT BEFORE HE SAW
YOU AND BEFORE HE EVEN KNEW THAT YOU HAD RETURNED FROM BRISTOL
WITNESS WITH CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION I DO NOT KNOW
A JURYMAN DID YOU SEE NOTHING WHICH AROUSED YOUR SUSPICIONS
WHEN YOU RETURNED ON HEARING THE CRY AND FOUND YOUR FATHER
FATALLY INJURED
WITNESS NOTHING DEFINITE
THE CORONER WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WITNESS I WAS SO DISTURBED AND EXCITED AS I RUSHED OUT INTO
THE OPEN THAT I COULD THINK OF NOTHING EXCEPT OF MY FATHER
YET
I HAVE A VAGUE IMPRESSION THAT AS I RAN FORWARD SOMETHING LAY
UPON THE GROUND TO THE LEFT OF ME
IT SEEMED TO ME TO BE
SOMETHING GREY IN COLOUR A COAT OF SOME SORT OR A PLAID PERHAPS
WHEN I ROSE FROM MY FATHER I LOOKED ROUND FOR IT BUT IT WAS
GONE
'DO YOU MEAN THAT IT DISAPPEARED BEFORE YOU WENT FOR HELP
'YES IT WAS GONE
'YOU CANNOT SAY WHAT IT WAS
'NO I HAD A FEELING SOMETHING WAS THERE
'HOW FAR FROM THE BODY
'A DOZEN YARDS OR SO
'AND HOW FAR FROM THE EDGE OF THE WOOD
'ABOUT THE SAME
'THEN IF IT WAS REMOVED IT WAS WHILE YOU WERE WITHIN A DOZEN
YARDS OF IT
'YES BUT WITH MY BACK TOWARDS IT
THIS CONCLUDED THE EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS
I SEE SAID I AS I GLANCED DOWN THE COLUMN THAT THE CORONER
IN HIS CONCLUDING REMARKS WAS RATHER SEVERE UPON YOUNG MCCARTHY
HE CALLS ATTENTION AND WITH REASON TO THE DISCREPANCY ABOUT HIS
FATHER HAVING SIGNALLED TO HIM BEFORE SEEING HIM ALSO TO HIS
REFUSAL TO GIVE DETAILS OF HIS CONVERSATION WITH HIS FATHER AND
HIS SINGULAR ACCOUNT OF HIS FATHER'S DYING WORDS
THEY ARE ALL
AS HE REMARKS VERY MUCH AGAINST THE SON
HOLMES LAUGHED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AND STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT UPON
THE CUSHIONED SEAT
BOTH YOU AND THE CORONER HAVE BEEN AT SOME
PAINS SAID HE TO SINGLE OUT THE VERY STRONGEST POINTS IN THE
YOUNG MAN'S FAVOUR
DON'T YOU SEE THAT YOU ALTERNATELY GIVE HIM
CREDIT FOR HAVING TOO MUCH IMAGINATION AND TOO LITTLE TOO
LITTLE IF HE COULD NOT INVENT A CAUSE OF QUARREL WHICH WOULD
GIVE HIM THE SYMPATHY OF THE JURY TOO MUCH IF HE EVOLVED FROM
HIS OWN INNER CONSCIOUSNESS ANYTHING SO OUTR AS A DYING
REFERENCE TO A RAT AND THE INCIDENT OF THE VANISHING CLOTH
NO
SIR I SHALL APPROACH THIS CASE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THAT WHAT
THIS YOUNG MAN SAYS IS TRUE AND WE SHALL SEE WHITHER THAT
HYPOTHESIS WILL LEAD US
AND NOW HERE IS MY POCKET PETRARCH AND
NOT ANOTHER WORD SHALL I SAY OF THIS CASE UNTIL WE ARE ON THE
SCENE OF ACTION
WE LUNCH AT SWINDON AND I SEE THAT WE SHALL BE
THERE IN TWENTY MINUTES
IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK WHEN WE AT LAST AFTER PASSING THROUGH
THE BEAUTIFUL STROUD VALLEY AND OVER THE BROAD GLEAMING SEVERN
FOUND OURSELVES AT THE PRETTY LITTLE COUNTRY TOWN OF ROSS
A
LEAN FERRET LIKE MAN FURTIVE AND SLY LOOKING WAS WAITING FOR
US UPON THE PLATFORM
IN SPITE OF THE LIGHT BROWN DUSTCOAT AND
LEATHER LEGGINGS WHICH HE WORE IN DEFERENCE TO HIS RUSTIC
SURROUNDINGS I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNISING LESTRADE OF
SCOTLAND YARD
WITH HIM WE DROVE TO THE HEREFORD ARMS WHERE A
ROOM HAD ALREADY BEEN ENGAGED FOR US
I HAVE ORDERED A CARRIAGE SAID LESTRADE AS WE SAT OVER A CUP
OF TEA
I KNEW YOUR ENERGETIC NATURE AND THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE
HAPPY UNTIL YOU HAD BEEN ON THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
IT WAS VERY NICE AND COMPLIMENTARY OF YOU HOLMES ANSWERED
IT
IS ENTIRELY A QUESTION OF BAROMETRIC PRESSURE
LESTRADE LOOKED STARTLED
I DO NOT QUITE FOLLOW HE SAID
HOW IS THE GLASS TWENTY NINE I SEE
NO WIND AND NOT A CLOUD
IN THE SKY
I HAVE A CASEFUL OF CIGARETTES HERE WHICH NEED
SMOKING AND THE SOFA IS VERY MUCH SUPERIOR TO THE USUAL COUNTRY
HOTEL ABOMINATION
I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT I
SHALL USE THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT
LESTRADE LAUGHED INDULGENTLY
YOU HAVE NO DOUBT ALREADY FORMED
YOUR CONCLUSIONS FROM THE NEWSPAPERS HE SAID
THE CASE IS AS
PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF AND THE MORE ONE GOES INTO IT THE PLAINER
IT BECOMES
STILL OF COURSE ONE CAN'T REFUSE A LADY AND SUCH A
VERY POSITIVE ONE TOO
SHE HAS HEARD OF YOU AND WOULD HAVE YOUR
OPINION THOUGH I REPEATEDLY TOLD HER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING
WHICH YOU COULD DO WHICH I HAD NOT ALREADY DONE
WHY BLESS MY
SOUL HERE IS HER CARRIAGE AT THE DOOR
HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN BEFORE THERE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM ONE OF THE
MOST LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
HER
VIOLET EYES SHINING HER LIPS PARTED A PINK FLUSH UPON HER
CHEEKS ALL THOUGHT OF HER NATURAL RESERVE LOST IN HER
OVERPOWERING EXCITEMENT AND CONCERN
OH MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE CRIED GLANCING FROM ONE TO THE
OTHER OF US AND FINALLY WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INTUITION
FASTENING UPON MY COMPANION I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME
I
HAVE DRIVEN DOWN TO TELL YOU SO
I KNOW THAT JAMES DIDN'T DO IT
I KNOW IT AND I WANT YOU TO START UPON YOUR WORK KNOWING IT
TOO
NEVER LET YOURSELF DOUBT UPON THAT POINT
WE HAVE KNOWN EACH
OTHER SINCE WE WERE LITTLE CHILDREN AND I KNOW HIS FAULTS AS NO
ONE ELSE DOES BUT HE IS TOO TENDER HEARTED TO HURT A FLY
SUCH A
CHARGE IS ABSURD TO ANYONE WHO REALLY KNOWS HIM
I HOPE WE MAY CLEAR HIM MISS TURNER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
YOU MAY RELY UPON MY DOING ALL THAT I CAN
BUT YOU HAVE READ THE EVIDENCE
YOU HAVE FORMED SOME CONCLUSION
DO YOU NOT SEE SOME LOOPHOLE SOME FLAW DO YOU NOT YOURSELF
THINK THAT HE IS INNOCENT
I THINK THAT IT IS VERY PROBABLE
THERE NOW SHE CRIED THROWING BACK HER HEAD AND LOOKING
DEFIANTLY AT LESTRADE
YOU HEAR HE GIVES ME HOPES
LESTRADE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I AM AFRAID THAT MY COLLEAGUE
HAS BEEN A LITTLE QUICK IN FORMING HIS CONCLUSIONS HE SAID
BUT HE IS RIGHT
OH I KNOW THAT HE IS RIGHT
JAMES NEVER DID
IT
AND ABOUT HIS QUARREL WITH HIS FATHER I AM SURE THAT THE
REASON WHY HE WOULD NOT SPEAK ABOUT IT TO THE CORONER WAS BECAUSE
I WAS CONCERNED IN IT
IN WHAT WAY ASKED HOLMES
IT IS NO TIME FOR ME TO HIDE ANYTHING
JAMES AND HIS FATHER HAD
MANY DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT ME
MR
MCCARTHY WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT
THERE SHOULD BE A MARRIAGE BETWEEN US
JAMES AND I HAVE ALWAYS
LOVED EACH OTHER AS BROTHER AND SISTER BUT OF COURSE HE IS YOUNG
AND HAS SEEN VERY LITTLE OF LIFE YET AND AND WELL HE
NATURALLY DID NOT WISH TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT YET
SO THERE
WERE QUARRELS AND THIS I AM SURE WAS ONE OF THEM
AND YOUR FATHER ASKED HOLMES
WAS HE IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A
UNION
NO HE WAS AVERSE TO IT ALSO
NO ONE BUT MR
MCCARTHY WAS IN
FAVOUR OF IT A QUICK BLUSH PASSED OVER HER FRESH YOUNG FACE AS
HOLMES SHOT ONE OF HIS KEEN QUESTIONING GLANCES AT HER
THANK YOU FOR THIS INFORMATION SAID HE
MAY I SEE YOUR FATHER
IF I CALL TO MORROW
I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WON'T ALLOW IT
THE DOCTOR
YES HAVE YOU NOT HEARD POOR FATHER HAS NEVER BEEN STRONG FOR
YEARS BACK BUT THIS HAS BROKEN HIM DOWN COMPLETELY
HE HAS TAKEN
TO HIS BED AND DR
WILLOWS SAYS THAT HE IS A WRECK AND THAT HIS
NERVOUS SYSTEM IS SHATTERED
MR
MCCARTHY WAS THE ONLY MAN ALIVE
WHO HAD KNOWN DAD IN THE OLD DAYS IN VICTORIA
HA IN VICTORIA THAT IS IMPORTANT
YES AT THE MINES
QUITE SO AT THE GOLD MINES WHERE AS I UNDERSTAND MR
TURNER
MADE HIS MONEY
YES CERTAINLY
THANK YOU MISS TURNER
YOU HAVE BEEN OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO
ME
YOU WILL TELL ME IF YOU HAVE ANY NEWS TO MORROW
NO DOUBT YOU
WILL GO TO THE PRISON TO SEE JAMES
OH IF YOU DO MR
HOLMES DO
TELL HIM THAT I KNOW HIM TO BE INNOCENT
I WILL MISS TURNER
I MUST GO HOME NOW FOR DAD IS VERY ILL AND HE MISSES ME SO IF
I LEAVE HIM
GOOD BYE AND GOD HELP YOU IN YOUR UNDERTAKING SHE
HURRIED FROM THE ROOM AS IMPULSIVELY AS SHE HAD ENTERED AND WE
HEARD THE WHEELS OF HER CARRIAGE RATTLE OFF DOWN THE STREET
I AM ASHAMED OF YOU HOLMES SAID LESTRADE WITH DIGNITY AFTER A
FEW MINUTES' SILENCE
WHY SHOULD YOU RAISE UP HOPES WHICH YOU
ARE BOUND TO DISAPPOINT I AM NOT OVER TENDER OF HEART BUT I
CALL IT CRUEL
I THINK THAT I SEE MY WAY TO CLEARING JAMES MCCARTHY SAID
HOLMES
HAVE YOU AN ORDER TO SEE HIM IN PRISON
YES BUT ONLY FOR YOU AND ME
THEN I SHALL RECONSIDER MY RESOLUTION ABOUT GOING OUT
WE HAVE
STILL TIME TO TAKE A TRAIN TO HEREFORD AND SEE HIM TO NIGHT
AMPLE
THEN LET US DO SO
WATSON I FEAR THAT YOU WILL FIND IT VERY
SLOW BUT I SHALL ONLY BE AWAY A COUPLE OF HOURS
I WALKED DOWN TO THE STATION WITH THEM AND THEN WANDERED THROUGH
THE STREETS OF THE LITTLE TOWN FINALLY RETURNING TO THE HOTEL
WHERE I LAY UPON THE SOFA AND TRIED TO INTEREST MYSELF IN A
YELLOW BACKED NOVEL
THE PUNY PLOT OF THE STORY WAS SO THIN
HOWEVER WHEN COMPARED TO THE DEEP MYSTERY THROUGH WHICH WE WERE
GROPING AND I FOUND MY ATTENTION WANDER SO CONTINUALLY FROM THE
ACTION TO THE FACT THAT I AT LAST FLUNG IT ACROSS THE ROOM AND
GAVE MYSELF UP ENTIRELY TO A CONSIDERATION OF THE EVENTS OF THE
DAY
SUPPOSING THAT THIS UNHAPPY YOUNG MAN'S STORY WERE
ABSOLUTELY TRUE THEN WHAT HELLISH THING WHAT ABSOLUTELY
UNFORESEEN AND EXTRAORDINARY CALAMITY COULD HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN
THE TIME WHEN HE PARTED FROM HIS FATHER AND THE MOMENT WHEN
DRAWN BACK BY HIS SCREAMS HE RUSHED INTO THE GLADE IT WAS
SOMETHING TERRIBLE AND DEADLY
WHAT COULD IT BE MIGHT NOT THE
NATURE OF THE INJURIES REVEAL SOMETHING TO MY MEDICAL INSTINCTS
I RANG THE BELL AND CALLED FOR THE WEEKLY COUNTY PAPER WHICH
CONTAINED A VERBATIM ACCOUNT OF THE INQUEST
IN THE SURGEON'S
DEPOSITION IT WAS STATED THAT THE POSTERIOR THIRD OF THE LEFT
PARIETAL BONE AND THE LEFT HALF OF THE OCCIPITAL BONE HAD BEEN
SHATTERED BY A HEAVY BLOW FROM A BLUNT WEAPON
I MARKED THE SPOT
UPON MY OWN HEAD
CLEARLY SUCH A BLOW MUST HAVE BEEN STRUCK FROM
BEHIND
THAT WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN FAVOUR OF THE ACCUSED AS WHEN
SEEN QUARRELLING HE WAS FACE TO FACE WITH HIS FATHER
STILL IT
DID NOT GO FOR VERY MUCH FOR THE OLDER MAN MIGHT HAVE TURNED HIS
BACK BEFORE THE BLOW FELL
STILL IT MIGHT BE WORTH WHILE TO CALL
HOLMES' ATTENTION TO IT
THEN THERE WAS THE PECULIAR DYING
REFERENCE TO A RAT
WHAT COULD THAT MEAN IT COULD NOT BE
DELIRIUM
A MAN DYING FROM A SUDDEN BLOW DOES NOT COMMONLY BECOME
DELIRIOUS
NO IT WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN HOW
HE MET HIS FATE
BUT WHAT COULD IT INDICATE I CUDGELLED MY
BRAINS TO FIND SOME POSSIBLE EXPLANATION
AND THEN THE INCIDENT
OF THE GREY CLOTH SEEN BY YOUNG MCCARTHY
IF THAT WERE TRUE THE
MURDERER MUST HAVE DROPPED SOME PART OF HIS DRESS PRESUMABLY HIS
OVERCOAT IN HIS FLIGHT AND MUST HAVE HAD THE HARDIHOOD TO
RETURN AND TO CARRY IT AWAY AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SON WAS
KNEELING WITH HIS BACK TURNED NOT A DOZEN PACES OFF
WHAT A
TISSUE OF MYSTERIES AND IMPROBABILITIES THE WHOLE THING WAS I
DID NOT WONDER AT LESTRADE'S OPINION AND YET I HAD SO MUCH FAITH
IN SHERLOCK HOLMES' INSIGHT THAT I COULD NOT LOSE HOPE AS LONG
AS EVERY FRESH FACT SEEMED TO STRENGTHEN HIS CONVICTION OF YOUNG
MCCARTHY'S INNOCENCE
IT WAS LATE BEFORE SHERLOCK HOLMES RETURNED
HE CAME BACK ALONE
FOR LESTRADE WAS STAYING IN LODGINGS IN THE TOWN
THE GLASS STILL KEEPS VERY HIGH HE REMARKED AS HE SAT DOWN
IT IS OF IMPORTANCE THAT IT SHOULD NOT RAIN BEFORE WE ARE ABLE
TO GO OVER THE GROUND
ON THE OTHER HAND A MAN SHOULD BE AT HIS
VERY BEST AND KEENEST FOR SUCH NICE WORK AS THAT AND I DID NOT
WISH TO DO IT WHEN FAGGED BY A LONG JOURNEY
I HAVE SEEN YOUNG
MCCARTHY
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM HIM
NOTHING
COULD HE THROW NO LIGHT
NONE AT ALL
I WAS INCLINED TO THINK AT ONE TIME THAT HE KNEW
WHO HAD DONE IT AND WAS SCREENING HIM OR HER BUT I AM CONVINCED
NOW THAT HE IS AS PUZZLED AS EVERYONE ELSE
HE IS NOT A VERY
QUICK WITTED YOUTH THOUGH COMELY TO LOOK AT AND I SHOULD THINK
SOUND AT HEART
I CANNOT ADMIRE HIS TASTE I REMARKED IF IT IS INDEED A FACT
THAT HE WAS AVERSE TO A MARRIAGE WITH SO CHARMING A YOUNG LADY AS
THIS MISS TURNER
AH THEREBY HANGS A RATHER PAINFUL TALE
THIS FELLOW IS MADLY
INSANELY IN LOVE WITH HER BUT SOME TWO YEARS AGO WHEN HE WAS
ONLY A LAD AND BEFORE HE REALLY KNEW HER FOR SHE HAD BEEN AWAY
FIVE YEARS AT A BOARDING SCHOOL WHAT DOES THE IDIOT DO BUT GET
INTO THE CLUTCHES OF A BARMAID IN BRISTOL AND MARRY HER AT A
REGISTRY OFFICE NO ONE KNOWS A WORD OF THE MATTER BUT YOU CAN
IMAGINE HOW MADDENING IT MUST BE TO HIM TO BE UPBRAIDED FOR NOT
DOING WHAT HE WOULD GIVE HIS VERY EYES TO DO BUT WHAT HE KNOWS
TO BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE
IT WAS SHEER FRENZY OF THIS SORT
WHICH MADE HIM THROW HIS HANDS UP INTO THE AIR WHEN HIS FATHER
AT THEIR LAST INTERVIEW WAS GOADING HIM ON TO PROPOSE TO MISS
TURNER
ON THE OTHER HAND HE HAD NO MEANS OF SUPPORTING HIMSELF
AND HIS FATHER WHO WAS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A VERY HARD MAN WOULD
HAVE THROWN HIM OVER UTTERLY HAD HE KNOWN THE TRUTH
IT WAS WITH
HIS BARMAID WIFE THAT HE HAD SPENT THE LAST THREE DAYS IN
BRISTOL AND HIS FATHER DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS
MARK THAT
POINT
IT IS OF IMPORTANCE
GOOD HAS COME OUT OF EVIL HOWEVER
FOR THE BARMAID FINDING FROM THE PAPERS THAT HE IS IN SERIOUS
TROUBLE AND LIKELY TO BE HANGED HAS THROWN HIM OVER UTTERLY AND
HAS WRITTEN TO HIM TO SAY THAT SHE HAS A HUSBAND ALREADY IN THE
BERMUDA DOCKYARD SO THAT THERE IS REALLY NO TIE BETWEEN THEM
I
THINK THAT THAT BIT OF NEWS HAS CONSOLED YOUNG MCCARTHY FOR ALL
THAT HE HAS SUFFERED
BUT IF HE IS INNOCENT WHO HAS DONE IT
AH WHO I WOULD CALL YOUR ATTENTION VERY PARTICULARLY TO TWO
POINTS
ONE IS THAT THE MURDERED MAN HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH
SOMEONE AT THE POOL AND THAT THE SOMEONE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HIS
SON FOR HIS SON WAS AWAY AND HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN HE WOULD
RETURN
THE SECOND IS THAT THE MURDERED MAN WAS HEARD TO CRY
'COOEE BEFORE HE KNEW THAT HIS SON HAD RETURNED
THOSE ARE THE
CRUCIAL POINTS UPON WHICH THE CASE DEPENDS
AND NOW LET US TALK
ABOUT GEORGE MEREDITH IF YOU PLEASE AND WE SHALL LEAVE ALL
MINOR MATTERS UNTIL TO MORROW
THERE WAS NO RAIN AS HOLMES HAD FORETOLD AND THE MORNING BROKE
BRIGHT AND CLOUDLESS
AT NINE O'CLOCK LESTRADE CALLED FOR US WITH
THE CARRIAGE AND WE SET OFF FOR HATHERLEY FARM AND THE BOSCOMBE
POOL
THERE IS SERIOUS NEWS THIS MORNING LESTRADE OBSERVED
IT IS
SAID THAT MR
TURNER OF THE HALL IS SO ILL THAT HIS LIFE IS
DESPAIRED OF
AN ELDERLY MAN I PRESUME SAID HOLMES
ABOUT SIXTY BUT HIS CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN SHATTERED BY HIS LIFE
ABROAD AND HE HAS BEEN IN FAILING HEALTH FOR SOME TIME
THIS
BUSINESS HAS HAD A VERY BAD EFFECT UPON HIM
HE WAS AN OLD FRIEND
OF MCCARTHY'S AND I MAY ADD A GREAT BENEFACTOR TO HIM FOR I
HAVE LEARNED THAT HE GAVE HIM HATHERLEY FARM RENT FREE
INDEED THAT IS INTERESTING SAID HOLMES
OH YES IN A HUNDRED OTHER WAYS HE HAS HELPED HIM
EVERYBODY
ABOUT HERE SPEAKS OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIM
REALLY DOES IT NOT STRIKE YOU AS A LITTLE SINGULAR THAT THIS
MCCARTHY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE HAD LITTLE OF HIS OWN AND TO HAVE
BEEN UNDER SUCH OBLIGATIONS TO TURNER SHOULD STILL TALK OF
MARRYING HIS SON TO TURNER'S DAUGHTER WHO IS PRESUMABLY
HEIRESS TO THE ESTATE AND THAT IN SUCH A VERY COCKSURE MANNER
AS IF IT WERE MERELY A CASE OF A PROPOSAL AND ALL ELSE WOULD
FOLLOW IT IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE WE KNOW THAT TURNER HIMSELF
WAS AVERSE TO THE IDEA
THE DAUGHTER TOLD US AS MUCH
DO YOU NOT
DEDUCE SOMETHING FROM THAT
WE HAVE GOT TO THE DEDUCTIONS AND THE INFERENCES SAID
LESTRADE WINKING AT ME
I FIND IT HARD ENOUGH TO TACKLE FACTS
HOLMES WITHOUT FLYING AWAY AFTER THEORIES AND FANCIES
YOU ARE RIGHT SAID HOLMES DEMURELY YOU DO FIND IT VERY HARD
TO TACKLE THE FACTS
ANYHOW I HAVE GRASPED ONE FACT WHICH YOU SEEM TO FIND IT
DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF REPLIED LESTRADE WITH SOME WARMTH
AND THAT IS
THAT MCCARTHY SENIOR MET HIS DEATH FROM MCCARTHY JUNIOR AND THAT
ALL THEORIES TO THE CONTRARY ARE THE MEREST MOONSHINE
WELL MOONSHINE IS A BRIGHTER THING THAN FOG SAID HOLMES
LAUGHING
BUT I AM VERY MUCH MISTAKEN IF THIS IS NOT HATHERLEY
FARM UPON THE LEFT
YES THAT IS IT IT WAS A WIDESPREAD COMFORTABLE LOOKING
BUILDING TWO STORIED SLATE ROOFED WITH GREAT YELLOW BLOTCHES
OF LICHEN UPON THE GREY WALLS
THE DRAWN BLINDS AND THE SMOKELESS
CHIMNEYS HOWEVER GAVE IT A STRICKEN LOOK AS THOUGH THE WEIGHT
OF THIS HORROR STILL LAY HEAVY UPON IT
WE CALLED AT THE DOOR
WHEN THE MAID AT HOLMES' REQUEST SHOWED US THE BOOTS WHICH HER
MASTER WORE AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH AND ALSO A PAIR OF THE
SON'S THOUGH NOT THE PAIR WHICH HE HAD THEN HAD
HAVING MEASURED
THESE VERY CAREFULLY FROM SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT POINTS HOLMES
DESIRED TO BE LED TO THE COURT YARD FROM WHICH WE ALL FOLLOWED
THE WINDING TRACK WHICH LED TO BOSCOMBE POOL
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS TRANSFORMED WHEN HE WAS HOT UPON SUCH A SCENT
AS THIS
MEN WHO HAD ONLY KNOWN THE QUIET THINKER AND LOGICIAN OF
BAKER STREET WOULD HAVE FAILED TO RECOGNISE HIM
HIS FACE FLUSHED
AND DARKENED
HIS BROWS WERE DRAWN INTO TWO HARD BLACK LINES
WHILE HIS EYES SHONE OUT FROM BENEATH THEM WITH A STEELY GLITTER
HIS FACE WAS BENT DOWNWARD HIS SHOULDERS BOWED HIS LIPS
COMPRESSED AND THE VEINS STOOD OUT LIKE WHIPCORD IN HIS LONG
SINEWY NECK
HIS NOSTRILS SEEMED TO DILATE WITH A PURELY ANIMAL
LUST FOR THE CHASE AND HIS MIND WAS SO ABSOLUTELY CONCENTRATED
UPON THE MATTER BEFORE HIM THAT A QUESTION OR REMARK FELL
UNHEEDED UPON HIS EARS OR AT THE MOST ONLY PROVOKED A QUICK
IMPATIENT SNARL IN REPLY
SWIFTLY AND SILENTLY HE MADE HIS WAY
ALONG THE TRACK WHICH RAN THROUGH THE MEADOWS AND SO BY WAY OF
THE WOODS TO THE BOSCOMBE POOL
IT WAS DAMP MARSHY GROUND AS IS
ALL THAT DISTRICT AND THERE WERE MARKS OF MANY FEET BOTH UPON
THE PATH AND AMID THE SHORT GRASS WHICH BOUNDED IT ON EITHER
SIDE
SOMETIMES HOLMES WOULD HURRY ON SOMETIMES STOP DEAD AND
ONCE HE MADE QUITE A LITTLE DETOUR INTO THE MEADOW
LESTRADE AND
I WALKED BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE INDIFFERENT AND CONTEMPTUOUS
WHILE I WATCHED MY FRIEND WITH THE INTEREST WHICH SPRANG FROM THE
CONVICTION THAT EVERY ONE OF HIS ACTIONS WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS A
DEFINITE END
THE BOSCOMBE POOL WHICH IS A LITTLE REED GIRT SHEET OF WATER
SOME FIFTY YARDS ACROSS IS SITUATED AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE
HATHERLEY FARM AND THE PRIVATE PARK OF THE WEALTHY MR
TURNER
ABOVE THE WOODS WHICH LINED IT UPON THE FARTHER SIDE WE COULD SEE
THE RED JUTTING PINNACLES WHICH MARKED THE SITE OF THE RICH
LANDOWNER'S DWELLING
ON THE HATHERLEY SIDE OF THE POOL THE WOODS
GREW VERY THICK AND THERE WAS A NARROW BELT OF SODDEN GRASS
TWENTY PACES ACROSS BETWEEN THE EDGE OF THE TREES AND THE REEDS
WHICH LINED THE LAKE
LESTRADE SHOWED US THE EXACT SPOT AT WHICH
THE BODY HAD BEEN FOUND AND INDEED SO MOIST WAS THE GROUND
THAT I COULD PLAINLY SEE THE TRACES WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE
FALL OF THE STRICKEN MAN
TO HOLMES AS I COULD SEE BY HIS EAGER
FACE AND PEERING EYES VERY MANY OTHER THINGS WERE TO BE READ
UPON THE TRAMPLED GRASS
HE RAN ROUND LIKE A DOG WHO IS PICKING
UP A SCENT AND THEN TURNED UPON MY COMPANION
WHAT DID YOU GO INTO THE POOL FOR HE ASKED
I FISHED ABOUT WITH A RAKE
I THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE SOME WEAPON
OR OTHER TRACE
BUT HOW ON EARTH
OH TUT TUT I HAVE NO TIME THAT LEFT FOOT OF YOURS WITH ITS
INWARD TWIST IS ALL OVER THE PLACE
A MOLE COULD TRACE IT AND
THERE IT VANISHES AMONG THE REEDS
OH HOW SIMPLE IT WOULD ALL
HAVE BEEN HAD I BEEN HERE BEFORE THEY CAME LIKE A HERD OF BUFFALO
AND WALLOWED ALL OVER IT
HERE IS WHERE THE PARTY WITH THE
LODGE KEEPER CAME AND THEY HAVE COVERED ALL TRACKS FOR SIX OR
EIGHT FEET ROUND THE BODY
BUT HERE ARE THREE SEPARATE TRACKS OF
THE SAME FEET HE DREW OUT A LENS AND LAY DOWN UPON HIS
WATERPROOF TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW TALKING ALL THE TIME RATHER TO
HIMSELF THAN TO US
THESE ARE YOUNG MCCARTHY'S FEET
TWICE HE
WAS WALKING AND ONCE HE RAN SWIFTLY SO THAT THE SOLES ARE
DEEPLY MARKED AND THE HEELS HARDLY VISIBLE
THAT BEARS OUT HIS
STORY
HE RAN WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER ON THE GROUND
THEN HERE ARE
THE FATHER'S FEET AS HE PACED UP AND DOWN
WHAT IS THIS THEN IT
IS THE BUTT END OF THE GUN AS THE SON STOOD LISTENING
AND THIS
HA HA WHAT HAVE WE HERE TIPTOES TIPTOES SQUARE TOO QUITE
UNUSUAL BOOTS THEY COME THEY GO THEY COME AGAIN OF COURSE
THAT WAS FOR THE CLOAK
NOW WHERE DID THEY COME FROM HE RAN UP
AND DOWN SOMETIMES LOSING SOMETIMES FINDING THE TRACK UNTIL WE
WERE WELL WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE WOOD AND UNDER THE SHADOW OF A
GREAT BEECH THE LARGEST TREE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
HOLMES TRACED
HIS WAY TO THE FARTHER SIDE OF THIS AND LAY DOWN ONCE MORE UPON
HIS FACE WITH A LITTLE CRY OF SATISFACTION
FOR A LONG TIME HE
REMAINED THERE TURNING OVER THE LEAVES AND DRIED STICKS
GATHERING UP WHAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE DUST INTO AN ENVELOPE AND
EXAMINING WITH HIS LENS NOT ONLY THE GROUND BUT EVEN THE BARK OF
THE TREE AS FAR AS HE COULD REACH
A JAGGED STONE WAS LYING AMONG
THE MOSS AND THIS ALSO HE CAREFULLY EXAMINED AND RETAINED
THEN
HE FOLLOWED A PATHWAY THROUGH THE WOOD UNTIL HE CAME TO THE
HIGHROAD WHERE ALL TRACES WERE LOST
IT HAS BEEN A CASE OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST HE REMARKED
RETURNING TO HIS NATURAL MANNER
I FANCY THAT THIS GREY HOUSE ON
THE RIGHT MUST BE THE LODGE
I THINK THAT I WILL GO IN AND HAVE A
WORD WITH MORAN AND PERHAPS WRITE A LITTLE NOTE
HAVING DONE
THAT WE MAY DRIVE BACK TO OUR LUNCHEON
YOU MAY WALK TO THE CAB
AND I SHALL BE WITH YOU PRESENTLY
IT WAS ABOUT TEN MINUTES BEFORE WE REGAINED OUR CAB AND DROVE
BACK INTO ROSS HOLMES STILL CARRYING WITH HIM THE STONE WHICH HE
HAD PICKED UP IN THE WOOD
THIS MAY INTEREST YOU LESTRADE HE REMARKED HOLDING IT OUT
THE MURDER WAS DONE WITH IT
I SEE NO MARKS
THERE ARE NONE
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEN
THE GRASS WAS GROWING UNDER IT
IT HAD ONLY LAIN THERE A FEW
DAYS
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A PLACE WHENCE IT HAD BEEN TAKEN
IT
CORRESPONDS WITH THE INJURIES
THERE IS NO SIGN OF ANY OTHER
WEAPON
AND THE MURDERER
IS A TALL MAN LEFT HANDED LIMPS WITH THE RIGHT LEG WEARS
THICK SOLED SHOOTING BOOTS AND A GREY CLOAK SMOKES INDIAN
CIGARS USES A CIGAR HOLDER AND CARRIES A BLUNT PEN KNIFE IN HIS
POCKET
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER INDICATIONS BUT THESE MAY BE
ENOUGH TO AID US IN OUR SEARCH
LESTRADE LAUGHED
I AM AFRAID THAT I AM STILL A SCEPTIC HE
SAID
THEORIES ARE ALL VERY WELL BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A
HARD HEADED BRITISH JURY
NOUS VERRONS ANSWERED HOLMES CALMLY
YOU WORK YOUR OWN
METHOD AND I SHALL WORK MINE
I SHALL BE BUSY THIS AFTERNOON
AND SHALL PROBABLY RETURN TO LONDON BY THE EVENING TRAIN
AND LEAVE YOUR CASE UNFINISHED
NO FINISHED
BUT THE MYSTERY
IT IS SOLVED
WHO WAS THE CRIMINAL THEN
THE GENTLEMAN I DESCRIBE
BUT WHO IS HE
SURELY IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT
THIS IS NOT SUCH A
POPULOUS NEIGHBOURHOOD
LESTRADE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
I AM A PRACTICAL MAN HE SAID
AND I REALLY CANNOT UNDERTAKE TO GO ABOUT THE COUNTRY LOOKING
FOR A LEFT HANDED GENTLEMAN WITH A GAME LEG
I SHOULD BECOME THE
LAUGHING STOCK OF SCOTLAND YARD
ALL RIGHT SAID HOLMES QUIETLY
I HAVE GIVEN YOU THE CHANCE
HERE ARE YOUR LODGINGS
GOOD BYE
I SHALL DROP YOU A LINE BEFORE
I LEAVE
HAVING LEFT LESTRADE AT HIS ROOMS WE DROVE TO OUR HOTEL WHERE
WE FOUND LUNCH UPON THE TABLE
HOLMES WAS SILENT AND BURIED IN
THOUGHT WITH A PAINED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE AS ONE WHO FINDS
HIMSELF IN A PERPLEXING POSITION
LOOK HERE WATSON HE SAID WHEN THE CLOTH WAS CLEARED JUST SIT
DOWN IN THIS CHAIR AND LET ME PREACH TO YOU FOR A LITTLE
I DON'T
KNOW QUITE WHAT TO DO AND I SHOULD VALUE YOUR ADVICE
LIGHT A
CIGAR AND LET ME EXPOUND
PRAY DO SO
WELL NOW IN CONSIDERING THIS CASE THERE ARE TWO POINTS ABOUT
YOUNG MCCARTHY'S NARRATIVE WHICH STRUCK US BOTH INSTANTLY
ALTHOUGH THEY IMPRESSED ME IN HIS FAVOUR AND YOU AGAINST HIM
ONE
WAS THE FACT THAT HIS FATHER SHOULD ACCORDING TO HIS ACCOUNT
CRY 'COOEE BEFORE SEEING HIM
THE OTHER WAS HIS SINGULAR DYING
REFERENCE TO A RAT
HE MUMBLED SEVERAL WORDS YOU UNDERSTAND BUT
THAT WAS ALL THAT CAUGHT THE SON'S EAR
NOW FROM THIS DOUBLE
POINT OUR RESEARCH MUST COMMENCE AND WE WILL BEGIN IT BY
PRESUMING THAT WHAT THE LAD SAYS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE
WHAT OF THIS 'COOEE THEN
WELL OBVIOUSLY IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MEANT FOR THE SON
THE
SON AS FAR AS HE KNEW WAS IN BRISTOL
IT WAS MERE CHANCE THAT
HE WAS WITHIN EARSHOT
THE 'COOEE WAS MEANT TO ATTRACT THE
ATTENTION OF WHOEVER IT WAS THAT HE HAD THE APPOINTMENT WITH
BUT
'COOEE' IS A DISTINCTLY AUSTRALIAN CRY AND ONE WHICH IS USED
BETWEEN AUSTRALIANS
THERE IS A STRONG PRESUMPTION THAT THE
PERSON WHOM MCCARTHY EXPECTED TO MEET HIM AT BOSCOMBE POOL WAS
SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IN AUSTRALIA
WHAT OF THE RAT THEN
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK A FOLDED PAPER FROM HIS POCKET AND FLATTENED
IT OUT ON THE TABLE
THIS IS A MAP OF THE COLONY OF VICTORIA
HE SAID
I WIRED TO BRISTOL FOR IT LAST NIGHT HE PUT HIS HAND
OVER PART OF THE MAP
WHAT DO YOU READ
ARAT I READ
AND NOW HE RAISED HIS HAND
BALLARAT
QUITE SO
THAT WAS THE WORD THE MAN UTTERED AND OF WHICH HIS
SON ONLY CAUGHT THE LAST TWO SYLLABLES
HE WAS TRYING TO UTTER
THE NAME OF HIS MURDERER
SO AND SO OF BALLARAT
IT IS WONDERFUL I EXCLAIMED
IT IS OBVIOUS
AND NOW YOU SEE I HAD NARROWED THE FIELD DOWN
CONSIDERABLY
THE POSSESSION OF A GREY GARMENT WAS A THIRD POINT
WHICH GRANTING THE SON'S STATEMENT TO BE CORRECT WAS A
CERTAINTY
WE HAVE COME NOW OUT OF MERE VAGUENESS TO THE DEFINITE
CONCEPTION OF AN AUSTRALIAN FROM BALLARAT WITH A GREY CLOAK
CERTAINLY
AND ONE WHO WAS AT HOME IN THE DISTRICT FOR THE POOL CAN ONLY
BE APPROACHED BY THE FARM OR BY THE ESTATE WHERE STRANGERS COULD
HARDLY WANDER
QUITE SO
THEN COMES OUR EXPEDITION OF TO DAY
BY AN EXAMINATION OF THE
GROUND I GAINED THE TRIFLING DETAILS WHICH I GAVE TO THAT
IMBECILE LESTRADE AS TO THE PERSONALITY OF THE CRIMINAL
BUT HOW DID YOU GAIN THEM
YOU KNOW MY METHOD
IT IS FOUNDED UPON THE OBSERVATION OF
TRIFLES
HIS HEIGHT I KNOW THAT YOU MIGHT ROUGHLY JUDGE FROM THE LENGTH
OF HIS STRIDE
HIS BOOTS TOO MIGHT BE TOLD FROM THEIR TRACES
YES THEY WERE PECULIAR BOOTS
BUT HIS LAMENESS
THE IMPRESSION OF HIS RIGHT FOOT WAS ALWAYS LESS DISTINCT THAN
HIS LEFT
HE PUT LESS WEIGHT UPON IT
WHY BECAUSE HE LIMPED HE
WAS LAME
BUT HIS LEFT HANDEDNESS
YOU WERE YOURSELF STRUCK BY THE NATURE OF THE INJURY AS RECORDED
BY THE SURGEON AT THE INQUEST
THE BLOW WAS STRUCK FROM
IMMEDIATELY BEHIND AND YET WAS UPON THE LEFT SIDE
NOW HOW CAN
THAT BE UNLESS IT WERE BY A LEFT HANDED MAN HE HAD STOOD BEHIND
THAT TREE DURING THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE FATHER AND SON
HE HAD
EVEN SMOKED THERE
I FOUND THE ASH OF A CIGAR WHICH MY SPECIAL
KNOWLEDGE OF TOBACCO ASHES ENABLES ME TO PRONOUNCE AS AN INDIAN
CIGAR
I HAVE AS YOU KNOW DEVOTED SOME ATTENTION TO THIS AND
WRITTEN A LITTLE MONOGRAPH ON THE ASHES OF 140 DIFFERENT
VARIETIES OF PIPE CIGAR AND CIGARETTE TOBACCO
HAVING FOUND THE
ASH I THEN LOOKED ROUND AND DISCOVERED THE STUMP AMONG THE MOSS
WHERE HE HAD TOSSED IT
IT WAS AN INDIAN CIGAR OF THE VARIETY
WHICH ARE ROLLED IN ROTTERDAM
AND THE CIGAR HOLDER
I COULD SEE THAT THE END HAD NOT BEEN IN HIS MOUTH
THEREFORE HE
USED A HOLDER
THE TIP HAD BEEN CUT OFF NOT BITTEN OFF BUT THE
CUT WAS NOT A CLEAN ONE SO I DEDUCED A BLUNT PEN KNIFE
HOLMES I SAID YOU HAVE DRAWN A NET ROUND THIS MAN FROM WHICH
HE CANNOT ESCAPE AND YOU HAVE SAVED AN INNOCENT HUMAN LIFE AS
TRULY AS IF YOU HAD CUT THE CORD WHICH WAS HANGING HIM
I SEE THE
DIRECTION IN WHICH ALL THIS POINTS
THE CULPRIT IS
MR
JOHN TURNER CRIED THE HOTEL WAITER OPENING THE DOOR OF
OUR SITTING ROOM AND USHERING IN A VISITOR
THE MAN WHO ENTERED WAS A STRANGE AND IMPRESSIVE FIGURE
HIS
SLOW LIMPING STEP AND BOWED SHOULDERS GAVE THE APPEARANCE OF
DECREPITUDE AND YET HIS HARD DEEP LINED CRAGGY FEATURES AND
HIS ENORMOUS LIMBS SHOWED THAT HE WAS POSSESSED OF UNUSUAL
STRENGTH OF BODY AND OF CHARACTER
HIS TANGLED BEARD GRIZZLED
HAIR AND OUTSTANDING DROOPING EYEBROWS COMBINED TO GIVE AN AIR
OF DIGNITY AND POWER TO HIS APPEARANCE BUT HIS FACE WAS OF AN
ASHEN WHITE WHILE HIS LIPS AND THE CORNERS OF HIS NOSTRILS WERE
TINGED WITH A SHADE OF BLUE
IT WAS CLEAR TO ME AT A GLANCE THAT
HE WAS IN THE GRIP OF SOME DEADLY AND CHRONIC DISEASE
PRAY SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA SAID HOLMES GENTLY
YOU HAD MY
NOTE
YES THE LODGE KEEPER BROUGHT IT UP
YOU SAID THAT YOU WISHED TO
SEE ME HERE TO AVOID SCANDAL
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WOULD TALK IF I WENT TO THE HALL
AND WHY DID YOU WISH TO SEE ME HE LOOKED ACROSS AT MY
COMPANION WITH DESPAIR IN HIS WEARY EYES AS THOUGH HIS QUESTION
WAS ALREADY ANSWERED
YES SAID HOLMES ANSWERING THE LOOK RATHER THAN THE WORDS
IT
IS SO
I KNOW ALL ABOUT MCCARTHY
THE OLD MAN SANK HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS
GOD HELP ME HE CRIED
BUT I WOULD NOT HAVE LET THE YOUNG MAN COME TO HARM
I GIVE YOU
MY WORD THAT I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN OUT IF IT WENT AGAINST HIM AT
THE ASSIZES
I AM GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY SO SAID HOLMES GRAVELY
I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN NOW HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MY DEAR GIRL
IT
WOULD BREAK HER HEART IT WILL BREAK HER HEART WHEN SHE HEARS
THAT I AM ARRESTED
IT MAY NOT COME TO THAT SAID HOLMES
WHAT
I AM NO OFFICIAL AGENT
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER
WHO REQUIRED MY PRESENCE HERE AND I AM ACTING IN HER INTERESTS
YOUNG MCCARTHY MUST BE GOT OFF HOWEVER
I AM A DYING MAN SAID OLD TURNER
I HAVE HAD DIABETES FOR
YEARS
MY DOCTOR SAYS IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER I SHALL LIVE A
MONTH
YET I WOULD RATHER DIE UNDER MY OWN ROOF THAN IN A GAOL
HOLMES ROSE AND SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH HIS PEN IN HIS HAND
AND A BUNDLE OF PAPER BEFORE HIM
JUST TELL US THE TRUTH HE
SAID
I SHALL JOT DOWN THE FACTS
YOU WILL SIGN IT AND WATSON
HERE CAN WITNESS IT
THEN I COULD PRODUCE YOUR CONFESSION AT THE
LAST EXTREMITY TO SAVE YOUNG MCCARTHY
I PROMISE YOU THAT I SHALL
NOT USE IT UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED
IT'S AS WELL SAID THE OLD MAN IT'S A QUESTION WHETHER I
SHALL LIVE TO THE ASSIZES SO IT MATTERS LITTLE TO ME BUT I
SHOULD WISH TO SPARE ALICE THE SHOCK
AND NOW I WILL MAKE THE
THING CLEAR TO YOU IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME IN THE ACTING BUT
WILL NOT TAKE ME LONG TO TELL
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS DEAD MAN MCCARTHY
HE WAS A DEVIL
INCARNATE
I TELL YOU THAT
GOD KEEP YOU OUT OF THE CLUTCHES OF
SUCH A MAN AS HE
HIS GRIP HAS BEEN UPON ME THESE TWENTY YEARS
AND HE HAS BLASTED MY LIFE
I'LL TELL YOU FIRST HOW I CAME TO BE
IN HIS POWER
IT WAS IN THE EARLY '60'S AT THE DIGGINGS
I WAS A YOUNG CHAP
THEN HOT BLOODED AND RECKLESS READY TO TURN MY HAND AT
ANYTHING I GOT AMONG BAD COMPANIONS TOOK TO DRINK HAD NO LUCK
WITH MY CLAIM TOOK TO THE BUSH AND IN A WORD BECAME WHAT YOU
WOULD CALL OVER HERE A HIGHWAY ROBBER
THERE WERE SIX OF US AND
WE HAD A WILD FREE LIFE OF IT STICKING UP A STATION FROM TIME
TO TIME OR STOPPING THE WAGONS ON THE ROAD TO THE DIGGINGS
BLACK JACK OF BALLARAT WAS THE NAME I WENT UNDER AND OUR PARTY
IS STILL REMEMBERED IN THE COLONY AS THE BALLARAT GANG
ONE DAY A GOLD CONVOY CAME DOWN FROM BALLARAT TO MELBOURNE AND
WE LAY IN WAIT FOR IT AND ATTACKED IT
THERE WERE SIX TROOPERS
AND SIX OF US SO IT WAS A CLOSE THING BUT WE EMPTIED FOUR OF
THEIR SADDLES AT THE FIRST VOLLEY
THREE OF OUR BOYS WERE KILLED
HOWEVER BEFORE WE GOT THE SWAG
I PUT MY PISTOL TO THE HEAD OF
THE WAGON DRIVER WHO WAS THIS VERY MAN MCCARTHY
I WISH TO THE
LORD THAT I HAD SHOT HIM THEN BUT I SPARED HIM THOUGH I SAW HIS
WICKED LITTLE EYES FIXED ON MY FACE AS THOUGH TO REMEMBER EVERY
FEATURE
WE GOT AWAY WITH THE GOLD BECAME WEALTHY MEN AND MADE
OUR WAY OVER TO ENGLAND WITHOUT BEING SUSPECTED
THERE I PARTED
FROM MY OLD PALS AND DETERMINED TO SETTLE DOWN TO A QUIET AND
RESPECTABLE LIFE
I BOUGHT THIS ESTATE WHICH CHANCED TO BE IN
THE MARKET AND I SET MYSELF TO DO A LITTLE GOOD WITH MY MONEY
TO MAKE UP FOR THE WAY IN WHICH I HAD EARNED IT
I MARRIED TOO
AND THOUGH MY WIFE DIED YOUNG SHE LEFT ME MY DEAR LITTLE ALICE
EVEN WHEN SHE WAS JUST A BABY HER WEE HAND SEEMED TO LEAD ME DOWN
THE RIGHT PATH AS NOTHING ELSE HAD EVER DONE
IN A WORD I TURNED
OVER A NEW LEAF AND DID MY BEST TO MAKE UP FOR THE PAST
ALL WAS
GOING WELL WHEN MCCARTHY LAID HIS GRIP UPON ME
I HAD GONE UP TO TOWN ABOUT AN INVESTMENT AND I MET HIM IN
REGENT STREET WITH HARDLY A COAT TO HIS BACK OR A BOOT TO HIS
FOOT
'HERE WE ARE JACK SAYS HE TOUCHING ME ON THE ARM 'WE'LL BE
AS GOOD AS A FAMILY TO YOU
THERE'S TWO OF US ME AND MY SON AND
YOU CAN HAVE THE KEEPING OF US
IF YOU DON'T IT'S A FINE
LAW ABIDING COUNTRY IS ENGLAND AND THERE'S ALWAYS A POLICEMAN
WITHIN HAIL
WELL DOWN THEY CAME TO THE WEST COUNTRY THERE WAS NO SHAKING
THEM OFF AND THERE THEY HAVE LIVED RENT FREE ON MY BEST LAND
EVER SINCE
THERE WAS NO REST FOR ME NO PEACE NO FORGETFULNESS
TURN WHERE I WOULD THERE WAS HIS CUNNING GRINNING FACE AT MY
ELBOW
IT GREW WORSE AS ALICE GREW UP FOR HE SOON SAW I WAS MORE
AFRAID OF HER KNOWING MY PAST THAN OF THE POLICE
WHATEVER HE
WANTED HE MUST HAVE AND WHATEVER IT WAS I GAVE HIM WITHOUT
QUESTION LAND MONEY HOUSES UNTIL AT LAST HE ASKED A THING
WHICH I COULD NOT GIVE
HE ASKED FOR ALICE
HIS SON YOU SEE HAD GROWN UP AND SO HAD MY GIRL AND AS I WAS
KNOWN TO BE IN WEAK HEALTH IT SEEMED A FINE STROKE TO HIM THAT
HIS LAD SHOULD STEP INTO THE WHOLE PROPERTY
BUT THERE I WAS
FIRM
I WOULD NOT HAVE HIS CURSED STOCK MIXED WITH MINE NOT THAT
I HAD ANY DISLIKE TO THE LAD BUT HIS BLOOD WAS IN HIM AND THAT
WAS ENOUGH
I STOOD FIRM
MCCARTHY THREATENED
I BRAVED HIM TO DO
HIS WORST
WE WERE TO MEET AT THE POOL MIDWAY BETWEEN OUR HOUSES
TO TALK IT OVER
WHEN I WENT DOWN THERE I FOUND HIM TALKING WITH HIS SON SO I
SMOKED A CIGAR AND WAITED BEHIND A TREE UNTIL HE SHOULD BE ALONE
BUT AS I LISTENED TO HIS TALK ALL THAT WAS BLACK AND BITTER IN
ME SEEMED TO COME UPPERMOST
HE WAS URGING HIS SON TO MARRY MY
DAUGHTER WITH AS LITTLE REGARD FOR WHAT SHE MIGHT THINK AS IF SHE
WERE A SLUT FROM OFF THE STREETS
IT DROVE ME MAD TO THINK THAT I
AND ALL THAT I HELD MOST DEAR SHOULD BE IN THE POWER OF SUCH A
MAN AS THIS
COULD I NOT SNAP THE BOND I WAS ALREADY A DYING AND
A DESPERATE MAN
THOUGH CLEAR OF MIND AND FAIRLY STRONG OF LIMB
I KNEW THAT MY OWN FATE WAS SEALED
BUT MY MEMORY AND MY GIRL
BOTH COULD BE SAVED IF I COULD BUT SILENCE THAT FOUL TONGUE
I
DID IT MR
HOLMES
I WOULD DO IT AGAIN
DEEPLY AS I HAVE SINNED
I HAVE LED A LIFE OF MARTYRDOM TO ATONE FOR IT
BUT THAT MY GIRL
SHOULD BE ENTANGLED IN THE SAME MESHES WHICH HELD ME WAS MORE
THAN I COULD SUFFER
I STRUCK HIM DOWN WITH NO MORE COMPUNCTION
THAN IF HE HAD BEEN SOME FOUL AND VENOMOUS BEAST
HIS CRY BROUGHT
BACK HIS SON BUT I HAD GAINED THE COVER OF THE WOOD THOUGH I
WAS FORCED TO GO BACK TO FETCH THE CLOAK WHICH I HAD DROPPED IN
MY FLIGHT
THAT IS THE TRUE STORY GENTLEMEN OF ALL THAT
OCCURRED
WELL IT IS NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE YOU SAID HOLMES AS THE OLD MAN
SIGNED THE STATEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT
I PRAY THAT WE
MAY NEVER BE EXPOSED TO SUCH A TEMPTATION
I PRAY NOT SIR
AND WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO
IN VIEW OF YOUR HEALTH NOTHING
YOU ARE YOURSELF AWARE THAT YOU
WILL SOON HAVE TO ANSWER FOR YOUR DEED AT A HIGHER COURT THAN THE
ASSIZES
I WILL KEEP YOUR CONFESSION AND IF MCCARTHY IS
CONDEMNED I SHALL BE FORCED TO USE IT
IF NOT IT SHALL NEVER BE
SEEN BY MORTAL EYE AND YOUR SECRET WHETHER YOU BE ALIVE OR
DEAD SHALL BE SAFE WITH US
FAREWELL THEN SAID THE OLD MAN SOLEMNLY
YOUR OWN DEATHBEDS
WHEN THEY COME WILL BE THE EASIER FOR THE THOUGHT OF THE PEACE
WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN TO MINE TOTTERING AND SHAKING IN ALL HIS
GIANT FRAME HE STUMBLED SLOWLY FROM THE ROOM
GOD HELP US SAID HOLMES AFTER A LONG SILENCE
WHY DOES FATE
PLAY SUCH TRICKS WITH POOR HELPLESS WORMS I NEVER HEAR OF SUCH
A CASE AS THIS THAT I DO NOT THINK OF BAXTER'S WORDS AND SAY
'THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD GOES SHERLOCK HOLMES
JAMES MCCARTHY WAS ACQUITTED AT THE ASSIZES ON THE STRENGTH OF A
NUMBER OF OBJECTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN OUT BY HOLMES AND
SUBMITTED TO THE DEFENDING COUNSEL
OLD TURNER LIVED FOR SEVEN
MONTHS AFTER OUR INTERVIEW BUT HE IS NOW DEAD AND THERE IS
EVERY PROSPECT THAT THE SON AND DAUGHTER MAY COME TO LIVE HAPPILY
TOGETHER IN IGNORANCE OF THE BLACK CLOUD WHICH RESTS UPON THEIR
PAST
ADVENTURE V
THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
WHEN I GLANCE OVER MY NOTES AND RECORDS OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES
CASES BETWEEN THE YEARS '82 AND '90 I AM FACED BY SO MANY WHICH
PRESENT STRANGE AND INTERESTING FEATURES THAT IT IS NO EASY
MATTER TO KNOW WHICH TO CHOOSE AND WHICH TO LEAVE
SOME HOWEVER
HAVE ALREADY GAINED PUBLICITY THROUGH THE PAPERS AND OTHERS HAVE
NOT OFFERED A FIELD FOR THOSE PECULIAR QUALITIES WHICH MY FRIEND
POSSESSED IN SO HIGH A DEGREE AND WHICH IT IS THE OBJECT OF
THESE PAPERS TO ILLUSTRATE
SOME TOO HAVE BAFFLED HIS
ANALYTICAL SKILL AND WOULD BE AS NARRATIVES BEGINNINGS WITHOUT
AN ENDING WHILE OTHERS HAVE BEEN BUT PARTIALLY CLEARED UP AND
HAVE THEIR EXPLANATIONS FOUNDED RATHER UPON CONJECTURE AND
SURMISE THAN ON THAT ABSOLUTE LOGICAL PROOF WHICH WAS SO DEAR TO
HIM
THERE IS HOWEVER ONE OF THESE LAST WHICH WAS SO REMARKABLE
IN ITS DETAILS AND SO STARTLING IN ITS RESULTS THAT I AM TEMPTED
TO GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF IT IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE
POINTS IN CONNECTION WITH IT WHICH NEVER HAVE BEEN AND PROBABLY
NEVER WILL BE ENTIRELY CLEARED UP
THE YEAR '87 FURNISHED US WITH A LONG SERIES OF CASES OF GREATER
OR LESS INTEREST OF WHICH I RETAIN THE RECORDS
AMONG MY
HEADINGS UNDER THIS ONE TWELVE MONTHS I FIND AN ACCOUNT OF THE
ADVENTURE OF THE PARADOL CHAMBER OF THE AMATEUR MENDICANT
SOCIETY WHO HELD A LUXURIOUS CLUB IN THE LOWER VAULT OF A
FURNITURE WAREHOUSE OF THE FACTS CONNECTED WITH THE LOSS OF THE
BRITISH BARQUE SOPHY ANDERSON OF THE SINGULAR ADVENTURES OF THE
GRICE PATERSONS IN THE ISLAND OF UFFA AND FINALLY OF THE
CAMBERWELL POISONING CASE
IN THE LATTER AS MAY BE REMEMBERED
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ABLE BY WINDING UP THE DEAD MAN'S WATCH TO
PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN WOUND UP TWO HOURS BEFORE AND THAT
THEREFORE THE DECEASED HAD GONE TO BED WITHIN THAT TIME A
DEDUCTION WHICH WAS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN CLEARING UP THE
CASE
ALL THESE I MAY SKETCH OUT AT SOME FUTURE DATE BUT NONE OF
THEM PRESENT SUCH SINGULAR FEATURES AS THE STRANGE TRAIN OF
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH I HAVE NOW TAKEN UP MY PEN TO DESCRIBE
IT WAS IN THE LATTER DAYS OF SEPTEMBER AND THE EQUINOCTIAL GALES
HAD SET IN WITH EXCEPTIONAL VIOLENCE
ALL DAY THE WIND HAD
SCREAMED AND THE RAIN HAD BEATEN AGAINST THE WINDOWS SO THAT
EVEN HERE IN THE HEART OF GREAT HAND MADE LONDON WE WERE FORCED
TO RAISE OUR MINDS FOR THE INSTANT FROM THE ROUTINE OF LIFE AND
TO RECOGNISE THE PRESENCE OF THOSE GREAT ELEMENTAL FORCES WHICH
SHRIEK AT MANKIND THROUGH THE BARS OF HIS CIVILISATION LIKE
UNTAMED BEASTS IN A CAGE
AS EVENING DREW IN THE STORM GREW
HIGHER AND LOUDER AND THE WIND CRIED AND SOBBED LIKE A CHILD IN
THE CHIMNEY
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT MOODILY AT ONE SIDE OF THE
FIREPLACE CROSS INDEXING HIS RECORDS OF CRIME WHILE I AT THE
OTHER WAS DEEP IN ONE OF CLARK RUSSELL'S FINE SEA STORIES UNTIL
THE HOWL OF THE GALE FROM WITHOUT SEEMED TO BLEND WITH THE TEXT
AND THE SPLASH OF THE RAIN TO LENGTHEN OUT INTO THE LONG SWASH OF
THE SEA WAVES
MY WIFE WAS ON A VISIT TO HER MOTHER'S AND FOR A
FEW DAYS I WAS A DWELLER ONCE MORE IN MY OLD QUARTERS AT BAKER
STREET
WHY SAID I GLANCING UP AT MY COMPANION THAT WAS SURELY THE
BELL
WHO COULD COME TO NIGHT SOME FRIEND OF YOURS PERHAPS
EXCEPT YOURSELF I HAVE NONE HE ANSWERED
I DO NOT ENCOURAGE
VISITORS
A CLIENT THEN
IF SO IT IS A SERIOUS CASE
NOTHING LESS WOULD BRING A MAN OUT
ON SUCH A DAY AND AT SUCH AN HOUR
BUT I TAKE IT THAT IT IS MORE
LIKELY TO BE SOME CRONY OF THE LANDLADY'S
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS WRONG IN HIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER FOR THERE
CAME A STEP IN THE PASSAGE AND A TAPPING AT THE DOOR
HE
STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG ARM TO TURN THE LAMP AWAY FROM HIMSELF AND
TOWARDS THE VACANT CHAIR UPON WHICH A NEWCOMER MUST SIT
COME IN SAID HE
THE MAN WHO ENTERED WAS YOUNG SOME TWO AND TWENTY AT THE
OUTSIDE WELL GROOMED AND TRIMLY CLAD WITH SOMETHING OF
REFINEMENT AND DELICACY IN HIS BEARING
THE STREAMING UMBRELLA
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS HAND AND HIS LONG SHINING WATERPROOF TOLD
OF THE FIERCE WEATHER THROUGH WHICH HE HAD COME
HE LOOKED ABOUT
HIM ANXIOUSLY IN THE GLARE OF THE LAMP AND I COULD SEE THAT HIS
FACE WAS PALE AND HIS EYES HEAVY LIKE THOSE OF A MAN WHO IS
WEIGHED DOWN WITH SOME GREAT ANXIETY
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY HE SAID RAISING HIS GOLDEN PINCE NEZ TO
HIS EYES
I TRUST THAT I AM NOT INTRUDING
I FEAR THAT I HAVE
BROUGHT SOME TRACES OF THE STORM AND RAIN INTO YOUR SNUG
CHAMBER
GIVE ME YOUR COAT AND UMBRELLA SAID HOLMES
THEY MAY REST
HERE ON THE HOOK AND WILL BE DRY PRESENTLY
YOU HAVE COME UP FROM
THE SOUTH WEST I SEE
YES FROM HORSHAM
THAT CLAY AND CHALK MIXTURE WHICH I SEE UPON YOUR TOE CAPS IS
QUITE DISTINCTIVE
I HAVE COME FOR ADVICE
THAT IS EASILY GOT
AND HELP
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS SO EASY
I HAVE HEARD OF YOU MR
HOLMES
I HEARD FROM MAJOR PRENDERGAST
HOW YOU SAVED HIM IN THE TANKERVILLE CLUB SCANDAL
AH OF COURSE
HE WAS WRONGFULLY ACCUSED OF CHEATING AT CARDS
HE SAID THAT YOU COULD SOLVE ANYTHING
HE SAID TOO MUCH
THAT YOU ARE NEVER BEATEN
I HAVE BEEN BEATEN FOUR TIMES THREE TIMES BY MEN AND ONCE BY A
WOMAN
BUT WHAT IS THAT COMPARED WITH THE NUMBER OF YOUR SUCCESSES
IT IS TRUE THAT I HAVE BEEN GENERALLY SUCCESSFUL
THEN YOU MAY BE SO WITH ME
I BEG THAT YOU WILL DRAW YOUR CHAIR UP TO THE FIRE AND FAVOUR ME
WITH SOME DETAILS AS TO YOUR CASE
IT IS NO ORDINARY ONE
NONE OF THOSE WHICH COME TO ME ARE
I AM THE LAST COURT OF
APPEAL
AND YET I QUESTION SIR WHETHER IN ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE YOU
HAVE EVER LISTENED TO A MORE MYSTERIOUS AND INEXPLICABLE CHAIN OF
EVENTS THAN THOSE WHICH HAVE HAPPENED IN MY OWN FAMILY
YOU FILL ME WITH INTEREST SAID HOLMES
PRAY GIVE US THE
ESSENTIAL FACTS FROM THE COMMENCEMENT AND I CAN AFTERWARDS
QUESTION YOU AS TO THOSE DETAILS WHICH SEEM TO ME TO BE MOST
IMPORTANT
THE YOUNG MAN PULLED HIS CHAIR UP AND PUSHED HIS WET FEET OUT
TOWARDS THE BLAZE
MY NAME SAID HE IS JOHN OPENSHAW BUT MY OWN AFFAIRS HAVE
AS FAR AS I CAN UNDERSTAND LITTLE TO DO WITH THIS AWFUL
BUSINESS
IT IS A HEREDITARY MATTER SO IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE FACTS I MUST GO BACK TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE
AFFAIR
YOU MUST KNOW THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD TWO SONS MY UNCLE ELIAS
AND MY FATHER JOSEPH
MY FATHER HAD A SMALL FACTORY AT COVENTRY
WHICH HE ENLARGED AT THE TIME OF THE INVENTION OF BICYCLING
HE
WAS A PATENTEE OF THE OPENSHAW UNBREAKABLE TIRE AND HIS BUSINESS
MET WITH SUCH SUCCESS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO SELL IT AND TO RETIRE
UPON A HANDSOME COMPETENCE
MY UNCLE ELIAS EMIGRATED TO AMERICA WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN AND
BECAME A PLANTER IN FLORIDA WHERE HE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE DONE
VERY WELL
AT THE TIME OF THE WAR HE FOUGHT IN JACKSON'S ARMY
AND AFTERWARDS UNDER HOOD WHERE HE ROSE TO BE A COLONEL
WHEN
LEE LAID DOWN HIS ARMS MY UNCLE RETURNED TO HIS PLANTATION WHERE
HE REMAINED FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS
ABOUT 1869 OR 1870 HE CAME
BACK TO EUROPE AND TOOK A SMALL ESTATE IN SUSSEX NEAR HORSHAM
HE HAD MADE A VERY CONSIDERABLE FORTUNE IN THE STATES AND HIS
REASON FOR LEAVING THEM WAS HIS AVERSION TO THE NEGROES AND HIS
DISLIKE OF THE REPUBLICAN POLICY IN EXTENDING THE FRANCHISE TO
THEM
HE WAS A SINGULAR MAN FIERCE AND QUICK TEMPERED VERY
FOUL MOUTHED WHEN HE WAS ANGRY AND OF A MOST RETIRING
DISPOSITION
DURING ALL THE YEARS THAT HE LIVED AT HORSHAM I
DOUBT IF EVER HE SET FOOT IN THE TOWN
HE HAD A GARDEN AND TWO OR
THREE FIELDS ROUND HIS HOUSE AND THERE HE WOULD TAKE HIS
EXERCISE THOUGH VERY OFTEN FOR WEEKS ON END HE WOULD NEVER LEAVE
HIS ROOM
HE DRANK A GREAT DEAL OF BRANDY AND SMOKED VERY
HEAVILY BUT HE WOULD SEE NO SOCIETY AND DID NOT WANT ANY
FRIENDS NOT EVEN HIS OWN BROTHER
HE DIDN'T MIND ME IN FACT HE TOOK A FANCY TO ME FOR AT THE
TIME WHEN HE SAW ME FIRST I WAS A YOUNGSTER OF TWELVE OR SO
THIS
WOULD BE IN THE YEAR 1878 AFTER HE HAD BEEN EIGHT OR NINE YEARS
IN ENGLAND
HE BEGGED MY FATHER TO LET ME LIVE WITH HIM AND HE
WAS VERY KIND TO ME IN HIS WAY
WHEN HE WAS SOBER HE USED TO BE
FOND OF PLAYING BACKGAMMON AND DRAUGHTS WITH ME AND HE WOULD
MAKE ME HIS REPRESENTATIVE BOTH WITH THE SERVANTS AND WITH THE
TRADESPEOPLE SO THAT BY THE TIME THAT I WAS SIXTEEN I WAS QUITE
MASTER OF THE HOUSE
I KEPT ALL THE KEYS AND COULD GO WHERE I
LIKED AND DO WHAT I LIKED SO LONG AS I DID NOT DISTURB HIM IN
HIS PRIVACY
THERE WAS ONE SINGULAR EXCEPTION HOWEVER FOR HE
HAD A SINGLE ROOM A LUMBER ROOM UP AMONG THE ATTICS WHICH WAS
INVARIABLY LOCKED AND WHICH HE WOULD NEVER PERMIT EITHER ME OR
ANYONE ELSE TO ENTER
WITH A BOY'S CURIOSITY I HAVE PEEPED
THROUGH THE KEYHOLE BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO SEE MORE THAN SUCH A
COLLECTION OF OLD TRUNKS AND BUNDLES AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN SUCH
A ROOM
ONE DAY IT WAS IN MARCH 1883 A LETTER WITH A FOREIGN STAMP
LAY UPON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF THE COLONEL'S PLATE
IT WAS NOT A
COMMON THING FOR HIM TO RECEIVE LETTERS FOR HIS BILLS WERE ALL
PAID IN READY MONEY AND HE HAD NO FRIENDS OF ANY SORT
'FROM
INDIA SAID HE AS HE TOOK IT UP 'PONDICHERRY POSTMARK WHAT CAN
THIS BE OPENING IT HURRIEDLY OUT THERE JUMPED FIVE LITTLE
DRIED ORANGE PIPS WHICH PATTERED DOWN UPON HIS PLATE
I BEGAN TO
LAUGH AT THIS BUT THE LAUGH WAS STRUCK FROM MY LIPS AT THE SIGHT
OF HIS FACE
HIS LIP HAD FALLEN HIS EYES WERE PROTRUDING HIS
SKIN THE COLOUR OF PUTTY AND HE GLARED AT THE ENVELOPE WHICH HE
STILL HELD IN HIS TREMBLING HAND 'K
K
K HE SHRIEKED AND
THEN 'MY GOD MY GOD MY SINS HAVE OVERTAKEN ME
'WHAT IS IT UNCLE I CRIED
'DEATH SAID HE AND RISING FROM THE TABLE HE RETIRED TO HIS
ROOM LEAVING ME PALPITATING WITH HORROR
I TOOK UP THE ENVELOPE
AND SAW SCRAWLED IN RED INK UPON THE INNER FLAP JUST ABOVE THE
GUM THE LETTER K THREE TIMES REPEATED
THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE
SAVE THE FIVE DRIED PIPS
WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF HIS
OVERPOWERING TERROR I LEFT THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND AS I
ASCENDED THE STAIR I MET HIM COMING DOWN WITH AN OLD RUSTY KEY
WHICH MUST HAVE BELONGED TO THE ATTIC IN ONE HAND AND A SMALL
BRASS BOX LIKE A CASHBOX IN THE OTHER
'THEY MAY DO WHAT THEY LIKE BUT I'LL CHECKMATE THEM STILL
SAID HE WITH AN OATH
'TELL MARY THAT I SHALL WANT A FIRE IN MY
ROOM TO DAY AND SEND DOWN TO FORDHAM THE HORSHAM LAWYER
I DID AS HE ORDERED AND WHEN THE LAWYER ARRIVED I WAS ASKED TO
STEP UP TO THE ROOM
THE FIRE WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY AND IN THE
GRATE THERE WAS A MASS OF BLACK FLUFFY ASHES AS OF BURNED
PAPER WHILE THE BRASS BOX STOOD OPEN AND EMPTY BESIDE IT
AS I
GLANCED AT THE BOX I NOTICED WITH A START THAT UPON THE LID WAS
PRINTED THE TREBLE K WHICH I HAD READ IN THE MORNING UPON THE
ENVELOPE
'I WISH YOU JOHN SAID MY UNCLE 'TO WITNESS MY WILL
I LEAVE
MY ESTATE WITH ALL ITS ADVANTAGES AND ALL ITS DISADVANTAGES TO
MY BROTHER YOUR FATHER WHENCE IT WILL NO DOUBT DESCEND TO
YOU
IF YOU CAN ENJOY IT IN PEACE WELL AND GOOD IF YOU FIND YOU
CANNOT TAKE MY ADVICE MY BOY AND LEAVE IT TO YOUR DEADLIEST
ENEMY
I AM SORRY TO GIVE YOU SUCH A TWO EDGED THING BUT I CAN'T
SAY WHAT TURN THINGS ARE GOING TO TAKE
KINDLY SIGN THE PAPER
WHERE MR
FORDHAM SHOWS YOU
I SIGNED THE PAPER AS DIRECTED AND THE LAWYER TOOK IT AWAY WITH
HIM
THE SINGULAR INCIDENT MADE AS YOU MAY THINK THE DEEPEST
IMPRESSION UPON ME AND I PONDERED OVER IT AND TURNED IT EVERY
WAY IN MY MIND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE ANYTHING OF IT
YET I
COULD NOT SHAKE OFF THE VAGUE FEELING OF DREAD WHICH IT LEFT
BEHIND THOUGH THE SENSATION GREW LESS KEEN AS THE WEEKS PASSED
AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO DISTURB THE USUAL ROUTINE OF OUR LIVES
I
COULD SEE A CHANGE IN MY UNCLE HOWEVER
HE DRANK MORE THAN EVER
AND HE WAS LESS INCLINED FOR ANY SORT OF SOCIETY
MOST OF HIS
TIME HE WOULD SPEND IN HIS ROOM WITH THE DOOR LOCKED UPON THE
INSIDE BUT SOMETIMES HE WOULD EMERGE IN A SORT OF DRUNKEN FRENZY
AND WOULD BURST OUT OF THE HOUSE AND TEAR ABOUT THE GARDEN WITH A
REVOLVER IN HIS HAND SCREAMING OUT THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF NO MAN
AND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE COOPED UP LIKE A SHEEP IN A PEN BY
MAN OR DEVIL
WHEN THESE HOT FITS WERE OVER HOWEVER HE WOULD
RUSH TUMULTUOUSLY IN AT THE DOOR AND LOCK AND BAR IT BEHIND HIM
LIKE A MAN WHO CAN BRAZEN IT OUT NO LONGER AGAINST THE TERROR
WHICH LIES AT THE ROOTS OF HIS SOUL
AT SUCH TIMES I HAVE SEEN
HIS FACE EVEN ON A COLD DAY GLISTEN WITH MOISTURE AS THOUGH IT
WERE NEW RAISED FROM A BASIN
WELL TO COME TO AN END OF THE MATTER MR
HOLMES AND NOT TO
ABUSE YOUR PATIENCE THERE CAME A NIGHT WHEN HE MADE ONE OF THOSE
DRUNKEN SALLIES FROM WHICH HE NEVER CAME BACK
WE FOUND HIM WHEN
WE WENT TO SEARCH FOR HIM FACE DOWNWARD IN A LITTLE
GREEN SCUMMED POOL WHICH LAY AT THE FOOT OF THE GARDEN
THERE
WAS NO SIGN OF ANY VIOLENCE AND THE WATER WAS BUT TWO FEET DEEP
SO THAT THE JURY HAVING REGARD TO HIS KNOWN ECCENTRICITY
BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF 'SUICIDE BUT I WHO KNEW HOW HE WINCED
FROM THE VERY THOUGHT OF DEATH HAD MUCH ADO TO PERSUADE MYSELF
THAT HE HAD GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO MEET IT
THE MATTER PASSED
HOWEVER AND MY FATHER ENTERED INTO POSSESSION OF THE ESTATE AND
OF SOME 14 000 POUNDS WHICH LAY TO HIS CREDIT AT THE BANK
ONE MOMENT HOLMES INTERPOSED YOUR STATEMENT IS I FORESEE
ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE TO WHICH I HAVE EVER LISTENED
LET ME
HAVE THE DATE OF THE RECEPTION BY YOUR UNCLE OF THE LETTER AND
THE DATE OF HIS SUPPOSED SUICIDE
THE LETTER ARRIVED ON MARCH 10 1883
HIS DEATH WAS SEVEN WEEKS
LATER UPON THE NIGHT OF MAY 2ND
THANK YOU
PRAY PROCEED
WHEN MY FATHER TOOK OVER THE HORSHAM PROPERTY HE AT MY
REQUEST MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ATTIC WHICH HAD BEEN
ALWAYS LOCKED UP
WE FOUND THE BRASS BOX THERE ALTHOUGH ITS
CONTENTS HAD BEEN DESTROYED
ON THE INSIDE OF THE COVER WAS A
PAPER LABEL WITH THE INITIALS OF K
K
K
REPEATED UPON IT AND
'LETTERS MEMORANDA RECEIPTS AND A REGISTER' WRITTEN BENEATH
THESE WE PRESUME INDICATED THE NATURE OF THE PAPERS WHICH HAD
BEEN DESTROYED BY COLONEL OPENSHAW
FOR THE REST THERE WAS
NOTHING OF MUCH IMPORTANCE IN THE ATTIC SAVE A GREAT MANY
SCATTERED PAPERS AND NOTE BOOKS BEARING UPON MY UNCLE'S LIFE IN
AMERICA
SOME OF THEM WERE OF THE WAR TIME AND SHOWED THAT HE HAD
DONE HIS DUTY WELL AND HAD BORNE THE REPUTE OF A BRAVE SOLDIER
OTHERS WERE OF A DATE DURING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SOUTHERN
STATES AND WERE MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH POLITICS FOR HE HAD
EVIDENTLY TAKEN A STRONG PART IN OPPOSING THE CARPET BAG
POLITICIANS WHO HAD BEEN SENT DOWN FROM THE NORTH
WELL IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF '84 WHEN MY FATHER CAME TO LIVE AT
HORSHAM AND ALL WENT AS WELL AS POSSIBLE WITH US UNTIL THE
JANUARY OF '85
ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER THE NEW YEAR I HEARD MY
FATHER GIVE A SHARP CRY OF SURPRISE AS WE SAT TOGETHER AT THE
BREAKFAST TABLE
THERE HE WAS SITTING WITH A NEWLY OPENED
ENVELOPE IN ONE HAND AND FIVE DRIED ORANGE PIPS IN THE
OUTSTRETCHED PALM OF THE OTHER ONE
HE HAD ALWAYS LAUGHED AT WHAT
HE CALLED MY COCK AND BULL STORY ABOUT THE COLONEL BUT HE LOOKED
VERY SCARED AND PUZZLED NOW THAT THE SAME THING HAD COME UPON
HIMSELF
'WHY WHAT ON EARTH DOES THIS MEAN JOHN HE STAMMERED
MY HEART HAD TURNED TO LEAD
'IT IS K
K
K SAID I
HE LOOKED INSIDE THE ENVELOPE
'SO IT IS HE CRIED
'HERE ARE
THE VERY LETTERS
BUT WHAT IS THIS WRITTEN ABOVE THEM
'PUT THE PAPERS ON THE SUNDIAL I READ PEEPING OVER HIS
SHOULDER
'WHAT PAPERS WHAT SUNDIAL HE ASKED
'THE SUNDIAL IN THE GARDEN
THERE IS NO OTHER SAID I 'BUT THE
PAPERS MUST BE THOSE THAT ARE DESTROYED
'POOH SAID HE GRIPPING HARD AT HIS COURAGE
'WE ARE IN A
CIVILISED LAND HERE AND WE CAN'T HAVE TOMFOOLERY OF THIS KIND
WHERE DOES THE THING COME FROM
'FROM DUNDEE I ANSWERED GLANCING AT THE POSTMARK
'SOME PREPOSTEROUS PRACTICAL JOKE SAID HE
'WHAT HAVE I TO DO
WITH SUNDIALS AND PAPERS I SHALL TAKE NO NOTICE OF SUCH
NONSENSE
'I SHOULD CERTAINLY SPEAK TO THE POLICE I SAID
'AND BE LAUGHED AT FOR MY PAINS
NOTHING OF THE SORT
'THEN LET ME DO SO
'NO I FORBID YOU
I WON'T HAVE A FUSS MADE ABOUT SUCH
NONSENSE
IT WAS IN VAIN TO ARGUE WITH HIM FOR HE WAS A VERY OBSTINATE
MAN
I WENT ABOUT HOWEVER WITH A HEART WHICH WAS FULL OF
FOREBODINGS
ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE COMING OF THE LETTER MY FATHER WENT
FROM HOME TO VISIT AN OLD FRIEND OF HIS MAJOR FREEBODY WHO IS
IN COMMAND OF ONE OF THE FORTS UPON PORTSDOWN HILL
I WAS GLAD
THAT HE SHOULD GO FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE WAS FARTHER FROM
DANGER WHEN HE WAS AWAY FROM HOME
IN THAT HOWEVER I WAS IN
ERROR
UPON THE SECOND DAY OF HIS ABSENCE I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM
FROM THE MAJOR IMPLORING ME TO COME AT ONCE
MY FATHER HAD
FALLEN OVER ONE OF THE DEEP CHALK PITS WHICH ABOUND IN THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD AND WAS LYING SENSELESS WITH A SHATTERED SKULL
I
HURRIED TO HIM BUT HE PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HAVING EVER RECOVERED
HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
HE HAD AS IT APPEARS BEEN RETURNING FROM
FAREHAM IN THE TWILIGHT AND AS THE COUNTRY WAS UNKNOWN TO HIM
AND THE CHALK PIT UNFENCED THE JURY HAD NO HESITATION IN
BRINGING IN A VERDICT OF 'DEATH FROM ACCIDENTAL CAUSES
CAREFULLY AS I EXAMINED EVERY FACT CONNECTED WITH HIS DEATH I
WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WHICH COULD SUGGEST THE IDEA OF
MURDER
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE NO FOOTMARKS NO
ROBBERY NO RECORD OF STRANGERS HAVING BEEN SEEN UPON THE ROADS
AND YET I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT MY MIND WAS FAR FROM AT EASE
AND THAT I WAS WELL NIGH CERTAIN THAT SOME FOUL PLOT HAD BEEN
WOVEN ROUND HIM
IN THIS SINISTER WAY I CAME INTO MY INHERITANCE
YOU WILL ASK ME
WHY I DID NOT DISPOSE OF IT I ANSWER BECAUSE I WAS WELL
CONVINCED THAT OUR TROUBLES WERE IN SOME WAY DEPENDENT UPON AN
INCIDENT IN MY UNCLE'S LIFE AND THAT THE DANGER WOULD BE AS
PRESSING IN ONE HOUSE AS IN ANOTHER
IT WAS IN JANUARY '85 THAT MY POOR FATHER MET HIS END AND TWO
YEARS AND EIGHT MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THEN
DURING THAT TIME
I HAVE LIVED HAPPILY AT HORSHAM AND I HAD BEGUN TO HOPE THAT
THIS CURSE HAD PASSED AWAY FROM THE FAMILY AND THAT IT HAD ENDED
WITH THE LAST GENERATION
I HAD BEGUN TO TAKE COMFORT TOO SOON
HOWEVER YESTERDAY MORNING THE BLOW FELL IN THE VERY SHAPE IN
WHICH IT HAD COME UPON MY FATHER
THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOAT A CRUMPLED ENVELOPE AND
TURNING TO THE TABLE HE SHOOK OUT UPON IT FIVE LITTLE DRIED
ORANGE PIPS
THIS IS THE ENVELOPE HE CONTINUED
THE POSTMARK IS
LONDON EASTERN DIVISION
WITHIN ARE THE VERY WORDS WHICH WERE
UPON MY FATHER'S LAST MESSAGE 'K
K
K AND THEN 'PUT THE
PAPERS ON THE SUNDIAL
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ASKED HOLMES
NOTHING
NOTHING
TO TELL THE TRUTH HE SANK HIS FACE INTO HIS THIN WHITE
HANDS I HAVE FELT HELPLESS
I HAVE FELT LIKE ONE OF THOSE POOR
RABBITS WHEN THE SNAKE IS WRITHING TOWARDS IT
I SEEM TO BE IN
THE GRASP OF SOME RESISTLESS INEXORABLE EVIL WHICH NO FORESIGHT
AND NO PRECAUTIONS CAN GUARD AGAINST
TUT TUT CRIED SHERLOCK HOLMES
YOU MUST ACT MAN OR YOU ARE
LOST
NOTHING BUT ENERGY CAN SAVE YOU
THIS IS NO TIME FOR
DESPAIR
I HAVE SEEN THE POLICE
AH
BUT THEY LISTENED TO MY STORY WITH A SMILE
I AM CONVINCED THAT
THE INSPECTOR HAS FORMED THE OPINION THAT THE LETTERS ARE ALL
PRACTICAL JOKES AND THAT THE DEATHS OF MY RELATIONS WERE REALLY
ACCIDENTS AS THE JURY STATED AND WERE NOT TO BE CONNECTED WITH
THE WARNINGS
HOLMES SHOOK HIS CLENCHED HANDS IN THE AIR
INCREDIBLE
IMBECILITY HE CRIED
THEY HAVE HOWEVER ALLOWED ME A POLICEMAN WHO MAY REMAIN IN
THE HOUSE WITH ME
HAS HE COME WITH YOU TO NIGHT
NO
HIS ORDERS WERE TO STAY IN THE HOUSE
AGAIN HOLMES RAVED IN THE AIR
WHY DID YOU COME TO ME HE CRIED AND ABOVE ALL WHY DID YOU
NOT COME AT ONCE
I DID NOT KNOW
IT WAS ONLY TO DAY THAT I SPOKE TO MAJOR
PRENDERGAST ABOUT MY TROUBLES AND WAS ADVISED BY HIM TO COME TO
YOU
IT IS REALLY TWO DAYS SINCE YOU HAD THE LETTER
WE SHOULD HAVE
ACTED BEFORE THIS
YOU HAVE NO FURTHER EVIDENCE I SUPPOSE THAN
THAT WHICH YOU HAVE PLACED BEFORE US NO SUGGESTIVE DETAIL WHICH
MIGHT HELP US
THERE IS ONE THING SAID JOHN OPENSHAW
HE RUMMAGED IN HIS COAT
POCKET AND DRAWING OUT A PIECE OF DISCOLOURED BLUE TINTED
PAPER HE LAID IT OUT UPON THE TABLE
I HAVE SOME REMEMBRANCE
SAID HE THAT ON THE DAY WHEN MY UNCLE BURNED THE PAPERS I
OBSERVED THAT THE SMALL UNBURNED MARGINS WHICH LAY AMID THE
ASHES WERE OF THIS PARTICULAR COLOUR
I FOUND THIS SINGLE SHEET
UPON THE FLOOR OF HIS ROOM AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT
MAY BE ONE OF THE PAPERS WHICH HAS PERHAPS FLUTTERED OUT FROM
AMONG THE OTHERS AND IN THAT WAY HAS ESCAPED DESTRUCTION
BEYOND
THE MENTION OF PIPS I DO NOT SEE THAT IT HELPS US MUCH
I THINK
MYSELF THAT IT IS A PAGE FROM SOME PRIVATE DIARY
THE WRITING IS
UNDOUBTEDLY MY UNCLE'S
HOLMES MOVED THE LAMP AND WE BOTH BENT OVER THE SHEET OF PAPER
WHICH SHOWED BY ITS RAGGED EDGE THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN TORN FROM
A BOOK
IT WAS HEADED MARCH 1869 AND BENEATH WERE THE
FOLLOWING ENIGMATICAL NOTICES
4TH
HUDSON CAME
SAME OLD PLATFORM
7TH
SET THE PIPS ON MCCAULEY PARAMORE AND
JOHN SWAIN OF ST
AUGUSTINE
9TH
MCCAULEY CLEARED
10TH
JOHN SWAIN CLEARED
12TH
VISITED PARAMORE
ALL WELL
THANK YOU SAID HOLMES FOLDING UP THE PAPER AND RETURNING IT
TO OUR VISITOR
AND NOW YOU MUST ON NO ACCOUNT LOSE ANOTHER
INSTANT
WE CANNOT SPARE TIME EVEN TO DISCUSS WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD
ME
YOU MUST GET HOME INSTANTLY AND ACT
WHAT SHALL I DO
THERE IS BUT ONE THING TO DO
IT MUST BE DONE AT ONCE
YOU MUST
PUT THIS PIECE OF PAPER WHICH YOU HAVE SHOWN US INTO THE BRASS
BOX WHICH YOU HAVE DESCRIBED
YOU MUST ALSO PUT IN A NOTE TO SAY
THAT ALL THE OTHER PAPERS WERE BURNED BY YOUR UNCLE AND THAT
THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH REMAINS
YOU MUST ASSERT THAT IN SUCH
WORDS AS WILL CARRY CONVICTION WITH THEM
HAVING DONE THIS YOU
MUST AT ONCE PUT THE BOX OUT UPON THE SUNDIAL AS DIRECTED
DO
YOU UNDERSTAND
ENTIRELY
DO NOT THINK OF REVENGE OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT AT PRESENT
I
THINK THAT WE MAY GAIN THAT BY MEANS OF THE LAW BUT WE HAVE OUR
WEB TO WEAVE WHILE THEIRS IS ALREADY WOVEN
THE FIRST
CONSIDERATION IS TO REMOVE THE PRESSING DANGER WHICH THREATENS
YOU
THE SECOND IS TO CLEAR UP THE MYSTERY AND TO PUNISH THE
GUILTY PARTIES
I THANK YOU SAID THE YOUNG MAN RISING AND PULLING ON HIS
OVERCOAT
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME FRESH LIFE AND HOPE
I SHALL
CERTAINLY DO AS YOU ADVISE
DO NOT LOSE AN INSTANT
AND ABOVE ALL TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF IN
THE MEANWHILE FOR I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE CAN BE A DOUBT THAT
YOU ARE THREATENED BY A VERY REAL AND IMMINENT DANGER
HOW DO YOU
GO BACK
BY TRAIN FROM WATERLOO
IT IS NOT YET NINE
THE STREETS WILL BE CROWDED SO I TRUST THAT
YOU MAY BE IN SAFETY
AND YET YOU CANNOT GUARD YOURSELF TOO
CLOSELY
I AM ARMED
THAT IS WELL
TO MORROW I SHALL SET TO WORK UPON YOUR CASE
I SHALL SEE YOU AT HORSHAM THEN
NO YOUR SECRET LIES IN LONDON
IT IS THERE THAT I SHALL SEEK
IT
THEN I SHALL CALL UPON YOU IN A DAY OR IN TWO DAYS WITH NEWS
AS TO THE BOX AND THE PAPERS
I SHALL TAKE YOUR ADVICE IN EVERY
PARTICULAR HE SHOOK HANDS WITH US AND TOOK HIS LEAVE
OUTSIDE
THE WIND STILL SCREAMED AND THE RAIN SPLASHED AND PATTERED
AGAINST THE WINDOWS
THIS STRANGE WILD STORY SEEMED TO HAVE COME
TO US FROM AMID THE MAD ELEMENTS BLOWN IN UPON US LIKE A SHEET
OF SEA WEED IN A GALE AND NOW TO HAVE BEEN REABSORBED BY THEM
ONCE MORE
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK
FORWARD AND HIS EYES BENT UPON THE RED GLOW OF THE FIRE
THEN HE
LIT HIS PIPE AND LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR HE WATCHED THE BLUE
SMOKE RINGS AS THEY CHASED EACH OTHER UP TO THE CEILING
I THINK WATSON HE REMARKED AT LAST THAT OF ALL OUR CASES WE
HAVE HAD NONE MORE FANTASTIC THAN THIS
SAVE PERHAPS THE SIGN OF FOUR
WELL YES
SAVE PERHAPS THAT
AND YET THIS JOHN OPENSHAW SEEMS
TO ME TO BE WALKING AMID EVEN GREATER PERILS THAN DID THE
SHOLTOS
BUT HAVE YOU I ASKED FORMED ANY DEFINITE CONCEPTION AS TO
WHAT THESE PERILS ARE
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AS TO THEIR NATURE HE ANSWERED
THEN WHAT ARE THEY WHO IS THIS K
K
K AND WHY DOES HE PURSUE
THIS UNHAPPY FAMILY
SHERLOCK HOLMES CLOSED HIS EYES AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS UPON THE
ARMS OF HIS CHAIR WITH HIS FINGER TIPS TOGETHER
THE IDEAL
REASONER HE REMARKED WOULD WHEN HE HAD ONCE BEEN SHOWN A
SINGLE FACT IN ALL ITS BEARINGS DEDUCE FROM IT NOT ONLY ALL THE
CHAIN OF EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO IT BUT ALSO ALL THE RESULTS WHICH
WOULD FOLLOW FROM IT
AS CUVIER COULD CORRECTLY DESCRIBE A WHOLE
ANIMAL BY THE CONTEMPLATION OF A SINGLE BONE SO THE OBSERVER WHO
HAS THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD ONE LINK IN A SERIES OF INCIDENTS
SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY STATE ALL THE OTHER ONES BOTH
BEFORE AND AFTER
WE HAVE NOT YET GRASPED THE RESULTS WHICH THE
REASON ALONE CAN ATTAIN TO
PROBLEMS MAY BE SOLVED IN THE STUDY
WHICH HAVE BAFFLED ALL THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT A SOLUTION BY THE
AID OF THEIR SENSES
TO CARRY THE ART HOWEVER TO ITS HIGHEST
PITCH IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE REASONER SHOULD BE ABLE TO
UTILISE ALL THE FACTS WHICH HAVE COME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE AND THIS
IN ITSELF IMPLIES AS YOU WILL READILY SEE A POSSESSION OF ALL
KNOWLEDGE WHICH EVEN IN THESE DAYS OF FREE EDUCATION AND
ENCYCLOPAEDIAS IS A SOMEWHAT RARE ACCOMPLISHMENT
IT IS NOT SO
IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT A MAN SHOULD POSSESS ALL KNOWLEDGE
WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE USEFUL TO HIM IN HIS WORK AND THIS I HAVE
ENDEAVOURED IN MY CASE TO DO
IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY YOU ON ONE
OCCASION IN THE EARLY DAYS OF OUR FRIENDSHIP DEFINED MY LIMITS
IN A VERY PRECISE FASHION
YES I ANSWERED LAUGHING
IT WAS A SINGULAR DOCUMENT
PHILOSOPHY ASTRONOMY AND POLITICS WERE MARKED AT ZERO I
REMEMBER
BOTANY VARIABLE GEOLOGY PROFOUND AS REGARDS THE
MUD STAINS FROM ANY REGION WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF TOWN CHEMISTRY
ECCENTRIC ANATOMY UNSYSTEMATIC SENSATIONAL LITERATURE AND CRIME
RECORDS UNIQUE VIOLIN PLAYER BOXER SWORDSMAN LAWYER AND
SELF POISONER BY COCAINE AND TOBACCO
THOSE I THINK WERE THE
MAIN POINTS OF MY ANALYSIS
HOLMES GRINNED AT THE LAST ITEM
WELL HE SAID I SAY NOW AS
I SAID THEN THAT A MAN SHOULD KEEP HIS LITTLE BRAIN ATTIC
STOCKED WITH ALL THE FURNITURE THAT HE IS LIKELY TO USE AND THE
REST HE CAN PUT AWAY IN THE LUMBER ROOM OF HIS LIBRARY WHERE HE
CAN GET IT IF HE WANTS IT
NOW FOR SUCH A CASE AS THE ONE WHICH
HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO US TO NIGHT WE NEED CERTAINLY TO MUSTER
ALL OUR RESOURCES
KINDLY HAND ME DOWN THE LETTER K OF THE
'AMERICAN ENCYCLOPAEDIA' WHICH STANDS UPON THE SHELF BESIDE YOU
THANK YOU
NOW LET US CONSIDER THE SITUATION AND SEE WHAT MAY BE
DEDUCED FROM IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MAY START WITH A STRONG
PRESUMPTION THAT COLONEL OPENSHAW HAD SOME VERY STRONG REASON FOR
LEAVING AMERICA
MEN AT HIS TIME OF LIFE DO NOT CHANGE ALL THEIR
HABITS AND EXCHANGE WILLINGLY THE CHARMING CLIMATE OF FLORIDA FOR
THE LONELY LIFE OF AN ENGLISH PROVINCIAL TOWN
HIS EXTREME LOVE
OF SOLITUDE IN ENGLAND SUGGESTS THE IDEA THAT HE WAS IN FEAR OF
SOMEONE OR SOMETHING SO WE MAY ASSUME AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS
THAT IT WAS FEAR OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WHICH DROVE HIM FROM
AMERICA
AS TO WHAT IT WAS HE FEARED WE CAN ONLY DEDUCE THAT BY
CONSIDERING THE FORMIDABLE LETTERS WHICH WERE RECEIVED BY HIMSELF
AND HIS SUCCESSORS
DID YOU REMARK THE POSTMARKS OF THOSE
LETTERS
THE FIRST WAS FROM PONDICHERRY THE SECOND FROM DUNDEE AND THE
THIRD FROM LONDON
FROM EAST LONDON
WHAT DO YOU DEDUCE FROM THAT
THEY ARE ALL SEAPORTS
THAT THE WRITER WAS ON BOARD OF A SHIP
EXCELLENT
WE HAVE ALREADY A CLUE
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT
THE PROBABILITY THE STRONG PROBABILITY IS THAT THE WRITER WAS
ON BOARD OF A SHIP
AND NOW LET US CONSIDER ANOTHER POINT
IN THE
CASE OF PONDICHERRY SEVEN WEEKS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE THREAT AND
ITS FULFILMENT IN DUNDEE IT WAS ONLY SOME THREE OR FOUR DAYS
DOES THAT SUGGEST ANYTHING
A GREATER DISTANCE TO TRAVEL
BUT THE LETTER HAD ALSO A GREATER DISTANCE TO COME
THEN I DO NOT SEE THE POINT
THERE IS AT LEAST A PRESUMPTION THAT THE VESSEL IN WHICH THE MAN
OR MEN ARE IS A SAILING SHIP
IT LOOKS AS IF THEY ALWAYS SEND
THEIR SINGULAR WARNING OR TOKEN BEFORE THEM WHEN STARTING UPON
THEIR MISSION
YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY THE DEED FOLLOWED THE SIGN
WHEN IT CAME FROM DUNDEE
IF THEY HAD COME FROM PONDICHERRY IN A
STEAMER THEY WOULD HAVE ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS THEIR LETTER
BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT SEVEN WEEKS ELAPSED
I THINK THAT THOSE
SEVEN WEEKS REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAIL BOAT WHICH
BROUGHT THE LETTER AND THE SAILING VESSEL WHICH BROUGHT THE
WRITER
IT IS POSSIBLE
MORE THAN THAT
IT IS PROBABLE
AND NOW YOU SEE THE DEADLY
URGENCY OF THIS NEW CASE AND WHY I URGED YOUNG OPENSHAW TO
CAUTION
THE BLOW HAS ALWAYS FALLEN AT THE END OF THE TIME WHICH
IT WOULD TAKE THE SENDERS TO TRAVEL THE DISTANCE
BUT THIS ONE
COMES FROM LONDON AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT COUNT UPON DELAY
GOOD GOD I CRIED
WHAT CAN IT MEAN THIS RELENTLESS
PERSECUTION
THE PAPERS WHICH OPENSHAW CARRIED ARE OBVIOUSLY OF VITAL
IMPORTANCE TO THE PERSON OR PERSONS IN THE SAILING SHIP
I THINK
THAT IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THERE MUST BE MORE THAN ONE OF THEM
A SINGLE MAN COULD NOT HAVE CARRIED OUT TWO DEATHS IN SUCH A WAY
AS TO DECEIVE A CORONER'S JURY
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL IN
IT AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN MEN OF RESOURCE AND DETERMINATION
THEIR PAPERS THEY MEAN TO HAVE BE THE HOLDER OF THEM WHO IT MAY
IN THIS WAY YOU SEE K
K
K
CEASES TO BE THE INITIALS OF AN
INDIVIDUAL AND BECOMES THE BADGE OF A SOCIETY
BUT OF WHAT SOCIETY
HAVE YOU NEVER SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES BENDING FORWARD AND
SINKING HIS VOICE HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD OF THE KU KLUX KLAN
I NEVER HAVE
HOLMES TURNED OVER THE LEAVES OF THE BOOK UPON HIS KNEE
HERE IT
IS SAID HE PRESENTLY
'KU KLUX KLAN
A NAME DERIVED FROM THE FANCIFUL RESEMBLANCE TO
THE SOUND PRODUCED BY COCKING A RIFLE
THIS TERRIBLE SECRET
SOCIETY WAS FORMED BY SOME EX CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS IN THE
SOUTHERN STATES AFTER THE CIVIL WAR AND IT RAPIDLY FORMED LOCAL
BRANCHES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY NOTABLY IN TENNESSEE
LOUISIANA THE CAROLINAS GEORGIA AND FLORIDA
ITS POWER WAS
USED FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES PRINCIPALLY FOR THE TERRORISING OF
THE NEGRO VOTERS AND THE MURDERING AND DRIVING FROM THE COUNTRY
OF THOSE WHO WERE OPPOSED TO ITS VIEWS
ITS OUTRAGES WERE USUALLY
PRECEDED BY A WARNING SENT TO THE MARKED MAN IN SOME FANTASTIC
BUT GENERALLY RECOGNISED SHAPE A SPRIG OF OAK LEAVES IN SOME
PARTS MELON SEEDS OR ORANGE PIPS IN OTHERS
ON RECEIVING THIS
THE VICTIM MIGHT EITHER OPENLY ABJURE HIS FORMER WAYS OR MIGHT
FLY FROM THE COUNTRY
IF HE BRAVED THE MATTER OUT DEATH WOULD
UNFAILINGLY COME UPON HIM AND USUALLY IN SOME STRANGE AND
UNFORESEEN MANNER
SO PERFECT WAS THE ORGANISATION OF THE
SOCIETY AND SO SYSTEMATIC ITS METHODS THAT THERE IS HARDLY A
CASE UPON RECORD WHERE ANY MAN SUCCEEDED IN BRAVING IT WITH
IMPUNITY OR IN WHICH ANY OF ITS OUTRAGES WERE TRACED HOME TO THE
PERPETRATORS
FOR SOME YEARS THE ORGANISATION FLOURISHED IN SPITE
OF THE EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND OF THE BETTER
CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE SOUTH
EVENTUALLY IN THE YEAR
1869 THE MOVEMENT RATHER SUDDENLY COLLAPSED ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE
BEEN SPORADIC OUTBREAKS OF THE SAME SORT SINCE THAT DATE
YOU WILL OBSERVE SAID HOLMES LAYING DOWN THE VOLUME THAT
THE SUDDEN BREAKING UP OF THE SOCIETY WAS COINCIDENT WITH THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF OPENSHAW FROM AMERICA WITH THEIR PAPERS
IT MAY
WELL HAVE BEEN CAUSE AND EFFECT
IT IS NO WONDER THAT HE AND HIS
FAMILY HAVE SOME OF THE MORE IMPLACABLE SPIRITS UPON THEIR TRACK
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS REGISTER AND DIARY MAY IMPLICATE
SOME OF THE FIRST MEN IN THE SOUTH AND THAT THERE MAY BE MANY
WHO WILL NOT SLEEP EASY AT NIGHT UNTIL IT IS RECOVERED
THEN THE PAGE WE HAVE SEEN
IS SUCH AS WE MIGHT EXPECT
IT RAN IF I REMEMBER RIGHT 'SENT
THE PIPS TO A B AND C' THAT IS SENT THE SOCIETY'S WARNING TO
THEM
THEN THERE ARE SUCCESSIVE ENTRIES THAT A AND B CLEARED OR
LEFT THE COUNTRY AND FINALLY THAT C WAS VISITED WITH I FEAR A
SINISTER RESULT FOR C
WELL I THINK DOCTOR THAT WE MAY LET
SOME LIGHT INTO THIS DARK PLACE AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY
CHANCE YOUNG OPENSHAW HAS IN THE MEANTIME IS TO DO WHAT I HAVE
TOLD HIM
THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID OR TO BE DONE
TO NIGHT SO HAND ME OVER MY VIOLIN AND LET US TRY TO FORGET FOR
HALF AN HOUR THE MISERABLE WEATHER AND THE STILL MORE MISERABLE
WAYS OF OUR FELLOW MEN
IT HAD CLEARED IN THE MORNING AND THE SUN WAS SHINING WITH A
SUBDUED BRIGHTNESS THROUGH THE DIM VEIL WHICH HANGS OVER THE
GREAT CITY
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS ALREADY AT BREAKFAST WHEN I CAME
DOWN
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME FOR NOT WAITING FOR YOU SAID HE I HAVE I
FORESEE A VERY BUSY DAY BEFORE ME IN LOOKING INTO THIS CASE OF
YOUNG OPENSHAW'S
WHAT STEPS WILL YOU TAKE I ASKED
IT WILL VERY MUCH DEPEND UPON THE RESULTS OF MY FIRST INQUIRIES
I MAY HAVE TO GO DOWN TO HORSHAM AFTER ALL
YOU WILL NOT GO THERE FIRST
NO I SHALL COMMENCE WITH THE CITY
JUST RING THE BELL AND THE
MAID WILL BRING UP YOUR COFFEE
AS I WAITED I LIFTED THE UNOPENED NEWSPAPER FROM THE TABLE AND
GLANCED MY EYE OVER IT
IT RESTED UPON A HEADING WHICH SENT A
CHILL TO MY HEART
HOLMES I CRIED YOU ARE TOO LATE
AH SAID HE LAYING DOWN HIS CUP I FEARED AS MUCH
HOW WAS IT
DONE HE SPOKE CALMLY BUT I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS DEEPLY MOVED
MY EYE CAUGHT THE NAME OF OPENSHAW AND THE HEADING 'TRAGEDY
NEAR WATERLOO BRIDGE HERE IS THE ACCOUNT
BETWEEN NINE AND TEN LAST NIGHT POLICE CONSTABLE COOK OF THE H
DIVISION ON DUTY NEAR WATERLOO BRIDGE HEARD A CRY FOR HELP AND
A SPLASH IN THE WATER
THE NIGHT HOWEVER WAS EXTREMELY DARK AND
STORMY SO THAT IN SPITE OF THE HELP OF SEVERAL PASSERS BY IT
WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO EFFECT A RESCUE
THE ALARM HOWEVER WAS
GIVEN AND BY THE AID OF THE WATER POLICE THE BODY WAS
EVENTUALLY RECOVERED
IT PROVED TO BE THAT OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN
WHOSE NAME AS IT APPEARS FROM AN ENVELOPE WHICH WAS FOUND IN HIS
POCKET WAS JOHN OPENSHAW AND WHOSE RESIDENCE IS NEAR HORSHAM
IT IS CONJECTURED THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN HURRYING DOWN TO CATCH
THE LAST TRAIN FROM WATERLOO STATION AND THAT IN HIS HASTE AND
THE EXTREME DARKNESS HE MISSED HIS PATH AND WALKED OVER THE EDGE
OF ONE OF THE SMALL LANDING PLACES FOR RIVER STEAMBOATS
THE BODY
EXHIBITED NO TRACES OF VIOLENCE AND THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT
THE DECEASED HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT
WHICH SHOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF CALLING THE ATTENTION OF THE
AUTHORITIES TO THE CONDITION OF THE RIVERSIDE LANDING STAGES
WE SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME MINUTES HOLMES MORE DEPRESSED AND
SHAKEN THAN I HAD EVER SEEN HIM
THAT HURTS MY PRIDE WATSON HE SAID AT LAST
IT IS A PETTY
FEELING NO DOUBT BUT IT HURTS MY PRIDE
IT BECOMES A PERSONAL
MATTER WITH ME NOW AND IF GOD SENDS ME HEALTH I SHALL SET MY
HAND UPON THIS GANG
THAT HE SHOULD COME TO ME FOR HELP AND THAT
I SHOULD SEND HIM AWAY TO HIS DEATH HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR
AND PACED ABOUT THE ROOM IN UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION WITH A
FLUSH UPON HIS SALLOW CHEEKS AND A NERVOUS CLASPING AND
UNCLASPING OF HIS LONG THIN HANDS
THEY MUST BE CUNNING DEVILS HE EXCLAIMED AT LAST
HOW COULD
THEY HAVE DECOYED HIM DOWN THERE THE EMBANKMENT IS NOT ON THE
DIRECT LINE TO THE STATION
THE BRIDGE NO DOUBT WAS TOO
CROWDED EVEN ON SUCH A NIGHT FOR THEIR PURPOSE
WELL WATSON
WE SHALL SEE WHO WILL WIN IN THE LONG RUN
I AM GOING OUT NOW
TO THE POLICE
NO I SHALL BE MY OWN POLICE
WHEN I HAVE SPUN THE WEB THEY MAY
TAKE THE FLIES BUT NOT BEFORE
ALL DAY I WAS ENGAGED IN MY PROFESSIONAL WORK AND IT WAS LATE IN
THE EVENING BEFORE I RETURNED TO BAKER STREET
SHERLOCK HOLMES
HAD NOT COME BACK YET
IT WAS NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK BEFORE HE
ENTERED LOOKING PALE AND WORN
HE WALKED UP TO THE SIDEBOARD
AND TEARING A PIECE FROM THE LOAF HE DEVOURED IT VORACIOUSLY
WASHING IT DOWN WITH A LONG DRAUGHT OF WATER
YOU ARE HUNGRY I REMARKED
STARVING
IT HAD ESCAPED MY MEMORY
I HAVE HAD NOTHING SINCE
BREAKFAST
NOTHING
NOT A BITE
I HAD NO TIME TO THINK OF IT
AND HOW HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED
WELL
YOU HAVE A CLUE
I HAVE THEM IN THE HOLLOW OF MY HAND
YOUNG OPENSHAW SHALL NOT
LONG REMAIN UNAVENGED
WHY WATSON LET US PUT THEIR OWN DEVILISH
TRADE MARK UPON THEM
IT IS WELL THOUGHT OF
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE TOOK AN ORANGE FROM THE CUPBOARD AND TEARING IT TO PIECES HE
SQUEEZED OUT THE PIPS UPON THE TABLE
OF THESE HE TOOK FIVE AND
THRUST THEM INTO AN ENVELOPE
ON THE INSIDE OF THE FLAP HE WROTE
S
H
FOR J
O THEN HE SEALED IT AND ADDRESSED IT TO CAPTAIN
JAMES CALHOUN BARQUE 'LONE STAR SAVANNAH GEORGIA
THAT WILL AWAIT HIM WHEN HE ENTERS PORT SAID HE CHUCKLING
IT MAY GIVE HIM A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
HE WILL FIND IT AS SURE A
PRECURSOR OF HIS FATE AS OPENSHAW DID BEFORE HIM
AND WHO IS THIS CAPTAIN CALHOUN
THE LEADER OF THE GANG
I SHALL HAVE THE OTHERS BUT HE FIRST
HOW DID YOU TRACE IT THEN
HE TOOK A LARGE SHEET OF PAPER FROM HIS POCKET ALL COVERED WITH
DATES AND NAMES
I HAVE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY SAID HE OVER LLOYD'S REGISTERS
AND FILES OF THE OLD PAPERS FOLLOWING THE FUTURE CAREER OF EVERY
VESSEL WHICH TOUCHED AT PONDICHERRY IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY IN
'83
THERE WERE THIRTY SIX SHIPS OF FAIR TONNAGE WHICH WERE
REPORTED THERE DURING THOSE MONTHS
OF THESE ONE THE 'LONE STAR
INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION SINCE ALTHOUGH IT WAS REPORTED
AS HAVING CLEARED FROM LONDON THE NAME IS THAT WHICH IS GIVEN TO
ONE OF THE STATES OF THE UNION
TEXAS I THINK
I WAS NOT AND AM NOT SURE WHICH BUT I KNEW THAT THE SHIP MUST
HAVE AN AMERICAN ORIGIN
WHAT THEN
I SEARCHED THE DUNDEE RECORDS AND WHEN I FOUND THAT THE BARQUE
'LONE STAR' WAS THERE IN JANUARY '85 MY SUSPICION BECAME A
CERTAINTY
I THEN INQUIRED AS TO THE VESSELS WHICH LAY AT PRESENT
IN THE PORT OF LONDON
YES
THE 'LONE STAR' HAD ARRIVED HERE LAST WEEK
I WENT DOWN TO THE
ALBERT DOCK AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN THE RIVER BY
THE EARLY TIDE THIS MORNING HOMEWARD BOUND TO SAVANNAH
I WIRED
TO GRAVESEND AND LEARNED THAT SHE HAD PASSED SOME TIME AGO AND
AS THE WIND IS EASTERLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE IS NOW PAST THE
GOODWINS AND NOT VERY FAR FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT
WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN
OH I HAVE MY HAND UPON HIM
HE AND THE TWO MATES ARE AS I
LEARN THE ONLY NATIVE BORN AMERICANS IN THE SHIP
THE OTHERS ARE
FINNS AND GERMANS
I KNOW ALSO THAT THEY WERE ALL THREE AWAY
FROM THE SHIP LAST NIGHT
I HAD IT FROM THE STEVEDORE WHO HAS
BEEN LOADING THEIR CARGO
BY THE TIME THAT THEIR SAILING SHIP
REACHES SAVANNAH THE MAIL BOAT WILL HAVE CARRIED THIS LETTER AND
THE CABLE WILL HAVE INFORMED THE POLICE OF SAVANNAH THAT THESE
THREE GENTLEMEN ARE BADLY WANTED HERE UPON A CHARGE OF MURDER
THERE IS EVER A FLAW HOWEVER IN THE BEST LAID OF HUMAN PLANS
AND THE MURDERERS OF JOHN OPENSHAW WERE NEVER TO RECEIVE THE
ORANGE PIPS WHICH WOULD SHOW THEM THAT ANOTHER AS CUNNING AND AS
RESOLUTE AS THEMSELVES WAS UPON THEIR TRACK
VERY LONG AND VERY
SEVERE WERE THE EQUINOCTIAL GALES THAT YEAR
WE WAITED LONG FOR
NEWS OF THE LONE STAR OF SAVANNAH BUT NONE EVER REACHED US
WE
DID AT LAST HEAR THAT SOMEWHERE FAR OUT IN THE ATLANTIC A
SHATTERED STERN POST OF A BOAT WAS SEEN SWINGING IN THE TROUGH
OF A WAVE WITH THE LETTERS L
S CARVED UPON IT AND THAT IS
ALL WHICH WE SHALL EVER KNOW OF THE FATE OF THE LONE STAR
ADVENTURE VI
THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
ISA WHITNEY BROTHER OF THE LATE ELIAS WHITNEY D D PRINCIPAL
OF THE THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE OF ST
GEORGE'S WAS MUCH ADDICTED TO
OPIUM
THE HABIT GREW UPON HIM AS I UNDERSTAND FROM SOME
FOOLISH FREAK WHEN HE WAS AT COLLEGE FOR HAVING READ DE
QUINCEY'S DESCRIPTION OF HIS DREAMS AND SENSATIONS HE HAD
DRENCHED HIS TOBACCO WITH LAUDANUM IN AN ATTEMPT TO PRODUCE THE
SAME EFFECTS
HE FOUND AS SO MANY MORE HAVE DONE THAT THE
PRACTICE IS EASIER TO ATTAIN THAN TO GET RID OF AND FOR MANY
YEARS HE CONTINUED TO BE A SLAVE TO THE DRUG AN OBJECT OF
MINGLED HORROR AND PITY TO HIS FRIENDS AND RELATIVES
I CAN SEE
HIM NOW WITH YELLOW PASTY FACE DROOPING LIDS AND PIN POINT
PUPILS ALL HUDDLED IN A CHAIR THE WRECK AND RUIN OF A NOBLE
MAN
ONE NIGHT IT WAS IN JUNE '89 THERE CAME A RING TO MY BELL
ABOUT THE HOUR WHEN A MAN GIVES HIS FIRST YAWN AND GLANCES AT THE
CLOCK
I SAT UP IN MY CHAIR AND MY WIFE LAID HER NEEDLE WORK
DOWN IN HER LAP AND MADE A LITTLE FACE OF DISAPPOINTMENT
A PATIENT SAID SHE
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO OUT
I GROANED FOR I WAS NEWLY COME BACK FROM A WEARY DAY
WE HEARD THE DOOR OPEN A FEW HURRIED WORDS AND THEN QUICK STEPS
UPON THE LINOLEUM
OUR OWN DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A LADY CLAD IN
SOME DARK COLOURED STUFF WITH A BLACK VEIL ENTERED THE ROOM
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY CALLING SO LATE SHE BEGAN AND THEN
SUDDENLY LOSING HER SELF CONTROL SHE RAN FORWARD THREW HER ARMS
ABOUT MY WIFE'S NECK AND SOBBED UPON HER SHOULDER
OH I'M IN
SUCH TROUBLE SHE CRIED I DO SO WANT A LITTLE HELP
WHY SAID MY WIFE PULLING UP HER VEIL IT IS KATE WHITNEY
HOW YOU STARTLED ME KATE I HAD NOT AN IDEA WHO YOU WERE WHEN
YOU CAME IN
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I CAME STRAIGHT TO YOU THAT WAS
ALWAYS THE WAY
FOLK WHO WERE IN GRIEF CAME TO MY WIFE LIKE BIRDS
TO A LIGHT HOUSE
IT WAS VERY SWEET OF YOU TO COME
NOW YOU MUST HAVE SOME WINE
AND WATER AND SIT HERE COMFORTABLY AND TELL US ALL ABOUT IT
OR
SHOULD YOU RATHER THAT I SENT JAMES OFF TO BED
OH NO NO I WANT THE DOCTOR'S ADVICE AND HELP TOO
IT'S ABOUT
ISA
HE HAS NOT BEEN HOME FOR TWO DAYS
I AM SO FRIGHTENED ABOUT
HIM
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TO US OF HER
HUSBAND'S TROUBLE TO ME AS A DOCTOR TO MY WIFE AS AN OLD FRIEND
AND SCHOOL COMPANION
WE SOOTHED AND COMFORTED HER BY SUCH WORDS
AS WE COULD FIND
DID SHE KNOW WHERE HER HUSBAND WAS WAS IT
POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD BRING HIM BACK TO HER
IT SEEMS THAT IT WAS
SHE HAD THE SUREST INFORMATION THAT OF LATE
HE HAD WHEN THE FIT WAS ON HIM MADE USE OF AN OPIUM DEN IN THE
FARTHEST EAST OF THE CITY
HITHERTO HIS ORGIES HAD ALWAYS BEEN
CONFINED TO ONE DAY AND HE HAD COME BACK TWITCHING AND
SHATTERED IN THE EVENING
BUT NOW THE SPELL HAD BEEN UPON HIM
EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS AND HE LAY THERE DOUBTLESS AMONG THE
DREGS OF THE DOCKS BREATHING IN THE POISON OR SLEEPING OFF THE
EFFECTS
THERE HE WAS TO BE FOUND SHE WAS SURE OF IT AT THE BAR
OF GOLD IN UPPER SWANDAM LANE
BUT WHAT WAS SHE TO DO HOW COULD
SHE A YOUNG AND TIMID WOMAN MAKE HER WAY INTO SUCH A PLACE AND
PLUCK HER HUSBAND OUT FROM AMONG THE RUFFIANS WHO SURROUNDED HIM
THERE WAS THE CASE AND OF COURSE THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY OUT OF
IT
MIGHT I NOT ESCORT HER TO THIS PLACE AND THEN AS A SECOND
THOUGHT WHY SHOULD SHE COME AT ALL I WAS ISA WHITNEY'S MEDICAL
ADVISER AND AS SUCH I HAD INFLUENCE OVER HIM
I COULD MANAGE IT
BETTER IF I WERE ALONE
I PROMISED HER ON MY WORD THAT I WOULD
SEND HIM HOME IN A CAB WITHIN TWO HOURS IF HE WERE INDEED AT THE
ADDRESS WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN ME
AND SO IN TEN MINUTES I HAD LEFT
MY ARMCHAIR AND CHEERY SITTING ROOM BEHIND ME AND WAS SPEEDING
EASTWARD IN A HANSOM ON A STRANGE ERRAND AS IT SEEMED TO ME AT
THE TIME THOUGH THE FUTURE ONLY COULD SHOW HOW STRANGE IT WAS TO
BE
BUT THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THE FIRST STAGE OF MY
ADVENTURE
UPPER SWANDAM LANE IS A VILE ALLEY LURKING BEHIND THE
HIGH WHARVES WHICH LINE THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER TO THE EAST
OF LONDON BRIDGE
BETWEEN A SLOP SHOP AND A GIN SHOP APPROACHED
BY A STEEP FLIGHT OF STEPS LEADING DOWN TO A BLACK GAP LIKE THE
MOUTH OF A CAVE I FOUND THE DEN OF WHICH I WAS IN SEARCH
ORDERING MY CAB TO WAIT I PASSED DOWN THE STEPS WORN HOLLOW IN
THE CENTRE BY THE CEASELESS TREAD OF DRUNKEN FEET AND BY THE
LIGHT OF A FLICKERING OIL LAMP ABOVE THE DOOR I FOUND THE LATCH
AND MADE MY WAY INTO A LONG LOW ROOM THICK AND HEAVY WITH THE
BROWN OPIUM SMOKE AND TERRACED WITH WOODEN BERTHS LIKE THE
FORECASTLE OF AN EMIGRANT SHIP
THROUGH THE GLOOM ONE COULD DIMLY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF BODIES LYING
IN STRANGE FANTASTIC POSES BOWED SHOULDERS BENT KNEES HEADS
THROWN BACK AND CHINS POINTING UPWARD WITH HERE AND THERE A
DARK LACK LUSTRE EYE TURNED UPON THE NEWCOMER
OUT OF THE BLACK
SHADOWS THERE GLIMMERED LITTLE RED CIRCLES OF LIGHT NOW BRIGHT
NOW FAINT AS THE BURNING POISON WAXED OR WANED IN THE BOWLS OF
THE METAL PIPES
THE MOST LAY SILENT BUT SOME MUTTERED TO
THEMSELVES AND OTHERS TALKED TOGETHER IN A STRANGE LOW
MONOTONOUS VOICE THEIR CONVERSATION COMING IN GUSHES AND THEN
SUDDENLY TAILING OFF INTO SILENCE EACH MUMBLING OUT HIS OWN
THOUGHTS AND PAYING LITTLE HEED TO THE WORDS OF HIS NEIGHBOUR
AT
THE FARTHER END WAS A SMALL BRAZIER OF BURNING CHARCOAL BESIDE
WHICH ON A THREE LEGGED WOODEN STOOL THERE SAT A TALL THIN OLD
MAN WITH HIS JAW RESTING UPON HIS TWO FISTS AND HIS ELBOWS UPON
HIS KNEES STARING INTO THE FIRE
AS I ENTERED A SALLOW MALAY ATTENDANT HAD HURRIED UP WITH A PIPE
FOR ME AND A SUPPLY OF THE DRUG BECKONING ME TO AN EMPTY BERTH
THANK YOU
I HAVE NOT COME TO STAY SAID I
THERE IS A FRIEND
OF MINE HERE MR
ISA WHITNEY AND I WISH TO SPEAK WITH HIM
THERE WAS A MOVEMENT AND AN EXCLAMATION FROM MY RIGHT AND
PEERING THROUGH THE GLOOM I SAW WHITNEY PALE HAGGARD AND
UNKEMPT STARING OUT AT ME
MY GOD IT'S WATSON SAID HE
HE WAS IN A PITIABLE STATE OF
REACTION WITH EVERY NERVE IN A TWITTER
I SAY WATSON WHAT
O'CLOCK IS IT
NEARLY ELEVEN
OF WHAT DAY
OF FRIDAY JUNE 19TH
GOOD HEAVENS I THOUGHT IT WAS WEDNESDAY
IT IS WEDNESDAY
WHAT
D'YOU WANT TO FRIGHTEN A CHAP FOR HE SANK HIS FACE ONTO HIS
ARMS AND BEGAN TO SOB IN A HIGH TREBLE KEY
I TELL YOU THAT IT IS FRIDAY MAN
YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN WAITING
THIS TWO DAYS FOR YOU
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF
SO I AM
BUT YOU'VE GOT MIXED WATSON FOR I HAVE ONLY BEEN HERE
A FEW HOURS THREE PIPES FOUR PIPES I FORGET HOW MANY
BUT I'LL
GO HOME WITH YOU
I WOULDN'T FRIGHTEN KATE POOR LITTLE KATE
GIVE ME YOUR HAND HAVE YOU A CAB
YES I HAVE ONE WAITING
THEN I SHALL GO IN IT
BUT I MUST OWE SOMETHING
FIND WHAT I
OWE WATSON
I AM ALL OFF COLOUR
I CAN DO NOTHING FOR MYSELF
I WALKED DOWN THE NARROW PASSAGE BETWEEN THE DOUBLE ROW OF
SLEEPERS HOLDING MY BREATH TO KEEP OUT THE VILE STUPEFYING
FUMES OF THE DRUG AND LOOKING ABOUT FOR THE MANAGER
AS I PASSED
THE TALL MAN WHO SAT BY THE BRAZIER I FELT A SUDDEN PLUCK AT MY
SKIRT AND A LOW VOICE WHISPERED WALK PAST ME AND THEN LOOK
BACK AT ME THE WORDS FELL QUITE DISTINCTLY UPON MY EAR
I
GLANCED DOWN
THEY COULD ONLY HAVE COME FROM THE OLD MAN AT MY
SIDE AND YET HE SAT NOW AS ABSORBED AS EVER VERY THIN VERY
WRINKLED BENT WITH AGE AN OPIUM PIPE DANGLING DOWN FROM BETWEEN
HIS KNEES AS THOUGH IT HAD DROPPED IN SHEER LASSITUDE FROM HIS
FINGERS
I TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD AND LOOKED BACK
IT TOOK ALL MY
SELF CONTROL TO PREVENT ME FROM BREAKING OUT INTO A CRY OF
ASTONISHMENT
HE HAD TURNED HIS BACK SO THAT NONE COULD SEE HIM
BUT I
HIS FORM HAD FILLED OUT HIS WRINKLES WERE GONE THE DULL
EYES HAD REGAINED THEIR FIRE AND THERE SITTING BY THE FIRE AND
GRINNING AT MY SURPRISE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SHERLOCK HOLMES
HE
MADE A SLIGHT MOTION TO ME TO APPROACH HIM AND INSTANTLY AS HE
TURNED HIS FACE HALF ROUND TO THE COMPANY ONCE MORE SUBSIDED
INTO A DODDERING LOOSE LIPPED SENILITY
HOLMES I WHISPERED WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING IN THIS DEN
AS LOW AS YOU CAN HE ANSWERED I HAVE EXCELLENT EARS
IF YOU
WOULD HAVE THE GREAT KINDNESS TO GET RID OF THAT SOTTISH FRIEND
OF YOURS I SHOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK WITH
YOU
I HAVE A CAB OUTSIDE
THEN PRAY SEND HIM HOME IN IT
YOU MAY SAFELY TRUST HIM FOR HE
APPEARS TO BE TOO LIMP TO GET INTO ANY MISCHIEF
I SHOULD
RECOMMEND YOU ALSO TO SEND A NOTE BY THE CABMAN TO YOUR WIFE TO
SAY THAT YOU HAVE THROWN IN YOUR LOT WITH ME
IF YOU WILL WAIT
OUTSIDE I SHALL BE WITH YOU IN FIVE MINUTES
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REFUSE ANY OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' REQUESTS FOR
THEY WERE ALWAYS SO EXCEEDINGLY DEFINITE AND PUT FORWARD WITH
SUCH A QUIET AIR OF MASTERY
I FELT HOWEVER THAT WHEN WHITNEY
WAS ONCE CONFINED IN THE CAB MY MISSION WAS PRACTICALLY
ACCOMPLISHED AND FOR THE REST I COULD NOT WISH ANYTHING BETTER
THAN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MY FRIEND IN ONE OF THOSE SINGULAR
ADVENTURES WHICH WERE THE NORMAL CONDITION OF HIS EXISTENCE
IN A
FEW MINUTES I HAD WRITTEN MY NOTE PAID WHITNEY'S BILL LED HIM
OUT TO THE CAB AND SEEN HIM DRIVEN THROUGH THE DARKNESS
IN A
VERY SHORT TIME A DECREPIT FIGURE HAD EMERGED FROM THE OPIUM DEN
AND I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES
FOR TWO
STREETS HE SHUFFLED ALONG WITH A BENT BACK AND AN UNCERTAIN FOOT
THEN GLANCING QUICKLY ROUND HE STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF OUT AND
BURST INTO A HEARTY FIT OF LAUGHTER
I SUPPOSE WATSON SAID HE THAT YOU IMAGINE THAT I HAVE ADDED
OPIUM SMOKING TO COCAINE INJECTIONS AND ALL THE OTHER LITTLE
WEAKNESSES ON WHICH YOU HAVE FAVOURED ME WITH YOUR MEDICAL
VIEWS
I WAS CERTAINLY SURPRISED TO FIND YOU THERE
BUT NOT MORE SO THAN I TO FIND YOU
I CAME TO FIND A FRIEND
AND I TO FIND AN ENEMY
AN ENEMY
YES ONE OF MY NATURAL ENEMIES OR SHALL I SAY MY NATURAL
PREY
BRIEFLY WATSON I AM IN THE MIDST OF A VERY REMARKABLE
INQUIRY AND I HAVE HOPED TO FIND A CLUE IN THE INCOHERENT
RAMBLINGS OF THESE SOTS AS I HAVE DONE BEFORE NOW
HAD I BEEN
RECOGNISED IN THAT DEN MY LIFE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORTH AN
HOUR'S PURCHASE FOR I HAVE USED IT BEFORE NOW FOR MY OWN
PURPOSES AND THE RASCALLY LASCAR WHO RUNS IT HAS SWORN TO HAVE
VENGEANCE UPON ME
THERE IS A TRAP DOOR AT THE BACK OF THAT
BUILDING NEAR THE CORNER OF PAUL'S WHARF WHICH COULD TELL SOME
STRANGE TALES OF WHAT HAS PASSED THROUGH IT UPON THE MOONLESS
NIGHTS
WHAT YOU DO NOT MEAN BODIES
AY BODIES WATSON
WE SHOULD BE RICH MEN IF WE HAD 1000 POUNDS
FOR EVERY POOR DEVIL WHO HAS BEEN DONE TO DEATH IN THAT DEN
IT
IS THE VILEST MURDER TRAP ON THE WHOLE RIVERSIDE AND I FEAR THAT
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR HAS ENTERED IT NEVER TO LEAVE IT MORE
BUT OUR
TRAP SHOULD BE HERE HE PUT HIS TWO FOREFINGERS BETWEEN HIS
TEETH AND WHISTLED SHRILLY A SIGNAL WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY A
SIMILAR WHISTLE FROM THE DISTANCE FOLLOWED SHORTLY BY THE RATTLE
OF WHEELS AND THE CLINK OF HORSES' HOOFS
NOW WATSON SAID HOLMES AS A TALL DOG CART DASHED UP THROUGH
THE GLOOM THROWING OUT TWO GOLDEN TUNNELS OF YELLOW LIGHT FROM
ITS SIDE LANTERNS
YOU'LL COME WITH ME WON'T YOU
IF I CAN BE OF USE
OH A TRUSTY COMRADE IS ALWAYS OF USE AND A CHRONICLER STILL
MORE SO
MY ROOM AT THE CEDARS IS A DOUBLE BEDDED ONE
THE CEDARS
YES THAT IS MR
ST
CLAIR'S HOUSE
I AM STAYING THERE WHILE I
CONDUCT THE INQUIRY
WHERE IS IT THEN
NEAR LEE IN KENT
WE HAVE A SEVEN MILE DRIVE BEFORE US
BUT I AM ALL IN THE DARK
OF COURSE YOU ARE
YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT IT PRESENTLY
JUMP UP
HERE
ALL RIGHT JOHN WE SHALL NOT NEED YOU
HERE'S HALF A
CROWN
LOOK OUT FOR ME TO MORROW ABOUT ELEVEN
GIVE HER HER
HEAD
SO LONG THEN
HE FLICKED THE HORSE WITH HIS WHIP AND WE DASHED AWAY THROUGH
THE ENDLESS SUCCESSION OF SOMBRE AND DESERTED STREETS WHICH
WIDENED GRADUALLY UNTIL WE WERE FLYING ACROSS A BROAD
BALUSTRADED BRIDGE WITH THE MURKY RIVER FLOWING SLUGGISHLY
BENEATH US
BEYOND LAY ANOTHER DULL WILDERNESS OF BRICKS AND
MORTAR ITS SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE HEAVY REGULAR FOOTFALL OF
THE POLICEMAN OR THE SONGS AND SHOUTS OF SOME BELATED PARTY OF
REVELLERS
A DULL WRACK WAS DRIFTING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AND A
STAR OR TWO TWINKLED DIMLY HERE AND THERE THROUGH THE RIFTS OF
THE CLOUDS
HOLMES DROVE IN SILENCE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS
BREAST AND THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS LOST IN THOUGHT WHILE I SAT
BESIDE HIM CURIOUS TO LEARN WHAT THIS NEW QUEST MIGHT BE WHICH
SEEMED TO TAX HIS POWERS SO SORELY AND YET AFRAID TO BREAK IN
UPON THE CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS
WE HAD DRIVEN SEVERAL MILES
AND WERE BEGINNING TO GET TO THE FRINGE OF THE BELT OF SUBURBAN
VILLAS WHEN HE SHOOK HIMSELF SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND LIT UP
HIS PIPE WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO HAS SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT HE
IS ACTING FOR THE BEST
YOU HAVE A GRAND GIFT OF SILENCE WATSON SAID HE
IT MAKES
YOU QUITE INVALUABLE AS A COMPANION
'PON MY WORD IT IS A GREAT
THING FOR ME TO HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO FOR MY OWN THOUGHTS ARE
NOT OVER PLEASANT
I WAS WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD SAY TO THIS DEAR
LITTLE WOMAN TO NIGHT WHEN SHE MEETS ME AT THE DOOR
YOU FORGET THAT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT
I SHALL JUST HAVE TIME TO TELL YOU THE FACTS OF THE CASE BEFORE
WE GET TO LEE
IT SEEMS ABSURDLY SIMPLE AND YET SOMEHOW I CAN
GET NOTHING TO GO UPON
THERE'S PLENTY OF THREAD NO DOUBT BUT I
CAN'T GET THE END OF IT INTO MY HAND
NOW I'LL STATE THE CASE
CLEARLY AND CONCISELY TO YOU WATSON AND MAYBE YOU CAN SEE A
SPARK WHERE ALL IS DARK TO ME
PROCEED THEN
SOME YEARS AGO TO BE DEFINITE IN MAY 1884 THERE CAME TO LEE
A GENTLEMAN NEVILLE ST
CLAIR BY NAME WHO APPEARED TO HAVE
PLENTY OF MONEY
HE TOOK A LARGE VILLA LAID OUT THE GROUNDS VERY
NICELY AND LIVED GENERALLY IN GOOD STYLE
BY DEGREES HE MADE
FRIENDS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND IN 1887 HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER
OF A LOCAL BREWER BY WHOM HE NOW HAS TWO CHILDREN
HE HAD NO
OCCUPATION BUT WAS INTERESTED IN SEVERAL COMPANIES AND WENT INTO
TOWN AS A RULE IN THE MORNING RETURNING BY THE 5 14 FROM CANNON
STREET EVERY NIGHT
MR
ST
CLAIR IS NOW THIRTY SEVEN YEARS OF
AGE IS A MAN OF TEMPERATE HABITS A GOOD HUSBAND A VERY
AFFECTIONATE FATHER AND A MAN WHO IS POPULAR WITH ALL WHO KNOW
HIM
I MAY ADD THAT HIS WHOLE DEBTS AT THE PRESENT MOMENT AS FAR
AS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN AMOUNT TO 88 POUNDS 10S WHILE
HE HAS 220 POUNDS STANDING TO HIS CREDIT IN THE CAPITAL AND
COUNTIES BANK
THERE IS NO REASON THEREFORE TO THINK THAT MONEY
TROUBLES HAVE BEEN WEIGHING UPON HIS MIND
LAST MONDAY MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR WENT INTO TOWN RATHER EARLIER
THAN USUAL REMARKING BEFORE HE STARTED THAT HE HAD TWO IMPORTANT
COMMISSIONS TO PERFORM AND THAT HE WOULD BRING HIS LITTLE BOY
HOME A BOX OF BRICKS
NOW BY THE MEREST CHANCE HIS WIFE
RECEIVED A TELEGRAM UPON THIS SAME MONDAY VERY SHORTLY AFTER HIS
DEPARTURE TO THE EFFECT THAT A SMALL PARCEL OF CONSIDERABLE
VALUE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING WAS WAITING FOR HER AT THE
OFFICES OF THE ABERDEEN SHIPPING COMPANY
NOW IF YOU ARE WELL UP
IN YOUR LONDON YOU WILL KNOW THAT THE OFFICE OF THE COMPANY IS
IN FRESNO STREET WHICH BRANCHES OUT OF UPPER SWANDAM LANE WHERE
YOU FOUND ME TO NIGHT
MRS
ST
CLAIR HAD HER LUNCH STARTED FOR
THE CITY DID SOME SHOPPING PROCEEDED TO THE COMPANY'S OFFICE
GOT HER PACKET AND FOUND HERSELF AT EXACTLY 4 35 WALKING THROUGH
SWANDAM LANE ON HER WAY BACK TO THE STATION
HAVE YOU FOLLOWED ME
SO FAR
IT IS VERY CLEAR
IF YOU REMEMBER MONDAY WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY HOT DAY AND MRS
ST
CLAIR WALKED SLOWLY GLANCING ABOUT IN THE HOPE OF SEEING A CAB
AS SHE DID NOT LIKE THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IN WHICH SHE FOUND HERSELF
WHILE SHE WAS WALKING IN THIS WAY DOWN SWANDAM LANE SHE SUDDENLY
HEARD AN EJACULATION OR CRY AND WAS STRUCK COLD TO SEE HER
HUSBAND LOOKING DOWN AT HER AND AS IT SEEMED TO HER BECKONING
TO HER FROM A SECOND FLOOR WINDOW
THE WINDOW WAS OPEN AND SHE
DISTINCTLY SAW HIS FACE WHICH SHE DESCRIBES AS BEING TERRIBLY
AGITATED
HE WAVED HIS HANDS FRANTICALLY TO HER AND THEN
VANISHED FROM THE WINDOW SO SUDDENLY THAT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT
HE HAD BEEN PLUCKED BACK BY SOME IRRESISTIBLE FORCE FROM BEHIND
ONE SINGULAR POINT WHICH STRUCK HER QUICK FEMININE EYE WAS THAT
ALTHOUGH HE WORE SOME DARK COAT SUCH AS HE HAD STARTED TO TOWN
IN HE HAD ON NEITHER COLLAR NOR NECKTIE
CONVINCED THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS WITH HIM SHE RUSHED DOWN THE
STEPS FOR THE HOUSE WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE OPIUM DEN IN WHICH
YOU FOUND ME TO NIGHT AND RUNNING THROUGH THE FRONT ROOM SHE
ATTEMPTED TO ASCEND THE STAIRS WHICH LED TO THE FIRST FLOOR
AT
THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS HOWEVER SHE MET THIS LASCAR SCOUNDREL OF
WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN WHO THRUST HER BACK AND AIDED BY A DANE WHO
ACTS AS ASSISTANT THERE PUSHED HER OUT INTO THE STREET
FILLED
WITH THE MOST MADDENING DOUBTS AND FEARS SHE RUSHED DOWN THE
LANE AND BY RARE GOOD FORTUNE MET IN FRESNO STREET A NUMBER OF
CONSTABLES WITH AN INSPECTOR ALL ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR BEAT
THE
INSPECTOR AND TWO MEN ACCOMPANIED HER BACK AND IN SPITE OF THE
CONTINUED RESISTANCE OF THE PROPRIETOR THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO
THE ROOM IN WHICH MR
ST
CLAIR HAD LAST BEEN SEEN
THERE WAS NO
SIGN OF HIM THERE
IN FACT IN THE WHOLE OF THAT FLOOR THERE WAS
NO ONE TO BE FOUND SAVE A CRIPPLED WRETCH OF HIDEOUS ASPECT WHO
IT SEEMS MADE HIS HOME THERE
BOTH HE AND THE LASCAR STOUTLY
SWORE THAT NO ONE ELSE HAD BEEN IN THE FRONT ROOM DURING THE
AFTERNOON
SO DETERMINED WAS THEIR DENIAL THAT THE INSPECTOR WAS
STAGGERED AND HAD ALMOST COME TO BELIEVE THAT MRS
ST
CLAIR HAD
BEEN DELUDED WHEN WITH A CRY SHE SPRANG AT A SMALL DEAL BOX
WHICH LAY UPON THE TABLE AND TORE THE LID FROM IT
OUT THERE FELL
A CASCADE OF CHILDREN'S BRICKS
IT WAS THE TOY WHICH HE HAD
PROMISED TO BRING HOME
THIS DISCOVERY AND THE EVIDENT CONFUSION WHICH THE CRIPPLE
SHOWED MADE THE INSPECTOR REALISE THAT THE MATTER WAS SERIOUS
THE ROOMS WERE CAREFULLY EXAMINED AND RESULTS ALL POINTED TO AN
ABOMINABLE CRIME
THE FRONT ROOM WAS PLAINLY FURNISHED AS A
SITTING ROOM AND LED INTO A SMALL BEDROOM WHICH LOOKED OUT UPON
THE BACK OF ONE OF THE WHARVES
BETWEEN THE WHARF AND THE BEDROOM
WINDOW IS A NARROW STRIP WHICH IS DRY AT LOW TIDE BUT IS COVERED
AT HIGH TIDE WITH AT LEAST FOUR AND A HALF FEET OF WATER
THE
BEDROOM WINDOW WAS A BROAD ONE AND OPENED FROM BELOW
ON
EXAMINATION TRACES OF BLOOD WERE TO BE SEEN UPON THE WINDOWSILL
AND SEVERAL SCATTERED DROPS WERE VISIBLE UPON THE WOODEN FLOOR OF
THE BEDROOM
THRUST AWAY BEHIND A CURTAIN IN THE FRONT ROOM WERE
ALL THE CLOTHES OF MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
HIS COAT
HIS BOOTS HIS SOCKS HIS HAT AND HIS WATCH ALL WERE
THERE
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF VIOLENCE UPON ANY OF THESE
GARMENTS AND THERE WERE NO OTHER TRACES OF MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR
OUT OF THE WINDOW HE MUST APPARENTLY HAVE GONE FOR NO
OTHER EXIT COULD BE DISCOVERED AND THE OMINOUS BLOODSTAINS UPON
THE SILL GAVE LITTLE PROMISE THAT HE COULD SAVE HIMSELF BY
SWIMMING FOR THE TIDE WAS AT ITS VERY HIGHEST AT THE MOMENT OF
THE TRAGEDY
AND NOW AS TO THE VILLAINS WHO SEEMED TO BE IMMEDIATELY
IMPLICATED IN THE MATTER
THE LASCAR WAS KNOWN TO BE A MAN OF THE
VILEST ANTECEDENTS BUT AS BY MRS
ST
CLAIR'S STORY HE WAS
KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIR WITHIN A VERY FEW
SECONDS OF HER HUSBAND'S APPEARANCE AT THE WINDOW HE COULD
HARDLY HAVE BEEN MORE THAN AN ACCESSORY TO THE CRIME
HIS DEFENCE
WAS ONE OF ABSOLUTE IGNORANCE AND HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD NO
KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE DOINGS OF HUGH BOONE HIS LODGER AND THAT HE
COULD NOT ACCOUNT IN ANY WAY FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE MISSING
GENTLEMAN'S CLOTHES
SO MUCH FOR THE LASCAR MANAGER
NOW FOR THE SINISTER CRIPPLE WHO
LIVES UPON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE OPIUM DEN AND WHO WAS
CERTAINLY THE LAST HUMAN BEING WHOSE EYES RESTED UPON NEVILLE ST
CLAIR
HIS NAME IS HUGH BOONE AND HIS HIDEOUS FACE IS ONE WHICH
IS FAMILIAR TO EVERY MAN WHO GOES MUCH TO THE CITY
HE IS A
PROFESSIONAL BEGGAR THOUGH IN ORDER TO AVOID THE POLICE
REGULATIONS HE PRETENDS TO A SMALL TRADE IN WAX VESTAS
SOME
LITTLE DISTANCE DOWN THREADNEEDLE STREET UPON THE LEFT HAND
SIDE THERE IS AS YOU MAY HAVE REMARKED A SMALL ANGLE IN THE
WALL
HERE IT IS THAT THIS CREATURE TAKES HIS DAILY SEAT
CROSS LEGGED WITH HIS TINY STOCK OF MATCHES ON HIS LAP AND AS HE
IS A PITEOUS SPECTACLE A SMALL RAIN OF CHARITY DESCENDS INTO THE
GREASY LEATHER CAP WHICH LIES UPON THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM
I
HAVE WATCHED THE FELLOW MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE EVER I THOUGHT OF
MAKING HIS PROFESSIONAL ACQUAINTANCE AND I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED
AT THE HARVEST WHICH HE HAS REAPED IN A SHORT TIME
HIS
APPEARANCE YOU SEE IS SO REMARKABLE THAT NO ONE CAN PASS HIM
WITHOUT OBSERVING HIM
A SHOCK OF ORANGE HAIR A PALE FACE
DISFIGURED BY A HORRIBLE SCAR WHICH BY ITS CONTRACTION HAS
TURNED UP THE OUTER EDGE OF HIS UPPER LIP A BULLDOG CHIN AND A
PAIR OF VERY PENETRATING DARK EYES WHICH PRESENT A SINGULAR
CONTRAST TO THE COLOUR OF HIS HAIR ALL MARK HIM OUT FROM AMID
THE COMMON CROWD OF MENDICANTS AND SO TOO DOES HIS WIT FOR HE
IS EVER READY WITH A REPLY TO ANY PIECE OF CHAFF WHICH MAY BE
THROWN AT HIM BY THE PASSERS BY
THIS IS THE MAN WHOM WE NOW
LEARN TO HAVE BEEN THE LODGER AT THE OPIUM DEN AND TO HAVE BEEN
THE LAST MAN TO SEE THE GENTLEMAN OF WHOM WE ARE IN QUEST
BUT A CRIPPLE SAID I
WHAT COULD HE HAVE DONE SINGLE HANDED
AGAINST A MAN IN THE PRIME OF LIFE
HE IS A CRIPPLE IN THE SENSE THAT HE WALKS WITH A LIMP BUT IN
OTHER RESPECTS HE APPEARS TO BE A POWERFUL AND WELL NURTURED MAN
SURELY YOUR MEDICAL EXPERIENCE WOULD TELL YOU WATSON THAT
WEAKNESS IN ONE LIMB IS OFTEN COMPENSATED FOR BY EXCEPTIONAL
STRENGTH IN THE OTHERS
PRAY CONTINUE YOUR NARRATIVE
MRS
ST
CLAIR HAD FAINTED AT THE SIGHT OF THE BLOOD UPON THE
WINDOW AND SHE WAS ESCORTED HOME IN A CAB BY THE POLICE AS HER
PRESENCE COULD BE OF NO HELP TO THEM IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
INSPECTOR BARTON WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE CASE MADE A VERY CAREFUL
EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES BUT WITHOUT FINDING ANYTHING WHICH
THREW ANY LIGHT UPON THE MATTER
ONE MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE IN NOT
ARRESTING BOONE INSTANTLY AS HE WAS ALLOWED SOME FEW MINUTES
DURING WHICH HE MIGHT HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH HIS FRIEND THE
LASCAR BUT THIS FAULT WAS SOON REMEDIED AND HE WAS SEIZED AND
SEARCHED WITHOUT ANYTHING BEING FOUND WHICH COULD INCRIMINATE
HIM
THERE WERE IT IS TRUE SOME BLOOD STAINS UPON HIS RIGHT
SHIRT SLEEVE BUT HE POINTED TO HIS RING FINGER WHICH HAD BEEN
CUT NEAR THE NAIL AND EXPLAINED THAT THE BLEEDING CAME FROM
THERE ADDING THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE WINDOW NOT LONG BEFORE AND
THAT THE STAINS WHICH HAD BEEN OBSERVED THERE CAME DOUBTLESS FROM
THE SAME SOURCE
HE DENIED STRENUOUSLY HAVING EVER SEEN MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR AND SWORE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE CLOTHES IN
HIS ROOM WAS AS MUCH A MYSTERY TO HIM AS TO THE POLICE
AS TO
MRS
ST
CLAIR'S ASSERTION THAT SHE HAD ACTUALLY SEEN HER HUSBAND
AT THE WINDOW HE DECLARED THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN EITHER MAD OR
DREAMING
HE WAS REMOVED LOUDLY PROTESTING TO THE
POLICE STATION WHILE THE INSPECTOR REMAINED UPON THE PREMISES IN
THE HOPE THAT THE EBBING TIDE MIGHT AFFORD SOME FRESH CLUE
AND IT DID THOUGH THEY HARDLY FOUND UPON THE MUD BANK WHAT THEY
HAD FEARED TO FIND
IT WAS NEVILLE ST
CLAIR'S COAT AND NOT
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR WHICH LAY UNCOVERED AS THE TIDE RECEDED
AND
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY FOUND IN THE POCKETS
I CANNOT IMAGINE
NO I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD GUESS
EVERY POCKET STUFFED WITH
PENNIES AND HALF PENNIES 421 PENNIES AND 270 HALF PENNIES
IT
WAS NO WONDER THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AWAY BY THE TIDE
BUT A
HUMAN BODY IS A DIFFERENT MATTER
THERE IS A FIERCE EDDY BETWEEN
THE WHARF AND THE HOUSE
IT SEEMED LIKELY ENOUGH THAT THE
WEIGHTED COAT HAD REMAINED WHEN THE STRIPPED BODY HAD BEEN SUCKED
AWAY INTO THE RIVER
BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THE OTHER CLOTHES WERE FOUND IN THE
ROOM
WOULD THE BODY BE DRESSED IN A COAT ALONE
NO SIR BUT THE FACTS MIGHT BE MET SPECIOUSLY ENOUGH
SUPPOSE
THAT THIS MAN BOONE HAD THRUST NEVILLE ST
CLAIR THROUGH THE
WINDOW THERE IS NO HUMAN EYE WHICH COULD HAVE SEEN THE DEED
WHAT WOULD HE DO THEN IT WOULD OF COURSE INSTANTLY STRIKE HIM
THAT HE MUST GET RID OF THE TELL TALE GARMENTS
HE WOULD SEIZE
THE COAT THEN AND BE IN THE ACT OF THROWING IT OUT WHEN IT
WOULD OCCUR TO HIM THAT IT WOULD SWIM AND NOT SINK
HE HAS LITTLE
TIME FOR HE HAS HEARD THE SCUFFLE DOWNSTAIRS WHEN THE WIFE TRIED
TO FORCE HER WAY UP AND PERHAPS HE HAS ALREADY HEARD FROM HIS
LASCAR CONFEDERATE THAT THE POLICE ARE HURRYING UP THE STREET
THERE IS NOT AN INSTANT TO BE LOST
HE RUSHES TO SOME SECRET
HOARD WHERE HE HAS ACCUMULATED THE FRUITS OF HIS BEGGARY AND HE
STUFFS ALL THE COINS UPON WHICH HE CAN LAY HIS HANDS INTO THE
POCKETS TO MAKE SURE OF THE COAT'S SINKING
HE THROWS IT OUT AND
WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME WITH THE OTHER GARMENTS HAD NOT HE HEARD
THE RUSH OF STEPS BELOW AND ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO CLOSE THE
WINDOW WHEN THE POLICE APPEARED
IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS FEASIBLE
WELL WE WILL TAKE IT AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS FOR WANT OF A
BETTER
BOONE AS I HAVE TOLD YOU WAS ARRESTED AND TAKEN TO THE
STATION BUT IT COULD NOT BE SHOWN THAT THERE HAD EVER BEFORE
BEEN ANYTHING AGAINST HIM
HE HAD FOR YEARS BEEN KNOWN AS A
PROFESSIONAL BEGGAR BUT HIS LIFE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN A VERY
QUIET AND INNOCENT ONE
THERE THE MATTER STANDS AT PRESENT AND
THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAVE TO BE SOLVED WHAT NEVILLE ST
CLAIR WAS
DOING IN THE OPIUM DEN WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM WHEN THERE WHERE IS
HE NOW AND WHAT HUGH BOONE HAD TO DO WITH HIS DISAPPEARANCE ARE
ALL AS FAR FROM A SOLUTION AS EVER
I CONFESS THAT I CANNOT
RECALL ANY CASE WITHIN MY EXPERIENCE WHICH LOOKED AT THE FIRST
GLANCE SO SIMPLE AND YET WHICH PRESENTED SUCH DIFFICULTIES
WHILE SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN DETAILING THIS SINGULAR SERIES OF
EVENTS WE HAD BEEN WHIRLING THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GREAT
TOWN UNTIL THE LAST STRAGGLING HOUSES HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND
WE RATTLED ALONG WITH A COUNTRY HEDGE UPON EITHER SIDE OF US
JUST AS HE FINISHED HOWEVER WE DROVE THROUGH TWO SCATTERED
VILLAGES WHERE A FEW LIGHTS STILL GLIMMERED IN THE WINDOWS
WE ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF LEE SAID MY COMPANION
WE HAVE
TOUCHED ON THREE ENGLISH COUNTIES IN OUR SHORT DRIVE STARTING IN
MIDDLESEX PASSING OVER AN ANGLE OF SURREY AND ENDING IN KENT
SEE THAT LIGHT AMONG THE TREES THAT IS THE CEDARS AND BESIDE
THAT LAMP SITS A WOMAN WHOSE ANXIOUS EARS HAVE ALREADY I HAVE
LITTLE DOUBT CAUGHT THE CLINK OF OUR HORSE'S FEET
BUT WHY ARE YOU NOT CONDUCTING THE CASE FROM BAKER STREET I
ASKED
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INQUIRIES WHICH MUST BE MADE OUT HERE
MRS
ST
CLAIR HAS MOST KINDLY PUT TWO ROOMS AT MY DISPOSAL AND
YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT SHE WILL HAVE NOTHING BUT A WELCOME FOR
MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE
I HATE TO MEET HER WATSON WHEN I HAVE
NO NEWS OF HER HUSBAND
HERE WE ARE
WHOA THERE WHOA
WE HAD PULLED UP IN FRONT OF A LARGE VILLA WHICH STOOD WITHIN ITS
OWN GROUNDS
A STABLE BOY HAD RUN OUT TO THE HORSE'S HEAD AND
SPRINGING DOWN I FOLLOWED HOLMES UP THE SMALL WINDING
GRAVEL DRIVE WHICH LED TO THE HOUSE
AS WE APPROACHED THE DOOR
FLEW OPEN AND A LITTLE BLONDE WOMAN STOOD IN THE OPENING CLAD
IN SOME SORT OF LIGHT MOUSSELINE DE SOIE WITH A TOUCH OF FLUFFY
PINK CHIFFON AT HER NECK AND WRISTS
SHE STOOD WITH HER FIGURE
OUTLINED AGAINST THE FLOOD OF LIGHT ONE HAND UPON THE DOOR ONE
HALF RAISED IN HER EAGERNESS HER BODY SLIGHTLY BENT HER HEAD
AND FACE PROTRUDED WITH EAGER EYES AND PARTED LIPS A STANDING
QUESTION
WELL SHE CRIED WELL AND THEN SEEING THAT THERE WERE TWO
OF US SHE GAVE A CRY OF HOPE WHICH SANK INTO A GROAN AS SHE SAW
THAT MY COMPANION SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
NO GOOD NEWS
NONE
NO BAD
NO
THANK GOD FOR THAT
BUT COME IN
YOU MUST BE WEARY FOR YOU HAVE
HAD A LONG DAY
THIS IS MY FRIEND DR
WATSON
HE HAS BEEN OF MOST VITAL USE TO
ME IN SEVERAL OF MY CASES AND A LUCKY CHANCE HAS MADE IT
POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BRING HIM OUT AND ASSOCIATE HIM WITH THIS
INVESTIGATION
I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU SAID SHE PRESSING MY HAND WARMLY
YOU WILL I AM SURE FORGIVE ANYTHING THAT MAY BE WANTING IN OUR
ARRANGEMENTS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE BLOW WHICH HAS COME SO
SUDDENLY UPON US
MY DEAR MADAM SAID I I AM AN OLD CAMPAIGNER AND IF I WERE
NOT I CAN VERY WELL SEE THAT NO APOLOGY IS NEEDED
IF I CAN BE OF
ANY ASSISTANCE EITHER TO YOU OR TO MY FRIEND HERE I SHALL BE
INDEED HAPPY
NOW MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID THE LADY AS WE ENTERED A
WELL LIT DINING ROOM UPON THE TABLE OF WHICH A COLD SUPPER HAD
BEEN LAID OUT I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO ASK YOU ONE OR TWO
PLAIN QUESTIONS TO WHICH I BEG THAT YOU WILL GIVE A PLAIN
ANSWER
CERTAINLY MADAM
DO NOT TROUBLE ABOUT MY FEELINGS
I AM NOT HYSTERICAL NOR GIVEN
TO FAINTING
I SIMPLY WISH TO HEAR YOUR REAL REAL OPINION
UPON WHAT POINT
IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS DO YOU THINK THAT NEVILLE IS ALIVE
SHERLOCK HOLMES SEEMED TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THE QUESTION
FRANKLY NOW SHE REPEATED STANDING UPON THE RUG AND LOOKING
KEENLY DOWN AT HIM AS HE LEANED BACK IN A BASKET CHAIR
FRANKLY THEN MADAM I DO NOT
YOU THINK THAT HE IS DEAD
I DO
MURDERED
I DON'T SAY THAT
PERHAPS
AND ON WHAT DAY DID HE MEET HIS DEATH
ON MONDAY
THEN PERHAPS MR
HOLMES YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN HOW
IT IS THAT I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM TO DAY
SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR AS IF HE HAD BEEN
GALVANISED
WHAT HE ROARED
YES TO DAY SHE STOOD SMILING HOLDING UP A LITTLE SLIP OF
PAPER IN THE AIR
MAY I SEE IT
CERTAINLY
HE SNATCHED IT FROM HER IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SMOOTHING IT OUT
UPON THE TABLE HE DREW OVER THE LAMP AND EXAMINED IT INTENTLY
I
HAD LEFT MY CHAIR AND WAS GAZING AT IT OVER HIS SHOULDER
THE
ENVELOPE WAS A VERY COARSE ONE AND WAS STAMPED WITH THE GRAVESEND
POSTMARK AND WITH THE DATE OF THAT VERY DAY OR RATHER OF THE DAY
BEFORE FOR IT WAS CONSIDERABLY AFTER MIDNIGHT
COARSE WRITING MURMURED HOLMES
SURELY THIS IS NOT YOUR
HUSBAND'S WRITING MADAM
NO BUT THE ENCLOSURE IS
I PERCEIVE ALSO THAT WHOEVER ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE HAD TO GO
AND INQUIRE AS TO THE ADDRESS
HOW CAN YOU TELL THAT
THE NAME YOU SEE IS IN PERFECTLY BLACK INK WHICH HAS DRIED
ITSELF
THE REST IS OF THE GREYISH COLOUR WHICH SHOWS THAT
BLOTTING PAPER HAS BEEN USED
IF IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN STRAIGHT
OFF AND THEN BLOTTED NONE WOULD BE OF A DEEP BLACK SHADE
THIS
MAN HAS WRITTEN THE NAME AND THERE HAS THEN BEEN A PAUSE BEFORE
HE WROTE THE ADDRESS WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN THAT HE WAS NOT
FAMILIAR WITH IT
IT IS OF COURSE A TRIFLE BUT THERE IS
NOTHING SO IMPORTANT AS TRIFLES
LET US NOW SEE THE LETTER
HA
THERE HAS BEEN AN ENCLOSURE HERE
YES THERE WAS A RING
HIS SIGNET RING
AND YOU ARE SURE THAT THIS IS YOUR HUSBAND'S HAND
ONE OF HIS HANDS
ONE
HIS HAND WHEN HE WROTE HURRIEDLY
IT IS VERY UNLIKE HIS USUAL
WRITING AND YET I KNOW IT WELL
'DEAREST DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED
ALL WILL COME WELL
THERE IS A
HUGE ERROR WHICH IT MAY TAKE SOME LITTLE TIME TO RECTIFY
WAIT IN PATIENCE NEVILLE WRITTEN IN PENCIL UPON THE FLY LEAF
OF A BOOK OCTAVO SIZE NO WATER MARK
HUM POSTED TO DAY IN
GRAVESEND BY A MAN WITH A DIRTY THUMB
HA AND THE FLAP HAS BEEN
GUMMED IF I AM NOT VERY MUCH IN ERROR BY A PERSON WHO HAD BEEN
CHEWING TOBACCO
AND YOU HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S
HAND MADAM
NONE
NEVILLE WROTE THOSE WORDS
AND THEY WERE POSTED TO DAY AT GRAVESEND
WELL MRS
ST
CLAIR
THE CLOUDS LIGHTEN THOUGH I SHOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE
DANGER IS OVER
BUT HE MUST BE ALIVE MR
HOLMES
UNLESS THIS IS A CLEVER FORGERY TO PUT US ON THE WRONG SCENT
THE RING AFTER ALL PROVES NOTHING
IT MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM
HIM
NO NO IT IS IT IS HIS VERY OWN WRITING
VERY WELL
IT MAY HOWEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON MONDAY AND ONLY
POSTED TO DAY
THAT IS POSSIBLE
IF SO MUCH MAY HAVE HAPPENED BETWEEN
OH YOU MUST NOT DISCOURAGE ME MR
HOLMES
I KNOW THAT ALL IS
WELL WITH HIM
THERE IS SO KEEN A SYMPATHY BETWEEN US THAT I
SHOULD KNOW IF EVIL CAME UPON HIM
ON THE VERY DAY THAT I SAW HIM
LAST HE CUT HIMSELF IN THE BEDROOM AND YET I IN THE DINING ROOM
RUSHED UPSTAIRS INSTANTLY WITH THE UTMOST CERTAINTY THAT
SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED
DO YOU THINK THAT I WOULD RESPOND TO SUCH
A TRIFLE AND YET BE IGNORANT OF HIS DEATH
I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH NOT TO KNOW THAT THE IMPRESSION OF A WOMAN
MAY BE MORE VALUABLE THAN THE CONCLUSION OF AN ANALYTICAL
REASONER
AND IN THIS LETTER YOU CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY STRONG
PIECE OF EVIDENCE TO CORROBORATE YOUR VIEW
BUT IF YOUR HUSBAND
IS ALIVE AND ABLE TO WRITE LETTERS WHY SHOULD HE REMAIN AWAY
FROM YOU
I CANNOT IMAGINE
IT IS UNTHINKABLE
AND ON MONDAY HE MADE NO REMARKS BEFORE LEAVING YOU
NO
AND YOU WERE SURPRISED TO SEE HIM IN SWANDAM LANE
VERY MUCH SO
WAS THE WINDOW OPEN
YES
THEN HE MIGHT HAVE CALLED TO YOU
HE MIGHT
HE ONLY AS I UNDERSTAND GAVE AN INARTICULATE CRY
YES
A CALL FOR HELP YOU THOUGHT
YES
HE WAVED HIS HANDS
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CRY OF SURPRISE
ASTONISHMENT AT THE
UNEXPECTED SIGHT OF YOU MIGHT CAUSE HIM TO THROW UP HIS HANDS
IT IS POSSIBLE
AND YOU THOUGHT HE WAS PULLED BACK
HE DISAPPEARED SO SUDDENLY
HE MIGHT HAVE LEAPED BACK
YOU DID NOT SEE ANYONE ELSE IN THE
ROOM
NO BUT THIS HORRIBLE MAN CONFESSED TO HAVING BEEN THERE AND
THE LASCAR WAS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
QUITE SO
YOUR HUSBAND AS FAR AS YOU COULD SEE HAD HIS
ORDINARY CLOTHES ON
BUT WITHOUT HIS COLLAR OR TIE
I DISTINCTLY SAW HIS BARE
THROAT
HAD HE EVER SPOKEN OF SWANDAM LANE
NEVER
HAD HE EVER SHOWED ANY SIGNS OF HAVING TAKEN OPIUM
NEVER
THANK YOU MRS
ST
CLAIR
THOSE ARE THE PRINCIPAL POINTS ABOUT
WHICH I WISHED TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
WE SHALL NOW HAVE A LITTLE
SUPPER AND THEN RETIRE FOR WE MAY HAVE A VERY BUSY DAY
TO MORROW
A LARGE AND COMFORTABLE DOUBLE BEDDED ROOM HAD BEEN PLACED AT OUR
DISPOSAL AND I WAS QUICKLY BETWEEN THE SHEETS FOR I WAS WEARY
AFTER MY NIGHT OF ADVENTURE
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A MAN HOWEVER
WHO WHEN HE HAD AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM UPON HIS MIND WOULD GO FOR
DAYS AND EVEN FOR A WEEK WITHOUT REST TURNING IT OVER
REARRANGING HIS FACTS LOOKING AT IT FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW
UNTIL HE HAD EITHER FATHOMED IT OR CONVINCED HIMSELF THAT HIS
DATA WERE INSUFFICIENT
IT WAS SOON EVIDENT TO ME THAT HE WAS NOW
PREPARING FOR AN ALL NIGHT SITTING
HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND
WAISTCOAT PUT ON A LARGE BLUE DRESSING GOWN AND THEN WANDERED
ABOUT THE ROOM COLLECTING PILLOWS FROM HIS BED AND CUSHIONS FROM
THE SOFA AND ARMCHAIRS
WITH THESE HE CONSTRUCTED A SORT OF
EASTERN DIVAN UPON WHICH HE PERCHED HIMSELF CROSS LEGGED WITH
AN OUNCE OF SHAG TOBACCO AND A BOX OF MATCHES LAID OUT IN FRONT
OF HIM
IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE LAMP I SAW HIM SITTING THERE AN
OLD BRIAR PIPE BETWEEN HIS LIPS HIS EYES FIXED VACANTLY UPON THE
CORNER OF THE CEILING THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UP FROM HIM
SILENT MOTIONLESS WITH THE LIGHT SHINING UPON HIS STRONG SET
AQUILINE FEATURES
SO HE SAT AS I DROPPED OFF TO SLEEP AND SO HE
SAT WHEN A SUDDEN EJACULATION CAUSED ME TO WAKE UP AND I FOUND
THE SUMMER SUN SHINING INTO THE APARTMENT
THE PIPE WAS STILL
BETWEEN HIS LIPS THE SMOKE STILL CURLED UPWARD AND THE ROOM WAS
FULL OF A DENSE TOBACCO HAZE BUT NOTHING REMAINED OF THE HEAP OF
SHAG WHICH I HAD SEEN UPON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
AWAKE WATSON HE ASKED
YES
GAME FOR A MORNING DRIVE
CERTAINLY
THEN DRESS
NO ONE IS STIRRING YET BUT I KNOW WHERE THE
STABLE BOY SLEEPS AND WE SHALL SOON HAVE THE TRAP OUT HE
CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AS HE SPOKE HIS EYES TWINKLED AND HE SEEMED
A DIFFERENT MAN TO THE SOMBRE THINKER OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
AS I DRESSED I GLANCED AT MY WATCH
IT WAS NO WONDER THAT NO ONE
WAS STIRRING
IT WAS TWENTY FIVE MINUTES PAST FOUR
I HAD HARDLY
FINISHED WHEN HOLMES RETURNED WITH THE NEWS THAT THE BOY WAS
PUTTING IN THE HORSE
I WANT TO TEST A LITTLE THEORY OF MINE SAID HE PULLING ON HIS
BOOTS
I THINK WATSON THAT YOU ARE NOW STANDING IN THE
PRESENCE OF ONE OF THE MOST ABSOLUTE FOOLS IN EUROPE
I DESERVE
TO BE KICKED FROM HERE TO CHARING CROSS
BUT I THINK I HAVE THE
KEY OF THE AFFAIR NOW
AND WHERE IS IT I ASKED SMILING
IN THE BATHROOM HE ANSWERED
OH YES I AM NOT JOKING HE
CONTINUED SEEING MY LOOK OF INCREDULITY
I HAVE JUST BEEN
THERE AND I HAVE TAKEN IT OUT AND I HAVE GOT IT IN THIS
GLADSTONE BAG
COME ON MY BOY AND WE SHALL SEE WHETHER IT WILL
NOT FIT THE LOCK
WE MADE OUR WAY DOWNSTAIRS AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE AND OUT INTO
THE BRIGHT MORNING SUNSHINE
IN THE ROAD STOOD OUR HORSE AND
TRAP WITH THE HALF CLAD STABLE BOY WAITING AT THE HEAD
WE BOTH
SPRANG IN AND AWAY WE DASHED DOWN THE LONDON ROAD
A FEW COUNTRY
CARTS WERE STIRRING BEARING IN VEGETABLES TO THE METROPOLIS BUT
THE LINES OF VILLAS ON EITHER SIDE WERE AS SILENT AND LIFELESS AS
SOME CITY IN A DREAM
IT HAS BEEN IN SOME POINTS A SINGULAR CASE SAID HOLMES
FLICKING THE HORSE ON INTO A GALLOP
I CONFESS THAT I HAVE BEEN
AS BLIND AS A MOLE BUT IT IS BETTER TO LEARN WISDOM LATE THAN
NEVER TO LEARN IT AT ALL
IN TOWN THE EARLIEST RISERS WERE JUST BEGINNING TO LOOK SLEEPILY
FROM THEIR WINDOWS AS WE DROVE THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE SURREY
SIDE
PASSING DOWN THE WATERLOO BRIDGE ROAD WE CROSSED OVER THE
RIVER AND DASHING UP WELLINGTON STREET WHEELED SHARPLY TO THE
RIGHT AND FOUND OURSELVES IN BOW STREET
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS WELL
KNOWN TO THE FORCE AND THE TWO CONSTABLES AT THE DOOR SALUTED
HIM
ONE OF THEM HELD THE HORSE'S HEAD WHILE THE OTHER LED US IN
WHO IS ON DUTY ASKED HOLMES
INSPECTOR BRADSTREET SIR
AH BRADSTREET HOW ARE YOU A TALL STOUT OFFICIAL HAD COME
DOWN THE STONE FLAGGED PASSAGE IN A PEAKED CAP AND FROGGED
JACKET
I WISH TO HAVE A QUIET WORD WITH YOU BRADSTREET
CERTAINLY MR
HOLMES
STEP INTO MY ROOM HERE IT WAS A SMALL
OFFICE LIKE ROOM WITH A HUGE LEDGER UPON THE TABLE AND A
TELEPHONE PROJECTING FROM THE WALL
THE INSPECTOR SAT DOWN AT HIS
DESK
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU MR
HOLMES
I CALLED ABOUT THAT BEGGARMAN BOONE THE ONE WHO WAS CHARGED
WITH BEING CONCERNED IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR OF LEE
YES
HE WAS BROUGHT UP AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER INQUIRIES
SO I HEARD
YOU HAVE HIM HERE
IN THE CELLS
IS HE QUIET
OH HE GIVES NO TROUBLE
BUT HE IS A DIRTY SCOUNDREL
DIRTY
YES IT IS ALL WE CAN DO TO MAKE HIM WASH HIS HANDS AND HIS
FACE IS AS BLACK AS A TINKER'S
WELL WHEN ONCE HIS CASE HAS BEEN
SETTLED HE WILL HAVE A REGULAR PRISON BATH AND I THINK IF YOU
SAW HIM YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT HE NEEDED IT
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM VERY MUCH
WOULD YOU THAT IS EASILY DONE
COME THIS WAY
YOU CAN LEAVE
YOUR BAG
NO I THINK THAT I'LL TAKE IT
VERY GOOD
COME THIS WAY IF YOU PLEASE HE LED US DOWN A
PASSAGE OPENED A BARRED DOOR PASSED DOWN A WINDING STAIR AND
BROUGHT US TO A WHITEWASHED CORRIDOR WITH A LINE OF DOORS ON EACH
SIDE
THE THIRD ON THE RIGHT IS HIS SAID THE INSPECTOR
HERE IT
IS HE QUIETLY SHOT BACK A PANEL IN THE UPPER PART OF THE DOOR
AND GLANCED THROUGH
HE IS ASLEEP SAID HE
YOU CAN SEE HIM VERY WELL
WE BOTH PUT OUR EYES TO THE GRATING
THE PRISONER LAY WITH HIS
FACE TOWARDS US IN A VERY DEEP SLEEP BREATHING SLOWLY AND
HEAVILY
HE WAS A MIDDLE SIZED MAN COARSELY CLAD AS BECAME HIS
CALLING WITH A COLOURED SHIRT PROTRUDING THROUGH THE RENT IN HIS
TATTERED COAT
HE WAS AS THE INSPECTOR HAD SAID EXTREMELY
DIRTY BUT THE GRIME WHICH COVERED HIS FACE COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS
REPULSIVE UGLINESS
A BROAD WHEAL FROM AN OLD SCAR RAN RIGHT
ACROSS IT FROM EYE TO CHIN AND BY ITS CONTRACTION HAD TURNED UP
ONE SIDE OF THE UPPER LIP SO THAT THREE TEETH WERE EXPOSED IN A
PERPETUAL SNARL
A SHOCK OF VERY BRIGHT RED HAIR GREW LOW OVER
HIS EYES AND FOREHEAD
HE'S A BEAUTY ISN'T HE SAID THE INSPECTOR
HE CERTAINLY NEEDS A WASH REMARKED HOLMES
I HAD AN IDEA THAT
HE MIGHT AND I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF BRINGING THE TOOLS WITH ME
HE OPENED THE GLADSTONE BAG AS HE SPOKE AND TOOK OUT TO MY
ASTONISHMENT A VERY LARGE BATH SPONGE
HE HE YOU ARE A FUNNY ONE CHUCKLED THE INSPECTOR
NOW IF YOU WILL HAVE THE GREAT GOODNESS TO OPEN THAT DOOR VERY
QUIETLY WE WILL SOON MAKE HIM CUT A MUCH MORE RESPECTABLE
FIGURE
WELL I DON'T KNOW WHY NOT SAID THE INSPECTOR
HE DOESN'T
LOOK A CREDIT TO THE BOW STREET CELLS DOES HE HE SLIPPED HIS
KEY INTO THE LOCK AND WE ALL VERY QUIETLY ENTERED THE CELL
THE
SLEEPER HALF TURNED AND THEN SETTLED DOWN ONCE MORE INTO A DEEP
SLUMBER
HOLMES STOOPED TO THE WATER JUG MOISTENED HIS SPONGE
AND THEN RUBBED IT TWICE VIGOROUSLY ACROSS AND DOWN THE
PRISONER'S FACE
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU HE SHOUTED TO MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR OF
LEE IN THE COUNTY OF KENT
NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN SUCH A SIGHT
THE MAN'S FACE PEELED
OFF UNDER THE SPONGE LIKE THE BARK FROM A TREE
GONE WAS THE
COARSE BROWN TINT GONE TOO WAS THE HORRID SCAR WHICH HAD
SEAMED IT ACROSS AND THE TWISTED LIP WHICH HAD GIVEN THE
REPULSIVE SNEER TO THE FACE A TWITCH BROUGHT AWAY THE TANGLED
RED HAIR AND THERE SITTING UP IN HIS BED WAS A PALE
SAD FACED REFINED LOOKING MAN BLACK HAIRED AND SMOOTH SKINNED
RUBBING HIS EYES AND STARING ABOUT HIM WITH SLEEPY BEWILDERMENT
THEN SUDDENLY REALISING THE EXPOSURE HE BROKE INTO A SCREAM AND
THREW HIMSELF DOWN WITH HIS FACE TO THE PILLOW
GREAT HEAVENS CRIED THE INSPECTOR IT IS INDEED THE MISSING
MAN
I KNOW HIM FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH
THE PRISONER TURNED WITH THE RECKLESS AIR OF A MAN WHO ABANDONS
HIMSELF TO HIS DESTINY
BE IT SO SAID HE
AND PRAY WHAT AM I
CHARGED WITH
WITH MAKING AWAY WITH MR
NEVILLE ST OH COME YOU CAN'T BE
CHARGED WITH THAT UNLESS THEY MAKE A CASE OF ATTEMPTED SUICIDE OF
IT SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH A GRIN
WELL I HAVE BEEN
TWENTY SEVEN YEARS IN THE FORCE BUT THIS REALLY TAKES THE CAKE
IF I AM MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR THEN IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO CRIME
HAS BEEN COMMITTED AND THAT THEREFORE I AM ILLEGALLY
DETAINED
NO CRIME BUT A VERY GREAT ERROR HAS BEEN COMMITTED SAID
HOLMES
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE TRUSTED YOUR WIFE
IT WAS NOT THE WIFE IT WAS THE CHILDREN GROANED THE PRISONER
GOD HELP ME I WOULD NOT HAVE THEM ASHAMED OF THEIR FATHER
MY
GOD WHAT AN EXPOSURE WHAT CAN I DO
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT DOWN BESIDE HIM ON THE COUCH AND PATTED HIM
KINDLY ON THE SHOULDER
IF YOU LEAVE IT TO A COURT OF LAW TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP SAID
HE OF COURSE YOU CAN HARDLY AVOID PUBLICITY
ON THE OTHER HAND
IF YOU CONVINCE THE POLICE AUTHORITIES THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE
CASE AGAINST YOU I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS ANY REASON THAT THE
DETAILS SHOULD FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE PAPERS
INSPECTOR
BRADSTREET WOULD I AM SURE MAKE NOTES UPON ANYTHING WHICH YOU
MIGHT TELL US AND SUBMIT IT TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES
THE CASE
WOULD THEN NEVER GO INTO COURT AT ALL
GOD BLESS YOU CRIED THE PRISONER PASSIONATELY
I WOULD HAVE
ENDURED IMPRISONMENT AY EVEN EXECUTION RATHER THAN HAVE LEFT
MY MISERABLE SECRET AS A FAMILY BLOT TO MY CHILDREN
YOU ARE THE FIRST WHO HAVE EVER HEARD MY STORY
MY FATHER WAS A
SCHOOLMASTER IN CHESTERFIELD WHERE I RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT
EDUCATION
I TRAVELLED IN MY YOUTH TOOK TO THE STAGE AND
FINALLY BECAME A REPORTER ON AN EVENING PAPER IN LONDON
ONE DAY
MY EDITOR WISHED TO HAVE A SERIES OF ARTICLES UPON BEGGING IN THE
METROPOLIS AND I VOLUNTEERED TO SUPPLY THEM
THERE WAS THE POINT
FROM WHICH ALL MY ADVENTURES STARTED
IT WAS ONLY BY TRYING
BEGGING AS AN AMATEUR THAT I COULD GET THE FACTS UPON WHICH TO
BASE MY ARTICLES
WHEN AN ACTOR I HAD OF COURSE LEARNED ALL THE
SECRETS OF MAKING UP AND HAD BEEN FAMOUS IN THE GREEN ROOM FOR
MY SKILL
I TOOK ADVANTAGE NOW OF MY ATTAINMENTS
I PAINTED MY
FACE AND TO MAKE MYSELF AS PITIABLE AS POSSIBLE I MADE A GOOD
SCAR AND FIXED ONE SIDE OF MY LIP IN A TWIST BY THE AID OF A
SMALL SLIP OF FLESH COLOURED PLASTER
THEN WITH A RED HEAD OF
HAIR AND AN APPROPRIATE DRESS I TOOK MY STATION IN THE BUSINESS
PART OF THE CITY OSTENSIBLY AS A MATCH SELLER BUT REALLY AS A
BEGGAR
FOR SEVEN HOURS I PLIED MY TRADE AND WHEN I RETURNED
HOME IN THE EVENING I FOUND TO MY SURPRISE THAT I HAD RECEIVED NO
LESS THAN 26S
4D
I WROTE MY ARTICLES AND THOUGHT LITTLE MORE OF THE MATTER UNTIL
SOME TIME LATER I BACKED A BILL FOR A FRIEND AND HAD A WRIT
SERVED UPON ME FOR 25 POUNDS
I WAS AT MY WIT'S END WHERE TO GET
THE MONEY BUT A SUDDEN IDEA CAME TO ME
I BEGGED A FORTNIGHT'S
GRACE FROM THE CREDITOR ASKED FOR A HOLIDAY FROM MY EMPLOYERS
AND SPENT THE TIME IN BEGGING IN THE CITY UNDER MY DISGUISE
IN
TEN DAYS I HAD THE MONEY AND HAD PAID THE DEBT
WELL YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD IT WAS TO SETTLE DOWN TO ARDUOUS
WORK AT 2 POUNDS A WEEK WHEN I KNEW THAT I COULD EARN AS MUCH IN
A DAY BY SMEARING MY FACE WITH A LITTLE PAINT LAYING MY CAP ON
THE GROUND AND SITTING STILL
IT WAS A LONG FIGHT BETWEEN MY
PRIDE AND THE MONEY BUT THE DOLLARS WON AT LAST AND I THREW UP
REPORTING AND SAT DAY AFTER DAY IN THE CORNER WHICH I HAD FIRST
CHOSEN INSPIRING PITY BY MY GHASTLY FACE AND FILLING MY POCKETS
WITH COPPERS
ONLY ONE MAN KNEW MY SECRET
HE WAS THE KEEPER OF A
LOW DEN IN WHICH I USED TO LODGE IN SWANDAM LANE WHERE I COULD
EVERY MORNING EMERGE AS A SQUALID BEGGAR AND IN THE EVENINGS
TRANSFORM MYSELF INTO A WELL DRESSED MAN ABOUT TOWN
THIS FELLOW
A LASCAR WAS WELL PAID BY ME FOR HIS ROOMS SO THAT I KNEW THAT
MY SECRET WAS SAFE IN HIS POSSESSION
WELL VERY SOON I FOUND THAT I WAS SAVING CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF
MONEY
I DO NOT MEAN THAT ANY BEGGAR IN THE STREETS OF LONDON
COULD EARN 700 POUNDS A YEAR WHICH IS LESS THAN MY AVERAGE
TAKINGS BUT I HAD EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGES IN MY POWER OF MAKING
UP AND ALSO IN A FACILITY OF REPARTEE WHICH IMPROVED BY
PRACTICE AND MADE ME QUITE A RECOGNISED CHARACTER IN THE CITY
ALL DAY A STREAM OF PENNIES VARIED BY SILVER POURED IN UPON ME
AND IT WAS A VERY BAD DAY IN WHICH I FAILED TO TAKE 2 POUNDS
AS I GREW RICHER I GREW MORE AMBITIOUS TOOK A HOUSE IN THE
COUNTRY AND EVENTUALLY MARRIED WITHOUT ANYONE HAVING A
SUSPICION AS TO MY REAL OCCUPATION
MY DEAR WIFE KNEW THAT I HAD
BUSINESS IN THE CITY
SHE LITTLE KNEW WHAT
LAST MONDAY I HAD FINISHED FOR THE DAY AND WAS DRESSING IN MY
ROOM ABOVE THE OPIUM DEN WHEN I LOOKED OUT OF MY WINDOW AND SAW
TO MY HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT THAT MY WIFE WAS STANDING IN THE
STREET WITH HER EYES FIXED FULL UPON ME
I GAVE A CRY OF
SURPRISE THREW UP MY ARMS TO COVER MY FACE AND RUSHING TO MY
CONFIDANT THE LASCAR ENTREATED HIM TO PREVENT ANYONE FROM
COMING UP TO ME
I HEARD HER VOICE DOWNSTAIRS BUT I KNEW THAT
SHE COULD NOT ASCEND
SWIFTLY I THREW OFF MY CLOTHES PULLED ON
THOSE OF A BEGGAR AND PUT ON MY PIGMENTS AND WIG
EVEN A WIFE'S
EYES COULD NOT PIERCE SO COMPLETE A DISGUISE
BUT THEN IT
OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SEARCH IN THE ROOM AND THAT
THE CLOTHES MIGHT BETRAY ME
I THREW OPEN THE WINDOW REOPENING
BY MY VIOLENCE A SMALL CUT WHICH I HAD INFLICTED UPON MYSELF IN
THE BEDROOM THAT MORNING
THEN I SEIZED MY COAT WHICH WAS
WEIGHTED BY THE COPPERS WHICH I HAD JUST TRANSFERRED TO IT FROM
THE LEATHER BAG IN WHICH I CARRIED MY TAKINGS
I HURLED IT OUT OF
THE WINDOW AND IT DISAPPEARED INTO THE THAMES
THE OTHER CLOTHES
WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED BUT AT THAT MOMENT THERE WAS A RUSH OF
CONSTABLES UP THE STAIR AND A FEW MINUTES AFTER I FOUND RATHER
I CONFESS TO MY RELIEF THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS MR
NEVILLE ST
CLAIR I WAS ARRESTED AS HIS MURDERER
I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE FOR ME TO EXPLAIN
I
WAS DETERMINED TO PRESERVE MY DISGUISE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND
HENCE MY PREFERENCE FOR A DIRTY FACE
KNOWING THAT MY WIFE WOULD
BE TERRIBLY ANXIOUS I SLIPPED OFF MY RING AND CONFIDED IT TO THE
LASCAR AT A MOMENT WHEN NO CONSTABLE WAS WATCHING ME TOGETHER
WITH A HURRIED SCRAWL TELLING HER THAT SHE HAD NO CAUSE TO
FEAR
THAT NOTE ONLY REACHED HER YESTERDAY SAID HOLMES
GOOD GOD WHAT A WEEK SHE MUST HAVE SPENT
THE POLICE HAVE WATCHED THIS LASCAR SAID INSPECTOR BRADSTREET
AND I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT HE MIGHT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO
POST A LETTER UNOBSERVED
PROBABLY HE HANDED IT TO SOME SAILOR
CUSTOMER OF HIS WHO FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT FOR SOME DAYS
THAT WAS IT SAID HOLMES NODDING APPROVINGLY I HAVE NO DOUBT
OF IT
BUT HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN PROSECUTED FOR BEGGING
MANY TIMES BUT WHAT WAS A FINE TO ME
IT MUST STOP HERE HOWEVER SAID BRADSTREET
IF THE POLICE ARE
TO HUSH THIS THING UP THERE MUST BE NO MORE OF HUGH BOONE
I HAVE SWORN IT BY THE MOST SOLEMN OATHS WHICH A MAN CAN TAKE
IN THAT CASE I THINK THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT NO FURTHER STEPS
MAY BE TAKEN
BUT IF YOU ARE FOUND AGAIN THEN ALL MUST COME OUT
I AM SURE MR
HOLMES THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU FOR
HAVING CLEARED THE MATTER UP
I WISH I KNEW HOW YOU REACH YOUR
RESULTS
I REACHED THIS ONE SAID MY FRIEND BY SITTING UPON FIVE
PILLOWS AND CONSUMING AN OUNCE OF SHAG
I THINK WATSON THAT IF
WE DRIVE TO BAKER STREET WE SHALL JUST BE IN TIME FOR BREAKFAST
VII
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
I HAD CALLED UPON MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES UPON THE SECOND
MORNING AFTER CHRISTMAS WITH THE INTENTION OF WISHING HIM THE
COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON
HE WAS LOUNGING UPON THE SOFA IN A
PURPLE DRESSING GOWN A PIPE RACK WITHIN HIS REACH UPON THE
RIGHT AND A PILE OF CRUMPLED MORNING PAPERS EVIDENTLY NEWLY
STUDIED NEAR AT HAND
BESIDE THE COUCH WAS A WOODEN CHAIR AND
ON THE ANGLE OF THE BACK HUNG A VERY SEEDY AND DISREPUTABLE
HARD FELT HAT MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND CRACKED IN SEVERAL
PLACES
A LENS AND A FORCEPS LYING UPON THE SEAT OF THE CHAIR
SUGGESTED THAT THE HAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED IN THIS MANNER FOR THE
PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION
YOU ARE ENGAGED SAID I PERHAPS I INTERRUPT YOU
NOT AT ALL
I AM GLAD TO HAVE A FRIEND WITH WHOM I CAN DISCUSS
MY RESULTS
THE MATTER IS A PERFECTLY TRIVIAL ONE HE JERKED HIS
THUMB IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OLD HAT BUT THERE ARE POINTS IN
CONNECTION WITH IT WHICH ARE NOT ENTIRELY DEVOID OF INTEREST AND
EVEN OF INSTRUCTION
I SEATED MYSELF IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND WARMED MY HANDS BEFORE HIS
CRACKLING FIRE FOR A SHARP FROST HAD SET IN AND THE WINDOWS
WERE THICK WITH THE ICE CRYSTALS
I SUPPOSE I REMARKED THAT
HOMELY AS IT LOOKS THIS THING HAS SOME DEADLY STORY LINKED ON TO
IT THAT IT IS THE CLUE WHICH WILL GUIDE YOU IN THE SOLUTION OF
SOME MYSTERY AND THE PUNISHMENT OF SOME CRIME
NO NO
NO CRIME SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHING
ONLY ONE OF
THOSE WHIMSICAL LITTLE INCIDENTS WHICH WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE
FOUR MILLION HUMAN BEINGS ALL JOSTLING EACH OTHER WITHIN THE
SPACE OF A FEW SQUARE MILES
AMID THE ACTION AND REACTION OF SO
DENSE A SWARM OF HUMANITY EVERY POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF EVENTS
MAY BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE AND MANY A LITTLE PROBLEM WILL BE
PRESENTED WHICH MAY BE STRIKING AND BIZARRE WITHOUT BEING
CRIMINAL
WE HAVE ALREADY HAD EXPERIENCE OF SUCH
SO MUCH SO I REMARKED THAT OF THE LAST SIX CASES WHICH I
HAVE ADDED TO MY NOTES THREE HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FREE OF ANY
LEGAL CRIME
PRECISELY
YOU ALLUDE TO MY ATTEMPT TO RECOVER THE IRENE ADLER
PAPERS TO THE SINGULAR CASE OF MISS MARY SUTHERLAND AND TO THE
ADVENTURE OF THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
WELL I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT THIS SMALL MATTER WILL FALL INTO THE SAME INNOCENT CATEGORY
YOU KNOW PETERSON THE COMMISSIONAIRE
YES
IT IS TO HIM THAT THIS TROPHY BELONGS
IT IS HIS HAT
NO NO HE FOUND IT
ITS OWNER IS UNKNOWN
I BEG THAT YOU WILL
LOOK UPON IT NOT AS A BATTERED BILLYCOCK BUT AS AN INTELLECTUAL
PROBLEM
AND FIRST AS TO HOW IT CAME HERE
IT ARRIVED UPON
CHRISTMAS MORNING IN COMPANY WITH A GOOD FAT GOOSE WHICH IS I
HAVE NO DOUBT ROASTING AT THIS MOMENT IN FRONT OF PETERSON'S
FIRE
THE FACTS ARE THESE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK ON CHRISTMAS
MORNING PETERSON WHO AS YOU KNOW IS A VERY HONEST FELLOW WAS
RETURNING FROM SOME SMALL JOLLIFICATION AND WAS MAKING HIS WAY
HOMEWARD DOWN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD
IN FRONT OF HIM HE SAW IN
THE GASLIGHT A TALLISH MAN WALKING WITH A SLIGHT STAGGER AND
CARRYING A WHITE GOOSE SLUNG OVER HIS SHOULDER
AS HE REACHED THE
CORNER OF GOODGE STREET A ROW BROKE OUT BETWEEN THIS STRANGER
AND A LITTLE KNOT OF ROUGHS
ONE OF THE LATTER KNOCKED OFF THE
MAN'S HAT ON WHICH HE RAISED HIS STICK TO DEFEND HIMSELF AND
SWINGING IT OVER HIS HEAD SMASHED THE SHOP WINDOW BEHIND HIM
PETERSON HAD RUSHED FORWARD TO PROTECT THE STRANGER FROM HIS
ASSAILANTS BUT THE MAN SHOCKED AT HAVING BROKEN THE WINDOW AND
SEEING AN OFFICIAL LOOKING PERSON IN UNIFORM RUSHING TOWARDS HIM
DROPPED HIS GOOSE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND VANISHED AMID THE
LABYRINTH OF SMALL STREETS WHICH LIE AT THE BACK OF TOTTENHAM
COURT ROAD
THE ROUGHS HAD ALSO FLED AT THE APPEARANCE OF
PETERSON SO THAT HE WAS LEFT IN POSSESSION OF THE FIELD OF
BATTLE AND ALSO OF THE SPOILS OF VICTORY IN THE SHAPE OF THIS
BATTERED HAT AND A MOST UNIMPEACHABLE CHRISTMAS GOOSE
WHICH SURELY HE RESTORED TO THEIR OWNER
MY DEAR FELLOW THERE LIES THE PROBLEM
IT IS TRUE THAT 'FOR
MRS
HENRY BAKER' WAS PRINTED UPON A SMALL CARD WHICH WAS TIED TO
THE BIRD'S LEFT LEG AND IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE INITIALS 'H
B ARE LEGIBLE UPON THE LINING OF THIS HAT BUT AS THERE ARE
SOME THOUSANDS OF BAKERS AND SOME HUNDREDS OF HENRY BAKERS IN
THIS CITY OF OURS IT IS NOT EASY TO RESTORE LOST PROPERTY TO ANY
ONE OF THEM
WHAT THEN DID PETERSON DO
HE BROUGHT ROUND BOTH HAT AND GOOSE TO ME ON CHRISTMAS MORNING
KNOWING THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST PROBLEMS ARE OF INTEREST TO ME
THE GOOSE WE RETAINED UNTIL THIS MORNING WHEN THERE WERE SIGNS
THAT IN SPITE OF THE SLIGHT FROST IT WOULD BE WELL THAT IT
SHOULD BE EATEN WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DELAY
ITS FINDER HAS CARRIED
IT OFF THEREFORE TO FULFIL THE ULTIMATE DESTINY OF A GOOSE
WHILE I CONTINUE TO RETAIN THE HAT OF THE UNKNOWN GENTLEMAN WHO
LOST HIS CHRISTMAS DINNER
DID HE NOT ADVERTISE
NO
THEN WHAT CLUE COULD YOU HAVE AS TO HIS IDENTITY
ONLY AS MUCH AS WE CAN DEDUCE
FROM HIS HAT
PRECISELY
BUT YOU ARE JOKING
WHAT CAN YOU GATHER FROM THIS OLD BATTERED
FELT
HERE IS MY LENS
YOU KNOW MY METHODS
WHAT CAN YOU GATHER
YOURSELF AS TO THE INDIVIDUALITY OF THE MAN WHO HAS WORN THIS
ARTICLE
I TOOK THE TATTERED OBJECT IN MY HANDS AND TURNED IT OVER RATHER
RUEFULLY
IT WAS A VERY ORDINARY BLACK HAT OF THE USUAL ROUND
SHAPE HARD AND MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR
THE LINING HAD BEEN OF
RED SILK BUT WAS A GOOD DEAL DISCOLOURED
THERE WAS NO MAKER'S
NAME BUT AS HOLMES HAD REMARKED THE INITIALS H
B WERE
SCRAWLED UPON ONE SIDE
IT WAS PIERCED IN THE BRIM FOR A
HAT SECURER BUT THE ELASTIC WAS MISSING
FOR THE REST IT WAS
CRACKED EXCEEDINGLY DUSTY AND SPOTTED IN SEVERAL PLACES
ALTHOUGH THERE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN SOME ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE
DISCOLOURED PATCHES BY SMEARING THEM WITH INK
I CAN SEE NOTHING SAID I HANDING IT BACK TO MY FRIEND
ON THE CONTRARY WATSON YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING
YOU FAIL
HOWEVER TO REASON FROM WHAT YOU SEE
YOU ARE TOO TIMID IN
DRAWING YOUR INFERENCES
THEN PRAY TELL ME WHAT IT IS THAT YOU CAN INFER FROM THIS HAT
HE PICKED IT UP AND GAZED AT IT IN THE PECULIAR INTROSPECTIVE
FASHION WHICH WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF HIM
IT IS PERHAPS LESS
SUGGESTIVE THAN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HE REMARKED AND YET THERE
ARE A FEW INFERENCES WHICH ARE VERY DISTINCT AND A FEW OTHERS
WHICH REPRESENT AT LEAST A STRONG BALANCE OF PROBABILITY
THAT
THE MAN WAS HIGHLY INTELLECTUAL IS OF COURSE OBVIOUS UPON THE
FACE OF IT AND ALSO THAT HE WAS FAIRLY WELL TO DO WITHIN THE
LAST THREE YEARS ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOW FALLEN UPON EVIL DAYS
HE
HAD FORESIGHT BUT HAS LESS NOW THAN FORMERLY POINTING TO A
MORAL RETROGRESSION WHICH WHEN TAKEN WITH THE DECLINE OF HIS
FORTUNES SEEMS TO INDICATE SOME EVIL INFLUENCE PROBABLY DRINK
AT WORK UPON HIM
THIS MAY ACCOUNT ALSO FOR THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT
HIS WIFE HAS CEASED TO LOVE HIM
MY DEAR HOLMES
HE HAS HOWEVER RETAINED SOME DEGREE OF SELF RESPECT HE
CONTINUED DISREGARDING MY REMONSTRANCE
HE IS A MAN WHO LEADS A
SEDENTARY LIFE GOES OUT LITTLE IS OUT OF TRAINING ENTIRELY IS
MIDDLE AGED HAS GRIZZLED HAIR WHICH HE HAS HAD CUT WITHIN THE
LAST FEW DAYS AND WHICH HE ANOINTS WITH LIME CREAM
THESE ARE
THE MORE PATENT FACTS WHICH ARE TO BE DEDUCED FROM HIS HAT
ALSO
BY THE WAY THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT HE HAS GAS LAID
ON IN HIS HOUSE
YOU ARE CERTAINLY JOKING HOLMES
NOT IN THE LEAST
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT EVEN NOW WHEN I GIVE YOU
THESE RESULTS YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE HOW THEY ARE ATTAINED
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I AM VERY STUPID BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I
AM UNABLE TO FOLLOW YOU
FOR EXAMPLE HOW DID YOU DEDUCE THAT
THIS MAN WAS INTELLECTUAL
FOR ANSWER HOLMES CLAPPED THE HAT UPON HIS HEAD
IT CAME RIGHT
OVER THE FOREHEAD AND SETTLED UPON THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE
IT IS
A QUESTION OF CUBIC CAPACITY SAID HE A MAN WITH SO LARGE A
BRAIN MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN IT
THE DECLINE OF HIS FORTUNES THEN
THIS HAT IS THREE YEARS OLD
THESE FLAT BRIMS CURLED AT THE EDGE
CAME IN THEN
IT IS A HAT OF THE VERY BEST QUALITY
LOOK AT THE
BAND OF RIBBED SILK AND THE EXCELLENT LINING
IF THIS MAN COULD
AFFORD TO BUY SO EXPENSIVE A HAT THREE YEARS AGO AND HAS HAD NO
HAT SINCE THEN HE HAS ASSUREDLY GONE DOWN IN THE WORLD
WELL THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH CERTAINLY
BUT HOW ABOUT THE
FORESIGHT AND THE MORAL RETROGRESSION
SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHED
HERE IS THE FORESIGHT SAID HE PUTTING
HIS FINGER UPON THE LITTLE DISC AND LOOP OF THE HAT SECURER
THEY ARE NEVER SOLD UPON HATS
IF THIS MAN ORDERED ONE IT IS A
SIGN OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORESIGHT SINCE HE WENT OUT OF HIS
WAY TO TAKE THIS PRECAUTION AGAINST THE WIND
BUT SINCE WE SEE
THAT HE HAS BROKEN THE ELASTIC AND HAS NOT TROUBLED TO REPLACE
IT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAS LESS FORESIGHT NOW THAN FORMERLY
WHICH IS A DISTINCT PROOF OF A WEAKENING NATURE
ON THE OTHER
HAND HE HAS ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL SOME OF THESE STAINS UPON THE
FELT BY DAUBING THEM WITH INK WHICH IS A SIGN THAT HE HAS NOT
ENTIRELY LOST HIS SELF RESPECT
YOUR REASONING IS CERTAINLY PLAUSIBLE
THE FURTHER POINTS THAT HE IS MIDDLE AGED THAT HIS HAIR IS
GRIZZLED THAT IT HAS BEEN RECENTLY CUT AND THAT HE USES
LIME CREAM ARE ALL TO BE GATHERED FROM A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE
LOWER PART OF THE LINING
THE LENS DISCLOSES A LARGE NUMBER OF
HAIR ENDS CLEAN CUT BY THE SCISSORS OF THE BARBER
THEY ALL
APPEAR TO BE ADHESIVE AND THERE IS A DISTINCT ODOUR OF
LIME CREAM
THIS DUST YOU WILL OBSERVE IS NOT THE GRITTY GREY
DUST OF THE STREET BUT THE FLUFFY BROWN DUST OF THE HOUSE
SHOWING THAT IT HAS BEEN HUNG UP INDOORS MOST OF THE TIME WHILE
THE MARKS OF MOISTURE UPON THE INSIDE ARE PROOF POSITIVE THAT THE
WEARER PERSPIRED VERY FREELY AND COULD THEREFORE HARDLY BE IN
THE BEST OF TRAINING
BUT HIS WIFE YOU SAID THAT SHE HAD CEASED TO LOVE HIM
THIS HAT HAS NOT BEEN BRUSHED FOR WEEKS
WHEN I SEE YOU MY DEAR
WATSON WITH A WEEK'S ACCUMULATION OF DUST UPON YOUR HAT AND
WHEN YOUR WIFE ALLOWS YOU TO GO OUT IN SUCH A STATE I SHALL FEAR
THAT YOU ALSO HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO LOSE YOUR WIFE'S
AFFECTION
BUT HE MIGHT BE A BACHELOR
NAY HE WAS BRINGING HOME THE GOOSE AS A PEACE OFFERING TO HIS
WIFE
REMEMBER THE CARD UPON THE BIRD'S LEG
YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO EVERYTHING
BUT HOW ON EARTH DO YOU DEDUCE
THAT THE GAS IS NOT LAID ON IN HIS HOUSE
ONE TALLOW STAIN OR EVEN TWO MIGHT COME BY CHANCE BUT WHEN I
SEE NO LESS THAN FIVE I THINK THAT THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT
THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MUST BE BROUGHT INTO FREQUENT CONTACT WITH
BURNING TALLOW WALKS UPSTAIRS AT NIGHT PROBABLY WITH HIS HAT IN
ONE HAND AND A GUTTERING CANDLE IN THE OTHER
ANYHOW HE NEVER
GOT TALLOW STAINS FROM A GAS JET
ARE YOU SATISFIED
WELL IT IS VERY INGENIOUS SAID I LAUGHING BUT SINCE AS
YOU SAID JUST NOW THERE HAS BEEN NO CRIME COMMITTED AND NO HARM
DONE SAVE THE LOSS OF A GOOSE ALL THIS SEEMS TO BE RATHER A
WASTE OF ENERGY
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD OPENED HIS MOUTH TO REPLY WHEN THE DOOR FLEW
OPEN AND PETERSON THE COMMISSIONAIRE RUSHED INTO THE APARTMENT
WITH FLUSHED CHEEKS AND THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS DAZED WITH
ASTONISHMENT
THE GOOSE MR
HOLMES THE GOOSE SIR HE GASPED
EH WHAT OF IT THEN HAS IT RETURNED TO LIFE AND FLAPPED OFF
THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW HOLMES TWISTED HIMSELF ROUND UPON
THE SOFA TO GET A FAIRER VIEW OF THE MAN'S EXCITED FACE
SEE HERE SIR SEE WHAT MY WIFE FOUND IN ITS CROP HE HELD OUT
HIS HAND AND DISPLAYED UPON THE CENTRE OF THE PALM A BRILLIANTLY
SCINTILLATING BLUE STONE RATHER SMALLER THAN A BEAN IN SIZE BUT
OF SUCH PURITY AND RADIANCE THAT IT TWINKLED LIKE AN ELECTRIC
POINT IN THE DARK HOLLOW OF HIS HAND
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT UP WITH A WHISTLE
BY JOVE PETERSON SAID
HE THIS IS TREASURE TROVE INDEED
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
HAVE GOT
A DIAMOND SIR A PRECIOUS STONE
IT CUTS INTO GLASS AS THOUGH
IT WERE PUTTY
IT'S MORE THAN A PRECIOUS STONE
IT IS THE PRECIOUS STONE
NOT THE COUNTESS OF MORCAR'S BLUE CARBUNCLE I EJACULATED
PRECISELY SO
I OUGHT TO KNOW ITS SIZE AND SHAPE SEEING THAT I
HAVE READ THE ADVERTISEMENT ABOUT IT IN THE TIMES EVERY DAY
LATELY
IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE AND ITS VALUE CAN ONLY BE
CONJECTURED BUT THE REWARD OFFERED OF 1000 POUNDS IS CERTAINLY
NOT WITHIN A TWENTIETH PART OF THE MARKET PRICE
A THOUSAND POUNDS GREAT LORD OF MERCY THE COMMISSIONAIRE
PLUMPED DOWN INTO A CHAIR AND STARED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US
THAT IS THE REWARD AND I HAVE REASON TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE
SENTIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE BACKGROUND WHICH WOULD INDUCE
THE COUNTESS TO PART WITH HALF HER FORTUNE IF SHE COULD BUT
RECOVER THE GEM
IT WAS LOST IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT AT THE HOTEL COSMOPOLITAN I
REMARKED
PRECISELY SO ON DECEMBER 22ND JUST FIVE DAYS AGO
JOHN HORNER
A PLUMBER WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING ABSTRACTED IT FROM THE LADY'S
JEWEL CASE
THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WAS SO STRONG THAT THE CASE
HAS BEEN REFERRED TO THE ASSIZES
I HAVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE
MATTER HERE I BELIEVE HE RUMMAGED AMID HIS NEWSPAPERS
GLANCING OVER THE DATES UNTIL AT LAST HE SMOOTHED ONE OUT
DOUBLED IT OVER AND READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH
HOTEL COSMOPOLITAN JEWEL ROBBERY
JOHN HORNER 26 PLUMBER WAS
BROUGHT UP UPON THE CHARGE OF HAVING UPON THE 22ND INST
ABSTRACTED FROM THE JEWEL CASE OF THE COUNTESS OF MORCAR THE
VALUABLE GEM KNOWN AS THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
JAMES RYDER
UPPER ATTENDANT AT THE HOTEL GAVE HIS EVIDENCE TO THE EFFECT
THAT HE HAD SHOWN HORNER UP TO THE DRESSING ROOM OF THE COUNTESS
OF MORCAR UPON THE DAY OF THE ROBBERY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT
SOLDER THE SECOND BAR OF THE GRATE WHICH WAS LOOSE
HE HAD
REMAINED WITH HORNER SOME LITTLE TIME BUT HAD FINALLY BEEN
CALLED AWAY
ON RETURNING HE FOUND THAT HORNER HAD DISAPPEARED
THAT THE BUREAU HAD BEEN FORCED OPEN AND THAT THE SMALL MOROCCO
CASKET IN WHICH AS IT AFTERWARDS TRANSPIRED THE COUNTESS WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO KEEP HER JEWEL WAS LYING EMPTY UPON THE
DRESSING TABLE
RYDER INSTANTLY GAVE THE ALARM AND HORNER WAS
ARRESTED THE SAME EVENING BUT THE STONE COULD NOT BE FOUND
EITHER UPON HIS PERSON OR IN HIS ROOMS
CATHERINE CUSACK MAID TO
THE COUNTESS DEPOSED TO HAVING HEARD RYDER'S CRY OF DISMAY ON
DISCOVERING THE ROBBERY AND TO HAVING RUSHED INTO THE ROOM
WHERE SHE FOUND MATTERS AS DESCRIBED BY THE LAST WITNESS
INSPECTOR BRADSTREET B DIVISION GAVE EVIDENCE AS TO THE ARREST
OF HORNER WHO STRUGGLED FRANTICALLY AND PROTESTED HIS INNOCENCE
IN THE STRONGEST TERMS
EVIDENCE OF A PREVIOUS CONVICTION FOR
ROBBERY HAVING BEEN GIVEN AGAINST THE PRISONER THE MAGISTRATE
REFUSED TO DEAL SUMMARILY WITH THE OFFENCE BUT REFERRED IT TO
THE ASSIZES
HORNER WHO HAD SHOWN SIGNS OF INTENSE EMOTION
DURING THE PROCEEDINGS FAINTED AWAY AT THE CONCLUSION AND WAS
CARRIED OUT OF COURT
HUM SO MUCH FOR THE POLICE COURT SAID HOLMES THOUGHTFULLY
TOSSING ASIDE THE PAPER
THE QUESTION FOR US NOW TO SOLVE IS THE
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS LEADING FROM A RIFLED JEWEL CASE AT ONE END TO
THE CROP OF A GOOSE IN TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AT THE OTHER
YOU
SEE WATSON OUR LITTLE DEDUCTIONS HAVE SUDDENLY ASSUMED A MUCH
MORE IMPORTANT AND LESS INNOCENT ASPECT
HERE IS THE STONE THE
STONE CAME FROM THE GOOSE AND THE GOOSE CAME FROM MR
HENRY
BAKER THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE BAD HAT AND ALL THE OTHER
CHARACTERISTICS WITH WHICH I HAVE BORED YOU
SO NOW WE MUST SET
OURSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY TO FINDING THIS GENTLEMAN AND
ASCERTAINING WHAT PART HE HAS PLAYED IN THIS LITTLE MYSTERY
TO
DO THIS WE MUST TRY THE SIMPLEST MEANS FIRST AND THESE LIE
UNDOUBTEDLY IN AN ADVERTISEMENT IN ALL THE EVENING PAPERS
IF
THIS FAIL I SHALL HAVE RECOURSE TO OTHER METHODS
WHAT WILL YOU SAY
GIVE ME A PENCIL AND THAT SLIP OF PAPER
NOW THEN 'FOUND AT
THE CORNER OF GOODGE STREET A GOOSE AND A BLACK FELT HAT
MR
HENRY BAKER CAN HAVE THE SAME BY APPLYING AT 6 30 THIS EVENING AT
221B BAKER STREET THAT IS CLEAR AND CONCISE
VERY
BUT WILL HE SEE IT
WELL HE IS SURE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE PAPERS SINCE TO A POOR
MAN THE LOSS WAS A HEAVY ONE
HE WAS CLEARLY SO SCARED BY HIS
MISCHANCE IN BREAKING THE WINDOW AND BY THE APPROACH OF PETERSON
THAT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT FLIGHT BUT SINCE THEN HE MUST
HAVE BITTERLY REGRETTED THE IMPULSE WHICH CAUSED HIM TO DROP HIS
BIRD
THEN AGAIN THE INTRODUCTION OF HIS NAME WILL CAUSE HIM TO
SEE IT FOR EVERYONE WHO KNOWS HIM WILL DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO
IT
HERE YOU ARE PETERSON RUN DOWN TO THE ADVERTISING AGENCY
AND HAVE THIS PUT IN THE EVENING PAPERS
IN WHICH SIR
OH IN THE GLOBE STAR PALL MALL ST
JAMES'S EVENING NEWS
STANDARD ECHO AND ANY OTHERS THAT OCCUR TO YOU
VERY WELL SIR
AND THIS STONE
AH YES I SHALL KEEP THE STONE
THANK YOU
AND I SAY
PETERSON JUST BUY A GOOSE ON YOUR WAY BACK AND LEAVE IT HERE
WITH ME FOR WE MUST HAVE ONE TO GIVE TO THIS GENTLEMAN IN PLACE
OF THE ONE WHICH YOUR FAMILY IS NOW DEVOURING
WHEN THE COMMISSIONAIRE HAD GONE HOLMES TOOK UP THE STONE AND
HELD IT AGAINST THE LIGHT
IT'S A BONNY THING SAID HE
JUST
SEE HOW IT GLINTS AND SPARKLES
OF COURSE IT IS A NUCLEUS AND
FOCUS OF CRIME
EVERY GOOD STONE IS
THEY ARE THE DEVIL'S PET
BAITS
IN THE LARGER AND OLDER JEWELS EVERY FACET MAY STAND FOR A
BLOODY DEED
THIS STONE IS NOT YET TWENTY YEARS OLD
IT WAS FOUND
IN THE BANKS OF THE AMOY RIVER IN SOUTHERN CHINA AND IS REMARKABLE
IN HAVING EVERY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CARBUNCLE SAVE THAT IT IS
BLUE IN SHADE INSTEAD OF RUBY RED
IN SPITE OF ITS YOUTH IT HAS
ALREADY A SINISTER HISTORY
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO MURDERS A
VITRIOL THROWING A SUICIDE AND SEVERAL ROBBERIES BROUGHT ABOUT
FOR THE SAKE OF THIS FORTY GRAIN WEIGHT OF CRYSTALLISED CHARCOAL
WHO WOULD THINK THAT SO PRETTY A TOY WOULD BE A PURVEYOR TO THE
GALLOWS AND THE PRISON I'LL LOCK IT UP IN MY STRONG BOX NOW AND
DROP A LINE TO THE COUNTESS TO SAY THAT WE HAVE IT
DO YOU THINK THAT THIS MAN HORNER IS INNOCENT
I CANNOT TELL
WELL THEN DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THIS OTHER ONE HENRY BAKER HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MATTER
IT IS I THINK MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT HENRY BAKER IS AN
ABSOLUTELY INNOCENT MAN WHO HAD NO IDEA THAT THE BIRD WHICH HE
WAS CARRYING WAS OF CONSIDERABLY MORE VALUE THAN IF IT WERE MADE
OF SOLID GOLD
THAT HOWEVER I SHALL DETERMINE BY A VERY SIMPLE
TEST IF WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO OUR ADVERTISEMENT
AND YOU CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL THEN
NOTHING
IN THAT CASE I SHALL CONTINUE MY PROFESSIONAL ROUND
BUT I SHALL
COME BACK IN THE EVENING AT THE HOUR YOU HAVE MENTIONED FOR I
SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SOLUTION OF SO TANGLED A BUSINESS
VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
I DINE AT SEVEN
THERE IS A WOODCOCK I
BELIEVE
BY THE WAY IN VIEW OF RECENT OCCURRENCES PERHAPS I
OUGHT TO ASK MRS
HUDSON TO EXAMINE ITS CROP
I HAD BEEN DELAYED AT A CASE AND IT WAS A LITTLE AFTER HALF PAST
SIX WHEN I FOUND MYSELF IN BAKER STREET ONCE MORE
AS I
APPROACHED THE HOUSE I SAW A TALL MAN IN A SCOTCH BONNET WITH A
COAT WHICH WAS BUTTONED UP TO HIS CHIN WAITING OUTSIDE IN THE
BRIGHT SEMICIRCLE WHICH WAS THROWN FROM THE FANLIGHT
JUST AS I
ARRIVED THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND WE WERE SHOWN UP TOGETHER TO
HOLMES' ROOM
MR
HENRY BAKER I BELIEVE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS ARMCHAIR
AND GREETING HIS VISITOR WITH THE EASY AIR OF GENIALITY WHICH HE
COULD SO READILY ASSUME
PRAY TAKE THIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE MR
BAKER
IT IS A COLD NIGHT AND I OBSERVE THAT YOUR CIRCULATION IS
MORE ADAPTED FOR SUMMER THAN FOR WINTER
AH WATSON YOU HAVE
JUST COME AT THE RIGHT TIME
IS THAT YOUR HAT MR
BAKER
YES SIR THAT IS UNDOUBTEDLY MY HAT
HE WAS A LARGE MAN WITH ROUNDED SHOULDERS A MASSIVE HEAD AND A
BROAD INTELLIGENT FACE SLOPING DOWN TO A POINTED BEARD OF
GRIZZLED BROWN
A TOUCH OF RED IN NOSE AND CHEEKS WITH A SLIGHT
TREMOR OF HIS EXTENDED HAND RECALLED HOLMES' SURMISE AS TO HIS
HABITS
HIS RUSTY BLACK FROCK COAT WAS BUTTONED RIGHT UP IN
FRONT WITH THE COLLAR TURNED UP AND HIS LANK WRISTS PROTRUDED
FROM HIS SLEEVES WITHOUT A SIGN OF CUFF OR SHIRT
HE SPOKE IN A
SLOW STACCATO FASHION CHOOSING HIS WORDS WITH CARE AND GAVE THE
IMPRESSION GENERALLY OF A MAN OF LEARNING AND LETTERS WHO HAD HAD
ILL USAGE AT THE HANDS OF FORTUNE
WE HAVE RETAINED THESE THINGS FOR SOME DAYS SAID HOLMES
BECAUSE WE EXPECTED TO SEE AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM YOU GIVING YOUR
ADDRESS
I AM AT A LOSS TO KNOW NOW WHY YOU DID NOT ADVERTISE
OUR VISITOR GAVE A RATHER SHAMEFACED LAUGH
SHILLINGS HAVE NOT
BEEN SO PLENTIFUL WITH ME AS THEY ONCE WERE HE REMARKED
I HAD
NO DOUBT THAT THE GANG OF ROUGHS WHO ASSAULTED ME HAD CARRIED OFF
BOTH MY HAT AND THE BIRD
I DID NOT CARE TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN A
HOPELESS ATTEMPT AT RECOVERING THEM
VERY NATURALLY
BY THE WAY ABOUT THE BIRD WE WERE COMPELLED TO
EAT IT
TO EAT IT OUR VISITOR HALF ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR IN HIS
EXCITEMENT
YES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OF NO USE TO ANYONE HAD WE NOT DONE SO
BUT I PRESUME THAT THIS OTHER GOOSE UPON THE SIDEBOARD WHICH IS
ABOUT THE SAME WEIGHT AND PERFECTLY FRESH WILL ANSWER YOUR
PURPOSE EQUALLY WELL
OH CERTAINLY CERTAINLY ANSWERED MR
BAKER WITH A SIGH OF
RELIEF
OF COURSE WE STILL HAVE THE FEATHERS LEGS CROP AND SO ON OF
YOUR OWN BIRD SO IF YOU WISH
THE MAN BURST INTO A HEARTY LAUGH
THEY MIGHT BE USEFUL TO ME AS
RELICS OF MY ADVENTURE SAID HE BUT BEYOND THAT I CAN HARDLY
SEE WHAT USE THE DISJECTA MEMBRA OF MY LATE ACQUAINTANCE ARE
GOING TO BE TO ME
NO SIR I THINK THAT WITH YOUR PERMISSION I
WILL CONFINE MY ATTENTIONS TO THE EXCELLENT BIRD WHICH I PERCEIVE
UPON THE SIDEBOARD
SHERLOCK HOLMES GLANCED SHARPLY ACROSS AT ME WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG
OF HIS SHOULDERS
THERE IS YOUR HAT THEN AND THERE YOUR BIRD SAID HE
BY THE
WAY WOULD IT BORE YOU TO TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT THE OTHER ONE
FROM I AM SOMEWHAT OF A FOWL FANCIER AND I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A
BETTER GROWN GOOSE
CERTAINLY SIR SAID BAKER WHO HAD RISEN AND TUCKED HIS NEWLY
GAINED PROPERTY UNDER HIS ARM
THERE ARE A FEW OF US WHO
FREQUENT THE ALPHA INN NEAR THE MUSEUM WE ARE TO BE FOUND IN
THE MUSEUM ITSELF DURING THE DAY YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS YEAR OUR
GOOD HOST WINDIGATE BY NAME INSTITUTED A GOOSE CLUB BY WHICH
ON CONSIDERATION OF SOME FEW PENCE EVERY WEEK WE WERE EACH TO
RECEIVE A BIRD AT CHRISTMAS
MY PENCE WERE DULY PAID AND THE
REST IS FAMILIAR TO YOU
I AM MUCH INDEBTED TO YOU SIR FOR A
SCOTCH BONNET IS FITTED NEITHER TO MY YEARS NOR MY GRAVITY WITH
A COMICAL POMPOSITY OF MANNER HE BOWED SOLEMNLY TO BOTH OF US AND
STRODE OFF UPON HIS WAY
SO MUCH FOR MR
HENRY BAKER SAID HOLMES WHEN HE HAD CLOSED THE
DOOR BEHIND HIM
IT IS QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE KNOWS NOTHING
WHATEVER ABOUT THE MATTER
ARE YOU HUNGRY WATSON
NOT PARTICULARLY
THEN I SUGGEST THAT WE TURN OUR DINNER INTO A SUPPER AND FOLLOW
UP THIS CLUE WHILE IT IS STILL HOT
BY ALL MEANS
IT WAS A BITTER NIGHT SO WE DREW ON OUR ULSTERS AND WRAPPED
CRAVATS ABOUT OUR THROATS
OUTSIDE THE STARS WERE SHINING COLDLY
IN A CLOUDLESS SKY AND THE BREATH OF THE PASSERS BY BLEW OUT
INTO SMOKE LIKE SO MANY PISTOL SHOTS
OUR FOOTFALLS RANG OUT
CRISPLY AND LOUDLY AS WE SWUNG THROUGH THE DOCTORS' QUARTER
WIMPOLE STREET HARLEY STREET AND SO THROUGH WIGMORE STREET INTO
OXFORD STREET
IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WE WERE IN BLOOMSBURY AT
THE ALPHA INN WHICH IS A SMALL PUBLIC HOUSE AT THE CORNER OF ONE
OF THE STREETS WHICH RUNS DOWN INTO HOLBORN
HOLMES PUSHED OPEN
THE DOOR OF THE PRIVATE BAR AND ORDERED TWO GLASSES OF BEER FROM
THE RUDDY FACED WHITE APRONED LANDLORD
YOUR BEER SHOULD BE EXCELLENT IF IT IS AS GOOD AS YOUR GEESE
SAID HE
MY GEESE THE MAN SEEMED SURPRISED
YES
I WAS SPEAKING ONLY HALF AN HOUR AGO TO MR
HENRY BAKER
WHO WAS A MEMBER OF YOUR GOOSE CLUB
AH YES I SEE
BUT YOU SEE SIR THEM'S NOT OUR GEESE
INDEED WHOSE THEN
WELL I GOT THE TWO DOZEN FROM A SALESMAN IN COVENT GARDEN
INDEED I KNOW SOME OF THEM
WHICH WAS IT
BRECKINRIDGE IS HIS NAME
AH I DON'T KNOW HIM
WELL HERE'S YOUR GOOD HEALTH LANDLORD
AND PROSPERITY TO YOUR HOUSE
GOOD NIGHT
NOW FOR MR
BRECKINRIDGE HE CONTINUED BUTTONING UP HIS COAT
AS WE CAME OUT INTO THE FROSTY AIR
REMEMBER WATSON THAT THOUGH
WE HAVE SO HOMELY A THING AS A GOOSE AT ONE END OF THIS CHAIN WE
HAVE AT THE OTHER A MAN WHO WILL CERTAINLY GET SEVEN YEARS' PENAL
SERVITUDE UNLESS WE CAN ESTABLISH HIS INNOCENCE
IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT OUR INQUIRY MAY BUT CONFIRM HIS GUILT BUT IN ANY CASE WE
HAVE A LINE OF INVESTIGATION WHICH HAS BEEN MISSED BY THE POLICE
AND WHICH A SINGULAR CHANCE HAS PLACED IN OUR HANDS
LET US
FOLLOW IT OUT TO THE BITTER END
FACES TO THE SOUTH THEN AND
QUICK MARCH
WE PASSED ACROSS HOLBORN DOWN ENDELL STREET AND SO THROUGH A
ZIGZAG OF SLUMS TO COVENT GARDEN MARKET
ONE OF THE LARGEST
STALLS BORE THE NAME OF BRECKINRIDGE UPON IT AND THE PROPRIETOR
A HORSEY LOOKING MAN WITH A SHARP FACE AND TRIM SIDE WHISKERS WAS
HELPING A BOY TO PUT UP THE SHUTTERS
GOOD EVENING
IT'S A COLD NIGHT SAID HOLMES
THE SALESMAN NODDED AND SHOT A QUESTIONING GLANCE AT MY
COMPANION
SOLD OUT OF GEESE I SEE CONTINUED HOLMES POINTING AT THE
BARE SLABS OF MARBLE
LET YOU HAVE FIVE HUNDRED TO MORROW MORNING
THAT'S NO GOOD
WELL THERE ARE SOME ON THE STALL WITH THE GAS FLARE
AH BUT I WAS RECOMMENDED TO YOU
WHO BY
THE LANDLORD OF THE ALPHA
OH YES I SENT HIM A COUPLE OF DOZEN
FINE BIRDS THEY WERE TOO
NOW WHERE DID YOU GET THEM FROM
TO MY SURPRISE THE QUESTION PROVOKED A BURST OF ANGER FROM THE
SALESMAN
NOW THEN MISTER SAID HE WITH HIS HEAD COCKED AND HIS ARMS
AKIMBO WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT LET'S HAVE IT STRAIGHT NOW
IT IS STRAIGHT ENOUGH
I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO SOLD YOU THE
GEESE WHICH YOU SUPPLIED TO THE ALPHA
WELL THEN I SHAN'T TELL YOU
SO NOW
OH IT IS A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
SHOULD BE SO WARM OVER SUCH A TRIFLE
WARM YOU'D BE AS WARM MAYBE IF YOU WERE AS PESTERED AS I AM
WHEN I PAY GOOD MONEY FOR A GOOD ARTICLE THERE SHOULD BE AN END
OF THE BUSINESS BUT IT'S 'WHERE ARE THE GEESE AND 'WHO DID YOU
SELL THE GEESE TO AND 'WHAT WILL YOU TAKE FOR THE GEESE ONE
WOULD THINK THEY WERE THE ONLY GEESE IN THE WORLD TO HEAR THE
FUSS THAT IS MADE OVER THEM
WELL I HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
MAKING INQUIRIES SAID HOLMES CARELESSLY
IF YOU WON'T TELL US
THE BET IS OFF THAT IS ALL
BUT I'M ALWAYS READY TO BACK MY
OPINION ON A MATTER OF FOWLS AND I HAVE A FIVER ON IT THAT THE
BIRD I ATE IS COUNTRY BRED
WELL THEN YOU'VE LOST YOUR FIVER FOR IT'S TOWN BRED SNAPPED
THE SALESMAN
IT'S NOTHING OF THE KIND
I SAY IT IS
I DON'T BELIEVE IT
D'YOU THINK YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT FOWLS THAN I WHO HAVE HANDLED
THEM EVER SINCE I WAS A NIPPER I TELL YOU ALL THOSE BIRDS THAT
WENT TO THE ALPHA WERE TOWN BRED
YOU'LL NEVER PERSUADE ME TO BELIEVE THAT
WILL YOU BET THEN
IT'S MERELY TAKING YOUR MONEY FOR I KNOW THAT I AM RIGHT
BUT
I'LL HAVE A SOVEREIGN ON WITH YOU JUST TO TEACH YOU NOT TO BE
OBSTINATE
THE SALESMAN CHUCKLED GRIMLY
BRING ME THE BOOKS BILL SAID
HE
THE SMALL BOY BROUGHT ROUND A SMALL THIN VOLUME AND A GREAT
GREASY BACKED ONE LAYING THEM OUT TOGETHER BENEATH THE HANGING
LAMP
NOW THEN MR
COCKSURE SAID THE SALESMAN I THOUGHT THAT I
WAS OUT OF GEESE BUT BEFORE I FINISH YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE IS
STILL ONE LEFT IN MY SHOP
YOU SEE THIS LITTLE BOOK
WELL
THAT'S THE LIST OF THE FOLK FROM WHOM I BUY
D'YOU SEE WELL
THEN HERE ON THIS PAGE ARE THE COUNTRY FOLK AND THE NUMBERS
AFTER THEIR NAMES ARE WHERE THEIR ACCOUNTS ARE IN THE BIG LEDGER
NOW THEN YOU SEE THIS OTHER PAGE IN RED INK WELL THAT IS A
LIST OF MY TOWN SUPPLIERS
NOW LOOK AT THAT THIRD NAME
JUST
READ IT OUT TO ME
MRS
OAKSHOTT 117 BRIXTON ROAD 249 READ HOLMES

TWENTY FOUR GEESE AT 7S
6D
QUITE SO
THERE YOU ARE
AND UNDERNEATH
'SOLD TO MR
WINDIGATE OF THE ALPHA AT 12S
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY NOW
SHERLOCK HOLMES LOOKED DEEPLY CHAGRINED
HE DREW A SOVEREIGN FROM
HIS POCKET AND THREW IT DOWN UPON THE SLAB TURNING AWAY WITH THE
AIR OF A MAN WHOSE DISGUST IS TOO DEEP FOR WORDS
A FEW YARDS OFF
HE STOPPED UNDER A LAMP POST AND LAUGHED IN THE HEARTY NOISELESS
FASHION WHICH WAS PECULIAR TO HIM
WHEN YOU SEE A MAN WITH WHISKERS OF THAT CUT AND THE 'PINK 'UN'
PROTRUDING OUT OF HIS POCKET YOU CAN ALWAYS DRAW HIM BY A BET
SAID HE
I DARESAY THAT IF I HAD PUT 100 POUNDS DOWN IN FRONT OF
HIM THAT MAN WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH COMPLETE INFORMATION
AS WAS DRAWN FROM HIM BY THE IDEA THAT HE WAS DOING ME ON A
WAGER
WELL WATSON WE ARE I FANCY NEARING THE END OF OUR
QUEST AND THE ONLY POINT WHICH REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED IS
WHETHER WE SHOULD GO ON TO THIS MRS
OAKSHOTT TO NIGHT OR
WHETHER WE SHOULD RESERVE IT FOR TO MORROW
IT IS CLEAR FROM WHAT
THAT SURLY FELLOW SAID THAT THERE ARE OTHERS BESIDES OURSELVES
WHO ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT THE MATTER AND I SHOULD
HIS REMARKS WERE SUDDENLY CUT SHORT BY A LOUD HUBBUB WHICH BROKE
OUT FROM THE STALL WHICH WE HAD JUST LEFT
TURNING ROUND WE SAW A
LITTLE RAT FACED FELLOW STANDING IN THE CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE OF
YELLOW LIGHT WHICH WAS THROWN BY THE SWINGING LAMP WHILE
BRECKINRIDGE THE SALESMAN FRAMED IN THE DOOR OF HIS STALL WAS
SHAKING HIS FISTS FIERCELY AT THE CRINGING FIGURE
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU AND YOUR GEESE HE SHOUTED
I WISH YOU
WERE ALL AT THE DEVIL TOGETHER
IF YOU COME PESTERING ME ANY MORE
WITH YOUR SILLY TALK I'LL SET THE DOG AT YOU
YOU BRING MRS
OAKSHOTT HERE AND I'LL ANSWER HER BUT WHAT HAVE YOU TO DO WITH
IT DID I BUY THE GEESE OFF YOU
NO BUT ONE OF THEM WAS MINE ALL THE SAME WHINED THE LITTLE
MAN
WELL THEN ASK MRS
OAKSHOTT FOR IT
SHE TOLD ME TO ASK YOU
WELL YOU CAN ASK THE KING OF PROOSIA FOR ALL I CARE
I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF IT
GET OUT OF THIS HE RUSHED FIERCELY FORWARD AND
THE INQUIRER FLITTED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS
HA THIS MAY SAVE US A VISIT TO BRIXTON ROAD WHISPERED HOLMES
COME WITH ME AND WE WILL SEE WHAT IS TO BE MADE OF THIS
FELLOW STRIDING THROUGH THE SCATTERED KNOTS OF PEOPLE WHO
LOUNGED ROUND THE FLARING STALLS MY COMPANION SPEEDILY OVERTOOK
THE LITTLE MAN AND TOUCHED HIM UPON THE SHOULDER
HE SPRANG
ROUND AND I COULD SEE IN THE GAS LIGHT THAT EVERY VESTIGE OF
COLOUR HAD BEEN DRIVEN FROM HIS FACE
WHO ARE YOU THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT HE ASKED IN A QUAVERING
VOICE
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME SAID HOLMES BLANDLY BUT I COULD NOT HELP
OVERHEARING THE QUESTIONS WHICH YOU PUT TO THE SALESMAN JUST NOW
I THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU
YOU WHO ARE YOU HOW COULD YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE MATTER
MY NAME IS SHERLOCK HOLMES
IT IS MY BUSINESS TO KNOW WHAT OTHER
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
BUT YOU CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THIS
EXCUSE ME I KNOW EVERYTHING OF IT
YOU ARE ENDEAVOURING TO
TRACE SOME GEESE WHICH WERE SOLD BY MRS
OAKSHOTT OF BRIXTON
ROAD TO A SALESMAN NAMED BRECKINRIDGE BY HIM IN TURN TO MR
WINDIGATE OF THE ALPHA AND BY HIM TO HIS CLUB OF WHICH MR
HENRY BAKER IS A MEMBER
OH SIR YOU ARE THE VERY MAN WHOM I HAVE LONGED TO MEET CRIED
THE LITTLE FELLOW WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS AND QUIVERING FINGERS
I CAN HARDLY EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW INTERESTED I AM IN THIS MATTER
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAILED A FOUR WHEELER WHICH WAS PASSING
IN THAT
CASE WE HAD BETTER DISCUSS IT IN A COSY ROOM RATHER THAN IN THIS
WIND SWEPT MARKET PLACE SAID HE
BUT PRAY TELL ME BEFORE WE
GO FARTHER WHO IT IS THAT I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF ASSISTING
THE MAN HESITATED FOR AN INSTANT
MY NAME IS JOHN ROBINSON HE
ANSWERED WITH A SIDELONG GLANCE
NO NO THE REAL NAME SAID HOLMES SWEETLY
IT IS ALWAYS
AWKWARD DOING BUSINESS WITH AN ALIAS
A FLUSH SPRANG TO THE WHITE CHEEKS OF THE STRANGER
WELL THEN
SAID HE MY REAL NAME IS JAMES RYDER
PRECISELY SO
HEAD ATTENDANT AT THE HOTEL COSMOPOLITAN
PRAY
STEP INTO THE CAB AND I SHALL SOON BE ABLE TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING WHICH YOU WOULD WISH TO KNOW
THE LITTLE MAN STOOD GLANCING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US WITH
HALF FRIGHTENED HALF HOPEFUL EYES AS ONE WHO IS NOT SURE
WHETHER HE IS ON THE VERGE OF A WINDFALL OR OF A CATASTROPHE
THEN HE STEPPED INTO THE CAB AND IN HALF AN HOUR WE WERE BACK IN
THE SITTING ROOM AT BAKER STREET
NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID DURING
OUR DRIVE BUT THE HIGH THIN BREATHING OF OUR NEW COMPANION AND
THE CLASPINGS AND UNCLASPINGS OF HIS HANDS SPOKE OF THE NERVOUS
TENSION WITHIN HIM
HERE WE ARE SAID HOLMES CHEERILY AS WE FILED INTO THE ROOM
THE FIRE LOOKS VERY SEASONABLE IN THIS WEATHER
YOU LOOK COLD
MR
RYDER
PRAY TAKE THE BASKET CHAIR
I WILL JUST PUT ON MY
SLIPPERS BEFORE WE SETTLE THIS LITTLE MATTER OF YOURS
NOW THEN
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THOSE GEESE
YES SIR
OR RATHER I FANCY OF THAT GOOSE
IT WAS ONE BIRD I IMAGINE IN
WHICH YOU WERE INTERESTED WHITE WITH A BLACK BAR ACROSS THE
TAIL
RYDER QUIVERED WITH EMOTION
OH SIR HE CRIED CAN YOU TELL
ME WHERE IT WENT TO
IT CAME HERE
HERE
YES AND A MOST REMARKABLE BIRD IT PROVED
I DON'T WONDER THAT
YOU SHOULD TAKE AN INTEREST IN IT
IT LAID AN EGG AFTER IT WAS
DEAD THE BONNIEST BRIGHTEST LITTLE BLUE EGG THAT EVER WAS SEEN
I HAVE IT HERE IN MY MUSEUM
OUR VISITOR STAGGERED TO HIS FEET AND CLUTCHED THE MANTELPIECE
WITH HIS RIGHT HAND
HOLMES UNLOCKED HIS STRONG BOX AND HELD UP
THE BLUE CARBUNCLE WHICH SHONE OUT LIKE A STAR WITH A COLD
BRILLIANT MANY POINTED RADIANCE
RYDER STOOD GLARING WITH A
DRAWN FACE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO CLAIM OR TO DISOWN IT
THE GAME'S UP RYDER SAID HOLMES QUIETLY
HOLD UP MAN OR
YOU'LL BE INTO THE FIRE GIVE HIM AN ARM BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
WATSON
HE'S NOT GOT BLOOD ENOUGH TO GO IN FOR FELONY WITH
IMPUNITY
GIVE HIM A DASH OF BRANDY
SO NOW HE LOOKS A LITTLE
MORE HUMAN
WHAT A SHRIMP IT IS TO BE SURE
FOR A MOMENT HE HAD STAGGERED AND NEARLY FALLEN BUT THE BRANDY
BROUGHT A TINGE OF COLOUR INTO HIS CHEEKS AND HE SAT STARING
WITH FRIGHTENED EYES AT HIS ACCUSER
I HAVE ALMOST EVERY LINK IN MY HANDS AND ALL THE PROOFS WHICH I
COULD POSSIBLY NEED SO THERE IS LITTLE WHICH YOU NEED TELL ME
STILL THAT LITTLE MAY AS WELL BE CLEARED UP TO MAKE THE CASE
COMPLETE
YOU HAD HEARD RYDER OF THIS BLUE STONE OF THE
COUNTESS OF MORCAR'S
IT WAS CATHERINE CUSACK WHO TOLD ME OF IT SAID HE IN A
CRACKLING VOICE
I SEE HER LADYSHIP'S WAITING MAID
WELL THE TEMPTATION OF
SUDDEN WEALTH SO EASILY ACQUIRED WAS TOO MUCH FOR YOU AS IT HAS
BEEN FOR BETTER MEN BEFORE YOU BUT YOU WERE NOT VERY SCRUPULOUS
IN THE MEANS YOU USED
IT SEEMS TO ME RYDER THAT THERE IS THE
MAKING OF A VERY PRETTY VILLAIN IN YOU
YOU KNEW THAT THIS MAN
HORNER THE PLUMBER HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN SOME SUCH MATTER
BEFORE AND THAT SUSPICION WOULD REST THE MORE READILY UPON HIM
WHAT DID YOU DO THEN YOU MADE SOME SMALL JOB IN MY LADY'S
ROOM YOU AND YOUR CONFEDERATE CUSACK AND YOU MANAGED THAT HE
SHOULD BE THE MAN SENT FOR
THEN WHEN HE HAD LEFT YOU RIFLED
THE JEWEL CASE RAISED THE ALARM AND HAD THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN
ARRESTED
YOU THEN
RYDER THREW HIMSELF DOWN SUDDENLY UPON THE RUG AND CLUTCHED AT MY
COMPANION'S KNEES
FOR GOD'S SAKE HAVE MERCY HE SHRIEKED
THINK OF MY FATHER OF MY MOTHER IT WOULD BREAK THEIR HEARTS
I
NEVER WENT WRONG BEFORE I NEVER WILL AGAIN
I SWEAR IT
I'LL
SWEAR IT ON A BIBLE
OH DON'T BRING IT INTO COURT FOR CHRIST'S
SAKE DON'T
GET BACK INTO YOUR CHAIR SAID HOLMES STERNLY
IT IS VERY WELL
TO CRINGE AND CRAWL NOW BUT YOU THOUGHT LITTLE ENOUGH OF THIS
POOR HORNER IN THE DOCK FOR A CRIME OF WHICH HE KNEW NOTHING
I WILL FLY MR
HOLMES
I WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY SIR
THEN THE
CHARGE AGAINST HIM WILL BREAK DOWN
HUM WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT
AND NOW LET US HEAR A TRUE ACCOUNT
OF THE NEXT ACT
HOW CAME THE STONE INTO THE GOOSE AND HOW CAME
THE GOOSE INTO THE OPEN MARKET TELL US THE TRUTH FOR THERE LIES
YOUR ONLY HOPE OF SAFETY
RYDER PASSED HIS TONGUE OVER HIS PARCHED LIPS
I WILL TELL YOU
IT JUST AS IT HAPPENED SIR SAID HE
WHEN HORNER HAD BEEN
ARRESTED IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME TO GET
AWAY WITH THE STONE AT ONCE FOR I DID NOT KNOW AT WHAT MOMENT
THE POLICE MIGHT NOT TAKE IT INTO THEIR HEADS TO SEARCH ME AND MY
ROOM
THERE WAS NO PLACE ABOUT THE HOTEL WHERE IT WOULD BE SAFE
I WENT OUT AS IF ON SOME COMMISSION AND I MADE FOR MY SISTER'S
HOUSE
SHE HAD MARRIED A MAN NAMED OAKSHOTT AND LIVED IN BRIXTON
ROAD WHERE SHE FATTENED FOWLS FOR THE MARKET
ALL THE WAY THERE
EVERY MAN I MET SEEMED TO ME TO BE A POLICEMAN OR A DETECTIVE
AND FOR ALL THAT IT WAS A COLD NIGHT THE SWEAT WAS POURING DOWN
MY FACE BEFORE I CAME TO THE BRIXTON ROAD
MY SISTER ASKED ME
WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WHY I WAS SO PALE BUT I TOLD HER THAT I
HAD BEEN UPSET BY THE JEWEL ROBBERY AT THE HOTEL
THEN I WENT
INTO THE BACK YARD AND SMOKED A PIPE AND WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD
BE BEST TO DO
I HAD A FRIEND ONCE CALLED MAUDSLEY WHO WENT TO THE BAD AND
HAS JUST BEEN SERVING HIS TIME IN PENTONVILLE
ONE DAY HE HAD MET
ME AND FELL INTO TALK ABOUT THE WAYS OF THIEVES AND HOW THEY
COULD GET RID OF WHAT THEY STOLE
I KNEW THAT HE WOULD BE TRUE TO
ME FOR I KNEW ONE OR TWO THINGS ABOUT HIM SO I MADE UP MY MIND
TO GO RIGHT ON TO KILBURN WHERE HE LIVED AND TAKE HIM INTO MY
CONFIDENCE
HE WOULD SHOW ME HOW TO TURN THE STONE INTO MONEY
BUT HOW TO GET TO HIM IN SAFETY I THOUGHT OF THE AGONIES I HAD
GONE THROUGH IN COMING FROM THE HOTEL
I MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT BE
SEIZED AND SEARCHED AND THERE WOULD BE THE STONE IN MY WAISTCOAT
POCKET
I WAS LEANING AGAINST THE WALL AT THE TIME AND LOOKING AT
THE GEESE WHICH WERE WADDLING ABOUT ROUND MY FEET AND SUDDENLY
AN IDEA CAME INTO MY HEAD WHICH SHOWED ME HOW I COULD BEAT THE
BEST DETECTIVE THAT EVER LIVED
MY SISTER HAD TOLD ME SOME WEEKS BEFORE THAT I MIGHT HAVE THE
PICK OF HER GEESE FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND I KNEW THAT SHE
WAS ALWAYS AS GOOD AS HER WORD
I WOULD TAKE MY GOOSE NOW AND IN
IT I WOULD CARRY MY STONE TO KILBURN
THERE WAS A LITTLE SHED IN
THE YARD AND BEHIND THIS I DROVE ONE OF THE BIRDS A FINE BIG
ONE WHITE WITH A BARRED TAIL
I CAUGHT IT AND PRYING ITS BILL
OPEN I THRUST THE STONE DOWN ITS THROAT AS FAR AS MY FINGER
COULD REACH
THE BIRD GAVE A GULP AND I FELT THE STONE PASS
ALONG ITS GULLET AND DOWN INTO ITS CROP
BUT THE CREATURE FLAPPED
AND STRUGGLED AND OUT CAME MY SISTER TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE
MATTER
AS I TURNED TO SPEAK TO HER THE BRUTE BROKE LOOSE AND
FLUTTERED OFF AMONG THE OTHERS
'WHATEVER WERE YOU DOING WITH THAT BIRD JEM SAYS SHE
'WELL SAID I 'YOU SAID YOU'D GIVE ME ONE FOR CHRISTMAS AND I
WAS FEELING WHICH WAS THE FATTEST
'OH SAYS SHE 'WE'VE SET YOURS ASIDE FOR YOU JEM'S BIRD WE
CALL IT
IT'S THE BIG WHITE ONE OVER YONDER
THERE'S TWENTY SIX
OF THEM WHICH MAKES ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR US AND TWO DOZEN
FOR THE MARKET
'THANK YOU MAGGIE SAYS I 'BUT IF IT IS ALL THE SAME TO YOU
I'D RATHER HAVE THAT ONE I WAS HANDLING JUST NOW
'THE OTHER IS A GOOD THREE POUND HEAVIER SAID SHE 'AND WE
FATTENED IT EXPRESSLY FOR YOU
'NEVER MIND
I'LL HAVE THE OTHER AND I'LL TAKE IT NOW SAID I
'OH JUST AS YOU LIKE SAID SHE A LITTLE HUFFED
'WHICH IS IT
YOU WANT THEN
'THAT WHITE ONE WITH THE BARRED TAIL RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
FLOCK
'OH VERY WELL
KILL IT AND TAKE IT WITH YOU
WELL I DID WHAT SHE SAID MR
HOLMES AND I CARRIED THE BIRD
ALL THE WAY TO KILBURN
I TOLD MY PAL WHAT I HAD DONE FOR HE WAS
A MAN THAT IT WAS EASY TO TELL A THING LIKE THAT TO
HE LAUGHED
UNTIL HE CHOKED AND WE GOT A KNIFE AND OPENED THE GOOSE
MY
HEART TURNED TO WATER FOR THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE STONE AND I
KNEW THAT SOME TERRIBLE MISTAKE HAD OCCURRED
I LEFT THE BIRD
RUSHED BACK TO MY SISTER'S AND HURRIED INTO THE BACK YARD
THERE
WAS NOT A BIRD TO BE SEEN THERE
'WHERE ARE THEY ALL MAGGIE I CRIED
'GONE TO THE DEALER'S JEM
'WHICH DEALER'S
'BRECKINRIDGE OF COVENT GARDEN
'BUT WAS THERE ANOTHER WITH A BARRED TAIL I ASKED 'THE SAME
AS THE ONE I CHOSE
'YES JEM THERE WERE TWO BARRED TAILED ONES AND I COULD NEVER
TELL THEM APART
WELL THEN OF COURSE I SAW IT ALL AND I RAN OFF AS HARD AS MY
FEET WOULD CARRY ME TO THIS MAN BRECKINRIDGE BUT HE HAD SOLD THE
LOT AT ONCE AND NOT ONE WORD WOULD HE TELL ME AS TO WHERE THEY
HAD GONE
YOU HEARD HIM YOURSELVES TO NIGHT
WELL HE HAS ALWAYS
ANSWERED ME LIKE THAT
MY SISTER THINKS THAT I AM GOING MAD
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT I AM MYSELF
AND NOW AND NOW I AM MYSELF
A BRANDED THIEF WITHOUT EVER HAVING TOUCHED THE WEALTH FOR WHICH
I SOLD MY CHARACTER
GOD HELP ME GOD HELP ME HE BURST INTO
CONVULSIVE SOBBING WITH HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY HIS HEAVY BREATHING AND
BY THE MEASURED TAPPING OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' FINGER TIPS UPON THE
EDGE OF THE TABLE
THEN MY FRIEND ROSE AND THREW OPEN THE DOOR
GET OUT SAID HE
WHAT SIR OH HEAVEN BLESS YOU
NO MORE WORDS
GET OUT
AND NO MORE WORDS WERE NEEDED
THERE WAS A RUSH A CLATTER UPON
THE STAIRS THE BANG OF A DOOR AND THE CRISP RATTLE OF RUNNING
FOOTFALLS FROM THE STREET
AFTER ALL WATSON SAID HOLMES REACHING UP HIS HAND FOR HIS
CLAY PIPE I AM NOT RETAINED BY THE POLICE TO SUPPLY THEIR
DEFICIENCIES
IF HORNER WERE IN DANGER IT WOULD BE ANOTHER THING
BUT THIS FELLOW WILL NOT APPEAR AGAINST HIM AND THE CASE MUST
COLLAPSE
I SUPPOSE THAT I AM COMMUTING A FELONY BUT IT IS JUST
POSSIBLE THAT I AM SAVING A SOUL
THIS FELLOW WILL NOT GO WRONG
AGAIN HE IS TOO TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
SEND HIM TO GAOL NOW AND
YOU MAKE HIM A GAOL BIRD FOR LIFE
BESIDES IT IS THE SEASON OF
FORGIVENESS
CHANCE HAS PUT IN OUR WAY A MOST SINGULAR AND
WHIMSICAL PROBLEM AND ITS SOLUTION IS ITS OWN REWARD
IF YOU
WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TOUCH THE BELL DOCTOR WE WILL BEGIN
ANOTHER INVESTIGATION IN WHICH ALSO A BIRD WILL BE THE CHIEF
FEATURE
VIII
THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
ON GLANCING OVER MY NOTES OF THE SEVENTY ODD CASES IN WHICH I
HAVE DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS STUDIED THE METHODS OF MY FRIEND
SHERLOCK HOLMES I FIND MANY TRAGIC SOME COMIC A LARGE NUMBER
MERELY STRANGE BUT NONE COMMONPLACE FOR WORKING AS HE DID
RATHER FOR THE LOVE OF HIS ART THAN FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF
WEALTH HE REFUSED TO ASSOCIATE HIMSELF WITH ANY INVESTIGATION
WHICH DID NOT TEND TOWARDS THE UNUSUAL AND EVEN THE FANTASTIC
OF ALL THESE VARIED CASES HOWEVER I CANNOT RECALL ANY WHICH
PRESENTED MORE SINGULAR FEATURES THAN THAT WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE WELL KNOWN SURREY FAMILY OF THE ROYLOTTS OF STOKE MORAN
THE EVENTS IN QUESTION OCCURRED IN THE EARLY DAYS OF MY
ASSOCIATION WITH HOLMES WHEN WE WERE SHARING ROOMS AS BACHELORS
IN BAKER STREET
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE PLACED THEM
UPON RECORD BEFORE BUT A PROMISE OF SECRECY WAS MADE AT THE
TIME FROM WHICH I HAVE ONLY BEEN FREED DURING THE LAST MONTH BY
THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF THE LADY TO WHOM THE PLEDGE WAS GIVEN
IT
IS PERHAPS AS WELL THAT THE FACTS SHOULD NOW COME TO LIGHT FOR I
HAVE REASONS TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE WIDESPREAD RUMOURS AS TO THE
DEATH OF DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT WHICH TEND TO MAKE THE MATTER EVEN
MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE TRUTH
IT WAS EARLY IN APRIL IN THE YEAR '83 THAT I WOKE ONE MORNING TO
FIND SHERLOCK HOLMES STANDING FULLY DRESSED BY THE SIDE OF MY
BED
HE WAS A LATE RISER AS A RULE AND AS THE CLOCK ON THE
MANTELPIECE SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS ONLY A QUARTER PAST SEVEN I
BLINKED UP AT HIM IN SOME SURPRISE AND PERHAPS JUST A LITTLE
RESENTMENT FOR I WAS MYSELF REGULAR IN MY HABITS
VERY SORRY TO KNOCK YOU UP WATSON SAID HE BUT IT'S THE
COMMON LOT THIS MORNING
MRS
HUDSON HAS BEEN KNOCKED UP SHE
RETORTED UPON ME AND I ON YOU
WHAT IS IT THEN A FIRE
NO A CLIENT
IT SEEMS THAT A YOUNG LADY HAS ARRIVED IN A
CONSIDERABLE STATE OF EXCITEMENT WHO INSISTS UPON SEEING ME
SHE
IS WAITING NOW IN THE SITTING ROOM
NOW WHEN YOUNG LADIES WANDER
ABOUT THE METROPOLIS AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING AND KNOCK
SLEEPY PEOPLE UP OUT OF THEIR BEDS I PRESUME THAT IT IS
SOMETHING VERY PRESSING WHICH THEY HAVE TO COMMUNICATE
SHOULD IT
PROVE TO BE AN INTERESTING CASE YOU WOULD I AM SURE WISH TO
FOLLOW IT FROM THE OUTSET
I THOUGHT AT ANY RATE THAT I SHOULD
CALL YOU AND GIVE YOU THE CHANCE
MY DEAR FELLOW I WOULD NOT MISS IT FOR ANYTHING
I HAD NO KEENER PLEASURE THAN IN FOLLOWING HOLMES IN HIS
PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND IN ADMIRING THE RAPID
DEDUCTIONS AS SWIFT AS INTUITIONS AND YET ALWAYS FOUNDED ON A
LOGICAL BASIS WITH WHICH HE UNRAVELLED THE PROBLEMS WHICH WERE
SUBMITTED TO HIM
I RAPIDLY THREW ON MY CLOTHES AND WAS READY IN
A FEW MINUTES TO ACCOMPANY MY FRIEND DOWN TO THE SITTING ROOM
A
LADY DRESSED IN BLACK AND HEAVILY VEILED WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN
THE WINDOW ROSE AS WE ENTERED
GOOD MORNING MADAM SAID HOLMES CHEERILY
MY NAME IS SHERLOCK
HOLMES
THIS IS MY INTIMATE FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE DR
WATSON
BEFORE WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK AS FREELY AS BEFORE MYSELF
HA I AM
GLAD TO SEE THAT MRS
HUDSON HAS HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO LIGHT THE
FIRE
PRAY DRAW UP TO IT AND I SHALL ORDER YOU A CUP OF HOT
COFFEE FOR I OBSERVE THAT YOU ARE SHIVERING
IT IS NOT COLD WHICH MAKES ME SHIVER SAID THE WOMAN IN A LOW
VOICE CHANGING HER SEAT AS REQUESTED
WHAT THEN
IT IS FEAR MR
HOLMES
IT IS TERROR SHE RAISED HER VEIL AS
SHE SPOKE AND WE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS INDEED IN A PITIABLE
STATE OF AGITATION HER FACE ALL DRAWN AND GREY WITH RESTLESS
FRIGHTENED EYES LIKE THOSE OF SOME HUNTED ANIMAL
HER FEATURES
AND FIGURE WERE THOSE OF A WOMAN OF THIRTY BUT HER HAIR WAS SHOT
WITH PREMATURE GREY AND HER EXPRESSION WAS WEARY AND HAGGARD
SHERLOCK HOLMES RAN HER OVER WITH ONE OF HIS QUICK
ALL COMPREHENSIVE GLANCES
YOU MUST NOT FEAR SAID HE SOOTHINGLY BENDING FORWARD AND
PATTING HER FOREARM
WE SHALL SOON SET MATTERS RIGHT I HAVE NO
DOUBT
YOU HAVE COME IN BY TRAIN THIS MORNING I SEE
YOU KNOW ME THEN
NO BUT I OBSERVE THE SECOND HALF OF A RETURN TICKET IN THE PALM
OF YOUR LEFT GLOVE
YOU MUST HAVE STARTED EARLY AND YET YOU HAD
A GOOD DRIVE IN A DOG CART ALONG HEAVY ROADS BEFORE YOU REACHED
THE STATION
THE LADY GAVE A VIOLENT START AND STARED IN BEWILDERMENT AT MY
COMPANION
THERE IS NO MYSTERY MY DEAR MADAM SAID HE SMILING
THE LEFT
ARM OF YOUR JACKET IS SPATTERED WITH MUD IN NO LESS THAN SEVEN
PLACES
THE MARKS ARE PERFECTLY FRESH
THERE IS NO VEHICLE SAVE A
DOG CART WHICH THROWS UP MUD IN THAT WAY AND THEN ONLY WHEN YOU
SIT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE DRIVER
WHATEVER YOUR REASONS MAY BE YOU ARE PERFECTLY CORRECT SAID
SHE
I STARTED FROM HOME BEFORE SIX REACHED LEATHERHEAD AT
TWENTY PAST AND CAME IN BY THE FIRST TRAIN TO WATERLOO
SIR I
CAN STAND THIS STRAIN NO LONGER I SHALL GO MAD IF IT CONTINUES
I HAVE NO ONE TO TURN TO NONE SAVE ONLY ONE WHO CARES FOR ME
AND HE POOR FELLOW CAN BE OF LITTLE AID
I HAVE HEARD OF YOU
MR
HOLMES I HAVE HEARD OF YOU FROM MRS
FARINTOSH WHOM YOU
HELPED IN THE HOUR OF HER SORE NEED
IT WAS FROM HER THAT I HAD
YOUR ADDRESS
OH SIR DO YOU NOT THINK THAT YOU COULD HELP ME
TOO AND AT LEAST THROW A LITTLE LIGHT THROUGH THE DENSE DARKNESS
WHICH SURROUNDS ME AT PRESENT IT IS OUT OF MY POWER TO REWARD
YOU FOR YOUR SERVICES BUT IN A MONTH OR SIX WEEKS I SHALL BE
MARRIED WITH THE CONTROL OF MY OWN INCOME AND THEN AT LEAST YOU
SHALL NOT FIND ME UNGRATEFUL
HOLMES TURNED TO HIS DESK AND UNLOCKING IT DREW OUT A SMALL
CASE BOOK WHICH HE CONSULTED
FARINTOSH SAID HE
AH YES I RECALL THE CASE IT WAS
CONCERNED WITH AN OPAL TIARA
I THINK IT WAS BEFORE YOUR TIME
WATSON
I CAN ONLY SAY MADAM THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO DEVOTE
THE SAME CARE TO YOUR CASE AS I DID TO THAT OF YOUR FRIEND
AS TO
REWARD MY PROFESSION IS ITS OWN REWARD BUT YOU ARE AT LIBERTY
TO DEFRAY WHATEVER EXPENSES I MAY BE PUT TO AT THE TIME WHICH
SUITS YOU BEST
AND NOW I BEG THAT YOU WILL LAY BEFORE US
EVERYTHING THAT MAY HELP US IN FORMING AN OPINION UPON THE
MATTER
ALAS REPLIED OUR VISITOR THE VERY HORROR OF MY SITUATION
LIES IN THE FACT THAT MY FEARS ARE SO VAGUE AND MY SUSPICIONS
DEPEND SO ENTIRELY UPON SMALL POINTS WHICH MIGHT SEEM TRIVIAL TO
ANOTHER THAT EVEN HE TO WHOM OF ALL OTHERS I HAVE A RIGHT TO
LOOK FOR HELP AND ADVICE LOOKS UPON ALL THAT I TELL HIM ABOUT IT
AS THE FANCIES OF A NERVOUS WOMAN
HE DOES NOT SAY SO BUT I CAN
READ IT FROM HIS SOOTHING ANSWERS AND AVERTED EYES
BUT I HAVE
HEARD MR
HOLMES THAT YOU CAN SEE DEEPLY INTO THE MANIFOLD
WICKEDNESS OF THE HUMAN HEART
YOU MAY ADVISE ME HOW TO WALK AMID
THE DANGERS WHICH ENCOMPASS ME
I AM ALL ATTENTION MADAM
MY NAME IS HELEN STONER AND I AM LIVING WITH MY STEPFATHER WHO
IS THE LAST SURVIVOR OF ONE OF THE OLDEST SAXON FAMILIES IN
ENGLAND THE ROYLOTTS OF STOKE MORAN ON THE WESTERN BORDER OF
SURREY
HOLMES NODDED HIS HEAD
THE NAME IS FAMILIAR TO ME SAID HE
THE FAMILY WAS AT ONE TIME AMONG THE RICHEST IN ENGLAND AND THE
ESTATES EXTENDED OVER THE BORDERS INTO BERKSHIRE IN THE NORTH
AND HAMPSHIRE IN THE WEST
IN THE LAST CENTURY HOWEVER FOUR
SUCCESSIVE HEIRS WERE OF A DISSOLUTE AND WASTEFUL DISPOSITION
AND THE FAMILY RUIN WAS EVENTUALLY COMPLETED BY A GAMBLER IN THE
DAYS OF THE REGENCY
NOTHING WAS LEFT SAVE A FEW ACRES OF GROUND
AND THE TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD HOUSE WHICH IS ITSELF CRUSHED UNDER
A HEAVY MORTGAGE
THE LAST SQUIRE DRAGGED OUT HIS EXISTENCE
THERE LIVING THE HORRIBLE LIFE OF AN ARISTOCRATIC PAUPER BUT
HIS ONLY SON MY STEPFATHER SEEING THAT HE MUST ADAPT HIMSELF TO
THE NEW CONDITIONS OBTAINED AN ADVANCE FROM A RELATIVE WHICH
ENABLED HIM TO TAKE A MEDICAL DEGREE AND WENT OUT TO CALCUTTA
WHERE BY HIS PROFESSIONAL SKILL AND HIS FORCE OF CHARACTER HE
ESTABLISHED A LARGE PRACTICE
IN A FIT OF ANGER HOWEVER CAUSED
BY SOME ROBBERIES WHICH HAD BEEN PERPETRATED IN THE HOUSE HE
BEAT HIS NATIVE BUTLER TO DEATH AND NARROWLY ESCAPED A CAPITAL
SENTENCE
AS IT WAS HE SUFFERED A LONG TERM OF IMPRISONMENT AND
AFTERWARDS RETURNED TO ENGLAND A MOROSE AND DISAPPOINTED MAN
WHEN DR
ROYLOTT WAS IN INDIA HE MARRIED MY MOTHER MRS
STONER
THE YOUNG WIDOW OF MAJOR GENERAL STONER OF THE BENGAL ARTILLERY
MY SISTER JULIA AND I WERE TWINS AND WE WERE ONLY TWO YEARS OLD
AT THE TIME OF MY MOTHER'S RE MARRIAGE
SHE HAD A CONSIDERABLE
SUM OF MONEY NOT LESS THAN 1000 POUNDS A YEAR AND THIS SHE
BEQUEATHED TO DR
ROYLOTT ENTIRELY WHILE WE RESIDED WITH HIM
WITH A PROVISION THAT A CERTAIN ANNUAL SUM SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
EACH OF US IN THE EVENT OF OUR MARRIAGE
SHORTLY AFTER OUR RETURN
TO ENGLAND MY MOTHER DIED SHE WAS KILLED EIGHT YEARS AGO IN A
RAILWAY ACCIDENT NEAR CREWE
DR
ROYLOTT THEN ABANDONED HIS
ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN PRACTICE IN LONDON AND TOOK US
TO LIVE WITH HIM IN THE OLD ANCESTRAL HOUSE AT STOKE MORAN
THE
MONEY WHICH MY MOTHER HAD LEFT WAS ENOUGH FOR ALL OUR WANTS AND
THERE SEEMED TO BE NO OBSTACLE TO OUR HAPPINESS
BUT A TERRIBLE CHANGE CAME OVER OUR STEPFATHER ABOUT THIS TIME
INSTEAD OF MAKING FRIENDS AND EXCHANGING VISITS WITH OUR
NEIGHBOURS WHO HAD AT FIRST BEEN OVERJOYED TO SEE A ROYLOTT OF
STOKE MORAN BACK IN THE OLD FAMILY SEAT HE SHUT HIMSELF UP IN
HIS HOUSE AND SELDOM CAME OUT SAVE TO INDULGE IN FEROCIOUS
QUARRELS WITH WHOEVER MIGHT CROSS HIS PATH
VIOLENCE OF TEMPER
APPROACHING TO MANIA HAS BEEN HEREDITARY IN THE MEN OF THE
FAMILY AND IN MY STEPFATHER'S CASE IT HAD I BELIEVE BEEN
INTENSIFIED BY HIS LONG RESIDENCE IN THE TROPICS
A SERIES OF
DISGRACEFUL BRAWLS TOOK PLACE TWO OF WHICH ENDED IN THE
POLICE COURT UNTIL AT LAST HE BECAME THE TERROR OF THE VILLAGE
AND THE FOLKS WOULD FLY AT HIS APPROACH FOR HE IS A MAN OF
IMMENSE STRENGTH AND ABSOLUTELY UNCONTROLLABLE IN HIS ANGER
LAST WEEK HE HURLED THE LOCAL BLACKSMITH OVER A PARAPET INTO A
STREAM AND IT WAS ONLY BY PAYING OVER ALL THE MONEY WHICH I
COULD GATHER TOGETHER THAT I WAS ABLE TO AVERT ANOTHER PUBLIC
EXPOSURE
HE HAD NO FRIENDS AT ALL SAVE THE WANDERING GIPSIES
AND HE WOULD GIVE THESE VAGABONDS LEAVE TO ENCAMP UPON THE FEW
ACRES OF BRAMBLE COVERED LAND WHICH REPRESENT THE FAMILY ESTATE
AND WOULD ACCEPT IN RETURN THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR TENTS
WANDERING AWAY WITH THEM SOMETIMES FOR WEEKS ON END
HE HAS A
PASSION ALSO FOR INDIAN ANIMALS WHICH ARE SENT OVER TO HIM BY A
CORRESPONDENT AND HE HAS AT THIS MOMENT A CHEETAH AND A BABOON
WHICH WANDER FREELY OVER HIS GROUNDS AND ARE FEARED BY THE
VILLAGERS ALMOST AS MUCH AS THEIR MASTER
YOU CAN IMAGINE FROM WHAT I SAY THAT MY POOR SISTER JULIA AND I
HAD NO GREAT PLEASURE IN OUR LIVES
NO SERVANT WOULD STAY WITH
US AND FOR A LONG TIME WE DID ALL THE WORK OF THE HOUSE
SHE WAS
BUT THIRTY AT THE TIME OF HER DEATH AND YET HER HAIR HAD ALREADY
BEGUN TO WHITEN EVEN AS MINE HAS
YOUR SISTER IS DEAD THEN
SHE DIED JUST TWO YEARS AGO AND IT IS OF HER DEATH THAT I WISH
TO SPEAK TO YOU
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT LIVING THE LIFE WHICH I
HAVE DESCRIBED WE WERE LITTLE LIKELY TO SEE ANYONE OF OUR OWN
AGE AND POSITION
WE HAD HOWEVER AN AUNT MY MOTHER'S MAIDEN
SISTER MISS HONORIA WESTPHAIL WHO LIVES NEAR HARROW AND WE
WERE OCCASIONALLY ALLOWED TO PAY SHORT VISITS AT THIS LADY'S
HOUSE
JULIA WENT THERE AT CHRISTMAS TWO YEARS AGO AND MET THERE
A HALF PAY MAJOR OF MARINES TO WHOM SHE BECAME ENGAGED
MY
STEPFATHER LEARNED OF THE ENGAGEMENT WHEN MY SISTER RETURNED AND
OFFERED NO OBJECTION TO THE MARRIAGE BUT WITHIN A FORTNIGHT OF
THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE WEDDING THE TERRIBLE EVENT
OCCURRED WHICH HAS DEPRIVED ME OF MY ONLY COMPANION
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS EYES
CLOSED AND HIS HEAD SUNK IN A CUSHION BUT HE HALF OPENED HIS
LIDS NOW AND GLANCED ACROSS AT HIS VISITOR
PRAY BE PRECISE AS TO DETAILS SAID HE
IT IS EASY FOR ME TO BE SO FOR EVERY EVENT OF THAT DREADFUL
TIME IS SEARED INTO MY MEMORY
THE MANOR HOUSE IS AS I HAVE
ALREADY SAID VERY OLD AND ONLY ONE WING IS NOW INHABITED
THE
BEDROOMS IN THIS WING ARE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE SITTING ROOMS
BEING IN THE CENTRAL BLOCK OF THE BUILDINGS
OF THESE BEDROOMS
THE FIRST IS DR
ROYLOTT'S THE SECOND MY SISTER'S AND THE THIRD
MY OWN
THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM BUT THEY ALL OPEN
OUT INTO THE SAME CORRIDOR
DO I MAKE MYSELF PLAIN
PERFECTLY SO
THE WINDOWS OF THE THREE ROOMS OPEN OUT UPON THE LAWN
THAT
FATAL NIGHT DR
ROYLOTT HAD GONE TO HIS ROOM EARLY THOUGH WE
KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT RETIRED TO REST FOR MY SISTER WAS TROUBLED
BY THE SMELL OF THE STRONG INDIAN CIGARS WHICH IT WAS HIS CUSTOM
TO SMOKE
SHE LEFT HER ROOM THEREFORE AND CAME INTO MINE WHERE
SHE SAT FOR SOME TIME CHATTING ABOUT HER APPROACHING WEDDING
AT
ELEVEN O'CLOCK SHE ROSE TO LEAVE ME BUT SHE PAUSED AT THE DOOR
AND LOOKED BACK
'TELL ME HELEN SAID SHE 'HAVE YOU EVER HEARD ANYONE WHISTLE
IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT
'NEVER SAID I
'I SUPPOSE THAT YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY WHISTLE YOURSELF IN
YOUR SLEEP
'CERTAINLY NOT
BUT WHY
'BECAUSE DURING THE LAST FEW NIGHTS I HAVE ALWAYS ABOUT THREE
IN THE MORNING HEARD A LOW CLEAR WHISTLE
I AM A LIGHT SLEEPER
AND IT HAS AWAKENED ME
I CANNOT TELL WHERE IT CAME FROM PERHAPS
FROM THE NEXT ROOM PERHAPS FROM THE LAWN
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD
JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU HAD HEARD IT
'NO I HAVE NOT
IT MUST BE THOSE WRETCHED GIPSIES IN THE
PLANTATION
'VERY LIKELY
AND YET IF IT WERE ON THE LAWN I WONDER THAT YOU
DID NOT HEAR IT ALSO
'AH BUT I SLEEP MORE HEAVILY THAN YOU
'WELL IT IS OF NO GREAT CONSEQUENCE AT ANY RATE SHE SMILED
BACK AT ME CLOSED MY DOOR AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HER
KEY TURN IN THE LOCK
INDEED SAID HOLMES
WAS IT YOUR CUSTOM ALWAYS TO LOCK
YOURSELVES IN AT NIGHT
ALWAYS
AND WHY
I THINK THAT I MENTIONED TO YOU THAT THE DOCTOR KEPT A CHEETAH
AND A BABOON
WE HAD NO FEELING OF SECURITY UNLESS OUR DOORS WERE
LOCKED
QUITE SO
PRAY PROCEED WITH YOUR STATEMENT
I COULD NOT SLEEP THAT NIGHT
A VAGUE FEELING OF IMPENDING
MISFORTUNE IMPRESSED ME
MY SISTER AND I YOU WILL RECOLLECT
WERE TWINS AND YOU KNOW HOW SUBTLE ARE THE LINKS WHICH BIND TWO
SOULS WHICH ARE SO CLOSELY ALLIED
IT WAS A WILD NIGHT
THE WIND
WAS HOWLING OUTSIDE AND THE RAIN WAS BEATING AND SPLASHING
AGAINST THE WINDOWS
SUDDENLY AMID ALL THE HUBBUB OF THE GALE
THERE BURST FORTH THE WILD SCREAM OF A TERRIFIED WOMAN
I KNEW
THAT IT WAS MY SISTER'S VOICE
I SPRANG FROM MY BED WRAPPED A
SHAWL ROUND ME AND RUSHED INTO THE CORRIDOR
AS I OPENED MY DOOR
I SEEMED TO HEAR A LOW WHISTLE SUCH AS MY SISTER DESCRIBED AND
A FEW MOMENTS LATER A CLANGING SOUND AS IF A MASS OF METAL HAD
FALLEN
AS I RAN DOWN THE PASSAGE MY SISTER'S DOOR WAS UNLOCKED
AND REVOLVED SLOWLY UPON ITS HINGES
I STARED AT IT
HORROR STRICKEN NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS ABOUT TO ISSUE FROM IT
BY
THE LIGHT OF THE CORRIDOR LAMP I SAW MY SISTER APPEAR AT THE
OPENING HER FACE BLANCHED WITH TERROR HER HANDS GROPING FOR
HELP HER WHOLE FIGURE SWAYING TO AND FRO LIKE THAT OF A
DRUNKARD
I RAN TO HER AND THREW MY ARMS ROUND HER BUT AT THAT
MOMENT HER KNEES SEEMED TO GIVE WAY AND SHE FELL TO THE GROUND
SHE WRITHED AS ONE WHO IS IN TERRIBLE PAIN AND HER LIMBS WERE
DREADFULLY CONVULSED
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD NOT
RECOGNISED ME BUT AS I BENT OVER HER SHE SUDDENLY SHRIEKED OUT
IN A VOICE WHICH I SHALL NEVER FORGET 'OH MY GOD HELEN IT WAS
THE BAND THE SPECKLED BAND THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE WHICH SHE
WOULD FAIN HAVE SAID AND SHE STABBED WITH HER FINGER INTO THE
AIR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DOCTOR'S ROOM BUT A FRESH CONVULSION
SEIZED HER AND CHOKED HER WORDS
I RUSHED OUT CALLING LOUDLY FOR
MY STEPFATHER AND I MET HIM HASTENING FROM HIS ROOM IN HIS
DRESSING GOWN
WHEN HE REACHED MY SISTER'S SIDE SHE WAS
UNCONSCIOUS AND THOUGH HE POURED BRANDY DOWN HER THROAT AND SENT
FOR MEDICAL AID FROM THE VILLAGE ALL EFFORTS WERE IN VAIN FOR
SHE SLOWLY SANK AND DIED WITHOUT HAVING RECOVERED HER
CONSCIOUSNESS
SUCH WAS THE DREADFUL END OF MY BELOVED SISTER
ONE MOMENT SAID HOLMES ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS WHISTLE AND
METALLIC SOUND COULD YOU SWEAR TO IT
THAT WAS WHAT THE COUNTY CORONER ASKED ME AT THE INQUIRY
IT IS
MY STRONG IMPRESSION THAT I HEARD IT AND YET AMONG THE CRASH OF
THE GALE AND THE CREAKING OF AN OLD HOUSE I MAY POSSIBLY HAVE
BEEN DECEIVED
WAS YOUR SISTER DRESSED
NO SHE WAS IN HER NIGHT DRESS
IN HER RIGHT HAND WAS FOUND THE
CHARRED STUMP OF A MATCH AND IN HER LEFT A MATCH BOX
SHOWING THAT SHE HAD STRUCK A LIGHT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER WHEN
THE ALARM TOOK PLACE
THAT IS IMPORTANT
AND WHAT CONCLUSIONS DID
THE CORONER COME TO
HE INVESTIGATED THE CASE WITH GREAT CARE FOR DR
ROYLOTT'S
CONDUCT HAD LONG BEEN NOTORIOUS IN THE COUNTY BUT HE WAS UNABLE
TO FIND ANY SATISFACTORY CAUSE OF DEATH
MY EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT
THE DOOR HAD BEEN FASTENED UPON THE INNER SIDE AND THE WINDOWS
WERE BLOCKED BY OLD FASHIONED SHUTTERS WITH BROAD IRON BARS
WHICH WERE SECURED EVERY NIGHT
THE WALLS WERE CAREFULLY SOUNDED
AND WERE SHOWN TO BE QUITE SOLID ALL ROUND AND THE FLOORING WAS
ALSO THOROUGHLY EXAMINED WITH THE SAME RESULT
THE CHIMNEY IS
WIDE BUT IS BARRED UP BY FOUR LARGE STAPLES
IT IS CERTAIN
THEREFORE THAT MY SISTER WAS QUITE ALONE WHEN SHE MET HER END
BESIDES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF ANY VIOLENCE UPON HER
HOW ABOUT POISON
THE DOCTORS EXAMINED HER FOR IT BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THIS UNFORTUNATE LADY DIED OF THEN
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT SHE DIED OF PURE FEAR AND NERVOUS SHOCK
THOUGH WHAT IT WAS THAT FRIGHTENED HER I CANNOT IMAGINE
WERE THERE GIPSIES IN THE PLANTATION AT THE TIME
YES THERE ARE NEARLY ALWAYS SOME THERE
AH AND WHAT DID YOU GATHER FROM THIS ALLUSION TO A BAND A
SPECKLED BAND
SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS MERELY THE WILD TALK OF
DELIRIUM SOMETIMES THAT IT MAY HAVE REFERRED TO SOME BAND OF
PEOPLE PERHAPS TO THESE VERY GIPSIES IN THE PLANTATION
I DO NOT
KNOW WHETHER THE SPOTTED HANDKERCHIEFS WHICH SO MANY OF THEM WEAR
OVER THEIR HEADS MIGHT HAVE SUGGESTED THE STRANGE ADJECTIVE WHICH
SHE USED
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD LIKE A MAN WHO IS FAR FROM BEING SATISFIED
THESE ARE VERY DEEP WATERS SAID HE PRAY GO ON WITH YOUR
NARRATIVE
TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN AND MY LIFE HAS BEEN UNTIL
LATELY LONELIER THAN EVER
A MONTH AGO HOWEVER A DEAR FRIEND
WHOM I HAVE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR TO ASK
MY HAND IN MARRIAGE
HIS NAME IS ARMITAGE PERCY ARMITAGE THE
SECOND SON OF MR
ARMITAGE OF CRANE WATER NEAR READING
MY
STEPFATHER HAS OFFERED NO OPPOSITION TO THE MATCH AND WE ARE TO
BE MARRIED IN THE COURSE OF THE SPRING
TWO DAYS AGO SOME REPAIRS
WERE STARTED IN THE WEST WING OF THE BUILDING AND MY BEDROOM
WALL HAS BEEN PIERCED SO THAT I HAVE HAD TO MOVE INTO THE
CHAMBER IN WHICH MY SISTER DIED AND TO SLEEP IN THE VERY BED IN
WHICH SHE SLEPT
IMAGINE THEN MY THRILL OF TERROR WHEN LAST
NIGHT AS I LAY AWAKE THINKING OVER HER TERRIBLE FATE I
SUDDENLY HEARD IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT THE LOW WHISTLE WHICH
HAD BEEN THE HERALD OF HER OWN DEATH
I SPRANG UP AND LIT THE
LAMP BUT NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE ROOM
I WAS TOO SHAKEN TO
GO TO BED AGAIN HOWEVER SO I DRESSED AND AS SOON AS IT WAS
DAYLIGHT I SLIPPED DOWN GOT A DOG CART AT THE CROWN INN WHICH
IS OPPOSITE AND DROVE TO LEATHERHEAD FROM WHENCE I HAVE COME ON
THIS MORNING WITH THE ONE OBJECT OF SEEING YOU AND ASKING YOUR
ADVICE
YOU HAVE DONE WISELY SAID MY FRIEND
BUT HAVE YOU TOLD ME
ALL
YES ALL
MISS ROYLOTT YOU HAVE NOT
YOU ARE SCREENING YOUR STEPFATHER
WHY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
FOR ANSWER HOLMES PUSHED BACK THE FRILL OF BLACK LACE WHICH
FRINGED THE HAND THAT LAY UPON OUR VISITOR'S KNEE
FIVE LITTLE
LIVID SPOTS THE MARKS OF FOUR FINGERS AND A THUMB WERE PRINTED
UPON THE WHITE WRIST
YOU HAVE BEEN CRUELLY USED SAID HOLMES
THE LADY COLOURED DEEPLY AND COVERED OVER HER INJURED WRIST
HE
IS A HARD MAN SHE SAID AND PERHAPS HE HARDLY KNOWS HIS OWN
STRENGTH
THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE DURING WHICH HOLMES LEANED HIS CHIN
UPON HIS HANDS AND STARED INTO THE CRACKLING FIRE
THIS IS A VERY DEEP BUSINESS HE SAID AT LAST
THERE ARE A
THOUSAND DETAILS WHICH I SHOULD DESIRE TO KNOW BEFORE I DECIDE
UPON OUR COURSE OF ACTION
YET WE HAVE NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE
IF
WE WERE TO COME TO STOKE MORAN TO DAY WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR
US TO SEE OVER THESE ROOMS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR
STEPFATHER
AS IT HAPPENS HE SPOKE OF COMING INTO TOWN TO DAY UPON SOME
MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE WILL BE AWAY ALL
DAY AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO DISTURB YOU
WE HAVE A
HOUSEKEEPER NOW BUT SHE IS OLD AND FOOLISH AND I COULD EASILY
GET HER OUT OF THE WAY
EXCELLENT
YOU ARE NOT AVERSE TO THIS TRIP WATSON
BY NO MEANS
THEN WE SHALL BOTH COME
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO YOURSELF
I HAVE ONE OR TWO THINGS WHICH I WOULD WISH TO DO NOW THAT I AM
IN TOWN
BUT I SHALL RETURN BY THE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN SO AS TO
BE THERE IN TIME FOR YOUR COMING
AND YOU MAY EXPECT US EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
I HAVE MYSELF SOME
SMALL BUSINESS MATTERS TO ATTEND TO
WILL YOU NOT WAIT AND
BREAKFAST
NO I MUST GO
MY HEART IS LIGHTENED ALREADY SINCE I HAVE
CONFIDED MY TROUBLE TO YOU
I SHALL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU
AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON SHE DROPPED HER THICK BLACK VEIL OVER HER
FACE AND GLIDED FROM THE ROOM
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL WATSON ASKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A MOST DARK AND SINISTER BUSINESS
DARK ENOUGH AND SINISTER ENOUGH
YET IF THE LADY IS CORRECT IN SAYING THAT THE FLOORING AND WALLS
ARE SOUND AND THAT THE DOOR WINDOW AND CHIMNEY ARE IMPASSABLE
THEN HER SISTER MUST HAVE BEEN UNDOUBTEDLY ALONE WHEN SHE MET HER
MYSTERIOUS END
WHAT BECOMES THEN OF THESE NOCTURNAL WHISTLES AND WHAT OF THE
VERY PECULIAR WORDS OF THE DYING WOMAN
I CANNOT THINK
WHEN YOU COMBINE THE IDEAS OF WHISTLES AT NIGHT THE PRESENCE OF
A BAND OF GIPSIES WHO ARE ON INTIMATE TERMS WITH THIS OLD DOCTOR
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE DOCTOR HAS
AN INTEREST IN PREVENTING HIS STEPDAUGHTER'S MARRIAGE THE DYING
ALLUSION TO A BAND AND FINALLY THE FACT THAT MISS HELEN STONER
HEARD A METALLIC CLANG WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY ONE OF
THOSE METAL BARS THAT SECURED THE SHUTTERS FALLING BACK INTO ITS
PLACE I THINK THAT THERE IS GOOD GROUND TO THINK THAT THE
MYSTERY MAY BE CLEARED ALONG THOSE LINES
BUT WHAT THEN DID THE GIPSIES DO
I CANNOT IMAGINE
I SEE MANY OBJECTIONS TO ANY SUCH THEORY
AND SO DO I
IT IS PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON THAT WE ARE GOING
TO STOKE MORAN THIS DAY
I WANT TO SEE WHETHER THE OBJECTIONS ARE
FATAL OR IF THEY MAY BE EXPLAINED AWAY
BUT WHAT IN THE NAME OF
THE DEVIL
THE EJACULATION HAD BEEN DRAWN FROM MY COMPANION BY THE FACT THAT
OUR DOOR HAD BEEN SUDDENLY DASHED OPEN AND THAT A HUGE MAN HAD
FRAMED HIMSELF IN THE APERTURE
HIS COSTUME WAS A PECULIAR
MIXTURE OF THE PROFESSIONAL AND OF THE AGRICULTURAL HAVING A
BLACK TOP HAT A LONG FROCK COAT AND A PAIR OF HIGH GAITERS
WITH A HUNTING CROP SWINGING IN HIS HAND
SO TALL WAS HE THAT HIS
HAT ACTUALLY BRUSHED THE CROSS BAR OF THE DOORWAY AND HIS
BREADTH SEEMED TO SPAN IT ACROSS FROM SIDE TO SIDE
A LARGE FACE
SEARED WITH A THOUSAND WRINKLES BURNED YELLOW WITH THE SUN AND
MARKED WITH EVERY EVIL PASSION WAS TURNED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER
OF US WHILE HIS DEEP SET BILE SHOT EYES AND HIS HIGH THIN
FLESHLESS NOSE GAVE HIM SOMEWHAT THE RESEMBLANCE TO A FIERCE OLD
BIRD OF PREY
WHICH OF YOU IS HOLMES ASKED THIS APPARITION
MY NAME SIR BUT YOU HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF ME SAID MY
COMPANION QUIETLY
I AM DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT OF STOKE MORAN
INDEED DOCTOR SAID HOLMES BLANDLY
PRAY TAKE A SEAT
I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND
MY STEPDAUGHTER HAS BEEN HERE
I
HAVE TRACED HER
WHAT HAS SHE BEEN SAYING TO YOU
IT IS A LITTLE COLD FOR THE TIME OF THE YEAR SAID HOLMES
WHAT HAS SHE BEEN SAYING TO YOU SCREAMED THE OLD MAN
FURIOUSLY
BUT I HAVE HEARD THAT THE CROCUSES PROMISE WELL CONTINUED MY
COMPANION IMPERTURBABLY
HA YOU PUT ME OFF DO YOU SAID OUR NEW VISITOR TAKING A STEP
FORWARD AND SHAKING HIS HUNTING CROP
I KNOW YOU YOU SCOUNDREL
I HAVE HEARD OF YOU BEFORE
YOU ARE HOLMES THE MEDDLER
MY FRIEND SMILED
HOLMES THE BUSYBODY
HIS SMILE BROADENED
HOLMES THE SCOTLAND YARD JACK IN OFFICE
HOLMES CHUCKLED HEARTILY
YOUR CONVERSATION IS MOST
ENTERTAINING SAID HE
WHEN YOU GO OUT CLOSE THE DOOR FOR
THERE IS A DECIDED DRAUGHT
I WILL GO WHEN I HAVE SAID MY SAY
DON'T YOU DARE TO MEDDLE WITH
MY AFFAIRS
I KNOW THAT MISS STONER HAS BEEN HERE
I TRACED HER
I AM A DANGEROUS MAN TO FALL FOUL OF SEE HERE HE STEPPED
SWIFTLY FORWARD SEIZED THE POKER AND BENT IT INTO A CURVE WITH
HIS HUGE BROWN HANDS
SEE THAT YOU KEEP YOURSELF OUT OF MY GRIP HE SNARLED AND
HURLING THE TWISTED POKER INTO THE FIREPLACE HE STRODE OUT OF THE
ROOM
HE SEEMS A VERY AMIABLE PERSON SAID HOLMES LAUGHING
I AM
NOT QUITE SO BULKY BUT IF HE HAD REMAINED I MIGHT HAVE SHOWN HIM
THAT MY GRIP WAS NOT MUCH MORE FEEBLE THAN HIS OWN AS HE SPOKE
HE PICKED UP THE STEEL POKER AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT
STRAIGHTENED IT OUT AGAIN
FANCY HIS HAVING THE INSOLENCE TO CONFOUND ME WITH THE OFFICIAL
DETECTIVE FORCE THIS INCIDENT GIVES ZEST TO OUR INVESTIGATION
HOWEVER AND I ONLY TRUST THAT OUR LITTLE FRIEND WILL NOT SUFFER
FROM HER IMPRUDENCE IN ALLOWING THIS BRUTE TO TRACE HER
AND NOW
WATSON WE SHALL ORDER BREAKFAST AND AFTERWARDS I SHALL WALK
DOWN TO DOCTORS' COMMONS WHERE I HOPE TO GET SOME DATA WHICH MAY
HELP US IN THIS MATTER
IT WAS NEARLY ONE O'CLOCK WHEN SHERLOCK HOLMES RETURNED FROM HIS
EXCURSION
HE HELD IN HIS HAND A SHEET OF BLUE PAPER SCRAWLED
OVER WITH NOTES AND FIGURES
I HAVE SEEN THE WILL OF THE DECEASED WIFE SAID HE
TO
DETERMINE ITS EXACT MEANING I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO WORK OUT THE
PRESENT PRICES OF THE INVESTMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS CONCERNED
THE
TOTAL INCOME WHICH AT THE TIME OF THE WIFE'S DEATH WAS LITTLE
SHORT OF 1100 POUNDS IS NOW THROUGH THE FALL IN AGRICULTURAL
PRICES NOT MORE THAN 750 POUNDS
EACH DAUGHTER CAN CLAIM AN
INCOME OF 250 POUNDS IN CASE OF MARRIAGE
IT IS EVIDENT
THEREFORE THAT IF BOTH GIRLS HAD MARRIED THIS BEAUTY WOULD HAVE
HAD A MERE PITTANCE WHILE EVEN ONE OF THEM WOULD CRIPPLE HIM TO
A VERY SERIOUS EXTENT
MY MORNING'S WORK HAS NOT BEEN WASTED
SINCE IT HAS PROVED THAT HE HAS THE VERY STRONGEST MOTIVES FOR
STANDING IN THE WAY OF ANYTHING OF THE SORT
AND NOW WATSON
THIS IS TOO SERIOUS FOR DAWDLING ESPECIALLY AS THE OLD MAN IS
AWARE THAT WE ARE INTERESTING OURSELVES IN HIS AFFAIRS SO IF YOU
ARE READY WE SHALL CALL A CAB AND DRIVE TO WATERLOO
I SHOULD BE
VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD SLIP YOUR REVOLVER INTO YOUR
POCKET
AN ELEY'S NO
2 IS AN EXCELLENT ARGUMENT WITH GENTLEMEN
WHO CAN TWIST STEEL POKERS INTO KNOTS
THAT AND A TOOTH BRUSH
ARE I THINK ALL THAT WE NEED
AT WATERLOO WE WERE FORTUNATE IN CATCHING A TRAIN FOR
LEATHERHEAD WHERE WE HIRED A TRAP AT THE STATION INN AND DROVE
FOR FOUR OR FIVE MILES THROUGH THE LOVELY SURREY LANES
IT WAS A
PERFECT DAY WITH A BRIGHT SUN AND A FEW FLEECY CLOUDS IN THE
HEAVENS
THE TREES AND WAYSIDE HEDGES WERE JUST THROWING OUT
THEIR FIRST GREEN SHOOTS AND THE AIR WAS FULL OF THE PLEASANT
SMELL OF THE MOIST EARTH
TO ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A STRANGE
CONTRAST BETWEEN THE SWEET PROMISE OF THE SPRING AND THIS
SINISTER QUEST UPON WHICH WE WERE ENGAGED
MY COMPANION SAT IN
THE FRONT OF THE TRAP HIS ARMS FOLDED HIS HAT PULLED DOWN OVER
HIS EYES AND HIS CHIN SUNK UPON HIS BREAST BURIED IN THE
DEEPEST THOUGHT
SUDDENLY HOWEVER HE STARTED TAPPED ME ON THE
SHOULDER AND POINTED OVER THE MEADOWS
LOOK THERE SAID HE
A HEAVILY TIMBERED PARK STRETCHED UP IN A GENTLE SLOPE
THICKENING INTO A GROVE AT THE HIGHEST POINT
FROM AMID THE
BRANCHES THERE JUTTED OUT THE GREY GABLES AND HIGH ROOF TREE OF A
VERY OLD MANSION
STOKE MORAN SAID HE
YES SIR THAT BE THE HOUSE OF DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT REMARKED
THE DRIVER
THERE IS SOME BUILDING GOING ON THERE SAID HOLMES THAT IS
WHERE WE ARE GOING
THERE'S THE VILLAGE SAID THE DRIVER POINTING TO A CLUSTER OF
ROOFS SOME DISTANCE TO THE LEFT BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE
HOUSE YOU'LL FIND IT SHORTER TO GET OVER THIS STILE AND SO BY
THE FOOT PATH OVER THE FIELDS
THERE IT IS WHERE THE LADY IS
WALKING
AND THE LADY I FANCY IS MISS STONER OBSERVED HOLMES SHADING
HIS EYES
YES I THINK WE HAD BETTER DO AS YOU SUGGEST
WE GOT OFF PAID OUR FARE AND THE TRAP RATTLED BACK ON ITS WAY
TO LEATHERHEAD
I THOUGHT IT AS WELL SAID HOLMES AS WE CLIMBED THE STILE
THAT THIS FELLOW SHOULD THINK WE HAD COME HERE AS ARCHITECTS OR
ON SOME DEFINITE BUSINESS
IT MAY STOP HIS GOSSIP
GOOD AFTERNOON MISS STONER
YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE BEEN AS GOOD AS
OUR WORD
OUR CLIENT OF THE MORNING HAD HURRIED FORWARD TO MEET US WITH A
FACE WHICH SPOKE HER JOY
I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO EAGERLY FOR
YOU SHE CRIED SHAKING HANDS WITH US WARMLY
ALL HAS TURNED
OUT SPLENDIDLY
DR
ROYLOTT HAS GONE TO TOWN AND IT IS UNLIKELY
THAT HE WILL BE BACK BEFORE EVENING
WE HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MAKING THE DOCTOR'S ACQUAINTANCE
SAID HOLMES AND IN A FEW WORDS HE SKETCHED OUT WHAT HAD
OCCURRED
MISS STONER TURNED WHITE TO THE LIPS AS SHE LISTENED
GOOD HEAVENS SHE CRIED HE HAS FOLLOWED ME THEN
SO IT APPEARS
HE IS SO CUNNING THAT I NEVER KNOW WHEN I AM SAFE FROM HIM
WHAT
WILL HE SAY WHEN HE RETURNS
HE MUST GUARD HIMSELF FOR HE MAY FIND THAT THERE IS SOMEONE
MORE CUNNING THAN HIMSELF UPON HIS TRACK
YOU MUST LOCK YOURSELF
UP FROM HIM TO NIGHT
IF HE IS VIOLENT WE SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY TO
YOUR AUNT'S AT HARROW
NOW WE MUST MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR
TIME SO KINDLY TAKE US AT ONCE TO THE ROOMS WHICH WE ARE TO
EXAMINE
THE BUILDING WAS OF GREY LICHEN BLOTCHED STONE WITH A HIGH
CENTRAL PORTION AND TWO CURVING WINGS LIKE THE CLAWS OF A CRAB
THROWN OUT ON EACH SIDE
IN ONE OF THESE WINGS THE WINDOWS WERE
BROKEN AND BLOCKED WITH WOODEN BOARDS WHILE THE ROOF WAS PARTLY
CAVED IN A PICTURE OF RUIN
THE CENTRAL PORTION WAS IN LITTLE
BETTER REPAIR BUT THE RIGHT HAND BLOCK WAS COMPARATIVELY MODERN
AND THE BLINDS IN THE WINDOWS WITH THE BLUE SMOKE CURLING UP
FROM THE CHIMNEYS SHOWED THAT THIS WAS WHERE THE FAMILY RESIDED
SOME SCAFFOLDING HAD BEEN ERECTED AGAINST THE END WALL AND THE
STONE WORK HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF ANY
WORKMEN AT THE MOMENT OF OUR VISIT
HOLMES WALKED SLOWLY UP AND
DOWN THE ILL TRIMMED LAWN AND EXAMINED WITH DEEP ATTENTION THE
OUTSIDES OF THE WINDOWS
THIS I TAKE IT BELONGS TO THE ROOM IN WHICH YOU USED TO SLEEP
THE CENTRE ONE TO YOUR SISTER'S AND THE ONE NEXT TO THE MAIN
BUILDING TO DR
ROYLOTT'S CHAMBER
EXACTLY SO
BUT I AM NOW SLEEPING IN THE MIDDLE ONE
PENDING THE ALTERATIONS AS I UNDERSTAND
BY THE WAY THERE DOES
NOT SEEM TO BE ANY VERY PRESSING NEED FOR REPAIRS AT THAT END
WALL
THERE WERE NONE
I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS AN EXCUSE TO MOVE ME FROM
MY ROOM
AH THAT IS SUGGESTIVE
NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS NARROW
WING RUNS THE CORRIDOR FROM WHICH THESE THREE ROOMS OPEN
THERE
ARE WINDOWS IN IT OF COURSE
YES BUT VERY SMALL ONES
TOO NARROW FOR ANYONE TO PASS
THROUGH
AS YOU BOTH LOCKED YOUR DOORS AT NIGHT YOUR ROOMS WERE
UNAPPROACHABLE FROM THAT SIDE
NOW WOULD YOU HAVE THE KINDNESS
TO GO INTO YOUR ROOM AND BAR YOUR SHUTTERS
MISS STONER DID SO AND HOLMES AFTER A CAREFUL EXAMINATION
THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW ENDEAVOURED IN EVERY WAY TO FORCE THE
SHUTTER OPEN BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS
THERE WAS NO SLIT THROUGH
WHICH A KNIFE COULD BE PASSED TO RAISE THE BAR
THEN WITH HIS
LENS HE TESTED THE HINGES BUT THEY WERE OF SOLID IRON BUILT
FIRMLY INTO THE MASSIVE MASONRY
HUM SAID HE SCRATCHING HIS
CHIN IN SOME PERPLEXITY MY THEORY CERTAINLY PRESENTS SOME
DIFFICULTIES
NO ONE COULD PASS THESE SHUTTERS IF THEY WERE
BOLTED
WELL WE SHALL SEE IF THE INSIDE THROWS ANY LIGHT UPON
THE MATTER
A SMALL SIDE DOOR LED INTO THE WHITEWASHED CORRIDOR FROM WHICH
THE THREE BEDROOMS OPENED
HOLMES REFUSED TO EXAMINE THE THIRD
CHAMBER SO WE PASSED AT ONCE TO THE SECOND THAT IN WHICH MISS
STONER WAS NOW SLEEPING AND IN WHICH HER SISTER HAD MET WITH HER
FATE
IT WAS A HOMELY LITTLE ROOM WITH A LOW CEILING AND A
GAPING FIREPLACE AFTER THE FASHION OF OLD COUNTRY HOUSES
A
BROWN CHEST OF DRAWERS STOOD IN ONE CORNER A NARROW
WHITE COUNTERPANED BED IN ANOTHER AND A DRESSING TABLE ON THE
LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE WINDOW
THESE ARTICLES WITH TWO SMALL
WICKER WORK CHAIRS MADE UP ALL THE FURNITURE IN THE ROOM SAVE
FOR A SQUARE OF WILTON CARPET IN THE CENTRE
THE BOARDS ROUND AND
THE PANELLING OF THE WALLS WERE OF BROWN WORM EATEN OAK SO OLD
AND DISCOLOURED THAT IT MAY HAVE DATED FROM THE ORIGINAL BUILDING
OF THE HOUSE
HOLMES DREW ONE OF THE CHAIRS INTO A CORNER AND SAT
SILENT WHILE HIS EYES TRAVELLED ROUND AND ROUND AND UP AND DOWN
TAKING IN EVERY DETAIL OF THE APARTMENT
WHERE DOES THAT BELL COMMUNICATE WITH HE ASKED AT LAST
POINTING TO A THICK BELL ROPE WHICH HUNG DOWN BESIDE THE BED THE
TASSEL ACTUALLY LYING UPON THE PILLOW
IT GOES TO THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM
IT LOOKS NEWER THAN THE OTHER THINGS
YES IT WAS ONLY PUT THERE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
YOUR SISTER ASKED FOR IT I SUPPOSE
NO I NEVER HEARD OF HER USING IT
WE USED ALWAYS TO GET WHAT WE
WANTED FOR OURSELVES
INDEED IT SEEMED UNNECESSARY TO PUT SO NICE A BELL PULL THERE
YOU WILL EXCUSE ME FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE I SATISFY MYSELF AS TO
THIS FLOOR HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN UPON HIS FACE WITH HIS LENS IN
HIS HAND AND CRAWLED SWIFTLY BACKWARD AND FORWARD EXAMINING
MINUTELY THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE BOARDS
THEN HE DID THE SAME WITH
THE WOOD WORK WITH WHICH THE CHAMBER WAS PANELLED
FINALLY HE
WALKED OVER TO THE BED AND SPENT SOME TIME IN STARING AT IT AND
IN RUNNING HIS EYE UP AND DOWN THE WALL
FINALLY HE TOOK THE
BELL ROPE IN HIS HAND AND GAVE IT A BRISK TUG
WHY IT'S A DUMMY SAID HE
WON'T IT RING
NO IT IS NOT EVEN ATTACHED TO A WIRE
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING
YOU CAN SEE NOW THAT IT IS FASTENED TO A HOOK JUST ABOVE WHERE
THE LITTLE OPENING FOR THE VENTILATOR IS
HOW VERY ABSURD I NEVER NOTICED THAT BEFORE
VERY STRANGE MUTTERED HOLMES PULLING AT THE ROPE
THERE ARE
ONE OR TWO VERY SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT THIS ROOM
FOR EXAMPLE
WHAT A FOOL A BUILDER MUST BE TO OPEN A VENTILATOR INTO ANOTHER
ROOM WHEN WITH THE SAME TROUBLE HE MIGHT HAVE COMMUNICATED
WITH THE OUTSIDE AIR
THAT IS ALSO QUITE MODERN SAID THE LADY
DONE ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE BELL ROPE REMARKED HOLMES
YES THERE WERE SEVERAL LITTLE CHANGES CARRIED OUT ABOUT THAT
TIME
THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN OF A MOST INTERESTING CHARACTER DUMMY
BELL ROPES AND VENTILATORS WHICH DO NOT VENTILATE
WITH YOUR
PERMISSION MISS STONER WE SHALL NOW CARRY OUR RESEARCHES INTO
THE INNER APARTMENT
DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT'S CHAMBER WAS LARGER THAN THAT OF HIS
STEP DAUGHTER BUT WAS AS PLAINLY FURNISHED
A CAMP BED A SMALL
WOODEN SHELF FULL OF BOOKS MOSTLY OF A TECHNICAL CHARACTER AN
ARMCHAIR BESIDE THE BED A PLAIN WOODEN CHAIR AGAINST THE WALL A
ROUND TABLE AND A LARGE IRON SAFE WERE THE PRINCIPAL THINGS
WHICH MET THE EYE
HOLMES WALKED SLOWLY ROUND AND EXAMINED EACH
AND ALL OF THEM WITH THE KEENEST INTEREST
WHAT'S IN HERE HE ASKED TAPPING THE SAFE
MY STEPFATHER'S BUSINESS PAPERS
OH YOU HAVE SEEN INSIDE THEN
ONLY ONCE SOME YEARS AGO
I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS FULL OF
PAPERS
THERE ISN'T A CAT IN IT FOR EXAMPLE
NO
WHAT A STRANGE IDEA
WELL LOOK AT THIS HE TOOK UP A SMALL SAUCER OF MILK WHICH
STOOD ON THE TOP OF IT
NO WE DON'T KEEP A CAT
BUT THERE IS A CHEETAH AND A BABOON
AH YES OF COURSE WELL A CHEETAH IS JUST A BIG CAT AND YET A
SAUCER OF MILK DOES NOT GO VERY FAR IN SATISFYING ITS WANTS I
DARESAY
THERE IS ONE POINT WHICH I SHOULD WISH TO DETERMINE HE
SQUATTED DOWN IN FRONT OF THE WOODEN CHAIR AND EXAMINED THE SEAT
OF IT WITH THE GREATEST ATTENTION
THANK YOU
THAT IS QUITE SETTLED SAID HE RISING AND PUTTING
HIS LENS IN HIS POCKET
HULLO HERE IS SOMETHING INTERESTING
THE OBJECT WHICH HAD CAUGHT HIS EYE WAS A SMALL DOG LASH HUNG ON
ONE CORNER OF THE BED
THE LASH HOWEVER WAS CURLED UPON ITSELF
AND TIED SO AS TO MAKE A LOOP OF WHIPCORD
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT WATSON
IT'S A COMMON ENOUGH LASH
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE
TIED
THAT IS NOT QUITE SO COMMON IS IT AH ME IT'S A WICKED WORLD
AND WHEN A CLEVER MAN TURNS HIS BRAINS TO CRIME IT IS THE WORST
OF ALL
I THINK THAT I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH NOW MISS STONER AND
WITH YOUR PERMISSION WE SHALL WALK OUT UPON THE LAWN
I HAD NEVER SEEN MY FRIEND'S FACE SO GRIM OR HIS BROW SO DARK AS
IT WAS WHEN WE TURNED FROM THE SCENE OF THIS INVESTIGATION
WE
HAD WALKED SEVERAL TIMES UP AND DOWN THE LAWN NEITHER MISS
STONER NOR MYSELF LIKING TO BREAK IN UPON HIS THOUGHTS BEFORE HE
ROUSED HIMSELF FROM HIS REVERIE
IT IS VERY ESSENTIAL MISS STONER SAID HE THAT YOU SHOULD
ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW MY ADVICE IN EVERY RESPECT
I SHALL MOST CERTAINLY DO SO
THE MATTER IS TOO SERIOUS FOR ANY HESITATION
YOUR LIFE MAY
DEPEND UPON YOUR COMPLIANCE
I ASSURE YOU THAT I AM IN YOUR HANDS
IN THE FIRST PLACE BOTH MY FRIEND AND I MUST SPEND THE NIGHT IN
YOUR ROOM
BOTH MISS STONER AND I GAZED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
YES IT MUST BE SO
LET ME EXPLAIN
I BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE
VILLAGE INN OVER THERE
YES THAT IS THE CROWN
VERY GOOD
YOUR WINDOWS WOULD BE VISIBLE FROM THERE
CERTAINLY
YOU MUST CONFINE YOURSELF TO YOUR ROOM ON PRETENCE OF A
HEADACHE WHEN YOUR STEPFATHER COMES BACK
THEN WHEN YOU HEAR HIM
RETIRE FOR THE NIGHT YOU MUST OPEN THE SHUTTERS OF YOUR WINDOW
UNDO THE HASP PUT YOUR LAMP THERE AS A SIGNAL TO US AND THEN
WITHDRAW QUIETLY WITH EVERYTHING WHICH YOU ARE LIKELY TO WANT
INTO THE ROOM WHICH YOU USED TO OCCUPY
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN
SPITE OF THE REPAIRS YOU COULD MANAGE THERE FOR ONE NIGHT
OH YES EASILY
THE REST YOU WILL LEAVE IN OUR HANDS
BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO
WE SHALL SPEND THE NIGHT IN YOUR ROOM AND WE SHALL INVESTIGATE
THE CAUSE OF THIS NOISE WHICH HAS DISTURBED YOU
I BELIEVE MR
HOLMES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE UP YOUR MIND
SAID MISS STONER LAYING HER HAND UPON MY COMPANION'S SLEEVE
PERHAPS I HAVE
THEN FOR PITY'S SAKE TELL ME WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF MY SISTER'S
DEATH
I SHOULD PREFER TO HAVE CLEARER PROOFS BEFORE I SPEAK
YOU CAN AT LEAST TELL ME WHETHER MY OWN THOUGHT IS CORRECT AND
IF SHE DIED FROM SOME SUDDEN FRIGHT
NO I DO NOT THINK SO
I THINK THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY SOME MORE
TANGIBLE CAUSE
AND NOW MISS STONER WE MUST LEAVE YOU FOR IF
DR
ROYLOTT RETURNED AND SAW US OUR JOURNEY WOULD BE IN VAIN
GOOD BYE AND BE BRAVE FOR IF YOU WILL DO WHAT I HAVE TOLD YOU
YOU MAY REST ASSURED THAT WE SHALL SOON DRIVE AWAY THE DANGERS
THAT THREATEN YOU
SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN ENGAGING A BEDROOM AND
SITTING ROOM AT THE CROWN INN
THEY WERE ON THE UPPER FLOOR AND
FROM OUR WINDOW WE COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE AVENUE GATE AND
OF THE INHABITED WING OF STOKE MORAN MANOR HOUSE
AT DUSK WE SAW
DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT DRIVE PAST HIS HUGE FORM LOOMING UP BESIDE
THE LITTLE FIGURE OF THE LAD WHO DROVE HIM
THE BOY HAD SOME
SLIGHT DIFFICULTY IN UNDOING THE HEAVY IRON GATES AND WE HEARD
THE HOARSE ROAR OF THE DOCTOR'S VOICE AND SAW THE FURY WITH WHICH
HE SHOOK HIS CLINCHED FISTS AT HIM
THE TRAP DROVE ON AND A FEW
MINUTES LATER WE SAW A SUDDEN LIGHT SPRING UP AMONG THE TREES AS
THE LAMP WAS LIT IN ONE OF THE SITTING ROOMS
DO YOU KNOW WATSON SAID HOLMES AS WE SAT TOGETHER IN THE
GATHERING DARKNESS I HAVE REALLY SOME SCRUPLES AS TO TAKING YOU
TO NIGHT
THERE IS A DISTINCT ELEMENT OF DANGER
CAN I BE OF ASSISTANCE
YOUR PRESENCE MIGHT BE INVALUABLE
THEN I SHALL CERTAINLY COME
IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU
YOU SPEAK OF DANGER
YOU HAVE EVIDENTLY SEEN MORE IN THESE ROOMS
THAN WAS VISIBLE TO ME
NO BUT I FANCY THAT I MAY HAVE DEDUCED A LITTLE MORE
I IMAGINE
THAT YOU SAW ALL THAT I DID
I SAW NOTHING REMARKABLE SAVE THE BELL ROPE AND WHAT PURPOSE
THAT COULD ANSWER I CONFESS IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE
YOU SAW THE VENTILATOR TOO
YES BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS SUCH A VERY UNUSUAL THING TO
HAVE A SMALL OPENING BETWEEN TWO ROOMS
IT WAS SO SMALL THAT A
RAT COULD HARDLY PASS THROUGH
I KNEW THAT WE SHOULD FIND A VENTILATOR BEFORE EVER WE CAME TO
STOKE MORAN
MY DEAR HOLMES
OH YES I DID
YOU REMEMBER IN HER STATEMENT SHE SAID THAT HER
SISTER COULD SMELL DR
ROYLOTT'S CIGAR
NOW OF COURSE THAT
SUGGESTED AT ONCE THAT THERE MUST BE A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE
TWO ROOMS
IT COULD ONLY BE A SMALL ONE OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
REMARKED UPON AT THE CORONER'S INQUIRY
I DEDUCED A VENTILATOR
BUT WHAT HARM CAN THERE BE IN THAT
WELL THERE IS AT LEAST A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE OF DATES
A
VENTILATOR IS MADE A CORD IS HUNG AND A LADY WHO SLEEPS IN THE
BED DIES
DOES NOT THAT STRIKE YOU
I CANNOT AS YET SEE ANY CONNECTION
DID YOU OBSERVE ANYTHING VERY PECULIAR ABOUT THAT BED
NO
IT WAS CLAMPED TO THE FLOOR
DID YOU EVER SEE A BED FASTENED
LIKE THAT BEFORE
I CANNOT SAY THAT I HAVE
THE LADY COULD NOT MOVE HER BED
IT MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME
RELATIVE POSITION TO THE VENTILATOR AND TO THE ROPE OR SO WE MAY
CALL IT SINCE IT WAS CLEARLY NEVER MEANT FOR A BELL PULL
HOLMES I CRIED I SEEM TO SEE DIMLY WHAT YOU ARE HINTING AT
WE ARE ONLY JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT SOME SUBTLE AND HORRIBLE
CRIME
SUBTLE ENOUGH AND HORRIBLE ENOUGH
WHEN A DOCTOR DOES GO WRONG
HE IS THE FIRST OF CRIMINALS
HE HAS NERVE AND HE HAS KNOWLEDGE
PALMER AND PRITCHARD WERE AMONG THE HEADS OF THEIR PROFESSION
THIS MAN STRIKES EVEN DEEPER BUT I THINK WATSON THAT WE SHALL
BE ABLE TO STRIKE DEEPER STILL
BUT WE SHALL HAVE HORRORS ENOUGH
BEFORE THE NIGHT IS OVER FOR GOODNESS' SAKE LET US HAVE A QUIET
PIPE AND TURN OUR MINDS FOR A FEW HOURS TO SOMETHING MORE
CHEERFUL
ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THE LIGHT AMONG THE TREES WAS EXTINGUISHED
AND ALL WAS DARK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MANOR HOUSE
TWO HOURS
PASSED SLOWLY AWAY AND THEN SUDDENLY JUST AT THE STROKE OF
ELEVEN A SINGLE BRIGHT LIGHT SHONE OUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF US
THAT IS OUR SIGNAL SAID HOLMES SPRINGING TO HIS FEET IT
COMES FROM THE MIDDLE WINDOW
AS WE PASSED OUT HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH THE LANDLORD
EXPLAINING THAT WE WERE GOING ON A LATE VISIT TO AN ACQUAINTANCE
AND THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT WE MIGHT SPEND THE NIGHT THERE
A
MOMENT LATER WE WERE OUT ON THE DARK ROAD A CHILL WIND BLOWING
IN OUR FACES AND ONE YELLOW LIGHT TWINKLING IN FRONT OF US
THROUGH THE GLOOM TO GUIDE US ON OUR SOMBRE ERRAND
THERE WAS LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN ENTERING THE GROUNDS FOR
UNREPAIRED BREACHES GAPED IN THE OLD PARK WALL
MAKING OUR WAY
AMONG THE TREES WE REACHED THE LAWN CROSSED IT AND WERE ABOUT
TO ENTER THROUGH THE WINDOW WHEN OUT FROM A CLUMP OF LAUREL
BUSHES THERE DARTED WHAT SEEMED TO BE A HIDEOUS AND DISTORTED
CHILD WHO THREW ITSELF UPON THE GRASS WITH WRITHING LIMBS AND
THEN RAN SWIFTLY ACROSS THE LAWN INTO THE DARKNESS
MY GOD I WHISPERED DID YOU SEE IT
HOLMES WAS FOR THE MOMENT AS STARTLED AS I
HIS HAND CLOSED LIKE
A VICE UPON MY WRIST IN HIS AGITATION
THEN HE BROKE INTO A LOW
LAUGH AND PUT HIS LIPS TO MY EAR
IT IS A NICE HOUSEHOLD HE MURMURED
THAT IS THE BABOON
I HAD FORGOTTEN THE STRANGE PETS WHICH THE DOCTOR AFFECTED
THERE
WAS A CHEETAH TOO PERHAPS WE MIGHT FIND IT UPON OUR SHOULDERS
AT ANY MOMENT
I CONFESS THAT I FELT EASIER IN MY MIND WHEN
AFTER FOLLOWING HOLMES' EXAMPLE AND SLIPPING OFF MY SHOES I
FOUND MYSELF INSIDE THE BEDROOM
MY COMPANION NOISELESSLY CLOSED
THE SHUTTERS MOVED THE LAMP ONTO THE TABLE AND CAST HIS EYES
ROUND THE ROOM
ALL WAS AS WE HAD SEEN IT IN THE DAYTIME
THEN
CREEPING UP TO ME AND MAKING A TRUMPET OF HIS HAND HE WHISPERED
INTO MY EAR AGAIN SO GENTLY THAT IT WAS ALL THAT I COULD DO TO
DISTINGUISH THE WORDS
THE LEAST SOUND WOULD BE FATAL TO OUR PLANS
I NODDED TO SHOW THAT I HAD HEARD
WE MUST SIT WITHOUT LIGHT
HE WOULD SEE IT THROUGH THE
VENTILATOR
I NODDED AGAIN
DO NOT GO ASLEEP YOUR VERY LIFE MAY DEPEND UPON IT
HAVE YOUR
PISTOL READY IN CASE WE SHOULD NEED IT
I WILL SIT ON THE SIDE OF
THE BED AND YOU IN THAT CHAIR
I TOOK OUT MY REVOLVER AND LAID IT ON THE CORNER OF THE TABLE
HOLMES HAD BROUGHT UP A LONG THIN CANE AND THIS HE PLACED UPON
THE BED BESIDE HIM
BY IT HE LAID THE BOX OF MATCHES AND THE
STUMP OF A CANDLE
THEN HE TURNED DOWN THE LAMP AND WE WERE LEFT
IN DARKNESS
HOW SHALL I EVER FORGET THAT DREADFUL VIGIL I COULD NOT HEAR A
SOUND NOT EVEN THE DRAWING OF A BREATH AND YET I KNEW THAT MY
COMPANION SAT OPEN EYED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF ME IN THE SAME
STATE OF NERVOUS TENSION IN WHICH I WAS MYSELF
THE SHUTTERS CUT
OFF THE LEAST RAY OF LIGHT AND WE WAITED IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS
FROM OUTSIDE CAME THE OCCASIONAL CRY OF A NIGHT BIRD AND ONCE AT
OUR VERY WINDOW A LONG DRAWN CATLIKE WHINE WHICH TOLD US THAT
THE CHEETAH WAS INDEED AT LIBERTY
FAR AWAY WE COULD HEAR THE
DEEP TONES OF THE PARISH CLOCK WHICH BOOMED OUT EVERY QUARTER OF
AN HOUR
HOW LONG THEY SEEMED THOSE QUARTERS TWELVE STRUCK AND
ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND STILL WE SAT WAITING SILENTLY FOR
WHATEVER MIGHT BEFALL
SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOMENTARY GLEAM OF A LIGHT UP IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE VENTILATOR WHICH VANISHED IMMEDIATELY BUT WAS
SUCCEEDED BY A STRONG SMELL OF BURNING OIL AND HEATED METAL
SOMEONE IN THE NEXT ROOM HAD LIT A DARK LANTERN
I HEARD A GENTLE
SOUND OF MOVEMENT AND THEN ALL WAS SILENT ONCE MORE THOUGH THE
SMELL GREW STRONGER
FOR HALF AN HOUR I SAT WITH STRAINING EARS
THEN SUDDENLY ANOTHER SOUND BECAME AUDIBLE A VERY GENTLE
SOOTHING SOUND LIKE THAT OF A SMALL JET OF STEAM ESCAPING
CONTINUALLY FROM A KETTLE
THE INSTANT THAT WE HEARD IT HOLMES
SPRANG FROM THE BED STRUCK A MATCH AND LASHED FURIOUSLY WITH
HIS CANE AT THE BELL PULL
YOU SEE IT WATSON HE YELLED
YOU SEE IT
BUT I SAW NOTHING
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HOLMES STRUCK THE LIGHT I
HEARD A LOW CLEAR WHISTLE BUT THE SUDDEN GLARE FLASHING INTO MY
WEARY EYES MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TELL WHAT IT WAS AT WHICH
MY FRIEND LASHED SO SAVAGELY
I COULD HOWEVER SEE THAT HIS FACE
WAS DEADLY PALE AND FILLED WITH HORROR AND LOATHING
HE HAD
CEASED TO STRIKE AND WAS GAZING UP AT THE VENTILATOR WHEN
SUDDENLY THERE BROKE FROM THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT THE MOST
HORRIBLE CRY TO WHICH I HAVE EVER LISTENED
IT SWELLED UP LOUDER
AND LOUDER A HOARSE YELL OF PAIN AND FEAR AND ANGER ALL MINGLED
IN THE ONE DREADFUL SHRIEK
THEY SAY THAT AWAY DOWN IN THE
VILLAGE AND EVEN IN THE DISTANT PARSONAGE THAT CRY RAISED THE
SLEEPERS FROM THEIR BEDS
IT STRUCK COLD TO OUR HEARTS AND I
STOOD GAZING AT HOLMES AND HE AT ME UNTIL THE LAST ECHOES OF IT
HAD DIED AWAY INTO THE SILENCE FROM WHICH IT ROSE
WHAT CAN IT MEAN I GASPED
IT MEANS THAT IT IS ALL OVER HOLMES ANSWERED
AND PERHAPS
AFTER ALL IT IS FOR THE BEST
TAKE YOUR PISTOL AND WE WILL
ENTER DR
ROYLOTT'S ROOM
WITH A GRAVE FACE HE LIT THE LAMP AND LED THE WAY DOWN THE
CORRIDOR
TWICE HE STRUCK AT THE CHAMBER DOOR WITHOUT ANY REPLY
FROM WITHIN
THEN HE TURNED THE HANDLE AND ENTERED I AT HIS
HEELS WITH THE COCKED PISTOL IN MY HAND
IT WAS A SINGULAR SIGHT WHICH MET OUR EYES
ON THE TABLE STOOD A
DARK LANTERN WITH THE SHUTTER HALF OPEN THROWING A BRILLIANT
BEAM OF LIGHT UPON THE IRON SAFE THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS AJAR
BESIDE THIS TABLE ON THE WOODEN CHAIR SAT DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT
CLAD IN A LONG GREY DRESSING GOWN HIS BARE ANKLES PROTRUDING
BENEATH AND HIS FEET THRUST INTO RED HEELLESS TURKISH SLIPPERS
ACROSS HIS LAP LAY THE SHORT STOCK WITH THE LONG LASH WHICH WE
HAD NOTICED DURING THE DAY
HIS CHIN WAS COCKED UPWARD AND HIS
EYES WERE FIXED IN A DREADFUL RIGID STARE AT THE CORNER OF THE
CEILING
ROUND HIS BROW HE HAD A PECULIAR YELLOW BAND WITH
BROWNISH SPECKLES WHICH SEEMED TO BE BOUND TIGHTLY ROUND HIS
HEAD
AS WE ENTERED HE MADE NEITHER SOUND NOR MOTION
THE BAND THE SPECKLED BAND WHISPERED HOLMES
I TOOK A STEP FORWARD
IN AN INSTANT HIS STRANGE HEADGEAR BEGAN
TO MOVE AND THERE REARED ITSELF FROM AMONG HIS HAIR THE SQUAT
DIAMOND SHAPED HEAD AND PUFFED NECK OF A LOATHSOME SERPENT
IT IS A SWAMP ADDER CRIED HOLMES THE DEADLIEST SNAKE IN
INDIA
HE HAS DIED WITHIN TEN SECONDS OF BEING BITTEN
VIOLENCE
DOES IN TRUTH RECOIL UPON THE VIOLENT AND THE SCHEMER FALLS
INTO THE PIT WHICH HE DIGS FOR ANOTHER
LET US THRUST THIS
CREATURE BACK INTO ITS DEN AND WE CAN THEN REMOVE MISS STONER TO
SOME PLACE OF SHELTER AND LET THE COUNTY POLICE KNOW WHAT HAS
HAPPENED
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW THE DOG WHIP SWIFTLY FROM THE DEAD MAN'S LAP
AND THROWING THE NOOSE ROUND THE REPTILE'S NECK HE DREW IT FROM
ITS HORRID PERCH AND CARRYING IT AT ARM'S LENGTH THREW IT INTO
THE IRON SAFE WHICH HE CLOSED UPON IT
SUCH ARE THE TRUE FACTS OF THE DEATH OF DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT OF
STOKE MORAN
IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD PROLONG A
NARRATIVE WHICH HAS ALREADY RUN TO TOO GREAT A LENGTH BY TELLING
HOW WE BROKE THE SAD NEWS TO THE TERRIFIED GIRL HOW WE CONVEYED
HER BY THE MORNING TRAIN TO THE CARE OF HER GOOD AUNT AT HARROW
OF HOW THE SLOW PROCESS OF OFFICIAL INQUIRY CAME TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT THE DOCTOR MET HIS FATE WHILE INDISCREETLY
PLAYING WITH A DANGEROUS PET
THE LITTLE WHICH I HAD YET TO LEARN
OF THE CASE WAS TOLD ME BY SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE TRAVELLED BACK
NEXT DAY
I HAD SAID HE COME TO AN ENTIRELY ERRONEOUS CONCLUSION WHICH
SHOWS MY DEAR WATSON HOW DANGEROUS IT ALWAYS IS TO REASON FROM
INSUFFICIENT DATA
THE PRESENCE OF THE GIPSIES AND THE USE OF
THE WORD 'BAND WHICH WAS USED BY THE POOR GIRL NO DOUBT TO
EXPLAIN THE APPEARANCE WHICH SHE HAD CAUGHT A HURRIED GLIMPSE OF
BY THE LIGHT OF HER MATCH WERE SUFFICIENT TO PUT ME UPON AN
ENTIRELY WRONG SCENT
I CAN ONLY CLAIM THE MERIT THAT I INSTANTLY
RECONSIDERED MY POSITION WHEN HOWEVER IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME
THAT WHATEVER DANGER THREATENED AN OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM COULD NOT
COME EITHER FROM THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR
MY ATTENTION WAS
SPEEDILY DRAWN AS I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED TO YOU TO THIS
VENTILATOR AND TO THE BELL ROPE WHICH HUNG DOWN TO THE BED
THE
DISCOVERY THAT THIS WAS A DUMMY AND THAT THE BED WAS CLAMPED TO
THE FLOOR INSTANTLY GAVE RISE TO THE SUSPICION THAT THE ROPE WAS
THERE AS A BRIDGE FOR SOMETHING PASSING THROUGH THE HOLE AND
COMING TO THE BED
THE IDEA OF A SNAKE INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME
AND WHEN I COUPLED IT WITH MY KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR WAS
FURNISHED WITH A SUPPLY OF CREATURES FROM INDIA I FELT THAT I
WAS PROBABLY ON THE RIGHT TRACK
THE IDEA OF USING A FORM OF
POISON WHICH COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE DISCOVERED BY ANY CHEMICAL
TEST WAS JUST SUCH A ONE AS WOULD OCCUR TO A CLEVER AND RUTHLESS
MAN WHO HAD HAD AN EASTERN TRAINING
THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH SUCH
A POISON WOULD TAKE EFFECT WOULD ALSO FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW BE
AN ADVANTAGE
IT WOULD BE A SHARP EYED CORONER INDEED WHO COULD
DISTINGUISH THE TWO LITTLE DARK PUNCTURES WHICH WOULD SHOW WHERE
THE POISON FANGS HAD DONE THEIR WORK
THEN I THOUGHT OF THE
WHISTLE
OF COURSE HE MUST RECALL THE SNAKE BEFORE THE MORNING
LIGHT REVEALED IT TO THE VICTIM
HE HAD TRAINED IT PROBABLY BY
THE USE OF THE MILK WHICH WE SAW TO RETURN TO HIM WHEN SUMMONED
HE WOULD PUT IT THROUGH THIS VENTILATOR AT THE HOUR THAT HE
THOUGHT BEST WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT IT WOULD CRAWL DOWN THE
ROPE AND LAND ON THE BED
IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BITE THE
OCCUPANT PERHAPS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE EVERY NIGHT FOR A WEEK BUT
SOONER OR LATER SHE MUST FALL A VICTIM
I HAD COME TO THESE CONCLUSIONS BEFORE EVER I HAD ENTERED HIS
ROOM
AN INSPECTION OF HIS CHAIR SHOWED ME THAT HE HAD BEEN IN
THE HABIT OF STANDING ON IT WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE NECESSARY
IN ORDER THAT HE SHOULD REACH THE VENTILATOR
THE SIGHT OF THE
SAFE THE SAUCER OF MILK AND THE LOOP OF WHIPCORD WERE ENOUGH TO
FINALLY DISPEL ANY DOUBTS WHICH MAY HAVE REMAINED
THE METALLIC
CLANG HEARD BY MISS STONER WAS OBVIOUSLY CAUSED BY HER STEPFATHER
HASTILY CLOSING THE DOOR OF HIS SAFE UPON ITS TERRIBLE OCCUPANT
HAVING ONCE MADE UP MY MIND YOU KNOW THE STEPS WHICH I TOOK IN
ORDER TO PUT THE MATTER TO THE PROOF
I HEARD THE CREATURE HISS
AS I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU DID ALSO AND I INSTANTLY LIT THE
LIGHT AND ATTACKED IT
WITH THE RESULT OF DRIVING IT THROUGH THE VENTILATOR
AND ALSO WITH THE RESULT OF CAUSING IT TO TURN UPON ITS MASTER
AT THE OTHER SIDE
SOME OF THE BLOWS OF MY CANE CAME HOME AND
ROUSED ITS SNAKISH TEMPER SO THAT IT FLEW UPON THE FIRST PERSON
IT SAW
IN THIS WAY I AM NO DOUBT INDIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DR
GRIMESBY ROYLOTT'S DEATH AND I CANNOT SAY THAT IT IS LIKELY TO
WEIGH VERY HEAVILY UPON MY CONSCIENCE
IX
THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
OF ALL THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO MY FRIEND MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR SOLUTION DURING THE YEARS OF OUR INTIMACY
THERE WERE ONLY TWO WHICH I WAS THE MEANS OF INTRODUCING TO HIS
NOTICE THAT OF MR
HATHERLEY'S THUMB AND THAT OF COLONEL
WARBURTON'S MADNESS
OF THESE THE LATTER MAY HAVE AFFORDED A
FINER FIELD FOR AN ACUTE AND ORIGINAL OBSERVER BUT THE OTHER WAS
SO STRANGE IN ITS INCEPTION AND SO DRAMATIC IN ITS DETAILS THAT
IT MAY BE THE MORE WORTHY OF BEING PLACED UPON RECORD EVEN IF IT
GAVE MY FRIEND FEWER OPENINGS FOR THOSE DEDUCTIVE METHODS OF
REASONING BY WHICH HE ACHIEVED SUCH REMARKABLE RESULTS
THE STORY
HAS I BELIEVE BEEN TOLD MORE THAN ONCE IN THE NEWSPAPERS BUT
LIKE ALL SUCH NARRATIVES ITS EFFECT IS MUCH LESS STRIKING WHEN
SET FORTH EN BLOC IN A SINGLE HALF COLUMN OF PRINT THAN WHEN THE
FACTS SLOWLY EVOLVE BEFORE YOUR OWN EYES AND THE MYSTERY CLEARS
GRADUALLY AWAY AS EACH NEW DISCOVERY FURNISHES A STEP WHICH LEADS
ON TO THE COMPLETE TRUTH
AT THE TIME THE CIRCUMSTANCES MADE A
DEEP IMPRESSION UPON ME AND THE LAPSE OF TWO YEARS HAS HARDLY
SERVED TO WEAKEN THE EFFECT
IT WAS IN THE SUMMER OF '89 NOT LONG AFTER MY MARRIAGE THAT THE
EVENTS OCCURRED WHICH I AM NOW ABOUT TO SUMMARISE
I HAD RETURNED
TO CIVIL PRACTICE AND HAD FINALLY ABANDONED HOLMES IN HIS BAKER
STREET ROOMS ALTHOUGH I CONTINUALLY VISITED HIM AND OCCASIONALLY
EVEN PERSUADED HIM TO FORGO HIS BOHEMIAN HABITS SO FAR AS TO COME
AND VISIT US
MY PRACTICE HAD STEADILY INCREASED AND AS I
HAPPENED TO LIVE AT NO VERY GREAT DISTANCE FROM PADDINGTON
STATION I GOT A FEW PATIENTS FROM AMONG THE OFFICIALS
ONE OF
THESE WHOM I HAD CURED OF A PAINFUL AND LINGERING DISEASE WAS
NEVER WEARY OF ADVERTISING MY VIRTUES AND OF ENDEAVOURING TO SEND
ME ON EVERY SUFFERER OVER WHOM HE MIGHT HAVE ANY INFLUENCE
ONE MORNING AT A LITTLE BEFORE SEVEN O'CLOCK I WAS AWAKENED BY
THE MAID TAPPING AT THE DOOR TO ANNOUNCE THAT TWO MEN HAD COME
FROM PADDINGTON AND WERE WAITING IN THE CONSULTING ROOM
I
DRESSED HURRIEDLY FOR I KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT RAILWAY CASES
WERE SELDOM TRIVIAL AND HASTENED DOWNSTAIRS
AS I DESCENDED MY
OLD ALLY THE GUARD CAME OUT OF THE ROOM AND CLOSED THE DOOR
TIGHTLY BEHIND HIM
I'VE GOT HIM HERE HE WHISPERED JERKING HIS THUMB OVER HIS
SHOULDER HE'S ALL RIGHT
WHAT IS IT THEN I ASKED FOR HIS MANNER SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS
SOME STRANGE CREATURE WHICH HE HAD CAGED UP IN MY ROOM
IT'S A NEW PATIENT HE WHISPERED
I THOUGHT I'D BRING HIM
ROUND MYSELF THEN HE COULDN'T SLIP AWAY
THERE HE IS ALL SAFE
AND SOUND
I MUST GO NOW DOCTOR I HAVE MY DOOTIES JUST THE
SAME AS YOU AND OFF HE WENT THIS TRUSTY TOUT WITHOUT EVEN
GIVING ME TIME TO THANK HIM
I ENTERED MY CONSULTING ROOM AND FOUND A GENTLEMAN SEATED BY THE
TABLE
HE WAS QUIETLY DRESSED IN A SUIT OF HEATHER TWEED WITH A
SOFT CLOTH CAP WHICH HE HAD LAID DOWN UPON MY BOOKS
ROUND ONE OF
HIS HANDS HE HAD A HANDKERCHIEF WRAPPED WHICH WAS MOTTLED ALL
OVER WITH BLOODSTAINS
HE WAS YOUNG NOT MORE THAN
FIVE AND TWENTY I SHOULD SAY WITH A STRONG MASCULINE FACE BUT
HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PALE AND GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION OF A MAN WHO
WAS SUFFERING FROM SOME STRONG AGITATION WHICH IT TOOK ALL HIS
STRENGTH OF MIND TO CONTROL
I AM SORRY TO KNOCK YOU UP SO EARLY DOCTOR SAID HE BUT I
HAVE HAD A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT DURING THE NIGHT
I CAME IN BY
TRAIN THIS MORNING AND ON INQUIRING AT PADDINGTON AS TO WHERE I
MIGHT FIND A DOCTOR A WORTHY FELLOW VERY KINDLY ESCORTED ME
HERE
I GAVE THE MAID A CARD BUT I SEE THAT SHE HAS LEFT IT UPON
THE SIDE TABLE
I TOOK IT UP AND GLANCED AT IT
MR
VICTOR HATHERLEY HYDRAULIC
ENGINEER 16A VICTORIA STREET 3RD FLOOR THAT WAS THE NAME
STYLE AND ABODE OF MY MORNING VISITOR
I REGRET THAT I HAVE
KEPT YOU WAITING SAID I SITTING DOWN IN MY LIBRARY CHAIR
YOU
ARE FRESH FROM A NIGHT JOURNEY I UNDERSTAND WHICH IS IN ITSELF
A MONOTONOUS OCCUPATION
OH MY NIGHT COULD NOT BE CALLED MONOTONOUS SAID HE AND
LAUGHED
HE LAUGHED VERY HEARTILY WITH A HIGH RINGING NOTE
LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND SHAKING HIS SIDES
ALL MY MEDICAL
INSTINCTS ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LAUGH
STOP IT I CRIED PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER AND I POURED OUT
SOME WATER FROM A CARAFFE
IT WAS USELESS HOWEVER
HE WAS OFF IN ONE OF THOSE HYSTERICAL
OUTBURSTS WHICH COME UPON A STRONG NATURE WHEN SOME GREAT CRISIS
IS OVER AND GONE
PRESENTLY HE CAME TO HIMSELF ONCE MORE VERY
WEARY AND PALE LOOKING
I HAVE BEEN MAKING A FOOL OF MYSELF HE GASPED
NOT AT ALL
DRINK THIS I DASHED SOME BRANDY INTO THE WATER
AND THE COLOUR BEGAN TO COME BACK TO HIS BLOODLESS CHEEKS
THAT'S BETTER SAID HE
AND NOW DOCTOR PERHAPS YOU WOULD
KINDLY ATTEND TO MY THUMB OR RATHER TO THE PLACE WHERE MY THUMB
USED TO BE
HE UNWOUND THE HANDKERCHIEF AND HELD OUT HIS HAND
IT GAVE EVEN
MY HARDENED NERVES A SHUDDER TO LOOK AT IT
THERE WERE FOUR
PROTRUDING FINGERS AND A HORRID RED SPONGY SURFACE WHERE THE
THUMB SHOULD HAVE BEEN
IT HAD BEEN HACKED OR TORN RIGHT OUT FROM
THE ROOTS
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED THIS IS A TERRIBLE INJURY
IT MUST HAVE
BLED CONSIDERABLY
YES IT DID
I FAINTED WHEN IT WAS DONE AND I THINK THAT I MUST
HAVE BEEN SENSELESS FOR A LONG TIME
WHEN I CAME TO I FOUND THAT
IT WAS STILL BLEEDING SO I TIED ONE END OF MY HANDKERCHIEF VERY
TIGHTLY ROUND THE WRIST AND BRACED IT UP WITH A TWIG
EXCELLENT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SURGEON
IT IS A QUESTION OF HYDRAULICS YOU SEE AND CAME WITHIN MY OWN
PROVINCE
THIS HAS BEEN DONE SAID I EXAMINING THE WOUND BY A VERY
HEAVY AND SHARP INSTRUMENT
A THING LIKE A CLEAVER SAID HE
AN ACCIDENT I PRESUME
BY NO MEANS
WHAT A MURDEROUS ATTACK
VERY MURDEROUS INDEED
YOU HORRIFY ME
I SPONGED THE WOUND CLEANED IT DRESSED IT AND FINALLY COVERED
IT OVER WITH COTTON WADDING AND CARBOLISED BANDAGES
HE LAY BACK
WITHOUT WINCING THOUGH HE BIT HIS LIP FROM TIME TO TIME
HOW IS THAT I ASKED WHEN I HAD FINISHED
CAPITAL BETWEEN YOUR BRANDY AND YOUR BANDAGE I FEEL A NEW MAN
I WAS VERY WEAK BUT I HAVE HAD A GOOD DEAL TO GO THROUGH
PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER NOT SPEAK OF THE MATTER
IT IS EVIDENTLY
TRYING TO YOUR NERVES
OH NO NOT NOW
I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY TALE TO THE POLICE
BUT BETWEEN OURSELVES IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE CONVINCING
EVIDENCE OF THIS WOUND OF MINE I SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY
BELIEVED MY STATEMENT FOR IT IS A VERY EXTRAORDINARY ONE AND I
HAVE NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF PROOF WITH WHICH TO BACK IT UP AND
EVEN IF THEY BELIEVE ME THE CLUES WHICH I CAN GIVE THEM ARE SO
VAGUE THAT IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER JUSTICE WILL BE DONE
HA CRIED I IF IT IS ANYTHING IN THE NATURE OF A PROBLEM
WHICH YOU DESIRE TO SEE SOLVED I SHOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU
TO COME TO MY FRIEND MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES BEFORE YOU GO TO THE
OFFICIAL POLICE
OH I HAVE HEARD OF THAT FELLOW ANSWERED MY VISITOR AND I
SHOULD BE VERY GLAD IF HE WOULD TAKE THE MATTER UP THOUGH OF
COURSE I MUST USE THE OFFICIAL POLICE AS WELL
WOULD YOU GIVE ME
AN INTRODUCTION TO HIM
I'LL DO BETTER
I'LL TAKE YOU ROUND TO HIM MYSELF
I SHOULD BE IMMENSELY OBLIGED TO YOU
WE'LL CALL A CAB AND GO TOGETHER
WE SHALL JUST BE IN TIME TO
HAVE A LITTLE BREAKFAST WITH HIM
DO YOU FEEL EQUAL TO IT
YES I SHALL NOT FEEL EASY UNTIL I HAVE TOLD MY STORY
THEN MY SERVANT WILL CALL A CAB AND I SHALL BE WITH YOU IN AN
INSTANT I RUSHED UPSTAIRS EXPLAINED THE MATTER SHORTLY TO MY
WIFE AND IN FIVE MINUTES WAS INSIDE A HANSOM DRIVING WITH MY
NEW ACQUAINTANCE TO BAKER STREET
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS AS I EXPECTED LOUNGING ABOUT HIS
SITTING ROOM IN HIS DRESSING GOWN READING THE AGONY COLUMN OF THE
TIMES AND SMOKING HIS BEFORE BREAKFAST PIPE WHICH WAS COMPOSED
OF ALL THE PLUGS AND DOTTLES LEFT FROM HIS SMOKES OF THE DAY
BEFORE ALL CAREFULLY DRIED AND COLLECTED ON THE CORNER OF THE
MANTELPIECE
HE RECEIVED US IN HIS QUIETLY GENIAL FASHION
ORDERED FRESH RASHERS AND EGGS AND JOINED US IN A HEARTY MEAL
WHEN IT WAS CONCLUDED HE SETTLED OUR NEW ACQUAINTANCE UPON THE
SOFA PLACED A PILLOW BENEATH HIS HEAD AND LAID A GLASS OF
BRANDY AND WATER WITHIN HIS REACH
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN NO COMMON ONE
MR
HATHERLEY SAID HE
PRAY LIE DOWN THERE AND MAKE YOURSELF
ABSOLUTELY AT HOME
TELL US WHAT YOU CAN BUT STOP WHEN YOU ARE
TIRED AND KEEP UP YOUR STRENGTH WITH A LITTLE STIMULANT
THANK YOU SAID MY PATIENT BUT I HAVE FELT ANOTHER MAN SINCE
THE DOCTOR BANDAGED ME AND I THINK THAT YOUR BREAKFAST HAS
COMPLETED THE CURE
I SHALL TAKE UP AS LITTLE OF YOUR VALUABLE
TIME AS POSSIBLE SO I SHALL START AT ONCE UPON MY PECULIAR
EXPERIENCES
HOLMES SAT IN HIS BIG ARMCHAIR WITH THE WEARY HEAVY LIDDED
EXPRESSION WHICH VEILED HIS KEEN AND EAGER NATURE WHILE I SAT
OPPOSITE TO HIM AND WE LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THE STRANGE STORY
WHICH OUR VISITOR DETAILED TO US
YOU MUST KNOW SAID HE THAT I AM AN ORPHAN AND A BACHELOR
RESIDING ALONE IN LODGINGS IN LONDON
BY PROFESSION I AM A
HYDRAULIC ENGINEER AND I HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF MY
WORK DURING THE SEVEN YEARS THAT I WAS APPRENTICED TO VENNER
MATHESON THE WELL KNOWN FIRM OF GREENWICH
TWO YEARS AGO
HAVING SERVED MY TIME AND HAVING ALSO COME INTO A FAIR SUM OF
MONEY THROUGH MY POOR FATHER'S DEATH I DETERMINED TO START IN
BUSINESS FOR MYSELF AND TOOK PROFESSIONAL CHAMBERS IN VICTORIA
STREET
I SUPPOSE THAT EVERYONE FINDS HIS FIRST INDEPENDENT START IN
BUSINESS A DREARY EXPERIENCE
TO ME IT HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONALLY SO
DURING TWO YEARS I HAVE HAD THREE CONSULTATIONS AND ONE SMALL
JOB AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ALL THAT MY PROFESSION HAS BROUGHT
ME
MY GROSS TAKINGS AMOUNT TO 27 POUNDS 10S
EVERY DAY FROM
NINE IN THE MORNING UNTIL FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON I WAITED IN MY
LITTLE DEN UNTIL AT LAST MY HEART BEGAN TO SINK AND I CAME TO
BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ANY PRACTICE AT ALL
YESTERDAY HOWEVER JUST AS I WAS THINKING OF LEAVING THE
OFFICE MY CLERK ENTERED TO SAY THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN WAITING WHO
WISHED TO SEE ME UPON BUSINESS
HE BROUGHT UP A CARD TOO WITH
THE NAME OF 'COLONEL LYSANDER STARK' ENGRAVED UPON IT
CLOSE AT
HIS HEELS CAME THE COLONEL HIMSELF A MAN RATHER OVER THE MIDDLE
SIZE BUT OF AN EXCEEDING THINNESS
I DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE
EVER SEEN SO THIN A MAN
HIS WHOLE FACE SHARPENED AWAY INTO NOSE
AND CHIN AND THE SKIN OF HIS CHEEKS WAS DRAWN QUITE TENSE OVER
HIS OUTSTANDING BONES
YET THIS EMACIATION SEEMED TO BE HIS
NATURAL HABIT AND DUE TO NO DISEASE FOR HIS EYE WAS BRIGHT HIS
STEP BRISK AND HIS BEARING ASSURED
HE WAS PLAINLY BUT NEATLY
DRESSED AND HIS AGE I SHOULD JUDGE WOULD BE NEARER FORTY THAN
THIRTY
'MR
HATHERLEY SAID HE WITH SOMETHING OF A GERMAN ACCENT
'YOU HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO ME MR
HATHERLEY AS BEING A MAN
WHO IS NOT ONLY PROFICIENT IN HIS PROFESSION BUT IS ALSO DISCREET
AND CAPABLE OF PRESERVING A SECRET
I BOWED FEELING AS FLATTERED AS ANY YOUNG MAN WOULD AT SUCH AN
ADDRESS
'MAY I ASK WHO IT WAS WHO GAVE ME SO GOOD A CHARACTER
'WELL PERHAPS IT IS BETTER THAT I SHOULD NOT TELL YOU THAT JUST
AT THIS MOMENT
I HAVE IT FROM THE SAME SOURCE THAT YOU ARE BOTH
AN ORPHAN AND A BACHELOR AND ARE RESIDING ALONE IN LONDON
'THAT IS QUITE CORRECT I ANSWERED 'BUT YOU WILL EXCUSE ME IF
I SAY THAT I CANNOT SEE HOW ALL THIS BEARS UPON MY PROFESSIONAL
QUALIFICATIONS
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS ON A PROFESSIONAL MATTER
THAT YOU WISHED TO SPEAK TO ME
'UNDOUBTEDLY SO
BUT YOU WILL FIND THAT ALL I SAY IS REALLY TO
THE POINT
I HAVE A PROFESSIONAL COMMISSION FOR YOU BUT ABSOLUTE
SECRECY IS QUITE ESSENTIAL ABSOLUTE SECRECY YOU UNDERSTAND AND
OF COURSE WE MAY EXPECT THAT MORE FROM A MAN WHO IS ALONE THAN
FROM ONE WHO LIVES IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY
'IF I PROMISE TO KEEP A SECRET SAID I 'YOU MAY ABSOLUTELY
DEPEND UPON MY DOING SO
HE LOOKED VERY HARD AT ME AS I SPOKE AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I
HAD NEVER SEEN SO SUSPICIOUS AND QUESTIONING AN EYE
'DO YOU PROMISE THEN SAID HE AT LAST
'YES I PROMISE
'ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE SILENCE BEFORE DURING AND AFTER NO
REFERENCE TO THE MATTER AT ALL EITHER IN WORD OR WRITING
'I HAVE ALREADY GIVEN YOU MY WORD
'VERY GOOD HE SUDDENLY SPRANG UP AND DARTING LIKE LIGHTNING
ACROSS THE ROOM HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR
THE PASSAGE OUTSIDE WAS
EMPTY
'THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID HE COMING BACK
'I KNOW THAT CLERKS ARE
SOMETIMES CURIOUS AS TO THEIR MASTER'S AFFAIRS
NOW WE CAN TALK
IN SAFETY HE DREW UP HIS CHAIR VERY CLOSE TO MINE AND BEGAN TO
STARE AT ME AGAIN WITH THE SAME QUESTIONING AND THOUGHTFUL LOOK
A FEELING OF REPULSION AND OF SOMETHING AKIN TO FEAR HAD BEGUN
TO RISE WITHIN ME AT THE STRANGE ANTICS OF THIS FLESHLESS MAN
EVEN MY DREAD OF LOSING A CLIENT COULD NOT RESTRAIN ME FROM
SHOWING MY IMPATIENCE
'I BEG THAT YOU WILL STATE YOUR BUSINESS SIR SAID I 'MY TIME
IS OF VALUE HEAVEN FORGIVE ME FOR THAT LAST SENTENCE BUT THE
WORDS CAME TO MY LIPS
'HOW WOULD FIFTY GUINEAS FOR A NIGHT'S WORK SUIT YOU HE ASKED
'MOST ADMIRABLY
'I SAY A NIGHT'S WORK BUT AN HOUR'S WOULD BE NEARER THE MARK
I
SIMPLY WANT YOUR OPINION ABOUT A HYDRAULIC STAMPING MACHINE WHICH
HAS GOT OUT OF GEAR
IF YOU SHOW US WHAT IS WRONG WE SHALL SOON
SET IT RIGHT OURSELVES
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF SUCH A COMMISSION AS
THAT
'THE WORK APPEARS TO BE LIGHT AND THE PAY MUNIFICENT
'PRECISELY SO
WE SHALL WANT YOU TO COME TO NIGHT BY THE LAST
TRAIN
'WHERE TO
'TO EYFORD IN BERKSHIRE
IT IS A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE BORDERS
OF OXFORDSHIRE AND WITHIN SEVEN MILES OF READING
THERE IS A
TRAIN FROM PADDINGTON WHICH WOULD BRING YOU THERE AT ABOUT
11 15
'VERY GOOD
'I SHALL COME DOWN IN A CARRIAGE TO MEET YOU
'THERE IS A DRIVE THEN
'YES OUR LITTLE PLACE IS QUITE OUT IN THE COUNTRY
IT IS A GOOD
SEVEN MILES FROM EYFORD STATION
'THEN WE CAN HARDLY GET THERE BEFORE MIDNIGHT
I SUPPOSE THERE
WOULD BE NO CHANCE OF A TRAIN BACK
I SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO STOP
THE NIGHT
'YES WE COULD EASILY GIVE YOU A SHAKE DOWN
'THAT IS VERY AWKWARD
COULD I NOT COME AT SOME MORE CONVENIENT
HOUR
'WE HAVE JUDGED IT BEST THAT YOU SHOULD COME LATE
IT IS TO
RECOMPENSE YOU FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THAT WE ARE PAYING TO YOU A
YOUNG AND UNKNOWN MAN A FEE WHICH WOULD BUY AN OPINION FROM THE
VERY HEADS OF YOUR PROFESSION
STILL OF COURSE IF YOU WOULD
LIKE TO DRAW OUT OF THE BUSINESS THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME TO DO
SO
I THOUGHT OF THE FIFTY GUINEAS AND OF HOW VERY USEFUL THEY
WOULD BE TO ME
'NOT AT ALL SAID I 'I SHALL BE VERY HAPPY TO
ACCOMMODATE MYSELF TO YOUR WISHES
I SHOULD LIKE HOWEVER TO
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WISH ME TO
DO
'QUITE SO
IT IS VERY NATURAL THAT THE PLEDGE OF SECRECY WHICH
WE HAVE EXACTED FROM YOU SHOULD HAVE AROUSED YOUR CURIOSITY
I
HAVE NO WISH TO COMMIT YOU TO ANYTHING WITHOUT YOUR HAVING IT ALL
LAID BEFORE YOU
I SUPPOSE THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE FROM
EAVESDROPPERS
'ENTIRELY
'THEN THE MATTER STANDS THUS
YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE THAT
FULLER'S EARTH IS A VALUABLE PRODUCT AND THAT IT IS ONLY FOUND
IN ONE OR TWO PLACES IN ENGLAND
'I HAVE HEARD SO
'SOME LITTLE TIME AGO I BOUGHT A SMALL PLACE A VERY SMALL
PLACE WITHIN TEN MILES OF READING
I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO
DISCOVER THAT THERE WAS A DEPOSIT OF FULLER'S EARTH IN ONE OF MY
FIELDS
ON EXAMINING IT HOWEVER I FOUND THAT THIS DEPOSIT WAS A
COMPARATIVELY SMALL ONE AND THAT IT FORMED A LINK BETWEEN TWO
VERY MUCH LARGER ONES UPON THE RIGHT AND LEFT BOTH OF THEM
HOWEVER IN THE GROUNDS OF MY NEIGHBOURS
THESE GOOD PEOPLE WERE
ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT THAT THEIR LAND CONTAINED THAT WHICH WAS
QUITE AS VALUABLE AS A GOLD MINE
NATURALLY IT WAS TO MY
INTEREST TO BUY THEIR LAND BEFORE THEY DISCOVERED ITS TRUE VALUE
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAD NO CAPITAL BY WHICH I COULD DO THIS
I
TOOK A FEW OF MY FRIENDS INTO THE SECRET HOWEVER AND THEY
SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD QUIETLY AND SECRETLY WORK OUR OWN LITTLE
DEPOSIT AND THAT IN THIS WAY WE SHOULD EARN THE MONEY WHICH WOULD
ENABLE US TO BUY THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS
THIS WE HAVE NOW BEEN
DOING FOR SOME TIME AND IN ORDER TO HELP US IN OUR OPERATIONS WE
ERECTED A HYDRAULIC PRESS
THIS PRESS AS I HAVE ALREADY
EXPLAINED HAS GOT OUT OF ORDER AND WE WISH YOUR ADVICE UPON THE
SUBJECT
WE GUARD OUR SECRET VERY JEALOUSLY HOWEVER AND IF IT
ONCE BECAME KNOWN THAT WE HAD HYDRAULIC ENGINEERS COMING TO OUR
LITTLE HOUSE IT WOULD SOON ROUSE INQUIRY AND THEN IF THE FACTS
CAME OUT IT WOULD BE GOOD BYE TO ANY CHANCE OF GETTING THESE
FIELDS AND CARRYING OUT OUR PLANS
THAT IS WHY I HAVE MADE YOU
PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL NOT TELL A HUMAN BEING THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO EYFORD TO NIGHT
I HOPE THAT I MAKE IT ALL PLAIN
'I QUITE FOLLOW YOU SAID I
'THE ONLY POINT WHICH I COULD NOT
QUITE UNDERSTAND WAS WHAT USE YOU COULD MAKE OF A HYDRAULIC PRESS
IN EXCAVATING FULLER'S EARTH WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IS DUG OUT
LIKE GRAVEL FROM A PIT
'AH SAID HE CARELESSLY 'WE HAVE OUR OWN PROCESS
WE COMPRESS
THE EARTH INTO BRICKS SO AS TO REMOVE THEM WITHOUT REVEALING
WHAT THEY ARE
BUT THAT IS A MERE DETAIL
I HAVE TAKEN YOU FULLY
INTO MY CONFIDENCE NOW MR
HATHERLEY AND I HAVE SHOWN YOU HOW I
TRUST YOU HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE
'I SHALL EXPECT YOU THEN AT
EYFORD AT 11 15
'I SHALL CERTAINLY BE THERE
'AND NOT A WORD TO A SOUL HE LOOKED AT ME WITH A LAST LONG
QUESTIONING GAZE AND THEN PRESSING MY HAND IN A COLD DANK
GRASP HE HURRIED FROM THE ROOM
WELL WHEN I CAME TO THINK IT ALL OVER IN COOL BLOOD I WAS VERY
MUCH ASTONISHED AS YOU MAY BOTH THINK AT THIS SUDDEN COMMISSION
WHICH HAD BEEN INTRUSTED TO ME
ON THE ONE HAND OF COURSE I WAS
GLAD FOR THE FEE WAS AT LEAST TENFOLD WHAT I SHOULD HAVE ASKED
HAD I SET A PRICE UPON MY OWN SERVICES AND IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT
THIS ORDER MIGHT LEAD TO OTHER ONES
ON THE OTHER HAND THE FACE
AND MANNER OF MY PATRON HAD MADE AN UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION UPON
ME AND I COULD NOT THINK THAT HIS EXPLANATION OF THE
FULLER'S EARTH WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE NECESSITY FOR MY
COMING AT MIDNIGHT AND HIS EXTREME ANXIETY LEST I SHOULD TELL
ANYONE OF MY ERRAND
HOWEVER I THREW ALL FEARS TO THE WINDS ATE
A HEARTY SUPPER DROVE TO PADDINGTON AND STARTED OFF HAVING
OBEYED TO THE LETTER THE INJUNCTION AS TO HOLDING MY TONGUE
AT READING I HAD TO CHANGE NOT ONLY MY CARRIAGE BUT MY STATION
HOWEVER I WAS IN TIME FOR THE LAST TRAIN TO EYFORD AND I
REACHED THE LITTLE DIM LIT STATION AFTER ELEVEN O'CLOCK
I WAS THE
ONLY PASSENGER WHO GOT OUT THERE AND THERE WAS NO ONE UPON THE
PLATFORM SAVE A SINGLE SLEEPY PORTER WITH A LANTERN
AS I PASSED
OUT THROUGH THE WICKET GATE HOWEVER I FOUND MY ACQUAINTANCE OF
THE MORNING WAITING IN THE SHADOW UPON THE OTHER SIDE
WITHOUT A
WORD HE GRASPED MY ARM AND HURRIED ME INTO A CARRIAGE THE DOOR
OF WHICH WAS STANDING OPEN
HE DREW UP THE WINDOWS ON EITHER
SIDE TAPPED ON THE WOOD WORK AND AWAY WE WENT AS FAST AS THE
HORSE COULD GO
ONE HORSE INTERJECTED HOLMES
YES ONLY ONE
DID YOU OBSERVE THE COLOUR
YES I SAW IT BY THE SIDE LIGHTS WHEN I WAS STEPPING INTO THE
CARRIAGE
IT WAS A CHESTNUT
TIRED LOOKING OR FRESH
OH FRESH AND GLOSSY
THANK YOU
I AM SORRY TO HAVE INTERRUPTED YOU
PRAY CONTINUE
YOUR MOST INTERESTING STATEMENT
AWAY WE WENT THEN AND WE DROVE FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR
COLONEL
LYSANDER STARK HAD SAID THAT IT WAS ONLY SEVEN MILES BUT I
SHOULD THINK FROM THE RATE THAT WE SEEMED TO GO AND FROM THE
TIME THAT WE TOOK THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARER TWELVE
HE SAT
AT MY SIDE IN SILENCE ALL THE TIME AND I WAS AWARE MORE THAN
ONCE WHEN I GLANCED IN HIS DIRECTION THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT ME
WITH GREAT INTENSITY
THE COUNTRY ROADS SEEM TO BE NOT VERY GOOD
IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD FOR WE LURCHED AND JOLTED TERRIBLY
I
TRIED TO LOOK OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO SEE SOMETHING OF WHERE WE
WERE BUT THEY WERE MADE OF FROSTED GLASS AND I COULD MAKE OUT
NOTHING SAVE THE OCCASIONAL BRIGHT BLUR OF A PASSING LIGHT
NOW
AND THEN I HAZARDED SOME REMARK TO BREAK THE MONOTONY OF THE
JOURNEY BUT THE COLONEL ANSWERED ONLY IN MONOSYLLABLES AND THE
CONVERSATION SOON FLAGGED
AT LAST HOWEVER THE BUMPING OF THE
ROAD WAS EXCHANGED FOR THE CRISP SMOOTHNESS OF A GRAVEL DRIVE
AND THE CARRIAGE CAME TO A STAND
COLONEL LYSANDER STARK SPRANG
OUT AND AS I FOLLOWED AFTER HIM PULLED ME SWIFTLY INTO A PORCH
WHICH GAPED IN FRONT OF US
WE STEPPED AS IT WERE RIGHT OUT OF
THE CARRIAGE AND INTO THE HALL SO THAT I FAILED TO CATCH THE
MOST FLEETING GLANCE OF THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE
THE INSTANT THAT
I HAD CROSSED THE THRESHOLD THE DOOR SLAMMED HEAVILY BEHIND US
AND I HEARD FAINTLY THE RATTLE OF THE WHEELS AS THE CARRIAGE
DROVE AWAY
IT WAS PITCH DARK INSIDE THE HOUSE AND THE COLONEL FUMBLED
ABOUT LOOKING FOR MATCHES AND MUTTERING UNDER HIS BREATH
SUDDENLY A DOOR OPENED AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE AND A
LONG GOLDEN BAR OF LIGHT SHOT OUT IN OUR DIRECTION
IT GREW
BROADER AND A WOMAN APPEARED WITH A LAMP IN HER HAND WHICH SHE
HELD ABOVE HER HEAD PUSHING HER FACE FORWARD AND PEERING AT US
I COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS PRETTY AND FROM THE GLOSS WITH WHICH
THE LIGHT SHONE UPON HER DARK DRESS I KNEW THAT IT WAS A RICH
MATERIAL
SHE SPOKE A FEW WORDS IN A FOREIGN TONGUE IN A TONE AS
THOUGH ASKING A QUESTION AND WHEN MY COMPANION ANSWERED IN A
GRUFF MONOSYLLABLE SHE GAVE SUCH A START THAT THE LAMP NEARLY
FELL FROM HER HAND
COLONEL STARK WENT UP TO HER WHISPERED
SOMETHING IN HER EAR AND THEN PUSHING HER BACK INTO THE ROOM
FROM WHENCE SHE HAD COME HE WALKED TOWARDS ME AGAIN WITH THE
LAMP IN HIS HAND
'PERHAPS YOU WILL HAVE THE KINDNESS TO WAIT IN THIS ROOM FOR A
FEW MINUTES SAID HE THROWING OPEN ANOTHER DOOR
IT WAS A
QUIET LITTLE PLAINLY FURNISHED ROOM WITH A ROUND TABLE IN THE
CENTRE ON WHICH SEVERAL GERMAN BOOKS WERE SCATTERED
COLONEL
STARK LAID DOWN THE LAMP ON THE TOP OF A HARMONIUM BESIDE THE
DOOR
'I SHALL NOT KEEP YOU WAITING AN INSTANT SAID HE AND
VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS
I GLANCED AT THE BOOKS UPON THE TABLE AND IN SPITE OF MY
IGNORANCE OF GERMAN I COULD SEE THAT TWO OF THEM WERE TREATISES
ON SCIENCE THE OTHERS BEING VOLUMES OF POETRY
THEN I WALKED
ACROSS TO THE WINDOW HOPING THAT I MIGHT CATCH SOME GLIMPSE OF
THE COUNTRY SIDE BUT AN OAK SHUTTER HEAVILY BARRED WAS FOLDED
ACROSS IT
IT WAS A WONDERFULLY SILENT HOUSE
THERE WAS AN OLD
CLOCK TICKING LOUDLY SOMEWHERE IN THE PASSAGE BUT OTHERWISE
EVERYTHING WAS DEADLY STILL
A VAGUE FEELING OF UNEASINESS BEGAN
TO STEAL OVER ME
WHO WERE THESE GERMAN PEOPLE AND WHAT WERE
THEY DOING LIVING IN THIS STRANGE OUT OF THE WAY PLACE AND
WHERE WAS THE PLACE I WAS TEN MILES OR SO FROM EYFORD THAT WAS
ALL I KNEW BUT WHETHER NORTH SOUTH EAST OR WEST I HAD NO
IDEA
FOR THAT MATTER READING AND POSSIBLY OTHER LARGE TOWNS
WERE WITHIN THAT RADIUS SO THE PLACE MIGHT NOT BE SO SECLUDED
AFTER ALL
YET IT WAS QUITE CERTAIN FROM THE ABSOLUTE STILLNESS
THAT WE WERE IN THE COUNTRY
I PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
HUMMING A TUNE UNDER MY BREATH TO KEEP UP MY SPIRITS AND FEELING
THAT I WAS THOROUGHLY EARNING MY FIFTY GUINEA FEE
SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY SOUND IN THE MIDST OF THE
UTTER STILLNESS THE DOOR OF MY ROOM SWUNG SLOWLY OPEN
THE WOMAN
WAS STANDING IN THE APERTURE THE DARKNESS OF THE HALL BEHIND
HER THE YELLOW LIGHT FROM MY LAMP BEATING UPON HER EAGER AND
BEAUTIFUL FACE
I COULD SEE AT A GLANCE THAT SHE WAS SICK WITH
FEAR AND THE SIGHT SENT A CHILL TO MY OWN HEART
SHE HELD UP ONE
SHAKING FINGER TO WARN ME TO BE SILENT AND SHE SHOT A FEW
WHISPERED WORDS OF BROKEN ENGLISH AT ME HER EYES GLANCING BACK
LIKE THOSE OF A FRIGHTENED HORSE INTO THE GLOOM BEHIND HER
'I WOULD GO SAID SHE TRYING HARD AS IT SEEMED TO ME TO
SPEAK CALMLY 'I WOULD GO
I SHOULD NOT STAY HERE
THERE IS NO
GOOD FOR YOU TO DO
'BUT MADAM SAID I 'I HAVE NOT YET DONE WHAT I CAME FOR
I
CANNOT POSSIBLY LEAVE UNTIL I HAVE SEEN THE MACHINE
'IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR WHILE TO WAIT SHE WENT ON
'YOU CAN PASS
THROUGH THE DOOR NO ONE HINDERS AND THEN SEEING THAT I SMILED
AND SHOOK MY HEAD SHE SUDDENLY THREW ASIDE HER CONSTRAINT AND
MADE A STEP FORWARD WITH HER HANDS WRUNG TOGETHER
'FOR THE LOVE
OF HEAVEN SHE WHISPERED 'GET AWAY FROM HERE BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE
BUT I AM SOMEWHAT HEADSTRONG BY NATURE AND THE MORE READY TO
ENGAGE IN AN AFFAIR WHEN THERE IS SOME OBSTACLE IN THE WAY
I
THOUGHT OF MY FIFTY GUINEA FEE OF MY WEARISOME JOURNEY AND OF
THE UNPLEASANT NIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO BE BEFORE ME
WAS IT ALL TO
GO FOR NOTHING WHY SHOULD I SLINK AWAY WITHOUT HAVING CARRIED
OUT MY COMMISSION AND WITHOUT THE PAYMENT WHICH WAS MY DUE THIS
WOMAN MIGHT FOR ALL I KNEW BE A MONOMANIAC
WITH A STOUT
BEARING THEREFORE THOUGH HER MANNER HAD SHAKEN ME MORE THAN I
CARED TO CONFESS I STILL SHOOK MY HEAD AND DECLARED MY INTENTION
OF REMAINING WHERE I WAS
SHE WAS ABOUT TO RENEW HER ENTREATIES
WHEN A DOOR SLAMMED OVERHEAD AND THE SOUND OF SEVERAL FOOTSTEPS
WAS HEARD UPON THE STAIRS
SHE LISTENED FOR AN INSTANT THREW UP
HER HANDS WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE AND VANISHED AS SUDDENLY AND
AS NOISELESSLY AS SHE HAD COME
THE NEWCOMERS WERE COLONEL LYSANDER STARK AND A SHORT THICK MAN
WITH A CHINCHILLA BEARD GROWING OUT OF THE CREASES OF HIS DOUBLE
CHIN WHO WAS INTRODUCED TO ME AS MR
FERGUSON
'THIS IS MY SECRETARY AND MANAGER SAID THE COLONEL
'BY THE
WAY I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT I LEFT THIS DOOR SHUT JUST
NOW
I FEAR THAT YOU HAVE FELT THE DRAUGHT
'ON THE CONTRARY SAID I 'I OPENED THE DOOR MYSELF BECAUSE I
FELT THE ROOM TO BE A LITTLE CLOSE
HE SHOT ONE OF HIS SUSPICIOUS LOOKS AT ME
'PERHAPS WE HAD
BETTER PROCEED TO BUSINESS THEN SAID HE
'MR
FERGUSON AND I
WILL TAKE YOU UP TO SEE THE MACHINE
'I HAD BETTER PUT MY HAT ON I SUPPOSE
'OH NO IT IS IN THE HOUSE
'WHAT YOU DIG FULLER'S EARTH IN THE HOUSE
'NO NO
THIS IS ONLY WHERE WE COMPRESS IT
BUT NEVER MIND THAT
ALL WE WISH YOU TO DO IS TO EXAMINE THE MACHINE AND TO LET US
KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT
WE WENT UPSTAIRS TOGETHER THE COLONEL FIRST WITH THE LAMP THE
FAT MANAGER AND I BEHIND HIM
IT WAS A LABYRINTH OF AN OLD HOUSE
WITH CORRIDORS PASSAGES NARROW WINDING STAIRCASES AND LITTLE
LOW DOORS THE THRESHOLDS OF WHICH WERE HOLLOWED OUT BY THE
GENERATIONS WHO HAD CROSSED THEM
THERE WERE NO CARPETS AND NO
SIGNS OF ANY FURNITURE ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR WHILE THE PLASTER
WAS PEELING OFF THE WALLS AND THE DAMP WAS BREAKING THROUGH IN
GREEN UNHEALTHY BLOTCHES
I TRIED TO PUT ON AS UNCONCERNED AN
AIR AS POSSIBLE BUT I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE WARNINGS OF THE
LADY EVEN THOUGH I DISREGARDED THEM AND I KEPT A KEEN EYE UPON
MY TWO COMPANIONS
FERGUSON APPEARED TO BE A MOROSE AND SILENT
MAN BUT I COULD SEE FROM THE LITTLE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS AT
LEAST A FELLOW COUNTRYMAN
COLONEL LYSANDER STARK STOPPED AT LAST BEFORE A LOW DOOR WHICH
HE UNLOCKED
WITHIN WAS A SMALL SQUARE ROOM IN WHICH THE THREE
OF US COULD HARDLY GET AT ONE TIME
FERGUSON REMAINED OUTSIDE
AND THE COLONEL USHERED ME IN
'WE ARE NOW SAID HE 'ACTUALLY WITHIN THE HYDRAULIC PRESS AND
IT WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY UNPLEASANT THING FOR US IF ANYONE WERE
TO TURN IT ON
THE CEILING OF THIS SMALL CHAMBER IS REALLY THE
END OF THE DESCENDING PISTON AND IT COMES DOWN WITH THE FORCE OF
MANY TONS UPON THIS METAL FLOOR
THERE ARE SMALL LATERAL COLUMNS
OF WATER OUTSIDE WHICH RECEIVE THE FORCE AND WHICH TRANSMIT AND
MULTIPLY IT IN THE MANNER WHICH IS FAMILIAR TO YOU
THE MACHINE
GOES READILY ENOUGH BUT THERE IS SOME STIFFNESS IN THE WORKING
OF IT AND IT HAS LOST A LITTLE OF ITS FORCE
PERHAPS YOU WILL
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO LOOK IT OVER AND TO SHOW US HOW WE CAN SET
IT RIGHT
I TOOK THE LAMP FROM HIM AND I EXAMINED THE MACHINE VERY
THOROUGHLY
IT WAS INDEED A GIGANTIC ONE AND CAPABLE OF
EXERCISING ENORMOUS PRESSURE
WHEN I PASSED OUTSIDE HOWEVER AND
PRESSED DOWN THE LEVERS WHICH CONTROLLED IT I KNEW AT ONCE BY
THE WHISHING SOUND THAT THERE WAS A SLIGHT LEAKAGE WHICH ALLOWED
A REGURGITATION OF WATER THROUGH ONE OF THE SIDE CYLINDERS
AN
EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT ONE OF THE INDIA RUBBER BANDS WHICH WAS
ROUND THE HEAD OF A DRIVING ROD HAD SHRUNK SO AS NOT QUITE TO
FILL THE SOCKET ALONG WHICH IT WORKED
THIS WAS CLEARLY THE CAUSE
OF THE LOSS OF POWER AND I POINTED IT OUT TO MY COMPANIONS WHO
FOLLOWED MY REMARKS VERY CAREFULLY AND ASKED SEVERAL PRACTICAL
QUESTIONS AS TO HOW THEY SHOULD PROCEED TO SET IT RIGHT
WHEN I
HAD MADE IT CLEAR TO THEM I RETURNED TO THE MAIN CHAMBER OF THE
MACHINE AND TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT IT TO SATISFY MY OWN CURIOSITY
IT WAS OBVIOUS AT A GLANCE THAT THE STORY OF THE FULLER'S EARTH
WAS THE MEREST FABRICATION FOR IT WOULD BE ABSURD TO SUPPOSE
THAT SO POWERFUL AN ENGINE COULD BE DESIGNED FOR SO INADEQUATE A
PURPOSE
THE WALLS WERE OF WOOD BUT THE FLOOR CONSISTED OF A
LARGE IRON TROUGH AND WHEN I CAME TO EXAMINE IT I COULD SEE A
CRUST OF METALLIC DEPOSIT ALL OVER IT
I HAD STOOPED AND WAS
SCRAPING AT THIS TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS WHEN I HEARD A
MUTTERED EXCLAMATION IN GERMAN AND SAW THE CADAVEROUS FACE OF THE
COLONEL LOOKING DOWN AT ME
'WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE HE ASKED
I FELT ANGRY AT HAVING BEEN TRICKED BY SO ELABORATE A STORY AS
THAT WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME
'I WAS ADMIRING YOUR FULLER'S EARTH
SAID I 'I THINK THAT I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ADVISE YOU AS TO
YOUR MACHINE IF I KNEW WHAT THE EXACT PURPOSE WAS FOR WHICH IT
WAS USED
THE INSTANT THAT I UTTERED THE WORDS I REGRETTED THE RASHNESS OF
MY SPEECH
HIS FACE SET HARD AND A BALEFUL LIGHT SPRANG UP IN
HIS GREY EYES
'VERY WELL SAID HE 'YOU SHALL KNOW ALL ABOUT THE MACHINE HE
TOOK A STEP BACKWARD SLAMMED THE LITTLE DOOR AND TURNED THE KEY
IN THE LOCK
I RUSHED TOWARDS IT AND PULLED AT THE HANDLE BUT IT
WAS QUITE SECURE AND DID NOT GIVE IN THE LEAST TO MY KICKS AND
SHOVES
'HULLO I YELLED
'HULLO COLONEL LET ME OUT
AND THEN SUDDENLY IN THE SILENCE I HEARD A SOUND WHICH SENT MY
HEART INTO MY MOUTH
IT WAS THE CLANK OF THE LEVERS AND THE SWISH
OF THE LEAKING CYLINDER
HE HAD SET THE ENGINE AT WORK
THE LAMP
STILL STOOD UPON THE FLOOR WHERE I HAD PLACED IT WHEN EXAMINING
THE TROUGH
BY ITS LIGHT I SAW THAT THE BLACK CEILING WAS COMING
DOWN UPON ME SLOWLY JERKILY BUT AS NONE KNEW BETTER THAN
MYSELF WITH A FORCE WHICH MUST WITHIN A MINUTE GRIND ME TO A
SHAPELESS PULP
I THREW MYSELF SCREAMING AGAINST THE DOOR AND
DRAGGED WITH MY NAILS AT THE LOCK
I IMPLORED THE COLONEL TO LET
ME OUT BUT THE REMORSELESS CLANKING OF THE LEVERS DROWNED MY
CRIES
THE CEILING WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE MY HEAD AND WITH
MY HAND UPRAISED I COULD FEEL ITS HARD ROUGH SURFACE
THEN IT
FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND THAT THE PAIN OF MY DEATH WOULD DEPEND
VERY MUCH UPON THE POSITION IN WHICH I MET IT
IF I LAY ON MY
FACE THE WEIGHT WOULD COME UPON MY SPINE AND I SHUDDERED TO
THINK OF THAT DREADFUL SNAP
EASIER THE OTHER WAY PERHAPS AND
YET HAD I THE NERVE TO LIE AND LOOK UP AT THAT DEADLY BLACK
SHADOW WAVERING DOWN UPON ME ALREADY I WAS UNABLE TO STAND
ERECT WHEN MY EYE CAUGHT SOMETHING WHICH BROUGHT A GUSH OF HOPE
BACK TO MY HEART
I HAVE SAID THAT THOUGH THE FLOOR AND CEILING WERE OF IRON THE
WALLS WERE OF WOOD
AS I GAVE A LAST HURRIED GLANCE AROUND I SAW
A THIN LINE OF YELLOW LIGHT BETWEEN TWO OF THE BOARDS WHICH
BROADENED AND BROADENED AS A SMALL PANEL WAS PUSHED BACKWARD
FOR
AN INSTANT I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT HERE WAS INDEED A DOOR
WHICH LED AWAY FROM DEATH
THE NEXT INSTANT I THREW MYSELF
THROUGH AND LAY HALF FAINTING UPON THE OTHER SIDE
THE PANEL HAD
CLOSED AGAIN BEHIND ME BUT THE CRASH OF THE LAMP AND A FEW
MOMENTS AFTERWARDS THE CLANG OF THE TWO SLABS OF METAL TOLD ME
HOW NARROW HAD BEEN MY ESCAPE
I WAS RECALLED TO MYSELF BY A FRANTIC PLUCKING AT MY WRIST AND
I FOUND MYSELF LYING UPON THE STONE FLOOR OF A NARROW CORRIDOR
WHILE A WOMAN BENT OVER ME AND TUGGED AT ME WITH HER LEFT HAND
WHILE SHE HELD A CANDLE IN HER RIGHT
IT WAS THE SAME GOOD FRIEND
WHOSE WARNING I HAD SO FOOLISHLY REJECTED
'COME COME SHE CRIED BREATHLESSLY
'THEY WILL BE HERE IN A
MOMENT
THEY WILL SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT THERE
OH DO NOT WASTE
THE SO PRECIOUS TIME BUT COME
THIS TIME AT LEAST I DID NOT SCORN HER ADVICE
I STAGGERED TO
MY FEET AND RAN WITH HER ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND DOWN A WINDING
STAIR
THE LATTER LED TO ANOTHER BROAD PASSAGE AND JUST AS WE
REACHED IT WE HEARD THE SOUND OF RUNNING FEET AND THE SHOUTING OF
TWO VOICES ONE ANSWERING THE OTHER FROM THE FLOOR ON WHICH WE
WERE AND FROM THE ONE BENEATH
MY GUIDE STOPPED AND LOOKED ABOUT
HER LIKE ONE WHO IS AT HER WIT'S END
THEN SHE THREW OPEN A DOOR
WHICH LED INTO A BEDROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF WHICH THE MOON
WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY
'IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE SAID SHE
'IT IS HIGH BUT IT MAY BE
THAT YOU CAN JUMP IT
AS SHE SPOKE A LIGHT SPRANG INTO VIEW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE
PASSAGE AND I SAW THE LEAN FIGURE OF COLONEL LYSANDER STARK
RUSHING FORWARD WITH A LANTERN IN ONE HAND AND A WEAPON LIKE A
BUTCHER'S CLEAVER IN THE OTHER
I RUSHED ACROSS THE BEDROOM
FLUNG OPEN THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT
HOW QUIET AND SWEET AND
WHOLESOME THE GARDEN LOOKED IN THE MOONLIGHT AND IT COULD NOT BE
MORE THAN THIRTY FEET DOWN
I CLAMBERED OUT UPON THE SILL BUT I
HESITATED TO JUMP UNTIL I SHOULD HAVE HEARD WHAT PASSED BETWEEN
MY SAVIOUR AND THE RUFFIAN WHO PURSUED ME
IF SHE WERE ILL USED
THEN AT ANY RISKS I WAS DETERMINED TO GO BACK TO HER ASSISTANCE
THE THOUGHT HAD HARDLY FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND BEFORE HE WAS AT
THE DOOR PUSHING HIS WAY PAST HER BUT SHE THREW HER ARMS ROUND
HIM AND TRIED TO HOLD HIM BACK
'FRITZ FRITZ SHE CRIED IN ENGLISH 'REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE
AFTER THE LAST TIME
YOU SAID IT SHOULD NOT BE AGAIN
HE WILL BE
SILENT OH HE WILL BE SILENT
'YOU ARE MAD ELISE HE SHOUTED STRUGGLING TO BREAK AWAY FROM
HER
'YOU WILL BE THE RUIN OF US
HE HAS SEEN TOO MUCH
LET ME
PASS I SAY HE DASHED HER TO ONE SIDE AND RUSHING TO THE
WINDOW CUT AT ME WITH HIS HEAVY WEAPON
I HAD LET MYSELF GO AND
WAS HANGING BY THE HANDS TO THE SILL WHEN HIS BLOW FELL
I WAS
CONSCIOUS OF A DULL PAIN MY GRIP LOOSENED AND I FELL INTO THE
GARDEN BELOW
I WAS SHAKEN BUT NOT HURT BY THE FALL SO I PICKED MYSELF UP AND
RUSHED OFF AMONG THE BUSHES AS HARD AS I COULD RUN FOR I
UNDERSTOOD THAT I WAS FAR FROM BEING OUT OF DANGER YET
SUDDENLY
HOWEVER AS I RAN A DEADLY DIZZINESS AND SICKNESS CAME OVER ME
I GLANCED DOWN AT MY HAND WHICH WAS THROBBING PAINFULLY AND
THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THAT MY THUMB HAD BEEN CUT OFF AND
THAT THE BLOOD WAS POURING FROM MY WOUND
I ENDEAVOURED TO TIE MY
HANDKERCHIEF ROUND IT BUT THERE CAME A SUDDEN BUZZING IN MY
EARS AND NEXT MOMENT I FELL IN A DEAD FAINT AMONG THE
ROSE BUSHES
HOW LONG I REMAINED UNCONSCIOUS I CANNOT TELL
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A VERY LONG TIME FOR THE MOON HAD SUNK AND A BRIGHT MORNING WAS
BREAKING WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF
MY CLOTHES WERE ALL SODDEN WITH
DEW AND MY COAT SLEEVE WAS DRENCHED WITH BLOOD FROM MY WOUNDED
THUMB
THE SMARTING OF IT RECALLED IN AN INSTANT ALL THE
PARTICULARS OF MY NIGHT'S ADVENTURE AND I SPRANG TO MY FEET WITH
THE FEELING THAT I MIGHT HARDLY YET BE SAFE FROM MY PURSUERS
BUT
TO MY ASTONISHMENT WHEN I CAME TO LOOK ROUND ME NEITHER HOUSE
NOR GARDEN WERE TO BE SEEN
I HAD BEEN LYING IN AN ANGLE OF THE
HEDGE CLOSE BY THE HIGHROAD AND JUST A LITTLE LOWER DOWN WAS A
LONG BUILDING WHICH PROVED UPON MY APPROACHING IT TO BE THE
VERY STATION AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED UPON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
WERE
IT NOT FOR THE UGLY WOUND UPON MY HAND ALL THAT HAD PASSED
DURING THOSE DREADFUL HOURS MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EVIL DREAM
HALF DAZED I WENT INTO THE STATION AND ASKED ABOUT THE MORNING
TRAIN
THERE WOULD BE ONE TO READING IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
THE
SAME PORTER WAS ON DUTY I FOUND AS HAD BEEN THERE WHEN I
ARRIVED
I INQUIRED OF HIM WHETHER HE HAD EVER HEARD OF COLONEL
LYSANDER STARK
THE NAME WAS STRANGE TO HIM
HAD HE OBSERVED A
CARRIAGE THE NIGHT BEFORE WAITING FOR ME NO HE HAD NOT
WAS
THERE A POLICE STATION ANYWHERE NEAR THERE WAS ONE ABOUT THREE
MILES OFF
IT WAS TOO FAR FOR ME TO GO WEAK AND ILL AS I WAS
I DETERMINED
TO WAIT UNTIL I GOT BACK TO TOWN BEFORE TELLING MY STORY TO THE
POLICE
IT WAS A LITTLE PAST SIX WHEN I ARRIVED SO I WENT FIRST
TO HAVE MY WOUND DRESSED AND THEN THE DOCTOR WAS KIND ENOUGH TO
BRING ME ALONG HERE
I PUT THE CASE INTO YOUR HANDS AND SHALL DO
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ADVISE
WE BOTH SAT IN SILENCE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER LISTENING TO
THIS EXTRAORDINARY NARRATIVE
THEN SHERLOCK HOLMES PULLED DOWN
FROM THE SHELF ONE OF THE PONDEROUS COMMONPLACE BOOKS IN WHICH HE
PLACED HIS CUTTINGS
HERE IS AN ADVERTISEMENT WHICH WILL INTEREST YOU SAID HE
IT
APPEARED IN ALL THE PAPERS ABOUT A YEAR AGO
LISTEN TO THIS
'LOST ON THE 9TH INST MR
JEREMIAH HAYLING AGED
TWENTY SIX A HYDRAULIC ENGINEER
LEFT HIS LODGINGS AT TEN
O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND HAS NOT BEEN HEARD OF SINCE
WAS
DRESSED IN ETC ETC
HA THAT REPRESENTS THE LAST TIME THAT
THE COLONEL NEEDED TO HAVE HIS MACHINE OVERHAULED I FANCY
GOOD HEAVENS CRIED MY PATIENT
THEN THAT EXPLAINS WHAT THE
GIRL SAID
UNDOUBTEDLY
IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE COLONEL WAS A COOL AND
DESPERATE MAN WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED THAT NOTHING SHOULD
STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS LITTLE GAME LIKE THOSE OUT AND OUT
PIRATES WHO WILL LEAVE NO SURVIVOR FROM A CAPTURED SHIP
WELL
EVERY MOMENT NOW IS PRECIOUS SO IF YOU FEEL EQUAL TO IT WE SHALL
GO DOWN TO SCOTLAND YARD AT ONCE AS A PRELIMINARY TO STARTING FOR
EYFORD
SOME THREE HOURS OR SO AFTERWARDS WE WERE ALL IN THE TRAIN
TOGETHER BOUND FROM READING TO THE LITTLE BERKSHIRE VILLAGE
THERE WERE SHERLOCK HOLMES THE HYDRAULIC ENGINEER INSPECTOR
BRADSTREET OF SCOTLAND YARD A PLAIN CLOTHES MAN AND MYSELF
BRADSTREET HAD SPREAD AN ORDNANCE MAP OF THE COUNTY OUT UPON THE
SEAT AND WAS BUSY WITH HIS COMPASSES DRAWING A CIRCLE WITH EYFORD
FOR ITS CENTRE
THERE YOU ARE SAID HE
THAT CIRCLE IS DRAWN AT A RADIUS OF
TEN MILES FROM THE VILLAGE
THE PLACE WE WANT MUST BE SOMEWHERE
NEAR THAT LINE
YOU SAID TEN MILES I THINK SIR
IT WAS AN HOUR'S GOOD DRIVE
AND YOU THINK THAT THEY BROUGHT YOU BACK ALL THAT WAY WHEN YOU
WERE UNCONSCIOUS
THEY MUST HAVE DONE SO
I HAVE A CONFUSED MEMORY TOO OF HAVING
BEEN LIFTED AND CONVEYED SOMEWHERE
WHAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND SAID I IS WHY THEY SHOULD HAVE
SPARED YOU WHEN THEY FOUND YOU LYING FAINTING IN THE GARDEN
PERHAPS THE VILLAIN WAS SOFTENED BY THE WOMAN'S ENTREATIES
I HARDLY THINK THAT LIKELY
I NEVER SAW A MORE INEXORABLE FACE
IN MY LIFE
OH WE SHALL SOON CLEAR UP ALL THAT SAID BRADSTREET
WELL I
HAVE DRAWN MY CIRCLE AND I ONLY WISH I KNEW AT WHAT POINT UPON
IT THE FOLK THAT WE ARE IN SEARCH OF ARE TO BE FOUND
I THINK I COULD LAY MY FINGER ON IT SAID HOLMES QUIETLY
REALLY NOW CRIED THE INSPECTOR YOU HAVE FORMED YOUR
OPINION COME NOW WE SHALL SEE WHO AGREES WITH YOU
I SAY IT IS
SOUTH FOR THE COUNTRY IS MORE DESERTED THERE
AND I SAY EAST SAID MY PATIENT
I AM FOR WEST REMARKED THE PLAIN CLOTHES MAN
THERE ARE
SEVERAL QUIET LITTLE VILLAGES UP THERE
AND I AM FOR NORTH SAID I BECAUSE THERE ARE NO HILLS THERE
AND OUR FRIEND SAYS THAT HE DID NOT NOTICE THE CARRIAGE GO UP
ANY
COME CRIED THE INSPECTOR LAUGHING IT'S A VERY PRETTY
DIVERSITY OF OPINION
WE HAVE BOXED THE COMPASS AMONG US
WHO DO
YOU GIVE YOUR CASTING VOTE TO
YOU ARE ALL WRONG
BUT WE CAN'T ALL BE
OH YES YOU CAN
THIS IS MY POINT HE PLACED HIS FINGER IN THE
CENTRE OF THE CIRCLE
THIS IS WHERE WE SHALL FIND THEM
BUT THE TWELVE MILE DRIVE GASPED HATHERLEY
SIX OUT AND SIX BACK
NOTHING SIMPLER
YOU SAY YOURSELF THAT THE
HORSE WAS FRESH AND GLOSSY WHEN YOU GOT IN
HOW COULD IT BE THAT
IF IT HAD GONE TWELVE MILES OVER HEAVY ROADS
INDEED IT IS A LIKELY RUSE ENOUGH OBSERVED BRADSTREET
THOUGHTFULLY
OF COURSE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THE NATURE
OF THIS GANG
NONE AT ALL SAID HOLMES
THEY ARE COINERS ON A LARGE SCALE
AND HAVE USED THE MACHINE TO FORM THE AMALGAM WHICH HAS TAKEN THE
PLACE OF SILVER
WE HAVE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME THAT A CLEVER GANG WAS AT WORK
SAID THE INSPECTOR
THEY HAVE BEEN TURNING OUT HALF CROWNS BY
THE THOUSAND
WE EVEN TRACED THEM AS FAR AS READING BUT COULD
GET NO FARTHER FOR THEY HAD COVERED THEIR TRACES IN A WAY THAT
SHOWED THAT THEY WERE VERY OLD HANDS
BUT NOW THANKS TO THIS
LUCKY CHANCE I THINK THAT WE HAVE GOT THEM RIGHT ENOUGH
BUT THE INSPECTOR WAS MISTAKEN FOR THOSE CRIMINALS WERE NOT
DESTINED TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF JUSTICE
AS WE ROLLED INTO
EYFORD STATION WE SAW A GIGANTIC COLUMN OF SMOKE WHICH STREAMED
UP FROM BEHIND A SMALL CLUMP OF TREES IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND
HUNG LIKE AN IMMENSE OSTRICH FEATHER OVER THE LANDSCAPE
A HOUSE ON FIRE ASKED BRADSTREET AS THE TRAIN STEAMED OFF
AGAIN ON ITS WAY
YES SIR SAID THE STATION MASTER
WHEN DID IT BREAK OUT
I HEAR THAT IT WAS DURING THE NIGHT SIR BUT IT HAS GOT WORSE
AND THE WHOLE PLACE IS IN A BLAZE
WHOSE HOUSE IS IT
DR
BECHER'S
TELL ME BROKE IN THE ENGINEER IS DR
BECHER A GERMAN VERY
THIN WITH A LONG SHARP NOSE
THE STATION MASTER LAUGHED HEARTILY
NO SIR DR
BECHER IS AN
ENGLISHMAN AND THERE ISN'T A MAN IN THE PARISH WHO HAS A
BETTER LINED WAISTCOAT
BUT HE HAS A GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH HIM
A PATIENT AS I UNDERSTAND WHO IS A FOREIGNER AND HE LOOKS AS
IF A LITTLE GOOD BERKSHIRE BEEF WOULD DO HIM NO HARM
THE STATION MASTER HAD NOT FINISHED HIS SPEECH BEFORE WE WERE ALL
HASTENING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIRE
THE ROAD TOPPED A LOW
HILL AND THERE WAS A GREAT WIDESPREAD WHITEWASHED BUILDING IN
FRONT OF US SPOUTING FIRE AT EVERY CHINK AND WINDOW WHILE IN
THE GARDEN IN FRONT THREE FIRE ENGINES WERE VAINLY STRIVING TO
KEEP THE FLAMES UNDER
THAT'S IT CRIED HATHERLEY IN INTENSE EXCITEMENT
THERE IS
THE GRAVEL DRIVE AND THERE ARE THE ROSE BUSHES WHERE I LAY
THAT
SECOND WINDOW IS THE ONE THAT I JUMPED FROM
WELL AT LEAST SAID HOLMES YOU HAVE HAD YOUR REVENGE UPON
THEM
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT IT WAS YOUR OIL LAMP WHICH
WHEN IT WAS CRUSHED IN THE PRESS SET FIRE TO THE WOODEN WALLS
THOUGH NO DOUBT THEY WERE TOO EXCITED IN THE CHASE AFTER YOU TO
OBSERVE IT AT THE TIME
NOW KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN IN THIS CROWD FOR
YOUR FRIENDS OF LAST NIGHT THOUGH I VERY MUCH FEAR THAT THEY ARE
A GOOD HUNDRED MILES OFF BY NOW
AND HOLMES' FEARS CAME TO BE REALISED FOR FROM THAT DAY TO THIS
NO WORD HAS EVER BEEN HEARD EITHER OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THE
SINISTER GERMAN OR THE MOROSE ENGLISHMAN
EARLY THAT MORNING A
PEASANT HAD MET A CART CONTAINING SEVERAL PEOPLE AND SOME VERY
BULKY BOXES DRIVING RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION OF READING BUT
THERE ALL TRACES OF THE FUGITIVES DISAPPEARED AND EVEN HOLMES'
INGENUITY FAILED EVER TO DISCOVER THE LEAST CLUE AS TO THEIR
WHEREABOUTS
THE FIREMEN HAD BEEN MUCH PERTURBED AT THE STRANGE ARRANGEMENTS
WHICH THEY HAD FOUND WITHIN AND STILL MORE SO BY DISCOVERING A
NEWLY SEVERED HUMAN THUMB UPON A WINDOW SILL OF THE SECOND FLOOR
ABOUT SUNSET HOWEVER THEIR EFFORTS WERE AT LAST SUCCESSFUL AND
THEY SUBDUED THE FLAMES BUT NOT BEFORE THE ROOF HAD FALLEN IN
AND THE WHOLE PLACE BEEN REDUCED TO SUCH ABSOLUTE RUIN THAT SAVE
SOME TWISTED CYLINDERS AND IRON PIPING NOT A TRACE REMAINED OF
THE MACHINERY WHICH HAD COST OUR UNFORTUNATE ACQUAINTANCE SO
DEARLY
LARGE MASSES OF NICKEL AND OF TIN WERE DISCOVERED STORED
IN AN OUT HOUSE BUT NO COINS WERE TO BE FOUND WHICH MAY HAVE
EXPLAINED THE PRESENCE OF THOSE BULKY BOXES WHICH HAVE BEEN
ALREADY REFERRED TO
HOW OUR HYDRAULIC ENGINEER HAD BEEN CONVEYED FROM THE GARDEN TO
THE SPOT WHERE HE RECOVERED HIS SENSES MIGHT HAVE REMAINED
FOREVER A MYSTERY WERE IT NOT FOR THE SOFT MOULD WHICH TOLD US A
VERY PLAIN TALE
HE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CARRIED DOWN BY TWO
PERSONS ONE OF WHOM HAD REMARKABLY SMALL FEET AND THE OTHER
UNUSUALLY LARGE ONES
ON THE WHOLE IT WAS MOST PROBABLE THAT THE
SILENT ENGLISHMAN BEING LESS BOLD OR LESS MURDEROUS THAN HIS
COMPANION HAD ASSISTED THE WOMAN TO BEAR THE UNCONSCIOUS MAN OUT
OF THE WAY OF DANGER
WELL SAID OUR ENGINEER RUEFULLY AS WE TOOK OUR SEATS TO RETURN
ONCE MORE TO LONDON IT HAS BEEN A PRETTY BUSINESS FOR ME I
HAVE LOST MY THUMB AND I HAVE LOST A FIFTY GUINEA FEE AND WHAT
HAVE I GAINED
EXPERIENCE SAID HOLMES LAUGHING
INDIRECTLY IT MAY BE OF
VALUE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ONLY TO PUT IT INTO WORDS TO GAIN THE
REPUTATION OF BEING EXCELLENT COMPANY FOR THE REMAINDER OF YOUR
EXISTENCE
X
THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
THE LORD ST
SIMON MARRIAGE AND ITS CURIOUS TERMINATION HAVE
LONG CEASED TO BE A SUBJECT OF INTEREST IN THOSE EXALTED CIRCLES
IN WHICH THE UNFORTUNATE BRIDEGROOM MOVES
FRESH SCANDALS HAVE
ECLIPSED IT AND THEIR MORE PIQUANT DETAILS HAVE DRAWN THE
GOSSIPS AWAY FROM THIS FOUR YEAR OLD DRAMA
AS I HAVE REASON TO
BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THE FULL FACTS HAVE NEVER BEEN REVEALED TO
THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND AS MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD A
CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN CLEARING THE MATTER UP I FEEL THAT NO
MEMOIR OF HIM WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT SOME LITTLE SKETCH OF
THIS REMARKABLE EPISODE
IT WAS A FEW WEEKS BEFORE MY OWN MARRIAGE DURING THE DAYS WHEN I
WAS STILL SHARING ROOMS WITH HOLMES IN BAKER STREET THAT HE CAME
HOME FROM AN AFTERNOON STROLL TO FIND A LETTER ON THE TABLE
WAITING FOR HIM
I HAD REMAINED INDOORS ALL DAY FOR THE WEATHER
HAD TAKEN A SUDDEN TURN TO RAIN WITH HIGH AUTUMNAL WINDS AND
THE JEZAIL BULLET WHICH I HAD BROUGHT BACK IN ONE OF MY LIMBS AS
A RELIC OF MY AFGHAN CAMPAIGN THROBBED WITH DULL PERSISTENCE
WITH MY BODY IN ONE EASY CHAIR AND MY LEGS UPON ANOTHER I HAD
SURROUNDED MYSELF WITH A CLOUD OF NEWSPAPERS UNTIL AT LAST
SATURATED WITH THE NEWS OF THE DAY I TOSSED THEM ALL ASIDE AND
LAY LISTLESS WATCHING THE HUGE CREST AND MONOGRAM UPON THE
ENVELOPE UPON THE TABLE AND WONDERING LAZILY WHO MY FRIEND'S
NOBLE CORRESPONDENT COULD BE
HERE IS A VERY FASHIONABLE EPISTLE I REMARKED AS HE ENTERED
YOUR MORNING LETTERS IF I REMEMBER RIGHT WERE FROM A
FISH MONGER AND A TIDE WAITER
YES MY CORRESPONDENCE HAS CERTAINLY THE CHARM OF VARIETY HE
ANSWERED SMILING AND THE HUMBLER ARE USUALLY THE MORE
INTERESTING
THIS LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE UNWELCOME SOCIAL
SUMMONSES WHICH CALL UPON A MAN EITHER TO BE BORED OR TO LIE
HE BROKE THE SEAL AND GLANCED OVER THE CONTENTS
OH COME IT MAY PROVE TO BE SOMETHING OF INTEREST AFTER ALL
NOT SOCIAL THEN
NO DISTINCTLY PROFESSIONAL
AND FROM A NOBLE CLIENT
ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN ENGLAND
MY DEAR FELLOW I CONGRATULATE YOU
I ASSURE YOU WATSON WITHOUT AFFECTATION THAT THE STATUS OF MY
CLIENT IS A MATTER OF LESS MOMENT TO ME THAN THE INTEREST OF HIS
CASE
IT IS JUST POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT THAT ALSO MAY NOT BE
WANTING IN THIS NEW INVESTIGATION
YOU HAVE BEEN READING THE
PAPERS DILIGENTLY OF LATE HAVE YOU NOT
IT LOOKS LIKE IT SAID I RUEFULLY POINTING TO A HUGE BUNDLE IN
THE CORNER
I HAVE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO
IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU WILL PERHAPS BE ABLE TO POST ME UP
I
READ NOTHING EXCEPT THE CRIMINAL NEWS AND THE AGONY COLUMN
THE
LATTER IS ALWAYS INSTRUCTIVE
BUT IF YOU HAVE FOLLOWED RECENT
EVENTS SO CLOSELY YOU MUST HAVE READ ABOUT LORD ST
SIMON AND HIS
WEDDING
OH YES WITH THE DEEPEST INTEREST
THAT IS WELL
THE LETTER WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND IS FROM LORD
ST
SIMON
I WILL READ IT TO YOU AND IN RETURN YOU MUST TURN
OVER THESE PAPERS AND LET ME HAVE WHATEVER BEARS UPON THE MATTER
THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS
'MY DEAR MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES LORD BACKWATER TELLS ME THAT I
MAY PLACE IMPLICIT RELIANCE UPON YOUR JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION
I
HAVE DETERMINED THEREFORE TO CALL UPON YOU AND TO CONSULT YOU
IN REFERENCE TO THE VERY PAINFUL EVENT WHICH HAS OCCURRED IN
CONNECTION WITH MY WEDDING
MR
LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD IS
ACTING ALREADY IN THE MATTER BUT HE ASSURES ME THAT HE SEES NO
OBJECTION TO YOUR CO OPERATION AND THAT HE EVEN THINKS THAT
IT MIGHT BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE
I WILL CALL AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN
THE AFTERNOON AND SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ENGAGEMENT AT THAT
TIME I HOPE THAT YOU WILL POSTPONE IT AS THIS MATTER IS OF
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE
YOURS FAITHFULLY ST
SIMON
IT IS DATED FROM GROSVENOR MANSIONS WRITTEN WITH A QUILL PEN
AND THE NOBLE LORD HAS HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO GET A SMEAR OF INK
UPON THE OUTER SIDE OF HIS RIGHT LITTLE FINGER REMARKED HOLMES
AS HE FOLDED UP THE EPISTLE
HE SAYS FOUR O'CLOCK
IT IS THREE NOW
HE WILL BE HERE IN AN
HOUR
THEN I HAVE JUST TIME WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE TO GET CLEAR UPON
THE SUBJECT
TURN OVER THOSE PAPERS AND ARRANGE THE EXTRACTS IN
THEIR ORDER OF TIME WHILE I TAKE A GLANCE AS TO WHO OUR CLIENT
IS HE PICKED A RED COVERED VOLUME FROM A LINE OF BOOKS OF
REFERENCE BESIDE THE MANTELPIECE
HERE HE IS SAID HE SITTING
DOWN AND FLATTENING IT OUT UPON HIS KNEE
'LORD ROBERT WALSINGHAM
DE VERE ST
SIMON SECOND SON OF THE DUKE OF BALMORAL HUM 'ARMS
AZURE THREE CALTROPS IN CHIEF OVER A FESS SABLE
BORN IN 1846
HE'S FORTY ONE YEARS OF AGE WHICH IS MATURE FOR MARRIAGE
WAS
UNDER SECRETARY FOR THE COLONIES IN A LATE ADMINISTRATION
THE
DUKE HIS FATHER WAS AT ONE TIME SECRETARY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS
THEY INHERIT PLANTAGENET BLOOD BY DIRECT DESCENT AND TUDOR ON
THE DISTAFF SIDE
HA WELL THERE IS NOTHING VERY INSTRUCTIVE IN
ALL THIS
I THINK THAT I MUST TURN TO YOU WATSON FOR SOMETHING
MORE SOLID
I HAVE VERY LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING WHAT I WANT SAID I
FOR THE FACTS ARE QUITE RECENT AND THE MATTER STRUCK ME AS
REMARKABLE
I FEARED TO REFER THEM TO YOU HOWEVER AS I KNEW
THAT YOU HAD AN INQUIRY ON HAND AND THAT YOU DISLIKED THE
INTRUSION OF OTHER MATTERS
OH YOU MEAN THE LITTLE PROBLEM OF THE GROSVENOR SQUARE
FURNITURE VAN
THAT IS QUITE CLEARED UP NOW THOUGH INDEED IT
WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE FIRST
PRAY GIVE ME THE RESULTS OF YOUR
NEWSPAPER SELECTIONS
HERE IS THE FIRST NOTICE WHICH I CAN FIND
IT IS IN THE PERSONAL
COLUMN OF THE MORNING POST AND DATES AS YOU SEE SOME WEEKS
BACK 'A MARRIAGE HAS BEEN ARRANGED IT SAYS 'AND WILL IF
RUMOUR IS CORRECT VERY SHORTLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN LORD ROBERT
ST
SIMON SECOND SON OF THE DUKE OF BALMORAL AND MISS HATTY
DORAN THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF ALOYSIUS DORAN
ESQ OF SAN
FRANCISCO CAL U S A THAT IS ALL
TERSE AND TO THE POINT REMARKED HOLMES STRETCHING HIS LONG
THIN LEGS TOWARDS THE FIRE
THERE WAS A PARAGRAPH AMPLIFYING THIS IN ONE OF THE SOCIETY
PAPERS OF THE SAME WEEK
AH HERE IT IS 'THERE WILL SOON BE A
CALL FOR PROTECTION IN THE MARRIAGE MARKET FOR THE PRESENT
FREE TRADE PRINCIPLE APPEARS TO TELL HEAVILY AGAINST OUR HOME
PRODUCT
ONE BY ONE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE HOUSES OF GREAT
BRITAIN IS PASSING INTO THE HANDS OF OUR FAIR COUSINS FROM ACROSS
THE ATLANTIC
AN IMPORTANT ADDITION HAS BEEN MADE DURING THE LAST
WEEK TO THE LIST OF THE PRIZES WHICH HAVE BEEN BORNE AWAY BY
THESE CHARMING INVADERS
LORD ST
SIMON WHO HAS SHOWN HIMSELF
FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS PROOF AGAINST THE LITTLE GOD'S ARROWS HAS
NOW DEFINITELY ANNOUNCED HIS APPROACHING MARRIAGE WITH MISS HATTY
DORAN THE FASCINATING DAUGHTER OF A CALIFORNIA MILLIONAIRE
MISS
DORAN WHOSE GRACEFUL FIGURE AND STRIKING FACE ATTRACTED MUCH
ATTENTION AT THE WESTBURY HOUSE FESTIVITIES IS AN ONLY CHILD
AND IT IS CURRENTLY REPORTED THAT HER DOWRY WILL RUN TO
CONSIDERABLY OVER THE SIX FIGURES WITH EXPECTANCIES FOR THE
FUTURE
AS IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT THE DUKE OF BALMORAL HAS
BEEN COMPELLED TO SELL HIS PICTURES WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS
AND AS LORD ST
SIMON HAS NO PROPERTY OF HIS OWN SAVE THE SMALL
ESTATE OF BIRCHMOOR IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE CALIFORNIAN HEIRESS
IS NOT THE ONLY GAINER BY AN ALLIANCE WHICH WILL ENABLE HER TO
MAKE THE EASY AND COMMON TRANSITION FROM A REPUBLICAN LADY TO A
BRITISH PEERESS
ANYTHING ELSE ASKED HOLMES YAWNING
OH YES PLENTY
THEN THERE IS ANOTHER NOTE IN THE MORNING POST
TO SAY THAT THE MARRIAGE WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTELY QUIET ONE THAT IT
WOULD BE AT ST
GEORGE'S HANOVER SQUARE THAT ONLY HALF A DOZEN
INTIMATE FRIENDS WOULD BE INVITED AND THAT THE PARTY WOULD
RETURN TO THE FURNISHED HOUSE AT LANCASTER GATE WHICH HAS BEEN
TAKEN BY MR
ALOYSIUS DORAN
TWO DAYS LATER THAT IS ON
WEDNESDAY LAST THERE IS A CURT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE WEDDING HAD
TAKEN PLACE AND THAT THE HONEYMOON WOULD BE PASSED AT LORD
BACKWATER'S PLACE NEAR PETERSFIELD
THOSE ARE ALL THE NOTICES
WHICH APPEARED BEFORE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BRIDE
BEFORE THE WHAT ASKED HOLMES WITH A START
THE VANISHING OF THE LADY
WHEN DID SHE VANISH THEN
AT THE WEDDING BREAKFAST
INDEED
THIS IS MORE INTERESTING THAN IT PROMISED TO BE QUITE
DRAMATIC IN FACT
YES IT STRUCK ME AS BEING A LITTLE OUT OF THE COMMON
THEY OFTEN VANISH BEFORE THE CEREMONY AND OCCASIONALLY DURING
THE HONEYMOON BUT I CANNOT CALL TO MIND ANYTHING QUITE SO PROMPT
AS THIS
PRAY LET ME HAVE THE DETAILS
I WARN YOU THAT THEY ARE VERY INCOMPLETE
PERHAPS WE MAY MAKE THEM LESS SO
SUCH AS THEY ARE THEY ARE SET FORTH IN A SINGLE ARTICLE OF A
MORNING PAPER OF YESTERDAY WHICH I WILL READ TO YOU
IT IS
HEADED 'SINGULAR OCCURRENCE AT A FASHIONABLE WEDDING'
'THE FAMILY OF LORD ROBERT ST
SIMON HAS BEEN THROWN INTO THE
GREATEST CONSTERNATION BY THE STRANGE AND PAINFUL EPISODES WHICH
HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH HIS WEDDING
THE CEREMONY AS
SHORTLY ANNOUNCED IN THE PAPERS OF YESTERDAY OCCURRED ON THE
PREVIOUS MORNING BUT IT IS ONLY NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN POSSIBLE TO
CONFIRM THE STRANGE RUMOURS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO PERSISTENTLY
FLOATING ABOUT
IN SPITE OF THE ATTEMPTS OF THE FRIENDS TO HUSH
THE MATTER UP SO MUCH PUBLIC ATTENTION HAS NOW BEEN DRAWN TO IT
THAT NO GOOD PURPOSE CAN BE SERVED BY AFFECTING TO DISREGARD WHAT
IS A COMMON SUBJECT FOR CONVERSATION
'THE CEREMONY WHICH WAS PERFORMED AT ST
GEORGE'S HANOVER
SQUARE WAS A VERY QUIET ONE NO ONE BEING PRESENT SAVE THE
FATHER OF THE BRIDE MR
ALOYSIUS DORAN THE DUCHESS OF BALMORAL
LORD BACKWATER LORD EUSTACE AND LADY CLARA ST
SIMON THE
YOUNGER BROTHER AND SISTER OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND LADY ALICIA
WHITTINGTON
THE WHOLE PARTY PROCEEDED AFTERWARDS TO THE HOUSE OF
MR
ALOYSIUS DORAN AT LANCASTER GATE WHERE BREAKFAST HAD BEEN
PREPARED
IT APPEARS THAT SOME LITTLE TROUBLE WAS CAUSED BY A
WOMAN WHOSE NAME HAS NOT BEEN ASCERTAINED WHO ENDEAVOURED TO
FORCE HER WAY INTO THE HOUSE AFTER THE BRIDAL PARTY ALLEGING
THAT SHE HAD SOME CLAIM UPON LORD ST
SIMON
IT WAS ONLY AFTER A
PAINFUL AND PROLONGED SCENE THAT SHE WAS EJECTED BY THE BUTLER
AND THE FOOTMAN
THE BRIDE WHO HAD FORTUNATELY ENTERED THE HOUSE
BEFORE THIS UNPLEASANT INTERRUPTION HAD SAT DOWN TO BREAKFAST
WITH THE REST WHEN SHE COMPLAINED OF A SUDDEN INDISPOSITION AND
RETIRED TO HER ROOM
HER PROLONGED ABSENCE HAVING CAUSED SOME
COMMENT HER FATHER FOLLOWED HER BUT LEARNED FROM HER MAID THAT
SHE HAD ONLY COME UP TO HER CHAMBER FOR AN INSTANT CAUGHT UP AN
ULSTER AND BONNET AND HURRIED DOWN TO THE PASSAGE
ONE OF THE
FOOTMEN DECLARED THAT HE HAD SEEN A LADY LEAVE THE HOUSE THUS
APPARELLED BUT HAD REFUSED TO CREDIT THAT IT WAS HIS MISTRESS
BELIEVING HER TO BE WITH THE COMPANY
ON ASCERTAINING THAT HIS
DAUGHTER HAD DISAPPEARED MR
ALOYSIUS DORAN IN CONJUNCTION WITH
THE BRIDEGROOM INSTANTLY PUT THEMSELVES IN COMMUNICATION WITH
THE POLICE AND VERY ENERGETIC INQUIRIES ARE BEING MADE WHICH
WILL PROBABLY RESULT IN A SPEEDY CLEARING UP OF THIS VERY
SINGULAR BUSINESS
UP TO A LATE HOUR LAST NIGHT HOWEVER NOTHING
HAD TRANSPIRED AS TO THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE MISSING LADY
THERE
ARE RUMOURS OF FOUL PLAY IN THE MATTER AND IT IS SAID THAT THE
POLICE HAVE CAUSED THE ARREST OF THE WOMAN WHO HAD CAUSED THE
ORIGINAL DISTURBANCE IN THE BELIEF THAT FROM JEALOUSY OR SOME
OTHER MOTIVE SHE MAY HAVE BEEN CONCERNED IN THE STRANGE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BRIDE
AND IS THAT ALL
ONLY ONE LITTLE ITEM IN ANOTHER OF THE MORNING PAPERS BUT IT IS
A SUGGESTIVE ONE
AND IT IS
THAT MISS FLORA MILLAR THE LADY WHO HAD CAUSED THE DISTURBANCE
HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ARRESTED
IT APPEARS THAT SHE WAS FORMERLY A
DANSEUSE AT THE ALLEGRO AND THAT SHE HAS KNOWN THE BRIDEGROOM
FOR SOME YEARS
THERE ARE NO FURTHER PARTICULARS AND THE WHOLE
CASE IS IN YOUR HANDS NOW SO FAR AS IT HAS BEEN SET FORTH IN THE
PUBLIC PRESS
AND AN EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTING CASE IT APPEARS TO BE
I WOULD
NOT HAVE MISSED IT FOR WORLDS
BUT THERE IS A RING AT THE BELL
WATSON AND AS THE CLOCK MAKES IT A FEW MINUTES AFTER FOUR I
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS WILL PROVE TO BE OUR NOBLE CLIENT
DO NOT
DREAM OF GOING WATSON FOR I VERY MUCH PREFER HAVING A WITNESS
IF ONLY AS A CHECK TO MY OWN MEMORY
LORD ROBERT ST
SIMON ANNOUNCED OUR PAGE BOY THROWING OPEN
THE DOOR
A GENTLEMAN ENTERED WITH A PLEASANT CULTURED FACE
HIGH NOSED AND PALE WITH SOMETHING PERHAPS OF PETULANCE ABOUT
THE MOUTH AND WITH THE STEADY WELL OPENED EYE OF A MAN WHOSE
PLEASANT LOT IT HAD EVER BEEN TO COMMAND AND TO BE OBEYED
HIS
MANNER WAS BRISK AND YET HIS GENERAL APPEARANCE GAVE AN UNDUE
IMPRESSION OF AGE FOR HE HAD A SLIGHT FORWARD STOOP AND A LITTLE
BEND OF THE KNEES AS HE WALKED
HIS HAIR TOO AS HE SWEPT OFF
HIS VERY CURLY BRIMMED HAT WAS GRIZZLED ROUND THE EDGES AND THIN
UPON THE TOP
AS TO HIS DRESS IT WAS CAREFUL TO THE VERGE OF
FOPPISHNESS WITH HIGH COLLAR BLACK FROCK COAT WHITE WAISTCOAT
YELLOW GLOVES PATENT LEATHER SHOES AND LIGHT COLOURED GAITERS
HE ADVANCED SLOWLY INTO THE ROOM TURNING HIS HEAD FROM LEFT TO
RIGHT AND SWINGING IN HIS RIGHT HAND THE CORD WHICH HELD HIS
GOLDEN EYEGLASSES
GOOD DAY LORD ST
SIMON SAID HOLMES RISING AND BOWING
PRAY
TAKE THE BASKET CHAIR
THIS IS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE DR
WATSON
DRAW UP A LITTLE TO THE FIRE AND WE WILL TALK THIS
MATTER OVER
A MOST PAINFUL MATTER TO ME AS YOU CAN MOST READILY IMAGINE
MR
HOLMES
I HAVE BEEN CUT TO THE QUICK
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
HAVE ALREADY MANAGED SEVERAL DELICATE CASES OF THIS SORT SIR
THOUGH I PRESUME THAT THEY WERE HARDLY FROM THE SAME CLASS OF
SOCIETY
NO I AM DESCENDING
I BEG PARDON
MY LAST CLIENT OF THE SORT WAS A KING
OH REALLY I HAD NO IDEA
AND WHICH KING
THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA
WHAT HAD HE LOST HIS WIFE
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND SAID HOLMES SUAVELY THAT I EXTEND TO THE
AFFAIRS OF MY OTHER CLIENTS THE SAME SECRECY WHICH I PROMISE TO
YOU IN YOURS
OF COURSE VERY RIGHT VERY RIGHT I'M SURE I BEG PARDON
AS TO
MY OWN CASE I AM READY TO GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION WHICH MAY
ASSIST YOU IN FORMING AN OPINION
THANK YOU
I HAVE ALREADY LEARNED ALL THAT IS IN THE PUBLIC
PRINTS NOTHING MORE
I PRESUME THAT I MAY TAKE IT AS CORRECT THIS
ARTICLE FOR EXAMPLE AS TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BRIDE
LORD ST
SIMON GLANCED OVER IT
YES IT IS CORRECT AS FAR AS IT
GOES
BUT IT NEEDS A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPLEMENTING BEFORE ANYONE COULD
OFFER AN OPINION
I THINK THAT I MAY ARRIVE AT MY FACTS MOST
DIRECTLY BY QUESTIONING YOU
PRAY DO SO
WHEN DID YOU FIRST MEET MISS HATTY DORAN
IN SAN FRANCISCO A YEAR AGO
YOU WERE TRAVELLING IN THE STATES
YES
DID YOU BECOME ENGAGED THEN
NO
BUT YOU WERE ON A FRIENDLY FOOTING
I WAS AMUSED BY HER SOCIETY AND SHE COULD SEE THAT I WAS
AMUSED
HER FATHER IS VERY RICH
HE IS SAID TO BE THE RICHEST MAN ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE
AND HOW DID HE MAKE HIS MONEY
IN MINING
HE HAD NOTHING A FEW YEARS AGO
THEN HE STRUCK GOLD
INVESTED IT AND CAME UP BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS
NOW WHAT IS YOUR OWN IMPRESSION AS TO THE YOUNG LADY'S YOUR
WIFE'S CHARACTER
THE NOBLEMAN SWUNG HIS GLASSES A LITTLE FASTER AND STARED DOWN
INTO THE FIRE
YOU SEE MR
HOLMES SAID HE MY WIFE WAS
TWENTY BEFORE HER FATHER BECAME A RICH MAN
DURING THAT TIME SHE
RAN FREE IN A MINING CAMP AND WANDERED THROUGH WOODS OR
MOUNTAINS SO THAT HER EDUCATION HAS COME FROM NATURE RATHER THAN
FROM THE SCHOOLMASTER
SHE IS WHAT WE CALL IN ENGLAND A TOMBOY
WITH A STRONG NATURE WILD AND FREE UNFETTERED BY ANY SORT OF
TRADITIONS
SHE IS IMPETUOUS VOLCANIC I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
SHE
IS SWIFT IN MAKING UP HER MIND AND FEARLESS IN CARRYING OUT HER
RESOLUTIONS
ON THE OTHER HAND I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN HER THE
NAME WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BEAR HE GAVE A LITTLE STATELY
COUGH HAD NOT I THOUGHT HER TO BE AT BOTTOM A NOBLE WOMAN
I
BELIEVE THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF HEROIC SELF SACRIFICE AND THAT
ANYTHING DISHONOURABLE WOULD BE REPUGNANT TO HER
HAVE YOU HER PHOTOGRAPH
I BROUGHT THIS WITH ME HE OPENED A LOCKET AND SHOWED US THE
FULL FACE OF A VERY LOVELY WOMAN
IT WAS NOT A PHOTOGRAPH BUT AN
IVORY MINIATURE AND THE ARTIST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE FULL EFFECT
OF THE LUSTROUS BLACK HAIR THE LARGE DARK EYES AND THE
EXQUISITE MOUTH
HOLMES GAZED LONG AND EARNESTLY AT IT
THEN HE
CLOSED THE LOCKET AND HANDED IT BACK TO LORD ST
SIMON
THE YOUNG LADY CAME TO LONDON THEN AND YOU RENEWED YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE
YES HER FATHER BROUGHT HER OVER FOR THIS LAST LONDON SEASON
I
MET HER SEVERAL TIMES BECAME ENGAGED TO HER AND HAVE NOW
MARRIED HER
SHE BROUGHT I UNDERSTAND A CONSIDERABLE DOWRY
A FAIR DOWRY
NOT MORE THAN IS USUAL IN MY FAMILY
AND THIS OF COURSE REMAINS TO YOU SINCE THE MARRIAGE IS A
FAIT ACCOMPLI
I REALLY HAVE MADE NO INQUIRIES ON THE SUBJECT
VERY NATURALLY NOT
DID YOU SEE MISS DORAN ON THE DAY BEFORE THE
WEDDING
YES
WAS SHE IN GOOD SPIRITS
NEVER BETTER
SHE KEPT TALKING OF WHAT WE SHOULD DO IN OUR
FUTURE LIVES
INDEED THAT IS VERY INTERESTING
AND ON THE MORNING OF THE
WEDDING
SHE WAS AS BRIGHT AS POSSIBLE AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER THE
CEREMONY
AND DID YOU OBSERVE ANY CHANGE IN HER THEN
WELL TO TELL THE TRUTH I SAW THEN THE FIRST SIGNS THAT I HAD
EVER SEEN THAT HER TEMPER WAS JUST A LITTLE SHARP
THE INCIDENT
HOWEVER WAS TOO TRIVIAL TO RELATE AND CAN HAVE NO POSSIBLE
BEARING UPON THE CASE
PRAY LET US HAVE IT FOR ALL THAT
OH IT IS CHILDISH
SHE DROPPED HER BOUQUET AS WE WENT TOWARDS
THE VESTRY
SHE WAS PASSING THE FRONT PEW AT THE TIME AND IT
FELL OVER INTO THE PEW
THERE WAS A MOMENT'S DELAY BUT THE
GENTLEMAN IN THE PEW HANDED IT UP TO HER AGAIN AND IT DID NOT
APPEAR TO BE THE WORSE FOR THE FALL
YET WHEN I SPOKE TO HER OF
THE MATTER SHE ANSWERED ME ABRUPTLY AND IN THE CARRIAGE ON OUR
WAY HOME SHE SEEMED ABSURDLY AGITATED OVER THIS TRIFLING CAUSE
INDEED YOU SAY THAT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN IN THE PEW
SOME OF
THE GENERAL PUBLIC WERE PRESENT THEN
OH YES
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXCLUDE THEM WHEN THE CHURCH IS
OPEN
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS NOT ONE OF YOUR WIFE'S FRIENDS
NO NO I CALL HIM A GENTLEMAN BY COURTESY BUT HE WAS QUITE A
COMMON LOOKING PERSON
I HARDLY NOTICED HIS APPEARANCE
BUT
REALLY I THINK THAT WE ARE WANDERING RATHER FAR FROM THE POINT
LADY ST
SIMON THEN RETURNED FROM THE WEDDING IN A LESS
CHEERFUL FRAME OF MIND THAN SHE HAD GONE TO IT
WHAT DID SHE DO
ON RE ENTERING HER FATHER'S HOUSE
I SAW HER IN CONVERSATION WITH HER MAID
AND WHO IS HER MAID
ALICE IS HER NAME
SHE IS AN AMERICAN AND CAME FROM CALIFORNIA
WITH HER
A CONFIDENTIAL SERVANT
A LITTLE TOO MUCH SO
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HER MISTRESS ALLOWED
HER TO TAKE GREAT LIBERTIES
STILL OF COURSE IN AMERICA THEY
LOOK UPON THESE THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY
HOW LONG DID SHE SPEAK TO THIS ALICE
OH A FEW MINUTES
I HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF
YOU DID NOT OVERHEAR WHAT THEY SAID
LADY ST
SIMON SAID SOMETHING ABOUT 'JUMPING A CLAIM SHE WAS
ACCUSTOMED TO USE SLANG OF THE KIND
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE
MEANT
AMERICAN SLANG IS VERY EXPRESSIVE SOMETIMES
AND WHAT DID YOUR
WIFE DO WHEN SHE FINISHED SPEAKING TO HER MAID
SHE WALKED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
ON YOUR ARM
NO ALONE
SHE WAS VERY INDEPENDENT IN LITTLE MATTERS LIKE THAT
THEN AFTER WE HAD SAT DOWN FOR TEN MINUTES OR SO SHE ROSE
HURRIEDLY MUTTERED SOME WORDS OF APOLOGY AND LEFT THE ROOM
SHE
NEVER CAME BACK
BUT THIS MAID ALICE AS I UNDERSTAND DEPOSES THAT SHE WENT TO
HER ROOM COVERED HER BRIDE'S DRESS WITH A LONG ULSTER PUT ON A
BONNET AND WENT OUT
QUITE SO
AND SHE WAS AFTERWARDS SEEN WALKING INTO HYDE PARK IN
COMPANY WITH FLORA MILLAR A WOMAN WHO IS NOW IN CUSTODY AND WHO
HAD ALREADY MADE A DISTURBANCE AT MR
DORAN'S HOUSE THAT
MORNING
AH YES
I SHOULD LIKE A FEW PARTICULARS AS TO THIS YOUNG LADY
AND YOUR RELATIONS TO HER
LORD ST
SIMON SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND RAISED HIS EYEBROWS
WE HAVE BEEN ON A FRIENDLY FOOTING FOR SOME YEARS I MAY SAY ON
A VERY FRIENDLY FOOTING
SHE USED TO BE AT THE ALLEGRO
I HAVE
NOT TREATED HER UNGENEROUSLY AND SHE HAD NO JUST CAUSE OF
COMPLAINT AGAINST ME BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOMEN ARE MR
HOLMES
FLORA WAS A DEAR LITTLE THING BUT EXCEEDINGLY HOT HEADED AND
DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO ME
SHE WROTE ME DREADFUL LETTERS WHEN SHE
HEARD THAT I WAS ABOUT TO BE MARRIED AND TO TELL THE TRUTH THE
REASON WHY I HAD THE MARRIAGE CELEBRATED SO QUIETLY WAS THAT I
FEARED LEST THERE MIGHT BE A SCANDAL IN THE CHURCH
SHE CAME TO
MR
DORAN'S DOOR JUST AFTER WE RETURNED AND SHE ENDEAVOURED TO
PUSH HER WAY IN UTTERING VERY ABUSIVE EXPRESSIONS TOWARDS MY
WIFE AND EVEN THREATENING HER BUT I HAD FORESEEN THE
POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING OF THE SORT AND I HAD TWO POLICE
FELLOWS THERE IN PRIVATE CLOTHES WHO SOON PUSHED HER OUT AGAIN
SHE WAS QUIET WHEN SHE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD IN MAKING A
ROW
DID YOUR WIFE HEAR ALL THIS
NO THANK GOODNESS SHE DID NOT
AND SHE WAS SEEN WALKING WITH THIS VERY WOMAN AFTERWARDS
YES
THAT IS WHAT MR
LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD LOOKS UPON AS
SO SERIOUS
IT IS THOUGHT THAT FLORA DECOYED MY WIFE OUT AND LAID
SOME TERRIBLE TRAP FOR HER
WELL IT IS A POSSIBLE SUPPOSITION
YOU THINK SO TOO
I DID NOT SAY A PROBABLE ONE
BUT YOU DO NOT YOURSELF LOOK UPON
THIS AS LIKELY
I DO NOT THINK FLORA WOULD HURT A FLY
STILL JEALOUSY IS A STRANGE TRANSFORMER OF CHARACTERS
PRAY
WHAT IS YOUR OWN THEORY AS TO WHAT TOOK PLACE
WELL REALLY I CAME TO SEEK A THEORY NOT TO PROPOUND ONE
I
HAVE GIVEN YOU ALL THE FACTS
SINCE YOU ASK ME HOWEVER I MAY
SAY THAT IT HAS OCCURRED TO ME AS POSSIBLE THAT THE EXCITEMENT OF
THIS AFFAIR THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD MADE SO IMMENSE A
SOCIAL STRIDE HAD THE EFFECT OF CAUSING SOME LITTLE NERVOUS
DISTURBANCE IN MY WIFE
IN SHORT THAT SHE HAD BECOME SUDDENLY DERANGED
WELL REALLY WHEN I CONSIDER THAT SHE HAS TURNED HER BACK I
WILL NOT SAY UPON ME BUT UPON SO MUCH THAT MANY HAVE ASPIRED TO
WITHOUT SUCCESS I CAN HARDLY EXPLAIN IT IN ANY OTHER FASHION
WELL CERTAINLY THAT IS ALSO A CONCEIVABLE HYPOTHESIS SAID
HOLMES SMILING
AND NOW LORD ST
SIMON I THINK THAT I HAVE
NEARLY ALL MY DATA
MAY I ASK WHETHER YOU WERE SEATED AT THE
BREAKFAST TABLE SO THAT YOU COULD SEE OUT OF THE WINDOW
WE COULD SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE PARK
QUITE SO
THEN I DO NOT THINK THAT I NEED TO DETAIN YOU LONGER
I SHALL COMMUNICATE WITH YOU
SHOULD YOU BE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SAID OUR
CLIENT RISING
I HAVE SOLVED IT
EH WHAT WAS THAT
I SAY THAT I HAVE SOLVED IT
WHERE THEN IS MY WIFE
THAT IS A DETAIL WHICH I SHALL SPEEDILY SUPPLY
LORD ST
SIMON SHOOK HIS HEAD
I AM AFRAID THAT IT WILL TAKE
WISER HEADS THAN YOURS OR MINE HE REMARKED AND BOWING IN A
STATELY OLD FASHIONED MANNER HE DEPARTED
IT IS VERY GOOD OF LORD ST
SIMON TO HONOUR MY HEAD BY PUTTING
IT ON A LEVEL WITH HIS OWN SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHING
I
THINK THAT I SHALL HAVE A WHISKY AND SODA AND A CIGAR AFTER ALL
THIS CROSS QUESTIONING
I HAD FORMED MY CONCLUSIONS AS TO THE
CASE BEFORE OUR CLIENT CAME INTO THE ROOM
MY DEAR HOLMES
I HAVE NOTES OF SEVERAL SIMILAR CASES THOUGH NONE AS I
REMARKED BEFORE WHICH WERE QUITE AS PROMPT
MY WHOLE EXAMINATION
SERVED TO TURN MY CONJECTURE INTO A CERTAINTY
CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE IS OCCASIONALLY VERY CONVINCING AS WHEN YOU FIND A
TROUT IN THE MILK TO QUOTE THOREAU'S EXAMPLE
BUT I HAVE HEARD ALL THAT YOU HAVE HEARD
WITHOUT HOWEVER THE KNOWLEDGE OF PRE EXISTING CASES WHICH
SERVES ME SO WELL
THERE WAS A PARALLEL INSTANCE IN ABERDEEN SOME
YEARS BACK AND SOMETHING ON VERY MUCH THE SAME LINES AT MUNICH
THE YEAR AFTER THE FRANCO PRUSSIAN WAR
IT IS ONE OF THESE
CASES BUT HULLO HERE IS LESTRADE GOOD AFTERNOON LESTRADE
YOU WILL FIND AN EXTRA TUMBLER UPON THE SIDEBOARD AND THERE ARE
CIGARS IN THE BOX
THE OFFICIAL DETECTIVE WAS ATTIRED IN A PEA JACKET AND CRAVAT
WHICH GAVE HIM A DECIDEDLY NAUTICAL APPEARANCE AND HE CARRIED A
BLACK CANVAS BAG IN HIS HAND
WITH A SHORT GREETING HE SEATED
HIMSELF AND LIT THE CIGAR WHICH HAD BEEN OFFERED TO HIM
WHAT'S UP THEN ASKED HOLMES WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
YOU
LOOK DISSATISFIED
AND I FEEL DISSATISFIED
IT IS THIS INFERNAL ST
SIMON MARRIAGE
CASE
I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF THE BUSINESS
REALLY YOU SURPRISE ME
WHO EVER HEARD OF SUCH A MIXED AFFAIR EVERY CLUE SEEMS TO SLIP
THROUGH MY FINGERS
I HAVE BEEN AT WORK UPON IT ALL DAY
AND VERY WET IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE YOU SAID HOLMES LAYING HIS
HAND UPON THE ARM OF THE PEA JACKET
YES I HAVE BEEN DRAGGING THE SERPENTINE
IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHAT FOR
IN SEARCH OF THE BODY OF LADY ST
SIMON
SHERLOCK HOLMES LEANED BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LAUGHED HEARTILY
HAVE YOU DRAGGED THE BASIN OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE FOUNTAIN HE
ASKED
WHY WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BECAUSE YOU HAVE JUST AS GOOD A CHANCE OF FINDING THIS LADY IN
THE ONE AS IN THE OTHER
LESTRADE SHOT AN ANGRY GLANCE AT MY COMPANION
I SUPPOSE YOU
KNOW ALL ABOUT IT HE SNARLED
WELL I HAVE ONLY JUST HEARD THE FACTS BUT MY MIND IS MADE UP
OH INDEED THEN YOU THINK THAT THE SERPENTINE PLAYS NO PART IN
THE MATTER
I THINK IT VERY UNLIKELY
THEN PERHAPS YOU WILL KINDLY EXPLAIN HOW IT IS THAT WE FOUND
THIS IN IT HE OPENED HIS BAG AS HE SPOKE AND TUMBLED ONTO THE
FLOOR A WEDDING DRESS OF WATERED SILK A PAIR OF WHITE SATIN
SHOES AND A BRIDE'S WREATH AND VEIL ALL DISCOLOURED AND SOAKED
IN WATER
THERE SAID HE PUTTING A NEW WEDDING RING UPON THE
TOP OF THE PILE
THERE IS A LITTLE NUT FOR YOU TO CRACK MASTER
HOLMES
OH INDEED SAID MY FRIEND BLOWING BLUE RINGS INTO THE AIR
YOU DRAGGED THEM FROM THE SERPENTINE
NO
THEY WERE FOUND FLOATING NEAR THE MARGIN BY A PARK KEEPER
THEY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HER CLOTHES AND IT SEEMED TO ME
THAT IF THE CLOTHES WERE THERE THE BODY WOULD NOT BE FAR OFF
BY THE SAME BRILLIANT REASONING EVERY MAN'S BODY IS TO BE FOUND
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HIS WARDROBE
AND PRAY WHAT DID YOU HOPE
TO ARRIVE AT THROUGH THIS
AT SOME EVIDENCE IMPLICATING FLORA MILLAR IN THE DISAPPEARANCE
I AM AFRAID THAT YOU WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT
ARE YOU INDEED NOW CRIED LESTRADE WITH SOME BITTERNESS
I
AM AFRAID HOLMES THAT YOU ARE NOT VERY PRACTICAL WITH YOUR
DEDUCTIONS AND YOUR INFERENCES
YOU HAVE MADE TWO BLUNDERS IN AS
MANY MINUTES
THIS DRESS DOES IMPLICATE MISS FLORA MILLAR
AND HOW
IN THE DRESS IS A POCKET
IN THE POCKET IS A CARD CASE
IN THE
CARD CASE IS A NOTE
AND HERE IS THE VERY NOTE HE SLAPPED IT
DOWN UPON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HIM
LISTEN TO THIS 'YOU WILL
SEE ME WHEN ALL IS READY
COME AT ONCE
F H M NOW MY THEORY ALL
ALONG HAS BEEN THAT LADY ST
SIMON WAS DECOYED AWAY BY FLORA
MILLAR AND THAT SHE WITH CONFEDERATES NO DOUBT WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DISAPPEARANCE
HERE SIGNED WITH HER
INITIALS IS THE VERY NOTE WHICH WAS NO DOUBT QUIETLY SLIPPED
INTO HER HAND AT THE DOOR AND WHICH LURED HER WITHIN THEIR
REACH
VERY GOOD LESTRADE SAID HOLMES LAUGHING
YOU REALLY ARE
VERY FINE INDEED
LET ME SEE IT HE TOOK UP THE PAPER IN A
LISTLESS WAY BUT HIS ATTENTION INSTANTLY BECAME RIVETED AND HE
GAVE A LITTLE CRY OF SATISFACTION
THIS IS INDEED IMPORTANT
SAID HE
HA YOU FIND IT SO
EXTREMELY SO
I CONGRATULATE YOU WARMLY
LESTRADE ROSE IN HIS TRIUMPH AND BENT HIS HEAD TO LOOK
WHY HE
SHRIEKED YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE WRONG SIDE
ON THE CONTRARY THIS IS THE RIGHT SIDE
THE RIGHT SIDE YOU'RE MAD HERE IS THE NOTE WRITTEN IN PENCIL
OVER HERE
AND OVER HERE IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE FRAGMENT OF A HOTEL
BILL WHICH INTERESTS ME DEEPLY
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT
I LOOKED AT IT BEFORE SAID LESTRADE
'OCT
4TH ROOMS 8S BREAKFAST 2S
6D COCKTAIL 1S LUNCH 2S
6D GLASS SHERRY 8D I SEE NOTHING IN THAT
VERY LIKELY NOT
IT IS MOST IMPORTANT ALL THE SAME
AS TO THE
NOTE IT IS IMPORTANT ALSO OR AT LEAST THE INITIALS ARE SO I
CONGRATULATE YOU AGAIN
I'VE WASTED TIME ENOUGH SAID LESTRADE RISING
I BELIEVE IN
HARD WORK AND NOT IN SITTING BY THE FIRE SPINNING FINE THEORIES
GOOD DAY MR
HOLMES AND WE SHALL SEE WHICH GETS TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE MATTER FIRST HE GATHERED UP THE GARMENTS THRUST THEM
INTO THE BAG AND MADE FOR THE DOOR
JUST ONE HINT TO YOU LESTRADE DRAWLED HOLMES BEFORE HIS RIVAL
VANISHED I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUE SOLUTION OF THE MATTER
LADY
ST
SIMON IS A MYTH
THERE IS NOT AND THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ANY
SUCH PERSON
LESTRADE LOOKED SADLY AT MY COMPANION
THEN HE TURNED TO ME
TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD THREE TIMES SHOOK HIS HEAD SOLEMNLY AND
HURRIED AWAY
HE HAD HARDLY SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WHEN HOLMES ROSE TO PUT ON
HIS OVERCOAT
THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT THE FELLOW SAYS ABOUT
OUTDOOR WORK HE REMARKED SO I THINK WATSON THAT I MUST
LEAVE YOU TO YOUR PAPERS FOR A LITTLE
IT WAS AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN SHERLOCK HOLMES LEFT ME BUT I HAD
NO TIME TO BE LONELY FOR WITHIN AN HOUR THERE ARRIVED A
CONFECTIONER'S MAN WITH A VERY LARGE FLAT BOX
THIS HE UNPACKED
WITH THE HELP OF A YOUTH WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND
PRESENTLY TO MY VERY GREAT ASTONISHMENT A QUITE EPICUREAN
LITTLE COLD SUPPER BEGAN TO BE LAID OUT UPON OUR HUMBLE
LODGING HOUSE MAHOGANY
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF BRACE OF COLD
WOODCOCK A PHEASANT A PT DE FOIE GRAS PIE WITH A GROUP OF
ANCIENT AND COBWEBBY BOTTLES
HAVING LAID OUT ALL THESE LUXURIES
MY TWO VISITORS VANISHED AWAY LIKE THE GENII OF THE ARABIAN
NIGHTS WITH NO EXPLANATION SAVE THAT THE THINGS HAD BEEN PAID
FOR AND WERE ORDERED TO THIS ADDRESS
JUST BEFORE NINE O'CLOCK SHERLOCK HOLMES STEPPED BRISKLY INTO THE
ROOM
HIS FEATURES WERE GRAVELY SET BUT THERE WAS A LIGHT IN HIS
EYE WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN HIS
CONCLUSIONS
THEY HAVE LAID THE SUPPER THEN HE SAID RUBBING HIS HANDS
YOU SEEM TO EXPECT COMPANY
THEY HAVE LAID FOR FIVE
YES I FANCY WE MAY HAVE SOME COMPANY DROPPING IN SAID HE
I
AM SURPRISED THAT LORD ST
SIMON HAS NOT ALREADY ARRIVED
HA I
FANCY THAT I HEAR HIS STEP NOW UPON THE STAIRS
IT WAS INDEED OUR VISITOR OF THE AFTERNOON WHO CAME BUSTLING IN
DANGLING HIS GLASSES MORE VIGOROUSLY THAN EVER AND WITH A VERY
PERTURBED EXPRESSION UPON HIS ARISTOCRATIC FEATURES
MY MESSENGER REACHED YOU THEN ASKED HOLMES
YES AND I CONFESS THAT THE CONTENTS STARTLED ME BEYOND MEASURE
HAVE YOU GOOD AUTHORITY FOR WHAT YOU SAY
THE BEST POSSIBLE
LORD ST
SIMON SANK INTO A CHAIR AND PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS
FOREHEAD
WHAT WILL THE DUKE SAY HE MURMURED WHEN HE HEARS THAT ONE OF
THE FAMILY HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO SUCH HUMILIATION
IT IS THE PUREST ACCIDENT
I CANNOT ALLOW THAT THERE IS ANY
HUMILIATION
AH YOU LOOK ON THESE THINGS FROM ANOTHER STANDPOINT
I FAIL TO SEE THAT ANYONE IS TO BLAME
I CAN HARDLY SEE HOW THE
LADY COULD HAVE ACTED OTHERWISE THOUGH HER ABRUPT METHOD OF
DOING IT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY TO BE REGRETTED
HAVING NO MOTHER SHE
HAD NO ONE TO ADVISE HER AT SUCH A CRISIS
IT WAS A SLIGHT SIR A PUBLIC SLIGHT SAID LORD ST
SIMON
TAPPING HIS FINGERS UPON THE TABLE
YOU MUST MAKE ALLOWANCE FOR THIS POOR GIRL PLACED IN SO
UNPRECEDENTED A POSITION
I WILL MAKE NO ALLOWANCE
I AM VERY ANGRY INDEED AND I HAVE
BEEN SHAMEFULLY USED
I THINK THAT I HEARD A RING SAID HOLMES
YES THERE ARE STEPS
ON THE LANDING
IF I CANNOT PERSUADE YOU TO TAKE A LENIENT VIEW
OF THE MATTER LORD ST
SIMON I HAVE BROUGHT AN ADVOCATE HERE
WHO MAY BE MORE SUCCESSFUL HE OPENED THE DOOR AND USHERED IN A
LADY AND GENTLEMAN
LORD ST
SIMON SAID HE ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO MR
AND MRS
FRANCIS HAY MOULTON
THE LADY I
THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY MET
AT THE SIGHT OF THESE NEWCOMERS OUR CLIENT HAD SPRUNG FROM HIS
SEAT AND STOOD VERY ERECT WITH HIS EYES CAST DOWN AND HIS HAND
THRUST INTO THE BREAST OF HIS FROCK COAT A PICTURE OF OFFENDED
DIGNITY
THE LADY HAD TAKEN A QUICK STEP FORWARD AND HAD HELD OUT
HER HAND TO HIM BUT HE STILL REFUSED TO RAISE HIS EYES
IT WAS
AS WELL FOR HIS RESOLUTION PERHAPS FOR HER PLEADING FACE WAS
ONE WHICH IT WAS HARD TO RESIST
YOU'RE ANGRY ROBERT SAID SHE
WELL I GUESS YOU HAVE EVERY
CAUSE TO BE
PRAY MAKE NO APOLOGY TO ME SAID LORD ST
SIMON BITTERLY
OH YES I KNOW THAT I HAVE TREATED YOU REAL BAD AND THAT I
SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU BEFORE I WENT BUT I WAS KIND OF
RATTLED AND FROM THE TIME WHEN I SAW FRANK HERE AGAIN I JUST
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING OR SAYING
I ONLY WONDER I DIDN'T
FALL DOWN AND DO A FAINT RIGHT THERE BEFORE THE ALTAR
PERHAPS MRS
MOULTON YOU WOULD LIKE MY FRIEND AND ME TO LEAVE
THE ROOM WHILE YOU EXPLAIN THIS MATTER
IF I MAY GIVE AN OPINION REMARKED THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN
WE'VE HAD JUST A LITTLE TOO MUCH SECRECY OVER THIS BUSINESS
ALREADY
FOR MY PART I SHOULD LIKE ALL EUROPE AND AMERICA TO
HEAR THE RIGHTS OF IT HE WAS A SMALL WIRY SUNBURNT MAN
CLEAN SHAVEN WITH A SHARP FACE AND ALERT MANNER
THEN I'LL TELL OUR STORY RIGHT AWAY SAID THE LADY
FRANK HERE
AND I MET IN '84 IN MCQUIRE'S CAMP NEAR THE ROCKIES WHERE PA
WAS WORKING A CLAIM
WE WERE ENGAGED TO EACH OTHER FRANK AND I
BUT THEN ONE DAY FATHER STRUCK A RICH POCKET AND MADE A PILE
WHILE POOR FRANK HERE HAD A CLAIM THAT PETERED OUT AND CAME TO
NOTHING
THE RICHER PA GREW THE POORER WAS FRANK SO AT LAST PA
WOULDN'T HEAR OF OUR ENGAGEMENT LASTING ANY LONGER AND HE TOOK
ME AWAY TO 'FRISCO
FRANK WOULDN'T THROW UP HIS HAND THOUGH SO
HE FOLLOWED ME THERE AND HE SAW ME WITHOUT PA KNOWING ANYTHING
ABOUT IT
IT WOULD ONLY HAVE MADE HIM MAD TO KNOW SO WE JUST
FIXED IT ALL UP FOR OURSELVES
FRANK SAID THAT HE WOULD GO AND
MAKE HIS PILE TOO AND NEVER COME BACK TO CLAIM ME UNTIL HE HAD
AS MUCH AS PA
SO THEN I PROMISED TO WAIT FOR HIM TO THE END OF
TIME AND PLEDGED MYSELF NOT TO MARRY ANYONE ELSE WHILE HE LIVED
'WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE MARRIED RIGHT AWAY THEN SAID HE 'AND
THEN I WILL FEEL SURE OF YOU AND I WON'T CLAIM TO BE YOUR
HUSBAND UNTIL I COME BACK WELL WE TALKED IT OVER AND HE HAD
FIXED IT ALL UP SO NICELY WITH A CLERGYMAN ALL READY IN WAITING
THAT WE JUST DID IT RIGHT THERE AND THEN FRANK WENT OFF TO SEEK
HIS FORTUNE AND I WENT BACK TO PA
THE NEXT I HEARD OF FRANK WAS THAT HE WAS IN MONTANA AND THEN
HE WENT PROSPECTING IN ARIZONA AND THEN I HEARD OF HIM FROM NEW
MEXICO
AFTER THAT CAME A LONG NEWSPAPER STORY ABOUT HOW A
MINERS' CAMP HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY APACHE INDIANS AND THERE WAS
MY FRANK'S NAME AMONG THE KILLED
I FAINTED DEAD AWAY AND I WAS
VERY SICK FOR MONTHS AFTER
PA THOUGHT I HAD A DECLINE AND TOOK
ME TO HALF THE DOCTORS IN 'FRISCO
NOT A WORD OF NEWS CAME FOR A
YEAR AND MORE SO THAT I NEVER DOUBTED THAT FRANK WAS REALLY
DEAD
THEN LORD ST
SIMON CAME TO 'FRISCO AND WE CAME TO LONDON
AND A MARRIAGE WAS ARRANGED AND PA WAS VERY PLEASED BUT I FELT
ALL THE TIME THAT NO MAN ON THIS EARTH WOULD EVER TAKE THE PLACE
IN MY HEART THAT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO MY POOR FRANK
STILL IF I HAD MARRIED LORD ST
SIMON OF COURSE I'D HAVE DONE
MY DUTY BY HIM
WE CAN'T COMMAND OUR LOVE BUT WE CAN OUR
ACTIONS
I WENT TO THE ALTAR WITH HIM WITH THE INTENTION TO MAKE
HIM JUST AS GOOD A WIFE AS IT WAS IN ME TO BE
BUT YOU MAY
IMAGINE WHAT I FELT WHEN JUST AS I CAME TO THE ALTAR RAILS I
GLANCED BACK AND SAW FRANK STANDING AND LOOKING AT ME OUT OF THE
FIRST PEW
I THOUGHT IT WAS HIS GHOST AT FIRST BUT WHEN I LOOKED
AGAIN THERE HE WAS STILL WITH A KIND OF QUESTION IN HIS EYES AS
IF TO ASK ME WHETHER I WERE GLAD OR SORRY TO SEE HIM
I WONDER I
DIDN'T DROP
I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING WAS TURNING ROUND AND THE
WORDS OF THE CLERGYMAN WERE JUST LIKE THE BUZZ OF A BEE IN MY
EAR
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
SHOULD I STOP THE SERVICE AND MAKE
A SCENE IN THE CHURCH I GLANCED AT HIM AGAIN AND HE SEEMED TO
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING FOR HE RAISED HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS TO
TELL ME TO BE STILL
THEN I SAW HIM SCRIBBLE ON A PIECE OF PAPER
AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS WRITING ME A NOTE
AS I PASSED HIS PEW ON
THE WAY OUT I DROPPED MY BOUQUET OVER TO HIM AND HE SLIPPED THE
NOTE INTO MY HAND WHEN HE RETURNED ME THE FLOWERS
IT WAS ONLY A
LINE ASKING ME TO JOIN HIM WHEN HE MADE THE SIGN TO ME TO DO SO
OF COURSE I NEVER DOUBTED FOR A MOMENT THAT MY FIRST DUTY WAS NOW
TO HIM AND I DETERMINED TO DO JUST WHATEVER HE MIGHT DIRECT
WHEN I GOT BACK I TOLD MY MAID WHO HAD KNOWN HIM IN CALIFORNIA
AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN HIS FRIEND
I ORDERED HER TO SAY NOTHING BUT
TO GET A FEW THINGS PACKED AND MY ULSTER READY
I KNOW I OUGHT TO
HAVE SPOKEN TO LORD ST
SIMON BUT IT WAS DREADFUL HARD BEFORE
HIS MOTHER AND ALL THOSE GREAT PEOPLE
I JUST MADE UP MY MIND TO
RUN AWAY AND EXPLAIN AFTERWARDS
I HADN'T BEEN AT THE TABLE TEN
MINUTES BEFORE I SAW FRANK OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE ROAD
HE BECKONED TO ME AND THEN BEGAN WALKING INTO THE PARK
I SLIPPED OUT PUT ON MY THINGS AND FOLLOWED HIM
SOME WOMAN
CAME TALKING SOMETHING OR OTHER ABOUT LORD ST
SIMON TO
ME SEEMED TO ME FROM THE LITTLE I HEARD AS IF HE HAD A LITTLE
SECRET OF HIS OWN BEFORE MARRIAGE ALSO BUT I MANAGED TO GET AWAY
FROM HER AND SOON OVERTOOK FRANK
WE GOT INTO A CAB TOGETHER AND
AWAY WE DROVE TO SOME LODGINGS HE HAD TAKEN IN GORDON SQUARE AND
THAT WAS MY TRUE WEDDING AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS OF WAITING
FRANK
HAD BEEN A PRISONER AMONG THE APACHES HAD ESCAPED CAME ON TO
'FRISCO FOUND THAT I HAD GIVEN HIM UP FOR DEAD AND HAD GONE TO
ENGLAND FOLLOWED ME THERE AND HAD COME UPON ME AT LAST ON THE
VERY MORNING OF MY SECOND WEDDING
I SAW IT IN A PAPER EXPLAINED THE AMERICAN
IT GAVE THE NAME
AND THE CHURCH BUT NOT WHERE THE LADY LIVED
THEN WE HAD A TALK AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND FRANK WAS ALL
FOR OPENNESS BUT I WAS SO ASHAMED OF IT ALL THAT I FELT AS IF I
SHOULD LIKE TO VANISH AWAY AND NEVER SEE ANY OF THEM AGAIN JUST
SENDING A LINE TO PA PERHAPS TO SHOW HIM THAT I WAS ALIVE
IT
WAS AWFUL TO ME TO THINK OF ALL THOSE LORDS AND LADIES SITTING
ROUND THAT BREAKFAST TABLE AND WAITING FOR ME TO COME BACK
SO
FRANK TOOK MY WEDDING CLOTHES AND THINGS AND MADE A BUNDLE OF
THEM SO THAT I SHOULD NOT BE TRACED AND DROPPED THEM AWAY
SOMEWHERE WHERE NO ONE COULD FIND THEM
IT IS LIKELY THAT WE
SHOULD HAVE GONE ON TO PARIS TO MORROW ONLY THAT THIS GOOD
GENTLEMAN MR
HOLMES CAME ROUND TO US THIS EVENING THOUGH HOW
HE FOUND US IS MORE THAN I CAN THINK AND HE SHOWED US VERY
CLEARLY AND KINDLY THAT I WAS WRONG AND THAT FRANK WAS RIGHT AND
THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING OURSELVES IN THE WRONG IF WE WERE SO
SECRET
THEN HE OFFERED TO GIVE US A CHANCE OF TALKING TO LORD
ST
SIMON ALONE AND SO WE CAME RIGHT AWAY ROUND TO HIS ROOMS AT
ONCE
NOW ROBERT YOU HAVE HEARD IT ALL AND I AM VERY SORRY IF
I HAVE GIVEN YOU PAIN AND I HOPE THAT YOU DO NOT THINK VERY
MEANLY OF ME
LORD ST
SIMON HAD BY NO MEANS RELAXED HIS RIGID ATTITUDE BUT
HAD LISTENED WITH A FROWNING BROW AND A COMPRESSED LIP TO THIS
LONG NARRATIVE
EXCUSE ME HE SAID BUT IT IS NOT MY CUSTOM TO DISCUSS MY MOST
INTIMATE PERSONAL AFFAIRS IN THIS PUBLIC MANNER
THEN YOU WON'T FORGIVE ME YOU WON'T SHAKE HANDS BEFORE I GO
OH CERTAINLY IF IT WOULD GIVE YOU ANY PLEASURE HE PUT OUT
HIS HAND AND COLDLY GRASPED THAT WHICH SHE EXTENDED TO HIM
I HAD HOPED SUGGESTED HOLMES THAT YOU WOULD HAVE JOINED US
IN A FRIENDLY SUPPER
I THINK THAT THERE YOU ASK A LITTLE TOO MUCH RESPONDED HIS
LORDSHIP
I MAY BE FORCED TO ACQUIESCE IN THESE RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS BUT I CAN HARDLY BE EXPECTED TO MAKE MERRY OVER
THEM
I THINK THAT WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WILL NOW WISH YOU ALL A
VERY GOOD NIGHT HE INCLUDED US ALL IN A SWEEPING BOW AND
STALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
THEN I TRUST THAT YOU AT LEAST WILL HONOUR ME WITH YOUR
COMPANY SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES
IT IS ALWAYS A JOY TO MEET AN
AMERICAN MR
MOULTON FOR I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE
FOLLY OF A MONARCH AND THE BLUNDERING OF A MINISTER IN FAR GONE
YEARS WILL NOT PREVENT OUR CHILDREN FROM BEING SOME DAY CITIZENS
OF THE SAME WORLD WIDE COUNTRY UNDER A FLAG WHICH SHALL BE A
QUARTERING OF THE UNION JACK WITH THE STARS AND STRIPES
THE CASE HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING ONE REMARKED HOLMES WHEN OUR
VISITORS HAD LEFT US BECAUSE IT SERVES TO SHOW VERY CLEARLY HOW
SIMPLE THE EXPLANATION MAY BE OF AN AFFAIR WHICH AT FIRST SIGHT
SEEMS TO BE ALMOST INEXPLICABLE
NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL
THAN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS AS NARRATED BY THIS LADY AND NOTHING
STRANGER THAN THE RESULT WHEN VIEWED FOR INSTANCE BY MR
LESTRADE OF SCOTLAND YARD
YOU WERE NOT YOURSELF AT FAULT AT ALL THEN
FROM THE FIRST TWO FACTS WERE VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THE ONE THAT
THE LADY HAD BEEN QUITE WILLING TO UNDERGO THE WEDDING CEREMONY
THE OTHER THAT SHE HAD REPENTED OF IT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF
RETURNING HOME
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED DURING THE
MORNING THEN TO CAUSE HER TO CHANGE HER MIND
WHAT COULD THAT
SOMETHING BE SHE COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO ANYONE WHEN SHE WAS
OUT FOR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE COMPANY OF THE BRIDEGROOM
HAD SHE
SEEN SOMEONE THEN IF SHE HAD IT MUST BE SOMEONE FROM AMERICA
BECAUSE SHE HAD SPENT SO SHORT A TIME IN THIS COUNTRY THAT SHE
COULD HARDLY HAVE ALLOWED ANYONE TO ACQUIRE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE
OVER HER THAT THE MERE SIGHT OF HIM WOULD INDUCE HER TO CHANGE
HER PLANS SO COMPLETELY
YOU SEE WE HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED BY A
PROCESS OF EXCLUSION AT THE IDEA THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SEEN AN
AMERICAN
THEN WHO COULD THIS AMERICAN BE AND WHY SHOULD HE
POSSESS SO MUCH INFLUENCE OVER HER IT MIGHT BE A LOVER IT MIGHT
BE A HUSBAND
HER YOUNG WOMANHOOD HAD I KNEW BEEN SPENT IN
ROUGH SCENES AND UNDER STRANGE CONDITIONS
SO FAR I HAD GOT
BEFORE I EVER HEARD LORD ST
SIMON'S NARRATIVE
WHEN HE TOLD US
OF A MAN IN A PEW OF THE CHANGE IN THE BRIDE'S MANNER OF SO
TRANSPARENT A DEVICE FOR OBTAINING A NOTE AS THE DROPPING OF A
BOUQUET OF HER RESORT TO HER CONFIDENTIAL MAID AND OF HER VERY
SIGNIFICANT ALLUSION TO CLAIM JUMPING WHICH IN MINERS' PARLANCE
MEANS TAKING POSSESSION OF THAT WHICH ANOTHER PERSON HAS A PRIOR
CLAIM TO THE WHOLE SITUATION BECAME ABSOLUTELY CLEAR
SHE HAD
GONE OFF WITH A MAN AND THE MAN WAS EITHER A LOVER OR WAS A
PREVIOUS HUSBAND THE CHANCES BEING IN FAVOUR OF THE LATTER
AND HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU FIND THEM
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT BUT FRIEND LESTRADE HELD
INFORMATION IN HIS HANDS THE VALUE OF WHICH HE DID NOT HIMSELF
KNOW
THE INITIALS WERE OF COURSE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE
BUT MORE VALUABLE STILL WAS IT TO KNOW THAT WITHIN A WEEK HE HAD
SETTLED HIS BILL AT ONE OF THE MOST SELECT LONDON HOTELS
HOW DID YOU DEDUCE THE SELECT
BY THE SELECT PRICES
EIGHT SHILLINGS FOR A BED AND EIGHTPENCE
FOR A GLASS OF SHERRY POINTED TO ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
HOTELS
THERE ARE NOT MANY IN LONDON WHICH CHARGE AT THAT RATE
IN THE SECOND ONE WHICH I VISITED IN NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE I
LEARNED BY AN INSPECTION OF THE BOOK THAT FRANCIS H
MOULTON AN
AMERICAN GENTLEMAN HAD LEFT ONLY THE DAY BEFORE AND ON LOOKING
OVER THE ENTRIES AGAINST HIM I CAME UPON THE VERY ITEMS WHICH I
HAD SEEN IN THE DUPLICATE BILL
HIS LETTERS WERE TO BE FORWARDED
TO 226 GORDON SQUARE SO THITHER I TRAVELLED AND BEING FORTUNATE
ENOUGH TO FIND THE LOVING COUPLE AT HOME I VENTURED TO GIVE THEM
SOME PATERNAL ADVICE AND TO POINT OUT TO THEM THAT IT WOULD BE
BETTER IN EVERY WAY THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE THEIR POSITION A LITTLE
CLEARER BOTH TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND TO LORD ST
SIMON IN
PARTICULAR
I INVITED THEM TO MEET HIM HERE AND AS YOU SEE I
MADE HIM KEEP THE APPOINTMENT
BUT WITH NO VERY GOOD RESULT I REMARKED
HIS CONDUCT WAS
CERTAINLY NOT VERY GRACIOUS
AH WATSON SAID HOLMES SMILING PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE
VERY GRACIOUS EITHER IF AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE OF WOOING AND
WEDDING YOU FOUND YOURSELF DEPRIVED IN AN INSTANT OF WIFE AND OF
FORTUNE
I THINK THAT WE MAY JUDGE LORD ST
SIMON VERY MERCIFULLY
AND THANK OUR STARS THAT WE ARE NEVER LIKELY TO FIND OURSELVES IN
THE SAME POSITION
DRAW YOUR CHAIR UP AND HAND ME MY VIOLIN FOR
THE ONLY PROBLEM WE HAVE STILL TO SOLVE IS HOW TO WHILE AWAY
THESE BLEAK AUTUMNAL EVENINGS
XI
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
HOLMES SAID I AS I STOOD ONE MORNING IN OUR BOW WINDOW LOOKING
DOWN THE STREET HERE IS A MADMAN COMING ALONG
IT SEEMS RATHER
SAD THAT HIS RELATIVES SHOULD ALLOW HIM TO COME OUT ALONE
MY FRIEND ROSE LAZILY FROM HIS ARMCHAIR AND STOOD WITH HIS HANDS
IN THE POCKETS OF HIS DRESSING GOWN LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER
IT
WAS A BRIGHT CRISP FEBRUARY MORNING AND THE SNOW OF THE DAY
BEFORE STILL LAY DEEP UPON THE GROUND SHIMMERING BRIGHTLY IN THE
WINTRY SUN
DOWN THE CENTRE OF BAKER STREET IT HAD BEEN PLOUGHED
INTO A BROWN CRUMBLY BAND BY THE TRAFFIC BUT AT EITHER SIDE AND
ON THE HEAPED UP EDGES OF THE FOOT PATHS IT STILL LAY AS WHITE AS
WHEN IT FELL
THE GREY PAVEMENT HAD BEEN CLEANED AND SCRAPED BUT
WAS STILL DANGEROUSLY SLIPPERY SO THAT THERE WERE FEWER
PASSENGERS THAN USUAL
INDEED FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE
METROPOLITAN STATION NO ONE WAS COMING SAVE THE SINGLE GENTLEMAN
WHOSE ECCENTRIC CONDUCT HAD DRAWN MY ATTENTION
HE WAS A MAN OF ABOUT FIFTY TALL PORTLY AND IMPOSING WITH A
MASSIVE STRONGLY MARKED FACE AND A COMMANDING FIGURE
HE WAS
DRESSED IN A SOMBRE YET RICH STYLE IN BLACK FROCK COAT SHINING
HAT NEAT BROWN GAITERS AND WELL CUT PEARL GREY TROUSERS
YET
HIS ACTIONS WERE IN ABSURD CONTRAST TO THE DIGNITY OF HIS DRESS
AND FEATURES FOR HE WAS RUNNING HARD WITH OCCASIONAL LITTLE
SPRINGS SUCH AS A WEARY MAN GIVES WHO IS LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO
SET ANY TAX UPON HIS LEGS
AS HE RAN HE JERKED HIS HANDS UP AND
DOWN WAGGLED HIS HEAD AND WRITHED HIS FACE INTO THE MOST
EXTRAORDINARY CONTORTIONS
WHAT ON EARTH CAN BE THE MATTER WITH HIM I ASKED
HE IS
LOOKING UP AT THE NUMBERS OF THE HOUSES
I BELIEVE THAT HE IS COMING HERE SAID HOLMES RUBBING HIS
HANDS
HERE
YES I RATHER THINK HE IS COMING TO CONSULT ME PROFESSIONALLY
I
THINK THAT I RECOGNISE THE SYMPTOMS
HA DID I NOT TELL YOU AS
HE SPOKE THE MAN PUFFING AND BLOWING RUSHED AT OUR DOOR AND
PULLED AT OUR BELL UNTIL THE WHOLE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH THE
CLANGING
A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE WAS IN OUR ROOM STILL PUFFING STILL
GESTICULATING BUT WITH SO FIXED A LOOK OF GRIEF AND DESPAIR IN
HIS EYES THAT OUR SMILES WERE TURNED IN AN INSTANT TO HORROR AND
PITY
FOR A WHILE HE COULD NOT GET HIS WORDS OUT BUT SWAYED HIS
BODY AND PLUCKED AT HIS HAIR LIKE ONE WHO HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO THE
EXTREME LIMITS OF HIS REASON
THEN SUDDENLY SPRINGING TO HIS
FEET HE BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL WITH SUCH FORCE THAT WE
BOTH RUSHED UPON HIM AND TORE HIM AWAY TO THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM
SHERLOCK HOLMES PUSHED HIM DOWN INTO THE EASY CHAIR AND SITTING
BESIDE HIM PATTED HIS HAND AND CHATTED WITH HIM IN THE EASY
SOOTHING TONES WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO EMPLOY
YOU HAVE COME TO ME TO TELL YOUR STORY HAVE YOU NOT SAID HE
YOU ARE FATIGUED WITH YOUR HASTE
PRAY WAIT UNTIL YOU HAVE
RECOVERED YOURSELF AND THEN I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO LOOK INTO
ANY LITTLE PROBLEM WHICH YOU MAY SUBMIT TO ME
THE MAN SAT FOR A MINUTE OR MORE WITH A HEAVING CHEST FIGHTING
AGAINST HIS EMOTION
THEN HE PASSED HIS HANDKERCHIEF OVER HIS
BROW SET HIS LIPS TIGHT AND TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS US
NO DOUBT YOU THINK ME MAD SAID HE
I SEE THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME GREAT TROUBLE RESPONDED HOLMES
GOD KNOWS I HAVE A TROUBLE WHICH IS ENOUGH TO UNSEAT MY
REASON SO SUDDEN AND SO TERRIBLE IS IT
PUBLIC DISGRACE I MIGHT
HAVE FACED ALTHOUGH I AM A MAN WHOSE CHARACTER HAS NEVER YET
BORNE A STAIN
PRIVATE AFFLICTION ALSO IS THE LOT OF EVERY MAN
BUT THE TWO COMING TOGETHER AND IN SO FRIGHTFUL A FORM HAVE
BEEN ENOUGH TO SHAKE MY VERY SOUL
BESIDES IT IS NOT I ALONE
THE VERY NOBLEST IN THE LAND MAY SUFFER UNLESS SOME WAY BE FOUND
OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR
PRAY COMPOSE YOURSELF SIR SAID HOLMES AND LET ME HAVE A
CLEAR ACCOUNT OF WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT IT IS THAT HAS BEFALLEN
YOU
MY NAME ANSWERED OUR VISITOR IS PROBABLY FAMILIAR TO YOUR
EARS
I AM ALEXANDER HOLDER OF THE BANKING FIRM OF HOLDER
STEVENSON OF THREADNEEDLE STREET
THE NAME WAS INDEED WELL KNOWN TO US AS BELONGING TO THE SENIOR
PARTNER IN THE SECOND LARGEST PRIVATE BANKING CONCERN IN THE CITY
OF LONDON
WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED THEN TO BRING ONE OF THE
FOREMOST CITIZENS OF LONDON TO THIS MOST PITIABLE PASS WE
WAITED ALL CURIOSITY UNTIL WITH ANOTHER EFFORT HE BRACED
HIMSELF TO TELL HIS STORY
I FEEL THAT TIME IS OF VALUE SAID HE THAT IS WHY I HASTENED
HERE WHEN THE POLICE INSPECTOR SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD SECURE
YOUR CO OPERATION
I CAME TO BAKER STREET BY THE UNDERGROUND AND
HURRIED FROM THERE ON FOOT FOR THE CABS GO SLOWLY THROUGH THIS
SNOW
THAT IS WHY I WAS SO OUT OF BREATH FOR I AM A MAN WHO
TAKES VERY LITTLE EXERCISE
I FEEL BETTER NOW AND I WILL PUT THE
FACTS BEFORE YOU AS SHORTLY AND YET AS CLEARLY AS I CAN
IT IS OF COURSE WELL KNOWN TO YOU THAT IN A SUCCESSFUL BANKING
BUSINESS AS MUCH DEPENDS UPON OUR BEING ABLE TO FIND REMUNERATIVE
INVESTMENTS FOR OUR FUNDS AS UPON OUR INCREASING OUR CONNECTION
AND THE NUMBER OF OUR DEPOSITORS
ONE OF OUR MOST LUCRATIVE MEANS
OF LAYING OUT MONEY IS IN THE SHAPE OF LOANS WHERE THE SECURITY
IS UNIMPEACHABLE
WE HAVE DONE A GOOD DEAL IN THIS DIRECTION
DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THERE ARE MANY NOBLE FAMILIES TO
WHOM WE HAVE ADVANCED LARGE SUMS UPON THE SECURITY OF THEIR
PICTURES LIBRARIES OR PLATE
YESTERDAY MORNING I WAS SEATED IN MY OFFICE AT THE BANK WHEN A
CARD WAS BROUGHT IN TO ME BY ONE OF THE CLERKS
I STARTED WHEN I
SAW THE NAME FOR IT WAS THAT OF NONE OTHER THAN WELL PERHAPS
EVEN TO YOU I HAD BETTER SAY NO MORE THAN THAT IT WAS A NAME
WHICH IS A HOUSEHOLD WORD ALL OVER THE EARTH ONE OF THE HIGHEST
NOBLEST MOST EXALTED NAMES IN ENGLAND
I WAS OVERWHELMED BY THE
HONOUR AND ATTEMPTED WHEN HE ENTERED TO SAY SO BUT HE PLUNGED
AT ONCE INTO BUSINESS WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO WISHES TO HURRY
QUICKLY THROUGH A DISAGREEABLE TASK
'MR
HOLDER SAID HE 'I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT YOU ARE IN THE
HABIT OF ADVANCING MONEY
'THE FIRM DOES SO WHEN THE SECURITY IS GOOD I ANSWERED
'IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ME SAID HE 'THAT I SHOULD HAVE
50 000 POUNDS AT ONCE
I COULD OF COURSE BORROW SO TRIFLING A
SUM TEN TIMES OVER FROM MY FRIENDS BUT I MUCH PREFER TO MAKE IT
A MATTER OF BUSINESS AND TO CARRY OUT THAT BUSINESS MYSELF
IN MY
POSITION YOU CAN READILY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS UNWISE TO PLACE
ONE'S SELF UNDER OBLIGATIONS
'FOR HOW LONG MAY I ASK DO YOU WANT THIS SUM I ASKED
'NEXT MONDAY I HAVE A LARGE SUM DUE TO ME AND I SHALL THEN MOST
CERTAINLY REPAY WHAT YOU ADVANCE WITH WHATEVER INTEREST YOU
THINK IT RIGHT TO CHARGE
BUT IT IS VERY ESSENTIAL TO ME THAT THE
MONEY SHOULD BE PAID AT ONCE
'I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO ADVANCE IT WITHOUT FURTHER PARLEY FROM MY
OWN PRIVATE PURSE SAID I 'WERE IT NOT THAT THE STRAIN WOULD BE
RATHER MORE THAN IT COULD BEAR
IF ON THE OTHER HAND I AM TO DO
IT IN THE NAME OF THE FIRM THEN IN JUSTICE TO MY PARTNER I MUST
INSIST THAT EVEN IN YOUR CASE EVERY BUSINESSLIKE PRECAUTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN
'I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO HAVE IT SO SAID HE RAISING UP A
SQUARE BLACK MOROCCO CASE WHICH HE HAD LAID BESIDE HIS CHAIR
'YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS HEARD OF THE BERYL CORONET
'ONE OF THE MOST PRECIOUS PUBLIC POSSESSIONS OF THE EMPIRE
SAID I
'PRECISELY HE OPENED THE CASE AND THERE IMBEDDED IN SOFT
FLESH COLOURED VELVET LAY THE MAGNIFICENT PIECE OF JEWELLERY
WHICH HE HAD NAMED
'THERE ARE THIRTY NINE ENORMOUS BERYLS SAID
HE 'AND THE PRICE OF THE GOLD CHASING IS INCALCULABLE
THE
LOWEST ESTIMATE WOULD PUT THE WORTH OF THE CORONET AT DOUBLE THE
SUM WHICH I HAVE ASKED
I AM PREPARED TO LEAVE IT WITH YOU AS MY
SECURITY
I TOOK THE PRECIOUS CASE INTO MY HANDS AND LOOKED IN SOME
PERPLEXITY FROM IT TO MY ILLUSTRIOUS CLIENT
'YOU DOUBT ITS VALUE HE ASKED
'NOT AT ALL
I ONLY DOUBT
'THE PROPRIETY OF MY LEAVING IT
YOU MAY SET YOUR MIND AT REST
ABOUT THAT
I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF DOING SO WERE IT NOT ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE IN FOUR DAYS TO RECLAIM IT
IT IS A
PURE MATTER OF FORM
IS THE SECURITY SUFFICIENT
'AMPLE
'YOU UNDERSTAND MR
HOLDER THAT I AM GIVING YOU A STRONG PROOF
OF THE CONFIDENCE WHICH I HAVE IN YOU FOUNDED UPON ALL THAT I
HAVE HEARD OF YOU
I RELY UPON YOU NOT ONLY TO BE DISCREET AND TO
REFRAIN FROM ALL GOSSIP UPON THE MATTER BUT ABOVE ALL TO
PRESERVE THIS CORONET WITH EVERY POSSIBLE PRECAUTION BECAUSE I
NEED NOT SAY THAT A GREAT PUBLIC SCANDAL WOULD BE CAUSED IF ANY
HARM WERE TO BEFALL IT
ANY INJURY TO IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS
SERIOUS AS ITS COMPLETE LOSS FOR THERE ARE NO BERYLS IN THE
WORLD TO MATCH THESE AND IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE THEM
I LEAVE IT WITH YOU HOWEVER WITH EVERY CONFIDENCE AND I SHALL
CALL FOR IT IN PERSON ON MONDAY MORNING
SEEING THAT MY CLIENT WAS ANXIOUS TO LEAVE I SAID NO MORE BUT
CALLING FOR MY CASHIER I ORDERED HIM TO PAY OVER FIFTY 1000
POUND NOTES
WHEN I WAS ALONE ONCE MORE HOWEVER WITH THE
PRECIOUS CASE LYING UPON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF ME I COULD NOT
BUT THINK WITH SOME MISGIVINGS OF THE IMMENSE RESPONSIBILITY
WHICH IT ENTAILED UPON ME
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT THAT AS IT
WAS A NATIONAL POSSESSION A HORRIBLE SCANDAL WOULD ENSUE IF ANY
MISFORTUNE SHOULD OCCUR TO IT
I ALREADY REGRETTED HAVING EVER
CONSENTED TO TAKE CHARGE OF IT
HOWEVER IT WAS TOO LATE TO ALTER
THE MATTER NOW SO I LOCKED IT UP IN MY PRIVATE SAFE AND TURNED
ONCE MORE TO MY WORK
WHEN EVENING CAME I FELT THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPRUDENCE TO LEAVE
SO PRECIOUS A THING IN THE OFFICE BEHIND ME
BANKERS' SAFES HAD
BEEN FORCED BEFORE NOW AND WHY SHOULD NOT MINE BE IF SO HOW
TERRIBLE WOULD BE THE POSITION IN WHICH I SHOULD FIND MYSELF I
DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS I WOULD ALWAYS
CARRY THE CASE BACKWARD AND FORWARD WITH ME SO THAT IT MIGHT
NEVER BE REALLY OUT OF MY REACH
WITH THIS INTENTION I CALLED A
CAB AND DROVE OUT TO MY HOUSE AT STREATHAM CARRYING THE JEWEL
WITH ME
I DID NOT BREATHE FREELY UNTIL I HAD TAKEN IT UPSTAIRS
AND LOCKED IT IN THE BUREAU OF MY DRESSING ROOM
AND NOW A WORD AS TO MY HOUSEHOLD MR
HOLMES FOR I WISH YOU TO
THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION
MY GROOM AND MY PAGE SLEEP
OUT OF THE HOUSE AND MAY BE SET ASIDE ALTOGETHER
I HAVE THREE
MAID SERVANTS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH ME A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WHOSE
ABSOLUTE RELIABILITY IS QUITE ABOVE SUSPICION
ANOTHER LUCY
PARR THE SECOND WAITING MAID HAS ONLY BEEN IN MY SERVICE A FEW
MONTHS
SHE CAME WITH AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER HOWEVER AND HAS
ALWAYS GIVEN ME SATISFACTION
SHE IS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND HAS
ATTRACTED ADMIRERS WHO HAVE OCCASIONALLY HUNG ABOUT THE PLACE
THAT IS THE ONLY DRAWBACK WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO HER BUT WE
BELIEVE HER TO BE A THOROUGHLY GOOD GIRL IN EVERY WAY
SO MUCH FOR THE SERVANTS
MY FAMILY ITSELF IS SO SMALL THAT IT
WILL NOT TAKE ME LONG TO DESCRIBE IT
I AM A WIDOWER AND HAVE AN
ONLY SON ARTHUR
HE HAS BEEN A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME MR
HOLMES A GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I AM
MYSELF TO BLAME
PEOPLE TELL ME THAT I HAVE SPOILED HIM
VERY
LIKELY I HAVE
WHEN MY DEAR WIFE DIED I FELT THAT HE WAS ALL I
HAD TO LOVE
I COULD NOT BEAR TO SEE THE SMILE FADE EVEN FOR A
MOMENT FROM HIS FACE
I HAVE NEVER DENIED HIM A WISH
PERHAPS IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR BOTH OF US HAD I BEEN STERNER BUT I
MEANT IT FOR THE BEST
IT WAS NATURALLY MY INTENTION THAT HE SHOULD SUCCEED ME IN MY
BUSINESS BUT HE WAS NOT OF A BUSINESS TURN
HE WAS WILD
WAYWARD AND TO SPEAK THE TRUTH I COULD NOT TRUST HIM IN THE
HANDLING OF LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG HE BECAME A
MEMBER OF AN ARISTOCRATIC CLUB AND THERE HAVING CHARMING
MANNERS HE WAS SOON THE INTIMATE OF A NUMBER OF MEN WITH LONG
PURSES AND EXPENSIVE HABITS
HE LEARNED TO PLAY HEAVILY AT CARDS
AND TO SQUANDER MONEY ON THE TURF UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN
TO COME TO ME AND IMPLORE ME TO GIVE HIM AN ADVANCE UPON HIS
ALLOWANCE THAT HE MIGHT SETTLE HIS DEBTS OF HONOUR
HE TRIED
MORE THAN ONCE TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE DANGEROUS COMPANY WHICH HE
WAS KEEPING BUT EACH TIME THE INFLUENCE OF HIS FRIEND SIR
GEORGE BURNWELL WAS ENOUGH TO DRAW HIM BACK AGAIN
AND INDEED I COULD NOT WONDER THAT SUCH A MAN AS SIR GEORGE
BURNWELL SHOULD GAIN AN INFLUENCE OVER HIM FOR HE HAS FREQUENTLY
BROUGHT HIM TO MY HOUSE AND I HAVE FOUND MYSELF THAT I COULD
HARDLY RESIST THE FASCINATION OF HIS MANNER
HE IS OLDER THAN
ARTHUR A MAN OF THE WORLD TO HIS FINGER TIPS ONE WHO HAD BEEN
EVERYWHERE SEEN EVERYTHING A BRILLIANT TALKER AND A MAN OF
GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY
YET WHEN I THINK OF HIM IN COLD BLOOD FAR
AWAY FROM THE GLAMOUR OF HIS PRESENCE I AM CONVINCED FROM HIS
CYNICAL SPEECH AND THE LOOK WHICH I HAVE CAUGHT IN HIS EYES THAT
HE IS ONE WHO SHOULD BE DEEPLY DISTRUSTED
SO I THINK AND SO
TOO THINKS MY LITTLE MARY WHO HAS A WOMAN'S QUICK INSIGHT INTO
CHARACTER
AND NOW THERE IS ONLY SHE TO BE DESCRIBED
SHE IS MY NIECE BUT
WHEN MY BROTHER DIED FIVE YEARS AGO AND LEFT HER ALONE IN THE
WORLD I ADOPTED HER AND HAVE LOOKED UPON HER EVER SINCE AS MY
DAUGHTER
SHE IS A SUNBEAM IN MY HOUSE SWEET LOVING BEAUTIFUL
A WONDERFUL MANAGER AND HOUSEKEEPER YET AS TENDER AND QUIET AND
GENTLE AS A WOMAN COULD BE
SHE IS MY RIGHT HAND
I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT I COULD DO WITHOUT HER
IN ONLY ONE MATTER HAS SHE EVER GONE
AGAINST MY WISHES
TWICE MY BOY HAS ASKED HER TO MARRY HIM FOR
HE LOVES HER DEVOTEDLY BUT EACH TIME SHE HAS REFUSED HIM
I
THINK THAT IF ANYONE COULD HAVE DRAWN HIM INTO THE RIGHT PATH IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN SHE AND THAT HIS MARRIAGE MIGHT HAVE CHANGED HIS
WHOLE LIFE BUT NOW ALAS IT IS TOO LATE FOREVER TOO LATE
NOW MR
HOLMES YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE UNDER MY ROOF AND
I SHALL CONTINUE WITH MY MISERABLE STORY
WHEN WE WERE TAKING COFFEE IN THE DRAWING ROOM THAT NIGHT AFTER
DINNER I TOLD ARTHUR AND MARY MY EXPERIENCE AND OF THE PRECIOUS
TREASURE WHICH WE HAD UNDER OUR ROOF SUPPRESSING ONLY THE NAME
OF MY CLIENT
LUCY PARR WHO HAD BROUGHT IN THE COFFEE HAD I AM
SURE LEFT THE ROOM BUT I CANNOT SWEAR THAT THE DOOR WAS CLOSED
MARY AND ARTHUR WERE MUCH INTERESTED AND WISHED TO SEE THE FAMOUS
CORONET BUT I THOUGHT IT BETTER NOT TO DISTURB IT
'WHERE HAVE YOU PUT IT ASKED ARTHUR
'IN MY OWN BUREAU
'WELL I HOPE TO GOODNESS THE HOUSE WON'T BE BURGLED DURING THE
NIGHT SAID HE
'IT IS LOCKED UP I ANSWERED
'OH ANY OLD KEY WILL FIT THAT BUREAU
WHEN I WAS A YOUNGSTER I
HAVE OPENED IT MYSELF WITH THE KEY OF THE BOX ROOM CUPBOARD
HE OFTEN HAD A WILD WAY OF TALKING SO THAT I THOUGHT LITTLE OF
WHAT HE SAID
HE FOLLOWED ME TO MY ROOM HOWEVER THAT NIGHT WITH
A VERY GRAVE FACE
'LOOK HERE DAD SAID HE WITH HIS EYES CAST DOWN 'CAN YOU LET
ME HAVE 200 POUNDS
'NO I CANNOT I ANSWERED SHARPLY
'I HAVE BEEN FAR TOO
GENEROUS WITH YOU IN MONEY MATTERS
'YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND SAID HE 'BUT I MUST HAVE THIS MONEY
OR ELSE I CAN NEVER SHOW MY FACE INSIDE THE CLUB AGAIN
'AND A VERY GOOD THING TOO I CRIED
'YES BUT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME LEAVE IT A DISHONOURED MAN
SAID HE
'I COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
I MUST RAISE THE MONEY
IN SOME WAY AND IF YOU WILL NOT LET ME HAVE IT THEN I MUST TRY
OTHER MEANS
I WAS VERY ANGRY FOR THIS WAS THE THIRD DEMAND DURING THE
MONTH
'YOU SHALL NOT HAVE A FARTHING FROM ME I CRIED ON WHICH
HE BOWED AND LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
WHEN HE WAS GONE I UNLOCKED MY BUREAU MADE SURE THAT MY
TREASURE WAS SAFE AND LOCKED IT AGAIN
THEN I STARTED TO GO
ROUND THE HOUSE TO SEE THAT ALL WAS SECURE A DUTY WHICH I
USUALLY LEAVE TO MARY BUT WHICH I THOUGHT IT WELL TO PERFORM
MYSELF THAT NIGHT
AS I CAME DOWN THE STAIRS I SAW MARY HERSELF
AT THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE HALL WHICH SHE CLOSED AND FASTENED AS
I APPROACHED
'TELL ME DAD SAID SHE LOOKING I THOUGHT A LITTLE
DISTURBED 'DID YOU GIVE LUCY THE MAID LEAVE TO GO OUT
TO NIGHT
'CERTAINLY NOT
'SHE CAME IN JUST NOW BY THE BACK DOOR
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE
HAS ONLY BEEN TO THE SIDE GATE TO SEE SOMEONE BUT I THINK THAT
IT IS HARDLY SAFE AND SHOULD BE STOPPED
'YOU MUST SPEAK TO HER IN THE MORNING OR I WILL IF YOU PREFER
IT
ARE YOU SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS FASTENED
'QUITE SURE DAD
'THEN GOOD NIGHT I KISSED HER AND WENT UP TO MY BEDROOM
AGAIN WHERE I WAS SOON ASLEEP
I AM ENDEAVOURING TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING MR
HOLMES WHICH MAY
HAVE ANY BEARING UPON THE CASE BUT I BEG THAT YOU WILL QUESTION
ME UPON ANY POINT WHICH I DO NOT MAKE CLEAR
ON THE CONTRARY YOUR STATEMENT IS SINGULARLY LUCID
I COME TO A PART OF MY STORY NOW IN WHICH I SHOULD WISH TO BE
PARTICULARLY SO
I AM NOT A VERY HEAVY SLEEPER AND THE ANXIETY
IN MY MIND TENDED NO DOUBT TO MAKE ME EVEN LESS SO THAN USUAL
ABOUT TWO IN THE MORNING THEN I WAS AWAKENED BY SOME SOUND IN
THE HOUSE
IT HAD CEASED ERE I WAS WIDE AWAKE BUT IT HAD LEFT AN
IMPRESSION BEHIND IT AS THOUGH A WINDOW HAD GENTLY CLOSED
SOMEWHERE
I LAY LISTENING WITH ALL MY EARS
SUDDENLY TO MY
HORROR THERE WAS A DISTINCT SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS MOVING SOFTLY IN
THE NEXT ROOM
I SLIPPED OUT OF BED ALL PALPITATING WITH FEAR
AND PEEPED ROUND THE CORNER OF MY DRESSING ROOM DOOR
'ARTHUR I SCREAMED 'YOU VILLAIN YOU THIEF HOW DARE YOU
TOUCH THAT CORONET
THE GAS WAS HALF UP AS I HAD LEFT IT AND MY UNHAPPY BOY
DRESSED ONLY IN HIS SHIRT AND TROUSERS WAS STANDING BESIDE THE
LIGHT HOLDING THE CORONET IN HIS HANDS
HE APPEARED TO BE
WRENCHING AT IT OR BENDING IT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH
AT MY CRY
HE DROPPED IT FROM HIS GRASP AND TURNED AS PALE AS DEATH
I
SNATCHED IT UP AND EXAMINED IT
ONE OF THE GOLD CORNERS WITH
THREE OF THE BERYLS IN IT WAS MISSING
'YOU BLACKGUARD I SHOUTED BESIDE MYSELF WITH RAGE
'YOU HAVE
DESTROYED IT YOU HAVE DISHONOURED ME FOREVER WHERE ARE THE
JEWELS WHICH YOU HAVE STOLEN
'STOLEN HE CRIED
'YES THIEF I ROARED SHAKING HIM BY THE SHOULDER
'THERE ARE NONE MISSING
THERE CANNOT BE ANY MISSING SAID HE
'THERE ARE THREE MISSING
AND YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE
MUST I
CALL YOU A LIAR AS WELL AS A THIEF DID I NOT SEE YOU TRYING TO
TEAR OFF ANOTHER PIECE
'YOU HAVE CALLED ME NAMES ENOUGH SAID HE 'I WILL NOT STAND IT
ANY LONGER
I SHALL NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THIS BUSINESS
SINCE YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO INSULT ME
I WILL LEAVE YOUR HOUSE IN
THE MORNING AND MAKE MY OWN WAY IN THE WORLD
'YOU SHALL LEAVE IT IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE I CRIED
HALF MAD WITH GRIEF AND RAGE
'I SHALL HAVE THIS MATTER PROBED TO
THE BOTTOM
'YOU SHALL LEARN NOTHING FROM ME SAID HE WITH A PASSION SUCH
AS I SHOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT WAS IN HIS NATURE
'IF YOU CHOOSE TO
CALL THE POLICE LET THE POLICE FIND WHAT THEY CAN
BY THIS TIME THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS ASTIR FOR I HAD RAISED MY
VOICE IN MY ANGER
MARY WAS THE FIRST TO RUSH INTO MY ROOM AND
AT THE SIGHT OF THE CORONET AND OF ARTHUR'S FACE SHE READ THE
WHOLE STORY AND WITH A SCREAM FELL DOWN SENSELESS ON THE
GROUND
I SENT THE HOUSE MAID FOR THE POLICE AND PUT THE
INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR HANDS AT ONCE
WHEN THE INSPECTOR AND A
CONSTABLE ENTERED THE HOUSE ARTHUR WHO HAD STOOD SULLENLY WITH
HIS ARMS FOLDED ASKED ME WHETHER IT WAS MY INTENTION TO CHARGE
HIM WITH THEFT
I ANSWERED THAT IT HAD CEASED TO BE A PRIVATE
MATTER BUT HAD BECOME A PUBLIC ONE SINCE THE RUINED CORONET WAS
NATIONAL PROPERTY
I WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LAW SHOULD HAVE ITS
WAY IN EVERYTHING
'AT LEAST SAID HE 'YOU WILL NOT HAVE ME ARRESTED AT ONCE
IT
WOULD BE TO YOUR ADVANTAGE AS WELL AS MINE IF I MIGHT LEAVE THE
HOUSE FOR FIVE MINUTES
'THAT YOU MAY GET AWAY OR PERHAPS THAT YOU MAY CONCEAL WHAT YOU
HAVE STOLEN SAID I
AND THEN REALISING THE DREADFUL POSITION
IN WHICH I WAS PLACED I IMPLORED HIM TO REMEMBER THAT NOT ONLY
MY HONOUR BUT THAT OF ONE WHO WAS FAR GREATER THAN I WAS AT
STAKE AND THAT HE THREATENED TO RAISE A SCANDAL WHICH WOULD
CONVULSE THE NATION
HE MIGHT AVERT IT ALL IF HE WOULD BUT TELL
ME WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH THE THREE MISSING STONES
'YOU MAY AS WELL FACE THE MATTER SAID I 'YOU HAVE BEEN CAUGHT
IN THE ACT AND NO CONFESSION COULD MAKE YOUR GUILT MORE HEINOUS
IF YOU BUT MAKE SUCH REPARATION AS IS IN YOUR POWER BY TELLING
US WHERE THE BERYLS ARE ALL SHALL BE FORGIVEN AND FORGOTTEN
'KEEP YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR THOSE WHO ASK FOR IT HE ANSWERED
TURNING AWAY FROM ME WITH A SNEER
I SAW THAT HE WAS TOO HARDENED
FOR ANY WORDS OF MINE TO INFLUENCE HIM
THERE WAS BUT ONE WAY FOR
IT
I CALLED IN THE INSPECTOR AND GAVE HIM INTO CUSTODY
A SEARCH
WAS MADE AT ONCE NOT ONLY OF HIS PERSON BUT OF HIS ROOM AND OF
EVERY PORTION OF THE HOUSE WHERE HE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE CONCEALED
THE GEMS BUT NO TRACE OF THEM COULD BE FOUND NOR WOULD THE
WRETCHED BOY OPEN HIS MOUTH FOR ALL OUR PERSUASIONS AND OUR
THREATS
THIS MORNING HE WAS REMOVED TO A CELL AND I AFTER
GOING THROUGH ALL THE POLICE FORMALITIES HAVE HURRIED ROUND TO
YOU TO IMPLORE YOU TO USE YOUR SKILL IN UNRAVELLING THE MATTER
THE POLICE HAVE OPENLY CONFESSED THAT THEY CAN AT PRESENT MAKE
NOTHING OF IT
YOU MAY GO TO ANY EXPENSE WHICH YOU THINK
NECESSARY
I HAVE ALREADY OFFERED A REWARD OF 1000 POUNDS
MY
GOD WHAT SHALL I DO I HAVE LOST MY HONOUR MY GEMS AND MY SON
IN ONE NIGHT
OH WHAT SHALL I DO
HE PUT A HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD AND ROCKED HIMSELF TO
AND FRO DRONING TO HIMSELF LIKE A CHILD WHOSE GRIEF HAS GOT
BEYOND WORDS
SHERLOCK HOLMES SAT SILENT FOR SOME FEW MINUTES WITH HIS BROWS
KNITTED AND HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE FIRE
DO YOU RECEIVE MUCH COMPANY HE ASKED
NONE SAVE MY PARTNER WITH HIS FAMILY AND AN OCCASIONAL FRIEND OF
ARTHUR'S
SIR GEORGE BURNWELL HAS BEEN SEVERAL TIMES LATELY
NO
ONE ELSE I THINK
DO YOU GO OUT MUCH IN SOCIETY
ARTHUR DOES
MARY AND I STAY AT HOME
WE NEITHER OF US CARE FOR
IT
THAT IS UNUSUAL IN A YOUNG GIRL
SHE IS OF A QUIET NATURE
BESIDES SHE IS NOT SO VERY YOUNG
SHE
IS FOUR AND TWENTY
THIS MATTER FROM WHAT YOU SAY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SHOCK TO
HER ALSO
TERRIBLE SHE IS EVEN MORE AFFECTED THAN I
YOU HAVE NEITHER OF YOU ANY DOUBT AS TO YOUR SON'S GUILT
HOW CAN WE HAVE WHEN I SAW HIM WITH MY OWN EYES WITH THE CORONET
IN HIS HANDS
I HARDLY CONSIDER THAT A CONCLUSIVE PROOF
WAS THE REMAINDER OF
THE CORONET AT ALL INJURED
YES IT WAS TWISTED
DO YOU NOT THINK THEN THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
STRAIGHTEN IT
GOD BLESS YOU YOU ARE DOING WHAT YOU CAN FOR HIM AND FOR ME
BUT IT IS TOO HEAVY A TASK
WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE AT ALL IF
HIS PURPOSE WERE INNOCENT WHY DID HE NOT SAY SO
PRECISELY
AND IF IT WERE GUILTY WHY DID HE NOT INVENT A LIE
HIS SILENCE APPEARS TO ME TO CUT BOTH WAYS
THERE ARE SEVERAL
SINGULAR POINTS ABOUT THE CASE
WHAT DID THE POLICE THINK OF THE
NOISE WHICH AWOKE YOU FROM YOUR SLEEP
THEY CONSIDERED THAT IT MIGHT BE CAUSED BY ARTHUR'S CLOSING HIS
BEDROOM DOOR
A LIKELY STORY AS IF A MAN BENT ON FELONY WOULD SLAM HIS DOOR
SO AS TO WAKE A HOUSEHOLD
WHAT DID THEY SAY THEN OF THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF THESE GEMS
THEY ARE STILL SOUNDING THE PLANKING AND PROBING THE FURNITURE
IN THE HOPE OF FINDING THEM
HAVE THEY THOUGHT OF LOOKING OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
YES THEY HAVE SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY ENERGY
THE WHOLE GARDEN HAS
ALREADY BEEN MINUTELY EXAMINED
NOW MY DEAR SIR SAID HOLMES IS IT NOT OBVIOUS TO YOU NOW
THAT THIS MATTER REALLY STRIKES VERY MUCH DEEPER THAN EITHER YOU
OR THE POLICE WERE AT FIRST INCLINED TO THINK IT APPEARED TO YOU
TO BE A SIMPLE CASE TO ME IT SEEMS EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX
CONSIDER
WHAT IS INVOLVED BY YOUR THEORY
YOU SUPPOSE THAT YOUR SON CAME
DOWN FROM HIS BED WENT AT GREAT RISK TO YOUR DRESSING ROOM
OPENED YOUR BUREAU TOOK OUT YOUR CORONET BROKE OFF BY MAIN
FORCE A SMALL PORTION OF IT WENT OFF TO SOME OTHER PLACE
CONCEALED THREE GEMS OUT OF THE THIRTY NINE WITH SUCH SKILL THAT
NOBODY CAN FIND THEM AND THEN RETURNED WITH THE OTHER THIRTY SIX
INTO THE ROOM IN WHICH HE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO THE GREATEST DANGER
OF BEING DISCOVERED
I ASK YOU NOW IS SUCH A THEORY TENABLE
BUT WHAT OTHER IS THERE CRIED THE BANKER WITH A GESTURE OF
DESPAIR
IF HIS MOTIVES WERE INNOCENT WHY DOES HE NOT EXPLAIN
THEM
IT IS OUR TASK TO FIND THAT OUT REPLIED HOLMES SO NOW IF
YOU PLEASE MR
HOLDER WE WILL SET OFF FOR STREATHAM TOGETHER
AND DEVOTE AN HOUR TO GLANCING A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY INTO
DETAILS
MY FRIEND INSISTED UPON MY ACCOMPANYING THEM IN THEIR EXPEDITION
WHICH I WAS EAGER ENOUGH TO DO FOR MY CURIOSITY AND SYMPATHY
WERE DEEPLY STIRRED BY THE STORY TO WHICH WE HAD LISTENED
I
CONFESS THAT THE GUILT OF THE BANKER'S SON APPEARED TO ME TO BE
AS OBVIOUS AS IT DID TO HIS UNHAPPY FATHER BUT STILL I HAD SUCH
FAITH IN HOLMES' JUDGMENT THAT I FELT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME
GROUNDS FOR HOPE AS LONG AS HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE ACCEPTED
EXPLANATION
HE HARDLY SPOKE A WORD THE WHOLE WAY OUT TO THE
SOUTHERN SUBURB BUT SAT WITH HIS CHIN UPON HIS BREAST AND HIS
HAT DRAWN OVER HIS EYES SUNK IN THE DEEPEST THOUGHT
OUR CLIENT
APPEARED TO HAVE TAKEN FRESH HEART AT THE LITTLE GLIMPSE OF HOPE
WHICH HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HIM AND HE EVEN BROKE INTO A
DESULTORY CHAT WITH ME OVER HIS BUSINESS AFFAIRS
A SHORT RAILWAY
JOURNEY AND A SHORTER WALK BROUGHT US TO FAIRBANK THE MODEST
RESIDENCE OF THE GREAT FINANCIER
FAIRBANK WAS A GOOD SIZED SQUARE HOUSE OF WHITE STONE STANDING
BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ROAD
A DOUBLE CARRIAGE SWEEP WITH A
SNOW CLAD LAWN STRETCHED DOWN IN FRONT TO TWO LARGE IRON GATES
WHICH CLOSED THE ENTRANCE
ON THE RIGHT SIDE WAS A SMALL WOODEN
THICKET WHICH LED INTO A NARROW PATH BETWEEN TWO NEAT HEDGES
STRETCHING FROM THE ROAD TO THE KITCHEN DOOR AND FORMING THE
TRADESMEN'S ENTRANCE
ON THE LEFT RAN A LANE WHICH LED TO THE
STABLES AND WAS NOT ITSELF WITHIN THE GROUNDS AT ALL BEING A
PUBLIC THOUGH LITTLE USED THOROUGHFARE
HOLMES LEFT US STANDING
AT THE DOOR AND WALKED SLOWLY ALL ROUND THE HOUSE ACROSS THE
FRONT DOWN THE TRADESMEN'S PATH AND SO ROUND BY THE GARDEN
BEHIND INTO THE STABLE LANE
SO LONG WAS HE THAT MR
HOLDER AND I
WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM AND WAITED BY THE FIRE UNTIL HE SHOULD
RETURN
WE WERE SITTING THERE IN SILENCE WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND
A YOUNG LADY CAME IN
SHE WAS RATHER ABOVE THE MIDDLE HEIGHT
SLIM WITH DARK HAIR AND EYES WHICH SEEMED THE DARKER AGAINST
THE ABSOLUTE PALLOR OF HER SKIN
I DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE EVER
SEEN SUCH DEADLY PALENESS IN A WOMAN'S FACE
HER LIPS TOO WERE
BLOODLESS BUT HER EYES WERE FLUSHED WITH CRYING
AS SHE SWEPT
SILENTLY INTO THE ROOM SHE IMPRESSED ME WITH A GREATER SENSE OF
GRIEF THAN THE BANKER HAD DONE IN THE MORNING AND IT WAS THE
MORE STRIKING IN HER AS SHE WAS EVIDENTLY A WOMAN OF STRONG
CHARACTER WITH IMMENSE CAPACITY FOR SELF RESTRAINT
DISREGARDING
MY PRESENCE SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO HER UNCLE AND PASSED HER HAND
OVER HIS HEAD WITH A SWEET WOMANLY CARESS
YOU HAVE GIVEN ORDERS THAT ARTHUR SHOULD BE LIBERATED HAVE YOU
NOT DAD SHE ASKED
NO NO MY GIRL THE MATTER MUST BE PROBED TO THE BOTTOM
BUT I AM SO SURE THAT HE IS INNOCENT
YOU KNOW WHAT WOMAN'S
INSTINCTS ARE
I KNOW THAT HE HAS DONE NO HARM AND THAT YOU WILL
BE SORRY FOR HAVING ACTED SO HARSHLY
WHY IS HE SILENT THEN IF HE IS INNOCENT
WHO KNOWS PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS SO ANGRY THAT YOU SHOULD
SUSPECT HIM
HOW COULD I HELP SUSPECTING HIM WHEN I ACTUALLY SAW HIM WITH
THE CORONET IN HIS HAND
OH BUT HE HAD ONLY PICKED IT UP TO LOOK AT IT
OH DO DO TAKE
MY WORD FOR IT THAT HE IS INNOCENT
LET THE MATTER DROP AND SAY
NO MORE
IT IS SO DREADFUL TO THINK OF OUR DEAR ARTHUR IN
PRISON
I SHALL NEVER LET IT DROP UNTIL THE GEMS ARE FOUND NEVER MARY
YOUR AFFECTION FOR ARTHUR BLINDS YOU AS TO THE AWFUL CONSEQUENCES
TO ME
FAR FROM HUSHING THE THING UP I HAVE BROUGHT A GENTLEMAN
DOWN FROM LONDON TO INQUIRE MORE DEEPLY INTO IT
THIS GENTLEMAN SHE ASKED FACING ROUND TO ME
NO HIS FRIEND
HE WISHED US TO LEAVE HIM ALONE
HE IS ROUND IN
THE STABLE LANE NOW
THE STABLE LANE SHE RAISED HER DARK EYEBROWS
WHAT CAN HE
HOPE TO FIND THERE AH THIS I SUPPOSE IS HE
I TRUST SIR
THAT YOU WILL SUCCEED IN PROVING WHAT I FEEL SURE IS THE TRUTH
THAT MY COUSIN ARTHUR IS INNOCENT OF THIS CRIME
I FULLY SHARE YOUR OPINION AND I TRUST WITH YOU THAT WE MAY
PROVE IT RETURNED HOLMES GOING BACK TO THE MAT TO KNOCK THE
SNOW FROM HIS SHOES
I BELIEVE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF ADDRESSING
MISS MARY HOLDER
MIGHT I ASK YOU A QUESTION OR TWO
PRAY DO SIR IF IT MAY HELP TO CLEAR THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR UP
YOU HEARD NOTHING YOURSELF LAST NIGHT
NOTHING UNTIL MY UNCLE HERE BEGAN TO SPEAK LOUDLY
I HEARD
THAT AND I CAME DOWN
YOU SHUT UP THE WINDOWS AND DOORS THE NIGHT BEFORE
DID YOU
FASTEN ALL THE WINDOWS
YES
WERE THEY ALL FASTENED THIS MORNING
YES
YOU HAVE A MAID WHO HAS A SWEETHEART I THINK THAT YOU REMARKED
TO YOUR UNCLE LAST NIGHT THAT SHE HAD BEEN OUT TO SEE HIM
YES AND SHE WAS THE GIRL WHO WAITED IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND
WHO MAY HAVE HEARD UNCLE'S REMARKS ABOUT THE CORONET
I SEE
YOU INFER THAT SHE MAY HAVE GONE OUT TO TELL HER
SWEETHEART AND THAT THE TWO MAY HAVE PLANNED THE ROBBERY
BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ALL THESE VAGUE THEORIES CRIED THE
BANKER IMPATIENTLY WHEN I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I SAW ARTHUR WITH
THE CORONET IN HIS HANDS
WAIT A LITTLE MR
HOLDER
WE MUST COME BACK TO THAT
ABOUT THIS
GIRL MISS HOLDER
YOU SAW HER RETURN BY THE KITCHEN DOOR I
PRESUME
YES WHEN I WENT TO SEE IF THE DOOR WAS FASTENED FOR THE NIGHT I
MET HER SLIPPING IN
I SAW THE MAN TOO IN THE GLOOM
DO YOU KNOW HIM
OH YES HE IS THE GREEN GROCER WHO BRINGS OUR VEGETABLES ROUND
HIS NAME IS FRANCIS PROSPER
HE STOOD SAID HOLMES TO THE LEFT OF THE DOOR THAT IS TO
SAY FARTHER UP THE PATH THAN IS NECESSARY TO REACH THE DOOR
YES HE DID
AND HE IS A MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG
SOMETHING LIKE FEAR SPRANG UP IN THE YOUNG LADY'S EXPRESSIVE
BLACK EYES
WHY YOU ARE LIKE A MAGICIAN SAID SHE
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT SHE SMILED BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWERING SMILE IN
HOLMES' THIN EAGER FACE
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD NOW TO GO UPSTAIRS SAID HE
I SHALL
PROBABLY WISH TO GO OVER THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN
PERHAPS
I HAD BETTER TAKE A LOOK AT THE LOWER WINDOWS BEFORE I GO UP
HE WALKED SWIFTLY ROUND FROM ONE TO THE OTHER PAUSING ONLY AT
THE LARGE ONE WHICH LOOKED FROM THE HALL ONTO THE STABLE LANE
THIS HE OPENED AND MADE A VERY CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE SILL
WITH HIS POWERFUL MAGNIFYING LENS
NOW WE SHALL GO UPSTAIRS
SAID HE AT LAST
THE BANKER'S DRESSING ROOM WAS A PLAINLY FURNISHED LITTLE
CHAMBER WITH A GREY CARPET A LARGE BUREAU AND A LONG MIRROR
HOLMES WENT TO THE BUREAU FIRST AND LOOKED HARD AT THE LOCK
WHICH KEY WAS USED TO OPEN IT HE ASKED
THAT WHICH MY SON HIMSELF INDICATED THAT OF THE CUPBOARD OF THE
LUMBER ROOM
HAVE YOU IT HERE
THAT IS IT ON THE DRESSING TABLE
SHERLOCK HOLMES TOOK IT UP AND OPENED THE BUREAU
IT IS A NOISELESS LOCK SAID HE
IT IS NO WONDER THAT IT DID
NOT WAKE YOU
THIS CASE I PRESUME CONTAINS THE CORONET
WE MUST
HAVE A LOOK AT IT HE OPENED THE CASE AND TAKING OUT THE DIADEM
HE LAID IT UPON THE TABLE
IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPECIMEN OF THE
JEWELLER'S ART AND THE THIRTY SIX STONES WERE THE FINEST THAT I
HAVE EVER SEEN
AT ONE SIDE OF THE CORONET WAS A CRACKED EDGE
WHERE A CORNER HOLDING THREE GEMS HAD BEEN TORN AWAY
NOW MR
HOLDER SAID HOLMES HERE IS THE CORNER WHICH
CORRESPONDS TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN SO UNFORTUNATELY LOST
MIGHT I
BEG THAT YOU WILL BREAK IT OFF
THE BANKER RECOILED IN HORROR
I SHOULD NOT DREAM OF TRYING
SAID HE
THEN I WILL HOLMES SUDDENLY BENT HIS STRENGTH UPON IT BUT
WITHOUT RESULT
I FEEL IT GIVE A LITTLE SAID HE BUT THOUGH
I AM EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG IN THE FINGERS IT WOULD TAKE ME ALL MY
TIME TO BREAK IT
AN ORDINARY MAN COULD NOT DO IT
NOW WHAT DO
YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN IF I DID BREAK IT MR
HOLDER THERE WOULD
BE A NOISE LIKE A PISTOL SHOT
DO YOU TELL ME THAT ALL THIS
HAPPENED WITHIN A FEW YARDS OF YOUR BED AND THAT YOU HEARD
NOTHING OF IT
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK
IT IS ALL DARK TO ME
BUT PERHAPS IT MAY GROW LIGHTER AS WE GO
WHAT DO YOU THINK
MISS HOLDER
I CONFESS THAT I STILL SHARE MY UNCLE'S PERPLEXITY
YOUR SON HAD NO SHOES OR SLIPPERS ON WHEN YOU SAW HIM
HE HAD NOTHING ON SAVE ONLY HIS TROUSERS AND SHIRT
THANK YOU
WE HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN FAVOURED WITH EXTRAORDINARY
LUCK DURING THIS INQUIRY AND IT WILL BE ENTIRELY OUR OWN FAULT
IF WE DO NOT SUCCEED IN CLEARING THE MATTER UP
WITH YOUR
PERMISSION MR
HOLDER I SHALL NOW CONTINUE MY INVESTIGATIONS
OUTSIDE
HE WENT ALONE AT HIS OWN REQUEST FOR HE EXPLAINED THAT ANY
UNNECESSARY FOOTMARKS MIGHT MAKE HIS TASK MORE DIFFICULT
FOR AN
HOUR OR MORE HE WAS AT WORK RETURNING AT LAST WITH HIS FEET
HEAVY WITH SNOW AND HIS FEATURES AS INSCRUTABLE AS EVER
I THINK THAT I HAVE SEEN NOW ALL THAT THERE IS TO SEE MR
HOLDER SAID HE I CAN SERVE YOU BEST BY RETURNING TO MY
ROOMS
BUT THE GEMS MR
HOLMES
WHERE ARE THEY
I CANNOT TELL
THE BANKER WRUNG HIS HANDS
I SHALL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN HE
CRIED
AND MY SON YOU GIVE ME HOPES
MY OPINION IS IN NO WAY ALTERED
THEN FOR GOD'S SAKE WHAT WAS THIS DARK BUSINESS WHICH WAS
ACTED IN MY HOUSE LAST NIGHT
IF YOU CAN CALL UPON ME AT MY BAKER STREET ROOMS TO MORROW
MORNING BETWEEN NINE AND TEN I SHALL BE HAPPY TO DO WHAT I CAN TO
MAKE IT CLEARER
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU GIVE ME CARTE BLANCHE TO
ACT FOR YOU PROVIDED ONLY THAT I GET BACK THE GEMS AND THAT YOU
PLACE NO LIMIT ON THE SUM I MAY DRAW
I WOULD GIVE MY FORTUNE TO HAVE THEM BACK
VERY GOOD
I SHALL LOOK INTO THE MATTER BETWEEN THIS AND THEN
GOOD BYE IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT I MAY HAVE TO COME OVER HERE
AGAIN BEFORE EVENING
IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT MY COMPANION'S MIND WAS NOW MADE UP
ABOUT THE CASE ALTHOUGH WHAT HIS CONCLUSIONS WERE WAS MORE THAN
I COULD EVEN DIMLY IMAGINE
SEVERAL TIMES DURING OUR HOMEWARD
JOURNEY I ENDEAVOURED TO SOUND HIM UPON THE POINT BUT HE ALWAYS
GLIDED AWAY TO SOME OTHER TOPIC UNTIL AT LAST I GAVE IT OVER IN
DESPAIR
IT WAS NOT YET THREE WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES IN OUR
ROOMS ONCE MORE
HE HURRIED TO HIS CHAMBER AND WAS DOWN AGAIN IN
A FEW MINUTES DRESSED AS A COMMON LOAFER
WITH HIS COLLAR TURNED
UP HIS SHINY SEEDY COAT HIS RED CRAVAT AND HIS WORN BOOTS HE
WAS A PERFECT SAMPLE OF THE CLASS
I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD DO SAID HE GLANCING INTO THE GLASS
ABOVE THE FIREPLACE
I ONLY WISH THAT YOU COULD COME WITH ME
WATSON BUT I FEAR THAT IT WON'T DO
I MAY BE ON THE TRAIL IN
THIS MATTER OR I MAY BE FOLLOWING A WILL O' THE WISP BUT I
SHALL SOON KNOW WHICH IT IS
I HOPE THAT I MAY BE BACK IN A FEW
HOURS HE CUT A SLICE OF BEEF FROM THE JOINT UPON THE SIDEBOARD
SANDWICHED IT BETWEEN TWO ROUNDS OF BREAD AND THRUSTING THIS
RUDE MEAL INTO HIS POCKET HE STARTED OFF UPON HIS EXPEDITION
I HAD JUST FINISHED MY TEA WHEN HE RETURNED EVIDENTLY IN
EXCELLENT SPIRITS SWINGING AN OLD ELASTIC SIDED BOOT IN HIS
HAND
HE CHUCKED IT DOWN INTO A CORNER AND HELPED HIMSELF TO A
CUP OF TEA
I ONLY LOOKED IN AS I PASSED SAID HE
I AM GOING RIGHT ON
WHERE TO
OH TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WEST END
IT MAY BE SOME TIME
BEFORE I GET BACK
DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME IN CASE I SHOULD BE
LATE
HOW ARE YOU GETTING ON
OH SO SO
NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
I HAVE BEEN OUT TO STREATHAM
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST BUT I DID NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE
IT IS A
VERY SWEET LITTLE PROBLEM AND I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT FOR A
GOOD DEAL
HOWEVER I MUST NOT SIT GOSSIPING HERE BUT MUST GET
THESE DISREPUTABLE CLOTHES OFF AND RETURN TO MY HIGHLY
RESPECTABLE SELF
I COULD SEE BY HIS MANNER THAT HE HAD STRONGER REASONS FOR
SATISFACTION THAN HIS WORDS ALONE WOULD IMPLY
HIS EYES TWINKLED
AND THERE WAS EVEN A TOUCH OF COLOUR UPON HIS SALLOW CHEEKS
HE
HASTENED UPSTAIRS AND A FEW MINUTES LATER I HEARD THE SLAM OF
THE HALL DOOR WHICH TOLD ME THAT HE WAS OFF ONCE MORE UPON HIS
CONGENIAL HUNT
I WAITED UNTIL MIDNIGHT BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HIS RETURN SO
I RETIRED TO MY ROOM
IT WAS NO UNCOMMON THING FOR HIM TO BE AWAY
FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS ON END WHEN HE WAS HOT UPON A SCENT SO THAT
HIS LATENESS CAUSED ME NO SURPRISE
I DO NOT KNOW AT WHAT HOUR HE
CAME IN BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING THERE
HE WAS WITH A CUP OF COFFEE IN ONE HAND AND THE PAPER IN THE
OTHER AS FRESH AND TRIM AS POSSIBLE
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY BEGINNING WITHOUT YOU WATSON SAID HE BUT
YOU REMEMBER THAT OUR CLIENT HAS RATHER AN EARLY APPOINTMENT THIS
MORNING
WHY IT IS AFTER NINE NOW I ANSWERED
I SHOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED IF THAT WERE HE
I THOUGHT I HEARD A RING
IT WAS INDEED OUR FRIEND THE FINANCIER
I WAS SHOCKED BY THE
CHANGE WHICH HAD COME OVER HIM FOR HIS FACE WHICH WAS NATURALLY
OF A BROAD AND MASSIVE MOULD WAS NOW PINCHED AND FALLEN IN
WHILE HIS HAIR SEEMED TO ME AT LEAST A SHADE WHITER
HE ENTERED
WITH A WEARINESS AND LETHARGY WHICH WAS EVEN MORE PAINFUL THAN
HIS VIOLENCE OF THE MORNING BEFORE AND HE DROPPED HEAVILY INTO
THE ARMCHAIR WHICH I PUSHED FORWARD FOR HIM
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I HAVE DONE TO BE SO SEVERELY TRIED SAID
HE
ONLY TWO DAYS AGO I WAS A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS MAN WITHOUT
A CARE IN THE WORLD
NOW I AM LEFT TO A LONELY AND DISHONOURED
AGE
ONE SORROW COMES CLOSE UPON THE HEELS OF ANOTHER
MY NIECE
MARY HAS DESERTED ME
DESERTED YOU
YES
HER BED THIS MORNING HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT IN HER ROOM WAS
EMPTY AND A NOTE FOR ME LAY UPON THE HALL TABLE
I HAD SAID TO
HER LAST NIGHT IN SORROW AND NOT IN ANGER THAT IF SHE HAD
MARRIED MY BOY ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL WITH HIM
PERHAPS IT WAS
THOUGHTLESS OF ME TO SAY SO
IT IS TO THAT REMARK THAT SHE REFERS
IN THIS NOTE
'MY DEAREST UNCLE I FEEL THAT I HAVE BROUGHT TROUBLE UPON YOU
AND THAT IF I HAD ACTED DIFFERENTLY THIS TERRIBLE MISFORTUNE
MIGHT NEVER HAVE OCCURRED
I CANNOT WITH THIS THOUGHT IN MY
MIND EVER AGAIN BE HAPPY UNDER YOUR ROOF AND I FEEL THAT I MUST
LEAVE YOU FOREVER
DO NOT WORRY ABOUT MY FUTURE FOR THAT IS
PROVIDED FOR AND ABOVE ALL DO NOT SEARCH FOR ME FOR IT WILL
BE FRUITLESS LABOUR AND AN ILL SERVICE TO ME
IN LIFE OR IN
DEATH I AM EVER YOUR LOVING MARY
WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY THAT NOTE MR
HOLMES DO YOU THINK IT
POINTS TO SUICIDE
NO NO NOTHING OF THE KIND
IT IS PERHAPS THE BEST POSSIBLE
SOLUTION
I TRUST MR
HOLDER THAT YOU ARE NEARING THE END OF
YOUR TROUBLES
HA YOU SAY SO YOU HAVE HEARD SOMETHING MR
HOLMES YOU HAVE
LEARNED SOMETHING WHERE ARE THE GEMS
YOU WOULD NOT THINK 1000 POUNDS APIECE AN EXCESSIVE SUM FOR
THEM
I WOULD PAY TEN
THAT WOULD BE UNNECESSARY
THREE THOUSAND WILL COVER THE MATTER
AND THERE IS A LITTLE REWARD I FANCY
HAVE YOU YOUR CHECK BOOK
HERE IS A PEN
BETTER MAKE IT OUT FOR 4000 POUNDS
WITH A DAZED FACE THE BANKER MADE OUT THE REQUIRED CHECK
HOLMES
WALKED OVER TO HIS DESK TOOK OUT A LITTLE TRIANGULAR PIECE OF
GOLD WITH THREE GEMS IN IT AND THREW IT DOWN UPON THE TABLE
WITH A SHRIEK OF JOY OUR CLIENT CLUTCHED IT UP
YOU HAVE IT HE GASPED
I AM SAVED I AM SAVED
THE REACTION OF JOY WAS AS PASSIONATE AS HIS GRIEF HAD BEEN AND
HE HUGGED HIS RECOVERED GEMS TO HIS BOSOM
THERE IS ONE OTHER THING YOU OWE MR
HOLDER SAID SHERLOCK
HOLMES RATHER STERNLY
OWE HE CAUGHT UP A PEN
NAME THE SUM AND I WILL PAY IT
NO THE DEBT IS NOT TO ME
YOU OWE A VERY HUMBLE APOLOGY TO THAT
NOBLE LAD YOUR SON WHO HAS CARRIED HIMSELF IN THIS MATTER AS I
SHOULD BE PROUD TO SEE MY OWN SON DO SHOULD I EVER CHANCE TO
HAVE ONE
THEN IT WAS NOT ARTHUR WHO TOOK THEM
I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY AND I REPEAT TO DAY THAT IT WAS NOT
YOU ARE SURE OF IT THEN LET US HURRY TO HIM AT ONCE TO LET HIM
KNOW THAT THE TRUTH IS KNOWN
HE KNOWS IT ALREADY
WHEN I HAD CLEARED IT ALL UP I HAD AN
INTERVIEW WITH HIM AND FINDING THAT HE WOULD NOT TELL ME THE
STORY I TOLD IT TO HIM ON WHICH HE HAD TO CONFESS THAT I WAS
RIGHT AND TO ADD THE VERY FEW DETAILS WHICH WERE NOT YET QUITE
CLEAR TO ME
YOUR NEWS OF THIS MORNING HOWEVER MAY OPEN HIS
LIPS
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THIS EXTRAORDINARY
MYSTERY
I WILL DO SO AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE STEPS BY WHICH I REACHED
IT
AND LET ME SAY TO YOU FIRST THAT WHICH IT IS HARDEST FOR ME
TO SAY AND FOR YOU TO HEAR THERE HAS BEEN AN UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN SIR GEORGE BURNWELL AND YOUR NIECE MARY
THEY HAVE NOW
FLED TOGETHER
MY MARY IMPOSSIBLE
IT IS UNFORTUNATELY MORE THAN POSSIBLE IT IS CERTAIN
NEITHER
YOU NOR YOUR SON KNEW THE TRUE CHARACTER OF THIS MAN WHEN YOU
ADMITTED HIM INTO YOUR FAMILY CIRCLE
HE IS ONE OF THE MOST
DANGEROUS MEN IN ENGLAND A RUINED GAMBLER AN ABSOLUTELY
DESPERATE VILLAIN A MAN WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE
YOUR NIECE
KNEW NOTHING OF SUCH MEN
WHEN HE BREATHED HIS VOWS TO HER AS HE
HAD DONE TO A HUNDRED BEFORE HER SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE
ALONE HAD TOUCHED HIS HEART
THE DEVIL KNOWS BEST WHAT HE SAID
BUT AT LEAST SHE BECAME HIS TOOL AND WAS IN THE HABIT OF SEEING
HIM NEARLY EVERY EVENING
I CANNOT AND I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT CRIED THE BANKER WITH AN
ASHEN FACE
I WILL TELL YOU THEN WHAT OCCURRED IN YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT
YOUR NIECE WHEN YOU HAD AS SHE THOUGHT GONE TO YOUR ROOM
SLIPPED DOWN AND TALKED TO HER LOVER THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH
LEADS INTO THE STABLE LANE
HIS FOOTMARKS HAD PRESSED RIGHT
THROUGH THE SNOW SO LONG HAD HE STOOD THERE
SHE TOLD HIM OF THE
CORONET
HIS WICKED LUST FOR GOLD KINDLED AT THE NEWS AND HE
BENT HER TO HIS WILL
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE LOVED YOU BUT
THERE ARE WOMEN IN WHOM THE LOVE OF A LOVER EXTINGUISHES ALL
OTHER LOVES AND I THINK THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN ONE
SHE HAD
HARDLY LISTENED TO HIS INSTRUCTIONS WHEN SHE SAW YOU COMING
DOWNSTAIRS ON WHICH SHE CLOSED THE WINDOW RAPIDLY AND TOLD YOU
ABOUT ONE OF THE SERVANTS' ESCAPADE WITH HER WOODEN LEGGED LOVER
WHICH WAS ALL PERFECTLY TRUE
YOUR BOY ARTHUR WENT TO BED AFTER HIS INTERVIEW WITH YOU BUT
HE SLEPT BADLY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS UNEASINESS ABOUT HIS CLUB DEBTS
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE HEARD A SOFT TREAD PASS HIS DOOR
SO HE ROSE AND LOOKING OUT WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIS COUSIN
WALKING VERY STEALTHILY ALONG THE PASSAGE UNTIL SHE DISAPPEARED
INTO YOUR DRESSING ROOM
PETRIFIED WITH ASTONISHMENT THE LAD
SLIPPED ON SOME CLOTHES AND WAITED THERE IN THE DARK TO SEE WHAT
WOULD COME OF THIS STRANGE AFFAIR
PRESENTLY SHE EMERGED FROM THE
ROOM AGAIN AND IN THE LIGHT OF THE PASSAGE LAMP YOUR SON SAW
THAT SHE CARRIED THE PRECIOUS CORONET IN HER HANDS
SHE PASSED
DOWN THE STAIRS AND HE THRILLING WITH HORROR RAN ALONG AND
SLIPPED BEHIND THE CURTAIN NEAR YOUR DOOR WHENCE HE COULD SEE
WHAT PASSED IN THE HALL BENEATH
HE SAW HER STEALTHILY OPEN THE
WINDOW HAND OUT THE CORONET TO SOMEONE IN THE GLOOM AND THEN
CLOSING IT ONCE MORE HURRY BACK TO HER ROOM PASSING QUITE CLOSE
TO WHERE HE STOOD HID BEHIND THE CURTAIN
AS LONG AS SHE WAS ON THE SCENE HE COULD NOT TAKE ANY ACTION
WITHOUT A HORRIBLE EXPOSURE OF THE WOMAN WHOM HE LOVED
BUT THE
INSTANT THAT SHE WAS GONE HE REALISED HOW CRUSHING A MISFORTUNE
THIS WOULD BE FOR YOU AND HOW ALL IMPORTANT IT WAS TO SET IT
RIGHT
HE RUSHED DOWN JUST AS HE WAS IN HIS BARE FEET OPENED
THE WINDOW SPRANG OUT INTO THE SNOW AND RAN DOWN THE LANE
WHERE HE COULD SEE A DARK FIGURE IN THE MOONLIGHT
SIR GEORGE
BURNWELL TRIED TO GET AWAY BUT ARTHUR CAUGHT HIM AND THERE WAS
A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THEM YOUR LAD TUGGING AT ONE SIDE OF THE
CORONET AND HIS OPPONENT AT THE OTHER
IN THE SCUFFLE YOUR SON
STRUCK SIR GEORGE AND CUT HIM OVER THE EYE
THEN SOMETHING
SUDDENLY SNAPPED AND YOUR SON FINDING THAT HE HAD THE CORONET
IN HIS HANDS RUSHED BACK CLOSED THE WINDOW ASCENDED TO YOUR
ROOM AND HAD JUST OBSERVED THAT THE CORONET HAD BEEN TWISTED IN
THE STRUGGLE AND WAS ENDEAVOURING TO STRAIGHTEN IT WHEN YOU
APPEARED UPON THE SCENE
IS IT POSSIBLE GASPED THE BANKER
YOU THEN ROUSED HIS ANGER BY CALLING HIM NAMES AT A MOMENT WHEN
HE FELT THAT HE HAD DESERVED YOUR WARMEST THANKS
HE COULD NOT
EXPLAIN THE TRUE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITHOUT BETRAYING ONE WHO
CERTAINLY DESERVED LITTLE ENOUGH CONSIDERATION AT HIS HANDS
HE
TOOK THE MORE CHIVALROUS VIEW HOWEVER AND PRESERVED HER
SECRET
AND THAT WAS WHY SHE SHRIEKED AND FAINTED WHEN SHE SAW THE
CORONET CRIED MR
HOLDER
OH MY GOD WHAT A BLIND FOOL I HAVE
BEEN AND HIS ASKING TO BE ALLOWED TO GO OUT FOR FIVE MINUTES
THE DEAR FELLOW WANTED TO SEE IF THE MISSING PIECE WERE AT THE
SCENE OF THE STRUGGLE
HOW CRUELLY I HAVE MISJUDGED HIM
WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE CONTINUED HOLMES I AT ONCE WENT
VERY CAREFULLY ROUND IT TO OBSERVE IF THERE WERE ANY TRACES IN
THE SNOW WHICH MIGHT HELP ME
I KNEW THAT NONE HAD FALLEN SINCE
THE EVENING BEFORE AND ALSO THAT THERE HAD BEEN A STRONG FROST
TO PRESERVE IMPRESSIONS
I PASSED ALONG THE TRADESMEN'S PATH BUT
FOUND IT ALL TRAMPLED DOWN AND INDISTINGUISHABLE
JUST BEYOND IT
HOWEVER AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE KITCHEN DOOR A WOMAN HAD STOOD
AND TALKED WITH A MAN WHOSE ROUND IMPRESSIONS ON ONE SIDE SHOWED
THAT HE HAD A WOODEN LEG
I COULD EVEN TELL THAT THEY HAD BEEN
DISTURBED FOR THE WOMAN HAD RUN BACK SWIFTLY TO THE DOOR AS WAS
SHOWN BY THE DEEP TOE AND LIGHT HEEL MARKS WHILE WOODEN LEG HAD
WAITED A LITTLE AND THEN HAD GONE AWAY
I THOUGHT AT THE TIME
THAT THIS MIGHT BE THE MAID AND HER SWEETHEART OF WHOM YOU HAD
ALREADY SPOKEN TO ME AND INQUIRY SHOWED IT WAS SO
I PASSED
ROUND THE GARDEN WITHOUT SEEING ANYTHING MORE THAN RANDOM TRACKS
WHICH I TOOK TO BE THE POLICE BUT WHEN I GOT INTO THE STABLE
LANE A VERY LONG AND COMPLEX STORY WAS WRITTEN IN THE SNOW IN
FRONT OF ME
THERE WAS A DOUBLE LINE OF TRACKS OF A BOOTED MAN AND A SECOND
DOUBLE LINE WHICH I SAW WITH DELIGHT BELONGED TO A MAN WITH NAKED
FEET
I WAS AT ONCE CONVINCED FROM WHAT YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THE
LATTER WAS YOUR SON
THE FIRST HAD WALKED BOTH WAYS BUT THE
OTHER HAD RUN SWIFTLY AND AS HIS TREAD WAS MARKED IN PLACES OVER
THE DEPRESSION OF THE BOOT IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE HAD PASSED
AFTER THE OTHER
I FOLLOWED THEM UP AND FOUND THEY LED TO THE
HALL WINDOW WHERE BOOTS HAD WORN ALL THE SNOW AWAY WHILE
WAITING
THEN I WALKED TO THE OTHER END WHICH WAS A HUNDRED
YARDS OR MORE DOWN THE LANE
I SAW WHERE BOOTS HAD FACED ROUND
WHERE THE SNOW WAS CUT UP AS THOUGH THERE HAD BEEN A STRUGGLE
AND FINALLY WHERE A FEW DROPS OF BLOOD HAD FALLEN TO SHOW ME
THAT I WAS NOT MISTAKEN
BOOTS HAD THEN RUN DOWN THE LANE AND
ANOTHER LITTLE SMUDGE OF BLOOD SHOWED THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD BEEN
HURT
WHEN HE CAME TO THE HIGHROAD AT THE OTHER END I FOUND THAT
THE PAVEMENT HAD BEEN CLEARED SO THERE WAS AN END TO THAT CLUE
ON ENTERING THE HOUSE HOWEVER I EXAMINED AS YOU REMEMBER THE
SILL AND FRAMEWORK OF THE HALL WINDOW WITH MY LENS AND I COULD
AT ONCE SEE THAT SOMEONE HAD PASSED OUT
I COULD DISTINGUISH THE
OUTLINE OF AN INSTEP WHERE THE WET FOOT HAD BEEN PLACED IN COMING
IN
I WAS THEN BEGINNING TO BE ABLE TO FORM AN OPINION AS TO WHAT
HAD OCCURRED
A MAN HAD WAITED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW SOMEONE HAD
BROUGHT THE GEMS THE DEED HAD BEEN OVERSEEN BY YOUR SON HE HAD
PURSUED THE THIEF HAD STRUGGLED WITH HIM THEY HAD EACH TUGGED
AT THE CORONET THEIR UNITED STRENGTH CAUSING INJURIES WHICH
NEITHER ALONE COULD HAVE EFFECTED
HE HAD RETURNED WITH THE
PRIZE BUT HAD LEFT A FRAGMENT IN THE GRASP OF HIS OPPONENT
SO
FAR I WAS CLEAR
THE QUESTION NOW WAS WHO WAS THE MAN AND WHO
WAS IT BROUGHT HIM THE CORONET
IT IS AN OLD MAXIM OF MINE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE EXCLUDED THE
IMPOSSIBLE WHATEVER REMAINS HOWEVER IMPROBABLE MUST BE THE
TRUTH
NOW I KNEW THAT IT WAS NOT YOU WHO HAD BROUGHT IT DOWN
SO THERE ONLY REMAINED YOUR NIECE AND THE MAIDS
BUT IF IT WERE
THE MAIDS WHY SHOULD YOUR SON ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE ACCUSED IN
THEIR PLACE THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE REASON
AS HE LOVED HIS
COUSIN HOWEVER THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT EXPLANATION WHY HE SHOULD
RETAIN HER SECRET THE MORE SO AS THE SECRET WAS A DISGRACEFUL
ONE
WHEN I REMEMBERED THAT YOU HAD SEEN HER AT THAT WINDOW AND
HOW SHE HAD FAINTED ON SEEING THE CORONET AGAIN MY CONJECTURE
BECAME A CERTAINTY
AND WHO COULD IT BE WHO WAS HER CONFEDERATE A LOVER EVIDENTLY
FOR WHO ELSE COULD OUTWEIGH THE LOVE AND GRATITUDE WHICH SHE MUST
FEEL TO YOU I KNEW THAT YOU WENT OUT LITTLE AND THAT YOUR
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS WAS A VERY LIMITED ONE
BUT AMONG THEM WAS SIR
GEORGE BURNWELL
I HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AS BEING A MAN OF EVIL
REPUTATION AMONG WOMEN
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HE WHO WORE THOSE BOOTS
AND RETAINED THE MISSING GEMS
EVEN THOUGH HE KNEW THAT ARTHUR
HAD DISCOVERED HIM HE MIGHT STILL FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE WAS
SAFE FOR THE LAD COULD NOT SAY A WORD WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS
OWN FAMILY
WELL YOUR OWN GOOD SENSE WILL SUGGEST WHAT MEASURES I TOOK
NEXT
I WENT IN THE SHAPE OF A LOAFER TO SIR GEORGE'S HOUSE
MANAGED TO PICK UP AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS VALET LEARNED THAT
HIS MASTER HAD CUT HIS HEAD THE NIGHT BEFORE AND FINALLY AT
THE EXPENSE OF SIX SHILLINGS MADE ALL SURE BY BUYING A PAIR OF
HIS CAST OFF SHOES
WITH THESE I JOURNEYED DOWN TO STREATHAM AND
SAW THAT THEY EXACTLY FITTED THE TRACKS
I SAW AN ILL DRESSED VAGABOND IN THE LANE YESTERDAY EVENING
SAID MR
HOLDER
PRECISELY
IT WAS I
I FOUND THAT I HAD MY MAN SO I CAME HOME
AND CHANGED MY CLOTHES
IT WAS A DELICATE PART WHICH I HAD TO
PLAY THEN FOR I SAW THAT A PROSECUTION MUST BE AVOIDED TO AVERT
SCANDAL AND I KNEW THAT SO ASTUTE A VILLAIN WOULD SEE THAT OUR
HANDS WERE TIED IN THE MATTER
I WENT AND SAW HIM
AT FIRST OF
COURSE HE DENIED EVERYTHING
BUT WHEN I GAVE HIM EVERY
PARTICULAR THAT HAD OCCURRED HE TRIED TO BLUSTER AND TOOK DOWN A
LIFE PRESERVER FROM THE WALL
I KNEW MY MAN HOWEVER AND I
CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD BEFORE HE COULD STRIKE
THEN HE
BECAME A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE
I TOLD HIM THAT WE WOULD GIVE
HIM A PRICE FOR THE STONES HE HELD 1000 POUNDS APIECE
THAT
BROUGHT OUT THE FIRST SIGNS OF GRIEF THAT HE HAD SHOWN
'WHY
DASH IT ALL SAID HE 'I'VE LET THEM GO AT SIX HUNDRED FOR THE
THREE I SOON MANAGED TO GET THE ADDRESS OF THE RECEIVER WHO HAD
THEM ON PROMISING HIM THAT THERE WOULD BE NO PROSECUTION
OFF I
SET TO HIM AND AFTER MUCH CHAFFERING I GOT OUR STONES AT 1000
POUNDS APIECE
THEN I LOOKED IN UPON YOUR SON TOLD HIM THAT ALL
WAS RIGHT AND EVENTUALLY GOT TO MY BED ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK AFTER
WHAT I MAY CALL A REALLY HARD DAY'S WORK
A DAY WHICH HAS SAVED ENGLAND FROM A GREAT PUBLIC SCANDAL SAID
THE BANKER RISING
SIR I CANNOT FIND WORDS TO THANK YOU BUT
YOU SHALL NOT FIND ME UNGRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE
YOUR
SKILL HAS INDEED EXCEEDED ALL THAT I HAVE HEARD OF IT
AND NOW I
MUST FLY TO MY DEAR BOY TO APOLOGISE TO HIM FOR THE WRONG WHICH I
HAVE DONE HIM
AS TO WHAT YOU TELL ME OF POOR MARY IT GOES TO MY
VERY HEART
NOT EVEN YOUR SKILL CAN INFORM ME WHERE SHE IS NOW
I THINK THAT WE MAY SAFELY SAY RETURNED HOLMES THAT SHE IS
WHEREVER SIR GEORGE BURNWELL IS
IT IS EQUALLY CERTAIN TOO THAT
WHATEVER HER SINS ARE THEY WILL SOON RECEIVE A MORE THAN
SUFFICIENT PUNISHMENT
XII
THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
TO THE MAN WHO LOVES ART FOR ITS OWN SAKE REMARKED SHERLOCK
HOLMES TOSSING ASIDE THE ADVERTISEMENT SHEET OF THE DAILY
TELEGRAPH IT IS FREQUENTLY IN ITS LEAST IMPORTANT AND LOWLIEST
MANIFESTATIONS THAT THE KEENEST PLEASURE IS TO BE DERIVED
IT IS
PLEASANT TO ME TO OBSERVE WATSON THAT YOU HAVE SO FAR GRASPED
THIS TRUTH THAT IN THESE LITTLE RECORDS OF OUR CASES WHICH YOU
HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO DRAW UP AND I AM BOUND TO SAY
OCCASIONALLY TO EMBELLISH YOU HAVE GIVEN PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH
TO THE MANY CAUSES CLBRES AND SENSATIONAL TRIALS IN WHICH I
HAVE FIGURED BUT RATHER TO THOSE INCIDENTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN
TRIVIAL IN THEMSELVES BUT WHICH HAVE GIVEN ROOM FOR THOSE
FACULTIES OF DEDUCTION AND OF LOGICAL SYNTHESIS WHICH I HAVE MADE
MY SPECIAL PROVINCE
AND YET SAID I SMILING I CANNOT QUITE HOLD MYSELF ABSOLVED
FROM THE CHARGE OF SENSATIONALISM WHICH HAS BEEN URGED AGAINST MY
RECORDS
YOU HAVE ERRED PERHAPS HE OBSERVED TAKING UP A GLOWING
CINDER WITH THE TONGS AND LIGHTING WITH IT THE LONG CHERRY WOOD
PIPE WHICH WAS WONT TO REPLACE HIS CLAY WHEN HE WAS IN A
DISPUTATIOUS RATHER THAN A MEDITATIVE MOOD YOU HAVE ERRED
PERHAPS IN ATTEMPTING TO PUT COLOUR AND LIFE INTO EACH OF YOUR
STATEMENTS INSTEAD OF CONFINING YOURSELF TO THE TASK OF PLACING
UPON RECORD THAT SEVERE REASONING FROM CAUSE TO EFFECT WHICH IS
REALLY THE ONLY NOTABLE FEATURE ABOUT THE THING
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I HAVE DONE YOU FULL JUSTICE IN THE MATTER
I REMARKED WITH SOME COLDNESS FOR I WAS REPELLED BY THE EGOTISM
WHICH I HAD MORE THAN ONCE OBSERVED TO BE A STRONG FACTOR IN MY
FRIEND'S SINGULAR CHARACTER
NO IT IS NOT SELFISHNESS OR CONCEIT SAID HE ANSWERING AS
WAS HIS WONT MY THOUGHTS RATHER THAN MY WORDS
IF I CLAIM FULL
JUSTICE FOR MY ART IT IS BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPERSONAL THING A
THING BEYOND MYSELF
CRIME IS COMMON
LOGIC IS RARE
THEREFORE IT
IS UPON THE LOGIC RATHER THAN UPON THE CRIME THAT YOU SHOULD
DWELL
YOU HAVE DEGRADED WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A COURSE OF
LECTURES INTO A SERIES OF TALES
IT WAS A COLD MORNING OF THE EARLY SPRING AND WE SAT AFTER
BREAKFAST ON EITHER SIDE OF A CHEERY FIRE IN THE OLD ROOM AT
BAKER STREET
A THICK FOG ROLLED DOWN BETWEEN THE LINES OF
DUN COLOURED HOUSES AND THE OPPOSING WINDOWS LOOMED LIKE DARK
SHAPELESS BLURS THROUGH THE HEAVY YELLOW WREATHS
OUR GAS WAS LIT
AND SHONE ON THE WHITE CLOTH AND GLIMMER OF CHINA AND METAL FOR
THE TABLE HAD NOT BEEN CLEARED YET
SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD BEEN
SILENT ALL THE MORNING DIPPING CONTINUOUSLY INTO THE
ADVERTISEMENT COLUMNS OF A SUCCESSION OF PAPERS UNTIL AT LAST
HAVING APPARENTLY GIVEN UP HIS SEARCH HE HAD EMERGED IN NO VERY
SWEET TEMPER TO LECTURE ME UPON MY LITERARY SHORTCOMINGS
AT THE SAME TIME HE REMARKED AFTER A PAUSE DURING WHICH HE
HAD SAT PUFFING AT HIS LONG PIPE AND GAZING DOWN INTO THE FIRE
YOU CAN HARDLY BE OPEN TO A CHARGE OF SENSATIONALISM FOR OUT OF
THESE CASES WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND AS TO INTEREST YOURSELF
IN A FAIR PROPORTION DO NOT TREAT OF CRIME IN ITS LEGAL SENSE
AT ALL
THE SMALL MATTER IN WHICH I ENDEAVOURED TO HELP THE KING
OF BOHEMIA THE SINGULAR EXPERIENCE OF MISS MARY SUTHERLAND THE
PROBLEM CONNECTED WITH THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP AND THE
INCIDENT OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR WERE ALL MATTERS WHICH ARE
OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THE LAW
BUT IN AVOIDING THE SENSATIONAL I
FEAR THAT YOU MAY HAVE BORDERED ON THE TRIVIAL
THE END MAY HAVE BEEN SO I ANSWERED BUT THE METHODS I HOLD
TO HAVE BEEN NOVEL AND OF INTEREST
PSHAW MY DEAR FELLOW WHAT DO THE PUBLIC THE GREAT UNOBSERVANT
PUBLIC WHO COULD HARDLY TELL A WEAVER BY HIS TOOTH OR A
COMPOSITOR BY HIS LEFT THUMB CARE ABOUT THE FINER SHADES OF
ANALYSIS AND DEDUCTION BUT INDEED IF YOU ARE TRIVIAL I CANNOT
BLAME YOU FOR THE DAYS OF THE GREAT CASES ARE PAST
MAN OR AT
LEAST CRIMINAL MAN HAS LOST ALL ENTERPRISE AND ORIGINALITY
AS
TO MY OWN LITTLE PRACTICE IT SEEMS TO BE DEGENERATING INTO AN
AGENCY FOR RECOVERING LOST LEAD PENCILS AND GIVING ADVICE TO
YOUNG LADIES FROM BOARDING SCHOOLS
I THINK THAT I HAVE TOUCHED
BOTTOM AT LAST HOWEVER
THIS NOTE I HAD THIS MORNING MARKS MY
ZERO POINT I FANCY
READ IT HE TOSSED A CRUMPLED LETTER ACROSS
TO ME
IT WAS DATED FROM MONTAGUE PLACE UPON THE PRECEDING EVENING AND
RAN THUS
DEAR MR
HOLMES I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO CONSULT YOU AS TO WHETHER
I SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT ACCEPT A SITUATION WHICH HAS BEEN OFFERED
TO ME AS GOVERNESS
I SHALL CALL AT HALF PAST TEN TO MORROW IF I
DO NOT INCONVENIENCE YOU
YOURS FAITHFULLY
VIOLET HUNTER
DO YOU KNOW THE YOUNG LADY I ASKED
NOT I
IT IS HALF PAST TEN NOW
YES AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IS HER RING
IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE OF MORE INTEREST THAN YOU THINK
YOU
REMEMBER THAT THE AFFAIR OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE WHICH APPEARED TO
BE A MERE WHIM AT FIRST DEVELOPED INTO A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION
IT MAY BE SO IN THIS CASE ALSO
WELL LET US HOPE SO
BUT OUR DOUBTS WILL VERY SOON BE SOLVED
FOR HERE UNLESS I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IS THE PERSON IN QUESTION
AS HE SPOKE THE DOOR OPENED AND A YOUNG LADY ENTERED THE ROOM
SHE WAS PLAINLY BUT NEATLY DRESSED WITH A BRIGHT QUICK FACE
FRECKLED LIKE A PLOVER'S EGG AND WITH THE BRISK MANNER OF A
WOMAN WHO HAS HAD HER OWN WAY TO MAKE IN THE WORLD
YOU WILL EXCUSE MY TROUBLING YOU I AM SURE SAID SHE AS MY
COMPANION ROSE TO GREET HER BUT I HAVE HAD A VERY STRANGE
EXPERIENCE AND AS I HAVE NO PARENTS OR RELATIONS OF ANY SORT
FROM WHOM I COULD ASK ADVICE I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS YOU WOULD BE
KIND ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO
PRAY TAKE A SEAT MISS HUNTER
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO DO ANYTHING
THAT I CAN TO SERVE YOU
I COULD SEE THAT HOLMES WAS FAVOURABLY IMPRESSED BY THE MANNER
AND SPEECH OF HIS NEW CLIENT
HE LOOKED HER OVER IN HIS SEARCHING
FASHION AND THEN COMPOSED HIMSELF WITH HIS LIDS DROOPING AND
HIS FINGER TIPS TOGETHER TO LISTEN TO HER STORY
I HAVE BEEN A GOVERNESS FOR FIVE YEARS SAID SHE IN THE
FAMILY OF COLONEL SPENCE MUNRO BUT TWO MONTHS AGO THE COLONEL
RECEIVED AN APPOINTMENT AT HALIFAX IN NOVA SCOTIA AND TOOK HIS
CHILDREN OVER TO AMERICA WITH HIM SO THAT I FOUND MYSELF WITHOUT
A SITUATION
I ADVERTISED AND I ANSWERED ADVERTISEMENTS BUT
WITHOUT SUCCESS
AT LAST THE LITTLE MONEY WHICH I HAD SAVED BEGAN
TO RUN SHORT AND I WAS AT MY WIT'S END AS TO WHAT I SHOULD DO
THERE IS A WELL KNOWN AGENCY FOR GOVERNESSES IN THE WEST END
CALLED WESTAWAY'S AND THERE I USED TO CALL ABOUT ONCE A WEEK IN
ORDER TO SEE WHETHER ANYTHING HAD TURNED UP WHICH MIGHT SUIT ME
WESTAWAY WAS THE NAME OF THE FOUNDER OF THE BUSINESS BUT IT IS
REALLY MANAGED BY MISS STOPER
SHE SITS IN HER OWN LITTLE OFFICE
AND THE LADIES WHO ARE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT WAIT IN AN ANTEROOM
AND ARE THEN SHOWN IN ONE BY ONE WHEN SHE CONSULTS HER LEDGERS
AND SEES WHETHER SHE HAS ANYTHING WHICH WOULD SUIT THEM
WELL WHEN I CALLED LAST WEEK I WAS SHOWN INTO THE LITTLE OFFICE
AS USUAL BUT I FOUND THAT MISS STOPER WAS NOT ALONE
A
PRODIGIOUSLY STOUT MAN WITH A VERY SMILING FACE AND A GREAT HEAVY
CHIN WHICH ROLLED DOWN IN FOLD UPON FOLD OVER HIS THROAT SAT AT
HER ELBOW WITH A PAIR OF GLASSES ON HIS NOSE LOOKING VERY
EARNESTLY AT THE LADIES WHO ENTERED
AS I CAME IN HE GAVE QUITE A
JUMP IN HIS CHAIR AND TURNED QUICKLY TO MISS STOPER
'THAT WILL DO SAID HE 'I COULD NOT ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER
CAPITAL CAPITAL HE SEEMED QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC AND RUBBED HIS
HANDS TOGETHER IN THE MOST GENIAL FASHION
HE WAS SUCH A
COMFORTABLE LOOKING MAN THAT IT WAS QUITE A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT
HIM
'YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SITUATION MISS HE ASKED
'YES SIR
'AS GOVERNESS
'YES SIR
'AND WHAT SALARY DO YOU ASK
'I HAD 4 POUNDS A MONTH IN MY LAST PLACE WITH COLONEL SPENCE
MUNRO
'OH TUT TUT SWEATING RANK SWEATING HE CRIED THROWING HIS
FAT HANDS OUT INTO THE AIR LIKE A MAN WHO IS IN A BOILING
PASSION
'HOW COULD ANYONE OFFER SO PITIFUL A SUM TO A LADY WITH
SUCH ATTRACTIONS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
'MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS SIR MAY BE LESS THAN YOU IMAGINE SAID I
'A LITTLE FRENCH A LITTLE GERMAN MUSIC AND DRAWING
'TUT TUT HE CRIED
'THIS IS ALL QUITE BESIDE THE QUESTION
THE POINT IS HAVE YOU OR HAVE YOU NOT THE BEARING AND DEPORTMENT
OF A LADY THERE IT IS IN A NUTSHELL
IF YOU HAVE NOT YOU ARE
NOT FITTED FOR THE REARING OF A CHILD WHO MAY SOME DAY PLAY A
CONSIDERABLE PART IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY
BUT IF YOU HAVE
WHY THEN HOW COULD ANY GENTLEMAN ASK YOU TO CONDESCEND TO
ACCEPT ANYTHING UNDER THE THREE FIGURES YOUR SALARY WITH ME
MADAM WOULD COMMENCE AT 100 POUNDS A YEAR
YOU MAY IMAGINE MR
HOLMES THAT TO ME DESTITUTE AS I WAS
SUCH AN OFFER SEEMED ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
THE GENTLEMAN
HOWEVER SEEING PERHAPS THE LOOK OF INCREDULITY UPON MY FACE
OPENED A POCKET BOOK AND TOOK OUT A NOTE
'IT IS ALSO MY CUSTOM SAID HE SMILING IN THE MOST PLEASANT
FASHION UNTIL HIS EYES WERE JUST TWO LITTLE SHINING SLITS AMID
THE WHITE CREASES OF HIS FACE 'TO ADVANCE TO MY YOUNG LADIES
HALF THEIR SALARY BEFOREHAND SO THAT THEY MAY MEET ANY LITTLE
EXPENSES OF THEIR JOURNEY AND THEIR WARDROBE
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NEVER MET SO FASCINATING AND SO
THOUGHTFUL A MAN
AS I WAS ALREADY IN DEBT TO MY TRADESMEN THE
ADVANCE WAS A GREAT CONVENIENCE AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING
UNNATURAL ABOUT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION WHICH MADE ME WISH TO KNOW
A LITTLE MORE BEFORE I QUITE COMMITTED MYSELF
'MAY I ASK WHERE YOU LIVE SIR SAID I
'HAMPSHIRE
CHARMING RURAL PLACE
THE COPPER BEECHES FIVE MILES
ON THE FAR SIDE OF WINCHESTER
IT IS THE MOST LOVELY COUNTRY MY
DEAR YOUNG LADY AND THE DEAREST OLD COUNTRY HOUSE
'AND MY DUTIES SIR I SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD
BE
'ONE CHILD ONE DEAR LITTLE ROMPER JUST SIX YEARS OLD
OH IF
YOU COULD SEE HIM KILLING COCKROACHES WITH A SLIPPER SMACK
SMACK SMACK THREE GONE BEFORE YOU COULD WINK HE LEANED BACK
IN HIS CHAIR AND LAUGHED HIS EYES INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN
I WAS A LITTLE STARTLED AT THE NATURE OF THE CHILD'S AMUSEMENT
BUT THE FATHER'S LAUGHTER MADE ME THINK THAT PERHAPS HE WAS
JOKING
'MY SOLE DUTIES THEN I ASKED 'ARE TO TAKE CHARGE OF A SINGLE
CHILD
'NO NO NOT THE SOLE NOT THE SOLE MY DEAR YOUNG LADY HE
CRIED
'YOUR DUTY WOULD BE AS I AM SURE YOUR GOOD SENSE WOULD
SUGGEST TO OBEY ANY LITTLE COMMANDS MY WIFE MIGHT GIVE PROVIDED
ALWAYS THAT THEY WERE SUCH COMMANDS AS A LADY MIGHT WITH
PROPRIETY OBEY
YOU SEE NO DIFFICULTY HEH
'I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL
'QUITE SO
IN DRESS NOW FOR EXAMPLE
WE ARE FADDY PEOPLE YOU
KNOW FADDY BUT KIND HEARTED
IF YOU WERE ASKED TO WEAR ANY DRESS
WHICH WE MIGHT GIVE YOU YOU WOULD NOT OBJECT TO OUR LITTLE WHIM
HEH
'NO SAID I CONSIDERABLY ASTONISHED AT HIS WORDS
'OR TO SIT HERE OR SIT THERE THAT WOULD NOT BE OFFENSIVE TO
YOU
'OH NO
'OR TO CUT YOUR HAIR QUITE SHORT BEFORE YOU COME TO US
I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY EARS
AS YOU MAY OBSERVE MR
HOLMES
MY HAIR IS SOMEWHAT LUXURIANT AND OF A RATHER PECULIAR TINT OF
CHESTNUT
IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ARTISTIC
I COULD NOT DREAM OF
SACRIFICING IT IN THIS OFFHAND FASHION
'I AM AFRAID THAT THAT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE SAID I
HE HAD BEEN
WATCHING ME EAGERLY OUT OF HIS SMALL EYES AND I COULD SEE A
SHADOW PASS OVER HIS FACE AS I SPOKE
'I AM AFRAID THAT IT IS QUITE ESSENTIAL SAID HE
'IT IS A
LITTLE FANCY OF MY WIFE'S AND LADIES' FANCIES YOU KNOW MADAM
LADIES' FANCIES MUST BE CONSULTED
AND SO YOU WON'T CUT YOUR
HAIR
'NO SIR I REALLY COULD NOT I ANSWERED FIRMLY
'AH VERY WELL THEN THAT QUITE SETTLES THE MATTER
IT IS A
PITY BECAUSE IN OTHER RESPECTS YOU WOULD REALLY HAVE DONE VERY
NICELY
IN THAT CASE MISS STOPER I HAD BEST INSPECT A FEW MORE
OF YOUR YOUNG LADIES
THE MANAGERESS HAD SAT ALL THIS WHILE BUSY WITH HER PAPERS
WITHOUT A WORD TO EITHER OF US BUT SHE GLANCED AT ME NOW WITH SO
MUCH ANNOYANCE UPON HER FACE THAT I COULD NOT HELP SUSPECTING
THAT SHE HAD LOST A HANDSOME COMMISSION THROUGH MY REFUSAL
'DO YOU DESIRE YOUR NAME TO BE KEPT UPON THE BOOKS SHE ASKED
'IF YOU PLEASE MISS STOPER
'WELL REALLY IT SEEMS RATHER USELESS SINCE YOU REFUSE THE
MOST EXCELLENT OFFERS IN THIS FASHION SAID SHE SHARPLY
'YOU
CAN HARDLY EXPECT US TO EXERT OURSELVES TO FIND ANOTHER SUCH
OPENING FOR YOU
GOOD DAY TO YOU MISS HUNTER SHE STRUCK A GONG
UPON THE TABLE AND I WAS SHOWN OUT BY THE PAGE
WELL MR
HOLMES WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY LODGINGS AND FOUND
LITTLE ENOUGH IN THE CUPBOARD AND TWO OR THREE BILLS UPON THE
TABLE I BEGAN TO ASK MYSELF WHETHER I HAD NOT DONE A VERY
FOOLISH THING
AFTER ALL IF THESE PEOPLE HAD STRANGE FADS AND
EXPECTED OBEDIENCE ON THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MATTERS THEY WERE
AT LEAST READY TO PAY FOR THEIR ECCENTRICITY
VERY FEW
GOVERNESSES IN ENGLAND ARE GETTING 100 POUNDS A YEAR
BESIDES
WHAT USE WAS MY HAIR TO ME MANY PEOPLE ARE IMPROVED BY WEARING
IT SHORT AND PERHAPS I SHOULD BE AMONG THE NUMBER
NEXT DAY I WAS
INCLINED TO THINK THAT I HAD MADE A MISTAKE AND BY THE DAY AFTER
I WAS SURE OF IT
I HAD ALMOST OVERCOME MY PRIDE SO FAR AS TO GO
BACK TO THE AGENCY AND INQUIRE WHETHER THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
WHEN I RECEIVED THIS LETTER FROM THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF
I HAVE IT
HERE AND I WILL READ IT TO YOU
'THE COPPER BEECHES NEAR WINCHESTER
'DEAR MISS HUNTER MISS STOPER HAS VERY KINDLY GIVEN ME YOUR
ADDRESS AND I WRITE FROM HERE TO ASK YOU WHETHER YOU HAVE
RECONSIDERED YOUR DECISION
MY WIFE IS VERY ANXIOUS THAT YOU
SHOULD COME FOR SHE HAS BEEN MUCH ATTRACTED BY MY DESCRIPTION OF
YOU
WE ARE WILLING TO GIVE 30 POUNDS A QUARTER OR 120 POUNDS A
YEAR SO AS TO RECOMPENSE YOU FOR ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE WHICH
OUR FADS MAY CAUSE YOU
THEY ARE NOT VERY EXACTING AFTER ALL
MY
WIFE IS FOND OF A PARTICULAR SHADE OF ELECTRIC BLUE AND WOULD
LIKE YOU TO WEAR SUCH A DRESS INDOORS IN THE MORNING
YOU NEED
NOT HOWEVER GO TO THE EXPENSE OF PURCHASING ONE AS WE HAVE ONE
BELONGING TO MY DEAR DAUGHTER ALICE NOW IN PHILADELPHIA WHICH
WOULD I SHOULD THINK FIT YOU VERY WELL
THEN AS TO SITTING
HERE OR THERE OR AMUSING YOURSELF IN ANY MANNER INDICATED THAT
NEED CAUSE YOU NO INCONVENIENCE
AS REGARDS YOUR HAIR IT IS NO
DOUBT A PITY ESPECIALLY AS I COULD NOT HELP REMARKING ITS BEAUTY
DURING OUR SHORT INTERVIEW BUT I AM AFRAID THAT I MUST REMAIN
FIRM UPON THIS POINT AND I ONLY HOPE THAT THE INCREASED SALARY
MAY RECOMPENSE YOU FOR THE LOSS
YOUR DUTIES AS FAR AS THE CHILD
IS CONCERNED ARE VERY LIGHT
NOW DO TRY TO COME AND I SHALL
MEET YOU WITH THE DOG CART AT WINCHESTER
LET ME KNOW YOUR TRAIN
YOURS FAITHFULLY JEPHRO RUCASTLE
THAT IS THE LETTER WHICH I HAVE JUST RECEIVED MR
HOLMES AND
MY MIND IS MADE UP THAT I WILL ACCEPT IT
I THOUGHT HOWEVER
THAT BEFORE TAKING THE FINAL STEP I SHOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT THE
WHOLE MATTER TO YOUR CONSIDERATION
WELL MISS HUNTER IF YOUR MIND IS MADE UP THAT SETTLES THE
QUESTION SAID HOLMES SMILING
BUT YOU WOULD NOT ADVISE ME TO REFUSE
I CONFESS THAT IT IS NOT THE SITUATION WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO
SEE A SISTER OF MINE APPLY FOR
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF IT ALL MR
HOLMES
AH I HAVE NO DATA
I CANNOT TELL
PERHAPS YOU HAVE YOURSELF
FORMED SOME OPINION
WELL THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE ONLY ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION
MR
RUCASTLE SEEMED TO BE A VERY KIND GOOD NATURED MAN
IS IT NOT
POSSIBLE THAT HIS WIFE IS A LUNATIC THAT HE DESIRES TO KEEP THE
MATTER QUIET FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO AN ASYLUM AND THAT
HE HUMOURS HER FANCIES IN EVERY WAY IN ORDER TO PREVENT AN
OUTBREAK
THAT IS A POSSIBLE SOLUTION IN FACT AS MATTERS STAND IT IS
THE MOST PROBABLE ONE
BUT IN ANY CASE IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A
NICE HOUSEHOLD FOR A YOUNG LADY
BUT THE MONEY MR
HOLMES THE MONEY
WELL YES OF COURSE THE PAY IS GOOD TOO GOOD
THAT IS WHAT
MAKES ME UNEASY
WHY SHOULD THEY GIVE YOU 120 POUNDS A YEAR WHEN
THEY COULD HAVE THEIR PICK FOR 40 POUNDS THERE MUST BE SOME
STRONG REASON BEHIND
I THOUGHT THAT IF I TOLD YOU THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WOULD
UNDERSTAND AFTERWARDS IF I WANTED YOUR HELP
I SHOULD FEEL SO
MUCH STRONGER IF I FELT THAT YOU WERE AT THE BACK OF ME
OH YOU MAY CARRY THAT FEELING AWAY WITH YOU
I ASSURE YOU THAT
YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM PROMISES TO BE THE MOST INTERESTING WHICH HAS
COME MY WAY FOR SOME MONTHS
THERE IS SOMETHING DISTINCTLY NOVEL
ABOUT SOME OF THE FEATURES
IF YOU SHOULD FIND YOURSELF IN DOUBT
OR IN DANGER
DANGER WHAT DANGER DO YOU FORESEE
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY
IT WOULD CEASE TO BE A DANGER IF
WE COULD DEFINE IT SAID HE
BUT AT ANY TIME DAY OR NIGHT A
TELEGRAM WOULD BRING ME DOWN TO YOUR HELP
THAT IS ENOUGH SHE ROSE BRISKLY FROM HER CHAIR WITH THE
ANXIETY ALL SWEPT FROM HER FACE
I SHALL GO DOWN TO HAMPSHIRE
QUITE EASY IN MY MIND NOW
I SHALL WRITE TO MR
RUCASTLE AT ONCE
SACRIFICE MY POOR HAIR TO NIGHT AND START FOR WINCHESTER
TO MORROW WITH A FEW GRATEFUL WORDS TO HOLMES SHE BADE US BOTH
GOOD NIGHT AND BUSTLED OFF UPON HER WAY
AT LEAST SAID I AS WE HEARD HER QUICK FIRM STEPS DESCENDING
THE STAIRS SHE SEEMS TO BE A YOUNG LADY WHO IS VERY WELL ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
AND SHE WOULD NEED TO BE SAID HOLMES GRAVELY
I AM MUCH
MISTAKEN IF WE DO NOT HEAR FROM HER BEFORE MANY DAYS ARE PAST
IT WAS NOT VERY LONG BEFORE MY FRIEND'S PREDICTION WAS FULFILLED
A FORTNIGHT WENT BY DURING WHICH I FREQUENTLY FOUND MY THOUGHTS
TURNING IN HER DIRECTION AND WONDERING WHAT STRANGE SIDE ALLEY OF
HUMAN EXPERIENCE THIS LONELY WOMAN HAD STRAYED INTO
THE UNUSUAL
SALARY THE CURIOUS CONDITIONS THE LIGHT DUTIES ALL POINTED TO
SOMETHING ABNORMAL THOUGH WHETHER A FAD OR A PLOT OR WHETHER
THE MAN WERE A PHILANTHROPIST OR A VILLAIN IT WAS QUITE BEYOND
MY POWERS TO DETERMINE
AS TO HOLMES I OBSERVED THAT HE SAT
FREQUENTLY FOR HALF AN HOUR ON END WITH KNITTED BROWS AND AN
ABSTRACTED AIR BUT HE SWEPT THE MATTER AWAY WITH A WAVE OF HIS
HAND WHEN I MENTIONED IT
DATA DATA DATA HE CRIED
IMPATIENTLY
I CAN'T MAKE BRICKS WITHOUT CLAY AND YET HE WOULD
ALWAYS WIND UP BY MUTTERING THAT NO SISTER OF HIS SHOULD EVER
HAVE ACCEPTED SUCH A SITUATION
THE TELEGRAM WHICH WE EVENTUALLY RECEIVED CAME LATE ONE NIGHT
JUST AS I WAS THINKING OF TURNING IN AND HOLMES WAS SETTLING DOWN
TO ONE OF THOSE ALL NIGHT CHEMICAL RESEARCHES WHICH HE FREQUENTLY
INDULGED IN WHEN I WOULD LEAVE HIM STOOPING OVER A RETORT AND A
TEST TUBE AT NIGHT AND FIND HIM IN THE SAME POSITION WHEN I CAME
DOWN TO BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING
HE OPENED THE YELLOW ENVELOPE
AND THEN GLANCING AT THE MESSAGE THREW IT ACROSS TO ME
JUST LOOK UP THE TRAINS IN BRADSHAW SAID HE AND TURNED BACK
TO HIS CHEMICAL STUDIES
THE SUMMONS WAS A BRIEF AND URGENT ONE
PLEASE BE AT THE BLACK SWAN HOTEL AT WINCHESTER AT MIDDAY
TO MORROW IT SAID
DO COME I AM AT MY WIT'S END
HUNTER
WILL YOU COME WITH ME ASKED HOLMES GLANCING UP
I SHOULD WISH TO
JUST LOOK IT UP THEN
THERE IS A TRAIN AT HALF PAST NINE SAID I GLANCING OVER MY
BRADSHAW
IT IS DUE AT WINCHESTER AT 11 30
THAT WILL DO VERY NICELY
THEN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER POSTPONE MY
ANALYSIS OF THE ACETONES AS WE MAY NEED TO BE AT OUR BEST IN THE
MORNING
BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY WE WERE WELL UPON OUR WAY TO THE
OLD ENGLISH CAPITAL
HOLMES HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE MORNING PAPERS
ALL THE WAY DOWN BUT AFTER WE HAD PASSED THE HAMPSHIRE BORDER HE
THREW THEM DOWN AND BEGAN TO ADMIRE THE SCENERY
IT WAS AN IDEAL
SPRING DAY A LIGHT BLUE SKY FLECKED WITH LITTLE FLEECY WHITE
CLOUDS DRIFTING ACROSS FROM WEST TO EAST
THE SUN WAS SHINING
VERY BRIGHTLY AND YET THERE WAS AN EXHILARATING NIP IN THE AIR
WHICH SET AN EDGE TO A MAN'S ENERGY
ALL OVER THE COUNTRYSIDE
AWAY TO THE ROLLING HILLS AROUND ALDERSHOT THE LITTLE RED AND
GREY ROOFS OF THE FARM STEADINGS PEEPED OUT FROM AMID THE LIGHT
GREEN OF THE NEW FOLIAGE
ARE THEY NOT FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL I CRIED WITH ALL THE
ENTHUSIASM OF A MAN FRESH FROM THE FOGS OF BAKER STREET
BUT HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD GRAVELY
DO YOU KNOW WATSON SAID HE THAT IT IS ONE OF THE CURSES OF
A MIND WITH A TURN LIKE MINE THAT I MUST LOOK AT EVERYTHING WITH
REFERENCE TO MY OWN SPECIAL SUBJECT
YOU LOOK AT THESE SCATTERED
HOUSES AND YOU ARE IMPRESSED BY THEIR BEAUTY
I LOOK AT THEM
AND THE ONLY THOUGHT WHICH COMES TO ME IS A FEELING OF THEIR
ISOLATION AND OF THE IMPUNITY WITH WHICH CRIME MAY BE COMMITTED
THERE
GOOD HEAVENS I CRIED
WHO WOULD ASSOCIATE CRIME WITH THESE
DEAR OLD HOMESTEADS
THEY ALWAYS FILL ME WITH A CERTAIN HORROR
IT IS MY BELIEF
WATSON FOUNDED UPON MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE LOWEST AND VILEST
ALLEYS IN LONDON DO NOT PRESENT A MORE DREADFUL RECORD OF SIN
THAN DOES THE SMILING AND BEAUTIFUL COUNTRYSIDE
YOU HORRIFY ME
BUT THE REASON IS VERY OBVIOUS
THE PRESSURE OF PUBLIC OPINION
CAN DO IN THE TOWN WHAT THE LAW CANNOT ACCOMPLISH
THERE IS NO
LANE SO VILE THAT THE SCREAM OF A TORTURED CHILD OR THE THUD OF
A DRUNKARD'S BLOW DOES NOT BEGET SYMPATHY AND INDIGNATION AMONG
THE NEIGHBOURS AND THEN THE WHOLE MACHINERY OF JUSTICE IS EVER
SO CLOSE THAT A WORD OF COMPLAINT CAN SET IT GOING AND THERE IS
BUT A STEP BETWEEN THE CRIME AND THE DOCK
BUT LOOK AT THESE
LONELY HOUSES EACH IN ITS OWN FIELDS FILLED FOR THE MOST PART
WITH POOR IGNORANT FOLK WHO KNOW LITTLE OF THE LAW
THINK OF THE
DEEDS OF HELLISH CRUELTY THE HIDDEN WICKEDNESS WHICH MAY GO ON
YEAR IN YEAR OUT IN SUCH PLACES AND NONE THE WISER
HAD THIS
LADY WHO APPEALS TO US FOR HELP GONE TO LIVE IN WINCHESTER I
SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD A FEAR FOR HER
IT IS THE FIVE MILES OF
COUNTRY WHICH MAKES THE DANGER
STILL IT IS CLEAR THAT SHE IS
NOT PERSONALLY THREATENED
NO
IF SHE CAN COME TO WINCHESTER TO MEET US SHE CAN GET AWAY
QUITE SO
SHE HAS HER FREEDOM
WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER THEN CAN YOU SUGGEST NO EXPLANATION
I HAVE DEVISED SEVEN SEPARATE EXPLANATIONS EACH OF WHICH WOULD
COVER THE FACTS AS FAR AS WE KNOW THEM
BUT WHICH OF THESE IS
CORRECT CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED BY THE FRESH INFORMATION WHICH WE
SHALL NO DOUBT FIND WAITING FOR US
WELL THERE IS THE TOWER OF
THE CATHEDRAL AND WE SHALL SOON LEARN ALL THAT MISS HUNTER HAS
TO TELL
THE BLACK SWAN IS AN INN OF REPUTE IN THE HIGH STREET AT NO
DISTANCE FROM THE STATION AND THERE WE FOUND THE YOUNG LADY
WAITING FOR US
SHE HAD ENGAGED A SITTING ROOM AND OUR LUNCH
AWAITED US UPON THE TABLE
I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME SHE SAID EARNESTLY
IT
IS SO VERY KIND OF YOU BOTH BUT INDEED I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I
SHOULD DO
YOUR ADVICE WILL BE ALTOGETHER INVALUABLE TO ME
PRAY TELL US WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
I WILL DO SO AND I MUST BE QUICK FOR I HAVE PROMISED MR
RUCASTLE TO BE BACK BEFORE THREE
I GOT HIS LEAVE TO COME INTO
TOWN THIS MORNING THOUGH HE LITTLE KNEW FOR WHAT PURPOSE
LET US HAVE EVERYTHING IN ITS DUE ORDER HOLMES THRUST HIS LONG
THIN LEGS OUT TOWARDS THE FIRE AND COMPOSED HIMSELF TO LISTEN
IN THE FIRST PLACE I MAY SAY THAT I HAVE MET ON THE WHOLE
WITH NO ACTUAL ILL TREATMENT FROM MR
AND MRS
RUCASTLE
IT IS
ONLY FAIR TO THEM TO SAY THAT
BUT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THEM AND
I AM NOT EASY IN MY MIND ABOUT THEM
WHAT CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND
THEIR REASONS FOR THEIR CONDUCT
BUT YOU SHALL HAVE IT ALL JUST
AS IT OCCURRED
WHEN I CAME DOWN MR
RUCASTLE MET ME HERE AND
DROVE ME IN HIS DOG CART TO THE COPPER BEECHES
IT IS AS HE
SAID BEAUTIFULLY SITUATED BUT IT IS NOT BEAUTIFUL IN ITSELF
FOR IT IS A LARGE SQUARE BLOCK OF A HOUSE WHITEWASHED BUT ALL
STAINED AND STREAKED WITH DAMP AND BAD WEATHER
THERE ARE GROUNDS
ROUND IT WOODS ON THREE SIDES AND ON THE FOURTH A FIELD WHICH
SLOPES DOWN TO THE SOUTHAMPTON HIGHROAD WHICH CURVES PAST ABOUT
A HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE FRONT DOOR
THIS GROUND IN FRONT BELONGS
TO THE HOUSE BUT THE WOODS ALL ROUND ARE PART OF LORD
SOUTHERTON'S PRESERVES
A CLUMP OF COPPER BEECHES IMMEDIATELY IN
FRONT OF THE HALL DOOR HAS GIVEN ITS NAME TO THE PLACE
I WAS DRIVEN OVER BY MY EMPLOYER WHO WAS AS AMIABLE AS EVER
AND WAS INTRODUCED BY HIM THAT EVENING TO HIS WIFE AND THE CHILD
THERE WAS NO TRUTH MR
HOLMES IN THE CONJECTURE WHICH SEEMED TO
US TO BE PROBABLE IN YOUR ROOMS AT BAKER STREET
MRS
RUCASTLE IS
NOT MAD
I FOUND HER TO BE A SILENT PALE FACED WOMAN MUCH
YOUNGER THAN HER HUSBAND NOT MORE THAN THIRTY I SHOULD THINK
WHILE HE CAN HARDLY BE LESS THAN FORTY FIVE
FROM THEIR
CONVERSATION I HAVE GATHERED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED ABOUT
SEVEN YEARS THAT HE WAS A WIDOWER AND THAT HIS ONLY CHILD BY
THE FIRST WIFE WAS THE DAUGHTER WHO HAS GONE TO PHILADELPHIA
MR
RUCASTLE TOLD ME IN PRIVATE THAT THE REASON WHY SHE HAD LEFT THEM
WAS THAT SHE HAD AN UNREASONING AVERSION TO HER STEPMOTHER
AS
THE DAUGHTER COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LESS THAN TWENTY I CAN QUITE
IMAGINE THAT HER POSITION MUST HAVE BEEN UNCOMFORTABLE WITH HER
FATHER'S YOUNG WIFE
MRS
RUCASTLE SEEMED TO ME TO BE COLOURLESS IN MIND AS WELL AS
IN FEATURE
SHE IMPRESSED ME NEITHER FAVOURABLY NOR THE REVERSE
SHE WAS A NONENTITY
IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SHE WAS PASSIONATELY
DEVOTED BOTH TO HER HUSBAND AND TO HER LITTLE SON
HER LIGHT GREY
EYES WANDERED CONTINUALLY FROM ONE TO THE OTHER NOTING EVERY
LITTLE WANT AND FORESTALLING IT IF POSSIBLE
HE WAS KIND TO HER
ALSO IN HIS BLUFF BOISTEROUS FASHION AND ON THE WHOLE THEY
SEEMED TO BE A HAPPY COUPLE
AND YET SHE HAD SOME SECRET SORROW
THIS WOMAN
SHE WOULD OFTEN BE LOST IN DEEP THOUGHT WITH THE
SADDEST LOOK UPON HER FACE
MORE THAN ONCE I HAVE SURPRISED HER
IN TEARS
I HAVE THOUGHT SOMETIMES THAT IT WAS THE DISPOSITION OF
HER CHILD WHICH WEIGHED UPON HER MIND FOR I HAVE NEVER MET SO
UTTERLY SPOILED AND SO ILL NATURED A LITTLE CREATURE
HE IS SMALL
FOR HIS AGE WITH A HEAD WHICH IS QUITE DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGE
HIS WHOLE LIFE APPEARS TO BE SPENT IN AN ALTERNATION BETWEEN
SAVAGE FITS OF PASSION AND GLOOMY INTERVALS OF SULKING
GIVING
PAIN TO ANY CREATURE WEAKER THAN HIMSELF SEEMS TO BE HIS ONE IDEA
OF AMUSEMENT AND HE SHOWS QUITE REMARKABLE TALENT IN PLANNING
THE CAPTURE OF MICE LITTLE BIRDS AND INSECTS
BUT I WOULD
RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT THE CREATURE MR
HOLMES AND INDEED HE
HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH MY STORY
I AM GLAD OF ALL DETAILS REMARKED MY FRIEND WHETHER THEY
SEEM TO YOU TO BE RELEVANT OR NOT
I SHALL TRY NOT TO MISS ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE
THE ONE
UNPLEASANT THING ABOUT THE HOUSE WHICH STRUCK ME AT ONCE WAS
THE APPEARANCE AND CONDUCT OF THE SERVANTS
THERE ARE ONLY TWO A
MAN AND HIS WIFE
TOLLER FOR THAT IS HIS NAME IS A ROUGH
UNCOUTH MAN WITH GRIZZLED HAIR AND WHISKERS AND A PERPETUAL
SMELL OF DRINK
TWICE SINCE I HAVE BEEN WITH THEM HE HAS BEEN
QUITE DRUNK AND YET MR
RUCASTLE SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF IT
HIS WIFE IS A VERY TALL AND STRONG WOMAN WITH A SOUR FACE AS
SILENT AS MRS
RUCASTLE AND MUCH LESS AMIABLE
THEY ARE A MOST
UNPLEASANT COUPLE BUT FORTUNATELY I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME IN THE
NURSERY AND MY OWN ROOM WHICH ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN ONE
CORNER OF THE BUILDING
FOR TWO DAYS AFTER MY ARRIVAL AT THE COPPER BEECHES MY LIFE WAS
VERY QUIET ON THE THIRD MRS
RUCASTLE CAME DOWN JUST AFTER
BREAKFAST AND WHISPERED SOMETHING TO HER HUSBAND
'OH YES SAID HE TURNING TO ME 'WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO
YOU MISS HUNTER FOR FALLING IN WITH OUR WHIMS SO FAR AS TO CUT
YOUR HAIR
I ASSURE YOU THAT IT HAS NOT DETRACTED IN THE TINIEST
IOTA FROM YOUR APPEARANCE
WE SHALL NOW SEE HOW THE ELECTRIC BLUE
DRESS WILL BECOME YOU
YOU WILL FIND IT LAID OUT UPON THE BED IN
YOUR ROOM AND IF YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO PUT IT ON WE SHOULD
BOTH BE EXTREMELY OBLIGED
THE DRESS WHICH I FOUND WAITING FOR ME WAS OF A PECULIAR SHADE
OF BLUE
IT WAS OF EXCELLENT MATERIAL A SORT OF BEIGE BUT IT
BORE UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS OF HAVING BEEN WORN BEFORE
IT COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN A BETTER FIT IF I HAD BEEN MEASURED FOR IT
BOTH MR
AND MRS
RUCASTLE EXPRESSED A DELIGHT AT THE LOOK OF IT WHICH
SEEMED QUITE EXAGGERATED IN ITS VEHEMENCE
THEY WERE WAITING FOR
ME IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH IS A VERY LARGE ROOM STRETCHING
ALONG THE ENTIRE FRONT OF THE HOUSE WITH THREE LONG WINDOWS
REACHING DOWN TO THE FLOOR
A CHAIR HAD BEEN PLACED CLOSE TO THE
CENTRAL WINDOW WITH ITS BACK TURNED TOWARDS IT
IN THIS I WAS
ASKED TO SIT AND THEN MR
RUCASTLE WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM BEGAN TO TELL ME A SERIES OF THE FUNNIEST
STORIES THAT I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW
COMICAL HE WAS AND I LAUGHED UNTIL I WAS QUITE WEARY
MRS
RUCASTLE HOWEVER WHO HAS EVIDENTLY NO SENSE OF HUMOUR NEVER SO
MUCH AS SMILED BUT SAT WITH HER HANDS IN HER LAP AND A SAD
ANXIOUS LOOK UPON HER FACE
AFTER AN HOUR OR SO MR
RUCASTLE
SUDDENLY REMARKED THAT IT WAS TIME TO COMMENCE THE DUTIES OF THE
DAY AND THAT I MIGHT CHANGE MY DRESS AND GO TO LITTLE EDWARD IN
THE NURSERY
TWO DAYS LATER THIS SAME PERFORMANCE WAS GONE THROUGH UNDER
EXACTLY SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
AGAIN I CHANGED MY DRESS AGAIN I
SAT IN THE WINDOW AND AGAIN I LAUGHED VERY HEARTILY AT THE FUNNY
STORIES OF WHICH MY EMPLOYER HAD AN IMMENSE RPERTOIRE AND WHICH
HE TOLD INIMITABLY
THEN HE HANDED ME A YELLOW BACKED NOVEL AND
MOVING MY CHAIR A LITTLE SIDEWAYS THAT MY OWN SHADOW MIGHT NOT
FALL UPON THE PAGE HE BEGGED ME TO READ ALOUD TO HIM
I READ FOR
ABOUT TEN MINUTES BEGINNING IN THE HEART OF A CHAPTER AND THEN
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE HE ORDERED ME TO CEASE AND
TO CHANGE MY DRESS
YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE MR
HOLMES HOW CURIOUS I BECAME AS TO
WHAT THE MEANING OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE COULD POSSIBLY
BE
THEY WERE ALWAYS VERY CAREFUL I OBSERVED TO TURN MY FACE
AWAY FROM THE WINDOW SO THAT I BECAME CONSUMED WITH THE DESIRE
TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON BEHIND MY BACK
AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO BE
IMPOSSIBLE BUT I SOON DEVISED A MEANS
MY HAND MIRROR HAD BEEN
BROKEN SO A HAPPY THOUGHT SEIZED ME AND I CONCEALED A PIECE OF
THE GLASS IN MY HANDKERCHIEF
ON THE NEXT OCCASION IN THE MIDST
OF MY LAUGHTER I PUT MY HANDKERCHIEF UP TO MY EYES AND WAS ABLE
WITH A LITTLE MANAGEMENT TO SEE ALL THAT THERE WAS BEHIND ME
I
CONFESS THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED
THERE WAS NOTHING
AT LEAST THAT
WAS MY FIRST IMPRESSION
AT THE SECOND GLANCE HOWEVER I
PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS A MAN STANDING IN THE SOUTHAMPTON ROAD
A SMALL BEARDED MAN IN A GREY SUIT WHO SEEMED TO BE LOOKING IN
MY DIRECTION
THE ROAD IS AN IMPORTANT HIGHWAY AND THERE ARE
USUALLY PEOPLE THERE
THIS MAN HOWEVER WAS LEANING AGAINST THE
RAILINGS WHICH BORDERED OUR FIELD AND WAS LOOKING EARNESTLY UP
I
LOWERED MY HANDKERCHIEF AND GLANCED AT MRS
RUCASTLE TO FIND HER
EYES FIXED UPON ME WITH A MOST SEARCHING GAZE
SHE SAID NOTHING
BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT SHE HAD DIVINED THAT I HAD A MIRROR IN MY
HAND AND HAD SEEN WHAT WAS BEHIND ME
SHE ROSE AT ONCE
'JEPHRO SAID SHE 'THERE IS AN IMPERTINENT FELLOW UPON THE
ROAD THERE WHO STARES UP AT MISS HUNTER
'NO FRIEND OF YOURS MISS HUNTER HE ASKED
'NO I KNOW NO ONE IN THESE PARTS
'DEAR ME HOW VERY IMPERTINENT KINDLY TURN ROUND AND MOTION TO
HIM TO GO AWAY
'SURELY IT WOULD BE BETTER TO TAKE NO NOTICE
'NO NO WE SHOULD HAVE HIM LOITERING HERE ALWAYS
KINDLY TURN
ROUND AND WAVE HIM AWAY LIKE THAT
I DID AS I WAS TOLD AND AT THE SAME INSTANT MRS
RUCASTLE DREW
DOWN THE BLIND
THAT WAS A WEEK AGO AND FROM THAT TIME I HAVE
NOT SAT AGAIN IN THE WINDOW NOR HAVE I WORN THE BLUE DRESS NOR
SEEN THE MAN IN THE ROAD
PRAY CONTINUE SAID HOLMES
YOUR NARRATIVE PROMISES TO BE A
MOST INTERESTING ONE
YOU WILL FIND IT RATHER DISCONNECTED I FEAR AND THERE MAY
PROVE TO BE LITTLE RELATION BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT INCIDENTS OF
WHICH I SPEAK
ON THE VERY FIRST DAY THAT I WAS AT THE COPPER
BEECHES MR
RUCASTLE TOOK ME TO A SMALL OUTHOUSE WHICH STANDS
NEAR THE KITCHEN DOOR
AS WE APPROACHED IT I HEARD THE SHARP
RATTLING OF A CHAIN AND THE SOUND AS OF A LARGE ANIMAL MOVING
ABOUT
'LOOK IN HERE SAID MR
RUCASTLE SHOWING ME A SLIT BETWEEN TWO
PLANKS
'IS HE NOT A BEAUTY
I LOOKED THROUGH AND WAS CONSCIOUS OF TWO GLOWING EYES AND OF A
VAGUE FIGURE HUDDLED UP IN THE DARKNESS
'DON'T BE FRIGHTENED SAID MY EMPLOYER LAUGHING AT THE START
WHICH I HAD GIVEN
'IT'S ONLY CARLO MY MASTIFF
I CALL HIM MINE
BUT REALLY OLD TOLLER MY GROOM IS THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN DO
ANYTHING WITH HIM
WE FEED HIM ONCE A DAY AND NOT TOO MUCH THEN
SO THAT HE IS ALWAYS AS KEEN AS MUSTARD
TOLLER LETS HIM LOOSE
EVERY NIGHT AND GOD HELP THE TRESPASSER WHOM HE LAYS HIS FANGS
UPON
FOR GOODNESS' SAKE DON'T YOU EVER ON ANY PRETEXT SET YOUR
FOOT OVER THE THRESHOLD AT NIGHT FOR IT'S AS MUCH AS YOUR LIFE
IS WORTH
THE WARNING WAS NO IDLE ONE FOR TWO NIGHTS LATER I HAPPENED TO
LOOK OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT NIGHT AND THE LAWN IN FRONT OF THE
HOUSE WAS SILVERED OVER AND ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS DAY
I WAS
STANDING RAPT IN THE PEACEFUL BEAUTY OF THE SCENE WHEN I WAS
AWARE THAT SOMETHING WAS MOVING UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE COPPER
BEECHES
AS IT EMERGED INTO THE MOONSHINE I SAW WHAT IT WAS
IT
WAS A GIANT DOG AS LARGE AS A CALF TAWNY TINTED WITH HANGING
JOWL BLACK MUZZLE AND HUGE PROJECTING BONES
IT WALKED SLOWLY
ACROSS THE LAWN AND VANISHED INTO THE SHADOW UPON THE OTHER SIDE
THAT DREADFUL SENTINEL SENT A CHILL TO MY HEART WHICH I DO NOT
THINK THAT ANY BURGLAR COULD HAVE DONE
AND NOW I HAVE A VERY STRANGE EXPERIENCE TO TELL YOU
I HAD AS
YOU KNOW CUT OFF MY HAIR IN LONDON AND I HAD PLACED IT IN A
GREAT COIL AT THE BOTTOM OF MY TRUNK
ONE EVENING AFTER THE
CHILD WAS IN BED I BEGAN TO AMUSE MYSELF BY EXAMINING THE
FURNITURE OF MY ROOM AND BY REARRANGING MY OWN LITTLE THINGS
THERE WAS AN OLD CHEST OF DRAWERS IN THE ROOM THE TWO UPPER ONES
EMPTY AND OPEN THE LOWER ONE LOCKED
I HAD FILLED THE FIRST TWO
WITH MY LINEN AND AS I HAD STILL MUCH TO PACK AWAY I WAS
NATURALLY ANNOYED AT NOT HAVING THE USE OF THE THIRD DRAWER
IT
STRUCK ME THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FASTENED BY A MERE OVERSIGHT
SO I TOOK OUT MY BUNCH OF KEYS AND TRIED TO OPEN IT
THE VERY
FIRST KEY FITTED TO PERFECTION AND I DREW THE DRAWER OPEN
THERE
WAS ONLY ONE THING IN IT BUT I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER
GUESS WHAT IT WAS
IT WAS MY COIL OF HAIR
I TOOK IT UP AND EXAMINED IT
IT WAS OF THE SAME PECULIAR TINT
AND THE SAME THICKNESS
BUT THEN THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE THING
OBTRUDED ITSELF UPON ME
HOW COULD MY HAIR HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN
THE DRAWER WITH TREMBLING HANDS I UNDID MY TRUNK TURNED OUT THE
CONTENTS AND DREW FROM THE BOTTOM MY OWN HAIR
I LAID THE TWO
TRESSES TOGETHER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WERE IDENTICAL
WAS
IT NOT EXTRAORDINARY PUZZLE AS I WOULD I COULD MAKE NOTHING AT
ALL OF WHAT IT MEANT
I RETURNED THE STRANGE HAIR TO THE DRAWER
AND I SAID NOTHING OF THE MATTER TO THE RUCASTLES AS I FELT THAT
I HAD PUT MYSELF IN THE WRONG BY OPENING A DRAWER WHICH THEY HAD
LOCKED
I AM NATURALLY OBSERVANT AS YOU MAY HAVE REMARKED MR
HOLMES
AND I SOON HAD A PRETTY GOOD PLAN OF THE WHOLE HOUSE IN MY HEAD
THERE WAS ONE WING HOWEVER WHICH APPEARED NOT TO BE INHABITED
AT ALL
A DOOR WHICH FACED THAT WHICH LED INTO THE QUARTERS OF
THE TOLLERS OPENED INTO THIS SUITE BUT IT WAS INVARIABLY LOCKED
ONE DAY HOWEVER AS I ASCENDED THE STAIR I MET MR
RUCASTLE
COMING OUT THROUGH THIS DOOR HIS KEYS IN HIS HAND AND A LOOK ON
HIS FACE WHICH MADE HIM A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON TO THE ROUND
JOVIAL MAN TO WHOM I WAS ACCUSTOMED
HIS CHEEKS WERE RED HIS
BROW WAS ALL CRINKLED WITH ANGER AND THE VEINS STOOD OUT AT HIS
TEMPLES WITH PASSION
HE LOCKED THE DOOR AND HURRIED PAST ME
WITHOUT A WORD OR A LOOK
THIS AROUSED MY CURIOSITY SO WHEN I WENT OUT FOR A WALK IN THE
GROUNDS WITH MY CHARGE I STROLLED ROUND TO THE SIDE FROM WHICH I
COULD SEE THE WINDOWS OF THIS PART OF THE HOUSE
THERE WERE FOUR
OF THEM IN A ROW THREE OF WHICH WERE SIMPLY DIRTY WHILE THE
FOURTH WAS SHUTTERED UP
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY ALL DESERTED
AS I
STROLLED UP AND DOWN GLANCING AT THEM OCCASIONALLY MR
RUCASTLE
CAME OUT TO ME LOOKING AS MERRY AND JOVIAL AS EVER
'AH SAID HE 'YOU MUST NOT THINK ME RUDE IF I PASSED YOU
WITHOUT A WORD MY DEAR YOUNG LADY
I WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH
BUSINESS MATTERS
I ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOT OFFENDED
'BY THE WAY SAID I
'YOU SEEM TO HAVE QUITE A SUITE OF SPARE ROOMS UP THERE AND ONE
OF THEM HAS THE SHUTTERS UP
HE LOOKED SURPRISED AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME A LITTLE STARTLED
AT MY REMARK
'PHOTOGRAPHY IS ONE OF MY HOBBIES SAID HE
'I HAVE MADE MY
DARK ROOM UP THERE
BUT DEAR ME WHAT AN OBSERVANT YOUNG LADY WE
HAVE COME UPON
WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT WHO WOULD HAVE EVER
BELIEVED IT HE SPOKE IN A JESTING TONE BUT THERE WAS NO JEST
IN HIS EYES AS HE LOOKED AT ME
I READ SUSPICION THERE AND
ANNOYANCE BUT NO JEST
WELL MR
HOLMES FROM THE MOMENT THAT I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE
WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SUITE OF ROOMS WHICH I WAS NOT TO KNOW
I WAS ALL ON FIRE TO GO OVER THEM
IT WAS NOT MERE CURIOSITY
THOUGH I HAVE MY SHARE OF THAT
IT WAS MORE A FEELING OF DUTY A
FEELING THAT SOME GOOD MIGHT COME FROM MY PENETRATING TO THIS
PLACE
THEY TALK OF WOMAN'S INSTINCT PERHAPS IT WAS WOMAN'S
INSTINCT WHICH GAVE ME THAT FEELING
AT ANY RATE IT WAS THERE
AND I WAS KEENLY ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ANY CHANCE TO PASS THE
FORBIDDEN DOOR
IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY THAT THE CHANCE CAME
I MAY TELL YOU THAT
BESIDES MR
RUCASTLE BOTH TOLLER AND HIS WIFE FIND SOMETHING TO
DO IN THESE DESERTED ROOMS AND I ONCE SAW HIM CARRYING A LARGE
BLACK LINEN BAG WITH HIM THROUGH THE DOOR
RECENTLY HE HAS BEEN
DRINKING HARD AND YESTERDAY EVENING HE WAS VERY DRUNK AND WHEN
I CAME UPSTAIRS THERE WAS THE KEY IN THE DOOR
I HAVE NO DOUBT AT
ALL THAT HE HAD LEFT IT THERE
MR
AND MRS
RUCASTLE WERE BOTH
DOWNSTAIRS AND THE CHILD WAS WITH THEM SO THAT I HAD AN
ADMIRABLE OPPORTUNITY
I TURNED THE KEY GENTLY IN THE LOCK
OPENED THE DOOR AND SLIPPED THROUGH
THERE WAS A LITTLE PASSAGE IN FRONT OF ME UNPAPERED AND
UNCARPETED WHICH TURNED AT A RIGHT ANGLE AT THE FARTHER END
ROUND THIS CORNER WERE THREE DOORS IN A LINE THE FIRST AND THIRD
OF WHICH WERE OPEN
THEY EACH LED INTO AN EMPTY ROOM DUSTY AND
CHEERLESS WITH TWO WINDOWS IN THE ONE AND ONE IN THE OTHER SO
THICK WITH DIRT THAT THE EVENING LIGHT GLIMMERED DIMLY THROUGH
THEM
THE CENTRE DOOR WAS CLOSED AND ACROSS THE OUTSIDE OF IT
HAD BEEN FASTENED ONE OF THE BROAD BARS OF AN IRON BED PADLOCKED
AT ONE END TO A RING IN THE WALL AND FASTENED AT THE OTHER WITH
STOUT CORD
THE DOOR ITSELF WAS LOCKED AS WELL AND THE KEY WAS
NOT THERE
THIS BARRICADED DOOR CORRESPONDED CLEARLY WITH THE
SHUTTERED WINDOW OUTSIDE AND YET I COULD SEE BY THE GLIMMER FROM
BENEATH IT THAT THE ROOM WAS NOT IN DARKNESS
EVIDENTLY THERE WAS
A SKYLIGHT WHICH LET IN LIGHT FROM ABOVE
AS I STOOD IN THE
PASSAGE GAZING AT THE SINISTER DOOR AND WONDERING WHAT SECRET IT
MIGHT VEIL I SUDDENLY HEARD THE SOUND OF STEPS WITHIN THE ROOM
AND SAW A SHADOW PASS BACKWARD AND FORWARD AGAINST THE LITTLE
SLIT OF DIM LIGHT WHICH SHONE OUT FROM UNDER THE DOOR
A MAD
UNREASONING TERROR ROSE UP IN ME AT THE SIGHT MR
HOLMES
MY
OVERSTRUNG NERVES FAILED ME SUDDENLY AND I TURNED AND RAN RAN
AS THOUGH SOME DREADFUL HAND WERE BEHIND ME CLUTCHING AT THE
SKIRT OF MY DRESS
I RUSHED DOWN THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE DOOR
AND STRAIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF MR
RUCASTLE WHO WAS WAITING
OUTSIDE
'SO SAID HE SMILING 'IT WAS YOU THEN
I THOUGHT THAT IT
MUST BE WHEN I SAW THE DOOR OPEN
'OH I AM SO FRIGHTENED I PANTED
'MY DEAR YOUNG LADY MY DEAR YOUNG LADY YOU CANNOT THINK HOW
CARESSING AND SOOTHING HIS MANNER WAS 'AND WHAT HAS FRIGHTENED
YOU MY DEAR YOUNG LADY
BUT HIS VOICE WAS JUST A LITTLE TOO COAXING
HE OVERDID IT
I
WAS KEENLY ON MY GUARD AGAINST HIM
'I WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH TO GO INTO THE EMPTY WING I ANSWERED
'BUT IT IS SO LONELY AND EERIE IN THIS DIM LIGHT THAT I WAS
FRIGHTENED AND RAN OUT AGAIN
OH IT IS SO DREADFULLY STILL IN
THERE
'ONLY THAT SAID HE LOOKING AT ME KEENLY
'WHY WHAT DID YOU THINK I ASKED
'WHY DO YOU THINK THAT I LOCK THIS DOOR
'I AM SURE THAT I DO NOT KNOW
'IT IS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT WHO HAVE NO BUSINESS THERE
DO YOU
SEE HE WAS STILL SMILING IN THE MOST AMIABLE MANNER
'I AM SURE IF I HAD KNOWN
'WELL THEN YOU KNOW NOW
AND IF YOU EVER PUT YOUR FOOT OVER
THAT THRESHOLD AGAIN' HERE IN AN INSTANT THE SMILE HARDENED INTO
A GRIN OF RAGE AND HE GLARED DOWN AT ME WITH THE FACE OF A
DEMON 'I'LL THROW YOU TO THE MASTIFF
I WAS SO TERRIFIED THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I DID
I SUPPOSE THAT
I MUST HAVE RUSHED PAST HIM INTO MY ROOM
I REMEMBER NOTHING
UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF LYING ON MY BED TREMBLING ALL OVER
THEN I
THOUGHT OF YOU MR
HOLMES
I COULD NOT LIVE THERE LONGER WITHOUT
SOME ADVICE
I WAS FRIGHTENED OF THE HOUSE OF THE MAN OF THE
WOMAN OF THE SERVANTS EVEN OF THE CHILD
THEY WERE ALL HORRIBLE
TO ME
IF I COULD ONLY BRING YOU DOWN ALL WOULD BE WELL
OF
COURSE I MIGHT HAVE FLED FROM THE HOUSE BUT MY CURIOSITY WAS
ALMOST AS STRONG AS MY FEARS
MY MIND WAS SOON MADE UP
I WOULD
SEND YOU A WIRE
I PUT ON MY HAT AND CLOAK WENT DOWN TO THE
OFFICE WHICH IS ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE HOUSE AND THEN
RETURNED FEELING VERY MUCH EASIER
A HORRIBLE DOUBT CAME INTO MY
MIND AS I APPROACHED THE DOOR LEST THE DOG MIGHT BE LOOSE BUT I
REMEMBERED THAT TOLLER HAD DRUNK HIMSELF INTO A STATE OF
INSENSIBILITY THAT EVENING AND I KNEW THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
IN THE HOUSEHOLD WHO HAD ANY INFLUENCE WITH THE SAVAGE CREATURE
OR WHO WOULD VENTURE TO SET HIM FREE
I SLIPPED IN IN SAFETY AND
LAY AWAKE HALF THE NIGHT IN MY JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF SEEING YOU
I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING LEAVE TO COME INTO WINCHESTER THIS
MORNING BUT I MUST BE BACK BEFORE THREE O'CLOCK FOR MR
AND
MRS
RUCASTLE ARE GOING ON A VISIT AND WILL BE AWAY ALL THE
EVENING SO THAT I MUST LOOK AFTER THE CHILD
NOW I HAVE TOLD YOU
ALL MY ADVENTURES MR
HOLMES AND I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD IF YOU
COULD TELL ME WHAT IT ALL MEANS AND ABOVE ALL WHAT I SHOULD
DO
HOLMES AND I HAD LISTENED SPELLBOUND TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY STORY
MY FRIEND ROSE NOW AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM HIS HANDS IN
HIS POCKETS AND AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST PROFOUND GRAVITY UPON
HIS FACE
IS TOLLER STILL DRUNK HE ASKED
YES
I HEARD HIS WIFE TELL MRS
RUCASTLE THAT SHE COULD DO
NOTHING WITH HIM
THAT IS WELL
AND THE RUCASTLES GO OUT TO NIGHT
YES
IS THERE A CELLAR WITH A GOOD STRONG LOCK
YES THE WINE CELLAR
YOU SEEM TO ME TO HAVE ACTED ALL THROUGH THIS MATTER LIKE A VERY
BRAVE AND SENSIBLE GIRL MISS HUNTER
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD
PERFORM ONE MORE FEAT I SHOULD NOT ASK IT OF YOU IF I DID NOT
THINK YOU A QUITE EXCEPTIONAL WOMAN
I WILL TRY
WHAT IS IT
WE SHALL BE AT THE COPPER BEECHES BY SEVEN O'CLOCK MY FRIEND
AND I
THE RUCASTLES WILL BE GONE BY THAT TIME AND TOLLER WILL
WE HOPE BE INCAPABLE
THERE ONLY REMAINS MRS
TOLLER WHO MIGHT
GIVE THE ALARM
IF YOU COULD SEND HER INTO THE CELLAR ON SOME
ERRAND AND THEN TURN THE KEY UPON HER YOU WOULD FACILITATE
MATTERS IMMENSELY
I WILL DO IT
EXCELLENT WE SHALL THEN LOOK THOROUGHLY INTO THE AFFAIR
OF
COURSE THERE IS ONLY ONE FEASIBLE EXPLANATION
YOU HAVE BEEN
BROUGHT THERE TO PERSONATE SOMEONE AND THE REAL PERSON IS
IMPRISONED IN THIS CHAMBER
THAT IS OBVIOUS
AS TO WHO THIS
PRISONER IS I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT IS THE DAUGHTER MISS ALICE
RUCASTLE IF I REMEMBER RIGHT WHO WAS SAID TO HAVE GONE TO
AMERICA
YOU WERE CHOSEN DOUBTLESS AS RESEMBLING HER IN HEIGHT
FIGURE AND THE COLOUR OF YOUR HAIR
HERS HAD BEEN CUT OFF VERY
POSSIBLY IN SOME ILLNESS THROUGH WHICH SHE HAS PASSED AND SO OF
COURSE YOURS HAD TO BE SACRIFICED ALSO
BY A CURIOUS CHANCE YOU
CAME UPON HER TRESSES
THE MAN IN THE ROAD WAS UNDOUBTEDLY SOME
FRIEND OF HERS POSSIBLY HER FIANC AND NO DOUBT AS YOU WORE
THE GIRL'S DRESS AND WERE SO LIKE HER HE WAS CONVINCED FROM YOUR
LAUGHTER WHENEVER HE SAW YOU AND AFTERWARDS FROM YOUR GESTURE
THAT MISS RUCASTLE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND THAT SHE NO LONGER
DESIRED HIS ATTENTIONS
THE DOG IS LET LOOSE AT NIGHT TO PREVENT
HIM FROM ENDEAVOURING TO COMMUNICATE WITH HER
SO MUCH IS FAIRLY
CLEAR
THE MOST SERIOUS POINT IN THE CASE IS THE DISPOSITION OF
THE CHILD
WHAT ON EARTH HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT I EJACULATED
MY DEAR WATSON YOU AS A MEDICAL MAN ARE CONTINUALLY GAINING
LIGHT AS TO THE TENDENCIES OF A CHILD BY THE STUDY OF THE
PARENTS
DON'T YOU SEE THAT THE CONVERSE IS EQUALLY VALID
I HAVE
FREQUENTLY GAINED MY FIRST REAL INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF
PARENTS BY STUDYING THEIR CHILDREN
THIS CHILD'S DISPOSITION IS
ABNORMALLY CRUEL MERELY FOR CRUELTY'S SAKE AND WHETHER HE
DERIVES THIS FROM HIS SMILING FATHER AS I SHOULD SUSPECT OR
FROM HIS MOTHER IT BODES EVIL FOR THE POOR GIRL WHO IS IN THEIR
POWER
I AM SURE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT MR
HOLMES CRIED OUR CLIENT
A
THOUSAND THINGS COME BACK TO ME WHICH MAKE ME CERTAIN THAT YOU
HAVE HIT IT
OH LET US LOSE NOT AN INSTANT IN BRINGING HELP TO
THIS POOR CREATURE
WE MUST BE CIRCUMSPECT FOR WE ARE DEALING WITH A VERY CUNNING
MAN
WE CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL SEVEN O'CLOCK
AT THAT HOUR WE SHALL
BE WITH YOU AND IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE WE SOLVE THE
MYSTERY
WE WERE AS GOOD AS OUR WORD FOR IT WAS JUST SEVEN WHEN WE
REACHED THE COPPER BEECHES HAVING PUT UP OUR TRAP AT A WAYSIDE
PUBLIC HOUSE
THE GROUP OF TREES WITH THEIR DARK LEAVES SHINING
LIKE BURNISHED METAL IN THE LIGHT OF THE SETTING SUN WERE
SUFFICIENT TO MARK THE HOUSE EVEN HAD MISS HUNTER NOT BEEN
STANDING SMILING ON THE DOOR STEP
HAVE YOU MANAGED IT ASKED HOLMES
A LOUD THUDDING NOISE CAME FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS
THAT IS
MRS
TOLLER IN THE CELLAR SAID SHE
HER HUSBAND LIES SNORING
ON THE KITCHEN RUG
HERE ARE HIS KEYS WHICH ARE THE DUPLICATES
OF MR
RUCASTLE'S
YOU HAVE DONE WELL INDEED CRIED HOLMES WITH ENTHUSIASM
NOW
LEAD THE WAY AND WE SHALL SOON SEE THE END OF THIS BLACK
BUSINESS
WE PASSED UP THE STAIR UNLOCKED THE DOOR FOLLOWED ON DOWN A
PASSAGE AND FOUND OURSELVES IN FRONT OF THE BARRICADE WHICH MISS
HUNTER HAD DESCRIBED
HOLMES CUT THE CORD AND REMOVED THE
TRANSVERSE BAR
THEN HE TRIED THE VARIOUS KEYS IN THE LOCK BUT
WITHOUT SUCCESS
NO SOUND CAME FROM WITHIN AND AT THE SILENCE
HOLMES' FACE CLOUDED OVER
I TRUST THAT WE ARE NOT TOO LATE SAID HE
I THINK MISS
HUNTER THAT WE HAD BETTER GO IN WITHOUT YOU
NOW WATSON PUT
YOUR SHOULDER TO IT AND WE SHALL SEE WHETHER WE CANNOT MAKE OUR
WAY IN
IT WAS AN OLD RICKETY DOOR AND GAVE AT ONCE BEFORE OUR UNITED
STRENGTH
TOGETHER WE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM
IT WAS EMPTY
THERE
WAS NO FURNITURE SAVE A LITTLE PALLET BED A SMALL TABLE AND A
BASKETFUL OF LINEN
THE SKYLIGHT ABOVE WAS OPEN AND THE PRISONER
GONE
THERE HAS BEEN SOME VILLAINY HERE SAID HOLMES THIS BEAUTY
HAS GUESSED MISS HUNTER'S INTENTIONS AND HAS CARRIED HIS VICTIM
OFF
BUT HOW
THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT
WE SHALL SOON SEE HOW HE MANAGED IT HE
SWUNG HIMSELF UP ONTO THE ROOF
AH YES HE CRIED HERE'S THE
END OF A LONG LIGHT LADDER AGAINST THE EAVES
THAT IS HOW HE DID
IT
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE SAID MISS HUNTER THE LADDER WAS NOT
THERE WHEN THE RUCASTLES WENT AWAY
HE HAS COME BACK AND DONE IT
I TELL YOU THAT HE IS A CLEVER AND
DANGEROUS MAN
I SHOULD NOT BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED IF THIS WERE
HE WHOSE STEP I HEAR NOW UPON THE STAIR
I THINK WATSON THAT IT
WOULD BE AS WELL FOR YOU TO HAVE YOUR PISTOL READY
THE WORDS WERE HARDLY OUT OF HIS MOUTH BEFORE A MAN APPEARED AT
THE DOOR OF THE ROOM A VERY FAT AND BURLY MAN WITH A HEAVY
STICK IN HIS HAND
MISS HUNTER SCREAMED AND SHRUNK AGAINST THE
WALL AT THE SIGHT OF HIM BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES SPRANG FORWARD AND
CONFRONTED HIM
YOU VILLAIN SAID HE WHERE'S YOUR DAUGHTER
THE FAT MAN CAST HIS EYES ROUND AND THEN UP AT THE OPEN
SKYLIGHT
IT IS FOR ME TO ASK YOU THAT HE SHRIEKED YOU THIEVES SPIES
AND THIEVES I HAVE CAUGHT YOU HAVE I YOU ARE IN MY POWER
I'LL
SERVE YOU HE TURNED AND CLATTERED DOWN THE STAIRS AS HARD AS HE
COULD GO
HE'S GONE FOR THE DOG CRIED MISS HUNTER
I HAVE MY REVOLVER SAID I
BETTER CLOSE THE FRONT DOOR CRIED HOLMES AND WE ALL RUSHED
DOWN THE STAIRS TOGETHER
WE HAD HARDLY REACHED THE HALL WHEN WE
HEARD THE BAYING OF A HOUND AND THEN A SCREAM OF AGONY WITH A
HORRIBLE WORRYING SOUND WHICH IT WAS DREADFUL TO LISTEN TO
AN
ELDERLY MAN WITH A RED FACE AND SHAKING LIMBS CAME STAGGERING OUT
AT A SIDE DOOR
MY GOD HE CRIED
SOMEONE HAS LOOSED THE DOG
IT'S NOT BEEN
FED FOR TWO DAYS
QUICK QUICK OR IT'LL BE TOO LATE
HOLMES AND I RUSHED OUT AND ROUND THE ANGLE OF THE HOUSE WITH
TOLLER HURRYING BEHIND US
THERE WAS THE HUGE FAMISHED BRUTE ITS
BLACK MUZZLE BURIED IN RUCASTLE'S THROAT WHILE HE WRITHED AND
SCREAMED UPON THE GROUND
RUNNING UP I BLEW ITS BRAINS OUT AND
IT FELL OVER WITH ITS KEEN WHITE TEETH STILL MEETING IN THE GREAT
CREASES OF HIS NECK
WITH MUCH LABOUR WE SEPARATED THEM AND
CARRIED HIM LIVING BUT HORRIBLY MANGLED INTO THE HOUSE
WE LAID
HIM UPON THE DRAWING ROOM SOFA AND HAVING DISPATCHED THE SOBERED
TOLLER TO BEAR THE NEWS TO HIS WIFE I DID WHAT I COULD TO
RELIEVE HIS PAIN
WE WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ROUND HIM WHEN THE DOOR
OPENED AND A TALL GAUNT WOMAN ENTERED THE ROOM
MRS
TOLLER CRIED MISS HUNTER
YES MISS
MR
RUCASTLE LET ME OUT WHEN HE CAME BACK BEFORE HE
WENT UP TO YOU
AH MISS IT IS A PITY YOU DIDN'T LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE PLANNING FOR I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT YOUR PAINS
WERE WASTED
HA SAID HOLMES LOOKING KEENLY AT HER
IT IS CLEAR THAT MRS
TOLLER KNOWS MORE ABOUT THIS MATTER THAN ANYONE ELSE
YES SIR I DO AND I AM READY ENOUGH TO TELL WHAT I KNOW
THEN PRAY SIT DOWN AND LET US HEAR IT FOR THERE ARE SEVERAL
POINTS ON WHICH I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM STILL IN THE DARK
I WILL SOON MAKE IT CLEAR TO YOU SAID SHE AND I'D HAVE DONE
SO BEFORE NOW IF I COULD HA' GOT OUT FROM THE CELLAR
IF THERE'S
POLICE COURT BUSINESS OVER THIS YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT I WAS THE
ONE THAT STOOD YOUR FRIEND AND THAT I WAS MISS ALICE'S FRIEND
TOO
SHE WAS NEVER HAPPY AT HOME MISS ALICE WASN'T FROM THE TIME
THAT HER FATHER MARRIED AGAIN
SHE WAS SLIGHTED LIKE AND HAD NO
SAY IN ANYTHING BUT IT NEVER REALLY BECAME BAD FOR HER UNTIL
AFTER SHE MET MR
FOWLER AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE
AS WELL AS I COULD
LEARN MISS ALICE HAD RIGHTS OF HER OWN BY WILL BUT SHE WAS SO
QUIET AND PATIENT SHE WAS THAT SHE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT THEM
BUT JUST LEFT EVERYTHING IN MR
RUCASTLE'S HANDS
HE KNEW HE WAS
SAFE WITH HER BUT WHEN THERE WAS A CHANCE OF A HUSBAND COMING
FORWARD WHO WOULD ASK FOR ALL THAT THE LAW WOULD GIVE HIM THEN
HER FATHER THOUGHT IT TIME TO PUT A STOP ON IT
HE WANTED HER TO
SIGN A PAPER SO THAT WHETHER SHE MARRIED OR NOT HE COULD USE
HER MONEY
WHEN SHE WOULDN'T DO IT HE KEPT ON WORRYING HER UNTIL
SHE GOT BRAIN FEVER AND FOR SIX WEEKS WAS AT DEATH'S DOOR
THEN
SHE GOT BETTER AT LAST ALL WORN TO A SHADOW AND WITH HER
BEAUTIFUL HAIR CUT OFF BUT THAT DIDN'T MAKE NO CHANGE IN HER
YOUNG MAN AND HE STUCK TO HER AS TRUE AS MAN COULD BE
AH SAID HOLMES I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH
TO TELL US MAKES THE MATTER FAIRLY CLEAR AND THAT I CAN DEDUCE
ALL THAT REMAINS
MR
RUCASTLE THEN I PRESUME TOOK TO THIS
SYSTEM OF IMPRISONMENT
YES SIR
AND BROUGHT MISS HUNTER DOWN FROM LONDON IN ORDER TO GET RID OF
THE DISAGREEABLE PERSISTENCE OF MR
FOWLER
THAT WAS IT SIR
BUT MR
FOWLER BEING A PERSEVERING MAN AS A GOOD SEAMAN SHOULD
BE BLOCKADED THE HOUSE AND HAVING MET YOU SUCCEEDED BY CERTAIN
ARGUMENTS METALLIC OR OTHERWISE IN CONVINCING YOU THAT YOUR
INTERESTS WERE THE SAME AS HIS
MR
FOWLER WAS A VERY KIND SPOKEN FREE HANDED GENTLEMAN SAID
MRS
TOLLER SERENELY
AND IN THIS WAY HE MANAGED THAT YOUR GOOD MAN SHOULD HAVE NO
WANT OF DRINK AND THAT A LADDER SHOULD BE READY AT THE MOMENT
WHEN YOUR MASTER HAD GONE OUT
YOU HAVE IT SIR JUST AS IT HAPPENED
I AM SURE WE OWE YOU AN APOLOGY MRS
TOLLER SAID HOLMES FOR
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY CLEARED UP EVERYTHING WHICH PUZZLED US
AND
HERE COMES THE COUNTRY SURGEON AND MRS
RUCASTLE SO I THINK
WATSON THAT WE HAD BEST ESCORT MISS HUNTER BACK TO WINCHESTER
AS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR LOCUS STANDI NOW IS RATHER A
QUESTIONABLE ONE
AND THUS WAS SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF THE SINISTER HOUSE WITH THE
COPPER BEECHES IN FRONT OF THE DOOR
MR
RUCASTLE SURVIVED BUT
WAS ALWAYS A BROKEN MAN KEPT ALIVE SOLELY THROUGH THE CARE OF
HIS DEVOTED WIFE
THEY STILL LIVE WITH THEIR OLD SERVANTS WHO
PROBABLY KNOW SO MUCH OF RUCASTLE'S PAST LIFE THAT HE FINDS IT
DIFFICULT TO PART FROM THEM
MR
FOWLER AND MISS RUCASTLE WERE
MARRIED BY SPECIAL LICENSE IN SOUTHAMPTON THE DAY AFTER THEIR
FLIGHT AND HE IS NOW THE HOLDER OF A GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT IN
THE ISLAND OF MAURITIUS
AS TO MISS VIOLET HUNTER MY FRIEND
HOLMES RATHER TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT MANIFESTED NO FURTHER
INTEREST IN HER WHEN ONCE SHE HAD CEASED TO BE THE CENTRE OF ONE
OF HIS PROBLEMS AND SHE IS NOW THE HEAD OF A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT
WALSALL WHERE I BELIEVE THAT SHE HAS MET WITH CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS

MEMOIRS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
ADVENTURE I
SILVER BLAZE
I AM AFRAID WATSON THAT I SHALL HAVE TO GO SAID HOLMES AS WE SAT
DOWN TOGETHER TO OUR BREAKFAST ONE MORNING
GO WHERE TO
TO DARTMOOR TO KING'S PYLAND
I WAS NOT SURPRISED
INDEED MY ONLY WONDER WAS THAT HE HAD NOT ALREADY
BEEN MIXED UP IN THIS EXTRAORDINARY CASE WHICH WAS THE ONE TOPIC OF
CONVERSATION THROUGH THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF ENGLAND
FOR A WHOLE DAY
MY COMPANION HAD RAMBLED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH HIS CHIN UPON HIS CHEST AND
HIS BROWS KNITTED CHARGING AND RECHARGING HIS PIPE WITH THE STRONGEST
BLACK TOBACCO AND ABSOLUTELY DEAF TO ANY OF MY QUESTIONS OR REMARKS
FRESH EDITIONS OF EVERY PAPER HAD BEEN SENT UP BY OUR NEWS AGENT ONLY
TO BE GLANCED OVER AND TOSSED DOWN INTO A CORNER
YET SILENT AS HE WAS
I KNEW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT IT WAS OVER WHICH HE WAS BROODING
THERE WAS
BUT ONE PROBLEM BEFORE THE PUBLIC WHICH COULD CHALLENGE HIS POWERS OF
ANALYSIS AND THAT WAS THE SINGULAR DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FAVORITE FOR
THE WESSEX CUP AND THE TRAGIC MURDER OF ITS TRAINER
WHEN THEREFORE
HE SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION OF SETTING OUT FOR THE SCENE OF THE
DRAMA IT WAS ONLY WHAT I HAD BOTH EXPECTED AND HOPED FOR
I SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO GO DOWN WITH YOU IF I SHOULD NOT BE IN THE
WAY SAID I
MY DEAR WATSON YOU WOULD CONFER A GREAT FAVOR UPON ME BY COMING
AND
I THINK THAT YOUR TIME WILL NOT BE MISSPENT FOR THERE ARE POINTS ABOUT
THE CASE WHICH PROMISE TO MAKE IT AN ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE ONE
WE HAVE I
THINK JUST TIME TO CATCH OUR TRAIN AT PADDINGTON AND I WILL GO FURTHER
INTO THE MATTER UPON OUR JOURNEY
YOU WOULD OBLIGE ME BY BRINGING WITH
YOU YOUR VERY EXCELLENT FIELD GLASS
AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT AN HOUR OR SO LATER I FOUND MYSELF IN THE
CORNER OF A FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE FLYING ALONG EN ROUTE FOR EXETER WHILE
SHERLOCK HOLMES WITH HIS SHARP EAGER FACE FRAMED IN HIS EAR FLAPPED
TRAVELLING CAP DIPPED RAPIDLY INTO THE BUNDLE OF FRESH PAPERS WHICH HE
HAD PROCURED AT PADDINGTON
WE HAD LEFT READING FAR BEHIND US BEFORE
HE THRUST THE LAST ONE OF THEM UNDER THE SEAT AND OFFERED ME HIS
CIGAR CASE
WE ARE GOING WELL SAID HE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND GLANCING AT HIS
WATCH
OUR RATE AT PRESENT IS FIFTY THREE AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR
I HAVE NOT OBSERVED THE QUARTER MILE POSTS SAID I
NOR HAVE I
BUT THE TELEGRAPH POSTS UPON THIS LINE ARE SIXTY YARDS
APART AND THE CALCULATION IS A SIMPLE ONE
I PRESUME THAT YOU
HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS MATTER OF THE MURDER OF JOHN STRAKER AND THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF SILVER BLAZE
I HAVE SEEN WHAT THE TELEGRAPH AND THE CHRONICLE HAVE TO SAY
IT IS ONE OF THOSE CASES WHERE THE ART OF THE REASONER SHOULD BE
USED RATHER FOR THE SIFTING OF DETAILS THAN FOR THE ACQUIRING OF FRESH
EVIDENCE
THE TRAGEDY HAS BEEN SO UNCOMMON SO COMPLETE AND OF SUCH
PERSONAL IMPORTANCE TO SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WE ARE SUFFERING FROM A
PLETHORA OF SURMISE CONJECTURE AND HYPOTHESIS
THE DIFFICULTY IS TO
DETACH THE FRAMEWORK OF FACT OF ABSOLUTE UNDENIABLE FACT FROM THE
EMBELLISHMENTS OF THEORISTS AND REPORTERS
THEN HAVING ESTABLISHED
OURSELVES UPON THIS SOUND BASIS IT IS OUR DUTY TO SEE WHAT INFERENCES
MAY BE DRAWN AND WHAT ARE THE SPECIAL POINTS UPON WHICH THE WHOLE
MYSTERY TURNS
ON TUESDAY EVENING I RECEIVED TELEGRAMS FROM BOTH COLONEL
ROSS THE OWNER OF THE HORSE AND FROM INSPECTOR GREGORY WHO IS LOOKING
AFTER THE CASE INVITING MY COOPERATION
TUESDAY EVENING I EXCLAIMED
AND THIS IS THURSDAY MORNING
WHY
DIDN'T YOU GO DOWN YESTERDAY
BECAUSE I MADE A BLUNDER MY DEAR WATSON WHICH IS I AM AFRAID A MORE
COMMON OCCURRENCE THAN ANY ONE WOULD THINK WHO ONLY KNEW ME THROUGH YOUR
MEMOIRS
THE FACT IS THAT I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT THE MOST
REMARKABLE HORSE IN ENGLAND COULD LONG REMAIN CONCEALED ESPECIALLY IN
SO SPARSELY INHABITED A PLACE AS THE NORTH OF DARTMOOR
FROM HOUR TO
HOUR YESTERDAY I EXPECTED TO HEAR THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT
HIS ABDUCTOR WAS THE MURDERER OF JOHN STRAKER
WHEN HOWEVER ANOTHER
MORNING HAD COME AND I FOUND THAT BEYOND THE ARREST OF YOUNG FITZROY
SIMPSON NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE I FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO TAKE
ACTION
YET IN SOME WAYS I FEEL THAT YESTERDAY HAS NOT BEEN WASTED
YOU HAVE FORMED A THEORY THEN
AT LEAST I HAVE GOT A GRIP OF THE ESSENTIAL FACTS OF THE CASE
I SHALL
ENUMERATE THEM TO YOU FOR NOTHING CLEARS UP A CASE SO MUCH AS STATING
IT TO ANOTHER PERSON AND I CAN HARDLY EXPECT YOUR CO OPERATION IF I DO
NOT SHOW YOU THE POSITION FROM WHICH WE START
I LAY BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS PUFFING AT MY CIGAR WHILE HOLMES
LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS LONG THIN FOREFINGER CHECKING OFF THE POINTS
UPON THE PALM OF HIS LEFT HAND GAVE ME A SKETCH OF THE EVENTS WHICH HAD
LED TO OUR JOURNEY
SILVER BLAZE SAID HE IS FROM THE SOMOMY STOCK AND HOLDS AS
BRILLIANT A RECORD AS HIS FAMOUS ANCESTOR
HE IS NOW IN HIS FIFTH YEAR
AND HAS BROUGHT IN TURN EACH OF THE PRIZES OF THE TURF TO COLONEL ROSS
HIS FORTUNATE OWNER
UP TO THE TIME OF THE CATASTROPHE HE WAS THE FIRST
FAVORITE FOR THE WESSEX CUP THE BETTING BEING THREE TO ONE ON HIM
HE
HAS ALWAYS HOWEVER BEEN A PRIME FAVORITE WITH THE RACING PUBLIC AND
HAS NEVER YET DISAPPOINTED THEM SO THAT EVEN AT THOSE ODDS ENORMOUS
SUMS OF MONEY HAVE BEEN LAID UPON HIM
IT IS OBVIOUS THEREFORE THAT
THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAD THE STRONGEST INTEREST IN PREVENTING
SILVER BLAZE FROM BEING THERE AT THE FALL OF THE FLAG NEXT TUESDAY
THE FACT WAS OF COURSE APPRECIATED AT KING'S PYLAND WHERE THE
COLONEL'S TRAINING STABLE IS SITUATED
EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO
GUARD THE FAVORITE
THE TRAINER JOHN STRAKER IS A RETIRED JOCKEY
WHO RODE IN COLONEL ROSS'S COLORS BEFORE HE BECAME TOO HEAVY FOR THE
WEIGHING CHAIR
HE HAS SERVED THE COLONEL FOR FIVE YEARS AS JOCKEY AND
FOR SEVEN AS TRAINER AND HAS ALWAYS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE A ZEALOUS AND
HONEST SERVANT
UNDER HIM WERE THREE LADS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT WAS A
SMALL ONE CONTAINING ONLY FOUR HORSES IN ALL
ONE OF THESE LADS SAT UP
EACH NIGHT IN THE STABLE WHILE THE OTHERS SLEPT IN THE LOFT
ALL THREE
BORE EXCELLENT CHARACTERS
JOHN STRAKER WHO IS A MARRIED MAN LIVED
IN A SMALL VILLA ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE STABLES
HE HAS NO
CHILDREN KEEPS ONE MAID SERVANT AND IS COMFORTABLY OFF
THE COUNTRY
ROUND IS VERY LONELY BUT ABOUT HALF A MILE TO THE NORTH THERE IS A
SMALL CLUSTER OF VILLAS WHICH HAVE BEEN BUILT BY A TAVISTOCK CONTRACTOR
FOR THE USE OF INVALIDS AND OTHERS WHO MAY WISH TO ENJOY THE PURE
DARTMOOR AIR
TAVISTOCK ITSELF LIES TWO MILES TO THE WEST WHILE
ACROSS THE MOOR ALSO ABOUT TWO MILES DISTANT IS THE LARGER TRAINING
ESTABLISHMENT OF MAPLETON WHICH BELONGS TO LORD BACKWATER AND IS
MANAGED BY SILAS BROWN
IN EVERY OTHER DIRECTION THE MOOR IS A COMPLETE
WILDERNESS INHABITED ONLY BY A FEW ROAMING GYPSIES
SUCH WAS THE
GENERAL SITUATION LAST MONDAY NIGHT WHEN THE CATASTROPHE OCCURRED
ON THAT EVENING THE HORSES HAD BEEN EXERCISED AND WATERED AS USUAL AND
THE STABLES WERE LOCKED UP AT NINE O'CLOCK
TWO OF THE LADS WALKED UP
TO THE TRAINER'S HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD SUPPER IN THE KITCHEN WHILE THE
THIRD NED HUNTER REMAINED ON GUARD
AT A FEW MINUTES AFTER NINE
THE MAID EDITH BAXTER CARRIED DOWN TO THE STABLES HIS SUPPER WHICH
CONSISTED OF A DISH OF CURRIED MUTTON
SHE TOOK NO LIQUID AS THERE WAS
A WATER TAP IN THE STABLES AND IT WAS THE RULE THAT THE LAD ON DUTY
SHOULD DRINK NOTHING ELSE
THE MAID CARRIED A LANTERN WITH HER AS IT
WAS VERY DARK AND THE PATH RAN ACROSS THE OPEN MOOR
EDITH BAXTER WAS WITHIN THIRTY YARDS OF THE STABLES WHEN A MAN
APPEARED OUT OF THE DARKNESS AND CALLED TO HER TO STOP
AS HE STEPPED
INTO THE CIRCLE OF YELLOW LIGHT THROWN BY THE LANTERN SHE SAW THAT HE
WAS A PERSON OF GENTLEMANLY BEARING DRESSED IN A GRAY SUIT OF TWEEDS
WITH A CLOTH CAP
HE WORE GAITERS AND CARRIED A HEAVY STICK WITH A KNOB
TO IT
SHE WAS MOST IMPRESSED HOWEVER BY THE EXTREME PALLOR OF HIS
FACE AND BY THE NERVOUSNESS OF HIS MANNER
HIS AGE SHE THOUGHT WOULD
BE RATHER OVER THIRTY THAN UNDER IT
'CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I AM HE ASKED
'I HAD ALMOST MADE UP MY MIND
TO SLEEP ON THE MOOR WHEN I SAW THE LIGHT OF YOUR LANTERN
'YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE KING'S PYLAND TRAINING STABLES SAID SHE
'OH INDEED WHAT A STROKE OF LUCK HE CRIED
'I UNDERSTAND THAT A
STABLE BOY SLEEPS THERE ALONE EVERY NIGHT
PERHAPS THAT IS HIS SUPPER
WHICH YOU ARE CARRYING TO HIM
NOW I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE TOO
PROUD TO EARN THE PRICE OF A NEW DRESS WOULD YOU HE TOOK A PIECE OF
WHITE PAPER FOLDED UP OUT OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
'SEE THAT THE BOY
HAS THIS TO NIGHT AND YOU SHALL HAVE THE PRETTIEST FROCK THAT MONEY CAN
BUY
SHE WAS FRIGHTENED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS MANNER AND RAN PAST HIM
TO THE WINDOW THROUGH WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO HAND THE MEALS
IT WAS
ALREADY OPENED AND HUNTER WAS SEATED AT THE SMALL TABLE INSIDE
SHE HAD
BEGUN TO TELL HIM OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN THE STRANGER CAME UP AGAIN
'GOOD EVENING SAID HE LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW
'I WANTED TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU THE GIRL HAS SWORN THAT AS HE SPOKE SHE NOTICED THE
CORNER OF THE LITTLE PAPER PACKET PROTRUDING FROM HIS CLOSED HAND
'WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU HERE ASKED THE LAD
'IT'S BUSINESS THAT MAY PUT SOMETHING INTO YOUR POCKET SAID THE
OTHER
'YOU'VE TWO HORSES IN FOR THE WESSEX CUP SILVER BLAZE AND
BAYARD
LET ME HAVE THE STRAIGHT TIP AND YOU WON'T BE A LOSER
IS IT A
FACT THAT AT THE WEIGHTS BAYARD COULD GIVE THE OTHER A HUNDRED YARDS IN
FIVE FURLONGS AND THAT THE STABLE HAVE PUT THEIR MONEY ON HIM
'SO YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE DAMNED TOUTS CRIED THE LAD
'I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW WE SERVE THEM IN KING'S PYLAND HE SPRANG UP AND RUSHED ACROSS THE
STABLE TO UNLOOSE THE DOG
THE GIRL FLED AWAY TO THE HOUSE BUT AS SHE
RAN SHE LOOKED BACK AND SAW THAT THE STRANGER WAS LEANING THROUGH THE
WINDOW
A MINUTE LATER HOWEVER WHEN HUNTER RUSHED OUT WITH THE HOUND
HE WAS GONE AND THOUGH HE RAN ALL ROUND THE BUILDINGS HE FAILED TO FIND
ANY TRACE OF HIM
ONE MOMENT I ASKED
DID THE STABLE BOY WHEN HE RAN OUT WITH THE
DOG LEAVE THE DOOR UNLOCKED BEHIND HIM
EXCELLENT WATSON EXCELLENT MURMURED MY COMPANION
THE IMPORTANCE
OF THE POINT STRUCK ME SO FORCIBLY THAT I SENT A SPECIAL WIRE TO
DARTMOOR YESTERDAY TO CLEAR THE MATTER UP
THE BOY LOCKED THE DOOR
BEFORE HE LEFT IT
THE WINDOW I MAY ADD WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH FOR A MAN
TO GET THROUGH
HUNTER WAITED UNTIL HIS FELLOW GROOMS HAD RETURNED WHEN HE SENT A
MESSAGE TO THE TRAINER AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
STRAKER WAS
EXCITED AT HEARING THE ACCOUNT ALTHOUGH HE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE QUITE
REALIZED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE
IT LEFT HIM HOWEVER VAGUELY UNEASY
AND MRS
STRAKER WAKING AT ONE IN THE MORNING FOUND THAT HE WAS
DRESSING
IN REPLY TO HER INQUIRIES HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP ON
ACCOUNT OF HIS ANXIETY ABOUT THE HORSES AND THAT HE INTENDED TO WALK
DOWN TO THE STABLES TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL
SHE BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN
AT HOME AS SHE COULD HEAR THE RAIN PATTERING AGAINST THE WINDOW BUT IN
SPITE OF HER ENTREATIES HE PULLED ON HIS LARGE MACKINTOSH AND LEFT THE
HOUSE
MRS
STRAKER AWOKE AT SEVEN IN THE MORNING TO FIND THAT HER HUSBAND
HAD NOT YET RETURNED
SHE DRESSED HERSELF HASTILY CALLED THE MAID AND
SET OFF FOR THE STABLES
THE DOOR WAS OPEN INSIDE HUDDLED TOGETHER
UPON A CHAIR HUNTER WAS SUNK IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE STUPOR THE
FAVORITE'S STALL WAS EMPTY AND THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HIS TRAINER
THE TWO LADS WHO SLEPT IN THE CHAFF CUTTING LOFT ABOVE THE HARNESS ROOM
WERE QUICKLY AROUSED
THEY HAD HEARD NOTHING DURING THE NIGHT FOR THEY
ARE BOTH SOUND SLEEPERS
HUNTER WAS OBVIOUSLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF
SOME POWERFUL DRUG AND AS NO SENSE COULD BE GOT OUT OF HIM HE WAS LEFT
TO SLEEP IT OFF WHILE THE TWO LADS AND THE TWO WOMEN RAN OUT IN SEARCH
OF THE ABSENTEES
THEY STILL HAD HOPES THAT THE TRAINER HAD FOR SOME
REASON TAKEN OUT THE HORSE FOR EARLY EXERCISE BUT ON ASCENDING THE
KNOLL NEAR THE HOUSE FROM WHICH ALL THE NEIGHBORING MOORS WERE VISIBLE
THEY NOT ONLY COULD SEE NO SIGNS OF THE MISSING FAVORITE BUT THEY
PERCEIVED SOMETHING WHICH WARNED THEM THAT THEY WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF
A TRAGEDY
ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE STABLES JOHN STRAKER'S OVERCOAT WAS
FLAPPING FROM A FURZE BUSH
IMMEDIATELY BEYOND THERE WAS A BOWL SHAPED
DEPRESSION IN THE MOOR AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS WAS FOUND THE DEAD
BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE TRAINER
HIS HEAD HAD BEEN SHATTERED BY A SAVAGE
BLOW FROM SOME HEAVY WEAPON AND HE WAS WOUNDED ON THE THIGH WHERE
THERE WAS A LONG CLEAN CUT INFLICTED EVIDENTLY BY SOME VERY SHARP
INSTRUMENT
IT WAS CLEAR HOWEVER THAT STRAKER HAD DEFENDED HIMSELF
VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS ASSAILANTS FOR IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE HELD A SMALL
KNIFE WHICH WAS CLOTTED WITH BLOOD UP TO THE HANDLE WHILE IN HIS LEFT
HE CLASPED A RED AND BLACK SILK CRAVAT WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE MAID
AS HAVING BEEN WORN ON THE PRECEDING EVENING BY THE STRANGER WHO HAD
VISITED THE STABLES
HUNTER ON RECOVERING FROM HIS STUPOR WAS ALSO
QUITE POSITIVE AS TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE CRAVAT
HE WAS EQUALLY CERTAIN
THAT THE SAME STRANGER HAD WHILE STANDING AT THE WINDOW DRUGGED HIS
CURRIED MUTTON AND SO DEPRIVED THE STABLES OF THEIR WATCHMAN
AS TO THE
MISSING HORSE THERE WERE ABUNDANT PROOFS IN THE MUD WHICH LAY AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE FATAL HOLLOW THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE AT THE TIME OF THE
STRUGGLE
BUT FROM THAT MORNING HE HAS DISAPPEARED AND ALTHOUGH A LARGE
REWARD HAS BEEN OFFERED AND ALL THE GYPSIES OF DARTMOOR ARE ON THE
ALERT NO NEWS HAS COME OF HIM
FINALLY AN ANALYSIS HAS SHOWN THAT
THE REMAINS OF HIS SUPPER LEFT BY THE STABLE LAD CONTAIN AN APPRECIABLE
QUANTITY OF POWDERED OPIUM WHILE THE PEOPLE AT THE HOUSE PARTOOK OF THE
SAME DISH ON THE SAME NIGHT WITHOUT ANY ILL EFFECT
THOSE ARE THE MAIN FACTS OF THE CASE STRIPPED OF ALL SURMISE AND
STATED AS BALDLY AS POSSIBLE
I SHALL NOW RECAPITULATE WHAT THE POLICE
HAVE DONE IN THE MATTER
INSPECTOR GREGORY TO WHOM THE CASE HAS BEEN COMMITTED IS AN EXTREMELY
COMPETENT OFFICER
WERE HE BUT GIFTED WITH IMAGINATION HE MIGHT RISE TO
GREAT HEIGHTS IN HIS PROFESSION
ON HIS ARRIVAL HE PROMPTLY FOUND AND
ARRESTED THE MAN UPON WHOM SUSPICION NATURALLY RESTED
THERE WAS LITTLE
DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HIM FOR HE INHABITED ONE OF THOSE VILLAS WHICH I
HAVE MENTIONED
HIS NAME IT APPEARS WAS FITZROY SIMPSON
HE WAS A MAN
OF EXCELLENT BIRTH AND EDUCATION WHO HAD SQUANDERED A FORTUNE UPON THE
TURF AND WHO LIVED NOW BY DOING A LITTLE QUIET AND GENTEEL BOOK MAKING
IN THE SPORTING CLUBS OF LONDON
AN EXAMINATION OF HIS BETTING BOOK
SHOWS THAT BETS TO THE AMOUNT OF FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS HAD BEEN
REGISTERED BY HIM AGAINST THE FAVORITE
ON BEING ARRESTED HE VOLUNTEERED
THE STATEMENT THAT HE HAD COME DOWN TO DARTMOOR IN THE HOPE OF
GETTING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE KING'S PYLAND HORSES AND ALSO ABOUT
DESBOROUGH THE SECOND FAVORITE WHICH WAS IN CHARGE OF SILAS BROWN AT
THE MAPLETON STABLES
HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY THAT HE HAD ACTED AS
DESCRIBED UPON THE EVENING BEFORE BUT DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO SINISTER
DESIGNS AND HAD SIMPLY WISHED TO OBTAIN FIRST HAND INFORMATION
WHEN
CONFRONTED WITH HIS CRAVAT HE TURNED VERY PALE AND WAS UTTERLY UNABLE
TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS PRESENCE IN THE HAND OF THE MURDERED MAN
HIS WET
CLOTHING SHOWED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT IN THE STORM OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
AND HIS STICK WHICH WAS A PENANG LAWYER WEIGHTED WITH LEAD WAS JUST
SUCH A WEAPON AS MIGHT BY REPEATED BLOWS HAVE INFLICTED THE TERRIBLE
INJURIES TO WHICH THE TRAINER HAD SUCCUMBED
ON THE OTHER HAND THERE
WAS NO WOUND UPON HIS PERSON WHILE THE STATE OF STRAKER'S KNIFE WOULD
SHOW THAT ONE AT LEAST OF HIS ASSAILANTS MUST BEAR HIS MARK UPON HIM
THERE YOU HAVE IT ALL IN A NUTSHELL WATSON AND IF YOU CAN GIVE ME ANY
LIGHT I SHALL BE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU
I HAD LISTENED WITH THE GREATEST INTEREST TO THE STATEMENT WHICH HOLMES
WITH CHARACTERISTIC CLEARNESS HAD LAID BEFORE ME
THOUGH MOST OF THE
FACTS WERE FAMILIAR TO ME I HAD NOT SUFFICIENTLY APPRECIATED THEIR
RELATIVE IMPORTANCE NOR THEIR CONNECTION TO EACH OTHER
IS IT NOT POSSIBLE I SUGGESTED THAT THE INCISED WOUND UPON STRAKER
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY HIS OWN KNIFE IN THE CONVULSIVE STRUGGLES WHICH
FOLLOW ANY BRAIN INJURY
IT IS MORE THAN POSSIBLE IT IS PROBABLE SAID HOLMES
IN THAT CASE
ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS IN FAVOR OF THE ACCUSED DISAPPEARS
AND YET SAID I EVEN NOW I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE THEORY OF THE
POLICE CAN BE
I AM AFRAID THAT WHATEVER THEORY WE STATE HAS VERY GRAVE OBJECTIONS TO
IT RETURNED MY COMPANION
THE POLICE IMAGINE I TAKE IT THAT THIS
FITZROY SIMPSON HAVING DRUGGED THE LAD AND HAVING IN SOME WAY OBTAINED
A DUPLICATE KEY OPENED THE STABLE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE HORSE WITH
THE INTENTION APPARENTLY OF KIDNAPPING HIM ALTOGETHER
HIS BRIDLE IS
MISSING SO THAT SIMPSON MUST HAVE PUT THIS ON
THEN HAVING LEFT THE
DOOR OPEN BEHIND HIM HE WAS LEADING THE HORSE AWAY OVER THE MOOR WHEN
HE WAS EITHER MET OR OVERTAKEN BY THE TRAINER
A ROW NATURALLY ENSUED
SIMPSON BEAT OUT THE TRAINER'S BRAINS WITH HIS HEAVY STICK WITHOUT
RECEIVING ANY INJURY FROM THE SMALL KNIFE WHICH STRAKER USED IN
SELF DEFENCE AND THEN THE THIEF EITHER LED THE HORSE ON TO SOME SECRET
HIDING PLACE OR ELSE IT MAY HAVE BOLTED DURING THE STRUGGLE AND BE
NOW WANDERING OUT ON THE MOORS
THAT IS THE CASE AS IT APPEARS TO
THE POLICE AND IMPROBABLE AS IT IS ALL OTHER EXPLANATIONS ARE MORE
IMPROBABLE STILL
HOWEVER I SHALL VERY QUICKLY TEST THE MATTER WHEN I
AM ONCE UPON THE SPOT AND UNTIL THEN I CANNOT REALLY SEE HOW WE CAN GET
MUCH FURTHER THAN OUR PRESENT POSITION
IT WAS EVENING BEFORE WE REACHED THE LITTLE TOWN OF TAVISTOCK WHICH
LIES LIKE THE BOSS OF A SHIELD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUGE CIRCLE OF
DARTMOOR
TWO GENTLEMEN WERE AWAITING US IN THE STATION THE ONE A TALL
FAIR MAN WITH LION LIKE HAIR AND BEARD AND CURIOUSLY PENETRATING LIGHT
BLUE EYES THE OTHER A SMALL ALERT PERSON VERY NEAT AND DAPPER IN A
FROCK COAT AND GAITERS WITH TRIM LITTLE SIDE WHISKERS AND AN EYE GLASS
THE LATTER WAS COLONEL ROSS THE WELL KNOWN SPORTSMAN THE OTHER
INSPECTOR GREGORY A MAN WHO WAS RAPIDLY MAKING HIS NAME IN THE ENGLISH
DETECTIVE SERVICE
I AM DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME DOWN MR
HOLMES SAID THE COLONEL
THE INSPECTOR HERE HAS DONE ALL THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SUGGESTED BUT I
WISH TO LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED IN TRYING TO AVENGE POOR STRAKER AND IN
RECOVERING MY HORSE
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY FRESH DEVELOPMENTS ASKED HOLMES
I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS SAID THE
INSPECTOR
WE HAVE AN OPEN CARRIAGE OUTSIDE AND AS YOU WOULD NO DOUBT
LIKE TO SEE THE PLACE BEFORE THE LIGHT FAILS WE MIGHT TALK IT OVER AS
WE DRIVE
A MINUTE LATER WE WERE ALL SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE LANDAU AND WERE
RATTLING THROUGH THE QUAINT OLD DEVONSHIRE CITY
INSPECTOR GREGORY WAS
FULL OF HIS CASE AND POURED OUT A STREAM OF REMARKS WHILE HOLMES THREW
IN AN OCCASIONAL QUESTION OR INTERJECTION
COLONEL ROSS LEANED BACK WITH
HIS ARMS FOLDED AND HIS HAT TILTED OVER HIS EYES WHILE I LISTENED WITH
INTEREST TO THE DIALOGUE OF THE TWO DETECTIVES
GREGORY WAS FORMULATING
HIS THEORY WHICH WAS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT HOLMES HAD FORETOLD IN THE
TRAIN
THE NET IS DRAWN PRETTY CLOSE ROUND FITZROY SIMPSON HE REMARKED AND
I BELIEVE MYSELF THAT HE IS OUR MAN
AT THE SAME TIME I RECOGNIZE THAT
THE EVIDENCE IS PURELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND THAT SOME NEW DEVELOPMENT MAY
UPSET IT
HOW ABOUT STRAKER'S KNIFE
WE HAVE QUITE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE WOUNDED HIMSELF IN HIS
FALL
MY FRIEND DR
WATSON MADE THAT SUGGESTION TO ME AS WE CAME DOWN
IF SO
IT WOULD TELL AGAINST THIS MAN SIMPSON
UNDOUBTEDLY
HE HAS NEITHER A KNIFE NOR ANY SIGN OF A WOUND
THE
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM IS CERTAINLY VERY STRONG
HE HAD A GREAT INTEREST
IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FAVORITE
HE LIES UNDER SUSPICION OF HAVING
POISONED THE STABLE BOY HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY OUT IN THE STORM HE WAS
ARMED WITH A HEAVY STICK AND HIS CRAVAT WAS FOUND IN THE DEAD MAN'S
HAND
I REALLY THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GO BEFORE A JURY
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD
A CLEVER COUNSEL WOULD TEAR IT ALL TO RAGS
SAID HE
WHY SHOULD HE TAKE THE HORSE OUT OF THE STABLE IF HE WISHED
TO INJURE IT WHY COULD HE NOT DO IT THERE HAS A DUPLICATE KEY BEEN
FOUND IN HIS POSSESSION WHAT CHEMIST SOLD HIM THE POWDERED OPIUM ABOVE
ALL WHERE COULD HE A STRANGER TO THE DISTRICT HIDE A HORSE AND SUCH
A HORSE AS THIS WHAT IS HIS OWN EXPLANATION AS TO THE PAPER WHICH HE
WISHED THE MAID TO GIVE TO THE STABLE BOY
HE SAYS THAT IT WAS A TEN POUND NOTE
ONE WAS FOUND IN HIS PURSE
BUT
YOUR OTHER DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS THEY SEEM
HE IS NOT
A STRANGER TO THE DISTRICT
HE HAS TWICE LODGED AT TAVISTOCK IN THE
SUMMER
THE OPIUM WAS PROBABLY BROUGHT FROM LONDON
THE KEY HAVING
SERVED ITS PURPOSE WOULD BE HURLED AWAY
THE HORSE MAY BE AT THE BOTTOM
OF ONE OF THE PITS OR OLD MINES UPON THE MOOR
WHAT DOES HE SAY ABOUT THE CRAVAT
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS HIS AND DECLARES THAT HE HAD LOST IT
BUT A
NEW ELEMENT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE CASE WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR HIS
LEADING THE HORSE FROM THE STABLE
HOLMES PRICKED UP HIS EARS
WE HAVE FOUND TRACES WHICH SHOW THAT A PARTY OF GYPSIES ENCAMPED ON
MONDAY NIGHT WITHIN A MILE OF THE SPOT WHERE THE MURDER TOOK PLACE
ON
TUESDAY THEY WERE GONE
NOW PRESUMING THAT THERE WAS SOME UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN SIMPSON AND THESE GYPSIES MIGHT HE NOT HAVE BEEN LEADING THE
HORSE TO THEM WHEN HE WAS OVERTAKEN AND MAY THEY NOT HAVE HIM NOW
IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE
THE MOOR IS BEING SCOURED FOR THESE GYPSIES
I HAVE ALSO EXAMINED EVERY
STABLE AND OUT HOUSE IN TAVISTOCK AND FOR A RADIUS OF TEN MILES
THERE IS ANOTHER TRAINING STABLE QUITE CLOSE I UNDERSTAND
YES AND THAT IS A FACTOR WHICH WE MUST CERTAINLY NOT NEGLECT
AS
DESBOROUGH THEIR HORSE WAS SECOND IN THE BETTING THEY HAD AN INTEREST
IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE FAVORITE
SILAS BROWN THE TRAINER IS KNOWN
TO HAVE HAD LARGE BETS UPON THE EVENT AND HE WAS NO FRIEND TO POOR
STRAKER
WE HAVE HOWEVER EXAMINED THE STABLES AND THERE IS NOTHING TO
CONNECT HIM WITH THE AFFAIR
AND NOTHING TO CONNECT THIS MAN SIMPSON WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE
MAPLETON STABLES
NOTHING AT ALL
HOLMES LEANED BACK IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE CONVERSATION CEASED
A FEW
MINUTES LATER OUR DRIVER PULLED UP AT A NEAT LITTLE RED BRICK VILLA WITH
OVERHANGING EAVES WHICH STOOD BY THE ROAD
SOME DISTANCE OFF ACROSS A
PADDOCK LAY A LONG GRAY TILED OUT BUILDING
IN EVERY OTHER DIRECTION
THE LOW CURVES OF THE MOOR BRONZE COLORED FROM THE FADING FERNS
STRETCHED AWAY TO THE SKY LINE BROKEN ONLY BY THE STEEPLES OF
TAVISTOCK AND BY A CLUSTER OF HOUSES AWAY TO THE WESTWARD WHICH MARKED
THE MAPLETON STABLES
WE ALL SPRANG OUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HOLMES
WHO CONTINUED TO LEAN BACK WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE SKY IN FRONT OF
HIM ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS
IT WAS ONLY WHEN I TOUCHED
HIS ARM THAT HE ROUSED HIMSELF WITH A VIOLENT START AND STEPPED OUT OF
THE CARRIAGE
EXCUSE ME SAID HE TURNING TO COLONEL ROSS WHO HAD LOOKED AT HIM IN
SOME SURPRISE
I WAS DAY DREAMING THERE WAS A GLEAM IN HIS EYES AND A
SUPPRESSED EXCITEMENT IN HIS MANNER WHICH CONVINCED ME USED AS I WAS
TO HIS WAYS THAT HIS HAND WAS UPON A CLUE THOUGH I COULD NOT IMAGINE
WHERE HE HAD FOUND IT
PERHAPS YOU WOULD PREFER AT ONCE TO GO ON TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
MR
HOLMES SAID GREGORY
I THINK THAT I SHOULD PREFER TO STAY HERE A LITTLE AND GO INTO ONE OR
TWO QUESTIONS OF DETAIL
STRAKER WAS BROUGHT BACK HERE I PRESUME
YES HE LIES UPSTAIRS
THE INQUEST IS TO MORROW
HE HAS BEEN IN YOUR SERVICE SOME YEARS COLONEL ROSS
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND HIM AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
I PRESUME THAT YOU MADE AN INVENTORY OF WHAT HE HAD IN HIS POCKETS AT
THE TIME OF HIS DEATH INSPECTOR
I HAVE THE THINGS THEMSELVES IN THE SITTING ROOM IF YOU WOULD CARE TO
SEE THEM
I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD WE ALL FILED INTO THE FRONT ROOM AND SAT ROUND
THE CENTRAL TABLE WHILE THE INSPECTOR UNLOCKED A SQUARE TIN BOX AND LAID
A SMALL HEAP OF THINGS BEFORE US
THERE WAS A BOX OF VESTAS TWO INCHES
OF TALLOW CANDLE AN A D P BRIER ROOT PIPE A POUCH OF SEAL SKIN WITH
HALF AN OUNCE OF LONG CUT CAVENDISH A SILVER WATCH WITH A GOLD CHAIN
FIVE SOVEREIGNS IN GOLD AN ALUMINUM PENCIL CASE A FEW PAPERS AND AN
IVORY HANDLED KNIFE WITH A VERY DELICATE INFLEXIBLE BLADE MARKED WEISS
CO LONDON
THIS IS A VERY SINGULAR KNIFE SAID HOLMES LIFTING IT UP AND
EXAMINING IT MINUTELY
I PRESUME AS I SEE BLOOD STAINS UPON IT THAT
IT IS THE ONE WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE DEAD MAN'S GRASP
WATSON THIS
KNIFE IS SURELY IN YOUR LINE
IT IS WHAT WE CALL A CATARACT KNIFE SAID I
I THOUGHT SO
A VERY DELICATE BLADE DEVISED FOR VERY DELICATE WORK
A STRANGE THING FOR A MAN TO CARRY WITH HIM UPON A ROUGH EXPEDITION
ESPECIALLY AS IT WOULD NOT SHUT IN HIS POCKET
THE TIP WAS GUARDED BY A DISK OF CORK WHICH WE FOUND BESIDE HIS BODY
SAID THE INSPECTOR
HIS WIFE TELLS US THAT THE KNIFE HAD LAIN UPON THE
DRESSING TABLE AND THAT HE HAD PICKED IT UP AS HE LEFT THE ROOM
IT WAS
A POOR WEAPON BUT PERHAPS THE BEST THAT HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON AT
THE MOMENT
VERY POSSIBLE
HOW ABOUT THESE PAPERS
THREE OF THEM ARE RECEIPTED HAY DEALERS' ACCOUNTS
ONE OF THEM IS A
LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS FROM COLONEL ROSS
THIS OTHER IS A MILLINER'S
ACCOUNT FOR THIRTY SEVEN POUNDS FIFTEEN MADE OUT BY MADAME LESURIER
OF BOND STREET TO WILLIAM DERBYSHIRE
MRS
STRAKER TELLS US THAT
DERBYSHIRE WAS A FRIEND OF HER HUSBAND'S AND THAT OCCASIONALLY HIS
LETTERS WERE ADDRESSED HERE
MADAM DERBYSHIRE HAD SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE TASTES REMARKED HOLMES
GLANCING DOWN THE ACCOUNT
TWENTY TWO GUINEAS IS RATHER HEAVY FOR A
SINGLE COSTUME
HOWEVER THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING MORE TO LEARN AND
WE MAY NOW GO DOWN TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME
AS WE EMERGED FROM THE SITTING ROOM A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN WAITING IN
THE PASSAGE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND LAID HER HAND UPON THE INSPECTOR'S
SLEEVE
HER FACE WAS HAGGARD AND THIN AND EAGER STAMPED WITH THE PRINT
OF A RECENT HORROR
HAVE YOU GOT THEM HAVE YOU FOUND THEM SHE PANTED
NO MRS
STRAKER
BUT MR
HOLMES HERE HAS COME FROM LONDON TO HELP US
AND WE SHALL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE
SURELY I MET YOU IN PLYMOUTH AT A GARDEN PARTY SOME LITTLE TIME AGO
MRS
STRAKER SAID HOLMES
NO SIR YOU ARE MISTAKEN
DEAR ME WHY I COULD HAVE SWORN TO IT
YOU WORE A COSTUME OF
DOVE COLORED SILK WITH OSTRICH FEATHER TRIMMING
I NEVER HAD SUCH A DRESS SIR ANSWERED THE LADY
AH THAT QUITE SETTLES IT SAID HOLMES
AND WITH AN APOLOGY HE
FOLLOWED THE INSPECTOR OUTSIDE
A SHORT WALK ACROSS THE MOOR TOOK US TO
THE HOLLOW IN WHICH THE BODY HAD BEEN FOUND
AT THE BRINK OF IT WAS THE
FURZE BUSH UPON WHICH THE COAT HAD BEEN HUNG
THERE WAS NO WIND THAT NIGHT I UNDERSTAND SAID HOLMES
NONE BUT VERY HEAVY RAIN
IN THAT CASE THE OVERCOAT WAS NOT BLOWN AGAINST THE FURZE BUSH BUT
PLACED THERE
YES IT WAS LAID ACROSS THE BUSH
YOU FILL ME WITH INTEREST I PERCEIVE THAT THE GROUND HAS BEEN TRAMPLED
UP A GOOD DEAL
NO DOUBT MANY FEET HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE MONDAY NIGHT
A PIECE OF MATTING HAS BEEN LAID HERE AT THE SIDE AND WE HAVE ALL
STOOD UPON THAT
EXCELLENT
IN THIS BAG I HAVE ONE OF THE BOOTS WHICH STRAKER WORE ONE OF FITZROY
SIMPSON'S SHOES AND A CAST HORSESHOE OF SILVER BLAZE
MY DEAR INSPECTOR YOU SURPASS YOURSELF HOLMES TOOK THE BAG AND
DESCENDING INTO THE HOLLOW HE PUSHED THE MATTING INTO A MORE CENTRAL
POSITION
THEN STRETCHING HIMSELF UPON HIS FACE AND LEANING HIS CHIN
UPON HIS HANDS HE MADE A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE TRAMPLED MUD IN FRONT OF
HIM
HULLO SAID HE SUDDENLY
WHAT'S THIS IT WAS A WAX VESTA HALF
BURNED WHICH WAS SO COATED WITH MUD THAT IT LOOKED AT FIRST LIKE A
LITTLE CHIP OF WOOD
I CANNOT THINK HOW I CAME TO OVERLOOK IT SAID THE INSPECTOR WITH AN
EXPRESSION OF ANNOYANCE
IT WAS INVISIBLE BURIED IN THE MUD
I ONLY SAW IT BECAUSE I WAS
LOOKING FOR IT
WHAT YOU EXPECTED TO FIND IT
I THOUGHT IT NOT UNLIKELY
HE TOOK THE BOOTS FROM THE BAG AND COMPARED THE IMPRESSIONS OF EACH OF
THEM WITH MARKS UPON THE GROUND
THEN HE CLAMBERED UP TO THE RIM OF THE
HOLLOW AND CRAWLED ABOUT AMONG THE FERNS AND BUSHES
I AM AFRAID THAT THERE ARE NO MORE TRACKS SAID THE INSPECTOR
I
HAVE EXAMINED THE GROUND VERY CAREFULLY FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN EACH
DIRECTION
INDEED SAID HOLMES RISING
I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE IMPERTINENCE TO
DO IT AGAIN AFTER WHAT YOU SAY
BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE WALK
OVER THE MOOR BEFORE IT GROWS DARK THAT I MAY KNOW MY GROUND TO MORROW
AND I THINK THAT I SHALL PUT THIS HORSESHOE INTO MY POCKET FOR LUCK
COLONEL ROSS WHO HAD SHOWN SOME SIGNS OF IMPATIENCE AT MY COMPANION'S
QUIET AND SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF WORK GLANCED AT HIS WATCH
I WISH YOU
WOULD COME BACK WITH ME INSPECTOR SAID HE
THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS
ON WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOUR ADVICE AND ESPECIALLY AS TO WHETHER WE DO
NOT OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC TO REMOVE OUR HORSE'S NAME FROM THE ENTRIES FOR
THE CUP
CERTAINLY NOT CRIED HOLMES WITH DECISION
I SHOULD LET THE NAME
STAND
THE COLONEL BOWED
I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE HAD YOUR OPINION SIR SAID
HE
YOU WILL FIND US AT POOR STRAKER'S HOUSE WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED
YOUR WALK AND WE CAN DRIVE TOGETHER INTO TAVISTOCK
HE TURNED BACK WITH THE INSPECTOR WHILE HOLMES AND I WALKED SLOWLY
ACROSS THE MOOR
THE SUN WAS BEGINNING TO SINK BEHIND THE STABLES OF
MAPLETON AND THE LONG SLOPING PLAIN IN FRONT OF US WAS TINGED WITH
GOLD DEEPENING INTO RICH RUDDY BROWNS WHERE THE FADED FERNS AND
BRAMBLES CAUGHT THE EVENING LIGHT
BUT THE GLORIES OF THE LANDSCAPE WERE
ALL WASTED UPON MY COMPANION WHO WAS SUNK IN THE DEEPEST THOUGHT
IT'S THIS WAY WATSON SAID HE AT LAST
WE MAY LEAVE THE QUESTION
OF WHO KILLED JOHN STRAKER FOR THE INSTANT AND CONFINE OURSELVES TO
FINDING OUT WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE HORSE
NOW SUPPOSING THAT HE BROKE
AWAY DURING OR AFTER THE TRAGEDY WHERE COULD HE HAVE GONE TO THE HORSE
IS A VERY GREGARIOUS CREATURE
IF LEFT TO HIMSELF HIS INSTINCTS WOULD
HAVE BEEN EITHER TO RETURN TO KING'S PYLAND OR GO OVER TO MAPLETON
WHY
SHOULD HE RUN WILD UPON THE MOOR HE WOULD SURELY HAVE BEEN SEEN BY NOW
AND WHY SHOULD GYPSIES KIDNAP HIM THESE PEOPLE ALWAYS CLEAR OUT WHEN
THEY HEAR OF TROUBLE FOR THEY DO NOT WISH TO BE PESTERED BY THE POLICE
THEY COULD NOT HOPE TO SELL SUCH A HORSE
THEY WOULD RUN A GREAT RISK
AND GAIN NOTHING BY TAKING HIM
SURELY THAT IS CLEAR
WHERE IS HE THEN
I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT HE MUST HAVE GONE TO KING'S PYLAND OR TO
MAPLETON
HE IS NOT AT KING'S PYLAND
THEREFORE HE IS AT MAPLETON
LET
US TAKE THAT AS A WORKING HYPOTHESIS AND SEE WHAT IT LEADS US TO
THIS
PART OF THE MOOR AS THE INSPECTOR REMARKED IS VERY HARD AND DRY
BUT
IT FALLS AWAY TOWARDS MAPLETON AND YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE THAT THERE
IS A LONG HOLLOW OVER YONDER WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY WET ON MONDAY
NIGHT
IF OUR SUPPOSITION IS CORRECT THEN THE HORSE MUST HAVE CROSSED
THAT AND THERE IS THE POINT WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK FOR HIS TRACKS
WE HAD BEEN WALKING BRISKLY DURING THIS CONVERSATION AND A FEW MORE
MINUTES BROUGHT US TO THE HOLLOW IN QUESTION
AT HOLMES' REQUEST I
WALKED DOWN THE BANK TO THE RIGHT AND HE TO THE LEFT BUT I HAD NOT
TAKEN FIFTY PACES BEFORE I HEARD HIM GIVE A SHOUT AND SAW HIM WAVING
HIS HAND TO ME
THE TRACK OF A HORSE WAS PLAINLY OUTLINED IN THE SOFT
EARTH IN FRONT OF HIM AND THE SHOE WHICH HE TOOK FROM HIS POCKET
EXACTLY FITTED THE IMPRESSION
SEE THE VALUE OF IMAGINATION SAID HOLMES
IT IS THE ONE QUALITY
WHICH GREGORY LACKS
WE IMAGINED WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED ACTED UPON
THE SUPPOSITION AND FIND OURSELVES JUSTIFIED
LET US PROCEED
WE CROSSED THE MARSHY BOTTOM AND PASSED OVER A QUARTER OF A MILE OF DRY
HARD TURF
AGAIN THE GROUND SLOPED AND AGAIN WE CAME ON THE TRACKS
THEN WE LOST THEM FOR HALF A MILE BUT ONLY TO PICK THEM UP ONCE MORE
QUITE CLOSE TO MAPLETON
IT WAS HOLMES WHO SAW THEM FIRST AND HE STOOD
POINTING WITH A LOOK OF TRIUMPH UPON HIS FACE
A MAN'S TRACK WAS VISIBLE
BESIDE THE HORSE'S
THE HORSE WAS ALONE BEFORE I CRIED
QUITE SO
IT WAS ALONE BEFORE
HULLO WHAT IS THIS
THE DOUBLE TRACK TURNED SHARP OFF AND TOOK THE DIRECTION OF KING'S
PYLAND
HOLMES WHISTLED AND WE BOTH FOLLOWED ALONG AFTER IT
HIS EYES
WERE ON THE TRAIL BUT I HAPPENED TO LOOK A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE AND
SAW TO MY SURPRISE THE SAME TRACKS COMING BACK AGAIN IN THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
ONE FOR YOU WATSON SAID HOLMES WHEN I POINTED IT OUT
YOU HAVE
SAVED US A LONG WALK WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT US BACK ON OUR OWN
TRACES
LET US FOLLOW THE RETURN TRACK
WE HAD NOT TO GO FAR
IT ENDED AT THE PAVING OF ASPHALT WHICH LED UP
TO THE GATES OF THE MAPLETON STABLES
AS WE APPROACHED A GROOM RAN OUT
FROM THEM
WE DON'T WANT ANY LOITERERS ABOUT HERE SAID HE
I ONLY WISHED TO ASK A QUESTION SAID HOLMES WITH HIS FINGER AND
THUMB IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
SHOULD I BE TOO EARLY TO SEE YOUR
MASTER MR
SILAS BROWN IF I WERE TO CALL AT FIVE O'CLOCK TO MORROW
MORNING
BLESS YOU SIR IF ANY ONE IS ABOUT HE WILL BE FOR HE IS ALWAYS
THE FIRST STIRRING
BUT HERE HE IS SIR TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS FOR
HIMSELF
NO SIR NO IT IS AS MUCH AS MY PLACE IS WORTH TO LET HIM SEE
ME TOUCH YOUR MONEY
AFTERWARDS IF YOU LIKE
AS SHERLOCK HOLMES REPLACED THE HALF CROWN WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM HIS
POCKET A FIERCE LOOKING ELDERLY MAN STRODE OUT FROM THE GATE WITH A
HUNTING CROP SWINGING IN HIS HAND
WHAT'S THIS DAWSON HE CRIED
NO GOSSIPING GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS
AND YOU WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU WANT HERE
TEN MINUTES' TALK WITH YOU MY GOOD SIR SAID HOLMES IN THE SWEETEST
OF VOICES
I'VE NO TIME TO TALK TO EVERY GADABOUT
WE WANT NO STRANGER HERE
BE
OFF OR YOU MAY FIND A DOG AT YOUR HEELS
HOLMES LEANED FORWARD AND WHISPERED SOMETHING IN THE TRAINER'S EAR
HE
STARTED VIOLENTLY AND FLUSHED TO THE TEMPLES
IT'S A LIE HE SHOUTED AN INFERNAL LIE
VERY GOOD
SHALL WE ARGUE ABOUT IT HERE IN PUBLIC OR TALK IT OVER IN
YOUR PARLOR
OH COME IN IF YOU WISH TO
HOLMES SMILED
I SHALL NOT KEEP YOU MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES WATSON
SAID HE
NOW MR
BROWN I AM QUITE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
IT WAS TWENTY MINUTES AND THE REDS HAD ALL FADED INTO GRAYS BEFORE
HOLMES AND THE TRAINER REAPPEARED
NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH A CHANGE AS
HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT IN SILAS BROWN IN THAT SHORT TIME
HIS FACE WAS
ASHY PALE BEADS OF PERSPIRATION SHONE UPON HIS BROW AND HIS HANDS
SHOOK UNTIL THE HUNTING CROP WAGGED LIKE A BRANCH IN THE WIND
HIS
BULLYING OVERBEARING MANNER WAS ALL GONE TOO AND HE CRINGED ALONG AT
MY COMPANION'S SIDE LIKE A DOG WITH ITS MASTER
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE DONE
IT SHALL ALL BE DONE SAID HE
THERE MUST BE NO MISTAKE SAID HOLMES LOOKING ROUND AT HIM
THE OTHER
WINCED AS HE READ THE MENACE IN HIS EYES
OH NO THERE SHALL BE NO MISTAKE
IT SHALL BE THERE
SHOULD I CHANGE IT
FIRST OR NOT
HOLMES THOUGHT A LITTLE AND THEN BURST OUT LAUGHING
NO DON'T SAID
HE I SHALL WRITE TO YOU ABOUT IT
NO TRICKS NOW OR
OH YOU CAN TRUST ME YOU CAN TRUST ME
YES I THINK I CAN
WELL YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME TO MORROW HE TURNED
UPON HIS HEEL DISREGARDING THE TREMBLING HAND WHICH THE OTHER HELD OUT
TO HIM AND WE SET OFF FOR KING'S PYLAND
A MORE PERFECT COMPOUND OF THE BULLY COWARD AND SNEAK THAN MASTER
SILAS BROWN I HAVE SELDOM MET WITH REMARKED HOLMES AS WE TRUDGED ALONG
TOGETHER
HE HAS THE HORSE THEN
HE TRIED TO BLUSTER OUT OF IT BUT I DESCRIBED TO HIM SO EXACTLY WHAT
HIS ACTIONS HAD BEEN UPON THAT MORNING THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT I WAS
WATCHING HIM
OF COURSE YOU OBSERVED THE PECULIARLY SQUARE TOES IN THE
IMPRESSIONS AND THAT HIS OWN BOOTS EXACTLY CORRESPONDED TO THEM
AGAIN OF COURSE NO SUBORDINATE WOULD HAVE DARED TO DO SUCH A THING
I DESCRIBED TO HIM HOW WHEN ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM HE WAS THE FIRST
DOWN HE PERCEIVED A STRANGE HORSE WANDERING OVER THE MOOR
HOW HE WENT
OUT TO IT AND HIS ASTONISHMENT AT RECOGNIZING FROM THE WHITE FOREHEAD
WHICH HAS GIVEN THE FAVORITE ITS NAME THAT CHANCE HAD PUT IN HIS POWER
THE ONLY HORSE WHICH COULD BEAT THE ONE UPON WHICH HE HAD PUT HIS MONEY
THEN I DESCRIBED HOW HIS FIRST IMPULSE HAD BEEN TO LEAD HIM BACK TO
KING'S PYLAND AND HOW THE DEVIL HAD SHOWN HIM HOW HE COULD HIDE THE
HORSE UNTIL THE RACE WAS OVER AND HOW HE HAD LED IT BACK AND CONCEALED
IT AT MAPLETON
WHEN I TOLD HIM EVERY DETAIL HE GAVE IT UP AND THOUGHT
ONLY OF SAVING HIS OWN SKIN
BUT HIS STABLES HAD BEEN SEARCHED
OH AN OLD HORSE FAKER LIKE HIM HAS MANY A DODGE
BUT ARE YOU NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE THE HORSE IN HIS POWER NOW SINCE HE
HAS EVERY INTEREST IN INJURING IT
MY DEAR FELLOW HE WILL GUARD IT AS THE APPLE OF HIS EYE
HE KNOWS THAT
HIS ONLY HOPE OF MERCY IS TO PRODUCE IT SAFE
COLONEL ROSS DID NOT IMPRESS ME AS A MAN WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO SHOW
MUCH MERCY IN ANY CASE
THE MATTER DOES NOT REST WITH COLONEL ROSS
I FOLLOW MY OWN METHODS
AND TELL AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS I CHOOSE
THAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF
BEING UNOFFICIAL
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU OBSERVED IT WATSON BUT THE
COLONEL'S MANNER HAS BEEN JUST A TRIFLE CAVALIER TO ME
I AM INCLINED
NOW TO HAVE A LITTLE AMUSEMENT AT HIS EXPENSE
SAY NOTHING TO HIM ABOUT
THE HORSE
CERTAINLY NOT WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION
AND OF COURSE THIS IS ALL QUITE A MINOR POINT COMPARED TO THE QUESTION
OF WHO KILLED JOHN STRAKER
AND YOU WILL DEVOTE YOURSELF TO THAT
ON THE CONTRARY WE BOTH GO BACK TO LONDON BY THE NIGHT TRAIN
I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK BY MY FRIEND'S WORDS
WE HAD ONLY BEEN A FEW HOURS
IN DEVONSHIRE AND THAT HE SHOULD GIVE UP AN INVESTIGATION WHICH HE HAD
BEGUN SO BRILLIANTLY WAS QUITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME
NOT A WORD MORE
COULD I DRAW FROM HIM UNTIL WE WERE BACK AT THE TRAINER'S HOUSE
THE
COLONEL AND THE INSPECTOR WERE AWAITING US IN THE PARLOR
MY FRIEND AND I RETURN TO TOWN BY THE NIGHT EXPRESS SAID HOLMES
WE
HAVE HAD A CHARMING LITTLE BREATH OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL DARTMOOR AIR
THE INSPECTOR OPENED HIS EYES AND THE COLONEL'S LIP CURLED IN A SNEER
SO YOU DESPAIR OF ARRESTING THE MURDERER OF POOR STRAKER SAID HE
HOLMES SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
THERE ARE CERTAINLY GRAVE DIFFICULTIES
IN THE WAY SAID HE
I HAVE EVERY HOPE HOWEVER THAT YOUR HORSE
WILL START UPON TUESDAY AND I BEG THAT YOU WILL HAVE YOUR JOCKEY IN
READINESS
MIGHT I ASK FOR A PHOTOGRAPH OF MR
JOHN STRAKER
THE INSPECTOR TOOK ONE FROM AN ENVELOPE AND HANDED IT TO HIM
MY DEAR GREGORY YOU ANTICIPATE ALL MY WANTS
IF I MIGHT ASK YOU TO
WAIT HERE FOR AN INSTANT I HAVE A QUESTION WHICH I SHOULD LIKE TO PUT
TO THE MAID
I MUST SAY THAT I AM RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN OUR LONDON CONSULTANT
SAID COLONEL ROSS BLUNTLY AS MY FRIEND LEFT THE ROOM
I DO NOT SEE
THAT WE ARE ANY FURTHER THAN WHEN HE CAME
AT LEAST YOU HAVE HIS ASSURANCE THAT YOUR HORSE WILL RUN SAID I
YES I HAVE HIS ASSURANCE SAID THE COLONEL WITH A SHRUG OF HIS
SHOULDERS
I SHOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE HORSE
I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME REPLY IN DEFENCE OF MY FRIEND WHEN HE ENTERED
THE ROOM AGAIN
NOW GENTLEMEN SAID HE I AM QUITE READY FOR TAVISTOCK
AS WE STEPPED INTO THE CARRIAGE ONE OF THE STABLE LADS HELD THE DOOR
OPEN FOR US
A SUDDEN IDEA SEEMED TO OCCUR TO HOLMES FOR HE LEANED
FORWARD AND TOUCHED THE LAD UPON THE SLEEVE
YOU HAVE A FEW SHEEP IN THE PADDOCK HE SAID
WHO ATTENDS TO THEM
I DO SIR
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING AMISS WITH THEM OF LATE
WELL SIR NOT OF MUCH ACCOUNT BUT THREE OF THEM HAVE GONE LAME SIR
I COULD SEE THAT HOLMES WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED FOR HE CHUCKLED AND
RUBBED HIS HANDS TOGETHER
A LONG SHOT WATSON A VERY LONG SHOT SAID HE PINCHING MY ARM
GREGORY LET ME RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTION THIS SINGULAR EPIDEMIC
AMONG THE SHEEP
DRIVE ON COACHMAN
COLONEL ROSS STILL WORE AN EXPRESSION WHICH SHOWED THE POOR OPINION
WHICH HE HAD FORMED OF MY COMPANION'S ABILITY BUT I SAW BY THE
INSPECTOR'S FACE THAT HIS ATTENTION HAD BEEN KEENLY AROUSED
YOU CONSIDER THAT TO BE IMPORTANT HE ASKED
EXCEEDINGLY SO
IS THERE ANY POINT TO WHICH YOU WOULD WISH TO DRAW MY ATTENTION
TO THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT TIME
THE DOG DID NOTHING IN THE NIGHT TIME
THAT WAS THE CURIOUS INCIDENT REMARKED SHERLOCK HOLMES
FOUR DAYS LATER HOLMES AND I WERE AGAIN IN THE TRAIN BOUND FOR
WINCHESTER TO SEE THE RACE FOR THE WESSEX CUP
COLONEL ROSS MET US BY
APPOINTMENT OUTSIDE THE STATION AND WE DROVE IN HIS DRAG TO THE COURSE
BEYOND THE TOWN
HIS FACE WAS GRAVE AND HIS MANNER WAS COLD IN THE
EXTREME
I HAVE SEEN NOTHING OF MY HORSE SAID HE
I SUPPOSE THAT YOU WOULD KNOW HIM WHEN YOU SAW HIM ASKED HOLMES
THE COLONEL WAS VERY ANGRY
I HAVE BEEN ON THE TURF FOR TWENTY YEARS
AND NEVER WAS ASKED SUCH A QUESTION AS THAT BEFORE SAID HE
A
CHILD WOULD KNOW SILVER BLAZE WITH HIS WHITE FOREHEAD AND HIS MOTTLED
OFF FORELEG
HOW IS THE BETTING
WELL THAT IS THE CURIOUS PART OF IT
YOU COULD HAVE GOT FIFTEEN TO ONE
YESTERDAY BUT THE PRICE HAS BECOME SHORTER AND SHORTER UNTIL YOU CAN
HARDLY GET THREE TO ONE NOW
HUM SAID HOLMES
SOMEBODY KNOWS SOMETHING THAT IS CLEAR
AS THE DRAG DREW UP IN THE ENCLOSURE NEAR THE GRAND STAND I GLANCED AT
THE CARD TO SEE THE ENTRIES
WESSEX PLATE IT RAN 50 SOVS EACH H FT WITH 1000 SOVS ADDED FOR FOUR
AND FIVE YEAR OLDS
SECOND L300
THIRD L200

ALL SIX THERE THEN MY HORSE IS RUNNING CRIED THE COLONEL IN GREAT
AGITATION
BUT I DON'T SEE HIM
MY COLORS HAVE NOT PASSED
ONLY FIVE HAVE PASSED
THIS MUST BE HE
AS I SPOKE A POWERFUL BAY HORSE SWEPT OUT FROM THE WEIGHING ENCLOSURE
AND CANTERED PAST US BEARING ON ITS BACK THE WELL KNOWN BLACK AND RED
OF THE COLONEL
THAT'S NOT MY HORSE CRIED THE OWNER
THAT BEAST HAS NOT A WHITE HAIR
UPON ITS BODY
WHAT IS THIS THAT YOU HAVE DONE MR
HOLMES
WELL WELL LET US SEE HOW HE GETS ON SAID MY FRIEND IMPERTURBABLY
FOR A FEW MINUTES HE GAZED THROUGH MY FIELD GLASS
CAPITAL AN
EXCELLENT START HE CRIED SUDDENLY
THERE THEY ARE COMING ROUND THE
CURVE
FROM OUR DRAG WE HAD A SUPERB VIEW AS THEY CAME UP THE STRAIGHT
THE SIX
HORSES WERE SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT A CARPET COULD HAVE COVERED THEM
BUT HALF WAY UP THE YELLOW OF THE MAPLETON STABLE SHOWED TO THE FRONT
BEFORE THEY REACHED US HOWEVER DESBOROUGH'S BOLT WAS SHOT AND THE
COLONEL'S HORSE COMING AWAY WITH A RUSH PASSED THE POST A GOOD SIX
LENGTHS BEFORE ITS RIVAL THE DUKE OF BALMORAL'S IRIS MAKING A BAD
THIRD
IT'S MY RACE ANYHOW GASPED THE COLONEL PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS
EYES
I CONFESS THAT I CAN MAKE NEITHER HEAD NOR TAIL OF IT
DON'T YOU
THINK THAT YOU HAVE KEPT UP YOUR MYSTERY LONG ENOUGH MR
HOLMES
CERTAINLY COLONEL YOU SHALL KNOW EVERYTHING
LET US ALL GO ROUND AND
HAVE A LOOK AT THE HORSE TOGETHER
HERE HE IS HE CONTINUED AS WE MADE
OUR WAY INTO THE WEIGHING ENCLOSURE WHERE ONLY OWNERS AND THEIR FRIENDS
FIND ADMITTANCE
YOU HAVE ONLY TO WASH HIS FACE AND HIS LEG IN SPIRITS
OF WINE AND YOU WILL FIND THAT HE IS THE SAME OLD SILVER BLAZE AS
EVER
YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY
I FOUND HIM IN THE HANDS OF A FAKER AND TOOK THE LIBERTY OF RUNNING
HIM JUST AS HE WAS SENT OVER
MY DEAR SIR YOU HAVE DONE WONDERS
THE HORSE LOOKS VERY FIT AND WELL
IT NEVER WENT BETTER IN ITS LIFE
I OWE YOU A THOUSAND APOLOGIES
FOR HAVING DOUBTED YOUR ABILITY
YOU HAVE DONE ME A GREAT SERVICE BY
RECOVERING MY HORSE
YOU WOULD DO ME A GREATER STILL IF YOU COULD LAY
YOUR HANDS ON THE MURDERER OF JOHN STRAKER
I HAVE DONE SO SAID HOLMES QUIETLY
THE COLONEL AND I STARED AT HIM IN AMAZEMENT
YOU HAVE GOT HIM WHERE
IS HE THEN
HE IS HERE
HERE WHERE
IN MY COMPANY AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
THE COLONEL FLUSHED ANGRILY
I QUITE RECOGNIZE THAT I AM UNDER
OBLIGATIONS TO YOU MR
HOLMES SAID HE BUT I MUST REGARD WHAT YOU
HAVE JUST SAID AS EITHER A VERY BAD JOKE OR AN INSULT
SHERLOCK HOLMES LAUGHED
I ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE NOT ASSOCIATED
YOU WITH THE CRIME COLONEL SAID HE
THE REAL MURDERER IS STANDING
IMMEDIATELY BEHIND YOU HE STEPPED PAST AND LAID HIS HAND UPON THE
GLOSSY NECK OF THE THOROUGHBRED
THE HORSE CRIED BOTH THE COLONEL AND MYSELF
YES THE HORSE
AND IT MAY LESSEN HIS GUILT IF I SAY THAT IT WAS
DONE IN SELF DEFENCE AND THAT JOHN STRAKER WAS A MAN WHO WAS ENTIRELY
UNWORTHY OF YOUR CONFIDENCE
BUT THERE GOES THE BELL AND AS I STAND
TO WIN A LITTLE ON THIS NEXT RACE I SHALL DEFER A LENGTHY EXPLANATION
UNTIL A MORE FITTING TIME
WE HAD THE CORNER OF A PULLMAN CAR TO OURSELVES THAT EVENING AS WE
WHIRLED BACK TO LONDON AND I FANCY THAT THE JOURNEY WAS A SHORT ONE
TO COLONEL ROSS AS WELL AS TO MYSELF AS WE LISTENED TO OUR
COMPANION'S NARRATIVE OF THE EVENTS WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THE DARTMOOR
TRAINING STABLES UPON THE MONDAY NIGHT AND THE MEANS BY WHICH HE HAD
UNRAVELLED THEM
I CONFESS SAID HE THAT ANY THEORIES WHICH I HAD FORMED FROM
THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS WERE ENTIRELY ERRONEOUS
AND YET THERE WERE
INDICATIONS THERE HAD THEY NOT BEEN OVERLAID BY OTHER DETAILS WHICH
CONCEALED THEIR TRUE IMPORT
I WENT TO DEVONSHIRE WITH THE CONVICTION
THAT FITZROY SIMPSON WAS THE TRUE CULPRIT ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I SAW
THAT THE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM WAS BY NO MEANS COMPLETE
IT WAS WHILE I
WAS IN THE CARRIAGE JUST AS WE REACHED THE TRAINER'S HOUSE THAT THE
IMMENSE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CURRIED MUTTON OCCURRED TO ME
YOU MAY
REMEMBER THAT I WAS DISTRAIT AND REMAINED SITTING AFTER YOU HAD ALL
ALIGHTED
I WAS MARVELLING IN MY OWN MIND HOW I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE
OVERLOOKED SO OBVIOUS A CLUE
I CONFESS SAID THE COLONEL THAT EVEN NOW I CANNOT SEE HOW IT HELPS
US
IT WAS THE FIRST LINK IN MY CHAIN OF REASONING
POWDERED OPIUM IS BY NO
MEANS TASTELESS
THE FLAVOR IS NOT DISAGREEABLE BUT IT IS PERCEPTIBLE
WERE IT MIXED WITH ANY ORDINARY DISH THE EATER WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY DETECT
IT AND WOULD PROBABLY EAT NO MORE
A CURRY WAS EXACTLY THE MEDIUM
WHICH WOULD DISGUISE THIS TASTE
BY NO POSSIBLE SUPPOSITION COULD
THIS STRANGER FITZROY SIMPSON HAVE CAUSED CURRY TO BE SERVED IN
THE TRAINER'S FAMILY THAT NIGHT AND IT IS SURELY TOO MONSTROUS A
COINCIDENCE TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HAPPENED TO COME ALONG WITH POWDERED
OPIUM UPON THE VERY NIGHT WHEN A DISH HAPPENED TO BE SERVED WHICH WOULD
DISGUISE THE FLAVOR
THAT IS UNTHINKABLE
THEREFORE SIMPSON BECOMES
ELIMINATED FROM THE CASE AND OUR ATTENTION CENTERS UPON STRAKER AND
HIS WIFE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE CHOSEN CURRIED MUTTON FOR
SUPPER THAT NIGHT
THE OPIUM WAS ADDED AFTER THE DISH WAS SET ASIDE
FOR THE STABLE BOY FOR THE OTHERS HAD THE SAME FOR SUPPER WITH NO ILL
EFFECTS
WHICH OF THEM THEN HAD ACCESS TO THAT DISH WITHOUT THE MAID
SEEING THEM
BEFORE DECIDING THAT QUESTION I HAD GRASPED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
SILENCE OF THE DOG FOR ONE TRUE INFERENCE INVARIABLY SUGGESTS OTHERS
THE SIMPSON INCIDENT HAD SHOWN ME THAT A DOG WAS KEPT IN THE STABLES
AND YET THOUGH SOME ONE HAD BEEN IN AND HAD FETCHED OUT A HORSE HE
HAD NOT BARKED ENOUGH TO AROUSE THE TWO LADS IN THE LOFT
OBVIOUSLY THE
MIDNIGHT VISITOR WAS SOME ONE WHOM THE DOG KNEW WELL
I WAS ALREADY CONVINCED OR ALMOST CONVINCED THAT JOHN STRAKER WENT
DOWN TO THE STABLES IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND TOOK OUT SILVER BLAZE
FOR WHAT PURPOSE FOR A DISHONEST ONE OBVIOUSLY OR WHY SHOULD HE DRUG
HIS OWN STABLE BOY AND YET I WAS AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHY
THERE HAVE BEEN
CASES BEFORE NOW WHERE TRAINERS HAVE MADE SURE OF GREAT SUMS OF MONEY
BY LAYING AGAINST THEIR OWN HORSES THROUGH AGENTS AND THEN PREVENTING
THEM FROM WINNING BY FRAUD
SOMETIMES IT IS A PULLING JOCKEY
SOMETIMES
IT IS SOME SURER AND SUBTLER MEANS
WHAT WAS IT HERE I HOPED THAT THE
CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS MIGHT HELP ME TO FORM A CONCLUSION
AND THEY DID SO
YOU CANNOT HAVE FORGOTTEN THE SINGULAR KNIFE WHICH WAS
FOUND IN THE DEAD MAN'S HAND A KNIFE WHICH CERTAINLY NO SANE MAN WOULD
CHOOSE FOR A WEAPON
IT WAS AS DR
WATSON TOLD US A FORM OF KNIFE
WHICH IS USED FOR THE MOST DELICATE OPERATIONS KNOWN IN SURGERY
AND IT
WAS TO BE USED FOR A DELICATE OPERATION THAT NIGHT
YOU MUST KNOW WITH
YOUR WIDE EXPERIENCE OF TURF MATTERS COLONEL ROSS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE
TO MAKE A SLIGHT NICK UPON THE TENDONS OF A HORSE'S HAM AND TO DO IT
SUBCUTANEOUSLY SO AS TO LEAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE
A HORSE SO TREATED
WOULD DEVELOP A SLIGHT LAMENESS WHICH WOULD BE PUT DOWN TO A STRAIN IN
EXERCISE OR A TOUCH OF RHEUMATISM BUT NEVER TO FOUL PLAY
VILLAIN SCOUNDREL CRIED THE COLONEL
WE HAVE HERE THE EXPLANATION OF WHY JOHN STRAKER WISHED TO TAKE THE
HORSE OUT ON TO THE MOOR
SO SPIRITED A CREATURE WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY
ROUSED THE SOUNDEST OF SLEEPERS WHEN IT FELT THE PRICK OF THE KNIFE
IT
WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO IT IN THE OPEN AIR
I HAVE BEEN BLIND CRIED THE COLONEL
OF COURSE THAT WAS WHY HE
NEEDED THE CANDLE AND STRUCK THE MATCH
UNDOUBTEDLY
BUT IN EXAMINING HIS BELONGINGS I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO
DISCOVER NOT ONLY THE METHOD OF THE CRIME BUT EVEN ITS MOTIVES
AS A
MAN OF THE WORLD COLONEL YOU KNOW THAT MEN DO NOT CARRY OTHER PEOPLE'S
BILLS ABOUT IN THEIR POCKETS
WE HAVE MOST OF US QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO
SETTLE OUR OWN
I AT ONCE CONCLUDED THAT STRAKER WAS LEADING A DOUBLE
LIFE AND KEEPING A SECOND ESTABLISHMENT
THE NATURE OF THE BILL SHOWED
THAT THERE WAS A LADY IN THE CASE AND ONE WHO HAD EXPENSIVE TASTES
LIBERAL AS YOU ARE WITH YOUR SERVANTS ONE CAN HARDLY EXPECT THAT THEY
CAN BUY TWENTY GUINEA WALKING DRESSES FOR THEIR LADIES
I QUESTIONED
MRS
STRAKER AS TO THE DRESS WITHOUT HER KNOWING IT AND HAVING
SATISFIED MYSELF THAT IT HAD NEVER REACHED HER I MADE A NOTE OF THE
MILLINER'S ADDRESS AND FELT THAT BY CALLING THERE WITH STRAKER'S
PHOTOGRAPH I COULD EASILY DISPOSE OF THE MYTHICAL DERBYSHIRE
FROM THAT TIME ON ALL WAS PLAIN
STRAKER HAD LED OUT THE HORSE TO A
HOLLOW WHERE HIS LIGHT WOULD BE INVISIBLE
SIMPSON IN HIS FLIGHT HAD
DROPPED HIS CRAVAT AND STRAKER HAD PICKED IT UP WITH SOME IDEA
PERHAPS THAT HE MIGHT USE IT IN SECURING THE HORSE'S LEG
ONCE IN THE
HOLLOW HE HAD GOT BEHIND THE HORSE AND HAD STRUCK A LIGHT BUT THE
CREATURE FRIGHTENED AT THE SUDDEN GLARE AND WITH THE STRANGE INSTINCT
OF ANIMALS FEELING THAT SOME MISCHIEF WAS INTENDED HAD LASHED OUT AND
THE STEEL SHOE HAD STRUCK STRAKER FULL ON THE FOREHEAD
HE HAD ALREADY
IN SPITE OF THE RAIN TAKEN OFF HIS OVERCOAT IN ORDER TO DO HIS DELICATE
TASK AND SO AS HE FELL HIS KNIFE GASHED HIS THIGH
DO I MAKE IT
CLEAR
WONDERFUL CRIED THE COLONEL
WONDERFUL YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN THERE
MY FINAL SHOT WAS I CONFESS A VERY LONG ONE
IT STRUCK ME THAT SO
ASTUTE A MAN AS STRAKER WOULD NOT UNDERTAKE THIS DELICATE TENDON NICKING
WITHOUT A LITTLE PRACTICE
WHAT COULD HE PRACTICE ON MY EYES FELL UPON
THE SHEEP AND I ASKED A QUESTION WHICH RATHER TO MY SURPRISE SHOWED
THAT MY SURMISE WAS CORRECT
WHEN I RETURNED TO LONDON I CALLED UPON THE MILLINER WHO HAD
RECOGNIZED STRAKER AS AN EXCELLENT CUSTOMER OF THE NAME OF DERBYSHIRE
WHO HAD A VERY DASHING WIFE WITH A STRONG PARTIALITY FOR EXPENSIVE
DRESSES
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS WOMAN HAD PLUNGED HIM OVER HEAD AND
EARS IN DEBT AND SO LED HIM INTO THIS MISERABLE PLOT
YOU HAVE EXPLAINED ALL BUT ONE THING CRIED THE COLONEL
WHERE WAS
THE HORSE
AH IT BOLTED AND WAS CARED FOR BY ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS
WE MUST HAVE
AN AMNESTY IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK
THIS IS CLAPHAM JUNCTION IF I AM
NOT MISTAKEN AND WE SHALL BE IN VICTORIA IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES
IF
YOU CARE TO SMOKE A CIGAR IN OUR ROOMS COLONEL I SHALL BE HAPPY TO
GIVE YOU ANY OTHER DETAILS WHICH MIGHT INTEREST YOU
ADVENTURE II
THE YELLOW FACE
IN PUBLISHING THESE SHORT SKETCHES BASED UPON THE NUMEROUS CASES IN
WHICH MY COMPANION'S SINGULAR GIFTS HAVE MADE US THE LISTENERS TO AND
EVENTUALLY THE ACTORS IN SOME STRANGE DRAMA IT IS ONLY NATURAL THAT I
SHOULD DWELL RATHER UPON HIS SUCCESSES THAN UPON HIS FAILURES
AND THIS
NOT SO MUCH FOR THE SAKE OF HIS REPUTATION FOR INDEED IT WAS WHEN
HE WAS AT HIS WITS' END THAT HIS ENERGY AND HIS VERSATILITY WERE MOST
ADMIRABLE BUT BECAUSE WHERE HE FAILED IT HAPPENED TOO OFTEN THAT NO ONE
ELSE SUCCEEDED AND THAT THE TALE WAS LEFT FOREVER WITHOUT A CONCLUSION
NOW AND AGAIN HOWEVER IT CHANCED THAT EVEN WHEN HE ERRED THE TRUTH
WAS STILL DISCOVERED
I HAVE NOTED OF SOME HALF DOZEN CASES OF THE
KIND THE ADVENTURE OF THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL AND THAT WHICH I AM ABOUT TO
RECOUNT ARE THE TWO WHICH PRESENT THE STRONGEST FEATURES OF INTEREST
SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS A MAN WHO SELDOM TOOK EXERCISE FOR EXERCISE'S SAKE
FEW MEN WERE CAPABLE OF GREATER MUSCULAR EFFORT AND HE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY
ONE OF THE FINEST BOXERS OF HIS WEIGHT THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN BUT HE
LOOKED UPON AIMLESS BODILY EXERTION AS A WASTE OF ENERGY AND HE SELDOM
BESTIRRED HIMSELF SAVE WHEN THERE WAS SOME PROFESSIONAL OBJECT TO BE
SERVED
THEN HE WAS ABSOLUTELY UNTIRING AND INDEFATIGABLE
THAT HE
SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIMSELF IN TRAINING UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES IS
REMARKABLE BUT HIS DIET WAS USUALLY OF THE SPAREST AND HIS HABITS
WERE SIMPLE TO THE VERGE OF AUSTERITY
SAVE FOR THE OCCASIONAL USE OF
COCAINE HE HAD NO VICES AND HE ONLY TURNED TO THE DRUG AS A PROTEST
AGAINST THE MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE WHEN CASES WERE SCANTY AND THE PAPERS
UNINTERESTING
ONE DAY IN EARLY SPRING HE HAD SO FAR RELAXED AS TO GO FOR A WALK WITH
ME IN THE PARK WHERE THE FIRST FAINT SHOOTS OF GREEN WERE BREAKING OUT
UPON THE ELMS AND THE STICKY SPEAR HEADS OF THE CHESTNUTS WERE JUST
BEGINNING TO BURST INTO THEIR FIVE FOLD LEAVES
FOR TWO HOURS WE RAMBLED
ABOUT TOGETHER IN SILENCE FOR THE MOST PART AS BEFITS TWO MEN WHO KNOW
EACH OTHER INTIMATELY
IT WAS NEARLY FIVE BEFORE WE WERE BACK IN BAKER
STREET ONCE MORE
BEG PARDON SIR SAID OUR PAGE BOY AS HE OPENED THE DOOR
THERE'S
BEEN A GENTLEMAN HERE ASKING FOR YOU SIR
HOLMES GLANCED REPROACHFULLY AT ME
SO MUCH FOR AFTERNOON WALKS SAID
HE
HAS THIS GENTLEMAN GONE THEN
YES SIR
DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM IN
YES SIR HE CAME IN
HOW LONG DID HE WAIT
HALF AN HOUR SIR
HE WAS A VERY RESTLESS GENTLEMAN SIR A WALKIN'
AND A STAMPIN' ALL THE TIME HE WAS HERE
I WAS WAITIN' OUTSIDE THE DOOR
SIR AND I COULD HEAR HIM
AT LAST HE OUTS INTO THE PASSAGE AND HE
CRIES 'IS THAT MAN NEVER GOIN' TO COME THOSE WERE HIS VERY WORDS
SIR
'YOU'LL ONLY NEED TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER SAYS I
'THEN I'LL WAIT
IN THE OPEN AIR FOR I FEEL HALF CHOKED SAYS HE
'I'LL BE BACK BEFORE
LONG AND WITH THAT HE UPS AND HE OUTS AND ALL I COULD SAY WOULDN'T
HOLD HIM BACK
WELL WELL YOU DID YOUR BEST SAID HOLMES AS WE WALKED INTO OUR
ROOM
IT'S VERY ANNOYING THOUGH WATSON
I WAS BADLY IN NEED OF
A CASE AND THIS LOOKS FROM THE MAN'S IMPATIENCE AS IF IT WERE OF
IMPORTANCE
HULLO THAT'S NOT YOUR PIPE ON THE TABLE
HE MUST HAVE
LEFT HIS BEHIND HIM
A NICE OLD BRIER WITH A GOOD LONG STEM OF WHAT THE
TOBACCONISTS CALL AMBER
I WONDER HOW MANY REAL AMBER MOUTHPIECES THERE
ARE IN LONDON SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT A FLY IN IT IS A SIGN
WELL HE
MUST HAVE BEEN DISTURBED IN HIS MIND TO LEAVE A PIPE BEHIND HIM WHICH HE
EVIDENTLY VALUES HIGHLY
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT HE VALUES IT HIGHLY I ASKED
WELL I SHOULD PUT THE ORIGINAL COST OF THE PIPE AT SEVEN AND SIXPENCE
NOW IT HAS YOU SEE BEEN TWICE MENDED ONCE IN THE WOODEN STEM AND ONCE
IN THE AMBER
EACH OF THESE MENDS DONE AS YOU OBSERVE WITH SILVER
BANDS MUST HAVE COST MORE THAN THE PIPE DID ORIGINALLY
THE MAN MUST
VALUE THE PIPE HIGHLY WHEN HE PREFERS TO PATCH IT UP RATHER THAN BUY A
NEW ONE WITH THE SAME MONEY
ANYTHING ELSE I ASKED FOR HOLMES WAS TURNING THE PIPE ABOUT IN HIS
HAND AND STARING AT IT IN HIS PECULIAR PENSIVE WAY
HE HELD IT UP AND TAPPED ON IT WITH HIS LONG THIN FORE FINGER AS A
PROFESSOR MIGHT WHO WAS LECTURING ON A BONE
PIPES ARE OCCASIONALLY OF EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST SAID HE
NOTHING
HAS MORE INDIVIDUALITY SAVE PERHAPS WATCHES AND BOOTLACES
THE
INDICATIONS HERE HOWEVER ARE NEITHER VERY MARKED NOR VERY IMPORTANT
THE OWNER IS OBVIOUSLY A MUSCULAR MAN LEFT HANDED WITH AN EXCELLENT
SET OF TEETH CARELESS IN HIS HABITS AND WITH NO NEED TO PRACTISE
ECONOMY
MY FRIEND THREW OUT THE INFORMATION IN A VERY OFFHAND WAY BUT I SAW
THAT HE COCKED HIS EYE AT ME TO SEE IF I HAD FOLLOWED HIS REASONING
YOU THINK A MAN MUST BE WELL TO DO IF HE SMOKES A SEVEN SHILLING PIPE
SAID I
THIS IS GROSVENOR MIXTURE AT EIGHTPENCE AN OUNCE HOLMES ANSWERED
KNOCKING A LITTLE OUT ON HIS PALM
AS HE MIGHT GET AN EXCELLENT SMOKE
FOR HALF THE PRICE HE HAS NO NEED TO PRACTISE ECONOMY
AND THE OTHER POINTS
HE HAS BEEN IN THE HABIT OF LIGHTING HIS PIPE AT LAMPS AND GAS JETS
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS QUITE CHARRED ALL DOWN ONE SIDE
OF COURSE A
MATCH COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT
WHY SHOULD A MAN HOLD A MATCH TO THE
SIDE OF HIS PIPE BUT YOU CANNOT LIGHT IT AT A LAMP WITHOUT GETTING THE
BOWL CHARRED
AND IT IS ALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PIPE
FROM THAT I
GATHER THAT HE IS A LEFT HANDED MAN
YOU HOLD YOUR OWN PIPE TO THE LAMP
AND SEE HOW NATURALLY YOU BEING RIGHT HANDED HOLD THE LEFT SIDE TO THE
FLAME
YOU MIGHT DO IT ONCE THE OTHER WAY BUT NOT AS A CONSTANCY
THIS
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HELD SO
THEN HE HAS BITTEN THROUGH HIS AMBER
IT TAKES
A MUSCULAR ENERGETIC FELLOW AND ONE WITH A GOOD SET OF TEETH TO DO
THAT
BUT IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN I HEAR HIM UPON THE STAIR SO WE SHALL
HAVE SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING THAN HIS PIPE TO STUDY
AN INSTANT LATER OUR DOOR OPENED AND A TALL YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE ROOM
HE WAS WELL BUT QUIETLY DRESSED IN A DARK GRAY SUIT AND CARRIED A BROWN
WIDE AWAKE IN HIS HAND
I SHOULD HAVE PUT HIM AT ABOUT THIRTY THOUGH HE
WAS REALLY SOME YEARS OLDER
I BEG YOUR PARDON SAID HE WITH SOME EMBARRASSMENT I SUPPOSE I
SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED
YES OF COURSE I SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED
THE FACT
IS THAT I AM A LITTLE UPSET AND YOU MUST PUT IT ALL DOWN TO THAT HE
PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN WHO IS HALF DAZED AND THEN
FELL RATHER THAN SAT DOWN UPON A CHAIR
I CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE NOT SLEPT FOR A NIGHT OR TWO SAID HOLMES
IN HIS EASY GENIAL WAY
THAT TRIES A MAN'S NERVES MORE THAN WORK AND
MORE EVEN THAN PLEASURE
MAY I ASK HOW I CAN HELP YOU
I WANTED YOUR ADVICE SIR
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND MY WHOLE LIFE
SEEMS TO HAVE GONE TO PIECES
YOU WISH TO EMPLOY ME AS A CONSULTING DETECTIVE
NOT THAT ONLY
I WANT YOUR OPINION AS A JUDICIOUS MAN AS A MAN OF THE
WORLD
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO DO NEXT
I HOPE TO GOD YOU'LL BE
ABLE TO TELL ME
HE SPOKE IN LITTLE SHARP JERKY OUTBURSTS AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO
SPEAK AT ALL WAS VERY PAINFUL TO HIM AND THAT HIS WILL ALL THROUGH WAS
OVERRIDING HIS INCLINATIONS
IT'S A VERY DELICATE THING SAID HE
ONE DOES NOT LIKE TO SPEAK OF
ONE'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS TO STRANGERS
IT SEEMS DREADFUL TO DISCUSS THE
CONDUCT OF ONE'S WIFE WITH TWO MEN WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IT'S
HORRIBLE TO HAVE TO DO IT
BUT I'VE GOT TO THE END OF MY TETHER AND I
MUST HAVE ADVICE
MY DEAR MR
GRANT MUNRO BEGAN HOLMES
OUR VISITOR SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR
WHAT HE CRIED YOU KNOW MY NAME
IF YOU WISH TO PRESERVE YOUR INCOGNITO SAID HOLMES SMILING I WOULD
SUGGEST THAT YOU CEASE TO WRITE YOUR NAME UPON THE LINING OF YOUR
HAT OR ELSE THAT YOU TURN THE CROWN TOWARDS THE PERSON WHOM YOU ARE
ADDRESSING
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT MY FRIEND AND I HAVE LISTENED TO A
GOOD MANY STRANGE SECRETS IN THIS ROOM AND THAT WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD
FORTUNE TO BRING PEACE TO MANY TROUBLED SOULS
I TRUST THAT WE MAY DO AS
MUCH FOR YOU
MIGHT I BEG YOU AS TIME MAY PROVE TO BE OF IMPORTANCE TO
FURNISH ME WITH THE FACTS OF YOUR CASE WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY
OUR VISITOR AGAIN PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS FOREHEAD AS IF HE FOUND IT
BITTERLY HARD
FROM EVERY GESTURE AND EXPRESSION I COULD SEE THAT HE WAS
A RESERVED SELF CONTAINED MAN WITH A DASH OF PRIDE IN HIS NATURE MORE
LIKELY TO HIDE HIS WOUNDS THAN TO EXPOSE THEM
THEN SUDDENLY WITH A
FIERCE GESTURE OF HIS CLOSED HAND LIKE ONE WHO THROWS RESERVE TO THE
WINDS HE BEGAN
THE FACTS ARE THESE MR
HOLMES SAID HE
I AM A MARRIED MAN AND
HAVE BEEN SO FOR THREE YEARS
DURING THAT TIME MY WIFE AND I HAVE LOVED
EACH OTHER AS FONDLY AND LIVED AS HAPPILY AS ANY TWO THAT EVER WERE
JOINED
WE HAVE NOT HAD A DIFFERENCE NOT ONE IN THOUGHT OR WORD OR
DEED
AND NOW SINCE LAST MONDAY THERE HAS SUDDENLY SPRUNG UP A BARRIER
BETWEEN US AND I FIND THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN HER LIFE AND IN HER
THOUGHT OF WHICH I KNOW AS LITTLE AS IF SHE WERE THE WOMAN WHO BRUSHES
BY ME IN THE STREET
WE ARE ESTRANGED AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY
NOW THERE IS ONE THING THAT I WANT TO IMPRESS UPON YOU BEFORE I GO
ANY FURTHER MR
HOLMES
EFFIE LOVES ME
DON'T LET THERE BE ANY MISTAKE
ABOUT THAT
SHE LOVES ME WITH HER WHOLE HEART AND SOUL AND NEVER MORE
THAN NOW
I KNOW IT
I FEEL IT
I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE ABOUT THAT
A MAN
CAN TELL EASILY ENOUGH WHEN A WOMAN LOVES HIM
BUT THERE'S THIS SECRET
BETWEEN US AND WE CAN NEVER BE THE SAME UNTIL IT IS CLEARED
KINDLY LET ME HAVE THE FACTS MR
MUNRO SAID HOLMES WITH SOME
IMPATIENCE
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW ABOUT EFFIE'S HISTORY
SHE WAS A WIDOW WHEN
I MET HER FIRST THOUGH QUITE YOUNG ONLY TWENTY FIVE
HER NAME THEN WAS
MRS
HEBRON
SHE WENT OUT TO AMERICA WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG AND LIVED IN
THE TOWN OF ATLANTA WHERE SHE MARRIED THIS HEBRON WHO WAS A LAWYER
WITH A GOOD PRACTICE
THEY HAD ONE CHILD BUT THE YELLOW FEVER BROKE OUT
BADLY IN THE PLACE AND BOTH HUSBAND AND CHILD DIED OF IT
I HAVE SEEN
HIS DEATH CERTIFICATE
THIS SICKENED HER OF AMERICA AND SHE CAME BACK
TO LIVE WITH A MAIDEN AUNT AT PINNER IN MIDDLESEX
I MAY MENTION THAT
HER HUSBAND HAD LEFT HER COMFORTABLY OFF AND THAT SHE HAD A CAPITAL OF
ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS WHICH HAD BEEN SO WELL INVESTED
BY HIM THAT IT RETURNED AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN PER CENT
SHE HAD ONLY BEEN
SIX MONTHS AT PINNER WHEN I MET HER WE FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
AND WE MARRIED A FEW WEEKS AFTERWARDS
I AM A HOP MERCHANT MYSELF AND AS I HAVE AN INCOME OF SEVEN OR
EIGHT HUNDRED WE FOUND OURSELVES COMFORTABLY OFF AND TOOK A NICE
EIGHTY POUND A YEAR VILLA AT NORBURY
OUR LITTLE PLACE WAS VERY
COUNTRIFIED CONSIDERING THAT IT IS SO CLOSE TO TOWN
WE HAD AN INN AND
TWO HOUSES A LITTLE ABOVE US AND A SINGLE COTTAGE AT THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE FIELD WHICH FACES US AND EXCEPT THOSE THERE WERE NO HOUSES UNTIL
YOU GOT HALF WAY TO THE STATION
MY BUSINESS TOOK ME INTO TOWN AT
CERTAIN SEASONS BUT IN SUMMER I HAD LESS TO DO AND THEN IN OUR COUNTRY
HOME MY WIFE AND I WERE JUST AS HAPPY AS COULD BE WISHED
I TELL YOU
THAT THERE NEVER WAS A SHADOW BETWEEN US UNTIL THIS ACCURSED AFFAIR
BEGAN
THERE'S ONE THING I OUGHT TO TELL YOU BEFORE I GO FURTHER
WHEN WE
MARRIED MY WIFE MADE OVER ALL HER PROPERTY TO ME RATHER AGAINST MY
WILL FOR I SAW HOW AWKWARD IT WOULD BE IF MY BUSINESS AFFAIRS WENT
WRONG
HOWEVER SHE WOULD HAVE IT SO AND IT WAS DONE
WELL ABOUT SIX
WEEKS AGO SHE CAME TO ME
'JACK SAID SHE 'WHEN YOU TOOK MY MONEY YOU SAID THAT IF EVER I
WANTED ANY I WAS TO ASK YOU FOR IT
'CERTAINLY SAID I
'IT'S ALL YOUR OWN
'WELL SAID SHE 'I WANT A HUNDRED POUNDS
I WAS A BIT STAGGERED AT THIS FOR I HAD IMAGINED IT WAS SIMPLY A NEW
DRESS OR SOMETHING OF THE KIND THAT SHE WAS AFTER
'WHAT ON EARTH FOR I ASKED
'OH SAID SHE IN HER PLAYFUL WAY 'YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE ONLY MY
BANKER AND BANKERS NEVER ASK QUESTIONS YOU KNOW
'IF YOU REALLY MEAN IT OF COURSE YOU SHALL HAVE THE MONEY SAID I
'OH YES I REALLY MEAN IT
'AND YOU WON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT IT FOR
'SOME DAY PERHAPS BUT NOT JUST AT PRESENT JACK
SO I HAD TO BE CONTENT WITH THAT THOUGH IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT
THERE HAD EVER BEEN ANY SECRET BETWEEN US
I GAVE HER A CHECK AND I
NEVER THOUGHT ANY MORE OF THE MATTER
IT MAY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
WHAT CAME AFTERWARDS BUT I THOUGHT IT ONLY RIGHT TO MENTION IT
WELL I TOLD YOU JUST NOW THAT THERE IS A COTTAGE NOT FAR FROM OUR
HOUSE
THERE IS JUST A FIELD BETWEEN US BUT TO REACH IT YOU HAVE TO
GO ALONG THE ROAD AND THEN TURN DOWN A LANE
JUST BEYOND IT IS A NICE
LITTLE GROVE OF SCOTCH FIRS AND I USED TO BE VERY FOND OF STROLLING
DOWN THERE FOR TREES ARE ALWAYS A NEIGHBORLY KIND OF THINGS
THE
COTTAGE HAD BEEN STANDING EMPTY THIS EIGHT MONTHS AND IT WAS A PITY
FOR IT WAS A PRETTY TWO STORIED PLACE WITH AN OLD FASHIONED PORCH AND
HONEYSUCKLE ABOUT IT
I HAVE STOOD MANY A TIME AND THOUGHT WHAT A NEAT
LITTLE HOMESTEAD IT WOULD MAKE
WELL LAST MONDAY EVENING I WAS TAKING A STROLL DOWN THAT WAY WHEN
I MET AN EMPTY VAN COMING UP THE LANE AND SAW A PILE OF CARPETS AND
THINGS LYING ABOUT ON THE GRASS PLOT BESIDE THE PORCH
IT WAS CLEAR THAT
THE COTTAGE HAD AT LAST BEEN LET
I WALKED PAST IT AND WONDERED WHAT
SORT OF FOLK THEY WERE WHO HAD COME TO LIVE SO NEAR US
AND AS I LOOKED
I SUDDENLY BECAME AWARE THAT A FACE WAS WATCHING ME OUT OF ONE OF THE
UPPER WINDOWS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE WAS ABOUT THAT FACE MR
HOLMES BUT IT SEEMED
TO SEND A CHILL RIGHT DOWN MY BACK
I WAS SOME LITTLE WAY OFF SO THAT
I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE FEATURES BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING UNNATURAL AND
INHUMAN ABOUT THE FACE
THAT WAS THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD AND I MOVED
QUICKLY FORWARDS TO GET A NEARER VIEW OF THE PERSON WHO WAS WATCHING
ME
BUT AS I DID SO THE FACE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED SO SUDDENLY THAT IT
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN PLUCKED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE ROOM
I STOOD
FOR FIVE MINUTES THINKING THE BUSINESS OVER AND TRYING TO ANALYZE MY
IMPRESSIONS
I COULD NOT TELL IF THE FACE WERE THAT OF A MAN OR A
WOMAN
IT HAD BEEN TOO FAR FROM ME FOR THAT
BUT ITS COLOR WAS WHAT HAD
IMPRESSED ME MOST
IT WAS OF A LIVID CHALKY WHITE AND WITH SOMETHING
SET AND RIGID ABOUT IT WHICH WAS SHOCKINGLY UNNATURAL
SO DISTURBED
WAS I THAT I DETERMINED TO SEE A LITTLE MORE OF THE NEW INMATES OF
THE COTTAGE
I APPROACHED AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS INSTANTLY
OPENED BY A TALL GAUNT WOMAN WITH A HARSH FORBIDDING FACE
'WHAT MAY YOU BE WANTIN' SHE ASKED IN A NORTHERN ACCENT
'I AM YOUR NEIGHBOR OVER YONDER SAID I NODDING TOWARDS MY HOUSE
'I
SEE THAT YOU HAVE ONLY JUST MOVED IN SO I THOUGHT THAT IF I COULD BE OF
ANY HELP TO YOU IN ANY
'AY WE'LL JUST ASK YE WHEN WE WANT YE SAID SHE AND SHUT THE DOOR
IN MY FACE
ANNOYED AT THE CHURLISH REBUFF I TURNED MY BACK AND WALKED
HOME
ALL EVENING THOUGH I TRIED TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS MY MIND
WOULD STILL TURN TO THE APPARITION AT THE WINDOW AND THE RUDENESS OF THE
WOMAN
I DETERMINED TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE FORMER TO MY WIFE FOR
SHE IS A NERVOUS HIGHLY STRUNG WOMAN AND I HAD NO WISH THAT SHE WOULD
SHARE THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION WHICH HAD BEEN PRODUCED UPON MYSELF
I
REMARKED TO HER HOWEVER BEFORE I FELL ASLEEP THAT THE COTTAGE WAS NOW
OCCUPIED TO WHICH SHE RETURNED NO REPLY
I AM USUALLY AN EXTREMELY SOUND SLEEPER
IT HAS BEEN A STANDING JEST
IN THE FAMILY THAT NOTHING COULD EVER WAKE ME DURING THE NIGHT
AND YET
SOMEHOW ON THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT WHETHER IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE SLIGHT
EXCITEMENT PRODUCED BY MY LITTLE ADVENTURE OR NOT I KNOW NOT BUT
I SLEPT MUCH MORE LIGHTLY THAN USUAL
HALF IN MY DREAMS I WAS DIMLY
CONSCIOUS THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING ON IN THE ROOM AND GRADUALLY BECAME
AWARE THAT MY WIFE HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND WAS SLIPPING ON HER MANTLE
AND HER BONNET
MY LIPS WERE PARTED TO MURMUR OUT SOME SLEEPY WORDS OF
SURPRISE OR REMONSTRANCE AT THIS UNTIMELY PREPARATION WHEN SUDDENLY MY
HALF OPENED EYES FELL UPON HER FACE ILLUMINATED BY THE CANDLE LIGHT
AND ASTONISHMENT HELD ME DUMB
SHE WORE AN EXPRESSION SUCH AS I HAD
NEVER SEEN BEFORE SUCH AS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER INCAPABLE OF
ASSUMING
SHE WAS DEADLY PALE AND BREATHING FAST GLANCING FURTIVELY
TOWARDS THE BED AS SHE FASTENED HER MANTLE TO SEE IF SHE HAD DISTURBED
ME
THEN THINKING THAT I WAS STILL ASLEEP SHE SLIPPED NOISELESSLY FROM
THE ROOM AND AN INSTANT LATER I HEARD A SHARP CREAKING WHICH COULD ONLY
COME FROM THE HINGES OF THE FRONT DOOR
I SAT UP IN BED AND RAPPED MY
KNUCKLES AGAINST THE RAIL TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I WAS TRULY AWAKE
THEN
I TOOK MY WATCH FROM UNDER THE PILLOW
IT WAS THREE IN THE MORNING
WHAT
ON THIS EARTH COULD MY WIFE BE DOING OUT ON THE COUNTRY ROAD AT THREE IN
THE MORNING
I HAD SAT FOR ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES TURNING THE THING OVER IN MY MIND
AND TRYING TO FIND SOME POSSIBLE EXPLANATION
THE MORE I THOUGHT THE
MORE EXTRAORDINARY AND INEXPLICABLE DID IT APPEAR
I WAS STILL PUZZLING
OVER IT WHEN I HEARD THE DOOR GENTLY CLOSE AGAIN AND HER FOOTSTEPS
COMING UP THE STAIRS
'WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU BEEN EFFIE I ASKED AS SHE ENTERED
SHE GAVE A VIOLENT START AND A KIND OF GASPING CRY WHEN I SPOKE AND
THAT CRY AND START TROUBLED ME MORE THAN ALL THE REST FOR THERE WAS
SOMETHING INDESCRIBABLY GUILTY ABOUT THEM
MY WIFE HAD ALWAYS BEEN
A WOMAN OF A FRANK OPEN NATURE AND IT GAVE ME A CHILL TO SEE HER
SLINKING INTO HER OWN ROOM AND CRYING OUT AND WINCING WHEN HER OWN
HUSBAND SPOKE TO HER
'YOU AWAKE JACK SHE CRIED WITH A NERVOUS LAUGH
'WHY I THOUGHT
THAT NOTHING COULD AWAKE YOU
'WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN I ASKED MORE STERNLY
'I DON'T WONDER THAT YOU ARE SURPRISED SAID SHE AND I COULD SEE THAT
HER FINGERS WERE TREMBLING AS SHE UNDID THE FASTENINGS OF HER MANTLE
'WHY I NEVER REMEMBER HAVING DONE SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE BEFORE
THE
FACT IS THAT I FELT AS THOUGH I WERE CHOKING AND HAD A PERFECT LONGING
FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR
I REALLY THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE FAINTED IF
I HAD NOT GONE OUT
I STOOD AT THE DOOR FOR A FEW MINUTES AND NOW I AM
QUITE MYSELF AGAIN
ALL THE TIME THAT SHE WAS TELLING ME THIS STORY SHE NEVER ONCE LOOKED
IN MY DIRECTION AND HER VOICE WAS QUITE UNLIKE HER USUAL TONES
IT
WAS EVIDENT TO ME THAT SHE WAS SAYING WHAT WAS FALSE
I SAID NOTHING
IN REPLY BUT TURNED MY FACE TO THE WALL SICK AT HEART WITH MY MIND
FILLED WITH A THOUSAND VENOMOUS DOUBTS AND SUSPICIONS
WHAT WAS IT THAT
MY WIFE WAS CONCEALING FROM ME WHERE HAD SHE BEEN DURING THAT STRANGE
EXPEDITION I FELT THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO PEACE UNTIL I KNEW AND YET I
SHRANK FROM ASKING HER AGAIN AFTER ONCE SHE HAD TOLD ME WHAT WAS FALSE
ALL THE REST OF THE NIGHT I TOSSED AND TUMBLED FRAMING THEORY AFTER
THEORY EACH MORE UNLIKELY THAN THE LAST
I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE CITY THAT DAY BUT I WAS TOO DISTURBED IN MY
MIND TO BE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION TO BUSINESS MATTERS
MY WIFE SEEMED
TO BE AS UPSET AS MYSELF AND I COULD SEE FROM THE LITTLE QUESTIONING
GLANCES WHICH SHE KEPT SHOOTING AT ME THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT I
DISBELIEVED HER STATEMENT AND THAT SHE WAS AT HER WITS' END WHAT TO DO
WE HARDLY EXCHANGED A WORD DURING BREAKFAST AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
I WENT OUT FOR A WALK THAT I MIGHT THINK THE MATTER OUT IN THE FRESH
MORNING AIR
I WENT AS FAR AS THE CRYSTAL PALACE SPENT AN HOUR IN THE GROUNDS AND
WAS BACK IN NORBURY BY ONE O'CLOCK
IT HAPPENED THAT MY WAY TOOK ME PAST
THE COTTAGE AND I STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT TO LOOK AT THE WINDOWS AND TO
SEE IF I COULD CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE STRANGE FACE WHICH HAD LOOKED
OUT AT ME ON THE DAY BEFORE
AS I STOOD THERE IMAGINE MY SURPRISE MR
HOLMES WHEN THE DOOR SUDDENLY OPENED AND MY WIFE WALKED OUT
I WAS STRUCK DUMB WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THE SIGHT OF HER BUT MY
EMOTIONS WERE NOTHING TO THOSE WHICH SHOWED THEMSELVES UPON HER FACE
WHEN OUR EYES MET
SHE SEEMED FOR AN INSTANT TO WISH TO SHRINK BACK
INSIDE THE HOUSE AGAIN AND THEN SEEING HOW USELESS ALL CONCEALMENT
MUST BE SHE CAME FORWARD WITH A VERY WHITE FACE AND FRIGHTENED EYES
WHICH BELIED THE SMILE UPON HER LIPS
'AH JACK SHE SAID 'I HAVE JUST BEEN IN TO SEE IF I CAN BE OF ANY
ASSISTANCE TO OUR NEW NEIGHBORS
WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT JACK
YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME
'SO SAID I 'THIS IS WHERE YOU WENT DURING THE NIGHT
'WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHE CRIED
'YOU CAME HERE
I AM SURE OF IT
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT YOU SHOULD
VISIT THEM AT SUCH AN HOUR
'I HAVE NOT BEEN HERE BEFORE
'HOW CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW IS FALSE I CRIED
'YOUR VERY VOICE
CHANGES AS YOU SPEAK
WHEN HAVE I EVER HAD A SECRET FROM YOU I SHALL
ENTER THAT COTTAGE AND I SHALL PROBE THE MATTER TO THE BOTTOM
'NO NO JACK FOR GOD'S SAKE SHE GASPED IN UNCONTROLLABLE EMOTION
THEN AS I APPROACHED THE DOOR SHE SEIZED MY SLEEVE AND PULLED ME BACK
WITH CONVULSIVE STRENGTH
'I IMPLORE YOU NOT TO DO THIS JACK SHE CRIED
'I SWEAR THAT I WILL
TELL YOU EVERYTHING SOME DAY BUT NOTHING BUT MISERY CAN COME OF IT IF
YOU ENTER THAT COTTAGE THEN AS I TRIED TO SHAKE HER OFF SHE CLUNG TO
ME IN A FRENZY OF ENTREATY
'TRUST ME JACK SHE CRIED
'TRUST ME ONLY THIS ONCE
YOU WILL NEVER
HAVE CAUSE TO REGRET IT
YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE A SECRET FROM
YOU IF IT WERE NOT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE
OUR WHOLE LIVES ARE AT STAKE IN
THIS
IF YOU COME HOME WITH ME ALL WILL BE WELL
IF YOU FORCE YOUR WAY
INTO THAT COTTAGE ALL IS OVER BETWEEN US
THERE WAS SUCH EARNESTNESS SUCH DESPAIR IN HER MANNER THAT HER WORDS
ARRESTED ME AND I STOOD IRRESOLUTE BEFORE THE DOOR
'I WILL TRUST YOU ON ONE CONDITION AND ON ONE CONDITION ONLY SAID I
AT LAST
'IT IS THAT THIS MYSTERY COMES TO AN END FROM NOW
YOU ARE
AT LIBERTY TO PRESERVE YOUR SECRET BUT YOU MUST PROMISE ME THAT THERE
SHALL BE NO MORE NIGHTLY VISITS NO MORE DOINGS WHICH ARE KEPT FROM MY
KNOWLEDGE
I AM WILLING TO FORGET THOSE WHICH ARE PASSED IF YOU WILL
PROMISE THAT THERE SHALL BE NO MORE IN THE FUTURE
'I WAS SURE THAT YOU WOULD TRUST ME SHE CRIED WITH A GREAT SIGH OF
RELIEF
'IT SHALL BE JUST AS YOU WISH
COME AWAY OH COME AWAY UP TO
THE HOUSE
STILL PULLING AT MY SLEEVE SHE LED ME AWAY FROM THE COTTAGE
AS WE
WENT I GLANCED BACK AND THERE WAS THAT YELLOW LIVID FACE WATCHING US
OUT OF THE UPPER WINDOW
WHAT LINK COULD THERE BE BETWEEN THAT CREATURE
AND MY WIFE OR HOW COULD THE COARSE ROUGH WOMAN WHOM I HAD SEEN THE
DAY BEFORE BE CONNECTED WITH HER IT WAS A STRANGE PUZZLE AND YET I
KNEW THAT MY MIND COULD NEVER KNOW EASE AGAIN UNTIL I HAD SOLVED IT
FOR TWO DAYS AFTER THIS I STAYED AT HOME AND MY WIFE APPEARED TO ABIDE
LOYALLY BY OUR ENGAGEMENT FOR AS FAR AS I KNOW SHE NEVER STIRRED OUT
OF THE HOUSE
ON THE THIRD DAY HOWEVER I HAD AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT
HER SOLEMN PROMISE WAS NOT ENOUGH TO HOLD HER BACK FROM THIS SECRET
INFLUENCE WHICH DREW HER AWAY FROM HER HUSBAND AND HER DUTY
I HAD GONE INTO TOWN ON THAT DAY BUT I RETURNED BY THE 2 40 INSTEAD OF
THE 3 36 WHICH IS MY USUAL TRAIN
AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE THE MAID RAN
INTO THE HALL WITH A STARTLED FACE
'WHERE IS YOUR MISTRESS I ASKED
'I THINK THAT SHE HAS GONE OUT FOR A WALK SHE ANSWERED
MY MIND WAS INSTANTLY FILLED WITH SUSPICION
I RUSHED UPSTAIRS TO MAKE
SURE THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE HOUSE
AS I DID SO I HAPPENED TO GLANCE OUT
OF ONE OF THE UPPER WINDOWS AND SAW THE MAID WITH WHOM I HAD JUST BEEN
SPEAKING RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COTTAGE
THEN
OF COURSE I SAW EXACTLY WHAT IT ALL MEANT
MY WIFE HAD GONE OVER THERE
AND HAD ASKED THE SERVANT TO CALL HER IF I SHOULD RETURN
TINGLING WITH
ANGER I RUSHED DOWN AND HURRIED ACROSS DETERMINED TO END THE MATTER
ONCE AND FOREVER
I SAW MY WIFE AND THE MAID HURRYING BACK ALONG THE
LANE BUT I DID NOT STOP TO SPEAK WITH THEM
IN THE COTTAGE LAY THE
SECRET WHICH WAS CASTING A SHADOW OVER MY LIFE
I VOWED THAT COME WHAT
MIGHT IT SHOULD BE A SECRET NO LONGER
I DID NOT EVEN KNOCK WHEN I
REACHED IT BUT TURNED THE HANDLE AND RUSHED INTO THE PASSAGE
IT WAS ALL STILL AND QUIET UPON THE GROUND FLOOR
IN THE KITCHEN A
KETTLE WAS SINGING ON THE FIRE AND A LARGE BLACK CAT LAY COILED UP IN
THE BASKET BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THE WOMAN WHOM I HAD SEEN BEFORE
I RAN INTO THE OTHER ROOM BUT IT WAS EQUALLY DESERTED
THEN I RUSHED UP
THE STAIRS ONLY TO FIND TWO OTHER ROOMS EMPTY AND DESERTED AT THE TOP
THERE WAS NO ONE AT ALL IN THE WHOLE HOUSE
THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES
WERE OF THE MOST COMMON AND VULGAR DESCRIPTION SAVE IN THE ONE CHAMBER
AT THE WINDOW OF WHICH I HAD SEEN THE STRANGE FACE
THAT WAS COMFORTABLE
AND ELEGANT AND ALL MY SUSPICIONS ROSE INTO A FIERCE BITTER FLAME WHEN
I SAW THAT ON THE MANTELPIECE STOOD A COPY OF A FULL LENGTH PHOTOGRAPH
OF MY WIFE WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN AT MY REQUEST ONLY THREE MONTHS AGO
I STAYED LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE HOUSE WAS ABSOLUTELY
EMPTY
THEN I LEFT IT FEELING A WEIGHT AT MY HEART SUCH AS I HAD NEVER
HAD BEFORE
MY WIFE CAME OUT INTO THE HALL AS I ENTERED MY HOUSE BUT I
WAS TOO HURT AND ANGRY TO SPEAK WITH HER AND PUSHING PAST HER I MADE
MY WAY INTO MY STUDY
SHE FOLLOWED ME HOWEVER BEFORE I COULD CLOSE THE
DOOR
'I AM SORRY THAT I BROKE MY PROMISE JACK SAID SHE 'BUT IF YOU KNEW
ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD FORGIVE ME
'TELL ME EVERYTHING THEN SAID I
'I CANNOT JACK I CANNOT SHE CRIED
'UNTIL YOU TELL ME WHO IT IS THAT HAS BEEN LIVING IN THAT COTTAGE AND
WHO IT IS TO WHOM YOU HAVE GIVEN THAT PHOTOGRAPH THERE CAN NEVER BE ANY
CONFIDENCE BETWEEN US SAID I AND BREAKING AWAY FROM HER I LEFT THE
HOUSE
THAT WAS YESTERDAY MR
HOLMES AND I HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE
NOR DO I KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THIS STRANGE BUSINESS
IT IS THE FIRST
SHADOW THAT HAS COME BETWEEN US AND IT HAS SO SHAKEN ME THAT I DO NOT
KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO FOR THE BEST
SUDDENLY THIS MORNING IT OCCURRED TO
ME THAT YOU WERE THE MAN TO ADVISE ME SO I HAVE HURRIED TO YOU NOW AND
I PLACE MYSELF UNRESERVEDLY IN YOUR HANDS
IF THERE IS ANY POINT WHICH I
HAVE NOT MADE CLEAR PRAY QUESTION ME ABOUT IT
BUT ABOVE ALL TELL ME
QUICKLY WHAT I AM TO DO FOR THIS MISERY IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
HOLMES AND I HAD LISTENED WITH THE UTMOST INTEREST TO THIS EXTRAORDINARY
STATEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN DELIVERED IN THE JERKY BROKEN FASHION OF A
MAN WHO IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXTREME EMOTIONS
MY COMPANION SAT
SILENT FOR SOME TIME WITH HIS CHIN UPON HIS HAND LOST IN THOUGHT
TELL ME SAID HE AT LAST COULD YOU SWEAR THAT THIS WAS A MAN'S FACE
WHICH YOU SAW AT THE WINDOW
EACH TIME THAT I SAW IT I WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM IT SO THAT IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY
YOU APPEAR HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN DISAGREEABLY IMPRESSED BY IT
IT SEEMED TO BE OF AN UNNATURAL COLOR AND TO HAVE A STRANGE RIGIDITY
ABOUT THE FEATURES
WHEN I APPROACHED IT VANISHED WITH A JERK
HOW LONG IS IT SINCE YOUR WIFE ASKED YOU FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS
NEARLY TWO MONTHS
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PHOTOGRAPH OF HER FIRST HUSBAND
NO THERE WAS A GREAT FIRE AT ATLANTA VERY SHORTLY AFTER HIS DEATH AND
ALL HER PAPERS WERE DESTROYED
AND YET SHE HAD A CERTIFICATE OF DEATH
YOU SAY THAT YOU SAW IT
YES SHE GOT A DUPLICATE AFTER THE FIRE
DID YOU EVER MEET ANY ONE WHO KNEW HER IN AMERICA
NO
DID SHE EVER TALK OF REVISITING THE PLACE
NO
OR GET LETTERS FROM IT
NO
THANK YOU
I SHOULD LIKE TO THINK OVER THE MATTER A LITTLE NOW
IF THE
COTTAGE IS NOW PERMANENTLY DESERTED WE MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY
IF ON
THE OTHER HAND AS I FANCY IS MORE LIKELY THE INMATES WERE WARNED OF
YOUR COMING AND LEFT BEFORE YOU ENTERED YESTERDAY THEN THEY MAY BE
BACK NOW AND WE SHOULD CLEAR IT ALL UP EASILY
LET ME ADVISE YOU THEN
TO RETURN TO NORBURY AND TO EXAMINE THE WINDOWS OF THE COTTAGE AGAIN
IF YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS INHABITED DO NOT FORCE YOUR
WAY IN BUT SEND A WIRE TO MY FRIEND AND ME
WE SHALL BE WITH YOU WITHIN
AN HOUR OF RECEIVING IT AND WE SHALL THEN VERY SOON GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE BUSINESS
AND IF IT IS STILL EMPTY
IN THAT CASE I SHALL COME OUT TO MORROW AND TALK IT OVER WITH YOU
GOOD BY AND ABOVE ALL DO NOT FRET UNTIL YOU KNOW THAT YOU REALLY HAVE
A CAUSE FOR IT
I AM AFRAID THAT THIS IS A BAD BUSINESS WATSON SAID MY COMPANION AS
HE RETURNED AFTER ACCOMPANYING MR
GRANT MUNRO TO THE DOOR
WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF IT
IT HAD AN UGLY SOUND I ANSWERED
YES
THERE'S BLACKMAIL IN IT OR I AM MUCH MISTAKEN
AND WHO IS THE BLACKMAILER
WELL IT MUST BE THE CREATURE WHO LIVES IN THE ONLY COMFORTABLE ROOM
IN THE PLACE AND HAS HER PHOTOGRAPH ABOVE HIS FIREPLACE
UPON MY WORD
WATSON THERE IS SOMETHING VERY ATTRACTIVE ABOUT THAT LIVID FACE AT THE
WINDOW AND I WOULD NOT HAVE MISSED THE CASE FOR WORLDS
YOU HAVE A THEORY
YES A PROVISIONAL ONE
BUT I SHALL BE SURPRISED IF IT DOES NOT TURN
OUT TO BE CORRECT
THIS WOMAN'S FIRST HUSBAND IS IN THAT COTTAGE
WHY DO YOU THINK SO
HOW ELSE CAN WE EXPLAIN HER FRENZIED ANXIETY THAT HER SECOND ONE SHOULD
NOT ENTER IT THE FACTS AS I READ THEM ARE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
THIS WOMAN WAS MARRIED IN AMERICA
HER HUSBAND DEVELOPED SOME HATEFUL
QUALITIES OR SHALL WE SAY THAT HE CONTRACTED SOME LOATHSOME DISEASE
AND BECAME A LEPER OR AN IMBECILE SHE FLIES FROM HIM AT LAST RETURNS
TO ENGLAND CHANGES HER NAME AND STARTS HER LIFE AS SHE THINKS
AFRESH
SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED THREE YEARS AND BELIEVES THAT HER POSITION
IS QUITE SECURE HAVING SHOWN HER HUSBAND THE DEATH CERTIFICATE OF
SOME MAN WHOSE NAME SHE HAS ASSUMED WHEN SUDDENLY HER WHEREABOUTS
IS DISCOVERED BY HER FIRST HUSBAND OR WE MAY SUPPOSE BY SOME
UNSCRUPULOUS WOMAN WHO HAS ATTACHED HERSELF TO THE INVALID
THEY WRITE
TO THE WIFE AND THREATEN TO COME AND EXPOSE HER
SHE ASKS FOR A HUNDRED
POUNDS AND ENDEAVORS TO BUY THEM OFF
THEY COME IN SPITE OF IT AND
WHEN THE HUSBAND MENTIONS CASUALLY TO THE WIFE THAT THERE ARE NEW COMERS
IN THE COTTAGE SHE KNOWS IN SOME WAY THAT THEY ARE HER PURSUERS
SHE
WAITS UNTIL HER HUSBAND IS ASLEEP AND THEN SHE RUSHES DOWN TO ENDEAVOR
TO PERSUADE THEM TO LEAVE HER IN PEACE
HAVING NO SUCCESS SHE GOES
AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND HER HUSBAND MEETS HER AS HE HAS TOLD US AS
SHE COMES OUT
SHE PROMISES HIM THEN NOT TO GO THERE AGAIN BUT TWO DAYS
AFTERWARDS THE HOPE OF GETTING RID OF THOSE DREADFUL NEIGHBORS WAS TOO
STRONG FOR HER AND SHE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TAKING DOWN WITH HER THE
PHOTOGRAPH WHICH HAD PROBABLY BEEN DEMANDED FROM HER
IN THE MIDST OF
THIS INTERVIEW THE MAID RUSHED IN TO SAY THAT THE MASTER HAD COME HOME
ON WHICH THE WIFE KNOWING THAT HE WOULD COME STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE
COTTAGE HURRIED THE INMATES OUT AT THE BACK DOOR INTO THE GROVE OF
FIR TREES PROBABLY WHICH WAS MENTIONED AS STANDING NEAR
IN THIS WAY
HE FOUND THE PLACE DESERTED
I SHALL BE VERY MUCH SURPRISED HOWEVER IF
IT IS STILL SO WHEN HE RECONNOITRES IT THIS EVENING
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY THEORY
IT IS ALL SURMISE
BUT AT LEAST IT COVERS ALL THE FACTS
WHEN NEW FACTS COME TO OUR
KNOWLEDGE WHICH CANNOT BE COVERED BY IT IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO
RECONSIDER IT
WE CAN DO NOTHING MORE UNTIL WE HAVE A MESSAGE FROM OUR
FRIEND AT NORBURY
BUT WE HAD NOT A VERY LONG TIME TO WAIT FOR THAT
IT CAME JUST AS WE HAD
FINISHED OUR TEA
THE COTTAGE IS STILL TENANTED IT SAID
HAVE SEEN
THE FACE AGAIN AT THE WINDOW
WILL MEET THE SEVEN O'CLOCK TRAIN AND
WILL TAKE NO STEPS UNTIL YOU ARRIVE
HE WAS WAITING ON THE PLATFORM WHEN WE STEPPED OUT AND WE COULD SEE IN
THE LIGHT OF THE STATION LAMPS THAT HE WAS VERY PALE AND QUIVERING WITH
AGITATION
THEY ARE STILL THERE MR
HOLMES SAID HE LAYING HIS HAND HARD UPON
MY FRIEND'S SLEEVE
I SAW LIGHTS IN THE COTTAGE AS I CAME DOWN
WE
SHALL SETTLE IT NOW ONCE AND FOR ALL
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN THEN ASKED HOLMES AS HE WALKED DOWN THE DARK
TREE LINED ROAD
I AM GOING TO FORCE MY WAY IN AND SEE FOR MYSELF WHO IS IN THE HOUSE
I
WISH YOU BOTH TO BE THERE AS WITNESSES
YOU ARE QUITE DETERMINED TO DO THIS IN SPITE OF YOUR WIFE'S WARNING
THAT IT IS BETTER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT SOLVE THE MYSTERY
YES I AM DETERMINED
WELL I THINK THAT YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT
ANY TRUTH IS BETTER THAN
INDEFINITE DOUBT
WE HAD BETTER GO UP AT ONCE
OF COURSE LEGALLY WE
ARE PUTTING OURSELVES HOPELESSLY IN THE WRONG BUT I THINK THAT IT IS
WORTH IT
IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT AND A THIN RAIN BEGAN TO FALL AS WE TURNED
FROM THE HIGH ROAD INTO A NARROW LANE DEEPLY RUTTED WITH HEDGES ON
EITHER SIDE
MR
GRANT MUNRO PUSHED IMPATIENTLY FORWARD HOWEVER AND WE
STUMBLED AFTER HIM AS BEST WE COULD
THERE ARE THE LIGHTS OF MY HOUSE HE MURMURED POINTING TO A GLIMMER
AMONG THE TREES
AND HERE IS THE COTTAGE WHICH I AM GOING TO ENTER
WE TURNED A CORNER IN THE LANE AS HE SPOKE AND THERE WAS THE BUILDING
CLOSE BESIDE US
A YELLOW BAR FALLING ACROSS THE BLACK FOREGROUND SHOWED
THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE CLOSED AND ONE WINDOW IN THE UPPER STORY
WAS BRIGHTLY ILLUMINATED
AS WE LOOKED WE SAW A DARK BLUR MOVING ACROSS
THE BLIND
THERE IS THAT CREATURE CRIED GRANT MUNRO
YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELVES
THAT SOME ONE IS THERE
NOW FOLLOW ME AND WE SHALL SOON KNOW ALL
WE APPROACHED THE DOOR BUT SUDDENLY A WOMAN APPEARED OUT OF THE SHADOW
AND STOOD IN THE GOLDEN TRACK OF THE LAMP LIGHT
I COULD NOT SEE HER
FACE IN THE DARKNESS BUT HER ARMS WERE THROWN OUT IN AN ATTITUDE OF
ENTREATY
FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T JACK SHE CRIED
I HAD A PRESENTIMENT THAT YOU
WOULD COME THIS EVENING
THINK BETTER OF IT DEAR TRUST ME AGAIN AND
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE CAUSE TO REGRET IT
I HAVE TRUSTED YOU TOO LONG EFFIE HE CRIED STERNLY
LEAVE GO OF
ME I MUST PASS YOU
MY FRIENDS AND I ARE GOING TO SETTLE THIS MATTER
ONCE AND FOREVER HE PUSHED HER TO ONE SIDE AND WE FOLLOWED CLOSELY
AFTER HIM
AS HE THREW THE DOOR OPEN AN OLD WOMAN RAN OUT IN FRONT OF
HIM AND TRIED TO BAR HIS PASSAGE BUT HE THRUST HER BACK AND AN INSTANT
AFTERWARDS WE WERE ALL UPON THE STAIRS
GRANT MUNRO RUSHED INTO THE
LIGHTED ROOM AT THE TOP AND WE ENTERED AT HIS HEELS
IT WAS A COSEY WELL FURNISHED APARTMENT WITH TWO CANDLES BURNING UPON
THE TABLE AND TWO UPON THE MANTELPIECE
IN THE CORNER STOOPING OVER A
DESK THERE SAT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LITTLE GIRL
HER FACE WAS TURNED
AWAY AS WE ENTERED BUT WE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS DRESSED IN A RED
FROCK AND THAT SHE HAD LONG WHITE GLOVES ON
AS SHE WHISKED ROUND
TO US I GAVE A CRY OF SURPRISE AND HORROR
THE FACE WHICH SHE TURNED
TOWARDS US WAS OF THE STRANGEST LIVID TINT AND THE FEATURES WERE
ABSOLUTELY DEVOID OF ANY EXPRESSION
AN INSTANT LATER THE MYSTERY WAS
EXPLAINED
HOLMES WITH A LAUGH PASSED HIS HAND BEHIND THE CHILD'S
EAR A MASK PEELED OFF FROM HER COUNTENANCE AND THERE WAS A LITTLE COAL
BLACK NEGRESS WITH ALL HER WHITE TEETH FLASHING IN AMUSEMENT AT OUR
AMAZED FACES
I BURST OUT LAUGHING OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH HER MERRIMENT
BUT GRANT MUNRO STOOD STARING WITH HIS HAND CLUTCHING HIS THROAT
MY GOD HE CRIED
WHAT CAN BE THE MEANING OF THIS
I WILL TELL YOU THE MEANING OF IT CRIED THE LADY SWEEPING INTO
THE ROOM WITH A PROUD SET FACE
YOU HAVE FORCED ME AGAINST MY OWN
JUDGMENT TO TELL YOU AND NOW WE MUST BOTH MAKE THE BEST OF IT
MY
HUSBAND DIED AT ATLANTA
MY CHILD SURVIVED
YOUR CHILD
SHE DREW A LARGE SILVER LOCKET FROM HER BOSOM
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS
OPEN
I UNDERSTOOD THAT IT DID NOT OPEN
SHE TOUCHED A SPRING AND THE FRONT HINGED BACK
THERE WAS A PORTRAIT
WITHIN OF A MAN STRIKINGLY HANDSOME AND INTELLIGENT LOOKING BUT BEARING
UNMISTAKABLE SIGNS UPON HIS FEATURES OF HIS AFRICAN DESCENT
THAT IS JOHN HEBRON OF ATLANTA SAID THE LADY AND A NOBLER MAN
NEVER WALKED THE EARTH
I CUT MYSELF OFF FROM MY RACE IN ORDER TO WED
HIM BUT NEVER ONCE WHILE HE LIVED DID I FOR AN INSTANT REGRET IT
IT
WAS OUR MISFORTUNE THAT OUR ONLY CHILD TOOK AFTER HIS PEOPLE RATHER THAN
MINE
IT IS OFTEN SO IN SUCH MATCHES AND LITTLE LUCY IS DARKER FAR THAN
EVER HER FATHER WAS
BUT DARK OR FAIR SHE IS MY OWN DEAR LITTLE GIRLIE
AND HER MOTHER'S PET THE LITTLE CREATURE RAN ACROSS AT THE WORDS AND
NESTLED UP AGAINST THE LADY'S DRESS
WHEN I LEFT HER IN AMERICA SHE
CONTINUED IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE HER HEALTH WAS WEAK AND THE CHANGE
MIGHT HAVE DONE HER HARM
SHE WAS GIVEN TO THE CARE OF A FAITHFUL SCOTCH
WOMAN WHO HAD ONCE BEEN OUR SERVANT
NEVER FOR AN INSTANT DID I DREAM
OF DISOWNING HER AS MY CHILD
BUT WHEN CHANCE THREW YOU IN MY WAY JACK
AND I LEARNED TO LOVE YOU I FEARED TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY CHILD
GOD
FORGIVE ME I FEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE YOU AND I HAD NOT THE COURAGE
TO TELL YOU
I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU AND IN MY WEAKNESS I TURNED
AWAY FROM MY OWN LITTLE GIRL
FOR THREE YEARS I HAVE KEPT HER EXISTENCE
A SECRET FROM YOU BUT I HEARD FROM THE NURSE AND I KNEW THAT ALL WAS
WELL WITH HER
AT LAST HOWEVER THERE CAME AN OVERWHELMING DESIRE TO
SEE THE CHILD ONCE MORE
I STRUGGLED AGAINST IT BUT IN VAIN
THOUGH I
KNEW THE DANGER I DETERMINED TO HAVE THE CHILD OVER IF IT WERE BUT
FOR A FEW WEEKS
I SENT A HUNDRED POUNDS TO THE NURSE AND I GAVE HER
INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT THIS COTTAGE SO THAT SHE MIGHT COME AS A NEIGHBOR
WITHOUT MY APPEARING TO BE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH HER
I PUSHED MY
PRECAUTIONS SO FAR AS TO ORDER HER TO KEEP THE CHILD IN THE HOUSE DURING
THE DAYTIME AND TO COVER UP HER LITTLE FACE AND HANDS SO THAT EVEN
THOSE WHO MIGHT SEE HER AT THE WINDOW SHOULD NOT GOSSIP ABOUT THERE
BEING A BLACK CHILD IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IF I HAD BEEN LESS CAUTIOUS
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE WISE BUT I WAS HALF CRAZY WITH FEAR THAT YOU
SHOULD LEARN THE TRUTH
IT WAS YOU WHO TOLD ME FIRST THAT THE COTTAGE WAS OCCUPIED
I SHOULD
HAVE WAITED FOR THE MORNING BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP FOR EXCITEMENT AND
SO AT LAST I SLIPPED OUT KNOWING HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO AWAKE YOU
BUT
YOU SAW ME GO AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY TROUBLES
NEXT DAY YOU
HAD MY SECRET AT YOUR MERCY BUT YOU NOBLY REFRAINED FROM PURSUING YOUR
ADVANTAGE
THREE DAYS LATER HOWEVER THE NURSE AND CHILD ONLY JUST
ESCAPED FROM THE BACK DOOR AS YOU RUSHED IN AT THE FRONT ONE
AND NOW
TO NIGHT YOU AT LAST KNOW ALL AND I ASK YOU WHAT IS TO BECOME OF US MY
CHILD AND ME SHE CLASPED HER HANDS AND WAITED FOR AN ANSWER
IT WAS A LONG TEN MINUTES BEFORE GRANT MUNRO BROKE THE SILENCE AND
WHEN HIS ANSWER CAME IT WAS ONE OF WHICH I LOVE TO THINK
HE LIFTED
THE LITTLE CHILD KISSED HER AND THEN STILL CARRYING HER HE HELD HIS
OTHER HAND OUT TO HIS WIFE AND TURNED TOWARDS THE DOOR
WE CAN TALK IT OVER MORE COMFORTABLY AT HOME SAID HE
I AM NOT A
VERY GOOD MAN EFFIE BUT I THINK THAT I AM A BETTER ONE THAN YOU HAVE
GIVEN ME CREDIT FOR BEING
HOLMES AND I FOLLOWED THEM DOWN THE LANE AND MY FRIEND PLUCKED AT MY
SLEEVE AS WE CAME OUT
I THINK SAID HE THAT WE SHALL BE OF MORE USE IN LONDON THAN IN
NORBURY
NOT ANOTHER WORD DID HE SAY OF THE CASE UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE
WAS TURNING AWAY WITH HIS LIGHTED CANDLE FOR HIS BEDROOM
WATSON SAID HE IF IT SHOULD EVER STRIKE YOU THAT I AM GETTING A
LITTLE OVER CONFIDENT IN MY POWERS OR GIVING LESS PAINS TO A CASE
THAN IT DESERVES KINDLY WHISPER 'NORBURY' IN MY EAR AND I SHALL BE
INFINITELY OBLIGED TO YOU
ADVENTURE III
THE STOCK BROKER'S CLERK
SHORTLY AFTER MY MARRIAGE I HAD BOUGHT A CONNECTION IN THE PADDINGTON
DISTRICT
OLD MR
FARQUHAR FROM WHOM I PURCHASED IT HAD AT ONE TIME AN
EXCELLENT GENERAL PRACTICE BUT HIS AGE AND AN AFFLICTION OF THE NATURE
OF ST
VITUS'S DANCE FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED HAD VERY MUCH THINNED IT
THE PUBLIC NOT UNNATURALLY GOES ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT HE WHO WOULD HEAL
OTHERS MUST HIMSELF BE WHOLE AND LOOKS ASKANCE AT THE CURATIVE POWERS
OF THE MAN WHOSE OWN CASE IS BEYOND THE REACH OF HIS DRUGS
THUS AS MY
PREDECESSOR WEAKENED HIS PRACTICE DECLINED UNTIL WHEN I PURCHASED
IT FROM HIM IT HAD SUNK FROM TWELVE HUNDRED TO LITTLE MORE THAN THREE
HUNDRED A YEAR
I HAD CONFIDENCE HOWEVER IN MY OWN YOUTH AND ENERGY
AND WAS CONVINCED THAT IN A VERY FEW YEARS THE CONCERN WOULD BE AS
FLOURISHING AS EVER
FOR THREE MONTHS AFTER TAKING OVER THE PRACTICE I WAS KEPT VERY CLOSELY
AT WORK AND SAW LITTLE OF MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES FOR I WAS TOO BUSY
TO VISIT BAKER STREET AND HE SELDOM WENT ANYWHERE HIMSELF SAVE UPON
PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS
I WAS SURPRISED THEREFORE WHEN ONE MORNING IN
JUNE AS I SAT READING THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL AFTER BREAKFAST I
HEARD A RING AT THE BELL FOLLOWED BY THE HIGH SOMEWHAT STRIDENT TONES
OF MY OLD COMPANION'S VOICE
AH MY DEAR WATSON SAID HE STRIDING INTO THE ROOM I AM VERY
DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU I TRUST THAT MRS
WATSON HAS ENTIRELY RECOVERED
FROM ALL THE LITTLE EXCITEMENTS CONNECTED WITH OUR ADVENTURE OF THE SIGN
OF FOUR
THANK YOU WE ARE BOTH VERY WELL SAID I SHAKING HIM WARMLY BY THE
HAND
AND I HOPE ALSO HE CONTINUED SITTING DOWN IN THE ROCKING CHAIR
THAT THE CARES OF MEDICAL PRACTICE HAVE NOT ENTIRELY OBLITERATED THE
INTEREST WHICH YOU USED TO TAKE IN OUR LITTLE DEDUCTIVE PROBLEMS
ON THE CONTRARY I ANSWERED IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT THAT I WAS
LOOKING OVER MY OLD NOTES AND CLASSIFYING SOME OF OUR PAST RESULTS
I TRUST THAT YOU DON'T CONSIDER YOUR COLLECTION CLOSED
NOT AT ALL
I SHOULD WISH NOTHING BETTER THAN TO HAVE SOME MORE OF SUCH
EXPERIENCES
TO DAY FOR EXAMPLE
YES TO DAY IF YOU LIKE
AND AS FAR OFF AS BIRMINGHAM
CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH IT
AND THE PRACTICE
I DO MY NEIGHBOR'S WHEN HE GOES
HE IS ALWAYS READY TO WORK OFF THE
DEBT
HA NOTHING COULD BE BETTER SAID HOLMES LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR
AND LOOKING KEENLY AT ME FROM UNDER HIS HALF CLOSED LIDS
I PERCEIVE
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN UNWELL LATELY
SUMMER COLDS ARE ALWAYS A LITTLE
TRYING
I WAS CONFINED TO THE HOUSE BY A SEVERE CHILL FOR THREE DAYS LAST WEEK
I THOUGHT HOWEVER THAT I HAD CAST OFF EVERY TRACE OF IT
SO YOU HAVE
YOU LOOK REMARKABLY ROBUST
HOW THEN DID YOU KNOW OF IT
MY DEAR FELLOW YOU KNOW MY METHODS
YOU DEDUCED IT THEN
CERTAINLY
AND FROM WHAT
FROM YOUR SLIPPERS
I GLANCED DOWN AT THE NEW PATENT LEATHERS WHICH I WAS WEARING
HOW ON
EARTH I BEGAN BUT HOLMES ANSWERED MY QUESTION BEFORE IT WAS ASKED
YOUR SLIPPERS ARE NEW HE SAID
YOU COULD NOT HAVE HAD THEM MORE THAN
A FEW WEEKS
THE SOLES WHICH YOU ARE AT THIS MOMENT PRESENTING TO ME ARE
SLIGHTLY SCORCHED
FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT HAVE GOT WET AND
BEEN BURNED IN THE DRYING
BUT NEAR THE INSTEP THERE IS A SMALL CIRCULAR
WAFER OF PAPER WITH THE SHOPMAN'S HIEROGLYPHICS UPON IT
DAMP WOULD OF
COURSE HAVE REMOVED THIS
YOU HAD THEN BEEN SITTING WITH YOUR FEET
OUTSTRETCHED TO THE FIRE WHICH A MAN WOULD HARDLY DO EVEN IN SO WET A
JUNE AS THIS IF HE WERE IN HIS FULL HEALTH
LIKE ALL HOLMES'S REASONING THE THING SEEMED SIMPLICITY ITSELF WHEN IT
WAS ONCE EXPLAINED
HE READ THE THOUGHT UPON MY FEATURES AND HIS SMILE
HAD A TINGE OF BITTERNESS
I AM AFRAID THAT I RATHER GIVE MYSELF AWAY WHEN I EXPLAIN SAID HE
RESULTS WITHOUT CAUSES ARE MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE
YOU ARE READY TO COME
TO BIRMINGHAM THEN
CERTAINLY
WHAT IS THE CASE
YOU SHALL HEAR IT ALL IN THE TRAIN
MY CLIENT IS OUTSIDE IN A
FOUR WHEELER
CAN YOU COME AT ONCE
IN AN INSTANT I SCRIBBLED A NOTE TO MY NEIGHBOR RUSHED UPSTAIRS TO
EXPLAIN THE MATTER TO MY WIFE AND JOINED HOLMES UPON THE DOOR STEP
YOUR NEIGHBOR IS A DOCTOR SAID HE NODDING AT THE BRASS PLATE
YES HE BOUGHT A PRACTICE AS I DID
AN OLD ESTABLISHED ONE
JUST THE SAME AS MINE
BOTH HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE THE HOUSES WERE
BUILT
AH THEN YOU GOT HOLD OF THE BEST OF THE TWO
I THINK I DID
BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW
BY THE STEPS MY BOY
YOURS ARE WORN THREE INCHES DEEPER THAN HIS
BUT
THIS GENTLEMAN IN THE CAB IS MY CLIENT MR
HALL PYCROFT
ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM
WHIP YOUR HORSE UP CABBY FOR WE HAVE ONLY JUST
TIME TO CATCH OUR TRAIN
THE MAN WHOM I FOUND MYSELF FACING WAS A WELL BUILT FRESH COMPLEXIONED
YOUNG FELLOW WITH A FRANK HONEST FACE AND A SLIGHT CRISP YELLOW
MUSTACHE
HE WORE A VERY SHINY TOP HAT AND A NEAT SUIT OF SOBER BLACK
WHICH MADE HIM LOOK WHAT HE WAS A SMART YOUNG CITY MAN OF THE CLASS
WHO HAVE BEEN LABELED COCKNEYS BUT WHO GIVE US OUR CRACK VOLUNTEER
REGIMENTS AND WHO TURN OUT MORE FINE ATHLETES AND SPORTSMEN THAN ANY
BODY OF MEN IN THESE ISLANDS
HIS ROUND RUDDY FACE WAS NATURALLY FULL
OF CHEERINESS BUT THE CORNERS OF HIS MOUTH SEEMED TO ME TO BE PULLED
DOWN IN A HALF COMICAL DISTRESS
IT WAS NOT HOWEVER UNTIL WE WERE
ALL IN A FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE AND WELL STARTED UPON OUR JOURNEY TO
BIRMINGHAM THAT I WAS ABLE TO LEARN WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS WHICH HAD
DRIVEN HIM TO SHERLOCK HOLMES
WE HAVE A CLEAR RUN HERE OF SEVENTY MINUTES HOLMES REMARKED
I
WANT YOU MR
HALL PYCROFT TO TELL MY FRIEND YOUR VERY INTERESTING
EXPERIENCE EXACTLY AS YOU HAVE TOLD IT TO ME OR WITH MORE DETAIL IF
POSSIBLE
IT WILL BE OF USE TO ME TO HEAR THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS
AGAIN
IT IS A CASE WATSON WHICH MAY PROVE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN IT OR
MAY PROVE TO HAVE NOTHING BUT WHICH AT LEAST PRESENTS THOSE UNUSUAL
AND OUTR FEATURES WHICH ARE AS DEAR TO YOU AS THEY ARE TO ME
NOW MR
PYCROFT I SHALL NOT INTERRUPT YOU AGAIN
OUR YOUNG COMPANION LOOKED AT ME WITH A TWINKLE IN HIS EYE
THE WORST OF THE STORY IS SAID HE THAT I SHOW MYSELF UP AS SUCH A
CONFOUNDED FOOL
OF COURSE IT MAY WORK OUT ALL RIGHT AND I DON'T SEE
THAT I COULD HAVE DONE OTHERWISE BUT IF I HAVE LOST MY CRIB AND GET
NOTHING IN EXCHANGE I SHALL FEEL WHAT A SOFT JOHNNIE I HAVE BEEN
I'M
NOT VERY GOOD AT TELLING A STORY DR
WATSON BUT IT IS LIKE THIS WITH
ME
I USED TO HAVE A BILLET AT COXON WOODHOUSE'S OF DRAPER'S GARDENS
BUT THEY WERE LET IN EARLY IN THE SPRING THROUGH THE VENEZUELAN LOAN
AS NO DOUBT YOU REMEMBER AND CAME A NASTY CROPPER
I HAD BEEN WITH THEM
FIVE YEARS AND OLD COXON GAVE ME A RIPPING GOOD TESTIMONIAL WHEN
THE SMASH CAME BUT OF COURSE WE CLERKS WERE ALL TURNED ADRIFT THE
TWENTY SEVEN OF US
I TRIED HERE AND TRIED THERE BUT THERE WERE LOTS OF
OTHER CHAPS ON THE SAME LAY AS MYSELF AND IT WAS A PERFECT FROST FOR A
LONG TIME
I HAD BEEN TAKING THREE POUNDS A WEEK AT COXON'S AND I HAD
SAVED ABOUT SEVENTY OF THEM BUT I SOON WORKED MY WAY THROUGH THAT AND
OUT AT THE OTHER END
I WAS FAIRLY AT THE END OF MY TETHER AT LAST
AND COULD HARDLY FIND THE STAMPS TO ANSWER THE ADVERTISEMENTS OR THE
ENVELOPES TO STICK THEM TO
I HAD WORN OUT MY BOOTS PADDLING UP OFFICE
STAIRS AND I SEEMED JUST AS FAR FROM GETTING A BILLET AS EVER
AT LAST I SAW A VACANCY AT MAWSON WILLIAMS'S THE GREAT STOCK BROKING
FIRM IN LOMBARD STREET
I DARE SAY E
C
IS NOT MUCH IN YOUR LINE BUT
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS ABOUT THE RICHEST HOUSE IN LONDON
THE ADVERTISEMENT WAS TO BE ANSWERED BY LETTER ONLY
I SENT IN MY
TESTIMONIAL AND APPLICATION BUT WITHOUT THE LEAST HOPE OF GETTING IT
BACK CAME AN ANSWER BY RETURN SAYING THAT IF I WOULD APPEAR NEXT MONDAY
I MIGHT TAKE OVER MY NEW DUTIES AT ONCE PROVIDED THAT MY APPEARANCE WAS
SATISFACTORY
NO ONE KNOWS HOW THESE THINGS ARE WORKED
SOME PEOPLE SAY
THAT THE MANAGER JUST PLUNGES HIS HAND INTO THE HEAP AND TAKES THE FIRST
THAT COMES
ANYHOW IT WAS MY INNINGS THAT TIME AND I DON'T EVER WISH TO
FEEL BETTER PLEASED
THE SCREW WAS A POUND A WEEK RISE AND THE DUTIES
JUST ABOUT THE SAME AS AT COXON'S
AND NOW I COME TO THE QUEER PART OF THE BUSINESS
I WAS IN DIGGINGS OUT
HAMPSTEAD WAY 17 POTTER'S TERRACE
WELL I WAS SITTING DOING A SMOKE
THAT VERY EVENING AFTER I HAD BEEN PROMISED THE APPOINTMENT WHEN UP
CAME MY LANDLADY WITH A CARD WHICH HAD 'ARTHUR PINNER FINANCIAL AGENT
PRINTED UPON IT
I HAD NEVER HEARD THE NAME BEFORE AND COULD NOT IMAGINE
WHAT HE WANTED WITH ME BUT OF COURSE I ASKED HER TO SHOW HIM UP
IN
HE WALKED A MIDDLE SIZED DARK HAIRED DARK EYED BLACK BEARDED MAN
WITH A TOUCH OF THE SHEENY ABOUT HIS NOSE
HE HAD A BRISK KIND OF WAY
WITH HIM AND SPOKE SHARPLY LIKE A MAN WHO KNEW THE VALUE OF TIME
'MR
HALL PYCROFT I BELIEVE SAID HE
'YES SIR I ANSWERED PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
'LATELY ENGAGED AT COXON WOODHOUSE'S
'YES SIR
'AND NOW ON THE STAFF OF MAWSON'S
'QUITE SO
'WELL SAID HE 'THE FACT IS THAT I HAVE HEARD SOME REALLY
EXTRAORDINARY STORIES ABOUT YOUR FINANCIAL ABILITY
YOU REMEMBER PARKER
WHO USED TO BE COXON'S MANAGER HE CAN NEVER SAY ENOUGH ABOUT IT
OF COURSE I WAS PLEASED TO HEAR THIS
I HAD ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY SHARP IN
THE OFFICE BUT I HAD NEVER DREAMED THAT I WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE CITY
IN THIS FASHION
'YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY SAID HE
'PRETTY FAIR I ANSWERED MODESTLY
'HAVE YOU KEPT IN TOUCH WITH THE MARKET WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN OUT OF
WORK HE ASKED
'YES
I READ THE STOCK EXCHANGE LIST EVERY MORNING
'NOW THAT SHOWS REAL APPLICATION HE CRIED
'THAT IS THE WAY TO
PROSPER YOU WON'T MIND MY TESTING YOU WILL YOU LET ME SEE
HOW ARE
AYRSHIRES
'A HUNDRED AND SIX AND A QUARTER TO A HUNDRED AND FIVE AND
SEVEN EIGHTHS
'AND NEW ZEALAND CONSOLIDATED
'A HUNDRED AND FOUR
'AND BRITISH BROKEN HILLS
'SEVEN TO SEVEN AND SIX
'WONDERFUL HE CRIED WITH HIS HANDS UP
'THIS QUITE FITS IN WITH ALL
THAT I HAD HEARD
MY BOY MY BOY YOU ARE VERY MUCH TOO GOOD TO BE A
CLERK AT MAWSON'S
THIS OUTBURST RATHER ASTONISHED ME AS YOU CAN THINK
'WELL SAID I
'OTHER PEOPLE DON'T THINK QUITE SO MUCH OF ME AS YOU SEEM TO DO MR
PINNER
I HAD A HARD ENOUGH FIGHT TO GET THIS BERTH AND I AM VERY GLAD
TO HAVE IT
'POOH MAN YOU SHOULD SOAR ABOVE IT
YOU ARE NOT IN YOUR TRUE SPHERE
NOW I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT STANDS WITH ME
WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER IS LITTLE
ENOUGH WHEN MEASURED BY YOUR ABILITY BUT WHEN COMPARED WITH MAWSON'S
IT'S LIGHT TO DARK
LET ME SEE
WHEN DO YOU GO TO MAWSON'S
'ON MONDAY
'HA HA I THINK I WOULD RISK A LITTLE SPORTING FLUTTER THAT YOU DON'T
GO THERE AT ALL
'NOT GO TO MAWSON'S
'NO SIR
BY THAT DAY YOU WILL BE THE BUSINESS MANAGER OF THE
FRANCO MIDLAND HARDWARE COMPANY LIMITED WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR
BRANCHES IN THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES OF FRANCE NOT COUNTING ONE IN
BRUSSELS AND ONE IN SAN REMO
THIS TOOK MY BREATH AWAY
'I NEVER HEARD OF IT SAID I
'VERY LIKELY NOT
IT HAS BEEN KEPT VERY QUIET FOR THE CAPITAL WAS ALL
PRIVATELY SUBSCRIBED AND IT'S TOO GOOD A THING TO LET THE PUBLIC
INTO
MY BROTHER HARRY PINNER IS PROMOTER AND JOINS THE BOARD AFTER
ALLOTMENT AS MANAGING DIRECTOR
HE KNEW I WAS IN THE SWIM DOWN HERE AND
ASKED ME TO PICK UP A GOOD MAN CHEAP
A YOUNG PUSHING MAN WITH PLENTY
OF SNAP ABOUT HIM
PARKER SPOKE OF YOU AND THAT BROUGHT ME HERE
TO NIGHT
WE CAN ONLY OFFER YOU A BEGGARLY FIVE HUNDRED TO START WITH
'FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR I SHOUTED
'ONLY THAT AT THE BEGINNING BUT YOU ARE TO HAVE AN OVERRIDING
COMMISSION OF ONE PER CENT ON ALL BUSINESS DONE BY YOUR AGENTS AND YOU
MAY TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT THIS WILL COME TO MORE THAN YOUR SALARY
'BUT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HARDWARE
'TUT MY BOY YOU KNOW ABOUT FIGURES
MY HEAD BUZZED AND I COULD HARDLY SIT STILL IN MY CHAIR
BUT SUDDENLY
A LITTLE CHILL OF DOUBT CAME UPON ME
'I MUST BE FRANK WITH YOU SAID I
'MAWSON ONLY GIVES ME TWO HUNDRED
BUT MAWSON IS SAFE
NOW REALLY I KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT YOUR COMPANY
THAT
'AH SMART SMART HE CRIED IN A KIND OF ECSTASY OF DELIGHT
'YOU
ARE THE VERY MAN FOR US
YOU ARE NOT TO BE TALKED OVER AND QUITE RIGHT
TOO
NOW HERE'S A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS AND IF YOU THINK THAT WE
CAN DO BUSINESS YOU MAY JUST SLIP IT INTO YOUR POCKET AS AN ADVANCE UPON
YOUR SALARY
'THAT IS VERY HANDSOME SAID I
'WHEN SHOULD I TAKE OVER MY NEW
DUTIES
'BE IN BIRMINGHAM TO MORROW AT ONE SAID HE
'I HAVE A NOTE IN MY
POCKET HERE WHICH YOU WILL TAKE TO MY BROTHER
YOU WILL FIND HIM AT
126B CORPORATION STREET WHERE THE TEMPORARY OFFICES OF THE COMPANY
ARE SITUATED
OF COURSE HE MUST CONFIRM YOUR ENGAGEMENT BUT BETWEEN
OURSELVES IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT
'REALLY I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE MR
PINNER SAID
I
'NOT AT ALL MY BOY
YOU HAVE ONLY GOT YOUR DESERTS
THERE ARE ONE OR
TWO SMALL THINGS MERE FORMALITIES WHICH I MUST ARRANGE WITH YOU
YOU HAVE A BIT OF PAPER BESIDE YOU THERE
KINDLY WRITE UPON IT I AM
PERFECTLY WILLING TO ACT AS BUSINESS MANAGER TO THE FRANCO MIDLAND
HARDWARE COMPANY LIMITED AT A MINIMUM SALARY OF L500
I DID AS HE ASKED AND HE PUT THE PAPER IN HIS POCKET
'THERE IS ONE OTHER DETAIL SAID HE
'WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO ABOUT
MAWSON'S
I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT MAWSON'S IN MY JOY
'I'LL WRITE AND RESIGN
SAID I
'PRECISELY WHAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO
I HAD A ROW OVER YOU WITH
MAWSON'S MANAGER
I HAD GONE UP TO ASK HIM ABOUT YOU AND HE WAS VERY
OFFENSIVE ACCUSED ME OF COAXING YOU AWAY FROM THE SERVICE OF THE FIRM
AND THAT SORT OF THING
AT LAST I FAIRLY LOST MY TEMPER
IF YOU WANT
GOOD MEN YOU SHOULD PAY THEM A GOOD PRICE SAID I
'HE WOULD RATHER HAVE OUR SMALL PRICE THAN YOUR BIG ONE SAID HE
'I'LL LAY YOU A FIVER SAID I 'THAT WHEN HE HAS MY OFFER YOU'LL NEVER
SO MUCH AS HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN
'DONE SAID HE
'WE PICKED HIM OUT OF THE GUTTER AND HE WON'T LEAVE
US SO EASILY THOSE WERE HIS VERY WORDS
'THE IMPUDENT SCOUNDREL I CRIED
'I'VE NEVER SO MUCH AS SEEN HIM IN
MY LIFE
WHY SHOULD I CONSIDER HIM IN ANY WAY I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT
WRITE IF YOU WOULD RATHER I DIDN'T
'GOOD THAT'S A PROMISE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
'WELL I'M
DELIGHTED TO HAVE GOT SO GOOD A MAN FOR MY BROTHER
HERE'S YOUR ADVANCE
OF A HUNDRED POUNDS AND HERE IS THE LETTER
MAKE A NOTE OF THE ADDRESS
126B CORPORATION STREET AND REMEMBER THAT ONE O'CLOCK TO MORROW IS
YOUR APPOINTMENT
GOOD NIGHT AND MAY YOU HAVE ALL THE FORTUNE THAT YOU
DESERVE
THAT'S JUST ABOUT ALL THAT PASSED BETWEEN US AS NEAR AS I CAN
REMEMBER
YOU CAN IMAGINE DR
WATSON HOW PLEASED I WAS AT SUCH AN
EXTRAORDINARY BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE
I SAT UP HALF THE NIGHT HUGGING
MYSELF OVER IT AND NEXT DAY I WAS OFF TO BIRMINGHAM IN A TRAIN THAT
WOULD TAKE ME IN PLENTY TIME FOR MY APPOINTMENT
I TOOK MY THINGS TO
A HOTEL IN NEW STREET AND THEN I MADE MY WAY TO THE ADDRESS WHICH HAD
BEEN GIVEN ME
IT WAS A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE MY TIME BUT I THOUGHT THAT WOULD
MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
126B WAS A PASSAGE BETWEEN TWO LARGE SHOPS WHICH
LED TO A WINDING STONE STAIR FROM WHICH THERE WERE MANY FLATS LET AS
OFFICES TO COMPANIES OR PROFESSIONAL MEN
THE NAMES OF THE OCCUPANTS
WERE PAINTED AT THE BOTTOM ON THE WALL BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH NAME AS
THE FRANCO MIDLAND HARDWARE COMPANY LIMITED
I STOOD FOR A FEW MINUTES
WITH MY HEART IN MY BOOTS WONDERING WHETHER THE WHOLE THING WAS AN
ELABORATE HOAX OR NOT WHEN UP CAME A MAN AND ADDRESSED ME
HE WAS VERY
LIKE THE CHAP I HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SAME FIGURE AND VOICE
BUT HE WAS CLEAN SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR WAS LIGHTER
'ARE YOU MR
HALL PYCROFT HE ASKED
'YES SAID I
'OH I WAS EXPECTING YOU BUT YOU ARE A TRIFLE BEFORE YOUR TIME
I HAD
A NOTE FROM MY BROTHER THIS MORNING IN WHICH HE SANG YOUR PRAISES VERY
LOUDLY
'I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR THE OFFICES WHEN YOU CAME
'WE HAVE NOT GOT OUR NAME UP YET FOR WE ONLY SECURED THESE TEMPORARY
PREMISES LAST WEEK
COME UP WITH ME AND WE WILL TALK THE MATTER OVER
I FOLLOWED HIM TO THE TOP OF A VERY LOFTY STAIR AND THERE RIGHT UNDER
THE SLATES WERE A COUPLE OF EMPTY DUSTY LITTLE ROOMS UNCARPETED AND
UNCURTAINED INTO WHICH HE LED ME
I HAD THOUGHT OF A GREAT OFFICE WITH
SHINING TABLES AND ROWS OF CLERKS SUCH AS I WAS USED TO AND I DARE SAY
I STARED RATHER STRAIGHT AT THE TWO DEAL CHAIRS AND ONE LITTLE TABLE
WHICH WITH A LEDGER AND A WASTE PAPER BASKET MADE UP THE WHOLE
FURNITURE
'DON'T BE DISHEARTENED MR
PYCROFT SAID MY NEW ACQUAINTANCE SEEING
THE LENGTH OF MY FACE
'ROME WAS NOT BUILT IN A DAY AND WE HAVE LOTS OF
MONEY AT OUR BACKS THOUGH WE DON'T CUT MUCH DASH YET IN OFFICES
PRAY
SIT DOWN AND LET ME HAVE YOUR LETTER
I GAVE IT TO HIM AND HE READ IT OVER VERY CAREFULLY
'YOU SEEM TO HAVE MADE A VAST IMPRESSION UPON MY BROTHER ARTHUR SAID
HE 'AND I KNOW THAT HE IS A PRETTY SHREWD JUDGE
HE SWEARS BY LONDON
YOU KNOW AND I BY BIRMINGHAM BUT THIS TIME I SHALL FOLLOW HIS ADVICE
PRAY CONSIDER YOURSELF DEFINITELY ENGAGED
'WHAT ARE MY DUTIES I ASKED
'YOU WILL EVENTUALLY MANAGE THE GREAT DEPOT IN PARIS WHICH WILL POUR
A FLOOD OF ENGLISH CROCKERY INTO THE SHOPS OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR
AGENTS IN FRANCE
THE PURCHASE WILL BE COMPLETED IN A WEEK AND
MEANWHILE YOU WILL REMAIN IN BIRMINGHAM AND MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL
'HOW
FOR ANSWER HE TOOK A BIG RED BOOK OUT OF A DRAWER
'THIS IS A DIRECTORY OF PARIS SAID HE 'WITH THE TRADES AFTER THE
NAMES OF THE PEOPLE
I WANT YOU TO TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU AND TO MARK
OFF ALL THE HARDWARE SELLERS WITH THEIR ADDRESSES
IT WOULD BE OF THE
GREATEST USE TO ME TO HAVE THEM
'SURELY THERE ARE CLASSIFIED LISTS I SUGGESTED
'NOT RELIABLE ONES
THEIR SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM OURS
STICK AT IT
AND LET ME HAVE THE LISTS BY MONDAY AT TWELVE
GOOD DAY MR
PYCROFT
IF YOU CONTINUE TO SHOW ZEAL AND INTELLIGENCE YOU WILL FIND THE COMPANY
A GOOD MASTER
I WENT BACK TO THE HOTEL WITH THE BIG BOOK UNDER MY ARM AND WITH VERY
CONFLICTING FEELINGS IN MY BREAST
ON THE ONE HAND I WAS DEFINITELY
ENGAGED AND HAD A HUNDRED POUNDS IN MY POCKET ON THE OTHER THE LOOK
OF THE OFFICES THE ABSENCE OF NAME ON THE WALL AND OTHER OF THE POINTS
WHICH WOULD STRIKE A BUSINESS MAN HAD LEFT A BAD IMPRESSION AS TO THE
POSITION OF MY EMPLOYERS
HOWEVER COME WHAT MIGHT I HAD MY MONEY SO I
SETTLED DOWN TO MY TASK
ALL SUNDAY I WAS KEPT HARD AT WORK AND YET BY
MONDAY I HAD ONLY GOT AS FAR AS H
I WENT ROUND TO MY EMPLOYER FOUND
HIM IN THE SAME DISMANTLED KIND OF ROOM AND WAS TOLD TO KEEP AT
IT UNTIL WEDNESDAY AND THEN COME AGAIN
ON WEDNESDAY IT WAS STILL
UNFINISHED SO I HAMMERED AWAY UNTIL FRIDAY THAT IS YESTERDAY
THEN I
BROUGHT IT ROUND TO MR
HARRY PINNER
'THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAID HE 'I FEAR THAT I UNDERRATED THE
DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK
THIS LIST WILL BE OF VERY MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO
ME
'IT TOOK SOME TIME SAID I
'AND NOW SAID HE 'I WANT YOU TO MAKE A LIST OF THE FURNITURE SHOPS
FOR THEY ALL SELL CROCKERY
'VERY GOOD
'AND YOU CAN COME UP TO MORROW EVENING AT SEVEN AND LET ME KNOW HOW
YOU ARE GETTING ON
DON'T OVERWORK YOURSELF
A COUPLE OF HOURS AT DAY'S
MUSIC HALL IN THE EVENING WOULD DO YOU NO HARM AFTER YOUR LABORS HE
LAUGHED AS HE SPOKE AND I SAW WITH A THRILL THAT HIS SECOND TOOTH UPON
THE LEFT HAND SIDE HAD BEEN VERY BADLY STUFFED WITH GOLD
SHERLOCK HOLMES RUBBED HIS HANDS WITH DELIGHT AND I STARED WITH
ASTONISHMENT AT OUR CLIENT
YOU MAY WELL LOOK SURPRISED DR
WATSON BUT IT IS THIS WAY SAID HE
WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO THE OTHER CHAP IN LONDON AT THE TIME THAT HE
LAUGHED AT MY NOT GOING TO MAWSON'S I HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT HIS TOOTH
WAS STUFFED IN THIS VERY IDENTICAL FASHION
THE GLINT OF THE GOLD IN
EACH CASE CAUGHT MY EYE YOU SEE
WHEN I PUT THAT WITH THE VOICE AND
FIGURE BEING THE SAME AND ONLY THOSE THINGS ALTERED WHICH MIGHT BE
CHANGED BY A RAZOR OR A WIG I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT IT WAS THE SAME MAN
OF COURSE YOU EXPECT TWO BROTHERS TO BE ALIKE BUT NOT THAT THEY SHOULD
HAVE THE SAME TOOTH STUFFED IN THE SAME WAY
HE BOWED ME OUT AND I
FOUND MYSELF IN THE STREET HARDLY KNOWING WHETHER I WAS ON MY HEAD OR
MY HEELS
BACK I WENT TO MY HOTEL PUT MY HEAD IN A BASIN OF COLD WATER
AND TRIED TO THINK IT OUT
WHY HAD HE SENT ME FROM LONDON TO BIRMINGHAM
WHY HAD HE GOT THERE BEFORE ME AND WHY HAD HE WRITTEN A LETTER FROM
HIMSELF TO HIMSELF IT WAS ALTOGETHER TOO MUCH FOR ME AND I COULD MAKE
NO SENSE OF IT
AND THEN SUDDENLY IT STRUCK ME THAT WHAT WAS DARK TO ME
MIGHT BE VERY LIGHT TO MR
SHERLOCK HOLMES
I HAD JUST TIME TO GET UP TO
TOWN BY THE NIGHT TRAIN TO SEE HIM THIS MORNING AND TO BRING YOU BOTH
BACK WITH ME TO BIRMINGHAM
THERE WAS A PAUSE AFTER THE STOCK BROKER'S CLERK HAD CONCLUDED HIS
SURPRISING EXPERIENCE
THEN SHERLOCK HOLMES COCKED HIS EYE AT ME
LEANING BACK ON THE CUSHIONS WITH A PLEASED AND YET CRITICAL FACE LIKE
A CONNOISSEUR WHO HAS JUST TAKEN HIS FIRST SIP OF A COMET VINTAGE
RATHER FINE WATSON IS IT NOT SAID HE
THERE ARE POINTS IN IT WHICH
PLEASE ME
I THINK THAT YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT AN INTERVIEW WITH
MR
ARTHUR HARRY PINNER IN THE TEMPORARY OFFICES OF THE FRANCO MIDLAND
HARDWARE COMPANY LIMITED WOULD BE A RATHER INTERESTING EXPERIENCE FOR
BOTH OF US
BUT HOW CAN WE DO IT I ASKED
OH EASILY ENOUGH SAID HALL PYCROFT CHEERILY
YOU ARE TWO FRIENDS
OF MINE WHO ARE IN WANT OF A BILLET AND WHAT COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN
THAT I SHOULD BRING YOU BOTH ROUND TO THE MANAGING DIRECTOR
QUITE SO OF COURSE SAID HOLMES
I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK AT
THE GENTLEMAN AND SEE IF I CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF HIS LITTLE GAME
WHAT QUALITIES HAVE YOU MY FRIEND WHICH WOULD MAKE YOUR SERVICES
SO VALUABLE OR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE BEGAN BITING HIS NAILS AND
STARING BLANKLY OUT OF THE WINDOW AND WE HARDLY DREW ANOTHER WORD FROM
HIM UNTIL WE WERE IN NEW STREET
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING WE WERE WALKING THE THREE OF US DOWN
CORPORATION STREET TO THE COMPANY'S OFFICES
IT IS NO USE OUR BEING AT ALL BEFORE OUR TIME SAID OUR CLIENT
HE
ONLY COMES THERE TO SEE ME APPARENTLY FOR THE PLACE IS DESERTED UP TO
THE VERY HOUR HE NAMES
THAT IS SUGGESTIVE REMARKED HOLMES
BY JOVE I TOLD YOU SO CRIED THE CLERK
THAT'S HE WALKING AHEAD OF
US THERE
HE POINTED TO A SMALLISH DARK WELL DRESSED MAN WHO WAS BUSTLING ALONG
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD
AS WE WATCHED HIM HE LOOKED ACROSS AT A BOY
WHO WAS BAWLING OUT THE LATEST EDITION OF THE EVENING PAPER AND RUNNING
OVER AMONG THE CABS AND BUSSES HE BOUGHT ONE FROM HIM
THEN CLUTCHING
IT IN HIS HAND HE VANISHED THROUGH A DOOR WAY
THERE HE GOES CRIED HALL PYCROFT
THESE ARE THE COMPANY'S OFFICES
INTO WHICH HE HAS GONE
COME WITH ME AND I'LL FIX IT UP AS EASILY AS
POSSIBLE
FOLLOWING HIS LEAD WE ASCENDED FIVE STORIES UNTIL WE FOUND OURSELVES
OUTSIDE A HALF OPENED DOOR AT WHICH OUR CLIENT TAPPED
A VOICE WITHIN
BADE US ENTER AND WE ENTERED A BARE UNFURNISHED ROOM SUCH AS HALL
PYCROFT HAD DESCRIBED
AT THE SINGLE TABLE SAT THE MAN WHOM WE HAD SEEN
IN THE STREET WITH HIS EVENING PAPER SPREAD OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND AS
HE LOOKED UP AT US IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NEVER LOOKED UPON A FACE
WHICH BORE SUCH MARKS OF GRIEF AND OF SOMETHING BEYOND GRIEF OF A
HORROR SUCH AS COMES TO FEW MEN IN A LIFETIME
HIS BROW GLISTENED WITH
PERSPIRATION HIS CHEEKS WERE OF THE DULL DEAD WHITE OF A FISH'S BELLY
AND HIS EYES WERE WILD AND STARING
HE LOOKED AT HIS CLERK AS THOUGH HE
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE HIM AND I COULD SEE BY THE ASTONISHMENT DEPICTED
UPON OUR CONDUCTOR'S FACE THAT THIS WAS BY NO MEANS THE USUAL APPEARANCE
OF HIS EMPLOYER
YOU LOOK ILL MR
PINNER HE EXCLAIMED
YES I AM NOT VERY WELL ANSWERED THE OTHER MAKING OBVIOUS EFFORTS
TO PULL HIMSELF TOGETHER AND LICKING HIS DRY LIPS BEFORE HE SPOKE
WHO
ARE THESE GENTLEMEN WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT WITH YOU
ONE IS MR
HARRIS OF BERMONDSEY AND THE OTHER IS MR
PRICE OF THIS
TOWN SAID OUR CLERK GLIBLY
THEY ARE FRIENDS OF MINE AND GENTLEMEN
OF EXPERIENCE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN OUT OF A PLACE FOR SOME LITTLE TIME
AND THEY HOPED THAT PERHAPS YOU MIGHT FIND AN OPENING FOR THEM IN THE
COMPANY'S EMPLOYMENT
VERY POSSIBLY VERY POSSIBLY CRIED MR
PINNER WITH A GHASTLY SMILE
YES I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU
WHAT IS YOUR PARTICULAR LINE MR
HARRIS
I AM AN ACCOUNTANT SAID HOLMES
AH YES WE SHALL WANT SOMETHING OF THE SORT
AND YOU MR
PRICE
A CLERK SAID I
I HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT THE COMPANY MAY ACCOMMODATE YOU
I WILL LET YOU
KNOW ABOUT IT AS SOON AS WE COME TO ANY CONCLUSION
AND NOW I BEG THAT
YOU WILL GO
FOR GOD'S SAKE LEAVE ME TO MYSELF
THESE LAST WORDS WERE SHOT OUT OF HIM AS THOUGH THE CONSTRAINT WHICH
HE WAS EVIDENTLY SETTING UPON HIMSELF HAD SUDDENLY AND UTTERLY BURST
ASUNDER
HOLMES AND I GLANCED AT EACH OTHER AND HALL PYCROFT TOOK A
STEP TOWARDS THE TABLE
YOU FORGET MR
PINNER THAT I AM HERE BY APPOINTMENT TO RECEIVE SOME
DIRECTIONS FROM YOU SAID HE
CERTAINLY MR
PYCROFT CERTAINLY THE OTHER RESUMED IN A CALMER TONE
YOU MAY WAIT HERE A MOMENT AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOUR FRIENDS
SHOULD NOT WAIT WITH YOU
I WILL BE ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE IN THREE
MINUTES IF I MIGHT TRESPASS UPON YOUR PATIENCE SO FAR HE ROSE WITH A
VERY COURTEOUS AIR AND BOWING TO US HE PASSED OUT THROUGH A DOOR AT
THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHICH HE CLOSED BEHIND HIM
WHAT NOW WHISPERED HOLMES
IS HE GIVING US THE SLIP
IMPOSSIBLE ANSWERED PYCROFT
WHY SO
THAT DOOR LEADS INTO AN INNER ROOM
THERE IS NO EXIT
NONE
IS IT FURNISHED
IT WAS EMPTY YESTERDAY
THEN WHAT ON EARTH CAN HE BE DOING THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH I DON'T
UNDERSTAND IN THIS MANNER
IF EVER A MAN WAS THREE PARTS MAD WITH
TERROR THAT MAN'S NAME IS PINNER
WHAT CAN HAVE PUT THE SHIVERS ON
HIM
HE SUSPECTS THAT WE ARE DETECTIVES I SUGGESTED
THAT'S IT CRIED PYCROFT
HOLMES SHOOK HIS HEAD
HE DID NOT TURN PALE
HE WAS PALE WHEN WE
ENTERED THE ROOM SAID HE
IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT
HIS WORDS WERE INTERRUPTED BY A SHARP RAT TAT FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE
INNER DOOR
WHAT THE DEUCE IS HE KNOCKING AT HIS OWN DOOR FOR CRIED THE CLERK
AGAIN AND MUCH LOUDER CAME THE RAT TAT TAT
WE ALL GAZED EXPECTANTLY AT
THE CLOSED DOOR
GLANCING AT HOLMES I SAW HIS FACE TURN RIGID AND HE
LEANED FORWARD IN INTENSE EXCITEMENT
THEN SUDDENLY CAME A LOW GUGGLING
GARGLING SOUND AND A BRISK DRUMMING UPON WOODWORK
HOLMES SPRANG
FRANTICALLY ACROSS THE ROOM AND PUSHED AT THE DOOR
IT WAS FASTENED ON
THE INNER SIDE
FOLLOWING HIS EXAMPLE WE THREW OURSELVES UPON IT WITH
ALL OUR WEIGHT
ONE HINGE SNAPPED THEN THE OTHER AND DOWN CAME THE
DOOR WITH A CRASH
RUSHING OVER IT WE FOUND OURSELVES IN THE INNER
ROOM
IT WAS EMPTY
BUT IT WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT THAT WE WERE AT FAULT
AT ONE CORNER THE
CORNER NEAREST THE ROOM WHICH WE HAD LEFT THERE WAS A SECOND DOOR
HOLMES SPRANG TO IT AND PULLED IT OPEN
A COAT AND WAISTCOAT WERE LYING
ON THE FLOOR AND FROM A HOOK BEHIND THE DOOR WITH HIS OWN BRACES
ROUND HIS NECK WAS HANGING THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE FRANCO MIDLAND
HARDWARE COMPANY
HIS KNEES WERE DRAWN UP HIS HEAD HUNG AT A DREADFUL
ANGLE TO HIS BODY AND THE CLATTER OF HIS HEELS AGAINST THE DOOR MADE
THE NOISE WHICH HAD BROKEN IN UPON OUR CONVERSATION
IN AN INSTANT I
HAD CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST AND HELD HIM UP WHILE HOLMES AND PYCROFT
UNTIED THE ELASTIC BANDS WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED BETWEEN THE LIVID CREASES
OF SKIN
THEN WE CARRIED HIM INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE HE LAY WITH
A CLAY COLORED FACE PUFFING HIS PURPLE LIPS IN AND OUT WITH EVERY
BREATH A DREADFUL WRECK OF ALL THAT HE HAD BEEN BUT FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIM WATSON ASKED HOLMES
I STOOPED OVER HIM AND EXAMINED HIM
HIS PULSE WAS FEEBLE AND
INTERMITTENT BUT HIS BREATHING GREW LONGER AND THERE WAS A LITTLE
SHIVERING OF HIS EYELIDS WHICH SHOWED A THIN WHITE SLIT OF BALL
BENEATH
IT HAS BEEN TOUCH AND GO WITH HIM SAID I BUT HE'LL LIVE NOW
JUST
OPEN THAT WINDOW AND HAND ME THE WATER CARAFE I UNDID HIS COLLAR
POURED THE COLD WATER OVER HIS FACE AND RAISED AND SANK HIS ARMS UNTIL
HE DREW A LONG NATURAL BREATH
IT'S ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME NOW SAID
I AS I TURNED AWAY FROM HIM
HOLMES STOOD BY THE TABLE WITH HIS HANDS DEEP IN HIS TROUSER'S POCKETS
AND HIS CHIN UPON HIS BREAST
I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO CALL THE POLICE IN NOW SAID HE
AND YET I
CONFESS THAT I'D LIKE TO GIVE THEM A COMPLETE CASE WHEN THEY COME
IT'S A BLESSED MYSTERY TO ME CRIED PYCROFT SCRATCHING HIS HEAD
WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO BRING ME ALL THE WAY UP HERE FOR AND THEN
POOH ALL THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH SAID HOLMES IMPATIENTLY
IT IS THIS
LAST SUDDEN MOVE
YOU UNDERSTAND THE REST THEN
I THINK THAT IT IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS
WHAT DO YOU SAY WATSON
I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS
I MUST CONFESS THAT I AM OUT OF MY DEPTHS
SAID I
OH SURELY IF YOU CONSIDER THE EVENTS AT FIRST THEY CAN ONLY POINT TO
ONE CONCLUSION
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THEM
WELL THE WHOLE THING HINGES UPON TWO POINTS
THE FIRST IS THE MAKING
OF PYCROFT WRITE A DECLARATION BY WHICH HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THIS
PREPOSTEROUS COMPANY
DO YOU NOT SEE HOW VERY SUGGESTIVE THAT IS
I AM AFRAID I MISS THE POINT
WELL WHY DID THEY WANT HIM TO DO IT NOT AS A BUSINESS MATTER FOR
THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE USUALLY VERBAL AND THERE WAS NO EARTHLY BUSINESS
REASON WHY THIS SHOULD BE AN EXCEPTION
DON'T YOU SEE MY YOUNG FRIEND
THAT THEY WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN A SPECIMEN OF YOUR HANDWRITING
AND HAD NO OTHER WAY OF DOING IT
AND WHY
QUITE SO
WHY WHEN WE ANSWER THAT WE HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS WITH OUR
LITTLE PROBLEM
WHY THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE ADEQUATE REASON
SOME ONE
WANTED TO LEARN TO IMITATE YOUR WRITING AND HAD TO PROCURE A SPECIMEN
OF IT FIRST
AND NOW IF WE PASS ON TO THE SECOND POINT WE FIND THAT EACH
THROWS LIGHT UPON THE OTHER
THAT POINT IS THE REQUEST MADE BY PINNER
THAT YOU SHOULD NOT RESIGN YOUR PLACE BUT SHOULD LEAVE THE MANAGER OF
THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS IN THE FULL EXPECTATION THAT A MR
HALL PYCROFT
WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE OFFICE UPON THE MONDAY
MORNING
MY GOD CRIED OUR CLIENT WHAT A BLIND BEETLE I HAVE BEEN
NOW YOU SEE THE POINT ABOUT THE HANDWRITING
SUPPOSE THAT SOME ONE
TURNED UP IN YOUR PLACE WHO WROTE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT HAND FROM THAT
IN WHICH YOU HAD APPLIED FOR THE VACANCY OF COURSE THE GAME WOULD HAVE
BEEN UP
BUT IN THE INTERVAL THE ROGUE HAD LEARNED TO IMITATE YOU
AND HIS POSITION WAS THEREFORE SECURE AS I PRESUME THAT NOBODY IN THE
OFFICE HAD EVER SET EYES UPON YOU
NOT A SOUL GROANED HALL PYCROFT
VERY GOOD
OF COURSE IT WAS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO PREVENT YOU
FROM THINKING BETTER OF IT AND ALSO TO KEEP YOU FROM COMING INTO
CONTACT WITH ANY ONE WHO MIGHT TELL YOU THAT YOUR DOUBLE WAS AT WORK
IN MAWSON'S OFFICE
THEREFORE THEY GAVE YOU A HANDSOME ADVANCE ON YOUR
SALARY AND RAN YOU OFF TO THE MIDLANDS WHERE THEY GAVE YOU ENOUGH WORK
TO DO TO PREVENT YOUR GOING TO LONDON WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE BURST THEIR
LITTLE GAME UP
THAT IS ALL PLAIN ENOUGH
BUT WHY SHOULD THIS MAN PRETEND TO BE HIS OWN BROTHER
WELL THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO
THERE ARE EVIDENTLY ONLY TWO OF THEM
IN IT
THE OTHER IS IMPERSONATING YOU AT THE OFFICE
THIS ONE ACTED
AS YOUR ENGAGER AND THEN FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT FIND YOU AN EMPLOYER
WITHOUT ADMITTING A THIRD PERSON INTO HIS PLOT
THAT HE WAS MOST
UNWILLING TO DO
HE CHANGED HIS APPEARANCE AS FAR AS HE COULD AND
TRUSTED THAT THE LIKENESS WHICH YOU COULD NOT FAIL TO OBSERVE WOULD BE
PUT DOWN TO A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE
BUT FOR THE HAPPY CHANCE OF THE GOLD
STUFFING YOUR SUSPICIONS WOULD PROBABLY NEVER HAVE BEEN AROUSED
HALL PYCROFT SHOOK HIS CLINCHED HANDS IN THE AIR
GOOD LORD HE CRIED
WHILE I HAVE BEEN FOOLED IN THIS WAY WHAT HAS THIS OTHER HALL PYCROFT
BEEN DOING AT MAWSON'S WHAT SHOULD WE DO MR
HOLMES TELL ME WHAT TO
DO
WE MUST WIRE TO MAWSON'S
THEY SHUT AT TWELVE ON SATURDAYS
NEVER MIND
THERE MAY BE SOME DOOR KEEPER OR ATTENDANT
AH YES THEY KEEP A PERMANENT GUARD THERE ON ACCOUNT OF THE VALUE OF
THE SECURITIES THAT THEY HOLD
I REMEMBER HEARING IT TALKED OF IN THE
CITY
VERY GOOD WE SHALL WIRE TO HIM AND SEE IF ALL IS WELL AND IF A CLERK
OF YOUR NAME IS WORKING THERE
THAT IS CLEAR ENOUGH BUT WHAT IS NOT SO
CLEAR IS WHY AT SIGHT OF US ONE OF THE ROGUES SHOULD INSTANTLY WALK OUT
OF THE ROOM AND HANG HIMSELF
THE PAPER CROAKED A VOICE BEHIND US
THE MAN WAS SITTING UP BLANCHED
AND GHASTLY WITH RETURNING REASON IN HIS EYES AND HANDS WHICH RUBBED
NERVOUSLY AT THE BROAD RED BAND WHICH STILL ENCIRCLED HIS THROAT
THE PAPER OF COURSE YELLED HOLMES IN A PAROXYSM OF EXCITEMENT
IDIOT THAT I WAS I THOUGHT SO MUCH OF OUR VISIT THAT THE PAPER NEVER
ENTERED MY HEAD FOR AN INSTANT
TO BE SURE THE SECRET MUST BE THERE
HE FLATTENED IT OUT UPON THE TABLE AND A CRY OF TRIUMPH BURST FROM HIS
LIPS
LOOK AT THIS WATSON HE CRIED
IT IS A LONDON PAPER AN EARLY
EDITION OF THE EVENING STANDARD
HERE IS WHAT WE WANT
LOOK AT THE
HEADLINES 'CRIME IN THE CITY
MURDER AT MAWSON WILLIAMS'S
GIGANTIC
ATTEMPTED ROBBERY
CAPTURE OF THE CRIMINAL HERE WATSON WE ARE ALL
EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO HEAR IT SO KINDLY READ IT ALOUD TO US
IT APPEARED FROM ITS POSITION IN THE PAPER TO HAVE BEEN THE ONE EVENT OF
IMPORTANCE IN TOWN AND THE ACCOUNT OF IT RAN IN THIS WAY
A DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY CULMINATING IN THE DEATH OF ONE MAN AND
THE CAPTURE OF THE CRIMINAL OCCURRED THIS AFTERNOON IN THE CITY
FOR
SOME TIME BACK MAWSON WILLIAMS THE FAMOUS FINANCIAL HOUSE HAVE BEEN
THE GUARDIANS OF SECURITIES WHICH AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE TO A SUM OF
CONSIDERABLY OVER A MILLION STERLING
SO CONSCIOUS WAS THE MANAGER OF
THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH DEVOLVED UPON HIM IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE GREAT
INTERESTS AT STAKE THAT SAFES OF THE VERY LATEST CONSTRUCTION HAVE
BEEN EMPLOYED AND AN ARMED WATCHMAN HAS BEEN LEFT DAY AND NIGHT IN THE
BUILDING
IT APPEARS THAT LAST WEEK A NEW CLERK NAMED HALL PYCROFT WAS
ENGAGED BY THE FIRM
THIS PERSON APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN NONE OTHER THAN
BEDDINGTON THE FAMOUS FORGER AND CRACKSMAN WHO WITH HIS BROTHER HAD
ONLY RECENTLY EMERGED FROM A FIVE YEARS' SPELL OF PENAL SERVITUDE
BY
SOME MEANS WHICH ARE NOT YET CLEAR HE SUCCEEDED IN WINNING UNDER A
FALSE NAME THIS OFFICIAL POSITION IN THE OFFICE WHICH HE UTILIZED IN
ORDER TO OBTAIN MOULDING OF VARIOUS LOCKS AND A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF
THE POSITION OF THE STRONG ROOM AND THE SAFES
IT IS CUSTOMARY AT MAWSON'S FOR THE CLERKS TO LEAVE AT MIDDAY ON
SATURDAY
SERGEANT TUSON OF THE CITY POLICE WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED
THEREFORE TO SEE A GENTLEMAN WITH A CARPET BAG COME DOWN THE STEPS AT
TWENTY MINUTES PAST ONE
HIS SUSPICIONS BEING AROUSED THE SERGEANT
FOLLOWED THE MAN AND WITH THE AID OF CONSTABLE POLLOCK SUCCEEDED AFTER
A MOST DESPERATE RESISTANCE IN ARRESTING HIM
IT WAS AT ONCE CLEAR
THAT A DARING AND GIGANTIC ROBBERY HAD BEEN COMMITTED
NEARLY A HUNDRED
THOUSAND POUNDS' WORTH OF AMERICAN RAILWAY BONDS WITH A LARGE AMOUNT
OF SCRIP IN MINES AND OTHER COMPANIES WAS DISCOVERED IN THE BAG
ON
EXAMINING THE PREMISES THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE WATCHMAN WAS FOUND
DOUBLED UP AND THRUST INTO THE LARGEST OF THE SAFES WHERE IT WOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED UNTIL MONDAY MORNING HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE PROMPT
ACTION OF SERGEANT TUSON
THE MAN'S SKULL HAD BEEN SHATTERED BY A
BLOW FROM A POKER DELIVERED FROM BEHIND
THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
THAT BEDDINGTON HAD OBTAINED ENTRANCE BY PRETENDING THAT HE HAD LEFT
SOMETHING BEHIND HIM AND HAVING MURDERED THE WATCHMAN RAPIDLY RIFLED
THE LARGE SAFE AND THEN MADE OFF WITH HIS BOOTY
HIS BROTHER WHO
USUALLY WORKS WITH HIM HAS NOT APPEARED IN THIS JOB AS FAR AS CAN
AT PRESENT BE ASCERTAINED ALTHOUGH THE POLICE ARE MAKING ENERGETIC
INQUIRIES AS TO HIS WHEREABOUTS
WELL WE MAY SAVE THE POLICE SOME LITTLE TROUBLE IN THAT DIRECTION
SAID HOLMES GLANCING AT THE HAGGARD FIGURE HUDDLED UP BY THE WINDOW
HUMAN NATURE IS A STRANGE MIXTURE WATSON
YOU SEE THAT EVEN A VILLAIN
AND MURDERER CAN INSPIRE SUCH AFFECTION THAT HIS BROTHER TURNS TO
SUICIDE WHEN HE LEARNS THAT HIS NECK IS FORFEITED
HOWEVER WE HAVE
NO CHOICE AS TO OUR ACTION
THE DOCTOR AND I WILL REMAIN ON GUARD MR
PYCROFT IF YOU WILL HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP OUT FOR THE POLICE
ADVENTURE IV
THE GLORIA SCOTT
I HAVE SOME PAPERS HERE SAID MY FRIEND SHERLOCK HOLMES AS WE SAT
ONE WINTER'S NIGHT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIRE WHICH I REALLY THINK
WATSON THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH YOUR WHILE TO GLANCE OVER
THESE ARE THE
DOCUMENTS IN THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF THE GLORIA SCOTT AND THIS IS THE
MESSAGE WHICH STRUCK JUSTICE OF THE PEACE TREVOR DEAD WITH HORROR WHEN
HE READ IT
HE HAD PICKED FROM A DRAWER A LITTLE TARNISHED CYLINDER AND UNDOING
THE TAPE HE HANDED ME A SHORT NOTE SCRAWLED UPON A HALF SHEET OF
SLATE GRAY PAPER
THE SUPPLY OF GAME FOR LONDON IS GOING STEADILY UP IT RAN
HEAD KEEPER HUDSON WE BELIEVE HAS BEEN NOW TOLD TO RECEIVE ALL ORDERS
FOR FLY PAPER AND FOR PRESERVATION OF YOUR HEN PHEASANT'S LIFE
AS I GLANCED UP FROM READING THIS ENIGMATICAL MESSAGE I SAW HOLMES
CHUCKLING AT THE EXPRESSION UPON MY FACE
YOU LOOK A LITTLE BEWILDERED SAID HE
I CANNOT SEE HOW SUCH A MESSAGE AS THIS COULD INSPIRE HORROR
IT SEEMS
TO ME TO BE RATHER GROTESQUE THAN OTHERWISE
VERY LIKELY
YET THE FACT REMAINS THAT THE READER WHO WAS A FINE
ROBUST OLD MAN WAS KNOCKED CLEAN DOWN BY IT AS IF IT HAD BEEN THE BUTT
END OF A PISTOL
YOU AROUSE MY CURIOSITY SAID I
BUT WHY DID YOU SAY JUST NOW THAT
THERE WERE VERY PARTICULAR REASONS WHY I SHOULD STUDY THIS CASE
BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST IN WHICH I WAS EVER ENGAGED
I HAD OFTEN ENDEAVORED TO ELICIT FROM MY COMPANION WHAT HAD FIRST TURNED
HIS MIND IN THE DIRECTION OF CRIMINAL RESEARCH BUT HAD NEVER CAUGHT HIM
BEFORE IN A COMMUNICATIVE HUMOR
NOW HE SAT FORWARD IN THIS ARM CHAIR
AND SPREAD OUT THE DOCUMENTS UPON HIS KNEES
THEN HE LIT HIS PIPE AND
SAT FOR SOME TIME SMOKING AND TURNING THEM OVER
YOU NEVER HEARD ME TALK OF VICTOR TREVOR HE ASKED
HE WAS THE ONLY
FRIEND I MADE DURING THE TWO YEARS I WAS AT COLLEGE
I WAS NEVER A VERY
SOCIABLE FELLOW WATSON ALWAYS RATHER FOND OF MOPING IN MY ROOMS AND
WORKING OUT MY OWN LITTLE METHODS OF THOUGHT SO THAT I NEVER MIXED
MUCH WITH THE MEN OF MY YEAR
BAR FENCING AND BOXING I HAD FEW ATHLETIC
TASTES AND THEN MY LINE OF STUDY WAS QUITE DISTINCT FROM THAT OF THE
OTHER FELLOWS SO THAT WE HAD NO POINTS OF CONTACT AT ALL
TREVOR WAS
THE ONLY MAN I KNEW AND THAT ONLY THROUGH THE ACCIDENT OF HIS BULL
TERRIER FREEZING ON TO MY ANKLE ONE MORNING AS I WENT DOWN TO CHAPEL
IT WAS A PROSAIC WAY OF FORMING A FRIENDSHIP BUT IT WAS EFFECTIVE
I WAS LAID BY THE HEELS FOR TEN DAYS BUT TREVOR USED TO COME IN TO
INQUIRE AFTER ME
AT FIRST IT WAS ONLY A MINUTE'S CHAT BUT SOON HIS
VISITS LENGTHENED AND BEFORE THE END OF THE TERM WE WERE CLOSE FRIENDS
HE WAS A HEARTY FULL BLOODED FELLOW FULL OF SPIRITS AND ENERGY
THE VERY OPPOSITE TO ME IN MOST RESPECTS BUT WE HAD SOME SUBJECTS
IN COMMON AND IT WAS A BOND OF UNION WHEN I FOUND THAT HE WAS AS
FRIENDLESS AS I
FINALLY HE INVITED ME DOWN TO HIS FATHER'S PLACE AT
DONNITHORPE IN NORFOLK AND I ACCEPTED HIS HOSPITALITY FOR A MONTH OF
THE LONG VACATION
OLD TREVOR WAS EVIDENTLY A MAN OF SOME WEALTH AND CONSIDERATION A
J P AND A LANDED PROPRIETOR
DONNITHORPE IS A LITTLE HAMLET JUST TO
THE NORTH OF LANGMERE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE BROADS
THE HOUSE WAS
AN OLD FASHIONED WIDE SPREAD OAK BEAMED BRICK BUILDING WITH A FINE
LIME LINED AVENUE LEADING UP TO IT
THERE WAS EXCELLENT WILD DUCK
SHOOTING IN THE FENS REMARKABLY GOOD FISHING A SMALL BUT SELECT
LIBRARY TAKEN OVER AS I UNDERSTOOD FROM A FORMER OCCUPANT AND A
TOLERABLE COOK SO THAT HE WOULD BE A FASTIDIOUS MAN WHO COULD NOT PUT
IN A PLEASANT MONTH THERE
TREVOR SENIOR WAS A WIDOWER AND MY FRIEND HIS ONLY SON
THERE HAD BEEN A DAUGHTER I HEARD BUT SHE HAD DIED OF DIPHTHERIA
WHILE ON A VISIT TO BIRMINGHAM
THE FATHER INTERESTED ME EXTREMELY
HE WAS A MAN OF LITTLE CULTURE BUT WITH A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RUDE
STRENGTH BOTH PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY
HE KNEW HARDLY ANY BOOKS BUT
HE HAD TRAVELED FAR HAD SEEN MUCH OF THE WORLD
AND HAD REMEMBERED
ALL THAT HE HAD LEARNED
IN PERSON HE WAS A THICK SET BURLY MAN WITH
A SHOCK OF GRIZZLED HAIR A BROWN WEATHER BEATEN FACE AND BLUE EYES
WHICH WERE KEEN TO THE VERGE OF FIERCENESS
YET HE HAD A REPUTATION FOR
KINDNESS AND CHARITY ON THE COUNTRY SIDE AND WAS NOTED FOR THE LENIENCY
OF HIS SENTENCES FROM THE BENCH
ONE EVENING SHORTLY AFTER MY ARRIVAL WE WERE SITTING OVER A GLASS OF
PORT AFTER DINNER WHEN YOUNG TREVOR BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT THOSE HABITS
OF OBSERVATION AND INFERENCE WHICH I HAD ALREADY FORMED INTO A SYSTEM
ALTHOUGH I HAD NOT YET APPRECIATED THE PART WHICH THEY WERE TO PLAY IN
MY LIFE
THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY THOUGHT THAT HIS SON WAS EXAGGERATING IN
HIS DESCRIPTION OF ONE OR TWO TRIVIAL FEATS WHICH I HAD PERFORMED
'COME NOW MR
HOLMES SAID HE LAUGHING GOOD HUMOREDLY
'I'M AN
EXCELLENT SUBJECT IF YOU CAN DEDUCE ANYTHING FROM ME
'I FEAR THERE IS NOT VERY MUCH I ANSWERED 'I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT
YOU HAVE GONE ABOUT IN FEAR OF SOME PERSONAL ATTACK WITHIN THE LAST
TWELVEMONTH
THE LAUGH FADED FROM HIS LIPS AND HE STARED AT ME IN GREAT SURPRISE
'WELL THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH SAID HE
'YOU KNOW VICTOR TURNING TO HIS
SON 'WHEN WE BROKE UP THAT POACHING GANG THEY SWORE TO KNIFE US AND
SIR EDWARD HOLLY HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ATTACKED
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ON MY
GUARD SINCE THEN THOUGH I HAVE NO IDEA HOW YOU KNOW IT
'YOU HAVE A VERY HANDSOME STICK I ANSWERED
'BY THE INSCRIPTION I
OBSERVED THAT YOU HAD NOT HAD IT MORE THAN A YEAR
BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN
SOME PAINS TO BORE THE HEAD OF IT AND POUR MELTED LEAD INTO THE HOLE SO
AS TO MAKE IT A FORMIDABLE WEAPON
I ARGUED THAT YOU WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH
PRECAUTIONS UNLESS YOU HAD SOME DANGER TO FEAR
'ANYTHING ELSE HE ASKED SMILING
'YOU HAVE BOXED A GOOD DEAL IN YOUR YOUTH
'RIGHT AGAIN
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT IS MY NOSE KNOCKED A LITTLE OUT OF
THE STRAIGHT
'NO SAID I
'IT IS YOUR EARS
THEY HAVE THE PECULIAR FLATTENING AND
THICKENING WHICH MARKS THE BOXING MAN
'ANYTHING ELSE
'YOU HAVE DONE A GOOD DEAL OF DIGGING BY YOUR CALLOSITIES
'MADE ALL MY MONEY AT THE GOLD FIELDS
'YOU HAVE BEEN IN NEW ZEALAND
'RIGHT AGAIN
'YOU HAVE VISITED JAPAN
'QUITE TRUE
'AND YOU HAVE BEEN MOST INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH SOME ONE WHOSE
INITIALS WERE J
A AND WHOM YOU AFTERWARDS WERE EAGER TO ENTIRELY
FORGET
MR
TREVOR STOOD SLOWLY UP FIXED HIS LARGE BLUE EYES UPON ME WITH A
STRANGE WILD STARE AND THEN PITCHED FORWARD WITH HIS FACE AMONG THE
NUTSHELLS WHICH STREWED THE CLOTH IN A DEAD FAINT
YOU CAN IMAGINE WATSON HOW SHOCKED BOTH HIS SON AND I WERE
HIS
ATTACK DID NOT LAST LONG HOWEVER FOR WHEN WE UNDID HIS COLLAR AND
SPRINKLED THE WATER FROM ONE OF THE FINGER GLASSES OVER HIS FACE HE
GAVE A GASP OR TWO AND SAT UP
'AH BOYS SAID HE FORCING A SMILE 'I HOPE I HAVEN'T FRIGHTENED YOU
STRONG AS I LOOK THERE IS A WEAK PLACE IN MY HEART AND IT DOES NOT
TAKE MUCH TO KNOCK ME OVER
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MANAGE THIS MR
HOLMES BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL THE DETECTIVES OF FACT AND OF FANCY
WOULD BE CHILDREN IN YOUR HANDS
THAT'S YOUR LINE OF LIFE SIR AND YOU
MAY TAKE THE WORD OF A MAN WHO HAS SEEN SOMETHING OF THE WORLD
AND THAT RECOMMENDATION WITH THE EXAGGERATED ESTIMATE OF MY ABILITY
WITH WHICH HE PREFACED IT WAS IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME WATSON THE VERY
FIRST THING WHICH EVER MADE ME FEEL THAT A PROFESSION MIGHT BE MADE
OUT OF WHAT HAD UP TO THAT TIME BEEN THE MEREST HOBBY
AT THE MOMENT
HOWEVER I WAS TOO MUCH CONCERNED AT THE SUDDEN ILLNESS OF MY HOST TO
THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE
'I HOPE THAT I HAVE SAID NOTHING TO PAIN YOU SAID I
'WELL YOU CERTAINLY TOUCHED UPON RATHER A TENDER POINT
MIGHT I ASK
HOW YOU KNOW AND HOW MUCH YOU KNOW HE SPOKE NOW IN A HALF JESTING
FASHION BUT A LOOK OF TERROR STILL LURKED AT THE BACK OF HIS EYES
'IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF SAID I
'WHEN YOU BARED YOUR ARM TO DRAW
THAT FISH INTO THE BOAT I SAW THAT J
A
HAD BEEN TATTOOED IN THE BEND
OF THE ELBOW
THE LETTERS WERE STILL LEGIBLE BUT IT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR
FROM THEIR BLURRED APPEARANCE AND FROM THE STAINING OF THE SKIN ROUND
THEM THAT EFFORTS HAD BEEN MADE TO OBLITERATE THEM
IT WAS OBVIOUS
THEN THAT THOSE INITIALS HAD ONCE BEEN VERY FAMILIAR TO YOU AND THAT
YOU HAD AFTERWARDS WISHED TO FORGET THEM
WHAT AN EYE YOU HAVE HE CRIED WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
'IT IS JUST AS
YOU SAY
BUT WE WON'T TALK OF IT
OF ALL GHOSTS THE GHOSTS OF OUR OLD
LOVERS ARE THE WORST
COME INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM AND HAVE A QUIET
CIGAR
FROM THAT DAY AMID ALL HIS CORDIALITY THERE WAS ALWAYS A TOUCH OF
SUSPICION IN MR
TREVOR'S MANNER TOWARDS ME
EVEN HIS SON REMARKED IT
'YOU'VE GIVEN THE GOVERNOR SUCH A TURN SAID HE 'THAT HE'LL NEVER BE
SURE AGAIN OF WHAT YOU KNOW AND WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW HE DID NOT MEAN
TO SHOW IT I AM SURE BUT IT WAS SO STRONGLY IN HIS MIND THAT IT PEEPED
OUT AT EVERY ACTION
AT LAST I BECAME SO CONVINCED THAT I WAS CAUSING
HIM UNEASINESS THAT I DREW MY VISIT TO A CLOSE
ON THE VERY DAY
HOWEVER BEFORE I LEFT AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH PROVED IN THE SEQUEL
TO BE OF IMPORTANCE
WE WERE SITTING OUT UPON THE LAWN ON GARDEN CHAIRS THE THREE OF US
BASKING IN THE SUN AND ADMIRING THE VIEW ACROSS THE BROADS WHEN A MAID
CAME OUT TO SAY THAT THERE WAS A MAN AT THE DOOR WHO WANTED TO SEE MR
TREVOR
'WHAT IS HIS NAME ASKED MY HOST
'HE WOULD NOT GIVE ANY
'WHAT DOES HE WANT THEN
'HE SAYS THAT YOU KNOW HIM AND THAT HE ONLY WANTS A MOMENT'S
CONVERSATION
'SHOW HIM ROUND HERE AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS THERE APPEARED A LITTLE
WIZENED FELLOW WITH A CRINGING MANNER AND A SHAMBLING STYLE OF
WALKING
HE WORE AN OPEN JACKET WITH A SPLOTCH OF TAR ON THE SLEEVE
A RED AND BLACK CHECK SHIRT DUNGAREE TROUSERS AND HEAVY BOOTS BADLY
WORN
HIS FACE WAS THIN AND BROWN AND CRAFTY WITH A PERPETUAL SMILE
UPON IT WHICH SHOWED AN IRREGULAR LINE OF YELLOW TEETH AND HIS
CRINKLED HANDS WERE HALF CLOSED IN A WAY THAT IS DISTINCTIVE OF SAILORS
AS HE CAME SLOUCHING ACROSS THE LAWN I HEARD MR
TREVOR MAKE A SORT OF
HICCOUGHING NOISE IN HIS THROAT AND JUMPING OUT OF HIS CHAIR HE RAN
INTO THE HOUSE
HE WAS BACK IN A MOMENT AND I SMELT A STRONG REEK OF
BRANDY AS HE PASSED ME
'WELL MY MAN SAID HE
'WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU
THE SAILOR STOOD LOOKING AT HIM WITH PUCKERED EYES AND WITH THE SAME
LOOSE LIPPED SMILE UPON HIS FACE
'YOU DON'T KNOW ME HE ASKED
'WHY DEAR ME IT IS SURELY HUDSON SAID MR
TREVOR IN A TONE OF
SURPRISE
'HUDSON IT IS SIR SAID THE SEAMAN
'WHY IT'S THIRTY YEAR AND MORE
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST
HERE YOU ARE IN YOUR HOUSE AND ME STILL PICKING
MY SALT MEAT OUT OF THE HARNESS CASK
'TUT YOU WILL FIND THAT I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN OLD TIMES CRIED MR
TREVOR AND WALKING TOWARDS THE SAILOR HE SAID SOMETHING IN A LOW
VOICE
'GO INTO THE KITCHEN HE CONTINUED OUT LOUD 'AND YOU WILL GET
FOOD AND DRINK
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I SHALL FIND YOU A SITUATION
'THANK YOU SIR SAID THE SEAMAN TOUCHING HIS FORE LOCK
'I'M JUST
OFF A TWO YEARER IN AN EIGHT KNOT TRAMP SHORT HANDED AT THAT AND I
WANTS A REST
I THOUGHT I'D GET IT EITHER WITH MR
BEDDOES OR WITH YOU
'AH CRIED TREVOR
'YOU KNOW WHERE MR
BEDDOES IS
'BLESS YOU SIR I KNOW WHERE ALL MY OLD FRIENDS ARE SAID THE
FELLOW WITH A SINISTER SMILE AND HE SLOUCHED OFF AFTER THE MAID TO THE
KITCHEN
MR
TREVOR MUMBLED SOMETHING TO US ABOUT HAVING BEEN SHIPMATE
WITH THE MAN WHEN HE WAS GOING BACK TO THE DIGGINGS AND THEN LEAVING
US ON THE LAWN HE WENT INDOORS
AN HOUR LATER WHEN WE ENTERED THE
HOUSE WE FOUND HIM STRETCHED DEAD DRUNK UPON THE DINING ROOM SOFA
THE
WHOLE INCIDENT LEFT A MOST UGLY IMPRESSION UPON MY MIND AND I WAS
NOT SORRY NEXT DAY TO LEAVE DONNITHORPE BEHIND ME FOR I FELT THAT MY
PRESENCE MUST BE A SOURCE OF EMBARRASSMENT TO MY FRIEND
ALL THIS OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST MONTH OF THE LONG VACATION
I WENT
UP TO MY LONDON ROOMS WHERE I SPENT SEVEN WEEKS WORKING OUT A FEW
EXPERIMENTS IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
ONE DAY HOWEVER WHEN THE AUTUMN WAS
FAR ADVANCED AND THE VACATION DRAWING TO A CLOSE I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM
FROM MY FRIEND IMPLORING ME TO RETURN TO DONNITHORPE AND SAYING THAT
HE WAS IN GREAT NEED OF MY ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE
OF COURSE I DROPPED
EVERYTHING AND SET OUT FOR THE NORTH ONCE MORE
HE MET ME WITH THE DOG CART AT THE STATION AND I SAW AT A GLANCE THAT
THE LAST TWO MONTHS HAD BEEN VERY TRYING ONES FOR HIM
HE HAD GROWN THIN
AND CAREWORN AND HAD LOST THE LOUD CHEERY MANNER FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN
REMARKABLE
'THE GOVERNOR IS DYING WERE THE FIRST WORDS HE SAID
'IMPOSSIBLE I CRIED
'WHAT IS THE MATTER
'APOPLEXY
NERVOUS SHOCK HE'S BEEN ON THE VERGE ALL DAY
I DOUBT IF WE
SHALL FIND HIM ALIVE
I WAS AS YOU MAY THINK WATSON HORRIFIED AT THIS UNEXPECTED NEWS
'WHAT HAS CAUSED IT I ASKED
'AH THAT IS THE POINT
JUMP IN AND WE CAN TALK IT OVER WHILE WE DRIVE
YOU REMEMBER THAT FELLOW WHO CAME UPON THE EVENING BEFORE YOU LEFT US
'PERFECTLY
'DO YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS THAT WE LET INTO THE HOUSE THAT DAY
'I HAVE NO IDEA
'IT WAS THE DEVIL HOLMES HE CRIED
I STARED AT HIM IN ASTONISHMENT
'YES IT WAS THE DEVIL HIMSELF
WE HAVE NOT HAD A PEACEFUL HOUR
SINCE NOT ONE
THE GOVERNOR HAS NEVER HELD UP HIS HEAD FROM THAT
EVENING AND NOW THE LIFE HAS BEEN CRUSHED OUT OF HIM AND HIS HEART
BROKEN ALL THROUGH THIS ACCURSED HUDSON
'WHAT POWER HAD HE THEN
'AH THAT IS WHAT I WOULD GIVE SO MUCH TO KNOW
THE KINDLY CHARITABLE
GOOD OLD GOVERNOR HOW COULD HE HAVE FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF SUCH A
RUFFIAN BUT I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME HOLMES
I TRUST VERY MUCH
TO YOUR JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL ADVISE ME FOR
THE BEST
WE WERE DASHING ALONG THE SMOOTH WHITE COUNTRY ROAD WITH THE LONG
STRETCH OF THE BROADS IN FRONT OF US GLIMMERING IN THE RED LIGHT OF THE
SETTING SUN
FROM A GROVE UPON OUR LEFT I COULD ALREADY SEE THE HIGH
CHIMNEYS AND THE FLAG STAFF WHICH MARKED THE SQUIRE'S DWELLING
'MY FATHER MADE THE FELLOW GARDENER SAID MY COMPANION 'AND THEN AS
THAT DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WAS PROMOTED TO BE BUTLER
THE HOUSE SEEMED
TO BE AT HIS MERCY AND HE WANDERED ABOUT AND DID WHAT HE CHOSE IN IT
THE MAIDS COMPLAINED OF HIS DRUNKEN HABITS AND HIS VILE LANGUAGE
THE
DAD RAISED THEIR WAGES ALL ROUND TO RECOMPENSE THEM FOR THE ANNOYANCE
THE FELLOW WOULD TAKE THE BOAT AND MY FATHER'S BEST GUN AND TREAT
HIMSELF TO LITTLE SHOOTING TRIPS
AND ALL THIS WITH SUCH A SNEERING
LEERING INSOLENT FACE THAT I WOULD HAVE KNOCKED HIM DOWN TWENTY TIMES
OVER IF HE HAD BEEN A MAN OF MY OWN AGE
I TELL YOU HOLMES I HAVE
HAD TO KEEP A TIGHT HOLD UPON MYSELF ALL THIS TIME AND NOW I AM ASKING
MYSELF WHETHER IF I HAD LET MYSELF GO A LITTLE MORE I MIGHT NOT HAVE
BEEN A WISER MAN
'WELL MATTERS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE WITH US AND THIS ANIMAL HUDSON
BECAME MORE AND MORE INTRUSIVE UNTIL AT LAST ON MAKING SOME INSOLENT
REPLY TO MY FATHER IN MY PRESENCE ONE DAY I TOOK HIM BY THE SHOULDERS
AND TURNED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM
HE SLUNK AWAY WITH A LIVID FACE AND TWO
VENOMOUS EYES WHICH UTTERED MORE THREATS THAN HIS TONGUE COULD DO
I
DON'T KNOW WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THE POOR DAD AND HIM AFTER THAT BUT THE
DAD CAME TO ME NEXT DAY AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD MIND APOLOGIZING TO
HUDSON
I REFUSED AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND ASKED MY FATHER HOW HE
COULD ALLOW SUCH A WRETCH TO TAKE SUCH LIBERTIES WITH HIMSELF AND HIS
HOUSEHOLD
AH MY BOY SAID HE IT IS ALL VERY WELL TO TALK BUT YOU DON'T
KNOW HOW I AM PLACED
BUT YOU SHALL KNOW VICTOR
I'LL SEE THAT YOU
SHALL KNOW COME WHAT MAY
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HARM OF YOUR POOR OLD
FATHER WOULD YOU LAD HE WAS VERY MUCH MOVED AND SHUT HIMSELF UP
IN THE STUDY ALL DAY WHERE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE WINDOW THAT HE WAS
WRITING BUSILY
'THAT EVENING THERE CAME WHAT SEEMED TO ME TO BE A GRAND RELEASE
FOR HUDSON TOLD US THAT HE WAS GOING TO LEAVE US
HE WALKED INTO THE
DINING ROOM AS WE SAT AFTER DINNER AND ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION IN THE
THICK VOICE OF A HALF DRUNKEN MAN
I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF NORFOLK SAID HE
I'LL RUN DOWN TO MR
BEDDOES
IN HAMPSHIRE
HE'LL BE AS GLAD TO SEE ME AS YOU WERE I DARE SAY
YOU'RE NOT GOING AWAY IN AN UNKIND SPIRIT HUDSON I HOPE SAID MY
FATHER WITH A TAMENESS WHICH MADE MY BLOOD BOIL
I'VE NOT HAD MY 'POLOGY SAID HE SULKILY GLANCING IN MY DIRECTION
VICTOR YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE USED THIS WORTHY FELLOW
RATHER ROUGHLY SAID THE DAD TURNING TO ME
ON THE CONTRARY I THINK THAT WE HAVE BOTH SHOWN EXTRAORDINARY
PATIENCE TOWARDS HIM I ANSWERED
OH YOU DO DO YOU HE SNARLS
VERY GOOD MATE
WE'LL SEE ABOUT
THAT
'HE SLOUCHED OUT OF THE ROOM AND HALF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LEFT THE
HOUSE LEAVING MY FATHER IN A STATE OF PITIABLE NERVOUSNESS
NIGHT AFTER
NIGHT I HEARD HIM PACING HIS ROOM AND IT WAS JUST AS HE WAS RECOVERING
HIS CONFIDENCE THAT THE BLOW DID AT LAST FALL
'AND HOW I ASKED EAGERLY
'IN A MOST EXTRAORDINARY FASHION
A LETTER ARRIVED FOR MY FATHER
YESTERDAY EVENING BEARING THE FORDINGBRIDGE POST MARK
MY FATHER READ
IT CLAPPED BOTH HIS HANDS TO HIS HEAD AND BEGAN RUNNING ROUND THE ROOM
IN LITTLE CIRCLES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF HIS SENSES
WHEN
I AT LAST DREW HIM DOWN ON TO THE SOFA HIS MOUTH AND EYELIDS WERE ALL
PUCKERED ON ONE SIDE AND I SAW THAT HE HAD A STROKE
DR
FORDHAM CAME
OVER AT ONCE
WE PUT HIM TO BED BUT THE PARALYSIS HAS SPREAD HE HAS
SHOWN NO SIGN OF RETURNING CONSCIOUSNESS AND I THINK THAT WE SHALL
HARDLY FIND HIM ALIVE
'YOU HORRIFY ME TREVOR I CRIED
'WHAT THEN COULD HAVE BEEN IN THIS
LETTER TO CAUSE SO DREADFUL A RESULT
'NOTHING
THERE LIES THE INEXPLICABLE PART OF IT
THE MESSAGE WAS
ABSURD AND TRIVIAL
AH MY GOD IT IS AS I FEARED
AS HE SPOKE WE CAME ROUND THE CURVE OF THE AVENUE AND SAW IN THE
FADING LIGHT THAT EVERY BLIND IN THE HOUSE HAD BEEN DRAWN DOWN
AS
WE DASHED UP TO THE DOOR MY FRIEND'S FACE CONVULSED WITH GRIEF A
GENTLEMAN IN BLACK EMERGED FROM IT
'WHEN DID IT HAPPEN DOCTOR ASKED TREVOR
'ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU LEFT
'DID HE RECOVER CONSCIOUSNESS
'FOR AN INSTANT BEFORE THE END
'ANY MESSAGE FOR ME
'ONLY THAT THE PAPERS WERE IN THE BACK DRAWER OF THE JAPANESE CABINET
MY FRIEND ASCENDED WITH THE DOCTOR TO THE CHAMBER OF DEATH WHILE I
REMAINED IN THE STUDY TURNING THE WHOLE MATTER OVER AND OVER IN MY
HEAD AND FEELING AS SOMBRE AS EVER I HAD DONE IN MY LIFE
WHAT WAS THE
PAST OF THIS TREVOR PUGILIST TRAVELER AND GOLD DIGGER AND HOW HAD HE
PLACED HIMSELF IN THE POWER OF THIS ACID FACED SEAMAN WHY TOO SHOULD
HE FAINT AT AN ALLUSION TO THE HALF EFFACED INITIALS UPON HIS ARM AND
DIE OF FRIGHT WHEN HE HAD A LETTER FROM FORDINGHAM THEN I REMEMBERED
THAT FORDINGHAM WAS IN HAMPSHIRE AND THAT THIS MR
BEDDOES WHOM THE
SEAMAN HAD GONE TO VISIT AND PRESUMABLY TO BLACKMAIL HAD ALSO BEEN
MENTIONED AS LIVING IN HAMPSHIRE
THE LETTER THEN MIGHT EITHER COME
FROM HUDSON THE SEAMAN SAYING THAT HE HAD BETRAYED THE GUILTY SECRET
WHICH APPEARED TO EXIST OR IT MIGHT COME FROM BEDDOES WARNING AN OLD
CONFEDERATE THAT SUCH A BETRAYAL WAS IMMINENT
SO FAR IT SEEMED CLEAR
ENOUGH
BUT THEN HOW COULD THIS LETTER BE TRIVIAL AND GROTESQUE AS
DESCRIBED BY THE SON HE MUST HAVE MISREAD IT
IF SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN
ONE OF THOSE INGENIOUS SECRET CODES WHICH MEAN ONE THING WHILE THEY SEEM
TO MEAN ANOTHER
I MUST SEE THIS LETTER
IF THERE WERE A HIDDEN MEANING
IN IT I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD PLUCK IT FORTH
FOR AN HOUR I SAT
PONDERING OVER IT IN THE GLOOM UNTIL AT LAST A WEEPING MAID BROUGHT IN
A LAMP AND CLOSE AT HER HEELS CAME MY FRIEND TREVOR PALE BUT COMPOSED
WITH THESE VERY PAPERS WHICH LIE UPON MY KNEE HELD IN HIS GRASP
HE SAT
DOWN OPPOSITE TO ME DREW THE LAMP TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE AND HANDED
ME A SHORT NOTE SCRIBBLED AS YOU SEE UPON A SINGLE SHEET OF GRAY
PAPER
'THE SUPPLY OF GAME FOR LONDON IS GOING STEADILY UP IT RAN
'HEAD KEEPER HUDSON WE BELIEVE HAS BEEN NOW TOLD TO RECEIVE ALL ORDERS
FOR FLY PAPER AND FOR PRESERVATION OF YOUR HEN PHEASANT'S LIFE
I DARE SAY MY FACE LOOKED AS BEWILDERED AS YOURS DID JUST NOW WHEN
FIRST I READ THIS MESSAGE
THEN I REREAD IT VERY CAREFULLY
IT WAS
EVIDENTLY AS I HAD THOUGHT AND SOME SECRET MEANING MUST LIE BURIED
IN THIS STRANGE COMBINATION OF WORDS
OR COULD IT BE THAT THERE WAS
A PREARRANGED SIGNIFICANCE TO SUCH PHRASES AS 'FLY PAPER' AND
'HEN PHEASANT' SUCH A MEANING WOULD BE ARBITRARY AND COULD NOT BE
DEDUCED IN ANY WAY
AND YET I WAS LOATH TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS THE
CASE AND THE PRESENCE OF THE WORD HUDSON SEEMED TO SHOW THAT THE
SUBJECT OF THE MESSAGE WAS AS I HAD GUESSED AND THAT IT WAS FROM
BEDDOES RATHER THAN THE SAILOR
I TRIED IT BACKWARDS BUT THE
COMBINATION 'LIFE PHEASANT'S HEN' WAS NOT ENCOURAGING
THEN I TRIED
ALTERNATE WORDS BUT NEITHER 'THE OF FOR' NOR 'SUPPLY GAME LONDON'
PROMISED TO THROW ANY LIGHT UPON IT
AND THEN IN AN INSTANT THE KEY OF THE RIDDLE WAS IN MY HANDS AND I SAW
THAT EVERY THIRD WORD BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST WOULD GIVE A MESSAGE
WHICH MIGHT WELL DRIVE OLD TREVOR TO DESPAIR
IT WAS SHORT AND TERSE THE WARNING AS I NOW READ IT TO MY COMPANION
'THE GAME IS UP
HUDSON HAS TOLD ALL
FLY FOR YOUR LIFE
VICTOR TREVOR SANK HIS FACE INTO HIS SHAKING HANDS
'IT MUST BE THAT
I SUPPOSE SAID HE
THIS IS WORSE THAN DEATH FOR IT MEANS DISGRACE
AS WELL
BUT WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THESE HEAD KEEPERS AND
HEN PHEASANTS
'IT MEANS NOTHING TO THE MESSAGE BUT IT MIGHT MEAN A GOOD DEAL TO US
IF WE HAD NO OTHER MEANS OF DISCOVERING THE SENDER
YOU SEE THAT HE HAS
BEGUN BY WRITING THE GAME IS AND SO ON
AFTERWARDS HE HAD TO
FULFILL THE PREARRANGED CIPHER TO FILL IN ANY TWO WORDS IN EACH SPACE
HE WOULD NATURALLY USE THE FIRST WORDS WHICH CAME TO HIS MIND AND
IF THERE WERE SO MANY WHICH REFERRED TO SPORT AMONG THEM YOU MAY
BE TOLERABLY SURE THAT HE IS EITHER AN ARDENT SHOT OR INTERESTED IN
BREEDING
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THIS BEDDOES
'WHY NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT SAID HE 'I REMEMBER THAT MY POOR
FATHER USED TO HAVE AN INVITATION FROM HIM TO SHOOT OVER HIS PRESERVES
EVERY AUTUMN
'THEN IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY FROM HIM THAT THE NOTE COMES SAID I
'IT ONLY
REMAINS FOR US TO FIND OUT WHAT THIS SECRET WAS WHICH THE SAILOR HUDSON
SEEMS TO HAVE HELD OVER THE HEADS OF THESE TWO WEALTHY AND RESPECTED
MEN
'ALAS HOLMES I FEAR THAT IT IS ONE OF SIN AND SHAME CRIED MY
FRIEND
'BUT FROM YOU I SHALL HAVE NO SECRETS
HERE IS THE STATEMENT
WHICH WAS DRAWN UP BY MY FATHER WHEN HE KNEW THAT THE DANGER FROM HUDSON
HAD BECOME IMMINENT
I FOUND IT IN THE JAPANESE CABINET AS HE TOLD THE
DOCTOR
TAKE IT AND READ IT TO ME FOR I HAVE NEITHER THE STRENGTH NOR
THE COURAGE TO DO IT MYSELF
THESE ARE THE VERY PAPERS WATSON WHICH HE HANDED TO ME AND I WILL
READ THEM TO YOU AS I READ THEM IN THE OLD STUDY THAT NIGHT TO HIM
THEY ARE ENDORSED OUTSIDE AS YOU SEE 'SOME PARTICULARS OF THE VOYAGE
OF THE BARK GLORIA SCOTT FROM HER LEAVING FALMOUTH ON THE 8TH
OCTOBER 1855 TO HER DESTRUCTION IN N
LAT
15 DEGREES 20' W
LONG
25 DEGREES 14' ON NOV
6TH IT IS IN THE FORM OF A LETTER AND RUNS IN
THIS WAY
'MY DEAR DEAR SON NOW THAT APPROACHING DISGRACE BEGINS TO DARKEN THE
CLOSING YEARS OF MY LIFE I CAN WRITE WITH ALL TRUTH AND HONESTY THAT IT
IS NOT THE TERROR OF THE LAW IT IS NOT THE LOSS OF MY POSITION IN THE
COUNTY NOR IS IT MY FALL IN THE EYES OF ALL WHO HAVE KNOWN ME WHICH
CUTS ME TO THE HEART BUT IT IS THE THOUGHT THAT YOU SHOULD COME TO
BLUSH FOR ME YOU WHO LOVE ME AND WHO HAVE SELDOM I HOPE HAD REASON TO
DO OTHER THAN RESPECT ME
BUT IF THE BLOW FALLS WHICH IS FOREVER HANGING
OVER ME THEN I SHOULD WISH YOU TO READ THIS THAT YOU MAY KNOW STRAIGHT
FROM ME HOW FAR I HAVE BEEN TO BLAME
ON THE OTHER HAND IF ALL SHOULD
GO WELL WHICH MAY KIND GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT THEN IF BY ANY CHANCE THIS
PAPER SHOULD BE STILL UNDESTROYED AND SHOULD FALL INTO YOUR HANDS I
CONJURE YOU BY ALL YOU HOLD SACRED BY THE MEMORY OF YOUR DEAR MOTHER
AND BY THE LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN BETWEEN US TO HURL IT INTO THE FIRE AND
TO NEVER GIVE ONE THOUGHT TO IT AGAIN
'IF THEN YOUR EYE GOES ON TO READ THIS LINE I KNOW THAT I SHALL
ALREADY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED AND DRAGGED FROM MY HOME OR AS IS MORE
LIKELY FOR YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IS WEAK BY LYING WITH MY TONGUE
SEALED FOREVER IN DEATH
IN EITHER CASE THE TIME FOR SUPPRESSION IS
PAST AND EVERY WORD WHICH I TELL YOU IS THE NAKED TRUTH AND THIS I
SWEAR AS I HOPE FOR MERCY
'MY NAME DEAR LAD IS NOT TREVOR
I WAS JAMES ARMITAGE IN MY YOUNGER
DAYS AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND NOW THE SHOCK THAT IT WAS TO ME A FEW WEEKS
AGO WHEN YOUR COLLEGE FRIEND ADDRESSED ME IN WORDS WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY
THAT HE HAD SURPRISED MY SECRET
AS ARMITAGE IT WAS THAT I ENTERED A
LONDON BANKING HOUSE AND AS ARMITAGE I WAS CONVICTED OF BREAKING MY
COUNTRY'S LAWS AND WAS SENTENCED TO TRANSPORTATION
DO NOT THINK VERY
HARSHLY OF ME LADDIE
IT WAS A DEBT OF HONOR SO CALLED WHICH I HAD
TO PAY AND I USED MONEY WHICH WAS NOT MY OWN TO DO IT IN THE CERTAINTY
THAT I COULD REPLACE IT BEFORE THERE COULD BE ANY POSSIBILITY OF ITS
BEING MISSED
BUT THE MOST DREADFUL ILL LUCK PURSUED ME
THE MONEY WHICH
I HAD RECKONED UPON NEVER CAME TO HAND AND A PREMATURE EXAMINATION OF
ACCOUNTS EXPOSED MY DEFICIT
THE CASE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEALT LENIENTLY
WITH BUT THE LAWS WERE MORE HARSHLY ADMINISTERED THIRTY YEARS AGO THAN
NOW AND ON MY TWENTY THIRD BIRTHDAY I FOUND MYSELF CHAINED AS A FELON
WITH THIRTY SEVEN OTHER CONVICTS IN 'TWEEN DECKS OF THE BARK GLORIA
SCOTT BOUND FOR AUSTRALIA
'IT WAS THE YEAR '55 WHEN THE CRIMEAN WAR WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AND THE
OLD CONVICT SHIPS HAD BEEN LARGELY USED AS TRANSPORTS IN THE BLACK
SEA
THE GOVERNMENT WAS COMPELLED THEREFORE TO USE SMALLER AND LESS
SUITABLE VESSELS FOR SENDING OUT THEIR PRISONERS
THE GLORIA SCOTT
HAD BEEN IN THE CHINESE TEA TRADE BUT SHE WAS AN OLD FASHIONED
HEAVY BOWED BROAD BEAMED CRAFT AND THE NEW CLIPPERS HAD CUT HER
OUT
SHE WAS A FIVE HUNDRED TON BOAT AND BESIDES HER THIRTY EIGHT
