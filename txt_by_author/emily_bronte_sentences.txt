WUTHERING HEIGHTS
CHAPTER I
1801 I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM A VISIT TO MY LANDLORD THE SOLITARY
NEIGHBOUR THAT I SHALL BE TROUBLED WITH
THIS IS CERTAINLY A BEAUTIFUL
COUNTRY IN ALL ENGLAND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I COULD HAVE FIXED ON A
SITUATION SO COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE STIR OF SOCIETY
A PERFECT
MISANTHROPIST'S HEAVEN AND MR
HEATHCLIFF AND I ARE SUCH A SUITABLE PAIR
TO DIVIDE THE DESOLATION BETWEEN US
A CAPITAL FELLOW HE LITTLE
IMAGINED HOW MY HEART WARMED TOWARDS HIM WHEN I BEHELD HIS BLACK EYES
WITHDRAW SO SUSPICIOUSLY UNDER THEIR BROWS AS I RODE UP AND WHEN HIS
FINGERS SHELTERED THEMSELVES WITH A JEALOUS RESOLUTION STILL FURTHER IN
HIS WAISTCOAT AS I ANNOUNCED MY NAME
'MR
HEATHCLIFF I SAID
A NOD WAS THE ANSWER
'MR
LOCKWOOD YOUR NEW TENANT SIR
I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF CALLING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER MY ARRIVAL TO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT I HAVE NOT
INCONVENIENCED YOU BY MY PERSEVERANCE IN SOLICITING THE OCCUPATION OF
THRUSHCROSS GRANGE I HEARD YESTERDAY YOU HAD HAD SOME THOUGHTS
'THRUSHCROSS GRANGE IS MY OWN SIR HE INTERRUPTED WINCING
'I SHOULD
NOT ALLOW ANY ONE TO INCONVENIENCE ME IF I COULD HINDER IT WALK IN
THE 'WALK IN' WAS UTTERED WITH CLOSED TEETH AND EXPRESSED THE SENTIMENT
'GO TO THE DEUCE EVEN THE GATE OVER WHICH HE LEANT MANIFESTED NO
SYMPATHISING MOVEMENT TO THE WORDS AND I THINK THAT CIRCUMSTANCE
DETERMINED ME TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION I FELT INTERESTED IN A MAN WHO
SEEMED MORE EXAGGERATEDLY RESERVED THAN MYSELF
WHEN HE SAW MY HORSE'S BREAST FAIRLY PUSHING THE BARRIER HE DID PUT OUT
HIS HAND TO UNCHAIN IT AND THEN SULLENLY PRECEDED ME UP THE CAUSEWAY
CALLING AS WE ENTERED THE COURT 'JOSEPH TAKE MR
LOCKWOOD'S HORSE
AND BRING UP SOME WINE
'HERE WE HAVE THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT OF DOMESTICS I SUPPOSE WAS THE
REFLECTION SUGGESTED BY THIS COMPOUND ORDER
'NO WONDER THE GRASS GROWS
UP BETWEEN THE FLAGS AND CATTLE ARE THE ONLY HEDGE CUTTERS
JOSEPH WAS AN ELDERLY NAY AN OLD MAN VERY OLD PERHAPS THOUGH HALE
AND SINEWY
'THE LORD HELP US HE SOLILOQUISED IN AN UNDERTONE OF
PEEVISH DISPLEASURE WHILE RELIEVING ME OF MY HORSE LOOKING MEANTIME
IN MY FACE SO SOURLY THAT I CHARITABLY CONJECTURED HE MUST HAVE NEED OF
DIVINE AID TO DIGEST HIS DINNER AND HIS PIOUS EJACULATION HAD NO
REFERENCE TO MY UNEXPECTED ADVENT
WUTHERING HEIGHTS IS THE NAME OF MR
HEATHCLIFF'S DWELLING
'WUTHERING'
BEING A SIGNIFICANT PROVINCIAL ADJECTIVE DESCRIPTIVE OF THE ATMOSPHERIC
TUMULT TO WHICH ITS STATION IS EXPOSED IN STORMY WEATHER
PURE BRACING
VENTILATION THEY MUST HAVE UP THERE AT ALL TIMES INDEED ONE MAY GUESS
THE POWER OF THE NORTH WIND BLOWING OVER THE EDGE BY THE EXCESSIVE SLANT
OF A FEW STUNTED FIRS AT THE END OF THE HOUSE AND BY A RANGE OF GAUNT
THORNS ALL STRETCHING THEIR LIMBS ONE WAY AS IF CRAVING ALMS OF THE SUN
HAPPILY THE ARCHITECT HAD FORESIGHT TO BUILD IT STRONG THE NARROW
WINDOWS ARE DEEPLY SET IN THE WALL AND THE CORNERS DEFENDED WITH LARGE
JUTTING STONES
BEFORE PASSING THE THRESHOLD I PAUSED TO ADMIRE A QUANTITY OF GROTESQUE
CARVING LAVISHED OVER THE FRONT AND ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL DOOR
ABOVE WHICH AMONG A WILDERNESS OF CRUMBLING GRIFFINS AND SHAMELESS
LITTLE BOYS I DETECTED THE DATE '1500 AND THE NAME 'HARETON EARNSHAW
I WOULD HAVE MADE A FEW COMMENTS AND REQUESTED A SHORT HISTORY OF THE
PLACE FROM THE SURLY OWNER BUT HIS ATTITUDE AT THE DOOR APPEARED TO
DEMAND MY SPEEDY ENTRANCE OR COMPLETE DEPARTURE AND I HAD NO DESIRE TO
AGGRAVATE HIS IMPATIENCE PREVIOUS TO INSPECTING THE PENETRALIUM
ONE STOP BROUGHT US INTO THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM WITHOUT ANY
INTRODUCTORY LOBBY OR PASSAGE THEY CALL IT HERE 'THE HOUSE'
PRE EMINENTLY
IT INCLUDES KITCHEN AND PARLOUR GENERALLY BUT I BELIEVE
AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS THE KITCHEN IS FORCED TO RETREAT ALTOGETHER INTO
ANOTHER QUARTER AT LEAST I DISTINGUISHED A CHATTER OF TONGUES AND A
CLATTER OF CULINARY UTENSILS DEEP WITHIN AND I OBSERVED NO SIGNS OF
ROASTING BOILING OR BAKING ABOUT THE HUGE FIREPLACE NOR ANY GLITTER
OF COPPER SAUCEPANS AND TIN CULLENDERS ON THE WALLS
ONE END INDEED
REFLECTED SPLENDIDLY BOTH LIGHT AND HEAT FROM RANKS OF IMMENSE PEWTER
DISHES INTERSPERSED WITH SILVER JUGS AND TANKARDS TOWERING ROW AFTER
ROW ON A VAST OAK DRESSER TO THE VERY ROOF
THE LATTER HAD NEVER BEEN
UNDER DRAWN ITS ENTIRE ANATOMY LAY BARE TO AN INQUIRING EYE EXCEPT
WHERE A FRAME OF WOOD LADEN WITH OATCAKES AND CLUSTERS OF LEGS OF BEEF
MUTTON AND HAM CONCEALED IT
ABOVE THE CHIMNEY WERE SUNDRY VILLAINOUS
OLD GUNS AND A COUPLE OF HORSE PISTOLS AND BY WAY OF ORNAMENT THREE
GAUDILY PAINTED CANISTERS DISPOSED ALONG ITS LEDGE
THE FLOOR WAS OF
SMOOTH WHITE STONE THE CHAIRS HIGH BACKED PRIMITIVE STRUCTURES
PAINTED GREEN ONE OR TWO HEAVY BLACK ONES LURKING IN THE SHADE
IN AN
ARCH UNDER THE DRESSER REPOSED A HUGE LIVER COLOURED BITCH POINTER
SURROUNDED BY A SWARM OF SQUEALING PUPPIES AND OTHER DOGS HAUNTED OTHER
RECESSES
THE APARTMENT AND FURNITURE WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING EXTRAORDINARY AS
BELONGING TO A HOMELY NORTHERN FARMER WITH A STUBBORN COUNTENANCE AND
STALWART LIMBS SET OUT TO ADVANTAGE IN KNEE BREECHES AND GAITERS
SUCH
AN INDIVIDUAL SEATED IN HIS ARM CHAIR HIS MUG OF ALE FROTHING ON THE
ROUND TABLE BEFORE HIM IS TO BE SEEN IN ANY CIRCUIT OF FIVE OR SIX MILES
AMONG THESE HILLS IF YOU GO AT THE RIGHT TIME AFTER DINNER
BUT MR
HEATHCLIFF FORMS A SINGULAR CONTRAST TO HIS ABODE AND STYLE OF LIVING
HE
IS A DARK SKINNED GIPSY IN ASPECT IN DRESS AND MANNERS A GENTLEMAN THAT
IS AS MUCH A GENTLEMAN AS MANY A COUNTRY SQUIRE RATHER SLOVENLY
PERHAPS YET NOT LOOKING AMISS WITH HIS NEGLIGENCE BECAUSE HE HAS AN
ERECT AND HANDSOME FIGURE AND RATHER MOROSE
POSSIBLY SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT SUSPECT HIM OF A DEGREE OF UNDER BRED PRIDE I HAVE A SYMPATHETIC
CHORD WITHIN THAT TELLS ME IT IS NOTHING OF THE SORT I KNOW BY
INSTINCT HIS RESERVE SPRINGS FROM AN AVERSION TO SHOWY DISPLAYS OF
FEELING TO MANIFESTATIONS OF MUTUAL KINDLINESS
HE'LL LOVE AND HATE
EQUALLY UNDER COVER AND ESTEEM IT A SPECIES OF IMPERTINENCE TO BE LOVED
OR HATED AGAIN
NO I'M RUNNING ON TOO FAST I BESTOW MY OWN ATTRIBUTES
OVER LIBERALLY ON HIM
MR
HEATHCLIFF MAY HAVE ENTIRELY DISSIMILAR
REASONS FOR KEEPING HIS HAND OUT OF THE WAY WHEN HE MEETS A WOULD BE
ACQUAINTANCE TO THOSE WHICH ACTUATE ME
LET ME HOPE MY CONSTITUTION IS
ALMOST PECULIAR MY DEAR MOTHER USED TO SAY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE A
COMFORTABLE HOME AND ONLY LAST SUMMER I PROVED MYSELF PERFECTLY UNWORTHY
OF ONE
WHILE ENJOYING A MONTH OF FINE WEATHER AT THE SEA COAST I WAS THROWN
INTO THE COMPANY OF A MOST FASCINATING CREATURE A REAL GODDESS IN MY
EYES AS LONG AS SHE TOOK NO NOTICE OF ME
I 'NEVER TOLD MY LOVE'
VOCALLY STILL IF LOOKS HAVE LANGUAGE THE MEREST IDIOT MIGHT HAVE
GUESSED I WAS OVER HEAD AND EARS SHE UNDERSTOOD ME AT LAST AND LOOKED A
RETURN THE SWEETEST OF ALL IMAGINABLE LOOKS
AND WHAT DID I DO I
CONFESS IT WITH SHAME SHRUNK ICILY INTO MYSELF LIKE A SNAIL AT EVERY
GLANCE RETIRED COLDER AND FARTHER TILL FINALLY THE POOR INNOCENT WAS LED
TO DOUBT HER OWN SENSES AND OVERWHELMED WITH CONFUSION AT HER SUPPOSED
MISTAKE PERSUADED HER MAMMA TO DECAMP
BY THIS CURIOUS TURN OF
DISPOSITION I HAVE GAINED THE REPUTATION OF DELIBERATE HEARTLESSNESS HOW
UNDESERVED I ALONE CAN APPRECIATE
I TOOK A SEAT AT THE END OF THE HEARTHSTONE OPPOSITE THAT TOWARDS WHICH
MY LANDLORD ADVANCED AND FILLED UP AN INTERVAL OF SILENCE BY ATTEMPTING
TO CARESS THE CANINE MOTHER WHO HAD LEFT HER NURSERY AND WAS SNEAKING
WOLFISHLY TO THE BACK OF MY LEGS HER LIP CURLED UP AND HER WHITE TEETH
WATERING FOR A SNATCH
MY CARESS PROVOKED A LONG GUTTURAL GNARL
'YOU'D BETTER LET THE DOG ALONE GROWLED MR
HEATHCLIFF IN UNISON
CHECKING FIERCER DEMONSTRATIONS WITH A PUNCH OF HIS FOOT
'SHE'S NOT
ACCUSTOMED TO BE SPOILED NOT KEPT FOR A PET THEN STRIDING TO A SIDE
DOOR HE SHOUTED AGAIN 'JOSEPH
JOSEPH MUMBLED INDISTINCTLY IN THE DEPTHS OF THE CELLAR BUT GAVE NO
INTIMATION OF ASCENDING SO HIS MASTER DIVED DOWN TO HIM LEAVING ME
VIS A VIS THE RUFFIANLY BITCH AND A PAIR OF GRIM SHAGGY SHEEP DOGS
WHO SHARED WITH HER A JEALOUS GUARDIANSHIP OVER ALL MY MOVEMENTS
NOT
ANXIOUS TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THEIR FANGS I SAT STILL BUT IMAGINING
THEY WOULD SCARCELY UNDERSTAND TACIT INSULTS I UNFORTUNATELY INDULGED
IN WINKING AND MAKING FACES AT THE TRIO AND SOME TURN OF MY PHYSIOGNOMY
SO IRRITATED MADAM THAT SHE SUDDENLY BROKE INTO A FURY AND LEAPT ON MY
KNEES
I FLUNG HER BACK AND HASTENED TO INTERPOSE THE TABLE BETWEEN US
THIS PROCEEDING AROUSED THE WHOLE HIVE HALF A DOZEN FOUR FOOTED FIENDS
OF VARIOUS SIZES AND AGES ISSUED FROM HIDDEN DENS TO THE COMMON CENTRE
I FELT MY HEELS AND COAT LAPS PECULIAR SUBJECTS OF ASSAULT AND PARRYING
OFF THE LARGER COMBATANTS AS EFFECTUALLY AS I COULD WITH THE POKER I
WAS CONSTRAINED TO DEMAND ALOUD ASSISTANCE FROM SOME OF THE HOUSEHOLD
IN RE ESTABLISHING PEACE
MR
HEATHCLIFF AND HIS MAN CLIMBED THE CELLAR STEPS WITH VEXATIOUS
PHLEGM I DON'T THINK THEY MOVED ONE SECOND FASTER THAN USUAL THOUGH
THE HEARTH WAS AN ABSOLUTE TEMPEST OF WORRYING AND YELPING
HAPPILY AN
INHABITANT OF THE KITCHEN MADE MORE DESPATCH A LUSTY DAME WITH
TUCKED UP GOWN BARE ARMS AND FIRE FLUSHED CHEEKS RUSHED INTO THE
MIDST OF US FLOURISHING A FRYING PAN AND USED THAT WEAPON AND HER
TONGUE TO SUCH PURPOSE THAT THE STORM SUBSIDED MAGICALLY AND SHE ONLY
REMAINED HEAVING LIKE A SEA AFTER A HIGH WIND WHEN HER MASTER ENTERED
ON THE SCENE
'WHAT THE DEVIL IS THE MATTER HE ASKED EYEING ME IN A MANNER THAT I
COULD ILL ENDURE AFTER THIS INHOSPITABLE TREATMENT
'WHAT THE DEVIL INDEED I MUTTERED
'THE HERD OF POSSESSED SWINE COULD
HAVE HAD NO WORSE SPIRITS IN THEM THAN THOSE ANIMALS OF YOURS SIR
YOU
MIGHT AS WELL LEAVE A STRANGER WITH A BROOD OF TIGERS
'THEY WON'T MEDDLE WITH PERSONS WHO TOUCH NOTHING HE REMARKED PUTTING
THE BOTTLE BEFORE ME AND RESTORING THE DISPLACED TABLE
'THE DOGS DO
RIGHT TO BE VIGILANT
TAKE A GLASS OF WINE
'NO THANK YOU
'NOT BITTEN ARE YOU
'IF I HAD BEEN I WOULD HAVE SET MY SIGNET ON THE BITER HEATHCLIFF'S
COUNTENANCE RELAXED INTO A GRIN
'COME COME HE SAID 'YOU ARE FLURRIED MR
LOCKWOOD
HERE TAKE A
LITTLE WINE
GUESTS ARE SO EXCEEDINGLY RARE IN THIS HOUSE THAT I AND MY
DOGS I AM WILLING TO OWN HARDLY KNOW HOW TO RECEIVE THEM
YOUR HEALTH
SIR
I BOWED AND RETURNED THE PLEDGE BEGINNING TO PERCEIVE THAT IT WOULD BE
FOOLISH TO SIT SULKING FOR THE MISBEHAVIOUR OF A PACK OF CURS BESIDES I
FELT LOTH TO YIELD THE FELLOW FURTHER AMUSEMENT AT MY EXPENSE SINCE HIS
HUMOUR TOOK THAT TURN
HE PROBABLY SWAYED BY PRUDENTIAL CONSIDERATION
OF THE FOLLY OF OFFENDING A GOOD TENANT RELAXED A LITTLE IN THE LACONIC
STYLE OF CHIPPING OFF HIS PRONOUNS AND AUXILIARY VERBS AND INTRODUCED
WHAT HE SUPPOSED WOULD BE A SUBJECT OF INTEREST TO ME A DISCOURSE ON
THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF MY PRESENT PLACE OF RETIREMENT
I
FOUND HIM VERY INTELLIGENT ON THE TOPICS WE TOUCHED AND BEFORE I WENT
HOME I WAS ENCOURAGED SO FAR AS TO VOLUNTEER ANOTHER VISIT TO MORROW
HE
EVIDENTLY WISHED NO REPETITION OF MY INTRUSION
I SHALL GO
NOTWITHSTANDING
IT IS ASTONISHING HOW SOCIABLE I FEEL MYSELF COMPARED
WITH HIM
CHAPTER II
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON SET IN MISTY AND COLD
I HAD HALF A MIND TO SPEND IT
BY MY STUDY FIRE INSTEAD OF WADING THROUGH HEATH AND MUD TO WUTHERING
HEIGHTS
ON COMING UP FROM DINNER HOWEVER N B I DINE BETWEEN TWELVE
AND ONE O'CLOCK THE HOUSEKEEPER A MATRONLY LADY TAKEN AS A FIXTURE
ALONG WITH THE HOUSE COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT COMPREHEND MY REQUEST THAT
I MIGHT BE SERVED AT FIVE ON MOUNTING THE STAIRS WITH THIS LAZY
INTENTION AND STEPPING INTO THE ROOM I SAW A SERVANT GIRL ON HER KNEES
SURROUNDED BY BRUSHES AND COAL SCUTTLES AND RAISING AN INFERNAL DUST AS
SHE EXTINGUISHED THE FLAMES WITH HEAPS OF CINDERS
THIS SPECTACLE DROVE
ME BACK IMMEDIATELY I TOOK MY HAT AND AFTER A FOUR MILES' WALK
ARRIVED AT HEATHCLIFF'S GARDEN GATE JUST IN TIME TO ESCAPE THE FIRST
FEATHERY FLAKES OF A SNOW SHOWER
ON THAT BLEAK HILL TOP THE EARTH WAS HARD WITH A BLACK FROST AND THE AIR
MADE ME SHIVER THROUGH EVERY LIMB
BEING UNABLE TO REMOVE THE CHAIN I
JUMPED OVER AND RUNNING UP THE FLAGGED CAUSEWAY BORDERED WITH
STRAGGLING GOOSEBERRY BUSHES KNOCKED VAINLY FOR ADMITTANCE TILL MY
KNUCKLES TINGLED AND THE DOGS HOWLED
'WRETCHED INMATES I EJACULATED MENTALLY 'YOU DESERVE PERPETUAL
ISOLATION FROM YOUR SPECIES FOR YOUR CHURLISH INHOSPITALITY
AT LEAST I
WOULD NOT KEEP MY DOORS BARRED IN THE DAY TIME
I DON'T CARE I WILL GET
IN SO RESOLVED I GRASPED THE LATCH AND SHOOK IT VEHEMENTLY
VINEGAR FACED JOSEPH PROJECTED HIS HEAD FROM A ROUND WINDOW OF THE BARN
'WHAT ARE YE FOR HE SHOUTED
'T' MAISTER'S DOWN I' T' FOWLD
GO ROUND
BY TH' END O' T' LAITH IF YE WENT TO SPAKE TO HIM
'IS THERE NOBODY INSIDE TO OPEN THE DOOR I HALLOOED RESPONSIVELY
'THERE'S NOBBUT T' MISSIS AND SHOO'LL NOT OPPEN 'T AN YE MAK' YER
FLAYSOME DINS TILL NEEGHT
'WHY CANNOT YOU TELL HER WHOM I AM EH JOSEPH
'NOR NE ME I'LL HAE NO HEND WI'T MUTTERED THE HEAD VANISHING
THE SNOW BEGAN TO DRIVE THICKLY
I SEIZED THE HANDLE TO ESSAY ANOTHER
TRIAL WHEN A YOUNG MAN WITHOUT COAT AND SHOULDERING A PITCHFORK
APPEARED IN THE YARD BEHIND
HE HAILED ME TO FOLLOW HIM AND AFTER
MARCHING THROUGH A WASH HOUSE AND A PAVED AREA CONTAINING A COAL SHED
PUMP AND PIGEON COT WE AT LENGTH ARRIVED IN THE HUGE WARM CHEERFUL
APARTMENT WHERE I WAS FORMERLY RECEIVED
IT GLOWED DELIGHTFULLY IN THE
RADIANCE OF AN IMMENSE FIRE COMPOUNDED OF COAL PEAT AND WOOD AND NEAR
THE TABLE LAID FOR A PLENTIFUL EVENING MEAL I WAS PLEASED TO OBSERVE
THE 'MISSIS AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE EXISTENCE I HAD NEVER PREVIOUSLY
SUSPECTED
I BOWED AND WAITED THINKING SHE WOULD BID ME TAKE A SEAT
SHE LOOKED AT ME LEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR AND REMAINED MOTIONLESS AND
MUTE
'ROUGH WEATHER I REMARKED
'I'M AFRAID MRS
HEATHCLIFF THE DOOR MUST
BEAR THE CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR SERVANTS' LEISURE ATTENDANCE I HAD HARD
WORK TO MAKE THEM HEAR ME
SHE NEVER OPENED HER MOUTH
I STARED SHE STARED ALSO AT ANY RATE SHE
KEPT HER EYES ON ME IN A COOL REGARDLESS MANNER EXCEEDINGLY
EMBARRASSING AND DISAGREEABLE
'SIT DOWN SAID THE YOUNG MAN GRUFFLY
'HE'LL BE IN SOON
I OBEYED AND HEMMED AND CALLED THE VILLAIN JUNO WHO DEIGNED AT THIS
SECOND INTERVIEW TO MOVE THE EXTREME TIP OF HER TAIL IN TOKEN OF OWNING
MY ACQUAINTANCE
'A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL I COMMENCED AGAIN
'DO YOU INTEND PARTING WITH THE
LITTLE ONES MADAM
'THEY ARE NOT MINE SAID THE AMIABLE HOSTESS MORE REPELLINGLY THAN
HEATHCLIFF HIMSELF COULD HAVE REPLIED
'AH YOUR FAVOURITES ARE AMONG THESE I CONTINUED TURNING TO AN OBSCURE
CUSHION FULL OF SOMETHING LIKE CATS
'A STRANGE CHOICE OF FAVOURITES SHE OBSERVED SCORNFULLY
UNLUCKILY IT WAS A HEAP OF DEAD RABBITS
I HEMMED ONCE MORE AND DREW
CLOSER TO THE HEARTH REPEATING MY COMMENT ON THE WILDNESS OF THE
EVENING
'YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE COME OUT SHE SAID RISING AND REACHING FROM THE
CHIMNEY PIECE TWO OF THE PAINTED CANISTERS
HER POSITION BEFORE WAS SHELTERED FROM THE LIGHT NOW I HAD A DISTINCT
VIEW OF HER WHOLE FIGURE AND COUNTENANCE
SHE WAS SLENDER AND
APPARENTLY SCARCELY PAST GIRLHOOD AN ADMIRABLE FORM AND THE MOST
EXQUISITE LITTLE FACE THAT I HAVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEHOLDING
SMALL FEATURES VERY FAIR FLAXEN RINGLETS OR RATHER GOLDEN HANGING
LOOSE ON HER DELICATE NECK AND EYES HAD THEY BEEN AGREEABLE IN
EXPRESSION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IRRESISTIBLE FORTUNATELY FOR MY
SUSCEPTIBLE HEART THE ONLY SENTIMENT THEY EVINCED HOVERED BETWEEN SCORN
AND A KIND OF DESPERATION SINGULARLY UNNATURAL TO BE DETECTED THERE
THE
CANISTERS WERE ALMOST OUT OF HER REACH I MADE A MOTION TO AID HER SHE
TURNED UPON ME AS A MISER MIGHT TURN IF ANY ONE ATTEMPTED TO ASSIST HIM
IN COUNTING HIS GOLD
'I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP SHE SNAPPED 'I CAN GET THEM FOR MYSELF
'I BEG YOUR PARDON I HASTENED TO REPLY
'WERE YOU ASKED TO TEA SHE DEMANDED TYING AN APRON OVER HER NEAT BLACK
FROCK AND STANDING WITH A SPOONFUL OF THE LEAF POISED OVER THE POT
'I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE A CUP I ANSWERED
'WERE YOU ASKED SHE REPEATED
'NO I SAID HALF SMILING
'YOU ARE THE PROPER PERSON TO ASK ME
SHE FLUNG THE TEA BACK SPOON AND ALL AND RESUMED HER CHAIR IN A PET
HER FOREHEAD CORRUGATED AND HER RED UNDER LIP PUSHED OUT LIKE A CHILD'S
READY TO CRY
MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD SLUNG ON TO HIS PERSON A DECIDEDLY SHABBY
UPPER GARMENT AND ERECTING HIMSELF BEFORE THE BLAZE LOOKED DOWN ON ME
FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYES FOR ALL THE WORLD AS IF THERE WERE SOME
MORTAL FEUD UNAVENGED BETWEEN US
I BEGAN TO DOUBT WHETHER HE WERE A
SERVANT OR NOT HIS DRESS AND SPEECH WERE BOTH RUDE ENTIRELY DEVOID OF
THE SUPERIORITY OBSERVABLE IN MR
AND MRS
HEATHCLIFF HIS THICK BROWN
CURLS WERE ROUGH AND UNCULTIVATED HIS WHISKERS ENCROACHED BEARISHLY OVER
HIS CHEEKS AND HIS HANDS WERE EMBROWNED LIKE THOSE OF A COMMON LABOURER
STILL HIS BEARING WAS FREE ALMOST HAUGHTY AND HE SHOWED NONE OF A
DOMESTIC'S ASSIDUITY IN ATTENDING ON THE LADY OF THE HOUSE
IN THE
ABSENCE OF CLEAR PROOFS OF HIS CONDITION I DEEMED IT BEST TO ABSTAIN
FROM NOTICING HIS CURIOUS CONDUCT AND FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE
ENTRANCE OF HEATHCLIFF RELIEVED ME IN SOME MEASURE FROM MY
UNCOMFORTABLE STATE
'YOU SEE SIR I AM COME ACCORDING TO PROMISE I EXCLAIMED ASSUMING
THE CHEERFUL 'AND I FEAR I SHALL BE WEATHER BOUND FOR HALF AN HOUR IF
YOU CAN AFFORD ME SHELTER DURING THAT SPACE
'HALF AN HOUR HE SAID SHAKING THE WHITE FLAKES FROM HIS CLOTHES 'I
WONDER YOU SHOULD SELECT THE THICK OF A SNOW STORM TO RAMBLE ABOUT IN
DO
YOU KNOW THAT YOU RUN A RISK OF BEING LOST IN THE MARSHES PEOPLE
FAMILIAR WITH THESE MOORS OFTEN MISS THEIR ROAD ON SUCH EVENINGS AND I
CAN TELL YOU THERE IS NO CHANCE OF A CHANGE AT PRESENT
'PERHAPS I CAN GET A GUIDE AMONG YOUR LADS AND HE MIGHT STAY AT THE
GRANGE TILL MORNING COULD YOU SPARE ME ONE
'NO I COULD NOT
'OH INDEED WELL THEN I MUST TRUST TO MY OWN SAGACITY
'UMPH
'ARE YOU GOING TO MAK' THE TEA DEMANDED HE OF THE SHABBY COAT SHIFTING
HIS FEROCIOUS GAZE FROM ME TO THE YOUNG LADY
'IS HE TO HAVE ANY SHE ASKED APPEALING TO HEATHCLIFF
'GET IT READY WILL YOU WAS THE ANSWER UTTERED SO SAVAGELY THAT I
STARTED
THE TONE IN WHICH THE WORDS WERE SAID REVEALED A GENUINE BAD
NATURE
I NO LONGER FELT INCLINED TO CALL HEATHCLIFF A CAPITAL FELLOW
WHEN THE PREPARATIONS WERE FINISHED HE INVITED ME WITH 'NOW SIR BRING
FORWARD YOUR CHAIR AND WE ALL INCLUDING THE RUSTIC YOUTH DREW ROUND
THE TABLE AN AUSTERE SILENCE PREVAILING WHILE WE DISCUSSED OUR MEAL
I THOUGHT IF I HAD CAUSED THE CLOUD IT WAS MY DUTY TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO
DISPEL IT
THEY COULD NOT EVERY DAY SIT SO GRIM AND TACITURN AND IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER ILL TEMPERED THEY MIGHT BE THAT THE UNIVERSAL SCOWL
THEY WORE WAS THEIR EVERY DAY COUNTENANCE
'IT IS STRANGE I BEGAN IN THE INTERVAL OF SWALLOWING ONE CUP OF TEA
AND RECEIVING ANOTHER 'IT IS STRANGE HOW CUSTOM CAN MOULD OUR TASTES AND
IDEAS MANY COULD NOT IMAGINE THE EXISTENCE OF HAPPINESS IN A LIFE OF
SUCH COMPLETE EXILE FROM THE WORLD AS YOU SPEND MR
HEATHCLIFF YET
I'LL VENTURE TO SAY THAT SURROUNDED BY YOUR FAMILY AND WITH YOUR
AMIABLE LADY AS THE PRESIDING GENIUS OVER YOUR HOME AND HEART
'MY AMIABLE LADY HE INTERRUPTED WITH AN ALMOST DIABOLICAL SNEER ON HIS
FACE
'WHERE IS SHE MY AMIABLE LADY
'MRS
HEATHCLIFF YOUR WIFE I MEAN
'WELL YES OH YOU WOULD INTIMATE THAT HER SPIRIT HAS TAKEN THE POST OF
MINISTERING ANGEL AND GUARDS THE FORTUNES OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS EVEN
WHEN HER BODY IS GONE
IS THAT IT
PERCEIVING MYSELF IN A BLUNDER I ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT IT
I MIGHT HAVE
SEEN THERE WAS TOO GREAT A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE AGES OF THE PARTIES TO
MAKE IT LIKELY THAT THEY WERE MAN AND WIFE
ONE WAS ABOUT FORTY A
PERIOD OF MENTAL VIGOUR AT WHICH MEN SELDOM CHERISH THE DELUSION OF BEING
MARRIED FOR LOVE BY GIRLS THAT DREAM IS RESERVED FOR THE SOLACE OF OUR
DECLINING YEARS
THE OTHER DID NOT LOOK SEVENTEEN
THEN IT FLASHED UPON ME 'THE CLOWN AT MY ELBOW WHO IS DRINKING HIS TEA
OUT OF A BASIN AND EATING HIS BREAD WITH UNWASHED HANDS MAY BE HER
HUSBAND HEATHCLIFF JUNIOR OF COURSE
HERE IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING
BURIED ALIVE SHE HAS THROWN HERSELF AWAY UPON THAT BOOR FROM SHEER
IGNORANCE THAT BETTER INDIVIDUALS EXISTED A SAD PITY I MUST BEWARE HOW
I CAUSE HER TO REGRET HER CHOICE THE LAST REFLECTION MAY SEEM
CONCEITED IT WAS NOT
MY NEIGHBOUR STRUCK ME AS BORDERING ON REPULSIVE
I KNEW THROUGH EXPERIENCE THAT I WAS TOLERABLY ATTRACTIVE
'MRS
HEATHCLIFF IS MY DAUGHTER IN LAW SAID HEATHCLIFF CORROBORATING
MY SURMISE
HE TURNED AS HE SPOKE A PECULIAR LOOK IN HER DIRECTION A
LOOK OF HATRED UNLESS HE HAS A MOST PERVERSE SET OF FACIAL MUSCLES THAT
WILL NOT LIKE THOSE OF OTHER PEOPLE INTERPRET THE LANGUAGE OF HIS SOUL
'AH CERTAINLY I SEE NOW YOU ARE THE FAVOURED POSSESSOR OF THE
BENEFICENT FAIRY I REMARKED TURNING TO MY NEIGHBOUR
THIS WAS WORSE THAN BEFORE THE YOUTH GREW CRIMSON AND CLENCHED HIS
FIST WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF A MEDITATED ASSAULT
BUT HE SEEMED TO
RECOLLECT HIMSELF PRESENTLY AND SMOTHERED THE STORM IN A BRUTAL CURSE
MUTTERED ON MY BEHALF WHICH HOWEVER I TOOK CARE NOT TO NOTICE
'UNHAPPY IN YOUR CONJECTURES SIR OBSERVED MY HOST 'WE NEITHER OF US
HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF OWNING YOUR GOOD FAIRY HER MATE IS DEAD
I SAID
SHE WAS MY DAUGHTER IN LAW THEREFORE SHE MUST HAVE MARRIED MY SON
'AND THIS YOUNG MAN IS
'NOT MY SON ASSUREDLY
HEATHCLIFF SMILED AGAIN AS IF IT WERE RATHER TOO BOLD A JEST TO
ATTRIBUTE THE PATERNITY OF THAT BEAR TO HIM
'MY NAME IS HARETON EARNSHAW GROWLED THE OTHER 'AND I'D COUNSEL YOU TO
RESPECT IT
'I'VE SHOWN NO DISRESPECT WAS MY REPLY LAUGHING INTERNALLY AT THE
DIGNITY WITH WHICH HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF
HE FIXED HIS EYE ON ME LONGER THAN I CARED TO RETURN THE STARE FOR FEAR
I MIGHT BE TEMPTED EITHER TO BOX HIS EARS OR RENDER MY HILARITY AUDIBLE
I BEGAN TO FEEL UNMISTAKABLY OUT OF PLACE IN THAT PLEASANT FAMILY CIRCLE
THE DISMAL SPIRITUAL ATMOSPHERE OVERCAME AND MORE THAN NEUTRALISED THE
GLOWING PHYSICAL COMFORTS ROUND ME AND I RESOLVED TO BE CAUTIOUS HOW I
VENTURED UNDER THOSE RAFTERS A THIRD TIME
THE BUSINESS OF EATING BEING CONCLUDED AND NO ONE UTTERING A WORD OF
SOCIABLE CONVERSATION I APPROACHED A WINDOW TO EXAMINE THE WEATHER
A
SORROWFUL SIGHT I SAW DARK NIGHT COMING DOWN PREMATURELY AND SKY AND
HILLS MINGLED IN ONE BITTER WHIRL OF WIND AND SUFFOCATING SNOW
'I DON'T THINK IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET HOME NOW WITHOUT A GUIDE I
COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING
'THE ROADS WILL BE BURIED ALREADY AND IF
THEY WERE BARE I COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH A FOOT IN ADVANCE
'HARETON DRIVE THOSE DOZEN SHEEP INTO THE BARN PORCH
THEY'LL BE
COVERED IF LEFT IN THE FOLD ALL NIGHT AND PUT A PLANK BEFORE THEM SAID
HEATHCLIFF
'HOW MUST I DO I CONTINUED WITH RISING IRRITATION
THERE WAS NO REPLY TO MY QUESTION AND ON LOOKING ROUND I SAW ONLY JOSEPH
BRINGING IN A PAIL OF PORRIDGE FOR THE DOGS AND MRS
HEATHCLIFF LEANING
OVER THE FIRE DIVERTING HERSELF WITH BURNING A BUNDLE OF MATCHES WHICH
HAD FALLEN FROM THE CHIMNEY PIECE AS SHE RESTORED THE TEA CANISTER TO ITS
PLACE
THE FORMER WHEN HE HAD DEPOSITED HIS BURDEN TOOK A CRITICAL
SURVEY OF THE ROOM AND IN CRACKED TONES GRATED OUT 'AW WONDER HOW YAH
CAN FAISHION TO STAND THEAR I' IDLENESS UN WAR WHEN ALL ON 'EMS GOAN
OUT BUD YAH'RE A NOWT AND IT'S NO USE TALKING YAH'LL NIVER MEND O'YER
ILL WAYS BUT GOA RAIGHT TO T' DIVIL LIKE YER MOTHER AFORE YE
I IMAGINED FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS PIECE OF ELOQUENCE WAS ADDRESSED TO
ME AND SUFFICIENTLY ENRAGED STEPPED TOWARDS THE AGED RASCAL WITH AN
INTENTION OF KICKING HIM OUT OF THE DOOR
MRS
HEATHCLIFF HOWEVER
CHECKED ME BY HER ANSWER
'YOU SCANDALOUS OLD HYPOCRITE SHE REPLIED
'ARE YOU NOT AFRAID OF
BEING CARRIED AWAY BODILY WHENEVER YOU MENTION THE DEVIL'S NAME I WARN
YOU TO REFRAIN FROM PROVOKING ME OR I'LL ASK YOUR ABDUCTION AS A SPECIAL
FAVOUR STOP LOOK HERE JOSEPH SHE CONTINUED TAKING A LONG DARK
BOOK FROM A SHELF 'I'LL SHOW YOU HOW FAR I'VE PROGRESSED IN THE BLACK
ART I SHALL SOON BE COMPETENT TO MAKE A CLEAR HOUSE OF IT
THE RED COW
DIDN'T DIE BY CHANCE AND YOUR RHEUMATISM CAN HARDLY BE RECKONED AMONG
PROVIDENTIAL VISITATIONS
'OH WICKED WICKED GASPED THE ELDER 'MAY THE LORD DELIVER US FROM
EVIL
'NO REPROBATE YOU ARE A CASTAWAY BE OFF OR I'LL HURT YOU SERIOUSLY
I'LL HAVE YOU ALL MODELLED IN WAX AND CLAY AND THE FIRST WHO PASSES THE
LIMITS I FIX SHALL I'LL NOT SAY WHAT HE SHALL BE DONE TO BUT YOU'LL
SEE GO I'M LOOKING AT YOU
THE LITTLE WITCH PUT A MOCK MALIGNITY INTO HER BEAUTIFUL EYES AND
JOSEPH TREMBLING WITH SINCERE HORROR HURRIED OUT PRAYING AND
EJACULATING 'WICKED' AS HE WENT
I THOUGHT HER CONDUCT MUST BE PROMPTED
BY A SPECIES OF DREARY FUN AND NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE I ENDEAVOURED TO
INTEREST HER IN MY DISTRESS
'MRS
HEATHCLIFF I SAID EARNESTLY 'YOU MUST EXCUSE ME FOR TROUBLING
YOU
I PRESUME BECAUSE WITH THAT FACE I'M SURE YOU CANNOT HELP BEING
GOOD HEARTED
DO POINT OUT SOME LANDMARKS BY WHICH I MAY KNOW MY WAY
HOME I HAVE NO MORE IDEA HOW TO GET THERE THAN YOU WOULD HAVE HOW TO GET
TO LONDON
'TAKE THE ROAD YOU CAME SHE ANSWERED ENSCONCING HERSELF IN A CHAIR
WITH A CANDLE AND THE LONG BOOK OPEN BEFORE HER
'IT IS BRIEF ADVICE
BUT AS SOUND AS I CAN GIVE
'THEN IF YOU HEAR OF ME BEING DISCOVERED DEAD IN A BOG OR A PIT FULL OF
SNOW YOUR CONSCIENCE WON'T WHISPER THAT IT IS PARTLY YOUR FAULT
'HOW SO I CANNOT ESCORT YOU
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME GO TO THE END OF THE
GARDEN WALL
YOU I SHOULD BE SORRY TO ASK YOU TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD FOR MY
CONVENIENCE ON SUCH A NIGHT I CRIED
'I WANT YOU TO TELL ME MY WAY
NOT TO SHOW IT OR ELSE TO PERSUADE MR
HEATHCLIFF TO GIVE ME A GUIDE
'WHO THERE IS HIMSELF EARNSHAW ZILLAH JOSEPH AND I
WHICH WOULD YOU
HAVE
'ARE THERE NO BOYS AT THE FARM
'NO THOSE ARE ALL
'THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT I AM COMPELLED TO STAY
'THAT YOU MAY SETTLE WITH YOUR HOST
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT
'I HOPE IT WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU TO MAKE NO MORE RASH JOURNEYS ON THESE
HILLS CRIED HEATHCLIFF'S STERN VOICE FROM THE KITCHEN ENTRANCE
'AS TO
STAYING HERE I DON'T KEEP ACCOMMODATIONS FOR VISITORS YOU MUST SHARE A
BED WITH HARETON OR JOSEPH IF YOU DO
'I CAN SLEEP ON A CHAIR IN THIS ROOM I REPLIED
'NO NO A STRANGER IS A STRANGER BE HE RICH OR POOR IT WILL NOT SUIT
ME TO PERMIT ANY ONE THE RANGE OF THE PLACE WHILE I AM OFF GUARD SAID
THE UNMANNERLY WRETCH
WITH THIS INSULT MY PATIENCE WAS AT AN END
I UTTERED AN EXPRESSION OF
DISGUST AND PUSHED PAST HIM INTO THE YARD RUNNING AGAINST EARNSHAW IN
MY HASTE
IT WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD NOT SEE THE MEANS OF EXIT AND AS
I WANDERED ROUND I HEARD ANOTHER SPECIMEN OF THEIR CIVIL BEHAVIOUR
AMONGST EACH OTHER
AT FIRST THE YOUNG MAN APPEARED ABOUT TO BEFRIEND
ME
'I'LL GO WITH HIM AS FAR AS THE PARK HE SAID
'YOU'LL GO WITH HIM TO HELL EXCLAIMED HIS MASTER OR WHATEVER RELATION
HE BORE
'AND WHO IS TO LOOK AFTER THE HORSES EH
'A MAN'S LIFE IS OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN ONE EVENING'S NEGLECT OF THE
HORSES SOMEBODY MUST GO MURMURED MRS
HEATHCLIFF MORE KINDLY THAN I
EXPECTED
'NOT AT YOUR COMMAND RETORTED HARETON
'IF YOU SET STORE ON HIM YOU'D
BETTER BE QUIET
'THEN I HOPE HIS GHOST WILL HAUNT YOU AND I HOPE MR
HEATHCLIFF WILL
NEVER GET ANOTHER TENANT TILL THE GRANGE IS A RUIN SHE ANSWERED
SHARPLY
'HEARKEN HEARKEN SHOO'S CURSING ON 'EM MUTTERED JOSEPH TOWARDS WHOM
I HAD BEEN STEERING
HE SAT WITHIN EARSHOT MILKING THE COWS BY THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN WHICH
I SEIZED UNCEREMONIOUSLY AND CALLING OUT THAT I WOULD SEND IT BACK ON
THE MORROW RUSHED TO THE NEAREST POSTERN
'MAISTER MAISTER HE'S STALING T' LANTHERN SHOUTED THE ANCIENT
PURSUING MY RETREAT
'HEY GNASHER HEY DOG HEY WOLF HOLLD HIM
HOLLD HIM
ON OPENING THE LITTLE DOOR TWO HAIRY MONSTERS FLEW AT MY THROAT BEARING
ME DOWN AND EXTINGUISHING THE LIGHT WHILE A MINGLED GUFFAW FROM
HEATHCLIFF AND HARETON PUT THE COPESTONE ON MY RAGE AND HUMILIATION
FORTUNATELY THE BEASTS SEEMED MORE BENT ON STRETCHING THEIR PAWS AND
YAWNING AND FLOURISHING THEIR TAILS THAN DEVOURING ME ALIVE BUT THEY
WOULD SUFFER NO RESURRECTION AND I WAS FORCED TO LIE TILL THEIR
MALIGNANT MASTERS PLEASED TO DELIVER ME THEN HATLESS AND TREMBLING WITH
WRATH I ORDERED THE MISCREANTS TO LET ME OUT ON THEIR PERIL TO KEEP ME
ONE MINUTE LONGER WITH SEVERAL INCOHERENT THREATS OF RETALIATION THAT
IN THEIR INDEFINITE DEPTH OF VIRULENCY SMACKED OF KING LEAR
THE VEHEMENCE OF MY AGITATION BROUGHT ON A COPIOUS BLEEDING AT THE NOSE
AND STILL HEATHCLIFF LAUGHED AND STILL I SCOLDED
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THE SCENE HAD THERE NOT BEEN ONE PERSON AT HAND
RATHER MORE RATIONAL THAN MYSELF AND MORE BENEVOLENT THAN MY
ENTERTAINER
THIS WAS ZILLAH THE STOUT HOUSEWIFE WHO AT LENGTH ISSUED
FORTH TO INQUIRE INTO THE NATURE OF THE UPROAR
SHE THOUGHT THAT SOME OF
THEM HAD BEEN LAYING VIOLENT HANDS ON ME AND NOT DARING TO ATTACK HER
MASTER SHE TURNED HER VOCAL ARTILLERY AGAINST THE YOUNGER SCOUNDREL
'WELL MR
EARNSHAW SHE CRIED 'I WONDER WHAT YOU'LL HAVE AGAIT NEXT
ARE WE GOING TO MURDER FOLK ON OUR VERY DOOR STONES I SEE THIS HOUSE
WILL NEVER DO FOR ME LOOK AT T' POOR LAD HE'S FAIR CHOKING WISHT
WISHT YOU MUN'N'T GO ON SO
COME IN AND I'LL CURE THAT THERE NOW
HOLD YE STILL
WITH THESE WORDS SHE SUDDENLY SPLASHED A PINT OF ICY WATER DOWN MY NECK
AND PULLED ME INTO THE KITCHEN
MR
HEATHCLIFF FOLLOWED HIS ACCIDENTAL
MERRIMENT EXPIRING QUICKLY IN HIS HABITUAL MOROSENESS
I WAS SICK EXCEEDINGLY AND DIZZY AND FAINT AND THUS COMPELLED PERFORCE
TO ACCEPT LODGINGS UNDER HIS ROOF
HE TOLD ZILLAH TO GIVE ME A GLASS OF
BRANDY AND THEN PASSED ON TO THE INNER ROOM WHILE SHE CONDOLED WITH ME
ON MY SORRY PREDICAMENT AND HAVING OBEYED HIS ORDERS WHEREBY I WAS
SOMEWHAT REVIVED USHERED ME TO BED
CHAPTER III
WHILE LEADING THE WAY UPSTAIRS SHE RECOMMENDED THAT I SHOULD HIDE THE
CANDLE AND NOT MAKE A NOISE FOR HER MASTER HAD AN ODD NOTION ABOUT THE
CHAMBER SHE WOULD PUT ME IN AND NEVER LET ANYBODY LODGE THERE WILLINGLY
I ASKED THE REASON
SHE DID NOT KNOW SHE ANSWERED SHE HAD ONLY LIVED
THERE A YEAR OR TWO AND THEY HAD SO MANY QUEER GOINGS ON SHE COULD NOT
BEGIN TO BE CURIOUS
TOO STUPEFIED TO BE CURIOUS MYSELF I FASTENED MY DOOR AND GLANCED ROUND
FOR THE BED
THE WHOLE FURNITURE CONSISTED OF A CHAIR A CLOTHES PRESS
AND A LARGE OAK CASE WITH SQUARES CUT OUT NEAR THE TOP RESEMBLING COACH
WINDOWS
HAVING APPROACHED THIS STRUCTURE I LOOKED INSIDE AND
PERCEIVED IT TO BE A SINGULAR SORT OF OLD FASHIONED COUCH VERY
CONVENIENTLY DESIGNED TO OBVIATE THE NECESSITY FOR EVERY MEMBER OF THE
FAMILY HAVING A ROOM TO HIMSELF
IN FACT IT FORMED A LITTLE CLOSET AND
THE LEDGE OF A WINDOW WHICH IT ENCLOSED SERVED AS A TABLE
I SLID BACK
THE PANELLED SIDES GOT IN WITH MY LIGHT PULLED THEM TOGETHER AGAIN AND
FELT SECURE AGAINST THE VIGILANCE OF HEATHCLIFF AND EVERY ONE ELSE
THE LEDGE WHERE I PLACED MY CANDLE HAD A FEW MILDEWED BOOKS PILED UP IN
ONE CORNER AND IT WAS COVERED WITH WRITING SCRATCHED ON THE PAINT
THIS
WRITING HOWEVER WAS NOTHING BUT A NAME REPEATED IN ALL KINDS OF
CHARACTERS LARGE AND SMALL CATHERINE EARNSHAW HERE AND THERE VARIED
TO CATHERINE HEATHCLIFF AND THEN AGAIN TO CATHERINE LINTON
IN VAPID LISTLESSNESS I LEANT MY HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND CONTINUED
SPELLING OVER CATHERINE EARNSHAW HEATHCLIFF LINTON TILL MY EYES
CLOSED BUT THEY HAD NOT RESTED FIVE MINUTES WHEN A GLARE OF WHITE
LETTERS STARTED FROM THE DARK AS VIVID AS SPECTRES THE AIR SWARMED WITH
CATHERINES AND ROUSING MYSELF TO DISPEL THE OBTRUSIVE NAME I DISCOVERED
MY CANDLE WICK RECLINING ON ONE OF THE ANTIQUE VOLUMES AND PERFUMING THE
PLACE WITH AN ODOUR OF ROASTED CALF SKIN
I SNUFFED IT OFF AND VERY
ILL AT EASE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF COLD AND LINGERING NAUSEA SAT UP AND
SPREAD OPEN THE INJURED TOME ON MY KNEE
IT WAS A TESTAMENT IN LEAN
TYPE AND SMELLING DREADFULLY MUSTY A FLY LEAF BORE THE
INSCRIPTION 'CATHERINE EARNSHAW HER BOOK AND A DATE SOME QUARTER OF A
CENTURY BACK
I SHUT IT AND TOOK UP ANOTHER AND ANOTHER TILL I HAD
EXAMINED ALL
CATHERINE'S LIBRARY WAS SELECT AND ITS STATE OF
DILAPIDATION PROVED IT TO HAVE BEEN WELL USED THOUGH NOT ALTOGETHER FOR
A LEGITIMATE PURPOSE SCARCELY ONE CHAPTER HAD ESCAPED A PEN AND INK
COMMENTARY AT LEAST THE APPEARANCE OF ONE COVERING EVERY MORSEL OF
BLANK THAT THE PRINTER HAD LEFT
SOME WERE DETACHED SENTENCES OTHER
PARTS TOOK THE FORM OF A REGULAR DIARY SCRAWLED IN AN UNFORMED CHILDISH
HAND
AT THE TOP OF AN EXTRA PAGE QUITE A TREASURE PROBABLY WHEN
FIRST LIGHTED ON I WAS GREATLY AMUSED TO BEHOLD AN EXCELLENT CARICATURE
OF MY FRIEND JOSEPH RUDELY YET POWERFULLY SKETCHED
AN IMMEDIATE
INTEREST KINDLED WITHIN ME FOR THE UNKNOWN CATHERINE AND I BEGAN
FORTHWITH TO DECIPHER HER FADED HIEROGLYPHICS
'AN AWFUL SUNDAY COMMENCED THE PARAGRAPH BENEATH
'I WISH MY FATHER
WERE BACK AGAIN
HINDLEY IS A DETESTABLE SUBSTITUTE HIS CONDUCT TO
HEATHCLIFF IS ATROCIOUS H
AND I ARE GOING TO REBEL WE TOOK OUR
INITIATORY STEP THIS EVENING
'ALL DAY HAD BEEN FLOODING WITH RAIN WE COULD NOT GO TO CHURCH SO
JOSEPH MUST NEEDS GET UP A CONGREGATION IN THE GARRET AND WHILE HINDLEY
AND HIS WIFE BASKED DOWNSTAIRS BEFORE A COMFORTABLE FIRE DOING ANYTHING
BUT READING THEIR BIBLES I'LL ANSWER FOR IT HEATHCLIFF MYSELF AND THE
UNHAPPY PLOUGHBOY WERE COMMANDED TO TAKE OUR PRAYER BOOKS AND MOUNT WE
WERE RANGED IN A ROW ON A SACK OF CORN GROANING AND SHIVERING AND
HOPING THAT JOSEPH WOULD SHIVER TOO SO THAT HE MIGHT GIVE US A SHORT
HOMILY FOR HIS OWN SAKE
A VAIN IDEA THE SERVICE LASTED PRECISELY
THREE HOURS AND YET MY BROTHER HAD THE FACE TO EXCLAIM WHEN HE SAW US
DESCENDING WHAT DONE ALREADY ON SUNDAY EVENINGS WE USED TO BE
PERMITTED TO PLAY IF WE DID NOT MAKE MUCH NOISE NOW A MERE TITTER IS
SUFFICIENT TO SEND US INTO CORNERS
YOU FORGET YOU HAVE A MASTER HERE SAYS THE TYRANT
I'LL DEMOLISH
THE FIRST WHO PUTS ME OUT OF TEMPER I INSIST ON PERFECT SOBRIETY AND
SILENCE
OH BOY WAS THAT YOU FRANCES DARLING PULL HIS HAIR AS YOU
GO BY I HEARD HIM SNAP HIS FINGERS FRANCES PULLED HIS HAIR HEARTILY
AND THEN WENT AND SEATED HERSELF ON HER HUSBAND'S KNEE AND THERE THEY
WERE LIKE TWO BABIES KISSING AND TALKING NONSENSE BY THE HOUR FOOLISH
PALAVER THAT WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF
WE MADE OURSELVES AS SNUG AS OUR
MEANS ALLOWED IN THE ARCH OF THE DRESSER
I HAD JUST FASTENED OUR
PINAFORES TOGETHER AND HUNG THEM UP FOR A CURTAIN WHEN IN COMES JOSEPH
ON AN ERRAND FROM THE STABLES
HE TEARS DOWN MY HANDIWORK BOXES MY
EARS AND CROAKS
T' MAISTER NOBBUT JUST BURIED AND SABBATH NOT O'ERED UND T' SOUND O'
T' GOSPEL STILL I' YER LUGS AND YE DARR BE LAIKING SHAME ON YE SIT YE
DOWN ILL CHILDER THERE'S GOOD BOOKS ENEUGH IF YE'LL READ 'EM SIT YE
DOWN AND THINK O' YER SOWLS
'SAYING THIS HE COMPELLED US SO TO SQUARE OUR POSITIONS THAT WE MIGHT
RECEIVE FROM THE FAR OFF FIRE A DULL RAY TO SHOW US THE TEXT OF THE
LUMBER HE THRUST UPON US
I COULD NOT BEAR THE EMPLOYMENT
I TOOK MY
DINGY VOLUME BY THE SCROOP AND HURLED IT INTO THE DOG KENNEL VOWING I
HATED A GOOD BOOK
HEATHCLIFF KICKED HIS TO THE SAME PLACE
THEN THERE
WAS A HUBBUB
MAISTER HINDLEY SHOUTED OUR CHAPLAIN
MAISTER COOM HITHER MISS
CATHY'S RIVEN TH' BACK OFF 'TH' HELMET O' SALVATION UN' HEATHCLIFF'S
PAWSED HIS FIT INTO T' FIRST PART O' 'T' BROOAD WAY TO DESTRUCTION IT'S
FAIR FLAYSOME THAT YE LET 'EM GO ON THIS GAIT
ECH TH' OWD MAN WAD HA'
LACED 'EM PROPERLY BUT HE'S GOAN
'HINDLEY HURRIED UP FROM HIS PARADISE ON THE HEARTH AND SEIZING ONE OF
US BY THE COLLAR AND THE OTHER BY THE ARM HURLED BOTH INTO THE
BACK KITCHEN WHERE JOSEPH ASSEVERATED OWD NICK WOULD FETCH US AS
SURE AS WE WERE LIVING AND SO COMFORTED WE EACH SOUGHT A SEPARATE
NOOK TO AWAIT HIS ADVENT
I REACHED THIS BOOK AND A POT OF INK FROM A
SHELF AND PUSHED THE HOUSE DOOR AJAR TO GIVE ME LIGHT AND I HAVE GOT
THE TIME ON WITH WRITING FOR TWENTY MINUTES BUT MY COMPANION IS
IMPATIENT AND PROPOSES THAT WE SHOULD APPROPRIATE THE DAIRYWOMAN'S
CLOAK AND HAVE A SCAMPER ON THE MOORS UNDER ITS SHELTER
A PLEASANT
SUGGESTION AND THEN IF THE SURLY OLD MAN COME IN HE MAY BELIEVE HIS
PROPHECY VERIFIED WE CANNOT BE DAMPER OR COLDER IN THE RAIN THAN WE
ARE HERE
I SUPPOSE CATHERINE FULFILLED HER PROJECT FOR THE NEXT SENTENCE TOOK UP
ANOTHER SUBJECT SHE WAXED LACHRYMOSE
'HOW LITTLE DID I DREAM THAT HINDLEY WOULD EVER MAKE ME CRY SO SHE
WROTE
'MY HEAD ACHES TILL I CANNOT KEEP IT ON THE PILLOW AND STILL I
CAN'T GIVE OVER
POOR HEATHCLIFF HINDLEY CALLS HIM A VAGABOND AND
WON'T LET HIM SIT WITH US NOR EAT WITH US ANY MORE AND HE SAYS HE AND
I MUST NOT PLAY TOGETHER AND THREATENS TO TURN HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE IF
WE BREAK HIS ORDERS
HE HAS BEEN BLAMING OUR FATHER HOW DARED HE FOR
TREATING H
TOO LIBERALLY AND SWEARS HE WILL REDUCE HIM TO HIS RIGHT
PLACE
I BEGAN TO NOD DROWSILY OVER THE DIM PAGE MY EYE WANDERED FROM
MANUSCRIPT TO PRINT
I SAW A RED ORNAMENTED TITLE 'SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN
AND THE FIRST OF THE SEVENTY FIRST
A PIOUS DISCOURSE DELIVERED BY THE
REVEREND JABEZ BRANDERHAM IN THE CHAPEL OF GIMMERDEN SOUGH AND WHILE
I WAS HALF CONSCIOUSLY WORRYING MY BRAIN TO GUESS WHAT JABEZ BRANDERHAM
WOULD MAKE OF HIS SUBJECT I SANK BACK IN BED AND FELL ASLEEP
ALAS
FOR THE EFFECTS OF BAD TEA AND BAD TEMPER WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE THAT
MADE ME PASS SUCH A TERRIBLE NIGHT I DON'T REMEMBER ANOTHER THAT I CAN
AT ALL COMPARE WITH IT SINCE I WAS CAPABLE OF SUFFERING
I BEGAN TO DREAM ALMOST BEFORE I CEASED TO BE SENSIBLE OF MY LOCALITY
I
THOUGHT IT WAS MORNING AND I HAD SET OUT ON MY WAY HOME WITH JOSEPH FOR
A GUIDE
THE SNOW LAY YARDS DEEP IN OUR ROAD AND AS WE FLOUNDERED ON
MY COMPANION WEARIED ME WITH CONSTANT REPROACHES THAT I HAD NOT BROUGHT A
PILGRIM'S STAFF TELLING ME THAT I COULD NEVER GET INTO THE HOUSE WITHOUT
ONE AND BOASTFULLY FLOURISHING A HEAVY HEADED CUDGEL WHICH I UNDERSTOOD
TO BE SO DENOMINATED
FOR A MOMENT I CONSIDERED IT ABSURD THAT I SHOULD
NEED SUCH A WEAPON TO GAIN ADMITTANCE INTO MY OWN RESIDENCE
THEN A NEW
IDEA FLASHED ACROSS ME
I WAS NOT GOING THERE WE WERE JOURNEYING TO
HEAR THE FAMOUS JABEZ BRANDERHAM PREACH FROM THE TEXT 'SEVENTY TIMES
SEVEN AND EITHER JOSEPH THE PREACHER OR I HAD COMMITTED THE 'FIRST OF
THE SEVENTY FIRST AND WERE TO BE PUBLICLY EXPOSED AND EXCOMMUNICATED
WE CAME TO THE CHAPEL
I HAVE PASSED IT REALLY IN MY WALKS TWICE OR
THRICE IT LIES IN A HOLLOW BETWEEN TWO HILLS AN ELEVATED HOLLOW NEAR
A SWAMP WHOSE PEATY MOISTURE IS SAID TO ANSWER ALL THE PURPOSES OF
EMBALMING ON THE FEW CORPSES DEPOSITED THERE
THE ROOF HAS BEEN KEPT
WHOLE HITHERTO BUT AS THE CLERGYMAN'S STIPEND IS ONLY TWENTY POUNDS PER
ANNUM AND A HOUSE WITH TWO ROOMS THREATENING SPEEDILY TO DETERMINE INTO
ONE NO CLERGYMAN WILL UNDERTAKE THE DUTIES OF PASTOR ESPECIALLY AS IT
IS CURRENTLY REPORTED THAT HIS FLOCK WOULD RATHER LET HIM STARVE THAN
INCREASE THE LIVING BY ONE PENNY FROM THEIR OWN POCKETS
HOWEVER IN MY
DREAM JABEZ HAD A FULL AND ATTENTIVE CONGREGATION AND HE PREACHED GOOD
GOD WHAT A SERMON DIVIDED INTO FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY PARTS EACH
FULLY EQUAL TO AN ORDINARY ADDRESS FROM THE PULPIT AND EACH DISCUSSING A
SEPARATE SIN WHERE HE SEARCHED FOR THEM I CANNOT TELL
HE HAD HIS
PRIVATE MANNER OF INTERPRETING THE PHRASE AND IT SEEMED NECESSARY THE
BROTHER SHOULD SIN DIFFERENT SINS ON EVERY OCCASION
THEY WERE OF THE
MOST CURIOUS CHARACTER ODD TRANSGRESSIONS THAT I NEVER IMAGINED
PREVIOUSLY
OH HOW WEARY I GROW
HOW I WRITHED AND YAWNED AND NODDED AND
REVIVED HOW I PINCHED AND PRICKED MYSELF AND RUBBED MY EYES AND STOOD
UP AND SAT DOWN AGAIN AND NUDGED JOSEPH TO INFORM ME IF HE WOULD EVER
HAVE DONE
I WAS CONDEMNED TO HEAR ALL OUT FINALLY HE REACHED THE FIRST OF THE SEVENTY FIRST AT THAT CRISIS A SUDDEN INSPIRATION
DESCENDED ON ME I WAS MOVED TO RISE AND DENOUNCE JABEZ BRANDERHAM AS THE
SINNER OF THE SIN THAT NO CHRISTIAN NEED PARDON
'SIR I EXCLAIMED 'SITTING HERE WITHIN THESE FOUR WALLS AT ONE
STRETCH I HAVE ENDURED AND FORGIVEN THE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY HEADS OF
YOUR DISCOURSE
SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN TIMES HAVE I PLUCKED UP MY HAT AND
BEEN ABOUT TO DEPART SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN TIMES HAVE YOU PREPOSTEROUSLY
FORCED ME TO RESUME MY SEAT
THE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY FIRST IS TOO
MUCH
FELLOW MARTYRS HAVE AT HIM DRAG HIM DOWN AND CRUSH HIM TO
ATOMS THAT THE PLACE WHICH KNOWS HIM MAY KNOW HIM NO MORE
THOU ART THE MAN CRIED JABEZ AFTER A SOLEMN PAUSE LEANING OVER HIS
CUSHION
'SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN TIMES DIDST THOU GAPINGLY CONTORT THY
VISAGE SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN DID I TAKE COUNSEL WITH MY SOUL LO THIS IS
HUMAN WEAKNESS THIS ALSO MAY BE ABSOLVED THE FIRST OF THE
SEVENTY FIRST IS COME
BRETHREN EXECUTE UPON HIM THE JUDGMENT WRITTEN
SUCH HONOUR HAVE ALL HIS SAINTS
WITH THAT CONCLUDING WORD THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY EXALTING THEIR PILGRIM'S
STAVES RUSHED ROUND ME IN A BODY AND I HAVING NO WEAPON TO RAISE IN
SELF DEFENCE COMMENCED GRAPPLING WITH JOSEPH MY NEAREST AND MOST
FEROCIOUS ASSAILANT FOR HIS
IN THE CONFLUENCE OF THE MULTITUDE
SEVERAL CLUBS CROSSED BLOWS AIMED AT ME FELL ON OTHER SCONCES
PRESENTLY THE WHOLE CHAPEL RESOUNDED WITH RAPPINGS AND COUNTER RAPPINGS
EVERY MAN'S HAND WAS AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOUR AND BRANDERHAM UNWILLING TO
REMAIN IDLE POURED FORTH HIS ZEAL IN A SHOWER OF LOUD TAPS ON THE BOARDS
OF THE PULPIT WHICH RESPONDED SO SMARTLY THAT AT LAST TO MY
UNSPEAKABLE RELIEF THEY WOKE ME
AND WHAT WAS IT THAT HAD SUGGESTED THE
TREMENDOUS TUMULT WHAT HAD PLAYED JABEZ'S PART IN THE ROW MERELY THE
BRANCH OF A FIR TREE THAT TOUCHED MY LATTICE AS THE BLAST WAILED BY AND
RATTLED ITS DRY CONES AGAINST THE PANES I LISTENED DOUBTINGLY AN
INSTANT DETECTED THE DISTURBER THEN TURNED AND DOZED AND DREAMT AGAIN
IF POSSIBLE STILL MORE DISAGREEABLY THAN BEFORE
THIS TIME I REMEMBERED I WAS LYING IN THE OAK CLOSET AND I HEARD
DISTINCTLY THE GUSTY WIND AND THE DRIVING OF THE SNOW I HEARD ALSO
THE FIR BOUGH REPEAT ITS TEASING SOUND AND ASCRIBED IT TO THE RIGHT
CAUSE BUT IT ANNOYED ME SO MUCH THAT I RESOLVED TO SILENCE IT IF
POSSIBLE AND I THOUGHT I ROSE AND ENDEAVOURED TO UNHASP THE CASEMENT
THE HOOK WAS SOLDERED INTO THE STAPLE A CIRCUMSTANCE OBSERVED BY ME WHEN
AWAKE BUT FORGOTTEN
'I MUST STOP IT NEVERTHELESS I MUTTERED
KNOCKING MY KNUCKLES THROUGH THE GLASS AND STRETCHING AN ARM OUT TO
SEIZE THE IMPORTUNATE BRANCH INSTEAD OF WHICH MY FINGERS CLOSED ON THE
FINGERS OF A LITTLE ICE COLD HAND THE INTENSE HORROR OF NIGHTMARE CAME
OVER ME I TRIED TO DRAW BACK MY ARM BUT THE HAND CLUNG TO IT AND A
MOST MELANCHOLY VOICE SOBBED 'LET ME IN LET ME IN 'WHO ARE YOU I
ASKED STRUGGLING MEANWHILE TO DISENGAGE MYSELF
'CATHERINE LINTON
IT REPLIED SHIVERINGLY WHY DID I THINK OF LINTON I HAD READ
EARNSHAW TWENTY TIMES FOR LINTON 'I'M COME HOME I'D LOST MY WAY ON
THE MOOR AS IT SPOKE I DISCERNED OBSCURELY A CHILD'S FACE LOOKING
THROUGH THE WINDOW
TERROR MADE ME CRUEL AND FINDING IT USELESS TO
ATTEMPT SHAKING THE CREATURE OFF I PULLED ITS WRIST ON TO THE BROKEN
PANE AND RUBBED IT TO AND FRO TILL THE BLOOD RAN DOWN AND SOAKED THE
BEDCLOTHES STILL IT WAILED 'LET ME IN AND MAINTAINED ITS TENACIOUS
GRIPE ALMOST MADDENING ME WITH FEAR
'HOW CAN I I SAID AT LENGTH
'LET ME GO IF YOU WANT ME TO LET YOU IN THE FINGERS RELAXED I
SNATCHED MINE THROUGH THE HOLE HURRIEDLY PILED THE BOOKS UP IN A PYRAMID
AGAINST IT AND STOPPED MY EARS TO EXCLUDE THE LAMENTABLE PRAYER
I
SEEMED TO KEEP THEM CLOSED ABOVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR YET THE INSTANT I
LISTENED AGAIN THERE WAS THE DOLEFUL CRY MOANING ON 'BEGONE I
SHOUTED
'I'LL NEVER LET YOU IN NOT IF YOU BEG FOR TWENTY YEARS 'IT
IS TWENTY YEARS MOURNED THE VOICE 'TWENTY YEARS
I'VE BEEN A WAIF FOR
TWENTY YEARS THEREAT BEGAN A FEEBLE SCRATCHING OUTSIDE AND THE PILE
OF BOOKS MOVED AS IF THRUST FORWARD
I TRIED TO JUMP UP BUT COULD NOT
STIR A LIMB AND SO YELLED ALOUD IN A FRENZY OF FRIGHT
TO MY
CONFUSION I DISCOVERED THE YELL WAS NOT IDEAL HASTY FOOTSTEPS
APPROACHED MY CHAMBER DOOR SOMEBODY PUSHED IT OPEN WITH A VIGOROUS
HAND AND A LIGHT GLIMMERED THROUGH THE SQUARES AT THE TOP OF THE BED
I
SAT SHUDDERING YET AND WIPING THE PERSPIRATION FROM MY FOREHEAD THE
INTRUDER APPEARED TO HESITATE AND MUTTERED TO HIMSELF
AT LAST HE
SAID IN A HALF WHISPER PLAINLY NOT EXPECTING AN ANSWER 'IS ANY ONE
HERE I CONSIDERED IT BEST TO CONFESS MY PRESENCE FOR I KNEW
HEATHCLIFF'S ACCENTS AND FEARED HE MIGHT SEARCH FURTHER IF I KEPT
QUIET
WITH THIS INTENTION I TURNED AND OPENED THE PANELS
I SHALL NOT
SOON FORGET THE EFFECT MY ACTION PRODUCED
HEATHCLIFF STOOD NEAR THE ENTRANCE IN HIS SHIRT AND TROUSERS WITH A
CANDLE DRIPPING OVER HIS FINGERS AND HIS FACE AS WHITE AS THE WALL
BEHIND HIM
THE FIRST CREAK OF THE OAK STARTLED HIM LIKE AN ELECTRIC
SHOCK THE LIGHT LEAPED FROM HIS HOLD TO A DISTANCE OF SOME FEET AND HIS
AGITATION WAS SO EXTREME THAT HE COULD HARDLY PICK IT UP
'IT IS ONLY YOUR GUEST SIR I CALLED OUT DESIROUS TO SPARE HIM THE
HUMILIATION OF EXPOSING HIS COWARDICE FURTHER
'I HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO
SCREAM IN MY SLEEP OWING TO A FRIGHTFUL NIGHTMARE
I'M SORRY I
DISTURBED YOU
'OH GOD CONFOUND YOU MR
LOCKWOOD I WISH YOU WERE AT THE COMMENCED
MY HOST SETTING THE CANDLE ON A CHAIR BECAUSE HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO
HOLD IT STEADY
'AND WHO SHOWED YOU UP INTO THIS ROOM HE CONTINUED
CRUSHING HIS NAILS INTO HIS PALMS AND GRINDING HIS TEETH TO SUBDUE THE
MAXILLARY CONVULSIONS
'WHO WAS IT I'VE A GOOD MIND TO TURN THEM OUT
OF THE HOUSE THIS MOMENT
'IT WAS YOUR SERVANT ZILLAH I REPLIED FLINGING MYSELF ON TO THE FLOOR
AND RAPIDLY RESUMING MY GARMENTS
'I SHOULD NOT CARE IF YOU DID MR
HEATHCLIFF SHE RICHLY DESERVES IT
I SUPPOSE THAT SHE WANTED TO GET
ANOTHER PROOF THAT THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED AT MY EXPENSE
WELL IT
IS SWARMING WITH GHOSTS AND GOBLINS YOU HAVE REASON IN SHUTTING IT UP
I ASSURE YOU
NO ONE WILL THANK YOU FOR A DOZE IN SUCH A DEN
'WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED HEATHCLIFF 'AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING LIE DOWN
AND FINISH OUT THE NIGHT SINCE YOU ARE HERE BUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
DON'T REPEAT THAT HORRID NOISE NOTHING COULD EXCUSE IT UNLESS YOU WERE
HAVING YOUR THROAT CUT
'IF THE LITTLE FIEND HAD GOT IN AT THE WINDOW SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
STRANGLED ME I RETURNED
'I'M NOT GOING TO ENDURE THE PERSECUTIONS OF
YOUR HOSPITABLE ANCESTORS AGAIN
WAS NOT THE REVEREND JABEZ BRANDERHAM
AKIN TO YOU ON THE MOTHER'S SIDE AND THAT MINX CATHERINE LINTON OR
EARNSHAW OR HOWEVER SHE WAS CALLED SHE MUST HAVE BEEN A
CHANGELING WICKED LITTLE SOUL SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD BEEN WALKING THE
EARTH THESE TWENTY YEARS A JUST PUNISHMENT FOR HER MORTAL
TRANSGRESSIONS I'VE NO DOUBT
SCARCELY WERE THESE WORDS UTTERED WHEN I RECOLLECTED THE ASSOCIATION OF
HEATHCLIFF'S WITH CATHERINE'S NAME IN THE BOOK WHICH HAD COMPLETELY
SLIPPED FROM MY MEMORY TILL THUS AWAKENED
I BLUSHED AT MY
INCONSIDERATION BUT WITHOUT SHOWING FURTHER CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE
OFFENCE I HASTENED TO ADD 'THE TRUTH IS SIR I PASSED THE FIRST PART
OF THE NIGHT IN HERE I STOPPED AFRESH I WAS ABOUT TO SAY 'PERUSING
THOSE OLD VOLUMES THEN IT WOULD HAVE REVEALED MY KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR
WRITTEN AS WELL AS THEIR PRINTED CONTENTS SO CORRECTING MYSELF I
WENT ON 'IN SPELLING OVER THE NAME SCRATCHED ON THAT WINDOW LEDGE
A
MONOTONOUS OCCUPATION CALCULATED TO SET ME ASLEEP LIKE COUNTING OR
'WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY TALKING IN THIS WAY TO ME THUNDERED
HEATHCLIFF WITH SAVAGE VEHEMENCE
'HOW HOW DARE YOU UNDER MY
ROOF GOD HE'S MAD TO SPEAK SO AND HE STRUCK HIS FOREHEAD WITH RAGE
I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO RESENT THIS LANGUAGE OR PURSUE MY EXPLANATION
BUT HE SEEMED SO POWERFULLY AFFECTED THAT I TOOK PITY AND PROCEEDED WITH
MY DREAMS AFFIRMING I HAD NEVER HEARD THE APPELLATION OF 'CATHERINE
LINTON' BEFORE BUT READING IT OFTEN OVER PRODUCED AN IMPRESSION WHICH
PERSONIFIED ITSELF WHEN I HAD NO LONGER MY IMAGINATION UNDER CONTROL
HEATHCLIFF GRADUALLY FELL BACK INTO THE SHELTER OF THE BED AS I SPOKE
FINALLY SITTING DOWN ALMOST CONCEALED BEHIND IT
I GUESSED HOWEVER BY
HIS IRREGULAR AND INTERCEPTED BREATHING THAT HE STRUGGLED TO VANQUISH AN
EXCESS OF VIOLENT EMOTION
NOT LIKING TO SHOW HIM THAT I HAD HEARD THE
CONFLICT I CONTINUED MY TOILETTE RATHER NOISILY LOOKED AT MY WATCH AND
SOLILOQUISED ON THE LENGTH OF THE NIGHT 'NOT THREE O'CLOCK YET I COULD
HAVE TAKEN OATH IT HAD BEEN SIX
TIME STAGNATES HERE WE MUST SURELY
HAVE RETIRED TO REST AT EIGHT
'ALWAYS AT NINE IN WINTER AND RISE AT FOUR SAID MY HOST SUPPRESSING A
GROAN AND AS I FANCIED BY THE MOTION OF HIS ARM'S SHADOW DASHING A
TEAR FROM HIS EYES
'MR
LOCKWOOD HE ADDED 'YOU MAY GO INTO MY ROOM
YOU'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY COMING DOWN STAIRS SO EARLY AND YOUR CHILDISH
OUTCRY HAS SENT SLEEP TO THE DEVIL FOR ME
'AND FOR ME TOO I REPLIED
'I'LL WALK IN THE YARD TILL DAYLIGHT AND
THEN I'LL BE OFF AND YOU NEED NOT DREAD A REPETITION OF MY INTRUSION
I'M NOW QUITE CURED OF SEEKING PLEASURE IN SOCIETY BE IT COUNTRY OR
TOWN
A SENSIBLE MAN OUGHT TO FIND SUFFICIENT COMPANY IN HIMSELF
'DELIGHTFUL COMPANY MUTTERED HEATHCLIFF
'TAKE THE CANDLE AND GO
WHERE YOU PLEASE
I SHALL JOIN YOU DIRECTLY
KEEP OUT OF THE YARD
THOUGH THE DOGS ARE UNCHAINED AND THE HOUSE JUNO MOUNTS SENTINEL
THERE AND NAY YOU CAN ONLY RAMBLE ABOUT THE STEPS AND PASSAGES
BUT
AWAY WITH YOU I'LL COME IN TWO MINUTES
I OBEYED SO FAR AS TO QUIT THE CHAMBER WHEN IGNORANT WHERE THE NARROW
LOBBIES LED I STOOD STILL AND WAS WITNESS INVOLUNTARILY TO A PIECE OF
SUPERSTITION ON THE PART OF MY LANDLORD WHICH BELIED ODDLY HIS APPARENT
SENSE
HE GOT ON TO THE BED AND WRENCHED OPEN THE LATTICE BURSTING AS
HE PULLED AT IT INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE PASSION OF TEARS
'COME IN COME
IN HE SOBBED
'CATHY DO COME
OH DO ONCE MORE OH MY HEART'S
DARLING HEAR ME THIS TIME CATHERINE AT LAST THE SPECTRE SHOWED A
SPECTRE'S ORDINARY CAPRICE IT GAVE NO SIGN OF BEING BUT THE SNOW AND
WIND WHIRLED WILDLY THROUGH EVEN REACHING MY STATION AND BLOWING OUT
THE LIGHT
THERE WAS SUCH ANGUISH IN THE GUSH OF GRIEF THAT ACCOMPANIED THIS RAVING
THAT MY COMPASSION MADE ME OVERLOOK ITS FOLLY AND I DREW OFF HALF ANGRY
TO HAVE LISTENED AT ALL AND VEXED AT HAVING RELATED MY RIDICULOUS
NIGHTMARE SINCE IT PRODUCED THAT AGONY THOUGH WHY WAS BEYOND MY
COMPREHENSION
I DESCENDED CAUTIOUSLY TO THE LOWER REGIONS AND LANDED
IN THE BACK KITCHEN WHERE A GLEAM OF FIRE RAKED COMPACTLY TOGETHER
ENABLED ME TO REKINDLE MY CANDLE
NOTHING WAS STIRRING EXCEPT A
BRINDLED GREY CAT WHICH CREPT FROM THE ASHES AND SALUTED ME WITH A
QUERULOUS MEW
TWO BENCHES SHAPED IN SECTIONS OF A CIRCLE NEARLY ENCLOSED THE HEARTH
ON ONE OF THESE I STRETCHED MYSELF AND GRIMALKIN MOUNTED THE OTHER
WE
WERE BOTH OF US NODDING ERE ANY ONE INVADED OUR RETREAT AND THEN IT WAS
JOSEPH SHUFFLING DOWN A WOODEN LADDER THAT VANISHED IN THE ROOF THROUGH
A TRAP THE ASCENT TO HIS GARRET I SUPPOSE
HE CAST A SINISTER LOOK AT
THE LITTLE FLAME WHICH I HAD ENTICED TO PLAY BETWEEN THE RIBS SWEPT THE
CAT FROM ITS ELEVATION AND BESTOWING HIMSELF IN THE VACANCY COMMENCED
THE OPERATION OF STUFFING A THREE INCH PIPE WITH TOBACCO
MY PRESENCE IN
HIS SANCTUM WAS EVIDENTLY ESTEEMED A PIECE OF IMPUDENCE TOO SHAMEFUL FOR
REMARK HE SILENTLY APPLIED THE TUBE TO HIS LIPS FOLDED HIS ARMS AND
PUFFED AWAY
I LET HIM ENJOY THE LUXURY UNANNOYED AND AFTER SUCKING OUT
HIS LAST WREATH AND HEAVING A PROFOUND SIGH HE GOT UP AND DEPARTED AS
SOLEMNLY AS HE CAME
A MORE ELASTIC FOOTSTEP ENTERED NEXT AND NOW I OPENED MY MOUTH FOR A
'GOOD MORNING BUT CLOSED IT AGAIN THE SALUTATION UNACHIEVED FOR
HARETON EARNSHAW WAS PERFORMING HIS ORISON SOTTO VOCE IN A SERIES OF
CURSES DIRECTED AGAINST EVERY OBJECT HE TOUCHED WHILE HE RUMMAGED A
CORNER FOR A SPADE OR SHOVEL TO DIG THROUGH THE DRIFTS
HE GLANCED OVER
THE BACK OF THE BENCH DILATING HIS NOSTRILS AND THOUGHT AS LITTLE OF
EXCHANGING CIVILITIES WITH ME AS WITH MY COMPANION THE CAT
I GUESSED
BY HIS PREPARATIONS THAT EGRESS WAS ALLOWED AND LEAVING MY HARD COUCH
MADE A MOVEMENT TO FOLLOW HIM
HE NOTICED THIS AND THRUST AT AN INNER
DOOR WITH THE END OF HIS SPADE INTIMATING BY AN INARTICULATE SOUND THAT
THERE WAS THE PLACE WHERE I MUST GO IF I CHANGED MY LOCALITY
IT OPENED INTO THE HOUSE WHERE THE FEMALES WERE ALREADY ASTIR ZILLAH
URGING FLAKES OF FLAME UP THE CHIMNEY WITH A COLOSSAL BELLOWS AND MRS
HEATHCLIFF KNEELING ON THE HEARTH READING A BOOK BY THE AID OF THE
BLAZE
SHE HELD HER HAND INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE FURNACE HEAT AND HER
EYES AND SEEMED ABSORBED IN HER OCCUPATION DESISTING FROM IT ONLY TO
CHIDE THE SERVANT FOR COVERING HER WITH SPARKS OR TO PUSH AWAY A DOG
NOW AND THEN THAT SNOOZLED ITS NOSE OVERFORWARDLY INTO HER FACE
I WAS
SURPRISED TO SEE HEATHCLIFF THERE ALSO
HE STOOD BY THE FIRE HIS BACK
TOWARDS ME JUST FINISHING A STORMY SCENE WITH POOR ZILLAH WHO EVER AND
ANON INTERRUPTED HER LABOUR TO PLUCK UP THE CORNER OF HER APRON AND
HEAVE AN INDIGNANT GROAN
'AND YOU YOU WORTHLESS HE BROKE OUT AS I ENTERED TURNING TO HIS
DAUGHTER IN LAW AND EMPLOYING AN EPITHET AS HARMLESS AS DUCK OR SHEEP

THE YOUNG LADY CLOSING HER BOOK AND THROWING IT ON A CHAIR
'BUT I'LL
NOT DO ANYTHING THOUGH YOU SHOULD SWEAR YOUR TONGUE OUT EXCEPT WHAT I

HEATHCLIFF LIFTED HIS HAND AND THE SPEAKER SPRANG TO A SAFER DISTANCE
OBVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH ITS WEIGHT
HAVING NO DESIRE TO BE ENTERTAINED
BY A CAT AND DOG COMBAT I STEPPED FORWARD BRISKLY AS IF EAGER TO
PARTAKE THE WARMTH OF THE HEARTH AND INNOCENT OF ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE
INTERRUPTED DISPUTE
EACH HAD ENOUGH DECORUM TO SUSPEND FURTHER
HOSTILITIES HEATHCLIFF PLACED HIS FISTS OUT OF TEMPTATION IN HIS
POCKETS MRS
HEATHCLIFF CURLED HER LIP AND WALKED TO A SEAT FAR OFF
WHERE SHE KEPT HER WORD BY PLAYING THE PART OF A STATUE DURING THE
REMAINDER OF MY STAY
THAT WAS NOT LONG
I DECLINED JOINING THEIR
BREAKFAST AND AT THE FIRST GLEAM OF DAWN TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF
ESCAPING INTO THE FREE AIR NOW CLEAR AND STILL AND COLD AS IMPALPABLE
ICE
MY LANDLORD HALLOED FOR ME TO STOP ERE I REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE
GARDEN AND OFFERED TO ACCOMPANY ME ACROSS THE MOOR
IT WAS WELL HE DID
FOR THE WHOLE HILL BACK WAS ONE BILLOWY WHITE OCEAN THE SWELLS AND
FALLS NOT INDICATING CORRESPONDING RISES AND DEPRESSIONS IN THE GROUND
MANY PITS AT LEAST WERE FILLED TO A LEVEL AND ENTIRE RANGES OF MOUNDS
THE REFUSE OF THE QUARRIES BLOTTED FROM THE CHART WHICH MY YESTERDAY'S
WALK LEFT PICTURED IN MY MIND
I HAD REMARKED ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD
AT INTERVALS OF SIX OR SEVEN YARDS A LINE OF UPRIGHT STONES CONTINUED
THROUGH THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BARREN THESE WERE ERECTED AND DAUBED
WITH LIME ON PURPOSE TO SERVE AS GUIDES IN THE DARK AND ALSO WHEN A
FALL LIKE THE PRESENT CONFOUNDED THE DEEP SWAMPS ON EITHER HAND WITH
THE FIRMER PATH BUT EXCEPTING A DIRTY DOT POINTING UP HERE AND THERE
ALL TRACES OF THEIR EXISTENCE HAD VANISHED AND MY COMPANION FOUND IT
NECESSARY TO WARN ME FREQUENTLY TO STEER TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT WHEN I
IMAGINED I WAS FOLLOWING CORRECTLY THE WINDINGS OF THE ROAD
WE EXCHANGED LITTLE CONVERSATION AND HE HALTED AT THE ENTRANCE OF
THRUSHCROSS PARK SAYING I COULD MAKE NO ERROR THERE
OUR ADIEUX WERE
LIMITED TO A HASTY BOW AND THEN I PUSHED FORWARD TRUSTING TO MY OWN
RESOURCES FOR THE PORTER'S LODGE IS UNTENANTED AS YET
THE DISTANCE
FROM THE GATE TO THE GRANGE IS TWO MILES I BELIEVE I MANAGED TO MAKE IT
FOUR WHAT WITH LOSING MYSELF AMONG THE TREES AND SINKING UP TO THE NECK
IN SNOW A PREDICAMENT WHICH ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED IT CAN
APPRECIATE
AT ANY RATE WHATEVER WERE MY WANDERINGS THE CLOCK CHIMED
TWELVE AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THAT GAVE EXACTLY AN HOUR FOR EVERY
MILE OF THE USUAL WAY FROM WUTHERING HEIGHTS
MY HUMAN FIXTURE AND HER SATELLITES RUSHED TO WELCOME ME EXCLAIMING
TUMULTUOUSLY THEY HAD COMPLETELY GIVEN ME UP EVERYBODY CONJECTURED THAT
I PERISHED LAST NIGHT AND THEY WERE WONDERING HOW THEY MUST SET ABOUT
THE SEARCH FOR MY REMAINS
I BID THEM BE QUIET NOW THAT THEY SAW ME
RETURNED AND BENUMBED TO MY VERY HEART I DRAGGED UP STAIRS WHENCE
AFTER PUTTING ON DRY CLOTHES AND PACING TO AND FRO THIRTY OR FORTY
MINUTES TO RESTORE THE ANIMAL HEAT I ADJOURNED TO MY STUDY FEEBLE AS A
KITTEN ALMOST TOO MUCH SO TO ENJOY THE CHEERFUL FIRE AND SMOKING COFFEE
WHICH THE SERVANT HAD PREPARED FOR MY REFRESHMENT
CHAPTER IV
WHAT VAIN WEATHERCOCKS WE ARE I WHO HAD DETERMINED TO HOLD MYSELF
INDEPENDENT OF ALL SOCIAL INTERCOURSE AND THANKED MY STARS THAT AT
LENGTH I HAD LIGHTED ON A SPOT WHERE IT WAS NEXT TO IMPRACTICABLE I
WEAK WRETCH AFTER MAINTAINING TILL DUSK A STRUGGLE WITH LOW SPIRITS AND
SOLITUDE WAS FINALLY COMPELLED TO STRIKE MY COLOURS AND UNDER PRETENCE
OF GAINING INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NECESSITIES OF MY ESTABLISHMENT I
DESIRED MRS
DEAN WHEN SHE BROUGHT IN SUPPER TO SIT DOWN WHILE I ATE
IT HOPING SINCERELY SHE WOULD PROVE A REGULAR GOSSIP AND EITHER ROUSE
ME TO ANIMATION OR LULL ME TO SLEEP BY HER TALK
'YOU HAVE LIVED HERE A CONSIDERABLE TIME I COMMENCED 'DID YOU NOT SAY
SIXTEEN YEARS
'EIGHTEEN SIR I CAME WHEN THE MISTRESS WAS MARRIED TO WAIT ON HER
AFTER SHE DIED THE MASTER RETAINED ME FOR HIS HOUSEKEEPER
'INDEED
THERE ENSUED A PAUSE
SHE WAS NOT A GOSSIP I FEARED UNLESS ABOUT HER
OWN AFFAIRS AND THOSE COULD HARDLY INTEREST ME
HOWEVER HAVING STUDIED
FOR AN INTERVAL WITH A FIST ON EITHER KNEE AND A CLOUD OF MEDITATION
OVER HER RUDDY COUNTENANCE SHE EJACULATED 'AH TIMES ARE GREATLY
CHANGED SINCE THEN
'YES I REMARKED 'YOU'VE SEEN A GOOD MANY ALTERATIONS I SUPPOSE
'I HAVE AND TROUBLES TOO SHE SAID
'OH I'LL TURN THE TALK ON MY LANDLORD'S FAMILY I THOUGHT TO MYSELF
'A
GOOD SUBJECT TO START AND THAT PRETTY GIRL WIDOW I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW
HER HISTORY WHETHER SHE BE A NATIVE OF THE COUNTRY OR AS IS MORE
PROBABLE AN EXOTIC THAT THE SURLY INDIGENAE WILL NOT RECOGNISE FOR
KIN WITH THIS INTENTION I ASKED MRS
DEAN WHY HEATHCLIFF LET
THRUSHCROSS GRANGE AND PREFERRED LIVING IN A SITUATION AND RESIDENCE SO
MUCH INFERIOR
'IS HE NOT RICH ENOUGH TO KEEP THE ESTATE IN GOOD ORDER
I INQUIRED
'RICH SIR SHE RETURNED
'HE HAS NOBODY KNOWS WHAT MONEY AND EVERY
YEAR IT INCREASES
YES YES HE'S RICH ENOUGH TO LIVE IN A FINER HOUSE
THAN THIS BUT HE'S VERY NEAR CLOSE HANDED AND IF HE HAD MEANT TO FLIT
TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE AS SOON AS HE HEARD OF A GOOD TENANT HE COULD NOT
HAVE BORNE TO MISS THE CHANCE OF GETTING A FEW HUNDREDS MORE
IT IS
STRANGE PEOPLE SHOULD BE SO GREEDY WHEN THEY ARE ALONE IN THE WORLD
'HE HAD A SON IT SEEMS
'YES HE HAD ONE HE IS DEAD
'AND THAT YOUNG LADY MRS
HEATHCLIFF IS HIS WIDOW
'YES
'WHERE DID SHE COME FROM ORIGINALLY
'WHY SIR SHE IS MY LATE MASTER'S DAUGHTER CATHERINE LINTON WAS HER
MAIDEN NAME
I NURSED HER POOR THING I DID WISH MR
HEATHCLIFF WOULD
REMOVE HERE AND THEN WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOGETHER AGAIN
'WHAT CATHERINE LINTON I EXCLAIMED ASTONISHED
BUT A MINUTE'S
REFLECTION CONVINCED ME IT WAS NOT MY GHOSTLY CATHERINE
'THEN I
CONTINUED 'MY PREDECESSOR'S NAME WAS LINTON
'IT WAS
'AND WHO IS THAT EARNSHAW HARETON EARNSHAW WHO LIVES WITH MR
HEATHCLIFF ARE THEY RELATIONS
'NO HE IS THE LATE MRS
LINTON'S NEPHEW
'THE YOUNG LADY'S COUSIN THEN
'YES AND HER HUSBAND WAS HER COUSIN ALSO ONE ON THE MOTHER'S THE OTHER
ON THE FATHER'S SIDE HEATHCLIFF MARRIED MR
LINTON'S SISTER
'I SEE THE HOUSE AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS HAS EARNSHAW CARVED OVER THE
FRONT DOOR
ARE THEY AN OLD FAMILY
'VERY OLD SIR AND HARETON IS THE LAST OF THEM AS OUR MISS CATHY IS OF
US I MEAN OF THE LINTONS
HAVE YOU BEEN TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS I BEG
PARDON FOR ASKING BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR HOW SHE IS
'MRS
HEATHCLIFF SHE LOOKED VERY WELL AND VERY HANDSOME YET I THINK
NOT VERY HAPPY
'OH DEAR I DON'T WONDER AND HOW DID YOU LIKE THE MASTER
'A ROUGH FELLOW RATHER MRS
DEAN
IS NOT THAT HIS CHARACTER
'ROUGH AS A SAW EDGE AND HARD AS WHINSTONE THE LESS YOU MEDDLE WITH
HIM THE BETTER
'HE MUST HAVE HAD SOME UPS AND DOWNS IN LIFE TO MAKE HIM SUCH A CHURL
DO
YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIS HISTORY
'IT'S A CUCKOO'S SIR I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT EXCEPT WHERE HE WAS BORN AND
WHO WERE HIS PARENTS AND HOW HE GOT HIS MONEY AT FIRST
AND HARETON HAS
BEEN CAST OUT LIKE AN UNFLEDGED DUNNOCK THE UNFORTUNATE LAD IS THE ONLY
ONE IN ALL THIS PARISH THAT DOES NOT GUESS HOW HE HAS BEEN CHEATED
'WELL MRS
DEAN IT WILL BE A CHARITABLE DEED TO TELL ME SOMETHING OF MY
NEIGHBOURS I FEEL I SHALL NOT REST IF I GO TO BED SO BE GOOD ENOUGH TO
SIT AND CHAT AN HOUR
'OH CERTAINLY SIR I'LL JUST FETCH A LITTLE SEWING AND THEN I'LL SIT
AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE
BUT YOU'VE CAUGHT COLD I SAW YOU SHIVERING AND
YOU MUST HAVE SOME GRUEL TO DRIVE IT OUT
THE WORTHY WOMAN BUSTLED OFF AND I CROUCHED NEARER THE FIRE MY HEAD
FELT HOT AND THE REST OF ME CHILL MOREOVER I WAS EXCITED ALMOST TO A
PITCH OF FOOLISHNESS THROUGH MY NERVES AND BRAIN
THIS CAUSED ME TO
FEEL NOT UNCOMFORTABLE BUT RATHER FEARFUL AS I AM STILL OF SERIOUS
EFFECTS FROM THE INCIDENTS OF TO DAY AND YESTERDAY
SHE RETURNED
PRESENTLY BRINGING A SMOKING BASIN AND A BASKET OF WORK AND HAVING
PLACED THE FORMER ON THE HOB DREW IN HER SEAT EVIDENTLY PLEASED TO FIND
ME SO COMPANIONABLE
BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE HERE SHE COMMENCED WAITING NO FARTHER INVITATION
TO HER STORY I WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS BECAUSE MY MOTHER
HAD NURSED MR
HINDLEY EARNSHAW THAT WAS HARETON'S FATHER AND I GOT
USED TO PLAYING WITH THE CHILDREN I RAN ERRANDS TOO AND HELPED TO MAKE
HAY AND HUNG ABOUT THE FARM READY FOR ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY WOULD SET ME
TO
ONE FINE SUMMER MORNING IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF HARVEST I
REMEMBER MR
EARNSHAW THE OLD MASTER CAME DOWN STAIRS DRESSED FOR A
JOURNEY AND AFTER HE HAD TOLD JOSEPH WHAT WAS TO BE DONE DURING THE
DAY HE TURNED TO HINDLEY AND CATHY AND ME FOR I SAT EATING MY
PORRIDGE WITH THEM AND HE SAID SPEAKING TO HIS SON 'NOW MY BONNY MAN
I'M GOING TO LIVERPOOL TO DAY WHAT SHALL I BRING YOU YOU MAY CHOOSE
WHAT YOU LIKE ONLY LET IT BE LITTLE FOR I SHALL WALK THERE AND BACK
SIXTY MILES EACH WAY THAT IS A LONG SPELL HINDLEY NAMED A FIDDLE AND
THEN HE ASKED MISS CATHY SHE WAS HARDLY SIX YEARS OLD BUT SHE COULD
RIDE ANY HORSE IN THE STABLE AND SHE CHOSE A WHIP
HE DID NOT FORGET
ME FOR HE HAD A KIND HEART THOUGH HE WAS RATHER SEVERE SOMETIMES
HE
PROMISED TO BRING ME A POCKETFUL OF APPLES AND PEARS AND THEN HE KISSED
HIS CHILDREN SAID GOOD BYE AND SET OFF
IT SEEMED A LONG WHILE TO US ALL THE THREE DAYS OF HIS ABSENCE AND
OFTEN DID LITTLE CATHY ASK WHEN HE WOULD BE HOME
MRS
EARNSHAW EXPECTED
HIM BY SUPPER TIME ON THE THIRD EVENING AND SHE PUT THE MEAL OFF HOUR
AFTER HOUR THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HIS COMING HOWEVER AND AT LAST THE
CHILDREN GOT TIRED OF RUNNING DOWN TO THE GATE TO LOOK
THEN IT GREW
DARK SHE WOULD HAVE HAD THEM TO BED BUT THEY BEGGED SADLY TO BE ALLOWED
TO STAY UP AND JUST ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE DOOR LATCH WAS RAISED
QUIETLY AND IN STEPPED THE MASTER
HE THREW HIMSELF INTO A CHAIR
LAUGHING AND GROANING AND BID THEM ALL STAND OFF FOR HE WAS NEARLY
KILLED HE WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH ANOTHER WALK FOR THE THREE KINGDOMS
'AND AT THE END OF IT TO BE FLIGHTED TO DEATH HE SAID OPENING HIS
GREAT COAT WHICH HE HELD BUNDLED UP IN HIS ARMS
'SEE HERE WIFE I
WAS NEVER SO BEATEN WITH ANYTHING IN MY LIFE BUT YOU MUST E'EN TAKE IT
AS A GIFT OF GOD THOUGH IT'S AS DARK ALMOST AS IF IT CAME FROM THE
DEVIL
WE CROWDED ROUND AND OVER MISS CATHY'S HEAD I HAD A PEEP AT A DIRTY
RAGGED BLACK HAIRED CHILD BIG ENOUGH BOTH TO WALK AND TALK INDEED ITS
FACE LOOKED OLDER THAN CATHERINE'S YET WHEN IT WAS SET ON ITS FEET IT
ONLY STARED ROUND AND REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN SOME GIBBERISH THAT
NOBODY COULD UNDERSTAND
I WAS FRIGHTENED AND MRS
EARNSHAW WAS READY
TO FLING IT OUT OF DOORS SHE DID FLY UP ASKING HOW HE COULD FASHION TO
BRING THAT GIPSY BRAT INTO THE HOUSE WHEN THEY HAD THEIR OWN BAIRNS TO
FEED AND FEND FOR WHAT HE MEANT TO DO WITH IT AND WHETHER HE WERE MAD
THE MASTER TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE MATTER BUT HE WAS REALLY HALF DEAD WITH
FATIGUE AND ALL THAT I COULD MAKE OUT AMONGST HER SCOLDING WAS A TALE
OF HIS SEEING IT STARVING AND HOUSELESS AND AS GOOD AS DUMB IN THE
STREETS OF LIVERPOOL WHERE HE PICKED IT UP AND INQUIRED FOR ITS OWNER
NOT A SOUL KNEW TO WHOM IT BELONGED HE SAID AND HIS MONEY AND TIME
BEING BOTH LIMITED HE THOUGHT IT BETTER TO TAKE IT HOME WITH HIM AT
ONCE THAN RUN INTO VAIN EXPENSES THERE BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED HE
WOULD NOT LEAVE IT AS HE FOUND IT
WELL THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT MY
MISTRESS GRUMBLED HERSELF CALM AND MR
EARNSHAW TOLD ME TO WASH IT AND
GIVE IT CLEAN THINGS AND LET IT SLEEP WITH THE CHILDREN
HINDLEY AND CATHY CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH LOOKING AND LISTENING TILL
PEACE WAS RESTORED THEN BOTH BEGAN SEARCHING THEIR FATHER'S POCKETS
FOR THE PRESENTS HE HAD PROMISED THEM
THE FORMER WAS A BOY OF FOURTEEN
BUT WHEN HE DREW OUT WHAT HAD BEEN A FIDDLE CRUSHED TO MORSELS IN THE
GREAT COAT HE BLUBBERED ALOUD AND CATHY WHEN SHE LEARNED THE MASTER
HAD LOST HER WHIP IN ATTENDING ON THE STRANGER SHOWED HER HUMOUR BY
GRINNING AND SPITTING AT THE STUPID LITTLE THING EARNING FOR HER PAINS
A SOUND BLOW FROM HER FATHER TO TEACH HER CLEANER MANNERS
THEY
ENTIRELY REFUSED TO HAVE IT IN BED WITH THEM OR EVEN IN THEIR ROOM AND
I HAD NO MORE SENSE SO I PUT IT ON THE LANDING OF THE STAIRS HOPING IT
MIGHT BE GONE ON THE MORROW
BY CHANCE OR ELSE ATTRACTED BY HEARING HIS
VOICE IT CREPT TO MR
EARNSHAW'S DOOR AND THERE HE FOUND IT ON
QUITTING HIS CHAMBER
INQUIRIES WERE MADE AS TO HOW IT GOT THERE I WAS
OBLIGED TO CONFESS AND IN RECOMPENSE FOR MY COWARDICE AND INHUMANITY
WAS SENT OUT OF THE HOUSE
THIS WAS HEATHCLIFF'S FIRST INTRODUCTION TO THE FAMILY
ON COMING BACK A
FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS FOR I DID NOT CONSIDER MY BANISHMENT PERPETUAL I
FOUND THEY HAD CHRISTENED HIM 'HEATHCLIFF' IT WAS THE NAME OF A SON WHO
DIED IN CHILDHOOD AND IT HAS SERVED HIM EVER SINCE BOTH FOR CHRISTIAN
AND SURNAME
MISS CATHY AND HE WERE NOW VERY THICK BUT HINDLEY HATED
HIM AND TO SAY THE TRUTH I DID THE SAME AND WE PLAGUED AND WENT ON WITH
HIM SHAMEFULLY FOR I WASN'T REASONABLE ENOUGH TO FEEL MY INJUSTICE AND
THE MISTRESS NEVER PUT IN A WORD ON HIS BEHALF WHEN SHE SAW HIM WRONGED
HE SEEMED A SULLEN PATIENT CHILD HARDENED PERHAPS TO ILL TREATMENT
HE WOULD STAND HINDLEY'S BLOWS WITHOUT WINKING OR SHEDDING A TEAR AND MY
PINCHES MOVED HIM ONLY TO DRAW IN A BREATH AND OPEN HIS EYES AS IF HE
HAD HURT HIMSELF BY ACCIDENT AND NOBODY WAS TO BLAME
THIS ENDURANCE
MADE OLD EARNSHAW FURIOUS WHEN HE DISCOVERED HIS SON PERSECUTING THE
POOR FATHERLESS CHILD AS HE CALLED HIM
HE TOOK TO HEATHCLIFF
STRANGELY BELIEVING ALL HE SAID FOR THAT MATTER HE SAID PRECIOUS
LITTLE AND GENERALLY THE TRUTH AND PETTING HIM UP FAR ABOVE CATHY WHO
WAS TOO MISCHIEVOUS AND WAYWARD FOR A FAVOURITE
SO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING HE BRED BAD FEELING IN THE HOUSE AND AT
MRS
EARNSHAW'S DEATH WHICH HAPPENED IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE
YOUNG MASTER HAD LEARNED TO REGARD HIS FATHER AS AN OPPRESSOR RATHER THAN
A FRIEND AND HEATHCLIFF AS A USURPER OF HIS PARENT'S AFFECTIONS AND HIS
PRIVILEGES AND HE GREW BITTER WITH BROODING OVER THESE INJURIES
I
SYMPATHISED A WHILE BUT WHEN THE CHILDREN FELL ILL OF THE MEASLES AND I
HAD TO TEND THEM AND TAKE ON ME THE CARES OF A WOMAN AT ONCE I CHANGED
MY IDEA
HEATHCLIFF WAS DANGEROUSLY SICK AND WHILE HE LAY AT THE WORST
HE WOULD HAVE ME CONSTANTLY BY HIS PILLOW I SUPPOSE HE FELT I DID A GOOD
DEAL FOR HIM AND HE HADN'T WIT TO GUESS THAT I WAS COMPELLED TO DO IT
HOWEVER I WILL SAY THIS HE WAS THE QUIETEST CHILD THAT EVER NURSE
WATCHED OVER
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND THE OTHERS FORCED ME TO BE
LESS PARTIAL
CATHY AND HER BROTHER HARASSED ME TERRIBLY HE WAS AS
UNCOMPLAINING AS A LAMB THOUGH HARDNESS NOT GENTLENESS MADE HIM GIVE
LITTLE TROUBLE
HE GOT THROUGH AND THE DOCTOR AFFIRMED IT WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE OWING
TO ME AND PRAISED ME FOR MY CARE
I WAS VAIN OF HIS COMMENDATIONS AND
SOFTENED TOWARDS THE BEING BY WHOSE MEANS I EARNED THEM AND THUS HINDLEY
LOST HIS LAST ALLY STILL I COULDN'T DOTE ON HEATHCLIFF AND I WONDERED
OFTEN WHAT MY MASTER SAW TO ADMIRE SO MUCH IN THE SULLEN BOY WHO NEVER
TO MY RECOLLECTION REPAID HIS INDULGENCE BY ANY SIGN OF GRATITUDE
HE
WAS NOT INSOLENT TO HIS BENEFACTOR HE WAS SIMPLY INSENSIBLE THOUGH
KNOWING PERFECTLY THE HOLD HE HAD ON HIS HEART AND CONSCIOUS HE HAD ONLY
TO SPEAK AND ALL THE HOUSE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO BEND TO HIS WISHES
AS AN
INSTANCE I REMEMBER MR
EARNSHAW ONCE BOUGHT A COUPLE OF COLTS AT THE
PARISH FAIR AND GAVE THE LADS EACH ONE
HEATHCLIFF TOOK THE HANDSOMEST
BUT IT SOON FELL LAME AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED IT HE SAID TO HINDLEY
'YOU MUST EXCHANGE HORSES WITH ME I DON'T LIKE MINE AND IF YOU WON'T I
SHALL TELL YOUR FATHER OF THE THREE THRASHINGS YOU'VE GIVEN ME THIS WEEK
AND SHOW HIM MY ARM WHICH IS BLACK TO THE SHOULDER HINDLEY PUT OUT
HIS TONGUE AND CUFFED HIM OVER THE EARS
'YOU'D BETTER DO IT AT ONCE
HE PERSISTED ESCAPING TO THE PORCH THEY WERE IN THE STABLE 'YOU WILL
HAVE TO AND IF I SPEAK OF THESE BLOWS YOU'LL GET THEM AGAIN WITH
INTEREST 'OFF DOG CRIED HINDLEY THREATENING HIM WITH AN IRON
WEIGHT USED FOR WEIGHING POTATOES AND HAY
'THROW IT HE REPLIED
STANDING STILL 'AND THEN I'LL TELL HOW YOU BOASTED THAT YOU WOULD TURN
ME OUT OF DOORS AS SOON AS HE DIED AND SEE WHETHER HE WILL NOT TURN YOU
OUT DIRECTLY HINDLEY THREW IT HITTING HIM ON THE BREAST AND DOWN HE
FELL BUT STAGGERED UP IMMEDIATELY BREATHLESS AND WHITE AND HAD NOT I
PREVENTED IT HE WOULD HAVE GONE JUST SO TO THE MASTER AND GOT FULL
REVENGE BY LETTING HIS CONDITION PLEAD FOR HIM INTIMATING WHO HAD CAUSED
IT
'TAKE MY COLT GIPSY THEN SAID YOUNG EARNSHAW
'AND I PRAY THAT
HE MAY BREAK YOUR NECK TAKE HIM AND BE DAMNED YOU BEGGARLY INTERLOPER
AND WHEEDLE MY FATHER OUT OF ALL HE HAS ONLY AFTERWARDS SHOW HIM WHAT
YOU ARE IMP OF SATAN AND TAKE THAT I HOPE HE'LL KICK OUT YOUR
BRAINS
HEATHCLIFF HAD GONE TO LOOSE THE BEAST AND SHIFT IT TO HIS OWN STALL HE
WAS PASSING BEHIND IT WHEN HINDLEY FINISHED HIS SPEECH BY KNOCKING HIM
UNDER ITS FEET AND WITHOUT STOPPING TO EXAMINE WHETHER HIS HOPES WERE
FULFILLED RAN AWAY AS FAST AS HE COULD
I WAS SURPRISED TO WITNESS HOW
COOLLY THE CHILD GATHERED HIMSELF UP AND WENT ON WITH HIS INTENTION
EXCHANGING SADDLES AND ALL AND THEN SITTING DOWN ON A BUNDLE OF HAY TO
OVERCOME THE QUALM WHICH THE VIOLENT BLOW OCCASIONED BEFORE HE ENTERED
THE HOUSE
I PERSUADED HIM EASILY TO LET ME LAY THE BLAME OF HIS BRUISES
ON THE HORSE HE MINDED LITTLE WHAT TALE WAS TOLD SINCE HE HAD WHAT HE
WANTED
HE COMPLAINED SO SELDOM INDEED OF SUCH STIRS AS THESE THAT I
REALLY THOUGHT HIM NOT VINDICTIVE I WAS DECEIVED COMPLETELY AS YOU WILL
HEAR
CHAPTER V
IN THE COURSE OF TIME MR
EARNSHAW BEGAN TO FAIL
HE HAD BEEN ACTIVE AND
HEALTHY YET HIS STRENGTH LEFT HIM SUDDENLY AND WHEN HE WAS CONFINED TO
THE CHIMNEY CORNER HE GREW GRIEVOUSLY IRRITABLE
A NOTHING VEXED HIM
AND SUSPECTED SLIGHTS OF HIS AUTHORITY NEARLY THREW HIM INTO FITS
THIS
WAS ESPECIALLY TO BE REMARKED IF ANY ONE ATTEMPTED TO IMPOSE UPON OR
DOMINEER OVER HIS FAVOURITE HE WAS PAINFULLY JEALOUS LEST A WORD
SHOULD BE SPOKEN AMISS TO HIM SEEMING TO HAVE GOT INTO HIS HEAD THE
NOTION THAT BECAUSE HE LIKED HEATHCLIFF ALL HATED AND LONGED TO DO
HIM AN ILL TURN
IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO THE LAD FOR THE KINDER AMONG
US DID NOT WISH TO FRET THE MASTER SO WE HUMOURED HIS PARTIALITY AND
THAT HUMOURING WAS RICH NOURISHMENT TO THE CHILD'S PRIDE AND BLACK
TEMPERS
STILL IT BECAME IN A MANNER NECESSARY TWICE OR THRICE
HINDLEY'S MANIFESTATION OF SCORN WHILE HIS FATHER WAS NEAR ROUSED THE
OLD MAN TO A FURY HE SEIZED HIS STICK TO STRIKE HIM AND SHOOK WITH
RAGE THAT HE COULD NOT DO IT
AT LAST OUR CURATE WE HAD A CURATE THEN WHO MADE THE LIVING ANSWER BY
TEACHING THE LITTLE LINTONS AND EARNSHAWS AND FARMING HIS BIT OF LAND
HIMSELF ADVISED THAT THE YOUNG MAN SHOULD BE SENT TO COLLEGE AND MR
EARNSHAW AGREED THOUGH WITH A HEAVY SPIRIT FOR HE SAID 'HINDLEY WAS
NOUGHT AND WOULD NEVER THRIVE AS WHERE HE WANDERED
I HOPED HEARTILY WE SHOULD HAVE PEACE NOW
IT HURT ME TO THINK THE
MASTER SHOULD BE MADE UNCOMFORTABLE BY HIS OWN GOOD DEED
I FANCIED THE
DISCONTENT OF AGE AND DISEASE AROSE FROM HIS FAMILY DISAGREEMENTS AS HE
WOULD HAVE IT THAT IT DID REALLY YOU KNOW SIR IT WAS IN HIS SINKING
FRAME
WE MIGHT HAVE GOT ON TOLERABLY NOTWITHSTANDING BUT FOR TWO
PEOPLE MISS CATHY AND JOSEPH THE SERVANT YOU SAW HIM I DARESAY UP
YONDER
HE WAS AND IS YET MOST LIKELY THE WEARISOMEST SELF RIGHTEOUS
PHARISEE THAT EVER RANSACKED A BIBLE TO RAKE THE PROMISES TO HIMSELF AND
FLING THE CURSES TO HIS NEIGHBOURS
BY HIS KNACK OF SERMONISING AND
PIOUS DISCOURSING HE CONTRIVED TO MAKE A GREAT IMPRESSION ON MR
EARNSHAW AND THE MORE FEEBLE THE MASTER BECAME THE MORE INFLUENCE HE
GAINED
HE WAS RELENTLESS IN WORRYING HIM ABOUT HIS SOUL'S CONCERNS AND
ABOUT RULING HIS CHILDREN RIGIDLY
HE ENCOURAGED HIM TO REGARD HINDLEY
AS A REPROBATE AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE REGULARLY GRUMBLED OUT A LONG
STRING OF TALES AGAINST HEATHCLIFF AND CATHERINE ALWAYS MINDING TO
FLATTER EARNSHAW'S WEAKNESS BY HEAPING THE HEAVIEST BLAME ON THE LATTER
CERTAINLY SHE HAD WAYS WITH HER SUCH AS I NEVER SAW A CHILD TAKE UP
BEFORE AND SHE PUT ALL OF US PAST OUR PATIENCE FIFTY TIMES AND OFTENER
IN A DAY FROM THE HOUR SHE CAME DOWN STAIRS TILL THE HOUR SHE WENT TO
BED WE HAD NOT A MINUTE'S SECURITY THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE IN MISCHIEF
HER
SPIRITS WERE ALWAYS AT HIGH WATER MARK HER TONGUE ALWAYS GOING SINGING
LAUGHING AND PLAGUING EVERYBODY WHO WOULD NOT DO THE SAME
A WILD
WICKED SLIP SHE WAS BUT SHE HAD THE BONNIEST EYE THE SWEETEST SMILE
AND LIGHTEST FOOT IN THE PARISH AND AFTER ALL I BELIEVE SHE MEANT NO
HARM FOR WHEN ONCE SHE MADE YOU CRY IN GOOD EARNEST IT SELDOM HAPPENED
THAT SHE WOULD NOT KEEP YOU COMPANY AND OBLIGE YOU TO BE QUIET THAT YOU
MIGHT COMFORT HER
SHE WAS MUCH TOO FOND OF HEATHCLIFF
THE GREATEST
PUNISHMENT WE COULD INVENT FOR HER WAS TO KEEP HER SEPARATE FROM HIM YET
SHE GOT CHIDED MORE THAN ANY OF US ON HIS ACCOUNT
IN PLAY SHE LIKED
EXCEEDINGLY TO ACT THE LITTLE MISTRESS USING HER HANDS FREELY AND
COMMANDING HER COMPANIONS SHE DID SO TO ME BUT I WOULD NOT BEAR
SLAPPING AND ORDERING AND SO I LET HER KNOW
NOW MR
EARNSHAW DID NOT UNDERSTAND JOKES FROM HIS CHILDREN HE HAD
ALWAYS BEEN STRICT AND GRAVE WITH THEM AND CATHERINE ON HER PART HAD
NO IDEA WHY HER FATHER SHOULD BE CROSSER AND LESS PATIENT IN HIS AILING
CONDITION THAN HE WAS IN HIS PRIME
HIS PEEVISH REPROOFS WAKENED IN HER
A NAUGHTY DELIGHT TO PROVOKE HIM SHE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN WE WERE
ALL SCOLDING HER AT ONCE AND SHE DEFYING US WITH HER BOLD SAUCY LOOK
AND HER READY WORDS TURNING JOSEPH'S RELIGIOUS CURSES INTO RIDICULE
BAITING ME AND DOING JUST WHAT HER FATHER HATED MOST SHOWING HOW HER
PRETENDED INSOLENCE WHICH HE THOUGHT REAL HAD MORE POWER OVER
HEATHCLIFF THAN HIS KINDNESS HOW THE BOY WOULD DO HER BIDDING IN
ANYTHING AND HIS ONLY WHEN IT SUITED HIS OWN INCLINATION
AFTER
BEHAVING AS BADLY AS POSSIBLE ALL DAY SHE SOMETIMES CAME FONDLING TO
MAKE IT UP AT NIGHT
'NAY CATHY THE OLD MAN WOULD SAY 'I CANNOT LOVE
THEE THOU'RT WORSE THAN THY BROTHER
GO SAY THY PRAYERS CHILD AND
ASK GOD'S PARDON
I DOUBT THY MOTHER AND I MUST RUE THAT WE EVER REARED
THEE THAT MADE HER CRY AT FIRST AND THEN BEING REPULSED CONTINUALLY
HARDENED HER AND SHE LAUGHED IF I TOLD HER TO SAY SHE WAS SORRY FOR HER
FAULTS AND BEG TO BE FORGIVEN
BUT THE HOUR CAME AT LAST THAT ENDED MR
EARNSHAW'S TROUBLES ON EARTH
HE DIED QUIETLY IN HIS CHAIR ONE OCTOBER EVENING SEATED BY THE
FIRE SIDE
A HIGH WIND BLUSTERED ROUND THE HOUSE AND ROARED IN THE
CHIMNEY IT SOUNDED WILD AND STORMY YET IT WAS NOT COLD AND WE WERE ALL
TOGETHER I A LITTLE REMOVED FROM THE HEARTH BUSY AT MY KNITTING AND
JOSEPH READING HIS BIBLE NEAR THE TABLE FOR THE SERVANTS GENERALLY SAT
IN THE HOUSE THEN AFTER THEIR WORK WAS DONE
MISS CATHY HAD BEEN SICK
AND THAT MADE HER STILL SHE LEANT AGAINST HER FATHER'S KNEE AND
HEATHCLIFF WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS HEAD IN HER LAP
I REMEMBER
THE MASTER BEFORE HE FELL INTO A DOZE STROKING HER BONNY HAIR IT
PLEASED HIM RARELY TO SEE HER GENTLE AND SAYING 'WHY CANST THOU NOT
ALWAYS BE A GOOD LASS CATHY AND SHE TURNED HER FACE UP TO HIS AND
LAUGHED AND ANSWERED 'WHY CANNOT YOU ALWAYS BE A GOOD MAN FATHER BUT
AS SOON AS SHE SAW HIM VEXED AGAIN SHE KISSED HIS HAND AND SAID SHE
WOULD SING HIM TO SLEEP
SHE BEGAN SINGING VERY LOW TILL HIS FINGERS
DROPPED FROM HERS AND HIS HEAD SANK ON HIS BREAST
THEN I TOLD HER TO
HUSH AND NOT STIR FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD WAKE HIM
WE ALL KEPT AS MUTE AS
MICE A FULL HALF HOUR AND SHOULD HAVE DONE SO LONGER ONLY JOSEPH
HAVING FINISHED HIS CHAPTER GOT UP AND SAID THAT HE MUST ROUSE THE
MASTER FOR PRAYERS AND BED
HE STEPPED FORWARD AND CALLED HIM BY NAME
AND TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER BUT HE WOULD NOT MOVE SO HE TOOK THE CANDLE
AND LOOKED AT HIM
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AS HE SET DOWN
THE LIGHT AND SEIZING THE CHILDREN EACH BY AN ARM WHISPERED THEM TO
'FRAME UP STAIRS AND MAKE LITTLE DIN THEY MIGHT PRAY ALONE THAT
EVENING HE HAD SUMMUT TO DO
'I SHALL BID FATHER GOOD NIGHT FIRST SAID CATHERINE PUTTING HER ARMS
ROUND HIS NECK BEFORE WE COULD HINDER HER
THE POOR THING DISCOVERED
HER LOSS DIRECTLY SHE SCREAMED OUT 'OH HE'S DEAD HEATHCLIFF HE'S
DEAD AND THEY BOTH SET UP A HEART BREAKING CRY
I JOINED MY WAIL TO THEIRS LOUD AND BITTER BUT JOSEPH ASKED WHAT WE
COULD BE THINKING OF TO ROAR IN THAT WAY OVER A SAINT IN HEAVEN
HE TOLD
ME TO PUT ON MY CLOAK AND RUN TO GIMMERTON FOR THE DOCTOR AND THE PARSON
I COULD NOT GUESS THE USE THAT EITHER WOULD BE OF THEN
HOWEVER I
WENT THROUGH WIND AND RAIN AND BROUGHT ONE THE DOCTOR BACK WITH ME
THE OTHER SAID HE WOULD COME IN THE MORNING
LEAVING JOSEPH TO EXPLAIN
MATTERS I RAN TO THE CHILDREN'S ROOM THEIR DOOR WAS AJAR I SAW THEY
HAD NEVER LAIN DOWN THOUGH IT WAS PAST MIDNIGHT BUT THEY WERE CALMER
AND DID NOT NEED ME TO CONSOLE THEM
THE LITTLE SOULS WERE COMFORTING
EACH OTHER WITH BETTER THOUGHTS THAN I COULD HAVE HIT ON NO PARSON IN
THE WORLD EVER PICTURED HEAVEN SO BEAUTIFULLY AS THEY DID IN THEIR
INNOCENT TALK AND WHILE I SOBBED AND LISTENED I COULD NOT HELP WISHING
WE WERE ALL THERE SAFE TOGETHER
CHAPTER VI
MR
HINDLEY CAME HOME TO THE FUNERAL AND A THING THAT AMAZED US AND
SET THE NEIGHBOURS GOSSIPING RIGHT AND LEFT HE BROUGHT A WIFE WITH HIM
WHAT SHE WAS AND WHERE SHE WAS BORN HE NEVER INFORMED US PROBABLY SHE
HAD NEITHER MONEY NOR NAME TO RECOMMEND HER OR HE WOULD SCARCELY HAVE
KEPT THE UNION FROM HIS FATHER
SHE WAS NOT ONE THAT WOULD HAVE DISTURBED THE HOUSE MUCH ON HER OWN
ACCOUNT
EVERY OBJECT SHE SAW THE MOMENT SHE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD
APPEARED TO DELIGHT HER AND EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT TOOK PLACE ABOUT
HER EXCEPT THE PREPARING FOR THE BURIAL AND THE PRESENCE OF THE
MOURNERS
I THOUGHT SHE WAS HALF SILLY FROM HER BEHAVIOUR WHILE THAT
WENT ON SHE RAN INTO HER CHAMBER AND MADE ME COME WITH HER THOUGH I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DRESSING THE CHILDREN AND THERE SHE SAT SHIVERING AND
CLASPING HER HANDS AND ASKING REPEATEDLY 'ARE THEY GONE YET THEN SHE
BEGAN DESCRIBING WITH HYSTERICAL EMOTION THE EFFECT IT PRODUCED ON HER TO
SEE BLACK AND STARTED AND TREMBLED AND AT LAST FELL A WEEPING AND
WHEN I ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER ANSWERED SHE DIDN'T KNOW BUT SHE FELT
SO AFRAID OF DYING I IMAGINED HER AS LITTLE LIKELY TO DIE AS MYSELF
SHE WAS RATHER THIN BUT YOUNG AND FRESH COMPLEXIONED AND HER EYES
SPARKLED AS BRIGHT AS DIAMONDS
I DID REMARK TO BE SURE THAT MOUNTING
THE STAIRS MADE HER BREATHE VERY QUICK THAT THE LEAST SUDDEN NOISE SET
HER ALL IN A QUIVER AND THAT SHE COUGHED TROUBLESOMELY SOMETIMES BUT I
KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT THESE SYMPTOMS PORTENDED AND HAD NO IMPULSE TO
SYMPATHISE WITH HER
WE DON'T IN GENERAL TAKE TO FOREIGNERS HERE MR
LOCKWOOD UNLESS THEY TAKE TO US FIRST
YOUNG EARNSHAW WAS ALTERED CONSIDERABLY IN THE THREE YEARS OF HIS
ABSENCE
HE HAD GROWN SPARER AND LOST HIS COLOUR AND SPOKE AND DRESSED
QUITE DIFFERENTLY AND ON THE VERY DAY OF HIS RETURN HE TOLD JOSEPH
AND ME WE MUST THENCEFORTH QUARTER OURSELVES IN THE BACK KITCHEN AND
LEAVE THE HOUSE FOR HIM
INDEED HE WOULD HAVE CARPETED AND PAPERED A
SMALL SPARE ROOM FOR A PARLOUR BUT HIS WIFE EXPRESSED SUCH PLEASURE AT
THE WHITE FLOOR AND HUGE GLOWING FIREPLACE AT THE PEWTER DISHES AND
DELF CASE AND DOG KENNEL AND THE WIDE SPACE THERE WAS TO MOVE ABOUT IN
WHERE THEY USUALLY SAT THAT HE THOUGHT IT UNNECESSARY TO HER COMFORT
AND SO DROPPED THE INTENTION
SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE TOO AT FINDING A SISTER AMONG HER NEW
ACQUAINTANCE AND SHE PRATTLED TO CATHERINE AND KISSED HER AND RAN
ABOUT WITH HER AND GAVE HER QUANTITIES OF PRESENTS AT THE BEGINNING
HER AFFECTION TIRED VERY SOON HOWEVER AND WHEN SHE GREW PEEVISH
HINDLEY BECAME TYRANNICAL
A FEW WORDS FROM HER EVINCING A DISLIKE TO
HEATHCLIFF WERE ENOUGH TO ROUSE IN HIM ALL HIS OLD HATRED OF THE BOY
HE
DROVE HIM FROM THEIR COMPANY TO THE SERVANTS DEPRIVED HIM OF THE
INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CURATE AND INSISTED THAT HE SHOULD LABOUR OUT OF
DOORS INSTEAD COMPELLING HIM TO DO SO AS HARD AS ANY OTHER LAD ON THE
FARM
HEATHCLIFF BORE HIS DEGRADATION PRETTY WELL AT FIRST BECAUSE CATHY
TAUGHT HIM WHAT SHE LEARNT AND WORKED OR PLAYED WITH HIM IN THE FIELDS
THEY BOTH PROMISED FAIR TO GROW UP AS RUDE AS SAVAGES THE YOUNG MASTER
BEING ENTIRELY NEGLIGENT HOW THEY BEHAVED AND WHAT THEY DID SO THEY
KEPT CLEAR OF HIM
HE WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE SEEN AFTER THEIR GOING TO
CHURCH ON SUNDAYS ONLY JOSEPH AND THE CURATE REPRIMANDED HIS
CARELESSNESS WHEN THEY ABSENTED THEMSELVES AND THAT REMINDED HIM TO
ORDER HEATHCLIFF A FLOGGING AND CATHERINE A FAST FROM DINNER OR SUPPER
BUT IT WAS ONE OF THEIR CHIEF AMUSEMENTS TO RUN AWAY TO THE MOORS IN THE
MORNING AND REMAIN THERE ALL DAY AND THE AFTER PUNISHMENT GREW A MERE
THING TO LAUGH AT
THE CURATE MIGHT SET AS MANY CHAPTERS AS HE PLEASED
FOR CATHERINE TO GET BY HEART AND JOSEPH MIGHT THRASH HEATHCLIFF TILL
HIS ARM ACHED THEY FORGOT EVERYTHING THE MINUTE THEY WERE TOGETHER
AGAIN AT LEAST THE MINUTE THEY HAD CONTRIVED SOME NAUGHTY PLAN OF
REVENGE AND MANY A TIME I'VE CRIED TO MYSELF TO WATCH THEM GROWING MORE
RECKLESS DAILY AND I NOT DARING TO SPEAK A SYLLABLE FOR FEAR OF LOSING
THE SMALL POWER I STILL RETAINED OVER THE UNFRIENDED CREATURES
ONE
SUNDAY EVENING IT CHANCED THAT THEY WERE BANISHED FROM THE SITTING ROOM
FOR MAKING A NOISE OR A LIGHT OFFENCE OF THE KIND AND WHEN I WENT TO
CALL THEM TO SUPPER I COULD DISCOVER THEM NOWHERE
WE SEARCHED THE
HOUSE ABOVE AND BELOW AND THE YARD AND STABLES THEY WERE INVISIBLE
AND AT LAST HINDLEY IN A PASSION TOLD US TO BOLT THE DOORS AND SWORE
NOBODY SHOULD LET THEM IN THAT NIGHT
THE HOUSEHOLD WENT TO BED AND I
TOO ANXIOUS TO LIE DOWN OPENED MY LATTICE AND PUT MY HEAD OUT TO
HEARKEN THOUGH IT RAINED DETERMINED TO ADMIT THEM IN SPITE OF THE
PROHIBITION SHOULD THEY RETURN
IN A WHILE I DISTINGUISHED STEPS
COMING UP THE ROAD AND THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN GLIMMERED THROUGH THE
GATE
I THREW A SHAWL OVER MY HEAD AND RAN TO PREVENT THEM FROM WAKING
MR
EARNSHAW BY KNOCKING
THERE WAS HEATHCLIFF BY HIMSELF IT GAVE ME A
START TO SEE HIM ALONE
'WHERE IS MISS CATHERINE I CRIED HURRIEDLY
'NO ACCIDENT I HOPE 'AT
THRUSHCROSS GRANGE HE ANSWERED 'AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE TOO BUT
THEY HAD NOT THE MANNERS TO ASK ME TO STAY 'WELL YOU WILL CATCH IT
I SAID 'YOU'LL NEVER BE CONTENT TILL YOU'RE SENT ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS
WHAT IN THE WORLD LED YOU WANDERING TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE 'LET ME GET
OFF MY WET CLOTHES AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT NELLY HE REPLIED
I BID HIM BEWARE OF ROUSING THE MASTER AND WHILE HE UNDRESSED AND I
WAITED TO PUT OUT THE CANDLE HE CONTINUED 'CATHY AND I ESCAPED FROM
THE WASH HOUSE TO HAVE A RAMBLE AT LIBERTY AND GETTING A GLIMPSE OF THE
GRANGE LIGHTS WE THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST GO AND SEE WHETHER THE LINTONS
PASSED THEIR SUNDAY EVENINGS STANDING SHIVERING IN CORNERS WHILE THEIR
FATHER AND MOTHER SAT EATING AND DRINKING AND SINGING AND LAUGHING AND
BURNING THEIR EYES OUT BEFORE THE FIRE
DO YOU THINK THEY DO OR READING
SERMONS AND BEING CATECHISED BY THEIR MANSERVANT AND SET TO LEARN A
COLUMN OF SCRIPTURE NAMES IF THEY DON'T ANSWER PROPERLY 'PROBABLY
NOT I RESPONDED
'THEY ARE GOOD CHILDREN NO DOUBT AND DON'T DESERVE
THE TREATMENT YOU RECEIVE FOR YOUR BAD CONDUCT 'DON'T CANT NELLY
HE SAID 'NONSENSE WE RAN FROM THE TOP OF THE HEIGHTS TO THE PARK
WITHOUT STOPPING CATHERINE COMPLETELY BEATEN IN THE RACE BECAUSE SHE
WAS BAREFOOT
YOU'LL HAVE TO SEEK FOR HER SHOES IN THE BOG TO MORROW
WE
CREPT THROUGH A BROKEN HEDGE GROPED OUR WAY UP THE PATH AND PLANTED
OURSELVES ON A FLOWER PLOT UNDER THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW
THE LIGHT CAME
FROM THENCE THEY HAD NOT PUT UP THE SHUTTERS AND THE CURTAINS WERE
ONLY HALF CLOSED
BOTH OF US WERE ABLE TO LOOK IN BY STANDING ON THE
BASEMENT AND CLINGING TO THE LEDGE AND WE SAW AH IT WAS BEAUTIFUL A
SPLENDID PLACE CARPETED WITH CRIMSON AND CRIMSON COVERED CHAIRS AND
TABLES AND A PURE WHITE CEILING BORDERED BY GOLD A SHOWER OF
GLASS DROPS HANGING IN SILVER CHAINS FROM THE CENTRE AND SHIMMERING
WITH LITTLE SOFT TAPERS
OLD MR
AND MRS
LINTON WERE NOT THERE EDGAR
AND HIS SISTERS HAD IT ENTIRELY TO THEMSELVES
SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE BEEN
HAPPY WE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OURSELVES IN HEAVEN AND NOW GUESS WHAT
YOUR GOOD CHILDREN WERE DOING ISABELLA I BELIEVE SHE IS ELEVEN A YEAR
YOUNGER THAN CATHY LAY SCREAMING AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM
SHRIEKING AS IF WITCHES WERE RUNNING RED HOT NEEDLES INTO HER
EDGAR
STOOD ON THE HEARTH WEEPING SILENTLY AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE SAT
A LITTLE DOG SHAKING ITS PAW AND YELPING WHICH FROM THEIR MUTUAL
ACCUSATIONS WE UNDERSTOOD THEY HAD NEARLY PULLED IN TWO BETWEEN THEM
THE IDIOTS THAT WAS THEIR PLEASURE TO QUARREL WHO SHOULD HOLD A HEAP
OF WARM HAIR AND EACH BEGIN TO CRY BECAUSE BOTH AFTER STRUGGLING TO
GET IT REFUSED TO TAKE IT
WE LAUGHED OUTRIGHT AT THE PETTED THINGS WE
DID DESPISE THEM WHEN WOULD YOU CATCH ME WISHING TO HAVE WHAT CATHERINE
WANTED OR FIND US BY OURSELVES SEEKING ENTERTAINMENT IN YELLING AND
SOBBING AND ROLLING ON THE GROUND DIVIDED BY THE WHOLE ROOM I'D NOT
EXCHANGE FOR A THOUSAND LIVES MY CONDITION HERE FOR EDGAR LINTON'S AT
THRUSHCROSS GRANGE NOT IF I MIGHT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF FLINGING JOSEPH
OFF THE HIGHEST GABLE AND PAINTING THE HOUSE FRONT WITH HINDLEY'S
BLOOD
'HUSH HUSH I INTERRUPTED
'STILL YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME HEATHCLIFF
HOW CATHERINE IS LEFT BEHIND
'I TOLD YOU WE LAUGHED HE ANSWERED
'THE LINTONS HEARD US AND WITH
ONE ACCORD THEY SHOT LIKE ARROWS TO THE DOOR THERE WAS SILENCE AND
THEN A CRY OH MAMMA MAMMA OH PAPA OH MAMMA COME HERE
OH PAPA
OH THEY REALLY DID HOWL OUT SOMETHING IN THAT WAY
WE MADE FRIGHTFUL
NOISES TO TERRIFY THEM STILL MORE AND THEN WE DROPPED OFF THE LEDGE
BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS DRAWING THE BARS AND WE FELT WE HAD BETTER FLEE
I
HAD CATHY BY THE HAND AND WAS URGING HER ON WHEN ALL AT ONCE SHE FELL
DOWN
RUN HEATHCLIFF RUN SHE WHISPERED
THEY HAVE LET THE BULL DOG
LOOSE AND HE HOLDS ME THE DEVIL HAD SEIZED HER ANKLE NELLY I HEARD
HIS ABOMINABLE SNORTING
SHE DID NOT YELL OUT NO SHE WOULD HAVE
SCORNED TO DO IT IF SHE HAD BEEN SPITTED ON THE HORNS OF A MAD COW
I
DID THOUGH I VOCIFERATED CURSES ENOUGH TO ANNIHILATE ANY FIEND IN
CHRISTENDOM AND I GOT A STONE AND THRUST IT BETWEEN HIS JAWS AND TRIED
WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO CRAM IT DOWN HIS THROAT
A BEAST OF A SERVANT CAME
UP WITH A LANTERN AT LAST SHOUTING KEEP FAST SKULKER KEEP FAST
HE CHANGED HIS NOTE HOWEVER WHEN HE SAW SKULKER'S GAME
THE DOG WAS
THROTTLED OFF HIS HUGE PURPLE TONGUE HANGING HALF A FOOT OUT OF HIS
MOUTH AND HIS PENDENT LIPS STREAMING WITH BLOODY SLAVER
THE MAN TOOK
CATHY UP SHE WAS SICK NOT FROM FEAR I'M CERTAIN BUT FROM PAIN
HE
CARRIED HER IN I FOLLOWED GRUMBLING EXECRATIONS AND VENGEANCE
WHAT
PREY ROBERT HALLOOED LINTON FROM THE ENTRANCE
SKULKER HAS CAUGHT A
LITTLE GIRL SIR HE REPLIED AND THERE'S A LAD HERE HE ADDED
MAKING A CLUTCH AT ME WHO LOOKS AN OUT AND OUTER VERY LIKE THE
ROBBERS WERE FOR PUTTING THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW TO OPEN THE DOORS TO
THE GANG AFTER ALL WERE ASLEEP THAT THEY MIGHT MURDER US AT THEIR EASE
HOLD YOUR TONGUE YOU FOUL MOUTHED THIEF YOU YOU SHALL GO TO THE
GALLOWS FOR THIS
MR
LINTON SIR DON'T LAY BY YOUR GUN NO NO
ROBERT SAID THE OLD FOOL
THE RASCALS KNEW THAT YESTERDAY WAS MY
RENT DAY THEY THOUGHT TO HAVE ME CLEVERLY
COME IN I'LL FURNISH THEM A
RECEPTION
THERE JOHN FASTEN THE CHAIN
GIVE SKULKER SOME WATER
JENNY
TO BEARD A MAGISTRATE IN HIS STRONGHOLD AND ON THE SABBATH TOO
WHERE WILL THEIR INSOLENCE STOP OH MY DEAR MARY LOOK HERE DON'T BE
AFRAID IT IS BUT A BOY YET THE VILLAIN SCOWLS SO PLAINLY IN HIS FACE
WOULD IT NOT BE A KINDNESS TO THE COUNTRY TO HANG HIM AT ONCE BEFORE HE
SHOWS HIS NATURE IN ACTS AS WELL AS FEATURES HE PULLED ME UNDER THE
CHANDELIER AND MRS
LINTON PLACED HER SPECTACLES ON HER NOSE AND RAISED
HER HANDS IN HORROR
THE COWARDLY CHILDREN CREPT NEARER ALSO ISABELLA
LISPING FRIGHTFUL THING PUT HIM IN THE CELLAR PAPA
HE'S EXACTLY
LIKE THE SON OF THE FORTUNE TELLER THAT STOLE MY TAME PHEASANT
ISN'T
HE EDGAR
'WHILE THEY EXAMINED ME CATHY CAME ROUND SHE HEARD THE LAST SPEECH AND
LAUGHED
EDGAR LINTON AFTER AN INQUISITIVE STARE COLLECTED SUFFICIENT
WIT TO RECOGNISE HER
THEY SEE US AT CHURCH YOU KNOW THOUGH WE SELDOM
MEET THEM ELSEWHERE
THAT'S MISS EARNSHAW HE WHISPERED TO HIS MOTHER
AND LOOK HOW SKULKER HAS BITTEN HER HOW HER FOOT BLEEDS
MISS EARNSHAW NONSENSE CRIED THE DAME MISS EARNSHAW SCOURING THE
COUNTRY WITH A GIPSY AND YET MY DEAR THE CHILD IS IN MOURNING SURELY
IT IS AND SHE MAY BE LAMED FOR LIFE
WHAT CULPABLE CARELESSNESS IN HER BROTHER EXCLAIMED MR
LINTON
TURNING FROM ME TO CATHERINE
I'VE UNDERSTOOD FROM SHIELDERS THAT
WAS THE CURATE SIR THAT HE LETS HER GROW UP IN ABSOLUTE HEATHENISM
BUT WHO IS THIS WHERE DID SHE PICK UP THIS COMPANION OHO I DECLARE
HE IS THAT STRANGE ACQUISITION MY LATE NEIGHBOUR MADE IN HIS JOURNEY TO
LIVERPOOL A LITTLE LASCAR OR AN AMERICAN OR SPANISH CASTAWAY
A WICKED BOY AT ALL EVENTS REMARKED THE OLD LADY AND QUITE UNFIT
FOR A DECENT HOUSE DID YOU NOTICE HIS LANGUAGE LINTON I'M SHOCKED
THAT MY CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE HEARD IT
'I RECOMMENCED CURSING DON'T BE ANGRY NELLY AND SO ROBERT WAS ORDERED
TO TAKE ME OFF
I REFUSED TO GO WITHOUT CATHY HE DRAGGED ME INTO THE
GARDEN PUSHED THE LANTERN INTO MY HAND ASSURED ME THAT MR
EARNSHAW
SHOULD BE INFORMED OF MY BEHAVIOUR AND BIDDING ME MARCH DIRECTLY
SECURED THE DOOR AGAIN
THE CURTAINS WERE STILL LOOPED UP AT ONE CORNER
AND I RESUMED MY STATION AS SPY BECAUSE IF CATHERINE HAD WISHED TO
RETURN I INTENDED SHATTERING THEIR GREAT GLASS PANES TO A MILLION OF
FRAGMENTS UNLESS THEY LET HER OUT
SHE SAT ON THE SOFA QUIETLY
MRS
LINTON TOOK OFF THE GREY CLOAK OF THE DAIRY MAID WHICH WE HAD BORROWED
FOR OUR EXCURSION SHAKING HER HEAD AND EXPOSTULATING WITH HER I
SUPPOSE SHE WAS A YOUNG LADY AND THEY MADE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN HER
TREATMENT AND MINE
THEN THE WOMAN SERVANT BROUGHT A BASIN OF WARM
WATER AND WASHED HER FEET AND MR
LINTON MIXED A TUMBLER OF NEGUS AND
ISABELLA EMPTIED A PLATEFUL OF CAKES INTO HER LAP AND EDGAR STOOD GAPING
AT A DISTANCE
AFTERWARDS THEY DRIED AND COMBED HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR AND
GAVE HER A PAIR OF ENORMOUS SLIPPERS AND WHEELED HER TO THE FIRE AND I
LEFT HER AS MERRY AS SHE COULD BE DIVIDING HER FOOD BETWEEN THE LITTLE
DOG AND SKULKER WHOSE NOSE SHE PINCHED AS HE ATE AND KINDLING A SPARK
OF SPIRIT IN THE VACANT BLUE EYES OF THE LINTONS A DIM REFLECTION FROM
HER OWN ENCHANTING FACE
I SAW THEY WERE FULL OF STUPID ADMIRATION SHE
IS SO IMMEASURABLY SUPERIOR TO THEM TO EVERYBODY ON EARTH IS SHE NOT
NELLY
'THERE WILL MORE COME OF THIS BUSINESS THAN YOU RECKON ON I ANSWERED
COVERING HIM UP AND EXTINGUISHING THE LIGHT
'YOU ARE INCURABLE
HEATHCLIFF AND MR
HINDLEY WILL HAVE TO PROCEED TO EXTREMITIES SEE IF
HE WON'T MY WORDS CAME TRUER THAN I DESIRED
THE LUCKLESS ADVENTURE
MADE EARNSHAW FURIOUS
AND THEN MR
LINTON TO MEND MATTERS PAID US A
VISIT HIMSELF ON THE MORROW AND READ THE YOUNG MASTER SUCH A LECTURE ON
THE ROAD HE GUIDED HIS FAMILY THAT HE WAS STIRRED TO LOOK ABOUT HIM IN
EARNEST
HEATHCLIFF RECEIVED NO FLOGGING BUT HE WAS TOLD THAT THE FIRST
WORD HE SPOKE TO MISS CATHERINE SHOULD ENSURE A DISMISSAL AND MRS
EARNSHAW UNDERTOOK TO KEEP HER SISTER IN LAW IN DUE RESTRAINT WHEN SHE
RETURNED HOME EMPLOYING ART NOT FORCE WITH FORCE SHE WOULD HAVE FOUND
IT IMPOSSIBLE
CHAPTER VII
CATHY STAYED AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE FIVE WEEKS TILL CHRISTMAS
BY THAT
TIME HER ANKLE WAS THOROUGHLY CURED AND HER MANNERS MUCH IMPROVED
THE
MISTRESS VISITED HER OFTEN IN THE INTERVAL AND COMMENCED HER PLAN OF
REFORM BY TRYING TO RAISE HER SELF RESPECT WITH FINE CLOTHES AND
FLATTERY WHICH SHE TOOK READILY SO THAT INSTEAD OF A WILD HATLESS
LITTLE SAVAGE JUMPING INTO THE HOUSE AND RUSHING TO SQUEEZE US ALL
BREATHLESS THERE 'LIGHTED FROM A HANDSOME BLACK PONY A VERY DIGNIFIED
PERSON WITH BROWN RINGLETS FALLING FROM THE COVER OF A FEATHERED BEAVER
AND A LONG CLOTH HABIT WHICH SHE WAS OBLIGED TO HOLD UP WITH BOTH HANDS
THAT SHE MIGHT SAIL IN
HINDLEY LIFTED HER FROM HER HORSE EXCLAIMING
DELIGHTEDLY 'WHY CATHY YOU ARE QUITE A BEAUTY I SHOULD SCARCELY HAVE
KNOWN YOU YOU LOOK LIKE A LADY NOW
ISABELLA LINTON IS NOT TO BE
COMPARED WITH HER IS SHE FRANCES 'ISABELLA HAS NOT HER NATURAL
ADVANTAGES REPLIED HIS WIFE 'BUT SHE MUST MIND AND NOT GROW WILD AGAIN
HERE
ELLEN HELP MISS CATHERINE OFF WITH HER THINGS STAY DEAR YOU
WILL DISARRANGE YOUR CURLS LET ME UNTIE YOUR HAT
I REMOVED THE HABIT AND THERE SHONE FORTH BENEATH A GRAND PLAID SILK
FROCK WHITE TROUSERS AND BURNISHED SHOES AND WHILE HER EYES SPARKLED
JOYFULLY WHEN THE DOGS CAME BOUNDING UP TO WELCOME HER SHE DARED HARDLY
TOUCH THEM LEST THEY SHOULD FAWN UPON HER SPLENDID GARMENTS
SHE KISSED
ME GENTLY I WAS ALL FLOUR MAKING THE CHRISTMAS CAKE AND IT WOULD NOT
HAVE DONE TO GIVE ME A HUG AND THEN SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR HEATHCLIFF
MR
AND MRS
EARNSHAW WATCHED ANXIOUSLY THEIR MEETING THINKING IT WOULD
ENABLE THEM TO JUDGE IN SOME MEASURE WHAT GROUNDS THEY HAD FOR HOPING
TO SUCCEED IN SEPARATING THE TWO FRIENDS
HEATHCLIFF WAS HARD TO DISCOVER AT FIRST
IF HE WERE CARELESS AND
UNCARED FOR BEFORE CATHERINE'S ABSENCE HE HAD BEEN TEN TIMES MORE SO
SINCE
NOBODY BUT I EVEN DID HIM THE KINDNESS TO CALL HIM A DIRTY BOY
AND BID HIM WASH HIMSELF ONCE A WEEK AND CHILDREN OF HIS AGE SELDOM
HAVE A NATURAL PLEASURE IN SOAP AND WATER
THEREFORE NOT TO MENTION HIS
CLOTHES WHICH HAD SEEN THREE MONTHS' SERVICE IN MIRE AND DUST AND HIS
THICK UNCOMBED HAIR THE SURFACE OF HIS FACE AND HANDS WAS DISMALLY
BECLOUDED
HE MIGHT WELL SKULK BEHIND THE SETTLE ON BEHOLDING SUCH A
BRIGHT GRACEFUL DAMSEL ENTER THE HOUSE INSTEAD OF A ROUGH HEADED
COUNTERPART OF HIMSELF AS HE EXPECTED
'IS HEATHCLIFF NOT HERE SHE
DEMANDED PULLING OFF HER GLOVES AND DISPLAYING FINGERS WONDERFULLY
WHITENED WITH DOING NOTHING AND STAYING INDOORS
'HEATHCLIFF YOU MAY COME FORWARD CRIED MR
HINDLEY ENJOYING HIS
DISCOMFITURE AND GRATIFIED TO SEE WHAT A FORBIDDING YOUNG BLACKGUARD HE
WOULD BE COMPELLED TO PRESENT HIMSELF
'YOU MAY COME AND WISH MISS
CATHERINE WELCOME LIKE THE OTHER SERVANTS
CATHY CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF HER FRIEND IN HIS CONCEALMENT FLEW TO
EMBRACE HIM SHE BESTOWED SEVEN OR EIGHT KISSES ON HIS CHEEK WITHIN THE
SECOND AND THEN STOPPED AND DRAWING BACK BURST INTO A LAUGH
EXCLAIMING 'WHY HOW VERY BLACK AND CROSS YOU LOOK AND HOW HOW FUNNY
AND GRIM BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I'M USED TO EDGAR AND ISABELLA LINTON
WELL HEATHCLIFF HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ME
SHE HAD SOME REASON TO PUT THE QUESTION FOR SHAME AND PRIDE THREW DOUBLE
GLOOM OVER HIS COUNTENANCE AND KEPT HIM IMMOVABLE
'SHAKE HANDS HEATHCLIFF SAID MR
EARNSHAW CONDESCENDINGLY 'ONCE IN A
WAY THAT IS PERMITTED
'I SHALL NOT REPLIED THE BOY FINDING HIS TONGUE AT LAST 'I SHALL NOT
STAND TO BE LAUGHED AT
I SHALL NOT BEAR IT AND HE WOULD HAVE BROKEN
FROM THE CIRCLE BUT MISS CATHY SEIZED HIM AGAIN
'I DID NOT MEAN TO LAUGH AT YOU SHE SAID 'I COULD NOT HINDER MYSELF
HEATHCLIFF SHAKE HANDS AT LEAST WHAT ARE YOU SULKY FOR IT WAS ONLY
THAT YOU LOOKED ODD
IF YOU WASH YOUR FACE AND BRUSH YOUR HAIR IT WILL
BE ALL RIGHT BUT YOU ARE SO DIRTY
SHE GAZED CONCERNEDLY AT THE DUSKY FINGERS SHE HELD IN HER OWN AND ALSO
AT HER DRESS WHICH SHE FEARED HAD GAINED NO EMBELLISHMENT FROM ITS
CONTACT WITH HIS
'YOU NEEDN'T HAVE TOUCHED ME HE ANSWERED FOLLOWING HER EYE AND
SNATCHING AWAY HIS HAND
'I SHALL BE AS DIRTY AS I PLEASE AND I LIKE TO
BE DIRTY AND I WILL BE DIRTY
WITH THAT HE DASHED HEADFOREMOST OUT OF THE ROOM AMID THE MERRIMENT OF
THE MASTER AND MISTRESS AND TO THE SERIOUS DISTURBANCE OF CATHERINE WHO
COULD NOT COMPREHEND HOW HER REMARKS SHOULD HAVE PRODUCED SUCH AN
EXHIBITION OF BAD TEMPER
AFTER PLAYING LADY'S MAID TO THE NEW COMER AND PUTTING MY CAKES IN THE
OVEN AND MAKING THE HOUSE AND KITCHEN CHEERFUL WITH GREAT FIRES
BEFITTING CHRISTMAS EVE I PREPARED TO SIT DOWN AND AMUSE MYSELF BY
SINGING CAROLS ALL ALONE REGARDLESS OF JOSEPH'S AFFIRMATIONS THAT HE
CONSIDERED THE MERRY TUNES I CHOSE AS NEXT DOOR TO SONGS
HE HAD RETIRED
TO PRIVATE PRAYER IN HIS CHAMBER AND MR
AND MRS
EARNSHAW WERE ENGAGING
MISSY'S ATTENTION BY SUNDRY GAY TRIFLES BOUGHT FOR HER TO PRESENT TO THE
LITTLE LINTONS AS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR KINDNESS
THEY HAD INVITED
THEM TO SPEND THE MORROW AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND THE INVITATION HAD
BEEN ACCEPTED ON ONE CONDITION MRS
LINTON BEGGED THAT HER DARLINGS
MIGHT BE KEPT CAREFULLY APART FROM THAT 'NAUGHTY SWEARING BOY
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES I REMAINED SOLITARY
I SMELT THE RICH SCENT OF
THE HEATING SPICES AND ADMIRED THE SHINING KITCHEN UTENSILS THE
POLISHED CLOCK DECKED IN HOLLY THE SILVER MUGS RANGED ON A TRAY READY
TO BE FILLED WITH MULLED ALE FOR SUPPER AND ABOVE ALL THE SPECKLESS
PURITY OF MY PARTICULAR CARE THE SCOURED AND WELL SWEPT FLOOR
I GAVE
DUE INWARD APPLAUSE TO EVERY OBJECT AND THEN I REMEMBERED HOW OLD
EARNSHAW USED TO COME IN WHEN ALL WAS TIDIED AND CALL ME A CANT LASS
AND SLIP A SHILLING INTO MY HAND AS A CHRISTMAS BOX AND FROM THAT I WENT
ON TO THINK OF HIS FONDNESS FOR HEATHCLIFF AND HIS DREAD LEST HE SHOULD
SUFFER NEGLECT AFTER DEATH HAD REMOVED HIM AND THAT NATURALLY LED ME TO
CONSIDER THE POOR LAD'S SITUATION NOW AND FROM SINGING I CHANGED MY MIND
TO CRYING
IT STRUCK ME SOON HOWEVER THERE WOULD BE MORE SENSE IN
ENDEAVOURING TO REPAIR SOME OF HIS WRONGS THAN SHEDDING TEARS OVER THEM
I GOT UP AND WALKED INTO THE COURT TO SEEK HIM
HE WAS NOT FAR I FOUND
HIM SMOOTHING THE GLOSSY COAT OF THE NEW PONY IN THE STABLE AND FEEDING
THE OTHER BEASTS ACCORDING TO CUSTOM
'MAKE HASTE HEATHCLIFF I SAID 'THE KITCHEN IS SO COMFORTABLE AND
JOSEPH IS UP STAIRS MAKE HASTE AND LET ME DRESS YOU SMART BEFORE MISS
CATHY COMES OUT AND THEN YOU CAN SIT TOGETHER WITH THE WHOLE HEARTH TO
YOURSELVES AND HAVE A LONG CHATTER TILL BEDTIME
HE PROCEEDED WITH HIS TASK AND NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS ME
'COME ARE YOU COMING I CONTINUED
'THERE'S A LITTLE CAKE FOR EACH OF
YOU NEARLY ENOUGH AND YOU'LL NEED HALF AN HOUR'S DONNING
I WAITED FIVE MINUTES BUT GETTING NO ANSWER LEFT HIM
CATHERINE SUPPED
WITH HER BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW JOSEPH AND I JOINED AT AN UNSOCIABLE
MEAL SEASONED WITH REPROOFS ON ONE SIDE AND SAUCINESS ON THE OTHER
HIS
CAKE AND CHEESE REMAINED ON THE TABLE ALL NIGHT FOR THE FAIRIES
HE
MANAGED TO CONTINUE WORK TILL NINE O'CLOCK AND THEN MARCHED DUMB AND
DOUR TO HIS CHAMBER
CATHY SAT UP LATE HAVING A WORLD OF THINGS TO
ORDER FOR THE RECEPTION OF HER NEW FRIENDS SHE CAME INTO THE KITCHEN
ONCE TO SPEAK TO HER OLD ONE BUT HE WAS GONE AND SHE ONLY STAYED TO ASK
WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND THEN WENT BACK
IN THE MORNING HE ROSE
EARLY AND AS IT WAS A HOLIDAY CARRIED HIS ILL HUMOUR ON TO THE MOORS
NOT RE APPEARING TILL THE FAMILY WERE DEPARTED FOR CHURCH
FASTING AND
REFLECTION SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT HIM TO A BETTER SPIRIT
HE HUNG ABOUT
ME FOR A WHILE AND HAVING SCREWED UP HIS COURAGE EXCLAIMED
ABRUPTLY 'NELLY MAKE ME DECENT I'M GOING TO BE GOOD
'HIGH TIME HEATHCLIFF I SAID 'YOU HAVE GRIEVED CATHERINE SHE'S
SORRY SHE EVER CAME HOME I DARESAY IT LOOKS AS IF YOU ENVIED HER
BECAUSE SHE IS MORE THOUGHT OF THAN YOU
THE NOTION OF ENVYING CATHERINE WAS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO HIM BUT THE
NOTION OF GRIEVING HER HE UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY ENOUGH
'DID SHE SAY SHE WAS GRIEVED HE INQUIRED LOOKING VERY SERIOUS
'SHE CRIED WHEN I TOLD HER YOU WERE OFF AGAIN THIS MORNING
'WELL I CRIED LAST NIGHT HE RETURNED 'AND I HAD MORE REASON TO CRY
THAN SHE
'YES YOU HAD THE REASON OF GOING TO BED WITH A PROUD HEART AND AN EMPTY
STOMACH SAID I
'PROUD PEOPLE BREED SAD SORROWS FOR THEMSELVES
BUT
IF YOU BE ASHAMED OF YOUR TOUCHINESS YOU MUST ASK PARDON MIND WHEN SHE
COMES IN
YOU MUST GO UP AND OFFER TO KISS HER AND SAY YOU KNOW BEST
WHAT TO SAY ONLY DO IT HEARTILY AND NOT AS IF YOU THOUGHT HER CONVERTED
INTO A STRANGER BY HER GRAND DRESS
AND NOW THOUGH I HAVE DINNER TO GET
READY I'LL STEAL TIME TO ARRANGE YOU SO THAT EDGAR LINTON SHALL LOOK
QUITE A DOLL BESIDE YOU AND THAT HE DOES
YOU ARE YOUNGER AND YET
I'LL BE BOUND YOU ARE TALLER AND TWICE AS BROAD ACROSS THE SHOULDERS
YOU COULD KNOCK HIM DOWN IN A TWINKLING DON'T YOU FEEL THAT YOU COULD
HEATHCLIFF'S FACE BRIGHTENED A MOMENT THEN IT WAS OVERCAST AFRESH AND
HE SIGHED
'BUT NELLY IF I KNOCKED HIM DOWN TWENTY TIMES THAT WOULDN'T MAKE HIM
LESS HANDSOME OR ME MORE SO
I WISH I HAD LIGHT HAIR AND A FAIR SKIN
AND WAS DRESSED AND BEHAVED AS WELL AND HAD A CHANCE OF BEING AS RICH AS
HE WILL BE
'AND CRIED FOR MAMMA AT EVERY TURN I ADDED 'AND TREMBLED IF A COUNTRY
LAD HEAVED HIS FIST AGAINST YOU AND SAT AT HOME ALL DAY FOR A SHOWER OF
RAIN
OH HEATHCLIFF YOU ARE SHOWING A POOR SPIRIT COME TO THE GLASS
AND I'LL LET YOU SEE WHAT YOU SHOULD WISH
DO YOU MARK THOSE TWO LINES
BETWEEN YOUR EYES AND THOSE THICK BROWS THAT INSTEAD OF RISING ARCHED
SINK IN THE MIDDLE AND THAT COUPLE OF BLACK FIENDS SO DEEPLY BURIED
WHO NEVER OPEN THEIR WINDOWS BOLDLY BUT LURK GLINTING UNDER THEM LIKE
DEVIL'S SPIES WISH AND LEARN TO SMOOTH AWAY THE SURLY WRINKLES TO
RAISE YOUR LIDS FRANKLY AND CHANGE THE FIENDS TO CONFIDENT INNOCENT
ANGELS SUSPECTING AND DOUBTING NOTHING AND ALWAYS SEEING FRIENDS WHERE
THEY ARE NOT SURE OF FOES
DON'T GET THE EXPRESSION OF A VICIOUS CUR
THAT APPEARS TO KNOW THE KICKS IT GETS ARE ITS DESERT AND YET HATES ALL
THE WORLD AS WELL AS THE KICKER FOR WHAT IT SUFFERS
'IN OTHER WORDS I MUST WISH FOR EDGAR LINTON'S GREAT BLUE EYES AND EVEN
FOREHEAD HE REPLIED
'I DO AND THAT WON'T HELP ME TO THEM
'A GOOD HEART WILL HELP YOU TO A BONNY FACE MY LAD I CONTINUED 'IF
YOU WERE A REGULAR BLACK AND A BAD ONE WILL TURN THE BONNIEST INTO
SOMETHING WORSE THAN UGLY
AND NOW THAT WE'VE DONE WASHING AND COMBING
AND SULKING TELL ME WHETHER YOU DON'T THINK YOURSELF RATHER HANDSOME
I'LL TELL YOU I DO
YOU'RE FIT FOR A PRINCE IN DISGUISE
WHO KNOWS BUT
YOUR FATHER WAS EMPEROR OF CHINA AND YOUR MOTHER AN INDIAN QUEEN EACH
OF THEM ABLE TO BUY UP WITH ONE WEEK'S INCOME WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND
THRUSHCROSS GRANGE TOGETHER AND YOU WERE KIDNAPPED BY WICKED SAILORS
AND BROUGHT TO ENGLAND
WERE I IN YOUR PLACE I WOULD FRAME HIGH NOTIONS
OF MY BIRTH AND THE THOUGHTS OF WHAT I WAS SHOULD GIVE ME COURAGE AND
DIGNITY TO SUPPORT THE OPPRESSIONS OF A LITTLE FARMER
SO I CHATTERED ON AND HEATHCLIFF GRADUALLY LOST HIS FROWN AND BEGAN TO
LOOK QUITE PLEASANT WHEN ALL AT ONCE OUR CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED BY
A RUMBLING SOUND MOVING UP THE ROAD AND ENTERING THE COURT
HE RAN TO
THE WINDOW AND I TO THE DOOR JUST IN TIME TO BEHOLD THE TWO LINTONS
DESCEND FROM THE FAMILY CARRIAGE SMOTHERED IN CLOAKS AND FURS AND THE
EARNSHAWS DISMOUNT FROM THEIR HORSES THEY OFTEN RODE TO CHURCH IN
WINTER
CATHERINE TOOK A HAND OF EACH OF THE CHILDREN AND BROUGHT THEM
INTO THE HOUSE AND SET THEM BEFORE THE FIRE WHICH QUICKLY PUT COLOUR
INTO THEIR WHITE FACES
I URGED MY COMPANION TO HASTEN NOW AND SHOW HIS AMIABLE HUMOUR AND HE
WILLINGLY OBEYED BUT ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THAT AS HE OPENED THE DOOR
LEADING FROM THE KITCHEN ON ONE SIDE HINDLEY OPENED IT ON THE OTHER
THEY MET AND THE MASTER IRRITATED AT SEEING HIM CLEAN AND CHEERFUL OR
PERHAPS EAGER TO KEEP HIS PROMISE TO MRS
LINTON SHOVED HIM BACK WITH A
SUDDEN THRUST AND ANGRILY BADE JOSEPH 'KEEP THE FELLOW OUT OF THE
ROOM SEND HIM INTO THE GARRET TILL DINNER IS OVER
HE'LL BE CRAMMING
HIS FINGERS IN THE TARTS AND STEALING THE FRUIT IF LEFT ALONE WITH THEM
A MINUTE
'NAY SIR I COULD NOT AVOID ANSWERING 'HE'LL TOUCH NOTHING NOT HE
AND I SUPPOSE HE MUST HAVE HIS SHARE OF THE DAINTIES AS WELL AS WE
'HE SHALL HAVE HIS SHARE OF MY HAND IF I CATCH HIM DOWNSTAIRS TILL
DARK CRIED HINDLEY
'BEGONE YOU VAGABOND WHAT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING
THE COXCOMB ARE YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF THOSE ELEGANT LOCKS SEE
IF I WON'T PULL THEM A BIT LONGER
'THEY ARE LONG ENOUGH ALREADY OBSERVED MASTER LINTON PEEPING FROM THE
DOORWAY 'I WONDER THEY DON'T MAKE HIS HEAD ACHE
IT'S LIKE A COLT'S
MANE OVER HIS EYES
HE VENTURED THIS REMARK WITHOUT ANY INTENTION TO INSULT BUT HEATHCLIFF'S
VIOLENT NATURE WAS NOT PREPARED TO ENDURE THE APPEARANCE OF IMPERTINENCE
FROM ONE WHOM HE SEEMED TO HATE EVEN THEN AS A RIVAL
HE SEIZED A
TUREEN OF HOT APPLE SAUCE THE FIRST THING THAT CAME UNDER HIS GRIPE AND
DASHED IT FULL AGAINST THE SPEAKER'S FACE AND NECK WHO INSTANTLY
COMMENCED A LAMENT THAT BROUGHT ISABELLA AND CATHERINE HURRYING TO THE
PLACE
MR
EARNSHAW SNATCHED UP THE CULPRIT DIRECTLY AND CONVEYED HIM TO
HIS CHAMBER WHERE DOUBTLESS HE ADMINISTERED A ROUGH REMEDY TO COOL THE
FIT OF PASSION FOR HE APPEARED RED AND BREATHLESS
I GOT THE DISHCLOTH
AND RATHER SPITEFULLY SCRUBBED EDGAR'S NOSE AND MOUTH AFFIRMING IT
SERVED HIM RIGHT FOR MEDDLING
HIS SISTER BEGAN WEEPING TO GO HOME AND
CATHY STOOD BY CONFOUNDED BLUSHING FOR ALL
'YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM SHE EXPOSTULATED WITH MASTER LINTON
'HE WAS IN A BAD TEMPER AND NOW YOU'VE SPOILT YOUR VISIT AND HE'LL BE
FLOGGED I HATE HIM TO BE FLOGGED I CAN'T EAT MY DINNER
WHY DID YOU
SPEAK TO HIM EDGAR
'I DIDN'T SOBBED THE YOUTH ESCAPING FROM MY HANDS AND FINISHING THE
REMAINDER OF THE PURIFICATION WITH HIS CAMBRIC POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
'I
PROMISED MAMMA THAT I WOULDN'T SAY ONE WORD TO HIM AND I DIDN'T
'WELL DON'T CRY REPLIED CATHERINE CONTEMPTUOUSLY 'YOU'RE NOT KILLED
DON'T MAKE MORE MISCHIEF MY BROTHER IS COMING BE QUIET HUSH
ISABELLA HAS ANYBODY HURT YOU
'THERE THERE CHILDREN TO YOUR SEATS CRIED HINDLEY BUSTLING IN
'THAT BRUTE OF A LAD HAS WARMED ME NICELY
NEXT TIME MASTER EDGAR TAKE
THE LAW INTO YOUR OWN FISTS IT WILL GIVE YOU AN APPETITE
THE LITTLE PARTY RECOVERED ITS EQUANIMITY AT SIGHT OF THE FRAGRANT FEAST
THEY WERE HUNGRY AFTER THEIR RIDE AND EASILY CONSOLED SINCE NO REAL
HARM HAD BEFALLEN THEM
MR
EARNSHAW CARVED BOUNTIFUL PLATEFULS AND THE
MISTRESS MADE THEM MERRY WITH LIVELY TALK
I WAITED BEHIND HER CHAIR
AND WAS PAINED TO BEHOLD CATHERINE WITH DRY EYES AND AN INDIFFERENT AIR
COMMENCE CUTTING UP THE WING OF A GOOSE BEFORE HER
'AN UNFEELING
CHILD I THOUGHT TO MYSELF 'HOW LIGHTLY SHE DISMISSES HER OLD
PLAYMATE'S TROUBLES
I COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED HER TO BE SO SELFISH
SHE LIFTED A MOUTHFUL TO HER LIPS THEN SHE SET IT DOWN AGAIN HER CHEEKS
FLUSHED AND THE TEARS GUSHED OVER THEM
SHE SLIPPED HER FORK TO THE
FLOOR AND HASTILY DIVED UNDER THE CLOTH TO CONCEAL HER EMOTION
I DID
NOT CALL HER UNFEELING LONG FOR I PERCEIVED SHE WAS IN PURGATORY
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND WEARYING TO FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING BY
HERSELF OR PAYING A VISIT TO HEATHCLIFF WHO HAD BEEN LOCKED UP BY THE
MASTER AS I DISCOVERED ON ENDEAVOURING TO INTRODUCE TO HIM A PRIVATE
MESS OF VICTUALS
IN THE EVENING WE HAD A DANCE
CATHY BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT BE LIBERATED
THEN AS ISABELLA LINTON HAD NO PARTNER HER ENTREATIES WERE VAIN AND I
WAS APPOINTED TO SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY
WE GOT RID OF ALL GLOOM IN THE
EXCITEMENT OF THE EXERCISE AND OUR PLEASURE WAS INCREASED BY THE ARRIVAL
OF THE GIMMERTON BAND MUSTERING FIFTEEN STRONG A TRUMPET A TROMBONE
CLARIONETS BASSOONS FRENCH HORNS AND A BASS VIOL BESIDES SINGERS
THEY GO THE ROUNDS OF ALL THE RESPECTABLE HOUSES AND RECEIVE
CONTRIBUTIONS EVERY CHRISTMAS AND WE ESTEEMED IT A FIRST RATE TREAT TO
HEAR THEM
AFTER THE USUAL CAROLS HAD BEEN SUNG WE SET THEM TO SONGS
AND GLEES
MRS
EARNSHAW LOVED THE MUSIC AND SO THEY GAVE US PLENTY
CATHERINE LOVED IT TOO BUT SHE SAID IT SOUNDED SWEETEST AT THE TOP OF
THE STEPS AND SHE WENT UP IN THE DARK I FOLLOWED
THEY SHUT THE HOUSE
DOOR BELOW NEVER NOTING OUR ABSENCE IT WAS SO FULL OF PEOPLE
SHE MADE
NO STAY AT THE STAIRS' HEAD BUT MOUNTED FARTHER TO THE GARRET WHERE
HEATHCLIFF WAS CONFINED AND CALLED HIM
HE STUBBORNLY DECLINED
ANSWERING FOR A WHILE SHE PERSEVERED AND FINALLY PERSUADED HIM TO HOLD
COMMUNION WITH HER THROUGH THE BOARDS
I LET THE POOR THINGS CONVERSE
UNMOLESTED TILL I SUPPOSED THE SONGS WERE GOING TO CEASE AND THE
SINGERS TO GET SOME REFRESHMENT THEN I CLAMBERED UP THE LADDER TO WARN
HER
INSTEAD OF FINDING HER OUTSIDE I HEARD HER VOICE WITHIN
THE
LITTLE MONKEY HAD CREPT BY THE SKYLIGHT OF ONE GARRET ALONG THE ROOF
INTO THE SKYLIGHT OF THE OTHER AND IT WAS WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY I
COULD COAX HER OUT AGAIN
WHEN SHE DID COME HEATHCLIFF CAME WITH HER
AND SHE INSISTED THAT I SHOULD TAKE HIM INTO THE KITCHEN AS MY
FELLOW SERVANT HAD GONE TO A NEIGHBOUR'S TO BE REMOVED FROM THE SOUND
OF OUR 'DEVIL'S PSALMODY AS IT PLEASED HIM TO CALL IT
I TOLD THEM I
INTENDED BY NO MEANS TO ENCOURAGE THEIR TRICKS BUT AS THE PRISONER HAD
NEVER BROKEN HIS FAST SINCE YESTERDAY'S DINNER I WOULD WINK AT HIS
CHEATING MR
HINDLEY THAT ONCE
HE WENT DOWN I SET HIM A STOOL BY THE
FIRE AND OFFERED HIM A QUANTITY OF GOOD THINGS BUT HE WAS SICK AND
COULD EAT LITTLE AND MY ATTEMPTS TO ENTERTAIN HIM WERE THROWN AWAY
HE
LEANT HIS TWO ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES AND HIS CHIN ON HIS HANDS AND
REMAINED RAPT IN DUMB MEDITATION
ON MY INQUIRING THE SUBJECT OF HIS
THOUGHTS HE ANSWERED GRAVELY 'I'M TRYING TO SETTLE HOW I SHALL PAY
HINDLEY BACK
I DON'T CARE HOW LONG I WAIT IF I CAN ONLY DO IT AT LAST
I HOPE HE WILL NOT DIE BEFORE I DO
'FOR SHAME HEATHCLIFF SAID I
'IT IS FOR GOD TO PUNISH WICKED PEOPLE
WE SHOULD LEARN TO FORGIVE
'NO GOD WON'T HAVE THE SATISFACTION THAT I SHALL HE RETURNED
'I ONLY
WISH I KNEW THE BEST WAY LET ME ALONE AND I'LL PLAN IT OUT WHILE I'M
THINKING OF THAT I DON'T FEEL PAIN
'BUT MR
LOCKWOOD I FORGET THESE TALES CANNOT DIVERT YOU
I'M ANNOYED
HOW I SHOULD DREAM OF CHATTERING ON AT SUCH A RATE AND YOUR GRUEL COLD
AND YOU NODDING FOR BED I COULD HAVE TOLD HEATHCLIFF'S HISTORY ALL
THAT YOU NEED HEAR IN HALF A DOZEN WORDS
THUS INTERRUPTING HERSELF THE HOUSEKEEPER ROSE AND PROCEEDED TO LAY
ASIDE HER SEWING BUT I FELT INCAPABLE OF MOVING FROM THE HEARTH AND I
WAS VERY FAR FROM NODDING
'SIT STILL MRS
DEAN I CRIED 'DO SIT
STILL ANOTHER HALF HOUR
YOU'VE DONE JUST RIGHT TO TELL THE STORY
LEISURELY
THAT IS THE METHOD I LIKE AND YOU MUST FINISH IT IN THE SAME
STYLE
I AM INTERESTED IN EVERY CHARACTER YOU HAVE MENTIONED MORE OR
LESS
'THE CLOCK IS ON THE STROKE OF ELEVEN SIR
'NO MATTER I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO GO TO BED IN THE LONG HOURS
ONE OR
TWO IS EARLY ENOUGH FOR A PERSON WHO LIES TILL TEN
'YOU SHOULDN'T LIE TILL TEN
THERE'S THE VERY PRIME OF THE MORNING GONE
LONG BEFORE THAT TIME
A PERSON WHO HAS NOT DONE ONE HALF HIS DAY'S WORK
BY TEN O'CLOCK RUNS A CHANCE OF LEAVING THE OTHER HALF UNDONE
'NEVERTHELESS MRS
DEAN RESUME YOUR CHAIR BECAUSE TO MORROW I INTEND
LENGTHENING THE NIGHT TILL AFTERNOON
I PROGNOSTICATE FOR MYSELF AN
OBSTINATE COLD AT LEAST
'I HOPE NOT SIR
WELL YOU MUST ALLOW ME TO LEAP OVER SOME THREE YEARS
DURING THAT SPACE MRS
EARNSHAW
'NO NO I'LL ALLOW NOTHING OF THE SORT ARE YOU ACQUAINTED WITH THE
MOOD OF MIND IN WHICH IF YOU WERE SEATED ALONE AND THE CAT LICKING ITS
KITTEN ON THE RUG BEFORE YOU YOU WOULD WATCH THE OPERATION SO INTENTLY
THAT PUSS'S NEGLECT OF ONE EAR WOULD PUT YOU SERIOUSLY OUT OF TEMPER
'A TERRIBLY LAZY MOOD I SHOULD SAY
'ON THE CONTRARY A TIRESOMELY ACTIVE ONE
IT IS MINE AT PRESENT AND
THEREFORE CONTINUE MINUTELY
I PERCEIVE THAT PEOPLE IN THESE REGIONS
ACQUIRE OVER PEOPLE IN TOWNS THE VALUE THAT A SPIDER IN A DUNGEON DOES
OVER A SPIDER IN A COTTAGE TO THEIR VARIOUS OCCUPANTS AND YET THE
DEEPENED ATTRACTION IS NOT ENTIRELY OWING TO THE SITUATION OF THE
LOOKER ON
THEY DO LIVE MORE IN EARNEST MORE IN THEMSELVES AND LESS
IN SURFACE CHANGE AND FRIVOLOUS EXTERNAL THINGS
I COULD FANCY A LOVE
FOR LIFE HERE ALMOST POSSIBLE AND I WAS A FIXED UNBELIEVER IN ANY LOVE
OF A YEAR'S STANDING
ONE STATE RESEMBLES SETTING A HUNGRY MAN DOWN TO A
SINGLE DISH ON WHICH HE MAY CONCENTRATE HIS ENTIRE APPETITE AND DO IT
JUSTICE THE OTHER INTRODUCING HIM TO A TABLE LAID OUT BY FRENCH COOKS
HE CAN PERHAPS EXTRACT AS MUCH ENJOYMENT FROM THE WHOLE BUT EACH PART
IS A MERE ATOM IN HIS REGARD AND REMEMBRANCE
'OH HERE WE ARE THE SAME AS ANYWHERE ELSE WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW US
OBSERVED MRS
DEAN SOMEWHAT PUZZLED AT MY SPEECH
'EXCUSE ME I RESPONDED 'YOU MY GOOD FRIEND ARE A STRIKING EVIDENCE
AGAINST THAT ASSERTION
EXCEPTING A FEW PROVINCIALISMS OF SLIGHT
CONSEQUENCE YOU HAVE NO MARKS OF THE MANNERS WHICH I AM HABITUATED TO
CONSIDER AS PECULIAR TO YOUR CLASS
I AM SURE YOU HAVE THOUGHT A GREAT
DEAL MORE THAN THE GENERALITY OF SERVANTS THINK
YOU HAVE BEEN COMPELLED
TO CULTIVATE YOUR REFLECTIVE FACULTIES FOR WANT OF OCCASIONS FOR
FRITTERING YOUR LIFE AWAY IN SILLY TRIFLES
MRS
DEAN LAUGHED
'I CERTAINLY ESTEEM MYSELF A STEADY REASONABLE KIND OF BODY SHE SAID
'NOT EXACTLY FROM LIVING AMONG THE HILLS AND SEEING ONE SET OF FACES AND
ONE SERIES OF ACTIONS FROM YEAR'S END TO YEAR'S END BUT I HAVE
UNDERGONE SHARP DISCIPLINE WHICH HAS TAUGHT ME WISDOM AND THEN I HAVE
READ MORE THAN YOU WOULD FANCY MR
LOCKWOOD
YOU COULD NOT OPEN A BOOK
IN THIS LIBRARY THAT I HAVE NOT LOOKED INTO AND GOT SOMETHING OUT OF
ALSO UNLESS IT BE THAT RANGE OF GREEK AND LATIN AND THAT OF FRENCH AND
THOSE I KNOW ONE FROM ANOTHER IT IS AS MUCH AS YOU CAN EXPECT OF A POOR
MAN'S DAUGHTER
HOWEVER IF I AM TO FOLLOW MY STORY IN TRUE GOSSIP'S
FASHION I HAD BETTER GO ON AND INSTEAD OF LEAPING THREE YEARS I WILL
BE CONTENT TO PASS TO THE NEXT SUMMER THE SUMMER OF 1778 THAT IS NEARLY
TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO
CHAPTER VIII
ON THE MORNING OF A FINE JUNE DAY MY FIRST BONNY LITTLE NURSLING AND THE
LAST OF THE ANCIENT EARNSHAW STOCK WAS BORN
WE WERE BUSY WITH THE HAY
IN A FAR AWAY FIELD WHEN THE GIRL THAT USUALLY BROUGHT OUR BREAKFASTS
CAME RUNNING AN HOUR TOO SOON ACROSS THE MEADOW AND UP THE LANE CALLING
ME AS SHE RAN
'OH SUCH A GRAND BAIRN SHE PANTED OUT
'THE FINEST LAD THAT EVER
BREATHED BUT THE DOCTOR SAYS MISSIS MUST GO HE SAYS SHE'S BEEN IN A
CONSUMPTION THESE MANY MONTHS
I HEARD HIM TELL MR
HINDLEY AND NOW SHE
HAS NOTHING TO KEEP HER AND SHE'LL BE DEAD BEFORE WINTER
YOU MUST COME
HOME DIRECTLY
YOU'RE TO NURSE IT NELLY TO FEED IT WITH SUGAR AND
MILK AND TAKE CARE OF IT DAY AND NIGHT
I WISH I WERE YOU BECAUSE IT
WILL BE ALL YOURS WHEN THERE IS NO MISSIS
'BUT IS SHE VERY ILL I ASKED FLINGING DOWN MY RAKE AND TYING MY
BONNET
'I GUESS SHE IS YET SHE LOOKS BRAVELY REPLIED THE GIRL 'AND SHE TALKS
AS IF SHE THOUGHT OF LIVING TO SEE IT GROW A MAN
SHE'S OUT OF HER HEAD
FOR JOY IT'S SUCH A BEAUTY IF I WERE HER I'M CERTAIN I SHOULD NOT DIE
I SHOULD GET BETTER AT THE BARE SIGHT OF IT IN SPITE OF KENNETH
I WAS
FAIRLY MAD AT HIM
DAME ARCHER BROUGHT THE CHERUB DOWN TO MASTER IN THE
HOUSE AND HIS FACE JUST BEGAN TO LIGHT UP WHEN THE OLD CROAKER STEPS
FORWARD AND SAYS HE EARNSHAW IT'S A BLESSING YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN
SPARED TO LEAVE YOU THIS SON
WHEN SHE CAME I FELT CONVINCED WE
SHOULDN'T KEEP HER LONG AND NOW I MUST TELL YOU THE WINTER WILL
PROBABLY FINISH HER
DON'T TAKE ON AND FRET ABOUT IT TOO MUCH IT CAN'T
BE HELPED
AND BESIDES YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO CHOOSE SUCH
A RUSH OF A LASS
'AND WHAT DID THE MASTER ANSWER I INQUIRED
'I THINK HE SWORE BUT I DIDN'T MIND HIM I WAS STRAINING TO SEE THE
BAIRN AND SHE BEGAN AGAIN TO DESCRIBE IT RAPTUROUSLY
I AS ZEALOUS AS
HERSELF HURRIED EAGERLY HOME TO ADMIRE ON MY PART THOUGH I WAS VERY
SAD FOR HINDLEY'S SAKE
HE HAD ROOM IN HIS HEART ONLY FOR TWO IDOLS HIS
WIFE AND HIMSELF HE DOTED ON BOTH AND ADORED ONE AND I COULDN'T
CONCEIVE HOW HE WOULD BEAR THE LOSS
WHEN WE GOT TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS THERE HE STOOD AT THE FRONT DOOR AND
AS I PASSED IN I ASKED 'HOW WAS THE BABY
'NEARLY READY TO RUN ABOUT NELL HE REPLIED PUTTING ON A CHEERFUL
SMILE
'AND THE MISTRESS I VENTURED TO INQUIRE 'THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE'S
'DAMN THE DOCTOR HE INTERRUPTED REDDENING
'FRANCES IS QUITE RIGHT
SHE'LL BE PERFECTLY WELL BY THIS TIME NEXT WEEK
ARE YOU GOING
UP STAIRS WILL YOU TELL HER THAT I'LL COME IF SHE'LL PROMISE NOT TO
TALK
I LEFT HER BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT HOLD HER TONGUE AND SHE
MUST TELL HER MR
KENNETH SAYS SHE MUST BE QUIET
I DELIVERED THIS MESSAGE TO MRS
EARNSHAW SHE SEEMED IN FLIGHTY SPIRITS
AND REPLIED MERRILY 'I HARDLY SPOKE A WORD ELLEN AND THERE HE HAS GONE
OUT TWICE CRYING
WELL SAY I PROMISE I WON'T SPEAK BUT THAT DOES NOT
BIND ME NOT TO LAUGH AT HIM
POOR SOUL TILL WITHIN A WEEK OF HER DEATH THAT GAY HEART NEVER FAILED
HER AND HER HUSBAND PERSISTED DOGGEDLY NAY FURIOUSLY IN AFFIRMING HER
HEALTH IMPROVED EVERY DAY
WHEN KENNETH WARNED HIM THAT HIS MEDICINES
WERE USELESS AT THAT STAGE OF THE MALADY AND HE NEEDN'T PUT HIM TO
FURTHER EXPENSE BY ATTENDING HER HE RETORTED 'I KNOW YOU NEED NOT SHE'S
WELL SHE DOES NOT WANT ANY MORE ATTENDANCE FROM YOU SHE NEVER WAS IN A
CONSUMPTION
IT WAS A FEVER AND IT IS GONE HER PULSE IS AS SLOW AS
MINE NOW AND HER CHEEK AS COOL
HE TOLD HIS WIFE THE SAME STORY AND SHE SEEMED TO BELIEVE HIM BUT ONE
NIGHT WHILE LEANING ON HIS SHOULDER IN THE ACT OF SAYING SHE THOUGHT
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET UP TO MORROW A FIT OF COUGHING TOOK HER A
VERY SLIGHT ONE HE RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS SHE PUT HER TWO HANDS ABOUT
HIS NECK HER FACE CHANGED AND SHE WAS DEAD
AS THE GIRL HAD ANTICIPATED THE CHILD HARETON FELL WHOLLY INTO MY HANDS
MR
EARNSHAW PROVIDED HE SAW HIM HEALTHY AND NEVER HEARD HIM CRY WAS
CONTENTED AS FAR AS REGARDED HIM
FOR HIMSELF HE GREW DESPERATE HIS
SORROW WAS OF THAT KIND THAT WILL NOT LAMENT
HE NEITHER WEPT NOR
PRAYED HE CURSED AND DEFIED EXECRATED GOD AND MAN AND GAVE HIMSELF UP
TO RECKLESS DISSIPATION
THE SERVANTS COULD NOT BEAR HIS TYRANNICAL AND
EVIL CONDUCT LONG JOSEPH AND I WERE THE ONLY TWO THAT WOULD STAY
I HAD
NOT THE HEART TO LEAVE MY CHARGE AND BESIDES YOU KNOW I HAD BEEN HIS
FOSTER SISTER AND EXCUSED HIS BEHAVIOUR MORE READILY THAN A STRANGER
WOULD
JOSEPH REMAINED TO HECTOR OVER TENANTS AND LABOURERS AND BECAUSE
IT WAS HIS VOCATION TO BE WHERE HE HAD PLENTY OF WICKEDNESS TO REPROVE
THE MASTER'S BAD WAYS AND BAD COMPANIONS FORMED A PRETTY EXAMPLE FOR
CATHERINE AND HEATHCLIFF
HIS TREATMENT OF THE LATTER WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE
A FIEND OF A SAINT
AND TRULY IT APPEARED AS IF THE LAD WERE
POSSESSED OF SOMETHING DIABOLICAL AT THAT PERIOD
HE DELIGHTED TO
WITNESS HINDLEY DEGRADING HIMSELF PAST REDEMPTION AND BECAME DAILY MORE
NOTABLE FOR SAVAGE SULLENNESS AND FEROCITY
I COULD NOT HALF TELL WHAT
AN INFERNAL HOUSE WE HAD
THE CURATE DROPPED CALLING AND NOBODY DECENT
CAME NEAR US AT LAST UNLESS EDGAR LINTON'S VISITS TO MISS CATHY MIGHT
BE AN EXCEPTION
AT FIFTEEN SHE WAS THE QUEEN OF THE COUNTRY SIDE SHE
HAD NO PEER AND SHE DID TURN OUT A HAUGHTY HEADSTRONG CREATURE I OWN
I DID NOT LIKE HER AFTER INFANCY WAS PAST AND I VEXED HER FREQUENTLY BY
TRYING TO BRING DOWN HER ARROGANCE SHE NEVER TOOK AN AVERSION TO ME
THOUGH
SHE HAD A WONDROUS CONSTANCY TO OLD ATTACHMENTS EVEN HEATHCLIFF
KEPT HIS HOLD ON HER AFFECTIONS UNALTERABLY AND YOUNG LINTON WITH ALL
HIS SUPERIORITY FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE AN EQUALLY DEEP IMPRESSION
HE WAS MY LATE MASTER THAT IS HIS PORTRAIT OVER THE FIREPLACE
IT USED
TO HANG ON ONE SIDE AND HIS WIFE'S ON THE OTHER BUT HERS HAS BEEN
REMOVED OR ELSE YOU MIGHT SEE SOMETHING OF WHAT SHE WAS
CAN YOU MAKE
THAT OUT
MRS
DEAN RAISED THE CANDLE AND I DISCERNED A SOFT FEATURED FACE
EXCEEDINGLY RESEMBLING THE YOUNG LADY AT THE HEIGHTS BUT MORE PENSIVE
AND AMIABLE IN EXPRESSION
IT FORMED A SWEET PICTURE
THE LONG LIGHT
HAIR CURLED SLIGHTLY ON THE TEMPLES THE EYES WERE LARGE AND SERIOUS THE
FIGURE ALMOST TOO GRACEFUL
I DID NOT MARVEL HOW CATHERINE EARNSHAW
COULD FORGET HER FIRST FRIEND FOR SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL
I MARVELLED MUCH
HOW HE WITH A MIND TO CORRESPOND WITH HIS PERSON COULD FANCY MY IDEA OF
CATHERINE EARNSHAW
'A VERY AGREEABLE PORTRAIT I OBSERVED TO THE HOUSE KEEPER
'IS IT
LIKE
'YES SHE ANSWERED 'BUT HE LOOKED BETTER WHEN HE WAS ANIMATED THAT IS
HIS EVERYDAY COUNTENANCE HE WANTED SPIRIT IN GENERAL
CATHERINE HAD KEPT UP HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LINTONS SINCE HER
FIVE WEEKS' RESIDENCE AMONG THEM AND AS SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION TO SHOW
HER ROUGH SIDE IN THEIR COMPANY AND HAD THE SENSE TO BE ASHAMED OF
BEING RUDE WHERE SHE EXPERIENCED SUCH INVARIABLE COURTESY SHE IMPOSED
UNWITTINGLY ON THE OLD LADY AND GENTLEMAN BY HER INGENIOUS CORDIALITY
GAINED THE ADMIRATION OF ISABELLA AND THE HEART AND SOUL OF HER
BROTHER ACQUISITIONS THAT FLATTERED HER FROM THE FIRST FOR SHE WAS
FULL OF AMBITION AND LED HER TO ADOPT A DOUBLE CHARACTER WITHOUT
EXACTLY INTENDING TO DECEIVE ANY ONE
IN THE PLACE WHERE SHE HEARD
HEATHCLIFF TERMED A 'VULGAR YOUNG RUFFIAN AND 'WORSE THAN A BRUTE
SHE TOOK CARE NOT TO ACT LIKE HIM BUT AT HOME SHE HAD SMALL INCLINATION
TO PRACTISE POLITENESS THAT WOULD ONLY BE LAUGHED AT AND RESTRAIN AN
UNRULY NATURE WHEN IT WOULD BRING HER NEITHER CREDIT NOR PRAISE
MR
EDGAR SELDOM MUSTERED COURAGE TO VISIT WUTHERING HEIGHTS OPENLY
HE
HAD A TERROR OF EARNSHAW'S REPUTATION AND SHRUNK FROM ENCOUNTERING HIM
AND YET HE WAS ALWAYS RECEIVED WITH OUR BEST ATTEMPTS AT CIVILITY THE
MASTER HIMSELF AVOIDED OFFENDING HIM KNOWING WHY HE CAME AND IF HE
COULD NOT BE GRACIOUS KEPT OUT OF THE WAY
I RATHER THINK HIS
APPEARANCE THERE WAS DISTASTEFUL TO CATHERINE SHE WAS NOT ARTFUL NEVER
PLAYED THE COQUETTE AND HAD EVIDENTLY AN OBJECTION TO HER TWO FRIENDS
MEETING AT ALL FOR WHEN HEATHCLIFF EXPRESSED CONTEMPT OF LINTON IN HIS
PRESENCE SHE COULD NOT HALF COINCIDE AS SHE DID IN HIS ABSENCE AND
WHEN LINTON EVINCED DISGUST AND ANTIPATHY TO HEATHCLIFF SHE DARED NOT
TREAT HIS SENTIMENTS WITH INDIFFERENCE AS IF DEPRECIATION OF HER
PLAYMATE WERE OF SCARCELY ANY CONSEQUENCE TO HER
I'VE HAD MANY A LAUGH
AT HER PERPLEXITIES AND UNTOLD TROUBLES WHICH SHE VAINLY STROVE TO HIDE
FROM MY MOCKERY
THAT SOUNDS ILL NATURED BUT SHE WAS SO PROUD IT BECAME
REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PITY HER DISTRESSES TILL SHE SHOULD BE CHASTENED
INTO MORE HUMILITY
SHE DID BRING HERSELF FINALLY TO CONFESS AND TO
CONFIDE IN ME THERE WAS NOT A SOUL ELSE THAT SHE MIGHT FASHION INTO AN
ADVISER
MR
HINDLEY HAD GONE FROM HOME ONE AFTERNOON AND HEATHCLIFF PRESUMED TO
GIVE HIMSELF A HOLIDAY ON THE STRENGTH OF IT
HE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF
SIXTEEN THEN I THINK AND WITHOUT HAVING BAD FEATURES OR BEING
DEFICIENT IN INTELLECT HE CONTRIVED TO CONVEY AN IMPRESSION OF INWARD
AND OUTWARD REPULSIVENESS THAT HIS PRESENT ASPECT RETAINS NO TRACES OF
IN THE FIRST PLACE HE HAD BY THAT TIME LOST THE BENEFIT OF HIS EARLY
EDUCATION CONTINUAL HARD WORK BEGUN SOON AND CONCLUDED LATE HAD
EXTINGUISHED ANY CURIOSITY HE ONCE POSSESSED IN PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE AND
ANY LOVE FOR BOOKS OR LEARNING
HIS CHILDHOOD'S SENSE OF SUPERIORITY
INSTILLED INTO HIM BY THE FAVOURS OF OLD MR
EARNSHAW WAS FADED AWAY
HE
STRUGGLED LONG TO KEEP UP AN EQUALITY WITH CATHERINE IN HER STUDIES AND
YIELDED WITH POIGNANT THOUGH SILENT REGRET BUT HE YIELDED COMPLETELY
AND THERE WAS NO PREVAILING ON HIM TO TAKE A STEP IN THE WAY OF MOVING
UPWARD WHEN HE FOUND HE MUST NECESSARILY SINK BENEATH HIS FORMER
LEVEL
THEN PERSONAL APPEARANCE SYMPATHISED WITH MENTAL DETERIORATION
HE ACQUIRED A SLOUCHING GAIT AND IGNOBLE LOOK HIS NATURALLY RESERVED
DISPOSITION WAS EXAGGERATED INTO AN ALMOST IDIOTIC EXCESS OF UNSOCIABLE
MOROSENESS AND HE TOOK A GRIM PLEASURE APPARENTLY IN EXCITING THE
AVERSION RATHER THAN THE ESTEEM OF HIS FEW ACQUAINTANCES
CATHERINE AND HE WERE CONSTANT COMPANIONS STILL AT HIS SEASONS OF RESPITE
FROM LABOUR BUT HE HAD CEASED TO EXPRESS HIS FONDNESS FOR HER IN WORDS
AND RECOILED WITH ANGRY SUSPICION FROM HER GIRLISH CARESSES AS IF
CONSCIOUS THERE COULD BE NO GRATIFICATION IN LAVISHING SUCH MARKS OF
AFFECTION ON HIM
ON THE BEFORE NAMED OCCASION HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE TO
ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION OF DOING NOTHING WHILE I WAS ASSISTING MISS CATHY
TO ARRANGE HER DRESS SHE HAD NOT RECKONED ON HIS TAKING IT INTO HIS HEAD
TO BE IDLE AND IMAGINING SHE WOULD HAVE THE WHOLE PLACE TO HERSELF SHE
MANAGED BY SOME MEANS TO INFORM MR
EDGAR OF HER BROTHER'S ABSENCE AND
WAS THEN PREPARING TO RECEIVE HIM
'CATHY ARE YOU BUSY THIS AFTERNOON ASKED HEATHCLIFF
'ARE YOU GOING
ANYWHERE
'NO IT IS RAINING SHE ANSWERED
'WHY HAVE YOU THAT SILK FROCK ON THEN HE SAID
'NOBODY COMING HERE I
HOPE
'NOT THAT I KNOW OF STAMMERED MISS 'BUT YOU SHOULD BE IN THE FIELD
NOW HEATHCLIFF
IT IS AN HOUR PAST DINNERTIME I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONE
'HINDLEY DOES NOT OFTEN FREE US FROM HIS ACCURSED PRESENCE OBSERVED THE
BOY
'I'LL NOT WORK ANY MORE TO DAY I'LL STAY WITH YOU
'OH BUT JOSEPH WILL TELL SHE SUGGESTED 'YOU'D BETTER GO
'JOSEPH IS LOADING LIME ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF PENISTONE CRAGS IT WILL
TAKE HIM TILL DARK AND HE'LL NEVER KNOW
SO SAYING HE LOUNGED TO THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN
CATHERINE REFLECTED AN
INSTANT WITH KNITTED BROWS SHE FOUND IT NEEDFUL TO SMOOTH THE WAY FOR
AN INTRUSION
'ISABELLA AND EDGAR LINTON TALKED OF CALLING THIS
AFTERNOON SHE SAID AT THE CONCLUSION OF A MINUTE'S SILENCE
'AS IT
RAINS I HARDLY EXPECT THEM BUT THEY MAY COME AND IF THEY DO YOU RUN
THE RISK OF BEING SCOLDED FOR NO GOOD
'ORDER ELLEN TO SAY YOU ARE ENGAGED CATHY HE PERSISTED 'DON'T TURN ME
OUT FOR THOSE PITIFUL SILLY FRIENDS OF YOURS I'M ON THE POINT
SOMETIMES OF COMPLAINING THAT THEY BUT I'LL NOT
'THAT THEY WHAT CRIED CATHERINE GAZING AT HIM WITH A TROUBLED
COUNTENANCE
'OH NELLY SHE ADDED PETULANTLY JERKING HER HEAD AWAY
FROM MY HANDS 'YOU'VE COMBED MY HAIR QUITE OUT OF CURL THAT'S ENOUGH
LET ME ALONE
WHAT ARE YOU ON THE POINT OF COMPLAINING ABOUT
HEATHCLIFF
'NOTHING ONLY LOOK AT THE ALMANACK ON THAT WALL HE POINTED TO A FRAMED
SHEET HANGING NEAR THE WINDOW AND CONTINUED 'THE CROSSES ARE FOR THE
EVENINGS YOU HAVE SPENT WITH THE LINTONS THE DOTS FOR THOSE SPENT WITH
ME
DO YOU SEE I'VE MARKED EVERY DAY
'YES VERY FOOLISH AS IF I TOOK NOTICE REPLIED CATHERINE IN A PEEVISH
TONE
'AND WHERE IS THE SENSE OF THAT
'TO SHOW THAT I DO TAKE NOTICE SAID HEATHCLIFF
'AND SHOULD I ALWAYS BE SITTING WITH YOU SHE DEMANDED GROWING MORE
IRRITATED
'WHAT GOOD DO I GET WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT YOU MIGHT BE
DUMB OR A BABY FOR ANYTHING YOU SAY TO AMUSE ME OR FOR ANYTHING YOU
DO EITHER
'YOU NEVER TOLD ME BEFORE THAT I TALKED TOO LITTLE OR THAT YOU DISLIKED
MY COMPANY CATHY EXCLAIMED HEATHCLIFF IN MUCH AGITATION
'IT'S NO COMPANY AT ALL WHEN PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING AND SAY NOTHING SHE
MUTTERED
HER COMPANION ROSE UP BUT HE HADN'T TIME TO EXPRESS HIS FEELINGS
FURTHER FOR A HORSE'S FEET WERE HEARD ON THE FLAGS AND HAVING KNOCKED
GENTLY YOUNG LINTON ENTERED HIS FACE BRILLIANT WITH DELIGHT AT THE
UNEXPECTED SUMMON SHE HAD RECEIVED
DOUBTLESS CATHERINE MARKED THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HER FRIENDS AS ONE CAME IN AND THE OTHER WENT OUT
THE CONTRAST RESEMBLED WHAT YOU SEE IN EXCHANGING A BLEAK HILLY COAL
COUNTRY FOR A BEAUTIFUL FERTILE VALLEY AND HIS VOICE AND GREETING WERE
AS OPPOSITE AS HIS ASPECT
HE HAD A SWEET LOW MANNER OF SPEAKING AND
PRONOUNCED HIS WORDS AS YOU DO THAT'S LESS GRUFF THAN WE TALK HERE AND
SOFTER
'I'M NOT COME TOO SOON AM I HE SAID CASTING A LOOK AT ME I HAD BEGUN
TO WIPE THE PLATE AND TIDY SOME DRAWERS AT THE FAR END IN THE DRESSER
'NO ANSWERED CATHERINE
'WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE NELLY
'MY WORK MISS I REPLIED
MR
HINDLEY HAD GIVEN ME DIRECTIONS TO MAKE
A THIRD PARTY IN ANY PRIVATE VISITS LINTON CHOSE TO PAY
SHE STEPPED BEHIND ME AND WHISPERED CROSSLY 'TAKE YOURSELF AND YOUR
DUSTERS OFF WHEN COMPANY ARE IN THE HOUSE SERVANTS DON'T COMMENCE
SCOURING AND CLEANING IN THE ROOM WHERE THEY ARE
'IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY NOW THAT MASTER IS AWAY I ANSWERED ALOUD 'HE
HATES ME TO BE FIDGETING OVER THESE THINGS IN HIS PRESENCE
I'M SURE MR
EDGAR WILL EXCUSE ME
'I HATE YOU TO BE FIDGETING IN MY PRESENCE EXCLAIMED THE YOUNG LADY
IMPERIOUSLY NOT ALLOWING HER GUEST TIME TO SPEAK SHE HAD FAILED TO
RECOVER HER EQUANIMITY SINCE THE LITTLE DISPUTE WITH HEATHCLIFF
'I'M SORRY FOR IT MISS CATHERINE WAS MY RESPONSE AND I PROCEEDED
ASSIDUOUSLY WITH MY OCCUPATION
SHE SUPPOSING EDGAR COULD NOT SEE HER SNATCHED THE CLOTH FROM MY HAND
AND PINCHED ME WITH A PROLONGED WRENCH VERY SPITEFULLY ON THE ARM
I'VE
SAID I DID NOT LOVE HER AND RATHER RELISHED MORTIFYING HER VANITY NOW
AND THEN BESIDES SHE HURT ME EXTREMELY SO I STARTED UP FROM MY KNEES
AND SCREAMED OUT 'OH MISS THAT'S A NASTY TRICK YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO
NIP ME AND I'M NOT GOING TO BEAR IT
'I DIDN'T TOUCH YOU YOU LYING CREATURE CRIED SHE HER FINGERS TINGLING
TO REPEAT THE ACT AND HER EARS RED WITH RAGE
SHE NEVER HAD POWER TO
CONCEAL HER PASSION IT ALWAYS SET HER WHOLE COMPLEXION IN A BLAZE
'WHAT'S THAT THEN I RETORTED SHOWING A DECIDED PURPLE WITNESS TO
REFUTE HER
SHE STAMPED HER FOOT WAVERED A MOMENT AND THEN IRRESISTIBLY IMPELLED
BY THE NAUGHTY SPIRIT WITHIN HER SLAPPED ME ON THE CHEEK A STINGING
BLOW THAT FILLED BOTH EYES WITH WATER
'CATHERINE LOVE CATHERINE INTERPOSED LINTON GREATLY SHOCKED AT THE
DOUBLE FAULT OF FALSEHOOD AND VIOLENCE WHICH HIS IDOL HAD COMMITTED
'LEAVE THE ROOM ELLEN SHE REPEATED TREMBLING ALL OVER
LITTLE HARETON WHO FOLLOWED ME EVERYWHERE AND WAS SITTING NEAR ME ON
THE FLOOR AT SEEING MY TEARS COMMENCED CRYING HIMSELF AND SOBBED OUT
COMPLAINTS AGAINST 'WICKED AUNT CATHY WHICH DREW HER FURY ON TO HIS
UNLUCKY HEAD SHE SEIZED HIS SHOULDERS AND SHOOK HIM TILL THE POOR CHILD
WAXED LIVID AND EDGAR THOUGHTLESSLY LAID HOLD OF HER HANDS TO DELIVER
HIM
IN AN INSTANT ONE WAS WRUNG FREE AND THE ASTONISHED YOUNG MAN FELT
IT APPLIED OVER HIS OWN EAR IN A WAY THAT COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR JEST
HE DREW BACK IN CONSTERNATION
I LIFTED HARETON IN MY ARMS AND WALKED
OFF TO THE KITCHEN WITH HIM LEAVING THE DOOR OF COMMUNICATION OPEN FOR
I WAS CURIOUS TO WATCH HOW THEY WOULD SETTLE THEIR DISAGREEMENT
THE
INSULTED VISITOR MOVED TO THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD LAID HIS HAT PALE AND
WITH A QUIVERING LIP
'THAT'S RIGHT I SAID TO MYSELF
'TAKE WARNING AND BEGONE IT'S A
KINDNESS TO LET YOU HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HER GENUINE DISPOSITION
'WHERE ARE YOU GOING DEMANDED CATHERINE ADVANCING TO THE DOOR
HE SWERVED ASIDE AND ATTEMPTED TO PASS
'YOU MUST NOT GO SHE EXCLAIMED ENERGETICALLY
'I MUST AND SHALL HE REPLIED IN A SUBDUED VOICE
'NO SHE PERSISTED GRASPING THE HANDLE 'NOT YET EDGAR LINTON SIT
DOWN YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE ME IN THAT TEMPER
I SHOULD BE MISERABLE ALL
NIGHT AND I WON'T BE MISERABLE FOR YOU
'CAN I STAY AFTER YOU HAVE STRUCK ME ASKED LINTON
CATHERINE WAS MUTE
'YOU'VE MADE ME AFRAID AND ASHAMED OF YOU HE CONTINUED 'I'LL NOT COME
HERE AGAIN
HER EYES BEGAN TO GLISTEN AND HER LIDS TO TWINKLE
'AND YOU TOLD A DELIBERATE UNTRUTH HE SAID
'I DIDN'T SHE CRIED RECOVERING HER SPEECH 'I DID NOTHING
DELIBERATELY
WELL GO IF YOU PLEASE GET AWAY AND NOW I'LL CRY I'LL
CRY MYSELF SICK
SHE DROPPED DOWN ON HER KNEES BY A CHAIR AND SET TO WEEPING IN SERIOUS
EARNEST
EDGAR PERSEVERED IN HIS RESOLUTION AS FAR AS THE COURT THERE
HE LINGERED
I RESOLVED TO ENCOURAGE HIM
'MISS IS DREADFULLY WAYWARD SIR I CALLED OUT
'AS BAD AS ANY MARRED
CHILD YOU'D BETTER BE RIDING HOME OR ELSE SHE WILL BE SICK ONLY TO
GRIEVE US
THE SOFT THING LOOKED ASKANCE THROUGH THE WINDOW HE POSSESSED THE POWER
TO DEPART AS MUCH AS A CAT POSSESSES THE POWER TO LEAVE A MOUSE HALF
KILLED OR A BIRD HALF EATEN
AH I THOUGHT THERE WILL BE NO SAVING
HIM HE'S DOOMED AND FLIES TO HIS FATE AND SO IT WAS HE TURNED
ABRUPTLY HASTENED INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND HIM AND
WHEN I WENT IN A WHILE AFTER TO INFORM THEM THAT EARNSHAW HAD COME HOME
RABID DRUNK READY TO PULL THE WHOLE PLACE ABOUT OUR EARS HIS ORDINARY
FRAME OF MIND IN THAT CONDITION I SAW THE QUARREL HAD MERELY EFFECTED A
CLOSER INTIMACY HAD BROKEN THE OUTWORKS OF YOUTHFUL TIMIDITY AND
ENABLED THEM TO FORSAKE THE DISGUISE OF FRIENDSHIP AND CONFESS
THEMSELVES LOVERS
INTELLIGENCE OF MR
HINDLEY'S ARRIVAL DROVE LINTON SPEEDILY TO HIS HORSE
AND CATHERINE TO HER CHAMBER
I WENT TO HIDE LITTLE HARETON AND TO TAKE
THE SHOT OUT OF THE MASTER'S FOWLING PIECE WHICH HE WAS FOND OF PLAYING
WITH IN HIS INSANE EXCITEMENT TO THE HAZARD OF THE LIVES OF ANY WHO
PROVOKED OR EVEN ATTRACTED HIS NOTICE TOO MUCH AND I HAD HIT UPON THE
PLAN OF REMOVING IT THAT HE MIGHT DO LESS MISCHIEF IF HE DID GO THE
LENGTH OF FIRING THE GUN
CHAPTER IX
HE ENTERED VOCIFERATING OATHS DREADFUL TO HEAR AND CAUGHT ME IN THE ACT
OF STOWING HIS SON AWAY IN THE KITCHEN CUPBOARD
HARETON WAS IMPRESSED
WITH A WHOLESOME TERROR OF ENCOUNTERING EITHER HIS WILD BEAST'S FONDNESS
OR HIS MADMAN'S RAGE FOR IN ONE HE RAN A CHANCE OF BEING SQUEEZED AND
KISSED TO DEATH AND IN THE OTHER OF BEING FLUNG INTO THE FIRE OR DASHED
AGAINST THE WALL AND THE POOR THING REMAINED PERFECTLY QUIET WHEREVER I
CHOSE TO PUT HIM
'THERE I'VE FOUND IT OUT AT LAST CRIED HINDLEY PULLING ME BACK BY THE
SKIN OF MY NECK LIKE A DOG
'BY HEAVEN AND HELL YOU'VE SWORN BETWEEN
YOU TO MURDER THAT CHILD I KNOW HOW IT IS NOW THAT HE IS ALWAYS OUT
OF MY WAY
BUT WITH THE HELP OF SATAN I SHALL MAKE YOU SWALLOW THE
CARVING KNIFE NELLY YOU NEEDN'T LAUGH FOR I'VE JUST CRAMMED KENNETH
HEAD DOWNMOST IN THE BLACK HORSE MARSH AND TWO IS THE SAME AS ONE AND
I WANT TO KILL SOME OF YOU I SHALL HAVE NO REST TILL I DO
'BUT I DON'T LIKE THE CARVING KNIFE MR
HINDLEY I ANSWERED 'IT HAS
BEEN CUTTING RED HERRINGS
I'D RATHER BE SHOT IF YOU PLEASE
'YOU'D RATHER BE DAMNED HE SAID 'AND SO YOU SHALL
NO LAW IN ENGLAND
CAN HINDER A MAN FROM KEEPING HIS HOUSE DECENT AND MINE'S ABOMINABLE
OPEN YOUR MOUTH HE HELD THE KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND PUSHED ITS POINT
BETWEEN MY TEETH BUT FOR MY PART I WAS NEVER MUCH AFRAID OF HIS
VAGARIES
I SPAT OUT AND AFFIRMED IT TASTED DETESTABLY I WOULD NOT
TAKE IT ON ANY ACCOUNT
'OH SAID HE RELEASING ME 'I SEE THAT HIDEOUS LITTLE VILLAIN IS NOT
HARETON I BEG YOUR PARDON NELL
IF IT BE HE DESERVES FLAYING ALIVE
FOR NOT RUNNING TO WELCOME ME AND FOR SCREAMING AS IF I WERE A GOBLIN
UNNATURAL CUB COME HITHER I'LL TEACH THEE TO IMPOSE ON A GOOD HEARTED
DELUDED FATHER
NOW DON'T YOU THINK THE LAD WOULD BE HANDSOMER CROPPED
IT MAKES A DOG FIERCER AND I LOVE SOMETHING FIERCE GET ME A
SCISSORS SOMETHING FIERCE AND TRIM BESIDES IT'S INFERNAL
AFFECTATION DEVILISH CONCEIT IT IS TO CHERISH OUR EARS WE'RE ASSES
ENOUGH WITHOUT THEM
HUSH CHILD HUSH WELL THEN IT IS MY DARLING
WISHT DRY THY EYES THERE'S A JOY KISS ME
WHAT IT WON'T KISS ME
HARETON DAMN THEE KISS ME BY GOD AS IF I WOULD REAR SUCH A MONSTER
AS SURE AS I'M LIVING I'LL BREAK THE BRAT'S NECK
POOR HARETON WAS SQUALLING AND KICKING IN HIS FATHER'S ARMS WITH ALL HIS
MIGHT AND REDOUBLED HIS YELLS WHEN HE CARRIED HIM UP STAIRS AND LIFTED
HIM OVER THE BANISTER
I CRIED OUT THAT HE WOULD FRIGHTEN THE CHILD INTO
FITS AND RAN TO RESCUE HIM
AS I REACHED THEM HINDLEY LEANT FORWARD ON
THE RAILS TO LISTEN TO A NOISE BELOW ALMOST FORGETTING WHAT HE HAD IN
HIS HANDS
'WHO IS THAT HE ASKED HEARING SOME ONE APPROACHING THE
STAIRS' FOOT
I LEANT FORWARD ALSO FOR THE PURPOSE OF SIGNING TO
HEATHCLIFF WHOSE STEP I RECOGNISED NOT TO COME FURTHER AND AT THE
INSTANT WHEN MY EYE QUITTED HARETON HE GAVE A SUDDEN SPRING DELIVERED
HIMSELF FROM THE CARELESS GRASP THAT HELD HIM AND FELL
THERE WAS SCARCELY TIME TO EXPERIENCE A THRILL OF HORROR BEFORE WE SAW
THAT THE LITTLE WRETCH WAS SAFE
HEATHCLIFF ARRIVED UNDERNEATH JUST AT
THE CRITICAL MOMENT BY A NATURAL IMPULSE HE ARRESTED HIS DESCENT AND
SETTING HIM ON HIS FEET LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THE AUTHOR OF THE
ACCIDENT
A MISER WHO HAS PARTED WITH A LUCKY LOTTERY TICKET FOR FIVE
SHILLINGS AND FINDS NEXT DAY HE HAS LOST IN THE BARGAIN FIVE THOUSAND
POUNDS COULD NOT SHOW A BLANKER COUNTENANCE THAN HE DID ON BEHOLDING THE
FIGURE OF MR
EARNSHAW ABOVE
IT EXPRESSED PLAINER THAN WORDS COULD DO
THE INTENSEST ANGUISH AT HAVING MADE HIMSELF THE INSTRUMENT OF THWARTING
HIS OWN REVENGE
HAD IT BEEN DARK I DARESAY HE WOULD HAVE TRIED TO
REMEDY THE MISTAKE BY SMASHING HARETON'S SKULL ON THE STEPS BUT WE
WITNESSED HIS SALVATION AND I WAS PRESENTLY BELOW WITH MY PRECIOUS
CHARGE PRESSED TO MY HEART
HINDLEY DESCENDED MORE LEISURELY SOBERED
AND ABASHED
'IT IS YOUR FAULT ELLEN HE SAID 'YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIM OUT OF
SIGHT YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM FROM ME IS HE INJURED ANYWHERE
'INJURED I CRIED ANGRILY 'IF HE IS NOT KILLED HE'LL BE AN IDIOT OH
I WONDER HIS MOTHER DOES NOT RISE FROM HER GRAVE TO SEE HOW YOU USE HIM
YOU'RE WORSE THAN A HEATHEN TREATING YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD IN THAT
MANNER HE ATTEMPTED TO TOUCH THE CHILD WHO ON FINDING HIMSELF WITH
ME SOBBED OFF HIS TERROR DIRECTLY
AT THE FIRST FINGER HIS FATHER LAID
ON HIM HOWEVER HE SHRIEKED AGAIN LOUDER THAN BEFORE AND STRUGGLED AS
IF HE WOULD GO INTO CONVULSIONS
'YOU SHALL NOT MEDDLE WITH HIM I CONTINUED
'HE HATES YOU THEY ALL
HATE YOU THAT'S THE TRUTH A HAPPY FAMILY YOU HAVE AND A PRETTY STATE
YOU'RE COME TO
'I SHALL COME TO A PRETTIER YET NELLY LAUGHED THE MISGUIDED MAN
RECOVERING HIS HARDNESS
'AT PRESENT CONVEY YOURSELF AND HIM AWAY
AND
HARK YOU HEATHCLIFF CLEAR YOU TOO QUITE FROM MY REACH AND HEARING
I
WOULDN'T MURDER YOU TO NIGHT UNLESS PERHAPS I SET THE HOUSE ON FIRE
BUT THAT'S AS MY FANCY GOES
WHILE SAYING THIS HE TOOK A PINT BOTTLE OF BRANDY FROM THE DRESSER AND
POURED SOME INTO A TUMBLER
'NAY DON'T I ENTREATED
'MR
HINDLEY DO TAKE WARNING
HAVE MERCY ON
THIS UNFORTUNATE BOY IF YOU CARE NOTHING FOR YOURSELF
'ANY ONE WILL DO BETTER FOR HIM THAN I SHALL HE ANSWERED
'HAVE MERCY ON YOUR OWN SOUL I SAID ENDEAVOURING TO SNATCH THE GLASS
FROM HIS HAND
'NOT I ON THE CONTRARY I SHALL HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN SENDING IT TO
PERDITION TO PUNISH ITS MAKER EXCLAIMED THE BLASPHEMER
'HERE'S TO ITS
HEARTY DAMNATION
HE DRANK THE SPIRITS AND IMPATIENTLY BADE US GO TERMINATING HIS COMMAND
WITH A SEQUEL OF HORRID IMPRECATIONS TOO BAD TO REPEAT OR REMEMBER
'IT'S A PITY HE CANNOT KILL HIMSELF WITH DRINK OBSERVED HEATHCLIFF
MUTTERING AN ECHO OF CURSES BACK WHEN THE DOOR WAS SHUT
'HE'S DOING HIS
VERY UTMOST BUT HIS CONSTITUTION DEFIES HIM
MR
KENNETH SAYS HE WOULD
WAGER HIS MARE THAT HE'LL OUTLIVE ANY MAN ON THIS SIDE GIMMERTON AND GO
TO THE GRAVE A HOARY SINNER UNLESS SOME HAPPY CHANCE OUT OF THE COMMON
COURSE BEFALL HIM
I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND SAT DOWN TO LULL MY LITTLE LAMB TO SLEEP
HEATHCLIFF AS I THOUGHT WALKED THROUGH TO THE BARN
IT TURNED OUT
AFTERWARDS THAT HE ONLY GOT AS FAR AS THE OTHER SIDE THE SETTLE WHEN HE
FLUNG HIMSELF ON A BENCH BY THE WALL REMOVED FROM THE FIRE AND REMAINED
SILENT
I WAS ROCKING HARETON ON MY KNEE AND HUMMING A SONG THAT BEGAN
IT WAS FAR IN THE NIGHT AND THE BAIRNIES GRAT
THE MITHER BENEATH THE MOOLS HEARD THAT
WHEN MISS CATHY WHO HAD LISTENED TO THE HUBBUB FROM HER ROOM PUT HER
HEAD IN AND WHISPERED 'ARE YOU ALONE NELLY
'YES MISS I REPLIED
SHE ENTERED AND APPROACHED THE HEARTH
I SUPPOSING SHE WAS GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING LOOKED UP
THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE SEEMED DISTURBED AND
ANXIOUS
HER LIPS WERE HALF ASUNDER AS IF SHE MEANT TO SPEAK AND SHE
DREW A BREATH BUT IT ESCAPED IN A SIGH INSTEAD OF A SENTENCE
I RESUMED
MY SONG NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN HER RECENT BEHAVIOUR
'WHERE'S HEATHCLIFF SHE SAID INTERRUPTING ME
'ABOUT HIS WORK IN THE STABLE WAS MY ANSWER
HE DID NOT CONTRADICT ME PERHAPS HE HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE
THERE
FOLLOWED ANOTHER LONG PAUSE DURING WHICH I PERCEIVED A DROP OR TWO
TRICKLE FROM CATHERINE'S CHEEK TO THE FLAGS
IS SHE SORRY FOR HER
SHAMEFUL CONDUCT I ASKED MYSELF
THAT WILL BE A NOVELTY BUT SHE MAY
COME TO THE POINT AS SHE WILL I SHA'N'T HELP HER NO SHE FELT SMALL
TROUBLE REGARDING ANY SUBJECT SAVE HER OWN CONCERNS
'OH DEAR SHE CRIED AT LAST
'I'M VERY UNHAPPY
'A PITY OBSERVED I
'YOU'RE HARD TO PLEASE SO MANY FRIENDS AND SO FEW
CARES AND CAN'T MAKE YOURSELF CONTENT
'NELLY WILL YOU KEEP A SECRET FOR ME SHE PURSUED KNEELING DOWN BY ME
AND LIFTING HER WINSOME EYES TO MY FACE WITH THAT SORT OF LOOK WHICH
TURNS OFF BAD TEMPER EVEN WHEN ONE HAS ALL THE RIGHT IN THE WORLD TO
INDULGE IT
'IS IT WORTH KEEPING I INQUIRED LESS SULKILY
'YES AND IT WORRIES ME AND I MUST LET IT OUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I
SHOULD DO
TO DAY EDGAR LINTON HAS ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM AND I'VE
GIVEN HIM AN ANSWER
NOW BEFORE I TELL YOU WHETHER IT WAS A CONSENT OR
DENIAL YOU TELL ME WHICH IT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN
'REALLY MISS CATHERINE HOW CAN I KNOW I REPLIED
'TO BE SURE
CONSIDERING THE EXHIBITION YOU PERFORMED IN HIS PRESENCE THIS AFTERNOON
I MIGHT SAY IT WOULD BE WISE TO REFUSE HIM SINCE HE ASKED YOU AFTER
THAT HE MUST EITHER BE HOPELESSLY STUPID OR A VENTURESOME FOOL
'IF YOU TALK SO I WON'T TELL YOU ANY MORE SHE RETURNED PEEVISHLY
RISING TO HER FEET
'I ACCEPTED HIM NELLY
BE QUICK AND SAY WHETHER I
WAS WRONG
'YOU ACCEPTED HIM THEN WHAT GOOD IS IT DISCUSSING THE MATTER YOU HAVE
PLEDGED YOUR WORD AND CANNOT RETRACT
'BUT SAY WHETHER I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO DO SHE EXCLAIMED IN AN
IRRITATED TONE CHAFING HER HANDS TOGETHER AND FROWNING
'THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO BE CONSIDERED BEFORE THAT QUESTION CAN BE
ANSWERED PROPERLY I SAID SENTENTIOUSLY
'FIRST AND FOREMOST DO YOU
LOVE MR
EDGAR
'WHO CAN HELP IT OF COURSE I DO SHE ANSWERED
THEN I PUT HER THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CATECHISM FOR A GIRL OF TWENTY TWO
IT WAS NOT INJUDICIOUS
'WHY DO YOU LOVE HIM MISS CATHY
'NONSENSE I DO THAT'S SUFFICIENT
'BY NO MEANS YOU MUST SAY WHY
'WELL BECAUSE HE IS HANDSOME AND PLEASANT TO BE WITH
'BAD WAS MY COMMENTARY
'AND BECAUSE HE IS YOUNG AND CHEERFUL
'BAD STILL
'AND BECAUSE HE LOVES ME
'INDIFFERENT COMING THERE
'AND HE WILL BE RICH AND I SHALL LIKE TO BE THE GREATEST WOMAN OF THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I SHALL BE PROUD OF HAVING SUCH A HUSBAND
'WORST OF ALL
AND NOW SAY HOW YOU LOVE HIM
'AS EVERYBODY LOVES YOU'RE SILLY NELLY
'NOT AT ALL ANSWER
'I LOVE THE GROUND UNDER HIS FEET AND THE AIR OVER HIS HEAD AND
EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES AND EVERY WORD HE SAYS
I LOVE ALL HIS LOOKS AND
ALL HIS ACTIONS AND HIM ENTIRELY AND ALTOGETHER
THERE NOW
'AND WHY
'NAY YOU ARE MAKING A JEST OF IT IT IS EXCEEDINGLY ILL NATURED IT'S
NO JEST TO ME SAID THE YOUNG LADY SCOWLING AND TURNING HER FACE TO
THE FIRE
'I'M VERY FAR FROM JESTING MISS CATHERINE I REPLIED
'YOU LOVE MR
EDGAR BECAUSE HE IS HANDSOME AND YOUNG AND CHEERFUL AND RICH AND
LOVES YOU
THE LAST HOWEVER GOES FOR NOTHING YOU WOULD LOVE HIM
WITHOUT THAT PROBABLY AND WITH IT YOU WOULDN'T UNLESS HE POSSESSED THE
FOUR FORMER ATTRACTIONS
'NO TO BE SURE NOT I SHOULD ONLY PITY HIM HATE HIM PERHAPS IF HE
WERE UGLY AND A CLOWN
'BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER HANDSOME RICH YOUNG MEN IN THE WORLD
HANDSOMER POSSIBLY AND RICHER THAN HE IS
WHAT SHOULD HINDER YOU FROM
LOVING THEM
'IF THERE BE ANY THEY ARE OUT OF MY WAY I'VE SEEN NONE LIKE EDGAR
'YOU MAY SEE SOME AND HE WON'T ALWAYS BE HANDSOME AND YOUNG AND MAY
NOT ALWAYS BE RICH
'HE IS NOW AND I HAVE ONLY TO DO WITH THE PRESENT
I WISH YOU WOULD
SPEAK RATIONALLY
'WELL THAT SETTLES IT IF YOU HAVE ONLY TO DO WITH THE PRESENT MARRY
MR
LINTON
'I DON'T WANT YOUR PERMISSION FOR THAT I SHALL MARRY HIM AND YET YOU
HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHETHER I'M RIGHT
'PERFECTLY RIGHT IF PEOPLE BE RIGHT TO MARRY ONLY FOR THE PRESENT
AND
NOW LET US HEAR WHAT YOU ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER WILL BE
PLEASED THE OLD LADY AND GENTLEMAN WILL NOT OBJECT I THINK YOU WILL
ESCAPE FROM A DISORDERLY COMFORTLESS HOME INTO A WEALTHY RESPECTABLE
ONE AND YOU LOVE EDGAR AND EDGAR LOVES YOU
ALL SEEMS SMOOTH AND EASY
WHERE IS THE OBSTACLE
HERE AND HERE REPLIED CATHERINE STRIKING ONE HAND ON HER
FOREHEAD AND THE OTHER ON HER BREAST 'IN WHICHEVER PLACE THE SOUL
LIVES
IN MY SOUL AND IN MY HEART I'M CONVINCED I'M WRONG
'THAT'S VERY STRANGE I CANNOT MAKE IT OUT
'IT'S MY SECRET
BUT IF YOU WILL NOT MOCK AT ME I'LL EXPLAIN IT I
CAN'T DO IT DISTINCTLY BUT I'LL GIVE YOU A FEELING OF HOW I FEEL
SHE SEATED HERSELF BY ME AGAIN HER COUNTENANCE GREW SADDER AND GRAVER
AND HER CLASPED HANDS TREMBLED
'NELLY DO YOU NEVER DREAM QUEER DREAMS SHE SAID SUDDENLY AFTER SOME
MINUTES' REFLECTION
'YES NOW AND THEN I ANSWERED
'AND SO DO I
I'VE DREAMT IN MY LIFE DREAMS THAT HAVE STAYED WITH ME
EVER AFTER AND CHANGED MY IDEAS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH AND THROUGH ME
LIKE WINE THROUGH WATER AND ALTERED THE COLOUR OF MY MIND
AND THIS IS
ONE I'M GOING TO TELL IT BUT TAKE CARE NOT TO SMILE AT ANY PART OF IT
'OH DON'T MISS CATHERINE I CRIED
'WE'RE DISMAL ENOUGH WITHOUT
CONJURING UP GHOSTS AND VISIONS TO PERPLEX US
COME COME BE MERRY AND
LIKE YOURSELF LOOK AT LITTLE HARETON HE'S DREAMING NOTHING DREARY
HOW SWEETLY HE SMILES IN HIS SLEEP
'YES AND HOW SWEETLY HIS FATHER CURSES IN HIS SOLITUDE YOU REMEMBER
HIM I DARESAY WHEN HE WAS JUST SUCH ANOTHER AS THAT CHUBBY THING
NEARLY AS YOUNG AND INNOCENT
HOWEVER NELLY I SHALL OBLIGE YOU TO
LISTEN IT'S NOT LONG AND I'VE NO POWER TO BE MERRY TO NIGHT
'I WON'T HEAR IT I WON'T HEAR IT I REPEATED HASTILY
I WAS SUPERSTITIOUS ABOUT DREAMS THEN AND AM STILL AND CATHERINE HAD AN
UNUSUAL GLOOM IN HER ASPECT THAT MADE ME DREAD SOMETHING FROM WHICH I
MIGHT SHAPE A PROPHECY AND FORESEE A FEARFUL CATASTROPHE
SHE WAS
VEXED BUT SHE DID NOT PROCEED
APPARENTLY TAKING UP ANOTHER SUBJECT
SHE RECOMMENCED IN A SHORT TIME
'IF I WERE IN HEAVEN NELLY I SHOULD BE EXTREMELY MISERABLE
'BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FIT TO GO THERE I ANSWERED
'ALL SINNERS WOULD BE
MISERABLE IN HEAVEN
'BUT IT IS NOT FOR THAT
I DREAMT ONCE THAT I WAS THERE
'I TELL YOU I WON'T HEARKEN TO YOUR DREAMS MISS CATHERINE I'LL GO TO
BED I INTERRUPTED AGAIN
SHE LAUGHED AND HELD ME DOWN FOR I MADE A MOTION TO LEAVE MY CHAIR
'THIS IS NOTHING CRIED SHE 'I WAS ONLY GOING TO SAY THAT HEAVEN DID
NOT SEEM TO BE MY HOME AND I BROKE MY HEART WITH WEEPING TO COME BACK TO
EARTH AND THE ANGELS WERE SO ANGRY THAT THEY FLUNG ME OUT INTO THE
MIDDLE OF THE HEATH ON THE TOP OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS WHERE I WOKE SOBBING
FOR JOY
THAT WILL DO TO EXPLAIN MY SECRET AS WELL AS THE OTHER
I'VE
NO MORE BUSINESS TO MARRY EDGAR LINTON THAN I HAVE TO BE IN HEAVEN AND
IF THE WICKED MAN IN THERE HAD NOT BROUGHT HEATHCLIFF SO LOW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE THOUGHT OF IT
IT WOULD DEGRADE ME TO MARRY HEATHCLIFF NOW SO HE
SHALL NEVER KNOW HOW I LOVE HIM AND THAT NOT BECAUSE HE'S HANDSOME
NELLY BUT BECAUSE HE'S MORE MYSELF THAN I AM
WHATEVER OUR SOULS ARE
MADE OF HIS AND MINE ARE THE SAME AND LINTON'S IS AS DIFFERENT AS A
MOONBEAM FROM LIGHTNING OR FROST FROM FIRE
ERE THIS SPEECH ENDED I BECAME SENSIBLE OF HEATHCLIFF'S PRESENCE
HAVING
NOTICED A SLIGHT MOVEMENT I TURNED MY HEAD AND SAW HIM RISE FROM THE
BENCH AND STEAL OUT NOISELESSLY
HE HAD LISTENED TILL HE HEARD
CATHERINE SAY IT WOULD DEGRADE HER TO MARRY HIM AND THEN HE STAYED TO
HEAR NO FURTHER
MY COMPANION SITTING ON THE GROUND WAS PREVENTED BY
THE BACK OF THE SETTLE FROM REMARKING HIS PRESENCE OR DEPARTURE BUT I
STARTED AND BADE HER HUSH
'WHY SHE ASKED GAZING NERVOUSLY ROUND
'JOSEPH IS HERE I ANSWERED CATCHING OPPORTUNELY THE ROLL OF HIS
CARTWHEELS UP THE ROAD 'AND HEATHCLIFF WILL COME IN WITH HIM
I'M NOT
SURE WHETHER HE WERE NOT AT THE DOOR THIS MOMENT
'OH HE COULDN'T OVERHEAR ME AT THE DOOR SAID SHE
'GIVE ME HARETON
WHILE YOU GET THE SUPPER AND WHEN IT IS READY ASK ME TO SUP WITH YOU
I
WANT TO CHEAT MY UNCOMFORTABLE CONSCIENCE AND BE CONVINCED THAT
HEATHCLIFF HAS NO NOTION OF THESE THINGS
HE HAS NOT HAS HE HE DOES
NOT KNOW WHAT BEING IN LOVE IS
'I SEE NO REASON THAT HE SHOULD NOT KNOW AS WELL AS YOU I RETURNED
'AND IF YOU ARE HIS CHOICE HE'LL BE THE MOST UNFORTUNATE CREATURE THAT
EVER WAS BORN AS SOON AS YOU BECOME MRS
LINTON HE LOSES FRIEND AND
LOVE AND ALL HAVE YOU CONSIDERED HOW YOU'LL BEAR THE SEPARATION AND
HOW HE'LL BEAR TO BE QUITE DESERTED IN THE WORLD BECAUSE MISS
CATHERINE
'HE QUITE DESERTED WE SEPARATED SHE EXCLAIMED WITH AN ACCENT OF
INDIGNATION
'WHO IS TO SEPARATE US PRAY THEY'LL MEET THE FATE OF
MILO NOT AS LONG AS I LIVE ELLEN FOR NO MORTAL CREATURE
EVERY
LINTON ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH MIGHT MELT INTO NOTHING BEFORE I COULD
CONSENT TO FORSAKE HEATHCLIFF
OH THAT'S NOT WHAT I INTEND THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN I SHOULDN'T BE MRS
LINTON WERE SUCH A PRICE DEMANDED
HE'LL BE AS MUCH TO ME AS HE HAS BEEN ALL HIS LIFETIME
EDGAR MUST SHAKE
OFF HIS ANTIPATHY AND TOLERATE HIM AT LEAST
HE WILL WHEN HE LEARNS
MY TRUE FEELINGS TOWARDS HIM
NELLY I SEE NOW YOU THINK ME A SELFISH
WRETCH BUT DID IT NEVER STRIKE YOU THAT IF HEATHCLIFF AND I MARRIED WE
SHOULD BE BEGGARS WHEREAS IF I MARRY LINTON I CAN AID HEATHCLIFF TO
RISE AND PLACE HIM OUT OF MY BROTHER'S POWER
'WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S MONEY MISS CATHERINE I ASKED
'YOU'LL FIND HIM
NOT SO PLIABLE AS YOU CALCULATE UPON AND THOUGH I'M HARDLY A JUDGE I
THINK THAT'S THE WORST MOTIVE YOU'VE GIVEN YET FOR BEING THE WIFE OF
YOUNG LINTON
'IT IS NOT RETORTED SHE 'IT IS THE BEST THE OTHERS WERE THE
SATISFACTION OF MY WHIMS AND FOR EDGAR'S SAKE TOO TO SATISFY HIM
THIS
IS FOR THE SAKE OF ONE WHO COMPREHENDS IN HIS PERSON MY FEELINGS TO EDGAR
AND MYSELF
I CANNOT EXPRESS IT BUT SURELY YOU AND EVERYBODY HAVE A
NOTION THAT THERE IS OR SHOULD BE AN EXISTENCE OF YOURS BEYOND YOU
WHAT
WERE THE USE OF MY CREATION IF I WERE ENTIRELY CONTAINED HERE MY GREAT
MISERIES IN THIS WORLD HAVE BEEN HEATHCLIFF'S MISERIES AND I WATCHED AND
FELT EACH FROM THE BEGINNING MY GREAT THOUGHT IN LIVING IS HIMSELF
IF
ALL ELSE PERISHED AND HE REMAINED I SHOULD STILL CONTINUE TO BE
AND IF ALL ELSE REMAINED AND HE WERE ANNIHILATED THE UNIVERSE WOULD
TURN TO A MIGHTY STRANGER I SHOULD NOT SEEM A PART OF IT MY LOVE FOR
LINTON IS LIKE THE FOLIAGE IN THE WOODS TIME WILL CHANGE IT I'M WELL
AWARE AS WINTER CHANGES THE TREES
MY LOVE FOR HEATHCLIFF RESEMBLES THE
ETERNAL ROCKS BENEATH A SOURCE OF LITTLE VISIBLE DELIGHT BUT NECESSARY
NELLY I AM HEATHCLIFF HE'S ALWAYS ALWAYS IN MY MIND NOT AS A
PLEASURE ANY MORE THAN I AM ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO MYSELF BUT AS MY OWN
BEING
SO DON'T TALK OF OUR SEPARATION AGAIN IT IS IMPRACTICABLE AND
SHE PAUSED AND HID HER FACE IN THE FOLDS OF MY GOWN BUT I JERKED IT
FORCIBLY AWAY
I WAS OUT OF PATIENCE WITH HER FOLLY
'IF I CAN MAKE ANY SENSE OF YOUR NONSENSE MISS I SAID 'IT ONLY GOES
TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU ARE IGNORANT OF THE DUTIES YOU UNDERTAKE IN
MARRYING OR ELSE THAT YOU ARE A WICKED UNPRINCIPLED GIRL
BUT TROUBLE
ME WITH NO MORE SECRETS I'LL NOT PROMISE TO KEEP THEM
'YOU'LL KEEP THAT SHE ASKED EAGERLY
'NO I'LL NOT PROMISE I REPEATED
SHE WAS ABOUT TO INSIST WHEN THE ENTRANCE OF JOSEPH FINISHED OUR
CONVERSATION AND CATHERINE REMOVED HER SEAT TO A CORNER AND NURSED
HARETON WHILE I MADE THE SUPPER
AFTER IT WAS COOKED MY FELLOW SERVANT
AND I BEGAN TO QUARREL WHO SHOULD CARRY SOME TO MR
HINDLEY AND WE
DIDN'T SETTLE IT TILL ALL WAS NEARLY COLD
THEN WE CAME TO THE AGREEMENT
THAT WE WOULD LET HIM ASK IF HE WANTED ANY FOR WE FEARED PARTICULARLY
TO GO INTO HIS PRESENCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN SOME TIME ALONE
'AND HOW ISN'T THAT NOWT COMED IN FRO' TH' FIELD BE THIS TIME WHAT IS
HE ABOUT GIRT IDLE SEEGHT DEMANDED THE OLD MAN LOOKING ROUND FOR
HEATHCLIFF
'I'LL CALL HIM I REPLIED
'HE'S IN THE BARN I'VE NO DOUBT
I WENT AND CALLED BUT GOT NO ANSWER
ON RETURNING I WHISPERED TO
CATHERINE THAT HE HAD HEARD A GOOD PART OF WHAT SHE SAID I WAS SURE AND
TOLD HOW I SAW HIM QUIT THE KITCHEN JUST AS SHE COMPLAINED OF HER
BROTHER'S CONDUCT REGARDING HIM
SHE JUMPED UP IN A FINE FRIGHT FLUNG
HARETON ON TO THE SETTLE AND RAN TO SEEK FOR HER FRIEND HERSELF NOT
TAKING LEISURE TO CONSIDER WHY SHE WAS SO FLURRIED OR HOW HER TALK WOULD
HAVE AFFECTED HIM
SHE WAS ABSENT SUCH A WHILE THAT JOSEPH PROPOSED WE
SHOULD WAIT NO LONGER
HE CUNNINGLY CONJECTURED THEY WERE STAYING AWAY
IN ORDER TO AVOID HEARING HIS PROTRACTED BLESSING
THEY WERE 'ILL ENEUGH
FOR ONY FAHL MANNERS HE AFFIRMED
AND ON THEIR BEHALF HE ADDED THAT
NIGHT A SPECIAL PRAYER TO THE USUAL QUARTER OF AN HOUR'S SUPPLICATION
BEFORE MEAT AND WOULD HAVE TACKED ANOTHER TO THE END OF THE GRACE HAD
NOT HIS YOUNG MISTRESS BROKEN IN UPON HIM WITH A HURRIED COMMAND THAT HE
MUST RUN DOWN THE ROAD AND WHEREVER HEATHCLIFF HAD RAMBLED FIND AND
MAKE HIM RE ENTER DIRECTLY
'I WANT TO SPEAK TO HIM AND I MUST BEFORE I GO UPSTAIRS SHE SAID
'AND THE GATE IS OPEN HE IS SOMEWHERE OUT OF HEARING FOR HE WOULD NOT
REPLY THOUGH I SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF THE FOLD AS LOUD AS I COULD
JOSEPH OBJECTED AT FIRST SHE WAS TOO MUCH IN EARNEST HOWEVER TO SUFFER
CONTRADICTION AND AT LAST HE PLACED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND WALKED
GRUMBLING FORTH
MEANTIME CATHERINE PACED UP AND DOWN THE FLOOR
EXCLAIMING 'I WONDER WHERE HE IS I WONDER WHERE HE CAN BE WHAT DID I
SAY NELLY I'VE FORGOTTEN
WAS HE VEXED AT MY BAD HUMOUR THIS
AFTERNOON DEAR TELL ME WHAT I'VE SAID TO GRIEVE HIM I DO WISH HE'D
COME
I DO WISH HE WOULD
'WHAT A NOISE FOR NOTHING I CRIED THOUGH RATHER UNEASY MYSELF
'WHAT
A TRIFLE SCARES YOU IT'S SURELY NO GREAT CAUSE OF ALARM THAT HEATHCLIFF
SHOULD TAKE A MOONLIGHT SAUNTER ON THE MOORS OR EVEN LIE TOO SULKY TO
SPEAK TO US IN THE HAY LOFT
I'LL ENGAGE HE'S LURKING THERE
SEE IF I
DON'T FERRET HIM OUT
I DEPARTED TO RENEW MY SEARCH ITS RESULT WAS DISAPPOINTMENT AND
JOSEPH'S QUEST ENDED IN THE SAME
'YON LAD GETS WAR UND WAR OBSERVED HE ON RE ENTERING
'HE'S LEFT TH'
GATE AT T' FULL SWING AND MISS'S PONY HAS TRODDEN DAHN TWO RIGS O' CORN
AND PLOTTERED THROUGH RAIGHT O'ER INTO T' MEADOW HAHSOMDIVER T'
MAISTER 'ULL PLAY T' DEVIL TO MORN AND HE'LL DO WEEL

HE'LL NOT BE SOA ALLUS YAH'S SEE ALL ON YE YAH MUN'N'T DRIVE HIM OUT
OF HIS HEEAD FOR NOWT
'HAVE YOU FOUND HEATHCLIFF YOU ASS INTERRUPTED CATHERINE
'HAVE YOU
BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM AS I ORDERED
'I SUD MORE LIKKER LOOK FOR TH' HORSE HE REPLIED
'IT 'UD BE TO MORE
SENSE
BUD I CAN LOOK FOR NORTHER HORSE NUR MAN OF A NEEGHT LOIKE
THIS AS BLACK AS T' CHIMBLEY UND HEATHCLIFF'S NOAN T' CHAP TO COOM AT
MY WHISTLE HAPPEN HE'LL BE LESS HARD O' HEARING WI' YE
IT WAS A VERY DARK EVENING FOR SUMMER THE CLOUDS APPEARED INCLINED TO
THUNDER AND I SAID WE HAD BETTER ALL SIT DOWN THE APPROACHING RAIN
WOULD BE CERTAIN TO BRING HIM HOME WITHOUT FURTHER TROUBLE
HOWEVER
CATHERINE WOULD NOT BE PERSUADED INTO TRANQUILLITY
SHE KEPT WANDERING
TO AND FRO FROM THE GATE TO THE DOOR IN A STATE OF AGITATION WHICH
PERMITTED NO REPOSE AND AT LENGTH TOOK UP A PERMANENT SITUATION ON ONE
SIDE OF THE WALL NEAR THE ROAD WHERE HEEDLESS OF MY EXPOSTULATIONS AND
THE GROWLING THUNDER AND THE GREAT DROPS THAT BEGAN TO PLASH AROUND HER
SHE REMAINED CALLING AT INTERVALS AND THEN LISTENING AND THEN CRYING
OUTRIGHT
SHE BEAT HARETON OR ANY CHILD AT A GOOD PASSIONATE FIT OF
CRYING
ABOUT MIDNIGHT WHILE WE STILL SAT UP THE STORM CAME RATTLING OVER THE
HEIGHTS IN FULL FURY
THERE WAS A VIOLENT WIND AS WELL AS THUNDER AND
EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER SPLIT A TREE OFF AT THE CORNER OF THE BUILDING A
HUGE BOUGH FELL ACROSS THE ROOF AND KNOCKED DOWN A PORTION OF THE EAST
CHIMNEY STACK SENDING A CLATTER OF STONES AND SOOT INTO THE
KITCHEN FIRE
WE THOUGHT A BOLT HAD FALLEN IN THE MIDDLE OF US AND
JOSEPH SWUNG ON TO HIS KNEES BESEECHING THE LORD TO REMEMBER THE
PATRIARCHS NOAH AND LOT AND AS IN FORMER TIMES SPARE THE RIGHTEOUS
THOUGH HE SMOTE THE UNGODLY
I FELT SOME SENTIMENT THAT IT MUST BE A
JUDGMENT ON US ALSO
THE JONAH IN MY MIND WAS MR
EARNSHAW AND I
SHOOK THE HANDLE OF HIS DEN THAT I MIGHT ASCERTAIN IF HE WERE YET LIVING
HE REPLIED AUDIBLY ENOUGH IN A FASHION WHICH MADE MY COMPANION
VOCIFERATE MORE CLAMOROUSLY THAN BEFORE THAT A WIDE DISTINCTION MIGHT
BE DRAWN BETWEEN SAINTS LIKE HIMSELF AND SINNERS LIKE HIS MASTER
BUT
THE UPROAR PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY MINUTES LEAVING US ALL UNHARMED
EXCEPTING CATHY WHO GOT THOROUGHLY DRENCHED FOR HER OBSTINACY IN
REFUSING TO TAKE SHELTER AND STANDING BONNETLESS AND SHAWLLESS TO CATCH
AS MUCH WATER AS SHE COULD WITH HER HAIR AND CLOTHES
SHE CAME IN AND
LAY DOWN ON THE SETTLE ALL SOAKED AS SHE WAS TURNING HER FACE TO THE
BACK AND PUTTING HER HANDS BEFORE IT
'WELL MISS I EXCLAIMED TOUCHING HER SHOULDER 'YOU ARE NOT BENT ON
GETTING YOUR DEATH ARE YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT O'CLOCK IT IS HALF PAST
TWELVE
COME COME TO BED THERE'S NO USE WAITING ANY LONGER ON THAT
FOOLISH BOY HE'LL BE GONE TO GIMMERTON AND HE'LL STAY THERE NOW
HE
GUESSES WE SHOULDN'T WAIT FOR HIM TILL THIS LATE HOUR AT LEAST HE
GUESSES THAT ONLY MR
HINDLEY WOULD BE UP AND HE'D RATHER AVOID HAVING
THE DOOR OPENED BY THE MASTER
'NAY NAY HE'S NOAN AT GIMMERTON SAID JOSEPH
'I'S NIVER WONDER BUT
HE'S AT T' BOTHOM OF A BOG HOILE

SEVERAL TEXTS REFERRING US TO CHAPTERS AND VERSES WHERE WE MIGHT FIND
THEM
I HAVING VAINLY BEGGED THE WILFUL GIRL TO RISE AND REMOVE HER WET
THINGS LEFT HIM PREACHING AND HER SHIVERING AND BETOOK MYSELF TO BED
WITH LITTLE HARETON WHO SLEPT AS FAST AS IF EVERYONE HAD BEEN SLEEPING
ROUND HIM
I HEARD JOSEPH READ ON A WHILE AFTERWARDS THEN I
DISTINGUISHED HIS SLOW STEP ON THE LADDER AND THEN I DROPPED ASLEEP
COMING DOWN SOMEWHAT LATER THAN USUAL I SAW BY THE SUNBEAMS PIERCING
THE CHINKS OF THE SHUTTERS MISS CATHERINE STILL SEATED NEAR THE
FIREPLACE
THE HOUSE DOOR WAS AJAR TOO LIGHT ENTERED FROM ITS UNCLOSED
WINDOWS HINDLEY HAD COME OUT AND STOOD ON THE KITCHEN HEARTH HAGGARD
AND DROWSY
'WHAT AILS YOU CATHY HE WAS SAYING WHEN I ENTERED 'YOU LOOK AS DISMAL
AS A DROWNED WHELP
WHY ARE YOU SO DAMP AND PALE CHILD
'I'VE BEEN WET SHE ANSWERED RELUCTANTLY 'AND I'M COLD THAT'S ALL
'OH SHE IS NAUGHTY I CRIED PERCEIVING THE MASTER TO BE TOLERABLY
SOBER
'SHE GOT STEEPED IN THE SHOWER OF YESTERDAY EVENING AND THERE
SHE HAS SAT THE NIGHT THROUGH AND I COULDN'T PREVAIL ON HER TO STIR
MR
EARNSHAW STARED AT US IN SURPRISE
'THE NIGHT THROUGH HE REPEATED
'WHAT KEPT HER UP NOT FEAR OF THE THUNDER SURELY THAT WAS OVER HOURS
SINCE
NEITHER OF US WISHED TO MENTION HEATHCLIFF'S ABSENCE AS LONG AS WE COULD
CONCEAL IT SO I REPLIED I DIDN'T KNOW HOW SHE TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD TO
SIT UP AND SHE SAID NOTHING
THE MORNING WAS FRESH AND COOL I THREW
BACK THE LATTICE AND PRESENTLY THE ROOM FILLED WITH SWEET SCENTS FROM
THE GARDEN BUT CATHERINE CALLED PEEVISHLY TO ME 'ELLEN SHUT THE
WINDOW
I'M STARVING AND HER TEETH CHATTERED AS SHE SHRANK CLOSER TO
THE ALMOST EXTINGUISHED EMBERS
'SHE'S ILL SAID HINDLEY TAKING HER WRIST 'I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE REASON
SHE WOULD NOT GO TO BED
DAMN IT I DON'T WANT TO BE TROUBLED WITH MORE
SICKNESS HERE
WHAT TOOK YOU INTO THE RAIN
'RUNNING AFTER T' LADS AS USUALD CROAKED JOSEPH CATCHING AN
OPPORTUNITY FROM OUR HESITATION TO THRUST IN HIS EVIL TONGUE
'IF I WAR

'I NEVER SAW HEATHCLIFF LAST NIGHT ANSWERED CATHERINE BEGINNING TO SOB
BITTERLY 'AND IF YOU DO TURN HIM OUT OF DOORS I'LL GO WITH HIM

BURST INTO UNCONTROLLABLE GRIEF AND THE REMAINDER OF HER WORDS WERE
INARTICULATE
HINDLEY LAVISHED ON HER A TORRENT OF SCORNFUL ABUSE AND BADE HER GET TO
HER ROOM IMMEDIATELY OR SHE SHOULDN'T CRY FOR NOTHING I OBLIGED HER TO
OBEY AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT A SCENE SHE ACTED WHEN WE REACHED HER
CHAMBER IT TERRIFIED ME
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING MAD AND I BEGGED
JOSEPH TO RUN FOR THE DOCTOR
IT PROVED THE COMMENCEMENT OF DELIRIUM
MR
KENNETH AS SOON AS HE SAW HER PRONOUNCED HER DANGEROUSLY ILL SHE
HAD A FEVER
HE BLED HER AND HE TOLD ME TO LET HER LIVE ON WHEY AND
WATER GRUEL AND TAKE CARE SHE DID NOT THROW HERSELF DOWNSTAIRS OR OUT OF
THE WINDOW AND THEN HE LEFT FOR HE HAD ENOUGH TO DO IN THE PARISH
WHERE TWO OR THREE MILES WAS THE ORDINARY DISTANCE BETWEEN COTTAGE AND
COTTAGE
THOUGH I CANNOT SAY I MADE A GENTLE NURSE AND JOSEPH AND THE MASTER WERE
NO BETTER AND THOUGH OUR PATIENT WAS AS WEARISOME AND HEADSTRONG AS A
PATIENT COULD BE SHE WEATHERED IT THROUGH
OLD MRS
LINTON PAID US
SEVERAL VISITS TO BE SURE AND SET THINGS TO RIGHTS AND SCOLDED AND
ORDERED US ALL AND WHEN CATHERINE WAS CONVALESCENT SHE INSISTED ON
CONVEYING HER TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE FOR WHICH DELIVERANCE WE WERE VERY
GRATEFUL
BUT THE POOR DAME HAD REASON TO REPENT OF HER KINDNESS SHE
AND HER HUSBAND BOTH TOOK THE FEVER AND DIED WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF EACH
OTHER
OUR YOUNG LADY RETURNED TO US SAUCIER AND MORE PASSIONATE AND HAUGHTIER
THAN EVER
HEATHCLIFF HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF SINCE THE EVENING OF THE
THUNDER STORM AND ONE DAY I HAD THE MISFORTUNE WHEN SHE HAD PROVOKED
ME EXCEEDINGLY TO LAY THE BLAME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE ON HER WHERE
INDEED IT BELONGED AS SHE WELL KNEW
FROM THAT PERIOD FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS SHE CEASED TO HOLD ANY COMMUNICATION WITH ME SAVE IN THE
RELATION OF A MERE SERVANT
JOSEPH FELL UNDER A BAN ALSO HE WOULD SPEAK
HIS MIND AND LECTURE HER ALL THE SAME AS IF SHE WERE A LITTLE GIRL AND
SHE ESTEEMED HERSELF A WOMAN AND OUR MISTRESS AND THOUGHT THAT HER
RECENT ILLNESS GAVE HER A CLAIM TO BE TREATED WITH CONSIDERATION
THEN
THE DOCTOR HAD SAID THAT SHE WOULD NOT BEAR CROSSING MUCH SHE OUGHT TO
HAVE HER OWN WAY AND IT WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MURDER IN HER EYES FOR ANY
ONE TO PRESUME TO STAND UP AND CONTRADICT HER
FROM MR
EARNSHAW AND HIS
COMPANIONS SHE KEPT ALOOF AND TUTORED BY KENNETH AND SERIOUS THREATS OF
A FIT THAT OFTEN ATTENDED HER RAGES HER BROTHER ALLOWED HER WHATEVER SHE
PLEASED TO DEMAND AND GENERALLY AVOIDED AGGRAVATING HER FIERY TEMPER
HE
WAS RATHER TOO INDULGENT IN HUMOURING HER CAPRICES NOT FROM AFFECTION
BUT FROM PRIDE HE WISHED EARNESTLY TO SEE HER BRING HONOUR TO THE FAMILY
BY AN ALLIANCE WITH THE LINTONS AND AS LONG AS SHE LET HIM ALONE SHE
MIGHT TRAMPLE ON US LIKE SLAVES FOR AUGHT HE CARED EDGAR LINTON AS
MULTITUDES HAVE BEEN BEFORE AND WILL BE AFTER HIM WAS INFATUATED AND
BELIEVED HIMSELF THE HAPPIEST MAN ALIVE ON THE DAY HE LED HER TO
GIMMERTON CHAPEL THREE YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO HIS FATHER'S DEATH
MUCH AGAINST MY INCLINATION I WAS PERSUADED TO LEAVE WUTHERING HEIGHTS
AND ACCOMPANY HER HERE
LITTLE HARETON WAS NEARLY FIVE YEARS OLD AND I
HAD JUST BEGUN TO TEACH HIM HIS LETTERS
WE MADE A SAD PARTING BUT
CATHERINE'S TEARS WERE MORE POWERFUL THAN OURS
WHEN I REFUSED TO GO
AND WHEN SHE FOUND HER ENTREATIES DID NOT MOVE ME SHE WENT LAMENTING TO
HER HUSBAND AND BROTHER
THE FORMER OFFERED ME MUNIFICENT WAGES THE
LATTER ORDERED ME TO PACK UP HE WANTED NO WOMEN IN THE HOUSE HE SAID
NOW THAT THERE WAS NO MISTRESS AND AS TO HARETON THE CURATE SHOULD TAKE
HIM IN HAND BY AND BY
AND SO I HAD BUT ONE CHOICE LEFT TO DO AS I WAS
ORDERED
I TOLD THE MASTER HE GOT RID OF ALL DECENT PEOPLE ONLY TO RUN
TO RUIN A LITTLE FASTER I KISSED HARETON SAID GOOD BY AND SINCE THEN
HE HAS BEEN A STRANGER AND IT'S VERY QUEER TO THINK IT BUT I'VE NO
DOUBT HE HAS COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ELLEN DEAN AND THAT HE WAS
EVER MORE THAN ALL THE WORLD TO HER AND SHE TO HIM
AT THIS POINT OF THE HOUSEKEEPER'S STORY SHE CHANCED TO GLANCE TOWARDS
THE TIME PIECE OVER THE CHIMNEY AND WAS IN AMAZEMENT ON SEEING THE
MINUTE HAND MEASURE HALF PAST ONE
SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF STAYING A
SECOND LONGER IN TRUTH I FELT RATHER DISPOSED TO DEFER THE SEQUEL OF
HER NARRATIVE MYSELF
AND NOW THAT SHE IS VANISHED TO HER REST AND I
HAVE MEDITATED FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR TWO I SHALL SUMMON COURAGE TO GO
ALSO IN SPITE OF ACHING LAZINESS OF HEAD AND LIMBS
CHAPTER X
A CHARMING INTRODUCTION TO A HERMIT'S LIFE FOUR WEEKS' TORTURE
TOSSING AND SICKNESS OH THESE BLEAK WINDS AND BITTER NORTHERN SKIES
AND IMPASSABLE ROADS AND DILATORY COUNTRY SURGEONS AND OH THIS DEARTH
OF THE HUMAN PHYSIOGNOMY AND WORSE THAN ALL THE TERRIBLE INTIMATION OF
KENNETH THAT I NEED NOT EXPECT TO BE OUT OF DOORS TILL SPRING
MR
HEATHCLIFF HAS JUST HONOURED ME WITH A CALL
ABOUT SEVEN DAYS AGO HE
SENT ME A BRACE OF GROUSE THE LAST OF THE SEASON
SCOUNDREL HE IS NOT
ALTOGETHER GUILTLESS IN THIS ILLNESS OF MINE AND THAT I HAD A GREAT MIND
TO TELL HIM
BUT ALAS HOW COULD I OFFEND A MAN WHO WAS CHARITABLE
ENOUGH TO SIT AT MY BEDSIDE A GOOD HOUR AND TALK ON SOME OTHER SUBJECT
THAN PILLS AND DRAUGHTS BLISTERS AND LEECHES THIS IS QUITE AN EASY
INTERVAL
I AM TOO WEAK TO READ YET I FEEL AS IF I COULD ENJOY
SOMETHING INTERESTING
WHY NOT HAVE UP MRS
DEAN TO FINISH HER TALE I
CAN RECOLLECT ITS CHIEF INCIDENTS AS FAR AS SHE HAD GONE
YES I
REMEMBER HER HERO HAD RUN OFF AND NEVER BEEN HEARD OF FOR THREE YEARS
AND THE HEROINE WAS MARRIED
I'LL RING SHE'LL BE DELIGHTED TO FIND ME
CAPABLE OF TALKING CHEERFULLY
MRS
DEAN CAME
'IT WANTS TWENTY MINUTES SIR TO TAKING THE MEDICINE SHE COMMENCED
'AWAY AWAY WITH IT I REPLIED 'I DESIRE TO HAVE
'THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU MUST DROP THE POWDERS
'WITH ALL MY HEART DON'T INTERRUPT ME
COME AND TAKE YOUR SEAT HERE
KEEP YOUR FINGERS FROM THAT BITTER PHALANX OF VIALS
DRAW YOUR KNITTING
OUT OF YOUR POCKET THAT WILL DO NOW CONTINUE THE HISTORY OF MR
HEATHCLIFF FROM WHERE YOU LEFT OFF TO THE PRESENT DAY
DID HE FINISH
HIS EDUCATION ON THE CONTINENT AND COME BACK A GENTLEMAN OR DID HE GET
A SIZAR'S PLACE AT COLLEGE OR ESCAPE TO AMERICA AND EARN HONOURS BY
DRAWING BLOOD FROM HIS FOSTER COUNTRY OR MAKE A FORTUNE MORE PROMPTLY ON
THE ENGLISH HIGHWAYS
'HE MAY HAVE DONE A LITTLE IN ALL THESE VOCATIONS MR
LOCKWOOD BUT I
COULDN'T GIVE MY WORD FOR ANY
I STATED BEFORE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HE
GAINED HIS MONEY NEITHER AM I AWARE OF THE MEANS HE TOOK TO RAISE HIS
MIND FROM THE SAVAGE IGNORANCE INTO WHICH IT WAS SUNK BUT WITH YOUR
LEAVE I'LL PROCEED IN MY OWN FASHION IF YOU THINK IT WILL AMUSE AND NOT
WEARY YOU
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER THIS MORNING
'MUCH
'THAT'S GOOD NEWS
I GOT MISS CATHERINE AND MYSELF TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE AND TO MY
AGREEABLE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE BEHAVED INFINITELY BETTER THAN I DARED TO
EXPECT
SHE SEEMED ALMOST OVER FOND OF MR
LINTON AND EVEN TO HIS
SISTER SHE SHOWED PLENTY OF AFFECTION
THEY WERE BOTH VERY ATTENTIVE TO
HER COMFORT CERTAINLY
IT WAS NOT THE THORN BENDING TO THE
HONEYSUCKLES BUT THE HONEYSUCKLES EMBRACING THE THORN
THERE WERE NO
MUTUAL CONCESSIONS ONE STOOD ERECT AND THE OTHERS YIELDED AND WHO CAN
BE ILL NATURED AND BAD TEMPERED WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER NEITHER OPPOSITION
NOR INDIFFERENCE I OBSERVED THAT MR
EDGAR HAD A DEEP ROOTED FEAR OF
RUFFLING HER HUMOUR
HE CONCEALED IT FROM HER BUT IF EVER HE HEARD ME
ANSWER SHARPLY OR SAW ANY OTHER SERVANT GROW CLOUDY AT SOME IMPERIOUS
ORDER OF HERS HE WOULD SHOW HIS TROUBLE BY A FROWN OF DISPLEASURE THAT
NEVER DARKENED ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
HE MANY A TIME SPOKE STERNLY TO ME
ABOUT MY PERTNESS AND AVERRED THAT THE STAB OF A KNIFE COULD NOT INFLICT
A WORSE PANG THAN HE SUFFERED AT SEEING HIS LADY VEXED
NOT TO GRIEVE A
KIND MASTER I LEARNED TO BE LESS TOUCHY AND FOR THE SPACE OF HALF A
YEAR THE GUNPOWDER LAY AS HARMLESS AS SAND BECAUSE NO FIRE CAME NEAR TO
EXPLODE IT
CATHERINE HAD SEASONS OF GLOOM AND SILENCE NOW AND THEN
THEY WERE RESPECTED WITH SYMPATHISING SILENCE BY HER HUSBAND WHO
ASCRIBED THEM TO AN ALTERATION IN HER CONSTITUTION PRODUCED BY HER
PERILOUS ILLNESS AS SHE WAS NEVER SUBJECT TO DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS
BEFORE
THE RETURN OF SUNSHINE WAS WELCOMED BY ANSWERING SUNSHINE FROM
HIM
I BELIEVE I MAY ASSERT THAT THEY WERE REALLY IN POSSESSION OF DEEP
AND GROWING HAPPINESS
IT ENDED
WELL WE MUST BE FOR OURSELVES IN THE LONG RUN THE MILD AND
GENEROUS ARE ONLY MORE JUSTLY SELFISH THAN THE DOMINEERING AND IT ENDED
WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSED EACH TO FEEL THAT THE ONE'S INTEREST WAS NOT
THE CHIEF CONSIDERATION IN THE OTHER'S THOUGHTS
ON A MELLOW EVENING IN
SEPTEMBER I WAS COMING FROM THE GARDEN WITH A HEAVY BASKET OF APPLES
WHICH I HAD BEEN GATHERING
IT HAD GOT DUSK AND THE MOON LOOKED OVER
THE HIGH WALL OF THE COURT CAUSING UNDEFINED SHADOWS TO LURK IN THE
CORNERS OF THE NUMEROUS PROJECTING PORTIONS OF THE BUILDING
I SET MY
BURDEN ON THE HOUSE STEPS BY THE KITCHEN DOOR AND LINGERED TO REST AND
DREW IN A FEW MORE BREATHS OF THE SOFT SWEET AIR MY EYES WERE ON THE
MOON AND MY BACK TO THE ENTRANCE WHEN I HEARD A VOICE BEHIND ME
SAY 'NELLY IS THAT YOU
IT WAS A DEEP VOICE AND FOREIGN IN TONE YET THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE
MANNER OF PRONOUNCING MY NAME WHICH MADE IT SOUND FAMILIAR
I TURNED
ABOUT TO DISCOVER WHO SPOKE FEARFULLY FOR THE DOORS WERE SHUT AND I
HAD SEEN NOBODY ON APPROACHING THE STEPS
SOMETHING STIRRED IN THE
PORCH AND MOVING NEARER I DISTINGUISHED A TALL MAN DRESSED IN DARK
CLOTHES WITH DARK FACE AND HAIR
HE LEANT AGAINST THE SIDE AND HELD
HIS FINGERS ON THE LATCH AS IF INTENDING TO OPEN FOR HIMSELF
'WHO CAN
IT BE I THOUGHT
'MR
EARNSHAW OH NO THE VOICE HAS NO RESEMBLANCE
TO HIS
'I HAVE WAITED HERE AN HOUR HE RESUMED WHILE I CONTINUED STARING 'AND
THE WHOLE OF THAT TIME ALL ROUND HAS BEEN AS STILL AS DEATH
I DARED NOT
ENTER
YOU DO NOT KNOW ME LOOK I'M NOT A STRANGER
A RAY FELL ON HIS FEATURES THE CHEEKS WERE SALLOW AND HALF COVERED WITH
BLACK WHISKERS THE BROWS LOWERING THE EYES DEEP SET AND SINGULAR
I
REMEMBERED THE EYES
'WHAT I CRIED UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO REGARD HIM AS A WORLDLY VISITOR
AND I RAISED MY HANDS IN AMAZEMENT
'WHAT YOU COME BACK IS IT REALLY
YOU IS IT
'YES HEATHCLIFF HE REPLIED GLANCING FROM ME UP TO THE WINDOWS WHICH
REFLECTED A SCORE OF GLITTERING MOONS BUT SHOWED NO LIGHTS FROM WITHIN
'ARE THEY AT HOME WHERE IS SHE NELLY YOU ARE NOT GLAD YOU NEEDN'T BE
SO DISTURBED
IS SHE HERE SPEAK I WANT TO HAVE ONE WORD WITH
HER YOUR MISTRESS
GO AND SAY SOME PERSON FROM GIMMERTON DESIRES TO
SEE HER
'HOW WILL SHE TAKE IT I EXCLAIMED
'WHAT WILL SHE DO THE SURPRISE
BEWILDERS ME IT WILL PUT HER OUT OF HER HEAD AND YOU ARE HEATHCLIFF
BUT ALTERED NAY THERE'S NO COMPREHENDING IT
HAVE YOU BEEN FOR A
SOLDIER
'GO AND CARRY MY MESSAGE HE INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY
'I'M IN HELL
TILL YOU DO
HE LIFTED THE LATCH AND I ENTERED BUT WHEN I GOT TO THE PARLOUR WHERE
MR
AND MRS
LINTON WERE I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO PROCEED
AT
LENGTH I RESOLVED ON MAKING AN EXCUSE TO ASK IF THEY WOULD HAVE THE
CANDLES LIGHTED AND I OPENED THE DOOR
THEY SAT TOGETHER IN A WINDOW WHOSE LATTICE LAY BACK AGAINST THE WALL
AND DISPLAYED BEYOND THE GARDEN TREES AND THE WILD GREEN PARK THE
VALLEY OF GIMMERTON WITH A LONG LINE OF MIST WINDING NEARLY TO ITS TOP
FOR VERY SOON AFTER YOU PASS THE CHAPEL AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THE
SOUGH THAT RUNS FROM THE MARSHES JOINS A BECK WHICH FOLLOWS THE BEND OF
THE GLEN
WUTHERING HEIGHTS ROSE ABOVE THIS SILVERY VAPOUR BUT OUR OLD
HOUSE WAS INVISIBLE IT RATHER DIPS DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE
BOTH THE
ROOM AND ITS OCCUPANTS AND THE SCENE THEY GAZED ON LOOKED WONDROUSLY
PEACEFUL
I SHRANK RELUCTANTLY FROM PERFORMING MY ERRAND AND WAS
ACTUALLY GOING AWAY LEAVING IT UNSAID AFTER HAVING PUT MY QUESTION ABOUT
THE CANDLES WHEN A SENSE OF MY FOLLY COMPELLED ME TO RETURN AND MUTTER
'A PERSON FROM GIMMERTON WISHES TO SEE YOU MA'AM
'WHAT DOES HE WANT ASKED MRS
LINTON
'I DID NOT QUESTION HIM I ANSWERED
'WELL CLOSE THE CURTAINS NELLY SHE SAID 'AND BRING UP TEA
I'LL BE
BACK AGAIN DIRECTLY
SHE QUITTED THE APARTMENT MR
EDGAR INQUIRED CARELESSLY WHO IT WAS
'SOME ONE MISTRESS DOES NOT EXPECT I REPLIED
'THAT HEATHCLIFF YOU
RECOLLECT HIM SIR WHO USED TO LIVE AT MR
EARNSHAW'S
'WHAT THE GIPSY THE PLOUGHBOY HE CRIED
'WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO TO
CATHERINE
'HUSH YOU MUST NOT CALL HIM BY THOSE NAMES MASTER I SAID
'SHE'D BE
SADLY GRIEVED TO HEAR YOU
SHE WAS NEARLY HEARTBROKEN WHEN HE RAN OFF
I
GUESS HIS RETURN WILL MAKE A JUBILEE TO HER
MR
LINTON WALKED TO A WINDOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THAT
OVERLOOKED THE COURT
HE UNFASTENED IT AND LEANT OUT
I SUPPOSE THEY
WERE BELOW FOR HE EXCLAIMED QUICKLY 'DON'T STAND THERE LOVE BRING
THE PERSON IN IF IT BE ANYONE PARTICULAR ERE LONG I HEARD THE CLICK
OF THE LATCH AND CATHERINE FLEW UP STAIRS BREATHLESS AND WILD TOO
EXCITED TO SHOW GLADNESS INDEED BY HER FACE YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE
SURMISED AN AWFUL CALAMITY
'OH EDGAR EDGAR SHE PANTED FLINGING HER ARMS ROUND HIS NECK
'OH
EDGAR DARLING HEATHCLIFF'S COME BACK HE IS AND SHE TIGHTENED HER
EMBRACE TO A SQUEEZE
'WELL WELL CRIED HER HUSBAND CROSSLY 'DON'T STRANGLE ME FOR THAT HE
NEVER STRUCK ME AS SUCH A MARVELLOUS TREASURE
THERE IS NO NEED TO BE
FRANTIC
'I KNOW YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM SHE ANSWERED REPRESSING A LITTLE THE
INTENSITY OF HER DELIGHT
'YET FOR MY SAKE YOU MUST BE FRIENDS NOW
SHALL I TELL HIM TO COME UP
'HERE HE SAID 'INTO THE PARLOUR
'WHERE ELSE SHE ASKED
HE LOOKED VEXED AND SUGGESTED THE KITCHEN AS A MORE SUITABLE PLACE FOR
HIM
MRS
LINTON EYED HIM WITH A DROLL EXPRESSION HALF ANGRY HALF
LAUGHING AT HIS FASTIDIOUSNESS
'NO SHE ADDED AFTER A WHILE 'I CANNOT SIT IN THE KITCHEN
SET TWO
TABLES HERE ELLEN ONE FOR YOUR MASTER AND MISS ISABELLA BEING GENTRY
THE OTHER FOR HEATHCLIFF AND MYSELF BEING OF THE LOWER ORDERS
WILL
THAT PLEASE YOU DEAR OR MUST I HAVE A FIRE LIGHTED ELSEWHERE IF SO
GIVE DIRECTIONS
I'LL RUN DOWN AND SECURE MY GUEST
I'M AFRAID THE JOY
IS TOO GREAT TO BE REAL
SHE WAS ABOUT TO DART OFF AGAIN BUT EDGAR ARRESTED HER
YOU BID HIM STEP UP HE SAID ADDRESSING ME 'AND CATHERINE TRY TO
BE GLAD WITHOUT BEING ABSURD
THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD NEED NOT WITNESS THE
SIGHT OF YOUR WELCOMING A RUNAWAY SERVANT AS A BROTHER
I DESCENDED AND FOUND HEATHCLIFF WAITING UNDER THE PORCH EVIDENTLY
ANTICIPATING AN INVITATION TO ENTER
HE FOLLOWED MY GUIDANCE WITHOUT
WASTE OF WORDS AND I USHERED HIM INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE MASTER AND
MISTRESS WHOSE FLUSHED CHEEKS BETRAYED SIGNS OF WARM TALKING
BUT THE
LADY'S GLOWED WITH ANOTHER FEELING WHEN HER FRIEND APPEARED AT THE DOOR
SHE SPRANG FORWARD TOOK BOTH HIS HANDS AND LED HIM TO LINTON AND THEN
SHE SEIZED LINTON'S RELUCTANT FINGERS AND CRUSHED THEM INTO HIS
NOW
FULLY REVEALED BY THE FIRE AND CANDLELIGHT I WAS AMAZED MORE THAN EVER
TO BEHOLD THE TRANSFORMATION OF HEATHCLIFF
HE HAD GROWN A TALL
ATHLETIC WELL FORMED MAN BESIDE WHOM MY MASTER SEEMED QUITE SLENDER AND
YOUTH LIKE
HIS UPRIGHT CARRIAGE SUGGESTED THE IDEA OF HIS HAVING BEEN
IN THE ARMY
HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MUCH OLDER IN EXPRESSION AND DECISION
OF FEATURE THAN MR
LINTON'S IT LOOKED INTELLIGENT AND RETAINED NO
MARKS OF FORMER DEGRADATION
A HALF CIVILISED FEROCITY LURKED YET IN THE
DEPRESSED BROWS AND EYES FULL OF BLACK FIRE BUT IT WAS SUBDUED AND HIS
MANNER WAS EVEN DIGNIFIED QUITE DIVESTED OF ROUGHNESS THOUGH STERN FOR
GRACE
MY MASTER'S SURPRISE EQUALLED OR EXCEEDED MINE HE REMAINED FOR A
MINUTE AT A LOSS HOW TO ADDRESS THE PLOUGHBOY AS HE HAD CALLED HIM
HEATHCLIFF DROPPED HIS SLIGHT HAND AND STOOD LOOKING AT HIM COOLLY TILL
HE CHOSE TO SPEAK
'SIT DOWN SIR HE SAID AT LENGTH
'MRS
LINTON RECALLING OLD TIMES
WOULD HAVE ME GIVE YOU A CORDIAL RECEPTION AND OF COURSE I AM
GRATIFIED WHEN ANYTHING OCCURS TO PLEASE HER
'AND I ALSO ANSWERED HEATHCLIFF 'ESPECIALLY IF IT BE ANYTHING IN WHICH
I HAVE A PART
I SHALL STAY AN HOUR OR TWO WILLINGLY
HE TOOK A SEAT OPPOSITE CATHERINE WHO KEPT HER GAZE FIXED ON HIM AS IF
SHE FEARED HE WOULD VANISH WERE SHE TO REMOVE IT
HE DID NOT RAISE HIS
TO HER OFTEN A QUICK GLANCE NOW AND THEN SUFFICED BUT IT FLASHED BACK
EACH TIME MORE CONFIDENTLY THE UNDISGUISED DELIGHT HE DRANK FROM HERS
THEY WERE TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN THEIR MUTUAL JOY TO SUFFER EMBARRASSMENT
NOT SO MR
EDGAR HE GREW PALE WITH PURE ANNOYANCE A FEELING THAT
REACHED ITS CLIMAX WHEN HIS LADY ROSE AND STEPPING ACROSS THE RUG
SEIZED HEATHCLIFF'S HANDS AGAIN AND LAUGHED LIKE ONE BESIDE HERSELF
'I SHALL THINK IT A DREAM TO MORROW SHE CRIED
'I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO
BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SEEN AND TOUCHED AND SPOKEN TO YOU ONCE MORE
AND
YET CRUEL HEATHCLIFF YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS WELCOME
TO BE ABSENT AND
SILENT FOR THREE YEARS AND NEVER TO THINK OF ME
'A LITTLE MORE THAN YOU HAVE THOUGHT OF ME HE MURMURED
'I HEARD OF
YOUR MARRIAGE CATHY NOT LONG SINCE AND WHILE WAITING IN THE YARD
BELOW I MEDITATED THIS PLAN JUST TO HAVE ONE GLIMPSE OF YOUR FACE A
STARE OF SURPRISE PERHAPS AND PRETENDED PLEASURE AFTERWARDS SETTLE MY
SCORE WITH HINDLEY AND THEN PREVENT THE LAW BY DOING EXECUTION ON
MYSELF
YOUR WELCOME HAS PUT THESE IDEAS OUT OF MY MIND BUT BEWARE OF
MEETING ME WITH ANOTHER ASPECT NEXT TIME NAY YOU'LL NOT DRIVE ME OFF
AGAIN
YOU WERE REALLY SORRY FOR ME WERE YOU WELL THERE WAS CAUSE
I'VE FOUGHT THROUGH A BITTER LIFE SINCE I LAST HEARD YOUR VOICE AND YOU
MUST FORGIVE ME FOR I STRUGGLED ONLY FOR YOU
'CATHERINE UNLESS WE ARE TO HAVE COLD TEA PLEASE TO COME TO THE TABLE
INTERRUPTED LINTON STRIVING TO PRESERVE HIS ORDINARY TONE AND A DUE
MEASURE OF POLITENESS
'MR
HEATHCLIFF WILL HAVE A LONG WALK WHEREVER
HE MAY LODGE TO NIGHT AND I'M THIRSTY
SHE TOOK HER POST BEFORE THE URN AND MISS ISABELLA CAME SUMMONED BY THE
BELL THEN HAVING HANDED THEIR CHAIRS FORWARD I LEFT THE ROOM
THE
MEAL HARDLY ENDURED TEN MINUTES
CATHERINE'S CUP WAS NEVER FILLED SHE
COULD NEITHER EAT NOR DRINK
EDGAR HAD MADE A SLOP IN HIS SAUCER AND
SCARCELY SWALLOWED A MOUTHFUL
THEIR GUEST DID NOT PROTRACT HIS STAY
THAT EVENING ABOVE AN HOUR LONGER
I ASKED AS HE DEPARTED IF HE WENT
TO GIMMERTON
'NO TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS HE ANSWERED 'MR
EARNSHAW INVITED ME WHEN I
CALLED THIS MORNING
MR
EARNSHAW INVITED HIM AND HE CALLED ON MR
EARNSHAW I PONDERED
THIS SENTENCE PAINFULLY AFTER HE WAS GONE
IS HE TURNING OUT A BIT OF A
HYPOCRITE AND COMING INTO THE COUNTRY TO WORK MISCHIEF UNDER A CLOAK I
MUSED I HAD A PRESENTIMENT IN THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART THAT HE HAD BETTER
HAVE REMAINED AWAY
ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I WAS WAKENED FROM MY FIRST NAP BY MRS
LINTON GLIDING INTO MY CHAMBER TAKING A SEAT ON MY BEDSIDE AND PULLING
ME BY THE HAIR TO ROUSE ME
'I CANNOT REST ELLEN SHE SAID BY WAY OF APOLOGY
'AND I WANT SOME
LIVING CREATURE TO KEEP ME COMPANY IN MY HAPPINESS EDGAR IS SULKY
BECAUSE I'M GLAD OF A THING THAT DOES NOT INTEREST HIM HE REFUSES TO
OPEN HIS MOUTH EXCEPT TO UTTER PETTISH SILLY SPEECHES AND HE AFFIRMED
I WAS CRUEL AND SELFISH FOR WISHING TO TALK WHEN HE WAS SO SICK AND
SLEEPY
HE ALWAYS CONTRIVES TO BE SICK AT THE LEAST CROSS I GAVE A FEW
SENTENCES OF COMMENDATION TO HEATHCLIFF AND HE EITHER FOR A HEADACHE OR
A PANG OF ENVY BEGAN TO CRY SO I GOT UP AND LEFT HIM
'WHAT USE IS IT PRAISING HEATHCLIFF TO HIM I ANSWERED
'AS LADS THEY
HAD AN AVERSION TO EACH OTHER AND HEATHCLIFF WOULD HATE JUST AS MUCH TO
HEAR HIM PRAISED IT'S HUMAN NATURE
LET MR
LINTON ALONE ABOUT HIM
UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE AN OPEN QUARREL BETWEEN THEM
'BUT DOES IT NOT SHOW GREAT WEAKNESS PURSUED SHE
'I'M NOT ENVIOUS I
NEVER FEEL HURT AT THE BRIGHTNESS OF ISABELLA'S YELLOW HAIR AND THE
WHITENESS OF HER SKIN AT HER DAINTY ELEGANCE AND THE FONDNESS ALL THE
FAMILY EXHIBIT FOR HER
EVEN YOU NELLY IF WE HAVE A DISPUTE SOMETIMES
YOU BACK ISABELLA AT ONCE AND I YIELD LIKE A FOOLISH MOTHER I CALL HER
A DARLING AND FLATTER HER INTO A GOOD TEMPER
IT PLEASES HER BROTHER TO
SEE US CORDIAL AND THAT PLEASES ME
BUT THEY ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THEY
ARE SPOILED CHILDREN AND FANCY THE WORLD WAS MADE FOR THEIR
ACCOMMODATION AND THOUGH I HUMOUR BOTH I THINK A SMART CHASTISEMENT
MIGHT IMPROVE THEM ALL THE SAME
'YOU'RE MISTAKEN MRS
LINTON SAID I
'THEY HUMOUR YOU I KNOW WHAT
THERE WOULD BE TO DO IF THEY DID NOT
YOU CAN WELL AFFORD TO INDULGE
THEIR PASSING WHIMS AS LONG AS THEIR BUSINESS IS TO ANTICIPATE ALL YOUR
DESIRES
YOU MAY HOWEVER FALL OUT AT LAST OVER SOMETHING OF EQUAL
CONSEQUENCE TO BOTH SIDES AND THEN THOSE YOU TERM WEAK ARE VERY CAPABLE
OF BEING AS OBSTINATE AS YOU
'AND THEN WE SHALL FIGHT TO THE DEATH SHA'N'T WE NELLY SHE RETURNED
LAUGHING
'NO I TELL YOU I HAVE SUCH FAITH IN LINTON'S LOVE THAT I
BELIEVE I MIGHT KILL HIM AND HE WOULDN'T WISH TO RETALIATE
I ADVISED HER TO VALUE HIM THE MORE FOR HIS AFFECTION
'I DO SHE ANSWERED 'BUT HE NEEDN'T RESORT TO WHINING FOR TRIFLES
IT
IS CHILDISH AND INSTEAD OF MELTING INTO TEARS BECAUSE I SAID THAT
HEATHCLIFF WAS NOW WORTHY OF ANYONE'S REGARD AND IT WOULD HONOUR THE
FIRST GENTLEMAN IN THE COUNTRY TO BE HIS FRIEND HE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID IT
FOR ME AND BEEN DELIGHTED FROM SYMPATHY
HE MUST GET ACCUSTOMED TO HIM
AND HE MAY AS WELL LIKE HIM CONSIDERING HOW HEATHCLIFF HAS REASON TO
OBJECT TO HIM I'M SURE HE BEHAVED EXCELLENTLY
'WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS GOING TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS I INQUIRED
'HE
IS REFORMED IN EVERY RESPECT APPARENTLY QUITE A CHRISTIAN OFFERING THE
RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP TO HIS ENEMIES ALL AROUND
'HE EXPLAINED IT SHE REPLIED
'I WONDER AS MUCH AS YOU
HE SAID HE
CALLED TO GATHER INFORMATION CONCERNING ME FROM YOU SUPPOSING YOU
RESIDED THERE STILL AND JOSEPH TOLD HINDLEY WHO CAME OUT AND FELL TO
QUESTIONING HIM OF WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING AND HOW HE HAD BEEN LIVING
AND FINALLY DESIRED HIM TO WALK IN
THERE WERE SOME PERSONS SITTING AT
CARDS HEATHCLIFF JOINED THEM MY BROTHER LOST SOME MONEY TO HIM AND
FINDING HIM PLENTIFULLY SUPPLIED HE REQUESTED THAT HE WOULD COME AGAIN
IN THE EVENING TO WHICH HE CONSENTED
HINDLEY IS TOO RECKLESS TO SELECT
HIS ACQUAINTANCE PRUDENTLY HE DOESN'T TROUBLE HIMSELF TO REFLECT ON THE
CAUSES HE MIGHT HAVE FOR MISTRUSTING ONE WHOM HE HAS BASELY INJURED
BUT
HEATHCLIFF AFFIRMS HIS PRINCIPAL REASON FOR RESUMING A CONNECTION WITH
HIS ANCIENT PERSECUTOR IS A WISH TO INSTALL HIMSELF IN QUARTERS AT WALKING
DISTANCE FROM THE GRANGE AND AN ATTACHMENT TO THE HOUSE WHERE WE LIVED
TOGETHER AND LIKEWISE A HOPE THAT I SHALL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES OF
SEEING HIM THERE THAN I COULD HAVE IF HE SETTLED IN GIMMERTON
HE MEANS
TO OFFER LIBERAL PAYMENT FOR PERMISSION TO LODGE AT THE HEIGHTS AND
DOUBTLESS MY BROTHER'S COVETOUSNESS WILL PROMPT HIM TO ACCEPT THE TERMS
HE WAS ALWAYS GREEDY THOUGH WHAT HE GRASPS WITH ONE HAND HE FLINGS AWAY
WITH THE OTHER
'IT'S A NICE PLACE FOR A YOUNG MAN TO FIX HIS DWELLING IN SAID I
'HAVE
YOU NO FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES MRS
LINTON
'NONE FOR MY FRIEND SHE REPLIED 'HIS STRONG HEAD WILL KEEP HIM FROM
DANGER A LITTLE FOR HINDLEY BUT HE CAN'T BE MADE MORALLY WORSE THAN HE
IS AND I STAND BETWEEN HIM AND BODILY HARM
THE EVENT OF THIS EVENING
HAS RECONCILED ME TO GOD AND HUMANITY I HAD RISEN IN ANGRY REBELLION
AGAINST PROVIDENCE
OH I'VE ENDURED VERY VERY BITTER MISERY NELLY IF
THAT CREATURE KNEW HOW BITTER HE'D BE ASHAMED TO CLOUD ITS REMOVAL WITH
IDLE PETULANCE
IT WAS KINDNESS FOR HIM WHICH INDUCED ME TO BEAR IT
ALONE HAD I EXPRESSED THE AGONY I FREQUENTLY FELT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
TAUGHT TO LONG FOR ITS ALLEVIATION AS ARDENTLY AS I
HOWEVER IT'S OVER
AND I'LL TAKE NO REVENGE ON HIS FOLLY I CAN AFFORD TO SUFFER ANYTHING
HEREAFTER SHOULD THE MEANEST THING ALIVE SLAP ME ON THE CHEEK I'D NOT
ONLY TURN THE OTHER BUT I'D ASK PARDON FOR PROVOKING IT AND AS A
PROOF I'LL GO MAKE MY PEACE WITH EDGAR INSTANTLY
GOOD NIGHT I'M AN
ANGEL
IN THIS SELF COMPLACENT CONVICTION SHE DEPARTED AND THE SUCCESS OF HER
FULFILLED RESOLUTION WAS OBVIOUS ON THE MORROW MR
LINTON HAD NOT ONLY
ABJURED HIS PEEVISHNESS THOUGH HIS SPIRITS SEEMED STILL SUBDUED BY
CATHERINE'S EXUBERANCE OF VIVACITY BUT HE VENTURED NO OBJECTION TO HER
TAKING ISABELLA WITH HER TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS IN THE AFTERNOON AND SHE
REWARDED HIM WITH SUCH A SUMMER OF SWEETNESS AND AFFECTION IN RETURN AS
MADE THE HOUSE A PARADISE FOR SEVERAL DAYS BOTH MASTER AND SERVANTS
PROFITING FROM THE PERPETUAL SUNSHINE
HEATHCLIFF MR
HEATHCLIFF I SHOULD SAY IN FUTURE USED THE LIBERTY OF
VISITING AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE CAUTIOUSLY AT FIRST HE SEEMED ESTIMATING
HOW FAR ITS OWNER WOULD BEAR HIS INTRUSION
CATHERINE ALSO DEEMED IT
JUDICIOUS TO MODERATE HER EXPRESSIONS OF PLEASURE IN RECEIVING HIM AND
HE GRADUALLY ESTABLISHED HIS RIGHT TO BE EXPECTED
HE RETAINED A GREAT
DEAL OF THE RESERVE FOR WHICH HIS BOYHOOD WAS REMARKABLE AND THAT SERVED
TO REPRESS ALL STARTLING DEMONSTRATIONS OF FEELING
MY MASTER'S
UNEASINESS EXPERIENCED A LULL AND FURTHER CIRCUMSTANCES DIVERTED IT INTO
ANOTHER CHANNEL FOR A SPACE
HIS NEW SOURCE OF TROUBLE SPRANG FROM THE NOT ANTICIPATED MISFORTUNE OF
ISABELLA LINTON EVINCING A SUDDEN AND IRRESISTIBLE ATTRACTION TOWARDS THE
TOLERATED GUEST
SHE WAS AT THAT TIME A CHARMING YOUNG LADY OF EIGHTEEN
INFANTILE IN MANNERS THOUGH POSSESSED OF KEEN WIT KEEN FEELINGS AND A
KEEN TEMPER TOO IF IRRITATED
HER BROTHER WHO LOVED HER TENDERLY WAS
APPALLED AT THIS FANTASTIC PREFERENCE
LEAVING ASIDE THE DEGRADATION OF
AN ALLIANCE WITH A NAMELESS MAN AND THE POSSIBLE FACT THAT HIS PROPERTY
IN DEFAULT OF HEIRS MALE MIGHT PASS INTO SUCH A ONE'S POWER HE HAD
SENSE TO COMPREHEND HEATHCLIFF'S DISPOSITION TO KNOW THAT THOUGH HIS
EXTERIOR WAS ALTERED HIS MIND WAS UNCHANGEABLE AND UNCHANGED
AND HE
DREADED THAT MIND IT REVOLTED HIM HE SHRANK FOREBODINGLY FROM THE IDEA
OF COMMITTING ISABELLA TO ITS KEEPING
HE WOULD HAVE RECOILED STILL MORE
HAD HE BEEN AWARE THAT HER ATTACHMENT ROSE UNSOLICITED AND WAS BESTOWED
WHERE IT AWAKENED NO RECIPROCATION OF SENTIMENT FOR THE MINUTE HE
DISCOVERED ITS EXISTENCE HE LAID THE BLAME ON HEATHCLIFF'S DELIBERATE
DESIGNING
WE HAD ALL REMARKED DURING SOME TIME THAT MISS LINTON FRETTED AND PINED
OVER SOMETHING
SHE GREW CROSS AND WEARISOME SNAPPING AT AND TEASING
CATHERINE CONTINUALLY AT THE IMMINENT RISK OF EXHAUSTING HER LIMITED
PATIENCE
WE EXCUSED HER TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ON THE PLEA OF
ILL HEALTH SHE WAS DWINDLING AND FADING BEFORE OUR EYES
BUT ONE DAY
WHEN SHE HAD BEEN PECULIARLY WAYWARD REJECTING HER BREAKFAST
COMPLAINING THAT THE SERVANTS DID NOT DO WHAT SHE TOLD THEM THAT THE
MISTRESS WOULD ALLOW HER TO BE NOTHING IN THE HOUSE AND EDGAR NEGLECTED
HER THAT SHE HAD CAUGHT A COLD WITH THE DOORS BEING LEFT OPEN AND WE
LET THE PARLOUR FIRE GO OUT ON PURPOSE TO VEX HER WITH A HUNDRED YET
MORE FRIVOLOUS ACCUSATIONS MRS
LINTON PEREMPTORILY INSISTED THAT SHE
SHOULD GET TO BED AND HAVING SCOLDED HER HEARTILY THREATENED TO SEND
FOR THE DOCTOR
MENTION OF KENNETH CAUSED HER TO EXCLAIM INSTANTLY
THAT HER HEALTH WAS PERFECT AND IT WAS ONLY CATHERINE'S HARSHNESS WHICH
MADE HER UNHAPPY
'HOW CAN YOU SAY I AM HARSH YOU NAUGHTY FONDLING CRIED THE MISTRESS
AMAZED AT THE UNREASONABLE ASSERTION
'YOU ARE SURELY LOSING YOUR
REASON
WHEN HAVE I BEEN HARSH TELL ME
'YESTERDAY SOBBED ISABELLA 'AND NOW
'YESTERDAY SAID HER SISTER IN LAW
'ON WHAT OCCASION
'IN OUR WALK ALONG THE MOOR YOU TOLD ME TO RAMBLE WHERE I PLEASED WHILE
YOU SAUNTERED ON WITH MR
HEATHCLIFF
'AND THAT'S YOUR NOTION OF HARSHNESS SAID CATHERINE LAUGHING
'IT WAS
NO HINT THAT YOUR COMPANY WAS SUPERFLUOUS WE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER YOU
KEPT WITH US OR NOT I MERELY THOUGHT HEATHCLIFF'S TALK WOULD HAVE
NOTHING ENTERTAINING FOR YOUR EARS
'OH NO WEPT THE YOUNG LADY 'YOU WISHED ME AWAY BECAUSE YOU KNEW I
LIKED TO BE THERE
'IS SHE SANE ASKED MRS
LINTON APPEALING TO ME
'I'LL REPEAT OUR
CONVERSATION WORD FOR WORD ISABELLA AND YOU POINT OUT ANY CHARM IT
COULD HAVE HAD FOR YOU
'I DON'T MIND THE CONVERSATION SHE ANSWERED 'I WANTED TO BE WITH
'WELL SAID CATHERINE PERCEIVING HER HESITATE TO COMPLETE THE SENTENCE
'WITH HIM AND I WON'T BE ALWAYS SENT OFF SHE CONTINUED KINDLING UP
'YOU ARE A DOG IN THE MANGER CATHY AND DESIRE NO ONE TO BE LOVED BUT
YOURSELF
'YOU ARE AN IMPERTINENT LITTLE MONKEY EXCLAIMED MRS
LINTON IN
SURPRISE
'BUT I'LL NOT BELIEVE THIS IDIOTCY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU
CAN COVET THE ADMIRATION OF HEATHCLIFF THAT YOU CONSIDER HIM AN
AGREEABLE PERSON I HOPE I HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD YOU ISABELLA
'NO YOU HAVE NOT SAID THE INFATUATED GIRL
'I LOVE HIM MORE THAN EVER
YOU LOVED EDGAR AND HE MIGHT LOVE ME IF YOU WOULD LET HIM
'I WOULDN'T BE YOU FOR A KINGDOM THEN CATHERINE DECLARED
EMPHATICALLY AND SHE SEEMED TO SPEAK SINCERELY
'NELLY HELP ME TO
CONVINCE HER OF HER MADNESS
TELL HER WHAT HEATHCLIFF IS AN UNRECLAIMED
CREATURE WITHOUT REFINEMENT WITHOUT CULTIVATION AN ARID WILDERNESS OF
FURZE AND WHINSTONE
I'D AS SOON PUT THAT LITTLE CANARY INTO THE PARK ON
A WINTER'S DAY AS RECOMMEND YOU TO BESTOW YOUR HEART ON HIM IT IS
DEPLORABLE IGNORANCE OF HIS CHARACTER CHILD AND NOTHING ELSE WHICH
MAKES THAT DREAM ENTER YOUR HEAD
PRAY DON'T IMAGINE THAT HE CONCEALS
DEPTHS OF BENEVOLENCE AND AFFECTION BENEATH A STERN EXTERIOR HE'S NOT A
ROUGH DIAMOND A PEARL CONTAINING OYSTER OF A RUSTIC HE'S A FIERCE
PITILESS WOLFISH MAN
I NEVER SAY TO HIM LET THIS OR THAT ENEMY
ALONE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE UNGENEROUS OR CRUEL TO HARM THEM I SAY LET
THEM ALONE BECAUSE I SHOULD HATE THEM TO BE WRONGED AND HE'D CRUSH
YOU LIKE A SPARROW'S EGG ISABELLA IF HE FOUND YOU A TROUBLESOME CHARGE
I KNOW HE COULDN'T LOVE A LINTON AND YET HE'D BE QUITE CAPABLE OF
MARRYING YOUR FORTUNE AND EXPECTATIONS AVARICE IS GROWING WITH HIM A
BESETTING SIN
THERE'S MY PICTURE AND I'M HIS FRIEND SO MUCH SO THAT
HAD HE THOUGHT SERIOUSLY TO CATCH YOU I SHOULD PERHAPS HAVE HELD MY
TONGUE AND LET YOU FALL INTO HIS TRAP
MISS LINTON REGARDED HER SISTER IN LAW WITH INDIGNATION
'FOR SHAME FOR SHAME SHE REPEATED ANGRILY
'YOU ARE WORSE THAN
TWENTY FOES YOU POISONOUS FRIEND
'AH YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME THEN SAID CATHERINE
'YOU THINK I SPEAK
FROM WICKED SELFISHNESS
'I'M CERTAIN YOU DO RETORTED ISABELLA 'AND I SHUDDER AT YOU
'GOOD CRIED THE OTHER
'TRY FOR YOURSELF IF THAT BE YOUR SPIRIT I
HAVE DONE AND YIELD THE ARGUMENT TO YOUR SAUCY INSOLENCE
'AND I MUST SUFFER FOR HER EGOTISM SHE SOBBED AS MRS
LINTON LEFT THE
ROOM
'ALL ALL IS AGAINST ME SHE HAS BLIGHTED MY SINGLE CONSOLATION
BUT SHE UTTERED FALSEHOODS DIDN'T SHE MR
HEATHCLIFF IS NOT A FIEND
HE HAS AN HONOURABLE SOUL AND A TRUE ONE OR HOW COULD HE REMEMBER HER
'BANISH HIM FROM YOUR THOUGHTS MISS I SAID
'HE'S A BIRD OF BAD OMEN
NO MATE FOR YOU
MRS
LINTON SPOKE STRONGLY AND YET I CAN'T CONTRADICT
HER
SHE IS BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HIS HEART THAN I OR ANY ONE BESIDES
AND SHE NEVER WOULD REPRESENT HIM AS WORSE THAN HE IS
HONEST PEOPLE
DON'T HIDE THEIR DEEDS
HOW HAS HE BEEN LIVING HOW HAS HE GOT RICH WHY
IS HE STAYING AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS THE HOUSE OF A MAN WHOM HE ABHORS
THEY SAY MR
EARNSHAW IS WORSE AND WORSE SINCE HE CAME

RUNS INTO HIS POCKET AND HER FATHUR'S SON GALLOPS DOWN T' BROAD ROAD
WHILE HE FLEES AFORE TO OPPEN T' PIKES NOW MISS LINTON JOSEPH IS AN
OLD RASCAL BUT NO LIAR AND IF HIS ACCOUNT OF HEATHCLIFF'S CONDUCT BE
TRUE YOU WOULD NEVER THINK OF DESIRING SUCH A HUSBAND WOULD YOU
'YOU ARE LEAGUED WITH THE REST ELLEN SHE REPLIED
'I'LL NOT LISTEN TO
YOUR SLANDERS
WHAT MALEVOLENCE YOU MUST HAVE TO WISH TO CONVINCE ME
THAT THERE IS NO HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD
WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE GOT OVER THIS FANCY IF LEFT TO HERSELF OR
PERSEVERED IN NURSING IT PERPETUALLY I CANNOT SAY SHE HAD LITTLE TIME
TO REFLECT
THE DAY AFTER THERE WAS A JUSTICE MEETING AT THE NEXT TOWN
MY MASTER WAS OBLIGED TO ATTEND AND MR
HEATHCLIFF AWARE OF HIS
ABSENCE CALLED RATHER EARLIER THAN USUAL
CATHERINE AND ISABELLA WERE
SITTING IN THE LIBRARY ON HOSTILE TERMS BUT SILENT THE LATTER ALARMED
AT HER RECENT INDISCRETION AND THE DISCLOSURE SHE HAD MADE OF HER SECRET
FEELINGS IN A TRANSIENT FIT OF PASSION THE FORMER ON MATURE
CONSIDERATION REALLY OFFENDED WITH HER COMPANION AND IF SHE LAUGHED
AGAIN AT HER PERTNESS INCLINED TO MAKE IT NO LAUGHING MATTER TO HER
SHE
DID LAUGH AS SHE SAW HEATHCLIFF PASS THE WINDOW
I WAS SWEEPING THE
HEARTH AND I NOTICED A MISCHIEVOUS SMILE ON HER LIPS
ISABELLA
ABSORBED IN HER MEDITATIONS OR A BOOK REMAINED TILL THE DOOR OPENED
AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO ATTEMPT AN ESCAPE WHICH SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE
DONE HAD IT BEEN PRACTICABLE
'COME IN THAT'S RIGHT EXCLAIMED THE MISTRESS GAILY PULLING A CHAIR
TO THE FIRE
'HERE ARE TWO PEOPLE SADLY IN NEED OF A THIRD TO THAW THE
ICE BETWEEN THEM AND YOU ARE THE VERY ONE WE SHOULD BOTH OF US CHOOSE
HEATHCLIFF I'M PROUD TO SHOW YOU AT LAST SOMEBODY THAT DOTES ON YOU
MORE THAN MYSELF
I EXPECT YOU TO FEEL FLATTERED
NAY IT'S NOT NELLY
DON'T LOOK AT HER MY POOR LITTLE SISTER IN LAW IS BREAKING HER HEART BY
MERE CONTEMPLATION OF YOUR PHYSICAL AND MORAL BEAUTY
IT LIES IN YOUR
OWN POWER TO BE EDGAR'S BROTHER NO NO ISABELLA YOU SHA'N'T RUN OFF
SHE CONTINUED ARRESTING WITH FEIGNED PLAYFULNESS THE CONFOUNDED GIRL
WHO HAD RISEN INDIGNANTLY
'WE WERE QUARRELLING LIKE CATS ABOUT YOU
HEATHCLIFF AND I WAS FAIRLY BEATEN IN PROTESTATIONS OF DEVOTION AND
ADMIRATION AND MOREOVER I WAS INFORMED THAT IF I WOULD BUT HAVE THE
MANNERS TO STAND ASIDE MY RIVAL AS SHE WILL HAVE HERSELF TO BE WOULD
SHOOT A SHAFT INTO YOUR SOUL THAT WOULD FIX YOU FOR EVER AND SEND MY
IMAGE INTO ETERNAL OBLIVION
'CATHERINE SAID ISABELLA CALLING UP HER DIGNITY AND DISDAINING TO
STRUGGLE FROM THE TIGHT GRASP THAT HELD HER 'I'D THANK YOU TO ADHERE TO
THE TRUTH AND NOT SLANDER ME EVEN IN JOKE MR
HEATHCLIFF BE KIND
ENOUGH TO BID THIS FRIEND OF YOURS RELEASE ME SHE FORGETS THAT YOU AND I
ARE NOT INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES AND WHAT AMUSES HER IS PAINFUL TO ME
BEYOND EXPRESSION
AS THE GUEST ANSWERED NOTHING BUT TOOK HIS SEAT AND LOOKED THOROUGHLY
INDIFFERENT WHAT SENTIMENTS SHE CHERISHED CONCERNING HIM SHE TURNED AND
WHISPERED AN EARNEST APPEAL FOR LIBERTY TO HER TORMENTOR
'BY NO MEANS CRIED MRS
LINTON IN ANSWER
'I WON'T BE NAMED A DOG IN
THE MANGER AGAIN
YOU SHALL STAY NOW THEN HEATHCLIFF WHY DON'T YOU
EVINCE SATISFACTION AT MY PLEASANT NEWS ISABELLA SWEARS THAT THE LOVE
EDGAR HAS FOR ME IS NOTHING TO THAT SHE ENTERTAINS FOR YOU
I'M SURE SHE
MADE SOME SPEECH OF THE KIND DID SHE NOT ELLEN AND SHE HAS FASTED
EVER SINCE THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY'S WALK FROM SORROW AND RAGE THAT I
DESPATCHED HER OUT OF YOUR SOCIETY UNDER THE IDEA OF ITS BEING
UNACCEPTABLE
'I THINK YOU BELIE HER SAID HEATHCLIFF TWISTING HIS CHAIR TO FACE
THEM
'SHE WISHES TO BE OUT OF MY SOCIETY NOW AT ANY RATE
AND HE STARED HARD AT THE OBJECT OF DISCOURSE AS ONE MIGHT DO AT A
STRANGE REPULSIVE ANIMAL A CENTIPEDE FROM THE INDIES FOR INSTANCE
WHICH CURIOSITY LEADS ONE TO EXAMINE IN SPITE OF THE AVERSION IT RAISES
THE POOR THING COULDN'T BEAR THAT SHE GREW WHITE AND RED IN RAPID
SUCCESSION AND WHILE TEARS BEADED HER LASHES BENT THE STRENGTH OF HER
SMALL FINGERS TO LOOSEN THE FIRM CLUTCH OF CATHERINE AND PERCEIVING THAT
AS FAST AS SHE RAISED ONE FINGER OFF HER ARM ANOTHER CLOSED DOWN AND SHE
COULD NOT REMOVE THE WHOLE TOGETHER SHE BEGAN TO MAKE USE OF HER NAILS
AND THEIR SHARPNESS PRESENTLY ORNAMENTED THE DETAINER'S WITH CRESCENTS OF
RED
'THERE'S A TIGRESS EXCLAIMED MRS
LINTON SETTING HER FREE AND SHAKING
HER HAND WITH PAIN
'BEGONE FOR GOD'S SAKE AND HIDE YOUR VIXEN FACE
HOW FOOLISH TO REVEAL THOSE TALONS TO HIM
CAN'T YOU FANCY THE
CONCLUSIONS HE'LL DRAW LOOK HEATHCLIFF THEY ARE INSTRUMENTS THAT WILL
DO EXECUTION YOU MUST BEWARE OF YOUR EYES
'I'D WRENCH THEM OFF HER FINGERS IF THEY EVER MENACED ME HE ANSWERED
BRUTALLY WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AFTER HER
'BUT WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY
TEASING THE CREATURE IN THAT MANNER CATHY YOU WERE NOT SPEAKING THE
TRUTH WERE YOU
'I ASSURE YOU I WAS SHE RETURNED
'SHE HAS BEEN DYING FOR YOUR SAKE
SEVERAL WEEKS AND RAVING ABOUT YOU THIS MORNING AND POURING FORTH A
DELUGE OF ABUSE BECAUSE I REPRESENTED YOUR FAILINGS IN A PLAIN LIGHT
FOR THE PURPOSE OF MITIGATING HER ADORATION
BUT DON'T NOTICE IT
FURTHER I WISHED TO PUNISH HER SAUCINESS THAT'S ALL
I LIKE HER TOO
WELL MY DEAR HEATHCLIFF TO LET YOU ABSOLUTELY SEIZE AND DEVOUR HER UP
'AND I LIKE HER TOO ILL TO ATTEMPT IT SAID HE 'EXCEPT IN A VERY
GHOULISH FASHION
YOU'D HEAR OF ODD THINGS IF I LIVED ALONE WITH THAT
MAWKISH WAXEN FACE THE MOST ORDINARY WOULD BE PAINTING ON ITS WHITE THE
COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW AND TURNING THE BLUE EYES BLACK EVERY DAY OR
TWO THEY DETESTABLY RESEMBLE LINTON'S
'DELECTABLY OBSERVED CATHERINE
'THEY ARE DOVE'S EYES ANGEL'S
'SHE'S HER BROTHER'S HEIR IS SHE NOT HE ASKED AFTER A BRIEF SILENCE
'I SHOULD BE SORRY TO THINK SO RETURNED HIS COMPANION
'HALF A DOZEN
NEPHEWS SHALL ERASE HER TITLE PLEASE HEAVEN ABSTRACT YOUR MIND FROM
THE SUBJECT AT PRESENT YOU ARE TOO PRONE TO COVET YOUR NEIGHBOUR'S
GOODS REMEMBER THIS NEIGHBOUR'S GOODS ARE MINE
'IF THEY WERE MINE THEY WOULD BE NONE THE LESS THAT SAID HEATHCLIFF
'BUT THOUGH ISABELLA LINTON MAY BE SILLY SHE IS SCARCELY MAD AND IN
SHORT WE'LL DISMISS THE MATTER AS YOU ADVISE
FROM THEIR TONGUES THEY DID DISMISS IT AND CATHERINE PROBABLY FROM HER
THOUGHTS
THE OTHER I FELT CERTAIN RECALLED IT OFTEN IN THE COURSE OF
THE EVENING
I SAW HIM SMILE TO HIMSELF GRIN RATHER AND LAPSE INTO
OMINOUS MUSING WHENEVER MRS
LINTON HAD OCCASION TO BE ABSENT FROM THE
APARTMENT
I DETERMINED TO WATCH HIS MOVEMENTS
MY HEART INVARIABLY CLEAVED TO THE
MASTER'S IN PREFERENCE TO CATHERINE'S SIDE WITH REASON I IMAGINED FOR
HE WAS KIND AND TRUSTFUL AND HONOURABLE AND SHE SHE COULD NOT BE
CALLED OPPOSITE YET SHE SEEMED TO ALLOW HERSELF SUCH WIDE LATITUDE
THAT I HAD LITTLE FAITH IN HER PRINCIPLES AND STILL LESS SYMPATHY FOR
HER FEELINGS
I WANTED SOMETHING TO HAPPEN WHICH MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT
OF FREEING BOTH WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND THE GRANGE OF MR
HEATHCLIFF
QUIETLY LEAVING US AS WE HAD BEEN PRIOR TO HIS ADVENT
HIS VISITS WERE
A CONTINUAL NIGHTMARE TO ME AND I SUSPECTED TO MY MASTER ALSO
HIS
ABODE AT THE HEIGHTS WAS AN OPPRESSION PAST EXPLAINING
I FELT THAT GOD
HAD FORSAKEN THE STRAY SHEEP THERE TO ITS OWN WICKED WANDERINGS AND AN
EVIL BEAST PROWLED BETWEEN IT AND THE FOLD WAITING HIS TIME TO SPRING
AND DESTROY
CHAPTER XI
SOMETIMES WHILE MEDITATING ON THESE THINGS IN SOLITUDE I'VE GOT UP IN A
SUDDEN TERROR AND PUT ON MY BONNET TO GO SEE HOW ALL WAS AT THE FARM
I'VE PERSUADED MY CONSCIENCE THAT IT WAS A DUTY TO WARN HIM HOW PEOPLE
TALKED REGARDING HIS WAYS AND THEN I'VE RECOLLECTED HIS CONFIRMED BAD
HABITS AND HOPELESS OF BENEFITING HIM HAVE FLINCHED FROM RE ENTERING
THE DISMAL HOUSE DOUBTING IF I COULD BEAR TO BE TAKEN AT MY WORD
ONE TIME I PASSED THE OLD GATE GOING OUT OF MY WAY ON A JOURNEY TO
GIMMERTON
IT WAS ABOUT THE PERIOD THAT MY NARRATIVE HAS REACHED A
BRIGHT FROSTY AFTERNOON THE GROUND BARE AND THE ROAD HARD AND DRY
I
CAME TO A STONE WHERE THE HIGHWAY BRANCHES OFF ON TO THE MOOR AT YOUR
LEFT HAND A ROUGH SAND PILLAR WITH THE LETTERS W
H
CUT ON ITS NORTH
SIDE ON THE EAST G AND ON THE SOUTH WEST T
G
IT SERVES AS A
GUIDE POST TO THE GRANGE THE HEIGHTS AND VILLAGE
THE SUN SHONE YELLOW
ON ITS GREY HEAD REMINDING ME OF SUMMER AND I CANNOT SAY WHY BUT ALL
AT ONCE A GUSH OF CHILD'S SENSATIONS FLOWED INTO MY HEART
HINDLEY AND I
HELD IT A FAVOURITE SPOT TWENTY YEARS BEFORE
I GAZED LONG AT THE
WEATHER WORN BLOCK AND STOOPING DOWN PERCEIVED A HOLE NEAR THE BOTTOM
STILL FULL OF SNAIL SHELLS AND PEBBLES WHICH WE WERE FOND OF STORING
THERE WITH MORE PERISHABLE THINGS AND AS FRESH AS REALITY IT APPEARED
THAT I BEHELD MY EARLY PLAYMATE SEATED ON THE WITHERED TURF HIS DARK
SQUARE HEAD BENT FORWARD AND HIS LITTLE HAND SCOOPING OUT THE EARTH
WITH A PIECE OF SLATE
'POOR HINDLEY I EXCLAIMED INVOLUNTARILY
I
STARTED MY BODILY EYE WAS CHEATED INTO A MOMENTARY BELIEF THAT THE
CHILD LIFTED ITS FACE AND STARED STRAIGHT INTO MINE IT VANISHED IN A
TWINKLING BUT IMMEDIATELY I FELT AN IRRESISTIBLE YEARNING TO BE AT THE
HEIGHTS
SUPERSTITION URGED ME TO COMPLY WITH THIS IMPULSE SUPPOSING HE
SHOULD BE DEAD I THOUGHT OR SHOULD DIE SOON SUPPOSING IT WERE A SIGN
OF DEATH THE NEARER I GOT TO THE HOUSE THE MORE AGITATED I GREW AND ON
CATCHING SIGHT OF IT I TREMBLED IN EVERY LIMB
THE APPARITION HAD
OUTSTRIPPED ME IT STOOD LOOKING THROUGH THE GATE
THAT WAS MY FIRST
IDEA ON OBSERVING AN ELF LOCKED BROWN EYED BOY SETTING HIS RUDDY
COUNTENANCE AGAINST THE BARS
FURTHER REFLECTION SUGGESTED THIS MUST BE
HARETON MY HARETON NOT ALTERED GREATLY SINCE I LEFT HIM TEN MONTHS
SINCE
'GOD BLESS THEE DARLING I CRIED FORGETTING INSTANTANEOUSLY MY
FOOLISH FEARS
'HARETON IT'S NELLY NELLY THY NURSE
HE RETREATED OUT OF ARM'S LENGTH AND PICKED UP A LARGE FLINT
'I AM COME TO SEE THY FATHER HARETON I ADDED GUESSING FROM THE
ACTION THAT NELLY IF SHE LIVED IN HIS MEMORY AT ALL WAS NOT RECOGNISED
AS ONE WITH ME
HE RAISED HIS MISSILE TO HURL IT I COMMENCED A SOOTHING SPEECH BUT
COULD NOT STAY HIS HAND THE STONE STRUCK MY BONNET AND THEN ENSUED
FROM THE STAMMERING LIPS OF THE LITTLE FELLOW A STRING OF CURSES WHICH
WHETHER HE COMPREHENDED THEM OR NOT WERE DELIVERED WITH PRACTISED
EMPHASIS AND DISTORTED HIS BABY FEATURES INTO A SHOCKING EXPRESSION OF
MALIGNITY
YOU MAY BE CERTAIN THIS GRIEVED MORE THAN ANGERED ME
FIT TO
CRY I TOOK AN ORANGE FROM MY POCKET AND OFFERED IT TO PROPITIATE HIM
HE HESITATED AND THEN SNATCHED IT FROM MY HOLD AS IF HE FANCIED I ONLY
INTENDED TO TEMPT AND DISAPPOINT HIM
I SHOWED ANOTHER KEEPING IT OUT
OF HIS REACH
'WHO HAS TAUGHT YOU THOSE FINE WORDS MY BAIRN I INQUIRED
'THE
CURATE
'DAMN THE CURATE AND THEE GIE ME THAT HE REPLIED
'TELL US WHERE YOU GOT YOUR LESSONS AND YOU SHALL HAVE IT SAID I
'WHO'S YOUR MASTER
'DEVIL DADDY WAS HIS ANSWER
'AND WHAT DO YOU LEARN FROM DADDY I CONTINUED
HE JUMPED AT THE FRUIT I RAISED IT HIGHER
'WHAT DOES HE TEACH YOU I
ASKED
'NAUGHT SAID HE 'BUT TO KEEP OUT OF HIS GAIT
DADDY CANNOT BIDE ME
BECAUSE I SWEAR AT HIM
'AH AND THE DEVIL TEACHES YOU TO SWEAR AT DADDY I OBSERVED
'AY NAY HE DRAWLED
'WHO THEN
'HEATHCLIFF
'I ASKED IF HE LIKED MR
HEATHCLIFF
'AY HE ANSWERED AGAIN
DESIRING TO HAVE HIS REASONS FOR LIKING HIM I COULD ONLY GATHER THE
SENTENCES 'I KNOWN'T HE PAYS DAD BACK WHAT HE GIES TO ME HE CURSES
DADDY FOR CURSING ME
HE SAYS I MUN DO AS I WILL
'AND THE CURATE DOES NOT TEACH YOU TO READ AND WRITE THEN I PURSUED
'NO I WAS TOLD THE CURATE SHOULD HAVE HIS TEETH DASHED DOWN HIS THROAT
IF HE STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD HEATHCLIFF HAD PROMISED THAT
I PUT THE ORANGE IN HIS HAND AND BADE HIM TELL HIS FATHER THAT A WOMAN
CALLED NELLY DEAN WAS WAITING TO SPEAK WITH HIM BY THE GARDEN GATE
HE
WENT UP THE WALK AND ENTERED THE HOUSE BUT INSTEAD OF HINDLEY
HEATHCLIFF APPEARED ON THE DOOR STONES AND I TURNED DIRECTLY AND RAN
DOWN THE ROAD AS HARD AS EVER I COULD RACE MAKING NO HALT TILL I GAINED
THE GUIDE POST AND FEELING AS SCARED AS IF I HAD RAISED A GOBLIN
THIS
IS NOT MUCH CONNECTED WITH MISS ISABELLA'S AFFAIR EXCEPT THAT IT URGED
ME TO RESOLVE FURTHER ON MOUNTING VIGILANT GUARD AND DOING MY UTMOST TO
CHECK THE SPREAD OF SUCH BAD INFLUENCE AT THE GRANGE EVEN THOUGH I
SHOULD WAKE A DOMESTIC STORM BY THWARTING MRS
LINTON'S PLEASURE
THE NEXT TIME HEATHCLIFF CAME MY YOUNG LADY CHANCED TO BE FEEDING SOME
PIGEONS IN THE COURT
SHE HAD NEVER SPOKEN A WORD TO HER SISTER IN LAW
FOR THREE DAYS BUT SHE HAD LIKEWISE DROPPED HER FRETFUL COMPLAINING AND
WE FOUND IT A GREAT COMFORT
HEATHCLIFF HAD NOT THE HABIT OF BESTOWING A
SINGLE UNNECESSARY CIVILITY ON MISS LINTON I KNEW
NOW AS SOON AS HE
BEHELD HER HIS FIRST PRECAUTION WAS TO TAKE A SWEEPING SURVEY OF THE
HOUSE FRONT
I WAS STANDING BY THE KITCHEN WINDOW BUT I DREW OUT OF
SIGHT
HE THEN STEPPED ACROSS THE PAVEMENT TO HER AND SAID SOMETHING
SHE SEEMED EMBARRASSED AND DESIROUS OF GETTING AWAY TO PREVENT IT HE
LAID HIS HAND ON HER ARM
SHE AVERTED HER FACE HE APPARENTLY PUT SOME
QUESTION WHICH SHE HAD NO MIND TO ANSWER
THERE WAS ANOTHER RAPID GLANCE
AT THE HOUSE AND SUPPOSING HIMSELF UNSEEN THE SCOUNDREL HAD THE
IMPUDENCE TO EMBRACE HER
'JUDAS TRAITOR I EJACULATED
'YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE TOO ARE YOU A
DELIBERATE DECEIVER
'WHO IS NELLY SAID CATHERINE'S VOICE AT MY ELBOW I HAD BEEN
OVER INTENT ON WATCHING THE PAIR OUTSIDE TO MARK HER ENTRANCE
'YOUR WORTHLESS FRIEND I ANSWERED WARMLY 'THE SNEAKING RASCAL YONDER
AH HE HAS CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF US HE IS COMING IN I WONDER WILL HE
HAVE THE HEART TO FIND A PLAUSIBLE EXCUSE FOR MAKING LOVE TO MISS WHEN
HE TOLD YOU HE HATED HER
MRS
LINTON SAW ISABELLA TEAR HERSELF FREE AND RUN INTO THE GARDEN AND
A MINUTE AFTER HEATHCLIFF OPENED THE DOOR
I COULDN'T WITHHOLD GIVING
SOME LOOSE TO MY INDIGNATION BUT CATHERINE ANGRILY INSISTED ON SILENCE
AND THREATENED TO ORDER ME OUT OF THE KITCHEN IF I DARED TO BE SO
PRESUMPTUOUS AS TO PUT IN MY INSOLENT TONGUE
'TO HEAR YOU PEOPLE MIGHT THINK YOU WERE THE MISTRESS SHE CRIED
'YOU
WANT SETTING DOWN IN YOUR RIGHT PLACE HEATHCLIFF WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT
RAISING THIS STIR I SAID YOU MUST LET ISABELLA ALONE I BEG YOU WILL
UNLESS YOU ARE TIRED OF BEING RECEIVED HERE AND WISH LINTON TO DRAW THE
BOLTS AGAINST YOU
'GOD FORBID THAT HE SHOULD TRY ANSWERED THE BLACK VILLAIN
I DETESTED
HIM JUST THEN
'GOD KEEP HIM MEEK AND PATIENT EVERY DAY I GROW MADDER
AFTER SENDING HIM TO HEAVEN
'HUSH SAID CATHERINE SHUTTING THE INNER DOOR 'DON'T VEX ME
WHY
HAVE YOU DISREGARDED MY REQUEST DID SHE COME ACROSS YOU ON PURPOSE
'WHAT IS IT TO YOU HE GROWLED
'I HAVE A RIGHT TO KISS HER IF SHE
CHOOSES AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO OBJECT
I AM NOT YOUR HUSBAND YOU
NEEDN'T BE JEALOUS OF ME
'I'M NOT JEALOUS OF YOU REPLIED THE MISTRESS 'I'M JEALOUS FOR YOU
CLEAR YOUR FACE YOU SHA'N'T SCOWL AT ME IF YOU LIKE ISABELLA YOU
SHALL MARRY HER
BUT DO YOU LIKE HER TELL THE TRUTH HEATHCLIFF
THERE YOU WON'T ANSWER
I'M CERTAIN YOU DON'T
'AND WOULD MR
LINTON APPROVE OF HIS SISTER MARRYING THAT MAN I
INQUIRED
'MR
LINTON SHOULD APPROVE RETURNED MY LADY DECISIVELY
'HE MIGHT SPARE HIMSELF THE TROUBLE SAID HEATHCLIFF 'I COULD DO AS
WELL WITHOUT HIS APPROBATION
AND AS TO YOU CATHERINE I HAVE A MIND TO
SPEAK A FEW WORDS NOW WHILE WE ARE AT IT
I WANT YOU TO BE AWARE THAT I
KNOW YOU HAVE TREATED ME INFERNALLY INFERNALLY DO YOU HEAR AND IF
YOU FLATTER YOURSELF THAT I DON'T PERCEIVE IT YOU ARE A FOOL AND IF
YOU THINK I CAN BE CONSOLED BY SWEET WORDS YOU ARE AN IDIOT AND IF YOU
FANCY I'LL SUFFER UNREVENGED I'LL CONVINCE YOU OF THE CONTRARY IN A
VERY LITTLE WHILE MEANTIME THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME YOUR
SISTER IN LAW'S SECRET I SWEAR I'LL MAKE THE MOST OF IT
AND STAND YOU
ASIDE
'WHAT NEW PHASE OF HIS CHARACTER IS THIS EXCLAIMED MRS
LINTON IN
AMAZEMENT
'I'VE TREATED YOU INFERNALLY AND YOU'LL TAKE YOUR REVENGE
HOW WILL YOU TAKE IT UNGRATEFUL BRUTE HOW HAVE I TREATED YOU
INFERNALLY
'I SEEK NO REVENGE ON YOU REPLIED HEATHCLIFF LESS VEHEMENTLY
'THAT'S
NOT THE PLAN
THE TYRANT GRINDS DOWN HIS SLAVES AND THEY DON'T TURN
AGAINST HIM THEY CRUSH THOSE BENEATH THEM
YOU ARE WELCOME TO TORTURE
ME TO DEATH FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT ONLY ALLOW ME TO AMUSE MYSELF A LITTLE IN
THE SAME STYLE AND REFRAIN FROM INSULT AS MUCH AS YOU ARE ABLE
HAVING
LEVELLED MY PALACE DON'T ERECT A HOVEL AND COMPLACENTLY ADMIRE YOUR OWN
CHARITY IN GIVING ME THAT FOR A HOME
IF I IMAGINED YOU REALLY WISHED ME
TO MARRY ISABEL I'D CUT MY THROAT
'OH THE EVIL IS THAT I AM NOT JEALOUS IS IT CRIED CATHERINE
'WELL
I WON'T REPEAT MY OFFER OF A WIFE IT IS AS BAD AS OFFERING SATAN A LOST
SOUL
YOUR BLISS LIES LIKE HIS IN INFLICTING MISERY
YOU PROVE IT
EDGAR IS RESTORED FROM THE ILL TEMPER HE GAVE WAY TO AT YOUR COMING I
BEGIN TO BE SECURE AND TRANQUIL AND YOU RESTLESS TO KNOW US AT PEACE
APPEAR RESOLVED ON EXCITING A QUARREL
QUARREL WITH EDGAR IF YOU
PLEASE HEATHCLIFF AND DECEIVE HIS SISTER YOU'LL HIT ON EXACTLY THE
MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF REVENGING YOURSELF ON ME
THE CONVERSATION CEASED
MRS
LINTON SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE FLUSHED AND
GLOOMY
THE SPIRIT WHICH SERVED HER WAS GROWING INTRACTABLE SHE COULD
NEITHER LAY NOR CONTROL IT
HE STOOD ON THE HEARTH WITH FOLDED ARMS
BROODING ON HIS EVIL THOUGHTS AND IN THIS POSITION I LEFT THEM TO SEEK
THE MASTER WHO WAS WONDERING WHAT KEPT CATHERINE BELOW SO LONG
'ELLEN SAID HE WHEN I ENTERED 'HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR MISTRESS
'YES SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN SIR I ANSWERED
'SHE'S SADLY PUT OUT BY
MR
HEATHCLIFF'S BEHAVIOUR AND INDEED I DO THINK IT'S TIME TO ARRANGE
HIS VISITS ON ANOTHER FOOTING
THERE'S HARM IN BEING TOO SOFT AND NOW
IT'S COME TO THIS AND I RELATED THE SCENE IN THE COURT AND AS NEAR
AS I DARED THE WHOLE SUBSEQUENT DISPUTE
I FANCIED IT COULD NOT BE VERY
PREJUDICIAL TO MRS
LINTON UNLESS SHE MADE IT SO AFTERWARDS BY ASSUMING
THE DEFENSIVE FOR HER GUEST
EDGAR LINTON HAD DIFFICULTY IN HEARING ME
TO THE CLOSE
HIS FIRST WORDS REVEALED THAT HE DID NOT CLEAR HIS WIFE OF
BLAME
'THIS IS INSUFFERABLE HE EXCLAIMED
'IT IS DISGRACEFUL THAT SHE SHOULD
OWN HIM FOR A FRIEND AND FORCE HIS COMPANY ON ME CALL ME TWO MEN OUT
OF THE HALL ELLEN
CATHERINE SHALL LINGER NO LONGER TO ARGUE WITH THE
LOW RUFFIAN I HAVE HUMOURED HER ENOUGH
HE DESCENDED AND BIDDING THE SERVANTS WAIT IN THE PASSAGE WENT
FOLLOWED BY ME TO THE KITCHEN
ITS OCCUPANTS HAD RECOMMENCED THEIR
ANGRY DISCUSSION MRS
LINTON AT LEAST WAS SCOLDING WITH RENEWED
VIGOUR HEATHCLIFF HAD MOVED TO THE WINDOW AND HUNG HIS HEAD SOMEWHAT
COWED BY HER VIOLENT RATING APPARENTLY
HE SAW THE MASTER FIRST AND
MADE A HASTY MOTION THAT SHE SHOULD BE SILENT WHICH SHE OBEYED
ABRUPTLY ON DISCOVERING THE REASON OF HIS INTIMATION
'HOW IS THIS SAID LINTON ADDRESSING HER 'WHAT NOTION OF PROPRIETY
MUST YOU HAVE TO REMAIN HERE AFTER THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN HELD TO
YOU BY THAT BLACKGUARD I SUPPOSE BECAUSE IT IS HIS ORDINARY TALK YOU
THINK NOTHING OF IT YOU ARE HABITUATED TO HIS BASENESS AND PERHAPS
IMAGINE I CAN GET USED TO IT TOO
'HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR EDGAR ASKED THE MISTRESS IN A
TONE PARTICULARLY CALCULATED TO PROVOKE HER HUSBAND IMPLYING BOTH
CARELESSNESS AND CONTEMPT OF HIS IRRITATION
HEATHCLIFF WHO HAD RAISED
HIS EYES AT THE FORMER SPEECH GAVE A SNEERING LAUGH AT THE LATTER ON
PURPOSE IT SEEMED TO DRAW MR
LINTON'S ATTENTION TO HIM
HE SUCCEEDED
BUT EDGAR DID NOT MEAN TO ENTERTAIN HIM WITH ANY HIGH FLIGHTS OF PASSION
'I'VE BEEN SO FAR FORBEARING WITH YOU SIR HE SAID QUIETLY 'NOT THAT I
WAS IGNORANT OF YOUR MISERABLE DEGRADED CHARACTER BUT I FELT YOU WERE
ONLY PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND CATHERINE WISHING TO KEEP UP YOUR
ACQUAINTANCE I ACQUIESCED FOOLISHLY
YOUR PRESENCE IS A MORAL POISON
THAT WOULD CONTAMINATE THE MOST VIRTUOUS FOR THAT CAUSE AND TO PREVENT
WORSE CONSEQUENCES I SHALL DENY YOU HEREAFTER ADMISSION INTO THIS HOUSE
AND GIVE NOTICE NOW THAT I REQUIRE YOUR INSTANT DEPARTURE
THREE
MINUTES' DELAY WILL RENDER IT INVOLUNTARY AND IGNOMINIOUS
HEATHCLIFF MEASURED THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH OF THE SPEAKER WITH AN EYE
FULL OF DERISION
'CATHY THIS LAMB OF YOURS THREATENS LIKE A BULL HE SAID
'IT IS IN
DANGER OF SPLITTING ITS SKULL AGAINST MY KNUCKLES
BY GOD MR
LINTON
I'M MORTALLY SORRY THAT YOU ARE NOT WORTH KNOCKING DOWN
MY MASTER GLANCED TOWARDS THE PASSAGE AND SIGNED ME TO FETCH THE MEN HE
HAD NO INTENTION OF HAZARDING A PERSONAL ENCOUNTER
I OBEYED THE HINT
BUT MRS
LINTON SUSPECTING SOMETHING FOLLOWED AND WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO
CALL THEM SHE PULLED ME BACK SLAMMED THE DOOR TO AND LOCKED IT
'FAIR MEANS SHE SAID IN ANSWER TO HER HUSBAND'S LOOK OF ANGRY
SURPRISE
'IF YOU HAVE NOT COURAGE TO ATTACK HIM MAKE AN APOLOGY OR
ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE BEATEN
IT WILL CORRECT YOU OF FEIGNING MORE VALOUR
THAN YOU POSSESS
NO I'LL SWALLOW THE KEY BEFORE YOU SHALL GET IT I'M
DELIGHTFULLY REWARDED FOR MY KINDNESS TO EACH AFTER CONSTANT INDULGENCE
OF ONE'S WEAK NATURE AND THE OTHER'S BAD ONE I EARN FOR THANKS TWO
SAMPLES OF BLIND INGRATITUDE STUPID TO ABSURDITY EDGAR I WAS
DEFENDING YOU AND YOURS AND I WISH HEATHCLIFF MAY FLOG YOU SICK FOR
DARING TO THINK AN EVIL THOUGHT OF ME
IT DID NOT NEED THE MEDIUM OF A FLOGGING TO PRODUCE THAT EFFECT ON THE
MASTER
HE TRIED TO WREST THE KEY FROM CATHERINE'S GRASP AND FOR SAFETY
SHE FLUNG IT INTO THE HOTTEST PART OF THE FIRE WHEREUPON MR
EDGAR WAS
TAKEN WITH A NERVOUS TREMBLING AND HIS COUNTENANCE GREW DEADLY PALE
FOR
HIS LIFE HE COULD NOT AVERT THAT EXCESS OF EMOTION MINGLED ANGUISH AND
HUMILIATION OVERCAME HIM COMPLETELY
HE LEANT ON THE BACK OF A CHAIR
AND COVERED HIS FACE
'OH HEAVENS IN OLD DAYS THIS WOULD WIN YOU KNIGHTHOOD EXCLAIMED MRS
LINTON
'WE ARE VANQUISHED WE ARE VANQUISHED HEATHCLIFF WOULD AS SOON
LIFT A FINGER AT YOU AS THE KING WOULD MARCH HIS ARMY AGAINST A COLONY OF
MICE
CHEER UP YOU SHA'N'T BE HURT YOUR TYPE IS NOT A LAMB IT'S A
SUCKING LEVERET
'I WISH YOU JOY OF THE MILK BLOODED COWARD CATHY SAID HER FRIEND
'I
COMPLIMENT YOU ON YOUR TASTE
AND THAT IS THE SLAVERING SHIVERING THING
YOU PREFERRED TO ME I WOULD NOT STRIKE HIM WITH MY FIST BUT I'D KICK
HIM WITH MY FOOT AND EXPERIENCE CONSIDERABLE SATISFACTION
IS HE
WEEPING OR IS HE GOING TO FAINT FOR FEAR
THE FELLOW APPROACHED AND GAVE THE CHAIR ON WHICH LINTON RESTED A PUSH
HE'D BETTER HAVE KEPT HIS DISTANCE MY MASTER QUICKLY SPRANG ERECT AND
STRUCK HIM FULL ON THE THROAT A BLOW THAT WOULD HAVE LEVELLED A SLIGHTER
MAN
IT TOOK HIS BREATH FOR A MINUTE AND WHILE HE CHOKED MR
LINTON
WALKED OUT BY THE BACK DOOR INTO THE YARD AND FROM THENCE TO THE FRONT
ENTRANCE
'THERE YOU'VE DONE WITH COMING HERE CRIED CATHERINE
'GET AWAY NOW
HE'LL RETURN WITH A BRACE OF PISTOLS AND HALF A DOZEN ASSISTANTS
IF HE
DID OVERHEAR US OF COURSE HE'D NEVER FORGIVE YOU
YOU'VE PLAYED ME AN
ILL TURN HEATHCLIFF BUT GO MAKE HASTE I'D RATHER SEE EDGAR AT BAY
THAN YOU
'DO YOU SUPPOSE I'M GOING WITH THAT BLOW BURNING IN MY GULLET HE
THUNDERED
'BY HELL NO I'LL CRUSH HIS RIBS IN LIKE A ROTTEN HAZEL NUT
BEFORE I CROSS THE THRESHOLD IF I DON'T FLOOR HIM NOW I SHALL MURDER
HIM SOME TIME SO AS YOU VALUE HIS EXISTENCE LET ME GET AT HIM
'HE IS NOT COMING I INTERPOSED FRAMING A BIT OF A LIE
'THERE'S THE
COACHMAN AND THE TWO GARDENERS YOU'LL SURELY NOT WAIT TO BE THRUST INTO
THE ROAD BY THEM EACH HAS A BLUDGEON AND MASTER WILL VERY LIKELY BE
WATCHING FROM THE PARLOUR WINDOWS TO SEE THAT THEY FULFIL HIS ORDERS
THE GARDENERS AND COACHMAN WERE THERE BUT LINTON WAS WITH THEM
THEY
HAD ALREADY ENTERED THE COURT
HEATHCLIFF ON THE SECOND THOUGHTS
RESOLVED TO AVOID A STRUGGLE AGAINST THREE UNDERLINGS HE SEIZED THE
POKER SMASHED THE LOCK FROM THE INNER DOOR AND MADE HIS ESCAPE AS THEY
TRAMPED IN
MRS
LINTON WHO WAS VERY MUCH EXCITED BADE ME ACCOMPANY HER UP STAIRS
SHE DID NOT KNOW MY SHARE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE DISTURBANCE AND I WAS
ANXIOUS TO KEEP HER IN IGNORANCE
'I'M NEARLY DISTRACTED NELLY SHE EXCLAIMED THROWING HERSELF ON THE
SOFA
'A THOUSAND SMITHS' HAMMERS ARE BEATING IN MY HEAD TELL ISABELLA
TO SHUN ME THIS UPROAR IS OWING TO HER AND SHOULD SHE OR ANY ONE ELSE
AGGRAVATE MY ANGER AT PRESENT I SHALL GET WILD
AND NELLY SAY TO
EDGAR IF YOU SEE HIM AGAIN TO NIGHT THAT I'M IN DANGER OF BEING
SERIOUSLY ILL
I WISH IT MAY PROVE TRUE
HE HAS STARTLED AND DISTRESSED
ME SHOCKINGLY I WANT TO FRIGHTEN HIM
BESIDES HE MIGHT COME AND BEGIN
A STRING OF ABUSE OR COMPLAININGS I'M CERTAIN I SHOULD RECRIMINATE AND
GOD KNOWS WHERE WE SHOULD END WILL YOU DO SO MY GOOD NELLY YOU ARE
AWARE THAT I AM NO WAY BLAMABLE IN THIS MATTER
WHAT POSSESSED HIM TO
TURN LISTENER HEATHCLIFF'S TALK WAS OUTRAGEOUS AFTER YOU LEFT US BUT
I COULD SOON HAVE DIVERTED HIM FROM ISABELLA AND THE REST MEANT NOTHING
NOW ALL IS DASHED WRONG BY THE FOOL'S CRAVING TO HEAR EVIL OF SELF THAT
HAUNTS SOME PEOPLE LIKE A DEMON HAD EDGAR NEVER GATHERED OUR
CONVERSATION HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THE WORSE FOR IT
REALLY WHEN HE
OPENED ON ME IN THAT UNREASONABLE TONE OF DISPLEASURE AFTER I HAD SCOLDED
HEATHCLIFF TILL I WAS HOARSE FOR HIM I DID NOT CARE HARDLY WHAT THEY DID
TO EACH OTHER ESPECIALLY AS I FELT THAT HOWEVER THE SCENE CLOSED WE
SHOULD ALL BE DRIVEN ASUNDER FOR NOBODY KNOWS HOW LONG WELL IF I
CANNOT KEEP HEATHCLIFF FOR MY FRIEND IF EDGAR WILL BE MEAN AND JEALOUS
I'LL TRY TO BREAK THEIR HEARTS BY BREAKING MY OWN
THAT WILL BE A PROMPT
WAY OF FINISHING ALL WHEN I AM PUSHED TO EXTREMITY BUT IT'S A DEED TO
BE RESERVED FOR A FORLORN HOPE I'D NOT TAKE LINTON BY SURPRISE WITH IT
TO THIS POINT HE HAS BEEN DISCREET IN DREADING TO PROVOKE ME YOU MUST
REPRESENT THE PERIL OF QUITTING THAT POLICY AND REMIND HIM OF MY
PASSIONATE TEMPER VERGING WHEN KINDLED ON FRENZY
I WISH YOU COULD
DISMISS THAT APATHY OUT OF THAT COUNTENANCE AND LOOK RATHER MORE ANXIOUS
ABOUT ME
THE STOLIDITY WITH WHICH I RECEIVED THESE INSTRUCTIONS WAS NO DOUBT
RATHER EXASPERATING FOR THEY WERE DELIVERED IN PERFECT SINCERITY BUT I
BELIEVED A PERSON WHO COULD PLAN THE TURNING OF HER FITS OF PASSION TO
ACCOUNT BEFOREHAND MIGHT BY EXERTING HER WILL MANAGE TO CONTROL
HERSELF TOLERABLY EVEN WHILE UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE AND I DID NOT WISH
TO 'FRIGHTEN' HER HUSBAND AS SHE SAID AND MULTIPLY HIS ANNOYANCES FOR
THE PURPOSE OF SERVING HER SELFISHNESS
THEREFORE I SAID NOTHING WHEN I
MET THE MASTER COMING TOWARDS THE PARLOUR BUT I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF
TURNING BACK TO LISTEN WHETHER THEY WOULD RESUME THEIR QUARREL TOGETHER
HE BEGAN TO SPEAK FIRST
'REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE CATHERINE HE SAID WITHOUT ANY ANGER IN HIS
VOICE BUT WITH MUCH SORROWFUL DESPONDENCY
'I SHALL NOT STAY
I AM
NEITHER COME TO WRANGLE NOR BE RECONCILED BUT I WISH JUST TO LEARN
WHETHER AFTER THIS EVENING'S EVENTS YOU INTEND TO CONTINUE YOUR
INTIMACY WITH
'OH FOR MERCY'S SAKE INTERRUPTED THE MISTRESS STAMPING HER FOOT 'FOR
MERCY'S SAKE LET US HEAR NO MORE OF IT NOW YOUR COLD BLOOD CANNOT BE
WORKED INTO A FEVER YOUR VEINS ARE FULL OF ICE WATER BUT MINE ARE
BOILING AND THE SIGHT OF SUCH CHILLNESS MAKES THEM DANCE
'TO GET RID OF ME ANSWER MY QUESTION PERSEVERED MR
LINTON
'YOU MUST
ANSWER IT AND THAT VIOLENCE DOES NOT ALARM ME
I HAVE FOUND THAT YOU
CAN BE AS STOICAL AS ANYONE WHEN YOU PLEASE
WILL YOU GIVE UP
HEATHCLIFF HEREAFTER OR WILL YOU GIVE UP ME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO BE MY FRIEND AND HIS AT THE SAME TIME AND I ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE
TO KNOW WHICH YOU CHOOSE
'I REQUIRE TO BE LET ALONE EXCLAIMED CATHERINE FURIOUSLY
'I DEMAND
IT DON'T YOU SEE I CAN SCARCELY STAND EDGAR YOU YOU LEAVE ME
SHE RANG THE BELL TILL IT BROKE WITH A TWANG I ENTERED LEISURELY
IT
WAS ENOUGH TO TRY THE TEMPER OF A SAINT SUCH SENSELESS WICKED RAGES
THERE SHE LAY DASHING HER HEAD AGAINST THE ARM OF THE SOFA AND GRINDING
HER TEETH SO THAT YOU MIGHT FANCY SHE WOULD CRASH THEM TO SPLINTERS MR
LINTON STOOD LOOKING AT HER IN SUDDEN COMPUNCTION AND FEAR
HE TOLD ME
TO FETCH SOME WATER
SHE HAD NO BREATH FOR SPEAKING
I BROUGHT A GLASS
FULL AND AS SHE WOULD NOT DRINK I SPRINKLED IT ON HER FACE
IN A FEW
SECONDS SHE STRETCHED HERSELF OUT STIFF AND TURNED UP HER EYES WHILE
HER CHEEKS AT ONCE BLANCHED AND LIVID ASSUMED THE ASPECT OF DEATH
LINTON LOOKED TERRIFIED
'THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD THE MATTER I WHISPERED
I DID NOT WANT
HIM TO YIELD THOUGH I COULD NOT HELP BEING AFRAID IN MY HEART
'SHE HAS BLOOD ON HER LIPS HE SAID SHUDDERING
'NEVER MIND I ANSWERED TARTLY
AND I TOLD HIM HOW SHE HAD RESOLVED
PREVIOUS TO HIS COMING ON EXHIBITING A FIT OF FRENZY
I INCAUTIOUSLY
GAVE THE ACCOUNT ALOUD AND SHE HEARD ME FOR SHE STARTED UP HER HAIR
FLYING OVER HER SHOULDERS HER EYES FLASHING THE MUSCLES OF HER NECK
AND ARMS STANDING OUT PRETERNATURALLY
I MADE UP MY MIND FOR BROKEN
BONES AT LEAST BUT SHE ONLY GLARED ABOUT HER FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN
RUSHED FROM THE ROOM
THE MASTER DIRECTED ME TO FOLLOW I DID TO HER
CHAMBER DOOR SHE HINDERED ME FROM GOING FURTHER BY SECURING IT AGAINST
ME
AS SHE NEVER OFFERED TO DESCEND TO BREAKFAST NEXT MORNING I WENT TO ASK
WHETHER SHE WOULD HAVE SOME CARRIED UP
'NO SHE REPLIED PEREMPTORILY
THE SAME QUESTION WAS REPEATED AT DINNER AND TEA AND AGAIN ON THE MORROW
AFTER AND RECEIVED THE SAME ANSWER
MR
LINTON ON HIS PART SPENT HIS
TIME IN THE LIBRARY AND DID NOT INQUIRE CONCERNING HIS WIFE'S
OCCUPATIONS
ISABELLA AND HE HAD HAD AN HOUR'S INTERVIEW DURING WHICH
HE TRIED TO ELICIT FROM HER SOME SENTIMENT OF PROPER HORROR FOR
HEATHCLIFF'S ADVANCES BUT HE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF HER EVASIVE REPLIES
AND WAS OBLIGED TO CLOSE THE EXAMINATION UNSATISFACTORILY ADDING
HOWEVER A SOLEMN WARNING THAT IF SHE WERE SO INSANE AS TO ENCOURAGE
THAT WORTHLESS SUITOR IT WOULD DISSOLVE ALL BONDS OF RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN HERSELF AND HIM
CHAPTER XII
WHILE MISS LINTON MOPED ABOUT THE PARK AND GARDEN ALWAYS SILENT AND
ALMOST ALWAYS IN TEARS AND HER BROTHER SHUT HIMSELF UP AMONG BOOKS THAT
HE NEVER OPENED WEARYING I GUESSED WITH A CONTINUAL VAGUE EXPECTATION
THAT CATHERINE REPENTING HER CONDUCT WOULD COME OF HER OWN ACCORD TO
ASK PARDON AND SEEK A RECONCILIATION AND SHE FASTED PERTINACIOUSLY
UNDER THE IDEA PROBABLY THAT AT EVERY MEAL EDGAR WAS READY TO CHOKE FOR
HER ABSENCE AND PRIDE ALONE HELD HIM FROM RUNNING TO CAST HIMSELF AT HER
FEET I WENT ABOUT MY HOUSEHOLD DUTIES CONVINCED THAT THE GRANGE HAD BUT
ONE SENSIBLE SOUL IN ITS WALLS AND THAT LODGED IN MY BODY
I WASTED NO
CONDOLENCES ON MISS NOR ANY EXPOSTULATIONS ON MY MISTRESS NOR DID I PAY
MUCH ATTENTION TO THE SIGHS OF MY MASTER WHO YEARNED TO HEAR HIS LADY'S
NAME SINCE HE MIGHT NOT HEAR HER VOICE
I DETERMINED THEY SHOULD COME
ABOUT AS THEY PLEASED FOR ME AND THOUGH IT WAS A TIRESOMELY SLOW
PROCESS I BEGAN TO REJOICE AT LENGTH IN A FAINT DAWN OF ITS PROGRESS AS
I THOUGHT AT FIRST
MRS
LINTON ON THE THIRD DAY UNBARRED HER DOOR AND HAVING FINISHED THE
WATER IN HER PITCHER AND DECANTER DESIRED A RENEWED SUPPLY AND A BASIN
OF GRUEL FOR SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS DYING
THAT I SET DOWN AS A SPEECH
MEANT FOR EDGAR'S EARS I BELIEVED NO SUCH THING SO I KEPT IT TO MYSELF
AND BROUGHT HER SOME TEA AND DRY TOAST
SHE ATE AND DRANK EAGERLY AND
SANK BACK ON HER PILLOW AGAIN CLENCHING HER HANDS AND GROANING
'OH I
WILL DIE SHE EXCLAIMED 'SINCE NO ONE CARES ANYTHING ABOUT ME
I WISH
I HAD NOT TAKEN THAT THEN A GOOD WHILE AFTER I HEARD HER MURMUR 'NO
I'LL NOT DIE HE'D BE GLAD HE DOES NOT LOVE ME AT ALL HE WOULD NEVER
MISS ME
'DID YOU WANT ANYTHING MA'AM I INQUIRED STILL PRESERVING MY EXTERNAL
COMPOSURE IN SPITE OF HER GHASTLY COUNTENANCE AND STRANGE EXAGGERATED
MANNER
'WHAT IS THAT APATHETIC BEING DOING SHE DEMANDED PUSHING THE THICK
ENTANGLED LOCKS FROM HER WASTED FACE
'HAS HE FALLEN INTO A LETHARGY OR
IS HE DEAD
'NEITHER REPLIED I 'IF YOU MEAN MR
LINTON
HE'S TOLERABLY WELL I
THINK THOUGH HIS STUDIES OCCUPY HIM RATHER MORE THAN THEY OUGHT HE IS
CONTINUALLY AMONG HIS BOOKS SINCE HE HAS NO OTHER SOCIETY
I SHOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN SO IF I HAD KNOWN HER TRUE CONDITION BUT I
COULD NOT GET RID OF THE NOTION THAT SHE ACTED A PART OF HER DISORDER
'AMONG HIS BOOKS SHE CRIED CONFOUNDED
'AND I DYING I ON THE BRINK
OF THE GRAVE MY GOD DOES HE KNOW HOW I'M ALTERED CONTINUED SHE
STARING AT HER REFLECTION IN A MIRROR HANGING AGAINST THE OPPOSITE WALL
'IS THAT CATHERINE LINTON HE IMAGINES ME IN A PET IN PLAY PERHAPS
CANNOT YOU INFORM HIM THAT IT IS FRIGHTFUL EARNEST NELLY IF IT BE NOT
TOO LATE AS SOON AS I LEARN HOW HE FEELS I'LL CHOOSE BETWEEN THESE TWO
EITHER TO STARVE AT ONCE THAT WOULD BE NO PUNISHMENT UNLESS HE HAD A
HEART OR TO RECOVER AND LEAVE THE COUNTRY
ARE YOU SPEAKING THE TRUTH
ABOUT HIM NOW TAKE CARE
IS HE ACTUALLY SO UTTERLY INDIFFERENT FOR MY
LIFE
'WHY MA'AM I ANSWERED 'THE MASTER HAS NO IDEA OF YOUR BEING DERANGED
AND OF COURSE HE DOES NOT FEAR THAT YOU WILL LET YOURSELF DIE OF HUNGER
'YOU THINK NOT CANNOT YOU TELL HIM I WILL SHE RETURNED
'PERSUADE
HIM SPEAK OF YOUR OWN MIND SAY YOU ARE CERTAIN I WILL
'NO YOU FORGET MRS
LINTON I SUGGESTED 'THAT YOU HAVE EATEN SOME
FOOD WITH A RELISH THIS EVENING AND TO MORROW YOU WILL PERCEIVE ITS GOOD
EFFECTS
'IF I WERE ONLY SURE IT WOULD KILL HIM SHE INTERRUPTED 'I'D KILL
MYSELF DIRECTLY THESE THREE AWFUL NIGHTS I'VE NEVER CLOSED MY LIDS AND
OH I'VE BEEN TORMENTED I'VE BEEN HAUNTED NELLY BUT I BEGIN TO FANCY
YOU DON'T LIKE ME
HOW STRANGE I THOUGHT THOUGH EVERYBODY HATED AND
DESPISED EACH OTHER THEY COULD NOT AVOID LOVING ME
AND THEY HAVE ALL
TURNED TO ENEMIES IN A FEW HOURS THEY HAVE I'M POSITIVE THE PEOPLE
HERE
HOW DREARY TO MEET DEATH SURROUNDED BY THEIR COLD FACES
ISABELLA TERRIFIED AND REPELLED AFRAID TO ENTER THE ROOM IT WOULD BE
SO DREADFUL TO WATCH CATHERINE GO
AND EDGAR STANDING SOLEMNLY BY TO SEE
IT OVER THEN OFFERING PRAYERS OF THANKS TO GOD FOR RESTORING PEACE TO
HIS HOUSE AND GOING BACK TO HIS BOOKS WHAT IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT
FEELS HAS HE TO DO WITH BOOKS WHEN I AM DYING
SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE NOTION WHICH I HAD PUT INTO HER HEAD OF MR
LINTON'S PHILOSOPHICAL RESIGNATION
TOSSING ABOUT SHE INCREASED HER
FEVERISH BEWILDERMENT TO MADNESS AND TORE THE PILLOW WITH HER TEETH
THEN RAISING HERSELF UP ALL BURNING DESIRED THAT I WOULD OPEN THE
WINDOW
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER THE WIND BLEW STRONG FROM THE
NORTH EAST AND I OBJECTED
BOTH THE EXPRESSIONS FLITTING OVER HER FACE
AND THE CHANGES OF HER MOODS BEGAN TO ALARM ME TERRIBLY AND BROUGHT TO
MY RECOLLECTION HER FORMER ILLNESS AND THE DOCTOR'S INJUNCTION THAT SHE
SHOULD NOT BE CROSSED
A MINUTE PREVIOUSLY SHE WAS VIOLENT NOW
SUPPORTED ON ONE ARM AND NOT NOTICING MY REFUSAL TO OBEY HER SHE SEEMED
TO FIND CHILDISH DIVERSION IN PULLING THE FEATHERS FROM THE RENTS SHE HAD
JUST MADE AND RANGING THEM ON THE SHEET ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT
SPECIES HER MIND HAD STRAYED TO OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
'THAT'S A TURKEY'S SHE MURMURED TO HERSELF 'AND THIS IS A WILD DUCK'S
AND THIS IS A PIGEON'S
AH THEY PUT PIGEONS' FEATHERS IN THE PILLOWS NO
WONDER I COULDN'T DIE LET ME TAKE CARE TO THROW IT ON THE FLOOR WHEN I
LIE DOWN
AND HERE IS A MOOR COCK'S AND THIS I SHOULD KNOW IT AMONG A
THOUSAND IT'S A LAPWING'S
BONNY BIRD WHEELING OVER OUR HEADS IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE MOOR
IT WANTED TO GET TO ITS NEST FOR THE CLOUDS HAD
TOUCHED THE SWELLS AND IT FELT RAIN COMING
THIS FEATHER WAS PICKED UP
FROM THE HEATH THE BIRD WAS NOT SHOT WE SAW ITS NEST IN THE WINTER
FULL OF LITTLE SKELETONS
HEATHCLIFF SET A TRAP OVER IT AND THE OLD
ONES DARED NOT COME
I MADE HIM PROMISE HE'D NEVER SHOOT A LAPWING AFTER
THAT AND HE DIDN'T
YES HERE ARE MORE DID HE SHOOT MY LAPWINGS
NELLY ARE THEY RED ANY OF THEM LET ME LOOK
'GIVE OVER WITH THAT BABY WORK I INTERRUPTED DRAGGING THE PILLOW AWAY
AND TURNING THE HOLES TOWARDS THE MATTRESS FOR SHE WAS REMOVING ITS
CONTENTS BY HANDFULS
'LIE DOWN AND SHUT YOUR EYES YOU'RE WANDERING
THERE'S A MESS THE DOWN IS FLYING ABOUT LIKE SNOW
I WENT HERE AND THERE COLLECTING IT
'I SEE IN YOU NELLY SHE CONTINUED DREAMILY 'AN AGED WOMAN YOU HAVE
GREY HAIR AND BENT SHOULDERS
THIS BED IS THE FAIRY CAVE UNDER PENISTONE
CRAGS AND YOU ARE GATHERING ELF BOLTS TO HURT OUR HEIFERS PRETENDING
WHILE I AM NEAR THAT THEY ARE ONLY LOCKS OF WOOL
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL
COME TO FIFTY YEARS HENCE I KNOW YOU ARE NOT SO NOW
I'M NOT WANDERING
YOU'RE MISTAKEN OR ELSE I SHOULD BELIEVE YOU REALLY WERE THAT WITHERED
HAG AND I SHOULD THINK I WAS UNDER PENISTONE CRAGS AND I'M CONSCIOUS
IT'S NIGHT AND THERE ARE TWO CANDLES ON THE TABLE MAKING THE BLACK PRESS
SHINE LIKE JET
'THE BLACK PRESS WHERE IS THAT I ASKED
'YOU ARE TALKING IN YOUR
SLEEP
'IT'S AGAINST THE WALL AS IT ALWAYS IS SHE REPLIED
'IT DOES APPEAR
ODD I SEE A FACE IN IT
'THERE'S NO PRESS IN THE ROOM AND NEVER WAS SAID I RESUMING MY SEAT
AND LOOPING UP THE CURTAIN THAT I MIGHT WATCH HER
'DON'T YOU SEE THAT FACE SHE INQUIRED GAZING EARNESTLY AT THE
MIRROR
AND SAY WHAT I COULD I WAS INCAPABLE OF MAKING HER COMPREHEND IT TO BE
HER OWN SO I ROSE AND COVERED IT WITH A SHAWL
'IT'S BEHIND THERE STILL SHE PURSUED ANXIOUSLY
'AND IT STIRRED
WHO
IS IT I HOPE IT WILL NOT COME OUT WHEN YOU ARE GONE OH NELLY THE
ROOM IS HAUNTED I'M AFRAID OF BEING ALONE
I TOOK HER HAND IN MINE AND BID HER BE COMPOSED FOR A SUCCESSION OF
SHUDDERS CONVULSED HER FRAME AND SHE WOULD KEEP STRAINING HER GAZE
TOWARDS THE GLASS
'THERE'S NOBODY HERE I INSISTED
'IT WAS YOURSELF MRS
LINTON YOU
KNEW IT A WHILE SINCE
'MYSELF SHE GASPED 'AND THE CLOCK IS STRIKING TWELVE IT'S TRUE
THEN THAT'S DREADFUL
HER FINGERS CLUTCHED THE CLOTHES AND GATHERED THEM OVER HER EYES
I
ATTEMPTED TO STEAL TO THE DOOR WITH AN INTENTION OF CALLING HER HUSBAND
BUT I WAS SUMMONED BACK BY A PIERCING SHRIEK THE SHAWL HAD DROPPED FROM
THE FRAME
'WHY WHAT IS THE MATTER CRIED I
'WHO IS COWARD NOW WAKE UP THAT
IS THE GLASS THE MIRROR MRS
LINTON AND YOU SEE YOURSELF IN IT AND
THERE AM I TOO BY YOUR SIDE
TREMBLING AND BEWILDERED SHE HELD ME FAST BUT THE HORROR GRADUALLY
PASSED FROM HER COUNTENANCE ITS PALENESS GAVE PLACE TO A GLOW OF SHAME
'OH DEAR I THOUGHT I WAS AT HOME SHE SIGHED
'I THOUGHT I WAS LYING
IN MY CHAMBER AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS
BECAUSE I'M WEAK MY BRAIN GOT
CONFUSED AND I SCREAMED UNCONSCIOUSLY
DON'T SAY ANYTHING BUT STAY
WITH ME
I DREAD SLEEPING MY DREAMS APPAL ME
'A SOUND SLEEP WOULD DO YOU GOOD MA'AM I ANSWERED 'AND I HOPE THIS
SUFFERING WILL PREVENT YOUR TRYING STARVING AGAIN
'OH IF I WERE BUT IN MY OWN BED IN THE OLD HOUSE SHE WENT ON BITTERLY
WRINGING HER HANDS
'AND THAT WIND SOUNDING IN THE FIRS BY THE LATTICE
DO LET ME FEEL IT IT COMES STRAIGHT DOWN THE MOOR DO LET ME HAVE ONE
BREATH TO PACIFY HER I HELD THE CASEMENT AJAR A FEW SECONDS
A COLD
BLAST RUSHED THROUGH I CLOSED IT AND RETURNED TO MY POST
SHE LAY
STILL NOW HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS
EXHAUSTION OF BODY HAD ENTIRELY
SUBDUED HER SPIRIT OUR FIERY CATHERINE WAS NO BETTER THAN A WAILING
CHILD
'HOW LONG IS IT SINCE I SHUT MYSELF IN HERE SHE ASKED SUDDENLY
REVIVING
'IT WAS MONDAY EVENING I REPLIED 'AND THIS IS THURSDAY NIGHT OR
RATHER FRIDAY MORNING AT PRESENT
'WHAT OF THE SAME WEEK SHE EXCLAIMED
'ONLY THAT BRIEF TIME
'LONG ENOUGH TO LIVE ON NOTHING BUT COLD WATER AND ILL TEMPER OBSERVED
I
'WELL IT SEEMS A WEARY NUMBER OF HOURS SHE MUTTERED DOUBTFULLY 'IT
MUST BE MORE
I REMEMBER BEING IN THE PARLOUR AFTER THEY HAD QUARRELLED
AND EDGAR BEING CRUELLY PROVOKING AND ME RUNNING INTO THIS ROOM
DESPERATE
AS SOON AS EVER I HAD BARRED THE DOOR UTTER BLACKNESS
OVERWHELMED ME AND I FELL ON THE FLOOR
I COULDN'T EXPLAIN TO EDGAR HOW
CERTAIN I FELT OF HAVING A FIT OR GOING RAGING MAD IF HE PERSISTED IN
TEASING ME I HAD NO COMMAND OF TONGUE OR BRAIN AND HE DID NOT GUESS
MY AGONY PERHAPS IT BARELY LEFT ME SENSE TO TRY TO ESCAPE FROM HIM AND
HIS VOICE
BEFORE I RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO SEE AND HEAR IT BEGAN TO
BE DAWN AND NELLY I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THOUGHT AND WHAT HAS KEPT
RECURRING AND RECURRING TILL I FEARED FOR MY REASON
I THOUGHT AS I LAY
THERE WITH MY HEAD AGAINST THAT TABLE LEG AND MY EYES DIMLY DISCERNING
THE GREY SQUARE OF THE WINDOW THAT I WAS ENCLOSED IN THE OAK PANELLED
BED AT HOME AND MY HEART ACHED WITH SOME GREAT GRIEF WHICH JUST
WAKING I COULD NOT RECOLLECT
I PONDERED AND WORRIED MYSELF TO
DISCOVER WHAT IT COULD BE AND MOST STRANGELY THE WHOLE LAST SEVEN
YEARS OF MY LIFE GREW A BLANK I DID NOT RECALL THAT THEY HAD BEEN AT
ALL
I WAS A CHILD MY FATHER WAS JUST BURIED AND MY MISERY AROSE FROM
THE SEPARATION THAT HINDLEY HAD ORDERED BETWEEN ME AND HEATHCLIFF
I WAS
LAID ALONE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND ROUSING FROM A DISMAL DOZE AFTER A
NIGHT OF WEEPING I LIFTED MY HAND TO PUSH THE PANELS ASIDE IT STRUCK
THE TABLE TOP I SWEPT IT ALONG THE CARPET AND THEN MEMORY BURST IN MY
LATE ANGUISH WAS SWALLOWED IN A PAROXYSM OF DESPAIR
I CANNOT SAY WHY I
FELT SO WILDLY WRETCHED IT MUST HAVE BEEN TEMPORARY DERANGEMENT FOR
THERE IS SCARCELY CAUSE
BUT SUPPOSING AT TWELVE YEARS OLD I HAD BEEN
WRENCHED FROM THE HEIGHTS AND EVERY EARLY ASSOCIATION AND MY ALL IN
ALL AS HEATHCLIFF WAS AT THAT TIME AND BEEN CONVERTED AT A STROKE INTO
MRS
LINTON THE LADY OF THRUSHCROSS GRANGE AND THE WIFE OF A STRANGER
AN EXILE AND OUTCAST THENCEFORTH FROM WHAT HAD BEEN MY WORLD
YOU MAY
FANCY A GLIMPSE OF THE ABYSS WHERE I GROVELLED SHAKE YOUR HEAD AS YOU
WILL NELLY YOU HAVE HELPED TO UNSETTLE ME YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO
EDGAR INDEED YOU SHOULD AND COMPELLED HIM TO LEAVE ME QUIET OH I'M
BURNING I WISH I WERE OUT OF DOORS I WISH I WERE A GIRL AGAIN HALF
SAVAGE AND HARDY AND FREE AND LAUGHING AT INJURIES NOT MADDENING
UNDER THEM WHY AM I SO CHANGED WHY DOES MY BLOOD RUSH INTO A HELL OF
TUMULT AT A FEW WORDS I'M SURE I SHOULD BE MYSELF WERE I ONCE AMONG THE
HEATHER ON THOSE HILLS
OPEN THE WINDOW AGAIN WIDE FASTEN IT OPEN
QUICK WHY DON'T YOU MOVE
'BECAUSE I WON'T GIVE YOU YOUR DEATH OF COLD I ANSWERED
'YOU WON'T GIVE ME A CHANCE OF LIFE YOU MEAN SHE SAID SULLENLY
'HOWEVER I'M NOT HELPLESS YET I'LL OPEN IT MYSELF
AND SLIDING FROM THE BED BEFORE I COULD HINDER HER SHE CROSSED THE ROOM
WALKING VERY UNCERTAINLY THREW IT BACK AND BENT OUT CARELESS OF THE
FROSTY AIR THAT CUT ABOUT HER SHOULDERS AS KEEN AS A KNIFE
I ENTREATED
AND FINALLY ATTEMPTED TO FORCE HER TO RETIRE
BUT I SOON FOUND HER
DELIRIOUS STRENGTH MUCH SURPASSED MINE SHE WAS DELIRIOUS I BECAME
CONVINCED BY HER SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS AND RAVINGS
THERE WAS NO MOON AND
EVERYTHING BENEATH LAY IN MISTY DARKNESS NOT A LIGHT GLEAMED FROM ANY
HOUSE FAR OR NEAR ALL HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED LONG AGO AND THOSE AT
WUTHERING HEIGHTS WERE NEVER VISIBLE STILL SHE ASSERTED SHE CAUGHT THEIR
SHINING
'LOOK SHE CRIED EAGERLY 'THAT'S MY ROOM WITH THE CANDLE IN IT AND THE
TREES SWAYING BEFORE IT AND THE OTHER CANDLE IS IN JOSEPH'S GARRET
JOSEPH SITS UP LATE DOESN'T HE HE'S WAITING TILL I COME HOME THAT HE
MAY LOCK THE GATE
WELL HE'LL WAIT A WHILE YET
IT'S A ROUGH JOURNEY
AND A SAD HEART TO TRAVEL IT AND WE MUST PASS BY GIMMERTON KIRK TO GO
THAT JOURNEY WE'VE BRAVED ITS GHOSTS OFTEN TOGETHER AND DARED EACH
OTHER TO STAND AMONG THE GRAVES AND ASK THEM TO COME
BUT HEATHCLIFF
IF I DARE YOU NOW WILL YOU VENTURE IF YOU DO I'LL KEEP YOU
I'LL NOT
LIE THERE BY MYSELF THEY MAY BURY ME TWELVE FEET DEEP AND THROW THE
CHURCH DOWN OVER ME BUT I WON'T REST TILL YOU ARE WITH ME
I NEVER
WILL
SHE PAUSED AND RESUMED WITH A STRANGE SMILE
'HE'S CONSIDERING HE'D
RATHER I'D COME TO HIM FIND A WAY THEN NOT THROUGH THAT KIRKYARD
YOU
ARE SLOW BE CONTENT YOU ALWAYS FOLLOWED ME
PERCEIVING IT VAIN TO ARGUE AGAINST HER INSANITY I WAS PLANNING HOW I
COULD REACH SOMETHING TO WRAP ABOUT HER WITHOUT QUITTING MY HOLD OF
HERSELF FOR I COULD NOT TRUST HER ALONE BY THE GAPING LATTICE WHEN TO
MY CONSTERNATION I HEARD THE RATTLE OF THE DOOR HANDLE AND MR
LINTON
ENTERED
HE HAD ONLY THEN COME FROM THE LIBRARY AND IN PASSING THROUGH
THE LOBBY HAD NOTICED OUR TALKING AND BEEN ATTRACTED BY CURIOSITY OR
FEAR TO EXAMINE WHAT IT SIGNIFIED AT THAT LATE HOUR
'OH SIR I CRIED CHECKING THE EXCLAMATION RISEN TO HIS LIPS AT THE
SIGHT WHICH MET HIM AND THE BLEAK ATMOSPHERE OF THE CHAMBER
'MY POOR
MISTRESS IS ILL AND SHE QUITE MASTERS ME I CANNOT MANAGE HER AT ALL
PRAY COME AND PERSUADE HER TO GO TO BED
FORGET YOUR ANGER FOR SHE'S
HARD TO GUIDE ANY WAY BUT HER OWN
'CATHERINE ILL HE SAID HASTENING TO US
'SHUT THE WINDOW ELLEN
CATHERINE WHY
HE WAS SILENT
THE HAGGARDNESS OF MRS
LINTON'S APPEARANCE SMOTE HIM
SPEECHLESS AND HE COULD ONLY GLANCE FROM HER TO ME IN HORRIFIED
ASTONISHMENT
'SHE'S BEEN FRETTING HERE I CONTINUED 'AND EATING SCARCELY ANYTHING
AND NEVER COMPLAINING SHE WOULD ADMIT NONE OF US TILL THIS EVENING AND
SO WE COULDN'T INFORM YOU OF HER STATE AS WE WERE NOT AWARE OF IT
OURSELVES BUT IT IS NOTHING
I FELT I UTTERED MY EXPLANATIONS AWKWARDLY THE MASTER FROWNED
'IT IS
NOTHING IS IT ELLEN DEAN HE SAID STERNLY
'YOU SHALL ACCOUNT MORE
CLEARLY FOR KEEPING ME IGNORANT OF THIS AND HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS
ARMS AND LOOKED AT HER WITH ANGUISH
AT FIRST SHE GAVE HIM NO GLANCE OF RECOGNITION HE WAS INVISIBLE TO HER
ABSTRACTED GAZE
THE DELIRIUM WAS NOT FIXED HOWEVER HAVING WEANED HER
EYES FROM CONTEMPLATING THE OUTER DARKNESS BY DEGREES SHE CENTRED HER
ATTENTION ON HIM AND DISCOVERED WHO IT WAS THAT HELD HER
'AH YOU ARE COME ARE YOU EDGAR LINTON SHE SAID WITH ANGRY
ANIMATION
'YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE EVER FOUND WHEN LEAST
WANTED AND WHEN YOU ARE WANTED NEVER I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HAVE PLENTY
OF LAMENTATIONS NOW I SEE WE SHALL BUT THEY CAN'T KEEP ME FROM MY
NARROW HOME OUT YONDER MY RESTING PLACE WHERE I'M BOUND BEFORE SPRING
IS OVER THERE IT IS NOT AMONG THE LINTONS MIND UNDER THE
CHAPEL ROOF BUT IN THE OPEN AIR WITH A HEAD STONE AND YOU MAY PLEASE
YOURSELF WHETHER YOU GO TO THEM OR COME TO ME
'CATHERINE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE COMMENCED THE MASTER
'AM I NOTHING TO
YOU ANY MORE DO YOU LOVE THAT WRETCH HEATH
'HUSH CRIED MRS
LINTON
'HUSH THIS MOMENT YOU MENTION THAT NAME
AND I END THE MATTER INSTANTLY BY A SPRING FROM THE WINDOW WHAT YOU
TOUCH AT PRESENT YOU MAY HAVE BUT MY SOUL WILL BE ON THAT HILL TOP
BEFORE YOU LAY HANDS ON ME AGAIN
I DON'T WANT YOU EDGAR I'M PAST
WANTING YOU
RETURN TO YOUR BOOKS
I'M GLAD YOU POSSESS A CONSOLATION
FOR ALL YOU HAD IN ME IS GONE
'HER MIND WANDERS SIR I INTERPOSED
'SHE HAS BEEN TALKING NONSENSE
THE WHOLE EVENING BUT LET HER HAVE QUIET AND PROPER ATTENDANCE AND
SHE'LL RALLY
HEREAFTER WE MUST BE CAUTIOUS HOW WE VEX HER
'I DESIRE NO FURTHER ADVICE FROM YOU ANSWERED MR
LINTON
'YOU KNEW
YOUR MISTRESS'S NATURE AND YOU ENCOURAGED ME TO HARASS HER
AND NOT TO
GIVE ME ONE HINT OF HOW SHE HAS BEEN THESE THREE DAYS IT WAS HEARTLESS
MONTHS OF SICKNESS COULD NOT CAUSE SUCH A CHANGE
I BEGAN TO DEFEND MYSELF THINKING IT TOO BAD TO BE BLAMED FOR ANOTHER'S
WICKED WAYWARDNESS
'I KNEW MRS
LINTON'S NATURE TO BE HEADSTRONG AND
DOMINEERING CRIED I 'BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WISHED TO FOSTER HER
FIERCE TEMPER I DIDN'T KNOW THAT TO HUMOUR HER I SHOULD WINK AT MR
HEATHCLIFF
I PERFORMED THE DUTY OF A FAITHFUL SERVANT IN TELLING YOU
AND I HAVE GOT A FAITHFUL SERVANT'S WAGES WELL IT WILL TEACH ME TO BE
CAREFUL NEXT TIME
NEXT TIME YOU MAY GATHER INTELLIGENCE FOR YOURSELF
'THE NEXT TIME YOU BRING A TALE TO ME YOU SHALL QUIT MY SERVICE ELLEN
DEAN HE REPLIED
'YOU'D RATHER HEAR NOTHING ABOUT IT I SUPPOSE THEN MR
LINTON SAID
I
'HEATHCLIFF HAS YOUR PERMISSION TO COME A COURTING TO MISS AND TO
DROP IN AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY YOUR ABSENCE OFFERS ON PURPOSE TO POISON
THE MISTRESS AGAINST YOU
CONFUSED AS CATHERINE WAS HER WITS WERE ALERT AT APPLYING OUR
CONVERSATION
'AH NELLY HAS PLAYED TRAITOR SHE EXCLAIMED PASSIONATELY
'NELLY IS
MY HIDDEN ENEMY
YOU WITCH SO YOU DO SEEK ELF BOLTS TO HURT US LET
ME GO AND I'LL MAKE HER RUE I'LL MAKE HER HOWL A RECANTATION
A MANIAC'S FURY KINDLED UNDER HER BROWS SHE STRUGGLED DESPERATELY TO
DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM LINTON'S ARMS
I FELT NO INCLINATION TO TARRY THE
EVENT AND RESOLVING TO SEEK MEDICAL AID ON MY OWN RESPONSIBILITY I
QUITTED THE CHAMBER
IN PASSING THE GARDEN TO REACH THE ROAD AT A PLACE WHERE A BRIDLE HOOK
IS DRIVEN INTO THE WALL I SAW SOMETHING WHITE MOVED IRREGULARLY
EVIDENTLY BY ANOTHER AGENT THAN THE WIND
NOTWITHSTANDING MY HURRY I
STAYED TO EXAMINE IT LEST EVER AFTER I SHOULD HAVE THE CONVICTION
IMPRESSED ON MY IMAGINATION THAT IT WAS A CREATURE OF THE OTHER WORLD
MY
SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY WERE GREAT ON DISCOVERING BY TOUCH MORE THAN
VISION MISS ISABELLA'S SPRINGER FANNY SUSPENDED BY A HANDKERCHIEF AND
NEARLY AT ITS LAST GASP
I QUICKLY RELEASED THE ANIMAL AND LIFTED IT
INTO THE GARDEN
I HAD SEEN IT FOLLOW ITS MISTRESS UP STAIRS WHEN SHE
WENT TO BED AND WONDERED MUCH HOW IT COULD HAVE GOT OUT THERE AND WHAT
MISCHIEVOUS PERSON HAD TREATED IT SO
WHILE UNTYING THE KNOT ROUND THE
HOOK IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I REPEATEDLY CAUGHT THE BEAT OF HORSES' FEET
GALLOPING AT SOME DISTANCE BUT THERE WERE SUCH A NUMBER OF THINGS TO
OCCUPY MY REFLECTIONS THAT I HARDLY GAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE A THOUGHT
THOUGH IT WAS A STRANGE SOUND IN THAT PLACE AT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE
MORNING
MR
KENNETH WAS FORTUNATELY JUST ISSUING FROM HIS HOUSE TO SEE A PATIENT
IN THE VILLAGE AS I CAME UP THE STREET AND MY ACCOUNT OF CATHERINE
LINTON'S MALADY INDUCED HIM TO ACCOMPANY ME BACK IMMEDIATELY
HE WAS A
PLAIN ROUGH MAN AND HE MADE NO SCRUPLE TO SPEAK HIS DOUBTS OF HER
SURVIVING THIS SECOND ATTACK UNLESS SHE WERE MORE SUBMISSIVE TO HIS
DIRECTIONS THAN SHE HAD SHOWN HERSELF BEFORE
'NELLY DEAN SAID HE 'I CAN'T HELP FANCYING THERE'S AN EXTRA CAUSE FOR
THIS
WHAT HAS THERE BEEN TO DO AT THE GRANGE WE'VE ODD REPORTS UP
HERE
A STOUT HEARTY LASS LIKE CATHERINE DOES NOT FALL ILL FOR A
TRIFLE AND THAT SORT OF PEOPLE SHOULD NOT EITHER
IT'S HARD WORK
BRINGING THEM THROUGH FEVERS AND SUCH THINGS
HOW DID IT BEGIN
'THE MASTER WILL INFORM YOU I ANSWERED 'BUT YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH
THE EARNSHAWS' VIOLENT DISPOSITIONS AND MRS
LINTON CAPS THEM ALL
I
MAY SAY THIS IT COMMENCED IN A QUARREL
SHE WAS STRUCK DURING A TEMPEST
OF PASSION WITH A KIND OF FIT
THAT'S HER ACCOUNT AT LEAST FOR SHE
FLEW OFF IN THE HEIGHT OF IT AND LOCKED HERSELF UP
AFTERWARDS SHE
REFUSED TO EAT AND NOW SHE ALTERNATELY RAVES AND REMAINS IN A HALF
DREAM KNOWING THOSE ABOUT HER BUT HAVING HER MIND FILLED WITH ALL SORTS
OF STRANGE IDEAS AND ILLUSIONS
'MR
LINTON WILL BE SORRY OBSERVED KENNETH INTERROGATIVELY
'SORRY HE'LL BREAK HIS HEART SHOULD ANYTHING HAPPEN I REPLIED
'DON'T
ALARM HIM MORE THAN NECESSARY
'WELL I TOLD HIM TO BEWARE SAID MY COMPANION 'AND HE MUST BIDE THE
CONSEQUENCES OF NEGLECTING MY WARNING HASN'T HE BEEN INTIMATE WITH MR
HEATHCLIFF LATELY
'HEATHCLIFF FREQUENTLY VISITS AT THE GRANGE ANSWERED I 'THOUGH MORE ON
THE STRENGTH OF THE MISTRESS HAVING KNOWN HIM WHEN A BOY THAN BECAUSE
THE MASTER LIKES HIS COMPANY
AT PRESENT HE'S DISCHARGED FROM THE
TROUBLE OF CALLING OWING TO SOME PRESUMPTUOUS ASPIRATIONS AFTER MISS
LINTON WHICH HE MANIFESTED
I HARDLY THINK HE'LL BE TAKEN IN AGAIN
'AND DOES MISS LINTON TURN A COLD SHOULDER ON HIM WAS THE DOCTOR'S NEXT
QUESTION
'I'M NOT IN HER CONFIDENCE RETURNED I RELUCTANT TO CONTINUE THE
SUBJECT
'NO SHE'S A SLY ONE HE REMARKED SHAKING HIS HEAD
'SHE KEEPS HER OWN
COUNSEL BUT SHE'S A REAL LITTLE FOOL
I HAVE IT FROM GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT LAST NIGHT AND A PRETTY NIGHT IT WAS SHE AND HEATHCLIFF WERE
WALKING IN THE PLANTATION AT THE BACK OF YOUR HOUSE ABOVE TWO HOURS AND
HE PRESSED HER NOT TO GO IN AGAIN BUT JUST MOUNT HIS HORSE AND AWAY WITH
HIM MY INFORMANT SAID SHE COULD ONLY PUT HIM OFF BY PLEDGING HER WORD
OF HONOUR TO BE PREPARED ON THEIR FIRST MEETING AFTER THAT WHEN IT WAS
TO BE HE DIDN'T HEAR BUT YOU URGE MR
LINTON TO LOOK SHARP
THIS NEWS FILLED ME WITH FRESH FEARS I OUTSTRIPPED KENNETH AND RAN MOST
OF THE WAY BACK
THE LITTLE DOG WAS YELPING IN THE GARDEN YET
I SPARED
A MINUTE TO OPEN THE GATE FOR IT BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE HOUSE DOOR
IT COURSED UP AND DOWN SNUFFING THE GRASS AND WOULD HAVE ESCAPED TO THE
ROAD HAD I NOT SEIZED IT AND CONVEYED IT IN WITH ME
ON ASCENDING TO
ISABELLA'S ROOM MY SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED IT WAS EMPTY
HAD I BEEN
A FEW HOURS SOONER MRS
LINTON'S ILLNESS MIGHT HAVE ARRESTED HER RASH
STEP
BUT WHAT COULD BE DONE NOW THERE WAS A BARE POSSIBILITY OF
OVERTAKING THEM IF PURSUED INSTANTLY
I COULD NOT PURSUE THEM
HOWEVER AND I DARED NOT ROUSE THE FAMILY AND FILL THE PLACE WITH
CONFUSION STILL LESS UNFOLD THE BUSINESS TO MY MASTER ABSORBED AS HE
WAS IN HIS PRESENT CALAMITY AND HAVING NO HEART TO SPARE FOR A SECOND
GRIEF I SAW NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO HOLD MY TONGUE AND SUFFER MATTERS TO
TAKE THEIR COURSE AND KENNETH BEING ARRIVED I WENT WITH A BADLY
COMPOSED COUNTENANCE TO ANNOUNCE HIM
CATHERINE LAY IN A TROUBLED SLEEP
HER HUSBAND HAD SUCCEEDED IN SOOTHING THE EXCESS OF FRENZY HE NOW HUNG
OVER HER PILLOW WATCHING EVERY SHADE AND EVERY CHANGE OF HER PAINFULLY
EXPRESSIVE FEATURES
THE DOCTOR ON EXAMINING THE CASE FOR HIMSELF SPOKE HOPEFULLY TO HIM OF
ITS HAVING A FAVOURABLE TERMINATION IF WE COULD ONLY PRESERVE AROUND HER
PERFECT AND CONSTANT TRANQUILLITY
TO ME HE SIGNIFIED THE THREATENING
DANGER WAS NOT SO MUCH DEATH AS PERMANENT ALIENATION OF INTELLECT
I DID NOT CLOSE MY EYES THAT NIGHT NOR DID MR
LINTON INDEED WE NEVER
WENT TO BED AND THE SERVANTS WERE ALL UP LONG BEFORE THE USUAL HOUR
MOVING THROUGH THE HOUSE WITH STEALTHY TREAD AND EXCHANGING WHISPERS AS
THEY ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER IN THEIR VOCATIONS
EVERY ONE WAS ACTIVE BUT
MISS ISABELLA AND THEY BEGAN TO REMARK HOW SOUND SHE SLEPT HER BROTHER
TOO ASKED IF SHE HAD RISEN AND SEEMED IMPATIENT FOR HER PRESENCE AND
HURT THAT SHE SHOWED SO LITTLE ANXIETY FOR HER SISTER IN LAW
I TREMBLED
LEST HE SHOULD SEND ME TO CALL HER BUT I WAS SPARED THE PAIN OF BEING
THE FIRST PROCLAIMANT OF HER FLIGHT
ONE OF THE MAIDS A THOUGHTLESS
GIRL WHO HAD BEEN ON AN EARLY ERRAND TO GIMMERTON CAME PANTING
UP STAIRS OPEN MOUTHED AND DASHED INTO THE CHAMBER CRYING 'OH DEAR
DEAR WHAT MUN WE HAVE NEXT MASTER MASTER OUR YOUNG LADY
'HOLD YOUR NOISE CRIED I HASTILY ENRAGED AT HER CLAMOROUS MANNER
'SPEAK LOWER MARY WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID MR
LINTON
'WHAT AILS
YOUR YOUNG LADY
'SHE'S GONE SHE'S GONE YON' HEATHCLIFF'S RUN OFF WI' HER GASPED THE
GIRL
'THAT IS NOT TRUE EXCLAIMED LINTON RISING IN AGITATION
'IT CANNOT
BE HOW HAS THE IDEA ENTERED YOUR HEAD ELLEN DEAN GO AND SEEK HER
IT
IS INCREDIBLE IT CANNOT BE
AS HE SPOKE HE TOOK THE SERVANT TO THE DOOR AND THEN REPEATED HIS DEMAND
TO KNOW HER REASONS FOR SUCH AN ASSERTION
'WHY I MET ON THE ROAD A LAD THAT FETCHES MILK HERE SHE STAMMERED
'AND HE ASKED WHETHER WE WEREN'T IN TROUBLE AT THE GRANGE
I THOUGHT HE
MEANT FOR MISSIS'S SICKNESS SO I ANSWERED YES
THEN SAYS HE THERE'S
SOMEBODY GONE AFTER 'EM I GUESS I STARED
HE SAW I KNEW NOUGHT ABOUT
IT AND HE TOLD HOW A GENTLEMAN AND LADY HAD STOPPED TO HAVE A HORSE'S
SHOE FASTENED AT A BLACKSMITH'S SHOP TWO MILES OUT OF GIMMERTON NOT
VERY LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT AND HOW THE BLACKSMITH'S LASS HAD GOT UP TO SPY
WHO THEY WERE SHE KNEW THEM BOTH DIRECTLY
AND SHE NOTICED THE
MAN HEATHCLIFF IT WAS SHE FELT CERTAIN NOB'DY COULD MISTAKE HIM
BESIDES PUT A SOVEREIGN IN HER FATHER'S HAND FOR PAYMENT
THE LADY HAD
A CLOAK ABOUT HER FACE BUT HAVING DESIRED A SUP OF WATER WHILE SHE
DRANK IT FELL BACK AND SHE SAW HER VERY PLAIN
HEATHCLIFF HELD BOTH
BRIDLES AS THEY RODE ON AND THEY SET THEIR FACES FROM THE VILLAGE AND
WENT AS FAST AS THE ROUGH ROADS WOULD LET THEM
THE LASS SAID NOTHING TO
HER FATHER BUT SHE TOLD IT ALL OVER GIMMERTON THIS MORNING
I RAN AND PEEPED FOR FORM'S SAKE INTO ISABELLA'S ROOM CONFIRMING WHEN
I RETURNED THE SERVANT'S STATEMENT
MR
LINTON HAD RESUMED HIS SEAT BY
THE BED ON MY RE ENTRANCE HE RAISED HIS EYES READ THE MEANING OF MY
BLANK ASPECT AND DROPPED THEM WITHOUT GIVING AN ORDER OR UTTERING A
WORD
'ARE WE TO TRY ANY MEASURES FOR OVERTAKING AND BRINGING HER BACK I
INQUIRED
'HOW SHOULD WE DO
'SHE WENT OF HER OWN ACCORD ANSWERED THE MASTER 'SHE HAD A RIGHT TO GO
IF SHE PLEASED
TROUBLE ME NO MORE ABOUT HER
HEREAFTER SHE IS ONLY MY
SISTER IN NAME NOT BECAUSE I DISOWN HER BUT BECAUSE SHE HAS DISOWNED
ME
AND THAT WAS ALL HE SAID ON THE SUBJECT HE DID NOT MAKE SINGLE INQUIRY
FURTHER OR MENTION HER IN ANY WAY EXCEPT DIRECTING ME TO SEND WHAT
PROPERTY SHE HAD IN THE HOUSE TO HER FRESH HOME WHEREVER IT WAS WHEN I
KNEW IT
CHAPTER XIII
FOR TWO MONTHS THE FUGITIVES REMAINED ABSENT IN THOSE TWO MONTHS MRS
LINTON ENCOUNTERED AND CONQUERED THE WORST SHOCK OF WHAT WAS DENOMINATED
A BRAIN FEVER
NO MOTHER COULD HAVE NURSED AN ONLY CHILD MORE DEVOTEDLY
THAN EDGAR TENDED HER
DAY AND NIGHT HE WAS WATCHING AND PATIENTLY
ENDURING ALL THE ANNOYANCES THAT IRRITABLE NERVES AND A SHAKEN REASON
COULD INFLICT AND THOUGH KENNETH REMARKED THAT WHAT HE SAVED FROM THE
GRAVE WOULD ONLY RECOMPENSE HIS CARE BY FORMING THE SOURCE OF CONSTANT
FUTURE ANXIETY IN FACT THAT HIS HEALTH AND STRENGTH WERE BEING
SACRIFICED TO PRESERVE A MERE RUIN OF HUMANITY HE KNEW NO LIMITS IN
GRATITUDE AND JOY WHEN CATHERINE'S LIFE WAS DECLARED OUT OF DANGER AND
HOUR AFTER HOUR HE WOULD SIT BESIDE HER TRACING THE GRADUAL RETURN TO
BODILY HEALTH AND FLATTERING HIS TOO SANGUINE HOPES WITH THE ILLUSION
THAT HER MIND WOULD SETTLE BACK TO ITS RIGHT BALANCE ALSO AND SHE WOULD
SOON BE ENTIRELY HER FORMER SELF
THE FIRST TIME SHE LEFT HER CHAMBER WAS AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE
FOLLOWING MARCH
MR
LINTON HAD PUT ON HER PILLOW IN THE MORNING A
HANDFUL OF GOLDEN CROCUSES HER EYE LONG STRANGER TO ANY GLEAM OF
PLEASURE CAUGHT THEM IN WAKING AND SHONE DELIGHTED AS SHE GATHERED THEM
EAGERLY TOGETHER
'THESE ARE THE EARLIEST FLOWERS AT THE HEIGHTS SHE EXCLAIMED
'THEY
REMIND ME OF SOFT THAW WINDS AND WARM SUNSHINE AND NEARLY MELTED SNOW
EDGAR IS THERE NOT A SOUTH WIND AND IS NOT THE SNOW ALMOST GONE
'THE SNOW IS QUITE GONE DOWN HERE DARLING REPLIED HER HUSBAND 'AND I
ONLY SEE TWO WHITE SPOTS ON THE WHOLE RANGE OF MOORS THE SKY IS BLUE
AND THE LARKS ARE SINGING AND THE BECKS AND BROOKS ARE ALL BRIM FULL
CATHERINE LAST SPRING AT THIS TIME I WAS LONGING TO HAVE YOU UNDER THIS
ROOF NOW I WISH YOU WERE A MILE OR TWO UP THOSE HILLS THE AIR BLOWS SO
SWEETLY I FEEL THAT IT WOULD CURE YOU
'I SHALL NEVER BE THERE BUT ONCE MORE SAID THE INVALID 'AND THEN
YOU'LL LEAVE ME AND I SHALL REMAIN FOR EVER
NEXT SPRING YOU'LL LONG
AGAIN TO HAVE ME UNDER THIS ROOF AND YOU'LL LOOK BACK AND THINK YOU WERE
HAPPY TO DAY
LINTON LAVISHED ON HER THE KINDEST CARESSES AND TRIED TO CHEER HER BY
THE FONDEST WORDS BUT VAGUELY REGARDING THE FLOWERS SHE LET THE TEARS
COLLECT ON HER LASHES AND STREAM DOWN HER CHEEKS UNHEEDING
WE KNEW SHE
WAS REALLY BETTER AND THEREFORE DECIDED THAT LONG CONFINEMENT TO A
SINGLE PLACE PRODUCED MUCH OF THIS DESPONDENCY AND IT MIGHT BE PARTIALLY
REMOVED BY A CHANGE OF SCENE
THE MASTER TOLD ME TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE
MANY WEEKS' DESERTED PARLOUR AND TO SET AN EASY CHAIR IN THE SUNSHINE BY
THE WINDOW AND THEN HE BROUGHT HER DOWN AND SHE SAT A LONG WHILE
ENJOYING THE GENIAL HEAT AND AS WE EXPECTED REVIVED BY THE OBJECTS
ROUND HER WHICH THOUGH FAMILIAR WERE FREE FROM THE DREARY ASSOCIATIONS
INVESTING HER HATED SICK CHAMBER
BY EVENING SHE SEEMED GREATLY
EXHAUSTED YET NO ARGUMENTS COULD PERSUADE HER TO RETURN TO THAT
APARTMENT AND I HAD TO ARRANGE THE PARLOUR SOFA FOR HER BED TILL
ANOTHER ROOM COULD BE PREPARED
TO OBVIATE THE FATIGUE OF MOUNTING AND
DESCENDING THE STAIRS WE FITTED UP THIS WHERE YOU LIE AT PRESENT ON
THE SAME FLOOR WITH THE PARLOUR AND SHE WAS SOON STRONG ENOUGH TO MOVE
FROM ONE TO THE OTHER LEANING ON EDGAR'S ARM
AH I THOUGHT MYSELF SHE
MIGHT RECOVER SO WAITED ON AS SHE WAS
AND THERE WAS DOUBLE CAUSE TO
DESIRE IT FOR ON HER EXISTENCE DEPENDED THAT OF ANOTHER WE CHERISHED
THE HOPE THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE MR
LINTON'S HEART WOULD BE GLADDENED
AND HIS LANDS SECURED FROM A STRANGER'S GRIPE BY THE BIRTH OF AN HEIR
I SHOULD MENTION THAT ISABELLA SENT TO HER BROTHER SOME SIX WEEKS FROM
HER DEPARTURE A SHORT NOTE ANNOUNCING HER MARRIAGE WITH HEATHCLIFF
IT
APPEARED DRY AND COLD BUT AT THE BOTTOM WAS DOTTED IN WITH PENCIL AN
OBSCURE APOLOGY AND AN ENTREATY FOR KIND REMEMBRANCE AND RECONCILIATION
IF HER PROCEEDING HAD OFFENDED HIM ASSERTING THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP IT
THEN AND BEING DONE SHE HAD NOW NO POWER TO REPEAL IT
LINTON DID NOT
REPLY TO THIS I BELIEVE AND IN A FORTNIGHT MORE I GOT A LONG LETTER
WHICH I CONSIDERED ODD COMING FROM THE PEN OF A BRIDE JUST OUT OF THE
HONEYMOON
I'LL READ IT FOR I KEEP IT YET
ANY RELIC OF THE DEAD IS
PRECIOUS IF THEY WERE VALUED LIVING
DEAR ELLEN IT BEGINS I CAME LAST NIGHT TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND
HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT CATHERINE HAS BEEN AND IS YET VERY ILL
I MUST NOT WRITE TO HER I SUPPOSE AND MY BROTHER IS EITHER TOO ANGRY OR
TOO DISTRESSED TO ANSWER WHAT I SENT HIM
STILL I MUST WRITE TO
SOMEBODY AND THE ONLY CHOICE LEFT ME IS YOU
INFORM EDGAR THAT I'D GIVE THE WORLD TO SEE HIS FACE AGAIN THAT MY HEART
RETURNED TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER I LEFT IT AND
IS THERE AT THIS MOMENT FULL OF WARM FEELINGS FOR HIM AND CATHERINE I
CAN'T FOLLOW IT THOUGH THESE WORDS ARE UNDERLINED THEY NEED NOT
EXPECT ME AND THEY MAY DRAW WHAT CONCLUSIONS THEY PLEASE TAKING CARE
HOWEVER TO LAY NOTHING AT THE DOOR OF MY WEAK WILL OR DEFICIENT
AFFECTION
THE REMAINDER OF THE LETTER IS FOR YOURSELF ALONE
I WANT TO ASK YOU TWO
QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS HOW DID YOU CONTRIVE TO PRESERVE THE COMMON
SYMPATHIES OF HUMAN NATURE WHEN YOU RESIDED HERE I CANNOT RECOGNISE ANY
SENTIMENT WHICH THOSE AROUND SHARE WITH ME
THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE GREAT INTEREST IN IT IS THIS IS MR
HEATHCLIFF A MAN IF SO IS HE MAD AND IF NOT IS HE A DEVIL I
SHA'N'T TELL MY REASONS FOR MAKING THIS INQUIRY BUT I BESEECH YOU TO
EXPLAIN IF YOU CAN WHAT I HAVE MARRIED THAT IS WHEN YOU CALL TO SEE
ME AND YOU MUST CALL ELLEN VERY SOON
DON'T WRITE BUT COME AND
BRING ME SOMETHING FROM EDGAR
NOW YOU SHALL HEAR HOW I HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN MY NEW HOME AS I AM LED
TO IMAGINE THE HEIGHTS WILL BE
IT IS TO AMUSE MYSELF THAT I DWELL ON
SUCH SUBJECTS AS THE LACK OF EXTERNAL COMFORTS THEY NEVER OCCUPY MY
THOUGHTS EXCEPT AT THE MOMENT WHEN I MISS THEM
I SHOULD LAUGH AND
DANCE FOR JOY IF I FOUND THEIR ABSENCE WAS THE TOTAL OF MY MISERIES AND
THE REST WAS AN UNNATURAL DREAM
THE SUN SET BEHIND THE GRANGE AS WE TURNED ON TO THE MOORS BY THAT I
JUDGED IT TO BE SIX O'CLOCK AND MY COMPANION HALTED HALF AN HOUR TO
INSPECT THE PARK AND THE GARDENS AND PROBABLY THE PLACE ITSELF AS
WELL AS HE COULD SO IT WAS DARK WHEN WE DISMOUNTED IN THE PAVED YARD OF
THE FARM HOUSE AND YOUR OLD FELLOW SERVANT JOSEPH ISSUED OUT TO
RECEIVE US BY THE LIGHT OF A DIP CANDLE
HE DID IT WITH A COURTESY THAT
REDOUNDED TO HIS CREDIT
HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO ELEVATE HIS TORCH TO A
LEVEL WITH MY FACE SQUINT MALIGNANTLY PROJECT HIS UNDER LIP AND TURN
AWAY
THEN HE TOOK THE TWO HORSES AND LED THEM INTO THE STABLES
REAPPEARING FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOCKING THE OUTER GATE AS IF WE LIVED IN
AN ANCIENT CASTLE
HEATHCLIFF STAYED TO SPEAK TO HIM AND I ENTERED THE KITCHEN A DINGY
UNTIDY HOLE I DARESAY YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IT IT IS SO CHANGED SINCE IT
WAS IN YOUR CHARGE
BY THE FIRE STOOD A RUFFIANLY CHILD STRONG IN LIMB
AND DIRTY IN GARB WITH A LOOK OF CATHERINE IN HIS EYES AND ABOUT HIS
MOUTH
'THIS IS EDGAR'S LEGAL NEPHEW I REFLECTED 'MINE IN A MANNER I MUST
SHAKE HANDS AND YES I MUST KISS HIM
IT IS RIGHT TO ESTABLISH A GOOD
UNDERSTANDING AT THE BEGINNING
I APPROACHED AND ATTEMPTING TO TAKE HIS CHUBBY FIST SAID 'HOW DO YOU
DO MY DEAR
HE REPLIED IN A JARGON I DID NOT COMPREHEND
'SHALL YOU AND I BE FRIENDS HARETON WAS MY NEXT ESSAY AT CONVERSATION
AN OATH AND A THREAT TO SET THROTTLER ON ME IF I DID NOT 'FRAME OFF'
REWARDED MY PERSEVERANCE
'HEY THROTTLER LAD WHISPERED THE LITTLE WRETCH ROUSING A HALF BRED
BULL DOG FROM ITS LAIR IN A CORNER
'NOW WILT THOU BE GANGING HE
ASKED AUTHORITATIVELY
LOVE FOR MY LIFE URGED A COMPLIANCE I STEPPED OVER THE THRESHOLD TO WAIT
TILL THE OTHERS SHOULD ENTER
MR
HEATHCLIFF WAS NOWHERE VISIBLE AND
JOSEPH WHOM I FOLLOWED TO THE STABLES AND REQUESTED TO ACCOMPANY ME IN
AFTER STARING AND MUTTERING TO HIMSELF SCREWED UP HIS NOSE AND
REPLIED 'MIM MIM MIM DID IVER CHRISTIAN BODY HEAR AUGHT LIKE IT
MINCING UN' MUNCHING HOW CAN I TELL WHET YE SAY
'I SAY I WISH YOU TO COME WITH ME INTO THE HOUSE I CRIED THINKING HIM
DEAF YET HIGHLY DISGUSTED AT HIS RUDENESS
'NONE O' ME I GETTEN SUMMUT ELSE TO DO HE ANSWERED AND CONTINUED HIS
WORK MOVING HIS LANTERN JAWS MEANWHILE AND SURVEYING MY DRESS AND
COUNTENANCE THE FORMER A GREAT DEAL TOO FINE BUT THE LATTER I'M SURE
AS SAD AS HE COULD DESIRE WITH SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT
I WALKED ROUND THE YARD AND THROUGH A WICKET TO ANOTHER DOOR AT WHICH
I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF KNOCKING IN HOPES SOME MORE CIVIL SERVANT MIGHT
SHOW HIMSELF
AFTER A SHORT SUSPENSE IT WAS OPENED BY A TALL GAUNT
MAN WITHOUT NECKERCHIEF AND OTHERWISE EXTREMELY SLOVENLY HIS FEATURES
WERE LOST IN MASSES OF SHAGGY HAIR THAT HUNG ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HIS
EYES TOO WERE LIKE A GHOSTLY CATHERINE'S WITH ALL THEIR BEAUTY
ANNIHILATED
'WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS HERE HE DEMANDED GRIMLY
'WHO ARE YOU
'MY NAME WAS ISABELLA LINTON I REPLIED
'YOU'VE SEEN ME BEFORE SIR
I'M LATELY MARRIED TO MR
HEATHCLIFF AND HE HAS BROUGHT ME HERE I
SUPPOSE BY YOUR PERMISSION
'IS HE COME BACK THEN ASKED THE HERMIT GLARING LIKE A HUNGRY WOLF
'YES WE CAME JUST NOW I SAID 'BUT HE LEFT ME BY THE KITCHEN DOOR AND
WHEN I WOULD HAVE GONE IN YOUR LITTLE BOY PLAYED SENTINEL OVER THE
PLACE AND FRIGHTENED ME OFF BY THE HELP OF A BULL DOG
'IT'S WELL THE HELLISH VILLAIN HAS KEPT HIS WORD GROWLED MY FUTURE
HOST SEARCHING THE DARKNESS BEYOND ME IN EXPECTATION OF DISCOVERING
HEATHCLIFF AND THEN HE INDULGED IN A SOLILOQUY OF EXECRATIONS AND
THREATS OF WHAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE HAD THE 'FIEND' DECEIVED HIM
I REPENTED HAVING TRIED THIS SECOND ENTRANCE AND WAS ALMOST INCLINED TO
SLIP AWAY BEFORE HE FINISHED CURSING BUT ERE I COULD EXECUTE THAT
INTENTION HE ORDERED ME IN AND SHUT AND RE FASTENED THE DOOR
THERE
WAS A GREAT FIRE AND THAT WAS ALL THE LIGHT IN THE HUGE APARTMENT WHOSE
FLOOR HAD GROWN A UNIFORM GREY AND THE ONCE BRILLIANT PEWTER DISHES
WHICH USED TO ATTRACT MY GAZE WHEN I WAS A GIRL PARTOOK OF A SIMILAR
OBSCURITY CREATED BY TARNISH AND DUST
I INQUIRED WHETHER I MIGHT CALL
THE MAID AND BE CONDUCTED TO A BEDROOM MR
EARNSHAW VOUCHSAFED NO
ANSWER
HE WALKED UP AND DOWN WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS APPARENTLY
QUITE FORGETTING MY PRESENCE AND HIS ABSTRACTION WAS EVIDENTLY SO DEEP
AND HIS WHOLE ASPECT SO MISANTHROPICAL THAT I SHRANK FROM DISTURBING HIM
AGAIN
YOU'LL NOT BE SURPRISED ELLEN AT MY FEELING PARTICULARLY CHEERLESS
SEATED IN WORSE THAN SOLITUDE ON THAT INHOSPITABLE HEARTH AND
REMEMBERING THAT FOUR MILES DISTANT LAY MY DELIGHTFUL HOME CONTAINING
THE ONLY PEOPLE I LOVED ON EARTH AND THERE MIGHT AS WELL BE THE
ATLANTIC TO PART US INSTEAD OF THOSE FOUR MILES I COULD NOT OVERPASS
THEM I QUESTIONED WITH MYSELF WHERE MUST I TURN FOR COMFORT AND MIND
YOU DON'T TELL EDGAR OR CATHERINE ABOVE EVERY SORROW BESIDE THIS ROSE
PRE EMINENT DESPAIR AT FINDING NOBODY WHO COULD OR WOULD BE MY ALLY
AGAINST HEATHCLIFF I HAD SOUGHT SHELTER AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS ALMOST
GLADLY BECAUSE I WAS SECURED BY THAT ARRANGEMENT FROM LIVING ALONE WITH
HIM BUT HE KNEW THE PEOPLE WE WERE COMING AMONGST AND HE DID NOT FEAR
THEIR INTERMEDDLING
I SAT AND THOUGHT A DOLEFUL TIME THE CLOCK STRUCK EIGHT AND NINE AND
STILL MY COMPANION PACED TO AND FRO HIS HEAD BENT ON HIS BREAST AND
PERFECTLY SILENT UNLESS A GROAN OR A BITTER EJACULATION FORCED ITSELF
OUT AT INTERVALS
I LISTENED TO DETECT A WOMAN'S VOICE IN THE HOUSE AND
FILLED THE INTERIM WITH WILD REGRETS AND DISMAL ANTICIPATIONS WHICH AT
LAST SPOKE AUDIBLY IN IRREPRESSIBLE SIGHING AND WEEPING
I WAS NOT
AWARE HOW OPENLY I GRIEVED TILL EARNSHAW HALTED OPPOSITE IN HIS
MEASURED WALK AND GAVE ME A STARE OF NEWLY AWAKENED SURPRISE
TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF HIS RECOVERED ATTENTION I EXCLAIMED 'I'M TIRED WITH MY
JOURNEY AND I WANT TO GO TO BED WHERE IS THE MAID SERVANT DIRECT ME
TO HER AS SHE WON'T COME TO ME
'WE HAVE NONE HE ANSWERED 'YOU MUST WAIT ON YOURSELF
'WHERE MUST I SLEEP THEN I SOBBED I WAS BEYOND REGARDING
SELF RESPECT WEIGHED DOWN BY FATIGUE AND WRETCHEDNESS
'JOSEPH WILL SHOW YOU HEATHCLIFF'S CHAMBER SAID HE 'OPEN THAT
DOOR HE'S IN THERE
I WAS GOING TO OBEY BUT HE SUDDENLY ARRESTED ME AND ADDED IN THE
STRANGEST TONE 'BE SO GOOD AS TO TURN YOUR LOCK AND DRAW YOUR
BOLT DON'T OMIT IT
'WELL I SAID
'BUT WHY MR
EARNSHAW I DID NOT RELISH THE NOTION OF
DELIBERATELY FASTENING MYSELF IN WITH HEATHCLIFF
'LOOK HERE HE REPLIED PULLING FROM HIS WAISTCOAT A
CURIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED PISTOL HAVING A DOUBLE EDGED SPRING KNIFE ATTACHED
TO THE BARREL
'THAT'S A GREAT TEMPTER TO A DESPERATE MAN IS IT NOT I
CANNOT RESIST GOING UP WITH THIS EVERY NIGHT AND TRYING HIS DOOR
IF
ONCE I FIND IT OPEN HE'S DONE FOR I DO IT INVARIABLY EVEN THOUGH THE
MINUTE BEFORE I HAVE BEEN RECALLING A HUNDRED REASONS THAT SHOULD MAKE ME
REFRAIN IT IS SOME DEVIL THAT URGES ME TO THWART MY OWN SCHEMES BY
KILLING HIM
YOU FIGHT AGAINST THAT DEVIL FOR LOVE AS LONG AS YOU MAY
WHEN THE TIME COMES NOT ALL THE ANGELS IN HEAVEN SHALL SAVE HIM
I SURVEYED THE WEAPON INQUISITIVELY
A HIDEOUS NOTION STRUCK ME HOW
POWERFUL I SHOULD BE POSSESSING SUCH AN INSTRUMENT I TOOK IT FROM HIS
HAND AND TOUCHED THE BLADE
HE LOOKED ASTONISHED AT THE EXPRESSION MY
FACE ASSUMED DURING A BRIEF SECOND IT WAS NOT HORROR IT WAS
COVETOUSNESS
HE SNATCHED THE PISTOL BACK JEALOUSLY SHUT THE KNIFE
AND RETURNED IT TO ITS CONCEALMENT
'I DON'T CARE IF YOU TELL HIM SAID HE
'PUT HIM ON HIS GUARD AND
WATCH FOR HIM
YOU KNOW THE TERMS WE ARE ON I SEE HIS DANGER DOES NOT
SHOCK YOU
'WHAT HAS HEATHCLIFF DONE TO YOU I ASKED
'IN WHAT HAS HE WRONGED YOU
TO WARRANT THIS APPALLING HATRED WOULDN'T IT BE WISER TO BID HIM QUIT
THE HOUSE
'NO THUNDERED EARNSHAW 'SHOULD HE OFFER TO LEAVE ME HE'S A DEAD MAN
PERSUADE HIM TO ATTEMPT IT AND YOU ARE A MURDERESS AM I TO LOSE ALL
WITHOUT A CHANCE OF RETRIEVAL IS HARETON TO BE A BEGGAR OH
DAMNATION I WILL HAVE IT BACK AND I'LL HAVE HIS GOLD TOO AND THEN
HIS BLOOD AND HELL SHALL HAVE HIS SOUL IT WILL BE TEN TIMES BLACKER
WITH THAT GUEST THAN EVER IT WAS BEFORE
YOU'VE ACQUAINTED ME ELLEN WITH YOUR OLD MASTER'S HABITS
HE IS
CLEARLY ON THE VERGE OF MADNESS HE WAS SO LAST NIGHT AT LEAST
I
SHUDDERED TO BE NEAR HIM AND THOUGHT ON THE SERVANT'S ILL BRED
MOROSENESS AS COMPARATIVELY AGREEABLE
HE NOW RECOMMENCED HIS MOODY
WALK AND I RAISED THE LATCH AND ESCAPED INTO THE KITCHEN
JOSEPH WAS
BENDING OVER THE FIRE PEERING INTO A LARGE PAN THAT SWUNG ABOVE IT AND
A WOODEN BOWL OF OATMEAL STOOD ON THE SETTLE CLOSE BY
THE CONTENTS OF
THE PAN BEGAN TO BOIL AND HE TURNED TO PLUNGE HIS HAND INTO THE BOWL I
CONJECTURED THAT THIS PREPARATION WAS PROBABLY FOR OUR SUPPER AND BEING
HUNGRY I RESOLVED IT SHOULD BE EATABLE SO CRYING OUT SHARPLY I'LL
MAKE THE PORRIDGE I REMOVED THE VESSEL OUT OF HIS REACH AND PROCEEDED
TO TAKE OFF MY HAT AND RIDING HABIT
'MR
EARNSHAW I CONTINUED
'DIRECTS ME TO WAIT ON MYSELF I WILL
I'M NOT GOING TO ACT THE LADY
AMONG YOU FOR FEAR I SHOULD STARVE
'GOOID LORD HE MUTTERED SITTING DOWN AND STROKING HIS RIBBED
STOCKINGS FROM THE KNEE TO THE ANKLE
'IF THERE'S TO BE FRESH
ORTHERINGS JUST WHEN I GETTEN USED TO TWO MAISTERS IF I MUN HEV' A
MISTRESS SET O'ER MY HEEAD IT'S LIKE TIME TO BE FLITTING
I NIVER
DID THINK TO SEE T' DAY THAT I MUD LAVE TH' OWLD PLACE BUT I DOUBT
IT'S NIGH AT HAND
THIS LAMENTATION DREW NO NOTICE FROM ME I WENT BRISKLY TO WORK SIGHING
TO REMEMBER A PERIOD WHEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL MERRY FUN BUT COMPELLED
SPEEDILY TO DRIVE OFF THE REMEMBRANCE
IT RACKED ME TO RECALL PAST
HAPPINESS AND THE GREATER PERIL THERE WAS OF CONJURING UP ITS APPARITION
THE QUICKER THE THIBLE RAN ROUND AND THE FASTER THE HANDFULS OF MEAL
FELL INTO THE WATER
JOSEPH BEHELD MY STYLE OF COOKERY WITH GROWING
INDIGNATION
'THEAR HE EJACULATED
'HARETON THOU WILLN'T SUP THY PORRIDGE
TO NEEGHT THEY'LL BE NAUGHT BUT LUMPS AS BIG AS MY NEIVE
THEAR AGEAN
I'D FLING IN BOWL UN' ALL IF I WER YE THERE PALE T' GUILP OFF UN'
THEN YE'LL HAE DONE WI' 'T
BANG BANG
IT'S A MERCY T' BOTHOM ISN'T
DEAVED OUT
IT WAS RATHER A ROUGH MESS I OWN WHEN POURED INTO THE BASINS FOUR
HAD BEEN PROVIDED AND A GALLON PITCHER OF NEW MILK WAS BROUGHT FROM THE
DAIRY WHICH HARETON SEIZED AND COMMENCED DRINKING AND SPILLING FROM THE
EXPANSIVE LIP
I EXPOSTULATED AND DESIRED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HIS IN A
MUG AFFIRMING THAT I COULD NOT TASTE THE LIQUID TREATED SO DIRTILY
THE
OLD CYNIC CHOSE TO BE VASTLY OFFENDED AT THIS NICETY ASSURING ME
REPEATEDLY THAT 'THE BARN WAS EVERY BIT AS GOOD' AS I 'AND EVERY BIT AS
WOLLSOME AND WONDERING HOW I COULD FASHION TO BE SO CONCEITED
MEANWHILE THE INFANT RUFFIAN CONTINUED SUCKING AND GLOWERED UP AT ME
DEFYINGLY AS HE SLAVERED INTO THE JUG
'I SHALL HAVE MY SUPPER IN ANOTHER ROOM I SAID
'HAVE YOU NO PLACE YOU
CALL A PARLOUR
PARLOUR HE ECHOED SNEERINGLY PARLOUR NAY WE'VE NOA
PARLOURS
IF YAH DUNNUT LOIKE WER COMPANY THERE'S MAISTER'S UN' IF
YAH DUNNUT LOIKE MAISTER THERE'S US
'THEN I SHALL GO UP STAIRS I ANSWERED 'SHOW ME A CHAMBER
I PUT MY BASIN ON A TRAY AND WENT MYSELF TO FETCH SOME MORE MILK
WITH
GREAT GRUMBLINGS THE FELLOW ROSE AND PRECEDED ME IN MY ASCENT WE
MOUNTED TO THE GARRETS HE OPENED A DOOR NOW AND THEN TO LOOK INTO THE
APARTMENTS WE PASSED
'HERE'S A RAHM HE SAID AT LAST FLINGING BACK A CRANKY BOARD ON
HINGES
'IT'S WEEL ENEUGH TO ATE A FEW PORRIDGE IN
THERE'S A PACK O'
CORN I' T' CORNER THEAR MEETERLY CLANE IF YE'RE FEARED O' MUCKYING YER
GRAND SILK CLOES SPREAD YER HANKERCHIR O' T' TOP ON'T
THE 'RAHM' WAS A KIND OF LUMBER HOLE SMELLING STRONG OF MALT AND GRAIN
VARIOUS SACKS OF WHICH ARTICLES WERE PILED AROUND LEAVING A WIDE BARE
SPACE IN THE MIDDLE
'WHY MAN I EXCLAIMED FACING HIM ANGRILY 'THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO
SLEEP IN
I WISH TO SEE MY BED ROOM
BED RUME HE REPEATED IN A TONE OF MOCKERY
'YAH'S SEE ALL T'
BED RUMES THEAR IS YON'S MINE
HE POINTED INTO THE SECOND GARRET ONLY DIFFERING FROM THE FIRST IN BEING
MORE NAKED ABOUT THE WALLS AND HAVING A LARGE LOW CURTAINLESS BED
WITH AN INDIGO COLOURED QUILT AT ONE END
'WHAT DO I WANT WITH YOURS I RETORTED
'I SUPPOSE MR
HEATHCLIFF DOES
NOT LODGE AT THE TOP OF THE HOUSE DOES HE
'OH IT'S MAISTER HATHECLIFF'S YE'RE WANTING CRIED HE AS IF MAKING A

'YOU'VE A NICE HOUSE JOSEPH I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM OBSERVING 'AND
PLEASANT INMATES AND I THINK THE CONCENTRATED ESSENCE OF ALL THE MADNESS
IN THE WORLD TOOK UP ITS ABODE IN MY BRAIN THE DAY I LINKED MY FATE WITH
THEIRS HOWEVER THAT IS NOT TO THE PRESENT PURPOSE THERE ARE OTHER
ROOMS
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE BE QUICK AND LET ME SETTLE SOMEWHERE
HE MADE NO REPLY TO THIS ADJURATION ONLY PLODDING DOGGEDLY DOWN THE
WOODEN STEPS AND HALTING BEFORE AN APARTMENT WHICH FROM THAT HALT AND
THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF ITS FURNITURE I CONJECTURED TO BE THE BEST ONE
THERE WAS A CARPET A GOOD ONE BUT THE PATTERN WAS OBLITERATED BY DUST
A FIREPLACE HUNG WITH CUT PAPER DROPPING TO PIECES A HANDSOME
OAK BEDSTEAD WITH AMPLE CRIMSON CURTAINS OF RATHER EXPENSIVE MATERIAL AND
MODERN MAKE BUT THEY HAD EVIDENTLY EXPERIENCED ROUGH USAGE THE
VALLANCES HUNG IN FESTOONS WRENCHED FROM THEIR RINGS AND THE IRON ROD
SUPPORTING THEM WAS BENT IN AN ARC ON ONE SIDE CAUSING THE DRAPERY TO
TRAIL UPON THE FLOOR
THE CHAIRS WERE ALSO DAMAGED MANY OF THEM
SEVERELY AND DEEP INDENTATIONS DEFORMED THE PANELS OF THE WALLS
I WAS
ENDEAVOURING TO GATHER RESOLUTION FOR ENTERING AND TAKING POSSESSION
WHEN MY FOOL OF A GUIDE ANNOUNCED 'THIS HERE IS T' MAISTER'S MY
SUPPER BY THIS TIME WAS COLD MY APPETITE GONE AND MY PATIENCE
EXHAUSTED
I INSISTED ON BEING PROVIDED INSTANTLY WITH A PLACE OF
REFUGE AND MEANS OF REPOSE
'WHEAR THE DIVIL BEGAN THE RELIGIOUS ELDER
'THE LORD BLESS US THE
LORD FORGIE US WHEAR THE HELL WOLD YE GANG YE MARRED WEARISOME
NOWT YE'VE SEEN ALL BUT HARETON'S BIT OF A CHAM'ER
THERE'S NOT
ANOTHER HOILE TO LIG DOWN IN I' TH' HAHSE
I WAS SO VEXED I FLUNG MY TRAY AND ITS CONTENTS ON THE GROUND AND THEN
SEATED MYSELF AT THE STAIRS' HEAD HID MY FACE IN MY HANDS AND CRIED
'ECH ECH EXCLAIMED JOSEPH
'WEEL DONE MISS CATHY WEEL DONE MISS
CATHY HOWSIVER T' MAISTER SALL JUST TUM'LE O'ER THEM BROOKEN POTS UN'
THEN WE'S HEAR SUMMUT WE'S HEAR HOW IT'S TO BE
GOOID FOR NAUGHT
MADLING YE DESARVE PINING FRO' THIS TO CHRUSTMAS FLINGING T' PRECIOUS
GIFTS O'GOD UNDER FOOIT I' YER FLAYSOME RAGES BUT I'M MISTA'EN IF YE
SHEW YER SPERRIT LANG
WILL HATHECLIFF BIDE SICH BONNY WAYS THINK YE I
NOBBUT WISH HE MAY CATCH YE I' THAT PLISKY
I NOBBUT WISH HE MAY
AND SO HE WENT ON SCOLDING TO HIS DEN BENEATH TAKING THE CANDLE WITH
HIM AND I REMAINED IN THE DARK
THE PERIOD OF REFLECTION SUCCEEDING
THIS SILLY ACTION COMPELLED ME TO ADMIT THE NECESSITY OF SMOTHERING MY
PRIDE AND CHOKING MY WRATH AND BESTIRRING MYSELF TO REMOVE ITS EFFECTS
AN UNEXPECTED AID PRESENTLY APPEARED IN THE SHAPE OF THROTTLER WHOM I
NOW RECOGNISED AS A SON OF OUR OLD SKULKER IT HAD SPENT ITS WHELPHOOD
AT THE GRANGE AND WAS GIVEN BY MY FATHER TO MR
HINDLEY
I FANCY IT
KNEW ME IT PUSHED ITS NOSE AGAINST MINE BY WAY OF SALUTE AND THEN
HASTENED TO DEVOUR THE PORRIDGE WHILE I GROPED FROM STEP TO STEP
COLLECTING THE SHATTERED EARTHENWARE AND DRYING THE SPATTERS OF MILK
FROM THE BANISTER WITH MY POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
OUR LABOURS WERE SCARCELY
OVER WHEN I HEARD EARNSHAW'S TREAD IN THE PASSAGE MY ASSISTANT TUCKED
IN HIS TAIL AND PRESSED TO THE WALL I STOLE INTO THE NEAREST DOORWAY
THE DOG'S ENDEAVOUR TO AVOID HIM WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AS I GUESSED BY A
SCUTTER DOWN STAIRS AND A PROLONGED PITEOUS YELPING
I HAD BETTER
LUCK HE PASSED ON ENTERED HIS CHAMBER AND SHUT THE DOOR
DIRECTLY
AFTER JOSEPH CAME UP WITH HARETON TO PUT HIM TO BED
I HAD FOUND
SHELTER IN HARETON'S ROOM AND THE OLD MAN ON SEEING ME SAID 'THEY'S
RAHM FOR BOATH YE UN' YER PRIDE NOW I SUD THINK I' THE HAHSE
IT'S
EMPTY YE MAY HEV' IT ALL TO YERSELN UN' HIM AS ALLUS MAKS A THIRD I'
SICH ILL COMPANY
GLADLY DID I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS INTIMATION AND THE MINUTE I FLUNG
MYSELF INTO A CHAIR BY THE FIRE I NODDED AND SLEPT
MY SLUMBER WAS
DEEP AND SWEET THOUGH OVER FAR TOO SOON
MR
HEATHCLIFF AWOKE ME HE
HAD JUST COME IN AND DEMANDED IN HIS LOVING MANNER WHAT I WAS DOING
THERE I TOLD HIM THE CAUSE OF MY STAYING UP SO LATE THAT HE HAD THE
KEY OF OUR ROOM IN HIS POCKET
THE ADJECTIVE OUR GAVE MORTAL OFFENCE
HE SWORE IT WAS NOT NOR EVER SHOULD BE MINE AND HE'D BUT I'LL NOT
REPEAT HIS LANGUAGE NOR DESCRIBE HIS HABITUAL CONDUCT HE IS INGENIOUS
AND UNRESTING IN SEEKING TO GAIN MY ABHORRENCE I SOMETIMES WONDER AT
HIM WITH AN INTENSITY THAT DEADENS MY FEAR YET I ASSURE YOU A TIGER OR
A VENOMOUS SERPENT COULD NOT ROUSE TERROR IN ME EQUAL TO THAT WHICH HE
WAKENS
HE TOLD ME OF CATHERINE'S ILLNESS AND ACCUSED MY BROTHER OF
CAUSING IT PROMISING THAT I SHOULD BE EDGAR'S PROXY IN SUFFERING TILL HE
COULD GET HOLD OF HIM
I DO HATE HIM I AM WRETCHED I HAVE BEEN A FOOL BEWARE OF UTTERING ONE
BREATH OF THIS TO ANY ONE AT THE GRANGE
I SHALL EXPECT YOU EVERY
DAY DON'T DISAPPOINT ME ISABELLA
CHAPTER XIV
AS SOON AS I HAD PERUSED THIS EPISTLE I WENT TO THE MASTER AND INFORMED
HIM THAT HIS SISTER HAD ARRIVED AT THE HEIGHTS AND SENT ME A LETTER
EXPRESSING HER SORROW FOR MRS
LINTON'S SITUATION AND HER ARDENT DESIRE
TO SEE HIM WITH A WISH THAT HE WOULD TRANSMIT TO HER AS EARLY AS
POSSIBLE SOME TOKEN OF FORGIVENESS BY ME
'FORGIVENESS SAID LINTON
'I HAVE NOTHING TO FORGIVE HER ELLEN
YOU
MAY CALL AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS THIS AFTERNOON IF YOU LIKE AND SAY THAT I
AM NOT ANGRY BUT I'M SORRY TO HAVE LOST HER ESPECIALLY AS I CAN NEVER
THINK SHE'LL BE HAPPY
IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION MY GOING TO SEE HER
HOWEVER WE ARE ETERNALLY DIVIDED AND SHOULD SHE REALLY WISH TO OBLIGE
ME LET HER PERSUADE THE VILLAIN SHE HAS MARRIED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY
'AND YOU WON'T WRITE HER A LITTLE NOTE SIR I ASKED IMPLORINGLY
'NO HE ANSWERED
'IT IS NEEDLESS
MY COMMUNICATION WITH HEATHCLIFF'S
FAMILY SHALL BE AS SPARING AS HIS WITH MINE
IT SHALL NOT EXIST
MR
EDGAR'S COLDNESS DEPRESSED ME EXCEEDINGLY AND ALL THE WAY FROM THE
GRANGE I PUZZLED MY BRAINS HOW TO PUT MORE HEART INTO WHAT HE SAID WHEN
I REPEATED IT AND HOW TO SOFTEN HIS REFUSAL OF EVEN A FEW LINES TO
CONSOLE ISABELLA
I DARESAY SHE HAD BEEN ON THE WATCH FOR ME SINCE
MORNING I SAW HER LOOKING THROUGH THE LATTICE AS I CAME UP THE GARDEN
CAUSEWAY AND I NODDED TO HER BUT SHE DREW BACK AS IF AFRAID OF BEING
OBSERVED
I ENTERED WITHOUT KNOCKING
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A DREARY
DISMAL SCENE AS THE FORMERLY CHEERFUL HOUSE PRESENTED I MUST CONFESS
THAT IF I HAD BEEN IN THE YOUNG LADY'S PLACE I WOULD AT LEAST HAVE
SWEPT THE HEARTH AND WIPED THE TABLES WITH A DUSTER
BUT SHE ALREADY
PARTOOK OF THE PERVADING SPIRIT OF NEGLECT WHICH ENCOMPASSED HER
HER
PRETTY FACE WAS WAN AND LISTLESS HER HAIR UNCURLED SOME LOCKS HANGING
LANKLY DOWN AND SOME CARELESSLY TWISTED ROUND HER HEAD
PROBABLY SHE
HAD NOT TOUCHED HER DRESS SINCE YESTER EVENING
HINDLEY WAS NOT THERE
MR
HEATHCLIFF SAT AT A TABLE TURNING OVER SOME PAPERS IN HIS
POCKET BOOK BUT HE ROSE WHEN I APPEARED ASKED ME HOW I DID QUITE
FRIENDLY AND OFFERED ME A CHAIR
HE WAS THE ONLY THING THERE THAT
SEEMED DECENT AND I THOUGHT HE NEVER LOOKED BETTER
SO MUCH HAD
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTERED THEIR POSITIONS THAT HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE
STRUCK A STRANGER AS A BORN AND BRED GENTLEMAN AND HIS WIFE AS A
THOROUGH LITTLE SLATTERN SHE CAME FORWARD EAGERLY TO GREET ME AND HELD
OUT ONE HAND TO TAKE THE EXPECTED LETTER
I SHOOK MY HEAD
SHE WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND THE HINT BUT FOLLOWED ME TO A SIDEBOARD WHERE I WENT TO LAY
MY BONNET AND IMPORTUNED ME IN A WHISPER TO GIVE HER DIRECTLY WHAT I
HAD BROUGHT
HEATHCLIFF GUESSED THE MEANING OF HER MANOEUVRES AND
SAID 'IF YOU HAVE GOT ANYTHING FOR ISABELLA AS NO DOUBT YOU HAVE
NELLY GIVE IT TO HER
YOU NEEDN'T MAKE A SECRET OF IT WE HAVE NO
SECRETS BETWEEN US
'OH I HAVE NOTHING I REPLIED THINKING IT BEST TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AT
ONCE
'MY MASTER BID ME TELL HIS SISTER THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT EITHER
A LETTER OR A VISIT FROM HIM AT PRESENT
HE SENDS HIS LOVE MA'AM AND
HIS WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS AND HIS PARDON FOR THE GRIEF YOU HAVE
OCCASIONED BUT HE THINKS THAT AFTER THIS TIME HIS HOUSEHOLD AND THE
HOUSEHOLD HERE SHOULD DROP INTERCOMMUNICATION AS NOTHING COULD COME OF
KEEPING IT UP
MRS
HEATHCLIFF'S LIP QUIVERED SLIGHTLY AND SHE RETURNED TO HER SEAT IN
THE WINDOW
HER HUSBAND TOOK HIS STAND ON THE HEARTHSTONE NEAR ME AND
BEGAN TO PUT QUESTIONS CONCERNING CATHERINE
I TOLD HIM AS MUCH AS I
THOUGHT PROPER OF HER ILLNESS AND HE EXTORTED FROM ME BY
CROSS EXAMINATION MOST OF THE FACTS CONNECTED WITH ITS ORIGIN
I BLAMED
HER AS SHE DESERVED FOR BRINGING IT ALL ON HERSELF AND ENDED BY HOPING
THAT HE WOULD FOLLOW MR
LINTON'S EXAMPLE AND AVOID FUTURE INTERFERENCE
WITH HIS FAMILY FOR GOOD OR EVIL
'MRS
LINTON IS NOW JUST RECOVERING I SAID 'SHE'LL NEVER BE LIKE SHE
WAS BUT HER LIFE IS SPARED AND IF YOU REALLY HAVE A REGARD FOR HER
YOU'LL SHUN CROSSING HER WAY AGAIN NAY YOU'LL MOVE OUT OF THIS COUNTRY
ENTIRELY AND THAT YOU MAY NOT REGRET IT I'LL INFORM YOU CATHERINE
LINTON IS AS DIFFERENT NOW FROM YOUR OLD FRIEND CATHERINE EARNSHAW AS
THAT YOUNG LADY IS DIFFERENT FROM ME
HER APPEARANCE IS CHANGED GREATLY
HER CHARACTER MUCH MORE SO AND THE PERSON WHO IS COMPELLED OF
NECESSITY TO BE HER COMPANION WILL ONLY SUSTAIN HIS AFFECTION HEREAFTER
BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE ONCE WAS BY COMMON HUMANITY AND A SENSE
OF DUTY
'THAT IS QUITE POSSIBLE REMARKED HEATHCLIFF FORCING HIMSELF TO SEEM
CALM 'QUITE POSSIBLE THAT YOUR MASTER SHOULD HAVE NOTHING BUT COMMON
HUMANITY AND A SENSE OF DUTY TO FALL BACK UPON
BUT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT
I SHALL LEAVE CATHERINE TO HIS DUTY AND HUMANITY AND CAN YOU COMPARE
MY FEELINGS RESPECTING CATHERINE TO HIS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS HOUSE I
MUST EXACT A PROMISE FROM YOU THAT YOU'LL GET ME AN INTERVIEW WITH HER
CONSENT OR REFUSE I WILL SEE HER WHAT DO YOU SAY
'I SAY MR
HEATHCLIFF I REPLIED 'YOU MUST NOT YOU NEVER SHALL
THROUGH MY MEANS
ANOTHER ENCOUNTER BETWEEN YOU AND THE MASTER WOULD
KILL HER ALTOGETHER
'WITH YOUR AID THAT MAY BE AVOIDED HE CONTINUED 'AND SHOULD THERE BE
DANGER OF SUCH AN EVENT SHOULD HE BE THE CAUSE OF ADDING A SINGLE
TROUBLE MORE TO HER EXISTENCE WHY I THINK I SHALL BE JUSTIFIED IN GOING
TO EXTREMES I WISH YOU HAD SINCERITY ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHETHER
CATHERINE WOULD SUFFER GREATLY FROM HIS LOSS THE FEAR THAT SHE WOULD
RESTRAINS ME
AND THERE YOU SEE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN OUR FEELINGS
HAD HE BEEN IN MY PLACE AND I IN HIS THOUGH I HATED HIM WITH A HATRED
THAT TURNED MY LIFE TO GALL I NEVER WOULD HAVE RAISED A HAND AGAINST
HIM
YOU MAY LOOK INCREDULOUS IF YOU PLEASE I NEVER WOULD HAVE
BANISHED HIM FROM HER SOCIETY AS LONG AS SHE DESIRED HIS
THE MOMENT HER
REGARD CEASED I WOULD HAVE TORN HIS HEART OUT AND DRUNK HIS BLOOD BUT
TILL THEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU DON'T KNOW ME TILL THEN I WOULD
HAVE DIED BY INCHES BEFORE I TOUCHED A SINGLE HAIR OF HIS HEAD
'AND YET I INTERRUPTED 'YOU HAVE NO SCRUPLES IN COMPLETELY RUINING ALL
HOPES OF HER PERFECT RESTORATION BY THRUSTING YOURSELF INTO HER
REMEMBRANCE NOW WHEN SHE HAS NEARLY FORGOTTEN YOU AND INVOLVING HER IN
A NEW TUMULT OF DISCORD AND DISTRESS
'YOU SUPPOSE SHE HAS NEARLY FORGOTTEN ME HE SAID
'OH NELLY YOU KNOW
SHE HAS NOT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT FOR EVERY THOUGHT SHE SPENDS
ON LINTON SHE SPENDS A THOUSAND ON ME AT A MOST MISERABLE PERIOD OF MY
LIFE I HAD A NOTION OF THE KIND IT HAUNTED ME ON MY RETURN TO THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD LAST SUMMER BUT ONLY HER OWN ASSURANCE COULD MAKE ME ADMIT
THE HORRIBLE IDEA AGAIN
AND THEN LINTON WOULD BE NOTHING NOR HINDLEY
NOR ALL THE DREAMS THAT EVER I DREAMT
TWO WORDS WOULD COMPREHEND MY
FUTURE DEATH AND HELL EXISTENCE AFTER LOSING HER WOULD BE HELL
YET I WAS A FOOL TO FANCY FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE VALUED EDGAR LINTON'S
ATTACHMENT MORE THAN MINE
IF HE LOVED WITH ALL THE POWERS OF HIS PUNY
BEING HE COULDN'T LOVE AS MUCH IN EIGHTY YEARS AS I COULD IN A DAY
AND
CATHERINE HAS A HEART AS DEEP AS I HAVE THE SEA COULD BE AS READILY
CONTAINED IN THAT HORSE TROUGH AS HER WHOLE AFFECTION BE MONOPOLISED BY
HIM
TUSH HE IS SCARCELY A DEGREE DEARER TO HER THAN HER DOG OR HER
HORSE
IT IS NOT IN HIM TO BE LOVED LIKE ME HOW CAN SHE LOVE IN HIM
WHAT HE HAS NOT
'CATHERINE AND EDGAR ARE AS FOND OF EACH OTHER AS ANY TWO PEOPLE CAN BE
CRIED ISABELLA WITH SUDDEN VIVACITY
'NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO TALK IN
THAT MANNER AND I WON'T HEAR MY BROTHER DEPRECIATED IN SILENCE
'YOUR BROTHER IS WONDROUS FOND OF YOU TOO ISN'T HE OBSERVED
HEATHCLIFF SCORNFULLY
'HE TURNS YOU ADRIFT ON THE WORLD WITH
SURPRISING ALACRITY
'HE IS NOT AWARE OF WHAT I SUFFER SHE REPLIED
'I DIDN'T TELL HIM
THAT
'YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING HIM SOMETHING THEN YOU HAVE WRITTEN HAVE YOU
'TO SAY THAT I WAS MARRIED I DID WRITE YOU SAW THE NOTE
'AND NOTHING SINCE
'NO
'MY YOUNG LADY IS LOOKING SADLY THE WORSE FOR HER CHANGE OF CONDITION I
REMARKED
'SOMEBODY'S LOVE COMES SHORT IN HER CASE OBVIOUSLY WHOSE I
MAY GUESS BUT PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T SAY
'I SHOULD GUESS IT WAS HER OWN SAID HEATHCLIFF
'SHE DEGENERATES INTO
A MERE SLUT SHE IS TIRED OF TRYING TO PLEASE ME UNCOMMONLY EARLY
YOU'D
HARDLY CREDIT IT BUT THE VERY MORROW OF OUR WEDDING SHE WAS WEEPING TO
GO HOME
HOWEVER SHE'LL SUIT THIS HOUSE SO MUCH THE BETTER FOR NOT
BEING OVER NICE AND I'LL TAKE CARE SHE DOES NOT DISGRACE ME BY RAMBLING
ABROAD
'WELL SIR RETURNED I 'I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER THAT MRS
HEATHCLIFF IS
ACCUSTOMED TO BE LOOKED AFTER AND WAITED ON AND THAT SHE HAS BEEN
BROUGHT UP LIKE AN ONLY DAUGHTER WHOM EVERY ONE WAS READY TO SERVE
YOU
MUST LET HER HAVE A MAID TO KEEP THINGS TIDY ABOUT HER AND YOU MUST
TREAT HER KINDLY
WHATEVER BE YOUR NOTION OF MR
EDGAR YOU CANNOT DOUBT
THAT SHE HAS A CAPACITY FOR STRONG ATTACHMENTS OR SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
ABANDONED THE ELEGANCIES AND COMFORTS AND FRIENDS OF HER FORMER HOME
TO FIX CONTENTEDLY IN SUCH A WILDERNESS AS THIS WITH YOU
'SHE ABANDONED THEM UNDER A DELUSION HE ANSWERED 'PICTURING IN ME A
HERO OF ROMANCE AND EXPECTING UNLIMITED INDULGENCES FROM MY CHIVALROUS
DEVOTION
I CAN HARDLY REGARD HER IN THE LIGHT OF A RATIONAL CREATURE
SO OBSTINATELY HAS SHE PERSISTED IN FORMING A FABULOUS NOTION OF MY
CHARACTER AND ACTING ON THE FALSE IMPRESSIONS SHE CHERISHED
BUT AT
LAST I THINK SHE BEGINS TO KNOW ME I DON'T PERCEIVE THE SILLY SMILES
AND GRIMACES THAT PROVOKED ME AT FIRST AND THE SENSELESS INCAPABILITY OF
DISCERNING THAT I WAS IN EARNEST WHEN I GAVE HER MY OPINION OF HER
INFATUATION AND HERSELF
IT WAS A MARVELLOUS EFFORT OF PERSPICACITY TO
DISCOVER THAT I DID NOT LOVE HER
I BELIEVED AT ONE TIME NO LESSONS
COULD TEACH HER THAT AND YET IT IS POORLY LEARNT FOR THIS MORNING SHE
ANNOUNCED AS A PIECE OF APPALLING INTELLIGENCE THAT I HAD ACTUALLY
SUCCEEDED IN MAKING HER HATE ME A POSITIVE LABOUR OF HERCULES I ASSURE
YOU IF IT BE ACHIEVED I HAVE CAUSE TO RETURN THANKS
CAN I TRUST YOUR
ASSERTION ISABELLA ARE YOU SURE YOU HATE ME IF I LET YOU ALONE FOR
HALF A DAY WON'T YOU COME SIGHING AND WHEEDLING TO ME AGAIN I DARESAY
SHE WOULD RATHER I HAD SEEMED ALL TENDERNESS BEFORE YOU IT WOUNDS HER
VANITY TO HAVE THE TRUTH EXPOSED
BUT I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS THAT THE
PASSION WAS WHOLLY ON ONE SIDE AND I NEVER TOLD HER A LIE ABOUT IT
SHE
CANNOT ACCUSE ME OF SHOWING ONE BIT OF DECEITFUL SOFTNESS
THE FIRST
THING SHE SAW ME DO ON COMING OUT OF THE GRANGE WAS TO HANG UP HER
LITTLE DOG AND WHEN SHE PLEADED FOR IT THE FIRST WORDS I UTTERED WERE A
WISH THAT I HAD THE HANGING OF EVERY BEING BELONGING TO HER EXCEPT ONE
POSSIBLY SHE TOOK THAT EXCEPTION FOR HERSELF
BUT NO BRUTALITY DISGUSTED
HER I SUPPOSE SHE HAS AN INNATE ADMIRATION OF IT IF ONLY HER PRECIOUS
PERSON WERE SECURE FROM INJURY NOW WAS IT NOT THE DEPTH OF
ABSURDITY OF GENUINE IDIOTCY FOR THAT PITIFUL SLAVISH MEAN MINDED
BRACH TO DREAM THAT I COULD LOVE HER TELL YOUR MASTER NELLY THAT I
NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE MET WITH SUCH AN ABJECT THING AS SHE IS
SHE EVEN
DISGRACES THE NAME OF LINTON AND I'VE SOMETIMES RELENTED FROM PURE LACK
OF INVENTION IN MY EXPERIMENTS ON WHAT SHE COULD ENDURE AND STILL CREEP
SHAMEFULLY CRINGING BACK BUT TELL HIM ALSO TO SET HIS FRATERNAL AND
MAGISTERIAL HEART AT EASE THAT I KEEP STRICTLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE
LAW
I HAVE AVOIDED UP TO THIS PERIOD GIVING HER THE SLIGHTEST RIGHT
TO CLAIM A SEPARATION AND WHAT'S MORE SHE'D THANK NOBODY FOR DIVIDING
US
IF SHE DESIRED TO GO SHE MIGHT THE NUISANCE OF HER PRESENCE
OUTWEIGHS THE GRATIFICATION TO BE DERIVED FROM TORMENTING HER
'MR
HEATHCLIFF SAID I 'THIS IS THE TALK OF A MADMAN YOUR WIFE MOST
LIKELY IS CONVINCED YOU ARE MAD AND FOR THAT REASON SHE HAS BORNE
WITH YOU HITHERTO BUT NOW THAT YOU SAY SHE MAY GO SHE'LL DOUBTLESS
AVAIL HERSELF OF THE PERMISSION
YOU ARE NOT SO BEWITCHED MA'AM ARE
YOU AS TO REMAIN WITH HIM OF YOUR OWN ACCORD
'TAKE CARE ELLEN ANSWERED ISABELLA HER EYES SPARKLING IREFULLY THERE
WAS NO MISDOUBTING BY THEIR EXPRESSION THE FULL SUCCESS OF HER PARTNER'S
ENDEAVOURS TO MAKE HIMSELF DETESTED
'DON'T PUT FAITH IN A SINGLE WORD
HE SPEAKS
HE'S A LYING FIEND A MONSTER AND NOT A HUMAN BEING I'VE
BEEN TOLD I MIGHT LEAVE HIM BEFORE AND I'VE MADE THE ATTEMPT BUT I DARE
NOT REPEAT IT ONLY ELLEN PROMISE YOU'LL NOT MENTION A SYLLABLE OF HIS
INFAMOUS CONVERSATION TO MY BROTHER OR CATHERINE
WHATEVER HE MAY
PRETEND HE WISHES TO PROVOKE EDGAR TO DESPERATION HE SAYS HE HAS
MARRIED ME ON PURPOSE TO OBTAIN POWER OVER HIM AND HE SHA'N'T OBTAIN
IT I'LL DIE FIRST I JUST HOPE I PRAY THAT HE MAY FORGET HIS
DIABOLICAL PRUDENCE AND KILL ME THE SINGLE PLEASURE I CAN IMAGINE IS TO
DIE OR TO SEE HIM DEAD
'THERE THAT WILL DO FOR THE PRESENT SAID HEATHCLIFF
'IF YOU ARE
CALLED UPON IN A COURT OF LAW YOU'LL REMEMBER HER LANGUAGE NELLY AND
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT COUNTENANCE SHE'S NEAR THE POINT WHICH WOULD
SUIT ME
NO YOU'RE NOT FIT TO BE YOUR OWN GUARDIAN ISABELLA NOW AND
I BEING YOUR LEGAL PROTECTOR MUST RETAIN YOU IN MY CUSTODY HOWEVER
DISTASTEFUL THE OBLIGATION MAY BE
GO UP STAIRS I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
TO ELLEN DEAN IN PRIVATE
THAT'S NOT THE WAY UP STAIRS I TELL YOU
WHY THIS IS THE ROAD UPSTAIRS CHILD
HE SEIZED AND THRUST HER FROM THE ROOM AND RETURNED MUTTERING 'I HAVE
NO PITY I HAVE NO PITY THE MORE THE WORMS WRITHE THE MORE I YEARN TO
CRUSH OUT THEIR ENTRAILS IT IS A MORAL TEETHING AND I GRIND WITH
GREATER ENERGY IN PROPORTION TO THE INCREASE OF PAIN
'DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORD PITY MEANS I SAID HASTENING TO RESUME
MY BONNET
'DID YOU EVER FEEL A TOUCH OF IT IN YOUR LIFE
'PUT THAT DOWN HE INTERRUPTED PERCEIVING MY INTENTION TO DEPART
'YOU
ARE NOT GOING YET
COME HERE NOW NELLY I MUST EITHER PERSUADE OR
COMPEL YOU TO AID ME IN FULFILLING MY DETERMINATION TO SEE CATHERINE AND
THAT WITHOUT DELAY
I SWEAR THAT I MEDITATE NO HARM I DON'T DESIRE TO
CAUSE ANY DISTURBANCE OR TO EXASPERATE OR INSULT MR
LINTON I ONLY WISH
TO HEAR FROM HERSELF HOW SHE IS AND WHY SHE HAS BEEN ILL AND TO ASK IF
ANYTHING THAT I COULD DO WOULD BE OF USE TO HER
LAST NIGHT I WAS IN THE
GRANGE GARDEN SIX HOURS AND I'LL RETURN THERE TO NIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT
I'LL HAUNT THE PLACE AND EVERY DAY TILL I FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF
ENTERING
IF EDGAR LINTON MEETS ME I SHALL NOT HESITATE TO KNOCK HIM
DOWN AND GIVE HIM ENOUGH TO INSURE HIS QUIESCENCE WHILE I STAY
IF HIS
SERVANTS OPPOSE ME I SHALL THREATEN THEM OFF WITH THESE PISTOLS
BUT
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO PREVENT MY COMING IN CONTACT WITH THEM OR THEIR
MASTER AND YOU COULD DO IT SO EASILY
I'D WARN YOU WHEN I CAME AND
THEN YOU MIGHT LET ME IN UNOBSERVED AS SOON AS SHE WAS ALONE AND WATCH
TILL I DEPARTED YOUR CONSCIENCE QUITE CALM YOU WOULD BE HINDERING
MISCHIEF
I PROTESTED AGAINST PLAYING THAT TREACHEROUS PART IN MY EMPLOYER'S HOUSE
AND BESIDES I URGED THE CRUELTY AND SELFISHNESS OF HIS DESTROYING MRS
LINTON'S TRANQUILLITY FOR HIS SATISFACTION
'THE COMMONEST OCCURRENCE
STARTLES HER PAINFULLY I SAID
'SHE'S ALL NERVES AND SHE COULDN'T
BEAR THE SURPRISE I'M POSITIVE
DON'T PERSIST SIR OR ELSE I SHALL BE
OBLIGED TO INFORM MY MASTER OF YOUR DESIGNS AND HE'LL TAKE MEASURES TO
SECURE HIS HOUSE AND ITS INMATES FROM ANY SUCH UNWARRANTABLE INTRUSIONS
'IN THAT CASE I'LL TAKE MEASURES TO SECURE YOU WOMAN EXCLAIMED
HEATHCLIFF 'YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE WUTHERING HEIGHTS TILL TO MORROW
MORNING
IT IS A FOOLISH STORY TO ASSERT THAT CATHERINE COULD NOT BEAR
TO SEE ME AND AS TO SURPRISING HER I DON'T DESIRE IT YOU MUST PREPARE
HER ASK HER IF I MAY COME
YOU SAY SHE NEVER MENTIONS MY NAME AND THAT
I AM NEVER MENTIONED TO HER
TO WHOM SHOULD SHE MENTION ME IF I AM A
FORBIDDEN TOPIC IN THE HOUSE SHE THINKS YOU ARE ALL SPIES FOR HER
HUSBAND
OH I'VE NO DOUBT SHE'S IN HELL AMONG YOU I GUESS BY HER
SILENCE AS MUCH AS ANYTHING WHAT SHE FEELS
YOU SAY SHE IS OFTEN
RESTLESS AND ANXIOUS LOOKING IS THAT A PROOF OF TRANQUILLITY YOU TALK
OF HER MIND BEING UNSETTLED
HOW THE DEVIL COULD IT BE OTHERWISE IN HER
FRIGHTFUL ISOLATION AND THAT INSIPID PALTRY CREATURE ATTENDING HER
FROM DUTY AND HUMANITY FROM PITY AND CHARITY HE MIGHT AS WELL
PLANT AN OAK IN A FLOWER POT AND EXPECT IT TO THRIVE AS IMAGINE HE CAN
RESTORE HER TO VIGOUR IN THE SOIL OF HIS SHALLOW CARES LET US SETTLE IT
AT ONCE WILL YOU STAY HERE AND AM I TO FIGHT MY WAY TO CATHERINE OVER
LINTON AND HIS FOOTMAN OR WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND AS YOU HAVE BEEN
HITHERTO AND DO WHAT I REQUEST DECIDE BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON FOR
MY LINGERING ANOTHER MINUTE IF YOU PERSIST IN YOUR STUBBORN ILL NATURE
WELL MR
LOCKWOOD I ARGUED AND COMPLAINED AND FLATLY REFUSED HIM FIFTY
TIMES BUT IN THE LONG RUN HE FORCED ME TO AN AGREEMENT
I ENGAGED TO
CARRY A LETTER FROM HIM TO MY MISTRESS AND SHOULD SHE CONSENT I
PROMISED TO LET HIM HAVE INTELLIGENCE OF LINTON'S NEXT ABSENCE FROM HOME
WHEN HE MIGHT COME AND GET IN AS HE WAS ABLE I WOULDN'T BE THERE AND
MY FELLOW SERVANTS SHOULD BE EQUALLY OUT OF THE WAY
WAS IT RIGHT OR
WRONG I FEAR IT WAS WRONG THOUGH EXPEDIENT
I THOUGHT I PREVENTED
ANOTHER EXPLOSION BY MY COMPLIANCE AND I THOUGHT TOO IT MIGHT CREATE A
FAVOURABLE CRISIS IN CATHERINE'S MENTAL ILLNESS AND THEN I REMEMBERED
MR
EDGAR'S STERN REBUKE OF MY CARRYING TALES AND I TRIED TO SMOOTH AWAY
ALL DISQUIETUDE ON THE SUBJECT BY AFFIRMING WITH FREQUENT ITERATION
THAT THAT BETRAYAL OF TRUST IF IT MERITED SO HARSH AN APPELLATION
SHOULD BE THE LAST
NOTWITHSTANDING MY JOURNEY HOMEWARD WAS SADDER THAN
MY JOURNEY THITHER AND MANY MISGIVINGS I HAD ERE I COULD PREVAIL ON
MYSELF TO PUT THE MISSIVE INTO MRS
LINTON'S HAND
BUT HERE IS KENNETH I'LL GO DOWN AND TELL HIM HOW MUCH BETTER YOU ARE
MY HISTORY IS DREE AS WE SAY AND WILL SERVE TO WHILE AWAY ANOTHER
MORNING
DREE AND DREARY I REFLECTED AS THE GOOD WOMAN DESCENDED TO RECEIVE THE
DOCTOR AND NOT EXACTLY OF THE KIND WHICH I SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO AMUSE
ME
BUT NEVER MIND I'LL EXTRACT WHOLESOME MEDICINES FROM MRS
DEAN'S
BITTER HERBS AND FIRSTLY LET ME BEWARE OF THE FASCINATION THAT LURKS IN
CATHERINE HEATHCLIFF'S BRILLIANT EYES
I SHOULD BE IN A CURIOUS TAKING
IF I SURRENDERED MY HEART TO THAT YOUNG PERSON AND THE DAUGHTER TURNED
OUT A SECOND EDITION OF THE MOTHER
CHAPTER XV
ANOTHER WEEK OVER AND I AM SO MANY DAYS NEARER HEALTH AND SPRING I
HAVE NOW HEARD ALL MY NEIGHBOUR'S HISTORY AT DIFFERENT SITTINGS AS THE
HOUSEKEEPER COULD SPARE TIME FROM MORE IMPORTANT OCCUPATIONS
I'LL
CONTINUE IT IN HER OWN WORDS ONLY A LITTLE CONDENSED
SHE IS ON THE
WHOLE A VERY FAIR NARRATOR AND I DON'T THINK I COULD IMPROVE HER STYLE
IN THE EVENING SHE SAID THE EVENING OF MY VISIT TO THE HEIGHTS I KNEW
AS WELL AS IF I SAW HIM THAT MR
HEATHCLIFF WAS ABOUT THE PLACE AND I
SHUNNED GOING OUT BECAUSE I STILL CARRIED HIS LETTER IN MY POCKET AND
DIDN'T WANT TO BE THREATENED OR TEASED ANY MORE
I HAD MADE UP MY MIND
NOT TO GIVE IT TILL MY MASTER WENT SOMEWHERE AS I COULD NOT GUESS HOW
ITS RECEIPT WOULD AFFECT CATHERINE
THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT IT DID NOT
REACH HER BEFORE THE LAPSE OF THREE DAYS
THE FOURTH WAS SUNDAY AND I
BROUGHT IT INTO HER ROOM AFTER THE FAMILY WERE GONE TO CHURCH
THERE WAS
A MANSERVANT LEFT TO KEEP THE HOUSE WITH ME AND WE GENERALLY MADE A
PRACTICE OF LOCKING THE DOORS DURING THE HOURS OF SERVICE BUT ON THAT
OCCASION THE WEATHER WAS SO WARM AND PLEASANT THAT I SET THEM WIDE OPEN
AND TO FULFIL MY ENGAGEMENT AS I KNEW WHO WOULD BE COMING I TOLD MY
COMPANION THAT THE MISTRESS WISHED VERY MUCH FOR SOME ORANGES AND HE
MUST RUN OVER TO THE VILLAGE AND GET A FEW TO BE PAID FOR ON THE MORROW
HE DEPARTED AND I WENT UP STAIRS
MRS
LINTON SAT IN A LOOSE WHITE DRESS WITH A LIGHT SHAWL OVER HER
SHOULDERS IN THE RECESS OF THE OPEN WINDOW AS USUAL
HER THICK LONG
HAIR HAD BEEN PARTLY REMOVED AT THE BEGINNING OF HER ILLNESS AND NOW SHE
WORE IT SIMPLY COMBED IN ITS NATURAL TRESSES OVER HER TEMPLES AND NECK
HER APPEARANCE WAS ALTERED AS I HAD TOLD HEATHCLIFF BUT WHEN SHE WAS
CALM THERE SEEMED UNEARTHLY BEAUTY IN THE CHANGE
THE FLASH OF HER EYES
HAD BEEN SUCCEEDED BY A DREAMY AND MELANCHOLY SOFTNESS THEY NO LONGER
GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF LOOKING AT THE OBJECTS AROUND HER THEY APPEARED
ALWAYS TO GAZE BEYOND AND FAR BEYOND YOU WOULD HAVE SAID OUT OF THIS
WORLD
THEN THE PALENESS OF HER FACE ITS HAGGARD ASPECT HAVING
VANISHED AS SHE RECOVERED FLESH AND THE PECULIAR EXPRESSION ARISING FROM
HER MENTAL STATE THOUGH PAINFULLY SUGGESTIVE OF THEIR CAUSES ADDED TO
THE TOUCHING INTEREST WHICH SHE AWAKENED AND INVARIABLY TO ME I KNOW
AND TO ANY PERSON WHO SAW HER I SHOULD THINK REFUTED MORE TANGIBLE
PROOFS OF CONVALESCENCE AND STAMPED HER AS ONE DOOMED TO DECAY
A BOOK LAY SPREAD ON THE SILL BEFORE HER AND THE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE
WIND FLUTTERED ITS LEAVES AT INTERVALS
I BELIEVE LINTON HAD LAID IT
THERE FOR SHE NEVER ENDEAVOURED TO DIVERT HERSELF WITH READING OR
OCCUPATION OF ANY KIND AND HE WOULD SPEND MANY AN HOUR IN TRYING TO
ENTICE HER ATTENTION TO SOME SUBJECT WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN HER
AMUSEMENT
SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS AIM AND IN HER BETTER MOODS ENDURED
HIS EFFORTS PLACIDLY ONLY SHOWING THEIR USELESSNESS BY NOW AND THEN
SUPPRESSING A WEARIED SIGH AND CHECKING HIM AT LAST WITH THE SADDEST OF
SMILES AND KISSES
AT OTHER TIMES SHE WOULD TURN PETULANTLY AWAY AND
HIDE HER FACE IN HER HANDS OR EVEN PUSH HIM OFF ANGRILY AND THEN HE
TOOK CARE TO LET HER ALONE FOR HE WAS CERTAIN OF DOING NO GOOD
GIMMERTON CHAPEL BELLS WERE STILL RINGING AND THE FULL MELLOW FLOW OF
THE BECK IN THE VALLEY CAME SOOTHINGLY ON THE EAR
IT WAS A SWEET
SUBSTITUTE FOR THE YET ABSENT MURMUR OF THE SUMMER FOLIAGE WHICH DROWNED
THAT MUSIC ABOUT THE GRANGE WHEN THE TREES WERE IN LEAF
AT WUTHERING
HEIGHTS IT ALWAYS SOUNDED ON QUIET DAYS FOLLOWING A GREAT THAW OR A
SEASON OF STEADY RAIN
AND OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS CATHERINE WAS THINKING
AS SHE LISTENED THAT IS IF SHE THOUGHT OR LISTENED AT ALL BUT SHE HAD
THE VAGUE DISTANT LOOK I MENTIONED BEFORE WHICH EXPRESSED NO
RECOGNITION OF MATERIAL THINGS EITHER BY EAR OR EYE
'THERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU MRS
LINTON I SAID GENTLY INSERTING IT IN
ONE HAND THAT RESTED ON HER KNEE
'YOU MUST READ IT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE
IT WANTS AN ANSWER
SHALL I BREAK THE SEAL 'YES SHE ANSWERED
WITHOUT ALTERING THE DIRECTION OF HER EYES
I OPENED IT IT WAS VERY
SHORT
'NOW I CONTINUED 'READ IT SHE DREW AWAY HER HAND AND LET
IT FALL
I REPLACED IT IN HER LAP AND STOOD WAITING TILL IT SHOULD
PLEASE HER TO GLANCE DOWN BUT THAT MOVEMENT WAS SO LONG DELAYED THAT AT
LAST I RESUMED 'MUST I READ IT MA'AM IT IS FROM MR
HEATHCLIFF
THERE WAS A START AND A TROUBLED GLEAM OF RECOLLECTION AND A STRUGGLE TO
ARRANGE HER IDEAS
SHE LIFTED THE LETTER AND SEEMED TO PERUSE IT AND
WHEN SHE CAME TO THE SIGNATURE SHE SIGHED YET STILL I FOUND SHE HAD NOT
GATHERED ITS IMPORT FOR UPON MY DESIRING TO HEAR HER REPLY SHE MERELY
POINTED TO THE NAME AND GAZED AT ME WITH MOURNFUL AND QUESTIONING
EAGERNESS
'WELL HE WISHES TO SEE YOU SAID I GUESSING HER NEED OF AN
INTERPRETER
'HE'S IN THE GARDEN BY THIS TIME AND IMPATIENT TO KNOW
WHAT ANSWER I SHALL BRING
AS I SPOKE I OBSERVED A LARGE DOG LYING ON THE SUNNY GRASS BENEATH RAISE
ITS EARS AS IF ABOUT TO BARK AND THEN SMOOTHING THEM BACK ANNOUNCE BY
A WAG OF THE TAIL THAT SOME ONE APPROACHED WHOM IT DID NOT CONSIDER A
STRANGER
MRS
LINTON BENT FORWARD AND LISTENED BREATHLESSLY
THE
MINUTE AFTER A STEP TRAVERSED THE HALL THE OPEN HOUSE WAS TOO TEMPTING
FOR HEATHCLIFF TO RESIST WALKING IN MOST LIKELY HE SUPPOSED THAT I WAS
INCLINED TO SHIRK MY PROMISE AND SO RESOLVED TO TRUST TO HIS OWN
AUDACITY
WITH STRAINING EAGERNESS CATHERINE GAZED TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE
OF HER CHAMBER
HE DID NOT HIT THE RIGHT ROOM DIRECTLY SHE MOTIONED ME
TO ADMIT HIM BUT HE FOUND IT OUT ERE I COULD REACH THE DOOR AND IN A
STRIDE OR TWO WAS AT HER SIDE AND HAD HER GRASPED IN HIS ARMS
HE NEITHER SPOKE NOR LOOSED HIS HOLD FOR SOME FIVE MINUTES DURING WHICH
PERIOD HE BESTOWED MORE KISSES THAN EVER HE GAVE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE I
DARESAY BUT THEN MY MISTRESS HAD KISSED HIM FIRST AND I PLAINLY SAW
THAT HE COULD HARDLY BEAR FOR DOWNRIGHT AGONY TO LOOK INTO HER FACE
THE SAME CONVICTION HAD STRICKEN HIM AS ME FROM THE INSTANT HE BEHELD
HER THAT THERE WAS NO PROSPECT OF ULTIMATE RECOVERY THERE SHE WAS
FATED SURE TO DIE
'OH CATHY OH MY LIFE HOW CAN I BEAR IT WAS THE FIRST SENTENCE HE
UTTERED IN A TONE THAT DID NOT SEEK TO DISGUISE HIS DESPAIR
AND NOW HE
STARED AT HER SO EARNESTLY THAT I THOUGHT THE VERY INTENSITY OF HIS GAZE
WOULD BRING TEARS INTO HIS EYES BUT THEY BURNED WITH ANGUISH THEY DID
NOT MELT
'WHAT NOW SAID CATHERINE LEANING BACK AND RETURNING HIS LOOK WITH A
SUDDENLY CLOUDED BROW HER HUMOUR WAS A MERE VANE FOR CONSTANTLY VARYING
CAPRICES
'YOU AND EDGAR HAVE BROKEN MY HEART HEATHCLIFF AND YOU BOTH
COME TO BEWAIL THE DEED TO ME AS IF YOU WERE THE PEOPLE TO BE PITIED I
SHALL NOT PITY YOU NOT I
YOU HAVE KILLED ME AND THRIVEN ON IT I
THINK
HOW STRONG YOU ARE HOW MANY YEARS DO YOU MEAN TO LIVE AFTER I
AM GONE
HEATHCLIFF HAD KNELT ON ONE KNEE TO EMBRACE HER HE ATTEMPTED TO RISE
BUT SHE SEIZED HIS HAIR AND KEPT HIM DOWN
'I WISH I COULD HOLD YOU SHE CONTINUED BITTERLY 'TILL WE WERE BOTH
DEAD I SHOULDN'T CARE WHAT YOU SUFFERED
I CARE NOTHING FOR YOUR
SUFFERINGS
WHY SHOULDN'T YOU SUFFER I DO WILL YOU FORGET ME WILL
YOU BE HAPPY WHEN I AM IN THE EARTH WILL YOU SAY TWENTY YEARS HENCE
THAT'S THE GRAVE OF CATHERINE EARNSHAW I LOVED HER LONG AGO AND WAS
WRETCHED TO LOSE HER BUT IT IS PAST
I'VE LOVED MANY OTHERS SINCE MY
CHILDREN ARE DEARER TO ME THAN SHE WAS AND AT DEATH I SHALL NOT
REJOICE THAT I AM GOING TO HER I SHALL BE SORRY THAT I MUST LEAVE
THEM WILL YOU SAY SO HEATHCLIFF
'DON'T TORTURE ME TILL I'M AS MAD AS YOURSELF CRIED HE WRENCHING HIS
HEAD FREE AND GRINDING HIS TEETH
THE TWO TO A COOL SPECTATOR MADE A STRANGE AND FEARFUL PICTURE
WELL
MIGHT CATHERINE DEEM THAT HEAVEN WOULD BE A LAND OF EXILE TO HER UNLESS
WITH HER MORTAL BODY SHE CAST AWAY HER MORAL CHARACTER ALSO
HER PRESENT
COUNTENANCE HAD A WILD VINDICTIVENESS IN ITS WHITE CHEEK AND A BLOODLESS
LIP AND SCINTILLATING EYE AND SHE RETAINED IN HER CLOSED FINGERS A
PORTION OF THE LOCKS SHE HAD BEEN GRASPING
AS TO HER COMPANION WHILE
RAISING HIMSELF WITH ONE HAND HE HAD TAKEN HER ARM WITH THE OTHER AND
SO INADEQUATE WAS HIS STOCK OF GENTLENESS TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF HER
CONDITION THAT ON HIS LETTING GO I SAW FOUR DISTINCT IMPRESSIONS LEFT
BLUE IN THE COLOURLESS SKIN
'ARE YOU POSSESSED WITH A DEVIL HE PURSUED SAVAGELY 'TO TALK IN THAT
MANNER TO ME WHEN YOU ARE DYING DO YOU REFLECT THAT ALL THOSE WORDS
WILL BE BRANDED IN MY MEMORY AND EATING DEEPER ETERNALLY AFTER YOU HAVE
LEFT ME YOU KNOW YOU LIE TO SAY I HAVE KILLED YOU AND CATHERINE YOU
KNOW THAT I COULD AS SOON FORGET YOU AS MY EXISTENCE IS IT NOT
SUFFICIENT FOR YOUR INFERNAL SELFISHNESS THAT WHILE YOU ARE AT PEACE I
SHALL WRITHE IN THE TORMENTS OF HELL
'I SHALL NOT BE AT PEACE MOANED CATHERINE RECALLED TO A SENSE OF
PHYSICAL WEAKNESS BY THE VIOLENT UNEQUAL THROBBING OF HER HEART WHICH
BEAT VISIBLY AND AUDIBLY UNDER THIS EXCESS OF AGITATION
SHE SAID
NOTHING FURTHER TILL THE PAROXYSM WAS OVER THEN SHE CONTINUED MORE
KINDLY
'I'M NOT WISHING YOU GREATER TORMENT THAN I HAVE HEATHCLIFF
I ONLY
WISH US NEVER TO BE PARTED AND SHOULD A WORD OF MINE DISTRESS YOU
HEREAFTER THINK I FEEL THE SAME DISTRESS UNDERGROUND AND FOR MY OWN
SAKE FORGIVE ME COME HERE AND KNEEL DOWN AGAIN YOU NEVER HARMED ME
IN YOUR LIFE
NAY IF YOU NURSE ANGER THAT WILL BE WORSE TO REMEMBER
THAN MY HARSH WORDS WON'T YOU COME HERE AGAIN DO
HEATHCLIFF WENT TO THE BACK OF HER CHAIR AND LEANT OVER BUT NOT SO FAR
AS TO LET HER SEE HIS FACE WHICH WAS LIVID WITH EMOTION
SHE BENT ROUND
TO LOOK AT HIM HE WOULD NOT PERMIT IT TURNING ABRUPTLY HE WALKED TO
THE FIREPLACE WHERE HE STOOD SILENT WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS US
MRS
LINTON'S GLANCE FOLLOWED HIM SUSPICIOUSLY EVERY MOVEMENT WOKE A NEW
SENTIMENT IN HER
AFTER A PAUSE AND A PROLONGED GAZE SHE RESUMED
ADDRESSING ME IN ACCENTS OF INDIGNANT DISAPPOINTMENT
'OH YOU SEE NELLY HE WOULD NOT RELENT A MOMENT TO KEEP ME OUT OF THE
GRAVE
THAT IS HOW I'M LOVED WELL NEVER MIND
THAT IS NOT MY
HEATHCLIFF
I SHALL LOVE MINE YET AND TAKE HIM WITH ME HE'S IN MY
SOUL
AND ADDED SHE MUSINGLY 'THE THING THAT IRKS ME MOST IS THIS
SHATTERED PRISON AFTER ALL
I'M TIRED OF BEING ENCLOSED HERE
I'M
WEARYING TO ESCAPE INTO THAT GLORIOUS WORLD AND TO BE ALWAYS THERE NOT
SEEING IT DIMLY THROUGH TEARS AND YEARNING FOR IT THROUGH THE WALLS OF
AN ACHING HEART BUT REALLY WITH IT AND IN IT
NELLY YOU THINK YOU ARE
BETTER AND MORE FORTUNATE THAN I IN FULL HEALTH AND STRENGTH YOU ARE
SORRY FOR ME VERY SOON THAT WILL BE ALTERED
I SHALL BE SORRY FOR
YOU
I SHALL BE INCOMPARABLY BEYOND AND ABOVE YOU ALL
I WONDER HE
WON'T BE NEAR ME SHE WENT ON TO HERSELF
'I THOUGHT HE WISHED IT
HEATHCLIFF DEAR YOU SHOULD NOT BE SULLEN NOW
DO COME TO ME
HEATHCLIFF
IN HER EAGERNESS SHE ROSE AND SUPPORTED HERSELF ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR
AT THAT EARNEST APPEAL HE TURNED TO HER LOOKING ABSOLUTELY DESPERATE
HIS EYES WIDE AND WET AT LAST FLASHED FIERCELY ON HER HIS BREAST
HEAVED CONVULSIVELY
AN INSTANT THEY HELD ASUNDER AND THEN HOW THEY MET
I HARDLY SAW BUT CATHERINE MADE A SPRING AND HE CAUGHT HER AND THEY
WERE LOCKED IN AN EMBRACE FROM WHICH I THOUGHT MY MISTRESS WOULD NEVER BE
RELEASED ALIVE IN FACT TO MY EYES SHE SEEMED DIRECTLY INSENSIBLE
HE
FLUNG HIMSELF INTO THE NEAREST SEAT AND ON MY APPROACHING HURRIEDLY TO
ASCERTAIN IF SHE HAD FAINTED HE GNASHED AT ME AND FOAMED LIKE A MAD
DOG AND GATHERED HER TO HIM WITH GREEDY JEALOUSY
I DID NOT FEEL AS IF
I WERE IN THE COMPANY OF A CREATURE OF MY OWN SPECIES IT APPEARED THAT
HE WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THOUGH I SPOKE TO HIM SO I STOOD OFF AND HELD
MY TONGUE IN GREAT PERPLEXITY
A MOVEMENT OF CATHERINE'S RELIEVED ME A LITTLE PRESENTLY SHE PUT UP HER
HAND TO CLASP HIS NECK AND BRING HER CHEEK TO HIS AS HE HELD HER WHILE
HE IN RETURN COVERING HER WITH FRANTIC CARESSES SAID WILDLY
'YOU TEACH ME NOW HOW CRUEL YOU'VE BEEN CRUEL AND FALSE
WHY DID YOU
DESPISE ME WHY DID YOU BETRAY YOUR OWN HEART CATHY I HAVE NOT ONE
WORD OF COMFORT
YOU DESERVE THIS
YOU HAVE KILLED YOURSELF
YES YOU
MAY KISS ME AND CRY AND WRING OUT MY KISSES AND TEARS THEY'LL BLIGHT
YOU THEY'LL DAMN YOU
YOU LOVED ME THEN WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO LEAVE
ME WHAT RIGHT ANSWER ME FOR THE POOR FANCY YOU FELT FOR LINTON
BECAUSE MISERY AND DEGRADATION AND DEATH AND NOTHING THAT GOD OR SATAN
COULD INFLICT WOULD HAVE PARTED US YOU OF YOUR OWN WILL DID IT
I
HAVE NOT BROKEN YOUR HEART YOU HAVE BROKEN IT AND IN BREAKING IT YOU
HAVE BROKEN MINE
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR ME THAT I AM STRONG
DO I WANT
TO LIVE WHAT KIND OF LIVING WILL IT BE WHEN YOU OH GOD WOULD YOU
LIKE TO LIVE WITH YOUR SOUL IN THE GRAVE
'LET ME ALONE
LET ME ALONE SOBBED CATHERINE
'IF I'VE DONE WRONG
I'M DYING FOR IT
IT IS ENOUGH YOU LEFT ME TOO BUT I WON'T UPBRAID
YOU I FORGIVE YOU
FORGIVE ME
'IT IS HARD TO FORGIVE AND TO LOOK AT THOSE EYES AND FEEL THOSE WASTED
HANDS HE ANSWERED
'KISS ME AGAIN AND DON'T LET ME SEE YOUR EYES I
FORGIVE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ME
I LOVE MY MURDERER BUT YOURS HOW
CAN I
THEY WERE SILENT THEIR FACES HID AGAINST EACH OTHER AND WASHED BY EACH
OTHER'S TEARS
AT LEAST I SUPPOSE THE WEEPING WAS ON BOTH SIDES AS IT
SEEMED HEATHCLIFF COULD WEEP ON A GREAT OCCASION LIKE THIS
I GREW VERY UNCOMFORTABLE MEANWHILE FOR THE AFTERNOON WORE FAST AWAY
THE MAN WHOM I HAD SENT OFF RETURNED FROM HIS ERRAND AND I COULD
DISTINGUISH BY THE SHINE OF THE WESTERN SUN UP THE VALLEY A CONCOURSE
THICKENING OUTSIDE GIMMERTON CHAPEL PORCH
'SERVICE IS OVER I ANNOUNCED
'MY MASTER WILL BE HERE IN HALF AN
HOUR
HEATHCLIFF GROANED A CURSE AND STRAINED CATHERINE CLOSER SHE NEVER
MOVED
ERE LONG I PERCEIVED A GROUP OF THE SERVANTS PASSING UP THE ROAD TOWARDS
THE KITCHEN WING
MR
LINTON WAS NOT FAR BEHIND HE OPENED THE GATE
HIMSELF AND SAUNTERED SLOWLY UP PROBABLY ENJOYING THE LOVELY AFTERNOON
THAT BREATHED AS SOFT AS SUMMER
'NOW HE IS HERE I EXCLAIMED
'FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE HURRY DOWN YOU'LL
NOT MEET ANY ONE ON THE FRONT STAIRS
DO BE QUICK AND STAY AMONG THE
TREES TILL HE IS FAIRLY IN
'I MUST GO CATHY SAID HEATHCLIFF SEEKING TO EXTRICATE HIMSELF FROM
HIS COMPANION'S ARMS
'BUT IF I LIVE I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE YOU ARE
ASLEEP
I WON'T STRAY FIVE YARDS FROM YOUR WINDOW
'YOU MUST NOT GO SHE ANSWERED HOLDING HIM AS FIRMLY AS HER STRENGTH
ALLOWED
'YOU SHALL NOT I TELL YOU
'FOR ONE HOUR HE PLEADED EARNESTLY
'NOT FOR ONE MINUTE SHE REPLIED
'I MUST LINTON WILL BE UP IMMEDIATELY PERSISTED THE ALARMED
INTRUDER
HE WOULD HAVE RISEN AND UNFIXED HER FINGERS BY THE ACT SHE CLUNG FAST
GASPING THERE WAS MAD RESOLUTION IN HER FACE
'NO SHE SHRIEKED
'OH DON'T DON'T GO
IT IS THE LAST TIME EDGAR
WILL NOT HURT US
HEATHCLIFF I SHALL DIE I SHALL DIE
'DAMN THE FOOL THERE HE IS CRIED HEATHCLIFF SINKING BACK INTO HIS
SEAT
'HUSH MY DARLING HUSH HUSH CATHERINE I'LL STAY
IF HE SHOT
ME SO I'D EXPIRE WITH A BLESSING ON MY LIPS
AND THERE THEY WERE FAST AGAIN
I HEARD MY MASTER MOUNTING THE
STAIRS THE COLD SWEAT RAN FROM MY FOREHEAD I WAS HORRIFIED
'ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO HER RAVINGS I SAID PASSIONATELY
'SHE
DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SHE SAYS
WILL YOU RUIN HER BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT WIT
TO HELP HERSELF GET UP YOU COULD BE FREE INSTANTLY
THAT IS THE MOST
DIABOLICAL DEED THAT EVER YOU DID
WE ARE ALL DONE FOR MASTER
MISTRESS AND SERVANT
I WRUNG MY HANDS AND CRIED OUT AND MR
LINTON HASTENED HIS STEP AT THE
NOISE
IN THE MIDST OF MY AGITATION I WAS SINCERELY GLAD TO OBSERVE
THAT CATHERINE'S ARMS HAD FALLEN RELAXED AND HER HEAD HUNG DOWN
'SHE'S FAINTED OR DEAD I THOUGHT 'SO MUCH THE BETTER
FAR BETTER
THAT SHE SHOULD BE DEAD THAN LINGERING A BURDEN AND A MISERY MAKER TO
ALL ABOUT HER
EDGAR SPRANG TO HIS UNBIDDEN GUEST BLANCHED WITH ASTONISHMENT AND RAGE
WHAT HE MEANT TO DO I CANNOT TELL HOWEVER THE OTHER STOPPED ALL
DEMONSTRATIONS AT ONCE BY PLACING THE LIFELESS LOOKING FORM IN HIS
ARMS
'LOOK THERE HE SAID
'UNLESS YOU BE A FIEND HELP HER FIRST THEN YOU
SHALL SPEAK TO ME
HE WALKED INTO THE PARLOUR AND SAT DOWN
MR
LINTON SUMMONED ME AND
WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND AFTER RESORTING TO MANY MEANS WE MANAGED TO
RESTORE HER TO SENSATION BUT SHE WAS ALL BEWILDERED SHE SIGHED AND
MOANED AND KNEW NOBODY
EDGAR IN HIS ANXIETY FOR HER FORGOT HER HATED
FRIEND
I DID NOT
I WENT AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY AND BESOUGHT
HIM TO DEPART AFFIRMING THAT CATHERINE WAS BETTER AND HE SHOULD HEAR
FROM ME IN THE MORNING HOW SHE PASSED THE NIGHT
'I SHALL NOT REFUSE TO GO OUT OF DOORS HE ANSWERED 'BUT I SHALL STAY
IN THE GARDEN AND NELLY MIND YOU KEEP YOUR WORD TO MORROW
I SHALL BE
UNDER THOSE LARCH TREES
MIND OR I PAY ANOTHER VISIT WHETHER LINTON BE
IN OR NOT
HE SENT A RAPID GLANCE THROUGH THE HALF OPEN DOOR OF THE CHAMBER AND
ASCERTAINING THAT WHAT I STATED WAS APPARENTLY TRUE DELIVERED THE HOUSE
OF HIS LUCKLESS PRESENCE
CHAPTER XVI
ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT WAS BORN THE CATHERINE YOU SAW AT
WUTHERING HEIGHTS A PUNY SEVEN MONTHS' CHILD AND TWO HOURS AFTER THE
MOTHER DIED HAVING NEVER RECOVERED SUFFICIENT CONSCIOUSNESS TO MISS
HEATHCLIFF OR KNOW EDGAR
THE LATTER'S DISTRACTION AT HIS BEREAVEMENT
IS A SUBJECT TOO PAINFUL TO BE DWELT ON ITS AFTER EFFECTS SHOWED HOW
DEEP THE SORROW SUNK
A GREAT ADDITION IN MY EYES WAS HIS BEING LEFT
WITHOUT AN HEIR
I BEMOANED THAT AS I GAZED ON THE FEEBLE ORPHAN AND I
MENTALLY ABUSED OLD LINTON FOR WHAT WAS ONLY NATURAL PARTIALITY THE
SECURING HIS ESTATE TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER INSTEAD OF HIS SON'S
AN
UNWELCOMED INFANT IT WAS POOR THING IT MIGHT HAVE WAILED OUT OF LIFE
AND NOBODY CARED A MORSEL DURING THOSE FIRST HOURS OF EXISTENCE
WE
REDEEMED THE NEGLECT AFTERWARDS BUT ITS BEGINNING WAS AS FRIENDLESS AS
ITS END IS LIKELY TO BE
NEXT MORNING BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL OUT OF DOORS STOLE SOFTENED IN THROUGH
THE BLINDS OF THE SILENT ROOM AND SUFFUSED THE COUCH AND ITS OCCUPANT
WITH A MELLOW TENDER GLOW
EDGAR LINTON HAD HIS HEAD LAID ON THE
PILLOW AND HIS EYES SHUT
HIS YOUNG AND FAIR FEATURES WERE ALMOST AS
DEATHLIKE AS THOSE OF THE FORM BESIDE HIM AND ALMOST AS FIXED BUT HIS
WAS THE HUSH OF EXHAUSTED ANGUISH AND HERS OF PERFECT PEACE
HER BROW
SMOOTH HER LIDS CLOSED HER LIPS WEARING THE EXPRESSION OF A SMILE NO
ANGEL IN HEAVEN COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN SHE APPEARED
AND I PARTOOK
OF THE INFINITE CALM IN WHICH SHE LAY MY MIND WAS NEVER IN A HOLIER
FRAME THAN WHILE I GAZED ON THAT UNTROUBLED IMAGE OF DIVINE REST
I
INSTINCTIVELY ECHOED THE WORDS SHE HAD UTTERED A FEW HOURS BEFORE
'INCOMPARABLY BEYOND AND ABOVE US ALL WHETHER STILL ON EARTH OR NOW IN
HEAVEN HER SPIRIT IS AT HOME WITH GOD
I DON'T KNOW IF IT BE A PECULIARITY IN ME BUT I AM SELDOM OTHERWISE THAN
HAPPY WHILE WATCHING IN THE CHAMBER OF DEATH SHOULD NO FRENZIED OR
DESPAIRING MOURNER SHARE THE DUTY WITH ME
I SEE A REPOSE THAT NEITHER
EARTH NOR HELL CAN BREAK AND I FEEL AN ASSURANCE OF THE ENDLESS AND
SHADOWLESS HEREAFTER THE ETERNITY THEY HAVE ENTERED WHERE LIFE IS
BOUNDLESS IN ITS DURATION AND LOVE IN ITS SYMPATHY AND JOY IN ITS
FULNESS
I NOTICED ON THAT OCCASION HOW MUCH SELFISHNESS THERE IS EVEN
IN A LOVE LIKE MR
LINTON'S WHEN HE SO REGRETTED CATHERINE'S BLESSED
RELEASE TO BE SURE ONE MIGHT HAVE DOUBTED AFTER THE WAYWARD AND
IMPATIENT EXISTENCE SHE HAD LED WHETHER SHE MERITED A HAVEN OF PEACE AT
LAST
ONE MIGHT DOUBT IN SEASONS OF COLD REFLECTION BUT NOT THEN IN
THE PRESENCE OF HER CORPSE
IT ASSERTED ITS OWN TRANQUILLITY WHICH
SEEMED A PLEDGE OF EQUAL QUIET TO ITS FORMER INHABITANT
DO YOU BELIEVE SUCH PEOPLE ARE HAPPY IN THE OTHER WORLD SIR I'D GIVE A
GREAT DEAL TO KNOW
I DECLINED ANSWERING MRS
DEAN'S QUESTION WHICH STRUCK ME AS SOMETHING
HETERODOX
SHE PROCEEDED
RETRACING THE COURSE OF CATHERINE LINTON I FEAR WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO
THINK SHE IS BUT WE'LL LEAVE HER WITH HER MAKER
THE MASTER LOOKED ASLEEP AND I VENTURED SOON AFTER SUNRISE TO QUIT THE
ROOM AND STEAL OUT TO THE PURE REFRESHING AIR
THE SERVANTS THOUGHT ME
GONE TO SHAKE OFF THE DROWSINESS OF MY PROTRACTED WATCH IN REALITY MY
CHIEF MOTIVE WAS SEEING MR
HEATHCLIFF
IF HE HAD REMAINED AMONG THE
LARCHES ALL NIGHT HE WOULD HAVE HEARD NOTHING OF THE STIR AT THE GRANGE
UNLESS PERHAPS HE MIGHT CATCH THE GALLOP OF THE MESSENGER GOING TO
GIMMERTON
IF HE HAD COME NEARER HE WOULD PROBABLY BE AWARE FROM THE
LIGHTS FLITTING TO AND FRO AND THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF THE OUTER
DOORS THAT ALL WAS NOT RIGHT WITHIN
I WISHED YET FEARED TO FIND HIM
I FELT THE TERRIBLE NEWS MUST BE TOLD AND I LONGED TO GET IT OVER BUT
HOW TO DO IT I DID NOT KNOW
HE WAS THERE AT LEAST A FEW YARDS FURTHER
IN THE PARK LEANT AGAINST AN OLD ASH TREE HIS HAT OFF AND HIS HAIR
SOAKED WITH THE DEW THAT HAD GATHERED ON THE BUDDED BRANCHES AND FELL
PATTERING ROUND HIM
HE HAD BEEN STANDING A LONG TIME IN THAT POSITION
FOR I SAW A PAIR OF OUSELS PASSING AND REPASSING SCARCELY THREE FEET FROM
HIM BUSY IN BUILDING THEIR NEST AND REGARDING HIS PROXIMITY NO MORE
THAN THAT OF A PIECE OF TIMBER
THEY FLEW OFF AT MY APPROACH AND HE
RAISED HIS EYES AND SPOKE 'SHE'S DEAD HE SAID 'I'VE NOT WAITED FOR
YOU TO LEARN THAT
PUT YOUR HANDKERCHIEF AWAY DON'T SNIVEL BEFORE ME
DAMN YOU ALL SHE WANTS NONE OF YOUR TEARS
I WAS WEEPING AS MUCH FOR HIM AS HER WE DO SOMETIMES PITY CREATURES THAT
HAVE NONE OF THE FEELING EITHER FOR THEMSELVES OR OTHERS
WHEN I FIRST
LOOKED INTO HIS FACE I PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD GOT INTELLIGENCE OF THE
CATASTROPHE AND A FOOLISH NOTION STRUCK ME THAT HIS HEART WAS QUELLED
AND HE PRAYED BECAUSE HIS LIPS MOVED AND HIS GAZE WAS BENT ON THE
GROUND
'YES SHE'S DEAD I ANSWERED CHECKING MY SOBS AND DRYING MY CHEEKS
'GONE TO HEAVEN I HOPE WHERE WE MAY EVERY ONE JOIN HER IF WE TAKE
DUE WARNING AND LEAVE OUR EVIL WAYS TO FOLLOW GOOD
'DID SHE TAKE DUE WARNING THEN ASKED HEATHCLIFF ATTEMPTING A SNEER
'DID SHE DIE LIKE A SAINT COME GIVE ME A TRUE HISTORY OF THE EVENT
HOW DID
HE ENDEAVOURED TO PRONOUNCE THE NAME BUT COULD NOT MANAGE IT AND
COMPRESSING HIS MOUTH HE HELD A SILENT COMBAT WITH HIS INWARD AGONY
DEFYING MEANWHILE MY SYMPATHY WITH AN UNFLINCHING FEROCIOUS STARE
'HOW DID SHE DIE HE RESUMED AT LAST FAIN NOTWITHSTANDING HIS
HARDIHOOD TO HAVE A SUPPORT BEHIND HIM FOR AFTER THE STRUGGLE HE
TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TO HIS VERY FINGER ENDS
'POOR WRETCH I THOUGHT 'YOU HAVE A HEART AND NERVES THE SAME AS YOUR
BROTHER MEN WHY SHOULD YOU BE ANXIOUS TO CONCEAL THEM YOUR PRIDE
CANNOT BLIND GOD YOU TEMPT HIM TO WRING THEM TILL HE FORCES A CRY OF
HUMILIATION
'QUIETLY AS A LAMB I ANSWERED ALOUD
'SHE DREW A SIGH AND STRETCHED
HERSELF LIKE A CHILD REVIVING AND SINKING AGAIN TO SLEEP AND FIVE
MINUTES AFTER I FELT ONE LITTLE PULSE AT HER HEART AND NOTHING MORE
'AND DID SHE EVER MENTION ME HE ASKED HESITATING AS IF HE DREADED
THE ANSWER TO HIS QUESTION WOULD INTRODUCE DETAILS THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR
TO HEAR
'HER SENSES NEVER RETURNED SHE RECOGNISED NOBODY FROM THE TIME YOU LEFT
HER I SAID
'SHE LIES WITH A SWEET SMILE ON HER FACE AND HER LATEST
IDEAS WANDERED BACK TO PLEASANT EARLY DAYS
HER LIFE CLOSED IN A GENTLE
DREAM MAY SHE WAKE AS KINDLY IN THE OTHER WORLD
'MAY SHE WAKE IN TORMENT HE CRIED WITH FRIGHTFUL VEHEMENCE STAMPING
HIS FOOT AND GROANING IN A SUDDEN PAROXYSM OF UNGOVERNABLE PASSION
'WHY SHE'S A LIAR TO THE END WHERE IS SHE NOT THERE NOT IN
HEAVEN NOT PERISHED WHERE OH YOU SAID YOU CARED NOTHING FOR MY
SUFFERINGS AND I PRAY ONE PRAYER I REPEAT IT TILL MY TONGUE
STIFFENS CATHERINE EARNSHAW MAY YOU NOT REST AS LONG AS I AM LIVING
YOU SAID I KILLED YOU HAUNT ME THEN THE MURDERED DO HAUNT THEIR
MURDERERS I BELIEVE
I KNOW THAT GHOSTS HAVE WANDERED ON EARTH
BE
WITH ME ALWAYS TAKE ANY FORM DRIVE ME MAD ONLY DO NOT LEAVE ME IN
THIS ABYSS WHERE I CANNOT FIND YOU OH GOD IT IS UNUTTERABLE I
CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT MY LIFE I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT MY SOUL
HE DASHED HIS HEAD AGAINST THE KNOTTED TRUNK AND LIFTING UP HIS EYES
HOWLED NOT LIKE A MAN BUT LIKE A SAVAGE BEAST BEING GOADED TO DEATH
WITH KNIVES AND SPEARS
I OBSERVED SEVERAL SPLASHES OF BLOOD ABOUT THE
BARK OF THE TREE AND HIS HAND AND FOREHEAD WERE BOTH STAINED PROBABLY
THE SCENE I WITNESSED WAS A REPETITION OF OTHERS ACTED DURING THE NIGHT
IT HARDLY MOVED MY COMPASSION IT APPALLED ME STILL I FELT RELUCTANT TO
QUIT HIM SO
BUT THE MOMENT HE RECOLLECTED HIMSELF ENOUGH TO NOTICE ME
WATCHING HE THUNDERED A COMMAND FOR ME TO GO AND I OBEYED
HE WAS
BEYOND MY SKILL TO QUIET OR CONSOLE
MRS
LINTON'S FUNERAL WAS APPOINTED TO TAKE PLACE ON THE FRIDAY FOLLOWING
HER DECEASE AND TILL THEN HER COFFIN REMAINED UNCOVERED AND STREWN WITH
FLOWERS AND SCENTED LEAVES IN THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM
LINTON SPENT HIS
DAYS AND NIGHTS THERE A SLEEPLESS GUARDIAN AND A CIRCUMSTANCE
CONCEALED FROM ALL BUT ME HEATHCLIFF SPENT HIS NIGHTS AT LEAST
OUTSIDE EQUALLY A STRANGER TO REPOSE
I HELD NO COMMUNICATION WITH HIM
STILL I WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS DESIGN TO ENTER IF HE COULD AND ON THE
TUESDAY A LITTLE AFTER DARK WHEN MY MASTER FROM SHEER FATIGUE HAD
BEEN COMPELLED TO RETIRE A COUPLE OF HOURS I WENT AND OPENED ONE OF THE
WINDOWS MOVED BY HIS PERSEVERANCE TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE OF BESTOWING ON
THE FADED IMAGE OF HIS IDOL ONE FINAL ADIEU
HE DID NOT OMIT TO AVAIL
HIMSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY CAUTIOUSLY AND BRIEFLY TOO CAUTIOUSLY TO
BETRAY HIS PRESENCE BY THE SLIGHTEST NOISE
INDEED I SHOULDN'T HAVE
DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE EXCEPT FOR THE DISARRANGEMENT OF THE
DRAPERY ABOUT THE CORPSE'S FACE AND FOR OBSERVING ON THE FLOOR A CURL OF
LIGHT HAIR FASTENED WITH A SILVER THREAD WHICH ON EXAMINATION I
ASCERTAINED TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM A LOCKET HUNG ROUND CATHERINE'S NECK
HEATHCLIFF HAD OPENED THE TRINKET AND CAST OUT ITS CONTENTS REPLACING
THEM BY A BLACK LOCK OF HIS OWN
I TWISTED THE TWO AND ENCLOSED THEM
TOGETHER
MR
EARNSHAW WAS OF COURSE INVITED TO ATTEND THE REMAINS OF HIS SISTER
TO THE GRAVE HE SENT NO EXCUSE BUT HE NEVER CAME SO THAT BESIDES HER
HUSBAND THE MOURNERS WERE WHOLLY COMPOSED OF TENANTS AND SERVANTS
ISABELLA WAS NOT ASKED
THE PLACE OF CATHERINE'S INTERMENT TO THE SURPRISE OF THE VILLAGERS WAS
NEITHER IN THE CHAPEL UNDER THE CARVED MONUMENT OF THE LINTONS NOR YET
BY THE TOMBS OF HER OWN RELATIONS OUTSIDE
IT WAS DUG ON A GREEN SLOPE
IN A CORNER OF THE KIRK YARD WHERE THE WALL IS SO LOW THAT HEATH AND
BILBERRY PLANTS HAVE CLIMBED OVER IT FROM THE MOOR AND PEAT MOULD ALMOST
BURIES IT
HER HUSBAND LIES IN THE SAME SPOT NOW AND THEY HAVE EACH A
SIMPLE HEADSTONE ABOVE AND A PLAIN GREY BLOCK AT THEIR FEET TO MARK THE
GRAVES
CHAPTER XVII
THAT FRIDAY MADE THE LAST OF OUR FINE DAYS FOR A MONTH
IN THE EVENING
THE WEATHER BROKE THE WIND SHIFTED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH EAST AND BROUGHT
RAIN FIRST AND THEN SLEET AND SNOW
ON THE MORROW ONE COULD HARDLY
IMAGINE THAT THERE HAD BEEN THREE WEEKS OF SUMMER THE PRIMROSES AND
CROCUSES WERE HIDDEN UNDER WINTRY DRIFTS THE LARKS WERE SILENT THE
YOUNG LEAVES OF THE EARLY TREES SMITTEN AND BLACKENED
AND DREARY AND
CHILL AND DISMAL THAT MORROW DID CREEP OVER MY MASTER KEPT HIS ROOM
I TOOK POSSESSION OF THE LONELY PARLOUR CONVERTING IT INTO A NURSERY
AND THERE I WAS SITTING WITH THE MOANING DOLL OF A CHILD LAID ON MY
KNEE ROCKING IT TO AND FRO AND WATCHING MEANWHILE THE STILL DRIVING
FLAKES BUILD UP THE UNCURTAINED WINDOW WHEN THE DOOR OPENED AND SOME
PERSON ENTERED OUT OF BREATH AND LAUGHING MY ANGER WAS GREATER THAN MY
ASTONISHMENT FOR A MINUTE
I SUPPOSED IT ONE OF THE MAIDS AND I
CRIED 'HAVE DONE HOW DARE YOU SHOW YOUR GIDDINESS HERE WHAT WOULD MR
LINTON SAY IF HE HEARD YOU
'EXCUSE ME ANSWERED A FAMILIAR VOICE 'BUT I KNOW EDGAR IS IN BED AND
I CANNOT STOP MYSELF
WITH THAT THE SPEAKER CAME FORWARD TO THE FIRE PANTING AND HOLDING HER
HAND TO HER SIDE
'I HAVE RUN THE WHOLE WAY FROM WUTHERING HEIGHTS SHE CONTINUED AFTER A
PAUSE 'EXCEPT WHERE I'VE FLOWN
I COULDN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF FALLS
I'VE HAD
OH I'M ACHING ALL OVER DON'T BE ALARMED THERE SHALL BE AN
EXPLANATION AS SOON AS I CAN GIVE IT ONLY JUST HAVE THE GOODNESS TO STEP
OUT AND ORDER THE CARRIAGE TO TAKE ME ON TO GIMMERTON AND TELL A SERVANT
TO SEEK UP A FEW CLOTHES IN MY WARDROBE
THE INTRUDER WAS MRS
HEATHCLIFF
SHE CERTAINLY SEEMED IN NO LAUGHING
PREDICAMENT HER HAIR STREAMED ON HER SHOULDERS DRIPPING WITH SNOW AND
WATER SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE GIRLISH DRESS SHE COMMONLY WORE BEFITTING
HER AGE MORE THAN HER POSITION A LOW FROCK WITH SHORT SLEEVES AND
NOTHING ON EITHER HEAD OR NECK
THE FROCK WAS OF LIGHT SILK AND CLUNG
TO HER WITH WET AND HER FEET WERE PROTECTED MERELY BY THIN SLIPPERS ADD
TO THIS A DEEP CUT UNDER ONE EAR WHICH ONLY THE COLD PREVENTED FROM
BLEEDING PROFUSELY A WHITE FACE SCRATCHED AND BRUISED AND A FRAME
HARDLY ABLE TO SUPPORT ITSELF THROUGH FATIGUE AND YOU MAY FANCY MY FIRST
FRIGHT WAS NOT MUCH ALLAYED WHEN I HAD HAD LEISURE TO EXAMINE HER
'MY DEAR YOUNG LADY I EXCLAIMED 'I'LL STIR NOWHERE AND HEAR NOTHING
TILL YOU HAVE REMOVED EVERY ARTICLE OF YOUR CLOTHES AND PUT ON DRY
THINGS AND CERTAINLY YOU SHALL NOT GO TO GIMMERTON TO NIGHT SO IT IS
NEEDLESS TO ORDER THE CARRIAGE
'CERTAINLY I SHALL SHE SAID 'WALKING OR RIDING YET I'VE NO OBJECTION
TO DRESS MYSELF DECENTLY
AND AH SEE HOW IT FLOWS DOWN MY NECK NOW
THE FIRE DOES MAKE IT SMART
SHE INSISTED ON MY FULFILLING HER DIRECTIONS BEFORE SHE WOULD LET ME
TOUCH HER AND NOT TILL AFTER THE COACHMAN HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO GET
READY AND A MAID SET TO PACK UP SOME NECESSARY ATTIRE DID I OBTAIN HER
CONSENT FOR BINDING THE WOUND AND HELPING TO CHANGE HER GARMENTS
'NOW ELLEN SHE SAID WHEN MY TASK WAS FINISHED AND SHE WAS SEATED IN
AN EASY CHAIR ON THE HEARTH WITH A CUP OF TEA BEFORE HER 'YOU SIT DOWN
OPPOSITE ME AND PUT POOR CATHERINE'S BABY AWAY I DON'T LIKE TO SEE IT
YOU MUSTN'T THINK I CARE LITTLE FOR CATHERINE BECAUSE I BEHAVED SO
FOOLISHLY ON ENTERING I'VE CRIED TOO BITTERLY YES MORE THAN ANY ONE
ELSE HAS REASON TO CRY
WE PARTED UNRECONCILED YOU REMEMBER AND I
SHA'N'T FORGIVE MYSELF
BUT FOR ALL THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO SYMPATHISE
WITH HIM THE BRUTE BEAST OH GIVE ME THE POKER THIS IS THE LAST
THING OF HIS I HAVE ABOUT ME SHE SLIPPED THE GOLD RING FROM HER THIRD
FINGER AND THREW IT ON THE FLOOR
'I'LL SMASH IT SHE CONTINUED
STRIKING IT WITH CHILDISH SPITE 'AND THEN I'LL BURN IT AND SHE TOOK
AND DROPPED THE MISUSED ARTICLE AMONG THE COALS
'THERE HE SHALL BUY
ANOTHER IF HE GETS ME BACK AGAIN
HE'D BE CAPABLE OF COMING TO SEEK ME
TO TEASE EDGAR
I DARE NOT STAY LEST THAT NOTION SHOULD POSSESS HIS
WICKED HEAD AND BESIDES EDGAR HAS NOT BEEN KIND HAS HE AND I WON'T
COME SUING FOR HIS ASSISTANCE NOR WILL I BRING HIM INTO MORE TROUBLE
NECESSITY COMPELLED ME TO SEEK SHELTER HERE THOUGH IF I HAD NOT LEARNED
HE WAS OUT OF THE WAY I'D HAVE HALTED AT THE KITCHEN WASHED MY FACE
WARMED MYSELF GOT YOU TO BRING WHAT I WANTED AND DEPARTED AGAIN TO
ANYWHERE OUT OF THE REACH OF MY ACCURSED OF THAT INCARNATE GOBLIN AH
HE WAS IN SUCH A FURY IF HE HAD CAUGHT ME IT'S A PITY EARNSHAW IS NOT
HIS MATCH IN STRENGTH I WOULDN'T HAVE RUN TILL I'D SEEN HIM ALL BUT
DEMOLISHED HAD HINDLEY BEEN ABLE TO DO IT
'WELL DON'T TALK SO FAST MISS I INTERRUPTED 'YOU'LL DISORDER THE
HANDKERCHIEF I HAVE TIED ROUND YOUR FACE AND MAKE THE CUT BLEED AGAIN
DRINK YOUR TEA AND TAKE BREATH AND GIVE OVER LAUGHING LAUGHTER IS
SADLY OUT OF PLACE UNDER THIS ROOF AND IN YOUR CONDITION
'AN UNDENIABLE TRUTH SHE REPLIED
'LISTEN TO THAT CHILD IT MAINTAINS
A CONSTANT WAIL SEND IT OUT OF MY HEARING FOR AN HOUR I SHA'N'T STAY
ANY LONGER
I RANG THE BELL AND COMMITTED IT TO A SERVANT'S CARE AND THEN I
INQUIRED WHAT HAD URGED HER TO ESCAPE FROM WUTHERING HEIGHTS IN SUCH AN
UNLIKELY PLIGHT AND WHERE SHE MEANT TO GO AS SHE REFUSED REMAINING WITH
US
'I OUGHT AND I WISHED TO REMAIN ANSWERED SHE 'TO CHEER EDGAR AND TAKE
CARE OF THE BABY FOR TWO THINGS AND BECAUSE THE GRANGE IS MY RIGHT
HOME
BUT I TELL YOU HE WOULDN'T LET ME DO YOU THINK HE COULD BEAR TO
SEE ME GROW FAT AND MERRY COULD BEAR TO THINK THAT WE WERE TRANQUIL AND
NOT RESOLVE ON POISONING OUR COMFORT NOW I HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF
BEING SURE THAT HE DETESTS ME TO THE POINT OF ITS ANNOYING HIM SERIOUSLY
TO HAVE ME WITHIN EAR SHOT OR EYESIGHT I NOTICE WHEN I ENTER HIS
PRESENCE THE MUSCLES OF HIS COUNTENANCE ARE INVOLUNTARILY DISTORTED INTO
AN EXPRESSION OF HATRED PARTLY ARISING FROM HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOOD
CAUSES I HAVE TO FEEL THAT SENTIMENT FOR HIM AND PARTLY FROM ORIGINAL
AVERSION
IT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE ME FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT HE
WOULD NOT CHASE ME OVER ENGLAND SUPPOSING I CONTRIVED A CLEAR ESCAPE
AND THEREFORE I MUST GET QUITE AWAY
I'VE RECOVERED FROM MY FIRST DESIRE
TO BE KILLED BY HIM I'D RATHER HE'D KILL HIMSELF HE HAS EXTINGUISHED
MY LOVE EFFECTUALLY AND SO I'M AT MY EASE
I CAN RECOLLECT YET HOW I
LOVED HIM AND CAN DIMLY IMAGINE THAT I COULD STILL BE LOVING HIM IF NO
NO EVEN IF HE HAD DOTED ON ME THE DEVILISH NATURE WOULD HAVE REVEALED
ITS EXISTENCE SOMEHOW
CATHERINE HAD AN AWFULLY PERVERTED TASTE TO
ESTEEM HIM SO DEARLY KNOWING HIM SO WELL
MONSTER WOULD THAT HE COULD
BE BLOTTED OUT OF CREATION AND OUT OF MY MEMORY
'HUSH HUSH HE'S A HUMAN BEING I SAID
'BE MORE CHARITABLE THERE
ARE WORSE MEN THAN HE IS YET
'HE'S NOT A HUMAN BEING SHE RETORTED 'AND HE HAS NO CLAIM ON MY
CHARITY
I GAVE HIM MY HEART AND HE TOOK AND PINCHED IT TO DEATH AND
FLUNG IT BACK TO ME
PEOPLE FEEL WITH THEIR HEARTS ELLEN AND SINCE HE
HAS DESTROYED MINE I HAVE NOT POWER TO FEEL FOR HIM AND I WOULD NOT
THOUGH HE GROANED FROM THIS TO HIS DYING DAY AND WEPT TEARS OF BLOOD FOR
CATHERINE NO INDEED INDEED I WOULDN'T AND HERE ISABELLA BEGAN TO
CRY BUT IMMEDIATELY DASHING THE WATER FROM HER LASHES SHE RECOMMENCED
'YOU ASKED WHAT HAS DRIVEN ME TO FLIGHT AT LAST I WAS COMPELLED TO
ATTEMPT IT BECAUSE I HAD SUCCEEDED IN ROUSING HIS RAGE A PITCH ABOVE HIS
MALIGNITY
PULLING OUT THE NERVES WITH RED HOT PINCERS REQUIRES MORE
COOLNESS THAN KNOCKING ON THE HEAD
HE WAS WORKED UP TO FORGET THE
FIENDISH PRUDENCE HE BOASTED OF AND PROCEEDED TO MURDEROUS VIOLENCE
I
EXPERIENCED PLEASURE IN BEING ABLE TO EXASPERATE HIM THE SENSE OF
PLEASURE WOKE MY INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION SO I FAIRLY BROKE FREE
AND IF EVER I COME INTO HIS HANDS AGAIN HE IS WELCOME TO A SIGNAL
REVENGE
'YESTERDAY YOU KNOW MR
EARNSHAW SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE FUNERAL
HE
KEPT HIMSELF SOBER FOR THE PURPOSE TOLERABLY SOBER NOT GOING TO BED MAD
AT SIX O'CLOCK AND GETTING UP DRUNK AT TWELVE
CONSEQUENTLY HE ROSE IN
SUICIDAL LOW SPIRITS AS FIT FOR THE CHURCH AS FOR A DANCE AND INSTEAD
HE SAT DOWN BY THE FIRE AND SWALLOWED GIN OR BRANDY BY TUMBLERFULS
'HEATHCLIFF I SHUDDER TO NAME HIM HAS BEEN A STRANGER IN THE HOUSE FROM
LAST SUNDAY TILL TO DAY
WHETHER THE ANGELS HAVE FED HIM OR HIS KIN
BENEATH I CANNOT TELL BUT HE HAS NOT EATEN A MEAL WITH US FOR NEARLY A
WEEK
HE HAS JUST COME HOME AT DAWN AND GONE UP STAIRS TO HIS CHAMBER
LOCKING HIMSELF IN AS IF ANYBODY DREAMT OF COVETING HIS COMPANY THERE
HE HAS CONTINUED PRAYING LIKE A METHODIST ONLY THE DEITY HE IMPLORED IS
SENSELESS DUST AND ASHES AND GOD WHEN ADDRESSED WAS CURIOUSLY
CONFOUNDED WITH HIS OWN BLACK FATHER AFTER CONCLUDING THESE PRECIOUS
ORISONS AND THEY LASTED GENERALLY TILL HE GREW HOARSE AND HIS VOICE WAS
STRANGLED IN HIS THROAT HE WOULD BE OFF AGAIN ALWAYS STRAIGHT DOWN TO
THE GRANGE I WONDER EDGAR DID NOT SEND FOR A CONSTABLE AND GIVE HIM
INTO CUSTODY FOR ME GRIEVED AS I WAS ABOUT CATHERINE IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID REGARDING THIS SEASON OF DELIVERANCE FROM DEGRADING
OPPRESSION AS A HOLIDAY
'I RECOVERED SPIRITS SUFFICIENT TO BEAR JOSEPH'S ETERNAL LECTURES WITHOUT
WEEPING AND TO MOVE UP AND DOWN THE HOUSE LESS WITH THE FOOT OF A
FRIGHTENED THIEF THAN FORMERLY
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT I SHOULD CRY AT
ANYTHING JOSEPH COULD SAY BUT HE AND HARETON ARE DETESTABLE COMPANIONS
I'D RATHER SIT WITH HINDLEY AND HEAR HIS AWFUL TALK THAN WITH T'
LITTLE MAISTER AND HIS STAUNCH SUPPORTER THAT ODIOUS OLD MAN WHEN
HEATHCLIFF IS IN I'M OFTEN OBLIGED TO SEEK THE KITCHEN AND THEIR
SOCIETY OR STARVE AMONG THE DAMP UNINHABITED CHAMBERS WHEN HE IS NOT
AS WAS THE CASE THIS WEEK I ESTABLISH A TABLE AND CHAIR AT ONE CORNER OF
THE HOUSE FIRE AND NEVER MIND HOW MR
EARNSHAW MAY OCCUPY HIMSELF AND
HE DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH MY ARRANGEMENTS
HE IS QUIETER NOW THAN HE
USED TO BE IF NO ONE PROVOKES HIM MORE SULLEN AND DEPRESSED AND LESS
FURIOUS
JOSEPH AFFIRMS HE'S SURE HE'S AN ALTERED MAN THAT THE LORD HAS
TOUCHED HIS HEART AND HE IS SAVED SO AS BY FIRE I'M PUZZLED TO
DETECT SIGNS OF THE FAVOURABLE CHANGE BUT IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS
'YESTER EVENING I SAT IN MY NOOK READING SOME OLD BOOKS TILL LATE ON
TOWARDS TWELVE
IT SEEMED SO DISMAL TO GO UP STAIRS WITH THE WILD SNOW
BLOWING OUTSIDE AND MY THOUGHTS CONTINUALLY REVERTING TO THE KIRK YARD
AND THE NEW MADE GRAVE I DARED HARDLY LIFT MY EYES FROM THE PAGE BEFORE
ME THAT MELANCHOLY SCENE SO INSTANTLY USURPED ITS PLACE
HINDLEY SAT
OPPOSITE HIS HEAD LEANT ON HIS HAND PERHAPS MEDITATING ON THE SAME
SUBJECT
HE HAD CEASED DRINKING AT A POINT BELOW IRRATIONALITY AND HAD
NEITHER STIRRED NOR SPOKEN DURING TWO OR THREE HOURS
THERE WAS NO SOUND
THROUGH THE HOUSE BUT THE MOANING WIND WHICH SHOOK THE WINDOWS EVERY NOW
AND THEN THE FAINT CRACKLING OF THE COALS AND THE CLICK OF MY SNUFFERS
AS I REMOVED AT INTERVALS THE LONG WICK OF THE CANDLE
HARETON AND
JOSEPH WERE PROBABLY FAST ASLEEP IN BED
IT WAS VERY VERY SAD AND
WHILE I READ I SIGHED FOR IT SEEMED AS IF ALL JOY HAD VANISHED FROM THE
WORLD NEVER TO BE RESTORED
'THE DOLEFUL SILENCE WAS BROKEN AT LENGTH BY THE SOUND OF THE KITCHEN
LATCH HEATHCLIFF HAD RETURNED FROM HIS WATCH EARLIER THAN USUAL OWING
I SUPPOSE TO THE SUDDEN STORM
THAT ENTRANCE WAS FASTENED AND WE HEARD
HIM COMING ROUND TO GET IN BY THE OTHER
I ROSE WITH AN IRREPRESSIBLE
EXPRESSION OF WHAT I FELT ON MY LIPS WHICH INDUCED MY COMPANION WHO HAD
BEEN STARING TOWARDS THE DOOR TO TURN AND LOOK AT ME
I'LL KEEP HIM OUT FIVE MINUTES HE EXCLAIMED
YOU WON'T OBJECT
NO YOU MAY KEEP HIM OUT THE WHOLE NIGHT FOR ME I ANSWERED
DO PUT
THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND DRAW THE BOLTS
'EARNSHAW ACCOMPLISHED THIS ERE HIS GUEST REACHED THE FRONT HE THEN CAME
AND BROUGHT HIS CHAIR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF MY TABLE LEANING OVER IT AND
SEARCHING IN MY EYES FOR A SYMPATHY WITH THE BURNING HATE THAT GLEAMED
FROM HIS AS HE BOTH LOOKED AND FELT LIKE AN ASSASSIN HE COULDN'T
EXACTLY FIND THAT BUT HE DISCOVERED ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO SPEAK
YOU AND I HE SAID HAVE EACH A GREAT DEBT TO SETTLE WITH THE MAN
OUT YONDER IF WE WERE NEITHER OF US COWARDS WE MIGHT COMBINE TO
DISCHARGE IT
ARE YOU AS SOFT AS YOUR BROTHER ARE YOU WILLING TO
ENDURE TO THE LAST AND NOT ONCE ATTEMPT A REPAYMENT
I'M WEARY OF ENDURING NOW I REPLIED AND I'D BE GLAD OF A
RETALIATION THAT WOULDN'T RECOIL ON MYSELF BUT TREACHERY AND VIOLENCE
ARE SPEARS POINTED AT BOTH ENDS THEY WOUND THOSE WHO RESORT TO THEM
WORSE THAN THEIR ENEMIES
TREACHERY AND VIOLENCE ARE A JUST RETURN FOR TREACHERY AND VIOLENCE
CRIED HINDLEY
MRS
HEATHCLIFF I'LL ASK YOU TO DO NOTHING BUT SIT
STILL AND BE DUMB
TELL ME NOW CAN YOU I'M SURE YOU WOULD HAVE AS
MUCH PLEASURE AS I IN WITNESSING THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIEND'S EXISTENCE
HE'LL BE YOUR DEATH UNLESS YOU OVERREACH HIM AND HE'LL BE MY RUIN
DAMN THE HELLISH VILLAIN HE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR AS IF HE WERE MASTER
HERE ALREADY PROMISE TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND BEFORE THAT CLOCK
STRIKES IT WANTS THREE MINUTES OF ONE YOU'RE A FREE WOMAN
'HE TOOK THE IMPLEMENTS WHICH I DESCRIBED TO YOU IN MY LETTER FROM HIS
BREAST AND WOULD HAVE TURNED DOWN THE CANDLE
I SNATCHED IT AWAY
HOWEVER AND SEIZED HIS ARM
I'LL NOT HOLD MY TONGUE I SAID YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH HIM
LET THE DOOR
REMAIN SHUT AND BE QUIET
NO I'VE FORMED MY RESOLUTION AND BY GOD I'LL EXECUTE IT CRIED THE
DESPERATE BEING
I'LL DO YOU A KINDNESS IN SPITE OF YOURSELF AND
HARETON JUSTICE AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOUR HEAD TO SCREEN ME
CATHERINE IS GONE
NOBODY ALIVE WOULD REGRET ME OR BE ASHAMED THOUGH I
CUT MY THROAT THIS MINUTE AND IT'S TIME TO MAKE AN END
'I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE STRUGGLED WITH A BEAR OR REASONED WITH A LUNATIC
THE ONLY RESOURCE LEFT ME WAS TO RUN TO A LATTICE AND WARN HIS INTENDED
VICTIM OF THE FATE WHICH AWAITED HIM
YOU'D BETTER SEEK SHELTER SOMEWHERE ELSE TO NIGHT I EXCLAIMED IN
RATHER A TRIUMPHANT TONE
MR
EARNSHAW HAS A MIND TO SHOOT YOU IF YOU
PERSIST IN ENDEAVOURING TO ENTER
YOU'D BETTER OPEN THE DOOR YOU HE ANSWERED ADDRESSING ME BY SOME
ELEGANT TERM THAT I DON'T CARE TO REPEAT
I SHALL NOT MEDDLE IN THE MATTER I RETORTED AGAIN
COME IN AND GET
SHOT IF YOU PLEASE
I'VE DONE MY DUTY
'WITH THAT I SHUT THE WINDOW AND RETURNED TO MY PLACE BY THE FIRE HAVING
TOO SMALL A STOCK OF HYPOCRISY AT MY COMMAND TO PRETEND ANY ANXIETY FOR
THE DANGER THAT MENACED HIM
EARNSHAW SWORE PASSIONATELY AT ME
AFFIRMING THAT I LOVED THE VILLAIN YET AND CALLING ME ALL SORTS OF NAMES
FOR THE BASE SPIRIT I EVINCED
AND I IN MY SECRET HEART AND CONSCIENCE
NEVER REPROACHED ME THOUGHT WHAT A BLESSING IT WOULD BE FOR HIM
SHOULD HEATHCLIFF PUT HIM OUT OF MISERY AND WHAT A BLESSING FOR ME
SHOULD HE SEND HEATHCLIFF TO HIS RIGHT ABODE AS I SAT NURSING THESE
REFLECTIONS THE CASEMENT BEHIND ME WAS BANGED ON TO THE FLOOR BY A BLOW
FROM THE LATTER INDIVIDUAL AND HIS BLACK COUNTENANCE LOOKED BLIGHTINGLY
THROUGH
THE STANCHIONS STOOD TOO CLOSE TO SUFFER HIS SHOULDERS TO
FOLLOW AND I SMILED EXULTING IN MY FANCIED SECURITY
HIS HAIR AND
CLOTHES WERE WHITENED WITH SNOW AND HIS SHARP CANNIBAL TEETH REVEALED
BY COLD AND WRATH GLEAMED THROUGH THE DARK
ISABELLA LET ME IN OR I'LL MAKE YOU REPENT HE GIRNED AS JOSEPH
CALLS IT
I CANNOT COMMIT MURDER I REPLIED
MR
HINDLEY STANDS SENTINEL WITH
A KNIFE AND LOADED PISTOL
LET ME IN BY THE KITCHEN DOOR HE SAID
HINDLEY WILL BE THERE BEFORE ME I ANSWERED AND THAT'S A POOR LOVE
OF YOURS THAT CANNOT BEAR A SHOWER OF SNOW WE WERE LEFT AT PEACE IN OUR
BEDS AS LONG AS THE SUMMER MOON SHONE BUT THE MOMENT A BLAST OF WINTER
RETURNS YOU MUST RUN FOR SHELTER HEATHCLIFF IF I WERE YOU I'D GO
STRETCH MYSELF OVER HER GRAVE AND DIE LIKE A FAITHFUL DOG
THE WORLD IS
SURELY NOT WORTH LIVING IN NOW IS IT YOU HAD DISTINCTLY IMPRESSED ON
ME THE IDEA THAT CATHERINE WAS THE WHOLE JOY OF YOUR LIFE I CAN'T
IMAGINE HOW YOU THINK OF SURVIVING HER LOSS
HE'S THERE IS HE EXCLAIMED MY COMPANION RUSHING TO THE GAP
IF I
CAN GET MY ARM OUT I CAN HIT HIM
'I'M AFRAID ELLEN YOU'LL SET ME DOWN AS REALLY WICKED BUT YOU DON'T
KNOW ALL SO DON'T JUDGE
I WOULDN'T HAVE AIDED OR ABETTED AN ATTEMPT ON
EVEN HIS LIFE FOR ANYTHING
WISH THAT HE WERE DEAD I MUST AND
THEREFORE I WAS FEARFULLY DISAPPOINTED AND UNNERVED BY TERROR FOR THE
CONSEQUENCES OF MY TAUNTING SPEECH WHEN HE FLUNG HIMSELF ON EARNSHAW'S
WEAPON AND WRENCHED IT FROM HIS GRASP
'THE CHARGE EXPLODED AND THE KNIFE IN SPRINGING BACK CLOSED INTO ITS
OWNER'S WRIST
HEATHCLIFF PULLED IT AWAY BY MAIN FORCE SLITTING UP THE
FLESH AS IT PASSED ON AND THRUST IT DRIPPING INTO HIS POCKET
HE THEN
TOOK A STONE STRUCK DOWN THE DIVISION BETWEEN TWO WINDOWS AND SPRANG
IN
HIS ADVERSARY HAD FALLEN SENSELESS WITH EXCESSIVE PAIN AND THE FLOW
OF BLOOD THAT GUSHED FROM AN ARTERY OR A LARGE VEIN
THE RUFFIAN KICKED
AND TRAMPLED ON HIM AND DASHED HIS HEAD REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE FLAGS
HOLDING ME WITH ONE HAND MEANTIME TO PREVENT ME SUMMONING JOSEPH
HE
EXERTED PRETERHUMAN SELF DENIAL IN ABSTAINING FROM FINISHING HIM
COMPLETELY BUT GETTING OUT OF BREATH HE FINALLY DESISTED AND DRAGGED
THE APPARENTLY INANIMATE BODY ON TO THE SETTLE
THERE HE TORE OFF THE
SLEEVE OF EARNSHAW'S COAT AND BOUND UP THE WOUND WITH BRUTAL ROUGHNESS
SPITTING AND CURSING DURING THE OPERATION AS ENERGETICALLY AS HE HAD
KICKED BEFORE
BEING AT LIBERTY I LOST NO TIME IN SEEKING THE OLD
SERVANT WHO HAVING GATHERED BY DEGREES THE PURPORT OF MY HASTY TALE
HURRIED BELOW GASPING AS HE DESCENDED THE STEPS TWO AT ONCE
WHAT IS THER TO DO NOW WHAT IS THER TO DO NOW
THERE'S THIS TO DO THUNDERED HEATHCLIFF THAT YOUR MASTER'S MAD AND
SHOULD HE LAST ANOTHER MONTH I'LL HAVE HIM TO AN ASYLUM
AND HOW THE
DEVIL DID YOU COME TO FASTEN ME OUT YOU TOOTHLESS HOUND DON'T STAND
MUTTERING AND MUMBLING THERE
COME I'M NOT GOING TO NURSE HIM
WASH
THAT STUFF AWAY AND MIND THE SPARKS OF YOUR CANDLE IT IS MORE THAN HALF
BRANDY
AND SO YE'VE BEEN MURTHERING ON HIM EXCLAIMED JOSEPH LIFTING HIS
HANDS AND EYES IN HORROR
IF IVER I SEED A SEEGHT LOIKE THIS MAY THE
LORD
'HEATHCLIFF GAVE HIM A PUSH ON TO HIS KNEES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLOOD
AND FLUNG A TOWEL TO HIM BUT INSTEAD OF PROCEEDING TO DRY IT UP HE
JOINED HIS HANDS AND BEGAN A PRAYER WHICH EXCITED MY LAUGHTER FROM ITS
ODD PHRASEOLOGY
I WAS IN THE CONDITION OF MIND TO BE SHOCKED AT
NOTHING IN FACT I WAS AS RECKLESS AS SOME MALEFACTORS SHOW THEMSELVES
AT THE FOOT OF THE GALLOWS
OH I FORGOT YOU SAID THE TYRANT
YOU SHALL DO THAT
DOWN WITH
YOU
AND YOU CONSPIRE WITH HIM AGAINST ME DO YOU VIPER THERE THAT
IS WORK FIT FOR YOU
'HE SHOOK ME TILL MY TEETH RATTLED AND PITCHED ME BESIDE JOSEPH WHO
STEADILY CONCLUDED HIS SUPPLICATIONS AND THEN ROSE VOWING HE WOULD SET
OFF FOR THE GRANGE DIRECTLY
MR
LINTON WAS A MAGISTRATE AND THOUGH HE
HAD FIFTY WIVES DEAD HE SHOULD INQUIRE INTO THIS
HE WAS SO OBSTINATE
IN HIS RESOLUTION THAT HEATHCLIFF DEEMED IT EXPEDIENT TO COMPEL FROM MY
LIPS A RECAPITULATION OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE STANDING OVER ME HEAVING
WITH MALEVOLENCE AS I RELUCTANTLY DELIVERED THE ACCOUNT IN ANSWER TO HIS
QUESTIONS
IT REQUIRED A GREAT DEAL OF LABOUR TO SATISFY THE OLD MAN
THAT HEATHCLIFF WAS NOT THE AGGRESSOR ESPECIALLY WITH MY HARDLY WRUNG
REPLIES
HOWEVER MR
EARNSHAW SOON CONVINCED HIM THAT HE WAS ALIVE
STILL JOSEPH HASTENED TO ADMINISTER A DOSE OF SPIRITS AND BY THEIR
SUCCOUR HIS MASTER PRESENTLY REGAINED MOTION AND CONSCIOUSNESS
HEATHCLIFF AWARE THAT HIS OPPONENT WAS IGNORANT OF THE TREATMENT
RECEIVED WHILE INSENSIBLE CALLED HIM DELIRIOUSLY INTOXICATED AND SAID
HE SHOULD NOT NOTICE HIS ATROCIOUS CONDUCT FURTHER BUT ADVISED HIM TO
GET TO BED
TO MY JOY HE LEFT US AFTER GIVING THIS JUDICIOUS COUNSEL
AND HINDLEY STRETCHED HIMSELF ON THE HEARTHSTONE
I DEPARTED TO MY OWN
ROOM MARVELLING THAT I HAD ESCAPED SO EASILY
'THIS MORNING WHEN I CAME DOWN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE NOON MR
EARNSHAW WAS SITTING BY THE FIRE DEADLY SICK HIS EVIL GENIUS ALMOST AS
GAUNT AND GHASTLY LEANT AGAINST THE CHIMNEY
NEITHER APPEARED INCLINED
TO DINE AND HAVING WAITED TILL ALL WAS COLD ON THE TABLE I COMMENCED
ALONE
NOTHING HINDERED ME FROM EATING HEARTILY AND I EXPERIENCED A
CERTAIN SENSE OF SATISFACTION AND SUPERIORITY AS AT INTERVALS I CAST A
LOOK TOWARDS MY SILENT COMPANIONS AND FELT THE COMFORT OF A QUIET
CONSCIENCE WITHIN ME
AFTER I HAD DONE I VENTURED ON THE UNUSUAL
LIBERTY OF DRAWING NEAR THE FIRE GOING ROUND EARNSHAW'S SEAT AND
KNEELING IN THE CORNER BESIDE HIM
'HEATHCLIFF DID NOT GLANCE MY WAY AND I GAZED UP AND CONTEMPLATED HIS
FEATURES ALMOST AS CONFIDENTLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN TURNED TO STONE
HIS
FOREHEAD THAT I ONCE THOUGHT SO MANLY AND THAT I NOW THINK SO
DIABOLICAL WAS SHADED WITH A HEAVY CLOUD HIS BASILISK EYES WERE NEARLY
QUENCHED BY SLEEPLESSNESS AND WEEPING PERHAPS FOR THE LASHES WERE WET
THEN HIS LIPS DEVOID OF THEIR FEROCIOUS SNEER AND SEALED IN AN
EXPRESSION OF UNSPEAKABLE SADNESS
HAD IT BEEN ANOTHER I WOULD HAVE
COVERED MY FACE IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH GRIEF
IN HIS CASE I WAS
GRATIFIED AND IGNOBLE AS IT SEEMS TO INSULT A FALLEN ENEMY I COULDN'T
MISS THIS CHANCE OF STICKING IN A DART HIS WEAKNESS WAS THE ONLY TIME
WHEN I COULD TASTE THE DELIGHT OF PAYING WRONG FOR WRONG
'FIE FIE MISS I INTERRUPTED
'ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE YOU HAD NEVER OPENED
A BIBLE IN YOUR LIFE
IF GOD AFFLICT YOUR ENEMIES SURELY THAT OUGHT TO
SUFFICE YOU
IT IS BOTH MEAN AND PRESUMPTUOUS TO ADD YOUR TORTURE TO
HIS
'IN GENERAL I'LL ALLOW THAT IT WOULD BE ELLEN SHE CONTINUED 'BUT WHAT
MISERY LAID ON HEATHCLIFF COULD CONTENT ME UNLESS I HAVE A HAND IN IT
I'D RATHER HE SUFFERED LESS IF I MIGHT CAUSE HIS SUFFERINGS AND HE MIGHT
KNOW THAT I WAS THE CAUSE
OH I OWE HIM SO MUCH
ON ONLY ONE
CONDITION CAN I HOPE TO FORGIVE HIM
IT IS IF I MAY TAKE AN EYE FOR AN
EYE A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH FOR EVERY WRENCH OF AGONY RETURN A WRENCH
REDUCE HIM TO MY LEVEL
AS HE WAS THE FIRST TO INJURE MAKE HIM THE
FIRST TO IMPLORE PARDON AND THEN WHY THEN ELLEN I MIGHT SHOW YOU SOME
GENEROSITY
BUT IT IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE I CAN EVER BE REVENGED AND
THEREFORE I CANNOT FORGIVE HIM
HINDLEY WANTED SOME WATER AND I HANDED
HIM A GLASS AND ASKED HIM HOW HE WAS
NOT AS ILL AS I WISH HE REPLIED
BUT LEAVING OUT MY ARM EVERY INCH
OF ME IS AS SORE AS IF I HAD BEEN FIGHTING WITH A LEGION OF IMPS
YES NO WONDER WAS MY NEXT REMARK
CATHERINE USED TO BOAST THAT SHE
STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND BODILY HARM SHE MEANT THAT CERTAIN PERSONS WOULD
NOT HURT YOU FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING HER
IT'S WELL PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
RISE FROM THEIR GRAVE OR LAST NIGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE WITNESSED A
REPULSIVE SCENE ARE NOT YOU BRUISED AND CUT OVER YOUR CHEST AND
SHOULDERS
I CAN'T SAY HE ANSWERED BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN DID HE DARE TO
STRIKE ME WHEN I WAS DOWN
HE TRAMPLED ON AND KICKED YOU AND DASHED YOU ON THE GROUND I
WHISPERED
AND HIS MOUTH WATERED TO TEAR YOU WITH HIS TEETH BECAUSE
HE'S ONLY HALF MAN NOT SO MUCH AND THE REST FIEND
'MR
EARNSHAW LOOKED UP LIKE ME TO THE COUNTENANCE OF OUR MUTUAL FOE
WHO ABSORBED IN HIS ANGUISH SEEMED INSENSIBLE TO ANYTHING AROUND HIM
THE LONGER HE STOOD THE PLAINER HIS REFLECTIONS REVEALED THEIR BLACKNESS
THROUGH HIS FEATURES
OH IF GOD WOULD BUT GIVE ME STRENGTH TO STRANGLE HIM IN MY LAST AGONY
I'D GO TO HELL WITH JOY GROANED THE IMPATIENT MAN WRITHING TO RISE
AND SINKING BACK IN DESPAIR CONVINCED OF HIS INADEQUACY FOR THE
STRUGGLE
NAY IT'S ENOUGH THAT HE HAS MURDERED ONE OF YOU I OBSERVED ALOUD
AT THE GRANGE EVERY ONE KNOWS YOUR SISTER WOULD HAVE BEEN LIVING NOW
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR MR
HEATHCLIFF
AFTER ALL IT IS PREFERABLE TO BE
HATED THAN LOVED BY HIM
WHEN I RECOLLECT HOW HAPPY WE WERE HOW HAPPY
CATHERINE WAS BEFORE HE CAME I'M FIT TO CURSE THE DAY
'MOST LIKELY HEATHCLIFF NOTICED MORE THE TRUTH OF WHAT WAS SAID THAN
THE SPIRIT OF THE PERSON WHO SAID IT
HIS ATTENTION WAS ROUSED I SAW
FOR HIS EYES RAINED DOWN TEARS AMONG THE ASHES AND HE DREW HIS BREATH IN
SUFFOCATING SIGHS
I STARED FULL AT HIM AND LAUGHED SCORNFULLY
THE
CLOUDED WINDOWS OF HELL FLASHED A MOMENT TOWARDS ME THE FIEND WHICH
USUALLY LOOKED OUT HOWEVER WAS SO DIMMED AND DROWNED THAT I DID NOT
FEAR TO HAZARD ANOTHER SOUND OF DERISION
GET UP AND BEGONE OUT OF MY SIGHT SAID THE MOURNER
'I GUESSED HE UTTERED THOSE WORDS AT LEAST THOUGH HIS VOICE WAS HARDLY
INTELLIGIBLE
I BEG YOUR PARDON I REPLIED
BUT I LOVED CATHERINE TOO AND HER
BROTHER REQUIRES ATTENDANCE WHICH FOR HER SAKE I SHALL SUPPLY
NOW
THAT SHE'S DEAD I SEE HER IN HINDLEY HINDLEY HAS EXACTLY HER EYES IF
YOU HAD NOT TRIED TO GOUGE THEM OUT AND MADE THEM BLACK AND RED AND
HER
GET UP WRETCHED IDIOT BEFORE I STAMP YOU TO DEATH HE CRIED MAKING
A MOVEMENT THAT CAUSED ME TO MAKE ONE ALSO
BUT THEN I CONTINUED HOLDING MYSELF READY TO FLEE IF POOR
CATHERINE HAD TRUSTED YOU AND ASSUMED THE RIDICULOUS CONTEMPTIBLE
DEGRADING TITLE OF MRS
HEATHCLIFF SHE WOULD SOON HAVE PRESENTED A
SIMILAR PICTURE SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BORNE YOUR ABOMINABLE BEHAVIOUR
QUIETLY HER DETESTATION AND DISGUST MUST HAVE FOUND VOICE
'THE BACK OF THE SETTLE AND EARNSHAW'S PERSON INTERPOSED BETWEEN ME AND
HIM SO INSTEAD OF ENDEAVOURING TO REACH ME HE SNATCHED A DINNER KNIFE
FROM THE TABLE AND FLUNG IT AT MY HEAD
IT STRUCK BENEATH MY EAR AND
STOPPED THE SENTENCE I WAS UTTERING BUT PULLING IT OUT I SPRANG TO THE
DOOR AND DELIVERED ANOTHER WHICH I HOPE WENT A LITTLE DEEPER THAN HIS
MISSILE
THE LAST GLIMPSE I CAUGHT OF HIM WAS A FURIOUS RUSH ON HIS
PART CHECKED BY THE EMBRACE OF HIS HOST AND BOTH FELL LOCKED TOGETHER
ON THE HEARTH
IN MY FLIGHT THROUGH THE KITCHEN I BID JOSEPH SPEED TO
HIS MASTER I KNOCKED OVER HARETON WHO WAS HANGING A LITTER OF PUPPIES
FROM A CHAIR BACK IN THE DOORWAY AND BLESSED AS A SOUL ESCAPED FROM
PURGATORY I BOUNDED LEAPED AND FLEW DOWN THE STEEP ROAD THEN
QUITTING ITS WINDINGS SHOT DIRECT ACROSS THE MOOR ROLLING OVER BANKS
AND WADING THROUGH MARSHES PRECIPITATING MYSELF IN FACT TOWARDS THE
BEACON LIGHT OF THE GRANGE
AND FAR RATHER WOULD I BE CONDEMNED TO A
PERPETUAL DWELLING IN THE INFERNAL REGIONS THAN EVEN FOR ONE NIGHT
ABIDE BENEATH THE ROOF OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS AGAIN
ISABELLA CEASED SPEAKING AND TOOK A DRINK OF TEA THEN SHE ROSE AND
BIDDING ME PUT ON HER BONNET AND A GREAT SHAWL I HAD BROUGHT AND
TURNING A DEAF EAR TO MY ENTREATIES FOR HER TO REMAIN ANOTHER HOUR SHE
STEPPED ON TO A CHAIR KISSED EDGAR'S AND CATHERINE'S PORTRAITS BESTOWED
A SIMILAR SALUTE ON ME AND DESCENDED TO THE CARRIAGE ACCOMPANIED BY
FANNY WHO YELPED WILD WITH JOY AT RECOVERING HER MISTRESS
SHE WAS
DRIVEN AWAY NEVER TO REVISIT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD BUT A REGULAR
CORRESPONDENCE WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN HER AND MY MASTER WHEN THINGS WERE
MORE SETTLED
I BELIEVE HER NEW ABODE WAS IN THE SOUTH NEAR LONDON
THERE SHE HAD A SON BORN A FEW MONTHS SUBSEQUENT TO HER ESCAPE
HE WAS
CHRISTENED LINTON AND FROM THE FIRST SHE REPORTED HIM TO BE AN AILING
PEEVISH CREATURE
MR
HEATHCLIFF MEETING ME ONE DAY IN THE VILLAGE INQUIRED WHERE SHE
LIVED
I REFUSED TO TELL
HE REMARKED THAT IT WAS NOT OF ANY MOMENT
ONLY SHE MUST BEWARE OF COMING TO HER BROTHER SHE SHOULD NOT BE WITH
HIM IF HE HAD TO KEEP HER HIMSELF
THOUGH I WOULD GIVE NO INFORMATION
HE DISCOVERED THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER SERVANTS BOTH HER PLACE OF
RESIDENCE AND THE EXISTENCE OF THE CHILD
STILL HE DIDN'T MOLEST HER
FOR WHICH FORBEARANCE SHE MIGHT THANK HIS AVERSION I SUPPOSE
HE OFTEN
ASKED ABOUT THE INFANT WHEN HE SAW ME AND ON HEARING ITS NAME SMILED
GRIMLY AND OBSERVED 'THEY WISH ME TO HATE IT TOO DO THEY
'I DON'T THINK THEY WISH YOU TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT I ANSWERED
'BUT I'LL HAVE IT HE SAID 'WHEN I WANT IT
THEY MAY RECKON ON THAT
FORTUNATELY ITS MOTHER DIED BEFORE THE TIME ARRIVED SOME THIRTEEN YEARS
AFTER THE DECEASE OF CATHERINE WHEN LINTON WAS TWELVE OR A LITTLE MORE
ON THE DAY SUCCEEDING ISABELLA'S UNEXPECTED VISIT I HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF
SPEAKING TO MY MASTER HE SHUNNED CONVERSATION AND WAS FIT FOR
DISCUSSING NOTHING
WHEN I COULD GET HIM TO LISTEN I SAW IT PLEASED HIM
THAT HIS SISTER HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND WHOM HE ABHORRED WITH AN INTENSITY
WHICH THE MILDNESS OF HIS NATURE WOULD SCARCELY SEEM TO ALLOW
SO DEEP
AND SENSITIVE WAS HIS AVERSION THAT HE REFRAINED FROM GOING ANYWHERE
WHERE HE WAS LIKELY TO SEE OR HEAR OF HEATHCLIFF
GRIEF AND THAT
TOGETHER TRANSFORMED HIM INTO A COMPLETE HERMIT HE THREW UP HIS OFFICE
OF MAGISTRATE CEASED EVEN TO ATTEND CHURCH AVOIDED THE VILLAGE ON ALL
OCCASIONS AND SPENT A LIFE OF ENTIRE SECLUSION WITHIN THE LIMITS OF HIS
PARK AND GROUNDS ONLY VARIED BY SOLITARY RAMBLES ON THE MOORS AND
VISITS TO THE GRAVE OF HIS WIFE MOSTLY AT EVENING OR EARLY MORNING
BEFORE OTHER WANDERERS WERE ABROAD
BUT HE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE THOROUGHLY
UNHAPPY LONG
HE DIDN'T PRAY FOR CATHERINE'S SOUL TO HAUNT HIM
TIME
BROUGHT RESIGNATION AND A MELANCHOLY SWEETER THAN COMMON JOY
HE
RECALLED HER MEMORY WITH ARDENT TENDER LOVE AND HOPEFUL ASPIRING TO THE
BETTER WORLD WHERE HE DOUBTED NOT SHE WAS GONE
AND HE HAD EARTHLY CONSOLATION AND AFFECTIONS ALSO
FOR A FEW DAYS I
SAID HE SEEMED REGARDLESS OF THE PUNY SUCCESSOR TO THE DEPARTED THAT
COLDNESS MELTED AS FAST AS SNOW IN APRIL AND ERE THE TINY THING COULD
STAMMER A WORD OR TOTTER A STEP IT WIELDED A DESPOT'S SCEPTRE IN HIS
HEART
IT WAS NAMED CATHERINE BUT HE NEVER CALLED IT THE NAME IN FULL
AS HE HAD NEVER CALLED THE FIRST CATHERINE SHORT PROBABLY BECAUSE
HEATHCLIFF HAD A HABIT OF DOING SO
THE LITTLE ONE WAS ALWAYS CATHY IT
FORMED TO HIM A DISTINCTION FROM THE MOTHER AND YET A CONNECTION WITH
HER AND HIS ATTACHMENT SPRANG FROM ITS RELATION TO HER FAR MORE THAN
FROM ITS BEING HIS OWN
I USED TO DRAW A COMPARISON BETWEEN HIM AND HINDLEY EARNSHAW AND PERPLEX
MYSELF TO EXPLAIN SATISFACTORILY WHY THEIR CONDUCT WAS SO OPPOSITE IN
SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
THEY HAD BOTH BEEN FOND HUSBANDS AND WERE BOTH
ATTACHED TO THEIR CHILDREN AND I COULD NOT SEE HOW THEY SHOULDN'T BOTH
HAVE TAKEN THE SAME ROAD FOR GOOD OR EVIL
BUT I THOUGHT IN MY MIND
HINDLEY WITH APPARENTLY THE STRONGER HEAD HAS SHOWN HIMSELF SADLY THE
WORSE AND THE WEAKER MAN
WHEN HIS SHIP STRUCK THE CAPTAIN ABANDONED
HIS POST AND THE CREW INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SAVE HER RUSHED INTO RIOT
AND CONFUSION LEAVING NO HOPE FOR THEIR LUCKLESS VESSEL
LINTON ON THE
CONTRARY DISPLAYED THE TRUE COURAGE OF A LOYAL AND FAITHFUL SOUL HE
TRUSTED GOD AND GOD COMFORTED HIM
ONE HOPED AND THE OTHER DESPAIRED
THEY CHOSE THEIR OWN LOTS AND WERE RIGHTEOUSLY DOOMED TO ENDURE THEM
BUT YOU'LL NOT WANT TO HEAR MY MORALISING MR
LOCKWOOD YOU'LL JUDGE AS
WELL AS I CAN ALL THESE THINGS AT LEAST YOU'LL THINK YOU WILL AND
THAT'S THE SAME
THE END OF EARNSHAW WAS WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED
IT FOLLOWED FAST ON HIS SISTER'S THERE WERE SCARCELY SIX MONTHS BETWEEN
THEM
WE AT THE GRANGE NEVER GOT A VERY SUCCINCT ACCOUNT OF HIS STATE
PRECEDING IT ALL THAT I DID LEARN WAS ON OCCASION OF GOING TO AID IN THE
PREPARATIONS FOR THE FUNERAL
MR
KENNETH CAME TO ANNOUNCE THE EVENT TO
MY MASTER
'WELL NELLY SAID HE RIDING INTO THE YARD ONE MORNING TOO EARLY NOT
TO ALARM ME WITH AN INSTANT PRESENTIMENT OF BAD NEWS 'IT'S YOURS AND MY
TURN TO GO INTO MOURNING AT PRESENT
WHO'S GIVEN US THE SLIP NOW DO YOU
THINK
'WHO I ASKED IN A FLURRY
'WHY GUESS HE RETURNED DISMOUNTING AND SLINGING HIS BRIDLE ON A HOOK
BY THE DOOR
'AND NIP UP THE CORNER OF YOUR APRON I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL
NEED IT
'NOT MR
HEATHCLIFF SURELY I EXCLAIMED
'WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TEARS FOR HIM SAID THE DOCTOR
'NO HEATHCLIFF'S
A TOUGH YOUNG FELLOW HE LOOKS BLOOMING TO DAY
I'VE JUST SEEN HIM
HE'S
RAPIDLY REGAINING FLESH SINCE HE LOST HIS BETTER HALF
'WHO IS IT THEN MR
KENNETH I REPEATED IMPATIENTLY
'HINDLEY EARNSHAW YOUR OLD FRIEND HINDLEY HE REPLIED 'AND MY WICKED
GOSSIP THOUGH HE'S BEEN TOO WILD FOR ME THIS LONG WHILE
THERE I SAID
WE SHOULD DRAW WATER
BUT CHEER UP HE DIED TRUE TO HIS CHARACTER
DRUNK AS A LORD
POOR LAD I'M SORRY TOO
ONE CAN'T HELP MISSING AN
OLD COMPANION THOUGH HE HAD THE WORST TRICKS WITH HIM THAT EVER MAN
IMAGINED AND HAS DONE ME MANY A RASCALLY TURN
HE'S BARELY
TWENTY SEVEN IT SEEMS THAT'S YOUR OWN AGE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU
WERE BORN IN ONE YEAR
I CONFESS THIS BLOW WAS GREATER TO ME THAN THE SHOCK OF MRS
LINTON'S
DEATH ANCIENT ASSOCIATIONS LINGERED ROUND MY HEART I SAT DOWN IN THE
PORCH AND WEPT AS FOR A BLOOD RELATION DESIRING MR
KENNETH TO GET
ANOTHER SERVANT TO INTRODUCE HIM TO THE MASTER
I COULD NOT HINDER
MYSELF FROM PONDERING ON THE QUESTION 'HAD HE HAD FAIR PLAY WHATEVER
I DID THAT IDEA WOULD BOTHER ME IT WAS SO TIRESOMELY PERTINACIOUS THAT
I RESOLVED ON REQUESTING LEAVE TO GO TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND ASSIST IN
THE LAST DUTIES TO THE DEAD
MR
LINTON WAS EXTREMELY RELUCTANT TO
CONSENT BUT I PLEADED ELOQUENTLY FOR THE FRIENDLESS CONDITION IN WHICH
HE LAY AND I SAID MY OLD MASTER AND FOSTER BROTHER HAD A CLAIM ON MY
SERVICES AS STRONG AS HIS OWN
BESIDES I REMINDED HIM THAT THE CHILD
HARETON WAS HIS WIFE'S NEPHEW AND IN THE ABSENCE OF NEARER KIN HE
OUGHT TO ACT AS ITS GUARDIAN AND HE OUGHT TO AND MUST INQUIRE HOW THE
PROPERTY WAS LEFT AND LOOK OVER THE CONCERNS OF HIS BROTHER IN LAW
HE
WAS UNFIT FOR ATTENDING TO SUCH MATTERS THEN BUT HE BID ME SPEAK TO HIS
LAWYER AND AT LENGTH PERMITTED ME TO GO
HIS LAWYER HAD BEEN EARNSHAW'S
ALSO I CALLED AT THE VILLAGE AND ASKED HIM TO ACCOMPANY ME
HE SHOOK
HIS HEAD AND ADVISED THAT HEATHCLIFF SHOULD BE LET ALONE AFFIRMING IF
THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN HARETON WOULD BE FOUND LITTLE ELSE THAN A BEGGAR
'HIS FATHER DIED IN DEBT HE SAID 'THE WHOLE PROPERTY IS MORTGAGED AND
THE SOLE CHANCE FOR THE NATURAL HEIR IS TO ALLOW HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF
CREATING SOME INTEREST IN THE CREDITOR'S HEART THAT HE MAY BE INCLINED
TO DEAL LENIENTLY TOWARDS HIM
WHEN I REACHED THE HEIGHTS I EXPLAINED THAT I HAD COME TO SEE EVERYTHING
CARRIED ON DECENTLY AND JOSEPH WHO APPEARED IN SUFFICIENT DISTRESS
EXPRESSED SATISFACTION AT MY PRESENCE
MR
HEATHCLIFF SAID HE DID NOT
PERCEIVE THAT I WAS WANTED BUT I MIGHT STAY AND ORDER THE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR THE FUNERAL IF I CHOSE
'CORRECTLY HE REMARKED 'THAT FOOL'S BODY SHOULD BE BURIED AT THE
CROSS ROADS WITHOUT CEREMONY OF ANY KIND
I HAPPENED TO LEAVE HIM TEN
MINUTES YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND IN THAT INTERVAL HE FASTENED THE TWO
DOORS OF THE HOUSE AGAINST ME AND HE HAS SPENT THE NIGHT IN DRINKING
HIMSELF TO DEATH DELIBERATELY WE BROKE IN THIS MORNING FOR WE HEARD
HIM SPORTING LIKE A HORSE AND THERE HE WAS LAID OVER THE SETTLE
FLAYING AND SCALPING WOULD NOT HAVE WAKENED HIM
I SENT FOR KENNETH AND
HE CAME BUT NOT TILL THE BEAST HAD CHANGED INTO CARRION HE WAS BOTH
DEAD AND COLD AND STARK AND SO YOU'LL ALLOW IT WAS USELESS MAKING MORE
STIR ABOUT HIM
THE OLD SERVANT CONFIRMED THIS STATEMENT BUT MUTTERED
'I'D RAYTHER HE'D GOAN HISSELN FOR T' DOCTOR I SUD HA' TAEN TENT O' T'
MAISTER BETTER NOR HIM AND HE WARN'T DEEAD WHEN I LEFT NAUGHT O' T'
SOART
I INSISTED ON THE FUNERAL BEING RESPECTABLE
MR
HEATHCLIFF SAID I MIGHT
HAVE MY OWN WAY THERE TOO ONLY HE DESIRED ME TO REMEMBER THAT THE MONEY
FOR THE WHOLE AFFAIR CAME OUT OF HIS POCKET
HE MAINTAINED A HARD
CARELESS DEPORTMENT INDICATIVE OF NEITHER JOY NOR SORROW IF ANYTHING
IT EXPRESSED A FLINTY GRATIFICATION AT A PIECE OF DIFFICULT WORK
SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED
I OBSERVED ONCE INDEED SOMETHING LIKE
EXULTATION IN HIS ASPECT IT WAS JUST WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE BEARING THE
COFFIN FROM THE HOUSE
HE HAD THE HYPOCRISY TO REPRESENT A MOURNER AND
PREVIOUS TO FOLLOWING WITH HARETON HE LIFTED THE UNFORTUNATE CHILD ON TO
THE TABLE AND MUTTERED WITH PECULIAR GUSTO 'NOW MY BONNY LAD YOU ARE
MINE AND WE'LL SEE IF ONE TREE WON'T GROW AS CROOKED AS ANOTHER WITH
THE SAME WIND TO TWIST IT THE UNSUSPECTING THING WAS PLEASED AT THIS
SPEECH HE PLAYED WITH HEATHCLIFF'S WHISKERS AND STROKED HIS CHEEK BUT
I DIVINED ITS MEANING AND OBSERVED TARTLY 'THAT BOY MUST GO BACK WITH
ME TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE SIR
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD LESS YOURS
THAN HE IS
'DOES LINTON SAY SO HE DEMANDED
'OF COURSE HE HAS ORDERED ME TO TAKE HIM I REPLIED
'WELL SAID THE SCOUNDREL 'WE'LL NOT ARGUE THE SUBJECT NOW BUT I HAVE
A FANCY TO TRY MY HAND AT REARING A YOUNG ONE SO INTIMATE TO YOUR MASTER
THAT I MUST SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THIS WITH MY OWN IF HE ATTEMPT TO REMOVE
IT
I DON'T ENGAGE TO LET HARETON GO UNDISPUTED BUT I'LL BE PRETTY SURE
TO MAKE THE OTHER COME REMEMBER TO TELL HIM
THIS HINT WAS ENOUGH TO BIND OUR HANDS
I REPEATED ITS SUBSTANCE ON MY
RETURN AND EDGAR LINTON LITTLE INTERESTED AT THE COMMENCEMENT SPOKE NO
MORE OF INTERFERING
I'M NOT AWARE THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE IT TO ANY
PURPOSE HAD HE BEEN EVER SO WILLING
THE GUEST WAS NOW THE MASTER OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS HE HELD FIRM
POSSESSION AND PROVED TO THE ATTORNEY WHO IN HIS TURN PROVED IT TO
MR
LINTON THAT EARNSHAW HAD MORTGAGED EVERY YARD OF LAND HE OWNED FOR
CASH TO SUPPLY HIS MANIA FOR GAMING AND HE HEATHCLIFF WAS THE
MORTGAGEE
IN THAT MANNER HARETON WHO SHOULD NOW BE THE FIRST GENTLEMAN
IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS REDUCED TO A STATE OF COMPLETE DEPENDENCE ON
HIS FATHER'S INVETERATE ENEMY AND LIVES IN HIS OWN HOUSE AS A SERVANT
DEPRIVED OF THE ADVANTAGE OF WAGES QUITE UNABLE TO RIGHT HIMSELF
BECAUSE OF HIS FRIENDLESSNESS AND HIS IGNORANCE THAT HE HAS BEEN
WRONGED
CHAPTER XVIII
THE TWELVE YEARS CONTINUED MRS
DEAN FOLLOWING THAT DISMAL PERIOD WERE
THE HAPPIEST OF MY LIFE MY GREATEST TROUBLES IN THEIR PASSAGE ROSE FROM
OUR LITTLE LADY'S TRIFLING ILLNESSES WHICH SHE HAD TO EXPERIENCE IN
COMMON WITH ALL CHILDREN RICH AND POOR
FOR THE REST AFTER THE FIRST
SIX MONTHS SHE GREW LIKE A LARCH AND COULD WALK AND TALK TOO IN HER
OWN WAY BEFORE THE HEATH BLOSSOMED A SECOND TIME OVER MRS
LINTON'S
DUST
SHE WAS THE MOST WINNING THING THAT EVER BROUGHT SUNSHINE INTO A
DESOLATE HOUSE A REAL BEAUTY IN FACE WITH THE EARNSHAWS' HANDSOME DARK
EYES BUT THE LINTONS' FAIR SKIN AND SMALL FEATURES AND YELLOW CURLING
HAIR
HER SPIRIT WAS HIGH THOUGH NOT ROUGH AND QUALIFIED BY A HEART
SENSITIVE AND LIVELY TO EXCESS IN ITS AFFECTIONS
THAT CAPACITY FOR
INTENSE ATTACHMENTS REMINDED ME OF HER MOTHER STILL SHE DID NOT RESEMBLE
HER FOR SHE COULD BE SOFT AND MILD AS A DOVE AND SHE HAD A GENTLE VOICE
AND PENSIVE EXPRESSION HER ANGER WAS NEVER FURIOUS HER LOVE NEVER
FIERCE IT WAS DEEP AND TENDER
HOWEVER IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE
HAD FAULTS TO FOIL HER GIFTS
A PROPENSITY TO BE SAUCY WAS ONE AND A
PERVERSE WILL THAT INDULGED CHILDREN INVARIABLY ACQUIRE WHETHER THEY BE
GOOD TEMPERED OR CROSS
IF A SERVANT CHANCED TO VEX HER IT WAS
ALWAYS 'I SHALL TELL PAPA AND IF HE REPROVED HER EVEN BY A LOOK YOU
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT A HEART BREAKING BUSINESS I DON'T BELIEVE HE EVER
DID SPEAK A HARSH WORD TO HER
HE TOOK HER EDUCATION ENTIRELY ON
HIMSELF AND MADE IT AN AMUSEMENT
FORTUNATELY CURIOSITY AND A QUICK
INTELLECT MADE HER AN APT SCHOLAR SHE LEARNED RAPIDLY AND EAGERLY AND
DID HONOUR TO HIS TEACHING
TILL SHE REACHED THE AGE OF THIRTEEN SHE HAD NOT ONCE BEEN BEYOND THE
RANGE OF THE PARK BY HERSELF
MR
LINTON WOULD TAKE HER WITH HIM A MILE
OR SO OUTSIDE ON RARE OCCASIONS BUT HE TRUSTED HER TO NO ONE ELSE
GIMMERTON WAS AN UNSUBSTANTIAL NAME IN HER EARS THE CHAPEL THE ONLY
BUILDING SHE HAD APPROACHED OR ENTERED EXCEPT HER OWN HOME
WUTHERING
HEIGHTS AND MR
HEATHCLIFF DID NOT EXIST FOR HER SHE WAS A PERFECT
RECLUSE AND APPARENTLY PERFECTLY CONTENTED
SOMETIMES INDEED WHILE
SURVEYING THE COUNTRY FROM HER NURSERY WINDOW SHE WOULD OBSERVE
'ELLEN HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE I CAN WALK TO THE TOP OF THOSE HILLS
I WONDER WHAT LIES ON THE OTHER SIDE IS IT THE SEA
'NO MISS CATHY I WOULD ANSWER 'IT IS HILLS AGAIN JUST LIKE THESE
'AND WHAT ARE THOSE GOLDEN ROCKS LIKE WHEN YOU STAND UNDER THEM SHE
ONCE ASKED
THE ABRUPT DESCENT OF PENISTONE CRAGS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTED HER NOTICE
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SETTING SUN SHONE ON IT AND THE TOPMOST HEIGHTS AND
THE WHOLE EXTENT OF LANDSCAPE BESIDES LAY IN SHADOW
I EXPLAINED THAT
THEY WERE BARE MASSES OF STONE WITH HARDLY ENOUGH EARTH IN THEIR CLEFTS
TO NOURISH A STUNTED TREE
'AND WHY ARE THEY BRIGHT SO LONG AFTER IT IS EVENING HERE SHE PURSUED
'BECAUSE THEY ARE A GREAT DEAL HIGHER UP THAN WE ARE REPLIED I 'YOU
COULD NOT CLIMB THEM THEY ARE TOO HIGH AND STEEP
IN WINTER THE FROST
IS ALWAYS THERE BEFORE IT COMES TO US AND DEEP INTO SUMMER I HAVE FOUND
SNOW UNDER THAT BLACK HOLLOW ON THE NORTH EAST SIDE
'OH YOU HAVE BEEN ON THEM SHE CRIED GLEEFULLY
'THEN I CAN GO TOO
WHEN I AM A WOMAN
HAS PAPA BEEN ELLEN
'PAPA WOULD TELL YOU MISS I ANSWERED HASTILY 'THAT THEY ARE NOT
WORTH THE TROUBLE OF VISITING
THE MOORS WHERE YOU RAMBLE WITH HIM ARE
MUCH NICER AND THRUSHCROSS PARK IS THE FINEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
'BUT I KNOW THE PARK AND I DON'T KNOW THOSE SHE MURMURED TO HERSELF
'AND I SHOULD DELIGHT TO LOOK ROUND ME FROM THE BROW OF THAT TALLEST
POINT MY LITTLE PONY MINNY SHALL TAKE ME SOME TIME
ONE OF THE MAIDS MENTIONING THE FAIRY CAVE QUITE TURNED HER HEAD WITH A
DESIRE TO FULFIL THIS PROJECT SHE TEASED MR
LINTON ABOUT IT AND HE
PROMISED SHE SHOULD HAVE THE JOURNEY WHEN SHE GOT OLDER
BUT MISS
CATHERINE MEASURED HER AGE BY MONTHS AND 'NOW AM I OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO
PENISTONE CRAGS WAS THE CONSTANT QUESTION IN HER MOUTH
THE ROAD
THITHER WOUND CLOSE BY WUTHERING HEIGHTS
EDGAR HAD NOT THE HEART TO
PASS IT SO SHE RECEIVED AS CONSTANTLY THE ANSWER 'NOT YET LOVE NOT
YET
I SAID MRS
HEATHCLIFF LIVED ABOVE A DOZEN YEARS AFTER QUITTING HER
HUSBAND
HER FAMILY WERE OF A DELICATE CONSTITUTION SHE AND EDGAR BOTH
LACKED THE RUDDY HEALTH THAT YOU WILL GENERALLY MEET IN THESE PARTS
WHAT
HER LAST ILLNESS WAS I AM NOT CERTAIN I CONJECTURE THEY DIED OF THE
SAME THING A KIND OF FEVER SLOW AT ITS COMMENCEMENT BUT INCURABLE AND
RAPIDLY CONSUMING LIFE TOWARDS THE CLOSE
SHE WROTE TO INFORM HER
BROTHER OF THE PROBABLE CONCLUSION OF A FOUR MONTHS' INDISPOSITION UNDER
WHICH SHE HAD SUFFERED AND ENTREATED HIM TO COME TO HER IF POSSIBLE
FOR SHE HAD MUCH TO SETTLE AND SHE WISHED TO BID HIM ADIEU AND DELIVER
LINTON SAFELY INTO HIS HANDS
HER HOPE WAS THAT LINTON MIGHT BE LEFT
WITH HIM AS HE HAD BEEN WITH HER HIS FATHER SHE WOULD FAIN CONVINCE
HERSELF HAD NO DESIRE TO ASSUME THE BURDEN OF HIS MAINTENANCE OR
EDUCATION
MY MASTER HESITATED NOT A MOMENT IN COMPLYING WITH HER
REQUEST RELUCTANT AS HE WAS TO LEAVE HOME AT ORDINARY CALLS HE FLEW TO
ANSWER THIS COMMANDING CATHERINE TO MY PECULIAR VIGILANCE IN HIS
ABSENCE WITH REITERATED ORDERS THAT SHE MUST NOT WANDER OUT OF THE PARK
EVEN UNDER MY ESCORT HE DID NOT CALCULATE ON HER GOING UNACCOMPANIED
HE WAS AWAY THREE WEEKS
THE FIRST DAY OR TWO MY CHARGE SAT IN A CORNER
OF THE LIBRARY TOO SAD FOR EITHER READING OR PLAYING IN THAT QUIET
STATE SHE CAUSED ME LITTLE TROUBLE BUT IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY AN INTERVAL
OF IMPATIENT FRETFUL WEARINESS AND BEING TOO BUSY AND TOO OLD THEN TO
RUN UP AND DOWN AMUSING HER I HIT ON A METHOD BY WHICH SHE MIGHT
ENTERTAIN HERSELF
I USED TO SEND HER ON HER TRAVELS ROUND THE
GROUNDS NOW ON FOOT AND NOW ON A PONY INDULGING HER WITH A PATIENT
AUDIENCE OF ALL HER REAL AND IMAGINARY ADVENTURES WHEN SHE RETURNED
THE SUMMER SHONE IN FULL PRIME AND SHE TOOK SUCH A TASTE FOR THIS
SOLITARY RAMBLING THAT SHE OFTEN CONTRIVED TO REMAIN OUT FROM BREAKFAST
TILL TEA AND THEN THE EVENINGS WERE SPENT IN RECOUNTING HER FANCIFUL
TALES
I DID NOT FEAR HER BREAKING BOUNDS BECAUSE THE GATES WERE
GENERALLY LOCKED AND I THOUGHT SHE WOULD SCARCELY VENTURE FORTH ALONE
IF THEY HAD STOOD WIDE OPEN
UNLUCKILY MY CONFIDENCE PROVED MISPLACED
CATHERINE CAME TO ME ONE MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND SAID SHE WAS
THAT DAY AN ARABIAN MERCHANT GOING TO CROSS THE DESERT WITH HIS CARAVAN
AND I MUST GIVE HER PLENTY OF PROVISION FOR HERSELF AND BEASTS A HORSE
AND THREE CAMELS PERSONATED BY A LARGE HOUND AND A COUPLE OF POINTERS
I
GOT TOGETHER GOOD STORE OF DAINTIES AND SLUNG THEM IN A BASKET ON ONE
SIDE OF THE SADDLE AND SHE SPRANG UP AS GAY AS A FAIRY SHELTERED BY HER
WIDE BRIMMED HAT AND GAUZE VEIL FROM THE JULY SUN AND TROTTED OFF WITH A
MERRY LAUGH MOCKING MY CAUTIOUS COUNSEL TO AVOID GALLOPING AND COME
BACK EARLY
THE NAUGHTY THING NEVER MADE HER APPEARANCE AT TEA
ONE
TRAVELLER THE HOUND BEING AN OLD DOG AND FOND OF ITS EASE RETURNED
BUT NEITHER CATHY NOR THE PONY NOR THE TWO POINTERS WERE VISIBLE IN ANY
DIRECTION I DESPATCHED EMISSARIES DOWN THIS PATH AND THAT PATH AND AT
LAST WENT WANDERING IN SEARCH OF HER MYSELF
THERE WAS A LABOURER
WORKING AT A FENCE ROUND A PLANTATION ON THE BORDERS OF THE GROUNDS
I
INQUIRED OF HIM IF HE HAD SEEN OUR YOUNG LADY
'I SAW HER AT MORN HE REPLIED 'SHE WOULD HAVE ME TO CUT HER A HAZEL
SWITCH AND THEN SHE LEAPT HER GALLOWAY OVER THE HEDGE YONDER WHERE IT
IS LOWEST AND GALLOPED OUT OF SIGHT
YOU MAY GUESS HOW I FELT AT HEARING THIS NEWS
IT STRUCK ME DIRECTLY SHE
MUST HAVE STARTED FOR PENISTONE CRAGS
'WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER I
EJACULATED PUSHING THROUGH A GAP WHICH THE MAN WAS REPAIRING AND MAKING
STRAIGHT TO THE HIGH ROAD
I WALKED AS IF FOR A WAGER MILE AFTER MILE
TILL A TURN BROUGHT ME IN VIEW OF THE HEIGHTS BUT NO CATHERINE COULD I
DETECT FAR OR NEAR
THE CRAGS LIE ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF BEYOND MR
HEATHCLIFF'S PLACE AND THAT IS FOUR FROM THE GRANGE SO I BEGAN TO FEAR
NIGHT WOULD FALL ERE I COULD REACH THEM
'AND WHAT IF SHE SHOULD HAVE
SLIPPED IN CLAMBERING AMONG THEM I REFLECTED 'AND BEEN KILLED OR
BROKEN SOME OF HER BONES MY SUSPENSE WAS TRULY PAINFUL AND AT FIRST
IT GAVE ME DELIGHTFUL RELIEF TO OBSERVE IN HURRYING BY THE FARMHOUSE
CHARLIE THE FIERCEST OF THE POINTERS LYING UNDER A WINDOW WITH SWELLED
HEAD AND BLEEDING EAR
I OPENED THE WICKET AND RAN TO THE DOOR KNOCKING
VEHEMENTLY FOR ADMITTANCE
A WOMAN WHOM I KNEW AND WHO FORMERLY LIVED
AT GIMMERTON ANSWERED SHE HAD BEEN SERVANT THERE SINCE THE DEATH OF MR
EARNSHAW
'AH SAID SHE 'YOU ARE COME A SEEKING YOUR LITTLE MISTRESS DON'T BE
FRIGHTENED
SHE'S HERE SAFE BUT I'M GLAD IT ISN'T THE MASTER
'HE IS NOT AT HOME THEN IS HE I PANTED QUITE BREATHLESS WITH QUICK
WALKING AND ALARM
'NO NO SHE REPLIED 'BOTH HE AND JOSEPH ARE OFF AND I THINK THEY
WON'T RETURN THIS HOUR OR MORE
STEP IN AND REST YOU A BIT
I ENTERED AND BEHELD MY STRAY LAMB SEATED ON THE HEARTH ROCKING HERSELF
IN A LITTLE CHAIR THAT HAD BEEN HER MOTHER'S WHEN A CHILD
HER HAT WAS
HUNG AGAINST THE WALL AND SHE SEEMED PERFECTLY AT HOME LAUGHING AND
CHATTERING IN THE BEST SPIRITS IMAGINABLE TO HARETON NOW A GREAT
STRONG LAD OF EIGHTEEN WHO STARED AT HER WITH CONSIDERABLE CURIOSITY AND
ASTONISHMENT COMPREHENDING PRECIOUS LITTLE OF THE FLUENT SUCCESSION OF
REMARKS AND QUESTIONS WHICH HER TONGUE NEVER CEASED POURING FORTH
'VERY WELL MISS I EXCLAIMED CONCEALING MY JOY UNDER AN ANGRY
COUNTENANCE
'THIS IS YOUR LAST RIDE TILL PAPA COMES BACK
I'LL NOT
TRUST YOU OVER THE THRESHOLD AGAIN YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY GIRL
'AHA ELLEN SHE CRIED GAILY JUMPING UP AND RUNNING TO MY SIDE
'I
SHALL HAVE A PRETTY STORY TO TELL TO NIGHT AND SO YOU'VE FOUND ME OUT
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HERE IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE
'PUT THAT HAT ON AND HOME AT ONCE SAID I
'I'M DREADFULLY GRIEVED AT
YOU MISS CATHY YOU'VE DONE EXTREMELY WRONG IT'S NO USE POUTING AND
CRYING THAT WON'T REPAY THE TROUBLE I'VE HAD SCOURING THE COUNTRY AFTER
YOU
TO THINK HOW MR
LINTON CHARGED ME TO KEEP YOU IN AND YOU STEALING
OFF SO IT SHOWS YOU ARE A CUNNING LITTLE FOX AND NOBODY WILL PUT FAITH
IN YOU ANY MORE
'WHAT HAVE I DONE SOBBED SHE INSTANTLY CHECKED
'PAPA CHARGED ME
NOTHING HE'LL NOT SCOLD ME ELLEN HE'S NEVER CROSS LIKE YOU
'COME COME I REPEATED
'I'LL TIE THE RIBAND
NOW LET US HAVE NO
PETULANCE
OH FOR SHAME YOU THIRTEEN YEARS OLD AND SUCH A BABY
THIS EXCLAMATION WAS CAUSED BY HER PUSHING THE HAT FROM HER HEAD AND
RETREATING TO THE CHIMNEY OUT OF MY REACH
'NAY SAID THE SERVANT 'DON'T BE HARD ON THE BONNY LASS MRS
DEAN
WE
MADE HER STOP SHE'D FAIN HAVE RIDDEN FORWARDS AFEARD YOU SHOULD BE
UNEASY
HARETON OFFERED TO GO WITH HER AND I THOUGHT HE SHOULD IT'S A
WILD ROAD OVER THE HILLS
HARETON DURING THE DISCUSSION STOOD WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS TOO
AWKWARD TO SPEAK THOUGH HE LOOKED AS IF HE DID NOT RELISH MY INTRUSION
'HOW LONG AM I TO WAIT I CONTINUED DISREGARDING THE WOMAN'S
INTERFERENCE
'IT WILL BE DARK IN TEN MINUTES
WHERE IS THE PONY MISS
CATHY AND WHERE IS PHOENIX I SHALL LEAVE YOU UNLESS YOU BE QUICK SO
PLEASE YOURSELF
'THE PONY IS IN THE YARD SHE REPLIED 'AND PHOENIX IS SHUT IN THERE
HE'S BITTEN AND SO IS CHARLIE
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
BUT YOU ARE IN A BAD TEMPER AND DON'T DESERVE TO HEAR
I PICKED UP HER HAT AND APPROACHED TO REINSTATE IT BUT PERCEIVING THAT
THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE TOOK HER PART SHE COMMENCED CAPERING ROUND THE
ROOM AND ON MY GIVING CHASE RAN LIKE A MOUSE OVER AND UNDER AND BEHIND
THE FURNITURE RENDERING IT RIDICULOUS FOR ME TO PURSUE
HARETON AND THE
WOMAN LAUGHED AND SHE JOINED THEM AND WAXED MORE IMPERTINENT STILL
TILL I CRIED IN GREAT IRRITATION 'WELL MISS CATHY IF YOU WERE AWARE
WHOSE HOUSE THIS IS YOU'D BE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET OUT
'IT'S YOUR FATHER'S ISN'T IT SAID SHE TURNING TO HARETON
'NAY HE REPLIED LOOKING DOWN AND BLUSHING BASHFULLY
HE COULD NOT STAND A STEADY GAZE FROM HER EYES THOUGH THEY WERE JUST HIS
OWN
'WHOSE THEN YOUR MASTER'S SHE ASKED
HE COLOURED DEEPER WITH A DIFFERENT FEELING MUTTERED AN OATH AND
TURNED AWAY
'WHO IS HIS MASTER CONTINUED THE TIRESOME GIRL APPEALING TO ME
'HE
TALKED ABOUT OUR HOUSE AND OUR FOLK I THOUGHT HE HAD BEEN THE
OWNER'S SON
AND HE NEVER SAID MISS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE SHOULDN'T HE
IF HE'S A SERVANT
HARETON GREW BLACK AS A THUNDER CLOUD AT THIS CHILDISH SPEECH
I
SILENTLY SHOOK MY QUESTIONER AND AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN EQUIPPING HER FOR
DEPARTURE
'NOW GET MY HORSE SHE SAID ADDRESSING HER UNKNOWN KINSMAN AS SHE
WOULD ONE OF THE STABLE BOYS AT THE GRANGE
'AND YOU MAY COME WITH ME
I
WANT TO SEE WHERE THE GOBLIN HUNTER RISES IN THE MARSH AND TO HEAR ABOUT
THE FAIRISHES AS YOU CALL THEM BUT MAKE HASTE WHAT'S THE MATTER
GET MY HORSE I SAY
'I'LL SEE THEE DAMNED BEFORE I BE THY SERVANT GROWLED THE LAD
'YOU'LL SEE ME WHAT ASKED CATHERINE IN SURPRISE
'DAMNED THOU SAUCY WITCH HE REPLIED
'THERE MISS CATHY YOU SEE YOU HAVE GOT INTO PRETTY COMPANY I
INTERPOSED
'NICE WORDS TO BE USED TO A YOUNG LADY PRAY DON'T BEGIN TO
DISPUTE WITH HIM
COME LET US SEEK FOR MINNY OURSELVES AND BEGONE
'BUT ELLEN CRIED SHE STARING FIXED IN ASTONISHMENT 'HOW DARE HE
SPEAK SO TO ME MUSTN'T HE BE MADE TO DO AS I ASK HIM YOU WICKED
CREATURE I SHALL TELL PAPA WHAT YOU SAID NOW THEN
HARETON DID NOT APPEAR TO FEEL THIS THREAT SO THE TEARS SPRANG INTO HER
EYES WITH INDIGNATION
'YOU BRING THE PONY SHE EXCLAIMED TURNING TO
THE WOMAN 'AND LET MY DOG FREE THIS MOMENT
'SOFTLY MISS ANSWERED SHE ADDRESSED 'YOU'LL LOSE NOTHING BY BEING
CIVIL
THOUGH MR
HARETON THERE BE NOT THE MASTER'S SON HE'S YOUR
COUSIN AND I WAS NEVER HIRED TO SERVE YOU
HE MY COUSIN CRIED CATHY WITH A SCORNFUL LAUGH
'YES INDEED RESPONDED HER REPROVER
'OH ELLEN DON'T LET THEM SAY SUCH THINGS SHE PURSUED IN GREAT
TROUBLE
'PAPA IS GONE TO FETCH MY COUSIN FROM LONDON MY COUSIN IS A
GENTLEMAN'S SON
THAT MY SHE STOPPED AND WEPT OUTRIGHT UPSET AT THE
BARE NOTION OF RELATIONSHIP WITH SUCH A CLOWN
'HUSH HUSH I WHISPERED 'PEOPLE CAN HAVE MANY COUSINS AND OF ALL
SORTS MISS CATHY WITHOUT BEING ANY THE WORSE FOR IT ONLY THEY NEEDN'T
KEEP THEIR COMPANY IF THEY BE DISAGREEABLE AND BAD
'HE'S NOT HE'S NOT MY COUSIN ELLEN SHE WENT ON GATHERING FRESH GRIEF
FROM REFLECTION AND FLINGING HERSELF INTO MY ARMS FOR REFUGE FROM THE
IDEA
I WAS MUCH VEXED AT HER AND THE SERVANT FOR THEIR MUTUAL REVELATIONS
HAVING NO DOUBT OF LINTON'S APPROACHING ARRIVAL COMMUNICATED BY THE
FORMER BEING REPORTED TO MR
HEATHCLIFF AND FEELING AS CONFIDENT THAT
CATHERINE'S FIRST THOUGHT ON HER FATHER'S RETURN WOULD BE TO SEEK AN
EXPLANATION OF THE LATTER'S ASSERTION CONCERNING HER RUDE BRED KINDRED
HARETON RECOVERING FROM HIS DISGUST AT BEING TAKEN FOR A SERVANT SEEMED
MOVED BY HER DISTRESS AND HAVING FETCHED THE PONY ROUND TO THE DOOR HE
TOOK TO PROPITIATE HER A FINE CROOKED LEGGED TERRIER WHELP FROM THE
KENNEL AND PUTTING IT INTO HER HAND BID HER WHIST FOR HE MEANT NOUGHT
PAUSING IN HER LAMENTATIONS SHE SURVEYED HIM WITH A GLANCE OF AWE AND
HORROR THEN BURST FORTH ANEW
I COULD SCARCELY REFRAIN FROM SMILING AT THIS ANTIPATHY TO THE POOR
FELLOW WHO WAS A WELL MADE ATHLETIC YOUTH GOOD LOOKING IN FEATURES
AND STOUT AND HEALTHY BUT ATTIRED IN GARMENTS BEFITTING HIS DAILY
OCCUPATIONS OF WORKING ON THE FARM AND LOUNGING AMONG THE MOORS AFTER
RABBITS AND GAME
STILL I THOUGHT I COULD DETECT IN HIS PHYSIOGNOMY A
MIND OWNING BETTER QUALITIES THAN HIS FATHER EVER POSSESSED
GOOD THINGS
LOST AMID A WILDERNESS OF WEEDS TO BE SURE WHOSE RANKNESS FAR
OVER TOPPED THEIR NEGLECTED GROWTH YET NOTWITHSTANDING EVIDENCE OF A
WEALTHY SOIL THAT MIGHT YIELD LUXURIANT CROPS UNDER OTHER AND FAVOURABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES
MR
HEATHCLIFF I BELIEVE HAD NOT TREATED HIM PHYSICALLY
ILL THANKS TO HIS FEARLESS NATURE WHICH OFFERED NO TEMPTATION TO THAT
COURSE OF OPPRESSION HE HAD NONE OF THE TIMID SUSCEPTIBILITY THAT WOULD
HAVE GIVEN ZEST TO ILL TREATMENT IN HEATHCLIFF'S JUDGMENT
HE APPEARED
TO HAVE BENT HIS MALEVOLENCE ON MAKING HIM A BRUTE HE WAS NEVER TAUGHT
TO READ OR WRITE NEVER REBUKED FOR ANY BAD HABIT WHICH DID NOT ANNOY HIS
KEEPER NEVER LED A SINGLE STEP TOWARDS VIRTUE OR GUARDED BY A SINGLE
PRECEPT AGAINST VICE
AND FROM WHAT I HEARD JOSEPH CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO
HIS DETERIORATION BY A NARROW MINDED PARTIALITY WHICH PROMPTED HIM TO
FLATTER AND PET HIM AS A BOY BECAUSE HE WAS THE HEAD OF THE OLD FAMILY
AND AS HE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF ACCUSING CATHERINE EARNSHAW AND
HEATHCLIFF WHEN CHILDREN OF PUTTING THE MASTER PAST HIS PATIENCE AND
COMPELLING HIM TO SEEK SOLACE IN DRINK BY WHAT HE TERMED THEIR 'OFFALD
WAYS SO AT PRESENT HE LAID THE WHOLE BURDEN OF HARETON'S FAULTS ON THE
SHOULDERS OF THE USURPER OF HIS PROPERTY
IF THE LAD SWORE HE WOULDN'T
CORRECT HIM NOR HOWEVER CULPABLY HE BEHAVED
IT GAVE JOSEPH
SATISFACTION APPARENTLY TO WATCH HIM GO THE WORST LENGTHS HE ALLOWED
THAT THE LAD WAS RUINED THAT HIS SOUL WAS ABANDONED TO PERDITION BUT
THEN HE REFLECTED THAT HEATHCLIFF MUST ANSWER FOR IT
HARETON'S BLOOD
WOULD BE REQUIRED AT HIS HANDS AND THERE LAY IMMENSE CONSOLATION IN THAT
THOUGHT
JOSEPH HAD INSTILLED INTO HIM A PRIDE OF NAME AND OF HIS
LINEAGE HE WOULD HAD HE DARED HAVE FOSTERED HATE BETWEEN HIM AND THE
PRESENT OWNER OF THE HEIGHTS BUT HIS DREAD OF THAT OWNER AMOUNTED TO
SUPERSTITION AND HE CONFINED HIS FEELINGS REGARDING HIM TO MUTTERED
INNUENDOES AND PRIVATE COMMINATIONS
I DON'T PRETEND TO BE INTIMATELY
ACQUAINTED WITH THE MODE OF LIVING CUSTOMARY IN THOSE DAYS AT WUTHERING
HEIGHTS I ONLY SPEAK FROM HEARSAY FOR I SAW LITTLE
THE VILLAGERS
AFFIRMED MR
HEATHCLIFF WAS NEAR AND A CRUEL HARD LANDLORD TO HIS
TENANTS BUT THE HOUSE INSIDE HAD REGAINED ITS ANCIENT ASPECT OF
COMFORT UNDER FEMALE MANAGEMENT AND THE SCENES OF RIOT COMMON IN
HINDLEY'S TIME WERE NOT NOW ENACTED WITHIN ITS WALLS
THE MASTER WAS TOO
GLOOMY TO SEEK COMPANIONSHIP WITH ANY PEOPLE GOOD OR BAD AND HE IS YET
THIS HOWEVER IS NOT MAKING PROGRESS WITH MY STORY
MISS CATHY REJECTED
THE PEACE OFFERING OF THE TERRIER AND DEMANDED HER OWN DOGS CHARLIE AND
PHOENIX
THEY CAME LIMPING AND HANGING THEIR HEADS AND WE SET OUT FOR
HOME SADLY OUT OF SORTS EVERY ONE OF US
I COULD NOT WRING FROM MY
LITTLE LADY HOW SHE HAD SPENT THE DAY EXCEPT THAT AS I SUPPOSED THE
GOAL OF HER PILGRIMAGE WAS PENISTONE CRAGS AND SHE ARRIVED WITHOUT
ADVENTURE TO THE GATE OF THE FARM HOUSE WHEN HARETON HAPPENED TO ISSUE
FORTH ATTENDED BY SOME CANINE FOLLOWERS WHO ATTACKED HER TRAIN
THEY
HAD A SMART BATTLE BEFORE THEIR OWNERS COULD SEPARATE THEM THAT FORMED
AN INTRODUCTION
CATHERINE TOLD HARETON WHO SHE WAS AND WHERE SHE WAS
GOING AND ASKED HIM TO SHOW HER THE WAY FINALLY BEGUILING HIM TO
ACCOMPANY HER
HE OPENED THE MYSTERIES OF THE FAIRY CAVE AND TWENTY
OTHER QUEER PLACES
BUT BEING IN DISGRACE I WAS NOT FAVOURED WITH A
DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERESTING OBJECTS SHE SAW
I COULD GATHER HOWEVER
THAT HER GUIDE HAD BEEN A FAVOURITE TILL SHE HURT HIS FEELINGS BY
ADDRESSING HIM AS A SERVANT AND HEATHCLIFF'S HOUSEKEEPER HURT HERS BY
CALLING HIM HER COUSIN
THEN THE LANGUAGE HE HAD HELD TO HER RANKLED IN
HER HEART SHE WHO WAS ALWAYS 'LOVE AND 'DARLING AND 'QUEEN AND
'ANGEL WITH EVERYBODY AT THE GRANGE TO BE INSULTED SO SHOCKINGLY BY A
STRANGER SHE DID NOT COMPREHEND IT AND HARD WORK I HAD TO OBTAIN A
PROMISE THAT SHE WOULD NOT LAY THE GRIEVANCE BEFORE HER FATHER
I
EXPLAINED HOW HE OBJECTED TO THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD AT THE HEIGHTS AND HOW
SORRY HE WOULD BE TO FIND SHE HAD BEEN THERE BUT I INSISTED MOST ON THE
FACT THAT IF SHE REVEALED MY NEGLIGENCE OF HIS ORDERS HE WOULD PERHAPS
BE SO ANGRY THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO LEAVE AND CATHY COULDN'T BEAR THAT
PROSPECT SHE PLEDGED HER WORD AND KEPT IT FOR MY SAKE
AFTER ALL SHE
WAS A SWEET LITTLE GIRL
CHAPTER XIX
A LETTER EDGED WITH BLACK ANNOUNCED THE DAY OF MY MASTER'S RETURN
ISABELLA WAS DEAD AND HE WROTE TO BID ME GET MOURNING FOR HIS DAUGHTER
AND ARRANGE A ROOM AND OTHER ACCOMMODATIONS FOR HIS YOUTHFUL NEPHEW
CATHERINE RAN WILD WITH JOY AT THE IDEA OF WELCOMING HER FATHER BACK AND
INDULGED MOST SANGUINE ANTICIPATIONS OF THE INNUMERABLE EXCELLENCIES OF
HER 'REAL' COUSIN
THE EVENING OF THEIR EXPECTED ARRIVAL CAME
SINCE
EARLY MORNING SHE HAD BEEN BUSY ORDERING HER OWN SMALL AFFAIRS AND NOW
ATTIRED IN HER NEW BLACK FROCK POOR THING HER AUNT'S DEATH IMPRESSED
HER WITH NO DEFINITE SORROW SHE OBLIGED ME BY CONSTANT WORRYING TO
WALK WITH HER DOWN THROUGH THE GROUNDS TO MEET THEM
'LINTON IS JUST SIX MONTHS YOUNGER THAN I AM SHE CHATTERED AS WE
STROLLED LEISURELY OVER THE SWELLS AND HOLLOWS OF MOSSY TURF UNDER
SHADOW OF THE TREES
'HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WILL BE TO HAVE HIM FOR A
PLAYFELLOW AUNT ISABELLA SENT PAPA A BEAUTIFUL LOCK OF HIS HAIR IT WAS
LIGHTER THAN MINE MORE FLAXEN AND QUITE AS FINE
I HAVE IT CAREFULLY
PRESERVED IN A LITTLE GLASS BOX AND I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT WHAT A PLEASURE
IT WOULD BE TO SEE ITS OWNER
OH I AM HAPPY AND PAPA DEAR DEAR PAPA
COME ELLEN LET US RUN COME RUN
SHE RAN AND RETURNED AND RAN AGAIN MANY TIMES BEFORE MY SOBER FOOTSTEPS
REACHED THE GATE AND THEN SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE GRASSY BANK BESIDE
THE PATH AND TRIED TO WAIT PATIENTLY BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE SHE
COULDN'T BE STILL A MINUTE
'HOW LONG THEY ARE SHE EXCLAIMED
'AH I SEE SOME DUST ON THE
ROAD THEY ARE COMING NO WHEN WILL THEY BE HERE MAY WE NOT GO A
LITTLE WAY HALF A MILE ELLEN ONLY JUST HALF A MILE DO SAY YES TO
THAT CLUMP OF BIRCHES AT THE TURN
I REFUSED STAUNCHLY
AT LENGTH HER SUSPENSE WAS ENDED THE TRAVELLING
CARRIAGE ROLLED IN SIGHT
MISS CATHY SHRIEKED AND STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS
AS SOON AS SHE CAUGHT HER FATHER'S FACE LOOKING FROM THE WINDOW
HE
DESCENDED NEARLY AS EAGER AS HERSELF AND A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL
ELAPSED ERE THEY HAD A THOUGHT TO SPARE FOR ANY BUT THEMSELVES
WHILE
THEY EXCHANGED CARESSES I TOOK A PEEP IN TO SEE AFTER LINTON
HE WAS
ASLEEP IN A CORNER WRAPPED IN A WARM FUR LINED CLOAK AS IF IT HAD BEEN
WINTER
A PALE DELICATE EFFEMINATE BOY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR
MY MASTER'S YOUNGER BROTHER SO STRONG WAS THE RESEMBLANCE BUT THERE WAS
A SICKLY PEEVISHNESS IN HIS ASPECT THAT EDGAR LINTON NEVER HAD
THE
LATTER SAW ME LOOKING AND HAVING SHAKEN HANDS ADVISED ME TO CLOSE THE
DOOR AND LEAVE HIM UNDISTURBED FOR THE JOURNEY HAD FATIGUED HIM
CATHY
WOULD FAIN HAVE TAKEN ONE GLANCE BUT HER FATHER TOLD HER TO COME AND
THEY WALKED TOGETHER UP THE PARK WHILE I HASTENED BEFORE TO PREPARE THE
SERVANTS
'NOW DARLING SAID MR
LINTON ADDRESSING HIS DAUGHTER AS THEY HALTED
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT STEPS 'YOUR COUSIN IS NOT SO STRONG OR SO
MERRY AS YOU ARE AND HE HAS LOST HIS MOTHER REMEMBER A VERY SHORT TIME
SINCE THEREFORE DON'T EXPECT HIM TO PLAY AND RUN ABOUT WITH YOU
DIRECTLY
AND DON'T HARASS HIM MUCH BY TALKING LET HIM BE QUIET THIS
EVENING AT LEAST WILL YOU
'YES YES PAPA ANSWERED CATHERINE 'BUT I DO WANT TO SEE HIM AND HE
HASN'T ONCE LOOKED OUT
THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AND THE SLEEPER BEING ROUSED WAS LIFTED TO THE
GROUND BY HIS UNCLE
'THIS IS YOUR COUSIN CATHY LINTON HE SAID PUTTING THEIR LITTLE HANDS
TOGETHER
'SHE'S FOND OF YOU ALREADY AND MIND YOU DON'T GRIEVE HER BY
CRYING TO NIGHT
TRY TO BE CHEERFUL NOW THE TRAVELLING IS AT AN END
AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT REST AND AMUSE YOURSELF AS YOU PLEASE
'LET ME GO TO BED THEN ANSWERED THE BOY SHRINKING FROM CATHERINE'S
SALUTE AND HE PUT HIS FINGERS TO REMOVE INCIPIENT TEARS
'COME COME THERE'S A GOOD CHILD I WHISPERED LEADING HIM IN
'YOU'LL
MAKE HER WEEP TOO SEE HOW SORRY SHE IS FOR YOU
I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER IT WAS SORROW FOR HIM BUT HIS COUSIN PUT ON AS SAD
A COUNTENANCE AS HIMSELF AND RETURNED TO HER FATHER
ALL THREE ENTERED
AND MOUNTED TO THE LIBRARY WHERE TEA WAS LAID READY
I PROCEEDED TO
REMOVE LINTON'S CAP AND MANTLE AND PLACED HIM ON A CHAIR BY THE TABLE
BUT HE WAS NO SOONER SEATED THAN HE BEGAN TO CRY AFRESH
MY MASTER
INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
'I CAN'T SIT ON A CHAIR SOBBED THE BOY
'GO TO THE SOFA THEN AND ELLEN SHALL BRING YOU SOME TEA ANSWERED HIS
UNCLE PATIENTLY
HE HAD BEEN GREATLY TRIED DURING THE JOURNEY I FELT CONVINCED BY HIS
FRETFUL AILING CHARGE
LINTON SLOWLY TRAILED HIMSELF OFF AND LAY DOWN
CATHY CARRIED A FOOTSTOOL AND HER CUP TO HIS SIDE
AT FIRST SHE SAT
SILENT BUT THAT COULD NOT LAST SHE HAD RESOLVED TO MAKE A PET OF HER
LITTLE COUSIN AS SHE WOULD HAVE HIM TO BE AND SHE COMMENCED STROKING
HIS CURLS AND KISSING HIS CHEEK AND OFFERING HIM TEA IN HER SAUCER
LIKE A BABY
THIS PLEASED HIM FOR HE WAS NOT MUCH BETTER HE DRIED HIS
EYES AND LIGHTENED INTO A FAINT SMILE
'OH HE'LL DO VERY WELL SAID THE MASTER TO ME AFTER WATCHING THEM A
MINUTE
'VERY WELL IF WE CAN KEEP HIM ELLEN
THE COMPANY OF A CHILD
OF HIS OWN AGE WILL INSTIL NEW SPIRIT INTO HIM SOON AND BY WISHING FOR
STRENGTH HE'LL GAIN IT
'AY IF WE CAN KEEP HIM I MUSED TO MYSELF AND SORE MISGIVINGS CAME
OVER ME THAT THERE WAS SLIGHT HOPE OF THAT
AND THEN I THOUGHT HOW
EVER WILL THAT WEAKLING LIVE AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS BETWEEN HIS FATHER
AND HARETON WHAT PLAYMATES AND INSTRUCTORS THEY'LL BE
OUR DOUBTS WERE
PRESENTLY DECIDED EVEN EARLIER THAN I EXPECTED
I HAD JUST TAKEN THE
CHILDREN UP STAIRS AFTER TEA WAS FINISHED AND SEEN LINTON ASLEEP HE
WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO LEAVE HIM TILL THAT WAS THE CASE I HAD COME DOWN
AND WAS STANDING BY THE TABLE IN THE HALL LIGHTING A BEDROOM CANDLE FOR
MR
EDGAR WHEN A MAID STEPPED OUT OF THE KITCHEN AND INFORMED ME THAT
MR
HEATHCLIFF'S SERVANT JOSEPH WAS AT THE DOOR AND WISHED TO SPEAK WITH
THE MASTER
'I SHALL ASK HIM WHAT HE WANTS FIRST I SAID IN CONSIDERABLE
TREPIDATION
'A VERY UNLIKELY HOUR TO BE TROUBLING PEOPLE AND THE
INSTANT THEY HAVE RETURNED FROM A LONG JOURNEY
I DON'T THINK THE MASTER
CAN SEE HIM
JOSEPH HAD ADVANCED THROUGH THE KITCHEN AS I UTTERED THESE WORDS AND NOW
PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THE HALL
HE WAS DONNED IN HIS SUNDAY GARMENTS
WITH HIS MOST SANCTIMONIOUS AND SOUREST FACE AND HOLDING HIS HAT IN ONE
HAND AND HIS STICK IN THE OTHER HE PROCEEDED TO CLEAN HIS SHOES ON THE
MAT
'GOOD EVENING JOSEPH I SAID COLDLY
'WHAT BUSINESS BRINGS YOU HERE
TO NIGHT
'IT'S MAISTER LINTON I MUN SPAKE TO HE ANSWERED WAVING ME DISDAINFULLY
ASIDE
'MR
LINTON IS GOING TO BED UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO SAY
I'M SURE HE WON'T HEAR IT NOW I CONTINUED
'YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN IN
THERE AND ENTRUST YOUR MESSAGE TO ME
'WHICH IS HIS RAHM PURSUED THE FELLOW SURVEYING THE RANGE OF CLOSED
DOORS
I PERCEIVED HE WAS BENT ON REFUSING MY MEDIATION SO VERY RELUCTANTLY I
WENT UP TO THE LIBRARY AND ANNOUNCED THE UNSEASONABLE VISITOR ADVISING
THAT HE SHOULD BE DISMISSED TILL NEXT DAY
MR
LINTON HAD NO TIME TO
EMPOWER ME TO DO SO FOR JOSEPH MOUNTED CLOSE AT MY HEELS AND PUSHING
INTO THE APARTMENT PLANTED HIMSELF AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE TABLE WITH
HIS TWO FISTS CLAPPED ON THE HEAD OF HIS STICK AND BEGAN IN AN ELEVATED
TONE AS IF ANTICIPATING OPPOSITION
'HATHECLIFF HAS SENT ME FOR HIS LAD AND I MUNN'T GOA BACK 'BOUT HIM
EDGAR LINTON WAS SILENT A MINUTE AN EXPRESSION OF EXCEEDING SORROW
OVERCAST HIS FEATURES HE WOULD HAVE PITIED THE CHILD ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT
BUT RECALLING ISABELLA'S HOPES AND FEARS AND ANXIOUS WISHES FOR HER
SON AND HER COMMENDATIONS OF HIM TO HIS CARE HE GRIEVED BITTERLY AT THE
PROSPECT OF YIELDING HIM UP AND SEARCHED IN HIS HEART HOW IT MIGHT BE
AVOIDED
NO PLAN OFFERED ITSELF THE VERY EXHIBITION OF ANY DESIRE TO
KEEP HIM WOULD HAVE RENDERED THE CLAIMANT MORE PEREMPTORY THERE WAS
NOTHING LEFT BUT TO RESIGN HIM
HOWEVER HE WAS NOT GOING TO ROUSE HIM
FROM HIS SLEEP
'TELL MR
HEATHCLIFF HE ANSWERED CALMLY 'THAT HIS SON SHALL COME TO
WUTHERING HEIGHTS TO MORROW
HE IS IN BED AND TOO TIRED TO GO THE
DISTANCE NOW
YOU MAY ALSO TELL HIM THAT THE MOTHER OF LINTON DESIRED
HIM TO REMAIN UNDER MY GUARDIANSHIP AND AT PRESENT HIS HEALTH IS VERY
PRECARIOUS
'NOA SAID JOSEPH GIVING A THUD WITH HIS PROP ON THE FLOOR AND
ASSUMING AN AUTHORITATIVE AIR
'NOA THAT MEANS NAUGHT
HATHECLIFF MAKS
NOA 'COUNT O' T' MOTHER NOR YE NORTHER BUT HE'LL HEU' HIS LAD UND I
MUN TAK' HIM SOA NOW YE KNAW
'YOU SHALL NOT TO NIGHT ANSWERED LINTON DECISIVELY
'WALK DOWN STAIRS
AT ONCE AND REPEAT TO YOUR MASTER WHAT I HAVE SAID
ELLEN SHOW HIM
DOWN
GO
AND AIDING THE INDIGNANT ELDER WITH A LIFT BY THE ARM HE RID THE ROOM
OF HIM AND CLOSED THE DOOR
'VARRAH WEELL SHOUTED JOSEPH AS HE SLOWLY DREW OFF
'TO MORN HE'S
COME HISSELN AND THRUST HIM OUT IF YE DARR
CHAPTER XX
TO OBVIATE THE DANGER OF THIS THREAT BEING FULFILLED MR
LINTON
COMMISSIONED ME TO TAKE THE BOY HOME EARLY ON CATHERINE'S PONY AND
SAID HE 'AS WE SHALL NOW HAVE NO INFLUENCE OVER HIS DESTINY GOOD OR
BAD YOU MUST SAY NOTHING OF WHERE HE IS GONE TO MY DAUGHTER SHE CANNOT
ASSOCIATE WITH HIM HEREAFTER AND IT IS BETTER FOR HER TO REMAIN IN
IGNORANCE OF HIS PROXIMITY LEST SHE SHOULD BE RESTLESS AND ANXIOUS TO
VISIT THE HEIGHTS
MERELY TELL HER HIS FATHER SENT FOR HIM SUDDENLY AND
HE HAS BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE US
LINTON WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO BE ROUSED FROM HIS BED AT FIVE O'CLOCK AND
ASTONISHED TO BE INFORMED THAT HE MUST PREPARE FOR FURTHER TRAVELLING
BUT I SOFTENED OFF THE MATTER BY STATING THAT HE WAS GOING TO SPEND SOME
TIME WITH HIS FATHER MR
HEATHCLIFF WHO WISHED TO SEE HIM SO MUCH HE
DID NOT LIKE TO DEFER THE PLEASURE TILL HE SHOULD RECOVER FROM HIS LATE
JOURNEY
'MY FATHER HE CRIED IN STRANGE PERPLEXITY
'MAMMA NEVER TOLD ME I HAD
A FATHER
WHERE DOES HE LIVE I'D RATHER STAY WITH UNCLE
'HE LIVES A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE GRANGE I REPLIED 'JUST BEYOND
THOSE HILLS NOT SO FAR BUT YOU MAY WALK OVER HERE WHEN YOU GET HEARTY
AND YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO GO HOME AND TO SEE HIM
YOU MUST TRY TO LOVE
HIM AS YOU DID YOUR MOTHER AND THEN HE WILL LOVE YOU
'BUT WHY HAVE I NOT HEARD OF HIM BEFORE ASKED LINTON
'WHY DIDN'T
MAMMA AND HE LIVE TOGETHER AS OTHER PEOPLE DO
'HE HAD BUSINESS TO KEEP HIM IN THE NORTH I ANSWERED 'AND YOUR
MOTHER'S HEALTH REQUIRED HER TO RESIDE IN THE SOUTH
'AND WHY DIDN'T MAMMA SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HIM PERSEVERED THE CHILD
'SHE
OFTEN TALKED OF UNCLE AND I LEARNT TO LOVE HIM LONG AGO
HOW AM I TO
LOVE PAPA I DON'T KNOW HIM
'OH ALL CHILDREN LOVE THEIR PARENTS I SAID
'YOUR MOTHER PERHAPS
THOUGHT YOU WOULD WANT TO BE WITH HIM IF SHE MENTIONED HIM OFTEN TO YOU
LET US MAKE HASTE
AN EARLY RIDE ON SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MORNING IS MUCH
PREFERABLE TO AN HOUR'S MORE SLEEP
'IS SHE TO GO WITH US HE DEMANDED 'THE LITTLE GIRL I SAW YESTERDAY
'NOT NOW REPLIED I
'IS UNCLE HE CONTINUED
'NO I SHALL BE YOUR COMPANION THERE I SAID
LINTON SANK BACK ON HIS PILLOW AND FELL INTO A BROWN STUDY
'I WON'T GO WITHOUT UNCLE HE CRIED AT LENGTH 'I CAN'T TELL WHERE YOU
MEAN TO TAKE ME
I ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE HIM OF THE NAUGHTINESS OF SHOWING RELUCTANCE TO
MEET HIS FATHER STILL HE OBSTINATELY RESISTED ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS
DRESSING AND I HAD TO CALL FOR MY MASTER'S ASSISTANCE IN COAXING HIM OUT
OF BED
THE POOR THING WAS FINALLY GOT OFF WITH SEVERAL DELUSIVE
ASSURANCES THAT HIS ABSENCE SHOULD BE SHORT THAT MR
EDGAR AND CATHY
WOULD VISIT HIM AND OTHER PROMISES EQUALLY ILL FOUNDED WHICH I
INVENTED AND REITERATED AT INTERVALS THROUGHOUT THE WAY
THE PURE
HEATHER SCENTED AIR THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE AND THE GENTLE CANTER OF MINNY
RELIEVED HIS DESPONDENCY AFTER A WHILE
HE BEGAN TO PUT QUESTIONS
CONCERNING HIS NEW HOME AND ITS INHABITANTS WITH GREATER INTEREST AND
LIVELINESS
'IS WUTHERING HEIGHTS AS PLEASANT A PLACE AS THRUSHCROSS GRANGE HE
INQUIRED TURNING TO TAKE A LAST GLANCE INTO THE VALLEY WHENCE A LIGHT
MIST MOUNTED AND FORMED A FLEECY CLOUD ON THE SKIRTS OF THE BLUE
'IT IS NOT SO BURIED IN TREES I REPLIED 'AND IT IS NOT QUITE SO LARGE
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE COUNTRY BEAUTIFULLY ALL ROUND AND THE AIR IS
HEALTHIER FOR YOU FRESHER AND DRIER
YOU WILL PERHAPS THINK THE
BUILDING OLD AND DARK AT FIRST THOUGH IT IS A RESPECTABLE HOUSE THE
NEXT BEST IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
AND YOU WILL HAVE SUCH NICE RAMBLES ON
THE MOORS
HARETON EARNSHAW THAT IS MISS CATHY'S OTHER COUSIN AND SO
YOURS IN A MANNER WILL SHOW YOU ALL THE SWEETEST SPOTS AND YOU CAN
BRING A BOOK IN FINE WEATHER AND MAKE A GREEN HOLLOW YOUR STUDY AND
NOW AND THEN YOUR UNCLE MAY JOIN YOU IN A WALK HE DOES FREQUENTLY
WALK OUT ON THE HILLS
'AND WHAT IS MY FATHER LIKE HE ASKED
'IS HE AS YOUNG AND HANDSOME AS
UNCLE
'HE'S AS YOUNG SAID I 'BUT HE HAS BLACK HAIR AND EYES AND LOOKS
STERNER AND HE IS TALLER AND BIGGER ALTOGETHER
HE'LL NOT SEEM TO YOU
SO GENTLE AND KIND AT FIRST PERHAPS BECAUSE IT IS NOT HIS WAY STILL
MIND YOU BE FRANK AND CORDIAL WITH HIM AND NATURALLY HE'LL BE FONDER OF
YOU THAN ANY UNCLE FOR YOU ARE HIS OWN
'BLACK HAIR AND EYES MUSED LINTON
'I CAN'T FANCY HIM
THEN I AM NOT
LIKE HIM AM I
'NOT MUCH I ANSWERED NOT A MORSEL I THOUGHT SURVEYING WITH REGRET
THE WHITE COMPLEXION AND SLIM FRAME OF MY COMPANION AND HIS LARGE
LANGUID EYES HIS MOTHER'S EYES SAVE THAT UNLESS A MORBID TOUCHINESS
KINDLED THEM A MOMENT THEY HAD NOT A VESTIGE OF HER SPARKLING SPIRIT
'HOW STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD NEVER COME TO SEE MAMMA AND ME HE MURMURED
'HAS HE EVER SEEN ME IF HE HAS I MUST HAVE BEEN A BABY
I REMEMBER
NOT A SINGLE THING ABOUT HIM
'WHY MASTER LINTON SAID I 'THREE HUNDRED MILES IS A GREAT DISTANCE
AND TEN YEARS SEEM VERY DIFFERENT IN LENGTH TO A GROWN UP PERSON COMPARED
WITH WHAT THEY DO TO YOU
IT IS PROBABLE MR
HEATHCLIFF PROPOSED GOING
FROM SUMMER TO SUMMER BUT NEVER FOUND A CONVENIENT OPPORTUNITY AND NOW
IT IS TOO LATE
DON'T TROUBLE HIM WITH QUESTIONS ON THE SUBJECT IT WILL
DISTURB HIM FOR NO GOOD
THE BOY WAS FULLY OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN COGITATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF
THE RIDE TILL WE HALTED BEFORE THE FARMHOUSE GARDEN GATE
I WATCHED TO
CATCH HIS IMPRESSIONS IN HIS COUNTENANCE
HE SURVEYED THE CARVED FRONT
AND LOW BROWED LATTICES THE STRAGGLING GOOSEBERRY BUSHES AND CROOKED
FIRS WITH SOLEMN INTENTNESS AND THEN SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS PRIVATE
FEELINGS ENTIRELY DISAPPROVED OF THE EXTERIOR OF HIS NEW ABODE
BUT HE
HAD SENSE TO POSTPONE COMPLAINING THERE MIGHT BE COMPENSATION WITHIN
BEFORE HE DISMOUNTED I WENT AND OPENED THE DOOR
IT WAS HALF PAST SIX
THE FAMILY HAD JUST FINISHED BREAKFAST THE SERVANT WAS CLEARING AND
WIPING DOWN THE TABLE
JOSEPH STOOD BY HIS MASTER'S CHAIR TELLING SOME
TALE CONCERNING A LAME HORSE AND HARETON WAS PREPARING FOR THE HAYFIELD
'HALLO NELLY SAID MR
HEATHCLIFF WHEN HE SAW ME
'I FEARED I SHOULD
HAVE TO COME DOWN AND FETCH MY PROPERTY MYSELF
YOU'VE BROUGHT IT HAVE
YOU LET US SEE WHAT WE CAN MAKE OF IT
HE GOT UP AND STRODE TO THE DOOR HARETON AND JOSEPH FOLLOWED IN GAPING
CURIOSITY
POOR LINTON RAN A FRIGHTENED EYE OVER THE FACES OF THE THREE
'SURE LY SAID JOSEPH AFTER A GRAVE INSPECTION 'HE'S SWOPPED WI' YE
MAISTER AN' YON'S HIS LASS
HEATHCLIFF HAVING STARED HIS SON INTO AN AGUE OF CONFUSION UTTERED A
SCORNFUL LAUGH
'GOD WHAT A BEAUTY WHAT A LOVELY CHARMING THING HE EXCLAIMED
'HAV'N'T THEY REARED IT ON SNAILS AND SOUR MILK NELLY OH DAMN MY
SOUL BUT THAT'S WORSE THAN I EXPECTED AND THE DEVIL KNOWS I WAS NOT
SANGUINE
I BID THE TREMBLING AND BEWILDERED CHILD GET DOWN AND ENTER
HE DID NOT
THOROUGHLY COMPREHEND THE MEANING OF HIS FATHER'S SPEECH OR WHETHER IT
WERE INTENDED FOR HIM INDEED HE WAS NOT YET CERTAIN THAT THE GRIM
SNEERING STRANGER WAS HIS FATHER
BUT HE CLUNG TO ME WITH GROWING
TREPIDATION AND ON MR
HEATHCLIFF'S TAKING A SEAT AND BIDDING HIM 'COME
HITHER' HE HID HIS FACE ON MY SHOULDER AND WEPT
'TUT TUT SAID HEATHCLIFF STRETCHING OUT A HAND AND DRAGGING HIM
ROUGHLY BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND THEN HOLDING UP HIS HEAD BY THE CHIN
'NONE OF THAT NONSENSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO HURT THEE LINTON ISN'T THAT
THY NAME THOU ART THY MOTHER'S CHILD ENTIRELY WHERE IS MY SHARE IN
THEE PULING CHICKEN
HE TOOK OFF THE BOY'S CAP AND PUSHED BACK HIS THICK FLAXEN CURLS FELT
HIS SLENDER ARMS AND HIS SMALL FINGERS DURING WHICH EXAMINATION LINTON
CEASED CRYING AND LIFTED HIS GREAT BLUE EYES TO INSPECT THE INSPECTOR
'DO YOU KNOW ME ASKED HEATHCLIFF HAVING SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT THE
LIMBS WERE ALL EQUALLY FRAIL AND FEEBLE
'NO SAID LINTON WITH A GAZE OF VACANT FEAR
'YOU'VE HEARD OF ME I DARESAY
'NO HE REPLIED AGAIN
'NO WHAT A SHAME OF YOUR MOTHER NEVER TO WAKEN YOUR FILIAL REGARD FOR
ME YOU ARE MY SON THEN I'LL TELL YOU AND YOUR MOTHER WAS A WICKED
SLUT TO LEAVE YOU IN IGNORANCE OF THE SORT OF FATHER YOU POSSESSED
NOW
DON'T WINCE AND COLOUR UP THOUGH IT IS SOMETHING TO SEE YOU HAVE NOT
WHITE BLOOD
BE A GOOD LAD AND I'LL DO FOR YOU
NELLY IF YOU BE TIRED
YOU MAY SIT DOWN IF NOT GET HOME AGAIN
I GUESS YOU'LL REPORT WHAT YOU
HEAR AND SEE TO THE CIPHER AT THE GRANGE AND THIS THING WON'T BE SETTLED
WHILE YOU LINGER ABOUT IT
'WELL REPLIED I 'I HOPE YOU'LL BE KIND TO THE BOY MR
HEATHCLIFF OR
YOU'LL NOT KEEP HIM LONG AND HE'S ALL YOU HAVE AKIN IN THE WIDE WORLD
THAT YOU WILL EVER KNOW REMEMBER
'I'LL BE VERY KIND TO HIM YOU NEEDN'T FEAR HE SAID LAUGHING
'ONLY
NOBODY ELSE MUST BE KIND TO HIM I'M JEALOUS OF MONOPOLISING HIS
AFFECTION
AND TO BEGIN MY KINDNESS JOSEPH BRING THE LAD SOME
BREAKFAST
HARETON YOU INFERNAL CALF BEGONE TO YOUR WORK
YES NELL
HE ADDED WHEN THEY HAD DEPARTED 'MY SON IS PROSPECTIVE OWNER OF YOUR
PLACE AND I SHOULD NOT WISH HIM TO DIE TILL I WAS CERTAIN OF BEING HIS
SUCCESSOR
BESIDES HE'S MINE AND I WANT THE TRIUMPH OF SEEING MY
DESCENDANT FAIRLY LORD OF THEIR ESTATES MY CHILD HIRING THEIR CHILDREN
TO TILL THEIR FATHERS' LANDS FOR WAGES
THAT IS THE SOLE CONSIDERATION
WHICH CAN MAKE ME ENDURE THE WHELP I DESPISE HIM FOR HIMSELF AND HATE
HIM FOR THE MEMORIES HE REVIVES BUT THAT CONSIDERATION IS SUFFICIENT
HE'S AS SAFE WITH ME AND SHALL BE TENDED AS CAREFULLY AS YOUR MASTER
TENDS HIS OWN
I HAVE A ROOM UP STAIRS FURNISHED FOR HIM IN HANDSOME
STYLE I'VE ENGAGED A TUTOR ALSO TO COME THREE TIMES A WEEK FROM
TWENTY MILES' DISTANCE TO TEACH HIM WHAT HE PLEASES TO LEARN
I'VE
ORDERED HARETON TO OBEY HIM AND IN FACT I'VE ARRANGED EVERYTHING WITH A
VIEW TO PRESERVE THE SUPERIOR AND THE GENTLEMAN IN HIM ABOVE HIS
ASSOCIATES
I DO REGRET HOWEVER THAT HE SO LITTLE DESERVES THE
TROUBLE IF I WISHED ANY BLESSING IN THE WORLD IT WAS TO FIND HIM A
WORTHY OBJECT OF PRIDE AND I'M BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE
WHEY FACED WHINING WRETCH
WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING JOSEPH RETURNED BEARING A BASIN OF MILK PORRIDGE
AND PLACED IT BEFORE LINTON WHO STIRRED ROUND THE HOMELY MESS WITH A
LOOK OF AVERSION AND AFFIRMED HE COULD NOT EAT IT
I SAW THE OLD
MAN SERVANT SHARED LARGELY IN HIS MASTER'S SCORN OF THE CHILD THOUGH HE
WAS COMPELLED TO RETAIN THE SENTIMENT IN HIS HEART BECAUSE HEATHCLIFF
PLAINLY MEANT HIS UNDERLINGS TO HOLD HIM IN HONOUR
'CANNOT ATE IT REPEATED HE PEERING IN LINTON'S FACE AND SUBDUING HIS
VOICE TO A WHISPER FOR FEAR OF BEING OVERHEARD
'BUT MAISTER HARETON
NIVIR ATE NAUGHT ELSE WHEN HE WER A LITTLE 'UN AND WHAT WER GOOID
ENOUGH FOR HIM'S GOOID ENOUGH FOR YE I'S RAYTHER THINK
'I SHA'N'T EAT IT ANSWERED LINTON SNAPPISHLY
'TAKE IT AWAY
JOSEPH SNATCHED UP THE FOOD INDIGNANTLY AND BROUGHT IT TO US
'IS THERE AUGHT AILS TH' VICTUALS HE ASKED THRUSTING THE TRAY UNDER
HEATHCLIFF'S NOSE
'WHAT SHOULD AIL THEM HE SAID
'WAH ANSWERED JOSEPH 'YON DAINTY CHAP SAYS HE CANNUT ATE 'EM
BUT I
GUESS IT'S RAIGHT HIS MOTHER WER JUST SOA WE WER A'MOST TOO MUCKY TO
SOW T' CORN FOR MAKKING HER BREEAD
'DON'T MENTION HIS MOTHER TO ME SAID THE MASTER ANGRILY
'GET HIM
SOMETHING THAT HE CAN EAT THAT'S ALL
WHAT IS HIS USUAL FOOD NELLY
I SUGGESTED BOILED MILK OR TEA AND THE HOUSEKEEPER RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS
TO PREPARE SOME
COME I REFLECTED HIS FATHER'S SELFISHNESS MAY
CONTRIBUTE TO HIS COMFORT
HE PERCEIVES HIS DELICATE CONSTITUTION AND
THE NECESSITY OF TREATING HIM TOLERABLY
I'LL CONSOLE MR
EDGAR BY
ACQUAINTING HIM WITH THE TURN HEATHCLIFF'S HUMOUR HAS TAKEN
HAVING NO
EXCUSE FOR LINGERING LONGER I SLIPPED OUT WHILE LINTON WAS ENGAGED IN
TIMIDLY REBUFFING THE ADVANCES OF A FRIENDLY SHEEP DOG
BUT HE WAS TOO
MUCH ON THE ALERT TO BE CHEATED AS I CLOSED THE DOOR I HEARD A CRY AND
A FRANTIC REPETITION OF THE WORDS
'DON'T LEAVE ME I'LL NOT STAY HERE I'LL NOT STAY HERE
THEN THE LATCH WAS RAISED AND FELL THEY DID NOT SUFFER HIM TO COME
FORTH
I MOUNTED MINNY AND URGED HER TO A TROT AND SO MY BRIEF
GUARDIANSHIP ENDED
CHAPTER XXI
WE HAD SAD WORK WITH LITTLE CATHY THAT DAY SHE ROSE IN HIGH GLEE EAGER
TO JOIN HER COUSIN AND SUCH PASSIONATE TEARS AND LAMENTATIONS FOLLOWED
THE NEWS OF HIS DEPARTURE THAT EDGAR HIMSELF WAS OBLIGED TO SOOTHE HER
BY AFFIRMING HE SHOULD COME BACK SOON HE ADDED HOWEVER 'IF I CAN GET
HIM' AND THERE WERE NO HOPES OF THAT
THIS PROMISE POORLY PACIFIED HER
BUT TIME WAS MORE POTENT AND THOUGH STILL AT INTERVALS SHE INQUIRED OF
HER FATHER WHEN LINTON WOULD RETURN BEFORE SHE DID SEE HIM AGAIN HIS
FEATURES HAD WAXED SO DIM IN HER MEMORY THAT SHE DID NOT RECOGNISE HIM
WHEN I CHANCED TO ENCOUNTER THE HOUSEKEEPER OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS IN
PAYING BUSINESS VISITS TO GIMMERTON I USED TO ASK HOW THE YOUNG MASTER
GOT ON FOR HE LIVED ALMOST AS SECLUDED AS CATHERINE HERSELF AND WAS
NEVER TO BE SEEN
I COULD GATHER FROM HER THAT HE CONTINUED IN WEAK
HEALTH AND WAS A TIRESOME INMATE
SHE SAID MR
HEATHCLIFF SEEMED TO
DISLIKE HIM EVER LONGER AND WORSE THOUGH HE TOOK SOME TROUBLE TO CONCEAL
IT HE HAD AN ANTIPATHY TO THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE AND COULD NOT DO AT
ALL WITH HIS SITTING IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM MANY MINUTES TOGETHER
THERE SELDOM PASSED MUCH TALK BETWEEN THEM LINTON LEARNT HIS LESSONS AND
SPENT HIS EVENINGS IN A SMALL APARTMENT THEY CALLED THE PARLOUR OR ELSE
LAY IN BED ALL DAY FOR HE WAS CONSTANTLY GETTING COUGHS AND COLDS AND
ACHES AND PAINS OF SOME SORT
'AND I NEVER KNOW SUCH A FAINTHEARTED CREATURE ADDED THE WOMAN 'NOR
ONE SO CAREFUL OF HISSELN
HE WILL GO ON IF I LEAVE THE WINDOW OPEN A
BIT LATE IN THE EVENING
OH IT'S KILLING A BREATH OF NIGHT AIR AND HE
MUST HAVE A FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER AND JOSEPH'S BACCA PIPE IS
POISON AND HE MUST ALWAYS HAVE SWEETS AND DAINTIES AND ALWAYS MILK
MILK FOR EVER HEEDING NAUGHT HOW THE REST OF US ARE PINCHED IN WINTER
AND THERE HE'LL SIT WRAPPED IN HIS FURRED CLOAK IN HIS CHAIR BY THE
FIRE WITH SOME TOAST AND WATER OR OTHER SLOP ON THE HOB TO SIP AT AND
IF HARETON FOR PITY COMES TO AMUSE HIM HARETON IS NOT BAD NATURED
THOUGH HE'S ROUGH THEY'RE SURE TO PART ONE SWEARING AND THE OTHER
CRYING
I BELIEVE THE MASTER WOULD RELISH EARNSHAW'S THRASHING HIM TO A
MUMMY IF HE WERE NOT HIS SON AND I'M CERTAIN HE WOULD BE FIT TO TURN
HIM OUT OF DOORS IF HE KNEW HALF THE NURSING HE GIVES HISSELN
BUT THEN
HE WON'T GO INTO DANGER OF TEMPTATION HE NEVER ENTERS THE PARLOUR AND
SHOULD LINTON SHOW THOSE WAYS IN THE HOUSE WHERE HE IS HE SENDS HIM
UP STAIRS DIRECTLY
I DIVINED FROM THIS ACCOUNT THAT UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY HAD RENDERED
YOUNG HEATHCLIFF SELFISH AND DISAGREEABLE IF HE WERE NOT SO ORIGINALLY
AND MY INTEREST IN HIM CONSEQUENTLY DECAYED THOUGH STILL I WAS MOVED
WITH A SENSE OF GRIEF AT HIS LOT AND A WISH THAT HE HAD BEEN LEFT WITH
US
MR
EDGAR ENCOURAGED ME TO GAIN INFORMATION HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL
ABOUT HIM I FANCY AND WOULD HAVE RUN SOME RISK TO SEE HIM AND HE TOLD
ME ONCE TO ASK THE HOUSEKEEPER WHETHER HE EVER CAME INTO THE VILLAGE SHE
SAID HE HAD ONLY BEEN TWICE ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANYING HIS FATHER AND
BOTH TIMES HE PRETENDED TO BE QUITE KNOCKED UP FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS
AFTERWARDS
THAT HOUSEKEEPER LEFT IF I RECOLLECT RIGHTLY TWO YEARS
AFTER HE CAME AND ANOTHER WHOM I DID NOT KNOW WAS HER SUCCESSOR SHE
LIVES THERE STILL
TIME WORE ON AT THE GRANGE IN ITS FORMER PLEASANT WAY TILL MISS CATHY
REACHED SIXTEEN
ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER BIRTH WE NEVER MANIFESTED ANY
SIGNS OF REJOICING BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO THE ANNIVERSARY OF MY LATE
MISTRESS'S DEATH
HER FATHER INVARIABLY SPENT THAT DAY ALONE IN THE
LIBRARY AND WALKED AT DUSK AS FAR AS GIMMERTON KIRKYARD WHERE HE
WOULD FREQUENTLY PROLONG HIS STAY BEYOND MIDNIGHT
THEREFORE CATHERINE
WAS THROWN ON HER OWN RESOURCES FOR AMUSEMENT
THIS TWENTIETH OF MARCH
WAS A BEAUTIFUL SPRING DAY AND WHEN HER FATHER HAD RETIRED MY YOUNG
LADY CAME DOWN DRESSED FOR GOING OUT AND SAID SHE ASKED TO HAVE A RAMBLE
ON THE EDGE OF THE MOOR WITH ME MR
LINTON HAD GIVEN HER LEAVE IF WE
WENT ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE AND WERE BACK WITHIN THE HOUR
'SO MAKE HASTE ELLEN SHE CRIED
'I KNOW WHERE I WISH TO GO WHERE A
COLONY OF MOOR GAME ARE SETTLED I WANT TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAVE MADE
THEIR NESTS YET
'THAT MUST BE A GOOD DISTANCE UP I ANSWERED 'THEY DON'T BREED ON THE
EDGE OF THE MOOR
'NO IT'S NOT SHE SAID
'I'VE GONE VERY NEAR WITH PAPA
I PUT ON MY BONNET AND SALLIED OUT THINKING NOTHING MORE OF THE MATTER
SHE BOUNDED BEFORE ME AND RETURNED TO MY SIDE AND WAS OFF AGAIN LIKE A
YOUNG GREYHOUND AND AT FIRST I FOUND PLENTY OF ENTERTAINMENT IN
LISTENING TO THE LARKS SINGING FAR AND NEAR AND ENJOYING THE SWEET WARM
SUNSHINE AND WATCHING HER MY PET AND MY DELIGHT WITH HER GOLDEN
RINGLETS FLYING LOOSE BEHIND AND HER BRIGHT CHEEK AS SOFT AND PURE IN
ITS BLOOM AS A WILD ROSE AND HER EYES RADIANT WITH CLOUDLESS PLEASURE
SHE WAS A HAPPY CREATURE AND AN ANGEL IN THOSE DAYS
IT'S A PITY SHE
COULD NOT BE CONTENT
'WELL SAID I 'WHERE ARE YOUR MOOR GAME MISS CATHY WE SHOULD BE AT
THEM THE GRANGE PARK FENCE IS A GREAT WAY OFF NOW
'OH A LITTLE FURTHER ONLY A LITTLE FURTHER ELLEN WAS HER ANSWER
CONTINUALLY
'CLIMB TO THAT HILLOCK PASS THAT BANK AND BY THE TIME YOU
REACH THE OTHER SIDE I SHALL HAVE RAISED THE BIRDS
BUT THERE WERE SO MANY HILLOCKS AND BANKS TO CLIMB AND PASS THAT AT
LENGTH I BEGAN TO BE WEARY AND TOLD HER WE MUST HALT AND RETRACE OUR
STEPS
I SHOUTED TO HER AS SHE HAD OUTSTRIPPED ME A LONG WAY SHE
EITHER DID NOT HEAR OR DID NOT REGARD FOR SHE STILL SPRANG ON AND I WAS
COMPELLED TO FOLLOW
FINALLY SHE DIVED INTO A HOLLOW AND BEFORE I CAME
IN SIGHT OF HER AGAIN SHE WAS TWO MILES NEARER WUTHERING HEIGHTS THAN
HER OWN HOME AND I BEHELD A COUPLE OF PERSONS ARREST HER ONE OF WHOM I
FELT CONVINCED WAS MR
HEATHCLIFF HIMSELF
CATHY HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN THE FACT OF PLUNDERING OR AT LEAST HUNTING
OUT THE NESTS OF THE GROUSE
THE HEIGHTS WERE HEATHCLIFF'S LAND AND HE
WAS REPROVING THE POACHER
'I'VE NEITHER TAKEN ANY NOR FOUND ANY SHE SAID AS I TOILED TO THEM
EXPANDING HER HANDS IN CORROBORATION OF THE STATEMENT
'I DIDN'T MEAN TO
TAKE THEM BUT PAPA TOLD ME THERE WERE QUANTITIES UP HERE AND I WISHED
TO SEE THE EGGS
HEATHCLIFF GLANCED AT ME WITH AN ILL MEANING SMILE EXPRESSING HIS
ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PARTY AND CONSEQUENTLY HIS MALEVOLENCE TOWARDS
IT AND DEMANDED WHO 'PAPA' WAS
'MR
LINTON OF THRUSHCROSS GRANGE SHE REPLIED
'I THOUGHT YOU DID NOT
KNOW ME OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SPOKEN IN THAT WAY
'YOU SUPPOSE PAPA IS HIGHLY ESTEEMED AND RESPECTED THEN HE SAID
SARCASTICALLY
'AND WHAT ARE YOU INQUIRED CATHERINE GAZING CURIOUSLY ON THE SPEAKER
'THAT MAN I'VE SEEN BEFORE
IS HE YOUR SON
SHE POINTED TO HARETON THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD GAINED NOTHING BUT
INCREASED BULK AND STRENGTH BY THE ADDITION OF TWO YEARS TO HIS AGE HE
SEEMED AS AWKWARD AND ROUGH AS EVER
'MISS CATHY I INTERRUPTED 'IT WILL BE THREE HOURS INSTEAD OF ONE THAT
WE ARE OUT PRESENTLY
WE REALLY MUST GO BACK
'NO THAT MAN IS NOT MY SON ANSWERED HEATHCLIFF PUSHING ME ASIDE
'BUT
I HAVE ONE AND YOU HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE TOO AND THOUGH YOUR NURSE IS
IN A HURRY I THINK BOTH YOU AND SHE WOULD BE THE BETTER FOR A LITTLE
REST
WILL YOU JUST TURN THIS NAB OF HEATH AND WALK INTO MY HOUSE
YOU'LL GET HOME EARLIER FOR THE EASE AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE A KIND
WELCOME
I WHISPERED CATHERINE THAT SHE MUSTN'T ON ANY ACCOUNT ACCEDE TO THE
PROPOSAL IT WAS ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION
'WHY SHE ASKED ALOUD
'I'M TIRED OF RUNNING AND THE GROUND IS DEWY
I CAN'T SIT HERE
LET US GO ELLEN
BESIDES HE SAYS I HAVE SEEN HIS
SON
HE'S MISTAKEN I THINK BUT I GUESS WHERE HE LIVES AT THE
FARMHOUSE I VISITED IN COMING FROM PENISTONE CRAGS
DON'T YOU
'I DO
COME NELLY HOLD YOUR TONGUE IT WILL BE A TREAT FOR HER TO LOOK
IN ON US
HARETON GET FORWARDS WITH THE LASS
YOU SHALL WALK WITH ME
NELLY
'NO SHE'S NOT GOING TO ANY SUCH PLACE I CRIED STRUGGLING TO RELEASE
MY ARM WHICH HE HAD SEIZED BUT SHE WAS ALMOST AT THE DOOR STONES
ALREADY SCAMPERING ROUND THE BROW AT FULL SPEED
HER APPOINTED
COMPANION DID NOT PRETEND TO ESCORT HER HE SHIED OFF BY THE ROAD SIDE
AND VANISHED
'MR
HEATHCLIFF IT'S VERY WRONG I CONTINUED 'YOU KNOW YOU MEAN NO
GOOD
AND THERE SHE'LL SEE LINTON AND ALL WILL BE TOLD AS SOON AS EVER
WE RETURN AND I SHALL HAVE THE BLAME
'I WANT HER TO SEE LINTON HE ANSWERED 'HE'S LOOKING BETTER THESE FEW
DAYS IT'S NOT OFTEN HE'S FIT TO BE SEEN
AND WE'LL SOON PERSUADE HER TO
KEEP THE VISIT SECRET WHERE IS THE HARM OF IT
'THE HARM OF IT IS THAT HER FATHER WOULD HATE ME IF HE FOUND I SUFFERED
HER TO ENTER YOUR HOUSE AND I AM CONVINCED YOU HAVE A BAD DESIGN IN
ENCOURAGING HER TO DO SO I REPLIED
'MY DESIGN IS AS HONEST AS POSSIBLE
I'LL INFORM YOU OF ITS WHOLE
SCOPE HE SAID
'THAT THE TWO COUSINS MAY FALL IN LOVE AND GET
MARRIED
I'M ACTING GENEROUSLY TO YOUR MASTER HIS YOUNG CHIT HAS NO
EXPECTATIONS AND SHOULD SHE SECOND MY WISHES SHE'LL BE PROVIDED FOR AT
ONCE AS JOINT SUCCESSOR WITH LINTON
'IF LINTON DIED I ANSWERED 'AND HIS LIFE IS QUITE UNCERTAIN CATHERINE
WOULD BE THE HEIR
'NO SHE WOULD NOT HE SAID
'THERE IS NO CLAUSE IN THE WILL TO SECURE
IT SO HIS PROPERTY WOULD GO TO ME BUT TO PREVENT DISPUTES I DESIRE
THEIR UNION AND AM RESOLVED TO BRING IT ABOUT
'AND I'M RESOLVED SHE SHALL NEVER APPROACH YOUR HOUSE WITH ME AGAIN I
RETURNED AS WE REACHED THE GATE WHERE MISS CATHY WAITED OUR COMING
HEATHCLIFF BADE ME BE QUIET AND PRECEDING US UP THE PATH HASTENED TO
OPEN THE DOOR
MY YOUNG LADY GAVE HIM SEVERAL LOOKS AS IF SHE COULD NOT
EXACTLY MAKE UP HER MIND WHAT TO THINK OF HIM BUT NOW HE SMILED WHEN HE
MET HER EYE AND SOFTENED HIS VOICE IN ADDRESSING HER AND I WAS FOOLISH
ENOUGH TO IMAGINE THE MEMORY OF HER MOTHER MIGHT DISARM HIM FROM DESIRING
HER INJURY
LINTON STOOD ON THE HEARTH
HE HAD BEEN OUT WALKING IN THE
FIELDS FOR HIS CAP WAS ON AND HE WAS CALLING TO JOSEPH TO BRING HIM DRY
SHOES
HE HAD GROWN TALL OF HIS AGE STILL WANTING SOME MONTHS OF
SIXTEEN
HIS FEATURES WERE PRETTY YET AND HIS EYE AND COMPLEXION
BRIGHTER THAN I REMEMBERED THEM THOUGH WITH MERELY TEMPORARY LUSTRE
BORROWED FROM THE SALUBRIOUS AIR AND GENIAL SUN
'NOW WHO IS THAT ASKED MR
HEATHCLIFF TURNING TO CATHY
'CAN YOU
TELL
'YOUR SON SHE SAID HAVING DOUBTFULLY SURVEYED FIRST ONE AND THEN THE
OTHER
'YES YES ANSWERED HE 'BUT IS THIS THE ONLY TIME YOU HAVE BEHELD HIM
THINK AH YOU HAVE A SHORT MEMORY
LINTON DON'T YOU RECALL YOUR
COUSIN THAT YOU USED TO TEASE US SO WITH WISHING TO SEE
'WHAT LINTON CRIED CATHY KINDLING INTO JOYFUL SURPRISE AT THE NAME
'IS THAT LITTLE LINTON HE'S TALLER THAN I AM ARE YOU LINTON
THE YOUTH STEPPED FORWARD AND ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF SHE KISSED HIM
FERVENTLY AND THEY GAZED WITH WONDER AT THE CHANGE TIME HAD WROUGHT IN
THE APPEARANCE OF EACH
CATHERINE HAD REACHED HER FULL HEIGHT HER
FIGURE WAS BOTH PLUMP AND SLENDER ELASTIC AS STEEL AND HER WHOLE ASPECT
SPARKLING WITH HEALTH AND SPIRITS
LINTON'S LOOKS AND MOVEMENTS WERE
VERY LANGUID AND HIS FORM EXTREMELY SLIGHT BUT THERE WAS A GRACE IN HIS
MANNER THAT MITIGATED THESE DEFECTS AND RENDERED HIM NOT UNPLEASING
AFTER EXCHANGING NUMEROUS MARKS OF FONDNESS WITH HIM HIS COUSIN WENT TO
MR
HEATHCLIFF WHO LINGERED BY THE DOOR DIVIDING HIS ATTENTION BETWEEN
THE OBJECTS INSIDE AND THOSE THAT LAY WITHOUT PRETENDING THAT IS TO
OBSERVE THE LATTER AND REALLY NOTING THE FORMER ALONE
'AND YOU ARE MY UNCLE THEN SHE CRIED REACHING UP TO SALUTE HIM
'I
THOUGHT I LIKED YOU THOUGH YOU WERE CROSS AT FIRST
WHY DON'T YOU VISIT
AT THE GRANGE WITH LINTON TO LIVE ALL THESE YEARS SUCH CLOSE
NEIGHBOURS AND NEVER SEE US IS ODD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE SO FOR
'I VISITED IT ONCE OR TWICE TOO OFTEN BEFORE YOU WERE BORN HE ANSWERED
'THERE DAMN IT IF YOU HAVE ANY KISSES TO SPARE GIVE THEM TO LINTON
THEY ARE THROWN AWAY ON ME
'NAUGHTY ELLEN EXCLAIMED CATHERINE FLYING TO ATTACK ME NEXT WITH HER
LAVISH CARESSES
'WICKED ELLEN TO TRY TO HINDER ME FROM ENTERING
BUT
I'LL TAKE THIS WALK EVERY MORNING IN FUTURE MAY I UNCLE AND SOMETIMES
BRING PAPA
WON'T YOU BE GLAD TO SEE US
'OF COURSE REPLIED THE UNCLE WITH A HARDLY SUPPRESSED GRIMACE
RESULTING FROM HIS DEEP AVERSION TO BOTH THE PROPOSED VISITORS
'BUT
STAY HE CONTINUED TURNING TOWARDS THE YOUNG LADY
'NOW I THINK OF IT
I'D BETTER TELL YOU
MR
LINTON HAS A PREJUDICE AGAINST ME WE
QUARRELLED AT ONE TIME OF OUR LIVES WITH UNCHRISTIAN FEROCITY AND IF
YOU MENTION COMING HERE TO HIM HE'LL PUT A VETO ON YOUR VISITS
ALTOGETHER
THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT MENTION IT UNLESS YOU BE CARELESS
OF SEEING YOUR COUSIN HEREAFTER YOU MAY COME IF YOU WILL BUT YOU MUST
NOT MENTION IT
'WHY DID YOU QUARREL ASKED CATHERINE CONSIDERABLY CRESTFALLEN
'HE THOUGHT ME TOO POOR TO WED HIS SISTER ANSWERED HEATHCLIFF 'AND WAS
GRIEVED THAT I GOT HER HIS PRIDE WAS HURT AND HE'LL NEVER FORGIVE IT
'THAT'S WRONG SAID THE YOUNG LADY 'SOME TIME I'LL TELL HIM SO
BUT
LINTON AND I HAVE NO SHARE IN YOUR QUARREL
I'LL NOT COME HERE THEN HE
SHALL COME TO THE GRANGE
'IT WILL BE TOO FAR FOR ME MURMURED HER COUSIN 'TO WALK FOUR MILES
WOULD KILL ME
NO COME HERE MISS CATHERINE NOW AND THEN NOT EVERY
MORNING BUT ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK
THE FATHER LAUNCHED TOWARDS HIS SON A GLANCE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
'I AM AFRAID NELLY I SHALL LOSE MY LABOUR HE MUTTERED TO ME
'MISS
CATHERINE AS THE NINNY CALLS HER WILL DISCOVER HIS VALUE AND SEND HIM
TO THE DEVIL
NOW IF IT HAD BEEN HARETON DO YOU KNOW THAT TWENTY
TIMES A DAY I COVET HARETON WITH ALL HIS DEGRADATION I'D HAVE LOVED
THE LAD HAD HE BEEN SOME ONE ELSE
BUT I THINK HE'S SAFE FROM HER
LOVE
I'LL PIT HIM AGAINST THAT PALTRY CREATURE UNLESS IT BESTIR ITSELF
BRISKLY
WE CALCULATE IT WILL SCARCELY LAST TILL IT IS EIGHTEEN
OH
CONFOUND THE VAPID THING HE'S ABSORBED IN DRYING HIS FEET AND NEVER
LOOKS AT HER LINTON
'YES FATHER ANSWERED THE BOY
'HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SHOW YOUR COUSIN ANYWHERE ABOUT NOT EVEN A RABBIT
OR A WEASEL'S NEST TAKE HER INTO THE GARDEN BEFORE YOU CHANGE YOUR
SHOES AND INTO THE STABLE TO SEE YOUR HORSE
'WOULDN'T YOU RATHER SIT HERE ASKED LINTON ADDRESSING CATHY IN A TONE
WHICH EXPRESSED RELUCTANCE TO MOVE AGAIN
'I DON'T KNOW SHE REPLIED CASTING A LONGING LOOK TO THE DOOR AND
EVIDENTLY EAGER TO BE ACTIVE
HE KEPT HIS SEAT AND SHRANK CLOSER TO THE FIRE
HEATHCLIFF ROSE AND
WENT INTO THE KITCHEN AND FROM THENCE TO THE YARD CALLING OUT FOR
HARETON
HARETON RESPONDED AND PRESENTLY THE TWO RE ENTERED
THE YOUNG
MAN HAD BEEN WASHING HIMSELF AS WAS VISIBLE BY THE GLOW ON HIS CHEEKS
AND HIS WETTED HAIR
'OH I'LL ASK YOU UNCLE CRIED MISS CATHY RECOLLECTING THE
HOUSEKEEPER'S ASSERTION
'THAT IS NOT MY COUSIN IS HE
'YES HE REPLIED 'YOUR MOTHER'S NEPHEW
DON'T YOU LIKE HIM
CATHERINE LOOKED QUEER
'IS HE NOT A HANDSOME LAD HE CONTINUED
THE UNCIVIL LITTLE THING STOOD ON TIPTOE AND WHISPERED A SENTENCE IN
HEATHCLIFF'S EAR
HE LAUGHED HARETON DARKENED I PERCEIVED HE WAS VERY
SENSITIVE TO SUSPECTED SLIGHTS AND HAD OBVIOUSLY A DIM NOTION OF HIS
INFERIORITY
BUT HIS MASTER OR GUARDIAN CHASED THE FROWN BY EXCLAIMING
'YOU'LL BE THE FAVOURITE AMONG US HARETON SHE SAYS YOU ARE A WHAT WAS
IT WELL SOMETHING VERY FLATTERING
HERE YOU GO WITH HER ROUND THE
FARM
AND BEHAVE LIKE A GENTLEMAN MIND DON'T USE ANY BAD WORDS AND
DON'T STARE WHEN THE YOUNG LADY IS NOT LOOKING AT YOU AND BE READY TO
HIDE YOUR FACE WHEN SHE IS AND WHEN YOU SPEAK SAY YOUR WORDS SLOWLY
AND KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR POCKETS
BE OFF AND ENTERTAIN HER AS
NICELY AS YOU CAN
HE WATCHED THE COUPLE WALKING PAST THE WINDOW
EARNSHAW HAD HIS
COUNTENANCE COMPLETELY AVERTED FROM HIS COMPANION
HE SEEMED STUDYING
THE FAMILIAR LANDSCAPE WITH A STRANGER'S AND AN ARTIST'S INTEREST
CATHERINE TOOK A SLY LOOK AT HIM EXPRESSING SMALL ADMIRATION
SHE THEN
TURNED HER ATTENTION TO SEEKING OUT OBJECTS OF AMUSEMENT FOR HERSELF AND
TRIPPED MERRILY ON LILTING A TUNE TO SUPPLY THE LACK OF CONVERSATION
'I'VE TIED HIS TONGUE OBSERVED HEATHCLIFF
'HE'LL NOT VENTURE A SINGLE
SYLLABLE ALL THE TIME NELLY YOU RECOLLECT ME AT HIS AGE NAY SOME
YEARS YOUNGER
DID I EVER LOOK SO STUPID SO GAUMLESS AS JOSEPH CALLS
IT
'WORSE I REPLIED 'BECAUSE MORE SULLEN WITH IT
'I'VE A PLEASURE IN HIM HE CONTINUED REFLECTING ALOUD
'HE HAS
SATISFIED MY EXPECTATIONS
IF HE WERE A BORN FOOL I SHOULD NOT ENJOY IT
HALF SO MUCH
BUT HE'S NO FOOL AND I CAN SYMPATHISE WITH ALL HIS
FEELINGS HAVING FELT THEM MYSELF
I KNOW WHAT HE SUFFERS NOW FOR
INSTANCE EXACTLY IT IS MERELY A BEGINNING OF WHAT HE SHALL SUFFER
THOUGH
AND HE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO EMERGE FROM HIS BATHOS OF COARSENESS
AND IGNORANCE
I'VE GOT HIM FASTER THAN HIS SCOUNDREL OF A FATHER
SECURED ME AND LOWER FOR HE TAKES A PRIDE IN HIS BRUTISHNESS
I'VE
TAUGHT HIM TO SCORN EVERYTHING EXTRA ANIMAL AS SILLY AND WEAK
DON'T YOU
THINK HINDLEY WOULD BE PROUD OF HIS SON IF HE COULD SEE HIM ALMOST AS
PROUD AS I AM OF MINE
BUT THERE'S THIS DIFFERENCE ONE IS GOLD PUT TO
THE USE OF PAVING STONES AND THE OTHER IS TIN POLISHED TO APE A SERVICE
OF SILVER
MINE HAS NOTHING VALUABLE ABOUT IT YET I SHALL HAVE THE
MERIT OF MAKING IT GO AS FAR AS SUCH POOR STUFF CAN GO
HIS HAD
FIRST RATE QUALITIES AND THEY ARE LOST RENDERED WORSE THAN UNAVAILING
I HAVE NOTHING TO REGRET HE WOULD HAVE MORE THAN ANY BUT I ARE AWARE
OF
AND THE BEST OF IT IS HARETON IS DAMNABLY FOND OF ME YOU'LL OWN
THAT I'VE OUTMATCHED HINDLEY THERE
IF THE DEAD VILLAIN COULD RISE FROM
HIS GRAVE TO ABUSE ME FOR HIS OFFSPRING'S WRONGS I SHOULD HAVE THE FUN
OF SEEING THE SAID OFFSPRING FIGHT HIM BACK AGAIN INDIGNANT THAT HE
SHOULD DARE TO RAIL AT THE ONE FRIEND HE HAS IN THE WORLD
HEATHCLIFF CHUCKLED A FIENDISH LAUGH AT THE IDEA
I MADE NO REPLY
BECAUSE I SAW THAT HE EXPECTED NONE
MEANTIME OUR YOUNG COMPANION WHO
SAT TOO REMOVED FROM US TO HEAR WHAT WAS SAID BEGAN TO EVINCE SYMPTOMS
OF UNEASINESS PROBABLY REPENTING THAT HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE TREAT OF
CATHERINE'S SOCIETY FOR FEAR OF A LITTLE FATIGUE
HIS FATHER REMARKED
THE RESTLESS GLANCES WANDERING TO THE WINDOW AND THE HAND IRRESOLUTELY
EXTENDED TOWARDS HIS CAP
'GET UP YOU IDLE BOY HE EXCLAIMED WITH ASSUMED HEARTINESS
'AWAY AFTER THEM THEY ARE JUST AT THE CORNER BY THE STAND OF HIVES
LINTON GATHERED HIS ENERGIES AND LEFT THE HEARTH
THE LATTICE WAS OPEN
AND AS HE STEPPED OUT I HEARD CATHY INQUIRING OF HER UNSOCIABLE
ATTENDANT WHAT WAS THAT INSCRIPTION OVER THE DOOR HARETON STARED UP AND
SCRATCHED HIS HEAD LIKE A TRUE CLOWN
'IT'S SOME DAMNABLE WRITING HE ANSWERED
'I CANNOT READ IT
'CAN'T READ IT CRIED CATHERINE 'I CAN READ IT IT'S ENGLISH
BUT I
WANT TO KNOW WHY IT IS THERE
LINTON GIGGLED THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF MIRTH HE HAD EXHIBITED
'HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS LETTERS HE SAID TO HIS COUSIN
'COULD YOU
BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A COLOSSAL DUNCE
'IS HE ALL AS HE SHOULD BE ASKED MISS CATHY SERIOUSLY 'OR IS HE
SIMPLE NOT RIGHT I'VE QUESTIONED HIM TWICE NOW AND EACH TIME HE
LOOKED SO STUPID I THINK HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ME
I CAN HARDLY
UNDERSTAND HIM I'M SURE
LINTON REPEATED HIS LAUGH AND GLANCED AT HARETON TAUNTINGLY WHO
CERTAINLY DID NOT SEEM QUITE CLEAR OF COMPREHENSION AT THAT MOMENT
'THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER BUT LAZINESS IS THERE EARNSHAW HE SAID
'MY COUSIN FANCIES YOU ARE AN IDIOT
THERE YOU EXPERIENCE THE
CONSEQUENCE OF SCORNING BOOK LARNING AS YOU WOULD SAY
HAVE YOU
NOTICED CATHERINE HIS FRIGHTFUL YORKSHIRE PRONUNCIATION
'WHY WHERE THE DEVIL IS THE USE ON'T GROWLED HARETON MORE READY IN
ANSWERING HIS DAILY COMPANION
HE WAS ABOUT TO ENLARGE FURTHER BUT THE
TWO YOUNGSTERS BROKE INTO A NOISY FIT OF MERRIMENT MY GIDDY MISS BEING
DELIGHTED TO DISCOVER THAT SHE MIGHT TURN HIS STRANGE TALK TO MATTER OF
AMUSEMENT
'WHERE IS THE USE OF THE DEVIL IN THAT SENTENCE TITTERED LINTON
'PAPA
TOLD YOU NOT TO SAY ANY BAD WORDS AND YOU CAN'T OPEN YOUR MOUTH WITHOUT
ONE
DO TRY TO BEHAVE LIKE A GENTLEMAN NOW DO
'IF THOU WEREN'T MORE A LASS THAN A LAD I'D FELL THEE THIS MINUTE I
WOULD PITIFUL LATH OF A CRATER RETORTED THE ANGRY BOOR RETREATING
WHILE HIS FACE BURNT WITH MINGLED RAGE AND MORTIFICATION FOR HE WAS
CONSCIOUS OF BEING INSULTED AND EMBARRASSED HOW TO RESENT IT
MR
HEATHCLIFF HAVING OVERHEARD THE CONVERSATION AS WELL AS I SMILED
WHEN HE SAW HIM GO BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS CAST A LOOK OF SINGULAR
AVERSION ON THE FLIPPANT PAIR WHO REMAINED CHATTERING IN THE DOOR WAY
THE BOY FINDING ANIMATION ENOUGH WHILE DISCUSSING HARETON'S FAULTS AND
DEFICIENCIES AND RELATING ANECDOTES OF HIS GOINGS ON AND THE GIRL
RELISHING HIS PERT AND SPITEFUL SAYINGS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE
ILL NATURE THEY EVINCED
I BEGAN TO DISLIKE MORE THAN TO COMPASSIONATE
LINTON AND TO EXCUSE HIS FATHER IN SOME MEASURE FOR HOLDING HIM CHEAP
WE STAYED TILL AFTERNOON I COULD NOT TEAR MISS CATHY AWAY SOONER BUT
HAPPILY MY MASTER HAD NOT QUITTED HIS APARTMENT AND REMAINED IGNORANT OF
OUR PROLONGED ABSENCE
AS WE WALKED HOME I WOULD FAIN HAVE ENLIGHTENED
MY CHARGE ON THE CHARACTERS OF THE PEOPLE WE HAD QUITTED BUT SHE GOT IT
INTO HER HEAD THAT I WAS PREJUDICED AGAINST THEM
'AHA SHE CRIED 'YOU TAKE PAPA'S SIDE ELLEN YOU ARE PARTIAL I KNOW
OR ELSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE CHEATED ME SO MANY YEARS INTO THE NOTION THAT
LINTON LIVED A LONG WAY FROM HERE
I'M REALLY EXTREMELY ANGRY ONLY I'M
SO PLEASED I CAN'T SHOW IT BUT YOU MUST HOLD YOUR TONGUE ABOUT MY
UNCLE HE'S MY UNCLE REMEMBER AND I'LL SCOLD PAPA FOR QUARRELLING WITH
HIM
AND SO SHE RAN ON TILL I RELINQUISHED THE ENDEAVOUR TO CONVINCE HER OF
HER MISTAKE
SHE DID NOT MENTION THE VISIT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE SHE DID
NOT SEE MR
LINTON
NEXT DAY IT ALL CAME OUT SADLY TO MY CHAGRIN AND
STILL I WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SORRY I THOUGHT THE BURDEN OF DIRECTING AND
WARNING WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENTLY BORNE BY HIM THAN ME
BUT HE WAS TOO
TIMID IN GIVING SATISFACTORY REASONS FOR HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD SHUN
CONNECTION WITH THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE HEIGHTS AND CATHERINE LIKED GOOD
REASONS FOR EVERY RESTRAINT THAT HARASSED HER PETTED WILL
'PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED AFTER THE MORNING'S SALUTATIONS 'GUESS WHOM I SAW
YESTERDAY IN MY WALK ON THE MOORS
AH PAPA YOU STARTED YOU'VE NOT
DONE RIGHT HAVE YOU NOW I SAW BUT LISTEN AND YOU SHALL HEAR HOW I
FOUND YOU OUT AND ELLEN WHO IS IN LEAGUE WITH YOU AND YET PRETENDED TO
PITY ME SO WHEN I KEPT HOPING AND WAS ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED ABOUT
LINTON'S COMING BACK
SHE GAVE A FAITHFUL ACCOUNT OF HER EXCURSION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES AND MY
MASTER THOUGH HE CAST MORE THAN ONE REPROACHFUL LOOK AT ME SAID NOTHING
TILL SHE HAD CONCLUDED
THEN HE DREW HER TO HIM AND ASKED IF SHE KNEW
WHY HE HAD CONCEALED LINTON'S NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD FROM HER COULD SHE
THINK IT WAS TO DENY HER A PLEASURE THAT SHE MIGHT HARMLESSLY ENJOY
'IT WAS BECAUSE YOU DISLIKED MR
HEATHCLIFF SHE ANSWERED
'THEN YOU BELIEVE I CARE MORE FOR MY OWN FEELINGS THAN YOURS CATHY HE
SAID
'NO IT WAS NOT BECAUSE I DISLIKED MR
HEATHCLIFF BUT BECAUSE MR
HEATHCLIFF DISLIKES ME AND IS A MOST DIABOLICAL MAN DELIGHTING TO WRONG
AND RUIN THOSE HE HATES IF THEY GIVE HIM THE SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY
I
KNEW THAT YOU COULD NOT KEEP UP AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOUR COUSIN WITHOUT
BEING BROUGHT INTO CONTACT WITH HIM AND I KNEW HE WOULD DETEST YOU ON MY
ACCOUNT SO FOR YOUR OWN GOOD AND NOTHING ELSE I TOOK PRECAUTIONS THAT
YOU SHOULD NOT SEE LINTON AGAIN
I MEANT TO EXPLAIN THIS SOME TIME AS
YOU GREW OLDER AND I'M SORRY I DELAYED IT
'BUT MR
HEATHCLIFF WAS QUITE CORDIAL PAPA OBSERVED CATHERINE NOT AT
ALL CONVINCED 'AND HE DIDN'T OBJECT TO OUR SEEING EACH OTHER HE SAID I
MIGHT COME TO HIS HOUSE WHEN I PLEASED ONLY I MUST NOT TELL YOU BECAUSE
YOU HAD QUARRELLED WITH HIM AND WOULD NOT FORGIVE HIM FOR MARRYING AUNT
ISABELLA
AND YOU WON'T
YOU ARE THE ONE TO BE BLAMED HE IS WILLING
TO LET US BE FRIENDS AT LEAST LINTON AND I AND YOU ARE NOT
MY MASTER PERCEIVING THAT SHE WOULD NOT TAKE HIS WORD FOR HER
UNCLE IN LAW'S EVIL DISPOSITION GAVE A HASTY SKETCH OF HIS CONDUCT TO
ISABELLA AND THE MANNER IN WHICH WUTHERING HEIGHTS BECAME HIS PROPERTY
HE COULD NOT BEAR TO DISCOURSE LONG UPON THE TOPIC FOR THOUGH HE SPOKE
LITTLE OF IT HE STILL FELT THE SAME HORROR AND DETESTATION OF HIS
ANCIENT ENEMY THAT HAD OCCUPIED HIS HEART EVER SINCE MRS
LINTON'S
DEATH
'SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIVING YET IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIM WAS
HIS CONSTANT BITTER REFLECTION AND IN HIS EYES HEATHCLIFF SEEMED A
MURDERER
MISS CATHY CONVERSANT WITH NO BAD DEEDS EXCEPT HER OWN SLIGHT
ACTS OF DISOBEDIENCE INJUSTICE AND PASSION ARISING FROM HOT TEMPER
AND THOUGHTLESSNESS AND REPENTED OF ON THE DAY THEY WERE COMMITTED WAS
AMAZED AT THE BLACKNESS OF SPIRIT THAT COULD BROOD ON AND COVER REVENGE
FOR YEARS AND DELIBERATELY PROSECUTE ITS PLANS WITHOUT A VISITATION OF
REMORSE
SHE APPEARED SO DEEPLY IMPRESSED AND SHOCKED AT THIS NEW VIEW
OF HUMAN NATURE EXCLUDED FROM ALL HER STUDIES AND ALL HER IDEAS TILL
NOW THAT MR
EDGAR DEEMED IT UNNECESSARY TO PURSUE THE SUBJECT
HE
MERELY ADDED 'YOU WILL KNOW HEREAFTER DARLING WHY I WISH YOU TO AVOID
HIS HOUSE AND FAMILY NOW RETURN TO YOUR OLD EMPLOYMENTS AND AMUSEMENTS
AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT THEM
CATHERINE KISSED HER FATHER AND SAT DOWN QUIETLY TO HER LESSONS FOR A
COUPLE OF HOURS ACCORDING TO CUSTOM THEN SHE ACCOMPANIED HIM INTO THE
GROUNDS AND THE WHOLE DAY PASSED AS USUAL BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE
HAD RETIRED TO HER ROOM AND I WENT TO HELP HER TO UNDRESS I FOUND HER
CRYING ON HER KNEES BY THE BEDSIDE
'OH FIE SILLY CHILD I EXCLAIMED
'IF YOU HAD ANY REAL GRIEFS YOU'D
BE ASHAMED TO WASTE A TEAR ON THIS LITTLE CONTRARIETY
YOU NEVER HAD ONE
SHADOW OF SUBSTANTIAL SORROW MISS CATHERINE
SUPPOSE FOR A MINUTE
THAT MASTER AND I WERE DEAD AND YOU WERE BY YOURSELF IN THE WORLD HOW
WOULD YOU FEEL THEN COMPARE THE PRESENT OCCASION WITH SUCH AN
AFFLICTION AS THAT AND BE THANKFUL FOR THE FRIENDS YOU HAVE INSTEAD OF
COVETING MORE
'I'M NOT CRYING FOR MYSELF ELLEN SHE ANSWERED 'IT'S FOR HIM
HE
EXPECTED TO SEE ME AGAIN TO MORROW AND THERE HE'LL BE SO DISAPPOINTED
AND HE'LL WAIT FOR ME AND I SHA'N'T COME
'NONSENSE SAID I 'DO YOU IMAGINE HE HAS THOUGHT AS MUCH OF YOU AS YOU
HAVE OF HIM HASN'T HE HARETON FOR A COMPANION NOT ONE IN A HUNDRED
WOULD WEEP AT LOSING A RELATION THEY HAD JUST SEEN TWICE FOR TWO
AFTERNOONS
LINTON WILL CONJECTURE HOW IT IS AND TROUBLE HIMSELF NO
FURTHER ABOUT YOU
'BUT MAY I NOT WRITE A NOTE TO TELL HIM WHY I CANNOT COME SHE ASKED
RISING TO HER FEET
'AND JUST SEND THOSE BOOKS I PROMISED TO LEND HIM
HIS BOOKS ARE NOT AS NICE AS MINE AND HE WANTED TO HAVE THEM EXTREMELY
WHEN I TOLD HIM HOW INTERESTING THEY WERE
MAY I NOT ELLEN
'NO INDEED NO INDEED REPLIED I WITH DECISION
'THEN HE WOULD WRITE
TO YOU AND THERE'D NEVER BE AN END OF IT
NO MISS CATHERINE THE
ACQUAINTANCE MUST BE DROPPED ENTIRELY SO PAPA EXPECTS AND I SHALL SEE
THAT IT IS DONE
'BUT HOW CAN ONE LITTLE NOTE SHE RECOMMENCED PUTTING ON AN IMPLORING
COUNTENANCE
'SILENCE I INTERRUPTED
'WE'LL NOT BEGIN WITH YOUR LITTLE NOTES
GET
INTO BED
SHE THREW AT ME A VERY NAUGHTY LOOK SO NAUGHTY THAT I WOULD NOT KISS HER
GOOD NIGHT AT FIRST I COVERED HER UP AND SHUT HER DOOR IN GREAT
DISPLEASURE BUT REPENTING HALF WAY I RETURNED SOFTLY AND LO THERE
WAS MISS STANDING AT THE TABLE WITH A BIT OF BLANK PAPER BEFORE HER AND A
PENCIL IN HER HAND WHICH SHE GUILTILY SLIPPED OUT OF SIGHT ON MY
ENTRANCE
'YOU'LL GET NOBODY TO TAKE THAT CATHERINE I SAID 'IF YOU WRITE IT
AND AT PRESENT I SHALL PUT OUT YOUR CANDLE
I SET THE EXTINGUISHER ON THE FLAME RECEIVING AS I DID SO A SLAP ON MY
HAND AND A PETULANT 'CROSS THING I THEN QUITTED HER AGAIN AND SHE
DREW THE BOLT IN ONE OF HER WORST MOST PEEVISH HUMOURS
THE LETTER WAS
FINISHED AND FORWARDED TO ITS DESTINATION BY A MILK FETCHER WHO CAME FROM
THE VILLAGE BUT THAT I DIDN'T LEARN TILL SOME TIME AFTERWARDS
WEEKS
PASSED ON AND CATHY RECOVERED HER TEMPER THOUGH SHE GREW WONDROUS FOND
OF STEALING OFF TO CORNERS BY HERSELF AND OFTEN IF I CAME NEAR HER
SUDDENLY WHILE READING SHE WOULD START AND BEND OVER THE BOOK EVIDENTLY
DESIROUS TO HIDE IT AND I DETECTED EDGES OF LOOSE PAPER STICKING OUT
BEYOND THE LEAVES
SHE ALSO GOT A TRICK OF COMING DOWN EARLY IN THE
MORNING AND LINGERING ABOUT THE KITCHEN AS IF SHE WERE EXPECTING THE
ARRIVAL OF SOMETHING AND SHE HAD A SMALL DRAWER IN A CABINET IN THE
LIBRARY WHICH SHE WOULD TRIFLE OVER FOR HOURS AND WHOSE KEY SHE TOOK
SPECIAL CARE TO REMOVE WHEN SHE LEFT IT
ONE DAY AS SHE INSPECTED THIS DRAWER I OBSERVED THAT THE PLAYTHINGS AND
TRINKETS WHICH RECENTLY FORMED ITS CONTENTS WERE TRANSMUTED INTO BITS OF
FOLDED PAPER
MY CURIOSITY AND SUSPICIONS WERE ROUSED I DETERMINED TO
TAKE A PEEP AT HER MYSTERIOUS TREASURES SO AT NIGHT AS SOON AS SHE AND
MY MASTER WERE SAFE UPSTAIRS I SEARCHED AND READILY FOUND AMONG MY
HOUSE KEYS ONE THAT WOULD FIT THE LOCK
HAVING OPENED I EMPTIED THE
WHOLE CONTENTS INTO MY APRON AND TOOK THEM WITH ME TO EXAMINE AT LEISURE
IN MY OWN CHAMBER
THOUGH I COULD NOT BUT SUSPECT I WAS STILL SURPRISED
TO DISCOVER THAT THEY WERE A MASS OF CORRESPONDENCE DAILY ALMOST IT
MUST HAVE BEEN FROM LINTON HEATHCLIFF ANSWERS TO DOCUMENTS FORWARDED BY
HER
THE EARLIER DATED WERE EMBARRASSED AND SHORT GRADUALLY HOWEVER
THEY EXPANDED INTO COPIOUS LOVE LETTERS FOOLISH AS THE AGE OF THE
WRITER RENDERED NATURAL YET WITH TOUCHES HERE AND THERE WHICH I THOUGHT
WERE BORROWED FROM A MORE EXPERIENCED SOURCE
SOME OF THEM STRUCK ME AS
SINGULARLY ODD COMPOUNDS OF ARDOUR AND FLATNESS COMMENCING IN STRONG
FEELING AND CONCLUDING IN THE AFFECTED WORDY STYLE THAT A SCHOOLBOY
MIGHT USE TO A FANCIED INCORPOREAL SWEETHEART
WHETHER THEY SATISFIED
CATHY I DON'T KNOW BUT THEY APPEARED VERY WORTHLESS TRASH TO ME
AFTER
TURNING OVER AS MANY AS I THOUGHT PROPER I TIED THEM IN A HANDKERCHIEF
AND SET THEM ASIDE RELOCKING THE VACANT DRAWER
FOLLOWING HER HABIT MY YOUNG LADY DESCENDED EARLY AND VISITED THE
KITCHEN I WATCHED HER GO TO THE DOOR ON THE ARRIVAL OF A CERTAIN LITTLE
BOY AND WHILE THE DAIRYMAID FILLED HIS CAN SHE TUCKED SOMETHING INTO
HIS JACKET POCKET AND PLUCKED SOMETHING OUT
I WENT ROUND BY THE
GARDEN AND LAID WAIT FOR THE MESSENGER WHO FOUGHT VALOROUSLY TO DEFEND
HIS TRUST AND WE SPILT THE MILK BETWEEN US BUT I SUCCEEDED IN
ABSTRACTING THE EPISTLE AND THREATENING SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IF HE DID
NOT LOOK SHARP HOME I REMAINED UNDER THE WALL AND PERUSED MISS CATHY'S
AFFECTIONATE COMPOSITION
IT WAS MORE SIMPLE AND MORE ELOQUENT THAN HER
COUSIN'S VERY PRETTY AND VERY SILLY
I SHOOK MY HEAD AND WENT
MEDITATING INTO THE HOUSE
THE DAY BEING WET SHE COULD NOT DIVERT
HERSELF WITH RAMBLING ABOUT THE PARK SO AT THE CONCLUSION OF HER
MORNING STUDIES SHE RESORTED TO THE SOLACE OF THE DRAWER
HER FATHER
SAT READING AT THE TABLE AND I ON PURPOSE HAD SOUGHT A BIT OF WORK IN
SOME UNRIPPED FRINGES OF THE WINDOW CURTAIN KEEPING MY EYE STEADILY
FIXED ON HER PROCEEDINGS
NEVER DID ANY BIRD FLYING BACK TO A PLUNDERED
NEST WHICH IT HAD LEFT BRIMFUL OF CHIRPING YOUNG ONES EXPRESS MORE
COMPLETE DESPAIR IN ITS ANGUISHED CRIES AND FLUTTERINGS THAN SHE BY HER
SINGLE 'OH AND THE CHANGE THAT TRANSFIGURED HER LATE HAPPY COUNTENANCE
MR
LINTON LOOKED UP
'WHAT IS THE MATTER LOVE HAVE YOU HURT YOURSELF HE SAID
HIS TONE AND LOOK ASSURED HER HE HAD NOT BEEN THE DISCOVERER OF THE
HOARD
'NO PAPA SHE GASPED
'ELLEN ELLEN COME UP STAIRS I'M SICK
I OBEYED HER SUMMONS AND ACCOMPANIED HER OUT
'OH ELLEN YOU HAVE GOT THEM SHE COMMENCED IMMEDIATELY DROPPING ON
HER KNEES WHEN WE WERE ENCLOSED ALONE
'OH GIVE THEM TO ME AND I'LL
NEVER NEVER DO SO AGAIN DON'T TELL PAPA
YOU HAVE NOT TOLD PAPA
ELLEN SAY YOU HAVE NOT I'VE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY NAUGHTY BUT I WON'T DO
IT ANY MORE
WITH A GRAVE SEVERITY IN MY MANNER I BADE HER STAND UP
'SO I EXCLAIMED 'MISS CATHERINE YOU ARE TOLERABLY FAR ON IT SEEMS
YOU MAY WELL BE ASHAMED OF THEM A FINE BUNDLE OF TRASH YOU STUDY IN
YOUR LEISURE HOURS TO BE SURE WHY IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO BE PRINTED AND
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MASTER WILL THINK WHEN I DISPLAY IT BEFORE HIM I
HAV'N'T SHOWN IT YET BUT YOU NEEDN'T IMAGINE I SHALL KEEP YOUR
RIDICULOUS SECRETS
FOR SHAME AND YOU MUST HAVE LED THE WAY IN WRITING
SUCH ABSURDITIES HE WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT OF BEGINNING I'M CERTAIN
'I DIDN'T I DIDN'T SOBBED CATHY FIT TO BREAK HER HEART
'I DIDN'T
ONCE THINK OF LOVING HIM TILL
LOVING CRIED I AS SCORNFULLY AS I COULD UTTER THE WORD
LOVING
DID ANYBODY EVER HEAR THE LIKE I MIGHT JUST AS WELL TALK OF LOVING THE
MILLER WHO COMES ONCE A YEAR TO BUY OUR CORN
PRETTY LOVING INDEED AND
BOTH TIMES TOGETHER YOU HAVE SEEN LINTON HARDLY FOUR HOURS IN YOUR LIFE
NOW HERE IS THE BABYISH TRASH
I'M GOING WITH IT TO THE LIBRARY AND
WE'LL SEE WHAT YOUR FATHER SAYS TO SUCH LOVING
SHE SPRANG AT HER PRECIOUS EPISTLES BUT I HELD THEM ABOVE MY HEAD AND
THEN SHE POURED OUT FURTHER FRANTIC ENTREATIES THAT I WOULD BURN THEM DO
ANYTHING RATHER THAN SHOW THEM
AND BEING REALLY FULLY AS MUCH INCLINED
TO LAUGH AS SCOLD FOR I ESTEEMED IT ALL GIRLISH VANITY I AT LENGTH
RELENTED IN A MEASURE AND ASKED 'IF I CONSENT TO BURN THEM WILL YOU
PROMISE FAITHFULLY NEITHER TO SEND NOR RECEIVE A LETTER AGAIN NOR A BOOK
FOR I PERCEIVE YOU HAVE SENT HIM BOOKS NOR LOCKS OF HAIR NOR RINGS
NOR PLAYTHINGS
'WE DON'T SEND PLAYTHINGS CRIED CATHERINE HER PRIDE OVERCOMING HER
SHAME
'NOR ANYTHING AT ALL THEN MY LADY I SAID
'UNLESS YOU WILL HERE I
GO
'I PROMISE ELLEN SHE CRIED CATCHING MY DRESS
'OH PUT THEM IN THE
FIRE DO DO
BUT WHEN I PROCEEDED TO OPEN A PLACE WITH THE POKER THE SACRIFICE WAS TOO
PAINFUL TO BE BORNE
SHE EARNESTLY SUPPLICATED THAT I WOULD SPARE HER
ONE OR TWO
'ONE OR TWO ELLEN TO KEEP FOR LINTON'S SAKE
I UNKNOTTED THE HANDKERCHIEF AND COMMENCED DROPPING THEM IN FROM AN
ANGLE AND THE FLAME CURLED UP THE CHIMNEY
'I WILL HAVE ONE YOU CRUEL WRETCH SHE SCREAMED DARTING HER HAND INTO
THE FIRE AND DRAWING FORTH SOME HALF CONSUMED FRAGMENTS AT THE EXPENSE
OF HER FINGERS
'VERY WELL AND I WILL HAVE SOME TO EXHIBIT TO PAPA I ANSWERED
SHAKING BACK THE REST INTO THE BUNDLE AND TURNING ANEW TO THE DOOR
SHE EMPTIED HER BLACKENED PIECES INTO THE FLAMES AND MOTIONED ME TO
FINISH THE IMMOLATION
IT WAS DONE I STIRRED UP THE ASHES AND INTERRED
THEM UNDER A SHOVELFUL OF COALS AND SHE MUTELY AND WITH A SENSE OF
INTENSE INJURY RETIRED TO HER PRIVATE APARTMENT
I DESCENDED TO TELL MY
MASTER THAT THE YOUNG LADY'S QUALM OF SICKNESS WAS ALMOST GONE BUT I
JUDGED IT BEST FOR HER TO LIE DOWN A WHILE
SHE WOULDN'T DINE BUT SHE
REAPPEARED AT TEA PALE AND RED ABOUT THE EYES AND MARVELLOUSLY SUBDUED
IN OUTWARD ASPECT
NEXT MORNING I ANSWERED THE LETTER BY A SLIP OF
PAPER INSCRIBED 'MASTER HEATHCLIFF IS REQUESTED TO SEND NO MORE NOTES
TO MISS LINTON AS SHE WILL NOT RECEIVE THEM AND HENCEFORTH THE
LITTLE BOY CAME WITH VACANT POCKETS
CHAPTER XXII
SUMMER DREW TO AN END AND EARLY AUTUMN IT WAS PAST MICHAELMAS BUT THE
HARVEST WAS LATE THAT YEAR AND A FEW OF OUR FIELDS WERE STILL UNCLEARED
MR
LINTON AND HIS DAUGHTER WOULD FREQUENTLY WALK OUT AMONG THE REAPERS
AT THE CARRYING OF THE LAST SHEAVES THEY STAYED TILL DUSK AND THE
EVENING HAPPENING TO BE CHILL AND DAMP MY MASTER CAUGHT A BAD COLD THAT
SETTLED OBSTINATELY ON HIS LUNGS AND CONFINED HIM INDOORS THROUGHOUT THE
WHOLE OF THE WINTER NEARLY WITHOUT INTERMISSION
POOR CATHY FRIGHTENED FROM HER LITTLE ROMANCE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY
SADDER AND DULLER SINCE ITS ABANDONMENT AND HER FATHER INSISTED ON HER
READING LESS AND TAKING MORE EXERCISE
SHE HAD HIS COMPANIONSHIP NO
LONGER I ESTEEMED IT A DUTY TO SUPPLY ITS LACK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
WITH MINE AN INEFFICIENT SUBSTITUTE FOR I COULD ONLY SPARE TWO OR THREE
HOURS FROM MY NUMEROUS DIURNAL OCCUPATIONS TO FOLLOW HER FOOTSTEPS AND
THEN MY SOCIETY WAS OBVIOUSLY LESS DESIRABLE THAN HIS
ON AN AFTERNOON IN OCTOBER OR THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER A FRESH WATERY
AFTERNOON WHEN THE TURF AND PATHS WERE RUSTLING WITH MOIST WITHERED
LEAVES AND THE COLD BLUE SKY WAS HALF HIDDEN BY CLOUDS DARK GREY
STREAMERS RAPIDLY MOUNTING FROM THE WEST AND BODING ABUNDANT RAIN I
REQUESTED MY YOUNG LADY TO FOREGO HER RAMBLE BECAUSE I WAS CERTAIN OF
SHOWERS
SHE REFUSED AND I UNWILLINGLY DONNED A CLOAK AND TOOK MY
UMBRELLA TO ACCOMPANY HER ON A STROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PARK A FORMAL
WALK WHICH SHE GENERALLY AFFECTED IF LOW SPIRITED AND THAT SHE
INVARIABLY WAS WHEN MR
EDGAR HAD BEEN WORSE THAN ORDINARY A THING NEVER
KNOWN FROM HIS CONFESSION BUT GUESSED BOTH BY HER AND ME FROM HIS
INCREASED SILENCE AND THE MELANCHOLY OF HIS COUNTENANCE
SHE WENT SADLY
ON THERE WAS NO RUNNING OR BOUNDING NOW THOUGH THE CHILL WIND MIGHT
WELL HAVE TEMPTED HER TO RACE
AND OFTEN FROM THE SIDE OF MY EYE I
COULD DETECT HER RAISING A HAND AND BRUSHING SOMETHING OFF HER CHEEK
I
GAZED ROUND FOR A MEANS OF DIVERTING HER THOUGHTS
ON ONE SIDE OF THE
ROAD ROSE A HIGH ROUGH BANK WHERE HAZELS AND STUNTED OAKS WITH THEIR
ROOTS HALF EXPOSED HELD UNCERTAIN TENURE THE SOIL WAS TOO LOOSE FOR THE
LATTER AND STRONG WINDS HAD BLOWN SOME NEARLY HORIZONTAL
IN SUMMER
MISS CATHERINE DELIGHTED TO CLIMB ALONG THESE TRUNKS AND SIT IN THE
BRANCHES SWINGING TWENTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND I PLEASED WITH HER
AGILITY AND HER LIGHT CHILDISH HEART STILL CONSIDERED IT PROPER TO
SCOLD EVERY TIME I CAUGHT HER AT SUCH AN ELEVATION BUT SO THAT SHE KNEW
THERE WAS NO NECESSITY FOR DESCENDING
FROM DINNER TO TEA SHE WOULD LIE
IN HER BREEZE ROCKED CRADLE DOING NOTHING EXCEPT SINGING OLD SONGS MY
NURSERY LORE TO HERSELF OR WATCHING THE BIRDS JOINT TENANTS FEED AND
ENTICE THEIR YOUNG ONES TO FLY OR NESTLING WITH CLOSED LIDS HALF
THINKING HALF DREAMING HAPPIER THAN WORDS CAN EXPRESS
'LOOK MISS I EXCLAIMED POINTING TO A NOOK UNDER THE ROOTS OF ONE
TWISTED TREE
'WINTER IS NOT HERE YET
THERE'S A LITTLE FLOWER UP
YONDER THE LAST BUD FROM THE MULTITUDE OF BLUEBELLS THAT CLOUDED THOSE
TURF STEPS IN JULY WITH A LILAC MIST
WILL YOU CLAMBER UP AND PLUCK IT
TO SHOW TO PAPA CATHY STARED A LONG TIME AT THE LONELY BLOSSOM
TREMBLING IN ITS EARTHY SHELTER AND REPLIED AT LENGTH 'NO I'LL NOT
TOUCH IT BUT IT LOOKS MELANCHOLY DOES IT NOT ELLEN
'YES I OBSERVED 'ABOUT AS STARVED AND SUCKLESS AS YOU YOUR CHEEKS ARE
BLOODLESS LET US TAKE HOLD OF HANDS AND RUN
YOU'RE SO LOW I DARESAY I
SHALL KEEP UP WITH YOU
'NO SHE REPEATED AND CONTINUED SAUNTERING ON PAUSING AT INTERVALS TO
MUSE OVER A BIT OF MOSS OR A TUFT OF BLANCHED GRASS OR A FUNGUS
SPREADING ITS BRIGHT ORANGE AMONG THE HEAPS OF BROWN FOLIAGE AND EVER
AND ANON HER HAND WAS LIFTED TO HER AVERTED FACE
'CATHERINE WHY ARE YOU CRYING LOVE I ASKED APPROACHING AND PUTTING
MY ARM OVER HER SHOULDER
'YOU MUSTN'T CRY BECAUSE PAPA HAS A COLD BE
THANKFUL IT IS NOTHING WORSE
SHE NOW PUT NO FURTHER RESTRAINT ON HER TEARS HER BREATH WAS STIFLED BY
SOBS
'OH IT WILL BE SOMETHING WORSE SHE SAID
'AND WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN
PAPA AND YOU LEAVE ME AND I AM BY MYSELF I CAN'T FORGET YOUR WORDS
ELLEN THEY ARE ALWAYS IN MY EAR
HOW LIFE WILL BE CHANGED HOW DREARY
THE WORLD WILL BE WHEN PAPA AND YOU ARE DEAD
'NONE CAN TELL WHETHER YOU WON'T DIE BEFORE US I REPLIED
'IT'S WRONG
TO ANTICIPATE EVIL
WE'LL HOPE THERE ARE YEARS AND YEARS TO COME BEFORE
ANY OF US GO MASTER IS YOUNG AND I AM STRONG AND HARDLY FORTY FIVE
MY
MOTHER LIVED TILL EIGHTY A CANTY DAME TO THE LAST
AND SUPPOSE MR
LINTON WERE SPARED TILL HE SAW SIXTY THAT WOULD BE MORE YEARS THAN YOU
HAVE COUNTED MISS
AND WOULD IT NOT BE FOOLISH TO MOURN A CALAMITY
ABOVE TWENTY YEARS BEFOREHAND
'BUT AUNT ISABELLA WAS YOUNGER THAN PAPA SHE REMARKED GAZING UP WITH
TIMID HOPE TO SEEK FURTHER CONSOLATION
'AUNT ISABELLA HAD NOT YOU AND ME TO NURSE HER I REPLIED
'SHE WASN'T
AS HAPPY AS MASTER SHE HADN'T AS MUCH TO LIVE FOR
ALL YOU NEED DO IS
TO WAIT WELL ON YOUR FATHER AND CHEER HIM BY LETTING HIM SEE YOU
CHEERFUL AND AVOID GIVING HIM ANXIETY ON ANY SUBJECT MIND THAT CATHY
I'LL NOT DISGUISE BUT YOU MIGHT KILL HIM IF YOU WERE WILD AND RECKLESS
AND CHERISHED A FOOLISH FANCIFUL AFFECTION FOR THE SON OF A PERSON WHO
WOULD BE GLAD TO HAVE HIM IN HIS GRAVE AND ALLOWED HIM TO DISCOVER THAT
YOU FRETTED OVER THE SEPARATION HE HAS JUDGED IT EXPEDIENT TO MAKE
'I FRET ABOUT NOTHING ON EARTH EXCEPT PAPA'S ILLNESS ANSWERED MY
COMPANION
'I CARE FOR NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH PAPA
AND I'LL
NEVER NEVER OH NEVER WHILE I HAVE MY SENSES DO AN ACT OR SAY A WORD
TO VEX HIM
I LOVE HIM BETTER THAN MYSELF ELLEN AND I KNOW IT BY THIS
I PRAY EVERY NIGHT THAT I MAY LIVE AFTER HIM BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER BE
MISERABLE THAN THAT HE SHOULD BE THAT PROVES I LOVE HIM BETTER THAN
MYSELF
'GOOD WORDS I REPLIED
'BUT DEEDS MUST PROVE IT ALSO AND AFTER HE IS
WELL REMEMBER YOU DON'T FORGET RESOLUTIONS FORMED IN THE HOUR OF FEAR
AS WE TALKED WE NEARED A DOOR THAT OPENED ON THE ROAD AND MY YOUNG
LADY LIGHTENING INTO SUNSHINE AGAIN CLIMBED UP AND SEATED HERSELF ON
THE TOP OF THE WALL REACHING OVER TO GATHER SOME HIPS THAT BLOOMED
SCARLET ON THE SUMMIT BRANCHES OF THE WILD ROSE TREES SHADOWING THE
HIGHWAY SIDE THE LOWER FRUIT HAD DISAPPEARED BUT ONLY BIRDS COULD TOUCH
THE UPPER EXCEPT FROM CATHY'S PRESENT STATION
IN STRETCHING TO PULL
THEM HER HAT FELL OFF AND AS THE DOOR WAS LOCKED SHE PROPOSED
SCRAMBLING DOWN TO RECOVER IT
I BID HER BE CAUTIOUS LEST SHE GOT A
FALL AND SHE NIMBLY DISAPPEARED
BUT THE RETURN WAS NO SUCH EASY
MATTER THE STONES WERE SMOOTH AND NEATLY CEMENTED AND THE ROSE BUSHES
AND BLACK BERRY STRAGGLERS COULD YIELD NO ASSISTANCE IN RE ASCENDING
I
LIKE A FOOL DIDN'T RECOLLECT THAT TILL I HEARD HER LAUGHING AND
EXCLAIMING 'ELLEN YOU'LL HAVE TO FETCH THE KEY OR ELSE I MUST RUN
ROUND TO THE PORTER'S LODGE
I CAN'T SCALE THE RAMPARTS ON THIS SIDE
'STAY WHERE YOU ARE I ANSWERED 'I HAVE MY BUNDLE OF KEYS IN MY POCKET
PERHAPS I MAY MANAGE TO OPEN IT IF NOT I'LL GO
CATHERINE AMUSED HERSELF WITH DANCING TO AND FRO BEFORE THE DOOR WHILE I
TRIED ALL THE LARGE KEYS IN SUCCESSION
I HAD APPLIED THE LAST AND
FOUND THAT NONE WOULD DO SO REPEATING MY DESIRE THAT SHE WOULD REMAIN
THERE I WAS ABOUT TO HURRY HOME AS FAST AS I COULD WHEN AN APPROACHING
SOUND ARRESTED ME
IT WAS THE TROT OF A HORSE CATHY'S DANCE STOPPED
ALSO
'WHO IS THAT I WHISPERED
'ELLEN I WISH YOU COULD OPEN THE DOOR WHISPERED BACK MY COMPANION
ANXIOUSLY
'HO MISS LINTON CRIED A DEEP VOICE THE RIDER'S 'I'M GLAD TO MEET
YOU
DON'T BE IN HASTE TO ENTER FOR I HAVE AN EXPLANATION TO ASK AND
OBTAIN
'I SHA'N'T SPEAK TO YOU MR
HEATHCLIFF ANSWERED CATHERINE
'PAPA SAYS
YOU ARE A WICKED MAN AND YOU HATE BOTH HIM AND ME AND ELLEN SAYS THE
SAME
'THAT IS NOTHING TO THE PURPOSE SAID HEATHCLIFF
HE IT WAS 'I
DON'T HATE MY SON I SUPPOSE AND IT IS CONCERNING HIM THAT I DEMAND YOUR
ATTENTION
YES YOU HAVE CAUSE TO BLUSH
TWO OR THREE MONTHS SINCE
WERE YOU NOT IN THE HABIT OF WRITING TO LINTON MAKING LOVE IN PLAY EH
YOU DESERVED BOTH OF YOU FLOGGING FOR THAT YOU ESPECIALLY THE ELDER
AND LESS SENSITIVE AS IT TURNS OUT
I'VE GOT YOUR LETTERS AND IF YOU
GIVE ME ANY PERTNESS I'LL SEND THEM TO YOUR FATHER
I PRESUME YOU GREW
WEARY OF THE AMUSEMENT AND DROPPED IT DIDN'T YOU WELL YOU DROPPED
LINTON WITH IT INTO A SLOUGH OF DESPOND
HE WAS IN EARNEST IN LOVE
REALLY
AS TRUE AS I LIVE HE'S DYING FOR YOU BREAKING HIS HEART AT
YOUR FICKLENESS NOT FIGURATIVELY BUT ACTUALLY
THOUGH HARETON HAS MADE
HIM A STANDING JEST FOR SIX WEEKS AND I HAVE USED MORE SERIOUS MEASURES
AND ATTEMPTED TO FRIGHTEN HIM OUT OF HIS IDIOTCY HE GETS WORSE DAILY
AND HE'LL BE UNDER THE SOD BEFORE SUMMER UNLESS YOU RESTORE HIM
'HOW CAN YOU LIE SO GLARINGLY TO THE POOR CHILD I CALLED FROM THE
INSIDE
'PRAY RIDE ON HOW CAN YOU DELIBERATELY GET UP SUCH PALTRY
FALSEHOODS MISS CATHY I'LL KNOCK THE LOCK OFF WITH A STONE YOU WON'T
BELIEVE THAT VILE NONSENSE
YOU CAN FEEL IN YOURSELF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT A PERSON SHOULD DIE FOR LOVE OF A STRANGER
'I WAS NOT AWARE THERE WERE EAVESDROPPERS MUTTERED THE DETECTED
VILLAIN
'WORTHY MRS
DEAN I LIKE YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE YOUR
DOUBLE DEALING HE ADDED ALOUD
'HOW COULD YOU LIE SO GLARINGLY AS TO
AFFIRM I HATED THE POOR CHILD AND INVENT BUGBEAR STORIES TO TERRIFY
HER FROM MY DOOR STONES CATHERINE LINTON THE VERY NAME WARMS ME MY
BONNY LASS I SHALL BE FROM HOME ALL THIS WEEK GO AND SEE IF HAVE NOT
SPOKEN TRUTH DO THERE'S A DARLING JUST IMAGINE YOUR FATHER IN MY
PLACE AND LINTON IN YOURS THEN THINK HOW YOU WOULD VALUE YOUR CARELESS
LOVER IF HE REFUSED TO STIR A STEP TO COMFORT YOU WHEN YOUR FATHER
HIMSELF ENTREATED HIM AND DON'T FROM PURE STUPIDITY FALL INTO THE
SAME ERROR
I SWEAR ON MY SALVATION HE'S GOING TO HIS GRAVE AND NONE
BUT YOU CAN SAVE HIM
THE LOCK GAVE WAY AND I ISSUED OUT
'I SWEAR LINTON IS DYING REPEATED HEATHCLIFF LOOKING HARD AT ME
'AND
GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT ARE HASTENING HIS DEATH
NELLY IF YOU WON'T
LET HER GO YOU CAN WALK OVER YOURSELF
BUT I SHALL NOT RETURN TILL THIS
TIME NEXT WEEK AND I THINK YOUR MASTER HIMSELF WOULD SCARCELY OBJECT TO
HER VISITING HER COUSIN
'COME IN SAID I TAKING CATHY BY THE ARM AND HALF FORCING HER TO
RE ENTER FOR SHE LINGERED VIEWING WITH TROUBLED EYES THE FEATURES OF
THE SPEAKER TOO STERN TO EXPRESS HIS INWARD DECEIT
HE PUSHED HIS HORSE CLOSE AND BENDING DOWN OBSERVED 'MISS CATHERINE
I'LL OWN TO YOU THAT I HAVE LITTLE PATIENCE WITH LINTON AND HARETON AND
JOSEPH HAVE LESS
I'LL OWN THAT HE'S WITH A HARSH SET
HE PINES FOR
KINDNESS AS WELL AS LOVE AND A KIND WORD FROM YOU WOULD BE HIS BEST
MEDICINE
DON'T MIND MRS
DEAN'S CRUEL CAUTIONS BUT BE GENEROUS AND
CONTRIVE TO SEE HIM
HE DREAMS OF YOU DAY AND NIGHT AND CANNOT BE
PERSUADED THAT YOU DON'T HATE HIM SINCE YOU NEITHER WRITE NOR CALL
I CLOSED THE DOOR AND ROLLED A STONE TO ASSIST THE LOOSENED LOCK IN
HOLDING IT AND SPREADING MY UMBRELLA I DREW MY CHARGE UNDERNEATH FOR
THE RAIN BEGAN TO DRIVE THROUGH THE MOANING BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND
WARNED US TO AVOID DELAY
OUR HURRY PREVENTED ANY COMMENT ON THE
ENCOUNTER WITH HEATHCLIFF AS WE STRETCHED TOWARDS HOME BUT I DIVINED
INSTINCTIVELY THAT CATHERINE'S HEART WAS CLOUDED NOW IN DOUBLE DARKNESS
HER FEATURES WERE SO SAD THEY DID NOT SEEM HERS SHE EVIDENTLY REGARDED
WHAT SHE HAD HEARD AS EVERY SYLLABLE TRUE
THE MASTER HAD RETIRED TO REST BEFORE WE CAME IN
CATHY STOLE TO HIS
ROOM TO INQUIRE HOW HE WAS HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP
SHE RETURNED AND
ASKED ME TO SIT WITH HER IN THE LIBRARY
WE TOOK OUR TEA TOGETHER AND
AFTERWARDS SHE LAY DOWN ON THE RUG AND TOLD ME NOT TO TALK FOR SHE WAS
WEARY
I GOT A BOOK AND PRETENDED TO READ
AS SOON AS SHE SUPPOSED ME
ABSORBED IN MY OCCUPATION SHE RECOMMENCED HER SILENT WEEPING IT
APPEARED AT PRESENT HER FAVOURITE DIVERSION
I SUFFERED HER TO ENJOY
IT A WHILE THEN I EXPOSTULATED DERIDING AND RIDICULING ALL MR
HEATHCLIFF'S ASSERTIONS ABOUT HIS SON AS IF I WERE CERTAIN SHE WOULD
COINCIDE
ALAS I HADN'T SKILL TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECT HIS ACCOUNT HAD
PRODUCED IT WAS JUST WHAT HE INTENDED
'YOU MAY BE RIGHT ELLEN SHE ANSWERED 'BUT I SHALL NEVER FEEL AT EASE
TILL I KNOW
AND I MUST TELL LINTON IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT I DON'T
WRITE AND CONVINCE HIM THAT I SHALL NOT CHANGE
WHAT USE WERE ANGER AND PROTESTATIONS AGAINST HER SILLY CREDULITY WE
PARTED THAT NIGHT HOSTILE BUT NEXT DAY BEHELD ME ON THE ROAD TO
WUTHERING HEIGHTS BY THE SIDE OF MY WILFUL YOUNG MISTRESS'S PONY
I
COULDN'T BEAR TO WITNESS HER SORROW TO SEE HER PALE DEJECTED
COUNTENANCE AND HEAVY EYES AND I YIELDED IN THE FAINT HOPE THAT LINTON
HIMSELF MIGHT PROVE BY HIS RECEPTION OF US HOW LITTLE OF THE TALE WAS
FOUNDED ON FACT
CHAPTER XXIII
THE RAINY NIGHT HAD USHERED IN A MISTY MORNING HALF FROST HALF
DRIZZLE AND TEMPORARY BROOKS CROSSED OUR PATH GURGLING FROM THE
UPLANDS
MY FEET WERE THOROUGHLY WETTED I WAS CROSS AND LOW EXACTLY
THE HUMOUR SUITED FOR MAKING THE MOST OF THESE DISAGREEABLE THINGS
WE
ENTERED THE FARM HOUSE BY THE KITCHEN WAY TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER MR
HEATHCLIFF WERE REALLY ABSENT BECAUSE I PUT SLIGHT FAITH IN HIS OWN
AFFIRMATION
JOSEPH SEEMED SITTING IN A SORT OF ELYSIUM ALONE BESIDE A ROARING FIRE
A QUART OF ALE ON THE TABLE NEAR HIM BRISTLING WITH LARGE PIECES OF
TOASTED OAT CAKE AND HIS BLACK SHORT PIPE IN HIS MOUTH
CATHERINE RAN
TO THE HEARTH TO WARM HERSELF
I ASKED IF THE MASTER WAS IN MY
QUESTION REMAINED SO LONG UNANSWERED THAT I THOUGHT THE OLD MAN HAD
GROWN DEAF AND REPEATED IT LOUDER
'NA AY HE SNARLED OR RATHER SCREAMED THROUGH HIS NOSE
'NA AY YAH
MUH GOA BACK WHEAR YAH COOM FROUGH
'JOSEPH CRIED A PEEVISH VOICE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH ME FROM THE INNER
ROOM
'HOW OFTEN AM I TO CALL YOU THERE ARE ONLY A FEW RED ASHES NOW
JOSEPH COME THIS MOMENT
VIGOROUS PUFFS AND A RESOLUTE STARE INTO THE GRATE DECLARED HE HAD NO
EAR FOR THIS APPEAL
THE HOUSEKEEPER AND HARETON WERE INVISIBLE ONE
GONE ON AN ERRAND AND THE OTHER AT HIS WORK PROBABLY
WE KNEW LINTON'S
TONES AND ENTERED
'OH I HOPE YOU'LL DIE IN A GARRET STARVED TO DEATH SAID THE BOY
MISTAKING OUR APPROACH FOR THAT OF HIS NEGLIGENT ATTENDANT
HE STOPPED ON OBSERVING HIS ERROR HIS COUSIN FLEW TO HIM
'IS THAT YOU MISS LINTON HE SAID RAISING HIS HEAD FROM THE ARM OF THE
GREAT CHAIR IN WHICH HE RECLINED
'NO DON'T KISS ME IT TAKES MY
BREATH
DEAR ME PAPA SAID YOU WOULD CALL CONTINUED HE AFTER
RECOVERING A LITTLE FROM CATHERINE'S EMBRACE WHILE SHE STOOD BY LOOKING
VERY CONTRITE
'WILL YOU SHUT THE DOOR IF YOU PLEASE YOU LEFT IT OPEN
AND THOSE THOSE DETESTABLE CREATURES WON'T BRING COALS TO THE FIRE
IT'S SO COLD
I STIRRED UP THE CINDERS AND FETCHED A SCUTTLEFUL MYSELF
THE INVALID
COMPLAINED OF BEING COVERED WITH ASHES BUT HE HAD A TIRESOME COUGH AND
LOOKED FEVERISH AND ILL SO I DID NOT REBUKE HIS TEMPER
'WELL LINTON MURMURED CATHERINE WHEN HIS CORRUGATED BROW RELAXED
'ARE YOU GLAD TO SEE ME CAN I DO YOU ANY GOOD
'WHY DIDN'T YOU COME BEFORE HE ASKED
'YOU SHOULD HAVE COME INSTEAD
OF WRITING
IT TIRED ME DREADFULLY WRITING THOSE LONG LETTERS
I'D FAR
RATHER HAVE TALKED TO YOU
NOW I CAN NEITHER BEAR TO TALK NOR ANYTHING
ELSE
I WONDER WHERE ZILLAH IS WILL YOU' LOOKING AT ME 'STEP INTO
THE KITCHEN AND SEE
I HAD RECEIVED NO THANKS FOR MY OTHER SERVICE AND BEING UNWILLING TO RUN
TO AND FRO AT HIS BEHEST I REPLIED 'NOBODY IS OUT THERE BUT JOSEPH
'I WANT TO DRINK HE EXCLAIMED FRETFULLY TURNING AWAY
'ZILLAH IS
CONSTANTLY GADDING OFF TO GIMMERTON SINCE PAPA WENT IT'S MISERABLE AND
I'M OBLIGED TO COME DOWN HERE THEY RESOLVED NEVER TO HEAR ME UP STAIRS
'IS YOUR FATHER ATTENTIVE TO YOU MASTER HEATHCLIFF I ASKED PERCEIVING
CATHERINE TO BE CHECKED IN HER FRIENDLY ADVANCES
'ATTENTIVE HE MAKES THEM A LITTLE MORE ATTENTIVE AT LEAST HE CRIED
'THE WRETCHES DO YOU KNOW MISS LINTON THAT BRUTE HARETON LAUGHS AT
ME I HATE HIM INDEED I HATE THEM ALL THEY ARE ODIOUS BEINGS
CATHY BEGAN SEARCHING FOR SOME WATER SHE LIGHTED ON A PITCHER IN THE
DRESSER FILLED A TUMBLER AND BROUGHT IT
HE BID HER ADD A SPOONFUL OF
WINE FROM A BOTTLE ON THE TABLE AND HAVING SWALLOWED A SMALL PORTION
APPEARED MORE TRANQUIL AND SAID SHE WAS VERY KIND
'AND ARE YOU GLAD TO SEE ME ASKED SHE REITERATING HER FORMER QUESTION
AND PLEASED TO DETECT THE FAINT DAWN OF A SMILE
'YES I AM
IT'S SOMETHING NEW TO HEAR A VOICE LIKE YOURS HE REPLIED
'BUT I HAVE BEEN VEXED BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T COME
AND PAPA SWORE IT WAS
OWING TO ME HE CALLED ME A PITIFUL SHUFFLING WORTHLESS THING AND SAID
YOU DESPISED ME AND IF HE HAD BEEN IN MY PLACE HE WOULD BE MORE THE
MASTER OF THE GRANGE THAN YOUR FATHER BY THIS TIME
BUT YOU DON'T
DESPISE ME DO YOU MISS
'I WISH YOU WOULD SAY CATHERINE OR CATHY INTERRUPTED MY YOUNG LADY
'DESPISE YOU NO NEXT TO PAPA AND ELLEN I LOVE YOU BETTER THAN
ANYBODY LIVING
I DON'T LOVE MR
HEATHCLIFF THOUGH AND I DARE NOT COME
WHEN HE RETURNS WILL HE STAY AWAY MANY DAYS
'NOT MANY ANSWERED LINTON 'BUT HE GOES ON TO THE MOORS FREQUENTLY
SINCE THE SHOOTING SEASON COMMENCED AND YOU MIGHT SPEND AN HOUR OR TWO
WITH ME IN HIS ABSENCE
DO SAY YOU WILL
I THINK I SHOULD NOT BE
PEEVISH WITH YOU YOU'D NOT PROVOKE ME AND YOU'D ALWAYS BE READY TO HELP
ME WOULDN'T YOU
'YES SAID CATHERINE STROKING HIS LONG SOFT HAIR 'IF I COULD ONLY GET
PAPA'S CONSENT I'D SPEND HALF MY TIME WITH YOU
PRETTY LINTON I WISH
YOU WERE MY BROTHER
'AND THEN YOU WOULD LIKE ME AS WELL AS YOUR FATHER OBSERVED HE MORE
CHEERFULLY
'BUT PAPA SAYS YOU WOULD LOVE ME BETTER THAN HIM AND ALL THE
WORLD IF YOU WERE MY WIFE SO I'D RATHER YOU WERE THAT
'NO I SHOULD NEVER LOVE ANYBODY BETTER THAN PAPA SHE RETURNED GRAVELY
'AND PEOPLE HATE THEIR WIVES SOMETIMES BUT NOT THEIR SISTERS AND
BROTHERS AND IF YOU WERE THE LATTER YOU WOULD LIVE WITH US AND PAPA
WOULD BE AS FOND OF YOU AS HE IS OF ME
LINTON DENIED THAT PEOPLE EVER HATED THEIR WIVES BUT CATHY AFFIRMED THEY
DID AND IN HER WISDOM INSTANCED HIS OWN FATHER'S AVERSION TO HER AUNT
I ENDEAVOURED TO STOP HER THOUGHTLESS TONGUE
I COULDN'T SUCCEED TILL
EVERYTHING SHE KNEW WAS OUT
MASTER HEATHCLIFF MUCH IRRITATED ASSERTED
HER RELATION WAS FALSE
'PAPA TOLD ME AND PAPA DOES NOT TELL FALSEHOODS SHE ANSWERED PERTLY
MY PAPA SCORNS YOURS CRIED LINTON
'HE CALLS HIM A SNEAKING FOOL
'YOURS IS A WICKED MAN RETORTED CATHERINE 'AND YOU ARE VERY NAUGHTY TO
DARE TO REPEAT WHAT HE SAYS
HE MUST BE WICKED TO HAVE MADE AUNT
ISABELLA LEAVE HIM AS SHE DID
'SHE DIDN'T LEAVE HIM SAID THE BOY 'YOU SHA'N'T CONTRADICT ME
'SHE DID CRIED MY YOUNG LADY
'WELL I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING SAID LINTON
'YOUR MOTHER HATED YOUR
FATHER NOW THEN
'OH EXCLAIMED CATHERINE TOO ENRAGED TO CONTINUE
'AND SHE LOVED MINE ADDED HE
'YOU LITTLE LIAR I HATE YOU NOW SHE PANTED AND HER FACE GREW RED
WITH PASSION
'SHE DID SHE DID SANG LINTON SINKING INTO THE RECESS OF HIS CHAIR
AND LEANING BACK HIS HEAD TO ENJOY THE AGITATION OF THE OTHER DISPUTANT
WHO STOOD BEHIND
'HUSH MASTER HEATHCLIFF I SAID 'THAT'S YOUR FATHER'S TALE TOO I
SUPPOSE
'IT ISN'T YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE ANSWERED
'SHE DID SHE DID
CATHERINE SHE DID SHE DID
CATHY BESIDE HERSELF GAVE THE CHAIR A VIOLENT PUSH AND CAUSED HIM TO
FALL AGAINST ONE ARM
HE WAS IMMEDIATELY SEIZED BY A SUFFOCATING COUGH
THAT SOON ENDED HIS TRIUMPH
IT LASTED SO LONG THAT IT FRIGHTENED EVEN
ME
AS TO HIS COUSIN SHE WEPT WITH ALL HER MIGHT AGHAST AT THE
MISCHIEF SHE HAD DONE THOUGH SHE SAID NOTHING
I HELD HIM TILL THE FIT
EXHAUSTED ITSELF
THEN HE THRUST ME AWAY AND LEANT HIS HEAD DOWN
SILENTLY
CATHERINE QUELLED HER LAMENTATIONS ALSO TOOK A SEAT OPPOSITE
AND LOOKED SOLEMNLY INTO THE FIRE
'HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW MASTER HEATHCLIFF I INQUIRED AFTER WAITING TEN
MINUTES
'I WISH SHE FELT AS I DO HE REPLIED 'SPITEFUL CRUEL THING HARETON
NEVER TOUCHES ME HE NEVER STRUCK ME IN HIS LIFE
AND I WAS BETTER
TO DAY AND THERE HIS VOICE DIED IN A WHIMPER
I DIDN'T STRIKE YOU MUTTERED CATHY CHEWING HER LIP TO PREVENT
ANOTHER BURST OF EMOTION
HE SIGHED AND MOANED LIKE ONE UNDER GREAT SUFFERING AND KEPT IT UP FOR A
QUARTER OF AN HOUR ON PURPOSE TO DISTRESS HIS COUSIN APPARENTLY FOR
WHENEVER HE CAUGHT A STIFLED SOB FROM HER HE PUT RENEWED PAIN AND PATHOS
INTO THE INFLEXIONS OF HIS VOICE
'I'M SORRY I HURT YOU LINTON SHE SAID AT LENGTH RACKED BEYOND
ENDURANCE
'BUT I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HURT BY THAT LITTLE PUSH AND I HAD
NO IDEA THAT YOU COULD EITHER YOU'RE NOT MUCH ARE YOU LINTON DON'T
LET ME GO HOME THINKING I'VE DONE YOU HARM
ANSWER SPEAK TO ME
'I CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU HE MURMURED 'YOU'VE HURT ME SO THAT I SHALL LIE
AWAKE ALL NIGHT CHOKING WITH THIS COUGH
IF YOU HAD IT YOU'D KNOW WHAT
IT WAS BUT YOU'LL BE COMFORTABLY ASLEEP WHILE I'M IN AGONY AND NOBODY
NEAR ME
I WONDER HOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO PASS THOSE FEARFUL NIGHTS AND
HE BEGAN TO WAIL ALOUD FOR VERY PITY OF HIMSELF
'SINCE YOU ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING DREADFUL NIGHTS I SAID 'IT
WON'T BE MISS WHO SPOILS YOUR EASE YOU'D BE THE SAME HAD SHE NEVER COME
HOWEVER SHE SHALL NOT DISTURB YOU AGAIN AND PERHAPS YOU'LL GET QUIETER
WHEN WE LEAVE YOU
'MUST I GO ASKED CATHERINE DOLEFULLY BENDING OVER HIM
'DO YOU WANT
ME TO GO LINTON
'YOU CAN'T ALTER WHAT YOU'VE DONE HE REPLIED PETTISHLY SHRINKING FROM
HER 'UNLESS YOU ALTER IT FOR THE WORSE BY TEASING ME INTO A FEVER
'WELL THEN I MUST GO SHE REPEATED
'LET ME ALONE AT LEAST SAID HE 'I CAN'T BEAR YOUR TALKING
SHE LINGERED AND RESISTED MY PERSUASIONS TO DEPARTURE A TIRESOME WHILE
BUT AS HE NEITHER LOOKED UP NOR SPOKE SHE FINALLY MADE A MOVEMENT TO THE
DOOR AND I FOLLOWED
WE WERE RECALLED BY A SCREAM
LINTON HAD SLID
FROM HIS SEAT ON TO THE HEARTHSTONE AND LAY WRITHING IN THE MERE
PERVERSENESS OF AN INDULGED PLAGUE OF A CHILD DETERMINED TO BE AS
GRIEVOUS AND HARASSING AS IT CAN
I THOROUGHLY GAUGED HIS DISPOSITION
FROM HIS BEHAVIOUR AND SAW AT ONCE IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO ATTEMPT
HUMOURING HIM
NOT SO MY COMPANION SHE RAN BACK IN TERROR KNELT DOWN
AND CRIED AND SOOTHED AND ENTREATED TILL HE GREW QUIET FROM LACK OF
BREATH BY NO MEANS FROM COMPUNCTION AT DISTRESSING HER
'I SHALL LIFT HIM ON TO THE SETTLE I SAID 'AND HE MAY ROLL ABOUT AS HE
PLEASES WE CAN'T STOP TO WATCH HIM
I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED MISS
CATHY THAT YOU ARE NOT THE PERSON TO BENEFIT HIM AND THAT HIS CONDITION
OF HEALTH IS NOT OCCASIONED BY ATTACHMENT TO YOU
NOW THEN THERE HE
IS COME AWAY AS SOON AS HE KNOWS THERE IS NOBODY BY TO CARE FOR HIS
NONSENSE HE'LL BE GLAD TO LIE STILL
SHE PLACED A CUSHION UNDER HIS HEAD AND OFFERED HIM SOME WATER HE
REJECTED THE LATTER AND TOSSED UNEASILY ON THE FORMER AS IF IT WERE A
STONE OR A BLOCK OF WOOD
SHE TRIED TO PUT IT MORE COMFORTABLY
'I CAN'T DO WITH THAT HE SAID 'IT'S NOT HIGH ENOUGH
CATHERINE BROUGHT ANOTHER TO LAY ABOVE IT
'THAT'S TOO HIGH MURMURED THE PROVOKING THING
'HOW MUST I ARRANGE IT THEN SHE ASKED DESPAIRINGLY
HE TWINED HIMSELF UP TO HER AS SHE HALF KNELT BY THE SETTLE AND
CONVERTED HER SHOULDER INTO A SUPPORT
'NO THAT WON'T DO I SAID
'YOU'LL BE CONTENT WITH THE CUSHION MASTER
HEATHCLIFF
MISS HAS WASTED TOO MUCH TIME ON YOU ALREADY WE CANNOT
REMAIN FIVE MINUTES LONGER
'YES YES WE CAN REPLIED CATHY
'HE'S GOOD AND PATIENT NOW
HE'S
BEGINNING TO THINK I SHALL HAVE FAR GREATER MISERY THAN HE WILL TO NIGHT
IF I BELIEVE HE IS THE WORSE FOR MY VISIT AND THEN I DARE NOT COME
AGAIN
TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT LINTON FOR I MUSN'T COME IF I HAVE
HURT YOU
'YOU MUST COME TO CURE ME HE ANSWERED
'YOU OUGHT TO COME BECAUSE
YOU HAVE HURT ME YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EXTREMELY I WAS NOT AS ILL WHEN YOU
ENTERED AS I AM AT PRESENT WAS I
'BUT YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF ILL BY CRYING AND BEING IN A PASSION I DIDN'T
DO IT ALL SAID HIS COUSIN
'HOWEVER WE'LL BE FRIENDS NOW
AND YOU
WANT ME YOU WOULD WISH TO SEE ME SOMETIMES REALLY
'I TOLD YOU I DID HE REPLIED IMPATIENTLY
'SIT ON THE SETTLE AND LET
ME LEAN ON YOUR KNEE
THAT'S AS MAMMA USED TO DO WHOLE AFTERNOONS
TOGETHER
SIT QUITE STILL AND DON'T TALK BUT YOU MAY SING A SONG IF
YOU CAN SING OR YOU MAY SAY A NICE LONG INTERESTING BALLAD ONE OF THOSE
YOU PROMISED TO TEACH ME OR A STORY
I'D RATHER HAVE A BALLAD THOUGH
BEGIN
CATHERINE REPEATED THE LONGEST SHE COULD REMEMBER
THE EMPLOYMENT
PLEASED BOTH MIGHTILY
LINTON WOULD HAVE ANOTHER AND AFTER THAT
ANOTHER NOTWITHSTANDING MY STRENUOUS OBJECTIONS AND SO THEY WENT ON
UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND WE HEARD HARETON IN THE COURT
RETURNING FOR HIS DINNER
'AND TO MORROW CATHERINE WILL YOU BE HERE TO MORROW ASKED YOUNG
HEATHCLIFF HOLDING HER FROCK AS SHE ROSE RELUCTANTLY
'NO I ANSWERED 'NOR NEXT DAY NEITHER SHE HOWEVER GAVE A DIFFERENT
RESPONSE EVIDENTLY FOR HIS FOREHEAD CLEARED AS SHE STOOPED AND WHISPERED
IN HIS EAR
'YOU WON'T GO TO MORROW RECOLLECT MISS I COMMENCED WHEN WE WERE OUT
OF THE HOUSE
'YOU ARE NOT DREAMING OF IT ARE YOU
SHE SMILED
'OH I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE I CONTINUED 'I'LL HAVE THAT LOCK MENDED AND
YOU CAN ESCAPE BY NO WAY ELSE
'I CAN GET OVER THE WALL SHE SAID LAUGHING
'THE GRANGE IS NOT A
PRISON ELLEN AND YOU ARE NOT MY GAOLER
AND BESIDES I'M ALMOST
SEVENTEEN I'M A WOMAN
AND I'M CERTAIN LINTON WOULD RECOVER QUICKLY IF
HE HAD ME TO LOOK AFTER HIM
I'M OLDER THAN HE IS YOU KNOW AND WISER
LESS CHILDISH AM I NOT AND HE'LL SOON DO AS I DIRECT HIM WITH SOME
SLIGHT COAXING
HE'S A PRETTY LITTLE DARLING WHEN HE'S GOOD
I'D MAKE
SUCH A PET OF HIM IF HE WERE MINE
WE SHOULD NEVER QUARREL SHOULD WE
AFTER WE WERE USED TO EACH OTHER DON'T YOU LIKE HIM ELLEN
'LIKE HIM I EXCLAIMED
'THE WORST TEMPERED BIT OF A SICKLY SLIP THAT
EVER STRUGGLED INTO ITS TEENS
HAPPILY AS MR
HEATHCLIFF CONJECTURED
HE'LL NOT WIN TWENTY
I DOUBT WHETHER HE'LL SEE SPRING INDEED
AND
SMALL LOSS TO HIS FAMILY WHENEVER HE DROPS OFF
AND LUCKY IT IS FOR US
THAT HIS FATHER TOOK HIM THE KINDER HE WAS TREATED THE MORE TEDIOUS AND
SELFISH HE'D BE
I'M GLAD YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF HAVING HIM FOR A
HUSBAND MISS CATHERINE
MY COMPANION WAXED SERIOUS AT HEARING THIS SPEECH
TO SPEAK OF HIS DEATH
SO REGARDLESSLY WOUNDED HER FEELINGS
'HE'S YOUNGER THAN I SHE ANSWERED AFTER A PROTRACTED PAUSE OF
MEDITATION 'AND HE OUGHT TO LIVE THE LONGEST HE WILL HE MUST LIVE AS
LONG AS I DO
HE'S AS STRONG NOW AS WHEN HE FIRST CAME INTO THE NORTH
I'M POSITIVE OF THAT
IT'S ONLY A COLD THAT AILS HIM THE SAME AS PAPA
HAS
YOU SAY PAPA WILL GET BETTER AND WHY SHOULDN'T HE
'WELL WELL I CRIED 'AFTER ALL WE NEEDN'T TROUBLE OURSELVES FOR
LISTEN MISS AND MIND I'LL KEEP MY WORD IF YOU ATTEMPT GOING TO
WUTHERING HEIGHTS AGAIN WITH OR WITHOUT ME I SHALL INFORM MR
LINTON
AND UNLESS HE ALLOW IT THE INTIMACY WITH YOUR COUSIN MUST NOT BE
REVIVED
'IT HAS BEEN REVIVED MUTTERED CATHY SULKILY
'MUST NOT BE CONTINUED THEN I SAID
'WE'LL SEE WAS HER REPLY AND SHE SET OFF AT A GALLOP LEAVING ME TO
TOIL IN THE REAR
WE BOTH REACHED HOME BEFORE OUR DINNER TIME MY MASTER SUPPOSED WE HAD
BEEN WANDERING THROUGH THE PARK AND THEREFORE HE DEMANDED NO EXPLANATION
OF OUR ABSENCE
AS SOON AS I ENTERED I HASTENED TO CHANGE MY SOAKED
SHOES AND STOCKINGS BUT SITTING SUCH AWHILE AT THE HEIGHTS HAD DONE THE
MISCHIEF
ON THE SUCCEEDING MORNING I WAS LAID UP AND DURING THREE
WEEKS I REMAINED INCAPACITATED FOR ATTENDING TO MY DUTIES A CALAMITY
NEVER EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THAT PERIOD AND NEVER I AM THANKFUL TO SAY
SINCE
MY LITTLE MISTRESS BEHAVED LIKE AN ANGEL IN COMING TO WAIT ON ME AND
CHEER MY SOLITUDE THE CONFINEMENT BROUGHT ME EXCEEDINGLY LOW
IT IS
WEARISOME TO A STIRRING ACTIVE BODY BUT FEW HAVE SLIGHTER REASONS FOR
COMPLAINT THAN I HAD
THE MOMENT CATHERINE LEFT MR
LINTON'S ROOM SHE
APPEARED AT MY BEDSIDE
HER DAY WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN US NO AMUSEMENT
USURPED A MINUTE SHE NEGLECTED HER MEALS HER STUDIES AND HER PLAY AND
SHE WAS THE FONDEST NURSE THAT EVER WATCHED
SHE MUST HAVE HAD A WARM
HEART WHEN SHE LOVED HER FATHER SO TO GIVE SO MUCH TO ME
I SAID HER
DAYS WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN US BUT THE MASTER RETIRED EARLY AND I
GENERALLY NEEDED NOTHING AFTER SIX O'CLOCK THUS THE EVENING WAS HER OWN
POOR THING I NEVER CONSIDERED WHAT SHE DID WITH HERSELF AFTER TEA
AND
THOUGH FREQUENTLY WHEN SHE LOOKED IN TO BID ME GOOD NIGHT I REMARKED A
FRESH COLOUR IN HER CHEEKS AND A PINKNESS OVER HER SLENDER FINGERS
INSTEAD OF FANCYING THE LINE BORROWED FROM A COLD RIDE ACROSS THE MOORS
I LAID IT TO THE CHARGE OF A HOT FIRE IN THE LIBRARY
CHAPTER XXIV
AT THE CLOSE OF THREE WEEKS I WAS ABLE TO QUIT MY CHAMBER AND MOVE ABOUT
THE HOUSE
AND ON THE FIRST OCCASION OF MY SITTING UP IN THE EVENING I
ASKED CATHERINE TO READ TO ME BECAUSE MY EYES WERE WEAK
WE WERE IN THE
LIBRARY THE MASTER HAVING GONE TO BED SHE CONSENTED RATHER
UNWILLINGLY I FANCIED AND IMAGINING MY SORT OF BOOKS DID NOT SUIT HER
I BID HER PLEASE HERSELF IN THE CHOICE OF WHAT SHE PERUSED
SHE SELECTED
ONE OF HER OWN FAVOURITES AND GOT FORWARD STEADILY ABOUT AN HOUR THEN
CAME FREQUENT QUESTIONS
'ELLEN ARE NOT YOU TIRED HADN'T YOU BETTER LIE DOWN NOW YOU'LL BE
SICK KEEPING UP SO LONG ELLEN
'NO NO DEAR I'M NOT TIRED I RETURNED CONTINUALLY
PERCEIVING ME IMMOVABLE SHE ESSAYED ANOTHER METHOD OF SHOWING HER
DISRELISH FOR HER OCCUPATION
IT CHANGED TO YAWNING AND STRETCHING
AND
'ELLEN I'M TIRED
'GIVE OVER THEN AND TALK I ANSWERED
THAT WAS WORSE SHE FRETTED AND SIGHED AND LOOKED AT HER WATCH TILL
EIGHT AND FINALLY WENT TO HER ROOM COMPLETELY OVERDONE WITH SLEEP
JUDGING BY HER PEEVISH HEAVY LOOK AND THE CONSTANT RUBBING SHE
INFLICTED ON HER EYES
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT SHE SEEMED MORE IMPATIENT
STILL AND ON THE THIRD FROM RECOVERING MY COMPANY SHE COMPLAINED OF A
HEADACHE AND LEFT ME
I THOUGHT HER CONDUCT ODD AND HAVING REMAINED
ALONE A LONG WHILE I RESOLVED ON GOING AND INQUIRING WHETHER SHE WERE
BETTER AND ASKING HER TO COME AND LIE ON THE SOFA INSTEAD OF UP STAIRS
IN THE DARK
NO CATHERINE COULD I DISCOVER UP STAIRS AND NONE BELOW
THE SERVANTS AFFIRMED THEY HAD NOT SEEN HER
I LISTENED AT MR
EDGAR'S
DOOR ALL WAS SILENCE
I RETURNED TO HER APARTMENT EXTINGUISHED MY
CANDLE AND SEATED MYSELF IN THE WINDOW
THE MOON SHONE BRIGHT A SPRINKLING OF SNOW COVERED THE GROUND AND I
REFLECTED THAT SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE TAKEN IT INTO HER HEAD TO WALK
ABOUT THE GARDEN FOR REFRESHMENT
I DID DETECT A FIGURE CREEPING ALONG
THE INNER FENCE OF THE PARK BUT IT WAS NOT MY YOUNG MISTRESS ON ITS
EMERGING INTO THE LIGHT I RECOGNISED ONE OF THE GROOMS
HE STOOD A
CONSIDERABLE PERIOD VIEWING THE CARRIAGE ROAD THROUGH THE GROUNDS THEN
STARTED OFF AT A BRISK PACE AS IF HE HAD DETECTED SOMETHING AND
REAPPEARED PRESENTLY LEADING MISS'S PONY AND THERE SHE WAS JUST
DISMOUNTED AND WALKING BY ITS SIDE
THE MAN TOOK HIS CHARGE STEALTHILY
ACROSS THE GRASS TOWARDS THE STABLE
CATHY ENTERED BY THE
CASEMENT WINDOW OF THE DRAWING ROOM AND GLIDED NOISELESSLY UP TO WHERE I
AWAITED HER
SHE PUT THE DOOR GENTLY TOO SLIPPED OFF HER SNOWY SHOES
UNTIED HER HAT AND WAS PROCEEDING UNCONSCIOUS OF MY ESPIONAGE TO LAY
ASIDE HER MANTLE WHEN I SUDDENLY ROSE AND REVEALED MYSELF
THE SURPRISE
PETRIFIED HER AN INSTANT SHE UTTERED AN INARTICULATE EXCLAMATION AND
STOOD FIXED
'MY DEAR MISS CATHERINE I BEGAN TOO VIVIDLY IMPRESSED BY HER RECENT
KINDNESS TO BREAK INTO A SCOLD 'WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN RIDING OUT AT THIS
HOUR AND WHY SHOULD YOU TRY TO DECEIVE ME BY TELLING A TALE WHERE
HAVE YOU BEEN SPEAK
'TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PARK SHE STAMMERED
'I DIDN'T TELL A TALE
'AND NOWHERE ELSE I DEMANDED
'NO WAS THE MUTTERED REPLY
'OH CATHERINE I CRIED SORROWFULLY
'YOU KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN DOING
WRONG OR YOU WOULDN'T BE DRIVEN TO UTTERING AN UNTRUTH TO ME
THAT DOES
GRIEVE ME
I'D RATHER BE THREE MONTHS ILL THAN HEAR YOU FRAME A
DELIBERATE LIE
SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND BURSTING INTO TEARS THREW HER ARMS ROUND MY
NECK
'WELL ELLEN I'M SO AFRAID OF YOU BEING ANGRY SHE SAID
'PROMISE NOT
TO BE ANGRY AND YOU SHALL KNOW THE VERY TRUTH I HATE TO HIDE IT
WE SAT DOWN IN THE WINDOW SEAT I ASSURED HER I WOULD NOT SCOLD WHATEVER
HER SECRET MIGHT BE AND I GUESSED IT OF COURSE SO SHE COMMENCED
'I'VE BEEN TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS ELLEN AND I'VE NEVER MISSED GOING A DAY
SINCE YOU FELL ILL EXCEPT THRICE BEFORE AND TWICE AFTER YOU LEFT YOUR
ROOM
I GAVE MICHAEL BOOKS AND PICTURES TO PREPARE MINNY EVERY EVENING
AND TO PUT HER BACK IN THE STABLE YOU MUSTN'T SCOLD HIM EITHER MIND
I
WAS AT THE HEIGHTS BY HALF PAST SIX AND GENERALLY STAYED TILL HALF PAST
EIGHT AND THEN GALLOPED HOME
IT WAS NOT TO AMUSE MYSELF THAT I WENT I
WAS OFTEN WRETCHED ALL THE TIME
NOW AND THEN I WAS HAPPY ONCE IN A
WEEK PERHAPS
AT FIRST I EXPECTED THERE WOULD BE SAD WORK PERSUADING
YOU TO LET ME KEEP MY WORD TO LINTON FOR I HAD ENGAGED TO CALL AGAIN
NEXT DAY WHEN WE QUITTED HIM BUT AS YOU STAYED UP STAIRS ON THE
MORROW I ESCAPED THAT TROUBLE
WHILE MICHAEL WAS REFASTENING THE LOCK
OF THE PARK DOOR IN THE AFTERNOON I GOT POSSESSION OF THE KEY AND TOLD
HIM HOW MY COUSIN WISHED ME TO VISIT HIM BECAUSE HE WAS SICK AND
COULDN'T COME TO THE GRANGE AND HOW PAPA WOULD OBJECT TO MY GOING AND
THEN I NEGOTIATED WITH HIM ABOUT THE PONY
HE IS FOND OF READING AND HE
THINKS OF LEAVING SOON TO GET MARRIED SO HE OFFERED IF I WOULD LEND HIM
BOOKS OUT OF THE LIBRARY TO DO WHAT I WISHED BUT I PREFERRED GIVING HIM
MY OWN AND THAT SATISFIED HIM BETTER
'ON MY SECOND VISIT LINTON SEEMED IN LIVELY SPIRITS AND ZILLAH THAT IS
THEIR HOUSEKEEPER MADE US A CLEAN ROOM AND A GOOD FIRE AND TOLD US
THAT AS JOSEPH WAS OUT AT A PRAYER MEETING AND HARETON EARNSHAW WAS OFF
WITH HIS DOGS ROBBING OUR WOODS OF PHEASANTS AS I HEARD AFTERWARDS WE
MIGHT DO WHAT WE LIKED
SHE BROUGHT ME SOME WARM WINE AND GINGERBREAD
AND APPEARED EXCEEDINGLY GOOD NATURED AND LINTON SAT IN THE ARM CHAIR
AND I IN THE LITTLE ROCKING CHAIR ON THE HEARTH STONE AND WE LAUGHED AND
TALKED SO MERRILY AND FOUND SO MUCH TO SAY WE PLANNED WHERE WE WOULD
GO AND WHAT WE WOULD DO IN SUMMER
I NEEDN'T REPEAT THAT BECAUSE YOU
WOULD CALL IT SILLY
'ONE TIME HOWEVER WE WERE NEAR QUARRELLING
HE SAID THE PLEASANTEST
MANNER OF SPENDING A HOT JULY DAY WAS LYING FROM MORNING TILL EVENING ON
A BANK OF HEATH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOORS WITH THE BEES HUMMING
DREAMILY ABOUT AMONG THE BLOOM AND THE LARKS SINGING HIGH UP OVERHEAD
AND THE BLUE SKY AND BRIGHT SUN SHINING STEADILY AND CLOUDLESSLY
THAT
WAS HIS MOST PERFECT IDEA OF HEAVEN'S HAPPINESS MINE WAS ROCKING IN A
RUSTLING GREEN TREE WITH A WEST WIND BLOWING AND BRIGHT WHITE CLOUDS
FLITTING RAPIDLY ABOVE AND NOT ONLY LARKS BUT THROSTLES AND
BLACKBIRDS AND LINNETS AND CUCKOOS POURING OUT MUSIC ON EVERY SIDE AND
THE MOORS SEEN AT A DISTANCE BROKEN INTO COOL DUSKY DELLS BUT CLOSE BY
GREAT SWELLS OF LONG GRASS UNDULATING IN WAVES TO THE BREEZE AND WOODS
AND SOUNDING WATER AND THE WHOLE WORLD AWAKE AND WILD WITH JOY
HE
WANTED ALL TO LIE IN AN ECSTASY OF PEACE I WANTED ALL TO SPARKLE AND
DANCE IN A GLORIOUS JUBILEE
I SAID HIS HEAVEN WOULD BE ONLY HALF ALIVE
AND HE SAID MINE WOULD BE DRUNK I SAID I SHOULD FALL ASLEEP IN HIS AND
HE SAID HE COULD NOT BREATHE IN MINE AND BEGAN TO GROW VERY SNAPPISH
AT
LAST WE AGREED TO TRY BOTH AS SOON AS THE RIGHT WEATHER CAME AND THEN
WE KISSED EACH OTHER AND WERE FRIENDS
'AFTER SITTING STILL AN HOUR I LOOKED AT THE GREAT ROOM WITH ITS SMOOTH
UNCARPETED FLOOR AND THOUGHT HOW NICE IT WOULD BE TO PLAY IN IF WE
REMOVED THE TABLE AND I ASKED LINTON TO CALL ZILLAH IN TO HELP US AND
WE'D HAVE A GAME AT BLINDMAN'S BUFF SHE SHOULD TRY TO CATCH US YOU USED
TO YOU KNOW ELLEN
HE WOULDN'T THERE WAS NO PLEASURE IN IT HE SAID
BUT HE CONSENTED TO PLAY AT BALL WITH ME
WE FOUND TWO IN A CUPBOARD
AMONG A HEAP OF OLD TOYS TOPS AND HOOPS AND BATTLEDORES AND
SHUTTLECOCKS
ONE WAS MARKED C AND THE OTHER H I WISHED TO HAVE THE
C BECAUSE THAT STOOD FOR CATHERINE AND THE H
MIGHT BE FOR HEATHCLIFF
HIS NAME BUT THE BRAN CAME OUT OF H AND LINTON DIDN'T LIKE IT
I BEAT
HIM CONSTANTLY AND HE GOT CROSS AGAIN AND COUGHED AND RETURNED TO HIS
CHAIR
THAT NIGHT THOUGH HE EASILY RECOVERED HIS GOOD HUMOUR HE WAS
CHARMED WITH TWO OR THREE PRETTY SONGS YOUR SONGS ELLEN AND WHEN I
WAS OBLIGED TO GO HE BEGGED AND ENTREATED ME TO COME THE FOLLOWING
EVENING AND I PROMISED
MINNY AND I WENT FLYING HOME AS LIGHT AS AIR
AND I DREAMT OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS AND MY SWEET DARLING COUSIN TILL
MORNING
'ON THE MORROW I WAS SAD PARTLY BECAUSE YOU WERE POORLY AND PARTLY THAT
I WISHED MY FATHER KNEW AND APPROVED OF MY EXCURSIONS BUT IT WAS
BEAUTIFUL MOONLIGHT AFTER TEA AND AS I RODE ON THE GLOOM CLEARED
I
SHALL HAVE ANOTHER HAPPY EVENING I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AND WHAT DELIGHTS
ME MORE MY PRETTY LINTON WILL
I TROTTED UP THEIR GARDEN AND WAS
TURNING ROUND TO THE BACK WHEN THAT FELLOW EARNSHAW MET ME TOOK MY
BRIDLE AND BID ME GO IN BY THE FRONT ENTRANCE
HE PATTED MINNY'S NECK
AND SAID SHE WAS A BONNY BEAST AND APPEARED AS IF HE WANTED ME TO SPEAK
TO HIM
I ONLY TOLD HIM TO LEAVE MY HORSE ALONE OR ELSE IT WOULD KICK
HIM
HE ANSWERED IN HIS VULGAR ACCENT IT WOULDN'T DO MITCH HURT IF IT
DID AND SURVEYED ITS LEGS WITH A SMILE
I WAS HALF INCLINED TO MAKE IT
TRY HOWEVER HE MOVED OFF TO OPEN THE DOOR AND AS HE RAISED THE LATCH
HE LOOKED UP TO THE INSCRIPTION ABOVE AND SAID WITH A STUPID MIXTURE OF
AWKWARDNESS AND ELATION MISS CATHERINE I CAN READ YON NOW
WONDERFUL I EXCLAIMED
PRAY LET US HEAR YOU YOU ARE GROWN
CLEVER
'HE SPELT AND DRAWLED OVER BY SYLLABLES THE NAME HARETON EARNSHAW
AND THE FIGURES I CRIED ENCOURAGINGLY PERCEIVING THAT HE CAME TO A
DEAD HALT
I CANNOT TELL THEM YET HE ANSWERED
OH YOU DUNCE I SAID LAUGHING HEARTILY AT HIS FAILURE
'THE FOOL STARED WITH A GRIN HOVERING ABOUT HIS LIPS AND A SCOWL
GATHERING OVER HIS EYES AS IF UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE MIGHT NOT JOIN IN MY
MIRTH WHETHER IT WERE NOT PLEASANT FAMILIARITY OR WHAT IT REALLY WAS
CONTEMPT
I SETTLED HIS DOUBTS BY SUDDENLY RETRIEVING MY GRAVITY AND
DESIRING HIM TO WALK AWAY FOR I CAME TO SEE LINTON NOT HIM
HE
REDDENED I SAW THAT BY THE MOONLIGHT DROPPED HIS HAND FROM THE LATCH
AND SKULKED OFF A PICTURE OF MORTIFIED VANITY
HE IMAGINED HIMSELF TO
BE AS ACCOMPLISHED AS LINTON I SUPPOSE BECAUSE HE COULD SPELL HIS OWN
NAME AND WAS MARVELLOUSLY DISCOMFITED THAT I DIDN'T THINK THE SAME
'STOP MISS CATHERINE DEAR I INTERRUPTED
'I SHALL NOT SCOLD BUT I
DON'T LIKE YOUR CONDUCT THERE
IF YOU HAD REMEMBERED THAT HARETON WAS
YOUR COUSIN AS MUCH AS MASTER HEATHCLIFF YOU WOULD HAVE FELT HOW
IMPROPER IT WAS TO BEHAVE IN THAT WAY
AT LEAST IT WAS PRAISEWORTHY
AMBITION FOR HIM TO DESIRE TO BE AS ACCOMPLISHED AS LINTON AND PROBABLY
HE DID NOT LEARN MERELY TO SHOW OFF YOU HAD MADE HIM ASHAMED OF HIS
IGNORANCE BEFORE I HAVE NO DOUBT AND HE WISHED TO REMEDY IT AND PLEASE
YOU
TO SNEER AT HIS IMPERFECT ATTEMPT WAS VERY BAD BREEDING
HAD YOU
BEEN BROUGHT UP IN HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD YOU BE LESS RUDE HE WAS AS
QUICK AND AS INTELLIGENT A CHILD AS EVER YOU WERE AND I'M HURT THAT HE
SHOULD BE DESPISED NOW BECAUSE THAT BASE HEATHCLIFF HAS TREATED HIM SO
UNJUSTLY
'WELL ELLEN YOU WON'T CRY ABOUT IT WILL YOU SHE EXCLAIMED SURPRISED
AT MY EARNESTNESS
'BUT WAIT AND YOU SHALL HEAR IF HE CONNED HIS A B C
TO PLEASE ME AND IF IT WERE WORTH WHILE BEING CIVIL TO THE BRUTE
I
ENTERED LINTON WAS LYING ON THE SETTLE AND HALF GOT UP TO WELCOME ME
I'M ILL TO NIGHT CATHERINE LOVE HE SAID AND YOU MUST HAVE ALL THE
TALK AND LET ME LISTEN
COME AND SIT BY ME
I WAS SURE YOU WOULDN'T
BREAK YOUR WORD AND I'LL MAKE YOU PROMISE AGAIN BEFORE YOU GO
'I KNEW NOW THAT I MUSTN'T TEASE HIM AS HE WAS ILL AND I SPOKE SOFTLY
AND PUT NO QUESTIONS AND AVOIDED IRRITATING HIM IN ANY WAY
I HAD
BROUGHT SOME OF MY NICEST BOOKS FOR HIM HE ASKED ME TO READ A LITTLE OF
ONE AND I WAS ABOUT TO COMPLY WHEN EARNSHAW BURST THE DOOR OPEN HAVING
GATHERED VENOM WITH REFLECTION
HE ADVANCED DIRECT TO US SEIZED LINTON
BY THE ARM AND SWUNG HIM OFF THE SEAT
GET TO THY OWN ROOM HE SAID IN A VOICE ALMOST INARTICULATE WITH
PASSION AND HIS FACE LOOKED SWELLED AND FURIOUS
TAKE HER THERE IF SHE
COMES TO SEE THEE THOU SHALLN'T KEEP ME OUT OF THIS
BEGONE WI' YE
BOTH
'HE SWORE AT US AND LEFT LINTON NO TIME TO ANSWER NEARLY THROWING HIM
INTO THE KITCHEN AND HE CLENCHED HIS FIST AS I FOLLOWED SEEMINGLY
LONGING TO KNOCK ME DOWN
I WAS AFRAID FOR A MOMENT AND I LET ONE
VOLUME FALL HE KICKED IT AFTER ME AND SHUT US OUT
I HEARD A
MALIGNANT CRACKLY LAUGH BY THE FIRE AND TURNING BEHELD THAT ODIOUS
JOSEPH STANDING RUBBING HIS BONY HANDS AND QUIVERING
I WER SURE HE'D SARVE YE OUT HE'S A GRAND LAD HE'S GETTEN T' RAIGHT
SPERRIT IN HIM HE KNAWS AY HE KNAWS AS WEEL AS I DO WHO SUD BE T'
MAISTER YONDER ECH ECH ECH HE MADE YE SKIFT PROPERLY ECH ECH
ECH
WHERE MUST WE GO I ASKED OF MY COUSIN DISREGARDING THE OLD WRETCH'S
MOCKERY
'LINTON WAS WHITE AND TREMBLING
HE WAS NOT PRETTY THEN ELLEN OH NO
HE LOOKED FRIGHTFUL FOR HIS THIN FACE AND LARGE EYES WERE WROUGHT INTO
AN EXPRESSION OF FRANTIC POWERLESS FURY
HE GRASPED THE HANDLE OF THE
DOOR AND SHOOK IT IT WAS FASTENED INSIDE
IF YOU DON'T LET ME IN I'LL KILL YOU IF YOU DON'T LET ME IN I'LL
KILL YOU HE RATHER SHRIEKED THAN SAID
DEVIL DEVIL I'LL KILL
YOU I'LL KILL YOU
JOSEPH UTTERED HIS CROAKING LAUGH AGAIN
THEAR THAT'S T' FATHER HE CRIED
THAT'S FATHER WE'VE ALLAS
SUMMUT O' EITHER SIDE IN US
NIVER HEED HARETON LAD DUNNUT BE
'FEARD HE CANNOT GET AT THEE
'I TOOK HOLD OF LINTON'S HANDS AND TRIED TO PULL HIM AWAY BUT HE
SHRIEKED SO SHOCKINGLY THAT I DARED NOT PROCEED
AT LAST HIS CRIES WERE
CHOKED BY A DREADFUL FIT OF COUGHING BLOOD GUSHED FROM HIS MOUTH AND HE
FELL ON THE GROUND
I RAN INTO THE YARD SICK WITH TERROR AND CALLED
FOR ZILLAH AS LOUD AS I COULD
SHE SOON HEARD ME SHE WAS MILKING THE
COWS IN A SHED BEHIND THE BARN AND HURRYING FROM HER WORK SHE INQUIRED
WHAT THERE WAS TO DO I HADN'T BREATH TO EXPLAIN DRAGGING HER IN I
LOOKED ABOUT FOR LINTON
EARNSHAW HAD COME OUT TO EXAMINE THE MISCHIEF
HE HAD CAUSED AND HE WAS THEN CONVEYING THE POOR THING UP STAIRS
ZILLAH
AND I ASCENDED AFTER HIM BUT HE STOPPED ME AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND
SAID I SHOULDN'T GO IN I MUST GO HOME
I EXCLAIMED THAT HE HAD KILLED
LINTON AND I WOULD ENTER
JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR AND DECLARED I
SHOULD DO NO SICH STUFF AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WERE BAHN TO BE AS MAD
AS HIM I STOOD CRYING TILL THE HOUSEKEEPER REAPPEARED
SHE AFFIRMED
HE WOULD BE BETTER IN A BIT BUT HE COULDN'T DO WITH THAT SHRIEKING AND
DIN AND SHE TOOK ME AND NEARLY CARRIED ME INTO THE HOUSE
'ELLEN I WAS READY TO TEAR MY HAIR OFF MY HEAD I SOBBED AND WEPT SO
THAT MY EYES WERE ALMOST BLIND AND THE RUFFIAN YOU HAVE SUCH SYMPATHY
WITH STOOD OPPOSITE PRESUMING EVERY NOW AND THEN TO BID ME WISHT AND
DENYING THAT IT WAS HIS FAULT AND FINALLY FRIGHTENED BY MY ASSERTIONS
THAT I WOULD TELL PAPA AND THAT HE SHOULD BE PUT IN PRISON AND HANGED
HE COMMENCED BLUBBERING HIMSELF AND HURRIED OUT TO HIDE HIS COWARDLY
AGITATION
STILL I WAS NOT RID OF HIM WHEN AT LENGTH THEY COMPELLED ME
TO DEPART AND I HAD GOT SOME HUNDRED YARDS OFF THE PREMISES HE SUDDENLY
ISSUED FROM THE SHADOW OF THE ROAD SIDE AND CHECKED MINNY AND TOOK HOLD
OF ME
MISS CATHERINE I'M ILL GRIEVED HE BEGAN BUT IT'S RAYTHER TOO BAD
'I GAVE HIM A CUT WITH MY WHIP THINKING PERHAPS HE WOULD MURDER ME
HE
LET GO THUNDERING ONE OF HIS HORRID CURSES AND I GALLOPED HOME MORE
THAN HALF OUT OF MY SENSES
'I DIDN'T BID YOU GOOD NIGHT THAT EVENING AND I DIDN'T GO TO WUTHERING
HEIGHTS THE NEXT I WISHED TO GO EXCEEDINGLY BUT I WAS STRANGELY
EXCITED AND DREADED TO HEAR THAT LINTON WAS DEAD SOMETIMES AND
SOMETIMES SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT OF ENCOUNTERING HARETON
ON THE THIRD
DAY I TOOK COURAGE AT LEAST I COULDN'T BEAR LONGER SUSPENSE AND STOLE
OFF ONCE MORE
I WENT AT FIVE O'CLOCK AND WALKED FANCYING I MIGHT
MANAGE TO CREEP INTO THE HOUSE AND UP TO LINTON'S ROOM UNOBSERVED
HOWEVER THE DOGS GAVE NOTICE OF MY APPROACH
ZILLAH RECEIVED ME AND
SAYING THE LAD WAS MENDING NICELY SHOWED ME INTO A SMALL TIDY
CARPETED APARTMENT WHERE TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY I BEHELD LINTON LAID
ON A LITTLE SOFA READING ONE OF MY BOOKS
BUT HE WOULD NEITHER SPEAK TO
ME NOR LOOK AT ME THROUGH A WHOLE HOUR ELLEN HE HAS SUCH AN UNHAPPY
TEMPER
AND WHAT QUITE CONFOUNDED ME WHEN HE DID OPEN HIS MOUTH IT WAS
TO UTTER THE FALSEHOOD THAT I HAD OCCASIONED THE UPROAR AND HARETON WAS
NOT TO BLAME UNABLE TO REPLY EXCEPT PASSIONATELY I GOT UP AND WALKED
FROM THE ROOM
HE SENT AFTER ME A FAINT CATHERINE HE DID NOT RECKON
ON BEING ANSWERED SO BUT I WOULDN'T TURN BACK AND THE MORROW WAS THE
SECOND DAY ON WHICH I STAYED AT HOME NEARLY DETERMINED TO VISIT HIM NO
MORE
BUT IT WAS SO MISERABLE GOING TO BED AND GETTING UP AND NEVER
HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT HIM THAT MY RESOLUTION MELTED INTO AIR BEFORE IT
WAS PROPERLY FORMED
IT HAD APPEARED WRONG TO TAKE THE JOURNEY ONCE NOW
IT SEEMED WRONG TO REFRAIN
MICHAEL CAME TO ASK IF HE MUST SADDLE MINNY
I SAID YES AND CONSIDERED MYSELF DOING A DUTY AS SHE BORE ME OVER THE
HILLS
I WAS FORCED TO PASS THE FRONT WINDOWS TO GET TO THE COURT IT
WAS NO USE TRYING TO CONCEAL MY PRESENCE
YOUNG MASTER IS IN THE HOUSE SAID ZILLAH AS SHE SAW ME MAKING FOR
THE PARLOUR
I WENT IN EARNSHAW WAS THERE ALSO BUT HE QUITTED THE ROOM
DIRECTLY
LINTON SAT IN THE GREAT ARM CHAIR HALF ASLEEP WALKING UP TO
THE FIRE I BEGAN IN A SERIOUS TONE PARTLY MEANING IT TO BE TRUE
AS YOU DON'T LIKE ME LINTON AND AS YOU THINK I COME ON PURPOSE TO
HURT YOU AND PRETEND THAT I DO SO EVERY TIME THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING
LET US SAY GOOD BYE AND TELL MR
HEATHCLIFF THAT YOU HAVE NO WISH TO SEE
ME AND THAT HE MUSTN'T INVENT ANY MORE FALSEHOODS ON THE SUBJECT
SIT DOWN AND TAKE YOUR HAT OFF CATHERINE HE ANSWERED
YOU ARE SO
MUCH HAPPIER THAN I AM YOU OUGHT TO BE BETTER
PAPA TALKS ENOUGH OF MY
DEFECTS AND SHOWS ENOUGH SCORN OF ME TO MAKE IT NATURAL I SHOULD DOUBT
MYSELF
I DOUBT WHETHER I AM NOT ALTOGETHER AS WORTHLESS AS HE CALLS ME
FREQUENTLY AND THEN I FEEL SO CROSS AND BITTER I HATE EVERYBODY I AM
WORTHLESS AND BAD IN TEMPER AND BAD IN SPIRIT ALMOST ALWAYS AND IF
YOU CHOOSE YOU MAY SAY GOOD BYE YOU'LL GET RID OF AN ANNOYANCE
ONLY
CATHERINE DO ME THIS JUSTICE BELIEVE THAT IF I MIGHT BE AS SWEET AND
AS KIND AND AS GOOD AS YOU ARE I WOULD BE AS WILLINGLY AND MORE SO
THAN AS HAPPY AND AS HEALTHY
AND BELIEVE THAT YOUR KINDNESS HAS MADE ME
LOVE YOU DEEPER THAN IF I DESERVED YOUR LOVE AND THOUGH I COULDN'T AND
CANNOT HELP SHOWING MY NATURE TO YOU I REGRET IT AND REPENT IT AND
SHALL REGRET AND REPENT IT TILL I DIE
'I FELT HE SPOKE THE TRUTH AND I FELT I MUST FORGIVE HIM AND THOUGH WE
SHOULD QUARREL THE NEXT MOMENT I MUST FORGIVE HIM AGAIN
WE WERE
RECONCILED BUT WE CRIED BOTH OF US THE WHOLE TIME I STAYED NOT
ENTIRELY FOR SORROW YET I WAS SORRY LINTON HAD THAT DISTORTED NATURE
HE'LL NEVER LET HIS FRIENDS BE AT EASE AND HE'LL NEVER BE AT EASE
HIMSELF I HAVE ALWAYS GONE TO HIS LITTLE PARLOUR SINCE THAT NIGHT
BECAUSE HIS FATHER RETURNED THE DAY AFTER
'ABOUT THREE TIMES I THINK WE HAVE BEEN MERRY AND HOPEFUL AS WE WERE
THE FIRST EVENING THE REST OF MY VISITS WERE DREARY AND TROUBLED NOW
WITH HIS SELFISHNESS AND SPITE AND NOW WITH HIS SUFFERINGS BUT I'VE
LEARNED TO ENDURE THE FORMER WITH NEARLY AS LITTLE RESENTMENT AS THE
LATTER
MR
HEATHCLIFF PURPOSELY AVOIDS ME I HAVE HARDLY SEEN HIM AT
ALL
LAST SUNDAY INDEED COMING EARLIER THAN USUAL I HEARD HIM ABUSING
POOR LINTON CRUELLY FOR HIS CONDUCT OF THE NIGHT BEFORE
I CAN'T TELL
HOW HE KNEW OF IT UNLESS HE LISTENED
LINTON HAD CERTAINLY BEHAVED
PROVOKINGLY HOWEVER IT WAS THE BUSINESS OF NOBODY BUT ME AND I
INTERRUPTED MR
HEATHCLIFF'S LECTURE BY ENTERING AND TELLING HIM SO
HE
BURST INTO A LAUGH AND WENT AWAY SAYING HE WAS GLAD I TOOK THAT VIEW OF
THE MATTER
SINCE THEN I'VE TOLD LINTON HE MUST WHISPER HIS BITTER
THINGS
NOW ELLEN YOU HAVE HEARD ALL
I CAN'T BE PREVENTED FROM GOING
TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS EXCEPT BY INFLICTING MISERY ON TWO PEOPLE WHEREAS
IF YOU'LL ONLY NOT TELL PAPA MY GOING NEED DISTURB THE TRANQUILLITY OF
NONE
YOU'LL NOT TELL WILL YOU IT WILL BE VERY HEARTLESS IF YOU DO
'I'LL MAKE UP MY MIND ON THAT POINT BY TO MORROW MISS CATHERINE I
REPLIED
'IT REQUIRES SOME STUDY AND SO I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR REST
AND GO THINK IT OVER
I THOUGHT IT OVER ALOUD IN MY MASTER'S PRESENCE WALKING STRAIGHT FROM
HER ROOM TO HIS AND RELATING THE WHOLE STORY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HER
CONVERSATIONS WITH HER COUSIN AND ANY MENTION OF HARETON
MR
LINTON
WAS ALARMED AND DISTRESSED MORE THAN HE WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE TO ME
IN THE
MORNING CATHERINE LEARNT MY BETRAYAL OF HER CONFIDENCE AND SHE LEARNT
ALSO THAT HER SECRET VISITS WERE TO END
IN VAIN SHE WEPT AND WRITHED
AGAINST THE INTERDICT AND IMPLORED HER FATHER TO HAVE PITY ON LINTON
ALL SHE GOT TO COMFORT HER WAS A PROMISE THAT HE WOULD WRITE AND GIVE HIM
LEAVE TO COME TO THE GRANGE WHEN HE PLEASED BUT EXPLAINING THAT HE MUST
NO LONGER EXPECT TO SEE CATHERINE AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS
PERHAPS HAD HE
BEEN AWARE OF HIS NEPHEW'S DISPOSITION AND STATE OF HEALTH HE WOULD HAVE
SEEN FIT TO WITHHOLD EVEN THAT SLIGHT CONSOLATION
CHAPTER XXV
'THESE THINGS HAPPENED LAST WINTER SIR SAID MRS
DEAN 'HARDLY MORE
THAN A YEAR AGO
LAST WINTER I DID NOT THINK AT ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS'
END I SHOULD BE AMUSING A STRANGER TO THE FAMILY WITH RELATING THEM
YET WHO KNOWS HOW LONG YOU'LL BE A STRANGER YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO REST
ALWAYS CONTENTED LIVING BY YOURSELF AND I SOME WAY FANCY NO ONE COULD
SEE CATHERINE LINTON AND NOT LOVE HER
YOU SMILE BUT WHY DO YOU LOOK SO
LIVELY AND INTERESTED WHEN I TALK ABOUT HER AND WHY HAVE YOU ASKED ME TO
HANG HER PICTURE OVER YOUR FIREPLACE AND WHY
'STOP MY GOOD FRIEND I CRIED
'IT MAY BE VERY POSSIBLE THAT I
SHOULD LOVE HER BUT WOULD SHE LOVE ME I DOUBT IT TOO MUCH TO VENTURE
MY TRANQUILLITY BY RUNNING INTO TEMPTATION AND THEN MY HOME IS NOT HERE
I'M OF THE BUSY WORLD AND TO ITS ARMS I MUST RETURN
GO ON
WAS
CATHERINE OBEDIENT TO HER FATHER'S COMMANDS
'SHE WAS CONTINUED THE HOUSEKEEPER
'HER AFFECTION FOR HIM WAS STILL
THE CHIEF SENTIMENT IN HER HEART AND HE SPOKE WITHOUT ANGER HE SPOKE IN
THE DEEP TENDERNESS OF ONE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIS TREASURE AMID PERILS AND
FOES WHERE HIS REMEMBERED WORDS WOULD BE THE ONLY AID THAT HE COULD
BEQUEATH TO GUIDE HER
HE SAID TO ME A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS I WISH MY
NEPHEW WOULD WRITE ELLEN OR CALL
TELL ME SINCERELY WHAT YOU THINK
OF HIM IS HE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER OR IS THERE A PROSPECT OF
IMPROVEMENT AS HE GROWS A MAN
HE'S VERY DELICATE SIR I REPLIED AND SCARCELY LIKELY TO REACH
MANHOOD BUT THIS I CAN SAY HE DOES NOT RESEMBLE HIS FATHER AND IF MISS
CATHERINE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO MARRY HIM HE WOULD NOT BE BEYOND HER
CONTROL UNLESS SHE WERE EXTREMELY AND FOOLISHLY INDULGENT
HOWEVER
MASTER YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HIM AND SEE
WHETHER HE WOULD SUIT HER IT WANTS FOUR YEARS AND MORE TO HIS BEING OF
AGE
EDGAR SIGHED AND WALKING TO THE WINDOW LOOKED OUT TOWARDS GIMMERTON
KIRK
IT WAS A MISTY AFTERNOON BUT THE FEBRUARY SUN SHONE DIMLY AND WE
COULD JUST DISTINGUISH THE TWO FIR TREES IN THE YARD AND THE
SPARELY SCATTERED GRAVESTONES
'I'VE PRAYED OFTEN HE HALF SOLILOQUISED 'FOR THE APPROACH OF WHAT IS
COMING AND NOW I BEGIN TO SHRINK AND FEAR IT
I THOUGHT THE MEMORY OF
THE HOUR I CAME DOWN THAT GLEN A BRIDEGROOM WOULD BE LESS SWEET THAN THE
ANTICIPATION THAT I WAS SOON IN A FEW MONTHS OR POSSIBLY WEEKS TO BE
CARRIED UP AND LAID IN ITS LONELY HOLLOW ELLEN I'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY
WITH MY LITTLE CATHY THROUGH WINTER NIGHTS AND SUMMER DAYS SHE WAS A
LIVING HOPE AT MY SIDE
BUT I'VE BEEN AS HAPPY MUSING BY MYSELF AMONG
THOSE STONES UNDER THAT OLD CHURCH LYING THROUGH THE LONG JUNE
EVENINGS ON THE GREEN MOUND OF HER MOTHER'S GRAVE AND WISHING YEARNING
FOR THE TIME WHEN I MIGHT LIE BENEATH IT
WHAT CAN I DO FOR CATHY HOW
MUST I QUIT HER I'D NOT CARE ONE MOMENT FOR LINTON BEING HEATHCLIFF'S
SON NOR FOR HIS TAKING HER FROM ME IF HE COULD CONSOLE HER FOR MY LOSS
I'D NOT CARE THAT HEATHCLIFF GAINED HIS ENDS AND TRIUMPHED IN ROBBING ME
OF MY LAST BLESSING BUT SHOULD LINTON BE UNWORTHY ONLY A FEEBLE TOOL
TO HIS FATHER I CANNOT ABANDON HER TO HIM AND HARD THOUGH IT BE TO
CRUSH HER BUOYANT SPIRIT I MUST PERSEVERE IN MAKING HER SAD WHILE I
LIVE AND LEAVING HER SOLITARY WHEN I DIE
DARLING I'D RATHER RESIGN
HER TO GOD AND LAY HER IN THE EARTH BEFORE ME
'RESIGN HER TO GOD AS IT IS SIR I ANSWERED 'AND IF WE SHOULD LOSE
YOU WHICH MAY HE FORBID UNDER HIS PROVIDENCE I'LL STAND HER FRIEND AND
COUNSELLOR TO THE LAST
MISS CATHERINE IS A GOOD GIRL I DON'T FEAR THAT
SHE WILL GO WILFULLY WRONG AND PEOPLE WHO DO THEIR DUTY ARE ALWAYS
FINALLY REWARDED
SPRING ADVANCED YET MY MASTER GATHERED NO REAL STRENGTH THOUGH HE
RESUMED HIS WALKS IN THE GROUNDS WITH HIS DAUGHTER
TO HER INEXPERIENCED
NOTIONS THIS ITSELF WAS A SIGN OF CONVALESCENCE AND THEN HIS CHEEK WAS
OFTEN FLUSHED AND HIS EYES WERE BRIGHT SHE FELT SURE OF HIS RECOVERING
ON HER SEVENTEENTH BIRTHDAY HE DID NOT VISIT THE CHURCHYARD IT WAS
RAINING AND I OBSERVED 'YOU'LL SURELY NOT GO OUT TO NIGHT SIR
HE ANSWERED 'NO I'LL DEFER IT THIS YEAR A LITTLE LONGER HE WROTE
AGAIN TO LINTON EXPRESSING HIS GREAT DESIRE TO SEE HIM AND HAD THE
INVALID BEEN PRESENTABLE I'VE NO DOUBT HIS FATHER WOULD HAVE PERMITTED
HIM TO COME
AS IT WAS BEING INSTRUCTED HE RETURNED AN ANSWER
INTIMATING THAT MR
HEATHCLIFF OBJECTED TO HIS CALLING AT THE GRANGE BUT
HIS UNCLE'S KIND REMEMBRANCE DELIGHTED HIM AND HE HOPED TO MEET HIM
SOMETIMES IN HIS RAMBLES AND PERSONALLY TO PETITION THAT HIS COUSIN AND
HE MIGHT NOT REMAIN LONG SO UTTERLY DIVIDED
THAT PART OF HIS LETTER WAS SIMPLE AND PROBABLY HIS OWN
HEATHCLIFF
KNEW HE COULD PLEAD ELOQUENTLY FOR CATHERINE'S COMPANY THEN
'I DO NOT ASK HE SAID 'THAT SHE MAY VISIT HERE BUT AM I NEVER TO SEE
HER BECAUSE MY FATHER FORBIDS ME TO GO TO HER HOME AND YOU FORBID HER
TO COME TO MINE DO NOW AND THEN RIDE WITH HER TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS
AND LET US EXCHANGE A FEW WORDS IN YOUR PRESENCE WE HAVE DONE NOTHING
TO DESERVE THIS SEPARATION AND YOU ARE NOT ANGRY WITH ME YOU HAVE NO
REASON TO DISLIKE ME YOU ALLOW YOURSELF
DEAR UNCLE SEND ME A KIND
NOTE TO MORROW AND LEAVE TO JOIN YOU ANYWHERE YOU PLEASE EXCEPT AT
THRUSHCROSS GRANGE
I BELIEVE AN INTERVIEW WOULD CONVINCE YOU THAT MY
FATHER'S CHARACTER IS NOT MINE HE AFFIRMS I AM MORE YOUR NEPHEW THAN HIS
SON AND THOUGH I HAVE FAULTS WHICH RENDER ME UNWORTHY OF CATHERINE SHE
HAS EXCUSED THEM AND FOR HER SAKE YOU SHOULD ALSO
YOU INQUIRE AFTER
MY HEALTH IT IS BETTER BUT WHILE I REMAIN CUT OFF FROM ALL HOPE AND
DOOMED TO SOLITUDE OR THE SOCIETY OF THOSE WHO NEVER DID AND NEVER WILL
LIKE ME HOW CAN I BE CHEERFUL AND WELL
EDGAR THOUGH HE FELT FOR THE BOY COULD NOT CONSENT TO GRANT HIS
REQUEST BECAUSE HE COULD NOT ACCOMPANY CATHERINE
HE SAID IN SUMMER
PERHAPS THEY MIGHT MEET MEANTIME HE WISHED HIM TO CONTINUE WRITING AT
INTERVALS AND ENGAGED TO GIVE HIM WHAT ADVICE AND COMFORT HE WAS ABLE BY
LETTER BEING WELL AWARE OF HIS HARD POSITION IN HIS FAMILY
LINTON
COMPLIED AND HAD HE BEEN UNRESTRAINED WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SPOILED ALL
BY FILLING HIS EPISTLES WITH COMPLAINTS AND LAMENTATIONS BUT HIS FATHER
KEPT A SHARP WATCH OVER HIM AND OF COURSE INSISTED ON EVERY LINE THAT
MY MASTER SENT BEING SHOWN SO INSTEAD OF PENNING HIS PECULIAR PERSONAL
SUFFERINGS AND DISTRESSES THE THEMES CONSTANTLY UPPERMOST IN HIS
THOUGHTS HE HARPED ON THE CRUEL OBLIGATION OF BEING HELD ASUNDER FROM
HIS FRIEND AND LOVE AND GENTLY INTIMATED THAT MR
LINTON MUST ALLOW AN
INTERVIEW SOON OR HE SHOULD FEAR HE WAS PURPOSELY DECEIVING HIM WITH
EMPTY PROMISES
CATHY WAS A POWERFUL ALLY AT HOME AND BETWEEN THEM THEY AT LENGTH
PERSUADED MY MASTER TO ACQUIESCE IN THEIR HAVING A RIDE OR A WALK
TOGETHER ABOUT ONCE A WEEK UNDER MY GUARDIANSHIP AND ON THE MOORS
NEAREST THE GRANGE FOR JUNE FOUND HIM STILL DECLINING
THOUGH HE HAD
SET ASIDE YEARLY A PORTION OF HIS INCOME FOR MY YOUNG LADY'S FORTUNE HE
HAD A NATURAL DESIRE THAT SHE MIGHT RETAIN OR AT LEAST RETURN IN A SHORT
TIME TO THE HOUSE OF HER ANCESTORS AND HE CONSIDERED HER ONLY PROSPECT
OF DOING THAT WAS BY A UNION WITH HIS HEIR HE HAD NO IDEA THAT THE
LATTER WAS FAILING ALMOST AS FAST AS HIMSELF NOR HAD ANY ONE I BELIEVE
NO DOCTOR VISITED THE HEIGHTS AND NO ONE SAW MASTER HEATHCLIFF TO MAKE
REPORT OF HIS CONDITION AMONG US
I FOR MY PART BEGAN TO FANCY MY
FOREBODINGS WERE FALSE AND THAT HE MUST BE ACTUALLY RALLYING WHEN HE
MENTIONED RIDING AND WALKING ON THE MOORS AND SEEMED SO EARNEST IN
PURSUING HIS OBJECT
I COULD NOT PICTURE A FATHER TREATING A DYING CHILD
AS TYRANNICALLY AND WICKEDLY AS I AFTERWARDS LEARNED HEATHCLIFF HAD
TREATED HIM TO COMPEL THIS APPARENT EAGERNESS HIS EFFORTS REDOUBLING
THE MORE IMMINENTLY HIS AVARICIOUS AND UNFEELING PLANS WERE THREATENED
WITH DEFEAT BY DEATH
CHAPTER XXVI
SUMMER WAS ALREADY PAST ITS PRIME WHEN EDGAR RELUCTANTLY YIELDED HIS
ASSENT TO THEIR ENTREATIES AND CATHERINE AND I SET OUT ON OUR FIRST RIDE
TO JOIN HER COUSIN
IT WAS A CLOSE SULTRY DAY DEVOID OF SUNSHINE BUT
WITH A SKY TOO DAPPLED AND HAZY TO THREATEN RAIN AND OUR PLACE OF
MEETING HAD BEEN FIXED AT THE GUIDE STONE BY THE CROSS ROADS
ON
ARRIVING THERE HOWEVER A LITTLE HERD BOY DESPATCHED AS A MESSENGER
TOLD US THAT 'MAISTER LINTON WER JUST O' THIS SIDE TH' HEIGHTS AND
HE'D BE MITCH OBLEEGED TO US TO GANG ON A BIT FURTHER
'THEN MASTER LINTON HAS FORGOT THE FIRST INJUNCTION OF HIS UNCLE I
OBSERVED 'HE BID US KEEP ON THE GRANGE LAND AND HERE WE ARE OFF AT
ONCE
'WELL WE'LL TURN OUR HORSES' HEADS ROUND WHEN WE REACH HIM ANSWERED MY
COMPANION 'OUR EXCURSION SHALL LIE TOWARDS HOME
BUT WHEN WE REACHED HIM AND THAT WAS SCARCELY A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM
HIS OWN DOOR WE FOUND HE HAD NO HORSE AND WE WERE FORCED TO DISMOUNT
AND LEAVE OURS TO GRAZE
HE LAY ON THE HEATH AWAITING OUR APPROACH AND
DID NOT RISE TILL WE CAME WITHIN A FEW YARDS
THEN HE WALKED SO FEEBLY
AND LOOKED SO PALE THAT I IMMEDIATELY EXCLAIMED 'WHY MASTER
HEATHCLIFF YOU ARE NOT FIT FOR ENJOYING A RAMBLE THIS MORNING
HOW ILL
YOU DO LOOK
CATHERINE SURVEYED HIM WITH GRIEF AND ASTONISHMENT SHE CHANGED THE
EJACULATION OF JOY ON HER LIPS TO ONE OF ALARM AND THE CONGRATULATION ON
THEIR LONG POSTPONED MEETING TO AN ANXIOUS INQUIRY WHETHER HE WERE WORSE
THAN USUAL
'NO BETTER BETTER HE PANTED TREMBLING AND RETAINING HER HAND AS IF
HE NEEDED ITS SUPPORT WHILE HIS LARGE BLUE EYES WANDERED TIMIDLY OVER
HER THE HOLLOWNESS ROUND THEM TRANSFORMING TO HAGGARD WILDNESS THE
LANGUID EXPRESSION THEY ONCE POSSESSED
'BUT YOU HAVE BEEN WORSE PERSISTED HIS COUSIN 'WORSE THAN WHEN I SAW
YOU LAST YOU ARE THINNER AND
'I'M TIRED HE INTERRUPTED HURRIEDLY
'IT IS TOO HOT FOR WALKING LET
US REST HERE
AND IN THE MORNING I OFTEN FEEL SICK PAPA SAYS I GROW
SO FAST
BADLY SATISFIED CATHY SAT DOWN AND HE RECLINED BESIDE HER
'THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE YOUR PARADISE SAID SHE MAKING AN EFFORT AT
CHEERFULNESS
'YOU RECOLLECT THE TWO DAYS WE AGREED TO SPEND IN THE
PLACE AND WAY EACH THOUGHT PLEASANTEST THIS IS NEARLY YOURS ONLY THERE
ARE CLOUDS BUT THEN THEY ARE SO SOFT AND MELLOW IT IS NICER THAN
SUNSHINE
NEXT WEEK IF YOU CAN WE'LL RIDE DOWN TO THE GRANGE PARK AND
TRY MINE
LINTON DID NOT APPEAR TO REMEMBER WHAT SHE TALKED OF AND HE HAD EVIDENTLY
GREAT DIFFICULTY IN SUSTAINING ANY KIND OF CONVERSATION
HIS LACK OF
INTEREST IN THE SUBJECTS SHE STARTED AND HIS EQUAL INCAPACITY TO
CONTRIBUTE TO HER ENTERTAINMENT WERE SO OBVIOUS THAT SHE COULD NOT
CONCEAL HER DISAPPOINTMENT
AN INDEFINITE ALTERATION HAD COME OVER HIS
WHOLE PERSON AND MANNER
THE PETTISHNESS THAT MIGHT BE CARESSED INTO
FONDNESS HAD YIELDED TO A LISTLESS APATHY THERE WAS LESS OF THE PEEVISH
TEMPER OF A CHILD WHICH FRETS AND TEASES ON PURPOSE TO BE SOOTHED AND
MORE OF THE SELF ABSORBED MOROSENESS OF A CONFIRMED INVALID REPELLING
CONSOLATION AND READY TO REGARD THE GOOD HUMOURED MIRTH OF OTHERS AS AN
INSULT
CATHERINE PERCEIVED AS WELL AS I DID THAT HE HELD IT RATHER A
PUNISHMENT THAN A GRATIFICATION TO ENDURE OUR COMPANY AND SHE MADE NO
SCRUPLE OF PROPOSING PRESENTLY TO DEPART
THAT PROPOSAL UNEXPECTEDLY
ROUSED LINTON FROM HIS LETHARGY AND THREW HIM INTO A STRANGE STATE OF
AGITATION
HE GLANCED FEARFULLY TOWARDS THE HEIGHTS BEGGING SHE WOULD
REMAIN ANOTHER HALF HOUR AT LEAST
'BUT I THINK SAID CATHY 'YOU'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE AT HOME THAN
SITTING HERE AND I CANNOT AMUSE YOU TO DAY I SEE BY MY TALES AND
SONGS AND CHATTER YOU HAVE GROWN WISER THAN I IN THESE SIX MONTHS YOU
HAVE LITTLE TASTE FOR MY DIVERSIONS NOW OR ELSE IF I COULD AMUSE YOU
I'D WILLINGLY STAY
'STAY TO REST YOURSELF HE REPLIED
'AND CATHERINE DON'T THINK OR SAY
THAT I'M VERY UNWELL IT IS THE HEAVY WEATHER AND HEAT THAT MAKE ME
DULL AND I WALKED ABOUT BEFORE YOU CAME A GREAT DEAL FOR ME
TELL
UNCLE I'M IN TOLERABLE HEALTH WILL YOU
'I'LL TELL HIM THAT YOU SAY SO LINTON
I COULDN'T AFFIRM THAT YOU
ARE OBSERVED MY YOUNG LADY WONDERING AT HIS PERTINACIOUS ASSERTION OF
WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN UNTRUTH
'AND BE HERE AGAIN NEXT THURSDAY CONTINUED HE SHUNNING HER PUZZLED
GAZE
'AND GIVE HIM MY THANKS FOR PERMITTING YOU TO COME MY BEST
THANKS CATHERINE
AND AND IF YOU DID MEET MY FATHER AND HE ASKED
YOU ABOUT ME DON'T LEAD HIM TO SUPPOSE THAT I'VE BEEN EXTREMELY SILENT
AND STUPID DON'T LOOK SAD AND DOWNCAST AS YOU ARE DOING HE'LL BE
ANGRY
'I CARE NOTHING FOR HIS ANGER EXCLAIMED CATHY IMAGINING SHE WOULD BE
ITS OBJECT
'BUT I DO SAID HER COUSIN SHUDDERING
DON'T PROVOKE HIM AGAINST
ME CATHERINE FOR HE IS VERY HARD
'IS HE SEVERE TO YOU MASTER HEATHCLIFF I INQUIRED
'HAS HE GROWN
WEARY OF INDULGENCE AND PASSED FROM PASSIVE TO ACTIVE HATRED
LINTON LOOKED AT ME BUT DID NOT ANSWER AND AFTER KEEPING HER SEAT BY
HIS SIDE ANOTHER TEN MINUTES DURING WHICH HIS HEAD FELL DROWSILY ON HIS
BREAST AND HE UTTERED NOTHING EXCEPT SUPPRESSED MOANS OF EXHAUSTION OR
PAIN CATHY BEGAN TO SEEK SOLACE IN LOOKING FOR BILBERRIES AND SHARING
THE PRODUCE OF HER RESEARCHES WITH ME SHE DID NOT OFFER THEM TO HIM FOR
SHE SAW FURTHER NOTICE WOULD ONLY WEARY AND ANNOY
'IS IT HALF AN HOUR NOW ELLEN SHE WHISPERED IN MY EAR AT LAST
'I
CAN'T TELL WHY WE SHOULD STAY
HE'S ASLEEP AND PAPA WILL BE WANTING US
BACK
'WELL WE MUST NOT LEAVE HIM ASLEEP I ANSWERED 'WAIT TILL HE WAKES
AND BE PATIENT
YOU WERE MIGHTY EAGER TO SET OFF BUT YOUR LONGING TO
SEE POOR LINTON HAS SOON EVAPORATED
'WHY DID HE WISH TO SEE ME RETURNED CATHERINE
'IN HIS CROSSEST
HUMOURS FORMERLY I LIKED HIM BETTER THAN I DO IN HIS PRESENT CURIOUS
MOOD
IT'S JUST AS IF IT WERE A TASK HE WAS COMPELLED TO PERFORM THIS
INTERVIEW FOR FEAR HIS FATHER SHOULD SCOLD HIM
BUT I'M HARDLY GOING TO
COME TO GIVE MR
HEATHCLIFF PLEASURE WHATEVER REASON HE MAY HAVE FOR
ORDERING LINTON TO UNDERGO THIS PENANCE
AND THOUGH I'M GLAD HE'S
BETTER IN HEALTH I'M SORRY HE'S SO MUCH LESS PLEASANT AND SO MUCH LESS
AFFECTIONATE TO ME
'YOU THINK HE IS BETTER IN HEALTH THEN I SAID
'YES SHE ANSWERED 'BECAUSE HE ALWAYS MADE SUCH A GREAT DEAL OF HIS
SUFFERINGS YOU KNOW
HE IS NOT TOLERABLY WELL AS HE TOLD ME TO TELL
PAPA BUT HE'S BETTER VERY LIKELY
'THERE YOU DIFFER WITH ME MISS CATHY I REMARKED 'I SHOULD CONJECTURE
HIM TO BE FAR WORSE
LINTON HERE STARTED FROM HIS SLUMBER IN BEWILDERED TERROR AND ASKED IF
ANY ONE HAD CALLED HIS NAME
'NO SAID CATHERINE 'UNLESS IN DREAMS
I CANNOT CONCEIVE HOW YOU
MANAGE TO DOZE OUT OF DOORS IN THE MORNING
'I THOUGHT I HEARD MY FATHER HE GASPED GLANCING UP TO THE FROWNING NAB
ABOVE US
'YOU ARE SURE NOBODY SPOKE
'QUITE SURE REPLIED HIS COUSIN
'ONLY ELLEN AND I WERE DISPUTING
CONCERNING YOUR HEALTH
ARE YOU TRULY STRONGER LINTON THAN WHEN WE
SEPARATED IN WINTER IF YOU BE I'M CERTAIN ONE THING IS NOT
STRONGER YOUR REGARD FOR ME SPEAK ARE YOU
THE TEARS GUSHED FROM LINTON'S EYES AS HE ANSWERED 'YES YES I AM
AND STILL UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINARY VOICE HIS GAZE WANDERED UP
AND DOWN TO DETECT ITS OWNER
CATHY ROSE
'FOR TO DAY WE MUST PART SHE SAID
'AND I WON'T CONCEAL
THAT I HAVE BEEN SADLY DISAPPOINTED WITH OUR MEETING THOUGH I'LL MENTION
IT TO NOBODY BUT YOU NOT THAT I STAND IN AWE OF MR
HEATHCLIFF
'HUSH MURMURED LINTON 'FOR GOD'S SAKE HUSH HE'S COMING AND HE
CLUNG TO CATHERINE'S ARM STRIVING TO DETAIN HER BUT AT THAT
ANNOUNCEMENT SHE HASTILY DISENGAGED HERSELF AND WHISTLED TO MINNY WHO
OBEYED HER LIKE A DOG
'I'LL BE HERE NEXT THURSDAY SHE CRIED SPRINGING TO THE SADDLE
'GOOD BYE
QUICK ELLEN
AND SO WE LEFT HIM SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF OUR DEPARTURE SO ABSORBED WAS
HE IN ANTICIPATING HIS FATHER'S APPROACH
BEFORE WE REACHED HOME CATHERINE'S DISPLEASURE SOFTENED INTO A PERPLEXED
SENSATION OF PITY AND REGRET LARGELY BLENDED WITH VAGUE UNEASY DOUBTS
ABOUT LINTON'S ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL IN WHICH I
PARTOOK THOUGH I COUNSELLED HER NOT TO SAY MUCH FOR A SECOND JOURNEY
WOULD MAKE US BETTER JUDGES
MY MASTER REQUESTED AN ACCOUNT OF OUR
ONGOINGS
HIS NEPHEW'S OFFERING OF THANKS WAS DULY DELIVERED MISS CATHY
GENTLY TOUCHING ON THE REST I ALSO THREW LITTLE LIGHT ON HIS INQUIRIES
FOR I HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO HIDE AND WHAT TO REVEAL
CHAPTER XXVII
SEVEN DAYS GLIDED AWAY EVERY ONE MARKING ITS COURSE BY THE HENCEFORTH
RAPID ALTERATION OF EDGAR LINTON'S STATE
THE HAVOC THAT MONTHS HAD
PREVIOUSLY WROUGHT WAS NOW EMULATED BY THE INROADS OF HOURS
CATHERINE
WE WOULD FAIN HAVE DELUDED YET BUT HER OWN QUICK SPIRIT REFUSED TO
DELUDE HER IT DIVINED IN SECRET AND BROODED ON THE DREADFUL
PROBABILITY GRADUALLY RIPENING INTO CERTAINTY
SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO
MENTION HER RIDE WHEN THURSDAY CAME ROUND I MENTIONED IT FOR HER AND
OBTAINED PERMISSION TO ORDER HER OUT OF DOORS FOR THE LIBRARY WHERE HER
FATHER STOPPED A SHORT TIME DAILY THE BRIEF PERIOD HE COULD BEAR TO SIT
UP AND HIS CHAMBER HAD BECOME HER WHOLE WORLD
SHE GRUDGED EACH MOMENT
THAT DID NOT FIND HER BENDING OVER HIS PILLOW OR SEATED BY HIS SIDE
HER
COUNTENANCE GREW WAN WITH WATCHING AND SORROW AND MY MASTER GLADLY
DISMISSED HER TO WHAT HE FLATTERED HIMSELF WOULD BE A HAPPY CHANGE OF
SCENE AND SOCIETY DRAWING COMFORT FROM THE HOPE THAT SHE WOULD NOT NOW
BE LEFT ENTIRELY ALONE AFTER HIS DEATH
HE HAD A FIXED IDEA I GUESSED BY SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS HE LET FALL THAT
AS HIS NEPHEW RESEMBLED HIM IN PERSON HE WOULD RESEMBLE HIM IN MIND FOR
LINTON'S LETTERS BORE FEW OR NO INDICATIONS OF HIS DEFECTIVE CHARACTER
AND I THROUGH PARDONABLE WEAKNESS REFRAINED FROM CORRECTING THE ERROR
ASKING MYSELF WHAT GOOD THERE WOULD BE IN DISTURBING HIS LAST MOMENTS
WITH INFORMATION THAT HE HAD NEITHER POWER NOR OPPORTUNITY TO TURN TO
ACCOUNT
WE DEFERRED OUR EXCURSION TILL THE AFTERNOON A GOLDEN AFTERNOON OF
AUGUST EVERY BREATH FROM THE HILLS SO FULL OF LIFE THAT IT SEEMED
WHOEVER RESPIRED IT THOUGH DYING MIGHT REVIVE
CATHERINE'S FACE WAS
JUST LIKE THE LANDSCAPE SHADOWS AND SUNSHINE FLITTING OVER IT IN RAPID
SUCCESSION BUT THE SHADOWS RESTED LONGER AND THE SUNSHINE WAS MORE
TRANSIENT AND HER POOR LITTLE HEART REPROACHED ITSELF FOR EVEN THAT
PASSING FORGETFULNESS OF ITS CARES
WE DISCERNED LINTON WATCHING AT THE SAME SPOT HE HAD SELECTED BEFORE
MY
YOUNG MISTRESS ALIGHTED AND TOLD ME THAT AS SHE WAS RESOLVED TO STAY A
VERY LITTLE WHILE I HAD BETTER HOLD THE PONY AND REMAIN ON HORSEBACK
BUT I DISSENTED I WOULDN'T RISK LOSING SIGHT OF THE CHARGE COMMITTED TO
ME A MINUTE SO WE CLIMBED THE SLOPE OF HEATH TOGETHER
MASTER
HEATHCLIFF RECEIVED US WITH GREATER ANIMATION ON THIS OCCASION NOT THE
ANIMATION OF HIGH SPIRITS THOUGH NOR YET OF JOY IT LOOKED MORE LIKE
FEAR
'IT IS LATE HE SAID SPEAKING SHORT AND WITH DIFFICULTY
'IS NOT YOUR
FATHER VERY ILL I THOUGHT YOU WOULDN'T COME
WHY WON'T YOU BE CANDID CRIED CATHERINE SWALLOWING HER GREETING
'WHY CANNOT YOU SAY AT ONCE YOU DON'T WANT ME IT IS STRANGE LINTON
THAT FOR THE SECOND TIME YOU HAVE BROUGHT ME HERE ON PURPOSE APPARENTLY
TO DISTRESS US BOTH AND FOR NO REASON BESIDES
LINTON SHIVERED AND GLANCED AT HER HALF SUPPLICATING HALF ASHAMED BUT
HIS COUSIN'S PATIENCE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ENDURE THIS ENIGMATICAL
BEHAVIOUR
'MY FATHER IS VERY ILL SHE SAID 'AND WHY AM I CALLED FROM HIS
BEDSIDE WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND TO ABSOLVE ME FROM MY PROMISE WHEN YOU
WISHED I WOULDN'T KEEP IT COME I DESIRE AN EXPLANATION PLAYING AND
TRIFLING ARE COMPLETELY BANISHED OUT OF MY MIND AND I CAN'T DANCE
ATTENDANCE ON YOUR AFFECTATIONS NOW
'MY AFFECTATIONS HE MURMURED 'WHAT ARE THEY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE
CATHERINE DON'T LOOK SO ANGRY DESPISE ME AS MUCH AS YOU PLEASE I AM A
WORTHLESS COWARDLY WRETCH I CAN'T BE SCORNED ENOUGH BUT I'M TOO MEAN
FOR YOUR ANGER
HATE MY FATHER AND SPARE ME FOR CONTEMPT
'NONSENSE CRIED CATHERINE IN A PASSION
'FOOLISH SILLY BOY AND
THERE HE TREMBLES AS IF I WERE REALLY GOING TO TOUCH HIM YOU NEEDN'T
BESPEAK CONTEMPT LINTON ANYBODY WILL HAVE IT SPONTANEOUSLY AT YOUR
SERVICE
GET OFF I SHALL RETURN HOME IT IS FOLLY DRAGGING YOU FROM
THE HEARTH STONE AND PRETENDING WHAT DO WE PRETEND LET GO MY FROCK
IF I PITIED YOU FOR CRYING AND LOOKING SO VERY FRIGHTENED YOU SHOULD
SPURN SUCH PITY
ELLEN TELL HIM HOW DISGRACEFUL THIS CONDUCT IS
RISE
AND DON'T DEGRADE YOURSELF INTO AN ABJECT REPTILE DON'T
WITH STREAMING FACE AND AN EXPRESSION OF AGONY LINTON HAD THROWN HIS
NERVELESS FRAME ALONG THE GROUND HE SEEMED CONVULSED WITH EXQUISITE
TERROR
'OH HE SOBBED 'I CANNOT BEAR IT CATHERINE CATHERINE I'M A TRAITOR
TOO AND I DARE NOT TELL YOU BUT LEAVE ME AND I SHALL BE KILLED
DEAR CATHERINE MY LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS AND YOU HAVE SAID YOU LOVED
ME AND IF YOU DID IT WOULDN'T HARM YOU
YOU'LL NOT GO THEN KIND
SWEET GOOD CATHERINE AND PERHAPS YOU WILL CONSENT AND HE'LL LET ME
DIE WITH YOU
MY YOUNG LADY ON WITNESSING HIS INTENSE ANGUISH STOOPED TO RAISE HIM
THE OLD FEELING OF INDULGENT TENDERNESS OVERCAME HER VEXATION AND SHE
GREW THOROUGHLY MOVED AND ALARMED
'CONSENT TO WHAT SHE ASKED
'TO STAY TELL ME THE MEANING OF THIS
STRANGE TALK AND I WILL
YOU CONTRADICT YOUR OWN WORDS AND DISTRACT
ME BE CALM AND FRANK AND CONFESS AT ONCE ALL THAT WEIGHS ON YOUR
HEART
YOU WOULDN'T INJURE ME LINTON WOULD YOU YOU WOULDN'T LET ANY
ENEMY HURT ME IF YOU COULD PREVENT IT I'LL BELIEVE YOU ARE A COWARD
FOR YOURSELF BUT NOT A COWARDLY BETRAYER OF YOUR BEST FRIEND
'BUT MY FATHER THREATENED ME GASPED THE BOY CLASPING HIS ATTENUATED
FINGERS 'AND I DREAD HIM I DREAD HIM I DARE NOT TELL
'OH WELL SAID CATHERINE WITH SCORNFUL COMPASSION 'KEEP YOUR SECRET
I'M NO COWARD
SAVE YOURSELF I'M NOT AFRAID
HER MAGNANIMITY PROVOKED HIS TEARS HE WEPT WILDLY KISSING HER
SUPPORTING HANDS AND YET COULD NOT SUMMON COURAGE TO SPEAK OUT
I WAS
COGITATING WHAT THE MYSTERY MIGHT BE AND DETERMINED CATHERINE SHOULD
NEVER SUFFER TO BENEFIT HIM OR ANY ONE ELSE BY MY GOOD WILL WHEN
HEARING A RUSTLE AMONG THE LING I LOOKED UP AND SAW MR
HEATHCLIFF
ALMOST CLOSE UPON US DESCENDING THE HEIGHTS
HE DIDN'T CAST A GLANCE
TOWARDS MY COMPANIONS THOUGH THEY WERE SUFFICIENTLY NEAR FOR LINTON'S
SOBS TO BE AUDIBLE BUT HAILING ME IN THE ALMOST HEARTY TONE HE ASSUMED
TO NONE BESIDES AND THE SINCERITY OF WHICH I COULDN'T AVOID DOUBTING HE
SAID
'IT IS SOMETHING TO SEE YOU SO NEAR TO MY HOUSE NELLY
HOW ARE YOU AT
THE GRANGE LET US HEAR
THE RUMOUR GOES HE ADDED IN A LOWER TONE
'THAT EDGAR LINTON IS ON HIS DEATH BED PERHAPS THEY EXAGGERATE HIS
ILLNESS
'NO MY MASTER IS DYING I REPLIED 'IT IS TRUE ENOUGH
A SAD THING IT
WILL BE FOR US ALL BUT A BLESSING FOR HIM
'HOW LONG WILL HE LAST DO YOU THINK HE ASKED
'I DON'T KNOW I SAID
'BECAUSE HE CONTINUED LOOKING AT THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE FIXED
UNDER HIS EYE LINTON APPEARED AS IF HE COULD NOT VENTURE TO STIR OR
RAISE HIS HEAD AND CATHERINE COULD NOT MOVE ON HIS ACCOUNT 'BECAUSE
THAT LAD YONDER SEEMS DETERMINED TO BEAT ME AND I'D THANK HIS UNCLE TO
BE QUICK AND GO BEFORE HIM HALLO HAS THE WHELP BEEN PLAYING THAT GAME
LONG I DID GIVE HIM SOME LESSONS ABOUT SNIVELLING
IS HE PRETTY
LIVELY WITH MISS LINTON GENERALLY
'LIVELY NO HE HAS SHOWN THE GREATEST DISTRESS I ANSWERED
'TO SEE
HIM I SHOULD SAY THAT INSTEAD OF RAMBLING WITH HIS SWEETHEART ON THE
HILLS HE OUGHT TO BE IN BED UNDER THE HANDS OF A DOCTOR
'HE SHALL BE IN A DAY OR TWO MUTTERED HEATHCLIFF
'BUT FIRST GET UP
LINTON GET UP HE SHOUTED
'DON'T GROVEL ON THE GROUND THERE UP THIS
MOMENT
LINTON HAD SUNK PROSTRATE AGAIN IN ANOTHER PAROXYSM OF HELPLESS FEAR
CAUSED BY HIS FATHER'S GLANCE TOWARDS HIM I SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOTHING
ELSE TO PRODUCE SUCH HUMILIATION
HE MADE SEVERAL EFFORTS TO OBEY BUT
HIS LITTLE STRENGTH WAS ANNIHILATED FOR THE TIME AND HE FELL BACK AGAIN
WITH A MOAN
MR
HEATHCLIFF ADVANCED AND LIFTED HIM TO LEAN AGAINST A
RIDGE OF TURF
'NOW SAID HE WITH CURBED FEROCITY 'I'M GETTING ANGRY AND IF YOU DON'T
COMMAND THAT PALTRY SPIRIT OF YOURS DAMN YOU GET UP DIRECTLY
'I WILL FATHER HE PANTED
'ONLY LET ME ALONE OR I SHALL FAINT
I'VE
DONE AS YOU WISHED I'M SURE
CATHERINE WILL TELL YOU THAT I THAT
I HAVE BEEN CHEERFUL
AH KEEP BY ME CATHERINE GIVE ME YOUR HAND
'TAKE MINE SAID HIS FATHER 'STAND ON YOUR FEET
THERE NOW SHE'LL
LEND YOU HER ARM THAT'S RIGHT LOOK AT HER
YOU WOULD IMAGINE I WAS THE
DEVIL HIMSELF MISS LINTON TO EXCITE SUCH HORROR
BE SO KIND AS TO WALK
HOME WITH HIM WILL YOU HE SHUDDERS IF I TOUCH HIM
'LINTON DEAR WHISPERED CATHERINE 'I CAN'T GO TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS
PAPA HAS FORBIDDEN ME
HE'LL NOT HARM YOU WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID
'I CAN NEVER RE ENTER THAT HOUSE HE ANSWERED
'I'M NOT TO RE ENTER
IT WITHOUT YOU
'STOP CRIED HIS FATHER
'WE'LL RESPECT CATHERINE'S FILIAL SCRUPLES
NELLY TAKE HIM IN AND I'LL FOLLOW YOUR ADVICE CONCERNING THE DOCTOR
WITHOUT DELAY
'YOU'LL DO WELL REPLIED I
'BUT I MUST REMAIN WITH MY MISTRESS TO
MIND YOUR SON IS NOT MY BUSINESS
'YOU ARE VERY STIFF SAID HEATHCLIFF 'I KNOW THAT BUT YOU'LL FORCE ME
TO PINCH THE BABY AND MAKE IT SCREAM BEFORE IT MOVES YOUR CHARITY
COME
THEN MY HERO
ARE YOU WILLING TO RETURN ESCORTED BY ME
HE APPROACHED ONCE MORE AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD SEIZE THE FRAGILE BEING
BUT SHRINKING BACK LINTON CLUNG TO HIS COUSIN AND IMPLORED HER TO
ACCOMPANY HIM WITH A FRANTIC IMPORTUNITY THAT ADMITTED NO DENIAL
HOWEVER I DISAPPROVED I COULDN'T HINDER HER INDEED HOW COULD SHE HAVE
REFUSED HIM HERSELF WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH DREAD WE HAD NO MEANS OF
DISCERNING BUT THERE HE WAS POWERLESS UNDER ITS GRIPE AND ANY ADDITION
SEEMED CAPABLE OF SHOCKING HIM INTO IDIOTCY
WE REACHED THE THRESHOLD
CATHERINE WALKED IN AND I STOOD WAITING TILL SHE HAD CONDUCTED THE
INVALID TO A CHAIR EXPECTING HER OUT IMMEDIATELY WHEN MR
HEATHCLIFF
PUSHING ME FORWARD EXCLAIMED 'MY HOUSE IS NOT STRICKEN WITH THE PLAGUE
NELLY AND I HAVE A MIND TO BE HOSPITABLE TO DAY SIT DOWN AND ALLOW ME
TO SHUT THE DOOR
HE SHUT AND LOCKED IT ALSO
I STARTED
'YOU SHALL HAVE TEA BEFORE YOU GO HOME HE ADDED
'I AM BY MYSELF
HARETON IS GONE WITH SOME CATTLE TO THE LEES AND ZILLAH AND JOSEPH ARE
OFF ON A JOURNEY OF PLEASURE AND THOUGH I'M USED TO BEING ALONE I'D
RATHER HAVE SOME INTERESTING COMPANY IF I CAN GET IT
MISS LINTON TAKE
YOUR SEAT BY HIM
I GIVE YOU WHAT I HAVE THE PRESENT IS HARDLY WORTH
ACCEPTING BUT I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO OFFER
IT IS LINTON I MEAN
HOW
SHE DOES STARE IT'S ODD WHAT A SAVAGE FEELING I HAVE TO ANYTHING THAT
SEEMS AFRAID OF ME HAD I BEEN BORN WHERE LAWS ARE LESS STRICT AND
TASTES LESS DAINTY I SHOULD TREAT MYSELF TO A SLOW VIVISECTION OF THOSE
TWO AS AN EVENING'S AMUSEMENT
HE DREW IN HIS BREATH STRUCK THE TABLE AND SWORE TO HIMSELF 'BY HELL
I HATE THEM
'I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU EXCLAIMED CATHERINE WHO COULD NOT HEAR THE
LATTER PART OF HIS SPEECH
SHE STEPPED CLOSE UP HER BLACK EYES FLASHING
WITH PASSION AND RESOLUTION
'GIVE ME THAT KEY I WILL HAVE IT SHE
SAID
'I WOULDN'T EAT OR DRINK HERE IF I WERE STARVING
HEATHCLIFF HAD THE KEY IN HIS HAND THAT REMAINED ON THE TABLE
HE LOOKED
UP SEIZED WITH A SORT OF SURPRISE AT HER BOLDNESS OR POSSIBLY
REMINDED BY HER VOICE AND GLANCE OF THE PERSON FROM WHOM SHE INHERITED
IT
SHE SNATCHED AT THE INSTRUMENT AND HALF SUCCEEDED IN GETTING IT OUT
OF HIS LOOSENED FINGERS BUT HER ACTION RECALLED HIM TO THE PRESENT HE
RECOVERED IT SPEEDILY
'NOW CATHERINE LINTON HE SAID 'STAND OFF OR I SHALL KNOCK YOU DOWN
AND THAT WILL MAKE MRS
DEAN MAD
REGARDLESS OF THIS WARNING SHE CAPTURED HIS CLOSED HAND AND ITS CONTENTS
AGAIN
'WE WILL GO SHE REPEATED EXERTING HER UTMOST EFFORTS TO CAUSE
THE IRON MUSCLES TO RELAX AND FINDING THAT HER NAILS MADE NO IMPRESSION
SHE APPLIED HER TEETH PRETTY SHARPLY
HEATHCLIFF GLANCED AT ME A GLANCE
THAT KEPT ME FROM INTERFERING A MOMENT
CATHERINE WAS TOO INTENT ON HIS
FINGERS TO NOTICE HIS FACE
HE OPENED THEM SUDDENLY AND RESIGNED THE
OBJECT OF DISPUTE BUT ERE SHE HAD WELL SECURED IT HE SEIZED HER WITH
THE LIBERATED HAND AND PULLING HER ON HIS KNEE ADMINISTERED WITH THE
OTHER A SHOWER OF TERRIFIC SLAPS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HEAD EACH
SUFFICIENT TO HAVE FULFILLED HIS THREAT HAD SHE BEEN ABLE TO FALL
AT THIS DIABOLICAL VIOLENCE I RUSHED ON HIM FURIOUSLY
'YOU VILLAIN I
BEGAN TO CRY 'YOU VILLAIN A TOUCH ON THE CHEST SILENCED ME I AM
STOUT AND SOON PUT OUT OF BREATH AND WHAT WITH THAT AND THE RAGE I
STAGGERED DIZZILY BACK AND FELT READY TO SUFFOCATE OR TO BURST A
BLOOD VESSEL
THE SCENE WAS OVER IN TWO MINUTES CATHERINE RELEASED
PUT HER TWO HANDS TO HER TEMPLES AND LOOKED JUST AS IF SHE WERE NOT
SURE WHETHER HER EARS WERE OFF OR ON
SHE TREMBLED LIKE A REED POOR
THING AND LEANT AGAINST THE TABLE PERFECTLY BEWILDERED
'I KNOW HOW TO CHASTISE CHILDREN YOU SEE SAID THE SCOUNDREL GRIMLY
AS HE STOOPED TO REPOSSESS HIMSELF OF THE KEY WHICH HAD DROPPED TO THE
FLOOR
'GO TO LINTON NOW AS I TOLD YOU AND CRY AT YOUR EASE I SHALL
BE YOUR FATHER TO MORROW ALL THE FATHER YOU'LL HAVE IN A FEW DAYS AND
YOU SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF THAT
YOU CAN BEAR PLENTY YOU'RE NO WEAKLING
YOU SHALL HAVE A DAILY TASTE IF I CATCH SUCH A DEVIL OF A TEMPER IN YOUR
EYES AGAIN
CATHY RAN TO ME INSTEAD OF LINTON AND KNELT DOWN AND PUT HER BURNING
CHEEK ON MY LAP WEEPING ALOUD
HER COUSIN HAD SHRUNK INTO A CORNER OF
THE SETTLE AS QUIET AS A MOUSE CONGRATULATING HIMSELF I DARE SAY THAT
THE CORRECTION HAD ALIGHTED ON ANOTHER THAN HIM
MR
HEATHCLIFF
PERCEIVING US ALL CONFOUNDED ROSE AND EXPEDITIOUSLY MADE THE TEA
HIMSELF
THE CUPS AND SAUCERS WERE LAID READY
HE POURED IT OUT AND
HANDED ME A CUP
'WASH AWAY YOUR SPLEEN HE SAID
'AND HELP YOUR OWN NAUGHTY PET AND
MINE
IT IS NOT POISONED THOUGH I PREPARED IT
I'M GOING OUT TO SEEK
YOUR HORSES
OUR FIRST THOUGHT ON HIS DEPARTURE WAS TO FORCE AN EXIT SOMEWHERE
WE
TRIED THE KITCHEN DOOR BUT THAT WAS FASTENED OUTSIDE WE LOOKED AT THE
WINDOWS THEY WERE TOO NARROW FOR EVEN CATHY'S LITTLE FIGURE
'MASTER LINTON I CRIED SEEING WE WERE REGULARLY IMPRISONED 'YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR DIABOLICAL FATHER IS AFTER AND YOU SHALL TELL US OR I'LL BOX
YOUR EARS AS HE HAS DONE YOUR COUSIN'S
'YES LINTON YOU MUST TELL SAID CATHERINE
'IT WAS FOR YOUR SAKE I
CAME AND IT WILL BE WICKEDLY UNGRATEFUL IF YOU REFUSE
'GIVE ME SOME TEA I'M THIRSTY AND THEN I'LL TELL YOU HE ANSWERED
'MRS
DEAN GO AWAY
I DON'T LIKE YOU STANDING OVER ME
NOW CATHERINE
YOU ARE LETTING YOUR TEARS FALL INTO MY CUP
I WON'T DRINK THAT
GIVE
ME ANOTHER CATHERINE PUSHED ANOTHER TO HIM AND WIPED HER FACE
I
FELT DISGUSTED AT THE LITTLE WRETCH'S COMPOSURE SINCE HE WAS NO LONGER
IN TERROR FOR HIMSELF
THE ANGUISH HE HAD EXHIBITED ON THE MOOR SUBSIDED
AS SOON AS EVER HE ENTERED WUTHERING HEIGHTS SO I GUESSED HE HAD BEEN
MENACED WITH AN AWFUL VISITATION OF WRATH IF HE FAILED IN DECOYING US
THERE AND THAT ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD NO FURTHER IMMEDIATE FEARS
'PAPA WANTS US TO BE MARRIED HE CONTINUED AFTER SIPPING SOME OF THE
LIQUID
'AND HE KNOWS YOUR PAPA WOULDN'T LET US MARRY NOW AND HE'S
AFRAID OF MY DYING IF WE WAIT SO WE ARE TO BE MARRIED IN THE MORNING
AND YOU ARE TO STAY HERE ALL NIGHT AND IF YOU DO AS HE WISHES YOU
SHALL RETURN HOME NEXT DAY AND TAKE ME WITH YOU
'TAKE YOU WITH HER PITIFUL CHANGELING I EXCLAIMED
YOU MARRY WHY
THE MAN IS MAD OR HE THINKS US FOOLS EVERY ONE
AND DO YOU IMAGINE
THAT BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADY THAT HEALTHY HEARTY GIRL WILL TIE HERSELF TO
A LITTLE PERISHING MONKEY LIKE YOU ARE YOU CHERISHING THE NOTION THAT
ANYBODY LET ALONE MISS CATHERINE LINTON WOULD HAVE YOU FOR A HUSBAND
YOU WANT WHIPPING FOR BRINGING US IN HERE AT ALL WITH YOUR DASTARDLY
PULING TRICKS AND DON'T LOOK SO SILLY NOW I'VE A VERY GOOD MIND TO
SHAKE YOU SEVERELY FOR YOUR CONTEMPTIBLE TREACHERY AND YOUR IMBECILE
CONCEIT
I DID GIVE HIM A SLIGHT SHAKING BUT IT BROUGHT ON THE COUGH AND HE TOOK
TO HIS ORDINARY RESOURCE OF MOANING AND WEEPING AND CATHERINE REBUKED
ME
'STAY ALL NIGHT NO SHE SAID LOOKING SLOWLY ROUND
'ELLEN I'LL BURN
THAT DOOR DOWN BUT I'LL GET OUT
AND SHE WOULD HAVE COMMENCED THE EXECUTION OF HER THREAT DIRECTLY BUT
LINTON WAS UP IN ALARM FOR HIS DEAR SELF AGAIN
HE CLASPED HER IN HIS
TWO FEEBLE ARMS SOBBING 'WON'T YOU HAVE ME AND SAVE ME NOT LET ME
COME TO THE GRANGE OH DARLING CATHERINE YOU MUSTN'T GO AND LEAVE
AFTER ALL
YOU MUST OBEY MY FATHER YOU MUST
'I MUST OBEY MY OWN SHE REPLIED 'AND RELIEVE HIM FROM THIS CRUEL
SUSPENSE
THE WHOLE NIGHT WHAT WOULD HE THINK HE'LL BE DISTRESSED
ALREADY
I'LL EITHER BREAK OR BURN A WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE
BE QUIET
YOU'RE IN NO DANGER BUT IF YOU HINDER ME LINTON I LOVE PAPA BETTER
THAN YOU THE MORTAL TERROR HE FELT OF MR
HEATHCLIFF'S ANGER RESTORED
TO THE BOY HIS COWARD'S ELOQUENCE
CATHERINE WAS NEAR DISTRAUGHT STILL
SHE PERSISTED THAT SHE MUST GO HOME AND TRIED ENTREATY IN HER TURN
PERSUADING HIM TO SUBDUE HIS SELFISH AGONY
WHILE THEY WERE THUS
OCCUPIED OUR JAILOR RE ENTERED
'YOUR BEASTS HAVE TROTTED OFF HE SAID 'AND NOW LINTON SNIVELLING
AGAIN WHAT HAS SHE BEEN DOING TO YOU COME COME HAVE DONE AND GET
TO BED
IN A MONTH OR TWO MY LAD YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PAY HER BACK HER

HE SPOKE THESE WORDS HOLDING THE DOOR OPEN FOR HIS SON TO PASS AND THE
LATTER ACHIEVED HIS EXIT EXACTLY AS A SPANIEL MIGHT WHICH SUSPECTED THE
PERSON WHO ATTENDED ON IT OF DESIGNING A SPITEFUL SQUEEZE
THE LOCK WAS
RE SECURED
HEATHCLIFF APPROACHED THE FIRE WHERE MY MISTRESS AND I
STOOD SILENT
CATHERINE LOOKED UP AND INSTINCTIVELY RAISED HER HAND TO
HER CHEEK HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD REVIVED A PAINFUL SENSATION
ANYBODY ELSE
WOULD HAVE BEEN INCAPABLE OF REGARDING THE CHILDISH ACT WITH STERNNESS
BUT HE SCOWLED ON HER AND MUTTERED 'OH YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF ME YOUR
COURAGE IS WELL DISGUISED YOU SEEM DAMNABLY AFRAID
'I AM AFRAID NOW SHE REPLIED 'BECAUSE IF I STAY PAPA WILL BE
MISERABLE AND HOW CAN I ENDURE MAKING HIM MISERABLE WHEN HE WHEN
HE MR
HEATHCLIFF LET ME GO HOME I PROMISE TO MARRY LINTON PAPA
WOULD LIKE ME TO AND I LOVE HIM
WHY SHOULD YOU WISH TO FORCE ME TO DO
WHAT I'LL WILLINGLY DO OF MYSELF
'LET HIM DARE TO FORCE YOU I CRIED
'THERE'S LAW IN THE LAND THANK
GOD THERE IS THOUGH WE BE IN AN OUT OF THE WAY PLACE
I'D INFORM IF HE
WERE MY OWN SON AND IT'S FELONY WITHOUT BENEFIT OF CLERGY

'TO THE DEVIL WITH YOUR CLAMOUR I DON'T
WANT YOU TO SPEAK
MISS LINTON I SHALL ENJOY MYSELF REMARKABLY IN
THINKING YOUR FATHER WILL BE MISERABLE I SHALL NOT SLEEP FOR
SATISFACTION
YOU COULD HAVE HIT ON NO SURER WAY OF FIXING YOUR
RESIDENCE UNDER MY ROOF FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAN INFORMING ME
THAT SUCH AN EVENT WOULD FOLLOW
AS TO YOUR PROMISE TO MARRY LINTON
I'LL TAKE CARE YOU SHALL KEEP IT FOR YOU SHALL NOT QUIT THIS PLACE TILL
IT IS FULFILLED
'SEND ELLEN THEN TO LET PAPA KNOW I'M SAFE EXCLAIMED CATHERINE

'OR MARRY ME NOW
POOR PAPA ELLEN HE'LL THINK
WE'RE LOST
WHAT SHALL WE DO
'NOT HE HE'LL THINK YOU ARE TIRED OF WAITING ON HIM AND RUN OFF FOR A
LITTLE AMUSEMENT ANSWERED HEATHCLIFF
'YOU CANNOT DENY THAT YOU
ENTERED MY HOUSE OF YOUR OWN ACCORD IN CONTEMPT OF HIS INJUNCTIONS TO
THE CONTRARY
AND IT IS QUITE NATURAL THAT YOU SHOULD DESIRE AMUSEMENT
AT YOUR AGE AND THAT YOU WOULD WEARY OF NURSING A SICK MAN AND THAT MAN
ONLY YOUR FATHER
CATHERINE HIS HAPPIEST DAYS WERE OVER WHEN YOUR
DAYS BEGAN
HE CURSED YOU I DARE SAY FOR COMING INTO THE WORLD I DID
AT LEAST AND IT WOULD JUST DO IF HE CURSED YOU AS HE WENT OUT OF IT
I'D JOIN HIM
I DON'T LOVE YOU HOW SHOULD I WEEP AWAY
AS FAR AS I
CAN SEE IT WILL BE YOUR CHIEF DIVERSION HEREAFTER UNLESS LINTON MAKE
AMENDS FOR OTHER LOSSES AND YOUR PROVIDENT PARENT APPEARS TO FANCY HE
MAY
HIS LETTERS OF ADVICE AND CONSOLATION ENTERTAINED ME VASTLY
IN
HIS LAST HE RECOMMENDED MY JEWEL TO BE CAREFUL OF HIS AND KIND TO HER
WHEN HE GOT HER
CAREFUL AND KIND THAT'S PATERNAL
BUT LINTON REQUIRES
HIS WHOLE STOCK OF CARE AND KINDNESS FOR HIMSELF
LINTON CAN PLAY THE
LITTLE TYRANT WELL
HE'LL UNDERTAKE TO TORTURE ANY NUMBER OF CATS IF
THEIR TEETH BE DRAWN AND THEIR CLAWS PARED
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL HIS
UNCLE FINE TALES OF HIS KINDNESS WHEN YOU GET HOME AGAIN I ASSURE
YOU
'YOU'RE RIGHT THERE I SAID 'EXPLAIN YOUR SON'S CHARACTER
SHOW HIS
RESEMBLANCE TO YOURSELF AND THEN I HOPE MISS CATHY WILL THINK TWICE
BEFORE SHE TAKES THE COCKATRICE
'I DON'T MUCH MIND SPEAKING OF HIS AMIABLE QUALITIES NOW HE ANSWERED
'BECAUSE SHE MUST EITHER ACCEPT HIM OR REMAIN A PRISONER AND YOU ALONG
WITH HER TILL YOUR MASTER DIES
I CAN DETAIN YOU BOTH QUITE CONCEALED
HERE
IF YOU DOUBT ENCOURAGE HER TO RETRACT HER WORD AND YOU'LL HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY OF JUDGING
'I'LL NOT RETRACT MY WORD SAID CATHERINE
'I'LL MARRY HIM WITHIN THIS
HOUR IF I MAY GO TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE AFTERWARDS
MR
HEATHCLIFF
YOU'RE A CRUEL MAN BUT YOU'RE NOT A FIEND AND YOU WON'T FROM MERE
MALICE DESTROY IRREVOCABLY ALL MY HAPPINESS
IF PAPA THOUGHT I HAD LEFT
HIM ON PURPOSE AND IF HE DIED BEFORE I RETURNED COULD I BEAR TO LIVE
I'VE GIVEN OVER CRYING BUT I'M GOING TO KNEEL HERE AT YOUR KNEE AND
I'LL NOT GET UP AND I'LL NOT TAKE MY EYES FROM YOUR FACE TILL YOU LOOK
BACK AT ME NO DON'T TURN AWAY DO LOOK YOU'LL SEE NOTHING TO
PROVOKE YOU
I DON'T HATE YOU
I'M NOT ANGRY THAT YOU STRUCK ME

YOU NEVER LOVED ANYBODY IN ALL YOUR LIFE UNCLE NEVER AH YOU MUST
LOOK ONCE
I'M SO WRETCHED YOU CAN'T HELP BEING SORRY AND PITYING ME
'KEEP YOUR EFT'S FINGERS OFF AND MOVE OR I'LL KICK YOU CRIED
HEATHCLIFF BRUTALLY REPULSING HER
'I'D RATHER BE HUGGED BY A SNAKE
HOW THE DEVIL CAN YOU DREAM OF FAWNING ON ME I DETEST YOU
HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS SHOOK HIMSELF INDEED AS IF HIS FLESH CREPT
WITH AVERSION AND THRUST BACK HIS CHAIR WHILE I GOT UP AND OPENED MY
MOUTH TO COMMENCE A DOWNRIGHT TORRENT OF ABUSE
BUT I WAS RENDERED DUMB
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST SENTENCE BY A THREAT THAT I SHOULD BE SHOWN
INTO A ROOM BY MYSELF THE VERY NEXT SYLLABLE I UTTERED
IT WAS GROWING
DARK WE HEARD A SOUND OF VOICES AT THE GARDEN GATE
OUR HOST HURRIED
OUT INSTANTLY HE HAD HIS WITS ABOUT HIM WE HAD NOT
THERE WAS A
TALK OF TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND HE RETURNED ALONE
'I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN YOUR COUSIN HARETON I OBSERVED TO CATHERINE
'I
WISH HE WOULD ARRIVE WHO KNOWS BUT HE MIGHT TAKE OUR PART
'IT WAS THREE SERVANTS SENT TO SEEK YOU FROM THE GRANGE SAID
HEATHCLIFF OVERHEARING ME
'YOU SHOULD HAVE OPENED A LATTICE AND CALLED
OUT BUT I COULD SWEAR THAT CHIT IS GLAD YOU DIDN'T
SHE'S GLAD TO BE
OBLIGED TO STAY I'M CERTAIN
AT LEARNING THE CHANCE WE HAD MISSED WE BOTH GAVE VENT TO OUR GRIEF
WITHOUT CONTROL AND HE ALLOWED US TO WAIL ON TILL NINE O'CLOCK
THEN HE
BID US GO UPSTAIRS THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO ZILLAH'S CHAMBER AND I
WHISPERED MY COMPANION TO OBEY PERHAPS WE MIGHT CONTRIVE TO GET THROUGH
THE WINDOW THERE OR INTO A GARRET AND OUT BY ITS SKYLIGHT
THE WINDOW
HOWEVER WAS NARROW LIKE THOSE BELOW AND THE GARRET TRAP WAS SAFE FROM
OUR ATTEMPTS FOR WE WERE FASTENED IN AS BEFORE
WE NEITHER OF US LAY
DOWN CATHERINE TOOK HER STATION BY THE LATTICE AND WATCHED ANXIOUSLY
FOR MORNING A DEEP SIGH BEING THE ONLY ANSWER I COULD OBTAIN TO MY
FREQUENT ENTREATIES THAT SHE WOULD TRY TO REST
I SEATED MYSELF IN A
CHAIR AND ROCKED TO AND FRO PASSING HARSH JUDGMENT ON MY MANY
DERELICTIONS OF DUTY FROM WHICH IT STRUCK ME THEN ALL THE MISFORTUNES
OF MY EMPLOYERS SPRANG
IT WAS NOT THE CASE IN REALITY I AM AWARE BUT
IT WAS IN MY IMAGINATION THAT DISMAL NIGHT AND I THOUGHT HEATHCLIFF
HIMSELF LESS GUILTY THAN I
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK HE CAME AND INQUIRED IF MISS LINTON HAD RISEN
SHE RAN
TO THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY AND ANSWERED 'YES 'HERE THEN HE SAID
OPENING IT AND PULLING HER OUT
I ROSE TO FOLLOW BUT HE TURNED THE
LOCK AGAIN
I DEMANDED MY RELEASE
'BE PATIENT HE REPLIED 'I'LL SEND UP YOUR BREAKFAST IN A WHILE
I THUMPED ON THE PANELS AND RATTLED THE LATCH ANGRILY AND CATHERINE
ASKED WHY I WAS STILL SHUT UP HE ANSWERED I MUST TRY TO ENDURE IT
ANOTHER HOUR AND THEY WENT AWAY
I ENDURED IT TWO OR THREE HOURS AT
LENGTH I HEARD A FOOTSTEP NOT HEATHCLIFF'S
'I'VE BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING TO EAT SAID A VOICE 'OPPEN T' DOOR
COMPLYING EAGERLY I BEHELD HARETON LADEN WITH FOOD ENOUGH TO LAST ME
ALL DAY
'TAK' IT HE ADDED THRUSTING THE TRAY INTO MY HAND
'STAY ONE MINUTE I BEGAN
'NAY CRIED HE AND RETIRED REGARDLESS OF ANY PRAYERS I COULD POUR
FORTH TO DETAIN HIM
AND THERE I REMAINED ENCLOSED THE WHOLE DAY AND THE WHOLE OF THE NEXT
NIGHT AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
FIVE NIGHTS AND FOUR DAYS I REMAINED
ALTOGETHER SEEING NOBODY BUT HARETON ONCE EVERY MORNING AND HE WAS A
MODEL OF A JAILOR SURLY AND DUMB AND DEAF TO EVERY ATTEMPT AT MOVING
HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE OR COMPASSION
CHAPTER XXVIII
ON THE FIFTH MORNING OR RATHER AFTERNOON A DIFFERENT STEP
APPROACHED LIGHTER AND SHORTER AND THIS TIME THE PERSON ENTERED THE
ROOM
IT WAS ZILLAH DONNED IN HER SCARLET SHAWL WITH A BLACK SILK
BONNET ON HER HEAD AND A WILLOW BASKET SWUNG TO HER ARM
'EH DEAR MRS
DEAN SHE EXCLAIMED
'WELL THERE IS A TALK ABOUT YOU
AT GIMMERTON
I NEVER THOUGHT BUT YOU WERE SUNK IN THE BLACKHORSE MARSH
AND MISSY WITH YOU TILL MASTER TOLD ME YOU'D BEEN FOUND AND HE'D LODGED
YOU HERE WHAT AND YOU MUST HAVE GOT ON AN ISLAND SURE AND HOW LONG
WERE YOU IN THE HOLE DID MASTER SAVE YOU MRS
DEAN BUT YOU'RE NOT SO
THIN YOU'VE NOT BEEN SO POORLY HAVE YOU
'YOUR MASTER IS A TRUE SCOUNDREL I REPLIED
'BUT HE SHALL ANSWER FOR
IT
HE NEEDN'T HAVE RAISED THAT TALE IT SHALL ALL BE LAID BARE
'WHAT DO YOU MEAN ASKED ZILLAH
'IT'S NOT HIS TALE THEY TELL THAT IN
THE VILLAGE ABOUT YOUR BEING LOST IN THE MARSH AND I CALLS TO EARNSHAW
WHEN I COME IN EH THEY'S QUEER THINGS MR
HARETON HAPPENED SINCE I
WENT OFF
IT'S A SAD PITY OF THAT LIKELY YOUNG LASS AND CANT NELLY
DEAN HE STARED
I THOUGHT HE HAD NOT HEARD AUGHT SO I TOLD HIM THE
RUMOUR
THE MASTER LISTENED AND HE JUST SMILED TO HIMSELF AND SAID
IF THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE MARSH THEY ARE OUT NOW ZILLAH
NELLY DEAN IS
LODGED AT THIS MINUTE IN YOUR ROOM
YOU CAN TELL HER TO FLIT WHEN YOU
GO UP HERE IS THE KEY
THE BOG WATER GOT INTO HER HEAD AND SHE WOULD
HAVE RUN HOME QUITE FLIGHTY BUT I FIXED HER TILL SHE CAME ROUND TO HER
SENSES
YOU CAN BID HER GO TO THE GRANGE AT ONCE IF SHE BE ABLE AND
CARRY A MESSAGE FROM ME THAT HER YOUNG LADY WILL FOLLOW IN TIME TO
ATTEND THE SQUIRE'S FUNERAL
'MR
EDGAR IS NOT DEAD I GASPED
'OH ZILLAH ZILLAH
'NO NO SIT YOU DOWN MY GOOD MISTRESS SHE REPLIED 'YOU'RE RIGHT
SICKLY YET
HE'S NOT DEAD DOCTOR KENNETH THINKS HE MAY LAST ANOTHER
DAY
I MET HIM ON THE ROAD AND ASKED
INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN I SNATCHED MY OUTDOOR THINGS AND HASTENED
BELOW FOR THE WAY WAS FREE
ON ENTERING THE HOUSE I LOOKED ABOUT FOR
SOME ONE TO GIVE INFORMATION OF CATHERINE
THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH
SUNSHINE AND THE DOOR STOOD WIDE OPEN BUT NOBODY SEEMED AT HAND
AS I
HESITATED WHETHER TO GO OFF AT ONCE OR RETURN AND SEEK MY MISTRESS A
SLIGHT COUGH DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE HEARTH
LINTON LAY ON THE SETTLE
SOLE TENANT SUCKING A STICK OF SUGAR CANDY AND PURSUING MY MOVEMENTS
WITH APATHETIC EYES
'WHERE IS MISS CATHERINE I DEMANDED STERNLY
SUPPOSING I COULD FRIGHTEN HIM INTO GIVING INTELLIGENCE BY CATCHING HIM
THUS ALONE
HE SUCKED ON LIKE AN INNOCENT
'IS SHE GONE I SAID
'NO HE REPLIED 'SHE'S UPSTAIRS SHE'S NOT TO GO WE WON'T LET HER
'YOU WON'T LET HER LITTLE IDIOT I EXCLAIMED
'DIRECT ME TO HER ROOM
IMMEDIATELY OR I'LL MAKE YOU SING OUT SHARPLY
'PAPA WOULD MAKE YOU SING OUT IF YOU ATTEMPTED TO GET THERE HE
ANSWERED
'HE SAYS I'M NOT TO BE SOFT WITH CATHERINE SHE'S MY WIFE AND
IT'S SHAMEFUL THAT SHE SHOULD WISH TO LEAVE ME
HE SAYS SHE HATES ME AND
WANTS ME TO DIE THAT SHE MAY HAVE MY MONEY BUT SHE SHAN'T HAVE IT AND
SHE SHAN'T GO HOME SHE NEVER SHALL SHE MAY CRY AND BE SICK AS MUCH
AS SHE PLEASES
HE RESUMED HIS FORMER OCCUPATION CLOSING HIS LIDS AS IF HE MEANT TO
DROP ASLEEP
'MASTER HEATHCLIFF I RESUMED 'HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ALL CATHERINE'S
KINDNESS TO YOU LAST WINTER WHEN YOU AFFIRMED YOU LOVED HER AND WHEN
SHE BROUGHT YOU BOOKS AND SUNG YOU SONGS AND CAME MANY A TIME THROUGH
WIND AND SNOW TO SEE YOU SHE WEPT TO MISS ONE EVENING BECAUSE YOU
WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU FELT THEN THAT SHE WAS A HUNDRED TIMES TOO
GOOD TO YOU AND NOW YOU BELIEVE THE LIES YOUR FATHER TELLS THOUGH YOU
KNOW HE DETESTS YOU BOTH
AND YOU JOIN HIM AGAINST HER
THAT'S FINE
GRATITUDE IS IT NOT
THE CORNER OF LINTON'S MOUTH FELL AND HE TOOK THE SUGAR CANDY FROM HIS
LIPS
'DID SHE COME TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS BECAUSE SHE HATED YOU I CONTINUED
'THINK FOR YOURSELF AS TO YOUR MONEY SHE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW THAT YOU
WILL HAVE ANY
AND YOU SAY SHE'S SICK AND YET YOU LEAVE HER ALONE UP
THERE IN A STRANGE HOUSE YOU WHO HAVE FELT WHAT IT IS TO BE SO
NEGLECTED YOU COULD PITY YOUR OWN SUFFERINGS AND SHE PITIED THEM TOO
BUT YOU WON'T PITY HERS I SHED TEARS MASTER HEATHCLIFF YOU SEE AN
ELDERLY WOMAN AND A SERVANT MERELY AND YOU AFTER PRETENDING SUCH
AFFECTION AND HAVING REASON TO WORSHIP HER ALMOST STORE EVERY TEAR YOU
HAVE FOR YOURSELF AND LIE THERE QUITE AT EASE
AH YOU'RE A HEARTLESS
SELFISH BOY
'I CAN'T STAY WITH HER HE ANSWERED CROSSLY
'I'LL NOT STAY BY MYSELF
SHE CRIES SO I CAN'T BEAR IT
AND SHE WON'T GIVE OVER THOUGH I SAY I'LL
CALL MY FATHER
I DID CALL HIM ONCE AND HE THREATENED TO STRANGLE HER
IF SHE WAS NOT QUIET BUT SHE BEGAN AGAIN THE INSTANT HE LEFT THE ROOM
MOANING AND GRIEVING ALL NIGHT LONG THOUGH I SCREAMED FOR VEXATION THAT
I COULDN'T SLEEP
'IS MR
HEATHCLIFF OUT I INQUIRED PERCEIVING THAT THE WRETCHED
CREATURE HAD NO POWER TO SYMPATHIZE WITH HIS COUSIN'S MENTAL TORTURES
'HE'S IN THE COURT HE REPLIED 'TALKING TO DOCTOR KENNETH WHO SAYS
UNCLE IS DYING TRULY AT LAST
I'M GLAD FOR I SHALL BE MASTER OF THE
GRANGE AFTER HIM
CATHERINE ALWAYS SPOKE OF IT AS HER HOUSE
IT ISN'T
HERS IT'S MINE PAPA SAYS EVERYTHING SHE HAS IS MINE
ALL HER NICE
BOOKS ARE MINE SHE OFFERED TO GIVE ME THEM AND HER PRETTY BIRDS AND
HER PONY MINNY IF I WOULD GET THE KEY OF OUR ROOM AND LET HER OUT BUT
I TOLD HER SHE HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEY WERE ALL ALL MINE
AND THEN
SHE CRIED AND TOOK A LITTLE PICTURE FROM HER NECK AND SAID I SHOULD
HAVE THAT TWO PICTURES IN A GOLD CASE ON ONE SIDE HER MOTHER AND ON
THE OTHER UNCLE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG
THAT WAS YESTERDAY I SAID THEY
WERE MINE TOO AND TRIED TO GET THEM FROM HER
THE SPITEFUL THING
WOULDN'T LET ME SHE PUSHED ME OFF AND HURT ME
I SHRIEKED OUT THAT
FRIGHTENS HER SHE HEARD PAPA COMING AND SHE BROKE THE HINGES AND
DIVIDED THE CASE AND GAVE ME HER MOTHER'S PORTRAIT THE OTHER SHE
ATTEMPTED TO HIDE BUT PAPA ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND I EXPLAINED
IT
HE TOOK THE ONE I HAD AWAY AND ORDERED HER TO RESIGN HERS TO ME
SHE REFUSED AND HE HE STRUCK HER DOWN AND WRENCHED IT OFF THE CHAIN
AND CRUSHED IT WITH HIS FOOT
'AND WERE YOU PLEASED TO SEE HER STRUCK I ASKED HAVING MY DESIGNS IN
ENCOURAGING HIS TALK
'I WINKED HE ANSWERED 'I WINK TO SEE MY FATHER STRIKE A DOG OR A
HORSE HE DOES IT SO HARD
YET I WAS GLAD AT FIRST SHE DESERVED
PUNISHING FOR PUSHING ME BUT WHEN PAPA WAS GONE SHE MADE ME COME TO THE
WINDOW AND SHOWED ME HER CHEEK CUT ON THE INSIDE AGAINST HER TEETH AND
HER MOUTH FILLING WITH BLOOD AND THEN SHE GATHERED UP THE BITS OF THE
PICTURE AND WENT AND SAT DOWN WITH HER FACE TO THE WALL AND SHE HAS
NEVER SPOKEN TO ME SINCE AND I SOMETIMES THINK SHE CAN'T SPEAK FOR PAIN
I DON'T LIKE TO THINK SO BUT SHE'S A NAUGHTY THING FOR CRYING
CONTINUALLY AND SHE LOOKS SO PALE AND WILD I'M AFRAID OF HER
'AND YOU CAN GET THE KEY IF YOU CHOOSE I SAID
'YES WHEN I AM UP STAIRS HE ANSWERED 'BUT I CAN'T WALK UP STAIRS
NOW
'IN WHAT APARTMENT IS IT I ASKED
'OH HE CRIED 'I SHAN'T TELL YOU WHERE IT IS
IT IS OUR SECRET
NOBODY NEITHER HARETON NOR ZILLAH IS TO KNOW
THERE YOU'VE TIRED
ME GO AWAY GO AWAY AND HE TURNED HIS FACE ON TO HIS ARM AND SHUT
HIS EYES AGAIN
I CONSIDERED IT BEST TO DEPART WITHOUT SEEING MR
HEATHCLIFF AND BRING A
RESCUE FOR MY YOUNG LADY FROM THE GRANGE
ON REACHING IT THE
ASTONISHMENT OF MY FELLOW SERVANTS TO SEE ME AND THEIR JOY ALSO WAS
INTENSE AND WHEN THEY HEARD THAT THEIR LITTLE MISTRESS WAS SAFE TWO OR
THREE WERE ABOUT TO HURRY UP AND SHOUT THE NEWS AT MR
EDGAR'S DOOR BUT
I BESPOKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF IT MYSELF
HOW CHANGED I FOUND HIM EVEN
IN THOSE FEW DAYS HE LAY AN IMAGE OF SADNESS AND RESIGNATION AWAITING
HIS DEATH
VERY YOUNG HE LOOKED THOUGH HIS ACTUAL AGE WAS THIRTY NINE
ONE WOULD HAVE CALLED HIM TEN YEARS YOUNGER AT LEAST
HE THOUGHT OF
CATHERINE FOR HE MURMURED HER NAME
I TOUCHED HIS HAND AND SPOKE
'CATHERINE IS COMING DEAR MASTER I WHISPERED 'SHE IS ALIVE AND WELL
AND WILL BE HERE I HOPE TO NIGHT
I TREMBLED AT THE FIRST EFFECTS OF THIS INTELLIGENCE HE HALF ROSE UP
LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE APARTMENT AND THEN SANK BACK IN A SWOON
AS
SOON AS HE RECOVERED I RELATED OUR COMPULSORY VISIT AND DETENTION AT
THE HEIGHTS
I SAID HEATHCLIFF FORCED ME TO GO IN WHICH WAS NOT QUITE
TRUE
I UTTERED AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE AGAINST LINTON NOR DID I DESCRIBE
ALL HIS FATHER'S BRUTAL CONDUCT MY INTENTIONS BEING TO ADD NO
BITTERNESS IF I COULD HELP IT TO HIS ALREADY OVER FLOWING CUP
HE DIVINED THAT ONE OF HIS ENEMY'S PURPOSES WAS TO SECURE THE PERSONAL
PROPERTY AS WELL AS THE ESTATE TO HIS SON OR RATHER HIMSELF YET WHY
HE DID NOT WAIT TILL HIS DECEASE WAS A PUZZLE TO MY MASTER BECAUSE
IGNORANT HOW NEARLY HE AND HIS NEPHEW WOULD QUIT THE WORLD TOGETHER
HOWEVER HE FELT THAT HIS WILL HAD BETTER BE ALTERED INSTEAD OF LEAVING
CATHERINE'S FORTUNE AT HER OWN DISPOSAL HE DETERMINED TO PUT IT IN THE
HANDS OF TRUSTEES FOR HER USE DURING LIFE AND FOR HER CHILDREN IF SHE
HAD ANY AFTER HER
BY THAT MEANS IT COULD NOT FALL TO MR
HEATHCLIFF
SHOULD LINTON DIE
HAVING RECEIVED HIS ORDERS I DESPATCHED A MAN TO FETCH THE ATTORNEY AND
FOUR MORE PROVIDED WITH SERVICEABLE WEAPONS TO DEMAND MY YOUNG LADY OF
HER JAILOR
BOTH PARTIES WERE DELAYED VERY LATE
THE SINGLE SERVANT
RETURNED FIRST
HE SAID MR
GREEN THE LAWYER WAS OUT WHEN HE ARRIVED
AT HIS HOUSE AND HE HAD TO WAIT TWO HOURS FOR HIS RE ENTRANCE AND THEN
MR
GREEN TOLD HIM HE HAD A LITTLE BUSINESS IN THE VILLAGE THAT MUST BE
DONE BUT HE WOULD BE AT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE BEFORE MORNING
THE FOUR MEN
CAME BACK UNACCOMPANIED ALSO
THEY BROUGHT WORD THAT CATHERINE WAS ILL
TOO ILL TO QUIT HER ROOM AND HEATHCLIFF WOULD NOT SUFFER THEM TO SEE
HER
I SCOLDED THE STUPID FELLOWS WELL FOR LISTENING TO THAT TALE WHICH
I WOULD NOT CARRY TO MY MASTER RESOLVING TO TAKE A WHOLE BEVY UP TO THE
HEIGHTS AT DAY LIGHT AND STORM IT LITERALLY UNLESS THE PRISONER WERE
QUIETLY SURRENDERED TO US
HER FATHER SHALL SEE HER I VOWED AND
VOWED AGAIN IF THAT DEVIL BE KILLED ON HIS OWN DOORSTONES IN TRYING TO
PREVENT IT
HAPPILY I WAS SPARED THE JOURNEY AND THE TROUBLE
I HAD GONE
DOWN STAIRS AT THREE O'CLOCK TO FETCH A JUG OF WATER AND WAS PASSING
THROUGH THE HALL WITH IT IN MY HAND WHEN A SHARP KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR
MADE ME JUMP
'OH IT IS GREEN I SAID RECOLLECTING MYSELF 'ONLY
GREEN AND I WENT ON INTENDING TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE TO OPEN IT BUT
THE KNOCK WAS REPEATED NOT LOUD AND STILL IMPORTUNATELY
I PUT THE JUG
ON THE BANISTER AND HASTENED TO ADMIT HIM MYSELF
THE HARVEST MOON SHONE
CLEAR OUTSIDE
IT WAS NOT THE ATTORNEY
MY OWN SWEET LITTLE MISTRESS
SPRANG ON MY NECK SOBBING 'ELLEN ELLEN IS PAPA ALIVE
'YES I CRIED 'YES MY ANGEL HE IS GOD BE THANKED YOU ARE SAFE WITH
US AGAIN
SHE WANTED TO RUN BREATHLESS AS SHE WAS UP STAIRS TO MR
LINTON'S ROOM
BUT I COMPELLED HER TO SIT DOWN ON A CHAIR AND MADE HER DRINK AND
WASHED HER PALE FACE CHAFING IT INTO A FAINT COLOUR WITH MY APRON
THEN
I SAID I MUST GO FIRST AND TELL OF HER ARRIVAL IMPLORING HER TO SAY
SHE SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH YOUNG HEATHCLIFF
SHE STARED BUT SOON
COMPREHENDING WHY I COUNSELLED HER TO UTTER THE FALSEHOOD SHE ASSURED ME
SHE WOULD NOT COMPLAIN
I COULDN'T ABIDE TO BE PRESENT AT THEIR MEETING
I STOOD OUTSIDE THE
CHAMBER DOOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND HARDLY VENTURED NEAR THE BED
THEN
ALL WAS COMPOSED HOWEVER CATHERINE'S DESPAIR WAS AS SILENT AS
HER FATHER'S JOY
SHE SUPPORTED HIM CALMLY IN APPEARANCE AND HE FIXED
ON HER FEATURES HIS RAISED EYES THAT SEEMED DILATING WITH ECSTASY
HE DIED BLISSFULLY MR
LOCKWOOD HE DIED SO
KISSING HER CHEEK HE
MURMURED 'I AM GOING TO HER AND YOU DARLING CHILD SHALL COME TO US
AND NEVER STIRRED OR SPOKE AGAIN BUT CONTINUED THAT RAPT RADIANT GAZE
TILL HIS PULSE IMPERCEPTIBLY STOPPED AND HIS SOUL DEPARTED
NONE COULD
HAVE NOTICED THE EXACT MINUTE OF HIS DEATH IT WAS SO ENTIRELY WITHOUT A
STRUGGLE
WHETHER CATHERINE HAD SPENT HER TEARS OR WHETHER THE GRIEF WERE TOO
WEIGHTY TO LET THEM FLOW SHE SAT THERE DRY EYED TILL THE SUN ROSE SHE
SAT TILL NOON AND WOULD STILL HAVE REMAINED BROODING OVER THAT DEATHBED
BUT I INSISTED ON HER COMING AWAY AND TAKING SOME REPOSE
IT WAS WELL I
SUCCEEDED IN REMOVING HER FOR AT DINNER TIME APPEARED THE LAWYER HAVING
CALLED AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS TO GET HIS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO BEHAVE
HE
HAD SOLD HIMSELF TO MR
HEATHCLIFF THAT WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS DELAY IN
OBEYING MY MASTER'S SUMMONS
FORTUNATELY NO THOUGHT OF WORLDLY AFFAIRS
CROSSED THE LATTER'S MIND TO DISTURB HIM AFTER HIS DAUGHTER'S ARRIVAL
MR
GREEN TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO ORDER EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY ABOUT THE
PLACE
HE GAVE ALL THE SERVANTS BUT ME NOTICE TO QUIT
HE WOULD HAVE
CARRIED HIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE POINT OF INSISTING THAT EDGAR
LINTON SHOULD NOT BE BURIED BESIDE HIS WIFE BUT IN THE CHAPEL WITH HIS
FAMILY
THERE WAS THE WILL HOWEVER TO HINDER THAT AND MY LOUD
PROTESTATIONS AGAINST ANY INFRINGEMENT OF ITS DIRECTIONS
THE FUNERAL
WAS HURRIED OVER CATHERINE MRS
LINTON HEATHCLIFF NOW WAS SUFFERED TO
STAY AT THE GRANGE TILL HER FATHER'S CORPSE HAD QUITTED IT
SHE TOLD ME THAT HER ANGUISH HAD AT LAST SPURRED LINTON TO INCUR THE RISK
OF LIBERATING HER
SHE HEARD THE MEN I SENT DISPUTING AT THE DOOR AND
SHE GATHERED THE SENSE OF HEATHCLIFF'S ANSWER
IT DROVE HER DESPERATE
LINTON WHO HAD BEEN CONVEYED UP TO THE LITTLE PARLOUR SOON AFTER I LEFT
WAS TERRIFIED INTO FETCHING THE KEY BEFORE HIS FATHER RE ASCENDED
HE
HAD THE CUNNING TO UNLOCK AND RE LOCK THE DOOR WITHOUT SHUTTING IT AND
WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BED HE BEGGED TO SLEEP WITH HARETON AND HIS
PETITION WAS GRANTED FOR ONCE
CATHERINE STOLE OUT BEFORE BREAK OF DAY
SHE DARED NOT TRY THE DOORS LEST THE DOGS SHOULD RAISE AN ALARM SHE
VISITED THE EMPTY CHAMBERS AND EXAMINED THEIR WINDOWS AND LUCKILY
LIGHTING ON HER MOTHER'S SHE GOT EASILY OUT OF ITS LATTICE AND ON TO
THE GROUND BY MEANS OF THE FIR TREE CLOSE BY
HER ACCOMPLICE SUFFERED
FOR HIS SHARE IN THE ESCAPE NOTWITHSTANDING HIS TIMID CONTRIVANCES
CHAPTER XXIX
THE EVENING AFTER THE FUNERAL MY YOUNG LADY AND I WERE SEATED IN THE
LIBRARY NOW MUSING MOURNFULLY ONE OF US DESPAIRINGLY ON OUR LOSS NOW
VENTURING CONJECTURES AS TO THE GLOOMY FUTURE
WE HAD JUST AGREED THE BEST DESTINY WHICH COULD AWAIT CATHERINE WOULD BE
A PERMISSION TO CONTINUE RESIDENT AT THE GRANGE AT LEAST DURING LINTON'S
LIFE HE BEING ALLOWED TO JOIN HER THERE AND I TO REMAIN AS HOUSEKEEPER
THAT SEEMED RATHER TOO FAVOURABLE AN ARRANGEMENT TO BE HOPED FOR AND YET
I DID HOPE AND BEGAN TO CHEER UP UNDER THE PROSPECT OF RETAINING MY HOME
AND MY EMPLOYMENT AND ABOVE ALL MY BELOVED YOUNG MISTRESS WHEN A
SERVANT ONE OF THE DISCARDED ONES NOT YET DEPARTED RUSHED HASTILY IN
AND SAID 'THAT DEVIL HEATHCLIFF' WAS COMING THROUGH THE COURT SHOULD HE
FASTEN THE DOOR IN HIS FACE
IF WE HAD BEEN MAD ENOUGH TO ORDER THAT PROCEEDING WE HAD NOT TIME
HE
MADE NO CEREMONY OF KNOCKING OR ANNOUNCING HIS NAME HE WAS MASTER AND
AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE MASTER'S PRIVILEGE TO WALK STRAIGHT IN WITHOUT
SAYING A WORD
THE SOUND OF OUR INFORMANT'S VOICE DIRECTED HIM TO THE
LIBRARY HE ENTERED AND MOTIONING HIM OUT SHUT THE DOOR
IT WAS THE SAME ROOM INTO WHICH HE HAD BEEN USHERED AS A GUEST EIGHTEEN
YEARS BEFORE THE SAME MOON SHONE THROUGH THE WINDOW AND THE SAME AUTUMN
LANDSCAPE LAY OUTSIDE
WE HAD NOT YET LIGHTED A CANDLE BUT ALL THE
APARTMENT WAS VISIBLE EVEN TO THE PORTRAITS ON THE WALL THE SPLENDID
HEAD OF MRS
LINTON AND THE GRACEFUL ONE OF HER HUSBAND
HEATHCLIFF
ADVANCED TO THE HEARTH
TIME HAD LITTLE ALTERED HIS PERSON EITHER
THERE
WAS THE SAME MAN HIS DARK FACE RATHER SALLOWER AND MORE COMPOSED HIS
FRAME A STONE OR TWO HEAVIER PERHAPS AND NO OTHER DIFFERENCE
CATHERINE
HAD RISEN WITH AN IMPULSE TO DASH OUT WHEN SHE SAW HIM
'STOP HE SAID ARRESTING HER BY THE ARM
'NO MORE RUNNINGS AWAY WHERE
WOULD YOU GO I'M COME TO FETCH YOU HOME AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE A DUTIFUL
DAUGHTER AND NOT ENCOURAGE MY SON TO FURTHER DISOBEDIENCE
I WAS
EMBARRASSED HOW TO PUNISH HIM WHEN I DISCOVERED HIS PART IN THE BUSINESS
HE'S SUCH A COBWEB A PINCH WOULD ANNIHILATE HIM BUT YOU'LL SEE BY HIS
LOOK THAT HE HAS RECEIVED HIS DUE I BROUGHT HIM DOWN ONE EVENING THE
DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY AND JUST SET HIM IN A CHAIR AND NEVER TOUCHED HIM
AFTERWARDS
I SENT HARETON OUT AND WE HAD THE ROOM TO OURSELVES
IN
TWO HOURS I CALLED JOSEPH TO CARRY HIM UP AGAIN AND SINCE THEN MY
PRESENCE IS AS POTENT ON HIS NERVES AS A GHOST AND I FANCY HE SEES ME
OFTEN THOUGH I AM NOT NEAR
HARETON SAYS HE WAKES AND SHRIEKS IN THE
NIGHT BY THE HOUR TOGETHER AND CALLS YOU TO PROTECT HIM FROM ME AND
WHETHER YOU LIKE YOUR PRECIOUS MATE OR NOT YOU MUST COME HE'S YOUR
CONCERN NOW I YIELD ALL MY INTEREST IN HIM TO YOU
'WHY NOT LET CATHERINE CONTINUE HERE I PLEADED 'AND SEND MASTER LINTON
TO HER AS YOU HATE THEM BOTH YOU'D NOT MISS THEM THEY CAN ONLY BE A
DAILY PLAGUE TO YOUR UNNATURAL HEART
'I'M SEEKING A TENANT FOR THE GRANGE HE ANSWERED 'AND I WANT MY
CHILDREN ABOUT ME TO BE SURE
BESIDES THAT LASS OWES ME HER SERVICES
FOR HER BREAD
I'M NOT GOING TO NURTURE HER IN LUXURY AND IDLENESS AFTER
LINTON IS GONE
MAKE HASTE AND GET READY NOW AND DON'T OBLIGE ME TO
COMPEL YOU
'I SHALL SAID CATHERINE
'LINTON IS ALL I HAVE TO LOVE IN THE WORLD
AND THOUGH YOU HAVE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO MAKE HIM HATEFUL TO ME AND ME
TO HIM YOU CANNOT MAKE US HATE EACH OTHER
AND I DEFY YOU TO HURT HIM
WHEN I AM BY AND I DEFY YOU TO FRIGHTEN ME
'YOU ARE A BOASTFUL CHAMPION REPLIED HEATHCLIFF 'BUT I DON'T LIKE YOU
WELL ENOUGH TO HURT HIM YOU SHALL GET THE FULL BENEFIT OF THE TORMENT
AS LONG AS IT LASTS
IT IS NOT I WHO WILL MAKE HIM HATEFUL TO YOU IT IS
HIS OWN SWEET SPIRIT
HE'S AS BITTER AS GALL AT YOUR DESERTION AND ITS
CONSEQUENCES DON'T EXPECT THANKS FOR THIS NOBLE DEVOTION
I HEARD HIM
DRAW A PLEASANT PICTURE TO ZILLAH OF WHAT HE WOULD DO IF HE WERE AS
STRONG AS I THE INCLINATION IS THERE AND HIS VERY WEAKNESS WILL SHARPEN
HIS WITS TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR STRENGTH
'I KNOW HE HAS A BAD NATURE SAID CATHERINE 'HE'S YOUR SON
BUT I'M
GLAD I'VE A BETTER TO FORGIVE IT AND I KNOW HE LOVES ME AND FOR THAT
REASON I LOVE HIM
MR
HEATHCLIFF YOU HAVE NOBODY TO LOVE YOU AND
HOWEVER MISERABLE YOU MAKE US WE SHALL STILL HAVE THE REVENGE OF
THINKING THAT YOUR CRUELTY ARISES FROM YOUR GREATER MISERY
YOU ARE
MISERABLE ARE YOU NOT LONELY LIKE THE DEVIL AND ENVIOUS LIKE HIM
NOBODY LOVES YOU NOBODY WILL CRY FOR YOU WHEN YOU DIE I WOULDN'T
BE YOU
CATHERINE SPOKE WITH A KIND OF DREARY TRIUMPH SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MADE UP
HER MIND TO ENTER INTO THE SPIRIT OF HER FUTURE FAMILY AND DRAW PLEASURE
FROM THE GRIEFS OF HER ENEMIES
'YOU SHALL BE SORRY TO BE YOURSELF PRESENTLY SAID HER FATHER IN LAW
'IF YOU STAND THERE ANOTHER MINUTE
BEGONE WITCH AND GET YOUR THINGS
SHE SCORNFULLY WITHDREW
IN HER ABSENCE I BEGAN TO BEG FOR ZILLAH'S
PLACE AT THE HEIGHTS OFFERING TO RESIGN MINE TO HER BUT HE WOULD SUFFER
IT ON NO ACCOUNT
HE BID ME BE SILENT AND THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
ALLOWED HIMSELF A GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM AND A LOOK AT THE PICTURES
HAVING STUDIED MRS
LINTON'S HE SAID 'I SHALL HAVE THAT HOME
NOT
BECAUSE I NEED IT BUT HE TURNED ABRUPTLY TO THE FIRE AND CONTINUED
WITH WHAT FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD I MUST CALL A SMILE 'I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I DID YESTERDAY I GOT THE SEXTON WHO WAS DIGGING LINTON'S GRAVE
TO REMOVE THE EARTH OFF HER COFFIN LID AND I OPENED IT
I THOUGHT
ONCE I WOULD HAVE STAYED THERE WHEN I SAW HER FACE AGAIN IT IS HERS
YET HE HAD HARD WORK TO STIR ME BUT HE SAID IT WOULD CHANGE IF THE AIR
BLEW ON IT AND SO I STRUCK ONE SIDE OF THE COFFIN LOOSE AND COVERED IT
UP NOT LINTON'S SIDE DAMN HIM I WISH HE'D BEEN SOLDERED IN LEAD
AND
I BRIBED THE SEXTON TO PULL IT AWAY WHEN I'M LAID THERE AND SLIDE MINE
OUT TOO I'LL HAVE IT MADE SO AND THEN BY THE TIME LINTON GETS TO US
HE'LL NOT KNOW WHICH IS WHICH
'YOU WERE VERY WICKED MR
HEATHCLIFF I EXCLAIMED 'WERE YOU NOT
ASHAMED TO DISTURB THE DEAD
'I DISTURBED NOBODY NELLY HE REPLIED 'AND I GAVE SOME EASE TO MYSELF
I SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL MORE COMFORTABLE NOW AND YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER
CHANCE OF KEEPING ME UNDERGROUND WHEN I GET THERE
DISTURBED HER NO
SHE HAS DISTURBED ME NIGHT AND DAY THROUGH EIGHTEEN
YEARS INCESSANTLY REMORSELESSLY TILL YESTERNIGHT AND YESTERNIGHT I
WAS TRANQUIL
I DREAMT I WAS SLEEPING THE LAST SLEEP BY THAT SLEEPER
WITH MY HEART STOPPED AND MY CHEEK FROZEN AGAINST HERS
'AND IF SHE HAD BEEN DISSOLVED INTO EARTH OR WORSE WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
DREAMT OF THEN I SAID
'OF DISSOLVING WITH HER AND BEING MORE HAPPY STILL HE ANSWERED
'DO
YOU SUPPOSE I DREAD ANY CHANGE OF THAT SORT I EXPECTED SUCH A
TRANSFORMATION ON RAISING THE LID BUT I'M BETTER PLEASED THAT IT SHOULD
NOT COMMENCE TILL I SHARE IT
BESIDES UNLESS I HAD RECEIVED A DISTINCT
IMPRESSION OF HER PASSIONLESS FEATURES THAT STRANGE FEELING WOULD HARDLY
HAVE BEEN REMOVED
IT BEGAN ODDLY
YOU KNOW I WAS WILD AFTER SHE DIED
AND ETERNALLY FROM DAWN TO DAWN PRAYING HER TO RETURN TO ME HER SPIRIT
I HAVE A STRONG FAITH IN GHOSTS I HAVE A CONVICTION THAT THEY CAN AND
DO EXIST AMONG US THE DAY SHE WAS BURIED THERE CAME A FALL OF SNOW
IN THE EVENING I WENT TO THE CHURCHYARD
IT BLEW BLEAK AS WINTER ALL
ROUND WAS SOLITARY
I DIDN'T FEAR THAT HER FOOL OF A HUSBAND WOULD
WANDER UP THE GLEN SO LATE AND NO ONE ELSE HAD BUSINESS TO BRING THEM
THERE
BEING ALONE AND CONSCIOUS TWO YARDS OF LOOSE EARTH WAS THE SOLE
BARRIER BETWEEN US I SAID TO MYSELF I'LL HAVE HER IN MY ARMS AGAIN IF
SHE BE COLD I'LL THINK IT IS THIS NORTH WIND THAT CHILLS ME AND IF
SHE BE MOTIONLESS IT IS SLEEP I GOT A SPADE FROM THE TOOL HOUSE AND
BEGAN TO DELVE WITH ALL MY MIGHT IT SCRAPED THE COFFIN I FELL TO WORK
WITH MY HANDS THE WOOD COMMENCED CRACKING ABOUT THE SCREWS I WAS ON THE
POINT OF ATTAINING MY OBJECT WHEN IT SEEMED THAT I HEARD A SIGH FROM
SOME ONE ABOVE CLOSE AT THE EDGE OF THE GRAVE AND BENDING DOWN
IF I
CAN ONLY GET THIS OFF I MUTTERED I WISH THEY MAY SHOVEL IN THE EARTH
OVER US BOTH AND I WRENCHED AT IT MORE DESPERATELY STILL
THERE WAS
ANOTHER SIGH CLOSE AT MY EAR
I APPEARED TO FEEL THE WARM BREATH OF IT
DISPLACING THE SLEET LADEN WIND
I KNEW NO LIVING THING IN FLESH AND
BLOOD WAS BY BUT AS CERTAINLY AS YOU PERCEIVE THE APPROACH TO SOME
SUBSTANTIAL BODY IN THE DARK THOUGH IT CANNOT BE DISCERNED SO CERTAINLY
I FELT THAT CATHY WAS THERE NOT UNDER ME BUT ON THE EARTH
A SUDDEN
SENSE OF RELIEF FLOWED FROM MY HEART THROUGH EVERY LIMB
I RELINQUISHED
MY LABOUR OF AGONY AND TURNED CONSOLED AT ONCE UNSPEAKABLY CONSOLED
HER PRESENCE WAS WITH ME IT REMAINED WHILE I RE FILLED THE GRAVE AND
LED ME HOME
YOU MAY LAUGH IF YOU WILL BUT I WAS SURE I SHOULD SEE HER
THERE
I WAS SURE SHE WAS WITH ME AND I COULD NOT HELP TALKING TO HER
HAVING REACHED THE HEIGHTS I RUSHED EAGERLY TO THE DOOR
IT WAS
FASTENED AND I REMEMBER THAT ACCURSED EARNSHAW AND MY WIFE OPPOSED MY
ENTRANCE
I REMEMBER STOPPING TO KICK THE BREATH OUT OF HIM AND THEN
HURRYING UP STAIRS TO MY ROOM AND HERS
I LOOKED ROUND IMPATIENTLY I
FELT HER BY ME I COULD ALMOST SEE HER AND YET I COULD NOT I OUGHT
TO HAVE SWEAT BLOOD THEN FROM THE ANGUISH OF MY YEARNING FROM THE
FERVOUR OF MY SUPPLICATIONS TO HAVE BUT ONE GLIMPSE I HAD NOT ONE
SHE
SHOWED HERSELF AS SHE OFTEN WAS IN LIFE A DEVIL TO ME AND SINCE
THEN SOMETIMES MORE AND SOMETIMES LESS I'VE BEEN THE SPORT OF THAT
INTOLERABLE TORTURE INFERNAL KEEPING MY NERVES AT SUCH A STRETCH THAT
IF THEY HAD NOT RESEMBLED CATGUT THEY WOULD LONG AGO HAVE RELAXED TO THE
FEEBLENESS OF LINTON'S
WHEN I SAT IN THE HOUSE WITH HARETON IT SEEMED
THAT ON GOING OUT I SHOULD MEET HER WHEN I WALKED ON THE MOORS I SHOULD
MEET HER COMING IN
WHEN I WENT FROM HOME I HASTENED TO RETURN SHE
MUST BE SOMEWHERE AT THE HEIGHTS I WAS CERTAIN AND WHEN I SLEPT IN
HER CHAMBER I WAS BEATEN OUT OF THAT
I COULDN'T LIE THERE FOR THE
MOMENT I CLOSED MY EYES SHE WAS EITHER OUTSIDE THE WINDOW OR SLIDING
BACK THE PANELS OR ENTERING THE ROOM OR EVEN RESTING HER DARLING HEAD
ON THE SAME PILLOW AS SHE DID WHEN A CHILD AND I MUST OPEN MY LIDS TO
SEE
AND SO I OPENED AND CLOSED THEM A HUNDRED TIMES A NIGHT TO BE
ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED IT RACKED ME I'VE OFTEN GROANED ALOUD TILL THAT
OLD RASCAL JOSEPH NO DOUBT BELIEVED THAT MY CONSCIENCE WAS PLAYING THE
FIEND INSIDE OF ME
NOW SINCE I'VE SEEN HER I'M PACIFIED A LITTLE
IT
WAS A STRANGE WAY OF KILLING NOT BY INCHES BUT BY FRACTIONS OF
HAIRBREADTHS TO BEGUILE ME WITH THE SPECTRE OF A HOPE THROUGH EIGHTEEN
YEARS
MR
HEATHCLIFF PAUSED AND WIPED HIS FOREHEAD HIS HAIR CLUNG TO IT WET
WITH PERSPIRATION HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE RED EMBERS OF THE FIRE THE
BROWS NOT CONTRACTED BUT RAISED NEXT THE TEMPLES DIMINISHING THE GRIM
ASPECT OF HIS COUNTENANCE BUT IMPARTING A PECULIAR LOOK OF TROUBLE AND
A PAINFUL APPEARANCE OF MENTAL TENSION TOWARDS ONE ABSORBING SUBJECT
HE
ONLY HALF ADDRESSED ME AND I MAINTAINED SILENCE
I DIDN'T LIKE TO HEAR
HIM TALK AFTER A SHORT PERIOD HE RESUMED HIS MEDITATION ON THE PICTURE
TOOK IT DOWN AND LEANT IT AGAINST THE SOFA TO CONTEMPLATE IT AT BETTER
ADVANTAGE AND WHILE SO OCCUPIED CATHERINE ENTERED ANNOUNCING THAT SHE
WAS READY WHEN HER PONY SHOULD BE SADDLED
'SEND THAT OVER TO MORROW SAID HEATHCLIFF TO ME THEN TURNING TO HER
HE ADDED 'YOU MAY DO WITHOUT YOUR PONY IT IS A FINE EVENING AND YOU'LL
NEED NO PONIES AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS FOR WHAT JOURNEYS YOU TAKE YOUR OWN
FEET WILL SERVE YOU
COME ALONG
'GOOD BYE ELLEN WHISPERED MY DEAR LITTLE MISTRESS
AS SHE KISSED ME HER LIPS FELT LIKE ICE
'COME AND SEE ME ELLEN DON'T
FORGET
'TAKE CARE YOU DO NO SUCH THING MRS
DEAN SAID HER NEW FATHER
'WHEN
I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU I'LL COME HERE
I WANT NONE OF YOUR PRYING AT MY
HOUSE
HE SIGNED HER TO PRECEDE HIM AND CASTING BACK A LOOK THAT CUT MY HEART
SHE OBEYED
I WATCHED THEM FROM THE WINDOW WALK DOWN THE GARDEN
HEATHCLIFF FIXED CATHERINE'S ARM UNDER HIS THOUGH SHE DISPUTED THE ACT
AT FIRST EVIDENTLY AND WITH RAPID STRIDES HE HURRIED HER INTO THE ALLEY
WHOSE TREES CONCEALED THEM
CHAPTER XXX
I HAVE PAID A VISIT TO THE HEIGHTS BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN HER SINCE SHE
LEFT JOSEPH HELD THE DOOR IN HIS HAND WHEN I CALLED TO ASK AFTER HER
AND WOULDN'T LET ME PASS
HE SAID MRS
LINTON WAS 'THRANG AND THE
MASTER WAS NOT IN
ZILLAH HAS TOLD ME SOMETHING OF THE WAY THEY GO ON
OTHERWISE I SHOULD HARDLY KNOW WHO WAS DEAD AND WHO LIVING
SHE THINKS
CATHERINE HAUGHTY AND DOES NOT LIKE HER I CAN GUESS BY HER TALK
MY
YOUNG LADY ASKED SOME AID OF HER WHEN SHE FIRST CAME BUT MR
HEATHCLIFF
TOLD HER TO FOLLOW HER OWN BUSINESS AND LET HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW LOOK
AFTER HERSELF AND ZILLAH WILLINGLY ACQUIESCED BEING A NARROW MINDED
SELFISH WOMAN
CATHERINE EVINCED A CHILD'S ANNOYANCE AT THIS NEGLECT
REPAID IT WITH CONTEMPT AND THUS ENLISTED MY INFORMANT AMONG HER
ENEMIES AS SECURELY AS IF SHE HAD DONE HER SOME GREAT WRONG
I HAD A
LONG TALK WITH ZILLAH ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO A LITTLE BEFORE YOU CAME ONE
DAY WHEN WE FOREGATHERED ON THE MOOR AND THIS IS WHAT SHE TOLD ME
'THE FIRST THING MRS
LINTON DID SHE SAID 'ON HER ARRIVAL AT THE
HEIGHTS WAS TO RUN UP STAIRS WITHOUT EVEN WISHING GOOD EVENING TO ME
AND JOSEPH SHE SHUT HERSELF INTO LINTON'S ROOM AND REMAINED TILL
MORNING
THEN WHILE THE MASTER AND EARNSHAW WERE AT BREAKFAST SHE
ENTERED THE HOUSE AND ASKED ALL IN A QUIVER IF THE DOCTOR MIGHT BE SENT
FOR HER COUSIN WAS VERY ILL
WE KNOW THAT ANSWERED HEATHCLIFF BUT HIS LIFE IS NOT WORTH A
FARTHING AND I WON'T SPEND A FARTHING ON HIM
BUT I CANNOT TELL HOW TO DO SHE SAID AND IF NOBODY WILL HELP ME
HE'LL DIE
WALK OUT OF THE ROOM CRIED THE MASTER AND LET ME NEVER HEAR A WORD
MORE ABOUT HIM NONE HERE CARE WHAT BECOMES OF HIM IF YOU DO ACT THE
NURSE IF YOU DO NOT LOCK HIM UP AND LEAVE HIM
'THEN SHE BEGAN TO BOTHER ME AND I SAID I'D HAD ENOUGH PLAGUE WITH THE
TIRESOME THING WE EACH HAD OUR TASKS AND HERS WAS TO WAIT ON LINTON
MR
HEATHCLIFF BID ME LEAVE THAT LABOUR TO HER
'HOW THEY MANAGED TOGETHER I CAN'T TELL
I FANCY HE FRETTED A GREAT
DEAL AND MOANED HISSELN NIGHT AND DAY AND SHE HAD PRECIOUS LITTLE REST
ONE COULD GUESS BY HER WHITE FACE AND HEAVY EYES
SHE SOMETIMES CAME
INTO THE KITCHEN ALL WILDERED LIKE AND LOOKED AS IF SHE WOULD FAIN BEG
ASSISTANCE BUT I WAS NOT GOING TO DISOBEY THE MASTER I NEVER DARE
DISOBEY HIM MRS
DEAN AND THOUGH I THOUGHT IT WRONG THAT KENNETH
SHOULD NOT BE SENT FOR IT WAS NO CONCERN OF MINE EITHER TO ADVISE OR
COMPLAIN AND I ALWAYS REFUSED TO MEDDLE
ONCE OR TWICE AFTER WE HAD
GONE TO BED I'VE HAPPENED TO OPEN MY DOOR AGAIN AND SEEN HER SITTING
CRYING ON THE STAIRS' TOP AND THEN I'VE SHUT MYSELF IN QUICK FOR FEAR
OF BEING MOVED TO INTERFERE
I DID PITY HER THEN I'M SURE STILL I
DIDN'T WISH TO LOSE MY PLACE YOU KNOW
'AT LAST ONE NIGHT SHE CAME BOLDLY INTO MY CHAMBER AND FRIGHTENED ME
OUT OF MY WITS BY SAYING TELL MR
HEATHCLIFF THAT HIS SON IS DYING I'M
SURE HE IS THIS TIME
GET UP INSTANTLY AND TELL HIM
'HAVING UTTERED THIS SPEECH SHE VANISHED AGAIN
I LAY A QUARTER OF AN
HOUR LISTENING AND TREMBLING
NOTHING STIRRED THE HOUSE WAS QUIET
'SHE'S MISTAKEN I SAID TO MYSELF
HE'S GOT OVER IT
I NEEDN'T DISTURB
THEM AND I BEGAN TO DOZE
BUT MY SLEEP WAS MARRED A SECOND TIME BY A
SHARP RINGING OF THE BELL THE ONLY BELL WE HAVE PUT UP ON PURPOSE FOR
LINTON AND THE MASTER CALLED TO ME TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND
INFORM THEM THAT HE WOULDN'T HAVE THAT NOISE REPEATED
'I DELIVERED CATHERINE'S MESSAGE
HE CURSED TO HIMSELF AND IN A FEW
MINUTES CAME OUT WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE AND PROCEEDED TO THEIR ROOM
I
FOLLOWED
MRS
HEATHCLIFF WAS SEATED BY THE BEDSIDE WITH HER HANDS
FOLDED ON HER KNEES
HER FATHER IN LAW WENT UP HELD THE LIGHT TO
LINTON'S FACE LOOKED AT HIM AND TOUCHED HIM AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO
HER
NOW CATHERINE HE SAID HOW DO YOU FEEL
'SHE WAS DUMB
HOW DO YOU FEEL CATHERINE HE REPEATED
HE'S SAFE AND I'M FREE SHE ANSWERED I SHOULD FEEL WELL BUT SHE
CONTINUED WITH A BITTERNESS SHE COULDN'T CONCEAL YOU HAVE LEFT ME SO
LONG TO STRUGGLE AGAINST DEATH ALONE THAT I FEEL AND SEE ONLY DEATH I
FEEL LIKE DEATH
'AND SHE LOOKED LIKE IT TOO I GAVE HER A LITTLE WINE
HARETON AND
JOSEPH WHO HAD BEEN WAKENED BY THE RINGING AND THE SOUND OF FEET AND
HEARD OUR TALK FROM OUTSIDE NOW ENTERED
JOSEPH WAS FAIN I BELIEVE OF
THE LAD'S REMOVAL HARETON SEEMED A THOUGHT BOTHERED THOUGH HE WAS MORE
TAKEN UP WITH STARING AT CATHERINE THAN THINKING OF LINTON
BUT THE
MASTER BID HIM GET OFF TO BED AGAIN WE DIDN'T WANT HIS HELP
HE
AFTERWARDS MADE JOSEPH REMOVE THE BODY TO HIS CHAMBER AND TOLD ME TO
RETURN TO MINE AND MRS
HEATHCLIFF REMAINED BY HERSELF
'IN THE MORNING HE SENT ME TO TELL HER SHE MUST COME DOWN TO BREAKFAST
SHE HAD UNDRESSED AND APPEARED GOING TO SLEEP AND SAID SHE WAS ILL AT
WHICH I HARDLY WONDERED
I INFORMED MR
HEATHCLIFF AND HE
REPLIED WELL LET HER BE TILL AFTER THE FUNERAL AND GO UP NOW AND
THEN TO GET HER WHAT IS NEEDFUL AND AS SOON AS SHE SEEMS BETTER TELL
ME
CATHY STAYED UPSTAIRS A FORTNIGHT ACCORDING TO ZILLAH WHO VISITED HER
TWICE A DAY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN RATHER MORE FRIENDLY BUT HER ATTEMPTS
AT INCREASING KINDNESS WERE PROUDLY AND PROMPTLY REPELLED
HEATHCLIFF WENT UP ONCE TO SHOW HER LINTON'S WILL
HE HAD BEQUEATHED
THE WHOLE OF HIS AND WHAT HAD BEEN HER MOVEABLE PROPERTY TO HIS
FATHER THE POOR CREATURE WAS THREATENED OR COAXED INTO THAT ACT DURING
HER WEEK'S ABSENCE WHEN HIS UNCLE DIED
THE LANDS BEING A MINOR HE
COULD NOT MEDDLE WITH
HOWEVER MR
HEATHCLIFF HAS CLAIMED AND KEPT THEM
IN HIS WIFE'S RIGHT AND HIS ALSO I SUPPOSE LEGALLY AT ANY RATE
CATHERINE DESTITUTE OF CASH AND FRIENDS CANNOT DISTURB HIS POSSESSION
'NOBODY SAID ZILLAH 'EVER APPROACHED HER DOOR EXCEPT THAT ONCE BUT
I AND NOBODY ASKED ANYTHING ABOUT HER
THE FIRST OCCASION OF HER COMING
DOWN INTO THE HOUSE WAS ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON
SHE HAD CRIED OUT WHEN I
CARRIED UP HER DINNER THAT SHE COULDN'T BEAR ANY LONGER BEING IN THE
COLD AND I TOLD HER THE MASTER WAS GOING TO THRUSHCROSS GRANGE AND
EARNSHAW AND I NEEDN'T HINDER HER FROM DESCENDING SO AS SOON AS SHE
HEARD HEATHCLIFF'S HORSE TROT OFF SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE DONNED IN
BLACK AND HER YELLOW CURLS COMBED BACK BEHIND HER EARS AS PLAIN AS A
QUAKER SHE COULDN'T COMB THEM OUT
'JOSEPH AND I GENERALLY GO TO CHAPEL ON SUNDAYS THE KIRK YOU KNOW HAS
NO MINISTER NOW EXPLAINED MRS
DEAN AND THEY CALL THE METHODISTS' OR
BAPTISTS' PLACE I CAN'T SAY WHICH IT IS AT GIMMERTON A CHAPEL
'JOSEPH
HAD GONE SHE CONTINUED 'BUT I THOUGHT PROPER TO BIDE AT HOME
YOUNG
FOLKS ARE ALWAYS THE BETTER FOR AN ELDER'S OVER LOOKING AND HARETON
WITH ALL HIS BASHFULNESS ISN'T A MODEL OF NICE BEHAVIOUR
I LET HIM
KNOW THAT HIS COUSIN WOULD VERY LIKELY SIT WITH US AND SHE HAD BEEN
ALWAYS USED TO SEE THE SABBATH RESPECTED SO HE HAD AS GOOD LEAVE HIS
GUNS AND BITS OF INDOOR WORK ALONE WHILE SHE STAYED
HE COLOURED UP AT
THE NEWS AND CAST HIS EYES OVER HIS HANDS AND CLOTHES
THE TRAIN OIL
AND GUNPOWDER WERE SHOVED OUT OF SIGHT IN A MINUTE
I SAW HE MEANT TO
GIVE HER HIS COMPANY AND I GUESSED BY HIS WAY HE WANTED TO BE
PRESENTABLE SO LAUGHING AS I DURST NOT LAUGH WHEN THE MASTER IS BY I
OFFERED TO HELP HIM IF HE WOULD AND JOKED AT HIS CONFUSION
HE GREW
SULLEN AND BEGAN TO SWEAR
'NOW MRS
DEAN ZILLAH WENT ON SEEING ME NOT PLEASED BY HER MANNER
'YOU HAPPEN THINK YOUR YOUNG LADY TOO FINE FOR MR
HARETON AND HAPPEN
YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I OWN I SHOULD LOVE WELL TO BRING HER PRIDE A PEG
LOWER
AND WHAT WILL ALL HER LEARNING AND HER DAINTINESS DO FOR HER
NOW SHE'S AS POOR AS YOU OR I POORER I'LL BE BOUND YOU'RE SAYING
AND I'M DOING MY LITTLE ALL THAT ROAD
HARETON ALLOWED ZILLAH TO GIVE HIM HER AID AND SHE FLATTERED HIM INTO A
GOOD HUMOUR SO WHEN CATHERINE CAME HALF FORGETTING HER FORMER INSULTS
HE TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE BY THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ACCOUNT
'MISSIS WALKED IN SHE SAID 'AS CHILL AS AN ICICLE AND AS HIGH AS A
PRINCESS
I GOT UP AND OFFERED HER MY SEAT IN THE ARM CHAIR
NO SHE
TURNED UP HER NOSE AT MY CIVILITY
EARNSHAW ROSE TOO AND BID HER COME
TO THE SETTLE AND SIT CLOSE BY THE FIRE HE WAS SURE SHE WAS STARVED
I'VE BEEN STARVED A MONTH AND MORE SHE ANSWERED RESTING ON THE WORD
AS SCORNFUL AS SHE COULD
'AND SHE GOT A CHAIR FOR HERSELF AND PLACED IT AT A DISTANCE FROM BOTH
OF US
HAVING SAT TILL SHE WAS WARM SHE BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND AND
DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF BOOKS ON THE DRESSER SHE WAS INSTANTLY UPON HER
FEET AGAIN STRETCHING TO REACH THEM BUT THEY WERE TOO HIGH UP
HER
COUSIN AFTER WATCHING HER ENDEAVOURS A WHILE AT LAST SUMMONED COURAGE
TO HELP HER SHE HELD HER FROCK AND HE FILLED IT WITH THE FIRST THAT
CAME TO HAND
'THAT WAS A GREAT ADVANCE FOR THE LAD
SHE DIDN'T THANK HIM STILL HE
FELT GRATIFIED THAT SHE HAD ACCEPTED HIS ASSISTANCE AND VENTURED TO
STAND BEHIND AS SHE EXAMINED THEM AND EVEN TO STOOP AND POINT OUT WHAT
STRUCK HIS FANCY IN CERTAIN OLD PICTURES WHICH THEY CONTAINED NOR WAS HE
DAUNTED BY THE SAUCY STYLE IN WHICH SHE JERKED THE PAGE FROM HIS FINGER
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH GOING A BIT FARTHER BACK AND LOOKING AT HER
INSTEAD OF THE BOOK
SHE CONTINUED READING OR SEEKING FOR SOMETHING TO
READ
HIS ATTENTION BECAME BY DEGREES QUITE CENTRED IN THE STUDY OF
HER THICK SILKY CURLS HER FACE HE COULDN'T SEE AND SHE COULDN'T SEE
HIM
AND PERHAPS NOT QUITE AWAKE TO WHAT HE DID BUT ATTRACTED LIKE A
CHILD TO A CANDLE AT LAST HE PROCEEDED FROM STARING TO TOUCHING HE PUT
OUT HIS HAND AND STROKED ONE CURL AS GENTLY AS IF IT WERE A BIRD
HE
MIGHT HAVE STUCK A KNIFE INTO HER NECK SHE STARTED ROUND IN SUCH A
TAKING
GET AWAY THIS MOMENT HOW DARE YOU TOUCH ME WHY ARE YOU STOPPING
THERE SHE CRIED IN A TONE OF DISGUST
I CAN'T ENDURE YOU I'LL GO
UPSTAIRS AGAIN IF YOU COME NEAR ME
'MR
HARETON RECOILED LOOKING AS FOOLISH AS HE COULD DO HE SAT DOWN IN
THE SETTLE VERY QUIET AND SHE CONTINUED TURNING OVER HER VOLUMES ANOTHER
HALF HOUR FINALLY EARNSHAW CROSSED OVER AND WHISPERED TO ME
WILL YOU ASK HER TO READ TO US ZILLAH I'M STALLED OF DOING NAUGHT
AND I DO LIKE I COULD LIKE TO HEAR HER DUNNOT SAY I WANTED IT BUT ASK
OF YOURSELN
MR
HARETON WISHES YOU WOULD READ TO US MA'AM I SAID IMMEDIATELY
HE'D TAKE IT VERY KIND HE'D BE MUCH OBLIGED
'SHE FROWNED AND LOOKING UP ANSWERED
MR
HARETON AND THE WHOLE SET OF YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO
UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT ANY PRETENCE AT KINDNESS YOU HAVE THE HYPOCRISY
TO OFFER I DESPISE YOU AND WILL HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ANY OF YOU
WHEN I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY LIFE FOR ONE KIND WORD EVEN TO SEE ONE OF
YOUR FACES YOU ALL KEPT OFF
BUT I WON'T COMPLAIN TO YOU I'M DRIVEN
DOWN HERE BY THE COLD NOT EITHER TO AMUSE YOU OR ENJOY YOUR SOCIETY
WHAT COULD I HA' DONE BEGAN EARNSHAW
HOW WAS I TO BLAME
OH YOU ARE AN EXCEPTION ANSWERED MRS
HEATHCLIFF
I NEVER MISSED
SUCH A CONCERN AS YOU
BUT I OFFERED MORE THAN ONCE AND ASKED HE SAID KINDLING UP AT HER
PERTNESS I ASKED MR
HEATHCLIFF TO LET ME WAKE FOR YOU
BE SILENT I'LL GO OUT OF DOORS OR ANYWHERE RATHER THAN HAVE YOUR
DISAGREEABLE VOICE IN MY EAR SAID MY LADY
'HARETON MUTTERED SHE MIGHT GO TO HELL FOR HIM AND UNSLINGING HIS GUN
RESTRAINED HIMSELF FROM HIS SUNDAY OCCUPATIONS NO LONGER
HE TALKED NOW
FREELY ENOUGH AND SHE PRESENTLY SAW FIT TO RETREAT TO HER SOLITUDE BUT
THE FROST HAD SET IN AND IN SPITE OF HER PRIDE SHE WAS FORCED TO
CONDESCEND TO OUR COMPANY MORE AND MORE
HOWEVER I TOOK CARE THERE
SHOULD BE NO FURTHER SCORNING AT MY GOOD NATURE EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN AS
STIFF AS HERSELF AND SHE HAS NO LOVER OR LIKER AMONG US AND SHE DOES
NOT DESERVE ONE FOR LET THEM SAY THE LEAST WORD TO HER AND SHE'LL CURL
BACK WITHOUT RESPECT OF ANY ONE
SHE'LL SNAP AT THE MASTER HIMSELF AND
AS GOOD AS DARES HIM TO THRASH HER AND THE MORE HURT SHE GETS THE MORE
VENOMOUS SHE GROWS
AT FIRST ON HEARING THIS ACCOUNT FROM ZILLAH I DETERMINED TO LEAVE MY
SITUATION TAKE A COTTAGE AND GET CATHERINE TO COME AND LIVE WITH ME
BUT MR
HEATHCLIFF WOULD AS SOON PERMIT THAT AS HE WOULD SET UP HARETON
IN AN INDEPENDENT HOUSE AND I CAN SEE NO REMEDY AT PRESENT UNLESS SHE
COULD MARRY AGAIN AND THAT SCHEME IT DOES NOT COME WITHIN MY PROVINCE TO
ARRANGE
THUS ENDED MRS
DEAN'S STORY
NOTWITHSTANDING THE DOCTOR'S PROPHECY I
AM RAPIDLY RECOVERING STRENGTH AND THOUGH IT BE ONLY THE SECOND WEEK IN
JANUARY I PROPOSE GETTING OUT ON HORSEBACK IN A DAY OR TWO AND RIDING
OVER TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS TO INFORM MY LANDLORD THAT I SHALL SPEND THE
NEXT SIX MONTHS IN LONDON AND IF HE LIKES HE MAY LOOK OUT FOR ANOTHER
TENANT TO TAKE THE PLACE AFTER OCTOBER
I WOULD NOT PASS ANOTHER WINTER
HERE FOR MUCH
CHAPTER XXXI
YESTERDAY WAS BRIGHT CALM AND FROSTY
I WENT TO THE HEIGHTS AS I
PROPOSED MY HOUSEKEEPER ENTREATED ME TO BEAR A LITTLE NOTE FROM HER TO
HER YOUNG LADY AND I DID NOT REFUSE FOR THE WORTHY WOMAN WAS NOT
CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING ODD IN HER REQUEST
THE FRONT DOOR STOOD OPEN BUT
THE JEALOUS GATE WAS FASTENED AS AT MY LAST VISIT I KNOCKED AND INVOKED
EARNSHAW FROM AMONG THE GARDEN BEDS HE UNCHAINED IT AND I ENTERED
THE
FELLOW IS AS HANDSOME A RUSTIC AS NEED BE SEEN
I TOOK PARTICULAR NOTICE
OF HIM THIS TIME BUT THEN HE DOES HIS BEST APPARENTLY TO MAKE THE LEAST
OF HIS ADVANTAGES
I ASKED IF MR
HEATHCLIFF WERE AT HOME HE ANSWERED NO BUT HE WOULD BE
IN AT DINNER TIME
IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK AND I ANNOUNCED MY INTENTION
OF GOING IN AND WAITING FOR HIM AT WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY FLUNG DOWN HIS
TOOLS AND ACCOMPANIED ME IN THE OFFICE OF WATCHDOG NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE
FOR THE HOST
WE ENTERED TOGETHER CATHERINE WAS THERE MAKING HERSELF USEFUL IN
PREPARING SOME VEGETABLES FOR THE APPROACHING MEAL SHE LOOKED MORE
SULKY AND LESS SPIRITED THAN WHEN I HAD SEEN HER FIRST
SHE HARDLY
RAISED HER EYES TO NOTICE ME AND CONTINUED HER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE SAME
DISREGARD TO COMMON FORMS OF POLITENESS AS BEFORE NEVER RETURNING MY
BOW AND GOOD MORNING BY THE SLIGHTEST ACKNOWLEDGMENT
'SHE DOES NOT SEEM SO AMIABLE I THOUGHT 'AS MRS
DEAN WOULD PERSUADE
ME TO BELIEVE
SHE'S A BEAUTY IT IS TRUE BUT NOT AN ANGEL
EARNSHAW SURLILY BID HER REMOVE HER THINGS TO THE KITCHEN
'REMOVE THEM
YOURSELF SHE SAID PUSHING THEM FROM HER AS SOON AS SHE HAD DONE AND
RETIRING TO A STOOL BY THE WINDOW WHERE SHE BEGAN TO CARVE FIGURES OF
BIRDS AND BEASTS OUT OF THE TURNIP PARINGS IN HER LAP
I APPROACHED HER
PRETENDING TO DESIRE A VIEW OF THE GARDEN AND AS I FANCIED ADROITLY
DROPPED MRS
DEAN'S NOTE ON TO HER KNEE UNNOTICED BY HARETON BUT SHE
ASKED ALOUD 'WHAT IS THAT AND CHUCKED IT OFF
'A LETTER FROM YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCE THE HOUSEKEEPER AT THE GRANGE I
ANSWERED ANNOYED AT HER EXPOSING MY KIND DEED AND FEARFUL LEST IT
SHOULD BE IMAGINED A MISSIVE OF MY OWN
SHE WOULD GLADLY HAVE GATHERED
IT UP AT THIS INFORMATION BUT HARETON BEAT HER HE SEIZED AND PUT IT IN
HIS WAISTCOAT SAYING MR
HEATHCLIFF SHOULD LOOK AT IT FIRST
THEREAT
CATHERINE SILENTLY TURNED HER FACE FROM US AND VERY STEALTHILY DREW
OUT HER POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND APPLIED IT TO HER EYES AND HER COUSIN
AFTER STRUGGLING AWHILE TO KEEP DOWN HIS SOFTER FEELINGS PULLED OUT THE
LETTER AND FLUNG IT ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HER AS UNGRACIOUSLY AS HE COULD
CATHERINE CAUGHT AND PERUSED IT EAGERLY THEN SHE PUT A FEW QUESTIONS TO
ME CONCERNING THE INMATES RATIONAL AND IRRATIONAL OF HER FORMER HOME
AND GAZING TOWARDS THE HILLS MURMURED IN SOLILOQUY
'I SHOULD LIKE TO BE RIDING MINNY DOWN THERE I SHOULD LIKE TO BE
CLIMBING UP THERE OH I'M TIRED I'M STALLED HARETON AND SHE
LEANT HER PRETTY HEAD BACK AGAINST THE SILL WITH HALF A YAWN AND HALF A
SIGH AND LAPSED INTO AN ASPECT OF ABSTRACTED SADNESS NEITHER CARING NOR
KNOWING WHETHER WE REMARKED HER
'MRS
HEATHCLIFF I SAID AFTER SITTING SOME TIME MUTE 'YOU ARE NOT
AWARE THAT I AM AN ACQUAINTANCE OF YOURS SO INTIMATE THAT I THINK IT
STRANGE YOU WON'T COME AND SPEAK TO ME
MY HOUSEKEEPER NEVER WEARIES OF
TALKING ABOUT AND PRAISING YOU AND SHE'LL BE GREATLY DISAPPOINTED IF I
RETURN WITH NO NEWS OF OR FROM YOU EXCEPT THAT YOU RECEIVED HER LETTER
AND SAID NOTHING
SHE APPEARED TO WONDER AT THIS SPEECH AND ASKED
'DOES ELLEN LIKE YOU
'YES VERY WELL I REPLIED HESITATINGLY
'YOU MUST TELL HER SHE CONTINUED 'THAT I WOULD ANSWER HER LETTER BUT
I HAVE NO MATERIALS FOR WRITING NOT EVEN A BOOK FROM WHICH I MIGHT TEAR
A LEAF
'NO BOOKS I EXCLAIMED
'HOW DO YOU CONTRIVE TO LIVE HERE WITHOUT THEM
IF I MAY TAKE THE LIBERTY TO INQUIRE
THOUGH PROVIDED WITH A LARGE
LIBRARY I'M FREQUENTLY VERY DULL AT THE GRANGE TAKE MY BOOKS AWAY AND
I SHOULD BE DESPERATE
'I WAS ALWAYS READING WHEN I HAD THEM SAID CATHERINE 'AND MR
HEATHCLIFF NEVER READS SO HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD TO DESTROY MY BOOKS
I HAVE NOT HAD A GLIMPSE OF ONE FOR WEEKS
ONLY ONCE I SEARCHED THROUGH
JOSEPH'S STORE OF THEOLOGY TO HIS GREAT IRRITATION AND ONCE HARETON I
CAME UPON A SECRET STOCK IN YOUR ROOM SOME LATIN AND GREEK AND SOME
TALES AND POETRY ALL OLD FRIENDS
I BROUGHT THE LAST HERE AND YOU
GATHERED THEM AS A MAGPIE GATHERS SILVER SPOONS FOR THE MERE LOVE OF
STEALING THEY ARE OF NO USE TO YOU OR ELSE YOU CONCEALED THEM IN THE
BAD SPIRIT THAT AS YOU CANNOT ENJOY THEM NOBODY ELSE SHALL
PERHAPS
YOUR ENVY COUNSELLED MR
HEATHCLIFF TO ROB ME OF MY TREASURES BUT
I'VE MOST OF THEM WRITTEN ON MY BRAIN AND PRINTED IN MY HEART AND YOU
CANNOT DEPRIVE ME OF THOSE
EARNSHAW BLUSHED CRIMSON WHEN HIS COUSIN MADE THIS REVELATION OF HIS
PRIVATE LITERARY ACCUMULATIONS AND STAMMERED AN INDIGNANT DENIAL OF HER
ACCUSATIONS
'MR
HARETON IS DESIROUS OF INCREASING HIS AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE I SAID
COMING TO HIS RESCUE
'HE IS NOT ENVIOUS BUT EMULOUS OF YOUR
ATTAINMENTS
HE'LL BE A CLEVER SCHOLAR IN A FEW YEARS
'AND HE WANTS ME TO SINK INTO A DUNCE MEANTIME ANSWERED CATHERINE
'YES I HEAR HIM TRYING TO SPELL AND READ TO HIMSELF AND PRETTY BLUNDERS
HE MAKES I WISH YOU WOULD REPEAT CHEVY CHASE AS YOU DID YESTERDAY IT
WAS EXTREMELY FUNNY
I HEARD YOU AND I HEARD YOU TURNING OVER THE
DICTIONARY TO SEEK OUT THE HARD WORDS AND THEN CURSING BECAUSE YOU
COULDN'T READ THEIR EXPLANATIONS
THE YOUNG MAN EVIDENTLY THOUGHT IT TOO BAD THAT HE SHOULD BE LAUGHED AT
FOR HIS IGNORANCE AND THEN LAUGHED AT FOR TRYING TO REMOVE IT
I HAD A
SIMILAR NOTION AND REMEMBERING MRS
DEAN'S ANECDOTE OF HIS FIRST
ATTEMPT AT ENLIGHTENING THE DARKNESS IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN REARED I
OBSERVED 'BUT MRS
HEATHCLIFF WE HAVE EACH HAD A COMMENCEMENT AND
EACH STUMBLED AND TOTTERED ON THE THRESHOLD HAD OUR TEACHERS SCORNED
INSTEAD OF AIDING US WE SHOULD STUMBLE AND TOTTER YET
'OH SHE REPLIED 'I DON'T WISH TO LIMIT HIS ACQUIREMENTS STILL HE HAS
NO RIGHT TO APPROPRIATE WHAT IS MINE AND MAKE IT RIDICULOUS TO ME WITH
HIS VILE MISTAKES AND MISPRONUNCIATIONS THOSE BOOKS BOTH PROSE AND
VERSE ARE CONSECRATED TO ME BY OTHER ASSOCIATIONS AND I HATE TO HAVE
THEM DEBASED AND PROFANED IN HIS MOUTH BESIDES OF ALL HE HAS SELECTED
MY FAVOURITE PIECES THAT I LOVE THE MOST TO REPEAT AS IF OUT OF
DELIBERATE MALICE
HARETON'S CHEST HEAVED IN SILENCE A MINUTE HE LABOURED UNDER A SEVERE
SENSE OF MORTIFICATION AND WRATH WHICH IT WAS NO EASY TASK TO SUPPRESS
I ROSE AND FROM A GENTLEMANLY IDEA OF RELIEVING HIS EMBARRASSMENT TOOK
UP MY STATION IN THE DOORWAY SURVEYING THE EXTERNAL PROSPECT AS I STOOD
HE FOLLOWED MY EXAMPLE AND LEFT THE ROOM BUT PRESENTLY REAPPEARED
BEARING HALF A DOZEN VOLUMES IN HIS HANDS WHICH HE THREW INTO
CATHERINE'S LAP EXCLAIMING 'TAKE THEM I NEVER WANT TO HEAR OR READ
OR THINK OF THEM AGAIN
'I WON'T HAVE THEM NOW SHE ANSWERED
'I SHALL CONNECT THEM WITH YOU
AND HATE THEM
SHE OPENED ONE THAT HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN OFTEN TURNED OVER AND READ A
PORTION IN THE DRAWLING TONE OF A BEGINNER THEN LAUGHED AND THREW IT
FROM HER
'AND LISTEN SHE CONTINUED PROVOKINGLY COMMENCING A VERSE
OF AN OLD BALLAD IN THE SAME FASHION
BUT HIS SELF LOVE WOULD ENDURE NO FURTHER TORMENT I HEARD AND NOT
ALTOGETHER DISAPPROVINGLY A MANUAL CHECK GIVEN TO HER SAUCY TONGUE
THE
LITTLE WRETCH HAD DONE HER UTMOST TO HURT HER COUSIN'S SENSITIVE THOUGH
UNCULTIVATED FEELINGS AND A PHYSICAL ARGUMENT WAS THE ONLY MODE HE HAD
OF BALANCING THE ACCOUNT AND REPAYING ITS EFFECTS ON THE INFLICTOR
HE
AFTERWARDS GATHERED THE BOOKS AND HURLED THEM ON THE FIRE
I READ IN HIS
COUNTENANCE WHAT ANGUISH IT WAS TO OFFER THAT SACRIFICE TO SPLEEN
I
FANCIED THAT AS THEY CONSUMED HE RECALLED THE PLEASURE THEY HAD ALREADY
IMPARTED AND THE TRIUMPH AND EVER INCREASING PLEASURE HE HAD ANTICIPATED
FROM THEM AND I FANCIED I GUESSED THE INCITEMENT TO HIS SECRET STUDIES
ALSO
HE HAD BEEN CONTENT WITH DAILY LABOUR AND ROUGH ANIMAL ENJOYMENTS
TILL CATHERINE CROSSED HIS PATH
SHAME AT HER SCORN AND HOPE OF HER
APPROVAL WERE HIS FIRST PROMPTERS TO HIGHER PURSUITS AND INSTEAD OF
GUARDING HIM FROM ONE AND WINNING HIM TO THE OTHER HIS ENDEAVOURS TO
RAISE HIMSELF HAD PRODUCED JUST THE CONTRARY RESULT
'YES THAT'S ALL THE GOOD THAT SUCH A BRUTE AS YOU CAN GET FROM THEM
CRIED CATHERINE SUCKING HER DAMAGED LIP AND WATCHING THE CONFLAGRATION
WITH INDIGNANT EYES
'YOU'D BETTER HOLD YOUR TONGUE NOW HE ANSWERED FIERCELY
AND HIS AGITATION PRECLUDED FURTHER SPEECH HE ADVANCED HASTILY TO THE
ENTRANCE WHERE I MADE WAY FOR HIM TO PASS
BUT ERE HE HAD CROSSED THE
DOOR STONES MR
HEATHCLIFF COMING UP THE CAUSEWAY ENCOUNTERED HIM AND
LAYING HOLD OF HIS SHOULDER ASKED 'WHAT'S TO DO NOW MY LAD
'NAUGHT NAUGHT HE SAID AND BROKE AWAY TO ENJOY HIS GRIEF AND ANGER IN
SOLITUDE
HEATHCLIFF GAZED AFTER HIM AND SIGHED
'IT WILL BE ODD IF I THWART MYSELF HE MUTTERED UNCONSCIOUS THAT I WAS
BEHIND HIM
'BUT WHEN I LOOK FOR HIS FATHER IN HIS FACE I FIND HER
EVERY DAY MORE HOW THE DEVIL IS HE SO LIKE I CAN HARDLY BEAR TO SEE
HIM
HE BENT HIS EYES TO THE GROUND AND WALKED MOODILY IN
THERE WAS A
RESTLESS ANXIOUS EXPRESSION IN HIS COUNTENANCE
I HAD NEVER REMARKED
THERE BEFORE AND HE LOOKED SPARER IN PERSON
HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON
PERCEIVING HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED TO THE KITCHEN SO
THAT I REMAINED ALONE
'I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU OUT OF DOORS AGAIN MR
LOCKWOOD HE SAID IN REPLY
TO MY GREETING 'FROM SELFISH MOTIVES PARTLY I DON'T THINK I COULD
READILY SUPPLY YOUR LOSS IN THIS DESOLATION
I'VE WONDERED MORE THAN
ONCE WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE
'AN IDLE WHIM I FEAR SIR WAS MY ANSWER 'OR ELSE AN IDLE WHIM IS
GOING TO SPIRIT ME AWAY
I SHALL SET OUT FOR LONDON NEXT WEEK AND I
MUST GIVE YOU WARNING THAT I FEEL NO DISPOSITION TO RETAIN THRUSHCROSS
GRANGE BEYOND THE TWELVE MONTHS I AGREED TO RENT IT
I BELIEVE I SHALL
NOT LIVE THERE ANY MORE
'OH INDEED YOU'RE TIRED OF BEING BANISHED FROM THE WORLD ARE YOU HE
SAID
'BUT IF YOU BE COMING TO PLEAD OFF PAYING FOR A PLACE YOU WON'T
OCCUPY YOUR JOURNEY IS USELESS I NEVER RELENT IN EXACTING MY DUE FROM
ANY ONE
'I'M COMING TO PLEAD OFF NOTHING ABOUT IT I EXCLAIMED CONSIDERABLY
IRRITATED
'SHOULD YOU WISH IT I'LL SETTLE WITH YOU NOW AND I DREW MY
NOTE BOOK FROM MY POCKET
'NO NO HE REPLIED COOLLY 'YOU'LL LEAVE SUFFICIENT BEHIND TO COVER
YOUR DEBTS IF YOU FAIL TO RETURN I'M NOT IN SUCH A HURRY
SIT DOWN AND
TAKE YOUR DINNER WITH US A GUEST THAT IS SAFE FROM REPEATING HIS VISIT
CAN GENERALLY BE MADE WELCOME
CATHERINE BRING THE THINGS IN WHERE ARE
YOU
CATHERINE REAPPEARED BEARING A TRAY OF KNIVES AND FORKS
'YOU MAY GET YOUR DINNER WITH JOSEPH MUTTERED HEATHCLIFF ASIDE 'AND
REMAIN IN THE KITCHEN TILL HE IS GONE
SHE OBEYED HIS DIRECTIONS VERY PUNCTUALLY PERHAPS SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION
TO TRANSGRESS
LIVING AMONG CLOWNS AND MISANTHROPISTS SHE PROBABLY
CANNOT APPRECIATE A BETTER CLASS OF PEOPLE WHEN SHE MEETS THEM
WITH MR
HEATHCLIFF GRIM AND SATURNINE ON THE ONE HAND AND HARETON
ABSOLUTELY DUMB ON THE OTHER I MADE A SOMEWHAT CHEERLESS MEAL AND BADE
ADIEU EARLY
I WOULD HAVE DEPARTED BY THE BACK WAY TO GET A LAST
GLIMPSE OF CATHERINE AND ANNOY OLD JOSEPH BUT HARETON RECEIVED ORDERS TO
LEAD UP MY HORSE AND MY HOST HIMSELF ESCORTED ME TO THE DOOR SO I COULD
NOT FULFIL MY WISH
'HOW DREARY LIFE GETS OVER IN THAT HOUSE I REFLECTED WHILE RIDING DOWN
THE ROAD
'WHAT A REALISATION OF SOMETHING MORE ROMANTIC THAN A FAIRY
TALE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR MRS
LINTON HEATHCLIFF HAD SHE AND I STRUCK
UP AN ATTACHMENT AS HER GOOD NURSE DESIRED AND MIGRATED TOGETHER INTO
THE STIRRING ATMOSPHERE OF THE TOWN
CHAPTER XXXII
1802 THIS SEPTEMBER I WAS INVITED TO DEVASTATE THE MOORS OF A FRIEND IN
THE NORTH AND ON MY JOURNEY TO HIS ABODE I UNEXPECTEDLY CAME WITHIN
FIFTEEN MILES OF GIMMERTON
THE OSTLER AT A ROADSIDE PUBLIC HOUSE WAS
HOLDING A PAIL OF WATER TO REFRESH MY HORSES WHEN A CART OF VERY GREEN
OATS NEWLY REAPED PASSED BY AND HE REMARKED 'YON'S FROUGH GIMMERTON
NAH THEY'RE ALLAS THREE WICK' AFTER OTHER FOLK WI' THER HARVEST
'GIMMERTON I REPEATED MY RESIDENCE IN THAT LOCALITY HAD ALREADY GROWN
DIM AND DREAMY
'AH I KNOW
HOW FAR IS IT FROM THIS
'HAPPEN FOURTEEN MILE O'ER TH' HILLS AND A ROUGH ROAD HE ANSWERED
A SUDDEN IMPULSE SEIZED ME TO VISIT THRUSHCROSS GRANGE
IT WAS SCARCELY
NOON AND I CONCEIVED THAT I MIGHT AS WELL PASS THE NIGHT UNDER MY OWN
ROOF AS IN AN INN
BESIDES I COULD SPARE A DAY EASILY TO ARRANGE
MATTERS WITH MY LANDLORD AND THUS SAVE MYSELF THE TROUBLE OF INVADING
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AGAIN
HAVING RESTED AWHILE I DIRECTED MY SERVANT TO
INQUIRE THE WAY TO THE VILLAGE AND WITH GREAT FATIGUE TO OUR BEASTS WE
MANAGED THE DISTANCE IN SOME THREE HOURS
I LEFT HIM THERE AND PROCEEDED DOWN THE VALLEY ALONE
THE GREY CHURCH
LOOKED GREYER AND THE LONELY CHURCHYARD LONELIER
I DISTINGUISHED A
MOOR SHEEP CROPPING THE SHORT TURF ON THE GRAVES
IT WAS SWEET WARM
WEATHER TOO WARM FOR TRAVELLING BUT THE HEAT DID NOT HINDER ME FROM
ENJOYING THE DELIGHTFUL SCENERY ABOVE AND BELOW HAD I SEEN IT NEARER
AUGUST I'M SURE IT WOULD HAVE TEMPTED ME TO WASTE A MONTH AMONG ITS
SOLITUDES
IN WINTER NOTHING MORE DREARY IN SUMMER NOTHING MORE DIVINE
THAN THOSE GLENS SHUT IN BY HILLS AND THOSE BLUFF BOLD SWELLS OF HEATH
I REACHED THE GRANGE BEFORE SUNSET AND KNOCKED FOR ADMITTANCE BUT THE
FAMILY HAD RETREATED INTO THE BACK PREMISES I JUDGED BY ONE THIN BLUE
WREATH CURLING FROM THE KITCHEN CHIMNEY AND THEY DID NOT HEAR
I RODE
INTO THE COURT
UNDER THE PORCH A GIRL OF NINE OR TEN SAT KNITTING AND
AN OLD WOMAN RECLINED ON THE HOUSESTEPS SMOKING A MEDITATIVE PIPE
'IS MRS
DEAN WITHIN I DEMANDED OF THE DAME
'MISTRESS DEAN NAY SHE ANSWERED 'SHE DOESN'T BIDE HERE SHOO'S UP AT
TH' HEIGHTS
'ARE YOU THE HOUSEKEEPER THEN I CONTINUED
'EEA AW KEEP TH' HAUSE SHE REPLIED
'WELL I'M MR
LOCKWOOD THE MASTER
ARE THERE ANY ROOMS TO LODGE ME IN
I WONDER I WISH TO STAY ALL NIGHT
'T' MAISTER SHE CRIED IN ASTONISHMENT
'WHET WHOIVER KNEW YAH WUR
COMING YAH SUD HA' SEND WORD
THEY'S NOWT NORTHER DRY NOR MENSFUL
ABAHT T' PLACE NOWT THERE ISN'T
SHE THREW DOWN HER PIPE AND BUSTLED IN THE GIRL FOLLOWED AND I ENTERED
TOO SOON PERCEIVING THAT HER REPORT WAS TRUE AND MOREOVER THAT I HAD
ALMOST UPSET HER WITS BY MY UNWELCOME APPARITION I BADE HER BE COMPOSED
I WOULD GO OUT FOR A WALK AND MEANTIME SHE MUST TRY TO PREPARE A CORNER
OF A SITTING ROOM FOR ME TO SUP IN AND A BEDROOM TO SLEEP IN
NO
SWEEPING AND DUSTING ONLY GOOD FIRE AND DRY SHEETS WERE NECESSARY
SHE
SEEMED WILLING TO DO HER BEST THOUGH SHE THRUST THE HEARTH BRUSH INTO
THE GRATES IN MISTAKE FOR THE POKER AND MALAPPROPRIATED SEVERAL OTHER
ARTICLES OF HER CRAFT BUT I RETIRED CONFIDING IN HER ENERGY FOR A
RESTING PLACE AGAINST MY RETURN
WUTHERING HEIGHTS WAS THE GOAL OF MY
PROPOSED EXCURSION
AN AFTERTHOUGHT BROUGHT ME BACK WHEN I HAD QUITTED
THE COURT
'ALL WELL AT THE HEIGHTS I INQUIRED OF THE WOMAN
'EEA F'R OWT EE KNAW SHE ANSWERED SKURRYING AWAY WITH A PAN OF HOT
CINDERS
I WOULD HAVE ASKED WHY MRS
DEAN HAD DESERTED THE GRANGE BUT IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE TO DELAY HER AT SUCH A CRISIS SO I TURNED AWAY AND MADE MY
EXIT RAMBLING LEISURELY ALONG WITH THE GLOW OF A SINKING SUN BEHIND
AND THE MILD GLORY OF A RISING MOON IN FRONT ONE FADING AND THE OTHER
BRIGHTENING AS I QUITTED THE PARK AND CLIMBED THE STONY BY ROAD
BRANCHING OFF TO MR
HEATHCLIFF'S DWELLING
BEFORE I ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF
IT ALL THAT REMAINED OF DAY WAS A BEAMLESS AMBER LIGHT ALONG THE WEST
BUT I COULD SEE EVERY PEBBLE ON THE PATH AND EVERY BLADE OF GRASS BY
THAT SPLENDID MOON
I HAD NEITHER TO CLIMB THE GATE NOR TO KNOCK IT
YIELDED TO MY HAND
THAT IS AN IMPROVEMENT I THOUGHT
AND I NOTICED
ANOTHER BY THE AID OF MY NOSTRILS A FRAGRANCE OF STOCKS AND WALLFLOWERS
WAFTED ON THE AIR FROM AMONGST THE HOMELY FRUIT TREES
BOTH DOORS AND LATTICES WERE OPEN AND YET AS IS USUALLY THE CASE IN A
COAL DISTRICT A FINE RED FIRE ILLUMINED THE CHIMNEY THE COMFORT WHICH
THE EYE DERIVES FROM IT RENDERS THE EXTRA HEAT ENDURABLE
BUT THE HOUSE
OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS IS SO LARGE THAT THE INMATES HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE
FOR WITHDRAWING OUT OF ITS INFLUENCE AND ACCORDINGLY WHAT INMATES THERE
WERE HAD STATIONED THEMSELVES NOT FAR FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
I COULD
BOTH SEE THEM AND HEAR THEM TALK BEFORE I ENTERED AND LOOKED AND
LISTENED IN CONSEQUENCE BEING MOVED THERETO BY A MINGLED SENSE OF
CURIOSITY AND ENVY THAT GREW AS I LINGERED
'CON TRARY SAID A VOICE AS SWEET AS A SILVER BELL
'THAT FOR THE
THIRD TIME YOU DUNCE I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU AGAIN
RECOLLECT OR
I'LL PULL YOUR HAIR
'CONTRARY THEN ANSWERED ANOTHER IN DEEP BUT SOFTENED TONES
'AND NOW
KISS ME FOR MINDING SO WELL
'NO READ IT OVER FIRST CORRECTLY WITHOUT A SINGLE MISTAKE
THE MALE SPEAKER BEGAN TO READ HE WAS A YOUNG MAN RESPECTABLY DRESSED
AND SEATED AT A TABLE HAVING A BOOK BEFORE HIM
HIS HANDSOME FEATURES
GLOWED WITH PLEASURE AND HIS EYES KEPT IMPATIENTLY WANDERING FROM THE
PAGE TO A SMALL WHITE HAND OVER HIS SHOULDER WHICH RECALLED HIM BY A
SMART SLAP ON THE CHEEK WHENEVER ITS OWNER DETECTED SUCH SIGNS OF
INATTENTION
ITS OWNER STOOD BEHIND HER LIGHT SHINING RINGLETS
BLENDING AT INTERVALS WITH HIS BROWN LOOKS AS SHE BENT TO SUPERINTEND
HIS STUDIES AND HER FACE IT WAS LUCKY HE COULD NOT SEE HER FACE OR HE
WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SO STEADY
I COULD AND I BIT MY LIP IN SPITE AT
HAVING THROWN AWAY THE CHANCE I MIGHT HAVE HAD OF DOING SOMETHING BESIDES
STARING AT ITS SMITING BEAUTY
THE TASK WAS DONE NOT FREE FROM FURTHER BLUNDERS BUT THE PUPIL CLAIMED
A REWARD AND RECEIVED AT LEAST FIVE KISSES WHICH HOWEVER HE
GENEROUSLY RETURNED
THEN THEY CAME TO THE DOOR AND FROM THEIR
CONVERSATION I JUDGED THEY WERE ABOUT TO ISSUE OUT AND HAVE A WALK ON THE
MOORS
I SUPPOSED I SHOULD BE CONDEMNED IN HARETON EARNSHAW'S HEART IF
NOT BY HIS MOUTH TO THE LOWEST PIT IN THE INFERNAL REGIONS IF I SHOWED
MY UNFORTUNATE PERSON IN HIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THEN AND FEELING VERY MEAN
AND MALIGNANT I SKULKED ROUND TO SEEK REFUGE IN THE KITCHEN
THERE WAS
UNOBSTRUCTED ADMITTANCE ON THAT SIDE ALSO AND AT THE DOOR SAT MY OLD
FRIEND NELLY DEAN SEWING AND SINGING A SONG WHICH WAS OFTEN INTERRUPTED
FROM WITHIN BY HARSH WORDS OF SCORN AND INTOLERANCE UTTERED IN FAR FROM
MUSICAL ACCENTS
'I'D RAYTHER BY TH' HAULF HEV' 'EM SWEARING I' MY LUGS FRO'H MORN TO
NEEGHT NOR HEARKEN YE HAHSIVER SAID THE TENANT OF THE KITCHEN IN
ANSWER TO AN UNHEARD SPEECH OF NELLY'S
'IT'S A BLAZING SHAME THAT I
CANNOT OPPEN T' BLESSED BOOK BUT YAH SET UP THEM GLORIES TO SATTAN AND
ALL T' FLAYSOME WICKEDNESSES THAT IVER WERE BORN INTO TH' WARLD OH
YE'RE A RAIGHT NOWT AND SHOO'S ANOTHER AND THAT POOR LAD 'LL BE LOST
ATWEEN YE
POOR LAD HE ADDED WITH A GROAN 'HE'S WITCHED I'M SARTIN
ON'T
OH LORD JUDGE 'EM FOR THERE'S NORTHER LAW NOR JUSTICE AMONG WER
RULLERS
'NO OR WE SHOULD BE SITTING IN FLAMING FAGOTS I SUPPOSE RETORTED THE
SINGER
'BUT WISHT OLD MAN AND READ YOUR BIBLE LIKE A CHRISTIAN AND
NEVER MIND ME
THIS IS FAIRY ANNIE'S WEDDING A BONNY TUNE IT GOES TO
A DANCE
MRS
DEAN WAS ABOUT TO RECOMMENCE WHEN I ADVANCED AND RECOGNISING ME
DIRECTLY SHE JUMPED TO HER FEET CRYING 'WHY BLESS YOU MR
LOCKWOOD
HOW COULD YOU THINK OF RETURNING IN THIS WAY ALL'S SHUT UP AT
THRUSHCROSS GRANGE
YOU SHOULD HAVE GIVEN US NOTICE
'I'VE ARRANGED TO BE ACCOMMODATED THERE FOR AS LONG AS I SHALL STAY I
ANSWERED
'I DEPART AGAIN TO MORROW
AND HOW ARE YOU TRANSPLANTED HERE
MRS
DEAN TELL ME THAT
'ZILLAH LEFT AND MR
HEATHCLIFF WISHED ME TO COME SOON AFTER YOU WENT
TO LONDON AND STAY TILL YOU RETURNED
BUT STEP IN PRAY HAVE YOU
WALKED FROM GIMMERTON THIS EVENING
'FROM THE GRANGE I REPLIED 'AND WHILE THEY MAKE ME LODGING ROOM THERE
I WANT TO FINISH MY BUSINESS WITH YOUR MASTER BECAUSE I DON'T THINK OF
HAVING ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY IN A HURRY
'WHAT BUSINESS SIR SAID NELLY CONDUCTING ME INTO THE HOUSE
'HE'S
GONE OUT AT PRESENT AND WON'T RETURN SOON
'ABOUT THE RENT I ANSWERED
'OH THEN IT IS WITH MRS
HEATHCLIFF YOU MUST SETTLE SHE OBSERVED 'OR
RATHER WITH ME
SHE HAS NOT LEARNT TO MANAGE HER AFFAIRS YET AND I ACT
FOR HER THERE'S NOBODY ELSE
I LOOKED SURPRISED
'AH YOU HAVE NOT HEARD OF HEATHCLIFF'S DEATH I SEE SHE CONTINUED
'HEATHCLIFF DEAD I EXCLAIMED ASTONISHED
'HOW LONG AGO
'THREE MONTHS SINCE BUT SIT DOWN AND LET ME TAKE YOUR HAT AND I'LL
TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
STOP YOU HAVE HAD NOTHING TO EAT HAVE YOU
'I WANT NOTHING I HAVE ORDERED SUPPER AT HOME
YOU SIT DOWN TOO
I
NEVER DREAMT OF HIS DYING LET ME HEAR HOW IT CAME TO PASS
YOU SAY YOU
DON'T EXPECT THEM BACK FOR SOME TIME THE YOUNG PEOPLE
'NO I HAVE TO SCOLD THEM EVERY EVENING FOR THEIR LATE RAMBLES BUT THEY
DON'T CARE FOR ME
AT LEAST HAVE A DRINK OF OUR OLD ALE IT WILL DO YOU
GOOD YOU SEEM WEARY
SHE HASTENED TO FETCH IT BEFORE I COULD REFUSE AND I HEARD JOSEPH ASKING
WHETHER 'IT WARN'T A CRYING SCANDAL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWERS AT HER
TIME OF LIFE AND THEN TO GET THEM JOCKS OUT O' T' MAISTER'S CELLAR HE
FAIR SHAAMED TO 'BIDE STILL AND SEE IT
SHE DID NOT STAY TO RETALIATE BUT RE ENTERED IN A MINUTE BEARING A
REAMING SILVER PINT WHOSE CONTENTS I LAUDED WITH BECOMING EARNESTNESS
AND AFTERWARDS SHE FURNISHED ME WITH THE SEQUEL OF HEATHCLIFF'S HISTORY
HE HAD A 'QUEER' END AS SHE EXPRESSED IT
I WAS SUMMONED TO WUTHERING HEIGHTS WITHIN A FORTNIGHT OF YOUR LEAVING
US SHE SAID AND I OBEYED JOYFULLY FOR CATHERINE'S SAKE
MY FIRST
INTERVIEW WITH HER GRIEVED AND SHOCKED ME SHE HAD ALTERED SO MUCH SINCE
OUR SEPARATION
MR
HEATHCLIFF DID NOT EXPLAIN HIS REASONS FOR TAKING A
NEW MIND ABOUT MY COMING HERE HE ONLY TOLD ME HE WANTED ME AND HE WAS
TIRED OF SEEING CATHERINE I MUST MAKE THE LITTLE PARLOUR MY
SITTING ROOM AND KEEP HER WITH ME
IT WAS ENOUGH IF HE WERE OBLIGED TO
SEE HER ONCE OR TWICE A DAY
SHE SEEMED PLEASED AT THIS ARRANGEMENT AND
BY DEGREES I SMUGGLED OVER A GREAT NUMBER OF BOOKS AND OTHER ARTICLES
THAT HAD FORMED HER AMUSEMENT AT THE GRANGE AND FLATTERED MYSELF WE
SHOULD GET ON IN TOLERABLE COMFORT
THE DELUSION DID NOT LAST LONG
CATHERINE CONTENTED AT FIRST IN A BRIEF SPACE GREW IRRITABLE AND
RESTLESS
FOR ONE THING SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO MOVE OUT OF THE GARDEN AND
IT FRETTED HER SADLY TO BE CONFINED TO ITS NARROW BOUNDS AS SPRING DREW
ON FOR ANOTHER IN FOLLOWING THE HOUSE I WAS FORCED TO QUIT HER
FREQUENTLY AND SHE COMPLAINED OF LONELINESS SHE PREFERRED QUARRELLING
WITH JOSEPH IN THE KITCHEN TO SITTING AT PEACE IN HER SOLITUDE
I DID
NOT MIND THEIR SKIRMISHES BUT HARETON WAS OFTEN OBLIGED TO SEEK THE
KITCHEN ALSO WHEN THE MASTER WANTED TO HAVE THE HOUSE TO HIMSELF AND
THOUGH IN THE BEGINNING SHE EITHER LEFT IT AT HIS APPROACH OR QUIETLY
JOINED IN MY OCCUPATIONS AND SHUNNED REMARKING OR ADDRESSING HIM AND
THOUGH HE WAS ALWAYS AS SULLEN AND SILENT AS POSSIBLE AFTER A WHILE SHE
CHANGED HER BEHAVIOUR AND BECAME INCAPABLE OF LETTING HIM ALONE TALKING
AT HIM COMMENTING ON HIS STUPIDITY AND IDLENESS EXPRESSING HER WONDER
HOW HE COULD ENDURE THE LIFE HE LIVED HOW HE COULD SIT A WHOLE EVENING
STARING INTO THE FIRE AND DOZING
'HE'S JUST LIKE A DOG IS HE NOT ELLEN SHE ONCE OBSERVED 'OR A
CART HORSE HE DOES HIS WORK EATS HIS FOOD AND SLEEPS ETERNALLY WHAT
A BLANK DREARY MIND HE MUST HAVE DO YOU EVER DREAM HARETON AND IF
YOU DO WHAT IS IT ABOUT BUT YOU CAN'T SPEAK TO ME
THEN SHE LOOKED AT HIM BUT HE WOULD NEITHER OPEN HIS MOUTH NOR LOOK
AGAIN
'HE'S PERHAPS DREAMING NOW SHE CONTINUED
'HE TWITCHED HIS SHOULDER
AS JUNO TWITCHES HERS
ASK HIM ELLEN
'MR
HARETON WILL ASK THE MASTER TO SEND YOU UP STAIRS IF YOU DON'T
BEHAVE I SAID
HE HAD NOT ONLY TWITCHED HIS SHOULDER BUT CLENCHED HIS
FIST AS IF TEMPTED TO USE IT
'I KNOW WHY HARETON NEVER SPEAKS WHEN I AM IN THE KITCHEN SHE
EXCLAIMED ON ANOTHER OCCASION
'HE IS AFRAID I SHALL LAUGH AT HIM
ELLEN WHAT DO YOU THINK HE BEGAN TO TEACH HIMSELF TO READ ONCE AND
BECAUSE I LAUGHED HE BURNED HIS BOOKS AND DROPPED IT WAS HE NOT A
FOOL
'WERE NOT YOU NAUGHTY I SAID 'ANSWER ME THAT
'PERHAPS I WAS SHE WENT ON 'BUT I DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO BE SO SILLY
HARETON IF I GAVE YOU A BOOK WOULD YOU TAKE IT NOW I'LL TRY
SHE PLACED ONE SHE HAD BEEN PERUSING ON HIS HAND HE FLUNG IT OFF AND
MUTTERED IF SHE DID NOT GIVE OVER HE WOULD BREAK HER NECK
'WELL I SHALL PUT IT HERE SHE SAID 'IN THE TABLE DRAWER AND I'M
GOING TO BED
THEN SHE WHISPERED ME TO WATCH WHETHER HE TOUCHED IT AND DEPARTED
BUT
HE WOULD NOT COME NEAR IT AND SO I INFORMED HER IN THE MORNING TO HER
GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
I SAW SHE WAS SORRY FOR HIS PERSEVERING SULKINESS
AND INDOLENCE HER CONSCIENCE REPROVED HER FOR FRIGHTENING HIM OFF
IMPROVING HIMSELF SHE HAD DONE IT EFFECTUALLY
BUT HER INGENUITY WAS AT
WORK TO REMEDY THE INJURY WHILE I IRONED OR PURSUED OTHER SUCH
STATIONARY EMPLOYMENTS AS I COULD NOT WELL DO IN THE PARLOUR SHE WOULD
BRING SOME PLEASANT VOLUME AND READ IT ALOUD TO ME
WHEN HARETON WAS
THERE SHE GENERALLY PAUSED IN AN INTERESTING PART AND LEFT THE BOOK
LYING ABOUT THAT SHE DID REPEATEDLY BUT HE WAS AS OBSTINATE AS A MULE
AND INSTEAD OF SNATCHING AT HER BAIT IN WET WEATHER HE TOOK TO SMOKING
WITH JOSEPH AND THEY SAT LIKE AUTOMATONS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE FIRE
THE ELDER HAPPILY TOO DEAF TO UNDERSTAND HER WICKED NONSENSE AS HE WOULD
HAVE CALLED IT THE YOUNGER DOING HIS BEST TO SEEM TO DISREGARD IT
ON
FINE EVENINGS THE LATTER FOLLOWED HIS SHOOTING EXPEDITIONS AND CATHERINE
YAWNED AND SIGHED AND TEASED ME TO TALK TO HER AND RAN OFF INTO THE
COURT OR GARDEN THE MOMENT I BEGAN AND AS A LAST RESOURCE CRIED AND
SAID SHE WAS TIRED OF LIVING HER LIFE WAS USELESS
MR
HEATHCLIFF WHO GREW MORE AND MORE DISINCLINED TO SOCIETY HAD ALMOST
BANISHED EARNSHAW FROM HIS APARTMENT
OWING TO AN ACCIDENT AT THE
COMMENCEMENT OF MARCH HE BECAME FOR SOME DAYS A FIXTURE IN THE KITCHEN
HIS GUN BURST WHILE OUT ON THE HILLS BY HIMSELF A SPLINTER CUT HIS ARM
AND HE LOST A GOOD DEAL OF BLOOD BEFORE HE COULD REACH HOME
THE
CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT PERFORCE HE WAS CONDEMNED TO THE FIRESIDE AND
TRANQUILLITY TILL HE MADE IT UP AGAIN
IT SUITED CATHERINE TO HAVE HIM
THERE AT ANY RATE IT MADE HER HATE HER ROOM UP STAIRS MORE THAN EVER
AND SHE WOULD COMPEL ME TO FIND OUT BUSINESS BELOW THAT SHE MIGHT
ACCOMPANY ME
ON EASTER MONDAY JOSEPH WENT TO GIMMERTON FAIR WITH SOME CATTLE AND IN
THE AFTERNOON I WAS BUSY GETTING UP LINEN IN THE KITCHEN
EARNSHAW SAT
MOROSE AS USUAL AT THE CHIMNEY CORNER AND MY LITTLE MISTRESS WAS
BEGUILING AN IDLE HOUR WITH DRAWING PICTURES ON THE WINDOW PANES VARYING
HER AMUSEMENT BY SMOTHERED BURSTS OF SONGS AND WHISPERED EJACULATIONS
AND QUICK GLANCES OF ANNOYANCE AND IMPATIENCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HER
COUSIN WHO STEADFASTLY SMOKED AND LOOKED INTO THE GRATE
AT A NOTICE
THAT I COULD DO WITH HER NO LONGER INTERCEPTING MY LIGHT SHE REMOVED TO
THE HEARTHSTONE
I BESTOWED LITTLE ATTENTION ON HER PROCEEDINGS BUT
PRESENTLY I HEARD HER BEGIN 'I'VE FOUND OUT HARETON THAT I WANT THAT
I'M GLAD THAT I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO BE MY COUSIN NOW IF YOU HAD NOT
GROWN SO CROSS TO ME AND SO ROUGH
HARETON RETURNED NO ANSWER
'HARETON HARETON HARETON DO YOU HEAR SHE CONTINUED
'GET OFF WI' YE HE GROWLED WITH UNCOMPROMISING GRUFFNESS
'LET ME TAKE THAT PIPE SHE SAID CAUTIOUSLY ADVANCING HER HAND AND
ABSTRACTING IT FROM HIS MOUTH
BEFORE HE COULD ATTEMPT TO RECOVER IT IT WAS BROKEN AND BEHIND THE
FIRE
HE SWORE AT HER AND SEIZED ANOTHER
'STOP SHE CRIED 'YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME FIRST AND I CAN'T SPEAK WHILE
THOSE CLOUDS ARE FLOATING IN MY FACE
'WILL YOU GO TO THE DEVIL HE EXCLAIMED FEROCIOUSLY 'AND LET ME BE
'NO SHE PERSISTED 'I WON'T I CAN'T TELL WHAT TO DO TO MAKE YOU TALK
TO ME AND YOU ARE DETERMINED NOT TO UNDERSTAND
WHEN I CALL YOU STUPID
I DON'T MEAN ANYTHING I DON'T MEAN THAT I DESPISE YOU
COME YOU SHALL
TAKE NOTICE OF ME HARETON YOU ARE MY COUSIN AND YOU SHALL OWN ME
'I SHALL HAVE NAUGHT TO DO WI' YOU AND YOUR MUCKY PRIDE AND YOUR DAMNED
MOCKING TRICKS HE ANSWERED
'I'LL GO TO HELL BODY AND SOUL BEFORE I
LOOK SIDEWAYS AFTER YOU AGAIN
SIDE OUT O' T' GATE NOW THIS MINUTE
CATHERINE FROWNED AND RETREATED TO THE WINDOW SEAT CHEWING HER LIP AND
ENDEAVOURING BY HUMMING AN ECCENTRIC TUNE TO CONCEAL A GROWING TENDENCY
TO SOB
'YOU SHOULD BE FRIENDS WITH YOUR COUSIN MR
HARETON I INTERRUPTED
'SINCE SHE REPENTS OF HER SAUCINESS
IT WOULD DO YOU A GREAT DEAL OF
GOOD IT WOULD MAKE YOU ANOTHER MAN TO HAVE HER FOR A COMPANION
'A COMPANION HE CRIED 'WHEN SHE HATES ME AND DOES NOT THINK ME FIT TO
WIPE HER SHOON NAY IF IT MADE ME A KING I'D NOT BE SCORNED FOR
SEEKING HER GOOD WILL ANY MORE
'IT IS NOT I WHO HATE YOU IT IS YOU WHO HATE ME WEPT CATHY NO LONGER
DISGUISING HER TROUBLE
'YOU HATE ME AS MUCH AS MR
HEATHCLIFF DOES AND
MORE
'YOU'RE A DAMNED LIAR BEGAN EARNSHAW 'WHY HAVE I MADE HIM ANGRY BY
TAKING YOUR PART THEN A HUNDRED TIMES AND THAT WHEN YOU SNEERED AT AND
DESPISED ME AND GO ON PLAGUING ME AND I'LL STEP IN YONDER AND SAY YOU
WORRIED ME OUT OF THE KITCHEN
'I DIDN'T KNOW YOU TOOK MY PART SHE ANSWERED DRYING HER EYES 'AND I
WAS MISERABLE AND BITTER AT EVERYBODY BUT NOW I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU
TO FORGIVE ME WHAT CAN I DO BESIDES
SHE RETURNED TO THE HEARTH AND FRANKLY EXTENDED HER HAND
HE BLACKENED
AND SCOWLED LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND KEPT HIS FISTS RESOLUTELY CLENCHED
AND HIS GAZE FIXED ON THE GROUND
CATHERINE BY INSTINCT MUST HAVE
DIVINED IT WAS OBDURATE PERVERSITY AND NOT DISLIKE THAT PROMPTED THIS
DOGGED CONDUCT FOR AFTER REMAINING AN INSTANT UNDECIDED SHE STOOPED
AND IMPRESSED ON HIS CHEEK A GENTLE KISS
THE LITTLE ROGUE THOUGHT I HAD
NOT SEEN HER AND DRAWING BACK SHE TOOK HER FORMER STATION BY THE
WINDOW QUITE DEMURELY
I SHOOK MY HEAD REPROVINGLY AND THEN SHE
BLUSHED AND WHISPERED 'WELL WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE ELLEN HE
WOULDN'T SHAKE HANDS AND HE WOULDN'T LOOK I MUST SHOW HIM SOME WAY THAT
I LIKE HIM THAT I WANT TO BE FRIENDS
WHETHER THE KISS CONVINCED HARETON I CANNOT TELL HE WAS VERY CAREFUL
FOR SOME MINUTES THAT HIS FACE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AND WHEN HE DID RAISE
IT HE WAS SADLY PUZZLED WHERE TO TURN HIS EYES
CATHERINE EMPLOYED HERSELF IN WRAPPING A HANDSOME BOOK NEATLY IN WHITE
PAPER AND HAVING TIED IT WITH A BIT OF RIBBON AND ADDRESSED IT TO 'MR
HARETON EARNSHAW SHE DESIRED ME TO BE HER AMBASSADRESS AND CONVEY THE
PRESENT TO ITS DESTINED RECIPIENT
'AND TELL HIM IF HE'LL TAKE IT I'LL COME AND TEACH HIM TO READ IT
RIGHT SHE SAID 'AND IF HE REFUSE IT I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AND NEVER
TEASE HIM AGAIN
I CARRIED IT AND REPEATED THE MESSAGE ANXIOUSLY WATCHED BY MY EMPLOYER
HARETON WOULD NOT OPEN HIS FINGERS SO I LAID IT ON HIS KNEE
HE DID NOT
STRIKE IT OFF EITHER
I RETURNED TO MY WORK
CATHERINE LEANED HER HEAD
AND ARMS ON THE TABLE TILL SHE HEARD THE SLIGHT RUSTLE OF THE COVERING
BEING REMOVED THEN SHE STOLE AWAY AND QUIETLY SEATED HERSELF BESIDE HER
COUSIN
HE TREMBLED AND HIS FACE GLOWED ALL HIS RUDENESS AND ALL HIS
SURLY HARSHNESS HAD DESERTED HIM HE COULD NOT SUMMON COURAGE AT FIRST
TO UTTER A SYLLABLE IN REPLY TO HER QUESTIONING LOOK AND HER MURMURED
PETITION
'SAY YOU FORGIVE ME HARETON DO
YOU CAN MAKE ME SO HAPPY BY SPEAKING
THAT LITTLE WORD
HE MUTTERED SOMETHING INAUDIBLE
'AND YOU'LL BE MY FRIEND ADDED CATHERINE INTERROGATIVELY
'NAY YOU'LL BE ASHAMED OF ME EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE HE ANSWERED 'AND
THE MORE ASHAMED THE MORE YOU KNOW ME AND I CANNOT BIDE IT
'SO YOU WON'T BE MY FRIEND SHE SAID SMILING AS SWEET AS HONEY AND
CREEPING CLOSE UP
I OVERHEARD NO FURTHER DISTINGUISHABLE TALK BUT ON LOOKING ROUND AGAIN
I PERCEIVED TWO SUCH RADIANT COUNTENANCES BENT OVER THE PAGE OF THE
ACCEPTED BOOK THAT I DID NOT DOUBT THE TREATY HAD BEEN RATIFIED ON BOTH
SIDES AND THE ENEMIES WERE THENCEFORTH SWORN ALLIES
THE WORK THEY STUDIED WAS FULL OF COSTLY PICTURES AND THOSE AND THEIR
POSITION HAD CHARM ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM UNMOVED TILL JOSEPH CAME HOME
HE
POOR MAN WAS PERFECTLY AGHAST AT THE SPECTACLE OF CATHERINE SEATED ON
THE SAME BENCH WITH HARETON EARNSHAW LEANING HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER
AND CONFOUNDED AT HIS FAVOURITE'S ENDURANCE OF HER PROXIMITY IT AFFECTED
HIM TOO DEEPLY TO ALLOW AN OBSERVATION ON THE SUBJECT THAT NIGHT
HIS
EMOTION WAS ONLY REVEALED BY THE IMMENSE SIGHS HE DREW AS HE SOLEMNLY
SPREAD HIS LARGE BIBLE ON THE TABLE AND OVERLAID IT WITH DIRTY
BANK NOTES FROM HIS POCKET BOOK THE PRODUCE OF THE DAY'S TRANSACTIONS
AT LENGTH HE SUMMONED HARETON FROM HIS SEAT
'TAK' THESE IN TO T' MAISTER LAD HE SAID 'AND BIDE THERE
I'S GANG
UP TO MY OWN RAHM
THIS HOILE'S NEITHER MENSFUL NOR SEEMLY FOR US WE
MUN SIDE OUT AND SEEARCH ANOTHER
'COME CATHERINE I SAID 'WE MUST SIDE OUT TOO I'VE DONE MY IRONING
ARE YOU READY TO GO
'IT IS NOT EIGHT O'CLOCK SHE ANSWERED RISING UNWILLINGLY
'HARETON I'LL LEAVE THIS BOOK UPON THE CHIMNEY PIECE AND I'LL BRING
SOME MORE TO MORROW
'ONY BOOKS THAT YAH LEAVE I SHALL TAK' INTO TH' HAHSE SAID JOSEPH
'AND IT'LL BE MITCH IF YAH FIND 'EM AGEAN SOA YAH MAY PLASE YERSELN
CATHY THREATENED THAT HIS LIBRARY SHOULD PAY FOR HERS AND SMILING AS
SHE PASSED HARETON WENT SINGING UP STAIRS LIGHTER OF HEART I VENTURE
TO SAY THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN UNDER THAT ROOF BEFORE EXCEPT PERHAPS
DURING HER EARLIEST VISITS TO LINTON
THE INTIMACY THUS COMMENCED GREW RAPIDLY THOUGH IT ENCOUNTERED TEMPORARY
INTERRUPTIONS
EARNSHAW WAS NOT TO BE CIVILIZED WITH A WISH AND MY
YOUNG LADY WAS NO PHILOSOPHER AND NO PARAGON OF PATIENCE BUT BOTH THEIR
MINDS TENDING TO THE SAME POINT ONE LOVING AND DESIRING TO ESTEEM AND
THE OTHER LOVING AND DESIRING TO BE ESTEEMED THEY CONTRIVED IN THE END
TO REACH IT
YOU SEE MR
LOCKWOOD IT WAS EASY ENOUGH TO WIN MRS
HEATHCLIFF'S HEART
BUT NOW I'M GLAD YOU DID NOT TRY
THE CROWN OF ALL MY WISHES WILL BE
THE UNION OF THOSE TWO
I SHALL ENVY NO ONE ON THEIR WEDDING DAY THERE
WON'T BE A HAPPIER WOMAN THAN MYSELF IN ENGLAND
CHAPTER XXXIII
ON THE MORROW OF THAT MONDAY EARNSHAW BEING STILL UNABLE TO FOLLOW HIS
ORDINARY EMPLOYMENTS AND THEREFORE REMAINING ABOUT THE HOUSE I SPEEDILY
FOUND IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICABLE TO RETAIN MY CHARGE BESIDE ME AS
HERETOFORE
SHE GOT DOWNSTAIRS BEFORE ME AND OUT INTO THE GARDEN WHERE
SHE HAD SEEN HER COUSIN PERFORMING SOME EASY WORK AND WHEN I WENT TO BID
THEM COME TO BREAKFAST I SAW SHE HAD PERSUADED HIM TO CLEAR A LARGE
SPACE OF GROUND FROM CURRANT AND GOOSEBERRY BUSHES AND THEY WERE BUSY
PLANNING TOGETHER AN IMPORTATION OF PLANTS FROM THE GRANGE
I WAS TERRIFIED AT THE DEVASTATION WHICH HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN A BRIEF
HALF HOUR THE BLACK CURRANT TREES WERE THE APPLE OF JOSEPH'S EYE AND
SHE HAD JUST FIXED HER CHOICE OF A FLOWER BED IN THE MIDST OF THEM
'THERE THAT WILL BE ALL SHOWN TO THE MASTER I EXCLAIMED 'THE MINUTE
IT IS DISCOVERED
AND WHAT EXCUSE HAVE YOU TO OFFER FOR TAKING SUCH
LIBERTIES WITH THE GARDEN WE SHALL HAVE A FINE EXPLOSION ON THE HEAD OF
IT SEE IF WE DON'T MR
HARETON I WONDER YOU SHOULD HAVE NO MORE WIT
THAN TO GO AND MAKE THAT MESS AT HER BIDDING
'I'D FORGOTTEN THEY WERE JOSEPH'S ANSWERED EARNSHAW RATHER PUZZLED
'BUT I'LL TELL HIM I DID IT
WE ALWAYS ATE OUR MEALS WITH MR
HEATHCLIFF
I HELD THE MISTRESS'S POST
IN MAKING TEA AND CARVING SO I WAS INDISPENSABLE AT TABLE
CATHERINE
USUALLY SAT BY ME BUT TO DAY SHE STOLE NEARER TO HARETON AND I
PRESENTLY SAW SHE WOULD HAVE NO MORE DISCRETION IN HER FRIENDSHIP THAN
SHE HAD IN HER HOSTILITY
'NOW MIND YOU DON'T TALK WITH AND NOTICE YOUR COUSIN TOO MUCH WERE MY
WHISPERED INSTRUCTIONS AS WE ENTERED THE ROOM
'IT WILL CERTAINLY ANNOY
MR
HEATHCLIFF AND HE'LL BE MAD AT YOU BOTH
'I'M NOT GOING TO SHE ANSWERED
THE MINUTE AFTER SHE HAD SIDLED TO HIM AND WAS STICKING PRIMROSES IN
HIS PLATE OF PORRIDGE
HE DARED NOT SPEAK TO HER THERE HE DARED HARDLY LOOK AND YET SHE WENT
ON TEASING TILL HE WAS TWICE ON THE POINT OF BEING PROVOKED TO LAUGH
I
FROWNED AND THEN SHE GLANCED TOWARDS THE MASTER WHOSE MIND WAS OCCUPIED
ON OTHER SUBJECTS THAN HIS COMPANY AS HIS COUNTENANCE EVINCED AND SHE
GREW SERIOUS FOR AN INSTANT SCRUTINIZING HIM WITH DEEP GRAVITY
AFTERWARDS SHE TURNED AND RECOMMENCED HER NONSENSE AT LAST HARETON
UTTERED A SMOTHERED LAUGH
MR
HEATHCLIFF STARTED HIS EYE RAPIDLY
SURVEYED OUR FACES CATHERINE MET IT WITH HER ACCUSTOMED LOOK OF
NERVOUSNESS AND YET DEFIANCE WHICH HE ABHORRED
'IT IS WELL YOU ARE OUT OF MY REACH HE EXCLAIMED
'WHAT FIEND
POSSESSES YOU TO STARE BACK AT ME CONTINUALLY WITH THOSE INFERNAL EYES
DOWN WITH THEM AND DON'T REMIND ME OF YOUR EXISTENCE AGAIN
I THOUGHT I
HAD CURED YOU OF LAUGHING
'IT WAS ME MUTTERED HARETON
'WHAT DO YOU SAY DEMANDED THE MASTER
HARETON LOOKED AT HIS PLATE AND DID NOT REPEAT THE CONFESSION
MR
HEATHCLIFF LOOKED AT HIM A BIT AND THEN SILENTLY RESUMED HIS BREAKFAST
AND HIS INTERRUPTED MUSING
WE HAD NEARLY FINISHED AND THE TWO YOUNG
PEOPLE PRUDENTLY SHIFTED WIDER ASUNDER SO I ANTICIPATED NO FURTHER
DISTURBANCE DURING THAT SITTING WHEN JOSEPH APPEARED AT THE DOOR
REVEALING BY HIS QUIVERING LIP AND FURIOUS EYES THAT THE OUTRAGE
COMMITTED ON HIS PRECIOUS SHRUBS WAS DETECTED
HE MUST HAVE SEEN CATHY
AND HER COUSIN ABOUT THE SPOT BEFORE HE EXAMINED IT FOR WHILE HIS JAWS
WORKED LIKE THOSE OF A COW CHEWING ITS CUD AND RENDERED HIS SPEECH
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN
'I MUN HEV' MY WAGE AND I MUN GOA I HED AIMED TO DEE WHEARE I'D
SARVED FUR SIXTY YEAR AND I THOWT I'D LUG MY BOOKS UP INTO T' GARRET
AND ALL MY BITS O' STUFF AND THEY SUD HEV' T' KITCHEN TO THEIRSELN FOR

BARTHENS

'NOW NOW IDIOT INTERRUPTED HEATHCLIFF 'CUT IT SHORT WHAT'S YOUR
GRIEVANCE I'LL INTERFERE IN NO QUARRELS BETWEEN YOU AND NELLY
SHE MAY
THRUST YOU INTO THE COAL HOLE FOR ANYTHING I CARE
'IT'S NOAN NELLY ANSWERED JOSEPH
'I SUDN'T SHIFT FOR NELLY NASTY ILL
NOWT AS SHOO IS
THANK GOD SHOO CANNOT STALE T' SOWL O' NOB'DY SHOO
WER NIVER SOA HANDSOME BUT WHAT A BODY MUD LOOK AT HER 'BOUT WINKING
IT'S YON FLAYSOME GRACELESS QUEAN THAT'S WITCHED OUR LAD WI' HER BOLD
EEN AND HER FORRARD WAYS TILL NAY IT FAIR BRUSTS MY HEART HE'S
FORGOTTEN ALL I'VE DONE FOR HIM AND MADE ON HIM AND GOAN AND RIVEN UP A
WHOLE ROW O' T' GRANDEST CURRANT TREES I' T' GARDEN AND HERE HE
LAMENTED OUTRIGHT UNMANNED BY A SENSE OF HIS BITTER INJURIES AND
EARNSHAW'S INGRATITUDE AND DANGEROUS CONDITION
'IS THE FOOL DRUNK ASKED MR
HEATHCLIFF
'HARETON IS IT YOU HE'S
FINDING FAULT WITH
'I'VE PULLED UP TWO OR THREE BUSHES REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN 'BUT I'M
GOING TO SET 'EM AGAIN
'AND WHY HAVE YOU PULLED THEM UP SAID THE MASTER
CATHERINE WISELY PUT IN HER TONGUE
'WE WANTED TO PLANT SOME FLOWERS THERE SHE CRIED
'I'M THE ONLY PERSON
TO BLAME FOR I WISHED HIM TO DO IT
'AND WHO THE DEVIL GAVE YOU LEAVE TO TOUCH A STICK ABOUT THE PLACE
DEMANDED HER FATHER IN LAW MUCH SURPRISED
'AND WHO ORDERED YOU TO
OBEY HER HE ADDED TURNING TO HARETON
THE LATTER WAS SPEECHLESS HIS COUSIN REPLIED 'YOU SHOULDN'T GRUDGE A
FEW YARDS OF EARTH FOR ME TO ORNAMENT WHEN YOU HAVE TAKEN ALL MY LAND
'YOUR LAND INSOLENT SLUT YOU NEVER HAD ANY SAID HEATHCLIFF
'AND MY MONEY SHE CONTINUED RETURNING HIS ANGRY GLARE AND MEANTIME
BITING A PIECE OF CRUST THE REMNANT OF HER BREAKFAST
'SILENCE HE EXCLAIMED
'GET DONE AND BEGONE
'AND HARETON'S LAND AND HIS MONEY PURSUED THE RECKLESS THING
'HARETON
AND I ARE FRIENDS NOW AND I SHALL TELL HIM ALL ABOUT YOU
THE MASTER SEEMED CONFOUNDED A MOMENT HE GREW PALE AND ROSE UP EYEING
HER ALL THE WHILE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF MORTAL HATE
'IF YOU STRIKE ME HARETON WILL STRIKE YOU SHE SAID 'SO YOU MAY AS
WELL SIT DOWN
'IF HARETON DOES NOT TURN YOU OUT OF THE ROOM I'LL STRIKE HIM TO HELL
THUNDERED HEATHCLIFF
'DAMNABLE WITCH DARE YOU PRETEND TO ROUSE HIM
AGAINST ME OFF WITH HER DO YOU HEAR FLING HER INTO THE KITCHEN
I'LL KILL HER ELLEN DEAN IF YOU LET HER COME INTO MY SIGHT AGAIN
HARETON TRIED UNDER HIS BREATH TO PERSUADE HER TO GO
'DRAG HER AWAY HE CRIED SAVAGELY
'ARE YOU STAYING TO TALK AND HE
APPROACHED TO EXECUTE HIS OWN COMMAND
'HE'LL NOT OBEY YOU WICKED MAN ANY MORE SAID CATHERINE 'AND HE'LL
SOON DETEST YOU AS MUCH AS I DO
'WISHT WISHT MUTTERED THE YOUNG MAN REPROACHFULLY 'I WILL NOT HEAR
YOU SPEAK SO TO HIM
HAVE DONE
'BUT YOU WON'T LET HIM STRIKE ME SHE CRIED
'COME THEN HE WHISPERED EARNESTLY
IT WAS TOO LATE HEATHCLIFF HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF HER
'NOW YOU GO HE SAID TO EARNSHAW
'ACCURSED WITCH THIS TIME SHE HAS
PROVOKED ME WHEN I COULD NOT BEAR IT AND I'LL MAKE HER REPENT IT FOR
EVER
HE HAD HIS HAND IN HER HAIR HARETON ATTEMPTED TO RELEASE HER LOCKS
ENTREATING HIM NOT TO HURT HER THAT ONCE
HEATHCLIFF'S BLACK EYES
FLASHED HE SEEMED READY TO TEAR CATHERINE IN PIECES AND I WAS JUST
WORKED UP TO RISK COMING TO THE RESCUE WHEN OF A SUDDEN HIS FINGERS
RELAXED HE SHIFTED HIS GRASP FROM HER HEAD TO HER ARM AND GAZED
INTENTLY IN HER FACE
THEN HE DREW HIS HAND OVER HIS EYES STOOD A
MOMENT TO COLLECT HIMSELF APPARENTLY AND TURNING ANEW TO CATHERINE
SAID WITH ASSUMED CALMNESS 'YOU MUST LEARN TO AVOID PUTTING ME IN A
PASSION OR I SHALL REALLY MURDER YOU SOME TIME GO WITH MRS
DEAN AND
KEEP WITH HER AND CONFINE YOUR INSOLENCE TO HER EARS
AS TO HARETON
EARNSHAW IF I SEE HIM LISTEN TO YOU I'LL SEND HIM SEEKING HIS BREAD
WHERE HE CAN GET IT YOUR LOVE WILL MAKE HIM AN OUTCAST AND A BEGGAR
NELLY TAKE HER AND LEAVE ME ALL OF YOU LEAVE ME
I LED MY YOUNG LADY OUT SHE WAS TOO GLAD OF HER ESCAPE TO RESIST THE
OTHER FOLLOWED AND MR
HEATHCLIFF HAD THE ROOM TO HIMSELF TILL DINNER
I
HAD COUNSELLED CATHERINE TO DINE UP STAIRS BUT AS SOON AS HE PERCEIVED
HER VACANT SEAT HE SENT ME TO CALL HER
HE SPOKE TO NONE OF US ATE
VERY LITTLE AND WENT OUT DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS INTIMATING THAT HE SHOULD
NOT RETURN BEFORE EVENING
THE TWO NEW FRIENDS ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN THE HOUSE DURING HIS
ABSENCE WHERE I HEARD HARETON STERNLY CHECK HIS COUSIN ON HER OFFERING
A REVELATION OF HER FATHER IN LAW'S CONDUCT TO HIS FATHER
HE SAID HE
WOULDN'T SUFFER A WORD TO BE UTTERED IN HIS DISPARAGEMENT IF HE WERE THE
DEVIL IT DIDN'T SIGNIFY HE WOULD STAND BY HIM AND HE'D RATHER SHE
WOULD ABUSE HIMSELF AS SHE USED TO THAN BEGIN ON MR
HEATHCLIFF
CATHERINE WAS WAXING CROSS AT THIS BUT HE FOUND MEANS TO MAKE HER HOLD
HER TONGUE BY ASKING HOW SHE WOULD LIKE HIM TO SPEAK ILL OF HER
FATHER THEN SHE COMPREHENDED THAT EARNSHAW TOOK THE MASTER'S REPUTATION
HOME TO HIMSELF AND WAS ATTACHED BY TIES STRONGER THAN REASON COULD
BREAK CHAINS FORGED BY HABIT WHICH IT WOULD BE CRUEL TO ATTEMPT TO
LOOSEN
SHE SHOWED A GOOD HEART THENCEFORTH IN AVOIDING BOTH
COMPLAINTS AND EXPRESSIONS OF ANTIPATHY CONCERNING HEATHCLIFF AND
CONFESSED TO ME HER SORROW THAT SHE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO RAISE A BAD SPIRIT
BETWEEN HIM AND HARETON INDEED I DON'T BELIEVE SHE HAS EVER BREATHED A
SYLLABLE IN THE LATTER'S HEARING AGAINST HER OPPRESSOR SINCE
WHEN THIS SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT WAS OVER THEY WERE FRIENDS AGAIN AND AS
BUSY AS POSSIBLE IN THEIR SEVERAL OCCUPATIONS OF PUPIL AND TEACHER
I
CAME IN TO SIT WITH THEM AFTER I HAD DONE MY WORK AND I FELT SO SOOTHED
AND COMFORTED TO WATCH THEM THAT I DID NOT NOTICE HOW TIME GOT ON
YOU
KNOW THEY BOTH APPEARED IN A MEASURE MY CHILDREN I HAD LONG BEEN PROUD
OF ONE AND NOW I WAS SURE THE OTHER WOULD BE A SOURCE OF EQUAL
SATISFACTION
HIS HONEST WARM AND INTELLIGENT NATURE SHOOK OFF RAPIDLY
THE CLOUDS OF IGNORANCE AND DEGRADATION IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN BRED AND
CATHERINE'S SINCERE COMMENDATIONS ACTED AS A SPUR TO HIS INDUSTRY
HIS
BRIGHTENING MIND BRIGHTENED HIS FEATURES AND ADDED SPIRIT AND NOBILITY
TO THEIR ASPECT I COULD HARDLY FANCY IT THE SAME INDIVIDUAL I HAD BEHELD
ON THE DAY I DISCOVERED MY LITTLE LADY AT WUTHERING HEIGHTS AFTER HER
EXPEDITION TO THE CRAGS
WHILE I ADMIRED AND THEY LABOURED DUSK DREW
ON AND WITH IT RETURNED THE MASTER
HE CAME UPON US QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY
ENTERING BY THE FRONT WAY AND HAD A FULL VIEW OF THE WHOLE THREE ERE WE
COULD RAISE OUR HEADS TO GLANCE AT HIM
WELL I REFLECTED THERE WAS
NEVER A PLEASANTER OR MORE HARMLESS SIGHT AND IT WILL BE A BURNING
SHAME TO SCOLD THEM
THE RED FIRE LIGHT GLOWED ON THEIR TWO BONNY HEADS
AND REVEALED THEIR FACES ANIMATED WITH THE EAGER INTEREST OF CHILDREN
FOR THOUGH HE WAS TWENTY THREE AND SHE EIGHTEEN EACH HAD SO MUCH OF
NOVELTY TO FEEL AND LEARN THAT NEITHER EXPERIENCED NOR EVINCED THE
SENTIMENTS OF SOBER DISENCHANTED MATURITY
THEY LIFTED THEIR EYES TOGETHER TO ENCOUNTER MR
HEATHCLIFF PERHAPS YOU
HAVE NEVER REMARKED THAT THEIR EYES ARE PRECISELY SIMILAR AND THEY ARE
THOSE OF CATHERINE EARNSHAW
THE PRESENT CATHERINE HAS NO OTHER LIKENESS
TO HER EXCEPT A BREADTH OF FOREHEAD AND A CERTAIN ARCH OF THE NOSTRIL
THAT MAKES HER APPEAR RATHER HAUGHTY WHETHER SHE WILL OR NOT
WITH
HARETON THE RESEMBLANCE IS CARRIED FARTHER IT IS SINGULAR AT ALL TIMES
THEN IT WAS PARTICULARLY STRIKING BECAUSE HIS SENSES WERE ALERT AND
HIS MENTAL FACULTIES WAKENED TO UNWONTED ACTIVITY
I SUPPOSE THIS
RESEMBLANCE DISARMED MR
HEATHCLIFF HE WALKED TO THE HEARTH IN EVIDENT
AGITATION BUT IT QUICKLY SUBSIDED AS HE LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MAN OR I
SHOULD SAY ALTERED ITS CHARACTER FOR IT WAS THERE YET
HE TOOK THE
BOOK FROM HIS HAND AND GLANCED AT THE OPEN PAGE THEN RETURNED IT
WITHOUT ANY OBSERVATION MERELY SIGNING CATHERINE AWAY HER COMPANION
LINGERED VERY LITTLE BEHIND HER AND I WAS ABOUT TO DEPART ALSO BUT HE
BID ME SIT STILL
'IT IS A POOR CONCLUSION IS IT NOT HE OBSERVED HAVING BROODED AWHILE
ON THE SCENE HE HAD JUST WITNESSED 'AN ABSURD TERMINATION TO MY VIOLENT
EXERTIONS I GET LEVERS AND MATTOCKS TO DEMOLISH THE TWO HOUSES AND
TRAIN MYSELF TO BE CAPABLE OF WORKING LIKE HERCULES AND WHEN EVERYTHING
IS READY AND IN MY POWER I FIND THE WILL TO LIFT A SLATE OFF EITHER ROOF
HAS VANISHED MY OLD ENEMIES HAVE NOT BEATEN ME NOW WOULD BE THE
PRECISE TIME TO REVENGE MYSELF ON THEIR REPRESENTATIVES I COULD DO IT
AND NONE COULD HINDER ME
BUT WHERE IS THE USE I DON'T CARE FOR
STRIKING I CAN'T TAKE THE TROUBLE TO RAISE MY HAND THAT SOUNDS AS IF I
HAD BEEN LABOURING THE WHOLE TIME ONLY TO EXHIBIT A FINE TRAIT OF
MAGNANIMITY
IT IS FAR FROM BEING THE CASE I HAVE LOST THE FACULTY OF
ENJOYING THEIR DESTRUCTION AND I AM TOO IDLE TO DESTROY FOR NOTHING
'NELLY THERE IS A STRANGE CHANGE APPROACHING I'M IN ITS SHADOW AT
PRESENT
I TAKE SO LITTLE INTEREST IN MY DAILY LIFE THAT I HARDLY
REMEMBER TO EAT AND DRINK
THOSE TWO WHO HAVE LEFT THE ROOM ARE THE ONLY
OBJECTS WHICH RETAIN A DISTINCT MATERIAL APPEARANCE TO ME AND THAT
APPEARANCE CAUSES ME PAIN AMOUNTING TO AGONY
ABOUT HER I WON'T
SPEAK AND I DON'T DESIRE TO THINK BUT I EARNESTLY WISH SHE WERE
INVISIBLE HER PRESENCE INVOKES ONLY MADDENING SENSATIONS
HE MOVES ME
DIFFERENTLY AND YET IF I COULD DO IT WITHOUT SEEMING INSANE I'D NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN YOU'LL PERHAPS THINK ME RATHER INCLINED TO BECOME SO HE
ADDED MAKING AN EFFORT TO SMILE 'IF I TRY TO DESCRIBE THE THOUSAND
FORMS OF PAST ASSOCIATIONS AND IDEAS HE AWAKENS OR EMBODIES
BUT YOU'LL
NOT TALK OF WHAT I TELL YOU AND MY MIND IS SO ETERNALLY SECLUDED IN
ITSELF IT IS TEMPTING AT LAST TO TURN IT OUT TO ANOTHER
'FIVE MINUTES AGO HARETON SEEMED A PERSONIFICATION OF MY YOUTH NOT A
HUMAN BEING I FELT TO HIM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE ACCOSTED HIM RATIONALLY
IN THE FIRST PLACE HIS
STARTLING LIKENESS TO CATHERINE CONNECTED HIM FEARFULLY WITH HER
THAT
HOWEVER WHICH YOU MAY SUPPOSE THE MOST POTENT TO ARREST MY IMAGINATION
IS ACTUALLY THE LEAST FOR WHAT IS NOT CONNECTED WITH HER TO ME AND WHAT
DOES NOT RECALL HER I CANNOT LOOK DOWN TO THIS FLOOR BUT HER FEATURES
ARE SHAPED IN THE FLAGS IN EVERY CLOUD IN EVERY TREE FILLING THE AIR
AT NIGHT AND CAUGHT BY GLIMPSES IN EVERY OBJECT BY DAY I AM SURROUNDED
WITH HER IMAGE THE MOST ORDINARY FACES OF MEN AND WOMEN MY OWN
FEATURES MOCK ME WITH A RESEMBLANCE
THE ENTIRE WORLD IS A DREADFUL
COLLECTION OF MEMORANDA THAT SHE DID EXIST AND THAT I HAVE LOST HER
WELL HARETON'S ASPECT WAS THE GHOST OF MY IMMORTAL LOVE OF MY WILD
ENDEAVOURS TO HOLD MY RIGHT MY DEGRADATION MY PRIDE MY HAPPINESS AND
MY ANGUISH
'BUT IT IS FRENZY TO REPEAT THESE THOUGHTS TO YOU ONLY IT WILL LET YOU
KNOW WHY WITH A RELUCTANCE TO BE ALWAYS ALONE HIS SOCIETY IS NO
BENEFIT RATHER AN AGGRAVATION OF THE CONSTANT TORMENT I SUFFER AND IT
PARTLY CONTRIBUTES TO RENDER ME REGARDLESS HOW HE AND HIS COUSIN GO ON
TOGETHER
I CAN GIVE THEM NO ATTENTION ANY MORE
'BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY A CHANGE MR
HEATHCLIFF I SAID ALARMED AT
HIS MANNER THOUGH HE WAS NEITHER IN DANGER OF LOSING HIS SENSES NOR
DYING ACCORDING TO MY JUDGMENT HE WAS QUITE STRONG AND HEALTHY AND AS
TO HIS REASON FROM CHILDHOOD HE HAD A DELIGHT IN DWELLING ON DARK
THINGS AND ENTERTAINING ODD FANCIES
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD A MONOMANIA ON
THE SUBJECT OF HIS DEPARTED IDOL BUT ON EVERY OTHER POINT HIS WITS WERE
AS SOUND AS MINE
'I SHALL NOT KNOW THAT TILL IT COMES HE SAID 'I'M ONLY HALF CONSCIOUS
OF IT NOW
'YOU HAVE NO FEELING OF ILLNESS HAVE YOU I ASKED
'NO NELLY I HAVE NOT HE ANSWERED
'THEN YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF DEATH I PURSUED
'AFRAID NO HE REPLIED
'I HAVE NEITHER A FEAR NOR A PRESENTIMENT
NOR A HOPE OF DEATH
WHY SHOULD I WITH MY HARD CONSTITUTION AND
TEMPERATE MODE OF LIVING AND UNPERILOUS OCCUPATIONS I OUGHT TO AND
PROBABLY SHALL REMAIN ABOVE GROUND TILL THERE IS SCARCELY A BLACK HAIR
ON MY HEAD
AND YET I CANNOT CONTINUE IN THIS CONDITION I HAVE TO
REMIND MYSELF TO BREATHE ALMOST TO REMIND MY HEART TO BEAT AND IT IS
LIKE BENDING BACK A STIFF SPRING IT IS BY COMPULSION THAT I DO THE
SLIGHTEST ACT NOT PROMPTED BY ONE THOUGHT AND BY COMPULSION THAT I
NOTICE ANYTHING ALIVE OR DEAD WHICH IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ONE UNIVERSAL
IDEA
I HAVE A SINGLE WISH AND MY WHOLE BEING AND FACULTIES ARE
YEARNING TO ATTAIN IT
THEY HAVE YEARNED TOWARDS IT SO LONG AND SO
UNWAVERINGLY THAT I'M CONVINCED IT WILL BE REACHED AND SOON BECAUSE IT
HAS DEVOURED MY EXISTENCE I AM SWALLOWED UP IN THE ANTICIPATION OF ITS
FULFILMENT
MY CONFESSIONS HAVE NOT RELIEVED ME BUT THEY MAY ACCOUNT
FOR SOME OTHERWISE UNACCOUNTABLE PHASES OF HUMOUR WHICH I SHOW
O GOD
IT IS A LONG FIGHT I WISH IT WERE OVER
HE BEGAN TO PACE THE ROOM MUTTERING TERRIBLE THINGS TO HIMSELF TILL I
WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE AS HE SAID JOSEPH DID THAT CONSCIENCE HAD
TURNED HIS HEART TO AN EARTHLY HELL
I WONDERED GREATLY HOW IT WOULD
END
THOUGH HE SELDOM BEFORE HAD REVEALED THIS STATE OF MIND EVEN BY
LOOKS IT WAS HIS HABITUAL MOOD I HAD NO DOUBT HE ASSERTED IT HIMSELF
BUT NOT A SOUL FROM HIS GENERAL BEARING WOULD HAVE CONJECTURED THE
FACT
YOU DID NOT WHEN YOU SAW HIM MR
LOCKWOOD AND AT THE PERIOD OF
WHICH I SPEAK HE WAS JUST THE SAME AS THEN ONLY FONDER OF CONTINUED
SOLITUDE AND PERHAPS STILL MORE LACONIC IN COMPANY
CHAPTER XXXIV
FOR SOME DAYS AFTER THAT EVENING MR
HEATHCLIFF SHUNNED MEETING US AT
MEALS YET HE WOULD NOT CONSENT FORMALLY TO EXCLUDE HARETON AND CATHY
HE
HAD AN AVERSION TO YIELDING SO COMPLETELY TO HIS FEELINGS CHOOSING
RATHER TO ABSENT HIMSELF AND EATING ONCE IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS SEEMED
SUFFICIENT SUSTENANCE FOR HIM
ONE NIGHT AFTER THE FAMILY WERE IN BED I HEARD HIM GO DOWNSTAIRS AND
OUT AT THE FRONT DOOR
I DID NOT HEAR HIM RE ENTER AND IN THE MORNING I
FOUND HE WAS STILL AWAY
WE WERE IN APRIL THEN THE WEATHER WAS SWEET
AND WARM THE GRASS AS GREEN AS SHOWERS AND SUN COULD MAKE IT AND THE
TWO DWARF APPLE TREES NEAR THE SOUTHERN WALL IN FULL BLOOM
AFTER
BREAKFAST CATHERINE INSISTED ON MY BRINGING A CHAIR AND SITTING WITH MY
WORK UNDER THE FIR TREES AT THE END OF THE HOUSE AND SHE BEGUILED
HARETON WHO HAD PERFECTLY RECOVERED FROM HIS ACCIDENT TO DIG AND
ARRANGE HER LITTLE GARDEN WHICH WAS SHIFTED TO THAT CORNER BY THE
INFLUENCE OF JOSEPH'S COMPLAINTS
I WAS COMFORTABLY REVELLING IN THE
SPRING FRAGRANCE AROUND AND THE BEAUTIFUL SOFT BLUE OVERHEAD WHEN MY
YOUNG LADY WHO HAD RUN DOWN NEAR THE GATE TO PROCURE SOME PRIMROSE ROOTS
FOR A BORDER RETURNED ONLY HALF LADEN AND INFORMED US THAT MR
HEATHCLIFF WAS COMING IN
'AND HE SPOKE TO ME SHE ADDED WITH A
PERPLEXED COUNTENANCE
'WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED HARETON
'HE TOLD ME TO BEGONE AS FAST AS I COULD SHE ANSWERED
'BUT HE LOOKED
SO DIFFERENT FROM HIS USUAL LOOK THAT I STOPPED A MOMENT TO STARE AT
HIM
'HOW HE INQUIRED
'WHY ALMOST BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL
NO ALMOST NOTHING VERY MUCH
EXCITED AND WILD AND GLAD SHE REPLIED
'NIGHT WALKING AMUSES HIM THEN I REMARKED AFFECTING A CARELESS
MANNER IN REALITY AS SURPRISED AS SHE WAS AND ANXIOUS TO ASCERTAIN THE
TRUTH OF HER STATEMENT FOR TO SEE THE MASTER LOOKING GLAD WOULD NOT BE
AN EVERY DAY SPECTACLE
I FRAMED AN EXCUSE TO GO IN
HEATHCLIFF STOOD
AT THE OPEN DOOR HE WAS PALE AND HE TREMBLED YET CERTAINLY HE HAD A
STRANGE JOYFUL GLITTER IN HIS EYES THAT ALTERED THE ASPECT OF HIS WHOLE
FACE
'WILL YOU HAVE SOME BREAKFAST I SAID
'YOU MUST BE HUNGRY RAMBLING
ABOUT ALL NIGHT I WANTED TO DISCOVER WHERE HE HAD BEEN BUT I DID NOT
LIKE TO ASK DIRECTLY
'NO I'M NOT HUNGRY HE ANSWERED AVERTING HIS HEAD AND SPEAKING RATHER
CONTEMPTUOUSLY AS IF HE GUESSED I WAS TRYING TO DIVINE THE OCCASION OF
HIS GOOD HUMOUR
I FELT PERPLEXED I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WERE NOT A PROPER OPPORTUNITY
TO OFFER A BIT OF ADMONITION
'I DON'T THINK IT RIGHT TO WANDER OUT OF DOORS I OBSERVED 'INSTEAD OF
BEING IN BED IT IS NOT WISE AT ANY RATE THIS MOIST SEASON
I DARESAY
YOU'LL CATCH A BAD COLD OR A FEVER YOU HAVE SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH
YOU NOW
'NOTHING BUT WHAT I CAN BEAR HE REPLIED 'AND WITH THE GREATEST
PLEASURE PROVIDED YOU'LL LEAVE ME ALONE GET IN AND DON'T ANNOY ME
I OBEYED AND IN PASSING I NOTICED HE BREATHED AS FAST AS A CAT
'YES I REFLECTED TO MYSELF 'WE SHALL HAVE A FIT OF ILLNESS
I CANNOT
CONCEIVE WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING
THAT NOON HE SAT DOWN TO DINNER WITH US AND RECEIVED A HEAPED UP PLATE
FROM MY HANDS AS IF HE INTENDED TO MAKE AMENDS FOR PREVIOUS FASTING
'I'VE NEITHER COLD NOR FEVER NELLY HE REMARKED IN ALLUSION TO MY
MORNING'S SPEECH 'AND I'M READY TO DO JUSTICE TO THE FOOD YOU GIVE ME
HE TOOK HIS KNIFE AND FORK AND WAS GOING TO COMMENCE EATING WHEN THE
INCLINATION APPEARED TO BECOME SUDDENLY EXTINCT
HE LAID THEM ON THE
TABLE LOOKED EAGERLY TOWARDS THE WINDOW THEN ROSE AND WENT OUT
WE SAW
HIM WALKING TO AND FRO IN THE GARDEN WHILE WE CONCLUDED OUR MEAL AND
EARNSHAW SAID HE'D GO AND ASK WHY HE WOULD NOT DINE HE THOUGHT WE HAD
GRIEVED HIM SOME WAY
'WELL IS HE COMING CRIED CATHERINE WHEN HER COUSIN RETURNED
'NAY HE ANSWERED 'BUT HE'S NOT ANGRY HE SEEMED RARELY PLEASED INDEED
ONLY I MADE HIM IMPATIENT BY SPEAKING TO HIM TWICE AND THEN HE BID ME BE
OFF TO YOU HE WONDERED HOW I COULD WANT THE COMPANY OF ANYBODY ELSE
I SET HIS PLATE TO KEEP WARM ON THE FENDER AND AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO HE
RE ENTERED WHEN THE ROOM WAS CLEAR IN NO DEGREE CALMER THE SAME
UNNATURAL IT WAS UNNATURAL APPEARANCE OF JOY UNDER HIS BLACK BROWS THE
SAME BLOODLESS HUE AND HIS TEETH VISIBLE NOW AND THEN IN A KIND OF
SMILE HIS FRAME SHIVERING NOT AS ONE SHIVERS WITH CHILL OR WEAKNESS
BUT AS A TIGHT STRETCHED CORD VIBRATES A STRONG THRILLING RATHER THAN
TREMBLING
I WILL ASK WHAT IS THE MATTER I THOUGHT OR WHO SHOULD AND I
EXCLAIMED 'HAVE YOU HEARD ANY GOOD NEWS MR
HEATHCLIFF YOU LOOK
UNCOMMONLY ANIMATED
'WHERE SHOULD GOOD NEWS COME FROM TO ME HE SAID
'I'M ANIMATED WITH
HUNGER AND SEEMINGLY I MUST NOT EAT
'YOUR DINNER IS HERE I RETURNED 'WHY WON'T YOU GET IT
'I DON'T WANT IT NOW HE MUTTERED HASTILY 'I'LL WAIT TILL SUPPER
AND
NELLY ONCE FOR ALL LET ME BEG YOU TO WARN HARETON AND THE OTHER AWAY
FROM ME
I WISH TO BE TROUBLED BY NOBODY I WISH TO HAVE THIS PLACE TO
MYSELF
'IS THERE SOME NEW REASON FOR THIS BANISHMENT I INQUIRED
'TELL ME WHY
YOU ARE SO QUEER MR
HEATHCLIFF WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT I'M NOT
PUTTING THE QUESTION THROUGH IDLE CURIOSITY BUT
'YOU ARE PUTTING THE QUESTION THROUGH VERY IDLE CURIOSITY HE
INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH
'YET I'LL ANSWER IT
LAST NIGHT I WAS ON THE
THRESHOLD OF HELL
TO DAY I AM WITHIN SIGHT OF MY HEAVEN
I HAVE MY
EYES ON IT HARDLY THREE FEET TO SEVER ME AND NOW YOU'D BETTER GO
YOU'LL NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR ANYTHING TO FRIGHTEN YOU IF YOU REFRAIN FROM
PRYING
HAVING SWEPT THE HEARTH AND WIPED THE TABLE I DEPARTED MORE PERPLEXED
THAN EVER
HE DID NOT QUIT THE HOUSE AGAIN THAT AFTERNOON AND NO ONE INTRUDED ON
HIS SOLITUDE TILL AT EIGHT O'CLOCK I DEEMED IT PROPER THOUGH
UNSUMMONED TO CARRY A CANDLE AND HIS SUPPER TO HIM
HE WAS LEANING
AGAINST THE LEDGE OF AN OPEN LATTICE BUT NOT LOOKING OUT HIS FACE WAS
TURNED TO THE INTERIOR GLOOM
THE FIRE HAD SMOULDERED TO ASHES THE ROOM
WAS FILLED WITH THE DAMP MILD AIR OF THE CLOUDY EVENING AND SO STILL
THAT NOT ONLY THE MURMUR OF THE BECK DOWN GIMMERTON WAS DISTINGUISHABLE
BUT ITS RIPPLES AND ITS GURGLING OVER THE PEBBLES OR THROUGH THE LARGE
STONES WHICH IT COULD NOT COVER
I UTTERED AN EJACULATION OF DISCONTENT
AT SEEING THE DISMAL GRATE AND COMMENCED SHUTTING THE CASEMENTS ONE
AFTER ANOTHER TILL I CAME TO HIS
'MUST I CLOSE THIS I ASKED IN ORDER TO ROUSE HIM FOR HE WOULD NOT
STIR
THE LIGHT FLASHED ON HIS FEATURES AS I SPOKE
OH MR
LOCKWOOD I CANNOT
EXPRESS WHAT A TERRIBLE START I GOT BY THE MOMENTARY VIEW THOSE DEEP
BLACK EYES THAT SMILE AND GHASTLY PALENESS IT APPEARED TO ME NOT
MR
HEATHCLIFF BUT A GOBLIN AND IN MY TERROR I LET THE CANDLE BEND
TOWARDS THE WALL AND IT LEFT ME IN DARKNESS
'YES CLOSE IT HE REPLIED IN HIS FAMILIAR VOICE
'THERE THAT IS PURE
AWKWARDNESS WHY DID YOU HOLD THE CANDLE HORIZONTALLY BE QUICK AND
BRING ANOTHER
I HURRIED OUT IN A FOOLISH STATE OF DREAD AND SAID TO JOSEPH 'THE
MASTER WISHES YOU TO TAKE HIM A LIGHT AND REKINDLE THE FIRE FOR I
DARED NOT GO IN MYSELF AGAIN JUST THEN
JOSEPH RATTLED SOME FIRE INTO THE SHOVEL AND WENT BUT HE BROUGHT IT
BACK IMMEDIATELY WITH THE SUPPER TRAY IN HIS OTHER HAND EXPLAINING THAT
MR
HEATHCLIFF WAS GOING TO BED AND HE WANTED NOTHING TO EAT TILL
MORNING
WE HEARD HIM MOUNT THE STAIRS DIRECTLY HE DID NOT PROCEED TO
HIS ORDINARY CHAMBER BUT TURNED INTO THAT WITH THE PANELLED BED ITS
WINDOW AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IS WIDE ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY TO GET THROUGH
AND IT STRUCK ME THAT HE PLOTTED ANOTHER MIDNIGHT EXCURSION OF WHICH HE
HAD RATHER WE HAD NO SUSPICION
'IS HE A GHOUL OR A VAMPIRE I MUSED
I HAD READ OF SUCH HIDEOUS
INCARNATE DEMONS
AND THEN I SET MYSELF TO REFLECT HOW I HAD TENDED HIM
IN INFANCY AND WATCHED HIM GROW TO YOUTH AND FOLLOWED HIM ALMOST
THROUGH HIS WHOLE COURSE AND WHAT ABSURD NONSENSE IT WAS TO YIELD TO
THAT SENSE OF HORROR
'BUT WHERE DID HE COME FROM THE LITTLE DARK
THING HARBOURED BY A GOOD MAN TO HIS BANE MUTTERED SUPERSTITION AS I
DOZED INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS
AND I BEGAN HALF DREAMING TO WEARY MYSELF
WITH IMAGINING SOME FIT PARENTAGE FOR HIM AND REPEATING MY WAKING
MEDITATIONS I TRACKED HIS EXISTENCE OVER AGAIN WITH GRIM VARIATIONS AT
LAST PICTURING HIS DEATH AND FUNERAL OF WHICH ALL I CAN REMEMBER IS
BEING EXCEEDINGLY VEXED AT HAVING THE TASK OF DICTATING AN INSCRIPTION
FOR HIS MONUMENT AND CONSULTING THE SEXTON ABOUT IT AND AS HE HAD NO
SURNAME AND WE COULD NOT TELL HIS AGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO CONTENT
OURSELVES WITH THE SINGLE WORD 'HEATHCLIFF THAT CAME TRUE WE WERE
IF YOU ENTER THE KIRKYARD YOU'LL READ ON HIS HEADSTONE ONLY THAT AND
THE DATE OF HIS DEATH
DAWN RESTORED ME TO COMMON SENSE
I ROSE AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN AS
SOON AS I COULD SEE TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE WERE ANY FOOTMARKS UNDER HIS
WINDOW
THERE WERE NONE
'HE HAS STAYED AT HOME I THOUGHT 'AND HE'LL
BE ALL RIGHT TO DAY I PREPARED BREAKFAST FOR THE HOUSEHOLD AS WAS MY
USUAL CUSTOM BUT TOLD HARETON AND CATHERINE TO GET THEIRS ERE THE MASTER
CAME DOWN FOR HE LAY LATE
THEY PREFERRED TAKING IT OUT OF DOORS UNDER
THE TREES AND I SET A LITTLE TABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THEM
ON MY RE ENTRANCE I FOUND MR
HEATHCLIFF BELOW
HE AND JOSEPH WERE
CONVERSING ABOUT SOME FARMING BUSINESS HE GAVE CLEAR MINUTE DIRECTIONS
CONCERNING THE MATTER DISCUSSED BUT HE SPOKE RAPIDLY AND TURNED HIS
HEAD CONTINUALLY ASIDE AND HAD THE SAME EXCITED EXPRESSION EVEN MORE
EXAGGERATED
WHEN JOSEPH QUITTED THE ROOM HE TOOK HIS SEAT IN THE PLACE
HE GENERALLY CHOSE AND I PUT A BASIN OF COFFEE BEFORE HIM
HE DREW IT
NEARER AND THEN RESTED HIS ARMS ON THE TABLE AND LOOKED AT THE OPPOSITE
WALL AS I SUPPOSED SURVEYING ONE PARTICULAR PORTION UP AND DOWN WITH
GLITTERING RESTLESS EYES AND WITH SUCH EAGER INTEREST THAT HE STOPPED
BREATHING DURING HALF A MINUTE TOGETHER
'COME NOW I EXCLAIMED PUSHING SOME BREAD AGAINST HIS HAND 'EAT AND
DRINK THAT WHILE IT IS HOT IT HAS BEEN WAITING NEAR AN HOUR
HE DIDN'T NOTICE ME AND YET HE SMILED
I'D RATHER HAVE SEEN HIM GNASH
HIS TEETH THAN SMILE SO
'MR
HEATHCLIFF MASTER I CRIED 'DON'T FOR GOD'S SAKE STARE AS IF
YOU SAW AN UNEARTHLY VISION
'DON'T FOR GOD'S SAKE SHOUT SO LOUD HE REPLIED
'TURN ROUND AND
TELL ME ARE WE BY OURSELVES
'OF COURSE WAS MY ANSWER 'OF COURSE WE ARE
STILL I INVOLUNTARILY OBEYED HIM AS IF I WAS NOT QUITE SURE
WITH A
SWEEP OF HIS HAND HE CLEARED A VACANT SPACE IN FRONT AMONG THE BREAKFAST
THINGS AND LEANT FORWARD TO GAZE MORE AT HIS EASE
NOW I PERCEIVED HE WAS NOT LOOKING AT THE WALL FOR WHEN I REGARDED HIM
ALONE IT SEEMED EXACTLY THAT HE GAZED AT SOMETHING WITHIN TWO YARDS'
DISTANCE
AND WHATEVER IT WAS IT COMMUNICATED APPARENTLY BOTH
PLEASURE AND PAIN IN EXQUISITE EXTREMES AT LEAST THE ANGUISHED YET
RAPTURED EXPRESSION OF HIS COUNTENANCE SUGGESTED THAT IDEA
THE FANCIED
OBJECT WAS NOT FIXED EITHER HIS EYES PURSUED IT WITH UNWEARIED
DILIGENCE AND EVEN IN SPEAKING TO ME WERE NEVER WEANED AWAY
I VAINLY
REMINDED HIM OF HIS PROTRACTED ABSTINENCE FROM FOOD IF HE STIRRED TO
TOUCH ANYTHING IN COMPLIANCE WITH MY ENTREATIES IF HE STRETCHED HIS HAND
OUT TO GET A PIECE OF BREAD HIS FINGERS CLENCHED BEFORE THEY REACHED IT
AND REMAINED ON THE TABLE FORGETFUL OF THEIR AIM
I SAT A MODEL OF PATIENCE TRYING TO ATTRACT HIS ABSORBED ATTENTION FROM
ITS ENGROSSING SPECULATION TILL HE GREW IRRITABLE AND GOT UP ASKING
WHY I WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO HAVE HIS OWN TIME IN TAKING HIS MEALS AND
SAYING THAT ON THE NEXT OCCASION I NEEDN'T WAIT I MIGHT SET THE THINGS
DOWN AND GO
HAVING UTTERED THESE WORDS HE LEFT THE HOUSE SLOWLY
SAUNTERED DOWN THE GARDEN PATH AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE GATE
THE HOURS CREPT ANXIOUSLY BY ANOTHER EVENING CAME
I DID NOT RETIRE TO
REST TILL LATE AND WHEN I DID I COULD NOT SLEEP
HE RETURNED AFTER
MIDNIGHT AND INSTEAD OF GOING TO BED SHUT HIMSELF INTO THE ROOM
BENEATH
I LISTENED AND TOSSED ABOUT AND FINALLY DRESSED AND
DESCENDED
IT WAS TOO IRKSOME TO LIE THERE HARASSING MY BRAIN WITH A
HUNDRED IDLE MISGIVINGS
I DISTINGUISHED MR
HEATHCLIFF'S STEP RESTLESSLY MEASURING THE FLOOR
AND HE FREQUENTLY BROKE THE SILENCE BY A DEEP INSPIRATION RESEMBLING A
GROAN
HE MUTTERED DETACHED WORDS ALSO THE ONLY ONE I COULD CATCH WAS
THE NAME OF CATHERINE COUPLED WITH SOME WILD TERM OF ENDEARMENT OR
SUFFERING AND SPOKEN AS ONE WOULD SPEAK TO A PERSON PRESENT LOW AND
EARNEST AND WRUNG FROM THE DEPTH OF HIS SOUL
I HAD NOT COURAGE TO WALK
STRAIGHT INTO THE APARTMENT BUT I DESIRED TO DIVERT HIM FROM HIS
REVERIE AND THEREFORE FELL FOUL OF THE KITCHEN FIRE STIRRED IT AND
BEGAN TO SCRAPE THE CINDERS
IT DREW HIM FORTH SOONER THAN I EXPECTED
HE OPENED THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY AND SAID 'NELLY COME HERE IS IT
MORNING COME IN WITH YOUR LIGHT
'IT IS STRIKING FOUR I ANSWERED
'YOU WANT A CANDLE TO TAKE UP STAIRS
YOU MIGHT HAVE LIT ONE AT THIS FIRE
'NO I DON'T WISH TO GO UP STAIRS HE SAID
'COME IN AND KINDLE ME A
FIRE AND DO ANYTHING THERE IS TO DO ABOUT THE ROOM
'I MUST BLOW THE COALS RED FIRST BEFORE I CAN CARRY ANY I REPLIED
GETTING A CHAIR AND THE BELLOWS
HE ROAMED TO AND FRO MEANTIME IN A STATE APPROACHING DISTRACTION HIS
HEAVY SIGHS SUCCEEDING EACH OTHER SO THICK AS TO LEAVE NO SPACE FOR
COMMON BREATHING BETWEEN
'WHEN DAY BREAKS I'LL SEND FOR GREEN HE SAID 'I WISH TO MAKE SOME
LEGAL INQUIRIES OF HIM WHILE I CAN BESTOW A THOUGHT ON THOSE MATTERS AND
WHILE I CAN ACT CALMLY
I HAVE NOT WRITTEN MY WILL YET AND HOW TO LEAVE
MY PROPERTY I CANNOT DETERMINE
I WISH I COULD ANNIHILATE IT FROM THE
FACE OF THE EARTH
'I WOULD NOT TALK SO MR
HEATHCLIFF I INTERPOSED
'LET YOUR WILL BE A
WHILE YOU'LL BE SPARED TO REPENT OF YOUR MANY INJUSTICES YET I NEVER
EXPECTED THAT YOUR NERVES WOULD BE DISORDERED THEY ARE AT PRESENT
MARVELLOUSLY SO HOWEVER AND ALMOST ENTIRELY THROUGH YOUR OWN FAULT
THE WAY YOU'VE PASSED THESE THREE LAST DAYS MIGHT KNOCK UP A TITAN
DO
TAKE SOME FOOD AND SOME REPOSE
YOU NEED ONLY LOOK AT YOURSELF IN A
GLASS TO SEE HOW YOU REQUIRE BOTH
YOUR CHEEKS ARE HOLLOW AND YOUR EYES
BLOOD SHOT LIKE A PERSON STARVING WITH HUNGER AND GOING BLIND WITH LOSS
OF SLEEP
'IT IS NOT MY FAULT THAT I CANNOT EAT OR REST HE REPLIED
'I ASSURE
YOU IT IS THROUGH NO SETTLED DESIGNS
I'LL DO BOTH AS SOON AS I
POSSIBLY CAN
BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL BID A MAN STRUGGLING IN THE WATER
REST WITHIN ARMS' LENGTH OF THE SHORE I MUST REACH IT FIRST AND THEN
I'LL REST
WELL NEVER MIND MR
GREEN AS TO REPENTING OF MY INJUSTICES
I'VE DONE NO INJUSTICE AND I REPENT OF NOTHING
I'M TOO HAPPY AND YET
I'M NOT HAPPY ENOUGH
MY SOUL'S BLISS KILLS MY BODY BUT DOES NOT
SATISFY ITSELF
'HAPPY MASTER I CRIED
'STRANGE HAPPINESS IF YOU WOULD HEAR ME
WITHOUT BEING ANGRY I MIGHT OFFER SOME ADVICE THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
HAPPIER
'WHAT IS THAT HE ASKED
'GIVE IT
'YOU ARE AWARE MR
HEATHCLIFF I SAID 'THAT FROM THE TIME YOU WERE
THIRTEEN YEARS OLD YOU HAVE LIVED A SELFISH UNCHRISTIAN LIFE AND
PROBABLY HARDLY HAD A BIBLE IN YOUR HANDS DURING ALL THAT PERIOD
YOU
MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE SPACE
TO SEARCH IT NOW
COULD IT BE HURTFUL TO SEND FOR SOME ONE SOME
MINISTER OF ANY DENOMINATION IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH TO EXPLAIN IT
AND SHOW YOU HOW VERY FAR YOU HAVE ERRED FROM ITS PRECEPTS AND HOW UNFIT
YOU WILL BE FOR ITS HEAVEN UNLESS A CHANGE TAKES PLACE BEFORE YOU DIE
'I'M RATHER OBLIGED THAN ANGRY NELLY HE SAID 'FOR YOU REMIND ME OF
THE MANNER IN WHICH I DESIRE TO BE BURIED
IT IS TO BE CARRIED TO THE
CHURCHYARD IN THE EVENING
YOU AND HARETON MAY IF YOU PLEASE ACCOMPANY
ME AND MIND PARTICULARLY TO NOTICE THAT THE SEXTON OBEYS MY DIRECTIONS
CONCERNING THE TWO COFFINS NO MINISTER NEED COME NOR NEED ANYTHING BE
SAID OVER ME I TELL YOU I HAVE NEARLY ATTAINED MY HEAVEN AND THAT OF
OTHERS IS ALTOGETHER UNVALUED AND UNCOVETED BY ME
'AND SUPPOSING YOU PERSEVERED IN YOUR OBSTINATE FAST AND DIED BY THAT
MEANS AND THEY REFUSED TO BURY YOU IN THE PRECINCTS OF THE KIRK I
SAID SHOCKED AT HIS GODLESS INDIFFERENCE
'HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
'THEY WON'T DO THAT HE REPLIED 'IF THEY DID YOU MUST HAVE ME REMOVED
SECRETLY AND IF YOU NEGLECT IT YOU SHALL PROVE PRACTICALLY THAT THE
DEAD ARE NOT ANNIHILATED
AS SOON AS HE HEARD THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY STIRRING HE RETIRED
TO HIS DEN AND I BREATHED FREER
BUT IN THE AFTERNOON WHILE JOSEPH AND
HARETON WERE AT THEIR WORK HE CAME INTO THE KITCHEN AGAIN AND WITH A
WILD LOOK BID ME COME AND SIT IN THE HOUSE HE WANTED SOMEBODY WITH HIM
I DECLINED TELLING HIM PLAINLY THAT HIS STRANGE TALK AND MANNER
FRIGHTENED ME AND I HAD NEITHER THE NERVE NOR THE WILL TO BE HIS
COMPANION ALONE
'I BELIEVE YOU THINK ME A FIEND HE SAID WITH HIS DISMAL LAUGH
'SOMETHING TOO HORRIBLE TO LIVE UNDER A DECENT ROOF THEN TURNING TO
CATHERINE WHO WAS THERE AND WHO DREW BEHIND ME AT HIS APPROACH HE
ADDED HALF SNEERINGLY 'WILL YOU COME CHUCK I'LL NOT HURT YOU
NO
TO YOU I'VE MADE MYSELF WORSE THAN THE DEVIL
WELL THERE IS ONE WHO
WON'T SHRINK FROM MY COMPANY BY GOD SHE'S RELENTLESS
OH DAMN IT
IT'S UNUTTERABLY TOO MUCH FOR FLESH AND BLOOD TO BEAR EVEN MINE
HE SOLICITED THE SOCIETY OF NO ONE MORE
AT DUSK HE WENT INTO HIS
CHAMBER
THROUGH THE WHOLE NIGHT AND FAR INTO THE MORNING WE HEARD HIM
GROANING AND MURMURING TO HIMSELF
HARETON WAS ANXIOUS TO ENTER BUT I
BID HIM FETCH MR
KENNETH AND HE SHOULD GO IN AND SEE HIM
WHEN HE
CAME AND I REQUESTED ADMITTANCE AND TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR I FOUND IT
LOCKED AND HEATHCLIFF BID US BE DAMNED
HE WAS BETTER AND WOULD BE
LEFT ALONE SO THE DOCTOR WENT AWAY
THE FOLLOWING EVENING WAS VERY WET INDEED IT POURED DOWN TILL DAY DAWN
AND AS I TOOK MY MORNING WALK ROUND THE HOUSE I OBSERVED THE MASTER'S
WINDOW SWINGING OPEN AND THE RAIN DRIVING STRAIGHT IN
HE CANNOT BE IN
BED I THOUGHT THOSE SHOWERS WOULD DRENCH HIM THROUGH
HE MUST EITHER
BE UP OR OUT
BUT I'LL MAKE NO MORE ADO I'LL GO BOLDLY AND LOOK
HAVING SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING ENTRANCE WITH ANOTHER KEY I RAN TO UNCLOSE
THE PANELS FOR THE CHAMBER WAS VACANT QUICKLY PUSHING THEM ASIDE I
PEEPED IN
MR
HEATHCLIFF WAS THERE LAID ON HIS BACK
HIS EYES MET
MINE SO KEEN AND FIERCE I STARTED AND THEN HE SEEMED TO SMILE
I COULD
NOT THINK HIM DEAD BUT HIS FACE AND THROAT WERE WASHED WITH RAIN THE
BED CLOTHES DRIPPED AND HE WAS PERFECTLY STILL
THE LATTICE FLAPPING
TO AND FRO HAD GRAZED ONE HAND THAT RESTED ON THE SILL NO BLOOD
TRICKLED FROM THE BROKEN SKIN AND WHEN I PUT MY FINGERS TO IT I COULD
DOUBT NO MORE HE WAS DEAD AND STARK
I HASPED THE WINDOW I COMBED HIS BLACK LONG HAIR FROM HIS FOREHEAD I
TRIED TO CLOSE HIS EYES TO EXTINGUISH IF POSSIBLE THAT FRIGHTFUL
LIFE LIKE GAZE OF EXULTATION BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE BEHELD IT
THEY WOULD
NOT SHUT THEY SEEMED TO SNEER AT MY ATTEMPTS AND HIS PARTED LIPS AND
SHARP WHITE TEETH SNEERED TOO TAKEN WITH ANOTHER FIT OF COWARDICE I
CRIED OUT FOR JOSEPH
JOSEPH SHUFFLED UP AND MADE A NOISE BUT
RESOLUTELY REFUSED TO MEDDLE WITH HIM
'TH' DIVIL'S HARRIED OFF HIS SOUL HE CRIED 'AND HE MAY HEV' HIS
CARCASS INTO T' BARGIN FOR AUGHT I CARE ECH WHAT A WICKED 'UN HE
LOOKS GIRNING AT DEATH AND THE OLD SINNER GRINNED IN MOCKERY
I
THOUGHT HE INTENDED TO CUT A CAPER ROUND THE BED BUT SUDDENLY COMPOSING
HIMSELF HE FELL ON HIS KNEES AND RAISED HIS HANDS AND RETURNED THANKS
THAT THE LAWFUL MASTER AND THE ANCIENT STOCK WERE RESTORED TO THEIR
RIGHTS
I FELT STUNNED BY THE AWFUL EVENT AND MY MEMORY UNAVOIDABLY RECURRED TO
FORMER TIMES WITH A SORT OF OPPRESSIVE SADNESS
BUT POOR HARETON THE
MOST WRONGED WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REALLY SUFFERED MUCH
HE SAT BY THE
CORPSE ALL NIGHT WEEPING IN BITTER EARNEST
HE PRESSED ITS HAND AND
KISSED THE SARCASTIC SAVAGE FACE THAT EVERY ONE ELSE SHRANK FROM
CONTEMPLATING AND BEMOANED HIM WITH THAT STRONG GRIEF WHICH SPRINGS
NATURALLY FROM A GENEROUS HEART THOUGH IT BE TOUGH AS TEMPERED STEEL
MR
KENNETH WAS PERPLEXED TO PRONOUNCE OF WHAT DISORDER THE MASTER DIED
I CONCEALED THE FACT OF HIS HAVING SWALLOWED NOTHING FOR FOUR DAYS
FEARING IT MIGHT LEAD TO TROUBLE AND THEN I AM PERSUADED HE DID NOT
ABSTAIN ON PURPOSE IT WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS STRANGE ILLNESS NOT
THE CAUSE
WE BURIED HIM TO THE SCANDAL OF THE WHOLE NEIGHBOURHOOD AS HE WISHED
EARNSHAW AND I THE SEXTON AND SIX MEN TO CARRY THE COFFIN COMPREHENDED
THE WHOLE ATTENDANCE
THE SIX MEN DEPARTED WHEN THEY HAD LET IT DOWN
INTO THE GRAVE WE STAYED TO SEE IT COVERED
HARETON WITH A STREAMING
FACE DUG GREEN SODS AND LAID THEM OVER THE BROWN MOULD HIMSELF AT
PRESENT IT IS AS SMOOTH AND VERDANT AS ITS COMPANION MOUNDS AND I HOPE
ITS TENANT SLEEPS AS SOUNDLY
BUT THE COUNTRY FOLKS IF YOU ASK THEM
WOULD SWEAR ON THE BIBLE THAT HE WALKS THERE ARE THOSE WHO SPEAK TO
HAVING MET HIM NEAR THE CHURCH AND ON THE MOOR AND EVEN WITHIN THIS
HOUSE
IDLE TALES YOU'LL SAY AND SO SAY I
YET THAT OLD MAN BY THE
KITCHEN FIRE AFFIRMS HE HAS SEEN TWO ON 'EM LOOKING OUT OF HIS CHAMBER
WINDOW ON EVERY RAINY NIGHT SINCE HIS DEATH AND AN ODD THING HAPPENED
TO ME ABOUT A MONTH AGO
I WAS GOING TO THE GRANGE ONE EVENING A DARK
EVENING THREATENING THUNDER AND JUST AT THE TURN OF THE HEIGHTS I
ENCOUNTERED A LITTLE BOY WITH A SHEEP AND TWO LAMBS BEFORE HIM HE WAS
CRYING TERRIBLY AND I SUPPOSED THE LAMBS WERE SKITTISH AND WOULD NOT BE
GUIDED
'WHAT IS THE MATTER MY LITTLE MAN I ASKED
'THERE'S HEATHCLIFF AND A WOMAN YONDER UNDER T' NAB HE BLUBBERED 'UN'
I DARNUT PASS 'EM
I SAW NOTHING BUT NEITHER THE SHEEP NOR HE WOULD GO ON SO I BID HIM TAKE
THE ROAD LOWER DOWN
HE PROBABLY RAISED THE PHANTOMS FROM THINKING AS
HE TRAVERSED THE MOORS ALONE ON THE NONSENSE HE HAD HEARD HIS PARENTS
AND COMPANIONS REPEAT
YET STILL I DON'T LIKE BEING OUT IN THE DARK
NOW AND I DON'T LIKE BEING LEFT BY MYSELF IN THIS GRIM HOUSE I CANNOT
HELP IT I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN THEY LEAVE IT AND SHIFT TO THE GRANGE
'THEY ARE GOING TO THE GRANGE THEN I SAID
'YES ANSWERED MRS
DEAN 'AS SOON AS THEY ARE MARRIED AND THAT WILL BE
ON NEW YEAR'S DAY
'AND WHO WILL LIVE HERE THEN
'WHY JOSEPH WILL TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSE AND PERHAPS A LAD TO KEEP HIM
COMPANY
THEY WILL LIVE IN THE KITCHEN AND THE REST WILL BE SHUT UP
'FOR THE USE OF SUCH GHOSTS AS CHOOSE TO INHABIT IT I OBSERVED
'NO MR
LOCKWOOD SAID NELLY SHAKING HER HEAD
'I BELIEVE THE DEAD
ARE AT PEACE BUT IT IS NOT RIGHT TO SPEAK OF THEM WITH LEVITY
AT THAT MOMENT THE GARDEN GATE SWUNG TO THE RAMBLERS WERE RETURNING
THEY ARE AFRAID OF NOTHING I GRUMBLED WATCHING THEIR APPROACH
THROUGH THE WINDOW
'TOGETHER THEY WOULD BRAVE SATAN AND ALL HIS
LEGIONS
AS THEY STEPPED ON TO THE DOOR STONES AND HALTED TO TAKE A LAST LOOK AT
THE MOON OR MORE CORRECTLY AT EACH OTHER BY HER LIGHT I FELT
IRRESISTIBLY IMPELLED TO ESCAPE THEM AGAIN AND PRESSING A REMEMBRANCE
INTO THE HAND OF MRS
DEAN AND DISREGARDING HER EXPOSTULATIONS AT MY
RUDENESS I VANISHED THROUGH THE KITCHEN AS THEY OPENED THE HOUSE DOOR
AND SO SHOULD HAVE CONFIRMED JOSEPH IN HIS OPINION OF HIS
FELLOW SERVANT'S GAY INDISCRETIONS HAD HE NOT FORTUNATELY RECOGNISED ME
FOR A RESPECTABLE CHARACTER BY THE SWEET RING OF A SOVEREIGN AT HIS FEET
MY WALK HOME WAS LENGTHENED BY A DIVERSION IN THE DIRECTION OF THE KIRK
WHEN BENEATH ITS WALLS I PERCEIVED DECAY HAD MADE PROGRESS EVEN IN
SEVEN MONTHS MANY A WINDOW SHOWED BLACK GAPS DEPRIVED OF GLASS AND
SLATES JUTTED OFF HERE AND THERE BEYOND THE RIGHT LINE OF THE ROOF TO
BE GRADUALLY WORKED OFF IN COMING AUTUMN STORMS
I SOUGHT AND SOON DISCOVERED THE THREE HEADSTONES ON THE SLOPE NEXT THE
MOOR THE MIDDLE ONE GREY AND HALF BURIED IN THE HEATH EDGAR LINTON'S
ONLY HARMONIZED BY THE TURF AND MOSS CREEPING UP ITS FOOT HEATHCLIFF'S
STILL BARE
I LINGERED ROUND THEM UNDER THAT BENIGN SKY WATCHED THE MOTHS
FLUTTERING AMONG THE HEATH AND HAREBELLS LISTENED TO THE SOFT WIND
BREATHING THROUGH THE GRASS AND WONDERED HOW ANY ONE COULD EVER IMAGINE
UNQUIET SLUMBERS FOR THE SLEEPERS IN THAT QUIET EARTH
