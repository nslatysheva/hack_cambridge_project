PREFACE
THE OBJECT OF THIS VOLUME IS TO PLACE BEFORE THE GENERAL READER
OUR TWO EARLY POETIC MASTERPIECES THE CANTERBURY TALES AND
THE FAERIE QUEEN TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT WILL RENDER THEIR
POPULAR PERUSAL EASY IN A TIME OF LITTLE LEISURE AND UNBOUNDED
TEMPTATIONS TO INTELLECTUAL LANGUOR AND ON THE SAME CONDITIONS
TO PRESENT A LIBERAL AND FAIRLY REPRESENTATIVE SELECTION FROM THE
LESS IMPORTANT AND FAMILIAR POEMS OF CHAUCER AND SPENSER
THERE IS IT MAY BE SAID AT THE OUTSET PECULIAR ADVANTAGE AND
PROPRIETY IN PLACING THE TWO POETS SIDE BY SIDE IN THE MANNER
NOW ATTEMPTED FOR THE FIRST TIME
ALTHOUGH TWO CENTURIES DIVIDE
THEM YET SPENSER IS THE DIRECT AND REALLY THE IMMEDIATE
SUCCESSOR TO THE POETICAL INHERITANCE OF CHAUCER
THOSE TWO
HUNDRED YEARS EVENTFUL AS THEY WERE PRODUCED NO POET AT ALL
WORTHY TO TAKE UP THE MANTLE THAT FELL FROM CHAUCER'S SHOULDERS
AND SPENSER DOES NOT NEED HIS AFFECTED ARCHAISMS NOR HIS
FREQUENT AND REVERENT APPEALS TO DAN GEFFREY TO VINDICATE FOR
HIMSELF A PLACE VERY CLOSE TO HIS GREAT PREDECESSOR IN THE LITERARY
HISTORY OF ENGLAND
IF CHAUCER IS THE WELL OF ENGLISH
UNDEFILED SPENSER IS THE BROAD AND STATELY RIVER THAT YET HOLDS
THE TENURE OF ITS VERY LIFE FROM THE FOUNTAIN FAR AWAY IN OTHER
AND RUDER SCENES
THE CANTERBURY TALES SO FAR AS THEY ARE IN VERSE HAVE BEEN
PRINTED WITHOUT ANY ABRIDGEMENT OR DESIGNED CHANGE IN THE
SENSE
BUT THE TWO TALES IN PROSE CHAUCER'S TALE OF
MELIBOEUS AND THE PARSON'S LONG SERMON ON PENITENCE HAVE
BEEN CONTRACTED SO AS TO EXCLUDE THIRTY PAGES OF UNATTRACTIVE
PROSE AND TO ADMIT THE SAME AMOUNT OF INTERESTING AND
CHARACTERISTIC POETRY
THE GAPS THUS MADE IN THE PROSE TALES
HOWEVER ARE SUPPLIED BY CAREFUL OUTLINES OF THE OMITTED MATTER
SO THAT THE READER NEED BE AT NO LOSS TO COMPREHEND THE WHOLE
SCOPE AND SEQUENCE OF THE ORIGINAL
WITH THE FAERIE QUEEN A
BOLDER COURSE HAS BEEN PURSUED
THE GREAT OBSTACLE TO THE
POPULARITY OF SPENCER'S SPLENDID WORK HAS LAIN LESS IN ITS
LANGUAGE THAN IN ITS LENGTH
IF WE ADD TOGETHER THE THREE GREAT
POEMS OF ANTIQUITY THE TWENTY FOUR BOOKS OF THE ILIAD THE
TWENTY FOUR BOOKS OF THE ODYSSEY AND THE TWELVE BOOKS OF THE
AENEID WE GET AT THE DIMENSIONS OF ONLY ONE HALF OF THE
FAERIE QUEEN
THE SIX BOOKS AND THE FRAGMENT OF A SEVENTH
WHICH ALONE EXIST OF THE AUTHOR'S CONTEMPLATED TWELVE NUMBER
ABOUT 35 000 VERSES THE SIXTY BOOKS OF HOMER AND VIRGIL
NUMBER NO MORE THAN 37 000
THE MERE BULK OF THE POEM THEN
HAS OPPOSED A FORMIDABLE BARRIER TO ITS POPULARITY TO SAY
NOTHING OF THE DISTRACTING EFFECT PRODUCED BY THE NUMBERLESS
EPISODES THE TEDIOUS NARRATIONS AND THE CONSTANT REPETITIONS
WHICH HAVE LARGELY SWELLED THAT BULK
IN THIS VOLUME THE POEM
IS COMPRESSED INTO TWO THIRDS OF ITS ORIGINAL SPACE THROUGH THE
EXPEDIENT OF REPRESENTING THE LESS INTERESTING AND MORE
MECHANICAL PASSAGES BY A CONDENSED PROSE OUTLINE IN WHICH IT
HAS BEEN SOUGHT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO PRESERVE THE VERY WORDS OF
THE POET
WHILE DEPRECATING A TOO CRITICAL JUDGEMENT ON THE
BARE AND CONSTRAINED PRECIS STANDING IN SUCH TRYING
JUXTAPOSITION IT IS HOPED THAT THE LABOUR BESTOWED IN SAVING THE
READER THE TROUBLE OF WADING THROUGH MUCH THAT IS NOT ESSENTIAL
FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF SPENCER'S MARVELLOUS ALLEGORY WILL NOT BE
UNAPPRECIATED
AS REGARDS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TEXT OF THE TWO GREAT WORKS
ESPECIALLY OF THE CANTERBURY TALES IS PRESENTED THE EDITOR IS
AWARE THAT SOME WHOSE JUDGEMENT IS WEIGHTY WILL DIFFER FROM
HIM
THIS VOLUME HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR POPULAR PERUSAL AND
ITS VERY RAISON D'ETRE WOULD HAVE FAILED IF THE ANCIENT
ORTHOGRAPHY HAD BEEN RETAINED
IT HAS OFTEN BEEN AFFIRMED BY
EDITORS OF CHAUCER IN THE OLD FORMS OF THE LANGUAGE THAT A LITTLE
TROUBLE AT FIRST WOULD RENDER THE ANTIQUATED SPELLING AND
OBSOLETE INFLECTIONS A CONTINUAL SOURCE NOT OF DIFFICULTY BUT OF
ACTUAL DELIGHT FOR THE READER COMING TO THE STUDY OF CHAUCER
WITHOUT ANY PRELIMINARY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ENGLISH OF HIS
DAY OR OF HIS COPYISTS' DAYS
DESPITE THIS COMPLACENT
ASSURANCE THE OBVIOUS FACT IS THAT CHAUCER IN THE OLD FORMS HAS
NOT BECOME POPULAR IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD HE IS NOT
UNDERSTANDED OF THE VULGAR IN THIS VOLUME THEREFORE THE TEXT
OF CHAUCER HAS BEEN PRESENTED IN NINETEENTH CENTURY GARB
BUT
THERE HAS BEEN NOT THE SLIGHTEST ATTEMPT TO MODERNISE
CHAUCER IN THE WIDER MEANING OF THE PHRASE TO REPLACE HIS
WORDS BY WORDS WHICH HE DID NOT USE OR FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE
OF SOME OPERATORS TO TRANSLATE HIM INTO ENGLISH OF THE MODERN
SPIRIT AS WELL AS THE MODERN FORMS
SO FAR FROM THAT IN EVERY
CASE WHERE THE OLD SPELLING OR FORM SEEMED ESSENTIAL TO METRE
TO RHYME OR MEANING NO CHANGE HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED
BUT
WHEREVER ITS PRESERVATION WAS NOT ESSENTIAL THE SPELLING OF THE
MONKISH TRANSCRIBERS FOR THE MOST ARDENT PURIST MUST NOW
DESPAIR OF GETTING AT THE SPELLING OF CHAUCER HIMSELF HAS BEEN
DISCARDED FOR THAT OF THE READER'S OWN DAY
IT IS A POOR
COMPLIMENT TO THE FATHER OF ENGLISH POETRY TO SAY THAT BY SUCH
TREATMENT THE BOUQUET AND INDIVIDUALITY OF HIS WORKS MUST BE
LOST
IF HIS MASTERPIECE IS VALUABLE FOR ONE THING MORE THAN ANY
OTHER IT IS THE VIVID DISTINCTNESS WITH WHICH ENGLISH MEN AND
WOMEN OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY ARE THERE PAINTED FOR THE STUDY
OF ALL THE CENTURIES TO FOLLOW
BUT WE WANTONLY BALK THE ARTIST'S
OWN PURPOSE AND DISCREDIT HIS LABOUR WHEN WE KEEP BEFORE HIS
PICTURE THE SCREEN OF DUST AND COBWEBS WHICH FOR THE ENGLISH
PEOPLE IN THESE DAYS THE CRUDE FORMS OF THE INFANT LANGUAGE
HAVE PRACTICALLY BECOME
SHAKESPEARE HAS NOT SUFFERED BY
SIMILAR CHANGES SPENCER HAS NOT SUFFERED IT WOULD BE SURPRISING
IF CHAUCER SHOULD SUFFER WHEN THE LOSS OF POPULAR
COMPREHENSION AND FAVOUR IN HIS CASE ARE NECESSARILY ALL THE
GREATER FOR HIS REMOTENESS FROM OUR DAY
IN A MUCH SMALLER
DEGREE SINCE PREVIOUS LABOURS IN THE SAME DIRECTION HAD LEFT
FAR LESS TO DO THE SAME WORK HAS BEEN PERFORMED FOR THE
SPELLING OF SPENSER AND THE WHOLE ENDEAVOUR IN THIS DEPARTMENT
OF THE EDITOR'S TASK HAS BEEN TO PRESENT A TEXT PLAIN AND EASILY
INTELLIGIBLE TO THE MODERN READER WITHOUT ANY INJUSTICE TO THE OLD
POET
IT WOULD BE PRESUMPTUOUS TO BELIEVE THAT IN EVERY CASE
BOTH ENDS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED TOGETHER BUT THE LAUDATORES
TEMPORIS ACTI THE STUDENTS WHO MAY DIFFER MOST FROM THE PLAN
PURSUED IN THIS VOLUME WILL BEST APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY OF
THE ENTERPRISE AND MOST LENIENTLY REGARD ANY FAILURE IN THE
DETAILS OF ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT
WITH ALL THE WORKS OF CHAUCER OUTSIDE THE CANTERBURY TALES IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITHIN THE SCOPE
OF THIS VOLUME
BUT NEARLY ONE HUNDRED PAGES HAVE BEEN
DEVOTED TO HIS MINOR POEMS AND BY DINT OF CAREFUL SELECTION
AND JUDICIOUS ABRIDGEMENT A CONNECTING OUTLINE OF THE STORY IN
ALL SUCH CASES BEING GIVEN THE EDITOR VENTURES TO HOPE THAT HE
HAS PRESENTED FAIR AND ACCEPTABLE SPECIMENS OF CHAUCER'S
WORKMANSHIP IN ALL STYLES
THE PREPARATION OF THIS PART OF THE
VOLUME HAS BEEN A LABORIOUS TASK NO SIMILAR ATTEMPT ON THE
SAME SCALE HAS BEEN MADE AND WHILE HERE ALSO THE TRUTH OF THE
TEXT IN MATTERS ESSENTIAL HAS BEEN IN NOWISE SACRIFICED TO MERE
EASE OF PERUSAL THE GENERAL READER WILL FIND OPENED UP FOR HIM A
NEW VIEW OF CHAUCER AND HIS WORKS
BEFORE A PERUSAL OF THESE
HUNDRED PAGES WILL MELT AWAY FOR EVER THE LINGERING TRADITION OR
PREJUDICE THAT CHAUCER WAS ONLY OR CHARACTERISTICALLY A COARSE
BUFFOON WHO PANDERED TO A BASE AND LICENTIOUS APPETITE BY
PAINTING AND EXAGGERATING THE LOWEST VICES OF HIS TIME
IN THESE
SELECTIONS MADE WITHOUT A THOUGHT OF TAKING ONLY WHAT IS TO
THE POET'S CREDIT FROM A WIDE RANGE OF POEMS IN WHICH HARDLY A
WORD IS TO HIS DISCREDIT WE BEHOLD CHAUCER AS HE WAS A
COURTIER A GALLANT PURE HEARTED GENTLEMAN A SCHOLAR A
PHILOSOPHER A POET OF GAY AND VIVID FANCY PLAYING AROUND
THEMES OF CHIVALRIC CONVENTION OF DEEP HUMAN INTEREST OR
BROAD SIGHTED SATIRE
IN THE CANTERBURY TALES WE SEE NOT
CHAUCER BUT CHAUCER'S TIMES AND NEIGHBOURS THE ARTIST HAS LOST
HIMSELF IN HIS WORK
TO SHOW HIM HONESTLY AND WITHOUT DISGUISE
AS HE LIVED HIS OWN LIFE AND SUNG HIS OWN SONGS AT THE BRILLIANT
COURT OF EDWARD III IS TO DO HIS MEMORY A MORAL JUSTICE FAR
MORE MATERIAL THAN ANY WRONG THAT CAN EVER COME OUT OF
SPELLING
AS TO THE MINOR POEMS OF SPENSER WHICH FOLLOW THE
FAERIE QUEEN THE CHOICE HAS BEEN GOVERNED BY THE DESIRE TO
GIVE AT ONCE THE MOST INTERESTING AND THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC OF
THE POET'S SEVERAL STYLES AND SAVE IN THE CASE OF THE SONNETS
THE POEMS SO SELECTED ARE GIVEN ENTIRE
IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE
ENDEAVOURS TO ADAPT THIS VOLUME FOR POPULAR USE HAVE BEEN
ALREADY NOTICED WOULD IMPERFECTLY SUCCEED WITHOUT THE AID OF
NOTES AND GLOSSARY TO EXPLAIN ALLUSIONS THAT HAVE BECOME
OBSOLETE OR ANTIQUATED WORDS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO RETAIN
AN ENDEAVOUR HAS BEEN MADE TO RENDER EACH PAGE SELF
EXPLANATORY BY PLACING ON IT ALL THE GLOSSARIAL AND ILLUSTRATIVE
NOTES REQUIRED FOR ITS ELUCIDATION OR TO AVOID REPETITIONS THAT
WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED SPACE THE REFERENCES TO THE SPOT WHERE
INFORMATION MAY BE FOUND
THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A PLAN
TO THE READER IS THE MEASURE OF ITS DIFFICULTY FOR THE EDITOR
IT
PERMITS MUCH MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE CHOICE OF GLOSSARIAL
EXPLANATIONS OR EQUIVALENTS IT SAVES THE DISTRACTING AND TIME
CONSUMING REFERENCE TO THE END OR THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT LARGELY ENHANCES THE LIABILITY TO ERROR
THE EDITOR IS CONSCIOUS THAT IN THE 12 000 OR 13 000 NOTES AS
WELL AS IN THE INNUMERABLE MINUTE POINTS OF SPELLING
ACCENTUATION AND RHYTHM HE MUST NOW AND AGAIN BE FOUND
TRIPPING HE CAN ONLY ASK ANY READER WHO MAY DETECT ALL THAT HE
COULD HIMSELF POINT OUT AS BEING AMISS TO SET OFF AGAINST
INEVITABLE MISTAKES AND MISJUDGEMENTS THE CONSCIENTIOUS LABOUR
BESTOWED ON THE BOOK AND THE BROAD CONSIDERATION OF ITS FITNESS
FOR THE OBJECT CONTEMPLATED
FROM BOOKS THE EDITOR HAS DERIVED VALUABLE HELP AS FROM MR
COWDEN CLARKE'S REVISED MODERN TEXT OF THE CANTERBURY TALES
PUBLISHED IN MR NIMMO'S LIBRARY EDITION OF THE ENGLISH POETS
FROM MR WRIGHT'S SCHOLARLY EDITION OF THE SAME WORK FROM THE
INDISPENSABLE TYRWHITT FROM MR BELL'S EDITION OF CHAUCER'S
POEM FROM PROFESSOR CRAIK'S SPENSER AND HIS POETRY
PUBLISHED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BY CHARLES KNIGHT AND FROM
MANY OTHERS
IN THE ABRIDGEMENT OF THE FAERIE QUEEN THE PLAN
MAY AT FIRST SIGHT SEEM TO BE MODELLED ON THE LINES OF MR CRAIK'S
PAINSTAKING CONDENSATION BUT THE COINCIDENCES ARE EITHER
INEVITABLE OR INVOLUNTARY
MANY OF THE NOTES ESPECIALLY OF THOSE
EXPLAINING CLASSICAL REFERENCES AND THOSE ATTACHED TO THE MINOR
POEMS OF CHAUCER HAVE BEEN PREPARED SPECIALLY FOR THIS EDITION
THE EDITOR LEAVES HIS TASK WITH THE HOPE THAT HIS ATTEMPT TO
REMOVE ARTIFICIAL OBSTACLES TO THE POPULARITY OF ENGLAND'S
EARLIEST POETS WILL NOT ALTOGETHER MISCARRY
D
LAING PURVES
LIFE OF GEOFFREY CHAUCER
NOT IN POINT OF GENIUS ONLY BUT EVEN IN POINT OF TIME CHAUCER
MAY CLAIM THE PROUD DESIGNATION OF FIRST ENGLISH POET
HE
WROTE THE COURT OF LOVE IN 1345 AND THE ROMAUNT OF THE
ROSE IF NOT ALSO TROILUS AND CRESSIDA PROBABLY WITHIN THE
NEXT DECADE THE DATES USUALLY ASSIGNED TO THE POEMS OF
LAURENCE MINOT EXTEND FROM 1335 TO 1355 WHILE THE VISION
OF PIERS PLOWMAN MENTIONS EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 1360 AND
1362 BEFORE WHICH DATE CHAUCER HAD CERTAINLY WRITTEN THE
ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS AND HIS DREAM BUT THOUGH THEY WERE
HIS CONTEMPORARIES NEITHER MINOT NOR LANGLAND IF LANGLAND
WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE VISION AT ALL APPROACHED CHAUCER IN THE
FINISH THE FORCE OR THE UNIVERSAL INTEREST OF THEIR WORKS AND THE
POEMS OF EARLIER WRITER AS LAYAMON AND THE AUTHOR OF THE
ORMULUM ARE LESS ENGLISH THAN ANGLO SAXON OR ANGLO
NORMAN
THOSE POEMS REFLECTED THE PERPLEXED STRUGGLE FOR
SUPREMACY BETWEEN THE TWO GRAND ELEMENTS OF OUR LANGUAGE
WHICH MARKED THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES A STRUGGLE
INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE POLITICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE
CONQUERING NORMANS AND THE SUBJUGATED ANGLO SAXONS
CHAUCER FOUND TWO BRANCHES OF THE LANGUAGE THAT SPOKEN BY
THE PEOPLE TEUTONIC IN ITS GENIUS AND ITS FORMS THAT SPOKEN BY
THE LEARNED AND THE NOBLE BASED ON THE FRENCH YET EACH BRANCH
HAD BEGUN TO BORROW OF THE OTHER JUST AS NOBLES AND PEOPLE
HAD BEEN TAUGHT TO RECOGNISE THAT EACH NEEDED THE OTHER IN THE
WARS AND THE SOCIAL TASKS OF THE TIME AND CHAUCER A SCHOLAR A
COURTIER A MAN CONVERSANT WITH ALL ORDERS OF SOCIETY BUT
ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK THINK AND WRITE IN THE WORDS OF THE
HIGHEST BY HIS COMPREHENSIVE GENIUS CAST INTO THE SIMMERING
MOULD A MAGICAL AMALGAMANT WHICH MADE THE TWO HALF HOSTILE
ELEMENTS UNITE AND INTERPENETRATE EACH OTHER
BEFORE CHAUCER
WROTE THERE WERE TWO TONGUES IN ENGLAND KEEPING ALIVE THE
FEUDS AND RESENTMENTS OF CRUEL CENTURIES WHEN HE LAID DOWN HIS
PEN THERE WAS PRACTICALLY BUT ONE SPEECH THERE WAS AND EVER
SINCE HAS BEEN BUT ONE PEOPLE
GEOFFREY CHAUCER ACCORDING TO THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY TRADITIONS
FOR AUTHENTIC TESTIMONIES ON THE SUBJECT ARE WANTING WAS BORN
IN 1328 AND LONDON IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN HIS
BIRTH PLACE
IT IS TRUE THAT LELAND THE BIOGRAPHER OF ENGLAND'S
FIRST GREAT POET WHO LIVED NEAREST TO HIS TIME NOT MERELY SPEAKS
OF CHAUCER AS HAVING BEEN BORN MANY YEARS LATER THAN THE DATE
NOW ASSIGNED BUT MENTIONS BERKSHIRE OR OXFORDSHIRE AS THE
SCENE OF HIS BIRTH
SO GREAT UNCERTAINTY HAVE SOME FELT ON THE
LATTER SCORE THAT ELABORATE PARALLELS HAVE BEEN DRAWN BETWEEN
CHAUCER AND HOMER FOR WHOSE BIRTHPLACE SEVERAL CITIES
CONTENDED AND WHOSE DESCENT WAS TRACED TO THE DEMIGODS
LELAND MAY SEEM TO HAVE HAD FAIR OPPORTUNITIES OF GETTING AT THE
TRUTH ABOUT CHAUCER'S BIRTH FOR HENRY VIII HAD HIM AT THE
SUPPRESSION OF THE MONASTERIES THROUGHOUT ENGLAND TO SEARCH
FOR RECORDS OF PUBLIC INTEREST THE ARCHIVES OF THE RELIGIOUS
HOUSES
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER HE WAS LIKELY TO FIND
MANY AUTHENTIC PARTICULARS REGARDING THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF THE
POET IN THE QUARTERS WHICH HE EXPLORED AND LELAND'S TESTIMONY
SEEMS TO BE SET ASIDE BY CHAUCER'S OWN EVIDENCE AS TO HIS
BIRTHPLACE AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY REFERENCES WHICH MAKE HIM
OUT AN AGED MAN FOR YEARS PRECEDING THE ACCEPTED DATE OF HIS
DEATH
IN ONE OF HIS PROSE WORKS THE TESTAMENT OF LOVE THE
POET SPEAKS OF HIMSELF IN TERMS THAT STRONGLY CONFIRM THE CLAIM
OF LONDON TO THE HONOUR OF GIVING HIM BIRTH FOR HE THERE
MENTIONS THE CITY OF LONDON THAT IS TO ME SO DEAR AND SWEET
IN WHICH I WAS FORTH GROWEN AND MORE KINDLY LOVE SAYS HE
HAVE I TO THAT PLACE THAN TO ANY OTHER IN EARTH AS EVERY KINDLY
CREATURE HATH FULL APPETITE TO THAT PLACE OF HIS KINDLY ENGENDRURE
AND TO WILL REST AND PEACE IN THAT PLACE TO ABIDE THIS TOLERABLY
DIRECT EVIDENCE IS SUPPORTED SO FAR AS IT CAN BE AT SUCH AN
INTERVAL OF TIME BY THE LEARNED CAMDEN IN HIS ANNALS OF
QUEEN ELIZABETH HE DESCRIBES SPENCER WHO WAS CERTAINLY BORN
IN LONDON AS BEING A FELLOW CITIZEN OF CHAUCER'S EDMUNDUS
SPENSERUS PATRIA LONDINENSIS MUSIS ADEO ARRIDENTIBUS NATUS UT
OMNES ANGLICOS SUPERIORIS AEVI POETAS NE CHAUCERO QUIDEM
CONCIVE EXCEPTO SUPERARET 1 THE RECORDS OF THE TIME NOTICE
MORE THAN ONE PERSON OF THE NAME OF CHAUCER WHO HELD
HONOURABLE POSITIONS ABOUT THE COURT AND THOUGH WE CANNOT
DISTINCTLY TRACE THE POET'S RELATIONSHIP WITH ANY OF THESE
NAMESAKES OR ANTECESSORS WE FIND EXCELLENT GROUND FOR BELIEF
THAT HIS FAMILY OR FRIENDS STOOD WELL AT COURT IN THE EASE WITH
WHICH CHAUCER MADE HIS WAY THERE AND IN HIS SUBSEQUENT
CAREER
LIKE HIS GREAT SUCCESSOR SPENCER IT WAS THE FORTUNE OF CHAUCER
TO LIVE UNDER A SPLENDID CHIVALROUS AND HIGH SPIRITED REIGN
1328 WAS THE SECOND YEAR OF EDWARD III AND WHAT WITH SCOTCH
WARS FRENCH EXPEDITIONS AND THE STRENUOUS AND COSTLY STRUGGLE
TO HOLD ENGLAND IN A WORTHY PLACE AMONG THE STATES OF EUROPE
THERE WAS SUFFICIENT BUSTLE BOLD ACHIEVEMENT AND HIGH AMBITION
IN THE PERIOD TO INSPIRE A POET WHO WAS PREPARED TO CATCH THE
SPIRIT OF THE DAY
IT WAS AN AGE OF ELABORATE COURTESY OF HIGH
PACED GALLANTRY OF COURAGEOUS VENTURE OF NOBLE DISDAIN FOR
MEAN TRANQUILLITY AND CHAUCER ON THE WHOLE A MAN OF PEACEFUL
AVOCATIONS WAS PENETRATED TO THE DEPTH OF HIS CONSCIOUSNESS
WITH THE LOFTY AND LOVELY CIVIL SIDE OF THAT BRILLIANT AND RESTLESS
MILITARY PERIOD
NO RECORD OF HIS YOUTHFUL YEARS HOWEVER
REMAINS TO US IF WE BELIEVE THAT AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN HE WAS A
STUDENT OF CAMBRIDGE IT IS ONLY ON THE STRENGTH OF A REFERENCE IN
HIS COURT OF LOVE WHERE THE NARRATOR IS MADE TO SAY THAT HIS
NAME IS PHILOGENET OF CAMBRIDGE CLERK WHILE HE HAD ALREADY
TOLD US THAT WHEN HE WAS STIRRED TO SEEK THE COURT OF CUPID HE
WAS AT EIGHTEEN YEAR OF AGE ACCORDING TO LELAND HOWEVER
HE WAS EDUCATED AT OXFORD PROCEEDING THENCE TO FRANCE AND
THE NETHERLANDS TO FINISH HIS STUDIES BUT THERE REMAINS NO
CERTAIN EVIDENCE OF HIS HAVING BELONGED TO EITHER UNIVERSITY
AT
THE SAME TIME IT IS NOT DOUBTED THAT HIS FAMILY WAS OF GOOD
CONDITION AND WHETHER OR NOT WE ACCEPT THE ASSERTION THAT HIS
FATHER HELD THE RANK OF KNIGHTHOOD REJECTING THE HYPOTHESES
THAT MAKE HIM A MERCHANT OR A VINTNER AT THE CORNER OF KIRTON
LANE IT IS PLAIN FROM CHAUCER'S WHOLE CAREER THAT HE HAD
INTRODUCTIONS TO PUBLIC LIFE AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO COURTLY
FAVOUR WHOLLY INDEPENDENT OF HIS GENIUS
WE HAVE THE CLEAREST
TESTIMONY THAT HIS MENTAL TRAINING WAS OF WIDE RANGE AND
THOROUGH EXCELLENCE ALTOGETHER RARE FOR A MERE COURTIER IN THOSE
DAYS HIS POEMS ATTEST HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE
DIVINITY THE PHILOSOPHY AND THE SCHOLARSHIP OF HIS TIME AND
SHOW HIM TO HAVE HAD THE SCIENCES AS THEN DEVELOPED AND
TAUGHT AT HIS FINGERS' ENDS ANOTHER PROOF OF CHAUCER'S GOOD
BIRTH AND FORTUNE WOULD HE FOUND IN THE STATEMENT THAT AFTER HIS
UNIVERSITY CAREER WAS COMPLETED HE ENTERED THE INNER TEMPLE
THE EXPENSES OF WHICH COULD BE BORNE ONLY BY MEN OF NOBLE
AND OPULENT FAMILIES BUT ALTHOUGH THERE IS A STORY THAT HE WAS
ONCE FINED TWO SHILLINGS FOR THRASHING A FRANCISCAN FRIAR IN FLEET
STREET WE HAVE NO DIRECT AUTHORITY FOR BELIEVING THAT THE POET
DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE UNCONGENIAL STUDY OF THE LAW
NO SPECIAL
DISPLAY OF KNOWLEDGE ON THAT SUBJECT APPEARS IN HIS WORKS YET
IN THE SKETCH OF THE MANCIPLE IN THE PROLOGUE TO THE CANTERBURY
TALES MAY BE FOUND INDICATIONS OF HIS FAMILIARITY WITH THE
INTERNAL ECONOMY OF THE INNS OF COURT WHILE NUMEROUS LEGAL
PHRASES AND REFERENCES HINT THAT HIS COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION
WAS NOT AT FAULT ON LEGAL MATTERS
LELAND SAYS THAT HE QUITTED THE
UNIVERSITY A READY LOGICIAN A SMOOTH RHETORICIAN A PLEASANT
POET A GRAVE PHILOSOPHER AN INGENIOUS MATHEMATICIAN AND A
HOLY DIVINE AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS WHEN GEOFFREY CHAUCER
COMES BEFORE US AUTHENTICALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE AGE OF
THIRTY ONE HE WAS POSSESSED OF KNOWLEDGE AND
ACCOMPLISHMENTS FAR BEYOND THE COMMON STANDARD OF HIS DAY
CHAUCER AT THIS PERIOD POSSESSED ALSO OTHER QUALITIES FITTED TO
RECOMMEND HIM TO FAVOUR IN A COURT LIKE THAT OF EDWARD III
URRY DESCRIBES HIM ON THE AUTHORITY OF A PORTRAIT AS BEING THEN
OF A FAIR BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION HIS LIPS RED AND FULL HIS SIZE OF A
JUST MEDIUM AND HIS PORT AND AIR GRACEFUL AND MAJESTIC
SO
CONTINUES THE ARDENT BIOGRAPHER SO THAT EVERY ORNAMENT THAT
COULD CLAIM THE APPROBATION OF THE GREAT AND FAIR HIS ABILITIES TO
RECORD THE VALOUR OF THE ONE AND CELEBRATE THE BEAUTY OF THE
OTHER AND HIS WIT AND GENTLE BEHAVIOUR TO CONVERSE WITH BOTH
CONSPIRED TO MAKE HIM A COMPLETE COURTIER IF WE BELIEVE THAT
HIS COURT OF LOVE HAD RECEIVED SUCH PUBLICITY AS THE LITERARY
MEDIA OF THE TIME ALLOWED IN THE SOMEWHAT NARROW AND SELECT
LITERARY WORLD NOT TO SPEAK OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA WHICH
AS LYDGATE MENTIONS IT FIRST AMONG CHAUCER'S WORKS SOME HAVE
SUPPOSED TO BE A YOUTHFUL PRODUCTION WE FIND A THIRD AND NOT
LESS POWERFUL RECOMMENDATION TO THE FAVOUR OF THE GREAT CO
OPERATING WITH HIS LEARNING AND HIS GALLANT BEARING
ELSEWHERE
2 REASONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN FOR DOUBT WHETHER TROILUS AND
CRESSIDA SHOULD NOT BE ASSIGNED TO A LATER PERIOD OF CHAUCER'S
LIFE BUT VERY LITTLE IS POSITIVELY KNOWN ABOUT THE DATES AND
SEQUENCE OF HIS VARIOUS WORKS
IN THE YEAR 1386 BEING CALLED AS
WITNESS WITH REGARD TO A CONTEST ON A POINT OF HERALDRY BETWEEN
LORD SCROPE AND SIR ROBERT GROSVENOR CHAUCER DEPOSED THAT
HE ENTERED ON HIS MILITARY CAREER IN 1359
IN THAT YEAR EDWARD
III INVADED FRANCE FOR THE THIRD TIME IN PURSUIT OF HIS CLAIM TO
THE FRENCH CROWN AND WE MAY FANCY THAT IN DESCRIBING THE
EMBARKATION OF THE KNIGHTS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM THE POET
GAINED SOME OF THE VIVIDNESS AND STIR OF HIS PICTURE FROM HIS
RECOLLECTIONS OF THE EMBARKATION OF THE SPLENDID AND WELL
APPOINTED ROYAL HOST AT SANDWICH ON BOARD THE ELEVEN HUNDRED
TRANSPORTS PROVIDED FOR THE ENTERPRISE
IN THIS EXPEDITION THE
LAURELS OF POITIERS WERE FLUNG ON THE GROUND AFTER VAINLY
ATTEMPTING RHEIMS AND PARIS EDWARD WAS CONSTRAINED BY CRUEL
WEATHER AND LACK OF PROVISIONS TO RETREAT TOWARD HIS SHIPS THE
FURY OF THE ELEMENTS MADE THE RETREAT MORE DISASTROUS THAN AN
OVERTHROW IN PITCHED BATTLE HORSES AND MEN PERISHED BY
THOUSANDS OR FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE PURSUING FRENCH
CHAUCER WHO HAD BEEN MADE PRISONER AT THE SIEGE OF RETTERS
WAS AMONG THE CAPTIVES IN THE POSSESSION OF FRANCE WHEN THE
TREATY OF BRETIGNY THE GREAT PEACE WAS CONCLUDED IN
MAY 1360
RETURNING TO ENGLAND AS WE MAY SUPPOSE AT THE
PEACE THE POET ERE LONG FELL INTO ANOTHER AND A PLEASANTER
CAPTIVITY FOR HIS MARRIAGE IS GENERALLY BELIEVED TO HAVE TAKEN
PLACE SHORTLY AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM FOREIGN DURANCE
HE HAD
ALREADY GAINED THE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP AND FAVOUR OF JOHN OF
GAUNT DUKE OF LANCASTER THE KING'S SON THE DUKE WHILE EARL
OF RICHMOND HAD COURTED AND WON TO WIFE AFTER A CERTAIN
DELAY BLANCHE DAUGHTER AND CO HEIRESS OF HENRY DUKE OF
LANCASTER AND CHAUCER IS BY SOME BELIEVED TO HAVE WRITTEN
THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS TO CELEBRATE THE WOOING AS HE WROTE
CHAUCER'S DREAM TO CELEBRATE THE WEDDING OF HIS PATRON
THE
MARRIAGE TOOK PLACE IN 1359 THE YEAR OF CHAUCER'S EXPEDITION TO
FRANCE AND AS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS THE FORMEL OR
FEMALE EAGLE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE LADY BLANCHE
BEGS THAT HER CHOICE OF A MATE MAY BE DEFERRED FOR A YEAR 1358
AND 1359 HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED AS THE RESPECTIVE DATES OF THE TWO
POEMS ALREADY MENTIONED
IN THE DREAM CHAUCER
PROMINENTLY INTRODUCES HIS OWN LADY LOVE TO WHOM AFTER THE
HAPPY UNION OF HIS PATRON WITH THE LADY BLANCHE HE IS WEDDED
AMID GREAT REJOICING AND VARIOUS EXPRESSIONS IN THE SAME POEM
SHOW THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE POET HIGH IN FAVOUR WITH THE
ILLUSTRIOUS PAIR BUT THAT HIS FUTURE WIFE HAD ALSO PECULIAR CLAIMS
ON THEIR REGARD
SHE WAS THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER OF SIR PAYNE
ROET A NATIVE OF HAINAULT WHO HAD LIKE MANY OF HIS
COUNTRYMEN BEEN ATTRACTED TO ENGLAND BY THE EXAMPLE AND
PATRONAGE OF QUEEN PHILIPPA
THE FAVOURITE ATTENDANT ON THE
LADY BLANCHE WAS HER ELDER SISTER KATHERINE SUBSEQUENTLY
MARRIED TO SIR HUGH SWYNFORD A GENTLEMAN OF LINCOLNSHIRE
AND DESTINED AFTER THE DEATH OF BLANCHE TO BE IN SUCCESSION
GOVERNESS OF HER CHILDREN MISTRESS OF JOHN OF GAUNT AND
LAWFULLY WEDDED DUCHESS OF LANCASTER
IT IS QUITE SUFFICIENT
PROOF THAT CHAUCER'S POSITION AT COURT WAS OF NO MEAN
CONSEQUENCE TO FIND THAT HIS WIFE THE SISTER OF THE FUTURE
DUCHESS OF LANCASTER WAS ONE OF THE ROYAL MAIDS OF HONOUR
AND EVEN AS SIR HARRIS NICOLAS CONJECTURES A GOD DAUGHTER OF
THE QUEEN FOR HER NAME ALSO WAS PHILIPPA
BETWEEN 1359 WHEN THE POET HIMSELF TESTIFIES THAT HE WAS MADE
PRISONER WHILE BEARING ARMS IN FRANCE AND SEPTEMBER 1366
WHEN QUEEN PHILIPPA GRANTED TO HER FORMER MAID OF HONOUR BY
THE NAME OF PHILIPPA CHAUCER A YEARLY PENSION OF TEN MARKS OR
L6 13S
4D WE HAVE NO AUTHENTIC MENTION OF CHAUCER EXPRESS
OR INDIRECT
IT IS PLAIN FROM THIS GRANT THAT THE POET'S MARRIAGE
WITH SIR PAYNE ROET'S DAUGHTER WAS NOT CELEBRATED LATER THAN
1366 THE PROBABILITY IS THAT IT CLOSELY FOLLOWED HIS RETURN FROM
THE WARS
IN 1367 EDWARD III
SETTLED UPON CHAUCER A LIFE
PENSION OF TWENTY MARKS FOR THE GOOD SERVICE WHICH OUR
BELOVED VALET 'DILECTUS VALETTUS NOSTER' GEOFFREY CHAUCER
HAS RENDERED AND WILL RENDER IN TIME TO COME CAMDEN
EXPLAINS 'VALETTUS HOSPITII' TO SIGNIFY A GENTLEMAN OF THE PRIVY
CHAMBER SELDEN SAYS THAT THE DESIGNATION WAS BESTOWED UPON
YOUNG HEIRS DESIGNED TO HE KNIGHTED OR YOUNG GENTLEMEN OF
GREAT DESCENT AND QUALITY WHATEVER THE STRICT MEANING OF THE
WORD IT IS PLAIN THAT THE POET'S POSITION WAS HONOURABLE AND
NEAR TO THE KING'S PERSON AND ALSO THAT HIS WORLDLY
CIRCUMSTANCES WERE EASY IF NOT AFFLUENT FOR IT NEED NOT BE SAID
THAT TWENTY MARKS IN THOSE DAYS REPRESENTED TWELVE OR TWENTY
TIMES THE SUM IN THESE
IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE FOUND POWERFUL
PATRONAGE NOT MERELY FROM THE DUKE OF LANCASTER AND HIS WIFE
BUT FROM MARGARET COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE THE KING'S DAUGHTER
TO HER CHAUCER IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ADDRESSED THE GOODLY
BALLAD IN WHICH THE LADY IS CELEBRATED UNDER THE IMAGE OF THE
DAISY HER HE IS BY SOME UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE REPRESENTED UNDER
THE TITLE OF QUEEN ALCESTIS IN THE COURT OF LOVE AND THE
PROLOGUE TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN AND IN HER PRAISE
WE MAY READ HIS CHARMING DESCRIPTIONS AND EULOGIES OF THE DAISY
FRENCH MARGUERITE THE NAME OF HIS ROYAL PATRONESS
TO
THIS PERIOD OF CHAUCER'S CAREER WE MAY PROBABLY ATTRIBUTE THE
ELEGANT AND COURTLY IF SOMEWHAT CONVENTIONAL POEMS OF THE
FLOWER AND THE LEAF THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE C
THE LADY MARGARET SAYS URRY
WOULD FREQUENTLY
COMPLIMENT HIM UPON HIS POEMS
BUT THIS IS NOT TO BE MEANT OF
HIS CANTERBURY TALES THEY BEING WRITTEN IN THE LATTER PART OF HIS
LIFE WHEN THE COURTIER AND THE FINE GENTLEMAN GAVE WAY TO SOLID
SENSE AND PLAIN DESCRIPTIONS
IN HIS LOVE PIECES HE WAS OBLIGED
TO HAVE THE STRICTEST REGARD TO MODESTY AND DECENCY THE LADIES
AT THAT TIME INSISTING SO MUCH UPON THE NICEST PUNCTILIOS OF
HONOUR THAT IT WAS HIGHLY CRIMINAL TO DEPRECIATE THEIR SEX OR DO
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT OFFEND VIRTUE CHAUCER IN THEIR ESTIMATION
HAD SINNED AGAINST THE DIGNITY AND HONOUR OF WOMANKIND BY HIS
TRANSLATION OF THE FRENCH ROMAN DE LA ROSE AND BY HIS
TROILUS AND CRESSIDA ASSUMING IT TO HAVE BEEN AMONG HIS
LESS MATURE WORKS AND TO ATONE FOR THOSE OFFENCES THE LADY
MARGARET THOUGH OTHER AND OLDER ACCOUNTS SAY THAT IT WAS THE
FIRST QUEEN OF RICHARD II ANNE OF BOHEMIA PRESCRIBED TO HIM
THE TASK OF WRITING THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN SEE
INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THAT POEM
ABOUT THIS PERIOD TOO WE
MAY PLACE THE COMPOSITION OF CHAUCER'S A
B
C OR THE PRAYER
OF OUR LADY MADE AT THE REQUEST OF THE DUCHESS BLANCHE A
LADY OF GREAT DEVOUTNESS IN HER PRIVATE LIFE
SHE DIED IN 1369
AND CHAUCER AS HE HAD ALLEGORISED HER WOOING CELEBRATED HER
MARRIAGE AND AIDED HER DEVOTIONS NOW LAMENTED HER DEATH IN A
POEM ENTITLED THE BOOK OF THE DUCHESS OR THE DEATH OF
BLANCHE 3
IN 1370 CHAUCER WAS EMPLOYED ON THE KING'S SERVICE ABROAD
AND IN NOVEMBER 1372 BY THE TITLE OF SCUTIFER NOSTER OUR
ESQUIRE OR SHIELD BEARER HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH JACOBUS
PRONAN AND JOHANNES DE MARI CIVIS JANUENSIS IN A ROYAL
COMMISSION BESTOWING FULL POWERS TO TREAT WITH THE DUKE OF
GENOA HIS COUNCIL AND STATE
THE OBJECT OF THE EMBASSY WAS
TO NEGOTIATE UPON THE CHOICE OF AN ENGLISH PORT AT WHICH THE
GENOESE MIGHT FORM A COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENT AND CHAUCER
HAVING QUITTED ENGLAND IN DECEMBER VISITED GENOA AND
FLORENCE AND RETURNED TO ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF NOVEMBER
1373 FOR ON THAT DAY HE DREW HIS PENSION FROM THE EXCHEQUER
IN PERSON
THE MOST INTERESTING POINT CONNECTED WITH THIS ITALIAN
MISSION IS THE QUESTION WHETHER CHAUCER VISITED PETRARCH AT
PADUA
THAT HE DID IS UNHESITATINGLY AFFIRMED BY THE OLD
BIOGRAPHERS BUT THE AUTHENTIC NOTICES OF CHAUCER DURING THE
YEARS 1372 1373 AS SHOWN BY THE RESEARCHES OF SIR HARRIS
NICOLAS ARE CONFINED TO THE FACTS ALREADY STATED AND WE ARE LEFT
TO ANSWER THE QUESTION BY THE PROBABILITIES OF THE CASE AND BY
THE AID OF WHAT FAINT LIGHT THE POET HIMSELF AFFORDS
WE CAN
SCARCELY FANCY THAT CHAUCER VISITING ITALY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A
CAPACITY WHICH OPENED FOR HIM EASY ACCESS TO THE GREAT AND THE
FAMOUS DID NOT EMBRACE THE CHANCE OF MEETING A POET WHOSE
WORKS HE EVIDENTLY KNEW IN THEIR NATIVE TONGUE AND HIGHLY
ESTEEMED
WITH MR WRIGHT WE ARE STRONGLY DISINCLINED TO
BELIEVE THAT CHAUCER DID NOT PROFIT BY THE OPPORTUNITY
OF
IMPROVING HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE POETRY IF NOT THE POETS OF
THE COUNTRY HE THUS VISITED WHOSE INFLUENCE WAS NOW BEING FELT
ON THE LITERATURE OF MOST COUNTRIES OF WESTERN EUROPE THAT
CHAUCER WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE ITALIAN LANGUAGE APPEARS NOT
MERELY FROM HIS REPEATED SELECTION AS ENVOY TO ITALIAN STATES
BUT BY MANY PASSAGES IN HIS POETRY FROM THE ASSEMBLY OF
FOWLS TO THE CANTERBURY TALES IN THE OPENING OF THE FIRST
POEM THERE IS A STRIKING PARALLEL TO DANTE'S INSCRIPTION ON THE
GATE OF HELL
THE FIRST SONG OF TROILUS IN TROILUS AND
CRESSIDA IS A NEARLY LITERAL TRANSLATION OF PETRARCH'S 88TH
SONNET
IN THE PROLOGUE TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN
THERE IS A REFERENCE TO DANTE WHICH CAN HARDLY HAVE REACHED THE
POET AT SECOND HAND
AND IN CHAUCER'S GREAT WORK AS IN THE
WIFE OF BATH'S TALE AND THE MONK'S TALE DIRECT REFERENCE BY
NAME IS MADE TO DANTE THE WISE POET OF FLORENCE THE GREAT
POET OF ITALY AS THE SOURCE WHENCE THE AUTHOR HAS QUOTED
WHEN WE CONSIDER THE POET'S HIGH PLACE IN LITERATURE AND AT
COURT WHICH COULD NOT FAIL TO MAKE HIM FREE OF THE HOSPITALITIES
OF THE BRILLIANT LITTLE LOMBARD STATES HIS FAMILIARITY WITH THE
TONGUE AND THE WORKS OF ITALY'S GREATEST BARDS DEAD AND LIVING
THE REVERENTIAL REGARD WHICH HE PAID TO THE MEMORY OF GREAT
POETS OF WHICH WE HAVE EXAMPLES IN THE HOUSE OF FAME AND
AT THE CLOSE OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA 4 ALONG WITH HIS OWN
TESTIMONY IN THE PROLOGUE TO THE CLERK'S TALE WE CANNOT FAIL TO
CONSTRUE THAT TESTIMONY AS A DECLARATION THAT THE TALE WAS
ACTUALLY TOLD TO CHAUCER BY THE LIPS OF PETRARCH IN 1373 THE
VERY YEAR IN WHICH PETRARCH TRANSLATED IT INTO LATIN FROM
BOCCACCIO'S DECAMERON 5 MR BELL NOTES THE OBJECTION TO
THIS INTERPRETATION THAT THE WORDS ARE PUT INTO THE MOUTH NOT OF
THE POET BUT OF THE CLERK AND MEETS IT BY THE COUNTER
OBJECTION THAT THE CLERK BEING A PURELY IMAGINARY PERSONAGE
COULD NOT HAVE LEARNED THE STORY AT PADUA FROM PETRARCH AND
THEREFORE THAT CHAUCER MUST HAVE DEPARTED FROM THE DRAMATIC
ASSUMPTION MAINTAINED IN THE REST OF THE DIALOGUE
INSTANCES
COULD BE ADDUCED FROM CHAUCER'S WRITINGS TO SHOW THAT SUCH A
SUDDEN DEPARTURE FROM THE DRAMATIC ASSUMPTION WOULD NOT BE
UNEXAMPLED WITNESS THE ASIDE IN THE WIFE OF BATH'S
PROLOGUE WHERE AFTER THE JOLLY DAME HAS ASSERTED THAT HALF SO
BOLDLY THERE CAN NO MAN SWEAR AND LIE AS A WOMAN CAN THE
POET HASTENS TO INTERPOSE IN HIS OWN PERSON THESE TWO LINES
I SAY NOT THIS BY WIVES THAT BE WISE
BUT IF IT BE WHEN THEY THEM MISADVISE
AND AGAIN IN THE PROLOGUE TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN
FROM A DESCRIPTION OF THE DAISY
SHE IS THE CLEARNESS AND THE VERY LIGHT
THAT IN THIS DARKE WORLD ME GUIDES AND LEADS
THE POET IN THE VERY NEXT LINES SLIDES INTO AN ADDRESS TO HIS LADY
THE HEART WITHIN MY SORROWFUL HEART YOU DREADS
AND LOVES SO SORE THAT YE BE VERILY
THE MISTRESS OF MY WIT AND NOTHING I C
WHEN THEREFORE THE CLERK OF OXFORD IS MADE TO SAY THAT HE WILL
TELL A TALE
THE WHICH THAT I
LEARN'D AT PADOVA OF A WORTHY CLERK
AS PROVED BY HIS WORDES AND HIS WERK
HE IS NOW DEAD AND NAILED IN HIS CHEST
I PRAY TO GOD TO GIVE HIS SOUL GOOD REST
FRANCIS PETRARC' THE LAUREATE POETE
HIGHTE THIS CLERK WHOSE RHETORIC SO SWEET
ILLUMIN'D ALL ITAILE OF POETRY
BUT FORTH TO TELLEN OF THIS WORTHY MAN
THAT TAUGHTE ME THIS TALE AS I BEGAN
WE MAY WITHOUT VIOLENT EFFORT BELIEVE THAT CHAUCER SPEAKS IN HIS
OWN PERSON THOUGH DRAMATICALLY THE WORDS ARE ON THE CLERK'S
LIPS
AND THE BELIEF IS NOT IMPAIRED BY THE SORROWFUL WAY IN
WHICH THE CLERK LINGERS ON PETRARCH'S DEATH WHICH WOULD BE
LESS INTELLIGIBLE IF THE FICTITIOUS NARRATOR HAD ONLY READ THE STORY
IN THE LATIN TRANSLATION THAN IF WE SUPPOSE THE NEWS OF
PETRARCH'S DEATH AT ARQUA IN JULY 1374 TO HAVE CLOSELY FOLLOWED
CHAUCER TO ENGLAND AND TO HAVE CRUELLY AND IRRESISTIBLY MINGLED
ITSELF WITH OUR POET'S PERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF HIS GREAT ITALIAN
CONTEMPORARY
NOR MUST WE REGARD AS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE THE
MANNER IN WHICH THE CLERK IS MADE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE
BODY OF PETRARCH'S TALE AND THE FASHION IN WHICH IT WAS SET
FORTH IN WRITING WITH A PROEM THAT SEEMED A THING
IMPERTINENT SAVE THAT THE POET HAD CHOSEN IN THAT WAY TO
CONVEY HIS MATTER TOLD OR TAUGHT SO MUCH MORE DIRECTLY
AND SIMPLY BY WORD OF MOUTH
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PRONOUNCE
POSITIVELY ON THE SUBJECT THE QUESTION WHETHER CHAUCER SAW
PETRARCH IN 1373 MUST REMAIN A MOOT POINT SO LONG AS WE HAVE
ONLY OUR PRESENT INFORMATION BUT FANCY LOVES TO DWELL ON THE
THOUGHT OF THE TWO POETS CONVERSING UNDER THE VINES AT ARQUA
AND WE FIND IN THE HISTORY AND THE WRITINGS OF CHAUCER NOTHING
TO CONTRADICT A GOOD DEAL TO COUNTENANCE THE BELIEF THAT SUCH A
MEETING OCCURRED
THOUGH WE HAVE NO EXPRESS RECORD WE HAVE INDIRECT TESTIMONY
THAT CHAUCER'S GENOESE MISSION WAS DISCHARGED SATISFACTORILY
FOR ON THE 23D OF APRIL 1374 EDWARD III GRANTS AT WINDSOR TO
THE POET BY THE TITLE OF OUR BELOVED SQUIRE DILECTO ARMIGERO
NOSTRO UNUM PYCHER
VINI ONE PITCHER OF WINE DAILY TO BE
PERCEIVED IN THE PORT OF LONDON A GRANT WHICH ON THE
ANALOGY OF MORE MODERN USAGE MIGHT HE HELD EQUIVALENT TO
CHAUCER'S APPOINTMENT AS POET LAUREATE
WHEN WE FIND THAT
SOON AFTERWARDS THE GRANT WAS COMMUTED FOR A MONEY PAYMENT
OF TWENTY MARKS PER ANNUM WE NEED NOT CONCLUDE THAT
CHAUCER'S CIRCUMSTANCES WERE POOR FOR IT MAY BE EASILY
SUPPOSED THAT THE DAILY PERCEPTION OF SUCH AN ARTICLE OF
INCOME WAS ATTENDED WITH CONSIDERABLE PROSAIC INCONVENIENCE
A PERMANENT PROVISION FOR CHAUCER WAS MADE ON THE 8TH OF
JUNE 1374 WHEN HE WAS APPOINTED CONTROLLER OF THE CUSTOMS IN
THE PORT OF LONDON FOR THE LUCRATIVE IMPORTS OF WOOLS SKINS OR
WOOL FELLS AND TANNED HIDES ON CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD
FULFIL THE DUTIES OF THAT OFFICE IN PERSON AND NOT BY DEPUTY AND
SHOULD WRITE OUT THE ACCOUNTS WITH HIS OWN HAND
WE HAVE
WHAT SEEMS EVIDENCE OF CHAUCER'S COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TERMS
IN THE HOUSE OF FAME WHERE IN THE MOUTH OF THE EAGLE THE
POET DESCRIBES HIMSELF WHEN HE HAS FINISHED HIS LABOUR AND
MADE HIS RECKONINGS AS NOT SEEKING REST AND NEWS IN SOCIAL
INTERCOURSE BUT GOING HOME TO HIS OWN HOUSE AND THERE ALL SO
DUMB AS ANY STONE SITTING AT ANOTHER BOOK UNTIL HIS LOOK IS
DAZED AND AGAIN IN THE RECORD THAT IN 1376 HE RECEIVED A GRANT
OF L731 4S
6D THE AMOUNT OF A FINE LEVIED ON ONE JOHN KENT
WHOM CHAUCER'S VIGILANCE HAD FRUSTRATED IN THE ATTEMPT TO SHIP A
QUANTITY OF WOOL FOR DORDRECHT WITHOUT PAYING THE DUTY
THE
SEEMINGLY DEROGATORY CONDITION THAT THE CONTROLLER SHOULD
WRITE OUT THE ACCOUNTS OR ROLLS ROTULOS OF HIS OFFICE WITH HIS
OWN HAND APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED OR TREATED AS MERELY
FORMAL NO RECORDS IN CHAUCER'S HANDWRITING ARE KNOWN TO EXIST
WHICH COULD HARDLY BE THE CASE IF FOR THE TWELVE YEARS OF HIS
CONTROLLERSHIP 1374 1386 HE HAD DULY COMPLIED WITH THE
CONDITION AND DURING THAT PERIOD HE WAS MORE THAN ONCE
EMPLOYED ABROAD SO THAT THE CONDITION WAS EVIDENTLY REGARDED
AS A FORMALITY EVEN BY THOSE WHO HAD IMPOSED IT
ALSO IN 1374
THE DUKE OF LANCASTER WHOSE AMBITIOUS VIEWS MAY WELL HAVE
MADE HIM ANXIOUS TO RETAIN THE ADHESION OF A MAN SO CAPABLE
AND ACCOMPLISHED AS CHAUCER CHANGED INTO A JOINT LIFE ANNUITY
REMAINING TO THE SURVIVOR AND CHARGED ON THE REVENUES OF THE
SAVOY A PENSION OF L10 WHICH TWO YEARS BEFORE HE SETTLED ON
THE POET'S WIFE WHOSE SISTER WAS THEN THE GOVERNESS OF THE
DUKE'S TWO DAUGHTERS PHILIPPA AND ELIZABETH AND THE DUKE'S
OWN MISTRESS
ANOTHER PROOF OF CHAUCER'S PERSONAL REPUTATION
AND HIGH COURT FAVOUR AT THIS TIME IS HIS SELECTION 1375 AS
WARD TO THE SON OF SIR EDMOND STAPLEGATE OF BILSYNTON IN KENT
A CHARGE ON THE SURRENDER OF WHICH THE GUARDIAN RECEIVED NO
LESS A SUM THAN L104
WE FIND CHAUCER IN 1376 AGAIN EMPLOYED ON A FOREIGN MISSION
IN 1377 THE LAST YEAR OF EDWARD III HE WAS SENT TO FLANDERS
WITH SIR THOMAS PERCY AFTERWARDS EARL OF WORCESTER FOR THE
PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A PROLONGATION OF THE TRUCE AND IN JANUARY
13738 HE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIR GUICHARD D'ANGLE AND OTHER
COMMISSIONERS TO PURSUE CERTAIN NEGOTIATIONS FOR A MARRIAGE
BETWEEN PRINCESS MARY OF FRANCE AND THE YOUNG KING RICHARD
II WHICH HAD BEEN SET ON FOOT BEFORE THE DEATH OF EDWARD III
THE NEGOTIATION HOWEVER PROVED FRUITLESS AND IN MAY 1378
CHAUCER WAS SELECTED TO ACCOMPANY SIR JOHN BERKELEY ON A
MISSION TO THE COURT OF BERNARDO VISCONTI DUKE OF MILAN WITH
THE VIEW IT IS SUPPOSED OF CONCERTING MILITARY PLANS AGAINST THE
OUTBREAK OF WAR WITH FRANCE
THE NEW KING MEANTIME HAD
SHOWN THAT HE WAS NOT INSENSIBLE TO CHAUCER'S MERIT OR TO THE
INFLUENCE OF HIS TUTOR AND THE POET'S PATRON THE DUKE OF
LANCASTER FOR RICHARD II
CONFIRMED TO CHAUCER HIS PENSION OF
TWENTY MARKS ALONG WITH AN EQUAL ANNUAL SUM FOR WHICH THE
DAILY PITCHER OF WINE GRANTED IN 1374 HAD BEEN COMMUTED
BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE FOR LOMBARDY CHAUCER STILL HOLDING HIS
POST IN THE CUSTOMS SELECTED TWO REPRESENTATIVES OR TRUSTEES
TO PROTECT HIS ESTATE AGAINST LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN HIS ABSENCE OR
TO SUE IN HIS NAME DEFAULTERS AND OFFENDERS AGAINST THE IMPOSTS
WHICH HE WAS CHARGED TO ENFORCE
ONE OF THESE TRUSTEES WAS
CALLED RICHARD FORRESTER THE OTHER WAS JOHN GOWER THE POET
THE MOST FAMOUS ENGLISH CONTEMPORARY OF CHAUCER WITH WHOM
HE HAD FOR MANY YEARS BEEN ON TERMS OF ADMIRING FRIENDSHIP
ALTHOUGH FROM THE STRICTURES PASSED ON CERTAIN PRODUCTIONS OF
GOWER'S IN THE PROLOGUE TO THE MAN OF LAW'S TALE 6 IT HAS
BEEN SUPPOSED THAT IN THE LATER YEARS OF CHAUCER'S LIFE THE
FRIENDSHIP SUFFERED SOME DIMINUTION
TO THE MORAL GOWER AND
THE PHILOSOPHICAL STRODE CHAUCER DIRECTED OR DEDICATED HIS
TROILUS AND CRESSIDA 7 WHILE IN THE CONFESSIO AMANTIS
GOWER INTRODUCES A HANDSOME COMPLIMENT TO HIS GREATER
CONTEMPORARY AS THE DISCIPLE AND THE POET OF VENUS WITH
WHOSE GLAD SONGS AND DITTIES MADE IN HER PRAISE DURING THE
FLOWERS OF HIS YOUTH THE LAND WAS FILLED EVERYWHERE
GOWER
HOWEVER A MONK AND A CONSERVATIVE HELD TO THE PARTY OF
THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER THE RIVAL OF THE WYCLIFFITE AND
INNOVATING DUKE OF LANCASTER WHO WAS CHAUCER'S PATRON AND
WHOSE CAUSE WAS NOT A LITTLE AIDED BY CHAUCER'S STRICTURES ON THE
CLERGY AND THUS IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT POLITICAL DIFFERENCES
MAY HAVE WEAKENED THE OLD BONDS OF PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP AND
POETIC ESTEEM
RETURNING FROM LOMBARDY EARLY IN 1379
CHAUCER SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AGAIN SENT ABROAD FOR THE RECORDS
EXHIBIT NO TRACE OF HIM BETWEEN MAY AND DECEMBER OF THAT
YEAR
WHETHER BY PROXY OR IN PERSON HOWEVER HE RECEIVED HIS
PENSIONS REGULARLY UNTIL 1382 WHEN HIS INCOME WAS INCREASED
BY HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE POST OF CONTROLLER OF PETTY CUSTOMS
IN THE PORT OF LONDON
IN NOVEMBER 1384 HE OBTAINED A
MONTH'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE ON ACCOUNT OF HIS PRIVATE AFFAIRS AND A
DEPUTY WAS APPOINTED TO FILL HIS PLACE AND IN FEBRUARY OF THE
NEXT YEAR HE WAS PERMITTED TO APPOINT A PERMANENT DEPUTY
THUS AT LENGTH GAINING RELIEF FROM THAT CLOSE ATTENTION TO BUSINESS
WHICH PROBABLY CURTAILED THE POETIC FRUITS OF THE POET'S MOST
POWERFUL YEARS
8
CHAUCER IS NEXT FOUND OCCUPYING A POST WHICH HAS NOT OFTEN
BEEN HELD BY MEN GIFTED WITH HIS PECULIAR GENIUS THAT OF A
COUNTY MEMBER
THE CONTEST BETWEEN THE DUKES OF GLOUCESTER
AND LANCASTER AND THEIR ADHERENTS FOR THE CONTROL OF THE
GOVERNMENT WAS COMING TO A CRISIS AND WHEN THE RECLUSE AND
STUDIOUS CHAUCER WAS INDUCED TO OFFER HIMSELF TO THE ELECTORS OF
KENT AS ONE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THEIR SHIRE WHERE PRESUMABLY HE
HELD PROPERTY WE MAY SUPPOSE THAT IT WAS WITH THE VIEW OF
SUPPORTING HIS PATRON'S CAUSE IN THE IMPENDING CONFLICT
THE
PARLIAMENT IN WHICH THE POET SAT ASSEMBLED AT WESTMINSTER ON
THE 1ST OF OCTOBER AND WAS DISSOLVED ON THE 1ST OF NOVEMBER
1386
LANCASTER WAS FIGHTING AND INTRIGUING ABROAD ABSORBED IN
THE AFFAIRS OF HIS CASTILIAN SUCCESSION GLOUCESTER AND HIS FRIENDS
AT HOME HAD EVERYTHING THEIR OWN WAY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK WAS
DISMISSED FROM THE WOOLSACK AND IMPEACHED BY THE COMMONS
AND ALTHOUGH RICHARD AT FIRST STOOD OUT COURAGEOUSLY FOR THE
FRIENDS OF HIS UNCLE LANCASTER HE WAS CONSTRAINED BY THE REFUSAL
OF SUPPLIES TO CONSENT TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF GLOUCESTER
A
COMMISSION WAS WRUNG FROM HIM UNDER PROTEST APPOINTING
GLOUCESTER ARUNDEL AND TWELVE OTHER PEERS AND PRELATES A
PERMANENT COUNCIL TO INQUIRE INTO THE CONDITION OF ALL THE PUBLIC
DEPARTMENTS THE COURTS OF LAW AND THE ROYAL HOUSEHOLD WITH
ABSOLUTE POWERS OF REDRESS AND DISMISSAL
WE NEED NOT ASCRIBE
TO CHAUCER'S PARLIAMENTARY EXERTIONS IN HIS PATRON'S BEHALF NOR
TO ANY MALPRACTICES IN HIS OFFICIAL CONDUCT THE FACT THAT HE WAS
AMONG THE EARLIEST VICTIMS OF THE COMMISSION 9 IN DECEMBER
1386 HE WAS DISMISSED FROM BOTH HIS OFFICES IN THE PORT OF
LONDON BUT HE RETAINED HIS PENSIONS AND DREW THEM REGULARLY
TWICE A YEAR AT THE EXCHEQUER UNTIL 1388
IN 1387 CHAUCER'S
POLITICAL REVERSES WERE AGGRAVATED BY A SEVERE DOMESTIC
CALAMITY HIS WIFE DIED AND WITH HER DIED THE PENSION WHICH HAD
BEEN SETTLED ON HER BY QUEEN PHILIPPA IN 1366 AND CONFIRMED TO
HER AT RICHARD'S ACCESSION IN 1377
THE CHANGE MADE IN
CHAUCER'S PECUNIARY POSITION BY THE LOSS OF HIS OFFICES AND HIS
WIFE'S PENSION MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT
DURING HIS PROSPEROUS TIMES HE HAD LIVED IN A STYLE QUITE EQUAL TO
HIS INCOME AND HAD NO AMPLE RESOURCES AGAINST A SEASON OF
REVERSE FOR ON THE 1ST OF MAY 1388 LESS THAN A YEAR AND A HALF
AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE CUSTOMS HE WAS CONSTRAINED TO
ASSIGN HIS PENSIONS BY SURRENDER IN CHANCERY TO ONE JOHN
SCALBY
IN MAY 1389 RICHARD II NOW OF AGE ABRUPTLY
RESUMED THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT WHICH FOR MORE THAN TWO
YEARS HAD BEEN ABLY BUT CRUELLY MANAGED BY GLOUCESTER
THE
FRIENDS OF LANCASTER WERE ONCE MORE SUPREME IN THE ROYAL
COUNCILS AND CHAUCER SPEEDILY PROFITED BY THE CHANGE
ON THE
12TH OF JULY HE WAS APPOINTED CLERK OF THE KING'S WORKS AT THE
PALACE OF WESTMINSTER THE TOWER THE ROYAL MANORS OF
KENNINGTON ELTHAM CLARENDON SHEEN BYFLEET CHILDERN
LANGLEY AND FECKENHAM THE CASTLE OF BERKHAMSTEAD THE ROYAL
LODGE OF HATHENBURGH IN THE NEW FOREST THE LODGES IN THE
PARKS OF CLARENDON CHILDERN LANGLEY AND FECKENHAM AND THE
MEWS FOR THE KING'S FALCONS AT CHARING CROSS HE RECEIVED A
SALARY OF TWO SHILLINGS PER DAY AND WAS ALLOWED TO PERFORM THE
DUTIES BY DEPUTY
FOR SOME REASON UNKNOWN CHAUCER HELD THIS
LUCRATIVE OFFICE 10 LITTLE MORE THAN TWO YEARS QUITTING IT
BEFORE THE 16TH OF SEPTEMBER 1391 AT WHICH DATE IT HAD PASSED
INTO THE HANDS OF ONE JOHN GEDNEY
THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND A
HALF ARE A BLANK SO FAR AS AUTHENTIC RECORDS ARE CONCERNED
CHAUCER IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE PASSED THEM IN RETIREMENT
PROBABLY DEVOTING THEM PRINCIPALLY TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE
CANTERBURY TALES
IN FEBRUARY 1394 THE KING CONFERRED UPON
HIM A GRANT OF L20 A YEAR FOR LIFE BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD NO
OTHER SOURCE OF INCOME AND TO HAVE BECOME EMBARRASSED BY
DEBT FOR FREQUENT MEMORANDA OF SMALL ADVANCES ON HIS PENSION
SHOW THAT HIS CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IN COMPARISON GREATLY
REDUCED
THINGS APPEAR TO HAVE GROWN WORSE AND WORSE WITH
THE POET FOR IN MAY 1398 HE WAS COMPELLED TO OBTAIN FROM THE
KING LETTERS OF PROTECTION AGAINST ARREST EXTENDING OVER A TERM
OF TWO YEARS
NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME IT IS TRUE FOR SIMILAR
DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN ISSUED AT THE BEGINNING OF RICHARD'S REIGN
BUT AT THAT TIME CHAUCER'S MISSIONS ABROAD AND HIS RESPONSIBLE
DUTIES IN THE PORT OF LONDON MAY HAVE FURNISHED REASONS FOR
SECURING HIM AGAINST ANNOYANCE OR FRIVOLOUS PROSECUTION WHICH
WERE WHOLLY WANTING AT THE LATER DATE
IN 1398 FORTUNE BEGAN
AGAIN TO SMILE UPON HIM HE RECEIVED A ROYAL GRANT OF A TUN OF
WINE ANNUALLY THE VALUE BEING ABOUT L4
NEXT YEAR RICHARD II
HAVING BEEN DEPOSED BY THE SON OF JOHN OF GAUNT 11
HENRY OF BOLINGBROKE DUKE OF LANCASTER THE NEW KING FOUR
DAYS AFTER HITS ACCESSION BESTOWED ON CHAUCER A GRANT OF FORTY
MARKS L26 13S
4D PER ANNUM IN ADDITION TO THE PENSION OF
L20 CONFERRED BY RICHARD II
IN 1394
BUT THE POET NOW
SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND PROBABLY BROKEN DOWN BY THE
REVERSES OF THE PAST FEW YEARS WAS NOT DESTINED LONG TO ENJOY
HIS RENEWED PROSPERITY
ON CHRISTMAS EVE OF 1399 HE ENTERED
ON THE POSSESSION OF A HOUSE IN THE GARDEN OF THE CHAPEL OF THE
BLESSED MARY OF WESTMINSTER NEAR TO THE PRESENT SITE OF
HENRY VII 'S CHAPEL HAVING OBTAINED A LEASE FROM ROBERT
HERMODESWORTH A MONK OF THE ADJACENT CONVENT FOR FIFTY THREE
YEARS AT THE ANNUAL RENT OF FOUR MARKS L2 13S
4D UNTIL THE
1ST OF MARCH 1400 CHAUCER DREW HIS PENSIONS IN PERSON THEN
THEY WERE RECEIVED FOR HIM BY ANOTHER HAND AND ON THE 25TH OF
OCTOBER IN THE SAME YEAR HE DIED AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY TWO
THE ONLY LIGHTS THROWN BY HIS POEMS ON HIS CLOSING DAYS ARE
FURNISHED IN THE LITTLE BALLAD CALLED GOOD COUNSEL OF CHAUCER
WHICH THOUGH SAID TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WHEN UPON HIS
DEATH BED LYING IN HIS GREAT ANGUISH BREATHES THE VERY SPIRIT OF
COURAGE RESIGNATION AND PHILOSOPHIC CALM AND BY THE
RETRACTATION AT THE END OF THE CANTERBURY TALES WHICH IF IT
WAS NOT FOISTED IN BY MONKISH TRANSCRIBERS MAY BE SUPPOSED THE
EFFECT OF CHAUCER'S REGRETS AND SELF REPROACHES ON THAT SOLEMN
REVIEW OF HIS LIFE WORK WHICH THE CLOSE APPROACH OF DEATH
COMPELLED
THE POET WAS BURIED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY 12
AND NOT MANY YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH A SLAB WAS PLACED ON A PILLAR
NEAR HIS GRAVE BEARING THE LINES TAKEN FROM AN EPITAPH OR
EULOGY MADE BY STEPHANUS SURIGONUS OF MILAN AT THE REQUEST OF

CONCERNING HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND HABITS CHAUCER HAS NOT
BEEN RETICENT IN HIS POETRY
URRY SUMS UP THE TRAITS OF HIS ASPECT
AND CHARACTER FAIRLY THUS HE WAS OF A MIDDLE STATURE THE LATTER
PART OF HIS LIFE INCLINABLE TO BE FAT AND CORPULENT AS APPEARS BY
THE HOST'S BANTERING HIM IN THE JOURNEY TO CANTERBURY AND
COMPARING SHAPES WITH HIM 16 HIS FACE WAS FLESHY HIS
FEATURES JUST AND REGULAR HIS COMPLEXION FAIR AND SOMEWHAT
PALE HIS HAIR OF A DUSKY YELLOW SHORT AND THIN THE HAIR OF HIS
BEARD IN TWO FORKED TUFTS OF A WHEAT COLOUR HIS FOREHEAD BROAD
AND SMOOTH HIS EYES INCLINING USUALLY TO THE GROUND WHICH IS
INTIMATED BY THE HOST'S WORDS HIS WHOLE FACE FULL OF LIVELINESS A
CALM EASY SWEETNESS AND A STUDIOUS VENERABLE ASPECT
AS
TO HIS TEMPER HE HAD A MIXTURE OF THE GAY THE MODEST AND THE
GRAVE
THE SPRIGHTLINESS OF HIS HUMOUR WAS MORE DISTINGUISHED
BY HIS WRITINGS THAN BY HIS APPEARANCE WHICH GAVE OCCASION TO
MARGARET COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE OFTEN TO RALLY HIM UPON HIS
SILENT MODESTY IN COMPANY TELLING HIM THAT HIS ABSENCE WAS
MORE AGREEABLE TO HER THAN HIS CONVERSATION SINCE THE FIRST WAS
PRODUCTIVE OF AGREEABLE PIECES OF WIT IN HIS WRITINGS 17 BUT
THE LATTER WAS FILLED WITH A MODEST DEFERENCE AND A TOO DISTANT
RESPECT
WE SEE NOTHING MERRY OR JOCOSE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR WITH
HIS PILGRIMS BUT A SILENT ATTENTION TO THEIR MIRTH RATHER THAN ANY
MIXTURE OF HIS OWN
WHEN DISENGAGED FROM PUBLIC AFFAIRS HIS
TIME WAS ENTIRELY SPENT IN STUDY AND READING SO AGREEABLE TO
HIM WAS THIS EXERCISE THAT HE SAYS HE PREFERRED IT TO ALL OTHER
SPORTS AND DIVERSIONS 18 HE LIVED WITHIN HIMSELF NEITHER
DESIROUS TO HEAR NOR BUSY TO CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE AFFAIRS OF
HIS NEIGHBOURS
HIS COURSE OF LIVING WAS TEMPERATE AND REGULAR
HE WENT TO REST WITH THE SUN AND ROSE BEFORE IT AND BY THAT
MEANS ENJOYED THE PLEASURES OF THE BETTER PART OF THE DAY HIS
MORNING WALK AND FRESH CONTEMPLATIONS
THIS GAVE HIM THE
ADVANTAGE OF DESCRIBING THE MORNING IN SO LIVELY A MANNER AS HE
DOES EVERYWHERE IN HIS WORKS
THE SPRINGING SUN GLOWS WARM IN
HIS LINES AND THE FRAGRANT AIR BLOWS COOL IN HIS DESCRIPTIONS WE
SMELL THE SWEETS OF THE BLOOMY HAWS AND HEAR THE MUSIC OF THE
FEATHERED CHOIR WHENEVER WE TAKE A FOREST WALK WITH HIM
THE
HOUR OF THE DAY IS NOT EASIER TO BE DISCOVERED FROM THE REFLECTION
OF THE SUN IN TITIAN'S PAINTINGS THAN IN CHAUCER'S MORNING
LANDSCAPES
HIS READING WAS DEEP AND EXTENSIVE HIS
JUDGEMENT SOUND AND DISCERNING
IN ONE WORD HE WAS A GREAT
SCHOLAR A PLEASANT WIT A CANDID CRITIC A SOCIABLE COMPANION A
STEADFAST FRIEND A GRAVE PHILOSOPHER A TEMPERATE ECONOMIST
AND A PIOUS CHRISTIAN
CHAUCER'S MOST IMPORTANT POEMS ARE TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
THE ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE AND THE CANTERBURY TALES OF
THE FIRST CONTAINING 8246 LINES AN ABRIDGEMENT WITH A PROSE
CONNECTING OUTLINE OF THE STORY IS GIVEN IN THIS VOLUME
WITH THE
SECOND CONSISTING OF 7699 OCTOSYLLABIC VERSES LIKE THOSE IN
WHICH THE HOUSE OF FAME IS WRITTEN IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE
TO DEAL IN THE PRESENT EDITION
THE POEM IS A CURTAILED TRANSLATION
FROM THE FRENCH ROMAN DE LA ROSE COMMENCED BY
GUILLAUME DE LORRIS WHO DIED IN 1260 AFTER CONTRIBUTING 4070
VERSES AND COMPLETED IN THE LAST QUARTER OF THE THIRTEENTH
CENTURY BY JEAN DE MEUN WHO ADDED SOME 18 000 VERSES
IT IS
A SATIRICAL ALLEGORY IN WHICH THE VICES OF COURTS THE CORRUPTIONS
OF THE CLERGY THE DISORDERS AND INEQUALITIES OF SOCIETY IN GENERAL
ARE UNSPARINGLY ATTACKED AND THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY DOCTRINES
ARE ADVANCED AND THOUGH IN MAKING HIS TRANSLATION CHAUCER
SOFTENED OR ELIMINATED MUCH OF THE SATIRE OF THE POEM STILL IT
REMAINED IN HIS VERSE A CAUSTIC EXPOSURE OF THE ABUSES OF THE
TIME ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH DISCREDITED THE CHURCH
THE CANTERBURY TALES ARE PRESENTED IN THIS EDITION WITH AS NEAR
AN APPROACH TO COMPLETENESS AS REGARD FOR THE POPULAR CHARACTER
OF THE VOLUME PERMITTED
THE 17 385 VERSES OF WHICH THE
POETICAL TALES CONSIST HAVE BEEN GIVEN WITHOUT ABRIDGEMENT OR
PURGATION SAVE IN A SINGLE COUPLET BUT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF
THE VOLUME BEING TO MAKE THE GENERAL READER ACQUAINTED WITH
THE POEMS OF CHAUCER AND SPENSER THE EDITOR HAS VENTURED TO
CONTRACT THE TWO PROSE TALES CHAUCER'S TALE OF MELIBOEUS
AND THE PARSON'S SERMON OR TREATISE ON PENITENCE SO AS TO
SAVE ABOUT THIRTY PAGES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF CHAUCER'S MINOR
PIECES
AT THE SAME TIME BY GIVING PROSE OUTLINES OF THE OMITTED
PARTS IT HAS BEEN SOUGHT TO GUARD THE READER AGAINST THE FEAR
THAT HE WAS LOSING ANYTHING ESSENTIAL OR EVEN VALUABLE
IT IS
ALMOST NEEDLESS TO DESCRIBE THE PLOT OR POINT OUT THE LITERARY
PLACE OF THE CANTERBURY TALES
PERHAPS IN THE ENTIRE RANGE OF
ANCIENT AND MODERN LITERATURE THERE IS NO WORK THAT SO CLEARLY
AND FRESHLY PAINTS FOR FUTURE TIMES THE PICTURE OF THE PAST
CERTAINLY NO ENGLISHMAN HAS EVER APPROACHED CHAUCER IN THE
POWER OF FIXING FOR EVER THE FLEETING TRAITS OF HIS OWN TIME
THE
PLAN OF THE POEM HAD BEEN ADOPTED BEFORE CHAUCER CHOSE IT
NOTABLY IN THE DECAMERON OF BOCCACCIO ALTHOUGH THERE THE
CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE TALES WERE TOLD WITH THE TERROR
OF THE PLAGUE HANGING OVER THE MERRY COMPANY LEND A GRIM
GROTESQUENESS TO THE NARRATIVE UNLESS WE CAN LOOK AT IT
ABSTRACTED FROM ITS SETTING
CHAUCER ON THE OTHER HAND STRIKES
A PERPETUAL KEY NOTE OF GAIETY WHENEVER HE MENTIONS THE WORD
PILGRIMAGE AND AT EVERY STAGE OF THE CONNECTING STORY WE
BLESS THE HAPPY THOUGHT WHICH GIVES US INCESSANT INCIDENT
MOVEMENT VARIETY AND UNCLOUDED BUT NEVER MONOTONOUS
JOYOUSNESS
THE POET THE EVENING BEFORE HE STARTS ON A PILGRIMAGE TO THE
SHRINE OF ST THOMAS AT CANTERBURY LIES AT THE TABARD INN IN
SOUTHWARK CURIOUS TO KNOW IN WHAT COMPANIONSHIP HE IS
DESTINED TO FARE FORWARD ON THE MORROW
CHANCE SENDS HIM
NINE AND TWENTY IN A COMPANY REPRESENTING ALL ORDERS OF
ENGLISH SOCIETY LAY AND CLERICAL FROM THE KNIGHT AND THE ABBOT
DOWN TO THE PLOUGHMAN AND THE SOMPNOUR
THE JOLLY HOST OF
THE TABARD AFTER SUPPER WHEN TONGUES ARE LOOSENED AND HEARTS
ARE OPENED DECLARES THAT NOT THIS YEAR HAS HE SEEN SUCH A
COMPANY AT ONCE UNDER HIS ROOF TREE AND PROPOSES THAT WHEN
THEY SET OUT NEXT MORNING HE SHOULD RIDE WITH THEM AND MAKE
THEM SPORT
ALL AGREE AND HARRY BAILLY UNFOLDS HIS SCHEME EACH
PILGRIM INCLUDING THE POET SHALL TELL TWO TALES ON THE ROAD TO
CANTERBURY AND TWO ON THE WAY BACK TO LONDON AND HE WHOM
THE GENERAL VOICE PRONOUNCES TO HAVE TOLD THE BEST TALE SHALL BE
TREATED TO A SUPPER AT THE COMMON COST AND OF COURSE TO
MINE HOST'S PROFIT WHEN THE CAVALCADE RETURNS FROM THE SAINT'S
SHRINE TO THE SOUTHWARK HOSTELRY
ALL JOYOUSLY ASSENT AND EARLY
ON THE MORROW IN THE GAY SPRING SUNSHINE THEY RIDE FORTH
LISTENING TO THE HEROIC TALE OF THE BRAVE AND GENTLE KNIGHT WHO
HAS BEEN GRACEFULLY CHOSEN BY THE HOST TO LEAD THE SPIRITED
COMPETITION OF STORY TELLING
TO DESCRIBE THUS THE NATURE OF THE PLAN AND TO SAY THAT WHEN
CHAUCER CONCEIVED OR AT LEAST BEGAN TO EXECUTE IT HE WAS
BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE IS TO PROCLAIM THAT THE
CANTERBURY TALES COULD NEVER BE MORE THAN A FRAGMENT
THIRTY
PILGRIMS EACH TELLING TWO TALES ON THE WAY OUT AND TWO MORE
ON THE WAY BACK THAT MAKES 120 TALES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE
PROLOGUE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE JOURNEY THE OCCURRENCES AT
CANTERBURY AND ALL THE REMNANT OF THEIR PILGRIMAGE WHICH
CHAUCER ALSO UNDERTOOK
NO MORE THAN TWENTY THREE OF THE 120
STORIES ARE TOLD IN THE WORK AS IT COMES DOWN TO US THAT IS ONLY
TWENTY THREE OF THE THIRTY PILGRIMS TELL THE FIRST OF THE TWO STORIES
ON THE ROAD TO CANTERBURY WHILE OF THE STORIES ON THE RETURN
JOURNEY WE HAVE NOT ONE AND NOTHING IS SAID ABOUT THE DOINGS
OF THE PILGRIMS AT CANTERBURY WHICH WOULD IF TREATED LIKE THE
SCENE AT THE TABARD HAVE GIVEN US A STILL LIVELIER PICTURE OF THE
PERIOD BUT THE PLAN WAS TOO LARGE AND ALTHOUGH THE POET HAD
SOME RESERVES IN STORIES WHICH HE HAD ALREADY COMPOSED IN AN
INDEPENDENT FORM DEATH CUT SHORT HIS LABOUR ERE HE COULD EVEN
COMPLETE THE ARRANGEMENT AND CONNECTION OF MORE THAN A VERY
FEW OF THE TALES
INCOMPLETE AS IT IS HOWEVER THE MAGNUM
OPUS OF CHAUCER WAS IN HIS OWN TIME RECEIVED WITH IMMENSE
FAVOUR MANUSCRIPT COPIES ARE NUMEROUS EVEN NOW NO SLIGHT
PROOF OF ITS POPULARITY AND WHEN THE INVENTION OF PRINTING WAS
INTRODUCED INTO ENGLAND BY WILLIAM CAXTON THE CANTERBURY
TALES ISSUED FROM HIS PRESS IN THE YEAR AFTER THE FIRST ENGLISH
PRINTED BOOK THE GAME OF THE CHESSE HAD BEEN STRUCK OFF
INNUMERABLE EDITIONS HAVE SINCE BEEN PUBLISHED AND IT MAY
FAIRLY BE AFFIRMED THAT FEW BOOKS HAVE BEEN SO MUCH IN FAVOUR
WITH THE READING PUBLIC OF EVERY GENERATION AS THIS BOOK WHICH
THE LAPSE OF EVERY GENERATION HAS BEEN RENDERING MORE
UNREADABLE
APART FROM THE ROMAUNT OF THE ROSE NO REALLY IMPORTANT
POETICAL WORK OF CHAUCER'S IS OMITTED FROM OR UNREPRESENTED IN
THE PRESENT EDITION
OF THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN THE
PROLOGUE ONLY IS GIVEN BUT IT IS THE MOST GENUINELY CHAUCERIAN
PART OF THE POEM
OF THE COURT OF LOVE THREE FOURTHS ARE
HERE PRESENTED OF THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS THE CUCKOO AND
THE NIGHTINGALE THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF ALL OF CHAUCER'S
DREAM ONE FOURTH OF THE HOUSE OF FAME TWO THIRDS AND
OF THE MINOR POEMS SUCH A SELECTION AS MAY GIVE AN IDEA OF
CHAUCER'S POWER IN THE OCCASIONAL DEPARTMENT OF VERSE
NECESSARILY NO SPACE WHATEVER COULD BE GIVEN TO CHAUCER'S
PROSE WORKS HIS TRANSLATION OF BOETHIUS' TREATISE ON THE
CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY HIS TREATISE ON THE ASTROLABE
WRITTEN FOR THE USE OF HIS SON LEWIS AND HIS TESTAMENT OF
LOVE COMPOSED IN HIS LATER YEARS AND REFLECTING THE TROUBLES
THAT THEN BESET THE POET
IF AFTER STUDYING IN A SIMPLIFIED FORM
THE SALIENT WORKS OF ENGLAND'S FIRST GREAT BARD THE READER IS
TEMPTED TO REGRET THAT HE WAS NOT INTRODUCED TO A WIDER
ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE AUTHOR THE PURPOSE OF THE EDITOR WILL
HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ATTAINED
THE PLAN OF THE VOLUME DOES NOT DEMAND AN ELABORATE
EXAMINATION INTO THE STATE OF OUR LANGUAGE WHEN CHAUCER WROTE
OR THE NICE QUESTIONS OF GRAMMATICAL AND METRICAL STRUCTURE
WHICH CONSPIRE WITH THE OBSOLETE ORTHOGRAPHY TO MAKE HIS
POEMS A SEALED BOOK FOR THE MASSES
THE MOST IMPORTANT
ELEMENT IN THE PROPER READING OF CHAUCER'S VERSES WHETHER
WRITTEN IN THE DECASYLLABIC OR HEROIC METRE WHICH HE INTRODUCED
INTO OUR LITERATURE OR IN THE OCTOSYLLABIC MEASURE USED WITH SUCH
ANIMATED EFFECT IN THE HOUSE OF FAME CHAUCER'S DREAM
C
IS THE SOUNDING OF THE TERMINAL E WHERE IT IS NOW SILENT
THAT LETTER IS STILL VALID IN FRENCH POETRY AND CHAUCER'S LINES CAN
BE SCANNED ONLY BY READING THEM AS WE WOULD READ RACINE'S OR
MOLIERE'S
THE TERMINAL E PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN
GRAMMAR IN MANY CASES IT WAS THE SIGN OF THE INFINITIVE THE
N BEING DROPPED FROM THE END AT OTHER TIMES IT POINTED THE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN SINGULAR AND PLURAL BETWEEN ADJECTIVE AND
ADVERB
THE PAGES THAT FOLLOW HOWEVER BEING PREPARED FROM
THE MODERN ENGLISH POINT OF VIEW NECESSARILY NO ACCOUNT IS
TAKEN OF THOSE DISTINCTIONS AND THE NOW SILENT E HAS BEEN
RETAINED IN THE TEXT OF CHAUCER ONLY WHEN REQUIRED BY THE
MODERN SPELLING OR BY THE EXIGENCIES OF METRE
BEFORE A WORD BEGINNING WITH A VOWEL OR WITH THE LETTER H
THE FINAL E WAS ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION MUTE AND IN SUCH
CASES IN THE PLURAL FORMS AND INFINITIVES OF VERBS THE TERMINAL
N IS GENERALLY RETAINED FOR THE SAKE OF EUPHONY
NO READER
WHO IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE FRENCH LANGUAGE WILL FIND IT HARD TO
FALL INTO CHAUCER'S ACCENTUATION WHILE FOR SUCH AS ARE NOT A
SIMPLE PERUSAL OF THE TEXT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MODERN
VERSE SHOULD REMOVE EVERY DIFFICULTY

CALLED IN THE EDITIONS BEFORE 1597 THE DREAM OF CHAUCER
THE POEM WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT EDITION DOES
INDEED LIKE MANY OF CHAUCER'S SMALLER WORKS TELL THE STORY OF A
DREAM IN WHICH A KNIGHT REPRESENTING JOHN OF GAUNT IS FOUND
BY THE POET MOURNING THE LOSS OF HIS LADY BUT THE TRUE DREAM
OF CHAUCER IN WHICH HE CELEBRATES THE MARRIAGE OF HIS PATRON
WAS PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME BY SPEGHT IN 1597
JOHN OF
GAUNT IN THE END OF 1371 MARRIED HIS SECOND WIFE CONSTANCE

THE OLD BIOGRAPHERS OF CHAUCER FOUNDING ON WHAT THEY TOOK
TO BE AUTOBIOGRAPHIC ALLUSIONS IN THE TESTAMENT OF LOVE
ASSIGN TO HIM BETWEEN 1354 AND 1389 A VERY DIFFERENT HISTORY
FROM THAT HERE GIVEN ON THE STRENGTH OF AUTHENTIC RECORDS
EXPLORED AND QUOTED BY SIR H
NICOLAS
CHAUCER IS MADE TO
ESPOUSE THE CAUSE OF JOHN OF NORTHAMPTON THE WYCLIFFITE LORD
MAYOR OF LONDON WHOSE RE ELECTION IN 1384 WAS SO
VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED BY THE CLERGY AND WHO WAS IMPRISONED IN
THE SEQUEL OF THE GRAVE DISORDERS THAT AROSE
THE POET IT IS SAID
FLED TO THE CONTINENT TAKING WITH HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
WHICH HE SPENT IN SUPPORTING COMPANIONS IN EXILE THEN
RETURNING BY STEALTH TO ENGLAND IN QUEST OF FUNDS HE WAS
DETECTED AND SENT TO THE TOWER WHERE HE LANGUISHED FOR THREE
YEARS BEING RELEASED ONLY ON THE HUMILIATING CONDITION OF
INFORMING AGAINST HIS ASSOCIATES IN THE PLOT
THE PUBLIC RECORDS
SHOW HOWEVER THAT ALL THE TIME OF HIS ALLEGED EXILE AND
CAPTIVITY HE WAS QUIETLY LIVING IN LONDON REGULARLY DRAWING HIS
PENSIONS IN PERSON SITTING IN PARLIAMENT AND DISCHARGING HIS
DUTIES IN THE CUSTOMS UNTIL HIS DISMISSAL IN 1386
IT NEED NOT BE
SAID FURTHER THAT ALTHOUGH CHAUCER FREELY HANDLED THE ERRORS
THE IGNORANCE AND VICES OF THE CLERGY HE DID SO RATHER AS A MAN
OF SENSE AND OF CONSCIENCE THAN AS A WYCLIFFITE AND THERE IS
NO EVIDENCE THAT HE ESPOUSED THE OPINIONS OF THE ZEALOUS
REFORMER FAR LESS PLAYED THE PART OF AN EXTREME AND SELF
REGARDLESS PARTISAN OF HIS OLD FRIEND AND COLLEGE COMPANION
9
THE COMMISSIONERS APPEAR TO HAVE COMMENCED THEIR
LABOURS WITH EXAMINING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED IN
THE COLLECTION OF THE REVENUE AND THE SEQUEL AFFORDS A STRONG
PRESUMPTION THAT THE ROYAL ADMINISTRATION UNDER LANCASTER AND
HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN FOULLY CALUMNIATED
WE HEAR NOT OF ANY
FRAUDS DISCOVERED OR OF DEFAULTERS PUNISHED OR OF GRIEVANCES
REDRESSED SUCH IS THE TESTIMONY OF LINGARD CHAP
IV 1386
ALL THE MORE VALUABLE FOR HIS AVERSION FROM THE WYCLIFFITE
LEANINGS OF JOHN OF GAUNT
CHAUCER'S DEPARTMENT IN THE LONDON
CUSTOMS WAS IN THOSE DAYS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND
LUCRATIVE IN THE KINGDOM AND IF MERCENARY ABUSE OF HIS POST
COULD HAVE BEEN PROVED WE MAY BE SURE THAT HIS AND HIS
PATRON'S ENEMIES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CONTENT WITH SIMPLE
DISMISSAL BUT WOULD HAVE HEAVILY AMERCED OR IMPRISONED HIM
10
THE SALARY WAS L36 10S
PER ANNUM THE SALARY OF THE CHIEF
JUDGES WAS L40 OF THE PUISNE JUDGES ABOUT L27
PROBABLY THE
JUDGES CERTAINLY THE CLERK OF THE WORKS HAD FEES OR
PERQUISITES BESIDES THE STATED PAYMENT
11
CHAUCER'S PATRON HAD DIED EARLIER IN 1399 DURING THE EXILE
OF HIS SON THEN DUKE OF HEREFORD IN FRANCE
THE DUCHESS
CONSTANCE HAD DIED IN 1394 AND THE DUKE HAD MADE REPARATION
TO KATHERINE SWYNFORD WHO HAD ALREADY BORNE HIM FOUR
CHILDREN BY MARRYING HER IN 1396 WITH THE APPROVAL OF
RICHARD II WHO LEGITIMATED THE CHILDREN AND MADE THE ELDEST
SON OF THE POET'S SISTER IN LAW EARL OF SOMERSET

PROMINENTLY IN THE SECOND RANK OF COURTIERS FOR MANY YEARS
HE
WAS CHIEF BUTLER TO RICHARD II UNDER HENRY IV
HE WAS
CONSTABLE OF WALLINGFORD CASTLE STEWARD OF THE HONOURS OF
WALLINGFORD AND ST VALERY AND OF THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS AND
THE QUEEN OF HENRY IV
GRANTED HIM THE FARM OF SEVERAL OF HER
MANORS A GRANT SUBSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED TO HIM FOR LIFE BY THE
KING AFTER THE QUEEN'S DEATH

FOR OXFORDSHIRE WAS SPEAKER IN 1414 AND IN THE SAME YEAR
WENT TO FRANCE AS COMMISSIONER TO NEGOTIATE THE MARRIAGE OF

OF EDWARD IV
THE ELDEST SON OF THIS MARRIAGE CREATED EARL OF
LINCOLN WAS DECLARED BY RICHARD III HEIR APPARENT TO THE
THRONE IN CASE THE PRINCE OF WALES SHOULD DIE WITHOUT ISSUE BUT
THE DEATH OF LINCOLN HIMSELF AT THE BATTLE OF STOKE IN 1487
DESTROYED ALL PROSPECT THAT THE POET'S DESCENDANTS MIGHT
SUCCEED TO THE CROWN OF ENGLAND AND HIS FAMILY IS NOW BELIEVED
TO BE EXTINCT

A KNIGHT THERE WAS AND THAT A WORTHY MAN
THAT FROM THE TIME THAT HE FIRST BEGAN
TO RIDEN OUT HE LOVED CHIVALRY
TRUTH AND HONOUR FREEDOM AND COURTESY
FULL WORTHY WAS HE IN HIS LORDE'S WAR
AND THERETO HAD HE RIDDEN NO MAN FARRE FARTHER

THIS ILKE WORTHY KNIGHT HAD BEEN ALSO SAME 9

AND EVERMORE HE HAD A SOVEREIGN PRICE
HE WAS HELD IN VERY
AND THOUGH THAT HE WAS WORTHY HE WAS WISE HIGH ESTEEM
AND OF HIS PORT AS MEEK AS IS A MAID
HE NEVER YET NO VILLAINY NE SAID
IN ALL HIS LIFE UNTO NO MANNER WIGHT
HE WAS A VERY PERFECT GENTLE KNIGHT
BUT FOR TO TELLE YOU OF HIS ARRAY
HIS HORSE WAS GOOD BUT YET HE WAS NOT GAY
OF FUSTIAN HE WEARED A GIPON SHORT DOUBLET
ALLE BESMOTTER'D WITH HIS HABERGEON SOILED BY HIS COAT OF MAIL

IN HOPE TO STANDEN IN HIS LADY'S GRACE
EMBROIDER'D WAS HE AS IT WERE A MEAD

SO HOT HE LOVED THAT BY NIGHTERTALE NIGHT TIME
HE SLEPT NO MORE THAN DOTH THE NIGHTINGALE
COURTEOUS HE WAS LOWLY AND SERVICEABLE
AND CARV'D BEFORE HIS FATHER AT THE TABLE 10
A YEOMAN HAD HE AND SERVANTS NO MO'
AT THAT TIME FOR HIM LIST RIDE SO IT PLEASED HIM SO TO RIDE
AND HE WAS CLAD IN COAT AND HOOD OF GREEN
A SHEAF OF PEACOCK ARROWS 11 BRIGHT AND KEEN
UNDER HIS BELT HE BARE FULL THRIFTILY
WELL COULD HE DRESS HIS TACKLE YEOMANLY
HIS ARROWS DROOPED NOT WITH FEATHERS LOW
AND IN HIS HAND HE BARE A MIGHTY BOW
A NUT HEAD 12 HAD HE WITH A BROWN VISIAGE
OF WOOD CRAFT COUD HE WELL ALL THE USAGE KNEW
UPON HIS ARM HE BARE A GAY BRACER SMALL SHIELD
AND BY HIS SIDE A SWORD AND A BUCKLER
AND ON THAT OTHER SIDE A GAY DAGGERE
HARNESSED WELL AND SHARP AS POINT OF SPEAR
A CHRISTOPHER ON HIS BREAST OF SILVER SHEEN
AN HORN HE BARE THE BALDRIC WAS OF GREEN
A FORESTER WAS HE SOOTHLY AS I GUESS
CERTAINLY
THERE WAS ALSO A NUN A PRIORESS
THAT OF HER SMILING WAS FULL SIMPLE AND COY
HER GREATEST OATHE WAS BUT BY SAINT LOY
AND SHE WAS CLEPED MADAME EGLENTINE
CALLED
FULL WELL SHE SANG THE SERVICE DIVINE
ENTUNED IN HER NOSE FULL SEEMLY
AND FRENCH SHE SPAKE FULL FAIR AND FETISLY PROPERLY
AFTER THE SCHOOL OF STRATFORD ATTE BOW
FOR FRENCH OF PARIS WAS TO HER UNKNOW
AT MEATE WAS SHE WELL Y TAUGHT WITHAL
SHE LET NO MORSEL FROM HER LIPPES FALL
NOR WET HER FINGERS IN HER SAUCE DEEP
WELL COULD SHE CARRY A MORSEL AND WELL KEEP
THAT NO DROPPE NE FELL UPON HER BREAST
IN COURTESY WAS SET FULL MUCH HER LEST
PLEASURE
HER OVER LIPPE WIPED SHE SO CLEAN
THAT IN HER CUP THERE WAS NO FARTHING SEEN SPECK
OF GREASE WHEN SHE DRUNKEN HAD HER DRAUGHT
FULL SEEMELY AFTER HER MEAT SHE RAUGHT REACHED OUT HER HAND
AND SICKERLY SHE WAS OF GREAT DISPORT SURELY SHE WAS OF A LIVELY
AND FULL PLEASANT AND AMIABLE OF PORT DISPOSITION
AND PAINED HER TO COUNTERFEITE CHEER TOOK PAINS TO ASSUME
OF COURT AND BE ESTATELY OF MANNERE A COURTLY DISPOSITION
AND TO BE HOLDEN DIGNE OF REVERENCE
WORTHY
BUT FOR TO SPEAKEN OF HER CONSCIENCE
SHE WAS SO CHARITABLE AND SO PITOUS FULL OF PITY
SHE WOULDE WEEP IF THAT SHE SAW A MOUSE
CAUGHT IN A TRAP IF IT WERE DEAD OR BLED
OF SMALLE HOUNDES HAD SHE THAT SHE FED
WITH ROASTED FLESH AND MILK AND WASTEL BREAD FINEST WHITE BREAD
BUT SORE SHE WEPT IF ONE OF THEM WERE DEAD
OR IF MEN SMOTE IT WITH A YARDE SMART STAFF
AND ALL WAS CONSCIENCE AND TENDER HEART
FULL SEEMLY HER WIMPLE Y PINCHED WAS
HER NOSE TRETIS HER EYEN GRAY AS GLASS 13 WELL FORMED
HER MOUTH FULL SMALL AND THERETO SOFT AND RED
BUT SICKERLY SHE HAD A FAIR FOREHEAD
IT WAS ALMOST A SPANNE BROAD I TROW
FOR HARDILY SHE WAS NOT UNDERGROW
CERTAINLY SHE WAS NOT SMALL
FULL FETIS WAS HER CLOAK AS I WAS WARE
NEAT
OF SMALL CORAL ABOUT HER ARM SHE BARE
A PAIR OF BEADES GAUDED ALL WITH GREEN
AND THEREON HUNG A BROOCH OF GOLD FULL SHEEN
ON WHICH WAS FIRST Y WRITTEN A CROWN'D A
AND AFTER AMOR VINCIT OMNIA LOVE CONQUERS ALL
ANOTHER NUN ALSO WITH HER HAD SHE
THAT WAS HER CHAPELLEINE AND PRIESTES THREE
A MONK THERE WAS A FAIR FOR THE MAST'RY ABOVE ALL OTHERS 14
AN OUT RIDER THAT LOVED VENERY HUNTING
A MANLY MAN TO BE AN ABBOT ABLE
FULL MANY A DAINTY HORSE HAD HE IN STABLE
AND WHEN HE RODE MEN MIGHT HIS BRIDLE HEAR
JINGELING 15 IN A WHISTLING WIND AS CLEAR
AND EKE AS LOUD AS DOTH THE CHAPEL BELL
THERE AS THIS LORD WAS KEEPER OF THE CELL
THE RULE OF SAINT MAUR AND OF SAINT BENET 16
BECAUSE THAT IT WAS OLD AND SOMEDEAL STRAIT
THIS ILKE MONK LET OLDE THINGES PACE SAME
AND HELD AFTER THE NEWE WORLD THE TRACE
HE GAVE NOT OF THE TEXT A PULLED HEN HE CARED NOTHING
THAT SAITH THAT HUNTERS BE NOT HOLY MEN FOR THE TEXT
NE THAT A MONK WHEN HE IS CLOISTERLESS
IS LIKE TO A FISH THAT IS WATERLESS
THIS IS TO SAY A MONK OUT OF HIS CLOISTER
THIS ILKE TEXT HELD HE NOT WORTH AN OYSTER
AND I SAY HIS OPINION WAS GOOD
WHY SHOULD HE STUDY AND MAKE HIMSELFE WOOD MAD 17
UPON A BOOK IN CLOISTER ALWAYS PORE
OR SWINKEN WITH HIS HANDES AND LABOUR TOIL
AS AUSTIN BID HOW SHALL THE WORLD BE SERVED
LET AUSTIN HAVE HIS SWINK TO HIM RESERVED
THEREFORE HE WAS A PRICKASOUR ARIGHT HARD RIDER
GREYHOUNDS HE HAD AS SWIFT AS FOWL OF FLIGHT
OF PRICKING AND OF HUNTING FOR THE HARE RIDING
WAS ALL HIS LUST FOR NO COST WOULD HE SPARE
PLEASURE
I SAW HIS SLEEVES PURFIL'D AT THE HAND WORKED AT THE END WITH A
WITH GRIS AND THAT THE FINEST OF THE LAND
FUR CALLED GRIS
AND FOR TO FASTEN HIS HOOD UNDER HIS CHIN
HE HAD OF GOLD Y WROUGHT A CURIOUS PIN
A LOVE KNOT IN THE GREATER END THERE WAS
HIS HEAD WAS BALD AND SHONE AS ANY GLASS
AND EKE HIS FACE AS IT HAD BEEN ANOINT
HE WAS A LORD FULL FAT AND IN GOOD POINT
HIS EYEN STEEP AND ROLLING IN HIS HEAD DEEP SET
THAT STEAMED AS A FURNACE OF A LEAD
HIS BOOTES SUPPLE HIS HORSE IN GREAT ESTATE
NOW CERTAINLY HE WAS A FAIR PRELATE
HE WAS NOT PALE AS A FORPINED GHOST WASTED
A FAT SWAN LOV'D HE BEST OF ANY ROAST
HIS PALFREY WAS AS BROWN AS IS A BERRY
A FRIAR THERE WAS A WANTON AND A MERRY
A LIMITOUR 18 A FULL SOLEMNE MAN
IN ALL THE ORDERS FOUR IS NONE THAT CAN KNOWS
SO MUCH OF DALLIANCE AND FAIR LANGUAGE
HE HAD Y MADE FULL MANY A MARRIAGE
OF YOUNGE WOMEN AT HIS OWEN COST
UNTO HIS ORDER HE WAS A NOBLE POST
FULL WELL BELOV'D AND FAMILIAR WAS HE
WITH FRANKLINS OVER ALL IN HIS COUNTRY EVERYWHERE
AND EKE WITH WORTHY WOMEN OF THE TOWN
FOR HE HAD POWER OF CONFESSION
AS SAID HIMSELFE MORE THAN A CURATE
FOR OF HIS ORDER HE WAS LICENTIATE
FULL SWEETELY HEARD HE CONFESSION
AND PLEASANT WAS HIS ABSOLUTION
HE WAS AN EASY MAN TO GIVE PENANCE
THERE AS HE WIST TO HAVE A GOOD PITTANCE WHERE HE KNOW HE WOULD
FOR UNTO A POOR ORDER FOR TO GIVE GET GOOD PAYMENT
IS SIGNE THAT A MAN IS WELL Y SHRIVE
FOR IF HE GAVE HE DURSTE MAKE AVANT DARED TO BOAST
HE WISTE THAT THE MAN WAS REPENTANT
KNEW
FOR MANY A MAN SO HARD IS OF HIS HEART
HE MAY NOT WEEP ALTHOUGH HIM SORE SMART
THEREFORE INSTEAD OF WEEPING AND PRAYERES
MEN MUST GIVE SILVER TO THE POORE FRERES
HIS TIPPET WAS AYE FARSED FULL OF KNIVES STUFFED
AND PINNES FOR TO GIVE TO FAIRE WIVES
AND CERTAINLY HE HAD A MERRY NOTE
WELL COULD HE SING AND PLAYEN ON A ROTE FROM MEMORY
OF YEDDINGS HE BARE UTTERLY THE PRIZE

HIS NECK WAS WHITE AS IS THE FLEUR DE LIS
THERETO HE STRONG WAS AS A CHAMPION
AND KNEW WELL THE TAVERNS IN EVERY TOWN
AND EVERY HOSTELER AND GAY TAPSTERE
BETTER THAN A LAZAR OR A BEGGERE LEPER
FOR UNTO SUCH A WORTHY MAN AS HE
ACCORDETH NOT AS BY HIS FACULTY
TO HAVE WITH SUCH LAZARS ACQUAINTANCE
IT IS NOT HONEST IT MAY NOT ADVANCE
AS FOR TO DEALE WITH NO SUCH POURAILLE OFFAL REFUSE
BUT ALL WITH RICH AND SELLERS OF VITAILLE
VICTUALS
AND OV'R ALL THERE AS PROFIT SHOULD ARISE IN EVERY PLACE WHERE
COURTEOUS HE WAS AND LOWLY OF SERVICE
THERE N'AS NO MAN NOWHERE SO VIRTUOUS
HE WAS THE BESTE BEGGAR IN ALL HIS HOUSE
AND GAVE A CERTAIN FARME FOR THE GRANT 19
NONE OF HIS BRETHEREN CAME IN HIS HAUNT
FOR THOUGH A WIDOW HADDE BUT ONE SHOE
SO PLEASANT WAS HIS IN PRINCIPIO 20
YET WOULD HE HAVE A FARTHING ERE HE WENT
HIS PURCHASE WAS WELL BETTER THAN HIS RENT
AND RAGE HE COULD AND PLAY AS ANY WHELP
IN LOVEDAYS 21 THERE COULD HE MUCHEL HELP
GREATLY
FOR THERE WAS HE NOT LIKE A CLOISTERER
WITH THREADBARE COPE AS IS A POOR SCHOLER
BUT HE WAS LIKE A MASTER OR A POPE
OF DOUBLE WORSTED WAS HIS SEMICOPE SHORT CLOAK
THAT ROUNDED WAS AS A BELL OUT OF PRESS
SOMEWHAT HE LISPED FOR HIS WANTONNESS
TO MAKE HIS ENGLISH SWEET UPON HIS TONGUE
AND IN HIS HARPING WHEN THAT HE HAD SUNG
HIS EYEN TWINKLED IN HIS HEAD ARIGHT EYES
AS DO THE STARRES IN A FROSTY NIGHT
THIS WORTHY LIMITOUR 18 WAS CALL'D HUBERD
A MERCHANT WAS THERE WITH A FORKED BEARD

GREAT WAS THE STRIFE AND LONG BETWEEN THESE TWAY
IF THAT I HADDE LEISURE FOR TO SAY
BUT TO THE EFFECT IT HAPPEN'D ON A DAY
TO TELL IT YOU AS SHORTLY AS I MAY
A WORTHY DUKE THAT HIGHT PERITHOUS 14
THAT FELLOW WAS TO THE DUKE THESEUS
SINCE THILKE DAY THAT THEY WERE CHILDREN LITE THAT LITTLE
WAS COME TO ATHENS HIS FELLOW TO VISITE
AND FOR TO PLAY AS HE WAS WONT TO DO
FOR IN THIS WORLD HE LOVED NO MAN SO
AND HE LOV'D HIM AS TENDERLY AGAIN
SO WELL THEY LOV'D AS OLDE BOOKES SAYN
THAT WHEN THAT ONE WAS DEAD SOOTHLY TO SAYN
HIS FELLOW WENT AND SOUGHT HIM DOWN IN HELL
BUT OF THAT STORY LIST ME NOT TO WRITE
DUKE PERITHOUS LOVED WELL ARCITE
AND HAD HIM KNOWN AT THEBES YEAR BY YEAR
AND FINALLY AT REQUEST AND PRAYERE
OF PERITHOUS WITHOUTE RANSON
DUKE THESEUS HIM LET OUT OF PRISON
FREELY TO GO WHERE HIM LIST OVER ALL
IN SUCH A GUISE AS I YOU TELLEN SHALL
THIS WAS THE FORWORD PLAINLY TO INDITE PROMISE
BETWIXTE THESEUS AND HIM ARCITE
THAT IF SO WERE THAT ARCITE WERE Y FOUND
EVER IN HIS LIFE BY DAY OR NIGHT ONE STOUND MOMENT 15
IN ANY COUNTRY OF THIS THESEUS
AND HE WERE CAUGHT IT WAS ACCORDED THUS
THAT WITH A SWORD HE SHOULDE LOSE HIS HEAD
THERE WAS NONE OTHER REMEDY NOR REDE
COUNSEL
BUT TOOK HIS LEAVE AND HOMEWARD HE HIM SPED
LET HIM BEWARE HIS NECKE LIETH TO WED
IN PLEDGE
HOW GREAT A SORROW SUFF'RETH NOW ARCITE
THE DEATH HE FEELETH THROUGH HIS HEARTE SMITE
HE WEEPETH WAILETH CRIETH PITEOUSLY
TO SLAY HIMSELF HE WAITETH PRIVILY
HE SAID ALAS THE DAY THAT I WAS BORN
NOW IS MY PRISON WORSE THAN BEFORN
NOW IS ME SHAPE ETERNALLY TO DWELL IT IS FIXED FOR ME
NOT IN PURGATORY BUT RIGHT IN HELL
ALAS THAT EVER I KNEW PERITHOUS
FOR ELLES HAD I DWELT WITH THESEUS
Y FETTERED IN HIS PRISON EVERMO'
THEN HAD I BEEN IN BLISS AND NOT IN WOE
ONLY THE SIGHT OF HER WHOM THAT I SERVE
THOUGH THAT I NEVER MAY HER GRACE DESERVE
WOULD HAVE SUFFICED RIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME
O DEARE COUSIN PALAMON QUOTH HE
THINE IS THE VICT'RY OF THIS AVENTURE
FULL BLISSFULLY IN PRISON TO ENDURE
IN PRISON NAY CERTES IN PARADISE
WELL HATH FORTUNE Y TURNED THEE THE DICE
THAT HAST THE SIGHT OF HER AND I TH' ABSENCE
FOR POSSIBLE IS SINCE THOU HAST HER PRESENCE
AND ART A KNIGHT A WORTHY AND AN ABLE
THAT BY SOME CAS SINCE FORTUNE IS CHANGEABLE CHANCE
THOU MAY'ST TO THY DESIRE SOMETIME ATTAIN
BUT I THAT AM EXILED AND BARREN
OF ALLE GRACE AND IN SO GREAT DESPAIR
THAT THERE N'IS EARTHE WATER FIRE NOR AIR
NOR CREATURE THAT OF THEM MAKED IS
THAT MAY ME HELPE NOR COMFORT IN THIS
WELL OUGHT I STERVE IN WANHOPE AND DISTRESS
DIE IN DESPAIR
FAREWELL MY LIFE MY LUST AND MY GLADNESS
PLEASURE
ALAS WHY PLAINEN MEN SO IN COMMUNE WHY DO MEN SO OFTEN COMPLAIN
OF PURVEYANCE OF GOD OR OF FORTUNE OF GOD'S PROVIDENCE
THAT GIVETH THEM FULL OFT IN MANY A GUISE
WELL BETTER THAN THEY CAN THEMSELVES DEVISE
SOME MAN DESIRETH FOR TO HAVE RICHESS
THAT CAUSE IS OF HIS MURDER OR GREAT SICKNESS
AND SOME MAN WOULD OUT OF HIS PRISON FAIN
THAT IN HIS HOUSE IS OF HIS MEINIE SLAIN
SERVANTS 16
INFINITE HARMES BE IN THIS MATTERE
WE WOT NEVER WHAT THING WE PRAY FOR HERE
WE FARE AS HE THAT DRUNK IS AS A MOUSE
A DRUNKEN MAN WOT WELL HE HATH AN HOUSE
BUT HE WOT NOT WHICH IS THE RIGHT WAY THITHER
AND TO A DRUNKEN MAN THE WAY IS SLITHER
SLIPPERY
AND CERTES IN THIS WORLD SO FARE WE
WE SEEKE FAST AFTER FELICITY
BUT WE GO WRONG FULL OFTEN TRUELY
THUS WE MAY SAYEN ALL AND NAMELY I ESPECIALLY
THAT WEEN'D AND HAD A GREAT OPINION THOUGHT
THAT IF I MIGHT ESCAPE FROM PRISON
THEN HAD I BEEN IN JOY AND PERFECT HEAL
WHERE NOW I AM EXILED FROM MY WEAL
SINCE THAT I MAY NOT SEE YOU EMILY
I AM BUT DEAD THERE IS NO REMEDY
UPON THAT OTHER SIDE PALAMON
WHEN THAT HE WIST ARCITA WAS AGONE
MUCH SORROW MAKETH THAT THE GREATE TOWER
RESOUNDED OF HIS YELLING AND CLAMOUR
THE PURE FETTERS ON HIS SHINNES GREAT VERY 17
WERE OF HIS BITTER SALTE TEARES WET
ALAS QUOTH HE ARCITA COUSIN MINE
OF ALL OUR STRIFE GOD WOT THE FRUIT IS THINE
THOU WALKEST NOW IN THEBES AT THY LARGE
AND OF MY WOE THOU GIVEST LITTLE CHARGE
TAKEST LITTLE HEED
THOU MAYST SINCE THOU HAST WISDOM AND MANHEAD MANHOOD COURAGE
ASSEMBLE ALL THE FOLK OF OUR KINDRED
AND MAKE A WAR SO SHARP ON THIS COUNTRY
THAT BY SOME AVENTURE OR SOME TREATY
THOU MAYST HAVE HER TO LADY AND TO WIFE
FOR WHOM THAT I MUST NEEDES LOSE MY LIFE
FOR AS BY WAY OF POSSIBILITY
SINCE THOU ART AT THY LARGE OF PRISON FREE
AND ART A LORD GREAT IS THINE AVANTAGE
MORE THAN IS MINE THAT STERVE HERE IN A CAGE
FOR I MUST WEEP AND WAIL WHILE THAT I LIVE
WITH ALL THE WOE THAT PRISON MAY ME GIVE
AND EKE WITH PAIN THAT LOVE ME GIVES ALSO
THAT DOUBLES ALL MY TORMENT AND MY WOE
THEREWITH THE FIRE OF JEALOUSY UPSTART
WITHIN HIS BREAST AND HENT HIM BY THE HEART SEIZED
SO WOODLY THAT HE LIKE WAS TO BEHOLD MADLY
THE BOX TREE OR THE ASHES DEAD AND COLD
THEN SAID O CRUEL GODDESS THAT GOVERN
THIS WORLD WITH BINDING OF YOUR WORD ETERN ETERNAL
AND WRITEN IN THE TABLE OF ADAMANT
YOUR PARLEMENT AND YOUR ETERNAL GRANT CONSULTATION
WHAT IS MANKIND MORE UNTO YOU Y HOLD BY YOU ESTEEMED
THAN IS THE SHEEP THAT ROUKETH IN THE FOLD LIE HUDDLED TOGETHER
FOR SLAIN IS MAN RIGHT AS ANOTHER BEAST
AND DWELLETH EKE IN PRISON AND ARREST
AND HATH SICKNESS AND GREAT ADVERSITY
AND OFTENTIMES GUILTELESS PARDIE BY GOD
WHAT GOVERNANCE IS IN YOUR PRESCIENCE
THAT GUILTELESS TORMENTETH INNOCENCE
AND YET INCREASETH THIS ALL MY PENANCE
THAT MAN IS BOUNDEN TO HIS OBSERVANCE
FOR GODDE'S SAKE TO LETTEN OF HIS WILL RESTRAIN HIS DESIRE
WHEREAS A BEAST MAY ALL HIS LUST FULFIL
AND WHEN A BEAST IS DEAD HE HATH NO PAIN
BUT MAN AFTER HIS DEATH MUST WEEP AND PLAIN
THOUGH IN THIS WORLDE HE HAVE CARE AND WOE
WITHOUTE DOUBT IT MAYE STANDEN SO
THE ANSWER OF THIS LEAVE I TO DIVINES
BUT WELL I WOT THAT IN THIS WORLD GREAT PINE IS PAIN TROUBLE
ALAS I SEE A SERPENT OR A THIEF
THAT MANY A TRUE MAN HATH DONE MISCHIEF
GO AT HIS LARGE AND WHERE HIM LIST MAY TURN
BUT I MUST BE IN PRISON THROUGH SATURN
AND EKE THROUGH JUNO JEALOUS AND EKE WOOD MAD
THAT HATH WELL NIGH DESTROYED ALL THE BLOOD
OF THEBES WITH HIS WASTE WALLES WIDE
AND VENUS SLAY'TH ME ON THAT OTHER SIDE
FOR JEALOUSY AND FEAR OF HIM ARCITE
NOW WILL I STENT OF PALAMON A LITE PAUSE LITTLE
AND LET HIM IN HIS PRISON STILLE DWELL
AND OF ARCITA FORTH I WILL YOU TELL
THE SUMMER PASSETH AND THE NIGHTES LONG
INCREASE DOUBLE WISE THE PAINES STRONG
BOTH OF THE LOVER AND THE PRISONERE
I N'OT WHICH HATH THE WOFULLER MISTERE
KNOW NOT CONDITION
FOR SHORTLY FOR TO SAY THIS PALAMON
PERPETUALLY IS DAMNED TO PRISON
IN CHAINES AND IN FETTERS TO BE DEAD
AND ARCITE IS EXILED ON HIS HEAD ON PERIL OF HIS HEAD
FOR EVERMORE AS OUT OF THAT COUNTRY
NOR NEVER MORE HE SHALL HIS LADY SEE
YOU LOVERS ASK I NOW THIS QUESTION 18
WHO LIETH THE WORSE ARCITE OR PALAMON
THE ONE MAY SEE HIS LADY DAY BY DAY
BUT IN PRISON HE DWELLE MUST ALWAY
THE OTHER WHERE HIM LIST MAY RIDE OR GO
BUT SEE HIS LADY SHALL HE NEVER MO'
NOW DEEM ALL AS YOU LISTE YE THAT CAN
FOR I WILL TELL YOU FORTH AS I BEGAN
WHEN THAT ARCITE TO THEBES COMEN WAS
FULL OFT A DAY HE SWELT AND SAID ALAS FAINTED
FOR SEE THIS LADY HE SHALL NEVER MO'
AND SHORTLY TO CONCLUDEN ALL HIS WOE
SO MUCH SORROW HAD NEVER CREATURE
THAT IS OR SHALL BE WHILE THE WORLD MAY DURE
HIS SLEEP HIS MEAT HIS DRINK IS HIM BYRAFT TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM
THAT LEAN HE WEX AND DRY AS ANY SHAFT
BECAME
HIS EYEN HOLLOW GRISLY TO BEHOLD
HIS HUE SALLOW AND PALE AS ASHES COLD
AND SOLITARY HE WAS EVER ALONE
AND WAILING ALL THE NIGHT MAKING HIS MOAN
AND IF HE HEARDE SONG OR INSTRUMENT
THEN WOULD HE WEEPEN HE MIGHT NOT BE STENT
STOPPED
SO FEEBLE WERE HIS SPIRITS AND SO LOW
AND CHANGED SO THAT NO MAN COULDE KNOW
HIS SPEECH NEITHER HIS VOICE THOUGH MEN IT HEARD
AND IN HIS GEAR FOR ALL THE WORLD HE FAR'D BEHAVIOUR 19
NOT ONLY LIKE THE LOVERS' MALADY
OF EROS BUT RATHER Y LIKE MANIE MADNESS
ENGENDER'D OF HUMOURS MELANCHOLIC
BEFORE HIS HEAD IN HIS CELL FANTASTIC 20
AND SHORTLY TURNED WAS ALL UPSIDE DOWN
BOTH HABIT AND EKE DISPOSITIOUN
OF HIM THIS WOFUL LOVER DAN ARCITE
LORD 21
WHY SHOULD I ALL DAY OF HIS WOE INDITE
WHEN HE ENDURED HAD A YEAR OR TWO
THIS CRUEL TORMENT AND THIS PAIN AND WOE
AT THEBES IN HIS COUNTRY AS I SAID
UPON A NIGHT IN SLEEP AS HE HIM LAID
HIM THOUGHT HOW THAT THE WINGED GOD MERCURY
BEFORE HIM STOOD AND BADE HIM TO BE MERRY
HIS SLEEPY YARD IN HAND HE BARE UPRIGHT ROD 22
A HAT HE WORE UPON HIS HAIRES BRIGHT
ARRAYED WAS THIS GOD AS HE TOOK KEEP NOTICE
AS HE WAS WHEN THAT ARGUS 23 TOOK HIS SLEEP
AND SAID HIM THUS TO ATHENS SHALT THOU WEND GO
THERE IS THEE SHAPEN OF THY WOE AN END FIXED PREPARED
AND WITH THAT WORD ARCITE WOKE AND START
NOW TRUELY HOW SORE THAT E'ER ME SMART
QUOTH HE TO ATHENS RIGHT NOW WILL I FARE
NOR FOR NO DREAD OF DEATH SHALL I NOT SPARE
TO SEE MY LADY THAT I LOVE AND SERVE
IN HER PRESENCE I RECKE NOT TO STERVE DO NOT CARE IF I DIE
AND WITH THAT WORD HE CAUGHT A GREAT MIRROR
AND SAW THAT CHANGED WAS ALL HIS COLOUR
AND SAW HIS VISAGE ALL IN OTHER KIND
AND RIGHT ANON IT RAN HIM ILL HIS MIND
THAT SINCE HIS FACE WAS SO DISFIGUR'D
OF MALADY THE WHICH HE HAD ENDUR'D
HE MIGHTE WELL IF THAT HE BARE HIM LOW LIVED IN LOWLY FASHION
LIVE IN ATHENES EVERMORE UNKNOW
AND SEE HIS LADY WELLNIGH DAY BY DAY
AND RIGHT ANON HE CHANGED HIS ARRAY
AND CLAD HIM AS A POORE LABOURER
AND ALL ALONE SAVE ONLY A SQUIER
THAT KNEW HIS PRIVITY AND ALL HIS CAS SECRETS FORTUNE
WHICH WAS DISGUISED POORLY AS HE WAS
TO ATHENS IS HE GONE THE NEXTE WAY
NEAREST 24
AND TO THE COURT HE WENT UPON A DAY
AND AT THE GATE HE PROFFER'D HIS SERVICE
TO DRUDGE AND DRAW WHAT SO MEN WOULD DEVISE
ORDER
AND SHORTLY OF THIS MATTER FOR TO SAYN
HE FELL IN OFFICE WITH A CHAMBERLAIN
THE WHICH THAT DWELLING WAS WITH EMILY
FOR HE WAS WISE AND COULDE SOON ESPY
OF EVERY SERVANT WHICH THAT SERVED HER
WELL COULD HE HEWE WOOD AND WATER BEAR
FOR HE WAS YOUNG AND MIGHTY FOR THE NONES OCCASION
AND THERETO HE WAS STRONG AND BIG OF BONES
TO DO THAT ANY WIGHT CAN HIM DEVISE
A YEAR OR TWO HE WAS IN THIS SERVICE
PAGE OF THE CHAMBER OF EMILY THE BRIGHT
AND PHILOSTRATE HE SAIDE THAT HE HIGHT
BUT HALF SO WELL BELOV'D A MAN AS HE
NE WAS THERE NEVER IN COURT OF HIS DEGREE
HE WAS SO GENTLE OF CONDITIOUN
THAT THROUGHOUT ALL THE COURT WAS HIS RENOWN
THEY SAIDE THAT IT WERE A CHARITY
THAT THESEUS WOULD ENHANCE HIS DEGREE ELEVATE HIM IN RANK
AND PUT HIM IN SOME WORSHIPFUL SERVICE
THERE AS HE MIGHT HIS VIRTUE EXERCISE
AND THUS WITHIN A WHILE HIS NAME SPRUNG
BOTH OF HIS DEEDES AND OF HIS GOOD TONGUE
THAT THESEUS HATH TAKEN HIM SO NEAR
THAT OF HIS CHAMBER HE HATH MADE HIM SQUIRE
AND GAVE HIM GOLD TO MAINTAIN HIS DEGREE
AND EKE MEN BROUGHT HIM OUT OF HIS COUNTRY
FROM YEAR TO YEAR FULL PRIVILY HIS RENT
BUT HONESTLY AND SLYLY HE IT SPENT DISCREETLY PRUDENTLY
THAT NO MAN WONDER'D HOW THAT HE IT HAD
AND THREE YEAR IN THIS WISE HIS LIFE BE LAD LED
AND BARE HIM SO IN PEACE AND EKE IN WERRE WAR
THERE WAS NO MAN THAT THESEUS HAD SO DERRE
DEAR
AND IN THIS BLISSE LEAVE I NOW ARCITE
AND SPEAK I WILL OF PALAMON A LITE
LITTLE
IN DARKNESS HORRIBLE AND STRONG PRISON
THIS SEVEN YEAR HATH SITTEN PALAMON
FORPINED WHAT FOR LOVE AND FOR DISTRESS
PINED WASTED AWAY
WHO FEELETH DOUBLE SORROW AND HEAVINESS
BUT PALAMON THAT LOVE DISTRAINETH SO AFFLICTS
THAT WOOD OUT OF HIS WITS HE WENT FOR WOE MAD
AND EKE THERETO HE IS A PRISONERE
PERPETUAL NOT ONLY FOR A YEAR
WHO COULDE RHYME IN ENGLISH PROPERLY
HIS MARTYRDOM FORSOOTH IT IS NOT I TRULY
THEREFORE I PASS AS LIGHTLY AS I MAY
IT FELL THAT IN THE SEVENTH YEAR IN MAY
THE THIRDE NIGHT AS OLDE BOOKES SAYN
THAT ALL THIS STORY TELLEN MORE PLAIN
WERE IT BY A VENTURE OR DESTINY
AS WHEN A THING IS SHAPEN IT SHALL BE SETTLED DECREED
THAT SOON AFTER THE MIDNIGHT PALAMON
BY HELPING OF A FRIEND BRAKE HIS PRISON
AND FLED THE CITY FAST AS HE MIGHT GO
FOR HE HAD GIVEN DRINK HIS GAOLER SO
OF A CLARY 25 MADE OF A CERTAIN WINE
WITH NARCOTISE AND OPIE OF THEBES FINE NARCOTICS AND OPIUM
THAT ALL THE NIGHT THOUGH THAT MEN WOULD HIM SHAKE
THE GAOLER SLEPT HE MIGHTE NOT AWAKE
AND THUS HE FLED AS FAST AS EVER HE MAY
THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND FASTE BY THE DAY CLOSE AT HAND WAS
THAT NEEDES CAST HE MUST HIMSELF TO HIDE
THE DAY DURING WHICH
AND TO A GROVE FASTE THERE BESIDE HE MUST CAST ABOUT OR CONTRIVE
WITH DREADFUL FOOT THEN STALKED PALAMON
TO CONCEAL HIMSELF
FOR SHORTLY THIS WAS HIS OPINION
THAT IN THE GROVE HE WOULD HIM HIDE ALL DAY
AND IN THE NIGHT THEN WOULD HE TAKE HIS WAY
TO THEBES WARD HIS FRIENDES FOR TO PRAY
ON THESEUS TO HELP HIM TO WARRAY
MAKE WAR 26
AND SHORTLY EITHER HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE
OR WINNEN EMILY UNTO HIS WIFE
THIS IS TH' EFFECT AND HIS INTENTION PLAIN
NOW WILL I TURN TO ARCITA AGAIN
THAT LITTLE WIST HOW NIGHE WAS HIS CARE
TILL THAT FORTUNE HAD BROUGHT HIM IN THE SNARE
THE BUSY LARK THE MESSENGER OF DAY
SALUTETH IN HER SONG THE MORNING GRAY
AND FIERY PHOEBUS RISETH UP SO BRIGHT
THAT ALL THE ORIENT LAUGHETH AT THE SIGHT
AND WITH HIS STREAMES DRIETH IN THE GREVES RAYS GROVES
THE SILVER DROPPES HANGING ON THE LEAVES
AND ARCITE THAT IS IN THE COURT ROYAL
WITH THESEUS HIS SQUIER PRINCIPAL
IS RIS'N AND LOOKETH ON THE MERRY DAY
AND FOR TO DO HIS OBSERVANCE TO MAY
REMEMBERING THE POINT OF HIS DESIRE OBJECT
HE ON HIS COURSER STARTING AS THE FIRE
IS RIDDEN TO THE FIELDES HIM TO PLAY
OUT OF THE COURT WERE IT A MILE OR TWAY
AND TO THE GROVE OF WHICH I HAVE YOU TOLD
BY A VENTURE HIS WAY BEGAN TO HOLD
TO MAKE HIM A GARLAND OF THE GREVES GROVES
WERE IT OF WOODBINE OR OF HAWTHORN LEAVES
AND LOUD HE SANG AGAINST THE SUN SO SHEEN
SHINING BRIGHT
O MAY WITH ALL THY FLOWERS AND THY GREEN
RIGHT WELCOME BE THOU FAIRE FRESHE MAY
I HOPE THAT I SOME GREEN HERE GETTEN MAY
AND FROM HIS COURSER WITH A LUSTY HEART HORSE
INTO THE GROVE FULL HASTILY HE START
AND IN A PATH HE ROAMED UP AND DOWN
THERE AS BY AVENTURE THIS PALAMON
WAS IN A BUSH THAT NO MAN MIGHT HIM SEE
FOR SORE AFEARD OF HIS DEATH WAS HE
NOTHING NE KNEW HE THAT IT WAS ARCITE
GOD WOT HE WOULD HAVE TROWED IT FULL LITE
FULL LITTLE BELIEVED IT
BUT SOOTH IS SAID GONE SINCE FULL MANY YEARS
THE FIELD HATH EYEN AND THE WOOD HATH EARS EYES
IT IS FULL FAIR A MAN TO BEAR HIM EVEN TO BE ON HIS GUARD
FOR ALL DAY MEETEN MEN AT UNSET STEVEN
UNEXPECTED TIME 27
FULL LITTLE WOT ARCITE OF HIS FELLAW
THAT WAS SO NIGH TO HEARKEN OF HIS SAW SAYING SPEECH
FOR IN THE BUSH HE SITTETH NOW FULL STILL
WHEN THAT ARCITE HAD ROAMED ALL HIS FILL
AND SUNGEN ALL THE ROUNDEL LUSTILY SANG THE ROUNDELAY 28
INTO A STUDY HE FELL SUDDENLY
AS DO THOSE LOVERS IN THEIR QUAINTE GEARS ODD FASHIONS
NOW IN THE CROP AND NOW DOWN IN THE BRERES 29 TREE TOP
NOW UP NOW DOWN AS BUCKET IN A WELL
BRIARS
RIGHT AS THE FRIDAY SOOTHLY FOR TO TELL

RIGHT SO CAN GEARY VENUS OVERCAST CHANGEFUL
THE HEARTES OF HER FOLK RIGHT AS HER DAY

WHEN ARCITE HAD Y SUNG HE GAN TO SIKE SIGH
AND SAT HIM DOWN WITHOUTEN ANY MORE
ALAS QUOTH HE THE DAY THAT I WAS BORE

AND OF THE CITY FIRST WAS CROWNED KING
OF HIS LINEAGE AM I AND HIS OFFSPRING
BY VERY LINE AS OF THE STOCK ROYAL
AND NOW I AM SO CAITIFF AND SO THRALL WRETCHED AND ENSLAVED
THAT HE THAT IS MY MORTAL ENEMY
I SERVE HIM AS HIS SQUIER POORELY
AND YET DOTH JUNO ME WELL MORE SHAME
FOR I DARE NOT BEKNOW MINE OWEN NAME ACKNOWLEDGE 30

A LONGE TIME AND AFTERWARD UPSTART
THIS PALAMON THAT THOUGHT THOROUGH HIS HEART
HE FELT A COLD SWORD SUDDENLY TO GLIDE
FOR IRE HE QUOKE NO LONGER WOULD HE HIDE

CHOOSE WHICH THOU WILT FOR THOU SHALT NOT ASTART
THIS ARCITE THEN WITH FULL DISPITEOUS HEART WRATHFUL
WHEN HE HIM KNEW AND HAD HIS TALE HEARD

THIS PALAMON ANSWER'D I GRANT IT THEE
AND THUS THEY BE DEPARTED TILL THE MORROW
WHEN EACH OF THEM HATH LAID HIS FAITH TO BORROW
PLEDGED HIS FAITH

O REGNE THAT WILT NO FELLOW HAVE WITH THEE QUEEN 32
FULL SOOTH IS SAID THAT LOVE NOR LORDESHIP

THANKS TO HIM
WELL FINDEN THAT ARCITE AND PALAMON
ARCITE IS RIDD ANON UNTO THE TOWN
AND ON THE MORROW ERE IT WERE DAYLIGHT
FULL PRIVILY TWO HARNESS HATH HE DIGHT PREPARED
BOTH SUFFISANT AND MEETE TO DARRAINE CONTEST
THE BATTLE IN THE FIELD BETWIXT THEM TWAIN
AND ON HIS HORSE ALONE AS HE WAS BORN
HE CARRIETH ALL THIS HARNESS HIM BEFORN
AND IN THE GROVE AT TIME AND PLACE Y SET
THIS ARCITE AND THIS PALAMON BE MET
THEN CHANGE GAN THE COLOUR OF THEIR FACE
RIGHT AS THE HUNTER IN THE REGNE OF THRACE KINGDOM
THAT STANDETH AT A GAPPE WITH A SPEAR
WHEN HUNTED IS THE LION OR THE BEAR
AND HEARETH HIM COME RUSHING IN THE GREVES GROVES
AND BREAKING BOTH THE BOUGHES AND THE LEAVES
THINKETH HERE COMES MY MORTAL ENEMY
WITHOUTE FAIL HE MUST BE DEAD OR I
FOR EITHER I MUST SLAY HIM AT THE GAP

AND IN THIS WISE I LET THEM FIGHTING DWELL
AND FORTH I WILL OF THESEUS YOU TELL
THE DESTINY MINISTER GENERAL

BEGAN TO WEEP AND SO DID EMILY

GREAT PITY WAS IT AS IT THOUGHT THEM ALL
THAT EVER SUCH A CHANCE SHOULD BEFALL
FOR GENTLE MEN THEY WERE OF GREAT ESTATE
AND NOTHING BUT FOR LOVE WAS THIS DEBATE
THEY SAW THEIR BLOODY WOUNDES WIDE AND SORE
AND CRIED ALL AT ONCE BOTH LESS AND MORE
HAVE MERCY LORD UPON US WOMEN ALL
AND ON THEIR BARE KNEES ADOWN THEY FALL
AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS FEET THERE AS HE STOOD
TILL AT THE LAST ASLAKED WAS HIS MOOD HIS ANGER WAS

AND EKE DELIVER HIMSELF OUT OF PRISON
OF WOMEN FOR THEY WEPTEN EVER IN ONE CONTINUALLY
AND EKE HIS HEARTE HAD COMPASSION
AND IN HIS GENTLE HEART HE THOUGHT ANON
AND SOFT UNTO HIMSELF HE SAIDE FIE
UPON A LORD THAT WILL HAVE NO MERCY
BUT BE A LION BOTH IN WORD AND DEED
TO THEM THAT BE IN REPENTANCE AND DREAD
AS WELL AS TO A PROUD DISPITEOUS MAN UNPITYING
THAT WILL MAINTAINE WHAT HE FIRST BEGAN
THAT LORD HATH LITTLE OF DISCRETION

BUT WEIGHETH PRIDE AND HUMBLESS AFTER ONE ALIKE
AND SHORTLY WHEN HIS IRE IS THUS AGONE

AND SPAKE THESE SAME WORDES ALL ON HEIGHT ALOUD
THE GOD OF LOVE AH BENEDICITE BLESS YE HIM
HOW MIGHTY AND HOW GREAT A LORD IS HE

SHE WOT NO MORE OF ALL THIS HOTE FARE HOT BEHAVIOUR
BY GOD THAN WOT A CUCKOO OR AN HARE
BUT ALL MUST BE ASSAYED HOT OR COLD

FOR IN MY TIME A SERVANT WAS I ONE
AND THEREFORE SINCE I KNOW OF LOVE'S PAIN

THE JOYE THAT IS MAKED IN THE PLACE
WHEN THESEUS HATH DONE SO FAIR A GRACE
BUT DOWN ON KNEES WENT EVERY MANNER WIGHT KIND OF PERSON
AND THANKED HIM WITH ALL THEIR HEARTES' MIGHT
AND NAMELY THESE THEBANS OFTE SITHE
ESPECIALLY OFTENTIMES
AND THUS WITH GOOD HOPE AND WITH HEARTE BLITHE
THEY TAKE THEIR LEAVE AND HOMEWARD GAN THEY RIDE
TO THEBES WARD WITH HIS OLD WALLES WIDE
I TROW MEN WOULDE DEEM IT NEGLIGENCE
IF I FORGOT TO TELLE THE DISPENCE EXPENDITURE
OF THESEUS THAT WENT SO BUSILY
TO MAKEN UP THE LISTES ROYALLY
THAT SUCH A NOBLE THEATRE AS IT WAS
I DARE WELL SAY IN ALL THIS WORLD THERE N'AS
WAS NOT
THE CIRCUIT A MILE WAS ABOUT
WALLED OF STONE AND DITCHED ALL WITHOUT
ROUND WAS THE SHAPE IN MANNER OF COMPASS
FULL OF DEGREES THE HEIGHT OF SIXTY PAS SEE NOTE 39
THAT WHEN A MAN WAS SET ON ONE DEGREE
HE LETTED NOT HIS FELLOW FOR TO SEE
HINDERED
EASTWARD THERE STOOD A GATE OF MARBLE WHITE
WESTWARD RIGHT SUCH ANOTHER OPPOSITE
AND SHORTLY TO CONCLUDE SUCH A PLACE
WAS NEVER ON EARTH MADE IN SO LITTLE SPACE
FOR IN THE LAND THERE WAS NO CRAFTES MAN
THAT GEOMETRY OR ARSMETRIKE CAN ARITHMETIC KNEW
NOR POURTRAYOR NOR CARVER OF IMAGES PORTRAIT PAINTER
THAT THESEUS NE GAVE HIM MEAT AND WAGES
THE THEATRE TO MAKE AND TO DEVISE
AND FOR TO DO HIS RITE AND SACRIFICE
HE EASTWARD HATH UPON THE GATE ABOVE
IN WORSHIP OF VENUS GODDESS OF LOVE
DONE MAKE AN ALTAR AND AN ORATORY CAUSED TO BE MADE
AND WESTWARD IN THE MIND AND IN MEMORY
OF MARS HE MAKED HATH RIGHT SUCH ANOTHER
THAT COSTE LARGELY OF GOLD A FOTHER
A GREAT AMOUNT
AND NORTHWARD IN A TURRET ON THE WALL
OF ALABASTER WHITE AND RED CORAL
AN ORATORY RICHE FOR TO SEE
IN WORSHIP OF DIANE OF CHASTITY
HATH THESEUS DONE WORK IN NOBLE WISE
BUT YET HAD I FORGOTTEN TO DEVISE DESCRIBE
THE NOBLE CARVING AND THE PORTRAITURES
THE SHAPE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE FIGURES
THAT WEREN IN THERE ORATORIES THREE
FIRST IN THE TEMPLE OF VENUS MAY'ST THOU SEE
WROUGHT ON THE WALL FULL PITEOUS TO BEHOLD
THE BROKEN SLEEPES AND THE SIKES COLD SIGHES
THE SACRED TEARES AND THE WAIMENTINGS LAMENTINGS
THE FIERY STROKES OF THE DESIRINGS
THAT LOVE'S SERVANTS IN THIS LIFE ENDURE
THE OATHES THAT THEIR COVENANTS ASSURE
PLEASANCE AND HOPE DESIRE FOOLHARDINESS
BEAUTY AND YOUTH AND BAWDRY AND RICHESS
CHARMS AND SORC'RY LEASINGS AND FLATTERY FALSEHOODS
DISPENCE BUSINESS AND JEALOUSY
THAT WORE OF YELLOW GOLDES A GARLAND SUNFLOWERS 40
AND HAD A CUCKOO SITTING ON HER HAND
FEASTS INSTRUMENTS AND CAROLES AND DANCES
LUST AND ARRAY AND ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF LOVE WHICH I RECKON'D AND RECKON SHALL
IN ORDER WERE PAINTED ON THE WALL
AND MORE THAN I CAN MAKE OF MENTION
FOR SOOTHLY ALL THE MOUNT OF CITHERON 41
WHERE VENUS HATH HER PRINCIPAL DWELLING
WAS SHOWED ON THE WALL IN POURTRAYING
WITH ALL THE GARDEN AND THE LUSTINESS
PLEASANTNESS
NOR WAS FORGOT THE PORTER IDLENESS
NOR NARCISSUS THE FAIR OF YORE AGONE OLDEN TIMES
NOR YET THE FOLLY OF KING SOLOMON
NOR YET THE GREATE STRENGTH OF HERCULES
TH' ENCHANTMENTS OF MEDEA AND CIRCES
NOR OF TURNUS THE HARDY FIERCE COURAGE
THE RICH CROESUS CAITIF IN SERVAGE 42 ABASED INTO SLAVERY
THUS MAY YE SEE THAT WISDOM NOR RICHESS
BEAUTY NOR SLEIGHT NOR STRENGTH NOR HARDINESS
NE MAY WITH VENUS HOLDE CHAMPARTIE DIVIDED POSSESSION 43
FOR AS HER LISTE THE WORLD MAY SHE GIE
GUIDE
LO ALL THESE FOLK SO CAUGHT WERE IN HER LAS SNARE
TILL THEY FOR WOE FULL OFTEN SAID ALAS
SUFFICE THESE ENSAMPLES ONE OR TWO
ALTHOUGH I COULD RECKON A THOUSAND MO'
THE STATUE OF VENUS GLORIOUS TO SEE
WAS NAKED FLOATING IN THE LARGE SEA
AND FROM THE NAVEL DOWN ALL COVER'D WAS
WITH WAVES GREEN AND BRIGHT AS ANY GLASS
A CITOLE 44 IN HER RIGHT HAND HADDE SHE
AND ON HER HEAD FULL SEEMLY FOR TO SEE
A ROSE GARLAND FRESH AND WELL SMELLING
ABOVE HER HEAD HER DOVES FLICKERING
BEFORE HER STOOD HER SONE CUPIDO
UPON HIS SHOULDERS WINGES HAD HE TWO
AND BLIND HE WAS AS IT IS OFTEN SEEN
A BOW HE BARE AND ARROWS BRIGHT AND KEEN
WHY SHOULD I NOT AS WELL EKE TELL YOU ALL
THE PORTRAITURE THAT WAS UPON THE WALL
WITHIN THE TEMPLE OF MIGHTY MARS THE RED
ALL PAINTED WAS THE WALL IN LENGTH AND BREDE BREADTH
LIKE TO THE ESTRES OF THE GRISLY PLACE INTERIOR CHAMBERS
THAT HIGHT THE GREAT TEMPLE OF MARS IN THRACE
IN THILKE COLD AND FROSTY REGION THAT
THERE AS MARS HATH HIS SOVEREIGN MANSION
IN WHICH THERE DWELLED NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST
WITH KNOTTY GNARRY BARREN TREES OLD GNARLED
OF STUBBES SHARP AND HIDEOUS TO BEHOLD
IN WHICH THERE RAN A RUMBLE AND A SOUGH GROANING NOISE
AS THOUGH A STORM SHOULD BURSTEN EVERY BOUGH
AND DOWNWARD FROM AN HILL UNDER A BENT SLOPE
THERE STOOD THE TEMPLE OF MARS ARMIPOTENT
WROUGHT ALL OF BURNISH'D STEEL OF WHICH TH' ENTRY
WAS LONG AND STRAIT AND GHASTLY FOR TO SEE
AND THEREOUT CAME A RAGE AND SUCH A VISE SUCH A FURIOUS VOICE
THAT IT MADE ALL THE GATES FOR TO RISE
THE NORTHERN LIGHT IN AT THE DOORE SHONE
FOR WINDOW ON THE WALLE WAS THERE NONE
THROUGH WHICH MEN MIGHTEN ANY LIGHT DISCERN
THE DOORS WERE ALL OF ADAMANT ETERN
Y CLENCHED OVERTHWART AND ENDE LONG CROSSWAYS AND LENGTHWAYS
WITH IRON TOUGH AND FOR TO MAKE IT STRONG
EVERY PILLAR THE TEMPLE TO SUSTAIN
WAS TUNNE GREAT OF IRON BRIGHT AND SHEEN
THICK AS A TUN BARREL
THERE SAW I FIRST THE DARK IMAGINING
OF FELONY AND ALL THE COMPASSING
THE CRUEL IRE AS RED AS ANY GLEDE LIVE COAL
THE PICKE PURSE 45 AND EKE THE PALE DREAD
THE SMILER WITH THE KNIFE UNDER THE CLOAK
THE SHEPEN BURNING WITH THE BLACKE SMOKE STABLE 46
THE TREASON OF THE MURD'RING IN THE BED
THE OPEN WAR WITH WOUNDES ALL BE BLED
CONTEKE WITH BLOODY KNIFE AND SHARP MENACE
CONTENTION DISCORD
ALL FULL OF CHIRKING WAS THAT SORRY PLACE
CREAKING JARRING NOISE
THE SLAYER OF HIMSELF EKE SAW I THERE
HIS HEARTE BLOOD HAD BATHED ALL HIS HAIR
THE NAIL Y DRIVEN IN THE SHODE AT NIGHT HAIR OF THE HEAD 47
THE COLDE DEATH WITH MOUTH GAPING UPRIGHT
AMIDDES OF THE TEMPLE SAT MISCHANCE
WITH DISCOMFORT AND SORRY COUNTENANCE
EKE SAW I WOODNESS LAUGHING IN HIS RAGE MADNESS
ARMED COMPLAINT OUTHEES AND FIERCE OUTRAGE OUTCRY
THE CARRAIN IN THE BUSH WITH THROAT Y CORVE CORPSE SLASHED
A THOUSAND SLAIN AND NOT OF QUALM Y STORVE DEAD OF SICKNESS
THE TYRANT WITH THE PREY BY FORCE Y REFT
THE TOWN DESTROY'D THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT
YET SAW I BRENT THE SHIPPES HOPPESTERES 48 BURNT
THE HUNTER STRANGLED WITH THE WILDE BEARS
THE SOW FRETING THE CHILD RIGHT IN THE CRADLE DEVOURING 49
THE COOK SCALDED FOR ALL HIS LONGE LADLE
NOR WAS FORGOT BY TH'INFORTUNE OF MART THROUGH THE MISFORTUNE
THE CARTER OVERRIDDEN WITH HIS CART OF WAR
UNDER THE WHEEL FULL LOW HE LAY ADOWN
THERE WERE ALSO OF MARS' DIVISION
THE ARMOURER THE BOWYER AND THE SMITH MAKER OF BOWS
THAT FORGETH SHARP SWORDES ON HIS STITH
ANVIL
AND ALL ABOVE DEPAINTED IN A TOWER
SAW I CONQUEST SITTING IN GREAT HONOUR
WITH THILKE SHARPE SWORD OVER HIS HEAD THAT
HANGING BY A SUBTLE Y TWINED THREAD
PAINTED THE SLAUGHTER WAS OF JULIUS 50
OF CRUEL NERO AND ANTONIUS
ALTHOUGH AT THAT TIME THEY WERE YET UNBORN
YET WAS THEIR DEATH DEPAINTED THERE BEFORN
BY MENACING OF MARS RIGHT BY FIGURE
SO WAS IT SHOWED IN THAT PORTRAITURE
AS IS DEPAINTED IN THE STARS ABOVE
WHO SHALL BE SLAIN OR ELLES DEAD FOR LOVE
SUFFICETH ONE ENSAMPLE IN STORIES OLD
I MAY NOT RECKON THEM ALL THOUGH I WO'LD
THE STATUE OF MARS UPON A CARTE STOOD CHARIOT
ARMED AND LOOKED GRIM AS HE WERE WOOD MAD
AND OVER HIS HEAD THERE SHONE TWO FIGURES
OF STARRES THAT BE CLEPED IN SCRIPTURES
THAT ONE PUELLA THAT OTHER RUBEUS

THIS GOD OF ARMES WAS ARRAYED THUS
A WOLF THERE STOOD BEFORE HIM AT HIS FEET
WITH EYEN RED AND OF A MAN HE EAT
WITH SUBTLE PENCIL PAINTED WAS THIS STORY
IN REDOUTING OF MARS AND OF HIS GLORY

NOW TO THE TEMPLE OF DIAN THE CHASTE
AS SHORTLY AS I CAN I WILL ME HASTE
TO TELLE YOU ALL THE DESCRIPTIOUN
DEPAINTED BE THE WALLES UP AND DOWN
OF HUNTING AND OF SHAMEFAST CHASTITY
THERE SAW I HOW WOFUL CALISTOPE 52
WHEN THAT DIAN AGGRIEVED WAS WITH HER
WAS TURNED FROM A WOMAN TO A BEAR
AND AFTER WAS SHE MADE THE LODESTAR POLE STAR
THUS WAS IT PAINTED I CAN SAY NO FAR FARTHER
HER SON IS EKE A STAR AS MEN MAY SEE
THERE SAW I DANE 53 TURN'D INTO A TREE

FOR VENGEANCE THAT HE SAW DIAN ALL NAKED

FOR WHICH SO SORE AGHAST WAS EMILY
THAT SHE WAS WELL NIGH MAD AND GAN TO CRY

TO DO TH' OFFICE OF FUNERAL SERVICE
HIGH LABOUR AND FULL GREAT APPARELING PREPARATION
WAS AT THE SERVICE AND THE PYRE MAKING
THAT WITH ITS GREENE TOP THE HEAVEN RAUGHT REACHED
AND TWENTY FATHOM BROAD ITS ARMES STRAUGHT STRETCHED
THIS IS TO SAY THE BOUGHES WERE SO BROAD
OF STRAW FIRST THERE WAS LAID MANY A LOAD
BUT HOW THE PYRE WAS MAKED UP ON HEIGHT

NOR HOW THE BEASTES AND THE BIRDES ALL
FLEDDEN FOR FEARE WHEN THE WOOD GAN FALL
NOR HOW THE GROUND AGHAST WAS OF THE LIGHT TERRIFIED
THAT WAS NOT WONT TO SEE THE SUNNE BRIGHT
NOR HOW THE FIRE WAS COUCHED FIRST WITH STRE LAID STRAW
AND THEN WITH DRY STICKES CLOVEN IN THREE
AND THEN WITH GREENE WOOD AND SPICERY SPICES
AND THEN WITH CLOTH OF GOLD AND WITH PIERRIE PRECIOUS STONES
AND GARLANDS HANGING WITH FULL MANY A FLOWER
THE MYRRH THE INCENSE WITH SO SWEET ODOUR
NOR HOW ARCITA LAY AMONG ALL THIS
NOR WHAT RICHESS ABOUT HIS BODY IS
NOR HOW THAT EMILY AS WAS THE GUISE CUSTOM

WHEN THAT THE FIRE WAS GREAT AND BURNED FAST
NOR HOW SOME CAST THEIR SHIELD AND SOME THEIR SPEAR
AND OF THEIR VESTIMENTS WHICH THAT THEY WEAR
AND CUPPES FULL OF WINE AND MILK AND BLOOD
INTO THE FIRE THAT BURNT AS IT WERE WOOD MAD
NOR HOW THE GREEKES WITH A HUGE ROUT PROCESSION

ALL THILKE NIGHT NOR HOW THE GREEKES PLAY THAT

WHO WRESTLED BEST NAKED WITH OIL ANOINT
NOR WHO THAT BARE HIM BEST IN NO DISJOINT
IN ANY CONTEST
I WILL NOT TELL EKE HOW THEY ALL ARE GONE
HOME TO ATHENES WHEN THE PLAY IS DONE
BUT SHORTLY TO THE POINT NOW WILL I WEND COME
AND MAKEN OF MY LONGE TALE AN END
BY PROCESS AND BY LENGTH OF CERTAIN YEARS
ALL STINTED IS THE MOURNING AND THE TEARS ENDED
OF GREEKES BY ONE GENERAL ASSENT
THEN SEEMED ME THERE WAS A PARLEMENT
AT ATHENS UPON CERTAIN POINTS AND CAS CASES
AMONGE THE WHICH POINTS Y SPOKEN WAS
TO HAVE WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES ALLIANCE
AND HAVE OF THEBANS FULL OBEISANCE
FOR WHICH THIS NOBLE THESEUS ANON
LET SEND AFTER THE GENTLE PALAMON CAUSED
UNWIST OF HIM WHAT WAS THE CAUSE AND WHY UNKNOWN
BUT IN HIS BLACKE CLOTHES SORROWFULLY
HE CAME AT HIS COMMANDMENT ON HIE IN HASTE
THEN SENTE THESEUS FOR EMILY
WHEN THEY WERE SET AND HUSH'D WAS ALL THE PLACE SEATED
AND THESEUS ABIDED HAD A SPACE WAITED
ERE ANY WORD CAME FROM HIS WISE BREAST
HIS EYEN SET HE THERE AS WAS HIS LEST HE CAST HIS EYES
AND WITH A SAD VISAGE HE SIGHED STILL WHEREVER HE PLEASED
AND AFTER THAT RIGHT THUS HE SAID HIS WILL
THE FIRSTE MOVER OF THE CAUSE ABOVE
WHEN HE FIRST MADE THE FAIRE CHAIN OF LOVE
GREAT WAS TH' EFFECT AND HIGH WAS HIS INTENT
WELL WIST HE WHY AND WHAT THEREOF HE MEANT
FOR WITH THAT FAIRE CHAIN OF LOVE HE BOND BOUND
THE FIRE THE AIR THE WATER AND THE LOND
IN CERTAIN BONDES THAT THEY MAY NOT FLEE 91
THAT SAME PRINCE AND MOVER EKE QUOTH HE
HATH STABLISH'D IN THIS WRETCHED WORLD ADOWN
CERTAIN OF DAYES AND DURATION
TO ALL THAT ARE ENGENDER'D IN THIS PLACE
OVER THE WHICHE DAY THEY MAY NOT PACE PASS
ALL MAY THEY YET THEIR DAYES WELL ABRIDGE
THERE NEEDETH NO AUTHORITY TO ALLEGE
FOR IT IS PROVED BY EXPERIENCE
BUT THAT ME LIST DECLARE MY SENTENCE
OPINION
THEN MAY MEN BY THIS ORDER WELL DISCERN
THAT THILKE MOVER STABLE IS AND ETERN
THE SAME
WELL MAY MEN KNOW BUT THAT IT BE A FOOL
THAT EVERY PART DERIVETH FROM ITS WHOLE
FOR NATURE HATH NOT TA'EN ITS BEGINNING
OF NO PARTIE NOR CANTLE OF A THING PART OR PIECE
BUT OF A THING THAT PERFECT IS AND STABLE
DESCENDING SO TILL IT BE CORRUPTABLE
AND THEREFORE OF HIS WISE PURVEYANCE PROVIDENCE
HE HATH SO WELL BESET HIS ORDINANCE
THAT SPECIES OF THINGS AND PROGRESSIONS
SHALLEN ENDURE BY SUCCESSIONS
AND NOT ETERN WITHOUTEN ANY LIE
THIS MAYST THOU UNDERSTAND AND SEE AT EYE
LO TH' OAK THAT HATH SO LONG A NOURISHING
FROM THE TIME THAT IT 'GINNETH FIRST TO SPRING
AND HATH SO LONG A LIFE AS YE MAY SEE
YET AT THE LAST Y WASTED IS THE TREE
CONSIDER EKE HOW THAT THE HARDE STONE
UNDER OUR FEET ON WHICH WE TREAD AND GON WALK
YET WASTETH AS IT LIETH BY THE WAY
THE BROADE RIVER SOME TIME WAXETH DREY
DRY
THE GREATE TOWNES SEE WE WANE AND WEND
GO DISAPPEAR
THEN MAY YE SEE THAT ALL THINGS HAVE AN END
OF MAN AND WOMAN SEE WE WELL ALSO
THAT NEEDES IN ONE OF THE TERMES TWO
THAT IS TO SAY IN YOUTH OR ELSE IN AGE
HE MUST BE DEAD THE KING AS SHALL A PAGE
SOME IN HIS BED SOME IN THE DEEPE SEA
SOME IN THE LARGE FIELD AS YE MAY SEE
THERE HELPETH NOUGHT ALL GO THAT ILKE WAY SAME
THEN MAY I SAY THAT ALLE THING MUST DIE
WHAT MAKETH THIS BUT JUPITER THE KING
THE WHICH IS PRINCE AND CAUSE OF ALLE THING
CONVERTING ALL UNTO HIS PROPER WILL
FROM WHICH IT IS DERIVED SOOTH TO TELL
AND HEREAGAINST NO CREATURE ALIVE
OF NO DEGREE AVAILETH FOR TO STRIVE
THEN IS IT WISDOM AS IT THINKETH ME
TO MAKE A VIRTUE OF NECESSITY
AND TAKE IT WELL THAT WE MAY NOT ESCHEW ESCAPE
AND NAMELY WHAT TO US ALL IS DUE
AND WHOSO GRUDGETH OUGHT HE DOTH FOLLY MURMURS AT
AND REBEL IS TO HIM THAT ALL MAY GIE
DIRECT GUIDE
AND CERTAINLY A MAN HATH MOST HONOUR
TO DIEN IN HIS EXCELLENCE AND FLOWER
WHEN HE IS SICKER OF HIS GOODE NAME
CERTAIN
THEN HATH HE DONE HIS FRIEND NOR HIM NO SHAME HIMSELF
AND GLADDER OUGHT HIS FRIEND BE OF HIS DEATH
WHEN WITH HONOUR IS YIELDED UP HIS BREATH
THAN WHEN HIS NAME APPALLED IS FOR AGE DECAYED BY OLD AGE
FOR ALL FORGOTTEN IS HIS VASSALAGE
VALOUR SERVICE
THEN IS IT BEST AS FOR A WORTHY FAME
TO DIEN WHEN A MAN IS BEST OF NAME
THE CONTRARY OF ALL THIS IS WILFULNESS
WHY GRUDGE WE WHY HAVE WE HEAVINESS
THAT GOOD ARCITE OF CHIVALRY THE FLOWER
DEPARTED IS WITH DUTY AND HONOUR
OUT OF THIS FOULE PRISON OF THIS LIFE
WHY GRUDGE HERE HIS COUSIN AND HIS WIFE
OF HIS WELFARE THAT LOVED HIM SO WELL
CAN HE THEM THANK NAY GOD WOT NEVERDEAL NOT A JOT
THAT BOTH HIS SOUL AND EKE THEMSELVES OFFEND HURT
AND YET THEY MAY THEIR LUSTES NOT AMEND
DESIRES CONTROL
WHAT MAY I CONCLUDE OF THIS LONGE SERIE STRING OF REMARKS
BUT AFTER SORROW I REDE US TO BE MERRY COUNSEL
AND THANKE JUPITER FOR ALL HIS GRACE
AND ERE THAT WE DEPARTE FROM THIS PLACE
I REDE THAT WE MAKE OF SORROWS TWO
ONE PERFECT JOYE LASTING EVERMO'
AND LOOK NOW WHERE MOST SORROW IS HEREIN
THERE WILL I FIRST AMENDEN AND BEGIN
SISTER QUOTH HE THIS IS MY FULL ASSENT

THUS ENDETH PALAMON AND EMILY
AND GOD SAVE ALL THIS FAIRE COMPANY
NOTES TO THE KNIGHT'S TALE
1
FOR THE PLAN AND PRINCIPAL INCIDENTS OF THE KNIGHT'S TALE
CHAUCER WAS INDEBTED TO BOCCACCIO WHO HAD HIMSELF BORROWED
FROM SOME PRIOR POET CHRONICLER OR ROMANCER
BOCCACCIO
SPEAKS OF THE STORY AS VERY ANCIENT AND THOUGH THAT MAY NOT
BE PROOF OF ITS ANTIQUITY IT CERTAINLY SHOWS THAT HE TOOK IT FROM
AN EARLIER WRITER
THE TALE IS MORE OR LESS A PARAPHRASE OF
BOCCACCIO'S THESEIDA BUT IN SOME POINTS THE COPY HAS A
DISTINCT DRAMATIC SUPERIORITY OVER THE ORIGINAL
THE THESEIDA
CONTAINED TEN THOUSAND LINES CHAUCER HAS CONDENSED IT INTO LESS
THAN ONE FOURTH OF THE NUMBER
THE KNIGHT'S TALE IS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE BEEN AT FIRST COMPOSED AS A SEPARATE WORK IT IS
UNDETERMINED WHETHER CHAUCER TOOK IT DIRECT FROM THE ITALIAN OF
BOCCACCIO OR FROM A FRENCH TRANSLATION

EITHER SUCCEED IN THE WAR AGAINST FRANCE OR DIE IN THE PAIN
OU IL MOURROIT EN LA PEINE IT WAS THE FASHION IN THOSE TIMES TO
SWEAR OATHS OF FRIENDSHIP AND BROTHERHOOD AND HENCE THOUGH
THE FASHION HAS LONG DIED OUT WE STILL SPEAK OF SWORN FRIENDS

IT WAS THE CUSTOM FOR SOLDIERS TO MARCH THRICE AROUND THE

SO PLACING ON HIS LEFT HAND THE EAST WHENCE GOOD OMENS CAME
WITH THE GREEKS HOWEVER THEIR AUGURS FACING THE NORTH IT WAS
JUST THE CONTRARY
THE CONFUSION FREQUENT IN CLASSICAL WRITERS IS

THE TALE 1
AT TROMPINGTON NOT FAR FROM CANTEBRIG CAMBRIDGE
THERE GOES A BROOK AND OVER THAT A BRIG
UPON THE WHICHE BROOK THERE STANDS A MILL
AND THIS IS VERY SOOTH THAT I YOU TELL
COMPLETE TRUTH
A MILLER WAS THERE DWELLING MANY A DAY
AS ANY PEACOCK HE WAS PROUD AND GAY
PIPEN HE COULD AND FISH AND NETTES BETE PREPARE
AND TURNE CUPS AND WRESTLE WELL AND SHETE
SHOOT
AYE BY HIS BELT HE BARE A LONG PAVADE PONIARD
AND OF HIS SWORD FULL TRENCHANT WAS THE BLADE
A JOLLY POPPER BARE HE IN HIS POUCH DAGGER
THERE WAS NO MAN FOR PERIL DURST HIM TOUCH
A SHEFFIELD WHITTLE BARE HE IN HIS HOSE
SMALL KNIFE
ROUND WAS HIS FACE AND CAMUSE WAS HIS NOSE
FLAT 2
AS PILLED AS AN APE'S WAS HIS SKULL
PEELED BALD
HE WAS A MARKET BETER AT THE FULL
BRAWLER
THERE DURSTE NO WIGHT HAND UPON HIM LEGGE LAY
THAT HE NE SWORE ANON HE SHOULD ABEGGE
SUFFER THE PENALTY
A THIEF HE WAS FOR SOOTH OF CORN AND MEAL
AND THAT A SLY AND USED WELL TO STEAL
HIS NAME WAS HOTEN DEINOUS SIMEKIN CALLED DISDAINFUL SIMKIN
A WIFE HE HADDE COME OF NOBLE KIN
THE PARSON OF THE TOWN HER FATHER WAS
WITH HER HE GAVE FULL MANY A PAN OF BRASS
FOR THAT SIMKIN SHOULD IN HIS BLOOD ALLY
SHE WAS Y FOSTER'D IN A NUNNERY
FOR SIMKIN WOULDE NO WIFE AS HE SAID
BUT SHE WERE WELL Y NOURISH'D AND A MAID
TO SAVEN HIS ESTATE AND YEOMANRY
AND SHE WAS PROUD AND PERT AS IS A PIE
MAGPIE
A FULL FAIR SIGHT IT WAS TO SEE THEM TWO
ON HOLY DAYS BEFORE HER WOULD HE GO
WITH HIS TIPPET Y BOUND ABOUT HIS HEAD HOOD
AND SHE CAME AFTER IN A GITE OF RED GOWN 3
AND SIMKIN HADDE HOSEN OF THE SAME
THERE DURSTE NO WIGHT CALL HER AUGHT BUT DAME
NONE WAS SO HARDY WALKING BY THAT WAY
THAT WITH HER EITHER DURSTE RAGE OR PLAY USE FREEDOM
BUT IF HE WOULD BE SLAIN BY SIMEKIN UNLESS
WITH PAVADE OR WITH KNIFE OR BODEKIN
FOR JEALOUS FOLK BE PER'LOUS EVERMO'
ALGATE THEY WOULD THEIR WIVES WENDE SO
UNLESS SO BEHAVE
AND EKE FOR SHE WAS SOMEWHAT SMUTTERLICH DIRTY
SHE WAS AS DIGN AS WATER IN A DITCH NASTY
AND ALL SO FULL OF HOKER AND BISMARE
ILL NATURE ABUSIVE SPEECH
HER THOUGHTE THAT A LADY SHOULD HER SPARE NOT JUDGE HER HARDLY
WHAT FOR HER KINDRED AND HER NORTELRIE NURTURING EDUCATION
THAT SHE HAD LEARNED IN THE NUNNERY
ONE DAUGHTER HADDE THEY BETWIXT THEM TWO
OF TWENTY YEAR WITHOUTEN ANY MO
SAVING A CHILD THAT WAS OF HALF YEAR AGE
IN CRADLE IT LAY AND WAS A PROPER PAGE BOY
THIS WENCHE THICK AND WELL Y GROWEN WAS
WITH CAMUSE NOSE AND EYEN GRAY AS GLASS FLAT
WITH BUTTOCKS BROAD AND BREASTES ROUND AND HIGH
BUT RIGHT FAIR WAS HER HAIR I WILL NOT LIE
THE PARSON OF THE TOWN FOR SHE WAS FAIR
IN PURPOSE WAS TO MAKE OF HER HIS HEIR
BOTH OF HIS CHATTELS AND HIS MESSUAGE
AND STRANGE HE MADE IT OF HER MARRIAGE
HE MADE IT A MATTER
HIS PURPOSE WAS FOR TO BESTOW HER HIGH OF DIFFICULTY
INTO SOME WORTHY BLOOD OF ANCESTRY
FOR HOLY CHURCH'S GOOD MAY BE DISPENDED SPENT
ON HOLY CHURCH'S BLOOD THAT IS DESCENDED
THEREFORE HE WOULD HIS HOLY BLOOD HONOUR
THOUGH THAT HE HOLY CHURCHE SHOULD DEVOUR
GREAT SOKEN HATH THIS MILLER OUT OF DOUBT TOLL TAKEN FOR GRINDING
WITH WHEAT AND MALT OF ALL THE LAND ABOUT
AND NAMELY THERE WAS A GREAT COLLEGE ESPECIALLY
MEN CALL THE SOLER HALL AT CANTEBREGE 4
THERE WAS THEIR WHEAT AND EKE THEIR MALT Y GROUND
AND ON A DAY IT HAPPED IN A STOUND SUDDENLY
SICK LAY THE MANCIPLE OF A MALADY STEWARD 5
MEN WEENED WISLY THAT HE SHOULDE DIE
THOUGHT CERTAINLY
FOR WHICH THIS MILLER STOLE BOTH MEAL AND CORN
AN HUNDRED TIMES MORE THAN BEFORN
FOR THERETOFORE HE STOLE BUT COURTEOUSLY
BUT NOW HE WAS A THIEF OUTRAGEOUSLY
FOR WHICH THE WARDEN CHID AND MADE FARE FUSS
BUT THEREOF SET THE MILLER NOT A TARE HE CARED NOT A RUSH
HE CRACK'D HIS BOAST AND SWORE IT WAS NOT SO
TALKED BIG
THEN WERE THERE YOUNGE POORE SCHOLARS TWO
THAT DWELLED IN THE HALL OF WHICH I SAY
TESTIF THEY WERE AND LUSTY FOR TO PLAY HEADSTRONG 6
AND ONLY FOR THEIR MIRTH AND REVELRY
UPON THE WARDEN BUSILY THEY CRY
TO GIVE THEM LEAVE FOR BUT A LITTLE STOUND SHORT TIME
TO GO TO MILL AND SEE THEIR CORN Y GROUND
AND HARDILY THEY DURSTE LAY THEIR NECK BOLDLY
THE MILLER SHOULD NOT STEAL THEM HALF A PECK
OF CORN BY SLEIGHT NOR THEM BY FORCE BEREAVE TAKE AWAY
AND AT THE LAST THE WARDEN GIVE THEM LEAVE
JOHN HIGHT THE ONE AND ALEIN HIGHT THE OTHER
OF ONE TOWN WERE THEY BORN THAT HIGHTE STROTHER 7

FOR ALL THE SLEIGHT IN THEIR PHILOSOPHY
THE MORE QUAINTE KNACKES THAT THEY MAKE ODD LITTLE TRICKS

THE TALE
A PRENTICE WHILOM DWELT IN OUR CITY
AND OF A CRAFT OF VICTUALLERS WAS HE
GALLIARD HE WAS AS GOLDFINCH IN THE SHAW LIVELY GROVE
BROWN AS A BERRY A PROPER SHORT FELLAW
WITH LOCKES BLACK COMBED FULL FETISLY DAINTILY
AND DANCE HE COULD SO WELL AND JOLLILY
THAT HE WAS CALLED PERKIN REVELLOUR
HE WAS AS FULL OF LOVE AND PARAMOUR
AS IS THE HONEYCOMB OF HONEY SWEET
WELL WAS THE WENCHE THAT WITH HIM MIGHT MEET
AT EVERY BRIDAL WOULD HE SING AND HOP
HE BETTER LOV'D THE TAVERN THAN THE SHOP
FOR WHEN THERE ANY RIDING WAS IN CHEAP 1
OUT OF THE SHOPPE THITHER WOULD HE LEAP
AND TILL THAT HE HAD ALL THE SIGHT Y SEEN
AND DANCED WELL HE WOULD NOT COME AGAIN
AND GATHER'D HIM A MEINIE OF HIS SORT COMPANY OF FELLOWS
TO HOP AND SING AND MAKE SUCH DISPORT
AND THERE THEY SETTE STEVEN FOR TO MEET MADE APPOINTMENT
TO PLAYEN AT THE DICE IN SUCH A STREET
FOR IN THE TOWNE WAS THERE NO PRENTICE
THAT FAIRER COULDE CAST A PAIR OF DICE
THAN PERKIN COULD AND THERETO HE WAS FREE HE SPENT MONEY LIBERALLY
OF HIS DISPENCE IN PLACE OF PRIVITY WHERE HE WOULD NOT BE SEEN
THAT FOUND HIS MASTER WELL IN HIS CHAFFARE MERCHANDISE
FOR OFTENTIME HE FOUND HIS BOX FULL BARE
FOR SOOTHELY A PRENTICE REVELLOUR
THAT HAUNTETH DICE RIOT AND PARAMOUR
HIS MASTER SHALL IT IN HIS SHOP ABIE SUFFER FOR
ALL HAVE HE NO PART OF THE MINSTRELSY
ALTHOUGH
FOR THEFT AND RIOT THEY BE CONVERTIBLE
ALL CAN THEY PLAY ON GITERN OR RIBIBLE GUITAR OR REBECK
REVEL AND TRUTH AS IN A LOW DEGREE

AND SOMETIMES LED WITH REVEL TO NEWGATE
BUT AT THE LAST HIS MASTER HIM BETHOUGHT
UPON A DAY WHEN HE HIS PAPER 2 SOUGHT
OF A PROVERB THAT SAITH THIS SAME WORD
BETTER IS ROTTEN APPLE OUT OF HOARD
THAN THAT IT SHOULD ROT ALL THE REMENANT
SO FARES IT BY A RIOTOUS SERVANT
IT IS WELL LESSE HARM TO LET HIM PACE PASS GO
THAN HE SHEND ALL THE SERVANTS IN THE PLACE
CORRUPT
THEREFORE HIS MASTER GAVE HIM A QUITTANCE
AND BADE HIM GO WITH SORROW AND MISCHANCE
AND THUS THIS JOLLY PRENTICE HAD HIS LEVE DESIRE
NOW LET HIM RIOT ALL THE NIGHT OR LEAVE
REFRAIN
AND FOR THERE IS NO THIEF WITHOUT A LOUKE 3
THAT HELPETH HIM TO WASTEN AND TO SOUK SPEND
OF THAT HE BRIBE CAN OR BORROW MAY STEAL
ANON HE SENT HIS BED AND HIS ARRAY
UNTO A COMPERE OF HIS OWEN SORT COMRADE

THE COOK'S TALE IS UNFINISHED IN ALL THE MANUSCRIPTS BUT IN
SOME OF MINOR AUTHORITY THE COOK IS MADE TO BREAK OFF HIS
TALE BECAUSE IT IS SO FOUL AND TO TELL THE STORY OF GAMELYN ON
WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S AS YOU LIKE IT IS FOUNDED
THE STORY IS
NOT CHAUCER'S AND IS DIFFERENT IN METRE AND INFERIOR IN
COMPOSITION TO THE TALES
IT IS SUPPOSED THAT CHAUCER EXPUNGED
THE COOK'S TALE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT MADE HIM ON HIS DEATH
BED LAMENT THAT HE HAD WRITTEN SO MUCH RIBALDRY
THE MAN OF LAW'S TALE
THE PROLOGUE
OUR HOSTE SAW WELL THAT THE BRIGHTE SUN
TH' ARC OF HIS ARTIFICIAL DAY HAD RUN
THE FOURTHE PART AND HALF AN HOURE MORE
AND THOUGH HE WERE NOT DEEP EXPERT IN LORE
HE WIST IT WAS THE EIGHT AND TWENTY DAY
OF APRIL THAT IS MESSENGER TO MAY
AND SAW WELL THAT THE SHADOW OF EVERY TREE
WAS IN ITS LENGTH OF THE SAME QUANTITY
THAT WAS THE BODY ERECT THAT CAUSED IT
AND THEREFORE BY THE SHADOW HE TOOK HIS WIT KNOWLEDGE
THAT PHOEBUS WHICH THAT SHONE SO CLEAR AND BRIGHT
DEGREES WAS FIVE AND FORTY CLOMB ON HEIGHT

IN YOUTH HE MADE OF CEYX AND ALCYON 4
AND SINCE THEN HE HATH SPOKE OF EVERY ONE

HOW THAT THE CURSED KING ANTIOCHUS
BEREFT HIS DAUGHTER OF HER MAIDENHEAD
THAT IS SO HORRIBLE A TALE TO READ
WHEN HE HER THREW UPON THE PAVEMENT

WOULD NEVER WRITE IN NONE OF HIS SERMONS
OF SUCH UNKIND ABOMINATIONS UNNATURAL

IN SYRIA WHILOM DWELT A COMPANY
OF CHAPMEN RICH AND THERETO SAD AND TRUE GRAVE STEADFAST
CLOTHES OF GOLD AND SATINS RICH OF HUE
THAT WIDEWHERE SENT THEIR SPICERY TO DISTANT PARTS
THEIR CHAFFARE WAS SO THRIFTLY AND SO NEW WARES ADVANTAGEOUS
THAT EVERY WIGHT HAD DAINTY TO CHAFFARE PLEASURE DEAL
WITH THEM AND EKE TO SELLE THEM THEIR WARE
NOW FELL IT THAT THE MASTERS OF THAT SORT
HAVE SHAPEN THEM TO ROME FOR TO WEND DETERMINED PREPARED
WERE IT FOR CHAPMANHOOD OR FOR DISPORT TRADING
NONE OTHER MESSAGE WOULD THEY THITHER SEND
BUT COME THEMSELVES TO ROME THIS IS THE END
AND IN SUCH PLACE AS THOUGHT THEM A VANTAGE
FOR THEIR INTENT THEY TOOK THEIR HERBERGAGE LODGING
SOJOURNED HAVE THESE MERCHANTS IN THAT TOWN

THE STRIFE OF THEBES AND OF HERCULES
OF SAMSON TURNUS AND OF SOCRATES
THE DEATH BUT MENNES WITTES BE SO DULL
THAT NO WIGHT CAN WELL READ IT AT THE FULL
THIS SOUDAN FOR HIS PRIVY COUNCIL SENT
AND SHORTLY OF THIS MATTER FOR TO PACE TO PASS BRIEFLY BY
HE HATH TO THEM DECLARED HIS INTENT
AND TOLD THEM CERTAIN BUT HE MIGHT HAVE GRACE UNLESS
TO HAVE CONSTANCE WITHIN A LITTLE SPACE
HE WAS BUT DEAD AND CHARGED THEM IN HIE HASTE
TO SHAPE FOR HIS LIFE SOME REMEDY
CONTRIVE
DIVERSE MEN DIVERSE THINGES SAID
AND ARGUMENTS THEY CASTEN UP AND DOWN
MANY A SUBTLE REASON FORTH THEY LAID
THEY SPEAK OF MAGIC AND ABUSION DECEPTION
BUT FINALLY AS IN CONCLUSION
THEY CANNOT SEE IN THAT NONE AVANTAGE
NOR IN NO OTHER WAY SAVE MARRIAGE
THEN SAW THEY THEREIN SUCH DIFFICULTY
BY WAY OF REASON FOR TO SPEAK ALL PLAIN
BECAUSE THAT THERE WAS SUCH DIVERSITY
BETWEEN THEIR BOTHE LAWES THAT THEY SAYN
THEY TROWE THAT NO CHRISTIAN PRINCE WOULD FAIN BELIEVE WILLINGLY
WEDDEN HIS CHILD UNDER OUR LAWE SWEET
THAT US WAS GIVEN BY MAHOUND OUR PROPHETE
MAHOMET
AND HE ANSWERED RATHER THAN I LOSE
CONSTANCE I WILL BE CHRISTEN'D DOUBTELESS
I MUST BE HERS I MAY NONE OTHER CHOOSE
I PRAY YOU HOLD YOUR ARGUMENTS IN PEACE 4
SAVE MY LIFE AND BE NOT RECKELESS
TO GETTE HER THAT HATH MY LIFE IN CURE KEEPING
FOR IN THIS WOE I MAY NOT LONG ENDURE
WHAT NEEDETH GREATER DILATATION
I SAY BY TREATY AND AMBASSADRY
AND BY THE POPE'S MEDIATION
AND ALL THE CHURCH AND ALL THE CHIVALRY
THAT IN DESTRUCTION OF MAH'METRY MAHOMETANISM
AND IN INCREASE OF CHRISTE'S LAWE DEAR
THEY BE ACCORDED SO AS YE MAY HEAR AGREED
HOW THAT THE SOUDAN AND HIS BARONAGE
AND ALL HIS LIEGES SHALL Y CHRISTEN'D BE
AND HE SHALL HAVE CONSTANCE IN MARRIAGE
AND CERTAIN GOLD I N'OT WHAT QUANTITY KNOW NOT
AND HERETO FIND THEY SUFFISANT SURETY
THE SAME ACCORD IS SWORN ON EITHER SIDE
NOW FAIR CONSTANCE ALMIGHTY GOD THEE GUIDE
NOW WOULDE SOME MEN WAITEN AS I GUESS
THAT I SHOULD TELLEN ALL THE PURVEYANCE PROVISION
THE WHICH THE EMPEROR OF HIS NOBLESSE
HATH SHAPEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER DAME CONSTANCE
PREPARED
WELL MAY MEN KNOW THAT SO GREAT ORDINANCE
MAY NO MAN TELLEN IN A LITTLE CLAUSE
AS WAS ARRAYED FOR SO HIGH A CAUSE
BISHOPS BE SHAPEN WITH HER FOR TO WEND
LORDES LADIES AND KNIGHTES OF RENOWN
AND OTHER FOLK ENOUGH THIS IS THE END
AND NOTIFIED IS THROUGHOUT ALL THE TOWN
THAT EVERY WIGHT WITH GREAT DEVOTIOUN
SHOULD PRAY TO CHRIST THAT HE THIS MARRIAGE
RECEIVE IN GREE AND SPEEDE THIS VOYAGE
WITH GOOD WILL FAVOUR
THE DAY IS COMEN OF HER DEPARTING
I SAY THE WOFUL FATAL DAY IS COME
THAT THERE MAY BE NO LONGER TARRYING
BUT FORWARD THEY THEM DRESSEN ALL AND SOME
PREPARE TO SET OUT
CONSTANCE THAT WAS WITH SORROW ALL O'ERCOME
FULL PALE AROSE AND DRESSED HER TO WEND
FOR WELL SHE SAW THERE WAS NO OTHER END
ALAS WHAT WONDER IS IT THOUGH SHE WEPT
THAT SHALL BE SENT TO A STRANGE NATION
FROM FRIENDES THAT SO TENDERLY HER KEPT
AND TO BE BOUND UNDER SUBJECTION
OF ONE SHE KNEW NOT HIS CONDITION
HUSBANDS BE ALL GOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF YORE OF OLD
THAT KNOWE WIVES I DARE SAY NO MORE
FATHER SHE SAID THY WRETCHED CHILD CONSTANCE
THY YOUNGE DAUGHTER FOSTER'D UP SO SOFT
AND YOU MY MOTHER MY SOV'REIGN PLEASANCE
OVER ALL THING OUT TAKEN CHRIST ON LOFT EXCEPT ON HIGH
CONSTANCE YOUR CHILD HER RECOMMENDETH OFT
UNTO YOUR GRACE FOR I SHALL TO SYRIE
NOR SHALL I EVER SEE YOU MORE WITH EYE
ALAS UNTO THE BARBAROUS NATION
I MUST ANON SINCE THAT IT IS YOUR WILL
BUT CHRIST THAT STARF FOR OUR REDEMPTION DIED
SO GIVE ME GRACE HIS HESTES TO FULFIL
COMMANDS
I WRETCHED WOMAN NO FORCE THOUGH I SPILL NO MATTER THOUGH
WOMEN ARE BORN TO THRALDOM AND PENANCE I PERISH
AND TO BE UNDER MANNES GOVERNANCE
I TROW AT TROY WHEN PYRRHUS BRAKE THE WALL
OR ILION BURNT OR THEBES THE CITY
NOR AT ROME FOR THE HARM THROUGH HANNIBAL
THAT ROMANS HATH Y VANQUISH'D TIMES THREE
WAS HEARD SUCH TENDER WEEPING FOR PITY
AS IN THE CHAMBER WAS FOR HER PARTING
BUT FORTH SHE MUST WHETHER SHE WEEP OR SING
O FIRSTE MOVING CRUEL FIRMAMENT 5
WITH THY DIURNAL SWAY THAT CROWDEST AYE PUSHEST TOGETHER DRIVEST
AND HURTLEST ALL FROM EAST TILL OCCIDENT
THAT NATURALLY WOULD HOLD ANOTHER WAY
THY CROWDING SET THE HEAV'N IN SUCH ARRAY
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FIERCE VOYAGE
THAT CRUEL MARS HATH SLAIN THIS MARRIAGE
UNFORTUNATE ASCENDANT TORTUOUS
OF WHICH THE LORD IS HELPLESS FALL'N ALAS
OUT OF HIS ANGLE INTO THE DARKEST HOUSE
O MARS O ATYZAR 6 AS IN THIS CASE
O FEEBLE MOON UNHAPPY IS THY PACE PROGRESS
THOU KNITTEST THEE WHERE THOU ART NOT RECEIV'D
WHERE THOU WERT WELL FROM THENNES ART THOU WEIV'D
7
IMPRUDENT EMPEROR OF ROME ALAS
WAS THERE NO PHILOSOPHER IN ALL THY TOWN
IS NO TIME BET THAN OTHER IN SUCH CASE BETTER
OF VOYAGE IS THERE NONE ELECTION
NAMELY TO FOLK OF HIGH CONDITION ESPECIALLY
NOT WHEN A ROOT IS OF A BIRTH Y KNOW WHEN THE NATIVITY IS KNOWN
ALAS WE BE TOO LEWED OR TOO SLOW
IGNORANT
TO SHIP WAS BROUGHT THIS WOEFUL FAIRE MAID
SOLEMNELY WITH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE
NOW JESUS CHRIST BE WITH YOU ALL SHE SAID
THERE IS NO MORE BUT FAREWELL FAIR CONSTANCE
SHE PAINED HER TO MAKE GOOD COUNTENANCE
MADE AN EFFORT
AND FORTH I LET HER SAIL IN THIS MANNER
AND TURN I WILL AGAIN TO MY MATTER
THE MOTHER OF THE SOUDAN WELL OF VICES
ESPIED HATH HER SONE'S PLAIN INTENT
HOW HE WILL LEAVE HIS OLDE SACRIFICES
AND RIGHT ANON SHE FOR HER COUNCIL SENT
AND THEY BE COME TO KNOWE WHAT SHE MEANT
AND WHEN ASSEMBLED WAS THIS FOLK IN FERE TOGETHER
SHE SAT HER DOWN AND SAID AS YE SHALL HEAR
LORDES SHE SAID YE KNOWEN EVERY ONE
HOW THAT MY SON IN POINT IS FOR TO LETE FORSAKE
THE HOLY LAWES OF OUR ALKARON KORAN
GIVEN BY GOD'S MESSENGER MAHOMETE
BUT ONE AVOW TO GREATE GOD I HETE PROMISE
LIFE SHALL RATHER OUT OF MY BODY START
THAN MAHOMET'S LAW GO OUT OF MINE HEART
WHAT SHOULD US TIDEN OF THIS NEWE LAW BETIDE BEFALL
BUT THRALDOM TO OUR BODIES AND PENANCE
AND AFTERWARD IN HELL TO BE Y DRAW
FOR WE RENIED MAHOUND OUR CREANCE DENIED MAHOMET OUR BELIEF
BUT LORDES WILL YE MAKEN ASSURANCE
AS I SHALL SAY ASSENTING TO MY LORE ADVICE
AND I SHALL MAKE US SAFE FOR EVERMORE
THEY SWOREN AND ASSENTED EVERY MAN
TO LIVE WITH HER AND DIE AND BY HER STAND
AND EVERY ONE IN THE BEST WISE HE CAN
TO STRENGTHEN HER SHALL ALL HIS FRIENDES FAND ENDEAVOUR 8
AND SHE HATH THIS EMPRISE TAKEN IN HAND
WHICH YE SHALL HEARE THAT I SHALL DEVISE RELATE
AND TO THEM ALL SHE SPAKE RIGHT IN THIS WISE
WE SHALL FIRST FEIGN US CHRISTENDOM TO TAKE EMBRACE CHRISTIANITY
COLD WATER SHALL NOT GRIEVE US BUT A LITE LITTLE
AND I SHALL SUCH A FEAST AND REVEL MAKE
THAT AS I TROW I SHALL THE SOUDAN QUITE REQUITE MATCH
FOR THOUGH HIS WIFE BE CHRISTEN'D NE'ER SO WHITE
SHE SHALL HAVE NEED TO WASH AWAY THE RED
THOUGH SHE A FOUNT OF WATER WITH HER LED
O SOUDANESS ROOT OF INIQUITY SULTANESS
VIRAGO THOU SEMIRAMIS THE SECOND
O SERPENT UNDER FEMININITY
LIKE TO THE SERPENT DEEP IN HELL Y BOUND
O FEIGNED WOMAN ALL THAT MAY CONFOUND
VIRTUE AND INNOCENCE THROUGH THY MALICE
IS BRED IN THEE AS NEST OF EVERY VICE
O SATAN ENVIOUS SINCE THILKE DAY
THAT THOU WERT CHASED FROM OUR HERITAGE
WELL KNOWEST THOU TO WOMAN TH' OLDE WAY
THOU MADEST EVE TO BRING US IN SERVAGE BONDAGE
THOU WILT FORDO THIS CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE RUIN
THINE INSTRUMENT SO WELL AWAY THE WHILE
MAK'ST THOU OF WOMEN WHEN THOU WILT BEGUILE
THIS SOUDANESS WHOM I THUS BLAME AND WARRAY OPPOSE CENSURE
LET PRIVILY HER COUNCIL GO THEIR WAY
WHY SHOULD I IN THIS TALE LONGER TARRY
SHE RODE UNTO THE SOUDAN ON A DAY
AND SAID HIM THAT SHE WOULD RENY HER LAY RENOUNCE HER CREED
AND CHRISTENDOM OF PRIESTES' HANDES FONG TAKE 9
REPENTING HER SHE HEATHEN WAS SO LONG
BESEECHING HIM TO DO HER THAT HONOUR
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE THE CHRISTIAN FOLK TO FEAST
TO PLEASE THEM I WILL DO MY LABOUR
THE SOUDAN SAID I WILL DO AT YOUR HEST DESIRE
AND KNEELING THANKED HER FOR THAT REQUEST
SO GLAD HE WAS HE WIST NOT WHAT TO SAY
KNEW
SHE KISS'D HER SON AND HOME SHE WENT HER WAY
ARRIVED BE THESE CHRISTIAN FOLK TO LAND
IN SYRIA WITH A GREAT SOLEMNE ROUT
AND HASTILY THIS SOUDAN SENT HIS SOND MESSAGE
FIRST TO HIS MOTHER AND ALL THE REALM ABOUT
AND SAID HIS WIFE WAS COMEN OUT OF DOUBT
AND PRAY'D THEM FOR TO RIDE AGAIN THE QUEEN TO MEET
THE HONOUR OF HIS REGNE TO SUSTENE
REALM
GREAT WAS THE PRESS AND RICH WAS THE ARRAY
OF SYRIANS AND ROMANS MET IN FERE
IN COMPANY
THE MOTHER OF THE SOUDAN RICH AND GAY
RECEIVED HER WITH ALL SO GLAD A CHEER FACE
AS ANY MOTHER MIGHT HER DAUGHTER DEAR
AND TO THE NEXTE CITY THERE BESIDE
A SOFTE PACE SOLEMNELY THEY RIDE
NOUGHT TROW I THE TRIUMPH OF JULIUS
OF WHICH THAT LUCAN MAKETH SUCH A BOAST
WAS ROYALLER OR MORE CURIOUS
THAN WAS TH' ASSEMBLY OF THIS BLISSFUL HOST
BUT O THIS SCORPION THIS WICKED GHOST SPIRIT
THE SOUDANESS FOR ALL HER FLATTERING
CAST UNDER THIS FULL MORTALLY TO STING
CONTRIVED
THE SOUDAN CAME HIMSELF SOON AFTER THIS
SO ROYALLY THAT WONDER IS TO TELL
AND WELCOMED HER WITH ALL JOY AND BLISS
AND THUS IN MIRTH AND JOY I LET THEM DWELL
THE FRUIT OF HIS MATTER IS THAT I TELL
WHEN THE TIME CAME MEN THOUGHT IT FOR THE BEST
THAT REVEL STINT AND MEN GO TO THEIR REST
CEASE
THE TIME IS COME THAT THIS OLD SOUDANESS
ORDAINED HATH THE FEAST OF WHICH I TOLD
AND TO THE FEAST THE CHRISTIAN FOLK THEM DRESS
IN GENERAL YEA BOTHE YOUNG AND OLD
THERE MAY MEN FEAST AND ROYALTY BEHOLD
AND DAINTIES MORE THAN I CAN YOU DEVISE
BUT ALL TOO DEAR THEY BOUGHT IT ERE THEY RISE
O SUDDEN WOE THAT EV'R ART SUCCESSOUR
TO WORLDLY BLISS SPRENT IS WITH BITTERNESS SPRINKLED
TH' END OF OUR JOY OF OUR WORLDLY LABOUR
WOE OCCUPIES THE FINE OF OUR GLADNESS
SEIZES THE END
HEARKEN THIS COUNSEL FOR THY SICKERNESS SECURITY
UPON THY GLADE DAYS HAVE IN THY MIND
THE UNWARE WOE OF HARM THAT COMES BEHIND
UNFORESEEN
FOR SHORTLY FOR TO TELL IT AT A WORD
THE SOUDAN AND THE CHRISTIANS EVERY ONE
WERE ALL TO HEWN AND STICKED AT THE BOARD CUT TO PIECES
BUT IT WERE ONLY DAME CONSTANCE ALONE
THIS OLDE SOUDANESS THIS CURSED CRONE
HAD WITH HER FRIENDES DONE THIS CURSED DEED
FOR SHE HERSELF WOULD ALL THE COUNTRY LEAD
NOR THERE WAS SYRIAN THAT WAS CONVERTED
THAT OF THE COUNSEL OF THE SOUDAN WOT KNEW
THAT WAS NOT ALL TO HEWN ERE HE ASTERTED ESCAPED
AND CONSTANCE HAVE THEY TA'EN ANON FOOT HOT IMMEDIATELY
AND IN A SHIP ALL STEERELESS GOD WOT WITHOUT RUDDER
THEY HAVE HER SET AND BID HER LEARN TO SAIL
OUT OF SYRIA AGAIN WARD TO ITALE BACK TO ITALY
A CERTAIN TREASURE THAT SHE THITHER LAD TOOK
AND SOOTH TO SAY OF VICTUAL GREAT PLENTY
THEY HAVE HER GIV'N AND CLOTHES EKE SHE HAD
AND FORTH SHE SAILED IN THE SALTE SEA
O MY CONSTANCE FULL OF BENIGNITY
O EMPERORES YOUNGE DAUGHTER DEAR
HE THAT IS LORD OF FORTUNE BE THY STEER RUDDER GUIDE
SHE BLESS'D HERSELF AND WITH FULL PITEOUS VOICE
UNTO THE CROSS OF CHRIST THUS SAIDE SHE
O DEAR O WEALFUL ALTAR HOLY CROSS BLESSED BENEFICENT
RED OF THE LAMBES BLOOD FULL OF PITY
THAT WASH'D THE WORLD FROM OLD INIQUITY
ME FROM THE FIEND AND FROM HIS CLAWES KEEP
THAT DAY THAT I SHALL DRENCHEN IN THE DEEPE
DROWN
VICTORIOUS TREE PROTECTION OF THE TRUE
THAT ONLY WORTHY WERE FOR TO BEAR
THE KING OF HEAVEN WITH HIS WOUNDES NEW
THE WHITE LAMB THAT HURT WAS WITH A SPEAR
FLEMER OF FIENDES OUT OF HIM AND HER BANISHER DRIVER OUT
ON WHICH THY LIMBES FAITHFULLY EXTEND 10
ME KEEP AND GIVE ME MIGHT MY LIFE TO MEND
YEARES AND DAYS FLOATED THIS CREATURE
THROUGHOUT THE SEA OF GREECE UNTO THE STRAIT
OF MAROC AS IT WAS HER A VENTURE MOROCCO GIBRALTAR
ON MANY A SORRY MEAL NOW MAY SHE BAIT
AFTER HER DEATH FULL OFTEN MAY SHE WAIT EXPECT
ERE THAT THE WILDE WAVES WILL HER DRIVE
UNTO THE PLACE THERE AS SHE SHALL ARRIVE
WHERE
MEN MIGHTEN ASKE WHY SHE WAS NOT SLAIN
EKE AT THE FEAST WHO MIGHT HER BODY SAVE
AND I ANSWER TO THAT DEMAND AGAIN
WHO SAVED DANIEL IN THE HORRIBLE CAVE
WHERE EVERY WIGHT SAVE HE MASTER OR KNAVE SERVANT
WAS WITH THE LION FRETT ERE HE ASTART DEVOURED ESCAPED
NO WIGHT BUT GOD THAT HE BARE IN HIS HEART
GOD LIST TO SHEW HIS WONDERFUL MIRACLE IT PLEASED
IN HER THAT WE SHOULD SEE HIS MIGHTY WORKES
CHRIST WHICH THAT IS TO EVERY HARM TRIACLE REMEDY SALVE
BY CERTAIN MEANES OFT AS KNOWE CLERKES SCHOLARS
DOTH THING FOR CERTAIN ENDE THAT FULL DERK IS
TO MANNE'S WIT THAT FOR OUR IGNORANCE
NE CANNOT KNOW HIS PRUDENT PURVEYANCE
FORESIGHT
NOW SINCE SHE WAS NOT AT THE FEAST Y SLAW SLAIN
WHO KEPTE HER FROM DROWNING IN THE SEA
WHO KEPTE JONAS IN THE FISH'S MAW
TILL HE WAS SPOUTED UP AT NINEVEH
WELL MAY MEN KNOW IT WAS NO WIGHT BUT HE
THAT KEPT THE HEBREW PEOPLE FROM DROWNING
WITH DRYE FEET THROUGHOUT THE SEA PASSING
WHO BADE THE FOURE SPIRITS OF TEMPEST 11
THAT POWER HAVE T' ANNOYE LAND AND SEA
BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AND ALSO WEST AND EAST
ANNOYE NEITHER SEA NOR LAND NOR TREE
SOOTHLY THE COMMANDER OF THAT WAS HE
THAT FROM THE TEMPEST AYE THIS WOMAN KEPT
AS WELL WHEN SHE AWOKE AS WHEN SHE SLEPT
WHERE MIGHT THIS WOMAN MEAT AND DRINKE HAVE
THREE YEAR AND MORE HOW LASTED HER VITAILLE VICTUALS
WHO FED THE EGYPTIAN MARY IN THE CAVE
OR IN DESERT NO WIGHT BUT CHRIST SANS FAILLE WITHOUT FAIL
FIVE THOUSAND FOLK IT WAS AS GREAT MARVAILLE
WITH LOAVES FIVE AND FISHES TWO TO FEED
GOD SENT HIS FOISON AT HER GREATE NEED
ABUNDANCE
SHE DRIVED FORTH INTO OUR OCEAN
THROUGHOUT OUR WILDE SEA TILL AT THE LAST
UNDER AN HOLD THAT NEMPNEN I NOT CAN CASTLE NAME
FAR IN NORTHUMBERLAND THE WAVE HER CAST
AND IN THE SAND HER SHIP STICKED SO FAST
THAT THENNES WOULD IT NOT IN ALL A TIDE 12
THE WILL OF CHRIST WAS THAT SHE SHOULD ABIDE
THE CONSTABLE OF THE CASTLE DOWN DID FARE GO
TO SEE THIS WRECK AND ALL THE SHIP HE SOUGHT SEARCHED
AND FOUND THIS WEARY WOMAN FULL OF CARE
HE FOUND ALSO THE TREASURE THAT SHE BROUGHT
IN HER LANGUAGE MERCY SHE BESOUGHT
THE LIFE OUT OF HER BODY FOR TO TWIN DIVIDE
HER TO DELIVER OF WOE THAT SHE WAS IN
A MANNER LATIN CORRUPT 13 WAS HER SPEECH
BUT ALGATE THEREBY WAS SHE UNDERSTOND
NEVERTHELESS
THE CONSTABLE WHEN HIM LIST NO LONGER SEECH SEARCH
THIS WOEFUL WOMAN BROUGHT HE TO THE LOND
SHE KNEELED DOWN AND THANKED GODDE'S SOND WHAT GOD HAD SENT
BUT WHAT SHE WAS SHE WOULD TO NO MAN SAY
FOR FOUL NOR FAIR ALTHOUGH THAT SHE SHOULD DEY DIE
SHE SAID SHE WAS SO MAZED IN THE SEA
THAT SHE FORGOT HER MINDE BY HER TRUTH
THE CONSTABLE HAD OF HER SO GREAT PITY
AND EKE HIS WIFE THAT THEY WEPT FOR RUTH PITY
SHE WAS SO DILIGENT WITHOUTE SLOUTH
TO SERVE AND PLEASE EVERY ONE IN THAT PLACE
THAT ALL HER LOV'D THAT LOOKED IN HER FACE
THE CONSTABLE AND DAME HERMEGILD HIS WIFE
WERE PAGANS AND THAT COUNTRY EVERY WHERE
BUT HERMEGILD LOV'D CONSTANCE AS HER LIFE
AND CONSTANCE HAD SO LONG SOJOURNED THERE
IN ORISONS WITH MANY A BITTER TEAR
TILL JESUS HAD CONVERTED THROUGH HIS GRACE
DAME HERMEGILD CONSTABLESS OF THAT PLACE
IN ALL THAT LAND NO CHRISTIANS DURSTE ROUT ASSEMBLE
ALL CHRISTIAN FOLK HAD FLED FROM THAT COUNTRY
THROUGH PAGANS THAT CONQUERED ALL ABOUT
THE PLAGES OF THE NORTH BY LAND AND SEA
REGIONS COASTS
TO WALES HAD FLED THE CHRISTIANITY THE OLD BRITONS WHO
OF OLDE BRITONS DWELLING IN THIS ISLE WERE CHRISTIANS
THERE WAS THEIR REFUGE FOR THE MEANEWHILE
BUT YET N'ERE CHRISTIAN BRITONS SO EXILED THERE WERE
THAT THERE N'ERE SOME WHICH IN THEIR PRIVITY NOT
HONOURED CHRIST AND HEATHEN FOLK BEGUILED
AND NIGH THE CASTLE SUCH THERE DWELLED THREE
AND ONE OF THEM WAS BLIND AND MIGHT NOT SEE
BUT IT WERE WITH THILK EYEN OF HIS MIND EXCEPT THOSE
WITH WHICH MEN MAYE SEE WHEN THEY BE BLIND
BRIGHT WAS THE SUN AS IN A SUMMER'S DAY
FOR WHICH THE CONSTABLE AND HIS WIFE ALSO
AND CONSTANCE HAVE Y TAKE THE RIGHTE WAY
TOWARD THE SEA A FURLONG WAY OR TWO
TO PLAYEN AND TO ROAME TO AND FRO
AND IN THEIR WALK THIS BLINDE MAN THEY MET
CROOKED AND OLD WITH EYEN FAST Y SHET SHUT
IN THE NAME OF CHRIST CRIED THIS BLIND BRITON
DAME HERMEGILD GIVE ME MY SIGHT AGAIN
THIS LADY WAX'D AFRAYED OF THAT SOUN' WAS ALARMED BY THAT CRY
LEST THAT HER HUSBAND SHORTLY FOR TO SAYN
WOULD HER FOR JESUS CHRISTE'S LOVE HAVE SLAIN
TILL CONSTANCE MADE HER HOLD AND BADE HER WIRCH WORK
THE WILL OF CHRIST AS DAUGHTER OF HOLY CHURCH
THE CONSTABLE WAX'D ABASHED OF THAT SIGHT ASTONISHED
AND SAIDE WHAT AMOUNTETH ALL THIS FARE WHAT MEANS ALL
CONSTANCE ANSWERED SIR IT IS CHRIST'S MIGHT THIS ADO
THAT HELPETH FOLK OUT OF THE FIENDES SNARE
AND SO FARFORTH SHE GAN OUR LAW DECLARE WITH SUCH EFFECT
THAT SHE THE CONSTABLE ERE THAT IT WERE EVE
CONVERTED AND ON CHRIST MADE HIM BELIEVE
THIS CONSTABLE WAS NOT LORD OF THE PLACE
OF WHICH I SPEAK THERE AS HE CONSTANCE FAND FOUND
BUT KEPT IT STRONGLY MANY A WINTER SPACE
UNDER ALLA KING OF NORTHUMBERLAND
THAT WAS FULL WISE AND WORTHY OF HIS HAND
AGAINST THE SCOTES AS MEN MAY WELL HEAR
BUT TURN I WILL AGAIN TO MY MATTERE
SATAN THAT EVER US WAITETH TO BEGUILE
SAW OF CONSTANCE ALL HER PERFECTIOUN
AND CAST ANON HOW HE MIGHT QUITE HER WHILE CONSIDERED HOW TO HAVE
AND MADE A YOUNG KNIGHT THAT DWELT IN THAT TOWN REVENGE ON HER
LOVE HER SO HOT OF FOUL AFFECTIOUN
THAT VERILY HIM THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD SPILL PERISH
BUT HE OF HER MIGHT ONES HAVE HIS WILL
UNLESS
HE WOOED HER BUT IT AVAILED NOUGHT
SHE WOULDE DO NO SINNE BY NO WAY
AND FOR DESPITE HE COMPASSED HIS THOUGHT
TO MAKE HER A SHAMEFUL DEATH TO DEY DIE
HE WAITETH WHEN THE CONSTABLE IS AWAY
AND PRIVILY UPON A NIGHT HE CREPT
IN HERMEGILDA'S CHAMBER WHILE SHE SLEPT
WEARY FORWAKED IN HER ORISONS HAVING BEEN LONG AWAKE
SLEEPETH CONSTANCE AND HERMEGILD ALSO
THIS KNIGHT THROUGH SATANAS' TEMPTATION
ALL SOFTETLY IS TO THE BED Y GO GONE
AND CUT THE THROAT OF HERMEGILD IN TWO
AND LAID THE BLOODY KNIFE BY DAME CONSTANCE
AND WENT HIS WAY THERE GOD GIVE HIM MISCHANCE
SOON AFTER CAME THE CONSTABLE HOME AGAIN
AND EKE ALLA THAT KING WAS OF THAT LAND
AND SAW HIS WIFE DISPITEOUSLY SLAIN CRUELLY
FOR WHICH FULL OFT HE WEPT AND WRUNG HIS HAND
AND ILL THE BED THE BLOODY KNIFE HE FAND
BY DAME CONSTANCE ALAS WHAT MIGHT SHE SAY
FOR VERY WOE HER WIT WAS ALL AWAY
TO KING ALLA WAS TOLD ALL THIS MISCHANCE
AND EKE THE TIME AND WHERE AND IN WHAT WISE
THAT IN A SHIP WAS FOUNDEN THIS CONSTANCE
AS HERE BEFORE YE HAVE ME HEARD DEVISE DESCRIBE
THE KINGES HEART FOR PITY GAN AGRISE TO BE GRIEVED TO TREMBLE
WHEN HE SAW SO BENIGN A CREATURE
FALL IN DISEASE AND IN MISAVENTURE
DISTRESS
FOR AS THE LAMB TOWARD HIS DEATH IS BROUGHT
SO STOOD THIS INNOCENT BEFORE THE KING
THIS FALSE KNIGHT THAT HAD THIS TREASON WROUGHT
BORE HER IN HAND THAT SHE HAD DONE THIS THING ACCUSED HER FALSELY
BUT NATHELESS THERE WAS GREAT MURMURING
AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT SAY THEY CANNOT GUESS
THAT SHE HAD DONE SO GREAT A WICKEDNESS
FOR THEY HAD SEEN HER EVER VIRTUOUS
AND LOVING HERMEGILD RIGHT AS HER LIFE
OF THIS BARE WITNESS EACH ONE IN THAT HOUSE
SAVE HE THAT HERMEGILD SLEW WITH HIS KNIFE
THIS GENTLE KING HAD CAUGHT A GREAT MOTIFE BEEN GREATLY MOVED
OF THIS WITNESS AND THOUGHT HE WOULD INQUERE BY THE EVIDENCE
DEEPER INTO THIS CASE THE TRUTH TO LEAR LEARN
ALAS CONSTANCE THOU HAS NO CHAMPION
NOR FIGHTE CANST THOU NOT SO WELL AWAY
BUT HE THAT STARF FOR OUR REDEMPTION DIED
AND BOUND SATAN AND YET LI'TH WHERE HE LAY
SO BE THY STRONGE CHAMPION THIS DAY
FOR BUT CHRIST UPON THEE MIRACLE KITHE SHOW
WITHOUTE GUILT THOU SHALT BE SLAIN AS SWITHE IMMEDIATELY
SHE SET HER DOWN ON KNEES AND THUS SHE SAID
IMMORTAL GOD THAT SAVEDEST SUSANNE
FROM FALSE BLAME AND THOU MERCIFUL MAID
MARY I MEAN THE DAUGHTER TO SAINT ANNE
BEFORE WHOSE CHILD THE ANGELS SING OSANNE HOSANNA
IF I BE GUILTLESS OF THIS FELONY
MY SUCCOUR BE OR ELLES SHALL I DIE
HAVE YE NOT SEEN SOMETIME A PALE FACE
AMONG A PRESS OF HIM THAT HATH BEEN LAD LED
TOWARD HIS DEATH WHERE HE GETTETH NO GRACE
AND SUCH A COLOUR IN HIS FACE HATH HAD
MEN MIGHTE KNOW HIM THAT WAS SO BESTAD BESTED SITUATED
AMONGES ALL THE FACES IN THAT ROUT
SO STOOD CONSTANCE AND LOOKED HER ABOUT
O QUEENES LIVING IN PROSPERITY
DUCHESSES AND YE LADIES EVERY ONE
HAVE SOME RUTH ON HER ADVERSITY PITY
AN EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER SHE STOOD ALONE
SHE HAD NO WIGHT TO WHOM TO MAKE HER MOAN
O BLOOD ROYAL THAT STANDEST IN THIS DREDE DANGER
FAR BE THY FRIENDES IN THY GREATE NEED
THIS KING ALLA HAD SUCH COMPASSIOUN
AS GENTLE HEART IS FULL FILLED OF PITY
THAT FROM HIS EYEN RAN THE WATER DOWN
NOW HASTILY DO FETCH A BOOK QUOTH HE
AND IF THIS KNIGHT WILL SWEARE HOW THAT SHE
THIS WOMAN SLEW YET WILL WE US ADVISE CONSIDER
WHOM THAT WE WILL THAT SHALL BE OUR JUSTICE
A BRITON BOOK WRITTEN WITH EVANGILES THE GOSPELS
WAS FETCHED AND ON THIS BOOK HE SWORE ANON
SHE GUILTY WAS AND IN THE MEANEWHILES
AN HAND HIM SMOTE UPON THE NECKE BONE
THAT DOWN HE FELL AT ONCE RIGHT AS A STONE
AND BOTH HIS EYEN BURST OUT OF HIS FACE
IN SIGHT OF EV'RYBODY IN THAT PLACE
A VOICE WAS HEARD IN GENERAL AUDIENCE
THAT SAID THOU HAST DESLANDER'D GUILTELESS
THE DAUGHTER OF HOLY CHURCH IN HIGH PRESENCE
THUS HAST THOU DONE AND YET HOLD I MY PEACE SHALL I BE SILENT
OF THIS MARVEL AGHAST WAS ALL THE PRESS

FOR DREAD OF WREAKE SAVE CONSTANCE ALONE
VENGEANCE
GREAT WAS THE DREAD AND EKE THE REPENTANCE
OF THEM THAT HADDE WRONG SUSPICION
UPON THIS SELY INNOCENT CONSTANCE SIMPLE HARMLESS
AND FOR THIS MIRACLE IN CONCLUSION
AND BY CONSTANCE'S MEDIATION
THE KING AND MANY ANOTHER IN THAT PLACE
CONVERTED WAS THANKED BE CHRISTE'S GRACE
THIS FALSE KNIGHT WAS SLAIN FOR HIS UNTRUTH
BY JUDGEMENT OF ALLA HASTILY
AND YET CONSTANCE HAD OF HIS DEATH GREAT RUTH COMPASSION
AND AFTER THIS JESUS OF HIS MERCY

SO FULL OF SIN IS MANY A CREATURE
O MIGHTY GOD IF THAT IT BE THY WILL
SINCE THOU ART RIGHTFUL JUDGE HOW MAY IT BE
THAT THOU WILT SUFFER INNOCENCE TO SPILL BE DESTROYED
AND WICKED FOLK REIGN IN PROSPERITY
AH GOOD CONSTANCE ALAS SO WOE IS ME
THAT I MUST BE THY TORMENTOR OR DEY DIE
A SHAMEFUL DEATH THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
WEPT BOTHE YOUNG AND OLD IN ALL THAT PLACE
WHEN THAT THE KING THIS CURSED LETTER SENT
AND CONSTANCE WITH A DEADLY PALE FACE
THE FOURTHE DAY TOWARD HER SHIP SHE WENT
BUT NATHELESS SHE TOOK IN GOOD INTENT
THE WILL OF CHRIST AND KNEELING ON THE STROND STRAND SHORE
SHE SAIDE LORD AYE WELCOME BE THY SOND WHATEVER THOU SENDEST
HE THAT ME KEPTE FROM THE FALSE BLAME
WHILE I WAS IN THE LAND AMONGES YOU
HE CAN ME KEEP FROM HARM AND EKE FROM SHAME
IN THE SALT SEA ALTHOUGH I SEE NOT HOW
AS STRONG AS EVER HE WAS HE IS YET NOW
IN HIM TRUST I AND IN HIS MOTHER DERE
THAT IS TO ME MY SAIL AND EKE MY STERE RUDDER GUIDE
HER LITTLE CHILD LAY WEEPING IN HER ARM
AND KNEELING PITEOUSLY TO HIM SHE SAID
PEACE LITTLE SON I WILL DO THEE NO HARM
WITH THAT HER KERCHIEF OFF HER HEAD SHE BRAID TOOK DREW
AND OVER HIS LITTLE EYEN SHE IT LAID
AND IN HER ARM SHE LULLED IT FULL FAST
AND UNTO HEAV'N HER EYEN UP SHE CAST
MOTHER QUOTH SHE AND MAIDEN BRIGHT MARY
SOOTH IS THAT THROUGH A WOMAN'S EGGEMENT INCITEMENT EGGING ON
MANKIND WAS LORN AND DAMNED AYE TO DIE LOST
FOR WHICH THY CHILD WAS ON A CROSS Y RENT TORN PIERCED
THY BLISSFUL EYEN SAW ALL HIS TORMENT
THEN IS THERE NO COMPARISON BETWEEN
THY WOE AND ANY WOE MAN MAY SUSTENE
THOU SAW'ST THY CHILD Y SLAIN BEFORE THINE EYEN
AND YET NOW LIVES MY LITTLE CHILD PARFAY BY MY FAITH
NOW LADY BRIGHT TO WHOM THE WOEFUL CRYEN
THOU GLORY OF WOMANHOOD THOU FAIRE MAY MAID
THOU HAVEN OF REFUGE BRIGHT STAR OF DAY
RUE ON MY CHILD THAT OF THY GENTLENESS TAKE PITY
RUEST ON EVERY RUEFUL IN DISTRESS
SORROWFUL PERSON
O LITTLE CHILD ALAS WHAT IS THY GUILT
THAT NEVER WROUGHTEST SIN AS YET PARDIE PAR DIEU BY GOD
WHY WILL THINE HARDE FATHER HAVE THEE SPILT CRUEL DESTROYED
O MERCY DEARE CONSTABLE QUOTH SHE
AND LET MY LITTLE CHILD HERE DWELL WITH THEE
AND IF THOU DAR'ST NOT SAVE HIM FROM BLAME
SO KISS HIM ONES IN HIS FATHER'S NAME
THEREWITH SHE LOOKED BACKWARD TO THE LAND
AND SAIDE FAREWELL HUSBAND RUTHELESS
AND UP SHE ROSE AND WALKED DOWN THE STRAND
TOWARD THE SHIP HER FOLLOWING ALL THE PRESS MULTITUDE
AND EVER SHE PRAY'D HER CHILD TO HOLD HIS PEACE
AND TOOK HER LEAVE AND WITH AN HOLY INTENT
SHE BLESSED HER AND TO THE SHIP SHE WENT
VICTUALED WAS THE SHIP IT IS NO DREDE DOUBT
ABUNDANTLY FOR HER A FULL LONG SPACE
AND OTHER NECESSARIES THAT SHOULD NEED BE NEEDED
SHE HAD ENOUGH HERIED BE GODDE'S GRACE PRAISED 15
FOR WIND AND WEATHER ALMIGHTY GOD PURCHASE PROVIDE
AND BRING HER HOME I CAN NO BETTER SAY
BUT IN THE SEA SHE DRIVED FORTH HER WAY
ALLA THE KING CAME HOME SOON AFTER THIS
UNTO THE CASTLE OF THE WHICH I TOLD
AND ASKED WHERE HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILD IS
THE CONSTABLE GAN ABOUT HIS HEART FEEL COLD
AND PLAINLY ALL THE MATTER HE HIM TOLD
AS YE HAVE HEARD I CAN TELL IT NO BETTER
AND SHEW'D THE KING HIS SEAL AND EKE HIS LETTER
AND SAIDE LORD AS YE COMMANDED ME
ON PAIN OF DEATH SO HAVE I DONE CERTAIN
THE MESSENGER TORMENTED WAS TILL HE TORTURED
MUSTE BEKNOW AND TELL IT FLAT AND PLAIN CONFESS 16
FROM NIGHT TO NIGHT IN WHAT PLACE HE HAD LAIN
AND THUS BY WIT AND SUBTLE INQUIRING
IMAGIN'D WAS BY WHOM THIS HARM GAN SPRING
THE HAND WAS KNOWN THAT HAD THE LETTER WROTE
AND ALL THE VENOM OF THE CURSED DEED
BUT IN WHAT WISE CERTAINLY I KNOW NOT
TH' EFFECT IS THIS THAT ALLA OUT OF DREDE WITHOUT DOUBT
HIS MOTHER SLEW THAT MAY MEN PLAINLY READ
FOR THAT SHE TRAITOR WAS TO HER LIEGEANCE ALLEGIANCE
THUS ENDED OLDE DONEGILD WITH MISCHANCE
THE SORROW THAT THIS ALLA NIGHT AND DAY
MADE FOR HIS WIFE AND FOR HIS CHILD ALSO
THERE IS NO TONGUE THAT IT TELLE MAY
BUT NOW WILL I AGAIN TO CONSTANCE GO
THAT FLOATED IN THE SEA IN PAIN AND WOE
FIVE YEAR AND MORE AS LIKED CHRISTE'S SOND DECREE COMMAND
ERE THAT HER SHIP APPROACHED TO THE LOND LAND
UNDER AN HEATHEN CASTLE AT THE LAST
OF WHICH THE NAME IN MY TEXT I NOT FIND
CONSTANCE AND EKE HER CHILD THE SEA UPCAST
ALMIGHTY GOD THAT SAVED ALL MANKIND
HAVE ON CONSTANCE AND ON HER CHILD SOME MIND
THAT FALLEN IS IN HEATHEN HAND EFTSOON AGAIN
IN POINT TO SPILL AS I SHALL TELL YOU SOON IN DANGER OF
PERISHING
DOWN FROM THE CASTLE CAME THERE MANY A WIGHT
TO GAUREN ON THIS SHIP AND ON CONSTANCE GAZE STARE
BUT SHORTLY FROM THE CASTLE ON A NIGHT
THE LORDE'S STEWARD GOD GIVE HIM MISCHANCE
A THIEF THAT HAD RENIED OUR CREANCE DENIED OUR FAITH
CAME TO THE SHIP ALONE AND SAID HE WOULD
HER LEMAN BE WHETHER SHE WOULD OR N'OULD
ILLICIT LOVER
WOE WAS THIS WRETCHED WOMAN THEN BEGONE
HER CHILD CRI'D AND SHE CRIED PITEOUSLY
BUT BLISSFUL MARY HELP'D HER RIGHT ANON
FOR WITH HER STRUGGLING WELL AND MIGHTILY
THE THIEF FELL OVERBOARD ALL SUDDENLY
AND IN THE SEA HE DRENCHED FOR VENGEANCE DROWNED
AND THUS HATH CHRIST UNWEMMED KEPT CONSTANCE
UNBLEMISHED
O FOUL LUST OF LUXURY LO THINE END
NOT ONLY THAT THOU FAINTEST MANNE'S MIND WEAKENEST
BUT VERILY THOU WILT HIS BODY SHEND DESTROY
TH' END OF THY WORK OR OF THY LUSTES BLIND
IS COMPLAINING HOW MANY MAY MEN FIND
THAT NOT FOR WORK SOMETIMES BUT FOR TH' INTENT
TO DO THIS SIN BE EITHER SLAIN OR SHENT
HOW MAY THIS WEAKE WOMAN HAVE THE STRENGTH
HER TO DEFEND AGAINST THIS RENEGATE
O GOLIATH UNMEASURABLE OF LENGTH
HOW MIGHTE DAVID MAKE THEE SO MATE OVERTHROWN
SO YOUNG AND OF ARMOUR SO DESOLATE DEVOID
HOW DURST HE LOOK UPON THY DREADFUL FACE
WELL MAY MEN SEE IT WAS BUT GODDE'S GRACE
WHO GAVE JUDITH COURAGE OR HARDINESS
TO SLAY HIM HOLOFERNES IN HIS TENT
AND TO DELIVER OUT OF WRETCHEDNESS
THE PEOPLE OF GOD I SAY FOR THIS INTENT
THAT RIGHT AS GOD SPIRIT OF VIGOUR SENT
TO THEM AND SAVED THEM OUT OF MISCHANCE
SO SENT HE MIGHT AND VIGOUR TO CONSTANCE
FORTH WENT HER SHIP THROUGHOUT THE NARROW MOUTH
OF JUBALTARE AND SEPTE DRIVING ALWAY GIBRALTAR AND CEUTA
SOMETIME WEST AND SOMETIME NORTH AND SOUTH
AND SOMETIME EAST FULL MANY A WEARY DAY
TILL CHRISTE'S MOTHER BLESSED BE SHE AYE
HAD SHAPED THROUGH HER ENDELESS GOODNESS RESOLVED ARRANGED
TO MAKE AN END OF ALL HER HEAVINESS
NOW LET US STINT OF CONSTANCE BUT A THROW CEASE SPEAKING
AND SPEAK WE OF THE ROMAN EMPEROR SHORT TIME
THAT OUT OF SYRIA HAD BY LETTERS KNOW
THE SLAUGHTER OF CHRISTIAN FOLK AND DISHONOR
DONE TO HIS DAUGHTER BY A FALSE TRAITOR
I MEAN THE CURSED WICKED SOUDANESS
THAT AT THE FEAST LET SLAY BOTH MORE AND LESS CAUSED BOTH HIGH
AND LOW TO BE KILLED
FOR WHICH THIS EMPEROR HAD SENT ANON
HIS SENATOR WITH ROYAL ORDINANCE
AND OTHER LORDES GOD WOT MANY A ONE
ON SYRIANS TO TAKE HIGH VENGEANCE
THEY BURN AND SLAY AND BRING THEM TO MISCHANCE
FULL MANY A DAY BUT SHORTLY THIS IS TH' END
HOMEWARD TO ROME THEY SHAPED THEM TO WEND
THIS SENATOR REPAIRED WITH VICTORY
TO ROME WARD SAILING FULL ROYALLY
AND MET THE SHIP DRIVING AS SAITH THE STORY
IN WHICH CONSTANCE SAT FULL PITEOUSLY
AND NOTHING KNEW HE WHAT SHE WAS NOR WHY
SHE WAS IN SUCH ARRAY NOR SHE WILL SAY
OF HER ESTATE ALTHOUGH THAT SHE SHOULD DEY DIE
HE BROUGHT HER UNTO ROME AND TO HIS WIFE
HE GAVE HER AND HER YOUNGE SON ALSO
AND WITH THE SENATOR SHE LED HER LIFE
THUS CAN OUR LADY BRINGEN OUT OF WOE
WOEFUL CONSTANCE AND MANY ANOTHER MO'
AND LONGE TIME SHE DWELLED IN THAT PLACE
IN HOLY WORKS EVER AS WAS HER GRACE
THE SENATORES WIFE HER AUNTE WAS
BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE KNEW HER NE'ER THE MORE
I WILL NO LONGER TARRY IN THIS CASE
BUT TO KING ALLA WHOM I SPAKE OF YORE
THAT FOR HIS WIFE WEPT AND SIGHED SORE
I WILL RETURN AND LEAVE I WILL CONSTANCE
UNDER THE SENATORES GOVERNANCE
KING ALLA WHICH THAT HAD HIS MOTHER SLAIN
UPON A DAY FELL IN SUCH REPENTANCE
THAT IF I SHORTLY TELL IT SHALL AND PLAIN
TO ROME HE CAME TO RECEIVE HIS PENITANCE
AND PUT HIM IN THE POPE'S ORDINANCE
IN HIGH AND LOW AND JESUS CHRIST BESOUGHT
FORGIVE HIS WICKED WORKS THAT HE HAD WROUGHT
THE FAME ANON THROUGHOUT THE TOWN IS BORNE
HOW ALLA KING SHALL COME ON PILGRIMAGE
BY HARBINGERS THAT WENTE HIM BEFORN
FOR WHICH THE SENATOR AS WAS USAGE
RODE HIM AGAIN AND MANY OF HIS LINEAGE TO MEET HIM
AS WELL TO SHOW HIS HIGH MAGNIFICENCE
AS TO DO ANY KING A REVERENCE
GREAT CHEERE DID THIS NOBLE SENATOR COURTESY
TO KING ALLA AND HE TO HIM ALSO
EACH OF THEM DID THE OTHER GREAT HONOR
AND SO BEFELL THAT IN A DAY OR TWO
THIS SENATOR DID TO KING ALLA GO
TO FEAST AND SHORTLY IF I SHALL NOT LIE
CONSTANCE'S SON WENT IN HIS COMPANY
SOME MEN WOULD SAY 17 AT REQUEST OF CONSTANCE
THIS SENATOR HAD LED THIS CHILD TO FEAST
I MAY NOT TELLEN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE
BE AS BE MAY THERE WAS HE AT THE LEAST
BUT SOOTH IS THIS THAT AT HIS MOTHER'S HEST BEHEST
BEFORE ALLA DURING THE MEATES SPACE MEAL TIME
THE CHILD STOOD LOOKING IN THE KINGES FACE
THIS ALLA KING HAD OF THIS CHILD GREAT WONDER
AND TO THE SENATOR HE SAID ANON
WHOSE IS THAT FAIRE CHILD THAT STANDETH YONDER
I N'OT QUOTH HE BY GOD AND BY SAINT JOHN KNOW NOT
A MOTHER HE HATH BUT FATHER HATH HE NONE
THAT I OF WOT AND SHORTLY IN A STOUND SHORT TIME 18
HE TOLD TO ALLA HOW THIS CHILD WAS FOUND
BUT GOD WOT QUOTH THIS SENATOR ALSO
SO VIRTUOUS A LIVER IN ALL MY LIFE
I NEVER SAW AS SHE NOR HEARD OF MO'
OF WORLDLY WOMAN MAIDEN WIDOW OR WIFE
I DARE WELL SAY SHE HADDE LEVER A KNIFE RATHER
THROUGHOUT HER BREAST THAN BE A WOMAN WICK' WICKED
THERE IS NO MAN COULD BRING HER TO THAT PRICK POINT
NOW WAS THIS CHILD AS LIKE UNTO CONSTANCE
AS POSSIBLE IS A CREATURE TO BE
THIS ALLA HAD THE FACE IN REMEMBRANCE
OF DAME CONSTANCE AND THEREON MUSED HE
IF THAT THE CHILDE'S MOTHER WERE AUGHT SHE COULD BE SHE
THAT WAS HIS WIFE AND PRIVILY HE SIGHT SIGHED
AND SPED HIM FROM THE TABLE THAT HE MIGHT AS FAST AS HE COULD
PARFAY THOUGHT HE PHANTOM IS IN MINE HEAD
BY MY FAITH
I OUGHT TO DEEM OF SKILFUL JUDGEMENT A FANTASY
THAT IN THE SALTE SEA MY WIFE IS DEAD
AND AFTERWARD HE MADE HIS ARGUMENT
WHAT WOT I IF THAT CHRIST HAVE HITHER SENT
MY WIFE BY SEA AS WELL AS HE HER SENT
TO MY COUNTRY FROM THENNES THAT SHE WENT
AND AFTER NOON HOME WITH THE SENATOR
WENT ALLA FOR TO SEE THIS WONDROUS CHANCE
THIS SENATOR DID ALLA GREAT HONOR
AND HASTILY HE SENT AFTER CONSTANCE
BUT TRUSTE WELL HER LISTE NOT TO DANCE
WHEN THAT SHE WISTE WHEREFORE WAS THAT SOND SUMMONS
UNNETH UPON HER FEET SHE MIGHTE STAND
WITH DIFFICULTY
WHEN ALLA SAW HIS WIFE FAIR HE HER GRET GREETED
AND WEPT THAT IT WAS RUTHE FOR TO SEE
FOR AT THE FIRSTE LOOK HE ON HER SET
HE KNEW WELL VERILY THAT IT WAS SHE
AND SHE FOR SORROW AS DUMB STOOD AS A TREE
SO WAS HER HEARTE SHUT IN HER DISTRESS
WHEN SHE REMEMBER'D HIS UNKINDENESS
TWICE SHE SWOONED IN HIS OWEN SIGHT
HE WEPT AND HIM EXCUSED PITEOUSLY
NOW GOD QUOTH HE AND ALL HIS HALLOWS BRIGHT SAINTS
SO WISLY ON MY SOULE HAVE MERCY SURELY
THAT OF YOUR HARM AS GUILTELESS AM I
AS IS MAURICE MY SON SO LIKE YOUR FACE
ELSE MAY THE FIEND ME FETCH OUT OF THIS PLACE
LONG WAS THE SOBBING AND THE BITTER PAIN
ERE THAT THEIR WOEFUL HEARTES MIGHTE CEASE
GREAT WAS THE PITY FOR TO HEAR THEM PLAIN LAMENT
THROUGH WHICHE PLAINTES GAN THEIR WOE INCREASE
I PRAY YOU ALL MY LABOUR TO RELEASE
I MAY NOT TELL ALL THEIR WOE TILL TO MORROW
I AM SO WEARY FOR TO SPEAK OF SORROW
BUT FINALLY WHEN THAT THE SOOTH IS WIST TRUTH IS KNOWN
THAT ALLA GUILTLESS WAS OF ALL HER WOE
I TROW AN HUNDRED TIMES HAVE THEY KISS'D
AND SUCH A BLISS IS THERE BETWIXT THEM TWO
THAT SAVE THE JOY THAT LASTETH EVERMO'
THERE IS NONE LIKE THAT ANY CREATURE
HATH SEEN OR SHALL SEE WHILE THE WORLD MAY DURE
THEN PRAYED SHE HER HUSBAND MEEKELY
IN THE RELIEF OF HER LONG PITEOUS PINE SORROW
THAT HE WOULD PRAY HER FATHER SPECIALLY
THAT OF HIS MAJESTY HE WOULD INCLINE
TO VOUCHESAFE SOME DAY WITH HIM TO DINE
SHE PRAY'D HIM EKE THAT HE SHOULD BY NO WAY
UNTO HER FATHER NO WORD OF HER SAY
SOME MEN WOULD SAY 17 HOW THAT THE CHILD MAURICE
DID THIS MESSAGE UNTO THE EMPEROR
BUT AS I GUESS ALLA WAS NOT SO NICE FOOLISH
TO HIM THAT IS SO SOVEREIGN OF HONOR
AS HE THAT IS OF CHRISTIAN FOLK THE FLOW'R
SEND ANY CHILD BUT BETTER 'TIS TO DEEM
HE WENT HIMSELF AND SO IT MAY WELL SEEM
THIS EMPEROR HATH GRANTED GENTILLY
TO COME TO DINNER AS HE HIM BESOUGHT
AND WELL REDE I HE LOOKED BUSILY GUESS KNOW
UPON THIS CHILD AND ON HIS DAUGHTER THOUGHT
ALLA WENT TO HIS INN AND AS HIM OUGHT
ARRAYED FOR THIS FEAST IN EVERY WISE PREPARED
AS FARFORTH AS HIS CUNNING MAY SUFFICE
AS FAR AS HIS SKILL
THE MORROW CAME AND ALLA GAN HIM DRESS MAKE READY
AND EKE HIS WIFE THE EMPEROR TO MEET
AND FORTH THEY RODE IN JOY AND IN GLADNESS
AND WHEN SHE SAW HER FATHER IN THE STREET
SHE LIGHTED DOWN AND FELL BEFORE HIS FEET
FATHER QUOTH SHE YOUR YOUNGE CHILD CONSTANCE
IS NOW FULL CLEAN OUT OF YOUR REMEMBRANCE
I AM YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR CONSTANCE QUOTH SHE
THAT WHILOM YE HAVE SENT INTO SYRIE
IT AM I FATHER THAT IN THE SALT SEA
WAS PUT ALONE AND DAMNED FOR TO DIE
CONDEMNED
NOW GOODE FATHER I YOU MERCY CRY
SEND ME NO MORE INTO NONE HEATHENESS
BUT THANK MY LORD HERE OF HIS KINDENESS
WHO CAN THE PITEOUS JOYE TELLEN ALL
BETWIXT THEM THREE SINCE THEY BE THUS Y MET
BUT OF MY TALE MAKE AN END I SHALL
THE DAY GOES FAST I WILL NO LONGER LET HINDER
THESE GLADDE FOLK TO DINNER BE Y SET
IN JOY AND BLISS AT MEAT I LET THEM DWELL
A THOUSAND FOLD WELL MORE THAN I CAN TELL
THIS CHILD MAURICE WAS SINCE THEN EMPEROR
MADE BY THE POPE AND LIVED CHRISTIANLY
TO CHRISTE'S CHURCHE DID HE GREAT HONOR
BUT I LET ALL HIS STORY PASSE BY
OF CONSTANCE IS MY TALE ESPECIALLY
IN THE OLDE ROMAN GESTES MEN MAY FIND HISTORIES 19
MAURICE'S LIFE I BEAR IT NOT IN MIND
THIS KING ALLA WHEN HE HIS TIME SEY SAW
WITH HIS CONSTANCE HIS HOLY WIFE SO SWEET
TO ENGLAND ARE THEY COME THE RIGHTE WAY
WHERE THEY DID LIVE IN JOY AND IN QUIET
BUT LITTLE WHILE IT LASTED I YOU HETE PROMISE
JOY OF THIS WORLD FOR TIME WILL NOT ABIDE
FROM DAY TO NIGHT IT CHANGETH AS THE TIDE
WHO LIV'D EVER IN SUCH DELIGHT ONE DAY
THAT HIM NOT MOVED EITHER CONSCIENCE
OR IRE OR TALENT OR SOME KIND AFFRAY SOME KIND OF DISTURBANCE
ENVY OR PRIDE OR PASSION OR OFFENCE
I SAY BUT FOR THIS ENDE THIS SENTENCE JUDGMENT OPINION
THAT LITTLE WHILE IN JOY OR IN PLEASANCE
LASTED THE BLISS OF ALLA WITH CONSTANCE
FOR DEATH THAT TAKES OF HIGH AND LOW HIS RENT
WHEN PASSED WAS A YEAR EVEN AS I GUESS
OUT OF THIS WORLD THIS KING ALLA HE HENT SNATCHED
FOR WHOM CONSTANCE HAD FULL GREAT HEAVINESS
NOW LET US PRAY THAT GOD HIS SOULE BLESS
AND DAME CONSTANCE FINALLY TO SAY
TOWARD THE TOWN OF ROME WENT HER WAY
TO ROME IS COME THIS HOLY CREATURE
AND FINDETH THERE HER FRIENDES WHOLE AND SOUND
NOW IS SHE SCAPED ALL HER AVENTURE
AND WHEN THAT SHE HER FATHER HATH Y FOUND
DOWN ON HER KNEES FALLETH SHE TO GROUND
WEEPING FOR TENDERNESS IN HEARTE BLITHE
SHE HERIETH GOD AN HUNDRED THOUSAND SITHE PRAISES TIMES
IN VIRTUE AND IN HOLY ALMES DEED
THEY LIVEN ALL AND NE'ER ASUNDER WEND
TILL DEATH DEPARTETH THEM THIS LIFE THEY LEAD
AND FARE NOW WELL MY TALE IS AT AN END
NOW JESUS CHRIST THAT OF HIS MIGHT MAY SEND
JOY AFTER WOE GOVERN US IN HIS GRACE
AND KEEP US ALLE THAT BE IN THIS PLACE

THIS TALE IS BELIEVED BY TYRWHITT TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN WITH NO
MATERIAL CHANGE FROM THE CONFESSIO AMANTIS OF JOHN GOWER
WHO WAS CONTEMPORARY WITH CHAUCER THOUGH SOMEWHAT HIS
SENIOR
IN THE PROLOGUE THE REFERENCES TO THE STORIES OF CANACE
AND OF APOLLONIUS TYRIUS SEEM TO BE AN ATTACK ON GOWER WHO
HAD GIVEN THESE TALES IN HIS BOOK WHENCE TYRWHITT CONCLUDES
THAT THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO POETS SUFFERED SOME
INTERRUPTION IN THE LATTER PART OF THEIR LIVES
GOWER WAS NOT THE
INVENTOR OF THE STORY WHICH HE FOUND IN OLD FRENCH ROMANCES
AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT CHAUCER MAY HAVE GONE TO THE
SAME SOURCE AS GOWER THOUGH THE LATTER UNDOUBTEDLY LED THE
WAY

THANKED BE GOD THAT IS ETERN ON LIVE LIVES ETERNALLY
HUSBANDS AT THE CHURCH DOOR HAVE I HAD FIVE 2
FOR I SO OFTEN HAVE Y WEDDED BE
AND ALL WERE WORTHY MEN IN THEIR DEGREE
BUT ME WAS TOLD NOT LONGE TIME GONE IS
THAT SITHEN CHRISTE WENT NEVER BUT ONES SINCE
TO WEDDING IN THE CANE OF GALILEE CANA
THAT BY THAT ILK EXAMPLE TAUGHT HE ME SAME
THAT I NOT WEDDED SHOULDE BE BUT ONCE
LO HEARKEN EKE A SHARP WORD FOR THE NONCE OCCASION
BESIDE A WELLE JESUS GOD AND MAN
SPAKE IN REPROOF OF THE SAMARITAN
THOU HAST Y HAD FIVE HUSBANDES SAID HE
AND THILKE MAN THAT NOW HATH WEDDED THEE THAT
IS NOT THINE HUSBAND 3 THUS SAID HE CERTAIN
WHAT THAT HE MEANT THEREBY I CANNOT SAYN
BUT THAT I ASKE WHY THE FIFTHE MAN
WAS NOT HUSBAND TO THE SAMARITAN
HOW MANY MIGHT SHE HAVE IN MARRIAGE
YET HEARD I NEVER TELLEN IN MINE AGE IN MY LIFE
UPON THIS NUMBER DEFINITIOUN
MEN MAY DIVINE AND GLOSEN UP AND DOWN COMMENT
BUT WELL I WOT EXPRESS WITHOUT A LIE
GOD BADE US FOR TO WAX AND MULTIPLY
THAT GENTLE TEXT CAN I WELL UNDERSTAND
EKE WELL I WOT HE SAID THAT MINE HUSBAND
SHOULD LEAVE FATHER AND MOTHER AND TAKE TO ME
BUT OF NO NUMBER MENTION MADE HE
OF BIGAMY OR OF OCTOGAMY
WHY THEN SHOULD MEN SPEAK OF IT VILLAINY AS IF IT WERE A DISGRACE
LO HERE THE WISE KING DAN SOLOMON LORD 4
I TROW THAT HE HAD WIVES MORE THAN ONE
AS WOULD TO GOD IT LAWFUL WERE TO ME
TO BE REFRESHED HALF SO OFT AS HE
WHAT GIFT OF GOD HAD HE FOR ALL HIS WIVES SPECIAL FAVOUR LICENCE
NO MAN HATH SUCH THAT IN THIS WORLD ALIVE IS
GOD WOT THIS NOBLE KING AS TO MY WIT AS I UNDERSTAND
THE FIRST NIGHT HAD MANY A MERRY FIT
WITH EACH OF THEM SO WELL WAS HIM ON LIVE SO WELL HE LIVED
BLESSED BE GOD THAT I HAVE WEDDED FIVE
WELCOME THE SIXTH WHENEVER THAT HE SHALL
FOR SINCE I WILL NOT KEEP ME CHASTE IN ALL
WHEN MINE HUSBAND IS FROM THE WORLD Y GONE
SOME CHRISTIAN MAN SHALL WEDDE ME ANON
FOR THEN TH' APOSTLE SAITH THAT I AM FREE
TO WED A' GOD'S HALF WHERE IT LIKETH ME
ON GOD'S PART
HE SAITH THAT TO BE WEDDED IS NO SIN
BETTER IS TO BE WEDDED THAN TO BRIN BURN
WHAT RECKETH ME THOUGH FOLK SAY VILLAINY CARE EVIL
OF SHREWED LAMECH AND HIS BIGAMY IMPIOUS WICKED
I WOT WELL ABRAHAM WAS A HOLY MAN
AND JACOB EKE AS FAR AS EV'R I CAN KNOW
AND EACH OF THEM HAD WIVES MORE THAN TWO
AND MANY ANOTHER HOLY MAN ALSO
WHERE CAN YE SEE IN ANY MANNER AGE IN ANY PERIOD
THAT HIGHE GOD DEFENDED MARRIAGE FORBADE 5
BY WORD EXPRESS I PRAY YOU TELL IT ME
OR WHERE COMMANDED HE VIRGINITY
I WOT AS WELL AS YOU IT IS NO DREAD DOUBT
TH' APOSTLE WHEN HE SPAKE OF MAIDENHEAD
HE SAID THAT PRECEPT THEREOF HAD HE NONE
MEN MAY COUNSEL A WOMAN TO BE ONE A MAID
BUT COUNSELING IS NO COMMANDEMENT
HE PUT IT IN OUR OWEN JUDGEMENT
FOR HADDE GOD COMMANDED MAIDENHEAD
THEN HAD HE DAMNED WEDDING OUT OF DREAD CONDEMNED DOUBT
AND CERTES IF THERE WERE NO SEED Y SOW SOWN
VIRGINITY THEN WHEREOF SHOULD IT GROW
PAUL DURSTE NOT COMMANDEN AT THE LEAST
A THING OF WHICH HIS MASTER GAVE NO HEST COMMAND
THE DART IS SET UP FOR VIRGINITY GOAL 6
CATCH WHOSO MAY WHO RUNNETH BEST LET SEE
BUT THIS WORD IS NOT TA'EN OF EVERY WIGHT
BUT THERE AS GOD WILL GIVE IT OF HIS MIGHT
EXCEPT WHERE
I WOT WELL THAT TH' APOSTLE WAS A MAID
BUT NATHELESS ALTHOUGH HE WROTE AND SAID
HE WOULD THAT EVERY WIGHT WERE SUCH AS HE
ALL IS BUT COUNSEL TO VIRGINITY
AND SINCE TO BE A WIFE HE GAVE ME LEAVE
OF INDULGENCE SO IS IT NO REPREVE SCANDAL REPROACH
TO WEDDE ME IF THAT MY MAKE SHOULD DIE MATE HUSBAND
WITHOUT EXCEPTION OF BIGAMY CHARGE REPROACH
ALL WERE IT GOOD NO WOMAN FOR TO TOUCH THOUGH IT MIGHT BE
HE MEANT AS IN HIS BED OR IN HIS COUCH
FOR PERIL IS BOTH FIRE AND TOW T'ASSEMBLE
YE KNOW WHAT THIS EXAMPLE MAY RESEMBLE
THIS IS ALL AND SOME HE HELD VIRGINITY
MORE PROFIT THAN WEDDING IN FRAILTY
FRAILTY CLEPE I BUT IF THAT HE AND SHE FRAILTY I CALL IT
WOULD LEAD THEIR LIVES ALL IN CHASTITY UNLESS
I GRANT IT WELL I HAVE OF NONE ENVY
WHO MAIDENHEAD PREFER TO BIGAMY
IT LIKETH THEM T' BE CLEAN IN BODY AND GHOST SOUL
OF MINE ESTATE I WILL NOT MAKE A BOAST
CONDITION
FOR WELL YE KNOW A LORD IN HIS HOUSEHOLD
HATH NOT EVERY VESSEL ALL OF GOLD 7
SOME ARE OF TREE AND DO THEIR LORD SERVICE
GOD CALLETH FOLK TO HIM IN SUNDRY WISE
AND EACH ONE HATH OF GOD A PROPER GIFT
SOME THIS SOME THAT AS LIKETH HIM TO SHIFT APPOINT DISTRIBUTE
VIRGINITY IS GREAT PERFECTION
AND CONTINENCE EKE WITH DEVOTION
BUT CHRIST THAT OF PERFECTION IS THE WELL FOUNTAIN
BADE NOT EVERY WIGHT HE SHOULD GO SELL
ALL THAT HE HAD AND GIVE IT TO THE POOR
AND IN SUCH WISE FOLLOW HIM AND HIS LORE DOCTRINE
HE SPAKE TO THEM THAT WOULD LIVE PERFECTLY
AND LORDINGS BY YOUR LEAVE THAT AM NOT I
I WILL BESTOW THE FLOWER OF MINE AGE
IN TH' ACTS AND IN THE FRUITS OF MARRIAGE
TELL ME ALSO TO WHAT CONCLUSION END PURPOSE
WERE MEMBERS MADE OF GENERATION
AND OF SO PERFECT WISE A WIGHT Y WROUGHT BEING
TRUST ME RIGHT WELL THEY WERE NOT MADE FOR NOUGHT
GLOSE WHOSO WILL AND SAY BOTH UP AND DOWN
THAT THEY WERE MADE FOR THE PURGATIOUN
OF URINE AND OF OTHER THINGES SMALE
AND EKE TO KNOW A FEMALE FROM A MALE
AND FOR NONE OTHER CAUSE SAY YE NO
EXPERIENCE WOT WELL IT IS NOT SO
SO THAT THE CLERKES BE NOT WITH ME WROTH SCHOLARS
I SAY THIS THAT THEY WERE MADE FOR BOTH
THAT IS TO SAY FOR OFFICE AND FOR EASE FOR DUTY AND
OF ENGENDRURE THERE WE GOD NOT DISPLEASE
FOR PLEASURE
WHY SHOULD MEN ELLES IN THEIR BOOKES SET
THAT MAN SHALL YIELD UNTO HIS WIFE HER DEBT
NOW WHEREWITH SHOULD HE MAKE HIS PAYEMENT
IF HE US'D NOT HIS SILLY INSTRUMENT
THEN WERE THEY MADE UPON A CREATURE
TO PURGE URINE AND EKE FOR ENGENDRURE
BUT I SAY NOT THAT EVERY WIGHT IS HOLD OBLIGED
THAT HATH SUCH HARNESS AS I TO YOU TOLD EQUIPMENT
TO GO AND USE THEM IN ENGENDRURE
THEN SHOULD MEN TAKE OF CHASTITY NO CURE CARE
CHRIST WAS A MAID AND SHAPEN AS A MAN FASHIONED
AND MANY A SAINT SINCE THAT THIS WORLD BEGAN
YET EVER LIV'D IN PERFECT CHASTITY
I WILL NOT VIE WITH NO VIRGINITY
CONTEND
LET THEM WITH BREAD OF PURED WHEAT BE FED PURIFIED
AND LET US WIVES EAT OUR BARLEY BREAD
AND YET WITH BARLEY BREAD MARK TELL US CAN 8
OUR LORD JESUS REFRESHED MANY A MAN
IN SUCH ESTATE AS GOD HATH CLEPED US CALLED US TO
I'LL PERSEVERE I AM NOT PRECIOUS OVER DAINTY
IN WIFEHOOD I WILL USE MINE INSTRUMENT
AS FREELY AS MY MAKER HATH IT SENT
IF I BE DANGEROUS GOD GIVE ME SORROW SPARING OF MY FAVOURS

WHEN THAT HIM LIST COME FORTH AND PAY HIS DEBT
A HUSBAND WILL I HAVE I WILL NO LET WILL BEAR NO HINDRANCE
WHICH SHALL BE BOTH MY DEBTOR AND MY THRALL SLAVE
AND HAVE HIS TRIBULATION WITHAL
UPON HIS FLESH WHILE THAT I AM HIS WIFE
I HAVE THE POWER DURING ALL MY LIFE
UPON HIS PROPER BODY AND NOT HE
RIGHT THUS TH' APOSTLE TOLD IT UNTO ME
AND BADE OUR HUSBANDS FOR TO LOVE US WELL

THEY WERE FULL GLAD TO EXCUSE THEM FULL BLIVE QUICKLY
OF THINGS THAT THEY NEVER AGUILT THEIR LIVE WERE GUILTY IN THEIR

OF WENCHES WOULD I BEARE THEM ON HAND FALSELY ACCUSE THEM
WHEN THAT FOR SICKNESS SCARCELY MIGHT THEY STAND
YET TICKLED I HIS HEARTE FOR THAT HE
WEEN'D THAT I HAD OF HIM SO GREAT CHERTE THOUGH AFFECTION 16

DECEIT WEEPING AND SPINNING GOD DOTH GIVE
TO WOMEN KINDLY WHILE THAT THEY MAY LIVE
NATURALLY
AND THUS OF ONE THING I MAY VAUNTE ME
AT TH' END I HAD THE BETTER IN EACH DEGREE
BY SLEIGHT OR FORCE OR BY SOME MANNER THING
AS BY CONTINUAL MURMUR OR GRUDGING COMPLAINING
NAMELY A BED THERE HADDE THEY MISCHANCE ESPECIALLY
THERE WOULD I CHIDE AND DO THEM NO PLEASANCE
I WOULD NO LONGER IN THE BED ABIDE
IF THAT I FELT HIS ARM OVER MY SIDE
TILL HE HAD MADE HIS RANSOM UNTO ME
THEN WOULD I SUFFER HIM DO HIS NICETY FOLLY 17
AND THEREFORE EVERY MAN THIS TALE I TELL
WIN WHOSO MAY FOR ALL IS FOR TO SELL
WITH EMPTY HAND MEN MAY NO HAWKES LURE
FOR WINNING WOULD I ALL HIS WILL ENDURE
AND MAKE ME A FEIGNED APPETITE
AND YET IN BACON HAD I NEVER DELIGHT I E
OF DUNMOW 9
THAT MADE ME THAT I EVER WOULD THEM CHIDE
FOR THOUGH THE POPE HAD SITTEN THEM BESIDE
I WOULD NOT SPARE THEM AT THEIR OWEN BOARD
FOR BY MY TROTH I QUIT THEM WORD FOR WORD REPAID
AS HELP ME VERY GOD OMNIPOTENT
THOUGH I RIGHT NOW SHOULD MAKE MY TESTAMENT
I OWE THEM NOT A WORD THAT IS NOT QUIT REPAID
I BROUGHT IT SO ABOUTE BY MY WIT

BUT I WILL KEEP IT FOR YOUR OWEN TOOTH
YE BE TO BLAME BY GOD I SAY YOU SOOTH
SUCH MANNER WORDES HADDE WE ON HAND
NOW WILL I SPEAKEN OF MY FOURTH HUSBAND
MY FOURTHE HUSBAND WAS A REVELLOUR
THIS IS TO SAY HE HAD A PARAMOUR
AND I WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF RAGERIE WANTONNESS
STUBBORN AND STRONG AND JOLLY AS A PIE MAGPIE
THEN COULD I DANCE TO A HARPE SMALE
AND SING Y WIS AS ANY NIGHTINGALE CERTAINLY
WHEN I HAD DRUNK A DRAUGHT OF SWEETE WINE
METELLIUS THE FOULE CHURL THE SWINE
THAT WITH A STAFF BEREFT HIS WIFE OF LIFE
FOR SHE DRANK WINE THOUGH I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE
NEVER SHOULD HE HAVE DAUNTED ME FROM DRINK
AND AFTER WINE OF VENUS MOST I THINK
FOR ALL SO SURE AS COLD ENGENDERS HAIL
A LIQUORISH MOUTH MUST HAVE A LIQUORISH TAIL
IN WOMAN VINOLENT IS NO DEFENCE FULL OF WINE RESISTANCE
THIS KNOWE LECHOURS BY EXPERIENCE
BUT LORD CHRIST WHEN THAT IT REMEMB'RETH ME
UPON MY YOUTH AND ON MY JOLLITY
IT TICKLETH ME ABOUT MINE HEARTE ROOT
UNTO THIS DAY IT DOTH MINE HEARTE BOOT GOOD
THAT I HAVE HAD MY WORLD AS IN MY TIME
BUT AGE ALAS THAT ALL WILL ENVENIME POISON EMBITTER
HATH ME BEREFT MY BEAUTY AND MY PITH VIGOUR
LET GO FAREWELL THE DEVIL GO THEREWITH
THE FLOUR IS GON THERE IS NO MORE TO TELL
THE BRAN AS I BEST MAY NOW MUST I SELL
BUT YET TO BE RIGHT MERRY WILL I FAND TRY
NOW FORTH TO TELL YOU OF MY FOURTH HUSBAND
I SAY I IN MY HEART HAD GREAT DESPITE
THAT HE OF ANY OTHER HAD DELIGHT
BUT HE WAS QUIT BY GOD AND BY SAINT JOCE 21 REQUITED PAID BACK
I MADE FOR HIM OF THE SAME WOOD A CROSS
NOT OF MY BODY IN NO FOUL MANNERE
BUT CERTAINLY I MADE FOLK SUCH CHEER
THAT IN HIS OWEN GREASE I MADE HIM FRY
FOR ANGER AND FOR VERY JEALOUSY
BY GOD IN EARTH I WAS HIS PURGATORY
FOR WHICH I HOPE HIS SOUL MAY BE IN GLORY
FOR GOD IT WOT HE SAT FULL OFT AND SUNG
WHEN THAT HIS SHOE FULL BITTERLY HIM WRUNG PINCHED
THERE WAS NO WIGHT SAVE GOD AND HE THAT WIST
IN MANY WISE HOW SORE I DID HIM TWIST 20
HE DIED WHEN I CAME FROM JERUSALEM
AND LIES IN GRAVE UNDER THE ROODE BEAM CROSS
ALTHOUGH HIS TOMB IS NOT SO CURIOUS
AS WAS THE SEPULCHRE OF DARIUS
WHICH THAT APELLES WROUGHT SO SUBTLELY
IT IS BUT WASTE TO BURY THEM PRECIOUSLY
LET HIM FARE WELL GOD GIVE HIS SOULE REST
HE IS NOW IN HIS GRAVE AND IN HIS CHEST
NOW OF MY FIFTHE HUSBAND WILL I TELL
GOD LET HIS SOUL NEVER COME INTO HELL
AND YET WAS HE TO ME THE MOSTE SHREW CRUEL ILL TEMPERED
THAT FEEL I ON MY RIBBES ALL BY REW IN A ROW
AND EVER SHALL UNTIL MINE ENDING DAY
BUT IN OUR BED HE WAS SO FRESH AND GAY
AND THEREWITHAL SO WELL HE COULD ME GLOSE FLATTER
WHEN THAT HE WOULDE HAVE MY BELLE CHOSE
THOUGH HE HAD BEATEN ME ON EVERY BONE
YET COULD HE WIN AGAIN MY LOVE ANON
I TROW I LOV'D HIM BETTER FOR THAT HE
WAS OF HIS LOVE SO DANGEROUS TO ME
SPARING DIFFICULT
WE WOMEN HAVE IF THAT I SHALL NOT LIE
IN THIS MATTER A QUAINTE FANTASY
WHATEVER THING WE MAY NOT LIGHTLY HAVE
THEREAFTER WILL WE CRY ALL DAY AND CRAVE
FORBID US THING AND THAT DESIRE WE
PRESS ON US FAST AND THENNE WILL WE FLEE
WITH DANGER UTTER WE ALL OUR CHAFFARE DIFFICULTY MERCHANDISE
GREAT PRESS AT MARKET MAKETH DEARE WARE
AND TOO GREAT CHEAP IS HELD AT LITTLE PRICE
THIS KNOWETH EVERY WOMAN THAT IS WISE
MY FIFTHE HUSBAND GOD HIS SOULE BLESS
WHICH THAT I TOOK FOR LOVE AND NO RICHESS
HE SOME TIME WAS A CLERK OF OXENFORD A SCHOLAR OF OXFORD
AND HAD LEFT SCHOOL AND WENT AT HOME TO BOARD
WITH MY GOSSIP DWELLING IN OURE TOWN GODMOTHER
GOD HAVE HER SOUL HER NAME WAS ALISOUN
SHE KNEW MY HEART AND ALL MY PRIVITY
BET THAN OUR PARISH PRIEST SO MAY I THE THRIVE
TO HER BETRAYED I MY COUNSEL ALL
FOR HAD MY HUSBAND PISSED ON A WALL
OR DONE A THING THAT SHOULD HAVE COST HIS LIFE
TO HER AND TO ANOTHER WORTHY WIFE
AND TO MY NIECE WHICH THAT I LOVED WELL
I WOULD HAVE TOLD HIS COUNSEL EVERY DEAL JOT
AND SO I DID FULL OFTEN GOD IT WOT
THAT MADE HIS FACE FULL OFTEN RED AND HOT
FOR VERY SHAME AND BLAM'D HIMSELF FOR HE
HAD TOLD TO ME SO GREAT A PRIVITY SECRET
AND SO BEFELL THAT ONES IN A LENT
SO OFTENTIMES I TO MY GOSSIP WENT
FOR EVER YET I LOVED TO BE GAY
AND FOR TO WALK IN MARCH APRIL AND MAY
FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE TO HEARE SUNDRY TALES
THAT JENKIN CLERK AND MY GOSSIP DAME ALES
AND I MYSELF INTO THE FIELDES WENT
MINE HUSBAND WAS AT LONDON ALL THAT LENT
I HAD THE BETTER LEISURE FOR TO PLAY
AND FOR TO SEE AND EKE FOR TO BE SEY SEEN
OF LUSTY FOLK WHAT WIST I WHERE MY GRACE FAVOUR
WAS SHAPEN FOR TO BE OR IN WHAT PLACE APPOINTED
THEREFORE MADE I MY VISITATIONS
TO VIGILIES AND TO PROCESSIONS FESTIVAL EVES 22
TO PREACHINGS EKE AND TO THESE PILGRIMAGES
TO PLAYS OF MIRACLES AND MARRIAGES
AND WEARED UPON ME GAY SCARLET GITES GOWNS
THESE WORMES NOR THESE MOTHES NOR THESE MITES
ON MY APPAREL FRETT THEM NEVER A DEAL FED WHIT
AND KNOW'ST THOU WHY FOR THEY WERE USED WELL
WORN
NOW WILL I TELLE FORTH WHAT HAPPEN'D ME
I SAY THAT IN THE FIELDES WALKED WE
TILL TRUELY WE HAD SUCH DALLIANCE
THIS CLERK AND I THAT OF MY PURVEYANCE FORESIGHT
I SPAKE TO HIM AND TOLD HIM HOW THAT HE
IF I WERE WIDOW SHOULDE WEDDE ME
FOR CERTAINLY I SAY FOR NO BOBANCE BOASTING 23
YET WAS I NEVER WITHOUT PURVEYANCE FORESIGHT
OF MARRIAGE NOR OF OTHER THINGES EKE
I HOLD A MOUSE'S WIT NOT WORTH A LEEK
THAT HATH BUT ONE HOLE FOR TO STARTE TO 24 ESCAPE
AND IF THAT FAILE THEN IS ALL Y DO DONE
I BARE HIM ON HAND HE HAD ENCHANTED ME FALSELY ASSURED HIM
MY DAME TAUGHTE ME THAT SUBTILTY
AND EKE I SAID I METTE OF HIM ALL NIGHT DREAMED
HE WOULD HAVE SLAIN ME AS I LAY UPRIGHT
AND ALL MY BED WAS FULL OF VERY BLOOD
BUT YET I HOP'D THAT HE SHOULD DO ME GOOD
FOR BLOOD BETOKEN'D GOLD AS ME WAS TAUGHT
AND ALL WAS FALSE I DREAM'D OF HIM RIGHT NAUGHT
BUT AS I FOLLOW'D AYE MY DAME'S LORE
AS WELL OF THAT AS OF OTHER THINGS MORE 25
BUT NOW SIR LET ME SEE WHAT SHALL I SAYN
AHA BY GOD I HAVE MY TALE AGAIN
WHEN THAT MY FOURTHE HUSBAND WAS ON BIER
I WEPT ALGATE AND MADE A SORRY CHEER ALWAYS COUNTENANCE
AS WIVES MUST FOR IT IS THE USAGE
AND WITH MY KERCHIEF COVERED MY VISAGE
BUT FOR I WAS PROVIDED WITH A MAKE MATE
I WEPT BUT LITTLE THAT I UNDERTAKE PROMISE
TO CHURCHE WAS MINE HUSBAND BORNE A MORROW
WITH NEIGHEBOURS THAT FOR HIM MADE SORROW
AND JENKIN OURE CLERK WAS ONE OF THO THOSE
AS HELP ME GOD WHEN THAT I SAW HIM GO
AFTER THE BIER METHOUGHT HE HAD A PAIR
OF LEGGES AND OF FEET SO CLEAN AND FAIR
THAT ALL MY HEART I GAVE UNTO HIS HOLD KEEPING
HE WAS I TROW A TWENTY WINTER OLD
AND I WAS FORTY IF I SHALL SAY SOOTH
BUT YET I HAD ALWAYS A COLTE'S TOOTH
GAT TOOTHED I WAS AND THAT BECAME ME WELL SEE NOTE 26
I HAD THE PRINT OF SAINTE VENUS' SEAL
AS HELP ME GOD I WAS A LUSTY ONE
AND FAIR AND RICH AND YOUNG AND WELL BEGONE IN A GOOD WAY
FOR CERTES I AM ALL VENERIAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF VENUS
IN FEELING AND MY HEART IS MARTIAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MARS
VENUS ME GAVE MY LUST AND LIQUORISHNESS
AND MARS GAVE ME MY STURDY HARDINESS 25
MINE ASCENDANT WAS TAURE AND MARS THEREIN TAURUS
ALAS ALAS THAT EVER LOVE WAS SIN
I FOLLOW'D AYE MINE INCLINATION
BY VIRTUE OF MY CONSTELLATION
THAT MADE ME THAT I COULDE NOT WITHDRAW
MY CHAMBER OF VENUS FROM A GOOD FELLAW
YET HAVE I MARTE'S MARK UPON MY FACE
AND ALSO IN ANOTHER PRIVY PLACE
FOR GOD SO WISLY BE MY SALVATION CERTAINLY
I LOVED NEVER BY DISCRETION
BUT EVER FOLLOW'D MINE OWN APPETITE
ALL WERE HE SHORT OR LONG OR BLACK OR WHITE WHETHER
I TOOK NO KEEP SO THAT HE LIKED ME HEED
HOW POOR HE WAS NEITHER OF WHAT DEGREE 25
WHAT SHOULD I SAY BUT THAT AT THE MONTH'S END
THIS JOLLY CLERK JENKIN THAT WAS SO HEND COURTEOUS
HAD WEDDED ME WITH GREAT SOLEMNITY
AND TO HIM GAVE I ALL THE LAND AND FEE
THAT EVER WAS ME GIVEN THEREBEFORE
BUT AFTERWARD REPENTED ME FULL SORE
HE WOULDE SUFFER NOTHING OF MY LIST PLEASURE
BY GOD HE SMOTE ME ONES WITH HIS FIST
FOR THAT I RENT OUT OF HIS BOOK A LEAF
THAT OF THE STROKE MINE EARE WAX'D ALL DEAF
STUBBORN I WAS AS IS A LIONESS
AND OF MY TONGUE A VERY JANGLERESS PRATER
AND WALK I WOULD AS I HAD DONE BEFORN
FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE ALTHOUGH HE HAD IT SWORN HAD SWORN TO
FOR WHICH HE OFTENTIMES WOULDE PREACH PREVENT IT
AND ME OF OLDE ROMAN GESTES TEACH STORIES
HOW THAT SULPITIUS GALLUS LEFT HIS WIFE
AND HER FORSOOK FOR TERM OF ALL HIS
FOR NOUGHT BUT OPEN HEADED HE HER SAY BARE HEADED SAW
LOOKING OUT AT HIS DOOR UPON A DAY
ANOTHER ROMAN 27 TOLD HE ME BY NAME
THAT FOR HIS WIFE WAS AT A SUMMER GAME
WITHOUT HIS KNOWING HE FORSOOK HER EKE
AND THEN WOULD HE UPON HIS BIBLE SEEK
THAT ILKE PROVERB OF ECCLESIAST SAME
WHERE HE COMMANDETH AND FORBIDDETH FAST
MAN SHALL NOT SUFFER HIS WIFE GO ROLL ABOUT
THEN WOULD HE SAY RIGHT THUS WITHOUTE DOUBT
WHOSO THAT BUILDETH HIS HOUSE ALL OF SALLOWS WILLOWS
AND PRICKETH HIS BLIND HORSE OVER THE FALLOWS
AND SUFF'RETH HIS WIFE TO GO SEEKE HALLOWS MAKE PILGRIMAGES
IS WORTHY TO BE HANGED ON THE GALLOWS
BUT ALL FOR NOUGHT I SETTE NOT A HAW CARED NOTHING FOR
OF HIS PROVERBS NOR OF HIS OLDE SAW
NOR WOULD I NOT OF HIM CORRECTED BE
I HATE THEM THAT MY VICES TELLE ME
AND SO DO MORE OF US GOD WOT THAN I
THIS MADE HIM WOOD WITH ME ALL UTTERLY FURIOUS
I WOULDE NOT FORBEAR HIM IN NO CASE
ENDURE
NOW WILL I SAY YOU SOOTH BY SAINT THOMAS
WHY THAT I RENT OUT OF HIS BOOK A LEAF
FOR WHICH HE SMOTE ME SO THAT I WAS DEAF
HE HAD A BOOK THAT GLADLY NIGHT AND DAY
FOR HIS DISPORT HE WOULD IT READ ALWAY
HE CALL'D IT VALERIE 28 AND THEOPHRAST
AND WITH THAT BOOK HE LAUGH'D ALWAY FULL FAST
AND EKE THERE WAS A CLERK SOMETIME AT ROME
A CARDINAL THAT HIGHTE SAINT JEROME
THAT MADE A BOOK AGAINST JOVINIAN
WHICH BOOK WAS THERE AND EKE TERTULLIAN
CHRYSIPPUS TROTULA AND HELOISE
THAT WAS AN ABBESS NOT FAR FROM PARIS
AND EKE THE PARABLES OF SOLOMON PROVERBS
OVIDE'S ART 29 AND BOURDES MANY ONE JESTS
AND ALLE THESE WERE BOUND IN ONE VOLUME
AND EVERY NIGHT AND DAY WAS HIS CUSTUME
WHEN HE HAD LEISURE AND VACATION
FROM OTHER WORLDLY OCCUPATION
TO READEN IN THIS BOOK OF WICKED WIVES
HE KNEW OF THEM MORE LEGENDS AND MORE LIVES
THAN BE OF GOODDE WIVES IN THE BIBLE
FOR TRUST ME WELL IT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE
THAT ANY CLERK WILL SPEAKE GOOD OF WIVES
BUT IF IT BE OF HOLY SAINTES' LIVES UNLESS
NOR OF NONE OTHER WOMAN NEVER THE MO'
WHO PAINTED THE LION TELL IT ME WHO
BY GOD IF WOMEN HADDDE WRITTEN STORIES
AS CLERKES HAVE WITHIN THEIR ORATORIES
THEY WOULD HAVE WRIT OF MEN MORE WICKEDNESS
THAN ALL THE MARK OF ADAM 30 MAY REDRESS
THE CHILDREN OF MERCURY AND OF VENUS 31
BE IN THEIR WORKING FULL CONTRARIOUS
MERCURY LOVETH WISDOM AND SCIENCE
AND VENUS LOVETH RIOT AND DISPENCE EXTRAVAGANCE
AND FOR THEIR DIVERSE DISPOSITION
EACH FALLS IN OTHER'S EXALTATION
AS THUS GOD WOT MERCURY IS DESOLATE
IN PISCES WHERE VENUS IS EXALTATE
AND VENUS FALLS WHERE MERCURY IS RAISED
32
THEREFORE NO WOMAN BY NO CLERK IS PRAISED
THE CLERK WHEN HE IS OLD AND MAY NOT DO
OF VENUS' WORKS NOT WORTH HIS OLDE SHOE
THEN SITS HE DOWN AND WRITES IN HIS DOTAGE
THAT WOMEN CANNOT KEEP THEIR MARRIAGE
BUT NOW TO PURPOSE WHY I TOLDE THEE
THAT I WAS BEATEN FOR A BOOK PARDIE
UPON A NIGHT JENKIN THAT WAS OUR SIRE GOODMAN
READ ON HIS BOOK AS HE SAT BY THE FIRE
OF EVA FIRST THAT FOR HER WICKEDNESS
WAS ALL MANKIND BROUGHT INTO WRETCHEDNESS
FOR WHICH THAT JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF WAS SLAIN
THAT BOUGHT US WITH HIS HEARTE BLOOD AGAIN
LO HERE EXPRESS OF WOMEN MAY YE FIND
THAT WOMAN WAS THE LOSS OF ALL MANKIND
THEN READ HE ME HOW SAMSON LOST HIS HAIRS
SLEEPING HIS LEMAN CUT THEM WITH HER SHEARS
THROUGH WHICHE TREASON LOST HE BOTH HIS EYEN
THEN READ HE ME IF THAT I SHALL NOT LIEN
OF HERCULES AND OF HIS DEJANIRE
THAT CAUSED HIM TO SET HIMSELF ON FIRE
NOTHING FORGOT HE OF THE CARE AND WOE
THAT SOCRATES HAD WITH HIS WIVES TWO
HOW XANTIPPE CAST PISS UPON HIS HEAD
THIS SILLY MAN SAT STILL AS HE WERE DEAD
HE WIP'D HIS HEAD AND NO MORE DURST HE SAYN
BUT ERE THE THUNDER STINT THERE COMETH RAIN CEASES
OF PHASIPHAE THAT WAS QUEEN OF CRETE
FOR SHREWEDNESS HE THOUGHT THE TALE SWEET
WICKEDNESS
FY SPEAK NO MORE IT IS A GRISLY THING
OF HER HORRIBLE LUST AND HER LIKING
OF CLYTEMNESTRA FOR HER LECHERY
THAT FALSELY MADE HER HUSBAND FOR TO DIE
HE READ IT WITH FULL GOOD DEVOTION
HE TOLD ME EKE FOR WHAT OCCASION
AMPHIORAX AT THEBES LOST HIS LIFE
MY HUSBAND HAD A LEGEND OF HIS WIFE
ERYPHILE THAT FOR AN OUCHE OF GOLD CLASP COLLAR
HAD PRIVILY UNTO THE GREEKES TOLD
WHERE THAT HER HUSBAND HID HIM IN A PLACE
FOR WHICH HE HAD AT THEBES SORRY GRACE
OF LUNA TOLD HE ME AND OF LUCIE
THEY BOTHE MADE THEIR HUSBANDS FOR TO DIE
THAT ONE FOR LOVE THAT OTHER WAS FOR HATE
LUNA HER HUSBAND ON AN EV'NING LATE
EMPOISON'D HAD FOR THAT SHE WAS HIS FOE
LUCIA LIQUORISH LOV'D HER HUSBAND SO
THAT FOR HE SHOULD ALWAYS UPON HER THINK
SHE GAVE HIM SUCH A MANNER LOVE DRINK SORT OF
THAT HE WAS DEAD BEFORE IT WERE THE MORROW
AND THUS ALGATES HUSBANDS HADDE SORROW
ALWAYS
THEN TOLD HE ME HOW ONE LATUMEUS
COMPLAINED TO HIS FELLOW ARIUS
THAT IN HIS GARDEN GROWED SUCH A TREE
ON WHICH HE SAID HOW THAT HIS WIVES THREE
HANGED THEMSELVES FOR HEART DISPITEOUS
O LEVE BROTHER QUOTH THIS ARIUS DEAR
GIVE ME A PLANT OF THILKE BLESSED TREE THAT
AND IN MY GARDEN PLANTED SHALL IT BE
OF LATER DATE OF WIVES HATH HE READ
THAT SOME HAVE SLAIN THEIR HUSBANDS IN THEIR BED
AND LET THEIR LECHOUR DIGHT THEM ALL THE NIGHT LOVER RIDE THEM
WHILE THAT THE CORPSE LAY ON THE FLOOR UPRIGHT
AND SOME HAVE DRIVEN NAILS INTO THEIR BRAIN
WHILE THAT THEY SLEPT AND THUS THEY HAVE THEM SLAIN
SOME HAVE THEM GIVEN POISON IN THEIR DRINK
HE SPAKE MORE HARM THAN HEARTE MAY BETHINK
AND THEREWITHAL HE KNEW OF MORE PROVERBS
THAN IN THIS WORLD THERE GROWETH GRASS OR HERBS
BETTER QUOTH HE THINE HABITATION
BE WITH A LION OR A FOUL DRAGON
THAN WITH A WOMAN USING FOR TO CHIDE
BETTER QUOTH HE HIGH IN THE ROOF ABIDE
THAN WITH AN ANGRY WOMAN IN THE HOUSE
THEY BE SO WICKED AND CONTRARIOUS
THEY HATE THAT THEIR HUSBANDS LOVEN AYE
HE SAID A WOMAN CAST HER SHAME AWAY
WHEN SHE CAST OFF HER SMOCK AND FARTHERMO'
A FAIR WOMAN BUT SHE BE CHASTE ALSO EXCEPT
IS LIKE A GOLD RING IN A SOWE'S NOSE
WHO COULDE WEEN OR WHO COULDE SUPPOSE THINK
THE WOE THAT IN MINE HEART WAS AND THE PINE PAIN
AND WHEN I SAW THAT HE WOULD NEVER FINE FINISH
TO READEN ON THIS CURSED BOOK ALL NIGHT

NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE WIFE OF BATH'S TALE
1
AMONG THE EVIDENCES THAT CHAUCER'S GREAT WORK WAS LEFT
INCOMPLETE IS THE ABSENCE OF ANY LINK OF CONNEXION BETWEEN THE
WIFE OF BATH'S PROLOGUE AND TALE AND WHAT GOES BEFORE
THIS
DEFICIENCY HAS IN SOME EDITIONS CAUSED THE SQUIRE'S AND THE
MERCHANT'S TALES TO BE INTERPOSED BETWEEN THOSE OF THE MAN OF
LAW AND THE WIFE OF BATH BUT IN THE MERCHANT'S TALE THERE IS
INTERNAL PROOF THAT IT WAS TOLD AFTER THE JOLLY DAME'S
SEVERAL
MANUSCRIPTS CONTAIN VERSES DESIGNED TO SERVE AS A CONNEXION
BUT THEY ARE EVIDENTLY NOT CHAUCER'S AND IT IS UNNECESSARY TO
GIVE THEM HERE
OF THIS PROLOGUE WHICH MAY FAIRLY BE REGARDED
AS A DISTINCT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL TALE TYRWHITT SAYS THE
EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH OF IT AS WELL AS THE VEIN OF PLEASANTRY THAT
RUNS THROUGH IT IS VERY SUITABLE TO THE CHARACTER OF THE SPEAKER
THE GREATEST PART MUST HAVE BEEN OF CHAUCER'S OWN INVENTION
THOUGH ONE MAY PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD BEEN READING THE POPULAR
INVECTIVES AGAINST MARRIAGE AND WOMEN IN GENERAL SUCH AS THE
'ROMAN DE LA ROSE 'VALERIUS AD RUFINUM DE NON DUCENDA
UXORE 'VALERIUS TO RUFINUS ON NOT BEING RULED BY ONE'S WIFE'
AND PARTICULARLY 'HIERONYMUS CONTRA JOVINIANUM 'JEROME
AGAINST JOVINIANUS' ST JEROME AMONG OTHER THINGS DESIGNED TO
DISCOURAGE MARRIAGE HAS INSERTED IN HIS TREATISE A LONG PASSAGE

THE TALE

IN OLDE DAYES OF THE KING ARTHOUR
OF WHICH THAT BRITONS SPEAKE GREAT HONOUR
ALL WAS THIS LAND FULL FILL'D OF FAERIE FAIRIES
THE ELF QUEEN WITH HER JOLLY COMPANY
DANCED FULL OFT IN MANY A GREEN MEAD
THIS WAS THE OLD OPINION AS I READ
I SPEAK OF MANY HUNDRED YEARS AGO
BUT NOW CAN NO MAN SEE NONE ELVES MO'
FOR NOW THE GREAT CHARITY AND PRAYERES
OF LIMITOURS AND OTHER HOLY FRERES BEGGING FRIARS 2
THAT SEARCH EVERY LAND AND EV'RY STREAM
AS THICK AS MOTES IN THE SUNNE BEAM
BLESSING HALLS CHAMBERS KITCHENES AND BOWERS
CITIES AND BURGHES CASTLES HIGH AND TOWERS
THORPES AND BARNES SHEPENS AND DAIRIES VILLAGES 3 STABLES
THIS MAKES THAT THERE BE NOW NO FAERIES
FOR THERE AS WONT TO WALKE WAS AN ELF WHERE
THERE WALKETH NOW THE LIMITOUR HIMSELF
IN UNDERMELES AND IN MORROWINGS EVENINGS 4 MORNINGS
AND SAITH HIS MATINS AND HIS HOLY THINGS
AS HE GOES IN HIS LIMITATIOUN BEGGING DISTRICT
WOMEN MAY NOW GO SAFELY UP AND DOWN
IN EVERY BUSH AND UNDER EVERY TREE
THERE IS NONE OTHER INCUBUS 5 BUT HE
AND HE WILL DO TO THEM NO DISHONOUR
AND SO BEFELL IT THAT THIS KING ARTHOUR
HAD IN HIS HOUSE A LUSTY BACHELER
THAT ON A DAY CAME RIDING FROM RIVER 6
AND HAPPEN'D THAT ALONE AS SHE WAS BORN
HE SAW A MAIDEN WALKING HIM BEFORN
OF WHICH MAIDEN ANON MAUGRE HER HEAD IN SPITE OF
BY VERY FORCE HE REFT HER MAIDENHEAD
FOR WHICH OPPRESSION WAS SUCH CLAMOUR
AND SUCH PURSUIT UNTO THE KING ARTHOUR
THAT DAMNED WAS THIS KNIGHT FOR TO BE DEAD CONDEMNED
BY COURSE OF LAW AND SHOULD HAVE LOST HIS HEAD
PARAVENTURE SUCH WAS THE STATUTE THO THEN
BUT THAT THE QUEEN AND OTHER LADIES MO'
SO LONG THEY PRAYED THE KING OF HIS GRACE
TILL HE HIS LIFE HIM GRANTED IN THE PLACE
AND GAVE HIM TO THE QUEEN ALL AT HER WILL
TO CHOOSE WHETHER SHE WOULD HIM SAVE OR SPILL DESTROY
THE QUEEN THANKED THE KING WITH ALL HER MIGHT
AND AFTER THIS THUS SPAKE SHE TO THE KNIGHT
WHEN THAT SHE SAW HER TIME UPON A DAY
THOU STANDEST YET QUOTH SHE IN SUCH ARRAY A POSITION
THAT OF THY LIFE YET HAST THOU NO SURETY
I GRANT THEE LIFE IF THOU CANST TELL TO ME
WHAT THING IS IT THAT WOMEN MOST DESIREN
BEWARE AND KEEP THY NECK BONE FROM THE IRON EXECUTIONER'S AXE
AND IF THOU CANST NOT TELL IT ME ANON
YET WILL I GIVE THEE LEAVE FOR TO GON
A TWELVEMONTH AND A DAY TO SEEK AND LEAR LEARN
AN ANSWER SUFFISANT IN THIS MATTERE
SATISFACTORY
AND SURETY WILL I HAVE ERE THAT THOU PACE GO
THY BODY FOR TO YIELDEN IN THIS PLACE
WOE WAS THE KNIGHT AND SORROWFULLY SIKED SIGHED
BUT WHAT HE MIGHT NOT DO ALL AS HIM LIKED
AND AT THE LAST HE CHOSE HIM FOR TO WEND DEPART
AND COME AGAIN RIGHT AT THE YEARE'S END
WITH SUCH ANSWER AS GOD WOULD HIM PURVEY PROVIDE
AND TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENDED FORTH HIS WAY
HE SOUGHT IN EV'RY HOUSE AND EV'RY PLACE
WHERE AS HE HOPED FOR TO FINDE GRACE
TO LEARNE WHAT THING WOMEN LOVE THE MOST
BUT HE COULD NOT ARRIVE IN ANY COAST
WHERE AS HE MIGHTE FIND IN THIS MATTERE
TWO CREATURES ACCORDING IN FERE AGREEING TOGETHER
SOME SAID THAT WOMEN LOVED BEST RICHESS
SOME SAID HONOUR AND SOME SAID JOLLINESS
SOME RICH ARRAY AND SOME SAID LUST A BED PLEASURE
AND OFT TIME TO BE WIDOW AND BE WED
SOME SAID THAT WE ARE IN OUR HEART MOST EASED
WHEN THAT WE ARE Y FLATTER'D AND Y PRAISED
HE WENT FULL NIGH THE SOOTH I WILL NOT LIE CAME VERY NEAR
A MAN SHALL WIN US BEST WITH FLATTERY THE TRUTH
AND WITH ATTENDANCE AND WITH BUSINESS
BE WE Y LIMED BOTHE MORE AND LESS
CAUGHT WITH BIRD LIME
AND SOME MEN SAID THAT WE DO LOVE THE BEST
FOR TO BE FREE AND DO RIGHT AS US LEST WHATEVER WE PLEASE
AND THAT NO MAN REPROVE US OF OUR VICE
BUT SAY THAT WE ARE WISE AND NOTHING NICE FOOLISH 7
FOR TRULY THERE IS NONE AMONG US ALL
IF ANY WIGHT WILL CLAW US ON THE GALL SEE NOTE 8
THAT WILL NOT KICK FOR THAT HE SAITH US SOOTH
ASSAY AND HE SHALL FIND IT THAT SO DO'TH
TRY
FOR BE WE NEVER SO VICIOUS WITHIN
WE WILL BE HELD BOTH WISE AND CLEAN OF SIN
AND SOME MEN SAID THAT GREAT DELIGHT HAVE WE
FOR TO BE HELD STABLE AND EKE SECRE DISCREET
AND IN ONE PURPOSE STEADFASTLY TO DWELL
AND NOT BEWRAY A THING THAT MEN US TELL

BUT THAT TALE IS NOT WORTH A RAKE STELE RAKE HANDLE
PARDIE WE WOMEN CANNE NOTHING HELE HIDE 9
WITNESS ON MIDAS WILL YE HEAR THE TALE
OVID AMONGES OTHER THINGES SMALE SMALL

HE LOV'D HER MOST AND TRUSTED HER ALSO
HE PRAYED HER THAT TO NO CREATURE
SHE WOULDE TELLEN OF HIS DISFIGURE
SHE SWORE HIM NAY FOR ALL THE WORLD TO WIN
SHE WOULD NOT DO THAT VILLAINY OR SIN
TO MAKE HER HUSBAND HAVE SO FOUL A NAME
SHE WOULD NOT TELL IT FOR HER OWEN SHAME
BUT NATHELESS HER THOUGHTE THAT SHE DIED
THAT SHE SO LONGE SHOULD A COUNSEL HIDE
HER THOUGHT IT SWELL'D SO SORE ABOUT HER HEART
THAT NEEDES MUST SOME WORD FROM HER ASTART
AND SINCE SHE DURST NOT TELL IT UNTO MAN
DOWN TO A MARISH FAST THEREBY SHE RAN
TILL SHE CAME THERE HER HEART WAS ALL AFIRE
AND AS A BITTERN BUMBLES IN THE MIRE MAKES A HUMMING NOISE

BUT HOME HE WENT FOR HE MIGHT NOT SOJOURN
THE DAY WAS COME THAT HOMEWARD HE MUST TURN
AND IN HIS WAY IT HAPPEN'D HIM TO RIDE
IN ALL HIS CARE UNDER A FOREST SIDE TROUBLE ANXIETY
WHERE AS HE SAW UPON A DANCE GO

TOWARD THIS ILKE DANCE HE DREW FULL YERN SAME EAGERLY 10
THE HOPE THAT HE SOME WISDOM THERE SHOULD LEARN

THAT AT THE FEAST WAS MADE THAT ILKE DAY
SAME
TO WHICH THING SHORTLY ANSWEREN I SHALL

FOR PRIVILY HE WED HER ON THE MORROW
AND ALL DAY AFTER HID HIM AS AN OWL
SO WOE WAS HIM HIS WIFE LOOK'D SO FOUL
GREAT WAS THE WOE THE KNIGHT HAD IN HIS THOUGHT
WHEN HE WAS WITH HIS WIFE TO BED Y BROUGHT
HE WALLOW'D AND HE TURNED TO AND FRO
THIS OLDE WIFE LAY SMILING EVERMO'

THOU ART SO LOATHLY AND SO OLD ALSO
AND THERETO COMEST OF SO LOW A KIND IN ADDITION
THAT LITTLE WONDER THOUGH I WALLOW AND WIND WRITHE TURN ABOUT

IS THIS QUOTH SHE THE CAUSE OF YOUR UNREST
YEA CERTAINLY QUOTH HE NO WONDER IS
NOW SIR QUOTH SHE I COULD AMEND ALL THIS
IF THAT ME LIST ERE IT WERE DAYES THREE
SO WELL YE MIGHTE BEAR YOU UNTO ME IF YOU COULD CONDUCT
BUT FOR YE SPEAKEN OF SUCH GENTLENESS YOURSELF WELL
AS IS DESCENDED OUT OF OLD RICHESS TOWARDS ME
THAT THEREFORE SHALLE YE BE GENTLEMEN
SUCH ARROGANCY IS NOT WORTH A HEN WORTH NOTHING
LOOK WHO THAT IS MOST VIRTUOUS ALWAY
PRIVE AND APERT AND MOST INTENDETH AYE IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC
TO DO THE GENTLE DEEDES THAT HE CAN
AND TAKE HIM FOR THE GREATEST GENTLEMAN
CHRIST WILL WE CLAIM OF HIM OUR GENTLENESS WILLS REQUIRES
NOT OF OUR ELDERS FOR THEIR OLD RICHESS
ANCESTORS
FOR THOUGH THEY GAVE US ALL THEIR HERITAGE
FOR WHICH WE CLAIM TO BE OF HIGH PARAGE BIRTH DESCENT
YET MAY THEY NOT BEQUEATHE FOR NO THING
TO NONE OF US THEIR VIRTUOUS LIVING
THAT MADE THEM GENTLEMEN CALLED TO BE
AND BADE US FOLLOW THEM IN SUCH DEGREE
WELL CAN THE WISE POET OF FLORENCE
THAT HIGHTE DANTE SPEAK OF THIS SENTENCE SENTIMENT
LO IN SUCH MANNER RHYME IS DANTE'S TALE
KIND OF
'FULL SELD' UPRISETH BY HIS BRANCHES SMALE SELDOM
PROWESS OF MAN FOR GOD OF HIS GOODNESS
WILLS THAT WE CLAIM OF HIM OUR GENTLENESS 12
FOR OF OUR ELDERS MAY WE NOTHING CLAIM
BUT TEMP'RAL THINGS THAT MAN MAY HURT AND MAIM
EKE EVERY WIGHT KNOWS THIS AS WELL AS I
IF GENTLENESS WERE PLANTED NATURALLY
UNTO A CERTAIN LINEAGE DOWN THE LINE
PRIVE AND APERT THEN WOULD THEY NEVER FINE CEASE
TO DO OF GENTLENESS THE FAIR OFFICE
THEN MIGHT THEY DO NO VILLAINY NOR VICE
TAKE FIRE AND BEAR IT TO THE DARKEST HOUSE
BETWIXT THIS AND THE MOUNT OF CAUCASUS
AND LET MEN SHUT THE DOORES AND GO THENNE THENCE
YET WILL THE FIRE AS FAIR AND LIGHTE BRENNE BURN
AS TWENTY THOUSAND MEN MIGHT IT BEHOLD
ITS OFFICE NATURAL AYE WILL IT HOLD IT WILL PERFORM ITS
ON PERIL OF MY LIFE TILL THAT IT DIE
NATURAL DUTY
HERE MAY YE SEE WELL HOW THAT GENTERY GENTILITY NOBILITY
IS NOT ANNEXED TO POSSESSION
SINCE FOLK DO NOT THEIR OPERATION
ALWAY AS DOTH THE FIRE LO IN ITS KIND FROM ITS VERY NATURE
FOR GOD IT WOT MEN MAY FULL OFTEN FIND
A LORDE'S SON DO SHAME AND VILLAINY
AND HE THAT WILL HAVE PRICE OF HIS GENT'RY ESTEEM HONOUR
FOR HE WAS BOREN OF A GENTLE HOUSE BECAUSE
AND HAD HIS ELDERS NOBLE AND VIRTUOUS
AND WILL HIMSELFE DO NO GENTLE DEEDES
NOR FOLLOW HIS GENTLE ANCESTRY THAT DEAD IS
HE IS NOT GENTLE BE HE DUKE OR EARL
FOR VILLAIN SINFUL DEEDES MAKE A CHURL
FOR GENTLENESS IS BUT THE RENOMEE RENOWN
OF THINE ANCESTORS FOR THEIR HIGH BOUNTE GOODNESS WORTH
WHICH IS A STRANGE THING TO THY PERSON
THY GENTLENESS COMETH FROM GOD ALONE
THEN COMES OUR VERY GENTLENESS OF GRACE TRUE
IT WAS NO THING BEQUEATH'D US WITH OUR PLACE
THINK HOW NOBLE AS SAITH VALERIUS

READ IN SENEC AND READ EKE IN BOECE
THERE SHALL YE SEE EXPRESS THAT IT NO DREDE IS DOUBT
THAT HE IS GENTLE THAT DOTH GENTLE DEEDES
AND THEREFORE LEVE HUSBAND I CONCLUDE DEAR
ALBEIT THAT MINE ANCESTORS WERE RUDE
YET MAY THE HIGHE GOD AND SO HOPE I
GRANT ME HIS GRACE TO LIVE VIRTUOUSLY
THEN AM I GENTLE WHEN THAT I BEGIN
TO LIVE VIRTUOUSLY AND WAIVE SIN

AND WHEREAS YE OF POVERT' ME REPREVE REPROACH

GLAD POVERT' IS AN HONEST THING CERTAIN POVERTY CHEERFULLY
THIS WILL SENEC AND OTHER CLERKES SAYN ENDURED
WHOSO THAT HOLDS HIM PAID OF HIS POVERT' IS SATISFIED WITH
I HOLD HIM RICH THOUGH HE HATH NOT A SHIRT
HE THAT COVETETH IS A POORE WIGHT
FOR HE WOULD HAVE WHAT IS NOT IN HIS MIGHT
BUT HE THAT NOUGHT HATH NOR COVETETH TO HAVE
IS RICH ALTHOUGH YE HOLD HIM BUT A KNAVE SLAVE ABJECT WRETCH
VERY POVERT' IS SINNE PROPERLY
THE ONLY TRUE POVERTY IS SIN
JUVENAL SAITH OF POVERT' MERRILY
THE POORE MAN WHEN HE GOES BY THE WAY
BEFORE THE THIEVES HE MAY SING AND PLAY 13
POVERT' IS HATEFUL GOOD 14 AND AS I GUESS
A FULL GREAT BRINGER OUT OF BUSINESS DELIVER FROM TROUBLE
A GREAT AMENDER EKE OF SAPIENCE
TO HIM THAT TAKETH IT IN PATIENCE
POVERT' IS THIS ALTHOUGH IT SEEM ELENGE STRANGE 15
POSSESSION THAT NO WIGHT WILL CHALLENGE
POVERT' FULL OFTEN WHEN A MAN IS LOW
MAKES HIM HIS GOD AND EKE HIMSELF TO KNOW
POVERT' A SPECTACLE IS AS THINKETH ME A PAIR OF SPECTACLES
THROUGH WHICH HE MAY HIS VERY FRIENDES SEE
TRUE
AND THEREFORE SIR SINCE THAT I YOU NOT GRIEVE
OF MY POVERT' NO MORE ME REPREVE REPROACH

ELENGE STRANGE FROM FRENCH ELOIGNER TO REMOVE
THE FRIAR'S TALE
THE PROLOGUE 1
THIS WORTHY LIMITOUR THIS NOBLE FRERE

NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE FRIAR'S TALE
1
ON THE TALE OF THE FRIAR AND THAT OF THE SOMPNOUR WHICH
FOLLOWS TYRWHITT HAS REMARKED THAT THEY ARE WELL ENGRAFTED
UPON THAT OF THE WIFE OF BATH
THE ILL HUMOUR WHICH SHOWS
ITSELF BETWEEN THESE TWO CHARACTERS IS QUITE NATURAL AS NO TWO
PROFESSIONS AT THAT TIME WERE AT MORE CONSTANT VARIANCE
THE
REGULAR CLERGY AND PARTICULARLY THE MENDICANT FRIARS AFFECTED A
TOTAL EXEMPTION FROM ALL ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION EXCEPT THAT
OF THE POPE WHICH MADE THEM EXCEEDINGLY OBNOXIOUS TO THE
BISHOPS AND OF COURSE TO ALL THE INFERIOR OFFICERS OF THE NATIONAL
HIERARCHY BOTH TALES WHATEVER THEIR ORIGIN ARE BITTER SATIRES
ON THE GREED AND WORLDLINESS OF THE ROMISH CLERGY
THE TALE
WHILOM THERE WAS DWELLING IN MY COUNTRY ONCE ON A TIME
AN ARCHDEACON A MAN OF HIGH DEGREE
THAT BOLDELY DID EXECUTION
IN PUNISHING OF FORNICATION
OF WITCHECRAFT AND EKE OF BAWDERY
OF DEFAMATION AND ADULTERY
OF CHURCHE REEVES AND OF TESTAMENTS CHURCHWARDENS
OF CONTRACTS AND OF LACK OF SACRAMENTS
AND EKE OF MANY ANOTHER MANNER CRIME SORT OF
WHICH NEEDETH NOT REHEARSEN AT THIS TIME
OF USURY AND SIMONY ALSO
BUT CERTES LECHOURS DID HE GREATEST WOE
THEY SHOULDE SINGEN IF THAT THEY WERE HENT CAUGHT
AND SMALE TITHERS 1 WERE FOUL Y SHENT TROUBLED PUT TO SHAME
IF ANY PERSON WOULD ON THEM COMPLAIN
THERE MIGHT ASTERT THEM NO PECUNIAL PAIN 2
FOR SMALLE TITHES AND SMALL OFFERING
HE MADE THE PEOPLE PITEOUSLY TO SING
FOR ERE THE BISHOP CAUGHT THEM WITH HIS CROOK
THEY WEREN IN THE ARCHEDEACON'S BOOK
THEN HAD HE THROUGH HIS JURISDICTION
POWER TO DO ON THEM CORRECTION
HE HAD A SOMPNOUR READY TO HIS HAND
A SLIER BOY WAS NONE IN ENGLELAND
FOR SUBTLELY HE HAD HIS ESPIAILLE ESPIONAGE
THAT TAUGHT HIM WELL WHERE IT MIGHT AUGHT AVAIL
HE COULDE SPARE OF LECHOURS ONE OR TWO
TO TEACHE HIM TO FOUR AND TWENTY MO'
FOR THOUGH THIS SOMPNOUR WOOD BE AS A HARE FURIOUS MAD
TO TELL HIS HARLOTRY I WILL NOT SPARE
FOR WE BE OUT OF THEIR CORRECTION
THEY HAVE OF US NO JURISDICTION
NE NEVER SHALL HAVE TERM OF ALL THEIR LIVES
PETER SO BE THE WOMEN OF THE STIVES STEWS
QUOTH THIS SOMPNOUR Y PUT OUT OF OUR CURE CARE
PEACE WITH MISCHANCE AND WITH MISAVENTURE
OUR HOSTE SAID AND LET HIM TELL HIS TALE
NOW TELLE FORTH AND LET THE SOMPNOUR GALE WHISTLE BAWL
NOR SPARE NOT MINE OWEN MASTER DEAR
THIS FALSE THIEF THE SOMPNOUR QUOTH THE FRERE
HAD ALWAYS BAWDES READY TO HIS HAND
AS ANY HAWK TO LURE IN ENGLELAND
THAT TOLD HIM ALL THE SECRETS THAT THEY KNEW
FOR THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WAS NOT COME OF NEW
THEY WERE HIS APPROVERS PRIVILY
INFORMERS
HE TOOK HIMSELF AT GREAT PROFIT THEREBY
HIS MASTER KNEW NOT ALWAYS WHAT HE WAN WON
WITHOUTE MANDEMENT A LEWED MAN IGNORANT
HE COULD SUMMON ON PAIN OF CHRISTE'S CURSE
AND THEY WERE INLY GLAD TO FILL HIS PURSE
AND MAKE HIM GREATE FEASTES AT THE NALE ALEHOUSE
AND RIGHT AS JUDAS HADDE PURSES SMALE SMALL
AND WAS A THIEF RIGHT SUCH A THIEF WAS HE
HIS MASTER HAD BUT HALF HIS DUETY WHAT WAS OWING HIM
HE WAS IF I SHALL GIVE HIM HIS LAUD
A THIEF AND EKE A SOMPNOUR AND A BAWD
AND HE HAD WENCHES AT HIS RETINUE
THAT WHETHER THAT SIR ROBERT OR SIR HUGH
OR JACK OR RALPH OR WHOSO THAT IT WERE
THAT LAY BY THEM THEY TOLD IT IN HIS EAR
THUS WERE THE WENCH AND HE OF ONE ASSENT
AND HE WOULD FETCH A FEIGNED MANDEMENT
AND TO THE CHAPTER SUMMON THEM BOTH TWO
AND PILL THE MAN AND LET THE WENCHE GO
PLUNDER PLUCK
THEN WOULD HE SAY FRIEND I SHALL FOR THY SAKE
DO STRIKE THEE OUT OF OURE LETTERS BLAKE BLACK
THEE THAR NO MORE AS IN THIS CASE TRAVAIL NEED
I AM THY FRIEND WHERE I MAY THEE AVAIL
CERTAIN HE KNEW OF BRIBERS MANY MO'
THAN POSSIBLE IS TO TELL IN YEARE'S TWO
FOR IN THIS WORLD IS NO DOG FOR THE BOW 3
THAT CAN A HURT DEER FROM A WHOLE KNOW
BET THAN THIS SOMPNOUR KNEW A SLY LECHOUR BETTER
OR AN ADULT'RER OR A PARAMOUR
AND FOR THAT WAS THE FRUIT OF ALL HIS RENT
THEREFORE ON IT HE SET ALL HIS INTENT
AND SO BEFELL THAT ONCE UPON A DAY
THIS SOMPNOUR WAITING EVER ON HIS PREY
RODE FORTH TO SUMMON A WIDOW AN OLD RIBIBE 4
FEIGNING A CAUSE FOR HE WOULD HAVE A BRIBE

THANKING HIM OF MY REVELATION
FOR SIR AND DAME TRUSTE ME RIGHT WELL
OUR ORISONS BE MORE EFFECTUEL
AND MORE WE SEE OF CHRISTE'S SECRET THINGS
THAN BOREL FOLK ALTHOUGH THAT THEY BE KINGS
LAYMEN 13
WE LIVE IN POVERT' AND IN ABSTINENCE
AND BOREL FOLK IN RICHES AND DISPENCE
OF MEAT AND DRINK AND IN THEIR FOUL DELIGHT
WE HAVE THIS WORLDE'S LUST ALL IN DESPIGHT PLEASURE CONTEMPT

AND FAT HIS SOUL AND KEEP HIS BODY LEAN

SUFFICE US ALTHOUGH THEY BE NOT FULL GOOD
THE CLEANNESS AND THE FASTING OF US FRERES
MAKETH THAT CHRIST ACCEPTETH OUR PRAYERES
LO MOSES FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHT
FASTED ERE THAT THE HIGH GOD FULL OF MIGHT
SPAKE WITH HIM IN THE MOUNTAIN OF SINAI
WITH EMPTY WOMB OF FASTING MANY A DAY STOMACH
RECEIVED HE THE LAWE THAT WAS WRIT
WITH GODDE'S FINGER AND ELI 14 WELL YE WIT KNOW
IN MOUNT HOREB ERE HE HAD ANY SPEECH
WITH HIGHE GOD THAT IS OUR LIVE'S LEECH PHYSICIAN HEALER
HE FASTED LONG AND WAS IN CONTEMPLANCE
AARON THAT HAD THE TEMPLE IN GOVERNANCE
AND EKE THE OTHER PRIESTES EVERY ONE

BUT THERE IN ABSTINENCE PRAY AND WAKE
LEST THAT THEY DIED TAKE HEED WHAT I SAY
BUT THEY BE SOBER THAT FOR THE PEOPLE PRAY UNLESS
WARE THAT I SAY NO MORE FOR IT SUFFICETH
OUR LORD JESUS AS HOLY WRIT DEVISETH NARRATES

AND SO FORTH ALL THE GOSPEL MAY YE SEE
WHETHER IT BE LIKER OUR PROFESSION
OR THEIRS THAT SWIMMEN IN POSSESSION
FY ON THEIR POMP AND ON THEIR GLUTTONY
AND ON THEIR LEWEDNESS I THEM DEFY
ME THINKETH THEY BE LIKE JOVINIAN 15
FAT AS A WHALE AND WALKING AS A SWAN
ALL VINOLENT AS BOTTLE IN THE SPENCE FULL OF WINE STORE ROOM
THEIR PRAYER IS OF FULL GREAT REVERENCE
WHEN THEY FOR SOULES SAY THE PSALM OF DAVID
LO 'BUF' THEY SAY COR MEUM ERUCTAVIT 16
WHO FOLLOW CHRISTE'S GOSPEL AND HIS LORE DOCTRINE
BUT WE THAT HUMBLE BE AND CHASTE AND PORE POOR

GOD HATH SUCH FAVOUR SENT HER OF HIS GRACE
THAT IT NE SEEMED NOT BY LIKELINESS
THAT SHE WAS BORN AND FED IN RUDENESS
AS IN A COT OR IN AN OX'S STALL
BUT NOURISH'D IN AN EMPERORE'S HALL
TO EVERY WIGHT SHE WAXEN IS SO DEAR GROWN

UNNETHES TROWED THEY BUT DURST HAVE SWORN SCARCELY BELIEVED
THAT TO JANICOL' OF WHOM I SPAKE BEFORE
SHE WAS NOT DAUGHTER FOR BY CONJECTURE
THEM THOUGHT SHE WAS ANOTHER CREATURE
FOR THOUGH THAT EVER VIRTUOUS WAS SHE
SHE WAS INCREASED IN SUCH EXCELLENCE
OF THEWES GOOD Y SET IN HIGH BOUNTE QUALITIES
AND SO DISCREET AND FAIR OF ELOQUENCE
SO BENIGN AND SO DIGNE OF REVERENCE WORTHY
AND COULDE SO THE PEOPLE'S HEART EMBRACE
THAT EACH HER LOV'D THAT LOOKED ON HER FACE
NOT ONLY OF SALUCES IN THE TOWN
PUBLISHED WAS THE BOUNTE OF HER NAME
BUT EKE BESIDES IN MANY A REGIOUN
IF ONE SAID WELL ANOTHER SAID THE SAME
SO SPREAD OF HERE HIGH BOUNTE THE FAME

BUT AS FOR ME I SAY THAT EVIL IT SIT IT ILL BECAME HIM
T'ASSAY A WIFE WHEN THAT IT IS NO NEED

HE SHOULD IT TAKE AND SHEW HER THIS MATTERE
BESEECHING HER TO DO HER BUSINESS
THIS CHILD TO FOSTER IN ALL GENTLENESS
AND WHOSE CHILD IT WAS HE BADE HER HIDE
FROM EVERY WIGHT FOR AUGHT THAT MIGHT BETIDE
THE SERGEANT WENT AND HATH FULFILL'D THIS THING
BUT TO THE MARQUIS NOW RETURNE WE
FOR NOW WENT HE FULL FAST IMAGINING
IF BY HIS WIFE'S CHEER HE MIGHTE SEE
OR BY HER WORDES APPERCEIVE THAT SHE
WERE CHANGED BUT HE NEVER COULD HER FIND
BUT EVER IN ONE ALIKE SAD AND KIND
CONSTANTLY STEADFAST
AS GLAD AS HUMBLE AS BUSY IN SERVICE
AND EKE IN LOVE AS SHE WAS WONT TO BE
WAS SHE TO HIM IN EVERY MANNER WISE SORT OF WAY
AND OF HER DAUGHTER NOT A WORD SPAKE SHE
NO ACCIDENT FOR NO ADVERSITY NO CHANGE OF HUMOUR RESULTING
WAS SEEN IN HER NOR E'ER HER DAUGHTER'S NAME FROM HER AFFLICTION

PARS QUARTA FOURTH PART
IN THIS ESTATE THERE PASSED BE FOUR YEAR
ERE SHE WITH CHILDE WAS BUT AS GOD WO'LD
A KNAVE CHILD SHE BARE BY THIS WALTERE BOY
FULL GRACIOUS AND FAIR FOR TO BEHOLD
AND WHEN THAT FOLK IT TO HIS FATHER TOLD
NOT ONLY HE BUT ALL HIS COUNTRY MERRY
WERE FOR THIS CHILD AND GOD THEY THANK AND HERY PRAISE
WHEN IT WAS TWO YEAR OLD AND FROM THE BREAST
DEPARTED OF THE NORICE ON A DAY TAKEN WEANED
THIS MARQUIS CAUGHTE YET ANOTHER LEST WAS SEIZED BY YET
TO TEMPT HIS WIFE YET FARTHER IF HE MAY
ANOTHER DESIRE
OH NEEDLESS WAS SHE TEMPTED IN AS SAY TRIAL
BUT WEDDED MEN NOT CONNEN NO MEASURE KNOW NO MODERATION
WHEN THAT THEY FIND A PATIENT CREATURE
WIFE QUOTH THE MARQUIS YE HAVE HEARD ERE THIS
MY PEOPLE SICKLY BEAR OUR MARRIAGE REGARD WITH DISPLEASURE
AND NAMELY SINCE MY SON Y BOREN IS ESPECIALLY
NOW IS IT WORSE THAN EVER IN ALL OUR AGE
THE MURMUR SLAYS MINE HEART AND MY CORAGE
FOR TO MINE EARS COMETH THE VOICE SO SMART PAINFULLY
THAT IT WELL NIGH DESTROYED HATH MINE HEART
NOW SAY THEY THUS 'WHEN WALTER IS Y GONE
THEN SHALL THE BLOOD OF JANICOL' SUCCEED
AND BE OUR LORD FOR OTHER HAVE WE NONE
SUCH WORDES SAY MY PEOPLE OUT OF DREDE DOUBT
WELL OUGHT I OF SUCH MURMUR TAKE HEED
FOR CERTAINLY I DREAD ALL SUCH SENTENCE EXPRESSION OF OPINION
THOUGH THEY NOT PLAINEN IN MINE AUDIENCE COMPLAIN IN MY HEARING
I WOULDE LIVE IN PEACE IF THAT I MIGHT
WHEREFORE I AM DISPOSED UTTERLY
AS I HIS SISTER SERVED ERE BY NIGHT BEFORE
RIGHT SO THINK I TO SERVE HIM PRIVILY
THIS WARN I YOU THAT YE NOT SUDDENLY
OUT OF YOURSELF FOR NO WOE SHOULD OUTRAIE BECOME OUTRAGEOUS RAVE
BE PATIENT AND THEREOF I YOU PRAY
I HAVE QUOTH SHE SAID THUS AND EVER SHALL
I WILL NO THING NOR N'ILL NO THING CERTAIN
BUT AS YOU LIST NOT GRIEVETH ME AT ALL
THOUGH THAT MY DAUGHTER AND MY SON BE SLAIN
AT YOUR COMMANDEMENT THAT IS TO SAYN
I HAVE NOT HAD NO PART OF CHILDREN TWAIN
BUT FIRST SICKNESS AND AFTER WOE AND PAIN
YE BE MY LORD DO WITH YOUR OWEN THING
RIGHT AS YOU LIST AND ASK NO REDE OF ME
FOR AS I LEFT AT HOME ALL MY CLOTHING
WHEN I CAME FIRST TO YOU RIGHT SO QUOTH SHE
LEFT I MY WILL AND ALL MY LIBERTY
AND TOOK YOUR CLOTHING WHEREFORE I YOU PRAY
DO YOUR PLEASANCE I WILL YOUR LUST OBEY
WILL
AND CERTES IF I HADDE PRESCIENCE
YOUR WILL TO KNOW ERE YE YOUR LUST ME TOLD WILL
I WOULD IT DO WITHOUTE NEGLIGENCE
BUT NOW I KNOW YOUR LUST AND WHAT YE WO'LD
ALL YOUR PLEASANCE FIRM AND STABLE I HOLD
FOR WIST I THAT MY DEATH MIGHT DO YOU EASE
RIGHT GLADLY WOULD I DIEN YOU TO PLEASE
DEATH MAY NOT MAKE NO COMPARISOUN
UNTO YOUR LOVE AND WHEN THIS MARQUIS SAY SAW
THE CONSTANCE OF HIS WIFE HE CAST ADOWN
HIS EYEN TWO AND WONDER'D HOW SHE MAY
IN PATIENCE SUFFER ALL THIS ARRAY
AND FORTH HE WENT WITH DREARY COUNTENANCE
BUT TO HIS HEART IT WAS FULL GREAT PLEASANCE
THIS UGLY SERGEANT IN THE SAME WISE
THAT HE HER DAUGHTER CAUGHT RIGHT SO HATH HE
OR WORSE IF MEN CAN ANY WORSE DEVISE
Y HENT HER SON THAT FULL WAS OF BEAUTY SEIZED
AND EVER IN ONE SO PATIENT WAS SHE UNVARYINGLY
THAT SHE NO CHEERE MADE OF HEAVINESS
BUT KISS'D HER SON AND AFTER GAN HIM BLESS
SAVE THIS SHE PRAYED HIM IF THAT HE MIGHT
HER LITTLE SON HE WOULD IN EARTHE GRAVE BURY
HIS TENDER LIMBES DELICATE TO SIGHT
FROM FOWLES AND FROM BEASTES FOR TO SAVE
BUT SHE NONE ANSWER OF HIM MIGHTE HAVE
HE WENT HIS WAY AS HIM NOTHING NE RAUGHT CARED
BUT TO BOLOGNA TENDERLY IT BROUGHT
THE MARQUIS WONDER'D EVER LONGER MORE
UPON HER PATIENCE AND IF THAT HE
NOT HADDE SOOTHLY KNOWEN THEREBEFORE
THAT PERFECTLY HER CHILDREN LOVED SHE
HE WOULD HAVE WEEN'D THAT OF SOME SUBTILTY THOUGHT
AND OF MALICE OR FOR CRUEL CORAGE DISPOSITION
SHE HADDE SUFFER'D THIS WITH SAD VISAGE
STEADFAST UNMOVED
BUT WELL HE KNEW THAT NEXT HIMSELF CERTAIN
SHE LOV'D HER CHILDREN BEST IN EVERY WISE
BUT NOW OF WOMEN WOULD I ASKE FAIN
IF THESE ASSAYES MIGHTE NOT SUFFICE
WHAT COULD A STURDY HUSBAND MORE DEVISE STERN
TO PROVE HER WIFEHOOD AND HER STEADFASTNESS
AND HE CONTINUING EV'R IN STURDINESS
BUT THERE BE FOLK OF SUCH CONDITION
THAT WHEN THEY HAVE A CERTAIN PURPOSE TAKE
THIEY CANNOT STINT OF THEIR INTENTION CEASE
BUT RIGHT AS THEY WERE BOUND UNTO A STAKE
THEY WILL NOT OF THEIR FIRSTE PURPOSE SLAKE SLACKEN ABATE
RIGHT SO THIS MARQUIS FULLY HATH PURPOS'D
TO TEMPT HIS WIFE AS HE WAS FIRST DISPOS'D
HE WAITED IF BY WORD OR COUNTENANCE
THAT SHE TO HIM WAS CHANGED OF CORAGE SPIRIT
BUT NEVER COULD HE FINDE VARIANCE
SHE WAS AYE ONE IN HEART AND IN VISAGE
AND AYE THE FARTHER THAT SHE WAS IN AGE
THE MORE TRUE IF THAT IT WERE POSSIBLE
SHE WAS TO HIM IN LOVE AND MORE PENIBLE PAINSTAKING IN DEVOTION
FOR WHICH IT SEEMED THUS THAT OF THEM TWO
THERE WAS BUT ONE WILL FOR AS WALTER LEST PLEASED
THE SAME PLEASANCE WAS HER LUST ALSO PLEASURE
AND GOD BE THANKED ALL FELL FOR THE BEST
SHE SHEWED WELL FOR NO WORLDLY UNREST
A WIFE AS OF HERSELF NO THINGE SHOULD
WILL IN EFFECT BUT AS HER HUSBAUD WOULD
THE SLAND'R OF WALTER WONDROUS WIDE SPRAD
THAT OF A CRUEL HEART HE WICKEDLY
FOR HE A POORE WOMAN WEDDED HAD BECAUSE
HAD MURDER'D BOTH HIS CHILDREN PRIVILY
SUCH MURMUR WAS AMONG THEM COMMONLY
NO WONDER IS FOR TO THE PEOPLE'S EAR
THERE CAME NO WORD BUT THAT THEY MURDER'D WERE
FOR WHICH WHEREAS HIS PEOPLE THEREBEFORE
HAD LOV'D HIM WELL THE SLAND'R OF HIS DIFFAME INFAMY
MADE THEM THAT THEY HIM HATED THEREFORE
TO BE A MURD'RER IS A HATEFUL NAME
BUT NATHELESS FOR EARNEST OR FOR GAME
HE OF HIS CRUEL PURPOSE WOULD NOT STENT
TO TEMPT HIS WIFE WAS SET ALL HIS INTENT
WHEN THAT HIS DAUGHTER TWELVE YEAR WAS OF AGE
HE TO THE COURT OF ROME IN SUBTLE WISE
INFORMED OF HIS WILL SENT HIS MESSAGE MESSENGER
COMMANDING HIM SUCH BULLES TO DEVISE
AS TO HIS CRUEL PURPOSE MAY SUFFICE
HOW THAT THE POPE FOR HIS PEOPLE'S REST
BADE HIM TO WED ANOTHER IF HIM LEST WISHED
I SAY HE BADE THEY SHOULDE COUNTERFEIT
THE POPE'S BULLES MAKING MENTION
THAT HE HAD LEAVE HIS FIRSTE WIFE TO LETE LEAVE
TO STINTE RANCOUR AND DISSENSION PUT AN END TO
BETWIXT HIS PEOPLE AND HIM THUS SPAKE THE BULL
THE WHICH THEY HAVE PUBLISHED AT FULL
THE RUDE PEOPLE AS NO WONDER IS
WEENED FULL WELL THAT IT HAD BEEN RIGHT SO THOUGHT BELIEVED
BUT WHEN THESE TIDINGS CAME TO GRISELDIS
I DEEME THAT HER HEART WAS FULL OF WOE
BUT SHE ALIKE SAD FOR EVERMO' STEADFAST
DISPOSED WAS THIS HUMBLE CREATURE
TH' ADVERSITY OF FORTUNE ALL T' ENDURE
ABIDING EVER HIS LUST AND HIS PLEASANCE
TO WHOM THAT SHE WAS GIVEN HEART AND ALL
AS TO HER VERY WORLDLY SUFFISANCE TO THE UTMOST EXTENT
BUT SHORTLY IF THIS STORY TELL I SHALL OF HER POWER
THE MARQUIS WRITTEN HATH IN SPECIAL
A LETTER IN WHICH HE SHEWED HIS INTENT
AND SECRETLY IT TO BOLOGNA SENT
TO TH' EARL OF PANICO WHICH HADDE THO THERE
WEDDED HIS SISTER PRAY'D HE SPECIALLY
TO BRINGE HOME AGAIN HIS CHILDREN TWO
IN HONOURABLE ESTATE ALL OPENLY
BUT ONE THING HE HIM PRAYED UTTERLY
THAT HE TO NO WIGHT THOUGH MEN WOULD INQUERE
SHOULDE NOT TELL WHOSE CHILDREN THAT THEY WERE
BUT SAY THE MAIDEN SHOULD Y WEDDED BE
UNTO THE MARQUIS OF SALUCE ANON
AND AS THIS EARL WAS PRAYED SO DID HE
FOR AT DAY SET HE ON HIS WAY IS GONE
TOWARD SALUCE AND LORDE'S MANY A ONE
IN RICH ARRAY THIS MAIDEN FOR TO GUIDE
HER YOUNGE BROTHER RIDING HER BESIDE
ARRAYED WAS TOWARD HER MARRIAGE AS IF FOR
THIS FRESHE MAIDEN FULL OF GEMMES CLEAR
HER BROTHER WHICH THAT SEVEN YEAR WAS OF AGE
ARRAYED EKE FULL FRESH IN HIS MANNERE
AND THUS IN GREAT NOBLESS AND WITH GLAD CHEER
TOWARD SALUCES SHAPING THEIR JOURNEY
FROM DAY TO DAY THEY RODE UPON THEIR WAY
PARS QUINTA FIFTH PART
AMONG ALL THIS AFTER HIS WICK' USAGE WHILE ALL THIS WAS

TO THE UTTERMOST PROOF OF HER CORAGE
FULLY TO HAVE EXPERIENCE AND LORE KNOWLEDGE
IF THAT SHE WERE AS STEADFAST AS BEFORE

FULL BOISTEROUSLY SAID HER THIS SENTENCE
CERTES GRISELD' I HAD ENOUGH PLEASANCE
TO HAVE YOU TO MY WIFE FOR YOUR GOODNESS
AND FOR YOUR TRUTH AND FOR YOUR OBEISANCE
NOT FOR YOUR LINEAGE NOR FOR YOUR RICHESS
BUT NOW KNOW I IN VERY SOOTHFASTNESS

UNTO MY FATHER GLADLY WILL I WEND GO
AND WITH HIM DWELL UNTO MY LIFES END
WHERE I WAS FOSTER'D AS A CHILD FULL SMALL
TILL I BE DEAD MY LIFE THERE WILL I LEAD
A WIDOW CLEAN IN BODY HEART AND ALL
FOR SINCE I GAVE TO YOU MY MAIDENHEAD
AND AM YOUR TRUE WIFE IT IS NO DREAD DOUBT
GOD SHIELDE SUCH A LORDES WIFE TO TAKE FORBID

ALL YOUR PLEASANCE WOULD I FOLLOW FAIN CHEERFULLY
BUT YET I HOPE IT BE NOT YOUR INTENT
THAT SMOCKLESS I OUT OF YOUR PALACE WENT

THAT THILKE WOMB IN WHICH YOUR CHILDREN LAY THAT
SHOULDE BEFORE THE PEOPLE IN MY WALKING

NOR IN THIS TIME WORDE SPAKE SHE NONE
HER FATHER THAT THIS TIDING HEARD ANON
CURSED THE DAY AND TIME THAT NATURE
SHOPE HIM TO BE A LIVING CREATURE
FORMED ORDAINED
FOR OUT OF DOUBT THIS OLDE POORE MAN

FOR EVER DEEM'D HE SINCE IT FIRST BEGAN
THAT WHEN THE LORD FULFILL'D HAD HIS CORAGE HAD GRATIFIED HIS WHIM
HE WOULDE THINK IT WERE A DISPARAGE DISPARAGEMENT
TO HIS ESTATE SO LOW FOR TO ALIGHT
AND VOIDE HER AS SOON AS E'ER HE MIGHT
DISMISS
AGAINST HIS DAUGHTER HASTILY WENT HE TO MEET
FOR HE BY NOISE OF FOLK KNEW HER COMING
AND WITH HER OLDE COAT AS IT MIGHT BE
HE COVER'D HER FULL SORROWFULLY WEEPING
BUT ON HER BODY MIGHT HE IT NOT BRING
FOR RUDE WAS THE CLOTH AND MORE OF AGE
BY DAYES FELE THAN AT HER MARRIAGE
MANY 11
THUS WITH HER FATHER FOR A CERTAIN SPACE
DWELLED THIS FLOW'R OF WIFELY PATIENCE
THAT NEITHER BY HER WORDS NOR BY HER FACE
BEFORE THE FOLK NOR EKE IN THEIR ABSENCE
NE SHEWED SHE THAT HER WAS DONE OFFENCE
NOR OF HER HIGH ESTATE NO REMEMBRANCE
NE HADDE SHE AS BY HER COUNTENANCE
TO JUDGE FROM
NO WONDER IS FOR IN HER GREAT ESTATE
HER GHOST WAS EVER IN PLEIN HUMILITY SPIRIT FULL
NO TENDER MOUTH NO HEARTE DELICATE
NO POMP AND NO SEMBLANT OF ROYALTY
BUT FULL OF PATIENT BENIGNITY
DISCREET AND PRIDELESS AYE HONOURABLE
AND TO HER HUSBAND EVER MEEK AND STABLE
MEN SPEAK OF JOB AND MOST FOR HIS HUMBLESS
AS CLERKES WHEN THEM LIST CAN WELL INDITE
NAMELY OF MEN BUT AS IN SOOTHFASTNESS PARTICULARLY

AND AFTER THAT DID FORTH HER BUSINESS
WITH SO GLAD CHEER HIS GUESTES SHE RECEIV'D EXPRESSION
AND SO CONNINGLY EACH IN HIS DEGREE CLEVERLY SKILFULLY

LIVED THESE TWO IN CONCORD AND IN REST
AND RICHELY HIS DAUGHTER MARRIED HE

THIS WORLD IS NOT SO STRONG IT IS NO NAY NOT TO BE DENIED

AND HEARKEN WHAT THIS AUTHOR SAITH THEREFORE
THIS STORY IS SAID 14 NOT FOR THAT WIVES SHOULD

BUT FOR THAT EVERY WIGHT IN HIS DEGREE
SHOULDE BE CONSTANT IN ADVERSITY
AS WAS GRISELDA THEREFORE PETRARCH WRITETH
THIS STORY WHICH WITH HIGH STYLE HE INDITETH
FOR SINCE A WOMAN WAS SO PATIENT
UNTO A MORTAL MAN WELL MORE WE OUGHT
RECEIVEN ALL IN GREE THAT GOD US SENT
GOOD WILL
FOR GREAT SKILL IS HE PROVED THAT HE WROUGHT SEE NOTE 15
BUT HE TEMPTETH NO MAN THAT HE HATH BOUGHT
AS SAITH SAINT JAMES IF YE HIS 'PISTLE READ

THAT IN WHICH HE DIED
THE FACT THAT THE EMBASSY TO GENOA ON
WHICH CHAUCER WAS SENT TOOK PLACE IN 1372 73 HAS LENT
COUNTENANCE TO THE OPINION THAT THE ENGLISH POET DID ACTUALLY
VISIT THE ITALIAN BARD AT PADUA AND HEAR THE STORY FROM HIS OWN

THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST LICENTIOUS CORRUPTIONS OF

NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE MERCHANT'S TALE

THOUGH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MERCHANT TAKES UP THE
CLOSING WORDS OF THE ENVOY TO THE CLERK'S TALE AND REFERS TO
THE PATIENCE OF GRISELDA SEEMS TO PROVE BEYOND DOUBT THAT
THE ORDER OF THE TALES IN THE TEXT IS THE RIGHT ONE YET IN
SOME MANUSCRIPTS OF GOOD AUTHORITY THE FRANKLIN'S TALE
FOLLOWS THE CLERK'S AND THE ENVOY IS CONCLUDED BY THIS
STANZA
THIS WORTHY CLERK WHEN ENDED WAS HIS TALE
OUR HOSTE SAID AND SWORE BY COCKE'S BONES
'ME LEVER WERE THAN A BARREL OF ALE
MY WIFE AT HOME HAD HEARD THIS LEGEND ONCE
THIS IS A GENTLE TALE FOR THE NONCE
AS TO MY PURPOSE WISTE YE MY WILL
BUT THING THAT WILL NOT BE LET IT BE STILL
IN OTHER MANUSCRIPTS OF LESS AUTHORITY THE HOST PROCEEDS IN
TWO SIMILAR STANZAS TO IMPOSE A TALE ON THE FRANKLIN BUT
TYRWHITT IS PROBABLY RIGHT IN SETTING THEM ASIDE AS SPURIOUS
AND IN ADMITTING THE GENUINENESS OF THE FIRST ONLY IF IT BE
SUPPOSED THAT CHAUCER FORGOT TO CANCEL IT WHEN HE HAD
DECIDED ON ANOTHER MODE OF CONNECTING THE MERCHANT'S WITH
THE CLERK'S TALE

SAINT THOMAS OF IND ST
THOMAS THE APOSTLE WHO WAS
BELIEVED TO HAVE TRAVELLED IN INDIA
THE TALE L
WHILOM THERE WAS DWELLING IN LOMBARDY
A WORTHY KNIGHT THAT BORN WAS AT PAVIE
IN WHICH HE LIV'D IN GREAT PROSPERITY
AND FORTY YEARS A WIFELESS MAN WAS HE
AND FOLLOW'D AYE HIS BODILY DELIGHT
ON WOMEN WHERE AS WAS HIS APPETITE
AS DO THESE FOOLES THAT BE SECULERES 2
AND WHEN THAT HE WAS PASSED SIXTY YEARS
WERE IT FOR HOLINESS OR FOR DOTAGE
I CANNOT SAY BUT SUCH A GREAT CORAGE INCLINATION
HADDE THIS KNIGHT TO BE A WEDDED MAN
THAT DAY AND NIGHT HE DID ALL THAT HE CAN
TO ESPY WHERE THAT HE MIGHT WEDDED BE
PRAYING OUR LORD TO GRANTE HIM THAT HE
MIGHTE ONCE KNOWEN OF THAT BLISSFUL LIFE
THAT IS BETWIXT A HUSBAND AND HIS WIFE
AND FOR TO LIVE UNDER THAT HOLY BOND
WITH WHICH GOD FIRSTE MAN AND WOMAN BOND
NONE OTHER LIFE SAID HE IS WORTH A BEAN
FOR WEDLOCK IS SO EASY AND SO CLEAN
THAT IN THIS WORLD IT IS A PARADISE
THUS SAID THIS OLDE KNIGHT THAT WAS SO WISE
AND CERTAINLY AS SOOTH AS GOD IS KING TRUE
TO TAKE A WIFE IT IS A GLORIOUS THING
AND NAMELY WHEN A MAN IS OLD AND HOAR ESPECIALLY
THEN IS A WIFE THE FRUIT OF HIS TREASOR
THEN SHOULD HE TAKE A YOUNG WIFE AND A FAIR
ON WHICH HE MIGHT ENGENDER HIM AN HEIR
AND LEAD HIS LIFE IN JOY AND IN SOLACE MIRTH DELIGHT
WHEREAS THESE BACHELORS SINGEN ALAS
WHEN THAT THEY FIND ANY ADVERSITY
IN LOVE WHICH IS BUT CHILDISH VANITY
AND TRUELY IT SITS WELL TO BE SO BECOMES BEFITS
THAT BACHELORS HAVE OFTEN PAIN AND WOE
ON BRITTLE GROUND THEY BUILD AND BRITTLENESS
THEY FINDE WHEN THEY WEENE SICKERNESS THINK THAT THERE
THEY LIVE BUT AS A BIRD OR AS A BEAST IS SECURITY
IN LIBERTY AND UNDER NO ARREST CHECK CONTROL
WHEREAS A WEDDED MAN IN HIS ESTATE
LIVETH A LIFE BLISSFUL AND ORDINATE
UNDER THE YOKE OF MARRIAGE Y BOUND
WELL MAY HIS HEART IN JOY AND BLISS ABOUND
FOR WHO CAN BE SO BUXOM AS A WIFE OBEDIENT
WHO IS SO TRUE AND EKE SO ATTENTIVE
TO KEEP HIM SICK AND WHOLE AS IS HIS MAKE CARE FOR MATE
FOR WEAL OR WOE SHE WILL HIM NOT FORSAKE
SHE IS NOT WEARY HIM TO LOVE AND SERVE
THOUGH THAT HE LIE BEDRID UNTIL HE STERVE DIE
AND YET SOME CLERKES SAY IT IS NOT SO
OF WHICH HE THEOPHRAST IS ONE OF THO THOSE
WHAT FORCE THOUGH THEOPHRAST LIST FOR TO LIE WHAT MATTER
TAKE NO WIFE QUOTH HE 3 FOR HUSBANDRY THRIFT
AS FOR TO SPARE IN HOUSEHOLD THY DISPENCE
A TRUE SERVANT DOTH MORE DILIGENCE
THY GOOD TO KEEP THAN DOTH THINE OWEN WIFE
FOR SHE WILL CLAIM A HALF PART ALL HER LIFE
AND IF THAT THOU BE SICK SO GOD ME SAVE
THY VERY FRIENDES OR A TRUE KNAVE SERVANT
WILL KEEP THEE BET THAN SHE THAT WAITETH AYE AHWAYS WAITS TO
AFTER THY GOOD AND HATH DONE MANY A DAY INHERIT YOUR PROPERTY
THIS SENTENCE AND A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE
WRITETH THIS MAN THERE GOD HIS BONES CURSE
BUT TAKE NO KEEP OF ALL SUCH VANITY NOTICE
DEFY THEOPHRAST AND HEARKEN TO ME

A WIFE IS GODDE'S GIFTE VERILY
ALL OTHER MANNER GIFTES HARDILY TRULY
AS HANDES RENTES PASTURE OR COMMUNE COMMON LAND
OR MEBLES ALL BE GIFTES OF FORTUNE FURNITURE 4
THAT PASSEN AS A SHADOW ON THE WALL
BUT DREAD THOU NOT IF PLAINLY SPEAK I SHALL DOUBT
A WIFE WILL LAST AND IN THINE HOUSE ENDURE
WELL LONGER THAN THEE LIST PARAVENTURE PERHAPS
MARRIAGE IS A FULL GREAT SACRAMENT
HE WHICH THAT HATH NO WIFE I HOLD HIM SHENT RUINED

AND SAW HIM ALL ALONE BELLY NAKED

LET US NOW MAKE A HELP UNTO THIS MAN
LIKE TO HIMSELF AND THEN HE MADE HIM EVE
HERE MAY YE SEE AND HEREBY MAY YE PREVE PROVE
THAT A WIFE IS MAN S HELP AND HIS COMFORT
HIS PARADISE TERRESTRE AND HIS DISPORT
SO BUXOM AND SO VIRTUOUS IS SHE OBEDIENT COMPLYING
THEY MUSTE NEEDES LIVE IN UNITY
ONE FLESH THEY BE AND ONE BLOOD AS I GUESS
WITH BUT ONE HEART IN WEAL AND IN DISTRESS
A WIFE AH SAINT MARY BEN'DICITE
HOW MIGHT A MAN HAVE ANY ADVERSITY
THAT HATH A WIFE CERTES I CANNOT SAY
THE BLISS THE WHICH THAT IS BETWIXT THEM TWAY
THERE MAY NO TONGUE IT TELL OR HEARTE THINK

UPON HIS BARE KNEES OUGHT ALL HIS LIFE
TO THANK HIS GOD THAT HIM HATH SENT A WIFE
OR ELLES PRAY TO GOD HIM FOR TO SEND
A WIFE TO LAST UNTO HIS LIFE'S END
FOR THEN HIS LIFE IS SET IN SICKERNESS SECURITY
HE MAY NOT BE DECEIVED AS I GUESS
SO THAT HE WORK AFTER HIS WIFE'S REDE COUNSEL
THEN MAY HE BOLDELY BEAR UP HIS HEAD
THEY BE SO TRUE AND THEREWITHAL SO WISE
FOR WHICH IF THOU WILT WORKEN AS THE WISE
DO ALWAY SO AS WOMEN WILL THEE REDE

BY GOOD COUNSEL OF HIS MOTHER REBECC'
BOUNDE THE KIDDES SKIN ABOUT HIS NECK
FOR WHICH HIS FATHER'S BENISON HE WAN
BENEDICTION
LO JUDITH AS THE STORY TELLE CAN
BY GOOD COUNSEL SHE GODDE'S PEOPLE KEPT
AND SLEW HIM HOLOFERNES WHILE HE SLEPT

SAVED HER HUSBAND NABAL WHEN THAT HE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SLAIN
AND LO ESTHER ALSO
BY COUNSEL GOOD DELIVER'D OUT OF WOE
THE PEOPLE OF GOD AND MADE HIM MARDOCHE
OF ASSUERE ENHANCED FOR TO BE
ADVANCED IN DIGNITY
THERE IS NOTHING IN GREE SUPERLATIVE OF HIGHER ESTEEM
AS SAITH SENEC ABOVE A HUMBLE WIFE
SUFFER THY WIFE'S TONGUE AS CATO BIT BID
SHE SHALL COMMAND AND THOU SHALT SUFFER IT
AND YET SHE WILL OBEY OF COURTESY
A WIFE IS KEEPER OF THINE HUSBANDRY

I WARNE THEE IF WISELY THOU WILT WIRCH WORK
LOVE WELL THY WIFE AS CHRIST LOVETH HIS CHURCH

RIGHT AS MEN MAY WARM WAX WITH HANDES PLY BEND MOULD
WHEREFORE I SAY YOU PLAINLY IN A CLAUSE
I WILL NONE OLD WIFE HAVE RIGHT FOR THIS CAUSE
FOR IF SO WERE I HADDE SUCH MISCHANCE
THAT I IN HER COULD HAVE NO PLEASANCE

OF JANUARY ABOUT HIS MARRIAGE
MANY A FAIR SHAPE AND MANY A FAIR VISAGE
THERE PASSED THROUGH HIS HEARTE NIGHT BY NIGHT
AS WHOSO TOOK A MIRROR POLISH'D BRIGHT
AND SET IT IN A COMMON MARKET PLACE
THEN SHOULD HE SEE MANY A FIGURE PACE
BY HIS MIRROR AND IN THE SAME WISE
GAN JANUARY IN HIS THOUGHT DEVISE
OF MAIDENS WHICH THAT DWELTE HIM BESIDE
HE WISTE NOT WHERE THAT HE MIGHT ABIDE STAY FIX HIS CHOICE
FOR IF THAT ONE HAD BEAUTY IN HER FACE
ANOTHER STOOD SO IN THE PEOPLE'S GRACE
FOR HER SADNESS AND HER BENIGNITY SEDATENESS
THAT OF THE PEOPLE GREATEST VOICE HAD SHE
AND SOME WERE RICH AND HAD A BADDE NAME
BUT NATHELESS BETWIXT EARNEST AND GAME

AND LET ALL OTHERS FROM HIS HEARTE GON
AND CHOSE HER OF HIS OWN AUTHORITY
FOR LOVE IS BLIND ALL DAY AND MAY NOT SEE

HER MIDDLE SMALL HER ARMES LONG AND SLENDER
HER WISE GOVERNANCE HER GENTLENESS
HER WOMANLY BEARING AND HER SADNESS SEDATENESS
AND WHEN THAT HE ON HER WAS CONDESCENDED HAD SELECTED HER

THAT NONE OF THEM NO ARGUMENTS WOULD MAKE A FAVOUR OF THEM

AND VERY GROUND OF HIS PROSPERITY
HE SAID THERE WAS A MAIDEN IN THE TOWN
WHICH THAT OF BEAUTY HADDE GREAT RENOWN
ALL WERE IT SO SHE WERE OF SMALL DEGREE ALTHOUGH
SUFFICED HIM HER YOUTH AND HER BEAUTY
WHICH MAID HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO HIS WIFE
TO LEAD IN EASE AND HOLINESS HIS LIFE
AND THANKED GOD THAT HE MIGHT HAVE HER ALL
THAT NO WIGHT WITH HIS BLISSE PARTE SHALL HAVE A SHARE
AND PRAYED THEM TO LABOUR IN THIS NEED

THAT EV'R I AM AGHAST NOW IN MINE AGE ASHAMED AFRAID
THAT I SHALL HEAD NOW SO MERRY A LIFE
SO DELICATE WITHOUTE WOE OR STRIFE

AND CERTAINLY I DARE RIGHT WELL SAY THIS
HYMENEUS THAT GOD OF WEDDING IS
SAW NEVER HIS LIFE SO MERRY A WEDDED MAN
HOLD THOU THY PEACE THOU POET MARCIAN 10
THAT WRITEST US THAT ILKE WEDDING MERRY SAME
OF HER PHILOLOGY AND HIM MERCURY
AND OF THE SONGES THAT THE MUSES SUNG
TOO SMALL IS BOTH THY PEN AND EKE THY TONGUE
FOR TO DESCRIBEN OF THIS MARRIAGE
WHEN TENDER YOUTH HATH WEDDED STOOPING AGE
THERE IS SUCH MIRTH THAT IT MAY NOT BE WRIT
ASSAY IT YOURESELF THEN MAY YE WIT KNOW
IF THAT I LIE OR NO IN THIS MATTERE
MAIUS THAT SAT WITH SO BENIGN A CHEER COUNTENANCE
HER TO BEHOLD IT SEEMED FAERIE
QUEEN ESTHER NEVER LOOK'D WITH SUCH AN EYE
ON ASSUERE SO MEEK A LOOK HAD SHE
I MAY YOU NOT DEVISE ALL HER BEAUTY
BUT THUS MUCH OF HER BEAUTY TELL I MAY
THAT SHE WAS HIKE THE BRIGHT MORROW OF MAY
FULL FILLED OF ALL BEAUTY AND PLEASANCE
THIS JANUARY IS RAVISH'D IN A TRANCE
AT EVERY TIME HE LOOKED IN HER FACE
BUT IN HIS HEART HE GAN HER TO MENACE
THAT HE THAT NIGHT IN ARMES WOULD HER STRAIN
HARDER THAN EVER PARIS DID HELENE
BUT NATHELESS YET HAD HE GREAT PITY
THAT THILKE NIGHT OFFENDE HER MUST HE
AND THOUGHT ALAS O TENDER CREATURE
NOW WOULDE GOD YE MIGHTE WELL ENDURE
ALL MY COURAGE IT IS SO SHARP AND KEEN
I AM AGHAST YE SHALL IT NOT SUSTENE
AFRAID
BUT GOD FORBID THAT I DID ALL MY MIGHT
NOW WOULDE GOD THAT IT WERE WAXEN NIGHT
AND THAT THE NIGHT WOULD LASTEN EVERMO'
I WOULD THAT ALL THIS PEOPLE WERE Y GO GONE AWAY
AND FINALLY HE DID ALL HIS LABOUR
AS HE BEST MIGHTE SAVING HIS HONOUR
TO HASTE THEM FROM THE MEAT IN SUBTLE WISE
THE TIME CAME THAT REASON WAS TO RISE
AND AFTER THAT MEN DANCE AND DRINKE FAST
AND SPICES ALL ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY CAST
AND FULL OF JOY AND BLISS IS EVERY MAN
ALL BUT A SQUIRE THAT HIGHTE DAMIAN
WHO CARV'D BEFORE THE KNIGHT FULL MANY A DAY
HE WAS SO RAVISH'D ON HIS LADY MAY
THAT FOR THE VERY PAIN HE WAS NIGH WOOD MAD
ALMOST HE SWELT AND SWOONED WHERE HE STOOD FAINTED
SO SORE HAD VENUS HURT HIM WITH HER BRAND
AS THAT SHE BARE IT DANCING IN HER HAND
AND TO HIS BED HE WENT HIM HASTILY
NO MORE OF HIM AS AT THIS TIME SPEAK I
BUT THERE I LET HIM WEEP ENOUGH AND PLAIN BEWAIL
TILL FRESHE MAY WILL RUE UPON HIS PAIN
O PERILOUS FIRE THAT IN THE BEDSTRAW BREEDETH
O FOE FAMILIAR THAT HIS SERVICE BEDETH DOMESTIC 11 OFFERS
O SERVANT TRAITOR O FALSE HOMELY HEWE SERVANT 12
LIKE TO THE ADDER IN BOSOM SHY UNTRUE
GOD SHIELD US ALLE FROM YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
O JANUARY DRUNKEN IN PLEASANCE
OF MARRIAGE SEE HOW THY DAMIAN
THINE OWEN SQUIER AND THY BOREN MAN BORN 13
INTENDETH FOR TO DO THEE VILLAINY DISHONOUR OUTRAGE
GOD GRANTE THEE THINE HOMEHY FOE T' ESPY
ENEMY IN THE HOUSEHOLD
FOR IN THIS WORLD IS NO WORSE PESTILENCE
THAN HOMELY FOE ALL DAY IN THY PRESENCE
PERFORMED HATH THE SUN HIS ARC DIURN DAILY
NO LONGER MAY THE BODY OF HIM SOJOURN
ON THE HORIZON IN THAT LATITUDE
NIGHT WITH HIS MANTLE THAT IS DARK AND RUDE
GAN OVERSPREAD THE HEMISPHERE ABOUT
FOR WHICH DEPARTED IS THIS LUSTY ROUT PLEASANT COMPANY
FROM JANUARY WITH THANK ON EVERY SIDE
HOME TO THEIR HOUSES LUSTILY THEY RIDE
WHERE AS THEY DO THEIR THINGES AS THEM LEST
AND WHEN THEY SEE THEIR TIME THEY GO TO REST
SOON AFTER THAT THIS HASTY JANUARY EAGER
WILL GO TO BED HE WILL NO LONGER TARRY
HE DRANKE HIPPOCRAS CLARRE AND VERNAGE 14
OF SPICES HOT TO INCREASE HIS COURAGE
AND MANY A LECTUARY HAD HE FULL FINE POTION
SUCH AS THE CURSED MONK DAN CONSTANTINE 15
HATH WRITTEN IN HIS BOOK DE COITU OF SEXUAL INTERCOURSE
TO EAT THEM ALL HE WOULD NOTHING ESCHEW
AND TO HIS PRIVY FRIENDES THUS SAID HE
FOR GODDE'S LOVE AS SOON AS IT MAY BE
LET VOIDEN ALL THIS HOUSE IN COURTEOUS WISE EVERYONE LEAVE
AND THEY HAVE DONE RIGHT AS HE WILL DEVISE
MEN DRINKEN AND THE TRAVERS DRAW ANON CURTAINS
THE BRIDE IS BROUGHT TO BED AS STILL AS STONE
AND WHEN THE BED WAS WITH THE PRIEST Y BLESS'D
OUT OF THE CHAMBER EVERY WIGHT HIM DRESS'D
AND JANUARY HATH FAST IN ARMS Y TAKE
HIS FRESHE MAY HIS PARADISE HIS MAKE MATE
HE LULLED HER HE KISSED HER FULL OFT
WITH THICKE BRISTLES OF HIS BEARD UNSOFT
LIKE TO THE SKIN OF HOUNDFISH SHARP AS BRERE DOGFISH BRIAR
FOR HE WAS SHAV'N ALL NEW IN HIS MANNERE
HE RUBBED HER UPON HER TENDER FACE
AND SAIDE THUS ALAS I MUST TRESPACE
TO YOU MY SPOUSE AND YOU GREATLY OFFEND
ERE TIME COME THAT I WILL DOWN DESCEND
BUT NATHELESS CONSIDER THIS QUOTH HE
THERE IS NO WORKMAN WHATSOE'ER HE BE
THAT MAY BOTH WORKE WELL AND HASTILY
THIS WILL BE DONE AT LEISURE PERFECTLY
IT IS NO FORCE HOW LONGE THAT WE PLAY NO MATTER
IN TRUE WEDLOCK COUPLED BE WE TWAY
AND BLESSED BE THE YOKE THAT WE BE IN
FOR IN OUR ACTES MAY THERE BE NO SIN
A MAN MAY DO NO SINNE WITH HIS WIFE
NOR HURT HIMSELFE WITH HIS OWEN KNIFE
FOR WE HAVE LEAVE TO PLAY US BY THE LAW
THUS LABOUR'D HE TILL THAT THE DAY GAN DAW
AND THEN HE TOOK A SOP IN FINE CLARRE
AND UPRIGHT IN HIS BEDDE THEN SAT HE
AND AFTER THAT HE SANG FULL LOUD AND CLEAR
AND KISS'D HIS WIFE AND MADE WANTON CHEER
HE WAS ALL COLTISH FULL OF RAGERIE WANTONNESS
AND FULL OF JARGON AS A FLECKED PIE 16
THE SLACKE SKIN ABOUT HIS NECKE SHAKED
WHILE THAT HE SANG SO CHANTED HE AND CRAKED QUAVERED
BUT GOD WOT WHAT THAT MAY THOUGHT IN HER HEART
WHEN SHE HIM SAW UP SITTING IN HIS SHIRT
IN HIS NIGHT CAP AND WITH HIS NECKE LEAN
SHE PRAISED NOT HIS PLAYING WORTH A BEAN
THEN SAID HE THUS MY RESTE WILL I TAKE
NOW DAY IS COME I MAY NO LONGER WAKE
AND DOWN HE LAID HIS HEAD AND SLEPT TILL PRIME
AND AFTERWARD WHEN THAT HE SAW HIS TIME
UP ROSE JANUARY BUT FRESHE MAY
HELDE HER CHAMBER TILL THE FOURTHE DAY
AS USAGE IS OF WIVES FOR THE BEST
FOR EVERY LABOUR SOME TIME MUST HAVE REST
OR ELLES LONGE MAY HE NOT ENDURE
THIS IS TO SAY NO LIFE OF CREATURE
BE IT OF FISH OR BIRD OR BEAST OR MAN
NOW WILL I SPEAK OF WOEFUL DAMIAN
THAT LANGUISHETH FOR LOVE AS YE SHALL HEAR
THEREFORE I SPEAK TO HIM IN THIS MANNEARE

GOD BE THINE HELP I CAN NO BETTER SAY
THIS SICKE DAMIAN IN VENUS' FIRE
SO BURNED THAT HE DIED FOR DESIRE
FOR WHICH HE PUT HIS LIFE IN AVENTURE AT RISK
NO LONGER MIGHT HE IN THIS WISE ENDURE
BUT PRIVILY A PENNER GAN HE BORROW WRITING CASE
AND IN A LETTER WROTE HE ALL HIS SORROW
IN MANNER OF A COMPLAINT OR A LAY
UNTO HIS FAIRE FRESHE LADY MAY
AND IN A PURSE OF SILK HUNG ON HIS SHIRT
HE HATH IT PUT AND LAID IT AT HIS HEART
THE MOONE THAT AT NOON WAS THILKE DAY THAT
THAT JANUARY HAD WEDDED FRESHE MAY
IN TEN OF TAURE WAS INTO CANCER GLIDED 17
SO LONG HAD MAIUS IN HER CHAMBER ABIDED
AS CUSTOM IS UNTO THESE NOBLES ALL
A BRIDE SHALL NOT EATEN IN THE BALL
TILL DAYES FOUR OR THREE DAYS AT THE LEAST
Y PASSED BE THEN LET HER GO TO FEAST
THE FOURTHE DAY COMPLETE FROM NOON TO NOON
WHEN THAT THE HIGHE MASSE WAS Y DONE
IN HALLE SAT THIS JANUARY AND MAY
AS FRESH AS IS THE BRIGHTE SUMMER'S DAY
AND SO BEFELL HOW THAT THIS GOODE MAN
REMEMBER'D HIM UPON THIS DAMIAN
AND SAIDE SAINT MARY HOW MAY THIS BE
THAT DAMIAN ATTENDETH NOT TO ME
IS HE AYE SICK OR HOW MAY THIS BETIDE
HIS SQUIERS WHICH THAT STOODE THERE BESIDE
EXCUSED HIM BECAUSE OF HIS SICKNESS
WHICH LETTED HIM TO DO HIS BUSINESS HINDERED
NONE OTHER CAUSE MIGHTE MAKE HIM TARRY
THAT ME FORTHINKETH QUOTH THIS JANUARY GRIEVES CAUSES
HE IS A GENTLE SQUIER BY MY TRUTH UNEASINESS
IF THAT HE DIED IT WERE GREAT HARM AND RUTH

TILL THAT YE SLEEPE FASTE BY MY SIDE
AND WITH THAT WORD HE GAN UNTO HIM CALL
A SQUIER THAT WAS MARSHAL OF HIS HALL
AND TOLD HIM CERTAIN THINGES THAT HE WO'LD

WITH ALL HER WOMEN UNTO DAMIAN
DOWN BY HIS BEDDES SIDE SAT SHE THAN THEN
COMFORTING HIM AS GOODLY AS SHE MAY
THIS DAMIAN WHEN THAT HIS TIME HE SAY SAW

IN WHICH THAT HE Y WRITTEN HAD HIS WILL
HATH PUT INTO HER HAND WITHOUTE MORE
SAVE THAT HE SIGHED WONDROUS DEEP AND SORE
AND SOFTELY TO HER RIGHT THUS SAID HE

HE TOOK HER AND HE KISSED HER FULL OFT
AND LAID HIM DOWN TO SLEEP AND THAT ANON
SHE FEIGNED HER AS THAT SHE MUSTE GON
THERE AS YE KNOW THAT EVERY WIGHT MUST NEED
AND WHEN SHE OF THIS BILL HAD TAKEN HEED
SHE RENT IT ALL TO CLOUTES AT THE LAST FRAGMENTS
AND IN THE PRIVY SOFTELY IT CAST
WHO STUDIETH NOW BUT FAIRE FRESHE MAY IS THOUGHTFUL
ADOWN BY OLDE JANUARY SHE LAY
THAT SLEPTE TILL THE COUGH HAD HIM AWAKED
ANON HE PRAY'D HER STRIPPE HER ALL NAKED
HE WOULD OF HER HE SAID HAVE SOME PLEASANCE
AND SAID HER CLOTHES DID HIM INCUMBRANCE
AND SHE OBEY'D HIM BE HER LEFE OR LOTH WILLING OR UNWILLING
BUT LEST THAT PRECIOUS FOLK BE WITH ME WROTH OVER NICE 19
HOW THAT HE WROUGHT I DARE NOT TO YOU TELL
OR WHETHER SHE THOUGHT IT PARADISE OR HELL
BUT THERE I LET THEM WORKEN IN THEIR WISE
TILL EVENSONG RING AND THEY MUST ARISE
WERE IT BY DESTINY OR AVENTURE CHANCE
WERE IT BY INFLUENCE OR BY NATURE
OR CONSTELLATION THAT IN SUCH ESTATE
THE HEAVEN STOOD AT THAT TIME FORTUNATE
AS FOR TO PUT A BILL OF VENUS' WORKS
FOR ALLE THING HATH TIME AS SAY THESE CLERKS
TO ANY WOMAN FOR TO GET HER LOVE
I CANNOT SAY BUT GREATE GOD ABOVE
THAT KNOWETH THAT NONE ACT IS CAUSELESS
HE DEEM OF ALL FOR I WILL HOLD MY PEACE
LET HIM JUDGE
BUT SOOTH IS THIS HOW THAT THIS FRESHE MAY
HATH TAKEN SUCH IMPRESSION THAT DAY
OF PITY ON THIS SICKE DAMIAN
THAT FROM HER HEARTE SHE NOT DRIVE CAN
THE REMEMBRANCE FOR TO DO HIM EASE TO SATISFY
CERTAIN THOUGHT SHE WHOM THAT THIS THING DISPLEASE HIS DESIRE
I RECKE NOT FOR HERE I HIM ASSURE
TO LOVE HIM BEST OF ANY CREATURE
THOUGH HE NO MORE HADDEE THAN HIS SHIRT
LO PITY RUNNETH SOON IN GENTLE HEART
HERE MAY YE SEE HOW EXCELLENT FRANCHISE GENEROSITY
IN WOMEN IS WHEN THEY THEM NARROW ADVISE CLOSELY CONSIDER
SOME TYRANT IS AS THERE BE MANY A ONE
THAT HATH A HEART AS HARD AS ANY STONE
WHICH WOULD HAVE LET HIM STERVEN IN THE PLACE DIE
WELL RATHER THAN HAVE GRANTED HIM HER GRACE
AND THEN REJOICEN IN HER CRUEL PRIDE
AND RECKON NOT TO BE A HOMICIDE
THIS GENTLE MAY FULL FILLED OF PITY
RIGHT OF HER HAND A LETTER MAKED SHE
IN WHICH SHE GRANTED HIM HER VERY GRACE
THERE LACKED NOUGHT BUT ONLY DAY AND PLACE
WHERE THAT SHE MIGHT UNTO HIS LUST SUFFICE
FOR IT SHALL BE RIGHT AS HE WILL DEVISE
AND WHEN SHE SAW HER TIME UPON A DAY
TO VISIT THIS DAMIAN WENT THIS MAY
AND SUBTILLY THIS LETTER DOWN SHE THRUST
UNDER HIS PILLOW READ IT IF HIM LUST PLEASED
SHE TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND HARD HIM TWIST
SO SECRETLY THAT NO WIGHT OF IT WIST
AND BADE HIM BE ALL WHOLE AND FORTH SHE WENT
TO JANUARY WHEN HE FOR HER SENT
UP ROSE DAMIAN THE NEXTE MORROW
ALL PASSED WAS HIS SICKNESS AND HIS SORROW
HE COMBED HIM HE PROINED 20 HIM AND PICKED
HE DID ALL THAT UNTO HIS LADY LIKED
AND EKE TO JANUARY HE WENT AS LOW
AS EVER DID A DOGGE FOR THE BOW 21
HE IS SO PLEASANT UNTO EVERY MAN
FOR CRAFT IS ALL WHOSO THAT DO IT CAN
EVERY WIGHT IS FAIN TO SPEAK HIM GOOD
AND FULLY IN HIS LADY'S GRACE HE STOOD
THUS LEAVE I DAMIAN ABOUT HIS NEED
AND IN MY TALE FORTH I WILL PROCEED
SOME CLERKE HOLDE THAT FELICITY WRITERS SCHOLARS

TO HIS DEGREE WAS MAKED AS A KING'S
AMONGES OTHER OF HIS HONEST THINGS
HE HAD A GARDEN WALLED ALL WITH STONE
SO FAIR A GARDEN WOT I NOWHERE NONE
FOR OUT OF DOUBT I VERILY SUPPOSE
THAT HE THAT WROTE THE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE 22
COULD NOT OF IT THE BEAUTY WELL DEVISE DESCRIBE
NOR PRIAPUS 23 MIGHTE NOT WELL SUFFICE
THOUGH HE BE GOD OF GARDENS FOR TO TELL
THE BEAUTY OF THE GARDEN AND THE WELL FOUNTAIN

DISPORTED THEM AND MADE MELODY
ABOUT THAT WELL AND DANCED AS MEN TOLD
THIS NOBLE KNIGHT THIS JANUARY OLD
SUCH DAINTY HAD IN IT TO WALK AND PLAY PLEASURE
THAT HE WOULD SUFFER NO WIGHT TO BEAR THE KEY
SAVE HE HIMSELF FOR OF THE SMALL WICKET

WITH WHICH WHEN THAT HIM LIST HE IT UNSHET OPENED
AND WHEN THAT HE WOULD PAY HIS WIFE'S DEBT
IN SUMMER SEASON THITHER WOULD HE GO
AND MAY HIS WIFE AND NO WIGHT BUT THEY TWO
AND THINGES WHICH THAT WERE NOT DONE IN BED

AND IN THIS WISE MANY A MERRY DAY

THE TREASON WHICH THAT WOMAN DOTH TO MAN

I PRAY YOU TAKE THE SENTENCE OF THE MAN OPINION REAL MEANING
HE MEANT THUS THAT IN SOVEREIGN BOUNTE PERFECT GOODNESS
IS NONE BUT GOD NO NEITHER HE NOR SHE MAN NOR WOMAN
HEY FOR THE VERY GOD THAT IS BUT ONE
WHY MAKE YE SO MUCH OF SOLOMON
WHAT THOUGH HE MADE A TEMPLE GODDE'S HOUSE
WHAT THOUGH HE WERE RICH AND GLORIOUS
SO MADE HE EKE A TEMPLE OF FALSE GODDES
HOW MIGHT HE DO A THING THAT MORE FORBODE IS FORBIDDEN
PARDIE AS FAIR AS YE HIS NAME EMPLASTER PLASTER OVER WHITEWASH
HE WAS A LECHOUR AND AN IDOLASTER IDOHATER
AND IN HIS ELD HE VERY GOD FORSOOK
THE TRUE

NOTES TO THE MERCHANT'S TALE
1
IF AS IS PROBABLE THIS TALE WAS TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH
THE ORIGINAL IS NOT NOW EXTANT
TYRWHITT REMARKS THAT THE SCENE
IS LAID IN ITALY BUT NONE OF THE NAMES EXCEPT DAMIAN AND
JUSTIN SEEM TO BE ITALIAN BUT RATHER MADE AT PLEASURE SO THAT I
DOUBT WHETHER THE STORY BE REALLY OF ITALIAN GROWTH
THE
ADVENTURE OF THE PEAR TREE I FIND IN A SMALL COLLECTION OF LATIN
FABLES WRITTEN BY ONE ADOIPHUS IN ELEGIAC VERSES OF HIS FASHION
IN THE YEAR 1315
WHATEVER WAS THE REAL ORIGIN OF THE TALE
THE MACHINERY OF THE FAIRIES WHICH CHAUCER HAS USED SO HAPPILY
WAS PROBABLY ADDED BY HIMSELF AND INDEED I CANNOT HELP
THINKING THAT HIS PLUTO AND PROSERPINA WERE THE TRUE PROGENITORS
OF OBERON AND TITANIA OR RATHER THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAVE
ONCE AT LEAST DEIGNED TO REVISIT OUR POETICAL SYSTEM UNDER THE
LATTER NAMES
2
SECULERES OF THE LAITY BUT PERHAPS SINCE THE WORD IS OF TWO
FOLD MEANING CHAUCER INTENDS A HIT AT THE SECULAR CLERGY WHO
UNLIKE THE REGULAR ORDERS DID NOT LIVE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD
BUT SHARED IN ALL ITS INTERESTS AND PLEASURES ALL THE MORE EASILY
AND FREELY THAT THEY HAD NOT THE CIVIL RESTRAINT OF MARRIAGE

THIS AND THE NEXT EIGHT LINES ARE TAKEN FROM THE LIBER

WADE'S BOAT WAS CALLED GUINGELOT AND IN IT ACCORDING TO
THE OLD ROMANCE THE OWNER UNDERWENT A LONG SERIES OF WILD

UNCERTAIN BUT MR WRIGHT SEEMS TO BE WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING
THAT WADE'S ADVENTURES WERE CITED AS EXAMPLES OF CRAFT AND
CUNNING THAT THE HERO IN FACT WAS A KIND OF NORTHERN
ULYSSES IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TO THE SAME SOURCE WE MAY TRACE THE
PROVERBIAL PHRASE FOUND IN CHAUCER'S REMEDY OF LOVE TO

THE TALE 1
PARS PRIMA FIRST PART
AT SARRA IN THE LAND OF TARTARY
THERE DWELT A KING THAT WARRAYED RUSSIE 2 MADE WAR ON
THROUGH WHICH THERE DIED MANY A DOUGHTY MAN
THIS NOBLE KING WAS CALLED CAMBUSCAN 3
WHICH IN HIS TIME WAS OF SO GREAT RENOWN
THAT THERE WAS NOWHERE IN NO REGIOUN
SO EXCELLENT A LORD IN ALLE THING
HIM LACKED NOUGHT THAT LONGETH TO A KING
AS OF THE SECT OF WHICH THAT HE WAS BORN
HE KEPT HIS LAW TO WHICH HE WAS Y SWORN
AND THERETO HE WAS HARDY WISE AND RICH MOREOVER BESIDES
AND PITEOUS AND JUST ALWAYS Y LICH ALIKE EVEN TEMPERED
TRUE OF HIS WORD BENIGN AND HONOURABLE
OF HIS CORAGE AS ANY CENTRE STABLE FIRM IMMOVABLE OF SPIRIT
YOUNG FRESH AND STRONG IN ARMES DESIROUS
AS ANY BACHELOR OF ALL HIS HOUSE
A FAIR PERSON HE WAS AND FORTUNATE
AND KEPT ALWAY SO WELL HIS ROYAL ESTATE
THAT THERE WAS NOWHERE SUCH ANOTHER MAN
THIS NOBLE KING THIS TARTAR CAMBUSCAN
HADDE TWO SONS BY ELFETA HIS WIFE
OF WHICH THE ELDEST HIGHTE ALGARSIFE
THE OTHER WAS Y CALLED CAMBALLO
A DAUGHTER HAD THIS WORTHY KING ALSO
THAT YOUNGEST WAS AND HIGHTE CANACE
BUT FOR TO TELLE YOU ALL HER BEAUTY
IT LIES NOT IN MY TONGUE NOR MY CONNING SKILL
I DARE NOT UNDERTAKE SO HIGH A THING
MINE ENGLISH EKE IS INSUFFICIENT
IT MUSTE BE A RHETOR EXCELLENT ORATOR
THAT COUTH HIS COLOURS LONGING FOR THAT ART SEE 4
IF HE SHOULD HER DESCRIBEN ANY PART
I AM NONE SUCH I MUST SPEAK AS I CAN
AND SO BEFELL THAT WHEN THIS CAMBUSCAN
HAD TWENTY WINTERS BORNE HIS DIADEM
AS HE WAS WONT FROM YEAR TO YEAR I DEEM
HE LET THE FEAST OF HIS NATIVITY HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY
DO CRYE THROUGHOUT SARRA HIS CITY BE PROCLAIMED
THE LAST IDUS OF MARCH AFTER THE YEAR
PHOEBUS THE SUN FULL JOLLY WAS AND CLEAR
FOR HE WAS NIGH HIS EXALTATION
IN MARTE'S FACE AND IN HIS MANSION 5
IN ARIES THE CHOLERIC HOT SIGN
FULL LUSTY WAS THE WEATHER AND BENIGN PLEASANT
FOR WHICH THE FOWLS AGAINST THE SUNNE SHEEN BRIGHT
WHAT FOR THE SEASON AND THE YOUNGE GREEN
FULL LOUDE SANGE THEIR AFFECTIONS
THEM SEEMED TO HAVE GOT PROTECTIONS
AGAINST THE SWORD OF WINTER KEEN AND COLD
THIS CAMBUSCAN OF WHICH I HAVE YOU TOLD
IN ROYAL VESTURE SAT UPON HIS DAIS
WITH DIADEM FULL HIGH IN HIS PALACE
AND HELD HIS FEAST SO SOLEMN AND SO RICH
THAT IN THIS WORLDE WAS THERE NONE IT LICH LIKE
OF WHICH IF I SHOULD TELL ALL THE ARRAY
THEN WOULD IT OCCUPY A SUMMER'S DAY
AND EKE IT NEEDETH NOT FOR TO DEVISE DESCRIBE
AT EVERY COURSE THE ORDER OF SERVICE
I WILL NOT TELLEN OF THEIR STRANGE SEWES DISHES 6
NOR OF THEIR SWANNES NOR THEIR HERONSEWS YOUNG HERONS 7
EKE IN THAT LAND AS TELLE KNIGHTES OLD
THERE IS SOME MEAT THAT IS FULL DAINTY HOLD
THAT IN THIS LAND MEN RECK OF IT FULL SMALL CARE FOR
THERE IS NO MAN THAT MAY REPORTEN ALL
I WILL NOT TARRY YOU FOR IT IS PRIME
AND FOR IT IS NO FRUIT BUT LOSS OF TIME
UNTO MY PURPOSE I WILL HAVE RECOURSE
STORY 8
AND SO BEFELL THAT AFTER THE THIRD COURSE
WHILE THAT THIS KING SAT THUS IN HIS NOBLEY NOBLE ARRAY
HEARING HIS MINISTRELES THEIR THINGES PLAY
BEFORE HIM AT HIS BOARD DELICIOUSLY
IN AT THE HALLE DOOR ALL SUDDENLY
THERE CAME A KNIGHT UPON A STEED OF BRASS
AND IN HIS HAND A BROAD MIRROR OF GLASS
UPON HIS THUMB HE HAD OF GOLD A RING
AND BY HIS SIDE A NAKED SWORD HANGING
AND UP HE RODE UNTO THE HIGHE BOARD
IN ALL THE HALL WAS THERE NOT SPOKE A WORD
FOR MARVEL OF THIS KNIGHT HIM TO BEHOLD
FULL BUSILY THEY WAITED YOUNG AND OLD
WATCHED
THIS STRANGE KNIGHT THAT CAME THUS SUDDENLY
ALL ARMED SAVE HIS HEAD FULL RICHELY
SALUTED KING AND QUEEN AND LORDES ALL
BY ORDER AS THEY SATTEN IN THE HALL
WITH SO HIGH REVERENCE AND OBSERVANCE
AS WELL IN SPEECH AS IN HIS COUNTENANCE
THAT GAWAIN 9 WITH HIS OLDE COURTESY
THOUGH HE WERE COME AGAIN OUT OF FAERIE
HIM COULDE NOT AMENDE WITH A WORD COULD NOT BETTER HIM
AND AFTER THIS BEFORE THE HIGHE BOARD BY ONE WORD
HE WITH A MANLY VOICE SAID HIS MESSAGE
AFTER THE FORM USED IN HIS LANGUAGE
WITHOUTE VICE OF SYLLABLE OR LETTER
FAULT
AND FOR HIS TALE SHOULDE SEEM THE BETTER
ACCORDANT TO HIS WORDE'S WAS HIS CHEER DEMEANOUR
AS TEACHETH ART OF SPEECH THEM THAT IT LEAR LEARN
ALBEIT THAT I CANNOT SOUND HIS STYLE
NOR CANNOT CLIMB OVER SO HIGH A STILE
YET SAY I THIS AS TO COMMUNE INTENT GENERAL SENSE OR MEANING
THUS MUCH AMOUNTETH ALL THAT EVER HE MEANT THIS IS THE SUM OF
IF IT SO BE THAT I HAVE IT IN MIND
HE SAID THE KING OF ARABY AND IND
MY LIEGE LORD ON THIS SOLEMNE DAY
SALUTETH YOU AS HE BEST CAN AND MAY
AND SENDETH YOU IN HONOUR OF YOUR FEAST
BY ME THAT AM ALL READY AT YOUR HEST COMMAND
THIS STEED OF BRASS THAT EASILY AND WELL
CAN IN THE SPACE OF ONE DAY NATUREL
THIS IS TO SAY IN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS
WHERESO YOU LIST IN DROUGHT OR ELSE IN SHOW'RS
BEARE YOUR BODY INTO EVERY PLACE
TO WHICH YOUR HEARTE WILLETH FOR TO PACE PASS GO
WITHOUTE WEM OF YOU THROUGH FOUL OR FAIR
HURT INJURY
OR IF YOU LIST TO FLY AS HIGH IN AIR
AS DOTH AN EAGLE WHEN HIM LIST TO SOAR
THIS SAME STEED SHALL BEAR YOU EVERMORE
WITHOUTE HARM TILL YE BE WHERE YOU LEST IT PLEASES YOU
THOUGH THAT YE SLEEPEN ON HIS BACK OR REST
AND TURN AGAIN WITH WRITHING OF A PIN
TWISTING
HE THAT IT WROUGHT HE COUDE MANY A GIN KNEW CONTRIVANCE 10
HE WAITED IN ANY A CONSTELLATION OBSERVED
ERE HE HAD DONE THIS OPERATION
AND KNEW FULL MANY A SEAL 11 AND MANY A BOND
THIS MIRROR EKE THAT I HAVE IN MINE HOND
HATH SUCH A MIGHT THAT MEN MAY IN IT SEE
WHEN THERE SHALL FALL ANY ADVERSITY
UNTO YOUR REALM OR TO YOURSELF ALSO
AND OPENLY WHO IS YOUR FRIEND OR FOE
AND OVER ALL THIS IF ANY LADY BRIGHT
HATH SET HER HEART ON ANY MANNER WIGHT
IF HE BE FALSE SHE SHALL HIS TREASON SEE
HIS NEWE LOVE AND ALL HIS SUBTLETY
SO OPENLY THAT THERE SHALL NOTHING HIDE
WHEREFORE AGAINST THIS LUSTY SUMMER TIDE
THIS MIRROR AND THIS RING THAT YE MAY SEE
HE HATH SENT TO MY LADY CANACE
YOUR EXCELLENTE DAUGHTER THAT IS HERE
THE VIRTUE OF THIS RING IF YE WILL HEAR
IS THIS THAT IF HER LIST IT FOR TO WEAR
UPON HER THUMB OR IN HER PURSE IT BEAR
THERE IS NO FOWL THAT FLYETH UNDER HEAVEN
THAT SHE SHALL NOT WELL UNDERSTAND HIS STEVEN SPEECH SOUND
AND KNOW HIS MEANING OPENLY AND PLAIN
AND ANSWER HIM IN HIS LANGUAGE AGAIN
AND EVERY GRASS THAT GROWETH UPON ROOT
SHE SHALL EKE KNOW TO WHOM IT WILL DO BOOT REMEDY
ALL BE HIS WOUNDES NE'ER SO DEEP AND WIDE
THIS NAKED SWORD THAT HANGETH BY MY SIDE
SUCH VIRTUE HATH THAT WHAT MAN THAT IT SMITE
THROUGHOUT HIS ARMOUR IT WILL CARVE AND BITE
WERE IT AS THICK AS IS A BRANCHED OAK
AND WHAT MAN IS Y WOUNDED WITH THE STROKE
SHALL NE'ER BE WHOLE TILL THAT YOU LIST OF GRACE
TO STROKE HIM WITH THE FLAT IN THILKE PLACE THE SAME
WHERE HE IS HURT THIS IS AS MUCH TO SAYN
YE MUSTE WITH THE FLATTE SWORD AGAIN
STROKE HIM UPON THE WOUND AND IT WILL CLOSE
THIS IS THE VERY SOOTH WITHOUTE GLOSE DECEIT
IT FAILETH NOT WHILE IT IS IN YOUR HOLD
AND WHEN THIS KNIGHT HAD THUS HIS TALE TOLD
HE RODE OUT OF THE HALL AND DOWN HE LIGHT
HIS STEEDE WHICH THAT SHONE AS SUNNE BRIGHT
STOOD IN THE COURT AS STILL AS ANY STONE
THE KNIGHT IS TO HIS CHAMBER LED ANON
AND IS UNARMED AND TO MEAT Y SET SEATED
THESE PRESENTS BE FULL RICHELY Y FET FETCHED
THIS IS TO SAY THE SWORD AND THE MIRROUR
AND BORNE ANON INTO THE HIGHE TOW'R
WITH CERTAIN OFFICERS ORDAIN'D THEREFOR
AND UNTO CANACE THE RING IS BORE
SOLEMNELY WHERE SHE SAT AT THE TABLE
BUT SICKERLY WITHOUTEN ANY FABLE
THE HORSE OF BRASS THAT MAY NOT BE REMUED REMOVED 12
IT STOOD AS IT WERE TO THE GROUND Y GLUED
THERE MAY NO MAN OUT OF THE PLACE IT DRIVE
FOR NO ENGINE OF WINDLASS OR POLIVE PULLEY
AND CAUSE WHY FOR THEY CAN NOT THE CRAFT KNOW NOT THE CUNNING
AND THEREFORE IN THE PLACE THEY HAVE IT LAFT OF THE MECHANISM
TILL THAT THE KNIGHT HATH TAUGHT THEM THE MANNERE
TO VOIDE HIM AS YE SHALL AFTER HEAR
REMOVE
GREAT WAS THE PRESS THAT SWARMED TO AND FRO
TO GAUREN ON THIS HORSE THAT STOODE SO GAZE
FOR IT SO HIGH WAS AND SO BROAD AND LONG
SO WELL PROPORTIONED FOR TO BE STRONG
RIGHT AS IT WERE A STEED OF LOMBARDY
THEREWITH SO HORSELY AND SO QUICK OF EYE
AS IT A GENTLE POILEIS 13 COURSER WERE
FOR CERTES FROM HIS TAIL UNTO HIS EAR
NATURE NOR ART NE COULD HIM NOT AMEND
IN NO DEGREE AS ALL THE PEOPLE WEND WEENED THOUGHT
BUT EVERMORE THEIR MOSTE WONDER WAS
HOW THAT IT COULDE GO AND WAS OF BRASS
IT WAS OF FAERIE AS THE PEOPLE SEEM'D
DIVERSE FOLK DIVERSELY THEY DEEM'D
AS MANY HEADS AS MANY WITTES BEEN
THEY MURMURED AS DOTH A SWARM OF BEEN BEES
AND MADE SKILLS AFTER THEIR FANTASIES REASONS
REHEARSING OF THE OLDE POETRIES
AND SAID THAT IT WAS LIKE THE PEGASEE PEGASUS
THE HORSE THAT HADDE WINGES FOR TO FLEE FLY
OR ELSE IT WAS THE GREEKE'S HORSE SINON 14
THAT BROUGHTE TROYE TO DESTRUCTION
AS MEN MAY IN THE OLDE GESTES READ
TALES OF ADVENTURES
MINE HEART QUOTH ONE IS EVERMORE IN DREAD
I TROW SOME MEN OF ARMES BE THEREIN
THAT SHAPE THEM THIS CITY FOR TO WIN DESIGN PREPARE
IT WERE RIGHT GOOD THAT ALL SUCH THING WERE KNOW
ANOTHER ROWNED TO HIS FELLOW LOW WHISPERED
AND SAID HE LIES FOR IT IS RATHER LIKE
AN APPARENCE MADE BY SOME MAGIC
AS JUGGLERS PLAYEN AT THESE FEASTES GREAT
OF SUNDRY DOUBTS THEY JANGLE THUS AND TREAT
AS LEWED PEOPLE DEEME COMMONLY IGNORANT
OF THINGES THAT BE MADE MORE SUBTILLY
THAN THEY CAN IN THEIR LEWDNESS COMPREHEND
THEY DEEME GLADLY TO THE BADDER END ARE READY TO THINK
AND SOME OF THEM WONDER'D ON THE MIRROUR THE WORST
THAT BORNE WAS UP INTO THE MASTER TOW'R CHIEF 15
HOW MEN MIGHT IN IT SUCHE THINGES SEE
ANOTHER ANSWER'D AND SAID IT MIGHT WELL BE
NATURALLY BY COMPOSITIONS
OF ANGLES AND OF SLY REFLECTIONS
AND SAIDE THAT IN ROME WAS SUCH A ONE
THEY SPEAK OF ALHAZEN AND VITELLON 16
AND ARISTOTLE THAT WROTE IN THEIR LIVES
OF QUAINTE MIRRORS AND OF PROSPECTIVES CURIOUS
AS KNOWE THEY THAT HAVE THEIR BOOKES HEARD
AND OTHER FOLK HAVE WONDER'D ON THE SWERD SWORD
THAT WOULDE PIERCE THROUGHOUT EVERY THING
AND FELL IN SPEECH OF TELEPHUS THE KING
AND OF ACHILLES FOR HIS QUAINTE SPEAR 17
FOR HE COULD WITH IT BOTHE HEAL AND DERE WOUND
RIGHT IN SUCH WISE AS MEN MAY WITH THE SWERD
OF WHICH RIGHT NOW YE HAVE YOURSELVES HEARD
THEY SPAKE OF SUNDRY HARD'NING OF METAL
AND SPAKE OF MEDICINES THEREWITHAL
AND HOW AND WHEN IT SHOULDE HARDEN'D BE
WHICH IS UNKNOWEN ALGATE UNTO ME
HOWEVER
THEN SPAKE THEY OF CANACEE'S RING
AND SAIDEN ALL THAT SUCH A WONDROUS THING
OF CRAFT OF RINGS HEARD THEY NEVER NONE
SAVE THAT HE MOSES AND KING SOLOMON
HADDEN A NAME OF CONNING IN SUCH ART
A REPUTATION FOR
THUS SAID THE PEOPLE AND DREW THEM APART
KNOWLEDGE
PUT NATHELESS SOME SAIDE THAT IT WAS
WONDER TO MAKEN OF FERN ASHES GLASS
AND YET IS GLASS NOUGHT LIKE ASHES OF FERN
BUT FOR THEY HAVE Y KNOWEN IT SO FERNE BECAUSE BEFORE 18
THEREFORE CEASETH THEIR JANGLING AND THEIR WONDER
AS SORE WONDER SOME ON CAUSE OF THUNDER
ON EBB AND FLOOD ON GOSSAMER AND MIST
AND ON ALL THINGS TILL THAT THE CAUSE IS WIST KNOWN
THUS JANGLE THEY AND DEEMEN AND DEVISE
TILL THAT THE KING GAN FROM HIS BOARD ARISE
PHOEBUS HAD LEFT THE ANGLE MERIDIONAL
AND YET ASCENDING WAS THE BEAST ROYAL
THE GENTLE LION WITH HIS ALDRIAN 19
WHEN THAT THIS TARTAR KING THIS CAMBUSCAN
ROSE FROM THE BOARD THERE AS HE SAT FULL HIGH
BEFORE HIM WENT THE LOUDE MINSTRELSY
TILL HE CAME TO HIS CHAMBER OF PAREMENTS 20
THERE AS THEY SOUNDED DIVERSE INSTRUMENTS
THAT IT WAS LIKE A HEAVEN FOR TO HEAR
NOW DANCED LUSTY VENUS' CHILDREN DEAR
FOR IN THE FISH THEIR LADY SAT FULL PISCES
AND LOOKED ON THEM WITH A FRIENDLY EYE
21
THIS NOBLE KING IS SET UPON HIS THRONE
THIS STRANGE KNIGHT IS FETCHED TO HIM FULL SONE SOON
AND ON THE DANCE HE GOES WITH CANACE
HERE IS THE REVEL AND THE JOLLITY
THAT IS NOT ABLE A DULL MAN TO DEVISE DESCRIBE
HE MUST HAVE KNOWEN LOVE AND HIS SERVICE
AND BEEN A FEASTLY MAN AS FRESH AS MAY MERRY GAY
THAT SHOULDE YOU DEVISE SUCH ARRAY
WHO COULDE TELLE YOU THE FORM OF DANCES
SO UNCOUTH AND SO FRESHE COUNTENANCES UNFAMLIAR GESTURES
SUCH SUBTLE LOOKINGS AND DISSIMULANCES
FOR DREAD OF JEALOUS MEN'S APPERCEIVINGS
NO MAN BUT LAUNCELOT 22 AND HE IS DEAD
THEREFORE I PASS O'ER ALL THIS LUSTIHEAD PLEASANTNESS
I SAY NO MORE BUT IN THIS JOLLINESS
I LEAVE THEM TILL TO SUPPER MEN THEM DRESS
THE STEWARD BIDS THE SPICES FOR TO HIE HASTE
AND EKE THE WINE IN ALL THIS MELODY
THE USHERS AND THE SQUIERS BE Y GONE
THE SPICES AND THE WINE IS COME ANON
THEY EAT AND DRINK AND WHEN THIS HATH AN END
UNTO THE TEMPLE AS REASON WAS THEY WEND
THE SERVICE DONE THEY SUPPEN ALL BY DAY
WHAT NEEDETH YOU REHEARSE THEIR ARRAY
EACH MAN WOT WELL THAT AT A KINGE'S FEAST
IS PLENTY TO THE MOST AND TO THE LEAST HIGHEST
AND DAINTIES MORE THAN BE IN MY KNOWING
AT AFTER SUPPER WENT THIS NOBLE KING
TO SEE THE HORSE OF BRASS WITH ALL A ROUT
OF LORDES AND OF LADIES HIM ABOUT
SUCH WOND'RING WAS THERE ON THIS HORSE OF BRASS
THAT SINCE THE GREAT SIEGE OF TROYE WAS
THERE AS MEN WONDER'D ON A HORSE ALSO
NE'ER WAS THERE SUCH A WOND'RING AS WAS THO THERE
BUT FINALLY THE KING ASKED THE KNIGHT
THE VIRTUE OF THIS COURSER AND THE MIGHT
AND PRAYED HIM TO TELL HIS GOVERNANCE MODE OF MANAGING HIM
THE HORSE ANON BEGAN TO TRIP AND DANCE
WHEN THAT THE KNIGHT LAID HAND UPON HIS REIN
AND SAIDE SIR THERE IS NO MORE TO SAYN
BUT WHEN YOU LIST TO RIDEN ANYWHERE
YE MUSTE TRILL A PIN STANDS IN HIS EAR TURN 23
WHICH I SHALL TELLE YOU BETWIXT US TWO
YE MUSTE NAME HIM TO WHAT PLACE ALSO
OR TO WHAT COUNTRY THAT YOU LIST TO RIDE
AND WHEN YE COME WHERE YOU LIST ABIDE
BID HIM DESCEND AND TRILL ANOTHER PIN
FOR THEREIN LIES TH' EFFECT OF ALL THE GIN CONTRIVANCE 10
AND HE WILL DOWN DESCEND AND DO YOUR WILL
AND IN THAT PLACE HE WILL ABIDE STILL
THOUGH ALL THE WORLD HAD THE CONTRARY SWORE
HE SHALL NOT THENCE BE THROWEN NOR BE BORE
OR IF YOU LIST TO BID HIM THENNES GON
TRILL THIS PIN AND HE WILL VANISH ANON
OUT OF THE SIGHT OF EVERY MANNER WIGHT
AND COME AGAIN BE IT BY DAY OR NIGHT
WHEN THAT YOU LIST TO CLEPE HIM AGAIN CALL
IN SUCH A GUISE AS I SHALL TO YOU SAYN
BETWIXTE YOU AND ME AND THAT FULL SOON

CHERISH THE BLOOD NATURE'S FRIEND QUOTH HE
THEY THANKED HIM GAPING BY TWO AND THREE
AND EVERY WIGHT GAN DRAW HIM TO HIS REST
AS SLEEP THEM BADE THEY TOOK IT FOR THE BEST
THEIR DREAMES SHALL NOT NOW BE TOLD FOR ME

THAT CAUSED DREAMS OF WHICH THERE IS NO CHARGE OF NO SIGNIFICANCE
THEY SLEPTE TILL THAT IT WAS PRIME LARGE LATE MORNING
THE MOSTE PART BUT IT WAS CANACE EXCEPT
SHE WAS FULL MEASURABLE AS WOMEN BE MODERATE
FOR OF HER FATHER HAD SHE TA'EN HER LEAVE
TO GO TO REST SOON AFTER IT WAS EVE
HER LISTE NOT APPALLED FOR TO BE TO LOOK PALE
NOR ON THE MORROW UNFEASTLY FOR TO SEE TO LOOK SAD DEPRESSED
AND SLEPT HER FIRSTE SLEEP AND THEN AWOKE
FOR SUCH A JOY SHE IN HER HEARTE TOOK
BOTH OF HER QUAINTE A RING AND HER MIRROUR
THAT TWENTY TIMES SHE CHANGED HER COLOUR
AND IN HER SLEEP RIGHT FOR TH' IMPRESSION
OF HER MIRROR SHE HAD A VISION
WHEREFORE ERE THAT THE SUNNE GAN UP GLIDE
SHE CALL'D UPON HER MISTRESS' HER BESIDE GOVERNESSES
AND SAIDE THAT HER LISTE FOR TO RISE
THESE OLDE WOMEN THAT BE GLADLY WISE
AS ARE HER MISTRESSES ANSWER'D ANON
AND SAID MADAME WHITHER WILL YE GON
THUS EARLY FOR THE FOLK BE ALL IN REST
I WILL QUOTH SHE ARISE FOR ME LEST
NO LONGER FOR TO SLEEP AND WALK ABOUT
HER MISTRESSES CALL'D WOMEN A GREAT ROUT
AND UP THEY ROSE WELL A TEN OR TWELVE
UP ROSE FRESHE CANACE HERSELVE
AS RUDDY AND BRIGHT AS IS THE YONNGE SUN
THAT IN THE RAM IS FOUR DEGREES Y RUN
NO HIGHER WAS HE WHEN SHE READY WAS
AND FORTH SHE WALKED EASILY A PACE
ARRAY'D AFTER THE LUSTY SEASON SWOOT PLEASANT SWEET
LIGHTELY FOR TO PLAY AND WALK ON FOOT
NOUGHT BUT WITH FIVE OR SIX OF HER MEINIE
AND IN A TRENCH FORTH IN THE PARK WENT SHE
SUNKEN PATH
THE VAPOUR WHICH UP FROM THE EARTHE GLODE GLIDED
MADE THE SUN TO SEEM RUDDY AND BROAD
BUT NATHELESS IT WAS SO FAIR A SIGHT
THAT IT MADE ALL THEIR HEARTES FOR TO LIGHT BE LIGHTENED GLAD
WHAT FOR THE SEASON AND THE MORROWNING
AND FOR THE FOWLES THAT SHE HEARDE SING
FOR RIGHT ANON SHE WISTE WHAT THEY MEANT KNEW
RIGHT BY THEIR SONG AND KNEW ALL THEIR INTENT
THE KNOTTE WHY THAT EVERY TALE IS TOLD NUCLEUS CHIEF MATTER
IF IT BE TARRIED TILL THE LIST BE COLD DELAYED INCLINATION
OF THEM THAT HAVE IT HEARKEN'D AFTER YORE FOR A LONG TIME
THE SAVOUR PASSETH EVER LONGER MORE
FOR FULSOMNESS OF THE PROLIXITY
AND BY THAT SAME REASON THINKETH ME
I SHOULDE UNTO THE KNOTTE CONDESCEND
AND MAKEN OF HER WALKING SOON AN END
AMID A TREE FORDRY AS WHITE AS CHALK THOROUGHLY DRIED UP
THERE SAT A FALCON O'ER HER HEAD FULL HIGH
THAT WITH A PITEOUS VOICE SO GAN TO CRY
THAT ALL THE WOOD RESOUNDED OF HER CRY
AND BEAT SHE HAD HERSELF SO PITEOUSLY
WITH BOTH HER WINGES TILL THE REDDE BLOOD
RAN ENDELONG THE TREE THERE AS SHE STOOD FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
AND EVER IN ONE ALWAY SHE CRIED AND SHRIGHT INCESSANTLY SHRIEKED
AND WITH HER BEAK HERSELFE SHE SO PIGHT WOUNDED
THAT THERE IS NO TIGER NOR CRUEL BEAST
THAT DWELLETH EITHER IN WOOD OR IN FOREST
BUT WOULD HAVE WEPT IF THAT HE WEEPE COULD
FOR SORROW OF HER SHE SHRIEK'D ALWAY SO LOUD
FOR THERE WAS NEVER YET NO MAN ALIVE
IF THAT HE COULD A FALCON WELL DESCRIVE DESCRIBE
THAT HEARD OF SUCH ANOTHER OF FAIRNESS
AS WELL OF PLUMAGE AS OF GENTLENESS
OF SHAPE OF ALL THAT MIGHTE RECKON'D BE
A FALCON PEREGRINE SEEMED SHE
OF FREMDE LAND AND EVER AS SHE STOOD FOREIGN 28
SHE SWOONED NOW AND NOW FOR LACK OF BLOOD
TILL WELL NIGH IS SHE FALLEN FROM THE TREE
THIS FAIRE KINGE'S DAUGHTER CANACE
THAT ON HER FINGER BARE THE QUAINTE RING
THROUGH WHICH SHE UNDERSTOOD WELL EVERY THING
THAT ANY FOWL MAY IN HIS LEDEN SAYN LANGUAGE 29
AND COULD HIM ANSWER IN HIS LEDEN AGAIN
HATH UNDERSTOODE WHAT THIS FALCON SAID
AND WELL NIGH FOR THE RUTH ALMOST SHE DIED
PITY
AND TO THE TREE SHE WENT FULL HASTILY
AND ON THIS FALCON LOOKED PITEOUSLY
AND HELD HER LAP ABROAD FOR WELL SHE WIST
THE FALCON MUSTE FALLE FROM THE TWIST TWIG BOUGH
WHEN THAT SHE SWOONED NEXT FOR LACK OF BLOOD
A LONGE WHILE TO WAITE HER SHE STOOD
TILL AT THE LAST SHE APAKE IN THIS MANNERE
UNTO THE HAWK AS YE SHALL AFTER HEAR
WHAT IS THE CAUSE IF IT BE FOR TO TELL
THAT YE BE IN THIS FURIAL PAIN OF HELL RAGING FURIOUS
QUOTH CANACE UNTO THIS HAWK ABOVE
IS THIS FOR SORROW OF OF DEATH OR LOSS OF LOVE
FOR AS I TROW THESE BE THE CAUSES TWO BELIEVE
THAT CAUSE MOST A GENTLE HEARTE WOE
OF OTHER HARM IT NEEDETH NOT TO SPEAK
FOR YE YOURSELF UPON YOURSELF AWREAK INFLICT
WHICH PROVETH WELL THAT EITHER IRE OR DREAD FEAR
MUST BE OCCASION OF YOUR CRUEL DEED
SINCE THAT I SEE NONE OTHER WIGHT YOU CHASE
FOR LOVE OF GOD AS DO YOURSELFE GRACE HAVE MERCY ON
OR WHAT MAY BE YOUR HELP FOR WEST NOR EAST YOURSELF
I NEVER SAW ERE NOW NO BIRD NOR BEAST
THAT FARED WITH HIMSELF SO PITEOUSLY
YE SLAY ME WITH YOUR SORROW VERILY
I HAVE OF YOU SO GREAT COMPASSIOUN
FOR GODDE'S LOVE COME FROM THE TREE ADOWN
AND AS I AM A KINGE'S DAUGHTER TRUE
IF THAT I VERILY THE CAUSES KNEW
OF YOUR DISEASE IF IT LAY IN MY MIGHT DISTRESS
I WOULD AMEND IT ERE THAT IT WERE NIGHT
SO WISLY HELP ME THE GREAT GOD OF KIND SURELY NATURE
AND HERBES SHALL I RIGHT ENOUGHE FIND
TO HEALE WITH YOUR HURTES HASTILY
THEN SHRIEK'D THIS FALCON YET MORE PITEOUSLY
THAN EVER SHE DID AND FELL TO GROUND ANON
AND LAY ASWOON AS DEAD AS LIES A STONE
TILL CANACE HAD IN HER LAP HER TAKE
UNTO THAT TIME SHE GAN OF SWOON AWAKE
AND AFTER THAT SHE OUT OF SWOON ABRAID AWOKE
RIGHT IN HER HAWKE'S LEDEN THUS SHE SAID
THAT PITY RUNNETH SOON IN GENTLE HEART
FEELING HIS SIMIL'TUDE IN PAINES SMART
IS PROVED EVERY DAY AS MEN MAY SEE
AS WELL BY WORK AS BY AUTHORITY BY EXPERIENCE AS BY DOCTRINE
FOR GENTLE HEARTE KITHETH GENTLENESS
SHEWETH
I SEE WELL THAT YE HAVE ON MY DISTRESS
COMPASSION MY FAIRE CANACE
OF VERY WOMANLY BENIGNITY
THAT NATURE IN YOUR PRINCPLES HATH SET
BUT FOR NO HOPE FOR TO FARE THE BET BETTER
BUT FOR T' OBEY UNTO YOUR HEARTE FREE
AND FOR TO MAKE OTHERS AWARE BY ME
AS BY THE WHELP CHASTIS'D IS THE LION INSTRUCTED CORRECTED
RIGHT FOR THAT CAUSE AND THAT CONCLUSION
WHILE THAT I HAVE A LEISURE AND A SPACE
MINE HARM I WILL CONFESSEN ERE I PACE DEPART
AND EVER WHILE THE ONE HER SORROW TOLD
THE OTHER WEPT AS SHE TO WATER WO'LD AS IF SHE WOULD DISSOLVE
TILL THAT THE FALCON BADE HER TO BE STILL INTO WATER
AND WITH A SIGH RIGHT THUS SHE SAID HER TILL TO HER
WHERE I WAS BRED ALAS THAT ILKE DAY SAME
AND FOSTER'D IN A ROCK OF MARBLE GRAY
SO TENDERLY THAT NOTHING AILED ME
I WISTE NOT WHAT WAS ADVERSITY KNEW
TILL I COULD FLEE FULL HIGH UNDER THE SKY
FLY
THEN DWELL'D A TERCELET 30 ME FASTE BY
THAT SEEM'D A WELL OF ALLE GENTLENESS
ALL WERE HE FULL OF TREASON AND FALSENESS ALTHOUGH HE WAS
IT WAS SO WRAPPED UNDER HUMBLE CHEER UNDER AN ASPECT
AND UNDER HUE OF TRUTH IN SUCH MANNERE OF HUMILITY
UNDER PLEASANCE AND UNDER BUSY PAIN
THAT NO WIGHT WEENED THAT HE COULDE FEIGN
SO DEEP IN GRAIN HE DYED HIS COLOURS
RIGHT AS A SERPENT HIDES HIM UNDER FLOW'RS
TILL HE MAY SEE HIS TIME FOR TO BITE
RIGHT SO THIS GOD OF LOVE'S HYPOCRITE
DID SO HIS CEREMONIES AND OBEISANCES
AND KEPT IN SEMBLANCE ALL HIS OBSERVANCES
THAT SOUNDEN UNTO GENTLENESS OF LOVE
ARE CONSONANT TO
AS ON A TOMB IS ALL THE FAIR ABOVE
AND UNDER IS THE CORPSE WHICH THAT YE WET
SUCH WAS THIS HYPOCRITE BOTH COLD AND HOT
AND IN THIS WISE HE SERVED HIS INTENT
THAT SAVE THE FIEND NONE WISTE WHAT HE MEANT
TILL HE SO LONG HAD WEEPED AND COMPLAIN'D
AND MANY A YEAR HIS SERVICE TO ME FEIGN'D
TILL THAT MINE HEART TOO PITEOUS AND TOO NICE FOOLISH SIMPLE
ALL INNOCENT OF HIS CROWNED MALICE
FORFEARED OF HIS DEATH AS THOUGHTE ME GREATLY AFRAID LEST
UPON HIS OATHES AND HIS SURETY HE SHOULD DIE
GRANTED HIM LOVE ON THIS CONDITIOUN
THAT EVERMORE MINE HONOUR AND RENOWN
WERE SAVED BOTHE PRIVY AND APERT PRIVATELY AND IN PUBLIC
THIS IS TO SAY THAT AFTER HIS DESERT
I GAVE HIM ALL MY HEART AND ALL MY THOUGHT
GOD WOT AND HE THAT OTHER WAYES NOUGHT IN NO OTHER WAY
AND TOOK HIS HEART IN CHANGE OF MINE FOR AYE
BUT SOOTH IS SAID GONE SINCE MANY A DAY
A TRUE WIGHT AND A THIEFE THINK NOT ONE DO NOT THINK ALIKE
AND WHEN HE SAW THE THING SO FAR Y GONE
THAT I HAD GRANTED HIM FULLY MY LOVE
IN SUCH A WISE AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE
AND GIVEN HIM MY TRUE HEART AS FREE
AS HE SWORE THAT HE GAVE HIS HEART TO ME
ANON THIS TIGER FULL OF DOUBLENESS
FELL ON HIS KNEES WITH SO GREAT HUMBLENESS
WITH SO HIGH REVERENCE AS BY HIS CHEER MIEN
SO LIKE A GENTLE LOVER IN MANNERE
SO RAVISH'D AS IT SEEMED FOR THE JOY
THAT NEVER JASON NOR PARIS OF TROY
JASON CERTES NOR EVER OTHER MAN
SINCE LAMECH 31 WAS THAT ALDERFIRST BEGAN FIRST OF ALL
TO LOVE TWO AS WRITE FOLK BEFORN
NOR EVER SINCE THE FIRSTE MAN WAS BORN
COULDE NO MAN BY TWENTY THOUSAND
COUNTERFEIT THE SOPHIMES OF HIS ART SOPHISTRIES BEGUILEMENTS
WHERE DOUBLENESS OF FEIGNING SHOULD APPROACH
NOR WORTHY WERE T'UNBUCKLE HIS GALOCHE SHOE 32
NOR COULD SO THANK A WIGHT AS HE DID ME
HIS MANNER WAS A HEAVEN FOR TO SEE
TO ANY WOMAN WERE SHE NE'ER SO WISE
SO PAINTED HE AND KEMPT AT POINT DEVISE COMBED STUDIED
AS WELL HIS WORDES AS HIS COUNTENANCE
WITH PERFECT PRECISION
AND I SO LOV'D HIM FOR HIS OBEISANCE
AND FOR THE TRUTH I DEEMED IN HIS HEART
THAT IF SO WERE THAT ANY THING HIM SMART PAINED
ALL WERE IT NE'ER SO LITE AND I IT WIST LITTLE
METHOUGHT I FELT DEATH AT MY HEARTE TWIST
AND SHORTLY SO FARFORTH THIS THING IS WENT GONE
THAT MY WILL WAS HIS WILLE'S INSTRUMENT
THAT IS TO SAY MY WILL OBEY'D HIS WILL
IN ALLE THING AS FAR AS REASON FILL FELL ALLOWED
KEEPING THE BOUNDES OF MY WORSHIP EVER
AND NEVER HAD I THING SO LEFE OR LEVER SO DEAR OR DEARER
AS HIM GOD WOT NOR NEVER SHALL NO MO'
THIS LASTED LONGER THAN A YEAR OR TWO
THAT I SUPPOSED OF HIM NAUGHT BUT GOOD
BUT FINALLY THUS AT THE LAST IT STOOD
THAT FORTUNE WOULDE THAT HE MUSTE TWIN DEPART SEPARATE
OUT OF THAT PLACE WHICH THAT I WAS IN
WHE'ER ME WAS WOE IT IS NO QUESTION WHETHER
I CANNOT MAKE OF IT DESCRIPTION
FOR ONE THING DARE I TELLE BOLDELY
I KNOW WHAT IS THE PAIN OF DEATH THEREBY
SUCH HARM I FELT FOR HE MIGHT NOT BYLEVE STAY 33
SO ON A DAY OF ME HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
SO SORROWFUL EKE THAT I WEEN'D VERILY
THAT HE HAD FELT AS MUCHE HARM AS I
WHEN THAT I HEARD HIM SPEAK AND SAW HIS HUE
BUT NATHELESS I THOUGHT HE WAS SO TRUE
AND EKE THAT HE REPAIRE SHOULD AGAIN
WITHIN A LITTLE WHILE SOOTH TO SAYN
AND REASON WOULD EKE THAT HE MUSTE GO
FOR HIS HONOUR AS OFTEN HAPP'NETH SO
THAT I MADE VIRTUE OF NECESSITY
AND TOOK IT WELL SINCE THAT IT MUSTE BE
AS I BEST MIGHT I HID FROM HIM MY SORROW
AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND SAINT JOHN TO BORROW WITNESS PLEDGE
AND SAID HIM THUS 'LO I AM YOURES ALL
BE SUCH AS I HAVE BEEN TO YOU AND SHALL
WHAT HE ANSWER'D IT NEEDS NOT TO REHEARSE
WHO CAN SAY BET THAN HE WHO CAN DO WORSE BETTER
WHEN HE HAD ALL WELL SAID THEN HAD HE DONE
THEREFORE BEHOVETH HIM A FULL LONG SPOON
THAT SHALL EAT WITH A FIEND THUS HEARD I SAY
SO AT THE LAST HE MUSTE FORTH HIS WAY
AND FORTH HE FLEW TILL HE CAME WHERE HIM LEST
WHEN IT CAME HIM TO PURPOSE FOR TO REST
I TROW THAT HE HAD THILKE TEXT IN MIND
THAT ALLE THING REPAIRING TO HIS KIND
GLADDETH HIMSELF 34 THUS SAY MEN AS I GUESS
MEN LOVE OF PROPER KIND NEWFANGLENESS SEE NOTE 35
AS BIRDES DO THAT MEN IN CAGES FEED
FOR THOUGH THOU NIGHT AND DAY TAKE OF THEM HEED
AND STREW THEIR CAGE FAIR AND SOFT AS SILK
AND GIVE THEM SUGAR HONEY BREAD AND MILK
YET RIGHT ANON AS THAT HIS DOOR IS UP IMMEDIATELY ON HIS
HE WITH HIS FEET WILL SPURNE DOWN HIS CUP DOOR BEING OPENED
AND TO THE WOOD HE WILL AND WORMES EAT
SO NEWEFANGLE BE THEY OF THEIR MEAT
AND LOVE NOVELTIES OF PROPER KIND
NO GENTLENESS OF BLOODE MAY THEM BIND
SO FAR'D THIS TERCELET ALAS THE DAY
THOUGH HE WERE GENTLE BORN AND FRESH AND GAY
AND GOODLY FOR TO SEE AND HUMBLE AND FREE
HE SAW UPON A TIME A KITE FLEE FLY
AND SUDDENLY HE LOVED THIS KITE SO
THAT ALL HIS LOVE IS CLEAN FROM ME Y GO
AND HATH HIS TROTHE FALSED IN THIS WISE
THUS HATH THE KITE MY LOVE IN HER SERVICE
AND I AM LORN WITHOUTE REMEDY LOST UNDONE
AND WITH THAT WORD THIS FALCON GAN TO CRY
AND SWOONED EFT IN CANACEE'S BARME AGAIN LAP
GREAT WAS THE SORROW FOR THAT HAWKE'S HARM
THAT CANACE AND ALL HER WOMEN MADE
THEY WIST NOT HOW THEY MIGHT THE FALCON GLADE GLADDEN
BUT CANACE HOME BARE HER IN HER LAP
AND SOFTELY IN PLASTERS GAN HER WRAP
THERE AS SHE WITH HER BEAK HAD HURT HERSELVE
NOW CANNOT CANACE BUT HERBES DELVE
OUT OF THE GROUND AND MAKE SALVES NEW
OF HERBES PRECIOUS AND FINE OF HUE
TO HEALE WITH THIS HAWK FROM DAY TO NIGHT
SHE DID HER BUSINESS AND ALL HER MIGHT
AND BY HER BEDDE'S HEAD SHE MADE A MEW BIRD CAGE
AND COVER'D IT WITH VELOUETTES BLUE 36 VELVETS
IN SIGN OF TRUTH THAT IS IN WOMAN SEEN
AND ALL WITHOUT THE MEW IS PAINTED GREEN
IN WHICH WERE PAINTED ALL THESE FALSE FOWLS
AS BE THESE TIDIFES TERCELETS AND OWLS TITMICE
AND PIES ON THEM FOR TO CRY AND CHIDE
RIGHT FOR DESPITE WERE PAINTED THEM BESIDE
THUS LEAVE I CANACE HER HAWK KEEPING
I WILL NO MORE AS NOW SPEAK OF HER RING
TILL IT COME EFT TO PURPOSE FOR TO SAYN AGAIN
HOW THAT THIS FALCON GOT HER LOVE AGAIN
REPENTANT AS THE STORY TELLETH US
BY MEDIATION OF CAMBALLUS
THE KINGE'S SON OF WHICH THAT I YOU TOLD
BUT HENCEFORTH I WILL MY PROCESS HOLD
TO SPEAK OF AVENTURES AND OF BATTAILES
THAT YET WAS NEVER HEARD SO GREAT MARVAILLES
FIRST I WILL TELLE YOU OF CAMBUSCAN
THAT IN HIS TIME MANY A CITY WAN
AND AFTER WILL I SPEAK OF ALGARSIFE
HOW HE WON THEODORA TO HIS WIFE
FOR WHOM FULL OFT IN GREAT PERIL HE WAS
N'HAD HE BEEN HOLPEN BY THE HORSE OF BRASS
HAD HE NOT
AND AFTER WILL I SPEAK OF CAMBALLO 37
THAT FOUGHT IN LISTES WITH THE BRETHREN TWO
FOR CANACE ERE THAT HE MIGHT HER WIN
AND WHERE I LEFT I WILL AGAIN BEGIN

NOTES TO THE SQUIRE'S TALE
1
THE SQUIRE'S TALE HAS NOT BEEN FOUND UNDER ANY OTHER FORM
AMONG THE LITERARY REMAINS OF THE MIDDLE AGES AND IT IS
UNKNOWN FROM WHAT ORIGINAL IT WAS DERIVED IF FROM ANY
THE
TALE IS UNFINISHED NOT BECAUSE THE CONCLUSION HAS BEEN LOST BUT
BECAUSE THE AUTHOR LEFT IT SO
2
THE RUSSIANS AND TARTARS WAGED CONSTANT HOSTILITIES BETWEEN
THE THIRTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES
3
IN THE BEST MANUSCRIPTS THE NAME IS CAMBYNSKAN AND THUS
NO DOUBT IT SHOULD STRICTLY BE READ
BUT IT IS A MOST PARDONABLE
OFFENCE AGAINST LITERAL ACCURACY TO USE THE WORD WHICH MILTON
HAS MADE CLASSICAL IN IL PENSEROSO SPEAKING OF
HIM THAT LEFT HALF TOLD
THE STORY OF CAMBUSCAN BOLD
OF CAMBALL AND OF ALGARSIFE
AND WHO HAD CANACE TO WIFE
THAT OWNED THE VIRTUOUS RING AND GLASS
AND OF THE WONDROUS HORSE OF BRASS
ON WHICH THE TARTAR KING DID RIDE
SURELY THE ADMIRATION OF MILTON MIGHT WELL SEEM TO THE SPIRIT OF
CHAUCER TO CONDONE A MUCH GREATER TRANSGRESSION ON HIS DOMAIN
THAN THIS VERBAL CHANGE WHICH TO BOTH EYE AND EAR IS AN
UNQUESTIONABLE IMPROVEMENT ON THE UNCOUTH ORIGINAL

SEWES DISHES OR SOUPS
THE PRECISE FORCE OF THE WORD IS
UNCERTAIN BUT IT MAY BE CONNECTED WITH SEETHE TO BOIL AND IT
SEEMS TO DESCRIBE A DISH IN WHICH THE FLESH WAS SERVED UP AMID A
KIND OF BROTH OR GRAVY
THE SEWER TASTER OR ASSAYER OF THE
VIANDS SERVED AT GREAT TABLES PROBABLY DERIVED HIS NAME FROM
THE VERB TO SAY OR ASSAY THOUGH TYRWHITT WOULD CONNECT
THE TWO WORDS BY TAKING BOTH FROM THE FRENCH ASSEOIR TO
PLACE MAKING THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE TABLE THE LEADING DUTY OF

RENDERED IN CHAUCER'S TRANSLATION ALL THINGS SEEK AYE TO THEIR
PROPER COURSE AND ALL THINGS REJOICE ON THEIR RETURNING AGAIN TO
THEIR NATURE

MEN LOVE OF PROPER KIND NEWFANGLENESS MEN BY THEIR OWN
THEIR VERY NATURE ARE FOND OF NOVELTY AND PRONE TO
INCONSTANCY
36
BLUE WAS THE COLOUR OF TRUTH AS GREEN WAS THAT OF
INCONSTANCY
IN JOHN STOWE'S ADDITIONS TO CHAUCER'S WORKS
PRINTED IN 1561 THERE IS A BALADE WHICHE CHAUCER MADE
AGAINST WOMEN INCONSTAUNT OF WHICH THE REFRAIN IS IN STEAD OF
BLUE THUS MAY YE WEAR ALL GREEN
37
UNLESS WE SUPPOSE THIS TO BE A NAMESAKE OF THE CAMBALLO
WHO WAS CANACE'S BROTHER WHICH IS NOT AT ALL PROBABLE WE
MUST AGREE WITH TYRWHITT THAT THERE IS A MISTAKE HERE WHICH NO
DOUBT CHAUCER WOULD HAVE RECTIFIED IF THE TALE HAD NOT BEEN
LEFT HALF TOLD ONE MANUSCRIPT READS CABALLO AND THOUGH NOT
MUCH AUTHORITY NEED BE GIVEN TO A DIFFERENCE THAT MAY BE DUE TO
MERE OMISSION OF THE MARK OF CONTRACTION OVER THE A THERE IS
ENOUGH IN THE TEXT TO SHOW THAT ANOTHER PERSON THAN THE KING'S
YOUNGER SON IS INTENDED
THE SQUIRE PROMISES TO TELL THE
ADVENTURES THAT BEFELL EACH MEMBER OF CAMBUSCAN'S FAMILY AND
IN THOROUGH CONSISTENCY WITH THIS PLAN AND WITH THE CANONS OF
CHIVALRIC STORY WOULD BE THE MARRIAGE OF CANACE TO SOME
KNIGHT WHO WAS FIRST OBLIGED TO FIGHT FOR HER WITH HER TWO
BRETHREN A METHOD OF COURTSHIP ADDS TYRWHITT VERY
CONSONANT TO THE SPIRIT OF ANCIENT CHIVALRY

BUT IF YOU LIST MY TALE SHALL YE HEAR
NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE FRANKLIN'S TALE
1
IN THE OLDER EDITIONS THE VERSES HERE GIVEN AS THE PROLOGUE
WERE PREFIXED TO THE MERCHANT'S TALE AND PUT INTO HIS MOUTH
TYRWHITT WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED BY THE INTERNAL EVIDENCE
AFFORDED BY THE LINES THEMSELVES IN TRANSFERRING THEM TO THEIR
PRESENT PLACE
2
THE BRETON LAYS WERE AN IMPORTANT AND CURIOUS ELEMENT IN
THE LITERATURE OF THE MIDDLE AGES THEY WERE ORIGINALLY
COMPOSED IN THE ARMORICAN LANGUAGE AND THE CHIEF COLLECTION
OF THEM EXTANT WAS TRANSLATED INTO FRENCH VERSE BY A POETESS
CALLING HERSELF MARIE ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE THIRTEENTH
CENTURY
BUT THOUGH THIS COLLECTION WAS THE MOST FAMOUS AND
HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN READ BY CHAUCER THERE WERE OTHER BRITISH OR
BRETON LAYS AND FROM ONE OF THOSE THE FRANKLIN'S TALE IS TAKEN
BOCCACCIO HAS DEALT WITH THE SAME STORY IN THE DECAMERON
AND THE PHILOCOPO ALTERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO SUIT THE
REMOVAL OF ITS SCENE TO A SOUTHERN CLIME
THE TALE
IN ARMORIC' THAT CALLED IS BRETAGNE
THERE WAS A KNIGHT THAT LOV'D AND DID HIS PAIN DEVOTED HIMSELF
TO SERVE A LADY IN HIS BESTE WISE STROVE
AND MANY A LABOUR MANY A GREAT EMPRISE ENTERPRISE
HE FOR HIS LADY WROUGHT ERE SHE WERE WON
FOR SHE WAS ONE THE FAIREST UNDER SUN
AND EKE THERETO COME OF SO HIGH KINDRED
THAT WELL UNNETHES DURST THIS KNIGHT FOR DREAD SEE NOTE 1
TELL HER HIS WOE HIS PAIN AND HIS DISTRESS
BUT AT THE LAST SHE FOR HIS WORTHINESS
AND NAMELY FOR HIS MEEK OBEISANCE ESPECIALLY
HATH SUCH A PITY CAUGHT OF HIS PENANCE SUFFERING DISTRESS
THAT PRIVILY SHE FELL OF HIS ACCORD
TO TAKE HIM FOR HER HUSBAND AND HER LORD
OF SUCH LORDSHIP AS MEN HAVE O'ER THEIR WIVES
AND FOR TO LEAD THE MORE IN BLISS THEIR LIVES
OF HIS FREE WILL HE SWORE HER AS A KNIGHT
THAT NEVER IN ALL HIS LIFE HE DAY NOR NIGHT
SHOULD TAKE UPON HIMSELF NO MASTERY
AGAINST HER WILL NOR KITHE HER JEALOUSY SHOW
BUT HER OBEY AND FOLLOW HER WILL IN ALL
AS ANY LOVER TO HIS LADY SHALL
SAVE THAT THE NAME OF SOVEREIGNETY
THAT WOULD HE HAVE FOR SHAME OF HIS DEGREE
SHE THANKED HIM AND WITH FULL GREAT HUMBLESS
SHE SAIDE SIR SINCE OF YOUR GENTLENESS
YE PROFFER ME TO HAVE SO LARGE A REIGN
NE WOULDE GOD NEVER BETWIXT US TWAIN
AS IN MY GUILT WERE EITHER WAR OR STRIFE SEE NOTE 2
SIR I WILL BE YOUR HUMBLE TRUE WIFE
HAVE HERE MY TROTH TILL THAT MY HEARTE BREST BURST
THUS BE THEY BOTH IN QUIET AND IN REST
FOR ONE THING SIRES SAFELY DARE I SAY
THAT FRIENDS EVER EACH OTHER MUST OBEY
IF THEY WILL LONGE HOLD IN COMPANY
LOVE WILL NOT BE CONSTRAIN'D BY MASTERY
WHEN MAST'RY COMES THE GOD OF LOVE ANON
BEATETH 3 HIS WINGS AND FAREWELL HE IS GONE
LOVE IS A THING AS ANY SPIRIT FREE
WOMEN OF KIND DESIRE LIBERTY BY NATURE
AND NOT TO BE CONSTRAINED AS A THRALL SLAVE
AND SO DO MEN IF SOOTHLY I SAY SHALL
LOOK WHO THAT IS MOST PATIENT IN LOVE
HE IS AT HIS ADVANTAGE ALL ABOVE ENJOYS THE HIGHEST
PATIENCE IS A HIGH VIRTUE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES OF ALL
FOR IT VANQUISHETH AS THESE CLERKES SAYN
THINGES THAT RIGOUR NEVER SHOULD ATTAIN
FOR EVERY WORD MEN MAY NOT CHIDE OR PLAIN
LEARNE TO SUFFER OR SO MAY I GO PROSPER
YE SHALL IT LEARN WHETHER YE WILL OR NO
FOR IN THIS WORLD CERTAIN NO WIGHT THERE IS
THAT HE NOT DOTH OR SAITH SOMETIMES AMISS
IRE OR SICKNESS OR CONSTELLATION THE INFLUENCE OF
WINE WOE OR CHANGING OF COMPLEXION THE PLANETS
CAUSETH FULL OFT TO DO AMISS OR SPEAKEN
ON EVERY WRONG A MAN MAY NOT BE WREAKEN REVENGED
AFTER THE TIME MUST BE TEMPERANCE ACCORDING TO
TO EVERY WIGHT THAT CAN OF GOVERNANCE
IS CAPABLE OF
AND THEREFORE HATH THIS WORTHY WISE KNIGHT
TO LIVE IN EASE SUFFERANCE HER BEHIGHT PROMISED
AND SHE TO HIM FULL WISLY GAN TO SWEAR SURELY
THAT NEVER SHOULD THERE BE DEFAULT IN HER
HERE MAY MEN SEE A HUMBLE WIFE ACCORD
THUS HATH SHE TA'EN HER SERVANT AND HER LORD
SERVANT IN LOVE AND LORD IN MARRIAGE
THEN WAS HE BOTH IN LORDSHIP AND SERVAGE
SERVAGE NAY BUT IN LORDSHIP ALL ABOVE
SINCE HE HAD BOTH HIS LADY AND HIS LOVE
HIS LADY CERTES AND HIS WIFE ALSO
THE WHICH THAT LAW OF LOVE ACCORDETH TO
AND WHEN HE WAS IN THIS PROSPERRITY
HOME WITH HIS WIFE HE WENT TO HIS COUNTRY
NOT FAR FROM PENMARK 4 WHERE HIS DWELLING WAS
AND THERE HE LIV'D IN BLISS AND IN SOLACE DELIGHT
WHO COULDE TELL BUT HE HAD WEDDED BE UNLESS
THE JOY THE EASE AND THE PROSPERITY
THAT IS BETWIXT A HUSBAND AND HIS WIFE
A YEAR AND MORE LASTED THIS BLISSFUL LIFE
TILL THAT THIS KNIGHT OF WHOM I SPAKE THUS
THAT OF CAIRRUD 5 WAS CALL'D ARVIRAGUS
SHOPE HIM TO GO AND DWELL A YEAR OR TWAIN PREPARED ARRANGED
IN ENGLELAND THAT CALL'D WAS EKE BRITAIN
TO SEEK IN ARMES WORSHIP AND HONOUR
FOR ALL HIS LUST HE SET IN SUCH LABOUR PLEASURE
AND DWELLED THERE TWO YEARS THE BOOK SAITH THUS
NOW WILL I STINT OF THIS ARVIRAGUS CEASE SPEAKING
AND SPEAK I WILL OF DORIGEN HIS WIFE
THAT LOV'D HER HUSBAND AS HER HEARTE'S LIFE
FOR HIS ABSENCE WEEPETH SHE AND SIKETH SIGHETH
AS DO THESE NOBLE WIVES WHEN THEM LIKETH
SHE MOURNETH WAKETH WAILETH FASTETH PLAINETH
DESIRE OF HIS PRESENCE HER SO DISTRAINETH
THAT ALL THIS WIDE WORLD SHE SET AT NOUGHT
HER FRIENDES WHICH THAT KNEW HER HEAVY THOUGHT
COMFORTE HER IN ALL THAT EVER THEY MAY
THEY PREACHE HER THEY TELL HER NIGHT AND DAY
THAT CAUSELESS SHE SLAYS HERSELF ALAS
AND EVERY COMFORT POSSIBLE IN THIS CASE
THEY DO TO HER WITH ALL THEIR BUSINESS ASSIDUITY
AND ALL TO MAKE HER LEAVE HER HEAVINESS
BY PROCESS AS YE KNOWEN EVERY ONE
MEN MAY SO LONGE GRAVEN IN A STONE
TILL SOME FIGURE THEREIN IMPRINTED BE
SO LONG HAVE THEY COMFORTED HER TILL SHE
RECEIVED HATH BY HOPE AND BY REASON
TH' IMPRINTING OF THEIR CONSOLATION
THROUGH WHICH HER GREATE SORROW GAN ASSUAGE
SHE MAY NOT ALWAYS DUREN IN SUCH RAGE
AND EKE ARVIRAGUS IN ALL THIS CARE
HATH SENT HIS LETTERS HOME OF HIS WELFARE
AND THAT HE WILL COME HASTILY AGAIN
OR ELLES HAD THIS SORROW HER HEARTY SLAIN
HER FRIENDES SAW HER SORROW GIN TO SLAKE SLACKEN DIMINISH
AND PRAYED HER ON KNEES FOR GODDE'S SAKE
TO COME AND ROAMEN IN THEIR COMPANY
AWAY TO DRIVE HER DARKE FANTASY
AND FINALLY SHE GRANTED THAT REQUEST
FOR WELL SHE SAW THAT IT WAS FOR THE BEST
NOW STOOD HER CASTLE FASTE BY THE SEA
AND OFTEN WITH HER FRIENDES WALKED SHE
HER TO DISPORT UPON THE BANK ON HIGH
THERE AS MANY A SHIP AND BARGE SIGH SAW
SAILING THEIR COURSES WHERE THEM LIST TO GO
BUT THEN WAS THAT A PARCEL OF HER WOE PART
FOR TO HERSELF FULL OFT ALAS SAID SHE
IS THERE NO SHIP OF SO MANY AS I SEE
WILL BRINGE HOME MY LORD THEN WERE MY HEART
ALL WARISH'D OF THIS BITTER PAINE'S SMART CURED 6
ANOTHER TIME WOULD SHE SIT AND THINK
AND CAST HER EYEN DOWNWARD FROM THE BRINK
BUT WHEN SHE SAW THE GRISLY ROCKES BLAKE BLACK
FOR VERY FEAR SO WOULD HER HEARTE QUAKE
THAT ON HER FEET SHE MIGHT HER NOT SUSTENE SUSTAIN
THEN WOULD SHE SIT ADOWN UPON THE GREEN
AND PITEOUSLY INTO THE SEA BEHOLD LOOK OUT ON THE SEA
AND SAY RIGHT THUS WITH CAREFUL SIKES COLD PAINFUL SIGHS
ETERNAL GOD THAT THROUGH THY PURVEYANCE
LEADEST THIS WORLD BY CERTAIN GOVERNANCE
IN IDLE AS MEN SAY YE NOTHING MAKE IDLY IN VAIN
BUT LORD THESE GRISLY FIENDLY ROCKES BLAKE
THAT SEEM RATHER A FOUL CONFUSION
OF WORK THAN ANY FAIR CREATION
OF SUCH A PERFECT WISE GOD AND STABLE
WHY HAVE YE WROUGHT THIS WORK UNREASONABLE
FOR BY THIS WORK NORTH SOUTH OR WEST OR EAST
THERE IS NOT FOSTER'D MAN NOR BIRD NOR BEAST
IT DOTH NO GOOD TO MY WIT BUT ANNOYETH WORKS MISCHIEF 7
SEE YE NOT LORD HOW MANKIND IT DESTROYETH
A HUNDRED THOUSAND BODIES OF MANKIND
HAVE ROCKES SLAIN ALL BE THEY NOT IN MIND THOUGH THEY ARE
WHICH MANKIND IS SO FAIR PART OF THY WORK FORGOTTEN
THOU MADEST IT LIKE TO THINE OWEN MARK IMAGE
THEN SEEMED IT YE HAD A GREAT CHERTE LOVE AFFECTION
TOWARD MANKIND BUT HOW THEN MAY IT BE
THAT YE SUCH MEANES MAKE IT TO DESTROY
WHICH MEANES DO NO GOOD BUT EVER ANNOY
I WOT WELL CLERKES WILL SAY AS THEM LEST PLEASE
BY ARGUMENTS THAT ALL IS FOR THE BEST
ALTHOUGH I CAN THE CAUSES NOT Y KNOW
BUT THILKE GOD THAT MADE THE WIND TO BLOW THAT
AS KEEP MY LORD THIS IS MY CONCLUSION
TO CLERKS LEAVE I ALL DISPUTATION
BUT WOULD TO GOD THAT ALL THESE ROCKES BLAKE
WERE SUNKEN INTO HELLE FOR HIS SAKE
THESE ROCKES SLAY MINE HEARTE FOR THE FEAR
THUS WOULD SHE SAY WITH MANY A PITEOUS TEAR
HER FRIENDES SAW THAT IT WAS NO DISPORT
TO ROAME BY THE SEA BUT DISCOMFORT
AND SHOPE THEM FOR TO PLAYE SOMEWHERE ELSE
ARRANGED
THEY LEADE HER BY RIVERS AND BY WELLS
AND EKE IN OTHER PLACES DELECTABLES
THEY DANCEN AND THEY PLAY AT CHESS AND TABLES BACKGAMMON
SO ON A DAY RIGHT IN THE MORNING TIDE
UNTO A GARDEN THAT WAS THERE BESIDE
IN WHICH THAT THEY HAD MADE THEIR ORDINANCE PROVISION ARRANGEMENT
OF VICTUAL AND OF OTHER PURVEYANCE
THEY GO AND PLAY THEM ALL THE LONGE DAY
AND THIS WAS ON THE SIXTH MORROW OF MAY
WHICH MAY HAD PAINTED WITH HIS SOFTE SHOWERS
THIS GARDEN FULL OF LEAVES AND OF FLOWERS
AND CRAFT OF MANNE'S HAND SO CURIOUSLY
ARRAYED HAD THIS GARDEN TRUELY
THAT NEVER WAS THERE GARDEN OF SUCH PRICE VALUE PRAISE
BUT IF IT WERE THE VERY PARADISE
UNLESS
TH'ODOUR OF FLOWERS AND THE FRESHE SIGHT
WOULD HAVE MAKED ANY HEARTE LIGHT
THAT E'ER WAS BORN BUT IF TOO GREAT SICKNESS UNLESS
OR TOO GREAT SORROW HELD IT IN DISTRESS
SO FULL IT WAS OF BEAUTY AND PLEASANCE
AND AFTER DINNER THEY BEGAN TO DANCE
AND SING ALSO SAVE DORIGEN ALONE
WHO MADE ALWAY HER COMPLAINT AND HER MOAN
FOR SHE SAW NOT HIM ON THE DANCE GO
THAT WAS HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVE ALSO
BUT NATHELESS SHE MUST A TIME ABIDE
AND WITH GOOD HOPE LET HER SORROW SLIDE
UPON THIS DANCE AMONGE OTHER MEN
DANCED A SQUIER BEFORE DORIGEN
THAT FRESHER WAS AND JOLLIER OF ARRAY
AS TO MY DOOM THAN IS THE MONTH OF MAY
IN MY JUDGMENT
HE SANG AND DANCED PASSING ANY MAN
THAT IS OR WAS SINCE THAT THE WORLD BEGAN
THEREWITH HE WAS IF MEN SHOULD HIM DESCRIVE
ONE OF THE BESTE FARING MEN ALIVE MOST ACCOMPLISHED
YOUNG STRONG AND VIRTUOUS AND RICH AND WISE
AND WELL BELOVED AND HOLDEN IN GREAT PRICE ESTEEM VALUE
AND SHORTLY IF THE SOOTH I TELLE SHALL
UNWEETING OF THIS DORIGEN AT ALL UNKNOWN TO
THIS LUSTY SQUIER SERVANT TO VENUS
WHICH THAT Y CALLED WAS AURELIUS
HAD LOV'D HER BEST OF ANY CREATURE
TWO YEAR AND MORE AS WAS HIS AVENTURE FORTUNE
BUT NEVER DURST HE TELL HER HIS GRIEVANCE
WITHOUTE CUP HE DRANK ALL HIS PENANCE
HE WAS DESPAIRED NOTHING DURST HE SAY
SAVE IN HIS SONGES SOMEWHAT WOULD HE WRAY BETRAY
HIS WOE AS IN A GENERAL COMPLAINING
HE SAID HE LOV'D AND WAS BELOV'D NOTHING
OF SUCHE MATTER MADE HE MANY LAYS
SONGES COMPLAINTES ROUNDELS VIRELAYS 8
HOW THAT HE DURSTE NOT HIS SORROW TELL
BUT LANGUISHED AS DOTH A FURY IN HELL
AND DIE HE MUST HE SAID AS DID ECHO
FOR NARCISSUS THAT DURST NOT TELL HER WOE
IN OTHER MANNER THAN YE HEAR ME SAY
HE DURSTE NOT TO HER HIS WOE BEWRAY
SAVE THAT PARAVENTURE SOMETIMES AT DANCES
WHERE YOUNGE FOLKE KEEP THEIR OBSERVANCES
IT MAY WELL BE HE LOOKED ON HER FACE
IN SUCH A WISE AS MAN THAT ASKETH GRACE
BUT NOTHING WISTE SHE OF HIS INTENT
NATH'LESS IT HAPPEN'D ERE THEY THENNES WENT THENCE FROM THE

THEN CAME HER OTHER FRIENDS MANY A ONE
AND IN THE ALLEYS ROAMED UP AND DOWN

HE NOT INTENDED TO NO SUCH MATTERE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH
BUT DANCED JOUSTED AND MADE MERRY CHEER
AND THUS IN JOY AND BLISS I LET THEM DWELL
AND OF THE SICK AURELIUS WILL I TELL
IN LANGUOR AND IN TORMENT FURIOUS
TWO YEAR AND MORE LAY WRETCH'D AURELIUS

NOR COMFORT IN THIS TIME HAD HE NONE
SAVE OF HIS BROTHER WHICH THAT WAS A CLERK SCHOLAR
HE KNEW OF ALL THIS WOE AND ALL THIS WORK
FOR TO NONE OTHER CREATURE CERTAIN
OF THIS MATTER HE DURST NO WORDE SAYN
UNDER HIS BREAST HE BARE IT MORE SECREE
THAN E'ER DID PAMPHILUS FOR GALATEE 10
HIS BREAST WAS WHOLE WITHOUTE FOR TO SEEN
BUT IN HIS HEART AYE WAS THE ARROW KEEN
AND WELL YE KNOW THAT OF A SURSANURE 11
IN SURGERY IS PERILOUS THE CURE
BUT MEN MIGHT TOUCH THE ARROW OR COME THEREBY
EXCEPT
HIS BROTHER WEPT AND WAILED PRIVILY
TILL AT THE LAST HIM FELL IN REMEMBRANCE
THAT WHILE HE WAS AT ORLEANS 12 IN FRANCE
AS YOUNGE CLERKES THAT BE LIKEROUS EAGER
TO READEN ARTES THAT BE CURIOUS
SEEKEN IN EVERY HALK AND EVERY HERN NOOK AND CORNER 13
PARTICULAR SCIENCES FOR TO LEARN
HE HIM REMEMBER'D THAT UPON A DAY
AT ORLEANS IN STUDY A BOOK HE SAY SAW
OF MAGIC NATURAL WHICH HIS FELLAW
THAT WAS THAT TIME A BACHELOR OF LAW
ALL WERE HE THERE TO LEARN ANOTHER CRAFT THOUGH
HAD PRIVILY UPON HIS DESK Y LAFT
WHICH BOOK SPAKE MUCH OF OPERATIONS
TOUCHING THE EIGHT AND TWENTY MANSIONS
THAT LONGE TO THE MOON AND SUCH FOLLY
AS IN OUR DAYES IS NOT WORTH A FLY
FOR HOLY CHURCH'S FAITH IN OUR BELIEVE BELIEF CREED
US SUFF'RETH NONE ILLUSION TO GRIEVE
AND WHEN THIS BOOK WAS IN HIS REMEMBRANCE
ANON FOR JOY HIS HEART BEGAN TO DANCE
AND TO HIMSELF HE SAIDE PRIVILY
MY BROTHER SHALL BE WARISH'D HASTILY CURED
FOR I AM SICKER THAT THERE BE SCIENCES CERTAIN
BY WHICH MEN MAKE DIVERS APPARENCES
SUCH AS THESE SUBTLE TREGETOURES PLAY
TRICKSTERS 14
FOR OFT AT FEASTE'S HAVE I WELL HEARD SAY
THAT TREGETOURS WITHIN A HALLE LARGE
HAVE MADE COME IN A WATER AND A BARGE
AND IN THE HALLE ROWEN UP AND DOWN
SOMETIMES HATH SEEMED COME A GRIM LIOUN

SOMETIMES A VINE AND GRAPES WHITE AND RED
SOMETIMES A CASTLE ALL OF LIME AND STONE
AND WHEN THEM LIKED VOIDED IT ANON VANISHED
THUS SEEMED IT TO EVERY MANNE'S SIGHT
NOW THEN CONCLUDE I THUS IF THAT I MIGHT
AT ORLEANS SOME OLDE FELLOW FIND
THAT HATH THESE MOONE'S MANSIONS IN MIND
OR OTHER MAGIC NATURAL ABOVE
HE SHOULD WELL MAKE MY BROTHER HAVE HIS LOVE
FOR WITH AN APPEARANCE A CLERK MAY MAKE LEARNED MAN
TO MANNE'S SIGHT THAT ALL THE ROCKES BLAKE
OF BRETAGNE WERE VOIDED EVERY ONE REMOVED
AND SHIPPES BY THE BRINKE COME AND GON
AND IN SUCH FORM ENDURE A DAY OR TWO
THEN WERE MY BROTHER WARISH'D OF HIS WOE CURED
THEN MUST SHE NEEDES HOLDE HER BEHEST KEEP HER PROMISE
OR ELLES HE SHALL SHAME HER AT THE LEAST
WHY SHOULD I MAKE A LONGER TALE OF THIS
UNTO HIS BROTHER'S BED HE COMEN IS
AND SUCH COMFORT HE GAVE HIM FOR TO GON
TO ORLEANS THAT HE UPSTART ANON
AND ON HIS WAY FORTH WARD THEN IS HE FARE GONE
IN HOPE FOR TO BE LISSED OF HIS CARE
EASED OF 15
WHEN THEY WERE COME ALMOST TO THAT CITY
BUT IF IT WERE A TWO FURLONG OR THREE ALL BUT
A YOUNG CLERK ROAMING BY HIMSELF THEY MET
WHICH THAT IN LATIN THRIFTILY THEM GRET GREETED THEM
AND AFTER THAT HE SAID A WONDROUS THING CIVILLY
I KNOW QUOTH HE THE CAUSE OF YOUR COMING
AUD ERE THEY FARTHER ANY FOOTE WENT
HE TOLD THEM ALL THAT WAS IN THEIR INTENT
THE BRETON CLERK HIM ASKED OF FELLAWS
THE WHICH HE HADDE KNOWN IN OLDE DAWS DAYS
AND HE ANSWER'D HIM THAT THEY DEADE WERE
FOR WHICH HE WEPT FULL OFTEN MANY A TEAR
DOWN OFF HIS HORSE AURELIUS LIGHT ANON
AND FORTH WITH THIS MAGICIAN IS BE GONE
HOME TO HIS HOUSE AND MADE HIM WELL AT EASE
THEM LACKED NO VITAIL THAT MIGHT THEM PLEASE
VICTUALS FOOD
SO WELL ARRAY'D A HOUSE AS THERE WAS ONE
AURELIUS IN HIS LIFE SAW NEVER NONE
HE SHEWED HIM ERE THEY WENT TO SUPPERE
FORESTES PARKES FULL OF WILDE DEER
THERE SAW HE HARTES WITH THEIR HORNES HIGH
THE GREATEST THAT WERE EVER SEEN WITH EYE
HE SAW OF THEM AN HUNDRED SLAIN WITH HOUNDS
AND SOME WITH ARROWS BLEED OF BITTER WOUNDS
HE SAW WHEN VOIDED WERE THE WILDE DEER PASSED AWAY
THESE FALCONERS UPON A FAIR RIVERE
THAT WITH THEIR HAWKES HAVE THE HERON SLAIN
THEN SAW HE KNIGHTES JOUSTING IN A PLAIN
AND AFTER THIS HE DID HIM SUCH PLEASANCE
THAT HE HIM SHEW'D HIS LADY ON A DANCE
IN WHICH HIMSELFE DANCED AS HIM THOUGHT
AND WHEN THIS MASTER THAT THIS MAGIC WROUGHT
SAW IT WAS TIME HE CLAPP'D HIS HANDES TWO
AND FAREWELL ALL THE REVEL IS Y GO GONE REMOVED
AND YET REMOV'D THEY NEVER OUT OF THE HOUSE
WHILE THEY SAW ALL THE SIGHTES MARVELLOUS
BUT IN HIS STUDY WHERE HIS BOOKES BE
THEY SATTE STILL AND NO WIGHT BUT THEY THREE
TO HIM THIS MASTER CALLED HIS SQUIER
AND SAID HIM THUS MAY WE GO TO SUPPER
ALMOST AN HOUR IT IS I UNDERTAKE
SINCE I YOU BADE OUR SUPPER FOR TO MAKE
WHEN THAT THESE WORTHY MEN WENTE WITH ME
INTO MY STUDY WHERE MY BOOKES BE
SIR QUOTH THIS SQUIER WHEN IT LIKETH YOU
IT IS ALL READY THOUGH YE WILL RIGHT NOW
GO WE THEN SUP QUOTH HE AS FOR THE BEST
THESE AMOROUS FOLK SOME TIME MUST HAVE REST
AT AFTER SUPPER FELL THEY IN TREATY
WHAT SUMME SHOULD THIS MASTER'S GUERDON BE REWARD
TO REMOVE ALL THE ROCKES OF BRETAGNE
AND EKE FROM GIRONDE 16 TO THE MOUTH OF SEINE
HE MADE IT STRANGE AND SWORE SO GOD HIM SAVE A MATTER OF
LESS THAN A THOUSAND POUND HE WOULD NOT HAVE DIFFICULTY
NOR GLADLY FOR THAT SUM HE WOULD NOT GON SEE NOTE 17
AURELIUS WITH BLISSFUL HEART ANON
ANSWERED THUS FIE ON A THOUSAND POUND
THIS WIDE WORLD WHICH THAT MEN SAY IS ROUND
I WOULD IT GIVE IF I WERE LORD OF IT
THIS BARGAIN IS FULL DRIV'N FOR WE BE KNIT AGREED
YE SHALL BE PAYED TRULY BY MY TROTH
BUT LOOKE FOR NO NEGLIGENCE OR SLOTH
YE TARRY US HERE NO LONGER THAN TO MORROW
NAY QUOTH THE CLERK HAVE HERE MY FAITH TO BORROW I PLEDGE MY
TO BED IS GONE AURELIUS WHEN HIM LEST FAITH ON IT
AND WELL NIGH ALL THAT NIGHT HE HAD HIS REST
WHAT FOR HIS LABOUR AND HIS HOPE OF BLISS
HIS WOEFUL HEART OF PENANCE HAD A LISS HAD A RESPITE
FROM SUFFERING
UPON THE MORROW WHEN THAT IT WAS DAY
UNTO BRETAGNE THEY TOOK THE RIGHTE WAY
AURELIUS AND THIS MAGICIAN BESIDE
AND BE DESCENDED WHERE THEY WOULD ABIDE
AND THIS WAS AS THE BOOKES ME REMEMBER
THE COLDE FROSTY SEASON OF DECEMBER
PHOEBUS WAX'D OLD AND HUED LIKE LATOUN BRASS
THAT IN HIS HOTE DECLINATIOUN
SHONE AS THE BURNED GOLD WITH STREAMES BRIGHT BEAMS
BUT NOW IN CAPRICORN ADOWN HE LIGHT
WHERE AS HE SHONE FULL PALE I DARE WELL SAYN
THE BITTER FROSTES WITH THE SLEET AND RAIN
DESTROYED HAVE THE GREEN IN EVERY YARD
COURTYARD GARDEN
JANUS SITS BY THE FIRE WITH DOUBLE BEARD
AND DRINKETH OF HIS BUGLE HORN THE WINE
BEFORE HIM STANDS THE BRAWN OF TUSKED SWINE
AND NOWEL CRIETH EVERY LUSTY MAN NOEL 18
AURELIUS IN ALL THAT EV'R HE CAN
DID TO HIS MASTER CHEER AND REVERENCE
AND PRAYED HIM TO DO HIS DILIGENCE
TO BRINGE HIM OUT OF HIS PAINES SMART
OR WITH A SWORD THAT HE WOULD SLIT HIS HEART
THIS SUBTLE CLERK SUCH RUTH HAD ON THIS MAN PITY
THAT NIGHT AND DAY HE SPED HIM THAT HE CAN
TO WAIT A TIME OF HIS CONCLUSION
THIS IS TO SAY TO MAKE ILLUSION
BY SUCH AN APPEARANCE OF JUGGLERY
I KNOW NO TERMES OF ASTROLOGY
THAT SHE AND EVERY WIGHT SHOULD WEEN AND SAY
THAT OF BRETAGNE THE ROCKES WERE AWAY
OR ELSE THEY WERE SUNKEN UNDER GROUND
SO AT THE LAST HE HATH A TIME FOUND
TO MAKE HIS JAPES AND HIS WRETCHEDNESS TRICKS
OF SUCH A SUPERSTITIOUS CURSEDNESS DETESTABLE VILLAINY
HIS TABLES TOLETANES 19 FORTH HE BROUGHT
FULL WELL CORRECTED THAT THERE LACKED NOUGHT
NEITHER HIS COLLECT NOR HIS EXPANSE YEARS
NEITHER HIS ROOTES NOR HIS OTHER GEARS
AS BE HIS CENTRES AND HIS ARGUMENTS
AND HIS PROPORTIONAL CONVENIENTS
FOR HIS EQUATIONS IN EVERYTHING
AND BY HIS EIGHTE SPHERES IN HIS WORKING
HE KNEW FULL WELL HOW FAR ALNATH 20 WAS SHOVE
FROM THE HEAD OF THAT FIX'D ARIES ABOVE
THAT IN THE NINTHE SPHERE CONSIDER'D IS
FULL SUBTILLY HE CALCUL'D ALL THIS
WHEN HE HAD FOUND HIS FIRSTE MANSION
HE KNEW THE REMNANT BY PROPORTION
AND KNEW THE RISING OF HIS MOONE WELL
AND IN WHOSE FACE AND TERM AND EVERY DEAL
AND KNEW FULL WELL THE MOONE'S MANSION
ACCORDANT TO HIS OPERATION
AND KNEW ALSO HIS OTHER OBSERVANCES
FOR SUCH ILLUSIONS AND SUCH MESCHANCES WICKED DEVICES
AS HEATHEN FOLK USED IN THILKE DAYS
FOR WHICH NO LONGER MADE HE DELAYS
BUT THROUGH HIS MAGIC FOR A DAY OR TWAY 21
IT SEEMED ALL THE ROCKES WERE AWAY
AURELIUS WHICH YET DESPAIRED IS
WHE'ER HE SHALL HAVE HIS LOVE OR FARE AMISS WHETHER
AWAITED NIGHT AND DAY ON THIS MIRACLE
AND WHEN HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS NONE OBSTACLE
THAT VOIDED WERE THESE ROCKES EVERY ONE REMOVED
DOWN AT HIS MASTER'S FEET HE FELL ANON
AND SAID I WOEFUL WRETCH'D AURELIUS
THANK YOU MY LORD AND LADY MINE VENUS
THAT ME HAVE HOLPEN FROM MY CARES COLD
AND TO THE TEMPLE HIS WAY FORTH HATH HE HOLD
WHERE AS HE KNEW HE SHOULD HIS LADY SEE
AND WHEN HE SAW HIS TIME ANON RIGHT HE
WITH DREADFUL HEART AND WITH FULL HUMBLE CHEER FEARFUL MIEN
SALUTETH HATH HIS SOVEREIGN LADY DEAR
MY RIGHTFUL LADY QUOTH THIS WOEFUL MAN

REPENTE YOU FOR THILKE GOD ABOVE
ERE YE ME SLAY BECAUSE THAT I YOU LOVE
FOR MADAME WELL YE WOT WHAT YE HAVE HIGHT PROMISED
NOT THAT I CHALLENGE ANYTHING OF RIGHT
OF YOU MY SOVEREIGN LADY BUT OF GRACE
BUT IN A GARDEN YOND' IN SUCH A PLACE
YE WOT RIGHT WELL WHAT YE BEHIGHTE ME PROMISED
AND IN MINE HAND YOUR TROTHE PLIGHTED YE
TO LOVE ME BEST GOD WOT YE SAIDE SO
ALBEIT THAT I UNWORTHY AM THERETO
MADAME I SPEAK IT FOR TH' HONOUR OF YOU
MORE THAN TO SAVE MY HEARTE'S LIFE RIGHT NOW

DO AS YOU LIST HAVE YOUR BEHEST IN MIND
FOR QUICK OR DEAD RIGHT THERE YE SHALL ME FIND
IN YOU HES ALL TO DO ME LIVE OR DEY CAUSE ME TO
BUT WELL I WOT THE ROCKES BE AWAY LIVE OR DIE
HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND SHE ASTONISH'D STOOD
IN ALL HER FACE WAS NOT ONE DROP OF BLOOD
SHE NEVER WEEN'D T'HAVE COME IN SUCH A TRAP
ALAS QUOTH SHE THAT EVER THIS SHOULD HAP
FOR WEEN'D I NE'ER BY POSSIBILITY
THAT SUCH A MONSTER OR MARVAIL MIGHT BE
IT IS AGAINST THE PROCESS OF NATURE
AND HOME SHE WENT A SORROWFUL CREATURE
FOR VERY FEAR UNNETHES MAY SHE GO
SCARCELY
SHE WEEPED WAILED ALL A DAY OR TWO
AND SWOONED THAT IT RUTHE WAS TO SEE
BUT WHY IT WAS TO NO WIGHT TOLDE SHE
FOR OUT OF TOWN WAS GONE ARVIRAGUS
BUT TO HERSELF SHE SPAKE AND SAIDE THUS
WITH FACE PALE AND FULL SORROWFUL CHEER
IN HER COMPLAINT AS YE SHALL AFTER HEAR
ALAS QUOTH SHE ON THEE FORTUNE I PLAIN COMPLAIN
THAT UNWARE HAST ME WRAPPED IN THY CHAIN
FROM WHICH TO SCAPE WOT I NO SUCCOUR
SAVE ONLY DEATH OR ELLES DISHONOUR
ONE OF THESE TWO BEHOVETH ME TO CHOOSE
BUT NATHELESS YET HAD I LEVER LOSE SOONER RATHER
MY LIFE THAN OF MY BODY HAVE SHAME
OR KNOW MYSELFE FALSE OR LOSE MY NAME
AND WITH MY DEATH I MAY BE QUIT Y WIS I MAY CERTAINLY PURCHASE
HATH THERE NOT MANY A NOBLE WIFE ERE THIS MY EXEMPTION
AND MANY A MAIDEN SLAIN HERSELF ALAS
RATHER THAN WITH HER BODY DO TRESPASS
YES CERTES LO THESE STORIES BEAR WITNESS
22
WHEN THIRTY TYRANTS FULL OF CURSEDNESS WICKEDNESS
HAD SLAIN PHIDON IN ATHENS AT THE FEAST
THEY COMMANDED HIS DAUGHTERS TO ARREST
AND BRINGE THEM BEFORE THEM IN DESPITE
ALL NAKED TO FULFIL THEIR FOUL DELIGHT
AND IN THEIR FATHER'S BLOOD THEY MADE THEM DANCE
UPON THE PAVEMENT GOD GIVE THEM MISCHANCE
FOR WHICH THESE WOEFUL MAIDENS FULL OF DREAD
RATHER THAN THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR MAIDENHEAD
THEY PRIVILY BE START INTO A WELL SUDDENLY LEAPED
AND DROWNED THEMSELVES AS THE BOOKES TELL
THEY OF MESSENE LET INQUIRE AND SEEK
OF LACEDAEMON FIFTY MAIDENS EKE
ON WHICH THEY WOULDE DO THEIR LECHERY
BUT THERE WAS NONE OF ALL THAT COMPANY
THAT WAS NOT SLAIN AND WITH A GLAD INTENT
CHOSE RATHER FOR TO DIE THAN TO ASSENT
TO BE OPPRESSED OF HER MAIDENHEAD
FORCIBLY BEREFT
WHY SHOULD I THEN TO DIEN BE IN DREAD
LO EKE THE TYRANT ARISTOCLIDES
THAT LOV'D A MAIDEN HIGHT STIMPHALIDES
WHEN THAT HER FATHER SLAIN WAS ON A NIGHT
UNTO DIANA'S TEMPLE WENT SHE RIGHT
AND HENT THE IMAGE IN HER HANDES TWO CAUGHT CLASPED
FROM WHICH IMAGE SHE WOULDE NEVER GO
NO WIGHT HER HANDES MIGHT OFF IT ARACE PLUCK AWAY BY FORCE
TILL SHE WAS SLAIN RIGHT IN THE SELFE PLACE
SAME
NOW SINCE THAT MAIDENS HADDE SUCH DESPITE
TO BE DEFOULED WITH MAN'S FOUL DELIGHT
WELL OUGHT A WIFE RATHER HERSELF TO SLE SLAY
THAN BE DEFOULED AS IT THINKETH ME
WHAT SHALL I SAY OF HASDRUBALE'S WIFE
THAT AT CARTHAGE BEREFT HERSELF OF LIFE
FOR WHEN SHE SAW THE ROMANS WIN THE TOWN
SHE TOOK HER CHILDREN ALL AND SKIPT ADOWN
INTO THE FIRE AND RATHER CHOSE TO DIE
THAN ANY ROMAN DID HER VILLAINY
HATH NOT LUCRETIA SLAIN HERSELF ALAS
AT ROME WHEN THAT SHE OPPRESSED WAS RAVISHED
OF TARQUIN FOR HER THOUGHT IT WAS A SHAME
TO LIVE WHEN SHE HADDE LOST HER NAME
THE SEVEN MAIDENS OF MILESIE ALSO
HAVE SLAIN THEMSELVES FOR VERY DREAD AND WOE
RATHER THAN FOLK OF GAUL THEM SHOULD OPPRESS
MORE THAN A THOUSAND STORIES AS I GUESS
COULD I NOW TELL AS TOUCHING THIS MATTERE
WHEN ABRADATE WAS SLAIN HIS WIFE SO DEAR 23
HERSELFE SLEW AND LET HER BLOOD TO GLIDE
IN ABRADATE'S WOUNDES DEEP AND WIDE
AND SAID 'MY BODY AT THE LEASTE WAY
THERE SHALL NO WIGHT DEFOUL IF THAT I MAY
WHY SHOULD I MORE EXAMPLES HEREOF SAYN
SINCE THAT SO MANY HAVE THEMSELVES SLAIN
WELL RATHER THAN THEY WOULD DEFOULED BE
I WILL CONCLUDE THAT IT IS BET FOR ME BETTER
TO SLAY MYSELF THAN BE DEFOULED THUS
I WILL BE TRUE UNTO ARVIRAGUS
OR ELLES SLAY MYSELF IN SOME MANNERE
AS DID DEMOTIONE'S DAUGHTER DEAR
BECAUSE SHE WOULDE NOT DEFOULED BE
O SEDASUS IT IS FULL GREAT PITY
TO READE HOW THY DAUGHTERS DIED ALAS
THAT SLEW THEMSELVES FOR SUCHE MANNER CAS IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF
AS GREAT A PITY WAS IT OR WELL MORE THE SAME KIND
THE THEBAN MAIDEN THAT FOR NICANOR
HERSELFE SLEW RIGHT FOR SUCH MANNER WOE
ANOTHER THEBAN MAIDEN DID RIGHT SO
FOR ONE OF MACEDON HAD HER OPPRESS'D
SHE WITH HER DEATH HER MAIDENHEAD REDRESS'D VINDICATED
WHAT SHALL I SAY OF NICERATUS' WIFE
THAT FOR SUCH CASE BEREFT HERSELF HER LIFE
HOW TRUE WAS EKE TO ALCIBIADES
HIS LOVE THAT FOR TO DIEN RATHER CHESE CHOSE
THAN FOR TO SUFFER HIS BODY UNBURIED BE
LO WHAT A WIFE WAS ALCESTE QUOTH SHE
WHAT SAITH HOMER OF GOOD PENELOPE
ALL GREECE KNOWETH OF HER CHASTITY
PARDIE OF LAEDAMIA IS WRITTEN THUS
THAT WHEN AT TROY WAS SLAIN PROTESILAUS 24
NO LONGER WOULD SHE LIVE AFTER HIS DAY
THE SAME OF NOBLE PORCIA TELL I MAY
WITHOUTE BRUTUS COULDE SHE NOT LIVE
TO WHOM SHE DID ALL WHOLE HER HEARTE GIVE
25
THE PERFECT WIFEHOOD OF ARTEMISIE 26
HONOURED IS THROUGHOUT ALL BARBARIE
O TEUTA 27 QUEEN THY WIFELY CHASTITY
TO ALLE WIVES MAY A MIRROR BE 28
THUS PLAINED DORIGEN A DAY OR TWAY
PURPOSING EVER THAT SHE WOULDE DEY DIE

CONSIDERING THE BEST ON EVERY SIDE

THAN DO SO HIGH A CHURLISH WRETCHEDNESS WICKEDNESS
AGAINST FRANCHISE AND ALLE GENTLENESS GENEROSITY
FOR WHICH IN FEWE WORDS HE SAIDE THUS
MADAME SAY TO YOUR LORD ARVIRAGUS
THAT SINCE I SEE THE GREATE GENTLENESS
OF HIM AND EKE I SEE WELL YOUR DISTRESS
THAT HIM WERE LEVER HAVE SHAME AND THAT WERE RUTH RATHER PITY
THAN YE TO ME SHOULD BREAKE THUS YOUR TRUTH

THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE PROLOGUE IS QUESTIONABLE
IT IS FOUND IN
ONE MANUSCRIPT ONLY OTHER MANUSCRIPTS GIVE OTHER PROLOGUES
MORE PLAINLY NOT CHAUCER'S THAN THIS AND SOME MANUSCRIPTS
HAVE MERELY A COLOPHON TO THE EFFECT THAT HERE ENDETH THE
FRANKLIN'S TALE AND BEGINNETH THE PHYSICIAN'S TALE WITHOUT A
PROLOGUE THE TALE ITSELF IS THE WELL KNOWN STORY OF VIRGINIA
WITH SEVERAL DEPARTURES FROM THE TEXT OF LIVY
CHAUCER PROBABLY
FOLLOWED THE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE AND GOWER'S CONFESSIO
AMANTIS IN BOTH OF WHICH THE STORY IS FOUND
THE TALE
THERE WAS AS TELLETH TITUS LIVIUS 1
A KNIGHT THAT CALLED WAS VIRGINIUS
FULL FILLED OF HONOUR AND WORTHINESS
AND STRONG OF FRIENDES AND OF GREAT RICHESS
THIS KNIGHT ONE DAUGHTER HADDE BY HIS WIFE
NO CHILDREN HAD HE MORE IN ALL HIS LIFE
FAIR WAS THIS MAID IN EXCELLENT BEAUTY
ABOVEN EV'RY WIGHT THAT MAN MAY SEE
FOR NATURE HAD WITH SOV'REIGN DILIGENCE
Y FORMED HER IN SO GREAT EXCELLENCE
AS THOUGH SHE WOULDE SAY LO I NATURE
THUS CAN I FORM AND PAINT A CREATURE
WHEN THAT ME LIST WHO CAN ME COUNTERFEIT
PYGMALION NOT THOUGH HE AYE FORGE AND BEAT
OR GRAVE OR PAINTE FOR I DARE WELL SAYN
APELLES ZEUXIS SHOULDE WORK IN VAIN
EITHER TO GRAVE OR PAINT OR FORGE OR BEAT
IF THEY PRESUMED ME TO COUNTERFEIT
FOR HE THAT IS THE FORMER PRINCIPAL
HATH MADE ME HIS VICAR GENERAL
TO FORM AND PAINTEN EARTHLY CREATURES
RIGHT AS ME LIST AND ALL THING IN MY CURE IS CARE
UNDER THE MOONE THAT MAY WANE AND WAX
AND FOR MY WORK RIGHT NOTHING WILL I AX ASK
MY LORD AND I BE FULL OF ONE ACCORD
I MADE HER TO THE WORSHIP OF MY LORD
SO DO I ALL MINE OTHER CREATURES
WHAT COLOUR THAT THEY HAVE OR WHAT FIGURES
THUS SEEMETH ME THAT NATURE WOULDE SAY
THIS MAIDEN WAS OF AGE TWELVE YEAR AND TWAY TWO
IN WHICH THAT NATURE HADDE SUCH DELIGHT
FOR RIGHT AS SHE CAN PAINT A LILY WHITE
AND RED A ROSE RIGHT WITH SUCH PAINTURE
SHE PAINTED HAD THIS NOBLE CREATURE
ERE SHE WAS BORN UPON HER LIMBES FREE
WHERE AS BY RIGHT SUCH COLOURS SHOULDE BE
AND PHOEBUS DYED HAD HER TRESSES GREAT
LIKE TO THE STREAMES OF HIS BURNED HEAT
BEAMS RAYS
AND IF THAT EXCELLENT WAS HER BEAUTY
A THOUSAND FOLD MORE VIRTUOUS WAS SHE
IN HER THERE LACKED NO CONDITION
THAT IS TO PRAISE AS BY DISCRETION
AS WELL IN GHOST AS BODY CHASTE WAS SHE MIND SPIRIT
FOR WHICH SHE FLOWER'D IN VIRGINITY
WITH ALL HUMILITY AND ABSTINENCE
WITH ALLE TEMPERANCE AND PATIENCE
WITH MEASURE EKE OF BEARING AND ARRAY
MODERATION
DISCREET SHE WAS IN ANSWERING ALWAY
THOUGH SHE WERE WISE AS PALLAS DARE I SAYN
HER FACONDE EKE FULL WOMANLY AND PLAIN SPEECH 2
NO COUNTERFEITED TERMES HADDE SHE
TO SEEME WISE BUT AFTER HER DEGREE
SHE SPAKE AND ALL HER WORDE'S MORE AND LESS
SOUNDING IN VIRTUE AND IN GENTLENESS
SHAMEFAST SHE WAS IN MAIDEN'S SHAMEFASTNESS
CONSTANT IN HEART AND EVER IN BUSINESS DILIGENT EAGER
TO DRIVE HER OUT OF IDLE SLUGGARDY
BACCHUS HAD OF HER MOUTH RIGHT NO MAST'RY
FOR WINE AND SLOTHE 3 DO VENUS INCREASE
AS MEN IN FIRE WILL CASTEN OIL AND GREASE
AND OF HER OWEN VIRTUE UNCONSTRAIN'D
SHE HAD HERSELF FULL OFTEN SICK Y FEIGN'D
FOR THAT SHE WOULDE FLEE THE COMPANY
WHERE LIKELY WAS TO TREATEN OF FOLLY
AS IS AT FEASTS AT REVELS AND AT DANCES
THAT BE OCCASIONS OF DALLIANCES
SUCH THINGES MAKE CHILDREN FOR TO BE
TOO SOONE RIPE AND BOLD AS MEN MAY SEE
WHICH IS FULL PERILOUS AND HATH BEEN YORE OF OLD
FOR ALL TOO SOONE MAY SHE LEARNE LORE
OF BOLDENESS WHEN THAT SHE IS A WIFE
AND YE MISTRESSES IN YOUR OLDE LIFE GOVERNESSES DUENNAS
THAT LORDES' DAUGHTERS HAVE IN GOVERNANCE
TAKE NOT OF MY WORDES DISPLEASANCE
THINKE THAT YE BE SET IN GOVERNINGS
OF LORDES' DAUGHTERS ONLY FOR TWO THINGS
EITHER FOR YE HAVE KEPT YOUR HONESTY
OR ELSE FOR YE HAVE FALLEN IN FRAILTY
AND KNOWE WELL ENOUGH THE OLDE DANCE
AND HAVE FORSAKEN FULLY SUCH MESCHANCE WICKEDNESS 4
FOR EVERMORE THEREFORE FOR CHRISTE'S SAKE
TO TEACH THEM VIRTUE LOOK THAT YE NOT SLAKE BE SLACK FAIL

WHILE THAT THEY BE UNDER YOUR GOVERNANCE
BEWARE THAT BY EXAMPLE OF YOUR LIVING
OR BY YOUR NEGLIGENCE IN CHASTISING
THAT THEY NOT PERISH FOR I DARE WELL SAY
IF THAT THEY DO YE SHALL IT DEAR ABEYE PAY FOR SUFFER FOR
UNDER A SHEPHERD SOFT AND NEGLIGENT
THE WOLF HATH MANY A SHEEP AND LAMB TO RENT
SUFFICE THIS EXAMPLE NOW AS HERE
FOR I MUST TURN AGAIN TO MY MATTERE
THIS MAID OF WHICH I TELL MY TALE EXPRESS
SHE KEPT HERSELF HER NEEDED NO MISTRESS
FOR IN HER LIVING MAIDENS MIGHTE READ
AS IN A BOOK EV'RY GOOD WORD AND DEED
THAT LONGETH TO A MAIDEN VIRTUOUS
SHE WAS SO PRUDENT AND SO BOUNTEOUS
FOR WHICH THE FAME OUT SPRANG ON EVERY SIDE
BOTH OF HER BEAUTY AND HER BOUNTE WIDE GOODNESS
THAT THROUGH THE LAND THEY PRAISED HER EACH ONE
THAT LOVED VIRTUE SAVE ENVY ALONE
THAT SORRY IS OF OTHER MANNE'S WEAL
AND GLAD IS OF HIS SORROW AND UNHEAL MISFORTUNE
THE DOCTOR MAKETH THIS DESCRIPTIOUN

THIS MAIDEN ON A DAY WENT IN THE TOWN
TOWARD A TEMPLE WITH HER MOTHER DEAR
AS IS OF YOUNGE MAIDENS THE MANNERE
NOW WAS THERE THEN A JUSTICE IN THAT TOWN

ANON THE FIEND INTO HIS HEARTE RAN MAN MAY DO
AND TAUGHT HIM SUDDENLY THAT HE BY SLEIGHT
THIS MAIDEN TO HIS PURPOSE WINNE MIGHT
FOR CERTES BY NO FORCE NOR BY NO MEED BRIBE REWARD
HIM THOUGHT HE WAS NOT ABLE FOR TO SPEED
FOR SHE WAS STRONG OF FRIENDES AND EKE SHE
CONFIRMED WAS IN SUCH SOV'REIGN BOUNTE
THAT WELL HE WIST HE MIGHT HER NEVER WIN
AS FOR TO MAKE HER WITH HER BODY SIN
FOR WHICH WITH GREAT DELIBERATIOUN
HE SENT AFTER A CLERK 6 WAS IN THE TOWN
THE WHICH HE KNEW FOR SUBTLE AND FOR BOLD
THIS JUDGE UNTO THIS CLERK HIS TALE TOLD
IN SECRET WISE AND MADE HIM TO ASSURE
HE SHOULDE TELL IT TO NO CREATURE
AND IF HE DID HE SHOULDE LOSE HIS HEAD
AND WHEN ASSENTED WAS THIS CURSED REDE COUNSEL PLOT

HE WENT HIM HOME AND SAT HIM IN HIS HALL
AND LET ANON HIS DEARE DAUGHTER CALL
AND WITH A FACE DEAD AS ASHES COLD
UPON HER HUMBLE FACE HE GAN BEHOLD

ALL WOULD HE FROM HIS PURPOSE NOT CONVERT ALTHOUGH TURN ASIDE
DAUGHTER QUOTH HE VIRGINIA BY NAME

LORDINGS QUOTH HE IN CHURCHE WHEN I PREACH
I PAINE ME TO HAVE AN HAUTEIN SPEECH TAKE PAINS LOUD 2
AND RING IT OUT AS ROUND AS DOTH A BELL
FOR I KNOW ALL BY ROTE THAT I TELL
MY THEME IS ALWAYS ONE AND EVER WAS
RADIX MALORUM EST CUPIDITAS 3
FIRST I PRONOUNCE WHENCE THAT I COME
AND THEN MY BULLES SHEW I ALL AND SOME
OUR LIEGE LORDE'S SEAL ON MY PATENT
THAT SHEW I FIRST MY BODY TO WARRENT FOR THE PROTECTION
THAT NO MAN BE SO HARDY PRIEST NOR CLERK OF MY PERSON
ME TO DISTURB OF CHRISTE'S HOLY WERK
AND AFTER THAT THEN TELL I FORTH MY TALES
BULLES OF POPES AND OF CARDINALES
OF PATRIARCHS AND OF BISHOPS I SHEW
AND IN LATIN I SPEAK A WORDES FEW
TO SAVOUR WITH MY PREDICATION
AND FOR TO STIR MEN TO DEVOTION
THEN SHOW I FORTH MY LONGE CRYSTAL STONES
Y CRAMMED FALL OF CLOUTES AND OF BONES RAGS FRAGMENTS
RELICS THEY BE AS WEENE THEY EACH ONE
AS MY LISTENERS THINK
THEN HAVE I IN LATOUN A SHOULDER BONE BRASS
WHICH THAT WAS OF A HOLY JEWE'S SHEEP
GOOD MEN SAY I TAKE OF MY WORDES KEEP HEED
IF THAT THIS BONE BE WASH'D IN ANY WELL
IF COW OR CALF OR SHEEP OR OXE SWELL
THAT ANY WORM HATH EAT OR WORM Y STUNG
TAKE WATER OF THAT WELL AND WASH HIS TONGUE
AND IT IS WHOLE ANON AND FARTHERMORE
OF POCKES AND OF SCAB AND EVERY SORE
SHALL EVERY SHEEP BE WHOLE THAT OF THIS WELL
DRINKETH A DRAUGHT TAKE KEEP OF THAT I TELL

IF THAT THE GOODMAN THAT THE BEASTES OWETH OWNETH
WILL EVERY WEEK ERE THAT THE COCK HIM CROWETH
FASTING Y DRINKEN OF THIS WELL A DRAUGHT
AS THILKE HOLY JEW OUR ELDERS TAUGHT
HIS BEASTES AND HIS STORE SHALL MULTIPLY
AND SIRS ALSO IT HEALETH JEALOUSY
FOR THOUGH A MAN BE FALL'N IN JEALOUS RAGE
LET MAKE WITH THIS WATER HIS POTTAGE
AND NEVER SHALL HE MORE HIS WIFE MISTRIST MISTRUST
THOUGH HE THE SOOTH OF HER DEFAULTE WIST THOUGH HE TRULY
ALL HAD SHE TAKEN PRIESTES TWO OR THREE
4 KNEW HER SIN
HERE IS A MITTAIN EKE THAT YE MAY SEE GLOVE MITTEN
HE THAT HIS HAND WILL PUT IN THIS MITTAIN
HE SHALL HAVE MULTIPLYING OF HIS GRAIN
WHEN HE HATH SOWEN BE IT WHEAT OR OATS
SO THAT HE OFFER PENCE OR ELLES GROATS
AND MEN AND WOMEN ONE THING WARN I YOU

OR ANY WOMAN BE SHE YOUNG OR OLD
THAT HATH Y MADE HER HUSBAND COKEWOLD CUCKOLD
SUCH FOLK SHALL HAVE NO POWER NOR NO GRACE
TO OFFER TO MY RELICS IN THIS PLACE
AND WHOSO FINDETH HIM OUT OF SUCH BLAME
HE WILL COME UP AND OFFER IN GOD'S NAME
AND I ASSOIL HIM BY THE AUTHORITY ABSOLVE
WHICH THAT BY BULL Y GRANTED WAS TO ME
BY THIS GAUD HAVE I WONNE YEAR BY YEAR JEST TRICK
A HUNDRED MARKS SINCE I WAS PARDONERE
I STANDE LIKE A CLERK IN MY PULPIT
AND WHEN THE LEWED PEOPLE DOWN IS SET IGNORANT
I PREACHE SO AS YE HAVE HEARD BEFORE
AND TELLE THEM A HUNDRED JAPES MORE
JESTS DECEITS
THEN PAIN I ME TO STRETCHE FORTH MY NECK
AND EAST AND WEST UPON THE PEOPLE I BECK
AS DOTH A DOVE SITTING ON A BERN BARN
MY HANDES AND MY TONGUE GO SO YERN BRISKLY
THAT IT IS JOY TO SEE MY BUSINESS
OF AVARICE AND OF SUCH CURSEDNESS WICKEDNESS
IS ALL MY PREACHING FOR TO MAKE THEM FREE
TO GIVE THEIR PENCE AND NAMELY UNTO ME
ESPECIALLY
FOR MINE INTENT IS NOT BUT FOR TO WIN
AND NOTHING FOR CORRECTION OF SIN
I RECKE NEVER WHEN THAT THEY BE BURIED
THOUGH THAT THEIR SOULES GO A BLACKBURIED 5
FOR CERTES MANY A PREDICATION PREACHING IS OFTEN INSPIRED
COMETH OFT TIME OF EVIL INTENTION BY EVIL MOTIVES
SOME FOR PLEASANCE OF FOLK AND FLATTERY
TO BE ADVANCED BY HYPOCRISY
AND SOME FOR VAINGLORY AND SOME FOR HATE
FOR WHEN I DARE NOT OTHERWISE DEBATE
THEN WILL I STING HIM WITH MY TONGUE SMART SHARPLY
IN PREACHING SO THAT HE SHALL NOT ASTART ESCAPE
TO BE DEFAMED FALSELY IF THAT HE
HATH TRESPASS'D TO MY BRETHREN OR TO ME
OFFENDED
FOR THOUGH I TELLE NOT HIS PROPER NAME
MEN SHALL WELL KNOWE THAT IT IS THE SAME
BY SIGNES AND BY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
THUS QUITE I FOLK THAT DO US DISPLEASANCES I AM REVENGED ON
THUS SPIT I OUT MY VENOM UNDER HUE
OF HOLINESS TO SEEM HOLY AND TRUE
BUT SHORTLY MINE INTENT I WILL DEVISE
I PREACH OF NOTHING BUT OF COVETISE
THEREFORE MY THEME IS YET AND EVER WAS
RADIX MALORUM EST CUPIDITAS
3
THUS CAN I PREACH AGAINST THE SAME VICE
WHICH THAT I USE AND THAT IS AVARICE
BUT THOUGH MYSELF BE GUILTY IN THAT SIN
YET CAN I MAKEN OTHER FOLK TO TWIN DEPART
FROM AVARICE AND SORE THEM REPENT
BUT THAT IS NOT MY PRINCIPAL INTENT
I PREACHE NOTHING BUT FOR COVETISE
OF THIS MATTERE IT OUGHT ENOUGH SUFFICE
THEN TELL I THEM EXAMPLES MANY A ONE
OF OLDE STORIES LONGE TIME GONE
FOR LEWED PEOPLE LOVE TALES OLD UNLEARNED
SUCH THINGES CAN THEY WELL REPORT AND HOLD
WHAT TROWE YE THAT WHILES I MAY PREACH
AND WINNE GOLD AND SILVER FOR I TEACH BECAUSE
THAT I WILL LIVE IN POVERT' WILFULLY
NAY NAY I THOUGHT IT NEVER TRUELY
FOR I WILL PREACH AND BEG IN SUNDRY LANDS
I WILL NOT DO NO LABOUR WITH MINE HANDS
NOR MAKE BASKETS FOR TO LIVE THEREBY
BECAUSE I WILL NOT BEGGEN IDLELY
I WILL NONE OF THE APOSTLES COUNTERFEIT IMITATE IN POVERTY
I WILL HAVE MONEY WOOL AND CHEESE AND WHEAT
ALL WERE IT GIVEN OF THE POOREST PAGE EVEN IF
OR OF THE POORESTE WIDOW IN A VILLAGE
ALL SHOULD HER CHILDREN STERVE FOR FAMINE
DIE
NAY I WILL DRINK THE LIQUOR OF THE VINE
AND HAVE A JOLLY WENCH IN EVERY TOWN
BUT HEARKEN LORDINGS IN CONCLUSIOUN
YOUR LIKING IS THAT I SHALL TELL A TALE
NOW I HAVE DRUNK A DRAUGHT OF CORNY ALE
BY GOD I HOPE I SHALL YOU TELL A THING
THAT SHALL BY REASON BE TO YOUR LIKING
FOR THOUGH MYSELF BE A FULL VICIOUS MAN
A MORAL TALE YET I YOU TELLE CAN
WHICH I AM WONT TO PREACHE FOR TO WIN
NOW HOLD YOUR PEACE MY TALE I WILL BEGIN
IN FLANDERS WHILOM WAS A COMPANY
OF YOUNGE FOLKES THAT HAUNTED FOLLY
AS RIOT HAZARD STEWES AND TAVERNS BROTHELS
WHERE AS WITH LUTES HARPES AND GITERNS GUITARS
THEY DANCE AND PLAY AT DICE BOTH DAY AND NIGHT
AND EAT ALSO AND DRINK OVER THEIR MIGHT
THROUGH WHICH THEY DO THE DEVIL SACRIFICE
WITHIN THE DEVIL'S TEMPLE IN CURSED WISE
BY SUPERFLUITY ABOMINABLE
THEIR OATHES BE SO GREAT AND SO DAMNABLE
THAT IT IS GRISLY FOR TO HEAR THEM SWEAR
DREADFUL 6
OUR BLISSFUL LORDE'S BODY THEY TO TEAR TORE TO PIECES 7
THEM THOUGHT THE JEWES RENT HIM NOT ENOUGH
AND EACH OF THEM AT OTHER'S SINNE LOUGH LAUGHED
AND RIGHT ANON IN COME TOMBESTERES 8
FETIS AND SMALL AND YOUNGE FRUITESTERES DAINTY FRUIT GIRLS
SINGERS WITH HARPES BAUDES WAFERERS REVELLERS CAKE SELLERS
WHICH BE THE VERY DEVIL'S OFFICERS
TO KINDLE AND BLOW THE FIRE OF LECHERY
THAT IS ANNEXED UNTO GLUTTONY
THE HOLY WRIT TAKE I TO MY WITNESS
THAT LUXURY IS IN WINE AND DRUNKENNESS
9
LO HOW THAT DRUNKEN LOT UNKINDELY UNNATURALLY
LAY BY HIS DAUGHTERS TWO UNWITTINGLY
SO DRUNK HE WAS HE KNEW NOT WHAT HE WROUGHT
HERODES WHO SO WELL THE STORIES SOUGHT 10
WHEN HE OF WINE REPLETE WAS AT HIS FEAST
RIGHT AT HIS OWEN TABLE GAVE HIS HEST COMMAND
TO SLAY THE BAPTIST JOHN FULL GUILTELESS
SENECA SAITH A GOOD WORD DOUBTELESS
HE SAITH HE CAN NO DIFFERENCE FIND
BETWIXT A MAN THAT IS OUT OF HIS MIND
AND A MAN WHICHE THAT IS DRUNKELEW A DRUNKARD 11
BUT THAT WOODNESS Y FALLEN IN A SHREW MADNESS ONE EVIL TEMPERED
PERSEVERETH LONGER THAN DRUNKENNESS
O GLUTTONY FULL OF ALL CURSEDNESS
O CAUSE FIRST OF OUR CONFUSION
ORIGINAL OF OUR DAMNATION
TILL CHRIST HAD BOUGHT US WITH HIS BLOOD AGAIN
LOOKE HOW DEARE SHORTLY FOR TO SAYN
ABOUGHT WAS FIRST THIS CURSED VILLAINY ATONED FOR
CORRUPT WAS ALL THIS WORLD FOR GLUTTONY
ADAM OUR FATHER AND HIS WIFE ALSO
FROM PARADISE TO LABOUR AND TO WOE
WERE DRIVEN FOR THAT VICE IT IS NO DREAD DOUBT
FOR WHILE THAT ADAM FASTED AS I READ
HE WAS IN PARADISE AND WHEN THAT HE
ATE OF THE FRUIT DEFENDED OF THE TREE FORBIDDEN 12
ANON HE WAS CAST OUT TO WOE AND PAIN
O GLUTTONY WELL OUGHT US ON THEE PLAIN
OH WIST A MAN HOW MANY MALADIES
FOLLOW OF EXCESS AND OF GLUTTONIES
HE WOULDE BE THE MORE MEASURABLE MODERATE
OF HIS DIETE SITTING AT HIS TABLE
ALAS THE SHORTE THROAT THE TENDER MOUTH
MAKETH THAT EAST AND WEST AND NORTH AND SOUTH
IN EARTH IN AIR IN WATER MEN DO SWINK LABOUR
TO GET A GLUTTON DAINTY MEAT AND DRINK
OF THIS MATTERE O PAUL WELL CANST THOU TREAT
MEAT UNTO WOMB AND WOMB EKE UNTO MEAT BELLY
SHALL GOD DESTROYE BOTH AS PAULUS SAITH
13
ALAS A FOUL THING IS IT BY MY FAITH
TO SAY THIS WORD AND FOULER IS THE DEED
WHEN MAN SO DRINKETH OF THE WHITE AND RED I E
WINE
THAT OF HIS THROAT HE MAKETH HIS PRIVY
THROUGH THILKE CURSED SUPERFLUITY
THE APOSTLE SAITH 14 WEEPING FULL PITEOUSLY
THERE WALK MANY OF WHICH YOU TOLD HAVE I
I SAY IT NOW WEEPING WITH PITEOUS VOICE
THAT THEY BE ENEMIES OF CHRISTE'S CROIS CROSS
OF WHICH THE END IS DEATH WOMB IS THEIR GOD
BELLY
O WOMB O BELLY STINKING IS THY COD BAG 15
FULL FILL'D OF DUNG AND OF CORRUPTIOUN
AT EITHER END OF THEE FOUL IS THE SOUN
HOW GREAT LABOUR AND COST IS THEE TO FIND SUPPLY
THESE COOKES HOW THEY STAMP AND STRAIN AND GRIND
AND TURNE SUBSTANCE INTO ACCIDENT
TO FULFILL ALL THY LIKEROUS TALENT
OUT OF THE HARDE BONES KNOCKE THEY
THE MARROW FOR THEY CASTE NAUGHT AWAY
THAT MAY GO THROUGH THE GULLET SOFT AND SWOOT SWEET
OF SPICERY AND LEAVES OF BARK AND ROOT
SHALL BE HIS SAUCE Y MAKED BY DELIGHT
TO MAKE HIM HAVE A NEWER APPETITE
BUT CERTES HE THAT HAUNTETH SUCH DELICES
IS DEAD WHILE THAT HE LIVETH IN THOSE VICES
A LECHEROUS THING IS WINE AND DRUNKENNESS
IS FULL OF STRIVING AND OF WRETCHEDNESS
O DRUNKEN MAN DISFGUR'D IS THY FACE 16
SOUR IS THY BREATH FOUL ART THOU TO EMBRACE
AND THROUGH THY DRUNKEN NOSE SOWNETH THE SOUN'
AS THOUGH THOUS SAIDEST AYE SAMSOUN SAMSOUN
AND YET GOD WOT SAMSON DRANK NEVER WINE
THOU FALLEST AS IT WERE A STICKED SWINE
THY TONGUE IS LOST AND ALL THINE HONEST CURE CARE
FOR DRUNKENNESS IS VERY SEPULTURE TOMB
OF MANNE'S WIT AND HIS DISCRETION
IN WHOM THAT DRINK HATH DOMINATION
HE CAN NO COUNSEL KEEP IT IS NO DREAD DOUBT
NOW KEEP YOU FROM THE WHITE AND FROM THE RED
AND NAMELY FROM THE WHITE WINE OF LEPE 17 ESPECIALLY
THAT IS TO SELL IN FISH STREET 18 AND IN CHEAP
THIS WINE OF SPAINE CREEPETH SUBTILLY
IN OTHER WINES GROWING FASTE BY
OF WHICH THERE RISETH SUCH FUMOSITY
THAT WHEN A MAN HATH DRUNKEN DRAUGHTES THREE
AND WEENETH THAT HE BE AT HOME IN CHEAP
HE IS IN SPAIN RIGHT AT THE TOWN OF LEPE
NOT AT THE ROCHELLE NOR AT BOURDEAUX TOWN
AND THENNE WILL HE SAY SAMSOUN SAMSOUN
BUT HEARKEN LORDINGS ONE WORD I YOU PRAY
THAT ALL THE SOVREIGN ACTES DARE I SAY
OF VICTORIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
THROUGH VERY GOD THAT IS OMNIPOTENT
WERE DONE IN ABSTINENCE AND IN PRAYERE
LOOK IN THE BIBLE AND THERE YE MAY IT LEAR LEARN
LOOK ATTILA THE GREATE CONQUEROR
DIED IN HIS SLEEP 19 WITH SHAME AND DISHONOUR
BLEEDING AYE AT HIS NOSE IN DRUNKENNESS
A CAPTAIN SHOULD AYE LIVE IN SOBERNESS
AND O'ER ALL THIS ADVISE YOU RIGHT WELL CONSIDER BETHINK
WHAT WAS COMMANDED UNTO LEMUEL 20
NOT SAMUEL BUT LEMUEL SAY I
READE THE BIBLE AND FIND IT EXPRESSLY
OF WINE GIVING TO THEM THAT HAVE JUSTICE
NO MORE OF THIS FOR IT MAY WELL SUFFICE
AND NOW THAT I HAVE SPOKE OF GLUTTONY
NOW WILL I YOU DEFENDE HAZARDRY FORBID GAMBLING
HAZARD IS VERY MOTHER OF LEASINGS LIES
AND OF DECEIT AND CURSED FORSWEARINGS
BLASPHEM' OF CHRIST MANSLAUGHTER AND WASTE ALSO
OF CHATTEL AND OF TIME AND FURTHERMO' PROPERTY
IT IS REPREVE AND CONTRAR' OF HONOUR REPROACH
FOR TO BE HELD A COMMON HAZARDOUR
AND EVER THE HIGHER HE IS OF ESTATE
THE MORE HE IS HOLDEN DESOLATE UNDONE WORTHLESS
IF THAT A PRINCE USE HAZARDRY
IN ALLE GOVERNANCE AND POLICY
HE IS AS BY COMMON OPINION
Y HOLD THE LESS IN REPUTATION
CHILON THAT WAS A WISE AMBASSADOR
WAS SENT TO CORINTH WITH FULL GREAT HONOR
FROM LACEDEMON 21 TO MAKE ALLIANCE
AND WHEN HE CAME IT HAPPEN'D HIM BY CHANCE
THAT ALL THE GREATEST THAT WERE OF THAT LAND
Y PLAYING ATTE HAZARD HE THEM FAND FOUND
FOR WHICH AS SOON AS THAT IT MIGHTE BE
HE STOLE HIM HOME AGAIN TO HIS COUNTRY
AND SAIDE THERE I WILL NOT LOSE MY NAME
NOR WILL I TAKE ON ME SO GREAT DIFFAME REPROACH
YOU TO ALLY UNTO NO HAZARDORS GAMBLERS
SENDE SOME OTHER WISE AMBASSADORS
FOR BY MY TROTH ME WERE LEVER DIE RATHER
THAN I SHOULD YOU TO HAZARDORS ALLY
FOR YE THAT BE SO GLORIOUS IN HONOURS
SHALL NOT ALLY YOU TO NO HAZARDOURS
AS BY MY WILL NOR AS BY MY TREATY
THIS WISE PHILOSOPHER THUS SAID HE
LOOK EKE HOW TO THE KING DEMETRIUS
THE KING OF PARTHES AS THE BOOK SAITH US
SENT HIM A PAIR OF DICE OF GOLD IN SCORN
FOR HE HAD USED HAZARD THEREBEFORN
FOR WHICH HE HELD HIS GLORY AND RENOWN
AT NO VALUE OR REPUTATIOUN
LORDES MAY FINDEN OTHER MANNER PLAY
HONEST ENOUGH TO DRIVE THE DAY AWAY
NOW WILL I SPEAK OF OATHES FALSE AND GREAT
A WORD OR TWO AS OLDE BOOKES TREAT
GREAT SWEARING IS A THING ABOMINABLE
AND FALSE SWEARING IS MORE REPROVABLE
THE HIGHE GOD FORBADE SWEARING AT ALL
WITNESS ON MATTHEW 22 BUT IN SPECIAL
OF SWEARING SAITH THE HOLY JEREMIE 23
THOU THALT SWEAR SOOTH THINE OATHES AND NOT LIE
AND SWEAR IN DOOM AND EKE IN RIGHTEOUSNESS JUDGEMENT
BUT IDLE SWEARING IS A CURSEDNESS WICKEDNESS
BEHOLD AND SEE THERE IN THE FIRSTE TABLE
OF HIGHE GODDE'S HESTES HONOURABLE COMMANDMENTS
HOW THAT THE SECOND BEST OF HIM IS THIS
TAKE NOT MY NAME IN IDLE OR AMISS
IN VAIN
LO RATHER HE FORBIDDETH SUCH SWEARING SOONER
THAN HOMICIDE OR MANY A CURSED THING
I SAY THAT AS BY ORDER THUS IT STANDETH
THIS KNOWETH HE THAT HIS HESTS UNDERSTANDETH COMMANDMENTS
HOW THAT THE SECOND HEST OF GOD IS THAT
AND FARTHERMORE I WILL THEE TELL ALL PLAT FLATLY PLAINLY
THAT VENGEANCE SHALL NOT PARTE FROM HIS HOUSE
THAT OF HIS OATHES IS OUTRAGEOUS
BY GODDE'S PRECIOUS HEART AND BY HIS NAILS 24
AND BY THE BLOOD OF CHRIST THAT IS IN HAILES 25
SEVEN IS MY CHANCE AND THINE IS CINQUE AND TREY
BY GODDE'S ARMES IF THOU FALSELY PLAY
THIS DAGGER SHALL THROUGHOUT THINE HEARTE GO
THIS FRUIT COMES OF THE BICCHED BONES TWO TWO CURSED BONES DICE
FORSWEARING IRE FALSENESS AND HOMICIDE
NOW FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST THAT FOR US DIED
LEAVE YOUR OATHES BOTHE GREAT AND SMALE
BUT SIRS NOW WILL I ELL YOU FORTH MY TALE
THESE RIOTOURES THREE OF WHICH I TELL
LONG ERST THAN PRIME RANG OF ANY BELL BEFORE
WERE SET THEM IN A TAVERN FOR TO DRINK

YEA GODDE'S ARMES QUOTH THIS RIOTOUR

I SHALL HIM SEEK BY STILE AND EKE BY STREET
I MAKE A VOW BY GODDE'S DIGNE BONES WORTHY
HEARKEN FELLOWS WE THREE BE ALLE ONES AT ONE
LET EACH OF US HOLD UP HIS HAND TO OTHER
AND EACH OF US BECOME THE OTHER'S BROTHER
AND WE WILL SLAY THIS FALSE TRAITOR DEATH

BY GODDE'S DIGNITY ERE IT BE NIGHT
TOGETHER HAVE THESE THREE THEIR TROTHE PLIGHT
TO LIVE AND DIE EACH ONE OF THEM FOR OTHER
AS THOUGH HE WERE HIS OWEN SWOREN BROTHER
AND UP THEY START ALL DRUNKEN IN THIS RAGE
AND FORTH THEY GO TOWARDES THAT VILLAGE
OF WHICH THE TAVERNER HAD SPOKE BEFORN
AND MANY A GRISLY OATHE HAVE THEY SWORN DREADFUL
AND CHRISTE'S BLESSED BODY THEY TO RENT TORE TO PIECES 7
DEATH SHALL BE DEAD IF THAT WE MAY HIM HENT CATCH
WHEN THEY HAD GONE NOT FULLY HALF A MILE
RIGHT AS THEY WOULD HAVE TRODDEN O'ER A STILE
AN OLD MAN AND A POORE WITH THEM MET

NEITHER IN CITY NOR IN NO VILLAGE GO
THAT WOULDE CHANGE HIS YOUTHE FOR MINE AGE
AND THEREFORE MUST I HAVE MINE AGE STILL
AS LONGE TIME AS IT IS GODDE'S WILL

THUS WALK I LIKE A RESTELESS CAITIFE MISERABLE WRETCH
AND ON THE GROUND WHICH IS MY MOTHER'S GATE

THAT BY MY TRUTH I WILL THEE NOT BEWRAY BETRAY
NOW QUOTH THE FIRST THOU KNOW'ST WELL WE BE TWAY
AND TWO OF US SHALL STRONGER BE THAN ONE
LOOK WHEN THAT HE IS SET THOU RIGHT ANON SAT DOWN
ARISE AS THOUGH THOU WOULDEST WITH HIM PLAY
AND I SHALL RIVE HIM THROUGH THE SIDES TWAY STAB
WHILE THAT THOU STRUGGLEST WITH HIM AS IN GAME
AND WITH THY DAGGER LOOK THOU DO THE SAME
AND THEN SHALL ALL THIS GOLD DEPARTED BE DIVIDED
MY DEARE FRIEND BETWIXTE THEE AND ME
THEN MAY WE BOTH OUR LUSTES ALL FULFIL PLEASURES
AND PLAY AT DICE RIGHT AT OUR OWEN WILL
AND THUS ACCORDED BE THESE SHREWES TWAY AGREED WRETCHES
TO SLAY THE THIRD AS YE HAVE HEARD ME SAY
THE YOUNGEST WHICH THAT WENTE TO THE TOWN
FULL OFT IN HEART HE ROLLED UP AND DOWN
THE BEAUTY OF THESE FLORINS NEW AND BRIGHT
O LORD QUOTH HE IF SO WERE THAT I MIGHT
HAVE ALL THIS TREASURE TO MYSELF ALONE
THERE IS NO MAN THAT LIVES UNDER THE THRONE
OF GOD THAT SHOULDE HAVE SO MERRY AS I
AND AT THE LAST THE FIEND OUR ENEMY
PUT IN HIS THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD POISON BUY
WITH WHICH HE MIGHTE SLAY HIS FELLOWS TWY TWO
FOR WHY THE FIEND FOUND HIM IN SUCH LIVING LEADING SUCH A
THAT HE HAD LEAVE TO SORROW HIM TO BRING
BAD LIFE
FOR THIS WAS UTTERLY HIS FULL INTENT
TO SLAY THEM BOTH AND NEVER TO REPENT
AND FORTH HE WENT NO LONGER WOULD HE TARRY
INTO THE TOWN TO AN APOTHECARY
AND PRAYED HIM THAT HE HIM WOULDE SELL
SOME POISON THAT HE MIGHT HIS RATTES QUELL KILL HIS RATS
AND EKE THERE WAS A POLECAT IN HIS HAW FARM YARD HEDGE 27
THAT AS HE SAID HIS EAPONS HAD Y SLAW SLAIN
AND FAIN HE WOULD HIM WREAK IF THAT HE MIGHT REVENGE
OF VERMIN THAT DESTROYED HIM BY NIGHT
TH'APOTHECARY ANSWER'D THOU SHALT HAVE
A THING AS WISLY GOD MY SOULE SAVE SURELY
IN ALL THIS WORLD THERE IS NO CREATURE
THAT EAT OR DRANK HATH OF THIS CONFECTURE
NOT BUT THE MOUNTANCE OF A CORN OF WHEAT AMOUNT
THAT HE SHALL NOT HIS LIFE ANON FORLETE IMMEDIATELY LAY DOWN
YEA STERVE HE SHALL AND THAT IN LESSE WHILE DIE
THAN THOU WILT GO APACE NOUGHT BUT A MILE QUICKLY
THIS POISON IS SO STRONG AND VIOLENT
THIS CURSED MAN HATH IN HIS HAND Y HENT TAKEN
THIS POISON IN A BOX AND SWIFT HE RAN
INTO THE NEXTE STREET UNTO A MAN
AND BORROW'D OF HIM LARGE BOTTLES THREE
AND IN THE TWO THE POISON POURED HE
THE THIRD HE KEPTE CLEAN FOR HIS OWN DRINK
FOR ALL THE NIGHT HE SHOPE HIM FOR TO SWINK PURPOSED LABOUR
IN CARRYING OFF THE GOLD OUT OF THAT PLACE
AND WHEN THIS RIOTOUR WITH SORRY GRACE
HAD FILL'D WITH WINE HIS GREATE BOTTLES THREE
TO HIS FELLOWS AGAIN REPAIRED HE
WHAT NEEDETH IT THEREOF TO SERMON MORE TALK DISCOURSE
FOR RIGHT AS THEY HAD CAST HIS DEATH BEFORE PLOTTED
RIGHT SO THEY HAVE HIM SLAIN AND THAT ANON
AND WHEN THAT THIS WAS DONE THUS SPAKE THE ONE
NOW LET US SIT AND DRINK AND MAKE US MERRY
AND AFTERWARD WE WILL HIS BODY BURY
AND WITH THAT WORD IT HAPPEN'D HIM PAR CAS BY CHANCE
TO TAKE THE BOTTLE WHERE THE POISON WAS
AND DRANK AND GAVE HIS FELLOW DRINK ALSO
FOR WHICH ANON THEY STERVED BOTH THE TWO
DIED
BUT CERTES I SUPPOSE THAT AVICEN
WROTE NEVER IN NO CANON NOR NO FEN 28
MORE WONDROUS SIGNES OF EMPOISONING
THAN HAD THESE WRETCHES TWO ERE THEIR ENDING
THUS ENDED BE THESE HOMICIDES TWO
AND EKE THE FALSE EMPOISONER ALSO
O CURSED SIN FULL OF ALL CURSEDNESS
O TRAIT'ROUS HOMICIDE O WICKEDNESS
O GLUTT'NY LUXURY AND HAZARDRY
THOU BLASPHEMER OF CHRIST WITH VILLANY OUTRAGE IMPIETY
AND OATHES GREAT OF USAGE AND OF PRIDE
ALAS MANKINDE HOW MAY IT BETIDE
THAT TO THY CREATOR WHICH THAT THEE WROUGHT
AND WITH HIS PRECIOUS HEARTE BLOOD THEE BOUGHT
THOU ART SO FALSE AND SO UNKIND ALAS UNNATURAL
NOW GOOD MEN GOD FORGIVE YOU YOUR TRESPASS
AND WARE YOU FROM THE SIN OF AVARICE
KEEP
MINE HOLY PARDON MAY YOU ALL WARICE HEAL
SO THAT YE OFFER NOBLES OR STERLINGS GOLD OR SILVER COINS
OR ELLES SILVER BROOCHES SPOONS OR RINGS
BOWE YOUR HEAD UNDER THIS HOLY BULL

INTO THE BLISS OF HEAVEN SHALL YE GON
I YOU ASSOIL BY MINE HIGH POWERE ABSOLVE 29
YOU THAT WILL OFFER AS CLEAN AND EKE AS CLEAR
AS YE WERE BORN
LO SIRES THUS I PREACH
AND JESUS CHRIST THAT IS OUR SOULES' LEECH HEALER
SO GRANTE YOU HIS PARDON TO RECEIVE
FOR THAT IS BEST I WILL NOT DECEIVE
BUT SIRS ONE WORD FORGOT I IN MY TALE
I HAVE RELICS AND PARDON IN MY MAIL

WHICH WERE ME GIVEN BY THE POPE'S HAND
IF ANY OF YOU WILL OF DEVOTION
OFFER AND HAVE MINE ABSOLUTION
COME FORTH ANON AND KNEELE HERE ADOWN
AND MEEKELY RECEIVE MY PARDOUN
OR ELLES TAKE PARDON AS YE WEND GO
ALL NEW AND FRESH AT EVERY TOWNE'S END
SO THAT YE OFFER ALWAYS NEW AND NEW
NOBLES OR PENCE WHICH THAT BE GOOD AND TRUE
'TIS AN HONOUR TO EVEREACH THAT IS HERE EACH ONE

T'ASSOILE YOU IN COUNTRY AS YE RIDE ABSOLVE
FOR AVENTURES WHICH THAT MAY BETIDE
PARAVENTURE THERE MAY FALL ONE OR TWO
DOWN OF HIS HORSE AND BREAK HIS NECK IN TWO
LOOK WHAT A SURETY IS IT TO YOU ALL
THAT I AM IN YOUR FELLOWSHIP Y FALL
THAT MAY ASSOIL YOU BOTHE MORE AND LASS ABSOLVE
WHEN THAT THE SOUL SHALL FROM THE BODY PASS
GREAT AND SMALL
I REDE THAT OUR HOSTE SHALL BEGIN ADVISE
FOR HE IS MOST ENVELOPED IN SIN
COME FORTH SIR HOST AND OFFER FIRST ANON
AND THOU SHALT KISS THE RELICS EVERY ONE
YEA FOR A GROAT UNBUCKLE ANON THY PURSE
NAY NAY QUOTH HE THEN HAVE I CHRISTE'S CURSE
LET BE QUOTH HE IT SHALL NOT BE SO THE'CH SO MAY I THRIVE
THOU WOULDEST MAKE ME KISS THINE OLDE BREECH
AND SWEAR IT WERE A RELIC OF A SAINT
THOUGH IT WERE WITH THY FUNDAMENT DEPAINT' STAINED BY YOUR BOTTOM
BUT BY THE CROSS WHICH THAT SAINT HELEN FAND FOUND 30
I WOULD I HAD THY COILONS IN MINE HAND TESTICLES
INSTEAD OF RELICS OR OF SANCTUARY
LET CUT THEM OFF I WILL THEE HELP THEM CARRY
THEY SHALL BE SHRINED IN A HOGGE'S TURD
THE PARDONER ANSWERED NOT ONE WORD
SO WROTH HE WAS NO WORDE WOULD HE SAY
NOW QUOTH OUR HOST I WILL NO LONGER PLAY
WITH THEE NOR WITH NONE OTHER ANGRY MAN
BUT RIGHT ANON THE WORTHY KNIGHT BEGAN
WHEN THAT HE SAW THAT ALL THE PEOPLE LOUGH LAUGHED
NO MORE OF THIS FOR IT IS RIGHT ENOUGH
SIR PARDONER BE MERRY AND GLAD OF CHEER
AND YE SIR HOST THAT BE TO ME SO DEAR
I PRAY YOU THAT YE KISS THE PARDONER
AND PARDONER I PRAY THEE DRAW THEE NER NEARER
AND AS WE DIDDE LET US LAUGH AND PLAY
ANON THEY KISS'D AND RODE FORTH THEIR WAY

THAT RICHE WAS FOR WHICH MEN HELD HIM WISE
A WIFE HE HAD OF EXCELLENT BEAUTY

THERE WAS IN ASIA IN A GREAT CITY
AMONGES CHRISTIAN FOLK A JEWERY 5
SUSTAINED BY A LORD OF THAT COUNTRY
FOR FOUL USURE AND LUCRE OF VILLAINY
HATEFUL TO CHRIST AND TO HIS COMPANY
AND THROUGH THE STREET MEN MIGHTE RIDE AND WEND GO WALK
FOR IT WAS FREE AND OPEN AT EACH END
A LITTLE SCHOOL OF CHRISTIAN FOLK THERE STOOD
DOWN AT THE FARTHER END IN WHICH THERE WERE
CHILDREN AN HEAP Y COME OF CHRISTIAN BLOOD
THAT LEARNED IN THAT SCHOOLE YEAR BY YEAR
SUCH MANNER DOCTRINE AS MEN USED THERE
THIS IS TO SAY TO SINGEN AND TO READ
AS SMALLE CHILDREN DO IN THEIR CHILDHEAD
AMONG THESE CHILDREN WAS A WIDOW'S SON
A LITTLE CLERGION SEVEN YEAR OF AGE YOUNG CLERK OR SCHOLAR

THAT SUCH A BOY SHALL WALKEN AS HIM LEST
IN YOUR DESPITE AND SING OF SUCH SENTENCE
WHICH IS AGAINST YOUR LAWE'S REVERENCE
FROM THENCEFORTH THE JEWES HAVE CONSPIRED
THIS INNOCENT OUT OF THE WORLD TO CHASE

GOD SHIELD HIS CORSE FROM SHAND BODY HARM
AND FOR HE WAS A KNIGHT AUNTROUS ADVENTUROUS

NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO CHAUCER'S TALE OF MELIBOEUS
1
CHAUCER CROWNS THE SATIRE ON THE ROMANTICISTS BY MAKING THE
VERY LANDLORD OF THE TABARD CRY OUT IN INDIGNANT DISGUST AGAINST
THE STUFF WHICH HE HAD HEARD RECITED THE GOOD HOST ASCRIBING
TO SHEER IGNORANCE THE STRING OF POMPOUS PLATITUDES AND PROSAIC
DETAILS WHICH CHAUCER HAD UTTERED
2
DRAFTY WORTHLESS VILE NO BETTER THAN DRAFF OR DREGS FROM
THE ANGLO SAXON DRIFAN TO DRIVE AWAY EXPEL
THE TALE 1
A YOUNG MAN CALLED MELIBOEUS MIGHTY AND RICH BEGAT UPON HIS
WIFE THAT CALLED WAS PRUDENCE A DAUGHTER WHICH THAT CALLED WAS
SOPHIA
UPON A DAY BEFELL THAT HE FOR HIS DISPORT WENT INTO THE
FIELDS HIM TO PLAY
HIS WIFE AND EKE HIS DAUGHTER HATH HE LEFT
WITHIN HIS HOUSE OF WHICH THE DOORS WERE FAST SHUT
THREE OF HIS
OLD FOES HAVE IT ESPIED AND SET LADDERS TO THE WALLS OF HIS HOUSE
AND BY THE WINDOWS BE ENTERED AND BEATEN HIS WIFE AND
WOUNDED HIS DAUGHTER WITH FIVE MORTAL WOUNDS IN FIVE SUNDRY
PLACES THAT IS TO SAY IN HER FEET IN HER HANDS IN HER EARS IN HER
NOSE AND IN HER MOUTH AND LEFT HER FOR DEAD AND WENT AWAY
WHEN MELIBOEUS RETURNED WAS INTO HIS HOUSE AND SAW ALL THIS
MISCHIEF HE LIKE A MAN MAD RENDING HIS CLOTHES GAN WEEP AND
CRY
PRUDENCE HIS WIFE AS FARFORTH AS SHE DURST BESOUGHT HIM OF
HIS WEEPING FOR TO STINT BUT NOT FORTHY NOTWITHSTANDING HE GAN
TO WEEP AND CRY EVER LONGER THE MORE
THIS NOBLE WIFE PRUDENCE REMEMBERED HER UPON THE SENTENCE OF
OVID IN HIS BOOK THAT CALLED IS THE REMEDY OF LOVE 2
WHERE HE SAITH HE IS A FOOL THAT DISTURBETH THE MOTHER TO WEEP
IN THE DEATH OF HER CHILD TILL SHE HAVE WEPT HER FILL AS FOR A
CERTAIN TIME AND THEN SHALL A MAN DO HIS DILIGENCE WITH AMIABLE
WORDS HER TO RECOMFORT AND PRAY HER OF HER WEEPING FOR TO STINT
CEASE
FOR WHICH REASON THIS NOBLE WIFE PRUDENCE SUFFERED HER
HUSBAND FOR TO WEEP AND CRY AS FOR A CERTAIN SPACE AND WHEN
SHE SAW HER TIME SHE SAID TO HIM IN THIS WISE ALAS MY LORD
QUOTH SHE WHY MAKE YE YOURSELF FOR TO BE LIKE A FOOL FOR
SOOTH IT APPERTAINETH NOT TO A WISE MAN TO MAKE SUCH A SORROW
YOUR DAUGHTER WITH THE GRACE OF GOD SHALL WARISH BE CURED
AND ESCAPE
AND ALL ALTHOUGH WERE IT SO THAT SHE RIGHT NOW
WERE DEAD YE OUGHT NOT FOR HER DEATH YOURSELF TO DESTROY
SENECA SAITH 'THE WISE MAN SHALL NOT TAKE TOO GREAT DISCOMFORT
FOR THE DEATH OF HIS CHILDREN BUT CERTES HE SHOULD SUFFER IT IN
PATIENCE AS WELL AS HE ABIDETH THE DEATH OF HIS OWN PROPER
PERSON
MELIBOEUS ANSWERED ANON AND SAID WHAT MAN QUOTH HE
SHOULD OF HIS WEEPING STINT THAT HATH SO GREAT A CAUSE TO WEEP
JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD HIMSELF WEPT FOR THE DEATH OF LAZARUS
HIS FRIEND PRUDENCE ANSWERED CERTES WELL I WOT
ATTEMPERED MODERATE WEEPING IS NOTHING DEFENDED FORBIDDEN
TO HIM THAT SORROWFUL IS AMONG FOLK IN SORROW BUT IT IS RATHER
GRANTED HIM TO WEEP
THE APOSTLE PAUL UNTO THE ROMANS
WRITETH 'MAN SHALL REJOICE WITH THEM THAT MAKE JOY AND WEEP
WITH SUCH FOLK AS WEEP BUT THOUGH TEMPERATE WEEPING BE
GRANTED OUTRAGEOUS WEEPING CERTES IS DEFENDED
MEASURE OF
WEEPING SHOULD BE CONSERVED AFTER THE LORE DOCTRINE THAT
TEACHETH US SENECA
'WHEN THAT THY FRIEND IS DEAD QUOTH HE 'LET
NOT THINE EYES TOO MOIST BE OF TEARS NOR TOO MUCH DRY ALTHOUGH
THE TEARS COME TO THINE EYES LET THEM NOT FALL
AND WHEN THOU
HAST FORGONE LOST THY FRIEND DO DILIGENCE TO GET AGAIN ANOTHER
FRIEND AND THIS IS MORE WISDOM THAN TO WEEP FOR THY FRIEND
WHICH THAT THOU HAST LORN LOST FOR THEREIN IS NO BOOT
ADVANTAGE
AND THEREFORE IF YE GOVERN YOU BY SAPIENCE PUT
AWAY SORROW OUT OF YOUR HEART
REMEMBER YOU THAT JESUS
SIRACH SAITH 'A MAN THAT IS JOYOUS AND GLAD IN HEART IT HIM
CONSERVETH FLOURISHING IN HIS AGE BUT SOOTHLY A SORROWFUL HEART
MAKETH HIS BONES DRY HE SAID EKE THUS 'THAT SORROW IN HEART
SLAYTH FULL MANY A MAN SOLOMON SAITH 'THAT RIGHT AS MOTHS IN
THE SHEEP'S FLEECE ANNOY DO INJURY TO THE CLOTHES AND THE SMALL
WORMS TO THE TREE RIGHT SO ANNOYETH SORROW TO THE HEART OF
MAN WHEREFORE US OUGHT AS WELL IN THE DEATH OF OUR CHILDREN
AS IN THE LOSS OF OUR GOODS TEMPORAL HAVE PATIENCE
REMEMBER
YOU UPON THE PATIENT JOB WHEN HE HAD LOST HIS CHILDREN AND HIS
TEMPORAL SUBSTANCE AND IN HIS BODY ENDURED AND RECEIVED FULL
MANY A GRIEVOUS TRIBULATION YET SAID HE THUS 'OUR LORD HATH
GIVEN IT TO ME OUR LORD HATH BEREFT IT ME RIGHT AS OUR LORD
WOULD RIGHT SO BE IT DONE BLESSED BE THE NAME OF OUR LORD
TO THESE FORESAID THINGS ANSWERED MELIBOEUS UNTO HIS WIFE
PRUDENCE ALL THY WORDS QUOTH HE BE TRUE AND THERETO
ALSO PROFITABLE BUT TRULY MINE HEART IS TROUBLED WITH THIS
SORROW SO GRIEVOUSLY THAT I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO LET CALL
QUOTH PRUDENCE THY TRUE FRIENDS ALL AND THY LINEAGE WHICH BE
WISE AND TELL TO THEM YOUR CASE AND HEARKEN WHAT THEY SAY IN
COUNSELLING AND GOVERN YOU AFTER THEIR SENTENCE OPINION
SOLOMON SAITH 'WORK ALL THINGS BY COUNSEL AND THOU SHALL NEVER
REPENT THEN BY COUNSEL OF HIS WIFE PRUDENCE THIS MELIBOEUS
LET CALL SENT FOR A GREAT CONGREGATION OF FOLK AS SURGEONS
PHYSICIANS OLD FOLK AND YOUNG AND SOME OF HIS OLD ENEMIES
RECONCILED AS BY THEIR SEMBLANCE TO HIS LOVE AND TO HIS GRACE
AND THEREWITHAL THERE COME SOME OF HIS NEIGHBOURS THAT DID HIM
REVERENCE MORE FOR DREAD THAN FOR LOVE AS HAPPENETH OFT
THERE
COME ALSO FULL MANY SUBTLE FLATTERERS AND WISE ADVOCATES
LEARNED IN THE LAW
AND WHEN THESE FOLK TOGETHER ASSEMBLED
WERE THIS MELIBOEUS IN SORROWFUL WISE SHOWED THEM HIS CASE
AND BY THE MANNER OF HIS SPEECH IT SEEMED THAT IN HEART HE BARE
A CRUEL IRE READY TO DO VENGEANCE UPON HIS FOES AND SUDDENLY
DESIRED THAT THE WAR SHOULD BEGIN BUT NEVERTHELESS YET ASKED HE
THEIR COUNSEL IN THIS MATTER
A SURGEON BY LICENCE AND ASSENT OF
SUCH AS WERE WISE UP ROSE AND TO MELIBOEUS SAID AS YE MAY
HEAR
SIR QUOTH HE AS TO US SURGEONS APPERTAINETH THAT WE
DO TO EVERY WIGHT THE BEST THAT WE CAN WHERE AS WE BE
WITHHOLDEN EMPLOYED AND TO OUR PATIENT THAT WE DO NO
DAMAGE WHEREFORE IT HAPPENETH MANY A TIME AND OFT THAT WHEN
TWO MEN HAVE WOUNDED EACH OTHER ONE SAME SURGEON HEALETH
THEM BOTH WHEREFORE UNTO OUR ART IT IS NOT PERTINENT TO NURSE
WAR NOR PARTIES TO SUPPORT TAKE SIDES
BUT CERTES AS TO THE
WARISHING HEALING OF YOUR DAUGHTER ALBEIT SO THAT PERILOUSLY
SHE BE WOUNDED WE SHALL DO SO ATTENTIVE BUSINESS FROM DAY TO
NIGHT THAT WITH THE GRACE OF GOD SHE SHALL BE WHOLE AND
SOUND AS SOON AS IS POSSIBLE ALMOST RIGHT IN THE SAME WISE THE
PHYSICIANS ANSWERED SAVE THAT THEY SAID A FEW WORDS MORE THAT
RIGHT AS MALADIES BE CURED BY THEIR CONTRARIES RIGHT SO SHALL MAN
WARISH WAR BY PEACE
HIS NEIGHBOURS FULL OF ENVY HIS FEIGNED
FRIENDS THAT SEEMED RECONCILED AND HIS FLATTERERS MADE
SEMBLANCE OF WEEPING AND IMPAIRED AND AGREGGED AGGRAVATED
MUCH OF THIS MATTER IN PRAISING GREATLY MELIBOEUS OF MIGHT OF
POWER OF RICHES AND OF FRIENDS DESPISING THE POWER OF HIS
ADVERSARIES AND SAID UTTERLY THAT HE ANON SHOULD WREAK HIM ON
HIS FOES AND BEGIN WAR
UP ROSE THEN AN ADVOCATE THAT WAS WISE BY LEAVE AND BY
COUNSEL OF OTHER THAT WERE WISE AND SAID LORDINGS THE NEED
BUSINESS FOR WHICH WE BE ASSEMBLED IN THIS PLACE IS A FULL
HEAVY THING AND AN HIGH MATTER BECAUSE OF THE WRONG AND OF
THE WICKEDNESS THAT HATH BEEN DONE AND EKE BY REASON OF THE
GREAT DAMAGES THAT IN TIME COMING BE POSSIBLE TO FALL FOR THE
SAME CAUSE AND EKE BY REASON OF THE GREAT RICHES AND POWER OF
THE PARTIES BOTH FOR WHICH REASONS IT WERE A FULL GREAT PERIL TO
ERR IN THIS MATTER
WHEREFORE MELIBOEUS THIS IS OUR SENTENCE
OPINION WE COUNSEL YOU ABOVE ALL THINGS THAT RIGHT ANON THOU
DO THY DILIGENCE IN KEEPING OF THY BODY IN SUCH A WISE THAT THOU
WANT NO ESPY NOR WATCH THY BODY TO SAVE
AND AFTER THAT WE
COUNSEL THAT IN THINE HOUSE THOU SET SUFFICIENT GARRISON SO THAT
THEY MAY AS WELL THY BODY AS THY HOUSE DEFEND
BUT CERTES TO
MOVE WAR OR SUDDENLY TO DO VENGEANCE WE MAY NOT DEEM
JUDGE IN SO LITTLE TIME THAT IT WERE PROFITABLE
WHEREFORE WE
ASK LEISURE AND SPACE TO HAVE DELIBERATION IN THIS CASE TO DEEM
FOR THE COMMON PROVERB SAITH THUS 'HE THAT SOON DEEMETH SOON
SHALL REPENT AND EKE MEN SAY THAT THAT JUDGE IS WISE THAT SOON
UNDERSTANDETH A MATTER AND JUDGETH BY LEISURE
FOR ALBEIT SO
THAT ALL TARRYING BE ANNOYING ALGATES NEVERTHELESS IT IS NO
REPROOF SUBJECT FOR REPROACH IN GIVING OF JUDGEMENT NOR IN
VENGEANCE TAKING WHEN IT IS SUFFICIENT AND REASONABLE
AND
THAT SHEWED OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST BY EXAMPLE FOR WHEN THAT
THE WOMAN THAT WAS TAKEN IN ADULTERY WAS BROUGHT IN HIS
PRESENCE TO KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH HER PERSON ALBEIT
THAT HE WIST WELL HIMSELF WHAT HE WOULD ANSWER YET WOULD HE
NOT ANSWER SUDDENLY BUT HE WOULD HAVE DELIBERATION AND IN THE
GROUND HE WROTE TWICE
AND BY THESE CAUSES WE ASK DELIBERATION
AND WE SHALL THEN BY THE GRACE OF GOD COUNSEL THE THING THAT
SHALL BE PROFITABLE
UP STARTED THEN THE YOUNG FOLK ANON AT ONCE AND THE MOST PART
OF THAT COMPANY HAVE SCORNED THESE OLD WISE MEN AND BEGUN TO
MAKE NOISE AND SAID RIGHT AS WHILE THAT IRON IS HOT MEN SHOULD
SMITE RIGHT SO MEN SHOULD WREAK THEIR WRONGS WHILE THAT THEY
BE FRESH AND NEW AND WITH LOUD VOICE THEY CRIED
WAR WAR
UP ROSE THEN ONE OF THESE OLD WISE AND WITH HIS HAND MADE
COUNTENANCE A SIGN GESTURE THAT MEN SHOULD HOLD THEM STILL
AND GIVE HIM AUDIENCE
LORDINGS QUOTH HE THERE IS FULL MANY
A MAN THAT CRIETH 'WAR WAR THAT WOT FULL LITTLE WHAT WAR
AMOUNTETH
WAR AT HIS BEGINNING HATH SO GREAT AN ENTERING AND
SO LARGE THAT EVERY WIGHT MAY ENTER WHEN HIM LIKETH AND LIGHTLY
EASILY FIND WAR BUT CERTES WHAT END SHALL FALL THEREOF IT IS NOT
LIGHT TO KNOW
FOR SOOTHLY WHEN WAR IS ONCE BEGUN THERE IS FULL
MANY A CHILD UNBORN OF HIS MOTHER THAT SHALL STERVE DIE YOUNG
BY CAUSE OF THAT WAR OR ELSE LIVE IN SORROW AND DIE IN
WRETCHEDNESS AND THEREFORE ERE THAT ANY WAR BE BEGUN MEN
MUST HAVE GREAT COUNSEL AND GREAT DELIBERATION AND WHEN THIS
OLD MAN WEENED THOUGHT INTENDED TO ENFORCE HIS TALE BY
REASONS WELL NIGH ALL AT ONCE BEGAN THEY TO RISE FOR TO BREAK HIS
TALE AND BID HIM FULL OFT HIS WORDS ABRIDGE
FOR SOOTHLY HE THAT
PREACHETH TO THEM THAT LIST NOT HEAR HIS WORDS HIS SERMON THEM
ANNOYETH
FOR JESUS SIRACH SAITH THAT MUSIC IN WEEPING IS A
NOYOUS TROUBLESOME THING
THIS IS TO SAY AS MUCH AVAILETH TO
SPEAK BEFORE FOLK TO WHOM HIS SPEECH ANNOYETH AS TO SING
BEFORE HIM THAT WEEPETH
AND WHEN THIS WISE MAN SAW THAT HIM
WANTED AUDIENCE ALL SHAMEFAST HE SAT HIM DOWN AGAIN
FOR
SOLOMON SAITH 'WHERE AS THOU MAYEST HAVE NO AUDIENCE
ENFORCE THEE NOT TO SPEAK I SEE WELL QUOTH THIS WISE MAN
THAT THE COMMON PROVERB IS SOOTH THAT GOOD COUNSEL WANTETH
WHEN IT IS MOST NEED YET BESIDES FURTHER HAD THIS MELIBOEUS
IN HIS COUNCIL MANY FOLK THAT PRIVILY IN HIS EAR COUNSELLED HIM
CERTAIN THING AND COUNSELLED HIM THE CONTRARY IN GENERAL
AUDIENCE
WHEN MELIBOEUS HAD HEARD THAT THE GREATEST PART OF
HIS COUNCIL WERE ACCORDED IN AGREEMENT THAT HE SHOULD MAKE
WAR ANON HE CONSENTED TO THEIR COUNSELLING AND FULLY AFFIRMED
THEIR SENTENCE OPINION JUDGEMENT
DAME PRUDENCE SEEING HER HUSBAND'S RESOLUTION THUS TAKEN IN
FULL HUMBLE WISE WHEN SHE SAW HER TIME BEGINS TO COUNSEL HIM
AGAINST WAR BY A WARNING AGAINST HASTE IN REQUITAL OF EITHER
GOOD OR EVIL
MELIBOEUS TELLS HER THAT HE WILL NOT WORK BY HER
COUNSEL BECAUSE HE SHOULD BE HELD A FOOL IF HE REJECTED FOR HER
ADVICE THE OPINION OF SO MANY WISE MEN BECAUSE ALL WOMEN ARE
BAD BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT HE HAD GIVEN HER THE MASTERY
OVER HIM AND BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT KEEP HIS SECRET IF HE
RESOLVED TO FOLLOW HER ADVICE
TO THESE REASONS PRUDENCE
ANSWERS THAT IT IS NO FOLLY TO CHANGE COUNSEL WHEN THINGS OR
MEN'S JUDGEMENTS OF THEM CHANGE ESPECIALLY TO ALTER A
RESOLUTION TAKEN ON THE IMPULSE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF FOLK
WHERE EVERY MAN CRIETH AND CLATTERETH WHAT HIM LIKETH THAT IF ALL
WOMEN HAD BEEN WICKED JESUS CHRIST WOULD NEVER HAVE
DESCENDED TO BE BORN OF A WOMAN NOR HAVE SHOWED HIMSELF
FIRST TO A WOMAN AFTER HIS RESURRECTION AND THAT WHEN SOLOMON
SAID HE HAD FOUND NO GOOD WOMAN HE MEANT THAT GOD ALONE
WAS SUPREMELY GOOD 3 THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD NOT SEEM TO
GIVE HER THE MASTERY BY FOLLOWING HER COUNSEL FOR HE HAD HIS
OWN FREE CHOICE IN FOLLOWING OR REJECTING IT AND THAT HE KNEW
WELL AND HAD OFTEN TESTED HER GREAT SILENCE PATIENCE AND
SECRECY
AND WHEREAS HE HAD QUOTED A SAYING THAT IN WICKED
COUNSEL WOMEN VANQUISH MEN SHE REMINDS HIM THAT SHE WOULD
COUNSEL HIM AGAINST DOING A WICKEDNESS ON WHICH HE HAD SET HIS
MIND AND CITES INSTANCES TO SHOW THAT MANY WOMEN HAVE BEEN
AND YET ARE FULL GOOD AND THEIR COUNSEL WHOLESOME AND
PROFITABLE
LASTLY SHE QUOTES THE WORDS OF GOD HIMSELF WHEN
HE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE WOMAN AS AN HELP MEET FOR MAN AND
PROMISES THAT IF HER HUSBAND WILL TRUST HER COUNSEL SHE WILL
RESTORE TO HIM HIS DAUGHTER WHOLE AND SOUND AND MAKE HIM
HAVE HONOUR IN THIS CASE
MELIBOEUS ANSWERS THAT BECAUSE OF HIS
WIFE'S SWEET WORDS AND ALSO BECAUSE HE HAS PROVED AND ASSAYED
HER GREAT WISDOM AND HER GREAT TRUTH HE WILL GOVERN HIM BY HER
COUNSEL IN ALL THINGS
THUS ENCOURAGED PRUDENCE ENTERS ON A
LONG DISCOURSE FULL OF LEARNED CITATIONS REGARDING THE MANNER IN
WHICH COUNSELLORS SHOULD BE CHOSEN AND CONSULTED AND THE
TIMES AND REASONS FOR CHANGING A COUNSEL
FIRST GOD MUST BE
BESOUGHT FOR GUIDANCE
THEN A MAN MUST WELL EXAMINE HIS OWN
THOUGHTS OF SUCH THINGS AS HE HOLDS TO BE BEST FOR HIS OWN
PROFIT DRIVING OUT OF HIS HEART ANGER COVETOUSNESS AND
HASTINESS WHICH PERTURB AND PERVERT THE JUDGEMENT
THEN HE
MUST KEEP HIS COUNSEL SECRET UNLESS CONFIDING IT TO ANOTHER SHALL
BE MORE PROFITABLE BUT IN SO CONFIDING IT HE SHALL SAY NOTHING
TO BIAS THE MIND OF THE COUNSELLOR TOWARD FLATTERY OR
SUBSERVIENCY
AFTER THAT HE SHOULD CONSIDER HIS FRIENDS AND HIS
ENEMIES CHOOSING OF THE FORMER SUCH AS BE MOST FAITHFUL AND
WISE AND ELDEST AND MOST APPROVED IN COUNSELLING AND EVEN OF
THESE ONLY A FEW
THEN HE MUST ESCHEW THE COUNSELLING OF FOOLS
OF FLATTERERS OF HIS OLD ENEMIES THAT BE RECONCILED OF SERVANTS
WHO BEAR HIM GREAT REVERENCE AND FEAR OF FOLK THAT BE DRUNKEN
AND CAN HIDE NO COUNSEL OF SUCH AS COUNSEL ONE THING PRIVILY
AND THE CONTRARY OPENLY AND OF YOUNG FOLK FOR THEIR COUNSELLING
IS NOT RIPE
THEN IN EXAMINING HIS COUNSEL HE MUST TRULY TELL HIS
TALE HE MUST CONSIDER WHETHER THE THING HE PROPOSES TO DO BE
REASONABLE WITHIN HIS POWER AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE MORE PART
AND THE BETTER PART OF HIS COUNSELLORS HE MUST LOOK AT THE THINGS
THAT MAY FOLLOW FROM THAT COUNSELLING CHOOSING THE BEST AND
WAIVING ALL BESIDES HE MUST CONSIDER THE ROOT WHENCE THE
MATTER OF HIS COUNSEL IS ENGENDERED WHAT FRUITS IT MAY BEAR
AND FROM WHAT CAUSES THEY BE SPRUNG
AND HAVING THUS
EXAMINED HIS COUNSEL AND APPROVED IT BY MANY WISE FOLK AND
OLD HE SHALL CONSIDER IF HE MAY PERFORM IT AND MAKE OF IT A GOOD
END IF HE BE IN DOUBT HE SHALL CHOOSE RATHER TO SUFFER THAN TO
BEGIN BUT OTHERWISE HE SHALL PROSECUTE HIS RESOLUTION STEADFASTLY
TILL THE ENTERPRISE BE AT AN END
AS TO CHANGING HIS COUNSEL A
MAN MAY DO SO WITHOUT REPROACH IF THE CAUSE CEASE OR WHEN A
NEW CASE BETIDES OR IF HE FIND THAT BY ERROR OR OTHERWISE HARM
OR DAMAGE MAY RESULT OR IF HIS COUNSEL BE DISHONEST OR COME OF
DISHONEST CAUSE OR IF IT BE IMPOSSIBLE OR MAY NOT PROPERLY BE
KEPT AND HE MUST TAKE IT FOR A GENERAL RULE THAT EVERY COUNSEL
WHICH IS AFFIRMED SO STRONGLY THAT IT MAY NOT BE CHANGED FOR
ANY CONDITION THAT MAY BETIDE THAT COUNSEL IS WICKED
MELIBOEUS ADMITTING THAT HIS WIFE HAD SPOKEN WELL AND SUITABLY
AS TO COUNSELLORS AND COUNSEL IN GENERAL PRAYS HER TO TELL HIM IN
ESPECIAL WHAT SHE THINKS OF THE COUNSELLORS WHOM THEY HAVE
CHOSEN IN THEIR PRESENT NEED
PRUDENCE REPLIES THAT HIS COUNSEL IN
THIS CASE COULD NOT PROPERLY BE CALLED A COUNSELLING BUT A
MOVEMENT OF FOLLY AND POINTS OUT THAT HE HAS ERRED IN SUNDRY
WISE AGAINST THE RULES WHICH HE HAD JUST LAID DOWN
GRANTING
THAT HE HAS ERRED MELIBOEUS SAYS THAT HE IS ALL READY TO CHANGE
HIS COUNSEL RIGHT AS SHE WILL DEVISE FOR AS THE PROVERB RUNS TO
DO SIN IS HUMAN BUT TO PERSEVERE LONG IN SIN IS WORK OF THE
DEVIL
PRUDENCE THEN MINUTELY RECITES ANALYSES AND CRITICISES
THE COUNSEL GIVEN TO HER HUSBAND IN THE ASSEMBLY OF HIS FRIENDS
SHE COMMENDS THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS AND
URGES THAT THEY SHOULD BE WELL REWARDED FOR THEIR NOBLE SPEECH
AND THEIR SERVICES IN HEALING SOPHIA AND SHE ASKS MELIBOEUS
HOW HE UNDERSTANDS THEIR PROPOSITION THAT ONE CONTRARY MUST BE
CURED BY ANOTHER CONTRARY
MELIBOEUS ANSWERS THAT HE SHOULD
DO VENGEANCE ON HIS ENEMIES WHO HAD DONE HIM WRONG
PRUDENCE HOWEVER INSISTS THAT VENGEANCE IS NOT THE CONTRARY OF
VENGEANCE NOR WRONG OF WRONG BUT THE LIKE AND THAT
WICKEDNESS SHOULD BE HEALED BY GOODNESS DISCORD BY ACCORD
WAR BY PEACE
SHE PROCEEDS TO DEAL WITH THE COUNSEL OF THE
LAWYERS AND WISE FOLK THAT ADVISED MELIBOEUS TO TAKE PRUDENT
MEASURES FOR THE SECURITY OF HIS BODY AND OF HIS HOUSE
FIRST SHE
WOULD HAVE HER HUSBAND PRAY FOR THE PROTECTION AND AID OF
CHRIST THEN COMMIT THE KEEPING OF HIS PERSON TO HIS TRUE
FRIENDS THEN SUSPECT AND AVOID ALL STRANGE FOLK AND LIARS AND
SUCH PEOPLE AS SHE HAD ALREADY WARNED HIM AGAINST THEN BEWARE
OF PRESUMING ON HIS STRENGTH OR THE WEAKNESS OF HIS ADVERSARY
AND NEGLECTING TO GUARD HIS PERSON FOR EVERY WISE MAN
DREADETH HIS ENEMY THEN HE SHOULD EVERMORE BE ON THE WATCH
AGAINST AMBUSH AND ALL ESPIAL EVEN IN WHAT SEEMS A PLACE OF
SAFETY THOUGH HE SHOULD NOT BE SO COWARDLY AS TO FEAR WHERE IS
NO CAUSE FOR DREAD YET HE SHOULD DREAD TO BE POISONED AND
THEREFORE SHUN SCORNERS AND FLY THEIR WORDS AS VENOM
AS TO
THE FORTIFICATION OF HIS HOUSE SHE POINTS OUT THAT TOWERS AND
GREAT EDIFICES ARE COSTLY AND LABORIOUS YET USELESS UNLESS
DEFENDED BY TRUE FRIENDS THAT BE OLD AND WISE AND THE GREATEST
AND STRONGEST GARRISON THAT A RICH MAN MAY HAVE AS WELL TO KEEP
HIS PERSON AS HIS GOODS IS THAT HE BE BELOVED BY HIS SUBJECTS
AND BY HIS NEIGHBOURS
WARMLY APPROVING THE COUNSEL THAT IN ALL
THIS BUSINESS MELIBOEUS SHOULD PROCEED WITH GREAT DILIGENCE AND
DELIBERATION PRUDENCE GOES ON TO EXAMINE THE ADVICE GIVEN BY
HIS NEIGHBOURS THAT DO HIM REVERENCE WITHOUT LOVE HIS OLD
ENEMIES RECONCILED HIS FLATTERERS THAT COUNSELLED HIM CERTAIN
THINGS PRIVILY AND OPENLY COUNSELLED HIM THE CONTRARY AND THE
YOUNG FOLK THAT COUNSELLED HIM TO AVENGE HIMSELF AND MAKE WAR
AT ONCE
SHE REMINDS HIM THAT HE STANDS ALONE AGAINST THREE
POWERFUL ENEMIES WHOSE KINDRED ARE NUMEROUS AND CLOSE
WHILE HIS ARE FEWER AND REMOTE IN RELATIONSHIP THAT ONLY THE
JUDGE WHO HAS JURISDICTION IN A CASE MAY TAKE SUDDEN VENGEANCE
ON ANY MAN THAT HER HUSBAND'S POWER DOES NOT ACCORD WITH HIS
DESIRE AND THAT IF HE DID TAKE VENGEANCE IT WOULD ONLY BREED
FRESH WRONGS AND CONTESTS
AS TO THE CAUSES OF THE WRONG DONE
TO HIM SHE HOLDS THAT GOD THE CAUSER OF ALL THINGS HAS
PERMITTED HIM TO SUFFER BECAUSE HE HAS DRUNK SO MUCH HONEY
4 OF SWEET TEMPORAL RICHES AND DELIGHTS AND HONOURS OF THIS
WORLD THAT HE IS DRUNKEN AND HAS FORGOTTEN JESUS CHRIST HIS
SAVIOUR THE THREE ENEMIES OF MANKIND THE FLESH THE FIEND AND
THE WORLD HAVE ENTERED HIS HEART BY THE WINDOWS OF HIS BODY
AND WOUNDED HIS SOUL IN FIVE PLACES THAT IS TO SAY THE DEADLY
SINS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO HIS HEART BY THE FIVE SENSES AND IN
THE SAME MANNER CHRIST HAS SUFFERED HIS THREE ENEMIES TO ENTER
HIS HOUSE BY THE WINDOWS AND WOUND HIS DAUGHTER IN THE FIVE
PLACES BEFORE SPECIFIED
MELIBOEUS DEMURS THAT IF HIS WIFE'S
OBJECTIONS PREVAILED VENGEANCE WOULD NEVER BE TAKEN AND
THENCE GREAT MISCHIEFS WOULD ARISE BUT PRUDENCE REPLIES THAT THE
TAKING OF VENGEANCE LIES WITH THE JUDGES TO WHOM THE PRIVATE
INDIVIDUAL MUST HAVE RECOURSE
MELIBOEUS DECLARES THAT SUCH
VENGEANCE DOES NOT PLEASE HIM AND THAT AS FORTUNE HAS
NOURISHED AND HELPED HIM FROM HIS CHILDHOOD HE WILL NOW ASSAY
HER TRUSTING WITH GOD'S HELP THAT SHE WILL AID HIM TO AVENGE HIS
SHAME
PRUDENCE WARNS HIM AGAINST TRUSTING TO FORTUNE ALL THE
LESS BECAUSE SHE HAS HITHERTO FAVOURED HIM FOR JUST ON THAT
ACCOUNT SHE IS THE MORE LIKELY TO FAIL HIM AND SHE CALLS ON HIM
TO LEAVE HIS VENGEANCE WITH THE SOVEREIGN JUDGE THAT AVENGETH
ALL VILLAINIES AND WRONGS
MELIBOEUS ARGUES THAT IF HE REFRAINS
FROM TAKING VENGEANCE HE WILL INVITE HIS ENEMIES TO DO HIM
FURTHER WRONG AND HE WILL BE PUT AND HELD OVER LOW BUT
PRUDENCE CONTENDS THAT SUCH A RESULT CAN BE BROUGHT ABOUT ONLY
BY THE NEGLECT OF THE JUDGES NOT BY THE PATIENCE OF THE
INDIVIDUAL
SUPPOSING THAT HE HAD LEAVE TO AVENGE HIMSELF SHE
REPEATS THAT HE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND QUOTES THE COMMON
SAW THAT IT IS MADNESS FOR A MAN TO STRIVE WITH A STRONGER THAN
HIMSELF PERIL TO STRIVE WITH ONE OF EQUAL STRENGTH AND FOLLY TO
STRIVE WITH A WEAKER
BUT CONSIDERING HIS OWN DEFAULTS AND
DEMERITS REMEMBERING THE PATIENCE OF CHRIST AND THE
UNDESERVED TRIBULATIONS OF THE SAINTS THE BREVITY OF THIS LIFE WITH
ALL ITS TROUBLE AND SORROW THE DISCREDIT THROWN ON THE WISDOM
AND TRAINING OF A MAN WHO CANNOT BEAR WRONG WITH PATIENCE
HE SHOULD REFRAIN WHOLLY FROM TAKING VENGEANCE
MELIBOEUS
SUBMITS THAT HE IS NOT AT ALL A PERFECT MAN AND HIS HEART WILL
NEVER BE AT PEACE UNTIL HE IS AVENGED AND THAT AS HIS ENEMIES
DISREGARDED THE PERIL WHEN THEY ATTACKED HIM SO HE MIGHT
WITHOUT REPROACH INCUR SOME PERIL IN ATTACKING THEM IN RETURN
EVEN THOUGH HE DID A GREAT EXCESS IN AVENGING ONE WRONG BY
ANOTHER
PRUDENCE STRONGLY DEPRECATES ALL OUTRAGE OR EXCESS BUT
MELIBOEUS INSISTS THAT HE CANNOT SEE THAT IT MIGHT GREATLY HARM
HIM THOUGH HE TOOK A VENGEANCE FOR HE IS RICHER AND MIGHTIER
THAN HIS ENEMIES AND ALL THINGS OBEY MONEY
PRUDENCE
THEREUPON LAUNCHES INTO A LONG DISSERTATION ON THE ADVANTAGES OF
RICHES THE EVILS OF POVERTY THE MEANS BY WHICH WEALTH SHOULD
BE GATHERED AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT SHOULD BE USED AND
CONCLUDES BY COUNSELLING HER HUSBAND NOT TO MOVE WAR AND
BATTLE THROUGH TRUST IN HIS RICHES FOR THEY SUFFICE NOT TO MAINTAIN
WAR THE BATTLE IS NOT ALWAYS TO THE STRONG OR THE NUMEROUS AND
THE PERILS OF CONFLICT ARE MANY
MELIBOEUS THEN CURTLY ASKS HER
FOR HER COUNSEL HOW HE SHALL DO IN THIS NEED AND SHE ANSWERS
THAT CERTAINLY SHE COUNSELS HIM TO AGREE WITH HIS ADVERSARIES AND
HAVE PEACE WITH THEM
MELIBOEUS ON THIS CRIES OUT THAT PLAINLY
SHE LOVES NOT HIS HONOUR OR HIS WORSHIP IN COUNSELLING HIM TO
GO AND HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE HIS ENEMIES CRYING MERCY TO THEM
THAT HAVING DONE HIM SO GRIEVOUS WRONG ASK HIM NOT TO BE
RECONCILED
THEN PRUDENCE MAKING SEMBLANCE OF WRATH RETORTS
THAT SHE LOVES HIS HONOUR AND PROFIT AS SHE LOVES HER OWN AND
EVER HAS DONE SHE CITES THE SCRIPTURES IN SUPPORT OF HER COUNSEL
TO SEEK PEACE AND SAYS SHE WILL LEAVE HIM TO HIS OWN COURSES
FOR SHE KNOWS WELL HE IS SO STUBBORN THAT HE WILL DO NOTHING FOR
HER
MELIBOEUS THEN RELENTS ADMITS THAT HE IS ANGRY AND CANNOT
JUDGE ARIGHT AND PUTS HIMSELF WHOLLY IN HER HANDS PROMISING TO
DO JUST AS SHE DESIRES AND ADMITTING THAT HE IS THE MORE HELD TO
LOVE AND PRAISE HER IF SHE REPROVES HIM OF HIS FOLLY
THEN DAME PRUDENCE DISCOVERED ALL HER COUNSEL AND HER WILL
UNTO HIM AND SAID I COUNSEL YOU QUOTH SHE ABOVE ALL
THINGS THAT YE MAKE PEACE BETWEEN GOD AND YOU AND BE
RECONCILED UNTO HIM AND TO HIS GRACE FOR AS I HAVE SAID TO YOU
HEREBEFORE GOD HATH SUFFERED YOU TO HAVE THIS TRIBULATION AND
DISEASE DISTRESS TROUBLE FOR YOUR SINS AND IF YE DO AS I SAY
YOU GOD WILL SEND YOUR ADVERSARIES UNTO YOU AND MAKE THEM
FALL AT YOUR FEET READY TO DO YOUR WILL AND YOUR COMMANDMENT
FOR SOLOMON SAITH 'WHEN THE CONDITION OF MAN IS PLEASANT AND
LIKING TO GOD HE CHANGETH THE HEARTS OF THE MAN'S ADVERSARIES
AND CONSTRAINETH THEM TO BESEECH HIM OF PEACE OF GRACE AND I
PRAY YOU LET ME SPEAK WITH YOUR ADVERSARIES IN PRIVY PLACE FOR
THEY SHALL NOT KNOW IT IS BY YOUR WILL OR YOUR ASSENT AND THEN
WHEN I KNOW THEIR WILL AND THEIR INTENT I MAY COUNSEL YOU THE
MORE SURELY DAME QUOTH MELIBOEUS DO YOUR WILL AND
YOUR LIKING FOR I PUT ME WHOLLY IN YOUR DISPOSITION AND
ORDINANCE
THEN DAME PRUDENCE WHEN SHE SAW THE GOODWILL OF HER
HUSBAND DELIBERATED AND TOOK ADVICE IN HERSELF THINKING HOW
SHE MIGHT BRING THIS NEED AFFAIR EMERGENCY UNTO A GOOD END
AND WHEN SHE SAW HER TIME SHE SENT FOR THESE ADVERSARIES TO
COME INTO HER INTO A PRIVY PLACE AND SHOWED WISELY INTO THEM
THE GREAT GOODS THAT COME OF PEACE AND THE GREAT HARMS AND
PERILS THAT BE IN WAR AND SAID TO THEM IN GOODLY MANNER HOW
THAT THEY OUGHT HAVE GREAT REPENTANCE OF THE INJURIES AND
WRONGS THAT THEY HAD DONE TO MELIBOEUS HER LORD AND UNTO HER
AND HER DAUGHTER
AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE GOODLY WORDS OF
DAME PRUDENCE THEN THEY WERE SURPRISED AND RAVISHED AND HAD
SO GREAT JOY OF HER THAT WONDER WAS TO TELL
AH LADY QUOTH
THEY YE HAVE SHOWED UNTO US THE BLESSING OF SWEETNESS AFTER
THE SAYING OF DAVID THE PROPHET FOR THE RECONCILING WHICH WE
BE NOT WORTHY TO HAVE IN NO MANNER BUT WE OUGHT REQUIRE IT
WITH GREAT CONTRITION AND HUMILITY YE OF YOUR GREAT GOODNESS
HAVE PRESENTED UNTO US
NOW SEE WE WELL THAT THE SCIENCE AND
CONNING KNOWLEDGE OF SOLOMON IS FULL TRUE FOR HE SAITH THAT
SWEET WORDS MULTIPLY AND INCREASE FRIENDS AND MAKE SHREWS
THE ILL NATURED OR ANGRY TO BE DEBONAIR GENTLE COURTEOUS AND
MEEK
CERTES WE PUT OUR DEED AND ALL OUR MATTER AND CAUSE ALL
WHOLLY IN YOUR GOODWILL AND BE READY TO OBEY UNTO THE SPEECH
AND COMMANDMENT OF MY LORD MELIBOEUS
AND THEREFORE DEAR
AND BENIGN LADY WE PRAY YOU AND BESEECH YOU AS MEEKLY AS WE
CAN AND MAY THAT IT LIKE UNTO YOUR GREAT GOODNESS TO FULFIL IN
DEED YOUR GOODLY WORDS
FOR WE CONSIDER AND ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT WE HAVE OFFENDED AND GRIEVED MY LORD MELIBOEUS OUT OF
MEASURE SO FAR FORTH THAT WE BE NOT OF POWER TO MAKE HIM
AMENDS AND THEREFORE WE OBLIGE AND BIND US AND OUR FRIENDS TO
DO ALL HIS WILL AND HIS COMMANDMENT
BUT PERADVENTURE HE HATH
SUCH HEAVINESS AND SUCH WRATH TO USWARD TOWARDS US BECAUSE
OF OUR OFFENCE THAT HE WILL ENJOIN US SUCH A PAIN PENALTY AS WE
MAY NOT BEAR NOR SUSTAIN AND THEREFORE NOBLE LADY WE BESEECH
TO YOUR WOMANLY PITY TO TAKE SUCH ADVISEMENT CONSIDERATION
IN THIS NEED THAT WE NOR OUR FRIENDS BE NOT DISINHERITED AND
DESTROYED THROUGH OUR FOLLY
CERTES QUOTH PRUDENCE IT IS AN HARD THING AND RIGHT
PERILOUS THAT A MAN PUT HIM ALL UTTERLY IN THE ARBITRATION AND
JUDGEMENT AND IN THE MIGHT AND POWER OF HIS ENEMY
FOR
SOLOMON SAITH 'BELIEVE ME AND GIVE CREDENCE TO THAT THAT I
SHALL SAY TO THY SON TO THY WIFE TO THY FRIEND NOR TO THY
BROTHER GIVE THOU NEVER MIGHT NOR MASTERY OVER THY BODY WHILE
THOU LIVEST NOW SINCE HE DEFENDETH FORBIDDETH THAT A MAN
SHOULD NOT GIVE TO HIS BROTHER NOR TO HIS FRIEND THE MIGHT OF HIS
BODY BY A STRONGER REASON HE DEFENDETH AND FORBIDDETH A MAN
TO GIVE HIMSELF TO HIS ENEMY
AND NEVERTHELESS I COUNSEL YOU
THAT YE MISTRUST NOT MY LORD FOR I WOT WELL AND KNOW VERILY
THAT HE IS DEBONAIR AND MEEK LARGE COURTEOUS AND NOTHING
DESIROUS NOR ENVIOUS OF GOOD NOR RICHES FOR THERE IS NOTHING IN
THIS WORLD THAT HE DESIRETH SAVE ONLY WORSHIP AND HONOUR
FURTHERMORE I KNOW WELL AND AM RIGHT SURE THAT HE SHALL
NOTHING DO IN THIS NEED WITHOUT COUNSEL OF ME AND I SHALL SO
WORK IN THIS CASE THAT BY THE GRACE OF OUR LORD GOD YE SHALL BE
RECONCILED UNTO US
THEN SAID THEY WITH ONE VOICE WORSHIPFUL LADY WE PUT US
AND OUR GOODS ALL FULLY IN YOUR WILL AND DISPOSITION AND BE READY
TO COME WHAT DAY THAT IT LIKE UNTO YOUR NOBLENESS TO LIMIT US OR
ASSIGN US FOR TO MAKE OUR OBLIGATION AND BOND AS STRONG AS IT
LIKETH UNTO YOUR GOODNESS THAT WE MAY FULFIL THE WILL OF YOU AND
OF MY LORD MELIBOEUS
WHEN DAME PRUDENCE HAD HEARD THE ANSWER OF THESE MEN SHE
BADE THEM GO AGAIN PRIVILY AND SHE RETURNED TO HER LORD
MELIBOEUS AND TOLD HIM HOW SHE FOUND HIS ADVERSARIES FULL
REPENTANT ACKNOWLEDGING FULL LOWLY THEIR SINS AND TRESPASSES
AND HOW THEY WERE READY TO SUFFER ALL PAIN REQUIRING AND
PRAYING HIM OF MERCY AND PITY
THEN SAID MELIBOEUS HE IS WELL
WORTHY TO HAVE PARDON AND FORGIVENESS OF HIS SIN THAT EXCUSETH
NOT HIS SIN BUT ACKNOWLEDGETH AND REPENTETH HIM ASKING
INDULGENCE
FOR SENECA SAITH 'THERE IS THE REMISSION AND
FORGIVENESS WHERE THE CONFESSION IS FOR CONFESSION IS NEIGHBOUR
TO INNOCENCE AND THEREFORE I ASSENT AND CONFIRM ME TO HAVE
PEACE BUT IT IS GOOD THAT WE DO NAUGHT WITHOUT THE ASSENT AND
WILL OF OUR FRIENDS THEN WAS PRUDENCE RIGHT GLAD AND JOYFUL
AND SAID CERTES SIR YE BE WELL AND GOODLY ADVISED FOR RIGHT
AS BY THE COUNSEL ASSENT AND HELP OF YOUR FRIENDS YE HAVE BEEN
STIRRED TO AVENGE YOU AND MAKE WAR RIGHT SO WITHOUT THEIR
COUNSEL SHALL YE NOT ACCORD YOU NOR HAVE PEACE WITH YOUR
ADVERSARIES
FOR THE LAW SAITH 'THERE IS NOTHING SO GOOD BY WAY
OF KIND NATURE AS A THING TO BE UNBOUND BY HIM THAT IT WAS
BOUND
AND THEN DAME PRUDENCE WITHOUT DELAY OR TARRYING SENT ANON
HER MESSENGERS FOR THEIR KIN AND FOR THEIR OLD FRIENDS WHICH
WERE TRUE AND WISE AND TOLD THEM BY ORDER IN THE PRESENCE OF
MELIBOEUS ALL THIS MATTER AS IT IS ABOVE EXPRESSED AND DECLARED
AND PRAYED THEM THAT THEY WOULD GIVE THEIR ADVICE AND COUNSEL
WHAT WERE BEST TO DO IN THIS NEED
AND WHEN MELIBOEUS' FRIENDS
HAD TAKEN THEIR ADVICE AND DELIBERATION OF THE FORESAID MATTER
AND HAD EXAMINED IT BY GREAT BUSINESS AND GREAT DILIGENCE THEY
GAVE FULL COUNSEL FOR TO HAVE PEACE AND REST AND THAT MELIBOEUS
SHOULD WITH GOOD HEART RECEIVE HIS ADVERSARIES TO FORGIVENESS
AND MERCY
AND WHEN DAME PRUDENCE HAD HEARD THE ASSENT OF
HER LORD MELIBOEUS AND THE COUNSEL OF HIS FRIENDS ACCORD WITH
HER WILL AND HER INTENTION SHE WAS WONDROUS GLAD IN HER HEART
AND SAID THERE IS AN OLD PROVERB THAT SAITH 'THE GOODNESS THAT
THOU MAYEST DO THIS DAY DO IT AND ABIDE NOT NOR DELAY IT NOT TILL
TO MORROW AND THEREFORE I COUNSEL YOU THAT YE SEND YOUR
MESSENGERS SUCH AS BE DISCREET AND WISE UNTO YOUR ADVERSARIES
TELLING THEM ON YOUR BEHALF THAT IF THEY WILL TREAT OF PEACE AND
OF ACCORD THAT THEY SHAPE PREPARE THEM WITHOUT DELAY OR
TARRYING TO COME UNTO US WHICH THING PERFORMED WAS INDEED
AND WHEN THESE TRESPASSERS AND REPENTING FOLK OF THEIR FOLLIES
THAT IS TO SAY THE ADVERSARIES OF MELIBOEUS HAD HEARD WHAT
THESE MESSENGERS SAID UNTO THEM THEY WERE RIGHT GLAD AND
JOYFUL AND ANSWERED FULL MEEKLY AND BENIGNLY YIELDING GRACES
AND THANKS TO THEIR LORD MELIBOEUS AND TO ALL HIS COMPANY AND
SHAPED THEM WITHOUT DELAY TO GO WITH THE MESSENGERS AND OBEY
TO THE COMMANDMENT OF THEIR LORD MELIBOEUS
AND RIGHT ANON
THEY TOOK THEIR WAY TO THE COURT OF MELIBOEUS AND TOOK WITH
THEM SOME OF THEIR TRUE FRIENDS TO MAKE FAITH FOR THEM AND FOR
TO BE THEIR BORROWS SURETIES
AND WHEN THEY WERE COME TO THE PRESENCE OF MELIBOEUS HE
SAID TO THEM THESE WORDS IT STANDS THUS QUOTH MELIBOEUS
AND SOOTH IT IS THAT YE CAUSELESS AND WITHOUT SKILL AND REASON
HAVE DONE GREAT INJURIES AND WRONGS TO ME AND TO MY WIFE
PRUDENCE AND TO MY DAUGHTER ALSO FOR YE HAVE ENTERED INTO MY
HOUSE BY VIOLENCE AND HAVE DONE SUCH OUTRAGE THAT ALL MEN
KNOW WELL THAT YE HAVE DESERVED THE DEATH AND THEREFORE WILL I
KNOW AND WEET OF YOU WHETHER YE WILL PUT THE PUNISHING AND
CHASTISING AND THE VENGEANCE OF THIS OUTRAGE IN THE WILL OF ME
AND OF MY WIFE OR YE WILL NOT THEN THE WISEST OF THEM THREE
ANSWERED FOR THEM ALL AND SAID SIR QUOTH HE WE KNOW WELL
THAT WE BE I UNWORTHY TO COME TO THE COURT OF SO GREAT A LORD
AND SO WORTHY AS YE BE FOR WE HAVE SO GREATLY MISTAKEN US AND
HAVE OFFENDED AND AGUILT INCURRED GUILT IN SUCH WISE AGAINST
YOUR HIGH LORDSHIP THAT TRULY WE HAVE DESERVED THE DEATH
BUT
YET FOR THE GREAT GOODNESS AND DEBONAIRTE COURTESY GENTLENESS
THAT ALL THE WORLD WITNESSETH OF YOUR PERSON WE SUBMIT US TO
THE EXCELLENCE AND BENIGNITY OF YOUR GRACIOUS LORDSHIP AND BE
READY TO OBEY TO ALL YOUR COMMANDMENTS BESEECHING YOU THAT
OF YOUR MERCIABLE MERCIFUL PITY YE WILL CONSIDER OUR GREAT
REPENTANCE AND LOW SUBMISSION AND GRANT US FORGIVENESS OF OUR
OUTRAGEOUS TRESPASS AND OFFENCE FOR WELL WE KNOW THAT YOUR
LIBERAL GRACE AND MERCY STRETCH THEM FARTHER INTO GOODNESS THAN
DO OUR OUTRAGEOUS GUILT AND TRESPASS INTO WICKEDNESS ALBEIT THAT
CURSEDLY WICKEDLY AND DAMNABLY WE HAVE AGUILT INCURRED
GUILT AGAINST YOUR HIGH LORDSHIP THEN MELIBOEUS TOOK THEM
UP FROM THE GROUND FULL BENIGNLY AND RECEIVED THEIR OBLIGATIONS
AND THEIR BONDS BY THEIR OATHS UPON THEIR PLEDGES AND BORROWS
SURETIES AND ASSIGNED THEM A CERTAIN DAY TO RETURN UNTO HIS
COURT FOR TO RECEIVE AND ACCEPT SENTENCE AND JUDGEMENT THAT
MELIBOEUS WOULD COMMAND TO BE DONE ON THEM BY THE CAUSES
AFORESAID WHICH THINGS ORDAINED EVERY MAN RETURNED HOME TO
HIS HOUSE
AND WHEN THAT DAME PRUDENCE SAW HER TIME SHE FREINED
INQUIRED AND ASKED HER LORD MELIBOEUS WHAT VENGEANCE HE
THOUGHT TO TAKE OF HIS ADVERSARIES
TO WHICH MELIBOEUS
ANSWERED AND SAID CERTES QUOTH HE I THINK AND PURPOSE ME
FULLY TO DISINHERIT THEM OF ALL THAT EVER THEY HAVE AND FOR TO PUT
THEM IN EXILE FOR EVERMORE CERTES QUOTH DAME PRUDENCE
THIS WERE A CRUEL SENTENCE AND MUCH AGAINST REASON
FOR YE BE
RICH ENOUGH AND HAVE NO NEED OF OTHER MEN'S GOODS AND YE
MIGHT LIGHTLY EASILY IN THIS WISE GET YOU A COVETOUS NAME
WHICH IS A VICIOUS THING AND OUGHT TO BE ESCHEWED OF EVERY
GOOD MAN FOR AFTER THE SAYING OF THE APOSTLE COVETOUSNESS IS
ROOT OF ALL HARMS
AND THEREFORE IT WERE BETTER FOR YOU TO LOSE
MUCH GOOD OF YOUR OWN THAN FOR TO TAKE OF THEIR GOOD IN THIS
MANNER
FOR BETTER IT IS TO LOSE GOOD WITH WORSHIP HONOUR
THAN TO WIN GOOD WITH VILLAINY AND SHAME
AND EVERY MAN OUGHT
TO DO HIS DILIGENCE AND HIS BUSINESS TO GET HIM A GOOD NAME
AND YET FURTHER SHALL HE NOT ONLY BUSY HIM IN KEEPING HIS GOOD
NAME BUT HE SHALL ALSO ENFORCE HIM ALWAY TO DO SOME THING BY
WHICH HE MAY RENEW HIS GOOD NAME FOR IT IS WRITTEN THAT THE
OLD GOOD LOS REPUTATION 5 OF A MAN IS SOON GONE AND
PASSED WHEN IT IS NOT RENEWED
AND AS TOUCHING THAT YE SAY
THAT YE WILL EXILE YOUR ADVERSARIES THAT THINKETH YE MUCH AGAINST
REASON AND OUT OF MEASURE MODERATION CONSIDERED THE POWER
THAT THEY HAVE GIVEN YOU UPON THEMSELVES
AND IT IS WRITTEN
THAT HE IS WORTHY TO LOSE HIS PRIVILEGE THAT MISUSETH THE MIGHT
AND THE POWER THAT IS GIVEN HIM
AND I SET CASE IF I ASSUME YE
MIGHT ENJOIN THEM THAT PAIN BY RIGHT AND BY LAW WHICH I TROW
YE MAY NOT DO I SAY YE MIGHT NOT PUT IT TO EXECUTION
PERADVENTURE AND THEN IT WERE LIKE TO RETURN TO THE WAR AS IT
WAS BEFORE
AND THEREFORE IF YE WILL THAT MEN DO YOU OBEISANCE
YE MUST DEEM DECIDE MORE COURTEOUSLY THAT IS TO SAY YE MUST
GIVE MORE EASY SENTENCES AND JUDGEMENTS
FOR IT IS WRITTEN 'HE
THAT MOST COURTEOUSLY COMMANDETH TO HIM MEN MOST OBEY
AND THEREFORE I PRAY YOU THAT IN THIS NECESSITY AND IN THIS NEED
YE CAST YOU ENDEAVOUR DEVISE A WAY TO OVERCOME YOUR HEART
FOR SENECA SAITH THAT HE THAT OVERCOMETH HIS HEART OVERCOMETH
TWICE
AND TULLIUS SAITH 'THERE IS NOTHING SO COMMENDABLE IN A
GREAT LORD AS WHEN HE IS DEBONAIR AND MEEK AND APPEASETH HIM
LIGHTLY EASILY AND I PRAY YOU THAT YE WILL NOW FORBEAR TO DO
VENGEANCE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT YOUR GOOD NAME MAY BE KEPT
AND CONSERVED AND THAT MEN MAY HAVE CAUSE AND MATTER TO
PRAISE YOU OF PITY AND OF MERCY AND THAT YE HAVE NO CAUSE TO
REPENT YOU OF THING THAT YE DO
FOR SENECA SAITH 'HE
OVERCOMETH IN AN EVIL MANNER THAT REPENTETH HIM OF HIS VICTORY
WHEREFORE I PRAY YOU LET MERCY BE IN YOUR HEART TO THE EFFECT
AND INTENT THAT GOD ALMIGHTY HAVE MERCY UPON YOU IN HIS LAST
JUDGEMENT FOR SAINT JAMES SAITH IN HIS EPISTLE 'JUDGEMENT
WITHOUT MERCY SHALL BE DONE TO HIM THAT HATH NO MERCY OF
ANOTHER WIGHT
WHEN MELIBOEUS HAD HEARD THE GREAT SKILLS ARGUMENTS REASONS
AND REASONS OF DAME PRUDENCE AND HER WISE INFORMATION AND
TEACHING HIS HEART GAN INCLINE TO THE WILL OF HIS WIFE CONSIDERING
HER TRUE INTENT HE CONFORMED HIM ANON AND ASSENTED FULLY TO
WORK AFTER HER COUNSEL AND THANKED GOD OF WHOM PROCEEDETH
ALL GOODNESS AND ALL VIRTUE THAT HIM SENT A WIFE OF SO GREAT
DISCRETION
AND WHEN THE DAY CAME THAT HIS ADVERSARIES SHOULD
APPEAR IN HIS PRESENCE HE SPAKE TO THEM FULL GOODLY AND SAID IN
THIS WISE ALBEIT SO THAT OF YOUR PRIDE AND HIGH PRESUMPTION
AND FOLLY AN OF YOUR NEGLIGENCE AND UNCONNING IGNORANCE YE
HAVE MISBORNE MISBEHAVED YOU AND TRESPASSED DONE INJURY
UNTO ME YET FORASMUCH AS I SEE AND BEHOLD YOUR GREAT HUMILITY
AND THAT YE BE SORRY AND REPENTANT OF YOUR GUILTS IT CONSTRAINETH
ME TO DO YOU GRACE AND MERCY
WHEREFORE I RECEIVE YOU INTO MY
GRACE AND FORGIVE YOU UTTERLY ALL THE OFFENCES INJURIES AND
WRONGS THAT YE HAVE DONE AGAINST ME AND MINE TO THIS EFFECT
AND TO THIS END THAT GOD OF HIS ENDLESS MERCY WILL AT THE TIME OF
OUR DYING FORGIVE US OUR GUILTS THAT WE HAVE TRESPASSED TO HIM
IN THIS WRETCHED WORLD FOR DOUBTLESS IF WE BE SORRY AND
REPENTANT OF THE SINS AND GUILTS WHICH WE HAVE TRESPASSED IN THE
SIGHT OF OUR LORD GOD HE IS SO FREE AND SO MERCIABLE MERCIFUL
THAT HE WILL FORGIVE US OUR GUILTS AND BRING US TO THE BLISS THAT
NEVER HATH END AMEN
NOTES TO CHAUCER'S TALE OF MELIBOEUS
1
THE TALE OF MELIBOEUS IS LITERALLY TRANSLATED FROM A FRENCH
STORY OR RATHER TREATISE IN PROSE ENTITLED LE LIVRE DE
MELIBEE ET DE DAME PRUDENCE OF WHICH TWO MANUSCRIPTS BOTH
DATING FROM THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY ARE PRESERVED IN THE BRITISH
MUSEUM
TYRWHITT JUSTLY ENOUGH SAYS OF IT THAT IT IS INDEED AS
CHAUCER CALLED IT IN THE PROLOGUE 'A MORAL TALE VIRTUOUS AND
WAS PROBABLY MUCH ESTEEMED IN ITS TIME BUT IN THIS AGE OF
LEVITY I DOUBT SOME READERS WILL BE APT TO REGRET THAT HE DID NOT
RATHER GIVE US THE REMAINDER OF SIR THOPAS IT HAS BEEN
REMARKED THAT IN THE EARLIER PORTION OF THE TALE AS IT LEFT THE
HAND OF THE POET A NUMBER OF BLANK VERSES WERE INTERMIXED
THOUGH THIS PECULIARITY OF STYLE NOTICEABLE IN ANY CASE ONLY IN
THE FIRST 150 OR 200 LINES HAS NECESSARILY ALL BUT DISAPPEARED BY
THE CHANGES OF SPELLING MADE IN THE MODERN EDITIONS
THE
EDITOR'S PURPOSE BEING TO PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC NOT THE
CANTERBURY TALES MERELY BUT THE POEMS OF CHAUCER SO FAR
AS MAY BE CONSISTENT WITH THE LIMITS OF THIS VOLUME HE HAS
CONDENSED THE LONG REASONINGS AND LEARNED QUOTATIONS OF DAME
PRUDENCE INTO A MERE OUTLINE CONNECTING THOSE PORTIONS OF THE
TALE WHEREIN LIES SO MUCH OF STORY AS IT ACTUALLY POSSESSES AND
THE GENERAL READER WILL PROBABLY NOT REGRET THE SACRIFICE MADE IN
THE VIEW OF RETAINING SO FAR AS POSSIBLE THE COMPLETENESS OF THE
TALES WHILE LESSENING THE INTRUSION OF PROSE INTO A VOLUME OR
POEMS
THE GOOD WIFE OF MELIBOEUS LITERALLY OVERFLOWS WITH
QUOTATIONS FROM DAVID SOLOMON JESUS THE SON OF SIRACH THE
APOSTLES OVID CICERO SENECA CASSIODORUS CATO PETRUS
ALPHONSUS THE CONVERTED SPANISH JEW OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY
WHO WROTE THE DISCIPLINA CLERICALIS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES
AND IN SOME PASSAGES ESPECIALLY WHERE HUSBAND AND WIFE DEBATE
THE MERITS OR DEMERITS OF WOMEN AND WHERE PRUDENCE DILATES
ON THE EVILS OF POVERTY CHAUCER ONLY REPRODUCES MUCH THAT HAD
BEEN SAID ALREADY IN THE TALES THAT PRECEDED SUCH AS THE
MERCHANT'S AND THE MAN OF LAW'S

WAS NEVER SUCH ANOTHER AS WAS HE
TO SPEAK OF STRENGTH AND THERETO HARDINESS COURAGE
BUT TO HIS WIVES TOLD HE HIS SECRE
THROUGH WHICH HE SLEW HIMSELF FOR WRETCHEDNESS
SAMPSON THIS NOBLE AND MIGHTY CHAMPION
WITHOUTE WEAPON SAVE HIS HANDES TWAY
HE SLEW AND ALL TO RENTE THE LION TORE TO PIECES
TOWARD HIS WEDDING WALKING BY THE WAY
HIS FALSE WIFE COULD HIM SO PLEASE AND PRAY
TILL SHE HIS COUNSEL KNEW AND SHE UNTRUE
UNTO HIS FOES HIS COUNSEL GAN BEWRAY
AND HIM FORSOOK AND TOOK ANOTHER NEW
THREE HUNDRED FOXES SAMPSON TOOK FOR IRE
AND ALL THEIR TAILES HE TOGETHER BAND
AND SET THE FOXES' TAILES ALL ON FIRE
FOR HE IN EVERY TAIL HAD KNIT A BRAND
AND THEY BURNT ALL THE COMBS OF THAT LEND
AND ALL THEIR OLIVERES AND VINES EKE
OLIVE TREES 4
A THOUSAND MEN HE SLEW EKE WITH HIS HAND
AND HAD NO WEAPON BUT AN ASS'S CHEEK
WHEN THEY WERE SLAIN SO THIRSTED HIM THAT HE
WAS WELL NIGH LORN FOR WHICH HE GAN TO PRAY NEAR TO PERISHING
THAT GOD WOULD ON HIS PAIN HAVE SOME PITY
AND SEND HIM DRINK OR ELLES MUST HE DIE
AND OF THIS ASS'S CHECK THAT WAS SO DRY
OUT OF A WANG TOOTH SPRANG ANON A WELL CHEEK TOOTH
OF WHICH HE DRANK ENOUGH SHORTLY TO SAY
THUS HELP'D HIM GOD AS JUDICUM 5 CAN TELL
BY VERY FORCE AT GAZA ON A NIGHT
MAUGRE THE PHILISTINES OF THAT CITY IN SPITE OF
THE GATES OF THE TOWN HE HATH UP PLIGHT PLUCKED WRENCHED
AND ON HIS BACK Y CARRIED THEM HATH HE
HIGH ON AN HILL WHERE AS MEN MIGHT THEM SEE
O NOBLE MIGHTY SAMPSON LEFE AND DEAR LOVED
HADST THOU NOT TOLD TO WOMEN THY SECRE
IN ALL THIS WORLD THERE HAD NOT BEEN THY PEER
THIS SAMPSON NEVER CIDER DRANK NOR WINE
NOR ON HIS HEAD CAME RAZOR NONE NOR SHEAR
BY PRECEPT OF THE MESSENGER DIVINE
FOR ALL HIS STRENGTHES IN HIS HAIRES WERE
AND FULLY TWENTY WINTERS YEAR BY YEAR
HE HAD OF ISRAEL THE GOVERNANCE
BUT SOONE SHALL HE WEEPE MANY A TEAR
FOR WOMEN SHALL HIM BRINGE TO MISCHANCE
UNTO HIS LEMAN DALILA HE TOLD MISTRESS
THAT IN HIS HAIRES ALL HIS STRENGTHE LAY
AND FALSELY TO HIS FOEMEN SHE HIM SOLD
AND SLEEPING IN HER BARME UPON A DAY LAP
SHE MADE TO CLIP OR SHEAR HIS HAIR AWAY
AND MADE HIS FOEMEN ALL HIS CRAFT ESPIEN
AND WHEN THEY FOUNDE HIM IN THIS ARRAY
THEY BOUND HIM FAST AND PUT OUT BOTH HIS EYEN
BUT ERE HIS HAIR WAS CLIPPED OR Y SHAVE
THERE WAS NO BOND WITH WHICH MEN MIGHT HIM BIND
BUT NOW IS HE IN PRISON IN A CAVE
WHERE AS THEY MADE HIM AT THE QUERNE GRIND
MILL 6
O NOBLE SAMPSON STRONGEST OF MANKIND
O WHILOM JUDGE IN GLORY AND RICHESS
NOW MAY'ST THOU WEEPE WITH THINE EYEN BLIND
SINCE THOU FROM WEAL ART FALL'N TO WRETCHEDNESS
TH'END OF THIS CAITIFF WAS AS I SHALL SAY WRETCHED MAN
HIS FOEMEN MADE A FEAST UPON A DAY
AND MADE HIM AS THEIR FOOL BEFORE THEM PLAY
AND THIS WAS IN A TEMPLE OF GREAT ARRAY
BUT AT THE LAST HE MADE A FOUL AFFRAY
FOR HE TWO PILLARS SHOOK AND MADE THEM FALL
AND DOWN FELL TEMPLE AND ALL AND THERE IT LAY
AND SLEW HIMSELF AND EKE HIS FOEMEN ALL
THIS IS TO SAY THE PRINCES EVERY ONE
AND EKE THREE THOUSAND BODIES WERE THERE SLAIN
WITH FALLING OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF STONE
OF SAMPSON NOW WILL I NO MORE SAYN
BEWARE BY THIS EXAMPLE OLD AND PLAIN
THAT NO MAN TELL HIS COUNSEL TO HIS WIFE
OF SUCH THING AS HE WOULD HAVE SECRET FAIN WISH TO BE SECRET
IF THAT IT TOUCH HIS LIMBES OR HIS LIFE
OF HERCULES THE SOV'REIGN CONQUEROUR
SINGE HIS WORKES' LAND AND HIGH RENOWN
FOR IN HIS TIME OF STRENGTH HE BARE THE FLOW'R
HE SLEW AND REFT THE SKIN OF THE LION
HE OF THE CENTAURS LAID THE BOAST ADOWN
HE HARPIES 7 SLEW THE CRUEL BIRDES FELL
HE GOLDEN APPLES REFT FROM THE DRAGON
HE DREW OUT CERBERUS THE HOUND OF HELL
HE SLEW THE CRUEL TYRANT BUSIRUS
8
AND MADE HIS HORSE TO FRET HIM FLESH AND BONE DEVOUR
HE SLEW THE FIERY SERPENT VENOMOUS
OF ACHELOUS' TWO HORNES BRAKE HE ONE
AND HE SLEW CACUS IN A CAVE OF STONE
HE SLEW THE GIANT ANTAEUS THE STRONG
HE SLEW THE GRISLY BOAR AND THAT ANON
AND BARE THE HEAV'N UPON HIS NECKE LONG
9
WAS NEVER WIGHT SINCE THAT THE WORLD BEGAN
THAT SLEW SO MANY MONSTERS AS DID HE
THROUGHOUT THE WIDE WORLD HIS NAME RAN
WHAT FOR HIS STRENGTH AND FOR HIS HIGH BOUNTE
AND EVERY REALME WENT HE FOR TO SEE
HE WAS SO STRONG THAT NO MAN MIGHT HIM LET WITHSTAND
AT BOTH THE WORLDE'S ENDS AS SAITH TROPHEE 10
INSTEAD OF BOUNDES HE A PILLAR SET
A LEMAN HAD THIS NOBLE CHAMPION
THAT HIGHTE DEJANIRA FRESH AS MAY
AND AS THESE CLERKES MAKE MENTION
SHE HATH HIM SENT A SHIRTE FRESH AND GAY
ALAS THIS SHIRT ALAS AND WELL AWAY
ENVENOMED WAS SUBTILLY WITHAL
THAT ERE THAT HE HAD WORN IT HALF A DAY
IT MADE HIS FLESH ALL FROM HIS BONES FALL
BUT NATHELESS SOME CLERKES HER EXCUSE
BY ONE THAT HIGHTE NESSUS THAT IT MAKED
BE AS HE MAY I WILL NOT HER ACCUSE
BUT ON HIS BACK THIS SHIRT HE WORE ALL NAKED
TILL THAT HIS FLESH WAS FOR THE VENOM BLAKED BLACKENED
AND WHEN HE SAW NONE OTHER REMEDY
IN HOTE COALS HE HATH HIMSELFE RAKED
FOR WITH NO VENOM DEIGNED HE TO DIE
THUS STERF THIS WORTHY MIGHTY HERCULES
DIED
LO WHO MAY TRUST ON FORTUNE ANY THROW FOR A MOMENT
FOR HIM THAT FOLLOWETH ALL THIS WORLD OF PRES NEAR 11
ERE HE BE WARE IS OFTEN LAID FULL LOW
FULL WISE IS HE THAT CAN HIMSELFE KNOW
BEWARE FOR WHEN THAT FORTUNE LIST TO GLOSE
THEN WAITETH SHE HER MAN TO OVERTHROW
BY SUCH A WAY AS HE WOULD LEAST SUPPOSE
THE MIGHTY THRONE THE PRECIOUS TREASOR
THE GLORIOUS SCEPTRE AND ROYAL MAJESTY
THAT HAD THE KING NABUCHODONOSOR
WITH TONGUE UNNETHES MAY DESCRIBED BE
SCARCELY
HE TWICE WON JERUSALEM THE CITY
THE VESSELS OF THE TEMPLE HE WITH HIM LAD TOOK AWAY
AT BABYLONE WAS HIS SOV'REIGN SEE SEAT
IN WHICH HIS GLORY AND DELIGHT HE HAD
THE FAIREST CHILDREN OF THE BLOOD ROYAL
OF ISRAEL HE DID DO GELD ANON CAUSED TO BE CASTRATED
AND MAKED EACH OF THEM TO BE HIS THRALL SLAVE
AMONGES OTHERS DANIEL WAS ONE
THAT WAS THE WISEST CHILD OF EVERY ONE
FOR HE THE DREAMES OF THE KING EXPOUNDED
WHERE IN CHALDAEA CLERKES WAS THERE NONE
THAT WISTE TO WHAT FINE HIS DREAMES SOUNDED
END
THIS PROUDE KING LET MAKE A STATUE OF GOLD
SIXTY CUBITES LONG AND SEVEN IN BREAD'
TO WHICH IMAGE HATHE YOUNG AND OLD
COMMANDED HE TO LOUT AND HAVE IN DREAD BOW DOWN TO
OR IN A FURNACE FULL OF FLAMES RED
HE SHOULD BE BURNT THAT WOULDE NOT OBEY
BUT NEVER WOULD ASSENTE TO THAT DEED
DANIEL NOR HIS YOUNGE FELLOWS TWAY
THIS KING OF KINGES PROUD WAS AND ELATE LOFTY
HE WEEN'D THAT GOD THAT SITS IN MAJESTY THOUGHT
MIGHTE HIM NOT BEREAVE OF HIS ESTATE
BUT SUDDENLY HE LOST HIS DIGNITY
AND LIKE A BEAST HE SEEMED FOR TO BE
AND ATE HAY AS AN OX AND LAY THEREOUT
IN RAIN WITH WILDE BEASTES WALKED HE
TILL CERTAIN TIME WAS Y COME ABOUT
AND LIKE AN EAGLE'S FEATHERS WAX'D HIS HAIRS
HIS NAILES LIKE A BIRDE'S CLAWES WERE
TILL GOD RELEASED HIM AT CERTAIN YEARS
AND GAVE HIM WIT AND THEN WITH MANY A TEAR
HE THANKED GOD AND EVER HIS LIFE IN FEAR
WAS HE TO DO AMISS OR MORE TRESPACE
AND TILL THAT TIME HE LAID WAS ON HIS BIER
HE KNEW THAT GOD WAS FULL OF MIGHT AND GRACE
HIS SONE WHICH THAT HIGHTE BALTHASAR
THAT HELD THE REGNE AFTER HIS FATHER'S DAY POSSESSED THE KINGDOM
HE BY HIS FATHER COULDE NOT BEWARE
FOR PROUD HE WAS OF HEART AND OF ARRAY
AND EKE AN IDOLASTER WAS HE AYE
HIS HIGH ESTATE ASSURED HIM IN PRIDE CONFIRMED
BUT FORTUNE CAST HIM DOWN AND THERE HE LAY
AND SUDDENLY HIS REGNE GAN DIVIDE
A FEAST HE MADE UNTO HIS LORDES ALL
UPON A TIME AND MADE THEM BLITHE BE
AND THEN HIS OFFICERES GAN HE CALL
GO BRINGE FORTH THE VESSELS SAIDE HE
WHICH THAT MY FATHER IN HIS PROSPERITY
OUT OF THE TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM REFT
AND TO OUR HIGHE GODDES THANKS WE
OF HONOUR THAT OUR ELDERS WITH US LEFT FOREFATHERS
HIS WIFE HIS LORDES AND HIS CONCUBINES
AYE DRANKE WHILE THEIR APPETITES DID LAST
OUT OF THESE NOBLE VESSELS SUNDRY WINES
AND ON A WALL THIS KING HIS EYEN CAST
AND SAW AN HAND ARMLESS THAT WROTE FULL FAST
FOR FEAR OF WHICH HE QUAKED AND SIGHED SORE
THIS HAND THAT BALTHASAR SO SORE AGHAST DISMAYED
WROTE MANE TEKEL PHARES AND NO MORE
IN ALL THAT LAND MAGICIAN WAS THERE NONE
THAT COULD EXPOUNDE WHAT THIS LETTER MEANT
BUT DANIEL EXPOUNDED IT ANON
AND SAID O KING GOD TO THY FATHER LENT
GLORY AND HONOUR REGNE TREASURE RENT REVENUE
AND HE WAS PROUD AND NOTHING GOD HE DRAD DREADED
AND THEREFORE GOD GREAT WRECHE UPON HIM SENT VENGEANCE
AND HIM BEREFT THE REGNE THAT HE HAD
HE WAS CAST OUT OF MANNE'S COMPANY
WITH ASSES WAS HIS HABITATION
AND ATE HAY AS A BEAST IN WET AND DRY
TILL THAT HE KNEW BY GRACE AND BY REASON
THAT GOD OF HEAVEN HATH DOMINATION
O'ER EVERY REGNE AND EVERY CREATURE
AND THEN HAD GOD OF HIM COMPASSION
AND HIM RESTOR'D HIS REGNE AND HIS FIGURE
EKE THOU THAT ART HIS SON ART PROUD ALSO
AND KNOWEST ALL THESE THINGES VERILY
AND ART REBEL TO GOD AND ART HIS FOE
THOU DRANKEST OF HIS VESSELS BOLDELY
THY WIFE EKE AND THY WENCHES SINFULLY
DRANK OF THE SAME VESSELS SUNDRY WINES
AND HERIED FALSE GODDES CURSEDLY PRAISED
THEREFORE TO THEE Y SHAPEN FULL GREAT PINE IS GREAT PUNISHMENT IS
PREPARED FOR THEE
THIS HAND WAS SENT FROM GOD THAT ON THE WALL
WROTE MANE TEKEL PHARES TRUSTE ME
THY REIGN IS DONE THOU WEIGHEST NAUGHT AT ALL
DIVIDED IS THY REGNE AND IT SHALL BE
TO MEDES AND TO PERSIANS GIV'N QUOTH HE
AND THILKE SAME NIGHT THIS KING WAS SLAW SLAIN
AND DARIUS OCCUPIED HIS DEGREE
THOUGH HE THERETO HAD NEITHER RIGHT NOR LAW
LORDINGS EXAMPLE HEREBY MAY YE TAKE
HOW THAT IN LORDSHIP IS NO SICKERNESS SECURITY
FOR WHEN THAT FORTUNE WILL A MAN FORSAKE
SHE BEARS AWAY HIS REGNE AND HIS RICHESS
AND EKE HIS FRIENDES BOTHE MORE AND LESS
FOR WHAT MAN THAT HATH FRIENDES THROUGH FORTUNE
MISHAP WILL MAKE THEM ENEMIES I GUESS
THIS PROVERB IS FULL SOOTH AND FULL COMMUNE
ZENOBIA OF PALMYRIE THE QUEEN 12
AS WRITE PERSIANS OF HER NOBLESS
SO WORTHY WAS IN ARMES AND SO KEEN
THAT NO WIGHT PASSED HER IN HARDINESS
NOR IN LINEAGE NOR OTHER GENTLENESS NOBLE QUALITIES
OF THE KING'S BLOOD OF PERSE IS SHE DESCENDED PERSIA
I SAY NOT THAT SHE HADDE MOST FAIRNESS
BUT OF HER SHAPE SHE MIGHT NOT HE AMENDED
FROM HER CHILDHOOD I FINDE THAT SHE FLED
OFFICE OF WOMAN AND TO WOODS SHE WENT
AND MANY A WILDE HARTE'S BLOOD SHE SHED
WITH ARROWS BROAD THAT SHE AGAINST THEM SENT
SHE WAS SO SWIFT THAT SHE ANON THEM HENT CAUGHT
AND WHEN THAT SHE WAS OLDER SHE WOULD KILL
LIONS LEOPARDS AND BEARES ALL TO RENT TORN TO PIECES
AND IN HER ARMES WIELD THEM AT HER WILL
SHE DURST THE WILDE BEASTES' DENNES SEEK
AND RUNNEN IN THE MOUNTAINS ALL THE NIGHT
AND SLEEP UNDER A BUSH AND SHE COULD EKE
WRESTLE BY VERY FORCE AND VERY MIGHT
WITH ANY YOUNG MAN WERE HE NE'ER SO WIGHT ACTIVE NIMBLE
THERE MIGHTE NOTHING IN HER ARMES STOND
SHE KEPT HER MAIDENHOOD FROM EVERY WIGHT
TO NO MAN DEIGNED SHE FOR TO BE BOND
BUT AT THE LAST HER FRIENDES HAVE HER MARRIED
TO ODENATE 13 A PRINCE OF THAT COUNTRY
ALL WERE IT SO THAT SHE THEM LONGE TARRIED
AND YE SHALL UNDERSTANDE HOW THAT HE
HADDE SUCH FANTASIES AS HADDE SHE
BUT NATHELESS WHEN THEY WERE KNIT IN FERE TOGETHER
THEY LIV'D IN JOY AND IN FELICITY
FOR EACH OF THEM HAD OTHER LEFE AND DEAR
LOVED
SAVE ONE THING THAT SHE NEVER WOULD ASSENT
BY NO WAY THAT HE SHOULDE BY HER LIE
BUT ONES FOR IT WAS HER PLAIN INTENT
TO HAVE A CHILD THE WORLD TO MULTIPLY
AND ALL SO SOON AS THAT SHE MIGHT ESPY
THAT SHE WAS NOT WITH CHILDE BY THAT DEED
THEN WOULD SHE SUFFER HIM DO HIS FANTASY
EFTSOON AND NOT BUT ONES OUT OF DREAD AGAIN WITHOUT DOUBT
AND IF SHE WERE WITH CHILD AT THILKE CAST THAT
NO MORE SHOULD HE PLAYE THILKE GAME
TILL FULLY FORTY DAYES WERE PAST
THEN WOULD SHE ONCE SUFFER HIM DO THE SAME
ALL WERE THIS ODENATUS WILD OR TAME WHETHER
HE GOT NO MORE OF HER FOR THUS SHE SAID
IT WAS TO WIVES LECHERY AND SHAME
IN OTHER CASE IF THAT MEN WITH THEM PLAY'D
ON OTHER TERMS
TWO SONES BY THIS ODENATE HAD SHE
THE WHICH SHE KEPT IN VIRTUE AND LETTRURE LEARNING
BUT NOW UNTO OUR TALE TURNE WE
I SAY SO WORSHIPFUL A CREATURE
AND WISE THEREWITH AND LARGE WITH MEASURE BOUNTIFUL MODERATION
SO PENIBLE IN THE WAR AND COURTEOUS EKE LABORIOUS
NOR MORE LABOUR MIGHT IN WAR ENDURE
WAS NONE THOUGH ALL THIS WORLDE MEN SHOULD SEEK
HER RICH ARRAY IT MIGHTE NOT BE TOLD
AS WELL IN VESSEL AS IN HER CLOTHING
SHE WAS ALL CLAD IN PIERRIE AND IN GOLD JEWELLERY
AND EKE SHE LEFTE NOT FOR NO HUNTING DID NOT NEGLECT
TO HAVE OF SUNDRY TONGUES FULL KNOWING
WHEN THAT SHE LEISURE HAD AND FOR T'INTEND APPLY
TO LEARNE BOOKES WAS ALL HER LIKING
HOW SHE IN VIRTUE MIGHT HER LIFE DISPEND
AND SHORTLY OF THIS STORY FOR TO TREAT
SO DOUGHTY WAS HER HUSBAND AND EKE SHE
THAT THEY CONQUERED MANY REGNES GREAT
IN TH'ORIENT WITH MANY A FAIR CITY
APPERTINENT UNTO THE MAJESTY
OF ROME AND WITH STRONG HANDE HELD THEM FAST
NOR EVER MIGHT THEIR FOEMEN DO THEM FLEE MAKE
AYE WHILE THAT ODENATUS' DAYES LAST'
HER BATTLES WHOSO LIST THEM FOR TO READ
AGAINST SAPOR THE KING 14 AND OTHER MO'
AND HOW THAT ALL THIS PROCESS FELL IN DEED
WHY SHE CONQUER'D AND WHAT TITLE THERETO
AND AFTER OF HER MISCHIEF AND HER WOE MISFORTUNE
HOW THAT SHE WAS BESIEGED AND Y TAKE
LET HIM UNTO MY MASTER PETRARCH GO
THAT WRITES ENOUGH OF THIS I UNDERTAKE
WHEN ODENATE WAS DEAD SHE MIGHTILY
THE REGNE HELD AND WITH HER PROPER HAND
AGAINST HER FOES SHE FOUGHT SO CRUELLY
THAT THERE N'AS KING NOR PRINCE IN ALL THAT LAND WAS NOT
THAT WAS NOT GLAD IF BE THAT GRACE FAND
THAT SHE WOULD NOT UPON HIS LAND WARRAY MAKE WAR
WITH HER THEY MADEN ALLIANCE BY BOND
TO BE IN PEACE AND LET HER RIDE AND PLAY
THE EMPEROR OF ROME CLAUDIUS
NOR HIM BEFORE THE ROMAN GALLIEN
DURSTE NEVER BE SO COURAGEOUS
NOR NO ARMENIAN NOR EGYPTIEN
NOR SYRIAN NOR NO ARABIEN
WITHIN THE FIELDE DURSTE WITH HER FIGHT
LEST THAT SHE WOULD THEM WITH HER HANDES SLEN SLAY
OR WITH HER MEINIE PUTTE THEM TO FLIGHT
TROOPS
IN KINGES' HABIT WENT HER SONES TWO
AS HEIRES OF THEIR FATHER'S REGNES ALL
AND HEREMANNO AND TIMOLAO
THEIR NAMES WERE AS PERSIANS THEM CALL
BUT AYE FORTUNE HATH IN HER HONEY GALL
THIS MIGHTY QUEENE MAY NO WHILE ENDURE
FORTUNE OUT OF HER REGNE MADE HER FALL
TO WRETCHEDNESS AND TO MISADVENTURE
AURELIAN WHEN THAT THE GOVERNANCE
OF ROME CAME INTO HIS HANDES TWAY 15
HE SHOPE UPON THIS QUEEN TO DO VENGEANCE PREPARED
AND WITH HIS LEGIONS HE TOOK HIS WAY
TOWARD ZENOBIE AND SHORTLY FOR TO SAY
HE MADE HER FLEE AND AT THE LAST HER HENT TOOK
AND FETTER'D HER AND EKE HER CHILDREN TWAY
AND WON THE LAND AND HOME TO ROME HE WENT
AMONGES OTHER THINGES THAT HE WAN
HER CAR THAT WAS WITH GOLD WROUGHT AND PIERRIE JEWELS
THIS GREATE ROMAN THIS AURELIAN
HATH WITH HIM LED FOR THAT MEN SHOULD IT SEE
BEFORE IN HIS TRIUMPHE WALKED SHE
WITH GILTE CHAINS UPON HER NECK HANGING
CROWNED SHE WAS AS AFTER HER DEGREE ACCORDING TO
AND FULL OF PIERRIE HER CLOTHING
ALAS FORTUNE SHE THAT WHILOM WAS
DREADFUL TO KINGES AND TO EMPEROURS
NOW GALETH ALL THE PEOPLE ON HER ALAS YELLETH
AND SHE THAT HELMED WAS IN STARKE STOWRES WORE A HELMET IN
AND WON BY FORCE TOWNES STRONG AND TOW'RS OBSTINATE BATTLES
SHALL ON HER HEAD NOW WEAR A VITREMITE 16
AND SHE THAT BARE THE SCEPTRE FULL OF FLOW'RS
SHALL BEAR A DISTAFF HER COST FOR TO QUITE TO MAKE HER LIVING
ALTHOUGH THAT NERO WERE SO VICIOUS
AS ANY FIEND THAT LIES FULL LOW ADOWN
YET HE AS TELLETH US SUETONIUS 17
THIS WIDE WORLD HAD IN SUBJECTIOUN
BOTH EAST AND WEST SOUTH AND SEPTENTRIOUN
OF RUBIES SAPPHIRES AND OF PEARLES WHITE
WERE ALL HIS CLOTHES EMBROIDER'D UP AND DOWN
FOR HE IN GEMMES GREATLY GAN DELIGHT
MORE DELICATE MORE POMPOUS OF ARRAY
MORE PROUD WAS NEVER EMPEROR THAN HE
THAT ILKE CLOTH THAT HE HAD WORN ONE DAY SAME ROBE
AFTER THAT TIME HE WOULD IT NEVER SEE
NETTES OF GOLD THREAD HAD HE GREAT PLENTY
TO FISH IN TIBER WHEN HIM LIST TO PLAY
HIS LUSTES WERE AS LAW IN HIS DEGREE PLEASURES
FOR FORTUNE AS HIS FRIEND WOULD HIM OBEY
HE ROME BURNT FOR HIS DELICACY PLEASURE
THE SENATORS HE SLEW UPON A DAY
TO HEARE HOW THAT MEN WOULD WEEP AND CRY
AND SLEW HIS BROTHER AND BY HIS SISTER LAY
HIS MOTHER MADE HE IN PITEOUS ARRAY
FOR HE HER WOMBE SLITTE TO BEHOLD
WHERE HE CONCEIVED WAS SO WELL AWAY
THAT HE SO LITTLE OF HIS MOTHER TOLD VALUED
NO TEAR OUT OF HIS EYEN FOR THAT SIGHT
CAME BUT HE SAID A FAIR WOMAN WAS SHE
GREAT WONDER IS HOW THAT HE COULD OR MIGHT
BE DOOMESMAN OF HER DEADE BEAUTY JUDGE
THE WINE TO BRINGE HIM COMMANDED HE
AND DRANK ANON NONE OTHER WOE HE MADE
WHEN MIGHT IS JOINED UNTO CRUELTY
ALAS TOO DEEPE WILL THE VENOM WADE
IN YOUTH A MASTER HAD THIS EMPEROUR
TO TEACHE HIM LETTRURE AND COURTESY LITERATURE LEARNING
FOR OF MORALITY HE WAS THE FLOW'R
AS IN HIS TIME BUT IF BOOKES LIE
UNLESS
AND WHILE THIS MASTER HAD OF HIM MAST'RY
HE MADE HIM SO CONNING AND SO SOUPLE SUBTLE
THAT LONGE TIME IT WAS ERE TYRANNY
OR ANY VICE DURST IN HIM UNCOUPLE BE LET LOOSE
THIS SENECA OF WHICH THAT I DEVISE TELL
BECAUSE NERO HAD OF HIM SUCHE DREAD
FOR HE FROM VICES WOULD HIM AYE CHASTISE
DISCREETLY AS BY WORD AND NOT BY DEED
SIR HE WOULD SAY AN EMPEROR MUST NEED
BE VIRTUOUS AND HATE TYRANNY
FOR WHICH HE MADE HIM IN A BATH TO BLEED
ON BOTH HIS ARMES TILL HE MUSTE DIE
THIS NERO HAD EKE OF A CUSTUMANCE HABIT
IN YOUTH AGAINST HIS MASTER FOR TO RISE STAND IN HIS PRESENCE
WHICH AFTERWARD HE THOUGHT A GREAT GRIEVANCE
THEREFORE HE MADE HIM DIEN IN THIS WISE
BUT NATHELESS THIS SENECA THE WISE
CHOSE IN A BATH TO DIE IN THIS MANNERE
RATHER THAN HAVE ANOTHER TORMENTISE TORTURE
AND THUS HATH NERO SLAIN HIS MASTER DEAR
NOW FELL IT SO THAT FORTUNE LIST NO LONGER
THE HIGHE PRIDE OF NERO TO CHERICE CHERISH
FOR THOUGH HE WERE STRONG YET WAS SHE STRONGER
SHE THOUGHTE THUS BY GOD I AM TOO NICE FOOLISH
TO SET A MAN THAT IS FULL FILL'D OF VICE
IN HIGH DEGREE AND EMPEROR HIM CALL
BY GOD OUT OF HIS SEAT I WILL HIM TRICE THRUST 18
WHEN HE LEAST WEENETH SOONEST SHALL HE FALL EXPECTETH
THE PEOPLE ROSE UPON HIM ON A NIGHT
FOR HIS DEFAULT AND WHEN HE IT ESPIED
OUT OF HIS DOORS ANON HE HATH HIM DIGHT BETAKEN HIMSELF
ALONE AND WHERE HE WEEN'D T'HAVE BEEN ALLIED REGARDED WITH
HE KNOCKED FAST AND AYE THE MORE HE CRIED FRIENDSHIP
THE FASTER SHUTTE THEY THEIR DOORES ALL
THEN WIST HE WELL HE HAD HIMSELF MISGIED MISLED
AND WENT HIS WAY NO LONGER DURST HE CALL
THE PEOPLE CRIED AND RUMBLED UP AND DOWN
THAT WITH HIS EARES HEARD HE HOW THEY SAID
WHERE IS THIS FALSE TYRANT THIS NEROUN
FOR FEAR ALMOST OUT OF HIS WIT HE BRAID WENT
AND TO HIS GODDES PITEOUSLY HE PRAY'D
FOR SUCCOUR BUT IT MIGHTE NOT BETIDE
FOR DREAD OF THIS HE THOUGHTE THAT DIED
AND RAN INTO A GARDEN HIM TO HIDE
AND IN THIS GARDEN FOUND HE CHURLES TWAY
THAT SATTE BY A FIRE GREAT AND RED
AND TO THESE CHURLES TWO HE GAN TO PRAY
TO SLAY HIM AND TO GIRDON OFF HIS HEAD STRIKE
THAT TO HIS BODY WHEN THAT HE WERE DEAD
WERE NO DESPITE DONE FOR HIS DEFAME INFAMY
HIMSELF HE SLEW HE COUD NO BETTER REDE HE KNEW NO BETTER
OF WHICH FORTUNE LAUGH'D AND HADDE GAME
COUNSEL
WAS NEVER CAPITAIN UNDER A KING
THAT REGNES MORE PUT IN SUBJECTIOUN
NOR STRONGER WAS IN FIELD OF ALLE THING
AS IN HIS TIME NOR GREATER OF RENOWN
NOR MORE POMPOUS IN HIGH PRESUMPTIOUN
THAN HOLOFERNES WHOM FORTUNE AYE KISS'D
SO LIK'ROUSLY AND LED HIM UP AND DOWN
TILL THAT HIS HEAD WAS OFF ERE THAT HE WIST BEFORE HE KNEW IT
NOT ONLY THAT THIS WORLD HAD OF HIM AWE
FOR LOSING OF RICHESS AND LIBERTY
BUT HE MADE EVERY MAN RENY HIS LAW RENOUNCE HIS RELIGION 19
NABUCHODONOSOR WAS GOD SAID HE
NONE OTHER GODDE SHOULD HONOURED BE
AGAINST HIS HEST THERE DARE NO WIGHT TRESPACE COMMAND
SAVE IN BETHULIA A STRONG CITY
WHERE ELIACHIM PRIEST WAS OF THAT PLACE
BUT TAKE KEEP OF THE DEATH OF HOLOFERN NOTICE
AMID HIS HOST HE DRUNKEN LAY AT NIGHT
WITHIN HIS TENTE LARGE AS IS A BERN BARN
AND YET FOR ALL HIS POMP AND ALL HIS MIGHT
JUDITH A WOMAN AS HE LAY UPRIGHT
SLEEPING HIS HEAD OFF SMOTE AND FROM HIS TENT
FULL PRIVILY SHE STOLE FROM EVERY WIGHT
AND WITH HIS HEAD UNTO HER TOWN SHE WENT
WHAT NEEDETH IT OF KING ANTIOCHUS 20
TO TELL HIS HIGH AND ROYAL MAJESTY
HIS GREAT PRIDE AND HIS WORKES VENOMOUS
FOR SUCH ANOTHER WAS THERE NONE AS HE
READE WHAT THAT HE WAS IN MACCABEE
AND READ THE PROUDE WORDES THAT HE SAID
AND WHY HE FELL FROM HIS PROSPERITY
AND IN AN HILL HOW WRETCHEDLY HE DIED
FORTUNE HIM HAD ENHANCED SO IN PRIDE
THAT VERILY HE WEEN'D HE MIGHT ATTAIN
UNTO THE STARRES UPON EVERY SIDE
AND IN A BALANCE WEIGHEN EACH MOUNTAIN
AND ALL THE FLOODES OF THE SEA RESTRAIN
AND GODDE'S PEOPLE HAD HE MOST IN HATE
THEM WOULD HE SLAY IN TORMENT AND IN PAIN
WEENING THAT GOD MIGHT NOT HIS PRIDE ABATE
AND FOR THAT NICANOR AND TIMOTHEE
WITH JEWES WERE VANQUISH'D MIGHTILY 21
UNTO THE JEWES SUCH AN HATE HAD HE
THAT HE BADE GRAITH HIS CAR FULL HASTILY PREPARE HIS CHARIOT
AND SWORE AND SAIDE FULL DISPITEOUSLY
UNTO JERUSALEM HE WOULD EFTSOON IMMEDIATELY
TO WREAK HIS IRE ON IT FULL CRUELLY
BUT OF HIS PURPOSE WAS HE LET FULL SOON
PREVENTED
GOD FOR HIS MENACE HIM SO SORE SMOTE
WITH INVISIBLE WOUND INCURABLE
THAT IN HIS GUTTES CARF IT SO AND BOTE CUT GNAWED
TILL THAT HIS PAINES WERE IMPORTABLE UNENDURABLE
AND CERTAINLY THE WRECHE WAS REASONABLE VENGEANCE
FOR MANY A MANNE'S GUTTES DID HE PAIN
BUT FROM HIS PURPOSE CURS'D AND DAMNABLE IMPIOUS
FOR ALL HIS SMART HE WOULD HIM NOT RESTRAIN
BUT BADE ANON APPARAILE HIS HOST
PREPARE
AND SUDDENLY ERE HE WAS OF IT WARE
GOD DAUNTED ALL HIS PRIDE AND ALL HIS BOAST
FOR HE SO SORE FELL OUT OF HIS CHARE CHARIOT
THAT IT HIS LIMBES AND HIS SKIN TO TARE
SO THAT HE NEITHER MIGHTE GO NOR RIDE
BUT IN A CHAIRE MEN ABOUT HIM BARE
ALLE FORBRUISED BOTHE BACK AND SIDE
THE WRECHE OF GOD HIM SMOTE SO CRUELLY VENGEANCE
THAT THROUGH HIS BODY WICKED WORMES CREPT
AND THEREWITHAL HE STANK SO HORRIBLY
THAT NONE OF ALL HIS MEINIE THAT HIM KEPT SERVANTS
WHETHER SO THAT HE WOKE OR ELLES SLEPT
NE MIGHTE NOT OF HIM THE STINK ENDURE
IN THIS MISCHIEF HE WAILED AND EKE WEPT
AND KNEW GOD LORD OF EVERY CREATURE
TO ALL HIS HOST AND TO HIMSELF ALSO
FULL WLATSEM WAS THE STINK OF HIS CARRAIN LOATHSOME BODY
NO MANNE MIGHT HIM BEARE TO AND FRO
AND IN THIS STINK AND THIS HORRIBLE PAIN
HE STARF FULL WRETCHEDLY IN A MOUNTAIN
DIES
THUS HATH THIS ROBBER AND THIS HOMICIDE
THAT MANY A MANNE MADE TO WEEP AND PLAIN
SUCH GUERDON AS BELONGETH UNTO PRIDE
REWARD
THE STORY OF ALEXANDER IS SO COMMUNE
THAT EV'RY WIGHT THAT HATH DISCRETION
HATH HEARD SOMEWHAT OR ALL OF HIS FORTUNE
THIS WIDE WORLD AS IN CONCLUSION
HE WON BY STRENGTH OR FOR HIS HIGH RENOWN
THEY WERE GLAD FOR PEACE TO HIM TO SEND
THE PRIDE AND BOAST OF MAN HE LAID ADOWN
WHERESO HE CAME UNTO THE WORLDE'S END
COMPARISON YET NEVER MIGHT BE MAKED
BETWEEN HIM AND ANOTHER CONQUEROR
FOR ALL THIS WORLD FOR DREAD OF HIM HAD QUAKED
HE WAS OF KNIGHTHOOD AND OF FREEDOM FLOW'R
FORTUNE HIM MADE THE HEIR OF HER HONOUR
SAVE WINE AND WOMEN NOTHING MIGHT ASSUAGE
HIS HIGH INTENT IN ARMS AND LABOUR
SO WAS HE FULL OF LEONINE COURAGE
WHAT PRAISE WERE IT TO HIM THOUGH I YOU TOLD
OF DARIUS AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND MO'
OF KINGES PRINCES DUKES AND EARLES BOLD
WHICH HE CONQUER'D AND BROUGHT THEM INTO WOE
I SAY AS FAR AS MAN MAY RIDE OR GO
THE WORLD WAS HIS WHY SHOULD I MORE DEVISE TELL
FOR THOUGH I WROTE OR TOLD YOU EVERMO'
OF HIS KNIGHTHOOD IT MIGHTE NOT SUFFICE
TWELVE YEARS HE REIGNED AS SAITH MACCABEE
PHILIPPE'S SON OF MACEDON HE WAS
THAT FIRST WAS KING IN GREECE THE COUNTRY
O WORTHY GENTLE ALEXANDER ALAS NOBLE

EMPOISON'D OF THINE OWEN FOLK THOU WERE

THAT ALL THIS WORLDE HAD IN HIS DEMAINE DOMINION
AND YET HE THOUGHT IT MIGHTE NOT SUFFICE
SO FULL WAS HIS CORAGE OF HIGH EMPRISE SPIRIT
ALAS WHO SHALL ME HELPE TO INDITE
FALSE FORTUNE AND POISON TO DESPISE
THE WHICHE TWO OF ALL THIS WOE I WITE BLAME
BY WISDOM MANHOOD AND BY GREAT LABOUR
FROM HUMBLENESS TO ROYAL MAJESTY
UP ROSE HE JULIUS THE CONQUEROUR
THAT WON ALL TH' OCCIDENT BY LAND AND SEA WEST
BY STRENGTH OF HAND OR ELLES BY TREATY
AND UNTO ROME MADE THEM TRIBUTARY
AND SINCE OF ROME THE EMPEROR WAS HE AFTERWARDS
TILL THAT FORTUNE WAX'D HIS ADVERSARY
O MIGHTY CAESAR THAT IN THESSALY
AGAINST POMPEIUS FATHER THINE IN LAW 23
THAT OF TH' ORIENT HAD ALL THE CHIVALRY
AS FAR AS THAT THE DAY BEGINS TO DAW
THAT THROUGH THY KNIGHTHOOD HAST THEM TAKE AND SLAW SLAIN
SAVE FEWE FOLK THAT WITH POMPEIUS FLED
THROUGH WHICH THOU PUT ALL TH' ORIENT IN AWE 24
THANKE FORTUNE THAT SO WELL THEE SPED

TO ROME AGAIN REPAIRED JULIUS
WITH HIS TRIUMPHE LAUREATE FULL HIGH
BUT ON A TIME BRUTUS AND CASSIUS
THAT EVER HAD OF HIS ESTATE ENVY
FULL PRIVILY HAVE MADE CONSPIRACY
AGAINST THIS JULIUS IN SUBTLE WISE
AND CAST THE PLACE IN WHICH HE SHOULDE DIE ARRANGED
WITH BODEKINS AS I SHALL YOU DEVISE DAGGERS TELL
THIS JULIUS TO THE CAPITOLE WENT
UPON A DAY AS HE WAS WONT TO GON
AND IN THE CAPITOL ANON HIM HENT SEIZED
THIS FALSE BRUTUS AND HIS OTHER FONE FOES
AND STICKED HIM WITH BODEKINS ANON
WITH MANY A WOUND AND THUS THEY LET HIM LIE
BUT NEVER GROAN'D HE AT NO STROKE BUT ONE
OR ELSE AT TWO BUT IF THE STORY LIE
UNLESS
SO MANLY WAS THIS JULIUS OF HEART
AND SO WELL LOVED ESTATELY HONESTY DIGNIFIED PROPRIETY
THAT THOUGH HIS DEADLY WOUNDES SORE SMART PAINED HIM
HIS MANTLE O'ER HIS HIPPES CASTE HE
THAT NE MAN SHOULDE SEE HIS PRIVITY
AND AS HE LAY A DYING IN A TRANCE
AND WISTE VERILY THAT DEAD WAS HE
OF HONESTY YET HAD HE REMEMBRANCE
LUCAN TO THEE THIS STORY I RECOMMEND
AND TO SUETON' AND VALERIE ALSO
THAT OF THIS STORY WRITE WORD AND END THE WHOLE 25
HOW THAT TO THESE GREAT CONQUERORES TWO
FORTUNE WAS FIRST A FRIEND AND SINCE A FOE
AFTERWARDS
NO MANNE TRUST UPON HER FAVOUR LONG
BUT HAVE HER IN AWAIT FOR EVERMO' EVER BE WATCHFUL AGAINST HER
WITNESS ON ALL THESE CONQUERORES STRONG
THE RICHE CROESUS 26 WHILOM KING OF LYDE
OF WHICH CROESUS CYRUS HIM SORE DRAD DREADED
YET WAS HE CAUGHT AMIDDES ALL HIS PRIDE
AND TO BE BURNT MEN TO THE FIRE HIM LAD
BUT SUCH A RAIN DOWN FROM THE WELKIN SHAD POURED FROM THE SKY
THAT SLEW THE FIRE AND MADE HIM TO ESCAPE
BUT TO BEWARE NO GRACE YET HE HAD
TILL FORTUNE ON THE GALLOWS MADE HIM GAPE
WHEN HE ESCAPED WAS HE COULD NOT STINT REFRAIN
FOR TO BEGIN A NEWE WAR AGAIN
HE WEENED WELL FOR THAT FORTUNE HIM SENT
SUCH HAP THAT HE ESCAPED THROUGH THE RAIN
THAT OF HIS FOES HE MIGHTE NOT BE SLAIN
AND EKE A SWEVEN ON A NIGHT HE METTE DREAM DREAMED
OF WHICH HE WAS SO PROUD AND EKE SO FAIN GLAD
THAT HE IN VENGEANCE ALL HIS HEARTE SET
UPON A TREE HE WAS SET AS HE THOUGHT
WHERE JUPITER HIM WASH'D BOTH BACK AND SIDE
AND PHOEBUS EKE A FAIR TOWEL HIM BROUGHT
TO DRY HIM WITH AND THEREFORE WAX'D HIS PRIDE
AND TO HIS DAUGHTER THAT STOOD HIM BESIDE
WHICH HE KNEW IN HIGH SCIENCE TO ABOUND
HE BADE HER TELL HIM WHAT IT SIGNIFIED
AND SHE HIS DREAM BEGAN RIGHT THUS EXPOUND
THE TREE QUOTH SHE THE GALLOWS IS TO MEAN
AND JUPITER BETOKENS SNOW AND RAIN
AND PHOEBUS WITH HIS TOWEL CLEAR AND CLEAN
THESE BE THE SUNNE'S STREAMES SOOTH TO SAYN RAYS
THOU SHALT Y HANGETH BE FATHER CERTAIN
RAIN SHALL THEE WASH AND SUNNE SHALL THEE DRY
THUS WARNED HIM FULL PLAT AND EKE FULL PLAIN
HIS DAUGHTER WHICH THAT CALLED WAS PHANIE
AND HANGED WAS CROESUS THE PROUDE KING
HIS ROYAL THRONE MIGHT HIM NOT AVAIL
TRAGEDY IS NONE OTHER MANNER THING
NOR CAN IN SINGING CRIEN NOR BEWAIL
BUT FOR THAT FORTUNE ALL DAY WILL ASSAIL
WITH UNWARE STROKE THE REGNES THAT BE PROUD 27 KINGDOMS
FOR WHEN MEN TRUSTE HER THEN WILL SHE FAIL
AND COVER HER BRIGHT FACE WITH A CLOUD

THE ELDEST SCARCELY FIVE YEARS WAS OF AGE
ALAS FORTUNE IT WAS GREAT CRUELTY
SUCH BIRDES FOR TO PUT IN SUCH A CAGE

HAD ON HIM MADE A FALSE SUGGESTION
THROUGH WHICH THE PEOPLE GAN UPON HIM RISE
AND PUT HIM IN PRISON IN SUCH A WISE
AS YE HAVE HEARD AND MEAT AND DRINK HE HAD
SO SMALL THAT WELL UNNETH IT MIGHT SUFFICE SCARCELY
AND THEREWITHAL IT WAS FULL POOR AND BAD

FROM POINT TO POINT NOT ONE WORD WILL HE FAIL
NOTES TO THE MONK'S TALE
1
THE MONK'S TALE IS FOUNDED IN ITS MAIN FEATURES ON
BOCCCACIO'S WORK DE CASIBUS VIRORUM ILLUSTRIUM STORIES
OF ILLUSTRIOUS MEN BUT CHAUCER HAS TAKEN THE SEPARATE STORIES
OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED FROM DIFFERENT AUTHORS AND DEALT WITH
THEM AFTER HIS OWN FASHION

BOCCACCIO OPENS HIS BOOK WITH ADAM WHOSE STORY IS TOLD AT

HERCULES WAS SEIZED BOUND AND LED

THE FEATS OF HERCULES HERE RECORDED ARE NOT ALL THESE KNOWN
AS THE TWELVE LABOURS FOR INSTANCE THE CLEANSING OF THE
AUGEAN STABLES AND THE CAPTURE OF HIPPOLYTE'S GIRDLE ARE NOT IN
THIS LIST OTHER AND LESS FAMOUS DEEDS OF THE HERO TAKING THEIR
PLACE
FOR THIS HOWEVER WE MUST ACCUSE NOT CHAUCER BUT
BOETHIUS WHOM HE HAS ALMOST LITERALLY TRANSLATED THOUGH WITH
SOME CHANGE OF ORDER
10
TROPHEE ONE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS HAS A MARGINAL REFERENCE
TO TROPHEUS VATES CHALDAEORUM TROPHEUS THE PROPHET OF
THE CHALDEES BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN WHAT AUTHOR CHAUCER MEANT
UNLESS THE REFERENCE IS TO A PASSAGE IN THE FILOSTRATO OF
BOCCACCIO ON WHICH CHAUCER FOUNDED HIS TROILUS AND
CRESSIDA AND WHICH LYDGATE MENTIONS UNDER THE NAME OF
TROPHE AS HAVING BEEN TRANSLATED BY CHAUCER
11

WORK DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS OF ILLUSTRIOUS WOMEN

ODENATUS WHO FOR HIS SERVICES TO THE ROMANS RECEIVED
FROM GALLIENUS THE TITLE OF AUGUSTUS HE WAS ASSASSINATED IN

26
AT THE OPENING OF THE STORY OF CROESUS CHAUCER HAS COPIED
FROM HIS OWN TRANSLATION OF BOETHIUS BUT THE STORY IS MAINLY
TAKEN FROM THE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE
27
THIS REFLECTION SAYS TYRWHTTT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
SUGGESTED BY ONE WHICH FOLLOWS SOON AFTER THE MENTION OF
CROESUS IN THE PASSAGE JUST CITED FROM BOETHIUS
'WHAT OTHER
THING BEWAIL THE CRYINGS OF TRAGEDIES BUT ONLY THE DEEDS OF
FORTUNE THAT WITH AN AWKWARD STROKE OVERTURNETH THE REALMS OF
GREAT NOBLEY IN SOME MANUSCRIPTS THE FOUR TRAGEDIES THAT
FOLLOW ARE PLACED BETWEEN THOSE OF ZENOBIA AND NERO BUT
ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL REFLECTION WITH WHICH THE TRAGEDY OF
CROESUS CLOSES MIGHT MOST APPROPRIATELY WIND UP THE WHOLE
SERIES THE GENERAL CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH IS OBSERVED
IN THE OTHER CASES RECOMMENDS THE ORDER FOLLOWED IN THE TEXT
BESIDES SINCE LIKE SEVERAL OTHER TALES THE MONK'S TRAGEDIES
WERE CUT SHORT BY THE IMPATIENCE OF THE AUDITORS IT IS MORE
NATURAL THAT THE TALE SHOULD CLOSE ABRUPTLY THAN BY SUCH A
RHETORICAL FINISH AS THESE LINES AFFORD
28
PEDRO THE CRUEL KING OF ARAGON AGAINST WHOM HIS BROTHER
HENRY REBELLED
HE WAS BY FALSE PRETENCES INVEIGLED INTO HIS
BROTHER'S TENT AND TREACHEROUSLY SLAIN
MR WRIGHT HAS REMARKED
THAT THE CAUSE OF PEDRO THOUGH HE WAS NO BETTER THAN A CRUEL
AND RECKLESS TYRANT WAS POPULAR IN ENGLAND FROM THE VERY
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT PRINCE EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE HAD
EMBARKED IN IT
29
NOT THE OLIVER OF CHARLEMAGNE BUT A TRAITOROUS OLIVER OF
ARMORICA CORRUPTED BY A BRIBE
GANILION WAS THE BETRAYER OF
THE CHRISTIAN ARMY AT RONCEVALLES SEE NOTE 9 TO THE SHIPMAN'S
TALE AND HIS NAME APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME USED IN
FRANCE TO DENOTE A TRAITOR
DUGUESCLIN WHO BETRAYED PEDRO INTO
HIS BROTHER'S TENT SEEMS TO BE INTENDED BY THE TERM GANILION
OLIVER BUT IF SO CHAUCER HAS MISTAKEN HIS NAME WHICH WAS
BERTRAND PERHAPS CONFOUNDING HIM AS TYRWHTTT SUGGESTS
WITH OLIVER DU CLISSON ANOTHER ILLUSTRIOUS BRETON OF THOSE
TIMES WHO WAS ALSO CONSTABLE OF FRANCE AFTER DUGUESCLIN
THE
ARMS OF THE LATTER ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DESCRIBED A LITTLE ABOVE
30
PIERRE DE LUSIGNAN KING OF CYPRUS WHO CAPTURED
ALEXANDRIA IN 1363 SEE NOTE 6 TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE TALES
HE WAS ASSASSINATED IN 1369
31
BERNABO VISCONTI DUKE OF MILAN WAS DEPOSED AND
IMPRISONED BY HIS NEPHEW AND DIED A CAPTIVE IN 1385
HIS DEATH
IS THE LATEST HISTORICAL FACT MENTIONED IN THE TALES AND THUS IT
THROWS THE DATE OF THEIR COMPOSITION TO ABOUT THE SIXTIETH YEAR
OF CHAUCER'S AGE
32
THE STORY OF UGOLINO IS TOLD IN THE 33RD CANTO OF THE
INFERNO

THE PROLOGUE
HO QUOTH THE KNIGHT GOOD SIR NO MORE OF THIS
THAT YE HAVE SAID IS RIGHT ENOUGH Y WIS OF A SURETY
AND MUCHE MORE FOR LITTLE HEAVINESS
IS RIGHT ENOUGH TO MUCHE FOLK I GUESS
I SAY FOR ME IT IS A GREAT DISEASE SOURCE OF DISTRESS ANNOYANCE
WHERE AS MEN HAVE BEEN IN GREAT WEALTH AND EASE
TO HEAREN OF THEIR SUDDEN FALL ALAS
AND THE CONTRARY IS JOY AND GREAT SOLAS DELIGHT COMFORT
AS WHEN A MAN HATH BEEN IN POOR ESTATE
AND CLIMBETH UP AND WAXETH FORTUNATE
AND THERE ABIDETH IN PROSPERITY
SUCH THING IS GLADSOME AS IT THINKETH ME
AND OF SUCH THING WERE GOODLY FOR TO TELL
YEA QUOTH OUR HOSTE BY SAINT PAULE'S BELL
YE SAY RIGHT SOOTH THIS MONK HATH CLAPPED LOUD TALKED
HE SPAKE HOW FORTUNE COVER'D WITH A CLOUD
I WOT NOT WHAT AND ALS' OF A TRAGEDY
RIGHT NOW YE HEARD AND PARDIE NO REMEDY
IT IS FOR TO BEWAILE NOR COMPLAIN
THAT THAT IS DONE AND ALSO IT IS PAIN
AS YE HAVE SAID TO HEAR OF HEAVINESS
SIR MONK NO MORE OF THIS SO GOD YOU BLESS
YOUR TALE ANNOYETH ALL THIS COMPANY
SUCH TALKING IS NOT WORTH A BUTTERFLY
FOR THEREIN IS THERE NO SPORT NOR GAME
THEREFORE SIR MONKE DAN PIERS BY YOUR NAME
I PRAY YOU HEART'LY TELL US SOMEWHAT ELSE
FOR SICKERLY N'ERE CLINKING OF YOUR BELLS WERE IT NOT FOR THE
THAT ON YOUR BRIDLE HANG ON EVERY SIDE
BY HEAVEN'S KING THAT FOR US ALLE DIED
I SHOULD ERE THIS HAVE FALLEN DOWN FOR SLEEP
ALTHOUGH THE SLOUGH HAD BEEN NEVER SO DEEP
THEN HAD YOUR TALE BEEN ALL TOLD IN VAIN
FOR CERTAINLY AS THESE CLERKES SAYN
WHERE AS A MAN MAY HAVE NO AUDIENCE
NOUGHT HELPETH IT TO TELLE HIS SENTENCE
AND WELL I WOT THE SUBSTANCE IS IN ME
IF ANYTHING SHALL WELL REPORTED BE
SIR SAY SOMEWHAT OF HUNTING 1 I YOU PRAY
NAY QUOTH THE MONK I HAVE NO LUST TO PLAY NO FONDNESS FOR
NOW LET ANOTHER TELL AS I HAVE TOLD JESTING
THEN SPAKE OUR HOST WITH RUDE SPEECH AND BOLD
AND SAID UNTO THE NUNNE'S PRIEST ANON
COME NEAR THOU PRIEST COME HITHER THOU SIR JOHN 2
TELL US SUCH THING AS MAY OUR HEARTES GLADE GLADDEN
BE BLITHE ALTHOUGH THOU RIDE UPON A JADE
WHAT THOUGH THINE HORSE BE BOTHE FOUL AND LEAN

LOOK THAT THINE HEART BE MERRY EVERMO'
YES HOST QUOTH HE SO MAY I RIDE OR GO
BUT I BE MERRY Y WIS I WILL BE BLAMED UNLESS
AND RIGHT ANON HIS TALE HE HATH ATTAMED COMMENCED 3
AND THUS HE SAID UNTO US EVERY ONE
THIS SWEETE PRIEST THIS GOODLY MAN SIR JOHN
NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE NUN'S PRIEST'S TALE
1
THE REQUEST IS JUSTIFIED BY THE DESCRIPTION OF MONK IN THE
PROLOGUE AS AN OUT RIDER THAT LOVED VENERY
2
ON THIS TYRWHITT REMARKS I KNOW NOT HOW IT HAS HAPPENED
THAT IN THE PRINCIPAL MODERN LANGUAGES JOHN OR ITS EQUIVALENT
IS A NAME OF CONTEMPT OR AT LEAST OF SLIGHT
SO THE ITALIANS USE
'GIANNI FROM WHENCE 'ZANI THE SPANIARDS 'JUAN AS 'BOBO
JUAN A FOOLISH JOHN THE FRENCH 'JEAN WITH VARIOUS ADDITIONS
AND IN ENGLISH WHEN WE CALL A MAN 'A JOHN WE DO NOT MEAN IT
AS A TITLE OF HONOUR THE TITLE OF SIR WAS USUALLY GIVEN BY
COURTESY TO PRIESTS

A YARD SHE HAD ENCLOSED ALL ABOUT

HIS VOICE WAS MERRIER THAN THE MERRY ORGON ORGAN 3
ON MASSE DAYS THAT IN THE CHURCHES GON

THAN IS A CLOCK OR AN ABBAY HORLOGE CLOCK 4
BY NATURE HE KNEW EACH ASCENSION
OF TH' EQUINOCTIAL IN THILKE TOWN
FOR WHEN DEGREES FIFTENE WERE ASCENDED
THEN CREW HE THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE AMENDED
HIS COMB WAS REDDER THAN THE FINE CORAL
EMBATTELL'D 5 AS IT WERE A CASTLE WALL
HIS BILL WAS BLACK AND AS THE JET IT SHONE
LIKE AZURE WERE HIS LEGGES AND HIS TONE TOES
HIS NAILES WHITER THAN THE LILY FLOW'R
AND LIKE THE BURNISH'D GOLD WAS HIS COLOUR
THIS GENTLE COCK HAD IN HIS GOVERNANCE
SEV'N HENNES FOR TO DO ALL HIS PLEASANCE
WHICH WERE HIS SISTERS AND HIS PARAMOURS
AND WONDROUS LIKE TO HIM AS OF COLOURS
OF WHICH THE FAIREST HUED IN THE THROAT
WAS CALLED DAMOSELLE PARTELOTE

AS WELL OF JOY AS TRIBULATIONS
THAT FOLK ENDUREN IN THIS LIFE PRESENT
THERE NEEDETH MAKE OF THIS NO ARGUMENT
THE VERY PREVE SHEWETH IT INDEED
TRIAL EXPERIENCE
ONE OF THE GREATEST AUTHORS THAT MEN READ 13
SAITH THUS THAT WHILOM TWO FELLOWES WENT
ON PILGRIMAGE IN A FULL GOOD INTENT
AND HAPPEN'D SO THEY CAME INTO A TOWN
WHERE THERE WAS SUCH A CONGREGATIOUN
OF PEOPLE AND EKE SO STRAIT OF HERBERGAGE WITHOUT LODGING
THAT THEY FOUND NOT AS MUCH AS ONE COTTAGE
IN WHICH THEY BOTHE MIGHT Y LODGED BE
WHEREFORE THEY MUSTEN OF NECESSITY
AS FOR THAT NIGHT DEPARTE COMPANY
AND EACH OF THEM WENT TO HIS HOSTELRY INN
AND TOOK HIS LODGING AS IT WOULDE FALL
THE ONE OF THEM WAS LODGED IN A STALL
FAR IN A YARD WITH OXEN OF THE PLOUGH
THAT OTHER MAN WAS LODGED WELL ENOW
AS WAS HIS AVENTURE OR HIS FORTUNE
THAT US GOVERNETH ALL AS IN COMMUNE
AND SO BEFELL THAT LONG ERE IT WERE DAY
THIS MAN METTE IN HIS BED THERE AS HE LAY DREAMED
HOW THAT HIS FELLOW GAN UPON HIM CALL
AND SAID 'ALAS FOR IN AN OX'S STALL
THIS NIGHT SHALL I BE MURDER'D WHERE I LIE
NOW HELP ME DEARE BROTHER OR I DIE
IN ALLE HASTE COME TO ME HE SAID
THIS MAN OUT OF HIS SLEEP FOR FEAR ABRAID STARTED
BUT WHEN THAT HE WAS WAK'D OUT OF HIS SLEEP
HE TURNED HIM AND TOOK OF THIS NO KEEP PAID THIS NO ATTENTION
HE THOUGHT HIS DREAM WAS BUT A VANITY
THUS TWIES IN HIS SLEEPING DREAMED HE TWICE
AND AT THE THIRDE TIME YET HIS FELLAW AGAIN
CAME AS HE THOUGHT AND SAID 'I AM NOW SLAW SLAIN
BEHOLD MY BLOODY WOUNDES DEEP AND WIDE
ARISE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING TIDE
AND AT THE WEST GATE OF THE TOWN QUOTH HE
'A CARTE FULL OF DUNG THERE SHALT THOU SEE
IN WHICH MY BODY IS HID PRIVILY
DO THILKE CART ARROSTE BOLDELY
STOP
MY GOLD CAUSED MY MURDER SOOTH TO SAYN
AND TOLD HIM EVERY POINT HOW HE WAS SLAIN
WITH A FULL PITEOUS FACE AND PALE OF HUE
AND TRUSTE WELL HIS DREAM HE FOUND FULL TRUE
FOR ON THE MORROW AS SOON AS IT WAS DAY
TO HIS FELLOWES INN HE TOOK HIS WAY
AND WHEN THAT HE CAME TO THIS OX'S STALL
AFTER HIS FELLOW HE BEGAN TO CALL
THE HOSTELERE ANSWERED HIM ANON
AND SAIDE 'SIR YOUR FELLOW IS Y GONE
AS SOON AS DAY HE WENT OUT OF THE TOWN
THIS MAN GAN FALLEN IN SUSPICIOUN
REMEMB'RING ON HIS DREAMES THAT HE METTE DREAMED
AND FORTH HE WENT NO LONGER WOULD HE LET DELAY
UNTO THE WEST GATE OF THE TOWN AND FAND FOUND
A DUNG CART AS IT WENT FOR TO DUNG LAND
THAT WAS ARRAYED IN THE SAME WISE
AS YE HAVE HEARD THE DEADE MAN DEVISE DESCRIBE
AND WITH AN HARDY HEART HE GAN TO CRY
'VENGEANCE AND JUSTICE OF THIS FELONY
MY FELLOW MURDER'D IN THIS SAME NIGHT
AND IN THIS CART HE LIES GAPING UPRIGHT

RIGHT IN THE NEXTE CHAPTER AFTER THIS
I GABBE NOT SO HAVE I JOY AND BLISS TALK IDLY
TWO MEN THAT WOULD HAVE PASSED OVER SEA
FOR CERTAIN CAUSE INTO A FAR COUNTRY
IF THAT THE WIND NOT HADDE BEEN CONTRARY
THAT MADE THEM IN A CITY FOR TO TARRY
THAT STOOD FULL MERRY UPON AN HAVEN SIDE
BUT ON A DAY AGAINST THE EVEN TIDE
THE WIND GAN CHANGE AND BLEW RIGHT AS THEM LEST AS THEY WISHED
JOLLY AND GLAD THEY WENTE TO THEIR REST
AND CASTE THEM FULL EARLY FOR TO SAIL
RESOLVED
BUT TO THE ONE MAN FELL A GREAT MARVAIL
THAT ONE OF THEM IN SLEEPING AS HE LAY
HE METTE A WONDROUS DREAM AGAINST THE DAY DREAMED
HE THOUGHT A MAN STOOD BY HIS BEDDE'S SIDE
AND HIM COMMANDED THAT HE SHOULD ABIDE
AND SAID HIM THUS 'IF THOU TO MORROW WEND
THOU SHALT BE DROWN'D MY TALE IS AT AN END
HE WOKE AND TOLD HIS FOLLOW WHAT HE METTE
AND PRAYED HIM HIS VOYAGE FOR TO LET DELAY
AS FOR THAT DAY HE PRAY'D HIM TO ABIDE
HIS FELLOW THAT LAY BY HIS BEDDE'S SIDE
GAN FOR TO LAUGH AND SCORNED HIM FULL FAST
'NO DREAM QUOTH HE 'MAY SO MY HEART AGHAST FRIGHTEN
THAT I WILL LETTE FOR TO DO MY THINGS DELAY
I SETTE NOT A STRAW BY THY DREAMINGS
FOR SWEVENS BE BUT VANITIES AND JAPES DREAMS JOKES DECEITS
MEN DREAM ALL DAY OF OWLES AND OF APES
AND EKE OF MANY A MAZE THEREWITHAL WILD IMAGINING
MEN DREAM OF THING THAT NEVER WAS NOR SHALL
BUT SINCE I SEE THAT THOU WILT HERE ABIDE
AND THUS FORSLOTHE WILFULLY THY TIDE IDLE AWAY TIME
GOD WOT IT RUETH ME AND HAVE GOOD DAY I AM SORRY FOR IT
AND THUS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT HIS WAY
BUT ERE THAT HE HAD HALF HIS COURSE SAIL'D
I KNOW NOT WHY NOR WHAT MISCHANCE IT AIL'D
BUT CASUALLY THE SHIP'S BOTTOM RENT BY ACCIDENT
AND SHIP AND MAN UNDER THE WATER WENT
IN SIGHT OF OTHER SHIPPES THERE BESIDE
THAT WITH HIM SAILED AT THE SAME TIDE
AND THEREFORE FAIRE PARTELOTE SO DEAR
BY SUCH EXAMPLES OLDE MAY'ST THOU LEAR LEARN
THAT NO MAN SHOULDE BE TOO RECKELESS
OF DREAMES FOR I SAY THEE DOUBTELESS
THAT MANY A DREAM FULL SORE IS FOR TO DREAD
LO IN THE LIFE OF SAINT KENELM 15 I READ
THAT WAS KENULPHUS' SON THE NOBLE KING
OF MERCENRIKE 16 HOW KENELM METTE A THING
A LITTLE ERE HE WAS MURDER'D ON A DAY
HIS MURDER IN HIS VISION HE SAY SAW
HIS NORICE HIM EXPOUNDED EVERY DEAL NURSE PART
HIS SWEVEN AND BADE HIM TO KEEP HIM WELL GUARD
FOR TREASON BUT HE WAS BUT SEVEN YEARS OLD
AND THEREFORE LITTLE TALE HATH HE TOLD HE ATTACHED LITTLE
OF ANY DREAM SO HOLY WAS HIS HEART
SIGNIFICANCE TO
BY GOD I HADDE LEVER THAN MY SHIRT
THAT YE HAD READ HIS LEGEND AS HAVE I
DAME PARTELOTE I SAY YOU TRUELY
MACROBIUS THAT WROTE THE VISION
IN AFRIC' OF THE WORTHY SCIPION 17
AFFIRMETH DREAMES AND SAITH THAT THEY BE
'WARNINGS OF THINGES THAT MEN AFTER SEE
AND FURTHERMORE I PRAY YOU LOOKE WELL
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT OF DANIEL
IF HE HELD DREAMES ANY VANITY
READ EKE OF JOSEPH AND THERE SHALL YE SEE
WHETHER DREAMS BE SOMETIMES I SAY NOT ALL
WARNINGS OF THINGES THAT SHALL AFTER FALL
LOOK OF EGYPT THE KING DAN PHARAOH
HIS BAKER AND HIS BUTELER ALSO
WHETHER THEY FELTE NONE EFFECT IN DREAMS
SIGNIFICANCE
WHOSO WILL SEEK THE ACTS OF SUNDRY REMES REALMS
MAY READ OF DREAMES MANY A WONDROUS THING
LO CROESUS WHICH THAT WAS OF LYDIA KING
METTE HE NOT THAT HE SAT UPON A TREE
WHICH SIGNIFIED HE SHOULDE HANGED BE 18
LO HERE ANDROMACHE HECTORE'S WIFE 19
THAT DAY THAT HECTOR SHOULDE LOSE HIS LIFE
SHE DREAMED ON THE SAME NIGHT BEFORN
HOW THAT THE LIFE OF HECTOR SHOULD BE LORN LOST
IF THILKE DAY HE WENT INTO BATTAILE
SHE WARNED HIM BUT IT MIGHT NOT AVAIL
HE WENTE FORTH TO FIGHTE NATHELESS
AND WAS Y SLAIN ANON OF ACHILLES
BUT THILKE TALE IS ALL TOO LONG TO TELL
AND EKE IT IS NIGH DAY I MAY NOT DWELL
SHORTLY I SAY AS FOR CONCLUSION
THAT I SHALL HAVE OF THIS AVISION
ADVERSITY AND I SAY FURTHERMORE
THAT I NE TELL OF LAXATIVES NO STORE HOLD LAXATIVES
FOR THEY BE VENOMOUS I WOT IT WELL OF NO VALUE
I THEM DEFY I LOVE THEM NEVER A DEL DISTRUST WHIT
BUT LET US SPEAK OF MIRTH AND STINT ALL THIS CEASE
MADAME PARTELOTE SO HAVE I BLISS
OF ONE THING GOD HATH SENT ME LARGE GRACE LIBERAL
FOR WHEN I SEE THE BEAUTY OF YOUR FACE
YE BE SO SCARLET HUED ABOUT YOUR EYEN
I MAKETH ALL MY DREADE FOR TO DIEN
FOR ALL SO SICKER AS IN PRINCIPIO 20 CERTAIN
MULIER EST HOMINIS CONFUSIO 21
MADAM THE SENTENCE OF OF THIS LATIN IS MEANING
WOMAN IS MANNE'S JOY AND MANNE'S BLISS
FOR WHEN I FEEL AT NIGHT YOUR SOFTE SIDE
ALBEIT THAT I MAY NOT ON YOU RIDE
FOR THAT OUR PERCH IS MADE SO NARROW ALAS
I AM SO FULL OF JOY AND OF SOLAS DELIGHT
THAT I DEFY BOTH SWEVEN AND EKE DREAM
AND WITH THAT WORD HE FLEW DOWN FROM THE BEAM
FOR IT WAS DAY AND EKE HIS HENNES ALL
AND WITH A CHUCK HE GAN THEM FOR TO CALL
FOR HE HAD FOUND A CORN LAY IN THE YARD
ROYAL HE WAS HE WAS NO MORE AFEAR'D
HE FEATHER'D PARTELOTE TWENTY TIME
AND AS OFT TRODE HER ERE THAT IT WAS PRIME
HE LOOKED AS IT WERE A GRIM LION
AND ON HIS TOES HE ROAMED UP AND DOWN
HE DEIGNED NOT TO SET HIS FEET TO GROUND
HE CHUCKED WHEN HE HAD A CORN Y FOUND
AND TO HIM RANNE THEN HIS WIVES ALL
THUS ROYAL AS A PRINCE IS IN HIS HALL
LEAVE I THIS CHANTICLEER IN HIS PASTURE
AND AFTER WILL I TELL HIS AVENTURE
WHEN THAT THE MONTH IN WHICH THE WORLD BEGAN
THAT HIGHTE MARCH WHEN GOD FIRST MAKED MAN
WAS COMPLETE AND Y PASSED WERE ALSO
SINCE MARCH ENDED THIRTY DAYS AND TWO
BEFELL THAT CHANTICLEER IN ALL HIS PRIDE
HIS SEVEN WIVES WALKING HIM BESIDE
CAST UP HIS EYEN TO THE BRIGHTE SUN
THAT IN THE SIGN OF TAURUS HAD Y RUN
TWENTY DEGREES AND ONE AND SOMEWHAT MORE
HE KNEW BY KIND AND BY NONE OTHER LORE NATURE LEARNING
THAT IT WAS PRIME AND CREW WITH BLISSFUL STEVEN VOICE
THE SUN HE SAID IS CLOMBEN UP IN HEAVEN
TWENTY DEGREES AND ONE AND MORE Y WIS ASSUREDLY
MADAME PARTELOTE MY WORLDE'S BLISS
HEARKEN THESE BLISSFUL BIRDES HOW THEY SING
AND SEE THE FRESHE FLOWERS HOW THEY SPRING
FULL IS MINE HEART OF REVEL AND SOLACE
BUT SUDDENLY HIM FELL A SORROWFUL CASE CASUALTY
FOR EVER THE LATTER END OF JOY IS WOE
GOD WOT THAT WORLDLY JOY IS SOON Y GO
AND IF A RHETOR COULDE FAIR INDITE ORATOR
HE IN A CHRONICLE MIGHT IT SAFELY WRITE
AS FOR A SOV'REIGN NOTABILITY A THING SUPREMELY NOTABLE
NOW EVERY WISE MAN LET HIM HEARKEN ME
THIS STORY IS ALL AS TRUE I UNDERTAKE
AS IS THE BOOK OF LAUNCELOT DU LAKE
THAT WOMEN HOLD IN FULL GREAT REVERENCE
NOW WILL I TURN AGAIN TO MY SENTENCE
A COL FOX 22 FULL OF SLY INIQUITY
THAT IN THE GROVE HAD WONNED YEARES THREE DWELT
BY HIGH IMAGINATION FORECAST
THE SAME NIGHT THOROUGH THE HEDGES BRAST BURST
INTO THE YARD WHERE CHANTICLEER THE FAIR
WAS WONT AND EKE HIS WIVES TO REPAIR
AND IN A BED OF WORTES STILL HE LAY CABBAGES
TILL IT WAS PASSED UNDERN 23 OF THE DAY
WAITING HIS TIME ON CHANTICLEER TO FALL
AS GLADLY DO THESE HOMICIDES ALL
THAT IN AWAITE LIE TO MURDER MEN
O FALSE MURD'RER ROUKING IN THY DEN CROUCHING LURKING
O NEW ISCARIOT NEW GANILION 24
O FALSE DISSIMULER O GREEK SINON 25
THAT BROUGHTEST TROY ALL UTTERLY TO SORROW
O CHANTICLEER ACCURSED BE THE MORROW
THAT THOU INTO THY YARD FLEW FROM THE BEAMS RAFTERS
THOU WERT FULL WELL Y WARNED BY THY DREAMS
THAT THILKE DAY WAS PERILOUS TO THEE
BUT WHAT THAT GOD FOREWOT MUST NEEDES BE FOREKNOWS
AFTER TH' OPINION OF CERTAIN CLERKES
WITNESS ON HIM THAT ANY PERFECT CLERK IS
THAT IN SCHOOL IS GREAT ALTERCATION
IN THIS MATTER AND GREAT DISPUTATION
AND HATH BEEN OF AN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN
BUT I NE CANNOT BOULT IT TO THE BREN EXAMINE IT THOROUGHLY 26
AS CAN THE HOLY DOCTOR AUGUSTINE
OR BOECE OR THE BISHOP BRADWARDINE 27
WHETHER THAT GODDE'S WORTHY FOREWEETING FOREKNOWLEDGE
STRAINETH ME NEEDLY FOR TO DO A THING FORCES ME
NEEDLY CALL I SIMPLE NECESSITY
OR ELLES IF FREE CHOICE BE GRANTED ME
TO DO THAT SAME THING OR DO IT NOT
THOUGH GOD FOREWOT IT ERE THAT IT WAS WROUGHT KNEW IN ADVANCE
OR IF HIS WEETING STRAINETH NEVER A DEAL HIS KNOWING CONSTRAINS
BUT BY NECESSITY CONDITIONEL
NOT AT ALL
I WILL NOT HAVE TO DO OF SUCH MATTERE
MY TALE IS OF A COCK AS YE MAY HEAR
THAT TOOK HIS COUNSEL OF HIS WIFE WITH SORROW
TO WALKEN IN THE YARD UPON THE MORROW
THAT HE HAD METTE THE DREAM AS I YOU TOLD
WOMANE'S COUNSELS BE FULL OFTEN COLD MISCHIEVOUS UNWISE
WOMANE'S COUNSEL BROUGHT US FIRST TO WOE
AND MADE ADAM FROM PARADISE TO GO
THERE AS HE WAS FULL MERRY AND WELL AT CASE
BUT FOR I N'OT TO WHOM I MIGHT DISPLEASE KNOW NOT
IF I COUNSEL OF WOMEN WOULDE BLAME
PASS OVER FOR I SAID IT IN MY GAME JEST
READ AUTHORS WHERE THEY TREAT OF SUCH MATTERE
AND WHAT THEY SAY OF WOMEN YE MAY HEAR
THESE BE THE COCKE'S WORDES AND NOT MINE
I CAN NO HARM OF NO WOMAN DIVINE CONJECTURE IMAGINE
FAIR IN THE SAND TO BATHE HER MERRILY BASK
LIES PARTELOTE AND ALL HER SISTERS BY
AGAINST THE SUN AND CHANTICLEER SO FREE
SANG MERRIER THAN THE MERMAID IN THE SEA
FOR PHYSIOLOGUS SAITH SICKERLY CERTAINLY
HOW THAT THEY SINGE WELL AND MERRILY
28
AND SO BEFELL THAT AS HE CAST HIS EYE
AMONG THE WORTES ON A BUTTERFLY CABBAGES
HE WAS WARE OF THIS FOX THAT LAY FULL LOW
NOTHING NE LIST HIM THENNE FOR TO CROW HE HAD NO INCLINATION
BUT CRIED ANON COCK COCK AND UP HE START
AS MAN THAT WAS AFFRAYED IN HIS HEART
FOR NATURALLY A BEAST DESIRETH FLEE
FROM HIS CONTRARY IF BE MAY IT SEE ENEMY
THOUGH HE NE'ER ERST HAD SOON IT WITH HIS EYE NEVER BEFORE
THIS CHANTICLEER WHEN HE GAN HIM ESPY
HE WOULD HAVE FLED BUT THAT THE FOX ANON
SAID GENTLE SIR ALAS WHY WILL YE GON
BE YE AFRAID OF ME THAT AM YOUR FRIEND
NOW CERTES I WERE WORSE THAN ANY FIEND
IF I TO YOU WOULD HARM OR VILLAINY
I AM NOT COME YOUR COUNSEL TO ESPY
BUT TRUELY THE CAUSE OF MY COMING
WAS ONLY FOR TO HEARKEN HOW YE SING
FOR TRUELY YE HAVE AS MERRY A STEVEN VOICE
AS ANY ANGEL HATH THAT IS IN HEAVEN

MY LORD YOUR FATHER GOD HIS SOULE BLESS
AND EKE YOUR MOTHER OF HER GENTLENESS

HE MUSTE WINK SO LOUD HE WOULDE CRYEN
AND STANDEN ON HIS TIPTOES THEREWITHAL
AND STRETCHE FORTH HIS NECKE LONG AND SMALL
AND EKE HE WAS OF SUCH DISCRETION
THAT THERE WAS NO MAN IN NO REGION
THAT HIM IN SONG OR WISDOM MIGHTE PASS
I HAVE WELL READ IN DAN BURNEL THE ASS 29
AMONG HIS VERSE HOW THAT THERE WAS A COCK
THAT FOR A PRIESTE'S SON GAVE HIM A KNOCK BECAUSE
UPON HIS LEG WHILE HE WAS YOUNG AND NICE FOOLISH
HE MADE HIM FOR TO LOSE HIS BENEFICE
BUT CERTAIN THERE IS NO COMPARISON
BETWIXT THE WISDOM AND DISCRETION
OF YOURE FATHER AND HIS SUBTILTY
NOW SINGE SIR FOR SAINTE CHARITY
LET SEE CAN YE YOUR FATHER COUNTERFEIT
THIS CHANTICLEER HIS WINGS BEGAN TO BEAT
AS MAN THAT COULD NOT HIS TREASON ESPY
SO WAS HE RAVISH'D WITH HIS FLATTERY
ALAS YE LORDES MANY A FALSE FLATTOUR FLATTERER 30
IS IN YOUR COURT AND MANY A LOSENGEOUR DECEIVER 31
THAT PLEASE YOU WELL MORE BY MY FAITH
THAN HE THAT SOOTHFASTNESS UNTO YOU SAITH

BEWARE YE LORDES OF THEIR TREACHERY
THIS CHANTICLEER STOOD HIGH UPON HIS TOES
STRETCHING HIS NECK AND HELD HIS EYEN CLOSE

AND DAN RUSSEL 32 THE FOX START UP AT ONCE
AND BY THE GORGE HENTE CHANTICLEER SEIZED BY THE THROAT
AND ON HIS BACK TOWARD THE WOOD HIM BARE
FOR YET WAS THERE NO MAN THAT HIM PURSU'D
O DESTINY THAT MAY'ST NOT BE ESCHEW'D ESCAPED
ALAS THAT CHANTICLEER FLEW FROM THE BEAMS
ALAS HIS WIFE RAUGHTE NOUGHT OF DREAMS REGARDED
AND ON A FRIDAY FELL ALL THIS MISCHANCE
O VENUS THAT ART GODDESS OF PLEASANCE
SINCE THAT THY SERVANT WAS THIS CHANTICLEER
AND IN THY SERVICE DID ALL HIS POWERE
MORE FOR DELIGHT THAN THE WORLD TO MULTIPLY
WHY WILT THOU SUFFER HIM ON THY DAY TO DIE
O GAUFRID DEARE MASTER SOVEREIGN 33
THAT WHEN THY WORTHY KING RICHARD WAS SLAIN
WITH SHOT COMPLAINEDEST HIS DEATH SO SORE
WHY N'HAD I NOW THY SENTENCE AND THY LORE

FOR ON A FRIDAY SOOTHLY SLAIN WAS HE
THEN WOULD I SHEW YOU HOW THAT I COULD PLAIN LAMENT
FOR CHANTICLEERE'S DREAD AND FOR HIS PAIN
CERTES SUCH CRY NOR LAMENTATION
WAS NE'ER OF LADIES MADE WHEN ILION

WHEN HE HAD HENT KING PRIAM BY THE BEARD SEIZED
AND SLAIN HIM AS SAITH US ENEIDOS 34 THE AENEID
AS MADEN ALL THE HENNES IN THE CLOSE YARD
WHEN THEY HAD SEEN OF CHANTICLEER THE SIGHT
BUT SOV'REIGNLY DAME PARTELOTE SHRIGHT ABOVE ALL OTHERS
FULL LOUDER THAN DID HASDRUBALE'S WIFE SHRIEKED
WHEN THAT HER HUSBAND HADDE LOST HIS LIFE
AND THAT THE ROMANS HAD Y BURNT CARTHAGE
SHE WAS SO FULL OF TORMENT AND OF RAGE
THAT WILFULLY INTO THE FIRE SHE START
AND BURNT HERSELFE WITH A STEADFAST HEART
O WOEFUL HENNES RIGHT SO CRIED YE
AS WHEN THAT NERO BURNED THE CITY
OF ROME CRIED THE SENATORES' WIVES
FOR THAT THEIR HUSBANDS LOSTEN ALL THEIR LIVES
WITHOUTE GUILT THIS NERO HATH THEM SLAIN
NOW WILL I TURN UNTO MY TALE AGAIN
THE SELY WIDOW AND HER DAUGHTERS TWO SIMPLE HONEST

AND AT THE DOORS OUT STARTED THEY ANON
AND SAW THE FOX TOWARD THE WOOD IS GONE

AND MALKIN WITH HER DISTAFF IN HER HAND
RAN COW AND CALF AND EKE THE VERY HOGGES
SO FEAR'D THEY WERE FOR BARKING OF THE DOGGES
AND SHOUTING OF THE MEN AND WOMEN EKE
THEY RANNE SO THEM THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WOULD BREAK
THEY YELLED AS THE FIENDES DO IN HELL
THE DUCKES CRIED AS MEN WOULD THEM QUELL KILL DESTROY
THE GEESE FOR FEARE FLEWEN O'ER THE TREES
OUT OF THE HIVE CAME THE SWARM OF BEES
SO HIDEOUS WAS THE NOISE BEN'DICITE
CERTES HE JACKE STRAW 35 AND HIS MEINIE FOLLOWERS
NE MADE NEVER SHOUTES HALF SO SHRILL
WHEN THAT THEY WOULDEN ANY FLEMING KILL
AS THILKE DAY WAS MADE UPON THE FOX
OF BRASS THEY BROUGHTE BEAMES AND OF BOX TRUMPETS 36
OF HORN AND BONE IN WHICH THEY BLEW AND POOPED TOOTED
AND THEREWITHAL THEY SHRIEKED AND THEY HOOPED
IT SEEMED AS THE HEAVEN SHOULDE FALL
NOW GOODE MEN I PRAY YOU HEARKEN ALL
LO HOW FORTUNE TURNETH SUDDENLY
THE HOPE AND PRIDE EKE OF HER ENEMY
THIS COCK THAT LAY UPON THE FOX'S BACK
IN ALL HIS DREAD UNTO THE FOX HE SPAKE
AND SAIDE SIR IF THAT I WERE AS YE
YET WOULD I SAY AS WISLY GOD HELP ME SURELY
'TURN YE AGAIN YE PROUDE CHURLES ALL
A VERY PESTILENCE UPON YOU FALL
NOW AM I COME UNTO THE WOODE'S SIDE
MAUGRE YOUR HEAD THE COCK SHALL HERE ABIDE
I WILL HIM EAT IN FAITH AND THAT ANON
THE FOX ANSWER'D IN FAITH IT SHALL BE DONE
AND AS HE SPAKE THE WORD ALL SUDDENLY
THE COCK BRAKE FROM HIS MOUTH DELIVERLY NIMBLY
AND HIGH UPON A TREE HE FLEW ANON
AND WHEN THE FOX SAW THAT THE COCK WAS GONE
ALAS QUOTH HE O CHANTICLEER ALAS
I HAVE QUOTH HE Y DONE TO YOU TRESPASS OFFENCE
INASMUCH AS I MAKED YOU AFEAR'D
WHEN I YOU HENT AND BROUGHT OUT OF YOUR YARD TOOK
BUT SIR I DID IT IN NO WICK' INTENT

FOR HE THAT WINKETH WHEN HE SHOULDE SEE
ALL WILFULLY GOD LET HIM NEVER THE THRIVE
NAY QUOTH THE FOX BUT GOD GIVE HIM MISCHANCE
THAT IS SO INDISCREET OF GOVERNANCE
THAT JANGLETH WHEN THAT HE SHOULD HOLD HIS PEACE CHATTERS
LO WHAT IT IS FOR TO BE RECKELESS
AND NEGLIGENT AND TRUST ON FLATTERY
BUT YE THAT HOLDE THIS TALE A FOLLY
AS OF A FOX OR OF A COCK OR HEN

SUCCEEDING TALE BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS TO DETERMINE WHICH THAT
TALE SHOULD BE
IN EARLIER EDITIONS THE LINES FORMED THE OPENING
OF THE PROLOGUE TO THE MANCIPLE'S TALE BUT MOST OF THE
MANUSCRIPTS ACKNOWLEDGE THEMSELVES DEFECTIVE IN THIS PART AND
GIVE THE NUN'S TALE AFTER THAT OF THE NUN'S PRIEST
IN THE HARLEIAN
MANUSCRIPT FOLLOWED BY MR WRIGHT THE SECOND NUN'S TALE AND
THE CANON'S YEOMAN'S TALE ARE PLACED AFTER THE FRANKLIN'S TALE
AND THE SIXTEEN LINES ABOVE ARE NOT FOUND THE MANCIPLE'S
PROLOGUE COMING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AMEN OF THE NUN'S
PRIEST
IN TWO MANUSCRIPTS THE LAST LINE OF THE SIXTEEN RUNS THUS
SAID UNTO THE NUN AS YE SHALL HEAR AND SIX LINES MORE
EVIDENTLY FORGED ARE GIVEN TO INTRODUCE THE NUN'S TALE
ALL THIS
CONFUSION AND DOUBT ONLY STRENGTHEN THE CERTAINTY AND DEEPEN
THE REGRET THAT THE CANTERBURY TALES WERE LEFT AT CHAUCER'S
DEATH NOT MERELY VERY IMPERFECT AS A WHOLE BUT DESTITUTE OF
MANY FINISHING TOUCHES THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THEM COMPLETE SO
FAR AS THE CONCEPTION HAD ACTUALLY BEEN CARRIED INTO
PERFORMANCE
THE SECOND NUN'S TALE 1
THE MINISTER AND NORICE UNTO VICES NURSE
WHICH THAT MEN CALL IN ENGLISH IDLENESS
THE PORTER AT THE GATE IS OF DELICES DELIGHTS
T'ESCHEW AND BY HER CONTRAR' HER OPPRESS
THAT IS TO SAY BY LAWFUL BUSINESS OCCUPATION ACTIVITY
WELL OUGHTE WE TO DO OUR ALL INTENT APPLY OURSELVES
LEST THAT THE FIEND THROUGH IDLENESS US HENT SEIZE
FOR HE THAT WITH HIS THOUSAND CORDES SLY
CONTINUALLY US WAITETH TO BECLAP ENTANGLE BIND
WHEN HE MAY MAN IN IDLENESS ESPY
HE CAN SO LIGHTLY CATCH HIM IN HIS TRAP
TILL THAT A MAN BE HENT RIGHT BY THE LAPPE SEIZE HEM
HE IS NOT WARE THE FIEND HATH HIM IN HAND
WELL OUGHT WE WORK AND IDLENESS WITHSTAND
AND THOUGH MEN DREADED NEVER FOR TO DIE
YET SEE MEN WELL BY REASON DOUBTELESS
THAT IDLENESS IS ROOT OF SLUGGARDY
OF WHICH THERE COMETH NEVER GOOD INCREASE
AND SEE THAT SLOTH THEM HOLDETH IN A LEAS LEASH 2
ONLY TO SLEEP AND FOR TO EAT AND DRINK
AND TO DEVOUREN ALL THAT OTHERS SWINK LABOUR
AND FOR TO PUT US FROM SUCH IDLENESS
THAT CAUSE IS OF SO GREAT CONFUSION

EXPOUND AS MEN MAY IN HER STORY SEE
IT IS TO SAY IN ENGLISH HEAVEN'S LILY 7
FOR PURE CHASTENESS OF VIRGINITY
OR FOR SHE WHITENESS HAD OF HONESTY PURITY
AND GREEN OF CONSCIENCE AND OF GOOD FAME
THE SWEETE SAVOUR LILIE WAS HER NAME
OR CECILIE IS TO SAY THE WAY OF BLIND 7
FOR SHE EXAMPLE WAS BY GOOD TEACHING
OR ELSE CECILIE AS I WRITTEN FIND
IS JOINED BY A MANNER CONJOINING
OF HEAVEN AND LIA 7 AND HEREIN FIGURING
THE HEAVEN IS SET FOR THOUGHT OF HOLINESS
AND LIA FOR HER LASTING BUSINESS
CECILIE MAY EKE BE SAID IN THIS MANNERE
WANTING OF BLINDNESS FOR HER GREATE LIGHT
OF SAPIENCE AND FOR HER THEWES CLEAR
QUALITIES
OR ELLES LO THIS MAIDEN'S NAME BRIGHT

MEN MIGHT HER WELL THE HEAVEN OF PEOPLE CALL
EXAMPLE OF GOOD AND WISE WORKES ALL

AND BURNING EVER IN CHARITY FULL BRIGHT
NOW HAVE I YOU DECLARED WHAT SHE HIGHT WHY SHE HAD HER NAME
THIS MAIDEN BRIGHT CECILE AS HER LIFE SAITH
WAS COME OF ROMANS AND OF NOBLE KIND
AND FROM HER CRADLE FOSTER'D IN THE FAITH
OF CHRIST AND BARE HIS GOSPEL IN HER MIND

OF HER PRAYERE AND GOD TO LOVE AND DREAD
BESEECHING HIM TO KEEP HER MAIDENHEAD
AND WHEN THIS MAIDEN SHOULD UNTO A MAN
Y WEDDED BE THAT WAS FULL YOUNG OF AGE
WHICH THAT Y CALLED WAS VALERIAN
AND COME WAS THE DAY OF MARRIAGE
SHE FULL DEVOUT AND HUMBLE IN HER CORAGE HEART
UNDER HER ROBE OF GOLD THAT SAT FULL FAIR
HAD NEXT HER FLESH Y CLAD HER IN AN HAIR GARMENT OF HAIR CLOTH
AND WHILE THE ORGANS MADE MELODY
TO GOD ALONE THUS IN HER HEART SANG SHE

AND FOR HIS LOVE THAT DIED UPON THE TREE
EVERY SECOND OR THIRD DAY SHE FAST'

THE MAID HATH BROUGHT THESE MEN TO BLISS ABOVE
THE WORLD HATH WIST WHAT IT IS WORTH CERTAIN
DEVOTION OF CHASTITY TO LOVE 10
THEN SHOWED HIM CECILIE ALL OPEN AND PLAIN
THAT IDOLS ALL ARE BUT A THING IN VAIN
FOR THEY BE DUMB AND THERETO THEY BE DEAVE THEREFORE DEAF
AND CHARGED HIM HIS IDOLS FOR TO LEAVE
WHOSO THAT TROWETH NOT THIS A BEAST HE IS BELIEVETH

MEN SHOULD HIM BRENNEN IN A FIRE SO RED BURN
IF HE WERE FOUND OR IF MEN MIGHT HIM SPY

ALGATE BURNT IN THIS WORLD SHOULD WE BE NEVERTHELESS
TO WHOM CECILIE ANSWER'D BOLDELY

IF THIS WERE LIVING ONLY AND NONE OTHER
BUT THERE IS BETTER LIFE IN OTHER PLACE
THAT NEVER SHALL BE LOSTE DREAD THEE NOUGHT
WHICH GODDE'S SON US TOLDE THROUGH HIS GRACE
THAT FATHER'S SON WHICH ALLE THINGES WROUGHT
AND ALL THAT WROUGHT IS WITH A SKILFUL THOUGHT REASONABLE
THE GHOST THAT FROM THE FATHER GAN PROCEED HOLY SPIRIT
HATH SOULED THEM WITHOUTEN ANY DREDE ENDOWED THEM WITH A SOUL
DOUBT
BY WORD AND BY MIRACLE HIGH GOD'S SON
WHEN HE WAS IN THIS WORLD DECLARED HERE
THAT THERE IS OTHER LIFE WHERE MEN MAY WON DWELL
TO WHOM ANSWER'D TIBURCE O SISTER DEAR
SAIDEST THOU NOT RIGHT NOW IN THIS MANNERE
THERE WAS BUT ONE GOD LORD IN SOOTHFASTNESS TRUTH
AND NOW OF THREE HOW MAY'ST THOU BEAR WITNESS
THAT SHALL I TELL QUOTH SHE ERE THAT I GO
RIGHT AS A MAN HATH SAPIENCES THREE MENTAL FACULTIES
MEMORY ENGINE AND INTELLECT ALSO WIT 11
SO IN ONE BEING OF DIVINITY
THREE PERSONES THERE MAYE RIGHT WELL BE
THEN GAN SHE HIM FULL BUSILY TO PREACH
OF CHRISTE'S COMING AND HIS PAINES TEACH
AND MANY POINTES OF HIS PASSION
HOW GODDE'S SON IN THIS WORLD WAS WITHHOLD EMPLOYED
TO DO MANKINDE PLEIN REMISSION FULL
THAT WAS Y BOUND IN SIN AND CARES COLD WRETCHED 12
ALL THIS THING SHE UNTO TIBURCE TOLD
AND AFTER THAT TIBURCE IN GOOD INTENT
WITH VALERIAN TO POPE URBAN HE WENT
THAT THANKED GOD AND WITH GLAD HEART AND LIGHT
HE CHRISTEN'D HIM AND MADE HIM IN THAT PLACE
PERFECT IN HIS LEARNING AND GODDE'S KNIGHT
AND AFTER THIS TIBURCE GOT SUCH GRACE
THAT EVERY DAY HE SAW IN TIME AND SPACE
TH' ANGEL OF GOD AND EVERY MANNER BOON REQUEST FAVOUR
THAT BE GOD ASKED IT WAS SPED FULL ANON
GRANTED SUCCESSFUL
IT WERE FULL HARD BY ORDER FOR TO SAYN
HOW MANY WONDERS JESUS FOR THEM WROUGHT
BUT AT THE LAST TO TELLE SHORT AND PLAIN
THE SERGEANTS OF THE TOWN OF ROME THEM SOUGHT
AND THEM BEFORE ALMACH THE PREFECT BROUGHT
WHICH THEM APPOSED AND KNEW ALL THEIR INTENT QUESTIONED
AND TO TH'IMAGE OF JUPITER THEM SENT
AND SAID WHOSO WILL NOT DO SACRIFICE
SWAP OFF HIS HEAD THIS IS MY SENTENCE HERE STRIKE
ANON THESE MARTYRS THAT I YOU DEVISE OF WHOM I TELL YOU
ONE MAXIMUS THAT WAS AN OFFICERE
OF THE PREFECT'S AND HIS CORNICULERE 13
THEM HENT AND WHEN HE FORTH THE SAINTES LAD SEIZED LED
HIMSELF HE WEPT FOR PITY THAT HE HAD
WHEN MAXIMUS HAD HEARD THE SAINTES LORE DOCTRINE TEACHING
HE GOT HIM OF THE TORMENTORES LEAVE TORTURERS
AND LED THEM TO HIS HOUSE WITHOUTE MORE
AND WITH THEIR PREACHING ERE THAT IT WERE EVE
THEY GONNEN FROM THE TORMENTORS TO REAVE BEGAN WREST ROOT OUT
AND FROM MAXIM' AND FROM HIS FOLK EACH ONE
THE FALSE FAITH TO TROW IN GOD ALONE
BELIEVE
CECILIA CAME WHEN IT WAS WAXEN NIGHT
WITH PRIESTES THAT THEM CHRISTEN'D ALL IN FERE IN A COMPANY
AND AFTERWARD WHEN DAY WAS WAXEN LIGHT
CECILE THEM SAID WITH A FULL STEADFAST CHEER MIEN
NOW CHRISTE'S OWEN KNIGHTES LEFE AND DEAR BELOVED
CAST ALL AWAY THE WORKES OF DARKNESS
AND ARME YOU IN ARMOUR OF BRIGHTNESS
YE HAVE FORSOOTH Y DONE A GREAT BATTAILE
YOUR COURSE IS DONE YOUR FAITH HAVE YE CONSERVED 14
O TO THE CROWN OF LIFE THAT MAY NOT FAIL
THE RIGHTFUL JUDGE WHICH THAT YE HAVE SERVED
SHALL GIVE IT YOU AS YE HAVE IT DESERVED
AND WHEN THIS THING WAS SAID AS I DEVISE RELATE
MEN LED THEM FORTH TO DO THE SACRIFICE
BUT WHEN THEY WERE UNTO THE PLACE BROUGHT
TO TELLE SHORTLY THE CONCLUSION
THEY WOULD INCENSE NOR SACRIFICE RIGHT NOUGHT
BUT ON THEIR KNEES THEY SETTE THEM ADOWN
WITH HUMBLE HEART AND SAD DEVOTION STEADFAST
AND LOSTE BOTH THEIR HEADES IN THE PLACE
THEIR SOULES WENTE TO THE KING OF GRACE
THIS MAXIMUS THAT SAW THIS THING BETIDE
WITH PITEOUS TEARES TOLD IT ANON RIGHT
THAT HE THEIR SOULES SAW TO HEAVEN GLIDE
WITH ANGELS FULL OF CLEARNESS AND OF LIGHT
ANDT WITH HIS WORD CONVERTED MANY A WIGHT
FOR WHICH ALMACHIUS DID HIM TO BEAT SEE NOTE 15
WITH WHIP OF LEAD TILL HE HIS LIFE GAN LETE QUIT
CECILE HIM TOOK AND BURIED HIM ANON
BY TIBURCE AND VALERIAN SOFTELY
WITHIN THEIR BURYING PLACE UNDER THE STONE
AND AFTER THIS ALMACHIUS HASTILY
BADE HIS MINISTERS FETCHEN OPENLY
CECILE SO THAT SHE MIGHT IN HIS PRESENCE
DO SACRIFICE AND JUPITER INCENSE BURN INCENSE TO
BUT THEY CONVERTED AT HER WISE LORE TEACHING
WEPTE FULL SORE AND GAVE FULL CREDENCE
UNTO HER WORD AND CRIED MORE AND MORE
CHRIST GODDE'S SON WITHOUTE DIFFERENCE
IS VERY GOD THIS IS ALL OUR SENTENCE OPINION
THAT HATH SO GOOD A SERVANT HIM TO SERVE
THUS WITH ONE VOICE WE TROWE THOUGH WE STERVE BELIEVE DIE
ALMACHIUS THAT HEARD OF THIS DOING
BADE FETCH CECILIE THAT HE MIGHT HER SEE

OF THY RELIGION AND OF THY BELIEVE
YE HAVE BEGUN YOUR QUESTION FOOLISHLY
QUOTH SHE THAT WOULDEST TWO ANSWERS CONCLUDE
IN ONE DEMAND YE ASKE LEWEDLY IGNORANTLY
ALMACH ANSWER'D TO THAT SIMILITUDE
OF WHENCE COMES THINE ANSWERING SO RUDE
OF WHENCE QUOTH SHE WHEN THAT SHE WAS FREINED ASKED
OF CONSCIENCE AND OF GOOD FAITH UNFEIGNED
ALMACHIUS SAIDE TAKEST THOU NO HEED
OF MY POWER AND SHE HIM ANSWER'D THIS
YOUR MIGHT QUOTH SHE FULL LITTLE IS TO DREAD
FOR EVERY MORTAL MANNE'S POWER IS
BUT LIKE A BLADDER FULL OF WIND Y WIS CERTAINLY

FULL WRONGFULLY BEGUNNEST THOU QUOTH HE

THAT EVERY CHRISTIAN WIGHT SHALL HAVE PENANCE PUNISHMENT
BUT IF THAT HE HIS CHRISTENDOM WITHSAY DENY
AND GO ALL QUIT IF HE WILL IT RENAY RENOUNCE
YOUR PRINCES ERREN AS YOUR NOBLEY DOTH NOBILITY

FOR YE THAT KNOWE WELL OUR INNOCENCE
FORASMUCH AS WE DO AYE REVERENCE
TO CHRIST AND FOR WE BEAR A CHRISTIAN NAME
YE PUT ON US A CRIME AND EKE A BLAME
BUT WE THAT KNOWE THILKE NAME SO
FOR VIRTUOUS WE MAY IT NOT WITHSAY
ALMACH ANSWERED CHOOSE ONE OF THESE TWO
DO SACRIFICE OR CHRISTENDOM RENAY
THAT THOU MAY'ST NOW ESCAPE BY THAT WAY
AT WHICH THE HOLY BLISSFUL FAIRE MAID
GAN FOR TO LAUGH AND TO THE JUDGE SAID
O JUDGE CONFUSED IN THY NICETY CONFOUNDED IN THY FOLLY
WOULDEST THOU THAT I RENY INNOCENCE
TO MAKE ME A WICKED WIGHT QUOTH SHE
LO HE DISSIMULETH HERE IN AUDIENCE DISSEMBLES
HE STARETH AND WOODETH IN HIS ADVERTENCE GROWS FURIOUS THOUGHT
TO WHOM ALMACHIUS SAID UNSELY WRETCH UNHAPPY
KNOWEST THOU NOT HOW FAR MY MIGHT MAY STRETCH
HAVE NOT OUR MIGHTY PRINCES TO ME GIVEN
YEA BOTHE POWER AND EKE AUTHORITY

WHY SPEAKEST THOU SO PROUDLY THEN TO ME
I SPEAKE NOT BUT STEADFASTLY QUOTH SHE
NOT PROUDLY FOR I SAY AS FOR MY SIDE

MORTALLY
AND IF THOU DREADE NOT A SOOTH TO HEAR TRUTH

FOR COMMONLY MEN WOT IT WELL OVER ALL KNOW IT EVERYWHERE
THAT MIGHTY GOD IS IN HIS HEAVEN HIGH
AND THESE IMAGES WELL MAY'ST THOU ESPY

FOR IN EFFECT THEY BE NOT WORTH A MITE
THESE WORDES AND SUCH OTHERS SAIDE SHE
AND HE WAX'D WROTH AND BADE MEN SHOULD HER LEAD

NOTES TO THE NUN'S PRIEST'S TALE
1
THIS TALE WAS ORIGINALLY COMPOSED BY CHAUCER AS A SEPARATE
WORK AND AS SUCH IT IS MENTIONED IN THE LEGEND OF GOOD
WOMEN UNDER THE TITLE OF THE LIFE OF SAINT CECILE
TYRWHITT
QUOTES THE LINE IN WHICH THE AUTHOR CALLS HIMSELF AN UNWORTHY
SON OF EVE AND THAT IN WHICH HE SAYS YET PRAY I YOU THAT
READE WHAT I WRITE AS INTERNAL EVIDENCE THAT THE INSERTION OF THE
POEM IN THE CANTERBURY TALES WAS THE RESULT OF AN AFTERTHOUGHT
WHILE THE WHOLE TENOR OF THE INTRODUCTION CONFIRMS THE BELIEF
THAT CHAUCER COMPOSED IT AS A WRITER OR TRANSLATOR NOT
DRAMATICALLY AS A SPEAKER
THE STORY IS ALMOST LITERALLY
TRANSLATED FROM THE LIFE OF ST CECILIA IN THE LEGENDA AUREA
2
LEAS LEASH SNARE THE SAME AS LAS OFTENER USED BY
CHAUCER
3
THE NATIVITY AND ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN MARY FORMED THE
THEMES OF SOME OF ST BERNARD'S MOST ELOQUENT SERMONS
4
COMPARE WITH THIS STANZA THE FOURTH STANZA OF THE PRIORESS'S
TALE THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THE SAME
5
BUT HE ANSWERED AND SAID IT IS NOT MEET TO TAKE THE
CHILDREN'S BREAD AND CAST IT TO DOGS
AND SHE SAID TRUTH LORD
YET THE DOGS EAT OF THE CRUMBS WHICH FALL FROM THEIR MASTER'S

THE PROLOGUE
WHEN ENDED WAS THE LIFE OF SAINT CECILE
ERE WE HAD RIDDEN FULLY FIVE MILE 2
AT BOUGHTON UNDER BLEE US GAN O'ERTAKE
A MAN THAT CLOTHED WAS IN CLOTHES BLACK
AND UNDERNEATH HE WORE A WHITE SURPLICE
HIS HACKENAY WHICH WAS ALL POMELY GRIS NAG DAPPLE GRAY
SO SWEATED THAT IT WONDER WAS TO SEE
IT SEEM'D AS HE HAD PRICKED MILES THREE
SPURRED
THE HORSE EKE THAT HIS YEOMAN RODE UPON
SO SWEATED THAT UNNETHES MIGHT HE GON HARDLY GO
ABOUT THE PEYTREL 3 STOOD THE FOAM FULL HIGH
HE WAS OF FOAM AS FLECKED AS A PIE SPOTTED LIKE A MAGPIE
A MAILE TWYFOLD 4 ON HIS CRUPPER LAY
IT SEEMED THAT HE CARRIED LITTLE ARRAY
ALL LIGHT FOR SUMMER RODE THIS WORTHY MAN
AND IN MY HEART TO WONDER I BEGAN
WHAT THAT HE WAS TILL THAT I UNDERSTOOD
HOW THAT HIS CLOAK WAS SEWED TO HIS HOOD
FOR WHICH WHEN I HAD LONG ADVISED ME CONSIDERED
I DEEMED HIM SOME CANON FOR TO BE
HIS HAT HUNG AT HIS BACK DOWN BY A LACE CORD
FOR HE HAD RIDDEN MORE THAN TROT OR PACE
HE HADDE PRICKED LIKE AS HE WERE WOOD MAD
A CLOTE LEAF HE HAD LAID UNDER HIS HOOD BURDOCK LEAF
FOR SWEAT AND FOR TO KEEP HIS HEAD FROM HEAT
BUT IT WAS JOYE FOR TO SEE HIM SWEAT
HIS FOREHEAD DROPPED AS A STILLATORY STILL
WERE FULL OF PLANTAIN OR OF PARITORY WALLFLOWER
AND WHEN THAT HE WAS COME HE GAN TO CRY
GOD SAVE QUOTH HE THIS JOLLY COMPANY
FAST HAVE I PRICKED QUOTH HE FOR YOUR SAKE
BECAUSE THAT I WOULD YOU OVERTAKE
TO RIDEN IN THIS MERRY COMPANY
HIS YEOMAN WAS EKE FULL OF COURTESY
AND SAIDE SIRS NOW IN THE MORNING TIDE
OUT OF YOUR HOSTELRY I SAW YOU RIDE

FOR MUCHE GOOD I DARE LAY IN BALANCE

BUT ALL HIS CRAFT YE MAY NOT WEET OF ME LEARN
AND SOMEWHAT HELP I YET TO HIS WORKING
THAT ALL THE GROUND ON WHICH WE BE RIDING
TILL THAT WE COME TO CANTERBURY TOWN
HE COULD ALL CLEANE TURNEN UP SO DOWN
AND PAVE IT ALL OF SILVER AND OF GOLD
AND WHEN THIS YEOMAN HAD THIS TALE TOLD
UNTO OUR HOST HE SAID BEN'DICITE
THIS THING IS WONDER MARVELLOUS TO ME
SINCE THAT THY LORD IS OF SO HIGH PRUDENCE
BECAUSE OF WHICH MEN SHOULD HIM REVERENCE
THAT OF HIS WORSHIP RECKETH HE SO LITE HONOUR LITTLE
HIS OVEREST SLOP IT IS NOT WORTH A MITE UPPER GARMENT
AS IN EFFECT TO HIM SO MAY I GO

SLOVENLY
WHY IS THY LORD SO SLUTTISH I THEE PRAY

AND BORROW GOLD BE IT A POUND OR TWO
OR TEN OR TWELVE OR MANY SUMMES MO'
AND MAKE THEM WEENEN AT THE LEASTE WAY FANCY
THAT OF A POUNDE WE CAN MAKE TWAY
YET IS IT FALSE AND AYE WE HAVE GOOD HOPE
IT FOR TO DO AND AFTER IT WE GROPE SEARCH STRIVE
BUT THAT SCIENCE IS SO FAR US BEFORN
THAT WE MAY NOT ALTHOUGH WE HAD IT SWORN

IT WILL US MAKE BEGGARS AT THE LAST
WHILE THIS YEOMAN WAS THUS IN HIS TALKING
THIS CANON DREW HIM NEAR AND HEARD ALL THING

NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE CANON'S YEOMAN'S TALE

THE INTRODUCTION SAYS TYRWHITT OF THE CANON'S
YEOMAN TO TELL A TALE AT A TIME WHEN SO MANY OF THE ORIGINAL
CHARACTERS REMAIN TO BE CALLED UPON APPEARS A LITTLE
EXTRAORDINARY
IT SHOULD SEEM THAT SOME SUDDEN RESENTMENT
HAD DETERMINED CHAUCER TO INTERRUPT THE REGULAR COURSE OF HIS
WORK IN ORDER TO INSERT A SATIRE AGAINST THE ALCHEMISTS
THAT
THEIR PRETENDED SCIENCE WAS MUCH CULTIVATED ABOUT THIS TIME
AND PRODUCED ITS USUAL EVILS MAY FAIRLY BE INFERRED FROM THE
ACT WHICH WAS PASSED SOON AFTER 5 H
IV
C
IV TO MAKE IT
FELONY 'TO MULTIPLY GOLD OR SILVER OR TO USE THE ART OF
MULTIPLICATION TYRWHITT FINDS IN THE PROLOGUE SOME COLOUR
FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THIS TALE WAS INTENDED BY CHAUCER TO
BEGIN THE RETURN JOURNEY FROM CANTERBURY BUT AGAINST THIS
MUST BE SET THE FACT THAT THE YEOMAN HIMSELF EXPRESSLY SPEAKS
OF THE DISTANCE TO CANTERBURY YET TO BE RIDDEN

FOR ALL OUR CRAFT WHEN WE HAVE ALL Y DO
AND ALL OUR SLEIGHT HE WILL NOT COME US TO
HE HATH Y MADE US SPENDE MUCHE GOOD
FOR SORROW OF WHICH ALMOST WE WAXED WOOD MAD
BUT THAT GOOD HOPE CREEPED IN OUR HEART
SUPPOSING EVER THOUGH WE SORE SMART
TO BE RELIEVED BY HIM AFTERWARD
SUCH SUPPOSING AND HOPE IS SHARP AND HARD
I WARN YOU WELL IT IS TO SEEKEN EVER
THAT FUTURE TEMPS HATH MADE MEN DISSEVER TIME PART FROM
IN TRUST THEREOF FROM ALL THAT EVER THEY HAD
YET OF THAT ART THEY CANNOT WAXE SAD REPENTANT
FOR UNTO THEM IT IS A BITTER SWEET
SO SEEMETH IT FOR HAD THEY BUT A SHEET
WHICH THAT THEY MIGHTE WRAP THEM IN AT NIGHT
AND A BRATT TO WALK IN BY DAYELIGHT CLOAK 10
THEY WOULD THEM SELL AND SPEND IT ON THIS CRAFT
THEY CANNOT STINT UNTIL NO THING BE LAFT
CEASE
AND EVERMORE WHEREVER THAT THEY GON
MEN MAY THEM KNOWE BY SMELL OF BRIMSTONE
FOR ALL THE WORLD THEY STINKEN AS A GOAT
THEIR SAVOUR IS SO RAMMISH AND SO HOT
THAT THOUGH A MAN A MILE FROM THEM BE
THE SAVOUR WILL INFECT HIM TRUSTE ME
LO THUS BY SMELLING AND THREADBARE ARRAY
IF THAT MEN LIST THIS FOLK THEY KNOWE MAY
AND IF A MAN WILL ASK THEM PRIVILY
WHY THEY BE CLOTHED SO UNTHRIFTILY SHABBILY
THEY RIGHT ANON WILL ROWNEN IN HIS EAR WHISPER
AND SAYEN IF THAT THEY ESPIED WERE
MEN WOULD THEM SLAY BECAUSE OF THEIR SCIENCE
LO THUS THESE FOLK BETRAYEN INNOCENCE
PASS OVER THIS I GO MY TALE UNTO
ERE THAT THE POT BE ON THE FIRE Y DO PLACED
OF METALS WITH A CERTAIN QUANTITY
MY LORD THEM TEMPERS AND NO MAN BUT HE ADJUSTS THE PROPORTIONS
NOW HE IS GONE I DARE SAY BOLDELY
FOR AS MEN SAY HE CAN DO CRAFTILY
ALGATE I WOT WELL HE HATH SUCH A NAME ALTHOUGH
AND YET FULL OFT HE RUNNETH INTO BLAME
AND KNOW YE HOW FULL OFT IT HAPP'NETH SO
THE POT TO BREAKS AND FAREWELL ALL IS GO' GONE
THESE METALS BE OF SO GREAT VIOLENCE
OUR WALLES MAY NOT MAKE THEM RESISTENCE
BUT IF THEY WERE WROUGHT OF LIME AND STONE UNLESS
THEY PIERCE SO THAT THROUGH THE WALL THEY GON
AND SOME OF THEM SINK DOWN INTO THE GROUND
THUS HAVE WE LOST BY TIMES MANY A POUND
AND SOME ARE SCATTER'D ALL THE FLOOR ABOUT
SOME LEAP INTO THE ROOF WITHOUTE DOUBT
THOUGH THAT THE FIEND NOT IN OUR SIGHT HIM SHOW
I TROWE THAT HE BE WITH US THAT SHREW IMPIOUS WRETCH
IN HELLE WHERE THAT HE IS LORD AND SIRE
IS THERE NO MORE WOE RANCOUR NOR IRE
WHEN THAT OUR POT IS BROKE AS I HAVE SAID
EVERY MAN CHIDES AND HOLDS HIM EVIL APAID DISSATISFIED
SOME SAID IT WAS LONG ON THE FIRE MAKING BECAUSE OF 11
SOME SAIDE NAY IT WAS ON THE BLOWING
THEN WAS I FEAR'D FOR THAT WAS MINE OFFICE
STRAW QUOTH THE THIRD YE BE LEWED AND NICE IGNORANT FOOLISH
IT WAS NOT TEMPER'D AS IT OUGHT TO BE MIXED IN DUE PROPORTIONS
NAY QUOTH THE FOURTHE STINT AND HEARKEN ME STOP
BECAUSE OUR FIRE WAS NOT Y MADE OF BEECH
THAT IS THE CAUSE AND OTHER NONE SO THE'CH SO MAY I THRIVE
I CANNOT TELL WHEREON IT WAS ALONG
BUT WELL I WOT GREAT STRIFE IS US AMONG
WHAT QUOTH MY LORD THERE IS NO MORE TO DO'N
OF THESE PERILS I WILL BEWARE EFTSOON ANOTHER TIME
I AM RIGHT SICKER THAT THE POT WAS CRAZED SURE CRACKED
BE AS BE MAY BE YE NO THING AMAZED CONFOUNDED
AS USAGE IS LET SWEEP THE FLOOR AS SWITHE QUICKLY
PLUCK UP YOUR HEARTES AND BE GLAD AND BLITHE
THE MULLOK ON A HEAP Y SWEEPED WAS RUBBISH
AND ON THE FLOOR Y CAST A CANEVAS
AND ALL THIS MULLOK IN A SIEVE Y THROW
AND SIFTED AND Y PICKED MANY A THROW TIME
PARDIE QUOTH ONE SOMEWHAT OF OUR METAL
YET IS THERE HERE THOUGH THAT WE HAVE NOT ALL
AND THOUGH THIS THING MISHAPPED HATH AS NOW HAS GONE AMISS
ANOTHER TIME IT MAY BE WELL ENOW
AT PRESENT
WE MUSTE PUT OUR GOOD IN ADVENTURE RISK OUR PROPERTY
A MERCHANT PARDIE MAY NOT AYE ENDURE
TRUSTE ME WELL IN HIS PROSPERITY
SOMETIMES HIS GOOD IS DRENCHED IN THE SEA DROWNED SUNK
AND SOMETIMES COMES IT SAFE UNTO THE LAND
PEACE QUOTH MY LORD THE NEXT TIME I WILL FAND ENDEAVOUR
TO BRING OUR CRAFT ALL IN ANOTHER PLIGHT TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION
AND BUT I DO SIRS LET ME HAVE THE WITE BLAME
THERE WAS DEFAULT IN SOMEWHAT WELL I WOT
ANOTHER SAID THE FIRE WAS OVER HOT
BUT BE IT HOT OR COLD I DARE SAY THIS
THAT WE CONCLUDEN EVERMORE AMISS
WE FAIL ALWAY OF THAT WHICH WE WOULD HAVE
AND IN OUR MADNESS EVERMORE WE RAVE
AND WHEN WE BE TOGETHER EVERY ONE
EVERY MAN SEEMETH A SOLOMON
BUT ALL THING WHICH THAT SHINETH AS THE GOLD
IT IS NOT GOLD AS I HAVE HEARD IT TOLD
NOR EVERY APPLE THAT IS FAIR AT EYE
IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT SO MEN CLAP OR CRY
ASSERT
RIGHT SO LO FARETH IT AMONGES US
HE THAT THE WISEST SEEMETH BY JESUS
IS MOST FOOL WHEN IT COMETH TO THE PREFE PROOF TEST
AND HE THAT SEEMETH TRUEST IS A THIEF
THAT SHALL YE KNOW ERE THAT I FROM YOU WEND
BY THAT I OF MY TALE HAVE MADE AN END
THERE WAS A CANON OF RELIGIOUN
AMONGES US WOULD INFECT ALL A TOWN DECEIVE
THOUGH IT AS GREAT WERE AS WAS NINEVEH
ROME ALISANDRE TROY OR OTHER THREE
ALEXANDRIA
HIS SLEIGHTES AND HIS INFINITE FALSENESS CUNNING TRICKS
THERE COULDE NO MAN WRITEN AS I GUESS
THOUGH THAT HE MIGHTE LIVE A THOUSAND YEAR
IN ALL THIS WORLD OF FALSENESS N'IS HIS PEER
THERE IS NOT
FOR IN HIS TERMES HE WILL HIM SO WIND
AND SPEAK HIS WORDES IN SO SLY A KIND
WHEN HE COMMUNE SHALL WITH ANY WIGHT
THAT HE WILL MAKE HIM DOAT ANON ARIGHT BECOME FOOLISHLY
BUT IT A FIENDE BE AS HIMSELF IS
FOND OF HIM
FULL MANY A MAN HATH HE BEGUIL'D ERE THIS
AND WILL IF THAT HE MAY LIVE ANY WHILE
AND YET MEN GO AND RIDE MANY A MILE
HIM FOR TO SEEK AND HAVE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
NOT KNOWING OF HIS FALSE GOVERNANCE DECEITFUL CONDUCT
AND IF YOU LIST TO GIVE ME AUDIENCE
I WILL IT TELLE HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE
BUT WORSHIPFUL CANONS RELIGIOUS
NE DEEME NOT THAT I SLANDER YOUR HOUSE
ALTHOUGH THAT MY TALE OF A CANON BE
OF EVERY ORDER SOME SHREW IS PARDIE
AND GOD FORBID THAT ALL A COMPANY
SHOULD RUE A SINGULAR MANNE'S FOLLY
INDIVIDUAL
TO SLANDER YOU IS NO THING MINE INTENT
BUT TO CORRECT THAT IS AMISS I MEANT
THIS TALE WAS NOT ONLY TOLD FOR YOU
BUT EKE FOR OTHER MORE YE WOT WELL HOW
THAT AMONGES CHRISTE'S APOSTLES TWELVE
THERE WAS NO TRAITOR BUT JUDAS HIMSELVE
THEN WHY SHOULD ALL THE REMENANT HAVE BLAME
THAT GUILTLESS WERE BY YOU I SAY THE SAME
SAVE ONLY THIS IF YE WILL HEARKEN ME
IF ANY JUDAS IN YOUR CONVENT BE
REMOVE HIM BETIMES I YOU REDE COUNSEL
IF SHAME OR LOSS MAY CAUSEN ANY DREAD
AND BE NO THING DISPLEASED I YOU PRAY
BUT IN THIS CASE HEARKEN WHAT I SAY
IN LONDON WAS A PRIEST AN ANNUALERE 12
THAT THEREIN DWELLED HADDE MANY A YEAR
WHICH WAS SO PLEASANT AND SO SERVICEABLE
UNTO THE WIFE WHERE AS HE WAS AT TABLE
THAT SHE WOULD SUFFER HIM NO THING TO PAY
FOR BOARD NOR CLOTHING WENT HE NE'ER SO GAY
AND SPENDING SILVER HAD HE RIGHT ENOW
THEREOF NO FORCE WILL PROCEED AS NOW NO MATTER
AND TELLE FORTH MY TALE OF THE CANON
THAT BROUGHT THIS PRIESTE TO CONFUSION
THIS FALSE CANON CAME UPON A DAY
UNTO THE PRIESTE'S CHAMBER WHERE HE LAY
BESEECHING HIM TO LEND HIM A CERTAIN
OF GOLD AND HE WOULD QUIT IT HIM AGAIN
LEND ME A MARK QUOTH HE BUT DAYES THREE
AND AT MY DAY I WILL IT QUITE THEE
AND IF IT SO BE THAT THOU FIND ME FALSE
ANOTHER DAY HANG ME UP BY THE HALSE NECK
THIS PRIEST HIM TOOK A MARK AND THAT AS SWITHE QUICKLY
AND THIS CANON HIM THANKED OFTEN SITHE TIMES
AND TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENTE FORTH HIS WAY
AND AT THE THIRDE DAY BROUGHT HIS MONEY
AND TO THE PRIEST HE TOOK HIS GOLD AGAIN
WHEREOF THIS PRIEST WAS WONDROUS GLAD AND FAIN PLEASED
CERTES QUOTH HE NOTHING ANNOYETH ME I AM NOT UNWILING
TO LEND A MAN A NOBLE OR TWO OR THREE
OR WHAT THING WERE IN MY POSSESSION
WHEN HE SO TRUE IS OF CONDITION
THAT IN NO WISE HE BREAKE WILL HIS DAY
TO SUCH A MAN I NEVER CAN SAY NAY
WHAT QUOTH THIS CANON SHOULD I BE UNTRUE
NAY THAT WERE THING Y FALLEN ALL OF NEW A NEW THING TO HAPPEN
TRUTH IS A THING THAT I WILL EVER KEEP
UNTO THE DAY IN WHICH THAT I SHALL CREEP
INTO MY GRAVE AND ELLES GOD FORBID
BELIEVE THIS AS SICKER AS YOUR CREED
SURE
GOD THANK I AND IN GOOD TIME BE IT SAID
THAT THERE WAS NEVER MAN YET EVIL APAID DISPLEASED DISSATISFIED
FOR GOLD NOR SILVER THAT HE TO ME LENT
NOR EVER FALSEHOOD IN MINE HEART I MEANT
AND SIR QUOTH HE NOW OF MY PRIVITY
SINCE YE SO GOODLY HAVE BEEN UNTO ME
AND KITHED TO ME SO GREAT GENTLENESS SHOWN
SOMEWHAT TO QUITE WITH YOUR KINDENESS
I WILL YOU SHEW AND IF YOU LIST TO LEAR LEARN
I WILL YOU TEACHE PLAINLY THE MANNERE
HOW I CAN WORKEN IN PHILOSOPHY
TAKE GOOD HEED YE SHALL WELL SEE AT EYE WITH YOUR OWN EYE
THAT I WILL DO A MAS'TRY ERE I GO
YEA QUOTH THE PRIEST YEA SIR AND WILL YE SO
MARY THEREOF I PRAY YOU HEARTILY
AT YOUR COMMANDEMENT SIR TRUELY

LO HOW THIS THIEFE COULD HIS SERVICE BEDE OFFER
FULL SOOTH IT IS THAT SUCH PROFFER'D SERVICE
STINKETH AS WITNESSE THESE OLDE WISE THOSE WISE FOLK OF OLD
AND THAT FULL SOON I WILL IT VERIFY
IN THIS CANON ROOT OF ALL TREACHERY
THAT EVERMORE DELIGHT HAD AND GLADNESS
SUCH FIENDLY THOUGHTES IN HIS HEART IMPRESS PRESS INTO HIS HEART
HOW CHRISTE'S PEOPLE HE MAY TO MISCHIEF BRING
GOD KEEP US FROM HIS FALSE DISSIMULING
WHAT WISTE THIS PRIEST WITH WHOM THAT HE DEALT
NOR OF HIS HARM COMING HE NOTHING FELT
O SELY PRIEST O SELY INNOCENT SIMPLE
WITH COVETISE ANON THOU SHALT BE BLENT BLINDED BEGUILED
O GRACELESS FULL BLIND IS THY CONCEIT
FOR NOTHING ART THOU WARE OF THE DECEIT
WHICH THAT THIS FOX Y SHAPEN HATH TO THEE CONTRIVED

WHEREFORE TO GO TO THE CONCLUSIOUN
THAT REFERRETH TO THY CONFUSION
UNHAPPY MAN ANON I WILL ME HIE HASTEN
TO TELLE THINE UNWIT AND THY FOLLY STUPIDITY
AND EKE THE FALSENESS OF THAT OTHER WRETCH

FOR BY MY FAITH I WOULD NOT FOR MY HOOD WORTH ANYTHING
BUT IF THEY WERE SILVER FINE AND GOOD UNLESS
AND THAT AS SWITHE WELL PROVED SHALL IT BE QUICKLY
UNTO THE GOLDSMITH WITH THESE TEINES THREE
THEY WENT ANON AND PUT THEM IN ASSAY PROOF
TO FIRE AND HAMMER MIGHT NO MAN SAY NAY
BUT THAT THEY WEREN AS THEY OUGHT TO BE
THIS SOTTED PRIEST WHO GLADDER WAS THAN HE STUPID BESOTTED
WAS NEVER BIRD GLADDER AGAINST THE DAY
NOR NIGHTINGALE IN THE SEASON OF MAY
WAS NEVER NONE THAT BETTER LIST TO SING
NOR LADY LUSTIER IN CAROLLING
OR FOR TO SPEAK OF LOVE AND WOMANHEAD
NOR KNIGHT IN ARMS TO DO A HARDY DEED
TO STANDEN IN GRACE OF HIS LADY DEAR
THAN HAD THIS PRIEST THIS CRAFTE FOR TO LEAR
AND TO THE CANON THUS HE SPAKE AND SAID
FOR LOVE OF GOD THAT FOR US ALLE DIED
AND AS I MAY DESERVE IT UNTO YOU
WHAT SHALL THIS RECEIPT COSTE TELL ME NOW
BY OUR LADY QUOTH THIS CANON IT IS DEAR
I WARN YOU WELL THAT SAVE I AND A FRERE
IN ENGLELAND THERE CAN NO MAN IT MAKE
NO FORCE QUOTH HE NOW SIR FOR GODDE'S SAKE NO MATTER

THIS PRIEST THE SUM OF FORTY POUND ANON
OF NOBLES FET AND TOOK THEM EVERY ONE FETCHED
TO THIS CANON FOR THIS ILKE RECEIPT
ALL HIS WORKING WAS BUT FRAUD AND DECEIT
SIR PRIEST HE SAID I KEEP TO HAVE NO LOS CARE PRAISE 16
OF MY CRAFT FOR I WOULD IT WERE KEPT CLOSE
AND AS YE LOVE ME KEEP IT SECRE
FOR IF MEN KNEWEN ALL MY SUBTLETY
BY GOD THEY WOULDE HAVE SO GREAT ENVY
TO ME BECAUSE OF MY PHILOSOPHY
I SHOULD BE DEAD THERE WERE NO OTHER WAY
GOD IT FORBID QUOTH THE PRIEST WHAT YE SAY
YET HAD I LEVER SPENDEN ALL THE GOOD RATHER
WHICH THAT I HAVE AND ELLES WERE I WOOD MAD
THAN THAT YE SHOULDE FALL IN SUCH MISCHIEF
FOR YOUR GOOD WILL SIR HAVE YE RIGHT GOOD PREFE RESULTS OF YOUR
QUOTH THE CANON AND FAREWELL GRAND MERCY EXPERIMENTS
HE WENT HIS WAY AND NEVER THE PRIEST HIM SEY SAW
AFTER THAT DAY AND WHEN THAT THIS PRIEST SHOULD
MAKEN ASSAY AT SUCH TIME AS HE WOULD
OF THIS RECEIPT FAREWELL IT WOULD NOT BE
LO THUS BEJAPED AND BEGUIL'D WAS HE TRICKED
THUS MADE HE HIS INTRODUCTION
TO BRINGE FOLK TO THEIR DESTRUCTION
CONSIDER SIRS HOW THAT IN EACH ESTATE
BETWIXTE MEN AND GOLD THERE IS DEBATE
SO FARFORTH THAT UNNETHES IS THERE NONE SCARCELY IS THERE ANY
THIS MULTIPLYING BLINT SO MANY A ONE BLINDS DECEIVE
THAT IN GOOD FAITH I TROWE THAT IT BE
THE CAUSE GREATEST OF SUCH SCARCITY
THESE PHILOSOPHERS SPEAK SO MISTILY
IN THIS CRAFT THAT MEN CANNOT COME THEREBY
FOR ANY WIT THAT MEN HAVE HOW A DAYS
THEY MAY WELL CHATTER AS DO THESE JAYS
AND IN THEIR TERMES SET THEIR LUST AND PAIN PLEASURE AND EXERTION
BUT TO THEIR PURPOSE SHALL THEY NE'ER ATTAIN
A MAN MAY LIGHTLY LEARN IF HE HAVE AUGHT EASILY
TO MULTIPLY AND BRING HIS GOOD TO NAUGHT
LO SUCH A LUCRE IS IN THIS LUSTY GAME PROFIT PLEASANT
A MANNE'S MIRTH IT WILL TURN ALL TO GRAME SORROW 17
AND EMPTY ALSO GREAT AND HEAVY PURSES
AND MAKE FOLKE FOR TO PURCHASE CURSES
OF THEM THAT HAVE THERETO THEIR GOOD Y LENT
OH FY FOR SHAME THEY THAT HAVE BEEN BRENT BURNT
ALAS CAN THEY NOT FLEE THE FIRE'S HEAT
YE THAT IT USE I REDE THAT YE IT LETE ADVISE LEAVE
LEST YE LOSE ALL FOR BETTER THAN NEVER IS LATE
NEVER TO THRIVE WERE TOO LONG A DATE
THOUGH YE PROWL AYE YE SHALL IT NEVER FIND
YE BE AS BOLD AS IS BAYARD THE BLIND
THAT BLUNDERS FORTH AND PERIL CASTETH NONE PERCEIVES NO DANGER
HE IS AS BOLD TO RUN AGAINST A STONE
AS FOR TO GO BESIDE IT IN THE WAY
SO FARE YE THAT MULTIPLY I SAY
IF THAT YOUR EYEN CANNOT SEE ARIGHT
LOOK THAT YOUR MINDE LACKE NOT HIS SIGHT
FOR THOUGH YOU LOOK NEVER SO BROAD AND STARE
YE SHALL NOT WIN A MITE ON THAT CHAFFARE TRAFFIC COMMERCE
BUT WASTEN ALL THAT YE MAY RAPE AND RENN GET BY HOOK OR CROOK
WITHDRAW THE FIRE LEST IT TOO FASTE BRENN BURN
MEDDLE NO MORE WITH THAT ART I MEAN
FOR IF YE DO YOUR THRIFT IS GONE FULL CLEAN
PROSPERITY
AND RIGHT AS SWITHE I WILL YOU TELLE HERE QUICKLY
WHAT PHILOSOPHERS SAY IN THIS MATTERE
LO THUS SAITH ARNOLD OF THE NEWE TOWN 18
AS HIS ROSARY MAKETH MENTIOUN
HE SAITH RIGHT THUS WITHOUTEN ANY LIE
THERE MAY NO MAN MERCURY MORTIFY 13
BUT IT BE WITH HIS BROTHER'S KNOWLEDGING EXCEPT
LO HOW THAT HE WHICH FIRSTE SAID THIS THING
OF PHILOSOPHERS FATHER WAS HERMES 19
HE SAITH HOW THAT THE DRAGON DOUBTELESS
HE DIETH NOT BUT IF THAT HE BE SLAIN
WITH HIS BROTHER
AND THIS IS FOR TO SAYN
BY THE DRAGON MERCURY AND NONE OTHER
HE UNDERSTOOD AND BRIMSTONE BY HIS BROTHER
THAT OUT OF SOL AND LUNA WERE Y DRAW DRAWN DERIVED
AND THEREFORE SAID HE TAKE HEED TO MY SAW
SAYING
LET NO MAN BUSY HIM THIS ART TO SEECH STUDY EXPLORE
BUT IF THAT HE TH'INTENTION AND SPEECH UNLESS
OF PHILOSOPHERS UNDERSTANDE CAN
AND IF HE DO HE IS A LEWED MAN
IGNORANT FOOLISH
FOR THIS SCIENCE AND THIS CONNING QUOTH HE KNOWLEDGE
IS OF THE SECRET OF SECRETS 20 PARDIE
ALSO THERE WAS A DISCIPLE OF PLATO
THAT ON A TIME SAID HIS MASTER TO
AS HIS BOOK SENIOR 21 WILL BEAR WITNESS
AND THIS WAS HIS DEMAND IN SOOTHFASTNESS
TELL ME THE NAME OF THILKE PRIVY STONE THAT SECRET
AND PLATO ANSWER'D UNTO HIM ANON
TAKE THE STONE THAT TITANOS MEN NAME
WHICH IS THAT QUOTH HE
MAGNESIA IS THE SAME
SAIDE PLATO
YEA SIR AND IS IT THUS
THIS IS IGNOTUM PER IGNOTIUS
22
WHAT IS MAGNESIA GOOD SIR I PRAY
IT IS A WATER THAT IS MADE I SAY
OF TH' ELEMENTES FOURE QUOTH PLATO
TELL ME THE ROOTE GOOD SIR QUOTH HE THO THEN
OF THAT WATER IF THAT IT BE YOUR WILL
NAY NAY QUOTH PLATO CERTAIN THAT I N'ILL WILL NOT
THE PHILOSOPHERS SWORN WERE EVERY ONE
THAT THEY SHOULD NOT DISCOVER IT TO NONE
NOR IN NO BOOK IT WRITE IN NO MANNERE
FOR UNTO GOD IT IS SO LEFE AND DEAR PRECIOUS
THAT HE WILL NOT THAT IT DISCOVER'D BE
BUT WHERE IT LIKETH TO HIS DEITY
MAN FOR TO INSPIRE AND EKE FOR TO DEFEND' PROTECT
WHOM THAT HE LIKETH LO THIS IS THE END
THEN THUS CONCLUDE I SINCE THAT GOD OF HEAVEN
WILL NOT THAT THESE PHILOSOPHERS NEVEN NAME
HOW THAT A MAN SHALL COME UNTO THIS STONE
I REDE AS FOR THE BEST TO LET IT GON
COUNSEL
FOR WHOSO MAKETH GOD HIS ADVERSARY
AS FOR TO WORK ANY THING IN CONTRARY
OF HIS WILL CERTES NEVER SHALL HE THRIVE
THOUGH THAT HE MULTIPLY TERM OF HIS LIVE

BOB UP AND DOWN MR WRIGHT SUPPOSES THIS TO BE THE VILLAGE OF
HARBLEDOWN NEAR CANTERBURY WHICH IS SITUATED ON A HILL AND NEAR
WHICH THERE ARE MANY UPS AND DOWNS IN THE ROAD
LIKE BOUGHTON
WHERE THE CANON AND HIS YEOMAN OVERTOOK THE PILGRIMS IT STOOD ON
THE SKIRTS OF THE KENTISH FOREST OF BLEAN OR BLEE
2
DUN IS IN THE MIRE A PROVERBIAL SAYING
DUN IS A NAME FOR AN
ASS DERIVED FROM HIS COLOUR
3
THE MENTION OF THE COOK HERE WITH NO HINT THAT HE HAD ALREADY
TOLD A STORY CONFIRMS THE INDICATION GIVEN BY THE IMPERFECT
CONDITION OF HIS TALE THAT CHAUCER INTENDED TO SUPPRESS THE TALE
ALTOGETHER AND MAKE HIM TELL A STORY IN SOME OTHER PLACE
4
THE QUINTAIN CALLED FAN OR VANE BECAUSE IT TURNED ROUND LIKE
A WEATHER COCK
5
REFERRING TO THE CLASSIFICATION OF WINE ACCORDING TO ITS EFFECTS ON
A MAN GIVEN IN THE OLD CALENDRIER DES BERGIERS THE MAN OF
CHOLERIC TEMPERAMENT HAS WINE OF LION THE SANGUINE WINE OF
APE THE PHLEGMATIC WINE OF SHEEP THE MELANCHOLIC WINE OF
SOW THERE IS A RABBINICAL TRADITION THAT WHEN NOAH WAS PLANTING
VINES SATAN SLAUGHTERED BESIDE THEM THE FOUR ANIMALS NAMED HENCE
THE EFFECT OF WINE IN MAKING THOSE WHO DRINK IT DISPLAY IN TURN THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL THE FOUR
6
THE POSE A DEFLUXION OR RHEUM WHICH STOPS THE NOSE AND
OBSTRUCTS THE VOICE
7
BRING THEE TO HIS LURE A PHRASE IN HAWKING TO RECALL A HAWK TO
THE FIST THE MEANING HERE IS THAT THE COOK MAY ONE DAY BRING THE
MANCIPLE TO ACCOUNT OR PAY HIM OFF FOR THE REBUKE OF HIS
DRUNKENNESS
THE TALE
1
WHEN PHOEBUS DWELLED HERE IN EARTH ADOWN
AS OLDE BOOKES MAKE MENTIOUN
HE WAS THE MOSTE LUSTY BACHELER PLEASANT
OF ALL THIS WORLD AND EKE THE BEST ARCHER
ALSO
HE SLEW PYTHON THE SERPENT AS HE LAY
SLEEPING AGAINST THE SUN UPON A DAY
AND MANY ANOTHER NOBLE WORTHY DEED
HE WITH HIS BOW WROUGHT AS MEN MAYE READ
PLAYEN HE COULD ON EVERY MINSTRELSY
AND SINGE THAT IT WAS A MELODY
TO HEAREN OF HIS CLEARE VOICE THE SOUN'
CERTES THE KING OF THEBES AMPHIOUN
THAT WITH HIS SINGING WALLED THE CITY
COULD NEVER SINGE HALF SO WELL AS HE
THERETO HE WAS THE SEEMLIESTE MAN
THAT IS OR WAS SINCE THAT THE WORLD BEGAN
WHAT NEEDETH IT HIS FEATURES TO DESCRIVE
FOR IN THIS WORLD IS NONE SO FAIR ALIVE
HE WAS THEREWITH FULL FILL'D OF GENTLENESS
OF HONOUR AND OF PERFECT WORTHINESS
THIS PHOEBUS THAT WAS FLOWER OF BACH'LERY
AS WELL IN FREEDOM AS IN CHIVALRY GENEROSITY
FOR HIS DISPORT IN SIGN EKE OF VICTORY
OF PYTHON SO AS TELLETH US THE STORY
WAS WONT TO BEAREN IN HIS HAND A BOW
NOW HAD THIS PHOEBUS IN HIS HOUSE A CROW
WHICH IN A CAGE HE FOSTER'D MANY A DAY
AND TAUGHT IT SPEAKEN AS MEN TEACH A JAY
WHITE WAS THIS CROW AS IS A SNOW WHITE SWAN
AND COUNTERFEIT THE SPEECH OF EVERY MAN
HE COULDE WHEN HE SHOULDE TELL A TALE
THEREWITH IN ALL THIS WORLD NO NIGHTINGALE
NE COULDE BY AN HUNDRED THOUSAND DEAL PART
SINGE SO WONDROUS MERRILY AND WELL
NOW HAD THIS PHOEBUS IN HIS HOUSE A WIFE
WHICH THAT HE LOVED MORE THAN HIS LIFE
AND NIGHT AND DAY DID EVER HIS DILIGENCE
HER FOR TO PLEASE AND DO HER REVERENCE
SAVE ONLY IF THAT I THE SOOTH SHALL SAYN
JEALOUS HE WAS AND WOULD HAVE KEPT HER FAIN
FOR HIM WERE LOTH Y JAPED FOR TO BE TRICKED DECEIVED
AND SO IS EVERY WIGHT IN SUCH DEGREE
BUT ALL FOR NOUGHT FOR IT AVAILETH NOUGHT
A GOOD WIFE THAT IS CLEAN OF WORK AND THOUGHT
SHOULD NOT BE KEPT IN NONE AWAIT CERTAIN OBSERVATION
AND TRUELY THE LABOUR IS IN VAIN
TO KEEP A SHREWE FOR IT WILL NOT BE
ILL DISPOSED WOMAN
THIS HOLD I FOR A VERY NICETY SHEER FOLLY
TO SPILLE LABOUR FOR TO KEEPE WIVES LOSE
THUS WRITEN OLDE CLERKES IN THEIR LIVES
BUT NOW TO PURPOSE AS I FIRST BEGAN
THIS WORTHY PHOEBUS DID ALL THAT HE CAN
TO PLEASE HER WEENING THROUGH SUCH PLEASANCE
AND FOR HIS MANHOOD AND HIS GOVERNANCE
THAT NO MAN SHOULD HAVE PUT HIM FROM HER GRACE
BUT GOD IT WOT THERE MAY NO MAN EMBRACE
AS TO DISTRAIN A THING WHICH THAT NATURE SUCCEED IN CONSTRAINING
HATH NATURALLY SET IN A CREATURE
TAKE ANY BIRD AND PUT IT IN A CAGE
AND DO ALL THINE INTENT AND THY CORAGE WHAT THY HEART PROMPTS
TO FOSTER IT TENDERLY WITH MEAT AND DRINK
OF ALLE DAINTIES THAT THOU CANST BETHINK
AND KEEP IT ALL SO CLEANLY AS THOU MAY
ALTHOUGH THE CAGE OF GOLD BE NEVER SO GAY
YET HAD THIS BIRD BY TWENTY THOUSAND FOLD
LEVER IN A FOREST BOTH WILD AND COLD RATHER
GO EATE WORMES AND SUCH WRETCHEDNESS
FOR EVER THIS BIRD WILL DO HIS BUSINESS
T'ESCAPE OUT OF HIS CAGE WHEN THAT HE MAY
HIS LIBERTY THE BIRD DESIRETH AYE
2
LET TAKE A CAT AND FOSTER HER WITH MILK
AND TENDER FLESH AND MAKE HER COUCH OF SILK
AND LET HER SEE A MOUSE GO BY THE WALL
ANON SHE WEIVETH MILK AND FLESH AND ALL FORSAKETH
AND EVERY DAINTY THAT IS IN THAT HOUSE
SUCH APPETITE HATH SHE TO EAT THE MOUSE
LO HERE HATH KIND HER DOMINATION NATURE
AND APPETITE FLEMETH DISCRETION
DRIVES OUT
A SHE WOLF HATH ALSO A VILLAIN'S KIND
THE LEWEDESTE WOLF THAT SHE MAY FIND
OR LEAST OF REPUTATION WILL SHE TAKE
IN TIME WHEN HER LUST TO HAVE A MAKE SHE DESIRES MATE
ALL THESE EXAMPLES SPEAK I BY THESE MEN WITH REFERENCE TO
THAT BE UNTRUE AND NOTHING BY WOMEN
FOR MEN HAVE EVER A LIK'ROUS APPETITE
ON LOWER THINGS TO PERFORM THEIR DELIGHT
THAN ON THEIR WIVES BE THEY NEVER SO FAIR
NEVER SO TRUE NOR SO DEBONAIR GENTLE MILD
FLESH IS SO NEWEFANGLED WITH MISCHANCE ILL LUCK TO IT
THAT WE CAN IN NO THINGE HAVE PLEASANCE
THAT SOUNETH UNTO VIRTUE ANY WHILE
ACCORDS WITH
THIS PHOEBUS WHICH THAT THOUGHT UPON NO GUILE
DECEIVED WAS FOR ALL HIS JOLLITY
FOR UNDER HIM ANOTHER HADDE SHE
A MAN OF LITTLE REPUTATION
NOUGHT WORTH TO PHOEBUS IN COMPARISON
THE MORE HARM IS IT HAPPENS OFTEN SO
OF WHICH THERE COMETH MUCHE HARM AND WOE
AND SO BEFELL WHEN PHOEBUS WAS ABSENT
HIS WIFE ANON HATH FOR HER LEMAN SENT
UNLAWFUL LOVER
HER LEMAN CERTES THAT IS A KNAVISH SPEECH
FORGIVE IT ME AND THAT I YOU BESEECH
THE WISE PLATO SAITH AS YE MAY READ
THE WORD MUST NEEDS ACCORDE WITH THE DEED
IF MEN SHALL TELLE PROPERLY A THING
THE WORD MUST COUSIN BE TO THE WORKING
I AM A BOISTOUS MAN RIGHT THUS I SAY
ROUGH SPOKEN DOWNRIGHT
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE TRUELY
BETWIXT A WIFE THAT IS OF HIGH DEGREE
IF OF HER BODY DISHONEST SHE BE
AND ANY POORE WENCH OTHER THAN THIS
IF IT SO BE THEY WORKE BOTH AMISS
BUT FOR THE GENTLE IS IN ESTATE ABOVE BECAUSE
SHE SHALL BE CALL'D HIS LADY AND HIS LOVE
AND FOR THAT OTHER IS A POOR WOMAN
SHE SHALL BE CALL'D HIS WENCH AND HIS LEMAN
AND GOD IT WOT MINE OWEN DEARE BROTHER
MEN LAY THE ONE AS LOW AS LIES THE OTHER
RIGHT SO BETWIXT A TITLELESS TYRANT USURPER
AND AN OUTLAW OR ELSE A THIEF ERRANT WANDERING
THE SAME I SAY THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE
TO ALEXANDER TOLD WAS THIS SENTENCE
BUT FOR THE TYRANT IS OF GREATER MIGHT
BY FORCE OF MEINIE FOR TO SLAY DOWNRIGHT FOLLOWERS
AND BURN BOTH HOUSE AND HOME AND MAKE ALL PLAIN LEVEL
LO THEREFORE IS HE CALL'D A CAPITAIN
AND FOR THE OUTLAW HATH BUT SMALL MEINIE
AND MAY NOT DO SO GREAT AN HARM AS HE
NOR BRING A COUNTRY TO SO GREAT MISCHIEF
MEN CALLE HIM AN OUTLAW OR A THIEF
BUT FOR I AM A MAN NOT TEXTUEL LEARNED IN TEXTS
I WILL NOT TELL OF TEXTS NEVER A DEAL WHIT
I WILL GO TO MY TALE AS I BEGAN
WHEN PHOEBUS' WIFE HAD SENT FOR HER LEMAN
ANON THEY WROUGHTEN ALL THEIR LUST VOLAGE LIGHT OR RASH PLEASURE
THIS WHITE CROW THAT HUNG AYE IN THE CAGE
BEHELD THEIR WORK AND SAID NEVER A WORD
AND WHEN THAT HOME WAS COME PHOEBUS THE LORD

NOTES TO THE PROLOGUE TO THE PARSON'S TALE
1
ROM RAM RUF A CONTEMPTUOUS REFERENCE TO THE ALLITERATIVE
POETRY WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME VERY POPULAR IN PREFERENCE EVEN
IT WOULD SEEM TO RHYME IN THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
WHERE THE LANGUAGE WAS MUCH MORE BARBAROUS AND UNPOLISHED
THAN IN THE SOUTH
2
PERFECT GLORIOUS PILGRIMAGE THE WORD IS USED HERE TO SIGNIFY
THE SHRINE OR DESTINATION TO WHICH PILGRIMAGE IS MADE
THE TALE
1
THE PARSON BEGINS HIS LITTLE TREATISE WHICH IF GIVEN AT
LENGTH WOULD EXTEND TO ABOUT THIRTY OF THESE PAGES AND WHICH
CANNOT BY ANY STRETCH OF COURTESY OR FANCY BE SAID TO MERIT THE
TITLE OF A TALE IN THESE WORDS
OUR SWEET LORD GOD OF HEAVEN THAT NO MAN WILL PERISH BUT
WILL THAT WE COME ALL TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM AND TO THE
BLISSFUL LIFE THAT IS PERDURABLE EVERLASTING ADMONISHES US BY
THE PROPHET JEREMIAH THAT SAITH IN THIS WISE STAND UPON THE
WAYS AND SEE AND ASK OF OLD PATHS THAT IS TO SAY OF OLD
SENTENCES WHICH IS THE GOOD WAY AND WALK IN THAT WAY AND YE
SHALL FIND REFRESHING FOR YOUR SOULS 2 C
MANY BE THE
SPIRITUAL WAYS THAT LEAD FOLK TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND TO THE
REIGN OF GLORY OF WHICH WAYS THERE IS A FULL NOBLE WAY AND FULL
CONVENABLE WHICH MAY NOT FAIL TO MAN NOR TO WOMAN THAT
THROUGH SIN HATH MISGONE FROM THE RIGHT WAY OF JERUSALEM
CELESTIAL AND THIS WAY IS CALLED PENITENCE
OF WHICH MEN SHOULD
GLADLY HEARKEN AND INQUIRE WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS TO WIT WHAT IS
PENITENCE AND WHENCE IT IS CALLED PENITENCE AND IN WHAT
MANNER AND IN HOW MANY MANNERS BE THE ACTIONS OR WORKINGS
OF PENITENCE AND HOW MANY SPECIES THERE BE OF PENITENCES AND
WHAT THINGS APPERTAIN AND BEHOVE TO PENITENCE AND WHAT THINGS
DISTURB PENITENCE
PENITENCE IS DESCRIBED ON THE AUTHORITY OF SAINTS AMBROSE
ISIDORE AND GREGORY AS THE BEWAILING OF SIN THAT HAS BEEN
WROUGHT WITH THE PURPOSE NEVER AGAIN TO DO THAT THING OR ANY
OTHER THING WHICH A MAN SHOULD BEWAIL FOR WEEPING AND NOT
CEASING TO DO THE SIN WILL NOT AVAIL THOUGH IT IS TO BE HOPED
THAT AFTER EVERY TIME THAT A MAN FALLS BE IT EVER SO OFTEN HE MAY
FIND GRACE TO ARISE THROUGH PENITENCE
AND REPENTANT FOLK THAT
LEAVE THEIR SIN ERE SIN LEAVE THEM ARE ACCOUNTED BY HOLY CHURCH
SURE OF THEIR SALVATION EVEN THOUGH THE REPENTANCE BE AT THE LAST
HOUR
THERE ARE THREE ACTIONS OF PENITENCE THAT A MAN BE
BAPTIZED AFTER HE HAS SINNED THAT HE DO NO DEADLY SIN AFTER
RECEIVING BAPTISM AND THAT HE FALL INTO NO VENIAL SINS FROM DAY
TO DAY
THEREOF SAITH ST AUGUSTINE THAT PENITENCE OF GOOD AND
HUMBLE FOLK IS THE PENITENCE OF EVERY DAY THE SPECIES OF
PENITENCE ARE THREE SOLEMN WHEN A MAN IS OPENLY EXPELLED
FROM HOLY CHURCH IN LENT OR IS COMPELLED BY HOLY CHURCH TO
DO OPEN PENANCE FOR AN OPEN SIN OPENLY TALKED OF IN THE
COUNTRY COMMON PENANCE ENJOINED BY PRIESTS IN CERTAIN CASES
AS TO GO ON PILGRIMAGE NAKED OR BAREFOOT AND PRIVY PENANCE
WHICH MEN DO DAILY FOR PRIVATE SINS OF WHICH THEY CONFESS
PRIVATELY AND RECEIVE PRIVATE PENANCE
TO VERY PERFECT PENITENCE
ARE BEHOVEFUL AND NECESSARY THREE THINGS CONTRITION OF HEART
CONFESSION OF MOUTH AND SATISFACTION WHICH ARE FRUITFUL
PENITENCE AGAINST DELIGHT IN THINKING RECKLESS SPEECH AND
WICKED SINFUL WORKS
PENITENCE MAY BE LIKENED TO A TREE HAVING ITS ROOT IN CONTRITION
BIDING ITSELF IN THE HEART AS A TREE ROOT DOES IN THE EARTH OUT OF
THIS ROOT SPRINGS A STALK THAT BEARS BRANCHES AND LEAVES OF
CONFESSION AND FRUIT OF SATISFACTION
OF THIS ROOT ALSO SPRINGS A
SEED OF GRACE WHICH IS MOTHER OF ALL SECURITY AND THIS SEED IS
EAGER AND HOT AND THE GRACE OF THIS SEED SPRINGS OF GOD
THROUGH REMEMBRANCE ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT AND ON THE PAINS
OF HELL
THE HEAT OF THIS SEED IS THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE DESIRE
OF EVERLASTING JOY AND THIS HEAT DRAWS THE HEART OF MAN TO GOD
AND MAKES HIM HATE HIS SIN
PENANCE IS THE TREE OF LIFE TO THEM
THAT RECEIVE IT
IN PENANCE OR CONTRITION MAN SHALL UNDERSTAND
FOUR THINGS WHAT IS CONTRITION WHAT ARE THE CAUSES THAT MOVE A
MAN TO CONTRITION HOW HE SHOULD BE CONTRITE AND WHAT
CONTRITION AVAILETH TO THE SOUL
CONTRITION IS THE HEAVY AND
GRIEVOUS SORROW THAT A MAN RECEIVETH IN HIS HEART FOR HIS SINS
WITH EARNEST PURPOSE TO CONFESS AND DO PENANCE AND NEVER
MORE TO SIN
SIX CAUSES OUGHT TO MOVE A MAN TO CONTRITION 1
HE SHOULD REMEMBER HIM OF HIS SINS 2
HE SHOULD REFLECT THAT
SIN PUTTETH A MAN IN GREAT THRALDOM AND ALL THE GREATER THE
HIGHER IS THE ESTATE FROM WHICH HE FALLS 3
HE SHOULD DREAD THE
DAY OF DOOM AND THE HORRIBLE PAINS OF HELL 4
THE SORROWFUL
REMEMBRANCE OF THE GOOD DEEDS THAT MAN HATH OMITTED TO DO
HERE ON EARTH AND ALSO THE GOOD THAT HE HATH LOST OUGHT TO
MAKE HIM HAVE CONTRITION 5
SO ALSO OUGHT THE REMEMBRANCE OF
THE PASSION THAT OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST SUFFERED FOR OUR SINS 6
AND SO OUGHT THE HOPE OF THREE THINGS THAT IS TO SAY
FORGIVENESS OF SIN THE GIFT OF GRACE TO DO WELL AND THE GLORY OF
HEAVEN WITH WHICH GOD SHALL REWARD MAN FOR HIS GOOD DEEDS
ALL THESE POINTS THE PARSON ILLUSTRATES AND ENFORCES AT LENGTH
WAXING ESPECIALLY ELOQUENT UNDER THE THIRD HEAD AND PLAINLY
SETTING FORTH THE STERNLY REALISTIC NOTIONS REGARDING FUTURE
PUNISHMENTS THAT WERE ENTERTAINED IN THE TIME OF CHAUCER 3
CERTES ALL THE SORROW THAT A MAN MIGHT MAKE FROM THE
BEGINNING OF THE WORLD IS BUT A LITTLE THING AT RETARD OF IN
COMPARISON WITH THE SORROW OF HELL
THE CAUSE WHY THAT JOB
CALLETH HELL THE LAND OF DARKNESS 4 UNDERSTAND THAT HE CALLETH
IT LAND OR EARTH FOR IT IS STABLE AND NEVER SHALL FAIL AND DARK FOR
HE THAT IS IN HELL HATH DEFAULT IS DEVOID OF LIGHT NATURAL FOR
CERTES THE DARK LIGHT THAT SHALL COME OUT OF THE FIRE THAT EVER
SHALL BURN SHALL TURN THEM ALL TO PAIN THAT BE IN HELL FOR IT
SHEWETH THEM THE HORRIBLE DEVILS THAT THEM TORMENT
COVERED
WITH THE DARKNESS OF DEATH THAT IS TO SAY THAT HE THAT IS IN HELL
SHALL HAVE DEFAULT OF THE SIGHT OF GOD FOR CERTES THE SIGHT OF
GOD IS THE LIFE PERDURABLE EVERLASTING
THE DARKNESS OF DEATH
BE THE SINS THAT THE WRETCHED MAN HATH DONE WHICH THAT DISTURB
PREVENT HIM TO SEE THE FACE OF GOD RIGHT AS A DARK CLOUD DOTH
BETWEEN US AND THE SUN
LAND OF MISEASE BECAUSE THERE BE THREE
MANNER OF DEFAULTS AGAINST THREE THINGS THAT FOLK OF THIS WORLD
HAVE IN THIS PRESENT LIFE THAT IS TO SAY HONOURS DELIGHTS AND
RICHES
AGAINST HONOUR HAVE THEY IN HELL SHAME AND CONFUSION
FOR WELL YE WOT THAT MEN CALL HONOUR THE REVERENCE THAT MAN
DOTH TO MAN BUT IN HELL IS NO HONOUR NOR REVERENCE FOR CERTES
NO MORE REVERENCE SHALL BE DONE THERE TO A KING THAN TO A KNAVE
SERVANT
FOR WHICH GOD SAITH BY THE PROPHET JEREMIAH THE
FOLK THAT ME DESPISE SHALL BE IN DESPITE HONOUR IS ALSO CALLED
GREAT LORDSHIP
THERE SHALL NO WIGHT SERVE OTHER BUT OF HARM
AND TORMENT
HONOUR IS ALSO CALLED GREAT DIGNITY AND HIGHNESS
BUT IN HELL SHALL THEY BE ALL FORTRODDEN TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT OF
DEVILS
AS GOD SAITH THE HORRIBLE DEVILS SHALL GO AND COME
UPON THE HEADS OF DAMNED FOLK AND THIS IS FORASMUCH AS THE
HIGHER THAT THEY WERE IN THIS PRESENT LIFE THE MORE SHALL THEY BE
ABATED ABASED AND DEFOULED IN HELL
AGAINST THE RICHES OF THIS
WORLD SHALL THEY HAVE MISEASE TROUBLE TORMENT OF POVERTY AND
THIS POVERTY SHALL BE IN FOUR THINGS IN DEFAULT WANT OF TREASURE
OF WHICH DAVID SAITH THE RICH FOLK THAT EMBRACED AND ONED
UNITED ALL THEIR HEART TO TREASURE OF THIS WORLD SHALL SLEEP IN THE
SLEEPING OF DEATH AND NOTHING SHALL THEY FIND IN THEIR HANDS OF
ALL THEIR TREASURE AND MOREOVER THE MISEASE OF HELL SHALL BE IN
DEFAULT OF MEAT AND DRINK
FOR GOD SAITH THUS BY MOSES THEY
SHALL BE WASTED WITH HUNGER AND THE BIRDS OF HELL SHALL DEVOUR
THEM WITH BITTER DEATH AND THE GALL OF THE DRAGON SHALL BE THEIR
DRINK AND THE VENOM OF THE DRAGON THEIR MORSELS AND
FURTHERMORE THEIR MISEASE SHALL BE IN DEFAULT OF CLOTHING FOR
THEY SHALL BE NAKED IN BODY AS OF CLOTHING SAVE THE FIRE IN
WHICH THEY BURN AND OTHER FILTHS AND NAKED SHALL THEY BE IN
SOUL OF ALL MANNER VIRTUES WHICH THAT IS THE CLOTHING OF THE SOUL
WHERE BE THEN THE GAY ROBES AND THE SOFT SHEETS AND THE FINE
SHIRTS LO WHAT SAITH OF THEM THE PROPHET ISAIAH THAT UNDER
THEM SHALL BE STREWED MOTHS AND THEIR COVERTURES SHALL BE OF
WORMS OF HELL
AND FURTHERMORE THEIR MISEASE SHALL BE IN DEFAULT
OF FRIENDS FOR HE IS NOT POOR THAT HATH GOOD FRIENDS BUT THERE IS
NO FRIEND FOR NEITHER GOD NOR ANY GOOD CREATURE SHALL BE FRIEND
TO THEM AND EVEREACH OF THEM SHALL HATE OTHER WITH DEADLY HATE
THE SONS AND THE DAUGHTERS SHALL REBEL AGAINST FATHER AND
MOTHER AND KINDRED AGAINST KINDRED AND CHIDE AND DESPISE EACH
OTHER BOTH DAY AND NIGHT AS GOD SAITH BY THE PROPHET MICAH
AND THE LOVING CHILDREN THAT WHOM LOVED SO FLESHLY EACH OTHER
WOULD EACH OF THEM EAT THE OTHER IF THEY MIGHT
FOR HOW SHOULD
THEY LOVE TOGETHER IN THE PAINS OF HELL WHEN THEY HATED EACH
OTHER IN THE PROSPERITY OF THIS LIFE FOR TRUST WELL THEIR FLESHLY
LOVE WAS DEADLY HATE AS SAITH THE PROPHET DAVID WHOSO
LOVETH WICKEDNESS HE HATETH HIS OWN SOUL AND WHOSO HATETH
HIS OWN SOUL CERTES HE MAY LOVE NONE OTHER WIGHT IN NO
MANNER AND THEREFORE IN HELL IS NO SOLACE NOR NO FRIENDSHIP BUT
EVER THE MORE KINDREDS THAT BE IN HELL THE MORE CURSING THE
MORE CHIDING AND THE MORE DEADLY HATE THERE IS AMONG THEM
AND FURTHEROVER THEY SHALL HAVE DEFAULT OF ALL MANNER DELIGHTS
FOR CERTES DELIGHTS BE AFTER THE APPETITES OF THE FIVE WITS
SENSES AS SIGHT HEARING SMELLING SAVOURING TASTING AND
TOUCHING
BUT IN HELL THEIR SIGHT SHALL BE FULL OF DARKNESS AND OF
SMOKE AND THEIR EYES FULL OF TEARS AND THEIR HEARING FULL OF
WAIMENTING LAMENTING AND GRINTING GNASHING OF TEETH AS
SAITH JESUS CHRIST THEIR NOSTRILS SHALL BE FULL OF STINKING AND AS
SAITH ISAIAH THE PROPHET THEIR SAVOURING TASTING SHALL BE FULL OF
BITTER GALL AND TOUCHING OF ALL THEIR BODY SHALL BE COVERED WITH
FIRE THAT NEVER SHALL QUENCH AND WITH WORMS THAT NEVER SHALL
DIE AS GOD SAITH BY THE MOUTH OF ISAIAH
AND FORASMUCH AS THEY
SHALL NOT WEEN THAT THEY MAY DIE FOR PAIN AND BY DEATH FLEE FROM
PAIN THAT MAY THEY UNDERSTAND IN THE WORD OF JOB THAT SAITH
THERE IS THE SHADOW OF DEATH CERTES A SHADOW HATH THE
LIKENESS OF THE THING OF WHICH IT IS SHADOWED BUT THE SHADOW IS
NOT THE SAME THING OF WHICH IT IS SHADOWED RIGHT SO FARETH THE
PAIN OF HELL IT IS LIKE DEATH FOR THE HORRIBLE ANGUISH AND WHY
FOR IT PAINETH THEM EVER AS THOUGH THEY SHOULD DIE ANON BUT
CERTES THEY SHALL NOT DIE
FOR AS SAITH SAINT GREGORY TO
WRETCHED CAITIFFS SHALL BE GIVEN DEATH WITHOUT DEATH AND END
WITHOUT END AND DEFAULT WITHOUT FAILING FOR THEIR DEATH SHALL
ALWAYS LIVE AND THEIR END SHALL EVERMORE BEGIN AND THEIR DEFAULT
SHALL NEVER FAIL AND THEREFORE SAITH SAINT JOHN THE EVANGELIST
THEY SHALL FOLLOW DEATH AND THEY SHALL NOT FIND HIM AND THEY
SHALL DESIRE TO DIE AND DEATH SHALL FLEE FROM THEM AND EKE JOB
SAITH THAT IN HELL IS NO ORDER OF RULE
AND ALBEIT THAT GOD HATH
CREATED ALL THINGS IN RIGHT ORDER AND NOTHING WITHOUT ORDER BUT
ALL THINGS BE ORDERED AND NUMBERED YET NEVERTHELESS THEY THAT
BE DAMNED BE NOT IN ORDER NOR HOLD NO ORDER
FOR THE EARTH
SHALL BEAR THEM NO FRUIT FOR AS THE PROPHET DAVID SAITH GOD
SHALL DESTROY THE FRUIT OF THE EARTH AS FOR THEM NOR WATER SHALL
GIVE THEM NO MOISTURE NOR THE AIR NO REFRESHING NOR THE FIRE NO
LIGHT
FOR AS SAITH SAINT BASIL THE BURNING OF THE FIRE OF THIS
WORLD SHALL GOD GIVE IN HELL TO THEM THAT BE DAMNED BUT THE
LIGHT AND THE CLEARNESS SHALL BE GIVEN IN HEAVEN TO HIS CHILDREN
RIGHT AS THE GOOD MAN GIVETH FLESH TO HIS CHILDREN AND BONES TO
HIS HOUNDS AND FOR THEY SHALL HAVE NO HOPE TO ESCAPE SAITH
JOB AT LAST THAT THERE SHALL HORROR AND GRISLY DREAD DWELL WITHOUT
END
HORROR IS ALWAYS DREAD OF HARM THAT IS TO COME AND THIS
DREAD SHALL EVER DWELL IN THE HEARTS OF THEM THAT BE DAMNED
AND THEREFORE HAVE THEY LOST ALL THEIR HOPE FOR SEVEN CAUSES
FIRST FOR GOD THAT IS THEIR JUDGE SHALL BE WITHOUT MERCY TO THEM
NOR THEY MAY NOT PLEASE HIM NOR NONE OF HIS HALLOWS SAINTS
NOR THEY MAY GIVE NOTHING FOR THEIR RANSOM NOR THEY HAVE NO
VOICE TO SPEAK TO HIM NOR THEY MAY NOT FLEE FROM PAIN NOR THEY
HAVE NO GOODNESS IN THEM THAT THEY MAY SHEW TO DELIVER THEM
FROM PAIN
UNDER THE FOURTH HEAD OF GOOD WORKS THE PARSON SAYS
THE COURTEOUS LORD JESUS CHRIST WILL THAT NO GOOD WORK BE LOST
FOR IN SOMEWHAT IT SHALL AVAIL
BUT FORASMUCH AS THE GOOD WORKS
THAT MEN DO WHILE THEY BE IN GOOD LIFE BE ALL AMORTISED KILLED
DEADENED BY SIN FOLLOWING AND ALSO SINCE ALL THE GOOD WORKS
THAT MEN DO WHILE THEY BE IN DEADLY SIN BE UTTERLY DEAD AS FOR TO
HAVE THE LIFE PERDURABLE EVERLASTING WELL MAY THAT MAN THAT NO
GOOD WORKS DOTH SING THAT NEW FRENCH SONG J'AI TOUT PERDU
MON TEMPS ET MON LABOUR 5
FOR CERTES SIN BEREAVETH A MAN
BOTH THE GOODNESS OF NATURE AND EKE THE GOODNESS OF GRACE
FOR SOOTHLY THE GRACE OF THE HOLY GHOST FARETH LIKE FIRE THAT
MAY NOT BE IDLE FOR FIRE FAILETH ANON AS IT FORLETETH LEAVETH ITS
WORKING AND RIGHT SO GRACE FAILETH ANON AS IT FORLETETH ITS
WORKING
THEN LOSETH THE SINFUL MAN THE GOODNESS OF GLORY THAT
ONLY IS TO GOOD MEN THAT LABOUR AND WORK
WELL MAY HE BE SORRY
THEN THAT OWETH ALL HIS LIFE TO GOD AS LONG AS HE HATH LIVED AND
ALSO AS LONG AS HE SHALL LIVE THAT NO GOODNESS HATH TO PAY WITH
HIS DEBT TO GOD TO WHOM HE OWETH ALL HIS LIFE FOR TRUST WELL HE
SHALL GIVE ACCOUNT AS SAITH SAINT BERNARD OF ALL THE GOODS THAT
HAVE BEEN GIVEN HIM IN HIS PRESENT LIFE AND HOW HE HATH THEM
DISPENDED INSOMUCH THAT THERE SHALL NOT PERISH AN HAIR OF HIS
HEAD NOR A MOMENT OF AN HOUR SHALL NOT PERISH OF HIS TIME THAT
HE SHALL NOT GIVE THEREOF A RECKONING
HAVING TREATED OF THE CAUSES THE PARSON COMES TO THE MANNER
OF CONTRITION WHICH SHOULD BE UNIVERSAL AND TOTAL NOT MERELY
OF OUTWARD DEEDS OF SIN BUT ALSO OF WICKED DELIGHTS AND
THOUGHTS AND WORDS FOR CERTES ALMIGHTY GOD IS ALL GOOD AND
THEREFORE EITHER HE FORGIVETH ALL OR ELSE RIGHT NAUGHT FURTHER
CONTRITION SHOULD BE WONDER SORROWFUL AND ANGUISHOUS AND
ALSO CONTINUAL WITH STEADFAST PURPOSE OF CONFESSION AND
AMENDMENT
LASTLY OF WHAT CONTRITION AVAILETH THE PARSON SAYS
THAT SOMETIMES IT DELIVERETH MAN FROM SIN THAT WITHOUT IT NEITHER
CONFESSION NOR SATISFACTION IS OF ANY WORTH THAT IT DESTROYETH
THE PRISON OF HELL AND MAKETH WEAK AND FEEBLE ALL THE STRENGTHS
OF THE DEVILS AND RESTORETH THE GIFTS OF THE HOLY GHOST AND OF ALL
GOOD VIRTUES AND CLEANSETH THE SOUL OF SIN AND DELIVERETH IT
FROM THE PAIN OF HELL AND FROM THE COMPANY OF THE DEVIL AND
FROM THE SERVAGE SLAVERY OF SIN AND RESTORETH IT TO ALL GOODS
SPIRITUAL AND TO THE COMPANY AND COMMUNION OF HOLY CHURCH
HE WHO SHOULD SET HIS INTENT TO THESE THINGS WOULD NO LONGER BE
INCLINED TO SIN BUT WOULD GIVE HIS HEART AND BODY TO THE SERVICE
OF JESUS CHRIST AND THEREOF DO HIM HOMAGE
FOR CERTES OUR
LORD JESUS CHRIST HATH SPARED US SO BENIGNLY IN OUR FOLLIES THAT
IF HE HAD NOT PITY ON MAN'S SOUL A SORRY SONG MIGHT WE ALL SING
THE SECOND PART OF THE PARSON'S TALE OR TREATISE OPENS WITH AN
EXPLANATION OF WHAT IS CONFESSION WHICH IS TERMED THE
SECOND PART OF PENITENCE THAT IS SIGN OF CONTRITION WHETHER IT
OUGHT NEEDS BE DONE OR NOT AND WHAT THINGS BE CONVENABLE TO
TRUE CONFESSION
CONFESSION IS TRUE SHEWING OF SINS TO THE PRIEST
WITHOUT EXCUSING HIDING OR FORWRAPPING DISGUISING OF
ANYTHING AND WITHOUT VAUNTING OF GOOD WORKS
ALSO IT IS
NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND WHENCE THAT SINS SPRING AND HOW THEY
INCREASE AND WHICH THEY BE FROM ADAM WE TOOK ORIGINAL SIN
FROM HIM FLESHLY DESCENDED BE WE ALL AND ENGENDERED OF VILE
AND CORRUPT MATTER AND THE PENALTY OF ADAM'S TRANSGRESSION
DWELLETH WITH US AS TO TEMPTATION WHICH PENALTY IS CALLED
CONCUPISCENCE
THIS CONCUPISCENCE WHEN IT IS WRONGFULLY
DISPOSED OR ORDAINED IN A MAN IT MAKETH HIM COVET BY COVETISE
OF FLESH FLESHLY SIN BY SIGHT OF HIS EYES AS TO EARTHLY THINGS AND
ALSO COVETISE OF HIGHNESS BY PRIDE OF HEART THE PARSON
PROCEEDS TO SHEW HOW MAN IS TEMPTED IN HIS FLESH TO SIN HOW
AFTER HIS NATURAL CONCUPISCENCE COMES SUGGESTION OF THE DEVIL
THAT IS TO SAY THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS WITH WHICH HE BLOWETH IN MAN
THE FIRE OF CON CUPISCENCE AND HOW MAN THEN BETHINKETH HIM
WHETHER HE WILL DO OR NO THE THING TO WHICH HE IS TEMPTED
IF HE
FLAME UP INTO PLEASURE AT THE THOUGHT AND GIVE WAY THEN IS HE
ALL DEAD IN SOUL AND THUS IS SIN ACCOMPLISHED BY TEMPTATION BY
DELIGHT AND BY CONSENTING AND THEN IS THE SIN ACTUAL SIN IS
EITHER VENIAL OR DEADLY DEADLY WHEN A MAN LOVES ANY CREATURE
MORE THAN JESUS CHRIST OUR CREATOR VENIAL IF HE LOVE JESUS
CHRIST LESS THAN HE OUGHT
VENIAL SINS DIMINISH MAN'S LOVE TO
GOD MORE AND MORE AND MAY IN THIS WISE SKIP INTO DEADLY SIN
FOR MANY SMALL MAKE A GREAT
AND HEARKEN THIS EXAMPLE A
GREAT WAVE OF THE SEA COMETH SOMETIMES WITH SO GREAT A
VIOLENCE THAT IT DRENCHETH CAUSES TO SINK THE SHIP AND THE
SAME HARM DO SOMETIMES THE SMALL DROPS OF WATER THAT ENTER
THROUGH A LITTLE CREVICE IN THE THURROK HOLD BILGE AND IN THE
BOTTOM OF THE SHIP IF MEN BE SO NEGLIGENT THAT THEY DISCHARGE
THEM NOT BETIMES
AND THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THERE BE DIFFERENCE
BETWIXT THESE TWO CAUSES OF DRENCHING ALGATES IN ANY CASE THE
SHIP IS DREINT SUNK
RIGHT SO FARETH IT SOMETIMES OF DEADLY SIN
AND OF VENIAL SINS WHEN THEY MULTIPLY IN A MAN SO GREATLY AS TO
MAKE HIM LOVE WORLDLY THINGS MORE THAN GOD
THE PARSON THEN
ENUMERATES SPECIALLY A NUMBER OF SINS WHICH MANY A MAN
PERADVENTURE DEEMS NO SINS AND CONFESSES THEM NOT AND YET
NEVERTHELESS THEY ARE TRULY SINS
THIS IS TO SAY AT EVERY TIME THAT A MAN EATETH AND DRINKETH MORE
THAN SUFFICETH TO THE SUSTENANCE OF HIS BODY IN CERTAIN HE DOTH
SIN EKE WHEN HE SPEAKETH MORE THAN IT NEEDETH HE DOTH SIN EKE
WHEN HE HEARETH NOT BENIGNLY THE COMPLAINT OF THE POOR EKE
WHEN HE IS IN HEALTH OF BODY AND WILL NOT FAST WHEN OTHER FOLK
FAST WITHOUT CAUSE REASONABLE EKE WHEN HE SLEEPETH MORE THAN
NEEDETH OR WHEN HE COMETH BY THAT OCCASION TOO LATE TO CHURCH
OR TO OTHER WORKS OF CHARITY EKE WHEN HE USETH HIS WIFE WITHOUT
SOVEREIGN DESIRE OF ENGENDRURE TO THE HONOUR OF GOD OR FOR THE
INTENT TO YIELD HIS WIFE HIS DEBT OF HIS BODY EKE WHEN HE WILL NOT
VISIT THE SICK OR THE PRISONER IF HE MAY EKE IF HE LOVE WIFE OR
CHILD OR OTHER WORLDLY THING MORE THAN REASON REQUIRETH EKE IF
HE FLATTER OR BLANDISH MORE THAN HE OUGHT FOR ANY NECESSITY EKE
IF HE MINISH OR WITHDRAW THE ALMS OF THE POOR EKE IF HE APPARAIL
PREPARE HIS MEAT MORE DELICIOUSLY THAN NEED IS OR EAT IT TOO
HASTILY BY LIKEROUSNESS GLUTTONY EKE IF HE TALK VANITIES IN THE
CHURCH OR AT GOD'S SERVICE OR THAT HE BE A TALKER OF IDLE WORDS
OF FOLLY OR VILLAINY FOR HE SHALL YIELD ACCOUNT OF THEM AT THE DAY
OF DOOM EKE WHEN HE BEHIGHTETH PROMISETH OR ASSURETH TO DO
THINGS THAT HE MAY NOT PERFORM EKE WHEN THAT BY LIGHTNESS OF
FOLLY HE MISSAYETH OR SCORNETH HIS NEIGHBOUR EKE WHEN HE HATH
ANY WICKED SUSPICION OF THING THAT HE WOT OF IT NO
SOOTHFASTNESS THESE THINGS AND MORE WITHOUT NUMBER BE SINS
AS SAITH SAINT AUGUSTINE
NO EARTHLY MAN MAY ESCHEW ALL VENIAL SINS YET MAY HE REFRAIN
HIM BY THE BURNING LOVE THAT HE HATH TO OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST
AND BY PRAYER AND CONFESSION AND OTHER GOOD WORKS SO THAT IT
SHALL BUT LITTLE GRIEVE
FURTHERMORE MEN MAY ALSO REFRAIN AND
PUT AWAY VENIAL SIN BY RECEIVING WORTHILY THE PRECIOUS BODY OF
JESUS CHRIST BY RECEIVING EKE OF HOLY WATER BY ALMS DEED BY
GENERAL CONFESSION OF CONFITEOR AT MASS AND AT PRIME AND AT
COMPLINE EVENING SERVICE AND BY BLESSING OF BISHOPS AND
PRIESTS AND BY OTHER GOOD WORKS THE PARSON THEN PROCEEDS TO
WEIGHTIER MATTERS
NOW IT IS BEHOVELY PROFITABLE NECESSARY TO TELL WHICH BE
DEADLY SINS THAT IS TO SAY CHIEFTAINS OF SINS FORASMUCH AS ALL
THEY RUN IN ONE LEASH BUT IN DIVERSE MANNERS
NOW BE THEY
CALLED CHIEFTAINS FORASMUCH AS THEY BE CHIEF AND OF THEM SPRING
ALL OTHER SINS
THE ROOT OF THESE SINS THEN IS PRIDE THE GENERAL
ROOT OF ALL HARMS
FOR OF THIS ROOT SPRING CERTAIN BRANCHES AS IRE
ENVY ACCIDIE 6 OR SLOTH AVARICE OR COVETOUSNESS TO COMMON
UNDERSTANDING GLUTTONY AND LECHERY AND EACH OF THESE SINS
HATH HIS BRANCHES AND HIS TWIGS AS SHALL BE DECLARED IN THEIR
CHAPTERS FOLLOWING
AND THOUGH SO BE THAT NO MAN CAN TELL
UTTERLY THE NUMBER OF THE TWIGS AND OF THE HARMS THAT COME OF
PRIDE YET WILL I SHEW A PART OF THEM AS YE SHALL UNDERSTAND
THERE IS INOBEDIENCE VAUNTING HYPOCRISY DESPITE ARROGANCE
IMPUDENCE SWELLING OF HEARTE INSOLENCE ELATION IMPATIENCE
STRIFE CONTUMACY PRESUMPTION IRREVERENCE PERTINACITY VAIN
GLORY AND MANY ANOTHER TWIG THAT I CANNOT TELL NOR DECLARE
AND YET MOREOVER THERE IS A PRIVY SPECIES OF PRIDE THAT WAITETH
FIRST TO BE SALUTED ERE HE WILL SALUTE ALL ALTHOUGH BE HE LESS
WORTHY THAN THAT OTHER IS AND EKE HE WAITETH EXPECTETH OR
DESIRETH TO SIT OR TO GO ABOVE HIM IN THE WAY OR KISS THE PAX
7 OR BE INCENSED OR GO TO OFFERING BEFORE HIS NEIGHBOUR AND
SUCH SEMBLABLE LIKE THINGS AGAINST HIS DUTY PERADVENTURE BUT
THAT HE HATH HIS HEART AND HIS INTENT IN SUCH A PROUD DESIRE TO BE
MAGNIFIED AND HONOURED BEFORE THE PEOPLE
NOW BE THERE TWO
MANNER OF PRIDES THE ONE OF THEM IS WITHIN THE HEART OF A MAN
AND THE OTHER IS WITHOUT
OF WHICH SOOTHLY THESE FORESAID THINGS
AND MORE THAN I HAVE SAID APPERTAIN TO PRIDE THAT IS WITHIN THE
HEART OF A MAN AND THERE BE OTHER SPECIES OF PRIDE THAT BE
WITHOUT BUT NEVERTHELESS THE ONE OF THESE SPECIES OF PRIDE IS
SIGN OF THE OTHER RIGHT AS THE GAY LEVESELL BUSH AT THE TAVERN IS
SIGN OF THE WINE THAT IS IN THE CELLAR
AND THIS IS IN MANY THINGS
AS IN SPEECH AND COUNTENANCE AND OUTRAGEOUS ARRAY OF CLOTHING
FOR CERTES IF THERE HAD BEEN NO SIN IN CLOTHING CHRIST WOULD NOT
SO SOON HAVE NOTED AND SPOKEN OF THE CLOTHING OF THAT RICH MAN
IN THE GOSPEL
AND SAINT GREGORY SAITH THAT PRECIOUS CLOTHING IS
CULPABLE FOR THE DEARTH DEARNESS OF IT AND FOR ITS SOFTNESS AND
FOR ITS STRANGENESS AND DISGUISING AND FOR THE SUPERFLUITY OR FOR
THE INORDINATE SCANTNESS OF IT ALAS MAY NOT A MAN SEE IN OUR
DAYS THE SINFUL COSTLY ARRAY OF CLOTHING AND NAMELY SPECIALLY IN
TOO MUCH SUPERFLUITY OR ELSE IN TOO DISORDINATE SCANTNESS AS TO
THE FIRST SIN IN SUPERFLUITY OF CLOTHING WHICH THAT MAKETH IT SO
DEAR TO THE HARM OF THE PEOPLE NOT ONLY THE COST OF THE
EMBROIDERING THE DISGUISING INDENTING OR BARRING OUNDING
PALING 8 WINDING OR BANDING AND SEMBLABLE SIMILAR WASTE
OF CLOTH IN VANITY BUT THERE IS ALSO THE COSTLY FURRING LINING OR
EDGING WITH FUR IN THEIR GOWNS SO MUCH PUNCHING OF CHISELS TO
MAKE HOLES SO MUCH DAGGING CUTTING OF SHEARS WITH THE
SUPERFLUITY IN LENGTH OF THE FORESAID GOWNS TRAILING IN THE DUNG
AND IN THE MIRE ON HORSE AND EKE ON FOOT AS WELL OF MAN AS OF
WOMAN THAT ALL THAT TRAILING IS VERILY AS IN EFFECT WASTED
CONSUMED THREADBARE AND ROTTEN WITH DUNG RATHER THAN IT IS
GIVEN TO THE POOR TO GREAT DAMAGE OF THE FORESAID POOR FOLK
AND THAT IN SUNDRY WISE THIS IS TO SAY THE MORE THAT CLOTH IS
WASTED THE MORE MUST IT COST TO THE POOR PEOPLE FOR THE
SCARCENESS AND FURTHERMORE IF SO BE THAT THEY WOULD GIVE SUCH
PUNCHED AND DAGGED CLOTHING TO THE POOR PEOPLE IT IS NOT
CONVENIENT TO WEAR FOR THEIR ESTATE NOR SUFFICIENT TO BOOT HELP
REMEDY THEIR NECESSITY TO KEEP THEM FROM THE DISTEMPERANCE
INCLEMENCY OF THE FIRMAMENT
UPON THE OTHER SIDE TO SPEAK OF
THE HORRIBLE DISORDINATE SCANTNESS OF CLOTHING AS BE THESE CUTTED
SLOPS OR HANSELINES BREECHES THAT THROUGH THEIR SHORTNESS
COVER NOT THE SHAMEFUL MEMBER OF MAN TO WICKED INTENT ALAS
SOME OF THEM SHEW THE BOSS AND THE SHAPE OF THE HORRIBLE
SWOLLEN MEMBERS THAT SEEM LIKE TO THE MALADY OF HERNIA IN THE
WRAPPING OF THEIR HOSEN AND EKE THE BUTTOCKS OF THEM THAT FARE
AS IT WERE THE HINDER PART OF A SHE APE IN THE FULL OF THE MOON
AND MORE OVER THE WRETCHED SWOLLEN MEMBERS THAT THEY SHEW
THROUGH DISGUISING IN DEPARTING DIVIDING OF THEIR HOSEN IN
WHITE AND RED SEEMETH THAT HALF THEIR SHAMEFUL PRIVY MEMBERS
WERE FLAIN FLAYED
AND IF SO BE THAT THEY DEPART THEIR HOSEN IN
OTHER COLOURS AS IS WHITE AND BLUE OR WHITE AND BLACK OR BLACK
AND RED AND SO FORTH THEN SEEMETH IT BY VARIANCE OF COLOUR
THAT THE HALF PART OF THEIR PRIVY MEMBERS BE CORRUPT BY THE FIRE
OF SAINT ANTHONY OR BY CANKER OR OTHER SUCH MISCHANCE
AND
OF THE HINDER PART OF THEIR BUTTOCKS IT IS FULL HORRIBLE TO SEE FOR
CERTES IN THAT PART OF THEIR BODY WHERE THEY PURGE THEIR STINKING
ORDURE THAT FOUL PART SHEW THEY TO THE PEOPLE PROUDLY IN DESPITE
OF HONESTY DECENCY WHICH HONESTY JESUS CHRIST AND HIS FRIENDS
OBSERVED TO SHEW IN HIS LIFE
NOW AS OF THE OUTRAGEOUS ARRAY OF
WOMEN GOD WOT THAT THOUGH THE VISAGES OF SOME OF THEM
SEEM FULL CHASTE AND DEBONAIR GENTLE YET NOTIFY THEY IN THEIR
ARRAY OF ATTIRE LIKEROUSNESS AND PRIDE
I SAY NOT THAT HONESTY
REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE STYLE IN CLOTHING OF MAN OR WOMAN
UNCONVENABLE BUT CERTES THE SUPERFLUITY OR DISORDINATE SCARCITY
OF CLOTHING IS REPROVABLE
ALSO THE SIN OF THEIR ORNAMENT OR OF
APPAREL AS IN THINGS THAT APPERTAIN TO RIDING AS IN TOO MANY
DELICATE HORSES THAT BE HOLDEN FOR DELIGHT THAT BE SO FAIR FAT
AND COSTLY AND ALSO IN MANY A VICIOUS KNAVE SERVANT THAT IS
SUSTAINED BECAUSE OF THEM IN CURIOUS HARNESS AS IN SADDLES
CRUPPERS PEYTRELS BREAST PLATES AND BRIDLES COVERED WITH
PRECIOUS CLOTH AND RICH BARS AND PLATES OF GOLD AND SILVER
FOR
WHICH GOD SAITH BY ZECHARIAH THE PROPHET I WILL CONFOUND THE
RIDERS OF SUCH HORSES THESE FOLK TAKE LITTLE REGARD OF THE RIDING
OF GOD'S SON OF HEAVEN AND OF HIS HARNESS WHEN HE RODE UPON
AN ASS AND HAD NO OTHER HARNESS BUT THE POOR CLOTHES OF HIS
DISCIPLES NOR WE READ NOT THAT EVER HE RODE ON ANY OTHER BEAST
I SPEAK THIS FOR THE SIN OF SUPERFLUITY AND NOT FOR REASONABLE
HONESTY SEEMLINESS WHEN REASON IT REQUIRETH
AND MOREOVER
CERTES PRIDE IS GREATLY NOTIFIED IN HOLDING OF GREAT MEINIE
RETINUE OF SERVANTS WHEN THEY BE OF LITTLE PROFIT OR OF RIGHT NO
PROFIT AND NAMELY ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT MEINIE IS FELONOUS
VIOLENT AND DAMAGEOUS HARMFUL TO THE PEOPLE BY HARDINESS
ARROGANCE OF HIGH LORDSHIP OR BY WAY OF OFFICE FOR CERTES
SUCH LORDS SELL THEN THEIR LORDSHIP TO THE DEVIL OF HELL WHEN THEY
SUSTAIN THE WICKEDNESS OF THEIR MEINIE
OR ELSE WHEN THESE FOLK
OF LOW DEGREE AS THEY THAT HOLD HOSTELRIES SUSTAIN THEFT OF THEIR
HOSTELLERS AND THAT IS IN MANY MANNER OF DECEITS THAT MANNER OF
FOLK BE THE FLIES THAT FOLLOW THE HONEY OR ELSE THE HOUNDS THAT
FOLLOW THE CARRION
SUCH FORESAID FOLK STRANGLE SPIRITUALLY THEIR
LORDSHIPS FOR WHICH THUS SAITH DAVID THE PROPHET WICKED
DEATH MAY COME UNTO THESE LORDSHIPS AND GOD GIVE THAT THEY
MAY DESCEND INTO HELL ADOWN FOR IN THEIR HOUSES IS INIQUITY AND
SHREWEDNESS IMPIETY AND NOT GOD OF HEAVEN AND CERTES BUT
IF UNLESS THEY DO AMENDMENT RIGHT AS GOD GAVE HIS BENISON
BLESSING TO LABAN BY THE SERVICE OF JACOB AND TO PHARAOH BY
THE SERVICE OF JOSEPH RIGHT SO GOD WILL GIVE HIS MALISON
CONDEMNATION TO SUCH LORDSHIPS AS SUSTAIN THE WICKEDNESS OF
THEIR SERVANTS BUT UNLESS THEY COME TO AMENDMENT
PRIDE OF
THE TABLE APAIRETH WORKETH HARM EKE FULL OFT FOR CERTES RICH
MEN BE CALLED TO FEASTS AND POOR FOLK BE PUT AWAY AND REBUKED
ALSO IN EXCESS OF DIVERS MEATS AND DRINKS AND NAMELY SPECIALLY
SUCH MANNER BAKE MEATS AND DISH MEATS BURNING OF WILD FIRE
AND PAINTED AND CASTLED WITH PAPER AND SEMBLABLE SIMILAR
WASTE SO THAT IT IS ABUSE TO THINK
AND EKE IN TOO GREAT
PRECIOUSNESS OF VESSEL PLATE AND CURIOSITY OF MINSTRELSY BY
WHICH A MAN IS STIRRED MORE TO THE DELIGHTS OF LUXURY IF SO BE
THAT HE SET HIS HEART THE LESS UPON OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST CERTAIN
IT IS A SIN AND CERTAINLY THE DELIGHTS MIGHT BE SO GREAT IN THIS
CASE THAT A MAN MIGHT LIGHTLY EASILY FALL BY THEM INTO DEADLY
SIN
THE SINS THAT ARISE OF PRIDE ADVISEDLY AND HABITUALLY ARE DEADLY
THOSE THAT ARISE BY FRAILTY UNADVISED SUDDENLY AND SUDDENLY
WITHDRAW AGAIN THOUGH GRIEVOUS ARE NOT DEADLY
PRIDE ITSELF
SPRINGS SOMETIMES OF THE GOODS OF NATURE SOMETIMES OF THE
GOODS OF FORTUNE SOMETIMES OF THE GOODS OF GRACE BUT THE
PARSON ENUMERATING AND EXAMINING ALL THESE IN TURN POINTS OUT
HOW LITTLE SECURITY THEY POSSESS AND HOW LITTLE GROUND FOR PRIDE
THEY FURNISH AND GOES ON TO ENFORCE THE REMEDY AGAINST PRIDE
WHICH IS HUMILITY OR MEEKNESS A VIRTUE THROUGH WHICH A MAN
HATH TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF AND HOLDETH NO HIGH ESTEEM OF
HIMSELF IN REGARD OF HIS DESERTS CONSIDERING EVER HIS FRAILTY
NOW BE THERE THREE MANNERS KINDS OF HUMILITY AS HUMILITY IN
HEART AND ANOTHER IN THE MOUTH AND THE THIRD IN WORKS
THE
HUMILITY IN THE HEART IS IN FOUR MANNERS THE ONE IS WHEN A MAN
HOLDETH HIMSELF AS NOUGHT WORTH BEFORE GOD OF HEAVEN THE
SECOND IS WHEN HE DESPISETH NO OTHER MAN THE THIRD IS WHEN HE
RECKETH NOT THOUGH MEN HOLD HIM NOUGHT WORTH THE FOURTH IS
WHEN HE IS NOT SORRY OF HIS HUMILIATION
ALSO THE HUMILITY OF
MOUTH IS IN FOUR THINGS IN TEMPERATE SPEECH IN HUMILITY OF
SPEECH AND WHEN HE CONFESSETH WITH HIS OWN MOUTH THAT HE IS
SUCH AS HE THINKETH THAT HE IS IN HIS HEART ANOTHER IS WHEN HE
PRAISETH THE BOUNTE GOODNESS OF ANOTHER MAN AND NOTHING
THEREOF DIMINISHETH
HUMILITY EKE IN WORKS IS IN FOUR MANNERS
THE FIRST IS WHEN HE PUTTETH OTHER MEN BEFORE HIM THE SECOND IS
TO CHOOSE THE LOWEST PLACE OF ALL THE THIRD IS GLADLY TO ASSENT TO
GOOD COUNSEL THE FOURTH IS TO STAND GLADLY BY THE AWARD
JUDGMENT OF HIS SOVEREIGN OR OF HIM THAT IS HIGHER IN DEGREE
CERTAIN THIS IS A GREAT WORK OF HUMILITY
THE PARSON PROCEEDS TO TREAT OF THE OTHER CARDINAL SINS AND
THEIR REMEDIES 2 ENVY WITH ITS REMEDY THE LOVE OF GOD
PRINCIPALLY AND OF OUR NEIGHBOURS AS OURSELVES 3 ANGER WITH
ALL ITS FRUITS IN REVENGE RANCOUR HATE DISCORD MANSLAUGHTER
BLASPHEMY SWEARING FALSEHOOD FLATTERY CHIDING AND REPROVING
SCORNING TREACHERY SOWING OF STRIFE DOUBLENESS OF TONGUE
BETRAYING OF COUNSEL TO A MAN'S DISGRACE MENACING IDLE WORDS
JANGLING JAPERY OR BUFFOONERY C
AND ITS REMEDY IN THE
VIRTUES CALLED MANSUETUDE DEBONAIRTE OR GENTLENESS AND
PATIENCE OR SUFFERANCE 4 SLOTH OR ACCIDIE WHICH COMES
AFTER THE SIN OF ANGER BECAUSE ENVY BLINDS THE EYES OF A MAN
AND ANGER TROUBLETH A MAN AND SLOTH MAKETH HIM HEAVY
THOUGHTFUL AND PEEVISH
IT IS OPPOSED TO EVERY ESTATE OF MAN
AS UNFALLEN AND HELD TO WORK IN PRAISING AND ADORING GOD AS
SINFUL AND HELD TO LABOUR IN PRAYING FOR DELIVERANCE FROM SIN
AND AS IN THE STATE OF GRACE AND HELD TO WORKS OF PENITENCE
IT
RESEMBLES THE HEAVY AND SLUGGISH CONDITION OF THOSE IN HELL IT
WILL SUFFER NO HARDNESS AND NO PENANCE IT PREVENTS ANY
BEGINNING OF GOOD WORKS IT CAUSES DESPAIR OF GOD'S MERCY
WHICH IS THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST IT INDUCES SOMNOLENCY
AND NEGLECT OF COMMUNION IN PRAYER WITH GOD AND IT BREEDS
NEGLIGENCE OR RECKLESSNESS THAT CARES FOR NOTHING AND IS THE
NURSE OF ALL MISCHIEFS IF IGNORANCE IS THEIR MOTHER
AGAINST
SLOTH AND THESE AND OTHER BRANCHES AND FRUITS OF IT THE REMEDY
LIES IN THE VIRTUE OF FORTITUDE OR STRENGTH IN ITS VARIOUS SPECIES OF
MAGNANIMITY OR GREAT COURAGE FAITH AND HOPE IN GOD AND HIS
SAINTS SURETY OR SICKERNESS WHEN A MAN FEARS NOTHING THAT CAN
OPPOSE THE GOOD WORKS HE HAS UNDER TAKEN MAGNIFICENCE WHEN
HE CARRIES OUT GREAT WORKS OF GOODNESS BEGUN CONSTANCY OR
STABLENESS OF HEART AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO ENERGY AND LABORIOUS
SERVICE 5 AVARICE OR COVETOUSNESS WHICH IS THE ROOT OF ALL
HARMS SINCE ITS VOTARIES ARE IDOLATERS OPPRESSORS AND ENSLAVERS
OF MEN DECEIVERS OF THEIR EQUALS IN BUSINESS SIMONIACS
GAMBLERS LIARS THIEVES FALSE SWEARERS BLASPHEMERS MURDERERS
AND SACRILEGIOUS
ITS REMEDY LIES IN COMPASSION AND PITY LARGELY
EXERCISED AND IN REASONABLE LIBERALITY FOR THOSE WHO SPEND ON
FOOL LARGESSE OR OSTENTATION OF WORLDLY ESTATE AND LUXURY
SHALL RECEIVE THE MALISON CONDEMNATION THAT CHRIST SHALL GIVE
AT THE DAY OF DOOM TO THEM THAT SHALL BE DAMNED 6 GLUTTONY
OF WHICH THE PARSON TREATS SO BRIEFLY THAT THE CHAPTER MAY BE
GIVEN IN FULL
AFTER AVARICE COMETH GLUTTONY WHICH IS EXPRESS AGAINST THE
COMMANDMENT OF GOD
GLUTTONY IS UNMEASURABLE APPETITE TO EAT
OR TO DRINK OR ELSE TO DO IN AUGHT TO THE UNMEASURABLE APPETITE
AND DISORDERED COVETOUSNESS CRAVING TO EAT OR DRINK
THIS SIN
CORRUPTED ALL THIS WORLD AS IS WELL SHEWED IN THE SIN OF ADAM
AND OF EVE
LOOK ALSO WHAT SAITH SAINT PAUL OF GLUTTONY
MANY SAITH HE GO OF WHICH I HAVE OFT SAID TO YOU AND NOW
I SAY IT WEEPING THAT THEY BE ENEMIES OF THE CROSS OF CHRIST OF
WHICH THE END IS DEATH AND OF WHICH THEIR WOMB STOMACH IS
THEIR GOD AND THEIR GLORY IN CONFUSION OF THEM THAT SO SAVOUR
TAKE DELIGHT IN EARTHLY THINGS
HE THAT IS USANT ACCUSTOMED
ADDICTED TO THIS SIN OF GLUTTONY HE MAY NO SIN WITHSTAND HE
MUST BE IN SERVAGE BONDAGE OF ALL VICES FOR IT IS THE DEVIL'S
HOARD LAIR LURKING PLACE WHERE HE HIDETH HIM IN AND RESTETH
THIS SIN HATH MANY SPECIES
THE FIRST IS DRUNKENNESS THAT IS THE
HORRIBLE SEPULTURE OF MAN'S REASON AND THEREFORE WHEN A MAN IS
DRUNKEN HE HATH LOST HIS REASON AND THIS IS DEADLY SIN
BUT
SOOTHLY WHEN THAT A MAN IS NOT WONT TO STRONG DRINK AND
PERADVENTURE KNOWETH NOT THE STRENGTH OF THE DRINK OR HATH
FEEBLENESS IN HIS HEAD OR HATH TRAVAILED LABOURED THROUGH
WHICH HE DRINKETH THE MORE ALL ALTHOUGH BE HE SUDDENLY
CAUGHT WITH DRINK IT IS NO DEADLY SIN BUT VENIAL
THE SECOND
SPECIES OF GLUTTONY IS THAT THE SPIRIT OF A MAN WAXETH ALL
TROUBLED FOR DRUNKENNESS AND BEREAVETH A MAN THE DISCRETION OF
HIS WIT
THE THIRD SPECIES OF GLUTTONY IS WHEN A MAN DEVOURETH
HIS MEAT AND HATH NO RIGHTFUL MANNER OF EATING
THE FOURTH IS
WHEN THROUGH THE GREAT ABUNDANCE OF HIS MEAT THE HUMOURS OF
HIS BODY BE DISTEMPERED
THE FIFTH IS FORGETFULNESS BY TOO MUCH
DRINKING FOR WHICH A MAN SOMETIMES FORGETTETH BY THE MORROW
WHAT BE DID AT EVE
IN OTHER MANNER BE DISTINCT THE SPECIES OF
GLUTTONY AFTER SAINT GREGORY
THE FIRST IS FOR TO EAT OR DRINK
BEFORE TIME
THE SECOND IS WHEN A MAN GETTETH HIM TOO DELICATE
MEAT OR DRINK
THE THIRD IS WHEN MEN TAKE TOO MUCH OVER
MEASURE IMMODERATELY
THE FOURTH IS CURIOSITY NICETY WITH
GREAT INTENT APPLICATION PAINS TO MAKE AND APPAREL PREPARE
HIS MEAT
THE FIFTH IS FOR TO EAT TOO GREEDILY
THESE BE THE FIVE
FINGERS OF THE DEVIL'S HAND BY WHICH HE DRAWETH FOLK TO THE SIN
AGAINST GLUTTONY THE REMEDY IS ABSTINENCE AS SAITH GALEN BUT
THAT I HOLD NOT MERITORIOUS IF HE DO IT ONLY FOR THE HEALTH OF HIS
BODY
SAINT AUGUSTINE WILL THAT ABSTINENCE BE DONE FOR VIRTUE
AND WITH PATIENCE
ABSTINENCE SAITH HE IS LITTLE WORTH BUT IF
UNLESS A MAN HAVE GOOD WILL THERETO AND BUT IT BE ENFORCED BY
PATIENCE AND BY CHARITY AND THAT MEN DO IT FOR GOD'S SAKE AND
IN HOPE TO HAVE THE BLISS IN HEAVEN
THE FELLOWS OF ABSTINENCE BE
TEMPERANCE THAT HOLDETH THE MEAN IN ALL THINGS ALSO SHAME THAT
ESCHEWETH ALL DISHONESTY INDECENCY IMPROPRIETY SUFFICIENCY
THAT SEEKETH NO RICH MEATS NOR DRINKS NOR DOTH NO FORCE OF SETS
NO VALUE ON NO OUTRAGEOUS APPARELLING OF MEAT MEASURE
MODERATION ALSO THAT RESTRAINETH BY REASON THE UNMEASURABLE
APPETITE OF EATING SOBERNESS ALSO THAT RESTRAINETH THE OUTRAGE OF
DRINK SPARING ALSO THAT RESTRAINETH THE DELICATE EASE TO SIT LONG
AT MEAT WHEREFORE SOME FOLK STAND OF THEIR OWN WILL TO EAT
BECAUSE THEY WILL EAT AT LESS LEISURE
AT GREAT LENGTH THE PARSON THEN POINTS OUT THE MANY VARIETIES OF
THE SIN OF 7 LECHERY AND ITS REMEDY IN CHASTITY AND
CONTINENCE ALIKE IN MARRIAGE AND IN WIDOWHOOD ALSO IN THE
ABSTAINING FROM ALL SUCH INDULGENCES OF EATING DRINKING AND
SLEEPING AS INFLAME THE PASSIONS AND FROM THE COMPANY OF ALL
WHO MAY TEMPT TO THE SIN
MINUTE GUIDANCE IS GIVEN AS TO THE
DUTY OF CONFESSING FULLY AND FAITHFULLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT
ATTEND AND MAY AGGRAVATE THIS SIN AND THE TREATISE THEN PASSES
TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO A TRUE
AND PROFITABLE CONFESSION OF SIN IN GENERAL
FIRST IT MUST BE IN
SORROWFUL BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT A CONDITION THAT HAS FIVE SIGNS
SHAMEFASTNESS HUMILITY IN HEART AND OUTWARD SIGN WEEPING WITH
THE BODILY EYES OR IN THE HEART DISREGARD OF THE SHAME THAT
MIGHT CURTAIL OR GARBLE CONFESSION AND OBEDIENCE TO THE PENANCE
ENJOINED
SECONDLY TRUE CONFESSION MUST BE PROMPTLY MADE FOR
DREAD OF DEATH OF INCREASE OF SINFULNESS OF FORGETFULNESS OF
WHAT SHOULD BE CONFESSED OF CHRIST'S REFUSAL TO HEAR IF IT BE PUT
OFF TO THE LAST DAY OF LIFE AND THIS CONDITION HAS FOUR TERMS THAT
CONFESSION BE WELL PONDERED BEFOREHAND THAT THE MAN
CONFESSING HAVE COMPREHENDED IN HIS MIND THE NUMBER AND
GREATNESS OF HIS SINS AND HOW LONG HE HAS LAIN IN SIN THAT HE BE
CONTRITE FOR AND ESCHEW HIS SINS AND THAT HE FEAR AND FLEE THE
OCCASIONS FOR THAT SIN TO WHICH HE IS INCLINED
WHAT FOLLOWS
UNDER THIS HEAD IS OF SOME INTEREST FOR THE LIGHT WHICH IT THROWS
ON THE RIGOROUS GOVERNMENT WIELDED BY THE ROMISH CHURCH IN
THOSE DAYS
ALSO THOU SHALT SHRIVE THEE OF ALL THY SINS TO ONE MAN AND NOT A
PARCEL PORTION TO ONE MAN AND A PARCEL TO ANOTHER THAT IS TO
UNDERSTAND IN INTENT TO DEPART DIVIDE THY CONFESSION FOR SHAME
OR DREAD FOR IT IS BUT STRANGLING OF THY SOUL
FOR CERTES JESUS
CHRIST IS ENTIRELY ALL GOOD IN HIM IS NONE IMPERFECTION AND
THEREFORE EITHER HE FORGIVETH ALL PERFECTLY OR ELSE NEVER A DEAL
NOT AT ALL
I SAY NOT THAT IF THOU BE ASSIGNED TO THY PENITENCER
9 FOR A CERTAIN SIN THAT THOU ART BOUND TO SHEW HIM ALL THE
REMNANT OF THY SINS OF WHICH THOU HAST BEEN SHRIVEN OF THY
CURATE BUT IF IT LIKE THEE UNLESS THOU BE PLEASED OF THY
HUMILITY THIS IS NO DEPARTING DIVISION OF SHRIFT
AND I SAY NOT
WHERE I SPEAK OF DIVISION OF CONFESSION THAT IF THOU HAVE LICENSE
TO SHRIVE THEE TO A DISCREET AND AN HONEST PRIEST AND WHERE THEE
LIKETH AND BY THE LICENSE OF THY CURATE THAT THOU MAYEST NOT
WELL SHRIVE THEE TO HIM OF ALL THY SINS BUT LET NO BLOT BE BEHIND
LET NO SIN BE UNTOLD AS FAR AS THOU HAST REMEMBRANCE
AND WHEN
THOU SHALT BE SHRIVEN OF THY CURATE TELL HIM EKE ALL THE SINS THAT
THOU HAST DONE SINCE THOU WERT LAST SHRIVEN
THIS IS NO WICKED
INTENT OF DIVISION OF SHRIFT
ALSO VERY SHRIFT TRUE CONFESSION
ASKETH CERTAIN CONDITIONS
FIRST THAT THOU SHRIVE THEE BY THY
FREE WILL NOT CONSTRAINED NOR FOR SHAME OF FOLK NOR FOR MALADY
SICKNESS OR SUCH THINGS FOR IT IS REASON THAT HE THAT
TRESPASSETH BY HIS FREE WILL THAT BY HIS FREE WILL HE CONFESS HIS
TRESPASS AND THAT NO OTHER MAN TELL HIS SIN BUT HIMSELF NOR HE
SHALL NOT NAY NOR DENY HIS SIN NOR WRATH HIM AGAINST THE PRIEST
FOR ADMONISHING HIM TO LEAVE HIS SIN
THE SECOND CONDITION IS
THAT THY SHRIFT BE LAWFUL THAT IS TO SAY THAT THOU THAT SHRIVEST
THEE AND EKE THE PRIEST THAT HEARETH THY CONFESSION BE VERILY IN
THE FAITH OF HOLY CHURCH AND THAT A MAN BE NOT DESPAIRED OF THE
MERCY OF JESUS CHRIST AS CAIN AND JUDAS WERE
AND EKE A MAN
MUST ACCUSE HIMSELF OF HIS OWN TRESPASS AND NOT ANOTHER BUT HE
SHALL BLAME AND WITE ACCUSE HIMSELF OF HIS OWN MALICE AND OF
HIS SIN AND NONE OTHER BUT NEVERTHELESS IF THAT ANOTHER MAN BE
OCCASION OR ELSE ENTICER OF HIS SIN OR THE ESTATE OF THE PERSON BE
SUCH BY WHICH HIS SIN IS AGGRAVATED OR ELSE THAT BE MAY NOT
PLAINLY SHRIVE HIM BUT UNLESS HE TELL THE PERSON WITH WHICH HE
HATH SINNED THEN MAY HE TELL SO THAT HIS INTENT BE NOT TO
BACKBITE THE PERSON BUT ONLY TO DECLARE HIS CONFESSION
THOU
SHALT NOT EKE MAKE NO LEASINGS FALSEHOODS IN THY CONFESSION
FOR HUMILITY PERADVENTURE TO SAY THAT THOU HAST COMMITTED AND
DONE SUCH SINS OF WHICH THAT THOU WERT NEVER GUILTY
FOR SAINT
AUGUSTINE SAITH IF THAT THOU BECAUSE OF HUMILITY MAKEST A
LEASING ON THYSELF THOUGH THOU WERE NOT IN SIN BEFORE YET ART
THOU THEN IN SIN THROUGH THY LEASING THOU MUST ALSO SHEW THY
SIN BY THINE OWN PROPER MOUTH BUT UNLESS THOU BE DUMB AND
NOT BY LETTER FOR THOU THAT HAST DONE THE SIN THOU SHALT HAVE THE
SHAME OF THE CONFESSION
THOU SHALT NOT PAINT THY CONFESSION
WITH FAIR AND SUBTLE WORDS TO COVER THE MORE THY SIN FOR THEN
BEGUILEST THOU THYSELF AND NOT THE PRIEST THOU MUST TELL IT
PLAINLY BE IT NEVER SO FOUL NOR SO HORRIBLE
THOU SHALT EKE SHRIVE
THEE TO A PRIEST THAT IS DISCREET TO COUNSEL THEE AND EKE THOU
SHALT NOT SHRIVE THEE FOR VAIN GLORY NOR FOR HYPOCRISY NOR FOR
NO CAUSE BUT ONLY FOR THE DOUBT FEAR OF JESUS' CHRIST AND THE
HEALTH OF THY SOUL
THOU SHALT NOT RUN TO THE PRIEST ALL SUDDENLY
TO TELL HIM LIGHTLY THY SIN AS WHO TELLETH A JAPE JEST OR A TALE
BUT ADVISEDLY AND WITH GOOD DEVOTION AND GENERALLY SHRIVE THEE
OFT IF THOU OFT FALL OFT ARISE BY CONFESSION
AND THOUGH THOU
SHRIVE THEE OFTENER THAN ONCE OF SIN OF WHICH THOU HAST BEEN
SHRIVEN IT IS MORE MERIT AND AS SAITH SAINT AUGUSTINE THOU
SHALT HAVE THE MORE LIGHTLY EASILY RELEASE AND GRACE OF GOD
BOTH OF SIN AND OF PAIN
AND CERTES ONCE A YEAR AT THE LEAST WAY
IT IS LAWFUL TO BE HOUSELED 10 FOR SOOTHLY ONCE A YEAR ALL
THINGS IN THE EARTH RENOVELEN RENEW THEMSELVES
HERE ENDS THE SECOND PART OF THE TREATISE THE THIRD PART
WHICH CONTAINS THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE WHOLE FOLLOWS
ENTIRE ALONG WITH THE REMARKABLE PRAYER OF CHAUCER AS IT
STANDS IN THE HARLEIAN MANUSCRIPT
DE TERTIA PARTE POENITENTIAE
OF THE THIRD PART OF PENITENCE
NOW HAVE I TOLD YOU OF VERY TRUE CONFESSION THAT IS THE
SECOND PART OF PENITENCE THE THIRD PART OF PENITENCE IS
SATISFACTION AND THAT STANDETH GENERALLY IN ALMSDEED AND BODILY
PAIN
NOW BE THERE THREE MANNER OF ALMSDEED CONTRITION OF
HEART WHERE A MAN OFFERETH HIMSELF TO GOD THE SECOND IS TO
HAVE PITY OF THE DEFAULT OF HIS NEIGHBOUR THE THIRD IS IN GIVING
OF GOOD COUNSEL AND COMFORT GHOSTLY AND BODILY WHERE MEN
HAVE NEED AND NAMELY SPECIALLY SUSTENANCE OF MAN'S FOOD
AND TAKE KEEP HEED THAT A MAN HATH NEED OF THESE THINGS
GENERALLY HE HATH NEED OF FOOD OF CLOTHING AND OF HERBEROW
LODGING HE HATH NEED OF CHARITABLE COUNSEL AND VISITING IN
PRISON AND MALADY AND SEPULTURE OF HIS DEAD BODY
AND IF THOU
MAYEST NOT VISIT THE NEEDFUL WITH THY PERSON VISIT THEM BY THY
MESSAGE AND BY THY GIFTS
THESE BE GENERALLY ALMS OR WORKS OF
CHARITY OF THEM THAT HAVE TEMPORAL RICHES OR DISCRETION IN
COUNSELLING
OF THESE WORKS SHALT THOU HEAR AT THE DAY OF DOOM
THIS ALMS SHOULDEST THOU DO OF THINE OWN PROPER THINGS AND
HASTILY PROMPTLY AND PRIVILY SECRETLY IF THOU MAYEST BUT
NEVERTHELESS IF THOU MAYEST NOT DO IT PRIVILY THOU SHALT NOT
FORBEAR TO DO ALMS THOUGH MEN SEE IT SO THAT IT BE NOT DONE FOR
THANK OF THE WORLD BUT ONLY FOR THANK OF JESUS CHRIST
FOR AS
WITNESSETH SAINT MATTHEW CHAP
V A CITY MAY NOT BE HID THAT
IS SET ON A MOUNTAIN NOR MEN LIGHT NOT A LANTERN AND PUT IT
UNDER A BUSHEL BUT MEN SET IT ON A CANDLESTICK TO LIGHT THE MEN
IN THE HOUSE RIGHT SO SHALL YOUR LIGHT LIGHTEN BEFORE MEN THAT
THEY MAY SEE YOUR GOOD WORKS AND GLORIFY YOUR FATHER THAT IS
IN HEAVEN
NOW AS TO SPEAK OF BODILY PAIN IT IS IN PRAYER IN WAKINGS
WATCHINGS IN FASTINGS AND IN VIRTUOUS TEACHINGS
OF ORISONS YE
SHALL UNDERSTAND THAT ORISONS OR PRAYERS IS TO SAY A PITEOUS WILL
OF HEART THAT REDRESSETH IT IN GOD AND EXPRESSETH IT BY WORD
OUTWARD TO REMOVE HARMS AND TO HAVE THINGS SPIRITUAL AND
DURABLE AND SOMETIMES TEMPORAL THINGS
OF WHICH ORISONS
CERTES IN THE ORISON OF THE PATER NOSTER HATH OUR LORD JESUS
CHRIST ENCLOSED MOST THINGS
CERTES IT IS PRIVILEGED OF THREE
THINGS IN ITS DIGNITY FOR WHICH IT IS MORE DIGNE WORTHY THAN
ANY OTHER PRAYER FOR JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF MADE IT AND IT IS
SHORT FOR IN ORDER IT SHOULD BE COUDE THE MORE LIGHTLY BE
MORE EASILY CONNED OR LEARNED AND TO WITHHOLD RETAIN IT THE
MORE EASY IN HEART AND HELP HIMSELF THE OFTENER WITH THIS ORISON
AND FOR A MAN SHOULD BE THE LESS WEARY TO SAY IT AND FOR A MAN
MAY NOT EXCUSE HIM TO LEARN IT IT IS SO SHORT AND SO EASY AND
FOR IT COMPREHENDETH IN ITSELF ALL GOOD PRAYERS
THE EXPOSITION
OF THIS HOLY PRAYER THAT IS SO EXCELLENT AND SO DIGNE I BETAKE
COMMIT TO THESE MASTERS OF THEOLOGY SAVE THUS MUCH WILL I
SAY WHEN THOU PRAYEST THAT GOD SHOULD FORGIVE THEE THY GUILTS
AS THOU FORGIVEST THEM THAT THEY GUILT TO THEE BE FULL WELL WARE
THAT THOU BE NOT OUT OF CHARITY
THIS HOLY ORISON AMINISHETH
LESSENETH EKE VENIAL SIN AND THEREFORE IT APPERTAINETH SPECIALLY
TO PENITENCE
THIS PRAYER MUST BE TRULY SAID AND IN VERY FAITH
AND THAT MEN PRAY TO GOD ORDINATELY DISCREETLY AND DEVOUTLY
AND ALWAYS A MAN SHALL PUT HIS WILL TO BE SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF
GOD
THIS ORISON MUST EKE BE SAID WITH GREAT HUMBLENESS AND
FULL PURE AND HONESTLY AND NOT TO THE ANNOYANCE OF ANY MAN OR
WOMAN
IT MUST EKE BE CONTINUED WITH THE WORKS OF CHARITY
IT
AVAILETH AGAINST THE VICES OF THE SOUL FOR ASSAITH SAINT JEROME
BY FASTING BE SAVED THE VICES OF THE FLESH AND BY PRAYER THE
VICES OF THE SOUL
AFTER THIS THOU SHALT UNDERSTAND THAT BODILY PAIN STANDS IN
WAKING WATCHING
FOR JESUS CHRIST SAITH WAKE AND PRAY THAT
YE ENTER NOT INTO TEMPTATION YE SHALL UNDERSTAND ALSO THAT
FASTING STANDS IN THREE THINGS IN FORBEARING OF BODILY MEAT AND
DRINK AND IN FORBEARING OF WORLDLY JOLLITY AND IN FORBEARING OF
DEADLY SIN THIS IS TO SAY THAT A MAN SHALL KEEP HIM FROM DEADLY
SIN IN ALL THAT HE MAY
AND THOU SHALT UNDERSTAND EKE THAT GOD
ORDAINED FASTING AND TO FASTING APPERTAIN FOUR THINGS LARGENESS
GENEROSITY TO POOR FOLK GLADNESS OF HEART SPIRITUAL NOT TO BE
ANGRY NOR ANNOYED NOR GRUDGE MURMUR FOR HE FASTETH AND ALSO
REASONABLE HOUR FOR TO EAT BY MEASURE THAT IS TO SAY A MAN
SHOULD NOT EAT IN UNTIME OUT OF TIME NOR SIT THE LONGER AT HIS
MEAL FOR BECAUSE HE FASTETH
THEN SHALT THOU UNDERSTAND THAT
BODILY PAIN STANDETH IN DISCIPLINE OR TEACHING BY WORD OR BY
WRITING OR BY ENSAMPLE
ALSO IN WEARING OF HAIRS HAIRCLOTH OR
OF STAMIN COARSE HEMPEN CLOTH OR OF HABERGEONS MAIL SHIRTS
11 ON THEIR NAKED FLESH FOR CHRIST'S SAKE BUT WARE THEE WELL
THAT SUCH MANNER PENANCE OF THY FLESH MAKE NOT THINE HEART
BITTER OR ANGRY NOR ANNOYED OF THYSELF FOR BETTER IS TO CAST AWAY
THINE HAIR THAN TO CAST AWAY THE SWEETNESS OF OUR LORD JESUS
CHRIST
AND THEREFORE SAITH SAINT PAUL CLOTHE YOU AS THEY THAT
BE CHOSEN OF GOD IN HEART OF MISERICORDE WITH COMPASSION
DEBONAIRTE GENTLENESS SUFFERANCE PATIENCE AND SUCH MANNER
OF CLOTHING OF WHICH JESUS CHRIST IS MORE APAID BETTER
PLEASED THAN OF HAIRS OR OF HAUBERKS
THEN IS DISCIPLINE EKE IN
KNOCKING OF THY BREAST IN SCOURGING WITH YARDS RODS IN
KNEELINGS IN TRIBULATIONS IN SUFFERING PATIENTLY WRONGS THAT BE
DONE TO HIM AND EKE IN PATIENT SUFFERANCE OF MALADIES OR LOSING
OF WORLDLY CATEL CHATTELS OR OF WIFE OR OF CHILD OR OF OTHER
FRIENDS
THEN SHALT THOU UNDERSTAND WHICH THINGS DISTURB PENANCE AND
THIS IS IN FOUR THINGS THAT IS DREAD SHAME HOPE AND WANHOPE
THAT IS DESPERATION
AND FOR TO SPEAK FIRST OF DREAD FOR WHICH
HE WEENETH THAT HE MAY SUFFER NO PENANCE THEREAGAINST IS
REMEDY FOR TO THINK THAT BODILY PENANCE IS BUT SHORT AND LITTLE AT
THE REGARD OF IN COMPARISON WITH THE PAIN OF HELL THAT IS SO
CRUEL AND SO LONG THAT IT LASTETH WITHOUT END
NOW AGAINST THE
SHAME THAT A MAN HATH TO SHRIVE HIM AND NAMELY SPECIALLY
THESE HYPOCRITES THAT WOULD BE HOLDEN SO PERFECT THAT THEY
HAVE NO NEED TO SHRIVE THEM AGAINST THAT SHAME SHOULD A MAN
THINK THAT BY WAY OF REASON HE THAT HATH NOT BEEN ASHAMED TO
DO FOUL THINGS CERTES HE OUGHT NOT TO BE ASHAMED TO DO FAIR
THINGS AND THAT IS CONFESSION
A MAN SHOULD EKE THINK THAT GOD
SEETH AND KNOWETH ALL THY THOUGHTS AND ALL THY WORKS TO HIM
MAY NOTHING BE HID NOR COVERED
MEN SHOULD EKE REMEMBER
THEM OF THE SHAME THAT IS TO COME AT THE DAY OF DOOM TO THEM
THAT BE NOT PENITENT AND SHRIVEN IN THIS PRESENT LIFE FOR ALL THE
CREATURES IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH AND IN HELL SHALL SEE APERTLY
OPENLY ALL THAT HE HIDETH IN THIS WORLD
NOW FOR TO SPEAK OF THEM THAT BE SO NEGLIGENT AND SLOW TO
SHRIVE THEM THAT STANDS IN TWO MANNERS
THE ONE IS THAT HE
HOPETH TO LIVE LONG AND TO PURCHASE ACQUIRE MUCH RICHES FOR
HIS DELIGHT AND THEN HE WILL SHRIVE HIM AND AS HE SAYETH HE
MAY AS HIM SEEMETH TIMELY ENOUGH COME TO SHRIFT ANOTHER IS
THE SURQUEDRIE PRESUMPTION 12 THAT HE HATH IN CHRIST'S
MERCY
AGAINST THE FIRST VICE HE SHALL THINK THAT OUR LIFE IS IN NO
SICKERNESS SECURITY AND EKE THAT ALL THE RICHES IN THIS WORLD BE
IN ADVENTURE AND PASS AS A SHADOW ON THE WALL AND AS SAITH ST
GREGORY THAT IT APPERTAINETH TO THE GREAT RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD
THAT NEVER SHALL THE PAIN STINT CEASE OF THEM THAT NEVER WOULD
WITHDRAW THEM FROM SIN THEIR THANKS WITH THEIR GOODWILL BUT
AYE CONTINUE IN SIN FOR THAT PERPETUAL WILL TO DO SIN SHALL THEY
HAVE PERPETUAL PAIN
WANHOPE DESPAIR IS IN TWO MANNERS OF
TWO KINDS
THE FIRST WANHOPE IS IN THE MERCY OF GOD THE OTHER
IS THAT THEY THINK THEY MIGHT NOT LONG PERSEVERE IN GOODNESS
THE FIRST WANHOPE COMETH OF THAT HE DEEMETH THAT HE SINNED SO
HIGHLY AND SO OFT AND SO LONG HATH LAIN IN SIN THAT HE SHALL NOT
BE SAVED
CERTES AGAINST THAT CURSED WANHOPE SHOULD HE THINK
THAT THE PASSION OF JESUS CHRIST IS MORE STRONG FOR TO UNBIND
THAN SIN IS STRONG FOR TO BIND
AGAINST THE SECOND WANHOPE HE
SHALL THINK THAT AS OFT AS HE FALLETH HE MAY ARISE AGAIN BY
PENITENCE AND THOUGH HE NEVER SO LONG HATH LAIN IN SIN THE
MERCY OF CHRIST IS ALWAYS READY TO RECEIVE HIM TO MERCY
AGAINST THE WANHOPE THAT HE THINKETH HE SHOULD NOT LONG
PERSEVERE IN GOODNESS HE SHALL THINK THAT THE FEEBLENESS OF THE
DEVIL MAY NOTHING DO BUT UNLESS MEN WILL SUFFER HIM AND EKE
HE SHALL HAVE STRENGTH OF THE HELP OF GOD AND OF ALL HOLY
CHURCH AND OF THE PROTECTION OF ANGELS IF HIM LIST
THEN SHALL MEN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE FRUIT OF PENANCE AND
AFTER THE WORD OF JESUS CHRIST IT IS THE ENDLESS BLISS OF HEAVEN
WHERE JOY HATH NO CONTRARIETY OF WOE NOR OF PENANCE NOR
GRIEVANCE THERE ALL HARMS BE PASSED OF THIS PRESENT LIFE THERE AS
IS THE SICKERNESS SECURITY FROM THE PAIN OF HELL THERE AS IS THE
BLISSFUL COMPANY THAT REJOICE THEM EVERMORE EACH OF THE OTHER'S
JOY THERE AS THE BODY OF MAN THAT WHILOM WAS FOUL AND DARK IS
MORE CLEAR THAN THE SUN THERE AS THE BODY OF MAN THAT WHILOM
WAS SICK AND FRAIL FEEBLE AND MORTAL IS IMMORTAL AND SO STRONG
AND SO WHOLE THAT THERE MAY NOTHING APAIR IMPAIR INJURE IT
THERE IS NEITHER HUNGER NOR THIRST NOR COLD BUT EVERY SOUL
REPLENISHED WITH THE SIGHT OF THE PERFECT KNOWING OF GOD
THIS
BLISSFUL REGNE KINGDOM MAY MEN PURCHASE BY POVERTY SPIRITUAL
AND THE GLORY BY LOWLINESS THE PLENTY OF JOY BY HUNGER AND
THIRST THE REST BY TRAVAIL AND THE LIFE BY DEATH AND MORTIFICATION
OF SIN TO WHICH LIFE HE US BRING THAT BOUGHT US WITH HIS
PRECIOUS BLOOD AMEN
NOTES TO THE PARSON'S TALE
1
THE PARSON'S TALE IS BELIEVED TO BE A TRANSLATION MORE OR LESS
FREE FROM SOME TREATISE ON PENITENCE THAT WAS IN FAVOUR ABOUT
CHAUCER'S TIME
TYRWHITT SAYS I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT AS A VERY
ENTERTAINING OR EDIFYING PERFORMANCE AT THIS DAY BUT THE READER
WILL PLEASE TO REMEMBER IN EXCUSE BOTH OF CHAUCER AND OF HIS
EDITOR THAT CONSIDERING THE CANTERBURY TALES AS A GREAT PICTURE
OF LIFE AND MANNERS THE PIECE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETE IF
IT HAD NOT INCLUDED THE RELIGION OF THE TIME THE EDITOR OF THE
PRESENT VOLUME HAS FOLLOWED THE SAME PLAN ADOPTED WITH REGARD
TO CHAUCER'S TALE OF MELIBOEUS AND MAINLY FOR THE SAME
REASONS

NOTES TO THE PRAYER OF CHAUCER
1
THE GENUINENESS AND REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PRAYER OF
CHAUCER USUALLY CALLED HIS RETRACTATION HAVE BEEN WARMLY
DISPUTED
ON THE ONE HAND IT HAS BEEN DECLARED THAT THE MONKS
FORGED THE RETRACTATION
AND PROCURED ITS INSERTION AMONG THE
WORKS OF THE MAN WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH TO EXPOSE THEIR ABUSES
AND IGNORANCE AND TO WEAKEN THEIR HOLD ON POPULAR CREDULITY
ON THE OTHER HAND CHAUCER HIMSELF AT THE CLOSE OF HIS LIFE IS
SAID TO HAVE GREATLY LAMENTED THE RIBALDRY AND THE ATTACKS ON THE
CLERGY WHICH MARKED ESPECIALLY THE CANTERBURY TALES AND TO
HAVE DRAWN UP A FORMAL RETRACTATION OF WHICH THE PRAYER IS
EITHER A COPY OR AN ABRIDGMENT
THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE
PRAYER AS TYRWHITT POINTS OUT ARE IN TONE AND TERMS QUITE
APPROPRIATE IN THE MOUTH OF THE PARSON WHILE THEY CARRY ON THE
SUBJECT OF WHICH HE HAS BEEN TREATING AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT
MR WRIGHT HOLDS THE CONTRARY OPINION TYRWHITT SEEMS TO BE
JUSTIFIED IN SETTING DOWN THE RETRACTATION AS INTERPOLATED INTO
THE CLOSE OF THE PARSON'S TALE
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER
WHICH THE INTERPOLATION WAS MADE OR THE CAUSES BY WHICH IT WAS
DICTATED LITTLE OR NOTHING CAN NOW BE CONFIDENTLY AFFIRMED BUT
THE AGREEMENT OF THE MANUSCRIPTS AND THE EARLY EDITIONS IN
GIVING IT RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCARD IT PEREMPTORILY AS A
DECLARATION OF PRUDISH OR OF INTERESTED REGRET WITH WHICH
CHAUCER HIMSELF HAD NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO
2
YOU WHO WITH THE FATHER AND THE HOLY SPIRIT LIVEST AND
REIGNEST GOD FOR EVER AND EVER
AMEN
THE END OF THE CANTERBURY TALES
THE COURT OF LOVE
THE COURT OF LOVE WAS PROBABLY CHAUCER'S FIRST POEM OF ANY
CONSEQUENCE
IT IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AT THE AGE AND
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH IT CONTAINS EXPRESS MENTION
THAT IS WHEN THE POET WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND RESIDED AS A
STUDENT AT CAMBRIDGE ABOUT THE YEAR 1346
THE COMPOSITION
IS MARKED BY AN ELEGANCE CARE AND FINISH VERY DIFFERENT FROM
THE BOLD FREEDOM WHICH IN SO GREAT MEASURE DISTINGUISHES THE
CANTERBURY TALES AND THE FACT IS EASILY EXPLAINED WHEN WE
REMEMBER THAT IN THE EARLIER POEM CHAUCER FOLLOWED A BEATEN
PATH IN WHICH HE HAD MANY PREDECESSORS AND COMPETITORS ALL
SEEKING TO SOUND THE PRAISES OF LOVE WITH THE GRACE THE
INGENUITY AND STUDIOUS DEVOTION APPROPRIATE TO THE THEME
THE
STORY OF THE POEM IS EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE
UNDER THE NAME OF
PHILOGENET A CLERK OR SCHOLAR OF CAMBRIDGE THE POET RELATES
THAT SUMMONED BY MERCURY TO THE COURT OF LOVE HE JOURNEYS
TO THE SPLENDID CASTLE WHERE THE KING AND QUEEN OF LOVE
ADMETUS AND ALCESTIS KEEP THEIR STATE
DISCOVERING AMONG THE
COURTIERS A FRIEND NAMED PHILOBONE A CHAMBERWOMAN TO THE
QUEEN PHILOGENET IS LED BY HER INTO A CIRCULAR TEMPLE WHERE IN
A TABERNACLE SITS VENUS WITH CUPID BY HER SIDE
WHILE HE IS
SURVEYING THE MOTLEY CROWD OF SUITORS TO THE GODDESS
PHILOGENET IS SUMMONED BACK INTO THE KING'S PRESENCE CHIDDEN
FOR HIS TARDINESS IN COMING TO COURT AND COMMANDED TO SWEAR
OBSERVANCE TO THE TWENTY STATUTES OF LOVE WHICH ARE RECITED
AT LENGTH
PHILOGENET THEN MAKES HIS PRAYERS AND VOWS TO
VENUS DESIRING THAT HE MAY HAVE FOR HIS LOVE A LADY WHOM HE
HAS SEEN IN A DREAM AND PHILOBONE INTRODUCES HIM TO THE LADY
HERSELF NAMED ROSIAL TO WHOM HE DOES SUIT AND SERVICE OF LOVE
AT FIRST THE LADY IS OBDURATE TO HIS ENTREATIES BUT PHILOGENET
HAVING PROVED THE SINCERITY OF HIS PASSION BY A FAINTING FIT
ROSIAL RELENTS PROMISES HER FAVOUR AND ORDERS PHILOBONE TO
CONDUCT HIM ROUND THE COURT
THE COURTIERS ARE THEN MINUTELY
DESCRIBED BUT THE DESCRIPTION IS BROKEN OFF ABRUPTLY AND WE ARE
INTRODUCED TO ROSIAL IN THE MIDST OF A CONFESSION OF HER LOVE
FINALLY SHE COMMANDS PHILOGENET TO ABIDE WITH HER UNTIL THE
FIRST OF MAY WHEN THE KING OF LOVE WILL HOLD HIGH FESTIVAL HE
OBEYS AND THE POEM CLOSES WITH THE MAY DAY FESTIVAL SERVICE
CELEBRATED BY A CHOIR OF BIRDS WHO SING AN INGENIOUS BUT WHAT
MUST HAVE SEEMED IN THOSE DAYS A MORE THAN SLIGHTLY PROFANE
PARAPHRASE OR PARODY OF THE MATINS FOR TRINITY SUNDAY TO THE
PRAISE OF CUPID
FROM THIS OUTLINE IT WILL BE SEEN AT ONCE THAT
CHAUCER'S COURT OF LOVE IS IN IMPORTANT PARTICULARS DIFFERENT
FROM THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH IN THE TWO CENTURIES PRECEDING HIS
OWN HAD SO MUCH OCCUPIED THE ATTENTION OF POETS AND GALLANTS
AND SO POWERFULLY CONTROLLED THE SOCIAL LIFE OF THE NOBLE AND
REFINED CLASSES
IT IS A REGAL NOT A LEGAL COURT WHICH THE POET
PICTURES TO US WE ARE NOT INTRODUCED TO A REGULARLY CONSTITUTED
AND AUTHORITATIVE TRIBUNAL IN WHICH NICE QUESTIONS OF CONDUCT IN
THE RELATIONS OF LOVERS ARE DISCUSSED AND DECIDED BUT TO THE
CENTRAL AND SOVEREIGN SEAT OF LOVE'S AUTHORITY WHERE THE
STATUTES ARE MOULDED AND THE DECREES ARE ISSUED UPON WHICH
THE INFERIOR AND SPECIAL TRIBUNALS WE HAVE MENTIONED FRAME THEIR
PROCEEDINGS
THE COURTS OF LOVE IN CHAUCER'S TIME HAD LOST
NONE OF THE PRESTIGE AND INFLUENCE WHICH HAD BEEN CONFERRED
UPON THEM BY THE PATRONAGE AND PARTICIPATION OF KINGS QUEENS
EMPERORS AND POPES
BUT THE INSTITUTION IN ITS LEGAL OR JUDICIAL
CHARACTER WAS PECULIAR TO FRANCE AND ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE SPIRIT
OF CHAUCER'S POEM ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE ESTEEM AND
REVERENCE IN WHICH WOMEN WERE HELD IS THAT WHICH ANIMATED
THE FRENCH COURTS HIS TREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT IS BROADER AND
MORE GENERAL CONSEQUENTLY MORE FITTED TO ENLIST THE INTEREST OF
ENGLISH READERS
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE MODERN SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT CHAUCER WAS
NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS POEM
THE POEM CONSISTS OF 206 STANZAS OF SEVEN LINES EACH OF WHICH
IN THIS EDITION EIGHTY THREE ARE REPRESENTED BY A PROSE
ABRIDGEMENT
WITH TIMOROUS HEART AND TREMBLING HAND OF DREAD
OF CUNNING NAKED BARE OF ELOQUENCE SKILL
UNTO THE FLOW'R OF PORT IN WOMANHEAD ONE WHO IS THE PERFECTION
I WRITE AS HE THAT NONE INTELLIGENCE OF WOMANLY BEHAVIOUR
OF METRES HATH 1 NOR FLOWERS OF SENTENCE
SAVE THAT ME LIST MY WRITING TO CONVEY
IN THAT I CAN TO PLEASE HER HIGH NOBLEY NOBLENESS
THE BLOSSOMS FRESH OF TULLIUS' GARDEN SWOOT CICERO SWEET
PRESENT THEY NOT MY MATTER FOR TO BORN 2 BURNISH POLISH
POEMS OF VIRGIL TAKE HERE NO ROOT
NOR CRAFT OF GALFRID 3 MAY NOT HERE SOJOURN
WHY N'AM I CUNNING O WELL MAY I MOURN AM I NOT
FOR LACK OF SCIENCE THAT I CANNOT WRITE
UNTO THE PRINCESS OF MY LIFE ARIGHT
NO TERMS ARE DIGN UNTO HER EXCELLENCE WORTHY
SO IS SHE SPRUNG OF NOBLE STIRP AND HIGH STOCK 4
A WORLD OF HONOUR AND OF REVERENCE
THERE IS IN HER THIS WILL I TESTIFY
CALLIOPE 5 THOU SISTER WISE AND SLY SKILFUL
AND THOU MINERVA GUIDE ME WITH THY GRACE
THAT LANGUAGE RUDE MY MATTER NOT DEFACE
THY SUGAR DROPPES SWEET OF HELICON
DISTIL IN ME THOU GENTLE MUSE I PRAY
AND THEE MELPOMENE 6 I CALL ANON
OF IGNORANCE THE MIST TO CHASE AWAY
AND GIVE ME GRACE SO FOR TO WRITE AND SAY
THAT SHE MY LADY OF HER WORTHINESS
ACCEPT IN GREE THIS LITTLE SHORT TREATESS WITH FAVOUR TREATISE
THAT IS ENTITLED THUS THE COURT OF LOVE
AND YE THAT BE METRICIANS ME EXCUSE SKILLED VERSIFIERS
I YOU BESEECH FOR VENUS' SAKE ABOVE
FOR WHAT I MEAN IN THIS YE NEED NOT MUSE
AND IF SO BE MY LADY IT REFUSE
FOR LACK OF ORNATE SPEECH I WOULD BE WOE
THAT I PRESUME TO HER TO WRITE SO
BUT MY INTENT AND ALL MY BUSY CURE CARE
IS FOR TO WRITE THIS TREATISE AS I CAN
UNTO MY LADY STABLE TRUE AND SURE
FAITHFUL AND KIND SINCE FIRST THAT SHE BEGAN
ME TO ACCEPT IN SERVICE AS HER MAN
TO HER BE ALL THE PLEASURE OF THIS BOOK
THAT WHEN HER LIKE SHE MAY IT READ AND LOOK
IT PLEASES HER
WHEN HE WAS YOUNG AT EIGHTEEN YEAR OF AGE
LUSTY AND LIGHT DESIROUS OF PLEASANCE
APPROACHING FULL SAD AND RIPE CORAGE 7 GRADUALLY ATTAINING
THEN SAYS THE POET DID LOVE URGE HIM TO DO
HIM OBEISANCE AND TO GO THE COURT OF LOVE TO
SEE A LITE LITTLE BESIDE THE MOUNT OF CITHAREE
8 MERCURY BADE HIM ON PAIN OF DEATH TO
APPEAR AND HE WENT BY STRANGE AND FAR COUNTRIES
IN SEARCH OF THE COURT
SEEING AT LAST A CROWD OF
PEOPLE AS BEES MAKING THEIR WAY THITHER THE
POET ASKED WHITHER THEY WENT AND ONE THAT
ANSWER'D LIKE A MAID SAID THAT THEY WERE BOUND TO
THE COURT OF LOVE AT CITHERON WHERE THE KING
OF LOVE AND ALL HIS NOBLE ROUT COMPANY
DWELLETH WITHIN A CASTLE ROYALLY
SO THEM APACE I JOURNEY'D FORTH AMONG
AND AS HE SAID SO FOUND I THERE TRULY
FOR I BEHELD THE TOWN SO HIGH AND STRONG
AND HIGH PINNACLES LARGE OF HEIGHT AND LONG
WITH PLATE OF GOLD BESPREAD ON EV'RY SIDE
AND PRECIOUS STONES THE STONE WORK FOR TO HIDE
NO SAPPHIRE OF IND NO RUBY RICH OF PRICE
THERE LACKED THEN NOR EMERALD SO GREEN
BALAIS TURKEIS 9 NOR THING TO MY DEVISE IN MY JUDGEMENT
THAT MAY THE CASTLE MAKE FOR TO SHEEN BE BEAUTIFUL
ALL WAS AS BRIGHT AS STARS IN WINTER BE'N
AND PHOEBUS SHONE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AGAIN
FOR TRESPASS DONE TO HIGH ESTATES TWAIN OFFENCE
WHEN HE HAD FOUND VENUS IN THE ARMS OF MARS AND HASTENED TO
TELL VULCAN OF HIS WIFE'S INFIDELITY 10
NOW HE WAS SHINING
BRIGHTLY ON THE CASTLE IN SIGN HE LOOKED AFTER LOVE'S GRACE FOR
THERE IS NO GOD IN HEAVEN OR IN HELL BUT HE HATH BEEN RIGHT
SUBJECT UNTO LOVE CONTINUING HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE CASTLE
PHILOGENET SAYS THAT HE SAW NEVER ANY SO LARGE AND HIGH WITHIN
AND WITHOUT IT WAS PAINTED WITH MANY A THOUSAND DAISIES RED
AS ROSE AND WHITE ALSO IN SIGNIFICATION OF WHOM HE KNEW NOT
UNLESS IT WAS THE FLOWER OF ALCESTIS 11 WHO UNDER VENUS
WAS QUEEN OF THE PLACE AS ADMETUS WAS KING
TO WHOM OBEY'D THE LADIES GOOD NINETEEN 12
WITH MANY A THOUSAND OTHER BRIGHT OF FACE
AND YOUNG MEN FELE CAME FORTH WITH LUSTY PACE MANY 13
AND AGED EKE THEIR HOMAGE TO DISPOSE
BUT WHAT THEY WERE I COULD NOT WELL DISCLOSE
YET NERE AND NERE FORTH IN I GAN ME DRESS NEARER
INTO A HALL OF NOBLE APPARAIL FURNISHINGS
WITH ARRAS 14 SPREAD AND CLOTH OF GOLD I GUESS
AND OTHER SILK OF EASIER AVAIL LESS DIFFICULT COSTLY TO ATTAIN
UNDER THE CLOTH OF THEIR ESTATE SANS FAIL STATE CANOPY
THE KING AND QUEEN THERE SAT AS I BEHELD
IT PASSED JOY OF ELYSEE THE FELD THE ELYSIAN FIELDS
THERE SAINTES HAVE THEIR COMING AND RESORT MARTYRS FOR LOVE
TO SEE THE KING SO ROYALLY BESEEN ADORNED
IN PURPLE CLAD AND EKE THE QUEEN IN SORT SUITABLY
AND ON THEIR HEADES SAW I CROWNES TWAIN
WITH STONES FRETT SO THAT IT WAS NO PAIN ADORNED
WITHOUTE MEAT OR DRINK TO STAND AND SEE
THE KINGE'S HONOUR AND THE ROYALTY
TO TREAT OF STATE AFFAIRS DANGER 15 STOOD BY THE
KING AND DISDAIN BY THE QUEEN WHO CAST HER EYES
HAUGHTILY ABOUT SENDING FORTH BEAMS THAT SEEMED
SHAPEN LIKE A DART SHARP AND PIERCING AND SMALL AND
STRAIGHT OF LINE WHILE HER HAIR SHONE AS GOLD SO FINE
DISHEVEL CRISP DOWN HANGING AT HER BACK A YARD IN

THESE WORDES SAID SHE CAUGHT ME BY THE LAP EDGE OF THE GARMENT
AND LED ME FORTH INTO A TEMPLE ROUND
BOTH LARGE AND WIDE AND AS MY BLESSED HAP

ADVENTURE WAS RIGHT SOON I FOUND
A TABERNACLE 18 RAISED FROM THE GROUND
WHERE VENUS SAT AND CUPID BY HER SIDE
YET HALF FOR DREAD I GAN MY VISAGE HIDE

SEEING FULL SUNDRY PEOPLE IN THE PLACE PEOPLE OF MANY SORTS

OF MANY A PRINCE AND MANY A DOUGHTY KING
WHOSE MARTYRDOM WAS SHOW'D ABOUT THE WALLS
AND HOW THAT FELE FOR LOVE HAD SUFFER'D FALLS MANY CALAMITIES
PHILOGENET WAS ASTONISHED AT THE CROWD OF PEOPLE THAT

PHILOBONE INFORMED HIM THAT THEY CAME FROM OTHER
COURTS THOSE WHO KNELT IN BLUE WORE THE COLOUR IN
SIGN OF THEIR CHANGELESS TRUTH 21 THOSE IN BLACK

TREMBLING AND PALE PHILOGENET APPROACHED
THE THRONE OF ADMETUS AND WAS STERNLY ASKED WHY HE
CAME SO LATE TO COURT
HE PLEADED THAT A HUNDRED
TIMES HE HAD BEEN AT THE GATE BUT HAD BEEN PREVENTED
FROM ENTERING BY FAILURE TO SEE ANY OF HIS
ACQUAINTANCES AND BY SHAMEFACEDNESS
THE KING
PARDONED HIM ON CONDITION THAT THENCEFORTH HE SHOULD
SERVE LOVE AND THE POET TOOK OATH TO DO SO THOUGH
DEATH THEREFOR ME THIRLE PIERCE WITH HIS SPEAR
WHEN THE KING HAD SEEN ALL THE NEW COMERS HE

THIS STATUTE WAS OF OLD ANTIQUITY
THE OFFICER CALLED RIGOUR WHO IS INCORRUPTIBLE BY
PARTIALITY FAVOUR PRAYER OR GOLD MADE THEM SWEAR
TO KEEP THE STATUTES AND AFTER TAKING THE OATH
PHILOGENET TURNED OVER OTHER LEAVES OF THE BOOK
CONTAINING THE STATUTES OF WOMEN
BUT RIGOUR STERNLY
BADE HIM FORBEAR FOR NO MAN MIGHT KNOW THE STATUTES
THAT BELONG TO WOMEN
IN SECRET WISE THEY KEPTE BE FULL CLOSE
THEY SOUND EACH ONE TO LIBERTY MY FRIEND TEND ACCORD
PLEASANT THEY BE AND TO THEIR OWN PURPOSE
THERE WOT NO WIGHT OF THEM BUT GOD AND FIEND KNOWS
NOR AUGHT SHALL WIT UNTO THE WORLDE'S END
THE QUEEN HATH GIV'N ME CHARGE IN PAIN TO DIE
NEVER TO READ NOR SEE THEM WITH MINE EYE
FOR MEN SHALL NOT SO NEAR OF COUNSEL BE'N
WITH WOMANHEAD NOR KNOWEN OF THEIR GUISE
NOR WHAT THEY THINK NOR OF THEIR WIT TH'ENGINE CRAFT
I ME REPORT TO SOLOMON THE WISE 25 I REFER FOR PROOF TO
AND MIGHTY SAMSON WHICH BEGUILED THRICE
WITH DELILAH WAS HE WOT THAT IN A THROW
THERE MAY NO MAN STATUTE OF WOMEN KNOW
FOR IT PERADVENTURE MAY RIGHT SO BEFALL
THAT THEY BE BOUND BY NATURE TO DECEIVE
AND SPIN AND WEEP AND SUGAR STREW ON GALL 26
THE HEART OF MAN TO RAVISH AND TO REAVE
AND WHET THEIR TONGUE AS SHARP AS SWORD OR GLEVE GLAIVE SWORD
IT MAY BETIDE THIS IS THEIR ORDINANCE
SO MUST THEY LOWLY DO THEIR OBSERVANCE
AND KEEP THE STATUTE GIVEN THEM OF KIND BY NATURE
OF SUCH AS LOVE HATH GIV'N THEM IN THEIR LIFE
MEN MAY NOT WIT WHY TURNETH EVERY WIND
NOR WAXE WISE NOR BE INQUISITIFE
TO KNOW SECRET OF MAID WIDOW OR WIFE
FOR THEY THEIR STATUTES HAVE TO THEM RESERVED
AND NEVER MAN TO KNOW THEM HATH DESERVED
RIGOUR THEN SENT THEM FORTH TO PAY COURT TO VENUS
AND PRAY HER TO TEACH THEM HOW THEY MIGHT SERVE AND
PLEASE THEIR DAMES OR TO PROVIDE WITH LADIES THOSE
WHOSE HEARTS WERE YET VACANT
BEFORE VENUS KNELT A
THOUSAND SAD PETITIONERS ENTREATING HER TO PUNISH THE
FALSE UNTRUE THAT HAD BROKEN THEIR VOWS BARREN OF
RUTH UNTRUE OF WHAT THEY SAID NOW THAT THEIR LUST AND
PLEASURE IS ALLAY'D BUT THE MOURNERS WERE IN A
MINORITY
YET EFT AGAIN A THOUSAND MILLION
REJOICING LOVE LEADING THEIR LIFE IN BLISS
THEY SAID VENUS REDRESS OF ALL DIVISION HEALER
GODDESS ETERNAL THY NAME HERIED IS GLORIFIED
BY LOVE'S BOND IS KNIT ALL THING Y WIS ASSUREDLY
BEAST UNTO BEAST THE EARTH TO WATER WAN PALE
BIRD UNTO BIRD AND WOMAN UNTO MAN 27
THIS IS THE LIFE OF JOY THAT WE BE IN
RESEMBLING LIFE OF HEAV'NLY PARADISE
LOVE IS EXILER AY OF VICE AND SIN
LOVE MAKETH HEARTES LUSTY TO DEVISE
HONOUR AND GRACE HAVE THEY IN EV'RY WISE
THAT BE TO LOVE'S LAW OBEDIENT
LOVE MAKETH FOLK BENIGN AND DILIGENT
AYE STIRRING THEM TO DREADE VICE AND SHAME
IN THEIR DEGREE IT MAKES THEM HONOURABLE
AND SWEET IT IS OF LOVE TO BEAR THE NAME
SO THAT HIS LOVE BE FAITHFUL TRUE AND STABLE
LOVE PRUNETH HIM TO SEEMEN AMIABLE
LOVE HATH NO FAULT WHERE IT IS EXERCIS'D
BUT SOLE WITH THEM THAT HAVE ALL LOVE DESPIS'D ONLY
AND THEY CONCLUDE WITH GRATEFUL HONOURS TO THE GODDESS
REJOICING HAT THEY ARE HERS IN HEART AND ALL INFLAMED
WITH HER GRACE AND HEAVENLY FEAR
PHILOGENET NOW
ENTREATS THE GODDESS TO REMOVE HIS GRIEF FOR HE ALSO
LOVES AND HOTLY ONLY HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE
SAVE ONLY THIS BY GOD AND BY MY TROTH
TROUBLED I WAS WITH SLUMBER SLEEP AND SLOTH
THIS OTHER NIGHT AND IN A VISION
I SAW A WOMAN ROAMEN UP AND DOWN
OF MEAN STATURE AND SEEMLY TO BEHOLD MIDDLING HEIGHT
LUSTY AND FRESH DEMURE OF COUNTENANCE
YOUNG AND WELL SHAP'D WITH HAIRE SHEEN AS GOLD SHINING
WITH EYNE AS CRYSTAL FARCED WITH PLEASANCE CRAMMED
AND SHE GAN STIR MINE HEART A LITE TO DANCE LITTLE
BUT SUDDENLY SHE VANISH GAN RIGHT THERE
THUS I MAY SAY I LOVE AND WOT NOT WHERE KNOW
IF HE COULD ONLY KNOW THIS LADY HE WOULD SERVE AND OBEY HER
WITH ALL BENIGNITY BUT IF HIS DESTINY WERE OTHERWISE HE WOULD
GLADLY LOVE AND SERVE HIS LADY WHOSOEVER SHE MIGHT BE
HE
CALLED ON VENUS FOR HELP TO POSSESS HIS QUEEN AND HEART'S LIFE
AND VOWED DAILY WAR WITH DIANA THAT GODDESS CHASTE I KEEPEN
CARE IN NO WISE TO SERVE A FIG FOR ALL HER CHASTITY THEN HE
ROSE AND WENT HIS WAY PASSING BY A RICH AND BEAUTIFUL SHRINE
WHICH PHILOBONE INFORMED HIM WAS THE SEPULCHRE OF PITY
A
TENDER CREATURE SHE SAID
IS SHRINED THERE AND PITY IS HER NAME
SHE SAW AN EAGLE WREAK HIM ON A FLY AVENGE
AND PLUCK HIS WING AND EKE HIM IN HIS GAME FOR SPORT
AND TENDER HEART OF THAT HATH MADE HER DIE
EKE SHE WOULD WEEP AND MOURN RIGHT PITEOUSLY
TO SEE A LOVER SUFFER GREAT DISTRESS
IN ALL THE COURT WAS NONE AS I DO GUESS
THAT COULD A LOVER HALF SO WELL AVAIL HELP
NOR OF HIS WOE THE TORMENT OR THE RAGE
ASLAKE FOR HE WAS SURE WITHOUTE FAIL ASSUAGE
THAT OF HIS GRIEF SHE COULD THE HEAT ASSUAGE
INSTEAD OF PITY SPEEDETH HOT COURAGE
THE MATTERS ALL OF COURT NOW SHE IS DEAD
I ME REPORT IN THIS TO WOMANHEAD FOR EVIDENCE I REFER TO THE
BEHAVIOUR OF WOMEN THEMSELVES
FOR WAIL AND WEEP AND CRY AND SPEAK AND PRAY
WOMEN WOULD NOT HAVE PITY ON THY PLAINT
NOR BY THAT MEANS TO EASE THINE HEART CONVEY
BUT THEE RECEIVE FOR THEIR OWN TALENT INCLINATION
AND SAY THAT PITY CAUS'D THEE IN CONSENT
OF RUTH TO TAKE THY SERVICE AND THY PAIN COMPASSION
IN THAT THOU MAY'ST TO PLEASE THY SOVEREIGN
PHILOBONE NOW PROMISED TO LEAD PHILOGENET TO THE FAIREST LADY
UNDER SUN THAT IS THE MIRROR OF JOY AND BLISS WHOSE NAME IS
ROSIAL AND WHOSE HEART AS YET IS GIVEN TO NO WIGHT
SUGGESTING THAT AS HE ALSO WAS WITH LOVE BUT LIGHT ADVANC'D
HE MIGHT SET THIS LADY IN THE PLACE OF HER OF WHOM HE HAD
DREAMED
ENTERING A CHAMBER GAY THERE WAS ROSIAL WOMANLY
TO SEE AND THE SUBTLE PIERCING BEAMS OF HER EYES WOUNDED
PHILOGENET TO THE HEART
WHEN HE COULD SPEAK HE THREW HIMSELF
ON HIS KNEES BESEECHING HER TO COOL HIS FERVENT WOE
FOR THERE I TOOK FULL PURPOSE IN MY MIND
UNTO HER GRACE MY PAINFUL HEART TO BIND
FOR IF I SHALL ALL FULLY HER DESCRIVE DESCRIBE
HER HEAD WAS ROUND BY COMPASS OF NATURE
HER HAIR AS GOLD SHE PASSED ALL ALIVE
AND LILY FOREHEAD HAD THIS CREATURE
WITH LIVELY BROWES FLAW OF COLOUR PURE YELLOW EYEBROWS 28
BETWEEN THE WHICH WAS MEAN DISSEVERANCE
FROM EV'RY BROW TO SHOW A DUE DISTANCE
HER NOSE DIRECTED STRAIGHT EVEN AS LINE
WITH FORM AND SHAPE THERETO CONVENIENT
IN WHICH THE GODDES' MILK WHITE PATH DOTH SHINE THE GALAXY
AND EKE HER EYNE BE BRIGHT AND ORIENT
AS IS THE SMARAGD UNTO MY JUDGMENT EMERALD
OR YET THESE STARRES HEAV'NLY SMALL AND BRIGHT
HER VISAGE IS OF LOVELY RED AND WHITE
HER MOUTH IS SHORT AND SHUT IN LITTLE SPACE
FLAMING SOMEDEAL NOT OVER RED I MEAN SOMEWHAT
WITH PREGNANT LIPS AND THICK TO KISS PERCASE AS IT CHANCED
FOR LIPPES THIN NOT FAT BUT EVER LEAN
THEY SERVE OF NAUGHT THEY BE NOT WORTH A BEAN
FOR IF THE BASS BE FULL THERE IS DELIGHT KISS 29
MAXIMIAN 30 TRULY THUS DOTH HE WRITE
BUT TO MY PURPOSE I SAY WHITE AS SNOW
BE ALL HER TEETH AND IN ORDER THEY STAND
OF ONE STATURE AND EKE HER BREATH I TROW
SURMOUNTETH ALL ODOURS THAT E'ER I FAND FOUND
IN SWEETNESS AND HER BODY FACE AND HAND
BE SHARPLY SLENDER SO THAT FROM THE HEAD
UNTO THE FOOT ALL IS BUT WOMANHEAD WOMANLY PERFECTION
I HOLD MY PEACE OF OTHER THINGES HID
HERE SHALL MY SOUL AND NOT MY TONGUE BEWRAY
BUT HOW SHE WAS ARRAY'D IF YE ME BID
THAT SHALL I WELL DISCOVER YOU AND SAY
A BEND OF GOLD AND SILK FULL FRESH AND GAY BAND
WITH HAIR IN TRESS Y BROIDERED FULL WELL PLAITED IN TRESSES
RIGHT SMOOTHLY KEMPT AND SHINING EVERY DEAL
COMBED
ABOUT HER NECK A FLOW'R OF FRESH DEVICE
WITH RUBIES SET THAT LUSTY WERE TO SEE'N
AND SHE IN GOWN WAS LIGHT AND SUMMER WISE
SHAPEN FULL WELL THE COLOUR WAS OF GREEN
WITH AUREATE SEINT ABOUT HER SIDES CLEAN GOLDEN CINCTURE
WITH DIVERS STONES PRECIOUS AND RICH
THUS WAS SHE RAY'D YET SAW I NE'ER HER LICH ARRAYED LIKE
IF JOVE HAD BUT SEEN THIS LADY CALISTO AND ALCMENA HAD NEVER
LAIN IN HIS ARMS NOR HAD HE LOVED THE FAIR EUROPA NOR DANAE
NOR ANTIOPE FOR ALL THEIR BEAUTY STOOD IN ROSIAL SHE SEEMED
LIKE A THING CELESTIAL BY AND BY PHILOGENET PRESENTED TO HER HIS
PETITION FOR LOVE WHICH SHE HEARD WITH SOME HAUGHTINESS SHE
WAS NOT SHE SAID WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIM SHE DID NOT KNOW
WHERE HE DWELT NOR HIS NAME AND CONDITION
HE INFORMED HER
THAT IN ART OF LOVE HE WRITES AND MAKES SONGS THAT MAY BE
SUNG IN HONOUR OF THE KING AND QUEEN OF LOVE
AS FOR HIS NAME
MY NAME ALAS MY HEART WHY MAK'ST THOU STRANGE WHY SO COLD
PHILOGENET I CALL'D AM FAR AND NEAR OR DISTANT
OF CAMBRIDGE CLERK THAT NEVER THINK TO CHANGE
FROM YOU THAT WITH YOUR HEAV'NLY STREAMES CLEAR BEAMS GLANCES
RAVISH MY HEART AND GHOST AND ALL IN FERE ALL TOGETHER
SINCE AT THE FIRST I WRIT MY BILL FOR GRACE PETITION
ME THINKS I SEE SOME MERCY IN YOUR FACE
AND AGAIN HE HUMBLY PRESSED HIS SUIT
BUT THE LADY DISDAINED THE
IDEA THAT FOR A WORD OF SUGAR'D ELOQUENCE SHE SHOULD HAVE
COMPASSION IN SO LITTLE SPACE THERE COME BUT FEW WHO SPEEDE
HERE SO SOON IF AS HE SAYS THE BEAMS OF HER EYES PIERCE AND
FRET HIM THEN LET HIM WITHDRAW FROM HER PRESENCE
HURT NOT YOURSELF THROUGH FOLLY WITH A LOOK
I WOULD BE SORRY SO TO MAKE YOU SICK
A WOMAN SHOULD BEWARE EKE WHOM SHE TOOK
YE BE A CLERK GO SEARCHE WELL MY BOOK
IF ANY WOMEN BE SO LIGHT TO WIN EASY
NAY BIDE A WHILE THOUGH YE WERE ALL MY KIN MY ONLY KINDRED
HE MIGHT SUE AND SERVE AND WAX PALE AND GREEN AND DEAD
WITHOUT MURMURING IN ANY WISE BUT WHEREAS HE DESIRED HER
HASTILY TO LEAN TO LOVE HE WAS UNWISE AND MUST CEASE THAT
LANGUAGE
FOR SOME HAD BEEN AT COURT FOR TWENTY YEARS AND
MIGHT NOT OBTAIN THEIR MISTRESSES' FAVOUR THEREFORE SHE
MARVELLED THAT HE WAS SO BOLD AS TO TREAT OF LOVE WITH HER
PHILOGENET ON THIS BROKE INTO PITIFUL LAMENTATION BEWAILING THE
HOUR IN WHICH HE WAS BORN AND ASSURING THE UNYIELDING LADY THAT
THE FROSTY GRAVE AND COLD MUST BE HIS BED UNLESS SHE RELENTED
WITH THAT I FELL IN SWOON AND DEAD AS STONE
WITH COLOUR SLAIN AND WAN AS ASHES PALE DEATHLIKE
AND BY THE HAND SHE CAUGHT ME UP ANON
ARISE QUOTH SHE WHAT HAVE YE DRUNKEN DWALE SLEEPING POTION 31
WHY SLEEPE YE IT IS NO NIGHTERTALE NIGHT TIME

WHAT THING QUOTH SHE HATH MADE YOU SO DISMAY'D
SHE SAID THAT BY HIS HUE SHE KNEW WELL THAT HE WAS A LOVER AND
IF HE WERE SECRET COURTEOUS AND KIND HE MIGHT KNOW HOW ALL
THIS COULD BE ALLAYED
SHE WOULD AMEND ALL THAT SHE HAD MISSAID
AND SET HIS HEART AT EASE BUT HE MUST FAITHFULLY KEEP THE STATUTES
AND BREAK THEM NOT FOR SLOTH NOR IGNORANCE THE LOVER
REQUESTS HOWEVER THAT THE SIXTEENTH MAY BE RELEASED OR
MODIFIED FOR IT DOTH HIM GREAT GRIEVANCE AND SHE COMPLIES
AND SOFTLY THEN HER COLOUR GAN APPEAR
AS ROSE SO RED THROUGHOUT HER VISAGE ALL
WHEREFORE METHINKS IT IS ACCORDING HER APPROPRIATE TO
THAT SHE OF RIGHT BE CALLED ROSIAL
THUS HAVE I WON WITH WORDES GREAT AND SMALL
SOME GOODLY WORD OF HER THAT I LOVE BEST
AND TRUST SHE SHALL YET SET MINE HEART IN REST
ROSIAL NOW TOLD PHILOBONE TO CONDUCT PHILOGENET ALL OVER THE
COURT AND SHOW HIM WHAT LOVERS AND WHAT OFFICERS DWELT THERE
FOR HE WAS YET A STRANGER
AND STALKING SOFT WITH EASY PACE I SAW
ABOUT THE KING STANDEN ALL ENVIRON AROUND 32
ATTENDANCE DILIGENCE AND THEIR FELLAW
FURTHERER ESPERANCE AND MANY ONE HOPE
DREAD TO OFFEND THERE STOOD AND NOT ALONE
FOR THERE WAS EKE THE CRUEL ADVERSAIR
THE LOVER'S FOE THAT CALLED IS DESPAIR
WHICH UNTO ME SPAKE ANGRILY AND FELL CRUELLY
AND SAID MY LADY ME DECEIVE SHALL
TROW'ST THOU QUOTH SHE THAT ALL THAT SHE DID TELL
IS TRUE NAY NAY BUT UNDER HONEY GALL
THY BIRTH AND HERS THEY BE NO THING EGAL EQUAL
CAST OFF THINE HEART 33 FOR ALL HER WORDES WHITE
FOR IN GOOD FAITH SHE LOVES THEE BUT A LITE LITTLE

BUT WELL WOT I MY LADY GRANTED ME
TRULY TO BE MY WOUNDE'S REMEDY
HER GENTLENESS MAY NOT INFECTED BE NOBLE NATURE
WITH DOUBLENESS THIS TRUST I TILL I DIE DUPLICITY
SO CAST I T' AVOID DESPAIR'S COMPANY
AND TAKE HOPE TO COUNSEL AND TO FRIEND
YEA KEEP THAT WELL QUOTH PHILOBONE IN MIND
AND THERE BESIDE WITHIN A BAY WINDOW
STOOD ONE IN GREEN FULL LARGE OF BREADTH AND LENGTH
HIS BEARD AS BLACK AS FEATHERS OF THE CROW
HIS NAME WAS LUST OF WONDROUS MIGHT AND STRENGTH
AND WITH DELIGHT TO ARGUE THERE HE THINK'TH
FOR THIS WAS ALWAY HIS OPINION
THAT LOVE WAS SIN AND SO HE HATH BEGUN
TO REASON FAST AND LEDGE AUTHORITY ALLEGE AUTHORITIES
NAY QUOTH DELIGHT LOVE IS A VIRTUE CLEAR
AND FROM THE SOUL HIS PROGRESS HOLDETH HE
BLIND APPETITE OF LUST DOTH OFTEN STEER STIR THE HEART
AND THAT IS SIN FOR REASON LACKETH THERE
FOR THOU DOST THINK THY NEIGHBOUR'S WIFE TO WIN
YET THINK IT WELL THAT LOVE MAY NOT BE SIN
FOR GOD AND SAINT THEY LOVE RIGHT VERILY
VOID OF ALL SIN AND VICE THIS KNOW I WEEL WELL
AFFECTION OF FLESH IS SIN TRULY
BUT VERY LOVE IS VIRTUE AS I FEEL TRUE
FOR VERY LOVE MAY FRAIL DESIRE AKELE COOL
FOR VERY LOVE IS LOVE WITHOUTE SIN
NOW STINT QUOTH LUST THOU SPEAK'ST NOT WORTH A PIN CEASE
AND THERE I LEFT THEM IN THEIR ARGUING
ROAMING FARTHER INTO THE CASTLE WIDE
AND IN A CORNER LIAR STOOD TALKING
OF LEASINGS FAST WITH FLATTERY THERE BESIDE FALSEHOODS
HE SAID THAT WOMEN WARE ATTIRE OF PRIDE WORE

NEED I NOT HAVE MY HEART FOR JOY DOTH BEAT

O WHY BE SOME SO SORRY AND SO SAD
COMPLAINING THUS IN BLACK AND WHITE AND GRAY
FRIARS THEY BE AND MONKES IN GOOD FAY
ALAS FOR RUTH GREAT DOLE IT IS TO SEE SORROW
TO SEE THEM THUS BEWAIL AND SORRY BE
SEE HOW THEY CRY AND RING THEIR HANDES WHITE
FOR THEY SO SOON WENT TO RELIGION YOUNG
AND EKE THE NUNS WITH VEIL AND WIMPLE PLIGHT PLAITED
THEIR THOUGHT IS THEY BE IN CONFUSION
ALAS THEY SAY WE FEIGN PERFECTION 35
IN CLOTHES WIDE AND LACK OUR LIBERTY
BUT ALL THE SIN MUST ON OUR FRIENDES BE
36
FOR VENUS WOT WE WOULD AS FAIN AS YE GLADLY
THAT BE ATTIRED HERE AND WELL BESEEN GAILY CLOTHED
DESIRE MAN AND LOVE IN OUR DEGREE
FIRM AND FAITHFUL RIGHT AS WOULD THE QUEEN
OUR FRIENDES WICK' IN TENDER YOUTH AND GREEN
AGAINST OUR WILL MADE US RELIGIOUS
THAT IS THE CAUSE WE MOURN AND WAILE THUS
THEN SAID THE MONKS AND FRIARS IN THE TIDE AT THE SAME TIME
WELL MAY WE CURSE OUR ABBEYS AND OUR PLACE
OUR STATUTES SHARP TO SING IN COPES WIDE 37
CHASTELY TO KEEP US OUT OF LOVE'S GRACE
AND NEVER TO FEEL COMFORT NOR SOLACE DELIGHT
YET SUFFER WE THE HEAT OF LOVE'S FIRE
AND AFTER SOME OTHER HAPLY WE DESIRE
O FORTUNE CURSED WHY NOW AND WHEREFORE
HAST THOU THEY SAID BEREFT US LIBERTY
SINCE NATURE GAVE US INSTRUMENT IN STORE
AND APPETITE TO LOVE AND LOVERS BE
WHY MUST WE SUFFER SUCH ADVERSITY
DIAN' TO SERVE AND VENUS TO REFUSE
FULL OFTEN SITHE THESE MATTERS DO US MUSE
MANY A TIME
WE SERVE AND HONOUR SORE AGAINST OUR WILL
OF CHASTITY THE GODDESS AND THE QUEEN
US LIEFER WERE WITH VENUS BIDE STILL WE WOULD RATHER
AND HAVE REGARD FOR LOVE AND SUBJECT BE'N
UNTO THESE WOMEN COURTLY FRESH AND SHEEN BRIGHT BEAUTIFUL
FORTUNE WE CURSE THY WHEEL OF VARIANCE
WHERE WE WERE WELL THOU REAVEST OUR PLEASANCE TAKEST AWAY
THUS LEAVE I THEM WITH VOICE OF PLAINT AND CARE
IN RAGING WOE CRYING FULL PITEOUSLY
AND AS I WENT FULL NAKED AND FULL BARE
SOME I BEHELD LOOKING DISPITEOUSLY
ON POVERTY THAT DEADLY CAST THEIR EYE
AND WELL AWAY THEY CRIED AND WERE NOT FAIN
FOR THEY MIGHT NOT THEIR GLAD DESIRE ATTAIN
FOR LACK OF RICHES WORLDLY AND OF GOOD
THEY BAN AND CURSE AND WEEP AND SAY ALAS
THAT POVERT' HATH US HENT THAT WHILOM STOOD SEIZED
AT HEARTE'S EASE AND FREE AND IN GOOD CASE
BUT NOW WE DARE NOT SHOW OURSELVES IN PLACE
NOR US EMBOLD TO DWELL IN COMPANY MAKE BOLD VENTURE
WHERE AS OUR HEART WOULD LOVE RIGHT FAITHFULLY
AND YET AGAINWARD SHRIEKED EV'RY NUN
THE PANG OF LOVE SO STRAINED THEM TO CRY
NOW WOE THE TIME QUOTH THEY THAT WE BE BOUN' BOUND
THIS HATEFUL ORDER NICE WILL DO US DIE INTO WHICH WE FOOLISHLY
WE SIGH AND SOB AND BLEEDEN INWARDLY ENTERED
FRETTING OURSELVES WITH THOUGHT AND HARD COMPLAINT
THAT NIGH FOR LOVE WE WAXE WOOD AND FAINT MAD
AND AS I STOOD BEHOLDING HERE AND THERE
I WAS WARE OF A SORT FULL LANGUISHING A CLASS OF PEOPLE
SAVAGE AND WILD OF LOOKING AND OF CHEER
THEIR MANTLES AND THEIR CLOTHES AYE TEARING
AND OFT THEY WERE OF NATURE COMPLAINING
FOR THEY THEIR MEMBERS LACKED FOOT AND HAND
WITH VISAGE WRY AND BLIND I UNDERSTAND
THEY LACKED SHAPE AND BEAUTY TO PREFER
THEMSELVES IN LOVE AND SAID THAT GOD AND KIND NATURE
HAD FORGED THEM TO WORSHIPPE THE STERRE FASHIONED STAR
VENUS THE BRIGHT AND LEFTEN ALL BEHIND
HIS OTHER WORKES CLEAN AND OUT OF MIND
FOR OTHER HAVE THEIR FULL SHAPE AND BEAUTY
AND WE QUOTH THEY BE IN DEFORMITY
AND NIGH TO THEM THERE WAS A COMPANY
THAT HAVE THE SISTERS WARRAY'D AND MISSAID
I MEAN THE THREE OF FATAL DESTINY 38
THAT BE OUR WORKERS SUDDENLY ABRAID AROUSED
OUT GAN THEY CRY AS THEY HAD BEEN AFRAID
WE CURSE QUOTH THEY THAT EVER HATH NATURE
Y FORMED US THIS WOEFUL LIFE T'ENDURE
AND THERE EKE WAS CONTRITE AND GAN REPENT
CONFESSING WHOLE THE WOUND THAT CYTHERE 39
HAD WITH THE DART OF HOT DESIRE HIM SENT
AND HOW THAT HE TO LOVE MUST SUBJECT BE
THEN HELD HE ALL HIS SCORNES VANITY
AND SAID THAT LOVERS HELD A BLISSFUL LIFE
YOUNG MEN AND OLD AND WIDOW MAID AND WIFE
BEREAVE ME GODDESS QUOTH HE OF THY MIGHT
MY SCORNES ALL AND SCOFFES THAT I HAVE
NO POWER FOR TO MOCKEN ANY WIGHT
THAT IN THY SERVICE DWELL FOR I DID RAVE
THIS KNOW I WELL RIGHT NOW SO GOD ME SAVE
AND I SHALL BE THE CHIEF POST OF THY FAITH PROP PILLAR
AND LOVE UPHOLD THE REVERSE WHOSO SAITH
DISSEMBLE STOOD NOT FAR FROM HIM IN TRUTH
WITH PARTY MANTLE PARTY HOOD AND HOSE PARTI COLOURED
AND SAID HE HAD UPON HIS LADY RUTH PITY
AND THUS HE WOUND HIM IN AND GAN TO GLOSE
OF HIS INTENT FULL DOUBLE I SUPPOSE
IN ALL THE WORLD HE SAID HE LOV'D HER WEEL
BUT AY ME THOUGHT HE LOV'D HER NE'ER A DEAL NEVER A JOT
EKE SHAMEFASTNESS WAS THERE AS I TOOK HEED
THAT BLUSHED RED AND DURST NOT BE Y KNOW
SHE LOVER WAS FOR THEREOF HAD SHE DREAD
SHE STOOD AND HUNG HER VISAGE DOWN ALOW
BUT SUCH A SIGHT IT WAS TO SEE I TROW
AS OF THESE ROSES RUDDY ON THEIR STALK
THERE COULD NO WIGHT HER SPY TO SPEAK OR TALK
IN LOVE'S ART SO GAN SHE TO ABASH
NOR DURST NOT UTTER ALL HER PRIVITY
MANY A STRIPE AND MANY A GRIEVOUS LASH
SHE GAVE TO THEM THAT WOULDE LOVERS BE
AND HINDER'D SORE THE SIMPLE COMMONALTY
THAT IN NO WISE DURST GRACE AND MERCY CRAVE
FOR WERE NOT SHE THEY NEED BUT ASK AND HAVE BUT FOR HER
WHERE IF THEY NOW APPROACHE FOR TO SPEAK
THEN SHAMEFASTNESS RETURNETH THEM AGAIN TURNS THEM BACK
THEY THINK IF WE OUR SECRET COUNSEL BREAK
OUR LADIES WILL HAVE SCORN US CERTAIN
AND PERADVENTURE THINKE GREAT DISDAIN
THUS SHAMEFASTNESS MAY BRINGEN IN DESPAIR
WHEN SHE IS DEAD THE OTHER WILL BE HEIR
COME FORTH AVAUNTER NOW I RING THY BELL 40
I SPIED HIM SOON TO GOD I MAKE AVOW CONFESSION
HE LOOKED BLACK AS FIENDES DO IN HELL
THE FIRST QUOTH HE THAT EVER I DID WOW WOO
WITHIN A WORD SHE CAME I WOT NOT HOW SHE WAS WON WITH
SO THAT IN ARMES WAS MY LADY FREE A SINGLE WORD
AND SO HAVE BEEN A THOUSAND MORE THAN SHE
IN ENGLAND BRITAIN SPAIN AND PICARDY BRITTANY
ARTOIS AND FRANCE AND UP IN HIGH HOLLAND
IN BURGOYNE NAPLES AND IN ITALY BURGUNDY
NAVARRE AND GREECE AND UP IN HEATHEN LAND
WAS NEVER WOMAN YET THAT WOULD WITHSTAND
TO BE AT MY COMMANDMENT WHEN I WO'LD
I LACKED NEITHER SILVER COIN NOR GOLD
AND THERE I MET WITH THIS ESTATE AND THAT
AND HER I BROACH'D AND HER AND HER I TROW
LO THERE GOES ONE OF MINE AND WOT YE WHAT
YON FRESH ATTIRED HAVE I LAID FULL LOW
AND SUCH ONE YONDER EKE RIGHT WELL I KNOW
I KEPT THE STATUTE 41 WHEN WE LAY Y FERE TOGETHER
AND YET YON SAME HATH MADE ME RIGHT GOOD CHEER ALSO
THUS HATH AVAUNTER BLOWEN EV'RYWHERE
ALL THAT HE KNOWS AND MORE A THOUSAND FOLD
HIS ANCESTRY OF KIN WAS TO LIER LIAR
FOR FIRST HE MAKETH PROMISE FOR TO HOLD
HIS LADY'S COUNSEL AND IT NOT UNFOLD
WHEREFORE THE SECRET WHEN HE DOTH UNSHIT DISCLOSE
THEN LIETH HE THAT ALL THE WORLD MAY WIT KNOW
FOR FALSING SO HIS PROMISE AND BEHEST TRUST
I WONDER SORE HE HATH SUCH FANTASY
HE LACKETH WIT I TROW OR IS A BEAST
THAT CAN NO BET HIMSELF WITH REASON GUY BETTER GUIDE
BY MINE ADVICE LOVE SHALL BE CONTRARY
TO HIS AVAIL AND HIM EKE DISHONOUR ADVANTAGE
SO THAT IN COURT HE SHALL NO MORE SOJOUR SOJOURN REMAIN
TAKE HEED QUOTH SHE THIS LITTLE PHILOBONE
WHERE ENVY ROCKETH IN THE CORNER YOND YONDER
AND SITTETH DARK AND YE SHALL SEE ANON
HIS LEAN BODY FADING BOTH FACE AND HAND
HIMSELF HE FRETTETH AS I UNDERSTAND DEVOURETH
WITNESS OF OVID METAMORPHOSEOS 42
THE LOVER'S FOE HE IS I WILL NOT GLOSE GLOSS OVER
FOR WHERE A LOVER THINKETH HIM PROMOTE TO PROMOTE HIMSELF
ENVY WILL GRUDGE REPINING AT HIS WEAL
IT SWELLETH SORE ABOUT HIS HEARTE'S ROOT
THAT IN NO WISE HE CANNOT LIVE IN HEAL HEALTH
AND IF THE FAITHFUL TO HIS LADY STEAL
ENVY WILL NOISE AND RING IT ROUND ABOUT
AND SAY MUCH WORSE THAN DONE IS OUT OF DOUBT
AND PRIVY THOUGHT REJOICING OF HIMSELF
STOOD NOT FAR THENCE IN HABIT MARVELLOUS
YON IS THOUGHT I SOME SPIRIT OR SOME ELF
HIS SUBTILE IMAGE IS SO CURIOUS
HOW IS QUOTH I THAT HE IS SHADED THUS
WITH YONDER CLOTH I N'OT OF WHAT COLOR KNOW NOT
AND NEAR I WENT AND GAN TO LEAR AND PORE TO ASCERTAIN AND
GAZE CURIOUSLY
AND FRAINED HIM A QUESTION FULL HARD
ASKED
WHAT IS QUOTH I THE THING THOU LOVEST BEST
OR WHAT IS BOOT UNTO THY PAINES HARD REMEDY
ME THINKS THOU LIVEST HERE IN GREAT UNREST
THOU WAND'REST AYE FROM SOUTH TO EAST AND WEST
AND EAST TO NORTH AS FAR AS I CAN SEE
THERE IS NO PLACE IN COURT MAY HOLDE THEE
WHOM FOLLOWEST THOU WHERE IS THY HEART Y SET
BUT MY DEMAND ASSOIL I THEE REQUIRE ANSWER MY QUESTION
ME THOUGHT QUOTH HE NO CREATURE MAY LET HINDER
ME TO BE HERE AND WHERE AS I DESIRE
FOR WHERE AS ABSENCE HATH OUT THE FIRE
MY MERRY THOUGHT IT KINDLETH YET AGAIN
THAT BODILY ME THINKS WITH MY SOV'REIGN MY LADY
I STAND AND SPEAK AND LAUGH AND KISS AND HALSE EMBRACE
SO THAT MY THOUGHT COMFORTETH ME FULL OFT
I THINK GOD WOT THOUGH ALL THE WORLD BE FALSE
I WILL BE TRUE I THINK ALSO HOW SOFT
MY LADY IS IN SPEECH AND THIS ON LOFT
BRINGETH MY HEART WITH JOY AND GREAT GLADNESS
THIS PRIVY THOUGHT ALLAYS MY HEAVINESS
AND WHAT I THINK OR WHERE TO BE NO MAN
IN ALL THIS EARTH CAN TELL Y WIS BUT I
AND EKE THERE IS NO SWALLOW SWIFT NOR SWAN
SO WIGHT OF WING NOR HALF SO YERN CAN FLY NIMBLE EAGERLY
FOR I CAN BE AND THAT RIGHT SUDDENLY
IN HEAV'N IN HELL IN PARADISE AND HERE
AND WITH MY LADY WHEN I WILL DESIRE
I AM OF COUNSEL FAR AND WIDE I WOT
WITH LORD AND LADY AND THEIR PRIVITY
I WOT IT ALL BUT BE IT COLD OR HOT
THEY SHALL NOT SPEAK WITHOUT LICENCE OF ME
I MEAN IN SUCH AS SEASONABLE BE PRUDENT
THO FIRST THE THING IS THOUGHT WITHIN THE HEART WHEN
ERE ANY WORD OUT FROM THE MOUTH ASTART ESCAPE
AND WITH THE WORD THOUGHT BADE FAREWELL AND YEDE WENT AWAY
EKE FORTH WENT I TO SEE THE COURTE'S GUISE
AND AT THE DOOR CAME IN SO GOD ME SPEED
TWO COURTIERS OF AGE AND OF ASSISE SIZE
LIKE HIGH AND BROAD AND AS I ME ADVISE
THE GOLDEN LOVE AND LEADEN LOVE 43 THEY HIGHT WERE CALLED
THE ONE WAS SAD THE OTHER GLAD AND LIGHT
AT THIS POINT THERE IS A HIATUS IN THE POEM WHICH ABRUPTLY CEASES
TO NARRATE THE TOUR OF PHILOGENET AND PHILOBONE ROUND THE
COURT AND INTRODUCES US AGAIN TO ROSIAL WHO IS SPEAKING THUS
TO HER LOVER APPARENTLY IN CONTINUATION OF A CONFESSION OF LOVE
YES DRAW YOUR HEART WITH ALL YOUR FORCE AND MIGHT
TO LUSTINESS AND BE AS YE HAVE SAID
SHE ADMITS THAT SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM NO DROP OF FAVOUR
BUT THAT SHE SAW HIM WAX SO DEAD OF COUNTENANCE THEN PITY
OUT OF HER SHRINE AROSE FROM DEATH TO LIFE WHISPERINGLY
ENTREATING THAT SHE WOULD DO HIM SOME PLEASANCE
PHILOGENET
PROTESTS HIS GRATITUDE TO PITY HIS FAITHFULNESS TO ROSIAL AND THE
LADY THANKING HIM HEARTILY BIDS HIM ABIDE WITH HER TILL THE
SEASON OF MAY WHEN THE KING OF LOVE AND ALL HIS COMPANY WILL
HOLD HIS FEAST FULLY ROYALLY AND WELL
AND THERE I BODE TILL THAT
THE SEASON FELL
ON MAY DAY WHEN THE LARK BEGAN TO RISE
TO MATINS WENT THE LUSTY NIGHTINGALE
WITHIN A TEMPLE SHAPEN HAWTHORN WISE
HE MIGHT NOT SLEEP IN ALL THE NIGHTERTALE NIGHT TIME
BUT DOMINE 44 GAN HE CRY AND GALE CALL OUT
MY LIPPES OPEN LORD OF LOVE I CRY
AND LET MY MOUTH THY PRAISING NOW BEWRY SHOW FORTH

AND THEN CAME IN THE GOLDFINCH FRESH AND GAY

AND VENUS YET I THANK I AM ALIVE

IN THE KNIGHT'S TALE WE HAVE EXEMPLIFICATIONS OF THE
CUSTOM OF GATHERING AND WEARING FLOWERS AND BRANCHES ON MAY
DAY WHERE EMILY DOING OBSERVANCE TO MAY GOES INTO THE
GARDEN AT SUNRISE AND GATHERS FLOWERS PARTY WHITE AND RED TO
MAKE A SOTEL GARLAND FOR HER HEAD AND AGAIN WHERE ARCITE
RIDES TO THE FIELDS TO MAKE HIM A GARLAND OF THE GREVES WERE IT
OF WOODBINE OR OF HAWTHORN LEAVES
THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE
THE NOBLE VINDICATION OF TRUE LOVE AS AN EXALTING PURIFYING
AND HONOUR CONFERRING POWER WHICH CHAUCER HAS MADE IN THE
COURT OF LOVE IS REPEATED IN THE CUCKOO AND THE
NIGHTINGALE AT THE SAME TIME THE CLOSE OF THE POEM LEADS UP
TO THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS FOR ON THE APPEAL OF THE
NIGHTINGALE THE DISPUTE BETWEEN HER AND THE CUCKOO ON THE
MERITS AND BLESSINGS OF LOVE IS REFERRED TO A PARLIAMENT OF BIRDS
TO BE HELD ON THE MORROW AFTER SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY
TRUE THE
ASSEMBLY OF THE FEATHERED TRIBES DESCRIBED BY CHAUCER THOUGH
HELD ON SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY AND ENGAGED IN THE DISCUSSION OF
A CONTROVERSY REGARDING LOVE IS NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE PARTICULAR
CAUSE WHICH IN THE PRESENT POEM THE NIGHTINGALE APPEALS TO THE
PARLIAMENT
BUT THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE NONE THE LESS
SERVES AS A LINK BETWEEN THE TWO POEMS INDICATING AS IT DOES THE
NATURE OF THOSE CONTROVERSIES IN MATTERS SUBJECT TO THE SUPREME
CONTROL OF THE KING AND QUEEN OF LOVE WHICH IN THE SUBSEQUENT
POEM WE FIND THE COURTIERS UNDER THE GUISE OF BIRDS DEBATING IN
FULL CONCLAVE AND UNDER LEGAL FORMS
EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE IN
CONCEPTION AND WRITTEN IN A METRE FULL OF MUSICAL IRREGULARITY
AND FORCIBLE FREEDOM THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE YIELDS
IN VIVIDNESS DELICACY AND GRACE TO NONE OF CHAUCER'S MINOR
POEMS
WE ARE TOLD THAT THE POET ON THE THIRD NIGHT OF MAY IS
SLEEPLESS AND RISES EARLY IN THE MORNING TO TRY IF HE MAY HEAR
THE NIGHTINGALE SING
WANDERING BY A BROOK SIDE HE SITS DOWN
ON THE FLOWERY LAWN AND ERE LONG LULLED BY THE SWEET MELODY OF
MANY BIRDS AND THE WELL ACCORDING MUSIC OF THE STREAM HE FALLS
INTO A KIND OF DOZE NOT ALL ASLEEP NOR FULLY WAKING THEN
AN EVIL OMEN HE HEARS THE CUCKOO SING BEFORE THE NIGHTINGALE
BUT SOON HE HEARS THE NIGHTINGALE REQUEST THE CUCKOO TO
REMOVE FAR AWAY AND LEAVE THE PLACE TO BIRDS THAT CAN SING
THE
CUCKOO ENTERS INTO A DEFENCE OF HER SONG WHICH BECOMES A
RAILING ACCUSATION AGAINST LOVE AND A RECITAL OF THE MISERIES
WHICH LOVE'S SERVANTS ENDURE THE NIGHTINGALE VINDICATES LOVE
IN A LOFTY AND TENDER STRAIN BUT IS AT LAST OVERCOME WITH SORROW
BY THE BITTER WORDS OF THE CUCKOO AND CALLS ON THE GOD OF
LOVE FOR HELP
ON THIS THE POET STARTS UP AND SNATCHING A STONE
FROM THE BROOK THROWS IT AT THE CUCKOO WHO FLIES AWAY FULL
FAST
THE GRATEFUL NIGHTINGALE PROMISES THAT FOR THIS SERVICE SHE
WILL BE HER CHAMPION'S SINGER ALL THAT MAY SHE WARNS HIM
AGAINST BELIEVING THE CUCKOO THE FOE OF LOVE AND THEN HAVING
SUNG HIM ONE OF HER NEW SONGS SHE FLIES AWAY TO ALL THE OTHER
BIRDS THAT ARE IN THAT DALE ASSEMBLES THEM AND DEMANDS THAT
THEY SHOULD DO HER RIGHT UPON THE CUCKOO
BY ONE ASSENT IT IS
AGREED THAT A PARLIAMENT SHALL BE HELD THE MORROW AFTER SAINT
VALENTINE'S DAY UNDER A MAPLE BEFORE THE WINDOW OF QUEEN
PHILIPPA AT WOODSTOCK WHEN JUDGMENT SHALL BE PASSED UPON
THE CUCKOO THEN THE NIGHTINGALE FLIES INTO A HAWTHORN AND
SINGS A LAY OF LOVE SO LOUD THAT THE POET AWAKES
THE FIVE LINE
STANZA OF WHICH THE FIRST SECOND AND FIFTH LINES AGREE IN ONE
RHYME THE THIRD AND FOURTH IN ANOTHER IS PECULIAR TO THIS POEM
AND WHILE THE PREVAILING MEASURE IS THE DECASYLLABIC LINE USED IN
THE CANTERBURY TALES MANY OF THE LINES HAVE ONE OR TWO
SYLLABLES LESS
THE POEM IS GIVEN HERE WITHOUT ABRIDGEMENT
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE MODERN SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT CHAUCER WAS
NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS POEM
THE GOD OF LOVE AH BENEDICITE
HOW MIGHTY AND HOW GREAT A LORD IS HE 1
FOR HE CAN MAKE OF LOWE HEARTES HIGH
AND OF HIGH LOW AND LIKE FOR TO DIE
AND HARDE HEARTES HE CAN MAKE FREE
HE CAN MAKE WITHIN A LITTLE STOUND MOMENT
OF SICKE FOLKE WHOLE AND FRESH AND SOUND
AND OF THE WHOLE HE CAN MAKE SICK
HE CAN BIND AND UNBINDEN EKE
WHAT HE WILL HAVE BOUNDEN OR UNBOUND
TO TELL HIS MIGHT MY WIT MAY NOT SUFFICE
FOR HE CAN MAKE OF WISE FOLK FULL NICE FOOLISH
FOR HE MAY DO ALL THAT HE WILL DEVISE
AND LITHER FOLKE TO DESTROYE VICE IDLE VICIOUS
AND PROUDE HEARTES HE CAN MAKE AGRISE TREMBLE
SHORTLY ALL THAT EVER HE WILL HE MAY
AGAINST HIM DARE NO WIGHT SAY NAY
FOR HE CAN GLAD AND GRIEVE WHOM HIM LIKETH WHOM HE PLEASES
AND WHO THAT HE WILL HE LAUGHETH OR SIKETH SIGHETH
AND MOST HIS MIGHT HE SHEDDETH EVER IN MAY
FOR EVERY TRUE GENTLE HEARTE FREE
THAT WITH HIM IS OR THINKETH FOR TO BE
AGAINST MAY NOW SHALL HAVE SOME STIRRING IMPULSE
EITHER TO JOY OR ELSE TO SOME MOURNING
IN NO SEASON SO MUCH AS THINKETH ME
FOR WHEN THAT THEY MAY HEAR THE BIRDES SING
AND SEE THE FLOWERS AND THE LEAVES SPRING
THAT BRINGETH INTO HEARTE'S REMEMBRANCE
A MANNER EASE MEDLED WITH GRIEVANCE MINGLED WITH SORROW
AND LUSTY THOUGHTES FULL OF GREAT LONGING
AND OF THAT LONGING COMETH HEAVINESS
AND THEREOF GROWETH GREATE SICKENESS
AND 2 FOR THE LACK OF THAT THAT THEY DESIRE
AND THUS IN MAY BE HEARTES SET ON FIRE
SO THAT THEY BRENNEN FORTH IN GREAT DISTRESS
BURN
I SPEAKE THIS OF FEELING TRUELY
IF I BE OLD AND UNLUSTY
YET I HAVE FELT THE SICKNESS THOROUGH MAY
BOTH HOT AND COLD AN ACCESS EV'RY DAY EVERY DAY A HOT AND A
HOW SORE Y WIS THERE WOT NO WIGHT BUT I
COLD FIT
I AM SO SHAKEN WITH THE FEVERS WHITE
OF ALL THIS MAY SLEEP I BUT LITE LITTLE
AND ALSO IT IS NOT LIKE UNTO ME PLEASING
THAT ANY HEARTE SHOULDE SLEEPY BE
IN WHOM THAT LOVE HIS FIERY DART WILL SMITE
BUT AS I LAY THIS OTHER NIGHT WAKING
I THOUGHT HOW LOVERS HAD A TOKENING SIGNIFICANCE
AND AMONG THEM IT WAS A COMMON TALE
THAT IT WERE GOOD TO HEAR THE NIGHTINGALE
RATHER THAN THE LEWD CUCKOO SING
AND THEN I THOUGHT ANON IT WAS DAY WHENEVER
I WOULD GO SOMEWHERE TO ASSAY
IF THAT I MIGHT A NIGHTINGALE HEAR
FOR YET HAD I NONE HEARD OF ALL THAT YEAR
AND IT WAS THEN THE THIRDE NIGHT OF MAY
AND ANON AS I THE DAY ESPIED
NO LONGER WOULD I IN MY BED ABIDE
BUT TO A WOOD THAT WAS FAST BY
I WENT FORTH ALONE BOLDELY
AND HELD THE WAY DOWN BY A BROOKE'S SIDE
TILL I CAME TO A LAUND OF WHITE AND GREEN LAWN
SO FAIR A ONE HAD I NEVER IN BEEN
THE GROUND WAS GREEN Y POWDER'D WITH DAISY STREWN WITH DAISIES
THE FLOWERS AND THE GREVES LIKE HIGH BUSHES OF THE SAME HEIGHT
ALL GREEN AND WHITE WAS NOTHING ELLES SEEN
THERE SAT I DOWN AMONG THE FAIRE FLOW'RS
AND SAW THE BIRDES TRIP OUT OF THEIR BOW'RS
THERE AS THEY RESTED THEM ALLE THE NIGHT
THEY WERE SO JOYFUL OF THE DAYE'S LIGHT
THEY BEGAN OF MAY FOR TO DO HONOURS
THEY COUD THAT SERVICE ALL BY ROTE KNEW
THERE WAS MANY A LOVELY NOTE
SOME SANGE LOUD AS THEY HAD PLAIN'D
AND SOME IN OTHER MANNER VOICE FEIGN'D
AND SOME ALL OUT WITH THE FULL THROAT
THEY PROINED THEM AND MADE THEM RIGHT GAY PREENED THEIR FEATHERS
AND DANC'D AND LEAPT UPON THE SPRAY
AND EVERMORE TWO AND TWO IN FERE TOGETHER
RIGHT SO AS THEY HAD CHOSEN THEM TO YEAR THIS YEAR
IN FEVERERE UPON SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY
FEBRUARY
AND THE RIVER THAT I SAT UPON BESIDE
IT MADE SUCH A NOISE AS IT RAN
ACCORDANT WITH THE BIRDE'S HARMONY KEEPING TIME WITH
ME THOUGHT IT WAS THE BESTE MELODY
THAT MIGHT BE HEARD OF ANY MAN
AND FOR DELIGHT I WOTE NEVER HOW
I FELL IN SUCH A SLUMBER AND A SWOW SWOON
NOT ALL ASLEEP NOR FULLY WAKING
AND IN THAT SWOW ME THOUGHT I HEARDE SING
THE SORRY BIRD THE LEWD CUCKOW
AND THAT WAS ON A TREE RIGHT FASTE BY
BUT WHO WAS THEN EVIL APAID BUT I DISSATISFIED
NOW GOD QUOTH I THAT DIED ON THE CROIS CROSS
GIVE SORROW ON THEE AND ON THY LEWED VOICE
FULL LITTLE JOY HAVE I NOW OF THY CRY
AND AS I WITH THE CUCKOO THUS GAN CHIDE
I HEARD IN THE NEXT BUSH BESIDE
A NIGHTINGALE SO LUSTILY SING
THAT HER CLEAR VOICE SHE MADE RING
THROUGH ALL THE GREENWOOD WIDE
AH GOOD NIGHTINGALE QUOTH I THEN
A LITTLE HAST THOU BEEN TOO LONG HEN HENCE ABSENT
FOR HERE HATH BEEN THE LEWD CUCKOW
AND SUNG SONGS RATHER THAN HAST THOU SOONER
I PRAY TO GOD THAT EVIL FIRE HER BREN BURN
BUT NOW I WILL YOU TELL A WONDROUS THING
AS LONG AS I LAY IN THAT SWOONING
ME THOUGHT I WIST WHAT THE BIRDS MEANT
AND WHAT THEY SAID AND WHAT WAS THEIR INTENT
AND OF THEIR SPEECH I HADDE GOOD KNOWING
THERE HEARD I THE NIGHTINGALE SAY
NOW GOOD CUCKOO GO SOMEWHERE AWAY
AND LET US THAT CAN SINGE DWELLE HERE
FOR EV'RY WIGHT ESCHEWETH THEE TO HEAR SHUNS
THY SONGES BE SO ELENGE IN GOOD FAY STRANGE FAITH
WHAT QUOTH SHE WHAT MAY THEE ALL NOW
IT THINKETH ME I SING AS WELL AS THOU
FOR MY SONG IS BOTH TRUE AND PLAIN
ALTHOUGH I CANNOT CRAKEL SO IN VAIN SING TREMULOUSLY
AS THOU DOST IN THY THROAT I WOT NE'ER HOW
AND EV'RY WIGHT MAY UNDERSTANDE ME
BUT NIGHTINGALE SO MAY THEY NOT DO THEE
FOR THOU HAST MANY A NICE QUAINT CRY FOOLISH
I HAVE THEE HEARD SAY 'OCY OCY 3
HOW MIGHT I KNOW WHAT THAT SHOULD BE
AH FOOL QUOTH SHE WOST THOU NOT WHAT IT IS
WHEN THAT I SAY 'OCY OCY Y WIS
THEN MEAN I THAT I WOULDE WONDER FAIN
THAT ALL THEY WERE SHAMEFULLY SLAIN DIE
THAT MEANEN AUGHT AGAINE LOVE AMISS
AND ALSO I WOULD THAT ALL THOSE WERE DEAD
THAT THINKE NOT IN LOVE THEIR LIFE TO LEAD
FOR WHO SO WILL THE GOD OF LOVE NOT SERVE
I DARE WELL SAY HE IS WORTHY TO STERVE DIE
AND FOR THAT SKILL 'OCY OCY I GREDE REASON CRY
EY QUOTH THE CUCKOO THIS IS A QUAINT LAW STRANGE
THAT EVERY WIGHT SHALL LOVE OR BE TO DRAW TORN TO PIECES
BUT I FORSAKE ALLE SUCH COMPANY
FOR MINE INTENT IS NOT FOR TO DIE
NOR EVER WHILE I LIVE ON LOVE'S YOKE TO DRAW TO PUT ON LOVE'S
YOKE
FOR LOVERS BE THE FOLK THAT BE ALIVE
THAT MOST DISEASE HAVE AND MOST UNTHRIVE MISFORTUNE
AND MOST ENDURE SORROW WOE AND CARE
AND LEASTE FEELEN OF WELFARE
WHAT NEEDETH IT AGAINST THE TRUTH TO STRIVE
WHAT QUOTH SHE THOU ART ALL OUT OF THY MIND
HOW MIGHTEST THOU IN THY CHURLISHNESS FIND
TO SPEAK OF LOVE'S SERVANTS IN THIS WISE
FOR IN THIS WORLD IS NONE SO GOOD SERVICE
TO EV'RY WIGHT THAT GENTLE IS OF KIND
FOR THEREOF TRULY COMETH ALL GLADNESS
ALL HONOUR AND ALL GENTLENESS
WORSHIP EASE AND ALL HEARTE'S LUST PLEASURE
PERFECT JOY AND FULL ASSURED TRUST
JOLLITY PLEASANCE AND FRESHNESS
LOWLIHEAD LARGESS AND COURTESY
SEEMELIHEAD AND TRUE COMPANY
DREAD OF SHAME FOR TO DO AMISS
FOR HE THAT TRULY LOVE'S SERVANT IS
WERE LOTHER TO BE SHAMED THAN TO DIE
MORE RELUCTANT
AND THAT THIS IS SOOTH THAT I SAY
IN THAT BELIEF I WILL LIVE AND DEY
AND CUCKOO SO I REDE THAT THOU DO Y WIS COUNSEL
THEN QUOTH HE LET ME NEVER HAVE BLISS
IF EVER I TO THAT COUNSAIL OBEY
NIGHTINGALE THOU SPEAKEST WONDROUS FAIR
BUT FOR ALL THAT IS THE SOOTH CONTRAIR
FOR LOVE IS IN YOUNG FOLK BUT RAGE
AND IN OLD FOLK A GREAT DOTAGE
WHO MOST IT USETH MOSTE SHALL ENPAIR SUFFER HARM
FOR THEREOF COME DISEASE AND HEAVINESS
SORROW AND CARE AND MANY A GREAT SICKNESS
DESPITE DEBATE ANGER ENVY
DEPRAVING SHAME UNTRUST AND JEALOUSY LOSS OF FAME OR CHARACTER
PRIDE MISCHIEF POVERT' AND WOODNESS MADNESS
LOVING IS AN OFFICE OF DESPAIR
AND ONE THING IS THEREIN THAT IS NOT FAIR
FOR WHO THAT GETS OF LOVE A LITTLE BLISS
BUT IF HE BE AWAY THEREWITH Y WIS
HE MAY FULL SOON OF AGE HAVE HIS HAIR SEE NOTE 5
AND NIGHTINGALE THEREFORE HOLD THEE NIGH
FOR 'LIEVE ME WELL FOR ALL THY QUAINTE CRY
IF THOU BE FAR OR LONGE FROM THY MAKE MATE
THOU SHALT BE AS OTHER THAT BE FORSAKE
AND THEN THOU SHALT HOTEN AS DO I BE CALLED
FIE QUOTH SHE ON THY NAME AND ON THEE
THE GOD OF LOVE LET THEE NEVER THE THRIVE
FOR THOU ART WORSE A THOUSAND FOLD THAN WOOD MAD
FOR MANY ONE IS FULL WORTHY AND FULL GOOD
THAT HAD BEEN NAUGHT NE HADDE LOVE Y BE
FOR EVERMORE LOVE HIS SERVANTS AMENDETH
AND FROM ALL EVILE TACHES THEM DEFENDETH BLEMISHES
AND MAKETH THEM TO BURN RIGHT IN A FIRE
IN TRUTH AND IN WORSHIPFUL DESIRE HONOURABLE
AND WHEN HIM LIKETH JOY ENOUGH THEM SENDETH
THOU NIGHTINGALE HE SAID BE STILL
FOR LOVE HATH NO REASON BUT HIS WILL
FOR OFTTIME UNTRUE FOLK HE EASETH
AND TRUE FOLK SO BITTERLY DISPLEASETH
THAT FOR DEFAULT OF GRACE HE LETS THEM SPILL FAVOUR BE RUINED
THEN TOOK I OF THE NIGHTINGALE KEEP
HOW SHE CAST A SIGH OUT OF HER DEEP
AND SAID ALAS THAT EVER I WAS BORE
I CAN FOR TEEN NOT SAY ONE WORDE MORE VEXATION GRIEF
AND RIGHT WITH THAT WORD SHE BURST OUT TO WEEP
ALAS QUOTH SHE MY HEARTE WILL TO BREAK
TO HEARE THUS THIS LEWD BIRD SPEAK
OF LOVE AND OF HIS WORSHIPFUL SERVICE
NOW GOD OF LOVE THOU HELP ME IN SOME WISE
THAT I MAY ON THIS CUCKOO BE AWREAK REVENGED
METHOUGHT THEN I START UP ANON
AND TO THE BROOK I RAN AND GOT A STONE
AND AT THE CUCKOO HEARTLY CAST
AND FOR DREAD HE FLEW AWAY FULL FAST
AND GLAD WAS I WHEN HE WAS GONE
AND EVERMORE THE CUCKOO AS HE FLAY FLEW
HE SAIDE FAREWELL FAREWELL POPINJAY
AS THOUGH HE HAD SCORNED THOUGHT ME
BUT AY I HUNTED HIM FROM THE TREE
UNTIL HE WAS FAR OUT OF SIGHT AWAY
AND THEN CAME THE NIGHTINGALE TO ME
AND SAID FRIEND FORSOOTH I THANK THEE
THAT THOU HAST LIK'D ME TO RESCOW RESCUE
AND ONE AVOW TO LOVE MAKE I NOW
THAT ALL THIS MAY I WILL THY SINGER BE
I THANKED HER AND WAS RIGHT WELL APAID SATISFIED
YEA QUOTH SHE AND BE THOU NOT DISMAY'D
THOUGH THOU HAVE HEARD THE CUCKOO ERST THAN ME 6 BEFORE
FOR IF I LIVE IT SHALL AMENDED BE
THE NEXT MAY IF I BE NOT AFRAID
AND ONE THING I WILL REDE THEE ALSO
BELIEVE THOU NOT THE CUCKOO THE LOVE'S FOE
FOR ALL THAT HE HATH SAID IS STRONG LEASING FALSEHOOD
NAY QUOTH I THERETO SHALL NOTHING ME BRING
FOR LOVE AND IT HATH DONE ME MUCH WOE
YEA USE QUOTH SHE THIS MEDICINE
EVERY DAY THIS MAY ERE THOU DINE
GO LOOK UPON THE FRESH DAISY
AND THOUGH THOU BE FOR WOE IN POINT TO DIE
THAT SHALL FULL GREATLY LESS THEE OF THY PINE SORROW
AND LOOK ALWAY THAT THOU BE GOOD AND TRUE
AND I WILL SING ONE OF MY SONGES NEW
FOR LOVE OF THEE AS LOUD AS I MAY CRY
AND THEN SHE BEGAN THIS SONG FULL HIGH
I SHREW ALL THEM THAT BE OF LOVE UNTRUE CURSE
AND WHEN SHE HAD SUNG IT TO THE END
NOW FAREWELL QUOTH SHE FOR I MUST WEND GO
AND GOD OF LOVE THAT CAN RIGHT WELL AND MAY
AS MUCH JOY SENDE THEE THIS DAY
AS ANY LOVER YET HE EVER SEND
THUS TOOK THE NIGHTINGALE HER LEAVE OF ME
I PRAY TO GOD ALWAY WITH HER BE
AND JOY OF LOVE HE SEND HER EVERMORE
AND SHIELD US FROM THE CUCKOO AND HIS LORE
FOR THERE IS NOT SO FALSE A BIRD AS HE
FORTH SHE FLEW THE GENTLE NIGHTINGALE
TO ALL THE BIRDES THAT WERE IN THAT DALE
AND GOT THEM ALL INTO A PLACE IN FERE TOGETHER
AND BESOUGHT THEM THAT THEY WOULD HEAR
HER DISEASE AND THUS BEGAN HER TALE
DISTRESS GRIEVANCE
YE WITTE WELL IT IS NOT FOR TO HIDE KNOW
HOW THE CUCKOO AND I FAST HAVE CHIDE QUARRELLED
EVER SINCE THAT IT WAS DAYLIGHT
I PRAY YOU ALL THAT YE DO ME RIGHT
ON THAT FOUL FALSE UNKIND BRIDE BIRD
THEN SPAKE ONE BIRD FOR ALL BY ONE ASSENT
THIS MATTER ASKETH GOOD ADVISEMENT
FOR WE BE FEWE BIRDES HERE IN FERE
AND SOOTH IT IS THE CUCKOO IS NOT HERE
AND THEREFORE WE WILL HAVE A PARLEMENT
AND THEREAT SHALL THE EAGLE BE OUR LORD
AND OTHER PEERS THAT BEEN OF RECORD OF ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY
AND THE CUCKOO SHALL BE AFTER SENT SUMMONED
THERE SHALL BE GIVEN THE JUDGMENT
OR ELSE WE SHALL FINALLY MAKE ACCORD BE RECONCILED
AND THIS SHALL BE WITHOUTE NAY CONTRADICTION
THE MORROW AFTER SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY
UNDER A MAPLE THAT IS FAIR AND GREEN
BEFORE THE CHAMBER WINDOW OF THE QUEEN 7
AT WOODSTOCK UPON THE GREEN LAY LAWN
SHE THANKED THEM AND THEN HER LEAVE TOOK
AND INTO A HAWTHORN BY THAT BROOK
AND THERE SHE SAT AND SANG UPON THAT TREE
TERM OF LIFE LOVE HATH WITHHOLD ME LOVE HATH ME IN HER
SO LOUDE THAT I WITH THAT SONG AWOKE
SERVICE ALL MY LIFE

THE QUEEN PHILIPPA OF HAINAULT WIFE OF EDWARD III
THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS
IN THE ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS WHICH CHAUCER'S RETRACTATION
DESCRIBES AS THE BOOK OF SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY OR OF THE
PARLIAMENT OF BIRDS WE ARE PRESENTED WITH A PICTURE OF THE
MEDIAEVAL COURT OF LOVE FAR CLOSER TO THE REALITY THAN WE FIND
IN CHAUCER'S POEM WHICH BEARS THAT EXPRESS TITLE
WE HAVE A
REGULARLY CONSTITUTED CONCLAVE OR TRIBUNAL UNDER A PRESIDENT
WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL
A DIFFICULT QUESTION IS PROPOSED FOR
THE CONSIDERATION AND JUDGMENT OF THE COURT THE DISPUTANTS
ADVANCING AND VINDICATING THEIR CLAIMS IN PERSON
THE ATTENDANTS
UPON THE COURT THROUGH SPECIALLY CHOSEN MOUTHPIECES DELIVER
THEIR OPINIONS ON THE CAUSE AND FINALLY A DECISION IS
AUTHORITATIVELY PRONOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT WHICH AS IN
MANY OF THE CASES ACTUALLY JUDGED BEFORE THE COURTS OF LOVE IN
FRANCE PLACES THE REASONABLE AND MODEST WISH OF A SENSITIVE
AND CHASTE LADY ABOVE ALL THE EAGERNESS OF HER LOVERS ALL THE
INCONGRUOUS COUNSELS OF REPRESENTATIVE COURTIERS
SO FAR
THEREFORE AS THE POEM REPRODUCES THE CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF
PROCEDURE IN THOSE ROMANTIC MIDDLE AGE HALLS OF AMATORY
JUSTICE CHAUCER'S ASSEMBLY OF FOWLS IS HIS REAL COURT OF
LOVE FOR ALTHOUGH IN THE CASTLE AND AMONG THE COURTIERS OF
ADMETUS AND ALCESTIS WE HAVE ALL THE PERSONAGES AND
MACHINERY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THOSE EROTIC CONTENTIONS IN THE
PRESENT POEM WE SEE THE PERSONAGES AND THE MACHINERY ACTUALLY
AT WORK UPON ANOTHER SCENE AND UNDER OTHER GUISES
THE
ALLEGORY WHICH MAKES THE CONTENTION ARISE OUT OF THE LOVES AND
PROCEED IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE FEATHERED RACE IS QUITE IN
KEEPING WITH THE FANCIFUL YET NATURE LOVING SPIRIT OF THE POETRY
OF CHAUCER'S TIME IN WHICH THE INFLUENCE OF THE TROUBADOURS
WAS STILL LARGELY PRESENT
IT IS QUITE IN KEEPING ALSO WITH THE
PRINCIPLES THAT REGULATED THE COURTS THE PURPOSE OF WHICH WAS
MORE TO DISCUSS AND DETERMINE THE PROPER CONDUCT OF LOVE
AFFAIRS THAN TO SECURE CONVICTION OR ACQUITTAL SANCTION OR
REPROBATION IN PARTICULAR CASES THOUGH THE JURISDICTION AND
THE JUDGMENTS OF SUCH ASSEMBLIES OFTEN CLOSELY CONCERNED
INDIVIDUALS
CHAUCER INTRODUCES US TO HIS MAIN THEME THROUGH
THE VESTIBULE OF A FANCIED DREAM A METHOD WHICH BE
REPEATEDLY EMPLOYS WITH GREAT RELISH AS FOR INSTANCE IN THE
HOUSE OF FAME HE HAS SPENT THE WHOLE DAY OVER CICERO'S
ACCOUNT OF THE DREAM OF SCIPIO AFRICANUS THE YOUNGER AND
HAVING GONE TO BED HE DREAMS THAT AFRICANUS THE ELDER APPEARS
TO HIM JUST AS IN THE BOOK HE APPEARED TO HIS NAMESAKE AND
CARRIES HIM INTO A BEAUTIFUL PARK IN WHICH IS A FAIR GARDEN BY A
RIVER SIDE
HERE THE POET IS LED INTO A SPLENDID TEMPLE THROUGH A
CROWD OF COURTIERS ALLEGORICALLY REPRESENTING THE VARIOUS
INSTRUMENTS PLEASURES EMOTIONS AND ENCOURAGEMENTS OF LOVE
AND IN THE TEMPLE VENUS HERSELF IS FOUND SPORTING WITH HER
PORTER RICHESS
RETURNING INTO THE GARDEN HE SEES THE GODDESS
OF NATURE SEATED ON A HILL OF FLOWERS AND BEFORE HER ARE
ASSEMBLED ALL THE BIRDS FOR IT IS SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY WHEN
EVERY FOWL CHOOSES HER MATE
HAVING WITH A GRAPHIC TOUCH
ENUMERATED AND DESCRIBED THE PRINCIPAL BIRDS THE POET SEES THAT
ON HER HAND NATURE BEARS A FEMALE EAGLE OF SURPASSING LOVELINESS
AND VIRTUE FOR WHICH THREE MALE EAGLES ADVANCE CONTENDING
CLAIMS
THE DISPUTATION LASTS ALL DAY AND AT EVENING THE
ASSEMBLED BIRDS EAGER TO BE GONE WITH THEIR MATES CLAMOUR FOR
A DECISION
THE TERCELET THE GOOSE THE CUCKOO AND THE TURTLE
FOR BIRDS OF PREY WATER FOWL WORM FOWL AND SEED FOWL
RESPECTIVELY PRONOUNCE THEIR VERDICTS ON THE DISPUTE IN
SPEECHES FULL OF CHARACTER AND HUMOUR BUT NATURE REFERS THE
DECISION BETWEEN THE THREE CLAIMANTS TO THE FEMALE EAGLE HERSELF
WHO PRAYS THAT SHE MAY HAVE A YEAR'S RESPITE
NATURE GRANTS THE
PRAYER PRONOUNCES JUDGMENT ACCORDINGLY AND DISMISSES THE
ASSEMBLY AND AFTER A CHOSEN CHOIR HAS SUNG A ROUNDEL IN HONOUR
OF THE GODDESS ALL THE BIRDS FLY AWAY AND THE POET AWAKES
IT IS
PROBABLE THAT CHAUCER DERIVED THE IDEA OF THE POEM FROM A
FRENCH SOURCE MR BELL GIVES THE OUTLINE OF A FABLIAU OF WHICH
THREE VERSIONS EXISTED AND IN WHICH A CONTENTION BETWEEN TWO
LADIES REGARDING THE MERITS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LOVERS A KNIGHT
AND A CLERK IS DECIDED BY CUPID IN A COURT COMPOSED OF BIRDS
WHICH ASSUME THEIR SIDES ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT NATURES
WHATEVER THE SOURCE OF THE IDEA ITS MANAGEMENT AND THE WHOLE
WORKMANSHIP OF THE POEM ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE HUMOROUS
PASSAGES ARE ESSENTIALLY CHAUCER'S OWN
THE LIFE SO SHORT THE CRAFT SO LONG TO LEARN
TH'ASSAY SO HARD SO SHARP THE CONQUERING
THE DREADFUL JOY ALWAY THAT FLITS SO YERN FLEETS SO FAST
ALL THIS MEAN I BY LOVE THAT MY FEELING WITH REFERENCE TO
ASTONETH WITH HIS WONDERFUL WORKING AMAZES
SO SORE Y WIS THAT WHEN I ON HIM THINK
NAUGHT WIT I WELL WHETHER I FLEET OR SINK FLOAT
FOR ALL BE THAT I KNOW NOT LOVE INDEED ALBEIT ALTHOUGH
NOR WOT HOW THAT HE QUITETH FOLK THEIR HIRE REWARDS FOLK FOR
YET HAPPETH ME FULL OFT IN BOOKS TO READ THEIR SERVICE
OF HIS MIRACLES AND OF HIS CRUEL IRE
THERE READ I WELL HE WILL BE LORD AND SIRE
I DARE NOT SAYE THAT HIS STROKES BE SORE
BUT GOD SAVE SUCH A LORD I CAN NO MORE
OF USAGE WHAT FOR LUST AND WHAT FOR LORE
ON BOOKES READ I OFT AS I YOU TOLD
BUT WHEREFORE SPEAK I ALLE THIS NOT YORE
AGONE IT HAPPED ME FOR TO BEHOLD
UPON A BOOK WRITTEN WITH LETTERS OLD
AND THEREUPON A CERTAIN THING TO LEARN
THE LONGE DAY FULL FAST I READ AND YERN EAGERLY
FOR OUT OF THE OLD FIELDES AS MEN SAITH
COMETH ALL THIS NEW CORN FROM YEAR TO YEAR
AND OUT OF OLDE BOOKES IN GOOD FAITH
COMETH ALL THIS NEW SCIENCE THAT MEN LEAR LEARN
BUT NOW TO PURPOSE AS OF THIS MATTERE
TO READE FORTH IT GAN ME SO DELIGHT
THAT ALL THE DAY ME THOUGHT IT BUT A LITE LITTLE WHILE
THIS BOOK OF WHICH I MAKE MENTION
ENTITLED WAS RIGHT THUS AS I SHALL TELL
TULLIUS OF THE DREAM OF SCIPION 1
CHAPTERS SEVEN IT HAD OF HEAV'N AND HELL
AND EARTH AND SOULES THAT THEREIN DO DWELL
OF WHICH AS SHORTLY AS I CAN IT TREAT
OF HIS SENTENCE I WILL YOU SAY THE GREAT IMPORTANT PART
FIRST TELLETH IT WHEN SCIPIO WAS COME
TO AFRICA HOW HE MET MASSINISSE
THAT HIM FOR JOY IN ARMES HATH Y NOME TAKEN 2
THEN TELLETH HE THEIR SPEECH AND ALL THE BLISS
THAT WAS BETWEEN THEM TILL THE DAY GAN MISS FAIL
AND HOW HIS ANCESTOR AFRICANE SO DEAR
GAN IN HIS SLEEP THAT NIGHT TO HIM APPEAR
THEN TELLETH IT THAT FROM A STARRY PLACE
HOW AFRICANE HATH HIM CARTHAGE Y SHEW'D
AND WARNED HIM BEFORE OF ALL HIS GRACE 3
AND SAID HIM WHAT MAN LEARNED EITHER LEWD IGNORANT
THAT LOVETH COMMON PROFIT WELL Y THEW'D THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
HE SHOULD UNTO A BLISSFUL PLACE WEND GO
WHERE AS THE JOY IS WITHOUT ANY END
THEN ASKED HE IF FOLK THAT HERE BE DEAD I E
THE YOUNGER SCIPIO
HAVE LIFE AND DWELLING IN ANOTHER PLACE
AND AFRICANE SAID YEA WITHOUTE DREAD DOUBT
AND HOW OUR PRESENT WORLDLY LIVES' SPACE
MEANT BUT A MANNER DEATH 4 WHAT WAY WE TRACE
AND RIGHTFUL FOLK SHOULD GO AFTER THEY DIE
TO HEAV'N AND SHOWED HIM THE GALAXY
THEN SHOW'D HE HIM THE LITTLE EARTH THAT HERE IS
TO REGARD THE HEAVEN'S QUANTITY BY COMPARISON WITH
AND AFTER SHOW'D HE HIM THE NINE SPHERES 5
AND AFTER THAT THE MELODY HEARD HE
THAT COMETH OF THOSE SPHERES THRICE THREE
THAT WELLS OF MUSIC BE AND MELODY
IN THIS WORLD HERE AND CAUSE OF HARMONY
THEN SAID HE HIM SINCE EARTHE WAS SO LITE SMALL
AND FULL OF TORMENT AND OF HARDE GRACE EVIL FORTUNE
THAT HE SHOULD NOT HIM IN THIS WORLD DELIGHT
THEN TOLD HE HIM IN CERTAIN YEARES' SPACE
THAT EV'RY STAR SHOULD COME INTO HIS PLACE
WHERE IT WAS FIRST AND ALL SHOULD OUT OF MIND PERISH FROM MEMORY
THAT IN THIS WORLD IS DONE OF ALL MANKIND
THEN PRAY'D HIM SCIPIO TO TELL HIM ALL
THE WAY TO COME INTO THAT HEAVEN'S BLISS
AND HE SAID FIRST KNOW THYSELF IMMORTAL
AND LOOK AYE BUSILY THAT THOU WORK AND WISS GUIDE AFFAIRS
TO COMMON PROFIT AND THOU SHALT NOT MISS
TO COME SWIFTLY UNTO THAT PLACE DEAR
THAT FULL OF BLISS IS AND OF SOULES CLEAR NOBLE 6
AND BREAKERS OF THE LAW THE SOOTH TO SAYN
AND LIKEROUS FOLK AFTER THAT THEY BE DEAD LECHEROUS
SHALL WHIRL ABOUT THE WORLD ALWAYS IN PAIN
TILL MANY A WORLD BE PASSED OUT OF DREAD WITHOUT DOUBT
AND THEN FORGIVEN ALL THEIR WICKED DEED
THEY SHALLE COME UNTO THAT BLISSFUL PLACE
TO WHICH TO COME GOD THEE SENDE GRACE
THE DAY GAN FAILEN AND THE DARKE NIGHT
THAT REAVETH BEASTES FROM THEIR BUSINESS TAKETH AWAY
BEREFTE ME MY BOOK FOR LACK OF LIGHT
AND TO MY BED I GAN ME FOR TO DRESS PREPARE
FULL FILL'D OF THOUGHT AND BUSY HEAVINESS
FOR BOTH I HADDE THING WHICH THAT I N'OLD WOULD NOT
AND EKE I HAD NOT THAT THING THAT I WO'LD
BUT FINALLY MY SPIRIT AT THE LAST
FORWEARY OF MY LABOUR ALL THAT DAY UTTERLY WEARIED
TOOK REST THAT MADE ME TO SLEEPE FAST
AND IN MY SLEEP I METTE AS THAT I SAY DREAMED
HOW AFRICANE RIGHT IN THE SELF ARRAY SAME GARB
THAT SCIPIO HIM SAW BEFORE THAT TIDE TIME
WAS COME AND STOOD RIGHT AT MY BEDDE'S SIDE
THE WEARY HUNTER SLEEPING IN HIS BED
TO WOOD AGAIN HIS MIND GOETH ANON
THE JUDGE DREAMETH HOW HIS PLEAS BE SPED
THE CARTER DREAMETH HOW HIS CARTES GO'N
THE RICH OF GOLD THE KNIGHT FIGHTS WITH HIS FONE FOES
THE SICKE METTE HE DRINKETH OF THE TUN 7
THE LOVER METTE HE HATH HIS LADY WON
I CANNOT SAY IF THAT THE CAUSE WERE
FOR I HAD READ OF AFRICANE BEFORN BECAUSE
THAT MADE ME TO METTE THAT HE STOOD THERE
BUT THUS SAID HE THOU HAST THEE SO WELL BORNE
IN LOOKING OF MINE OLD BOOK ALL TO TORN
OF WHICH MACROBIUS RAUGHT NOT A LITE RECKED NOT A LITTLE
THAT SOMEDEAL OF THY LABOUR WOULD I QUITE I WOULD REWARD YOU FOR
SOME OF YOUR LABOUR
CYTHEREA THOU BLISSFUL LADY SWEET
THAT WITH THY FIREBRAND DAUNTEST WHEN THEE LEST WHEN YOU PLEASE
THAT MADEST ME THIS SWEVEN FOR TO METTE DREAM
BE THOU MY HELP IN THIS FOR THOU MAY'ST BEST
AS WISLY AS I SAW THE NORTH NORTH WEST 8 SURELY
WHEN I BEGAN MY SWEVEN FOR TO WRITE
SO GIVE ME MIGHT TO RHYME IT AND ENDITE WRITE DOWN
THIS FORESAID AFRICANE ME HENT ANON TOOK
AND FORTH WITH HIM UNTO A GATE BROUGHT
RIGHT OF A PARK WALLED WITH GREENE STONE
AND O'ER THE GATE WITH LETTERS LARGE Y WROUGHT
THERE WERE VERSES WRITTEN AS ME THOUGHT
ON EITHER HALF OF FULL GREAT DIFFERENCE
OF WHICH I SHALL YOU SAY THE PLAIN SENTENCE MEANING
THROUGH ME MEN GO INTO THE BLISSFUL PLACE 9
OF HEARTE'S HEAL AND DEADLY WOUNDES' CURE
THROUGH ME MEN GO UNTO THE WELL OF GRACE
WHERE GREEN AND LUSTY MAY SHALL EVER DURE
THIS IS THE WAY TO ALL GOOD ADVENTURE
BE GLAD THOU READER AND THY SORROW OFF CAST
ALL OPEN AM I PASS IN AND SPEED THEE FAST
THROUGH ME MEN GO THUS SPAKE THE OTHER SIDE
UNTO THE MORTAL STROKES OF THE SPEAR
OF WHICH DISDAIN AND DANGER IS THE GUIDE
THERE NEVER TREE SHALL FRUIT NOR LEAVES BEAR
THIS STREAM YOU LEADETH TO THE SORROWFUL WEIR
WHERE AS THE FISH IN PRISON IS ALL DRY 10
TH'ESCHEWING IS THE ONLY REMEDY
THESE VERSES OF GOLD AND AZURE WRITTEN WERE
ON WHICH I GAN ASTONISH'D TO BEHOLD
FOR WITH THAT ONE INCREASED ALL MY FEAR
AND WITH THAT OTHER GAN MY HEART TO BOLD TAKE COURAGE
THAT ONE ME HET THAT OTHER DID ME COLD HEATED
NO WIT HAD I FOR ERROR FOR TO CHOOSE PERPLEXITY CONFUSION
TO ENTER OR FLY OR ME TO SAVE OR LOSE
RIGHT AS BETWIXTEN ADAMANTES TWO MAGNETS
OF EVEN WEIGHT A PIECE OF IRON SET
NE HATH NO MIGHT TO MOVE TO NOR FRO
FOR WHAT THE ONE MAY HALE THE OTHER LET ATTRACT RESTRAIN
SO FAR'D I THAT N'IST WHETHER ME WAS BET KNEW NOT WHETHER IT WAS
T' ENTER OR LEAVE TILL AFRICANE MY GUIDE BETTER FOR ME
ME HENT AND SHOV'D IN AT THE GATES WIDE
CAUGHT
AND SAID IT STANDETH WRITTEN IN THY FACE
THINE ERROR THOUGH THOU TELL IT NOT TO ME PERPLEXITY CONFUSION
BUT DREAD THOU NOT TO COME INTO THIS PLACE
FOR THIS WRITING IS NOTHING MEANT BY THEE DOES NOT REFER TO

FOR THOU OF LOVE HAST LOST THY TASTE I GUESS
AS SICK MAN HATH OF SWEET AND BITTERNESS
BUT NATHELESS ALTHOUGH THAT THOU BE DULL
THAT THOU CANST NOT DO YET THOU MAYEST SEE
FOR MANY A MAN THAT MAY NOT STAND A PULL
YET LIKES IT HIM AT WRESTLING FOR TO BE

AND IF THOU HADDEST CUNNING TO ENDITE SKILL
I SHALL THEE SHOWE MATTER OF TO WRITE TO WRITE ABOUT
WITH THAT MY HAND IN HIS HE TOOK ANON
OF WHICH I COMFORT CAUGHT AND WENT IN FAST

BUT LORD SO I WAS GLAD AND WELL BEGONE FORTUNATE
FOR OVER ALL WHERE I MY EYEN CAST EVERYWHERE
WERE TREES Y CLAD WITH LEAVES THAT AY SHALL LAST
EACH IN HIS KIND WITH COLOUR FRESH AND GREEN
AS EMERALD THAT JOY IT WAS TO SEE'N
THE BUILDER OAK AND EKE THE HARDY ASH
THE PILLAR ELM THE COFFER UNTO CARRAIN
THE BOX PIPE TREE THE HOLM TO WHIPPE'S LASH
THE SAILING FIR THE CYPRESS DEATH TO PLAIN
THE SHOOTER YEW THE ASPE FOR SHAFTES PLAIN
TH'OLIVE OF PEACE AND EKE THE DRUNKEN VINE
THE VICTOR PALM THE LAUREL TOO DIVINE
11
A GARDEN SAW I FULL OF BLOSSOM'D BOUGHES
UPON A RIVER IN A GREENE MEAD
WHERE AS SWEETNESS EVERMORE ENOW IS
WITH FLOWERS WHITE BLUE YELLOW AND RED
AND COLDE WELLE STREAMES NOTHING DEAD FOUNTAIN
THAT SWAMME FULL OF SMALLE FISHES LIGHT
WITH FINNES RED AND SCALES SILVER BRIGHT
ON EV'RY BOUGH THE BIRDES HEARD I SING
WITH VOICE OF ANGELS IN THEIR HARMONY
THAT BUSIED THEM THEIR BIRDES FORTH TO BRING
THE PRETTY CONIES TO THEIR PLAY GAN HIE RABBITS HASTE
AND FURTHER ALL ABOUT I GAN ESPY
THE DREADFUL ROE THE BUCK THE HART AND HIND TIMID
SQUIRRELS AND BEASTES SMALL OF GENTLE KIND NATURE
OF INSTRUMENTS OF STRINGES IN ACCORD
HEARD I SO PLAY A RAVISHING SWEETNESS
THAT GOD THAT MAKER IS OF ALL AND LORD
NE HEARDE NEVER BETTER AS I GUESS
THEREWITH A WIND UNNETH IT MIGHT BE LESS SCARCELY
MADE IN THE LEAVES GREEN A NOISE SOFT
ACCORDANT THE FOWLES' SONG ON LOFT IN KEEPING WITH ABOVE
TH'AIR OF THE PLACE SO ATTEMPER WAS MILD
THAT NE'ER WAS THERE GRIEVANCE OF HOT NOR COLD ANNOYANCE
THERE WAS EKE EV'RY WHOLESOME SPICE AND GRASS
NOR NO MAN MAY THERE WAXE SICK NOR OLD
YET WAS THERE MORE JOY A THOUSAND FOLD MOREOVER
THAN I CAN TELL OR EVER COULD OR MIGHT
THERE EVER IS CLEAR DAY AND NEVER NIGHT
UNDER A TREE BESIDE A WELL I SEY SAW
CUPID OUR LORD HIS ARROWS FORGE AND FILE POLISH
AND AT HIS FEET HIS BOW ALL READY LAY
AND WELL HIS DAUGHTER TEMPER'D ALL THE WHILE
THE HEADES IN THE WELL AND WITH HER WILE CLEVERNESS
SHE COUCH'D THEM AFTER AS THEY SHOULDE SERVE ARRANGED IN ORDER
SOME FOR TO SLAY AND SOME TO WOUND AND KERVE CARVE CUT
THEN WAS I WARE OF PLEASANCE ANON RIGHT
AND OF ARRAY AND LUST AND COURTESY
AND OF THE CRAFT THAT CAN AND HATH THE MIGHT
TO DO BY FORCE A WIGHT TO DO FOLLY MAKE
DISFIGURED WAS SHE I WILL NOT LIE DISGUISED
AND BY HIMSELF UNDER AN OAK I GUESS
SAW I DELIGHT THAT STOOD WITH GENTLENESS
THEN SAW I BEAUTY WITH A NICE ATTIRE
AND YOUTHE FULL OF GAME AND JOLLITY
FOOLHARDINESS FLATTERY AND DESIRE
MESSAGERIE AND MEED AND OTHER THREE 12
THEIR NAMES SHALL NOT HERE BE TOLD FOR ME
AND UPON PILLARS GREAT OF JASPER LONG
I SAW A TEMPLE OF BRASS Y FOUNDED STRONG
AND ALL ABOUT THE TEMPLE DANC'D ALWAY
WOMEN ENOUGH OF WHICHE SOME THERE WERE
FAIR OF THEMSELVES AND SOME OF THEM WERE GAY
IN KIRTLES ALL DISHEVELL'D WENT THEY THERE TUNICS
THAT WAS THEIR OFFICE EVER FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUTY OCCUPATION
AND ON THE TEMPLE SAW I WHITE AND FAIR
OF DOVES SITTING MANY A THOUSAND PAIR
13
BEFORE THE TEMPLE DOOR FULL SOBERLY
DAME PEACE SAT A CURTAIN IN HER HAND
AND HER BESIDE WONDER DISCREETELY
DAME PATIENCE SITTING THERE I FAND FOUND
WITH FACE PALE UPON A HILL OF SAND
AND ALTHERNEXT WITHIN AND EKE WITHOUT
BEHEST AND ART AND OF THEIR FOLK A ROUT PROMISE CROWD
WITHIN THE TEMPLE OF SIGHES HOT AS FIRE
I HEARD A SWOUGH THAT GAN ABOUTE REN MURMUR RUN
WHICH SIGHES WERE ENGENDER'D WITH DESIRE
THAT MADE EVERY HEARTE FOR TO BREN BURN
OF NEWE FLAME AND WELL ESPIED I THEN
THAT ALL THE CAUSE OF SORROWS THAT THEY DREE ENDURE
CAME OF THE BITTER GODDESS JEALOUSY
THE GOD PRIAPUS 14 SAW I AS I WENT
WITHIN THE TEMPLE IN SOV'REIGN PLACE STAND
IN SUCH ARRAY AS WHEN THE ASS HIM SHENT 15 RUINED
WITH CRY BY NIGHT AND WITH SCEPTRE IN HAND
FULL BUSILY MEN GAN ASSAY AND FAND ENDEAVOUR
UPON HIS HEAD TO SET OF SUNDRY HUE
GARLANDES FULL OF FRESHE FLOWERS NEW
AND IN A PRIVY CORNER IN DISPORT
FOUND I VENUS AND HER PORTER RICHESS
THAT WAS FULL NOBLE AND HAUTAIN OF HER PORT HAUGHTY 16
DARK WAS THAT PLACE BUT AFTERWARD LIGHTNESS
I SAW A LITTLE UNNETH IT MIGHT BE LESS SCARCELY
AND ON A BED OF GOLD SHE LAY TO REST
TILL THAT THE HOTE SUN BEGAN TO WEST DECLINE TOWARDS THE WESR
HER GILDED HAIRES WITH A GOLDEN THREAD
Y BOUNDEN WERE UNTRESSED AS SHE LAY LOOSE
AND NAKED FROM THE BREAST UNTO THE HEAD
MEN MIGHT HER SEE AND SOOTHLY FOR TO SAY
THE REMNANT COVER'D WELLE TO MY PAY SATISFACTION 17
RIGHT WITH A LITTLE KERCHIEF OF VALENCE 18
THERE WAS NO THICKER CLOTHE OF DEFENCE
THE PLACE GAVE A THOUSAND SAVOURS SWOOT SWEET
AND BACCHUS GOD OF WINE SAT HER BESIDE
AND CERES NEXT THAT DOTH OF HUNGER BOOT 19 RELIEVES HUNGER
AND AS I SAID AMIDDES LAY CYPRIDE 20 IN THE MIDST
TO WHOM ON KNEES THE YOUNGE FOLKE CRIED
TO BE THEIR HELP BUT THUS I LET HER LIE
AND FARTHER IN THE TEMPLE GAN ESPY
SEE NOTE 21 FOR THE STORIES OF THE LOVERS IN
THE NEXT TWO STANZAS
THAT IN DESPITE OF DIANA THE CHASTE
FULL MANY A BOWE BROKE HUNG ON THE WALL
OF MAIDENS SUCH AS GO THEIR TIME TO WASTE
IN HER SERVICE AND PAINTED OVER ALL
OF MANY A STORY OF WHICH I TOUCHE SHALL
A FEW AS OF CALIST' AND ATALANT'
AND MANY A MAID OF WHICH THE NAME I WANT DO NOT HAVE
SEMIRAMIS CANACE AND HERCULES
BIBLIS DIDO THISBE AND PYRAMUS
TRISTRAM ISOUDE PARIS AND ACHILLES
HELENA CLEOPATRA TROILUS
SCYLLA AND EKE THE MOTHER OF ROMULUS
ALL THESE WERE PAINTED ON THE OTHER SIDE
AND ALL THEIR LOVE AND IN WHAT PLIGHT THEY DIED
WHEN I WAS COME AGAIN INTO THE PLACE
THAT I OF SPAKE THAT WAS SO SWEET AND GREEN
FORTH WALK'D I THEN MYSELFE TO SOLACE
THEN WAS I WARE WHERE THERE SAT A QUEEN
THAT AS OF LIGHT THE SUMMER SUNNE SHEEN
PASSETH THE STAR RIGHT SO OVER MEASURE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION
SHE FAIRER WAS THAN ANY CREATURE
AND IN A LAWN UPON A HILL OF FLOWERS
WAS SET THIS NOBLE GODDESS OF NATURE
OF BRANCHES WERE HER HALLES AND HER BOWERS
Y WROUGHT AFTER HER CRAFT AND HER MEASURE
NOR WAS THERE FOWL THAT COMES OF ENGENDRURE
THAT THERE NE WERE PREST IN HER PRESENCE READY 22
TO TAKE HER DOOM AND GIVE HER AUDIENCE
RECEIVE HER DECISION
FOR THIS WAS ON SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY
WHEN EV'RY FOWL COMETH TO CHOOSE HER MAKE MATE
OF EVERY KIND THAT MEN THINKEN MAY
AND THEN SO HUGE A NOISE GAN THEY MAKE
THAT EARTH AND SEA AND TREE AND EV'RY LAKE
SO FULL WAS THAT UNNETHES THERE WAS SPACE SCARCELY
FOR ME TO STAND SO FULL WAS ALL THE PLACE
AND RIGHT AS ALAIN IN HIS PLAINT OF KIND 23
DEVISETH NATURE OF SUCH ARRAY AND FACE DESCRIBETH
IN SUCH ARRAY MEN MIGHTE HER THERE FIND
THIS NOBLE EMPERESS FULL OF ALL GRACE
BADE EV'RY FOWLE TAKE HER OWEN PLACE
AS THEY WERE WONT ALWAY FROM YEAR TO YEAR
ON SAINT VALENTINE'S DAY TO STANDE THERE
THAT IS TO SAY THE FOWLES OF RAVINE BIRDS OF PREY
WERE HIGHEST SET AND THEN THE FOWLES SMALE
THAT EATEN AS THEM NATURE WOULD INCLINE
AS WORME FOWL OF WHICH I TELL NO TALE
BUT WATERFOWL SAT LOWEST IN THE DALE
AND FOWLS THAT LIVE BY SEED SAT ON THE GREEN
AND THAT SO MANY THAT WONDER WAS TO SEE'N
THERE MIGHTE MEN THE ROYAL EAGLE FIND
THAT WITH HIS SHARPE LOOK PIERCETH THE SUN
AND OTHER EAGLES OF A LOWER KIND
OF WHICH THAT CLERKES WELL DEVISE CON WHICH SCHOLARS WELL
THERE WAS THE TYRANT WITH HIS FEATHERS DUN CAN DESCRIBE
AND GREEN I MEAN THE GOSHAWK THAT DOTH PINE CAUSE PAIN
TO BIRDS FOR HIS OUTRAGEOUS RAVINE SLAYING HUNTING
THE GENTLE FALCON THAT WITH HIS FEET DISTRAINETH GRASPS
THE KINGE'S HAND 24 THE HARDY SPERHAWK EKE PERT
THE QUAILE'S FOE THE MERLION 25 THAT PAINETH
HIMSELF FULL OFT THE LARKE FOR TO SEEK
THERE WAS THE DOVE WITH HER EYEN MEEK
THE JEALOUS SWAN AGAINST HIS DEATH THAT SINGETH IN ANTICIPATION OF
THE OWL EKE THAT OF DEATH THE BODE BRINGETH
OMEN
THE CRANE THE GIANT WITH HIS TRUMPET SOUN'
THE THIEF THE CHOUGH AND EKE THE CHATT'RING PIE
THE SCORNING JAY 26 THE EEL'S FOE THE HEROUN
THE FALSE LAPWING FULL OF TREACHERY 27
THE STARLING THAT THE COUNSEL CAN BETRAY
THE TAME RUDDOCK AND THE COWARD KITE ROBIN REDBREAST
THE COCK THAT HOROLOGE IS OF THORPES LITE CLOCK LITTLE VILLAGES
THE SPARROW VENUS' SON 28 THE NIGHTINGALE
THAT CALLETH FORTH THE FRESHE LEAVES NEW 29
THE SWALLOW MURD'RER OF THE BEES SMALE
THAT HONEY MAKE OF FLOWERS FRESH OF HUE
THE WEDDED TURTLE WITH HIS HEARTE TRUE
THE PEACOCK WITH HIS ANGEL FEATHERS BRIGHT 30
THE PHEASANT SCORNER OF THE COCK BY NIGHT 31
THE WAKER GOOSE 32 THE CUCKOO EVER UNKIND 33
THE POPINJAY FULL OF DELICACY PARROT
THE DRAKE DESTROYER OF HIS OWEN KIND 34
THE STORK THE WREAKER OF ADULTERY 35 AVENGER
THE HOT CORMORANT FULL OF GLUTTONY 36
THE RAVEN AND THE CROW WITH VOICE OF CARE 37
THE THROSTLE OLD AND THE FROSTY FIELDFARE 38 LONG LIVED
WHAT SHOULD I SAY OF FOWLS OF EV'RY KIND
THAT IN THIS WORLD HAVE FEATHERS AND STATURE
MEN MIGHTEN IN THAT PLACE ASSEMBLED FIND
BEFORE THAT NOBLE GODDESS OF NATURE
AND EACH OF THEM DID ALL HIS BUSY CURE CARE PAINS

WHO WELL LOVES LATE FORGETS THE REFRAIN OF THE ROUNDEL
INCULCATES THE DUTY OF CONSTANCY WHICH HAS BEEN IMPOSED ON

THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF IS PRE EMINENTLY ONE OF THOSE
POEMS BY WHICH CHAUCER MAY BE TRIUMPHANTLY DEFENDED AGAINST
THE CHARGE OF LICENTIOUS COARSENESS THAT FOUNDED UPON HIS
FAITHFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE MANNERS CUSTOMS AND DAILY LIFE
AND SPEECH OF HIS OWN TIME IN THE CANTERBURY TALES ARE
SWEEPINGLY ADVANCED AGAINST HIS WORKS AT LARGE
IN AN ALLEGORY
RENDERED PERHAPS SOMEWHAT CUMBROUS BY THE DETAIL OF CHIVALRIC
CEREMONIAL AND THE HERALDIC MINUTENESS WHICH ENTERED SO LIBERALLY
INTO POETRY AS INTO THE DAILY LIFE OF THE CLASSES FOR WHOM POETRY
WAS THEN WRITTEN CHAUCER BEAUTIFULLY ENFORCES THE LASTING
ADVANTAGES OF PURITY VALOUR AND FAITHFUL LOVE AND THE FLEETING
AND DISAPPOINTING CHARACTER OF MERE IDLE PLEASURE OF SLOTH
AND LISTLESS RETIREMENT FROM THE BATTLE OF LIFE
IN THE
SEASON SWEET OF SPRING WHICH THE GREAT SINGER OF MIDDLE AGE
ENGLAND LOVED SO WELL A GENTLE WOMAN IS SUPPOSED TO SEEK
SLEEP IN VAIN TO RISE ABOUT THE SPRINGING OF THE GLADSOME DAY
AND BY AN UNFREQUENTED PATH IN A PLEASANT GROVE TO ARRIVE AT AN
ARBOUR
BESIDE THE ARBOUR STANDS A MEDLAR TREE IN WHICH A
GOLDFINCH SINGS PASSING SWEETLY AND THE NIGHTINGALE ANSWERS
FROM A GREEN LAUREL TREE WITH SO MERRY AND RAVISHING A NOTE
THAT THE LADY RESOLVES TO PROCEED NO FARTHER BUT SIT DOWN ON THE
GRASS TO LISTEN
SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF MANY VOICES SINGING
SURPRISES HER AND SHE SEES A WORLD OF LADIES EMERGE FROM A
GROVE CLAD IN WHITE AND WEARING GARLANDS OF LAUREL OF AGNUS
CASTUS AND WOODBIND
ONE WHO WEARS A CROWN AND BEARS A
BRANCH OF AGNUS CASTUS IN HER HAND BEGINS A ROUNDEL IN HONOUR
OF THE LEAF WHICH ALL THE OTHERS TAKE UP DANCING AND SINGING IN
THE MEADOW BEFORE THE ARBOUR
SOON TO THE SOUND OF
THUNDERING TRUMPS AND ATTENDED BY A SPLENDID AND WARLIKE
RETINUE ENTER NINE KNIGHTS IN WHITE CROWNED LIKE THE LADIES
AND AFTER THEY HAVE JOUSTED AN HOUR AND MORE THEY ALIGHT AND
ADVANCE TO THE LADIES
EACH DAME TAKES A KNIGHT BY THE HAND
AND ALL INCLINE REVERENTLY TO THE LAUREL TREE WHICH THEY
ENCOMPASS SINGING OF LOVE AND DANCING
SOON PRECEDED BY A
BAND OF MINSTRELS OUT OF THE OPEN FIELD COMES A LUSTY COMPANY
OF KNIGHTS AND LADIES IN GREEN CROWNED WITH CHAPLETS OF
FLOWERS AND THEY DO REVERENCE TO A TUFT OF FLOWERS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE MEADOW WHILE ONE OF THEIR NUMBER SINGS A BERGERETTE IN
PRAISE OF THE DAISY
BUT NOW IT IS HIGH NOON THE SUN WAXES
FERVENTLY HOT THE FLOWERS LOSE THEIR BEAUTY AND WITHER WITH THE
HEAT THE LADIES IN GREEN ARE SCORCHED THE KNIGHTS FAINT FOR LACK
OF SHADE
THEN A STRONG WIND BEATS DOWN ALL THE FLOWERS SAVE
SUCH AS ARE PROTECTED BY THE LEAVES OF HEDGES AND GROVES AND A
MIGHTY STORM OF RAIN AND HAIL DRENCHES THE LADIES AND KNIGHTS
SHELTERLESS IN THE NOW FLOWERLESS MEADOW
THE STORM OVERPAST
THE COMPANY IN WHITE WHOM THE LAUREL TREE HAS SAFELY SHIELDED
FROM HEAT AND STORM ADVANCE TO THE RELIEF OF THE OTHERS AND
WHEN THEIR CLOTHES HAVE BEEN DRIED AND THEIR WOUNDS FROM SUN
AND STORM HEALED ALL GO TOGETHER TO SUP WITH THE QUEEN IN
WHITE ON WHOSE HAND AS THEY PASS BY THE ARBOUR THE
NIGHTINGALE PERCHES WHILE THE GOLDFINCH FLIES TO THE LADY OF THE
FLOWER
THE PAGEANT GONE THE GENTLEWOMAN QUITS THE ARBOUR
AND MEETS A LADY IN WHITE WHO AT HER REQUEST UNFOLDS THE
HIDDEN MEANING OF ALL THAT SHE HAS SEEN WHICH SAYS SPEGHT
QUAINTLY IS THIS THEY WHICH HONOUR THE FLOWER A THING FADING
WITH EVERY BLAST ARE SUCH AS LOOK AFTER BEAUTY AND WORLDLY
PLEASURE
BUT THEY THAT HONOUR THE LEAF WHICH ABIDETH WITH THE
ROOT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FROSTS AND WINTER STORMS ARE THEY
WHICH FOLLOW VIRTUE AND DURING QUALITIES WITHOUT REGARD OF
WORLDLY RESPECTS MR BELL IN HIS EDITION HAS PROPERLY NOTICED
THAT THERE IS NO EXPLANATION OF THE EMBLEMATICAL IMPORT OF THE
MEDLAR TREE THE GOLDFINCH AND THE NIGHTINGALE
BUT HE SAYS
AS THE FRUIT OF THE MEDLAR TO USE CHAUCER'S OWN EXPRESSION SEE
PROLOGUE TO THE REEVE'S TALE IS ROTTEN BEFORE IT IS RIPE IT MAY
BE THE EMBLEM OF SENSUAL PLEASURE WHICH PALLS BEFORE IT CONFERS
REAL ENJOYMENT
THE GOLDFINCH IS REMARKABLE FOR THE BEAUTY OF ITS
PLUMAGE THE SPRIGHTLINESS OF ITS MOVEMENTS AND ITS GAY
TINKLING SONG AND MAY BE SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE SHOWY AND
UNSUBSTANTIAL CHARACTER OF FRIVOLOUS PLEASURES
THE NIGHTINGALE'S
SOBER OUTWARD APPEARANCE AND IMPASSIONED SONG DENOTE GREATER
DEPTH OF FEELING THE POEM THROUGHOUT IS MARKED BY THE PUREST
AND LOFTIEST MORAL TONE AND IT AMPLY DESERVED DRYDEN'S SPECIAL
RECOMMENDATION BOTH FOR THE INVENTION AND THE MORAL IT IS
GIVEN WITHOUT ABRIDGEMENT
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE MODERN SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT CHAUCER WAS
NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS POEM
WHEN THAT PHOEBUS HIS CAR OF GOLD SO HIGH
HAD WHIRLED UP THE STARRY SKY ALOFT
AND IN THE BULL 1 ENTER'D CERTAINLY
WHEN SHOWERS SWEET OF RAIN DESCENDED SOFT
CAUSING THE GROUNDE FELE TIMES AND OFT MANY
UP FOR TO GIVE MANY A WHOLESOME AIR
AND EVERY PLAIN WAS Y CLOTHED FAIR
WITH NEWE GREEN AND MAKETH SMALLE FLOW'RS
TO SPRINGE HERE AND THERE IN FIELD AND MEAD
SO VERY GOOD AND WHOLESOME BE THE SHOW'RS
THAT THEY RENEWE WHAT WAS OLD AND DEAD
IN WINTER TIME AND OUT OF EV'RY SEED
SPRINGETH THE HERBE SO THAT EV'RY WIGHT
OF THILKE SEASON WAXETH GLAD AND LIGHT
THIS
AND I SO GLAD OF THILKE SEASON SWEET
WAS HAPPED THUS UPON A CERTAIN NIGHT THUS CIRCUMSTANCED
AS I LAY IN MY BED SLEEP FULL UNMEET UNFIT UNCOMPLIANT
WAS UNTO ME BUT WHY THAT I NOT MIGHT
REST I NOT WIST FOR THERE N'AS EARTHLY WIGHT WAS NOT
AS I SUPPOSE HAD MORE HEARTE'S EASE
THAN I FOR I N'HAD SICKNESS NOR DISEASE HAD NOT DISTRESS
WHEREFORE I MARVEL GREATLY OF MYSELF
THAT I SO LONG WITHOUTE SLEEPE LAY
AND UP I ROSE THREE HOURES AFTER TWELF
ABOUT THE SPRINGING OF THE GLADSOME DAY
AND ON I PUT MY GEAR AND MINE ARRAY GARMENTS
AND TO A PLEASANT GROVE I GAN TO PASS
LONG ERE THE BRIGHTE SUN UPRISEN WAS
IN WHICH WERE OAKES GREAT STRAIGHT AS A LINE
UNDER THE WHICH THE GRASS SO FRESH OF HUE
WAS NEWLY SPRUNG AND AN EIGHT FOOT OR NINE
EVERY TREE WELL FROM HIS FELLOW GREW
WITH BRANCHES BROAD LADEN WITH LEAVES NEW
THAT SPRANGEN OUT AGAINST THE SUNNE SHEEN
SOME VERY RED 2 AND SOME A GLAD LIGHT GREEN
WHICH AS ME THOUGHT WAS RIGHT A PLEASANT SIGHT
AND EKE THE BIRDES' SONGES FOR TO HEAR
WOULD HAVE REJOICED ANY EARTHLY WIGHT
AND I THAT COULD NOT YET IN NO MANNERE
HEARE THE NIGHTINGALE OF ALL THE YEAR 3 DURING
FULL BUSY HEARKENED WITH HEART AND EAR
IF I HER VOICE PERCEIVE COULD ANYWHERE
AND AT THE LAST A PATH OF LITTLE BREDE BREADTH
I FOUND THAT GREATLY HAD NOT USED BE
FOR IT FORGROWEN WAS WITH GRASS AND WEED OVERGROWN
THAT WELL UNNETH A WIGHT MIGHTE SEE SCARCELY
THOUGHT I THIS PATH SOME WHITHER GOES PARDIE OF A SURETY
AND SO I FOLLOW'D IT TILL IT ME BROUGHT
TO A RIGHT PLEASANT ARBOUR WELL Y WROUGHT
THAT BENCHED WAS AND ALL WITH TURFES NEW
FRESHLY Y TURF'D 4 WHEREOF THE GREENE GRASS
SO SMALL SO THICK SO SHORT SO FRESH OF HUE
THAT MOST LIKE TO GREEN WOOL I WOT IT WAS
THE HEDGE ALSO THAT YEDEN IN COMPASS WENT ALL AROUND 5
AND CLOSED IN ALL THE GREENE HERBERE ARBOUR
WITH SYCAMORE WAS SET AND EGLATERE EGLANTINE SWEET BRIAR
WREATHED IN FERE SO WELL AND CUNNINGLY TOGETHER
THAT EV'RY BRANCH AND LEAF GREW BY MEASURE REGULARLY
PLAIN AS A BOARD OF A HEIGHT BY AND BY THE SAME HEIGHT SIDE
I SAW NEVER A THING I YOU ENSURE BY SIDE
SO WELL Y DONE FOR HE THAT TOOK THE CURE PAINS CARE
TO MAKEN IT I TROW DID ALL HIS PAIN
TO MAKE IT PASS ALL THOSE THAT MEN HAVE SEEN
AND SHAPEN WAS THIS ARBOUR ROOF AND ALL
AS IS A PRETTY PARLOUR AND ALSO
THE HEDGE AS THICK WAS AS A CASTLE WALL
THAT WHOSO LIST WITHOUT TO STAND OR GO
THOUGH HE WOULD ALL DAY PRYEN TO AND FRO
HE SHOULD NOT SEE IF THERE WERE ANY WIGHT
WITHIN OR NO BUT ONE WITHIN WELL MIGHT
PERCEIVE ALL THOSE THAT WENTE THERE WITHOUT
INTO THE FIELD THAT WAS ON EV'RY SIDE
COVER'D WITH CORN AND GRASS THAT OUT OF DOUBT
THOUGH ONE WOULD SEEKEN ALL THE WORLDE WIDE
SO RICH A FIELDE COULD NOT BE ESPIED
UPON NO COAST AS OF THE QUANTITY FOR ITS ABUNDANCE
FOR OF ALL GOODE THING THERE WAS PLENTY
OR FERTILITY
AND I THAT ALL THIS PLEASANT SIGHT DID SEE
THOUGHT SUDDENLY I FELT SO SWEET AN AIR
OF THE EGLENTERE THAT CERTAINLY
THERE IS NO HEART I DEEM IN SUCH DESPAIR
NOR YET WITH THOUGHTES FROWARD AND CONTRAIR
SO OVERLAID BUT IT SHOULD SOON HAVE BOOT REMEDY RELIEF
IF IT HAD ONES FELT THIS SAVOUR SWOOT SWEET SMELL
AND AS I STOOD AND CAST ASIDE MINE EYE
I WAS WARE OF THE FAIREST MEDLAR TREE
THAT EVER YET IN ALL MY LIFE I SEYE SAW
AS FULL OF BLOSSOMS AS IT MIGHTE BE
THEREIN A GOLDFINCH LEAPING PRETTILY
FROM BOUGH TO BOUGH AND AS HIM LIST HE EAT
HERE AND THERE OF THE BUDS AND FLOWERS SWEET
AND TO THE ARBOUR SIDE WAS ADJOINING
THIS FAIREST TREE OF WHICH I HAVE YOU TOLD
AND AT THE LAST THE BIRD BEGAN TO SING
WHEN HE HAD EATEN WHAT HE EATE WO'LD
SO PASSING SWEETLY THAT BY MANY FOLD
IT WAS MORE PLEASANT THAN I COULD DEVISE TELL DESCRIBE
AND WHEN HIS SONG WAS ENDED IN THIS WISE
THE NIGHTINGALE WITH SO MERRY A NOTE
ANSWERED HIM THAT ALL THE WOODE RUNG
SO SUDDENLY THAT AS IT WERE A SOTE LIKE A FOOL 6
I STOOD ASTOUND' SO WAS I WITH THE SONG
THOROUGH RAVISHED THAT TILL LATE AND LONG FOR A LONG TIME
I WIST NOT IN WHAT PLACE I WAS NOR WHERE
AGAIN ME THOUGHT SHE SUNG E'EN BY MINE EAR
WHEREFORE I WAITED ABOUT BUSILY
ON EV'RY SIDE IF THAT I MIGHT HER SEE
AND AT THE LAST I GAN FULL WELL ESPY
WHERE SHE SAT IN A FRESH GREEN LAUREL TREE
ON THE FURTHER SIDE EVEN RIGHT BY ME
THAT GAVE SO PASSING A DELICIOUS SMELL
ACCORDING TO THE EGLANTERE FULL WELL
BLENDING WITH
WHEREOF I HAD SO INLY GREAT PLEASURE
THAT AS ME THOUGHT I SURELY RAVISH'D WAS
INTO PARADISE WHERE AS MY DESIRE
WAS FOR TO BE AND NO FARTHER TO PASS
AS FOR THAT DAY AND ON THE SWEETE GRASS
I SAT ME DOWN FOR AS FOR MINE INTENT TO MY MIND
THE BIRDE'S SONG WAS MORE CONVENIENT APPROPRIATE TO MY HUMOUR
AND MORE PLEASANT TO ME BY MANY FOLD
THAN MEAT OR DRINK OR ANY OTHER THING
THERETO THE ARBOUR WAS SO FRESH AND COLD
THE WHOLESOME SAVOURS EKE SO COMFORTING
THAT AS I DEEMED SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE WORLD WAS THERE NEVER SEEN ERE THAN BEFORE THEN
SO PLEASANT A GROUND OF NONE EARTHLY MAN
AND AS I SAT THE BIRDES HEARK'NING THUS
ME THOUGHT THAT I HEARD VOICES SUDDENLY
THE MOST SWEETEST AND MOST DELICIOUS
THAT EVER ANY WIGHT I TROW TRUELY VERILY BELIEVE
HEARD IN THEIR LIFE FOR THE HARMONY
AND SWEET ACCORD WAS IN SO GOOD MUSIKE
THAT THE VOICES TO ANGELS' MOST WERE LIKE
AT THE LAST OUT OF A GROVE EVEN BY
THAT WAS RIGHT GOODLY AND PLEASANT TO SIGHT
I SAW WHERE THERE CAME SINGING LUSTILY
A WORLD OF LADIES BUT TO TELL ARIGHT
THEIR GREATE BEAUTY LIES NOT IN MY MIGHT
NOR THEIR ARRAY NEVERTHELESS I SHALL
TELL YOU A PART THOUGH I SPEAK NOT OF ALL
IN SURCOATS WHITE OF VELVET WELL FITTING UPPER ROBES
THEY WERE CLAD AND THE SEAMES EACH ONE
AS IT WERE A MANNERE OF GARNISHING
WAS SET WITH EMERALDES ONE AND ONE
BY AND BY BUT MANY A RICHE STONE IN A ROW

HAD CHAPELETS OF WOODBINE AND SADLY SEDATELY
SOME OF AGNUS CASTUS 8 WEAREN ALSO
CHAPELETS FRESH BUT THERE WERE MANY OF THO' THOSE
THAT DANCED AND EKE SUNG FULL SOBERLY

BUT ONE THERE WENT IN MID THE COMPANY
SOLE BY HERSELF BUT ALL FOLLOW'D THE PACE

THAT ME THOUGHT IT THE SWEETEST MELODY
THAT EVER I HEARD IN MY LIFE SOOTHLY TRULY
AND THUS THEY CAME DANCING AND SINGING
INTO THE MIDDEST OF THE MEAD EACH ONE

AND SO THEY CAME THEIR HORSES FRESH STIRRING
WITH BLOODY SOUNDES OF THEIR TRUMPETS LOUD
THERE SAW I MANY AN UNCOUTH DISGUISING STRANGE MANOEUVRING
IN THE ARRAY OF THESE KNIGHTES PROUD
AND AT THE LAST AS EVENLY AS THEY COULD
THEY TOOK THEIR PLACE IN MIDDEST OF THE MEAD
AND EV'RY KNIGHT TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD
TO HIS FELLOW AND LIGHTLY LAID A SPEAR
INTO THE REST AND SO THE JOUSTS BEGAN
ON EV'RY PART ABOUTE HERE AND THERE
SOME BRAKE HIS SPEAR SOME THREW DOWN HORSE AND MAN
ABOUT THE FIELD ASTRAY THE STEEDES RAN
AND TO BEHOLD THEIR RULE AND GOVERNANCE CONDUCT
I YOU ENSURE IT WAS A GREAT PLEASUANCE
AND SO THE JOUSTES LAST' AN HOUR AND MORE LASTED
BUT THOSE THAT CROWNED WERE IN LAUREL GREEN
WONNE THE PRIZE THEIR DINTES WERE SO SORE STROKES
THAT THERE WAS NONE AGAINST THEM MIGHT SUSTENE
AND THE JOUSTING WAS ALLE LEFT OFF CLEAN
AND FROM THEIR HORSE THE NINE ALIGHT' ANON
AND SO DID ALL THE REMNANT EV'RY ONE
AND FORTH THEY WENT TOGETHER TWAIN AND TWAIN
THAT TO BEHOLD IT WAS A WORTHY SIGHT
TOWARD THE LADIES ON THE GREENE PLAIN
THAT SANG AND DANCED AS I SAID NOW RIGHT
THE LADIES AS SOON AS THEY GOODLY MIGHT
THEY BRAKE OFF BOTH THE SONG AND EKE THE DANCE
AND WENT TO MEET THEM WITH FULL GLAD SEMBLANCE AIR ASPECT
AND EV'RY LADY TOOK FULL WOMANLY
BY TH'HAND A KNIGHT AND SO FORTH RIGHT THEY YEDE WENT
UNTO A FAIR LAUREL THAT STOOD FAST BY
WITH LEAVES LADE THE BOUGHS OF GREATE BREDE BREADTH
AND TO MY DOOM THERE NEVER WAS INDEED JUDGMENT
MAN THAT HAD SEENE HALF SO FAIR A TREE
FOR UNDERNEATH IT THERE MIGHT WELL HAVE BE BEEN
A HUNDRED PERSONS AT THEIR OWN PLEASANCE IN PERFECT COMFORT
SHADOWED FROM THE HEAT OF PHOEBUS BRIGHT
SO THAT THEY SHOULDE HAVE FELT NO GRIEVANCE ANNOYANCE
OF RAIN NOR HAILE THAT THEM HURTE MIGHT
THE SAVOUR EKE REJOICE WOULD ANY WIGHT
THAT HAD BEEN SICK OR MELANCHOLIOUS
IT WAS SO VERY GOOD AND VIRTUOUS FULL OF HEALING VIRTUES
AND WITH GREAT REV'RENCE THEY INCLINED LOW
UNTO THE TREE SO SWEET AND FAIR OF HUE APPEARANCE
AND AFTER THAT WITHIN A LITTLE THROW SHORT TIME
THEY ALL BEGAN TO SING AND DANCE OF NEW
SOME SONG OF LOVE SOME PLAINING OF UNTRUE COMPLAINT OF
ENVIRONING THE TREE THAT STOOD UPRIGHT UNFAITHFULNESS
AND EVER WENT A LADY AND A KNIGHT
GOING ROUND
AND AT THE LAST I CAST MINE EYE ASIDE
AND WAS WARE OF A LUSTY COMPANY
THAT CAME ROAMING OUT OF THE FIELDE WIDE
AND HAND IN HAND A KNIGHT AND A LADY
THE LADIES ALL IN SURCOATS THAT RICHLY
PURFILED WERE WITH MANY A RICHE STONE TRIMMED AT THE BORDERS
AND EV'RY KNIGHT OF GREEN WARE MANTLES ON
EMBROIDER'D WELL SO AS THE SURCOATS WERE
AND EV'REACH HAD A CHAPLET ON HER HEAD
WHICH DID RIGHT WELL UPON THE SHINING HAIR
MAKED OF GOODLY FLOWERS WHITE AND RED
THE KNIGHTES EKE THAT THEY IN HANDE LED
IN SUIT OF THEM WARE CHAPLETS EV'RY ONE
AND THEM BEFORE WENT MINSTRELS MANY ONE
AS HARPES PIPES LUTES AND PSALTRY
ALL CLAD IN GREEN AND ON THEIR HEADES BARE
OF DIVERS FLOWERS MADE FULL CRAFTILY
ALL IN A SUIT GOODLY CHAPLETS THEY WARE
AND SO DANCING INTO THE MEAD THEY FARE
IN MID THE WHICH THEY FOUND A TUFT THAT WAS
ALL OVERSPREAD WITH FLOWERS IN COMPASS AROUND IN A CIRCLE
WHEREUNTO THEY INCLINED EV'RY ONE
WITH GREAT REVERENCE AND THAT FULL HUMBLY
AND AT THE LAST THERE THEN BEGAN ANON
A LADY FOR TO SING RIGHT WOMANLY
A BARGARET 14 IN PRAISING THE DAISY
FOR AS ME THOUGHT AMONG HER NOTES SWEET
SHE SAIDE SI DOUCE EST LA MARGARETE 15
THEN ALLE THEY ANSWERED HER IN FERE TOGETHER
SO PASSINGLY WELL AND SO PLEASANTLY
THAT IT WAS A MOST BLISSFUL NOISE TO HEAR
BUT I N'OT HOW IT HAPPEN'D SUDDENLY KNOW NOT
AS ABOUT NOON THE SUN SO FERVENTLY
WAX'D HOTE THAT THE PRETTY TENDER FLOW'RS
HAD LOST THE BEAUTY OF THEIR FRESH COLOURS
FORSHRUNK WITH HEAT THE LADIES EKE TO BRENT SHRIVELLED VERY BURNT
THAT THEY KNEW NOT WHERE THEY MIGHT THEM BESTOW
THE KNIGHTES SWELT FOR LACK OF SHADE NIGH SHENT FAINTED DESTROYED
AND AFTER THAT WITHIN A LITTLE THROW
THE WIND BEGAN SO STURDILY TO BLOW
THAT DOWN WENT ALL THE FLOWERS EV'RY ONE
SO THAT IN ALL THE MEAD THERE LEFT NOT ONE
SAVE SUCH AS SUCCOUR'D WERE AMONG THE LEAVES
FROM EV'RY STORM THAT MIGHTE THEM ASSAIL
GROWING UNDER THE HEDGES AND THICK GREVES GROVES BOUGHS
AND AFTER THAT THERE CAME A STORM OF HAIL
AND RAIN IN FERE SO THAT WITHOUTE FAIL TOGETHER
THE LADIES NOR THE KNIGHTS HAD NOT ONE THREAD
DRY ON THEM SO DROPPING WAS ALL THEIR WEED CLOTHING
AND WHEN THE STORM WAS PASSED CLEAN AWAY
THOSE IN THE WHITE THAT STOOD UNDER THE TREE
THEY FELT NO THING OF ALL THE GREAT AFFRAY
THAT THEY IN GREEN WITHOUT HAD IN Y BE HAD BEEN IN
TO THEM THEY WENT FOR RUTH AND FOR PITY
THEM TO COMFORT AFTER THEIR GREAT DISEASE TROUBLE
SO FAIN THEY WERE THE HELPLESS FOR TO EASE
GLAD EAGER
THEN I WAS WARE HOW ONE OF THEM IN GREEN
HAD ON A CROWNE RICH AND WELL SITTING BECOMING
WHEREFORE I DEEMED WELL SHE WAS A QUEEN
AND THOSE IN GREEN ON HER WERE AWAITING IN ATTENDANCE
THE LADIES THEN IN WHITE THAT WERE COMING
TOWARD THEM AND THE KNIGHTES EKE IN FERE TOGETHER
BEGAN TO COMFORT THEM AND MAKE THEM CHEER
THE QUEEN IN WHITE THAT WAS OF GREAT BEAUTY
TOOK BY THE HAND THE QUEEN THAT WAS IN GREEN
AND SAIDE SISTER I HAVE GREAT PITY
OF YOUR ANNOY AND OF YOUR TROUBLOUS TEEN INJURY GRIEF
WHEREIN YOU AND YOUR COMPANY HAVE BEEN
SO LONG ALAS AND IF THAT IT YOU PLEASE
TO GO WITH ME I SHALL YOU DO THE EASE
IN ALL THE PLEASURE THAT I CAN OR MAY
WHEREOF THE OTHER HUMBLY AS SHE MIGHT
THANKED HER FOR IN RIGHT EVIL ARRAY
SHE WAS WITH STORM AND HEAT I YOU BEHIGHT ASSURE
ARID EV'RY LADY THEN ANON ARIGHT
THAT WERE IN WHITE ONE OF THEM TOOK IN GREEN
BY THE HAND WHICH WHEN THAT THE KNIGHTS HAD SEEN
IN LIKE MANNERE EACH OF THEM TOOK A KNIGHT
Y CLAD IN GREEN AND FORTH WITH THEM THEY FARE
UNTO A HEDGE WHERE THAT THEY ANON RIGHT
TO MAKE THEIR JOUSTES 16 THEY WOULD NOT SPARE
BOUGHES TO HEWE DOWN AND EKE TREES SQUARE
WHEREWITH THEY MADE THEM STATELY FIRES GREAT
TO DRY THEIR CLOTHES THAT WERE WRINGING WET
AND AFTER THAT OF HERBES THAT THERE GREW
THEY MADE FOR BLISTERS OF THE SUN'S BURNING
OINTMENTES VERY GOOD WHOLESOME AND NEW
WHEREWITH THEY WENT THE SICK FAST ANOINTING
AND AFTER THAT THEY WENT ABOUT GATH'RING
PLEASANT SALADES WHICH THEY MADE THEM EAT
FOR TO REFRESH THEIR GREAT UNKINDLY HEAT
THE LADY OF THE LEAF THEN GAN TO PRAY
HER OF THE FLOWER FOR SO TO MY SEEMING
THEY SHOULD BE CALLED AS BY THEIR ARRAY
TO SUP WITH HER AND EKE FOR ANYTHING
THAT SHE SHOULD WITH HER ALL HER PEOPLE BRING
AND SHE AGAIN IN RIGHT GOODLY MANNERE
THANKED HER FAST OF HER MOST FRIENDLY CHEER
SAYING PLAINELY THAT SHE WOULD OBEY
WITH ALL HER HEART ALL HER COMMANDEMENT
AND THEN ANON WITHOUT LONGER DELAY
THE LADY OF THE LEAF HATH ONE Y SENT
TO BRING A PALFREY AFTER HER INTENT ACCORDING TO HER WISH
ARRAYED WELL IN FAIR HARNESS OF GOLD
FOR NOTHING LACK'D THAT TO HIM LONGE SHO'LD SHOULD BELONG TO HIM
AND AFTER THAT TO ALL HER COMPANY
SHE MADE TO PURVEY HORSE AND EV'RYTHING PROVIDE
THAT THEY NEEDED AND THEN FULL LUSTILY
EV'N BY THE ARBOUR WHERE I WAS SITTING
THEY PASSED ALL SO MERRILY SINGING
THAT IT WOULD HAVE COMFORTED ANY WIGHT
BUT THEN I SAW A PASSING WONDROUS SIGHT
FOR THEN THE NIGHTINGALE THAT ALL THE DAY
HAD IN THE LAUREL SAT AND DID HER MIGHT
THE WHOLE SERVICE TO SING LONGING TO MAY
ALL SUDDENLY BEGAN TO TAKE HER FLIGHT
AND TO THE LADY OF THE LEAF FORTHRIGHT
SHE FLEW AND SET HER ON HER HAND SOFTLY
WHICH WAS A THING I MARVELL'D AT GREATLY
THE GOLDFINCH EKE THAT FROM THE MEDLAR TREE
WAS FLED FOR HEAT INTO THE BUSHES COLD
UNTO THE LADY OF THE FLOWER GAN FLEE
AND ON HER HAND HE SET HIM AS HE WO'LD
AND PLEASANTLY HIS WINGES GAN TO FOLD
AND FOR TO SING THEY PAIN'D THEM BOTH AS SORE MADE GREAT EXERTIONS
AS THEY HAD DONE OF ALL THE DAY BEFORE
DURING
AND SO THESE LADIES RODE FORTH A GREAT PACE RAPIDLY
AND ALL THE ROUT OF KNIGHTES EKE IN FERE
AND I THAT HAD SEEN ALL THIS WONDER CASE WONDROUS INCIDENT
THOUGHT THAT I WOULD ASSAY IN SOME MANNERE
TO KNOW FULLY THE TRUTH OF THIS MATTERE
AND WHAT THEY WERE THAT RODE SO PLEASANTLY
AND WHEN THEY WERE THE ARBOUR PASSED BY
I DRESS'D ME FORTH AND HAPP'D TO MEET ANON ISSUED FORTH
A RIGHT FAIR LADY I DO YOU ENSURE ASSURE
AND SHE CAME RIDING BY HERSELF ALONE
ALL IN WHITE THEN WITH SEMBLANCE FULL DEMURE
I HER SALUTED AND BADE GOOD ADVENTURE FORTUNE
MIGHT HER BEFALL AS I COULD MOST HUMBLY
AND SHE ANSWER'D MY DAUGHTER GRAMERCY GREAT THANKS 17
MADAME QUOTH I IF THAT I DURST ENQUERE
OF YOU I WOULD FAIN OF THAT COMPANY
WIT WHAT THEY BE THAT PASS'D BY THIS HERBERE
AND SHE AGAIN ANSWERED RIGHT FRIENDLY
MY FAIRE DAUGHTER ALL THAT PASS'D HEREBY

UNTO THE LEAF AND I MYSELF AM ONE
SEE YE NOT HER THAT CROWNED IS QUOTH SHE
CLAD ALL IN WHITE MADAME THEN QUOTH I YES
THAT IS DIAN' GODDESS OF CHASTITY
AND FOR BECAUSE THAT SHE A MAIDEN IS
IN HER HANDE THE BRANCH SHE BEARETH THIS
THAT AGNUS CASTUS 8 MEN CALL PROPERLY
AND ALL THE LADIES IN HER COMPANY
WHICH YE SEE OF THAT HERBE CHAPLETS WEAR
BE SUCH AS HAVE KEPT ALWAY MAIDENHEAD
AND ALL THEY THAT OF LAUREL CHAPLETS BEAR
BE SUCH AS HARDY WERE IN MANLY DEED COURAGEOUS
VICTORIOUS NAME WHICH NEVER MAY BE DEAD
AND ALL THEY WERE SO WORTHY OF THEIR HAND VALIANT IN FIGHT
IN THEIR TIME THAT NO ONE MIGHT THEM WITHSTAND
AND THOSE THAT WEARE CHAPLETS ON THEIR HEAD
OF FRESH WOODBIND BE SUCH AS NEVER WERE
TO LOVE UNTRUE IN WORD IN THOUGHT NOR DEED
BUT AY STEADFAST NOR FOR PLEASANCE NOR FEAR
THOUGH THAT THEY SHOULD THEIR HEARTES ALL TO TEAR REND IN PIECES
WOULD NEVER FLIT BUT EVER WERE STEADFAST CHANGE
TILL THAT THEIR LIVES THERE ASUNDER BRAST TILL THEY DIED
NOW FAIR MADAME QUOTH I YET WOULD I PRAY
YOUR LADYSHIP IF THAT IT MIGHTE BE
THAT I MIGHT KNOWE BY SOME MANNER WAY
SINCE THAT IT HATH LIKED YOUR BEAUTY
THE TRUTH OF THESE LADIES FOR TO TELL ME
WHAT THAT THESE KNIGHTES BE IN RICH ARMOUR
AND WHAT THOSE BE IN GREEN AND WEAR THE FLOW'R
AND WHY THAT SOME DID REV'RENCE TO THAT TREE
AND SOME UNTO THE PLOT OF FLOWERS FAIR
WITH RIGHT GOOD WILL MY DAUGHTER FAIR QUOTH SHE
SINCE YOUR DESIRE IS GOOD AND DEBONAIR GENTLE COURTEOUS
THE NINE CROWNED BE VERY EXEMPLAIR THE TRUE EXAMPLES
OF ALL HONOUR LONGING TO CHIVALRY
AND THOSE CERTAIN BE CALL'D THE NINE WORTHY 18
WHICH YE MAY SEE NOW RIDING ALL BEFORE
THAT IN THEIR TIME DID MANY A NOBLE DEED
AND FOR THEIR WORTHINESS FULL OFT HAVE BORE
THE CROWN OF LAUREL LEAVES UPON THEIR HEAD
AS YE MAY IN YOUR OLDE BOOKES READ
AND HOW THAT HE THAT WAS A CONQUEROUR
HAD BY LAUREL ALWAY HIS MOST HONOUR
AND THOSE THAT BEARE BOUGHES IN THEIR HAND
OF THE PRECIOUS LAUREL SO NOTABLE
BE SUCH AS WERE I WILL YE UNDERSTAND
MOST NOBLE KNIGHTES OF THE ROUNDE TABLE 19
AND EKE THE DOUCEPERES HONOURABLE 20
WHICHE THEY BEAR IN SIGN OF VICTORY
AS WITNESS OF THEIR DEEDES MIGHTILY
EKE THERE BE KNIGHTES OLD 21 OF THE GARTER
THAT IN THEIR TIME DID RIGHT WORTHILY
AND THE HONOUR THEY DID TO THE LAURER LAUREL 22
IS FOR BY IT THEY HAVE THEIR LAUD WHOLLY BECAUSE
THEIR TRIUMPH EKE AND MARTIAL GLORY
WHICH UNTO THEM IS MORE PERFECT RICHESS
THAN ANY WIGHT IMAGINE CAN OR GUESS
FOR ONE LEAF GIVEN OF THAT NOBLE TREE
TO ANY WIGHT THAT HATH DONE WORTHILY
AN' IT BE DONE SO AS IT OUGHT TO BE IF
IS MORE HONOUR THAN ANY THING EARTHLY
WITNESS OF ROME THAT FOUNDER WAS TRULY
OF ALLE KNIGHTHOOD AND DEEDS MARVELLOUS
RECORD I TAKE OF TITUS LIVIUS 23
AND AS FOR HER THAT CROWNED IS IN GREEN
IT IS FLORA OF THESE FLOWERS GODDESS
AND ALL THAT HERE ON HER AWAITING BE'N
IT ARE SUCH FOLK THAT LOVED IDLENESS
AND NOT DELIGHTED IN NO BUSINESS
BUT FOR TO HUNT AND HAWK AND PLAY IN MEADS
AND MANY OTHER SUCH LIKE IDLE DEEDS
AND FOR THE GREAT DELIGHT AND THE PLEASANCE
THEY HAVE TO THE FLOW'R AND SO REV'RENTLY
THEY UNTO IT DO SUCH OBEISANCE
AS YE MAY SEE NOW FAIR MADAME QUOTH I
IF I DURST ASK WHAT IS THE CAUSE AND WHY
THAT KNIGHTES HAVE THE ENSIGN OF HONOUR INSIGNIA
RATHER BY THE LEAF THAN BY THE FLOW'R
SOOTHLY DAUGHTER QUOTH SHE THIS IS THE TROTH
FOR KNIGHTS SHOULD EVER BE PERSEVERING
TO SEEK HONOUR WITHOUT FEINTISE OR SLOTH DISSIMULATION
FROM WELL TO BETTER IN ALL MANNER THING
IN SIGN OF WHICH WITH LEAVES AYE LASTING
THEY BE REWARDED AFTER THEIR DEGREE
WHOSE LUSTY GREEN MAY NOT APPAIRED BE IMPAIRED DECAYED
BUT AY KEEPING THEIR BEAUTY FRESH AND GREEN
FOR THERE IS NO STORM THAT MAY THEM DEFACE
NOR HAIL NOR SNOW NOR WIND NOR FROSTES KEEN
WHEREFORE THEY HAVE THIS PROPERTY AND GRACE
AND FOR THE FLOW'R WITHIN A LITTLE SPACE
WOLLE BE LOST SO SIMPLE OF NATURE WILL
THEY BE THAT THEY NO GRIEVANCE MAY ENDURE INJURY HARDSHIP
AND EV'RY STORM WILL BLOW THEM SOON AWAY
NOR THEY LASTE NOT BUT FOR A SEASON
THAT IS THE CAUSE THE VERY TRUTH TO SAY
THAT THEY MAY NOT BY NO WAY OF REASON
BE PUT TO NO SUCH OCCUPATION
MADAME QUOTH I WITH ALL MY WHOLE SERVICE
I THANK YOU NOW IN MY MOST HUMBLE WISE
FOR NOW I AM ASCERTAIN'D THOROUGHLY
OF EV'RY THING THAT I DESIR'D TO KNOW
I AM RIGHT GLAD THAT I HAVE SAID SOOTHLY

AND KEEP YOU FROM THE WICKED REMEMBRANCE
OF MALEBOUCHE AND ALL HIS CRUELTY SLANDER 24
AND ALL THAT GOOD AND WELL CONDITION'D BE

I MUST FOLLOW THE GREATE COMPANY
THAT YE MAY SEE YONDER BEFORE YOU RIDE
AND FORTHWITH AS I COULDE MOST HUMBLY
I TOOK MY LEAVE OF HER AND SHE GAN HIE HASTE
AFTER THEM AS FAST AS SHE EVER MIGHT

IN PRESS INTO A CROWD INTO THE PRESS OF
COMPETITORS FOR FAVOUR NOT IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID
INTO THE PRESS IN THE MODERN SENSE PRINTING WAS
NOT INVENTED FOR A CENTURY AFTER THIS WAS WRITTEN
THE HOUSE OF FAME
THANKS PARTLY TO POPE'S BRIEF AND ELEGANT PARAPHRASE IN HIS
TEMPLE OF FAME AND PARTLY TO THE FAMILIAR FORCE OF THE STYLE
AND THE SATIRICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ALLEGORY THE HOUSE OF
FAME IS AMONG THE BEST KNOWN AND RELISHED OF CHAUCER'S MINOR
POEMS
THE OCTOSYLLABIC MEASURE IN WHICH IT IS WRITTEN THE
SAME WHICH THE AUTHOR OF HUDIBRAS USED WITH SUCH ADMIRABLE
EFFECT IS EXCELLENTLY ADAPTED FOR THE VIVID DESCRIPTIONS THE
LIVELY SALLIES OF HUMOUR AND SARCASM WITH WHICH THE POEM
ABOUNDS AND WHEN THE POET ACTUALLY DOES GET TO HIS SUBJECT HE
TREATS IT WITH A ZEST AND A CORRESPONDING INTEREST ON THE PART OF
THE READER WHICH ARE SCARCELY SURPASSED BY THE BEST OF THE
CANTERBURY TALES
THE POET HOWEVER TARRIES LONG ON THE WAY
TO THE HOUSE OF FAME AS POPE SAYS IN HIS ADVERTISEMENT THE
READER WHO WOULD COMPARE HIS WITH CHAUCER'S POEM MAY
BEGIN WITH CHAUCER'S THIRD BOOK OF FAME THERE BEING NOTHING
IN THE TWO FIRST BOOKS THAT ANSWERS TO THEIR TITLE THE FIRST BOOK
OPENS WITH A KIND OF PROLOGUE ACTUALLY SO MARKED AND CALLED IN
EARLIER EDITIONS IN WHICH THE AUTHOR SPECULATES ON THE CAUSES OF
DREAMS AVERS THAT NEVER ANY MAN HAD SUCH A DREAM AS HE HAD
ON THE TENTH OF DECEMBER AND PRAYS THE GOD OF SLEEP TO HELP
HIM TO INTERPRET THE DREAM AND THE MOVER OF ALL THINGS TO
REWARD OR AFFLICT THOSE READERS WHO TAKE THE DREAM WELL OR ILL
THEN HE RELATES THAT HAVING FALLEN ASLEEP HE FANCIED HIMSELF
WITHIN A TEMPLE OF GLASS THE ABODE OF VENUS THE WALLS OF
WHICH WERE PAINTED WITH THE STORY OF AENEAS
THE PAINTINGS ARE
DESCRIBED AT LENGTH AND THEN THE POET TELLS US THAT COMING OUT
OF THE TEMPLE HE FOUND HIMSELF ON A VAST SANDY PLAIN AND SAW
HIGH IN HEAVEN AN EAGLE THAT BEGAN TO DESCEND TOWARDS HIM
WITH THE PROLOGUE THE FIRST BOOK NUMBERS 508 LINES OF WHICH
192 ONLY MORE THAN ARE ACTUALLY CONCERNED WITH OR DIRECTLY
LEAD TOWARDS THE REAL SUBJECT OF THE POEM ARE GIVEN HERE
THE
SECOND BOOK CONTAINING 582 LINES OF WHICH 176 WILL BE FOUND
IN THIS EDITION IS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO THE VOYAGE FROM THE TEMPLE
OF VENUS TO THE HOUSE OF FAME WHICH THE DREAMER
ACCOMPLISHES IN THE EAGLE'S CLAWS
THE BIRD HAS BEEN SENT BY
JOVE TO DO THE POET SOME SOLACE IN REWARD OF HIS LABOURS FOR
THE CAUSE OF LOVE AND DURING THE TRANSIT THROUGH THE AIR THE
MESSENGER DISCOURSES OBLIGINGLY AND LEARNEDLY WITH HIS HUMAN
BURDEN ON THE THEORY OF SOUND BY WHICH ALL THAT IS SPOKEN MUST
NEEDS REACH THE HOUSE OF FAME AND ON OTHER MATTERS SUGGESTED
BY THEIR ERRAND AND THEIR OBSERVATIONS BY THE WAY
THE THIRD
BOOK OF 1080 LINES ONLY A SCORE OF WHICH JUST AT THE OUTSET
HAVE BEEN OMITTED BRINGS US TO THE REAL PITH OF THE POEM
IT
FINDS THE POET CLOSE TO THE HOUSE OF FAME BUILT ON A ROCK OF ICE
ENGRAVED WITH NAMES MANY OF WHICH ARE HALF MELTED AWAY
ENTERING THE GORGEOUS PALACE HE FINDS ALL MANNER OF MINSTRELS
AND HISTORIANS HARPERS PIPERS AND TRUMPETERS OF FAME
MAGICIANS JUGGLERS SORCERERS AND MANY OTHERS
ON A THRONE OF
RUBY SITS THE GODDESS SEEMING AT ONE MOMENT OF BUT A CUBIT'S
STATURE AT THE NEXT TOUCHING HEAVEN AND AT EITHER HAND ON
PILLARS STAND THE GREAT AUTHORS WHO BEAR UP THE NAME OF
ANCIENT NATIONS
CROWDS OF PEOPLE ENTER THE HALL FROM ALL REGIONS
OF EARTH PRAYING THE GODDESS TO GIVE THEM GOOD OR EVIL FAME
WITH AND WITHOUT THEIR OWN DESERTS AND THEY RECEIVE ANSWERS
FAVOURABLE NEGATIVE OR CONTRARY ACCORDING TO THE CAPRICE OF
FAME
PURSUING HIS RESEARCHES FURTHER OUT OF THE REGION OF
REPUTATION OR FAME PROPER INTO THAT OF TIDINGS OR RUMOURS THE
POET IS LED BY A MAN WHO HAS ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH
HIM TO A VAST WHIRLING HOUSE OF TWIGS EVER OPEN TO THE ARRIVAL
OF TIDINGS EVER FULL OF MURMURINGS WHISPERINGS AND CLATTERINGS
COMING FROM THE VAST CROWDS THAT FILL IT FOR EVERY RUMOUR
EVERY PIECE OF NEWS EVERY FALSE REPORT APPEARS THERE IN THE
SHAPE OF THE PERSON WHO UTTERS IT OR PASSES IT ON DOWN IN EARTH
OUT AT THE WINDOWS INNUMERABLE THE TIDINGS PASS TO FAME WHO
GIVES TO EACH REPORT ITS NAME AND DURATION AND IN THE HOUSE
TRAVELLERS PILGRIMS PARDONERS COURIERS LOVERS C MAKE A
HUGE CLAMOUR
BUT HERE THE POET MEETS WITH A MAN OF GREAT
AUTHORITY AND HALF AFRAID AWAKES SKILFULLY WHETHER BY
INTENTION FATIGUE OR ACCIDENT LEAVING THE READER DISAPPOINTED
BY THE NONFULFILMENT OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE PROMISES OF FURTHER
DISCLOSURES
THE POEM NOT LEAST IN THE PASSAGES THE OMISSION OF
WHICH HAS BEEN DICTATED BY THE EXIGENCIES OF THE PRESENT
VOLUME IS FULL OF TESTIMONY TO THE VAST ACQUAINTANCE OF CHAUCER
WITH LEARNING ANCIENT AND MODERN OVID VIRGIL STATIUS ARE
EQUALLY AT HIS COMMAND TO ILLUSTRATE HIS NARRATIVE OR TO FURNISH
THE GROUND WORK OF HIS DESCRIPTIONS WHILE ARCHITECTURE THE
ARABIC NUMERATION THE THEORY OF SOUND AND THE EFFECTS OF
GUNPOWDER ARE ONLY A FEW AMONG THE TOPICS OF HIS OWN TIME OF
WHICH THE POET TREATS WITH THE EASE OF PROFICIENT KNOWLEDGE
NOT LEAST INTERESTING ARE THE VIVID TOUCHES IN WHICH CHAUCER
SKETCHES THE ROUTINE OF HIS LABORIOUS AND ALMOST RECLUSE DAILY
LIFE WHILE THE STRENGTH INDIVIDUALITY AND HUMOUR THAT MARK THE
DIDACTIC PORTION OF THE POEM PROVE THAT THE HOUSE OF FAME
WAS ONE OF THE POET'S RIPER PRODUCTIONS
GOD TURN US EV'RY DREAM TO GOOD
FOR IT IS WONDER THING BY THE ROOD CROSS 1
TO MY WITTE WHAT CAUSETH SWEVENS DREAMS
EITHER ON MORROWS OR ON EVENS
AND WHY TH'EFFECT FOLLOWETH OF SOME
AND OF SOME IT SHALL NEVER COME
WHY THIS IS AN AVISION
AND THIS A REVELATION
WHY THIS A DREAM WHY THAT A SWEVEN
AND NOT TO EV'RY MAN LIKE EVEN ALIKE
WHY THIS A PHANTOM WHY THESE ORACLES
I N'OT BUT WHOSO OF THESE MIRACLES
THE CAUSES KNOWETH BET THAN I
DIVINE HE FOR I CERTAINLY DEFINE
NE CAN THEM NOT NOR EVER THINK DO NOT KNOW THEM
TO BUSY MY WIT FOR TO SWINK LABOUR
TO KNOW OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE
THE GENDERS NEITHER THE DISTANCE
OF TIMES OF THEM NOR THE CAUSES
FOR WHY THAT THIS MORE THAN THAT CAUSE IS
OR IF FOLKE'S COMPLEXIONS
MAKE THEM DREAM OF REFLECTIONS
OR ELLES THUS AS OTHERS SAYN
FOR TOO GREAT FEEBLENESS OF THE BRAIN
BY ABSTINENCE OR BY SICKNESS
BY PRISON STRIFE OR GREAT DISTRESS
OR ELLES BY DISORDINANCE DERANGEMENT
OF NATURAL ACCUSTOMANCE MODE OF LIFE
THAT SOME MEN BE TOO CURIOUS
IN STUDY OR MELANCHOLIOUS
OR THUS SO INLY FULL OF DREAD
THAT NO MAN MAY THEM BOOTE BEDE AFFORD THEM RELIEF
OR ELLES THAT DEVOTION
OF SOME AND CONTEMPLATION
CAUSETH TO THEM SUCH DREAMES OFT
OR THAT THE CRUEL LIFE UNSOFT
OF THEM THAT UNKIND LOVES LEAD
THAT OFTEN HOPE MUCH OR DREAD
THAT PURELY THEIR IMPRESSIONS
CAUSE THEM TO HAVE VISIONS
OR IF THAT SPIRITS HAVE THE MIGHT
TO MAKE FOLK TO DREAM A NIGHT
OR IF THE SOUL OF PROPER KIND ITS OWN NATURE
BE SO PERFECT AS MEN FIND
THAT IT FOREWOT WHAT IS TO COME FOREKNOWS
AND THAT IT WARNETH ALL AND SOME
OF EV'REACH OF THEIR ADVENTURES
BY VISIONS OR BY FIGURES
BUT THAT OUR FLESHE HATH NO MIGHT
TO UNDERSTANDEN IT ARIGHT
FOR IT IS WARNED TOO DARKLY
BUT WHY THE CAUSE IS NOT WOT I
WELL WORTH OF THIS THING GREATE CLERKS 2
THAT TREAT OF THIS AND OTHER WORKS
FOR I OF NONE OPINION
WILL AS NOW MAKE MENTION
BUT ONLY THAT THE HOLY ROOD
TURN US EVERY DREAM TO GOOD
FOR NEVER SINCE THAT I WAS BORN
NOR NO MAN ELLES ME BEFORN
METTE AS I TROWE STEADFASTLY DREAMED
SO WONDERFUL A DREAM AS I
THE TENTHE DAY NOW OF DECEMBER
THE WHICH AS I CAN IT REMEMBER
I WILL YOU TELLEN EV'RY DEAL WHIT
BUT AT MY BEGINNING TRUSTE WEEL WELL
I WILL MAKE INVOCATION
WITH SPECIAL DEVOTION
UNTO THE GOD OF SLEEP ANON
THAT DWELLETH IN A CAVE OF STONE 3
UPON A STREAM THAT COMES FROM LETE
THAT IS A FLOOD OF HELL UNSWEET
BESIDE A FOLK MEN CALL CIMMERIE
THERE SLEEPETH AY THIS GOD UNMERRY
WITH HIS SLEEPY THOUSAND SONES
THAT ALWAY FOR TO SLEEP THEIR WON IS WONT CUSTOM
AND TO THIS GOD THAT I OF READ TELL OF

TO MAKE LITHE THAT ERST WAS HARD
BUT AS I SLEPT ME METTE I WAS
WITHIN A TEMPLE MADE OF GLASS
IN WHICH THERE WERE MORE IMAGES
OF GOLD STANDING IN SUNDRY STAGES
AND MORE RICHE TABERNACLES
AND WITH PIERRIE MORE PINNACLES GEMS
AND MORE CURIOUS PORTRAITURES
AND QUAINTE MANNER OF FIGURES STRANGE KINDS
OF GOLDE WORK THAN I SAW EVER
BUT CERTAINLY I WISTE NEVER KNEW
WHERE THAT IT WAS BUT WELL WIST I
IT WAS OF VENUS READILY
THIS TEMPLE FOR IN PORTRAITURE
I SAW ANON RIGHT HER FIGURE
NAKED FLOATING IN A SEA 7
AND ALSO ON HER HEAD PARDIE
HER ROSE GARLAND WHITE AND RED
AND HER COMB TO COMB HER HEAD
HER DOVES AND DAN CUPIDO
HER BLINDE SON AND VULCANO 8
THAT IN HIS FACE WAS FULL BROWN
AS HE ROAMED UP AND DOWN THE DREAMER SAW ON THE WALL A
TABLET OF BRASS INSCRIBED WITH THE OPENING LINES OF THE AENEID
WHILE THE WHOLE STORY OF AENEAS WAS TOLD IN THE PORTRAITURES
AND GOLD WORK
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LINES ARE DEVOTED
TO THE DESCRIPTION BUT THEY MERELY EMBODY VIRGIL'S ACCOUNT OF
AENEAS' ADVENTURES FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF TROY TO HIS ARRIVAL IN
ITALY AND THE ONLY CHARACTERISTIC PASSAGE IS THE FOLLOWING
REFLECTION SUGGESTED BY THE DEATH OF DIDO FOR HER PERFIDIOUS BUT
FATE COMPELLED GUEST
LO HOW A WOMAN DOTH AMISS
TO LOVE HIM THAT UNKNOWEN IS
FOR BY CHRIST LO THUS IT FARETH
IT IS NOT ALL GOLD THAT GLARETH GLITTERS
FOR ALL SO BROOK I WELL MY HEAD
THERE MAY BE UNDER GOODLIHEAD FAIR APPEARANCE
COVER'D MANY A SHREWED VICE CURSED
THEREFORE LET NO WIGHT BE SO NICE FOOLISH
TO TAKE A LOVE ONLY FOR CHEER LOOKS
OR SPEECH OR FOR FRIENDLY MANNERE
FOR THIS SHALL EV'RY WOMAN FIND
THAT SOME MAN OF HIS PURE KIND BY FORCE OF HIS NATURE
WILL SHOWEN OUTWARD THE FAIREST
TILL HE HAVE CAUGHT THAT WHICH HIM LEST PLEASES
AND THEN ANON WILL CAUSES FIND
AND SWEARE HOW SHE IS UNKIND
OR FALSE OR PRIVY DOUBLE WAS
SECRETLY
ALL THIS SAY I BY AENEAS WITH REFERENCE TO
AND DIDO AND HER NICE LEST FOOLISH PLEASURE
THAT LOVED ALL TOO SOON A GUEST
THEREFORE I WILL SAY A PROVERB
THAT HE THAT FULLY KNOWS THE HERB
MAY SAFELY LAY IT TO HIS EYE
WITHOUTE DREAD THIS IS NO LIE
DOUBT
WHEN THE DREAMER HAD SEEN ALL THE SIGHTS IN THE TEMPLE HE
BECAME DESIROUS TO KNOW WHO HAD WORKED ALL THOSE WONDERS
AND IN WHAT COUNTRY HE WAS SO HE RESOLVED TO GO OUT AT THE
WICKET IN SEARCH OF SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT TELL HIM
WHEN I OUT AT THE DOORES CAME
I FAST ABOUTE ME BEHELD
THEN SAW I BUT A LARGE FELD OPEN COUNTRY
AS FAR AS THAT I MIGHTE SEE
WITHOUTE TOWN OR HOUSE OR TREE
OR BUSH OR GRASS OR ERED LAND PLOUGHED 9
FOR ALL THE FIELD WAS BUT OF SAND
AS SMALL AS MEN MAY SEE IT LIE FINE
IN THE DESERT OF LIBYE
NOR NO MANNER CREATURE
THAT IS FORMED BY NATURE
THERE SAW I ME TO REDE OR WISS ADVISE OR DIRECT
O CHRIST THOUGHT I THAT ART IN BLISS
FROM PHANTOM AND ILLUSION VAIN FANCY AND DECEPTION
ME SAVE AND WITH DEVOTION
MINE EYEN TO THE HEAV'N I CAST
THEN WAS I WARE AT THE LAST
THAT FASTE BY THE SUN ON HIGH
AS KENNEN MIGHT I WITH MINE EYE AS WELL AS I MIGHT DISCERN
ME THOUGHT I SAW AN EAGLE SOAR
BUT THAT IT SEEMED MUCHE MORE LARGER
THAN I HAD ANY EAGLE SEEN
THIS IS AS SOOTH AS DEATH CERTAIN
IT WAS OF GOLD AND SHONE SO BRIGHT
THAT NEVER SAW MEN SUCH A SIGHT
BUT IF THE HEAVEN HAD Y WON UNLESS
ALL NEW FROM GOD ANOTHER SUN
SO SHONE THE EAGLE'S FEATHERS BRIGHT
AND SOMEWHAT DOWNWARD GAN IT LIGHT DESCEND ALIGHT
THE SECOND BOOK OPENS WITH A BRIEF INVOCATION OF VENUS AND
OF THOUGHT THEN IT PROCEEDS
THIS EAGLE OF WHICH I HAVE YOU TOLD
THAT SHONE WITH FEATHERS AS OF GOLD
WHICH THAT SO HIGH BEGAN TO SOAR
I GAN BEHOLDE MORE AND MORE
TO SEE HER BEAUTY AND THE WONDER
BUT NEVER WAS THERE DINT OF THUNDER
NOR THAT THING THAT MEN CALLE FOUDRE THUNDERBOLT
THAT SMOTE SOMETIMES A TOWN TO POWDER
AND IN HIS SWIFTE COMING BRENN'D BURNED
THAT SO SWITHE GAN DESCEND RAPIDLY
AS THIS FOWL WHEN THAT IT BEHELD
THAT I A ROAM WAS IN THE FELD
AND WITH HIS GRIM PAWES STRONG
WITHIN HIS SHARPE NAILES LONG
ME FLYING AT A SWAP HE HENT SWOOP SEIZED
AND WITH HIS SOURS 10 AGAIN UP WENT
ME CARRYING IN HIS CLAWES STARK STRONG
AS LIGHT AS I HAD BEEN A LARK
HOW HIGH I CANNOT TELLE YOU
FOR I CAME UP I WIST NOT HOW
THE POET FAINTS THROUGH BEWILDERMENT AND FEAR BUT THE EAGLE
SPEAKING WITH THE VOICE OF A MAN RECALLS HIM TO HIMSELF AND
COMFORTS HIM BY THE ASSURANCE THAT WHAT NOW BEFALLS HIM IS FOR
HIS INSTRUCTION AND PROFIT
ANSWERING THE POET'S UNSPOKEN
INQUIRY WHETHER HE IS NOT TO DIE OTHERWISE OR WHETHER JOVE WILL
HIM STELLIFY THE EAGLE SAYS THAT HE HAS BEEN SENT BY JUPITER OUT
OF HIS GREAT RUTH
FOR THAT THOU HAST SO TRUELY
SO LONG SERVED ENTENTIVELY WITH ATTENTIVE ZEAL
HIS BLINDE NEPHEW CUPIDO GRANDSON
AND FAIRE VENUS ALSO
WITHOUTE GUUERDON EVER YET
AND NATHELESS HAST SET THY WIT
ALTHOUGH THAT IN THY HEAD FULL LITE IS LITTLE
TO MAKE BOOKES SONGS AND DITTIES
IN RHYME OR ELLES IN CADENCE
AS THOU BEST CANST IN REVERENCE
OF LOVE AND OF HIS SERVANTS EKE
THAT HAVE HIS SERVICE SOUGHT AND SEEK
AND PAINED THEE TO PRAISE HIS ART
ALTHOUGH THOU HADDEST NEVER PART 11
WHEREFORE ALL SO GOD ME BLESS
JOVIS HOLDS IT GREAT HUMBLESS
AND VIRTUE EKE THAT THOU WILT MAKE
A NIGHT FULL OFT THY HEAD TO ACHE
IN THY STUDY SO THOU WRITEST
AND EVERMORE OF LOVE ENDITEST
IN HONOUR OF HIM AND PRAISINGS
AND IN HIS FOLKE'S FURTHERINGS
AND IN THEIR MATTER ALL DEVISEST RELATES
AND NOT HIM NOR HIS FOLK DESPISEST
ALTHOUGH THOU MAY'ST GO IN THE DANCE
OF THEM THAT HIM LIST NOT ADVANCE
WHEREFORE AS I SAID NOW Y WIS
JUPITER WELL CONSIDERS THIS
AND ALSO BEAUSIRE OTHER THINGS GOOD SIR
THAT IS THAT THOU HAST NO TIDINGS
OF LOVE'S FOLK IF THEY BE GLAD
NOR OF NAUGHT ELLES THAT GOD MADE
AND NOT ONLY FROM FAR COUNTRY
THAT NO TIDINGS COME TO THEE
BUT OF THY VERY NEIGHEBOURS
THAT DWELLEN ALMOST AT THY DOORS
THOU HEAREST NEITHER THAT NOR THIS
FOR WHEN THY LABOUR ALL DONE IS
AND HAST Y MADE THY RECKONINGS 12
INSTEAD OF REST AND NEWE THINGS
THOU GO'ST HOME TO THY HOUSE ANON
AND ALL SO DUMB AS ANY STONE
THOU SITTEST AT ANOTHER BOOK
TILL FULLY DAZED IS THY LOOK BLINDED
AND LIVEST THUS AS A HERMITE
ALTHOUGH THINE ABSTINENCE IS LITE 13 LITTLE
THEREFORE HAS JOVE APPOINTED THE EAGLE TO TAKE THE POET TO THE
HOUSE OF FAME TO DO HIM SOME PLEASURE IN RECOMPENSE FOR HIS
DEVOTION TO CUPID AND HE WILL HEAR SAYS THE BIRD
WHEN WE BE COME THERE AS I SAY
MORE WONDROUS THINGES DARE I LAY BET
OF LOVE'S FOLKE MORE TIDINGS
BOTH SOOTHE SAWES AND LEASINGS TRUE SAYINGS AND LIES
AND MORE LOVES NEW BEGUN
AND LONG Y SERVED LOVES WON
AND MORE LOVES CASUALLY
THAT BE BETID NO MAN KNOWS WHY HAPPENED BY CHANCE
BUT AS A BLIND MAN STARTS A HARE
AND MORE JOLLITY AND WELFARE
WHILE THAT THEY FINDE LOVE OF STEEL LOVE TRUE AS STEEL
AS THINKETH THEM AND OVER ALL WEEL
MORE DISCORDS AND MORE JEALOUSIES
MORE MURMURS AND MORE NOVELTIES
AND MORE DISSIMULATIONS
AND FEIGNED REPARATIONS
AND MORE BEARDES IN TWO HOURS
WITHOUTE RAZOR OR SCISSOURS
Y MADE 14 THAN GRAINES BE OF SANDS
AND EKE MORE HOLDING IN HANDS EMBRACINGS
AND ALSO MORE RENOVELANCES RENEWINGS
OF OLD FORLETEN ACQUAINTANCES BROKEN OFF ACQUAINTANCESHIPS
MORE LOVE DAYS 15 AND MORE ACCORDS AGREEMENTS
THAN ON INSTRUMENTS BE CHORDS
AND EKE OF LOVE MORE EXCHANGES
THAN EVER CORNES WERE IN GRANGES BARNS
THE POET CAN SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT THOUGH FAME HAD ALL THE PIES
MAGPIES AND ALL THE SPIES IN A KINGDOM SHE SHOULD HEAR SO
MUCH BUT THE EAGLE PROCEEDS TO PROVE THAT SHE CAN
FIRST SHALT THOU HEARE WHERE SHE DWELLETH
AND SO AS THINE OWN BOOKE TELLETH 16
HER PALACE STANDS AS I SHALL SAY
RIGHT EV'N IN MIDDES OF THE WAY
BETWEENE HEAV'N AND EARTH AND SEA
THAT WHATSOE'ER IN ALL THESE THREE
IS SPOKEN PRIVY OR APERT SECRETLY OR OPENLY
THE AIR THERETO IS SO OVERT CLEAR
AND STANDS EKE IN SO JUST A PLACE SUITABLE
THAT EV'RY SOUND MUST TO IT PACE
OR WHATSO COMES FROM ANY TONGUE
BE IT ROWNED READ OR SUNG WHISPERED
OR SPOKEN IN SURETY OR DREAD DOUBT
CERTAIN IT MUST THITHER NEED IT MUST NEEDS GO THITHER
THE EAGLE IN A LONG DISCOURSE DEMONSTRATES THAT AS ALL NATURAL
THINGS HAVE A NATURAL PLACE TOWARDS WHICH THEY MOVE BY NATURAL
INCLINATION AND AS SOUND IS ONLY BROKEN AIR SO EVERY SOUND
MUST COME TO FAME'S HOUSE THOUGH IT WERE PIPED OF A MOUSE
ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE BY WHICH EVERY PART OF A MASS OF WATER
IS AFFECTED BY THE CASTING IN OF A STONE
THE POET IS ALL THE WHILE
BORNE UPWARD ENTERTAINED WITH VARIOUS INFORMATION BY THE BIRD
WHICH AT LAST CRIES OUT
HOLD UP THY HEAD FOR ALL IS WELL
SAINT JULIAN LO BON HOSTEL 17
SEE HERE THE HOUSE OF FAME LO
MAY'ST THOU NOT HEARE THAT I DO

WHEN JOVIS HATH THE AIR Y BEAT
BUT IT DOTH ME FOR FEARE SWEAT

AND SAIDE WALKE FORTH APACE
AND TAKE THINE ADVENTURE OR CASE THY CHANCE OF WHAT
THAT THOU SHALT FIND IN FAME'S PLACE MAY BEFALL
NOW QUOTH I WHILE WE HAVE SPACE
TO SPEAK ERE THAT I GO FROM THEE
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AS TELLE ME

IF THIS NOISE THAT I HEAR

OF FOLK THAT DOWN IN EARTHE DWELL
AND COMETH HERE IN THE SAME WISE
AS I THEE HEARD ERE THIS DEVISE
AND THAT THERE LIVING BODY N'IS IS NOT

THAT MAKETH ALL THIS LOUDE FARE HUBBUB ADO
NO ANSWERED HE BY SAINT CLARE
AND ALL SO WISLY GOD REDE ME SO SURELY GOD
BUT ONE THING I WILL WARNE THEE GUIDE ME
OF THE WHICH THOU WILT HAVE WONDER
LO TO THE HOUSE OF FAME YONDER
THOU KNOW'ST HOW COMETH EV'RY SPEECH
IT NEEDETH NOT THEE EFT TO TEACH
AGAIN
BUT UNDERSTAND NOW RIGHT WELL THIS
WHEN ANY SPEECH Y COMEN IS
UP TO THE PALACE ANON RIGHT
IT WAXETH LIKE THE SAME WIGHT BECOMES PERSON
WHICH THAT THE WORD IN EARTHE SPAKE
BE HE CLOTH'D IN RED OR BLACK
AND SO WEARETH HIS LIKENESS
AND SPEAKS THE WORD THAT THOU WILT GUESS FANCY
THAT IT THE SAME BODY BE
WHETHER MAN OR WOMAN HE OR SHE
AND IS NOT THIS A WONDROUS THING
YES QUOTH I THEN BY HEAVEN'S KING
AND WITH THIS WORD FAREWELL QUOTH HE
AND HERE I WILL ABIDE THEE WAIT FOR
AND GOD OF HEAVEN SEND THEE GRACE
SOME GOOD TO LEAREN IN THIS PLACE LEARN
AND I OF HIM TOOK LEAVE ANON
AND GAN FORTH TO THE PALACE GO'N
AT THE OPENING OF THE THIRD BOOK CHAUCER BRIEFLY INVOKES
APOLLO'S GUIDANCE AND ENTREATS HIM BECAUSE THE RHYME IS LIGHT
AND LEWD TO MAKE IT SOMEWHAT AGREEABLE THOUGH SOME VERSE
FAIL IN A SYLLABLE IF THE GOD ANSWERS THE PRAYER THE POET
PROMISES TO KISS THE NEXT LAUREL TREE 18 HE SEES AND HE
PROCEEDS
WHEN I WAS FROM THIS EAGLE GONE
I GAN BEHOLD UPON THIS PLACE
AND CERTAIN ERE I FARTHER PACE
I WILL YOU ALL THE SHAPE DEVISE DESCRIBE
OF HOUSE AND CITY AND ALL THE WISE
HOW I GAN TO THIS PLACE APPROACH
THAT STOOD UPON SO HIGH A ROCHE ROCK 19
HIGHER STANDETH NONE IN SPAIN
BUT UP I CLIMB'D WITH MUCHE PAIN
AND THOUGH TO CLIMBE GRIEVED ME COST ME PAINFUL EFFORT
YET I ENTENTIVE WAS TO SEE ATTENTIVE
AND FOR TO PORE WONDROUS LOW GAZE CLOSELY
IF I COULD ANY WISE KNOW
WHAT MANNER STONE THIS ROCKE WAS
FOR IT WAS LIKE A THING OF GLASS
BUT THAT IT SHONE FULL MORE CLEAR
BUT OF WHAT CONGEALED MATTERE
IT WAS I WIST NOT READILY
BUT AT THE LAST ESPIED I
AND FOUND THAT IT WAS EV'RY DEAL ENTIRELY
A ROCK OF ICE AND NOT OF STEEL
THOUGHT I BY SAINT THOMAS OF KENT 20
THIS WERE A FEEBLE FUNDAMENT FOUNDATION
TO BUILDEN A PLACE SO HIGH ON WHICH TO BUILD
HE OUGHT HIM LITE TO GLORIFY LITTLE
THAT HEREON BUILT GOD SO ME SAVE
THEN SAW I ALL THE HALF Y GRAVE 21
WITH FAMOUS FOLKE'S NAMES FELE MANY
THAT HADDE BEEN IN MUCHE WEAL GOOD FORTUNE
AND THEIR FAMES WIDE Y BLOW
BUT WELL UNNETHES MIGHT I KNOW SCARCELY
ANY LETTERS FOR TO READ

THEY WERE ALMOST OFF THAWED SO
THAT OF THE LETTERS ONE OR TWO
WERE MOLT AWAY OF EV'RY NAME MELTED
SO UNFAMOUS WAS WOX THEIR FAME BECOME
BUT MEN SAY WHAT MAY EVER LAST
THEN GAN I IN MY HEART TO CAST CONJECTURE
THAT THEY WERE MOLT AWAY FOR HEAT
AND NOT AWAY WITH STORMES BEAT
FOR ON THE OTHER SIDE I SEY SAW
OF THIS HILL THAT NORTHWARD LAY
HOW IT WAS WRITTEN FULL OF NAMES
OF FOLKE THAT HAD GREATE FAMES
OF OLDE TIMES AND YET THEY WERE
AS FRESH AS MEN HAD WRIT THEM THERE
THE SELFE DAY RIGHT ERE THAT HOUR

BUT WELL I WISTE WHAT IT MADE MEANT
IT WAS CONSERVED WITH THE SHADE
ALL THE WRITING WHICH I SIGH SAW
OF A CASTLE THAT STOOD ON HIGH
AND STOOD EKE ON SO COLD A PLACE
THAT HEAT MIGHT IT NOT DEFACE INJURE DESTROY
THEN GAN I ON THIS HILL TO GO'N
AND FOUND UPON THE COP A WON SUMMIT 22 HOUSE

THE BEAUTY OF THAT LIKE PLACE
NOR COULDE CASTE NO COMPASS FIND NO CONTRIVANCE
SUCH ANOTHER FOR TO MAKE
THAT MIGHT OF BEAUTY BE ITS MAKE MATCH EQUAL
NOR ONE SO WONDROUSLY Y WROUGHT

THEN SAW I STANDING THEM BEHIND

THAT BE AT FEASTES WITH THE BRIDE
AND MANY A FLUTE AND LILTING HORN

OF ALL THE PEOPLE I THERE SAY SAW
FROM HENCE EVEN TO DOOMESDAY
WHEN I HAD ALL THIS FOLK BEHOLD
AND FOUND ME LOOSE AND NOT Y HOLD AT LIBERTY AND UNRESTRAINED
AND I HAD MUSED LONGE WHILE
UPON THESE WALLES OF BERYLE
THAT SHONE LIGHTER THAN ANY GLASS
AND MADE WELL MORE THAN IT WAS MUCH GREATER
TO SEEMEN EV'RYTHING Y WIS

UNDER THE CASTLE FASTE BY
A HOUSE THAT DOMUS DAEDALI
THAT LABYRINTHUS 81 CALLED IS
N'AS MADE SO WONDROUSLY Y WIS WAS NOT
NOR HALF SO QUAINTLY WAS Y WROUGHT
STRANGELY
AND EVERMORE AS SWIFT AS THOUGHT
THIS QUAINTE HOUSE ABOUTE WENT STRANGE
THAT NEVERMORE IT STILLE STENT CEASED TO MOVE
AND THEREOUT CAME SO GREAT A NOISE
THAT HAD IT STOODEN UPON OISE 82
MEN MIGHT HAVE HEARD IT EASILY
TO ROME I TROWE SICKERLY CONFIDENTLY BELIEVE
AND THE NOISE WHICH I HEARD
FOR ALL THE WORLD RIGHT SO IT FAR'D
AS DOTH THE ROUTING OF THE STONE RUSHING NOISE
THAT FROM THE ENGINE 83 IS LET GO'N
AND ALL THIS HOUSE OF WHICH I READ TELL YOU
WAS MADE OF TWIGGES SALLOW RED WILLOW
AND GREEN EKE AND SOME WERE WHITE
SUCH AS MEN TO THE CAGES TWIGHT PULL TO MAKE CAGES
OR MAKEN OF THESE PANNIERS
OR ELLES HUTCHES OR DOSSERS BACK BASKETS
THAT FOR THE SWOUGH AND FOR THE TWIGS RUSHING NOISE
THIS HOUSE WAS ALL SO FULL OF GIGS SOUNDS OF WIND
AND ALL SO FULL EKE OF CHIRKINGS CREAKINGS
AND OF MANY OTHER WORKINGS
AND EKE THIS HOUSE HAD OF ENTRIES
AS MANY AS LEAVES BE ON TREES
IN SUMMER WHEN THAT THEY BE GREEN
AND ON THE ROOF MEN MAY YET SEE'N
A THOUSAND HOLES AND WELL MO'
TO LET THE SOUNDES OUTE GO
AND BY DAY IN EV'RY TIDE CONTINUALLY
BE ALL THE DOORES OPEN WIDE
AND BY NIGHT EACH ONE UNSHET UNSHUT OPEN
NOR PORTER THERE IS NONE TO LET HINDER
NO MANNER TIDINGS IN TO PACE
NOR EVER REST IS IN THAT PLACE
THAT IT N'IS FILL'D FULL OF TIDINGS IS NOT
EITHER LOUD OR OF WHISPERINGS
AND EVER ALL THE HOUSE'S ANGLES
ARE FULL OF ROWNINGS AND OF JANGLES WHISPERINGS AND CHATTERINGS
OF WARS OF PEACE OF MARRIAGES
OF RESTS OF LABOUR OF VOYAGES
OF ABODE OF DEATH OF LIFE
OF LOVE OF HATE ACCORD OF STRIFE
OF LOSS OF LORE AND OF WINNINGS
OF HEALTH OF SICKNESS OF BUILDINGS
OF FAIRE WEATHER AND TEMPESTS
OF QUALM OF FOLKES AND OF BEASTS SICKNESS
OF DIVERS TRANSMUTATIONS
OF ESTATES AND OF REGIONS
OF TRUST OF DREAD OF JEALOUSY DOUBT
OF WIT OF CUNNING OF FOLLY
OF PLENTY AND OF GREAT FAMINE
OF CHEAP OF DEARTH AND OF RUIN CHEAPNESS DEARNESS OF FOOD
OF GOOD OR OF MIS GOVERNMENT
OF FIRE AND DIVERSE ACCIDENT
AND LO THIS HOUSE OF WHICH I WRITE
SICKER BE YE IT WAS NOT LITE BE ASSURED SMALL
FOR IT WAS SIXTY MILE OF LENGTH
ALL WAS THE TIMBER OF NO STRENGTH ALTHOUGH
YET IT IS FOUNDED TO ENDURE
WHILE THAT IT LIST TO ADVENTURE WHILE FORTUNE PLEASES
THAT IS THE MOTHER OF TIDINGS
AS IS THE SEA OF WELLS AND SPRINGS
AND IT WAS SHAPEN LIKE A CAGE
CERTES QUOTH I IN ALL MINE AGE LIFE
NE'ER SAW I SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS
AND AS I WONDER'D ME Y WIS
UPON THIS HOUSE THEN WARE WAS I
HOW THAT MINE EAGLE FASTE BY
WAS PERCHED HIGH UPON A STONE
AND I GAN STRAIGHTE TO HIM GO'N
AND SAIDE THUS I PRAYE THEE
THAT THOU A WHILE ABIDE ME WAIT FOR
FOR GODDE'S LOVE AND LET ME SEE
WHAT WONDERS IN THIS PLACE BE
FOR YET PARAUNTRE I MAY LEAR PERADVENTURE LEARN
SOME GOOD THEREON OR SOMEWHAT HEAR
THAT LEFE ME WERE ERE THAT I WENT WERE PLEASING TO ME
PETER THAT IS MINE INTENT
QUOTH HE TO ME THEREFORE I DWELL TARRY
BUT CERTAIN ONE THING I THEE TELL
THAT BUT I BRINGE THEE THEREIN UNLESS
THOU SHALT NEVER CAN BEGIN BE ABLE
TO COME INTO IT OUT OF DOUBT
SO FAST IT WHIRLETH LO ABOUT
BUT SINCE THAT JOVIS OF HIS GRACE
AS I HAVE SAID WILL THEE SOLACE
FINALLY WITH THESE ILKE THINGS SAME
THESE UNCOUTH SIGHTES AND TIDINGS
TO PASS AWAY THY HEAVINESS
SUCH RUTH HATH HE OF THY DISTRESS COMPASSION
THAT THOU SUFF'REST DEBONAIRLY GENTLY
AND KNOW'ST THYSELVEN UTTERLY
DESPERATE OF ALLE BLISS
SINCE THAT FORTUNE HATH MADE AMISS
THE FRUIT OF ALL THY HEARTE'S REST
LANGUISH AND EKE IN POINT TO BREST ON THE POINT OF BREAKING
BUT HE THROUGH HIS MIGHTY MERITE
WILL DO THEE EASE ALL BE IT LITE LITTLE
AND GAVE EXPRESS COMMANDEMENT
TO WHICH I AM OBEDIENT
TO FURTHER THEE WITH ALL MY MIGHT
AND WISS AND TEACHE THEE ARIGHT DIRECT
WHERE THOU MAY'ST MOSTE TIDINGS HEAR
SHALT THOU ANON MANY ONE LEAR
AND WITH THIS WORD HE RIGHT ANON
HENT ME UP BETWIXT HIS TONE CAUGHT TOES
AND AT A WINDOW IN ME BROUGHT
THAT IN THIS HOUSE WAS AS ME THOUGHT
AND THEREWITHAL ME THOUGHT IT STENT STOPPED
AND NOTHING IT ABOUTE WENT
AND SET ME IN THE FLOORE DOWN
BUT SUCH A CONGREGATIOUN
OF FOLK AS I SAW ROAM ABOUT
SOME WITHIN AND SOME WITHOUT
WAS NEVER SEEN NOR SHALL BE EFT AGAIN HEREAFTER
THAT CERTES IN THE WORLD N' IS LEFT IS NOT
SO MANY FORMED BY NATURE
NOR DEAD SO MANY A CREATURE
THAT WELL UNNETHES IN THAT PLACE SCARCELY
HAD I A FOOTE BREADTH OF SPACE
AND EV'RY WIGHT THAT I SAW THERE
ROWN'D EVEREACH IN OTHER'S EAR WHISPERED
A NEWE TIDING PRIVILY
OR ELLES TOLD ALL OPENLY
RIGHT THUS AND SAIDE KNOW'ST NOT THOU
WHAT IS BETID LO RIGHTE NOW HAPPENED
NO QUOTH HE TELLE ME WHAT
AND THEN HE TOLD HIM THIS AND THAT
AND SWORE THERETO THAT IT WAS SOOTH
THUS HATH HE SAID AND THUS HE DO'TH
AND THUS SHALL 'T BE AND THUS HEARD I SAY
THAT SHALL BE FOUND THAT DARE I LAY WAGER
THAT ALL THE FOLK THAT IS ALIVE
HAVE NOT THE CUNNING TO DESCRIVE DESCRIBE
THE THINGES THAT I HEARDE THERE
WHAT ALOUD AND WHAT IN TH'EAR
BUT ALL THE WONDER MOST WAS THIS
WHEN ONE HAD HEARD A THING Y WIS
HE CAME STRAIGHT TO ANOTHER WIGHT
AND GAN HIM TELLEN ANON RIGHT
THE SAME TALE THAT TO HIM WAS TOLD
OR IT A FURLONG WAY WAS OLD 84
AND GAN SOMEWHAT FOR TO ECHE EKE ADD
TO THIS TIDING IN HIS SPEECH
MORE THAN IT EVER SPOKEN WAS
AND NOT SO SOON DEPARTED N'AS WAS
HE FROM HIM THAN THAT HE MET
WITH THE THIRD AND ERE HE LET
ANY STOUND HE TOLD HIM ALS' WITHOUT DELAYING A MOMEN
WERE THE TIDINGS TRUE OR FALSE
YET WOULD HE TELL IT NATHELESS
AND EVERMORE WITH MORE INCREASE
THAN IT WAS ERST THUS NORTH AND SOUTH AT FIRST
WENT EV'RY TIDING FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH
AND THAT INCREASING EVERMO'
AS FIRE IS WONT TO QUICK AND GO BECOME ALIVE AND SPREAD
FROM A SPARK Y SPRUNG AMISS
TILL ALL A CITY BURNT UP IS
AND WHEN THAT IT WAS FULL UP SPRUNG
AND WAXEN MORE ON EV'RY TONGUE INCREASED
THAN E'ER IT WAS IT WENT ANON
UP TO A WINDOW OUT TO GO'N
OR BUT IT MIGHTE THEREOUT PASS
IT GAN CREEP OUT AT SOME CREVASS CREVICE CHINK
AND FLY FORTH FASTE FOR THE NONCE
AND SOMETIMES SAW I THERE AT ONCE
A LEASING AND A SAD SOOTH SAW A FALSEHOOD AND AN EARNEST
THAT GAN OF ADVENTURE DRAW TRUE SAYING BY CHANCE
OUT AT A WINDOW FOR TO PACE
AND WHEN THEY METTEN IN THAT PLACE
THEY WERE CHECKED BOTH THE TWO
AND NEITHER OF THEM MIGHT OUT GO
FOR OTHER SO THEY GAN TO CROWD PUSH SQUEEZE EACH OTHER
TILL EACH OF THEM GAN CRYEN LOUD
LET ME GO FIRST NAY BUT LET ME
AND HERE I WILL ENSURE THEE
WITH VOWES IF THOU WILT DO SO
THAT I SHALL NEVER FROM THEE GO
BUT BE THINE OWEN SWOREN BROTHER
WE WILL US MEDLE EACH WITH OTHER MINGLE
THAT NO MAN BE HE NE'ER SO WROTH
SHALL HAVE ONE OF US TWO BUT BOTH
AT ONES AS BESIDE HIS LEAVE DESPITE HIS DESIRE
COME WE AT MORNING OR AT EVE
BE WE CRIED OR STILL Y ROWNED QUIETLY WHISPERED
THUS SAW I FALSE AND SOOTH COMPOUNED COMPOUNDED
TOGETHER FLY FOR ONE TIDING
THEN OUT AT HOLES GAN TO WRING SQUEEZE STRUGGLE
EVERY TIDING STRAIGHT TO FAME
AND SHE GAN GIVE TO EACH HIS NAME
AFTER HER DISPOSITION
AND GAVE THEM EKE DURATION
SOME TO WAX AND WANE SOON
AS DOTH THE FAIRE WHITE MOON
AND LET THEM GO
THERE MIGHT I SEE
WINGED WONDERS FULL FAST FLEE
TWENTY THOUSAND IN A ROUT COMPANY
AS AEOLUS THEM BLEW ABOUT
AND LORD THIS HOUSE IN ALLE TIMES
WAS FULL OF SHIPMEN AND PILGRIMES 85
WITH SCRIPPES BRETFULL OF LEASINGS WALLETS BRIMFUL OF FALSEHOODS
ENTREMEDLED WITH TIDINGS TRUE STORIES
AND EKE ALONE BY THEMSELVE
AND MANY THOUSAND TIMES TWELVE
SAW I EKE OF THESE PARDONERS 86
COURIERS AND EKE MESSENGERS
WITH BOISTES CRAMMED FULL OF LIES BOXES
AS EVER VESSEL WAS WITH LYES LEES OF WINE
AND AS I ALTHERFASTE WENT WITH ALL SPEED
ABOUT AND DID ALL MINE INTENT
ME FOR TO PLAY AND FOR TO LEAR TO AMUSE AND INSTRUCT MYSELF
AND EKE A TIDING FOR TO HEAR
THAT I HAD HEARD OF SOME COUNTRY
THAT SHALL NOT NOW BE TOLD FOR ME
FOR IT NO NEED IS READILY
FOLK CAN SING IT BETTER THAN I
FOR ALL MUST OUT OR LATE OR RATH SOON
ALL THE SHEAVES IN THE LATH BARN 87
I HEARD A GREATE NOISE WITHAL
IN A CORNER OF THE HALL
WHERE MEN OF LOVE TIDINGS TOLD
AND I GAN THITHERWARD BEHOLD
FOR I SAW RUNNING EV'RY WIGHT
AS FAST AS THAT THEY HADDE MIGHT
AND EV'REACH CRIED WHAT THING IS THAT
AND SOME SAID I KNOW NEVER WHAT
AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL ON A HEAP
THOSE BEHINDE GAN UP LEAP
AND CLOMB UPON EACH OTHER FAST 88 CLIMBED
AND UP THE NOISE ON HIGH THEY CAST
AND TRODDEN FAST ON OTHERS' HEELS
AND STAMP'D AS MEN DO AFTER EELS
BUT AT THE LAST I SAW A MAN
WHICH THAT I NOT DESCRIBE CAN
BUT THAT HE SEEMED FOR TO BE
A MAN OF GREAT AUTHORITY
AND THEREWITH I ANON ABRAID AWOKE
OUT OF MY SLEEPE HALF AFRAID
REMEMB'RING WELL WHAT I HAD SEEN
AND HOW HIGH AND FAR I HAD BEEN
IN MY GHOST AND HAD GREAT WONDER
OF WHAT THE MIGHTY GOD OF THUNDER
HAD LET ME KNOW AND GAN TO WRITE
LIKE AS YE HAVE ME HEARD ENDITE
WHEREFORE TO STUDY AND READ ALWAY
I PURPOSE TO DO DAY BY DAY
AND THUS IN DREAMING AND IN GAME
ENDETH THIS LITTLE BOOK OF FAME
HERE ENDETH THE BOOK OF FAME
NOTES TO THE HOUSE OF FAME
1
ROOD THE CROSS ON WHICH CHRIST WAS CRUCIFIED ANGLO SAXON
RODE
2
WELL WORTH OF THIS THING GREATE CLERKS GREAT SCHOLARS SET
MUCH WORTH UPON THIS THING THAT IS DEVOTE MUCH LABOUR
ATTACH MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THE SUBJECT OF DREAMS

THE POET BRIEFLY REFERS TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSE OF
SOMNUS IN OVID'S METAMORPHOSES 1
XI
592 ET SEQQ WHERE
THE CAVE OF SOMNUS IS SAID TO BE PROPE CIMMERIOS NEAR THE
CIMMERIANS AND SAXO TAMEN EXIT AB IMO RIVUS AQUAE
LETHES A STREAM OF LETHE'S WATER ISSUES FROM THE BASE OF THE
ROCK
4
SEE THE ACCOUNT OF THE VISION OF CROESUS IN THE MONK'S TALE
5
THE MEANING OF THE ALLUSION IS NOT CLEAR BUT THE STORY OF THE
PILGRIMS AND THE PEAS IS PERHAPS SUGGESTED BY THE LINE FOLLOWING
TO MAKE LITHE SOFT WHAT ERST WAS HARD ST LEONARD WAS THE
PATRON OF CAPTIVES
5
CORSAINT THE CORPUS SANCTUM THE HOLY BODY OR RELICS
PRESERVED IN THE SHRINE
7
SO IN THE TEMPLE OF VENUS DESCRIBED IN THE KNIGHT'S TALE
THE GODDESS IS REPRESENTED AS NAKED FLOATING IN THE LARGE SEA
8
VULCANO VULCAN THE HUSBAND OF VENUS
9
ERED PLOUGHED LATIN ARARE ANGLO SAXON EREAN
PLOUGH
10
SOURS SOARING ASCENT A HAWK WAS SAID TO BE ON THE SOAR
WHEN HE MOUNTED ON THE SOURS OR SOUSE WHEN HE
DESCENDED ON THE PREY AND TOOK IT IN FLIGHT
11
THIS IS ONLY ONE AMONG MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH CHAUCER
DISCLAIMS THE PURSUITS OF LOVE AND THE DESCRIPTION OF HIS MANNER
OF LIFE WHICH FOLLOWS IS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT THE DISCLAIMER
WAS NO MERE MOCK HUMBLE AFFECTATION OF A GALLANT
12
THIS REFERENCE APPROXIMATELY FIXING THE DATE AT WHICH THE
POEM WAS COMPOSED POINTS CLEARLY TO CHAUCER'S DAILY WORK AS
COMPTROLLER OF THE CUSTOMS A POST WHICH HE HELD FROM 1374
TO 1386

TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
IN SEVERAL RESPECTS THE STORY OF TROILUS AND CRESSIDA MAY BE
REGARDED AS CHAUCER'S NOBLEST POEM
LARGER IN SCALE THAN ANY
OTHER OF HIS INDIVIDUAL WORKS NUMBERING NEARLY HALF AS MANY
LINES AS THE CANTERBURY TALES CONTAIN WITHOUT RECKONING THE
TWO IN PROSE THE CONCEPTION OF THE POEM IS YET SO CLOSELY AND
HARMONIOUSLY WORKED OUT THAT ALL THE PARTS ARE PERFECTLY
BALANCED AND FROM FIRST TO LAST SCARCELY A SINGLE LINE IS
SUPERFLUOUS OR MISPLACED
THE FINISH AND BEAUTY OF THE POEM AS
A WORK OF ART ARE NOT MORE CONSPICUOUS THAN THE KNOWLEDGE OF
HUMAN NATURE DISPLAYED IN THE PORTRAITS OF THE PRINCIPAL
CHARACTERS
THE RESULT IS THAT THE POEM IS MORE MODERN IN FORM
AND IN SPIRIT THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER WORK OF ITS AUTHOR THE
CHASTE STYLE AND SEDULOUS POLISH OF THE STANZAS ADMIT OF EASY
CHANGE INTO THE FORMS OF SPEECH NOW CURRENT IN ENGLAND WHILE
THE ANALYTICAL AND SUBJECTIVE CHARACTER OF THE WORK GIVES IT FOR
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY READER AN INTEREST OF THE SAME KIND AS
THAT INSPIRED SAY BY GEORGE ELIOT'S WONDERFUL STUDY OF
CHARACTER IN ROMOLA THEN ABOVE ALL TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
IS DISTINGUISHED BY A PURITY AND ELEVATION OF MORAL TONE THAT
MAY SURPRISE THOSE WHO JUDGE OF CHAUCER ONLY BY THE COARSE
TRAITS OF HIS TIME PRESERVED IN THE CANTERBURY TALES OR WHO
MAY EXPECT TO FIND HERE THE TROILUS THE CRESSIDA AND THE
PANDARUS OF SHAKSPEARE'S PLAY
IT IS TO NO TRIVIAL GALLANT NO
WOMAN OF COARSE MIND AND EASY VIRTUE NO MALIGNANTLY
SUBSERVIENT AND UTTERLY DEBASED PROCURER THAT CHAUCER
INTRODUCES US
HIS TROILUS IS A NOBLE SENSITIVE GENEROUS PURE
SOULED MANLY MAGNANIMOUS HERO WHO IS ONLY CONFIRMED AND
STIMULATED IN ALL VIRTUE BY HIS LOVE WHO LIVES FOR HIS LADY AND
DIES FOR HER FALSEHOOD IN A LOFTY AND CHIVALROUS FASHION
HIS
CRESSIDA IS A STATELY SELF CONTAINED VIRTUOUS TENDER HEARTED
WOMAN WHO LOVES WITH ALL THE PURE STRENGTH AND TRUSTFUL
ABANDONMENT OF A GENEROUS AND EXALTED NATURE AND WHO IS
DRIVEN TO INFIDELITY PERHAPS EVEN LESS BY PRESSURE OF
CIRCUMSTANCES THAN BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HER LOVE WHICH WILL GO
ON LOVING LOVING WHAT IT CAN HAVE WHEN THAT WHICH IT WOULD
RATHER HAVE IS FOR THE TIME UNATTAINABLE
HIS PANDARUS IS A
GENTLEMAN THOUGH A GENTLEMAN WITH A FLAW IN HIM A MAN WHO
IN HIS COURTIER LIKE GOOD NATURE PLACES THE CLAIMS OF
COMRADESHIP ABOVE THOSE OF HONOUR AND PLOTS AWAY THE VIRTUE
OF HIS NIECE THAT HE MAY APPEASE THE LOVE SORROW OF HIS FRIEND
ALL THE TIME CONSCIOUS THAT HE IS NOT ACTING AS A GENTLEMAN
SHOULD AND DESIROUS THAT OTHERS SHOULD GIVE HIM THAT
JUSTIFICATION WHICH HE CAN GET BUT FEEBLY AND DIFFIDENTLY IN
HIMSELF
IN FACT THE TROILUS AND CRESSIDA OF CHAUCER IS THE
TROILUS AND CRESSIDA OF SHAKESPEARE TRANSFIGURED THE
ATMOSPHERE THE COLOUR THE SPIRIT ARE WHOLLY DIFFERENT THE OLDER
POET PRESENTS US IN THE CHIEF CHARACTERS TO NOBLE NATURES THE
YOUNGER TO IGNOBLE NATURES IN ALL THE CHARACTERS AND THE POEM
WITH WHICH WE HAVE NOW TO DO STANDS AT THIS DAY AMONG THE
NOBLEST EXPOSITIONS OF LOVE'S WORKINGS IN THE HUMAN HEART AND
LIFE
IT IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE BOOKS CONTAINING ALTOGETHER 8246
LINES
THE FIRST BOOK 1092 LINES TELLS HOW CALCHAS PRIEST OF
APOLLO QUITTING BELEAGUERED TROY LEFT THERE HIS ONLY DAUGHTER
CRESSIDA HOW TROILUS THE YOUNGEST BROTHER OF HECTOR AND SON
OF KING PRIAM FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AT FIRST SIGHT AT A FESTIVAL IN
THE TEMPLE OF PALLAS AND SORROWED BITTERLY FOR HER LOVE AND
HOW HIS FRIEND CRESSIDA'S UNCLE PANDARUS COMFORTED HIM BY
THE PROMISE OF AID IN HIS SUIT
THE SECOND BOOK 1757 LINES
RELATES THE SUBTLE MANOEUVRES OF PANDARUS TO INDUCE CRESSIDA TO
RETURN THE LOVE OF TROILUS WHICH HE ACCOMPLISHES MAINLY BY
TOUCHING AT ONCE THE LADY'S ADMIRATION FOR HIS HEROISM AND HER
PITY FOR HIS LOVE SORROW ON HER ACCOUNT
THE THIRD BOOK 1827
LINES OPENS WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE
LOVERS ERE IT CLOSES THE SKILFUL STRATAGEMS OF PANDARUS HAVE
PLACED THE PAIR IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS UNDER HIS ROOF AND THE
LOVERS ARE HAPPY IN PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF EACH OTHER'S LOVE AND
TRUST
IN THE FOURTH BOOK 1701 LINES THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE
CEASES TO RUN SMOOTH CRESSIDA IS COMPELLED TO QUIT THE CITY IN
RANSOM FOR ANTENOR CAPTURED IN A SKIRMISH AND SHE SADLY
DEPARTS TO THE CAMP OF THE GREEKS VOWING THAT SHE WILL MAKE
HER ESCAPE AND RETURN TO TROY AND TROILUS WITHIN TEN DAYS
THE
FIFTH BOOK 1869 LINES SETS OUT BY DESCRIBING THE COURT WHICH
DIOMEDES APPOINTED TO ESCORT HER PAYS TO CRESSIDA ON THE WAY
TO THE CAMP IT TRACES HER GRADUAL PROGRESS FROM INDIFFERENCE TO
HER NEW SUITOR TO INCONTINENCE WITH HIM AND IT LEAVES THE
DESERTED TROILUS DEAD ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE WHERE HE HAS SOUGHT
AN ETERNAL REFUGE FROM THE NEW GRIEF PROVOKED BY CLEAR PROOF OF
HIS MISTRESS'S INFIDELITY
THE POLISH ELEGANCE AND POWER OF THE
STYLE AND THE ACUTENESS OF INSIGHT INTO CHARACTER WHICH MARK
THE POEM SEEM TO CLAIM FOR IT A DATE CONSIDERABLY LATER THAN THAT
ADOPTED BY THOSE WHO ASSIGN ITS COMPOSITION TO CHAUCER'S
YOUTH AND THE LITERARY ALLUSIONS AND PROVERBIAL EXPRESSIONS WITH
WHICH IT ABOUNDS GIVE AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT IF CHAUCER REALLY
WROTE IT AT AN EARLY AGE HIS YOUTH MUST HAVE BEEN PRECOCIOUS
BEYOND ALL ACTUAL RECORD
THROUGHOUT THE POEM THERE ARE
REPEATED REFERENCES TO THE OLD AUTHORS OF TROJAN HISTORIES WHO
ARE NAMED IN THE HOUSE OF FAME BUT CHAUCER ESPECIALLY
MENTIONS ONE LOLLIUS AS THE AUTHOR FROM WHOM HE TAKES THE
GROUNDWORK OF THE POEM
LYDGATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
ASSERTION THAT LOLLIUS MEANT BOCCACCIO AND THOUGH THERE IS NO
AUTHORITY FOR SUPPOSING THAT THE ENGLISH REALLY MEANT TO
DESIGNATE THE ITALIAN POET UNDER THAT NAME THERE IS ABUNDANT
INTERNAL PROOF THAT THE POEM WAS REALLY FOUNDED ON THE
FILOSTRATO OF BOCCACCIO
BUT THE TONE OF CHAUCER'S WORK IS
MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT OF HIS ITALIAN AUCTOUR AND WHILE IN
SOME PASSAGES THE IMITATION IS VERY CLOSE IN ALL THAT IS
CHARACTERISTIC IN TROILUS AND CRESSIDA CHAUCER HAS FAIRLY
THRUST HIS MODELS OUT OF SIGHT
IN THE PRESENT EDITION IT HAS BEEN
POSSIBLE TO GIVE NO MORE THAN ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF THE POEM
274 OUT OF THE 1178 SEVEN LINE STANZAS THAT COMPOSE IT BUT
PAINS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO CONVEY IN THE CONNECTING PROSE
PASSAGES A FAITHFUL IDEA OF WHAT IS PERFORCE OMITTED
THE FIRST BOOK
THE DOUBLE SORROW 1 OF TROILUS TO TELL
THAT WAS THE KING PRIAMUS' SON OF TROY
IN LOVING HOW HIS ADVENTURES FELL FORTUNES
FROM WOE TO WEAL AND AFTER OUT OF JOY AFTERWARDS

AND FOR ME PRAY ALSO THAT GOD SO DEAR
MAY GIVE ME MIGHT TO SHOW IN SOME MANNERE
SUCH PAIN OR WOE AS LOVE'S FOLK ENDURE
IN TROILUS' UNSEELY ADVENTURE UNHAPPY FORTUNE
AND PRAY FOR THEM THAT EKE BE DESPAIR'D
IN LOVE THAT NEVER WILL RECOVER'D BE
AND EKE FOR THEM THAT FALSELY BE APPAIR'D SLANDERED
THROUGH WICKED TONGUES BE IT HE OR SHE

THAT BE DESPAIRED OF THEIR LOVE'S GRACE
AND BID ALSO FOR THEM THAT BE AT EASE
IN LOVE THAT GOD THEM GRANT PERSEVERANCE
AND SEND THEM MIGHT THEIR LOVES SO TO PLEASE
THAT IT TO THEM BE WORSHIP AND PLEASANCE HONOUR AND PLEASURE
FOR SO HOPE I MY SOUL BEST TO ADVANCE
TO PRAY FOR THEM THAT LOVE'S SERVANTS BE

AS THOUGH I WERE THEIR OWEN BROTHER DEAR
NOW LISTEN ALL WITH GOOD ENTENTION ATTENTION
FOR I WILL NOW GO STRAIGHT TO MY MATTERE
IN WHICH YE SHALL THE DOUBLE SORROW HEAR
OF TROILUS IN LOVING OF CRESSIDE
AND HOW THAT SHE FORSOOK HIM ERE SHE DIED
IN TROY DURING THE SIEGE DWELT A LORD OF GREAT AUTHORITY A
GREAT DIVINE NAMED CALCHAS WHO THROUGH THE ORACLE OF
APOLLO KNEW THAT TROY SHOULD BE DESTROYED
HE STOLE AWAY
SECRETLY TO THE GREEK CAMP WHERE HE WAS GLADLY RECEIVED AND
HONOURED FOR HIS SKILL IN DIVINING OF WHICH THE BESIEGERS HOPED
TO MAKE USE
WITHIN THE CITY THERE WAS GREAT ANGER AT THE
TREASON OF CALCHAS AND THE PEOPLE DECLARED THAT HE AND ALL HIS
KIN WERE WORTHY TO BE BURNT
HIS DAUGHTER WHOM HE HAD LEFT IN
THE CITY A WIDOW AND ALONE WAS IN GREAT FEAR FOR HER LIFE
CRESSIDA WAS THIS LADY'S NAME ARIGHT
AS TO MY DOOM IN ALLE TROY CITY IN MY JUDGMENT
SO FAIR WAS NONE FOR OVER EV'RY WIGHT
SO ANGELIC WAS HER NATIVE BEAUTY
THAT LIKE A THING IMMORTAL SEEMED SHE
AS SOOTH A PERFECT HEAV'NLY CREATURE
THAT DOWN SEEM'D SENT IN SCORNING OF NATURE
IN HER DISTRESS WELL NIGH OUT OF HER WIT FOR PURE FEAR SHE
APPEALED FOR PROTECTION TO HECTOR WHO PITEOUS OF NATURE
AND TOUCHED BY HER SORROW AND HER BEAUTY ASSURED HER OF
SAFETY SO LONG AS SHE PLEASED TO DWELL IN TROY
THE SIEGE WENT
ON BUT THEY OF TROY DID NOT NEGLECT THE HONOUR AND WORSHIP OF
THEIR DEITIES MOST OF ALL OF THE RELIC HIGHT PALLADION 4 THAT
WAS THEIR TRUST ABOVEN EV'RY ONE IN APRIL WHEN CLOTHED IS THE

AND AFTER THAT HER LOOKING GAN SHE LIGHT HER EXPRESSION BECAME
THAT NEVER THOUGHT HIM SEE SO GOOD A SIGHT
MORE PLEASANT
AND OF HER LOOK IN HIM THERE GAN TO QUICKEN
SO GREAT DESIRE AND STRONG AFFECTION
THAT IN HIS HEARTE'S BOTTOM GAN TO STICKEN
OF HER THE FIX'D AND DEEP IMPRESSION
AND THOUGH HE ERST HAD PORED UP AND DOWN PREVIOUSLY LOOKED
THEN WAS HE GLAD HIS HORNES IN TO SHRINK
UNNETHES WIST HE HOW TO LOOK OR WINK
SCARCELY
LO HE THAT HELD HIMSELFE SO CUNNING
AND SCORNED THEM THAT LOVE'S PAINES DRIEN SUFFER
WAS FULL UNWARE THAT LOVE HAD HIS DWELLING
WITHIN THE SUBTILE STREAMES OF HER EYEN RAYS GLANCES
THAT SUDDENLY HE THOUGHT HE FELTE DIEN
RIGHT WITH HER LOOK THE SPIRIT IN HIS HEART
BLESSED BE LOVE THAT THUS CAN FOLK CONVERT
SHE THUS IN BLACK LOOKING TO TROILUS
OVER ALL THINGS HE STOODE TO BEHOLD
BUT HIS DESIRE NOR WHEREFORE HE STOOD THUS
HE NEITHER CHEERE MADE NOR WORDE TOLD SHOWED BY HIS COUNTENANCE
BUT FROM AFAR HIS MANNER FOR TO HOLD TO OBSERVE DUE COURTESY
ON OTHER THINGS SOMETIMES HIS LOOK HE CAST
AND EFT 7 ON HER WHILE THAT THE SERVICE LAST AGAIN LASTED
AND AFTER THIS NOT FULLY ALL AWHAPED DAUNTED
OUT OF THE TEMPLE ALL EASILY BE WENT
REPENTING HIM THAT EVER HE HAD JAPED JESTED
OF LOVE'S FOLK LEST FULLY THE DESCENT
OF SCORN FELL ON HIMSELF BUT WHAT HE MEANT
LEST IT WERE WIST ON ANY MANNER SIDE
HIS WOE HE GAN DISSEMBLE AND EKE HIDE
RETURNING TO HIS PALACE HE BEGINS HYPOCRITICALLY TO SMILE AND
JEST AT LOVE'S SERVANTS AND THEIR PAINS BUT BY AND BY HE HAS TO
DISMISS HIS ATTENDANTS FEIGNING OTHER BUSY NEEDS THEN ALONE
IN HIS CHAMBER HE BEGINS TO GROAN AND SIGH AND CALL UP AGAIN
CRESSIDA'S FORM AS HE SAW HER IN THE TEMPLE MAKING A MIRROR
OF HIS MIND IN WHICH HE SAW ALL WHOLLY HER FIGURE HE THINKS NO
TRAVAIL OR SORROW TOO HIGH A PRICE FOR THE LOVE OF SUCH A GOODLY
WOMAN AND FULL UNADVISED OF HIS WOE COMING
THUS TOOK HE PURPOSE LOVE'S CRAFT TO SUE FOLLOW
AND THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD WORK ALL PRIVILY
FIRST FOR TO HIDE HIS DESIRE ALL IN MEW IN A CAGE SECRETLY
FROM EVERY WIGHT Y BORN ALL UTTERLY
BUT HE MIGHT AUGHT RECOVER'D BE THEREBY UNLESS HE GAINED BY IT
REMEMB'RING HIM THAT LOVE TOO WIDE Y BLOW TOO MUCH SPOKEN OF
YIELDS BITTER FRUIT ALTHOUGH SWEET SEED BE SOW
AND OVER ALL THIS MUCHE MORE HE THOUGHT
WHAT THING TO SPEAK AND WHAT TO HOLDEN IN
AND WHAT TO ARTEN HER TO LOVE HE SOUGHT CONSTRAIN 8
AND ON A SONG ANON RIGHT TO BEGIN
AND GAN LOUD ON HIS SORROW FOR TO WIN OVERCOME
FOR WITH GOOD HOPE HE GAN THUS TO ASSENT RESOLVE
CRESSIDA FOR TO LOVE AND NOT REPENT
THE SONG OF TROILUS

IF NO LOVE IS O GOD WHY FEEL I SO
AND IF LOVE IS WHAT THING AND WHICH IS HE
IF LOVE BE GOOD FROM WHENCE COMETH MY WOE
IF IT BE WICK' A WONDER THINKETH ME
WHENCE EV'RY TORMENT AND ADVERSITY
THAT COMES OF LOVE MAY TO ME SAVOURY THINK SEEM ACCEPTABLE TO ME
FOR MORE I THIRST THE MORE THAT I DRINK
AND IF I AT MINE OWEN LUSTE BREN BURN BY MY OWN WILL
FROM WHENCE COMETH MY WAILING AND MY PLAINT
IF MAUGRE ME 10 WHERETO PLAIN I THEN TO WHAT AVAIL DO I COMPLAIN
I WOT NER WHY UNWEARY THAT I FAINT
NEITHER
O QUICKE DEATH O SWEETE HARM SO QUAINT STRANGE
HOW MAY I SEE IN ME SUCH QUANTITY
BUT IF THAT I CONSENT THAT SO IT BE
AND IF THAT I CONSENT I WRONGFULLY
COMPLAIN Y WIS THUS PUSHED TO AND FRO
ALL STARRELESS WITHIN A BOAT AM I
MIDDES THE SEA BETWIXTE WINDES TWO
THAT IN CONTRARY STANDEN EVERMO'
ALAS WHAT WONDER IS THIS MALADY
FOR HEAT OF COLD FOR COLD OF HEAT I DIE
DEVOTING HIMSELF WHOLLY TO THE THOUGHT OF CRESSIDA THOUGH HE
YET KNEW NOT WHETHER SHE WAS WOMAN OR GODDESS TROILUS IN
SPITE OF HIS ROYAL BLOOD BECAME THE VERY SLAVE OF LOVE
HE SET AT
NAUGHT EVERY OTHER CHARGE BUT TO GAZE ON HER AS OFTEN AS HE
COULD THINKING SO TO APPEASE HIS HOT FIRE WHICH THEREBY ONLY
BURNED THE HOTTER
HE WROUGHT MARVELLOUS FEATS OF ARMS AGAINST
THE GREEKS THAT SHE MIGHT LIKE HIM THE BETTER FOR HIS RENOWN
THEN LOVE DEPRIVED HIM OF SLEEP AND MADE HIS FOOD HIS FOE TILL
HE HAD TO BORROW A TITLE OF OTHER SICKNESS THAT MEN MIGHT NOT
KNOW HE WAS CONSUMED WITH LOVE
MEANTIME CRESSIDA GAVE NO
SIGN THAT SHE HEEDED HIS DEVOTION OR EVEN KNEW OF IT AND HE
WAS NOW CONSUMED WITH A NEW FEAR LEST SHE LOVED SOME OTHER
MAN
BEWAILING HIS SAD LOT ENSNARED EXPOSED TO THE SCORN OF
THOSE WHOSE LOVE HE HAD RIDICULED WISHING HIMSELF ARRIVED AT
THE PORT OF DEATH AND PRAYING EVER THAT HIS LADY MIGHT GLAD HIM
WITH SOME KIND LOOK TROILUS IS SURPRISED IN HIS CHAMBER BY HIS
FRIEND PANDARUS THE UNCLE OF CRESSIDA
PANDARUS SEEKING TO
DIVERT HIS SORROW BY MAKING HIM ANGRY JEERINGLY ASKS WHETHER
REMORSE OF CONSCIENCE OR DEVOTION OR FEAR OF THE GREEKS HAS
CAUSED ALL THIS ADO
TROILUS PITIFULLY BESEECHES HIS FRIEND TO LEAVE
HIM TO DIE ALONE FOR DIE HE MUST FROM A CAUSE WHICH HE MUST
KEEP HIDDEN BUT PANDARUS ARGUES AGAINST TROILUS' CRUELTY IN
HIDING FROM A FRIEND SUCH A SORROW AND TROILUS AT LAST CONFESSES
THAT HIS MALADY IS LOVE
PANDARUS SUGGESTS THAT THE BELOVED
OBJECT MAY BE SUCH THAT HIS COUNSEL MIGHT ADVANCE HIS FRIEND'S
DESIRES BUT TROILUS SCOUTS THE SUGGESTION SAYING THAT PANDARUS
COULD NEVER GOVERN HIMSELF IN LOVE
YEA TROILUS HEARKEN TO ME QUOTH PANDARE
THOUGH I BE NICE IT HAPPENS OFTEN SO FOOLISH
THAT ONE THAT ACCESS DOTH FULL EVIL FARE IN AN ACCESS OF FEVER
BY GOOD COUNSEL CAN KEEP HIS FRIEND THEREFRO'
I HAVE MY SELFE SEEN A BLIND MAN GO
WHERE AS HE FELL THAT LOOKE COULD FULL WIDE
A FOOL MAY EKE A WISE MAN OFTEN GUIDE
A WHETSTONE IS NO CARVING INSTRUMENT
BUT YET IT MAKETH SHARPE CARVING TOOLES
AND IF THOU KNOW'ST THAT I HAVE AUGHT MISWENT ERRED FAILED
ESCHEW THOU THAT FOR SUCH THING TO THEE SCHOOL IS
SCHOOLING LESSON
THUS OUGHTE WISE MEN TO BEWARE BY FOOLES
IF SO THOU DO THY WIT IS WELL BEWARED
BY ITS CONTRARY IS EVERYTHING DECLARED
FOR HOW MIGHT EVER SWEETNESS HAVE BEEN KNOW
TO HIM THAT NEVER TASTED BITTERNESS
AND NO MAN KNOWS WHAT GLADNESS IS I TROW
THAT NEVER WAS IN SORROW OR DISTRESS
EKE WHITE BY BLACK BY SHAME EKE WORTHINESS
EACH SET BY OTHER MORE FOR OTHER SEEMETH ITS QUALITY IS MADE
AS MEN MAY SEE AND SO THE WISE MAN DEEMETH MORE OBVIOUS BY
THE CONTRAST
TROILUS HOWEVER STILL BEGS HIS FRIEND TO LEAVE HIM TO MOURN IN
PEACE FOR ALL HIS PROVERBS CAN AVAIL NOTHING
BUT PANDARUS
INSISTS ON PLYING THE LOVER WITH WISE SAWS ARGUMENTS
REPROACHES HINTS THAT IF HE SHOULD DIE OF LOVE HIS LADY MAY
IMPUTE HIS DEATH TO FEAR OF THE GREEKS AND FINALLY INDUCES
TROILUS TO ADMIT THAT THE WELL OF ALL HIS WOE HIS SWEETEST FOE IS
CALLED CRESSIDA
PANDARUS BREAKS INTO PRAISES OF THE LADY AND
CONGRATULATIONS OF HIS FRIEND FOR SO WELL FIXING HIS HEART HE
MAKES TROILUS UTTER A FORMAL CONFESSION OF HIS SIN IN JESTING AT
LOVERS AND BIDS HIM THINK WELL THAT SHE OF WHOM RISES ALL HIS
WOE HEREAFTER MAY HIS COMFORT BE ALSO
FOR THILKE GROUND THAT BEARS THE WEEDES WICK' THAT SAME
BEARS EKE THE WHOLESOME HERBES AND FULL OFT
NEXT TO THE FOULE NETTLE ROUGH AND THICK
THE LILY WAXETH WHITE AND SMOOTH AND SOFT GROWS
AND NEXT THE VALLEY IS THE HILL ALOFT
AND NEXT THE DARKE NIGHT IS THE GLAD MORROW
AND ALSO JOY IS NEXT THE FINE OF SORROW END BORDER
PANDARUS HOLDS OUT TO TROILUS GOOD HOPE OF ACHIEVING HIS
DESIRE AND TELLS HIM THAT SINCE HE HAS BEEN CONVERTED FROM HIS
WICKED REBELLION AGAINST LOVE HE SHALL BE MADE THE BEST POST OF
ALL LOVE'S LAW AND MOST GRIEVE LOVE'S ENEMIES
TROILUS GIVES
UTTERANCE TO A HINT OF FEAR BUT HE IS SILENCED BY PANDARUS WITH
ANOTHER PROVERB THOU HAST FULL GREAT CARE LEST THAT THE CARL
SHOULD FALL OUT OF THE MOON THEN THE LOVESICK YOUTH BREAKS
INTO A JOYOUS BOAST THAT SOME OF THE GREEKS SHALL SMART HE
MOUNTS HIS HORSE AND PLAYS THE LION IN THE FIELD WHILE PANDARUS
RETIRES TO CONSIDER HOW HE MAY BEST RECOMMEND TO HIS NIECE THE
SUIT OF TROILUS
THE SECOND BOOK
IN THE PROEM TO THE SECOND BOOK THE POET HAILS THE CLEAR
WEATHER THAT ENABLES HIM TO SAIL OUT OF THOSE BLACK WAVES IN
WHICH HIS BOAT SO LABOURED THAT HE COULD SCARCELY STEER THAT IS
THE TEMPESTUOUS MATTER OF DESPAIR THAT TROILUS WAS IN BUT
NOW OF HOPE THE KALENDES BEGIN HE INVOKES THE AID OF CLIO
EXCUSES HIMSELF TO EVERY LOVER FOR WHAT MAY BE FOUND AMISS IN A
BOOK WHICH HE ONLY TRANSLATES AND OBVIATING ANY LOVER'S
OBJECTION TO THE WAY IN WHICH TROILUS OBTAINED HIS LADY'S GRACE
THROUGH PANDARUS' MEDIATION SAYS IT SEEMS TO HIM NO
WONDERFUL THING
FOR EV'RY WIGHTE THAT TO ROME WENT
HELD NOT ONE PATH NOR ALWAY ONE MANNERE
EKE IN SOME LANDS WERE ALL THE GAME Y SHENT
IF THAT MEN FAR'D IN LOVE AS MEN DO HERE
AS THUS IN OPEN DEALING AND IN CHEER
IN VISITING IN FORM OR SAYING THEIR SAWS SPEECHES
FOR THUS MEN SAY EACH COUNTRY HATH ITS LAWS
EKE SCARCELY BE THERE IN THIS PLACE THREE
THAT HAVE IN LOVE DONE OR SAID LIKE IN ALL ALIKE IN ALL RESPECTS
AND SO THAT WHICH THE POEM RELATES MAY NOT PLEASE THE READER
BUT IT ACTUALLY WAS DONE OR IT SHALL YET BE DONE
THE BOOK SETS
OUT WITH THE VISIT OF PANDARUS TO CRESSIDA
IN MAY THAT MOTHER IS OF MONTHES GLADE GLAD
WHEN ALL THE FRESHE FLOWERS GREEN AND RED
BE QUICK AGAIN THAT WINTER DEADE MADE ALIVE
AND FULL OF BALM IS FLOATING EV'RY MEAD
WHEN PHOEBUS DOTH HIS BRIGHTE BEAMES SPREAD
RIGHT IN THE WHITE BULL SO IT BETID HAPPENED
AS I SHALL SING ON MAYE'S DAY THE THRID 11
THAT PANDARUS FOR ALL HIS WISE SPEECH
FELT EKE HIS PART OF LOVE'S SHOTTES KEEN
THAT COULD HE NE'ER SO WELL OF LOVE PREACH
IT MADE YET HIS HUE ALL DAY FULL GREEN PALE
SO SHOPE IT THAT HIM FELL THAT DAY A TEEN IT HAPPENED ACCESS
IN LOVE FOR WHICH FULL WOE TO BED HE WENT
AND MADE ERE IT WERE DAY FULL MANY A WENT TURNING 12
THE SWALLOW PROGNE 13 WITH A SORROWFUL LAY
WHEN MORROW CAME GAN MAKE HER WAIMENTING LAMENTING
WHY SHE FOSHAPEN WAS AND EVER LAY TRANSFORMED
PANDARE A BED HALF IN A SLUMBERING
TILL SHE SO NIGH HIM MADE HER CHITTERING
HOW TEREUS GAN FORTH HER SISTER TAKE
THAT WITH THE NOISE OF HER HE DID AWAKE
AND GAN TO CALL AND DRESS HIM TO ARISE PREPARE
REMEMB'RING HIM HIS ERRAND WAS TO DO'N
FROM TROILUS AND EKE HIS GREAT EMPRISE
AND CAST AND KNEW IN GOOD PLIGHT WAS THE MOON FAVOURABLE ASPECT
TO DO VOYAGE AND TOOK HIS WAY FULL SOON
UNTO HIS NIECE'S PALACE THERE BESIDE
NOW JANUS GOD OF ENTRY THOU HIM GUIDE
PANDARUS FINDS HIS NIECE WITH TWO OTHER LADIES IN A PAVED
PARLOUR LISTENING TO A MAIDEN WHO READS ALOUD THE STORY OF THE
SIEGE OF THEBES
GREETING THE COMPANY HE IS WELCOMED BY
CRESSIDA WHO TELLS HIM THAT FOR THREE NIGHTS SHE HAS DREAMED OF
HIM
AFTER SOME LIVELY TALK ABOUT THE BOOK THEY HAD BEEN
READING PANDARUS ASKS HIS NIECE TO DO AWAY HER HOOD TO SHOW
HER FACE BARE TO LAY ASIDE THE BOOK TO RISE UP AND DANCE AND
LET US DO TO MAY SOME OBSERVANCE CRESSIDA CRIES OUT GOD
FORBID AND ASKS IF HE IS MAD IF THAT IS A WIDOW'S LIFE WHOM IT
BETTER BECOMES TO SIT IN A CAVE AND READ OF HOLY SAINTS' LIVES
PANDARUS INTIMATES THAT HE COULD TELL HER SOMETHING WHICH COULD
MAKE HER MERRY BUT HE REFUSES TO GRATIFY HER CURIOSITY AND BY
WAY OF THE SIEGE AND OF HECTOR THAT WAS THE TOWNE'S WALL AND
GREEKES' YERD OR SCOURGING ROD THE CONVERSATION IS BROUGHT
ROUND TO TROILUS WHOM PANDARUS HIGHLY EXTOLS AS THE WISE
WORTHY HECTOR THE SECOND SHE HAS SHE SAYS ALREADY HEARD
TROILUS PRAISED FOR HIS BRAVERY OF THEM THAT HER WERE LIEFEST
PRAISED BE BY WHOM IT WOULD BE MOST WELCOME TO HER TO BE
PRAISED
YE SAY RIGHT SOOTH Y WIS QUOTH PANDARUS
FOR YESTERDAY WHO SO HAD WITH HIM BEEN
MIGHT HAVE WONDER'D UPON TROILUS
FOR NEVER YET SO THICK A SWARM OF BEEN BEES
NE FLEW AS DID OF GREEKES FROM HIM FLEE'N
AND THROUGH THE FIELD IN EV'RY WIGHTE'S EAR
THERE WAS NO CRY BUT 'TROILUS IS HERE
NOW HERE NOW THERE HE HUNTED THEM SO FAST
THERE WAS BUT GREEKES' BLOOD AND TROILUS
NOW HIM HE HURT NOW HIM ADOWN HE CAST
AY WHERE HE WENT IT WAS ARRAYED THUS
HE WAS THEIR DEATH AND SHIELD OF LIFE FOR US
THAT AS THAT DAY THERE DURST HIM NONE WITHSTAND
WHILE THAT HE HELD HIS BLOODY SWORD IN HAND
PANDARUS MAKES NOW A SHOW OF TAKING LEAVE BUT CRESSIDA
DETAINS HIM TO SPEAK OF HER AFFAIRS THEN THE BUSINESS TALKED
OVER HE WOULD AGAIN GO BUT FIRST AGAIN ASKS HIS NIECE TO ARISE
AND DANCE AND CAST HER WIDOW'S GARMENTS TO MISCHANCE
BECAUSE OF THE GLAD FORTUNE THAT HAS BEFALLEN HER
MORE CURIOUS
THAN EVER SHE SEEKS TO FIND OUT PANDARUS' SECRET BUT HE STILL
PARRIES HER CURIOSITY SKILFULLY HINTING ALL THE TIME AT HER GOOD
FORTUNE AND THE WISDOM OF SEIZING ON IT WHEN OFFERED
IN THE
END HE TELLS HER THAT THE NOBLE TROILUS SO LOVES HER THAT WITH HER
IT LIES TO MAKE HIM LIVE OR DIE BUT IF TROILUS DIES PANDARUS
SHALL DIE WITH HIM AND THEN SHE WILL HAVE FISHED FAIR 14 HE
BESEECHES MERCY FOR HIS FRIEND
WOE WORTH THE FAIRE GEMME VIRTUELESS 15 EVIL BEFALL
WOE WORTH THE HERB ALSO THAT DOTH NO BOOT HAS NO REMEDIAL POWER
WOE WORTH THE BEAUTY THAT IS RUTHELESS MERCILESS
WOE WORTH THAT WIGHT THAT TREADS EACH UNDER FOOT
AND YE THAT BE OF BEAUTY CROP AND ROOT PERFECTION 16
IF THEREWITHAL IN YOU THERE BE NO RUTH PITY
THEN IS IT HARM YE LIVE BY MY TRUTH
PANDARUS MAKES ONLY THE SLIGHT REQUEST THAT SHE WILL SHOW
TROILUS SOMEWHAT BETTER CHEER AND RECEIVE VISITS FROM HIM THAT
HIS LIFE MAY BE SAVED URGING THAT ALTHOUGH A MAN BE SOON GOING
TO THE TEMPLE NOBODY WILL THINK THAT HE EATS THE IMAGES AND
THAT SUCH LOVE OF FRIENDS REIGNETH IN ALL THIS TOWN
CRESSIDA WHICH THAT HEARD HIM IN THIS WISE
THOUGHT I SHALL FEELE WHAT HE MEANS Y WIS TEST
NOW EME QUOTH SHE WHAT WOULD YE ME DEVISE UNCLE
WHAT IS YOUR REDE THAT I SHOULD DO OF THIS COUNSEL OPINION
THAT IS WELL SAID QUOTH HE CERTAIN BEST IT IS
THAT YE HIM LOVE AGAIN FOR HIS LOVING
AS LOVE FOR LOVE IS SKILFUL GUERDONING REASONABLE RECOMPENSE
THINK EKE HOW ELDE WASTETH EV'RY HOUR AGE
IN EACH OF YOU A PART OF YOUR BEAUTY
AND THEREFORE ERE THAT AGE DO YOU DEVOUR
GO LOVE FOR OLD THERE WILL NO WIGHT LOVE THEE
LET THIS PROVERB A LORE UNTO YOU BE LESSON TOO LATE I WAS WARE QUOTH BEAUTY WHEN IT PAST
AND ELDE DAUNTETH DANGER AT THE LAST OLD AGE OVERCOMES DISDAIN
THE KINGE'S FOOL IS WONT TO CRY ALOUD
WHEN THAT HE THINKS A WOMAN BEARS HER HIGH
'SO LONGE MAY YE LIVEN AND ALL PROUD
TILL CROWES' FEET BE WOX UNDER YOUR EYE GROWN
AND SEND YOU THEN A MIRROR IN TO PRY TO LOOK IN
IN WHICH YE MAY YOUR FACE SEE A MORROW IN THE MORNING
I KEEP THEN WISHE YOU NO MORE SORROW I CARE TO WISH YOU
NOTHING WORSE
WEEPING CRESSIDA REPROACHES HER UNCLE FOR GIVING HER SUCH
COUNSEL WHEREUPON PANDARUS STARTING UP THREATENS TO KILL
HIMSELF AND WOULD FAIN DEPART BUT THAT HIS NIECE DETAINS HIM
AND WITH MUCH RELUCTANCE PROMISES TO MAKE TROILUS GOOD
CHEER IN HONOUR INVITED BY CRESSIDA TO TELL HOW FIRST HE KNOW
HER LOVER'S WOE PANDARUS THEN RELATES TWO SOLILOQUIES WHICH HE
HAD ACCIDENTALLY OVERHEARD AND IN WHICH TROILUS HAD POURED
OUT ALL THE SORROW OF HIS PASSION
WITH THIS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND HOME HE WENT
AH LORD SO WAS HE GLAD AND WELL BEGONE HAPPY
CRESSIDE AROSE NO LONGER WOULD SHE STENT STAY
BUT STRAIGHT INTO HER CHAMBER WENT ANON
AND SAT HER DOWN AS STILL AS ANY STONE
AND EV'RY WORD GAN UP AND DOWN TO WIND
THAT HE HAD SAID AS IT CAME TO HER MIND
AND WAX'D SOMEDEAL ASTONISH'D IN HER THOUGHT
RIGHT FOR THE NEWE CASE BUT WHEN THAT SHE
WAS FULL ADVISED THEN SHE FOUND RIGHT NAUGHT HAD FULLY CONSIDERED
OF PERIL WHY SHE SHOULD AFEARED BE
FOR A MAN MAY LOVE OF POSSIBILITY
A WOMAN SO THAT HIS HEART MAY TO BREST BREAK UTTERLY
AND SHE NOT LOVE AGAIN BUT IF HER LEST UNLESS IT SO PLEASE HER
BUT AS SHE SAT ALONE AND THOUGHTE THUS
IN FIELD AROSE A SKIRMISH ALL WITHOUT
AND MEN CRIED IN THE STREET THEN
TROILUS HATH RIGHT NOW PUT TO FLIGHT THE GREEKES' ROUT HOST
WITH THAT GAN ALL THE MEINIE FOR TO SHOUT CRESSIDA'S HOUSEHOLD
AH GO WE SEE CAST UP THE LATTICE WIDE
FOR THROUGH THIS STREET HE MUST TO PALACE RIDE
FOR OTHER WAY IS FROM THE GATES NONE

WITH THAT CAME HE AND ALL HIS FOLK ANON
AN EASY PACE RIDING IN ROUTES TWAIN TWO TROOPS
RIGHT AS HIS HAPPY DAY WAS SOOTH TO SAYN GOOD FORTUNE 20
FOR WHICH MEN SAY MAY NOT DISTURBED BE
WHAT SHALL BETIDEN OF NECESSITY
HAPPEN
THIS TROILUS SAT UPON HIS BAY STEED
ALL ARMED SAVE HIS HEAD FULL RICHELY
AND WOUNDED WAS HIS HORSE AND GAN TO BLEED
FOR WHICH HE RODE A PACE FULL SOFTELY
BUT SUCH A KNIGHTLY SIGHTE TRULY ASPECT
AS WAS ON HIM WAS NOT WITHOUTE FAIL
TO LOOK ON MARS THAT GOD IS OF BATTAILE
SO LIKE A MAN OF ARMES AND A KNIGHT
HE WAS TO SEE FULL FILL'D OF HIGH PROWESS
FOR BOTH HE HAD A BODY AND A MIGHT
TO DO THAT THING AS WELL AS HARDINESS COURAGE
AND EKE TO SEE HIM IN HIS GEAR HIM DRESS ARMOUR
SO FRESH SO YOUNG SO WIELDY SEEMED HE ACTIVE
IT WAS A HEAVEN ON HIM FOR TO SEE LOOK
HIS HELMET WAS TO HEWN IN TWENTY PLACES
THAT BY A TISSUE HUNG HIS BACK BEHIND RIBAND
HIS SHIELD TO DASHED WAS WITH SWORDS AND MACES
IN WHICH MEN MIGHT MANY AN ARROW FIND
THAT THIRLED HAD BOTH HORN AND NERVE AND RIND 21 PIERCED
AND AY THE PEOPLE CRIED HERE COMES OUR JOY
AND NEXT HIS BROTHER 22 HOLDER UP OF TROY
FOR WHICH HE WAX'D A LITTLE RED FOR SHAME
WHEN HE SO HEARD THE PEOPLE ON HIM CRYEN
THAT TO BEHOLD IT WAS A NOBLE GAME
HOW SOBERLY HE CAST ADOWN HIS EYEN
CRESSIDE ANON GAN ALL HIS CHEER ESPIEN
AND LET IT IN HER HEART SO SOFTLY SINK
THAT TO HERSELF SHE SAID WHO GIVES ME DRINK 23
FOR OF HER OWEN THOUGHT SHE WAX'D ALL RED
REMEMB'RING HER RIGHT THUS LO THIS IS HE
WHICH THAT MINE UNCLE SWEARS HE MIGHT BE DEAD
BUT I ON HIM HAVE MERCY AND PITY UNLESS

FOR MINE ESTATE AND ALSO FOR HIS HEAL REPUTATION HEALTH
EKE WELL I WOT MY KINGE'S SON IS HE KNOW
AND SINCE HE HATH TO SEE ME SUCH DELIGHT

AND THOUGH THAT I MINE HEARTE SET AT REST

BY ALL RIGHT I MAY DO TO ME NO SHAME
BUT RIGHT AS WHEN THE SUNNE SHINETH BRIGHT
IN MARCH THAT CHANGETH OFTENTIME HIS FACE
AND THAT A CLOUD IS PUT WITH WIND TO FLIGHT
WHICH OVERSPREADS THE SUN AS FOR A SPACE
A CLOUDY THOUGHT GAN THROUGH HER HEARTE PACE PASS
THAT OVERSPREAD HER BRIGHTE THOUGHTES ALL
SO THAT FOR FEAR ALMOST SHE GAN TO FALL
THE CLOUDY THOUGHT IS OF THE LOSS OF LIBERTY AND SECURITY THE
STORMY LIFE AND THE MALICE OF WICKED TONGUES THAT LOVE ENTAILS
BUT AFTER THAT HER THOUGHT BEGAN TO CLEAR
AND SAIDE HE THAT NOTHING UNDERTAKES
NOTHING ACHIEVETH BE HIM LOTH OR DEAR UNWILLING OR DESIROUS
AND WITH ANOTHER THOUGHT HER HEARTE QUAKES
THEN SLEEPETH HOPE AND AFTER DREAD AWAKES
NOW HOT NOW COLD BUT THUS BETWIXT THE TWAY TWO
SHE RIST HER UP AND WENTE FORTH TO PLAY ROSE TAKE RECREATION
ADOWN THE STAIR ANON RIGHT THEN SHE WENT
INTO A GARDEN WITH HER NIECES THREE
AND UP AND DOWN THEY MADE MANY A WENT WINDING TURN 12
FLEXIPPE AND SHE TARKE ANTIGONE
TO PLAYE THAT IT JOY WAS FOR TO SEE
AND OTHER OF HER WOMEN A GREAT ROUT TROOP
HER FOLLOW'D IN THE GARDEN ALL ABOUT
THIS YARD WAS LARGE AND RAILED THE ALLEYS
AND SHADOW'D WELL WITH BLOSSOMY BOUGHES GREEN
AND BENCHED NEW AND SANDED ALL THE WAYS
IN WHICH SHE WALKED ARM AND ARM BETWEEN
TILL AT THE LAST ANTIGONE THE SHEEN BRIGHT LOVELY
GAN ON A TROJAN LAY TO SINGE CLEAR
THAT IT A HEAVEN WAS HER VOICE TO HEAR
ANTIGONE'S SONG IS OF VIRTUOUS LOVE FOR A NOBLE OBJECT AND IT IS
SINGULARLY FITTED TO DEEPEN THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE MIND OF
CRESSIDA BY THE BRAVE ASPECT OF TROILUS AND BY HER OWN
COGITATIONS
THE SINGER HAVING PRAISED THE LOVER AND REBUKED
THE REVILERS OF LOVE PROCEEDS
WHAT IS THE SUNNE WORSE OF HIS KIND RIGHT TRUE NATURE
THOUGH THAT A MAN FOR FEEBLENESS OF EYEN
MAY NOT ENDURE TO SEE ON IT FOR BRIGHT 27
OR LOVE THE WORSE THO' WRETCHES ON IT CRYEN
NO WEAL IS WORTH THAT MAY NO SORROW DRIEN 28 HAPPINESS ENDURE
AND FORTHY WHO THAT HATH A HEAD OF VERRE THEREFORE GLASS 29
FROM CAST OF STONES WARE HIM IN THE WERRE
30
BUT I WITH ALL MY HEART AND ALL MY MIGHT
AS I HAVE LOV'D WILL LOVE UNTO MY LAST
MY DEARE HEART AND ALL MY OWEN KNIGHT
IN WHICH MY HEART Y GROWEN IS SO FAST
AND HIS IN ME THAT IT SHALL EVER LAST
ALL DREAD I FIRST TO LOVE HIM BEGIN ALTHOUGH I FEARED
NOW WOT I WELL THERE IS NO PAIN THEREIN
CRESSIDA SIGHS AND ASKS ANTIGONE WHETHER THERE IS SUCH BLISS
AMONG THESE LOVERS AS THEY CAN FAIR ENDITE ANTIGONE REPLIES
CONFIDENTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND CRESSIDA ANSWERS NOTHING
BUT EVERY WORDE WHICH SHE HEARD SHE GAN TO PRINTEN IN HER
HEARTE FAST NIGHT DRAWS ON
THE DAYE'S HONOUR AND THE HEAVEN'S EYE
THE NIGHTE'S FOE ALL THIS CALL I THE SUN
GAN WESTREN FAST AND DOWNWARD FOR TO WRY GO WEST 31 TURN
AS HE THAT HAD HIS DAYE'S COURSE Y RUN
AND WHITE THINGES GAN TO WAXE DUN
FOR LACK OF LIGHT AND STARRES TO APPEAR
THEN SHE AND ALL HER FOLK WENT HOME IN FERE IN COMPANY
SO WHEN IT LIKED HER TO GO TO REST
AND VOIDED WERE THOSE THAT VOIDEN OUGHT GONE OUT OF THE HOUSE
SHE SAIDE THAT TO SLEEPE WELL HER LEST PLEASED
HER WOMEN SOON UNTO HER BED HER BROUGHT
WHEN ALL WAS SHUT THEN LAY SHE STILL AND THOUGHT
OF ALL THESE THINGS THE MANNER AND THE WISE
REHEARSE IT NEEDETH NOT FOR YE BE WISE
A NIGHTINGALE UPON A CEDAR GREEN
UNDER THE CHAMBER WALL WHERE AS SHE LAY
FULL LOUDE SANG AGAINST THE MOONE SHEEN
PARAUNTRE IN HIS BIRDE'S WISE A LAY PERCHANCE
OF LOVE THAT MADE HER HEARTE FRESH AND GAY
HEREAT HARK'D SHE SO LONG IN GOOD INTENT LISTENED
TILL AT THE LAST THE DEADE SLEEP HER HENT SEIZED
AND AS SHE SLEPT ANON RIGHT THEN HER METTE SHE DREAMED
HOW THAT AN EAGLE FEATHER'D WHITE AS BONE
UNDER HER BREAST HIS LONGE CLAWES SET
AND OUT HER HEART HE RENT AND THAT ANON
AND DID HIS HEART INTO HER BREAST TO GO'N CAUSED
OF WHICH NO THING SHE WAS ABASH'D NOR SMERT AMAZED NOR HURT
AND FORTH HE FLEW WITH HEARTE LEFT FOR HEART
LEAVING CRESSIDA TO SLEEP THE POET RETURNS TO TROILUS AND HIS
ZEALOUS FRIEND WITH WHOSE STRATAGEMS TO BRING THE TWO LOVERS
TOGETHER THE REMAINDER OF THE SECOND BOOK IS OCCUPIED
PANDARUS COUNSELS TROILUS TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIS MISTRESS
TELLING HER HOW HE FARES AMISS AND BESEECHING HER OF RUTH
HE WILL BEAR THE LETTER TO HIS NIECE AND IF TROILUS WILL RIDE PAST
CRESSIDA'S HOUSE HE WILL FIND HIS MISTRESS AND HIS FRIEND SITTING
AT A WINDOW
SALUTING PANDARUS AND NOT TARRYING HIS PASSAGE
WILL GIVE OCCASION FOR SOME TALK OF HIM WHICH MAY MAKE HIS
EARS GLOW
WITH RESPECT TO THE LETTER PANDARUS GIVES SOME
SHREWD HINTS

FOR IF A PAINTER WOULDE PAINT A PIKE
WITH ASS'S FEET AND HEAD IT AS AN APE 32
IT 'CORDETH NOT SO WERE IT BUT A JAPE IS NOT HARMONIOUS
TROILUS WRITES THE LETTER AND NEXT MORNING PANDARUS BEARS IT TO
CRESSIDA
SHE REFUSES TO RECEIVE SCRIP OR BILL THAT TOUCHETH SUCH
MATTERE BUT HE THRUSTS IT INTO HER BOSOM CHALLENGING HER TO
THROW IT AWAY
SHE RETAINS IT TAKES THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY OF
ESCAPING TO HER CHAMBER TO READ IT FINDS IT WHOLLY GOOD AND
UNDER HER UNCLE'S DICTATION ENDITES A REPLY TELLING HER LOVER THAT
SHE WILL NOT MAKE HERSELF BOUND IN LOVE BUT AS HIS SISTER HIM
TO PLEASE SHE WOULD AYE FAIN BE GLAD TO DO HIS HEART AN EASE
PANDARUS UNDER PRETEXT OF INQUIRING WHO IS THE OWNER OF THE
HOUSE OPPOSITE HAS GONE TO THE WINDOW CRESSIDA TAKES HER
LETTER TO HIM THERE AND TELLS HIM THAT SHE NEVER DID A THING WITH
MORE PAIN THAN WRITE THE WORDS TO WHICH HE HAD CONSTRAINED

ALL THE BELLS RING THEN WITH A WARNING TO BE READY AT HIS CALL TO
MEET AT HIS HOUSE HE PARTS THE LOVERS AND ATTENDS CRESSIDA
WHILE SHE TAKES LEAVE OF THE HOUSEHOLD TROILUS ALL THE TIME
GROANING AT THE DECEIT PRACTISED ON HIS BROTHER AND HELEN
WHEN
HE HAS GOT RID OF THEM BY FEIGNING WEARINESS PANDARUS RETURNS
TO THE CHAMBER AND SPENDS THE NIGHT WITH HIM IN CONVERSE
THE
ZEALOUS FRIEND BEGINS TO SPEAK IN A SOBER WISE TO TROILUS
REMINDING HIM OF HIS LOVE PAINS NOW ALL AT AN END
SO THAT THROUGH ME THOU STANDEST NOW IN WAY
TO FARE WELL I SAY IT FOR NO BOAST
AND KNOW'ST THOU WHY FOR SHAME IT IS TO SAY
FOR THEE HAVE I BEGUN A GAME TO PLAY
WHICH THAT I NEVER SHALL DO EFT FOR OTHER AGAIN ANOTHER
ALTHOUGH HE WERE A THOUSAND FOLD MY BROTHER
THAT IS TO SAY FOR THEE I AM BECOME
BETWIXTE GAME AND EARNEST SUCH A MEAN MEANS INSTRUMENT
AS MAKE WOMEN UNTO MEN TO COME
THOU KNOW'ST THYSELFE WHAT THAT WOULDE MEAN
FOR THEE HAVE I MY NIECE OF VICES CLEAN PURE DEVOID
SO FULLY MADE THY GENTLENESS TO TRUST NOBILITY OF NATURE
THAT ALL SHALL BE RIGHT AS THYSELFE LUST AS YOU PLEASE
BUT GOD THAT ALL WOT TAKE I TO WITNESS KNOWS EVERYTHING
THAT NEVER THIS FOR COVETISE I WROUGHT GREED OF GAIN
BUT ONLY TO ABRIDGE THY DISTRESS ABATE
FOR WHICH WELL NIGH THOU DIEDST AS ME THOUGHT
BUT GOODE BROTHER DO NOW AS THEE OUGHT
FOR GODDE'S LOVE AND KEEP HER OUT OF BLAME
SINCE THOU ART WISE SO SAVE THOU HER NAME
FOR WELL THOU KNOW'ST THE NAME YET OF HER
AMONG THE PEOPLE AS WHO SAITH HALLOW'D IS
FOR THAT MAN IS UNBORN I DARE WELL SWEAR
THAT EVER YET WIST THAT SHE DID AMISS KNEW
BUT WOE IS ME THAT I THAT CAUSE ALL THIS
MAY THINKE THAT SHE IS MY NIECE DEAR
AND I HER EME AND TRAITOR EKE Y FERE UNCLE 17 AS WELL
AND WERE IT WIST THAT I THROUGH MINE ENGINE ARTS CONTRIVANCE
HAD IN MY NIECE PUT THIS FANTASY FANCY
TO DO THY LUST AND WHOLLY TO BE THINE PLEASURE
WHY ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD UPON IT CRY
AND SAY THAT I THE WORSTE TREACHERY
DID IN THIS CASE THAT EVER WAS BEGUN
AND SHE FORDONE AND THOU RIGHT NAUGHT Y WON RUINED
THEREFORE ERE GOING A STEP FURTHER PANDARUS PRAYS TROILUS TO
GIVE HIM PLEDGES OF SECRECY AND IMPRESSES ON HIS MIND THE
MISCHIEFS THAT FLOW FROM VAUNTING IN AFFAIRS OF LOVE
OF
KIND BY HIS VERY NATURE HE SAYS NO VAUNTER IS TO BE BELIEVED
FOR A VAUNTER AND A LIAR ALL IS ONE
AS THUS I POSE A WOMAN GRANTETH ME SUPPOSE ASSUME
HER LOVE AND SAITH THAT OTHER WILL SHE NONE
AND I AM SWORN TO HOLDEN IT SECRE
AND AFTER I GO TELL IT TWO OR THREE
Y WIS I AM A VAUNTER AT THE LEAST
AND EKE A LIAR FOR I BREAK MY HEST 44 PROMISE
NOW LOOKE THEN IF THEY BE NOT TO BLAME
SUCH MANNER FOLK WHAT SHALL I CALL THEM WHAT
THAT THEM AVAUNT OF WOMEN AND BY NAME
THAT NEVER YET BEHIGHT THEM THIS NOR THAT PROMISED MUCH
NOR KNOWE THEM NO MORE THAN MINE OLD HAT LESS GRANTED
NO WONDER IS SO GOD ME SENDE HEAL PROSPERITY
THOUGH WOMEN DREADE WITH US MEN TO DEAL
I SAY NOT THIS FOR NO MISTRUST OF YOU
NOR FOR NO WISE MEN BUT FOR FOOLES NICE SILLY 45
AND FOR THE HARM THAT IN THE WORLD IS NOW
AS WELL FOR FOLLY OFT AS FOR MALICE
FOR WELL WOT I THAT IN WISE FOLK THAT VICE
NO WOMAN DREADS IF SHE BE WELL ADVISED
FOR WISE MEN BE BY FOOLES' HARM CHASTISED CORRECTED INSTRUCTED
SO PANDARUS BEGS TROILUS TO KEEP SILENT PROMISES TO BE TRUE ALL
HIS DAYS AND ASSURES HIM THAT HE SHALL HAVE ALL THAT HE WILL IN THE
LOVE OF CRESSIDA THOU KNOWEST WHAT THY LADY GRANTED THEE AND
DAY IS SET THE CHARTERS UP TO MAKE
WHO MIGHTE TELLE HALF THE JOY AND FEAST
WHICH THAT THE SOUL OF TROILUS THEN FELT
HEARING TH'EFFECT OF PANDARUS' BEHEST
HIS OLDE WOE THAT MADE HIS HEARTE SWELT FAINT DIE
GAN THEN FOR JOY TO WASTEN AND TO MELT
AND ALL THE REHEATING 46 OF HIS SIGHES SORE
AT ONES FLED HE FELT OF THEM NO MORE
BUT RIGHT SO AS THESE HOLTES AND THESE HAYES WOODS AND HEDGES
THAT HAVE IN WINTER DEADE BEEN AND DRY
REVESTE THEM IN GREENE WHEN THAT MAY IS
WHEN EV'RY LUSTY LISTETH BEST TO PLAY PLEASANT ONE WISHES
RIGHT IN THAT SELFE WISE SOOTH TO SAY
WAX'D SUDDENLY HIS HEARTE FULL OF JOY
THAT GLADDER WAS THERE NEVER MAN IN TROY
TROILUS SOLEMNLY SWEARS THAT NEVER FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT GOD
MADE UNDER SUN WILL HE REVEAL WHAT PANDARUS ASKS HIM TO KEEP
SECRET OFFERING TO DIE A THOUSAND TIMES IF NEED WERE AND TO
FOLLOW HIS FRIEND AS A SLAVE ALL HIS LIFE IN PROOF OF HIS GRATITUDE
BUT HERE WITH ALL MY HEART I THEE BESEECH
THAT NEVER IN ME THOU DEEME SUCH FOLLY JUDGE
AS I SHALL SAY ME THOUGHTE BY THY SPEECH
THAT THIS WHICH THOU ME DOST FOR COMPANY FRIENDSHIP
I SHOULDE WEEN IT WERE A BAWDERY A BAWD'S ACTION
I AM NOT WOOD ALL IF I LEWED BE I AM NOT MAD THOUGH
IT IS NOT ONE THAT WOT I WELL PARDIE I BE UNLEARNED
BUT HE THAT GOES FOR GOLD OR FOR RICHESS
ON SUCH MESSAGES CALL HIM AS THEE LUST WHAT YOU PLEASE
AND THIS THAT THOU DOST CALL IT GENTLENESS
COMPASSION AND FELLOWSHIP AND TRUST
DEPART IT SO FOR WIDEWHERE IS WIST
HOW THAT THERE IS DIVERSITY REQUER'D
BETWIXTE THINGES LIKE AS I HAVE LEAR'D
47
AND THAT THOU KNOW I THINK IT NOT NOR WEEN SUPPOSE
THAT THIS SERVICE A SHAME BE OR A JAPE SUBJECT FOR JEERING
I HAVE MY FAIRE SISTER POLYXENE
CASSANDR' HELENE OR ANY OF THE FRAPE SET 48
BE SHE NEVER SO FAIR OR WELL Y SHAPE
TELLE ME WHICH THOU WILT OF EV'RY ONE
TO HAVE FOR THINE AND LET ME THEN ALONE
THEN BESEECHING PANDARUS SOON TO PERFORM OUT THE GREAT
ENTERPRISE OF CROWNING HIS LOVE FOR CRESSIDA TROILUS BADE HIS
FRIEND GOOD NIGHT
ON THE MORROW TROILUS BURNED AS THE FIRE FOR
HOPE AND PLEASURE YET HE NOT FORGOT HIS WISE GOVERNANCE SELF
CONTROL
BUT IN HIMSELF WITH MANHOOD GAN RESTRAIN
EACH RAKEL DEED AND EACH UNBRIDLED CHEER RASH DEMEANOUR
THAT ALLE THOSE THAT LIVE SOOTH TO SAYN
SHOULD NOT HAVE WIST BY WORD OR BY MANNERE SUSPICION
WHAT THAT HE MEANT AS TOUCHING THIS MATTERE
FROM EV'RY WIGHT AS FAR AS IS THE CLOUD
HE WAS SO WELL DISSIMULATE HE COULD
AND ALL THE WHILE THAT I NOW DEVISE DESCRIBE NARRATE
THIS WAS HIS LIFE WITH ALL HIS FULLE MIGHT
BY DAY HE WAS IN MARTE'S HIGH SERVICE
THAT IS TO SAY IN ARMES AS A KNIGHT
AND FOR THE MOSTE PART THE LONGE NIGHT
HE LAY AND THOUGHT HOW THAT HE MIGHTE SERVE
HIS LADY BEST HER THANK FOR TO DESERVE
GRATITUDE
I WILL NOT SWEAR ALTHOUGH HE LAYE SOFT
THAT IN HIS THOUGHT HE N'AS SOMEWHAT DISEAS'D TROUBLED
NOR THAT HE TURNED ON HIS PILLOWS OFT
AND WOULD OF THAT HIM MISSED HAVE BEEN SEIS'D POSSESSED
BUT IN SUCH CASE MEN BE NOT ALWAY PLEAS'D
FOR AUGHT I WOT NO MORE THAN WAS HE
THAT CAN I DEEM OF POSSIBILITY
JUDGE
BUT CERTAIN IS TO PURPOSE FOR TO GO
THAT IN THIS WHILE AS WRITTEN IS IN GEST THE HISTORY OF
HE SAW HIS LADY SOMETIMES AND ALSO THESE EVENTS
SHE WITH HIM SPAKE WHEN THAT SHE DURST AND LEST DARED AND PLEASED
AND BY THEIR BOTH ADVICE AS WAS THE BEST CONSULTATION
APPOINTED FULL WARILY IN THIS NEED MADE CAREFUL PREPARATIONS
SO AS THEY DURST HOW FAR THEY WOULD PROCEED
BUT IT WAS SPOKEN IN SO SHORT A WISE SO BRIEFLY AND ALWAYS IN SUCH
IN SUCH AWAIT ALWAY AND IN SUCH FEAR VIGILANCE AND FEAR OF BEING
LEST ANY WIGHT DIVINEN OR DEVISE FOUND OUT BY ANYONE
WOULD OF THEIR SPEECH OR TO IT LAY AN EAR
THAT ALL THIS WORLD THEM NOT SO LEFE WERE THEY WANTED MORE THAN
AS THAT CUPIDO WOULD THEM GRACE SEND ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
TO MAKEN OF THEIR SPEECHES RIGHT AN END
BUT THILKE LITTLE THAT THEY SPAKE OR WROUGHT
HIS WISE GHOST TOOK AY OF ALL SUCH HEED SPIRIT
IT SEEMED HER HE WISTE WHAT SHE THOUGHT
WITHOUTE WORD SO THAT IT WAS NO NEED
TO BID HIM AUGHT TO DO NOR AUGHT FORBID
FOR WHICH SHE THOUGHT THAT LOVE ALL CAME IT LATE ALTHOUGH
OF ALLE JOY HAD OPEN'D HER THE GATE
TROILUS BY HIS DISCRETION HIS SECRECY AND HIS DEVOTION MADE
EVER A DEEPER LODGMENT IN CRESSIDA'S HEART SO THAT SHE THANKED
GOD TWENTY THOUSAND TIMES THAT SHE HAD MET WITH A MAN WHO
AS SHE FELT WAS TO HER A WALL OF STEEL AND SHIELD FROM EV'RY
DISPLEASANCE WHILE PANDARUS EVER ACTIVELY FANNED THE FIRE
SO
PASSED A TIME SWEET OF TRANQUIL AND HARMONIOUS LOVE THE ONLY
DRAWBACK BEING THAT THE LOVERS MIGHT NOT OFTEN MEET NOR
LEISURE HAVE THEIR SPEECHES TO FULFIL AT LAST PANDARUS FOUND AN
OCCASION FOR BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AT HIS HOUSE UNKNOWN TO
ANYBODY AND PUT HIS PLAN IN EXECUTION
FOR HE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION
HAD EV'RY THING THAT HERETO MIGHT AVAIL BE OF SERVICE
FORECAST AND PUT IN EXECUTION
AND NEITHER LEFT FOR COST NOR FOR TRAVAIL EFFORT
COME IF THEM LIST THEM SHOULDE NOTHING FAIL
NOR FOR TO BE IN AUGHT ESPIED THERE
THAT WISTE HE AN IMPOSSIBLE WERE HE KNEW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
THAT THEY COULD BE DISCOVERED THERE
AND DREADELESS IT CLEAR WAS IN THE WIND WITHOUT DOUBT
OF EV'RY PIE AND EVERY LET GAME 49
NOW ALL IS WELL FOR ALL THIS WORLD IS BLIND
IN THIS MATTERE BOTHE FREMD AND TAME 50 WILD
THIS TIMBER IS ALL READY FOR TO FRAME
US LACKETH NAUGHT BUT THAT WE WEETE WO'LD KNOW
A CERTAIN HOUR IN WHICH WE COME SHO'LD
51
TROILUS HAD INFORMED HIS HOUSEHOLD THAT IF AT ANY TIME HE WAS
MISSING HE HAD GONE TO WORSHIP AT A CERTAIN TEMPLE OF APOLLO
AND FIRST TO SEE THE HOLY LAUREL QUAKE OR THAT THE GODDE SPAKE
OUT OF THE TREE SO AT THE CHANGING OF THE MOON WHEN THE
WELKIN SHOPE HIM FOR TO RAIN WHEN THE SKY WAS PREPARING TO
RAIN PANDARUS WENT TO INVITE HIS NIECE TO SUPPER SOLEMNLY
ASSURING HER THAT TROILUS WAS OUT OF THE TOWN THOUGH ALL THE
TIME HE WAS SAFELY SHUT UP TILL MIDNIGHT IN A LITTLE STEW
WHENCE THROUGH A HOLE HE JOYOUSLY WATCHED THE ARRIVAL OF HIS
MISTRESS AND HER FAIR NIECE ANTIGONE WITH HALF A SCORE OF HER
WOMEN
AFTER SUPPER PANDARAS DID EVERYTHING TO AMUSE HIS
NIECE HE SUNG HE PLAY'D HE TOLD A TALE OF WADE 52 AT LAST
SHE WOULD TAKE HER LEAVE BUT
THE BENTE MOONE WITH HER HORNES PALE
SATURN AND JOVE IN CANCER JOINED WERE 53
THAT MADE SUCH A RAIN FROM HEAV'N AVAIL DESCEND
THAT EV'RY MANNER WOMAN THAT WAS THERE
HAD OF THIS SMOKY RAIN 54 A VERY FEAR
AT WHICH PANDARUS LAUGH'D AND SAIDE THEN
NOW WERE IT TIME A LADY TO GO HEN HENCE
HE THEREFORE PRESSES CRESSIDA TO REMAIN ALL NIGHT SHE COMPLIES
WITH A GOOD GRACE AND AFTER THE SLEEPING CUP HAS GONE ROUND
ALL RETIRE TO THEIR CHAMBERS CRESSIDA THAT SHE MAY NOT BE
DISTURBED BY THE RAIN AND THUNDER BEING LODGED IN THE INNER
CLOSET OF PANDARUS WHO TO LULL SUSPICION OCCUPIES THE OUTER
CHAMBER HIS NIECE'S WOMEN SLEEPING IN THE INTERMEDIATE
APARTMENT
WHEN ALL IS QUIET PANDARUS LIBERATES TROILUS AND BY
A SECRET PASSAGE BRINGS HIM TO THE CHAMBER OF CRESSIDA THEN
GOING FORWARD ALONE TO HIS NIECE AFTER CALMING HER FEARS OF
DISCOVERY HE TELLS HER THAT HER LOVER HAS THROUGH A GUTTER BY A
PRIVY WENT A SECRET PASSAGE COME TO HIS HOUSE IN ALL THIS RAIN
MAD WITH GRIEF BECAUSE A FRIEND HAS TOLD HIM THAT SHE LOVES
HORASTES
SUDDENLY COLD ABOUT HER HEART CRESSIDA PROMISES THAT
ON THE MORROW SHE WILL REASSURE HER LOVER BUT PANDARUS SCOUTS
THE NOTION OF DELAY LAUGHS TO SCORN HER PROPOSAL TO SEND HER
RING IN PLEDGE OF HER TRUTH AND FINALLY BY PITIABLE ACCOUNTS OF
TROILUS' GRIEF INDUCES HER TO RECEIVE HIM AND REASSURE HIM AT
ONCE WITH HER OWN LIPS
THIS TROILUS FULL SOON ON KNEES HIM SET
FULL SOBERLY RIGHT BY HER BEDDE'S HEAD
AND IN HIS BESTE WISE HIS LADY GRET GREETED
BUT LORD HOW SHE WAX'D SUDDENLY ALL RED
AND THOUGHT ANON HOW THAT SHE WOULD BE DEAD
SHE COULDE NOT ONE WORD ARIGHT OUT BRING
SO SUDDENLY FOR HIS SUDDEN COMING
CRESSIDA THOUGH THINKING THAT HER SERVANT AND HER KNIGHT SHOULD
NOT HAVE DOUBTED HER TRUTH YET SOUGHT TO REMOVE HIS JEALOUSY
AND OFFERED TO SUBMIT TO ANY ORDEAL OR OATH HE MIGHT IMPOSE
THEN WEEPING SHE COVERED HER FACE AND LAY SILENT
BUT NOW
EXCLAIMS THE POET
BUT NOW HELP GOD TO QUENCHEN ALL THIS SORROW
SO HOPE I THAT HE SHALL FOR HE BEST MAY
FOR I HAVE SEEN OF A FULL MISTY MORROW MORN
FOLLOWEN OFT A MERRY SUMMER'S DAY
AND AFTER WINTER COMETH GREENE MAY
FOLK SEE ALL DAY AND EKE MEN READ IN STORIES
THAT AFTER SHARPE STOURES BE VICTORIES
CONFLICTS STRUGGLES
BELIEVING HIS MISTRESS TO BE ANGRY TROILUS FELT THE CRAMP OF
DEATH SEIZE ON HIS HEART AND DOWN HE FELL ALL SUDDENLY IN
SWOON PANDARUS INTO BED HIM CAST AND CALLED ON HIS NIECE TO
PULL OUT THE THORN THAT STUCK IN HIS HEART BY PROMISING THAT SHE
WOULD ALL FORGIVE SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR THE ASSURANCE THAT
SHE WAS NOT WROTH AND AT LAST UNDER HER CARESSES HE RECOVERED
CONSCIOUSNESS TO FIND HER ARM LAID OVER HIM TO HEAR THE
ASSURANCE OF HER FORGIVENESS AND RECEIVE HER FREQUENT KISSES
FRESH VOWS AND EXPLANATIONS PASSED AND CRESSIDA IMPLORED
FORGIVENESS OF HER OWN SWEET HEART FOR THE PAIN SHE HAD
CAUSED HIM
SURPRISED WITH SUDDEN BLISS TROILUS PUT ALL IN GOD'S
HAND AND STRAINED HIS LADY FAST IN HIS ARMS
WHAT MIGHT OR MAY
THE SEELY INNOCENT LARKE SAY WHEN THAT THE SPERHAWK
SPARROWHAWK HATH HIM IN HIS FOOT
CRESSIDA WHICH THAT FELT HER THUS Y TAKE
AS WRITE CLERKES IN THEIR BOOKES OLD
RIGHT AS AN ASPEN LEAF BEGAN TO QUAKE
WHEN SHE HIM FELT HER IN HIS ARMES FOLD
BUT TROILUS ALL WHOLE OF CARES COLD CURED OF PAINFUL SORROWS 55
GAN THANKE THEN THE BLISSFUL GODDES SEVEN

THAT BITTERNESS ASSAYED WAS BEFORN TASTED 57
FOR OUT OF WOE IN BLISSE NOW THEY FLEET FLOAT SWIM

NOW IS IT BETTER THAN BOTH TWO WERE LORN 58
FOR LOVE OF GOD TAKE EV'RY WOMAN HEED
TO WORKE THUS IF IT COME TO THE NEED
CRESSIDE ALL QUIT FROM EV'RY DREAD AND TEEN PAIN
AS SHE THAT JUSTE CAUSE HAD HIM TO TRUST
MADE HIM SUCH FEAST 59 IT JOY WAS FOR TO SEE'N
WHEN SHE HIS TRUTH AND INTENT CLEANE WIST KNEW THE PURITY
AND AS ABOUT A TREE WITH MANY A TWIST OF HIS PURPOSE
BITRENT AND WRITHEN IS THE SWEET WOODBIND PLAITED AND WREATHED
GAN EACH OF THEM IN ARMES OTHER WIND EMBRACE ENCIRCLE
AND AS THE NEW ABASHED NIGHTINGALE NEWLY ARRIVED AND TIMID
THAT STINTETH FIRST WHEN SHE BEGINNETH SING STOPS
WHEN THAT SHE HEARETH ANY HERDE'S TALE THE TALKING OF A SHEPHERD
OR IN THE HEDGES ANY WIGHT STIRRING
AND AFTER SICKER OUT HER VOICE DOTH RING CONFIDENTLY
RIGHT SO CRESSIDA WHEN HER DREADE STENT HER DOUBT CEASED
OPEN'D HER HEART AND TOLD HIM HER INTENT MIND
AND MIGHT AS HE THAT SEES HIS DEATH Y SHAPEN PREPARED
AND DIEN MUST IN AUGHT THAT HE MAY GUESS FOR ALL HE CAN TELL

THUS IN THIS HEAVEN HE GAN HIM DELIGHT
AND THEREWITHAL A THOUSAND TIMES HER KIST
THAT WHAT TO DO FOR JOY UNNETH HE WIST HE HARDLY KNEW
THE LOVERS EXCHANGED VOWS AND KISSES AND EMBRACES AND
SPEECHES OF EXALTED LOVE AND RINGS CRESSIDA GAVE TO TROILUS A
BROOCH OF GOLD AND AZURE IN WHICH A RUBY SET WAS LIKE A HEART
AND THE TOO SHORT NIGHT PASSED
WHEN THAT THE COCK COMMUNE ASTROLOGER 60

THAT SHAPEN ART BY GOD THIS WORLD TO HIDE APPOINTED
AT CERTAIN TIMES WITH THY DARKE WEED ROBE
THAT UNDER IT MEN MIGHT IN REST ABIDE
WELL OUGHTE BEASTES PLAIN AND FOLKE CHIDE

THOU DOST ALAS SO SHORTLY THINE OFFICE DUTY
THOU RAKEL NIGHT THAT GOD MAKER OF KIND RASH HASTY
THEE FOR THY HASTE AND THINE UNKINDE VICE
SO FAST AY TO OUR HEMISPHERE BIND
THAT NEVER MORE UNDER THE GROUND THOU WIND TURN REVOLVE
FOR THROUGH THY RAKEL HIEING OUT OF TROY HASTING
HAVE I FORGONE THUS HASTILY MY JOY LOST
THIS TROILUS THAT WITH THESE WORDES FELT
AS THOUGHT HIM THEN FOR PITEOUS DISTRESS
THE BLOODY TEARES FROM HIS HEARTE MELT
AS HE THAT NEVER YET SUCH HEAVINESS
ASSAYED HAD OUT OF SO GREAT GLADNESS
GAN THEREWITHAL CRESSIDE HIS LADY DEAR
IN ARMES STRAIN AND SAID IN THIS MANNERE
O CRUEL DAY ACCUSER OF THE JOY
THAT NIGHT AND LOVE HAVE STOL'N AND FAST Y WRIEN CLOSELY
ACCURSED BE THY COMING INTO TROY CONCEALED
FOR EV'RY BOW'R HATH ONE OF THY BRIGHT EYEN CHAMBER
ENVIOUS DAY WHY LIST THEE TO ESPYEN
WHAT HAST THOU LOST WHY SEEKEST THOU THIS PLACE
THERE GOD THY LIGHT SO QUENCHE FOR HIS GRACE
ALAS WHAT HAVE THESE LOVERS THEE AGUILT OFFENDED SINNED AGAINST
DISPITEOUS DAY THINE BE THE PAINS OF HELL CRUEL SPITEFUL
FOR MANY A LOVER HAST THOU SLAIN AND WILT
THY PEERING IN WILL NOWHERE LET THEM DWELL
WHAT PROFF'REST THOU THY LIGHT HERE FOR TO SELL
GO SELL IT THEM THAT SMALLE SEALES GRAVE CUT DEVICES ON
WE WILL THEE NOT US NEEDS NO DAY TO HAVE
AND EKE THE SUNNE TITAN GAN HE CHIDE
AND SAID O FOOL WELL MAY MEN THEE DESPISE
THAT HAST THE DAWNING 63 ALL NIGHT THEE BESIDE
AND SUFF'REST HER SO SOON UP FROM THEE RISE
FOR TO DISEASE US LOVERS IN THIS WISE ANNOY
WHAT HOLD THY BED BOTH THOU AND EKE THY MORROW KEEP
I BIDDE GOD SO GIVE YOU BOTHE SORROW PRAY
THE LOVERS PART WITH MANY SIGHS AND PROTESTATIONS OF
UNSWERVING AND UNDYING LOVE CRESSIDA RESPONDING TO THE VOWS
OF TROILUS WITH THE ASSURANCE
THAT FIRST SHALL PHOEBUS FALLE FROM HIS SPHERE THE SUN
AND HEAVEN'S EAGLE BE THE DOVE'S FERE
AND EV'RY ROCK OUT OF HIS PLACE START
ERE TROILUS OUT OF CRESSIDA'S HEART
WHEN PANDARUS VISITS TROILUS IN HIS PALACE LATER IN THE DAY HE
WARNS HIM NOT TO MAR HIS BLISS BY ANY FAULT OF HIS OWN
FOR OF FORTUNE'S SHARP ADVERSITY
THE WORSTE KIND OF INFORTUNE IS THIS
A MAN TO HAVE BEEN IN PROSPERITY
AND IT REMEMBER WHEN IT PASSED IS 64
THOU ART WISE ENOUGH FORTHY DO NOT AMISS THEREFORE
BE NOT TOO RAKEL THOUGH THOU SITTE WARM RASH OVER HASTY
FOR IF THOU BE CERTAIN IT WILL THEE HARM
THOU ART AT EASE AND HOLD THEE WELL THEREIN
FOR ALL SO SURE AS RED IS EV'RY FIRE
AS GREAT A CRAFT IS TO KEEP WEAL AS WIN 65
BRIDLE ALWAY THY SPEECH AND THY DESIRE
FOR WORLDLY JOY HOLDS NOT BUT BY A WIRE
THAT PROVETH WELL IT BREAKS ALL DAY SO OFT
FORTHY NEED IS TO WORKE WITH IT SOFT
TROILUS SEDULOUSLY OBSERVES THE COUNSEL AND THE LOVERS HAVE
MANY RENEWALS OF THEIR PLEASURE AND OF THEIR BITTER CHIDINGS OF
THE DAY
THE EFFECTS OF LOVE ON TROILUS ARE ALTOGETHER REFINING
AND ENNOBLING AS MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE SONG WHICH HE SUNG
OFTEN TO PANDARUS
THE SECOND SONG OF TROILUS
LOVE THAT OF EARTH AND SEA HATH GOVERNANCE
LOVE THAT HIS HESTES HATH IN HEAVEN HIGH COMMANDMENTS
LOVE THAT WITH A RIGHT WHOLESOME ALLIANCE
HOLDS PEOPLE JOINED AS HIM LIST THEM GUY GUIDE
LOVE THAT KNITTETH LAW AND COMPANY
AND COUPLES DOTH IN VIRTUE FOR TO DWELL
BIND THIS ACCORD THAT I HAVE TOLD AND TELL
THAT THE WORLDE WITH FAITH WHICH THAT IS STABLE
DIVERSETH SO HIS STOUNDES ACCORDING ACCORDING TO ITS SEASONS
THAT ELEMENTES THAT BE DISCORDABLE DISCORDANT
HOLDEN A BOND PERPETUALLY DURING
THAT PHOEBUS MAY HIS ROSY DAY FORTH BRING
AND THAT THE MOON HATH LORDSHIP O'ER THE NIGHT
ALL THIS DOTH LOVE AY HERIED BE HIS MIGHT PRAISED
THAT THE SEA WHICH THAT GREEDY IS TO FLOWEN
CONSTRAINETH TO A CERTAIN ENDE SO LIMIT
HIS FLOODES THAT SO FIERCELY THEY NOT GROWEN
TO DRENCHEN EARTH AND ALL FOR EVERMO' DROWN
AND IF THAT LOVE AUGHT LET HIS BRIDLE GO
ALL THAT NOW LOVES ASUNDER SHOULDE LEAP
AND LOST WERE ALL THAT LOVE HOLDS NOW TO HEAP TOGETHER 66
SO WOULDE GOD THAT AUTHOR IS OF KIND
THAT WITH HIS BOND LOVE OF HIS VIRTUE LIST
TO CHERISH HEARTES AND ALL FAST TO BIND
THAT FROM HIS BOND NO WIGHT THE WAY OUT WIST
AND HEARTES COLD THEM WOULD I THAT HE TWIST TURNED
TO MAKE THEM LOVE AND THAT HIM LIST AY RUE HAVE PITY
ON HEARTES SORE AND KEEP THEM THAT BE TRUE
BUT TROILUS' LOVE HAD HIGHER FRUITS THAN SINGING
IN ALLE NEEDES FOR THE TOWNE'S WERRE WAR
HE WAS AND AY THE FIRST IN ARMES DIGHT EQUIPPED PREPARED
AND CERTAINLY BUT IF THAT BOOKES ERR
SAVE HECTOR MOST Y DREAD OF ANY WIGHT DREADED
AND THIS INCREASE OF HARDINESS AND MIGHT COURAGE
CAME HIM OF LOVE HIS LADY'S GRACE TO WIN
THAT ALTERED HIS SPIRIT SO WITHIN
IN TIME OF TRUCE A HAWKING WOULD HE RIDE
OR ELLES HUNT THE BOARE BEAR LIOUN
THE SMALLE BEASTES LET HE GO BESIDE 67
AND WHEN HE CAME RIDING INTO THE TOWN
FULL OFT HIS LADY FROM HER WINDOW DOWN
AS FRESH AS FALCON COMING OUT OF MEW CAGE 68
FULL READY WAS HIM GOODLY TO SALUE SALUTE
AND MOST OF LOVE AND VIRTUE WAS HIS SPEECH
AND IN DESPITE HE HAD ALL WRETCHEDNESS HE HELD IN SCORN ALL
AND DOUBTLESS NO NEED WAS HIM TO BESEECH DESPICABLE ACTIONS
TO HONOUR THEM THAT HADDE WORTHINESS
AND EASE THEM THAT WEREN IN DISTRESS
AND GLAD WAS HE IF ANY WIGHT WELL FAR'D
THAT LOVER WAS WHEN HE IT WIST OR HEARD
FOR HE HELD EVERY MAN LOST UNLESS HE WERE IN LOVE'S SERVICE
AND SO DID THE POWER OF LOVE WORK WITHIN HIM THAT HE WAS AY
ALWAYS HUMBLE AND BENIGN AND PRIDE ENVY IRE AND AVARICE
HE GAN TO FLEE AND EV'RY OTHER VICE
THE FOURTH BOOK
A BRIEF PROEM TO THE FOURTH BOOK PREPARES US FOR THE
TREACHERY OF FORTUNE TO TROILUS FROM WHOM SHE TURNED AWAY
HER BRIGHT FACE AND TOOK OF HIM NO HEED AND CAST HIM CLEAN
OUT OF HIS LADY'S GRACE AND ON HER WHEEL SHE SET UP DIOMEDE
THEN THE NARRATIVE DESCRIBES A SKIRMISH IN WHICH THE TROJANS
WERE WORSTED AND ANTENOR WITH MANY OF LESS NOTE REMAINED IN
THE HANDS OF THE GREEKS
A TRUCE WAS PROCLAIMED FOR THE
EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS AND AS SOON AS CALCHAS HEARD THE NEWS
HE CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE GREEKS TO BID A BOON HAVING
GAINED AUDIENCE HE REMINDED THE BESIEGERS HOW HE HAD COME
FROM TROY TO AID AND ENCOURAGE THEM IN THEIR ENTERPRISE WILLING
TO LOSE ALL THAT HE HAD IN THE CITY EXCEPT HIS DAUGHTER CRESSIDA
WHOM HE BITTERLY REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR LEAVING BEHIND
AND
NOW WITH STREAMING TEARS AND PITIFUL PRAYER HE BESOUGHT THEM
TO EXCHANGE ANTENOR FOR CRESSIDA ASSURING THEM THAT THE DAY
WAS AT HAND WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BOTH TOWN AND PEOPLE
THE
SOOTHSAYER'S PETITION WAS GRANTED AND THE AMBASSADORS CHARGED
TO NEGOTIATE THE EXCHANGE ENTERING THE CITY TOLD THEIR ERRAND TO
KING PRIAM AND HIS PARLIAMENT
THIS TROILUS WAS PRESENT IN THE PLACE
WHEN ASKED WAS FOR ANTENOR CRESSIDE
FOR WHICH TO CHANGE SOON BEGAN HIS FACE
AS HE THAT WITH THE WORDES WELL NIGH DIED
BUT NATHELESS HE NO WORD TO IT SEID SAID
LEST MEN SHOULD HIS AFFECTION ESPY
WITH MANNE'S HEART HE GAN HIS SORROWS DRIE ENDURE
AND FULL OF ANGUISH AND OF GRISLY DREAD
ABODE WHAT OTHER LORDS WOULD TO IT SAY
AND IF THEY WOULDE GRANT AS GOD FORBID
TH'EXCHANGE OF HER THEN THOUGHT HE THINGES TWAY TWO
FIRST FOR TO SAVE HER HONOUR AND WHAT WAY
HE MIGHTE BEST TH'EXCHANGE OF HER WITHSTAND
THIS CAST HE THEN HOW ALL THIS MIGHTE STAND
LOVE MADE HIM ALLE PREST TO DO HER BIDE EAGER TO MAKE HER STAY
AND RATHER DIE THAN THAT SHE SHOULDE GO
BUT REASON SAID HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
WITHOUT TH'ASSENT OF HER DO THOU NOT SO
LEST FOR THY WORKE SHE WOULD BE THY FOE
AND SAY THAT THROUGH THY MEDDLING IS Y BLOW DIVULGED BLOWN ABROAD
YOUR BOTHE LOVE WHERE IT WAS ERST UNKNOW PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN
FOR WHICH HE GAN DELIBERATE FOR THE BEST
THAT THOUGH THE LORDES WOULDE THAT SHE WENT
HE WOULDE SUFFER THEM GRANT WHAT THEM LEST THEY PLEASED
AND TELL HIS LADY FIRST WHAT THAT THEY MEANT
AND WHEN THAT SHE HAD TOLD HIM HER INTENT
THEREAFTER WOULD HE WORKEN ALL SO BLIVE SPEEDILY
THOUGH ALL THE WORLD AGAINST IT WOULDE STRIVE
HECTOR WHICH THAT FULL WELL THE GREEKES HEARD
FOR ANTENOR HOW THEY WOULD HAVE CRESSEIDE
GAN IT WITHSTAND AND SOBERLY ANSWER'D
SIRS SHE IS NO PRISONER HE SAID
I KNOW NOT ON YOU WHO THIS CHARGE LAID
BUT FOR MY PART YE MAY WELL SOON HIM TELL
WE USE HERE NO WOMEN FOR TO SELL ARE ACCUSTOMED
THE NOISE OF THE PEOPLE THEN UPSTART AT ONCE
AS BREME AS BLAZE OF STRAW Y SET ON FIRE VIOLENT FURIOUS
FOR INFORTUNE WOULDE FOR THE NONCE MISFORTUNE

HECTOR QUOTH THEY WHAT GHOST MAY YOU INSPIRE SPIRIT

DAN ANTENOR A WRONG WAY NOW YE CHOOSE
THAT IS SO WISE AND EKE SO BOLD BAROUN
AND WE HAVE NEED OF FOLK AS MEN MAY SEE
HE EKE IS ONE THE GREATEST OF THIS TOWN
O HECTOR LETTE SUCH FANTASIES BE
O KING PRIAM QUOTH THEY LO THUS SAY WE
THAT ALL OUR WILL IS TO FOREGO CRESSEIDE
AND TO DELIVER ANTENOR THEY PRAY'D
THOUGH HECTOR OFTEN PRAYED THEM NAY IT WAS RESOLVED THAT
CRESSIDA SHOULD BE GIVEN UP FOR ANTENOR THEN THE PARLIAMENT
DISPERSED
TROILUS HASTENED HOME TO HIS CHAMBER SHUT HIMSELF
UP ALONE AND THREW HIMSELF ON HIS BED
AND AS IN WINTER LEAVES BE BEREFT
EACH AFTER OTHER TILL THE TREE BE BARE
SO THAT THERE IS BUT BARK AND BRANCH Y LEFT
LAY TROILUS BEREFT OF EACH WELFARE
Y BOUNDEN IN THE BLACKE BARK OF CARE
DISPOSED WOOD OUT OF HIS WIT TO BRAID TO GO OUT OF HIS SENSES
SO SORE HIM SAT THE CHANGING OF CRESSEIDE
SO ILL DID HE BEAR
HE ROSE HIM UP AND EV'RY DOOR HE SHET SHUT
AND WINDOW EKE AND THEN THIS SORROWFUL MAN
UPON HIS BEDDE'S SIDE ADOWN HIM SET
FULL LIKE A DEAD IMAGE PALE AND WAN
AND IN HIS BREAST THE HEAPED WOE BEGAN
OUT BURST AND HE TO WORKEN IN THIS WISE
IN HIS WOODNESS AS I SHALL YOU DEVISE MADNESS RELATE
RIGHT AS THE WILDE BULL BEGINS TO SPRING
NOW HERE NOW THERE Y DARTED TO THE HEART PIERCED WITH A DART
AND OF HIS DEATH ROARETH IN COMPLAINING
RIGHT SO GAN HE ABOUT THE CHAMBER START
SMITING HIS BREAST AYE WITH HIS FISTES SMART PAINFULLY CRUELLY
HIS HEAD TO THE WALL HIS BODY TO THE GROUND
FULL OFT HE SWAPT HIMSELFE TO CONFOUND
STRUCK DASHED
HIS EYEN THEN FOR PITY OF HIS HEART
OUT STREAMEDEN AS SWIFTE WELLES TWAY FOUNTAINS
THE HIGHE SOBBES OF HIS SORROW'S SMART
HIS SPEECH HIM REFT UNNETHES MIGHT HE SAY SCARCELY
O DEATH ALAS WHY N'ILT THOU DO ME DEY WHY WILL YOU NOT

SHOPE ME TO BE A LIVING CREATURE SHAPED
BITTERLY REVILING FORTUNE AND CALLING ON LOVE TO EXPLAIN WHY HIS
HAPPINESS WITH CRESSICLA SHOULD BE THUS REPEALED TROILUS
DECLARES THAT WHILE HE LIVES HE WILL BEWAIL HIS MISFORTUNE IN
SOLITUDE AND WILL NEVER SEE IT SHINE OR RAIN BUT WILL END HIS
SORROWFUL LIFE IN DARKNESS AND DIE IN DISTRESS
O WEARY GHOST THAT ERREST TO AND FRO
WHY N'ILT THOU FLY OUT OF THE WOEFULEST WILT NOT

O SOULE LURKING IN THIS WOEFUL NEST
FLEE FORTH OUT OF MY HEART AND LET IT BREST BURST

FOR I LOV'D EKE THOUGH I UNWORTHY WERE
O OLD UNWHOLESOME AND MISLIVED MAN
CALCHAS I MEAN ALAS WHAT AILED THEE
TO BE A GREEK SINCE THOU WERT BORN TROJAN
O CALCHAS WHICH THAT WILL MY BANE BE DESTRUCTION
IN CURSED TIME WERT THOU BORN FOR ME
AS WOULDE BLISSFUL JOVE FOR HIS JOY
THAT I THEE HADDE WHERE I WOULD IN TROY
SOON TROILUS THROUGH EXCESS OF GRIEF FELL INTO A TRANCE IN
WHICH HE WAS FOUND BY PANDARUS WHO HAD GONE ALMOST
DISTRACTED AT THE NEWS THAT CRESSIDA WAS TO BE EXCHANGED FOR
ANTENOR
AT HIS FRIEND'S ARRIVAL TROILUS GAN AS THE SNOW AGAINST
THE SUN TO MELT THE TWO MINGLED THEIR TEARS A WHILE THEN
PANDARUS STROVE TO COMFORT THE WOEFUL LOVER
HE ADMITTED THAT
NEVER HAD A STRANGER RUIN THAN THIS BEEN WROUGHT BY FORTUNE
BUT TELL ME THIS WHY THOU ART NOW SO MAD
TO SORROW THUS WHY LI'ST THOU IN THIS WISE
SINCE THY DESIRE ALL WHOLLY HAST THOU HAD
SO THAT BY RIGHT IT OUGHT ENOUGH SUFFICE
BUT I THAT NEVER FELT IN MY SERVICE
A FRIENDLY CHEER OR LOOKING OF AN EYE
LET ME THUS WEEP AND WAIL UNTIL I DIE
70
AND OVER ALL THIS AS THOU WELL WOST THY SELVE KNOWEST
THIS TOWN IS FULL OF LADIES ALL ABOUT
AND TO MY DOOM FAIRER THAN SUCHE TWELVE IN MY JUDGMENT
AS EVER SHE WAS SHALL I FIND IN SOME ROUT COMPANY
YEA ONE OR TWO WITHOUTEN ANY DOUBT
FORTHY BE GLAD MINE OWEN DEARE BROTHER THEREFORE
IF SHE BE LOST WE SHALL RECOVER ANOTHER
WHAT GOD FORBID ALWAY THAT EACH PLEASANCE
IN ONE THING WERE AND IN NONE OTHER WIGHT
IF ONE CAN SING ANOTHER CAN WELL DANCE
IF THIS BE GOODLY SHE IS GLAD AND LIGHT
AND THIS IS FAIR AND THAT CAN GOOD ARIGHT
EACH FOR HIS VIRTUE HOLDEN IS FULL DEAR
BOTH HERONER AND FALCON FOR RIVERE
71
AND EKE AS WRIT ZAUSIS 72 THAT WAS FULL WISE
THE NEWE LOVE OUT CHASETH OFT THE OLD
AND UPON NEW CASE LIETH NEW ADVICE 73
THINK EKE THY LIFE TO SAVE THOU ART HOLD BOUND
SUCH FIRE BY PROCESS SHALL OF KINDE COLD SHALL GROW COLD BY
FOR SINCE IT IS BUT CASUAL PLEASANCE PROCESS OF NATURE
SOME CASE SHALL PUT IT OUT OF REMEMBRANCE
CHANCE
FOR ALL SO SURE AS DAY COMES AFTER NIGHT
THE NEWE LOVE LABOUR OR OTHER WOE
OR ELLES SELDOM SEEING OF A WIGHT
DO OLD AFFECTIONS ALL OVER GO OVERCOME
AND FOR THY PART THOU SHALT HAVE ONE OF THO THOSE
T'ABRIDGE WITH THY BITTER PAINE'S SMART
ABSENCE OF HER SHALL DRIVE HER OUT OF HEART
THESE WORDES SAID HE FOR THE NONES ALL ONLY FOR THE NONCE
TO HELP HIS FRIEND LEST HE FOR SORROW DIED
FOR DOUBTELESS TO DO HIS WOE TO FALL MAKE HIS WOE SUBSIDE
HE RAUGHTE NOT WHAT UNTHRIFT THAT HE SAID CARED FOLLY
BUT TROILUS THAT NIGH FOR SORROW DIED
TOOK LITTLE HEED OF ALL THAT EVER HE MEANT
ONE EAR IT HEARD AT TH'OTHER OUT IT WENT
BUT AT THE LAST HE ANSWER'D AND SAID
FRIEND THIS LEACHCRAFT OR Y HEALED THUS TO BE
WERE WELL SITTING IF THAT I WERE A FIEND RECKED
TO TRAISEN HER THAT TRUE IS UNTO ME BETRAY
I PRAY GOD LET THIS COUNSEL NEVER THE THRIVE
BUT DO ME RATHER STERVE ANON RIGHT HERE DIE
ERE I THUS DO AS THOU ME WOULDEST LEAR TEACH
TROILUS PROTESTS THAT HIS LADY SHALL HAVE HIM WHOLLY HERS TILL
DEATH AND DEBATING THE COUNSELS OF HIS FRIEND DECLARES THAT
EVEN IF HE WOULD HE COULD NOT LOVE ANOTHER
THEN HE POINTS OUT
THE FOLLY OF NOT LAMENTING THE LOSS OF CRESSIDA BECAUSE SHE HAD
BEEN HIS IN EASE AND FELICITY WHILE PANDARUS HIMSELF THOUGH
HE THOUGHT IT SO LIGHT TO CHANGE TO AND FRO IN LOVE HAD NOT DONE
BUSILY HIS MIGHT TO CHANGE HER THAT WROUGHT HIM ALL THE WOE OF
HIS UNPROSPEROUS SUIT
IF THOU HAST HAD IN LOVE AY YET MISCHANCE
AND CANST IT NOT OUT OF THINE HEARTE DRIVE
I THAT LIVED IN LUST AND IN PLEASANCE DELIGHT
WITH HER AS MUCH AS CREATURE ALIVE
HOW SHOULD I THAT FORGET AND THAT SO BLIVE QUICKLY
O WHERE HAST THOU BEEN SO LONG HID IN MEW 74 CAGE
THAT CANST SO WELL AND FORMALLY ARGUE
THE LOVER CONDEMNS THE WHOLE DISCOURSE OF HIS FRIEND AS
UNWORTHY AND CALLS ON DEATH THE ENDER OF ALL SORROWS TO COME
TO HIM AND QUENCH HIS HEART WITH HIS COLD STROKE
THEN HE DISTILS
ANEW IN TEARS AS LIQUOR OUT OF ALEMBIC AND PANDARUS IS SILENT
FOR A WHILE TILL HE BETHINKS HIM TO RECOMMEND TO TROILUS THE
CARRYING OFF OF CRESSIDA
ART THOU IN TROY AND HAST NO
HARDIMENT DARING BOLDNESS TO TAKE A WOMAN WHICH THAT LOVETH
THEE BUT TROILUS REMINDS HIS COUNSELLOR THAT ALL THE WAR HAD
COME FROM THE RAVISHING OF A WOMAN BY MIGHT THE ABDUCTION OF
HELEN BY PARIS AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BESEEM HIM TO WITHSTAND
HIS FATHER'S GRANT SINCE THE LADY WAS TO BE CHANGED FOR THE
TOWN'S GOOD
HE HAS DISMISSED THE THOUGHT OF ASKING CRESSIDA
FROM HIS FATHER BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE TO INJURE HER FAIR FAME TO
NO PURPOSE FOR PRIAM COULD NOT OVERTHROW THE DECISION OF SO
HIGH A PLACE AS PARLIAMENT WHILE MOST OF ALL HE FEARS TO PERTURB
HER HEART WITH VIOLENCE TO THE SLANDER OF HER NAME FOR HE
MUST HOLD HER HONOUR DEARER THAN HIMSELF IN EVERY CASE AS
LOVERS OUGHT OF RIGHT
THUS AM I IN DESIRE AND REASON TWIGHT TWISTED
DESIRE FOR TO DISTURBE HER ME REDETH COUNSELETH
AND REASON WILL NOT SO MY HEARTE DREADETH IS IN DOUBT
THUS WEEPING THAT HE COULDE NEVER CEASE
HE SAID ALAS HOW SHALL I WRETCHE FARE
FOR WELL FEEL I ALWAY MY LOVE INCREASE
AND HOPE IS LESS AND LESS ALWAY PANDARE
INCREASEN EKE THE CAUSES OF MY CARE
SO WELL AWAY WHY N' ILL MY HEARTE BREST WHY WILL NOT
FOR US IN LOVE THERE IS BUT LITTLE REST MY HEART BREAK
PANDARE ANSWERED FRIEND THOU MAY'ST FOR ME
DO AS THEE LIST BUT HAD I IT SO HOT PLEASE
AND THINE ESTATE SHE SHOULDE GO WITH ME RANK
THOUGH ALL THIS TOWN CRIED ON THIS THING BY NOTE
I WOULD NOT SET ALL THAT NOISE A GROAT VALUE
FOR WHEN MEN HAVE WELL CRIED THEN WILL THEY ROWN WHISPER
EKE WONDER LASTS BUT NINE NIGHTS NE'ER IN TOWN
DIVINE NOT IN REASON AY SO DEEP
NOR COURTEOUSLY BUT HELP THYSELF ANON
BET IS THAT OTHERS THAN THYSELFE WEEP BETTER
AND NAMELY SINCE YE TWO BE ALL ONE
RISE UP FOR BY MY HEAD SHE SHALL NOT GO'N
AND RATHER BE IN BLAME A LITTLE FOUND
THAN STERVE HERE AS A GNAT WITHOUTE WOUND DIE
IT IS NO SHAME UNTO YOU NOR NO VICE
HER TO WITHHOLDE THAT YE LOVETH MOST
PARAUNTRE SHE MIGHT HOLDE THEE FOR NICE PERADVENTURE FOOLISH
TO LET HER GO THUS UNTO THE GREEKS' HOST
THINK EKE FORTUNE AS WELL THYSELFE WOST
HELPETH THE HARDY MAN TO HIS EMPRISE
AND WEIVETH WRETCHES FOR THEIR COWARDICE
FORSAKETH
AND THOUGH THY LADY WOULD A LITE HER GRIEVE LITTLE
THOU SHALT THYSELF THY PEACE THEREAFTER MAKE
BUT AS TO ME CERTAIN I CANNOT 'LIEVE
THAT SHE WOULD IT AS NOW FOR EVIL TAKE
WHY SHOULDE THEN FOR FEAR THINE HEARTE QUAKE
THINK EKE HOW PARIS HATH THAT IS THY BROTHER
A LOVE AND WHY SHALT THOU NOT HAVE ANOTHER
AND TROILUS ONE THING I DARE THEE SWEAR
THAT IF CRESSIDA WHICH THAT IS THY LIEF LOVE
NOW LOVETH THEE AS WELL AS THOU DOST HER
GOD HELP ME SO SHE WILL NOT TAKE AGRIEF AMISS
THOUGH THOU ANON DO BOOT IN THIS MISCHIEF PROVIDE A REMEDY
AND IF SHE WILLETH FROM THEE FOR TO PASS IMMEDIATELY
THEN IS SHE FALSE SO LOVE HER WELL THE LASS LESS
FORTHY TAKE HEART AND THINK RIGHT AS A KNIGHT THEREFORE
THROUGH LOVE IS BROKEN ALL DAY EV'RY LAW
KITHE NOW SOMEWHAT THY COURAGE AND THY MIGHT SHOW
HAVE MERCY ON THYSELF FOR ANY AWE IN SPITE OF ANY FEAR
LET NOT THIS WRETCHED WOE THINE HEARTE GNAW
BUT MANLY SET THE WORLD ON SIX AND SEVEN 75
AND IF THOU DIE A MARTYR GO TO HEAVEN
PANDARUS PROMISES HIS FRIEND ALL AID IN THE ENTERPRISE IT IS AGREED
THAT CRESSIDA SHALL BE CARRIED OFF BUT ONLY WITH HER OWN
CONSENT AND PANDARUS SETS OUT FOR HIS NIECE'S HOUSE TO ARRANGE
AN INTERVIEW
MEANTIME CRESSIDA HAS HEARD THE NEWS AND
CARING NOTHING FOR HER FATHER BUT EVERYTHING FOR TROILUS SHE
BURNS IN LOVE AND FEAR UNABLE TO TELL WHAT SHE SHALL DO
BUT AS MEN SEE IN TOWN AND ALL ABOUT
THAT WOMEN USE FRIENDES TO VISITE ARE ACCUSTOMED
SO TO CRESSIDE OF WOMEN CAME A ROUT TROOP
FOR PITEOUS JOY AND WEENED HER DELIGHT THOUGHT TO PLEASE HER
AND WITH THEIR TALES DEAR ENOUGH A MITE NOT WORTH A MITE
THESE WOMEN WHICH THAT IN THE CITY DWELL
THEY SET THEM DOWN AND SAID AS I SHALL TELL
QUOTH FIRST THAT ONE I AM GLAD TRUELY
BECAUSE OF YOU THAT SHALL YOUR FATHER SEE
ANOTHER SAID Y WIS SO AM NOT I
FOR ALL TOO LITTLE HATH SHE WITH US BE BEEN
QUOTH THEN THE THIRD I HOPE Y WIS THAT SHE
SHALL BRINGEN US THE PEACE ON EV'RY SIDE
THEN WHEN SHE GOES ALMIGHTY GOD HER GUIDE
THOSE WORDES AND THOSE WOMANISHE THINGES
SHE HEARD THEM RIGHT AS THOUGH SHE THENNES WERE THENCE IN SOME
FOR GOD IT WOT HER HEART ON OTHER THING IS OTHER PLACE
ALTHOUGH THE BODY SAT AMONG THEM THERE
HER ADVERTENCE IS ALWAYS ELLESWHERE ATTENTION
FOR TROILUS FULL FAST HER SOULE SOUGHT
WITHOUTE WORD ON HIM ALWAY SHE THOUGHT
THESE WOMEN THAT THUS WEENED HER TO PLEASE
ABOUTE NAUGHT GAN ALL THEIR TALES SPEND
SUCH VANITY NE CAN DO HER NO EASE
AS SHE THAT ALL THIS MEANE WHILE BRENN'D
OF OTHER PASSION THAN THAT THEY WEND WEENED SUPPOSED
SO THAT SHE FELT ALMOST HER HEARTE DIE
FOR WOE AND WEARY OF THAT COMPANY
WEARINESS
FOR WHICHE SHE NO LONGER MIGHT RESTRAIN
HER TEARES THEY BEGAN SO UP TO WELL
THAT GAVE SIGNES OF HER BITTER PAIN
IN WHICH HER SPIRIT WAS AND MUSTE DWELL
REMEMB'RING HER FROM HEAV'N INTO WHICH HELL
SHE FALLEN WAS SINCE SHE FORWENT THE SIGHT LOST
OF TROILUS AND SORROWFULLY SHE SIGHT SIGHED
AND THILKE FOOLES SITTING HER ABOUT
WEENED THAT SHE HAD WEPT AND SIKED SORE SIGHED
BECAUSE THAT SHE SHOULD OUT OF THAT ROUT COMPANY
DEPART AND NEVER PLAYE WITH THEM MORE
AND THEY THAT HADDE KNOWEN HER OF YORE
SAW HER SO WEEP AND THOUGHT IT KINDENESS
AND EACH OF THEM WEPT EKE FOR HER DISTRESS
AND BUSILY THEY GONNEN HER COMFORT BEGAN
OF THING GOD WOT ON WHICH SHE LITTLE THOUGHT
AND WITH THEIR TALES WEENED HER DISPORT
AND TO BE GLAD THEY HER BESOUGHT
BUT SUCH AN EASE THEREWITH THEY IN HER WROUGHT
RIGHT AS A MAN IS EASED FOR TO FEEL
FOR ACHE OF HEAD TO CLAW HIM ON HIS HEEL
BUT AFTER ALL THIS NICE VANITY SILLY
THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE AND HOME THEY WENTEN ALL
CRESSIDA FULL OF SORROWFUL PITY
INTO HER CHAMBER UP WENT OUT OF THE HALL
AND ON HER BED SHE GAN FOR DEAD TO FALL
IN PURPOSE NEVER THENNES FOR TO RISE
AND THUS SHE WROUGHT AS I SHALL YOU DEVISE NARRATE
SHE RENT HER SUNNY HAIR WRUNG HER HANDS WEPT AND BEWAILED
HER FATE VOWING THAT SINCE FOR THE CRUELTY SHE COULD HANDLE
NEITHER SWORD NOR DART SHE WOULD ABSTAIN FROM MEAT AND DRINK
UNTIL SHE DIED
AS SHE LAMENTED PANDARUS ENTERED MAKING HER
COMPLAIN A THOUSAND TIMES MORE AT THE THOUGHT OF ALL THE JOY
WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HER WITH HER LOVER BUT HE SOMEWHAT
SOOTHED HER BY THE PROSPECT OF TROILUS'S VISIT AND BY THE
COUNSEL TO CONTAIN HER GRIEF WHEN HE SHOULD COME
THEN
PANDARUS WENT IN SEARCH OF TROILUS WHOM HE FOUND SOLITARY IN A
TEMPLE AS ONE THAT HAD CEASED TO CARE FOR LIFE
FOR RIGHT THUS WAS HIS ARGUMENT ALWAY
HE SAID HE WAS BUT LORNE WELL AWAY LOST RUINED
FOR ALL THAT COMES COMES BY NECESSITY
THUS TO BE LORN IT IS MY DESTINY
LOST RUINED
FOR CERTAINLY THIS WOT I WELL HE SAID
THAT FORESIGHT OF THE DIVINE PURVEYANCE PROVIDENCE
HATH SEEN ALWAY ME TO FORGO CRESSEIDE LOSE
SINCE GOD SEES EV'RY THING OUT OF DOUBTANCE WITHOUT DOUBT
AND THEM DISPOSETH THROUGH HIS ORDINANCE
IN THEIR MERITES SOOTHLY FOR TO BE
AS THEY SHOULD COME BY PREDESTINY
BUT NATHELESS ALAS WHOM SHALL I 'LIEVE
FOR THERE BE GREATE CLERKES MANY ONE SCHOLARS
THAT DESTINY THROUGH ARGUMENTES PREVE PROVE
AND SOME SAY THAT NEEDLY THERE IS NONE NECESSARILY
BUT THAT FREE CHOICE IS GIV'N US EV'RY ONE
O WELL AWAY SO SLY ARE CLERKES OLD
THAT I N'OT WHOSE OPINION I MAY HOLD
76 KNOW NOT
FOR SOME MEN SAY IF GOD SEES ALL BEFORN
GODDE MAY NOT DECEIVED BE PARDIE
THEN MUST IT FALLEN THOUGH MEN HAD IT SWORN BEFALL HAPPEN
THAT PURVEYANCE HATH SEEN BEFORE TO BE
WHEREFORE I SAY THAT FROM ETERN IF HE ETERNITY
HATH WIST BEFORE OUR THOUGHT EKE AS OUR DEED KNOWN
WE HAVE NO FREE CHOICE AS THESE CLERKES READ MAINTAIN
FOR OTHER THOUGHT NOR OTHER DEED ALSO
MIGHT NEVER BE BUT SUCH AS PURVEYANCE
WHICH MAY NOT BE DECEIVED NEVER MO'
HATH FEELED BEFORE WITHOUT IGNORANCE PERCEIVED
FOR IF THERE MIGHTE BE A VARIANCE
TO WRITHEN OUT FROM GODDE'S PURVEYING
THERE WERE NO PRESCIENCE OF THING COMING
BUT IT WERE RATHER AN OPINION
UNCERTAIN AND NO STEADFAST FORESEEING
AND CERTES THAT WERE AN ABUSION ILLUSION
THAT GOD SHOULD HAVE NO PERFECT CLEAR WEETING KNOWLEDGE
MORE THAN WE MEN THAT HAVE DOUBTOUS WEENING DUBIOUS OPINION
BUT SUCH AN ERROR UPON GOD TO GUESS TO IMPUTE TO GOD
WERE FALSE AND FOUL AND WICKED CURSEDNESS IMPIETY
EKE THIS IS AN OPINION OF SOME
THAT HAVE THEIR TOP FULL HIGH AND SMOOTH Y SHORE 77
THEY SAY RIGHT THUS THAT THING IS NOT TO COME
FOR THAT THE PRESCIENCE HATH SEEN BEFORE BECAUSE
THAT IT SHALL COME BUT THEY SAY THAT THEREFORE
THAT IT SHALL COME THEREFORE THE PURVEYANCE
WOT IT BEFORE WITHOUTEN IGNORANCE
AND IN THIS MANNER THIS NECESSITY
RETURNETH IN HIS PART CONTRARY AGAIN REACTS IN THE OPPOSITE
FOR NEEDFULLY BEHOVES IT NOT TO BE DIRECTION
THAT THILKE THINGES FALLEN IN CERTAIN CERTAINLY HAPPEN
THAT BE PURVEY'D BUT NEEDLY AS THEY SAYN
BEHOVETH IT THAT THINGES WHICH THAT FALL
THAT THEY IN CERTAIN BE PURVEYED ALL
I MEAN AS THOUGH I LABOUR'D ME IN THIS
TO INQUIRE WHICH THING CAUSE OF WHICH THING BE
AS WHETHER THAT THE PRESCIENCE OF GOD IS
THE CERTAIN CAUSE OF THE NECESSITY
OF THINGES THAT TO COME BE PARDIE
OR IF NECESSITY OF THING COMING
BE CAUSE CERTAIN OF THE PURVEYING
BUT NOW ENFORCE I ME NOT IN SHEWING I DO NOT LAY STRESS
HOW TH'ORDER OF CAUSES STANDS BUT WELL WOT I
THAT IT BEHOVETH THAT THE BEFALLING
OF THINGES WISTE BEFORE CERTAINLY KNOWN
BE NECESSARY ALL SEEM IT NOT THEREBY THOUGH IT DOES NOT APPEAR
THAT PRESCIENCE PUT FALLING NECESSAIR
TO THING TO COME ALL FALL IT FOUL OR FAIR
FOR IF THERE SIT A MAN YOND ON A SEE SEAT
THEN BY NECESSITY BEHOVETH IT
THAT CERTES THINE OPINION SOOTH BE
THAT WEENEST OR CONJECTEST THAT HE SIT CONJECTUREST
AND FURTHEROVER NOW AGAINWARD YET
LO RIGHT SO IS IT ON THE PART CONTRARY
AS THUS NOW HEARKEN FOR I WILL NOT TARRY
I SAY THAT IF TH'OPINION OF THEE
BE SOOTH FOR THAT HE SITS THEN SAY I THIS
THAT HE MUST SITTE BY NECESSITY
AND THUS NECESSITY IN EITHER IS
FOR IN HIM NEED OF SITTING IS Y WIS
AND IN THEE NEED OF SOOTH AND THUS FORSOOTH
THERE MUST NECESSITY BE IN YOU BOTH
BUT THOU MAY'ST SAY HE SITS NOT THEREFORE
THAT THINE OPINION OF HIS SITTING SOOTH
BUT RATHER FOR THE MAN SAT THERE BEFORE
THEREFORE IS THINE OPINION SOOTH Y WIS
AND I SAY THOUGH THE CAUSE OF SOOTH OF THIS
COMES OF HIS SITTING YET NECESSITY
IS INTERCHANGED BOTH IN HIM AND THEE
THUS IN THE SAME WISE OUT OF DOUBTANCE
I MAY WELL MAKEN AS IT SEEMETH ME
MY REASONING OF GODDE'S PURVEYANCE
AND OF THE THINGES THAT TO COME BE
BY WHICHE REASON MEN MAY WELL Y SEE
THAT THILKE THINGES THAT IN EARTHE FALL THOSE HAPPEN
THAT BY NECESSITY THEY COMEN ALL
FOR ALTHOUGH THAT A THING SHOULD COME Y WIS
THEREFORE IT IS PURVEYED CERTAINLY
NOT THAT IT COMES FOR IT PURVEYED IS
YET NATHELESS BEHOVETH NEEDFULLY
THAT THING TO COME BE PURVEY'D TRUELY
OR ELLES THINGES THAT PURVEYED BE
THAT THEY BETIDE BY NECESSITY
HAPPEN
AND THIS SUFFICETH RIGHT ENOUGH CERTAIN
FOR TO DESTROY OUR FREE CHOICE EV'RY DEAL
BUT NOW IS THIS ABUSION TO SAYN ILLUSION SELF DECEPTION
THAT FALLING OF THE THINGES TEMPOREL
IS CAUSE OF GODDE'S PRESCIENCE ETERNEL
NOW TRUELY THAT IS A FALSE SENTENCE OPINION JUDGMENT
THAT THING TO COME SHOULD CAUSE HIS PRESCIENCE
WHAT MIGHT I WEEN AN' I HAD SUCH A THOUGHT IF
BUT THAT GOD PURVEYS THING THAT IS TO COME
FOR THAT IT IS TO COME AND ELLES NOUGHT
SO MIGHT I WEEN THAT THINGES ALL AND SOME
THAT WHILOM BE BEFALL AND OVERCOME HAVE HAPPENED
BE CAUSE OF THILKE SOV'REIGN PURVEYANCE IN TIMES PAST
THAT FOREKNOWS ALL WITHOUTEN IGNORANCE
AND OVER ALL THIS YET SAY I MORE THERETO
THAT RIGHT AS WHEN I WOT THERE IS A THING
Y WIS THAT THING MUST NEEDFULLY BE SO
EKE RIGHT SO WHEN I WOT A THING COMING
SO MUST IT COME AND THUS THE BEFALLING
OF THINGES THAT BE WIST BEFORE THE TIDE TIME
THEY MAY NOT BE ESCHEW'D ON ANY SIDE AVOIDED
WHILE TROILUS WAS IN ALL THIS HEAVINESS DISPUTING WITH HIMSELF IN
THIS MATTER PANDARUS JOINED HIM AND TOLD HIM THE RESULT OF THE
INTERVIEW WITH CRESSIDA AND AT NIGHT THE LOVERS MET WITH WHAT
SIGHS AND TEARS MAY BE IMAGINED
CRESSIDA SWOONED AWAY SO
THAT TROILUS TOOK HER FOR DEAD AND HAVING TENDERLY LAID OUT HER
LIMBS AS ONE PREPARING A CORPSE FOR THE BIER HE DREW HIS SWORD
TO SLAY HIMSELF UPON HER BODY
BUT AS GOD WOULD JUST AT THAT
MOMENT SHE AWOKE OUT OF HER SWOON AND BY AND BY THE PAIR
BEGAN TO TALK OF THEIR PROSPECTS
CRESSIDA DECLARED THE OPINION
SUPPORTING IT AT GREAT LENGTH AND WITH MANY REASONS THAT THERE
WAS NO CAUSE FOR HALF SO MUCH WOE ON EITHER PART
HER
SURRENDER DECREED BY THE PARLIAMENT COULD NOT BE RESISTED IT
WAS QUITE EASY FOR THEM SOON TO MEET AGAIN SHE WOULD BRING
THINGS ABOUT THAT SHE SHOULD BE BACK IN TROY WITHIN A WEEK OR
TWO SHE WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONSTANT COMING AND
GOING WHILE THE TRUCE LASTED AND THE ISSUE WOULD BE THAT THE
TROJANS WOULD HAVE BOTH HER AND ANTENOR WHILE TO FACILITATE
HER RETURN SHE HAD DEVISED A STRATAGEM BY WHICH WORKING ON
HER FATHER'S AVARICE SHE MIGHT TEMPT HIM TO DESERT FROM THE
GREEK CAMP BACK TO THE CITY
AND TRULY SAYS THE POET HAVING
FULLY REPORTED HER PLAUSIBLE SPEECH
AND TRUELY AS WRITTEN WELL I FIND
THAT ALL THIS THING WAS SAID OF GOOD INTENT SINCERELY
AND THAT HER HEARTE TRUE WAS AND KIND
TOWARDES HIM AND SPAKE RIGHT AS SHE MEANT
AND THAT SHE STARF FOR WOE NIGH WHEN SHE WENT DIED
AND WAS IN PURPOSE EVER TO BE TRUE
THUS WRITE THEY THAT OF HER WORKES KNEW
THIS TROILUS WITH HEART AND EARS Y SPRAD ALL OPEN
HEARD ALL THIS THING DEVISED TO AND FRO
AND VERILY IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD
THE SELFE WIT BUT YET TO LET HER GO THE SAME OPINION
HIS HEARTE MISFORGAVE HIM EVERMO' MISGAVE
BUT FINALLY HE GAN HIS HEARTE WREST COMPEL
TO TRUSTE HER AND TOOK IT FOR THE BEST
FOR WHICH THE GREAT FURY OF HIS PENANCE SUFFERING
WAS QUENCH'D WITH HOPE AND THEREWITH THEM BETWEEN
BEGAN FOR JOY THE AMOROUSE DANCE
AND AS THE BIRDES WHEN THE SUN IS SHEEN BRIGHT
DELIGHTEN IN THEIR SONG IN LEAVES GREEN
RIGHT SO THE WORDES THAT THEY SPAKE Y FERE TOGETHER
DELIGHTEN THEM AND MAKE THEIR HEARTES CHEER GLAD
YET TROILUS WAS NOT SO WELL AT EASE THAT HE DID NOT EARNESTLY
ENTREAT CRESSIDA TO OBSERVE HER PROMISE FOR IF SHE CAME NOT
INTO TROY AT THE SET DAY HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE HEALTH HONOUR OR
JOY AND HE FEARED THAT THE STRATAGEM BY WHICH SHE WOULD TRY TO
LURE HER FATHER BACK WOULD FAIL SO THAT SHE MIGHT BE COMPELLED
TO REMAIN AMONG THE GREEKS
HE WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM STEAL
AWAY TOGETHER WITH SUFFICIENT TREASURE TO MAINTAIN THEM ALL THEIR
LIVES AND EVEN IF THEY WENT IN THEIR BARE SHIRT HE HAD KIN AND
FRIENDS ELSEWHERE WHO WOULD WELCOME AND HONOUR THEM
CRESSIDA WITH A SIGH RIGHT IN THIS WISE
ANSWER'D Y WIS MY DEARE HEARTE TRUE
WE MAY WELL STEAL AWAY AS YE DEVISE
AND FINDE SUCH UNTHRIFTY WAYES NEW
BUT AFTERWARD FULL SORE IT WILL US RUE WE WILL REGRET IT
AND HELP ME GOD SO AT MY MOSTE NEED
AS CAUSELESS YE SUFFER ALL THIS DREAD
FOR THILKE DAY THAT I FOR CHERISHING THAT SAME
OR DREAD OF FATHER OR OF OTHER WIGHT
OR FOR ESTATE DELIGHT OR FOR WEDDING
BE FALSE TO YOU MY TROILUS MY KNIGHT
SATURNE'S DAUGHTER JUNO THROUGH HER MIGHT
AS WOOD AS ATHAMANTE 78 DO ME DWELL MAD
ETERNALLY IN STYX THE PIT OF HELL
AND THIS ON EV'RY GOD CELESTIAL
I SWEAR IT YOU AND EKE ON EACH GODDESS
ON EV'RY NYMPH AND DEITY INFERNAL
ON SATYRS AND ON FAUNES MORE OR LESS
THAT HALFE GODDES BE OF WILDERNESS DEMIGODS
AND ATROPOS MY THREAD OF LIFE TO BREST BREAK UTTERLY
IF I BE FALSE NOW TROW ME IF YOU LEST BELIEVE PLEASE
AND THOU SIMOIS 79 THAT AS AN ARROW CLEAR
THROUGH TROY AY RUNNEST DOWNWARD TO THE SEA
BEAR WITNESS OF THIS WORD THAT SAID IS HERE
THAT THILKE DAY THAT I UNTRUE BE
TO TROILUS MINE OWEN HEARTE FREE
THAT THOU RETURNE BACKWARD TO THY WELL
AND I WITH BODY AND SOUL SINK IN HELL
EVEN YET TROILUS WAS NOT WHOLLY CONTENT AND URGED ANEW HIS
PLAN OF SECRET FLIGHT BUT CRESSIDA TURNED UPON HIM WITH THE
CHARGE THAT HE MISTRUSTED HER CAUSELESSLY AND DEMANDED OF HIM
THAT HE SHOULD BE FAITHFUL IN HER ABSENCE ELSE SHE MUST DIE AT HER
RETURN
TROILUS PROMISED FAITHFULNESS IN FAR SIMPLER AND BRIEFER
WORDS THAN CRESSIDA HAD USED
GRAND MERCY GOOD HEART MINE Y WIS QUOTH SHE
AND BLISSFUL VENUS LET ME NEVER STERVE DIE
ERE I MAY STAND OF PLEASANCE IN DEGREE IN A POSITION TO REWARD
TO QUITE HIM THAT SO WELL CAN DESERVE HIM WELL WITH PLEASURE
AND WHILE THAT GOD MY WIT WILL ME CONSERVE
I SHALL SO DO SO TRUE I HAVE YOU FOUND
THAT AY HONOUR TO ME WARD SHALL REBOUND
FOR TRUSTE WELL THAT YOUR ESTATE ROYAL RANK
NOR VAIN DELIGHT NOR ONLY WORTHINESS
OF YOU IN WAR OR TOURNEY MARTIAL
NOR POMP ARRAY NOBLEY NOR EKE RICHESS
NE MADE ME TO RUE ON YOUR DISTRESS TAKE PITY
BUT MORAL VIRTUE GROUNDED UPON TRUTH
THAT WAS THE CAUSE I FIRST HAD ON YOU RUTH PITY
EKE GENTLE HEART AND MANHOOD THAT YE HAD
AND THAT YE HAD AS ME THOUGHT IN DESPITE
EVERY THING THAT SOUNDED UNTO BAD TENDED UNTO ACCORDED WITH
AS RUDENESS AND PEOPLISH APPETITE VULGAR
AND THAT YOUR REASON BRIDLED YOUR DELIGHT
THIS MADE ABOVEN EV'RY CREATURE
THAT I WAS YOURS AND SHALL WHILE I MAY DURE
AND THIS MAY LENGTH OF YEARES NOT FORDO DESTROY DO AWAY
NOR REMUABLE FORTUNE DEFACE UNSTABLE
BUT JUPITER THAT OF HIS MIGHT MAY DO
THE SORROWFUL TO BE GLAD SO GIVE US GRACE
ERE NIGHTES TEN TO MEETEN IN THIS PLACE
SO THAT IT MAY YOUR HEART AND MINE SUFFICE
AND FARE NOW WELL FOR TIME IS THAT YE RISE
THE LOVERS TOOK A HEART RENDING ADIEU AND TROILUS SUFFERING
UNIMAGINABLE ANGUISH WITHOUTE MORE OUT OF THE CHAMBER
WENT
THE FIFTH BOOK
APPROACHE GAN THE FATAL DESTINY
THAT JOVIS HATH IN DISPOSITION
AND TO YOU ANGRY PARCAE SISTERS THREE THE FATES
COMMITTETH TO DO EXECUTION
FOR WHICH CRESSIDA MUST OUT OF THE TOWN
AND TROILUS SHALL DWELLE FORTH IN PINE PAIN
TILL LACHESIS HIS THREAD NO LONGER TWINE TWIST
THE GOLDEN TRESSED PHOEBUS HIGH ALOFT
THRIES HAD ALLE WITH HIS BEAMES CLEAR THRICE
THE SNOWES MOLT AND ZEPHYRUS AS OFT MELTED
Y BROUGHT AGAIN THE TENDER LEAVES GREEN
SINCE THAT THE SON OF HECUBA THE QUEEN TROILUS 80
BEGAN TO LOVE HER FIRST FOR WHOM HIS SORROW
WAS ALL THAT SHE DEPART SHOULD ON THE MORROW
IN THE MORNING DIOMEDE WAS READY TO ESCORT CRESSIDA TO THE
GREEK HOST AND TROILUS SEEING HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE COULD WITH
DIFFICULTY RESIST AN IMPULSE TO SLAY HIM BUT RESTRAINED HIMSELF
LEST HIS LADY SHOULD BE ALSO SLAIN IN THE TUMULT
WHEN CRESSIDA
WAS READY TO GO
THIS TROILUS IN GUISE OF COURTESY
WITH HAWK ON HAND AND WITH A HUGE ROUT RETINUE CROWD
OF KNIGHTES RODE AND DID HER COMPANY
PASSING ALLE THE VALLEY FAR WITHOUT
AND FARTHER WOULD HAVE RIDDEN OUT OF DOUBT
FULL FAIN AND WOE WAS HIM TO GO SO SOON GLADLY
BUT TURN HE MUST AND IT WAS EKE TO DO'N
AND RIGHT WITH THAT WAS ANTENOR Y COME
OUT OF THE GREEKES' HOST AND EV'RY WIGHT
WAS OF IT GLAD AND SAID HE WAS WELCOME
AND TROILUS ALL N'ERE HIS HEARTE LIGHT ALTHOUGH HIS HEART
HE PAINED HIM WITH ALL HIS FULLE MIGHT WAS NOT LIGHT
HIM TO WITHHOLD FROM WEEPING AT THE LEAST
AND ANTENOR HE KISS'D AND MADE FEAST
AND THEREWITHAL HE MUST HIS LEAVE TAKE
AND CAST HIS EYE UPON HER PITEOUSLY
AND NEAR HE RODE HIS CAUSE FOR TO MAKE EXCUSE OCCASION
TO TAKE HER BY THE HAND ALL SOBERLY
AND LORD SO SHE GAN WEEPE TENDERLY
AND HE FULL SOFT AND SLILY GAN HER SAY
NOW HOLD YOUR DAY AND DO ME NOT TO DEY DO NOT MAKE ME DIE
WITH THAT HIS COURSER TURNED HE ABOUT
WITH FACE PALE AND UNTO DIOMEDE
NO WORD HE SPAKE NOR NONE OF ALL HIS ROUT
OF WHICH THE SON OF TYDEUS 81 TOOKE HEED
AS HE THAT COUTHE MORE THAN THE CREED 82 KNEW
IN SUCH A CRAFT AND BY THE REIN HER HENT TOOK
AND TROILUS TO TROYE HOMEWARD WENT
THIS DIOMEDE THAT LED HER BY THE BRIDLE
WHEN THAT HE SAW THE FOLK OF TROY AWAY
THOUGHT ALL MY LABOUR SHALL NOT BE ON IDLE IN VAIN
IF THAT I MAY FOR SOMEWHAT SHALL I SAY
FOR AT THE WORST IT MAY YET SHORT OUR WAY
I HAVE HEARD SAY EKE TIMES TWICE TWELVE
HE IS A FOOL THAT WILL FORGET HIMSELVE
BUT NATHELESS THIS THOUGHT HE WELL ENOUGH
THAT CERTAINLY I AM ABOUTE NAUGHT
IF THAT I SPEAK OF LOVE OR MAKE IT TOUGH MAKE ANY VIOLENT
FOR DOUBTELESS IF SHE HAVE IN HER THOUGHT IMMEDIATE EFFORT
HIM THAT I GUESS HE MAY NOT BE Y BROUGHT
SO SOON AWAY BUT I SHALL FIND A MEAN
THAT SHE NOT WIT AS YET SHALL WHAT I MEAN SHALL NOT YET KNOW
SO HE BEGAN A GENERAL CONVERSATION ASSURED HER OF NOT LESS
FRIENDSHIP AND HONOUR AMONG THE GREEKS THAN SHE HAD ENJOYED
IN TROY AND REQUESTED OF HER EARNESTLY TO TREAT HIM AS A BROTHER
AND ACCEPT HIS SERVICE FOR AT LAST HE SAID I AM AND SHALL BE
AY WHILE THAT MY LIFE MAY DURE YOUR OWN ABOVEN EV'RY
CREATURE
THUS SAID I NEVER E'ER NOW TO WOMAN BORN
FOR GOD MINE HEART AS WISLY GLADDEN SO SURELY
I LOVED NEVER WOMAN HEREBEFORN
AS PARAMOURS NOR EVER SHALL NO MO'
AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD BE NOT MY FOE
ALL CAN I NOT TO YOU MY LADY DEAR ALTHOUGH
COMPLAIN ARIGHT FOR I AM YET TO LEAR TEACH
AND WONDER NOT MINE OWEN LADY BRIGHT
THOUGH THAT I SPEAK OF LOVE TO YOU THUS BLIVE SOON
FOR I HAVE HEARD ERE THIS OF MANY A WIGHT
THAT LOVED THING HE NE'ER SAW IN HIS LIVE
EKE I AM NOT OF POWER FOR TO STRIVE
AGAINST THE GOD OF LOVE BUT HIM OBEY
I WILL ALWAY AND MERCY I YOU PRAY
CRESSIDA ANSWERED HIS DISCOURSES AS THOUGH SHE SCARCELY HEARD
THEM YET SHE THANKED HIM FOR HIS TROUBLE AND COURTESY AND
ACCEPTED HIS OFFERED FRIENDSHIP PROMISING TO TRUST HIM AS WELL
SHE MIGHT
THEN SHE ALIGHTED FROM HER STEED AND WITH HER HEART
NIGH BREAKING WAS WELCOMED TO THE EMBRACE OF HER FATHER
MEANWHILE TROILUS BACK IN TROY WAS LAMENTING WITH TEARS THE
LOSS OF HIS LOVE DESPAIRING OF HIS OR HER ABILITY TO SURVIVE THE TEN
DAYS AND SPENDING THE NIGHT IN WAILING SLEEPLESS TOSSING AND
TROUBLOUS DREAMS
IN THE MORNING HE WAS VISITED BY PANDARUS
TO WHOM HE GAVE DIRECTIONS FOR HIS FUNERAL DESIRING THAT THE
POWDER INTO WHICH HIS HEART WAS BURNED SHOULD BE KEPT IN A
GOLDEN URN AND GIVEN TO CRESSIDA
PANDARUS RENEWED HIS OLD
COUNSELS AND CONSOLATIONS REMINDED HIS FRIEND THAT TEN DAYS
WERE A SHORT TIME TO WAIT ARGUED AGAINST HIS FAITH IN EVIL
DREAMS AND URGED HIM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TRUCE AND
BEGUILE THE TIME BY A VISIT TO KING SARPEDON A LYCIAN PRINCE
WHO HAD COME TO AID THE TROJANS
SARPEDON ENTERTAINED THEM
SPLENDIDLY BUT NO FEASTING NO POMP NO MUSIC OF INSTRUMENTS
NO SINGING OF FAIR LADIES COULD MAKE UP FOR THE ABSENCE OF
CRESSIDA TO THE DESOLATE TROILUS WHO WAS FOR EVER PORING UPON
HER OLD LETTERS AND RECALLING HER LOVED FORM
THUS HE DROVE TO
AN END THE FOURTH DAY AND WOULD HAVE THEN RETURNED TO TROY
BUT FOR THE REMONSTRANCES OF PANDARUS WHO ASKED IF THEY HAD
VISITED SARPEDON ONLY TO FETCH FIRE AT LAST AT THE END OF A
WEEK THEY RETURNED TO TROY TROILUS HOPING TO FIND CRESSIDA
AGAIN IN THE CITY PANDARUS ENTERTAINING A SCEPTICISM WHICH HE
CONCEALED FROM HIS FRIEND
THE MORNING AFTER THEIR RETURN
TROILUS WAS IMPATIENT TILL HE HAD GONE TO THE PALACE OF CRESSIDA
BUT WHEN HE FOUND HER DOORS ALL CLOSED WELL NIGH FOR SORROW
ADOWN HE GAN TO FALL
THEREWITH WHEN HE WAS WARE AND GAN BEHOLD
HOW SHUT WAS EV'RY WINDOW OF THE PLACE
AS FROST HIM THOUGHT HIS HEARTE GAN TO COLD BEGAN TO GROW COLD
FOR WHICH WITH CHANGED DEADLY PALE FACE
WITHOUTE WORD HE FORTH BEGAN TO PACE
AND AS GOD WOULD HE GAN SO FASTE RIDE
THAT NO WIGHT OF HIS COUNTENANCE ESPIED
THEN SAID HE THUS O PALACE DESOLATE
O HOUSE OF HOUSES WHILOM BESTE HIGHT FORMERLY CALLED BEST
O PALACE EMPTY AND DISCONSOLATE
O THOU LANTERN OF WHICH QUENCH'D IS THE LIGHT
O PALACE WHILOM DAY THAT NOW ART NIGHT
WELL OUGHTEST THOU TO FALL AND I TO DIE
SINCE SHE IS GONE THAT WONT WAS US TO GUY GUIDE RULE
O PALACE WHILOM CROWN OF HOUSES ALL
ILLUMINED WITH SUN OF ALLE BLISS
O RING FROM WHICH THE RUBY IS OUT FALL
O CAUSE OF WOE THAT CAUSE HAST BEEN OF BLISS
YET SINCE I MAY NO BET FAIN WOULD I KISS
THY COLDE DOORES DURST I FOR THIS ROUT
AND FAREWELL SHRINE OF WHICH THE SAINT IS OUT
FROM THENCE FORTH HE RIDETH UP AND DOWN
AND EV'RY THING CAME HIM TO REMEMBRANCE
AS HE RODE BY THE PLACES OF THE TOWN
IN WHICH HE WHILOM HAD ALL HIS PLEASANCE
LO YONDER SAW I MINE OWN LADY DANCE
AND IN THAT TEMPLE WITH HER EYEN CLEAR
ME CAUGHTE FIRST MY RIGHTE LADY DEAR
AND YONDER HAVE I HEARD FULL LUSTILY
MY DEARE HEARTE LAUGH AND YONDER PLAY
SAW I HER ONES EKE FULL BLISSFULLY
AND YONDER ONES TO ME GAN SHE SAY
'NOW GOODE SWEETE LOVE ME WELL I PRAY
AND YOND SO GLADLY GAN SHE ME BEHOLD
THAT TO THE DEATH MY HEART IS TO HER HOLD HOLDEN BOUND
AND AT THAT CORNER IN THE YONDER HOUSE
HEARD I MINE ALLERLEVEST LADY DEAR DEAREST OF ALL
SO WOMANLY WITH VOICE MELODIOUS
SINGE SO WELL SO GOODLY AND SO CLEAR
THAT IN MY SOULE YET ME THINKS I HEAR
THE BLISSFUL SOUND AND IN THAT YONDER PLACE
MY LADY FIRST ME TOOK UNTO HER GRACE
THEN HE WENT TO THE GATES AND GAZED ALONG THE WAY BY WHICH
HE HAD ATTENDED CRESSIDA AT HER DEPARTURE THEN HE FANCIED THAT
ALL THE PASSERS BY PITIED HIM AND THUS HE DROVE FORTH A DAY OR
TWO MORE SINGING A SONG OF FEW WORDS WHICH HE HAD MADE TO
LIGHTEN HIS HEART
O STAR OF WHICH I LOST HAVE ALL THE LIGHT
WITH HEARTE SORE WELL OUGHT I TO BEWAIL
THAT EVER DARK IN TORMENT NIGHT BY NIGHT
TOWARD MY DEATH WITH WIND I STEER AND SAIL
FOR WHICH THE TENTHE NIGHT IF THAT I FAIL MISS BE LEFT WITHOUT
THE GUIDING OF THY BEAMES BRIGHT AN HOUR
MY SHIP AND ME CHARYBDIS WILL DEVOUR
BY NIGHT HE PRAYED THE MOON TO RUN FAST ABOUT HER SPHERE BY
DAY HE REPROACHED THE TARDY SUN DREADING THAT PHAETHON HAD
COME TO LIFE AGAIN AND WAS DRIVING THE CHARIOT OF APOLLO OUT OF
ITS STRAIGHT COURSE
MEANWHILE CRESSIDA AMONG THE GREEKS WAS
BEWAILING THE REFUSAL OF HER FATHER TO LET HER RETURN THE CERTAINTY
THAT HER LOVER WOULD THINK HER FALSE AND THE HOPELESSNESS OF ANY
ATTEMPT TO STEAL AWAY BY NIGHT
HER BRIGHT FACE WAXED PALE HER
LIMBS LEAN AS SHE STOOD ALL DAY LOOKING TOWARD TROY THINKING
ON HER LOVE AND ALL HER PAST DELIGHTS REGRETTING THAT SHE HAD NOT
FOLLOWED THE COUNSEL OF TROILUS TO STEAL AWAY WITH HIM AND
FINALLY VOWING THAT SHE WOULD AT ALL HAZARDS RETURN TO THE CITY
BUT SHE WAS FATED ERE TWO MONTHS TO BE FULL FAR FROM ANY SUCH
INTENTION FOR DIOMEDE NOW BROUGHT ALL HIS SKILL INTO PLAY TO
ENTICE CRESSIDA INTO HIS NET
ON THE TENTH DAY DIOMEDE AS
FRESH AS BRANCH IN MAY CAME TO THE TENT OF CRESSIDA FEIGNING
BUSINESS WITH CALCHAS
CRESSIDE AT SHORTE WORDES FOR TO TELL
WELCOMED HIM AND DOWN BY HER HIM SET
AND HE WAS EATH ENOUGH TO MAKE DWELL EASILY PERSUADED TO STAY
AND AFTER THIS WITHOUTE LONGE LET DELAY
THE SPICES AND THE WINE MEN FORTH HIM FET FETCHED
AND FORTH THEY SPEAK OF THIS AND THAT Y FERE TOGETHER
AS FRIENDES DO OF WHICH SOME SHALL YE HEAR
HE GAN FIRST FALLEN OF THE WAR IN SPEECH
BETWEEN THEM AND THE FOLK OF TROYE TOWN
AND OF THE SIEGE HE GAN EKE HER BESEECH
TO TELL HIM WHAT WAS HER OPINIOUN
FROM THAT DEMAND HE SO DESCENDED DOWN
TO ASKE HER IF THAT HER STRANGE THOUGHT
THE GREEKES' GUISE AND WORKES THAT THEY WROUGHT

AND WHY HER FATHER TARRIED SO LONG DELAYED
TO WEDDE HER UNTO SOME WORTHY WIGHT
CRESSIDA THAT WAS IN HER PAINES STRONG
FOR LOVE OF TROILUS HER OWEN KNIGHT
SO FARFORTH AS SHE CUNNING HAD OR MIGHT ABILITY
ANSWER'D HIM THEN BUT AS FOR HIS INTENT PURPOSE

PART OF
AND AFTER THIS THE STORY TELLETH US
THAT SHE HIM GAVE THE FAIRE BAYE STEED
THE WHICH SHE ONES WON OF TROILUS
AND EKE A BROOCH AND THAT WAS LITTLE NEED
THAT TROILUS' WAS SHE GAVE THIS DIOMEDE
AND EKE THE BET FROM SORROW HIM TO RELIEVE
SHE MADE HIM WEAR A PENSEL OF HER SLEEVE
PENDANT 86
I FIND EKE IN THE STORY ELLESWHERE
WHEN THROUGH THE BODY HURT WAS DIOMEDE
BY TROILUS SHE WEPT MANY A TEAR
WHEN THAT SHE SAW HIS WIDE WOUNDES BLEED
AND THAT SHE TOOK TO KEEPE HIM GOOD HEED TEND CARE FOR
AND FOR TO HEAL HIM OF HIS SORROW'S SMART
MEN SAY I N'OT THAT SHE GAVE HIM HER HEART
KNOW NOT
AND YET WHEN PITY HAD THUS COMPLETED THE TRIUMPH OF
INCONSTANCY SHE MADE BITTER MOAN OVER HER FALSENESS TO ONE OF
THE NOBLEST AND WORTHIEST MEN THAT EVER WAS BUT IT WAS NOW TOO
LATE TO REPENT AND AT ALL EVENTS SHE RESOLVED THAT SHE WOULD BE
TRUE TO DIOMEDE ALL THE WHILE WEEPING FOR PITY OF THE ABSENT
TROILUS TO WHOM SHE WISHED EVERY HAPPINESS
THE TENTH DAY
MEANTIME HAD BARELY DAWNED WHEN TROILUS ACCOMPANIED BY
PANDARUS TOOK HIS STAND ON THE WALLS TO WATCH FOR THE RETURN OF
CRESSIDA
TILL NOON THEY STOOD THINKING THAT EVERY CORNER FROM
AFAR WAS SHE THEN TROILUS SAID THAT DOUBTLESS HER OLD FATHER BORE
THE PARTING ILL AND HAD DETAINED HER TILL AFTER DINNER SO THEY
WENT TO DINE AND RETURNED TO THEIR VAIN OBSERVATION ON THE
WALLS
TROILUS INVENTED ALL KINDS OF EXPLANATIONS FOR HIS
MISTRESS'S DELAY NOW HER FATHER WOULD NOT LET HER GO TILL EVE
NOW SHE WOULD RIDE QUIETLY INTO THE TOWN AFTER NIGHTFALL NOT TO
BE OBSERVED NOW HE MUST HAVE MISTAKEN THE DAY
FOR FIVE OR
SIX DAYS HE WATCHED STILL IN VAIN AND WITH DECREASING HOPE
GRADUALLY HIS STRENGTH DECAYED UNTIL HE COULD WALK ONLY WITH A
STAFF ANSWERING THE WONDERING INQUIRIES OF HIS FRIENDS BY SAYING
THAT HE HAD A GRIEVOUS MALADY ABOUT HIS HEART
ONE DAY HE
DREAMED THAT IN A FOREST HE SAW CRESSIDA IN THE EMBRACE OF A
BOAR AND HE HAD NO LONGER DOUBT OF HER FALSEHOOD
PANDARUS
HOWEVER EXPLAINED AWAY THE DREAM TO MEAN MERELY THAT
CRESSIDA WAS DETAINED BY HER FATHER WHO MIGHT BE AT THE POINT
OF DEATH AND HE COUNSELLED THE DISCONSOLATE LOVER TO WRITE A
LETTER BY WHICH HE MIGHT PERHAPS GET AT THE TRUTH
TROILUS
COMPLIED ENTREATING FROM HIS MISTRESS AT THE LEAST A LETTER OF
HOPE AND THE LADY ANSWERED THAT SHE COULD NOT COME NOW BUT
WOULD SO SOON AS SHE MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME MAKING HIM GREAT
FEAST AND SWEARING THAT SHE LOVED HIM BEST OF WHICH HE
FOUND BUT BOTTOMLESS BEHEST WHICH HE FOUND BUT GROUNDLESS
PROMISES DAY BY DAY INCREASED THE WOE OF TROILUS HE LAID
HIMSELF IN BED NEITHER EATING NOR DRINKING NOR SLEEPING NOR
SPEAKING ALMOST DISTRACTED BY THE THOUGHT OF CRESSIDA'S
UNKINDNESS
HE RELATED HIS DREAM TO HIS SISTER CASSANDRA WHO
TOLD HIM THAT THE BOAR BETOKENED DIOMEDE AND THAT
WHERESOEVER HIS LADY WAS DIORNEDE CERTAINLY HAD HER HEART AND
SHE WAS HIS WEEP IF THOU WILT OR LEAVE FOR OUT OF DOUBT THIS
DIOMEDE IS IN AND THOU ART OUT TROILUS ENRAGED REFUSED TO
BELIEVE CASSANDRA'S INTERPRETATION AS WELL HE CRIED MIGHT SUCH
A STORY BE CREDITED OF ALCESTIS WHO DEVOTED HER LIFE FOR HER
HUSBAND AND IN HIS WRATH HE STARTED FROM BED AS THOUGH ALL
WHOLE HAD HIM Y MADE A LEACH PHYSICIAN RESOLVING TO FIND
OUT THE TRUTH AT ALL HAZARDS
THE DEATH OF HECTOR MEANWHILE
ENHANCED THE SORROW WHICH HE ENDURED BUT HE FOUND TIME TO
WRITE OFTEN TO CRESSIDA BESEECHING HER TO COME AGAIN AND HOLD
HER TRUTH TILL ONE DAY HIS FALSE MISTRESS OUT OF PITY WROTE HIM
AGAIN IN THESE TERMS

HOW YE NE DO BUT HOLDE ME ON HAND 87
BUT NOW NO FORCE I CANNOT IN YOU GUESS NO MATTER
BUT ALLE TRUTH AND ALLE GENTLENESS
COMEN I WILL BUT YET IN SUCH DISJOINT JEOPARDY CRITICAL
I STANDE NOW THAT WHAT YEAR OR WHAT DAY POSITION
THAT THIS SHALL BE THAT CAN I NOT APPOINT
BUT IN EFFECT I PRAY YOU AS I MAY
FOR YOUR GOOD WORD AND FOR YOUR FRIENDSHIP AY
FOR TRUELY WHILE THAT MY LIFE MAY DURE
AS FOR A FRIEND YE MAY IN ME ASSURE DEPEND ON ME
YET PRAY I YOU ON EVIL YE NOT TAKE DO NOT TAKE IT ILL
THAT IT IS SHORT WHICH THAT I TO YOU WRITE
I DARE NOT WHERE I AM WELL LETTERS MAKE
NOR NEVER YET NE COULD I WELL ENDITE
EKE GREAT EFFECT MEN WRITE IN PLACE LITE MEN WRITE GREAT MATTER
TH' INTENT IS ALL AND NOT THE LETTER'S SPACE IN LITTLE SPACE
AND FARE NOW WELL GOD HAVE YOU IN HIS GRACE
LA VOSTRE C
THOUGH HE FOUND THIS LETTER ALL STRANGE AND THOUGHT IT LIKE A
KALENDES OF CHANGE 88 TROILUS COULD NOT BELIEVE HIS LADY SO
CRUEL AS TO FORSAKE HIM BUT HE WAS PUT OUT OF ALL DOUBT ONE DAY
THAT AS HE STOOD IN SUSPICION AND MELANCHOLY HE SAW A COAT
ARMOUR BORNE ALONG THE STREET IN TOKEN OF VICTORY BEFORE
DEIPHOBUS HIS BROTHER
DEIPHOBUS HAD WON IT FROM DIOMEDE IN
BATTLE THAT DAY AND TROILUS EXAMINING IT OUT OF CURIOSITY FOUND
WITHIN THE COLLAR A BROOCH WHICH HE HAD GIVEN TO CRESSIDA ON THE
MORNING SHE LEFT TROY AND WHICH SHE HAD PLEDGED HER FAITH TO
KEEP FOR EVER IN REMEMBRANCE OF HIS SORROW AND OF HIM
AT THIS
FATAL DISCOVERY OF HIS LADY'S UNTRUTH
GREAT WAS THE SORROW AND PLAINT OF TROILUS
BUT FORTH HER COURSE FORTUNE AY GAN TO HOLD
CRESSIDA LOV'D THE SON OF TYDEUS
AND TROILUS MUST WEEP IN CARES COLD
SUCH IS THE WORLD WHOSO IT CAN BEHOLD
IN EACH ESTATE IS LITTLE HEARTE'S REST
GOD LEND US EACH TO TAKE IT FOR THE BEST GRANT
IN MANY A CRUEL BATTLE TROILUS WROUGHT HAVOC AMONG THE
GREEKS AND OFTEN HE EXCHANGED BLOWS AND BITTER WORDS WITH
DIOMEDE WHOM HE ALWAYS SPECIALLY SOUGHT BUT IT WAS NOT THEIR
LOT THAT EITHER SHOULD FALL BY THE OTHER'S HAND
THE POET'S
PURPOSE HOWEVER HE TELLS US IS TO RELATE NOT THE WARLIKE DEEDS
OF TROILUS WHICH DARES HAS FULLY TOLD BUT HIS LOVE FORTUNES
BESEECHING EV'RY LADY BRIGHT OF HUE
AND EV'RY GENTLE WOMAN WHAT SHE BE WHATSOEVER SHE BE
ALBEIT THAT CRESSIDA WAS UNTRUE
THAT FOR THAT GUILT YE BE NOT WROTH WITH ME
YE MAY HER GUILT IN OTHER BOOKES SEE
AND GLADDER I WOULD WRITEN IF YOU LEST
OF PENELOPE'S TRUTH AND GOOD ALCESTE
NOR SAY I NOT THIS ONLY ALL FOR MEN
BUT MOST FOR WOMEN THAT BETRAYED BE
THROUGH FALSE FOLK GOD GIVE THEM SORROW AMEN
THAT WITH THEIR GREATE WIT AND SUBTILTY
BETRAYE YOU AND THIS COMMOVETH ME
TO SPEAK AND IN EFFECT YOU ALL I PRAY
BEWARE OF MEN AND HEARKEN WHAT I SAY
GO LITTLE BOOK GO LITTLE TRAGEDY
THERE GOD MY MAKER YET ERE THAT I DIE
SO SEND ME MIGHT TO MAKE SOME COMEDY
BUT LITTLE BOOK NO MAKING THOU ENVY BE ENVIOUS OF NO POETRY 89
BUT SUBJECT BE UNTO ALL POESY
AND KISS THE STEPS WHERE AS THOU SEEST SPACE
OF VIRGIL OVID HOMER LUCAN STACE
AND FOR THERE IS SO GREAT DIVERSITY

SO PRAY I GOD THAT NONE MISWRITE THEE
NOR THEE MISMETRE FOR DEFAULT OF TONGUE
AND READ WHERESO THOU BE OR ELLES SUNG
THAT THOU BE UNDERSTANDEN GOD I 'SEECH BESEECH
BUT YET TO PURPOSE OF MY RATHER SPEECH EARLIER SUBJECT 90

AND WHEN THAT HE WAS SLAIN IN THIS MANNERE

IN CONVERSE LEAVING EV'RY ELEMENT

FROM HIM AND HAD PROVED UNFAITHFUL

TISIPHONE ONE OF THE EUMENIDES OR FURIES WHO AVENGED ON
MEN IN THE NEXT WORLD THE CRIMES COMMITTED ON EARTH

OF PARIS IN CARRYING OFF HELEN THE WIFE OF HIS HOST MENELAUS
AND THUS IMPIOUSLY SINNING AGAINST THE LAWS OF HOSPITALITY

TROY WHERE ILUS WAS JUST BEGINNING TO FOUND THE CITY AND ILUS
ERECTED A SANCTUARY IN WHICH IT WAS PRESERVED WITH GREAT
HONOUR AND CARE SINCE ON ITS SAFETY WAS SUPPOSED TO DEPEND THE
SAFETY OF THE CITY

THE THIRD OF MAY SEEMS EITHER TO HAVE POSSESSED PECULIAR
FAVOUR OR SIGNIFICANCE WITH CHAUCER PERSONALLY OR TO HAVE HAD A
SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH THOSE MAY OBSERVANCES

IN THE COURT OF LOVE THE POET SAYS OF AVAUNTER THAT

TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
CHAUCER'S DREAM
THIS PRETTY ALLEGORY OR RATHER CONCEIT CONTAINING ONE OR TWO
PASSAGES THAT FOR VIVIDNESS AND FOR DELICACY YIELD TO NOTHING IN
THE WHOLE RANGE OF CHAUCER'S POETRY HAD NEVER BEEN PRINTED
BEFORE THE YEAR 1597 WHEN IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE EDITION OF
SPEGHT
BEFORE THAT DATE INDEED A DREAM OF CHAUCER HAD BEEN
PRINTED BUT THE POEM SO DESCRIBED WAS IN REALITY THE BOOK OF
THE DUCHESS OR THE DEATH OF BLANCHE DUCHESS OF LANCASTER
WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT EDITION
SPEGHT SAYS THAT
THIS DREAM DEVISED BY CHAUCER SEEMETH TO BE A COVERT REPORT
OF THE MARRIAGE OF JOHN OF GAUNT THE KING'S SON WITH BLANCHE
THE DAUGHTER OF HENRY DUKE OF LANCASTER WHO AFTER LONG LOVE
DURING THE TIME WHEREOF THE POET FEIGNETH THEM TO BE DEAD
WERE IN THE END BY CONSENT OF FRIENDS HAPPILY MARRIED FIGURED
BY A BIRD BRINGING IN HIS BILL AN HERB WHICH RESTORED THEM TO LIFE
AGAIN
HERE ALSO IS SHOWED CHAUCER'S MATCH WITH A CERTAIN
GENTLEWOMAN WHO ALTHOUGH SHE WAS A STRANGER WAS
NOTWITHSTANDING SO WELL LIKED AND LOVED OF THE LADY BLANCHE
AND HER LORD AS CHAUCER HIMSELF ALSO WAS THAT GLADLY THEY
CONCLUDED A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THEM JOHN OF GAUNT AT THE AGE
OF NINETEEN AND WHILE YET EARL OF RICHMOND WAS MARRIED TO THE
LADY BLANCHE AT READING IN MAY 1359 CHAUCER THEN A PRISONER
IN FRANCE PROBABLY DID NOT RETURN TO ENGLAND TILL PEACE WAS
CONCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO THAT HIS MARRIAGE TO PHILIPPA
ROET THE SISTER OF THE DUCHESS BLANCHE'S FAVOURITE ATTENDANT
KATHARINE ROET COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE TILL SOME TIME AFTER
THAT OF THE DUKE
IN THE POEM IT IS REPRESENTED TO HAVE
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BUT NO CONSEQUENCE NEED BE ATTACHED TO
THAT STATEMENT
ENOUGH THAT IT FOLLOWED AT NO GREAT INTERVAL OF
TIME AND THAT THE INTIMATE RELATIONS WHICH CHAUCER HAD ALREADY
BEGUN TO FORM WITH JOHN OF GAUNT MIGHT WELL WARRANT HIM IN
WRITING THIS POEM ON THE OCCASION OF THE DUKE'S MARRIAGE AND
IN WEAVING HIS OWN LOVE FORTUNES WITH THOSE OF THE PRINCIPAL
FIGURES
IN THE NECESSARY ABRIDGEMENT OF THE POEM FOR THE
PRESENT EDITION THE SUBSIDIARY BRANCH OF THE ALLEGORY RELATING TO
THE POET'S OWN LOVE AFFAIR HAS BEEN SO FAR AS POSSIBLE SEPARATED
FROM THE MAIN BRANCH WHICH SHADOWS FORTH THE FORTUNES OF JOHN
AND BLANCHE
THE POEM IN FULL CONTAINS WITH AN ENVOY
ARBITRARILY APPENDED 2233 LINES OF WHICH 510 ARE GIVEN HERE
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE MODERN SCHOLARS BELIEVE THAT CHAUCER WAS
NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS POEM
WHEN FLORA THE QUEEN OF PLEASANCE
HAD WHOLLY ACHIEV'D THE OBEISANCE WON THE OBEDIENCE
OF THE FRESH AND THE NEW SEASON
THOROUGH EV'RY REGION
AND WITH HER MANTLE WHOLE COVERT WHOLLY COVERED
WHAT WINTER HAD MADE DISCOVERT STRIPPED
ON A MAY NIGHT THE POET LAY ALONE THINKING OF HIS LADY AND ALL
HER BEAUTY AND FALLING ASLEEP HE DREAMED THAT HE WAS IN AN
ISLAND
WHERE WALL AND GATE WAS ALL OF GLASS
AND SO WAS CLOSED ROUND ABOUT
THAT LEAVELESS NONE CAME IN NOR OUT WITHOUT PERMISSION
UNCOUTH AND STRANGE TO BEHOLD
FOR EV'RY GATE OF FINE GOLD
A THOUSAND FANES AY TURNING VANES WEATHERCOCKS
ENTUNED HAD AND BIRDS SINGING CONTRIVED SO AS TO EMIT
DIVERSELY ON EACH FANE A PAIR A MUSICAL SOUND
WITH OPEN MOUTH AGAINST THE AIR 1
AND OF A SUIT WERE ALL THE TOW'RS OF THE SAME PLAN
SUBTILLY CARVEN AFT FLOW'RS CARVED TO REPRESENT
OF UNCOUTH COLOURS DURING AY LASTING FOREVER
THAT NEVER BE NONE SEEN IN MAY
WITH MANY A SMALL TURRET HIGH
BUT MAN ALIVE I COULD NOT SIGH SEE
NOR CREATURES SAVE LADIES PLAY DISPORTING THEMSELVES
WHICH WERE SUCH OF THEIR ARRAY
THAT AS ME THOUGHT OF GOODLIHEAD FOR COMELINESS
THEY PASSED ALL AND WOMANHEAD
FOR TO BEHOLD THEM DANCE AND SING
IT SEEMED LIKE NONE EARTHLY THING
AND ALL WERE OF THE SAME AGE SAVE ONE WHO WAS ADVANCED IN
YEARS THOUGH NO LESS GAY IN DEMEANOUR THAN THE REST
WHILE HE
STOOD ADMIRING THE RICHNESS AND BEAUTY OF THE PLACE AND THE
FAIRNESS OF THE LADIES WHICH HAD THE NOTABLE GIFT OF ENDURING
UNIMPAIRED TILL DEATH THE POET WAS ACCOSTED BY THE OLD LADY TO
WHOM HE HAD TO YIELD HIMSELF PRISONER BECAUSE THE ORDINANCE OF
THE ISLE WAS THAT NO MAN SHOULD DWELL THERE AND THE LADIES' FEAR
OF BREAKING THE LAW WAS ENHANCED BY THE TEMPORARY ABSENCE OF
THEIR QUEEN FROM THE REALM
JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE CRY WAS
RAISED THAT THE QUEEN CAME ALL THE LADIES HASTENED TO MEET HER
AND SOON THE POET SAW HER APPROACH BUT IN HER COMPANY HIS
MISTRESS WEARING THE SAME GARB AND A SEEMLY KNIGHT
ALL THE
LADIES WONDERED GREATLY AT THIS AND THE QUEEN EXPLAINED
MY SISTERS HOW IT HATH BEFALL BEFALLEN
I TROW YE KNOW IT ONE AND ALL
THAT OF LONG TIME HERE HAVE I BEEN
WITHIN THIS ISLE BIDING AS QUEEN
LIVING AT EASE THAT NEVER WIGHT
MORE PERFECT JOYE HAVE NOT MIGHT
AND TO YOU BEEN OF GOVERNANCE
SUCH AS YOU FOUND IN WHOLE PLEASANCE 2
IN EVERY THING AS YE KNOW
AFTER OUR CUSTOM AND OUR LAW
WHICH HOW THEY FIRSTE FOUNDED WERE
I TROW YE WOT ALL THE MANNERE
AND WHO THE QUEEN IS OF THIS ISLE
AS I HAVE BEEN THIS LONGE WHILE
EACH SEVEN YEARS MUST OF USAGE
VISIT THE HEAV'NLY HERMITAGE
WHICH ON A ROCK SO HIGHE STANDS
IN A STRANGE SEA OUT FROM ALL LANDS
THAT FOR TO MAKE THE PILGRIMAGE
IS CALL'D A PERILOUS VOYAGE
FOR IF THE WIND BE NOT GOOD FRIEND

TO GATHER THESE SAID APPLES THREE
I HAVE NOT FAIL'D AGAINST THE DAY
THITHERWARD TO TAKE THE WAY
WEENING TO SPEED AS I HAD OFT
EXPECTING TO SUCCEED
BUT WHEN I CAME I FOUND ALOFT
MY SISTER WHICH THAT HERO STANDS
HAVING THOSE APPLES IN HER HANDS
ADVISING THEM AND NOTHING SAID REGARDING GAZING ON
BUT LOOK'D AS SHE WERE WELL APAID SATISFIED
AND AS I STOOD HER TO BEHOLD
THINKING HOW MY JOYS WERE COLD
SINCE I THESE APPLES HAVE NOT MIGHT MIGHT NOT HAVE
EVEN WITH THAT SO CAME THIS KNIGHT
AND IN HIS ARMS OF ME UNWARE
ME TOOK AND TO HIS SHIP ME BARE
AND SAID THOUGH HIM I NE'ER HAD SEEN
YET HAD I LONG HIS LADY BEEN
WHEREFORE I SHOULDE WITH HIM WEND
AND HE WOULD TO HIS LIFE'S END
MY SERVANT BE AND GAN TO SING
AS ONE THAT HAD WON A RICH THING
THEN WERE MY SPIRITS FROM ME GONE
SO SUDDENLY EVERY ONE
THAT IN ME APPEAR'D BUT DEATH
FOR I FELT NEITHER LIFE NOR BREATH
NOR GOOD NOR HARME NONE I KNEW
THE SUDDEN PAIN ME WAS SO NEW
THAT HAD NOT THE HASTY GRACE BE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE
OF THIS LADY THAT FROM THE TREE PROMPT KINDNESS
OF HER GENTLENESS SO BLED HASTENED
ME TO COMFORTEN I HAD DIED
AND OF HER THREE APPLES SHE ONE
INTO MINE HAND THERE PUT ANON
WHICH BROUGHT AGAIN MY MIND AND BREATH
AND ME RECOVER'D FROM THE DEATH
WHEREFORE TO HER SO AM I HOLD BEHOLDEN OBLIGED
THAT FOR HER ALL THINGS DO I WO'LD
FOR SHE WAS LEACH OF ALL MY SMART PHYSICIAN
AND FROM GREAT PAIN SO QUIT MY HEART

THAT OF MY WOE HE WAS ILL PAID DISTRESSED ILL PLEASED
AND CURS'D THE SHIP THAT HIM THERE BROUGHT
THE MAST THE MASTER THAT IT WROUGHT
AND AS EACH THING MUST HAVE AN END
MY SISTER HERE OUR BOTHER FRIEND 4
GAN WITH HER WORDS SO WOMANLY
THIS KNIGHT ENTREAT AND CUNNINGLY
FOR MINE HONOUR AND HERS ALSO
AND SAID THAT WITH HER WE SHOULD GO
BOTH IN HER SHIP WHERE SHE WAS BROUGHT
WHICH WAS SO WONDERFULLY WROUGHT
SO CLEAN SO RICH AND SO ARRAY'D
THAT WE WERE BOTH CONTENT AND PAID SATISFIED
AND ME TO COMFORT AND TO PLEASE
AND MY HEART FOR TO PUT AT EASE
SHE TOOK GREAT PAIN IN LITTLE WHILE
AND THUS HATH BROUGHT US TO THIS ISLE
AS YE MAY SEE WHEREFORE EACH ONE
I PRAY YOU THANK HER ONE AND ONE
AS HEARTILY AS YE CAN DEVISE
OR IMAGINE IN ANY WISE
AT ONCE THERE THEN MEN MIGHTE SEE'N
A WORLD OF LADIES FALL ON KNEEN
BEFORE MY LADY
THANKING HER AND PLACING THEMSELVES AT HER COMMANDMENT
THEN THE QUEEN SENT THE AGED LADY TO THE KNIGHT TO LEARN OF HIM
WHY HE HAD DONE HER ALL THIS WOE AND WHEN THE MESSENGER HAD
DISCHARGED HER MISSION TELLING THE KNIGHT THAT IN THE GENERAL
OPINION HE HAD DONE AMISS HE FELL DOWN SUDDENLY AS IF DEAD FOR
SORROW AND REPENTANCE
ONLY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY BY THE QUEEN
HERSELF WAS HE RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS AND COMFORT BUT
THOUGH SHE SPOKE KIND AND HOPE INSPIRING WORDS HER HEART WAS
NOT IN HER SPEECH
FOR HER INTENT WAS TO HIS BARGE
HIM FOR TO BRING AGAINST THE EVE
WITH CERTAIN LADIES AND TAKE LEAVE
AND PRAY HIM OF HIS GENTLENESS
TO SUFFER HER THENCEFORTH IN PEACE LET HER DWELL
AS OTHER PRINCES HAD BEFORE
AND FROM THENCEFORTH FOR EVERMORE
SHE WOULD HIM WORSHIP IN ALL WISE
THAT GENTLENESSE MIGHT DEVISE
AND PAIN HER WHOLLY TO FULFIL MAKE HER UTMOST EFFORTS
IN HONOUR HIS PLEASURE AND WILL
AND DURING THUS THIS KNIGHTE'S WOE
PRESENT THE QUEEN AND OTHER MO' THERE BEING PRESENT
MY LADY AND MANY ANOTHER WIGHT
TEN THOUSAND SHIPPES AT A SIGHT
I SAW COME O'ER THE WAVY FLOOD
WITH SAIL AND OAR THAT AS I STOOD
THEM TO BEHOLD I GAN MARVAIL
FROM WHOM MIGHT COME SO MANY A SAIL
FOR SINCE THE TIME THAT I WAS BORN
SUCH A NAVY THEREBEFORN
HAD I NOT SEEN NOR SO ARRAY'D
THAT FOR THE SIGHT MY HEARTE PLAY'D
AY TO AND FRO WITHIN MY BREAST
FOR JOY LONG WAS ERE IT WOULD REST
FOR THERE WERE SAILES FULL OF FLOW'RS EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS
AFTER CASTLES WITH HUGE TOW'RS 5
SEEMING FULL OF ARMES BRIGHT
THAT WOND'ROUS LUSTY WAS THE SIGHT PLEASANT
WITH LARGE TOPS AND MASTES LONG
RICHLY DEPAINT' AND REAR'D AMONG RAISED AMONG THEM
AT CERTAIN TIMES GAN REPAIR
SMALLE BIRDES DOWN FROM THE AIR
AND ON THE SHIPPES' BOUNDS ABOUT BULWARKS
SAT AND SANG WITH VOICE FULL OUT
BALLADS AND LAYS RIGHT JOYOUSLY
AS THEY COULD IN THEIR HARMONY
THE LADIES WERE ALARMED AND SORROW STRICKEN AT SIGHT OF THE
SHIPS THINKING THAT THE KNIGHT'S COMPANIONS WERE ON BOARD AND
THEY WENT TOWARDS THE WALLS OF THE ISLE TO SHUT THE GATES
BUT IT
WAS CUPID WHO CAME AND HE HAD ALREADY LANDED AND MARCHED
STRAIGHT TO THE PLACE WHERE THE KNIGHT LAY
THEN HE CHID THE
QUEEN FOR HER UNKINDNESS TO HIS SERVANT SHOT AN ARROW INTO HER
HEART AND PASSED THROUGH THE CROWD UNTIL HE FOUND THE POET'S
LADY WHOM HE SALUTED AND COMPLIMENTED URGING HER TO HAVE
PITY ON HIM THAT LOVED HER
WHILE THE POET STANDING APART WAS
REVOLVING ALL THIS IN HIS MIND AND RESOLVING TRULY TO SERVE HIS
LADY HE SAW THE QUEEN ADVANCE TO CUPID WITH A PETITION IN
WHICH SHE BESOUGHT FORGIVENESS OF PAST OFFENCES AND PROMISED
CONTINUAL AND ZEALOUS SERVICE TILL HER DEATH
CUPID SMILED AND
SAID THAT HE WOULD BE KING WITHIN THAT ISLAND HIS NEW CONQUEST
THEN AFTER LONG CONFERENCE WITH THE QUEEN HE CALLED A COUNCIL
FOR THE MORROW OF ALL WHO CHOSE TO WEAR HIS COLOURS
IN THE
MORNING SUCH WAS THE PRESS OF LADIES THAT SCARCELY COULD
STANDING ROOM BE FOUND IN ALL THE PLAIN
CUPID PRESIDED AND ONE
OF HIS COUNSELLORS ADDRESSED THE MIGHTY CROWD PROMISING THAT
ERE HIS DEPARTURE HIS LORD SHOULD BRING TO AN AGREEMENT ALL THE
PARTIES THERE PRESENT
THEN CUPID GAVE TO THE KNIGHT AND THE
DREAMER EACH HIS LADY PROMISED HIS FAVOUR TO ALL THE OTHERS IN
THAT PLACE WHO WOULD TRULY AND BUSILY SERVE IN LOVE AND AT
EVENING TOOK HIS DEPARTURE
NEXT MORNING HAVING DECLINED THE
PROFFERED SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ISLAND THE POET'S MISTRESS ALSO
EMBARKED LEAVING HIM BEHIND BUT HE DASHED THROUGH THE
WAVES WAS DRAWN ON BOARD HER SHIP FROM PERIL OF DEATH AND
GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED INTO HIS LADY'S LASTING FAVOUR
HERE THE POET
AWAKES FINDING HIS CHEEKS AND BODY ALL WET WITH TEARS AND
REMOVING INTO ANOTHER CHAMBER TO REST MORE IN PEACE HE FALLS
ASLEEP ANEW AND CONTINUES THE DREAM
AGAIN HE IS WITHIN THE
ISLAND WHERE THE KNIGHT AND ALL THE LADIES ARE ASSEMBLED ON A
GREEN AND IT IS RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY NOT ONLY THAT THE
KNIGHT SHALL BE THEIR KING BUT THAT EVERY LADY THERE SHALL BE
WEDDED ALSO
IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE KNIGHT SHALL DEPART THAT
VERY DAY AND RETURN WITHIN TEN DAYS WITH SUCH A HOST OF
BENEDICTS THAT NONE IN THE ISLE NEED LACK HUSBANDS
THE KNIGHT
ANON INTO A LITTLE BARGE
BROUGHT WAS LATE AGAINST AN EVE
WHERE OF ALL HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
WHICH BARGE WAS AS A MAN THOUGHT
AFT HIS PLEASURE TO HIM BROUGHT ACCORDING TO
THE QUEEN HERSELF ACCUSTOM'D AY
IN THE SAME BARGE TO PLAY TAKE HER SPORT
IT NEEDED NEITHER MAST NOR ROTHER RUDDER
I HAVE NOT HEARD OF SUCH ANOTHER
NOR MASTER FOR THE GOVERNANCE STEERING
IT SAILED BY THOUGHT AND PLEASANCE
WITHOUTE LABOUR EAST AND WEST
ALL WAS ONE CALM OR TEMPEST
6
AND I WENT WITH AT HIS REQUEST
AND WAS THE FIRST PRAY'D TO THE FEAST THE BRIDAL FEAST
WHEN HE CAME UNTO HIS COUNTRY
AND PASSED HAD THE WAVY SEA
IN A HAVEN DEEP AND LARGE
HE LEFT HIS RICH AND NOBLE BARGE
AND TO THE COURT SHORTLY TO TELL
HE WENT WHERE HE WAS WONT TO DWELL
AND WAS GLADLY RECEIVED AS KING BY THE ESTATES OF THE LAND FOR
DURING HIS ABSENCE HIS FATHER OLD AND WISE AND HOAR HAD
DIED COMMENDING TO THEIR FIDELITY HIS ABSENT SON
THE PRINCE
RELATED TO THE ESTATES HIS JOURNEY AND HIS SUCCESS IN FINDING THE
PRINCESS IN QUEST OF WHOM HE HAD GONE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE AND
SAID THAT HE MUST HAVE SIXTY THOUSAND GUESTS AT HIS MARRIAGE
FEAST
THE LORDS GLADLY GUARANTEED THE NUMBER WITHIN THE SET
TIME BUT AFTERWARDS THEY FOUND THAT FIFTEEN DAYS MUST BE SPENT
IN THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS
BETWEEN SHAME AND SORROW THE
PRINCE THUS COMPELLED TO BREAK HIS FAITH TOOK TO HIS BED AND
IN WAILING AND SELF REPROACH
ENDUR'D THE DAYS FIFTEEN
TILL THAT THE LORDS ON AN EVENE EVENING
HIM CAME AND TOLD THEY READY WERE
AND SHOWED IN FEW WORDES THERE
HOW AND WHAT WISE THEY HAD PURVEY'D PROVIDED SUITABLY
FOR HIS ESTATE AND TO HIM SAID TO HIS RANK
THAT TWENTY THOUSAND KNIGHTS OF NAME
AND FORTY THOUSAND WITHOUT BLAME
ALLE COME OF NOBLE LIGNE LINE LINEAGE
TOGETHER IN A COMPANY
WERE LODGED ON A RIVER'S SIDE
HIM AND HIS PLEASURE THERE T'ABIDE
THE PRINCE THEN FOR JOY UPROSE
AND WHERE THEY LODGED WERE HE GOES
WITHOUTE MORE THAT SAME NIGHT
AND THERE HIS SUPPER MADE TO DIGHT HAD PREPARED
AND WITH THEM BODE TILL IT WAS DAY
ABODE WAITED
AND FORTHWITH TO TAKE HIS JOURNEY
LEAVING THE STRAIT HOLDING THE LARGE
TILL HE CAME TO HIS NOBLE BARGE
AND WHEN THE PRINCE THIS LUSTY KNIGHT
WITH HIS PEOPLE IN ARMES BRIGHT
WAS COME WHERE HE THOUGHT TO PASS CROSS TO THE ISLE
AND KNEW WELL NONE ABIDING WAS
BEHIND BUT ALL WERE THERE PRESENT
FORTHWITH ANON ALL HIS INTENT
HE TOLD THEM THERE AND MADE HIS CRIES PROCLAMATION
THOROUGH HIS HOSTE THAT DAY TWICE
COMMANDING EV'RY LIVING WIGHT
THERE BEING PRESENT IN HIS SIGHT
TO BE THE MORROW ON THE RIVAGE SHORE
THERE HE BEGIN WOULD HIS VOYAGE
THE MORROW COME THE CRY WAS KEPT PROCLAMATION WAS OBEYED
BUT FEW WERE THERE THAT NIGHT THAT SLEPT
BUT TRUSS'D AND PURVEY'D FOR THE MORROW PACKED UP AND PROVIDED
FOR FAULT OF SHIPS WAS ALL THEIR SORROW LACK SHORTAGE
FOR SAVE THE BARGE AND OTHER TWO
OF SHIPPES THERE I SAW NO MO'
THUS IN THEIR DOUBTES AS THEY STOOD
WAXING THE SEA COMING THE FLOOD
WAS CRIED TO SHIP GO EV'RY WIGHT
THEN WAS BUT HIE THAT HIE HIM MIGHT WHOEVER COULD HASTEN DID

BUT WAS LODGED AND ROOM ENOUGH
AT WHICH SHIPPING ME THOUGHT I LOUGH LAUGHED

HOW EVER SUCH A SHIP WAS WROUGHT CONSTRUCTED
FOR WHAT PEOPLE THAT CAN INCREASE HOWEVER THE NUMBERS INCREASED
NOR NE'ER SO THICK MIGHT BE THE PREASE PRESS CROWD
BUT ALLE HADDE ROOM AT WILL
THERE WAS NOT ONE WAS LODGED ILL

FORTH WENT THE SHIP SAID WAS THE CREED 9
AND ON THEIR KNEES FOR THEIR GOOD SPEED TO PRAY FOR SUCCESS
DOWN KNEELED EV'RY WIGHT A WHILE
AND PRAYED FAST THAT TO THE ISLE
THEY MIGHTE COME IN SAFETY
THE PRINCE AND ALL THE COMPANY
WITH WORSHIP AND WITHOUTE BLAME
OR DISCLANDER OF HIS NAME REPROACH SLANDER
OF THE PROMISE HE SHOULD RETURN
WITHIN THE TIME HE DID SOJOURN
IN HIS LANDE BIDING HIS HOST WAITING FOR
THIS WAS THEIR PRAYER LEAST AND MOST
TO KEEP THE DAY IT MIGHT NOT BE'N
THAT HE APPOINTED WITH THE QUEEN
WHEREFORE THE PRINCE SLEPT NEITHER DAY NOR NIGHT TILL HE AND HIS
PEOPLE LANDED ON THE GLASS WALLED ISLE WEENING TO BE IN HEAV'N
THAT NIGHT BUT ERE THEY HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY THEY MET A LADY
ALL IN BLACK WITH PITEOUS COUNTENANCE WHO REPROACHED THE
PRINCE FOR HIS UNTRUTH AND INFORMED HIM THAT UNABLE TO BEAR THE
REPROACH TO THEIR NAME CAUSED BY THE LIGHTNESS OF THEIR TRUST IN
STRANGERS THE QUEEN AND ALL THE LADIES OF THE ISLE HAD VOWED
NEITHER TO EAT NOR DRINK NOR SLEEP NOR SPEAK NOR CEASE
WEEPING TILL ALL WERE DEAD
THE QUEEN HAD DIED THE FIRST AND HALF
OF THE OTHER LADIES HAD ALREADY UNDER THE EARTH TA'EN LODGING

SCARCELY HAS THE LADY CEASED TO SPEAK WHEN THE PRINCE PLUCKS

GAN REAR THOROUGH THE COMPANY THROUGHOUT
THAT TO THE HEAV'N HEARD WAS THE SOUN'
AND UNDER TH'EARTH AS FAR ADOWN
AND WILDE BEASTES FOR THE FEAR
SO SUDDENLY AFFRAYED WERE AFRAID
THAT FOR THE DOUBT WHILE THEY MIGHT DURE HAVE A CHANCE OF SAFETY
THEY RAN AS OF THEIR LIVES UNSURE
FROM THE WOODES INTO THE PLAIN
AND FROM VALLEYS THE HIGH MOUNTAIN
THEY SOUGHT AND RAN AS BEASTES BLIND
THAT CLEAN FORGOTTEN HAD THEIR KIND NATURE
THE LORDS OF THE LAGGARD HOST ASK THE WOEBEGONE LADY WHAT
SHOULD BE DONE SHE ANSWERS THAT NOTHING CAN NOW AVAIL BUT
THAT FOR REMEMBRANCE THEY SHOULD BUILD IN THEIR LAND OPEN TO
PUBLIC VIEW IN SOME NOTABLE OLD CITY A CHAPEL ENGRAVED WITH
SOME MEMORIAL OF THE QUEEN

ALL THE LADIES ONE AND ONE
BY COMPANIES WERE BROUGHT EACH ONE
AND PASS'D THE SEA AND TOOK THE LAND
AND IN NEW HEARSES ON A SAND
PUT AND BROUGHT WERE ALL ANON
UNTO A CITY CLOS'D WITH STONE
WHERE IT HAD BEEN USED AY
THE KINGES OF THE LAND TO LAY
AFTER THEY REIGNED IN HONOURS
AND WRIT WAS WHICH WERE CONQUEROURS
IN AN ABBEY OF NUNNES BLACK
WHICH ACCUSTOM'D WERE TO WAKE
AND OF USAGE RISE EACH A NIGHT
TO PRAY FOR EV'RY LIVING WIGHT
AND SO BEFELL AS IS THE GUISE
ORDAIN'D AND SAID WAS THE SERVICE
OF THE PRINCE AND EKE OF THE QUEEN
SO DEVOUTLY AS MIGHTE BE'N
AND AFTER THAT ABOUT THE HEARSES
MANY ORISONS AND VERSES
WITHOUTE NOTE 11 FULL SOFTELY MUSIC
SAID WERE AND THAT FULL HEARTILY
THAT ALL THE NIGHT TILL IT WAS DAY
THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH GAN PRAY
UNTO THE HOLY TRINITY

THE YOUNG MORROW WITH RAYES RED
WHICH FROM THE SUN ALL O'ER GAN SPREAD
ATTEMPER'D CLEARE WAS AND FAIR CLEMENT CALM
AND MADE A TIME OF WHOLESOME AIR
BEFELL A WONDROUS CASE AND STRANGE CHANCE EVENT
AMONG THE PEOPLE AND GAN CHANGE
SOON THE WORD AND EV'RY WOE
UNTO A JOY AND SOME TO TWO
A BIRD ALL FEATHER'D BLUE AND GREEN
WITH BRIGHTE RAYS LIKE GOLD BETWEEN

LIKE AS HE SET ALL THING AT NOUGHT
WITH VISAGE AND EYES ALL FORWEPT STEEPED IN TEARS
AND PALE AS A MAN LONG UNSLEPT
BY THE HEARSES AS HE STOOD
WITH HASTY HANDLING OF HIS HOOD
UNTO A PRINCE THAT BY HIM PAST
MADE THE BIRD SOMEWHAT AGHAST FRIGHTENED
WHEREFORE HE ROSE AND LEFT HIS SONG
AND DEPARTED FROM US AMONG
AND SPREAD HIS WINGES FOR TO PASS
BY THE PLACE WHERE HE ENTER'D WAS
AND IN HIS HASTE SHORTLY TO TELL
HIM HURT THAT BACKWARD DOWN HE FELL
FROM A WINDOW RICHLY PAINT

AS FOLK THAT WOULDEN IN NO WISE HAPPINESS
DESIRE MORE PERFECT PARADISE
ON THE MORROW A GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS CONVOKED AND IT WAS
RESOLVED THAT THE WEDDING FEAST SHOULD BE CELEBRATED WITHIN THE
ISLAND
MESSENGERS WERE SENT TO STRANGE REALMS TO INVITE KINGS

14
THE ABBESS MADE DILIGENCE I E
TO ADMINISTER THE GRAIN TO
THE DEAD LADIES
THE PROLOGUE TO THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN
SOME DIFFERENCE OF OPINION EXISTS AS TO THE DATE AT
WHICH CHAUCER WROTE THE LEGEND OF GOOD
WOMEN THOSE WHO WOULD FIX THAT DATE AT A
PERIOD NOT LONG BEFORE THE POET'S DEATH WHO
WOULD PLACE THE POEM INDEED AMONG HIS CLOSING
LABOURS SUPPORT THEIR OPINION BY THE FACT THAT THE
PROLOGUE RECITES MOST OF CHAUCER'S PRINCIPAL
WORKS AND GLANCES BESIDES AT A LONG ARRAY OF
OTHER PRODUCTIONS TOO MANY TO BE FULLY CATALOGUED
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS OBJECTED THAT THE
LEGEND MAKES NO MENTION OF THE CANTERBURY
TALES AS SUCH WHILE TWO OF THOSE TALES THE
KNIGHT'S AND THE SECOND NUN'S ARE ENUMERATED
BY THE TITLES WHICH THEY BORE AS SEPARATE
COMPOSITIONS BEFORE THEY WERE INCORPORATED IN THE
GREAT COLLECTION THE LOVE OF PALAMON AND
ARCITE AND THE LIFE OF SAINT CECILE SEE NOTE 1
TO THE SECOND NUN'S TALE
TYRWHITT SEEMS PERFECTLY
JUSTIFIED IN PLACING THE COMPOSITION OF THE POEM
IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THAT OF CHAUCER'S MAGNUM
OPUS AND AFTER THE MARRIAGE OF RICHARD II TO HIS
FIRST QUEEN ANNE OF BOHEMIA
THAT EVENT TOOK
PLACE IN 1382 AND SINCE IT IS TO ANNE THAT THE POET
REFERS WHEN HE MAKES ALCESTIS BID HIM GIVE HIS
POEM TO THE QUEEN AT ELTHAM OR AT SHEEN THE
LEGEND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN EARLIER
THE
OLD EDITIONS TELL US THAT SEVERAL LADIES IN THE COURT
TOOK OFFENCE AT CHAUCER'S LARGE SPEECHES AGAINST
THE UNTRUTH OF WOMEN THEREFORE THE QUEEN ENJOIN'D
HIM TO COMPILE THIS BOOK IN THE COMMENDATION OF
SUNDRY MAIDENS AND WIVES WHO SHOW'D THEMSELVES
FAITHFUL TO FAITHLESS MEN
THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
WRITTEN AFTER THE FLOWER AND THE LEAF EVIDENTLY IT
WAS FOR DISTINCT REFERENCES TO THAT POEM ARE TO BE
FOUND IN THE PROLOGUE BUT MORE INTERESTING IS THE
INDICATION WHICH IT FURNISHES THAT TROILUS AND
CRESSIDA WAS THE WORK NOT OF THE POET'S YOUTH
BUT OF HIS MATURER AGE
WE COULD HARDLY EXPECT THE
QUEEN WHETHER OF LOVE OR OF ENGLAND TO
DEMAND SERIOUSLY FROM CHAUCER A RETRACTATION OF
SENTIMENTS WHICH HE HAD EXPRESSED A FULL
GENERATION BEFORE AND FOR WHICH HE HAD MADE
ATONEMENT BY THE SPLENDID PRAISES OF TRUE LOVE SUNG
IN THE COURT OF LOVE THE CUCKOO AND THE
NIGHTINGALE AND OTHER POEMS OF YOUTH AND MIDDLE
LIFE
BUT TROILUS AND CRESSIDA IS COUPLED WITH
THE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE AS ONE OF THE POEMS
WHICH HAD GIVEN OFFENCE TO THE SERVANTS AND THE
GOD OF LOVE THEREFORE WE MAY SUPPOSE IT TO HAVE
MORE PROMINENTLY ENGAGED COURTLY NOTICE AT A LATER
PERIOD OF THE POET'S LIFE THAN EVEN ITS UNDOUBTED
POPULARITY COULD EXPLAIN
AT WHATEVER DATE OR IN
WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERTAKEN THE LEGEND
OF GOOD WOMEN IS A FRAGMENT
THERE ARE SEVERAL
SIGNS THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO CONTAIN THE STORIES OF
TWENTY FIVE LADIES ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE
GOOD WOMEN IS IN THE POEM ITSELF SET DOWN AT
NINETEEN BUT NINE LEGENDS ONLY WERE ACTUALLY
COMPOSED OR HAVE COME DOWN TO US
THEY ARE
THOSE OF CLEOPATRA QUEEN OF EGYPT 126 LINES
THISBE OF BABYLON 218 DIDO QUEEN OF CARTHAGE
442 HYPSIPYLE AND MEDEA 312 LUCRECE OF
ROME 206 ARIADNE OF ATHENS 340 PHIOMELA
167 PHYLLIS 168 AND HYPERMNESTRA 162
PREFIXED TO THESE STORIES WHICH ARE TRANSLATED OR
IMITATED FROM OVID IS A PROLOGUE CONTAINING 579
LINES THE ONLY PART OF THE LEGEND GIVEN IN THE
PRESENT EDITION
IT IS BY FAR THE MOST ORIGINAL THE
STRONGEST AND MOST PLEASING PART OF THE POEM THE
DESCRIPTION OF SPRING AND OF HIS ENJOYMENT OF THAT
SEASON ARE IN CHAUCER'S BEST MANNER AND THE
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY BY WHICH ALCESTIS MITIGATES THE
WRATH OF CUPID ADDS ANOTHER TO THE ABOUNDING
PROOFS THAT FOR HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
CHAUCER FAIRLY MERITS THE EPITHET OF MANY SIDED
WHICH SHAKESPEARE HAS WON BY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF
MAN
A THOUSAND TIMES I HAVE HEARDE TELL
THAT THERE IS JOY IN HEAV'N AND PAIN IN HELL
AND I ACCORD IT WELL THAT IT IS SO GRANT AGREE
BUT NATHELESS YET WOT I WELL ALSO KNOW
THAT THERE IS NONE DWELLING IN THIS COUNTRY
THAT EITHER HATH IN HEAV'N OR HELL Y BE BEEN
NOR MAY OF IT NO OTHER WAYES WITTEN KNOW
BUT AS HE HATH HEARD SAID OR FOUND IT WRITTEN
FOR BY ASSAY THERE MAY NO MAN IT PREVE PRACTICAL TRIAL
PROVE TEST
BUT GOD FORBID BUT THAT MEN SHOULD BELIEVE
WELL MORE THING THAN MEN HAVE SEEN WITH EYE
MEN SHALL NOT WEENEN EV'RY THING A LIE
BUT IF HIMSELF IT SEETH OR ELSE DO'TH UNLESS
FOR GOD WOT THING IS NEVER THE LESS SOOTH TRUE
THOUGH EV'RY WIGHTE MAY IT NOT Y SEE
BERNARD THE MONKE SAW NOT ALL PARDIE 1
THEN MUSTE WE TO BOOKES THAT WE FIND
THROUGH WHICH THAT OLDE THINGES BE IN MIND
AND TO THE DOCTRINE OF THESE OLDE WISE
GIVE CREDENCE IN EV'RY SKILFUL WISE REASONABLE
THAT TELLEN OF THESE OLD APPROVED STORIES
OF HOLINESS OF REGNES OF VICTORIES REIGNS KINGDOMS
OF LOVE OF HATE AND OTHER SUNDRY THINGS
OF WHICH I MAY NOT MAKE REHEARSINGS
AND IF THAT OLDE BOOKES WERE AWAY
Y LORN WERE OF ALL REMEMBRANCE THE KEY
WELL OUGHT WE THEN TO HONOUR AND BELIEVE
THESE BOOKES WHERE WE HAVE NONE OTHER PREVE PROOF
AND AS FOR ME THOUGH THAT I KNOW BUT LITE LITTLE
ON BOOKES FOR TO READ I ME DELIGHT
AND TO THEM GIVE I FAITH AND GOOD CREDENCE
AND IN MY HEART HAVE THEM IN REVERENCE
SO HEARTILY THAT THERE IS GAME NONE 2 NO AMUSEMENT
THAT FROM MY BOOKES MAKETH ME TO GO'N
BUT IT BE SELDOM ON THE HOLYDAY
SAVE CERTAINLY WHEN THAT THE MONTH OF MAY
IS COMEN AND I HEAR THE FOWLES SING
AND THAT THE FLOWERS GINNEN FOR TO SPRING
FAREWELL MY BOOK AND MY DEVOTION
NOW HAVE I THEN SUCH A CONDITION
THAT ABOVE ALL THE FLOWERS IN THE MEAD
THEN LOVE I MOST THESE FLOWERS WHITE AND RED
SUCH THAT MEN CALLE DAY'S EYES IN OUR TOWN
TO THEM HAVE I SO GREAT AFFECTIOUN
AS I SAID ERST WHEN COMEN IS THE MAY
THAT IN MY BED THERE DAWNETH ME NO DAY
THAT I N'AM UP AND WALKING IN THE MEAD AM NOT
TO SEE THIS FLOW'R AGAINST THE SUNNE SPREAD
WHEN IT UPRISETH EARLY BY THE MORROW
THAT BLISSFUL SIGHT SOFTENETH ALL MY SORROW
SO GLAD AM I WHEN THAT I HAVE PRESENCE
OF IT TO DO IT ALLE REVERENCE
AS SHE THAT IS OF ALLE FLOWERS FLOW'R
FULFILLED OF ALL VIRTUE AND HONOUR
AND EVER ALIKE FAIR AND FRESH OF HUE
AS WELL IN WINTER AS IN SUMMER NEW
THIS LOVE I EVER AND SHALL UNTIL I DIE
ALL SWEAR I NOT OF THIS I WILL NOT LIE ALTHOUGH
THERE LOVED NO WIGHT HOTTER IN HIS LIFE
AND WHEN THAT IT IS EVE I RUNNE BLIFE QUICKLY EAGERLY
AS SOON AS EVER THE SUN BEGINS TO WEST DECLINE WESTWARD
TO SEE THIS FLOW'R HOW IT WILL GO TO REST
FOR FEAR OF NIGHT SO HATETH SHE DARKNESS
HER CHEER IS PLAINLY SPREAD IN THE BRIGHTNESS COUNTENANCE
OF THE SUNNE FOR THERE IT WILL UNCLOSE
ALAS THAT I HAD ENGLISH RHYME OR PROSE
SUFFICIENT THIS FLOW'R TO PRAISE ARIGHT
BUT HELP ME YE THAT HAVE CUNNING OR MIGHT SKILL OR POWER
YE LOVERS THAT CAN MAKE OF SENTIMENT
IN THIS CASE OUGHT YE TO BE DILIGENT
TO FURTHER ME SOMEWHAT IN MY LABOUR
WHETHER YE BE WITH THE LEAF OR THE FLOW'R 3
FOR WELL I WOT THAT YE HAVE HEREBEFORE
OF MAKING ROPEN AND LED AWAY THE CORN 4 REAPED
AND I COME AFTER GLEANING HERE AND THERE
AND AM FULL GLAD IF I MAY FIND AN EAR
OF ANY GOODLY WORD THAT YOU HAVE LEFT
AND THOUGH IT HAP ME TO REHEARSEN EFT AGAIN
WHAT YE HAVE IN YOUR FRESHE SONGES SAID
FORBEARE ME AND BE NOT EVIL APAID DISPLEASED
SINCE THAT YE SEE I DO IT IN TH'HONOUR
OF LOVE AND EKE IN SERVICE OF THE FLOW'R
WHOM THAT I SERVE AS I HAVE WIT OR MIGHT
5
SHE IS THE CLEARNESS AND THE VERY LIGHT TRUE
THAT IN THIS DARKE WORLD ME WINDS AND LEADS TURNS GUIDES
THE HEART WITHIN MY SORROWFUL BREAST YOU DREADS
AND LOVES SO SORE THAT YE BE VERILY
THE MISTRESS OF MY WIT AND NOTHING I
MY WORD MY WORKS ARE KNIT SO IN YOUR BOND
THAT AS A HARP OBEYETH TO THE HAND
THAT MAKES IT SOUND AFTER HIS FINGERING
RIGHT SO MAY YE OUT OF MY HEARTE BRING
SUCH VOICE RIGHT AS YOU LIST TO LAUGH OR PLAIN COMPLAIN MOURN
BE YE MY GUIDE AND LADY SOVEREIGN
AS TO MINE EARTHLY GOD TO YOU I CALL
BOTH IN THIS WORK AND IN MY SORROWS ALL
BUT WHEREFORE THAT I SPAKE TO GIVE CREDENCE
TO OLD STORIES AND DO THEM REVERENCE
AND THAT MEN MUSTE MORE THINGS BELIEVE
THAN THEY MAY SEE AT EYE OR ELLES PREVE PROVE
THAT SHALL I SAY WHEN THAT I SEE MY TIME
I MAY NOT ALL AT ONES SPEAK IN RHYME
MY BUSY GHOST THAT THIRSTETH ALWAYS NEW SPIRIT
TO SEE THIS FLOW'R SO YOUNG SO FRESH OF HUE
CONSTRAINED ME WITH SO GREEDY DESIRE
THAT IN MY HEART I FEELE YET THE FIRE
THAT MADE ME TO RISE ERE IT WERE DAY
AND THIS WAS NOW THE FIRST MORROW OF MAY
WITH DREADFUL HEART AND GLAD DEVOTION
FOR TO BE AT THE RESURRECTION
OF THIS FLOWER WHEN THAT IT SHOULD UNCLOSE
AGAINST THE SUN THAT ROSE AS RED AS ROSE
THAT IN THE BREAST WAS OF THE BEAST THAT DAY THE SIGN OF THE BULL
THAT AGENORE'S DAUGHTER LED AWAY
6
AND DOWN ON KNEES ANON RIGHT I ME SET
AND AS I COULD THIS FRESHE FLOW'R I GRET GREETED
KNEELING ALWAY TILL IT UNCLOSED WAS
UPON THE SMALLE SOFTE SWEETE GRASS
THAT WAS WITH FLOWERS SWEET EMBROIDER'D ALL
OF SUCH SWEETNESS AND SUCH ODOUR O'ER ALL EVERYWHERE
THAT FOR TO SPEAK OF GUM OR HERB OR TREE
COMPARISON MAY NONE Y MAKED BE
FOR IT SURMOUNTETH PLAINLY ALL ODOURS
AND FOR RICH BEAUTY THE MOST GAY OF FLOW'RS
FORGOTTEN HAD THE EARTH HIS POOR ESTATE
OF WINTER THAT HIM NAKED MADE AND MATE DEJECTED LIFELESS
AND WITH HIS SWORD OF COLD SO SORE GRIEVED
NOW HATH TH'ATTEMPER SUN ALL THAT RELEAVED TEMPERATE FURNISHED
THAT NAKED WAS AND CLAD IT NEW AGAIN
ANEW WITH LEAVES
THE SMALLE FOWLES OF THE SEASON FAIN GLAD
THAT OF THE PANTER AND THE NET BE SCAP'D DRAW NET
UPON THE FOWLER THAT THEM MADE AWHAP'D TERRIFIED CONFOUNDED
IN WINTER AND DESTROYED HAD THEIR BROOD
IN HIS DESPITE THEM THOUGHT IT DID THEM GOOD
TO SING OF HIM AND IN THEIR SONG DESPISE
THE FOULE CHURL THAT FOR HIS COVETISE GREED
HAD THEM BETRAYED WITH HIS SOPHISTRY DECEPTIONS
THIS WAS THEIR SONG THE FOWLER WE DEFY
AND ALL HIS CRAFT AND SOME SUNGE CLEAR
LAYES OF LOVE THAT JOY IT WAS TO HEAR
IN WORSHIPPING AND PRAISING OF THEIR MAKE HONOURING MATE
AND FOR THE BLISSFUL NEWE SUMMER'S SAKE
UPON THE BRANCHES FULL OF BLOSSOMS SOFT
IN THEIR DELIGHT THEY TURNED THEM FULL OFT
AND SUNGE BLESSED BE SAINT VALENTINE 7
FOR ON HIS DAY I CHOSE YOU TO BE MINE
WITHOUTE REPENTING MY HEARTE SWEET
AND THEREWITHAL THEIR HEALS BEGAN TO MEET
YIELDING HONOUR AND HUMBLE OBEISANCES
TO LOVE AND DID THEIR OTHER OBSERVANCES
THAT LONGEN UNTO LOVE AND TO NATURE
CONSTRUE THAT AS YOU LIST I DO NO CURE CARE NOTHING
AND THOSE THAT HADDE DONE UNKINDENESS COMMITTED OFFENCE
AS DOTH THE TIDIFE 8 FOR NEWFANGLENESS AGAINST NATURAL LAWS
BESOUGHTE MERCY FOR THEIR TRESPASSING
AND HUMBLELY SANGE THEIR REPENTING
AND SWORE UPON THE BLOSSOMS TO BE TRUE
SO THAT THEIR MATES WOULD UPON THEM RUE TAKE PITY
AND AT THE LASTE MADE THEIR ACCORD RECONCILIATION
ALL FOUND THEY DANGER FOR A TIME A LORD ALTHOUGH DISDAIN
YET PITY THROUGH HER STRONGE GENTLE MIGHT
FORGAVE AND MADE MERCY PASS ARIGHT
THROUGH INNOCENCE AND RULED COURTESY
BUT I NE CALL NOT INNOCENCE FOLLY
NOR FALSE PITY FOR VIRTUE IS THE MEAN
AS ETHIC 9 SAITH IN SUCH MANNER I MEAN
AND THUS THESE FOWLES VOID OF ALL MALICE
ACCORDED UNTO LOVE AND LEFTE VICE
OF HATE AND SANGEN ALL OF ONE ACCORD
WELCOME SUMMER OUR GOVERNOR AND LORD
AND ZEPHYRUS AND FLORA GENTILLY
GAVE TO THE FLOWERS SOFT AND TENDERLY
THEIR SWEETE BREATH AND MADE THEM FOR TO SPREAD
AS GOD AND GODDESS OF THE FLOW'RY MEAD
IN WHICH ME THOUGHT I MIGHTE DAY BY DAY
DWELLEN ALWAY THE JOLLY MONTH OF MAY
WITHOUTE SLEEP WITHOUTE MEAT OR DRINK
ADOWN FULL SOFTLY I BEGAN TO SINK
AND LEANING ON MINE ELBOW AND MY SIDE
THE LONGE DAY I SHOPE TO ABIDE RESOLVED PREPARED
FOR NOTHING ELLES AND I SHALL NOT LIE
BUT FOR TO LOOK UPON THE DAISY
THAT MEN BY REASON WELL IT CALLE MAY
THE DAYE'S EYE OR ELSE THE EYE OF DAY
THE EMPRESS AND THE FLOW'R OF FLOWERS ALL
I PRAY TO GOD THAT FAIRE MAY SHE FALL
AND ALL THAT LOVE FLOWERS FOR HER SAKE
BUT NATHELESSE WEEN NOT THAT I MAKE DO NOT FANCY THAT I
IN PRAISING OF THE FLOW'R AGAINST THE LEAF WRITE THIS POEM
NO MORE THAN OF THE CORN AGAINST THE SHEAF
FOR AS TO ME IS LEVER NONE NOR LOTHER
I N'AM WITHHOLDEN YET WITH NEITHER N'OTHER 10
NOR I N'OT WHO SERVES LEAF NOR WHO THE FLOW'R NOR DO I KNOW
WELL BROOKE THEY THEIR SERVICE OR LABOUR MAY THEY PROFIT BY
FOR THIS THING IS ALL OF ANOTHER TUN 11
OF OLD STORY ERE SUCH THING WAS BEGUN
WHEN THAT THE SUN OUT OF THE SOUTH GAN WEST
AND THAT THIS FLOW'R GAN CLOSE AND GO TO REST
FOR DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT THE WHICH SHE DREAD DREADED
HOME TO MY HOUSE FULL SWIFTLY I ME SPED
TO GO TO REST AND EARLY FOR TO RISE
TO SEE THIS FLOWER SPREAD AS I DEVISE DESCRIBE
AND IN A LITTLE ARBOUR THAT I HAVE
THAT BENCHED WAS OF TURFES FRESH Y GRAVE 12 CUT OUT
I BADE MEN SHOULDE ME MY COUCHE MAKE
FOR DAINTY OF THE NEWE SUMMER'S SAKE PLEASURE
I BADE THEM STROWE FLOWERS ON MY BED
WHEN I WAS LAID AND HAD MINE EYEN HID
I FELL ASLEEP WITHIN AN HOUR OR TWO
ME METTE HOW I LAY IN THE MEADOW THO DREAMED THEN
TO SEE THIS FLOW'R THAT I LOVE SO AND DREAD
AND FROM AFAR CAME WALKING IN THE MEAD
THE GOD OF LOVE AND IN HIS HAND A QUEEN
AND SHE WAS CLAD IN ROYAL HABIT GREEN
A FRET OF GOLD SHE HADDE NEXT HER HAIR BAND
AND UPON THAT A WHITE COROWN SHE BARE
WITH FLOWRONS SMALL AND AS I SHALL NOT LIE FLORETS 13
FOR ALL THE WORLD RIGHT AS A DAISY
Y CROWNED IS WITH WHITE LEAVES LITE SMALL
SO WERE THE FLOWRONS OF HER CROWNE WHITE
FOR OF ONE PEARLE FINE ORIENTIAL
HER WHITE CROWNE WAS Y MAKED ALL
FOR WHICH THE WHITE CROWN ABOVE THE GREEN
MADE HER LIKE A DAISY FOR TO SEE'N LOOK UPON
CONSIDER'D EKE HER FRET OF GOLD ABOVE
Y CLOTHED WAS THIS MIGHTY GOD OF LOVE
IN SILK EMBROIDER'D FULL OF GREENE GREVES BOUGHS
IN WHICH THERE WAS A FRET OF RED ROSE LEAVES
THE FRESHEST SINCE THE WORLD WAS FIRST BEGUN
HIS GILT HAIR WAS Y CROWNED WITH A SUN
LNSTEAD OF GOLD FOR HEAVINESS AND WEIGHT TO AVOID
THEREWITH ME THOUGHT HIS FACE SHONE SO BRIGHT
THAT WELL UNNETHES MIGHT I HIM BEHOLD
AND IN HIS HAND ME THOUGHT I SAW HIM HOLD
TWO FIERY DARTES AS THE GLEDES RED GLOWING COALS
AND ANGEL LIKE HIS WINGES SAW I SPREAD
AND ALL BE THAT MEN SAY THAT BLIND IS HE ALTHOUGH
ALGATE ME THOUGHTE THAT HE MIGHT WELL SEE AT ALL EVENTS
FOR STERNLY UPON ME HE GAN BEHOLD
SO THAT HIS LOOKING DID MY HEARTE COLD MADE MY HEART
AND BY THE HAND HE HELD THIS NOBLE QUEEN GROW COLD
CROWNED WITH WHITE AND CLOTHED ALL IN GREEN
SO WOMANLY SO BENIGN AND SO MEEK
THAT IN THIS WORLDE THOUGH THAT MEN WOULD SEEK
HALF OF HER BEAUTY SHOULDE THEY NOT FIND
IN CREATURE THAT FORMED IS BY KIND NATURE
AND THEREFORE MAY I SAY AS THINKETH ME
THIS SONG IN PRAISING OF THIS LADY FREE
HIDE ABSOLON THY GILTE TRESSES CLEAR GOLDEN
ESTHER LAY THOU THY MEEKNESS ALL ADOWN
HIDE JONATHAN ALL THY FRIENDLY MANNERE
PENELOPE AND MARCIA CATOUN 14

MY LADY COMES THAT ALL THIS MAY DISTAIN OUTDO OBSCURE
THY FAIRE BODY LET IT NOT APPEAR

HIDE YE YOUR TRUTH OF LOVE AND YOUR RENOWN
AND THOU THISBE THAT HADST OF LOVE SUCH PAIN
MY LADY COMES THAT ALL THIS MAY DISTAIN
HERO DIDO LAODAMIA Y FERE TOGETHER
AND PHYLLIS HANGING FOR DEMOPHOON

AS I HAVE SAID ERST BY MY LADY FREE
FOR CERTAINLY ALL THESE MAY NOT SUFFICE
T'APPAIRE WITH MY LADY IN NO WISE SURPASS IN BEAUTY

SO PASSETH ALL MY LADY SOVEREIGN
THAT IS SO GOOD SO FAIR SO DEBONAIR
I PRAY TO GOD THAT EVER FALL HER FAIR
FOR N'HADDE COMFORT BEEN OF HER PRESENCE HAD I NOT THE
I HAD BEEN DEAD WITHOUT ANY DEFENCE COMFORT OF
FOR DREAD OF LOVE'S WORDES AND HIS CHEER
AS WHEN TIME IS HEREAFTER YE SHALL HEAR
BEHIND THIS GOD OF LOVE UPON THE GREEN
I SAW COMING OF LADIES NINETEEN
IN ROYAL HABIT A FULL EASY PACE
AND AFTER THEM OF WOMEN SUCH A TRACE TRAIN
THAT SINCE THAT GOD ADAM HAD MADE OF EARTH
THE THIRDE PART OF MANKIND OR THE FERTH FOURTH
NE WEEN'D I NOT BY POSSIBILITY I NEVER FANCIED
HAD EVER IN THIS WIDE WORLD Y BE BEEN
AND TRUE OF LOVE THESE WOMEN WERE EACH ONE
NOW WHETHER WAS THAT A WONDER THING OR NON NOT
THAT RIGHT ANON AS THAT THEY GAN ESPY
THIS FLOW'R WHICH THAT I CALL THE DAISY
FULL SUDDENLY THEY STENTEN ALL AT ONCE STOPPED
AND KNEELED DOWN AS IT WERE FOR THE NONCE
AND SANGE WITH ONE VOICE HEAL AND HONOUR
TO TRUTH OF WOMANHEAD AND TO THIS FLOW'R
THAT BEARS OUR ALLER PRIZE IN FIGURING THAT IN ITS FIGURE BEARS
HER WHITE CROWNE BEARS THE WITNESSING THE PRIZE FROM US ALL
AND WITH THAT WORD A COMPASS ENVIROUN ALL AROUND IN A RING
THEY SETTE THEM FULL SOFTELY ADOWN
FIRST SAT THE GOD OF LOVE AND SINCE HIS QUEEN AFTERWARDS
WITH THE WHITE COROWNE CLAD IN GREEN
AND SITHEN ALL THE REMNANT BY AND BY THEN
AS THEY WERE OF ESTATE FULL COURTEOUSLY
AND NOT A WORD WAS SPOKEN IN THE PLACE
THE MOUNTANCE OF A FURLONG WAY OF SPACE
EXTENT 18
I KNEELING BY THIS FLOW'R IN GOOD INTENT
ABODE TO KNOWE WHAT THIS PEOPLE MEANT
AS STILL AS ANY STONE TILL AT THE LAST
THE GOD OF LOVE ON ME HIS EYEN CAST
AND SAID WHO KNEELETH THERE AND I ANSWER'D
UNTO HIS ASKING WHEN THAT I IT HEARD
AND SAID IT AM I AND CAME TO HIM NEAR
AND SALUED HIM
QUOTH HE WHAT DOST THOU HERE SALUTED

IT IS MY RELIC DIGN AND DELECTABLE EMBLEM 19 WORTHY
AND THOU MY FOE AND ALL MY FOLK WARRAYEST MOLESTEST CENSUREST
AND OF MINE OLDE SERVANTS THOU MISSAYEST
AND HIND'REST THEM WITH THY TRANSLATION
AND LETTEST FOLK FROM THEIR DEVOTION PREVENTEST
TO SERVE ME AND HOLDEST IT FOLLY
TO SERVE LOVE THOU MAY'ST IT NOT DENY
FOR IN PLAIN TEXT WITHOUTE NEED OF GLOSE COMMENT GLOSS
THU HAST TRANSLATED THE ROMANCE OF THE ROSE
THAT IS A HERESY AGAINST MY LAW
AND MAKETH WISE FOLK FROM ME WITHDRAW
AND OF CRESSIDE THOU HAST SAID AS THEE LIST
THAT MAKETH MEN TO WOMEN LESS TO TRUST
THAT BE AS TRUE AS E'ER WAS ANY STEEL
OF THINE ANSWER ADVISE THEE RIGHT WEEL CONSIDER RIGHT WELL
FOR THOUGH THAT THOU RENIED HAST MY LAY ABJURED MY LAW
AS OTHER WRETCHES HAVE DONE MANY A DAY OR RELIGION
BY SAINTE VENUS THAT MY MOTHER IS
IF THAT THOU LIVE THOU SHALT REPENTE THIS
SO CRUELLY THAT IT SHALL WELL BE SEEN
THEN SPAKE THIS LADY CLOTHED ALL IN GREEN
AND SAIDE GOD RIGHT OF YOUR COURTESY
YE MIGHTE HEARKEN IF HE CAN REPLY
AGAINST ALL THIS THAT YE HAVE TO HIM MEVED ADVANCED AGAINST HIM
A GODDE SHOULDE NOT BE THUS AGGRIEVED
BUT OF HIS DEITY HE SHALL BE STABLE
AND THERETO GRACIOUS AND MERCIABLE MERCIFUL
AND IF YE N'ERE A GOD THAT KNOWETH ALL WERE NOT
THEN MIGHT IT BE AS I YOU TELLE SHALL
THIS MAN TO YOU MAY FALSELY BE ACCUSED
WHEREAS BY RIGHT HIM OUGHT TO BE EXCUSED
FOR IN YOUR COURT IS MANY A LOSENGEOUR DECEIVER 20
AND MANY A QUAINT TOTELER ACCUSOUR STRANGE PRATING ACCUSER 21
THAT TABOUR IN YOUR EARES MANY A SOUN' DRUM
RIGHT AFTER THEIR IMAGINATIOUN
TO HAVE YOUR DALLIANCE AND FOR ENVY PLEASANT CONVERSATION
THESE BE THE CAUSES AND I SHALL NOT LIE COMPANY
ENVY IS LAVENDER OF THE COURT ALWAY LAUNDRESS
FOR SHE DEPARTETH NEITHER NIGHT NOR DAY 22
OUT OF THE HOUSE OF CAESAR THUS SAITH DANT'
WHOSO THAT GO'TH ALGATE SHE SHALL NOT WANT
AT ALL EVENTS
AND EKE PARAUNTRE FOR THIS MAN IS NICE PERADVENTURE FOOLISH
HE MIGHTE DO IT GUESSING NO MALICE THINKING
FOR HE USETH THINGES FOR TO MAKE COMPOSE POETRY
HIM RECKETH NAUGHT OF WHAT MATTERE HE TAKE CARES NOTHING FOR
OR HE WAS BIDDEN MAKE THILKE TWAY COMPOSE THOSE TWO
OF SOME PERSON AND DURST IT NOT WITHSAY BY REFUSE DENY
OR HIM REPENTETH UTTERLY OF THIS
HE HATH NOT DONE SO GRIEVOUSLY AMISS
TO TRANSLATE WHAT OLDE CLERKES WRITE
AS THOUGH THAT HE OF MALICE WOULD ENDITE WRITE DOWN
DESPITE OF LOVE AND HAD HIMSELF IT WROUGHT
CONTEMPT FOR
THIS SHOULD A RIGHTEOUS LORD HAVE IN HIS THOUGHT
AND NOT BE LIKE TYRANTS OF LOMBARDY
THAT HAVE NO REGARD BUT AT TYRANNY
FOR HE THAT KING OR LORD IS NATUREL
HIM OUGHTE NOT BE TYRANT OR CRUEL 23
AS IS A FARMER 24 TO DO THE HARM HE CAN
HE MUSTE THINK IT IS HIS LIEGEMAN
AND IS HIS TREASURE AND HIS GOLD IN COFFER
THIS IS THE SENTENCE OF THE PHILOSOPHER OPINION SENTIMENT
A KING TO KEEP HIS LIEGES IN JUSTICE
WITHOUTE DOUBTE THAT IS HIS OFFICE
ALL WILL HE KEEP HIS LORDS IN THEIR DEGREE ALTHOUGH
AS IT IS RIGHT AND SKILFUL THAT THEY BE REASONABLE
ENHANCED AND HONOURED AND MOST DEAR
FOR THEY BE HALFE IN THIS WORLD HERE DEMIGODS
YET MUST HE DO BOTH RIGHT TO POOR AND RICH
ALL BE THAT THEIR ESTATE BE NOT Y LICH ALIKE
AND HAVE OF POORE FOLK COMPASSION
FOR LO THE GENTLE KIND OF THE LION
FOR WHEN A FLY OFFENDETH HIM OR BITETH
HE WITH HIS TAIL AWAY THE FLYE SMITETH
ALL EASILY FOR OF HIS GENTERY NOBLENESS
HIM DEIGNETH NOT TO WREAK HIM ON A FLY
AS DOTH A CUR OR ELSE ANOTHER BEAST
IN NOBLE CORAGE OUGHT TO BE ARREST IN A NOBLE NATURE OUGHT
AND WEIGHEN EV'RYTHING BY EQUITY TO BE SELF RESTRAINT
AND EVER HAVE REGARD TO HIS DEGREE
FOR SIR IT IS NO MASTERY FOR A LORD
TO DAMN A MAN WITHOUT ANSWER OF WORD CONDEMN
AND FOR A LORD THAT IS FULL FOUL TO USE MOST INFAMOUS PRACTICE
AND IT BE SO HE MAY HIM NOT EXCUSE THE OFFENDER
BUT ASKETH MERCY WITH A DREADFUL HEART FEARING TIMID
AND PROFFERETH HIM RIGHT IN HIS BARE SHIRT
TO BE RIGHT AT YOUR OWEN JUDGEMENT
THEN OUGHT A GOD BY SHORT ADVISEMENT DELIBERATION
CONSIDER HIS OWN HONOUR AND HIS TRESPASS
FOR SINCE NO POW'R OF DEATH LIES IN THIS CASE
YOU OUGHT TO BE THE LIGHTER MERCIABLE
LETTE YOUR IRE AND BE SOMEWHAT TRACTABLE RESTRAIN
THIS MAN HATH SERVED YOU OF HIS CUNNING ABILITY SKILL
AND FURTHER'D WELL YOUR LAW IN HIS MAKING COMPOSING POETRY
ALBEIT THAT HE CANNOT WELL ENDITE
YET HATH HE MADE LEWED FOLK DELIGHT IGNORANT
TO SERVE YOU IN PRAISING OF YOUR NAME
HE MADE THE BOOK THAT HIGHT THE HOUSE OF FAME
AND EKE THE DEATH OF BLANCHE THE DUCHESS
AND THE PARLIAMENT OF FOWLES AS I GUESS
AND ALL THE LOVE OF PALAMON AND ARCITE 25
OF THEBES THOUGH THE STORY IS KNOWN LITE LITTLE
AND MANY A HYMNE FOR YOUR HOLYDAYS
THAT HIGHTE BALLADS ROUNDELS VIRELAYS
AND FOR TO SPEAK OF OTHER HOLINESS
HE HATH IN PROSE TRANSLATED BOECE 26
AND MADE THE LIFE ALSO OF SAINT CECILE
HE MADE ALSO GONE IS A GREATE WHILE
ORIGENES UPON THE MAGDALENE
27
HIM OUGHTE NOW TO HAVE THE LESSE PAIN PENALTY
HE HATH MADE MANY A LAY AND MANY A THING
NOW AS YE BE A GOD AND EKE A KING
I YOUR ALCESTIS 28 WHILOM QUEEN OF THRACE
I ASKE YOU THIS MAN RIGHT OF YOUR GRACE
THAT YE HIM NEVER HURT IN ALL HIS LIFE
AND HE SHALL SWEARE TO YOU AND THAT BLIFE QUICKLY
HE SHALL NO MORE AGUILTEN IN THIS WISE OFFEND
BUT SHALL MAKEN AS YE WILL HIM DEVISE
OF WOMEN TRUE IN LOVING ALL THEIR LIFE
WHERESO YE WILL OF MAIDEN OR OF WIFE
AND FURTHER YOU AS MUCH AS HE MISSAID
OR IN THE ROSE OR ELLES IN CRESSEIDE EITHER
THE GOD OF LOVE ANSWERED HER ANON
MADAME QUOTH HE IT IS SO LONG AGONE
THAT I YOU KNEW SO CHARITABLE AND TRUE
THAT NEVER YET SINCE THAT THE WORLD WAS NEW
TO ME NE FOUND I BETTER NONE THAN YE
IF THAT I WOULDE SAVE MY DEGREE
I MAY NOR WILL NOT WARNE YOUR REQUEST REFUSE
ALL LIES IN YOU DO WITH HIM AS YOU LEST
I ALL FORGIVE WITHOUTE LONGER SPACE DELAY
FOR HE WHO GIVES A GIFT OR DOTH A GRACE
DO IT BETIMES HIS THANK IS WELL THE MORE 29
AND DEEME YE WHAT HE SHALL DO THEREFOR
ADJUDGE
GO THANKE NOW MY LADY HERE QUOTH HE
I ROSE AND DOWN I SET ME ON MY KNEE
AND SAIDE THUS MADAME THE GOD ABOVE
FORYIELDE YOU THAT YE THE GOD OF LOVE REWARD
HAVE MADE ME HIS WRATHE TO FORGIVE
AND GRACE SO LONGE FOR TO LIVE GIVE ME GRACE
THAT I MAY KNOWE SOOTHLY WHAT YE BE
THAT HAVE ME HELP'D AND PUT IN THIS DEGREE
BUT TRUELY I WEEN'D AS IN THIS CASE
NAUGHT T' HAVE AGUILT NOR DONE TO LOVE TRESPASS OFFENDED
FOR WHY A TRUE MAN WITHOUTE DREAD OFFENCE
HATH NOT TO PARTE WITH A THIEVE'S DEED
ANY SHARE IN
NOR A TRUE LOVER OUGHTE ME TO BLAME
THOUGH THAT I SPOKE A FALSE LOVER SOME SHAME
THEY OUGHTE RATHER WITH ME FOR TO HOLD
FOR THAT I OF CRESSIDA WROTE OR TOLD
OR OF THE ROSE WHAT SO MINE AUTHOR MEANT MADE A TRUE TRANSLATION
ALGATE GOD WOT IT WAS MINE INTENT BY ALL WAYS
TO FURTHER TRUTH IN LOVE AND IT CHERICE CHERISH
AND TO BEWARE FROM FALSENESS AND FROM VICE
BY SUCH EXAMPLE THIS WAS MY MEANING
AND SHE ANSWER'D LET BE THINE ARGUING

ENVY IS LAVENDER OF THE COURT ALWAY A LAVENDER IS A
WASHERWOMAN OR LAUNDRESS THE WORD REPRESENTS MERETRICE IN
DANTE'S ORIGINAL MEANING A COURTEZAN BUT WE CAN WELL
UNDERSTAND THAT CHAUCER THOUGHT IT PRUDENT AND AT THE SAME
TIME MORE TRUE TO THE MORAL STATE OF THE ENGLISH COURT TO
CHANGE THE CHARACTER ASSIGNED TO ENVY
HE MEANS THAT ENVY IS
PERPETUALLY AT COURT LIKE SOME GARRULOUS BITTER OLD WOMAN
EMPLOYED THERE IN THE MOST SERVILE OFFICES WHO REMAINS AT HER
POST THROUGH ALL THE CHANGES AMONG THE COURTIERS

WHAT SHOULD THESE CLOTHES THUS MANIFOLD
LO THIS HOT SUMMER'S DAY
AFTER GREAT HEATE COMETH COLD
NO MAN CAST HIS PILCHE AWAY
PELISSE FURRED CLOAK
OF ALL THIS WORLD THE LARGE COMPASS
WILL NOT IN MINE ARMS TWAIN
WHO SO MUCHE WILL EMBRACE
LITTLE THEREOF HE SHALL DISTRAIN GRASP
THE WORLD SO WIDE THE AIR SO REMUABLE UNSTABLE
THE SILLY MAN SO LITTLE OF STATURE
THE GREEN OF GROUND AND CLOTHING SO MUTABLE
THE FIRE SO HOT AND SUBTILE OF NATURE
THE WATER NEVER IN ONE WHAT CREATURE NEVER THE SAME
THAT MADE IS OF THESE FOURE 2 THUS FLITTING
MAY STEADFAST BE AS HERE IN HIS LIVING
THE MORE I GO THE FARTHER I AM BEHIND
THE FARTHER BEHIND THE NEARER MY WAR'S END
THE MORE I SEEK THE WORSE CAN I FIND
THE LIGHTER LEAVE THE LOTHER FOR TO WEND 3
THE BETTER I LIVE THE MORE OUT OF MIND
IS THIS FORTUNE N'OT I OR INFORTUNE I KNOW NOT MISFORTUNE
THOUGH I GO LOOSE TIED AM I WITH A LOIGNE LINE TETHER
