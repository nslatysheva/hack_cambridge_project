CANTO I
HIS GLORY BY WHOSE MIGHT ALL THINGS ARE MOV'D
PIERCES THE UNIVERSE AND IN ONE PART
SHEDS MORE RESPLENDENCE ELSEWHERE LESS
IN HEAV'N
THAT LARGELIEST OF HIS LIGHT PARTAKES WAS I
WITNESS OF THINGS WHICH TO RELATE AGAIN
SURPASSETH POWER OF HIM WHO COMES FROM THENCE
FOR THAT SO NEAR APPROACHING ITS DESIRE
OUR INTELLECT IS TO SUCH DEPTH ABSORB'D
THAT MEMORY CANNOT FOLLOW
NATHLESS ALL
THAT IN MY THOUGHTS I OF THAT SACRED REALM
COULD STORE SHALL NOW BE MATTER OF MY SONG
BENIGN APOLLO THIS LAST LABOUR AID
AND MAKE ME SUCH A VESSEL OF THY WORTH
AS THY OWN LAUREL CLAIMS OF ME BELOV'D
THUS FAR HATH ONE OF STEEP PARNASSUS' BROWS
SUFFIC'D ME HENCEFORTH THERE IS NEED OF BOTH
FOR MY REMAINING ENTERPRISE DO THOU
ENTER INTO MY BOSOM AND THERE BREATHE
SO AS WHEN MARSYAS BY THY HAND WAS DRAGG'D
FORTH FROM HIS LIMBS UNSHEATH'D
O POWER DIVINE
IF THOU TO ME OF SHINE IMPART SO MUCH
THAT OF THAT HAPPY REALM THE SHADOW'D FORM
TRAC'D IN MY THOUGHTS I MAY SET FORTH TO VIEW
THOU SHALT BEHOLD ME OF THY FAVOUR'D TREE
COME TO THE FOOT AND CROWN MYSELF WITH LEAVES
FOR TO THAT HONOUR THOU AND MY HIGH THEME
WILL FIT ME
IF BUT SELDOM MIGHTY SIRE
TO GRACE HIS TRIUMPH GATHERS THENCE A WREATH
CAESAR OR BARD MORE SHAME FOR HUMAN WILLS
DEPRAV'D JOY TO THE DELPHIC GOD MUST SPRING
FROM THE PIERIAN FOLIAGE WHEN ONE BREAST
IS WITH SUCH THIRST INSPIR'D
FROM A SMALL SPARK
GREAT FLAME HATH RISEN AFTER ME PERCHANCE
OTHERS WITH BETTER VOICE MAY PRAY AND GAIN
FROM THE CIRRHAEAN CITY ANSWER KIND
THROUGH DIVER PASSAGES THE WORLD'S BRIGHT LAMP
RISES TO MORTALS BUT THROUGH THAT WHICH JOINS
FOUR CIRCLES WITH THE THREEFOLD CROSS IN BEST
COURSE AND IN HAPPIEST CONSTELLATION SET
HE COMES AND TO THE WORLDLY WAX BEST GIVES
ITS TEMPER AND IMPRESSION
MORNING THERE
HERE EVE WAS BY ALMOST SUCH PASSAGE MADE
AND WHITENESS HAD O'ERSPREAD THAT HEMISPHERE
BLACKNESS THE OTHER PART WHEN TO THE LEFT
I SAW BEATRICE TURN'D AND ON THE SUN
GAZING AS NEVER EAGLE FIX'D HIS KEN
AS FROM THE FIRST A SECOND BEAM IS WONT
TO ISSUE AND REFLECTED UPWARDS RISE
E'EN AS A PILGRIM BENT ON HIS RETURN
SO OF HER ACT THAT THROUGH THE EYESIGHT PASS'D
INTO MY FANCY MINE WAS FORM'D AND STRAIGHT
BEYOND OUR MORTAL WONT I FIX'D MINE EYES
UPON THE SUN
MUCH IS ALLOWED US THERE
THAT HERE EXCEEDS OUR POW'R THANKS TO THE PLACE
MADE FOR THE DWELLING OF THE HUMAN KIND
I SUFFER'D IT NOT LONG AND YET SO LONG
THAT I BEHELD IT BICK'RING SPARKS AROUND
AS IRON THAT COMES BOILING FROM THE FIRE
AND SUDDENLY UPON THE DAY APPEAR'D
A DAY NEW RIS'N AS HE WHO HATH THE POWER
HAD WITH ANOTHER SUN BEDECK'D THE SKY
HER EYES FAST FIX'D ON THE ETERNAL WHEELS
BEATRICE STOOD UNMOV'D AND I WITH KEN
FIX'D UPON HER FROM UPWARD GAZE REMOV'D
AT HER ASPECT SUCH INWARDLY BECAME
AS GLAUCUS WHEN HE TASTED OF THE HERB
THAT MADE HIM PEER AMONG THE OCEAN GODS
WORDS MAY NOT TELL OF THAT TRANSHUMAN CHANGE
AND THEREFORE LET THE EXAMPLE SERVE THOUGH WEAK
FOR THOSE WHOM GRACE HATH BETTER PROOF IN STORE
IF I WERE ONLY WHAT THOU DIDST CREATE
THEN NEWLY LOVE BY WHOM THE HEAV'N IS RUL'D
THOU KNOW'ST WHO BY THY LIGHT DIDST BEAR ME UP
WHENAS THE WHEEL WHICH THOU DOST EVER GUIDE
DESIRED SPIRIT WITH ITS HARMONY
TEMPER'D OF THEE AND MEASUR'D CHARM'D MINE EAR
THEN SEEM'D TO ME SO MUCH OF HEAV'N TO BLAZE
WITH THE SUN'S FLAME THAT RAIN OR FLOOD NE'ER MADE
A LAKE SO BROAD
THE NEWNESS OF THE SOUND
AND THAT GREAT LIGHT INFLAM'D ME WITH DESIRE
KEENER THAN E'ER WAS FELT TO KNOW THEIR CAUSE
WHENCE SHE WHO SAW ME CLEARLY AS MYSELF
TO CALM MY TROUBLED MIND BEFORE I ASK'D
OPEN'D HER LIPS AND GRACIOUS THUS BEGAN
WITH FALSE IMAGINATION THOU THYSELF
MAK'ST DULL SO THAT THOU SEEST NOT THE THING
WHICH THOU HADST SEEN HAD THAT BEEN SHAKEN OFF
THOU ART NOT ON THE EARTH AS THOU BELIEV'ST
FOR LIGHT'NING SCAP'D FROM ITS OWN PROPER PLACE
NE'ER RAN AS THOU HAST HITHER NOW RETURN'D
ALTHOUGH DIVESTED OF MY FIRST RAIS'D DOUBT
BY THOSE BRIEF WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH SMILES
YET IN NEW DOUBT WAS I ENTANGLED MORE
AND SAID ALREADY SATISFIED I REST
FROM ADMIRATION DEEP BUT NOW ADMIRE
HOW I ABOVE THOSE LIGHTER BODIES RISE
WHENCE AFTER UTT'RANCE OF A PITEOUS SIGH
SHE TOW'RDS ME BENT HER EYES WITH SUCH A LOOK
AS ON HER FRENZIED CHILD A MOTHER CASTS
THEN THUS BEGAN AMONG THEMSELVES ALL THINGS
HAVE ORDER AND FROM HENCE THE FORM WHICH MAKES
THE UNIVERSE RESEMBLE GOD
IN THIS
THE HIGHER CREATURES SEE THE PRINTED STEPS
OF THAT ETERNAL WORTH WHICH IS THE END
WHITHER THE LINE IS DRAWN
ALL NATURES LEAN
IN THIS THEIR ORDER DIVERSELY SOME MORE
SOME LESS APPROACHING TO THEIR PRIMAL SOURCE
THUS THEY TO DIFFERENT HAVENS ARE MOV'D ON
THROUGH THE VAST SEA OF BEING AND EACH ONE
WITH INSTINCT GIV'N THAT BEARS IT IN ITS COURSE
THIS TO THE LUNAR SPHERE DIRECTS THE FIRE
THIS PROMPTS THE HEARTS OF MORTAL ANIMALS
THIS THE BRUTE EARTH TOGETHER KNITS AND BINDS
NOR ONLY CREATURES VOID OF INTELLECT
ARE AIM'D AT BY THIS BOW BUT EVEN THOSE
THAT HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND LOVE ARE PIERC'D
THAT PROVIDENCE WHO SO WELL ORDERS ALL
WITH HER OWN LIGHT MAKES EVER CALM THE HEAVEN
IN WHICH THE SUBSTANCE THAT HATH GREATEST SPEED
IS TURN'D AND THITHER NOW AS TO OUR SEAT
PREDESTIN'D WE ARE CARRIED BY THE FORCE
OF THAT STRONG CORD THAT NEVER LOOSES DART
BUT AT FAIR AIM AND GLAD
YET IS IT TRUE
THAT AS OFTTIMES BUT ILL ACCORDS THE FORM
TO THE DESIGN OF ART THROUGH SLUGGISHNESS
OF UNREPLYING MATTER SO THIS COURSE
IS SOMETIMES QUITTED BY THE CREATURE WHO
HATH POWER DIRECTED THUS TO BEND ELSEWHERE
AS FROM A CLOUD THE FIRE IS SEEN TO FALL
FROM ITS ORIGINAL IMPULSE WARP'D TO EARTH
BY VICIOUS FONDNESS
THOU NO MORE ADMIRE
THY SOARING IF I RIGHTLY DEEM THAN LAPSE
OF TORRENT DOWNWARDS FROM A MOUNTAIN'S HEIGHT
THERE WOULD IN THEE FOR WONDER BE MORE CAUSE
IF FREE OF HIND'RANCE THOU HADST FIX'D THYSELF
BELOW LIKE FIRE UNMOVING ON THE EARTH
SO SAID SHE TURN'D TOWARD THE HEAV'N HER FACE
CANTO II
ALL YE WHO IN SMALL BARK HAVE FOLLOWING SAIL'D
EAGER TO LISTEN ON THE ADVENT'ROUS TRACK
OF MY PROUD KEEL THAT SINGING CUTS ITS WAY
BACKWARD RETURN WITH SPEED AND YOUR OWN SHORES
REVISIT NOR PUT OUT TO OPEN SEA
WHERE LOSING ME PERCHANCE YE MAY REMAIN
BEWILDER'D IN DEEP MAZE
THE WAY I PASS
NE'ER YET WAS RUN MINERVA BREATHES THE GALE
APOLLO GUIDES ME AND ANOTHER NINE
TO MY RAPT SIGHT THE ARCTIC BEAMS REVEAL
YE OTHER FEW WHO HAVE OUTSTRETCH'D THE NECK
TIMELY FOR FOOD OF ANGELS ON WHICH HERE
THEY LIVE YET NEVER KNOW SATIETY
THROUGH THE DEEP BRINE YE FEARLESS MAY PUT OUT
YOUR VESSEL MARKING WELL THE FURROW BROAD
BEFORE YOU IN THE WAVE THAT ON BOTH SIDES
EQUAL RETURNS
THOSE GLORIOUS WHO PASS'D O'ER
TO COLCHOS WONDER'D NOT AS YE WILL DO
WHEN THEY SAW JASON FOLLOWING THE PLOUGH
THE INCREATE PERPETUAL THIRST THAT DRAWS
TOWARD THE REALM OF GOD'S OWN FORM BORE US
SWIFT ALMOST AS THE HEAVEN YE BEHOLD
BEATRICE UPWARD GAZ'D AND I ON HER
AND IN SUCH SPACE AS ON THE NOTCH A DART
IS PLAC'D THEN LOOSEN'D FLIES I SAW MYSELF
ARRIV'D WHERE WOND'ROUS THING ENGAG'D MY SIGHT
WHENCE SHE TO WHOM NO WORK OF MINE WAS HID
TURNING TO ME WITH ASPECT GLAD AS FAIR
BESPAKE ME GRATEFULLY DIRECT THY MIND
TO GOD THROUGH WHOM TO THIS FIRST STAR WE COME
ME SEEM'D AS IF A CLOUD HAD COVER'D US
TRANSLUCENT SOLID FIRM AND POLISH'D BRIGHT
LIKE ADAMANT WHICH THE SUN'S BEAM HAD SMIT
WITHIN ITSELF THE EVER DURING PEARL
RECEIV'D US AS THE WAVE A RAY OF LIGHT
RECEIVES AND RESTS UNBROKEN
IF I THEN
WAS OF CORPOREAL FRAME AND IT TRANSCEND
OUR WEAKER THOUGHT HOW ONE DIMENSION THUS
ANOTHER COULD ENDURE WHICH NEEDS MUST BE
IF BODY ENTER BODY HOW MUCH MORE
MUST THE DESIRE INFLAME US TO BEHOLD
THAT ESSENCE WHICH DISCOVERS BY WHAT MEANS
GOD AND OUR NATURE JOIN'D THERE WILL BE SEEN
THAT WHICH WE HOLD THROUGH FAITH NOT SHOWN BY PROOF
BUT IN ITSELF INTELLIGIBLY PLAIN
E'EN AS THE TRUTH THAT MAN AT FIRST BELIEVES
I ANSWERED LADY I WITH THOUGHTS DEVOUT
SUCH AS I BEST CAN FRAME GIVE THANKS TO HIM
WHO HATH REMOV'D ME FROM THE MORTAL WORLD
BUT TELL I PRAY THEE WHENCE THE GLOOMY SPOTS
UPON THIS BODY WHICH BELOW ON EARTH
GIVE RISE TO TALK OF CAIN IN FABLING QUAINT
SHE SOMEWHAT SMIL'D THEN SPAKE IF MORTALS ERR
IN THEIR OPINION WHEN THE KEY OF SENSE
UNLOCKS NOT SURELY WONDER'S WEAPON KEEN
OUGHT NOT TO PIERCE THEE SINCE THOU FIND'ST THE WINGS
OF REASON TO PURSUE THE SENSES' FLIGHT
ARE SHORT
BUT WHAT THY OWN THOUGHT IS DECLARE
THEN I WHAT VARIOUS HERE ABOVE APPEARS
IS CAUS'D I DEEM BY BODIES DENSE OR RARE
SHE THEN RESUM'D THOU CERTAINLY WILT SEE
IN FALSEHOOD THY BELIEF O'ERWHELM'D IF WELL
THOU LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENTS WHICH I
SHALL BRING TO FACE IT
THE EIGHTH SPHERE DISPLAYS
NUMBERLESS LIGHTS THE WHICH IN KIND AND SIZE
MAY BE REMARK'D OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS
IF RARE OR DENSE OF THAT WERE CAUSE ALONE
ONE SINGLE VIRTUE THEN WOULD BE IN ALL
ALIKE DISTRIBUTED OR MORE OR LESS
DIFFERENT VIRTUES NEEDS MUST BE THE FRUITS
OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE
WILL BY THY REASONING BE DESTROY'D
BESIDE
IF RARITY WERE OF THAT DUSK THE CAUSE
WHICH THOU INQUIREST EITHER IN SOME PART
THAT PLANET MUST THROUGHOUT BE VOID NOR FED
WITH ITS OWN MATTER OR AS BODIES SHARE
THEIR FAT AND LEANNESS IN LIKE MANNER THIS
MUST IN ITS VOLUME CHANGE THE LEAVES
THE FIRST
IF IT WERE TRUE HAD THROUGH THE SUN'S ECLIPSE
BEEN MANIFESTED BY TRANSPARENCY
OF LIGHT AS THROUGH AUGHT RARE BESIDE EFFUS'D
BUT THIS IS NOT
THEREFORE REMAINS TO SEE
THE OTHER CAUSE AND IF THE OTHER FALL
ERRONEOUS SO MUST PROVE WHAT SEEM'D TO THEE
IF NOT FROM SIDE TO SIDE THIS RARITY
PASS THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT WHENCE
ITS CONTRARY NO FURTHER LETS IT PASS
AND HENCE THE BEAM THAT FROM WITHOUT PROCEEDS
MUST BE POUR'D BACK AS COLOUR COMES THROUGH GLASS
REFLECTED WHICH BEHIND IT LEAD CONCEALS
NOW WILT THOU SAY THAT THERE OF MURKIER HUE
THAN IN THE OTHER PART THE RAY IS SHOWN
BY BEING THENCE REFRACTED FARTHER BACK
FROM THIS PERPLEXITY WILL FREE THEE SOON
EXPERIENCE IF THEREOF THOU TRIAL MAKE
THE FOUNTAIN WHENCE YOUR ARTS DERIVE THEIR STREAME
THREE MIRRORS SHALT THOU TAKE AND TWO REMOVE
FROM THEE ALIKE AND MORE REMOTE THE THIRD
BETWIXT THE FORMER PAIR SHALL MEET THINE EYES
THEN TURN'D TOWARD THEM CAUSE BEHIND THY BACK
A LIGHT TO STAND THAT ON THE THREE SHALL SHINE
AND THUS REFLECTED COME TO THEE FROM ALL
THOUGH THAT BEHELD MOST DISTANT DO NOT STRETCH
A SPACE SO AMPLE YET IN BRIGHTNESS THOU
WILL OWN IT EQUALING THE REST
BUT NOW
AS UNDER SNOW THE GROUND IF THE WARM RAY
SMITES IT REMAINS DISMANTLED OF THE HUE
AND COLD THAT COVER'D IT BEFORE SO THEE
DISMANTLED IN THY MIND I WILL INFORM
WITH LIGHT SO LIVELY THAT THE TREMULOUS BEAM
SHALL QUIVER WHERE IT FALLS
WITHIN THE HEAVEN
WHERE PEACE DIVINE INHABITS CIRCLES ROUND
A BODY IN WHOSE VIRTUE DIES THE BEING
OF ALL THAT IT CONTAINS
THE FOLLOWING HEAVEN
THAT HATH SO MANY LIGHTS THIS BEING DIVIDES
THROUGH DIFFERENT ESSENCES FROM IT DISTINCT
AND YET CONTAIN'D WITHIN IT
THE OTHER ORBS
THEIR SEPARATE DISTINCTIONS VARIOUSLY
DISPOSE FOR THEIR OWN SEED AND PRODUCE APT
THUS DO THESE ORGANS OF THE WORLD PROCEED
AS THOU BEHOLDEST NOW FROM STEP TO STEP
THEIR INFLUENCES FROM ABOVE DERIVING
AND THENCE TRANSMITTING DOWNWARDS
MARK ME WELL
HOW THROUGH THIS PASSAGE TO THE TRUTH I FORD
THE TRUTH THOU LOV'ST THAT THOU HENCEFORTH ALONE
MAY'ST KNOW TO KEEP THE SHALLOWS SAFE UNTOLD
THE VIRTUE AND MOTION OF THE SACRED ORBS
AS MALLET BY THE WORKMAN'S HAND MUST NEEDS
BY BLESSED MOVERS BE INSPIR'D
THIS HEAVEN
MADE BEAUTEOUS BY SO MANY LUMINARIES
FROM THE DEEP SPIRIT THAT MOVES ITS CIRCLING SPHERE
ITS IMAGE TAKES AN IMPRESS AS A SEAL
AND AS THE SOUL THAT DWELLS WITHIN YOUR DUST
THROUGH MEMBERS DIFFERENT YET TOGETHER FORM'D
IN DIFFERENT POW'RS RESOLVES ITSELF E'EN SO
THE INTELLECTUAL EFFICACY UNFOLDS
ITS GOODNESS MULTIPLIED THROUGHOUT THE STARS
ON ITS OWN UNITY REVOLVING STILL
DIFFERENT VIRTUE COMPACT DIFFERENT
MAKES WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY IT ENLIVENS
WITH WHICH IT KNITS AS LIFE IN YOU IS KNIT
FROM ITS ORIGINAL NATURE FULL OF JOY
THE VIRTUE MINGLED THROUGH THE BODY SHINES
AS JOY THROUGH PUPIL OF THE LIVING EYE
FROM HENCE PROCEEDS THAT WHICH FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT
SEEMS DIFFERENT AND NOT FROM DENSE OR RARE
THIS IS THE FORMAL CAUSE THAT GENERATES
PROPORTION'D TO ITS POWER THE DUSK OR CLEAR
CANTO III
THAT SUN WHICH ERST WITH LOVE MY BOSOM WARM'D
HAD OF FAIR TRUTH UNVEIL'D THE SWEET ASPECT
BY PROOF OF RIGHT AND OF THE FALSE REPROOF
AND I TO OWN MYSELF CONVINC'D AND FREE
OF DOUBT AS MUCH AS NEEDED RAIS'D MY HEAD
ERECT FOR SPEECH
BUT SOON A SIGHT APPEAR'D
WHICH SO INTENT TO MARK IT HELD ME FIX'D
THAT OF CONFESSION I NO LONGER THOUGHT
AS THROUGH TRANSLUCENT AND SMOOTH GLASS OR WAVE
CLEAR AND UNMOV'D AND FLOWING NOT SO DEEP
AS THAT ITS BED IS DARK THE SHAPE RETURNS
SO FAINT OF OUR IMPICTUR'D LINEAMENTS
THAT ON WHITE FOREHEAD SET A PEARL AS STRONG
COMES TO THE EYE SUCH SAW I MANY A FACE
ALL STRETCH'D TO SPEAK FROM WHENCE I STRAIGHT CONCEIV'D
DELUSION OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH RAIS'D
BETWEEN THE MAN AND FOUNTAIN AMOROUS FLAME
SUDDEN AS I PERCEIV'D THEM DEEMING THESE
REFLECTED SEMBLANCES TO SEE OF WHOM
THEY WERE I TURN'D MINE EYES AND NOTHING SAW
THEN TURN'D THEM BACK DIRECTED ON THE LIGHT
OF MY SWEET GUIDE WHO SMILING SHOT FORTH BEAMS
FROM HER CELESTIAL EYES
WONDER NOT THOU
SHE CRY'D AT THIS MY SMILING WHEN I SEE
THY CHILDISH JUDGMENT SINCE NOT YET ON TRUTH
IT RESTS THE FOOT BUT AS IT STILL IS WONT
MAKES THEE FALL BACK IN UNSOUND VACANCY
TRUE SUBSTANCES ARE THESE WHICH THOU BEHOLD'ST
HITHER THROUGH FAILURE OF THEIR VOW EXIL'D
BUT SPEAK THOU WITH THEM LISTEN AND BELIEVE
THAT THE TRUE LIGHT WHICH FILLS THEM WITH DESIRE
PERMITS NOT FROM ITS BEAMS THEIR FEET TO STRAY
STRAIGHT TO THE SHADOW WHICH FOR CONVERSE SEEM'D
MOST EARNEST I ADDRESSED ME AND BEGAN
AS ONE BY OVER EAGERNESS PERPLEX'D
O SPIRIT BORN FOR JOY WHO IN THE RAYS
OF LIFE ETERNAL OF THAT SWEETNESS KNOW'ST
THE FLAVOUR WHICH NOT TASTED PASSES FAR
ALL APPREHENSION ME IT WELL WOULD PLEASE
IF THOU WOULDST TELL ME OF THY NAME AND THIS
YOUR STATION HERE WHENCE SHE WITH KINDNESS PROMPT
AND EYES GLIST'NING WITH SMILES OUR CHARITY
TO ANY WISH BY JUSTICE INTRODUC'D
BARS NOT THE DOOR NO MORE THAN SHE ABOVE
WHO WOULD HAVE ALL HER COURT BE LIKE HERSELF
I WAS A VIRGIN SISTER IN THE EARTH
AND IF THY MIND OBSERVE ME WELL THIS FORM
WITH SUCH ADDITION GRAC'D OF LOVELINESS
WILL NOT CONCEAL ME LONG BUT THOU WILT KNOW
PICCARDA IN THE TARDIEST SPHERE THUS PLAC'D
HERE 'MID THESE OTHER BLESSED ALSO BLEST
OUR HEARTS WHOSE HIGH AFFECTIONS BURN ALONE
WITH PLEASURE FROM THE HOLY SPIRIT CONCEIV'D
ADMITTED TO HIS ORDER DWELL IN JOY
AND THIS CONDITION WHICH APPEARS SO LOW
IS FOR THIS CAUSE ASSIGN'D US THAT OUR VOWS
WERE IN SOME PART NEGLECTED AND MADE VOID
WHENCE I TO HER REPLIED SOMETHING DIVINE
BEAMS IN YOUR COUNTENANCE WOND'ROUS FAIR
FROM FORMER KNOWLEDGE QUITE TRANSMUTING YOU
THEREFORE TO RECOLLECT WAS I SO SLOW
BUT WHAT THOU SAYST HATH TO MY MEMORY
GIVEN NOW SUCH AID THAT TO RETRACE YOUR FORMS
IS EASIER
YET INFORM ME YE WHO HERE
ARE HAPPY LONG YE FOR A HIGHER PLACE
MORE TO BEHOLD AND MORE IN LOVE TO DWELL
SHE WITH THOSE OTHER SPIRITS GENTLY SMIL'D
THEN ANSWER'D WITH SUCH GLADNESS THAT SHE SEEM'D
WITH LOVE'S FIRST FLAME TO GLOW BROTHER OUR WILL
IS IN COMPOSURE SETTLED BY THE POWER
OF CHARITY WHO MAKES US WILL ALONE
WHAT WE POSSESS AND NOUGHT BEYOND DESIRE
IF WE SHOULD WISH TO BE EXALTED MORE
THEN MUST OUR WISHES JAR WITH THE HIGH WILL
OF HIM WHO SETS US HERE WHICH IN THESE ORBS
THOU WILT CONFESS NOT POSSIBLE IF HERE
TO BE IN CHARITY MUST NEEDS BEFALL
AND IF HER NATURE WELL THOU CONTEMPLATE
RATHER IT IS INHERENT IN THIS STATE
OF BLESSEDNESS TO KEEP OURSELVES WITHIN
THE DIVINE WILL BY WHICH OUR WILLS WITH HIS
ARE ONE
SO THAT AS WE FROM STEP TO STEP
ARE PLAC'D THROUGHOUT THIS KINGDOM PLEASES ALL
E'EN AS OUR KING WHO IN US PLANTS HIS WILL
AND IN HIS WILL IS OUR TRANQUILLITY
IT IS THE MIGHTY OCEAN WHITHER TENDS
WHATEVER IT CREATES AND NATURE MAKES
THEN SAW I CLEARLY HOW EACH SPOT IN HEAV'N
IS PARADISE THOUGH WITH LIKE GRACIOUS DEW
THE SUPREME VIRTUE SHOW'R NOT OVER ALL
BUT AS IT CHANCES IF ONE SORT OF FOOD
HATH SATIATED AND OF ANOTHER STILL
THE APPETITE REMAINS THAT THIS IS ASK'D
AND THANKS FOR THAT RETURN'D E'EN SO DID I
IN WORD AND MOTION BENT FROM HER TO LEARN
WHAT WEB IT WAS THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD NOT DRAWN
THE SHUTTLE TO ITS POINT
SHE THUS BEGAN
EXALTED WORTH AND PERFECTNESS OF LIFE
THE LADY HIGHER UP ENSHRINE IN HEAVEN
BY WHOSE PURE LAWS UPON YOUR NETHER EARTH
THE ROBE AND VEIL THEY WEAR TO THAT INTENT
THAT E'EN TILL DEATH THEY MAY KEEP WATCH OR SLEEP
WITH THEIR GREAT BRIDEGROOM WHO ACCEPTS EACH VOW
WHICH TO HIS GRACIOUS PLEASURE LOVE CONFORMS
FROM THE WORLD TO FOLLOW HER WHEN YOUNG
ESCAP'D AND IN HER VESTURE MANTLING ME
MADE PROMISE OF THE WAY HER SECT ENJOINS
THEREAFTER MEN FOR ILL THAN GOOD MORE APT
FORTH SNATCH'D ME FROM THE PLEASANT CLOISTER'S PALE
GOD KNOWS HOW AFTER THAT MY LIFE WAS FRAM'D
THIS OTHER SPLENDID SHAPE WHICH THOU BEHOLDST
AT MY RIGHT SIDE BURNING WITH ALL THE LIGHT
OF THIS OUR ORB WHAT OF MYSELF I TELL
MAY TO HERSELF APPLY
FROM HER LIKE ME
A SISTER WITH LIKE VIOLENCE WERE TORN
THE SAINTLY FOLDS THAT SHADED HER FAIR BROWS
E'EN WHEN SHE TO THE WORLD AGAIN WAS BROUGHT
IN SPITE OF HER OWN WILL AND BETTER WONT
YET NOT FOR THAT THE BOSOM'S INWARD VEIL
DID SHE RENOUNCE
THIS IS THE LUMINARY
OF MIGHTY CONSTANCE WHO FROM THAT LOUD BLAST
WHICH BLEW THE SECOND OVER SUABIA'S REALM
THAT POWER PRODUC'D WHICH WAS THE THIRD AND LAST
SHE CEAS'D FROM FURTHER TALK AND THEN BEGAN
AVE MARIA SINGING AND WITH THAT SONG
VANISH'D AS HEAVY SUBSTANCE THROUGH DEEP WAVE
MINE EYE THAT FAR AS IT WAS CAPABLE
PURSUED HER WHEN IN DIMNESS SHE WAS LOST
TURN'D TO THE MARK WHERE GREATER WANT IMPELL'D
AND BENT ON BEATRICE ALL ITS GAZE
BUT SHE AS LIGHT'NING BEAM'D UPON MY LOOKS
SO THAT THE SIGHT SUSTAIN'D IT NOT AT FIRST
WHENCE I TO QUESTION HER BECAME LESS PROMPT
CANTO IV
BETWEEN TWO KINDS OF FOOD BOTH EQUALLY
REMOTE AND TEMPTING FIRST A MAN MIGHT DIE
OF HUNGER ERE HE ONE COULD FREELY CHOOSE
E'EN SO WOULD STAND A LAMB BETWEEN THE MAW
OF TWO FIERCE WOLVES IN DREAD OF BOTH ALIKE
E'EN SO BETWEEN TWO DEER A DOG WOULD STAND
WHEREFORE IF I WAS SILENT FAULT NOR PRAISE
I TO MYSELF IMPUTE BY EQUAL DOUBTS
HELD IN SUSPENSE SINCE OF NECESSITY
IT HAPPEN'D
SILENT WAS I YET DESIRE
WAS PAINTED IN MY LOOKS AND THUS I SPAKE
MY WISH MORE EARNESTLY THAN LANGUAGE COULD
AS DANIEL WHEN THE HAUGHTY KING HE FREED
FROM IRE THAT SPURR'D HIM ON TO DEEDS UNJUST
AND VIOLENT SO LOOK'D BEATRICE THEN
WELL I DISCERN SHE THUS HER WORDS ADDRESS'D
HOW CONTRARY DESIRES EACH WAY CONSTRAIN THEE
SO THAT THY ANXIOUS THOUGHT IS IN ITSELF
BOUND UP AND STIFLED NOR BREATHES FREELY FORTH
THOU ARGUEST IF THE GOOD INTENT REMAIN
WHAT REASON THAT ANOTHER'S VIOLENCE
SHOULD STINT THE MEASURE OF MY FAIR DESERT
CAUSE TOO THOU FINDST FOR DOUBT IN THAT IT SEEMS
THAT SPIRITS TO THE STARS AS PLATO DEEM'D
RETURN
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH THY WILL
URGE EQUALLY AND THEREFORE I THE FIRST
OF THAT WILL TREAT WHICH HATH THE MORE OF GALL
OF SERAPHIM HE WHO IS MOST ENSKY'D
MOSES AND SAMUEL AND EITHER JOHN
CHOOSE WHICH THOU WILT NOR EVEN MARY'S SELF
HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAV'N THEIR SEATS
THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS WHICH SO LATE THOU SAW'ST
NOR MORE OR FEWER YEARS EXIST BUT ALL
MAKE THE FIRST CIRCLE BEAUTEOUS DIVERSELY
PARTAKING OF SWEET LIFE AS MORE OR LESS
AFFLATION OF ETERNAL BLISS PERVADES THEM
HERE WERE THEY SHOWN THEE NOT THAT FATE ASSIGNS
THIS FOR THEIR SPHERE BUT FOR A SIGN TO THEE
OF THAT CELESTIAL FURTHEST FROM THE HEIGHT
THUS NEEDS THAT YE MAY APPREHEND WE SPEAK
SINCE FROM THINGS SENSIBLE ALONE YE LEARN
THAT WHICH DIGESTED RIGHTLY AFTER TURNS
TO INTELLECTUAL
FOR NO OTHER CAUSE
THE SCRIPTURE CONDESCENDING GRACIOUSLY
TO YOUR PERCEPTION HANDS AND FEET TO GOD
ATTRIBUTES NOR SO MEANS AND HOLY CHURCH
DOTH REPRESENT WITH HUMAN COUNTENANCE
GABRIEL AND MICHAEL AND HIM WHO MADE
TOBIAS WHOLE
UNLIKE WHAT HERE THOU SEEST
THE JUDGMENT OF TIMAEUS WHO AFFIRMS
EACH SOUL RESTOR'D TO ITS PARTICULAR STAR
BELIEVING IT TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN THENCE
WHEN NATURE GAVE IT TO INFORM HER MOLD
SINCE TO APPEARANCE HIS INTENTION IS
E'EN WHAT HIS WORDS DECLARE OR ELSE TO SHUN
DERISION HAPLY THUS HE HATH DISGUIS'D
HIS TRUE OPINION
IF HIS MEANING BE
THAT TO THE INFLUENCING OF THESE ORBS REVERT
THE HONOUR AND THE BLAME IN HUMAN ACTS
PERCHANCE HE DOTH NOT WHOLLY MISS THE TRUTH
THIS PRINCIPLE NOT UNDERSTOOD ARIGHT
EREWHILE PERVERTED WELL NIGH ALL THE WORLD
SO THAT IT FELL TO FABLED NAMES OF JOVE
AND MERCURY AND MARS
THAT OTHER DOUBT
WHICH MOVES THEE IS LESS HARMFUL FOR IT BRINGS
NO PERIL OF REMOVING THEE FROM ME
THAT TO THE EYE OF MAN OUR JUSTICE SEEMS
UNJUST IS ARGUMENT FOR FAITH AND NOT
FOR HERETIC DECLENSION
TO THE END
THIS TRUTH MAY STAND MORE CLEARLY IN YOUR VIEW
I WILL CONTENT THEE EVEN TO THY WISH
IF VIOLENCE BE WHEN THAT WHICH SUFFERS NOUGHT
CONSENTS TO THAT WHICH FORCETH NOT FOR THIS
THESE SPIRITS STOOD EXCULPATE
FOR THE WILL
THAT WILL NOT STILL SURVIVES UNQUENCH'D AND DOTH
AS NATURE DOTH IN FIRE THO' VIOLENCE
WREST IT A THOUSAND TIMES FOR IF IT YIELD
OR MORE OR LESS SO FAR IT FOLLOWS FORCE
AND THUS DID THESE WHOM THEY HAD POWER TO SEEK
THE HALLOW'D PLACE AGAIN
IN THEM HAD WILL
BEEN PERFECT SUCH AS ONCE UPON THE BARS
HELD LAURENCE FIRM OR WROUGHT IN SCAEVOLA
TO HIS OWN HAND REMORSELESS TO THE PATH
WHENCE THEY WERE DRAWN THEIR STEPS HAD HASTEN'D BACK
WHEN LIBERTY RETURN'D BUT IN TOO FEW
RESOLVE SO STEADFAST DWELLS
AND BY THESE WORDS
IF DULY WEIGH'D THAT ARGUMENT IS VOID
WHICH OFT MIGHT HAVE PERPLEX'D THEE STILL
BUT NOW
ANOTHER QUESTION THWARTS THEE WHICH TO SOLVE
MIGHT TRY THY PATIENCE WITHOUT BETTER AID
I HAVE NO DOUBT INSTILL'D INTO THY MIND
THAT BLESSED SPIRIT MAY NOT LIE SINCE NEAR
THE SOURCE OF PRIMAL TRUTH IT DWELLS FOR AYE
AND THOU MIGHT'ST AFTER OF PICCARDA LEARN
THAT CONSTANCE HELD AFFECTION TO THE VEIL
SO THAT SHE SEEMS TO CONTRADICT ME HERE
NOT SELDOM BROTHER IT HATH CHANC'D FOR MEN
TO DO WHAT THEY HAD GLADLY LEFT UNDONE
YET TO SHUN PERIL THEY HAVE DONE AMISS
E'EN AS ALCMAEON AT HIS FATHER'S SUIT
SLEW HIS OWN MOTHER SO MADE PITILESS
NOT TO LOSE PITY
ON THIS POINT BETHINK THEE
THAT FORCE AND WILL ARE BLENDED IN SUCH WISE
AS NOT TO MAKE THE' OFFENCE EXCUSABLE
ABSOLUTE WILL AGREES NOT TO THE WRONG
THAT INASMUCH AS THERE IS FEAR OF WOE
FROM NON COMPLIANCE IT AGREES
OF WILL
THUS ABSOLUTE PICCARDA SPAKE AND I
OF TH' OTHER SO THAT BOTH HAVE TRULY SAID
SUCH WAS THE FLOW OF THAT PURE RILL THAT WELL'D
FROM FORTH THE FOUNTAIN OF ALL TRUTH AND SUCH
THE REST THAT TO MY WOND'RING THOUGHTS I FOUND
O THOU OF PRIMAL LOVE THE PRIME DELIGHT
GODDESS I STRAIGHT REPLY'D WHOSE LIVELY WORDS
STILL SHED NEW HEAT AND VIGOUR THROUGH MY SOUL
AFFECTION FAILS ME TO REQUITE THY GRACE
WITH EQUAL SUM OF GRATITUDE BE HIS
TO RECOMPENSE WHO SEES AND CAN REWARD THEE
WELL I DISCERN THAT BY THAT TRUTH ALONE
ENLIGHTEN'D BEYOND WHICH NO TRUTH MAY ROAM
OUR MIND CAN SATISFY HER THIRST TO KNOW
THEREIN SHE RESTETH E'EN AS IN HIS LAIR
THE WILD BEAST SOON AS SHE HATH REACH'D THAT BOUND
AND SHE HATH POWER TO REACH IT ELSE DESIRE
WERE GIVEN TO NO END
AND THENCE DOTH DOUBT
SPRING LIKE A SHOOT AROUND THE STOCK OF TRUTH
AND IT IS NATURE WHICH FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT
ON TO THE SUMMIT PROMPTS US
THIS INVITES
THIS DOTH ASSURE ME LADY REV'RENTLY
TO ASK THEE OF OTHER TRUTH THAT YET
IS DARK TO ME
I FAIN WOULD KNOW IF MAN
BY OTHER WORKS WELL DONE MAY SO SUPPLY
THE FAILURE OF HIS VOWS THAT IN YOUR SCALE
THEY LACK NOT WEIGHT I SPAKE AND ON ME STRAIGHT
BEATRICE LOOK'D WITH EYES THAT SHOT FORTH SPARKS
OF LOVE CELESTIAL IN SUCH COPIOUS STREAM
THAT VIRTUE SINKING IN ME OVERPOWER'D
I TURN'D AND DOWNWARD BENT CONFUS'D MY SIGHT
CANTO V
IF BEYOND EARTHLY WONT THE FLAME OF LOVE
ILLUME ME SO THAT I O'ERCOME THY POWER
OF VISION MARVEL NOT BUT LEARN THE CAUSE
IN THAT PERFECTION OF THE SIGHT WHICH SOON
AS APPREHENDING HASTENETH ON TO REACH
THE GOOD IT APPREHENDS
I WELL DISCERN
HOW IN THINE INTELLECT ALREADY SHINES
THE LIGHT ETERNAL WHICH TO VIEW ALONE
NE'ER FAILS TO KINDLE LOVE AND IF AUGHT ELSE
YOUR LOVE SEDUCES 'T IS BUT THAT IT SHOWS
SOME ILL MARK'D VESTIGE OF THAT PRIMAL BEAM
THIS WOULD'ST THOU KNOW IF FAILURE OF THE VOW
BY OTHER SERVICE MAY BE SO SUPPLIED
AS FROM SELF QUESTION TO ASSURE THE SOUL
THUS SHE HER WORDS NOT HEEDLESS OF MY WISH
BEGAN AND THUS AS ONE WHO BREAKS NOT OFF
DISCOURSE CONTINUED IN HER SAINTLY STRAIN
SUPREME OF GIFTS WHICH GOD CREATING GAVE
OF HIS FREE BOUNTY SIGN MOST EVIDENT
OF GOODNESS AND IN HIS ACCOUNT MOST PRIZ'D
WAS LIBERTY OF WILL THE BOON WHEREWITH
ALL INTELLECTUAL CREATURES AND THEM SOLE
HE HATH ENDOW'D
HENCE NOW THOU MAYST INFER
OF WHAT HIGH WORTH THE VOW WHICH SO IS FRAM'D
THAT WHEN MAN OFFERS GOD WELL PLEAS'D ACCEPTS
FOR IN THE COMPACT BETWEEN GOD AND HIM
THIS TREASURE SUCH AS I DESCRIBE IT TO THEE
HE MAKES THE VICTIM AND OF HIS OWN ACT
WHAT COMPENSATION THEREFORE MAY HE FIND
IF THAT WHEREOF THOU HAST OBLATION MADE
BY USING WELL THOU THINK'ST TO CONSECRATE
THOU WOULD'ST OF THEFT DO CHARITABLE DEED
THUS I RESOLVE THEE OF THE GREATER POINT
BUT FORASMUCH AS HOLY CHURCH HEREIN
DISPENSING SEEMS TO CONTRADICT THE TRUTH
I HAVE DISCOVER'D TO THEE YET BEHOOVES
THOU REST A LITTLE LONGER AT THE BOARD
ERE THE CRUDE ALIMENT WHICH THOU HAST TAKEN
DIGESTED FITLY TO NUTRITION TURN
OPEN THY MIND TO WHAT I NOW UNFOLD
AND GIVE IT INWARD KEEPING
KNOWLEDGE COMES
OF LEARNING WELL RETAIN'D UNFRUITFUL ELSE
THIS SACRIFICE IN ESSENCE OF TWO THINGS
CONSISTETH ONE IS THAT WHEREOF 'T IS MADE
THE COVENANT THE OTHER
FOR THE LAST
IT NE'ER IS CANCELL'D IF NOT KEPT AND HENCE
I SPAKE EREWHILE SO STRICTLY OF ITS FORCE
FOR THIS IT WAS ENJOIN'D THE ISRAELITES
THOUGH LEAVE WERE GIV'N THEM AS THOU KNOW'ST TO CHANGE
THE OFFERING STILL TO OFFER
TH' OTHER PART
THE MATTER AND THE SUBSTANCE OF THE VOW
MAY WELL BE SUCH TO THAT WITHOUT OFFENCE
IT MAY FOR OTHER SUBSTANCE BE EXCHANG'D
BUT AT HIS OWN DISCRETION NONE MAY SHIFT
THE BURDEN ON HIS SHOULDERS UNRELEAS'D
BY EITHER KEY THE YELLOW AND THE WHITE
NOR DEEM OF ANY CHANGE AS LESS THAN VAIN
IF THE LAST BOND BE NOT WITHIN THE NEW
INCLUDED AS THE QUATRE IN THE SIX
NO SATISFACTION THEREFORE CAN BE PAID
FOR WHAT SO PRECIOUS IN THE BALANCE WEIGHS
THAT ALL IN COUNTERPOISE MUST KICK THE BEAM
TAKE THEN NO VOW AT RANDOM TA'EN WITH FAITH
PRESERVE IT YET NOT BENT AS JEPHTHAH ONCE
BLINDLY TO EXECUTE A RASH RESOLVE
WHOM BETTER IT HAD SUITED TO EXCLAIM
'I HAVE DONE ILL THAN TO REDEEM HIS PLEDGE
BY DOING WORSE OR NOT UNLIKE TO HIM
IN FOLLY THAT GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS
WHENCE ON THE ALTER IPHIGENIA MOURN'D
HER VIRGIN BEAUTY AND HATH SINCE MADE MOURN
BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE EVEN ALL WHO HEAR
OF SO FELL SACRIFICE
BE YE MORE STAID
O CHRISTIANS NOT LIKE FEATHER BY EACH WIND
REMOVABLE NOR THINK TO CLEANSE OURSELVES
IN EVERY WATER
EITHER TESTAMENT
THE OLD AND NEW IS YOURS AND FOR YOUR GUIDE
THE SHEPHERD OF THE CHURCH LET THIS SUFFICE
TO SAVE YOU
WHEN BY EVIL LUST ENTIC'D
REMEMBER YE BE MEN NOT SENSELESS BEASTS
NOR LET THE JEW WHO DWELLETH IN YOUR STREETS
HOLD YOU IN MOCK'RY
BE NOT AS THE LAMB
THAT FICKLE WANTON LEAVES ITS MOTHER'S MILK
TO DALLY WITH ITSELF IN IDLE PLAY
SUCH WERE THE WORDS THAT BEATRICE SPAKE
THESE ENDED TO THAT REGION WHERE THE WORLD
IS LIVELIEST FULL OF FOND DESIRE SHE TURN'D
THOUGH MAINLY PROMPT NEW QUESTION TO PROPOSE
HER SILENCE AND CHANG'D LOOK DID KEEP ME DUMB
AND AS THE ARROW ERE THE CORD IS STILL
LEAPETH UNTO ITS MARK SO ON WE SPED
INTO THE SECOND REALM
THERE I BEHELD
THE DAME SO JOYOUS ENTER THAT THE ORB
GREW BRIGHTER AT HER SMILES AND IF THE STAR
WERE MOV'D TO GLADNESS WHAT THEN WAS MY CHEER
WHOM NATURE HATH MADE APT FOR EVERY CHANGE
AS IN A QUIET AND CLEAR LAKE THE FISH
IF AUGHT APPROACH THEM FROM WITHOUT DO DRAW
TOWARDS IT DEEMING IT THEIR FOOD SO DREW
FULL MORE THAN THOUSAND SPLENDOURS TOWARDS US
AND IN EACH ONE WAS HEARD LO ONE ARRIV'D
TO MULTIPLY OUR LOVES AND AS EACH CAME
THE SHADOW STREAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE NEW
WITNESS'D AUGMENTED JOY
HERE READER THINK
IF THOU DIDST MISS THE SEQUEL OF MY TALE
TO KNOW THE REST HOW SORELY THOU WOULDST CRAVE
AND THOU SHALT SEE WHAT VEHEMENT DESIRE
POSSESS'D ME AS SOON AS THESE HAD MET MY VIEW
TO KNOW THEIR STATE
O BORN IN HAPPY HOUR
THOU TO WHOM GRACE VOUCHSAFES OR ERE THY CLOSE
OF FLESHLY WARFARE TO BEHOLD THE THRONES
OF THAT ETERNAL TRIUMPH KNOW TO US
THE LIGHT COMMUNICATED WHICH THROUGH HEAVEN
EXPATIATES WITHOUT BOUND
THEREFORE IF AUGHT
THOU OF OUR BEAMS WOULDST BORROW FOR THINE AID
SPARE NOT AND OF OUR RADIANCE TAKE THY FILL
THUS OF THOSE PITEOUS SPIRITS ONE BESPAKE ME
AND BEATRICE NEXT SAY ON AND TRUST
AS UNTO GODS HOW IN THE LIGHT SUPREME
THOU HARBOUR'ST AND FROM THENCE THE VIRTUE BRING'ST
THAT SPARKLING IN THINE EYES DENOTES THY JOY
I MARK BUT WHO THOU ART AM STILL TO SEEK
OR WHEREFORE WORTHY SPIRIT FOR THY LOT
THIS SPHERE ASSIGN'D THAT OFT FROM MORTAL KEN
IS VEIL'D BY OTHERS' BEAMS I SAID AND TURN'D
TOWARD THE LUSTRE THAT WITH GREETING KIND
EREWHILE HAD HAIL'D ME
FORTHWITH BRIGHTER FAR
THAN ERST IT WAX'D AND AS HIMSELF THE SUN
HIDES THROUGH EXCESS OF LIGHT WHEN HIS WARM GAZE
HATH ON THE MANTLE OF THICK VAPOURS PREY'D
WITHIN ITS PROPER RAY THE SAINTLY SHAPE
WAS THROUGH INCREASE OF GLADNESS THUS CONCEAL'D
AND SHROUDED SO IN SPLENDOUR ANSWER'D ME
E'EN AS THE TENOUR OF MY SONG DECLARES
CANTO VI
AFTER THAT CONSTANTINE THE EAGLE TURN'D
AGAINST THE MOTIONS OF THE HEAV'N THAT ROLL'D
CONSENTING WITH ITS COURSE WHEN HE OF YORE
LAVINIA'S SPOUSE WAS LEADER OF THE FLIGHT
A HUNDRED YEARS TWICE TOLD AND MORE HIS SEAT
AT EUROPE'S EXTREME POINT THE BIRD OF JOVE
HELD NEAR THE MOUNTAINS WHENCE HE ISSUED FIRST
THERE UNDER SHADOW OF HIS SACRED PLUMES
SWAYING THE WORLD TILL THROUGH SUCCESSIVE HANDS
TO MINE HE CAME DEVOLV'D
CAESAR I WAS
AND AM JUSTINIAN DESTIN'D BY THE WILL
OF THAT PRIME LOVE WHOSE INFLUENCE I FEEL
FROM VAIN EXCESS TO CLEAR TH' ENCUMBER'D LAWS
OR ERE THAT WORK ENGAG'D ME I DID HOLD
CHRIST'S NATURE MERELY HUMAN WITH SUCH FAITH
CONTENTED
BUT THE BLESSED AGAPETE
WHO WAS CHIEF SHEPHERD HE WITH WARNING VOICE
TO THE TRUE FAITH RECALL'D ME
I BELIEV'D
HIS WORDS AND WHAT HE TAUGHT NOW PLAINLY SEE
AS THOU IN EVERY CONTRADICTION SEEST
THE TRUE AND FALSE OPPOS'D
SOON AS MY FEET
WERE TO THE CHURCH RECLAIM'D TO MY GREAT TASK
BY INSPIRATION OF GOD'S GRACE IMPELL'D
I GAVE ME WHOLLY AND CONSIGN'D MINE ARMS
TO BELISARIUS WITH WHOM HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND
WAS LINK'D IN SUCH CONJOINTMENT 'T WAS A SIGN
THAT I SHOULD REST
TO THY FIRST QUESTION THUS
I SHAPE MINE ANSWER WHICH WERE ENDED HERE
BUT THAT ITS TENDENCY DOTH PROMPT PERFORCE
TO SOME ADDITION THAT THOU WELL MAYST MARK
WHAT REASON ON EACH SIDE THEY HAVE TO PLEAD
BY WHOM THAT HOLIEST BANNER IS WITHSTOOD
BOTH WHO PRETEND ITS POWER AND WHO OPPOSE
BEGINNING FROM THAT HOUR WHEN PALLAS DIED
TO GIVE IT RULE BEHOLD THE VALOROUS DEEDS
HAVE MADE IT WORTHY REVERENCE
NOT UNKNOWN
TO THEE HOW FOR THREE HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE
IT DWELT IN ALBA UP TO THOSE FELL LISTS
WHERE FOR ITS SAKE WERE MET THE RIVAL THREE
NOR AUGHT UNKNOWN TO THEE WHICH IT ACHIEV'D
DOWN TO THE SABINES' WRONG TO LUCRECE' WOE
WITH ITS SEV'N KINGS CONQU'RING THE NATION ROUND
NOR ALL IT WROUGHT BY ROMAN WORTHIES HOME
'GAINST BRENNUS AND TH' EPIROT PRINCE AND HOSTS
OF SINGLE CHIEFS OR STATES IN LEAGUE COMBIN'D
OF SOCIAL WARFARE HENCE TORQUATUS STERN
AND QUINTIUS NAM'D OF HIS NEGLECTED LOCKS
THE DECII AND THE FABII HENCE ACQUIR'D
THEIR FAME WHICH I WITH DUTEOUS ZEAL EMBALM
BY IT THE PRIDE OF ARAB HORDES WAS QUELL'D
WHEN THEY LED ON BY HANNIBAL O'ERPASS'D
THE ALPINE ROCKS WHENCE GLIDE THY CURRENTS PO
BENEATH ITS GUIDANCE IN THEIR PRIME OF DAYS
SCIPIO AND POMPEY TRIUMPH'D AND THAT HILL
UNDER WHOSE SUMMIT THOU DIDST SEE THE LIGHT
RUED ITS STERN BEARING
AFTER NEAR THE HOUR
WHEN HEAV'N WAS MINDED THAT O'ER ALL THE WORLD
HIS OWN DEEP CALM SHOULD BROOD TO CAESAR'S HAND
DID ROME CONSIGN IT AND WHAT THEN IT WROUGHT
FROM VAR UNTO THE RHINE SAW ISERE'S FLOOD
SAW LOIRE AND SEINE AND EVERY VALE THAT FILLS
THE TORRENT RHONE
WHAT AFTER THAT IT WROUGHT
WHEN FROM RAVENNA IT CAME FORTH AND LEAP'D
THE RUBICON WAS OF SO BOLD A FLIGHT
THAT TONGUE NOR PEN MAY FOLLOW IT
TOW'RDS SPAIN
IT WHEEL'D ITS BANDS THEN TOW'RD DYRRACHIUM SMOTE
AND ON PHARSALIA WITH SO FIERCE A PLUNGE
E'EN THE WARM NILE WAS CONSCIOUS TO THE PANG
ITS NATIVE SHORES ANTANDROS AND THE STREAMS
OF SIMOIS REVISITED AND THERE
WHERE HECTOR LIES THEN ILL FOR PTOLEMY
HIS PENNONS SHOOK AGAIN LIGHTNING THENCE FELL
ON JUBA AND THE NEXT UPON YOUR WEST
AT SOUND OF THE POMPEIAN TRUMP RETURN'D
WHAT FOLLOWING AND IN ITS NEXT BEARER'S GRIPE
IT WROUGHT IS NOW BY CASSIUS AND BRUTUS
BARK'D OFF IN HELL AND BY PERUGIA'S SONS
AND MODENA'S WAS MOURN'D
HENCE WEEPETH STILL
SAD CLEOPATRA WHO PURSUED BY IT
TOOK FROM THE ADDER BLACK AND SUDDEN DEATH
WITH HIM IT RAN E'EN TO THE RED SEA COAST
WITH HIM COMPOS'D THE WORLD TO SUCH A PEACE
THAT OF HIS TEMPLE JANUS BARR'D THE DOOR
BUT ALL THE MIGHTY STANDARD YET HAD WROUGHT
AND WAS APPOINTED TO PERFORM THEREAFTER
THROUGHOUT THE MORTAL KINGDOM WHICH IT SWAY'D
FALLS IN APPEARANCE DWINDLED AND OBSCUR'D
IF ONE WITH STEADY EYE AND PERFECT THOUGHT
ON THE THIRD CAESAR LOOK FOR TO HIS HANDS
THE LIVING JUSTICE IN WHOSE BREATH I MOVE
COMMITTED GLORY E'EN INTO HIS HANDS
TO EXECUTE THE VENGEANCE OF ITS WRATH
HEAR NOW AND WONDER AT WHAT NEXT I TELL
AFTER WITH TITUS IT WAS SENT TO WREAK
VENGEANCE FOR VENGEANCE OF THE ANCIENT SIN
AND WHEN THE LOMBARD TOOTH WITH FANGS IMPURE
DID GORE THE BOSOM OF THE HOLY CHURCH
UNDER ITS WINGS VICTORIOUS CHARLEMAGNE
SPED TO HER RESCUE
JUDGE THEN FOR THYSELF
OF THOSE WHOM I EREWHILE ACCUS'D TO THEE
WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW GRIEVOUS THEIR OFFENDING
WHO ARE THE CAUSE OF ALL YOUR ILLS
THE ONE
AGAINST THE UNIVERSAL ENSIGN REARS
THE YELLOW LILIES AND WITH PARTIAL AIM
THAT TO HIMSELF THE OTHER ARROGATES
SO THAT 'T IS HARD TO SEE WHICH MORE OFFENDS
BE YOURS YE GHIBELLINES TO VEIL YOUR ARTS
BENEATH ANOTHER STANDARD ILL IS THIS
FOLLOW'D OF HIM WHO SEVERS IT AND JUSTICE
AND LET NOT WITH HIS GUELPHS THE NEW CROWN'D CHARLES
ASSAIL IT BUT THOSE TALONS HOLD IN DREAD
WHICH FROM A LION OF MORE LOFTY PORT
HAVE RENT THE EASING
MANY A TIME ERE NOW
THE SONS HAVE FOR THE SIRE'S TRANSGRESSION WAIL'D
NOR LET HIM TRUST THE FOND BELIEF THAT HEAV'N
WILL TRUCK ITS ARMOUR FOR HIS LILIED SHIELD
THIS LITTLE STAR IS FURNISH'D WITH GOOD SPIRITS
WHOSE MORTAL LIVES WERE BUSIED TO THAT END
THAT HONOUR AND RENOWN MIGHT WAIT ON THEM
AND WHEN DESIRES THUS ERR IN THEIR INTENTION
TRUE LOVE MUST NEEDS ASCEND WITH SLACKER BEAM
BUT IT IS PART OF OUR DELIGHT TO MEASURE
OUR WAGES WITH THE MERIT AND ADMIRE
THE CLOSE PROPORTION
HENCE DOTH HEAV'NLY JUSTICE
TEMPER SO EVENLY AFFECTION IN US
IT NE'ER CAN WARP TO ANY WRONGFULNESS
OF DIVERSE VOICES IS SWEET MUSIC MADE
SO IN OUR LIFE THE DIFFERENT DEGREES
RENDER SWEET HARMONY AMONG THESE WHEELS
WITHIN THE PEARL THAT NOW ENCLOSETH US
SHINES ROMEO'S LIGHT WHOSE GOODLY DEED AND FAIR
MET ILL ACCEPTANCE
BUT THE PROVENCALS
THAT WERE HIS FOES HAVE LITTLE CAUSE FOR MIRTH
ILL SHAPES THAT MAN HIS COURSE WHO MAKES HIS WRONG
OF OTHER'S WORTH
FOUR DAUGHTERS WERE THERE BORN
TO RAYMOND BERENGER AND EVERY ONE
BECAME A QUEEN AND THIS FOR HIM DID ROMEO
THOUGH OF MEAN STATE AND FROM A FOREIGN LAND
YET ENVIOUS TONGUES INCITED HIM TO ASK
A RECKONING OF THAT JUST ONE WHO RETURN'D
TWELVE FOLD TO HIM FOR TEN
AGED AND POOR
HE PARTED THENCE AND IF THE WORLD DID KNOW
THE HEART HE HAD BEGGING HIS LIFE BY MORSELS
'T WOULD DEEM THE PRAISE IT YIELDS HIM SCANTLY DEALT
CANTO VII
HOSANNA SANCTUS DEUS SABAOTH
SUPERILLUSTRANS CLARITATE TUA
FELICES IGNES HORUM MALAHOTH
THUS CHANTING SAW I TURN THAT SUBSTANCE BRIGHT
WITH FOURFOLD LUSTRE TO ITS ORB AGAIN
REVOLVING AND THE REST UNTO THEIR DANCE
WITH IT MOV'D ALSO AND LIKE SWIFTEST SPARKS
IN SUDDEN DISTANCE FROM MY SIGHT WERE VEIL'D
ME DOUBT POSSESS'D AND SPEAK IT WHISPER'D ME
SPEAK SPEAK UNTO THY LADY THAT SHE QUENCH
THY THIRST WITH DROPS OF SWEETNESS YET BLANK AWE
WHICH LORDS IT O'ER ME EVEN AT THE SOUND
OF BEATRICE'S NAME DID BOW ME DOWN
AS ONE IN SLUMBER HELD
NOT LONG THAT MOOD
BEATRICE SUFFER'D SHE WITH SUCH A SMILE
AS MIGHT HAVE MADE ONE BLEST AMID THE FLAMES
BEAMING UPON ME THUS HER WORDS BEGAN
THOU IN THY THOUGHT ART POND'RING AS I DEEM
AND WHAT I DEEM IS TRUTH HOW JUST REVENGE
COULD BE WITH JUSTICE PUNISH'D FROM WHICH DOUBT
I SOON WILL FREE THEE SO THOU MARK MY WORDS
FOR THEY OF WEIGHTY MATTER SHALL POSSESS THEE
THAT MAN WHO WAS UNBORN HIMSELF CONDEMN'D
AND IN HIMSELF ALL WHO SINCE HIM HAVE LIV'D
HIS OFFSPRING WHENCE BELOW THE HUMAN KIND
LAY SICK IN GRIEVOUS ERROR MANY AN AGE
UNTIL IT PLEAS'D THE WORD OF GOD TO COME
AMONGST THEM DOWN TO HIS OWN PERSON JOINING
THE NATURE FROM ITS MAKER FAR ESTRANG'D
BY THE MERE ACT OF HIS ETERNAL LOVE
CONTEMPLATE HERE THE WONDER I UNFOLD
THE NATURE WITH ITS MAKER THUS CONJOIN'D
CREATED FIRST WAS BLAMELESS PURE AND GOOD
BUT THROUGH ITSELF ALONE WAS DRIVEN FORTH
FROM PARADISE BECAUSE IT HAD ESCHEW'D
THE WAY OF TRUTH AND LIFE TO EVIL TURN'D
NE'ER THEN WAS PENALTY SO JUST AS THAT
INFLICTED BY THE CROSS IF THOU REGARD
THE NATURE IN ASSUMPTION DOOM'D NE'ER WRONG
SO GREAT IN REFERENCE TO HIM WHO TOOK
SUCH NATURE ON HIM AND ENDUR'D THE DOOM
GOD THEREFORE AND THE JEWS ONE SENTENCE PLEASED
SO DIFFERENT EFFECTS FLOW'D FROM ONE ACT
AND HEAV'N WAS OPEN'D THOUGH THE EARTH DID QUAKE
COUNT IT NOT HARD HENCEFORTH WHEN THOU DOST HEAR
THAT A JUST VENGEANCE WAS BY RIGHTEOUS COURT
JUSTLY REVENG'D
BUT YET I SEE THY MIND
BY THOUGHT ON THOUGHT ARISING SORE PERPLEX'D
AND WITH HOW VEHEMENT DESIRE IT ASKS
SOLUTION OF THE MAZE
WHAT I HAVE HEARD
IS PLAIN THOU SAYST BUT WHEREFORE GOD THIS WAY
FOR OUR REDEMPTION CHOSE ELUDES MY SEARCH
BROTHER NO EYE OF MAN NOT PERFECTED
NOR FULLY RIPEN'D IN THE FLAME OF LOVE
MAY FATHOM THIS DECREE
IT IS A MARK
IN SOOTH MUCH AIM'D AT AND BUT LITTLE KENN'D
AND I WILL THEREFORE SHOW THEE WHY SUCH WAY
WAS WORTHIEST
THE CELESTIAL LOVE THAT SPUME
ALL ENVYING IN ITS BOUNTY IN ITSELF
WITH SUCH EFFULGENCE BLAZETH AS SENDS FORTH
ALL BEAUTEOUS THINGS ETERNAL
WHAT DISTILS
IMMEDIATE THENCE NO END OF BEING KNOWS
BEARING ITS SEAL IMMUTABLY IMPRESS'D
WHATEVER THENCE IMMEDIATE FALLS IS FREE
FREE WHOLLY UNCONTROLLABLE BY POWER
OF EACH THING NEW BY SUCH CONFORMITY
MORE GRATEFUL TO ITS AUTHOR WHOSE BRIGHT BEAMS
THOUGH ALL PARTAKE THEIR SHINING YET IN THOSE
ARE LIVELIEST WHICH RESEMBLE HIM THE MOST
THESE TOKENS OF PRE EMINENCE ON MAN
LARGELY BESTOW'D IF ANY OF THEM FAIL
HE NEEDS MUST FORFEIT HIS NOBILITY
NO LONGER STAINLESS
SIN ALONE IS THAT
WHICH DOTH DISFRANCHISE HIM AND MAKE UNLIKE
TO THE CHIEF GOOD FOR THAT ITS LIGHT IN HIM
IS DARKEN'D
AND TO DIGNITY THUS LOST
IS NO RETURN UNLESS WHERE GUILT MAKES VOID
HE FOR ILL PLEASURE PAY WITH EQUAL PAIN
YOUR NATURE WHICH ENTIRELY IN ITS SEED
TRANGRESS'D FROM THESE DISTINCTIONS FELL NO LESS
THAN FROM ITS STATE IN PARADISE NOR MEANS
FOUND OF RECOVERY SEARCH ALL METHODS OUT
AS STRICKLY AS THOU MAY SAVE ONE OF THESE
THE ONLY FORDS WERE LEFT THROUGH WHICH TO WADE
EITHER THAT GOD HAD OF HIS COURTESY
RELEAS'D HIM MERELY OR ELSE MAN HIMSELF
FOR HIS OWN FOLLY BY HIMSELF ATON'D
FIX NOW THINE EYE INTENTLY AS THOU CANST
ON TH' EVERLASTING COUNSEL AND EXPLORE
INSTRUCTED BY MY WORDS THE DREAD ABYSS
MAN IN HIMSELF HAD EVER LACK'D THE MEANS
OF SATISFACTION FOR HE COULD NOT STOOP
OBEYING IN HUMILITY SO LOW
AS HIGH HE DISOBEYING THOUGHT TO SOAR
AND FOR THIS REASON HE HAD VAINLY TRIED
OUT OF HIS OWN SUFFICIENCY TO PAY
THE RIGID SATISFACTION
THEN BEHOOVED
THAT GOD SHOULD BY HIS OWN WAYS LEAD HIM BACK
UNTO THE LIFE FROM WHENCE HE FELL RESTOR'D
BY BOTH HIS WAYS I MEAN OR ONE ALONE
BUT SINCE THE DEED IS EVER PRIZ'D THE MORE
THE MORE THE DOER'S GOOD INTENT APPEARS
GOODNESS CELESTIAL WHOSE BROAD SIGNATURE
IS ON THE UNIVERSE OF ALL ITS WAYS
TO RAISE YE UP WAS FAIN TO LEAVE OUT NONE
NOR AUGHT SO VAST OR SO MAGNIFICENT
EITHER FOR HIM WHO GAVE OR WHO RECEIV'D
BETWEEN THE LAST NIGHT AND THE PRIMAL DAY
WAS OR CAN BE
FOR GOD MORE BOUNTY SHOW'D
GIVING HIMSELF TO MAKE MAN CAPABLE
OF HIS RETURN TO LIFE THAN HAD THE TERMS
BEEN MERE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE
AND FOR HIS JUSTICE EVERY METHOD ELSE
WERE ALL TOO SCANT HAD NOT THE SON OF GOD
HUMBLED HIMSELF TO PUT ON MORTAL FLESH
NOW TO FULFIL EACH WISH OF THINE REMAINS
I SOMEWHAT FURTHER TO THY VIEW UNFOLD
THAT THOU MAYST SEE AS CLEARLY AS MYSELF
I SEE THOU SAYST THE AIR THE FIRE I SEE
THE EARTH AND WATER AND ALL THINGS OF THEM
COMPOUNDED TO CORRUPTION TURN AND SOON
DISSOLVE
YET THESE WERE ALSO THINGS CREATE
BECAUSE IF WHAT WERE TOLD ME HAD BEEN TRUE
THEY FROM CORRUPTION HAD BEEN THEREFORE FREE
THE ANGELS O MY BROTHER AND THIS CLIME
WHEREIN THOU ART IMPASSIBLE AND PURE
I CALL CREATED AS INDEED THEY ARE
IN THEIR WHOLE BEING
BUT THE ELEMENTS
WHICH THOU HAST NAM'D AND WHAT OF THEM IS MADE
ARE BY CREATED VIRTUE' INFORM'D CREATE
THEIR SUBSTANCE AND CREATE THE' INFORMING VIRTUE
IN THESE BRIGHT STARS THAT ROUND THEM CIRCLING MOVE
THE SOUL OF EVERY BRUTE AND OF EACH PLANT
THE RAY AND MOTION OF THE SACRED LIGHTS
WITH COMPLEX POTENCY ATTRACT AND TURN
BUT THIS OUR LIFE THE' ETERNAL GOOD INSPIRES
IMMEDIATE AND ENAMOURS OF ITSELF
SO THAT OUR WISHES REST FOR EVER HERE
AND HENCE THOU MAYST BY INFERENCE CONCLUDE
OUR RESURRECTION CERTAIN IF THY MIND
CONSIDER HOW THE HUMAN FLESH WAS FRAM'D
WHEN BOTH OUR PARENTS AT THE FIRST WERE MADE
CANTO VIII
THE WORLD WAS IN ITS DAY OF PERIL DARK
WONT TO BELIEVE THE DOTAGE OF FOND LOVE
FROM THE FAIR CYPRIAN DEITY WHO ROLLS
IN HER THIRD EPICYCLE SHED ON MEN
BY STREAM OF POTENT RADIANCE THEREFORE THEY
OF ELDER TIME IN THEIR OLD ERROR BLIND
NOT HER ALONE WITH SACRIFICE ADOR'D
AND INVOCATION BUT LIKE HONOURS PAID
TO CUPID AND DIONE DEEM'D OF THEM
HER MOTHER AND HER SON HIM WHOM THEY FEIGN'D
TO SIT IN DIDO'S BOSOM AND FROM HER
WHOM I HAVE SUNG PRELUDING BORROW'D THEY
THE APPELLATION OF THAT STAR WHICH VIEWS
NOW OBVIOUS AND NOW AVERSE THE SUN
I WAS NOT WARE THAT I WAS WAFTED UP
INTO ITS ORB BUT THE NEW LOVELINESS
THAT GRAC'D MY LADY GAVE ME AMPLE PROOF
THAT WE HAD ENTERED THERE
AND AS IN FLAME
A SPARKLE IS DISTINCT OR VOICE IN VOICE
DISCERN'D WHEN ONE ITS EVEN TENOUR KEEPS
THE OTHER COMES AND GOES SO IN THAT LIGHT
I OTHER LUMINARIES SAW THAT COURS'D
IN CIRCLING MOTION RAPID MORE OR LESS
AS THEIR ETERNAL PHASES EACH IMPELS
NEVER WAS BLAST FROM VAPOUR CHARGED WITH COLD
WHETHER INVISIBLE TO EYE OR NO
DESCENDED WITH SUCH SPEED IT HAD NOT SEEM'D
TO LINGER IN DULL TARDINESS COMPAR'D
TO THOSE CELESTIAL LIGHTS THAT TOW'RDS US CAME
LEAVING THE CIRCUIT OF THEIR JOYOUS RING
CONDUCTED BY THE LOFTY SERAPHIM
AND AFTER THEM WHO IN THE VAN APPEAR'D
SUCH AN HOSANNA SOUNDED AS HATH LEFT
DESIRE NE'ER SINCE EXTINCT IN ME TO HEAR
RENEW'D THE STRAIN
THEN PARTING FROM THE REST
ONE NEAR US DREW AND SOLE BEGAN WE ALL
ARE READY AT THY PLEASURE WELL DISPOS'D
TO DO THEE GENTLE SERVICE
WE ARE THEY
TO WHOM THOU IN THE WORLD EREWHILE DIDST SING
'O YE WHOSE INTELLECTUAL MINISTRY
MOVES THE THIRD HEAVEN AND IN ONE ORB WE ROLL
ONE MOTION ONE IMPULSE WITH THOSE WHO RULE
PRINCEDOMS IN HEAVEN YET ARE OF LOVE SO FULL
THAT TO PLEASE THEE 'T WILL BE AS SWEET TO REST
AFTER MINE EYES HAD WITH MEEK REVERENCE
SOUGHT THE CELESTIAL GUIDE AND WERE BY HER
ASSUR'D THEY TURN'D AGAIN UNTO THE LIGHT
WHO HAD SO LARGELY PROMIS'D AND WITH VOICE
THAT BARE THE LIVELY PRESSURE OF MY ZEAL
TELL WHO YE ARE I CRIED
FORTHWITH IT GREW
IN SIZE AND SPLENDOUR THROUGH AUGMENTED JOY
AND THUS IT ANSWER'D A SHORT DATE BELOW
THE WORLD POSSESS'D ME
HAD THE TIME BEEN MORE
MUCH EVIL THAT WILL COME HAD NEVER CHANC'D
MY GLADNESS HIDES THEE FROM ME WHICH DOTH SHINE
AROUND AND SHROUD ME AS AN ANIMAL
IN ITS OWN SILK UNSWATH'D
THOU LOV'DST ME WELL
AND HAD'ST GOOD CAUSE FOR HAD MY SOJOURNING
BEEN LONGER ON THE EARTH THE LOVE I BARE THEE
HAD PUT FORTH MORE THAN BLOSSOMS
THE LEFT BANK
THAT RHONE WHEN HE HATH MIX'D WITH SORGA LAVES
IN ME ITS LORD EXPECTED AND THAT HORN
OF FAIR AUSONIA WITH ITS BOROUGHS OLD
BARI AND CROTON AND GAETA PIL'D
FROM WHERE THE TRENTO DISEMBOGUES HIS WAVES
WITH VERDE MINGLED TO THE SALT SEA FLOOD
ALREADY ON MY TEMPLES BEAM'D THE CROWN
WHICH GAVE ME SOV'REIGNTY OVER THE LAND
BY DANUBE WASH'D WHENAS HE STRAYS BEYOND
THE LIMITS OF HIS GERMAN SHORES
THE REALM
WHERE ON THE GULF BY STORMY EURUS LASH'D
BETWIXT PELORUS AND PACHYNIAN HEIGHTS
THE BEAUTIFUL TRINACRIA LIES IN GLOOM
NOT THROUGH TYPHAEUS BUT THE VAP'RY CLOUD
BITUMINOUS UPSTEAM'D THAT TOO DID LOOK
TO HAVE ITS SCEPTER WIELDED BY A RACE
OF MONARCHS SPRUNG THROUGH ME FROM CHARLES AND RODOLPH
HAD NOT ILL LORDING WHICH DOTH SPIRIT UP
THE PEOPLE EVER IN PALERMO RAIS'D
THE SHOUT OF 'DEATH RE ECHO'D LOUD AND LONG
HAD BUT MY BROTHER'S FORESIGHT KENN'D AS MUCH
HE HAD BEEN WARIER THAT THE GREEDY WANT
OF CATALONIA MIGHT NOT WORK HIS BALE
AND TRULY NEED THERE IS THAT HE FORECAST
OR OTHER FOR HIM LEST MORE FREIGHT BE LAID
ON HIS ALREADY OVER LADEN BARK
NATURE IN HIM FROM BOUNTY FALL'N TO THRIFT
WOULD ASK THE GUARD OF BRAVER ARMS THAN SUCH
AS ONLY CARE TO HAVE THEIR COFFERS FILL'D
MY LIEGE IT DOTH ENHANCE THE JOY THY WORDS
INFUSE INTO ME MIGHTY AS IT IS
TO THINK MY GLADNESS MANIFEST TO THEE
AS TO MYSELF WHO OWN IT WHEN THOU LOOKST
INTO THE SOURCE AND LIMIT OF ALL GOOD
THERE WHERE THOU MARKEST THAT WHICH THOU DOST SPEAK
THENCE PRIZ'D OF ME THE MORE
GLAD THOU HAST MADE ME
NOW MAKE INTELLIGENT CLEARING THE DOUBT
THY SPEECH HATH RAISED IN ME FOR MUCH I MUSE
HOW BITTER CAN SPRING UP WHEN SWEET IS SOWN
I THUS INQUIRING HE FORTHWITH REPLIED
IF I HAVE POWER TO SHOW ONE TRUTH SOON THAT
SHALL FACE THEE WHICH THY QUESTIONING DECLARES
BEHIND THEE NOW CONCEAL'D
THE GOOD THAT GUIDES
AND BLESSED MAKES THIS REALM WHICH THOU DOST MOUNT
ORDAINS ITS PROVIDENCE TO BE THE VIRTUE
IN THESE GREAT BODIES NOR TH' ALL PERFECT MIND
UPHOLDS THEIR NATURE MERELY BUT IN THEM
THEIR ENERGY TO SAVE FOR NOUGHT THAT LIES
WITHIN THE RANGE OF THAT UNERRING BOW
BUT IS AS LEVEL WITH THE DESTIN'D AIM
AS EVER MARK TO ARROW'S POINT OPPOS'D
WERE IT NOT THUS THESE HEAVENS THOU DOST VISIT
WOULD THEIR EFFECT SO WORK IT WOULD NOT BE
ART BUT DESTRUCTION AND THIS MAY NOT CHANCE
IF TH' INTELLECTUAL POWERS THAT MOVE THESE STARS
FAIL NOT OR WHO FIRST FAULTY MADE THEM FAIL
WILT THOU THIS TRUTH MORE CLEARLY EVIDENC'D
TO WHOM I THUS IT IS ENOUGH NO FEAR
I SEE LEST NATURE IN HER PART SHOULD TIRE
HE STRAIGHT REJOIN'D SAY WERE IT WORSE FOR MAN
IF HE LIV'D NOT IN FELLOWSHIP ON EARTH
YEA ANSWER'D I NOR HERE A REASON NEEDS
AND MAY THAT BE IF DIFFERENT ESTATES
GROW NOT OF DIFFERENT DUTIES IN YOUR LIFE
CONSULT YOUR TEACHER AND HE TELLS YOU 'NO
THUS DID HE COME DEDUCING TO THIS POINT
AND THEN CONCLUDED FOR THIS CAUSE BEHOOVES
THE ROOTS FROM WHENCE YOUR OPERATIONS COME
MUST DIFFER
THEREFORE ONE IS SOLON BORN
ANOTHER XERXES AND MELCHISIDEC
A THIRD AND HE A FOURTH WHOSE AIRY VOYAGE
COST HIM HIS SON
IN HER CIRCUITOUS COURSE
NATURE THAT IS THE SEAL TO MORTAL WAX
DOTH WELL HER ART BUT NO DISTINCTIONS OWNS
'TWIXT ONE OR OTHER HOUSEHOLD
HENCE BEFALLS
THAT ESAU IS SO WIDE OF JACOB HENCE
QUIRINUS OF SO BASE A FATHER SPRINGS
HE DATES FROM MARS HIS LINEAGE
WERE IT NOT
THAT PROVIDENCE CELESTIAL OVERRUL'D
NATURE IN GENERATION MUST THE PATH
TRAC'D BY THE GENERATOR STILL PURSUE
UNSWERVINGLY
THUS PLACE I IN THY SIGHT
THAT WHICH WAS LATE BEHIND THEE
BUT IN SIGN
OF MORE AFFECTION FOR THEE 'T IS MY WILL
THOU WEAR THIS COROLLARY
NATURE EVER
FINDING DISCORDANT FORTUNE LIKE ALL SEED
OUT OF ITS PROPER CLIMATE THRIVES BUT ILL
AND WERE THE WORLD BELOW CONTENT TO MARK
AND WORK ON THE FOUNDATION NATURE LAYS
IT WOULD NOT LACK SUPPLY OF EXCELLENCE
BUT YE PERVERSELY TO RELIGION STRAIN
HIM WHO WAS BORN TO GIRD ON HIM THE SWORD
AND OF THE FLUENT PHRASEMEN MAKE YOUR KING
THEREFORE YOUR STEPS HAVE WANDER'D FROM THE PATHS
CANTO IX
AFTER SOLUTION OF MY DOUBT THY CHARLES
O FAIR CLEMENZA OF THE TREACHERY SPAKE
THAT MUST BEFALL HIS SEED BUT TELL IT NOT
SAID HE AND LET THE DESTIN'D YEARS COME ROUND
NOR MAY I TELL THEE MORE SAVE THAT THE MEED
OF SORROW WELL DESERV'D SHALL QUIT YOUR WRONGS
AND NOW THE VISAGE OF THAT SAINTLY LIGHT
WAS TO THE SUN THAT FILLS IT TURN'D AGAIN
AS TO THE GOOD WHOSE PLENITUDE OF BLISS
SUFFICETH ALL
O YE MISGUIDED SOULS
INFATUATE WHO FROM SUCH A GOOD ESTRANGE
YOUR HEARTS AND BEND YOUR GAZE ON VANITY
ALAS FOR YOU AND LO TOWARD ME NEXT
ANOTHER OF THOSE SPLENDENT FORMS APPROACH'D
THAT BY ITS OUTWARD BRIGHT'NING TESTIFIED
THE WILL IT HAD TO PLEASURE ME
THE EYES
OF BEATRICE RESTING AS BEFORE
FIRMLY UPON ME MANIFESTED FORTH
APPROVAL OF MY WISH
AND O I CRIED
BLEST SPIRIT QUICKLY BE MY WILL PERFORM'D
AND PROVE THOU TO ME THAT MY INMOST THOUGHTS
I CAN REFLECT ON THEE THEREAT THE LIGHT
THAT YET WAS NEW TO ME FROM THE RECESS
WHERE IT BEFORE WAS SINGING THUS BEGAN
AS ONE WHO JOYS IN KINDNESS IN THAT PART
OF THE DEPRAV'D ITALIAN LAND WHICH LIES
BETWEEN RIALTO AND THE FOUNTAIN SPRINGS
OF BRENTA AND OF PIAVA THERE DOTH RISE
BUT TO NO LOFTY EMINENCE A HILL
FROM WHENCE EREWHILE A FIREBRAND DID DESCEND
THAT SORELY SHEET THE REGION
FROM ONE ROOT
I AND IT SPRANG MY NAME ON EARTH CUNIZZA
AND HERE I GLITTER FOR THAT BY ITS LIGHT
THIS STAR O'ERCAME ME
YET I NAUGHT REPINE
NOR GRUDGE MYSELF THE CAUSE OF THIS MY LOT
WHICH HAPLY VULGAR HEARTS CAN SCARCE CONCEIVE
THIS JEWEL THAT IS NEXT ME IN OUR HEAVEN
LUSTROUS AND COSTLY GREAT RENOWN HATH LEFT
AND NOT TO PERISH ERE THESE HUNDRED YEARS
FIVE TIMES ABSOLVE THEIR ROUND
CONSIDER THOU
IF TO EXCEL BE WORTHY MAN'S ENDEAVOUR
WHEN SUCH LIFE MAY ATTEND THE FIRST
YET THEY
CARE NOT FOR THIS THE CROWD THAT NOW ARE GIRT
BY ADICE AND TAGLIAMENTO STILL
IMPENITENT THO' SCOURG'D
THE HOUR IS NEAR
WHEN FOR THEIR STUBBORNNESS AT PADUA'S MARSH
THE WATER SHALL BE CHANG'D THAT LAVES VICENA
AND WHERE CAGNANO MEETS WITH SILE ONE
LORDS IT AND BEARS HIS HEAD ALOFT FOR WHOM
THE WEB IS NOW A WARPING
FELTRO TOO
SHALL SORROW FOR ITS GODLESS SHEPHERD'S FAULT
OF SO DEEP STAIN THAT NEVER FOR THE LIKE
WAS MALTA'S BAR UNCLOS'D
TOO LARGE SHOULD BE
THE SKILLET THAT WOULD HOLD FERRARA'S BLOOD
AND WEARIED HE WHO OUNCE BY OUNCE WOULD WEIGHT IT
THE WHICH THIS PRIEST IN SHOW OF PARTY ZEAL
COURTEOUS WILL GIVE NOR WILL THE GIFT ILL SUIT
THE COUNTRY'S CUSTOM
WE DESCRY ABOVE
MIRRORS YE CALL THEM THRONES FROM WHICH TO US
REFLECTED SHINE THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR GOD
WHENCE THESE OUR SAYINGS WE AVOUCH FOR GOOD
SHE ENDED AND APPEAR'D ON OTHER THOUGHTS
INTENT RE ENT'RING ON THE WHEEL SHE LATE
HAD LEFT
THAT OTHER JOYANCE MEANWHILE WAX'D
A THING TO MARVEL AT IN SPLENDOUR GLOWING
LIKE CHOICEST RUBY STRICKEN BY THE SUN
FOR IN THAT UPPER CLIME EFFULGENCE COMES
OF GLADNESS AS HERE LAUGHTER AND BELOW
AS THE MIND SADDENS MURKIER GROWS THE SHADE
GOD SEETH ALL AND IN HIM IS THY SIGHT
SAID I BLEST SPIRIT THEREFORE WILL OF HIS
CANNOT TO THEE BE DARK
WHY THEN DELAYS
THY VOICE TO SATISFY MY WISH UNTOLD
THAT VOICE WHICH JOINS THE INEXPRESSIVE SONG
PASTIME OF HEAV'N THE WHICH THOSE ARDOURS SING
THAT COWL THEM WITH SIX SHADOWING WINGS OUTSPREAD
I WOULD NOT WAIT THY ASKING WERT THOU KNOWN
TO ME AS THOROUGHLY I TO THEE AM KNOWN
HE FORTHWITH ANSW'RING THUS HIS WORDS BEGAN
THE VALLEY' OF WATERS WIDEST NEXT TO THAT
WHICH DOTH THE EARTH ENGARLAND SHAPES ITS COURSE
BETWEEN DISCORDANT SHORES AGAINST THE SUN
INWARD SO FAR IT MAKES MERIDIAN THERE
WHERE WAS BEFORE TH' HORIZON
OF THAT VALE
DWELT I UPON THE SHORE 'TWIXT EBRO'S STREAM
AND MACRA'S THAT DIVIDES WITH PASSAGE BRIEF
GENOAN BOUNDS FROM TUSCAN
EAST AND WEST
ARE NEARLY ONE TO BEGGA AND MY LAND
WHOSE HAVEN ERST WAS WITH ITS OWN BLOOD WARM
WHO KNEW MY NAME WERE WONT TO CALL ME FOLCO
AND I DID BEAR IMPRESSION OF THIS HEAV'N
THAT NOW BEARS MINE FOR NOT WITH FIERCER FLAME
GLOW'D BELUS' DAUGHTER INJURING ALIKE
SICHAEUS AND CREUSA THAN DID I
LONG AS IT SUITED THE UNRIPEN'D DOWN
THAT FLEDG'D MY CHEEK NOR SHE OF RHODOPE
THAT WAS BEGUILED OF DEMOPHOON
NOR JOVE'S SON WHEN THE CHARMS OF IOLE
WERE SHRIN'D WITHIN HIS HEART
AND YET THERE HIDES
NO SORROWFUL REPENTANCE HERE BUT MIRTH
NOT FOR THE FAULT THAT DOTH NOT COME TO MIND
BUT FOR THE VIRTUE WHOSE O'ERRULING SWAY
AND PROVIDENCE HAVE WROUGHT THUS QUAINTLY
HERE
THE SKILL IS LOOK'D INTO THAT FASHIONETH
WITH SUCH EFFECTUAL WORKING AND THE GOOD
DISCERN'D ACCRUING TO THIS UPPER WORLD
FROM THAT BELOW
BUT FULLY TO CONTENT
THY WISHES ALL THAT IN THIS SPHERE HAVE BIRTH
DEMANDS MY FURTHER PARLE
INQUIRE THOU WOULDST
WHO OF THIS LIGHT IS DENIZEN THAT HERE
BESIDE ME SPARKLES AS THE SUN BEAM DOTH
ON THE CLEAR WAVE
KNOW THEN THE SOUL OF RAHAB
IS IN THAT GLADSOME HARBOUR TO OUR TRIBE
UNITED AND THE FOREMOST RANK ASSIGN'D
HE TO THAT HEAV'N AT WHICH THE SHADOW ENDS
OF YOUR SUBLUNAR WORLD WAS TAKEN UP
FIRST IN CHRIST'S TRIUMPH OF ALL SOULS REDEEM'D
FOR WELL BEHOOV'D THAT IN SOME PART OF HEAV'N
SHE SHOULD REMAIN A TROPHY TO DECLARE
THE MIGHTY CONTEST WON WITH EITHER PALM
FOR THAT SHE FAVOUR'D FIRST THE HIGH EXPLOIT
OF JOSHUA ON THE HOLY LAND WHEREOF
THE POPE RECKS LITTLE NOW
THY CITY PLANT
OF HIM THAT ON HIS MAKER TURN'D THE BACK
AND OF WHOSE ENVYING SO MUCH WOE HATH SPRUNG
ENGENDERS AND EXPANDS THE CURSED FLOWER
THAT HATH MADE WANDER BOTH THE SHEEP AND LAMBS
TURNING THE SHEPHERD TO A WOLF
FOR THIS
THE GOSPEL AND GREAT TEACHERS LAID ASIDE
THE DECRETALS AS THEIR STUFT MARGINS SHOW
ARE THE SOLE STUDY
POPE AND CARDINALS
INTENT ON THESE NE'ER JOURNEY BUT IN THOUGHT
TO NAZARETH WHERE GABRIEL OP'D HIS WINGS
YET IT MAY CHANCE ERELONG THE VATICAN
AND OTHER MOST SELECTED PARTS OF ROME
THAT WERE THE GRAVE OF PETER'S SOLDIERY
SHALL BE DELIVER'D FROM THE ADULT'ROUS BOND
CANTO X

O READER TO THE LOFTY WHEELS WITH ME
THY KEN DIRECTED TO THE POINT WHEREAT

THY WONDER OF THE MIGHTY ARCHITECT
WHO LOVES HIS WORK SO INWARDLY HIS EYE

SEE HOW THENCE OBLIQUE
BRANCHETH THE CIRCLE WHERE THE PLANETS ROLL
TO POUR THEIR WISHED INFLUENCE ON THE WORLD
WHOSE PATH NOT BENDING THUS IN HEAV'N ABOVE
MUCH VIRTUE WOULD BE LOST AND HERE ON EARTH
ALL POWER WELL NIGH EXTINCT OR FROM DIRECT

I' TH' UNIVERSAL ORDER GREAT DEFECT

NOW REST THEE READER ON THY BENCH AND MUSE
ANTICIPATIVE OF THE FEAST TO COME
SO SHALL DELIGHT MAKE THEE NOT FEEL THY TOIL
LO I HAVE SET BEFORE THEE FOR THYSELF
FEED NOW THE MATTER I INDITE HENCEFORTH
DEMANDS ENTIRE MY THOUGHT
JOIN'D WITH THE PART
WHICH LATE WE TOLD OF THE GREAT MINISTER
OF NATURE THAT UPON THE WORLD IMPRINTS
THE VIRTUE OF THE HEAVEN AND DOLES OUT
TIME FOR US WITH HIS BEAM WENT CIRCLING ON
ALONG THE SPIRES WHERE EACH HOUR SOONER COMES
AND I WAS WITH HIM WEETLESS OF ASCENT
AS ONE WHO TILL ARRIV'D WEETS NOT HIS COMING
FOR BEATRICE SHE WHO PASSETH ON
SO SUDDENLY FROM GOOD TO BETTER TIME
COUNTS NOT THE ACT OH THEN HOW GREAT MUST NEEDS
HAVE BEEN HER BRIGHTNESS WHAT SHE WAS I' TH' SUN
WHERE I HAD ENTER'D NOT THROUGH CHANGE OF HUE
BUT LIGHT TRANSPARENT DID I SUMMON UP
GENIUS ART PRACTICE I MIGHT NOT SO SPEAK
IT SHOULD BE E'ER IMAGIN'D YET BELIEV'D
IT MAY BE AND THE SIGHT BE JUSTLY CRAV'D
AND IF OUR FANTASY FAIL OF SUCH HEIGHT
WHAT MARVEL SINCE NO EYE ABOVE THE SUN
HATH EVER TRAVEL'D SUCH ARE THEY DWELL HERE
FOURTH FAMILY OF THE OMNIPOTENT SIRE
WHO OF HIS SPIRIT AND OF HIS OFFSPRING SHOWS
AND HOLDS THEM STILL ENRAPTUR'D WITH THE VIEW
AND THUS TO ME BEATRICE THANK OH THANK
THE SUN OF ANGELS HIM WHO BY HIS GRACE
TO THIS PERCEPTIBLE HATH LIFTED THEE
NEVER WAS HEART IN SUCH DEVOTION BOUND
AND WITH COMPLACENCY SO ABSOLUTE
DISPOS'D TO RENDER UP ITSELF TO GOD
AS MINE WAS AT THOSE WORDS AND SO ENTIRE
THE LOVE FOR HIM THAT HELD ME IT ECLIPS'D
BEATRICE IN OBLIVION
NAUGHT DISPLEAS'D
WAS SHE BUT SMIL'D THEREAT SO JOYOUSLY
THAT OF HER LAUGHING EYES THE RADIANCE BRAKE
AND SCATTER'D MY COLLECTED MIND ABROAD
THEN SAW I A BRIGHT BAND IN LIVELINESS
SURPASSING WHO THEMSELVES DID MAKE THE CROWN
AND US THEIR CENTRE YET MORE SWEET IN VOICE
THAN IN THEIR VISAGE BEAMING
CINCTUR'D THUS
SOMETIME LATONA'S DAUGHTER WE BEHOLD
WHEN THE IMPREGNATE AIR RETAINS THE THREAD
THAT WEAVES HER ZONE
IN THE CELESTIAL COURT
WHENCE I RETURN ARE MANY JEWELS FOUND
SO DEAR AND BEAUTIFUL THEY CANNOT BROOK
TRANSPORTING FROM THAT REALM AND OF THESE LIGHTS
SUCH WAS THE SONG
WHO DOTH NOT PRUNE HIS WING
TO SOAR UP THITHER LET HIM LOOK FROM THENCE
FOR TIDINGS FROM THE DUMB
WHEN SINGING THUS
THOSE BURNING SUNS THAT CIRCLED ROUND US THRICE
AS NEAREST STARS AROUND THE FIXED POLE
THEN SEEM'D THEY LIKE TO LADIES FROM THE DANCE
NOT CEASING BUT SUSPENSE IN SILENT PAUSE
LIST'NING TILL THEY HAVE CAUGHT THE STRAIN ANEW
SUSPENDED SO THEY STOOD AND FROM WITHIN
THUS HEARD I ONE WHO SPAKE SINCE WITH ITS BEAM
THE GRACE WHENCE TRUE LOVE LIGHTETH FIRST HIS FLAME
THAT AFTER DOTH INCREASE BY LOVING SHINES
SO MULTIPLIED IN THEE IT LEADS THEE UP
ALONG THIS LADDER DOWN WHOSE HALLOW'D STEPS
NONE E'ER DESCEND AND MOUNT THEM NOT AGAIN
WHO FROM HIS PHIAL SHOULD REFUSE THEE WINE
TO SLAKE THY THIRST NO LESS CONSTRAINED WERE
THAN WATER FLOWING NOT UNTO THE SEA
THOU FAIN WOULDST HEAR WHAT PLANTS ARE THESE THAT BLOOM
IN THE BRIGHT GARLAND WHICH ADMIRING GIRDS
THIS FAIR DAME ROUND WHO STRENGTHENS THEE FOR HEAV'N
I THEN WAS OF THE LAMBS THAT DOMINIC
LEADS FOR HIS SAINTLY FLOCK ALONG THE WAY
WHERE WELL THEY THRIVE NOT SWORN WITH VANITY
HE NEAREST ON MY RIGHT HAND BROTHER WAS
AND MASTER TO ME ALBERT OF COLOGNE
IS THIS AND OF AQUINUM THOMAS I
IF THOU OF ALL THE REST WOULDST BE ASSUR'D
LET THINE EYE WAITING ON THE WORDS I SPEAK
IN CIRCUIT JOURNEY ROUND THE BLESSED WREATH
THAT NEXT RESPLENDENCE ISSUES FROM THE SMILE
OF GRATIAN WHO TO EITHER FORUM LENT
SUCH HELP AS FAVOUR WINS IN PARADISE
THE OTHER NEAREST WHO ADORNS OUR QUIRE
WAS PETER HE THAT WITH THE WIDOW GAVE
TO HOLY CHURCH HIS TREASURE
THE FIFTH LIGHT
GOODLIEST OF ALL IS BY SUCH LOVE INSPIRED
THAT ALL YOUR WORLD CRAVES TIDINGS OF ITS DOOM
WITHIN THERE IS THE LOFTY LIGHT ENDOW'D
WITH SAPIENCE SO PROFOUND IF TRUTH BE TRUTH
THAT WITH A KEN OF SUCH WIDE AMPLITUDE
NO SECOND HATH ARISEN
NEXT BEHOLD
THAT TAPER'S RADIANCE TO WHOSE VIEW WAS SHOWN
CLEARLIEST THE NATURE AND THE MINISTRY
ANGELICAL WHILE YET IN FLESH IT DWELT
IN THE OTHER LITTLE LIGHT SERENELY SMILES
THAT PLEADER FOR THE CHRISTIAN TEMPLES HE
WHO DID PROVIDE AUGUSTIN OF HIS LORE
NOW IF THY MIND'S EYE PASS FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT
UPON MY PRAISES FOLLOWING OF THE EIGHTH
THY THIRST IS NEXT
THE SAINTLY SOUL THAT SHOWS
THE WORLD'S DECEITFULNESS TO ALL WHO HEAR HIM
IS WITH THE SIGHT OF ALL THE GOOD THAT IS
BLEST THERE
THE LIMBS WHENCE IT WAS DRIVEN LIE
DOWN IN CIELDAURO AND FROM MARTYRDOM
AND EXILE CAME IT HERE
LO FURTHER ON
WHERE FLAMES THE ARDUOUS SPIRIT OF ISIDORE
OF BEDE AND RICHARD MORE THAN MAN EREWHILE
IN DEEP DISCERNMENT
LASTLY THIS FROM WHOM
THY LOOK ON ME REVERTETH WAS THE BEAM
OF ONE WHOSE SPIRIT ON HIGH MUSINGS BENT
REBUK'D THE LING'RING TARDINESS OF DEATH
IT IS THE ETERNAL LIGHT OF SIGEBERT
WHO 'SCAP'D NOT ENVY WHEN OF TRUTH HE ARGUED
READING IN THE STRAW LITTER'D STREET FORTHWITH
AS CLOCK THAT CALLETH UP THE SPOUSE OF GOD
TO WIN HER BRIDEGROOM'S LOVE AT MATIN'S HOUR
EACH PART OF OTHER FITLY DRAWN AND URG'D
SENDS OUT A TINKLING SOUND OF NOTE SO SWEET
AFFECTION SPRINGS IN WELL DISPOSED BREAST
THUS SAW I MOVE THE GLORIOUS WHEEL THUS HEARD
VOICE ANSW'RING VOICE SO MUSICAL AND SOFT
IT CAN BE KNOWN BUT WHERE DAY ENDLESS SHINES
CANTO XI
O FOND ANXIETY OF MORTAL MEN
HOW VAIN AND INCONCLUSIVE ARGUMENTS
ARE THOSE WHICH MAKE THEE BEAT THY WINGS BELOW
FOR STATUES ONE AND ONE FOR APHORISMS
WAS HUNTING THIS THE PRIESTHOOD FOLLOW'D THAT
BY FORCE OR SOPHISTRY ASPIR'D TO RULE
TO ROB ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SOUGHT
BY CIVIL BUSINESS WEALTH ONE MOILING LAY
TANGLED IN NET OF SENSUAL DELIGHT
AND ONE TO WITLESS INDOLENCE RESIGN'D
WHAT TIME FROM ALL THESE EMPTY THINGS ESCAP'D
WITH BEATRICE I THUS GLORIOUSLY
WAS RAIS'D ALOFT AND MADE THE GUEST OF HEAV'N
THEY OF THE CIRCLE TO THAT POINT EACH ONE
WHERE ERST IT WAS HAD TURN'D AND STEADY GLOW'D
AS CANDLE IN HIS SOCKET
THEN WITHIN
THE LUSTRE THAT EREWHILE BESPAKE ME SMILING
WITH MERER GLADNESS HEARD I THUS BEGIN
E'EN AS HIS BEAM ILLUMES ME SO I LOOK
INTO THE ETERNAL LIGHT AND CLEARLY MARK
THY THOUGHTS FROM WHENCE THEY RISE
THOU ART IN DOUBT
AND WOULDST THAT I SHOULD BOLT MY WORDS AFRESH
IN SUCH PLAIN OPEN PHRASE AS MAY BE SMOOTH
TO THY PERCEPTION WHERE I TOLD THEE LATE
THAT 'WELL THEY THRIVE AND THAT 'NO SECOND SUCH
HATH RISEN WHICH NO SMALL DISTINCTION NEEDS
THE PROVIDENCE THAT GOVERNETH THE WORLD
IN DEPTH OF COUNSEL BY CREATED KEN
UNFATHOMABLE TO THE END THAT SHE
WHO WITH LOUD CRIES WAS 'SPOUS'D IN PRECIOUS BLOOD
MIGHT KEEP HER FOOTING TOWARDS HER WELL BELOV'D
SAFE IN HERSELF AND CONSTANT UNTO HIM
HATH TWO ORDAIN'D WHO SHOULD ON EITHER HAND
IN CHIEF ESCORT HER ONE SERAPHIC ALL
IN FERVENCY FOR WISDOM UPON EARTH
THE OTHER SPLENDOUR OF CHERUBIC LIGHT
I BUT OF ONE WILL TELL HE TELLS OF BOTH
WHO ONE COMMENDETH WHICH OF THEM SO'ER
BE TAKEN FOR THEIR DEEDS WERE TO ONE END
BETWEEN TUPINO AND THE WAVE THAT FALLS
FROM BLEST UBALDO'S CHOSEN HILL THERE HANGS
RICH SLOPE OF MOUNTAIN HIGH WHENCE HEAT AND COLD
ARE WAFTED THROUGH PERUGIA'S EASTERN GATE
AND NORCERA WITH GUALDO IN ITS REAR
MOURN FOR THEIR HEAVY YOKE
UPON THAT SIDE
WHERE IT DOTH BREAK ITS STEEPNESS MOST AROSE
A SUN UPON THE WORLD AS DULY THIS
FROM GANGES DOTH THEREFORE LET NONE WHO SPEAK
OF THAT PLACE SAY ASCESI FOR ITS NAME
WERE LAMELY SO DELIVER'D BUT THE EAST
TO CALL THINGS RIGHTLY BE IT HENCEFORTH STYL'D
HE WAS NOT YET MUCH DISTANT FROM HIS RISING
WHEN HIS GOOD INFLUENCE 'GAN TO BLESS THE EARTH
A DAME TO WHOM NONE OPENETH PLEASURE'S GATE
MORE THAN TO DEATH WAS 'GAINST HIS FATHER'S WILL
HIS STRIPLING CHOICE AND HE DID MAKE HER HIS
BEFORE THE SPIRITUAL COURT BY NUPTIAL BONDS
AND IN HIS FATHER'S SIGHT FROM DAY TO DAY
THEN LOV'D HER MORE DEVOUTLY
SHE BEREAV'D
OF HER FIRST HUSBAND SLIGHTED AND OBSCURE
THOUSAND AND HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE REMAIN'D
WITHOUT A SINGLE SUITOR TILL HE CAME
NOR AUGHT AVAIL'D THAT WITH AMYCLAS SHE
WAS FOUND UNMOV'D AT RUMOUR OF HIS VOICE
WHO SHOOK THE WORLD NOR AUGHT HER CONSTANT BOLDNESS
WHEREBY WITH CHRIST SHE MOUNTED ON THE CROSS
WHEN MARY STAY'D BENEATH
BUT NOT TO DEAL
THUS CLOSELY WITH THEE LONGER TAKE AT LARGE
THE ROVERS' TITLES POVERTY AND FRANCIS
THEIR CONCORD AND GLAD LOOKS WONDER AND LOVE
AND SWEET REGARD GAVE BIRTH TO HOLY THOUGHTS
SO MUCH THAT VENERABLE BERNARD FIRST
DID BARE HIS FEET AND IN PURSUIT OF PEACE
SO HEAVENLY RAN YET DEEM'D HIS FOOTING SLOW
O HIDDEN RICHES O PROLIFIC GOOD
EGIDIUS BARES HIM NEXT AND NEXT SYLVESTER
AND FOLLOW BOTH THE BRIDEGROOM SO THE BRIDE
CAN PLEASE THEM
THENCEFORTH GOES HE ON HIS WAY
THE FATHER AND THE MASTER WITH HIS SPOUSE
AND WITH THAT FAMILY WHOM NOW THE CORD
GIRT HUMBLY NOR DID ABJECTNESS OF HEART
WEIGH DOWN HIS EYELIDS FOR THAT HE WAS SON
OF PIETRO BERNARDONE AND BY MEN
IN WOND'ROUS SORT DESPIS'D
BUT ROYALLY
HIS HARD INTENTION HE TO INNOCENT
SET FORTH AND FROM HIM FIRST RECEIV'D THE SEAL
ON HIS RELIGION
THEN WHEN NUMEROUS FLOCK'D
THE TRIBE OF LOWLY ONES THAT TRAC'D HIS STEPS
WHOSE MARVELLOUS LIFE DESERVEDLY WERE SUNG
IN HEIGHTS EMPYREAL THROUGH HONORIUS' HAND
A SECOND CROWN TO DECK THEIR GUARDIAN'S VIRTUES
WAS BY THE ETERNAL SPIRIT INWREATH'D AND WHEN
HE HAD THROUGH THIRST OF MARTYRDOM STOOD UP
IN THE PROUD SOLDAN'S PRESENCE AND THERE PREACH'D
CHRIST AND HIS FOLLOWERS BUT FOUND THE RACE
UNRIPEN'D FOR CONVERSION BACK ONCE MORE
HE HASTED NOT TO INTERMIT HIS TOIL
AND REAP'D AUSONIAN LANDS
ON THE HARD ROCK
'TWIXT ARNO AND THE TYBER HE FROM CHRIST
TOOK THE LAST SIGNET WHICH HIS LIMBS TWO YEARS
DID CARRY
THEN THE SEASON COME THAT HE
WHO TO SUCH GOOD HAD DESTIN'D HIM WAS PLEAS'D
T' ADVANCE HIM TO THE MEED WHICH HE HAD EARN'D
BY HIS SELF HUMBLING TO HIS BROTHERHOOD
AS THEIR JUST HERITAGE HE GAVE IN CHARGE
HIS DEAREST LADY AND ENJOIN'D THEIR LOVE
AND FAITH TO HER AND FROM HER BOSOM WILL'D
HIS GOODLY SPIRIT SHOULD MOVE FORTH RETURNING
TO ITS APPOINTED KINGDOM NOR WOULD HAVE
HIS BODY LAID UPON ANOTHER BIER
THINK NOW OF ONE WHO WERE A FIT COLLEAGUE
TO KEEP THE BARK OF PETER IN DEEP SEA
HELM'D TO RIGHT POINT AND SUCH OUR PATRIARCH WAS
THEREFORE WHO FOLLOW HIM AS HE ENJOINS
THOU MAYST BE CERTAIN TAKE GOOD LADING IN
BUT HUNGER OF NEW VIANDS TEMPTS HIS FLOCK
SO THAT THEY NEEDS INTO STRANGE PASTURES WIDE
MUST SPREAD THEM AND THE MORE REMOTE FROM HIM
THE STRAGGLERS WANDER SO MUCH MOLE THEY COME
HOME TO THE SHEEP FOLD DESTITUTE OF MILK
THERE ARE OF THEM IN TRUTH WHO FEAR THEIR HARM
AND TO THE SHEPHERD CLEAVE BUT THESE SO FEW
A LITTLE STUFF MAY FURNISH OUT THEIR CLOAKS
NOW IF MY WORDS BE CLEAR IF THOU HAVE TA'EN
GOOD HEED IF THAT WHICH I HAVE TOLD RECALL
TO MIND THY WISH MAY BE IN PART FULFILL'D
FOR THOU WILT SEE THE POINT FROM WHENCE THEY SPLIT
NOR MISS OF THE REPROOF WHICH THAT IMPLIES
'THAT WELL THEY THRIVE NOT SWORN WITH VANITY
CANTO XII
SOON AS ITS FINAL WORD THE BLESSED FLAME
HAD RAIS'D FOR UTTERANCE STRAIGHT THE HOLY MILL
BEGAN TO WHEEL NOR YET HAD ONCE REVOLV'D
OR ERE ANOTHER CIRCLING COMPASS'D IT
MOTION TO MOTION SONG TO SONG CONJOINING
SONG THAT AS MUCH OUR MUSES DOTH EXCEL
OUR SIRENS WITH THEIR TUNEFUL PIPES AS RAY
OF PRIMAL SPLENDOUR DOTH ITS FAINT REFLEX
AS WHEN IF JUNO BID HER HANDMAID FORTH
TWO ARCHES PARALLEL AND TRICK'D ALIKE
SPAN THE THIN CLOUD THE OUTER TAKING BIRTH
FROM THAT WITHIN IN MANNER OF THAT VOICE
WHOM LOVE DID MELT AWAY AS SUN THE MIST
AND THEY WHO GAZE PRESAGEFUL CALL TO MIND
THE COMPACT MADE WITH NOAH OF THE WORLD
NO MORE TO BE O'ERFLOW'D ABOUT US THUS
OF SEMPITERNAL ROSES BENDING WREATH'D
THOSE GARLANDS TWAIN AND TO THE INNERMOST
E'EN THUS TH' EXTERNAL ANSWERED
WHEN THE FOOTING
AND OTHER GREAT FESTIVITY OF SONG
AND RADIANCE LIGHT WITH LIGHT ACCORDANT EACH
JOCUND AND BLYTHE HAD AT THEIR PLEASURE STILL'D
E'EN AS THE EYES BY QUICK VOLITION MOV'D
ARE SHUT AND RAIS'D TOGETHER FROM THE HEART
OF ONE AMONGST THE NEW LIGHTS MOV'D A VOICE
THAT MADE ME SEEM LIKE NEEDLE TO THE STAR
IN TURNING TO ITS WHEREABOUT AND THUS
BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME BEAUTIFUL
PROMPTS ME TO TELL OF TH' OTHER GUIDE FOR WHOM
SUCH GOOD OF MINE IS SPOKEN
WHERE ONE IS
THE OTHER WORTHILY SHOULD ALSO BE
THAT AS THEIR WARFARE WAS ALIKE ALIKE
SHOULD BE THEIR GLORY
SLOW AND FULL OF DOUBT
AND WITH THIN RANKS AFTER ITS BANNER MOV'D
THE ARMY OF CHRIST WHICH IT SO CLEARLY COST
TO REAPPOINT WHEN ITS IMPERIAL HEAD
WHO REIGNETH EVER FOR THE DROOPING HOST
DID MAKE PROVISION THOROUGH GRACE ALONE
AND NOT THROUGH ITS DESERVING
AS THOU HEARD'ST
TWO CHAMPIONS TO THE SUCCOUR OF HIS SPOUSE
HE SENT WHO BY THEIR DEEDS AND WORDS MIGHT JOIN
AGAIN HIS SCATTER'D PEOPLE
IN THAT CLIME
WHERE SPRINGS THE PLEASANT WEST WIND TO UNFOLD
THE FRESH LEAVES WITH WHICH EUROPE SEES HERSELF
NEW GARMENTED NOR FROM THOSE BILLOWS FAR
BEYOND WHOSE CHIDING AFTER WEARY COURSE
THE SUN DOTH SOMETIMES HIDE HIM SAFE ABIDES
THE HAPPY CALLAROGA UNDER GUARD
OF THE GREAT SHIELD WHEREIN THE LION LIES
SUBJECTED AND SUPREME
AND THERE WAS BORN
THE LOVING MILLION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH
THE HOLLOW'D WRESTLER GENTLE TO HIS OWN
AND TO HIS ENEMIES TERRIBLE
SO REPLETE
HIS SOUL WITH LIVELY VIRTUE THAT WHEN FIRST
CREATED EVEN IN THE MOTHER'S WOMB
IT PROPHESIED
WHEN AT THE SACRED FONT
THE SPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE 'TWIXT FAITH AND HIM
WHERE PLEDGE OF MUTUAL SAFETY WAS EXCHANG'D
THE DAME WHO WAS HIS SURETY IN HER SLEEP
BEHELD THE WONDROUS FRUIT THAT WAS FROM HIM
AND FROM HIS HEIRS TO ISSUE
AND THAT SUCH
HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS INDEED HE WAS
SHE WAS INSPIR'D TO NAME HIM OF HIS OWNER
WHOSE HE WAS WHOLLY AND SO CALL'D HIM DOMINIC
AND I SPEAK OF HIM AS THE LABOURER
WHOM CHRIST IN HIS OWN GARDEN CHOSE TO BE
HIS HELP MATE
MESSENGER HE SEEM'D AND FRIEND
FAST KNIT TO CHRIST AND THE FIRST LOVE HE SHOW'D
WAS AFTER THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT CHRIST GAVE
MANY A TIME HIS NURSE AT ENTERING FOUND
THAT HE HAD RIS'N IN SILENCE AND WAS PROSTRATE
AS WHO SHOULD SAY MY ERRAND WAS FOR THIS
O HAPPY FATHER FELIX RIGHTLY NAM'D
O FAVOUR'D MOTHER RIGHTLY NAM'D JOANNA
IF THAT DO MEAN AS MEN INTERPRET IT
NOT FOR THE WORLD'S SAKE FOR WHICH NOW THEY PORE
UPON OSTIENSE AND TADDEO'S PAGE
BUT FOR THE REAL MANNA SOON HE GREW
MIGHTY IN LEARNING AND DID SET HIMSELF
TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD THAT SOON TURNS
TO WAN AND WITHER'D IF NOT TENDED WELL
AND FROM THE SEE WHOSE BOUNTY TO THE JUST
AND NEEDY IS GONE BY NOT THROUGH ITS FAULT
BUT HIS WHO FILLS IT BASELY HE BESOUGHT
NO DISPENSATION FOR COMMUTED WRONG
NOR THE FIRST VACANT FORTUNE NOR THE TENTH
THAT TO GOD'S PAUPERS RIGHTLY APPERTAIN
BUT 'GAINST AN ERRING AND DEGENERATE WORLD
LICENCE TO FIGHT IN FAVOUR OF THAT SEED
FROM WHICH THE TWICE TWELVE CIONS GIRD THEE ROUND
THEN WITH SAGE DOCTRINE AND GOOD WILL TO HELP
FORTH ON HIS GREAT APOSTLESHIP HE FAR'D
LIKE TORRENT BURSTING FROM A LOFTY VEIN
AND DASHING 'GAINST THE STOCKS OF HERESY
SMOTE FIERCEST WHERE RESISTANCE WAS MOST STOUT
THENCE MANY RIVULETS HAVE SINCE BEEN TURN'D
OVER THE GARDEN CATHOLIC TO LEAD
THEIR LIVING WATERS AND HAVE FED ITS PLANTS
IF SUCH ONE WHEEL OF THAT TWO YOKED CAR
WHEREIN THE HOLY CHURCH DEFENDED HER
AND RODE TRIUMPHANT THROUGH THE CIVIL BROIL
THOU CANST NOT DOUBT ITS FELLOW'S EXCELLENCE
WHICH THOMAS ERE MY COMING HATH DECLAR'D
SO COURTEOUSLY UNTO THEE
BUT THE TRACK
WHICH ITS SMOOTH FELLIES MADE IS NOW DESERTED
THAT MOULDY MOTHER IS WHERE LATE WERE LEES
HIS FAMILY THAT WONT TO TRACE HIS PATH
TURN BACKWARD AND INVERT THEIR STEPS ERELONG
TO RUE THE GATHERING IN OF THEIR ILL CROP

O'ERCOME THE MASSIEST AIR THERETO IMAGINE
THE WAIN THAT IN THE BOSOM OF OUR SKY
SPINS EVER ON ITS AXLE NIGHT AND DAY
WITH THE BRIGHT SUMMIT OF THAT HORN WHICH SWELLS
DUE FROM THE POLE ROUND WHICH THE FIRST WHEEL ROLLS
T' HAVE RANG'D THEMSELVES IN FASHION OF TWO SIGNS
IN HEAV'N SUCH AS ARIADNE MADE
WHEN DEATH'S CHILL SEIZED HER AND THAT ONE OF THEM
DID COMPASS IN THE OTHER'S BEAM AND BOTH
IN SUCH SORT WHIRL AROUND THAT EACH SHOULD TEND

BY THE KEEN LANCE BOTH AFTER AND BEFORE

AS CENTRE IN THE ROUND
THAT WHICH DIES NOT
AND THAT WHICH CAN DIE ARE BUT EACH THE BEAM
OF THAT IDEA WHICH OUR SOVERIGN SIRE
ENGENDERETH LOVING FOR THAT LIVELY LIGHT
WHICH PASSETH FROM HIS BRIGHTNESS NOT DISJOIN'D
FROM HIM NOR FROM HIS LOVE TRIUNE WITH THEM
DOTH THROUGH HIS BOUNTY CONGREGATE ITSELF
MIRROR'D AS 'T WERE IN NEW EXISTENCES

HOWE'ER IF LOVE ITSELF DISPOSE AND MARK
THE PRIMAL VIRTUE KINDLING WITH BRIGHT VIEW
THERE ALL PERFECTION IS VOUCHSAFED AND SUCH
THE CLAY WAS MADE ACCOMPLISH'D WITH EACH GIFT
THAT LIFE CAN TEEM WITH SUCH THE BURDEN FILL'D

THY JUDGMENT THAT THE HUMAN NATURE NE'ER

HAVE BEEN AFFORDED IN PARMENIDES
MELISSUS BRYSO AND THE CROWD BESIDE
WHO JOURNEY'D ON AND KNEW NOT WHITHER SO DID
SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THE OTHER FOOLS
WHO LIKE TO SCYMITARS REFLECTED BACK
THE SCRIPTURE IMAGE BY DISTORTION MARR'D
LET NOT THE PEOPLE BE TOO SWIFT TO JUDGE
AS ONE WHO RECKONS ON THE BLADES IN FIELD
OR ERE THE CROP BE RIPE
FOR I HAVE SEEN
THE THORN FROWN RUDELY ALL THE WINTER LONG
AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP
AND BARK THAT ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SEA
RAN STRAIGHT AND SPEEDY PERISH AT THE LAST
E'EN IN THE HAVEN'S MOUTH SEEING ONE STEAL
ANOTHER BRINE HIS OFFERING TO THE PRIEST
LET NOT DAME BIRTHA AND SIR MARTIN THENCE
INTO HEAV'N'S COUNSELS DEEM THAT THEY CAN PRY
FOR ONE OF THESE MAY RISE THE OTHER FALL
CANTO XIV
FROM CENTRE TO THE CIRCLE AND SO BACK
FROM CIRCLE TO THE CENTRE WATER MOVES
IN THE ROUND CHALICE EVEN AS THE BLOW
IMPELS IT INWARDLY OR FROM WITHOUT
SUCH WAS THE IMAGE GLANC'D INTO MY MIND
AS THE GREAT SPIRIT OF AQUINUM CEAS'D
AND BEATRICE AFTER HIM HER WORDS
RESUM'D ALTERNATE NEED THERE IS THO' YET
HE TELLS IT TO YOU NOT IN WORDS NOR E'EN
IN THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD FATHOM TO ITS DEPTH
ANOTHER MYSTERY
TELL HIM IF THE LIGHT
WHEREWITH YOUR SUBSTANCE BLOOMS SHALL STAY WITH YOU
ETERNALLY AS NOW AND IF IT DOTH
HOW WHEN YE SHALL REGAIN YOUR VISIBLE FORMS
THE SIGHT MAY WITHOUT HARM ENDURE THE CHANGE
THAT ALSO TELL AS THOSE WHO IN A RING
TREAD THE LIGHT MEASURE IN THEIR FITFUL MIRTH
RAISE LOUD THE VOICE AND SPRING WITH GLADDER BOUND
THUS AT THE HEARING OF THAT PIOUS SUIT
THE SAINTLY CIRCLES IN THEIR TOURNEYING
AND WOND'ROUS NOTE ATTESTED NEW DELIGHT
WHOSO LAMENTS THAT WE MUST DOFF THIS GARB
OF FRAIL MORTALITY THENCEFORTH TO LIVE
IMMORTALLY ABOVE HE HATH NOT SEEN
THE SWEET REFRESHING OF THAT HEAV'NLY SHOWER
HIM WHO LIVES EVER AND FOR EVER REIGNS
IN MYSTIC UNION OF THE THREE IN ONE
UNBOUNDED BOUNDING ALL EACH SPIRIT THRICE
SANG WITH SUCH MELODY AS BUT TO HEAR
FOR HIGHEST MERIT WERE AN AMPLE MEED
AND FROM THE LESSER ORB THE GOODLIEST LIGHT
WITH GENTLE VOICE AND MILD SUCH AS PERHAPS
THE ANGEL'S ONCE TO MARY THUS REPLIED
LONG AS THE JOY OF PARADISE SHALL LAST
OUR LOVE SHALL SHINE AROUND THAT RAIMENT BRIGHT
AS FERVENT FERVENT AS IN VISION BLEST
AND THAT AS FAR IN BLESSEDNESS EXCEEDING
AS IT HATH GRAVE BEYOND ITS VIRTUE GREAT
OUR SHAPE REGARMENTED WITH GLORIOUS WEEDS
OF SAINTLY FLESH MUST BEING THUS ENTIRE
SHOW YET MORE GRACIOUS
THEREFORE SHALL INCREASE
WHATE'ER OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS IMPARTS
THE SUPREME GOOD LIGHT MINISTERING AID
THE BETTER DISCLOSE HIS GLORY WHENCE
THE VISION NEEDS INCREASING MUCH INCREASE
THE FERVOUR WHICH IT KINDLES AND THAT TOO
THE RAY THAT COMES FROM IT
BUT AS THE GREED
WHICH GIVES OUT FLAME YET IT ITS WHITENESS SHINES
MORE LIVELY THAN THAT AND SO PRESERVES
ITS PROPER SEMBLANCE THUS THIS CIRCLING SPHERE
OF SPLENDOUR SHALL TO VIEW LESS RADIANT SEEM
THAN SHALL OUR FLESHLY ROBE WHICH YONDER EARTH
NOW COVERS
NOR WILL SUCH EXCESS OF LIGHT
O'ERPOWER US IN CORPOREAL ORGANS MADE
FIRM AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF ALL DELIGHT
SO READY AND SO CORDIAL AN AMEN
FOLLOWED FROM EITHER CHOIR AS PLAINLY SPOKE
DESIRE OF THEIR DEAD BODIES YET PERCHANCE
NOT FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR THEIR KINDRED DEAR
MOTHERS AND SIRES AND THOSE WHOM BEST THEY LOV'D
ERE THEY WERE MADE IMPERISHABLE FLAME
AND LO FORTHWITH THERE ROSE UP ROUND ABOUT
A LUSTRE OVER THAT ALREADY THERE
OF EQUAL CLEARNESS LIKE THE BRIGHTENING UP
OF THE HORIZON
AS AT AN EVENING HOUR
OF TWILIGHT NEW APPEARANCES THROUGH HEAV'N
PEER WITH FAINT GLIMMER DOUBTFULLY DESCRIED
SO THERE NEW SUBSTANCES METHOUGHT BEGAN
TO RISE IN VIEW AND ROUND THE OTHER TWAIN
ENWHEELING SWEEP THEIR AMPLER CIRCUIT WIDE
O GENTLE GLITTER OF ETERNAL BEAM
WITH WHAT A SUCH WHITENESS DID IT FLOW
O'ERPOWERING VISION IN ME BUT SO FAIR
SO PASSING LOVELY BEATRICE SHOW'D
MIND CANNOT FOLLOW IT NOR WORDS EXPRESS
HER INFINITE SWEETNESS
THENCE MINE EYES REGAIN'D
POWER TO LOOK UP AND I BEHELD MYSELF
SOLE WITH MY LADY TO MORE LOFTY BLISS
TRANSLATED FOR THE STAR WITH WARMER SMILE
IMPURPLED WELL DENOTED OUR ASCENT
WITH ALL THE HEART AND WITH THAT TONGUE WHICH SPEAKS
THE SAME IN ALL AN HOLOCAUST I MADE
TO GOD BEFITTING THE NEW GRACE VOUCHSAF'D
AND FROM MY BOSOM HAD NOT YET UPSTEAM'D
THE FUMING OF THAT INCENSE WHEN I KNEW
THE RITE ACCEPTED
WITH SUCH MIGHTY SHEEN
AND MANTLING CRIMSON IN TWO LISTED RAYS
THE SPLENDOURS SHOT BEFORE ME THAT I CRIED
GOD OF SABAOTH THAT DOES PRANK THEM THUS
AS LEADS THE GALAXY FROM POLE TO POLE
DISTINGUISH'D INTO GREATER LIGHTS AND LESS
ITS PATHWAY WHICH THE WISEST FAIL TO SPELL
SO THICKLY STUDDED IN THE DEPTH OF MARS
THOSE RAYS DESCRIB'D THE VENERABLE SIGN
THAT QUADRANTS IN THE ROUND CONJOINING FRAME
HERE MEMORY MOCKS THE TOIL OF GENIUS
CHRIST
BEAM'D ON THAT CROSS AND PATTERN FAILS ME NOW
BUT WHOSO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST
WILL PARDON ME FOR THAT I LEAVE UNTOLD
WHEN IN THE FLECKER'D DAWNING HE SHALL SPY
THE GLITTERANCE OF CHRIST
FROM HORN TO HORN
AND 'TWEEN THE SUMMIT AND THE BASE DID MOVE
LIGHTS SCINTILLATING AS THEY MET AND PASS'D
THUS OFT ARE SEEN WITH EVER CHANGEFUL GLANCE
STRAIGHT OR ATHWART NOW RAPID AND NOW SLOW
THE ATOMIES OF BODIES LONG OR SHORT
TO MOVE ALONG THE SUNBEAM WHOSE SLANT LINE
CHECKERS THE SHADOW INTERPOS'D BY ART
AGAINST THE NOONTIDE HEAT
AND AS THE CHIME
OF MINSTREL MUSIC DULCIMER AND HELP
WITH MANY STRINGS A PLEASANT DINING MAKES
TO HIM WHO HEARETH NOT DISTINCT THE NOTE
SO FROM THE LIGHTS WHICH THERE APPEAR'D TO ME
GATHER'D ALONG THE CROSS A MELODY
THAT INDISTINCTLY HEARD WITH RAVISHMENT
POSSESS'D ME
YET I MARK'D IT WAS A HYMN
OF LOFTY PRAISES FOR THERE CAME TO ME
ARISE AND CONQUER AS TO ONE WHO HEARS
AND COMPREHENDS NOT
ME SUCH ECSTASY
O'ERCAME THAT NEVER TILL THAT HOUR WAS THING
THAT HELD ME IN SO SWEET IMPRISONMENT
PERHAPS MY SAYING OVER BOLD APPEARS
ACCOUNTING LESS THE PLEASURE OF THOSE EYES
WHEREON TO LOOK FULFILLETH ALL DESIRE
BUT HE WHO IS AWARE THOSE LIVING SEALS
OF EVERY BEAUTY WORK WITH QUICKER FORCE
THE HIGHER THEY ARE RIS'N AND THAT THERE
I HAD NOT TURN'D ME TO THEM HE MAY WELL
EXCUSE ME THAT WHEREOF IN MY EXCUSE
I DO ACCUSE ME AND MAY OWN MY TRUTH
THAT HOLY PLEASURE HERE NOT YET REVEAL'D
WHICH GROWS IN TRANSPORT AS WE MOUNT ALOOF
CANTO XV
TRUE LOVE THAT EVER SHOWS ITSELF AS CLEAR
IN KINDNESS AS LOOSE APPETITE IN WRONG
SILENCED THAT LYRE HARMONIOUS AND STILL'D
THE SACRED CHORDS THAT ARE BY HEAV'N'S RIGHT HAND
UNWOUND AND TIGHTEN'D FLOW TO RIGHTEOUS PRAYERS
SHOULD THEY NOT HEARKEN WHO TO GIVE ME WILL
FOR PRAYING IN ACCORDANCE THUS WERE MUTE
HE HATH IN SOOTH GOOD CAUSE FOR ENDLESS GRIEF
WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT LASTETH NOT
DESPOILS HIMSELF FOREVER OF THAT LOVE
AS OFT ALONG THE STILL AND PURE SERENE
AT NIGHTFALL GLIDES A SUDDEN TRAIL OF FIRE
ATTRACTING WITH INVOLUNTARY HEED
THE EYE TO FOLLOW IT EREWHILE AT REST
AND SEEMS SOME STAR THAT SHIFTED PLACE IN HEAV'N
ONLY THAT WHENCE IT KINDLES NONE IS LOST
AND IT IS SOON EXTINCT THUS FROM THE HORN
THAT ON THE DEXTER OF THE CROSS EXTENDS
DOWN TO ITS FOOT ONE LUMINARY RAN
FROM MID THE CLUSTER SHONE THERE YET NO GEM
DROPP'D FROM ITS FOIL AND THROUGH THE BEAMY LIST
LIKE FLAME IN ALABASTER GLOW'D ITS COURSE
SO FORWARD STRETCH'D HIM IF OF CREDENCE AUGHT
OUR GREATER MUSE MAY CLAIM THE PIOUS GHOST
OF OLD ANCHISES IN THE' ELYSIAN BOWER
WHEN HE PERCEIV'D HIS SON
O THOU MY BLOOD
O MOST EXCEEDING GRACE DIVINE TO WHOM
AS NOW TO THEE HATH TWICE THE HEAV'NLY GATE
BEEN E'ER UNCLOS'D SO SPAKE THE LIGHT WHENCE I
TURN'D ME TOWARD HIM THEN UNTO MY DAME
MY SIGHT DIRECTED AND ON EITHER SIDE
AMAZEMENT WAITED ME FOR IN HER EYES
WAS LIGHTED SUCH A SMILE I THOUGHT THAT MINE
HAD DIV'D UNTO THE BOTTOM OF MY GRACE
AND OF MY BLISS IN PARADISE
FORTHWITH
TO HEARING AND TO SIGHT GRATEFUL ALIKE
THE SPIRIT TO HIS PROEM ADDED THINGS
I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND HE SPAKE
YET NOT OF CHOICE BUT THROUGH NECESSITY
MYSTERIOUS FOR HIS HIGH CONCEPTION SCAR'D
BEYOND THE MARK OF MORTALS
WHEN THE FLIGHT
OF HOLY TRANSPORT HAD SO SPENT ITS RAGE
THAT NEARER TO THE LEVEL OF OUR THOUGHT
THE SPEECH DESCENDED THE FIRST SOUNDS I HEARD
WERE BEST HE THOU TRIUNAL DEITY
THAT HAST SUCH FAVOUR IN MY SEED VOUCHSAF'D
THEN FOLLOW'D NO UNPLEASANT THIRST THO' LONG
WHICH TOOK ME READING IN THE SACRED BOOK
WHOSE LEAVES OR WHITE OR DUSKY NEVER CHANGE
THOU HAST ALLAY'D MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT
FROM WHENCE MY VOICE THOU HEAR'ST MORE THANKS TO HER
WHO FOR SUCH LOFTY MOUNTING HAS WITH PLUMES
BEGIRT THEE
THOU DOST DEEM THY THOUGHTS TO ME
FROM HIM TRANSMITTED WHO IS FIRST OF ALL
E'EN AS ALL NUMBERS RAY FROM UNITY
AND THEREFORE DOST NOT ASK ME WHO I AM
OR WHY TO THEE MORE JOYOUS I APPEAR
THAN ANY OTHER IN THIS GLADSOME THRONG
THE TRUTH IS AS THOU DEEM'ST FOR IN THIS HUE
BOTH LESS AND GREATER IN THAT MIRROR LOOK
IN WHICH THY THOUGHTS OR ERE THOU THINK'ST ARE SHOWN
BUT THAT THE LOVE WHICH KEEPS ME WAKEFUL EVER
URGING WITH SACRED THIRST OF SWEET DESIRE
MAY BE CONTENDED FULLY LET THY VOICE
FEARLESS AND FRANK AND JOCUND UTTER FORTH
THY WILL DISTINCTLY UTTER FORTH THE WISH
WHERETO MY READY ANSWER STANDS DECREED
I TURN'D ME TO BEATRICE AND SHE HEARD
ERE I HAD SPOKEN SMILING AN ASSENT
THAT TO MY WILL GAVE WINGS AND I BEGAN
TO EACH AMONG YOUR TRIBE WHAT TIME YE KENN'D
THE NATURE IN WHOM NAUGHT UNEQUAL DWELLS
WISDOM AND LOVE WERE IN ONE MEASURE DEALT
FOR THAT THEY ARE SO EQUAL IN THE SUN
FROM WHENCE YE DREW YOUR RADIANCE AND YOUR HEAT
AS MAKES ALL LIKENESS SCANT
BUT WILL AND MEANS
IN MORTALS FOR THE CAUSE YE WELL DISCERN
WITH UNLIKE WINGS ARE FLEDGE
A MORTAL I
EXPERIENCE INEQUALITY LIKE THIS
AND THEREFORE GIVE NO THANKS BUT IN THE HEART
FOR THY PATERNAL GREETING
THIS HOWE'ER
I PRAY THEE LIVING TOPAZ THAT INGEMM'ST
THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL LET ME HEAR THY NAME
I AM THY ROOT O LEAF WHOM TO EXPECT
EVEN HATH PLEAS'D ME THUS THE PROMPT REPLY
PREFACING NEXT IT ADDED HE OF WHOM
THY KINDRED APPELLATION COMES AND WHO
THESE HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE ON ITS FIRST LEDGE
HATH CIRCUITED THE MOUNTAIN WAS MY SON
AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE
WELL BEFITS HIS LONG
ENDURANCE SHOULD BE SHORTEN'D BY THY DEEDS
FLORENCE WITHIN HER ANCIENT LIMIT MARK
WHICH CALLS HER STILL TO MATIN PRAYERS AND NOON
WAS CHASTE AND SOBER AND ABODE IN PEACE
SHE HAD NO ARMLETS AND NO HEAD TIRES THEN
NO PURFLED DAMES NO ZONE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE
MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
TIME WAS NOT YET
WHEN AT HIS DAUGHTER'S BIRTH THE SIRE GREW PALE
FOR FEAR THE AGE AND DOWRY SHOULD EXCEED
ON EACH SIDE JUST PROPORTION
HOUSE WAS NONE
VOID OF ITS FAMILY NOR YET HAD COME
HARDANAPALUS TO EXHIBIT FEATS
OF CHAMBER PROWESS
MONTEMALO YET
O'ER OUR SUBURBAN TURRET ROSE AS MUCH
TO BE SURPASS IN FALL AS IN ITS RISING
I SAW BELLINCIONE BERTI WALK ABROAD
IN LEATHERN GIRDLE AND A CLASP OF BONE
AND WITH NO ARTFUL COLOURING ON HER CHEEKS
HIS LADY LEAVE THE GLASS
THE SONS I SAW
OF NERLI AND OF VECCHIO WELL CONTENT
WITH UNROB'D JERKIN AND THEIR GOOD DAMES HANDLING
THE SPINDLE AND THE FLAX O HAPPY THEY
EACH SURE OF BURIAL IN HER NATIVE LAND
AND NONE LEFT DESOLATE A BED FOR FRANCE
ONE WAK'D TO TEND THE CRADLE HUSHING IT
WITH SOUNDS THAT LULL'D THE PARENT'S INFANCY
ANOTHER WITH HER MAIDENS DRAWING OFF
THE TRESSES FROM THE DISTAFF LECTUR'D THEM
OLD TALES OF TROY AND FESOLE AND ROME
A SALTERELLO AND CIANGHELLA WE
HAD HELD AS STRANGE A MARVEL AS YE WOULD
A CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW
IN SUCH COMPOS'D AND SEEMLY FELLOWSHIP
SUCH FAITHFUL AND SUCH FAIR EQUALITY
IN SO SWEET HOUSEHOLD MARY AT MY BIRTH
BESTOW'D ME CALL'D ON WITH LOUD CRIES AND THERE
IN YOUR OLD BAPTISTERY I WAS MADE
CHRISTIAN AT ONCE AND CACCIAGUIDA AS WERE
MY BRETHREN ELISEO AND MORONTO
FROM VALDIPADO CAME TO ME MY SPOUSE
AND HENCE THY SURNAME GREW
I FOLLOW'D THEN
THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND HIS KNIGHTHOOD HE
DID GIRD ON ME IN SUCH GOOD PART HE TOOK
MY VALIANT SERVICE
AFTER HIM I WENT
TO TESTIFY AGAINST THAT EVIL LAW
WHOSE PEOPLE BY THE SHEPHERD'S FAULT POSSESS
YOUR RIGHT USURPING
THERE BY THAT FOUL CREW
WAS I RELEAS'D FROM THE DECEITFUL WORLD
WHOSE BASE AFFECTION MANY A SPIRIT SOILS
AND FROM THE MARTYRDOM CAME TO THIS PEACE
CANTO XVI
O SLIGHT RESPECT OF MAN'S NOBILITY
I NEVER SHALL ACCOUNT IT MARVELOUS
THAT OUR INFIRM AFFECTION HERE BELOW
THOU MOV'ST TO BOASTING WHEN I COULD NOT CHOOSE
E'EN IN THAT REGION OF UNWARP'D DESIRE
IN HEAV'N ITSELF BUT MAKE MY VAUNT IN THEE
YET CLOAK THOU ART SOON SHORTEN'D FOR THAT TIME
UNLESS THOU BE EKED OUT FROM DAY TO DAY
GOES ROUND THEE WITH HIS SHEARS
RESUMING THEN
WITH GREETING SUCH AS ROME WAS FIRST TO BEAR
BUT SINCE HATH DISACCUSTOM'D I BEGAN
AND BEATRICE THAT A LITTLE SPACE
WAS SEVER'D SMIL'D REMINDING ME OF HER
WHOSE COUGH EMBOLDEN'D AS THE STORY HOLDS
TO FIRST OFFENCE THE DOUBTING GUENEVER
YOU ARE MY SIRE SAID I YOU GIVE ME HEART
FREELY TO SPEAK MY THOUGHT ABOVE MYSELF
YOU RAISE ME
THROUGH SO MANY STREAMS WITH JOY
MY SOUL IS FILL'D THAT GLADNESS WELLS FROM IT
SO THAT IT BEARS THE MIGHTY TIDE AND BURSTS NOT
SAY THEN MY HONOUR'D STEM WHAT ANCESTORS
WHERE THOSE YOU SPRANG FROM AND WHAT YEARS WERE MARK'D
IN YOUR FIRST CHILDHOOD TELL ME OF THE FOLD
THAT HATH SAINT JOHN FOR GUARDIAN WHAT WAS THEN
ITS STATE AND WHO IN IT WERE HIGHEST SEATED
AS EMBERS AT THE BREATHING OF THE WIND
THEIR FLAME ENLIVEN SO THAT LIGHT I SAW
SHINE AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS IT GREW
MORE FAIR TO LOOK ON SO WITH VOICE MORE SWEET
YET NOT IN THIS OUR MODERN PHRASE FORTHWITH
IT ANSWER'D FROM THE DAY WHEN IT WAS SAID
'HAIL VIRGIN TO THE THROES BY WHICH MY MOTHER
WHO NOW IS SAINTED LIGHTEN'D HER OF ME
WHOM SHE WAS HEAVY WITH THIS FIRE HAD COME
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THRICE ITS BEAMS
TO REILUMINE UNDERNEATH THE FOOT
OF ITS OWN LION
THEY OF WHOM I SPRANG
AND I HAD THERE OUR BIRTH PLACE WHERE THE LAST
PARTITION OF OUR CITY FIRST IS REACH'D
BY HIM THAT RUNS HER ANNUAL GAME
THUS MUCH
SUFFICE OF MY FOREFATHERS WHO THEY WERE
AND WHENCE THEY HITHER CAME MORE HONOURABLE
IT IS TO PASS IN SILENCE THAN TO TELL
ALL THOSE WHO IN THAT TIME WERE THERE FROM MARS
UNTIL THE BAPTIST FIT TO CARRY ARMS
WERE BUT THE FIFTH OF THEM THIS DAY ALIVE
BUT THEN THE CITIZEN'S BLOOD THAT NOW IS MIX'D
FROM CAMPI AND CERTALDO AND FIGHINE
RAN PURELY THROUGH THE LAST MECHANIC'S VEINS
O HOW MUCH BETTER WERE IT THAT THESE PEOPLE
WERE NEIGHBOURS TO YOU AND THAT AT GALLUZZO
AND AT TRESPIANO YE SHOULD HAVE YOUR BOUND'RY
THAN TO HAVE THEM WITHIN AND BEAR THE STENCH
OF AGUGLIONE'S HIND AND SIGNA'S HIM
THAT HATH HIS EYE ALREADY KEEN FOR BART'RING
HAD NOT THE PEOPLE WHICH OF ALL THE WORLD
DEGENERATES MOST BEEN STEPDAME UNTO CAESAR
BUT AS A MOTHER GRACIOUS TO HER SON
SUCH ONE AS HATH BECOME A FLORENTINE
AND TRADES AND TRAFFICS HAD BEEN TURN'D ADRIFT
TO SIMIFONTE WHERE HIS GRANDSIRE PLY'D
THE BEGGAR'S CRAFT
THE CONTI WERE POSSESS'D
OF MONTEMURLO STILL THE CERCHI STILL
WERE IN ACONE'S PARISH NOR HAD HAPLY
FROM VALDIGRIEVE PAST THE BUONDELMONTE
THE CITY'S MALADY HATH EVER SOURCE
IN THE CONFUSION OF ITS PERSONS AS
THE BODY'S IN VARIETY OF FOOD
AND THE BLIND BULL FALLS WITH A STEEPER PLUNGE
THAN THE BLIND LAMB AND OFTENTIMES ONE SWORD
DOTH MORE AND BETTER EXECUTION
THAN FIVE
MARK LUNI URBISAGLIA MARK
HOW THEY ARE GONE AND AFTER THEM HOW GO
CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AND 'T WILL SEEM
NO LONGER NEW OR STRANGE TO THEE TO HEAR
THAT FAMILIES FAIL WHEN CITIES HAVE THEIR END
ALL THINGS THAT APPERTAIN T' YE LIKE YOURSELVES
ARE MORTAL BUT MORTALITY IN SOME
YE MARK NOT THEY ENDURE SO LONG AND YOU
PASS BY SO SUDDENLY
AND AS THE MOON
DOTH BY THE ROLLING OF HER HEAV'NLY SPHERE
HIDE AND REVEAL THE STRAND UNCEASINGLY
SO FORTUNE DEALS WITH FLORENCE
HENCE ADMIRE NOT
AT WHAT OF THEM I TELL THEE WHOSE RENOWN
TIME COVERS THE FIRST FLORENTINES
I SAW
THE UGHI CATILINI AND FILIPPI
THE ALBERICHI GRECI AND ORMANNI
NOW IN THEIR WANE ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS
AND GREAT AS ANCIENT OF SANNELLA HIM
WITH HIM OF ARCA SAW AND SOLDANIERI
AND ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI
AT THE POOP
THAT NOW IS LADEN WITH NEW FELONY
SO CUMB'ROUS IT MAY SPEEDILY SINK THE BARK
THE RAVIGNANI SAT OF WHOM IS SPRUNG
THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOSO HATH SINCE
HIS TITLE FROM THE FAM'D BELLINCIONE TA'EN
FAIR GOVERNANCE WAS YET AN ART WELL PRIZ'D
BY HIM OF PRESSA GALIGAIO SHOW'D
THE GILDED HILT AND POMMEL IN HIS HOUSE
THE COLUMN CLOTH'D WITH VERREY STILL WAS SEEN
UNSHAKEN THE SACCHETTI STILL WERE GREAT
GIOUCHI SIFANTI GALLI AND BARUCCI
WITH THEM WHO BLUSH TO HEAR THE BUSHEL NAM'D
OF THE CALFUCCI STILL THE BRANCHY TRUNK
WAS IN ITS STRENGTH AND TO THE CURULE CHAIRS
SIZII AND ARIGUCCI YET WERE DRAWN
HOW MIGHTY THEM I SAW WHOM SINCE THEIR PRIDE
HATH UNDONE AND IN ALL HER GOODLY DEEDS
FLORENCE WAS BY THE BULLETS OF BRIGHT GOLD
O'ERFLOURISH'D
SUCH THE SIRES OF THOSE WHO NOW
AS SURELY AS YOUR CHURCH IS VACANT FLOCK
INTO HER CONSISTORY AND AT LEISURE
THERE STALL THEM AND GROW FAT
THE O'ERWEENING BROOD
THAT PLAYS THE DRAGON AFTER HIM THAT FLEES
BUT UNTO SUCH AS TURN AND SHOW THE TOOTH
AY OR THE PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
WAS ON ITS RISE BUT YET SO SLIGHT ESTEEM'D
THAT UBERTINO OF DONATI GRUDG'D
HIS FATHER IN LAW SHOULD YOKE HIM TO ITS TRIBE
ALREADY CAPONSACCO HAD DESCENDED
INTO THE MART FROM FESOLE AND GIUDA
AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD CITIZENS
A THING INCREDIBLE I TELL THO' TRUE
THE GATEWAY NAMED FROM THOSE OF PERA LED
INTO THE NARROW CIRCUIT OF YOUR WALLS
EACH ONE WHO BEARS THE SIGHTLY QUARTERINGS
OF THE GREAT BARON HE WHOSE NAME AND WORTH
THE FESTIVAL OF THOMAS STILL REVIVES
HIS KNIGHTHOOD AND HIS PRIVILEGE RETAIN'D
ALBEIT ONE WHO BORDERS THEM WITH GOLD
THIS DAY IS MINGLED WITH THE COMMON HERD
IN BORGO YET THE GUALTEROTTI DWELT
AND IMPORTUNI WELL FOR ITS REPOSE
HAD IT STILL LACK'D OF NEWER NEIGHBOURHOOD
THE HOUSE FROM WHENCE YOUR TEARS HAVE HAD THEIR SPRING
THROUGH THE JUST ANGER THAT HATH MURDER'D YE
AND PUT A PERIOD TO YOUR GLADSOME DAYS
WAS HONOUR'D IT AND THOSE CONSORTED WITH IT
O BUONDELMONTE WHAT ILL COUNSELING
PREVAIL'D ON THEE TO BREAK THE PLIGHTED BOND
MANY WHO NOW ARE WEEPING WOULD REJOICE
HAD GOD TO EMA GIV'N THEE THE FIRST TIME
THOU NEAR OUR CITY CAM'ST
BUT SO WAS DOOM'D
ON THAT MAIM'D STONE SET UP TO GUARD THE BRIDGE
AT THY LAST PEACE THE VICTIM FLORENCE FELL
WITH THESE AND OTHERS LIKE TO THEM I SAW
FLORENCE IN SUCH ASSUR'D TRANQUILITY
SHE HAD NO CAUSE AT WHICH TO GRIEVE WITH THESE
SAW HER SO GLORIOUS AND SO JUST THAT NE'ER
THE LILY FROM THE LANCE HAD HUNG REVERSE
OR THROUGH DIVISION BEEN WITH VERMEIL DYED
CANTO XVII
SUCH AS THE YOUTH WHO CAME TO CLYMENE
TO CERTIFY HIMSELF OF THAT REPROACH
WHICH HAD BEEN FASTEN'D ON HIM HE WHOSE END
STILL MAKES THE FATHERS CHARY TO THEIR SONS
E'EN SUCH WAS I NOR UNOBSERV'D WAS SUCH
OF BEATRICE AND THAT SAINTLY LAMP
WHO HAD EREWHILE FOR ME HIS STATION MOV'D
WHEN THUS BY LADY GIVE THY WISH FREE VENT
THAT IT MAY ISSUE BEARING TRUE REPORT
OF THE MIND'S IMPRESS NOT THAT AUGHT THY WORDS
MAY TO OUR KNOWLEDGE ADD BUT TO THE END
THAT THOU MAYST USE THYSELF TO OWN THY THIRST
AND MEN MAY MINGLE FOR THEE WHEN THEY HEAR
O PLANT FROM WHENCE I SPRING REVER'D AND LOV'D
WHO SOAR'ST SO HIGH A PITCH THOU SEEST AS CLEAR
AS EARTHLY THOUGHT DETERMINES TWO OBTUSE

WITH VIRGIL THE SOUL PURIFYING MOUNT
AND VISITED THE NETHER WORLD OF WOE
TOUCHING MY FUTURE DESTINY HAVE HEARD
WORDS GRIEVOUS THOUGH I FEEL ME ON ALL SIDES
WELL SQUAR'D TO FORTUNE'S BLOWS
THEREFORE MY WILL
WERE SATISFIED TO KNOW THE LOT AWAITS ME
THE ARROW SEEN BEFOREHAND SLACKS ITS FLIGHT
SO SAID I TO THE BRIGHTNESS WHICH EREWHILE
TO ME HAD SPOKEN AND MY WILL DECLAR'D
AS BEATRICE WILL'D EXPLICITLY
NOR WITH ORACULAR RESPONSE OBSCURE
SUCH AS OR ERE THE LAMB OF GOD WAS SLAIN
BEGUIL'D THE CREDULOUS NATIONS BUT IN TERMS
PRECISE AND UNAMBIGUOUS LORE REPLIED
THE SPIRIT OF PATERNAL LOVE ENSHRIN'D
YET IN HIS SMILE APPARENT AND THUS SPAKE
CONTINGENCY UNFOLDED NOT TO VIEW
UPON THE TABLET OF YOUR MORTAL MOLD
IS ALL DEPICTUR'D IN THE' ETERNAL SIGHT
BUT HENCE DERIVETH NOT NECESSITY
MORE THEN THE TALL SHIP HURRIED DOWN THE FLOOD
DOTH FROM THE VISION THAT REFLECTS THE SCENE
FROM THENCE AS TO THE EAR SWEET HARMONY
FROM ORGAN COMES SO COMES BEFORE MINE EYE
THE TIME PREPAR'D FOR THEE
SUCH AS DRIV'N OUT
FROM ATHENS BY HIS CRUEL STEPDAME'S WILES
HIPPOLYTUS DEPARTED SUCH MUST THOU
DEPART FROM FLORENCE
THIS THEY WISH AND THIS
CONTRIVE AND WILL ERE LONG EFFECTUATE THERE
WHERE GAINFUL MERCHANDIZE IS MADE OF CHRIST
THROUGHOUT THE LIVELONG DAY
THE COMMON CRY
WILL AS 'T IS EVER WONT AFFIX THE BLAME
UNTO THE PARTY INJUR'D BUT THE TRUTH
SHALL IN THE VENGEANCE IT DISPENSETH FIND
A FAITHFUL WITNESS
THOU SHALL LEAVE EACH THING
BELOV'D MOST DEARLY THIS IS THE FIRST SHAFT
SHOT FROM THE BOW OF EXILE
THOU SHALT PROVE
HOW SALT THE SAVOUR IS OF OTHER'S BREAD
HOW HARD THE PASSAGE TO DESCEND AND CLIMB
BY OTHER'S STAIRS BUT THAT SHALL GALL THEE MOST
WILL BE THE WORTHLESS AND VILE COMPANY
WITH WHOM THOU MUST BE THROWN INTO THESE STRAITS
FOR ALL UNGRATEFUL IMPIOUS ALL AND MAD
SHALL TURN 'GAINST THEE BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE
THEIRS AND NOT THINE SHALL BE THE CRIMSON'D BROW
THEIR COURSE SHALL SO EVINCE THEIR BRUTISHNESS
T' HAVE TA'EN THY STAND APART SHALL WELL BECOME THEE
FIRST REFUGE THOU MUST FIND FIRST PLACE OF REST
IN THE GREAT LOMBARD'S COURTESY WHO BEARS
UPON THE LADDER PERCH'D THE SACRED BIRD
HE SHALL BEHOLD THEE WITH SUCH KIND REGARD
THAT 'TWIXT YE TWO THE CONTRARY TO THAT
WHICH FALLS 'TWIXT OTHER MEN THE GRANTING SHALL
FORERUN THE ASKING
WITH HIM SHALT THOU SEE
THAT MORTAL WHO WAS AT HIS BIRTH IMPRESS
SO STRONGLY FROM THIS STAR THAT OF HIS DEEDS
THE NATIONS SHALL TAKE NOTE
HIS UNRIPE AGE
YET HOLDS HIM FROM OBSERVANCE FOR THESE WHEELS
ONLY NINE YEARS HAVE COMPASS HIM ABOUT
BUT ERE THE GASCON PRACTICE ON GREAT HARRY
SPARKLES OF VIRTUE SHALL SHOOT FORTH IN HIM
IN EQUAL SCORN OF LABOURS AND OF GOLD
HIS BOUNTY SHALL BE SPREAD ABROAD SO WIDELY
AS NOT TO LET THE TONGUES E'EN OF HIS FOES
BE IDLE IN ITS PRAISE
LOOK THOU TO HIM
AND HIS BENEFICENCE FOR HE SHALL CAUSE
REVERSAL OF THEIR LOT TO MANY PEOPLE
RICH MEN AND BEGGARS INTERCHANGING FORTUNES
AND THOU SHALT BEAR THIS WRITTEN IN THY SOUL
OF HIM BUT TELL IT NOT AND THINGS HE TOLD
INCREDIBLE TO THOSE WHO WITNESS THEM
THEN ADDED SO INTERPRET THOU MY SON
WHAT HATH BEEN TOLD THEE LO THE AMBUSHMENT
THAT A FEW CIRCLING SEASONS HIDE FOR THEE
YET ENVY NOT THY NEIGHBOURS TIME EXTENDS
THY SPAN BEYOND THEIR TREASON'S CHASTISEMENT
SOON AS THE SAINTLY SPIRIT BY HIS SILENCE
HAD SHOWN THE WEB WHICH I HAD STRETEH'D FOR HIM
UPON THE WARP WAS WOVEN I BEGAN
AS ONE WHO IN PERPLEXITY DESIRES
COUNSEL OF OTHER WISE BENIGN AND FRIENDLY
MY FATHER WELL I MARK HOW TIME SPURS ON
TOWARD ME READY TO INFLICT THE BLOW
WHICH FALLS MOST HEAVILY ON HIM WHO MOST
ABANDONED HIMSELF
THEREFORE 'T IS GOOD
I SHOULD FORECAST THAT DRIVEN FROM THE PLACE
MOST DEAR TO ME I MAY NOT LOSE MYSELF
ALL OTHERS BY MY SONG
DOWN THROUGH THE WORLD
OF INFINITE MOURNING AND ALONG THE MOUNT
FROM WHOSE FAIR HEIGHT MY LADY'S EYES DID LIFT ME
AND AFTER THROUGH THIS HEAV'N FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT
HAVE I LEARNT THAT WHICH IF I TELL AGAIN
IT MAY WITH MANY WOEFULLY DISRELISH
AND IF I AM A TIMID FRIEND TO TRUTH
I FEAR MY LIFE MAY PERISH AMONG THOSE
TO WHOM THESE DAYS SHALL BE OF ANCIENT DATE
THE BRIGHTNESS WHERE ENCLOS'D THE TREASURE SMIL'D
WHICH I HAD FOUND THERE FIRST SHONE GLISTENINGLY
LIKE TO A GOLDEN MIRROR IN THE SUN
NEXT ANSWER'D CONSCIENCE DIMM'D OR BY ITS OWN
OR OTHER'S SHAME WILL FEEL THY SAYING SHARP
THOU NOTWITHSTANDING ALL DECEIT REMOV'D
SEE THE WHOLE VISION BE MADE MANIFEST
AND LET THEM WINCE WHO HAVE THEIR WITHERS WRUNG
WHAT THOUGH WHEN TASTED FIRST THY VOICE SHALL PROVE
UNWELCOME ON DIGESTION IT WILL TURN
TO VITAL NOURISHMENT
THE CRY THOU RAISEST
SHALL AS THE WIND DOTH SMITE THE PROUDEST SUMMITS
WHICH IS OF HONOUR NO LIGHT ARGUMENT
FOR THIS THERE ONLY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO THEE
THROUGHOUT THESE ORBS THE MOUNTAIN AND THE DEEP
SPIRITS WHOM FAME HATH NOTE OF
FOR THE MIND
OF HIM WHO HEARS IS LOTH TO ACQUIESCE
AND FIX ITS FAITH UNLESS THE INSTANCE BROUGHT
BE PALPABLE AND PROOF APPARENT URGE
CANTO XVIII
CANTO XVIII
NOW IN HIS WORD SOLE RUMINATING JOY'D

ON OTHER THOUGHTS BETHINK THEE THAT NEAR HIM
I DWELL WHO RECOMPENSETH EVERY WRONG
AT THE SWEET SOUNDS OF COMFORT STRAIGHT I TURN'D
AND IN THE SAINTLY EYES WHAT LOVE WAS SEEN
I LEAVE IN SILENCE HERE NOR THROUGH DISTRUST
OF MY WORDS ONLY BUT THAT TO SUCH BLISS
THE MIND REMOUNTS NOT WITHOUT AID
THUS MUCH
YET MAY I SPEAK THAT AS I GAZ'D ON HER
AFFECTION FOUND NO ROOM FOR OTHER WISH
WHILE THE EVERLASTING PLEASURE THAT DID FULL
ON BEATRICE SHINE WITH SECOND VIEW
FROM HER FAIR COUNTENANCE MY GLADDEN'D SOUL
CONTENTED VANQUISHING ME WITH A BEAM
OF HER SOFT SMILE SHE SPAKE TURN THEE AND LIST
THESE EYES ARE NOT THY ONLY PARADISE
AS HERE WE SOMETIMES IN THE LOOKS MAY SEE
TH' AFFECTION MARK'D WHEN THAT ITS SWAY HATH TA'EN

THAT WERE BELOW ERE THEY ARRIV'D IN HEAV'N
SO MIGHTY IN RENOWN AS EVERY MUSE
MIGHT GRACE HER TRIUMPH WITH THEM

LOOK THEREFORE OF THE CROSS HE WHOM I NAME
SHALL THERE ENACT AS DOTH IN SUMMER CLOUD
ITS NIMBLE FIRE ALONG THE CROSS I SAW
AT THE REPEATED NAME OF JOSHUA
A SPLENDOUR GLIDING NOR THE WORD WAS SAID
ERE IT WAS DONE THEN AT THE NAMING SAW
OF THE GREAT MACCABEE ANOTHER MOVE
WITH WHIRLING SPEED AND GLADNESS WAS THE SCOURGE
UNTO THAT TOP
THE NEXT FOR CHARLEMAGNE
AND FOR THE PEER ORLANDO TWO MY GAZE
PURSUED INTENTLY AS THE EYE PURSUES
A FALCON FLYING
LAST ALONG THE CROSS
WILLIAM AND RENARD AND DUKE GODFREY DREW
MY KEN AND ROBERT GUISCARD
AND THE SOUL
WHO SPAKE WITH ME AMONG THE OTHER LIGHTS
DID MOVE AWAY AND MIX AND WITH THE CHOIR
OF HEAV'NLY SONGSTERS PROV'D HIS TUNEFUL SKILL
TO BEATRICE ON MY RIGHT L BENT
LOOKING FOR INTIMATION OR BY WORD
OR ACT WHAT NEXT BEHOOV'D AND DID DESCRY
SUCH MERE EFFULGENCE IN HER EYES SUCH JOY
IT PAST ALL FORMER WONT
AND AS BY SENSE
OF NEW DELIGHT THE MAN WHO PERSEVERES
IN GOOD DEEDS DOTH PERCEIVE FROM DAY TO DAY
HIS VIRTUE GROWING I E'EN THUS PERCEIV'D
OF MY ASCENT TOGETHER WITH THE HEAV'N
THE CIRCUIT WIDEN'D NOTING THE INCREASE
OF BEAUTY IN THAT WONDER
LIKE THE CHANGE
IN A BRIEF MOMENT ON SOME MAIDEN'S CHEEK
WHICH FROM ITS FAIRNESS DOTH DISCHARGE THE WEIGHT
OF PUDENCY THAT STAIN'D IT SUCH IN HER
AND TO MINE EYES SO SUDDEN WAS THE CHANGE
THROUGH SILVERY WHITENESS OF THAT TEMPERATE STAR
WHOSE SIXTH ORB NOW ENFOLDED US
I SAW
WITHIN THAT JOVIAL CRESSET THE CLEAR SPARKS
OF LOVE THAT REIGN'D THERE FASHION TO MY VIEW
OUR LANGUAGE
AND AS BIRDS FROM RIVER BANKS
ARISEN NOW IN ROUND NOW LENGTHEN'D TROOP
ARRAY THEM IN THEIR FLIGHT GREETING AS SEEMS
THEIR NEW FOUND PASTURES SO WITHIN THE LIGHTS
THE SAINTLY CREATURES FLYING SANG AND MADE
NOW D
NOW I
NOW L
FIGUR'D I' TH' AIR
FIRST SINGING TO THEIR NOTES THEY MOV'D THEN ONE
BECOMING OF THESE SIGNS A LITTLE WHILE
DID REST THEM AND WERE MUTE
O NYMPH DIVINE
OF PEGASEAN RACE WHOSE SOULS WHICH THOU
INSPIR'ST MAK'ST GLORIOUS AND LONG LIV'D AS THEY
CITIES AND REALMS BY THEE THOU WITH THYSELF
INFORM ME THAT I MAY SET FORTH THE SHAPES
AS FANCY DOTH PRESENT THEM
BE THY POWER
DISPLAY'D IN THIS BRIEF SONG
THE CHARACTERS
VOCAL AND CONSONANT WERE FIVE FOLD SEVEN
IN ORDER EACH AS THEY APPEAR'D I MARK'D
DILIGITE JUSTITIAM THE FIRST
BOTH VERB AND NOUN ALL BLAZON'D AND THE EXTREME
QUI JUDICATIS TERRAM
IN THE M
OF THE FIFTH WORD THEY HELD THEIR STATION
MAKING THE STAR SEEM SILVER STREAK'D WITH GOLD
AND ON THE SUMMIT OF THE M
I SAW
DESCENDING OTHER LIGHTS THAT RESTED THERE
SINGING METHINKS THEIR BLISS AND PRIMAL GOOD
THEN AS AT SHAKING OF A LIGHTED BRAND
SPARKLES INNUMERABLE ON ALL SIDES
RISE SCATTER'D SOURCE OF AUGURY TO TH' UNWISE
THUS MORE THAN THOUSAND TWINKLING LUSTRES HENCE
SEEM'D REASCENDING AND A HIGHER PITCH
SOME MOUNTING AND SOME LESS E'EN AS THE SUN
WHICH KINDLETH THEM DECREED
AND WHEN EACH ONE
HAD SETTLED IN HIS PLACE THE HEAD AND NECK
THEN SAW I OF AN EAGLE LIVELY
GRAV'D IN THAT STREAKY FIRE
WHO PAINTETH THERE
HATH NONE TO GUIDE HIM OF HIMSELF HE GUIDES
AND EVERY LINE AND TEXTURE OF THE NEST
DOTH OWN FROM HIM THE VIRTUE FASHIONS IT
THE OTHER BRIGHT BEATITUDE THAT SEEM'D
EREWHILE WITH LILIED CROWNING WELL CONTENT
TO OVER CANOPY THE M
MOV'D FORTH
FOLLOWING GENTLY THE IMPRESS OF THE BIRD
SWEET STAR WHAT GLORIOUS AND THICK STUDDED GEMS
DECLAR'D TO ME OUR JUSTICE ON THE EARTH
TO BE THE EFFLUENCE OF THAT HEAV'N WHICH THOU
THYSELF A COSTLY JEWEL DOST INLAY
THEREFORE I PRAY THE SOVRAN MIND FROM WHOM
THY MOTION AND THY VIRTUE ARE BEGUN
THAT HE WOULD LOOK FROM WHENCE THE FOG DOTH RISE
TO VITIATE THY BEAM SO THAT ONCE MORE
HE MAY PUT FORTH HIS HAND 'GAINST SUCH AS DRIVE
THEIR TRAFFIC IN THAT SANCTUARY WHOSE WALLS
WITH MIRACLES AND MARTYRDOMS WERE BUILT
YE HOST OF HEAVEN WHOSE GLORY I SURVEY
O BEG YE GRACE FOR THOSE THAT ARE ON EARTH
ALL AFTER ILL EXAMPLE GONE ASTRAY
WAR ONCE HAD FOR ITS INSTRUMENT THE SWORD
BUT NOW 'T IS MADE TAKING THE BREAD AWAY
WHICH THE GOOD FATHER LOCKS FROM NONE
AND THOU
THAT WRITES BUT TO CANCEL THINK THAT THEY
WHO FOR THE VINEYARD WHICH THOU WASTEST DIED
PETER AND PAUL LIVE YET AND MARK THY DOINGS
THOU HAST GOOD CAUSE TO CRY MY HEART SO CLEAVES
TO HIM THAT LIV'D IN SOLITUDE REMOTE
AND FROM THE WILDS WAS DRAGG'D TO MARTYRDOM
I WIST NOT OF THE FISHERMAN NOR PAUL
CANTO XIX
BEFORE MY SIGHT APPEAR'D WITH OPEN WINGS
THE BEAUTEOUS IMAGE IN FRUITION SWEET
GLADDENING THE THRONGED SPIRITS
EACH DID SEEM
A LITTLE RUBY WHEREON SO INTENSE
THE SUN BEAM GLOW'D THAT TO MINE EYES IT CAME
IN CLEAR REFRACTION
AND THAT WHICH NEXT
BEFALLS ME TO PORTRAY VOICE HATH NOT UTTER'D
NOR HATH INK WRITTEN NOR IN FANTASY
WAS E'ER CONCEIV'D
FOR I BEHELD AND HEARD
THE BEAK DISCOURSE AND WHAT INTENTION FORM'D
OF MANY SINGLY AS OF ONE EXPRESS
BEGINNING FOR THAT I WAS JUST AND PITEOUS
L AM EXALTED TO THIS HEIGHT OF GLORY
THE WHICH NO WISH EXCEEDS AND THERE ON EARTH
HAVE I MY MEMORY LEFT E'EN BY THE BAD
COMMENDED WHILE THEY LEAVE ITS COURSE UNTROD
THUS IS ONE HEAT FROM MANY EMBERS FELT
AS IN THAT IMAGE MANY WERE THE LOVES
AND ONE THE VOICE THAT ISSUED FROM THEM ALL
WHENCE I ADDRESS THEM O PERENNIAL FLOWERS
OF GLADNESS EVERLASTING THAT EXHALE
IN SINGLE BREATH YOUR ODOURS MANIFOLD
BREATHE NOW AND LET THE HUNGER BE APPEAS'D
THAT WITH GREAT CRAVING LONG HATH HELD MY SOUL
FINDING NO FOOD ON EARTH
THIS WELL I KNOW
THAT IF THERE BE IN HEAV'N A REALM THAT SHOWS
IN FAITHFUL MIRROR THE CELESTIAL JUSTICE
YOURS WITHOUT VEIL REFLECTS IT
YE DISCERN
THE HEED WHEREWITH I DO PREPARE MYSELF
TO HEARKEN YE THE DOUBT THAT URGES ME
WITH SUCH INVETERATE CRAVING STRAIGHT I SAW
LIKE TO A FALCON ISSUING FROM THE HOOD
THAT REARS HIS HEAD AND CLAPS HIM WITH HIS WINGS
HIS BEAUTY AND HIS EAGERNESS BEWRAYING
SO SAW I MOVE THAT STATELY SIGN WITH PRAISE
OF GRACE DIVINE INWOVEN AND HIGH SONG
OF INEXPRESSIVE JOY
HE IT BEGAN
WHO TURN'D HIS COMPASS ON THE WORLD'S EXTREME
AND IN THAT SPACE SO VARIOUSLY HATH WROUGHT
BOTH OPENLY AND IN SECRET IN SUCH WISE
COULD NOT THROUGH ALL THE UNIVERSE DISPLAY
IMPRESSION OF HIS GLORY THAT THE WORD
OF HIS OMNISCIENCE SHOULD NOT STILL REMAIN
IN INFINITE EXCESS
IN PROOF WHEREOF
HE FIRST THROUGH PRIDE SUPPLANTED WHO WAS SUM
OF EACH CREATED BEING WAITED NOT
FOR LIGHT CELESTIAL AND ABORTIVE FELL
WHENCE NEEDS EACH LESSER NATURE IS BUT SCANT
RECEPTACLE UNTO THAT GOOD WHICH KNOWS
NO LIMIT MEASUR'D BY ITSELF ALONE
THEREFORE YOUR SIGHT OF TH' OMNIPRESENT MIND
A SINGLE BEAM ITS ORIGIN MUST OWN
SURPASSING FAR ITS UTMOST POTENCY
THE KEN YOUR WORLD IS GIFTED WITH DESCENDS
IN TH' EVERLASTING JUSTICE AS LOW DOWN
AS EYE DOTH IN THE SEA WHICH THOUGH IT MARK
THE BOTTOM FROM THE SHORE IN THE WIDE MAIN
DISCERNS IT NOT AND NE'ERTHELESS IT IS
BUT HIDDEN THROUGH ITS DEEPNESS
LIGHT IS NONE
SAVE THAT WHICH COMETH FROM THE PURE SERENE
OF NE'ER DISTURBED ETHER FOR THE REST
'TIS DARKNESS ALL OR SHADOW OF THE FLESH
OR ELSE ITS POISON
HERE CONFESS REVEAL'D
THAT COVERT WHICH HATH HIDDEN FROM THY SEARCH
THE LIVING JUSTICE OF THE WHICH THOU MAD'ST
SUCH FREQUENT QUESTION FOR THOU SAIDST 'A MAN
IS BORN ON INDUS' BANKS AND NONE IS THERE
WHO SPEAKS OF CHRIST NOR WHO DOTH READ NOR WRITE
AND ALL HIS INCLINATIONS AND HIS ACTS
AS FAR AS HUMAN REASON SEES ARE GOOD
AND HE OFFENDETH NOT IN WORD OR DEED
BUT UNBAPTIZ'D HE DIES AND VOID OF FAITH
WHERE IS THE JUSTICE THAT CONDEMNS HIM WHERE
HIS BLAME IF HE BELIEVETH NOT WHAT THEN
AND WHO ART THOU THAT ON THE STOOL WOULDST SIT
TO JUDGE AT DISTANCE OF A THOUSAND MILES
WITH THE SHORT SIGHTED VISION OF A SPAN
TO HIM WHO SUBTILIZES THUS WITH ME
THERE WOULD ASSUREDLY BE ROOM FOR DOUBT
EVEN TO WONDER DID NOT THE SAFE WORD
OF SCRIPTURE HOLD SUPREME AUTHORITY
O ANIMALS OF CLAY O SPIRITS GROSS I
THE PRIMAL WILL THAT IN ITSELF IS GOOD
HATH FROM ITSELF THE CHIEF GOOD NE'ER BEEN MOV'D
JUSTICE CONSISTS IN CONSONANCE WITH IT
DERIVABLE BY NO CREATED GOOD
WHOSE VERY CAUSE DEPENDS UPON ITS BEAM
AS ON HER NEST THE STORK THAT TURNS ABOUT
UNTO HER YOUNG WHOM LATELY SHE HATH FED
WHILE THEY WITH UPWARD EYES DO LOOK ON HER
SO LIFTED I MY GAZE AND BENDING SO
THE EVER BLESSED IMAGE WAV'D ITS WINGS
LAB'RING WITH SUCH DEEP COUNSEL
WHEELING ROUND
IT WARBLED AND DID SAY AS ARE MY NOTES
TO THEE WHO UNDERSTAND'ST THEM NOT SUCH IS
TH' ETERNAL JUDGMENT UNTO MORTAL KEN
THEN STILL ABIDING IN THAT ENSIGN RANG'D
WHEREWITH THE ROMANS OVER AWED THE WORLD
THOSE BURNING SPLENDOURS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
TOOK UP THE STRAIN AND THUS IT SPAKE AGAIN
NONE EVER HATH ASCENDED TO THIS REALM
WHO HATH NOT A BELIEVER BEEN IN CHRIST
EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE BLEST LIMBS
WERE NAIL'D UPON THE WOOD
BUT LO OF THOSE
WHO CALL 'CHRIST CHRIST THERE SHALL BE MANY FOUND
IN JUDGMENT FURTHER OFF FROM HIM BY FAR
THAN SUCH TO WHOM HIS NAME WAS NEVER KNOWN
CHRISTIANS LIKE THESE THE ETHIOP SHALL CONDEMN
WHEN THAT THE TWO ASSEMBLAGES SHALL PART
ONE RICH ETERNALLY THE OTHER POOR
WHAT MAY THE PERSIANS SAY UNTO YOUR KINGS
WHEN THEY SHALL SEE THAT VOLUME IN THE WHICH
ALL THEIR DISPRAISE IS WRITTEN SPREAD TO VIEW
THERE AMIDST ALBERT'S WORKS SHALL THAT BE READ
WHICH WILL GIVE SPEEDY MOTION TO THE PEN
WHEN PRAGUE SHALL MOURN HER DESOLATED REALM
THERE SHALL BE READ THE WOE THAT HE DOTH WORK
WITH HIS ADULTERATE MONEY ON THE SEINE
WHO BY THE TUSK WILL PERISH THERE BE READ
THE THIRSTING PRIDE THAT MAKETH FOOL ALIKE
THE ENGLISH AND SCOT IMPATIENT OF THEIR BOUND
THERE SHALL BE SEEN THE SPANIARD'S LUXURY
THE DELICATE LIVING THERE OF THE BOHEMIAN
WHO STILL TO WORTH HAS BEEN A WILLING STRANGER
THE HALTER OF JERUSALEM SHALL SEE
A UNIT FOR HIS VIRTUE FOR HIS VICES
NO LESS A MARK THAN MILLION
HE WHO GUARDS
THE ISLE OF FIRE BY OLD ANCHISES HONOUR'D
SHALL FIND HIS AVARICE THERE AND COWARDICE
AND BETTER TO DENOTE HIS LITTLENESS
THE WRITING MUST BE LETTERS MAIM'D THAT SPEAK
MUCH IN A NARROW SPACE
ALL THERE SHALL KNOW
HIS UNCLE AND HIS BROTHER'S FILTHY DOINGS
WHO SO RENOWN'D A NATION AND TWO CROWNS
HAVE BASTARDIZED
AND THEY OF PORTUGAL
AND NORWAY THERE SHALL BE EXPOS'D WITH HIM
OF RATZA WHO HATH COUNTERFEITED ILL
THE COIN OF VENICE
O BLEST HUNGARY
IF THOU NO LONGER PATIENTLY ABID'ST
THY ILL ENTREATING AND O BLEST NAVARRE
IF WITH THY MOUNTAINOUS GIRDLE THOU WOULDST ARM THEE
IN EARNEST OF THAT DAY E'EN NOW ARE HEARD
WAILINGS AND GROANS IN FAMAGOSTA'S STREETS
AND NICOSIA'S GRUDGING AT THEIR BEAST
WHO KEEPETH EVEN FOOTING WITH THE REST
CANTO XX
WHEN DISAPPEARING FROM OUR HEMISPHERE
THE WORLD'S ENLIGHTENER VANISHES AND DAY
ON ALL SIDES WASTETH SUDDENLY THE SKY
EREWHILE IRRADIATE ONLY WITH HIS BEAM
IS YET AGAIN UNFOLDED PUTTING FORTH
INNUMERABLE LIGHTS WHEREIN ONE SHINES
OF SUCH VICISSITUDE IN HEAVEN I THOUGHT
AS THE GREAT SIGN THAT MARSHALETH THE WORLD
AND THE WORLD'S LEADERS IN THE BLESSED BEAK
WAS SILENT FOR THAT ALL THOSE LIVING LIGHTS
WAXING IN SPLENDOUR BURST FORTH INTO SONGS
SUCH AS FROM MEMORY GLIDE AND FALL AWAY
SWEET LOVE THAT DOST APPAREL THEE IN SMILES
HOW LUSTROUS WAS THY SEMBLANCE IN THOSE SPARKLES
WHICH MERELY ARE FROM HOLY THOUGHTS INSPIR'D
AFTER THE PRECIOUS AND BRIGHT BEAMING STONES
THAT DID INGEM THE SIXTH LIGHT CEAS'D THE CHIMING
OF THEIR ANGELIC BELLS METHOUGHT I HEARD
THE MURMURING OF A RIVER THAT DOTH FALL
FROM ROCK TO ROCK TRANSPICUOUS MAKING KNOWN
THE RICHNESS OF HIS SPRING HEAD AND AS SOUND
OF CISTERN AT THE FRET BOARD OR OF PIPE
IS AT THE WIND HOLE MODULATE AND TUN'D
THUS UP THE NECK AS IT WERE HOLLOW ROSE
THAT MURMURING OF THE EAGLE AND FORTHWITH
VOICE THERE ASSUM'D AND THENCE ALONG THE BEAK
ISSUED IN FORM OF WORDS SUCH AS MY HEART
DID LOOK FOR ON WHOSE TABLES I INSCRIB'D THEM
THE PART IN ME THAT SEES AND BEARS THE SUN
IN MORTAL EAGLES IT BEGAN MUST NOW
BE NOTED STEADFASTLY FOR OF THE FIRES
THAT FIGURE ME THOSE GLITTERING IN MINE EYE
ARE CHIEF OF ALL THE GREATEST
THIS THAT SHINES
MIDMOST FOR PUPIL WAS THE SAME WHO SANG
THE HOLY SPIRIT'S SONG AND BARE ABOUT
THE ARK FROM TOWN TO TOWN NOW DOTH HE KNOW
THE MERIT OF HIS SOUL IMPASSION'D STRAINS
BY THEIR WELL FITTED GUERDON
OF THE FIVE
THAT MAKE THE CIRCLE OF THE VISION HE
WHO TO THE BEAK IS NEAREST COMFORTED
THE WIDOW FOR HER SON NOW DOTH HE KNOW
HOW DEAR HE COSTETH NOT TO FOLLOW CHRIST
BOTH FROM EXPERIENCE OF THIS PLEASANT LIFE
AND OF ITS OPPOSITE
HE NEXT WHO FOLLOWS
IN THE CIRCUMFERENCE FOR THE OVER ARCH
BY TRUE REPENTING SLACK'D THE PACE OF DEATH
NOW KNOWETH HE THAT THE DEGREES OF HEAV'N
ALTER NOT WHEN THROUGH PIOUS PRAYER BELOW
TODAY'S IS MADE TOMORROW'S DESTINY
THE OTHER FOLLOWING WITH THE LAWS AND ME
TO YIELD THE SHEPHERD ROOM PASS'D O'ER TO GREECE
FROM GOOD INTENT PRODUCING EVIL FRUIT
NOW KNOWETH HE HOW ALL THE ILL DERIV'D
FROM HIS WELL DOING DOTH NOT HELM HIM AUGHT
THOUGH IT HAVE BROUGHT DESTRUCTION ON THE WORLD
THAT WHICH THOU SEEST IN THE UNDER BOW
WAS WILLIAM WHOM THAT LAND BEWAILS WHICH WEEPS
FOR CHARLES AND FREDERICK LIVING NOW HE KNOWS
HOW WELL IS LOV'D IN HEAV'N THE RIGHTEOUS KING
WHICH HE BETOKENS BY HIS RADIANT SEEMING
WHO IN THE ERRING WORLD BENEATH WOULD DEEM
THAT TROJAN RIPHEUS IN THIS ROUND WAS SET
FIFTH OF THE SAINTLY SPLENDOURS NOW HE KNOWS
ENOUGH OF THAT WHICH THE WORLD CANNOT SEE
THE GRACE DIVINE ALBEIT E'EN HIS SIGHT
REACH NOT ITS UTMOST DEPTH LIKE TO THE LARK
THAT WARBLING IN THE AIR EXPATIATES LONG
THEN TRILLING OUT HIS LAST SWEET MELODY
DROPS SATIATE WITH THE SWEETNESS SUCH APPEAR'D
THAT IMAGE STAMPT BY THE' EVERLASTING PLEASURE
WHICH FASHIONS LIKE ITSELF ALL LOVELY THINGS
I THOUGH MY DOUBTING WERE AS MANIFEST
AS IS THROUGH GLASS THE HUE THAT MANTLES IT
IN SILENCE WAITED NOT FOR TO MY LIPS
WHAT THINGS ARE THESE INVOLUNTARY RUSH'D
AND FORC'D A PASSAGE OUT WHEREAT I MARK'D
A SUDDEN LIGHTENING AND NEW REVELRY
THE EYE WAS KINDLED AND THE BLESSED SIGN
NO MORE TO KEEP ME WOND'RING AND SUSPENSE
REPLIED I SEE THAT THOU BELIEV'ST THESE THINGS
BECAUSE I TELL THEM BUT DISCERN'ST NOT HOW
SO THAT THY KNOWLEDGE WAITS NOT ON THY FAITH
AS ONE WHO KNOWS THE NAME OF THING BY ROTE
BUT IS A STRANGER TO ITS PROPERTIES
TILL OTHER'S TONGUE REVEAL THEM
FERVENT LOVE
AND LIVELY HOPE WITH VIOLENCE ASSAIL
THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS AND OVERCOME
THE WILL OF THE MOST HIGH NOT IN SUCH SORT
AS MAN PREVAILS O'ER MAN BUT CONQUERS IT
BECAUSE 'T IS WILLING TO BE CONQUER'D STILL
THOUGH CONQUER'D BY ITS MERCY CONQUERING
THOSE IN THE EYE WHO LIVE THE FIRST AND FIFTH
CAUSE THEE TO MARVEL IN THAT THOU BEHOLD'ST
THE REGION OF THE ANGELS DECK'D WITH THEM
THEY QUITTED NOT THEIR BODIES AS THOU DEEM'ST
GENTILES BUT CHRISTIANS IN FIRM ROOTED FAITH
THIS OF THE FEET IN FUTURE TO BE PIERC'D
THAT OF FEET NAIL'D ALREADY TO THE CROSS
ONE FROM THE BARRIER OF THE DARK ABYSS
WHERE NEVER ANY WITH GOOD WILL RETURNS
CAME BACK UNTO HIS BONES
OF LIVELY HOPE
SUCH WAS THE MEED OF LIVELY HOPE THAT WING'D
THE PRAYERS SENT UP TO GOD FOR HIS RELEASE
AND PUT POWER INTO THEM TO BEND HIS WILL
THE GLORIOUS SPIRIT OF WHOM I SPEAK TO THEE
A LITTLE WHILE RETURNING TO THE FLESH
BELIEV'D IN HIM WHO HAD THE MEANS TO HELP
AND IN BELIEVING NOURISH'D SUCH A FLAME
OF HOLY LOVE THAT AT THE SECOND DEATH
HE WAS MADE SHARER IN OUR GAMESOME MIRTH
THE OTHER THROUGH THE RICHES OF THAT GRACE
WHICH FROM SO DEEP A FOUNTAIN DOTH DISTIL
AS NEVER EYE CREATED SAW ITS RISING
PLAC'D ALL HIS LOVE BELOW ON JUST AND RIGHT
WHEREFORE OF GRACE GOD OP'D IN HIM THE EYE
TO THE REDEMPTION OF MANKIND TO COME
WHEREIN BELIEVING HE ENDUR'D NO MORE
THE FILTH OF PAGANISM AND FOR THEIR WAYS
REBUK'D THE STUBBORN NATIONS
THE THREE NYMPHS
WHOM AT THE RIGHT WHEEL THOU BEHELDST ADVANCING
WERE SPONSORS FOR HIM MORE THAN THOUSAND YEARS
BEFORE BAPTIZING
O HOW FAR REMOV'D
PREDESTINATION IS THY ROOT FROM SUCH
AS SEE NOT THE FIRST CAUSE ENTIRE AND YE
O MORTAL MEN BE WARY HOW YE JUDGE
FOR WE WHO SEE OUR MAKER KNOW NOT YET
THE NUMBER OF THE CHOSEN AND ESTEEM
SUCH SCANTINESS OF KNOWLEDGE OUR DELIGHT
FOR ALL OUR GOOD IS IN THAT PRIMAL GOOD
CONCENTRATE AND GOD'S WILL AND OURS ARE ONE
SO BY THAT FORM DIVINE WAS GIV'N TO ME
SWEET MEDICINE TO CLEAR AND STRENGTHEN SIGHT
AND AS ONE HANDLING SKILLFULLY THE HARP
ATTENDANT ON SOME SKILFUL SONGSTER'S VOICE
BIDS THE CHORDS VIBRATE AND THEREIN THE SONG
ACQUIRES MORE PLEASURE SO THE WHILST IT SPAKE
IT DOTH REMEMBER ME THAT I BEHELD
THE PAIR OF BLESSED LUMINARIES MOVE
LIKE THE ACCORDANT TWINKLING OF TWO EYES
THEIR BEAMY CIRCLETS DANCING TO THE SOUNDS
CANTO XXI
AGAIN MINE EYES WERE FIX'D ON BEATRICE
AND WITH MINE EYES MY SOUL THAT IN HER LOOKS
FOUND ALL CONTENTMENT
YET NO SMILE SHE WORE
AND DID I SMILE QUOTH SHE THOU WOULDST BE STRAIGHT
LIKE SEMELE WHEN INTO ASHES TURN'D
FOR MOUNTING THESE ETERNAL PALACE STAIRS
MY BEAUTY WHICH THE LOFTIER IT CLIMBS
AS THOU HAST NOTED STILL DOTH KINDLE MORE
SO SHINES THAT WERE NO TEMP'RING INTERPOS'D
THY MORTAL PUISSANCE WOULD FROM ITS RAYS
SHRINK AS THE LEAF DOTH FROM THE THUNDERBOLT
INTO THE SEVENTH SPLENDOUR ARE WE WAFTED
THAT UNDERNEATH THE BURNING LION'S BREAST
BEAMS IN THIS HOUR COMMINGLED WITH HIS MIGHT
THY MIND BE WITH THINE EYES AND IN THEM MIRROR'D
THE SHAPE WHICH IN THIS MIRROR SHALL BE SHOWN
WHOSO CAN DEEM HOW FONDLY I HAD FED
MY SIGHT UPON HER BLISSFUL COUNTENANCE
MAY KNOW WHEN TO NEW THOUGHTS I CHANG'D WHAT JOY
TO DO THE BIDDING OF MY HEAV'NLY GUIDE
IN EQUAL BALANCE POISING EITHER WEIGHT
WITHIN THE CRYSTAL WHICH RECORDS THE NAME
AS ITS REMOTER CIRCLE GIRDS THE WORLD
OF THAT LOV'D MONARCH IN WHOSE HAPPY REIGN
NO ILL HAD POWER TO HARM I SAW REAR'D UP
IN COLOUR LIKE TO SUN ILLUMIN'D GOLD
A LADDER WHICH MY KEN PURSUED IN VAIN
SO LOFTY WAS THE SUMMIT DOWN WHOSE STEPS
I SAW THE SPLENDOURS IN SUCH MULTITUDE
DESCENDING EV'RY LIGHT IN HEAV'N METHOUGHT
WAS SHED THENCE
AS THE ROOKS AT DAWN OF DAY
BESTIRRING THEM TO DRY THEIR FEATHERS CHILL
SOME SPEED THEIR WAY A FIELD AND HOMEWARD SOME
RETURNING CROSS THEIR FLIGHT WHILE SOME ABIDE
AND WHEEL AROUND THEIR AIRY LODGE SO SEEM'D
THAT GLITTERANCE WAFTED ON ALTERNATE WING
AS UPON CERTAIN STAIR IT MET AND CLASH'D
ITS SHINING
AND ONE LING'RING NEAR US WAX'D
SO BRIGHT THAT IN MY THOUGHT SAID THE LOVE
WHICH THIS BETOKENS ME ADMITS NO DOUBT
UNWILLINGLY FROM QUESTION I REFRAIN
TO HER BY WHOM MY SILENCE AND MY SPEECH
ARE ORDER'D LOOKING FOR A SIGN WHENCE SHE
WHO IN THE SIGHT OF HIM THAT SEETH ALL
SAW WHEREFORE I WAS SILENT PROMPTED ME
T' INDULGE THE FERVENT WISH AND I BEGAN
I AM NOT WORTHY OF MY OWN DESERT
THAT THOU SHOULDST ANSWER ME BUT FOR HER SAKE
WHO HATH VOUCHSAF'D MY ASKING SPIRIT BLEST
THAT IN THY JOY ART SHROUDED SAY THE CAUSE
WHICH BRINGETH THEE SO NEAR AND WHEREFORE SAY
DOTH THE SWEET SYMPHONY OF PARADISE
KEEP SILENCE HERE PERVADING WITH SUCH SOUNDS
OF RAPT DEVOTION EV'RY LOWER SPHERE
MORTAL ART THOU IN HEARING AS IN SIGHT
WAS THE REPLY AND WHAT FORBADE THE SMILE
OF BEATRICE INTERRUPTS OUR SONG
ONLY TO YIELD THEE GLADNESS OF MY VOICE
AND OF THE LIGHT THAT VESTS ME I THUS FAR
DESCEND THESE HALLOW'D STEPS NOT THAT MORE LOVE
INVITES ME FOR LO THERE ALOFT AS MUCH
OR MORE OF LOVE IS WITNESS'D IN THOSE FLAMES
BUT SUCH MY LOT BY CHARITY ASSIGN'D
THAT MAKES US READY SERVANTS AS THOU SEEST
TO EXECUTE THE COUNSEL OF THE HIGHEST
THAT IN THIS COURT SAID I O SACRED LAMP
LOVE NO COMPULSION NEEDS BUT FOLLOWS FREE
TH' ETERNAL PROVIDENCE I WELL DISCERN
THIS HARDER FIND TO DEEM WHY OF THY PEERS
THOU ONLY TO THIS OFFICE WERT FOREDOOM'D
I HAD NOT ENDED WHEN LIKE RAPID MILL
UPON ITS CENTRE WHIRL'D THE LIGHT AND THEN
THE LOVE THAT DID INHABIT THERE REPLIED
SPLENDOUR ETERNAL PIERCING THROUGH THESE FOLDS
ITS VIRTUE TO MY VISION KNITS AND THUS
SUPPORTED LIFTS ME SO ABOVE MYSELF
THAT ON THE SOV'RAN ESSENCE WHICH IT WELLS FROM
I HAVE THE POWER TO GAZE AND HENCE THE JOY
WHEREWITH I SPARKLE EQUALING WITH MY BLAZE
THE KEENNESS OF MY SIGHT
BUT NOT THE SOUL
THAT IS IN HEAV'N MOST LUSTROUS NOR THE SERAPH
THAT HATH HIS EYES MOST FIX'D ON GOD SHALL SOLVE
WHAT THOU HAST ASK'D FOR IN TH' ABYSS IT LIES
OF TH' EVERLASTING STATUTE SUNK SO LOW
THAT NO CREATED KEN MAY FATHOM IT
AND TO THE MORTAL WORLD WHEN THOU RETURN'ST
BE THIS REPORTED THAT NONE HENCEFORTH DARE
DIRECT HIS FOOTSTEPS TO SO DREAD A BOURN
THE MIND THAT HERE IS RADIANT ON THE EARTH
IS WRAPT IN MIST
LOOK THEN IF SHE MAY DO
BELOW WHAT PASSETH HER ABILITY
WHEN SHE IS TA'EN TO HEAV'N BY WORDS LIKE THESE
ADMONISH'D I THE QUESTION URG'D NO MORE
AND OF THE SPIRIT HUMBLY SUED ALONE
T' INSTRUCT ME OF ITS STATE
'TWIXT EITHER SHORE
OF ITALY NOR DISTANT FROM THY LAND
A STONY RIDGE ARISETH IN SUCH SORT
THE THUNDER DOTH NOT LIFT HIS VOICE SO HIGH
THEY CALL IT CATRIA AT WHOSE FOOT A CELL
IS SACRED TO THE LONELY EREMITE
FOR WORSHIP SET APART AND HOLY RITES
A THIRD TIME THUS IT SPAKE THEN ADDED THERE
SO FIRMLY TO GOD'S SERVICE I ADHER'D
THAT WITH NO COSTLIER VIANDS THAN THE JUICE
OF OLIVES EASILY I PASS'D THE HEATS
OF SUMMER AND THE WINTER FROSTS CONTENT
IN HEAV'N WARD MUSINGS
RICH WERE THE RETURNS
AND FERTILE WHICH THAT CLOISTER ONCE WAS US'D
TO RENDER TO THESE HEAVENS NOW 'T IS FALL'N
INTO A WASTE SO EMPTY THAT ERE LONG
DETECTION MUST LAY BARE ITS VANITY
PIETRO DAMIANO THERE WAS I YCLEPT
PIETRO THE SINNER WHEN BEFORE I DWELT
BESIDE THE ADRIATIC IN THE HOUSE
OF OUR BLEST LADY
NEAR UPON MY CLOSE
OF MORTAL LIFE THROUGH MUCH IMPORTUNING
I WAS CONSTRAIN'D TO WEAR THE HAT THAT STILL
FROM BAD TO WORSE IT SHIFTED CEPHAS CAME
HE CAME WHO WAS THE HOLY SPIRIT'S VESSEL
BAREFOOT AND LEAN EATING THEIR BREAD AS CHANC'D
AT THE FIRST TABLE
MODERN SHEPHERD'S NEED
THOSE WHO ON EITHER HAND MAY PROP AND LEAD THEM
SO BURLY ARE THEY GROWN AND FROM BEHIND
OTHERS TO HOIST THEM
DOWN THE PALFREY'S SIDES
SPREAD THEIR BROAD MANTLES SO AS BOTH THE BEASTS
ARE COVER'D WITH ONE SKIN
O PATIENCE THOU
THAT LOOKST ON THIS AND DOTH ENDURE SO LONG
I AT THOSE ACCENTS SAW THE SPLENDOURS DOWN
FROM STEP TO STEP ALIGHT AND WHEEL AND WAX
EACH CIRCUITING MORE BEAUTIFUL
ROUND THIS
THEY CAME AND STAY'D THEM UTTERED THEM A SHOUT
SO LOUD IT HATH NO LIKENESS HERE NOR I
WIST WHAT IT SPAKE SO DEAF'NING WAS THE THUNDER
CANTO XXII
ASTOUNDED TO THE GUARDIAN OF MY STEPS
I TURN'D ME LIKE THE CHILL WHO ALWAYS RUNS
THITHER FOR SUCCOUR WHERE HE TRUSTETH MOST
AND SHE WAS LIKE THE MOTHER WHO HER SON
BEHOLDING PALE AND BREATHLESS WITH HER VOICE
SOOTHES HIM AND HE IS CHEER'D FOR THUS SHE SPAKE
SOOTHING ME KNOW'ST NOT THOU THOU ART IN HEAV'N
AND KNOW'ST NOT THOU WHATEVER IS IN HEAV'N
IS HOLY AND THAT NOTHING THERE IS DONE
BUT IS DONE ZEALOUSLY AND WELL DEEM NOW
WHAT CHANGE IN THEE THE SONG AND WHAT MY SMILE
HAD WROUGHT SINCE THUS THE SHOUT HAD POW'R TO MOVE THEE
IN WHICH COULDST THOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD THEIR PRAYERS
THE VENGEANCE WERE ALREADY KNOWN TO THEE
WHICH THOU MUST WITNESS ERE THY MORTAL HOUR
THE SWORD OF HEAV'N IS NOT IN HASTE TO SMITE
NOR YET DOTH LINGER SAVE UNTO HIS SEEMING
WHO IN DESIRE OR FEAR DOTH LOOK FOR IT
BUT ELSEWHERE NOW L BID THEE TURN THY VIEW
SO SHALT THOU MANY A FAMOUS SPIRIT BEHOLD
MINE EYES DIRECTING AS SHE WILL'D I SAW
A HUNDRED LITTLE SPHERES THAT FAIRER GREW
BY INTERCHANGE OF SPLENDOUR
I REMAIN'D
AS ONE WHO FEARFUL OF O'ER MUCH PRESUMING
ABATES IN HIM THE KEENNESS OF DESIRE
NOR DARES TO QUESTION WHEN AMID THOSE PEARLS
ONE LARGEST AND MOST LUSTROUS ONWARD DREW
THAT IT MIGHT YIELD CONTENTMENT TO MY WISH
AND FROM WITHIN IT THESE THE SOUNDS I HEARD
IF THOU LIKE ME BEHELDST THE CHARITY
THAT BURNS AMONGST US WHAT THY MIND CONCEIVES
WERE UTTER'D
BUT THAT ERE THE LOFTY BOUND
THOU REACH EXPECTANCE MAY NOT WEARY THEE
I WILL MAKE ANSWER EVEN TO THE THOUGHT
WHICH THOU HAST SUCH RESPECT OF
IN OLD DAYS
THAT MOUNTAIN AT WHOSE SIDE CASSINO RESTS
WAS ON ITS HEIGHT FREQUENTED BY A RACE
DECEIVED AND ILL DISPOS'D AND I IT WAS
WHO THITHER CARRIED FIRST THE NAME OF HIM
WHO BROUGHT THE SOUL SUBLIMING TRUTH TO MAN
AND SUCH A SPEEDING GRACE SHONE OVER ME
THAT FROM THEIR IMPIOUS WORSHIP I RECLAIM'D
THE DWELLERS ROUND ABOUT WHO WITH THE WORLD
WERE IN DELUSION LOST
THESE OTHER FLAMES
THE SPIRITS OF MEN CONTEMPLATIVE WERE ALL
ENLIVEN'D BY THAT WARMTH WHOSE KINDLY FORCE
GIVES BIRTH TO FLOWERS AND FRUITS OF HOLINESS
HERE IS MACARIUS ROMOALDO HERE
AND HERE MY BRETHREN WHO THEIR STEPS REFRAIN'D
WITHIN THE CLOISTERS AND HELD FIRM THEIR HEART
I ANSW'RING THUS THY GENTLE WORDS AND KIND
AND THIS THE CHEERFUL SEMBLANCE I BEHOLD
NOT UNOBSERVANT BEAMING IN YE ALL
HAVE RAIS'D ASSURANCE IN ME WAKENING IT
FULL BLOSSOM'D IN MY BOSOM AS A ROSE
BEFORE THE SUN WHEN THE CONSUMMATE FLOWER
HAS SPREAD TO UTMOST AMPLITUDE
OF THEE
THEREFORE ENTREAT I FATHER TO DECLARE
IF I MAY GAIN SUCH FAVOUR AS TO GAZE
UPON THINE IMAGE BY NO COVERING VEIL'D
BROTHER HE THUS REJOIN'D IN THE LAST SPHERE
EXPECT COMPLETION OF THY LOFTY AIM
FOR THERE ON EACH DESIRE COMPLETION WAITS
AND THERE ON MINE WHERE EVERY AIM IS FOUND
PERFECT ENTIRE AND FOR FULFILLMENT RIPE
THERE ALL THINGS ARE AS THEY HAVE EVER BEEN
FOR SPACE IS NONE TO BOUND NOR POLE DIVIDES
OUR LADDER REACHES EVEN TO THAT CLIME
AND SO AT GIDDY DISTANCE MOCKS THY VIEW
THITHER THE PATRIARCH JACOB SAW IT STRETCH
ITS TOPMOST ROUND WHEN IT APPEAR'D TO HIM
WITH ANGELS LADEN
BUT TO MOUNT IT NOW
NONE LIFTS HIS FOOT FROM EARTH AND HENCE MY RULE
IS LEFT A PROFITLESS STAIN UPON THE LEAVES
THE WALLS FOR ABBEY REAR'D TURNED INTO DENS
THE COWLS TO SACKS CHOAK'D UP WITH MUSTY MEAL
FOUL USURY DOTH NOT MORE LIFT ITSELF
AGAINST GOD'S PLEASURE THAN THAT FRUIT WHICH MAKES
THE HEARTS OF MONKS SO WANTON FOR WHATE'ER
IS IN THE CHURCH'S KEEPING ALL PERTAINS
TO SUCH AS SUE FOR HEAV'N'S SWEET SAKE AND NOT
TO THOSE WHO IN RESPECT OF KINDRED CLAIM
OR ON MORE VILE ALLOWANCE
MORTAL FLESH
IS GROWN SO DAINTY GOOD BEGINNINGS LAST NOT
FROM THE OAK'S BIRTH UNTO THE ACORN'S SETTING
HIS CONVENT PETER FOUNDED WITHOUT GOLD
OR SILVER I WITH PRAY'RS AND FASTING MINE
AND FRANCIS HIS IN MEEK HUMILITY
AND IF THOU NOTE THE POINT WHENCE EACH PROCEEDS
THEN LOOK WHAT IT HATH ERR'D TO THOU SHALT FIND
THE WHITE GROWN MURKY
JORDAN WAS TURN'D BACK
AND A LESS WONDER THEN THE REFLUENT SEA
MAY AT GOD'S PLEASURE WORK AMENDMENT HERE
SO SAYING TO HIS ASSEMBLY BACK HE DREW
AND THEY TOGETHER CLUSTER'D INTO ONE
THEN ALL ROLL'D UPWARD LIKE AN EDDYING WIND
THE SWEET DAME BECKON'D ME TO FOLLOW THEM
AND BY THAT INFLUENCE ONLY SO PREVAIL'D
OVER MY NATURE THAT NO NATURAL MOTION
ASCENDING OR DESCENDING HERE BELOW
HAD AS I MOUNTED WITH MY PENNON VIED
SO READER AS MY HOPE IS TO RETURN
UNTO THE HOLY TRIUMPH FOR THE WHICH
I OFTTIMES WAIL MY SINS AND SMITE MY BREAST
THOU HADST BEEN LONGER DRAWING OUT AND THRUSTING
THY FINGER IN THE FIRE THAN I WAS ERE
THE SIGN THAT FOLLOWETH TAURUS I BEHELD
AND ENTER'D ITS PRECINCT
O GLORIOUS STARS
O LIGHT IMPREGNATE WITH EXCEEDING VIRTUE
TO WHOM WHATE'ER OF GENIUS LIFTETH ME
ABOVE THE VULGAR GRATEFUL I REFER
WITH YE THE PARENT OF ALL MORTAL LIFE
AROSE AND SET WHEN I DID FIRST INHALE
THE TUSCAN AIR AND AFTERWARD WHEN GRACE
VOUCHSAF'D ME ENTRANCE TO THE LOFTY WHEEL
THAT IN ITS ORB IMPELS YE FATE DECREED
MY PASSAGE AT YOUR CLIME
TO YOU MY SOUL
DEVOUTLY SIGHS FOR VIRTUE EVEN NOW
TO MEET THE HARD EMPRIZE THAT DRAWS ME ON
THOU ART SO NEAR THE SUM OF BLESSEDNESS
SAID BEATRICE THAT BEHOOVES THY KEN
BE VIGILANT AND CLEAR
AND TO THIS END
OR EVEN THOU ADVANCE THEE FURTHER HENCE
LOOK DOWNWARD AND CONTEMPLATE WHAT A WORLD
ALREADY STRETCHED UNDER OUR FEET THERE LIES
SO AS THY HEART MAY IN ITS BLITHEST MOOD
PRESENT ITSELF TO THE TRIUMPHAL THRONG
WHICH THROUGH THE' ETHERIAL CONCAVE COMES REJOICING
I STRAIGHT OBEY'D AND WITH MINE EYE RETURN'D
THROUGH ALL THE SEVEN SPHERES AND SAW THIS GLOBE
SO PITIFUL OF SEMBLANCE THAT PERFORCE
IT MOVED MY SMILES AND HIM IN TRUTH I HOLD
FOR WISEST WHO ESTEEMS IT LEAST WHOSE THOUGHTS
ELSEWHERE ARE FIX'D HIM WORTHIEST CALL AND BEST
I SAW THE DAUGHTER OF LATONA SHINE
WITHOUT THE SHADOW WHEREOF LATE I DEEM'D
THAT DENSE AND RARE WERE CAUSE
HERE I SUSTAIN'D
THE VISAGE HYPERION OF THY SUN
AND MARK'D HOW NEAR HIM WITH THEIR CIRCLE ROUND
MOVE MAIA AND DIONE HERE DISCERN'D
JOVE'S TEMPERING 'TWIXT HIS SIRE AND SON AND HENCE
THEIR CHANGES AND THEIR VARIOUS ASPECTS
DISTINCTLY SCANN'D
NOR MIGHT I NOT DESCRY
OF ALL THE SEVEN HOW BULKY EACH HOW SWIFT
NOR OF THEIR SEVERAL DISTANCES NOT LEARN
THIS PETTY AREA O'ER THE WHICH WE STRIDE
SO FIERCELY AS ALONG THE ETERNAL TWINS
I WOUND MY WAY APPEAR'D BEFORE ME ALL
FORTH FROM THE HAVENS STRETCH'D UNTO THE HILLS
THEN TO THE BEAUTEOUS EYES MINE EYES RETURN'D
CANTO XXIII
E'EN AS THE BIRD WHO MIDST THE LEAFY BOWER
HAS IN HER NEST SAT DARKLING THROUGH THE NIGHT
WITH HER SWEET BROOD IMPATIENT TO DESCRY
THEIR WISHED LOOKS AND TO BRING HOME THEIR FOOD
IN THE FOND QUEST UNCONSCIOUS OF HER TOIL
SHE OF THE TIME PREVENIENT ON THE SPRAY
THAT OVERHANGS THEIR COUCH WITH WAKEFUL GAZE
EXPECTS THE SUN NOR EVER TILL THE DAWN
REMOVETH FROM THE EAST HER EAGER KEN
SO STOOD THE DAME ERECT AND BENT HER GLANCE
WISTFULLY ON THAT REGION WHERE THE SUN
ABATETH MOST HIS SPEED THAT SEEING HER
SUSPENSE AND WAND'RING I BECAME AS ONE
IN WHOM DESIRE IS WAKEN'D AND THE HOPE
OF SOMEWHAT NEW TO COME FILLS WITH DELIGHT
SHORT SPACE ENSUED I WAS NOT HELD I SAY
LONG IN EXPECTANCE WHEN I SAW THE HEAV'N
WAX MORE AND MORE RESPLENDENT AND BEHOLD
CRIED BEATRICE THE TRIUMPHAL HOSTS
OF CHRIST AND ALL THE HARVEST REAP'D AT LENGTH
OF THY ASCENDING UP THESE SPHERES MESEEM'D
THAT WHILE SHE SPAKE HER IMAGE ALL DID BURN
AND IN HER EYES SUCH FULLNESS WAS OF JOY
AND I AM FAIN TO PASS UNCONSTRUED BY
AS IN THE CALM FULL MOON WHEN TRIVIA SMILES
IN PEERLESS BEAUTY 'MID TH' ETERNAL NYMPUS
THAT PAINT THROUGH ALL ITS GULFS THE BLUE PROFOUND
IN BRIGHT PRE EMINENCE SO SAW I THERE
O'ER MILLION LAMPS A SUN FROM WHOM ALL DREW
THEIR RADIANCE AS FROM OURS THE STARRY TRAIN
AND THROUGH THE LIVING LIGHT SO LUSTROUS GLOW'D
THE SUBSTANCE THAT MY KEN ENDUR'D IT NOT
O BEATRICE SWEET AND PRECIOUS GUIDE
WHO CHEER'D ME WITH HER COMFORTABLE WORDS
AGAINST THE VIRTUE THAT O'ERPOW'RETH THEE
AVAILS NOT TO RESIST
HERE IS THE MIGHT
AND HERE THE WISDOM WHICH DID OPEN LAY
THE PATH THAT HAD BEEN YEARNED FOR SO LONG
BETWIXT THE HEAV'N AND EARTH LIKE TO THE FIRE
THAT IN A CLOUD IMPRISON'D DOTH BREAK OUT
EXPANSIVE SO THAT FROM ITS WOMB ENLARG'D
IT FALLETH AGAINST NATURE TO THE GROUND
THUS IN THAT HEAV'NLY BANQUETING MY SOUL
OUTGREW HERSELF AND IN THE TRANSPORT LOST
HOLDS NOW REMEMBRANCE NONE OF WHAT SHE WAS
OPE THOU THINE EYES AND MARK ME THOU HAST SEEN
THINGS THAT EMPOWER THEE TO SUSTAIN MY SMILE
I WAS AS ONE WHEN A FORGOTTEN DREAM
DOTH COME ACROSS HIM AND HE STRIVES IN VAIN
TO SHAPE IT IN HIS FANTASY AGAIN
WHENAS THAT GRACIOUS BOON WAS PROFFER'D ME
WHICH NEVER MAY BE CANCEL'D FROM THE BOOK
WHEREIN THE PAST IS WRITTEN
NOW WERE ALL
THOSE TONGUES TO SOUND THAT HAVE ON SWEETEST MILK
OF POLYHYMNIA AND HER SISTERS FED
AND FATTEN'D NOT WITH ALL THEIR HELP TO BOOT
UNTO THE THOUSANDTH PARCEL OF THE TRUTH
MY SONG MIGHT SHADOW FORTH THAT SAINTLY SMILE
FLOW MERELY IN HER SAINTLY LOOKS IT WROUGHT
AND WITH SUCH FIGURING OF PARADISE
THE SACRED STRAIN MUST LEAP LIKE ONE THAT MEETS
A SUDDEN INTERRUPTION TO HIS ROAD
BUT HE WHO THINKS HOW PONDEROUS THE THEME
AND THAT 'T IS LAIN UPON A MORTAL SHOULDER
MAY PARDON IF IT TREMBLE WITH THE BURDEN
THE TRACK OUR VENTROUS KEEL MUST FURROW BROOKS
NO UNRIBB'D PINNACE NO SELF SPARING PILOT
WHY DOTH MY FACE SAID BEATRICE THUS
ENAMOUR THEE AS THAT THOU DOST NOT TURN
UNTO THE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN BLOSSOMING
BENEATH THE RAYS OF CHRIST HERE IS THE ROSE
WHEREIN THE WORD DIVINE WAS MADE INCARNATE
AND HERE THE LILIES BY WHOSE ODOUR KNOWN
THE WAY OF LIFE WAS FOLLOW'D PROMPT I HEARD
HER BIDDING AND ENCOUNTER ONCE AGAIN
THE STRIFE OF ACHING VISION
AS EREWHILE
THROUGH GLANCE OF SUNLIGHT STREAM'D THROUGH BROKEN CLOUD
MINE EYES A FLOWER BESPRINKLED MEAD HAVE SEEN
THOUGH VEIL'D THEMSELVES IN SHADE SO SAW I THERE
LEGIONS OF SPLENDOURS ON WHOM BURNING RAYS
SHED LIGHTNINGS FROM ABOVE YET SAW I NOT
THE FOUNTAIN WHENCE THEY FLOW'D
O GRACIOUS VIRTUE
THOU WHOSE BROAD STAMP IS ON THEM HIGHER UP
THOU DIDST EXALT THY GLORY TO GIVE ROOM
TO MY O'ERLABOUR'D SIGHT WHEN AT THE NAME
OF THAT FAIR FLOWER WHOM DULY I INVOKE
BOTH MORN AND EVE MY SOUL WITH ALL HER MIGHT
COLLECTED ON THE GOODLIEST ARDOUR FIX'D
AND AS THE BRIGHT DIMENSIONS OF THE STAR
IN HEAV'N EXCELLING AS ONCE HERE ON EARTH
WERE IN MY EYEBALLS LIVELY PORTRAY'D
LO FROM WITHIN THE SKY A CRESSET FELL
CIRCLING IN FASHION OF A DIADEM
AND GIRT THE STAR AND HOV'RING ROUND IT WHEEL'D
WHATEVER MELODY SOUNDS SWEETEST HERE
AND DRAWS THE SPIRIT MOST UNTO ITSELF
MIGHT SEEM A RENT CLOUD WHEN IT GRATES THE THUNDER
COMPAR'D UNTO THE SOUNDING OF THAT LYRE
WHEREWITH THE GOODLIEST SAPPHIRE THAT INLAYS
THE FLOOR OF HEAV'N WAS CROWN'D
ANGELIC LOVE
I AM WHO THUS WITH HOV'RING FLIGHT ENWHEEL
THE LOFTY RAPTURE FROM THAT WOMB INSPIR'D
WHERE OUR DESIRE DID DWELL AND ROUND THEE SO
LADY OF HEAV'N WILL HOVER LONG AS THOU
THY SON SHALT FOLLOW AND DIVINER JOY
SHALL FROM THY PRESENCE GILD THE HIGHEST SPHERE
SUCH CLOSE WAS TO THE CIRCLING MELODY
AND AS IT ENDED ALL THE OTHER LIGHTS
TOOK UP THE STRAIN AND ECHOED MARY'S NAME
THE ROBE THAT WITH ITS REGAL FOLDS ENWRAPS
THE WORLD AND WITH THE NEARER BREATH OF GOD
DOTH BURN AND QUIVER HELD SO FAR RETIR'D
ITS INNER HEM AND SKIRTING OVER US
THAT YET NO GLIMMER OF ITS MAJESTY
HAD STREAM'D UNTO ME THEREFORE WERE MINE EYES
UNEQUAL TO PURSUE THE CROWNED FLAME
THAT ROSE AND SOUGHT ITS NATAL SEED OF FIRE
AND LIKE TO BABE THAT STRETCHES FORTH ITS ARMS
FOR VERY EAGERNESS TOWARDS THE BREAST
AFTER THE MILK IS TAKEN SO OUTSTRETCH'D
THEIR WAVY SUMMITS ALL THE FERVENT BAND
THROUGH ZEALOUS LOVE TO MARY THEN IN VIEW
THERE HALTED AND REGINA COELI SANG
SO SWEETLY THE DELIGHT HATH LEFT ME NEVER
O WHAT O'ERFLOWING PLENTY IS UP PIL'D
IN THOSE RICH LADEN COFFERS WHICH BELOW
SOW'D THE GOOD SEED WHOSE HARVEST NOW THEY KEEP
HERE ARE THE TREASURES TASTED THAT WITH TEARS
WERE IN THE BABYLONIAN EXILE WON
WHEN GOLD HAD FAIL'D THEM
HERE IN SYNOD HIGH
OF ANCIENT COUNCIL WITH THE NEW CONVEN'D
UNDER THE SON OF MARY AND OF GOD
VICTORIOUS HE HIS MIGHTY TRIUMPH HOLDS
TO WHOM THE KEYS OF GLORY WERE ASSIGN'D
CANTO XXIV
O YE IN CHOSEN FELLOWSHIP ADVANC'D
TO THE GREAT SUPPER OF THE BLESSED LAMB
WHEREON WHO FEEDS HATH EVERY WISH FULFILL'D
IF TO THIS MAN THROUGH GOD'S GRACE BE VOUCHSAF'D
FORETASTE OF THAT WHICH FROM YOUR TABLE FALLS
OR EVER DEATH HIS FATED TERM PRESCRIBE
BE YE NOT HEEDLESS OF HIS URGENT WILL
BUT MAY SOME INFLUENCE OF YOUR SACRED DEWS
SPRINKLE HIM
OF THE FOUNT YE ALWAY DRINK
WHENCE FLOWS WHAT MOST HE CRAVES BEATRICE SPAKE
AND THE REJOICING SPIRITS LIKE TO SPHERES
ON FIRM SET POLES REVOLVING TRAIL'D A BLAZE
OF COMET SPLENDOUR AND AS WHEELS THAT WIND
THEIR CIRCLES IN THE HOROLOGE SO WORK
THE STATED ROUNDS THAT TO TH' OBSERVANT EYE
THE FIRST SEEMS STILL AND AS IT FLEW THE LAST
E'EN THUS THEIR CAROLS WEAVING VARIOUSLY
THEY BY THE MEASURE PAC'D OR SWIFT OR SLOW
MADE ME TO RATE THE RICHES OF THEIR JOY
FROM THAT WHICH I DID NOTE IN BEAUTY MOST
EXCELLING SAW I ISSUE FORTH A FLAME
SO BRIGHT AS NONE WAS LEFT MORE GOODLY THERE
ROUND BEATRICE THRICE IT WHEEL'D ABOUT
WITH SO DIVINE A SONG THAT FANCY'S EAR
RECORDS IT NOT AND THE PEN PASSETH ON
AND LEAVES A BLANK FOR THAT OUR MORTAL SPEECH
NOR E'EN THE INWARD SHAPING OF THE BRAIN
HATH COLOURS FINE ENOUGH TO TRACE SUCH FOLDS
O SAINTLY SISTER MINE THY PRAYER DEVOUT
IS WITH SO VEHEMENT AFFECTION URG'D
THOU DOST UNBIND ME FROM THAT BEAUTEOUS SPHERE
SUCH WERE THE ACCENTS TOWARDS MY LADY BREATH'D
FROM THAT BLEST ARDOUR SOON AS IT WAS STAY'D
TO WHOM SHE THUS O EVERLASTING LIGHT
OF HIM WITHIN WHOSE MIGHTY GRASP OUR LORD
DID LEAVE THE KEYS WHICH OF THIS WONDROUS BLISS
HE BARE BELOW TENT THIS MAN AS THOU WILT
WITH LIGHTER PROBE OR DEEP TOUCHING THE FAITH
BY THE WHICH THOU DIDST ON THE BILLOWS WALK
IF HE IN LOVE IN HOPE AND IN BELIEF
BE STEADFAST IS NOT HID FROM THEE FOR THOU
HAST THERE THY KEN WHERE ALL THINGS ARE BEHELD
IN LIVELIEST PORTRAITURE
BUT SINCE TRUE FAITH
HAS PEOPLED THIS FAIR REALM WITH CITIZENS
MEET IS THAT TO EXALT ITS GLORY MORE
THOU IN HIS AUDIENCE SHOULDST THEREOF DISCOURSE
LIKE TO THE BACHELOR WHO ARMS HIMSELF
AND SPEAKS NOT TILL THE MASTER HAVE PROPOS'D
THE QUESTION TO APPROVE AND NOT TO END IT
SO I IN SILENCE ARM'D ME WHILE SHE SPAKE
SUMMONING UP EACH ARGUMENT TO AID
AS WAS BEHOOVEFUL FOR SUCH QUESTIONER
AND SUCH PROFESSION AS GOOD CHRISTIAN OUGHT
DECLARE THEE WHAT IS FAITH WHEREAT I RAIS'D
MY FOREHEAD TO THE LIGHT WHENCE THIS HAD BREATH'D
THEN TURN'D TO BEATRICE AND IN HER LOOKS
APPROVAL MET THAT FROM THEIR INMOST FOUNT
I SHOULD UNLOCK THE WATERS
MAY THE GRACE
THAT GIVETH ME THE CAPTAIN OF THE CHURCH
FOR CONFESSOR SAID I VOUCHSAFE TO ME
APT UTTERANCE FOR MY THOUGHTS THEN ADDED SIRE
E'EN AS SET DOWN BY THE UNERRING STYLE
OF THY DEAR BROTHER WHO WITH THEE CONSPIR'D
TO BRING ROME IN UNTO THE WAY OF LIFE
FAITH OF THINGS HOP'D IS SUBSTANCE AND THE PROOF
OF THINGS NOT SEEN AND HEREIN DOTH CONSIST
METHINKS ITS ESSENCE RIGHTLY HAST THOU DEEM'D
WAS ANSWER'D IF THOU WELL DISCERN WHY FIRST
HE HATH DEFIN'D IT SUBSTANCE AND THEN PROOF
THE DEEP THINGS I REPLIED WHICH HERE I SCAN
DISTINCTLY ARE BELOW FROM MORTAL EYE
SO HIDDEN THEY HAVE IN BELIEF ALONE
THEIR BEING ON WHICH CREDENCE HOPE SUBLIME
IS BUILT AND THEREFORE SUBSTANCE IT INTENDS
AND INASMUCH AS WE MUST NEEDS INFER
FROM SUCH BELIEF OUR REASONING ALL RESPECT
TO OTHER VIEW EXCLUDED HENCE OF PROOF
TH' INTENTION IS DERIV'D FORTHWITH I HEARD
IF THUS WHATE'ER BY LEARNING MEN ATTAIN
WERE UNDERSTOOD THE SOPHIST WOULD WANT ROOM
TO EXERCISE HIS WIT SO BREATH'D THE FLAME
OF LOVE THEN ADDED CURRENT IS THE COIN
THOU UTTER'ST BOTH IN WEIGHT AND IN ALLOY
BUT TELL ME IF THOU HAST IT IN THY PURSE
EVEN SO GLITTERING AND SO ROUND SAID I
I NOT A WHIT MISDOUBT OF ITS ASSAY
NEXT ISSUED FROM THE DEEP IMBOSOM'D SPLENDOUR
SAY WHENCE THE COSTLY JEWEL ON THE WHICH
IS FOUNDED EVERY VIRTUE CAME TO THEE
THE FLOOD I ANSWER'D FROM THE SPIRIT OF GOD
RAIN'D DOWN UPON THE ANCIENT BOND AND NEW
HERE IS THE REAS'NING THAT CONVINCETH ME
SO FEELINGLY EACH ARGUMENT BESIDE
SEEMS BLUNT AND FORCELESS IN COMPARISON
THEN HEARD I WHEREFORE HOLDEST THOU THAT EACH
THE ELDER PROPOSITION AND THE NEW
WHICH SO PERSUADE THEE ARE THE VOICE OF HEAV'N
THE WORKS THAT FOLLOW'D EVIDENCE THEIR TRUTH
I ANSWER'D NATURE DID NOT MAKE FOR THESE
THE IRON HOT OR ON HER ANVIL MOULD THEM
WHO VOUCHETH TO THEE OF THE WORKS THEMSELVES
WAS THE REPLY THAT THEY IN VERY DEED
ARE THAT THEY PURPORT NONE HATH SWORN SO TO THEE
THAT ALL THE WORLD SAID I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TURN'D
TO CHRISTIAN AND NO MIRACLE BEEN WROUGHT
WOULD IN ITSELF BE SUCH A MIRACLE
THE REST WERE NOT AN HUNDREDTH PART SO GREAT
E'EN THOU WENTST FORTH IN POVERTY AND HUNGER
TO SET THE GOODLY PLANT THAT FROM THE VINE
IT ONCE WAS NOW IS GROWN UNSIGHTLY BRAMBLE
THAT ENDED THROUGH THE HIGH CELESTIAL COURT
RESOUNDED ALL THE SPHERES
PRAISE WE ONE GOD
IN SONG OF MOST UNEARTHLY MELODY
AND WHEN THAT WORTHY THUS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
EXAMINING HAD LED ME THAT WE NOW
APPROACH'D THE TOPMOST BOUGH HE STRAIGHT RESUM'D
THE GRACE THAT HOLDS SWEET DALLIANCE WITH THY SOUL
SO FAR DISCREETLY HATH THY LIPS UNCLOS'D
THAT WHATSOE'ER HAS PAST THEM I COMMEND
BEHOOVES THEE TO EXPRESS WHAT THOU BELIEV'ST
THE NEXT AND WHEREON THY BELIEF HATH GROWN
O SAINTLY SIRE AND SPIRIT I BEGAN
WHO SEEST THAT WHICH THOU DIDST SO BELIEVE
AS TO OUTSTRIP FEET YOUNGER THAN THINE OWN
TOWARD THE SEPULCHRE THY WILL IS HERE
THAT I THE TENOUR OF MY CREED UNFOLD
AND THOU THE CAUSE OF IT HAST LIKEWISE ASK'D
AND I REPLY I IN ONE GOD BELIEVE
ONE SOLE ETERNAL GODHEAD OF WHOSE LOVE
ALL HEAV'N IS MOV'D HIMSELF UNMOV'D THE WHILE
NOR DEMONSTRATION PHYSICAL ALONE
OR MORE INTELLIGENTIAL AND ABSTRUSE
PERSUADES ME TO THIS FAITH BUT FROM THAT TRUTH
IT COMETH TO ME RATHER WHICH IS SHED
THROUGH MOSES THE RAPT PROPHETS AND THE PSALMS
THE GOSPEL AND THAT YE YOURSELVES DID WRITE
WHEN YE WERE GIFTED OF THE HOLY GHOST
IN THREE ETERNAL PERSONS I BELIEVE
ESSENCE THREEFOLD AND ONE MYSTERIOUS LEAGUE
OF UNION ABSOLUTE WHICH MANY A TIME
THE WORD OF GOSPEL LORE UPON MY MIND
IMPRINTS AND FROM THIS GERM THIS FIRSTLING SPARK
THE LIVELY FLAME DILATES AND LIKE HEAV'N'S STAR
DOTH GLITTER IN ME AS THE MASTER HEARS
WELL PLEAS'D AND THEN ENFOLDETH IN HIS ARMS
THE SERVANT WHO HATH JOYFUL TIDINGS BROUGHT
AND HAVING TOLD THE ERRAND KEEPS HIS PEACE
THUS BENEDICTION UTTERING WITH SONG
SOON AS MY PEACE I HELD COMPASS'D ME THRICE
THE APOSTOLIC RADIANCE WHOSE BEHEST
HAD OP'D LIPS SO WELL THEIR ANSWER PLEAS'D
CANTO XXV
IF E'ER THE SACRED POEM THAT HATH MADE
BOTH HEAV'N AND EARTH COPARTNERS IN ITS TOIL
AND WITH LEAN ABSTINENCE THROUGH MANY A YEAR
FADED MY BROW BE DESTIN'D TO PREVAIL
OVER THE CRUELTY WHICH BARS ME FORTH
OF THE FAIR SHEEP FOLD WHERE A SLEEPING LAMB
THE WOLVES SET ON AND FAIN HAD WORRIED ME
WITH OTHER VOICE AND FLEECE OF OTHER GRAIN
I SHALL FORTHWITH RETURN AND STANDING UP
AT MY BAPTISMAL FONT SHALL CLAIM THE WREATH
DUE TO THE POET'S TEMPLES FOR I THERE
FIRST ENTER'D ON THE FAITH WHICH MAKETH SOULS
ACCEPTABLE TO GOD AND FOR ITS SAKE
PETER HAD THEN CIRCLED MY FOREHEAD THUS
NEXT FROM THE SQUADRON WHENCE HAD ISSUED FORTH
THE FIRST FRUIT OF CHRIST'S VICARS ON THE EARTH
TOWARD US MOV'D A LIGHT AT VIEW WHEREOF
MY LADY FULL OF GLADNESS SPAKE TO ME
LO LO BEHOLD THE PEER OF MICKLE MIGHT
THAT MAKES FALICIA THRONG'D WITH VISITANTS
AS WHEN THE RING DOVE BY HIS MATE ALIGHTS
IN CIRCLES EACH ABOUT THE OTHER WHEELS
AND MURMURING COOES HIS FONDNESS THUS SAW I
ONE OF THE OTHER GREAT AND GLORIOUS PRINCE
WITH KINDLY GREETING HAIL'D EXTOLLING BOTH
THEIR HEAVENLY BANQUETING BUT WHEN AN END
WAS TO THEIR GRATULATION SILENT EACH
BEFORE ME SAT THEY DOWN SO BURNING BRIGHT
I COULD NOT LOOK UPON THEM
SMILING THEN
BEATRICE SPAKE O LIFE IN GLORY SHRIN'D
WHO DIDST THE LARGESS OF OUR KINGLY COURT
SET DOWN WITH FAITHFUL PEN LET NOW THY VOICE
OF HOPE THE PRAISES IN THIS HEIGHT RESOUND
FOR THOU WHO FIGUR'ST THEM IN SHAPES AS CLEAR
AS JESUS STOOD BEFORE THEE WELL CAN'ST SPEAK THEM
LIFT UP THY HEAD AND BE THOU STRONG IN TRUST
FOR THAT WHICH HITHER FROM THE MORTAL WORLD
ARRIVETH MUST BE RIPEN'D IN OUR BEAM
SUCH CHEERING ACCENTS FROM THE SECOND FLAME
ASSUR'D ME AND MINE EYES I LIFTED UP
UNTO THE MOUNTAINS THAT HAD BOW'D THEM LATE
WITH OVER HEAVY BURDEN
SITH OUR LIEGE
WILLS OF HIS GRACE THAT THOU OR ERE THY DEATH
IN THE MOST SECRET COUNCIL WITH HIS LORDS
SHOULDST BE CONFRONTED SO THAT HAVING VIEW'D
THE GLORIES OF OUR COURT THOU MAYST THEREWITH
THYSELF AND ALL WHO HEAR INVIGORATE
WITH HOPE THAT LEADS TO BLISSFUL END DECLARE
WHAT IS THAT HOPE HOW IT DOTH FLOURISH IN THEE
AND WHENCE THOU HADST IT THUS PROCEEDING STILL
THE SECOND LIGHT AND SHE WHOSE GENTLE LOVE
MY SOARING PENNONS IN THAT LOFTY FLIGHT
ESCORTED THUS PREVENTING ME REJOIN'D
AMONG HER SONS NOT ONE MORE FULL OF HOPE
HATH THE CHURCH MILITANT SO 'T IS OF HIM
RECORDED IN THE SUN WHOSE LIBERAL ORB
ENLIGHTENETH ALL OUR TRIBE AND ERE HIS TERM
OF WARFARE HENCE PERMITTED HE IS COME
FROM EGYPT TO JERUSALEM TO SEE
THE OTHER POINTS BOTH WHICH THOU HAST INQUIR'D
NOT FOR MORE KNOWLEDGE BUT THAT HE MAY TELL
HOW DEAR THOU HOLDST THE VIRTUE THESE TO HIM
LEAVE I FOR HE MAY ANSWER THEE WITH EASE
AND WITHOUT BOASTING SO GOD GIVE HIM GRACE
LIKE TO THE SCHOLAR PRACTIS'D IN HIS TASK
WHO WILLING TO GIVE PROOF OF DILIGENCE
SECONDS HIS TEACHER GLADLY HOPE SAID I
IS OF THE JOY TO COME A SURE EXPECTANCE
TH' EFFECT OF GRACE DIVINE AND MERIT PRECEDING
THIS LIGHT FROM MANY A STAR VISITS MY HEART
BUT FLOW'D TO ME THE FIRST FROM HIM WHO SANG
THE SONGS OF THE SUPREME HIMSELF SUPREME
AMONG HIS TUNEFUL BRETHREN
'LET ALL HOPE
IN THEE SO SPEAK HIS ANTHEM 'WHO HAVE KNOWN
THY NAME AND WITH MY FAITH WHO KNOW NOT THAT
FROM THEE THE NEXT DISTILLING FROM HIS SPRING
IN THINE EPISTLE FELL ON ME THE DROPS
SO PLENTEOUSLY THAT I ON OTHERS SHOWER
THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR DEW WHILEAS I SPAKE
A LAMPING AS OF QUICK AND VOLLIED LIGHTNING
WITHIN THE BOSOM OF THAT MIGHTY SHEEN
PLAY'D TREMULOUS THEN FORTH THESE ACCENTS BREATH'D
LOVE FOR THE VIRTUE WHICH ATTENDED ME
E'EN TO THE PALM AND ISSUING FROM THE FIELD
GLOWS VIGOROUS YET WITHIN ME AND INSPIRES
TO ASK OF THEE WHOM ALSO IT DELIGHTS
WHAT PROMISE THOU FROM HOPE IN CHIEF DOST WIN
BOTH SCRIPTURES NEW AND ANCIENT I REPLY'D
PROPOSE THE MARK WHICH EVEN NOW I VIEW
FOR SOULS BELOV'D OF GOD
ISAIAS SAITH
THAT IN THEIR OWN LAND EACH ONE MUST BE CLAD
IN TWOFOLD VESTURE AND THEIR PROPER LANDS THIS DELICIOUS LIFE
IN TERMS MORE FULL
AND CLEARER FAR THY BROTHER HATH SET FORTH
THIS REVELATION TO US WHERE HE TELLS
OF THE WHITE RAIMENT DESTIN'D TO THE SAINTS
AND AS THE WORDS WERE ENDING FROM ABOVE
THEY HOPE IN THEE FIRST HEARD WE CRIED WHERETO
ANSWER'D THE CAROLS ALL
AMIDST THEM NEXT
A LIGHT OF SO CLEAR AMPLITUDE EMERG'D
THAT WINTER'S MONTH WERE BUT A SINGLE DAY
WERE SUCH A CRYSTAL IN THE CANCER'S SIGN
LIKE AS A VIRGIN RISETH UP AND GOES
AND ENTERS ON THE MAZES OF THE DANCE
THOUGH GAY YET INNOCENT OF WORSE INTENT
THAN TO DO FITTING HONOUR TO THE BRIDE
SO I BEHELD THE NEW EFFULGENCE COME
UNTO THE OTHER TWO WHO IN A RING
WHEEL'D AS BECAME THEIR RAPTURE
IN THE DANCE
AND IN THE SONG IT MINGLED
AND THE DAME
HELD ON THEM FIX'D HER LOOKS E'EN AS THE SPOUSE
SILENT AND MOVELESS
THIS IS HE WHO LAY
UPON THE BOSOM OF OUR PELICAN
THIS HE INTO WHOSE KEEPING FROM THE CROSS
THE MIGHTY CHARGE WAS GIVEN THUS SHE SPAKE
YET THEREFORE NAUGHT THE MORE REMOV'D HER SIGHT
FROM MARKING THEM OR ERE HER WORDS BEGAN
OR WHEN THEY CLOS'D
AS HE WHO LOOKS INTENT
AND STRIVES WITH SEARCHING KEN HOW HE MAY SEE
THE SUN IN HIS ECLIPSE AND THROUGH DESIRE
OF SEEING LOSETH POWER OF SIGHT SO I
PEER'D ON THAT LAST RESPLENDENCE WHILE I HEARD
WHY DAZZLEST THOU THINE EYES IN SEEKING THAT
WHICH HERE ABIDES NOT EARTH MY BODY IS
IN EARTH AND SHALL BE WITH THE REST SO LONG
AS TILL OUR NUMBER EQUAL THE DECREE
OF THE MOST HIGH
THE TWO THAT HAVE ASCENDED
IN THIS OUR BLESSED CLOISTER SHINE ALONE
WITH THE TWO GARMENTS
SO REPORT BELOW
AS WHEN FOR EASE OF LABOUR OR TO SHUN
SUSPECTED PERIL AT A WHISTLE'S BREATH
THE OARS EREWHILE DASH'D FREQUENT IN THE WAVE
ALL REST THE FLAMY CIRCLE AT THAT VOICE
SO RESTED AND THE MINGLING SOUND WAS STILL
WHICH FROM THE TRINAL BAND SOFT BREATHING ROSE
I TURN'D BUT AH HOW TREMBLED IN MY THOUGHT
WHEN LOOKING AT MY SIDE AGAIN TO SEE
BEATRICE I DESCRIED HER NOT ALTHOUGH
NOT DISTANT ON THE HAPPY COAST SHE STOOD
CANTO XXVI
WITH DAZZLED EYES WHILST WOND'RING I REMAIN'D
FORTH OF THE BEAMY FLAME WHICH DAZZLED ME
ISSUED A BREATH THAT IN ATTENTION MUTE
DETAIN'D ME AND THESE WORDS IT SPAKE 'T WERE WELL
THAT LONG AS TILL THY VISION ON MY FORM
O'ERSPENT REGAIN ITS VIRTUE WITH DISCOURSE
THOU COMPENSATE THE BRIEF DELAY
SAY THEN
BEGINNING TO WHAT POINT THY SOUL ASPIRES
AND MEANWHILE REST ASSUR'D THAT SIGHT IN THEE
IS BUT O'ERPOWERED A SPACE NOT WHOLLY QUENCH'D
SINCE THY FAIR GUIDE AND LOVELY IN HER LOOK
HATH POTENCY THE LIKE TO THAT WHICH DWELT
IN ANANIAS' HAND I ANSWERING THUS
BE TO MINE EYES THE REMEDY OR LATE
OR EARLY AT HER PLEASURE FOR THEY WERE
THE GATES AT WHICH SHE ENTER'D AND DID LIGHT
HER NEVER DYING FIRE
MY WISHES HERE
ARE CENTERED IN THIS PALACE IS THE WEAL
THAT ALPHA AND OMEGA IS TO ALL
THE LESSONS LOVE CAN READ ME YET AGAIN
THE VOICE WHICH HAD DISPERS'D MY FEAR WHEN DAZ'D
WITH THAT EXCESS TO CONVERSE URG'D AND SPAKE
BEHOOVES THEE SIFT MORE NARROWLY THY TERMS
AND SAY WHO LEVEL'D AT THIS SCOPE THY BOW
PHILOSOPHY SAID I ''HATH ARGUMENTS
AND THIS PLACE HATH AUTHORITY ENOUGH
'T' IMPRINT IN ME SUCH LOVE FOR OF CONSTRAINT
GOOD INASMUCH AS WE PERCEIVE THE GOOD
KINDLES OUR LOVE AND IN DEGREE THE MORE
AS IT COMPRISES MORE OF GOODNESS IN 'T
THE ESSENCE THEN WHERE SUCH ADVANTAGE IS
THAT EACH GOOD FOUND WITHOUT IT IS NAUGHT ELSE
BUT OF HIS LIGHT THE BEAM MUST NEEDS ATTRACT
THE SOUL OF EACH ONE LOVING WHO THE TRUTH
DISCERNS ON WHICH THIS PROOF IS BUILT
SUCH TRUTH
LEARN I FROM HIM WHO SHOWS ME THE FIRST LOVE
OF ALL INTELLIGENTIAL SUBSTANCES
ETERNAL FROM HIS VOICE I LEARN WHOSE WORD
IS TRUTH THAT OF HIMSELF TO MOSES SAITH
'I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOOD BEFORE THEE PASS
LASTLY FROM THEE I LEARN WHO CHIEF PROCLAIM'ST
E'EN AT THE OUTSET OF THY HERALDING
IN MORTAL EARS THE MYSTERY OF HEAV'N
THROUGH HUMAN WISDOM AND TH' AUTHORITY
THEREWITH AGREEING HEARD I ANSWER'D KEEP
THE CHOICEST OF THY LOVE FOR GOD
BUT SAY
IF THOU YET OTHER CORDS WITHIN THEE FEEL'ST
THAT DRAW THEE TOWARDS HIM SO THAT THOU REPORT
HOW MANY ARE THE FANGS WITH WHICH THIS LOVE
IS GRAPPLED TO THY SOUL I DID NOT MISS
TO WHAT INTENT THE EAGLE OF OUR LORD
HAD POINTED HIS DEMAND YEA NOTED WELL
TH' AVOWAL WHICH HE LED TO AND RESUM'D
ALL GRAPPLING BONDS THAT KNIT THE HEART TO GOD
CONFEDERATE TO MAKE FAST OUR CLARITY
THE BEING OF THE WORLD AND MINE OWN BEING
THE DEATH WHICH HE ENDUR'D THAT I SHOULD LIVE
AND THAT WHICH ALL THE FAITHFUL HOPE AS I DO
TO THE FOREMENTION'D LIVELY KNOWLEDGE JOIN'D
HAVE FROM THE SEA OF ILL LOVE SAV'D MY BARK
AND ON THE COAST SECUR'D IT OF THE RIGHT
AS FOR THE LEAVES THAT IN THE GARDEN BLOOM
MY LOVE FOR THEM IS GREAT AS IS THE GOOD
DEALT BY TH' ETERNAL HAND THAT TENDS THEM ALL
I ENDED AND THEREWITH A SONG MOST SWEET
RANG THROUGH THE SPHERES AND HOLY HOLY HOLY
ACCORDANT WITH THE REST MY LADY SANG
AND AS A SLEEP IS BROKEN AND DISPERS'D
THROUGH SHARP ENCOUNTER OF THE NIMBLE LIGHT
WITH THE EYE'S SPIRIT RUNNING FORTH TO MEET
THE RAY FROM MEMBRANE ON TO THE MEMBRANE URG'D
AND THE UPSTARTLED WIGHT LOATHES THAT HE SEES
SO AT HIS SUDDEN WAKING HE MISDEEMS
OF ALL AROUND HIM TILL ASSURANCE WAITS
ON BETTER JUDGMENT THUS THE SAINTLY CAME
DROVE FROM BEFORE MINE EYES THE MOTES AWAY
WITH THE RESPLENDENCE OF HER OWN THAT CAST
THEIR BRIGHTNESS DOWNWARD THOUSAND MILES BELOW
WHENCE I MY VISION CLEARER SHALL BEFORE
RECOVER'D AND WELL NIGH ASTOUNDED ASK'D
OF A FOURTH LIGHT THAT NOW WITH US I SAW
AND BEATRICE THE FIRST DIVING SOUL
THAT EVER THE FIRST VIRTUE FRAM'D ADMIRES
WITHIN THESE RAYS HIS MAKER LIKE THE LEAF
THAT BOWS ITS LITHE TOP TILL THE BLAST IS BLOWN
BY ITS OWN VIRTUE REAR'D THEN STANDS ALOOF
SO I THE WHILST SHE SAID AWE STRICKEN BOW'D
THEN EAGERNESS TO SPEAK EMBOLDEN'D ME
AND I BEGAN O FRUIT THAT WAST ALONE
MATURE WHEN FIRST ENGENDER'D ANCIENT FATHER
THAT DOUBLY SEEST IN EVERY WEDDED BRIDE
THY DAUGHTER BY AFFINITY AND BLOOD
DEVOUTLY AS I MAY I PRAY THEE HOLD
CONVERSE WITH ME MY WILL THOU SEEST AND I
MORE SPEEDILY TO HEAR THEE TELL IT NOT
IT CHANCETH OFT SOME ANIMAL BEWRAYS
THROUGH THE SLEEK COV'RING OF HIS FURRY COAT
THE FONDNESS THAT STIRS IN HIM AND CONFORMS
HIS OUTSIDE SEEMING TO THE CHEER WITHIN
AND IN LIKE GUISE WAS ADAM'S SPIRIT MOV'D
TO JOYOUS MOOD THAT THROUGH THE COVERING SHONE
TRANSPARENT WHEN TO PLEASURE ME IT SPAKE
NO NEED THY WILL BE TOLD WHICH I UNTOLD
BETTER DISCERN THAN THOU WHATEVER THING
THOU HOLDST MOST CERTAIN FOR THAT WILL I SEE
IN HIM WHO IS TRUTH'S MIRROR AND HIMSELF
PARHELION UNTO ALL THINGS AND NAUGHT ELSE
TO HIM
THIS WOULDST THOU HEAR HOW LONG SINCE GOD
PLAC'D ME HIGH GARDEN FROM WHOSE HOUNDS
SHE LED ME UP IN THIS LADDER STEEP AND LONG
WHAT SPACE ENDUR'D MY SEASON OF DELIGHT
WHENCE TRULY SPRANG THE WRATH THAT BANISH'D ME
AND WHAT THE LANGUAGE WHICH I SPAKE AND FRAM'D
NOT THAT I TASTED OF THE TREE MY SON
WAS IN ITSELF THE CAUSE OF THAT EXILE
BUT ONLY MY TRANSGRESSING OF THE MARK
ASSIGN'D ME
THERE WHENCE AT THY LADY'S HEST
THE MANTUAN MOV'D HIM STILL WAS I DEBARR'D
THIS COUNCIL TILL THE SUN HAD MADE COMPLETE
FOUR THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED ROUNDS AND TWICE
HIS ANNUAL JOURNEY AND THROUGH EVERY LIGHT
IN HIS BROAD PATHWAY SAW I HIM RETURN
THOUSAND SAVE SEV'NTY TIMES THE WHILST I DWELT
UPON THE EARTH
THE LANGUAGE I DID USE
WAS WORN AWAY OR EVER NIMROD'S RACE
THEIR UNACCOMPLISHABLE WORK BEGAN
FOR NAUGHT THAT MAN INCLINES TO ERE WAS LASTING
LEFT BY HIS REASON FREE AND VARIABLE
AS IS THE SKY THAT SWAYS HIM
THAT HE SPEAKS
IS NATURE'S PROMPTING WHETHER THUS OR THUS
SHE LEAVES TO YOU AS YE DO MOST AFFECT IT
ERE I DESCENDED INTO HELL'S ABYSS
EL WAS THE NAME ON EARTH OF THE CHIEF GOOD
WHOSE JOY ENFOLDS ME ELI THEN 'T WAS CALL'D
AND SO BESEEMETH FOR IN MORTALS USE
IS AS THE LEAF UPON THE BOUGH THAT GOES
AND OTHER COMES INSTEAD
UPON THE MOUNT
MOST HIGH ABOVE THE WATERS ALL MY LIFE
BOTH INNOCENT AND GUILTY DID BUT REACH
FROM THE FIRST HOUR TO THAT WHICH COMETH NEXT
AS THE SUN CHANGES QUARTER TO THE SIXTH
CANTO XXVII
THEN GLORY TO THE FATHER TO THE SON
AND TO THE HOLY SPIRIT RANG ALOUD
THROUGHOUT ALL PARADISE THAT WITH THE SONG
MY SPIRIT REEL'D SO PASSING SWEET THE STRAIN
AND WHAT I SAW WAS EQUAL ECSTASY
ONE UNIVERSAL SMILE IT SEEM'D OF ALL THINGS
JOY PAST COMPARE GLADNESS UNUTTERABLE
IMPERISHABLE LIFE OF PEACE AND LOVE
EXHAUSTLESS RICHES AND UNMEASUR'D BLISS
BEFORE MINE EYES STOOD THE FOUR TORCHES LIT
AND THAT WHICH FIRST HAD COME BEGAN TO WAX
IN BRIGHTNESS AND IN SEMBLANCE SUCH BECAME
AS JOVE MIGHT BE IF HE AND MARS WERE BIRDS
AND INTERCHANG'D THEIR PLUMES
SILENCE ENSUED
THROUGH THE BLEST QUIRE BY HIM WHO HERE APPOINTS
VICISSITUDE OF MINISTRY ENJOIN'D
WHEN THUS I HEARD WONDER NOT IF MY HUE
BE CHANG'D FOR WHILE I SPEAK THESE SHALT THOU SEE
ALL IN LIKE MANNER CHANGE WITH ME
MY PLACE
HE WHO USURPS ON EARTH MY PLACE AY MINE
WHICH IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SON OF GOD
IS VOID THE SAME HATH MADE MY CEMETERY
A COMMON SEWER OF PUDDLE AND OF BLOOD
THE MORE BELOW HIS TRIUMPH WHO FROM HENCE
MALIGNANT FELL SUCH COLOUR AS THE SUN
AT EVE OR MORNING PAINTS AN ADVERSE CLOUD
THEN SAW I SPRINKLED OVER ALL THE SKY
AND AS TH' UNBLEMISH'D DAME WHO IN HERSELF
SECURE OF CENSURE YET AT BARE REPORT
OF OTHER'S FAILING SHRINKS WITH MAIDEN FEAR
SO BEATRICE IN HER SEMBLANCE CHANG'D
AND SUCH ECLIPSE IN HEAV'N METHINKS WAS SEEN
WHEN THE MOST HOLY SUFFER'D
THEN THE WORDS
PROCEEDED WITH VOICE ALTER'D FROM ITSELF
SO CLEAN THE SEMBLANCE DID NOT ALTER MORE
NOT TO THIS END WAS CHRIST'S SPOUSE WITH MY BLOOD
WITH THAT OF LINUS AND OF CLETUS FED
THAT SHE MIGHT SERVE FOR PURCHASE OF BASE GOLD
BUT FOR THE PURCHASE OF THIS HAPPY LIFE
DID SEXTUS PIUS AND CALLIXTUS BLEED
AND URBAN THEY WHOSE DOOM WAS NOT WITHOUT
MUCH WEEPING SEAL'D
NO PURPOSE WAS OF OUR
THAT ON THE RIGHT HAND OF OUR SUCCESSORS
PART OF THE CHRISTIAN PEOPLE SHOULD BE SET
AND PART UPON THEIR LEFT NOR THAT THE KEYS
WHICH WERE VOUCHSAF'D ME SHOULD FOR ENSIGN SERVE
UNTO THE BANNERS THAT DO LEVY WAR
ON THE BAPTIZ'D NOR I FOR SIGIL MARK
SET UPON SOLD AND LYING PRIVILEGES
WHICH MAKES ME OFT TO BICKER AND TURN RED
IN SHEPHERD'S CLOTHING GREEDY WOLVES BELOW
RANGE WIDE O'ER ALL THE PASTURES
ARM OF GOD
WHY LONGER SLEEPST THOU CAORSINES AND GASCONA
PREPARE TO QUAFF OUR BLOOD
O GOOD BEGINNING
TO WHAT A VILE CONCLUSION MUST THOU STOOP
BUT THE HIGH PROVIDENCE WHICH DID DEFEND
THROUGH SCIPIO THE WORLD'S GLORY UNTO ROME
WILL NOT DELAY ITS SUCCOUR AND THOU SON
WHO THROUGH THY MORTAL WEIGHT SHALL YET AGAIN
RETURN BELOW OPEN THY LIPS NOR HIDE
WHAT IS BY ME NOT HIDDEN AS A HOOD
OF FROZEN VAPOURS STREAMS ADOWN THE AIR
WHAT TIME THE SHE GOAT WITH HER SKIEY HORN
TOUCHES THE SUN SO SAW I THERE STREAM WIDE
THE VAPOURS WHO WITH US HAD LINGER'D LATE
AND WITH GLAD TRIUMPH DECK TH' ETHEREAL COPE
ONWARD MY SIGHT THEIR SEMBLANCES PURSUED
SO FAR PURSUED AS TILL THE SPACE BETWEEN
FROM ITS REACH SEVER'D THEM WHEREAT THE GUIDE
CELESTIAL MARKING ME NO MORE INTENT
ON UPWARD GAZING SAID LOOK DOWN AND SEE
WHAT CIRCUIT THOU HAST COMPASS'D FROM THE HOUR
WHEN I BEFORE HAD CAST MY VIEW BENEATH
ALL THE FIRST REGION OVERPAST I SAW
WHICH FROM THE MIDMOST TO THE BOUND'RY WINDS
THAT ONWARD THENCE FROM GADES I BEHELD
THE UNWISE PASSAGE OF LAERTES' SON
AND HITHERWARD THE SHORE WHERE THOU EUROPA
MAD'ST THEE A JOYFUL BURDEN AND YET MORE
OF THIS DIM SPOT HAD SEEN BUT THAT THE SUN
A CONSTELLATION OFF AND MORE HAD TA'EN
HIS PROGRESS IN THE ZODIAC UNDERNEATH
THEN BY THE SPIRIT THAT DOTH NEVER LEAVE
ITS AMOROUS DALLIANCE WITH MY LADY'S LOOKS
BACK WITH REDOUBLED ARDOUR WERE MINE EYES
LED UNTO HER AND FROM HER RADIANT SMILES
WHENAS I TURN'D ME PLEASURE SO DIVINE
DID LIGHTEN ON ME THAT WHATEVER BAIT
OR ART OR NATURE IN THE HUMAN FLESH
OR IN ITS LIMN'D RESEMBLANCE CAN COMBINE
THROUGH GREEDY EYES TO TAKE THE SOUL WITHAL
WERE TO HER BEAUTY NOTHING
ITS BOON INFLUENCE
FROM THE FAIR NEST OF LEDA RAPT ME FORTH
AND WAFTED ON INTO THE SWIFTEST HEAV'N
WHAT PLACE FOR ENTRANCE BEATRICE CHOSE
I MAY NOT SAY SO UNIFORM WAS ALL
LIVELIEST AND LOFTIEST
SHE MY SECRET WISH
DIVIN'D AND WITH SUCH GLADNESS THAT GOD'S LOVE
SEEM'D FROM HER VISAGE SHINING THUS BEGAN
HERE IS THE GOAL WHENCE MOTION ON HIS RACE
STARTS MOTIONLESS THE CENTRE AND THE REST
ALL MOV'D AROUND
EXCEPT THE SOUL DIVINE
PLACE IN THIS HEAV'N IS NONE THE SOUL DIVINE
WHEREIN THE LOVE WHICH RULETH O'ER ITS ORB
IS KINDLED AND THE VIRTUE THAT IT SHEDS
ONE CIRCLE LIGHT AND LOVE ENCLASPING IT
AS THIS DOTH CLASP THE OTHERS AND TO HIM
WHO DRAWS THE BOUND ITS LIMIT ONLY KNOWN
MEASUR'D ITSELF BY NONE IT DOTH DIVIDE
MOTION TO ALL COUNTED UNTO THEM FORTH
AS BY THE FIFTH OR HALF YE COUNT FORTH TEN
THE VASE WHEREIN TIME'S ROOTS ARE PLUNG'D THOU SEEST
LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR THE LEAVES
O MORTAL LUST
THAT CANST NOT LIFT THY HEAD ABOVE THE WAVES
WHICH WHELM AND SINK THEE DOWN THE WILL IN MAN
BEARS GOODLY BLOSSOMS BUT ITS RUDDY PROMISE
IS BY THE DRIPPING OF PERPETUAL RAIN
MADE MERE ABORTION FAITH AND INNOCENCE
ARE MET WITH BUT IN BABES EACH TAKING LEAVE
ERE CHEEKS WITH DOWN ARE SPRINKLED HE THAT FASTS
WHILE YET A STAMMERER WITH HIS TONGUE LET LOOSE
GLUTS EVERY FOOD ALIKE IN EVERY MOON
ONE YET A BABBLER LOVES AND LISTENS TO
HIS MOTHER BUT NO SOONER HATH FREE USE
OF SPEECH THAN HE DOTH WISH HER IN HER GRAVE
SO SUDDENLY DOTH THE FAIR CHILD OF HIM
WHOSE WELCOME IS THE MORN AND EVE HIS PARTING
TO NEGRO BLACKNESS CHANGE HER VIRGIN WHITE
THOU TO ABATE THY WONDER NOTE THAT NONE
BEARS RULE IN EARTH AND ITS FRAIL FAMILY
ARE THEREFORE WAND'RERS
YET BEFORE THE DATE
WHEN THROUGH THE HUNDREDTH IN HIS RECK'NING DROPS
PALE JANUARY MUST BE SHOR'D ASIDE
FROM WINTER'S CALENDAR THESE HEAV'NLY SPHERES
SHALL ROAR SO LOUD THAT FORTUNE SHALL BE FAIN
TO TURN THE POOP WHERE SHE HATH NOW THE PROW
SO THAT THE FLEET RUN ONWARD AND TRUE FRUIT
EXPECTED LONG SHALL CROWN AT LAST THE BLOOM
CANTO XXVII
SO SHE WHO DOTH IMPARADISE MY SOUL
HAD DRAWN THE VEIL FROM OFF OUR PLEASANT LIFE
AND BAR'D THE TRUTH OF POOR MORTALITY
WHEN LO AS ONE WHO IN A MIRROR SPIES
THE SHINING OF A FLAMBEAU AT HIS BACK
LIT SUDDEN ORE HE DEEM OF ITS APPROACH
AND TURNETH TO RESOLVE HIM IF THE GLASS
HAVE TOLD HIM TRUE AND SEES THE RECORD FAITHFUL
AS NOTE IS TO ITS METRE EVEN THUS
I WELL REMEMBER DID BEFALL TO ME
LOOKING UPON THE BEAUTEOUS EYES WHENCE LOVE
HAD MADE THE LEASH TO TAKE ME
AS I TURN'D
AND THAT WHICH IN THEIR CIRCLES NONE WHO SPIES
CAN MISS OF IN ITSELF APPARENT STRUCK
ON MINE A POINT I SAW THAT DARTED LIGHT
SO SHARP NO LID UNCLOSING MAY BEAR UP
AGAINST ITS KEENNESS
THE LEAST STAR WE VIEW
FROM HENCE HAD SEEM'D A MOON SET BY ITS SIDE
AS STAR BY SIDE OF STAR
AND SO FAR OFF
PERCHANCE AS IS THE HALO FROM THE LIGHT
WHICH PAINTS IT WHEN MOST DENSE THE VAPOUR SPREADS
THERE WHEEL'D ABOUT THE POINT A CIRCLE OF FIRE
MORE RAPID THAN THE MOTION WHICH FIRST GIRDS
THE WORLD
THEN CIRCLE AFTER CIRCLE ROUND
ENRING'D EACH OTHER TILL THE SEVENTH REACH'D
CIRCUMFERENCE SO AMPLE THAT ITS BOW
WITHIN THE SPAN OF JUNO'S MESSENGER
LIED SCARCE BEEN HELD ENTIRE
BEYOND THE SEV'NTH
FOLLOW'D YET OTHER TWO
AND EVERY ONE
AS MORE IN NUMBER DISTANT FROM THE FIRST
WAS TARDIER IN MOTION AND THAT GLOW'D
WITH FLAME MOST PURE THAT TO THE SPARKLE' OF TRUTH
WAS NEAREST AS PARTAKING MOST METHINKS
OF ITS REALITY
THE GUIDE BELOV'D
SAW ME IN ANXIOUS THOUGHT SUSPENSE AND SPAKE
HEAV'N AND ALL NATURE HANGS UPON THAT POINT
THE CIRCLE THERETO MOST CONJOIN'D OBSERVE
AND KNOW THAT BY INTENSER LOVE ITS COURSE
IS TO THIS SWIFTNESS WING'D TO WHOM I THUS
IT WERE ENOUGH NOR SHOULD I FURTHER SEEK
HAD I BUT WITNESS'D ORDER IN THE WORLD
APPOINTED SUCH AS IN THESE WHEELS IS SEEN
BUT IN THE SENSIBLE WORLD SUCH DIFF'RENCE IS
THAT IS EACH ROUND SHOWS MORE DIVINITY
AS EACH IS WIDER FROM THE CENTRE
HENCE
IF IN THIS WONDROUS AND ANGELIC TEMPLE
THAT HATH FOR CONFINE ONLY LIGHT AND LOVE
MY WISH MAY HAVE COMPLETION I MUST KNOW
WHEREFORE SUCH DISAGREEMENT IS BETWEEN
TH' EXEMPLAR AND ITS COPY FOR MYSELF
CONTEMPLATING I FAIL TO PIERCE THE CAUSE
IT IS NO MARVEL IF THY FINGERS FOIL'D
DO LEAVE THE KNOT UNTIED SO HARD 'T IS GROWN
FOR WANT OF TENTING THUS SHE SAID BUT TAKE
SHE ADDED IF THOU WISH THY CURE MY WORDS
AND ENTERTAIN THEM SUBTLY
EVERY ORB
CORPOREAL DOTH PROPORTION ITS EXTENT
UNTO THE VIRTUE THROUGH ITS PARTS DIFFUS'D
THE GREATER BLESSEDNESS PRESERVES THE MORE
THE GREATER IS THE BODY IF ALL PARTS
SHARE EQUALLY THE MORE IS TO PRESERVE
THEREFORE THE CIRCLE WHOSE SWIFT COURSE ENWHEELS
THE UNIVERSAL FRAME ANSWERS TO THAT
WHICH IS SUPREME IN KNOWLEDGE AND IN LOVE
THUS BY THE VIRTUE NOT THE SEEMING BREADTH
OF SUBSTANCE MEASURE THOU SHALT SEE THE HEAV'NS
EACH TO THE' INTELLIGENCE THAT RULETH IT
GREATER TO MORE AND SMALLER UNTO LESS
SUITED IN STRICT AND WONDROUS HARMONY
AS WHEN THE STURDY NORTH BLOWS FROM HIS CHEEK
A BLAST THAT SCOURS THE SKY FORTHWITH OUR AIR
CLEAR'D OF THE RACK THAT HUNG ON IT BEFORE
GLITTERS AND WITH HIS BEAUTIES ALL UNVEIL'D
THE FIRMAMENT LOOKS FORTH SERENE AND SMILES
SUCH WAS MY CHEER WHEN BEATRICE DROVE
WITH CLEAR REPLY THE SHADOWS BACK AND TRUTH
WAS MANIFESTED AS A STAR IN HEAVEN
AND WHEN THE WORDS WERE ENDED NOT UNLIKE
TO IRON IN THE FURNACE EVERY CIRQUE
EBULLIENT SHOT FORTH SCINTILLATING FIRES
AND EVERY SPARKLE SHIVERING TO NEW BLAZE
IN NUMBER DID OUTMILLION THE ACCOUNT
REDUPLICATE UPON THE CHEQUER'D BOARD
THEN HEARD I ECHOING ON FROM CHOIR TO CHOIR
HOSANNA TO THE FIXED POINT THAT HOLDS
AND SHALL FOR EVER HOLD THEM TO THEIR PLACE
FROM EVERLASTING IRREMOVABLE
MUSING AWHILE I STOOD AND SHE WHO SAW
BY INWARD MEDITATIONS THUS BEGAN
IN THE FIRST CIRCLES THEY WHOM THOU BEHELDST
ARE SERAPHIM AND CHERUBIM
THUS SWIFT
FOLLOW THEIR HOOPS IN LIKENESS TO THE POINT
NEAR AS THEY CAN APPROACHING AND THEY CAN
THE MORE THE LOFTIER THEIR VISION
THOSE
THAT ROUND THEM FLEET GAZING THE GODHEAD NEXT
ARE THRONES IN WHOM THE FIRST TRINE ENDS
AND ALL
ARE BLESSED EVEN AS THEIR SIGHT DESCENDS
DEEPER INTO THE TRUTH WHEREIN REST IS
FOR EVERY MIND
THUS HAPPINESS HATH ROOT
IN SEEING NOT IN LOVING WHICH OF SIGHT
IS AFTERGROWTH
AND OF THE SEEING SUCH
THE MEED AS UNTO EACH IN DUE DEGREE
GRACE AND GOOD WILL THEIR MEASURE HAVE ASSIGN'D
THE OTHER TRINE THAT WITH STILL OPENING BUDS
IN THIS ETERNAL SPRINGTIDE BLOSSOM FAIR
FEARLESS OF BRUISING FROM THE NIGHTLY RAM
BREATHE UP IN WARBLED MELODIES THREEFOLD
HOSANNAS BLENDING EVER FROM THE THREE
TRANSMITTED
HIERARCHY OF GODS FOR AYE
REJOICING DOMINATIONS FIRST NEXT THEN
VIRTUES AND POWERS THE THIRD
THE NEXT TO WHOM
ARE PRINCEDOMS AND ARCHANGELS WITH GLAD ROUND
TO TREAD THEIR FESTAL RING AND LAST THE BAND
ANGELICAL DISPORTING IN THEIR SPHERE
ALL AS THEY CIRCLE IN THEIR ORDERS LOOK
ALOFT AND DOWNWARD WITH SUCH SWAY PREVAIL
THAT ALL WITH MUTUAL IMPULSE TEND TO GOD
THESE ONCE A MORTAL VIEW BEHELD
DESIRE
IN DIONYSIUS SO INTENTLY WROUGHT
THAT HE AS I HAVE DONE RANG'D THEM AND NAM'D
THEIR ORDERS MARSHAL'D IN HIS THOUGHT
FROM HIM
DISSENTIENT ONE REFUS'D HIS SACRED READ
BUT SOON AS IN THIS HEAV'N HIS DOUBTING EYES
WERE OPEN'D GREGORY AT HIS ERROR SMIL'D
NOR MARVEL THAT A DENIZEN OF EARTH
SHOULD SCAN SUCH SECRET TRUTH FOR HE HAD LEARNT
BOTH THIS AND MUCH BESIDE OF THESE OUR ORBS
FROM AN EYE WITNESS TO HEAV'N'S MYSTERIES
CANTO XXIX
NO LONGER THAN WHAT TIME LATONA'S TWINS
COVER'D OF LIBRA AND THE FLEECY STAR
TOGETHER BOTH GIRDING THE' HORIZON HANG
IN EVEN BALANCE FROM THE ZENITH POIS'D
TILL FROM THAT VERGE EACH CHANGING HEMISPHERE
PART THE NICE LEVEL E'EN SO BRIEF A SPACE
DID BEATRICE'S SILENCE HOLD
A SMILE
BAT PAINTED ON HER CHEEK AND HER FIX'D GAZE
BENT ON THE POINT AT WHICH MY VISION FAIL'D
WHEN THUS HER WORDS RESUMING SHE BEGAN
I SPEAK NOR WHAT THOU WOULDST INQUIRE DEMAND
FOR I HAVE MARK'D IT WHERE ALL TIME AND PLACE
ARE PRESENT
NOT FOR INCREASE TO HIMSELF
OF GOOD WHICH MAY NOT BE INCREAS'D BUT FORTH
TO MANIFEST HIS GLORY BY ITS BEAMS
INHABITING HIS OWN ETERNITY
BEYOND TIME'S LIMIT OR WHAT BOUND SOE'ER
TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS BEING AS HE WILL'D
INTO NEW NATURES LIKE UNTO HIMSELF
ETERNAL LOVE UNFOLDED
NOR BEFORE
AS IF IN DULL INACTION TORPID LAY
FOR NOT IN PROCESS OF BEFORE OR AFT
UPON THESE WATERS MOV'D THE SPIRIT OF GOD
SIMPLE AND MIX'D BOTH FORM AND SUBSTANCE FORTH
TO PERFECT BEING STARTED LIKE THREE DARTS
SHOT FROM A BOW THREE CORDED
AND AS RAY
IN CRYSTAL GLASS AND AMBER SHINES ENTIRE
E'EN AT THE MOMENT OF ITS ISSUING THUS
DID FROM TH' ETERNAL SOVRAN BEAM ENTIRE
HIS THREEFOLD OPERATION AT ONE ACT
PRODUC'D COEVAL
YET IN ORDER EACH
CREATED HIS DUE STATION KNEW THOSE HIGHEST
WHO PURE INTELLIGENCE WERE MADE MERE POWER
THE LOWEST IN THE MIDST BOUND WITH STRICT LEAGUE
INTELLIGENCE AND POWER UNSEVER'D BOND
LONG TRACT OF AGES BY THE ANGELS PAST
ERE THE CREATING OF ANOTHER WORLD
DESCRIB'D ON JEROME'S PAGES THOU HAST SEEN
BUT THAT WHAT I DISCLOSE TO THEE IS TRUE
THOSE PENMEN WHOM THE HOLY SPIRIT MOV'D
IN MANY A PASSAGE OF THEIR SACRED BOOK
ATTEST AS THOU BY DILIGENT SEARCH SHALT FIND
AND REASON IN SOME SORT DISCERNS THE SAME
WHO SCARCE WOULD GRANT THE HEAV'NLY MINISTERS
OF THEIR PERFECTION VOID SO LONG A SPACE
THUS WHEN AND WHERE THESE SPIRITS OF LOVE WERE MADE
THOU KNOW'ST AND HOW AND KNOWING HAST ALLAY'D
THY THIRST WHICH FROM THE TRIPLE QUESTION ROSE
ERE ONE HAD RECKON'D TWENTY E'EN SO SOON
PART OF THE ANGELS FELL AND IN THEIR FALL
CONFUSION TO YOUR ELEMENTS ENSUED
THE OTHERS KEPT THEIR STATION AND THIS TASK
WHEREON THOU LOOKST BEGAN WITH SUCH DELIGHT
THAT THEY SURCEASE NOT EVER DAY NOR NIGHT
THEIR CIRCLING
OF THAT FATAL LAPSE THE CAUSE
WAS THE CURST PRIDE OF HIM WHOM THOU HAST SEEN
PENT WITH THE WORLD'S INCUMBRANCE
THOSE WHOM HERE
THOU SEEST WERE LOWLY TO CONFESS THEMSELVES
OF HIS FREE BOUNTY WHO HAD MADE THEM APT
FOR MINISTRIES SO HIGH THEREFORE THEIR VIEWS
WERE BY ENLIGHT'NING GRACE AND THEIR OWN MERIT
EXALTED SO THAT IN THEIR WILL CONFIRM'D
THEY STAND NOR FEEL TO FALL
FOR DO NOT DOUBT
BUT TO RECEIVE THE GRACE WHICH HEAV'N VOUCHSAFES
IS MERITORIOUS EVEN AS THE SOUL
WITH PROMPT AFFECTION WELCOMETH THE GUEST
NOW WITHOUT FURTHER HELP IF WITH GOOD HEED
MY WORDS THY MIND HAVE TREASUR'D THOU HENCEFORTH
THIS CONSISTORY ROUND ABOUT MAYST SCAN
AND GAZE THY FILL
BUT SINCE THOU HAST ON EARTH
HEARD VAIN DISPUTERS REASONERS IN THE SCHOOLS
CANVAS THE' ANGELIC NATURE AND DISPUTE
ITS POWERS OF APPREHENSION MEMORY CHOICE
THEREFORE 'T IS WELL THOU TAKE FROM ME THE TRUTH
PURE AND WITHOUT DISGUISE WHICH THEY BELOW
EQUIVOCATING DARKEN AND PERPLEX
KNOW THOU THAT FROM THE FIRST THESE SUBSTANCES
REJOICING IN THE COUNTENANCE OF GOD
HAVE HELD UNCEASINGLY THEIR VIEW INTENT
UPON THE GLORIOUS VISION FROM THE WHICH
NAUGHT ABSENT IS NOR HID WHERE THEN NO CHANGE
OF NEWNESS WITH SUCCESSION INTERRUPTS
REMEMBRANCE THERE NEEDS NONE TO GATHER UP
DIVIDED THOUGHT AND IMAGES REMOTE
SO THAT MEN THUS AT VARIANCE WITH THE TRUTH
DREAM THOUGH THEIR EYES BE OPEN RECKLESS SOME
OF ERROR OTHERS WELL AWARE THEY ERR
TO WHOM MORE GUILT AND SHAME ARE JUSTLY DUE
EACH THE KNOWN TRACK OF SAGE PHILOSOPHY
DESERTS AND HAS A BYWAY OF HIS OWN
SO MUCH THE RESTLESS EAGERNESS TO SHINE
AND LOVE OF SINGULARITY PREVAIL
YET THIS OFFENSIVE AS IT IS PROVOKES
HEAV'N'S ANGER LESS THAN WHEN THE BOOK OF GOD
IS FORC'D TO YIELD TO MAN'S AUTHORITY
OR FROM ITS STRAIGHTNESS WARP'D NO RECK'NING MADE
WHAT BLOOD THE SOWING OF IT IN THE WORLD
HAS COST WHAT FAVOUR FOR HIMSELF HE WINS
WHO MEEKLY CLINGS TO IT
THE AIM OF ALL
IS HOW TO SHINE E'EN THEY WHOSE OFFICE IS
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL LET THE GOSPEL SLEEP
AND PASS THEIR OWN INVENTIONS OFF INSTEAD
ONE TELLS HOW AT CHRIST'S SUFFERING THE WAN MOON
BENT BACK HER STEPS AND SHADOW'D O'ER THE SUN
WITH INTERVENIENT DISK AS SHE WITHDREW
ANOTHER HOW THE LIGHT SHROUDED ITSELF
WITHIN ITS TABERNACLE AND LEFT DARK
THE SPANIARD AND THE INDIAN WITH THE JEW
SUCH FABLES FLORENCE IN HER PULPIT HEARS
BANDIED ABOUT MORE FREQUENT THAN THE NAMES
OF BINDI AND OF LAPI IN HER STREETS
THE SHEEP MEANWHILE POOR WITLESS ONES RETURN
FROM PASTURE FED WITH WIND AND WHAT AVAILS
FOR THEIR EXCUSE THEY DO NOT SEE THEIR HARM
CHRIST SAID NOT TO HIS FIRST CONVENTICLE
'GO FORTH AND PREACH IMPOSTURES TO THE WORLD
BUT GAVE THEM TRUTH TO BUILD ON AND THE SOUND
WAS MIGHTY ON THEIR LIPS NOR NEEDED THEY
BESIDE THE GOSPEL OTHER SPEAR OR SHIELD
TO AID THEM IN THEIR WARFARE FOR THE FAITH
THE PREACHER NOW PROVIDES HIMSELF WITH STORE
OF JESTS AND GIBES AND SO THERE BE NO LACK
OF LAUGHTER WHILE HE VENTS THEM HIS BIG COWL
DISTENDS AND HE HAS WON THE MEED HE SOUGHT
COULD BUT THE VULGAR CATCH A GLIMPSE THE WHILE
OF THAT DARK BIRD WHICH NESTLES IN HIS HOOD
THEY SCARCE WOULD WAIT TO HEAR THE BLESSING SAID
WHICH NOW THE DOTARDS HOLD IN SUCH ESTEEM
THAT EVERY COUNTERFEIT WHO SPREADS ABROAD
THE HANDS OF HOLY PROMISE FINDS A THRONG
OF CREDULOUS FOOLS BENEATH
SAINT ANTHONY
FATTENS WITH THIS HIS SWINE AND OTHERS WORSE
THAN SWINE WHO DIET AT HIS LAZY BOARD
PAYING WITH UNSTAMP'D METAL FOR THEIR FARE
BUT FOR WE FAR HAVE WANDER'D LET US SEEK
THE FORWARD PATH AGAIN SO AS THE WAY
BE SHORTEN'D WITH THE TIME
NO MORTAL TONGUE
NOR THOUGHT OF MAN HATH EVER REACH'D SO FAR
THAT OF THESE NATURES HE MIGHT COUNT THE TRIBES
WHAT DANIEL OF THEIR THOUSANDS HATH REVEAL'D
WITH FINITE NUMBER INFINITE CONCEALS
THE FOUNTAIN AT WHOSE SOURCE THESE DRINK THEIR BEAMS
WITH LIGHT SUPPLIES THEM IN AS MANY MODES
AS THERE ARE SPLENDOURS THAT IT SHINES ON EACH
ACCORDING TO THE VIRTUE IT CONCEIVES
DIFFERING IN LOVE AND SWEET AFFECTION
LOOK THEN HOW LOFTY AND HOW HUGE IN BREADTH
THE' ETERNAL MIGHT WHICH BROKEN AND DISPERS'D
OVER SUCH COUNTLESS MIRRORS YET REMAINS
WHOLE IN ITSELF AND ONE AS AT THE FIRST
CANTO XXX
NOON'S FERVID HOUR PERCHANCE SIX THOUSAND MILES
FROM HENCE IS DISTANT AND THE SHADOWY CONE
ALMOST TO LEVEL ON OUR EARTH DECLINES
WHEN FROM THE MIDMOST OF THIS BLUE ABYSS
BY TURNS SOME STAR IS TO OUR VISION LOST
AND STRAIGHTWAY AS THE HANDMAID OF THE SUN
PUTS FORTH HER RADIANT BROW ALL LIGHT BY LIGHT
FADE AND THE SPANGLED FIRMAMENT SHUTS IN
E'EN TO THE LOVELIEST OF THE GLITTERING THRONG
THUS VANISH'D GRADUALLY FROM MY SIGHT
THE TRIUMPH WHICH PLAYS EVER ROUND THE POINT
THAT OVERCAME ME SEEMING FOR IT DID
ENGIRT BY THAT IT GIRDETH
WHEREFORE LOVE
WITH LOSS OF OTHER OBJECT FORC'D ME BEND
MINE EYES ON BEATRICE ONCE AGAIN
IF ALL THAT HITHERTO IS TOLD OF HER
WERE IN ONE PRAISE CONCLUDED 'T WERE TOO WEAK
TO FURNISH OUT THIS TURN
MINE EYES DID LOOK
ON BEAUTY SUCH AS I BELIEVE IN SOOTH
NOT MERELY TO EXCEED OUR HUMAN BUT
THAT SAVE ITS MAKER NONE CAN TO THE FULL
ENJOY IT
AT THIS POINT O'ERPOWER'D I FAIL
UNEQUAL TO MY THEME AS NEVER BARD
OF BUSKIN OR OF SOCK HATH FAIL'D BEFORE
FOR AS THE SUN DOTH TO THE FEEBLEST SIGHT
E'EN SO REMEMBRANCE OF THAT WITCHING SMILE
HATH DISPOSSESS MY SPIRIT OF ITSELF
NOT FROM THAT DAY WHEN ON THIS EARTH I FIRST
BEHELD HER CHARMS UP TO THAT VIEW OF THEM
HAVE I WITH SONG APPLAUSIVE EVER CEAS'D
TO FOLLOW BUT NOT FOLLOW THEM NO MORE
MY COURSE HERE BOUNDED AS EACH ARTIST'S IS
WHEN IT DOTH TOUCH THE LIMIT OF HIS SKILL
SHE SUCH AS I BEQUEATH HER TO THE BRUIT
OF LOUDER TRUMP THAN MINE WHICH HASTENETH ON
URGING ITS ARDUOUS MATTER TO THE CLOSE
HER WORDS RESUM'D IN GESTURE AND IN VOICE
RESEMBLING ONE ACCUSTOM'D TO COMMAND
FORTH FROM THE LAST CORPOREAL ARE WE COME
INTO THE HEAV'N THAT IS UNBODIED LIGHT
LIGHT INTELLECTUAL REPLETE WITH LOVE
LOVE OF TRUE HAPPINESS REPLETE WITH JOY
JOY THAT TRANSCENDS ALL SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT
HERE SHALT THOU LOOK ON EITHER MIGHTY HOST
OF PARADISE AND ONE IN THAT ARRAY
WHICH IN THE FINAL JUDGMENT THOU SHALT SEE
AS WHEN THE LIGHTNING IN A SUDDEN SPLEEN
UNFOLDED DASHES FROM THE BLINDING EYES
THE VISIVE SPIRITS DAZZLED AND BEDIMM'D
SO ROUND ABOUT ME FULMINATING STREAMS
OF LIVING RADIANCE PLAY'D AND LEFT ME SWATH'D
AND VEIL'D IN DENSE IMPENETRABLE BLAZE
SUCH WEAL IS IN THE LOVE THAT STILLS THIS HEAV'N
FOR ITS OWN FLAME THE TORCH THIS FITTING EVER
NO SOONER TO MY LIST'NING EAR HAD COME
THE BRIEF ASSURANCE THAN I UNDERSTOOD
NEW VIRTUE INTO ME INFUS'D AND SIGHT
KINDLED AFRESH WITH VIGOUR TO SUSTAIN
EXCESS OF LIGHT HOWEVER PURE
I LOOK'D
AND IN THE LIKENESS OF A RIVER SAW
LIGHT FLOWING FROM WHOSE AMBER SEEMING WAVES
FLASH'D UP EFFULGENCE AS THEY GLIDED ON
'TWIXT BANKS ON EITHER SIDE PAINTED WITH SPRING
INCREDIBLE HOW FAIR AND FROM THE TIDE
THERE EVER AND ANON OUTSTARTING FLEW
SPARKLES INSTINCT WITH LIFE AND IN THE FLOW'RS
DID SET THEM LIKE TO RUBIES CHAS'D IN GOLD
THEN AS IF DRUNK WITH ODORS PLUNG'D AGAIN
INTO THE WONDROUS FLOOD FROM WHICH AS ONE
RE'ENTER'D STILL ANOTHER ROSE
THE THIRST
OF KNOWLEDGE HIGH WHEREBY THOU ART INFLAM'D
TO SEARCH THE MEANING OF WHAT HERE THOU SEEST
THE MORE IT WARMS THEE PLEASES ME THE MORE
BUT FIRST BEHOOVES THEE OF THIS WATER DRINK
OR ERE THAT LONGING BE ALLAY'D SO SPAKE
THE DAY STAR OF MINE EYES THEN THUS SUBJOIN'D
THIS STREAM AND THESE FORTH ISSUING FROM ITS GULF
AND DIVING BACK A LIVING TOPAZ EACH
WITH ALL THIS LAUGHTER ON ITS BLOOMY SHORES
ARE BUT A PREFACE SHADOWY OF THE TRUTH
THEY EMBLEM NOT THAT IN THEMSELVES THE THINGS
ARE CRUDE BUT ON THY PART IS THE DEFECT
FOR THAT THY VIEWS NOT YET ASPIRE SO HIGH
NEVER DID BABE THAT HAD OUTSLEPT HIS WONT
RUSH WITH SUCH EAGER STRAINING TO THE MILK
AS I TOWARD THE WATER BENDING ME
TO MAKE THE BETTER MIRRORS OF MINE EYES
IN THE REFINING WAVE AND AS THE EAVES
OF MINE EYELIDS DID DRINK OF IT FORTHWITH
SEEM'D IT UNTO ME TURN'D FROM LENGTH TO ROUND
THEN AS A TROOP OF MASKERS WHEN THEY PUT
THEIR VIZORS OFF LOOK OTHER THAN BEFORE
THE COUNTERFEITED SEMBLANCE THROWN ASIDE
SO INTO GREATER JUBILEE WERE CHANG'D
THOSE FLOWERS AND SPARKLES AND DISTINCT I SAW
BEFORE ME EITHER COURT OF HEAV'N DISPLAC'D
O PRIME ENLIGHTENER THOU WHO CRAV'ST ME STRENGTH
ON THE HIGH TRIUMPH OF THY REALM TO GAZE
GRANT VIRTUE NOW TO UTTER WHAT I KENN'D
THERE IS IN HEAV'N A LIGHT WHOSE GOODLY SHINE
MAKES THE CREATOR VISIBLE TO ALL
CREATED THAT IN SEEING HIM ALONE
HAVE PEACE AND IN A CIRCLE SPREADS SO FAR
THAT THE CIRCUMFERENCE WERE TOO LOOSE A ZONE
TO GIRDLE IN THE SUN
ALL IS ONE BEAM
REFLECTED FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE FIRST
THAT MOVES WHICH BEING HENCE AND VIGOUR TAKES
AND AS SOME CLIFF THAT FROM THE BOTTOM EYES
ITS IMAGE MIRROR'D IN THE CRYSTAL FLOOD
AS IF 'T ADMIRE ITS BRAVE APPARELING
OF VERDURE AND OF FLOWERS SO ROUND ABOUT
EYEING THE LIGHT ON MORE THAN MILLION THRONES
STOOD EMINENT WHATEVER FROM OUR EARTH
HAS TO THE SKIES RETURN'D
HOW WIDE THE LEAVES
EXTENDED TO THEIR UTMOST OF THIS ROSE
WHOSE LOWEST STEP EMBOSOMS SUCH A SPACE
OF AMPLE RADIANCE YET NOR AMPLITUDE
NOR HEIGHT IMPEDED BUT MY VIEW WITH EASE
TOOK IN THE FULL DIMENSIONS OF THAT JOY
NEAR OR REMOTE WHAT THERE AVAILS WHERE GOD
IMMEDIATE RULES AND NATURE AWED SUSPENDS
HER SWAY INTO THE YELLOW OF THE ROSE
PERENNIAL WHICH IN BRIGHT EXPANSIVENESS
LAYS FORTH ITS GRADUAL BLOOMING REDOLENT
OF PRAISES TO THE NEVER WINT'RING SUN
AS ONE WHO FAIN WOULD SPEAK YET HOLDS HIS PEACE
BEATRICE LED ME AND BEHOLD SHE SAID
THIS FAIR ASSEMBLAGE STOLES OF SNOWY WHITE
HOW NUMBERLESS THE CITY WHERE WE DWELL
BEHOLD HOW VAST AND THESE OUR SEATS SO THRONG'D
FEW NOW ARE WANTING HERE IN THAT PROUD STALL
ON WHICH THE CROWN ALREADY O'ER ITS STATE
SUSPENDED HOLDS THINE EYES OR ERE THYSELF
MAYST AT THE WEDDING SUP SHALL REST THE SOUL
OF THE GREAT HARRY HE WHO BY THE WORLD
AUGUSTAS HAIL'D TO ITALY MUST COME
BEFORE HER DAY BE RIPE
BUT YE ARE SICK
AND IN YOUR TETCHY WANTONNESS AS BLIND
AS IS THE BANTLING THAT OF HUNGER DIES
AND DRIVES AWAY THE NURSE
NOR MAY IT BE
THAT HE WHO IN THE SACRED FORUM SWAYS
OPENLY OR IN SECRET SHALL WITH HIM
ACCORDANT WALK WHOM GOD WILL NOT ENDURE
I' TH' HOLY OFFICE LONG BUT THRUST HIM DOWN
TO SIMON MAGUS WHERE MAGNA'S PRIEST
WILL SINK BENEATH HIM SUCH WILL BE HIS MEED
CANTO XXXI
IN FASHION AS A SNOW WHITE ROSE LAY THEN
BEFORE MY VIEW THE SAINTLY MULTITUDE
WHICH IN HIS OWN BLOOD CHRIST ESPOUS'D
MEANWHILE
THAT OTHER HOST THAT SOAR ALOFT TO GAZE
AND CELEBRATE HIS GLORY WHOM THEY LOVE
HOVER'D AROUND AND LIKE A TROOP OF BEES
AMID THE VERNAL SWEETS ALIGHTING NOW
NOW CLUSTERING WHERE THEIR FRAGRANT LABOUR GLOWS
FLEW DOWNWARD TO THE MIGHTY FLOW'R OR ROSE
FROM THE REDUNDANT PETALS STREAMING BACK
UNTO THE STEADFAST DWELLING OF THEIR JOY
FACES HAD THEY OF FLAME AND WINGS OF GOLD
THE REST WAS WHITER THAN THE DRIVEN SNOW
AND AS THEY FLITTED DOWN INTO THE FLOWER
FROM RANGE TO RANGE FANNING THEIR PLUMY LOINS
WHISPER'D THE PEACE AND ARDOUR WHICH THEY WON
FROM THAT SOFT WINNOWING
SHADOW NONE THE VAST
INTERPOSITION OF SUCH NUMEROUS FLIGHT
CAST FROM ABOVE UPON THE FLOWER OR VIEW
OBSTRUCTED AUGHT
FOR THROUGH THE UNIVERSE
WHEREVER MERITED CELESTIAL LIGHT
GLIDES FREELY AND NO OBSTACLE PREVENTS
ALL THERE WHO REIGN IN SAFETY AND IN BLISS
AGES LONG PAST OR NEW ON ONE SOLE MARK
THEIR LOVE AND VISION FIX'D
O TRINAL BEAM
OF INDIVIDUAL STAR THAT CHARMST THEM THUS
VOUCHSAFE ONE GLANCE TO GILD OUR STORM BELOW
IF THE GRIM BROOD FROM ARCTIC SHORES THAT ROAM'D
WHERE HELICE FOREVER AS SHE WHEELS
SPARKLES A MOTHER'S FONDNESS ON HER SON
STOOD IN MUTE WONDER 'MID THE WORKS OF ROME
WHEN TO THEIR VIEW THE LATERAN AROSE
IN GREATNESS MORE THAN EARTHLY I WHO THEN
FROM HUMAN TO DIVINE HAD PAST FROM TIME
UNTO ETERNITY AND OUT OF FLORENCE
TO JUSTICE AND TO TRUTH HOW MIGHT I CHOOSE
BUT MARVEL TOO 'TWIXT GLADNESS AND AMAZE
IN SOOTH NO WILL HAD I TO UTTER AUGHT
OR HEAR
AND AS A PILGRIM WHEN HE RESTS
WITHIN THE TEMPLE OF HIS VOW LOOKS ROUND
IN BREATHLESS AWE AND HOPES SOME TIME TO TELL
OF ALL ITS GOODLY STATE E'EN SO MINE EYES
COURS'D UP AND DOWN ALONG THE LIVING LIGHT
NOW LOW AND NOW ALOFT AND NOW AROUND
VISITING EVERY STEP
LOOKS I BEHELD
WHERE CHARITY IN SOFT PERSUASION SAT
SMILES FROM WITHIN AND RADIANCE FROM ABOVE
AND IN EACH GESTURE GRACE AND HONOUR HIGH
SO ROV'D MY KEN AND ITS GENERAL FORM
ALL PARADISE SURVEY'D WHEN ROUND I TURN'D
WITH PURPOSE OF MY LADY TO INQUIRE
ONCE MORE OF THINGS THAT HELD MY THOUGHT SUSPENSE
BUT ANSWER FOUND FROM OTHER THAN I WEEN'D
FOR BEATRICE WHEN I THOUGHT TO SEE
I SAW INSTEAD A SENIOR AT MY SIDE
ROB'D AS THE REST IN GLORY
JOY BENIGN
GLOW'D IN HIS EYE AND O'ER HIS CHEEK DIFFUS'D
WITH GESTURES SUCH AS SPAKE A FATHER'S LOVE
AND WHITHER IS SHE VANISH'D STRAIGHT I ASK'D
BY BEATRICE SUMMON'D HE REPLIED
I COME TO AID THY WISH
LOOKING ALOFT
TO THE THIRD CIRCLE FROM THE HIGHEST THERE
BEHOLD HER ON THE THRONE WHEREIN HER MERIT
HATH PLAC'D HER ANSWERING NOT MINE EYES I RAIS'D
AND SAW HER WHERE ALOOF SHE SAT HER BROW
A WREATH REFLECTING OF ETERNAL BEAMS
NOT FROM THE CENTRE OF THE SEA SO FAR
UNTO THE REGION OF THE HIGHEST THUNDER
AS WAS MY KEN FROM HERS AND YET THE FORM
CAME THROUGH THAT MEDIUM DOWN UNMIX'D AND PURE
O LADY THOU IN WHOM MY HOPES HAVE REST
WHO FOR MY SAFETY HAST NOT SCORN'D IN HELL
TO LEAVE THE TRACES OF THY FOOTSTEPS MARK'D
FOR ALL MINE EYES HAVE SEEN I TO THY POWER
AND GOODNESS VIRTUE OWE AND GRACE
OF SLAVE
THOU HAST TO FREEDOM BROUGHT ME AND NO MEANS
FOR MY DELIVERANCE APT HAST LEFT UNTRIED
THY LIBERAL BOUNTY STILL TOWARD ME KEEP
THAT WHEN MY SPIRIT WHICH THOU MADEST WHOLE
IS LOOSEN'D FROM THIS BODY IT MAY FIND
FAVOUR WITH THEE SO I MY SUIT PREFERR'D
AND SHE SO DISTANT AS APPEAR'D LOOK'D DOWN
AND SMIL'D THEN TOW'RDS TH' ETERNAL FOUNTAIN TURN'D
AND THUS THE SENIOR HOLY AND REVER'D
THAT THOU AT LENGTH MAYST HAPPILY CONCLUDE
THY VOYAGE TO WHICH END I WAS DISPATCH'D
BY SUPPLICATION MOV'D AND HOLY LOVE
LET THY UPSOARING VISION RANGE AT LARGE
THIS GARDEN THROUGH FOR SO BY RAY DIVINE
KINDLED THY KEN A HIGHER FLIGHT SHALL MOUNT
AND FROM HEAV'N'S QUEEN WHOM FERVENT I ADORE
ALL GRACIOUS AID BEFRIEND US FOR THAT I
AM HER OWN FAITHFUL BERNARD LIKE A WIGHT
WHO HAPLY FROM CROATIA WENDS TO SEE
OUR VERONICA AND THE WHILE 'T IS SHOWN
HANGS OVER IT WITH NEVER SATED GAZE
AND ALL THAT HE HATH HEARD REVOLVING SAITH
UNTO HIMSELF IN THOUGHT AND DIDST THOU LOOK
E'EN THUS O JESUS MY TRUE LORD AND GOD
AND WAS THIS SEMBLANCE THINE SO GAZ'D I THEN
ADORING FOR THE CHARITY OF HIM
WHO MUSING IN THE WORLD THAT PEACE ENJOY'D
STOOD LIVELY BEFORE ME
CHILD OF GRACE
THUS HE BEGAN THOU SHALT NOT KNOWLEDGE GAIN
OF THIS GLAD BEING IF THINE EYES ARE HELD
STILL IN THIS DEPTH BELOW
BUT SEARCH AROUND
THE CIRCLES TO THE FURTHEST TILL THOU SPY
SEATED IN STATE THE QUEEN THAT OF THIS REALM
IS SOVRAN STRAIGHT MINE EYES I RAIS'D AND BRIGHT
AS AT THE BIRTH OF MORN THE EASTERN CLIME
ABOVE TH' HORIZON WHERE THE SUN DECLINES
TO MINE EYES THAT UPWARD AS FROM VALE
TO MOUNTAIN SPED AT TH' EXTREME BOUND A PART
EXCELL'D IN LUSTRE ALL THE FRONT OPPOS'D
AND AS THE GLOW BURNS RUDDIEST O'ER THE WAVE
THAT WAITS THE SLOPING BEAM WHICH PHAETON
ILL KNEW TO GUIDE AND ON EACH PART THE LIGHT
DIMINISH'D FADES INTENSEST IN THE MIDST
SO BURN'D THE PEACEFUL ORIFLAME AND SLACK'D
ON EVERY SIDE THE LIVING FLAME DECAY'D
AND IN THAT MIDST THEIR SPORTIVE PENNONS WAV'D
THOUSANDS OF ANGELS IN RESPLENDENCE EACH
DISTINCT AND QUAINT ADORNMENT
AT THEIR GLEE
AND CAROL SMIL'D THE LOVELY ONE OF HEAV'N
THAT JOY WAS IN THE EYES OF ALL THE BLEST
HAD I A TONGUE IN ELOQUENCE AS RICH
AS IS THE COLOURING IN FANCY'S LOOM
'T WERE ALL TOO POOR TO UTTER THE LEAST PART
OF THAT ENCHANTMENT
WHEN HE SAW MINE EYES
INTENT ON HER THAT CHARM'D HIM BERNARD GAZ'D
WITH SO EXCEEDING FONDNESS AS INFUS'D
ARDOUR INTO MY BREAST UNFELT BEFORE
CANTO XXXII
FREELY THE SAGE THOUGH WRAPT IN MUSINGS HIGH
ASSUM'D THE TEACHER'S PART AND MILD BEGAN
THE WOUND THAT MARY CLOS'D SHE OPEN'D FIRST
WHO SITS SO BEAUTIFUL AT MARY'S FEET
THE THIRD IN ORDER UNDERNEATH HER LO
RACHEL WITH BEATRICE
SARAH NEXT
JUDITH REBECCA AND THE GLEANER MAID
MEEK ANCESTRESS OF HIM WHO SANG THE SONGS
OF SORE REPENTANCE IN HIS SORROWFUL MOOD
ALL AS I NAME THEM DOWN FROM DEAF TO LEAF
ARE IN GRADATION THRONED ON THE ROSE
AND FROM THE SEVENTH STEP SUCCESSIVELY
ADOWN THE BREATHING TRESSES OF THE FLOW'R
STILL DOTH THE FILE OF HEBREW DAMES PROCEED
FOR THESE ARE A PARTITION WALL WHEREBY
THE SACRED STAIRS ARE SEVER'D AS THE FAITH
IN CHRIST DIVIDES THEM
ON THIS PART WHERE BLOOMS
EACH LEAF IN FULL MATURITY ARE SET
SUCH AS IN CHRIST OR ERE HE CAME BELIEV'D
ON TH' OTHER WHERE AN INTERSECTED SPACE
YET SHOWS THE SEMICIRCLE VOID ABIDE
ALL THEY WHO LOOK'D TO CHRIST ALREADY COME
AND AS OUR LADY ON HER GLORIOUS STOOL
AND THEY WHO ON THEIR STOOLS BENEATH HER SIT
THIS WAY DISTINCTION MAKE E'EN SO ON HIS
THE MIGHTY BAPTIST THAT WAY MARKS THE LINE
HE WHO ENDUR'D THE DESERT AND THE PAINS
OF MARTYRDOM AND FOR TWO YEARS OF HELL
YET STILL CONTINUED HOLY AND BENEATH
AUGUSTIN FRANCIS BENEDICT AND THE REST
THUS FAR FROM ROUND TO ROUND
SO HEAV'N'S DECREE
FORECASTS THIS GARDEN EQUALLY TO FILL
WITH FAITH IN EITHER VIEW PAST OR TO COME
LEARN TOO THAT DOWNWARD FROM THE STEP WHICH CLEAVES
MIDWAY THE TWAIN COMPARTMENTS NONE THERE ARE
WHO PLACE OBTAIN FOR MERIT OF THEIR OWN
BUT HAVE THROUGH OTHERS' MERIT BEEN ADVANC'D
ON SET CONDITIONS SPIRITS ALL RELEAS'D
ERE FOR THEMSELVES THEY HAD THE POWER TO CHOOSE
AND IF THOU MARK AND LISTEN TO THEM WELL
THEIR CHILDISH LOOKS AND VOICE DECLARE AS MUCH
HERE SILENT AS THOU ART I KNOW THY DOUBT
AND GLADLY WILL I LOOSE THE KNOT WHEREIN
THY SUBTLE THOUGHTS HAVE BOUND THEE
FROM THIS REALM
EXCLUDED CHALICE NO ENTRANCE HERE MAY FIND
NO MORE SHALL HUNGER THIRST OR SORROW CAN
A LAW IMMUTABLE HATH ESTABLISH'D ALL
NOR IS THERE AUGHT THOU SEEST THAT DOTH NOT FIT
EXACTLY AS THE FINGER TO THE RING
IT IS NOT THEREFORE WITHOUT CAUSE THAT THESE
O'ERSPEEDY COMERS TO IMMORTAL LIFE
ARE DIFFERENT IN THEIR SHARES OF EXCELLENCE
OUR SOVRAN LORD THAT SETTLETH THIS ESTATE
IN LOVE AND IN DELIGHT SO ABSOLUTE
THAT WISH CAN DARE NO FURTHER EVERY SOUL
CREATED IN HIS JOYOUS SIGHT TO DWELL
WITH GRACE AT PLEASURE VARIOUSLY ENDOWS
AND FOR A PROOF TH' EFFECT MAY WELL SUFFICE
AND 'T IS MOREOVER MOST EXPRESSLY MARK'D
IN HOLY SCRIPTURE WHERE THE TWINS ARE SAID
TO HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE WOMB
THEREFORE AS GRACE
INWEAVES THE CORONET SO EVERY BROW
WEARETH ITS PROPER HUE OF ORIENT LIGHT
AND MERELY IN RESPECT TO HIS PRIME GIFT
NOT IN REWARD OF MERITORIOUS DEED
HATH EACH HIS SEVERAL DEGREE ASSIGN'D
IN EARLY TIMES WITH THEIR OWN INNOCENCE
MORE WAS NOT WANTING THAN THE PARENTS' FAITH
TO SAVE THEM THOSE FIRST AGES PAST BEHOOV'D
THAT CIRCUMCISION IN THE MALES SHOULD IMP
THE FLIGHT OF INNOCENT WINGS BUT SINCE THE DAY
OF GRACE HATH COME WITHOUT BAPTISMAL RITES
IN CHRIST ACCOMPLISH'D INNOCENCE HERSELF
MUST LINGER YET BELOW
NOW RAISE THY VIEW
UNTO THE VISAGE MOST RESEMBLING CHRIST
FOR IN HER SPLENDOUR ONLY SHALT THOU WIN
THE POW'R TO LOOK ON HIM FORTHWITH I SAW
SUCH FLOODS OF GLADNESS ON HER VISAGE SHOWER'D
FROM HOLY SPIRITS WINGING THAT PROFOUND
THAT WHATSOEVER I HAD YET BEHELD
HAD NOT SO MUCH SUSPENDED ME WITH WONDER
OR SHOWN ME SUCH SIMILITUDE OF GOD
AND HE WHO HAD TO HER DESCENDED ONCE
ON EARTH NOW HAIL'D IN HEAV'N AND ON POIS'D WING
AVE MARIA GRATIA PLENA SANG
TO WHOSE SWEET ANTHEM ALL THE BLISSFUL COURT
FROM ALL PARTS ANSW'RING RANG THAT HOLIER JOY
BROODED THE DEEP SERENE
FATHER REVER'D
WHO DEIGN'ST FOR ME TO QUIT THE PLEASANT PLACE
WHEREIN THOU SITTEST BY ETERNAL LOT
SAY WHO THAT ANGEL IS THAT WITH SUCH GLEE
BEHOLDS OUR QUEEN AND SO ENAMOUR'D GLOWS
OF HER HIGH BEAUTY THAT ALL FIRE HE SEEMS
SO I AGAIN RESORTED TO THE LORE
OF MY WISE TEACHER HE WHOM MARY'S CHARMS
EMBELLISH'D AS THE SUN THE MORNING STAR
WHO THUS IN ANSWER SPAKE IN HIM ARE SUMM'D
WHATEVER OF BUXOMNESS AND FREE DELIGHT
MAY BE IN SPIRIT OR IN ANGEL MET
AND SO BESEEMS FOR THAT HE BARE THE PALM
DOWN UNTO MARY WHEN THE SON OF GOD
VOUCHSAF'D TO CLOTHE HIM IN TERRESTRIAL WEEDS
NOW LET THINE EYES WAIT HEEDFUL ON MY WORDS
AND NOTE THOU OF THIS JUST AND PIOUS REALM
THE CHIEFEST NOBLES
THOSE HIGHEST IN BLISS
THE TWAIN ON EACH HAND NEXT OUR EMPRESS THRON'D
ARE AS IT WERE TWO ROOTS UNTO THIS ROSE
HE TO THE LEFT THE PARENT WHOSE RASH TASTE
PROVES BITTER TO HIS SEED AND ON THE RIGHT
THAT ANCIENT FATHER OF THE HOLY CHURCH
INTO WHOSE KEEPING CHRIST DID GIVE THE KEYS
OF THIS SWEET FLOW'R NEAR WHOM BEHOLD THE SEER
THAT ERE HE DIED SAW ALL THE GRIEVOUS TIMES
OF THE FAIR BRIDE WHO WITH THE LANCE AND NAILS
WAS WON
AND NEAR UNTO THE OTHER RESTS
THE LEADER UNDER WHOM ON MANNA FED
TH' UNGRATEFUL NATION FICKLE AND PERVERSE
ON TH' OTHER PART FACING TO PETER LO
WHERE ANNA SITS SO WELL CONTENT TO LOOK
ON HER LOV'D DAUGHTER THAT WITH MOVELESS EYE
SHE CHANTS THE LOUD HOSANNA WHILE OPPOS'D
TO THE FIRST FATHER OF YOUR MORTAL KIND
IS LUCIA AT WHOSE HEST THY LADY SPED
WHEN ON THE EDGE OF RUIN CLOS'D THINE EYE
BUT FOR THE VISION HASTENETH SO AN END
HERE BREAK WE OFF AS THE GOOD WORKMAN DOTH
THAT SHAPES THE CLOAK ACCORDING TO THE CLOTH
AND TO THE PRIMAL LOVE OUR KEN SHALL RISE
THAT THOU MAYST PENETRATE THE BRIGHTNESS FAR
AS SIGHT CAN BEAR THEE

FORERUN THE ASKING
WHATSOE'ER MAY BE
OF EXCELLENCE IN CREATURE PITY MILD
RELENTING MERCY LARGE MUNIFICENCE

FROM THE WORLD'S LOWEST GAP UNTO THIS HEIGHT
SUPPLIANT TO THEE HE KNEELS IMPLORING GRACE
FOR VIRTUE YET MORE HIGH TO LIFT HIS KEN
TOWARD THE BLISS SUPREME
AND I WHO NE'ER
COVETED SIGHT MORE FONDLY FOR MYSELF
THAN NOW FOR HIM MY PRAYERS TO THEE PREFER
AND PRAY THEY BE NOT SCANT THAT THOU WOULDST DRIVE
EACH CLOUD OF HIS MORTALITY AWAY
THAT ON THE SOVRAN PLEASURE HE MAY GAZE
THIS ALSO I ENTREAT OF THEE O QUEEN
WHO CANST DO WHAT THOU WILT THAT IN HIM THOU
WOULDST AFTER ALL HE HATH BEHELD PRESERVE
AFFECTION SOUND AND HUMAN PASSIONS QUELL
LO WHERE WITH BEATRICE MANY A SAINT
STRETCH THEIR CLASP'D HANDS IN FURTHERANCE OF MY SUIT
THE EYES THAT HEAV'N WITH LOVE AND AWE REGARDS
FIX'D ON THE SUITOR WITNESS'D HOW BENIGN
SHE LOOKS ON PIOUS PRAY'RS THEN FASTEN'D THEY
ON TH' EVERLASTING LIGHT WHEREIN NO EYE
OF CREATURE AS MAY WELL BE THOUGHT SO FAR
CAN TRAVEL INWARD
I MEANWHILE WHO DREW
NEAR TO THE LIMIT WHERE ALL WISHES END
THE ARDOUR OF MY WISH FOR SO BEHOOVED
ENDED WITHIN ME
BECK'NING SMIL'D THE SAGE
THAT I SHOULD LOOK ALOFT BUT ERE HE BADE
ALREADY OF MYSELF ALOFT I LOOK'D
FOR VISUAL STRENGTH REFINING MORE AND MORE
BARE ME INTO THE RAY AUTHENTICAL
OF SOVRAN LIGHT
THENCEFORWARD WHAT I SAW
WAS NOT FOR WORDS TO SPEAK NOR MEMORY'S SELF
TO STAND AGAINST SUCH OUTRAGE ON HER SKILL
AS ONE WHO FROM A DREAM AWAKEN'D STRAIGHT
ALL HE HATH SEEN FORGETS YET STILL RETAINS
IMPRESSION OF THE FEELING IN HIS DREAM
E'EN SUCH AM I FOR ALL THE VISION DIES
AS 'T WERE AWAY AND YET THE SENSE OF SWEET
THAT SPRANG FROM IT STILL TRICKLES IN MY HEART
THUS IN THE SUN THAW IS THE SNOW UNSEAL'D
THUS IN THE WINDS ON FLITTING LEAVES WAS LOST
THE SYBIL'S SENTENCE
O ETERNAL BEAM
WHOSE HEIGHT WHAT REACH OF MORTAL THOUGHT MAY SOAR
YIELD ME AGAIN SOME LITTLE PARTICLE
OF WHAT THOU THEN APPEAREDST GIVE MY TONGUE
POWER BUT TO LEAVE ONE SPARKLE OF THY GLORY
UNTO THE RACE TO COME THAT SHALL NOT LOSE
THY TRIUMPH WHOLLY IF THOU WAKEN AUGHT
OF MEMORY IN ME AND ENDURE TO HEAR
THE RECORD SOUND IN THIS UNEQUAL STRAIN
SUCH KEENNESS FROM THE LIVING RAY I MET
THAT IF MINE EYES HAD TURN'D AWAY METHINKS
I HAD BEEN LOST BUT SO EMBOLDEN'D ON
I PASS'D AS I REMEMBER TILL MY VIEW
HOVER'D THE BRINK OF DREAD INFINITUDE
O GRACE UNENVYING OF THY BOON THAT GAV'ST
BOLDNESS TO FIX SO EARNESTLY MY KEN
ON TH' EVERLASTING SPLENDOUR THAT I LOOK'D
WHILE SIGHT WAS UNCONSUM'D AND IN THAT DEPTH
SAW IN ONE VOLUME CLASP'D OF LOVE WHATEVER
THE UNIVERSE UNFOLDS ALL PROPERTIES
OF SUBSTANCE AND OF ACCIDENT BEHELD
COMPOUNDED YET ONE INDIVIDUAL LIGHT
THE WHOLE
AND OF SUCH BOND METHINKS I SAW
THE UNIVERSAL FORM FOR THAT WHENEVER
I DO BUT SPEAK OF IT MY SOUL DILATES
BEYOND HER PROPER SELF AND TILL I SPEAK
ONE MOMENT SEEMS A LONGER LETHARGY
THAN FIVE AND TWENTY AGES HAD APPEAR'D
TO THAT EMPRIZE THAT FIRST MADE NEPTUNE WONDER
AT ARGO'S SHADOW DARKENING ON HIS FLOOD
WITH FIXED HEED SUSPENSE AND MOTIONLESS
WOND'RING I GAZ'D AND ADMIRATION STILL
WAS KINDLED AS I GAZ'D
IT MAY NOT BE
THAT ONE WHO LOOKS UPON THAT LIGHT CAN TURN
TO OTHER OBJECT WILLINGLY HIS VIEW
FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT WILL MAY COVET THERE
IS SUMM'D AND ALL ELSEWHERE DEFECTIVE FOUND
COMPLETE
MY TONGUE SHALL UTTER NOW NO MORE
E'EN WHAT REMEMBRANCE KEEPS THAN COULD THE BABE'S
THAT YET IS MOISTEN'D AT HIS MOTHER'S BREAST
NOT THAT THE SEMBLANCE OF THE LIVING LIGHT
WAS CHANG'D THAT EVER AS AT FIRST REMAIN'D
BUT THAT MY VISION QUICKENING IN THAT SOLE
APPEARANCE STILL NEW MIRACLES DESCRY'D
AND TOIL'D ME WITH THE CHANGE
IN THAT ABYSS
OF RADIANCE CLEAR AND LOFTY SEEM'D METHOUGHT
THREE ORBS OF TRIPLE HUE CLIPT IN ONE BOUND
AND FROM ANOTHER ONE REFLECTED SEEM'D
AS RAINBOW IS FROM RAINBOW AND THE THIRD
SEEM'D FIRE BREATH'D EQUALLY FROM BOTH
OH SPEECH
HOW FEEBLE AND HOW FAINT ART THOU TO GIVE
CONCEPTION BIRTH YET THIS TO WHAT I SAW
IS LESS THAN LITTLE
OH ETERNAL LIGHT
SOLE IN THYSELF THAT DWELLST AND OF THYSELF
SOLE UNDERSTOOD PAST PRESENT OR TO COME
THOU SMILEDST ON THAT CIRCLING WHICH IN THEE
SEEM'D AS REFLECTED SPLENDOUR WHILE I MUS'D
FOR I THEREIN METHOUGHT IN ITS OWN HUE
BEHELD OUR IMAGE PAINTED STEADFASTLY
I THEREFORE POR'D UPON THE VIEW
AS ONE
WHO VERS'D IN GEOMETRIC LORE WOULD FAIN
MEASURE THE CIRCLE AND THOUGH PONDERING LONG
AND DEEPLY THAT BEGINNING WHICH HE NEEDS
FINDS NOT E'EN SUCH WAS I INTENT TO SCAN
THE NOVEL WONDER AND TRACE OUT THE FORM
HOW TO THE CIRCLE FITTED AND THEREIN
HOW PLAC'D BUT THE FLIGHT WAS NOT FOR MY WING
HAD NOT A FLASH DARTED ATHWART MY MIND
AND IN THE SPLEEN UNFOLDED WHAT IT SOUGHT
HERE VIGOUR FAIL'D THE TOW'RING FANTASY
BUT YET THE WILL ROLL'D ONWARD LIKE A WHEEL
IN EVEN MOTION BY THE LOVE IMPELL'D

CANTO I
O'ER BETTER WAVES TO SPEED HER RAPID COURSE
THE LIGHT BARK OF MY GENIUS LIFTS THE SAIL
WELL PLEAS'D TO LEAVE SO CRUEL SEA BEHIND
AND OF THAT SECOND REGION WILL I SING
IN WHICH THE HUMAN SPIRIT FROM SINFUL BLOT
IS PURG'D AND FOR ASCENT TO HEAVEN PREPARES
HERE O YE HALLOW'D NINE FOR IN YOUR TRAIN
I FOLLOW HERE THE DEADENED STRAIN REVIVE
NOR LET CALLIOPE REFUSE TO SOUND
A SOMEWHAT HIGHER SONG OF THAT LOUD TONE
WHICH WHEN THE WRETCHED BIRDS OF CHATTERING NOTE
HAD HEARD THEY OF FORGIVENESS LOST ALL HOPE
SWEET HUE OF EASTERN SAPPHIRE THAT WAS SPREAD
O'ER THE SERENE ASPECT OF THE PURE AIR
HIGH UP AS THE FIRST CIRCLE TO MINE EYES
UNWONTED JOY RENEW'D SOON AS I 'SCAP'D
FORTH FROM THE ATMOSPHERE OF DEADLY GLOOM
THAT HAD MINE EYES AND BOSOM FILL'D WITH GRIEF
THE RADIANT PLANET THAT TO LOVE INVITES
MADE ALL THE ORIENT LAUGH AND VEIL'D BENEATH
THE PISCES' LIGHT THAT IN HIS ESCORT CAME
TO THE RIGHT HAND I TURN'D AND FIX'D MY MIND
ON THE' OTHER POLE ATTENTIVE WHERE I SAW
FOUR STARS NE'ER SEEN BEFORE SAVE BY THE KEN
OF OUR FIRST PARENTS
HEAVEN OF THEIR RAYS
SEEM'D JOYOUS
O THOU NORTHERN SITE BEREFT
INDEED AND WIDOW'D SINCE OF THESE DEPRIV'D
AS FROM THIS VIEW I HAD DESISTED STRAIGHT
TURNING A LITTLE TOW'RDS THE OTHER POLE
THERE FROM WHENCE NOW THE WAIN HAD DISAPPEAR'D
I SAW AN OLD MAN STANDING BY MY SIDE
ALONE SO WORTHY OF REV'RENCE IN HIS LOOK
THAT NE'ER FROM SON TO FATHER MORE WAS OW'D
LOW DOWN HIS BEARD AND MIX'D WITH HOARY WHITE
DESCENDED LIKE HIS LOCKS WHICH PARTING FELL
UPON HIS BREAST IN DOUBLE FOLD
THE BEAMS
OF THOSE FOUR LUMINARIES ON HIS FACE
SO BRIGHTLY SHONE AND WITH SUCH RADIANCE CLEAR
DECK'D IT THAT I BEHELD HIM AS THE SUN
SAY WHO ARE YE THAT STEMMING THE BLIND STREAM
FORTH FROM TH' ETERNAL PRISON HOUSE HAVE FLED
HE SPOKE AND MOVED THOSE VENERABLE PLUMES
WHO HATH CONDUCTED OR WITH LANTERN SURE
LIGHTS YOU EMERGING FROM THE DEPTH OF NIGHT
THAT MAKES THE INFERNAL VALLEY EVER BLACK
ARE THE FIRM STATUTES OF THE DREAD ABYSS
BROKEN OR IN HIGH HEAVEN NEW LAWS ORDAIN'D
THAT THUS CONDEMN'D YE TO MY CAVES APPROACH
MY GUIDE THEN LAYING HOLD ON ME BY WORDS
AND INTIMATIONS GIVEN WITH HAND AND HEAD
MADE MY BENT KNEES AND EYE SUBMISSIVE PAY
DUE REVERENCE THEN THUS TO HIM REPLIED
NOT OF MYSELF I COME A DAME FROM HEAVEN
DESCENDING HAD BESOUGHT ME IN MY CHARGE
TO BRING
BUT SINCE THY WILL IMPLIES THAT MORE
OUR TRUE CONDITION I UNFOLD AT LARGE
MINE IS NOT TO DENY THEE THY REQUEST
THIS MORTAL NE'ER HATH SEEN THE FARTHEST GLOOM
BUT ERRING BY HIS FOLLY HAD APPROACH'D
SO NEAR THAT LITTLE SPACE WAS LEFT TO TURN
THEN AS BEFORE I TOLD I WAS DISPATCH'D
TO WORK HIS RESCUE AND NO WAY REMAIN'D
SAVE THIS WHICH I HAVE TA'EN
I HAVE DISPLAY'D
BEFORE HIM ALL THE REGIONS OF THE BAD
AND PURPOSE NOW THOSE SPIRITS TO DISPLAY
THAT UNDER THY COMMAND ARE PURG'D FROM SIN
HOW I HAVE BROUGHT HIM WOULD BE LONG TO SAY
FROM HIGH DESCENDS THE VIRTUE BY WHOSE AID
I TO THY SIGHT AND HEARING HIM HAVE LED
NOW MAY OUR COMING PLEASE THEE
IN THE SEARCH
OF LIBERTY HE JOURNEYS THAT HOW DEAR
THEY KNOW WHO FOR HER SAKE HAVE LIFE REFUS'D
THOU KNOWEST TO WHOM DEATH FOR HER WAS SWEET
IN UTICA WHERE THOU DIDST LEAVE THOSE WEEDS
THAT IN THE LAST GREAT DAY WILL SHINE SO BRIGHT
FOR US THE' ETERNAL EDICTS ARE UNMOV'D
HE BREATHES AND I AM FREE OF MINOS' POWER
ABIDING IN THAT CIRCLE WHERE THE EYES
OF THY CHASTE MARCIA BEAM WHO STILL IN LOOK
PRAYS THEE O HALLOW'D SPIRIT TO OWN HER SHINE
THEN BY HER LOVE WE' IMPLORE THEE LET US PASS
THROUGH THY SEV'N REGIONS FOR WHICH BEST THANKS
I FOR THY FAVOUR WILL TO HER RETURN
IF MENTION THERE BELOW THOU NOT DISDAIN
MARCIA SO PLEASING IN MY SIGHT WAS FOUND
HE THEN TO HIM REJOIN'D WHILE I WAS THERE
THAT ALL SHE ASK'D ME I WAS FAIN TO GRANT
NOW THAT BEYOND THE' ACCURSED STREAM SHE DWELLS
SHE MAY NO LONGER MOVE ME BY THAT LAW
WHICH WAS ORDAIN'D ME WHEN I ISSUED THENCE
NOT SO IF DAME FROM HEAVEN AS THOU SAYST
MOVES AND DIRECTS THEE THEN NO FLATTERY NEEDS
ENOUGH FOR ME THAT IN HER NAME THOU ASK
GO THEREFORE NOW AND WITH A SLENDER REED
SEE THAT THOU DULY GIRD HIM AND HIS FACE
LAVE TILL ALL SORDID STAIN THOU WIPE FROM THENCE
FOR NOT WITH EYE BY ANY CLOUD OBSCUR'D
WOULD IT BE SEEMLY BEFORE HIM TO COME
WHO STANDS THE FOREMOST MINISTER IN HEAVEN
THIS ISLET ALL AROUND THERE FAR BENEATH
WHERE THE WAVE BEATS IT ON THE OOZY BED
PRODUCES STORE OF REEDS
NO OTHER PLANT
COVER'D WITH LEAVES OR HARDEN'D IN ITS STALK
THERE LIVES NOT BENDING TO THE WATER'S SWAY
AFTER THIS WAY RETURN NOT BUT THE SUN
WILL SHOW YOU THAT NOW RISES WHERE TO TAKE
THE MOUNTAIN IN ITS EASIEST ASCENT
HE DISAPPEAR'D AND I MYSELF UPRAIS'D
SPEECHLESS AND TO MY GUIDE RETIRING CLOSE
TOWARD HIM TURN'D MINE EYES
HE THUS BEGAN
MY SON OBSERVANT THOU MY STEPS PURSUE
WE MUST RETREAT TO REARWARD FOR THAT WAY
THE CHAMPAIN TO ITS LOW EXTREME DECLINES
THE DAWN HAD CHAS'D THE MATIN HOUR OF PRIME
WHICH DEAF BEFORE IT SO THAT FROM AFAR
I SPY'D THE TREMBLING OF THE OCEAN STREAM
WE TRAVERS'D THE DESERTED PLAIN AS ONE
WHO WANDER'D FROM HIS TRACK THINKS EVERY STEP
TRODDEN IN VAIN TILL HE REGAIN THE PATH
WHEN WE HAD COME WHERE YET THE TENDER DEW
STROVE WITH THE SUN AND IN A PLACE WHERE FRESH
THE WIND BREATH'D O'ER IT WHILE IT SLOWLY DRIED
BOTH HANDS EXTENDED ON THE WATERY GRASS
MY MASTER PLAC'D IN GRACEFUL ACT AND KIND
WHENCE I OF HIS INTENT BEFORE APPRIZ'D
STRETCH'D OUT TO HIM MY CHEEKS SUFFUS'D WITH TEARS
THERE TO MY VISAGE HE ANEW RESTOR'D
THAT HUE WHICH THE DUN SHADES OF HELL CONCEAL'D
THEN ON THE SOLITARY SHORE ARRIV'D
THAT NEVER SAILING ON ITS WATERS SAW
MAN THAT COULD AFTER MEASURE BACK HIS COURSE
HE GIRT ME IN SUCH MANNER AS HAD PLEAS'D
HIM WHO INSTRUCTED AND O STRANGE TO TELL
AS HE SELECTED EVERY HUMBLE PLANT
WHEREVER ONE WAS PLUCK'D ANOTHER THERE
RESEMBLING STRAIGHTWAY IN ITS PLACE AROSE
CANTO II
NOW HAD THE SUN TO THAT HORIZON REACH'D
THAT COVERS WITH THE MOST EXALTED POINT
OF ITS MERIDIAN CIRCLE SALEM'S WALLS
AND NIGHT THAT OPPOSITE TO HIM HER ORB
SOUNDS FROM THE STREAM OF GANGES ISSUED FORTH
HOLDING THE SCALES THAT FROM HER HANDS ARE DROPP'D
WHEN SHE REIGNS HIGHEST SO THAT WHERE I WAS
AURORA'S WHITE AND VERMEIL TINCTUR'D CHEEK
TO ORANGE TURN'D AS SHE IN AGE INCREAS'D
MEANWHILE WE LINGER'D BY THE WATER'S BRINK
LIKE MEN WHO MUSING ON THEIR ROAD IN THOUGHT
JOURNEY WHILE MOTIONLESS THE BODY RESTS
WHEN LO AS NEAR UPON THE HOUR OF DAWN
THROUGH THE THICK VAPOURS MARS WITH FIERY BEAM
GLARES DOWN IN WEST OVER THE OCEAN FLOOR
SO SEEM'D WHAT ONCE AGAIN I HOPE TO VIEW
A LIGHT SO SWIFTLY COMING THROUGH THE SEA
NO WINGED COURSE MIGHT EQUAL ITS CAREER
FROM WHICH WHEN FOR A SPACE I HAD WITHDRAWN
THINE EYES TO MAKE INQUIRY OF MY GUIDE
AGAIN I LOOK'D AND SAW IT GROWN IN SIZE
AND BRIGHTNESS THOU ON EITHER SIDE APPEAR'D
SOMETHING BUT WHAT I KNEW NOT OF BRIGHT HUE
AND BY DEGREES FROM UNDERNEATH IT CAME
ANOTHER
MY PRECEPTOR SILENT YET
STOOD WHILE THE BRIGHTNESS THAT WE FIRST DISCERN'D
OPEN'D THE FORM OF WINGS THEN WHEN HE KNEW
THE PILOT CRIED ALOUD DOWN DOWN BEND LOW
THY KNEES BEHOLD GOD'S ANGEL FOLD THY HANDS
NOW SHALT THOU SEE TRUE MINISTERS INDEED
LO HOW ALL HUMAN MEANS HE SETS AT NAUGHT
SO THAT NOR OAR HE NEEDS NOR OTHER SAIL
EXCEPT HIS WINGS BETWEEN SUCH DISTANT SHORES
LO HOW STRAIGHT UP TO HEAVEN HE HOLDS THEM REAR'D
WINNOWING THE AIR WITH THOSE ETERNAL PLUMES
THAT NOT LIKE MORTAL HAIRS FALL OFF OR CHANGE
AS MORE AND MORE TOWARD US CAME MORE BRIGHT
APPEAR'D THE BIRD OF GOD NOR COULD THE EYE
ENDURE HIS SPLENDOR NEAR I MINE BENT DOWN
HE DROVE ASHORE IN A SMALL BARK SO SWIFT
AND LIGHT THAT IN ITS COURSE NO WAVE IT DRANK
THE HEAV'NLY STEERSMAN AT THE PROW WAS SEEN
VISIBLY WRITTEN BLESSED IN HIS LOOKS
WITHIN A HUNDRED SPIRITS AND MORE THERE SAT
IN EXITU ISRAEL DE AEGYPTO
ALL WITH ONE VOICE TOGETHER SANG WITH WHAT
IN THE REMAINDER OF THAT HYMN IS WRIT
THEN SOON AS WITH THE SIGN OF HOLY CROSS
HE BLESS'D THEM THEY AT ONCE LEAP'D OUT ON LAND
THE SWIFTLY AS HE CAME RETURN'D
THE CREW
THERE LEFT APPEAR'D ASTOUNDED WITH THE PLACE
GAZING AROUND AS ONE WHO SEES NEW SIGHTS
FROM EVERY SIDE THE SUN DARTED HIS BEAMS
AND WITH HIS ARROWY RADIANCE FROM MID HEAV'N
HAD CHAS'D THE CAPRICORN WHEN THAT STRANGE TRIBE
LIFTING THEIR EYES TOWARDS US IF YE KNOW
DECLARE WHAT PATH WILL LEAD US TO THE MOUNT
THEM VIRGIL ANSWER'D
YE SUPPOSE PERCHANCE
US WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THIS PLACE BUT HERE
WE AS YOURSELVES ARE STRANGERS
NOT LONG ERST
WE CAME BEFORE YOU BUT A LITTLE SPACE
BY OTHER ROAD SO ROUGH AND HARD THAT NOW
THE' ASCENT WILL SEEM TO US AS PLAY THE SPIRITS
WHO FROM MY BREATHING HAD PERCEIV'D I LIV'D
GREW PALE WITH WONDER
AS THE MULTITUDE
FLOCK ROUND A HERALD SENT WITH OLIVE BRANCH
TO HEAR WHAT NEWS HE BRINGS AND IN THEIR HASTE
TREAD ONE ANOTHER DOWN E'EN SO AT SIGHT
OF ME THOSE HAPPY SPIRITS WERE FIX'D EACH ONE
FORGETFUL OF ITS ERRAND TO DEPART
WHERE CLEANS'D FROM SIN IT MIGHT BE MADE ALL FAIR
THEN ONE I SAW DARTING BEFORE THE REST
WITH SUCH FOND ARDOUR TO EMBRACE ME I
TO DO THE LIKE WAS MOV'D
O SHADOWS VAIN
EXCEPT IN OUTWARD SEMBLANCE THRICE MY HANDS
I CLASP'D BEHIND IT THEY AS OFT RETURN'D
EMPTY INTO MY BREAST AGAIN
SURPRISE
I NEEDS MUST THINK WAS PAINTED IN MY LOOKS
FOR THAT THE SHADOW SMIL'D AND BACKWARD DREW
TO FOLLOW IT I HASTEN'D BUT WITH VOICE
OF SWEETNESS IT ENJOIN'D ME TO DESIST
THEN WHO IT WAS I KNEW AND PRAY'D OF IT
TO TALK WITH ME IT WOULD A LITTLE PAUSE
IT ANSWERED THEE AS IN MY MORTAL FRAME
I LOV'D SO LOOS'D FORTH IT I LOVE THEE STILL
AND THEREFORE PAUSE BUT WHY WALKEST THOU HERE
NOT WITHOUT PURPOSE ONCE MORE TO RETURN
THOU FIND'ST ME MY CASELLA WHERE I AM
JOURNEYING THIS WAY I SAID BUT HOW OF THEE
HATH SO MUCH TIME BEEN LOST HE ANSWER'D STRAIGHT
NO OUTRAGE HATH BEEN DONE TO ME IF HE
WHO WHEN AND WHOM HE CHOOSES TAKES ME OFT
THIS PASSAGE HATH DENIED SINCE OF JUST WILL
HIS WILL HE MAKES
THESE THREE MONTHS PAST INDEED
HE WHOSE CHOSE TO ENTER WITH FREE LEAVE
HATH TAKEN WHENCE I WAND'RING BY THE SHORE
WHERE TYBER'S WAVE GROWS SALT OF HIM GAIN'D KIND
ADMITTANCE AT THAT RIVER'S MOUTH TOW'RD WHICH
HIS WINGS ARE POINTED FOR THERE ALWAYS THRONG
ALL SUCH AS NOT TO ARCHERON DESCEND
THEN I IF NEW LAWS HAVE NOT QUITE DESTROY'D
MEMORY AND USE OF THAT SWEET SONG OF LOVE
THAT WHILE ALL MY CARES HAD POWER TO 'SWAGE
PLEASE THEE WITH IT A LITTLE TO CONSOLE
MY SPIRIT THAT INCUMBER'D WITH ITS FRAME
TRAVELLING SO FAR OF PAIN IS OVERCOME
LOVE THAT DISCOURSES IN MY THOUGHTS HE THEN
BEGAN IN SUCH SOFT ACCENTS THAT WITHIN
THE SWEETNESS THRILLS ME YET
MY GENTLE GUIDE
AND ALL WHO CAME WITH HIM SO WELL WERE PLEAS'D
THAT SEEM'D NAUGHT ELSE MIGHT IN THEIR THOUGHTS HAVE ROOM
FAST FIX'D IN MUTE ATTENTION TO HIS NOTES
WE STOOD WHEN LO THAT OLD MAN VENERABLE
EXCLAIMING HOW IS THIS YE TARDY SPIRITS
WHAT NEGLIGENCE DETAINS YOU LOIT'RING HERE
RUN TO THE MOUNTAIN TO CAST OFF THOSE SCALES
THAT FROM YOUR EYES THE SIGHT OF GOD CONCEAL
AS A WILD FLOCK OF PIGEONS TO THEIR FOOD
COLLECTED BLADE OR TARES WITHOUT THEIR PRIDE
ACCUSTOM'D AND IN STILL AND QUIET SORT
IF AUGHT ALARM THEM SUDDENLY DESERT
THEIR MEAL ASSAIL'D BY MORE IMPORTANT CARE
SO I THAT NEW COME TROOP BEHELD THE SONG
DESERTING HASTEN TO THE MOUNTAIN'S SIDE
AS ONE WHO GOES YET WHERE HE TENDS KNOWS NOT
NOR WITH LESS HURRIED STEP DID WE DEPART
CANTO III
THEM SUDDEN FLIGHT HAD SCATTER'D OVER THE PLAIN
TURN'D TOW'RDS THE MOUNTAIN WHITHER REASON'S VOICE
DRIVES US I TO MY FAITHFUL COMPANY
ADHERING LEFT IT NOT
FOR HOW OF HIM
DEPRIV'D MIGHT I HAVE SPED OR WHO BESIDE
WOULD O'ER THE MOUNTAINOUS TRACT HAVE LED MY STEPS
HE WITH THE BITTER PANG OF SELF REMORSE
SEEM'D SMITTEN
O CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND UPRIGHT
HOW DOTH A LITTLE FLING WOUND THEE SORE
SOON AS HIS FEET DESISTED SLACK'NING PACE
FROM HASTE THAT MARS ALL DECENCY OF ACT
MY MIND THAT IN ITSELF BEFORE WAS WRAPT
ITS THOUGHTS EXPANDED AS WITH JOY RESTOR'D
AND FULL AGAINST THE STEEP ASCENT I SET
MY FACE WHERE HIGHEST TO HEAV'N ITS TOP O'ERFLOWS
THE SUN THAT FLAR'D BEHIND WITH RUDDY BEAM
BEFORE MY FORM WAS BROKEN FOR IN ME
HIS RAYS RESISTANCE MET
I TURN'D ASIDE
WITH FEAR OF BEING LEFT WHEN I BEHELD
ONLY BEFORE MYSELF THE GROUND OBSCUR'D
WHEN THUS MY SOLACE TURNING HIM AROUND
BESPAKE ME KINDLY WHY DISTRUSTEST THOU
BELIEV'ST NOT I AM WITH THEE THY SURE GUIDE
IT NOW IS EVENING THERE WHERE BURIED LIES
THE BODY IN WHICH I CAST A SHADE REMOV'D
TO NAPLES FROM BRUNDUSIUM'S WALL
NOR THOU
MARVEL IF BEFORE ME NO SHADOW FALL
MORE THAN THAT IN THE SKY ELEMENT
ONE RAY OBSTRUCTS NOT OTHER
TO ENDURE
TORMENTS OF HEAT AND COLD EXTREME LIKE FRAMES
THAT VIRTUE HATH DISPOS'D WHICH HOW IT WORKS
WILLS NOT TO US SHOULD BE REVEAL'D
INSANE
WHO HOPES OUR REASON MAY THAT SPACE EXPLORE
WHICH HOLDS THREE PERSONS IN ONE SUBSTANCE KNIT
SEEK NOT THE WHEREFORE RACE OF HUMAN KIND
COULD YE HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE NO NEED HAD BEEN
FOR MARY TO BRING FORTH
MOREOVER YE
HAVE SEEN SUCH MEN DESIRING FRUITLESSLY
TO WHOSE DESIRES REPOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN GIV'N
THAT NOW BUT SERVE THEM FOR ETERNAL GRIEF
I SPEAK OF PLATO AND THE STAGYRITE
AND OTHERS MANY MORE AND THEN HE BENT
DOWNWARDS HIS FOREHEAD AND IN TROUBLED MOOD
BROKE OFF HIS SPEECH
MEANWHILE WE HAD ARRIV'D
FAR AS THE MOUNTAIN'S FOOT AND THERE THE ROCK
FOUND OF SO STEEP ASCENT THAT NIMBLEST STEPS
TO CLIMB IT HAD BEEN VAIN
THE MOST REMOTE
MOST WILD UNTRODDEN PATH IN ALL THE TRACT
'TWIXT LERICE AND TURBIA WERE TO THIS
A LADDER EASY' AND OPEN OF ACCESS
WHO KNOWS ON WHICH HAND NOW THE STEEP DECLINES
MY MASTER SAID AND PAUS'D SO THAT HE MAY
ASCEND WHO JOURNEYS WITHOUT AID OF WINE
AND WHILE WITH LOOKS DIRECTED TO THE GROUND
THE MEANING OF THE PATHWAY HE EXPLOR'D
AND I GAZ'D UPWARD ROUND THE STONY HEIGHT
OF SPIRITS THAT TOWARD US MOV'D THEIR STEPS
YET MOVING SEEM'D NOT THEY SO SLOW APPROACH'D
I THUS MY GUIDE ADDRESS'D UPRAISE THINE EYES
LO THAT WAY SOME OF WHOM THOU MAY'ST OBTAIN
COUNSEL IF OF THYSELF THOU FIND'ST IT NOT
STRAIGHTWAY HE LOOK'D AND WITH FREE SPEECH REPLIED
LET US TEND THITHER THEY BUT SOFTLY COME
AND THOU BE FIRM IN HOPE MY SON BELOV'D
NOW WAS THAT PEOPLE DISTANT FAR IN SPACE
A THOUSAND PACES BEHIND OURS AS MUCH
AS AT A THROW THE NERVOUS ARM COULD FLING
WHEN ALL DREW BACKWARD ON THE MESSY CRAGS
OF THE STEEP BANK AND FIRMLY STOOD UNMOV'D
AS ONE WHO WALKS IN DOUBT MIGHT STAND TO LOOK
O SPIRITS PERFECT O ALREADY CHOSEN
VIRGIL TO THEM BEGAN BY THAT BLEST PEACE
WHICH AS I DEEM IS FOR YOU ALL PREPAR'D
INSTRUCT US WHERE THE MOUNTAIN LOW DECLINES
SO THAT ATTEMPT TO MOUNT IT BE NOT VAIN
FOR WHO KNOWS MOST HIM LOSS OF TIME MOST GRIEVES
AS SHEEP THAT STEP FROM FORTH THEIR FOLD BY ONE
OR PAIRS OR THREE AT ONCE MEANWHILE THE REST
STAND FEARFULLY BENDING THE EYE AND NOSE
TO GROUND AND WHAT THE FOREMOST DOES THAT DO
THE OTHERS GATH'RING ROUND HER IF SHE STOPS
SIMPLE AND QUIET NOR THE CAUSE DISCERN
SO SAW I MOVING TO ADVANCE THE FIRST
WHO OF THAT FORTUNATE CREW WERE AT THE HEAD
OF MODEST MIEN AND GRACEFUL IN THEIR GAIT
WHEN THEY BEFORE ME HAD BEHELD THE LIGHT
FROM MY RIGHT SIDE FALL BROKEN ON THE GROUND
SO THAT THE SHADOW REACH'D THE CAVE THEY STOPP'D
AND SOMEWHAT BACK RETIR'D THE SAME DID ALL
WHO FOLLOW'D THOUGH UNWEETING OF THE CAUSE
UNASK'D OF YOU YET FREELY I CONFESS
THIS IS A HUMAN BODY WHICH YE SEE
THAT THE SUN'S LIGHT IS BROKEN ON THE GROUND
MARVEL NOT BUT BELIEVE THAT NOT WITHOUT
VIRTUE DERIV'D FROM HEAVEN WE TO CLIMB
OVER THIS WALL ASPIRE SO THEM BESPAKE
MY MASTER AND THAT VIRTUOUS TRIBE REJOIN'D
TURN AND BEFORE YOU THERE THE ENTRANCE LIES
MAKING A SIGNAL TO US WITH BENT HANDS
THEN OF THEM ONE BEGAN
WHOE'ER THOU ART
WHO JOURNEY'ST THUS THIS WAY THY VISAGE TURN
THINK IF ME ELSEWHERE THOU HAST EVER SEEN
I TOW'RDS HIM TURN'D AND WITH FIX'D EYE BEHELD
COMELY AND FAIR AND GENTLE OF ASPECT
HE SEEM'D BUT ON ONE BROW A GASH WAS MARK'D
WHEN HUMBLY I DISCLAIM'D TO HAVE BEHELD
HIM EVER NOW BEHOLD HE SAID AND SHOW'D
HIGH ON HIS BREAST A WOUND THEN SMILING SPAKE
I AM MANFREDI GRANDSON TO THE QUEEN
COSTANZA WHENCE I PRAY THEE WHEN RETURN'D
TO MY FAIR DAUGHTER GO THE PARENT GLAD
OF ARAGONIA AND SICILIA'S PRIDE
AND OF THE TRUTH INFORM HER IF OF ME
AUGHT ELSE BE TOLD
WHEN BY TWO MORTAL BLOWS
MY FRAME WAS SHATTER'D I BETOOK MYSELF
WEEPING TO HIM WHO OF FREE WILL FORGIVES
MY SINS WERE HORRIBLE BUT SO WIDE ARMS
HATH GOODNESS INFINITE THAT IT RECEIVES
ALL WHO TURN TO IT
HAD THIS TEXT DIVINE
BEEN OF COSENZA'S SHEPHERD BETTER SCANN'D
WHO THEN BY CLEMENT ON MY HUNT WAS SET
YET AT THE BRIDGE'S HEAD MY BONES HAD LAIN
NEAR BENEVENTO BY THE HEAVY MOLE
PROTECTED BUT THE RAIN NOW DRENCHES THEM
AND THE WIND DRIVES OUT OF THE KINGDOM'S BOUNDS
FAR AS THE STREAM OF VERDE WHERE WITH LIGHTS
EXTINGUISH'D HE REMOV'D THEM FROM THEIR BED
YET BY THEIR CURSE WE ARE NOT SO DESTROY'D
BUT THAT THE ETERNAL LOVE MAY TURN WHILE HOPE
RETAINS HER VERDANT BLOSSOMS
TRUE IT IS
THAT SUCH ONE AS IN CONTUMACY DIES
AGAINST THE HOLY CHURCH THOUGH HE REPENT
MUST WANDER THIRTY FOLD FOR ALL THE TIME
IN HIS PRESUMPTION PAST IF SUCH DECREE
BE NOT BY PRAYERS OF GOOD MEN SHORTER MADE
LOOK THEREFORE IF THOU CANST ADVANCE MY BLISS
REVEALING TO MY GOOD COSTANZA HOW
THOU HAST BEHELD ME AND BESIDE THE TERMS
LAID ON ME OF THAT INTERDICT FOR HERE
BY MEANS OF THOSE BELOW MUCH PROFIT COMES
CANTO IV
WHEN BY SENSATIONS OF DELIGHT OR PAIN
THAT ANY OF OUR FACULTIES HATH SEIZ'D
ENTIRE THE SOUL COLLECTS HERSELF IT SEEMS
SHE IS INTENT UPON THAT POWER ALONE
AND THUS THE ERROR IS DISPROV'D WHICH HOLDS
THE SOUL NOT SINGLY LIGHTED IN THE BREAST
AND THEREFORE WHEN AS AUGHT IS HEARD OR SEEN
THAT FIRMLY KEEPS THE SOUL TOWARD IT TURN'D
TIME PASSES AND A MAN PERCEIVES IT NOT
FOR THAT WHEREBY HE HEARKEN IS ONE POWER
ANOTHER THAT WHICH THE WHOLE SPIRIT HASH
THIS IS AS IT WERE BOUND WHILE THAT IS FREE
THIS FOUND I TRUE BY PROOF HEARING THAT SPIRIT
AND WOND'RING FOR FULL FIFTY STEPS ALOFT
THE SUN HAD MEASUR'D UNOBSERV'D OF ME
WHEN WE ARRIV'D WHERE ALL WITH ONE ACCORD
THE SPIRITS SHOUTED HERE IS WHAT YE ASK
A LARGER APERTURE OFTTIMES IS STOPP'D
WITH FORKED STAKE OF THORN BY VILLAGER
WHEN THE RIPE GRAPE IMBROWNS THAN WAS THE PATH
BY WHICH MY GUIDE AND I BEHIND HIM CLOSE
ASCENDED SOLITARY WHEN THAT TROOP
DEPARTING LEFT US
ON SANLEO'S ROAD
WHO JOURNEYS OR TO NOLI LOW DESCENDS
OR MOUNTS BISMANTUA'S HEIGHT MUST USE HIS FEET
BUT HERE A MAN HAD NEED TO FLY I MEAN
WITH THE SWIFT WING AND PLUMES OF HIGH DESIRE
CONDUCTED BY HIS AID WHO GAVE ME HOPE
AND WITH LIGHT FURNISH'D TO DIRECT MY WAY
WE THROUGH THE BROKEN ROCK ASCENDED CLOSE
PENT ON EACH SIDE WHILE UNDERNEATH THE GROUND
ASK'D HELP OF HANDS AND FEET
WHEN WE ARRIV'D
NEAR ON THE HIGHEST RIDGE OF THE STEEP BANK
WHERE THE PLAIN LEVEL OPEN'D I EXCLAIM'D
O MASTER SAY WHICH WAY CAN WE PROCEED
HE ANSWER'D LET NO STEP OF THINE RECEDE
BEHIND ME GAIN THE MOUNTAIN TILL TO US
SOME PRACTIS'D GUIDE APPEAR THAT EMINENCE
WAS LOFTY THAT NO EYE MIGHT REACH ITS POINT
AND THE SIDE PROUDLY RISING MORE THAN LINE
FROM THE MID QUADRANT TO THE CENTRE DRAWN
I WEARIED THUS BEGAN PARENT BELOV'D
TURN AND BEHOLD HOW I REMAIN ALONE
IF THOU STAY NOT MY SON HE STRAIGHT REPLY'D
THUS FAR PUT FORTH THY STRENGTH AND TO A TRACK
POINTED THAT ON THIS SIDE PROJECTING ROUND
CIRCLES THE HILL
HIS WORDS SO SPURR'D ME ON
THAT I BEHIND HIM CLAMB'RING FORC'D MYSELF
TILL MY FEET PRESS'D THE CIRCUIT PLAIN BENEATH
THERE BOTH TOGETHER SEATED TURN'D WE ROUND
TO EASTWARD WHENCE WAS OUR ASCENT AND OFT
MANY BESIDE HAVE WITH DELIGHT LOOK'D BACK
FIRST ON THE NETHER SHORES I TURN'D MY EYES
THEN RAIS'D THEM TO THE SUN AND WOND'RING MARK'D
THAT FROM THE LEFT IT SMOTE US
SOON PERCEIV'D
THAT POET SAGE NOW AT THE CAR OF LIGHT
AMAZ'D I STOOD WHERE 'TWIXT US AND THE NORTH
ITS COURSE IT ENTER'D
WHENCE HE THUS TO ME
WERE LEDA'S OFFSPRING NOW IN COMPANY
OF THAT BROAD MIRROR THAT HIGH UP AND LOW
IMPARTS HIS LIGHT BENEATH THOU MIGHT'ST BEHOLD
THE RUDDY ZODIAC NEARER TO THE BEARS
WHEEL IF ITS ANCIENT COURSE IT NOT FORSOOK
HOW THAT MAY BE IF THOU WOULD'ST THINK WITHIN
POND'RING IMAGINE SION WITH THIS MOUNT
PLAC'D ON THE EARTH SO THAT TO BOTH BE ONE
HORIZON AND TWO HEMISPHERES APART
WHERE LIES THE PATH THAT PHAETON ILL KNEW
TO GUIDE HIS ERRING CHARIOT THOU WILT SEE
HOW OF NECESSITY BY THIS ON ONE
HE PASSES WHILE BY THAT ON THE' OTHER SIDE
IF WITH CLEAR VIEW SHINE INTELLECT ATTEND
OF TRUTH KIND TEACHER I EXCLAIM'D SO CLEAR
AUGHT SAW I NEVER AS I NOW DISCERN
WHERE SEEM'D MY KEN TO FAIL THAT THE MID ORB
OF THE SUPERNAL MOTION WHICH IN TERMS
OF ART IS CALLED THE EQUATOR AND REMAINS
EVER BETWEEN THE SUN AND WINTER FOR THE CAUSE
THOU HAST ASSIGN'D FROM HENCE TOWARD THE NORTH
DEPARTS WHEN THOSE WHO IN THE HEBREW LAND
INHABIT SEE IT TOW'RDS THE WARMER PART
BUT IF IT PLEASE THEE I WOULD GLADLY KNOW
HOW FAR WE HAVE TO JOURNEY FOR THE HILL
MOUNTS HIGHER THAN THIS SIGHT OF MINE CAN MOUNT
HE THUS TO ME SUCH IS THIS STEEP ASCENT
THAT IT IS EVER DIFFICULT AT FIRST
BUT MORE A MAN PROCEEDS LESS EVIL GROWS
WHEN PLEASANT IT SHALL SEEM TO THEE SO MUCH
THAT UPWARD GOING SHALL BE EASY TO THEE
AS IN A VESSEL TO GO DOWN THE TIDE
THEN OF THIS PATH THOU WILT HAVE REACH'D THE END
THERE HOPE TO REST THEE FROM THY TOIL
NO MORE
I ANSWER AND THUS FAR FOR CERTAIN KNOW
AS HE HIS WORDS HAD SPOKEN NEAR TO US
A VOICE THERE SOUNDED YET YE FIRST PERCHANCE
MAY TO REPOSE YOU BY CONSTRAINT BE LED
AT SOUND THEREOF EACH TURN'D AND ON THE LEFT
A HUGE STONE WE BEHELD OF WHICH NOR I
NOR HE BEFORE WAS WARE
THITHER WE DREW
FIND THERE WERE SOME WHO IN THE SHADY PLACE
BEHIND THE ROCK WERE STANDING AS A MAN
THRU' IDLENESS MIGHT STAND
AMONG THEM ONE
WHO SEEM'D TO ME MUCH WEARIED SAT HIM DOWN
AND WITH HIS ARMS DID FOLD HIS KNEES ABOUT
HOLDING HIS FACE BETWEEN THEM DOWNWARD BENT
SWEET SIR I CRY'D BEHOLD THAT MAN WHO SHOWS
HIMSELF MORE IDLE THAN IF LAZINESS
WERE SISTER TO HIM STRAIGHT HE TURN'D TO US
AND O'ER THE THIGH LIFTING HIS FACE OBSERV'D
THEN IN THESE ACCENTS SPAKE UP THEN PROCEED
THOU VALIANT ONE STRAIGHT WHO IT WAS I KNEW
NOR COULD THE PAIN I FELT FOR WANT OF BREATH
STILL SOMEWHAT URG'D ME HINDER MY APPROACH
AND WHEN I CAME TO HIM HE SCARCE HIS HEAD
UPLIFTED SAYING WELL HAST THOU DISCERN'D
HOW FROM THE LEFT THE SUN HIS CHARIOT LEADS
HIS LAZY ACTS AND BROKEN WORDS MY LIPS
TO LAUGHTER SOMEWHAT MOV'D WHEN I BEGAN
BELACQUA NOW FOR THEE I GRIEVE NO MORE
BUT TELL WHY THOU ART SEATED UPRIGHT THERE
WAITEST THOU ESCORT TO CONDUCT THEE HENCE
OR BLAME I ONLY SHINE ACCUSTOM'D WAYS
THEN HE MY BROTHER OF WHAT USE TO MOUNT
WHEN TO MY SUFFERING WOULD NOT LET ME PASS
THE BIRD OF GOD WHO AT THE PORTAL SITS
BEHOOVES SO LONG THAT HEAV'N FIRST BEAR ME ROUND
WITHOUT ITS LIMITS AS IN LIFE IT BORE
BECAUSE I TO THE END REPENTANT SIGHS
DELAY'D IF PRAYER DO NOT AID ME FIRST
THAT RISETH UP FROM HEART WHICH LIVES IN GRACE
WHAT OTHER KIND AVAILS NOT HEARD IN HEAVEN
BEFORE ME NOW THE POET UP THE MOUNT
ASCENDING CRIED HASTE THEE FOR SEE THE SUN
HAS TOUCH'D THE POINT MERIDIAN AND THE NIGHT
NOW COVERS WITH HER FOOT MAROCCO'S SHORE
CANTO V
NOW HAD I LEFT THOSE SPIRITS AND PURSUED
THE STEPS OF MY CONDUCTOR WHEN BEHELD
POINTING THE FINGER AT ME ONE EXCLAIM'D
SEE HOW IT SEEMS AS IF THE LIGHT NOT SHONE
FROM THE LEFT HAND OF HIM BENEATH AND HE
AS LIVING SEEMS TO BE LED ON MINE EYES
I AT THAT SOUND REVERTING SAW THEM GAZE
THROUGH WONDER FIRST AT ME AND THEN AT ME
AND THE LIGHT BROKEN UNDERNEATH BY TURNS
WHY ARE THY THOUGHTS THUS RIVETED MY GUIDE
EXCLAIM'D THAT THOU HAST SLACK'D THY PACE OR HOW
IMPORTS IT THEE WHAT THING IS WHISPER'D HERE
COME AFTER ME AND TO THEIR BABBLINGS LEAVE
THE CROWD
BE AS A TOWER THAT FIRMLY SET
SHAKES NOT ITS TOP FOR ANY BLAST THAT BLOWS
HE IN WHOSE BOSOM THOUGHT ON THOUGHT SHOOTS OUT
STILL OF HIS AIM IS WIDE IN THAT THE ONE
SICKLIES AND WASTES TO NOUGHT THE OTHER'S STRENGTH
WHAT OTHER COULD I ANSWER SAVE I COME
I SAID IT SOMEWHAT WITH THAT COLOUR TING'D
WHICH OFTTIMES PARDON MERITETH FOR MAN
MEANWHILE TRAVERSE ALONG THE HILL THERE CAME
A LITTLE WAY BEFORE US SOME WHO SANG
THE MISERERE IN RESPONSIVE STRAINS
WHEN THEY PERCEIV'D THAT THROUGH MY BODY I
GAVE WAY NOT FOR THE RAYS TO PASS THEIR SONG
STRAIGHT TO A LONG AND HOARSE EXCLAIM THEY CHANG'D
AND TWO OF THEM IN GUISE OF MESSENGERS
RAN ON TO MEET US AND INQUIRING ASK'D
OF YOUR CONDITION WE WOULD GLADLY LEARN
TO THEM MY GUIDE
YE MAY RETURN AND BEAR
TIDINGS TO THEM WHO SENT YOU THAT HIS FRAME
IS REAL FLESH
IF AS I DEEM TO VIEW
HIS SHADE THEY PAUS'D ENOUGH IS ANSWER'D THEM
HIM LET THEM HONOUR THEY MAY PRIZE HIM WELL
NE'ER SAW I FIERY VAPOURS WITH SUCH SPEED
CUT THROUGH THE SERENE AIR AT FALL OF NIGHT
NOR AUGUST'S CLOUDS ATHWART THE SETTING SUN
THAT UPWARD THESE DID NOT IN SHORTER SPACE
RETURN AND THERE ARRIVING WITH THE REST
WHEEL BACK ON US AS WITH LOOSE REIN A TROOP
MANY EXCLAIM'D THE BARD ARE THESE WHO THRONG
AROUND US TO PETITION THEE THEY COME
GO THEREFORE ON AND LISTEN AS THOU GO'ST
O SPIRIT WHO GO'ST ON TO BLESSEDNESS
WITH THE SAME LIMBS THAT CLAD THEE AT THY BIRTH
SHOUTING THEY CAME A LITTLE REST THY STEP

HAST E'ER BEHELD THAT TIDINGS OF HIM THERE
THOU MAYST REPORT
AH WHEREFORE GO'ST THOU ON
AH WHEREFORE TARRIEST THOU NOT WE ALL
BY VIOLENCE DIED AND TO OUR LATEST HOUR
WERE SINNERS BUT THEN WARN'D BY LIGHT FROM HEAV'N
SO THAT REPENTING AND FORGIVING WE
DID ISSUE OUT OF LIFE AT PEACE WITH GOD
WHO WITH DESIRE TO SEE HIM FILLS OUR HEART
THEN I THE VISAGES OF ALL I SCAN
YET NONE OF YE REMEMBER
BUT IF AUGHT
THAT I CAN DO MAY PLEASE YOU GENTLE SPIRITS
SPEAK AND I WILL PERFORM IT BY THAT PEACE
WHICH ON THE STEPS OF GUIDE SO EXCELLENT
FOLLOWING FROM WORLD TO WORLD INTENT I SEEK
IN ANSWER HE BEGAN NONE HERE DISTRUSTS
THY KINDNESS THOUGH NOT PROMIS'D WITH AN OATH
SO AS THE WILL FAIL NOT FOR WANT OF POWER
WHENCE I WHO SOLE BEFORE THE OTHERS SPEAK
ENTREAT THEE IF THOU EVER SEE THAT LAND
WHICH LIES BETWEEN ROMAGNA AND THE REALM
OF CHARLES THAT OF THY COURTESY THOU PRAY
THOSE WHO INHABIT FANO THAT FOR ME
THEIR ADORATIONS DULY BE PUT UP
BY WHICH I MAY PURGE OFF MY GRIEVOUS SINS
FROM THENCE I CAME
BUT THE DEEP PASSAGES
WHENCE ISSUED OUT THE BLOOD WHEREIN I DWELT
UPON MY BOSOM IN ANTENOR'S LAND
WERE MADE WHERE TO BE MORE SECURE I THOUGHT
THE AUTHOR OF THE DEED WAS ESTE'S PRINCE
WHO MORE THAN RIGHT COULD WARRANT WITH HIS WRATH
PURSUED ME
HAD I TOWARDS MIRA FLED
WHEN OVERTA'EN AT ORIACO STILL
MIGHT I HAVE BREATH'D
BUT TO THE MARSH I SPED
AND IN THE MIRE AND RUSHES TANGLED THERE
FELL AND BEHELD MY LIFE BLOOD FLOAT THE PLAIN
THEN SAID ANOTHER AH SO MAY THE WISH
THAT TAKES THEE O'ER THE MOUNTAIN BE FULFILL'D
AS THOU SHALT GRACIOUSLY GIVE AID TO MINE
OF MONTEFELTRO I BUONCONTE I

SORROWING WITH THESE I THEREFORE GO I THUS
FROM CAMPALDINO'S FIELD WHAT FORCE OR CHANCE
DREW THEE THAT NE'ER THY SEPULTURE WAS KNOWN
OH ANSWER'D HE AT CASENTINO'S FOOT
A STREAM THERE COURSETH NAM'D ARCHIANO SPRUNG
IN APENNINE ABOVE THE HERMIT'S SEAT
E'EN WHERE ITS NAME IS CANCEL'D THERE CAME I
PIERC'D IN THE HEART FLEEING AWAY ON FOOT
AND BLOODYING THE PLAIN
HERE SIGHT AND SPEECH
FAIL'D ME AND FINISHING WITH MARY'S NAME
I FELL AND TENANTLESS MY FLESH REMAIN'D
I WILL REPORT THE TRUTH WHICH THOU AGAIN
TELL TO THE LIVING
ME GOD'S ANGEL TOOK
WHILST HE OF HELL EXCLAIM'D O THOU FROM HEAV'N
SAY WHEREFORE HAST THOU ROBB'D ME THOU OF HIM
TH' ETERNAL PORTION BEAR'ST WITH THEE AWAY
FOR ONE POOR TEAR THAT HE DEPRIVES ME OF
BUT OF THE OTHER OTHER RULE I MAKE
THOU KNOWEST HOW IN THE ATMOSPHERE COLLECTS
THAT VAPOUR DANK RETURNING INTO WATER
SOON AS IT MOUNTS WHERE COLD CONDENSES IT
THAT EVIL WILL WHICH IN HIS INTELLECT
STILL FOLLOWS EVIL CAME AND RAIS'D THE WIND
AND SMOKY MIST BY VIRTUE OF THE POWER
GIVEN BY HIS NATURE
THENCE THE VALLEY SOON
AS DAY WAS SPENT HE COVER'D O'ER WITH CLOUD
FROM PRATOMAGNO TO THE MOUNTAIN RANGE
AND STRETCH'D THE SKY ABOVE SO THAT THE AIR
IMPREGNATE CHANG'D TO WATER
FELL THE RAIN
AND TO THE FOSSES CAME ALL THAT THE LAND
CONTAIN'D NOT AND AS MIGHTIEST STREAMS ARE WONT
TO THE GREAT RIVER WITH SUCH HEADLONG SWEEP
RUSH'D THAT NOUGHT STAY'D ITS COURSE
MY STIFFEN'D FRAME
LAID AT HIS MOUTH THE FELL ARCHIANO FOUND
AND DASH'D IT INTO ARNO FROM MY BREAST
LOOS'NING THE CROSS THAT OF MYSELF I MADE
WHEN OVERCOME WITH PAIN
HE HURL'D ME ON
ALONG THE BANKS AND BOTTOM OF HIS COURSE
THEN IN HIS MUDDY SPOILS ENCIRCLING WRAPT
AH WHEN THOU TO THE WORLD SHALT BE RETURN'D
AND RESTED AFTER THY LONG ROAD SO SPAKE
NEXT THE THIRD SPIRIT THEN REMEMBER ME
I ONCE WAS PIA
SIENNA GAVE ME LIFE
MAREMMA TOOK IT FROM ME
THAT HE KNOWS
WHO ME WITH JEWELL'D RING HAD FIRST ESPOUS'D
CANTO VI
WHEN FROM THEIR GAME OF DICE MEN SEPARATE
HE WHO HATH LOST REMAINS IN SADNESS FIX'D
REVOLVING IN HIS MIND WHAT LUCKLESS THROWS
HE CAST BUT MEANWHILE ALL THE COMPANY
GO WITH THE OTHER ONE BEFORE HIM RUNS
AND ONE BEHIND HIS MANTLE TWITCHES ONE
FAST BY HIS SIDE BIDS HIM REMEMBER HIM
HE STOPS NOT AND EACH ONE TO WHOM HIS HAND
IS STRETCH'D WELL KNOWS HE BIDS HIM STAND ASIDE
AND THUS HE FROM THE PRESS DEFENDS HIMSELF
E'EN SUCH WAS I IN THAT CLOSE CROWDING THRONG
AND TURNING SO MY FACE AROUND TO ALL
AND PROMISING I 'SCAP'D FROM IT WITH PAINS

OR IS THY SAYING NOT TO ME REVEAL'D

AND THESE DECEIV'D NOT IN THEIR HOPE IF WELL
THY MIND CONSIDER THAT THE SACRED HEIGHT
OF JUDGMENT DOTH NOT STOOP BECAUSE LOVE'S FLAME
IN A SHORT MOMENT ALL FULFILS WHICH HE
WHO SOJOURNS HERE IN RIGHT SHOULD SATISFY
BESIDES WHEN I THIS POINT CONCLUDED THUS
BY PRAYING NO DEFECT COULD BE SUPPLIED
BECAUSE THE PRAY'R HAD NONE ACCESS TO GOD
YET IN THIS DEEP SUSPICION REST THOU NOT
CONTENTED UNLESS SHE ASSURE THEE SO

SHOWS THEE TO ME IF I TO HEAR THAT VOICE
AM WORTHY SAY IF FROM BELOW THOU COM'ST
AND FROM WHAT CLOISTER'S PALE THROUGH EVERY ORB
OF THAT SAD REGION HE REPLY'D THUS FAR
AM I ARRIV'D BY HEAV'NLY INFLUENCE LED
AND WITH SUCH AID I COME
THERE IS A PLACE
THERE UNDERNEATH NOT MADE BY TORMENTS SAD
BUT BY DUN SHADES ALONE WHERE MOURNING'S VOICE
SOUNDS NOT OF ANGUISH SHARP BUT BREATHES IN SIGHS
THERE I WITH LITTLE INNOCENTS ABIDE
WHO BY DEATH'S FANGS WERE BITTEN ERE EXEMPT
FROM HUMAN TAINT
THERE I WITH THOSE ABIDE
WHO THE THREE HOLY VIRTUES PUT NOT ON
BUT UNDERSTOOD THE REST AND WITHOUT BLAME
FOLLOW'D THEM ALL
BUT IF THOU KNOW'ST AND CANST
DIRECT US HOW WE SOONEST MAY ARRIVE
WHERE PURGATORY ITS TRUE BEGINNING TAKES
HE ANSWER'D THUS WE HAVE NO CERTAIN PLACE
ASSIGN'D US UPWARDS I MAY GO OR ROUND
FAR AS I CAN I JOIN THEE FOR THY GUIDE
BUT THOU BEHOLDEST NOW HOW DAY DECLINES
AND UPWARDS TO PROCEED BY NIGHT OUR POWER
EXCELS THEREFORE IT MAY BE WELL TO CHOOSE
A PLACE OF PLEASANT SOJOURN
TO THE RIGHT
SOME SPIRITS SIT APART RETIR'D
IF THOU
CONSENTEST I TO THESE WILL LEAD THY STEPS
AND THOU WILT KNOW THEM NOT WITHOUT DELIGHT
HOW CHANCES THIS WAS ANSWER'D WHO SO WISH'D
TO ASCEND BY NIGHT WOULD HE BE THENCE DEBARR'D
BY OTHER OR THROUGH HIS OWN WEAKNESS FAIL
THE GOOD SORDELLO THEN ALONG THE GROUND
TRAILING HIS FINGER SPOKE ONLY THIS LINE
THOU SHALT NOT OVERPASS SOON AS THE SUN
HATH DISAPPEAR'D NOT THAT AUGHT ELSE IMPEDES
THY GOING UPWARDS SAVE THE SHADES OF NIGHT
THESE WITH THE WONT OF POWER PERPLEX THE WILL
WITH THEM THOU HAPLY MIGHTST RETURN BENEATH
OR TO AND FRO AROUND THE MOUNTAIN'S SIDE
WANDER WHILE DAY IS IN THE HORIZON SHUT
MY MASTER STRAIGHT AS WOND'RING AT HIS SPEECH
EXCLAIM'D THEN LEAD US QUICKLY WHERE THOU SAYST
THAT WHILE WE STAY WE MAY ENJOY DELIGHT
A LITTLE SPACE WE WERE REMOV'D FROM THENCE
WHEN I PERCEIV'D THE MOUNTAIN HOLLOW'D OUT
EV'N AS LARGE VALLEYS HOLLOW'D OUT ON EARTH
THAT WAY THE' ESCORTING SPIRIT CRIED WE GO
WHERE IN A BOSOM THE HIGH BANK RECEDES
AND THOU AWAIT RENEWAL OF THE DAY
BETWIXT THE STEEP AND PLAIN A CROOKED PATH
LED US TRAVERSE INTO THE RIDGE'S SIDE
WHERE MORE THAN HALF THE SLOPING EDGE EXPIRES
REFULGENT GOLD AND SILVER THRICE REFIN'D
AND SCARLET GRAIN AND CERUSE INDIAN WOOD
OF LUCID DYE SERENE FRESH EMERALDS
BUT NEWLY BROKEN BY THE HERBS AND FLOWERS
PLAC'D IN THAT FAIR RECESS IN COLOR ALL
HAD BEEN SURPASS'D AS GREAT SURPASSES LESS
NOR NATURE ONLY THERE LAVISH'D HER HUES
BUT OF THE SWEETNESS OF A THOUSAND SMELLS
A RARE AND UNDISTINGUISH'D FRAGRANCE MADE
SALVE REGINA ON THE GRASS AND FLOWERS
HERE CHANTING I BEHELD THOSE SPIRITS SIT
WHO NOT BEYOND THE VALLEY COULD BE SEEN
BEFORE THE WEST'RING SUN SINK TO HIS BED
BEGAN THE MANTUAN WHO OUR STEPS HAD TURN'D
'MID THOSE DESIRES NOT THAT I LEAD YE ON
FOR FROM THIS EMINENCE YE SHALL DISCERN
BETTER THE ACTS AND VISAGES OF ALL
THAN IN THE NETHER VALE AMONG THEM MIX'D
HE WHO SITS HIGH ABOVE THE REST AND SEEMS
TO HAVE NEGLECTED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DONE
AND TO THE OTHERS' SONG MOVES NOT HIS LIP
THE EMPEROR RODOLPH CALL WHO MIGHT HAVE HEAL'D
THE WOUNDS WHEREOF FAIR ITALY HATH DIED
SO THAT BY OTHERS SHE REVIVES BUT SLOWLY
HE WHO WITH KINDLY VISAGE COMFORTS HIM
SWAY'D IN THAT COUNTRY WHERE THE WATER SPRINGS
THAT MOLDAW'S RIVER TO THE ELBE AND ELBE
ROLLS TO THE OCEAN OTTOCAR HIS NAME
WHO IN HIS SWADDLING CLOTHES WAS OF MORE WORTH
THAN WINCESLAUS HIS SON A BEARDED MAN
PAMPER'D WITH RANK LUXURIOUSNESS AND EASE
AND THAT ONE WITH THE NOSE DEPRESS WHO CLOSE
IN COUNSEL SEEMS WITH HIM OF GENTLE LOOK
FLYING EXPIR'D WITH'RING THE LILY'S FLOWER
LOOK THERE HOW HE DOTH KNOCK AGAINST HIS BREAST
THE OTHER YE BEHOLD WHO FOR HIS CHEEK
MAKES OF ONE HAND A COUCH WITH FREQUENT SIGHS
THEY ARE THE FATHER AND THE FATHER IN LAW
OF GALLIA'S BANE HIS VICIOUS LIFE THEY KNOW
AND FOUL THENCE COMES THE GRIEF THAT RENDS THEM THUS
HE SO ROBUST OF LIMB WHO MEASURE KEEPS
IN SONG WITH HIM OF FEATURE PROMINENT
WITH EV'RY VIRTUE BORE HIS GIRDLE BRAC'D
AND IF THAT STRIPLING WHO BEHINDS HIM SITS
KING AFTER HIM HAD LIV'D HIS VIRTUE THEN
FROM VESSEL TO LIKE VESSEL HAD BEEN POUR'D
WHICH MAY NOT OF THE OTHER HEIRS BE SAID
BY JAMES AND FREDERICK HIS REALMS ARE HELD
NEITHER THE BETTER HERITAGE OBTAINS
RARELY INTO THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE
DOTH HUMAN WORTH MOUNT UP AND SO ORDAINS
HE WHO BESTOWS IT THAT AS HIS FREE GIFT
IT MAY BE CALL'D
TO CHARLES MY WORDS APPLY
NO LESS THAN TO HIS BROTHER IN THE SONG
WHICH POUILLE AND PROVENCE NOW WITH GRIEF CONFESS
SO MUCH THAT PLANT DEGENERATES FROM ITS SEED
AS MORE THAN BEATRICE AND MARGARET
COSTANZA STILL BOASTS OF HER VALOROUS SPOUSE
BEHOLD THE KING OF SIMPLE LIFE AND PLAIN
HARRY OF ENGLAND SITTING THERE ALONE
HE THROUGH HIS BRANCHES BETTER ISSUE SPREADS
THAT ONE WHO ON THE GROUND BENEATH THE REST
SITS LOWEST YET HIS GAZE DIRECTS ALOFT
US WILLIAM THAT BRAVE MARQUIS FOR WHOSE CAUSE
THE DEED OF ALEXANDRIA AND HIS WAR
MAKES CONFERRAT AND CANAVESE WEEP
CANTO VIII
NOW WAS THE HOUR THAT WAKENS FOND DESIRE
IN MEN AT SEA AND MELTS THEIR THOUGHTFUL HEART
WHO IN THE MORN HAVE BID SWEET FRIENDS FAREWELL
AND PILGRIM NEWLY ON HIS ROAD WITH LOVE
THRILLS IF HE HEAR THE VESPER BELL FROM FAR
THAT SEEMS TO MOURN FOR THE EXPIRING DAY
WHEN I NO LONGER TAKING HEED TO HEAR
BEGAN WITH WONDER FROM THOSE SPIRITS TO MARK
ONE RISEN FROM ITS SEAT WHICH WITH ITS HAND
AUDIENCE IMPLOR'D
BOTH PALMS IT JOIN'D AND RAIS'D
FIXING ITS STEADFAST GAZE TOWARDS THE EAST
AS TELLING GOD I CARE FOR NAUGHT BESIDE
TE LUCIS ANTE SO DEVOUTLY THEN
CAME FROM ITS LIP AND IN SO SOFT A STRAIN
THAT ALL MY SENSE IN RAVISHMENT WAS LOST
AND THE REST AFTER SOFTLY AND DEVOUT
FOLLOW'D THROUGH ALL THE HYMN WITH UPWARD GAZE
DIRECTED TO THE BRIGHT SUPERNAL WHEELS
HERE READER FOR THE TRUTH MAKES THINE EYES KEEN
FOR OF SO SUBTLE TEXTURE IS THIS VEIL
THAT THOU WITH EASE MAYST PASS IT THROUGH UNMARK'D
I SAW THAT GENTLE BAND SILENTLY NEXT
LOOK UP AS IF IN EXPECTATION HELD
PALE AND IN LOWLY GUISE AND FROM ON HIGH
I SAW FORTH ISSUING DESCEND BENEATH
TWO ANGELS WITH TWO FLAME ILLUMIN'D SWORDS
BROKEN AND MUTILATED AT THEIR POINTS
GREEN AS THE TENDER LEAVES BUT NEWLY BORN
THEIR VESTURE WAS THE WHICH BY WINGS AS GREEN
BEATEN THEY DREW BEHIND THEM FANN'D IN AIR
A LITTLE OVER US ONE TOOK HIS STAND
THE OTHER LIGHTED ON THE' OPPOSING HILL
SO THAT THE TROOP WERE IN THE MIDST CONTAIN'D
WELL I DESCRIED THE WHITENESS ON THEIR HEADS
BUT IN THEIR VISAGES THE DAZZLED EYE
WAS LOST AS FACULTY THAT BY TOO MUCH
IS OVERPOWER'D
FROM MARY'S BOSOM BOTH
ARE COME EXCLAIM'D SORDELLO AS A GUARD
OVER THE VALE GANST HIM WHO HITHER TENDS
THE SERPENT WHENCE NOT KNOWING BY WHICH PATH
HE CAME I TURN'D ME ROUND AND CLOSELY PRESS'D
ALL FROZEN TO MY LEADER'S TRUSTED SIDE
SORDELLO PAUS'D NOT TO THE VALLEY NOW
FOR IT IS TIME LET US DESCEND AND HOLD
CONVERSE WITH THOSE GREAT SHADOWS HAPLY MUCH
THEIR SIGHT MAY PLEASE YE ONLY THREE STEPS DOWN
METHINKS I MEASUR'D ERE I WAS BENEATH
AND NOTED ONE WHO LOOK'D AS WITH DESIRE
TO KNOW ME
TIME WAS NOW THAT AIR ARROW DIM
YET NOT SO DIM THAT 'TWIXT HIS EYES AND MINE
IT CLEAR'D NOT UP WHAT WAS CONCEAL'D BEFORE
MUTUALLY TOW'RDS EACH OTHER WE ADVANC'D
NINO THOU COURTEOUS JUDGE WHAT JOY I FELT
WHEN I PERCEIV'D THOU WERT NOT WITH THE BAD
NO SALUTATION KIND ON EITHER PART
WAS LEFT UNSAID
HE THEN INQUIR'D HOW LONG
SINCE THOU ARRIVED'ST AT THE MOUNTAIN'S FOOT
OVER THE DISTANT WAVES O ANSWER'D I
THROUGH THE SAD SEATS OF WOE THIS MORN I CAME
AND STILL IN MY FIRST LIFE THUS JOURNEYING ON
THE OTHER STRIVE TO GAIN SOON AS THEY HEARD
MY WORDS HE AND SORDELLO BACKWARD DREW
AS SUDDENLY AMAZ'D
TO VIRGIL ONE
THE OTHER TO A SPIRIT TURN'D WHO NEAR
WAS SEATED CRYING CONRAD UP WITH SPEED
COME SEE WHAT OF HIS GRACE HIGH GOD HATH WILL'D
THEN TURNING ROUND TO ME BY THAT RARE MARK
OF HONOUR WHICH THOU OW'ST TO HIM WHO HIDES
SO DEEPLY HIS FIRST CAUSE IT HATH NO FORD
WHEN THOU SHALT BE BEYOND THE VAST OF WAVES
TELL MY GIOVANNA THAT FOR ME SHE CALL
THERE WHERE REPLY TO INNOCENCE IS MADE
HER MOTHER I BELIEVE LOVES ME NO MORE
SINCE SHE HAS CHANG'D THE WHITE AND WIMPLED FOLDS
WHICH SHE IS DOOM'D ONCE MORE WITH GRIEF TO WISH
BY HER IT EASILY MAY BE PERCEIV'D
HOW LONG IN WOMEN LASTS THE FLAME OF LOVE
IF SIGHT AND TOUCH DO NOT RELUME IT OFT
FOR HER SO FAIR A BURIAL WILL NOT MAKE
THE VIPER WHICH CALLS MILAN TO THE FIELD
AS HAD BEEN MADE BY SHRILL GALLURA'S BIRD
HE SPOKE AND IN HIS VISAGE TOOK THE STAMP
OF THAT RIGHT SEAL WHICH WITH DUE TEMPERATURE
GLOWS IN THE BOSOM
MY INSATIATE EYES
MEANWHILE TO HEAV'N HAD TRAVEL'D EVEN THERE
WHERE THE BRIGHT STARS ARE SLOWEST AS A WHEEL
NEAREST THE AXLE WHEN MY GUIDE INQUIR'D
WHAT THERE ALOFT MY SON HAS CAUGHT THY GAZE
I ANSWER'D THE THREE TORCHES WITH WHICH HERE
THE POLE IS ALL ON FIRE HE THEN TO ME
THE FOUR RESPLENDENT STARS THOU SAW'ST THIS MORN
ARE THERE BENEATH AND THESE RIS'N IN THEIR STEAD
WHILE YET HE SPOKE
SORDELLO TO HIMSELF
DREW HIM AND CRY'D LO THERE OUR ENEMY
AND WITH HIS HAND POINTED THAT WAY TO LOOK
ALONG THE SIDE WHERE BARRIER NONE AROSE
AROUND THE LITTLE VALE A SERPENT LAY
SUCH HAPLY AS GAVE EVE THE BITTER FOOD
BETWEEN THE GRASS AND FLOWERS THE EVIL SNAKE
CAME ON REVERTING OFT HIS LIFTED HEAD
AND AS A BEAST THAT SMOOTHES ITS POLISH'D COAT
LICKING HIS HACK
I SAW NOT NOR CAN TELL
HOW THOSE CELESTIAL FALCONS FROM THEIR SEAT
MOV'D BUT IN MOTION EACH ONE WELL DESCRIED
HEARING THE AIR CUT BY THEIR VERDANT PLUMES
THE SERPENT FLED AND TO THEIR STATIONS BACK
THE ANGELS UP RETURN'D WITH EQUAL FLIGHT
THE SPIRIT WHO TO NINO WHEN HE CALL'D
HAD COME FROM VIEWING ME WITH FIXED KEN
THROUGH ALL THAT CONFLICT LOOSEN'D NOT HIS SIGHT
SO MAY THE LAMP WHICH LEADS THEE UP ON HIGH
FIND IN THY DESTIN'D LOT OF WAX SO MUCH
AS MAY SUFFICE THEE TO THE ENAMEL'S HEIGHT
IT THUS BEGAN IF ANY CERTAIN NEWS
OF VALDIMAGRA AND THE NEIGHBOUR PART
THOU KNOW'ST TELL ME WHO ONCE WAS MIGHTY THERE
THEY CALL'D ME CONRAD MALASPINA NOT
THAT OLD ONE BUT FROM HIM I SPRANG
THE LOVE
I BORE MY PEOPLE IS NOW HERE REFIN'D
IN YOUR DOMINIONS I ANSWER'D NE'ER WAS I
BUT THROUGH ALL EUROPE WHERE DO THOSE MEN DWELL
TO WHOM THEIR GLORY IS NOT MANIFEST
THE FAME THAT HONOURS YOUR ILLUSTRIOUS HOUSE
PROCLAIMS THE NOBLES AND PROCLAIMS THE LAND
SO THAT HE KNOWS IT WHO WAS NEVER THERE
I SWEAR TO YOU SO MAY MY UPWARD ROUTE
PROSPER YOUR HONOUR'D NATION NOT IMPAIRS
THE VALUE OF HER COFFER AND HER SWORD
NATURE AND USE GIVE HER SUCH PRIVILEGE
THAT WHILE THE WORLD IS TWISTED FROM HIS COURSE
BY A BAD HEAD SHE ONLY WALKS ARIGHT
AND HAS THE EVIL WAY IN SCORN HE THEN
NOW PASS THEE ON SEV'N TIMES THE TIRED SUN
REVISITS NOT THE COUCH WHICH WITH FOUR FEET
THE FORKED ARIES COVERS ERE THAT KIND
OPINION SHALL BE NAIL'D INTO THY BRAIN
WITH STRONGER NAILS THAN OTHER'S SPEECH CAN DRIVE
IF THE SURE COURSE OF JUDGMENT BE NOT STAY'D
CANTO IX
NOW THE FAIR CONSORT OF TITHONUS OLD
ARISEN FROM HER MATE'S BELOVED ARMS
LOOK'D PALELY O'ER THE EASTERN CLIFF HER BROW
LUCENT WITH JEWELS GLITTER'D SET IN SIGN
OF THAT CHILL ANIMAL WHO WITH HIS TRAIN
SMITES FEARFUL NATIONS AND WHERE THEN WE WERE
TWO STEPS OF HER ASCENT THE NIGHT HAD PAST
AND NOW THE THIRD WAS CLOSING UP ITS WING
WHEN I WHO HAD SO MUCH OF ADAM WITH ME
SANK DOWN UPON THE GRASS O'ERCOME WITH SLEEP
THERE WHERE ALL FIVE WERE SEATED
IN THAT HOUR
WHEN NEAR THE DAWN THE SWALLOW HER SAD LAY
REMEMB'RING HAPLY ANCIENT GRIEF RENEWS
AND WITH OUR MINDS MORE WAND'RERS FROM THE FLESH
AND LESS BY THOUGHT RESTRAIN'D ARE AS 'T WERE FULL
OF HOLY DIVINATION IN THEIR DREAMS
THEN IN A VISION DID I SEEM TO VIEW
A GOLDEN FEATHER'D EAGLE IN THE SKY
WITH OPEN WINGS AND HOV'RING FOR DESCENT
AND I WAS IN THAT PLACE METHOUGHT FROM WHENCE
YOUNG GANYMEDE FROM HIS ASSOCIATES 'REFT
WAS SNATCH'D ALOFT TO THE HIGH CONSISTORY
PERHAPS THOUGHT I WITHIN ME HERE ALONE
HE STRIKES HIS QUARRY AND ELSEWHERE DISDAINS
TO POUNCE UPON THE PREY THEREWITH IT SEEM'D
A LITTLE WHEELING IN HIS AIRY TOUR
TERRIBLE AS THE LIGHTNING RUSH'D HE DOWN
AND SNATCH'D ME UPWARD EVEN TO THE FIRE
THERE BOTH I THOUGHT THE EAGLE AND MYSELF
DID BURN AND SO INTENSE TH' IMAGIN'D FLAMES
THAT NEEDS MY SLEEP WAS BROKEN OFF
AS ERST
ACHILLES SHOOK HIMSELF AND ROUND HIM ROLL'D
HIS WAKEN'D EYEBALLS WOND'RING WHERE HE WAS
WHENAS HIS MOTHER HAD FROM CHIRON FLED
TO SCYROS WITH HIM SLEEPING IN HER ARMS
E'EN THUS I SHOOK ME SOON AS FROM MY FACE
THE SLUMBER PARTED TURNING DEADLY PALE
LIKE ONE ICE STRUCK WITH DREAD
SOLO AT MY SIDE
MY COMFORT STOOD AND THE BRIGHT SUN WAS NOW
MORE THAN TWO HOURS ALOFT AND TO THE SEA
MY LOOKS WERE TURN'D
FEAR NOT MY MASTER CRIED
ASSUR'D WE ARE AT HAPPY POINT
THY STRENGTH
SHRINK NOT BUT RISE DILATED
THOU ART COME
TO PURGATORY NOW
LO THERE THE CLIFF
THAT CIRCLING BOUNDS IT LO THE ENTRANCE THERE
WHERE IT DOTH SEEM DISPARTED RE THE DAWN
USHER'D THE DAYLIGHT WHEN THY WEARIED SOUL
SLEPT IN THEE O'ER THE FLOWERY VALE BENEATH
A LADY CAME AND THUS BESPAKE ME I
AM LUCIA
SUFFER ME TO TAKE THIS MAN
WHO SLUMBERS
EASIER SO HIS WAY SHALL SPEED
SORDELLO AND THE OTHER GENTLE SHAPES
TARRYING SHE BARE THEE UP AND AS DAY SHONE
THIS SUMMIT REACH'D AND I PURSUED HER STEPS
HERE DID SHE PLACE THEE
FIRST HER LOVELY EYES
THAT OPEN ENTRANCE SHOW'D ME THEN AT ONCE
SHE VANISH'D WITH THY SLEEP
LIKE ONE WHOSE DOUBTS
ARE CHAS'D BY CERTAINTY AND TERROR TURN'D
TO COMFORT ON DISCOVERY OF THE TRUTH
SUCH WAS THE CHANGE IN ME AND AS MY GUIDE
BEHELD ME FEARLESS UP ALONG THE CLIFF
HE MOV'D AND I BEHIND HIM TOWARDS THE HEIGHT
READER THOU MARKEST HOW MY THEME DOTH RISE
NOR WONDER THEREFORE IF MORE ARTFULLY
I PROP THE STRUCTURE NEARER NOW WE DREW
ARRIV'D' WHENCE IN THAT PART WHERE FIRST A BREACH
AS OF A WALL APPEAR'D I COULD DESCRY
A PORTAL AND THREE STEPS BENEATH THAT LED
FOR INLET THERE OF DIFFERENT COLOUR EACH
AND ONE WHO WATCH'D BUT SPAKE NOT YET A WORD
AS MORE AND MORE MINE EYE DID STRETCH ITS VIEW
I MARK'D HIM SEATED ON THE HIGHEST STEP
IN VISAGE SUCH AS PAST MY POWER TO BEAR
GRASP'D IN HIS HAND A NAKED SWORD GLANC'D BACK
THE RAYS SO TOWARD ME THAT I OFT IN VAIN
MY SIGHT DIRECTED
SPEAK FROM WHENCE YE STAND
HE CRIED WHAT WOULD YE WHERE IS YOUR ESCORT
TAKE HEED YOUR COMING UPWARD HARM YE NOT
A HEAVENLY DAME NOT SKILLESS OF THESE THINGS
REPLIED THE' INSTRUCTOR TOLD US EVEN NOW
PASS THAT WAY HERE THE GATE IS AND MAY SHE
BEFRIENDING PROSPER YOUR ASCENT RESUM'D
THE COURTEOUS KEEPER OF THE GATE COME THEN
BEFORE OUR STEPS WE STRAIGHTWAY THITHER CAME
THE LOWEST STAIR WAS MARBLE WHITE SO SMOOTH
AND POLISH'D THAT THEREIN MY MIRROR'D FORM
DISTINCT I SAW
THE NEXT OF HUE MORE DARK
THAN SABLEST GRAIN A ROUGH AND SINGED BLOCK
CRACK'D LENGTHWISE AND ACROSS
THE THIRD THAT LAY
MASSY ABOVE SEEM'D PORPHYRY THAT FLAM'D
RED AS THE LIFE BLOOD SPOUTING FROM A VEIN
ON THIS GOD'S ANGEL EITHER FOOT SUSTAIN'D
UPON THE THRESHOLD SEATED WHICH APPEAR'D
A ROCK OF DIAMOND
UP THE TRINAL STEPS
MY LEADER CHEERILY DREW ME
ASK SAID HE
WITH HUMBLE HEART THAT HE UNBAR THE BOLT
PIOUSLY AT HIS HOLY FEET DEVOLV'D
I CAST ME PRAYING HIM FOR PITY'S SAKE
THAT HE WOULD OPEN TO ME BUT FIRST FELL
THRICE ON MY BOSOM PROSTRATE
SEVEN TIMES
THE LETTER THAT DENOTES THE INWARD STAIN
HE ON MY FOREHEAD WITH THE BLUNTED POINT
OF HIS DRAWN SWORD INSCRIB'D
AND LOOK HE CRIED
WHEN ENTER'D THAT THOU WASH THESE SCARS AWAY
ASHES OR EARTH TA'EN DRY OUT OF THE GROUND
WERE OF ONE COLOUR WITH THE ROBE HE WORE
FROM UNDERNEATH THAT VESTMENT FORTH HE DREW
TWO KEYS OF METAL TWAIN THE ONE WAS GOLD
ITS FELLOW SILVER
WITH THE PALLID FIRST
AND NEXT THE BURNISH'D HE SO PLY'D THE GATE
AS TO CONTENT ME WELL
WHENEVER ONE
FAILETH OF THESE THAT IN THE KEYHOLE STRAIGHT
IT TURN NOT TO THIS ALLEY THEN EXPECT
ACCESS IN VAIN SUCH WERE THE WORDS HE SPAKE
ONE IS MORE PRECIOUS BUT THE OTHER NEEDS
SKILL AND SAGACITY LARGE SHARE OF EACH
ERE ITS GOOD TASK TO DISENGAGE THE KNOT
BE WORTHILY PERFORM'D
FROM PETER THESE
I HOLD OF HIM INSTRUCTED THAT I ERR
RATHER IN OPENING THAN IN KEEPING FAST
SO BUT THE SUPPLIANT AT MY FEET IMPLORE
THEN OF THAT HALLOW'D GATE HE THRUST THE DOOR
EXCLAIMING ENTER BUT THIS WARNING HEAR
HE FORTH AGAIN DEPARTS WHO LOOKS BEHIND
AS IN THE HINGES OF THAT SACRED WARD
THE SWIVELS TURN'D SONOROUS METAL STRONG
HARSH WAS THE GRATING NOR SO SURLILY
ROAR'D THE TARPEIAN WHEN BY FORCE BEREFT
OF GOOD METELLUS THENCEFORTH FROM HIS LOSS
TO LEANNESS DOOM'D
ATTENTIVELY I TURN'D
LIST'NING THE THUNDER THAT FIRST ISSUED FORTH
AND WE PRAISE THEE O GOD METHOUGHT I HEARD
IN ACCENTS BLENDED WITH SWEET MELODY
THE STRAINS CAME O'ER MINE EAR E'EN AS THE SOUND
OF CHORAL VOICES THAT IN SOLEMN CHANT
WITH ORGAN MINGLE AND NOW HIGH AND CLEAR
COME SWELLING NOW FLOAT INDISTINCT AWAY
CANTO X
WHEN WE HAD PASSED THE THRESHOLD OF THE GATE
WHICH THE SOUL'S ILL AFFECTION DOTH DISUSE
MAKING THE CROOKED SEEM THE STRAIGHTER PATH
I HEARD ITS CLOSING SOUND
HAD MINE EYES TURN'D
FOR THAT OFFENCE WHAT PLEA MIGHT HAVE AVAIL'D
WE MOUNTED UP THE RIVEN ROCK THAT WOUND
ON EITHER SIDE ALTERNATE AS THE WAVE
FLIES AND ADVANCES
HERE SOME LITTLE ART
BEHOOVES US SAID MY LEADER THAT OUR STEPS
OBSERVE THE VARYING FLEXURE OF THE PATH
THUS WE SO SLOWLY SPED THAT WITH CLEFT ORB
THE MOON ONCE MORE O'ERHANGS HER WAT'RY COUCH
ERE WE THAT STRAIT HAVE THREADED
BUT WHEN FREE
WE CAME AND OPEN WHERE THE MOUNT ABOVE
ONE SOLID MASS RETIRES I SPENT WITH TOIL
AND BOTH UNCERTAIN OF THE WAY WE STOOD
UPON A PLAIN MORE LONESOME THAN THE ROADS
THAT TRAVERSE DESERT WILDS
FROM WHENCE THE BRINK
BORDERS UPON VACUITY TO FOOT
OF THE STEEP BANK THAT RISES STILL THE SPACE
HAD MEASUR'D THRICE THE STATURE OF A MAN
AND DISTANT AS MINE EYE COULD WING ITS FLIGHT
TO LEFTWARD NOW AND NOW TO RIGHT DISPATCH'D
THAT CORNICE EQUAL IN EXTENT APPEAR'D
NOT YET OUR FEET HAD ON THAT SUMMIT MOV'D
WHEN I DISCOVER'D THAT THE BANK AROUND
WHOSE PROUD UPRISING ALL ASCENT DENIED
WAS MARBLE WHITE AND SO EXACTLY WROUGHT
WITH QUAINTEST SCULPTURE THAT NOT THERE ALONE
HAD POLYCLETUS BUT E'EN NATURE'S SELF
BEEN SHAM'D
THE ANGEL WHO CAME DOWN TO EARTH
WITH TIDINGS OF THE PEACE SO MANY YEARS
WEPT FOR IN VAIN THAT OP'D THE HEAVENLY GATES
FROM THEIR LONG INTERDICT BEFORE US SEEM'D
IN A SWEET ACT SO SCULPTUR'D TO THE LIFE
HE LOOK'D NO SILENT IMAGE
ONE HAD SWORN
HE HAD SAID HAIL FOR SHE WAS IMAG'D THERE
BY WHOM THE KEY DID OPEN TO GOD'S LOVE
AND IN HER ACT AS SENSIBLY IMPRESS
THAT WORD BEHOLD THE HANDMAID OF THE LORD
AS FIGURE SEAL'D ON WAX
FIX NOT THY MIND
ON ONE PLACE ONLY SAID THE GUIDE BELOV'D
WHO HAD ME NEAR HIM ON THAT PART WHERE LIES
THE HEART OF MAN
MY SIGHT FORTHWITH I TURN'D
AND MARK'D BEHIND THE VIRGIN MOTHER'S FORM
UPON THAT SIDE WHERE HE THAT MOV'D ME STOOD
ANOTHER STORY GRAVEN ON THE ROCK
I PASSED ATHWART THE BARD AND DREW ME NEAR
THAT IT MIGHT STAND MORE APTLY FOR MY VIEW
THERE IN THE SELF SAME MARBLE WERE ENGRAV'D
THE CART AND KINE DRAWING THE SACRED ARK
THAT FROM UNBIDDEN OFFICE AWES MANKIND
BEFORE IT CAME MUCH PEOPLE AND THE WHOLE
PARTED IN SEVEN QUIRES
ONE SENSE CRIED NAY
ANOTHER YES THEY SING LIKE DOUBT AROSE
BETWIXT THE EYE AND SMELL FROM THE CURL'D FUME
OF INCENSE BREATHING UP THE WELL WROUGHT TOIL
PRECEDING THE BLEST VESSEL ONWARD CAME
WITH LIGHT DANCE LEAPING GIRT IN HUMBLE GUISE
SWEET ISRAEL'S HARPER IN THAT HAP HE SEEM'D
LESS AND YET MORE THAN KINGLY
OPPOSITE
AT A GREAT PALACE FROM THE LATTICE FORTH
LOOK'D MICHOL LIKE A LADY FULL OF SCORN
AND SORROW
TO BEHOLD THE TABLET NEXT
WHICH AT THE HACK OF MICHOL WHITELY SHONE
I MOV'D ME
THERE WAS STORIED ON THE ROCK
THE' EXALTED GLORY OF THE ROMAN PRINCE
WHOSE MIGHTY WORTH MOV'D GREGORY TO EARN
HIS MIGHTY CONQUEST TRAJAN TH' EMPEROR
A WIDOW AT HIS BRIDLE STOOD ATTIR'D
IN TEARS AND MOURNING
ROUND ABOUT THEM TROOP'D
FULL THRONG OF KNIGHTS AND OVERHEAD IN GOLD
THE EAGLES FLOATED STRUGGLING WITH THE WIND
THE WRETCH APPEAR'D AMID ALL THESE TO SAY
GRANT VENGEANCE SIRE FOR WOE BESHREW THIS HEART
MY SON IS MURDER'D HE REPLYING SEEM'D
WAIT NOW TILL I RETURN AND SHE AS ONE
MADE HASTY BY HER GRIEF O SIRE IF THOU

SHAPES YET MORE PRECIOUS FOR THEIR ARTIST'S SAKE
WHEN LO THE POET WHISPER'D WHERE THIS WAY

WHY BUOY YE UP ALOFT YOUR UNFLEG'D SOULS
ABORTIVE THEN AND SHAPELESS YE REMAIN
LIKE THE UNTIMELY EMBRYON OF A WORM
AS TO SUPPORT INCUMBENT FLOOR OR ROOF
FOR CORBEL IS A FIGURE SOMETIMES SEEN

WITH THE FEIGN'D POSTURE STIRRING RUTH UNFEIGN'D
IN THE BEHOLDER'S FANCY SO I SAW
THESE FASHION'D WHEN I NOTED WELL THEIR GUISE

OR MORE OR LESS CONTRACT BUT IT APPEAR'D

THIS LAST PETITION DEAREST LORD IS MADE
NOT FOR OURSELVES SINCE THAT WERE NEEDLESS NOW

THOSE SPIRITS WENT BENEATH A WEIGHT LIKE THAT

HOLDING HIS EYES WITH DIFFICULTY FIX'D
INTENT UPON ME STOOPING AS I WENT
COMPANION OF THEIR WAY
O I EXCLAIM'D
ART THOU NOT ODERIGI ART NOT THOU
AGOBBIO'S GLORY GLORY OF THAT ART
WHICH THEY OF PARIS CALL THE LIMMER'S SKILL
BROTHER SAID HE WITH TINTS THAT GAYER SMILE
BOLOGNIAN FRANCO'S PENCIL LINES THE LEAVES
HIS ALL THE HONOUR NOW MINE BORROW'D LIGHT
IN TRUTH I HAD NOT BEEN THUS COURTEOUS TO HIM
THE WHILST I LIV'D THROUGH EAGERNESS OF ZEAL
FOR THAT PRE EMINENCE MY HEART WAS BENT ON
HERE OF SUCH PRIDE THE FORFEITURE IS PAID
NOR WERE I EVEN HERE IF ABLE STILL
TO SIN I HAD NOT TURN'D ME UNTO GOD
O POWERS OF MAN HOW VAIN YOUR GLORY NIPP'D
E'EN IN ITS HEIGHT OF VERDURE IF AN AGE
LESS BRIGHT SUCCEED NOT IMBUE THOUGHT
TO LORD IT OVER PAINTING'S FIELD AND NOW
THE CRY IS GIOTTO'S AND HIS NAME ECLIPS'D
THUS HATH ONE GUIDO FROM THE OTHER SNATCH'D
THE LETTER'D PRIZE AND HE PERHAPS IS BORN
WHO SHALL DRIVE EITHER FROM THEIR NEST
THE NOISE
OF WORLDLY FAME IS BUT A BLAST OF WIND
THAT BLOWS FROM DIVERS POINTS AND SHIFTS ITS NAME
SHIFTING THE POINT IT BLOWS FROM
SHALT THOU MORE
LIVE IN THE MOUTHS OF MANKIND IF THY FLESH
PART SHRIVEL'D FROM THEE THAN IF THOU HADST DIED
BEFORE THE CORAL AND THE PAP WERE LEFT
OR ERE SOME THOUSAND YEARS HAVE PASSED AND THAT
IS TO ETERNITY COMPAR'D A SPACE
BRIEFER THAN IS THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
TO THE HEAVEN'S SLOWEST ORB
HE THERE WHO TREADS
SO LEISURELY BEFORE ME FAR AND WIDE
THROUGH TUSCANY RESOUNDED ONCE AND NOW
IS IN SIENNA SCARCE WITH WHISPERS NAM'D
THERE WAS HE SOV'REIGN WHEN DESTRUCTION CAUGHT
THE MADD'NING RAGE OF FLORENCE IN THAT DAY
PROUD AS SHE NOW IS LOATHSOME
YOUR RENOWN
IS AS THE HERB WHOSE HUE DOTH COME AND GO
AND HIS MIGHT WITHERS IT BY WHOM IT SPRANG
CRUDE FROM THE LAP OF EARTH I THUS TO HIM
TRUE ARE THY SAYINGS TO MY HEART THEY BREATHE
THE KINDLY SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS AND ALLAY
WHAT TUMOURS RANKLE THERE
BUT WHO IS HE
OF WHOM THOU SPAK'ST BUT NOW THIS HE REPLIED
IS PROVENZANO
HE IS HERE BECAUSE
HE REACH'D WITH GRASP PRESUMPTUOUS AT THE SWAY
OF ALL SIENNA
THUS HE STILL HATH GONE
THUS GOETH NEVER RESTING SINCE HE DIED
SUCH IS TH' ACQUITTANCE RENDER'D BACK OF HIM
WHO BEYOND MEASURE DAR'D ON EARTH I THEN
IF SOUL THAT TO THE VERGE OF LIFE DELAYS
REPENTANCE LINGER IN THAT LOWER SPACE
NOR HITHER MOUNT UNLESS GOOD PRAYERS BEFRIEND
HOW CHANC'D ADMITTANCE WAS VOUCHSAF'D TO HIM
WHEN AT HIS GLORY'S TOPMOST HEIGHT SAID HE
RESPECT OF DIGNITY ALL CAST ASIDE
FREELY HE FIX'D HIM ON SIENNA'S PLAIN
A SUITOR TO REDEEM HIS SUFF'RING FRIEND
WHO LANGUISH'D IN THE PRISON HOUSE OF CHARLES
NOR FOR HIS SAKE REFUS'D THROUGH EVERY VEIN
TO TREMBLE
MORE I WILL NOT SAY AND DARK
I KNOW MY WORDS ARE BUT THY NEIGHBOURS SOON
SHALL HELP THEE TO A COMMENT ON THE TEXT
THIS IS THE WORK THAT FROM THESE LIMITS FREED HIM
CANTO XII
WITH EQUAL PACE AS OXEN IN THE YOKE
I WITH THAT LADEN SPIRIT JOURNEY'D ON
LONG AS THE MILD INSTRUCTOR SUFFER'D ME
BUT WHEN HE BADE ME QUIT HIM AND PROCEED
FOR HERE SAID HE BEHOOVES WITH SAIL AND OARS
EACH MAN AS BEST HE MAY PUSH ON HIS BARK
UPRIGHT AS ONE DISPOS'D FOR SPEED I RAIS'D
MY BODY STILL IN THOUGHT SUBMISSIVE BOW'D
I NOW MY LEADER'S TRACK NOT LOTH PURSUED
AND EACH HAD SHOWN HOW LIGHT WE FAR'D ALONG
WHEN THUS HE WARN'D ME BEND THINE EYESIGHT DOWN
FOR THOU TO EASE THE WAY SHALL FIND IT GOOD
TO RUMINATE THE BED BENEATH THY FEET
AS IN MEMORIAL OF THE BURIED DRAWN
UPON EARTH LEVEL TOMBS THE SCULPTUR'D FORM
OF WHAT WAS ONCE APPEARS AT SIGHT WHEREOF
TEARS OFTEN STREAM FORTH BY REMEMBRANCE WAK'D
WHOSE SACRED STINGS THE PITEOUS ONLY FEEL
SO SAW I THERE BUT WITH MORE CURIOUS SKILL
OF PORTRAITURE O'ERWROUGHT WHATE'ER OF SPACE
FROM FORTH THE MOUNTAIN STRETCHES
ON ONE PART
HIM I BEHELD ABOVE ALL CREATURES ERST
CREATED NOBLEST LIGHT'NING FALL FROM HEAVEN
ON TH' OTHER SIDE WITH BOLT CELESTIAL PIERC'D
BRIAREUS CUMB'RING EARTH HE LAY THROUGH DINT
OF MORTAL ICE STROKE
THE THYMBRAEAN GOD
WITH MARS I SAW AND PALLAS ROUND THEIR SIRE
ARM'D STILL AND GAZING ON THE GIANT'S LIMBS
STREWN O'ER TH' ETHEREAL FIELD
NIMROD I SAW
AT FOOT OF THE STUPENDOUS WORK HE STOOD
AS IF BEWILDER'D LOOKING ON THE CROWD
LEAGUED IN HIS PROUD ATTEMPT ON SENNAAR'S PLAIN
O NIOBE IN WHAT A TRANCE OF WOE
THEE I BEHELD UPON THAT HIGHWAY DRAWN
SEV'N SONS ON EITHER SIDE THEE SLAIN SAUL
HOW GHASTLY DIDST THOU LOOK ON THINE OWN SWORD
EXPIRING IN GILBOA FROM THAT HOUR
NE'ER VISITED WITH RAIN FROM HEAV'N OR DEW
O FOND ARACHNE THEE I ALSO SAW
HALF SPIDER NOW IN ANGUISH CRAWLING UP
TH' UNFINISH'D WEB THOU WEAVED'ST TO THY BANE
O REHOBOAM HERE THY SHAPE DOTH SEEM
LOURING NO MORE DEFIANCE BUT FEAR SMOTE
WITH NONE TO CHASE HIM IN HIS CHARIOT WHIRL'D
WAS SHOWN BESIDE UPON THE SOLID FLOOR
HOW DEAR ALCMAEON FORC'D HIS MOTHER RATE
THAT ORNAMENT IN EVIL HOUR RECEIV'D
HOW IN THE TEMPLE ON SENNACHERIB FELL
HIS SONS AND HOW A CORPSE THEY LEFT HIM THERE
WAS SHOWN THE SCATH AND CRUEL MANGLING MADE
BY TOMYRIS ON CYRUS WHEN SHE CRIED
BLOOD THOU DIDST THIRST FOR TAKE THY FILL OF BLOOD
WAS SHOWN HOW ROUTED IN THE BATTLE FLED
TH' ASSYRIANS HOLOFERNES SLAIN AND E'EN
THE RELICS OF THE CARNAGE
TROY I MARK'D
IN ASHES AND IN CAVERNS
OH HOW FALL'N
HOW ABJECT ILION WAS THY SEMBLANCE THERE
WHAT MASTER OF THE PENCIL OR THE STYLE
HAD TRAC'D THE SHADES AND LINES THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE
THE SUBTLEST WORKMAN WONDER DEAD THE DEAD
THE LIVING SEEM'D ALIVE WITH CLEARER VIEW
HIS EYE BEHELD NOT WHO BEHELD THE TRUTH
THAN MINE WHAT I DID TREAD ON WHILE I WENT
LOW BENDING
NOW SWELL OUT AND WITH STIFF NECKS
PASS ON YE SONS OF EVE VEIL NOT YOUR LOOKS
LEST THEY DESCRY THE EVIL OF YOUR PATH
I NOTED NOT SO BUSIED WAS MY THOUGHT
HOW MUCH WE NOW HAD CIRCLED OF THE MOUNT
AND OF HIS COURSE YET MORE THE SUN HAD SPENT
WHEN HE WHO WITH STILL WAKEFUL CAUTION WENT
ADMONISH'D RAISE THOU UP THY HEAD FOR KNOW
TIME IS NOT NOW FOR SLOW SUSPENSE
BEHOLD
THAT WAY AN ANGEL HASTING TOWARDS US LO
WHERE DULY THE SIXTH HANDMAID DOTH RETURN
FROM SERVICE ON THE DAY
WEAR THOU IN LOOK
AND GESTURE SEEMLY GRACE OF REVERENT AWE
THAT GLADLY HE MAY FORWARD US ALOFT
CONSIDER THAT THIS DAY NE'ER DAWNS AGAIN
TIME'S LOSS HE HAD SO OFTEN WARN'D ME 'GAINST
I COULD NOT MISS THE SCOPE AT WHICH HE AIM'D
THE GOODLY SHAPE APPROACH'D US SNOWY WHITE
IN VESTURE AND WITH VISAGE CASTING STREAMS
OF TREMULOUS LUSTRE LIKE THE MATIN STAR
HIS ARMS HE OPEN'D THEN HIS WINGS AND SPAKE
ONWARD THE STEPS BEHOLD ARE NEAR AND NOW
TH' ASCENT IS WITHOUT DIFFICULTY GAIN'D
A SCANTY FEW ARE THEY WHO WHEN THEY HEAR
SUCH TIDINGS HASTEN
O YE RACE OF MEN
THOUGH BORN TO SOAR WHY SUFFER YE A WIND
SO SLIGHT TO BAFFLE YE HE LED US ON
WHERE THE ROCK PARTED HERE AGAINST MY FRONT
DID BEAT HIS WINGS THEN PROMIS'D I SHOULD FARE
IN SAFETY ON MY WAY
AS TO ASCEND
THAT STEEP UPON WHOSE BROW THE CHAPEL STANDS
O'ER RUBACONTE LOOKING LORDLY DOWN
ON THE WELL GUIDED CITY UP THE RIGHT
TH' IMPETUOUS RISE IS BROKEN BY THE STEPS
CARV'D IN THAT OLD AND SIMPLE AGE WHEN STILL
THE REGISTRY AND LABEL RESTED SAFE
THUS IS TH' ACCLIVITY RELIEV'D WHICH HERE
PRECIPITOUS FROM THE OTHER CIRCUIT FALLS
BUT ON EACH HAND THE TALL CLIFF PRESSES CLOSE
AS ENT'RING THERE WE TURN'D VOICES IN STRAIN
INEFFABLE SANG BLESSED ARE THE POOR
IN SPIRIT AH HOW FAR UNLIKE TO THESE
THE STRAITS OF HELL HERE SONGS TO USHER US
THERE SHRIEKS OF WOE WE CLIMB THE HOLY STAIRS
AND LIGHTER TO MYSELF BY FAR I SEEM'D
THAN ON THE PLAIN BEFORE WHENCE THUS I SPAKE
SAY MASTER OF WHAT HEAVY THING HAVE I
BEEN LIGHTEN'D THAT SCARCE AUGHT THE SENSE OF TOIL
AFFECTS ME JOURNEYING HE IN FEW REPLIED
WHEN SIN'S BROAD CHARACTERS THAT YET REMAIN
UPON THY TEMPLES THOUGH WELL NIGH EFFAC'D
SHALL BE AS ONE IS ALL CLEAN RAZED OUT
THEN SHALL THY FEET BY HEARTINESS OF WILL
BE SO O'ERCOME THEY NOT ALONE SHALL FEEL
NO SENSE OF LABOUR BUT DELIGHT MUCH MORE
SHALL WAIT THEM URG'D ALONG THEIR UPWARD WAY
THEN LIKE TO ONE UPON WHOSE HEAD IS PLAC'D
SOMEWHAT HE DEEMS NOT OF BUT FROM THE BECKS
OF OTHERS AS THEY PASS HIM BY HIS HAND
LENDS THEREFORE HELP TO' ASSURE HIM SEARCHES FINDS
AND WELL PERFORMS SUCH OFFICE AS THE EYE
WANTS POWER TO EXECUTE SO STRETCHING FORTH
THE FINGERS OF MY RIGHT HAND DID I FIND
SIX ONLY OF THE LETTERS WHICH HIS SWORD
WHO BARE THE KEYS HAD TRAC'D UPON MY BROW
THE LEADER AS HE MARK'D MINE ACTION SMIL'D
CANTO XIII
WE REACH'D THE SUMMIT OF THE SCALE AND STOOD
UPON THE SECOND BUTTRESS OF THAT MOUNT
WHICH HEALETH HIM WHO CLIMBS
A CORNICE THERE
LIKE TO THE FORMER GIRDLES ROUND THE HILL
SAVE THAT ITS ARCH WITH SWEEP LESS AMPLE BENDS
SHADOW NOR IMAGE THERE IS SEEN ALL SMOOTH
THE RAMPART AND THE PATH REFLECTING NOUGHT
BUT THE ROCK'S SULLEN HUE
IF HERE WE WAIT
FOR SOME TO QUESTION SAID THE BARD I FEAR
OUR CHOICE MAY HAPLY MEET TOO LONG DELAY
THEN FIXEDLY UPON THE SUN HIS EYES
HE FASTN'D MADE HIS RIGHT THE CENTRAL POINT
FROM WHENCE TO MOVE AND TURN'D THE LEFT ASIDE
O PLEASANT LIGHT MY CONFIDENCE AND HOPE
CONDUCT US THOU HE CRIED ON THIS NEW WAY
WHERE NOW I VENTURE LEADING TO THE BOURN
WE SEEK
THE UNIVERSAL WORLD TO THEE
OWES WARMTH AND LUSTRE
IF NO OTHER CAUSE
FORBID THY BEAMS SHOULD EVER BE OUR GUIDE
FAR AS IS MEASUR'D FOR A MILE ON EARTH
IN BRIEF SPACE HAD WE JOURNEY'D SUCH PROMPT WILL
IMPELL'D AND TOWARDS US FLYING NOW WERE HEARD
SPIRITS INVISIBLE WHO COURTEOUSLY
UNTO LOVE'S TABLE BADE THE WELCOME GUEST
THE VOICE THAT FIRSTLEW BY CALL'D FORTH ALOUD
THEY HAVE NO WINE SO ON BEHIND US PAST
THOSE SOUNDS REITERATING NOR YET LOST
IN THE FAINT DISTANCE WHEN ANOTHER CAME
CRYING I AM ORESTES AND ALIKE
WING'D ITS FLEET WAY
OH FATHER I EXCLAIM'D
WHAT TONGUES ARE THESE AND AS I QUESTION'D LO
A THIRD EXCLAIMING LOVE YE THOSE HAVE WRONG'D YOU
THIS CIRCUIT SAID MY TEACHER KNOTS THE SCOURGE
FOR ENVY AND THE CORDS ARE THEREFORE DRAWN
BY CHARITY'S CORRECTING HAND
THE CURB
IS OF A HARSHER SOUND AS THOU SHALT HEAR
IF I DEEM RIGHTLY ERE THOU REACH THE PASS
WHERE PARDON SETS THEM FREE
BUT FIX THINE EYES
INTENTLY THROUGH THE AIR AND THOU SHALT SEE
A MULTITUDE BEFORE THEE SEATED EACH
ALONG THE SHELVING GROT THEN MORE THAN ERST
I OP'D MY EYES BEFORE ME VIEW'D AND SAW
SHADOWS WITH GARMENTS DARK AS WAS THE ROCK
AND WHEN WE PASS'D A LITTLE FORTH I HEARD
A CRYING BLESSED MARY PRAY FOR US
MICHAEL AND PETER ALL YE SAINTLY HOST
I DO NOT THINK THERE WALKS ON EARTH THIS DAY
MAN SO REMORSELESS THAT HE HATH NOT YEARN'D
WITH PITY AT THE SIGHT THAT NEXT I SAW
MINE EYES A LOAD OF SORROW TEEMED WHEN NOW
I STOOD SO NEAR THEM THAT THEIR SEMBLANCES
CAME CLEARLY TO MY VIEW
OF SACKCLOTH VILE
THEIR COV'RING SEEM'D AND ON HIS SHOULDER ONE
DID STAY ANOTHER LEANING AND ALL LEAN'D
AGAINST THE CLIFF
E'EN THUS THE BLIND AND POOR
NEAR THE CONFESSIONALS TO CRAVE AN ALMS
STAND EACH HIS HEAD UPON HIS FELLOW'S SUNK
SO MOST TO STIR COMPASSION NOT BY SOUND
OF WORDS ALONE BUT THAT WHICH MOVES NOT LESS
THE SIGHT OF MIS'RY
AND AS NEVER BEAM
OF NOONDAY VISITETH THE EYELESS MAN
E'EN SO WAS HEAV'N A NIGGARD UNTO THESE
OF HIS FAIR LIGHT FOR THROUGH THE ORBS OF ALL
A THREAD OF WIRE IMPIERCING KNITS THEM UP
AS FOR THE TAMING OF A HAGGARD HAWK
IT WERE A WRONG METHOUGHT TO PASS AND LOOK
ON OTHERS YET MYSELF THE WHILE UNSEEN
TO MY SAGE COUNSEL THEREFORE DID I TURN
HE KNEW THE MEANING OF THE MUTE APPEAL
NOR WAITED FOR MY QUESTIONING BUT SAID
SPEAK AND BE BRIEF BE SUBTLE IN THY WORDS
ON THAT PART OF THE CORNICE WHENCE NO RIM
ENGARLANDS ITS STEEP FALL DID VIRGIL COME
ON THE' OTHER SIDE ME WERE THE SPIRITS THEIR CHEEKS
BATHING DEVOUT WITH PENITENTIAL TEARS
THAT THROUGH THE DREAD IMPALEMENT FORC'D A WAY
I TURN'D ME TO THEM AND O SHADES SAID I
ASSUR'D THAT TO YOUR EYES UNVEIL'D SHALL SHINE
THE LOFTY LIGHT SOLE OBJECT OF YOUR WISH
SO MAY HEAVEN'S GRACE CLEAR WHATSOE'ER OF FOAM
FLOATS TURBID ON THE CONSCIENCE THAT THENCEFORTH
THE STREAM OF MIND ROLL LIMPID FROM ITS SOURCE
AS YE DECLARE FOR SO SHALL YE IMPART
A BOON I DEARLY PRIZE IF ANY SOUL
OF LATIUM DWELL AMONG YE AND PERCHANCE
THAT SOUL MAY PROFIT IF I LEARN SO MUCH
MY BROTHER WE ARE EACH ONE CITIZENS
OF ONE TRUE CITY
ANY THOU WOULDST SAY
WHO LIVED A STRANGER IN ITALIA'S LAND
SO HEARD I ANSWERING AS APPEAL'D A VOICE
THAT ONWARD CAME SOME SPACE FROM WHENCE I STOOD
A SPIRIT I NOTED IN WHOSE LOOK WAS MARK'D
EXPECTANCE
ASK YE HOW THE CHIN WAS RAIS'D
AS IN ONE REFT OF SIGHT
SPIRIT SAID I
WHO FOR THY RISE ARE TUTORING IF THOU BE
THAT WHICH DIDST ANSWER TO ME OR BY PLACE
OR NAME DISCLOSE THYSELF THAT I MAY KNOW THEE
I WAS IT ANSWER'D OF SIENNA HERE
I CLEANSE AWAY WITH THESE THE EVIL LIFE
SOLICITING WITH TEARS THAT HE WHO IS
VOUCHSAFE HIM TO US
THOUGH SAPIA NAM'D
IN SAPIENCE I EXCELL'D NOT GLADDER FAR
OF OTHERS' HURT THAN OF THE GOOD BEFELL ME
THAT THOU MAYST OWN I NOW DECEIVE THEE NOT
HEAR IF MY FOLLY WERE NOT AS I SPEAK IT
WHEN NOW MY YEARS SLOP'D WANING DOWN THE ARCH
IT SO BECHANC'D MY FELLOW CITIZENS
NEAR COLLE MET THEIR ENEMIES IN THE FIELD
AND I PRAY'D GOD TO GRANT WHAT HE HAD WILL'D
THERE WERE THEY VANQUISH'D AND BETOOK THEMSELVES
UNTO THE BITTER PASSAGES OF FLIGHT
I MARK'D THE HUNT AND WAXING OUT OF BOUNDS
IN GLADNESS LIFTED UP MY SHAMELESS BROW
AND LIKE THE MERLIN CHEATED BY A GLEAM
CRIED IT IS OVER
HEAV'N FEAR THEE NOT
UPON MY VERGE OF LIFE I WISH'D FOR PEACE
WITH GOD NOR REPENTANCE HAD SUPPLIED
WHAT I DID LACK OF DUTY WERE IT NOT
THE HERMIT PIERO TOUCH'D WITH CHARITY
IN HIS DEVOUT ORISONS THOUGHT ON ME
BUT WHO ART THOU THAT QUESTION'ST OF OUR STATE
WHO GO'ST TO MY BELIEF WITH LIDS UNCLOS'D
AND BREATHEST IN THY TALK MINE EYES SAID I
MAY YET BE HERE TA'EN FROM ME BUT NOT LONG
FOR THEY HAVE NOT OFFENDED GRIEVOUSLY
WITH ENVIOUS GLANCES
BUT THE WOE BENEATH
URGES MY SOUL WITH MORE EXCEEDING DREAD
THAT NETHER LOAD ALREADY WEIGHS ME DOWN
SHE THUS WHO THEN AMONGST US HERE ALOFT
HATH BROUGHT THEE IF THOU WEENEST TO RETURN
HE ANSWER'D I WHO STANDETH MUTE BESIDE ME
I LIVE OF ME ASK THEREFORE CHOSEN SPIRIT
IF THOU DESIRE I YONDER YET SHOULD MOVE
FOR THEE MY MORTAL FEET OH SHE REPLIED
THIS IS SO STRANGE A THING IT IS GREAT SIGN
THAT GOD DOTH LOVE THEE
THEREFORE WITH THY PRAYER
SOMETIME ASSIST ME AND BY THAT I CRAVE
WHICH MOST THOU COVETEST THAT IF THY FEET
E'ER TREAD ON TUSCAN SOIL THOU SAVE MY FAME
AMONGST MY KINDRED
THEM SHALT THOU BEHOLD
WITH THAT VAIN MULTITUDE WHO SET THEIR HOPE
ON TELAMONE'S HAVEN THERE TO FAIL
CONFOUNDED MORE SHALL WHEN THE FANCIED STREAM
THEY SOUGHT OF DIAN CALL'D BUT THEY WHO LEAD
THEIR NAVIES MORE THAN RUIN'D HOPES SHALL MOURN
CANTO XIV
SAY WHO IS HE AROUND OUR MOUNTAIN WINDS
OR EVER DEATH HAS PRUN'D HIS WING FOR FLIGHT
THAT OPES HIS EYES AND COVERS THEM AT WILL
I KNOW NOT WHO HE IS BUT KNOW THUS MUCH
HE COMES NOT SINGLY
DO THOU ASK OF HIM
FOR THOU ART NEARER TO HIM AND TAKE HEED
ACCOST HIM GENTLY SO THAT HE MAY SPEAK
THUS ON THE RIGHT TWO SPIRITS BENDING EACH
TOWARD THE OTHER TALK'D OF ME THEN BOTH
ADDRESSING ME THEIR FACES BACKWARD LEAN'D
AND THUS THE ONE BEGAN O SOUL WHO YET
PENT IN THE BODY TENDEST TOWARDS THE SKY
FOR CHARITY WE PRAY THEE' COMFORT US
RECOUNTING WHENCE THOU COM'ST AND WHO THOU ART
FOR THOU DOST MAKE US AT THE FAVOUR SHOWN THEE
MARVEL AS AT A THING THAT NE'ER HATH BEEN
THERE STRETCHES THROUGH THE MIDST OF TUSCANY
I STRAIGHT BEGAN A BROOKLET WHOSE WELL HEAD
SPRINGS UP IN FALTERONA WITH HIS RACE
NOT SATISFIED WHEN HE SOME HUNDRED MILES
HATH MEASUR'D
FROM HIS BANKS BRING I THIS FRAME
TO TELL YOU WHO I AM WERE WORDS MISSPENT
FOR YET MY NAME SCARCE SOUNDS ON RUMOUR'S LIP
IF WELL I DO INCORP'RATE WITH MY THOUGHT
THE MEANING OF THY SPEECH SAID HE WHO FIRST
ADDREST ME THOU DOST SPEAK OF ARNO'S WAVE
TO WHOM THE OTHER WHY HATH HE CONCEAL'D
THE TITLE OF THAT RIVER AS A MAN
DOTH OF SOME HORRIBLE THING THE SPIRIT WHO
THEREOF WAS QUESTION'D DID ACQUIT HIM THUS
I KNOW NOT BUT 'TIS FITTING WELL THE NAME
SHOULD PERISH OF THAT VALE FOR FROM THE SOURCE
WHERE TEEMS SO PLENTEOUSLY THE ALPINE STEEP
MAIM'D OF PELORUS THAT DOTH SCARCELY PASS
BEYOND THAT LIMIT EVEN TO THE POINT
WHEREUNTO OCEAN IS RESTOR'D WHAT HEAVEN
DRAINS FROM TH' EXHAUSTLESS STORE FOR ALL EARTH'S STREAMS
THROUGHOUT THE SPACE IS VIRTUE WORRIED DOWN
AS 'TWERE A SNAKE BY ALL FOR MORTAL FOE
OR THROUGH DISASTROUS INFLUENCE ON THE PLACE
OR ELSE DISTORTION OF MISGUIDED WILLS
THAT CUSTOM GOADS TO EVIL WHENCE IN THOSE
THE DWELLERS IN THAT MISERABLE VALE
NATURE IS SO TRANSFORM'D IT SEEMS AS THEY
HAD SHAR'D OF CIRCE'S FEEDING
'MIDST BRUTE SWINE
WORTHIER OF ACORNS THAN OF OTHER FOOD
CREATED FOR MAN'S USE HE SHAPETH FIRST
HIS OBSCURE WAY THEN SLOPING ONWARD FINDS
CURS SNARLERS MORE IN SPITE THAN POWER FROM WHOM
HE TURNS WITH SCORN ASIDE STILL JOURNEYING DOWN
BY HOW MUCH MORE THE CURST AND LUCKLESS FOSS
SWELLS OUT TO LARGENESS E'EN SO MUCH IT FINDS
DOGS TURNING INTO WOLVES
DESCENDING STILL
THROUGH YET MORE HOLLOW EDDIES NEXT HE MEETS
A RACE OF FOXES SO REPLETE WITH CRAFT
THEY DO NOT FEAR THAT SKILL CAN MASTER IT
NOR WILL I CEASE BECAUSE MY WORDS ARE HEARD
BY OTHER EARS THAN THINE
IT SHALL BE WELL
FOR THIS MAN IF HE KEEP IN MEMORY
WHAT FROM NO ERRING SPIRIT I REVEAL
LO BEHOLD THY GRANDSON THAT BECOMES
A HUNTER OF THOSE WOLVES UPON THE SHORE
OF THE FIERCE STREAM AND COWS THEM ALL WITH DREAD
THEIR FLESH YET LIVING SETS HE UP TO SALE
THEN LIKE AN AGED BEAST TO SLAUGHTER DOOMS
MANY OF LIFE HE REAVES HIMSELF OF WORTH
AND GOODLY ESTIMATION
SMEAR'D WITH GORE
MARK HOW HE ISSUES FROM THE RUEFUL WOOD
LEAVING SUCH HAVOC THAT IN THOUSAND YEARS
IT SPREADS NOT TO PRIME LUSTIHOOD AGAIN
AS ONE WHO TIDINGS HEARS OF WOE TO COME
CHANGES HIS LOOKS PERTURB'D FROM WHATE'ER PART
THE PERIL GRASP HIM SO BEHELD I CHANGE
THAT SPIRIT WHO HAD TURN'D TO LISTEN STRUCK
WITH SADNESS SOON AS HE HAD CAUGHT THE WORD
HIS VISAGE AND THE OTHER'S SPEECH DID RAISE
DESIRE IN ME TO KNOW THE NAMES OF BOTH
WHEREOF WITH MEEK ENTREATY I INQUIR'D
THE SHADE WHO LATE ADDREST ME THUS RESUM'D
THY WISH IMPORTS THAT I VOUCHSAFE TO DO
FOR THY SAKE WHAT THOU WILT NOT DO FOR MINE
BUT SINCE GOD'S WILL IS THAT SO LARGELY SHINE
HIS GRACE IN THEE I WILL BE LIBERAL TOO
GUIDO OF DUCA KNOW THEN THAT I AM
ENVY SO PARCH'D MY BLOOD THAT HAD I SEEN
A FELLOW MAN MADE JOYOUS THOU HADST MARK'D
A LIVID PALENESS OVERSPREAD MY CHEEK
SUCH HARVEST REAP I OF THE SEED I SOW'D
O MAN WHY PLACE THY HEART WHERE THERE DOTH NEED
EXCLUSION OF PARTICIPANTS IN GOOD
THIS IS RINIERI'S SPIRIT THIS THE BOAST
AND HONOUR OF THE HOUSE OF CALBOLI
WHERE OF HIS WORTH NO HERITAGE REMAINS
NOR HIS THE ONLY BLOOD THAT HATH BEEN STRIPT
'TWIXT PO THE MOUNT THE RENO AND THE SHORE
OF ALL THAT TRUTH OR FANCY ASKS FOR BLISS
BUT IN THOSE LIMITS SUCH A GROWTH HAS SPRUNG
OF RANK AND VENOM'D ROOTS AS LONG WOULD MOCK
SLOW CULTURE'S TOIL
WHERE IS GOOD LIZIOHERE
MANARDI TRAVERSALO AND CARPIGNA
O BASTARD SLIPS OF OLD ROMAGNA'S LINE
WHEN IN BOLOGNA THE LOW ARTISAN
AND IN FAENZA YON BERNARDIN SPROUTS
A GENTLE CYON FROM IGNOBLE STEM
WONDER NOT TUSCAN IF THOU SEE ME WEEP
WHEN I RECALL TO MIND THOSE ONCE LOV'D NAMES
GUIDO OF PRATA AND OF AZZO HIM
THAT DWELT WITH YOU TIGNOSO AND HIS TROOP
WITH TRAVERSARO'S HOUSE AND ANASTAGIO'S
EACH RACE DISHERITED AND BESIDE THESE
THE LADIES AND THE KNIGHTS THE TOILS AND EASE
THAT WITCH'D US INTO LOVE AND COURTESY
WHERE NOW SUCH MALICE REIGNS IN RECREANT HEARTS
O BRETTINORO WHEREFORE TARRIEST STILL
SINCE FORTH OF THEE THY FAMILY HATH GONE
AND MANY HATING EVIL JOIN'D THEIR STEPS
WELL DOETH HE THAT BIDS HIS LINEAGE CEASE
BAGNACAVALLO CASTRACARO ILL
AND CONIO WORSE WHO CARE TO PROPAGATE
A RACE OF COUNTIES FROM SUCH BLOOD AS THEIRS
WELL SHALL YE ALSO DO PAGANI THEN
WHEN FROM AMONGST YOU TRIES YOUR DEMON CHILD
NOT SO HOWE'ER THAT HENCEFORTH THERE REMAIN
TRUE PROOF OF WHAT YE WERE
O HUGOLIN
THOU SPRUNG OF FANTOLINI'S LINE THY NAME
IS SAFE SINCE NONE IS LOOK'D FOR AFTER THEE
TO CLOUD ITS LUSTRE WARPING FROM THY STOCK
BUT TUSCAN GO THY WAYS FOR NOW I TAKE
FAR MORE DELIGHT IN WEEPING THAN IN WORDS
SUCH PITY FOR YOUR SAKES HATH WRUNG MY HEART
WE KNEW THOSE GENTLE SPIRITS AT PARTING HEARD
OUR STEPS
THEIR SILENCE THEREFORE OF OUR WAY
ASSUR'D US
SOON AS WE HAD QUITTED THEM
ADVANCING ONWARD LO A VOICE THAT SEEM'D
LIKE VOLLIED LIGHT'NING WHEN IT RIVES THE AIR
MET US AND SHOUTED WHOSOEVER FINDS
WILL SLAY ME THEN FLED FROM US AS THE BOLT
LANC'D SUDDEN FROM A DOWNWARD RUSHING CLOUD
WHEN IT HAD GIV'N SHORT TRUCE UNTO OUR HEARING
BEHOLD THE OTHER WITH A CRASH AS LOUD
AS THE QUICK FOLLOWING THUNDER MARK IN ME
AGLAUROS TURN'D TO ROCK I AT THE SOUND
RETREATING DREW MORE CLOSELY TO MY GUIDE
NOW IN MUTE STILLNESS RESTED ALL THE AIR
AND THUS HE SPAKE THERE WAS THE GALLING BIT
BUT YOUR OLD ENEMY SO BAITS HIS HOOK
HE DRAGS YOU EAGER TO HIM
HENCE NOR CURB
AVAILS YOU NOR RECLAIMING CALL
HEAV'N CALLS
AND ROUND ABOUT YOU WHEELING COURTS YOUR GAZE
WITH EVERLASTING BEAUTIES
YET YOUR EYE
TURNS WITH FOND DOTING STILL UPON THE EARTH
THEREFORE HE SMITES YOU WHO DISCERNETH ALL
CANTO XV
AS MUCH AS 'TWIXT THE THIRD HOUR'S CLOSE AND DAWN
APPEARETH OF HEAV'N'S SPHERE THAT EVER WHIRLS
AS RESTLESS AS AN INFANT IN HIS PLAY
SO MUCH APPEAR'D REMAINING TO THE SUN
OF HIS SLOPE JOURNEY TOWARDS THE WESTERN GOAL
EVENING WAS THERE AND HERE THE NOON OF NIGHT
AND FULL UPON OUR FOREHEAD SMOTE THE BEAMS
FOR ROUND THE MOUNTAIN CIRCLING SO OUR PATH
HAD LED US THAT TOWARD THE SUN SET NOW
DIRECT WE JOURNEY'D WHEN I FELT A WEIGHT
OF MORE EXCEEDING SPLENDOUR THAN BEFORE
PRESS ON MY FRONT
THE CAUSE UNKNOWN AMAZE
POSSESS'D ME AND BOTH HANDS AGAINST MY BROW
LIFTING I INTERPOS'D THEM AS A SCREEN
THAT OF ITS GORGEOUS SUPERFLUX OF LIGHT
CLIPP'D THE DIMINISH'D ORB
AS WHEN THE RAY
STRIKING ON WATER OR THE SURFACE CLEAR
OF MIRROR LEAPS UNTO THE OPPOSITE PART
ASCENDING AT A GLANCE E'EN AS IT FELL
AND SO MUCH DIFFERS FROM THE STONE THAT FALLS
THROUGH EQUAL SPACE AS PRACTICE SKILL HATH SHOWN
THUS WITH REFRACTED LIGHT BEFORE ME SEEMED
THE GROUND THERE SMITTEN WHENCE IN SUDDEN HASTE
MY SIGHT RECOIL'D
WHAT IS THIS SIRE BELOV'D
'GAINST WHICH I STRIVE TO SHIELD THE SIGHT IN VAIN
CRIED I AND WHICH TOWARDS US MOVING SEEMS
MARVEL NOT IF THE FAMILY OF HEAV'N
HE ANSWER'D YET WITH DAZZLING RADIANCE DIM
THY SENSE IT IS A MESSENGER WHO COMES
INVITING MAN'S ASCENT
SUCH SIGHTS ERE LONG
NOT GRIEVOUS SHALL IMPART TO THEE DELIGHT
AS THY PERCEPTION IS BY NATURE WROUGHT
UP TO THEIR PITCH THE BLESSED ANGEL SOON
AS WE HAD REACH'D HIM HAIL'D US WITH GLAD VOICE
HERE ENTER ON A LADDER FAR LESS STEEP
THAN YE HAVE YET ENCOUNTER'D WE FORTHWITH
ASCENDING HEARD BEHIND US CHANTED SWEET
BLESSED THE MERCIFUL AND HAPPY THOU
THAT CONQUER'ST LONELY EACH MY GUIDE AND I
PURSUED OUR UPWARD WAY AND AS WE WENT
SOME PROFIT FROM HIS WORDS I HOP'D TO WIN
AND THUS OF HIM INQUIRING FRAM'D MY SPEECH
WHAT MEANT ROMAGNA'S SPIRIT WHEN HE SPAKE
OF BLISS EXCLUSIVE WITH NO PARTNER SHAR'D
HE STRAIGHT REPLIED NO WONDER SINCE HE KNOWS
WHAT SORROW WAITS ON HIS OWN WORST DEFECT
IF HE CHIDE OTHERS THAT THEY LESS MAY MOURN
BECAUSE YE POINT YOUR WISHES AT A MARK
WHERE BY COMMUNION OF POSSESSORS PART
IS LESSEN'D ENVY BLOWETH UP THE SIGHS OF MEN
NO FEAR OF THAT MIGHT TOUCH YE IF THE LOVE
OF HIGHER SPHERE EXALTED YOUR DESIRE
FOR THERE BY HOW MUCH MORE THEY CALL IT OURS
SO MUCH PROPRIETY OF EACH IN GOOD
INCREASES MORE AND HEIGHTEN'D CHARITY
WRAPS THAT FAIR CLOISTER IN A BRIGHTER FLAME
NOW LACK I SATISFACTION MORE SAID I
THAN IF THOU HADST BEEN SILENT AT THE FIRST
AND DOUBT MORE GATHERS ON MY LAB'RING THOUGHT
HOW CAN IT CHANCE THAT GOOD DISTRIBUTED
THE MANY THAT POSSESS IT MAKES MORE RICH
THAN IF 'T WERE SHAR'D BY FEW HE ANSWERING THUS
THY MIND REVERTING STILL TO THINGS OF EARTH
STRIKES DARKNESS FROM TRUE LIGHT
THE HIGHEST GOOD
UNLIMITED INEFFABLE DOTH SO SPEED
TO LOVE AS BEAM TO LUCID BODY DARTS
GIVING AS MUCH OF ARDOUR AS IT FINDS
THE SEMPITERNAL EFFLUENCE STREAMS ABROAD
SPREADING WHEREVER CHARITY EXTENDS
SO THAT THE MORE ASPIRANTS TO THAT BLISS
ARE MULTIPLIED MORE GOOD IS THERE TO LOVE
AND MORE IS LOV'D AS MIRRORS THAT REFLECT
EACH UNTO OTHER PROPAGATED LIGHT
IF THESE MY WORDS AVAIL NOT TO ALLAY
THY THIRSTING BEATRICE THOU SHALT SEE
WHO OF THIS WANT AND OF ALL ELSE THOU HAST
SHALL RID THEE TO THE FULL
PROVIDE BUT THOU
THAT FROM THY TEMPLES MAY BE SOON ERAS'D
E'EN AS THE TWO ALREADY THOSE FIVE SCARS
THAT WHEN THEY PAIN THEE WORST THEN KINDLIEST HEAL
THOU I HAD SAID CONTENT'ST ME WHEN I SAW
THE OTHER ROUND WAS GAIN'D AND WOND'RING EYES
DID KEEP ME MUTE
THERE SUDDENLY I SEEM'D
BY AN ECSTATIC VISION WRAPT AWAY
AND IN A TEMPLE SAW METHOUGHT A CROWD
OF MANY PERSONS AND AT TH' ENTRANCE STOOD
A DAME WHOSE SWEET DEMEANOUR DID EXPRESS
A MOTHER'S LOVE WHO SAID CHILD WHY HAST THOU
DEALT WITH US THUS BEHOLD THY SIRE AND I
SORROWING HAVE SOUGHT THEE AND SO HELD HER PEACE
AND STRAIGHT THE VISION FLED
A FEMALE NEXT
APPEAR'D BEFORE ME DOWN WHOSE VISAGE COURS'D
THOSE WATERS THAT GRIEF FORCES OUT FROM ONE
BY DEEP RESENTMENT STUNG WHO SEEM'D TO SAY
IF THOU PISISTRATUS BE LORD INDEED
OVER THIS CITY NAM'D WITH SUCH DEBATE
OF ADVERSE GODS AND WHENCE EACH SCIENCE SPARKLES
AVENGE THEE OF THOSE ARMS WHOSE BOLD EMBRACE
HATH CLASP'D OUR DAUGHTER AND TO FUEL MESEEM'D
BENIGN AND MEEK WITH VISAGE UNDISTURB'D
HER SOVRAN SPAKE HOW SHALL WE THOSE REQUITE
WHO WISH US EVIL IF WE THUS CONDEMN
THE MAN THAT LOVES US AFTER THAT I SAW
A MULTITUDE IN FURY BURNING SLAY
WITH STONES A STRIPLING YOUTH AND SHOUT AMAIN
DESTROY DESTROY AND HIM I SAW WHO BOW'D
HEAVY WITH DEATH UNTO THE GROUND YET MADE
HIS EYES UNFOLDED UPWARD GATES TO HEAV'N
PRAYING FORGIVENESS OF TH' ALMIGHTY SIRE
AMIDST THAT CRUEL CONFLICT ON HIS FOES
WITH LOOKS THAT WITH COMPASSION TO THEIR AIM
SOON AS MY SPIRIT FROM HER AIRY FLIGHT
RETURNING SOUGHT AGAIN THE THINGS WHOSE TRUTH
DEPENDS NOT ON HER SHAPING I OBSERV'D
HOW SHE HAD ROV'D TO NO UNREAL SCENES
MEANWHILE THE LEADER WHO MIGHT SEE I MOV'D
AS ONE WHO STRUGGLES TO SHAKE OFF HIS SLEEP
EXCLAIM'D WHAT AILS THEE THAT THOU CANST NOT HOLD
THY FOOTING FIRM BUT MORE THAN HALF A LEAGUE
HAST TRAVEL'D WITH CLOS'D EYES AND TOTT'RING GAIT
LIKE TO A MAN BY WINE OR SLEEP O'ERCHARG'D
BELOVED FATHER SO THOU DEIGN SAID I
TO LISTEN I WILL TELL THEE WHAT APPEAR'D
BEFORE ME WHEN SO FAIL'D MY SINKING STEPS
HE THUS NOT IF THY COUNTENANCE WERE MASK'D
WITH HUNDRED VIZARDS COULD A THOUGHT OF THINE
HOW SMALL SOE'ER ELUDE ME
WHAT THOU SAW'ST
WAS SHOWN THAT FREELY THOU MIGHTST OPE THY HEART
TO THE WATERS OF PEACE THAT FLOW DIFFUS'D
FROM THEIR ETERNAL FOUNTAIN
I NOT ASK'D
WHAT AILS THEEOR SUCH CAUSE AS HE DOTH WHO
LOOKS ONLY WITH THAT EYE WHICH SEES NO MORE
WHEN SPIRITLESS THE BODY LIES BUT ASK'D
TO GIVE FRESH VIGOUR TO THY FOOT
SUCH GOADS
THE SLOW AND LOIT'RING NEED THAT THEY BE FOUND
NOT WANTING WHEN THEIR HOUR OF WATCH RETURNS
SO ON WE JOURNEY'D THROUGH THE EVENING SKY
GAZING INTENT FAR ONWARD AS OUR EYES
WITH LEVEL VIEW COULD STRETCH AGAINST THE BRIGHT
VESPERTINE RAY AND LO BY SLOW DEGREES
GATH'RING A FOG MADE TOW'RDS US DARK AS NIGHT
THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR 'SCAPING AND THAT MIST
BEREFT US BOTH OF SIGHT AND THE PURE AIR
CANTO XVI
HELL'S DUNNEST GLOOM OR NIGHT UNLUSTROUS DARK
OF EVERY PLANES 'REFT AND PALL'D IN CLOUDS
DID NEVER SPREAD BEFORE THE SIGHT A VEIL
IN THICKNESS LIKE THAT FOG NOR TO THE SENSE
SO PALPABLE AND GROSS
ENT'RING ITS SHADE
MINE EYE ENDURED NOT WITH UNCLOSED LIDS
WHICH MARKING NEAR ME DREW THE FAITHFUL GUIDE
OFFERING ME HIS SHOULDER FOR A STAY
AS THE BLIND MAN BEHIND HIS LEADER WALKS
LEST HE SHOULD ERR OR STUMBLE UNAWARES
ON WHAT MIGHT HARM HIM OR PERHAPS DESTROY
I JOURNEY'D THROUGH THAT BITTER AIR AND FOUL
STILL LIST'NING TO MY ESCORT'S WARNING VOICE
LOOK THAT FROM ME THOU PART NOT STRAIGHT I HEARD
VOICES AND EACH ONE SEEM'D TO PRAY FOR PEACE
AND FOR COMPASSION TO THE LAMB OF GOD
THAT TAKETH SINS AWAY
THEIR PRELUDE STILL
WAS AGNUS DEI AND THROUGH ALL THE CHOIR
ONE VOICE ONE MEASURE RAN THAT PERFECT SEEM'D
THE CONCORD OF THEIR SONG
ARE THESE I HEAR
SPIRITS O MASTER I EXCLAIM'D AND HE
THOU AIM'ST ARIGHT THESE LOOSE THE BONDS OF WRATH
NOW WHO ART THOU THAT THROUGH OUR SMOKE DOST CLEAVE
AND SPEAK'ST OF US AS THOU THYSELF E'EN YET
DIVIDEST TIME BY CALENDS SO ONE VOICE
BESPAKE ME WHENCE MY MASTER SAID REPLY
AND ASK IF UPWARD HENCE THE PASSAGE LEAD
O BEING WHO DOST MAKE THEE PURE TO STAND
BEAUTIFUL ONCE MORE IN THY MAKER'S SIGHT
ALONG WITH ME AND THOU SHALT HEAR AND WONDER
THUS I WHERETO THE SPIRIT ANSWERING SPAKE
LONG AS 'T IS LAWFUL FOR ME SHALL MY STEPS
FOLLOW ON THINE AND SINCE THE CLOUDY SMOKE
FORBIDS THE SEEING HEARING IN ITS STEAD
SHALL KEEP US JOIN'D I THEN FORTHWITH BEGAN
YET IN MY MORTAL SWATHING I ASCEND
TO HIGHER REGIONS AND AM HITHER COME
THROUGH THE FEARFUL AGONY OF HELL
AND IF SO LARGELY GOD HATH DOLED HIS GRACE
THAT CLEAN BESIDE ALL MODERN PRECEDENT
HE WILLS ME TO BEHOLD HIS KINGLY STATE
FROM ME CONCEAL NOT WHO THOU WAST ERE DEATH
HAD LOOS'D THEE BUT INSTRUCT ME AND INSTRUCT
IF RIGHTLY TO THE PASS I TEND THY WORDS
THE WAY DIRECTING AS A SAFE ESCORT
I WAS OF LOMBARDY AND MARCO CALL'D
NOT INEXPERIENC'D OF THE WORLD THAT WORTH
I STILL AFFECTED FROM WHICH ALL HAVE TURN'D
THE NERVELESS BOW ASIDE
THY COURSE TENDS RIGHT
UNTO THE SUMMIT AND REPLYING THUS
HE ADDED I BESEECH THEE PRAY FOR ME
WHEN THOU SHALT COME ALOFT AND I TO HIM
ACCEPT MY FAITH FOR PLEDGE I WILL PERFORM
WHAT THOU REQUIREST
YET ONE DOUBT REMAINS
THAT WRINGS ME SORELY IF I SOLVE IT NOT
SINGLY BEFORE IT URG'D ME DOUBLED NOW
BY THINE OPINION WHEN I COUPLE THAT
WITH ONE ELSEWHERE DECLAR'D EACH STRENGTH'NING OTHER
THE WORLD INDEED IS EVEN SO FORLORN
OF ALL GOOD AS THOU SPEAK'ST IT AND SO SWARMS
WITH EVERY EVIL
YET BESEECH THEE POINT
THE CAUSE OUT TO ME THAT MYSELF MAY SEE
AND UNTO OTHERS SHOW IT FOR IN HEAVEN
ONE PLACES IT AND ONE ON EARTH BELOW
THEN HEAVING FORTH A DEEP AND AUDIBLE SIGH
BROTHER HE THUS BEGAN THE WORLD IS BLIND
AND THOU IN TRUTH COM'ST FROM IT
YE WHO LIVE
DO SO EACH CAUSE REFER TO HEAV'N ABOVE
E'EN AS ITS MOTION OF NECESSITY
DREW WITH IT ALL THAT MOVES
IF THIS WERE SO
FREE CHOICE IN YOU WERE NONE NOR JUSTICE WOULD
THERE SHOULD BE JOY FOR VIRTUE WOE FOR ILL
YOUR MOVEMENTS HAVE THEIR PRIMAL BENT FROM HEAVEN
NOT ALL YET SAID I ALL WHAT THEN ENSUES
LIGHT HAVE YE STILL TO FOLLOW EVIL OR GOOD
AND OF THE WILL FREE POWER WHICH IF IT STAND
FIRM AND UNWEARIED IN HEAV'N'S FIRST ASSAY
CONQUERS AT LAST SO IT BE CHERISH'D WELL
TRIUMPHANT OVER ALL
TO MIGHTIER FORCE
TO BETTER NATURE SUBJECT YE ABIDE
FREE NOT CONSTRAIN'D BY THAT WHICH FORMS IN YOU
THE REASONING MIND UNINFLUENC'D OF THE STARS
IF THEN THE PRESENT RACE OF MANKIND ERR
SEEK IN YOURSELVES THE CAUSE AND FIND IT THERE
HEREIN THOU SHALT CONFESS ME NO FALSE SPY
FORTH FROM HIS PLASTIC HAND WHO CHARM'D BEHOLDS
HER IMAGE ERE SHE YET EXIST THE SOUL
COMES LIKE A BABE THAT WANTONS SPORTIVELY
WEEPING AND LAUGHING IN ITS WAYWARD MOODS
AS ARTLESS AND AS IGNORANT OF AUGHT
SAVE THAT HER MAKER BEING ONE WHO DWELLS
WITH GLADNESS EVER WILLINGLY SHE TURNS
TO WHATE'ER YIELDS HER JOY
OF SOME SLIGHT GOOD
THE FLAVOUR SOON SHE TASTES AND SNAR'D BY THAT
WITH FONDNESS SHE PURSUES IT IF NO GUIDE
RECALL NO REIN DIRECT HER WAND'RING COURSE
HENCE IT BEHOV'D THE LAW SHOULD BE A CURB
A SOVEREIGN HENCE BEHOV'D WHOSE PIERCING VIEW
MIGHT MARK AT LEAST THE FORTRESS AND MAIN TOWER
OF THE TRUE CITY
LAWS INDEED THERE ARE
BUT WHO IS HE OBSERVES THEM NONE NOT HE
WHO GOES BEFORE THE SHEPHERD OF THE FLOCK
WHO CHEWS THE CUD BUT DOTH NOT CLEAVE THE HOOF
THEREFORE THE MULTITUDE WHO SEE THEIR GUIDE
STRIKE AT THE VERY GOOD THEY COVET MOST
FEED THERE AND LOOK NO FURTHER
THUS THE CAUSE
IS NOT CORRUPTED NATURE IN YOURSELVES
BUT ILL CONDUCTING THAT HATH TURN'D THE WORLD
TO EVIL
ROME THAT TURN'D IT UNTO GOOD
WAS WONT TO BOAST TWO SUNS WHOSE SEVERAL BEAMS
CAST LIGHT ON EITHER WAY THE WORLD'S AND GOD'S
ONE SINCE HATH QUENCH'D THE OTHER AND THE SWORD
IS GRAFTED ON THE CROOK AND SO CONJOIN'D
EACH MUST PERFORCE DECLINE TO WORSE UNAW'D
BY FEAR OF OTHER
IF THOU DOUBT ME MARK
THE BLADE EACH HERB IS JUDG'D OF BY ITS SEED
THAT LAND THROUGH WHICH ADICE AND THE PO
THEIR WATERS ROLL WAS ONCE THE RESIDENCE
OF COURTESY AND VELOUR ERE THE DAY
THAT FROWN'D ON FREDERICK NOW SECURE MAY PASS
THOSE LIMITS WHOSOE'ER HATH LEFT FOR SHAME
TO TALK WITH GOOD MEN OR COME NEAR THEIR HAUNTS
THREE AGED ONES ARE STILL FOUND THERE IN WHOM
THE OLD TIME CHIDES THE NEW THESE DEEM IT LONG
ERE GOD RESTORE THEM TO A BETTER WORLD
THE GOOD GHERARDO OF PALAZZO HE
CONRAD AND GUIDO OF CASTELLO NAM'D
IN GALLIC PHRASE MORE FITLY THE PLAIN LOMBARD
ON THIS AT LAST CONCLUDE
THE CHURCH OF ROME
MIXING TWO GOVERNMENTS THAT ILL ASSORT
HATH MISS'D HER FOOTING FALL'N INTO THE MIRE
AND THERE HERSELF AND BURDEN MUCH DEFIL'D
O MARCO I REPLIED SHINE ARGUMENTS
CONVINCE ME AND THE CAUSE I NOW DISCERN
WHY OF THE HERITAGE NO PORTION CAME
TO LEVI'S OFFSPRING
BUT RESOLVE ME THIS
WHO THAT GHERARDO IS THAT AS THOU SAYST
IS LEFT A SAMPLE OF THE PERISH'D RACE
AND FOR REBUKE TO THIS UNTOWARD AGE
EITHER THY WORDS SAID HE DECEIVE OR ELSE
ARE MEANT TO TRY ME THAT THOU SPEAKING TUSCAN
APPEAR'ST NOT TO HAVE HEARD OF GOOD GHERADO
THE SOLE ADDITION THAT BY WHICH I KNOW HIM
UNLESS I BORROW'D FROM HIS DAUGHTER GAIA
ANOTHER NAME TO GRACE HIM
GOD BE WITH YOU
I BEAR YOU COMPANY NO MORE
BEHOLD
THE DAWN WITH WHITE RAY GLIMM'RING THROUGH THE MIST
I MUST AWAY THE ANGEL COMES ERE HE
APPEAR HE SAID AND WOULD NOT HEAR ME MORE
CANTO XVII

KINDLED IN HEAV'N SPONTANEOUS SELF INFORM'D
OR LIKELIER GLIDING DOWN WITH SWIFT ILLAPSE
BY WILL DIVINE
PORTRAY'D BEFORE ME CAME
THE TRACES OF HER DIRE IMPIETY
WHOSE FORM WAS CHANG'D INTO THE BIRD THAT MOST
DELIGHTS ITSELF IN SONG AND HERE MY MIND
WAS INWARDLY SO WRAPT IT GAVE NO PLACE
TO AUGHT THAT ASK'D ADMITTANCE FROM WITHOUT
NEXT SHOWER'D INTO MY FANTASY A SHAPE
AS OF ONE CRUCIFIED WHOSE VISAGE SPAKE

NOW HAST THOU LOST ME
I AM SHE WHOSE TEARS
MOURN ERE I FALL A MOTHER'S TIMELESS END
E'EN AS A SLEEP BREAKS OFF IF SUDDENLY
NEW RADIANCE STRIKE UPON THE CLOSED LIDS
THE BROKEN SLUMBER QUIVERING ERE IT DIES
THUS FROM BEFORE ME SUNK THAT IMAGERY
VANISHING SOON AS ON MY FACE THERE STRUCK
THE LIGHT OUTSHINING FAR OUR EARTHLY BEAM
AS ROUND I TURN'D ME TO SURVEY WHAT PLACE
I HAD ARRIV'D AT HERE YE MOUNT EXCLAIM'D
A VOICE THAT OTHER PURPOSE LEFT ME NONE
SAVE WILL SO EAGER TO BEHOLD WHO SPAKE
I COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT GAZE
AS 'FORE THE SUN
THAT WEIGHS OUR VISION DOWN AND VEILS HIS FORM
IN LIGHT TRANSCENDENT THUS MY VIRTUE FAIL'D
UNEQUAL
THIS IS SPIRIT FROM ABOVE
WHO MARSHALS US OUR UPWARD WAY UNSOUGHT
AND IN HIS OWN LIGHT SHROUDS HIM
AS A MAN
DOTH FOR HIMSELF SO NOW IS DONE FOR US
FOR WHOSO WAITS IMPLORING YET SEES NEED
OF HIS PROMPT AIDANCE SETS HIMSELF PREPAR'D
FOR BLUNT DENIAL ERE THE SUIT BE MADE
REFUSE WE NOT TO LEND A READY FOOT
AT SUCH INVITING HASTE WE TO ASCEND
BEFORE IT DARKEN FOR WE MAY NOT THEN
TILL MORN AGAIN RETURN SO SPAKE MY GUIDE
AND TO ONE LADDER BOTH ADDRESS'D OUR STEPS
AND THE FIRST STAIR APPROACHING I PERCEIV'D
NEAR ME AS 'TWERE THE WAVING OF A WING
THAT FANN'D MY FACE AND WHISPER'D BLESSED THEY
THE PEACEMAKERS THEY KNOW NOT EVIL WRATH
NOW TO SUCH HEIGHT ABOVE OUR HEADS WERE RAIS'D
THE LAST BEAMS FOLLOW'D CLOSE BY HOODED NIGHT
THAT MANY A STAR ON ALL SIDES THROUGH THE GLOOM
SHONE OUT
WHY PARTEST FROM ME O MY STRENGTH
SO WITH MYSELF I COMMUN'D FOR I FELT
MY O'ERTOIL'D SINEWS SLACKEN
WE HAD REACH'D
THE SUMMIT AND WERE FIX'D LIKE TO A BARK
ARRIV'D AT LAND
AND WAITING A SHORT SPACE
IF AUGHT SHOULD MEET MINE EAR IN THAT NEW ROUND
THEN TO MY GUIDE I TURN'D AND SAID LOV'D SIRE
DECLARE WHAT GUILT IS ON THIS CIRCLE PURG'D
IF OUR FEET REST NO NEED THY SPEECH SHOULD PAUSE
HE THUS TO ME THE LOVE OF GOOD WHATE'ER
WANTED OF JUST PROPORTION HERE FULFILS
HERE PLIES AFRESH THE OAR THAT LOITER'D ILL
BUT THAT THOU MAYST YET CLEARLIER UNDERSTAND
GIVE EAR UNTO MY WORDS AND THOU SHALT CULL
SOME FRUIT MAY PLEASE THEE WELL FROM THIS DELAY
CREATOR NOR CREATED BEING NE'ER
MY SON HE THUS BEGAN WAS WITHOUT LOVE
OR NATURAL OR THE FREE SPIRIT'S GROWTH
THOU HAST NOT THAT TO LEARN
THE NATURAL STILL
IS WITHOUT ERROR BUT THE OTHER SWERVES
IF ON ILL OBJECT BENT OR THROUGH EXCESS
OF VIGOUR OR DEFECT
WHILE E'ER IT SEEKS
THE PRIMAL BLESSINGS OR WITH MEASURE DUE
TH' INFERIOR NO DELIGHT THAT FLOWS FROM IT
PARTAKES OF ILL
BUT LET IT WARP TO EVIL
OR WITH MORE ARDOUR THAN BEHOOVES OR LESS
PURSUE THE GOOD THE THING CREATED THEN
WORKS 'GAINST ITS MAKER
HENCE THOU MUST INFER
THAT LOVE IS GERMIN OF EACH VIRTUE IN YE
AND OF EACH ACT NO LESS THAT MERITS PAIN
NOW SINCE IT MAY NOT BE BUT LOVE INTEND
THE WELFARE MAINLY OF THE THING IT LOVES
ALL FROM SELF HATRED ARE SECURE AND SINCE
NO BEING CAN BE THOUGHT T' EXIST APART
AND INDEPENDENT OF THE FIRST A BAR
OF EQUAL FORCE RESTRAINS FROM HATING THAT
GRANT THE DISTINCTION JUST AND IT REMAINS
THE' EVIL MUST BE ANOTHER'S WHICH IS LOV'D
THREE WAYS SUCH LOVE IS GENDER'D IN YOUR CLAY
THERE IS WHO HOPES HIS NEIGHBOUR'S WORTH DEPREST
PREEMINENCE HIMSELF AND COVERTS HENCE
FOR HIS OWN GREATNESS THAT ANOTHER FALL
THERE IS WHO SO MUCH FEARS THE LOSS OF POWER
FAME FAVOUR GLORY SHOULD HIS FELLOW MOUNT
ABOVE HIM AND SO SICKENS AT THE THOUGHT
HE LOVES THEIR OPPOSITE AND THERE IS HE
WHOM WRONG OR INSULT SEEMS TO GALL AND SHAME
THAT HE DOTH THIRST FOR VENGEANCE AND SUCH NEEDS
MUST DOAT ON OTHER'S EVIL
HERE BENEATH
THIS THREEFOLD LOVE IS MOURN'D
OF TH' OTHER SORT
BE NOW INSTRUCTED THAT WHICH FOLLOWS GOOD
BUT WITH DISORDER'D AND IRREGULAR COURSE
ALL INDISTINCTLY APPREHEND A BLISS
ON WHICH THE SOUL MAY REST THE HEARTS OF ALL
YEARN AFTER IT AND TO THAT WISHED BOURN
ALL THEREFORE STRIVE TO TEND
IF YE BEHOLD
OR SEEK IT WITH A LOVE REMISS AND LAX
THIS CORNICE AFTER JUST REPENTING LAYS
ITS PENAL TORMENT ON YE
OTHER GOOD
THERE IS WHERE MAN FINDS NOT HIS HAPPINESS
IT IS NOT TRUE FRUITION NOT THAT BLEST
ESSENCE OF EVERY GOOD THE BRANCH AND ROOT
THE LOVE TOO LAVISHLY BESTOW'D ON THIS
ALONG THREE CIRCLES OVER US IS MOURN'D
ACCOUNT OF THAT DIVISION TRIPARTITE
EXPECT NOT FITTER FOR THINE OWN RESEARCH
CANTO XVIII
THE TEACHER ENDED AND HIS HIGH DISCOURSE
CONCLUDING EARNEST IN MY LOOKS INQUIR'D
IF I APPEAR'D CONTENT AND I WHOM STILL
UNSATED THIRST TO HEAR HIM URG'D WAS MUTE
MUTE OUTWARDLY YET INWARDLY I SAID
PERCHANCE MY TOO MUCH QUESTIONING OFFENDS
BUT HE TRUE FATHER MARK'D THE SECRET WISH
BY DIFFIDENCE RESTRAIN'D AND SPEAKING GAVE
ME BOLDNESS THUS TO SPEAK 'MASTER MY SIGHT
GATHERS SO LIVELY VIRTUE FROM THY BEAMS
THAT ALL THY WORDS CONVEY DISTINCT IS SEEN
WHEREFORE I PRAY THEE FATHER WHOM THIS HEART
HOLDS DEAREST THOU WOULDST DEIGN BY PROOF T' UNFOLD
THAT LOVE FROM WHICH AS FROM THEIR SOURCE THOU BRING'ST
ALL GOOD DEEDS AND THEIR OPPOSITE HE THEN
TO WHAT I NOW DISCLOSE BE THY CLEAR KEN
DIRECTED AND THOU PLAINLY SHALT BEHOLD
HOW MUCH THOSE BLIND HAVE ERR'D WHO MAKE THEMSELVES
THE GUIDES OF MEN
THE SOUL CREATED APT
TO LOVE MOVES VERSATILE WHICH WAY SOE'ER
AUGHT PLEASING PROMPTS HER SOON AS SHE IS WAK'D
BY PLEASURE INTO ACT
OF SUBSTANCE TRUE
YOUR APPREHENSION FORMS ITS COUNTERFEIT
AND IN YOU THE IDEAL SHAPE PRESENTING
ATTRACTS THE SOUL'S REGARD
IF SHE THUS DRAWN
INCLINE TOWARD IT LOVE IS THAT INCLINING
AND A NEW NATURE KNIT BY PLEASURE IN YE
THEN AS THE FIRE POINTS UP AND MOUNTING SEEKS
HIS BIRTH PLACE AND HIS LASTING SEAT E'EN THUS
ENTERS THE CAPTIVE SOUL INTO DESIRE
WHICH IS A SPIRITUAL MOTION THAT NE'ER RESTS
BEFORE ENJOYMENT OF THE THING IT LOVES
ENOUGH TO SHOW THEE HOW THE TRUTH FROM THOSE
IS HIDDEN WHO AVER ALL LOVE A THING
PRAISE WORTHY IN ITSELF ALTHOUGH PERHAPS
ITS SUBSTANCE SEEM STILL GOOD
YET IF THE WAX
BE GOOD IT FOLLOWS NOT TH' IMPRESSION MUST
WHAT LOVE IS I RETURN'D THY WORDS O GUIDE
AND MY OWN DOCILE MIND REVEAL
YET THENCE
NEW DOUBTS HAVE SPRUNG
FOR FROM WITHOUT IF LOVE
BE OFFER'D TO US AND THE SPIRIT KNOWS
NO OTHER FOOTING TEND SHE RIGHT OR WRONG
IS NO DESERT OF HERS HE ANSWERING THUS
WHAT REASON HERE DISCOVERS I HAVE POWER
TO SHOW THEE THAT WHICH LIES BEYOND EXPECT
FROM BEATRICE FAITH NOT REASON'S TASK
SPIRIT SUBSTANTIAL FORM WITH MATTER JOIN'D
NOT IN CONFUSION MIX'D HATH IN ITSELF
SPECIFIC VIRTUE OF THAT UNION BORN
WHICH IS NOT FELT EXCEPT IT WORK NOR PROV'D
BUT THROUGH EFFECT AS VEGETABLE LIFE
BY THE GREEN LEAF
FROM WHENCE HIS INTELLECT
DEDUCED ITS PRIMAL NOTICES OF THINGS
MAN THEREFORE KNOWS NOT OR HIS APPETITES
THEIR FIRST AFFECTIONS SUCH IN YOU AS ZEAL
IN BEES TO GATHER HONEY AT THE FIRST
VOLITION MERITING NOR BLAME NOR PRAISE
BUT O'ER EACH LOWER FACULTY SUPREME
THAT AS SHE LIST ARE SUMMON'D TO HER BAR
YE HAVE THAT VIRTUE IN YOU WHOSE JUST VOICE
UTTERETH COUNSEL AND WHOSE WORD SHOULD KEEP
THE THRESHOLD OF ASSENT
HERE IS THE SOURCE
WHENCE CAUSE OF MERIT IN YOU IS DERIV'D
E'EN AS THE AFFECTIONS GOOD OR ILL SHE TAKES
OR SEVERS WINNOW'D AS THE CHAFF
THOSE MEN
WHO REAS'NING WENT TO DEPTH PROFOUNDEST MARK'D
THAT INNATE FREEDOM AND WERE THENCE INDUC'D
TO LEAVE THEIR MORAL TEACHING TO THE WORLD
GRANT THEN THAT FROM NECESSITY ARISE
ALL LOVE THAT GLOWS WITHIN YOU TO DISMISS
OR HARBOUR IT THE POW'R IS IN YOURSELVES
REMEMBER BEATRICE IN HER STYLE
DENOMINATES FREE CHOICE BY EMINENCE
THE NOBLE VIRTUE IF IN TALK WITH THEE
SHE TOUCH UPON THAT THEME THE MOON WELL NIGH
TO MIDNIGHT HOUR BELATED MADE THE STARS
APPEAR TO WINK AND FADE AND HER BROAD DISK
SEEM'D LIKE A CRAG ON FIRE AS UP THE VAULT
THAT COURSE SHE JOURNEY'D WHICH THE SUN THEN WARMS
WHEN THEY OF ROME BEHOLD HIM AT HIS SET
BETWIXT SARDINIA AND THE CORSIC ISLE
AND NOW THE WEIGHT THAT HUNG UPON MY THOUGHT
WAS LIGHTEN'D BY THE AID OF THAT CLEAR SPIRIT
WHO RAISETH ANDES ABOVE MANTUA'S NAME
I THEREFORE WHEN MY QUESTIONS HAD OBTAIN'D
SOLUTION PLAIN AND AMPLE STOOD AS ONE
MUSING IN DREARY SLUMBER BUT NOT LONG
SLUMBER'D FOR SUDDENLY A MULTITUDE
THE STEEP ALREADY TURNING FROM BEHIND
RUSH'D ON
WITH FURY AND LIKE RANDOM ROUT

DISCOURTEOUS RUDENESS
IN VERONA I
WAS ABBOT OF SAN ZENO WHEN THE HAND

THAT NAME NE'ER UTTER'D WITHOUT TEARS IN MILAN
AND THERE IS HE HATH ONE FOOT IN HIS GRAVE
WHO FOR THAT MONASTERY ERE LONG SHALL WEEP
RUING HIS POWER MISUS'D FOR THAT HIS SON
OF BODY ILL COMPACT AND WORSE IN MIND
AND BORN IN EVIL HE HATH SET IN PLACE
OF ITS TRUE PASTOR WHETHER MORE HE SPAKE
OR HERE WAS MUTE I KNOW NOT HE HAD SPED

HE THEN WHO NEVER FAIL'D ME AT MY NEED
CRIED HITHER TURN
LO TWO WITH SHARP REMORSE
CHIDING THEIR SIN IN REAR OF ALL THE TROOP
THESE SHOUTED FIRST THEY DIED TO WHOM THE SEA

LIFE WITHOUT GLORY SOON AS THEY HAD FLED
PAST REACH OF SIGHT NEW THOUGHT WITHIN ME ROSE
BY OTHERS FOLLOW'D FAST AND EACH UNLIKE
ITS FELLOW TILL LED ON FROM THOUGHT TO THOUGHT

WAS CLOS'D AND MEDITATION CHANG'D TO DREAM
CANTO XIX
IT WAS THE HOUR WHEN OF DIURNAL HEAT
NO RELIQUES CHAFE THE COLD BEAMS OF THE MOON
O'ERPOWER'D BY EARTH OR PLANETARY SWAY
OF SATURN AND THE GEOMANCER SEES
HIS GREATER FORTUNE UP THE EAST ASCEND
WHERE GRAY DAWN CHECKERS FIRST THE SHADOWY CONE
WHEN 'FORE ME IN MY DREAM A WOMAN'S SHAPE
THERE CAME WITH LIPS THAT STAMMER'D EYES ASLANT
DISTORTED FEET HANDS MAIM'D AND COLOUR PALE
I LOOK'D UPON HER AND AS SUNSHINE CHEERS
LIMBS NUMB'D BY NIGHTLY COLD E'EN THUS MY LOOK
UNLOOS'D HER TONGUE NEXT IN BRIEF SPACE HER FORM
DECREPIT RAIS'D ERECT AND FADED FACE
WITH LOVE'S OWN HUE ILLUM'D
RECOV'RING SPEECH
SHE FORTHWITH WARBLING SUCH A STRAIN BEGAN
THAT I HOW LOTH SOE'ER COULD SCARCE HAVE HELD
ATTENTION FROM THE SONG
I THUS SHE SANG
I AM THE SIREN SHE WHOM MARINERS
ON THE WIDE SEA ARE WILDER'D WHEN THEY HEAR
SUCH FULNESS OF DELIGHT THE LIST'NER FEELS
I FROM HIS COURSE ULYSSES BY MY LAY
ENCHANTED DREW
WHOE'ER FREQUENTS ME ONCE
PARTS SELDOM SO I CHARM HIM AND HIS HEART
CONTENTED KNOWS NO VOID OR ERE HER MOUTH
WAS CLOS'D TO SHAME HER AT HER SIDE APPEAR'D
A DAME OF SEMBLANCE HOLY
WITH STERN VOICE
SHE UTTER'D SAY O VIRGIL WHO IS THIS
WHICH HEARING HE APPROACH'D WITH EYES STILL BENT
TOWARD THAT GOODLY PRESENCE TH' OTHER SEIZ'D HER
AND HER ROBES TEARING OPEN'D HER BEFORE
AND SHOW'D THE BELLY TO ME WHENCE A SMELL
EXHALING LOATHSOME WAK'D ME
ROUND I TURN'D
MINE EYES AND THUS THE TEACHER AT THE LEAST
THREE TIMES MY VOICE HATH CALL'D THEE
RISE BEGONE
LET US THE OPENING FIND WHERE THOU MAYST PASS
I STRAIGHTWAY ROSE
NOW DAY POUR'D DOWN FROM HIGH
FILL'D ALL THE CIRCUITS OF THE SACRED MOUNT
AND AS WE JOURNEY'D ON OUR SHOULDER SMOTE
THE EARLY RAY
I FOLLOW'D STOOPING LOW
MY FOREHEAD AS A MAN O'ERCHARG'D WITH THOUGHT
WHO BENDS HIM TO THE LIKENESS OF AN ARCH
THAT MIDWAY SPANS THE FLOOD WHEN THUS I HEARD
COME ENTER HERE IN TONE SO SOFT AND MILD
AS NEVER MET THE EAR ON MORTAL STRAND
WITH SWAN LIKE WINGS DISPREAD AND POINTING UP
WHO THUS HAD SPOKEN MARSHAL'D US ALONG
WHERE EACH SIDE OF THE SOLID MASONRY
THE SLOPING WALLS RETIR'D THEN MOV'D HIS PLUMES
AND FANNING US AFFIRM'D THAT THOSE WHO MOURN
ARE BLESSED FOR THAT COMFORT SHALL BE THEIRS
WHAT AILETH THEE THAT STILL THOU LOOK'ST TO EARTH
BEGAN MY LEADER WHILE TH' ANGELIC SHAPE
A LITTLE OVER US HIS STATION TOOK
NEW VISION I REPLIED HATH RAIS'D IN ME
SURMISINGS STRANGE AND ANXIOUS DOUBTS WHEREON
MY SOUL INTENT ALLOWS NO OTHER THOUGHT
OR ROOM OR ENTRANCE HAST THOU SEEN SAID HE
THAT OLD ENCHANTRESS HER WHOSE WILES ALONE
THE SPIRITS O'ER US WEEP FOR HAST THOU SEEN
HOW MAN MAY FREE HIM OF HER BONDS ENOUGH
LET THY HEELS SPURN THE EARTH AND THY RAIS'D KEN
FIX ON THE LURE WHICH HEAV'N'S ETERNAL KING
WHIRLS IN THE ROLLING SPHERES AS ON HIS FEET
THE FALCON FIRST LOOKS DOWN THEN TO THE SKY
TURNS AND FORTH STRETCHES EAGER FOR THE FOOD
THAT WOOS HIM THITHER SO THE CALL I HEARD
SO ONWARD FAR AS THE DIVIDING ROCK
GAVE WAY I JOURNEY'D TILL THE PLAIN WAS REACH'D
ON THE FIFTH CIRCLE WHEN I STOOD AT LARGE
A RACE APPEAR'D BEFORE ME ON THE GROUND
ALL DOWNWARD LYING PRONE AND WEEPING SORE
MY SOUL HATH CLEAVED TO THE DUST I HEARD
WITH SIGHS SO DEEP THEY WELL NIGH CHOAK'D THE WORDS
O YE ELECT OF GOD WHOSE PENAL WOES
BOTH HOPE AND JUSTICE MITIGATE DIRECT
TOW'RDS THE STEEP RISING OUR UNCERTAIN WAY
IF YE APPROACH SECURE FROM THIS OUR DOOM
PROSTRATION AND WOULD URGE YOUR COURSE WITH SPEED
SEE THAT YE STILL TO RIGHTWARD KEEP THE BRINK
SO THEM THE BARD BESOUGHT AND SUCH THE WORDS
BEYOND US SOME SHORT SPACE IN ANSWER CAME
I NOTED WHAT REMAIN'D YET HIDDEN FROM THEM
THENCE TO MY LIEGE'S EYES MINE EYES I BENT
AND HE FORTHWITH INTERPRETING THEIR SUIT
BECKON'D HIS GLAD ASSENT
FREE THEN TO ACT
AS PLEAS'D ME I DREW NEAR AND TOOK MY STAND
O ER THAT SHADE WHOSE WORDS I LATE HAD MARK'D
AND SPIRIT I SAID IN WHOM REPENTANT TEARS
MATURE THAT BLESSED HOUR WHEN THOU WITH GOD
SHALT FIND ACCEPTANCE FOR A WHILE SUSPEND
FOR ME THAT MIGHTIER CARE
SAY WHO THOU WAST
WHY THUS YE GROVEL ON YOUR BELLIES PRONE
AND IF IN AUGHT YE WISH MY SERVICE THERE
WHENCE LIVING I AM COME HE ANSWERING SPAKE
THE CAUSE WHY HEAV'N OUR BACK TOWARD HIS COPE
REVERSES SHALT THOU KNOW BUT ME KNOW FIRST
THE SUCCESSOR OF PETER AND THE NAME
AND TITLE OF MY LINEAGE FROM THAT STREAM
THAT' TWIXT CHIAVERI AND SIESTRI DRAWS
HIS LIMPID WATERS THROUGH THE LOWLY GLEN
A MONTH AND LITTLE MORE BY PROOF I LEARNT
WITH WHAT A WEIGHT THAT ROBE OF SOV'REIGNTY
UPON HIS SHOULDER RESTS WHO FROM THE MIRE
WOULD GUARD IT THAT EACH OTHER FARDEL SEEMS
BUT FEATHERS IN THE BALANCE
LATE ALAS
WAS MY CONVERSION BUT WHEN I BECAME
ROME'S PASTOR I DISCERN'D AT ONCE THE DREAM
AND COZENAGE OF LIFE SAW THAT THE HEART
RESTED NOT THERE AND YET NO PROUDER HEIGHT
LUR'D ON THE CLIMBER WHEREFORE OF THAT LIFE
NO MORE ENAMOUR'D IN MY BOSOM LOVE
OF PURER BEING KINDLED
FOR TILL THEN
I WAS A SOUL IN MISERY ALIENATE
FROM GOD AND COVETOUS OF ALL EARTHLY THINGS
NOW AS THOU SEEST HERE PUNISH'D FOR MY DOTING
SUCH CLEANSING FROM THE TAINT OF AVARICE
DO SPIRITS CONVERTED NEED
THIS MOUNT INFLICTS
NO DIRER PENALTY
E'EN AS OUR EYES
FASTEN'D BELOW NOR E'ER TO LOFTIER CLIME
WERE LIFTED THUS HATH JUSTICE LEVEL'D US
HERE ON THE EARTH
AS AVARICE QUENCH'D OUR LOVE
OF GOOD WITHOUT WHICH IS NO WORKING THUS
HERE JUSTICE HOLDS US PRISON'D HAND AND FOOT
CHAIN'D DOWN AND BOUND WHILE HEAVEN'S JUST LORD SHALL PLEASE
SO LONG TO TARRY MOTIONLESS OUTSTRETCH'D
MY KNEES I STOOP'D AND WOULD HAVE SPOKE BUT HE

AND INWARD AWE OF YOUR HIGH DIGNITY
UP HE EXCLAIM'D BROTHER UPON THY FEET
ARISE ERR NOT THY FELLOW SERVANT I
THINE AND ALL OTHERS' OF ONE SOVRAN POWER
IF THOU HAST EVER MARK'D THOSE HOLY SOUNDS
OF GOSPEL TRUTH 'NOR SHALL BE GIVEN ILL MARRIAGE
THOU MAYST DISCERN THE REASONS OF MY SPEECH
GO THY WAYS NOW AND LINGER HERE NO MORE
THY TARRYING IS A LET UNTO THE TEARS
WITH WHICH I HASTEN THAT WHEREOF THOU SPAK'ST

CANTO XX
ILL STRIVES THE WILL 'GAINST WILL MORE WISE THAT STRIVES
HIS PLEASURE THEREFORE TO MINE OWN PREFERR'D
I DREW THE SPONGE YET THIRSTY FROM THE WAVE
ONWARD I MOV'D HE ALSO ONWARD MOV'D
WHO LED ME COASTING STILL WHEREVER PLACE
ALONG THE ROCK WAS VACANT AS A MAN
WALKS NEAR THE BATTLEMENTS ON NARROW WALL
FOR THOSE ON TH' OTHER PART WHO DROP BY DROP
WRING OUT THEIR ALL INFECTING MALADY
TOO CLOSELY PRESS THE VERGE
ACCURST BE THOU
INVETERATE WOLF WHOSE GORGE INGLUTS MORE PREY
THAN EVERY BEAST BESIDE YET IS NOT FILL'D
SO BOTTOMLESS THY MAW YE SPHERES OF HEAVEN
TO WHOM THERE ARE AS SEEMS WHO ATTRIBUTE
ALL CHANGE IN MORTAL STATE WHEN IS THE DAY
OF HIS APPEARING FOR WHOM FATE RESERVES
TO CHASE HER HENCE WITH WARY STEPS AND SLOW
WE PASS'D AND I ATTENTIVE TO THE SHADES
WHOM PITEOUSLY I HEARD LAMENT AND WAIL
AND 'MIDST THE WAILING ONE BEFORE US HEARD
CRY OUT O BLESSED VIRGIN AS A DAME
IN THE SHARP PANGS OF CHILDBED AND HOW POOR
THOU WAST IT ADDED WITNESS THAT LOW ROOF
WHERE THOU DIDST LAY THY SACRED BURDEN DOWN
O GOOD FABRICIUS THOU DIDST VIRTUE CHOOSE
WITH POVERTY BEFORE GREAT WEALTH WITH VICE
THE WORDS SO PLEAS'D ME THAT DESIRE TO KNOW
THE SPIRIT FROM WHOSE LIP THEY SEEM'D TO COME
DID DRAW ME ONWARD
YET IT SPAKE THE GIFT
OF NICHOLAS WHICH ON THE MAIDENS HE
BOUNTEOUS BESTOW'D TO SAVE THEIR YOUTHFUL PRIME
UNBLEMISH'D
SPIRIT WHO DOST SPEAK OF DEEDS
SO WORTHY TELL ME WHO THOU WAS I SAID
AND WHY THOU DOST WITH SINGLE VOICE RENEW
MEMORIAL OF SUCH PRAISE
THAT BOON VOUCHSAF'D
HAPLY SHALL MEET REWARD IF I RETURN
TO FINISH THE SHORT PILGRIMAGE OF LIFE
STILL SPEEDING TO ITS CLOSE ON RESTLESS WING
I ANSWER'D HE WILL TELL THEE NOT FOR HELL
WHICH THENCE I LOOK FOR BUT THAT IN THYSELF
GRACE SO EXCEEDING SHINES BEFORE THY TIME
OF MORTAL DISSOLUTION
I WAS ROOT
OF THAT ILL PLANT WHOSE SHADE SUCH POISON SHEDS
O'ER ALL THE CHRISTIAN LAND THAT SELDOM THENCE
GOOD FRUIT IS GATHER'D
VENGEANCE SOON SHOULD COME
HAD GHENT AND DOUAY LILLE AND BRUGES POWER
AND VENGEANCE I OF HEAV'N'S GREAT JUDGE IMPLORE
HUGH CAPET WAS I HIGH FROM ME DESCEND
THE PHILIPS AND THE LOUIS OF WHOM FRANCE
NEWLY IS GOVERN'D BORN OF ONE WHO PLY'D
THE SLAUGHTERER'S TRADE AT PARIS
WHEN THE RACE
OF ANCIENT KINGS HAD VANISH'D ALL SAVE ONE
WRAPT UP IN SABLE WEEDS WITHIN MY GRIPE
I FOUND THE REINS OF EMPIRE AND SUCH POWERS
OF NEW ACQUIREMENT WITH FULL STORE OF FRIENDS
THAT SOON THE WIDOW'D CIRCLET OF THE CROWN
WAS GIRT UPON THE TEMPLES OF MY SON
HE FROM WHOSE BONES TH' ANOINTED RACE BEGINS
TILL THE GREAT DOWER OF PROVENCE HAD REMOV'D
THE STAINS THAT YET OBSCUR'D OUR LOWLY BLOOD
ITS SWAY INDEED WAS NARROW BUT HOWE'ER
IT WROUGHT NO EVIL THERE WITH FORCE AND LIES
BEGAN ITS RAPINE AFTER FOR AMENDS
POITOU IT SEIZ'D NAVARRE AND GASCONY
TO ITALY CAME CHARLES AND FOR AMENDS
YOUNG CONRADINE AN INNOCENT VICTIM SLEW
AND SENT TH' ANGELIC TEACHER BACK TO HEAV'N
STILL FOR AMENDS
I SEE THE TIME AT HAND
THAT FORTH FROM FRANCE INVITES ANOTHER CHARLES
TO MAKE HIMSELF AND KINDRED BETTER KNOWN
UNARM'D HE ISSUES SAVING WITH THAT LANCE
WHICH THE ARCH TRAITOR TILTED WITH AND THAT
HE CARRIES WITH SO HOME A THRUST AS RIVES
THE BOWELS OF POOR FLORENCE
NO INCREASE
OF TERRITORY HENCE BUT SIN AND SHAME
SHALL BE HIS GUERDON AND SO MUCH THE MORE
AS HE MORE LIGHTLY DEEMS OF SUCH FOUL WRONG
I SEE THE OTHER WHO A PRISONER LATE
HAD STEPS ON SHORE EXPOSING TO THE MART
HIS DAUGHTER WHOM HE BARGAINS FOR AS DO
THE CORSAIRS FOR THEIR SLAVES
O AVARICE
WHAT CANST THOU MORE WHO HAST SUBDUED OUR BLOOD
SO WHOLLY TO THYSELF THEY FEEL NO CARE
OF THEIR OWN FLESH TO HIDE WITH DIRER GUILT
PAST ILL AND FUTURE LO THE FLOWER DE LUCE
ENTERS ALAGNA IN HIS VICAR CHRIST
HIMSELF A CAPTIVE AND HIS MOCKERY
ACTED AGAIN LO TO HIS HOLY LIP
THE VINEGAR AND GALL ONCE MORE APPLIED
AND HE 'TWIXT LIVING ROBBERS DOOM'D TO BLEED
LO THE NEW PILATE OF WHOSE CRUELTY
SUCH VIOLENCE CANNOT FILL THE MEASURE UP
WITH NO DEGREE TO SANCTION PUSHES ON
INTO THE TEMPLE HIS YET EAGER SAILS
O SOVRAN MASTER WHEN SHALL I REJOICE
TO SEE THE VENGEANCE WHICH THY WRATH WELL PLEAS'D
IN SECRET SILENCE BROODS WHILE DAYLIGHT LASTS
SO LONG WHAT THOU DIDST HEAR OF HER SOLE SPOUSE
OF THE GREAT SPIRIT AND ON WHICH THOU TURN'DST
TO ME FOR COMMENT IS THE GENERAL THEME
OF ALL OUR PRAYERS BUT WHEN IT DARKENS THEN
A DIFFERENT STRAIN WE UTTER THEN RECORD
PYGMALION WHOM HIS GLUTTONOUS THIRST OF GOLD
MADE TRAITOR ROBBER PARRICIDE THE WOES
OF MIDAS WHICH HIS GREEDY WISH ENSUED
MARK'D FOR DERISION TO ALL FUTURE TIMES
AND THE FOND ACHAN HOW HE STOLE THE PREY
THAT YET HE SEEMS BY JOSHUA'S IRE PURSUED
SAPPHIRA WITH HER HUSBAND NEXT WE BLAME
AND PRAISE THE FOREFEET THAT WITH FURIOUS RAMP
SPURN'D HELIODORUS
ALL THE MOUNTAIN ROUND
RINGS WITH THE INFAMY OF THRACIA'S KING
WHO SLEW HIS PHRYGIAN CHARGE AND LAST A SHOUT
ASCENDS DECLARE O CRASSUS FOR THOU KNOW'ST
THE FLAVOUR OF THY GOLD THE VOICE OF EACH
NOW HIGH NOW LOW AS EACH HIS IMPULSE PROMPTS
IS LED THROUGH MANY A PITCH ACUTE OR GRAVE
THEREFORE NOT SINGLY I EREWHILE REHEARS'D
THAT BLESSEDNESS WE TELL OF IN THE DAY
BUT NEAR ME NONE BESIDE HIS ACCENT RAIS'D
FROM HIM WE NOW HAD PARTED AND ESSAY'D
WITH UTMOST EFFORTS TO SURMOUNT THE WAY
WHEN I DID FEEL AS NODDING TO ITS FALL
THE MOUNTAIN TREMBLE WHENCE AN ICY CHILL
SEIZ'D ON ME AS ON ONE TO DEATH CONVEY'D
SO SHOOK NOT DELOS WHEN LATONA THERE
COUCH'D TO BRING FORTH THE TWIN BORN EYES OF HEAVEN
FORTHWITH FROM EVERY SIDE A SHOUT AROSE
SO VEHEMENT THAT SUDDENLY MY GUIDE
DREW NEAR AND CRIED DOUBT NOT WHILE I CONDUCT THEE
GLORY ALL SHOUTED SUCH THE SOUNDS MINE EAR
GATHER'D FROM THOSE WHO NEAR ME SWELL'D THE SOUNDS
GLORY IN THE HIGHEST BE TO GOD WE STOOD
IMMOVABLY SUSPENDED LIKE TO THOSE
THE SHEPHERDS WHO FIRST HEARD IN BETHLEHEM'S FIELD
THAT SONG TILL CEAS'D THE TREMBLING AND THE SONG
WAS ENDED THEN OUR HALLOW'D PATH RESUM'D
EYING THE PROSTRATE SHADOWS WHO RENEW'D
THEIR CUSTOM'D MOURNING
NEVER IN MY BREAST
DID IGNORANCE SO STRUGGLE WITH DESIRE
OF KNOWLEDGE IF MY MEMORY DO NOT ERR
AS IN THAT MOMENT NOR THROUGH HASTE DAR'D I
TO QUESTION NOR MYSELF COULD AUGHT DISCERN
SO ON I FAR'D IN THOUGHTFULNESS AND DREAD
CANTO XXI
THE NATURAL THIRST NE'ER QUENCH'D BUT FROM THE WELL
WHEREOF THE WOMAN OF SAMARIA CRAV'D
EXCITED HASTE ALONG THE CUMBER'D PATH
AFTER MY GUIDE IMPELL'D AND PITY MOV'D
MY BOSOM FOR THE 'VENGEFUL DEED THOUGH JUST
WHEN LO EVEN AS LUKE RELATES THAT CHRIST
APPEAR'D UNTO THE TWO UPON THEIR WAY
NEW RISEN FROM HIS VAULTED GRAVE TO US
A SHADE APPEAR'D AND AFTER US APPROACH'D
CONTEMPLATING THE CROWD BENEATH ITS FEET
WE WERE NOT WARE OF IT SO FIRST IT SPAKE
SAYING GOD GIVE YOU PEACE MY BRETHREN THEN
SUDDEN WE TURN'D AND VIRGIL SUCH SALUTE
AS FITTED THAT KIND GREETING GAVE AND CRIED
PEACE IN THE BLESSED COUNCIL BE THY LOT
AWARDED BY THAT RIGHTEOUS COURT WHICH ME
TO EVERLASTING BANISHMENT EXILES
HOW HE EXCLAIM'D NOR FROM HIS SPEED MEANWHILE
DESISTING IF THAT YE BE SPIRITS WHOM GOD
VOUCHSAFES NOT ROOM ABOVE WHO UP THE HEIGHT
HAS BEEN THUS FAR YOUR GUIDE TO WHOM THE BARD
IF THOU OBSERVE THE TOKENS WHICH THIS MAN
TRAC'D BY THE FINGER OF THE ANGEL BEARS
'TIS PLAIN THAT IN THE KINGDOM OF THE JUST
HE NEEDS MUST SHARE
BUT SITHENCE SHE WHOSE WHEEL
SPINS DAY AND NIGHT FOR HIM NOT YET HAD DRAWN
THAT YARN WHICH ON THE FATAL DISTAFF PIL'D
CLOTHO APPORTIONS TO EACH WIGHT THAT BREATHES
HIS SOUL THAT SISTER IS TO MINE AND THINE
NOT OF HERSELF COULD MOUNT FOR NOT LIKE OURS
HER KEN WHENCE I FROM FORTH THE AMPLE GULF
OF HELL WAS TA'EN TO LEAD HIM AND WILL LEAD
FAR AS MY LORE AVAILS
BUT IF THOU KNOW
INSTRUCT US FOR WHAT CAUSE THE MOUNT EREWHILE
THUS SHOOK AND TREMBLED WHEREFORE ALL AT ONCE
SEEM'D SHOUTING EVEN FROM HIS WAVE WASH'D FOOT
THAT QUESTIONING SO TALLIED WITH MY WISH
THE THIRST DID FEEL ABATEMENT OF ITS EDGE
E'EN FROM EXPECTANCE
HE FORTHWITH REPLIED
IN ITS DEVOTION NOUGHT IRREGULAR
THIS MOUNT CAN WITNESS OR BY PUNCTUAL RULE
UNSANCTION'D HERE FROM EVERY CHANGE EXEMPT
OTHER THAN THAT WHICH HEAVEN IN ITSELF
DOTH OF ITSELF RECEIVE NO INFLUENCE
CAN REACH US
TEMPEST NONE SHOWER HAIL OR SNOW
HOAR FROST OR DEWY MOISTNESS HIGHER FALLS
THAN THAT BRIEF SCALE OF THREEFOLD STEPS THICK CLOUDS
NOR SCUDDING RACK ARE EVER SEEN SWIFT GLANCE
NE'ER LIGHTENS NOR THAUMANTIAN IRIS GLEAMS
THAT YONDER OFTEN SHIFT ON EACH SIDE HEAV'N
VAPOUR ADUST DOTH NEVER MOUNT ABOVE
THE HIGHEST OF THE TRINAL STAIRS WHEREON
PETER'S VICEGERENT STANDS
LOWER PERCHANCE
WITH VARIOUS MOTION ROCK'D TREMBLES THE SOIL
BUT HERE THROUGH WIND IN EARTH'S DEEP HOLLOW PENT
I KNOW NOT HOW YET NEVER TREMBLED THEN
TREMBLES WHEN ANY SPIRIT FEELS ITSELF
SO PURIFIED THAT IT MAY RISE OR MOVE
FOR RISING AND SUCH LOUD ACCLAIM ENSUES
PURIFICATION BY THE WILL ALONE
IS PROV'D THAT FREE TO CHANGE SOCIETY
SEIZES THE SOUL REJOICING IN HER WILL
DESIRE OF BLISS IS PRESENT FROM THE FIRST
BUT STRONG PROPENSION HINDERS TO THAT WISH
BY THE JUST ORDINANCE OF HEAV'N OPPOS'D
PROPENSION NOW AS EAGER TO FULFIL
TH' ALLOTTED TORMENT AS EREWHILE TO SIN
AND I WHO IN THIS PUNISHMENT HAD LAIN
FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE BUT NOW HAVE FELT
FREE WISH FOR HAPPIER CLIME
THEREFORE THOU FELT'ST
THE MOUNTAIN TREMBLE AND THE SPIRITS DEVOUT
HEARD'ST OVER ALL HIS LIMITS UTTER PRAISE
TO THAT LIEGE LORD WHOM I ENTREAT THEIR JOY
TO HASTEN THUS HE SPAKE AND SINCE THE DRAUGHT
IS GRATEFUL EVER AS THE THIRST IS KEEN
NO WORDS MAY SPEAK MY FULLNESS OF CONTENT
NOW SAID THE INSTRUCTOR SAGE I SEE THE NET
THAT TAKES YE HERE AND HOW THE TOILS ARE LOOS'D
WHY ROCKS THE MOUNTAIN AND WHY YE REJOICE
VOUCHSAFE THAT FROM THY LIPS I NEXT MAY LEARN
WHO ON THE EARTH THOU WAST AND WHEREFORE HERE
SO MANY AN AGE WERT PROSTRATE IN THAT TIME
WHEN THE GOOD TITUS WITH HEAV'N'S KING TO HELP
AVENG'D THOSE PITEOUS GASHES WHENCE THE BLOOD
BY JUDAS SOLD DID ISSUE WITH THE NAME
MOST LASTING AND MOST HONOUR'D THERE WAS I
ABUNDANTLY RENOWN'D THE SHADE REPLY'D
NOT YET WITH FAITH ENDUED
SO PASSING SWEET
MY VOCAL SPIRIT FROM TOLOSA ROME
TO HERSELF DREW ME WHERE I MERITED
A MYRTLE GARLAND TO INWREATHE MY BROW
STATIUS THEY NAME ME STILL
OF THEBES I SANG
AND NEXT OF GREAT ACHILLES BUT I' TH' WAY
FELL WITH THE SECOND BURTHEN
OF MY FLAME
THOSE SPARKLES WERE THE SEEDS WHICH I DERIV'D
FROM THE BRIGHT FOUNTAIN OF CELESTIAL FIRE
THAT FEEDS UNNUMBER'D LAMPS THE SONG I MEAN
WHICH SOUNDS AENEAS' WAND'RINGS THAT THE BREAST
I HUNG AT THAT THE NURSE FROM WHOM MY VEINS
DRANK INSPIRATION WHOSE AUTHORITY
WAS EVER SACRED WITH ME
TO HAVE LIV'D
COEVAL WITH THE MANTUAN I WOULD BIDE
THE REVOLUTION OF ANOTHER SUN
BEYOND MY STATED YEARS IN BANISHMENT
THE MANTUAN WHEN HE HEARD HIM TURN'D TO ME
AND HOLDING SILENCE BY HIS COUNTENANCE
ENJOIN'D ME SILENCE BUT THE POWER WHICH WILLS
BEARS NOT SUPREME CONTROL LAUGHTER AND TEARS
FOLLOW SO CLOSELY ON THE PASSION PROMPTS THEM
THEY WAIT NOT FOR THE MOTIONS OF THE WILL
IN NATURES MOST SINCERE
I DID BUT SMILE
AS ONE WHO WINKS AND THEREUPON THE SHADE
BROKE OFF AND PEER'D INTO MINE EYES WHERE BEST
OUR LOOKS INTERPRET
SO TO GOOD EVENT
MAYST THOU CONDUCT SUCH GREAT EMPRIZE HE CRIED
SAY WHY ACROSS THY VISAGE BEAM'D BUT NOW
THE LIGHTNING OF A SMILE ON EITHER PART
NOW AM I STRAITEN'D ONE CONJURES ME SPEAK
TH' OTHER TO SILENCE BINDS ME WHENCE A SIGH
I UTTER AND THE SIGH IS HEARD
SPEAK ON
THE TEACHER CRIED AND DO NOT FEAR TO SPEAK
BUT TELL HIM WHAT SO EARNESTLY HE ASKS
WHEREON I THUS PERCHANCE O ANCIENT SPIRIT
THOU MARVEL'ST AT MY SMILING
THERE IS ROOM
FOR YET MORE WONDER
HE WHO GUIDES MY KEN
ON HIGH HE IS THAT MANTUAN LED BY WHOM
THOU DIDST PRESUME OF MEN AND GODS TO SING
IF OTHER CAUSE THOU DEEM'DST FOR WHICH I SMIL'D
LEAVE IT AS NOT THE TRUE ONE AND BELIEVE
THOSE WORDS THOU SPAK'ST OF HIM INDEED THE CAUSE
NOW DOWN HE BENT T' EMBRACE MY TEACHER'S FEET
BUT HE FORBADE HIM BROTHER DO IT NOT
THOU ART A SHADOW AND BEHOLD'ST A SHADE
HE RISING ANSWER'D THUS NOW HAST THOU PROV'D
THE FORCE AND ARDOUR OF THE LOVE I BEAR THEE
WHEN I FORGET WE ARE BUT THINGS OF AIR
AND AS A SUBSTANCE TREAT AN EMPTY SHADE
CANTO XXII
NOW WE HAD LEFT THE ANGEL WHO HAD TURN'D
TO THE SIXTH CIRCLE OUR ASCENDING STEP
ONE GASH FROM OFF MY FOREHEAD RAZ'D WHILE THEY
WHOSE WISHES TEND TO JUSTICE SHOUTED FORTH
BLESSED AND ENDED WITH I THIRST AND I
MORE NIMBLE THAN ALONG THE OTHER STRAITS
SO JOURNEY'D THAT WITHOUT THE SENSE OF TOIL
I FOLLOW'D UPWARD THE SWIFT FOOTED SHADES
WHEN VIRGIL THUS BEGAN LET ITS PURE FLAME
FROM VIRTUE FLOW AND LOVE CAN NEVER FAIL
TO WARM ANOTHER'S BOSOM' SO THE LIGHT
SHINE MANIFESTLY FORTH
HENCE FROM THAT HOUR
WHEN 'MONGST US IN THE PURLIEUS OF THE DEEP
CAME DOWN THE SPIRIT OF AQUINUM'S HARD
WHO TOLD OF THINE AFFECTION MY GOOD WILL
HATH BEEN FOR THEE OF QUALITY AS STRONG
AS EVER LINK'D ITSELF TO ONE NOT SEEN
THEREFORE THESE STAIRS WILL NOW SEEM SHORT TO ME
BUT TELL ME AND IF TOO SECURE I LOOSE
THE REIN WITH A FRIEND'S LICENSE AS A FRIEND
FORGIVE ME AND SPEAK NOW AS WITH A FRIEND
HOW CHANC'D IT COVETOUS DESIRE COULD FIND
PLACE IN THAT BOSOM 'MIDST SUCH AMPLE STORE
OF WISDOM AS THY ZEAL HAD TREASUR'D THERE
FIRST SOMEWHAT MOV'D TO LAUGHTER BY HIS WORDS
STATIUS REPLIED EACH SYLLABLE OF THINE
IS A DEAR PLEDGE OF LOVE
THINGS OFT APPEAR
THAT MINISTER FALSE MATTERS TO OUR DOUBTS
WHEN THEIR TRUE CAUSES ARE REMOV'D FROM SIGHT
THY QUESTION DOTH ASSURE ME THOU BELIEV'ST
I WAS ON EARTH A COVETOUS MAN PERHAPS
BECAUSE THOU FOUND'ST ME IN THAT CIRCLE PLAC'D
KNOW THEN I WAS TOO WIDE OF AVARICE
AND E'EN FOR THAT EXCESS THOUSANDS OF MOONS
HAVE WAX'D AND WAN'D UPON MY SUFFERINGS
AND WERE IT NOT THAT I WITH HEEDFUL CARE
NOTED WHERE THOU EXCLAIM'ST AS IF IN IRE
WITH HUMAN NATURE 'WHY THOU CURSED THIRST
OF GOLD DOST NOT WITH JUSTER MEASURE GUIDE
THE APPETITE OF MORTALS I HAD MET
THE FIERCE ENCOUNTER OF THE VOLUBLE ROCK
THEN WAS I WARE THAT WITH TOO AMPLE WING
THE HANDS MAY HASTE TO LAVISHMENT AND TURN'D
AS FROM MY OTHER EVIL SO FROM THIS
IN PENITENCE
HOW MANY FROM THEIR GRAVE
SHALL WITH SHORN LOCKS ARISE WHO LIVING AYE
AND AT LIFE'S LAST EXTREME OF THIS OFFENCE
THROUGH IGNORANCE DID NOT REPENT
AND KNOW
THE FAULT WHICH LIES DIRECT FROM ANY SIN
IN LEVEL OPPOSITION HERE WITH THAT
WASTES ITS GREEN RANKNESS ON ONE COMMON HEAP
THEREFORE IF I HAVE BEEN WITH THOSE WHO WAIL
THEIR AVARICE TO CLEANSE ME THROUGH REVERSE
OF THEIR TRANSGRESSION SUCH HATH BEEN MY LOT
TO WHOM THE SOVRAN OF THE PASTORAL SONG
WHILE THOU DIDST SING THAT CRUEL WARFARE WAG'D
BY THE TWIN SORROW OF JOCASTA'S WOMB
FROM THY DISCOURSE WITH CLIO THERE IT SEEMS
AS FAITH HAD NOT BEEN SHINE WITHOUT THE WHICH
GOOD DEEDS SUFFICE NOT
AND IF SO WHAT SUN
ROSE ON THEE OR WHAT CANDLE PIERC'D THE DARK
THAT THOU DIDST AFTER SEE TO HOIST THE SAIL
AND FOLLOW WHERE THE FISHERMAN HAD LED
HE ANSWERING THUS BY THEE CONDUCTED FIRST
I ENTER'D THE PARNASSIAN GROTS AND QUAFF'D
OF THE CLEAR SPRING ILLUMIN'D FIRST BY THEE
OPEN'D MINE EYES TO GOD
THOU DIDST AS ONE
WHO JOURNEYING THROUGH THE DARKNESS HEARS A LIGHT
BEHIND THAT PROFITS NOT HIMSELF BUT MAKES
HIS FOLLOWERS WISE WHEN THOU EXCLAIMEDST 'LO
A RENOVATED WORLD JUSTICE RETURN'D
TIMES OF PRIMEVAL INNOCENCE RESTOR'D
AND A NEW RACE DESCENDED FROM ABOVE
POET AND CHRISTIAN BOTH TO THEE I OWED
THAT THOU MAYST MARK MORE CLEARLY WHAT I TRACE
MY HAND SHALL STRETCH FORTH TO INFORM THE LINES
WITH LIVELIER COLOURING
SOON O'ER ALL THE WORLD
BY MESSENGERS FROM HEAV'N THE TRUE BELIEF
TEEM'D NOW PROLIFIC AND THAT WORD OF THINE
ACCORDANT TO THE NEW INSTRUCTORS CHIM'D
INDUC'D BY WHICH AGREEMENT I WAS WONT
RESORT TO THEM AND SOON THEIR SANCTITY
SO WON UPON ME THAT DOMITIAN'S RAGE
PURSUING THEM I MIX'D MY TEARS WITH THEIRS
AND WHILE ON EARTH I STAY'D STILL SUCCOUR'D THEM
AND THEIR MOST RIGHTEOUS CUSTOMS MADE ME SCORN
ALL SECTS BESIDES
BEFORE I LED THE GREEKS
IN TUNEFUL FICTION TO THE STREAMS OF THEBES
I WAS BAPTIZ'D BUT SECRETLY THROUGH FEAR
REMAIN'D A CHRISTIAN AND CONFORM'D LONG TIME
TO PAGAN RITES
FIVE CENTURIES AND MORE
T FOR THAT LUKEWARMNESS WAS FAIN TO PACE
ROUND THE FOURTH CIRCLE
THOU THEN WHO HAST RAIS'D
THE COVERING WHICH DID HIDE SUCH BLESSING FROM ME
WHILST MUCH OF THIS ASCENT IS YET TO CLIMB
SAY IF THOU KNOW WHERE OUR OLD TERENCE BIDES
CAECILIUS PLAUTUS VARRO IF CONDEMN'D
THEY DWELL AND IN WHAT PROVINCE OF THE DEEP
THESE SAID MY GUIDE WITH PERSIUS AND MYSELF
AND OTHERS MANY MORE ARE WITH THAT GREEK
OF MORTALS THE MOST CHERISH'D BY THE NINE
IN THE FIRST WARD OF DARKNESS
THERE OFTTIMES
WE OF THAT MOUNT HOLD CONVERSE ON WHOSE TOP
FOR AYE OUR NURSES LIVE
WE HAVE THE BARD
OF PELLA AND THE TEIAN AGATHO
SIMONIDES AND MANY A GRECIAN ELSE
INGARLANDED WITH LAUREL
OF THY TRAIN
ANTIGONE IS THERE DEIPHILE
ARGIA AND AS SORROWFUL AS ERST
ISMENE AND WHO SHOW'D LANGIA'S WAVE
DEIDAMIA WITH HER SISTERS THERE
AND BLIND TIRESIAS' DAUGHTER AND THE BRIDE
SEA BORN OF PELEUS EITHER POET NOW
WAS SILENT AND NO LONGER BY TH' ASCENT
OR THE STEEP WALLS OBSTRUCTED ROUND THEM CAST
INQUIRING EYES
FOUR HANDMAIDS OF THE DAY
HAD FINISH'D NOW THEIR OFFICE AND THE FIFTH
WAS AT THE CHARIOT BEAM DIRECTING STILL
ITS BALMY POINT ALOOF WHEN THUS MY GUIDE
METHINKS IT WELL BEHOOVES US TO THE BRINK
BEND THE RIGHT SHOULDER' CIRCUITING THE MOUNT
AS WE HAVE EVER US'D SO CUSTOM THERE
WAS USHER TO THE ROAD THE WHICH WE CHOSE
LESS DOUBTFUL AS THAT WORTHY SHADE COMPLIED
THEY ON BEFORE ME WENT I SOLE PURSUED
LIST'NING THEIR SPEECH THAT TO MY THOUGHTS CONVEY'D
MYSTERIOUS LESSONS OF SWEET POESY
BUT SOON THEY CEAS'D FOR MIDWAY OF THE ROAD
A TREE WE FOUND WITH GOODLY FRUITAGE HUNG
AND PLEASANT TO THE SMELL AND AS A FIR
UPWARD FROM BOUGH TO BOUGH LESS AMPLE SPREADS
SO DOWNWARD THIS LESS AMPLE SPREAD THAT NONE
METHINKS ALOFT MAY CLIMB
UPON THE SIDE
THAT CLOS'D OUR PATH A LIQUID CRYSTAL FELL
FROM THE STEEP ROCK AND THROUGH THE SPRAYS ABOVE
STREAM'D SHOWERING
WITH ASSOCIATE STEP THE BARDS
DREW NEAR THE PLANT AND FROM AMIDST THE LEAVES
A VOICE WAS HEARD YE SHALL BE CHARY OF ME
AND AFTER ADDED MARY TOOK MORE THOUGHT
FOR JOY AND HONOUR OF THE NUPTIAL FEAST
THAN FOR HERSELF WHO ANSWERS NOW FOR YOU
THE WOMEN OF OLD ROME WERE SATISFIED
WITH WATER FOR THEIR BEVERAGE
DANIEL FED
ON PULSE AND WISDOM GAIN'D
THE PRIMAL AGE
WAS BEAUTIFUL AS GOLD AND HUNGER THEN
MADE ACORNS TASTEFUL THIRST EACH RIVULET
RUN NECTAR
HONEY AND LOCUSTS WERE THE FOOD
WHEREON THE BAPTIST IN THE WILDERNESS
FED AND THAT EMINENCE OF GLORY REACH'D
AND GREATNESS WHICH THE' EVANGELIST RECORDS
CANTO XXIII
ON THE GREEN LEAF MINE EYES WERE FIX'D LIKE HIS
WHO THROWS AWAY HIS DAYS IN IDLE CHASE
OF THE DIMINUTIVE WHEN THUS I HEARD
THE MORE THAN FATHER WARN ME SON OUR TIME
ASKS THRIFTIER USING
LINGER NOT AWAY
THEREAT MY FACE AND STEPS AT ONCE I TURN'D
TOWARD THE SAGES BY WHOSE CONVERSE CHEER'D
I JOURNEY'D ON AND FELT NO TOIL AND LO
A SOUND OF WEEPING AND A SONG MY LIPS
O LORD AND THESE SO MINGLED IT GAVE BIRTH
TO PLEASURE AND TO PAIN
O SIRE BELOV'D
SAY WHAT IS THIS I HEAR THUS I INQUIR'D
SPIRITS SAID HE WHO AS THEY GO PERCHANCE
THEIR DEBT OF DUTY PAY AS ON THEIR ROAD
THE THOUGHTFUL PILGRIMS OVERTAKING SOME
NOT KNOWN UNTO THEM TURN TO THEM AND LOOK
BUT STAY NOT THUS APPROACHING FROM BEHIND
WITH SPEEDIER MOTION EYED US AS THEY PASS'D
A CROWD OF SPIRITS SILENT AND DEVOUT
THE EYES OF EACH WERE DARK AND HOLLOW PALE
THEIR VISAGE AND SO LEAN WITHAL THE BONES
STOOD STARING THRO' THE SKIN
I DO NOT THINK
THUS DRY AND MEAGRE ERISICTHON SHOW'D
WHEN PINC'ED BY SHARP SET FAMINE TO THE QUICK
LO TO MYSELF I MUS'D THE RACE WHO LOST
JERUSALEM WHEN MARY WITH DIRE BEAK
PREY'D ON HER CHILD THE SOCKETS SEEM'D AS RINGS
FROM WHICH THE GEMS WERE DROPS
WHO READS THE NAME
OF MAN UPON HIS FOREHEAD THERE THE M
HAD TRAC'D MOST PLAINLY
WHO WOULD DEEM THAT SCENT
OF WATER AND AN APPLE COULD HAVE PROV'D
POWERFUL TO GENERATE SUCH PINING WANT
NOT KNOWING HOW IT WROUGHT WHILE NOW I STOOD
WOND'RING WHAT THUS COULD WASTE THEM FOR THE CAUSE
OF THEIR GAUNT HOLLOWNESS AND SCALY RIND
APPEAR'D NOT LO A SPIRIT TURN'D HIS EYES
IN THEIR DEEP SUNKEN CELL AND FASTEN'D THEN
ON ME THEN CRIED WITH VEHEMENCE ALOUD
WHAT GRACE IS THIS VOUCHSAF'D ME BY HIS LOOKS
I NE'ER HAD RECOGNIZ'D HIM BUT THE VOICE
BROUGHT TO MY KNOWLEDGE WHAT HIS CHEER CONCEAL'D
REMEMBRANCE OF HIS ALTER'D LINEAMENTS
WAS KINDLED FROM THAT SPARK AND I AGNIZ'D
THE VISAGE OF FORESE
AH RESPECT
THIS WAN AND LEPROUS WITHER'D SKIN THUS HE
SUPPLIANT IMPLOR'D THIS MACERATED FLESH
SPEAK TO ME TRULY OF THYSELF
AND WHO
ARE THOSE TWAIN SPIRITS THAT ESCORT THEE THERE
BE IT NOT SAID THOU SCORN'ST TO TALK WITH ME
THAT FACE OF THINE I ANSWER'D HIM WHICH DEAD
I ONCE BEWAIL'D DISPOSES ME NOT LESS
FOR WEEPING WHEN I SEE IT THUS TRANSFORM'D
SAY THEN BY HEAV'N WHAT BLASTS YE THUS THE WHILST
I WONDER ASK NOT SPEECH FROM ME UNAPT
IS HE TO SPEAK WHOM OTHER WILL EMPLOYS
HE THUS THE WATER AND TEE PLANT WE PASS'D
VIRTUE POSSESSES BY TH' ETERNAL WILL
INFUS'D THE WHICH SO PINES ME
EVERY SPIRIT
WHOSE SONG BEWAILS HIS GLUTTONY INDULG'D
TOO GROSSLY HERE IN HUNGER AND IN THIRST
IS PURIFIED
THE ODOUR WHICH THE FRUIT
AND SPRAY THAT SHOWERS UPON THE VERDURE BREATHE
INFLAMES US WITH DESIRE TO FEED AND DRINK
NOR ONCE ALONE ENCOMPASSING OUR ROUTE
WE COME TO ADD FRESH FUEL TO THE PAIN
PAIN SAID IOLACE RATHER FOR THAT WILL
TO THE TREE LEADS US BY WHICH CHRIST WAS LED
TO CALL ELIAS JOYFUL WHEN HE PAID
OUR RANSOM FROM HIS VEIN I ANSWERING THUS
FORESE FROM THAT DAY IN WHICH THE WORLD
FOR BETTER LIFE THOU CHANGEDST NOT FIVE YEARS
HAVE CIRCLED
IF THE POWER OF SINNING MORE
WERE FIRST CONCLUDED IN THEE ERE THOU KNEW'ST
THAT KINDLY GRIEF WHICH RE ESPOUSES US
TO GOD HOW HITHER ART THOU COME SO SOON
I THOUGHT TO FIND THEE LOWER THERE WHERE TIME
IS RECOMPENSE FOR TIME HE STRAIGHT REPLIED
TO DRINK UP THE SWEET WORMWOOD OF AFFLICTION
I HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THUS EARLY BY THE TEARS
STREAM'D DOWN MY NELLA'S CHEEKS
HER PRAYERS DEVOUT
HER SIGHS HAVE DRAWN ME FROM THE COAST WHERE OFT
EXPECTANCE LINGERS AND HAVE SET ME FREE
FROM TH' OTHER CIRCLES
IN THE SIGHT OF GOD
SO MUCH THE DEARER IS MY WIDOW PRIZ'D
SHE WHOM I LOV'D SO FONDLY AS SHE RANKS
MORE SINGLY EMINENT FOR VIRTUOUS DEEDS
THE TRACT MOST BARB'ROUS OF SARDINIA'S ISLE
HATH DAMES MORE CHASTE AND MODESTER BY FAR
THAN THAT WHEREIN I LEFT HER
O SWEET BROTHER
WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE ME SAY A TIME TO COME
STANDS FULL WITHIN MY VIEW TO WHICH THIS HOUR
SHALL NOT BE COUNTED OF AN ANCIENT DATE
WHEN FROM THE PULPIT SHALL BE LOUDLY WARN'D
TH' UNBLUSHING DAMES OF FLORENCE LEST THEY BARE
UNKERCHIEF'D BOSOMS TO THE COMMON GAZE
WHAT SAVAGE WOMEN HATH THE WORLD E'ER SEEN
WHAT SARACENS FOR WHOM THERE NEEDED SCOURGE
OF SPIRITUAL OR OTHER DISCIPLINE
TO FORCE THEM WALK WITH COV'RING ON THEIR LIMBS
BUT DID THEY SEE THE SHAMELESS ONES THAT HEAV'N
WAFTS ON SWIFT WING TOWARD THEM WHILE I SPEAK
THEIR MOUTHS WERE OP'D FOR HOWLING THEY SHALL TASTE
OF BORROW UNLESS FORESIGHT CHEAT ME HERE
OR ERE THE CHEEK OF HIM BE CLOTH'D WITH DOWN
WHO IS NOW ROCK'D WITH LULLABY ASLEEP
AH NOW MY BROTHER HIDE THYSELF NO MORE
THOU SEEST HOW NOT I ALONE BUT ALL
GAZE WHERE THOU VEIL'ST THE INTERCEPTED SUN
WHENCE I REPLIED IF THOU RECALL TO MIND
WHAT WE WERE ONCE TOGETHER EVEN YET
REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE DAYS MAY GRIEVE THEE SORE
THAT I FORSOOK THAT LIFE WAS DUE TO HIM
WHO THERE PRECEDES ME SOME FEW EVENINGS PAST
WHEN SHE WAS ROUND WHO SHINES WITH SISTER LAMP
TO HIS THAT GLISTERS YONDER AND I SHOW'D
THE SUN
TIS HE WHO THROUGH PROFOUNDEST NIGHT
OF HE TRUE DEAD HAS BROUGHT ME WITH THIS FLESH
AS TRUE THAT FOLLOWS
FROM THAT GLOOM THE AID
OF HIS SURE COMFORT DREW ME ON TO CLIMB
AND CLIMBING WIND ALONG THIS MOUNTAIN STEEP
WHICH RECTIFIES IN YOU WHATE'ER THE WORLD
MADE CROOKED AND DEPRAV'D I HAVE HIS WORD
THAT HE WILL BEAR ME COMPANY AS FAR
AS TILL I COME WHERE BEATRICE DWELLS
BUT THERE MUST LEAVE ME
VIRGIL IS THAT SPIRIT
WHO THUS HATH PROMIS'D AND I POINTED TO HIM
THE OTHER IS THAT SHADE FOR WHOM SO LATE
YOUR REALM AS HE AROSE EXULTING SHOOK
THROUGH EVERY PENDENT CLIFF AND ROCKY BOUND
CANTO XXIV
OUR JOURNEY WAS NOT SLACKEN'D BY OUR TALK
NOR YET OUR TALK BY JOURNEYING
STILL WE SPAKE
AND URG'D OUR TRAVEL STOUTLY LIKE A SHIP
WHEN THE WIND SITS ASTERN
THE SHADOWY FORMS
THAT SEEM'D THINGS DEAD AND DEAD AGAIN DREW IN
AT THEIR DEEP DELVED ORBS RARE WONDER OF ME
PERCEIVING I HAD LIFE AND I MY WORDS
CONTINUED AND THUS SPAKE HE JOURNEYS UP
PERHAPS MORE TARDILY THEN ELSE HE WOULD
FOR OTHERS' SAKE
BUT TELL ME IF THOU KNOW'ST
WHERE IS PICCARDA TELL ME IF I SEE
ANY OF MARK AMONG THIS MULTITUDE
WHO EYE ME THUS MY SISTER SHE FOR WHOM
'TWIXT BEAUTIFUL AND GOOD I CANNOT SAY
WHICH NAME WAS FITTER WEARS E'EN NOW HER CROWN
AND TRIUMPHS IN OLYMPUS SAYING THIS
HE ADDED SINCE SPARE DIET HATH SO WORN
OUR SEMBLANCE OUT 'T IS LAWFUL HERE TO NAME
EACH ONE
THIS AND HIS FINGER THEN HE RAIS'D
IS BUONAGGIUNA BUONAGGIUNA HE
OF LUCCA AND THAT FACE BEYOND HIM PIERC'D
UNTO A LEANER FINENESS THAN THE REST
HAD KEEPING OF THE CHURCH HE WAS OF TOURS
AND PURGES BY WAN ABSTINENCE AWAY
BOLSENA'S EELS AND CUPS OF MUSCADEL
HE SHOW'D ME MANY OTHERS ONE BY ONE
AND ALL AS THEY WERE NAM'D SEEM'D WELL CONTENT
FOR NO DARK GESTURE I DISCERN'D IN ANY
I SAW THROUGH HUNGER UBALDINO GRIND
HIS TEETH ON EMPTINESS AND BONIFACE
THAT WAV'D THE CROZIER O'ER A NUM'ROUS FLOCK
I SAW THE MARQUIS WHO TAD TIME EREWHILE
TO SWILL AT FORLI WITH LESS DROUGHT YET SO
WAS ONE NE'ER SATED
I HOWE'ER LIKE HIM
THAT GAZING 'MIDST A CROWD SINGLES OUT ONE
SO SINGLED HIM OF LUCCA FOR METHOUGHT
WAS NONE AMONGST THEM TOOK SUCH NOTE OF ME
SOMEWHAT I HEARD HIM WHISPER OF GENTUCCA
THE SOUND WAS INDISTINCT AND MURMUR'D THERE
WHERE JUSTICE THAT SO STRIPS THEM FIX'D HER STING
SPIRIT SAID I IT SEEMS AS THOU WOULDST FAIN
SPEAK WITH ME
LET ME HEAR THEE
MUTUAL WISH
TO CONVERSE PROMPTS WHICH LET US BOTH INDULGE
HE ANSW'RING STRAIGHT BEGAN WOMAN IS BORN
WHOSE BROW NO WIMPLE SHADES YET THAT SHALL MAKE
MY CITY PLEASE THEE BLAME IT AS THEY MAY
GO THEN WITH THIS FOREWARNING
IF AUGHT FALSE
MY WHISPER TOO IMPLIED TH' EVENT SHALL TELL
BUT SAY IF OF A TRUTH I SEE THE MAN
OF THAT NEW LAY TH' INVENTOR WHICH BEGINS
WITH 'LADIES YE THAT CON THE LORE OF LOVE'
TO WHOM I THUS COUNT OF ME BUT AS ONE
WHO AM THE SCRIBE OF LOVE THAT WHEN HE BREATHES
TAKE UP MY PEN AND AS HE DICTATES WRITE
BROTHER SAID HE THE HIND'RANCE WHICH ONCE HELD
THE NOTARY WITH GUITTONE AND MYSELF
SHORT OF THAT NEW AND SWEETER STYLE I HEAR
IS NOW DISCLOS'D
I SEE HOW YE YOUR PLUMES
STRETCH AS TH' INDITER GUIDES THEM WHICH NO QUESTION
OURS DID NOT
HE THAT SEEKS A GRACE BEYOND
SEES NOT THE DISTANCE PARTS ONE STYLE FROM OTHER
AND AS CONTENTED HERE HE HELD HIS PEACE
LIKE AS THE BIRD THAT WINTER NEAR THE NILE
IN SQUARED REGIMENT DIRECT THEIR COURSE
THEN STRETCH THEMSELVES IN FILE FOR SPEEDIER FLIGHT
THUS ALL THE TRIBE OF SPIRITS AS THEY TURN'D
THEIR VISAGE FASTER DEAF NIMBLE ALIKE
THROUGH LEANNESS AND DESIRE
AND AS A MAN
TIR'D WITH THE MOTION OF A TROTTING STEED
SLACKS PACE AND STAYS BEHIND HIS COMPANY
TILL HIS O'ERBREATHED LUNGS KEEP TEMPERATE TIME
E'EN SO FORESE LET THAT HOLY CREW
PROCEED BEHIND THEM LINGERING AT MY SIDE
AND SAYING WHEN SHALL I AGAIN BEHOLD THEE
HOW LONG MY LIFE MAY LAST SAID I I KNOW NOT
THIS KNOW HOW SOON SOEVER I RETURN
MY WISHES WILL BEFORE ME HAVE ARRIV'D
SITHENCE THE PLACE WHERE I AM SET TO LIVE
IS DAY BY DAY MORE SCOOP'D OF ALL ITS GOOD
AND DISMAL RUIN SEEMS TO THREATEN IT
GO NOW HE CRIED LO HE WHOSE GUILT IS MOST
PASSES BEFORE MY VISION DRAGG'D AT HEELS
OF AN INFURIATE BEAST
TOWARD THE VALE
WHERE GUILT HATH NO REDEMPTION ON IT SPEEDS
EACH STEP INCREASING SWIFTNESS ON THE LAST
UNTIL A BLOW IT STRIKES THAT LEAVETH HIM
A CORSE MOST VILELY SHATTER'D
NO LONG SPACE
THOSE WHEELS HAVE YET TO ROLL THEREWITH HIS EYES
LOOK'D UP TO HEAV'N ERE THOU SHALT PLAINLY SEE
THAT WHICH MY WORDS MAY NOT MORE PLAINLY TELL
I QUIT THEE TIME IS PRECIOUS HERE I LOSE
TOO MUCH THUS MEASURING MY PACE WITH SHINE
AS FROM A TROOP OF WELL RANK'D CHIVALRY
ONE KNIGHT MORE ENTERPRISING THAN THE REST
PRICKS FORTH AT GALLOP EAGER TO DISPLAY
HIS PROWESS IN THE FIRST ENCOUNTER PROV'D
SO PARTED HE FROM US WITH LENGTHEN'D STRIDES
AND LEFT ME ON THE WAY WITH THOSE TWAIN SPIRITS
WHO WERE SUCH MIGHTY MARSHALS OF THE WORLD
WHEN HE BEYOND US HAD SO FLED MINE EYES
NO NEARER REACH'D HIM THAN MY THOUGHT HIS WORDS
THE BRANCHES OF ANOTHER FRUIT THICK HUNG
AND BLOOMING FRESH APPEAR'D
E'EN AS OUR STEPS
TURN'D THITHER NOT FAR OFF IT ROSE TO VIEW
BENEATH IT WERE A MULTITUDE THAT RAIS'D
THEIR HANDS AND SHOUTED FORTH I KNOW NOT WHAT
UNTO THE BOUGHS LIKE GREEDY AND FOND BRATS
THAT BEG AND ANSWER NONE OBTAIN FROM HIM
OF WHOM THEY BEG BUT MORE TO DRAW THEM ON
HE AT ARM'S LENGTH THE OBJECT OF THEIR WISH
ABOVE THEM HOLDS ALOFT AND HIDES IT NOT
AT LENGTH AS UNDECEIV'D THEY WENT THEIR WAY
AND WE APPROACH THE TREE WHO VOWS AND TEARS
SUE TO IN VAIN THE MIGHTY TREE
PASS ON
AND COME NOT NEAR
STANDS HIGHER UP THE WOOD
WHEREOF EVE TASTED AND FROM IT WAS TA'EN
'THIS PLANT SUCH SOUNDS FROM MIDST THE THICKETS CAME
WHENCE I WITH EITHER BARD CLOSE TO THE SIDE
THAT ROSE PASS'D FORTH BEYOND
REMEMBER NEXT
WE HEARD THOSE NOBLEST CREATURES OF THE CLOUDS
HOW THEY THEIR TWOFOLD BOSOMS OVERGORG'D
OPPOS'D IN FIGHT TO THESEUS CALL TO MIND
THE HEBREWS HOW EFFEMINATE THEY STOOP'D
TO EASE THEIR THIRST WHENCE GIDEON'S RANKS WERE THINN'D
AS HE TO MIDIAN MARCH'D ADOWN THE HILLS
THUS NEAR ONE BORDER COASTING STILL WE HEARD
THE SINS OF GLUTTONY WITH WOE EREWHILE
REGUERDON'D
THEN ALONG THE LONELY PATH
ONCE MORE AT LARGE FULL THOUSAND PACES ON
WE TRAVEL'D EACH CONTEMPLATIVE AND MUTE
WHY PENSIVE JOURNEY THUS YE THREE ALONE
THUS SUDDENLY A VOICE EXCLAIM'D WHEREAT
I SHOOK AS DOTH A SCAR'D AND PALTRY BEAST
THEN RAIS'D MY HEAD TO LOOK FROM WHENCE IT CAME
WAS NE'ER IN FURNACE GLASS OR METAL SEEN
SO BRIGHT AND GLOWING RED AS WAS THE SHAPE
I NOW BEHELD
IF YE DESIRE TO MOUNT
HE CRIED HERE MUST YE TURN
THIS WAY HE GOES
WHO GOES IN QUEST OF PEACE HIS COUNTENANCE
HAD DAZZLED ME AND TO MY GUIDES I FAC'D
BACKWARD LIKE ONE WHO WALKS AS SOUND DIRECTS
AS WHEN TO HARBINGER THE DAWN SPRINGS UP
ON FRESHEN'D WING THE AIR OF MAY AND BREATHES
OF FRAGRANCE ALL IMPREGN'D WITH HERB AND FLOWERS
E'EN SUCH A WIND I FELT UPON MY FRONT
BLOW GENTLY AND THE MOVING OF A WING
PERCEIV'D THAT MOVING SHED AMBROSIAL SMELL
AND THEN A VOICE BLESSED ARE THEY WHOM GRACE
DOTH SO ILLUME THAT APPETITE IN THEM
EXHALETH NO INORDINATE DESIRE
STILL HUNG'RING AS THE RULE OF TEMPERANCE WILLS
CANTO XXV
IT WAS AN HOUR WHEN HE WHO CLIMBS HAD NEED
TO WALK UNCRIPPLED FOR THE SUN HAD NOW
TO TAURUS THE MERIDIAN CIRCLE LEFT
AND TO THE SCORPION LEFT THE NIGHT
AS ONE
THAT MAKES NO PAUSE BUT PRESSES ON HIS ROAD
WHATE'ER BETIDE HIM IF SOME URGENT NEED
IMPEL SO ENTER'D WE UPON OUR WAY
ONE BEFORE OTHER FOR BUT SINGLY NONE
THAT STEEP AND NARROW SCALE ADMITS TO CLIMB
E'EN AS THE YOUNG STORK LIFTETH UP HIS WING
THROUGH WISH TO FLY YET VENTURES NOT TO QUIT
THE NEST AND DROPS IT SO IN ME DESIRE
OF QUESTIONING MY GUIDE AROSE AND FELL
ARRIVING EVEN TO THE ACT THAT MARKS
A MAN PREPAR'D FOR SPEECH
HIM ALL OUR HASTE
RESTRAIN'D NOT BUT THUS SPAKE THE SIRE BELOV'D
FEAR NOT TO SPEED THE SHAFT THAT ON THY LIP
STANDS TREMBLING FOR ITS FLIGHT
ENCOURAG'D THUS
I STRAIGHT BEGAN HOW THERE CAN LEANNESS COME
WHERE IS NO WANT OF NOURISHMENT TO FEED
IF THOU HE ANSWER'D HADST REMEMBER'D THEE
HOW MELEAGER WITH THE WASTING BRAND
WASTED ALIKE BY EQUAL FIRES CONSUM'D
THIS WOULD NOT TROUBLE THEE AND HADST THOU THOUGHT
HOW IN THE MIRROR YOUR REFLECTED FORM
WITH MIMIC MOTION VIBRATES WHAT NOW SEEMS
HARD HAD APPEAR'D NO HARDER THAN THE PULP
OF SUMMER FRUIT MATURE
BUT THAT THY WILL
IN CERTAINTY MAY FIND ITS FULL REPOSE
LO STATIUS HERE ON HIM I CALL AND PRAY
THAT HE WOULD NOW BE HEALER OF THY WOUND
IF IN THY PRESENCE I UNFOLD TO HIM
THE SECRETS OF HEAVEN'S VENGEANCE LET ME PLEAD
THINE OWN INJUNCTION TO EXCULPATE ME
SO STATIUS ANSWER'D AND FORTHWITH BEGAN
ATTEND MY WORDS O SON AND IN THY MIND
RECEIVE THEM SO SHALL THEY BE LIGHT TO CLEAR
THE DOUBT THOU OFFER'ST
BLOOD CONCOCTED WELL
WHICH BY THE THIRSTY VEINS IS NE'ER IMBIB'D
AND RESTS AS FOOD SUPERFLUOUS TO BE TA'EN
FROM THE REPLENISH'D TABLE IN THE HEART
DERIVES EFFECTUAL VIRTUE THAT INFORMS
THE SEVERAL HUMAN LIMBS AS BEING THAT
WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE VEINS ITSELF TO MAKE THEM
YET MORE CONCOCTED IT DESCENDS WHERE SHAME
FORBIDS TO MENTION AND FROM THENCE DISTILS
IN NATURAL VESSEL ON ANOTHER'S BLOOD
THEN EACH UNITE TOGETHER ONE DISPOS'D
T' ENDURE TO ACT THE OTHER THROUGH MEET FRAME
OF ITS RECIPIENT MOULD THAT BEING REACH'D
IT 'GINS TO WORK COAGULATING FIRST
THEN VIVIFIES WHAT ITS OWN SUBSTANCE CAUS'D
TO BEAR
WITH ANIMATION NOW INDUED
THE ACTIVE VIRTUE DIFFERING FROM A PLANT
NO FURTHER THAN THAT THIS IS ON THE WAY
AND AT ITS LIMIT THAT CONTINUES YET
TO OPERATE THAT NOW IT MOVES AND FEELS
AS SEA SPONGE CLINGING TO THE ROCK AND THERE
ASSUMES TH' ORGANIC POWERS ITS SEED CONVEY'D
'THIS IS THE PERIOD SON AT WHICH THE VIRTUE
THAT FROM THE GENERATING HEART PROCEEDS
IS PLIANT AND EXPANSIVE FOR EACH LIMB
IS IN THE HEART BY FORGEFUL NATURE PLANN'D
HOW BABE OF ANIMAL BECOMES REMAINS
FOR THY CONSID'RING
AT THIS POINT MORE WISE
THAN THOU HAST ERR'D MAKING THE SOUL DISJOIN'D
FROM PASSIVE INTELLECT BECAUSE HE SAW
NO ORGAN FOR THE LATTER'S USE ASSIGN'D
OPEN THY BOSOM TO THE TRUTH THAT COMES
KNOW SOON AS IN THE EMBRYO TO THE BRAIN
ARTICULATION IS COMPLETE THEN TURNS
THE PRIMAL MOVER WITH A SMILE OF JOY
ON SUCH GREAT WORK OF NATURE AND IMBREATHES
NEW SPIRIT REPLETE WITH VIRTUE THAT WHAT HERE
ACTIVE IT FINDS TO ITS OWN SUBSTANCE DRAWS
AND FORMS AN INDIVIDUAL SOUL THAT LIVES
AND FEELS AND BENDS REFLECTIVE ON ITSELF
AND THAT THOU LESS MAYST MARVEL AT THE WORD
MARK THE SUN'S HEAT HOW THAT TO WINE DOTH CHANGE
MIX'D WITH THE MOISTURE FILTER'D THROUGH THE VINE
WHEN LACHESIS HATH SPUN THE THREAD THE SOUL
TAKES WITH HER BOTH THE HUMAN AND DIVINE
MEMORY INTELLIGENCE AND WILL IN ACT
FAR KEENER THAN BEFORE THE OTHER POWERS
INACTIVE ALL AND MUTE
NO PAUSE ALLOW'D
IN WOND'ROUS SORT SELF MOVING TO ONE STRAND
OF THOSE WHERE THE DEPARTED ROAM SHE FALLS
HERE LEARNS HER DESTIN'D PATH
SOON AS THE PLACE
RECEIVES HER ROUND THE PLASTIC VIRTUE BEAMS
DISTINCT AS IN THE LIVING LIMBS BEFORE
AND AS THE AIR WHEN SATURATE WITH SHOWERS
THE CASUAL BEAM REFRACTING DECKS ITSELF
WITH MANY A HUE SO HERE THE AMBIENT AIR
WEARETH THAT FORM WHICH INFLUENCE OF THE SOUL
IMPRINTS ON IT AND LIKE THE FLAME THAT WHERE
THE FIRE MOVES THITHER FOLLOWS SO HENCEFORTH
THE NEW FORM ON THE SPIRIT FOLLOWS STILL
HENCE HATH IT SEMBLANCE AND IS SHADOW CALL'D
WITH EACH SENSE EVEN TO THE SIGHT ENDUED
HENCE SPEECH IS OURS HENCE LAUGHTER TEARS AND SIGHS
WHICH THOU MAYST OFT HAVE WITNESS'D ON THE MOUNT
TH' OBEDIENT SHADOW FAILS NOT TO PRESENT
WHATEVER VARYING PASSION MOVES WITHIN US
AND THIS THE CAUSE OF WHAT THOU MARVEL'ST AT
NOW THE LAST FLEXURE OF OUR WAY WE REACH'D
AND TO THE RIGHT HAND TURNING OTHER CARE
AWAITS US
HERE THE ROCKY PRECIPICE
HURLS FORTH REDUNDANT FLAMES AND FROM THE RIM
A BLAST UPBLOWN WITH FORCIBLE REBUFF
DRIVETH THEM BACK SEQUESTER'D FROM ITS BOUND
BEHOOV'D US ONE BY ONE ALONG THE SIDE
THAT BORDER'D ON THE VOID TO PASS AND I
FEAR'D ON ONE HAND THE FIRE ON TH' OTHER FEAR'D
HEADLONG TO FALL WHEN THUS TH' INSTRUCTOR WARN'D
STRICT REIN MUST IN THIS PLACE DIRECT THE EYES
A LITTLE SWERVING AND THE WAY IS LOST
THEN FROM THE BOSOM OF THE BURNING MASS
O GOD OF MERCY HEARD I SUNG AND FELT
NO LESS DESIRE TO TURN
AND WHEN I SAW
SPIRITS ALONG THE FLAME PROCEEDING I
BETWEEN THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND MINE OWN WAS FAIN
TO SHARE BY TURNS MY VIEW
AT THE HYMN'S CLOSE
THEY SHOUTED LOUD I DO NOT KNOW A MAN
THEN IN LOW VOICE AGAIN TOOK UP THE STRAIN
WHICH ONCE MORE ENDED TO THE WOOD THEY CRIED
RAN DIAN AND DRAVE FORTH CALLISTO STUNG
WITH CYTHEREA'S POISON THEN RETURN'D
UNTO THEIR SONG THEN MARRY A PAIR EXTOLL'D
WHO LIV'D IN VIRTUE CHASTELY AND THE BANDS
OF WEDDED LOVE
NOR FROM THAT TASK I WEEN
SURCEASE THEY WHILESOE'ER THE SCORCHING FIRE
ENCLASPS THEM
OF SUCH SKILL APPLIANCE NEEDS
TO MEDICINE THE WOUND THAT HEALETH LAST
CANTO XXVI
WHILE SINGLY THUS ALONG THE RIM WE WALK'D
OFT THE GOOD MASTER WARN'D ME LOOK THOU WELL
AVAIL IT THAT I CAUTION THEE THE SUN
NOW ALL THE WESTERN CLIME IRRADIATE CHANG'D
FROM AZURE TINCT TO WHITE AND AS I PASS'D
MY PASSING SHADOW MADE THE UMBER'D FLAME
BURN RUDDIER
AT SO STRANGE A SIGHT I MARK'D
THAT MANY A SPIRIT MARVEL'D ON HIS WAY
THIS BRED OCCASION FIRST TO SPEAK OF ME
HE SEEMS SAID THEY NO INSUBSTANTIAL FRAME
THEN TO OBTAIN WHAT CERTAINTY THEY MIGHT
STRETCH'D TOWARDS ME CAREFUL NOT TO OVERPASS
THE BURNING PALE
O THOU WHO FOLLOWEST
THE OTHERS HAPLY NOT MORE SLOW THAN THEY
BUT MOV'D BY REV'RENCE ANSWER ME WHO BURN
IN THIRST AND FIRE NOR I ALONE BUT THESE
ALL FOR THINE ANSWER DO MORE THIRST THAN DOTH
INDIAN OR AETHIOP FOR THE COOLING STREAM
TELL US HOW IS IT THAT THOU MAK'ST THYSELF
A WALL AGAINST THE SUN AS THOU NOT YET
INTO TH' INEXTRICABLE TOILS OF DEATH
HADST ENTER'D THUS SPAKE ONE AND I HAD STRAIGHT
DECLAR'D ME IF ATTENTION HAD NOT TURN'D
TO NEW APPEARANCE
MEETING THESE THERE CAME
MIDWAY THE BURNING PATH A CROWD ON WHOM
EARNESTLY GAZING FROM EACH PART I VIEW
THE SHADOWS ALL PRESS FORWARD SEV'RALLY
EACH SNATCH A HASTY KISS AND THEN AWAY
E'EN SO THE EMMETS 'MID THEIR DUSKY TROOPS
PEER CLOSELY ONE AT OTHER TO SPY OUT
THEIR MUTUAL ROAD PERCHANCE AND HOW THEY THRIVE
THAT FRIENDLY GREETING PARTED ERE DISPATCH
OF THE FIRST ONWARD STEP FROM EITHER TRIBE
LOUD CLAMOUR RISES THOSE WHO NEWLY COME
SHOUT SODOM AND GOMORRAH THESE THE COW
PASIPHAE ENTER'D THAT THE BEAST SHE WOO'D
MIGHT RUSH UNTO HER LUXURY THEN AS CRANES
THAT PART TOWARDS THE RIPHAEAN MOUNTAINS FLY
PART TOWARDS THE LYBIC SANDS THESE TO AVOID
THE ICE AND THOSE THE SUN SO HASTETH OFF
ONE CROWD ADVANCES TH' OTHER AND RESUME
THEIR FIRST SONG WEEPING AND THEIR SEVERAL SHOUT
AGAIN DREW NEAR MY SIDE THE VERY SAME
WHO HAD EREWHILE BESOUGHT ME AND THEIR LOOKS
MARK'D EAGERNESS TO LISTEN
I WHO TWICE
THEIR WILL HAD NOTED SPAKE O SPIRITS SECURE
WHENE'ER THE TIME MAY BE OF PEACEFUL END
MY LIMBS NOR CRUDE NOR IN MATURE OLD AGE
HAVE I LEFT YONDER HERE THEY BEAR ME FED
WITH BLOOD AND SINEW STRUNG
THAT I NO MORE
MAY LIVE IN BLINDNESS HENCE I TEND ALOFT
THERE IS A DAME ON HIGH WHO WIND FOR US
THIS GRACE BY WHICH MY MORTAL THROUGH YOUR REALM

BUT MAY YOUR UTMOST WISH SOON MEET
SUCH FULL FRUITION THAT THE ORB OF HEAVEN
FULLEST OF LOVE AND OF MOST AMPLE SPACE
RECEIVE YOU AS YE TELL UPON MY PAGE
HENCEFORTH TO STAND RECORDED WHO YE ARE
AND WHAT THIS MULTITUDE THAT AT YOUR BACKS
HAVE PAST BEHIND US AS ONE MOUNTAIN BRED
RUGGED AND CLOWNISH IF SOME CITY'S WALLS
HE CHANCE TO ENTER ROUND HIM STARES AGAPE
CONFOUNDED AND STRUCK DUMB E'EN SUCH APPEAR'D
EACH SPIRIT
BUT WHEN RID OF THAT AMAZE
NOT LONG THE INMATE OF A NOBLE HEART
HE WHO BEFORE HAD QUESTION'D THUS RESUM'D
O BLESSED WHO FOR DEATH PREPARING TAK'ST
EXPERIENCE OF OUR LIMITS IN THY BARK
THEIR CRIME WHO NOT WITH US PROCEED WAS THAT
FOR WHICH AS HE DID TRIUMPH CAESAR HEARD
THE SNOUT OF 'QUEEN TO TAUNT HIM
HENCE THEIR CRY
OF 'SODOM AS THEY PARTED TO REBUKE
THEMSELVES AND AID THE BURNING BY THEIR SHAME
OUR SINNING WAS HERMAPHRODITE BUT WE
BECAUSE THE LAW OF HUMAN KIND WE BROKE
FOLLOWING LIKE BEASTS OUR VILE CONCUPISCENCE
HENCE PARTING FROM THEM TO OUR OWN DISGRACE
RECORD THE NAME OF HER BY WHOM THE BEAST
IN BESTIAL TIRE WAS ACTED
NOW OUR DEEDS
THOU KNOW'ST AND HOW WE SINN'D
IF THOU BY NAME
WOULDST HAPLY KNOW US TIME PERMITS NOT NOW
TO TELL SO MUCH NOR CAN I
OF MYSELF
LEARN WHAT THOU WISHEST
GUINICELLI I
WHO HAVING TRULY SORROW'D ERE MY LAST
ALREADY CLEANSE ME WITH SUCH PIOUS JOY
AS THE TWO SONS UPON THEIR MOTHER GAZ'D
FROM SAD LYCURGUS RESCU'D SUCH MY JOY
SAVE THAT I MORE REPREST IT WHEN I HEARD
FROM HIS OWN LIPS THE NAME OF HIM PRONOUNC'D
WHO WAS A FATHER TO ME AND TO THOSE
MY BETTERS WHO HAVE EVER US'D THE SWEET
AND PLEASANT RHYMES OF LOVE
SO NOUGHT I HEARD
NOR SPAKE BUT LONG TIME THOUGHTFULLY I WENT
GAZING ON HIM AND ONLY FOR THE FIRE
APPROACH'D NOT NEARER
WHEN MY EYES WERE FED
BY LOOKING ON HIM WITH SUCH SOLEMN PLEDGE
AS FORCES CREDENCE I DEVOTED ME
UNTO HIS SERVICE WHOLLY
IN REPLY
HE THUS BESPAKE ME WHAT FROM THEE I HEAR
IS GRAV'D SO DEEPLY ON MY MIND THE WAVES
OF LETHE SHALL NOT WASH IT OFF NOR MAKE
A WHIT LESS LIVELY
BUT AS NOW THY OATH
HAS SEAL'D THE TRUTH DECLARE WHAT CAUSE IMPELS
THAT LOVE WHICH BOTH THY LOOKS AND SPEECH BEWRAY
THOSE DULCET LAYS I ANSWER'D WHICH AS LONG
AS OF OUR TONGUE THE BEAUTY DOES NOT FADE
SHALL MAKE US LOVE THE VERY INK THAT TRAC'D THEM
BROTHER HE CRIED AND POINTED AT A SHADE
BEFORE HIM THERE IS ONE WHOSE MOTHER SPEECH
DOTH OWE TO HIM A FAIRER ORNAMENT
HE IN LOVE DITTIES AND THE TALES OF PROSE
WITHOUT A RIVAL STANDS AND LETS THE FOOLS
TALK ON WHO THINK THE SONGSTER OF LIMOGES
O'ERTOPS HIM
RUMOUR AND THE POPULAR VOICE
THEY LOOK TO MORE THAN TRUTH AND SO CONFIRM
OPINION ERE BY ART OR REASON TAUGHT
THUS MANY OF THE ELDER TIME CRIED UP
GUITTONE GIVING HIM THE PRIZE TILL TRUTH
BY STRENGTH OF NUMBERS VANQUISH'D
IF THOU OWN
SO AMPLE PRIVILEGE AS TO HAVE GAIN'D
FREE ENTRANCE TO THE CLOISTER WHEREOF CHRIST
IS ABBOT OF THE COLLEGE SAY TO HIM
ONE PATERNOSTER FOR ME FAR AS NEEDS
FOR DWELLERS IN THIS WORLD WHERE POWER TO SIN
NO LONGER TEMPTS US HAPLY TO MAKE WAY
FOR ONE THAT FOLLOW'D NEXT WHEN THAT WAS SAID
HE VANISH'D THROUGH THE FIRE AS THROUGH THE WAVE
A FISH THAT GLANCES DIVING TO THE DEEP
I TO THE SPIRIT HE HAD SHOWN ME DREW
A LITTLE ONWARD AND BESOUGHT HIS NAME
FOR WHICH MY HEART I SAID KEPT GRACIOUS ROOM
HE FRANKLY THUS BEGAN THY COURTESY
SO WINS ON ME I HAVE NOR POWER NOR WILL
TO HIDE ME
I AM ARNAULT AND WITH SONGS
SORELY LAMENTING FOR MY FOLLY PAST
THOROUGH THIS FORD OF FIRE I WADE AND SEE
THE DAY I HOPE FOR SMILING IN MY VIEW
I PRAY YE BY THE WORTH THAT GUIDES YE UP
UNTO THE SUMMIT OF THE SCALE IN TIME
REMEMBER YE MY SUFF'RINGS WITH SUCH WORDS
HE DISAPPEAR'D IN THE REFINING FLAME
CANTO XXVII
NOW WAS THE SUN SO STATION'D AS WHEN FIRST
HIS EARLY RADIANCE QUIVERS ON THE HEIGHTS
WHERE STREAM'D HIS MAKER'S BLOOD WHILE LIBRA HANGS
ABOVE HESPERIAN EBRO AND NEW FIRES
MERIDIAN FLASH ON GANGES' YELLOW TIDE
SO DAY WAS SINKING WHEN THE' ANGEL OF GOD
APPEAR'D BEFORE US
JOY WAS IN HIS MIEN
FORTH OF THE FLAME HE STOOD UPON THE BRINK
AND WITH A VOICE WHOSE LIVELY CLEARNESS FAR
SURPASS'D OUR HUMAN BLESSED ARE THE PURE
IN HEART HE SANG THEN NEAR HIM AS WE CAME
GO YE NOT FURTHER HOLY SPIRITS HE CRIED
ERE THE FIRE PIERCE YOU ENTER IN AND LIST
ATTENTIVE TO THE SONG YE HEAR FROM THENCE

SOMEWHAT DISTURB'D HE CRIED MARK NOW MY SON
FROM BEATRICE THOU ART BY THIS WALL
DIVIDED AS AT THISBE'S NAME THE EYE
OF PYRAMUS WAS OPEN'D WHEN LIFE EBB'D
FAST FROM HIS VEINS AND TOOK ONE PARTING GLANCE
WHILE VERMEIL DYED THE MULBERRY THUS I TURN'D
TO MY SAGE GUIDE RELENTING WHEN I HEARD
THE NAME THAT SPRINGS FOREVER IN MY BREAST
HE SHOOK HIS FOREHEAD AND HOW LONG HE SAID
LINGER WE NOW THEN SMIL'D AS ONE WOULD SMILE
UPON A CHILD THAT EYES THE FRUIT AND YIELDS
INTO THE FIRE BEFORE ME THEN HE WALK'D
AND STATIUS WHO EREWHILE NO LITTLE SPACE
HAD PARTED US HE PRAY'D TO COME BEHIND
I WOULD HAVE CAST ME INTO MOLTEN GLASS
TO COOL ME WHEN I ENTER'D SO INTENSE
RAG'D THE CONFLAGRANT MASS
THE SIRE BELOV'D
TO COMFORT ME AS HE PROCEEDED STILL
OF BEATRICE TALK'D
HER EYES SAITH HE

A VOICE THAT SANG DID GUIDE US AND THE VOICE
FOLLOWING WITH HEEDFUL EAR WE ISSUED FORTH

UPRIGHT WITHIN THE ROCK AROSE AND FAC'D
SUCH PART OF HEAV'N THAT FROM BEFORE MY STEPS

OF DARKNESS O'ER ITS MEASURELESS EXPANSE
INVOLV'D TH' HORIZON AND THE NIGHT HER LOT

FORBIDDEN FURTHER TRAVEL

UPON THE CRAGGY CLIFFS ERE THEY HAD TA'EN
THEIR SUPPER ON THE HERB NOW SILENT LIE

A LITTLE GLIMPSE OF SKY WAS SEEN ABOVE

IN MAGNITUDE AND RUSTLE SHINING FORTH
WITH MORE THAN WONTED GLORY
AS I LAY
GAZING ON THEM AND IN THAT FIT OF MUSING
SLEEP OVERCAME ME SLEEP THAT BRINGETH OFT
TIDINGS OF FUTURE HAP
ABOUT THE HOUR
AS I BELIEVE WHEN VENUS FROM THE EAST
FIRST LIGHTEN'D ON THE MOUNTAIN SHE WHOSE ORB
SEEMS ALWAYS GLOWING WITH THE FIRE OF LOVE
A LADY YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL I DREAM'D
WAS PASSING O'ER A LEA AND AS SHE CAME
METHOUGHT I SAW HER EVER AND ANON

WITH LIVELY GREENNESS THE NEW SPRINGING DAY
ATTEMPER'D EAGER NOW TO ROAM AND SEARCH
ITS LIMITS ROUND FORTHWITH I LEFT THE BANK
ALONG THE CHAMPAIN LEISURELY MY WAY
PURSUING O'ER THE GROUND THAT ON ALL SIDES
DELICIOUS ODOUR BREATH'D
A PLEASANT AIR
THAT INTERMITTED NEVER NEVER VEER'D
SMOTE ON MY TEMPLES GENTLY AS A WIND
OF SOFTEST INFLUENCE AT WHICH THE SPRAYS
OBEDIENT ALL LEAN'D TREMBLING TO THAT PART
WHERE FIRST THE HOLY MOUNTAIN CASTS HIS SHADE

UPON THEIR TOP THE FEATHER'D QUIRISTERS
APPLIED THEIR WONTED ART AND WITH FULL JOY
WELCOM'D THOSE HOURS OF PRIME AND WARBLED SHRILL
AMID THE LEAVES THAT TO THEIR JOCUND LAYS
INEPT TENOR EVEN AS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
ALONG THE PINEY FORESTS ON THE SHORE
OF CHIASSI ROLLS THE GATH'RING MELODY
WHEN EOLUS HATH FROM HIS CAVERN LOOS'D
THE DRIPPING SOUTH
ALREADY HAD MY STEPS
THOUGH SLOW SO FAR INTO THAT ANCIENT WOOD
TRANSPORTED ME I COULD NOT KEN THE PLACE
WHERE I HAD ENTER'D WHEN BEHOLD MY PATH
WAS BOUNDED BY A RILL WHICH TO THE LEFT
WITH LITTLE RIPPLING WATERS BENT THE GRASS
THAT ISSUED FROM ITS BRINK
ON EARTH NO WAVE
HOW CLEAN SOE'ER THAT WOULD NOT SEEM TO HAVE
SOME MIXTURE IN ITSELF COMPAR'D WITH THIS
TRANSPICUOUS CLEAR YET DARKLY ON IT ROLL'D
DARKLY BENEATH PERPETUAL GLOOM WHICH NE'ER
ADMITS OR SUN OR MOON LIGHT THERE TO SHINE
MY FEET ADVANC'D NOT BUT MY WOND'RING EYES
PASS'D ONWARD O'ER THE STREAMLET TO SURVEY
THE TENDER MAY BLOOM FLUSH'D THROUGH MANY A HUE
IN PRODIGAL VARIETY AND THERE
AS OBJECT RISING SUDDENLY TO VIEW
THAT FROM OUR BOSOM EVERY THOUGHT BESIDE
WITH THE RARE MARVEL CHASES I BEHELD
A LADY ALL ALONE WHO SINGING WENT
AND CULLING FLOWER FROM FLOWER WHEREWITH HER WAY
WAS ALL O'ER PAINTED
LADY BEAUTIFUL
THOU WHO IF LOOKS THAT USE TO SPEAK THE HEART
ARE WORTHY OF OUR TRUST WITH LOVE'S OWN BEAM
DOST WARM THEE THUS TO HER MY SPEECH I FRAM'D
AH PLEASE THEE HITHER TOWARDS THE STREAMLET BEND
THY STEPS SO NEAR THAT I MAY LIST THY SONG
BEHOLDING THEE AND THIS FAIR PLACE METHINKS
I CALL TO MIND WHERE WANDER'D AND HOW LOOK'D
PROSERPINE IN THAT SEASON WHEN HER CHILD
THE MOTHER LOST AND SHE THE BLOOMY SPRING
AS WHEN A LADY TURNING IN THE DANCE
DOTH FOOT IT FEATLY AND ADVANCES SCARCE
ONE STEP BEFORE THE OTHER TO THE GROUND
OVER THE YELLOW AND VERMILION FLOWERS
THUS TURN'D SHE AT MY SUIT MOST MAIDEN LIKE
VALING HER SOBER EYES AND CAME SO NEAR
THAT I DISTINCTLY CAUGHT THE DULCET SOUND
ARRIVING WHERE THE LIMPED WATERS NOW
LAV'D THE GREEN SWARD HER EYES SHE DEIGN'D TO RAISE
THAT SHOT SUCH SPLENDOUR ON ME AS I WEEN
NE'ER GLANCED FROM CYTHEREA'S WHEN HER SON
HAD SPED HIS KEENEST WEAPON TO HER HEART
UPON THE OPPOSITE BANK SHE STOOD AND SMIL'D
THROUGH HER GRACEFUL FINGERS SHIFTED STILL
THE INTERMINGLING DYES WHICH WITHOUT SEED
THAT LOFTY LAND UNBOSOMS
BY THE STREAM
THREE PACES ONLY WERE WE SUNDER'D YET
THE HELLESPONT WHERE XERXES PASS'D IT O'ER
A CURB FOR EVER TO THE PRIDE OF MAN
WAS BY LEANDER NOT MORE HATEFUL HELD
FOR FLOATING WITH INHOSPITABLE WAVE
'TWIXT SESTUS AND ABYDOS THAN BY ME
THAT FLOOD BECAUSE IT GAVE NO PASSAGE THENCE
STRANGERS YE COME AND HAPLY IN THIS PLACE
THAT CRADLED HUMAN NATURE IN ITS BIRTH
WOND'RING YE NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION VIEW
MY SMILES BUT THAT SWEET STRAIN OF PSALMODY
'THOU LORD HAST MADE ME GLAD WILL GIVE YE LIGHT
WHICH MAY UNCLOUD YOUR MINDS
AND THOU WHO STAND'ST
THE FOREMOST AND DIDST MAKE THY SUIT TO ME
SAY IF AUGHT ELSE THOU WISH TO HEAR FOR I
CAME PROMPT TO ANSWER EVERY DOUBT OF THINE
SHE SPAKE AND I REPLIED I KNOW NOT HOW
TO RECONCILE THIS WAVE AND RUSTLING SOUND
OF FOREST LEAVES WITH WHAT I LATE HAVE HEARD
OF OPPOSITE REPORT SHE ANSWERING THUS
I WILL UNFOLD THE CAUSE WHENCE THAT PROCEEDS
WHICH MAKES THEE WONDER AND SO PURGE THE CLOUD
THAT HATH ENWRAPS THEE
THE FIRST GOOD WHOSE JOY
IS ONLY IN HIMSELF CREATED MAN
FOR HAPPINESS AND GAVE THIS GOODLY PLACE
HIS PLEDGE AND EARNEST OF ETERNAL PEACE
FAVOUR'D THUS HIGHLY THROUGH HIS OWN DEFECT
HE FELL AND HERE MADE SHORT SOJOURN HE FELL
AND FOR THE BITTERNESS OF SORROW CHANG'D
LAUGHTER UNBLAM'D AND EVER NEW DELIGHT
THAT VAPOURS NONE EXHAL'D FROM EARTH BENEATH
OR FROM THE WATERS WHICH WHEREVER HEAT
ATTRACTS THEM FOLLOW MIGHT ASCEND THUS FAR
TO VEX MAN'S PEACEFUL STATE THIS MOUNTAIN ROSE
SO HIGH TOWARD THE HEAV'N NOR FEARS THE RAGE
OF ELEMENTS CONTENDING FROM THAT PART
EXEMPTED WHERE THE GATE HIS LIMIT BARS
BECAUSE THE CIRCUMAMBIENT AIR THROUGHOUT
WITH ITS FIRST IMPULSE CIRCLES STILL UNLESS
AUGHT INTERPOSE TO CHEEK OR THWART ITS COURSE
UPON THE SUMMIT WHICH ON EVERY SIDE
TO VISITATION OF TH' IMPASSIVE AIR
IS OPEN DOTH THAT MOTION STRIKE AND MAKES
BENEATH ITS SWAY TH' UMBRAGEOUS WOOD RESOUND
AND IN THE SHAKEN PLANT SUCH POWER RESIDES
THAT IT IMPREGNATES WITH ITS EFFICACY
THE VOYAGING BREEZE UPON WHOSE SUBTLE PLUME
THAT WAFTED FLIES ABROAD AND TH' OTHER LAND
RECEIVING AS 'T IS WORTHY IN ITSELF
OR IN THE CLIME THAT WARMS IT DOTH CONCEIVE
AND FROM ITS WOMB PRODUCES MANY A TREE
OF VARIOUS VIRTUE
THIS WHEN THOU HAST HEARD
THE MARVEL CEASES IF IN YONDER EARTH
SOME PLANT WITHOUT APPARENT SEED BE FOUND
TO FIX ITS FIBROUS STEM
AND FURTHER LEARN
THAT WITH PROLIFIC FOISON OF ALL SEEDS
THIS HOLY PLAIN IS FILL'D AND IN ITSELF
BEARS FRUIT THAT NE'ER WAS PLUCK'D ON OTHER SOIL
THE WATER THOU BEHOLD'ST SPRINGS NOT FROM VEIN
AS STREAM THAT INTERMITTENTLY REPAIRS
AND SPENDS HIS PULSE OF LIFE BUT ISSUES FORTH
FROM FOUNTAIN SOLID UNDECAYING SURE
AND BY THE WILL OMNIFIC FULL SUPPLY
FEEDS WHATSOE'ER ON EITHER SIDE IT POURS
ON THIS DEVOLV'D WITH POWER TO TAKE AWAY
REMEMBRANCE OF OFFENCE ON THAT TO BRING
REMEMBRANCE BACK OF EVERY GOOD DEED DONE
FROM WHENCE ITS NAME OF LETHE ON THIS PART
ON TH' OTHER EUNOE BOTH OF WHICH MUST FIRST
BE TASTED ERE IT WORK THE LAST EXCEEDING
ALL FLAVOURS ELSE
ALBEIT THY THIRST MAY NOW
BE WELL CONTENTED IF I HERE BREAK OFF
NO MORE REVEALING YET A COROLLARY
I FREELY GIVE BESIDE NOR DEEM MY WORDS
LESS GRATEFUL TO THEE IF THEY SOMEWHAT PASS
THE STRETCH OF PROMISE
THEY WHOSE VERSE OF YORE
THE GOLDEN AGE RECORDED AND ITS BLISS
ON THE PARNASSIAN MOUNTAIN OF THIS PLACE
PERHAPS HAD DREAM'D
HERE WAS MAN GUILTLESS HERE
PERPETUAL SPRING AND EVERY FRUIT AND THIS
THE FAR FAM'D NECTAR TURNING TO THE BARDS
WHEN SHE HAD CEAS'D I NOTED IN THEIR LOOKS
A SMILE AT HER CONCLUSION THEN MY FACE
AGAIN DIRECTED TO THE LOVELY DAME
CANTO XXIX
SINGING AS IF ENAMOUR'D SHE RESUM'D
AND CLOS'D THE SONG WITH BLESSED THEY WHOSE SINS
ARE COVER'D LIKE THE WOOD NYMPHS THEN THAT TRIPP'D
SINGLY ACROSS THE SYLVAN SHADOWS ONE
EAGER TO VIEW AND ONE TO 'SCAPE THE SUN
SO MOV'D SHE ON AGAINST THE CURRENT UP
THE VERDANT RIVAGE
I HER MINCING STEP
OBSERVING WITH AS TARDY STEP PURSUED
BETWEEN US NOT AN HUNDRED PACES TROD
THE BANK ON EACH SIDE BENDING EQUALLY
GAVE ME TO FACE THE ORIENT
NOR OUR WAY
FAR ONWARD BROUGHT US WHEN TO ME AT ONCE
SHE TURN'D AND CRIED MY BROTHER LOOK AND HEARKEN
AND LO A SUDDEN LUSTRE RAN ACROSS
THROUGH THE GREAT FOREST ON ALL PARTS SO BRIGHT
I DOUBTED WHETHER LIGHTNING WERE ABROAD
BUT THAT EXPIRING EVER IN THE SPLEEN
THAT DOTH UNFOLD IT AND THIS DURING STILL
AND WAXING STILL IN SPLENDOR MADE ME QUESTION
WHAT IT MIGHT BE AND A SWEET MELODY
RAN THROUGH THE LUMINOUS AIR
THEN DID I CHIDE
WITH WARRANTABLE ZEAL THE HARDIHOOD
OF OUR FIRST PARENT FOR THAT THERE WERE EARTH
STOOD IN OBEDIENCE TO THE HEAV'NS SHE ONLY
WOMAN THE CREATURE OF AN HOUR ENDUR'D NOT
RESTRAINT OF ANY VEIL WHICH HAD SHE BORNE
DEVOUTLY JOYS INEFFABLE AS THESE
HAD FROM THE FIRST AND LONG TIME SINCE BEEN MINE
WHILE THROUGH THAT WILDERNESS OF PRIMY SWEETS
THAT NEVER FADE SUSPENSE I WALK'D AND YET
EXPECTANT OF BEATITUDE MORE HIGH
BEFORE US LIKE A BLAZING FIRE THE AIR
UNDER THE GREEN BOUGHS GLOW'D AND FOR A SONG
DISTINCT THE SOUND OF MELODY WAS HEARD
O YE THRICE HOLY VIRGINS FOR YOUR SAKES
IF E'ER I SUFFER'D HUNGER COLD AND WATCHING
OCCASION CALLS ON ME TO CRAVE YOUR BOUNTY
NOW THROUGH MY BREAST LET HELICON HIS STREAM
POUR COPIOUS AND URANIA WITH HER CHOIR
ARISE TO AID ME WHILE THE VERSE UNFOLDS
THINGS THAT DO ALMOST MOCK THE GRASP OF THOUGHT
ONWARD A SPACE WHAT SEEM'D SEVEN TREES OF GOLD
THE INTERVENING DISTANCE TO MINE EYE
FALSELY PRESENTED BUT WHEN I WAS COME
SO NEAR THEM THAT NO LINEAMENT WAS LOST
OF THOSE WITH WHICH A DOUBTFUL OBJECT SEEN
REMOTELY PLAYS ON THE MISDEEMING SENSE
THEN DID THE FACULTY THAT MINISTERS
DISCOURSE TO REASON THESE FOR TAPERS OF GOLD
DISTINGUISH AND IT TH' SINGING TRACE THE SOUND
HOSANNA ABOVE THEIR BEAUTEOUS GARNITURE
FLAM'D WITH MORE AMPLE LUSTRE THAN THE MOON
THROUGH CLOUDLESS SKY AT MIDNIGHT IN HER FULL
I TURN'D ME FULL OF WONDER TO MY GUIDE
AND HE DID ANSWER WITH A COUNTENANCE
CHARG'D WITH NO LESS AMAZEMENT WHENCE MY VIEW
REVERTED TO THOSE LOFTY THINGS WHICH CAME
SO SLOWLY MOVING TOWARDS US THAT THE BRIDE
WOULD HAVE OUTSTRIPT THEM ON HER BRIDAL DAY
THE LADY CALLED ALOUD WHY THUS YET BURNS
AFFECTION IN THEE FOR THESE LIVING LIGHTS
AND DOST NOT LOOK ON THAT WHICH FOLLOWS THEM
I STRAIGHTWAY MARK'D A TRIBE BEHIND THEM WALK
AS IF ATTENDANT ON THEIR LEADERS CLOTH'D
WITH RAIMENT OF SUCH WHITENESS AS ON EARTH
WAS NEVER
ON MY LEFT THE WAT'RY GLEAM
BORROW'D AND GAVE ME BACK WHEN THERE I LOOK'D
AS IN A MIRROR MY LEFT SIDE PORTRAY'D
WHEN I HAD CHOSEN ON THE RIVER'S EDGE
SUCH STATION THAT THE DISTANCE OF THE STREAM
ALONE DID SEPARATE ME THERE I STAY'D
MY STEPS FOR CLEARER PROSPECT AND BEHELD
THE FLAMES GO ONWARD LEAVING AS THEY WENT
THE AIR BEHIND THEM PAINTED AS WITH TRAIL
OF LIVELIEST PENCILS SO DISTINCT WERE MARK'D
ALL THOSE SEV'N LISTED COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN
MAKETH HIS BOW AND CYNTHIA HER ZONE
THESE STREAMING GONFALONS DID FLOW BEYOND
MY VISION AND TEN PACES AS I GUESS
PARTED THE OUTERMOST
BENEATH A SKY
SO BEAUTIFUL CAME FOUL AND TWENTY ELDERS
BY TWO AND TWO WITH FLOWER DE LUCES CROWN'D
ALL SANG ONE SONG BLESSED BE THOU AMONG
THE DAUGHTERS OF ADAM AND THY LOVELINESS
BLESSED FOR EVER AFTER THAT THE FLOWERS
AND THE FRESH HERBLETS ON THE OPPOSITE BRINK
WERE FREE FROM THAT ELECTED RACE AS LIGHT
IN HEAV'N DOTH SECOND LIGHT CAME AFTER THEM
FOUR ANIMALS EACH CROWN'D WITH VERDUROUS LEAF
WITH SIX WINGS EACH WAS PLUM'D THE PLUMAGE FULL
OF EYES AND TH' EYES OF ARGUS WOULD BE SUCH
WERE THEY ENDUED WITH LIFE
READER MORE RHYMES
WILL NOT WASTE IN SHADOWING FORTH THEIR FORM
FOR OTHER NEED NO STRAITENS THAT IN THIS
I MAY NOT GIVE MY BOUNTY ROOM
BUT READ
EZEKIEL FOR HE PAINTS THEM FROM THE NORTH
HOW HE BEHELD THEM COME BY CHEBAR'S FLOOD
IN WHIRLWIND CLOUD AND FIRE AND EVEN SUCH
AS THOU SHALT FIND THEM CHARACTER'D BY HIM
HERE WERE THEY SAVE AS TO THE PENNONS THERE
FROM HIM DEPARTING JOHN ACCORDS WITH ME
THE SPACE SURROUNDED BY THE FOUR ENCLOS'D
A CAR TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS IT CAME
DRAWN AT A GRYPHON'S NECK AND HE ABOVE
STRETCH'D EITHER WING UPLIFTED 'TWEEN THE MIDST
AND THE THREE LISTED HUES ON EACH SIDE THREE
SO THAT THE WINGS DID CLEAVE OR INJURE NONE
AND OUT OF SIGHT THEY ROSE
THE MEMBERS FAR
AS HE WAS BIRD WERE GOLDEN WHITE THE REST
WITH VERMEIL INTERVEIN'D
SO BEAUTIFUL
A CAR IN ROME NE'ER GRAC'D AUGUSTUS POMP
OR AFRICANUS' E'EN THE SUN'S ITSELF
WERE POOR TO THIS THAT CHARIOT OF THE SUN
ERRONEOUS WHICH IN BLAZING RUIN FELL
AT TELLUS' PRAY'R DEVOUT BY THE JUST DOOM
MYSTERIOUS OF ALL SEEING JOVE
THREE NYMPHS
AT THE RIGHT WHEEL CAME CIRCLING IN SMOOTH DANCE
THE ONE SO RUDDY THAT HER FORM HAD SCARCE
BEEN KNOWN WITHIN A FURNACE OF CLEAR FLAME
THE NEXT DID LOOK AS IF THE FLESH AND BONES
WERE EMERALD SNOW NEW FALLEN SEEM'D THE THIRD
NOW SEEM'D THE WHITE TO LEAD THE RUDDY NOW
AND FROM HER SONG WHO LED THE OTHERS TOOK
THEIR TREASURE SWIFT OR SLOW
AT TH' OTHER WHEEL
A BAND QUATERNION EACH IN PURPLE CLAD
ADVANC'D WITH FESTAL STEP AS OF THEM ONE
THE REST CONDUCTED ONE UPON WHOSE FRONT
THREE EYES WERE SEEN
IN REAR OF ALL THIS GROUP
TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD DISSIMILAR
IN RAIMENT BUT IN PORT AND GESTURE LIKE
SOLID AND MAINLY GRAVE OF WHOM THE ONE
DID SHOW HIMSELF SOME FAVOUR'D COUNSELLOR
OF THE GREAT COAN HIM WHOM NATURE MADE
TO SERVE THE COSTLIEST CREATURE OF HER TRIBE
HIS FELLOW MARK'D AN OPPOSITE INTENT
BEARING A SWORD WHOSE GLITTERANCE AND KEEN EDGE
E'EN AS I VIEW'D IT WITH THE FLOOD BETWEEN
APPALL'D ME
NEXT FOUR OTHERS I BEHELD
OF HUMBLE SEEMING AND BEHIND THEM ALL
ONE SINGLE OLD MAN SLEEPING AS HE CAME
WITH A SHREWD VISAGE
AND THESE SEVEN EACH
LIKE THE FIRST TROOP WERE HABITED BUT WORE
NO BRAID OF LILIES ON THEIR TEMPLES WREATH'D
RATHER WITH ROSES AND EACH VERMEIL FLOWER
A SIGHT BUT LITTLE DISTANT MIGHT HAVE SWORN
THAT THEY WERE ALL ON FIRE ABOVE THEIR BROW
WHENAS THE CAR WAS O'ER AGAINST ME STRAIGHT
WAS HEARD A THUND'RING AT WHOSE VOICE IT SEEM'D
THE CHOSEN MULTITUDE WERE STAY'D FOR THERE
WITH THE FIRST ENSIGNS MADE THEY SOLEMN HALT
CANTO XXX
SOON AS THE POLAR LIGHT WHICH NEVER KNOWS
SETTING NOR RISING NOR THE SHADOWY VEIL
OF OTHER CLOUD THAN SIN FAIR ORNAMENT
OF THE FIRST HEAV'N TO DUTY EACH ONE THERE
SAFELY CONVOYING AS THAT LOWER DOTH
THE STEERSMAN TO HIS PORT STOOD FIRMLY FIX'D
FORTHWITH THE SAINTLY TRIBE WHO IN THE VAN
BETWEEN THE GRYPHON AND ITS RADIANCE CAME
DID TURN THEM TO THE CAR AS TO THEIR REST
AND ONE AS IF COMMISSION'D FROM ABOVE
IN HOLY CHANT THRICE SHORTED FORTH ALOUD
COME SPOUSE FROM LIBANUS AND ALL THE REST
TOOK UP THE SONG AT THE LAST AUDIT SO
THE BLEST SHALL RISE FROM FORTH HIS CAVERN EACH
UPLIFTING LIGHTLY HIS NEW VESTED FLESH
AS ON THE SACRED LITTER AT THE VOICE
AUTHORITATIVE OF THAT ELDER SPRANG
A HUNDRED MINISTERS AND MESSENGERS
OF LIFE ETERNAL
BLESSED THOU WHO COM'ST
AND O THEY CRIED FROM FULL HANDS SCATTER YE
UNWITH'RING LILIES AND SO SAYING CAST
FLOWERS OVER HEAD AND ROUND THEM ON ALL SIDES
I HAVE BEHELD ERE NOW AT BREAK OF DAY
THE EASTERN CLIME ALL ROSEATE AND THE SKY
OPPOS'D ONE DEEP AND BEAUTIFUL SERENE
AND THE SUN'S FACE SO SHADED AND WITH MISTS
ATTEMPER'D AT LIDS RISING THAT THE EYE
LONG WHILE ENDUR'D THE SIGHT THUS IN A CLOUD
OF FLOWERS THAT FROM THOSE HANDS ANGELIC ROSE
AND DOWN WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE CAR
FELL SHOWERING IN WHITE VEIL WITH OLIVE WREATH'D
A VIRGIN IN MY VIEW APPEAR'D BENEATH
GREEN MANTLE ROB'D IN HUE OF LIVING FLAME
AND O'ER MY SPIRIT THAT IN FORMER DAYS
WITHIN HER PRESENCE HAD ABODE SO LONG
NO SHUDD'RING TERROR CREPT
MINE EYES NO MORE
HAD KNOWLEDGE OF HER YET THERE MOV'D FROM HER
A HIDDEN VIRTUE AT WHOSE TOUCH AWAK'D
THE POWER OF ANCIENT LOVE WAS STRONG WITHIN ME
NO SOONER ON MY VISION STREAMING SMOTE
THE HEAV'NLY INFLUENCE WHICH YEARS PAST AND E'EN
IN CHILDHOOD THRILL'D ME THAN TOWARDS VIRGIL I
TURN'D ME TO LEFTWARD PANTING LIKE A BABE
THAT FLEES FOR REFUGE TO HIS MOTHER'S BREAST
IF AUGHT HAVE TERRIFIED OR WORK'D HIM WOE
AND WOULD HAVE CRIED THERE IS NO DRAM OF BLOOD
THAT DOTH NOT QUIVER IN ME
THE OLD FLAME
THROWS OUT CLEAR TOKENS OF REVIVING FIRE
BUT VIRGIL HAD BEREAV'D US OF HIMSELF
VIRGIL MY BEST LOV'D FATHER VIRGIL HE
TO WHOM I GAVE ME UP FOR SAFETY NOR
ALL OUR PRIME MOTHER LOST AVAIL'D TO SAVE
MY UNDEW'D CHEEKS FROM BLUR OF SOILING TEARS
DANTE WEEP NOT THAT VIRGIL LEAVES THEE NAY
WEEP THOU NOT YET BEHOOVES THEE FEEL THE EDGE
OF OTHER SWORD AND THOU SHALT WEEP FOR THAT
AS TO THE PROW OR STERN SOME ADMIRAL
PACES THE DECK INSPIRITING HIS CREW
WHEN 'MID THE SAIL YARDS ALL HANDS PLY ALOOF
THUS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR I SAW
TURNING ME AT THE SOUND OF MINE OWN NAME
WHICH HERE I AM COMPELL'D TO REGISTER
THE VIRGIN STATION'D WHO BEFORE APPEARED
VEIL'D IN THAT FESTIVE SHOWER ANGELICAL
TOWARDS ME ACROSS THE STREAM SHE BENT HER EYES
THOUGH FROM HER BROW THE VEIL DESCENDING BOUND
WITH FOLIAGE OF MINERVA SUFFER'D NOT
THAT I BEHELD HER CLEARLY THEN WITH ACT
FULL ROYAL STILL INSULTING O'ER HER THRALL
ADDED AS ONE WHO SPEAKING KEEPETH BACK
THE BITTEREST SAYING TO CONCLUDE THE SPEECH
OBSERVE ME WELL
I AM IN SOOTH I AM
BEATRICE
WHAT AND HAST THOU DEIGN'D AT LAST
APPROACH THE MOUNTAINNEWEST NOT O MAN
THY HAPPINESS IS WHOLE DOWN FELL MINE EYES
ON THE CLEAR FOUNT BUT THERE MYSELF ESPYING
RECOIL'D AND SOUGHT THE GREENSWARD SUCH A WEIGHT
OF SHAME WAS ON MY FOREHEAD
WITH A MIEN
OF THAT STERN MAJESTY WHICH DOTH SURROUND
MOTHER'S PRESENCE TO HER AWE STRUCK CHILD
SHE LOOK'D A FLAVOUR OF SUCH BITTERNESS
WAS MINGLED IN HER PITY
THERE HER WORDS
BRAKE OFF AND SUDDENLY THE ANGELS SANG
IN THEE O GRACIOUS LORD MY HOPE HATH BEEN
BUT WENT NO FARTHER THAN THOU LORD HAST SET
MY FEET IN AMPLE ROOM AS SNOW THAT LIES
AMIDST THE LIVING RAFTERS ON THE BACK
OF ITALY CONGEAL'D WHEN DRIFTED HIGH
AND CLOSELY PIL'D BY ROUGH SCLAVONIAN BLASTS
BREATHE BUT THE LAND WHEREON NO SHADOW FALLS
AND STRAIGHTWAY MELTING IT DISTILS AWAY
LIKE A FIRE WASTED TAPER THUS WAS I
WITHOUT A SIGH OR TEAR OR EVER THESE
DID SING THAT WITH THE CHIMING OF HEAV'N'S SPHERE
STILL IN THEIR WARBLING CHIME BUT WHEN THE STRAIN
OF DULCET SYMPHONY EXPRESS'D FOR ME
THEIR SOFT COMPASSION MORE THAN COULD THE WORDS
VIRGIN WHY SO CONSUM'ST HIM THEN THE ICE
CONGEAL'D ABOUT MY BOSOM TURN'D ITSELF
TO SPIRIT AND WATER AND WITH ANGUISH FORTH
GUSH'D THROUGH THE LIPS AND EYELIDS FROM THE HEART
UPON THE CHARIOT'S RIGHT EDGE STILL SHE STOOD
IMMOVABLE AND THUS ADDRESS'D HER WORDS
TO THOSE BRIGHT SEMBLANCES WITH PITY TOUCH'D
YE IN TH' ETERNAL DAY YOUR VIGILS KEEP
SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLUMBER WITH CLOSE STEALTH
CONVEYS FROM YOU A SINGLE STEP IN ALL
THE GOINGS ON OF LIFE THENCE WITH MORE HEED
I SHAPE MINE ANSWER FOR HIS EAR INTENDED
WHO THERE STANDS WEEPING THAT THE SORROW NOW
MAY EQUAL THE TRANSGRESSION
NOT ALONE
THROUGH OPERATION OF THE MIGHTY ORBS
THAT MARK EACH SEED TO SOME PREDESTIN'D AIM
AS WITH ASPECT OR FORTUNATE OR ILL
THE CONSTELLATIONS MEET BUT THROUGH BENIGN
LARGESS OF HEAV'NLY GRACES WHICH RAIN DOWN
FROM SUCH A HEIGHT AS MOCKS OUR VISION THIS MAN
WAS IN THE FRESHNESS OF HIS BEING SUCH
SO GIFTED VIRTUALLY THAT IN HIM
ALL BETTER HABITS WOND'ROUSLY HAD THRIV'D
THE MORE OF KINDLY STRENGTH IS IN THE SOIL
SO MUCH DOTH EVIL SEED AND LACK OF CULTURE
MAR IT THE MORE AND MAKE IT RUN TO WILDNESS
THESE LOOKS SOMETIME UPHELD HIM FOR I SHOW'D
MY YOUTHFUL EYES AND LED HIM BY THEIR LIGHT
IN UPRIGHT WALKING
SOON AS I HAD REACH'D
THE THRESHOLD OF MY SECOND AGE AND CHANG'D
MY MORTAL FOR IMMORTAL THEN HE LEFT ME
AND GAVE HIMSELF TO OTHERS
WHEN FROM FLESH
TO SPIRIT I HAD RISEN AND INCREASE
OF BEAUTY AND OF VIRTUE CIRCLED ME
I WAS LESS DEAR TO HIM AND VALUED LESS
HIS STEPS WERE TURN'D INTO DECEITFUL WAYS
FOLLOWING FALSE IMAGES OF GOOD THAT MAKE
NO PROMISE PERFECT
NOR AVAIL'D ME AUGHT
TO SUE FOR INSPIRATIONS WITH THE WHICH
I BOTH IN DREAMS OF NIGHT AND OTHERWISE
DID CALL HIM BACK OF THEM SO LITTLE RECK'D HIM
SUCH DEPTH HE FELL THAT ALL DEVICE WAS SHORT
OF HIS PRESERVING SAVE THAT HE SHOULD VIEW
THE CHILDREN OF PERDITION
TO THIS END
I VISITED THE PURLIEUS OF THE DEAD
AND ONE WHO HATH CONDUCTED HIM THUS HIGH
RECEIV'D MY SUPPLICATIONS URG'D WITH WEEPING
IT WERE A BREAKING OF GOD'S HIGH DECREE
IF LETHE SHOULD BE PAST AND SUCH FOOD TASTED
WITHOUT THE COST OF SOME REPENTANT TEAR
CANTO XXXI
O THOU HER WORDS SHE THUS WITHOUT DELAY
RESUMING TURN'D THEIR POINT ON ME TO WHOM
THEY BUT WITH LATERAL EDGE SEEM'D HARSH BEFORE
SAY THOU WHO STAND'ST BEYOND THE HOLY STREAM
IF THIS BE TRUE
A CHARGE SO GRIEVOUS NEEDS
THINE OWN AVOWAL ON MY FACULTY
SUCH STRANGE AMAZEMENT HUNG THE VOICE EXPIR'D
IMPERFECT ERE ITS ORGANS GAVE IT BIRTH
A LITTLE SPACE REFRAINING THEN SHE SPAKE
WHAT DOST THOU MUSE ON ANSWER ME
THE WAVE
ON THY REMEMBRANCES OF EVIL YET
HATH DONE NO INJURY A MINGLED SENSE
OF FEAR AND OF CONFUSION FROM MY LIPS
DID SUCH A YEA PRODUCE AS NEEDED HELP
OF VISION TO INTERPRET
AS WHEN BREAKS
IN ACT TO BE DISCHARG'D A CROSS BOW BENT
BEYOND ITS PITCH BOTH NERVE AND BOW O'ERSTRETCH'D
THE FLAGGING WEAPON FEEBLY HITS THE MARK
THUS TEARS AND SIGHS FORTH GUSHING DID I BURST
BENEATH THE HEAVY LOAD AND THUS MY VOICE
WAS SLACKEN'D ON ITS WAY
SHE STRAIGHT BEGAN
WHEN MY DESIRE INVITED THEE TO LOVE
THE GOOD WHICH SETS A BOUND TO OUR ASPIRINGS
WHAT BAR OF THWARTING FOSS OR LINKED CHAIN
DID MEET THEE THAT THOU SO SHOULD'ST QUIT THE HOPE
OF FURTHER PROGRESS OR WHAT BAIT OF EASE
OR PROMISE OF ALLUREMENT LED THEE ON
ELSEWHERE THAT THOU ELSEWHERE SHOULD'ST RATHER WAIT
A BITTER SIGH I DREW THEN SCARCE FOUND VOICE
TO ANSWER HARDLY TO THESE SOUNDS MY LIPS
GAVE UTTERANCE WAILING THY FAIR LOOKS WITHDRAWN
THINGS PRESENT WITH DECEITFUL PLEASURES TURN'D
MY STEPS ASIDE SHE ANSWERING SPAKE HADST THOU
BEEN SILENT OR DENIED WHAT THOU AVOW'ST
THOU HADST NOT HID THY SIN THE MORE SUCH EYE
OBSERVES IT
BUT WHENE'ER THE SINNER'S CHEEK
BREAKS FORTH INTO THE PRECIOUS STREAMING TEARS
OF SELF ACCUSING IN OUR COURT THE WHEEL
OF JUSTICE DOTH RUN COUNTER TO THE EDGE
HOWE'ER THAT THOU MAY'ST PROFIT BY THY SHAME
FOR ERRORS PAST AND THAT HENCEFORTH MORE STRENGTH
MAY ARM THEE WHEN THOU HEAR'ST THE SIREN VOICE
LAY THOU ASIDE THE MOTIVE TO THIS GRIEF
AND LEND ATTENTIVE EAR WHILE I UNFOLD
HOW OPPOSITE A WAY MY BURIED FLESH
SHOULD HAVE IMPELL'D THEE
NEVER DIDST THOU SPY
IN ART OR NATURE AUGHT SO PASSING SWEET
AS WERE THE LIMBS THAT IN THEIR BEAUTEOUS FRAME
ENCLOS'D ME AND ARE SCATTER'D NOW IN DUST
IF SWEETEST THING THUS FAIL'D THEE WITH MY DEATH
WHAT AFTERWARD OF MORTAL SHOULD THY WISH
HAVE TEMPTED WHEN THOU FIRST HADST FELT THE DART
OF PERISHABLE THINGS IN MY DEPARTING
FOR BETTER REALMS THY WING THOU SHOULD'ST HAVE PRUN'D
TO FOLLOW ME AND NEVER STOOP'D AGAIN
TO 'BIDE A SECOND BLOW FOR A SLIGHT GIRL
OR OTHER GAUD AS TRANSIENT AND AS VAIN
THE NEW AND INEXPERIENC'D BIRD AWAITS
TWICE IT MAY BE OR THRICE THE FOWLER'S AIM
BUT IN THE SIGHT OF ONE WHOSE PLUMES ARE FULL
IN VAIN THE NET IS SPREAD THE ARROW WING'D
I STOOD AS CHILDREN SILENT AND ASHAM'D
STAND LIST'NING WITH THEIR EYES UPON THE EARTH
ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR FAULT AND SELF CONDEMN'D
AND SHE RESUM'D IF BUT TO HEAR THUS PAINS THEE
RAISE THOU THY BEARD AND LO WHAT SIGHT SHALL DO
WITH LESS RELUCTANCE YIELDS A STURDY HOLM
RENT FROM ITS FIBERS BY A BLAST THAT BLOWS
FROM OFF THE POLE OR FROM IARBAS' LAND
THAN I AT HER BEHEST MY VISAGE RAIS'D
AND THUS THE FACE DENOTING BY THE BEARD
I MARK'D THE SECRET STING HER WORDS CONVEY'D
NO SOONER LIFTED I MINE ASPECT UP
THAN DOWNWARD SUNK THAT VISION I BEHELD
OF GOODLY CREATURES VANISH AND MINE EYES
YET UNASSUR'D AND WAVERING BENT THEIR LIGHT
ON BEATRICE
TOWARDS THE ANIMAL
WHO JOINS TWO NATURES IN ONE FORM SHE TURN'D
AND EVEN UNDER SHADOW OF HER VEIL
AND PARTED BY THE VERDANT RILL THAT FLOW'D
BETWEEN IN LOVELINESS APPEAR'D AS MUCH
HER FORMER SELF SURPASSING AS ON EARTH
ALL OTHERS SHE SURPASS'D
REMORSEFUL GOADS
SHOT SUDDEN THROUGH ME
EACH THING ELSE THE MORE
ITS LOVE HAD LATE BEGUIL'D ME NOW THE MORE
I WAS LOATHSOME
ON MY HEART SO KEENLY SMOTE
THE BITTER CONSCIOUSNESS THAT ON THE GROUND
O'ERPOWER'D I FELL AND WHAT MY STATE WAS THEN
SHE KNOWS WHO WAS THE CAUSE
WHEN NOW MY STRENGTH
FLOW'D BACK RETURNING OUTWARD FROM THE HEART
THE LADY WHOM ALONE I FIRST HAD SEEN
I FOUND ABOVE ME
LOOSE ME NOT SHE CRIED
LOOSE NOT THY HOLD AND LO HAD DRAGG'D ME HIGH
AS TO MY NECK INTO THE STREAM WHILE SHE
STILL AS SHE DREW ME AFTER SWEPT ALONG
SWIFT AS A SHUTTLE BOUNDING O'ER THE WAVE
THE BLESSED SHORE APPROACHING THEN WAS HEARD
SO SWEETLY TU ASPERGES ME THAT I
MAY NOT REMEMBER MUCH LESS TELL THE SOUND
THE BEAUTEOUS DAME HER ARMS EXPANDING CLASP'D
MY TEMPLES AND IMMERG'D ME WHERE 'T WAS FIT
THE WAVE SHOULD DRENCH ME AND THENCE RAISING UP
WITHIN THE FOURFOLD DANCE OF LOVELY NYMPHS
PRESENTED ME SO LAV'D AND WITH THEIR ARM
THEY EACH DID COVER ME
HERE ARE WE NYMPHS
AND IN THE HEAV'N ARE STARS
OR EVER EARTH
WAS VISITED OF BEATRICE WE
APPOINTED FOR HER HANDMAIDS TENDED ON HER
WE TO HER EYES WILL LEAD THEE BUT THE LIGHT
OF GLADNESS THAT IS IN THEM WELL TO SCAN
THOSE YONDER THREE OF DEEPER KEN THAN OURS
THY SIGHT SHALL QUICKEN THUS BEGAN THEIR SONG
AND THEN THEY LED ME TO THE GRYPHON'S BREAST
WHILE TURN'D TOWARD US BEATRICE STOOD
SPARE NOT THY VISION
WE HAVE STATIONED THEE
BEFORE THE EMERALDS WHENCE LOVE EREWHILE
HATH DRAWN HIS WEAPONS ON THEE AS THEY SPAKE
A THOUSAND FERVENT WISHES RIVETED
MINE EYES UPON HER BEAMING EYES THAT STOOD
STILL FIX'D TOWARD THE GRYPHON MOTIONLESS
AS THE SUN STRIKES A MIRROR EVEN THUS
WITHIN THOSE ORBS THE TWOFOLD BEING SHONE
FOR EVER VARYING IN ONE FIGURE NOW
REFLECTED NOW IN OTHER
READER MUSE
HOW WOND'ROUS IN MY SIGHT IT SEEM'D TO MARK
A THING ALBEIT STEADFAST IN ITSELF
YET IN ITS IMAG'D SEMBLANCE MUTABLE
FULL OF AMAZE AND JOYOUS WHILE MY SOUL
FED ON THE VIAND WHEREOF STILL DESIRE
GROWS WITH SATIETY THE OTHER THREE
WITH GESTURE THAT DECLAR'D A LOFTIER LINE
ADVANC'D TO THEIR OWN CAROL ON THEY CAME
DANCING IN FESTIVE RING ANGELICAL
TURN BEATRICE WAS THEIR SONG O TURN
THY SAINTLY SIGHT ON THIS THY FAITHFUL ONE
WHO TO BEHOLD THEE MANY A WEARISOME PACE
HATH MEASUR'D
GRACIOUS AT OUR PRAY'R VOUCHSAFE
UNVEIL TO HIM THY CHEEKS THAT HE MAY MARK
THY SECOND BEAUTY NOW CONCEAL'D O SPLENDOUR
O SACRED LIGHT ETERNAL WHO IS HE
SO PALE WITH MUSING IN PIERIAN SHADES
OR WITH THAT FOUNT SO LAVISHLY IMBUED
WHOSE SPIRIT SHOULD NOT FAIL HIM IN TH' ESSAY
TO REPRESENT THEE SUCH AS THOU DIDST SEEM
WHEN UNDER COPE OF THE STILL CHIMING HEAVEN
THOU GAV'ST TO OPEN AIR THY CHARMS REVEAL'D
CANTO XXXII
MINE EYES WITH SUCH AN EAGER COVETING
WERE BENT TO RID THEM OF THEIR TEN YEARS' THIRST
NO OTHER SENSE WAS WAKING AND E'EN THEY
WERE FENC'D ON EITHER SIDE FROM HEED OF AUGHT
SO TANGLED IN ITS CUSTOM'D TOILS THAT SMILE
OF SAINTLY BRIGHTNESS DREW ME TO ITSELF
WHEN FORCIBLY TOWARD THE LEFT MY SIGHT
THE SACRED VIRGINS TURN'D FOR FROM THEIR LIPS
I HEARD THE WARNING SOUNDS TOO FIX'D A GAZE
AWHILE MY VISION LABOR'D AS WHEN LATE
UPON THE' O'ERSTRAINED EYES THE SUN HATH SMOTE
BUT SOON TO LESSER OBJECT AS THE VIEW
WAS NOW RECOVER'D LESSER IN RESPECT
TO THAT EXCESS OF SENSIBLE WHENCE LATE
I HAD PERFORCE BEEN SUNDER'D ON THEIR RIGHT
I MARK'D THAT GLORIOUS ARMY WHEEL AND TURN
AGAINST THE SUN AND SEV'NFOLD LIGHTS THEIR FRONT
AS WHEN THEIR BUCKLERS FOR PROTECTION RAIS'D
A WELL RANG'D TROOP WITH PORTLY BANNERS CURL'D
WHEEL CIRCLING ERE THE WHOLE CAN CHANGE THEIR GROUND
E'EN THUS THE GOODLY REGIMENT OF HEAV'N
PROCEEDING ALL DID PASS US ERE THE CAR
HAD SLOP'D HIS BEAM
ATTENDANT AT THE WHEELS
THE DAMSELS TURN'D AND ON THE GRYPHON MOV'D
THE SACRED BURDEN WITH A PACE SO SMOOTH
NO FEATHER ON HIM TREMBLED
THE FAIR DAME
WHO THROUGH THE WAVE HAD DRAWN ME COMPANIED
BY STATIUS AND MYSELF PURSUED THE WHEEL
WHOSE ORBIT ROLLING MARK'D A LESSER ARCH
THROUGH THE HIGH WOOD NOW VOID THE MORE HER BLAME
WHO BY THE SERPENT WAS BEGUIL'D I PAST
WITH STEP IN CADENCE TO THE HARMONY
ANGELIC
ONWARD HAD WE MOV'D AS FAR
PERCHANCE AS ARROW AT THREE SEVERAL FLIGHTS
FULL WING'D HAD SPED WHEN FROM HER STATION DOWN
DESCENDED BEATRICE
WITH ONE VOICE
ALL MURMUR'D ADAM CIRCLING NEXT A PLANT
DESPOIL'D OF FLOWERS AND LEAF ON EVERY BOUGH
ITS TRESSES SPREADING MORE AS MORE THEY ROSE
WERE SUCH AS 'MIDST THEIR FOREST WILDS FOR HEIGHT
THE INDIANS MIGHT HAVE GAZ'D AT
BLESSED THOU
GRYPHON WHOSE BEAK HATH NEVER PLUCK'D THAT TREE
PLEASANT TO TASTE FOR HENCE THE APPETITE
WAS WARP'D TO EVIL ROUND THE STATELY TRUNK
THUS SHOUTED FORTH THE REST TO WHOM RETURN'D
THE ANIMAL TWICE GENDER'D YEA FOR SO
THE GENERATION OF THE JUST ARE SAV'D
AND TURNING TO THE CHARIOT POLE TO FOOT
HE DREW IT OF THE WIDOW'D BRANCH AND BOUND
THERE LEFT UNTO THE STOCK WHEREON IT GREW
AS WHEN LARGE FLOODS OF RADIANCE FROM ABOVE
STREAM WITH THAT RADIANCE MINGLED WHICH ASCENDS
NEXT AFTER SETTING OF THE SCALY SIGN
OUR PLANTS THEN BURGEON AND EACH WEARS ANEW
HIS WONTED COLOURS ERE THE SUN HAVE YOK'D
BENEATH ANOTHER STAR HIS FLAMY STEEDS
THUS PUTTING FORTH A HUE MORE FAINT THAN ROSE
AND DEEPER THAN THE VIOLET WAS RENEW'D
THE PLANT EREWHILE IN ALL ITS BRANCHES BARE
UNEARTHLY WAS THE HYMN WHICH THEN AROSE
I UNDERSTOOD IT NOT NOR TO THE END
ENDUR'D THE HARMONY
HAD I THE SKILL
TO PENCIL FORTH HOW CLOS'D TH' UNPITYING EYES
SLUMB'RING WHEN SYRINX WARBLED EYES THAT PAID
SO DEARLY FOR THEIR WATCHING THEN LIKE PAINTER
THAT WITH A MODEL PAINTS I MIGHT DESIGN
THE MANNER OF MY FALLING INTO SLEEP
BUT FEIGN WHO WILL THE SLUMBER CUNNINGLY
I PASS IT BY TO WHEN I WAK'D AND TELL
HOW SUDDENLY A FLASH OF SPLENDOUR RENT
THE CURTAIN OF MY SLEEP AND ONE CRIES OUT
ARISE WHAT DOST THOU AS THE CHOSEN THREE
ON TABOR'S MOUNT ADMITTED TO BEHOLD
THE BLOSSOMING OF THAT FAIR TREE WHOSE FRUIT
IS COVETED OF ANGELS AND DOTH MAKE
PERPETUAL FEAST IN HEAVEN TO THEMSELVES
RETURNING AT THE WORD WHENCE DEEPER SLEEPS
WERE BROKEN THAT THEY THEIR TRIBE DIMINISH'D SAW
BOTH MOSES AND ELIAS GONE AND CHANG'D
THE STOLE THEIR MASTER WORE THUS TO MYSELF
RETURNING OVER ME BEHELD I STAND
THE PITEOUS ONE WHO CROSS THE STREAM HAD BROUGHT
MY STEPS
AND WHERE ALL DOUBTING I EXCLAIM'D
IS BEATRICE SEE HER SHE REPLIED
BENEATH THE FRESH LEAF SEATED ON ITS ROOT
BEHOLD TH' ASSOCIATE CHOIR THAT CIRCLES HER
THE OTHERS WITH A MELODY MORE SWEET
AND MORE PROFOUND JOURNEYING TO HIGHER REALMS
UPON THE GRYPHON TEND IF THERE HER WORDS
WERE CLOS'D I KNOW NOT BUT MINE EYES HAD NOW
TA'EN VIEW OF HER BY WHOM ALL OTHER THOUGHTS
WERE BARR'D ADMITTANCE
ON THE VERY GROUND
ALONE SHE SAT AS SHE HAD THERE BEEN LEFT
A GUARD UPON THE WAIN WHICH I BEHELD
BOUND TO THE TWYFORM BEAST
THE SEVEN NYMPHS
DID MAKE THEMSELVES A CLOISTER ROUND ABOUT HER
AND IN THEIR HANDS UPHELD THOSE LIGHTS SECURE
FROM BLAST SEPTENTRION AND THE GUSTY SOUTH
A LITTLE WHILE THOU SHALT BE FORESTER HERE
AND CITIZEN SHALT BE FOREVER WITH ME
OF THAT TRUE ROME WHEREIN CHRIST DWELLS A ROMAN
TO PROFIT THE MISGUIDED WORLD KEEP NOW
THINE EYES UPON THE CAR AND WHAT THOU SEEST
TAKE HEED THOU WRITE RETURNING TO THAT PLACE
THUS BEATRICE AT WHOSE FEET INCLIN'D
DEVOUT AT HER BEHEST MY THOUGHT AND EYES
I AS SHE BADE DIRECTED
NEVER FIRE
WITH SO SWIFT MOTION FORTH A STORMY CLOUD
LEAP'D DOWNWARD FROM THE WELKIN'S FARTHEST BOUND
AS I BEHELD THE BIRD OF JOVE DESCENDING
POUNCE ON THE TREE AND AS HE RUSH'D THE RIND
DISPARTING CRUSH BENEATH HIM BUDS MUCH MORE
AND LEAFLETS
ON THE CAR WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
HE STRUCK WHENCE STAGGERING LIKE A SHIP IT REEL'D
AT RANDOM DRIV'N TO STARBOARD NOW O'ERCOME
AND NOW TO LARBOARD BY THE VAULTING WAVES
NEXT SPRINGING UP INTO THE CHARIOT'S WOMB
A FOX I SAW WITH HUNGER SEEMING PIN'D
OF ALL GOOD FOOD
BUT FOR HIS UGLY SINS
THE SAINTLY MAID REBUKING HIM AWAY
SCAMP'RING HE TURN'D FAST AS HIS HIDE BOUND CORPSE
WOULD BEAR HIM
NEXT FROM WHENCE BEFORE HE CAME
I SAW THE EAGLE DART INTO THE HULL
O' TH' CAR AND LEAVE IT WITH HIS FEATHERS LIN'D
AND THEN A VOICE LIKE THAT WHICH ISSUES FORTH
FROM HEART WITH SORROW RIV'D DID ISSUE FORTH
FROM HEAV'N AND O POOR BARK OF MINE IT CRIED
HOW BADLY ART THOU FREIGHTED THEN IT SEEM'D
THAT THE EARTH OPEN'D BETWEEN EITHER WHEEL
AND I BEHELD A DRAGON ISSUE THENCE
THAT THROUGH THE CHARIOT FIX'D HIS FORKED TRAIN
AND LIKE A WASP THAT DRAGGETH BACK THE STING
SO DRAWING FORTH HIS BALEFUL TRAIN HE DRAGG'D
PART OF THE BOTTOM FORTH AND WENT HIS WAY
EXULTING
WHAT REMAIN'D AS LIVELY TURF
WITH GREEN HERB SO DID CLOTHE ITSELF WITH PLUMES
WHICH HAPLY HAD WITH PURPOSE CHASTE AND KIND
BEEN OFFER'D AND THEREWITH WERE CLOTH'D THE WHEELS
BOTH ONE AND OTHER AND THE BEAM SO QUICKLY
A SIGH WERE NOT BREATH'D SOONER
THUS TRANSFORM'D
THE HOLY STRUCTURE THROUGH ITS SEVERAL PARTS
DID PUT FORTH HEADS THREE ON THE BEAM AND ONE
ON EVERY SIDE THE FIRST LIKE OXEN HORN'D
BUT WITH A SINGLE HORN UPON THEIR FRONT
THE FOUR
LIKE MONSTER SIGHT HATH NEVER SEEN
O'ER IT METHOUGHT THERE SAT SECURE AS ROCK
ON MOUNTAIN'S LOFTY TOP A SHAMELESS WHORE
WHOSE KEN ROV'D LOOSELY ROUND HER
AT HER SIDE
AS 'T WERE THAT NONE MIGHT BEAR HER OFF I SAW
A GIANT STAND AND EVER AND ANON
THEY MINGLED KISSES
BUT HER LUSTFUL EYES
CHANCING ON ME TO WANDER THAT FELL MINION
SCOURG'D HER FROM HEAD TO FOOT ALL O'ER THEN FULL
OF JEALOUSY AND FIERCE WITH RAGE UNLOOS'D
THE MONSTER AND DRAGG'D ON SO FAR ACROSS
THE FOREST THAT FROM ME ITS SHADES ALONE
SHIELDED THE HARLOT AND THE NEW FORM'D BRUTE
CANTO XXXIII
THE HEATHEN LORD ARE COME RESPONSIVE THUS
THE TRINAL NOW AND NOW THE VIRGIN BAND
QUATERNION THEIR SWEET PSALMODY BEGAN
WEEPING AND BEATRICE LISTEN'D SAD
AND SIGHING TO THE SONG' IN SUCH A MOOD
THAT MARY AS SHE STOOD BESIDE THE CROSS
WAS SCARCE MORE CHANG'D
BUT WHEN THEY GAVE HER PLACE
TO SPEAK THEN RISEN UPRIGHT ON HER FEET
SHE WITH A COLOUR GLOWING BRIGHT AS FIRE
DID ANSWER YET A LITTLE WHILE AND YE
SHALL SEE ME NOT AND MY BELOVED SISTERS
AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE AND YE SHALL SEE ME
BEFORE HER THEN SHE MARSHALL'D ALL THE SEVEN
AND BECK'NING ONLY MOTION'D ME THE DAME
AND THAT REMAINING SAGE TO FOLLOW HER
SO ON SHE PASS'D AND HAD NOT SET I WEEN
HER TENTH STEP TO THE GROUND WHEN WITH MINE EYES
HER EYES ENCOUNTER'D AND WITH VISAGE MILD
SO MEND THY PACE SHE CRIED THAT IF MY WORDS
ADDRESS THEE THOU MAYST STILL BE APTLY PLAC'D
TO HEAR THEM SOON AS DULY TO HER SIDE
I NOW HAD HASTEN'D BROTHER SHE BEGAN
WHY MAK'ST THOU NO ATTEMPT AT QUESTIONING
AS THUS WE WALK TOGETHER LIKE TO THOSE
WHO SPEAKING WITH TOO REVERENT AN AWE
BEFORE THEIR BETTERS DRAW NOT FORTH THE VOICE
ALIVE UNTO THEIR LIPS BEFELL ME SHELL
THAT I IN SOUNDS IMPERFECT THUS BEGAN
LADY WHAT I HAVE NEED OF THAT THOU KNOW'ST
AND WHAT WILL SUIT MY NEED SHE ANSWERING THUS
OF FEARFULNESS AND SHAME I WILL THAT THOU
HENCEFORTH DO RID THEE THAT THOU SPEAK NO MORE
AS ONE WHO DREAMS
THUS FAR BE TAUGHT OF ME
THE VESSEL WHICH THOU SAW'ST THE SERPENT BREAK
WAS AND IS NOT LET HIM WHO HATH THE BLAME
HOPE NOT TO SCARE GOD'S VENGEANCE WITH A SOP
WITHOUT AN HEIR FOR EVER SHALL NOT BE
THAT EAGLE HE WHO LEFT THE CHARIOT PLUM'D
WHICH MONSTER MADE IT FIRST AND NEXT A PREY
PLAINLY I VIEW AND THEREFORE SPEAK THE STARS
E'EN NOW APPROACHING WHOSE CONJUNCTION FREE
FROM ALL IMPEDIMENT AND BAR BRINGS ON
A SEASON IN THE WHICH ONE SENT FROM GOD
FIVE HUNDRED FIVE AND TEN DO MARK HIM OUT
THAT FOUL ONE AND TH' ACCOMPLICE OF HER GUILT
THE GIANT BOTH SHALL SLAY
AND IF PERCHANCE
MY SAYING DARK AS THEMIS OR AS SPHINX
FAIL TO PERSUADE THEE SINCE LIKE THEM IT FOILS
THE INTELLECT WITH BLINDNESS YET ERE LONG
EVENTS SHALL BE THE NAIADS THAT WILL SOLVE
THIS KNOTTY RIDDLE AND NO DAMAGE LIGHT
ON FLOCK OR FIELD
TAKE HEED AND AS THESE WORDS
BY ME ARE UTTER'D TEACH THEM EVEN SO
TO THOSE WHO LIVE THAT LIFE WHICH IS A RACE
TO DEATH AND WHEN THOU WRIT'ST THEM KEEP IN MIND
NOT TO CONCEAL HOW THOU HAST SEEN THE PLANT
THAT TWICE HATH NOW BEEN SPOIL'D
THIS WHOSO ROBS
THIS WHOSO PLUCKS WITH BLASPHEMY OF DEED
SINS AGAINST GOD WHO FOR HIS USE ALONE
CREATING HALLOW'D IT
FOR TASTE OF THIS
IN PAIN AND IN DESIRE FIVE THOUSAND YEARS
AND UPWARD THE FIRST SOUL DID YEARN FOR HIM
WHO PUNISH'D IN HIMSELF THE FATAL GUST
THY REASON SLUMBERS IF IT DEEM THIS HEIGHT
AND SUMMIT THUS INVERTED OF THE PLANT
WITHOUT DUE CAUSE AND WERE NOT VAINER THOUGHTS
AS ELSA'S NUMBING WATERS TO THY SOUL
AND THEIR FOND PLEASURES HAD NOT DYED IT DARK
AS PYRAMUS THE MULBERRY THOU HADST SEEN
IN SUCH MOMENTOUS CIRCUMSTANCE ALONE
GOD'S EQUAL JUSTICE MORALLY IMPLIED
IN THE FORBIDDEN TREE
BUT SINCE I MARK THEE
IN UNDERSTANDING HARDEN'D INTO STONE
AND TO THAT HARDNESS SPOTTED TOO AND STAIN'D
SO THAT THINE EYE IS DAZZLED AT MY WORD
I WILL THAT IF NOT WRITTEN YET AT LEAST
PAINTED THOU TAKE IT IN THEE FOR THE CAUSE
THAT ONE BRINGS HOME HIS STAFF INWREATH'D WITH PALM
I THUS AS WAX BY SEAL THAT CHANGETH NOT
ITS IMPRESS NOW IS STAMP'D MY BRAIN BY THEE
BUT WHEREFORE SOARS THY WISH'D FOR SPEECH SO HIGH
BEYOND MY SIGHT THAT LOSES IT THE MORE
THE MORE IT STRAINS TO REACH IT TO THE END
THAT THOU MAYST KNOW SHE ANSWER'D STRAIGHT THE SCHOOL
THAT THOU HAST FOLLOW'D AND HOW FAR BEHIND
WHEN FOLLOWING MY DISCOURSE ITS LEARNING HALTS
AND MAYST BEHOLD YOUR ART FROM THE DIVINE
AS DISTANT AS THE DISAGREEMENT IS
'TWIXT EARTH AND HEAVEN'S MOST HIGH AND RAPTUROUS ORB
I NOT REMEMBER I REPLIED THAT E'ER
I WAS ESTRANG'D FROM THEE NOR FOR SUCH FAULT
DOTH CONSCIENCE CHIDE ME SMILING SHE RETURN'D
IF THOU CANST NOT REMEMBER CALL TO MIND
HOW LATELY THOU HAST DRUNK OF LETHE'S WAVE
AND SURE AS SMOKE DOTH INDICATE A FLAME
IN THAT FORGETFULNESS ITSELF CONCLUDE
BLAME FROM THY ALIENATED WILL INCURR'D
FROM HENCEFORTH VERILY MY WORDS SHALL BE
AS NAKED AS WILL SUIT THEM TO APPEAR
IN THY UNPRACTIS'D VIEW MORE SPARKLING NOW
AND WITH RETARDED COURSE THE SUN POSSESS'D
THE CIRCLE OF MID DAY THAT VARIES STILL
AS TH' ASPECT VARIES OF EACH SEVERAL CLIME
WHEN AS ONE SENT IN VAWARD OF A TROOP
FOR ESCORT PAUSES IF PERCHANCE HE SPY
VESTIGE OF SOMEWHAT STRANGE AND RARE SO PAUS'D
THE SEV'NFOLD BAND ARRIVING AT THE VERGE
OF A DUN UMBRAGE HOAR SUCH AS IS SEEN
BENEATH GREEN LEAVES AND GLOOMY BRANCHES OFT
TO OVERBROW A BLEAK AND ALPINE CLIFF
AND WHERE THEY STOOD BEFORE THEM AS IT SEEM'D
TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES BOTH BEHELD
FORTH FROM ONE FOUNTAIN ISSUE AND LIKE FRIENDS
LINGER AT PARTING
O ENLIGHT'NING BEAM
O GLORY OF OUR KIND BESEECH THEE SAY
WHAT WATER THIS WHICH FROM ONE SOURCE DERIV'D
ITSELF REMOVES TO DISTANCE FROM ITSELF
TO SUCH ENTREATY ANSWER THUS WAS MADE
ENTREAT MATILDA THAT SHE TEACH THEE THIS
AND HERE AS ONE WHO CLEARS HIMSELF OF BLAME
IMPUTED THE FAIR DAME RETURN'D OF ME
HE THIS AND MORE HATH LEARNT AND I AM SAFE
THAT LETHE'S WATER HATH NOT HID IT FROM HIM
AND BEATRICE SOME MORE PRESSING CARE
THAT OFT THE MEMORY 'REEVES PERCHANCE HATH MADE
HIS MIND'S EYE DARK
BUT LO WHERE EUNOE COWS
LEAD THITHER AND AS THOU ART WONT REVIVE
HIS FAINTING VIRTUE AS A COURTEOUS SPIRIT
THAT PROFFERS NO EXCUSES BUT AS SOON
AS HE HATH TOKEN OF ANOTHER'S WILL
MAKES IT HIS OWN WHEN SHE HAD TA'EN ME THUS
THE LOVELY MAIDEN MOV'D HER ON AND CALL'D
TO STATIUS WITH AN AIR MOST LADY LIKE
COME THOU WITH HIM WERE FURTHER SPACE ALLOW'D
THEN READER MIGHT I SING THOUGH BUT IN PART
THAT BEVERAGE WITH WHOSE SWEETNESS I HAD NE'ER
BEEN SATED
BUT SINCE ALL THE LEAVES ARE FULL
APPOINTED FOR THIS SECOND STRAIN MINE ART
WITH WARNING BRIDLE CHECKS ME
I RETURN'D
FROM THE MOST HOLY WAVE REGENERATE

CANTOS 1 34
CANTO I
IN THE MIDWAY OF THIS OUR MORTAL LIFE
I FOUND ME IN A GLOOMY WOOD ASTRAY
GONE FROM THE PATH DIRECT AND E'EN TO TELL
IT WERE NO EASY TASK HOW SAVAGE WILD
THAT FOREST HOW ROBUST AND ROUGH ITS GROWTH
WHICH TO REMEMBER ONLY MY DISMAY
RENEWS IN BITTERNESS NOT FAR FROM DEATH
YET TO DISCOURSE OF WHAT THERE GOOD BEFELL
ALL ELSE WILL I RELATE DISCOVER'D THERE
HOW FIRST I ENTER'D IT I SCARCE CAN SAY
SUCH SLEEPY DULLNESS IN THAT INSTANT WEIGH'D
MY SENSES DOWN WHEN THE TRUE PATH I LEFT
BUT WHEN A MOUNTAIN'S FOOT I REACH'D WHERE CLOS'D
THE VALLEY THAT HAD PIERC'D MY HEART WITH DREAD
I LOOK'D ALOFT AND SAW HIS SHOULDERS BROAD
ALREADY VESTED WITH THAT PLANET'S BEAM
WHO LEADS ALL WANDERERS SAFE THROUGH EVERY WAY
THEN WAS A LITTLE RESPITE TO THE FEAR
THAT IN MY HEART'S RECESSES DEEP HAD LAIN
ALL OF THAT NIGHT SO PITIFULLY PASS'D
AND AS A MAN WITH DIFFICULT SHORT BREATH
FORESPENT WITH TOILING 'SCAP'D FROM SEA TO SHORE
TURNS TO THE PERILOUS WIDE WASTE AND STANDS
AT GAZE E'EN SO MY SPIRIT THAT YET FAIL'D
STRUGGLING WITH TERROR TURN'D TO VIEW THE STRAITS
THAT NONE HATH PASS'D AND LIV'D
MY WEARY FRAME
AFTER SHORT PAUSE RECOMFORTED AGAIN
I JOURNEY'D ON OVER THAT LONELY STEEP
THE HINDER FOOT STILL FIRMER
SCARCE THE ASCENT
BEGAN WHEN LO A PANTHER NIMBLE LIGHT
AND COVER'D WITH A SPECKLED SKIN APPEAR'D
NOR WHEN IT SAW ME VANISH'D RATHER STROVE
TO CHECK MY ONWARD GOING THAT OFTTIMES
WITH PURPOSE TO RETRACE MY STEPS I TURN'D
THE HOUR WAS MORNING'S PRIME AND ON HIS WAY
ALOFT THE SUN ASCENDED WITH THOSE STARS
THAT WITH HIM ROSE WHEN LOVE DIVINE FIRST MOV'D
THOSE ITS FAIR WORKS SO THAT WITH JOYOUS HOPE
ALL THINGS CONSPIR'D TO FILL ME THE GAY SKIN
OF THAT SWIFT ANIMAL THE MATIN DAWN
AND THE SWEET SEASON
SOON THAT JOY WAS CHAS'D
AND BY NEW DREAD SUCCEEDED WHEN IN VIEW
A LION CAME 'GAINST ME AS IT APPEAR'D
WITH HIS HEAD HELD ALOFT AND HUNGER MAD
THAT E'EN THE AIR WAS FEAR STRUCK
A SHE WOLF
WAS AT HIS HEELS WHO IN HER LEANNESS SEEM'D
FULL OF ALL WANTS AND MANY A LAND HATH MADE
DISCONSOLATE ERE NOW
SHE WITH SUCH FEAR
O'ERWHELMED ME AT THE SIGHT OF HER APPALL'D
THAT OF THE HEIGHT ALL HOPE I LOST
AS ONE
WHO WITH HIS GAIN ELATED SEES THE TIME
WHEN ALL UNWARES IS GONE HE INWARDLY
MOURNS WITH HEART GRIPING ANGUISH SUCH WAS I
HAUNTED BY THAT FELL BEAST NEVER AT PEACE
WHO COMING O'ER AGAINST ME BY DEGREES
IMPELL'D ME WHERE THE SUN IN SILENCE RESTS
WHILE TO THE LOWER SPACE WITH BACKWARD STEP
I FELL MY KEN DISCERN'D THE FORM ONE OF ONE
WHOSE VOICE SEEM'D FAINT THROUGH LONG DISUSE OF SPEECH
WHEN HIM IN THAT GREAT DESERT I ESPIED
HAVE MERCY ON ME CRIED I OUT ALOUD
SPIRIT OR LIVING MAN WHAT E'ER THOU BE
HE ANSWER'D NOW NOT MAN MAN ONCE I WAS
AND BORN OF LOMBARD PARENTS MANTUANA BOTH
BY COUNTRY WHEN THE POWER OF JULIUS YET
WAS SCARCELY FIRM
AT ROME MY LIFE WAS PAST
BENEATH THE MILD AUGUSTUS IN THE TIME
OF FABLED DEITIES AND FALSE
A BARD
WAS I AND MADE ANCHISES' UPRIGHT SON
THE SUBJECT OF MY SONG WHO CAME FROM TROY
WHEN THE FLAMES PREY'D ON ILIUM'S HAUGHTY TOWERS
BUT THOU SAY WHEREFORE TO SUCH PERILS PAST
RETURN'ST THOU WHEREFORE NOT THIS PLEASANT MOUNT
ASCENDEST CAUSE AND SOURCE OF ALL DELIGHT
AND ART THOU THEN THAT VIRGIL THAT WELL SPRING
FROM WHICH SUCH COPIOUS FLOODS OF ELOQUENCE
HAVE ISSUED I WITH FRONT ABASH'D REPLIED
GLORY AND LIGHT OF ALL THE TUNEFUL TRAIN
MAY IT AVAIL ME THAT I LONG WITH ZEAL
HAVE SOUGHT THY VOLUME AND WITH LOVE IMMENSE
HAVE CONN'D IT O'ER
MY MASTER THOU AND GUIDE
THOU HE FROM WHOM ALONE I HAVE DERIV'D
THAT STYLE WHICH FOR ITS BEAUTY INTO FAME
EXALTS ME
SEE THE BEAST FROM WHOM I FLED
O SAVE ME FROM HER THOU ILLUSTRIOUS SAGE
FOR EVERY VEIN AND PULSE THROUGHOUT MY FRAME
SHE HATH MADE TREMBLE HE SOON AS HE SAW
THAT I WAS WEEPING ANSWER'D THOU MUST NEEDS
ANOTHER WAY PURSUE IF THOU WOULDST 'SCAPE
FROM OUT THAT SAVAGE WILDERNESS
THIS BEAST
AT WHOM THOU CRIEST HER WAY WILL SUFFER NONE
TO PASS AND NO LESS HINDRANCE MAKES THAN DEATH
SO BAD AND SO ACCURSED IN HER KIND
THAT NEVER SATED IS HER RAVENOUS WILL
STILL AFTER FOOD MORE CRAVING THAN BEFORE
TO MANY AN ANIMAL IN WEDLOCK VILE
SHE FASTENS AND SHALL YET TO MANY MORE
UNTIL THAT GREYHOUND COME WHO SHALL DESTROY
HER WITH SHARP PAIN
HE WILL NOT LIFE SUPPORT
BY EARTH NOR ITS BASE METALS BUT BY LOVE
WISDOM AND VIRTUE AND HIS LAND SHALL BE
THE LAND 'TWIXT EITHER FELTRO
IN HIS MIGHT
SHALL SAFETY TO ITALIA'S PLAINS ARISE
FOR WHOSE FAIR REALM CAMILLA VIRGIN PURE
NISUS EURYALUS AND TURNUS FELL
HE WITH INCESSANT CHASE THROUGH EVERY TOWN
SHALL WORRY UNTIL HE TO HELL AT LENGTH
RESTORE HER THENCE BY ENVY FIRST LET LOOSE
I FOR THY PROFIT POND'RING NOW DEVISE
THAT THOU MAYST FOLLOW ME AND I THY GUIDE
WILL LEAD THEE HENCE THROUGH AN ETERNAL SPACE
WHERE THOU SHALT HEAR DESPAIRING SHRIEKS AND SEE
SPIRITS OF OLD TORMENTED WHO INVOKE
A SECOND DEATH AND THOSE NEXT VIEW WHO DWELL
CONTENT IN FIRE FOR THAT THEY HOPE TO COME
WHENE'ER THE TIME MAY BE AMONG THE BLEST
INTO WHOSE REGIONS IF THOU THEN DESIRE
T' ASCEND A SPIRIT WORTHIER THEN I
MUST LEAD THEE IN WHOSE CHARGE WHEN I DEPART
THOU SHALT BE LEFT FOR THAT ALMIGHTY KING
WHO REIGNS ABOVE A REBEL TO HIS LAW
ADJUDGES ME AND THEREFORE HATH DECREED
THAT TO HIS CITY NONE THROUGH ME SHOULD COME
HE IN ALL PARTS HATH SWAY THERE RULES THERE HOLDS
HIS CITADEL AND THRONE
O HAPPY THOSE
WHOM THERE HE CHOOSES I TO HIM IN FEW
BARD BY THAT GOD WHOM THOU DIDST NOT ADORE
I DO BESEECH THEE THAT THIS ILL AND WORSE
I MAY ESCAPE TO LEAD ME WHERE THOU SAIDST
THAT I SAINT PETER'S GATE MAY VIEW AND THOSE
WHO AS THOU TELL'ST ARE IN SUCH DISMAL PLIGHT
ONWARD HE MOV'D I CLOSE HIS STEPS PURSU'D
CANTO II
NOW WAS THE DAY DEPARTING AND THE AIR
IMBROWN'D WITH SHADOWS FROM THEIR TOILS RELEAS'D
ALL ANIMALS ON EARTH AND I ALONE
PREPAR'D MYSELF THE CONFLICT TO SUSTAIN
BOTH OF SAD PITY AND THAT PERILOUS ROAD
WHICH MY UNERRING MEMORY SHALL RETRACE
O MUSES O HIGH GENIUS NOW VOUCHSAFE
YOUR AID O MIND THAT ALL I SAW HAST KEPT
SAFE IN A WRITTEN RECORD HERE THY WORTH
AND EMINENT ENDOWMENTS COME TO PROOF
I THUS BEGAN BARD THOU WHO ART MY GUIDE
CONSIDER WELL IF VIRTUE BE IN ME
SUFFICIENT ERE TO THIS HIGH ENTERPRISE
THOU TRUST ME
THOU HAST TOLD THAT SILVIUS' SIRE
YET CLOTH'D IN CORRUPTIBLE FLESH AMONG
TH' IMMORTAL TRIBES HAD ENTRANCE AND WAS THERE
SENSIBLE PRESENT
YET IF HEAVEN'S GREAT LORD
ALMIGHTY FOE TO ILL SUCH FAVOUR SHEW'D
IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE HIGH EFFECT
BOTH WHAT AND WHO FROM HIM SHOULD ISSUE FORTH
IT SEEMS IN REASON'S JUDGMENT WELL DESERV'D
SITH HE OF ROME AND OF ROME'S EMPIRE WIDE
IN HEAVEN'S EMPYREAL HEIGHT WAS CHOSEN SIRE
BOTH WHICH IF TRUTH BE SPOKEN WERE ORDAIN'D
AND 'STABLISH'D FOR THE HOLY PLACE WHERE SITS
WHO TO GREAT PETER'S SACRED CHAIR SUCCEEDS
HE FROM THIS JOURNEY IN THY SONG RENOWN'D
LEARN'D THINGS THAT TO HIS VICTORY GAVE RISE
AND TO THE PAPAL ROBE
IN AFTER TIMES
THE CHOSEN VESSEL ALSO TRAVEL'D THERE
TO BRING US BACK ASSURANCE IN THAT FAITH
WHICH IS THE ENTRANCE TO SALVATION'S WAY
BUT I WHY SHOULD I THERE PRESUME OR WHO
PERMITS IT NOT AENEAS I NOR PAUL
MYSELF I DEEM NOT WORTHY AND NONE ELSE
WILL DEEM ME
I IF ON THIS VOYAGE THEN
I VENTURE FEAR IT WILL IN FOLLY END
THOU WHO ART WISE BETTER MY MEANING KNOW'ST
THAN I CAN SPEAK AS ONE WHO UNRESOLVES
WHAT HE HATH LATE RESOLV'D AND WITH NEW THOUGHTS
CHANGES HIS PURPOSE FROM HIS FIRST INTENT
REMOV'D E'EN SUCH WAS I ON THAT DUN COAST
WASTING IN THOUGHT MY ENTERPRISE AT FIRST
SO EAGERLY EMBRAC'D
IF RIGHT THY WORDS
I SCAN REPLIED THAT SHADE MAGNANIMOUS
THY SOUL IS BY VILE FEAR ASSAIL'D WHICH OFT
SO OVERCASTS A MAN THAT HE RECOILS
FROM NOBLEST RESOLUTION LIKE A BEAST
AT SOME FALSE SEMBLANCE IN THE TWILIGHT GLOOM
THAT FROM THIS TERROR THOU MAYST FREE THYSELF
I WILL INSTRUCT THEE WHY I CAME AND WHAT
I HEARD IN THAT SAME INSTANT WHEN FOR THEE
GRIEF TOUCH'D ME FIRST
I WAS AMONG THE TRIBE
WHO REST SUSPENDED WHEN A DAME SO BLEST
AND LOVELY I BESOUGHT HER TO COMMAND
CALL'D ME HER EYES WERE BRIGHTER THAN THE STAR
OF DAY AND SHE WITH GENTLE VOICE AND SOFT
ANGELICALLY TUN'D HER SPEECH ADDRESS'D
O COURTEOUS SHADE OF MANTUA THOU WHOSE FAME
YET LIVES AND SHALL LIVE LONG AS NATURE LASTS
A FRIEND NOT OF MY FORTUNE BUT MYSELF
ON THE WIDE DESERT IN HIS ROAD HAS MET
HINDRANCE SO GREAT THAT HE THROUGH FEAR HAS TURN'D
NOW MUCH I DREAD LEST HE PAST HELP HAVE STRAY'D
AND I BE RIS'N TOO LATE FOR HIS RELIEF
FROM WHAT IN HEAVEN OF HIM I HEARD
SPEED NOW
AND BY THY ELOQUENT PERSUASIVE TONGUE
AND BY ALL MEANS FOR HIS DELIVERANCE MEET
ASSIST HIM
SO TO ME WILL COMFORT SPRING
I WHO NOW BID THEE ON THIS ERRAND FORTH
AM BEATRICE FROM A PLACE I COME
NOTE BEATRICE
I USE THIS WORD AS IT IS
PRONOUNCED IN THE ITALIAN AS CONSISTING OF FOUR
SYLLABLES OF WHICH THE THIRD IS A LONG ONE
REVISITED WITH JOY
LOVE BROUGHT ME THENCE
WHO PROMPTS MY SPEECH
WHEN IN MY MASTER'S SIGHT
I STAND THY PRAISE TO HIM I OFT WILL TELL
SHE THEN WAS SILENT AND I THUS BEGAN
O LADY BY WHOSE INFLUENCE ALONE
MANKIND EXCELS WHATEVER IS CONTAIN'D
WITHIN THAT HEAVEN WHICH HATH THE SMALLEST ORB
SO THY COMMAND DELIGHTS ME THAT TO OBEY
IF IT WERE DONE ALREADY WOULD SEEM LATE
NO NEED HAST THOU FARTHER TO SPEAK THY WILL
YET TELL THE REASON WHY THOU ART NOT LOTH
TO LEAVE THAT AMPLE SPACE WHERE TO RETURN
THOU BURNEST FOR THIS CENTRE HERE BENEATH
SHE THEN SINCE THOU SO DEEPLY WOULDST INQUIRE
I WILL INSTRUCT THEE BRIEFLY WHY NO DREAD
HINDERS MY ENTRANCE HERE
THOSE THINGS ALONE
ARE TO BE FEAR'D WHENCE EVIL MAY PROCEED
NONE ELSE FOR NONE ARE TERRIBLE BESIDE
I AM SO FRAM'D BY GOD THANKS TO HIS GRACE
THAT ANY SUFF'RANCE OF YOUR MISERY
TOUCHES ME NOT NOR FLAME OF THAT FIERCE FIRE
ASSAILS ME
IN HIGH HEAVEN A BLESSED DAME
BESIDES WHO MOURNS WITH SUCH EFFECTUAL GRIEF
THAT HINDRANCE WHICH I SEND THEE TO REMOVE
THAT GOD'S STERN JUDGMENT TO HER WILL INCLINES
TO LUCIA CALLING HER SHE THUS BESPAKE
NOW DOTH THY FAITHFUL SERVANT NEED THY AID
AND I COMMEND HIM TO THEE AT HER WORD
SPED LUCIA OF ALL CRUELTY THE FOE
AND COMING TO THE PLACE WHERE I ABODE
SEATED WITH RACHEL HER OF ANCIENT DAYS
SHE THUS ADDRESS'D ME THOU TRUE PRAISE OF GOD
BEATRICE WHY IS NOT THY SUCCOUR LENT
TO HIM WHO SO MUCH LOV'D THEE AS TO LEAVE
FOR THY SAKE ALL THE MULTITUDE ADMIRES
DOST THOU NOT HEAR HOW PITIFUL HIS WAIL
NOR MARK THE DEATH WHICH IN THE TORRENT FLOOD
SWOLN MIGHTIER THAN A SEA HIM STRUGGLING HOLDS
NE'ER AMONG MEN DID ANY WITH SUCH SPEED
HASTE TO THEIR PROFIT FLEE FROM THEIR ANNOY
AS WHEN THESE WORDS WERE SPOKEN I CAME HERE
DOWN FROM MY BLESSED SEAT TRUSTING THE FORCE
OF THY PURE ELOQUENCE WHICH THEE AND ALL
WHO WELL HAVE MARK'D IT INTO HONOUR BRINGS
WHEN SHE HAD ENDED HER BRIGHT BEAMING EYES
TEARFUL SHE TURN'D ASIDE WHEREAT I FELT
REDOUBLED ZEAL TO SERVE THEE
AS SHE WILL'D
THUS AM I COME I SAV'D THEE FROM THE BEAST
WHO THY NEAR WAY ACROSS THE GOODLY MOUNT
PREVENTED
WHAT IS THIS COMES O'ER THEE THEN
WHY WHY DOST THOU HANG BACK WHY IN THY BREAST
HARBOUR VILE FEAR WHY HAST NOT COURAGE THERE
AND NOBLE DARING SINCE THREE MAIDS SO BLEST
THY SAFETY PLAN E'EN IN THE COURT OF HEAVEN
AND SO MUCH CERTAIN GOOD MY WORDS FOREBODE
AS FLORETS BY THE FROSTY AIR OF NIGHT
BENT DOWN AND CLOS'D WHEN DAY HAS BLANCH'D THEIR LEAVES
RISE ALL UNFOLDED ON THEIR SPIRY STEMS
SO WAS MY FAINTING VIGOUR NEW RESTOR'D
AND TO MY HEART SUCH KINDLY COURAGE RAN
THAT I AS ONE UNDAUNTED SOON REPLIED
O FULL OF PITY SHE WHO UNDERTOOK
MY SUCCOUR AND THOU KIND WHO DIDST PERFORM
SO SOON HER TRUE BEHEST WITH SUCH DESIRE
THOU HAST DISPOS'D ME TO RENEW MY VOYAGE
THAT MY FIRST PURPOSE FULLY IS RESUM'D
LEAD ON ONE ONLY WILL IS IN US BOTH
THOU ART MY GUIDE MY MASTER THOU AND LORD
SO SPAKE I AND WHEN HE HAD ONWARD MOV'D
I ENTER'D ON THE DEEP AND WOODY WAY
CANTO III

TO MINE WITH PLEASANT LOOKS WHENCE I WAS CHEER'D
INTO THAT SECRET PLACE HE LED ME ON
HERE SIGHS WITH LAMENTATIONS AND LOUD MOANS
RESOUNDED THROUGH THE AIR PIERC'D BY NO STAR
THAT E'EN I WEPT AT ENTERING
VARIOUS TONGUES
HORRIBLE LANGUAGES OUTCRIES OF WOE
ACCENTS OF ANGER VOICES DEEP AND HOARSE
WITH HANDS TOGETHER SMOTE THAT SWELL'D THE SOUNDS
MADE UP A TUMULT THAT FOR EVER WHIRLS
ROUND THROUGH THAT AIR WITH SOLID DARKNESS STAIN'D

I THEN MASTER WHAT DOTH AGGRIEVE THEM THUS
THAT THEY LAMENT SO LOUD HE STRAIGHT REPLIED
THAT WILL I TELL THEE BRIEFLY
THESE OF DEATH
NO HOPE MAY ENTERTAIN AND THEIR BLIND LIFE
SO MEANLY PASSES THAT ALL OTHER LOTS
THEY ENVY
FAME OF THEM THE WORLD HATH NONE
NOR SUFFERS MERCY AND JUSTICE SCORN THEM BOTH
SPEAK NOT OF THEM BUT LOOK AND PASS THEM BY
AND I WHO STRAIGHTWAY LOOK'D BEHELD A FLAG
WHICH WHIRLING RAN AROUND SO RAPIDLY
THAT IT NO PAUSE OBTAIN'D AND FOLLOWING CAME
SUCH A LONG TRAIN OF SPIRITS I SHOULD NE'ER
HAVE THOUGHT THAT DEATH SO MANY HAD DESPOIL'D
WHEN SOME OF THESE I RECOGNIZ'D I SAW
AND KNEW THE SHADE OF HIM WHO TO BASE FEAR
YIELDING ABJUR'D HIS HIGH ESTATE
FORTHWITH
I UNDERSTOOD FOR CERTAIN THIS THE TRIBE
OF THOSE ILL SPIRITS BOTH TO GOD DISPLEASING
AND TO HIS FOES
THESE WRETCHES WHO NE'ER LIVED
WENT ON IN NAKEDNESS AND SORELY STUNG
BY WASPS AND HORNETS WHICH BEDEW'D THEIR CHEEKS
WITH BLOOD THAT MIX'D WITH TEARS DROPP'D TO THEIR FEET
AND BY DISGUSTFUL WORMS WAS GATHER'D THERE
THEN LOOKING FARTHER ONWARDS I BEHELD
A THRONG UPON THE SHORE OF A GREAT STREAM
WHEREAT I THUS SIR GRANT ME NOW TO KNOW
WHOM HERE WE VIEW AND WHENCE IMPELL'D THEY SEEM
SO EAGER TO PASS O'ER AS I DISCERN
THROUGH THE BLEAR LIGHT HE THUS TO ME IN FEW
THIS SHALT THOU KNOW SOON AS OUR STEPS ARRIVE
BESIDE THE WOEFUL TIDE OF ACHERON
THEN WITH EYES DOWNWARD CAST AND FILL'D WITH SHAME
FEARING MY WORDS OFFENSIVE TO HIS EAR
TILL WE HAD REACH'D THE RIVER I FROM SPEECH
ABSTAIN'D
AND LO TOWARD US IN A BARK
COMES ON AN OLD MAN HOARY WHITE WITH ELD
CRYING WOE TO YOU WICKED SPIRITS HOPE NOT
EVER TO SEE THE SKY AGAIN
I COME
TO TAKE YOU TO THE OTHER SHORE ACROSS
INTO ETERNAL DARKNESS THERE TO DWELL
IN FIERCE HEAT AND IN ICE
AND THOU WHO THERE
STANDEST LIVE SPIRIT GET THEE HENCE AND LEAVE
THESE WHO ARE DEAD BUT SOON AS HE BEHELD
I LEFT THEM NOT BY OTHER WAY SAID HE
BY OTHER HAVEN SHALT THOU COME TO SHORE
NOT BY THIS PASSAGE THEE A NIMBLER BOAT
MUST CARRY THEN TO HIM THUS SPAKE MY GUIDE
CHARON THYSELF TORMENT NOT SO 'T IS WILL'D
WHERE WILL AND POWER ARE ONE ASK THOU NO MORE
STRAIGHTWAY IN SILENCE FELL THE SHAGGY CHEEKS
OF HIM THE BOATMAN O'ER THE LIVID LAKE
AROUND WHOSE EYES GLAR'D WHEELING FLAMES
MEANWHILE
THOSE SPIRITS FAINT AND NAKED COLOR CHANG'D
AND GNASH'D THEIR TEETH SOON AS THE CRUEL WORDS
THEY HEARD
GOD AND THEIR PARENTS THEY BLASPHEM'D
THE HUMAN KIND THE PLACE THE TIME AND SEED
THAT DID ENGENDER THEM AND GIVE THEM BIRTH
THEN ALL TOGETHER SORELY WAILING DREW
TO THE CURS'D STRAND THAT EVERY MAN MUST PASS
WHO FEARS NOT GOD
CHARON DEMONIAC FORM
WITH EYES OF BURNING COAL COLLECTS THEM ALL
BECK'NING AND EACH THAT LINGERS WITH HIS OAR
STRIKES
AS FALL OFF THE LIGHT AUTUMNAL LEAVES
ONE STILL ANOTHER FOLLOWING TILL THE BOUGH
STREWS ALL ITS HONOURS ON THE EARTH BENEATH
E'EN IN LIKE MANNER ADAM'S EVIL BROOD
CAST THEMSELVES ONE BY ONE DOWN FROM THE SHORE
EACH AT A BECK AS FALCON AT HIS CALL
THUS GO THEY OVER THROUGH THE UMBER'D WAVE
AND EVER THEY ON THE OPPOSING BANK
BE LANDED ON THIS SIDE ANOTHER THRONG
STILL GATHERS
SON THUS SPAKE THE COURTEOUS GUIDE
THOSE WHO DIE SUBJECT TO THE WRATH OF GOD
ALL HERE TOGETHER COME FROM EVERY CLIME
AND TO O'ERPASS THE RIVER ARE NOT LOTH
FOR SO HEAVEN'S JUSTICE GOADS THEM ON THAT FEAR
IS TURN'D INTO DESIRE
HENCE NE'ER HATH PAST
GOOD SPIRIT
IF OF THEE CHARON COMPLAIN
NOW MAYST THOU KNOW THE IMPORT OF HIS WORDS
THIS SAID THE GLOOMY REGION TREMBLING SHOOK
SO TERRIBLY THAT YET WITH CLAMMY DEWS
FEAR CHILLS MY BROW
THE SAD EARTH GAVE A BLAST
THAT LIGHTENING SHOT FORTH A VERMILION FLAME
WHICH ALL MY SENSES CONQUER'D QUITE AND I
DOWN DROPP'D AS ONE WITH SUDDEN SLUMBER SEIZ'D
CANTO IV
BROKE THE DEEP SLUMBER IN MY BRAIN A CRASH
OF HEAVY THUNDER THAT I SHOOK MYSELF
AS ONE BY MAIN FORCE ROUS'D
RISEN UPRIGHT
MY RESTED EYES I MOV'D AROUND AND SEARCH'D
WITH FIXED KEN TO KNOW WHAT PLACE IT WAS
WHEREIN I STOOD
FOR CERTAIN ON THE BRINK
I FOUND ME OF THE LAMENTABLE VALE
THE DREAD ABYSS THAT JOINS A THUND'ROUS SOUND
OF PLAINTS INNUMERABLE
DARK AND DEEP
AND THICK WITH CLOUDS O'ERSPREAD MINE EYE IN VAIN
EXPLOR'D ITS BOTTOM NOR COULD AUGHT DISCERN
NOW LET US TO THE BLIND WORLD THERE BENEATH
DESCEND THE BARD BEGAN ALL PALE OF LOOK
I GO THE FIRST AND THOU SHALT FOLLOW NEXT
THEN I HIS ALTER'D HUE PERCEIVING THUS
HOW MAY I SPEED IF THOU YIELDEST TO DREAD
WHO STILL ART WONT TO COMFORT ME IN DOUBT
HE THEN THE ANGUISH OF THAT RACE BELOW
WITH PITY STAINS MY CHEEK WHICH THOU FOR FEAR
MISTAKEST
LET US ON
OUR LENGTH OF WAY
URGES TO HASTE ONWARD THIS SAID HE MOV'D
AND ENT'RING LED ME WITH HIM ON THE BOUNDS
OF THE FIRST CIRCLE THAT SURROUNDS TH' ABYSS
HERE AS MINE EAR COULD NOTE NO PLAINT WAS HEARD
EXCEPT OF SIGHS THAT MADE TH' ETERNAL AIR
TREMBLE NOT CAUS'D BY TORTURES BUT FROM GRIEF
FELT BY THOSE MULTITUDES MANY AND VAST
OF MEN WOMEN AND INFANTS
THEN TO ME
THE GENTLE GUIDE INQUIR'ST THOU NOT WHAT SPIRITS
ARE THESE WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST ERE THOU PASS
FARTHER I WOULD THOU KNOW THAT THESE OF SIN
WERE BLAMELESS AND IF AUGHT THEY MERITED
IT PROFITS NOT SINCE BAPTISM WAS NOT THEIRS
THE PORTAL TO THY FAITH
IF THEY BEFORE
THE GOSPEL LIV'D THEY SERV'D NOT GOD ARIGHT
AND AMONG SUCH AM I
FOR THESE DEFECTS
AND FOR NO OTHER EVIL WE ARE LOST
ONLY SO FAR AFFLICTED THAT WE LIVE
DESIRING WITHOUT HOPE SO GRIEF ASSAIL'D
MY HEART AT HEARING THIS FOR WELL I KNEW
SUSPENDED IN THAT LIMBO MANY A SOUL
OF MIGHTY WORTH
O TELL ME SIRE REVER'D
TELL ME MY MASTER I BEGAN THROUGH WISH
OF FULL ASSURANCE IN THAT HOLY FAITH
WHICH VANQUISHES ALL ERROR SAY DID E'ER
ANY OR THROUGH HIS OWN OR OTHER'S MERIT
COME FORTH FROM THENCE WHOM AFTERWARD WAS BLEST
PIERCING THE SECRET PURPORT OF MY SPEECH
HE ANSWER'D I WAS NEW TO THAT ESTATE
WHEN I BEHELD A PUISSANT ONE ARRIVE
AMONGST US WITH VICTORIOUS TROPHY CROWN'D
HE FORTH THE SHADE OF OUR FIRST PARENT DREW
ABEL HIS CHILD AND NOAH RIGHTEOUS MAN
OF MOSES LAWGIVER FOR FAITH APPROV'D
OF PATRIARCH ABRAHAM AND DAVID KING
ISRAEL WITH HIS SIRE AND WITH HIS SONS
NOR WITHOUT RACHEL WHOM SO HARD HE WON
AND OTHERS MANY MORE WHOM HE TO BLISS
EXALTED
BEFORE THESE BE THOU ASSUR'D
NO SPIRIT OF HUMAN KIND WAS EVER SAV'D
WE WHILE HE SPAKE CEAS'D NOT OUR ONWARD ROAD
STILL PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD FOR SO I NAME
THOSE SPIRITS THICK BESET
WE WERE NOT FAR
ON THIS SIDE FROM THE SUMMIT WHEN I KENN'D
A FLAME THAT O'ER THE DARKEN'D HEMISPHERE
PREVAILING SHIN'D
YET WE A LITTLE SPACE
WERE DISTANT NOT SO FAR BUT I IN PART
DISCOVER'D THAT A TRIBE IN HONOUR HIGH
THAT PLACE POSSESS'D
O THOU WHO EVERY ART
AND SCIENCE VALU'ST WHO ARE THESE THAT BOAST
SUCH HONOUR SEPARATE FROM ALL THE REST
HE ANSWER'D THE RENOWN OF THEIR GREAT NAMES
THAT ECHOES THROUGH YOUR WORLD ABOVE ACQUIRES
FAVOUR IN HEAVEN WHICH HOLDS THEM THUS ADVANC'D
MEANTIME A VOICE I HEARD HONOUR THE BARD
SUBLIME HIS SHADE RETURNS THAT LEFT US LATE
NO SOONER CEAS'D THE SOUND THAN I BEHELD
FOUR MIGHTY SPIRITS TOWARD US BEND THEIR STEPS
OF SEMBLANCE NEITHER SORROWFUL NOR GLAD
WHEN THUS MY MASTER KIND BEGAN MARK HIM
WHO IN HIS RIGHT HAND BEARS THAT FALCHION KEEN
THE OTHER THREE PRECEDING AS THEIR LORD
THIS IS THAT HOMER OF ALL BARDS SUPREME
FLACCUS THE NEXT IN SATIRE'S VEIN EXCELLING
THE THIRD IS NASO LUCAN IS THE LAST
BECAUSE THEY ALL THAT APPELLATION OWN
WITH WHICH THE VOICE SINGLY ACCOSTED ME
HONOURING THEY GREET ME THUS AND WELL THEY JUDGE
SO I BEHELD UNITED THE BRIGHT SCHOOL
OF HIM THE MONARCH OF SUBLIMEST SONG
THAT O'ER THE OTHERS LIKE AN EAGLE SOARS
WHEN THEY TOGETHER SHORT DISCOURSE HAD HELD
THEY TURN'D TO ME WITH SALUTATION KIND
BECK'NING ME AT THE WHICH MY MASTER SMIL'D
NOR WAS THIS ALL BUT GREATER HONOUR STILL
THEY GAVE ME FOR THEY MADE ME OF THEIR TRIBE
AND I WAS SIXTH AMID SO LEARN'D A BAND
FAR AS THE LUMINOUS BEACON ON WE PASS'D
SPEAKING OF MATTERS THEN BEFITTING WELL
TO SPEAK NOW FITTER LEFT UNTOLD
AT FOOT
OF A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE WE ARRIV'D
SEVEN TIMES WITH LOFTY WALLS BEGIRT AND ROUND
DEFENDED BY A PLEASANT STREAM
O'ER THIS
AS O'ER DRY LAND WE PASS'D
NEXT THROUGH SEVEN GATES
I WITH THOSE SAGES ENTER'D AND WE CAME
INTO A MEAD WITH LIVELY VERDURE FRESH
THERE DWELT A RACE WHO SLOW THEIR EYES AROUND
MAJESTICALLY MOV'D AND IN THEIR PORT
BORE EMINENT AUTHORITY THEY SPAKE
SELDOM BUT ALL THEIR WORDS WERE TUNEFUL SWEET
WE TO ONE SIDE RETIR'D INTO A PLACE
OPEN AND BRIGHT AND LOFTY WHENCE EACH ONE
STOOD MANIFEST TO VIEW
INCONTINENT
THERE ON THE GREEN ENAMEL OF THE PLAIN
WERE SHOWN ME THE GREAT SPIRITS BY WHOSE SIGHT
I AM EXALTED IN MY OWN ESTEEM
ELECTRA THERE I SAW ACCOMPANIED
BY MANY AMONG WHOM HECTOR I KNEW
ANCHISES' PIOUS SON AND WITH HAWK'S EYE
CAESAR ALL ARM'D AND BY CAMILLA THERE
PENTHESILEA
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OLD KING LATINUS SEATED BY HIS CHILD
LAVINIA AND THAT BRUTUS I BEHELD
WHO TARQUIN CHAS'D LUCRETIA CATO'S WIFE
MARCIA WITH JULIA AND CORNELIA THERE
AND SOLE APART RETIR'D THE SOLDAN FIERCE
THEN WHEN A LITTLE MORE I RAIS'D MY BROW
I SPIED THE MASTER OF THE SAPIENT THRONG
SEATED AMID THE PHILOSOPHIC TRAIN
HIM ALL ADMIRE ALL PAY HIM REV'RENCE DUE
THERE SOCRATES AND PLATO BOTH I MARK'D
NEAREST TO HIM IN RANK DEMOCRITUS
WHO SETS THE WORLD AT CHANCE DIOGENES
WITH HERACLITUS AND EMPEDOCLES
AND ANAXAGORAS AND THALES SAGE
ZENO AND DIOSCORIDES WELL READ
IN NATURE'S SECRET LORE
ORPHEUS I MARK'D
AND LINUS TULLY AND MORAL SENECA
EUCLID AND PTOLEMY HIPPOCRATES
GALENUS AVICEN AND HIM WHO MADE
THAT COMMENTARY VAST AVERROES
OF ALL TO SPEAK AT FULL WERE VAIN ATTEMPT
FOR MY WIDE THEME SO URGES THAT OFTTIMES
MY WORDS FALL SHORT OF WHAT BECHANC'D
IN TWO
THE SIX ASSOCIATES PART
ANOTHER WAY
MY SAGE GUIDE LEADS ME FROM THAT AIR SERENE
INTO A CLIMATE EVER VEX'D WITH STORMS
AND TO A PART I COME WHERE NO LIGHT SHINES
CANTO V
FROM THE FIRST CIRCLE I DESCENDED THUS
DOWN TO THE SECOND WHICH A LESSER SPACE
EMBRACING SO MUCH MORE OF GRIEF CONTAINS
PROVOKING BITTER MOANS
THERE MINOS STANDS
GRINNING WITH GHASTLY FEATURE HE OF ALL
WHO ENTER STRICT EXAMINING THE CRIMES
GIVES SENTENCE AND DISMISSES THEM BENEATH
ACCORDING AS HE FOLDETH HIM AROUND
FOR WHEN BEFORE HIM COMES TH' ILL FATED SOUL
IT ALL CONFESSES AND THAT JUDGE SEVERE
OF SINS CONSIDERING WHAT PLACE IN HELL
SUITS THE TRANSGRESSION WITH HIS TAIL SO OFT
HIMSELF ENCIRCLES AS DEGREES BENEATH
HE DOOMS IT TO DESCEND
BEFORE HIM STAND
ALWAYS A NUM'ROUS THRONG AND IN HIS TURN
EACH ONE TO JUDGMENT PASSING SPEAKS AND HEARS
HIS FATE THENCE DOWNWARD TO HIS DWELLING HURL'D
O THOU WHO TO THIS RESIDENCE OF WOE
APPROACHEST WHEN HE SAW ME COMING CRIED
MINOS RELINQUISHING HIS DREAD EMPLOY
LOOK HOW THOU ENTER HERE BEWARE IN WHOM
THOU PLACE THY TRUST LET NOT THE ENTRANCE BROAD
DECEIVE THEE TO THY HARM TO HIM MY GUIDE
WHEREFORE EXCLAIMEST HINDER NOT HIS WAY
BY DESTINY APPOINTED SO 'TIS WILL'D
WHERE WILL AND POWER ARE ONE
ASK THOU NO MORE
NOW 'GIN THE RUEFUL WAILINGS TO BE HEARD
NOW AM I COME WHERE MANY A PLAINING VOICE
SMITES ON MINE EAR
INTO A PLACE I CAME
WHERE LIGHT WAS SILENT ALL
BELLOWING THERE GROAN'D
A NOISE AS OF A SEA IN TEMPEST TORN
BY WARRING WINDS
THE STORMY BLAST OF HELL
WITH RESTLESS FURY DRIVES THE SPIRITS ON
WHIRL'D ROUND AND DASH'D AMAIN WITH SORE ANNOY
WHEN THEY ARRIVE BEFORE THE RUINOUS SWEEP
THERE SHRIEKS ARE HEARD THERE LAMENTATIONS MOANS
AND BLASPHEMIES 'GAINST THE GOOD POWER IN HEAVEN
I UNDERSTOOD THAT TO THIS TORMENT SAD
THE CARNAL SINNERS ARE CONDEMN'D IN WHOM
REASON BY LUST IS SWAY'D
AS IN LARGE TROOPS
AND MULTITUDINOUS WHEN WINTER REIGNS
THE STARLINGS ON THEIR WINGS ARE BORNE ABROAD
SO BEARS THE TYRANNOUS GUST THOSE EVIL SOULS
ON THIS SIDE AND ON THAT ABOVE BELOW
IT DRIVES THEM HOPE OF REST TO SOLACE THEM
IS NONE NOR E'EN OF MILDER PANG
AS CRANES
CHANTING THEIR DOL'ROUS NOTES TRAVERSE THE SKY
STRETCH'D OUT IN LONG ARRAY SO I BEHELD
SPIRITS WHO CAME LOUD WAILING HURRIED ON
BY THEIR DIRE DOOM
THEN I INSTRUCTOR WHO
ARE THESE BY THE BLACK AIR SO SCOURG'D THE FIRST
'MONG THOSE OF WHOM THOU QUESTION'ST HE REPLIED
O'ER MANY TONGUES WAS EMPRESS
SHE IN VICE
OF LUXURY WAS SO SHAMELESS THAT SHE MADE
LIKING BE LAWFUL BY PROMULG'D DECREE
TO CLEAR THE BLAME SHE HAD HERSELF INCURR'D
THIS IS SEMIRAMIS OF WHOM 'TIS WRIT
THAT SHE SUCCEEDED NINUS HER ESPOUS'D
AND HELD THE LAND WHICH NOW THE SOLDAN RULES
THE NEXT IN AMOROUS FURY SLEW HERSELF
AND TO SICHEUS' ASHES BROKE HER FAITH
THEN FOLLOWS CLEOPATRA LUSTFUL QUEEN
THERE MARK'D I HELEN FOR WHOSE SAKE SO LONG
THE TIME WAS FRAUGHT WITH EVIL THERE THE GREAT
ACHILLES WHO WITH LOVE FOUGHT TO THE END
PARIS I SAW AND TRISTAN AND BESIDE
A THOUSAND MORE HE SHOW'D ME AND BY NAME
POINTED THEM OUT WHOM LOVE BEREAV'D OF LIFE
WHEN I HAD HEARD MY SAGE INSTRUCTOR NAME
THOSE DAMES AND KNIGHTS OF ANTIQUE DAYS O'ERPOWER'D
BY PITY WELL NIGH IN AMAZE MY MIND
WAS LOST AND I BEGAN BARD WILLINGLY
I WOULD ADDRESS THOSE TWO TOGETHER COMING
WHICH SEEM SO LIGHT BEFORE THE WIND HE THUS
NOTE THOU WHEN NEARER THEY TO US APPROACH
THEN BY THAT LOVE WHICH CARRIES THEM ALONG
ENTREAT AND THEY WILL COME SOON AS THE WIND
SWAY'D THEM TOWARD US I THUS FRAM'D MY SPEECH
O WEARIED SPIRITS COME AND HOLD DISCOURSE
WITH US IF BY NONE ELSE RESTRAIN'D AS DOVES
BY FOND DESIRE INVITED ON WIDE WINGS
AND FIRM TO THEIR SWEET NEST RETURNING HOME

IF FOR A FRIEND THE KING OF ALL WE OWN'D
OUR PRAY'R TO HIM SHOULD FOR THY PEACE ARISE
SINCE THOU HAST PITY ON OUR EVIL PLIGHT
F WHATSOE'ER TO HEAR OR TO DISCOURSE
IT PLEASES THEE THAT WILL WE HEAR OF THAT
FREELY WITH THEE DISCOURSE WHILE E'ER THE WIND
AS NOW IS MUTE
THE LAND THAT GAVE ME BIRTH
IS SITUATE ON THE COAST WHERE PO DESCENDS
TO REST IN OCEAN WITH HIS SEQUENT STREAMS
LOVE THAT IN GENTLE HEART IS QUICKLY LEARNT
ENTANGLED HIM BY THAT FAIR FORM FROM ME
TA'EN IN SUCH CRUEL SORT AS GRIEVES ME STILL
LOVE THAT DENIAL TAKES FROM NONE BELOV'D
CAUGHT ME WITH PLEASING HIM SO PASSING WELL
THAT AS THOU SEE'ST HE YET DESERTS ME NOT
LOVE BROUGHT US TO ONE DEATH CAINA WAITS
THE SOUL WHO SPILT OUR LIFE SUCH WERE THEIR WORDS
AT HEARING WHICH DOWNWARD I BENT MY LOOKS
AND HELD THEM THERE SO LONG THAT THE BARD CRIED
WHAT ART THOU POND'RING I IN ANSWER THUS
ALAS BY WHAT SWEET THOUGHTS WHAT FOND DESIRE
MUST THEY AT LENGTH TO THAT ILL PASS HAVE REACH'D
THEN TURNING I TO THEM MY SPEECH ADDRESS'D
AND THUS BEGAN FRANCESCA YOUR SAD FATE
EVEN TO TEARS MY GRIEF AND PITY MOVES
BUT TELL ME IN THE TIME OF YOUR SWEET SIGHS
BY WHAT AND HOW LOVE GRANTED THAT YE KNEW
YOUR YET UNCERTAIN WISHES SHE REPLIED
NO GREATER GRIEF THAN TO REMEMBER DAYS
OF JOY WHEN MIS'RY IS AT HAND THAT KENS
THY LEARN'D INSTRUCTOR
YET SO EAGERLY
IF THOU ART BENT TO KNOW THE PRIMAL ROOT
FROM WHENCE OUR LOVE GAT BEING I WILL DO
AS ONE WHO WEEPS AND TELLS HIS TALE
ONE DAY
FOR OUR DELIGHT WE READ OF LANCELOT
HOW HIM LOVE THRALL'D
ALONE WE WERE AND NO
SUSPICION NEAR US
OFTTIMES BY THAT READING
OUR EYES WERE DRAWN TOGETHER AND THE HUE
FLED FROM OUR ALTER'D CHEEK
BUT AT ONE POINT
ALONE WE FELL
WHEN OF THAT SMILE WE READ
THE WISHED SMILE RAPTUROUSLY KISS'D
BY ONE SO DEEP IN LOVE THEN HE WHO NE'ER
FROM ME SHALL SEPARATE AT ONCE MY LIPS
ALL TREMBLING KISS'D
THE BOOK AND WRITER BOTH
WERE LOVE'S PURVEYORS
IN ITS LEAVES THAT DAY
WE READ NO MORE WHILE THUS ONE SPIRIT SPAKE
THE OTHER WAIL'D SO SORELY THAT HEARTSTRUCK
I THROUGH COMPASSION FAINTING SEEM'D NOT FAR
FROM DEATH AND LIKE A CORPSE FELL TO THE GROUND
CANTO VI
MY SENSE REVIVING THAT EREWHILE HAD DROOP'D
WITH PITY FOR THE KINDRED SHADES WHENCE GRIEF
O'ERCAME ME WHOLLY STRAIGHT AROUND I SEE
NEW TORMENTS NEW TORMENTED SOULS WHICH WAY
SOE'ER I MOVE OR TURN OR BEND MY SIGHT
IN THE THIRD CIRCLE I ARRIVE OF SHOW'RS
CEASELESS ACCURSED HEAVY AND COLD UNCHANG'D
FOR EVER BOTH IN KIND AND IN DEGREE
LARGE HAIL DISCOLOUR'D WATER SLEETY FLAW
THROUGH THE DUN MIDNIGHT AIR STREAM'D DOWN AMAIN
STANK ALL THE LAND WHEREON THAT TEMPEST FELL
CERBERUS CRUEL MONSTER FIERCE AND STRANGE
THROUGH HIS WIDE THREEFOLD THROAT BARKS AS A DOG
OVER THE MULTITUDE IMMERS'D BENEATH
HIS EYES GLARE CRIMSON BLACK HIS UNCTUOUS BEARD
HIS BELLY LARGE AND CLAW'D THE HANDS WITH WHICH
HE TEARS THE SPIRITS FLAYS THEM AND THEIR LIMBS
PIECEMEAL DISPARTS
HOWLING THERE SPREAD AS CURS
UNDER THE RAINY DELUGE WITH ONE SIDE
THE OTHER SCREENING OFT THEY ROLL THEM ROUND
A WRETCHED GODLESS CREW
WHEN THAT GREAT WORM
DESCRIED US SAVAGE CERBERUS HE OP'D
HIS JAWS AND THE FANGS SHOW'D US NOT A LIMB
OF HIM BUT TREMBLED
THEN MY GUIDE HIS PALMS
EXPANDING ON THE GROUND THENCE FILLED WITH EARTH
RAIS'D THEM AND CAST IT IN HIS RAVENOUS MAW
E'EN AS A DOG THAT YELLING BAYS FOR FOOD
HIS KEEPER WHEN THE MORSEL COMES LETS FALL
HIS FURY BENT ALONE WITH EAGER HASTE
TO SWALLOW IT SO DROPP'D THE LOATHSOME CHEEKS
OF DEMON CERBERUS WHO THUND'RING STUNS
THE SPIRITS THAT THEY FOR DEAFNESS WISH IN VAIN
WE O'ER THE SHADES THROWN PROSTRATE BY THE BRUNT
OF THE HEAVY TEMPEST PASSING SET OUR FEET
UPON THEIR EMPTINESS THAT SUBSTANCE SEEM'D
THEY ALL ALONG THE EARTH EXTENDED LAY
SAVE ONE THAT SUDDEN RAIS'D HIMSELF TO SIT
SOON AS THAT WAY HE SAW US PASS
O THOU

BUT TELL ME IF THOU KNOW'ST
WHAT SHALL AT LENGTH BEFALL THE CITIZENS
OF THE DIVIDED CITY WHETHER ANY JUST ONE
INHABIT THERE AND TELL ME OF THE CAUSE
WHENCE JARRING DISCORD HATH ASSAIL'D IT THUS
HE THEN AFTER LONG STRIVING THEY WILL COME
TO BLOOD AND THE WILD PARTY FROM THE WOODS
WILL CHASE THE OTHER WITH MUCH INJURY FORTH
THEN IT BEHOVES THAT THIS MUST FALL WITHIN
THREE SOLAR CIRCLES AND THE OTHER RISE
BY BORROW'D FORCE OF ONE WHO UNDER SHORE
NOW RESTS
IT SHALL A LONG SPACE HOLD ALOOF
ITS FOREHEAD KEEPING UNDER HEAVY WEIGHT
THE OTHER OPPRESS'D INDIGNANT AT THE LOAD
AND GRIEVING SORE
THE JUST ARE TWO IN NUMBER
BUT THEY NEGLECTED
AV'RICE ENVY PRIDE
THREE FATAL SPARKS HAVE SET THE HEARTS OF ALL
ON FIRE HERE CEAS'D THE LAMENTABLE SOUND
AND I CONTINU'D THUS STILL WOULD I LEARN
MORE FROM THEE FARTHER PARLEY STILL ENTREAT
OF FARINATA AND TEGGHIAIO SAY
THEY WHO SO WELL DESERV'D OF GIACOPO
ARRIGO MOSCA AND THE REST WHO BENT

RESUME HIS FLESHLY VESTURE AND HIS FORM
AND HEAR THE ETERNAL DOOM RE ECHOING REND
THE VAULT SO PASS'D WE THROUGH THAT MIXTURE FOUL
OF SPIRITS AND RAIN WITH TARDY STEPS MEANWHILE
TOUCHING THOUGH SLIGHTLY ON THE LIFE TO COME
FOR THUS I QUESTION'D SHALL THESE TORTURES SIR
WHEN THE GREAT SENTENCE PASSES BE INCREAS'D
OR MITIGATED OR AS NOW SEVERE
HE THEN CONSULT THY KNOWLEDGE THAT DECIDES
THAT AS EACH THING TO MORE PERFECTION GROWS
IT FEELS MORE SENSIBLY BOTH GOOD AND PAIN
THOUGH NE'ER TO TRUE PERFECTION MAY ARRIVE
THIS RACE ACCURS'D YET NEARER THEN THAN NOW
THEY SHALL APPROACH IT COMPASSING THAT PATH
CIRCUITOUS WE JOURNEYED AND DISCOURSE
MUCH MORE THAN I RELATE BETWEEN US PASS'D
TILL AT THE POINT WHERE THE STEPS LED BELOW
ARRIV'D THERE PLUTUS THE GREAT FOE WE FOUND
CANTO VII

THEN TO THAT SWORN LIP TURNING PEACE HE CRIED
CURS'D WOLF THY FURY INWARD ON THYSELF
PREY AND CONSUME THEE THROUGH THE DARK PROFOUND
NOT WITHOUT CAUSE HE PASSES
SO 'T IS WILL'D
ON HIGH THERE WHERE THE GREAT ARCHANGEL POUR'D
HEAV'N'S VENGEANCE ON THE FIRST ADULTERER PROUD

THUS WE DESCENDING TO THE FOURTH STEEP LEDGE
GAIN'D ON THE DISMAL SHORE THAT ALL THE WOE
HEMS IN OF ALL THE UNIVERSE
AH ME
ALMIGHTY JUSTICE IN WHAT STORE THOU HEAP'ST
NEW PAINS NEW TROUBLES AS I HERE BEHELD
WHEREFORE DOTH FAULT OF OURS BRING US TO THIS
E'EN AS A BILLOW ON CHARYBDIS RISING
AGAINST ENCOUNTER'D BILLOW DASHING BREAKS
SUCH IS THE DANCE THIS WRETCHED RACE MUST LEAD
WHOM MORE THAN ELSEWHERE NUMEROUS HERE I FOUND
FROM ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER WITH LOUD VOICE
BOTH ROLL'D ON WEIGHTS BY MAIN FORGE OF THEIR BREASTS
THEN SMOTE TOGETHER AND EACH ONE FORTHWITH
ROLL'D THEM BACK VOLUBLE TURNING AGAIN
EXCLAIMING THESE WHY HOLDEST THOU SO FAST
THOSE ANSWERING AND WHY CASTEST THOU AWAY
SO STILL REPEATING THEIR DESPITEFUL SONG
THEY TO THE OPPOSITE POINT ON EITHER HAND
TRAVERS'D THE HORRID CIRCLE THEN ARRIV'D
BOTH TURN'D THEM ROUND AND THROUGH THE MIDDLE SPACE
CONFLICTING MET AGAIN
AT SIGHT WHEREOF
I STUNG WITH GRIEF THUS SPAKE O SAY MY GUIDE
WHAT RACE IS THIS WERE THESE WHOSE HEADS ARE SHORN
ON OUR LEFT HAND ALL SEP'RATE TO THE CHURCH
HE STRAIGHT REPLIED IN THEIR FIRST LIFE THESE ALL
IN MIND WERE SO DISTORTED THAT THEY MADE
ACCORDING TO DUE MEASURE OF THEIR WEALTH
NO USE
THIS CLEARLY FROM THEIR WORDS COLLECT
WHICH THEY HOWL FORTH AT EACH EXTREMITY
ARRIVING OF THE CIRCLE WHERE THEIR CRIME
CONTRARY' IN KIND DISPARTS THEM
TO THE CHURCH
WERE SEPARATE THOSE THAT WITH NO HAIRY COWLS
ARE CROWN'D BOTH POPES AND CARDINALS O'ER WHOM
AV'RICE DOMINION ABSOLUTE MAINTAINS
I THEN MID SUCH AS THESE SOME NEEDS MUST BE
WHOM I SHALL RECOGNIZE THAT WITH THE BLOT
OF THESE FOUL SINS WERE STAIN'D HE ANSWERING THUS
VAIN THOUGHT CONCEIV'ST THOU
THAT IGNOBLE LIFE
WHICH MADE THEM VILE BEFORE NOW MAKES THEM DARK
AND TO ALL KNOWLEDGE INDISCERNIBLE
FOREVER THEY SHALL MEET IN THIS RUDE SHOCK
THESE FROM THE TOMB WITH CLENCHED GRASP SHALL RISE
THOSE WITH CLOSE SHAVEN LOCKS
THAT ILL THEY GAVE
AND ILL THEY KEPT HATH OF THE BEAUTEOUS WORLD
DEPRIV'D AND SET THEM AT THIS STRIFE WHICH NEEDS
NO LABOUR'D PHRASE OF MINE TO SET IF OFF
NOW MAY'ST THOU SEE MY SON HOW BRIEF HOW VAIN
THE GOODS COMMITTED INTO FORTUNE'S HANDS
FOR WHICH THE HUMAN RACE KEEP SUCH A COIL

TO GUIDE THEM SO THAT EACH PART SHINES TO EACH
THEIR LIGHT IN EQUAL DISTRIBUTION POUR'D
BY SIMILAR APPOINTMENT HE ORDAIN'D
OVER THE WORLD'S BRIGHT IMAGES TO RULE
SUPERINTENDENCE OF A GUIDING HAND
AND GENERAL MINISTER WHICH AT DUE TIME
MAY CHANGE THE EMPTY VANTAGES OF LIFE
FROM RACE TO RACE FROM ONE TO OTHER'S BLOOD
BEYOND PREVENTION OF MAN'S WISEST CARE
WHEREFORE ONE NATION RISES INTO SWAY
ANOTHER LANGUISHES E'EN AS HER WILL
DECREES FROM US CONCEAL'D AS IN THE GRASS
THE SERPENT TRAIN
AGAINST HER NOUGHT AVAILS
YOUR UTMOST WISDOM
SHE WITH FORESIGHT PLANS
JUDGES AND CARRIES ON HER REIGN AS THEIRS
THE OTHER POWERS DIVINE
HER CHANGES KNOW
NORE INTERMISSION BY NECESSITY
SHE IS MADE SWIFT SO FREQUENT COME WHO CLAIM
SUCCESSION IN HER FAVOURS
THIS IS SHE
SO EXECRATED E'EN BY THOSE WHOSE DEBT
TO HER IS RATHER PRAISE THEY WRONGFULLY
WITH BLAME REQUITE HER AND WITH EVIL WORD
BUT SHE IS BLESSED AND FOR THAT RECKS NOT
AMIDST THE OTHER PRIMAL BEINGS GLAD
ROLLS ON HER SPHERE AND IN HER BLISS EXULTS
NOW ON OUR WAY PASS WE TO HEAVIER WOE
DESCENDING FOR EACH STAR IS FALLING NOW
THAT MOUNTED AT OUR ENTRANCE AND FORBIDS
TOO LONG OUR TARRYING WE THE CIRCLE CROSS'D
TO THE NEXT STEEP ARRIVING AT A WELL
THAT BOILING POURS ITSELF DOWN TO A FOSS
SLUIC'D FROM ITS SOURCE
FAR MURKIER WAS THE WAVE
THAN SABLEST GRAIN AND WE IN COMPANY
OF THE' INKY WATERS JOURNEYING BY THEIR SIDE
ENTER'D THOUGH BY A DIFFERENT TRACK BENEATH
INTO A LAKE THE STYGIAN NAM'D EXPANDS
THE DISMAL STREAM WHEN IT HATH REACH'D THE FOOT
OF THE GREY WITHER'D CLIFFS
INTENT I STOOD
TO GAZE AND IN THE MARISH SUNK DESCRIED
A MIRY TRIBE ALL NAKED AND WITH LOOKS
BETOK'NING RAGE
THEY WITH THEIR HANDS ALONE
STRUCK NOT BUT WITH THE HEAD THE BREAST THE FEET
CUTTING EACH OTHER PIECEMEAL WITH THEIR FANGS
THE GOOD INSTRUCTOR SPAKE NOW SEEST THOU SON
THE SOULS OF THOSE WHOM ANGER OVERCAME
THIS TOO FOR CERTAIN KNOW THAT UNDERNEATH
THE WATER DWELLS A MULTITUDE WHOSE SIGHS
INTO THESE BUBBLES MAKE THE SURFACE HEAVE
AS THINE EYE TELLS THEE WHERESOE'ER IT TURN
FIX'D IN THE SLIME THEY SAY SAD ONCE WERE WE
IN THE SWEET AIR MADE GLADSOME BY THE SUN
CARRYING A FOUL AND LAZY MIST WITHIN
NOW IN THESE MURKY SETTLINGS ARE WE SAD
SUCH DOLOROUS STRAIN THEY GURGLE IN THEIR THROATS
BUT WORD DISTINCT CAN UTTER NONE OUR ROUTE
THUS COMPASS'D WE A SEGMENT WIDELY STRETCH'D
BETWEEN THE DRY EMBANKMENT AND THE CORE
OF THE LOATH'D POOL TURNING MEANWHILE OUR EYES
DOWNWARD ON THOSE WHO GULP'D ITS MUDDY LEES
NOR STOPP'D TILL TO A TOWER'S LOW BASE WE CAME
CANTO VIII
MY THEME PURSUING I RELATE THAT ERE
WE REACH'D THE LOFTY TURRET'S BASE OUR EYES
ITS HEIGHT ASCENDED WHERE TWO CRESSETS HUNG
WE MARK'D AND FROM AFAR ANOTHER LIGHT
RETURN THE SIGNAL SO REMOTE THAT SCARCE
THE EYE COULD CATCH ITS BEAM
I TURNING ROUND
TO THE DEEP SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE THUS INQUIR'D
SAY WHAT THIS MEANS AND WHAT THAT OTHER LIGHT
IN ANSWER SET WHAT AGENCY DOTH THIS
THERE ON THE FILTHY WATERS HE REPLIED
E'EN NOW WHAT NEXT AWAITS US MAYST THOU SEE
IF THE MARSH GENDER'D FOG CONCEAL IT NOT
NEVER WAS ARROW FROM THE CORD DISMISS'D
THAT RAN ITS WAY SO NIMBLY THROUGH THE AIR
AS A SMALL BARK THAT THROUGH THE WAVES I SPIED
TOWARD US COMING UNDER THE SOLE SWAY
OF ONE THAT FERRIED IT WHO CRIED ALOUD
ART THOU ARRIV'D FELL SPIRIT PHLEGYAS PHLEGYAS
THIS TIME THOU CRIEST IN VAIN MY LORD REPLIED
NO LONGER SHALT THOU HAVE US BUT WHILE O'ER
THE SLIMY POOL WE PASS AS ONE WHO HEARS
OF SOME GREAT WRONG HE HATH SUSTAIN'D WHEREAT
INLY HE PINES SO PHLEGYAS INLY PIN'D
IN HIS FIERCE IRE
MY GUIDE DESCENDING STEPP'D
INTO THE SKIFF AND BADE ME ENTER NEXT
CLOSE AT HIS SIDE NOR TILL MY ENTRANCE SEEM'D
THE VESSEL FREIGHTED
SOON AS BOTH EMBARK'D
CUTTING THE WAVES GOES ON THE ANCIENT PROW
MORE DEEPLY THAN WITH OTHERS IT IS WONT
WHILE WE OUR COURSE O'ER THE DEAD CHANNEL HELD
ONE DRENCH'D IN MIRE BEFORE ME CAME AND SAID
WHO ART THOU THAT THOU COMEST ERE THINE HOUR
I ANSWER'D THOUGH I COME I TARRY NOT
BUT WHO ART THOU THAT ART BECOME SO FOUL
ONE AS THOU SEEST WHO MOURN HE STRAIGHT REPLIED
TO WHICH I THUS IN MOURNING AND IN WOE
CURS'D SPIRIT TARRY THOU G I KNOW THEE WELL
E'EN THUS IN FILTH DISGUIS'D THEN STRETCH'D HE FORTH
HANDS TO THE BARK WHEREOF MY TEACHER SAGE
AWARE THRUSTING HIM BACK AWAY DOWN THERE
TO THE' OTHER DOGS THEN WITH HIS ARMS MY NECK
ENCIRCLING KISS'D MY CHEEK AND SPAKE O SOUL
JUSTLY DISDAINFUL BLEST WAS SHE IN WHOM
THOU WAS CONCEIV'D HE IN THE WORLD WAS ONE
FOR ARROGANCE NOTED TO HIS MEMORY
NO VIRTUE LENDS ITS LUSTRE EVEN SO
HERE IS HIS SHADOW FURIOUS
THERE ABOVE
HOW MANY NOW HOLD THEMSELVES MIGHTY KINGS
WHO HERE LIKE SWINE SHALL WALLOW IN THE MIRE
LEAVING BEHIND THEM HORRIBLE DISPRAISE
I THEN MASTER HIM FAIN WOULD I BEHOLD
WHELM'D IN THESE DREGS BEFORE WE QUIT THE LAKE
HE THUS OR EVER TO THY VIEW THE SHORE
BE OFFER'D SATISFIED SHALL BE THAT WISH
WHICH WELL DESERVES COMPLETION SCARCE HIS WORDS
WERE ENDED WHEN I SAW THE MIRY TRIBES
SET ON HIM WITH SUCH VIOLENCE THAT YET
FOR THAT RENDER I THANKS TO GOD AND PRAISE
TO FILIPPO ARGENTI CRIED THEY ALL
AND ON HIMSELF THE MOODY FLORENTINE
TURN'D HIS AVENGING FANGS
HIM HERE WE LEFT
NOR SPEAK I OF HIM MORE
BUT ON MINE EAR
SUDDEN A SOUND OF LAMENTATION SMOTE
WHEREAT MINE EYE UNBARR'D I SENT ABROAD
AND THUS THE GOOD INSTRUCTOR NOW MY SON
DRAWS NEAR THE CITY THAT OF DIS IS NAM'D
WITH ITS GRAVE DENIZENS A MIGHTY THRONG
I THUS THE MINARETS ALREADY SIR
THERE CERTES IN THE VALLEY I DESCRY
GLEAMING VERMILION AS IF THEY FROM FIRE
HAD ISSU'D HE REPLIED ETERNAL FIRE
THAT INWARD BURNS SHOWS THEM WITH RUDDY FLAME
ILLUM'D AS IN THIS NETHER HELL THOU SEEST
WE CAME WITHIN THE FOSSES DEEP THAT MOAT
THIS REGION COMFORTLESS
THE WALLS APPEAR'D
AS THEY WERE FRAM'D OF IRON
WE HAD MADE
WIDE CIRCUIT ERE A PLACE WE REACH'D WHERE LOUD
THE MARINER CRIED VEHEMENT GO FORTH
THE' ENTRANCE IS HERE UPON THE GATES I SPIED
MORE THAN A THOUSAND WHO OF OLD FROM HEAVEN
WERE HURL'D
WITH IREFUL GESTURES WHO IS THIS
THEY CRIED THAT WITHOUT DEATH FIRST FELT GOES THROUGH
THE REGIONS OF THE DEAD MY SAPIENT GUIDE
MADE SIGN THAT HE FOR SECRET PARLEY WISH'D
WHEREAT THEIR ANGRY SCORN ABATING THUS
THEY SPAKE COME THOU ALONE AND LET HIM GO
WHO HATH SO HARDILY ENTER'D THIS REALM
ALONE RETURN HE BY HIS WITLESS WAY
IF WELL HE KNOW IT LET HIM PROVE
FOR THEE
HERE SHALT THOU TARRY WHO THROUGH CLIME SO DARK
HAST BEEN HIS ESCORT NOW BETHINK THEE READER
WHAT CHEER WAS MINE AT SOUND OF THOSE CURS'D WORDS
I DID BELIEVE I NEVER SHOULD RETURN
O MY LOV'D GUIDE WHO MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES
SECURITY HAST RENDER'D ME AND DRAWN
FROM PERIL DEEP WHERETO I STOOD EXPOS'D
DESERT ME NOT I CRIED IN THIS EXTREME
AND IF OUR ONWARD GOING BE DENIED
TOGETHER TRACE WE BACK OUR STEPS WITH SPEED
MY LIEGE WHO THITHER HAD CONDUCTED ME
REPLIED FEAR NOT FOR OF OUR PASSAGE NONE
HATH POWER TO DISAPPOINT US BY SUCH HIGH
AUTHORITY PERMITTED
BUT DO THOU
EXPECT ME HERE MEANWHILE THY WEARIED SPIRIT
COMFORT AND FEED WITH KINDLY HOPE ASSUR'D
I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE IN THIS LOWER WORLD
THIS SAID DEPARTS THE SIRE BENEVOLENT
AND QUITS ME
HESITATING I REMAIN
AT WAR 'TWIXT WILL AND WILL NOT IN MY THOUGHTS
I COULD NOT HEAR WHAT TERMS HE OFFER'D THEM
BUT THEY CONFERR'D NOT LONG FOR ALL AT ONCE
TO TRIAL FLED WITHIN
CLOS'D WERE THE GATES
BY THOSE OUR ADVERSARIES ON THE BREAST
OF MY LIEGE LORD EXCLUDED HE RETURN'D
TO ME WITH TARDY STEPS
UPON THE GROUND
HIS EYES WERE BENT AND FROM HIS BROW ERAS'D
ALL CONFIDENCE WHILE THUS WITH SIGHS HE SPAKE
WHO HATH DENIED ME THESE ABODES OF WOE
THEN THUS TO ME THAT I AM ANGER'D THINK
NO GROUND OF TERROR IN THIS TRIAL I
SHALL VANQUISH USE WHAT ARTS THEY MAY WITHIN
FOR HINDRANCE
THIS THEIR INSOLENCE NOT NEW
EREWHILE AT GATE LESS SECRET THEY DISPLAY'D
WHICH STILL IS WITHOUT BOLT UPON ITS ARCH
THOU SAW'ST THE DEADLY SCROLL AND EVEN NOW
ON THIS SIDE OF ITS ENTRANCE DOWN THE STEEP
PASSING THE CIRCLES UNESCORTED COMES
ONE WHOSE STRONG MIGHT CAN OPEN US THIS LAND
CANTO IX
THE HUE WHICH COWARD DREAD ON MY PALE CHEEKS
IMPRINTED WHEN I SAW MY GUIDE TURN BACK
CHAS'D THAT FROM HIS WHICH NEWLY THEY HAD WORN
AND INWARDLY RESTRAIN'D IT
HE AS ONE
WHO LISTENS STOOD ATTENTIVE FOR HIS EYE
NOT FAR COULD LEAD HIM THROUGH THE SABLE AIR
AND THE THICK GATH'RING CLOUD
IT YET BEHOOVES
WE WIN THIS FIGHT THUS HE BEGAN IF NOT
SUCH AID TO US IS OFFER'D OH HOW LONG
ME SEEMS IT ERE THE PROMIS'D HELP ARRIVE
I NOTED HOW THE SEQUEL OF HIS WORDS
CLOK'D THEIR BEGINNING FOR THE LAST HE SPAKE
AGREED NOT WITH THE FIRST
BUT NOT THE LESS
MY FEAR WAS AT HIS SAYING SITH I DREW
TO IMPORT WORSE PERCHANCE THAN THAT HE HELD
HIS MUTILATED SPEECH
DOTH EVER ANY
INTO THIS RUEFUL CONCAVE'S EXTREME DEPTH
DESCEND OUT OF THE FIRST DEGREE WHOSE PAIN
IS DEPRIVATION MERELY OF SWEET HOPE
THUS I INQUIRING
RARELY HE REPLIED
IT CHANCES THAT AMONG US ANY MAKES
THIS JOURNEY WHICH I WEND
EREWHILE 'TIS TRUE
ONCE CAME I HERE BENEATH CONJUR'D BY FELL
ERICTHO SORCERESS WHO COMPELL'D THE SHADES
BACK TO THEIR BODIES
NO LONG SPACE MY FLESH
WAS NAKED OF ME WHEN WITHIN THESE WALLS
SHE MADE ME ENTER TO DRAW FORTH A SPIRIT
FROM OUT OF JUDAS' CIRCLE
LOWEST PLACE
IS THAT OF ALL OBSCUREST AND REMOV'D
FARTHEST FROM HEAV'N'S ALL CIRCLING ORB
THE ROAD
FULL WELL I KNOW THOU THEREFORE REST SECURE
THAT LAKE THE NOISOME STENCH EXHALING ROUND
THE CITY' OF GRIEF ENCOMPASSES WHICH NOW
WE MAY NOT ENTER WITHOUT RAGE YET MORE
HE ADDED BUT I HOLD IT NOT IN MIND
FOR THAT MINE EYE TOWARD THE LOFTY TOWER
HAD DRAWN ME WHOLLY TO ITS BURNING TOP
WHERE IN AN INSTANT I BEHELD UPRISEN
AT ONCE THREE HELLISH FURIES STAIN'D WITH BLOOD
IN LIMB AND MOTION FEMININE THEY SEEM'D
AROUND THEM GREENEST HYDRAS TWISTING ROLL'D
THEIR VOLUMES ADDERS AND CERASTES CREPT
INSTEAD OF HAIR AND THEIR FIERCE TEMPLES BOUND
HE KNOWING WELL THE MISERABLE HAGS
WHO TEND THE QUEEN OF ENDLESS WOE THUS SPAKE
MARK THOU EACH DIRE ERINNYS
TO THE LEFT
THIS IS MEGAERA ON THE RIGHT HAND SHE
WHO WAILS ALECTO AND TISIPHONE
I' TH' MIDST THIS SAID IN SILENCE HE REMAIN'D
THEIR BREAST THEY EACH ONE CLAWING TORE THEMSELVES
SMOTE WITH THEIR PALMS AND SUCH SHRILL CLAMOUR RAIS'D
THAT TO THE BARD I CLUNG SUSPICION BOUND
HASTEN MEDUSA SO TO ADAMANT
HIM SHALL WE CHANGE ALL LOOKING DOWN EXCLAIM'D
E'EN WHEN BY THESEUS' MIGHT ASSAIL'D WE TOOK
NO ILL REVENGE TURN THYSELF ROUND AND KEEP
THY COUNT'NANCE HID FOR IF THE GORGON DIRE

UPWARDS WOULD BE FOR EVER LOST THIS SAID
HIMSELF MY GENTLE MASTER TURN'D ME ROUND
NOR TRUSTED HE MY HANDS BUT WITH HIS OWN
HE ALSO HID ME
YE OF INTELLECT
SOUND AND ENTIRE MARK WELL THE LORE CONCEAL'D
UNDER CLOSE TEXTURE OF THE MYSTIC STRAIN
AND NOW THERE CAME O'ER THE PERTURBED WAVES
LOUD CRASHING TERRIBLE A SOUND THAT MADE
EITHER SHORE TREMBLE AS IF OF A WIND
IMPETUOUS FROM CONFLICTING VAPOURS SPRUNG
THAT 'GAINST SOME FOREST DRIVING ALL ITS MIGHT
PLUCKS OFF THE BRANCHES BEATS THEM DOWN AND HURLS
AFAR THEN ONWARD PASSING PROUDLY SWEEPS
ITS WHIRLWIND RAGE WHILE BEASTS AND SHEPHERDS FLY
MINE EYES HE LOOS'D AND SPAKE AND NOW DIRECT
THY VISUAL NERVE ALONG THAT ANCIENT FOAM
THERE THICKEST WHERE THE SMOKE ASCENDS AS FROGS
BEFORE THEIR FOE THE SERPENT THROUGH THE WAVE
PLY SWIFTLY ALL TILL AT THE GROUND EACH ONE
LIES ON A HEAP MORE THAN A THOUSAND SPIRITS
DESTROY'D SO SAW I FLEEING BEFORE ONE
WHO PASS'D WITH UNWET FEET THE STYGIAN SOUND
HE FROM HIS FACE REMOVING THE GROSS AIR
OFT HIS LEFT HAND FORTH STRETCH'D AND SEEM'D ALONE
BY THAT ANNOYANCE WEARIED
I PERCEIV'D
THAT HE WAS SENT FROM HEAV'N AND TO MY GUIDE
TURN'D ME WHO SIGNAL MADE THAT I SHOULD STAND
QUIET AND BEND TO HIM
AH ME HOW FULL
OF NOBLE ANGER SEEM'D HE TO THE GATE
HE CAME AND WITH HIS WAND TOUCH'D IT WHEREAT
OPEN WITHOUT IMPEDIMENT IT FLEW
OUTCASTS OF HEAV'N O ABJECT RACE AND SCORN'D
BEGAN HE ON THE HORRID GRUNSEL STANDING
WHENCE DOTH THIS WILD EXCESS OF INSOLENCE
LODGE IN YOU WHEREFORE KICK YOU 'GAINST THAT WILL
NE'ER FRUSTRATE OF ITS END AND WHICH SO OFT
HATH LAID ON YOU ENFORCEMENT OF YOUR PANGS
WHAT PROFITS AT THE FAYS TO BUT THE HORN
YOUR CERBERUS IF YE REMEMBER HENCE
BEARS STILL PEEL'D OF THEIR HAIR HIS THROAT AND MAW
THIS SAID HE TURN'D BACK O'ER THE FILTHY WAY
AND SYLLABLE TO US SPAKE NONE BUT WORE
THE SEMBLANCE OF A MAN BY OTHER CARE
BESET AND KEENLY PRESS'D THAN THOUGHT OF HIM
WHO IN HIS PRESENCE STANDS
THEN WE OUR STEPS
TOWARD THAT TERRITORY MOV'D SECURE
AFTER THE HALLOW'D WORDS
WE UNOPPOS'D
THERE ENTER'D AND MY MIND EAGER TO LEARN
WHAT STATE A FORTRESS LIKE TO THAT MIGHT HOLD
I SOON AS ENTER'D THROW MINE EYE AROUND
AND SEE ON EVERY PART WIDE STRETCHING SPACE
REPLETE WITH BITTER PAIN AND TORMENT ILL
AS WHERE RHONE STAGNATES ON THE PLAINS OF ARLES
OR AS AT POLA NEAR QUARNARO'S GULF
THAT CLOSES ITALY AND LAVES HER BOUNDS
THE PLACE IS ALL THICK SPREAD WITH SEPULCHRES
SO WAS IT HERE SAVE WHAT IN HORROR HERE
EXCELL'D FOR 'MIDST THE GRAVES WERE SCATTERED FLAMES
WHEREWITH INTENSELY ALL THROUGHOUT THEY BURN'D
THAT IRON FOR NO CRAFT THERE HOTTER NEEDS
THEIR LIDS ALL HUNG SUSPENDED AND BENEATH
FROM THEM FORTH ISSU'D LAMENTABLE MOANS
SUCH AS THE SAD AND TORTUR'D WELL MIGHT RAISE
I THUS MASTER SAY WHO ARE THESE INTERR'D
WITHIN THESE VAULTS OF WHOM DISTINCT WE HEAR
THE DOLOROUS SIGHS HE ANSWER THUS RETURN'D

WITH LIKE IS BURIED AND THE MONUMENTS
ARE DIFFERENT IN DEGREES OF HEAT THIS SAID
HE TO THE RIGHT HAND TURNING ON WE PASS'D
BETWIXT THE AFFLICTED AND THE RAMPARTS HIGH
CANTO X
NOW BY A SECRET PATHWAY WE PROCEED
BETWEEN THE WALLS THAT HEM THE REGION ROUND
AND THE TORMENTED SOULS MY MASTER FIRST
I CLOSE BEHIND HIS STEPS
VIRTUE SUPREME
I THUS BEGAN WHO THROUGH THESE AMPLE ORBS
IN CIRCUIT LEAD'ST ME EVEN AS THOU WILL'ST
SPEAK THOU AND SATISFY MY WISH
MAY THOSE
WHO LIE WITHIN THESE SEPULCHRES BE SEEN
ALREADY ALL THE LIDS ARE RAIS'D AND NONE
O'ER THEM KEEPS WATCH HE THUS IN ANSWER SPAKE
THEY SHALL BE CLOSED ALL WHAT TIME THEY HERE
FROM JOSAPHAT RETURN'D SHALL COME AND BRING
THEIR BODIES WHICH ABOVE THEY NOW HAVE LEFT
THE CEMETERY ON THIS PART OBTAIN
WITH EPICURUS ALL HIS FOLLOWERS
WHO WITH THE BODY MAKE THE SPIRIT DIE
HERE THEREFORE SATISFACTION SHALL BE SOON
BOTH TO THE QUESTION ASK'D AND TO THE WISH
WHICH THOU CONCEAL'ST IN SILENCE I REPLIED
I KEEP NOT GUIDE BELOV'D FROM THEE MY HEART
SECRETED BUT TO SHUN VAIN LENGTH OF WORDS
A LESSON EREWHILE TAUGHT ME BY THYSELF
O TUSCAN THOU WHO THROUGH THE CITY OF FIRE
ALIVE ART PASSING SO DISCREET OF SPEECH
HERE PLEASE THEE STAY AWHILE
THY UTTERANCE
DECLARES THE PLACE OF THY NATIVITY
TO BE THAT NOBLE LAND WITH WHICH PERCHANCE
I TOO SEVERELY DEALT SUDDEN THAT SOUND
FORTH ISSU'D FROM A VAULT WHEREAT IN FEAR
I SOMEWHAT CLOSER TO MY LEADER'S SIDE
APPROACHING HE THUS SPAKE WHAT DOST THOU TURN
LO FARINATA THERE WHO HATH HIMSELF
UPLIFTED FROM HIS GIRDLE UPWARDS ALL
EXPOS'D BEHOLD HIM ON HIS FACE WAS MINE
ALREADY FIX'D HIS BREAST AND FOREHEAD THERE
ERECTING SEEM'D AS IN HIGH SCORN HE HELD
E'EN HELL
BETWEEN THE SEPULCHRES TO HIM
MY GUIDE THRUST ME WITH FEARLESS HANDS AND PROMPT
THIS WARNING ADDED SEE THY WORDS BE CLEAR
HE SOON AS THERE I STOOD AT THE TOMB'S FOOT
EY'D ME A SPACE THEN IN DISDAINFUL MOOD
ADDRESS'D ME SAY WHAT ANCESTORS WERE THINE
I WILLING TO OBEY HIM STRAIGHT REVEAL'D
THE WHOLE NOR KEPT BACK AUGHT WHENCE HE HIS BROW
SOMEWHAT UPLIFTING CRIED FIERCELY WERE THEY
ADVERSE TO ME MY PARTY AND THE BLOOD
FROM WHENCE I SPRANG TWICE THEREFORE I ABROAD
SCATTER'D THEM THOUGH DRIV'N OUT YET THEY EACH TIME
FROM ALL PARTS ANSWER'D I RETURN'D AN ART
WHICH YOURS HAVE SHOWN THEY ARE NOT SKILL'D TO LEARN
THEN PEERING FORTH FROM THE UNCLOSED JAW
ROSE FROM HIS SIDE A SHADE HIGH AS THE CHIN
LEANING METHOUGHT UPON ITS KNEES UPRAIS'D
IT LOOK'D AROUND AS EAGER TO EXPLORE
IF THERE WERE OTHER WITH ME BUT PERCEIVING
THAT FOND IMAGINATION QUENCH'D WITH TEARS
THUS SPAKE IF THOU THROUGH THIS BLIND PRISON GO'ST
LED BY THY LOFTY GENIUS AND PROFOUND
WHERE IS MY SON AND WHEREFORE NOT WITH THEE
I STRAIGHT REPLIED NOT OF MYSELF I COME
BY HIM WHO THERE EXPECTS ME THROUGH THIS CLIME
CONDUCTED WHOM PERCHANCE GUIDO THY SON
HAD IN CONTEMPT ALREADY HAD HIS WORDS
AND MODE OF PUNISHMENT READ ME HIS NAME
WHENCE I SO FULLY ANSWER'D
HE AT ONCE
EXCLAIM'D UP STARTING HOW SAID'ST THOU HE HAD
NO LONGER LIVES HE STRIKES NOT ON HIS EYE
THE BLESSED DAYLIGHT THEN OF SOME DELAY
I MADE ERE MY REPLY AWARE DOWN FELL
SUPINE NOT AFTER FORTH APPEAR'D HE MORE
MEANWHILE THE OTHER GREAT OF SOUL NEAR WHOM
I YET WAS STATION'D CHANG'D NOT COUNT'NANCE STERN
NOR MOV'D THE NECK NOR BENT HIS RIBBED SIDE
AND IF CONTINUING THE FIRST DISCOURSE
THEY IN THIS ART HE CRIED SMALL SKILL HAVE SHOWN
THAT DOTH TORMENT ME MORE E'EN THAN THIS BED
BUT NOT YET FIFTY TIMES SHALL BE RELUM'D
HER ASPECT WHO REIGNS HERE QUEEN OF THIS REALM
ERE THOU SHALT KNOW THE FULL WEIGHT OF THAT ART
SO TO THE PLEASANT WORLD MAYST THOU RETURN
AS THOU SHALT TELL ME WHY IN ALL THEIR LAWS
AGAINST MY KIN THIS PEOPLE IS SO FELL
THE SLAUGHTER AND GREAT HAVOC I REPLIED
THAT COLOUR'D ARBIA'S FLOOD WITH CRIMSON STAIN
TO THESE IMPUTE THAT IN OUR HALLOW'D DOME
SUCH ORISONS ASCEND SIGHING HE SHOOK
THE HEAD THEN THUS RESUM'D IN THAT AFFRAY
I STOOD NOT SINGLY NOR WITHOUT JUST CAUSE
ASSUREDLY SHOULD WITH THE REST HAVE STIRR'D
BUT SINGLY THERE I STOOD WHEN BY CONSENT
OF ALL FLORENCE HAD TO THE GROUND BEEN RAZ'D
THE ONE WHO OPENLY FORBAD THE DEED
SO MAY THY LINEAGE FIND AT LAST REPOSE
I THUS ADJUR'D HIM AS THOU SOLVE THIS KNOT
WHICH NOW INVOLVES MY MIND
IF RIGHT I HEAR
YE SEEM TO VIEW BEFOREHAND THAT WHICH TIME
LEADS WITH HIM OF THE PRESENT UNINFORM'D
WE VIEW AS ONE WHO HATH AN EVIL SIGHT
HE ANSWER'D PLAINLY OBJECTS FAR REMOTE
SO MUCH OF HIS LARGE SPENDOUR YET IMPARTS
THE' ALMIGHTY RULER BUT WHEN THEY APPROACH
OR ACTUALLY EXIST OUR INTELLECT
THEN WHOLLY FAILS NOR OF YOUR HUMAN STATE
EXCEPT WHAT OTHERS BRING US KNOW WE AUGHT
HENCE THEREFORE MAYST THOU UNDERSTAND THAT ALL
OUR KNOWLEDGE IN THAT INSTANT SHALL EXPIRE
WHEN ON FUTURITY THE PORTALS CLOSE
THEN CONSCIOUS OF MY FAULT AND BY REMORSE
SMITTEN I ADDED THUS NOW SHALT THOU SAY
TO HIM THERE FALLEN THAT HIS OFFSPRING STILL
IS TO THE LIVING JOIN'D AND BID HIM KNOW
THAT IF FROM ANSWER SILENT I ABSTAIN'D
'TWAS THAT MY THOUGHT WAS OCCUPIED INTENT
UPON THAT ERROR WHICH THY HELP HATH SOLV'D
BUT NOW MY MASTER SUMMONING ME BACK
I HEARD AND WITH MORE EAGER HASTE BESOUGHT
THE SPIRIT TO INFORM ME WHO WITH HIM
PARTOOK HIS LOT
HE ANSWER THUS RETURN'D
MORE THAN A THOUSAND WITH ME HERE ARE LAID
WITHIN IS FREDERICK SECOND OF THAT NAME
AND THE LORD CARDINAL AND OF THE REST
I SPEAK NOT HE THIS SAID FROM SIGHT WITHDREW
BUT I MY STEPS TOWARDS THE ANCIENT BARD
REVERTING RUMINATED ON THE WORDS
BETOKENING ME SUCH ILL
ONWARD HE MOV'D
AND THUS IN GOING QUESTION'D WHENCE THE' AMAZE
THAT HOLDS THY SENSES WRAPT I SATISFIED
THE' INQUIRY AND THE SAGE ENJOIN'D ME STRAIGHT
LET THY SAFE MEMORY STORE WHAT THOU HAST HEARD
TO THEE IMPORTING HARM AND NOTE THOU THIS
WITH HIS RAIS'D FINGER BIDDING ME TAKE HEED
WHEN THOU SHALT STAND BEFORE HER GRACIOUS BEAM
WHOSE BRIGHT EYE ALL SURVEYS SHE OF THY LIFE
THE FUTURE TENOUR WILL TO THEE UNFOLD
FORTHWITH HE TO THE LEFT HAND TURN'D HIS FEET
WE LEFT THE WALL AND TOW'RDS THE MIDDLE SPACE
WENT BY A PATH THAT TO A VALLEY STRIKES
WHICH E'EN THUS HIGH EXHAL'D ITS NOISOME STEAM
CANTO XI
UPON THE UTMOST VERGE OF A HIGH BANK
BY CRAGGY ROCKS ENVIRON'D ROUND WE CAME
WHERE WOES BENEATH MORE CRUEL YET WERE STOW'D
AND HERE TO SHUN THE HORRIBLE EXCESS
OF FETID EXHALATION UPWARD CAST
FROM THE PROFOUND ABYSS BEHIND THE LID
OF A GREAT MONUMENT WE STOOD RETIR'D
WHEREON THIS SCROLL I MARK'D I HAVE IN CHARGE
POPE ANASTASIUS WHOM PHOTINUS DREW
FROM THE RIGHT PATH ERE OUR DESCENT BEHOOVES
WE MAKE DELAY THAT SOMEWHAT FIRST THE SENSE
TO THE DIRE BREATH ACCUSTOM'D AFTERWARD
REGARD IT NOT MY MASTER THUS TO WHOM
ANSWERING I SPAKE SOME COMPENSATION FIND
THAT THE TIME PAST NOT WHOLLY LOST HE THEN
LO HOW MY THOUGHTS E'EN TO THY WISHES TEND
MY SON WITHIN THESE ROCKS HE THUS BEGAN
ARE THREE CLOSE CIRCLES IN GRADATION PLAC'D
AS THESE WHICH NOW THOU LEAV'ST
EACH ONE IS FULL
OF SPIRITS ACCURS'D BUT THAT THE SIGHT ALONE
HEREAFTER MAY SUFFICE THEE LISTEN HOW
AND FOR WHAT CAUSE IN DURANCE THEY ABIDE
OF ALL MALICIOUS ACT ABHORR'D IN HEAVEN
THE END IS INJURY AND ALL SUCH END
EITHER BY FORCE OR FRAUD WORKS OTHER'S WOE
BUT FRAUD BECAUSE OF MAN PECULIAR EVIL
TO GOD IS MORE DISPLEASING AND BENEATH
THE FRAUDULENT ARE THEREFORE DOOM'D TO' ENDURE
SEVERER PANG
THE VIOLENT OCCUPY
ALL THE FIRST CIRCLE AND BECAUSE TO FORCE
THREE PERSONS ARE OBNOXIOUS IN THREE ROUNDS
HACH WITHIN OTHER SEP'RATE IS IT FRAM'D
TO GOD HIS NEIGHBOUR AND HIMSELF BY MAN
FORCE MAY BE OFFER'D TO HIMSELF I SAY
AND HIS POSSESSIONS AS THOU SOON SHALT HEAR
AT FULL
DEATH VIOLENT DEATH AND PAINFUL WOUNDS
UPON HIS NEIGHBOUR HE INFLICTS AND WASTES
BY DEVASTATION PILLAGE AND THE FLAMES
HIS SUBSTANCE
SLAYERS AND EACH ONE THAT SMITES
IN MALICE PLUND'RERS AND ALL ROBBERS HENCE
THE TORMENT UNDERGO OF THE FIRST ROUND
IN DIFFERENT HERDS
MAN CAN DO VIOLENCE
TO HIMSELF AND HIS OWN BLESSINGS AND FOR THIS
HE IN THE SECOND ROUND MUST AYE DEPLORE
WITH UNAVAILING PENITENCE HIS CRIME
WHOE'ER DEPRIVES HIMSELF OF LIFE AND LIGHT
IN RECKLESS LAVISHMENT HIS TALENT WASTES
AND SORROWS THERE WHERE HE SHOULD DWELL IN JOY
TO GOD MAY FORCE BE OFFER'D IN THE HEART
DENYING AND BLASPHEMING HIS HIGH POWER
AND NATURE WITH HER KINDLY LAW CONTEMNING
AND THENCE THE INMOST ROUND MARKS WITH ITS SEAL
SODOM AND CAHORS AND ALL SUCH AS SPEAK
CONTEMPTUOUSLY' OF THE GODHEAD IN THEIR HEARTS
FRAUD THAT IN EVERY CONSCIENCE LEAVES A STING
MAY BE BY MAN EMPLOY'D ON ONE WHOSE TRUST
HE WINS OR ON ANOTHER WHO WITHHOLDS
STRICT CONFIDENCE
SEEMS AS THE LATTER WAY
BROKE BUT THE BOND OF LOVE WHICH NATURE MAKES
WHENCE IN THE SECOND CIRCLE HAVE THEIR NEST
DISSIMULATION WITCHCRAFT FLATTERIES
THEFT FALSEHOOD SIMONY ALL WHO SEDUCE
TO LUST OR SET THEIR HONESTY AT PAWN
WITH SUCH VILE SCUM AS THESE
THE OTHER WAY
FORGETS BOTH NATURE'S GENERAL LOVE AND THAT
WHICH THERETO ADDED AFTERWARDS GIVES BIRTH
TO SPECIAL FAITH
WHENCE IN THE LESSER CIRCLE
POINT OF THE UNIVERSE DREAD SEAT OF DIS
THE TRAITOR IS ETERNALLY CONSUM'D
I THUS INSTRUCTOR CLEARLY THY DISCOURSE
PROCEEDS DISTINGUISHING THE HIDEOUS CHASM
AND ITS INHABITANTS WITH SKILL EXACT
BUT TELL ME THIS THEY OF THE DULL FAT POOL
WHOM THE RAIN BEATS OR WHOM THE TEMPEST DRIVES
OR WHO WITH TONGUES SO FIERCE CONFLICTING MEET
WHEREFORE WITHIN THE CITY FIRE ILLUM'D
ARE NOT THESE PUNISH'D IF GOD'S WRATH BE ON THEM
AND IF IT BE NOT WHEREFORE IN SUCH GUISE
ARE THEY CONDEMNED HE ANSWER THUS RETURN'D
WHEREFORE IN DOTAGE WANDERS THUS THY MIND
NOT SO ACCUSTOM'D OR WHAT OTHER THOUGHTS
POSSESS IT DWELL NOT IN THY MEMORY
THE WORDS WHEREIN THY ETHIC PAGE DESCRIBES
THREE DISPOSITIONS ADVERSE TO HEAV'N'S WILL
INCONT'NENCE MALICE AND MAD BRUTISHNESS
AND HOW INCONTINENCE THE LEAST OFFENDS
GOD AND LEAST GUILT INCURS IF WELL THOU NOTE
THIS JUDGMENT AND REMEMBER WHO THEY ARE
WITHOUT THESE WALLS TO VAIN REPENTANCE DOOM'D
THOU SHALT DISCERN WHY THEY APART ARE PLAC'D
FROM THESE FELL SPIRITS AND LESS WREAKFUL POURS
JUSTICE DIVINE ON THEM ITS VENGEANCE DOWN
O SUN WHO HEALEST ALL IMPERFECT SIGHT
THOU SO CONTENT'ST ME WHEN THOU SOLV'ST MY DOUBT
THAT IGNORANCE NOT LESS THAN KNOWLEDGE CHARMS
YET SOMEWHAT TURN THEE BACK I IN THESE WORDS
CONTINU'D WHERE THOU SAIDST THAT USURY
OFFENDS CELESTIAL GOODNESS AND THIS KNOT
PERPLEX'D UNRAVEL HE THUS MADE REPLY
PHILOSOPHY TO AN ATTENTIVE EAR
CLEARLY POINTS OUT NOT IN ONE PART ALONE
HOW IMITATIVE NATURE TAKES HER COURSE
FROM THE CELESTIAL MIND AND FROM ITS ART
AND WHERE HER LAWS THE STAGYRITE UNFOLDS
NOT MANY LEAVES SCANN'D O'ER OBSERVING WELL
THOU SHALT DISCOVER THAT YOUR ART ON HER
OBSEQUIOUS FOLLOWS AS THE LEARNER TREADS
IN HIS INSTRUCTOR'S STEP SO THAT YOUR ART
DESERVES THE NAME OF SECOND IN DESCENT
FROM GOD
THESE TWO IF THOU RECALL TO MIND
CREATION'S HOLY BOOK FROM THE BEGINNING
WERE THE RIGHT SOURCE OF LIFE AND EXCELLENCE
TO HUMAN KIND
BUT IN ANOTHER PATH
THE USURER WALKS AND NATURE IN HERSELF
AND IN HER FOLLOWER THUS HE SETS AT NOUGHT
PLACING ELSEWHERE HIS HOPE
BUT FOLLOW NOW
MY STEPS ON FORWARD JOURNEY BENT FOR NOW
THE PISCES PLAY WITH UNDULATING GLANCE
ALONG THE' HORIZON AND THE WAIN LIES ALL
O'ER THE NORTH WEST AND ONWARD THERE A SPACE
IS OUR STEEP PASSAGE DOWN THE ROCKY HEIGHT
CANTO XII
THE PLACE WHERE TO DESCEND THE PRECIPICE
WE CAME WAS ROUGH AS ALP AND ON ITS VERGE
SUCH OBJECT LAY AS EVERY EYE WOULD SHUN
AS IS THAT RUIN WHICH ADICE'S STREAM
ON THIS SIDE TRENTO STRUCK SHOULD'RING THE WAVE
OR LOOS'D BY EARTHQUAKE OR FOR LACK OF PROP
FOR FROM THE MOUNTAIN'S SUMMIT WHENCE IT MOV'D
TO THE LOW LEVEL SO THE HEADLONG ROCK
IS SHIVER'D THAT SOME PASSAGE IT MIGHT GIVE
TO HIM WHO FROM ABOVE WOULD PASS E'EN SUCH
INTO THE CHASM WAS THAT DESCENT AND THERE
AT POINT OF THE DISPARTED RIDGE LAY STRETCH'D
THE INFAMY OF CRETE DETESTED BROOD
OF THE FEIGN'D HEIFER AND AT SIGHT OF US
IT GNAW'D ITSELF AS ONE WITH RAGE DISTRACT
TO HIM MY GUIDE EXCLAIM'D PERCHANCE THOU DEEM'ST
THE KING OF ATHENS HERE WHO IN THE WORLD
ABOVE THY DEATH CONTRIV'D
MONSTER AVAUNT
HE COMES NOT TUTOR'D BY THY SISTER'S ART
BUT TO BEHOLD YOUR TORMENTS IS HE COME
LIKE TO A BULL THAT WITH IMPETUOUS SPRING
DARTS AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE FATAL BLOW
HATH STRUCK HIM BUT UNABLE TO PROCEED
PLUNGES ON EITHER SIDE SO SAW I PLUNGE
THE MINOTAUR WHEREAT THE SAGE EXCLAIM'D
RUN TO THE PASSAGE WHILE HE STORMS 'T IS WELL
THAT THOU DESCEND THUS DOWN OUR ROAD WE TOOK
THROUGH THOSE DILAPIDATED CRAGS THAT OFT
MOV'D UNDERNEATH MY FEET TO WEIGHT LIKE THEIRS
UNUS'D
I POND'RING WENT AND THUS HE SPAKE
PERHAPS THY THOUGHTS ARE OF THIS RUIN'D STEEP
GUARDED BY THE BRUTE VIOLENCE WHICH I
HAVE VANQUISH'D NOW
KNOW THEN THAT WHEN I ERST
HITHER DESCENDED TO THE NETHER HELL
THIS ROCK WAS NOT YET FALLEN
BUT PAST DOUBT
IF WELL I MARK NOT LONG ERE HE ARRIVED
WHO CARRIED OFF FROM DIS THE MIGHTY SPOIL
OF THE HIGHEST CIRCLE THEN THROUGH ALL ITS BOUNDS
SUCH TREMBLING SEIZ'D THE DEEP CONCAVE AND FOUL
I THOUGHT THE UNIVERSE WAS THRILL'D WITH LOVE
WHEREBY THERE ARE WHO DEEM THE WORLD HATH OFT
BEEN INTO CHAOS TURN'D AND IN THAT POINT
HERE AND ELSEWHERE THAT OLD ROCK TOPPLED DOWN
BUT FIX THINE EYES BENEATH THE RIVER OF BLOOD
APPROACHES IN THE WHICH ALL THOSE ARE STEEP'D
WHO HAVE BY VIOLENCE INJUR'D O BLIND LUST
O FOOLISH WRATH WHO SO DOST GOAD US ON
IN THE BRIEF LIFE AND IN THE ETERNAL THEN
THUS MISERABLY O'ERWHELM US
I BEHELD
AN AMPLE FOSS THAT IN A BOW WAS BENT
AS CIRCLING ALL THE PLAIN FOR SO MY GUIDE
HAD TOLD
BETWEEN IT AND THE RAMPART'S BASE
ON TRAIL RAN CENTAURS WITH KEEN ARROWS ARM'D
AS TO THE CHASE THEY ON THE EARTH WERE WONT
AT SEEING US DESCEND THEY EACH ONE STOOD
AND ISSUING FROM THE TROOP THREE SPED WITH BOWS
AND MISSILE WEAPONS CHOSEN FIRST OF WHOM
ONE CRIED FROM FAR SAY TO WHAT PAIN YE COME
CONDEMN'D WHO DOWN THIS STEEP HAVE JOURNIED SPEAK
FROM WHENCE YE STAND OR ELSE THE BOW I DRAW
TO WHOM MY GUIDE OUR ANSWER SHALL BE MADE
TO CHIRON THERE WHEN NEARER HIM WE COME
ILL WAS THY MIND THUS EVER QUICK AND RASH
THEN ME HE TOUCH'D AND SPAKE NESSUS IS THIS
WHO FOR THE FAIR DEIANIRA DIED
AND WROUGHT HIMSELF REVENGE FOR HIS OWN FATE
HE IN THE MIDST THAT ON HIS BREAST LOOKS DOWN
IS THE GREAT CHIRON WHO ACHILLES NURS'D
THAT OTHER PHOLUS PRONE TO WRATH AROUND
THE FOSS THESE GO BY THOUSANDS AIMING SHAFTS
AT WHATSOEVER SPIRIT DARES EMERGE
FROM OUT THE BLOOD MORE THAN HIS GUILT ALLOWS
WE TO THOSE BEASTS THAT RAPID STRODE ALONG
DREW NEAR WHEN CHIRON TOOK AN ARROW FORTH
AND WITH THE NOTCH PUSH'D BACK HIS SHAGGY BEARD
TO THE CHEEK BONE THEN HIS GREAT MOUTH TO VIEW
EXPOSING TO HIS FELLOWS THUS EXCLAIM'D
ARE YE AWARE THAT HE WHO COMES BEHIND
MOVES WHAT HE TOUCHES THE FEET OF THE DEAD
ARE NOT SO WONT MY TRUSTY GUIDE WHO NOW
STOOD NEAR HIS BREAST WHERE THE TWO NATURES JOIN
THUS MADE REPLY HE IS INDEED ALIVE
AND SOLITARY SO MUST NEEDS BY ME
BE SHOWN THE GLOOMY VALE THERETO INDUC'D
BY STRICT NECESSITY NOT BY DELIGHT
SHE LEFT HER JOYFUL HARPINGS IN THE SKY
WHO THIS NEW OFFICE TO MY CARE CONSIGN'D
HE IS NO ROBBER NO DARK SPIRIT I
BUT BY THAT VIRTUE WHICH EMPOWERS MY STEP
TO TREAT SO WILD A PATH GRANT US I PRAY
ONE OF THY BAND WHOM WE MAY TRUST SECURE
WHO TO THE FORD MAY LEAD US AND CONVEY
ACROSS HIM MOUNTED ON HIS BACK FOR HE
IS NOT A SPIRIT THAT MAY WALK THE AIR
THEN ON HIS RIGHT BREAST TURNING CHIRON THUS
TO NESSUS SPAKE RETURN AND BE THEIR GUIDE
AND IF YE CHANCE TO CROSS ANOTHER TROOP
COMMAND THEM KEEP ALOOF ONWARD WE MOV'D
THE FAITHFUL ESCORT BY OUR SIDE ALONG
THE BORDER OF THE CRIMSON SEETHING FLOOD
WHENCE FROM THOSE STEEP'D WITHIN LOUD SHRIEKS AROSE
SOME THERE I MARK'D AS HIGH AS TO THEIR BROW
IMMERS'D OF WHOM THE MIGHTY CENTAUR THUS
THESE ARE THE SOULS OF TYRANTS WHO WERE GIVEN
TO BLOOD AND RAPINE
HERE THEY WAIL ALOUD
THEIR MERCILESS WRONGS
HERE ALEXANDER DWELLS
AND DIONYSIUS FELL WHO MANY A YEAR
OF WOE WROUGHT FOR FAIR SICILY
THAT BROW
WHEREON THE HAIR SO JETTY CLUST'RING HANGS
IS AZZOLINO THAT WITH FLAXEN LOCKS
OBIZZO' OF ESTE IN THE WORLD DESTROY'D
BY HIS FOUL STEP SON TO THE BARD REVER'D
I TURNED ME ROUND AND THUS HE SPAKE LET HIM
BE TO THEE NOW FIRST LEADER ME BUT NEXT
TO HIM IN RANK THEN FARTHER ON A SPACE
THE CENTAUR PAUS'D NEAR SOME WHO AT THE THROAT
WERE EXTANT FROM THE WAVE AND SHOWING US
A SPIRIT BY ITSELF APART RETIR'D
EXCLAIM'D HE IN GOD'S BOSOM SMOTE THE HEART
WHICH YET IS HONOUR'D ON THE BANK OF THAMES
A RACE I NEXT ESPIED WHO HELD THE HEAD
AND EVEN ALL THE BUST ABOVE THE STREAM
'MIDST THESE I MANY A FACE REMEMBER'D WELL
THUS SHALLOW MORE AND MORE THE BLOOD BECAME
SO THAT AT LAST IT BUT IMBRU'D THE FEET
AND THERE OUR PASSAGE LAY ATHWART THE FOSS
AS EVER ON THIS SIDE THE BOILING WAVE
THOU SEEST DIMINISHING THE CENTAUR SAID
SO ON THE OTHER BE THOU WELL ASSUR'D
IT LOWER STILL AND LOWER SINKS ITS BED
TILL IN THAT PART IT REUNITING JOIN
WHERE 'T IS THE LOT OF TYRANNY TO MOURN
THERE HEAV'N'S STERN JUSTICE LAYS CHASTISING HAND
ON ATTILA WHO WAS THE SCOURGE OF EARTH
ON SEXTUS AND ON PYRRHUS AND EXTRACTS
TEARS EVER BY THE SEETHING FLOOD UNLOCK'D
FROM THE RINIERI OF CORNETO THIS
PAZZO THE OTHER NAM'D WHO FILL'D THE WAYS
WITH VIOLENCE AND WAR THIS SAID HE TURN'D
AND QUITTING US ALONE REPASS'D THE FORD
CANTO XIII
ERE NESSUS YET HAD REACH'D THE OTHER BANK
WE ENTER'D ON A FOREST WHERE NO TRACK
OF STEPS HAD WORN A WAY
NOT VERDANT THERE
THE FOLIAGE BUT OF DUSKY HUE NOT LIGHT
THE BOUGHS AND TAPERING BUT WITH KNARES DEFORM'D
AND MATTED THICK FRUITS THERE WERE NONE BUT THORNS
INSTEAD WITH VENOM FILL'D
LESS SHARP THAN THESE
LESS INTRICATE THE BRAKES WHEREIN ABIDE
THOSE ANIMALS THAT HATE THE CULTUR'D FIELDS
BETWIXT CORNETO AND CECINA'S STREAM
HERE THE BRUTE HARPIES MAKE THEIR NEST THE SAME
WHO FROM THE STROPHADES THE TROJAN BAND
DROVE WITH DIRE BODING OF THEIR FUTURE WOE
BROAD ARE THEIR PENNONS OF THE HUMAN FORM
THEIR NECK AND COUNT'NANCE ARM'D WITH TALONS KEEN
THE FEET AND THE HUGE BELLY FLEDGE WITH WINGS
THESE SIT AND WAIL ON THE DREAR MYSTIC WOOD
THE KIND INSTRUCTOR IN THESE WORDS BEGAN
ERE FARTHER THOU PROCEED KNOW THOU ART NOW
I' TH' SECOND ROUND AND SHALT BE TILL THOU COME
UPON THE HORRID SAND LOOK THEREFORE WELL
AROUND THEE AND SUCH THINGS THOU SHALT BEHOLD
AS WOULD MY SPEECH DISCREDIT ON ALL SIDES
I HEARD SAD PLAININGS BREATHE AND NONE COULD SEE
FROM WHOM THEY MIGHT HAVE ISSU'D
IN AMAZE
FAST BOUND I STOOD
HE AS IT SEEM'D BELIEV'D
THAT I HAD THOUGHT SO MANY VOICES CAME
FROM SOME AMID THOSE THICKETS CLOSE CONCEAL'D
AND THUS HIS SPEECH RESUM'D IF THOU LOP OFF
A SINGLE TWIG FROM ONE OF THOSE ILL PLANTS
THE THOUGHT THOU HAST CONCEIV'D SHALL VANISH QUITE
THEREAT A LITTLE STRETCHING FORTH MY HAND
FROM A GREAT WILDING GATHER'D I A BRANCH
AND STRAIGHT THE TRUNK EXCLAIM'D WHY PLUCK'ST THOU ME
THEN AS THE DARK BLOOD TRICKLED DOWN ITS SIDE
THESE WORDS IT ADDED WHEREFORE TEAR'ST ME THUS
IS THERE NO TOUCH OF MERCY IN THY BREAST
MEN ONCE WERE WE THAT NOW ARE ROOTED HERE
THY HAND MIGHT WELL HAVE SPAR'D US HAD WE BEEN
THE SOULS OF SERPENTS AS A BRAND YET GREEN
THAT BURNING AT ONE END FROM THE' OTHER SENDS
A GROANING SOUND AND HISSES WITH THE WIND
THAT FORCES OUT ITS WAY SO BURST AT ONCE
FORTH FROM THE BROKEN SPLINTER WORDS AND BLOOD
I LETTING FALL THE BOUGH REMAIN'D AS ONE
ASSAIL'D BY TERROR AND THE SAGE REPLIED
IF HE O INJUR'D SPIRIT COULD HAVE BELIEV'D
WHAT HE HATH SEEN BUT IN MY VERSE DESCRIB'D
HE NEVER AGAINST THEE HAD STRETCH'D HIS HAND
BUT I BECAUSE THE THING SURPASS'D BELIEF
PROMPTED HIM TO THIS DEED WHICH EVEN NOW
MYSELF I RUE
BUT TELL ME WHO THOU WAST
THAT FOR THIS WRONG TO DO THEE SOME AMENDS
IN THE UPPER WORLD FOR THITHER TO RETURN
IS GRANTED HIM THY FAME HE MAY REVIVE
THAT PLEASANT WORD OF THINE THE TRUNK REPLIED
HATH SO INVEIGLED ME THAT I FROM SPEECH
CANNOT REFRAIN WHEREIN IF I INDULGE
A LITTLE LONGER IN THE SNARE DETAIN'D
COUNT IT NOT GRIEVOUS
I IT WAS WHO HELD
BOTH KEYS TO FREDERICK'S HEART AND TURN'D THE WARDS
OPENING AND SHUTTING WITH A SKILL SO SWEET
THAT BESIDES ME INTO HIS INMOST BREAST
SCARCE ANY OTHER COULD ADMITTANCE FIND
THE FAITH I BORE TO MY HIGH CHARGE WAS SUCH
IT COST ME THE LIFE BLOOD THAT WARM'D MY VEINS
THE HARLOT WHO NE'ER TURN'D HER GLOATING EYES
FROM CAESAR'S HOUSEHOLD COMMON VICE AND PEST
OF COURTS 'GAINST ME INFLAM'D THE MINDS OF ALL
AND TO AUGUSTUS THEY SO SPREAD THE FLAME
THAT MY GLAD HONOURS CHANG'D TO BITTER WOES
MY SOUL DISDAINFUL AND DISGUSTED SOUGHT
REFUGE IN DEATH FROM SCORN AND I BECAME
JUST AS I WAS UNJUST TOWARD MYSELF
BY THE NEW ROOTS WHICH FIX THIS STEM I SWEAR
THAT NEVER FAITH I BROKE TO MY LIEGE LORD
WHO MERITED SUCH HONOUR AND OF YOU
IF ANY TO THE WORLD INDEED RETURN
CLEAR HE FROM WRONG MY MEMORY THAT LIES
YET PROSTRATE UNDER ENVY'S CRUEL BLOW
FIRST SOMEWHAT PAUSING TILL THE MOURNFUL WORDS
WERE ENDED THEN TO ME THE BARD BEGAN
LOSE NOT THE TIME BUT SPEAK AND OF HIM ASK
IF MORE THOU WISH TO LEARN WHENCE I REPLIED
QUESTION THOU HIM AGAIN OF WHATSOE'ER
WILL AS THOU THINK'ST CONTENT ME FOR NO POWER
HAVE I TO ASK SUCH PITY' IS AT MY HEART
HE THUS RESUM'D SO MAY HE DO FOR THEE
FREELY WHAT THOU ENTREATEST AS THOU YET
BE PLEAS'D IMPRISON'D SPIRIT TO DECLARE
HOW IN THESE GNARLED JOINTS THE SOUL IS TIED
AND WHETHER ANY EVER FROM SUCH FRAME
BE LOOSEN'D IF THOU CANST THAT ALSO TELL
THEREAT THE TRUNK BREATH'D HARD AND THE WIND SOON
CHANG'D INTO SOUNDS ARTICULATE LIKE THESE
BRIEFLY YE SHALL BE ANSWER'D
WHEN DEPARTS
THE FIERCE SOUL FROM THE BODY BY ITSELF
THENCE TORN ASUNDER TO THE SEVENTH GULF
BY MINOS DOOM'D INTO THE WOOD IT FALLS
NO PLACE ASSIGN'D BUT WHERESOEVER CHANCE
HURLS IT THERE SPROUTING AS A GRAIN OF SPELT
IT RISES TO A SAPLING GROWING THENCE
A SAVAGE PLANT
THE HARPIES ON ITS LEAVES
THEN FEEDING CAUSE BOTH PAIN AND FOR THE PAIN
A VENT TO GRIEF
WE AS THE REST SHALL COME
FOR OUR OWN SPOILS YET NOT SO THAT WITH THEM
WE MAY AGAIN BE CLAD FOR WHAT A MAN
TAKES FROM HIMSELF IT IS NOT JUST HE HAVE
HERE WE PERFORCE SHALL DRAG THEM AND THROUGHOUT
THE DISMAL GLADE OUR BODIES SHALL BE HUNG
EACH ON THE WILD THORN OF HIS WRETCHED SHADE
ATTENTIVE YET TO LISTEN TO THE TRUNK
WE STOOD EXPECTING FARTHER SPEECH WHEN US
A NOISE SURPRIS'D AS WHEN A MAN PERCEIVES
THE WILD BOAR AND THE HUNT APPROACH HIS PLACE
OF STATION'D WATCH WHO OF THE BEASTS AND BOUGHS
LOUD RUSTLING ROUND HIM HEARS
AND LO THERE CAME
TWO NAKED TORN WITH BRIERS IN HEADLONG FLIGHT
THAT THEY BEFORE THEM BROKE EACH FAN O' TH' WOOD
HASTE NOW THE FOREMOST CRIED NOW HASTE THEE DEATH
THE' OTHER AS SEEM'D IMPATIENT OF DELAY
EXCLAIMING LANO NOT SO BENT FOR SPEED
THY SINEWS IN THE LISTS OF TOPPO'S FIELD
AND THEN FOR THAT PERCHANCE NO LONGER BREATH
SUFFIC'D HIM OF HIMSELF AND OF A BUSH
ONE GROUP HE MADE
BEHIND THEM WAS THE WOOD
FULL OF BLACK FEMALE MASTIFFS GAUNT AND FLEET
AS GREYHOUNDS THAT HAVE NEWLY SLIPP'D THE LEASH
ON HIM WHO SQUATTED DOWN THEY STUCK THEIR FANGS
AND HAVING RENT HIM PIECEMEAL BORE AWAY
THE TORTUR'D LIMBS
MY GUIDE THEN SEIZ'D MY HAND
AND LED ME TO THE THICKET WHICH IN VAIN
MOURN'D THROUGH ITS BLEEDING WOUNDS O GIACOMO
OF SANT' ANDREA WHAT AVAILS IT THEE
IT CRIED THAT OF ME THOU HAST MADE THY SCREEN
FOR THY ILL LIFE WHAT BLAME ON ME RECOILS
WHEN O'ER IT HE HAD PAUS'D MY MASTER SPAKE
SAY WHO WAST THOU THAT AT SO MANY POINTS
BREATH'ST OUT WITH BLOOD THY LAMENTABLE SPEECH
HE ANSWER'D OH YE SPIRITS ARRIV'D IN TIME
TO SPY THE SHAMEFUL HAVOC THAT FROM ME
MY LEAVES HATH SEVER'D THUS GATHER THEM UP
AND AT THE FOOT OF THEIR SAD PARENT TREE
CAREFULLY LAY THEM
IN THAT CITY' I DWELT
WHO FOR THE BAPTIST HER FIRST PATRON CHANG'D
WHENCE HE FOR THIS SHALL CEASE NOT WITH HIS ART
TO WORK HER WOE AND IF THERE STILL REMAIN'D NOT
ON ARNO'S PASSAGE SOME FAINT GLIMPSE OF HIM
THOSE CITIZENS WHO REAR'D ONCE MORE HER WALLS
UPON THE ASHES LEFT BY ATTILA
HAD LABOUR'D WITHOUT PROFIT OF THEIR TOIL
I SLUNG THE FATAL NOOSE FROM MY OWN ROOF
CANTO XIV
SOON AS THE CHARITY OF NATIVE LAND
WROUGHT IN MY BOSOM I THE SCATTER'D LEAVES
COLLECTED AND TO HIM RESTOR'D WHO NOW
WAS HOARSE WITH UTT'RANCE
TO THE LIMIT THENCE
WE CAME WHICH FROM THE THIRD THE SECOND ROUND
DIVIDES AND WHERE OF JUSTICE IS DISPLAY'D
CONTRIVANCE HORRIBLE
THINGS THEN FIRST SEEN
CLEARLIER TO MANIFEST I TELL HOW NEXT
A PLAIN WE REACH'D THAT FROM ITS STERILE BED
EACH PLANT REPELL'D
THE MOURNFUL WOOD WAVES ROUND
ITS GARLAND ON ALL SIDES AS ROUND THE WOOD
SPREADS THE SAD FOSS
THERE ON THE VERY EDGE
OUR STEPS WE STAY'D
IT WAS AN AREA WIDE
OF ARID SAND AND THICK RESEMBLING MOST
THE SOIL THAT ERST BY CATO'S FOOT WAS TROD
VENGEANCE OF HEAV'N OH HOW SHOULDST THOU BE FEAR'D
BY ALL WHO READ WHAT HERE MY EYES BEHELD
OF NAKED SPIRITS MANY A FLOCK I SAW
ALL WEEPING PITEOUSLY TO DIFFERENT LAWS
SUBJECTED FOR ON THE' EARTH SOME LAY SUPINE
SOME CROUCHING CLOSE WERE SEATED OTHERS PAC'D
INCESSANTLY AROUND THE LATTER TRIBE
MORE NUMEROUS THOSE FEWER WHO BENEATH
THE TORMENT LAY BUT LOUDER IN THEIR GRIEF
O'ER ALL THE SAND FELL SLOWLY WAFTING DOWN
DILATED FLAKES OF FIRE AS FLAKES OF SNOW
ON ALPINE SUMMIT WHEN THE WIND IS HUSH'D
AS IN THE TORRID INDIAN CLIME THE SON
OF AMMON SAW UPON HIS WARRIOR BAND
DESCENDING SOLID FLAMES THAT TO THE GROUND
CAME DOWN WHENCE HE BETHOUGHT HIM WITH HIS TROOP
TO TRAMPLE ON THE SOIL FOR EASIER THUS
THE VAPOUR WAS EXTINGUISH'D WHILE ALONE
SO FELL THE ETERNAL FIERY FLOOD WHEREWITH
THE MARBLE GLOW'D UNDERNEATH AS UNDER STOVE
THE VIANDS DOUBLY TO AUGMENT THE PAIN
UNCEASING WAS THE PLAY OF WRETCHED HANDS
NOW THIS NOW THAT WAY GLANCING TO SHAKE OFF
THE HEAT STILL FALLING FRESH
I THUS BEGAN
INSTRUCTOR THOU WHO ALL THINGS OVERCOM'ST
EXCEPT THE HARDY DEMONS THAT RUSH'D FORTH
TO STOP OUR ENTRANCE AT THE GATE SAY WHO
IS YON HUGE SPIRIT THAT AS SEEMS HEEDS NOT
THE BURNING BUT LIES WRITHEN IN PROUD SCORN
AS BY THE SULTRY TEMPEST IMMATUR'D
STRAIGHT HE HIMSELF WHO WAS AWARE I ASK'D
MY GUIDE OF HIM EXCLAIM'D SUCH AS I WAS
WHEN LIVING DEAD SUCH NOW I AM
IF JOVE
WEARY HIS WORKMAN OUT FROM WHOM IN IRE
HE SNATCH'D THE LIGHTNINGS THAT AT MY LAST DAY
TRANSFIX'D ME IF THE REST BE WEARY OUT
AT THEIR BLACK SMITHY LABOURING BY TURNS
IN MONGIBELLO WHILE HE CRIES ALOUD
HELP HELP GOOD MULCIBER AS ERST HE CRIED
IN THE PHLEGRAEAN WARFARE AND THE BOLTS
LAUNCH HE FULL AIM'D AT ME WITH ALL HIS MIGHT
HE NEVER SHOULD ENJOY A SWEET REVENGE
THEN THUS MY GUIDE IN ACCENT HIGHER RAIS'D
THAN I BEFORE HAD HEARD HIM CAPANEUS
THOU ART MORE PUNISH'D IN THAT THIS THY PRIDE
LIVES YET UNQUENCH'D NO TORRENT SAVE THY RAGE
WERE TO THY FURY PAIN PROPORTION'D FULL
NEXT TURNING ROUND TO ME WITH MILDER LIP
HE SPAKE THIS OF THE SEVEN KINGS WAS ONE
WHO GIRT THE THEBAN WALLS WITH SIEGE AND HELD
AS STILL HE SEEMS TO HOLD GOD IN DISDAIN
AND SETS HIS HIGH OMNIPOTENCE AT NOUGHT
BUT AS I TOLD HIM HIS DESPITEFUL MOOD
IS ORNAMENT WELL SUITS THE BREAST THAT WEARS IT
FOLLOW ME NOW AND LOOK THOU SET NOT YET
THY FOOT IN THE HOT SAND BUT TO THE WOOD
KEEP EVER CLOSE SILENTLY ON WE PASS'D
TO WHERE THERE GUSHES FROM THE FOREST'S BOUND
A LITTLE BROOK WHOSE CRIMSON'D WAVE YET LIFTS
MY HAIR WITH HORROR
AS THE RILL THAT RUNS
FROM BULICAME TO BE PORTION'D OUT
AMONG THE SINFUL WOMEN SO RAN THIS
DOWN THROUGH THE SAND ITS BOTTOM AND EACH BANK
STONE BUILT AND EITHER MARGIN AT ITS SIDE
WHEREON I STRAIGHT PERCEIV'D OUR PASSAGE LAY
OF ALL THAT I HAVE SHOWN THEE SINCE THAT GATE
WE ENTER'D FIRST WHOSE THRESHOLD IS TO NONE
DENIED NOUGHT ELSE SO WORTHY OF REGARD
AS IS THIS RIVER HAS THINE EYE DISCERN'D
O'ER WHICH THE FLAMING VOLLEY ALL IS QUENCH'D
SO SPAKE MY GUIDE AND I HIM THENCE BESOUGHT
THAT HAVING GIV'N ME APPETITE TO KNOW
THE FOOD HE TOO WOULD GIVE THAT HUNGER CRAV'D
IN MIDST OF OCEAN FORTHWITH HE BEGAN
A DESOLATE COUNTRY LIES WHICH CRETE IS NAM'D
UNDER WHOSE MONARCH IN OLD TIMES THE WORLD
LIV'D PURE AND CHASTE
A MOUNTAIN RISES THERE
CALL'D IDA JOYOUS ONCE WITH LEAVES AND STREAMS
DESERTED NOW LIKE A FORBIDDEN THING
IT WAS THE SPOT WHICH RHEA SATURN'S SPOUSE
CHOSE FOR THE SECRET CRADLE OF HER SON
AND BETTER TO CONCEAL HIM DROWN'D IN SHOUTS
HIS INFANT CRIES
WITHIN THE MOUNT UPRIGHT
AN ANCIENT FORM THERE STANDS AND HUGE THAT TURNS
HIS SHOULDERS TOWARDS DAMIATA AND AT ROME
AS IN HIS MIRROR LOOKS
OF FINEST GOLD
HIS HEAD IS SHAP'D PURE SILVER ARE THE BREAST
AND ARMS THENCE TO THE MIDDLE IS OF BRASS
AND DOWNWARD ALL BENEATH WELL TEMPER'D STEEL
SAVE THE RIGHT FOOT OF POTTER'S CLAY ON WHICH
THAN ON THE OTHER MORE ERECT HE STANDS
EACH PART EXCEPT THE GOLD IS RENT THROUGHOUT
AND FROM THE FISSURE TEARS DISTIL WHICH JOIN'D
PENETRATE TO THAT CAVE
THEY IN THEIR COURSE
THUS FAR PRECIPITATED DOWN THE ROCK
FORM ACHERON AND STYX AND PHLEGETHON
THEN BY THIS STRAITEN'D CHANNEL PASSING HENCE
BENEATH E'EN TO THE LOWEST DEPTH OF ALL
FORM THERE COCYTUS OF WHOSE LAKE THYSELF
SHALL SEE IT I HERE GIVE THEE NO ACCOUNT
THEN I TO HIM IF FROM OUR WORLD THIS SLUICE
BE THUS DERIV'D WHEREFORE TO US BUT NOW
APPEARS IT AT THIS EDGE HE STRAIGHT REPLIED
THE PLACE THOU KNOW'ST IS ROUND AND THOUGH GREAT PART
THOU HAVE ALREADY PASS'D STILL TO THE LEFT
DESCENDING TO THE NETHERMOST NOT YET
HAST THOU THE CIRCUIT MADE OF THE WHOLE ORB
WHEREFORE IF AUGHT OF NEW TO US APPEAR
IT NEEDS NOT BRING UP WONDER IN THY LOOKS
THEN I AGAIN INQUIR'D WHERE FLOW THE STREAMS
OF PHLEGETHON AND LETHE FOR OF ONE

DOUBTLESS THY QUESTIONS ALL WELL PLEAS'D I HEAR
YET THE RED SEETHING WAVE MIGHT HAVE RESOLV'D
ONE THOU PROPOSEST
LETHE THOU SHALT SEE
BUT NOT WITHIN THIS HOLLOW IN THE PLACE
WHITHER TO LAVE THEMSELVES THE SPIRITS GO
WHOSE BLAME HATH BEEN BY PENITENCE REMOV'D
HE ADDED TIME IS NOW WE QUIT THE WOOD
LOOK THOU MY STEPS PURSUE THE MARGINS GIVE
SAFE PASSAGE UNIMPEDED BY THE FLAMES
FOR OVER THEM ALL VAPOUR IS EXTINCT
CANTO XV
ONE OF THE SOLID MARGINS BEARS US NOW
ENVELOP'D IN THE MIST THAT FROM THE STREAM
ARISING HOVERS O'ER AND SAVES FROM FIRE
BOTH PIERS AND WATER
AS THE FLEMINGS REAR
THEIR MOUND 'TWIXT GHENT AND BRUGES TO CHASE BACK
THE OCEAN FEARING HIS TUMULTUOUS TIDE
THAT DRIVES TOWARD THEM OR THE PADUANS THEIRS
ALONG THE BRENTA TO DEFEND THEIR TOWNS
AND CASTLES ERE THE GENIAL WARMTH BE FELT
ON CHIARENTANA'S TOP SUCH WERE THE MOUNDS
SO FRAM'D THOUGH NOT IN HEIGHT OR BULK TO THESE
MADE EQUAL BY THE MASTER WHOSOE'ER
HE WAS THAT RAIS'D THEM HERE
WE FROM THE WOOD
WERE NOT SO FAR REMOV'D THAT TURNING ROUND
I MIGHT NOT HAVE DISCERN'D IT WHEN WE MET
A TROOP OF SPIRITS WHO CAME BESIDE THE PIER
THEY EACH ONE EY'D US AS AT EVENTIDE
ONE EYES ANOTHER UNDER A NEW MOON
AND TOWARD US SHARPEN'D THEIR SIGHT AS KEEN
AS AN OLD TAILOR AT HIS NEEDLE'S EYE
THUS NARROWLY EXPLOR'D BY ALL THE TRIBE
I WAS AGNIZ'D OF ONE WHO BY THE SKIRT
CAUGHT ME AND CRIED WHAT WONDER HAVE WE HERE
AND I WHEN HE TO ME OUTSTRETCH'D HIS ARM
INTENTLY FIX'D MY KEN ON HIS PARCH'D LOOKS
THAT ALTHOUGH SMIRCH'D WITH FIRE THEY HINDER'D NOT
BUT I REMEMBER'D HIM AND TOWARDS HIS FACE
MY HAND INCLINING ANSWER'D SIR BRUNETTO
AND ART THOU HERE HE THUS TO ME MY SON
OH LET IT NOT DISPLEASE THEE IF BRUNETTO
LATINI BUT A LITTLE SPACE WITH THEE
TURN BACK AND LEAVE HIS FELLOWS TO PROCEED

THAT I HERE SEAT ME WITH THEE I CONSENT
HIS LEAVE WITH WHOM I JOURNEY FIRST OBTAIN'D
O SON SAID HE WHOEVER OF THIS THRONG
ONE INSTANT STOPS LIES THEN A HUNDRED YEARS
NO FAN TO VENTILATE HIM WHEN THE FIRE
SMITES SOREST
PASS THOU THEREFORE ON
I CLOSE
WILL AT THY GARMENTS WALK AND THEN REJOIN
MY TROOP WHO GO MOURNING THEIR ENDLESS DOOM
I DAR'D NOT FROM THE PATH DESCEND TO TREAD
ON EQUAL GROUND WITH HIM BUT HELD MY HEAD
BENT DOWN AS ONE WHO WALKS IN REVERENT GUISE
WHAT CHANCE OR DESTINY THUS HE BEGAN
ERE THE LAST DAY CONDUCTS THEE HERE BELOW
AND WHO IS THIS THAT SHOWS TO THEE THE WAY
THERE UP ALOFT I ANSWER'D IN THE LIFE
SERENE I WANDER'D IN A VALLEY LOST
BEFORE MINE AGE HAD TO ITS FULLNESS REACH'D
BUT YESTER MORN I LEFT IT THEN ONCE MORE
INTO THAT VALE RETURNING HIM I MET
AND BY THIS PATH HOMEWARD HE LEADS ME BACK
IF THOU HE ANSWER'D FOLLOW BUT THY STAR
THOU CANST NOT MISS AT LAST A GLORIOUS HAVEN
UNLESS IN FAIRER DAYS MY JUDGMENT ERR'D
AND IF MY FATE SO EARLY HAD NOT CHANC'D
SEEING THE HEAV'NS THUS BOUNTEOUS TO THEE I
HAD GLADLY GIV'N THEE COMFORT IN THY WORK
BUT THAT UNGRATEFUL AND MALIGNANT RACE
WHO IN OLD TIMES CAME DOWN FROM FESOLE
AY AND STILL SMACK OF THEIR ROUGH MOUNTAIN FLINT
WILL FOR THY GOOD DEEDS SHEW THEE ENMITY
NOR WONDER FOR AMONGST ILL SAVOUR'D CRABS
IT SUITS NOT THE SWEET FIG TREE LAY HER FRUIT
OLD FAME REPORTS THEM IN THE WORLD FOR BLIND
COVETOUS ENVIOUS PROUD
LOOK TO IT WELL
TAKE HEED THOU CLEANSE THEE OF THEIR WAYS
FOR THEE
THY FORTUNE HATH SUCH HONOUR IN RESERVE
THAT THOU BY EITHER PARTY SHALT BE CRAV'D
WITH HUNGER KEEN BUT BE THE FRESH HERB FAR
FROM THE GOAT'S TOOTH
THE HERD OF FESOLE
MAY OF THEMSELVES MAKE LITTER NOT TOUCH THE PLANT
IF ANY SUCH YET SPRING ON THEIR RANK BED
IN WHICH THE HOLY SEED REVIVES TRANSMITTED
FROM THOSE TRUE ROMANS WHO STILL THERE REMAIN'D
WHEN IT WAS MADE THE NEST OF SO MUCH ILL
WERE ALL MY WISH FULFILL'D I STRAIGHT REPLIED
THOU FROM THE CONFINES OF MAN'S NATURE YET
HADST NOT BEEN DRIVEN FORTH FOR IN MY MIND
IS FIX'D AND NOW STRIKES FULL UPON MY HEART
THE DEAR BENIGN PATERNAL IMAGE SUCH
AS THINE WAS WHEN SO LATELY THOU DIDST TEACH ME
THE WAY FOR MAN TO WIN ETERNITY
AND HOW I PRIZ'D THE LESSON IT BEHOOVES
THAT LONG AS LIFE ENDURES MY TONGUE SHOULD SPEAK
WHAT OF MY FATE THOU TELL'ST THAT WRITE I DOWN
AND WITH ANOTHER TEXT TO COMMENT ON
FOR HER I KEEP IT THE CELESTIAL DAME
WHO WILL KNOW ALL IF I TO HER ARRIVE
THIS ONLY WOULD I HAVE THEE CLEARLY NOTE
THAT SO MY CONSCIENCE HAVE NO PLEA AGAINST ME
DO FORTUNE AS SHE LIST I STAND PREPAR'D
NOT NEW OR STRANGE SUCH EARNEST TO MINE EAR
SPEED FORTUNE THEN HER WHEEL AS LIKES HER BEST
THE CLOWN HIS MATTOCK ALL THINGS HAVE THEIR COURSE
THEREAT MY SAPIENT GUIDE UPON HIS RIGHT
TURN'D HIMSELF BACK THEN LOOK'D AT ME AND SPAKE
HE LISTENS TO GOOD PURPOSE WHO TAKES NOTE
I NOT THE LESS STILL ON MY WAY PROCEED
DISCOURSING WITH BRUNETTO AND INQUIRE
WHO ARE MOST KNOWN AND CHIEF AMONG HIS TRIBE
TO KNOW OF SOME IS WELL THUS HE REPLIED
BUT OF THE REST SILENCE MAY BEST BESEEM
TIME WOULD NOT SERVE US FOR REPORT SO LONG
IN BRIEF I TELL THEE THAT ALL THESE WERE CLERKS
MEN OF GREAT LEARNING AND NO LESS RENOWN
BY ONE SAME SIN POLLUTED IN THE WORLD
WITH THEM IS PRISCIAN AND ACCORSO'S SON
FRANCESCO HERDS AMONG THAT WRETCHED THRONG
AND IF THE WISH OF SO IMPURE A BLOTCH
POSSESS'D THEE HIM THOU ALSO MIGHT'ST HAVE SEEN
WHO BY THE SERVANTS' SERVANT WAS TRANSFERR'D
FROM ARNO'S SEAT TO BACCHIGLIONE WHERE
HIS ILL STRAIN'D NERVES HE LEFT
I MORE WOULD ADD
BUT MUST FROM FARTHER SPEECH AND ONWARD WAY
ALIKE DESIST FOR YONDER I BEHOLD
A MIST NEW RISEN ON THE SANDY PLAIN
A COMPANY WITH WHOM I MAY NOT SORT
APPROACHES
I COMMEND MY TREASURE TO THEE
WHEREIN I YET SURVIVE MY SOLE REQUEST
THIS SAID HE TURN'D AND SEEM'D AS ONE OF THOSE
WHO O'ER VERONA'S CHAMPAIN TRY THEIR SPEED
FOR THE GREEN MANTLE AND OF THEM HE SEEM'D
NOT HE WHO LOSES BUT WHO GAINS THE PRIZE
CANTO XVI
NOW CAME I WHERE THE WATER'S DIN WAS HEARD
AS DOWN IT FELL INTO THE OTHER ROUND
RESOUNDING LIKE THE HUM OF SWARMING BEES
WHEN FORTH TOGETHER ISSU'D FROM A TROOP
THAT PASS'D BENEATH THE FIERCE TORMENTING STORM
THREE SPIRITS RUNNING SWIFT
THEY TOWARDS US CAME
AND EACH ONE CRIED ALOUD OH DO THOU STAY
WHOM BY THE FASHION OF THY GARB WE DEEM
TO BE SOME INMATE OF OUR EVIL LAND
AH ME WHAT WOUNDS I MARK'D UPON THEIR LIMBS
RECENT AND OLD INFLICTED BY THE FLAMES
E'EN THE REMEMBRANCE OF THEM GRIEVES ME YET
ATTENTIVE TO THEIR CRY MY TEACHER PAUS'D
AND TURN'D TO ME HIS VISAGE AND THEN SPAKE
WAIT NOW OUR COURTESY THESE MERIT WELL
AND WERE 'T NOT FOR THE NATURE OF THE PLACE
WHENCE GLIDE THE FIERY DARTS I SHOULD HAVE SAID
THAT HASTE HAD BETTER SUITED THEE THAN THEM
THEY WHEN WE STOPP'D RESUM'D THEIR ANCIENT WAIL
AND SOON AS THEY HAD REACH'D US ALL THE THREE
WHIRL'D ROUND TOGETHER IN ONE RESTLESS WHEEL
AS NAKED CHAMPIONS SMEAR'D WITH SLIPPERY OIL
ARE WONT INTENT TO WATCH THEIR PLACE OF HOLD
AND VANTAGE ERE IN CLOSER STRIFE THEY MEET
THUS EACH ONE AS HE WHEEL'D HIS COUNTENANCE
AT ME DIRECTED SO THAT OPPOSITE
THE NECK MOV'D EVER TO THE TWINKLING FEET
IF MISERY OF THIS DREAR WILDERNESS
THUS ONE BEGAN ADDED TO OUR SAD CHEER
AND DESTITUTE DO CALL FORTH SCORN ON US
AND OUR ENTREATIES LET OUR GREAT RENOWN
INCLINE THEE TO INFORM US WHO THOU ART
THAT DOST IMPRINT WITH LIVING FEET UNHARM'D
THE SOIL OF HELL
HE IN WHOSE TRACK THOU SEE'ST
MY STEPS PURSUING NAKED THOUGH HE BE
AND REFT OF ALL WAS OF MORE HIGH ESTATE
THAN THOU BELIEVEST GRANDCHILD OF THE CHASTE
GUALDRADA HIM THEY GUIDOGUERRA CALL'D
WHO IN HIS LIFETIME MANY A NOBLE ACT
ACHIEV'D BOTH BY HIS WISDOM AND HIS SWORD
THE OTHER NEXT TO ME THAT BEATS THE SAND
IS ALDOBRANDI NAME DESERVING WELL
IN THE' UPPER WORLD OF HONOUR AND MYSELF
WHO IN THIS TORMENT DO PARTAKE WITH THEM
AM RUSTICUCCI WHOM PAST DOUBT MY WIFE
OF SAVAGE TEMPER MORE THAN AUGHT BESIDE
HATH TO THIS EVIL BROUGHT IF FROM THE FIRE
I HAD BEEN SHELTER'D DOWN AMIDST THEM STRAIGHT
I THEN HAD CAST ME NOR MY GUIDE I DEEM
WOULD HAVE RESTRAIN'D MY GOING BUT THAT FEAR
OF THE DIRE BURNING VANQUISH'D THE DESIRE
WHICH MADE ME EAGER OF THEIR WISH'D EMBRACE
I THEN BEGAN NOT SCORN BUT GRIEF MUCH MORE
SUCH AS LONG TIME ALONE CAN CURE YOUR DOOM
FIX'D DEEP WITHIN ME SOON AS THIS MY LORD
SPAKE WORDS WHOSE TENOUR TAUGHT ME TO EXPECT
THAT SUCH A RACE AS YE ARE WAS AT HAND
I AM A COUNTRYMAN OF YOURS WHO STILL
AFFECTIONATE HAVE UTTER'D AND HAVE HEARD
YOUR DEEDS AND NAMES RENOWN'D
LEAVING THE GALL
FOR THE SWEET FRUIT I GO THAT A SURE GUIDE
HATH PROMIS'D TO ME

AS TO THE CENTRE FIRST I DOWNWARD TEND
SO MAY LONG SPACE THY SPIRIT GUIDE THY LIMBS
HE ANSWER STRAIGHT RETURN'D AND SO THY FAME
SHINE BRIGHT WHEN THOU ART GONE AS THOU SHALT TELL
IF COURTESY AND VALOUR AS THEY WONT
DWELL IN OUR CITY OR HAVE VANISH'D CLEAN
FOR ONE AMIDST US LATE CONDEMN'D TO WAIL
BORSIERE YONDER WALKING WITH HIS PEERS
GRIEVES US NO LITTLE BY THE NEWS HE BRINGS
AN UPSTART MULTITUDE AND SUDDEN GAINS
PRIDE AND EXCESS O FLORENCE HAVE IN THEE
ENGENDER'D SO THAT NOW IN TEARS THOU MOURN'ST
THUS CRIED I WITH MY FACE UPRAIS'D AND THEY
ALL THREE WHO FOR AN ANSWER TOOK MY WORDS
LOOK'D AT EACH OTHER AS MEN LOOK WHEN TRUTH
COMES TO THEIR EAR
IF THOU AT OTHER TIMES
THEY ALL AT ONCE REJOIN'D SO EASILY
SATISFY THOSE WHO QUESTION HAPPY THOU
GIFTED WITH WORDS SO APT TO SPEAK THY THOUGHT
WHEREFORE IF THOU ESCAPE THIS DARKSOME CLIME
RETURNING TO BEHOLD THE RADIANT STARS
WHEN THOU WITH PLEASURE SHALT RETRACE THE PAST
SEE THAT OF US THOU SPEAK AMONG MANKIND
THIS SAID THEY BROKE THE CIRCLE AND SO SWIFT
FLED THAT AS PINIONS SEEM'D THEIR NIMBLE FEET
NOT IN SO SHORT A TIME MIGHT ONE HAVE SAID
AMEN AS THEY HAD VANISH'D
STRAIGHT MY GUIDE
PURSU'D HIS TRACK
I FOLLOW'D AND SMALL SPACE
HAD WE PASS'D ONWARD WHEN THE WATER'S SOUND
WAS NOW SO NEAR AT HAND THAT WE HAD SCARCE
HEARD ONE ANOTHER'S SPEECH FOR THE LOUD DIN
E'EN AS THE RIVER THAT HOLDS ON ITS COURSE
UNMINGLED FROM THE MOUNT OF VESULO
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF APENNINE TOWARD
THE EAST WHICH ACQUACHETA HIGHER UP
THEY CALL ERE IT DESCEND INTO THE VALE
AT FORLI BY THAT NAME NO LONGER KNOWN
REBELLOWS O'ER SAINT BENEDICT ROLL'D ON
FROM THE' ALPINE SUMMIT DOWN A PRECIPICE
WHERE SPACE ENOUGH TO LODGE A THOUSAND SPREADS
THUS DOWNWARD FROM A CRAGGY STEEP WE FOUND
THAT THIS DARK WAVE RESOUNDED ROARING LOUD
SO THAT THE EAR ITS CLAMOUR SOON HAD STUNN'D
I HAD A CORD THAT BRAC'D MY GIRDLE ROUND
WHEREWITH I ERST HAD THOUGHT FAST BOUND TO TAKE
THE PAINTED LEOPARD
THIS WHEN I HAD ALL
UNLOOSEN'D FROM ME SO MY MASTER BADE
I GATHER'D UP AND STRETCH'D IT FORTH TO HIM
THEN TO THE RIGHT HE TURN'D AND FROM THE BRINK
STANDING FEW PACES DISTANT CAST IT DOWN
INTO THE DEEP ABYSS
AND SOMEWHAT STRANGE
THUS TO MYSELF I SPAKE SIGNAL SO STRANGE
BETOKENS WHICH MY GUIDE WITH EARNEST EYE
THUS FOLLOWS AH WHAT CAUTION MUST MEN USE
WITH THOSE WHO LOOK NOT AT THE DEED ALONE
BUT SPY INTO THE THOUGHTS WITH SUBTLE SKILL
QUICKLY SHALL COME HE SAID WHAT I EXPECT
THINE EYE DISCOVER QUICKLY THAT WHEREOF
THY THOUGHT IS DREAMING EVER TO THAT TRUTH
WHICH BUT THE SEMBLANCE OF A FALSEHOOD WEARS
A MAN IF POSSIBLE SHOULD BAR HIS LIP
SINCE ALTHOUGH BLAMELESS HE INCURS REPROACH
BUT SILENCE HERE WERE VAIN AND BY THESE NOTES
WHICH NOW I SING READER I SWEAR TO THEE
SO MAY THEY FAVOUR FIND TO LATEST TIMES
THAT THROUGH THE GROSS AND MURKY AIR I SPIED
A SHAPE COME SWIMMING UP THAT MIGHT HAVE QUELL'D
THE STOUTEST HEART WITH WONDER IN SUCH GUISE
AS ONE RETURNS WHO HATH BEEN DOWN TO LOOSE
AN ANCHOR GRAPPLED FAST AGAINST SOME ROCK
OR TO AUGHT ELSE THAT IN THE SALT WAVE LIES
WHO UPWARD SPRINGING CLOSE DRAWS IN HIS FEET
CANTO XVII
LO THE FELL MONSTER WITH THE DEADLY STING
WHO PASSES MOUNTAINS BREAKS THROUGH FENCED WALLS
AND FIRM EMBATTLED SPEARS AND WITH HIS FILTH
TAINTS ALL THE WORLD THUS ME MY GUIDE ADDRESS'D
AND BECKON'D HIM THAT HE SHOULD COME TO SHORE
NEAR TO THE STONY CAUSEWAY'S UTMOST EDGE
FORTHWITH THAT IMAGE VILE OF FRAUD APPEAR'D
HIS HEAD AND UPPER PART EXPOS'D ON LAND
BUT LAID NOT ON THE SHORE HIS BESTIAL TRAIN
HIS FACE THE SEMBLANCE OF A JUST MAN'S WORE
SO KIND AND GRACIOUS WAS ITS OUTWARD CHEER
THE REST WAS SERPENT ALL TWO SHAGGY CLAWS
REACH'D TO THE ARMPITS AND THE BACK AND BREAST
AND EITHER SIDE WERE PAINTED O'ER WITH NODES
AND ORBITS
COLOURS VARIEGATED MORE
NOR TURKS NOR TARTARS E'ER ON CLOTH OF STATE
WITH INTERCHANGEABLE EMBROIDERY WOVE
NOR SPREAD ARACHNE O'ER HER CURIOUS LOOM
AS OFTTIMES A LIGHT SKIFF MOOR'D TO THE SHORE
STANDS PART IN WATER PART UPON THE LAND
OR AS WHERE DWELLS THE GREEDY GERMAN BOOR
THE BEAVER SETTLES WATCHING FOR HIS PREY
SO ON THE RIM THAT FENC'D THE SAND WITH ROCK
SAT PERCH'D THE FIEND OF EVIL
IN THE VOID
GLANCING HIS TAIL UPTURN'D ITS VENOMOUS FORK
WITH STING LIKE SCORPION'S ARM'D
THEN THUS MY GUIDE
NOW NEED OUR WAY MUST TURN FEW STEPS APART
FAR AS TO THAT ILL BEAST WHO COUCHES THERE
THEREAT TOWARD THE RIGHT OUR DOWNWARD COURSE
WE SHAP'D AND BETTER TO ESCAPE THE FLAME
AND BURNING MARLE TEN PACES ON THE VERGE
PROCEEDED
SOON AS WE TO HIM ARRIVE
A LITTLE FURTHER ON MINE EYE BEHOLDS
A TRIBE OF SPIRITS SEATED ON THE SAND
NEAR THE WIDE CHASM
FORTHWITH MY MASTER SPAKE
THAT TO THE FULL THY KNOWLEDGE MAY EXTEND
OF ALL THIS ROUND CONTAINS GO NOW AND MARK
THE MIEN THESE WEAR BUT HOLD NOT LONG DISCOURSE
TILL THOU RETURNEST I WITH HIM MEANTIME
WILL PARLEY THAT TO US HE MAY VOUCHSAFE
THE AID OF HIS STRONG SHOULDERS THUS ALONE
YET FORWARD ON THE' EXTREMITY I PAC'D
OF THAT SEVENTH CIRCLE WHERE THE MOURNFUL TRIBE
WERE SEATED
AT THE EYES FORTH GUSH'D THEIR PANGS
AGAINST THE VAPOURS AND THE TORRID SOIL
ALTERNATELY THEIR SHIFTING HANDS THEY PLIED
THUS USE THE DOGS IN SUMMER STILL TO PLY
THEIR JAWS AND FEET BY TURNS WHEN BITTEN SORE
BY GNATS OR FLIES OR GADFLIES SWARMING ROUND
NOTING THE VISAGES OF SOME WHO LAY
BENEATH THE PELTING OF THAT DOLOROUS FIRE
ONE OF THEM ALL I KNEW NOT BUT PERCEIV'D
THAT PENDENT FROM HIS NECK EACH BORE A POUCH
WITH COLOURS AND WITH EMBLEMS VARIOUS MARK'D
ON WHICH IT SEEM'D AS IF THEIR EYE DID FEED
AND WHEN AMONGST THEM LOOKING ROUND I CAME
A YELLOW PURSE I SAW WITH AZURE WROUGHT
THAT WORE A LION'S COUNTENANCE AND PORT
THEN STILL MY SIGHT PURSUING ITS CAREER
ANOTHER I BEHELD THAN BLOOD MORE RED
A GOOSE DISPLAY OF WHITER WING THAN CURD
AND ONE WHO BORE A FAT AND AZURE SWINE
PICTUR'D ON HIS WHITE SCRIP ADDRESSED ME THUS
WHAT DOST THOU IN THIS DEEP GO NOW AND KNOW
SINCE YET THOU LIVEST THAT MY NEIGHBOUR HERE
VITALIANO ON MY LEFT SHALL SIT
A PADUAN WITH THESE FLORENTINES AM I
OFTTIMES THEY THUNDER IN MINE EARS EXCLAIMING
'O HASTE THAT NOBLE KNIGHT HE WHO THE POUCH
WITH THE THREE BEAKS WILL BRING THIS SAID HE WRITH'D
THE MOUTH AND LOLL'D THE TONGUE OUT LIKE AN OX
THAT LICKS HIS NOSTRILS
I LEST LONGER STAY
HE ILL MIGHT BROOK WHO BADE ME STAY NOT LONG
BACKWARD MY STEPS FROM THOSE SAD SPIRITS TURN'D
MY GUIDE ALREADY SEATED ON THE HAUNCH
OF THE FIERCE ANIMAL I FOUND AND THUS
HE ME ENCOURAG'D
BE THOU STOUT BE BOLD
DOWN SUCH A STEEP FLIGHT MUST WE NOW DESCEND
MOUNT THOU BEFORE FOR THAT NO POWER THE TAIL
MAY HAVE TO HARM THEE I WILL BE I' TH' MIDST
AS ONE WHO HATH AN AGUE FIT SO NEAR
HIS NAILS ALREADY ARE TURN'D BLUE AND HE
QUIVERS ALL O'ER IF HE BUT EYE THE SHADE
SUCH WAS MY CHEER AT HEARING OF HIS WORDS
BUT SHAME SOON INTERPOS'D HER THREAT WHO MAKES
THE SERVANT BOLD IN PRESENCE OF HIS LORD
I SETTLED ME UPON THOSE SHOULDERS HUGE
AND WOULD HAVE SAID BUT THAT THE WORDS TO AID
MY PURPOSE CAME NOT LOOK THOU CLASP ME FIRM
BUT HE WHOSE SUCCOUR THEN NOT FIRST I PROV'D
SOON AS I MOUNTED IN HIS ARMS ALOFT
EMBRACING HELD ME UP AND THUS HE SPAKE
GERYON NOW MOVE THEE BE THY WHEELING GYRES
OF AMPLE CIRCUIT EASY THY DESCENT
THINK ON TH' UNUSUAL BURDEN THOU SUSTAIN'ST
AS A SMALL VESSEL BACK'NING OUT FROM LAND
HER STATION QUITS SO THENCE THE MONSTER LOOS'D
AND WHEN HE FELT HIMSELF AT LARGE TURN'D ROUND
THERE WHERE THE BREAST HAD BEEN HIS FORKED TAIL
THUS LIKE AN EEL OUTSTRETCH'D AT LENGTH HE STEER'D
GATH'RING THE AIR UP WITH RETRACTILE CLAWS
NOT GREATER WAS THE DREAD WHEN PHAETON
THE REINS LET DROP AT RANDOM WHENCE HIGH HEAVEN
WHEREOF SIGNS YET APPEAR WAS WRAPT IN FLAMES
NOR WHEN ILL FATED ICARUS PERCEIV'D
BY LIQUEFACTION OF THE SCALDED WAX
THE TRUSTED PENNONS LOOSEN'D FROM HIS LOINS
HIS SIRE EXCLAIMING LOUD ILL WAY THOU KEEP'ST
THAN WAS MY DREAD WHEN ROUND ME ON EACH PART
THE AIR I VIEW'D AND OTHER OBJECT NONE
SAVE THE FELL BEAST
HE SLOWLY SAILING WHEELS
HIS DOWNWARD MOTION UNOBSERV'D OF ME
BUT THAT THE WIND ARISING TO MY FACE
BREATHES ON ME FROM BELOW
NOW ON OUR RIGHT
I HEARD THE CATARACT BENEATH US LEAP
WITH HIDEOUS CRASH WHENCE BENDING DOWN TO' EXPLORE
NEW TERROR I CONCEIV'D AT THE STEEP PLUNGE
FOR FLAMES I SAW AND WAILINGS SMOTE MINE EAR
SO THAT ALL TREMBLING CLOSE I CROUCH'D MY LIMBS
AND THEN DISTINGUISH'D UNPERCEIV'D BEFORE
BY THE DREAD TORMENTS THAT ON EVERY SIDE
DREW NEARER HOW OUR DOWNWARD COURSE WE WOUND
AS FALCON THAT HATH LONG BEEN ON THE WING
BUT LURE NOR BIRD HATH SEEN WHILE IN DESPAIR
THE FALCONER CRIES AH ME THOU STOOP'ST TO EARTH
WEARIED DESCENDS AND SWIFTLY DOWN THE SKY
IN MANY AN ORBIT WHEELS THEN LIGHTING SITS
AT DISTANCE FROM HIS LORD IN ANGRY MOOD
SO GERYON LIGHTING PLACES US ON FOOT
LOW DOWN AT BASE OF THE DEEP FURROW'D ROCK
AND OF HIS BURDEN THERE DISCHARG'D FORTHWITH
SPRANG FORWARD LIKE AN ARROW FROM THE STRING
CANTO XVIII
THERE IS A PLACE WITHIN THE DEPTHS OF HELL
CALL'D MALEBOLGE ALL OF ROCK DARK STAIN'D
WITH HUE FERRUGINOUS E'EN AS THE STEEP
THAT ROUND IT CIRCLING WINDS
RIGHT IN THE MIDST
OF THAT ABOMINABLE REGION YAWNS
A SPACIOUS GULF PROFOUND WHEREOF THE FRAME
DUE TIME SHALL TELL
THE CIRCLE THAT REMAINS
THROUGHOUT ITS ROUND BETWEEN THE GULF AND BASE
OF THE HIGH CRAGGY BANKS SUCCESSIVE FORMS
TEN TRENCHES IN ITS HOLLOW BOTTOM SUNK
AS WHERE TO GUARD THE WALLS FULL MANY A FOSS
BEGIRDS SOME STATELY CASTLE SURE DEFENCE
AFFORDING TO THE SPACE WITHIN SO HERE
WERE MODEL'D THESE AND AS LIKE FORTRESSES
E'EN FROM THEIR THRESHOLD TO THE BRINK WITHOUT
ARE FLANK'D WITH BRIDGES FROM THE ROCK'S LOW BASE
THUS FLINTY PATHS ADVANC'D THAT 'CROSS THE MOLES
AND DIKES STRUCK ONWARD FAR AS TO THE GULF
THAT IN ONE BOUND COLLECTED CUTS THEM OFF
SUCH WAS THE PLACE WHEREIN WE FOUND OURSELVES
FROM GERYON'S BACK DISLODG'D
THE BARD TO LEFT
HELD ON HIS WAY AND I BEHIND HIM MOV'D
ON OUR RIGHT HAND NEW MISERY I SAW
NEW PAINS NEW EXECUTIONERS OF WRATH
THAT SWARMING PEOPLED THE FIRST CHASM
BELOW
WERE NAKED SINNERS
HITHERWARD THEY CAME
MEETING OUR FACES FROM THE MIDDLE POINT
WITH US BEYOND BUT WITH A LARGER STRIDE
E'EN THUS THE ROMANS WHEN THE YEAR RETURNS
OF JUBILEE WITH BETTER SPEED TO RID
THE THRONGING MULTITUDES THEIR MEANS DEVISE
FOR SUCH AS PASS THE BRIDGE THAT ON ONE SIDE
ALL FRONT TOWARD THE CASTLE AND APPROACH
SAINT PETER'S FANE ON TH' OTHER TOWARDS THE MOUNT
EACH DIVERS WAY ALONG THE GRISLY ROCK
HORN'D DEMONS I BEHELD WITH LASHES HUGE
THAT ON THEIR BACK UNMERCIFULLY SMOTE
AH HOW THEY MADE THEM BOUND AT THE FIRST STRIPE
NONE FOR THE SECOND WAITED NOR THE THIRD
MEANTIME AS ON I PASS'D ONE MET MY SIGHT
WHOM SOON AS VIEW'D OF HIM CRIED I NOT YET
MINE EYE HATH HAD HIS FILL WITH FIXED GAZE
I THEREFORE SCANN'D HIM
STRAIGHT THE TEACHER KIND
PAUS'D WITH ME AND CONSENTED I SHOULD WALK
BACKWARD A SPACE AND THE TORMENTED SPIRIT
WHO THOUGHT TO HIDE HIM BENT HIS VISAGE DOWN
BUT IT AVAIL'D HIM NOUGHT FOR I EXCLAIM'D
THOU WHO DOST CAST THY EYE UPON THE GROUND
UNLESS THY FEATURES DO BELIE THEE MUCH
VENEDICO ART THOU
BUT WHAT BRINGS THEE
INTO THIS BITTER SEAS'NING HE REPLIED
UNWILLINGLY I ANSWER TO THY WORDS
BUT THY CLEAR SPEECH THAT TO MY MIND RECALLS
THE WORLD I ONCE INHABITED CONSTRAINS ME
KNOW THEN 'TWAS I WHO LED FAIR GHISOLA
TO DO THE MARQUIS' WILL HOWEVER FAME
THE SHAMEFUL TALE HAVE BRUITED
NOR ALONE
BOLOGNA HITHER SENDETH ME TO MOURN
RATHER WITH US THE PLACE IS SO O'ERTHRONG'D
THAT NOT SO MANY TONGUES THIS DAY ARE TAUGHT
BETWIXT THE RENO AND SAVENA'S STREAM
TO ANSWER SIPA IN THEIR COUNTRY'S PHRASE
AND IF OF THAT SECURER PROOF THOU NEED
REMEMBER BUT OUR CRAVING THIRST FOR GOLD
HIM SPEAKING THUS A DEMON WITH HIS THONG
STRUCK AND EXCLAIM'D AWAY CORRUPTER HERE
WOMEN ARE NONE FOR SALE FORTHWITH I JOIN'D
MY ESCORT AND FEW PACES THENCE WE CAME
TO WHERE A ROCK FORTH ISSUED FROM THE BANK
THAT EASILY ASCENDED TO THE RIGHT
UPON ITS SPLINTER TURNING WE DEPART
FROM THOSE ETERNAL BARRIERS
WHEN ARRIV'D
WHERE UNDERNEATH THE GAPING ARCH LETS PASS
THE SCOURGED SOULS PAUSE HERE THE TEACHER SAID
AND LET THESE OTHERS MISERABLE NOW
STRIKE ON THY KEN FACES NOT YET BEHELD
FOR THAT TOGETHER THEY WITH US HAVE WALK'D
FROM THE OLD BRIDGE WE EY'D THE PACK WHO CAME
FROM TH' OTHER SIDE TOWARDS US LIKE THE REST
EXCORIATE FROM THE LASH
MY GENTLE GUIDE
BY ME UNQUESTION'D THUS HIS SPEECH RESUM'D
BEHOLD THAT LOFTY SHADE WHO THIS WAY TENDS
AND SEEMS TOO WOE BEGONE TO DROP A TEAR
HOW YET THE REGAL ASPECT HE RETAINS
JASON IS HE WHOSE SKILL AND PROWESS WON
THE RAM FROM COLCHOS
TO THE LEMNIAN ISLE
HIS PASSAGE THITHER LED HIM WHEN THOSE BOLD
AND PITILESS WOMEN HAD SLAIN ALL THEIR MALES
THERE HE WITH TOKENS AND FAIR WITCHING WORDS
HYPSIPYLE BEGUIL'D A VIRGIN YOUNG
WHO FIRST HAD ALL THE REST HERSELF BEGUIL'D
IMPREGNATED HE LEFT HER THERE FORLORN
SUCH IS THE GUILT CONDEMNS HIM TO THIS PAIN
HERE TOO MEDEA'S INJ'RIES ARE AVENGED
ALL BEAR HIM COMPANY WHO LIKE DECEIT
TO HIS HAVE PRACTIS'D
AND THUS MUCH TO KNOW
OF THE FIRST VALE SUFFICE THEE AND OF THOSE
WHOM ITS KEEN TORMENTS URGE NOW HAD WE COME
WHERE CROSSING THE NEXT PIER THE STRAIGHTEN'D PATH
BESTRIDES ITS SHOULDERS TO ANOTHER ARCH
HENCE IN THE SECOND CHASM WE HEARD THE GHOSTS
WHO JIBBER IN LOW MELANCHOLY SOUNDS
WITH WIDE STRETCH'D NOSTRILS SNORT AND ON THEMSELVES
SMITE WITH THEIR PALMS
UPON THE BANKS A SCURF
FROM THE FOUL STEAM CONDENS'D ENCRUSTING HUNG
THAT HELD SHARP COMBAT WITH THE SIGHT AND SMELL
SO HOLLOW IS THE DEPTH THAT FROM NO PART
SAVE ON THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCKY SPAN
COULD I DISTINGUISH AUGHT
THUS FAR WE CAME
AND THENCE I SAW WITHIN THE FOSS BELOW
A CROWD IMMERS'D IN ORDURE THAT APPEAR'D
DRAFF OF THE HUMAN BODY
THERE BENEATH
SEARCHING WITH EYE INQUISITIVE I MARK'D
ONE WITH HIS HEAD SO GRIM'D 'T WERE HARD TO DEEM
IF HE WERE CLERK OR LAYMAN
LOUD HE CRIED
WHY GREEDILY THUS BENDEST MORE ON ME
THAN ON THESE OTHER FILTHY ONES THY KEN
BECAUSE IF TRUE MY MEM'RY I REPLIED
I HERETOFORE HAVE SEEN THEE WITH DRY LOCKS
AND THOU ALESSIO ART OF LUCCA SPRUNG
THEREFORE THAN ALL THE REST I SCAN THEE MORE
THEN BEATING ON HIS BRAIN THESE WORDS HE SPAKE
ME THUS LOW DOWN MY FLATTERIES HAVE SUNK
WHEREWITH I NE'ER ENOUGH COULD GLUT MY TONGUE
MY LEADER THUS A LITTLE FURTHER STRETCH
THY FACE THAT THOU THE VISAGE WELL MAYST NOTE
OF THAT BESOTTED SLUTTISH COURTEZAN
WHO THERE DOTH REND HER WITH DEFILED NAILS
NOW CROUCHING DOWN NOW RISEN ON HER FEET
THAIS IS THIS THE HARLOT WHOSE FALSE LIP
ANSWER'D HER DOTING PARAMOUR THAT ASK'D
'THANKEST ME MUCH 'SAY RATHER WONDROUSLY
AND SEEING THIS HERE SATIATE BE OUR VIEW
CANTO XIX
WOE TO THEE SIMON MAGUS WOE TO YOU
HIS WRETCHED FOLLOWERS WHO THE THINGS OF GOD
WHICH SHOULD BE WEDDED UNTO GOODNESS THEM
RAPACIOUS AS YE ARE DO PROSTITUTE
FOR GOLD AND SILVER IN ADULTERY
NOW MUST THE TRUMPET SOUND FOR YOU SINCE YOURS
IS THE THIRD CHASM
UPON THE FOLLOWING VAULT
WE NOW HAD MOUNTED WHERE THE ROCK IMPENDS
DIRECTLY O'ER THE CENTRE OF THE FOSS
WISDOM SUPREME HOW WONDERFUL THE ART
WHICH THOU DOST MANIFEST IN HEAVEN IN EARTH
AND IN THE EVIL WORLD HOW JUST A MEED
ALLOTTING BY THY VIRTUE UNTO ALL
I SAW THE LIVID STONE THROUGHOUT THE SIDES
AND IN ITS BOTTOM FULL OF APERTURES
ALL EQUAL IN THEIR WIDTH AND CIRCULAR EACH
NOR AMPLE LESS NOR LARGER THEY APPEAR'D
THAN IN SAINT JOHN'S FAIR DOME OF ME BELOV'D
THOSE FRAM'D TO HOLD THE PURE BAPTISMAL STREAMS
ONE OF THE WHICH I BRAKE SOME FEW YEARS PAST
TO SAVE A WHELMING INFANT AND BE THIS
A SEAL TO UNDECEIVE WHOEVER DOUBTS
THE MOTIVE OF MY DEED
FROM OUT THE MOUTH
OF EVERY ONE EMERG'D A SINNER'S FEET
AND OF THE LEGS HIGH UPWARD AS THE CALF
THE REST BENEATH WAS HID
ON EITHER FOOT
THE SOLES WERE BURNING WHENCE THE FLEXILE JOINTS
GLANC'D WITH SUCH VIOLENT MOTION AS HAD SNAPT
ASUNDER CORDS OR TWISTED WITHS
AS FLAME
FEEDING ON UNCTUOUS MATTER GLIDES ALONG
THE SURFACE SCARCELY TOUCHING WHERE IT MOVES
SO HERE FROM HEEL TO POINT GLIDED THE FLAMES
MASTER SAY WHO IS HE THAN ALL THE REST
GLANCING IN FIERCER AGONY ON WHOM
A RUDDIER FLAME DOTH PREY I THUS INQUIR'D
IF THOU BE WILLING HE REPLIED THAT I
CARRY THEE DOWN WHERE LEAST THE SLOPE BANK FALLS
HE OF HIMSELF SHALL TELL THEE AND HIS WRONGS
I THEN AS PLEASES THEE TO ME IS BEST
THOU ART MY LORD AND KNOW'ST THAT NE'ER I QUIT
THY WILL WHAT SILENCE HIDES THAT KNOWEST THOU
THEREAT ON THE FOURTH PIER WE CAME WE TURN'D
AND ON OUR LEFT DESCENDED TO THE DEPTH
A NARROW STRAIT AND PERFORATED CLOSE
NOR FROM HIS SIDE MY LEADER SET ME DOWN
TILL TO HIS ORIFICE HE BROUGHT WHOSE LIMB
QUIV'RING EXPRESS'D HIS PANG
WHOE'ER THOU ART
SAD SPIRIT THUS REVERS'D AND AS A STAKE
DRIV'N IN THE SOIL I IN THESE WORDS BEGAN
IF THOU BE ABLE UTTER FORTH THY VOICE
THERE STOOD I LIKE THE FRIAR THAT DOTH SHRIVE
A WRETCH FOR MURDER DOOM'D WHO E'EN WHEN FIX'D
CALLETH HIM BACK WHENCE DEATH AWHILE DELAYS
HE SHOUTED HA ALREADY STANDEST THERE
ALREADY STANDEST THERE O BONIFACE
BY MANY A YEAR THE WRITING PLAY'D ME FALSE
SO EARLY DOST THOU SURFEIT WITH THE WEALTH
FOR WHICH THOU FEAREDST NOT IN GUILE TO TAKE
THE LOVELY LADY AND THEN MANGLE HER
I FELT AS THOSE WHO PIERCING NOT THE DRIFT
OF ANSWER MADE THEM STAND AS IF EXPOS'D
IN MOCKERY NOR KNOW WHAT TO REPLY
WHEN VIRGIL THUS ADMONISH'D TELL HIM QUICK
I AM NOT HE NOT HE WHOM THOU BELIEV'ST
AND I AS WAS ENJOIN'D ME STRAIGHT REPLIED
THAT HEARD THE SPIRIT ALL DID WRENCH HIS FEET
AND SIGHING NEXT IN WOEFUL ACCENT SPAKE
WHAT THEN OF ME REQUIREST IF TO KNOW
SO MUCH IMPORTS THEE WHO I AM THAT THOU
HAST THEREFORE DOWN THE BANK DESCENDED LEARN
THAT IN THE MIGHTY MANTLE I WAS ROB'D
AND OF A SHE BEAR WAS INDEED THE SON
SO EAGER TO ADVANCE MY WHELPS THAT THERE
MY HAVING IN MY PURSE ABOVE I STOW'D
AND HERE MYSELF
UNDER MY HEAD ARE DRAGG'D
THE REST MY PREDECESSORS IN THE GUILT
OF SIMONY
STRETCH'D AT THEIR LENGTH THEY LIE
ALONG AN OPENING IN THE ROCK
'MIDST THEM
I ALSO LOW SHALL FALL SOON AS HE COMES
FOR WHOM I TOOK THEE WHEN SO HASTILY
I QUESTION'D
BUT ALREADY LONGER TIME
HATH PASS'D SINCE MY SOULS KINDLED AND I THUS
UPTURN'D HAVE STOOD THAN IS HIS DOOM TO STAND
PLANTED WITH FIERY FEET
FOR AFTER HIM
ONE YET OF DEEDS MORE UGLY SHALL ARRIVE
FROM FORTH THE WEST A SHEPHERD WITHOUT LAW
FATED TO COVER BOTH HIS FORM AND MINE
HE A NEW JASON SHALL BE CALL'D OF WHOM
IN MACCABEES WE READ AND FAVOUR SUCH
AS TO THAT PRIEST HIS KING INDULGENT SHOW'D
SHALL BE OF FRANCE'S MONARCH SHOWN TO HIM
I KNOW NOT IF I HERE TOO FAR PRESUM'D
BUT IN THIS STRAIN I ANSWER'D TELL ME NOW
WHAT TREASURES FROM ST
PETER AT THE FIRST
OUR LORD DEMANDED WHEN HE PUT THE KEYS
INTO HIS CHARGE SURELY HE ASK'D NO MORE
BUT FOLLOW ME NOR PETER NOR THE REST
OR GOLD OR SILVER OF MATTHIAS TOOK
WHEN LOTS WERE CAST UPON THE FORFEIT PLACE
OF THE CONDEMNED SOUL
ABIDE THOU THEN
THY PUNISHMENT OF RIGHT IS MERITED
AND LOOK THOU WELL TO THAT ILL GOTTEN COIN
WHICH AGAINST CHARLES THY HARDIHOOD INSPIR'D
IF REVERENCE OF THE KEYS RESTRAIN'D ME NOT
WHICH THOU IN HAPPIER TIME DIDST HOLD I YET
SEVERER SPEECH MIGHT USE
YOUR AVARICE
O'ERCASTS THE WORLD WITH MOURNING UNDER FOOT
TREADING THE GOOD AND RAISING BAD MEN UP
OF SHEPHERDS LIKE TO YOU TH' EVANGELIST
WAS WARE WHEN HER WHO SITS UPON THE WAVES
WITH KINGS IN FILTHY WHOREDOM HE BEHELD
SHE WHO WITH SEVEN HEADS TOWER'D AT HER BIRTH
AND FROM TEN HORNS HER PROOF OF GLORY DREW
LONG AS HER SPOUSE IN VIRTUE TOOK DELIGHT
OF GOLD AND SILVER YE HAVE MADE YOUR GOD
DIFF'RING WHEREIN FROM THE IDOLATER
BUT HE THAT WORSHIPS ONE A HUNDRED YE
AH CONSTANTINE TO HOW MUCH ILL GAVE BIRTH
NOT THY CONVERSION BUT THAT PLENTEOUS DOWER
WHICH THE FIRST WEALTHY FATHER GAIN'D FROM THEE
MEANWHILE AS THUS I SUNG HE WHETHER WRATH
OR CONSCIENCE SMOTE HIM VIOLENT UPSPRANG
SPINNING ON EITHER SOLE
I DO BELIEVE
MY TEACHER WELL WAS PLEAS'D WITH SO COMPOS'D
A LIP HE LISTEN'D EVER TO THE SOUND
OF THE TRUE WORDS I UTTER'D
IN BOTH ARMS
HE CAUGHT AND TO HIS BOSOM LIFTING ME
UPWARD RETRAC'D THE WAY OF HIS DESCENT
NOR WEARY OF HIS WEIGHT HE PRESS'D ME CLOSE
TILL TO THE SUMMIT OF THE ROCK WE CAME
OUR PASSAGE FROM THE FOURTH TO THE FIFTH PIER
HIS CHERISH'D BURDEN THERE GENTLY HE PLAC'D
UPON THE RUGGED ROCK AND STEEP A PATH
NOT EASY FOR THE CLAMB'RING GOAT TO MOUNT
THENCE TO MY VIEW ANOTHER VALE APPEAR'D
CANTO XX
AND NOW THE VERSE PROCEEDS TO TORMENTS NEW
FIT ARGUMENT OF THIS THE TWENTIETH STRAIN
OF THE FIRST SONG WHOSE AWFUL THEME RECORDS
THE SPIRITS WHELM'D IN WOE
EARNEST I LOOK'D
INTO THE DEPTH THAT OPEN'D TO MY VIEW
MOISTEN'D WITH TEARS OF ANGUISH AND BEHELD
A TRIBE THAT CAME ALONG THE HOLLOW VALE
IN SILENCE WEEPING SUCH THEIR STEP AS WALK
QUIRES CHANTING SOLEMN LITANIES ON EARTH
AS ON THEM MORE DIRECT MINE EYE DESCENDS
EACH WONDROUSLY SEEM'D TO BE REVERS'D
AT THE NECK BONE SO THAT THE COUNTENANCE
WAS FROM THE REINS AVERTED AND BECAUSE
NONE MIGHT BEFORE HIM LOOK THEY WERE COMPELL'D
TO' ADVANCE WITH BACKWARD GAIT
THUS ONE PERHAPS
HATH BEEN BY FORCE OF PALSY CLEAN TRANSPOS'D
BUT I NE'ER SAW IT NOR BELIEVE IT SO
NOW READER THINK WITHIN THYSELF SO GOD
FRUIT OF THY READING GIVE THEE HOW I LONG
COULD KEEP MY VISAGE DRY WHEN I BEHELD
NEAR ME OUR FORM DISTORTED IN SUCH GUISE
THAT ON THE HINDER PARTS FALL'N FROM THE FACE
THE TEARS DOWN STREAMING ROLL'D
AGAINST A ROCK
I LEANT AND WEPT SO THAT MY GUIDE EXCLAIM'D
WHAT AND ART THOU TOO WITLESS AS THE REST
HERE PITY MOST DOTH SHOW HERSELF ALIVE
WHEN SHE IS DEAD
WHAT GUILT EXCEEDETH HIS
WHO WITH HEAVEN'S JUDGMENT IN HIS PASSION STRIVES
RAISE UP THY HEAD RAISE UP AND SEE THE MAN
BEFORE WHOSE EYES EARTH GAP'D IN THEBES WHEN ALL
CRIED OUT 'AMPHIARAUS WHITHER RUSHEST
'WHY LEAVEST THOU THE WAR HE NOT THE LESS
FELL RUINING FAR AS TO MINOS DOWN
WHOSE GRAPPLE NONE ELUDES
LO HOW HE MAKES
THE BREAST HIS SHOULDERS AND WHO ONCE TOO FAR
BEFORE HIM WISH'D TO SEE NOW BACKWARD LOOKS
AND TREADS REVERSE HIS PATH
TIRESIAS NOTE
WHO SEMBLANCE CHANG'D WHEN WOMAN HE BECAME
OF MALE THROUGH EVERY LIMB TRANSFORM'D AND THEN
ONCE MORE BEHOV'D HIM WITH HIS ROD TO STRIKE
THE TWO ENTWINING SERPENTS ERE THE PLUMES

GNARL ON 'T IS BUT IN TOKEN OF THEIR SPITE
AGAINST THE SOULS WHO MOURN IN TORMENT STEEP'D
TO LEFTWARD O'ER THE PIER THEY TURN'D BUT EACH
HAD FIRST BETWEEN HIS TEETH PREST CLOSE THE TONGUE
TOWARD THEIR LEADER FOR A SIGNAL LOOKING
WHICH HE WITH SOUND OBSCENE TRIUMPHANT GAVE
CANTO XXII
IT HATH BEEN HERETOFORE MY CHANCE TO SEE
HORSEMEN WITH MARTIAL ORDER SHIFTING CAMP
TO ONSET SALLYING OR IN MUSTER RANG'D
OR IN RETREAT SOMETIMES OUTSTRETCH'D FOR FLIGHT
LIGHT ARMED SQUADRONS AND FLEET FORAGERS
SCOURING THY PLAINS AREZZO HAVE I SEEN
AND CLASHING TOURNAMENTS AND TILTING JOUSTS
NOW WITH THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS NOW OF BELLS
TABORS OR SIGNALS MADE FROM CASTLED HEIGHTS
AND WITH INVENTIONS MULTIFORM OUR OWN
OR INTRODUC'D FROM FOREIGN LAND BUT NE'ER
TO SUCH A STRANGE RECORDER I BEHELD
IN EVOLUTION MOVING HORSE NOR FOOT
NOR SHIP THAT TACK'D BY SIGN FROM LAND OR STAR
WITH THE TEN DEMONS ON OUR WAY WE WENT
AH FEARFUL COMPANY BUT IN THE CHURCH
WITH SAINTS WITH GLUTTONS AT THE TAVERN'S MESS
STILL EARNEST ON THE PITCH I GAZ'D TO MARK
ALL THINGS WHATE'ER THE CHASM CONTAIN'D AND THOSE
WHO BURN'D WITHIN
AS DOLPHINS THAT IN SIGN
TO MARINERS HEAVE HIGH THEIR ARCHED BACKS
THAT THENCE FOREWARN'D THEY MAY ADVISE TO SAVE
THEIR THREATEN'D VESSELS SO AT INTERVALS
TO EASE THE PAIN HIS BACK SOME SINNER SHOW'D
THEN HID MORE NIMBLY THAN THE LIGHTNING GLANCE
E'EN AS THE FROGS THAT OF A WAT'RY MOAT
STAND AT THE BRINK WITH THE JAWS ONLY OUT
THEIR FEET AND OF THE TRUNK ALL ELSE CONCEALED
THUS ON EACH PART THE SINNERS STOOD BUT SOON
AS BARBARICCIA WAS AT HAND SO THEY
DREW BACK UNDER THE WAVE
I SAW AND YET
MY HEART DOTH STAGGER ONE THAT WAITED THUS
AS IT BEFALLS THAT OFT ONE FROG REMAINS
WHILE THE NEXT SPRINGS AWAY AND GRAFFIACAN
WHO OF THE FIENDS WAS NEAREST GRAPPLING SEIZ'D
HIS CLOTTED LOCKS AND DRAGG'D HIM SPRAWLING UP
THAT HE APPEAR'D TO ME AN OTTER
EACH
ALREADY BY THEIR NAMES I KNEW SO WELL
WHEN THEY WERE CHOSEN I OBSERV'D AND MARK'D
HOW ONE THE OTHER CALL'D
O RUBICANT
SEE THAT HIS HIDE THOU WITH THY TALONS FLAY
SHOUTED TOGETHER ALL THE CURSED CREW
THEN I INFORM THEE MASTER IF THOU MAY
WHAT WRETCHED SOUL IS THIS ON WHOM THEIR HAND
HIS FOES HAVE LAID MY LEADER TO HIS SIDE
APPROACH'D AND WHENCE HE CAME INQUIR'D TO WHOM
WAS ANSWER'D THUS BORN IN NAVARRE'S DOMAIN
MY MOTHER PLAC'D ME IN A LORD'S RETINUE
FOR SHE HAD BORNE ME TO A LOSEL VILE
A SPENDTHRIFT OF HIS SUBSTANCE AND HIMSELF
THE GOOD KING THIBAULT AFTER THAT I SERV'D
TO PECULATING HERE MY THOUGHTS WERE TURN'D
WHEREOF I GIVE ACCOUNT IN THIS DIRE HEAT
STRAIGHT CIRIATTO FROM WHOSE MOUTH A TUSK
ISSUED ON EITHER SIDE AS FROM A BOAR
RIPT HIM WITH ONE OF THESE
'TWIXT EVIL CLAWS
THE MOUSE HAD FALL'N BUT BARBARICCIA CRIED
SEIZING HIM WITH BOTH ARMS STAND THOU APART
WHILE I DO FIX HIM ON MY PRONG TRANSPIERC'D
THEN ADDED TURNING TO MY GUIDE HIS FACE
INQUIRE OF HIM IF MORE THOU WISH TO LEARN
ERE HE AGAIN BE RENT MY LEADER THUS
THEN TELL US OF THE PARTNERS IN THY GUILT
KNOWEST THOU ANY SPRUNG OF LATIAN LAND
UNDER THE TAR I PARTED HE REPLIED
BUT NOW FROM ONE WHO SOJOURN'D NOT FAR THENCE
SO WERE I UNDER SHELTER NOW WITH HIM
NOR HOOK NOR TALON THEN SHOULD SCARE ME MORE
TOO LONG WE SUFFER LIBICOCCO CRIED
THEN DARTING FORTH A PRONG SEIZ'D ON HIS ARM
AND MANGLED BORE AWAY THE SINEWY PART
HIM DRAGHINAZZO BY HIS THIGHS BENEATH
WOULD NEXT HAVE CAUGHT WHENCE ANGRILY THEIR CHIEF
TURNING ON ALL SIDES ROUND WITH THREAT'NING BROW
RESTRAIN'D THEM
WHEN THEIR STRIFE A LITTLE CEAS'D
OF HIM WHO YET WAS GAZING ON HIS WOUND
MY TEACHER THUS WITHOUT DELAY INQUIR'D
WHO WAS THE SPIRIT FROM WHOM BY EVIL HAP
PARTING AS THOU HAS TOLD THOU CAM'ST TO SHORE
IT WAS THE FRIAR GOMITA HE REJOIN'D
HE OF GALLURA VESSEL OF ALL GUILE
WHO HAD HIS MASTER'S ENEMIES IN HAND
AND US'D THEM SO THAT THEY COMMEND HIM WELL
MONEY HE TOOK AND THEM AT LARGE DISMISS'D
SO HE REPORTS AND IN EACH OTHER CHARGE
COMMITTED TO HIS KEEPING PLAY'D THE PART
OF BARTERER TO THE HEIGHT WITH HIM DOTH HERD
THE CHIEF OF LOGODORO MICHEL ZANCHE
SARDINIA IS A THEME WHEREOF THEIR TONGUE
IS NEVER WEARY
OUT ALAS BEHOLD
THAT OTHER HOW HE GRINS MORE WOULD I SAY
BUT TREMBLE LEST HE MEAN TO MAUL ME SORE
THEIR CAPTAIN THEN TO FARFARELLO TURNING
WHO ROLL'D HIS MOONY EYES IN ACT TO STRIKE
REBUK'D HIM THUS OFF CURSED BIRD AVAUNT
IF YE DESIRE TO SEE OR HEAR HE THUS
QUAKING WITH DREAD RESUM'D OR TUSCAN SPIRITS
OR LOMBARD I WILL CAUSE THEM TO APPEAR
MEANTIME LET THESE ILL TALONS BATE THEIR FURY
SO THAT NO VENGEANCE THEY MAY FEAR FROM THEM
AND I REMAINING IN THIS SELF SAME PLACE
WILL FOR MYSELF BUT ONE MAKE SEV'N APPEAR
WHEN MY SHRILL WHISTLE SHALL BE HEARD FOR SO
OUR CUSTOM IS TO CALL EACH OTHER UP
CAGNAZZO AT THAT WORD DERIDING GRINN'D
THEN WAGG'D THE HEAD AND SPAKE HEAR HIS DEVICE
MISCHIEVOUS AS HE IS TO PLUNGE HIM DOWN
WHERETO HE THUS WHO FAIL'D NOT IN RICH STORE
OF NICE WOVE TOILS MISCHIEF FORSOOTH EXTREME
MEANT ONLY TO PROCURE MYSELF MORE WOE
NO LONGER ALICHINO THEN REFRAIN'D
BUT THUS THE REST GAINSAYING HIM BESPAKE
IF THOU DO CAST THEE DOWN I NOT ON FOOT
WILL CHASE THEE BUT ABOVE THE PITCH WILL BEAT
MY PLUMES
QUIT WE THE VANTAGE GROUND AND LET
THE BANK BE AS A SHIELD THAT WE MAY SEE
IF SINGLY THOU PREVAIL AGAINST US ALL
NOW READER OF NEW SPORT EXPECT TO HEAR
THEY EACH ONE TURN'D HIS EYES TO THE' OTHER SHORE
HE FIRST WHO WAS THE HARDEST TO PERSUADE
THE SPIRIT OF NAVARRE CHOSE WELL HIS TIME
PLANTED HIS FEET ON LAND AND AT ONE LEAP
ESCAPING DISAPPOINTED THEIR RESOLVE
THEM QUICK RESENTMENT STUNG BUT HIM THE MOST
WHO WAS THE CAUSE OF FAILURE IN PURSUIT
HE THEREFORE SPED EXCLAIMING THOU ART CAUGHT
BUT LITTLE IT AVAIL'D TERROR OUTSTRIPP'D
HIS FOLLOWING FLIGHT THE OTHER PLUNG'D BENEATH
AND HE WITH UPWARD PINION RAIS'D HIS BREAST
E'EN THUS THE WATER FOWL WHEN SHE PERCEIVES
THE FALCON NEAR DIVES INSTANT DOWN WHILE HE
ENRAG'D AND SPENT RETIRES
THAT MOCKERY
IN CALCABRINA FURY STIRR'D WHO FLEW
AFTER HIM WITH DESIRE OF STRIFE INFLAM'D
AND FOR THE BARTERER HAD 'SCAP'D SO TURN'D
HIS TALONS ON HIS COMRADE
O'ER THE DYKE
IN GRAPPLE CLOSE THEY JOIN'D BUT THE' OTHER PROV'D
A GOSHAWK ABLE TO REND WELL HIS FOE
AND IN THE BOILING LAKE BOTH FELL
THE HEAT
WAS UMPIRE SOON BETWEEN THEM BUT IN VAIN
TO LIFT THEMSELVES THEY STROVE SO FAST WERE GLUED
THEIR PENNONS
BARBARICCIA AS THE REST
THAT CHANCE LAMENTING FOUR IN FLIGHT DISPATCH'D
FROM THE' OTHER COAST WITH ALL THEIR WEAPONS ARM'D
THEY TO THEIR POST ON EACH SIDE SPEEDILY
DESCENDING STRETCH'D THEIR HOOKS TOWARD THE FIENDS
WHO FLOUNDER'D INLY BURNING FROM THEIR SCARS
AND WE DEPARTING LEFT THEM TO THAT BROIL
CANTO XXIII
IN SILENCE AND IN SOLITUDE WE WENT
ONE FIRST THE OTHER FOLLOWING HIS STEPS
AS MINOR FRIARS JOURNEYING ON THEIR ROAD
THE PRESENT FRAY HAD TURN'D MY THOUGHTS TO MUSE
UPON OLD AESOP'S FABLE WHERE HE TOLD
WHAT FATE UNTO THE MOUSE AND FROG BEFELL
FOR LANGUAGE HATH NOT SOUNDS MORE LIKE IN SENSE
THAN ARE THESE CHANCES IF THE ORIGIN
AND END OF EACH BE HEEDFULLY COMPAR'D
AND AS ONE THOUGHT BURSTS FROM ANOTHER FORTH
SO AFTERWARD FROM THAT ANOTHER SPRANG
WHICH ADDED DOUBLY TO MY FORMER FEAR
FOR THUS I REASON'D THESE THROUGH US HAVE BEEN
SO FOIL'D WITH LOSS AND MOCK'RY SO COMPLETE
AS NEEDS MUST STING THEM SORE
IF ANGER THEN
BE TO THEIR EVIL WILL CONJOIN'D MORE FELL
THEY SHALL PURSUE US THAN THE SAVAGE HOUND
SNATCHES THE LEVERET PANTING 'TWIXT HIS JAWS
ALREADY I PERCEIV'D MY HAIR STAND ALL
ON END WITH TERROR AND LOOK'D EAGER BACK
TEACHER I THUS BEGAN IF SPEEDILY
THYSELF AND ME THOU HIDE NOT MUCH I DREAD
THOSE EVIL TALONS
EVEN NOW BEHIND
THEY URGE US QUICK IMAGINATION WORKS
SO FORCIBLY THAT I ALREADY FEEL THEM
HE ANSWER'D WERE I FORM'D OF LEADED GLASS
I SHOULD NOT SOONER DRAW UNTO MYSELF
THY OUTWARD IMAGE THAN I NOW IMPRINT
THAT FROM WITHIN
THIS MOMENT CAME THY THOUGHTS
PRESENTED BEFORE MINE WITH SIMILAR ACT
AND COUNT'NANCE SIMILAR SO THAT FROM BOTH
I ONE DESIGN HAVE FRAM'D
IF THE RIGHT COAST
INCLINE SO MUCH THAT WE MAY THENCE DESCEND
INTO THE OTHER CHASM WE SHALL ESCAPE
SECURE FROM THIS IMAGINED PURSUIT
HE HAD NOT SPOKE HIS PURPOSE TO THE END
WHEN I FROM FAR BEHELD THEM WITH SPREAD WINGS
APPROACH TO TAKE US
SUDDENLY MY GUIDE
CAUGHT ME EV'N AS A MOTHER THAT FROM SLEEP
IS BY THE NOISE AROUS'D AND NEAR HER SEES
THE CLIMBING FIRES WHO SNATCHES UP HER BABE
AND FLIES NE'ER PAUSING CAREFUL MORE OF HIM
THAN OF HERSELF THAT BUT A SINGLE VEST
CLINGS ROUND HER LIMBS
DOWN FROM THE JUTTING BEACH
SUPINE HE CAST HIM TO THAT PENDENT ROCK
WHICH CLOSES ON ONE PART THE OTHER CHASM
NEVER RAN WATER WITH SUCH HURRYING PACE
ADOWN THE TUBE TO TURN A LANDMILL'S WHEEL
WHEN NEAREST IT APPROACHES TO THE SPOKES
AS THEN ALONG THAT EDGE MY MASTER RAN
CARRYING ME IN HIS BOSOM AS A CHILD
NOT A COMPANION
SCARCELY HAD HIS FEET
REACH'D TO THE LOWEST OF THE BED BENEATH
WHEN OVER US THE STEEP THEY REACH'D BUT FEAR
IN HIM WAS NONE FOR THAT HIGH PROVIDENCE
WHICH PLAC'D THEM MINISTERS OF THE FIFTH FOSS
POWER OF DEPARTING THENCE TOOK FROM THEM ALL
THERE IN THE DEPTH WE SAW A PAINTED TRIBE
WHO PAC'D WITH TARDY STEPS AROUND AND WEPT
FAINT IN APPEARANCE AND O'ERCOME WITH TOIL
CAPS HAD THEY ON WITH HOODS THAT FELL LOW DOWN
BEFORE THEIR EYES IN FASHION LIKE TO THOSE
WORN BY THE MONKS IN COLOGNE
THEIR OUTSIDE
WAS OVERLAID WITH GOLD DAZZLING TO VIEW
BUT LEADEN ALL WITHIN AND OF SUCH WEIGHT
THAT FREDERICK'S COMPAR'D TO THESE WERE STRAW
OH EVERLASTING WEARISOME ATTIRE
WE YET ONCE MORE WITH THEM TOGETHER TURN'D
TO LEFTWARD ON THEIR DISMAL MOAN INTENT
BUT BY THE WEIGHT OPPRESS'D SO SLOWLY CAME
THE FAINTING PEOPLE THAT OUR COMPANY
WAS CHANG'D AT EVERY MOVEMENT OF THE STEP
WHENCE I MY GUIDE ADDRESS'D SEE THAT THOU FIND
SOME SPIRIT WHOSE NAME MAY BY HIS DEEDS BE KNOWN
AND TO THAT END LOOK ROUND THEE AS THOU GO'ST
THEN ONE WHO UNDERSTOOD THE TUSCAN VOICE
CRIED AFTER US ALOUD HOLD IN YOUR FEET
YE WHO SO SWIFTLY SPEED THROUGH THE DUSK AIR
PERCHANCE FROM ME THOU SHALT OBTAIN THY WISH
WHEREAT MY LEADER TURNING ME BESPAKE
PAUSE AND THEN ONWARD AT THEIR PACE PROCEED
I STAID AND SAW TWO SPIRITS IN WHOSE LOOK
IMPATIENT EAGERNESS OF MIND WAS MARK'D
TO OVERTAKE ME BUT THE LOAD THEY BARE
AND NARROW PATH RETARDED THEIR APPROACH
SOON AS ARRIV'D THEY WITH AN EYE ASKANCE
PERUS'D ME BUT SPAKE NOT THEN TURNING EACH
TO OTHER THUS CONFERRING SAID THIS ONE
SEEMS BY THE ACTION OF HIS THROAT ALIVE
AND BE THEY DEAD WHAT PRIVILEGE ALLOWS
THEY WALK UNMANTLED BY THE CUMBROUS STOLE
THEN THUS TO ME TUSCAN WHO VISITEST
THE COLLEGE OF THE MOURNING HYPOCRITES
DISDAIN NOT TO INSTRUCT US WHO THOU ART
BY ARNO'S PLEASANT STREAM I THUS REPLIED
IN THE GREAT CITY I WAS BRED AND GREW
AND WEAR THE BODY I HAVE EVER WORN
BUT WHO ARE YE FROM WHOM SUCH MIGHTY GRIEF
AS NOW I WITNESS COURSETH DOWN YOUR CHEEKS
WHAT TORMENT BREAKS FORTH IN THIS BITTER WOE
OUR BONNETS GLEAMING BRIGHT WITH ORANGE HUE
ONE OF THEM ANSWER'D ARE SO LEADEN GROSS
THAT WITH THEIR WEIGHT THEY MAKE THE BALANCES
TO CRACK BENEATH THEM
JOYOUS FRIARS WE WERE
BOLOGNA'S NATIVES CATALANO I
HE LODERINGO NAM'D AND BY THY LAND
TOGETHER TAKEN AS MEN USED TO TAKE
A SINGLE AND INDIFFERENT ARBITER
TO RECONCILE THEIR STRIFES
HOW THERE WE SPED
GARDINGO'S VICINAGE CAN BEST DECLARE
O FRIARS I BEGAN YOUR MISERIES
BUT THERE BRAKE OFF FOR ONE HAD CAUGHT MY EYE
FIX'D TO A CROSS WITH THREE STAKES ON THE GROUND
HE WHEN HE SAW ME WRITH'D HIMSELF THROUGHOUT
DISTORTED RUFFLING WITH DEEP SIGHS HIS BEARD
AND CATALANO WHO THEREOF WAS 'WARE
THUS SPAKE THAT PIERCED SPIRIT WHOM INTENT
THOU VIEW'ST WAS HE WHO GAVE THE PHARISEES
COUNSEL THAT IT WERE FITTING FOR ONE MAN
TO SUFFER FOR THE PEOPLE
HE DOTH LIE
TRANSVERSE NOR ANY PASSES BUT HIM FIRST
BEHOVES MAKE FEELING TRIAL HOW EACH WEIGHS
IN STRAITS LIKE THIS ALONG THE FOSS ARE PLAC'D
THE FATHER OF HIS CONSORT AND THE REST
PARTAKERS IN THAT COUNCIL SEED OF ILL
AND SORROW TO THE JEWS I NOTED THEN
HOW VIRGIL GAZ'D WITH WONDER UPON HIM
THUS ABJECTLY EXTENDED ON THE CROSS
IN BANISHMENT ETERNAL
TO THE FRIAR
HE NEXT HIS WORDS ADDRESS'D WE PRAY YE TELL
IF SO BE LAWFUL WHETHER ON OUR RIGHT
LIES ANY OPENING IN THE ROCK WHEREBY
WE BOTH MAY ISSUE HENCE WITHOUT CONSTRAINT
ON THE DARK ANGELS THAT COMPELL'D THEY COME
TO LEAD US FROM THIS DEPTH HE THUS REPLIED
NEARER THAN THOU DOST HOPE THERE IS A ROCK
FROM THE NEXT CIRCLE MOVING WHICH O'ERSTEPS
EACH VALE OF HORROR SAVE THAT HERE HIS COPE
IS SHATTER'D
BY THE RUIN YE MAY MOUNT
FOR ON THE SIDE IT SLANTS AND MOST THE HEIGHT
RISES BELOW WITH HEAD BENT DOWN AWHILE
MY LEADER STOOD THEN SPAKE HE WARN'D US ILL
WHO YONDER HANGS THE SINNERS ON HIS HOOK
TO WHOM THE FRIAR AT BOLOGNA ERST
I MANY VICES OF THE DEVIL HEARD
AMONG THE REST WAS SAID 'HE IS A LIAR
AND THE FATHER OF LIES WHEN HE HAD SPOKE
MY LEADER WITH LARGE STRIDES PROCEEDED ON
SOMEWHAT DISTURB'D WITH ANGER IN HIS LOOK
I THEREFORE LEFT THE SPIRITS HEAVY LADEN
AND FOLLOWING HIS BELOVED FOOTSTEPS MARK'D
CANTO XXIV
IN THE YEAR'S EARLY NONAGE WHEN THE SUN
TEMPERS HIS TRESSES IN AQUARIUS' URN
AND NOW TOWARDS EQUAL DAY THE NIGHTS RECEDE
WHEN AS THE RIME UPON THE EARTH PUTS ON
HER DAZZLING SISTER'S IMAGE BUT NOT LONG
HER MILDER SWAY ENDURES THEN RISETH UP
THE VILLAGE HIND WHOM FAILS HIS WINTRY STORE
AND LOOKING OUT BEHOLDS THE PLAIN AROUND
ALL WHITEN'D WHENCE IMPATIENTLY HE SMITES
HIS THIGHS AND TO HIS HUT RETURNING IN
THERE PACES TO AND FRO WAILING HIS LOT
AS A DISCOMFITED AND HELPLESS MAN
THEN COMES HE FORTH AGAIN AND FEELS NEW HOPE
SPRING IN HIS BOSOM FINDING E'EN THUS SOON
THE WORLD HATH CHANG'D ITS COUNT'NANCE GRASPS HIS CROOK
AND FORTH TO PASTURE DRIVES HIS LITTLE FLOCK
SO ME MY GUIDE DISHEARTEN'D WHEN I SAW
HIS TROUBLED FOREHEAD AND SO SPEEDILY
THAT ILL WAS CUR'D FOR AT THE FALLEN BRIDGE
ARRIVING TOWARDS ME WITH A LOOK AS SWEET
HE TURN'D HIM BACK AS THAT I FIRST BEHELD
AT THE STEEP MOUNTAIN'S FOOT
REGARDING WELL
THE RUIN AND SOME COUNSEL FIRST MAINTAIN'D
WITH HIS OWN THOUGHT HE OPEN'D WIDE HIS ARM
AND TOOK ME UP
AS ONE WHO WHILE HE WORKS
COMPUTES HIS LABOUR'S ISSUE THAT HE SEEMS
STILL TO FORESEE THE' EFFECT SO LIFTING ME
UP TO THE SUMMIT OF ONE PEAK HE FIX'D
HIS EYE UPON ANOTHER
GRAPPLE THAT
SAID HE BUT FIRST MAKE PROOF IF IT BE SUCH
AS WILL SUSTAIN THEE FOR ONE CAPP'D WITH LEAD
THIS WERE NO JOURNEY
SCARCELY HE THOUGH LIGHT
AND I THOUGH ONWARD PUSH'D FROM CRAG TO CRAG
COULD MOUNT
AND IF THE PRECINCT OF THIS COAST
WERE NOT LESS AMPLE THAN THE LAST FOR HIM
I KNOW NOT BUT MY STRENGTH HAD SURELY FAIL'D
BUT MALEBOLGE ALL TOWARD THE MOUTH
INCLINING OF THE NETHERMOST ABYSS
THE SITE OF EVERY VALLEY HENCE REQUIRES
THAT ONE SIDE UPWARD SLOPE THE OTHER FALL
AT LENGTH THE POINT OF OUR DESCENT WE REACH'D
FROM THE LAST FLAG SOON AS TO THAT ARRIV'D
SO WAS THE BREATH EXHAUSTED FROM MY LUNGS
I COULD NO FURTHER BUT DID SEAT ME THERE
NOW NEEDS THY BEST OF MAN SO SPAKE MY GUIDE
FOR NOT ON DOWNY PLUMES NOR UNDER SHADE
OF CANOPY REPOSING FAME IS WON
WITHOUT WHICH WHOSOE'ER CONSUMES HIS DAYS
LEAVETH SUCH VESTIGE OF HIMSELF ON EARTH
AS SMOKE IN AIR OR FOAM UPON THE WAVE
THOU THEREFORE RISE VANISH THY WEARINESS
BY THE MIND'S EFFORT IN EACH STRUGGLE FORM'D
TO VANQUISH IF SHE SUFFER NOT THE WEIGHT
OF HER CORPOREAL FRAME TO CRUSH HER DOWN
A LONGER LADDER YET REMAINS TO SCALE
FROM THESE TO HAVE ESCAP'D SUFFICETH NOT
IF WELL THOU NOTE ME PROFIT BY MY WORDS
I STRAIGHTWAY ROSE AND SHOW'D MYSELF LESS SPENT
THAN I IN TRUTH DID FEEL ME
ON I CRIED
FOR I AM STOUT AND FEARLESS UP THE ROCK
OUR WAY WE HELD MORE RUGGED THAN BEFORE
NARROWER AND STEEPER FAR TO CLIMB
FROM TALK
I CEAS'D NOT AS WE JOURNEY'D SO TO SEEM
LEAST FAINT WHEREAT A VOICE FROM THE OTHER FOSS
DID ISSUE FORTH FOR UTT'RANCE SUITED ILL
THOUGH ON THE ARCH THAT CROSSES THERE I STOOD
WHAT WERE THE WORDS I KNEW NOT BUT WHO SPAKE
SEEM'D MOV'D IN ANGER
DOWN I STOOP'D TO LOOK
BUT MY QUICK EYE MIGHT REACH NOT TO THE DEPTH
FOR SHROUDING DARKNESS WHEREFORE THUS I SPAKE
TO THE NEXT CIRCLE TEACHER BEND THY STEPS
AND FROM THE WALL DISMOUNT WE FOR AS HENCE
I HEAR AND UNDERSTAND NOT SO I SEE
BENEATH AND NAUGHT DISCERN I ANSWER NOT
SAID HE BUT BY THE DEED
TO FAIR REQUEST
SILENT PERFORMANCE MAKETH BEST RETURN
WE FROM THE BRIDGE'S HEAD DESCENDED WHERE
TO THE EIGHTH MOUND IT JOINS AND THEN THE CHASM
OPENING TO VIEW I SAW A CROWD WITHIN
OF SERPENTS TERRIBLE SO STRANGE OF SHAPE
AND HIDEOUS THAT REMEMBRANCE IN MY VEINS
YET SHRINKS THE VITAL CURRENT
OF HER SANDS
LET LYBIA VAUNT NO MORE IF JACULUS
PAREAS AND CHELYDER BE HER BROOD
CENCHRIS AND AMPHISBOENA PLAGUES SO DIRE
OR IN SUCH NUMBERS SWARMING NE'ER SHE SHEW'D
NOT WITH ALL ETHIOPIA AND WHATE'ER
ABOVE THE ERYTHRAEAN SEA IS SPAWN'D
AMID THIS DREAD EXUBERANCE OF WOE
RAN NAKED SPIRITS WING'D WITH HORRID FEAR
NOR HOPE HAD THEY OF CREVICE WHERE TO HIDE
OR HELIOTROPE TO CHARM THEM OUT OF VIEW
WITH SERPENTS WERE THEIR HANDS BEHIND THEM BOUND
WHICH THROUGH THEIR REINS INFIX'D THE TAIL AND HEAD
TWISTED IN FOLDS BEFORE
AND LO ON ONE
NEAR TO OUR SIDE DARTED AN ADDER UP
AND WHERE THE NECK IS ON THE SHOULDERS TIED
TRANSPIERC'D HIM
FAR MORE QUICKLY THAN E'ER PEN
WROTE O OR I HE KINDLED BURN'D AND CHANG'D
TO ASHES ALL POUR'D OUT UPON THE EARTH
WHEN THERE DISSOLV'D HE LAY THE DUST AGAIN
UPROLL'D SPONTANEOUS AND THE SELF SAME FORM
INSTANT RESUMED
SO MIGHTY SAGES TELL
THE' ARABIAN PHOENIX WHEN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
HAVE WELL NIGH CIRCLED DIES AND SPRINGS FORTHWITH
RENASCENT
BLADE NOR HERB THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE
HE TASTES BUT TEARS OF FRANKINCENSE ALONE
AND ODOROUS AMOMUM SWATHS OF NARD
AND MYRRH HIS FUNERAL SHROUD
AS ONE THAT FALLS
HE KNOWS NOT HOW BY FORCE DEMONIAC DRAGG'D
TO EARTH OR THROUGH OBSTRUCTION FETTERING UP
IN CHAINS INVISIBLE THE POWERS OF MAN
WHO RISEN FROM HIS TRANCE GAZETH AROUND
BEWILDER'D WITH THE MONSTROUS AGONY
HE HATH ENDUR'D AND WILDLY STARING SIGHS
SO STOOD AGHAST THE SINNER WHEN HE ROSE
OH HOW SEVERE GOD'S JUDGMENT THAT DEALS OUT
SUCH BLOWS IN STORMY VENGEANCE WHO HE WAS
MY TEACHER NEXT INQUIR'D AND THUS IN FEW
HE ANSWER'D VANNI FUCCI AM I CALL'D
NOT LONG SINCE RAINED DOWN FROM TUSCANY
TO THIS DIRE GULLET
ME THE BEASTIAL LIFE
AND NOT THE HUMAN PLEAS'D MULE THAT I WAS
WHO IN PISTOIA FOUND MY WORTHY DEN
I THEN TO VIRGIL BID HIM STIR NOT HENCE
AND ASK WHAT CRIME DID THRUST HIM HITHER ONCE
A MAN I KNEW HIM CHOLERIC AND BLOODY
THE SINNER HEARD AND FEIGN'D NOT BUT TOWARDS ME
HIS MIND DIRECTING AND HIS FACE WHEREIN
WAS DISMAL SHAME DEPICTUR'D THUS HE SPAKE
IT GRIEVES ME MORE TO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY THEE
IN THIS SAD PLIGHT WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST THAN
WHEN I WAS TAKEN FROM THE OTHER LIFE
I HAVE NO POWER PERMITTED TO DENY
WHAT THOU INQUIREST
I AM DOOM'D THUS LOW
TO DWELL FOR THAT THE SACRISTY BY ME
WAS RIFLED OF ITS GOODLY ORNAMENTS
AND WITH THE GUILT ANOTHER FALSELY CHARGED
BUT THAT THOU MAYST NOT JOY TO SEE ME THUS
SO AS THOU E'ER SHALT 'SCAPE THIS DARKSOME REALM
OPEN THINE EARS AND HEAR WHAT I FOREBODE
REFT OF THE NERI FIRST PISTOIA PINES
THEN FLORENCE CHANGETH CITIZENS AND LAWS
FROM VALDIMAGRA DRAWN BY WRATHFUL MARS
A VAPOUR RISES WRAPT IN TURBID MISTS
AND SHARP AND EAGER DRIVETH ON THE STORM
WITH ARROWY HURTLING O'ER PICENO'S FIELD
WHENCE SUDDENLY THE CLOUD SHALL BURST AND STRIKE
EACH HELPLESS BIANCO PROSTRATE TO THE GROUND
THIS HAVE I TOLD THAT GRIEF MAY REND THY HEART
CANTO XXV
WHEN HE HAD SPOKE THE SINNER RAIS'D HIS HANDS
POINTED IN MOCKERY AND CRIED TAKE THEM GOD
I LEVEL THEM AT THEE FROM THAT DAY FORTH
THE SERPENTS WERE MY FRIENDS FOR ROUND HIS NECK
ONE OF THEN ROLLING TWISTED AS IT SAID
BE SILENT TONGUE ANOTHER TO HIS ARMS
UPGLIDING TIED THEM RIVETING ITSELF
SO CLOSE IT TOOK FROM THEM THE POWER TO MOVE
PISTOIA AH PISTOIA WHY DOST DOUBT
TO TURN THEE INTO ASHES CUMB'RING EARTH
NO LONGER SINCE IN EVIL ACT SO FAR
THOU HAST OUTDONE THY SEED I DID NOT MARK
THROUGH ALL THE GLOOMY CIRCLES OF THE' ABYSS
SPIRIT THAT SWELL'D SO PROUDLY 'GAINST HIS GOD
NOT HIM WHO HEADLONG FELL FROM THEBES
HE FLED
NOR UTTER'D MORE AND AFTER HIM THERE CAME
A CENTAUR FULL OF FURY SHOUTING WHERE
WHERE IS THE CAITIFF ON MAREMMA'S MARSH
SWARM NOT THE SERPENT TRIBE AS ON HIS HAUNCH
THEY SWARM'D TO WHERE THE HUMAN FACE BEGINS
BEHIND HIS HEAD UPON THE SHOULDERS LAY
WITH OPEN WINGS A DRAGON BREATHING FIRE
ON WHOMSOE'ER HE MET
TO ME MY GUIDE
CACUS IS THIS WHO UNDERNEATH THE ROCK
OF AVENTINE SPREAD OFT A LAKE OF BLOOD
HE FROM HIS BRETHREN PARTED HERE MUST TREAD
A DIFFERENT JOURNEY FOR HIS FRAUDFUL THEFT
OF THE GREAT HERD THAT NEAR HIM STALL'D WHENCE FOUND
HIS FELON DEEDS THEIR END BENEATH THE MACE
OF STOUT ALCIDES THAT PERCHANCE LAID ON
A HUNDRED BLOWS AND NOT THE TENTH WAS FELT
WHILE YET HE SPAKE THE CENTAUR SPED AWAY
AND UNDER US THREE SPIRITS CAME OF WHOM
NOR I NOR HE WAS WARE TILL THEY EXCLAIM'D
SAY WHO ARE YE WE THEN BRAKE OFF DISCOURSE
INTENT ON THESE ALONE
I KNEW THEM NOT
BUT AS IT CHANCETH OFT BEFELL THAT ONE
HAD NEED TO NAME ANOTHER
WHERE SAID HE
DOTH CIANFA LURK I FOR A SIGN MY GUIDE
SHOULD STAND ATTENTIVE PLAC'D AGAINST MY LIPS
THE FINGER LIFTED
IF O READER NOW
THOU BE NOT APT TO CREDIT WHAT I TELL
NO MARVEL FOR MYSELF DO SCARCE ALLOW
THE WITNESS OF MINE EYES
BUT AS I LOOKED
TOWARD THEM LO A SERPENT WITH SIX FEET
SPRINGS FORTH ON ONE AND FASTENS FULL UPON HIM
HIS MIDMOST GRASP'D THE BELLY A FOREFOOT
SEIZ'D ON EACH ARM WHILE DEEP IN EITHER CHEEK
HE FLESH'D HIS FANGS THE HINDER ON THE THIGHS
WERE SPREAD 'TWIXT WHICH THE TAIL INSERTED CURL'D
UPON THE REINS BEHIND
IVY NE'ER CLASP'D
A DODDER'D OAK AS ROUND THE OTHER'S LIMBS
THE HIDEOUS MONSTER INTERTWIN'D HIS OWN
THEN AS THEY BOTH HAD BEEN OF BURNING WAX
EACH MELTED INTO OTHER MINGLING HUES
THAT WHICH WAS EITHER NOW WAS SEEN NO MORE
THUS UP THE SHRINKING PAPER ERE IT BURNS
A BROWN TINT GLIDES NOT TURNING YET TO BLACK
AND THE CLEAN WHITE EXPIRES
THE OTHER TWO
LOOK'D ON EXCLAIMING AH HOW DOST THOU CHANGE
AGNELLO SEE THOU ART NOR DOUBLE NOW
NOR ONLY ONE THE TWO HEADS NOW BECAME
ONE AND TWO FIGURES BLENDED IN ONE FORM
APPEAR'D WHERE BOTH WERE LOST
OF THE FOUR LENGTHS
TWO ARMS WERE MADE THE BELLY AND THE CHEST
THE THIGHS AND LEGS INTO SUCH MEMBERS CHANG'D
AS NEVER EYE HATH SEEN
OF FORMER SHAPE
ALL TRACE WAS VANISH'D
TWO YET NEITHER SEEM'D
THAT IMAGE MISCREATE AND SO PASS'D ON
WITH TARDY STEPS
AS UNDERNEATH THE SCOURGE
OF THE FIERCE DOG STAR THAT LAYS BARE THE FIELDS
SHIFTING FROM BRAKE TO BRAKE THE LIZARD SEEMS
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING IF HE THWART THE ROAD
SO TOWARD TH' ENTRAILS OF THE OTHER TWO
APPROACHING SEEM'D AN ADDER ALL ON FIRE
AS THE DARK PEPPER GRAIN LIVID AND SWART
IN THAT PART WHENCE OUR LIFE IS NOURISH'D FIRST
ONE HE TRANSPIERC'D THEN DOWN BEFORE HIM FELL
STRETCH'D OUT
THE PIERCED SPIRIT LOOK'D ON HIM
BUT SPAKE NOT YEA STOOD MOTIONLESS AND YAWN'D
AS IF BY SLEEP OR FEV'ROUS FIT ASSAIL'D
HE EY'D THE SERPENT AND THE SERPENT HIM
ONE FROM THE WOUND THE OTHER FROM THE MOUTH
BREATH'D A THICK SMOKE WHOSE VAP'RY COLUMNS JOIN'D
LUCAN IN MUTE ATTENTION NOW MAY HEAR
NOR THY DISASTROUS FATE SABELLUS TELL
NOR SHINE NASIDIUS OVID NOW BE MUTE
WHAT IF IN WARBLING FICTION HE RECORD
CADMUS AND ARETHUSA TO A SNAKE
HIM CHANG'D AND HER INTO A FOUNTAIN CLEAR
I ENVY NOT FOR NEVER FACE TO FACE
TWO NATURES THUS TRANSMUTED DID HE SING
WHEREIN BOTH SHAPES WERE READY TO ASSUME
THE OTHER'S SUBSTANCE
THEY IN MUTUAL GUISE
SO ANSWER'D THAT THE SERPENT SPLIT HIS TRAIN
DIVIDED TO A FORK AND THE PIERC'D SPIRIT
DREW CLOSE HIS STEPS TOGETHER LEGS AND THIGHS
COMPACTED THAT NO SIGN OF JUNCTURE SOON
WAS VISIBLE THE TAIL DISPARTED TOOK
THE FIGURE WHICH THE SPIRIT LOST ITS SKIN
SOFT'NING HIS INDURATED TO A RIND
THE SHOULDERS NEXT I MARK'D THAT ENT'RING JOIN'D
THE MONSTER'S ARM PITS WHOSE TWO SHORTER FEET
SO LENGTHEN'D AS THE OTHER'S DWINDLING SHRUNK
THE FEET BEHIND THEN TWISTING UP BECAME
THAT PART THAT MAN CONCEALS WHICH IN THE WRETCH
WAS CLEFT IN TWAIN
WHILE BOTH THE SHADOWY SMOKE
WITH A NEW COLOUR VEILS AND GENERATES
TH' EXCRESCENT PILE ON ONE PEELING IT OFF
FROM TH' OTHER BODY LO UPON HIS FEET
ONE UPRIGHT ROSE AND PRONE THE OTHER FELL
NOT YET THEIR GLARING AND MALIGNANT LAMPS
WERE SHIFTED THOUGH EACH FEATURE CHANG'D BENEATH
OF HIM WHO STOOD ERECT THE MOUNTING FACE
RETREATED TOWARDS THE TEMPLES AND WHAT THERE
SUPERFLUOUS MATTER CAME SHOT OUT IN EARS
FROM THE SMOOTH CHEEKS THE REST NOT BACKWARD DRAGG'D
OF ITS EXCESS DID SHAPE THE NOSE AND SWELL'D
INTO DUE SIZE PROTUBERANT THE LIPS
HE ON THE EARTH WHO LAY MEANWHILE EXTENDS
HIS SHARPEN'D VISAGE AND DRAWS DOWN THE EARS
INTO THE HEAD AS DOTH THE SLUG HIS HORNS
HIS TONGUE CONTINUOUS BEFORE AND APT
FOR UTT'RANCE SEVERS AND THE OTHER'S FORK
CLOSING UNITES
THAT DONE THE SMOKE WAS LAID
THE SOUL TRANSFORM'D INTO THE BRUTE GLIDES OFF
HISSING ALONG THE VALE AND AFTER HIM
THE OTHER TALKING SPUTTERS BUT SOON TURN'D
HIS NEW GROWN SHOULDERS ON HIM AND IN FEW
THUS TO ANOTHER SPAKE ALONG THIS PATH
CRAWLING AS I HAVE DONE SPEED BUOSO NOW
SO SAW I FLUCTUATE IN SUCCESSIVE CHANGE
TH' UNSTEADY BALLAST OF THE SEVENTH HOLD
AND HERE IF AUGHT MY TONGUE HAVE SWERV'D EVENTS
SO STRANGE MAY BE ITS WARRANT
O'ER MINE EYES
CONFUSION HUNG AND ON MY THOUGHTS AMAZE
YET 'SCAP'D THEY NOT SO COVERTLY BUT WELL
I MARK'D SCIANCATO HE ALONE IT WAS
OF THE THREE FIRST THAT CAME WHO CHANG'D NOT THOU
THE OTHER'S FATE GAVILLE STILL DOST RUE
CANTO XXVI
FLORENCE EXULT FOR THOU SO MIGHTILY
HAST THRIVEN THAT O'ER LAND AND SEA THY WINGS
THOU BEATEST AND THY NAME SPREADS OVER HELL
AMONG THE PLUND'RERS SUCH THE THREE I FOUND
THY CITIZENS WHENCE SHAME TO ME THY SON
AND NO PROUD HONOUR TO THYSELF REDOUNDS
BUT IF OUR MINDS WHEN DREAMING NEAR THE DAWN
ARE OF THE TRUTH PRESAGEFUL THOU ERE LONG
SHALT FEEL WHAT PRATO NOT TO SAY THE REST
WOULD FAIN MIGHT COME UPON THEE AND THAT CHANCE
WERE IN GOOD TIME IF IT BEFELL THEE NOW
WOULD SO IT WERE SINCE IT MUST NEEDS BEFALL
FOR AS TIME WEARS ME I SHALL GRIEVE THE MORE
WE FROM THE DEPTH DEPARTED AND MY GUIDE
REMOUNTING SCAL'D THE FLINTY STEPS WHICH LATE
WE DOWNWARD TRAC'D AND DREW ME UP THE STEEP
PURSUING THUS OUR SOLITARY WAY
AMONG THE CRAGS AND SPLINTERS OF THE ROCK
SPED NOT OUR FEET WITHOUT THE HELP OF HANDS
THEN SORROW SEIZ'D ME WHICH E'EN NOW REVIVES
AS MY THOUGHT TURNS AGAIN TO WHAT I SAW
AND MORE THAN I AM WONT I REIN AND CURB
THE POWERS OF NATURE IN ME LEST THEY RUN
WHERE VIRTUE GUIDES NOT THAT IF AUGHT OF GOOD
MY GENTLE STAR OR SOMETHING BETTER GAVE ME
I ENVY NOT MYSELF THE PRECIOUS BOON
AS IN THAT SEASON WHEN THE SUN LEAST VEILS
HIS FACE THAT LIGHTENS ALL WHAT TIME THE FLY
GIVES WAY TO THE SHRILL GNAT THE PEASANT THEN
UPON SOME CLIFF RECLIN'D BENEATH HIM SEES
FIRE FLIES INNUMEROUS SPANGLING O'ER THE VALE
VINEYARD OR TILTH WHERE HIS DAY LABOUR LIES
WITH FLAMES SO NUMBERLESS THROUGHOUT ITS SPACE
SHONE THE EIGHTH CHASM APPARENT WHEN THE DEPTH
WAS TO MY VIEW EXPOS'D
AS HE WHOSE WRONGS
THE BEARS AVENG'D AT ITS DEPARTURE SAW
ELIJAH'S CHARIOT WHEN THE STEEDS ERECT
RAIS'D THEIR STEEP FLIGHT FOR HEAV'N HIS EYES MEANWHILE
STRAINING PURSU'D THEM TILL THE FLAME ALONE
UPSOARING LIKE A MISTY SPECK HE KENN'D
E'EN THUS ALONG THE GULF MOVES EVERY FLAME
A SINNER SO ENFOLDED CLOSE IN EACH
THAT NONE EXHIBITS TOKEN OF THE THEFT
UPON THE BRIDGE I FORWARD BENT TO LOOK
AND GRASP'D A FLINTY MASS OR ELSE HAD FALL'N
THOUGH PUSH'D NOT FROM THE HEIGHT
THE GUIDE WHO MARK'D
HOW I DID GAZE ATTENTIVE THUS BEGAN
WITHIN THESE ARDOURS ARE THE SPIRITS EACH
SWATH'D IN CONFINING FIRE MASTER THY WORD
I ANSWER'D HATH ASSUR'D ME YET I DEEM'D
ALREADY OF THE TRUTH ALREADY WISH'D
TO ASK THEE WHO IS IN YON FIRE THAT COMES
SO PARTED AT THE SUMMIT AS IT SEEM'D
ASCENDING FROM THAT FUNERAL PILE WHERE LAY
THE THEBAN BROTHERS HE REPLIED WITHIN
ULYSSES THERE AND DIOMEDE ENDURE
THEIR PENAL TORTURES THUS TO VENGEANCE NOW
TOGETHER HASTING AS EREWHILE TO WRATH
THESE IN THE FLAME WITH CEASELESS GROANS DEPLORE
THE AMBUSH OF THE HORSE THAT OPEN'D WIDE
A PORTAL FOR THAT GOODLY SEED TO PASS
WHICH SOW'D IMPERIAL ROME NOR LESS THE GUILE
LAMENT THEY WHENCE OF HER ACHILLES 'REFT
DEIDAMIA YET IN DEATH COMPLAINS
AND THERE IS RUED THE STRATAGEM THAT TROY
OF HER PALLADIUM SPOIL'D IF THEY HAVE POWER
OF UTT'RANCE FROM WITHIN THESE SPARKS SAID I
O MASTER THINK MY PRAYER A THOUSAND FOLD
IN REPETITION URG'D THAT THOU VOUCHSAFE
TO PAUSE TILL HERE THE HORNED FLAME ARRIVE
SEE HOW TOWARD IT WITH DESIRE I BEND
HE THUS THY PRAYER IS WORTHY OF MUCH PRAISE
AND I ACCEPT IT THEREFORE BUT DO THOU
THY TONGUE REFRAIN TO QUESTION THEM BE MINE
FOR I DIVINE THY WISH AND THEY PERCHANCE
FOR THEY WERE GREEKS MIGHT SHUN DISCOURSE WITH THEE
WHEN THERE THE FLAME HAD COME WHERE TIME AND PLACE
SEEM'D FITTING TO MY GUIDE HE THUS BEGAN
O YE WHO DWELL TWO SPIRITS IN ONE FIRE
IF LIVING I OF YOU DID MERIT AUGHT
WHATE'ER THE MEASURE WERE OF THAT DESERT
WHEN IN THE WORLD MY LOFTY STRAIN I POUR'D
MOVE YE NOT ON TILL ONE OF YOU UNFOLD
IN WHAT CLIME DEATH O'ERTOOK HIM SELF DESTROY'D
OF THE OLD FLAME FORTHWITH THE GREATER HORN
BEGAN TO ROLL MURMURING AS A FIRE
THAT LABOURS WITH THE WIND THEN TO AND FRO
WAGGING THE TOP AS A TONGUE UTTERING SOUNDS
THREW OUT ITS VOICE AND SPAKE WHEN I ESCAP'D
FROM CIRCE WHO BEYOND A CIRCLING YEAR
HAD HELD ME NEAR CAIETA BY HER CHARMS
ERE THUS AENEAS YET HAD NAM'D THE SHORE
NOR FONDNESS FOR MY SON NOR REVERENCE
OF MY OLD FATHER NOR RETURN OF LOVE
THAT SHOULD HAVE CROWN'D PENELOPE WITH JOY
COULD OVERCOME IN ME THE ZEAL I HAD
T' EXPLORE THE WORLD AND SEARCH THE WAYS OF LIFE
MAN'S EVIL AND HIS VIRTUE
FORTH I SAIL'D
INTO THE DEEP ILLIMITABLE MAIN
WITH BUT ONE BARK AND THE SMALL FAITHFUL BAND
THAT YET CLEAV'D TO ME
AS IBERIA FAR
FAR AS MOROCCO EITHER SHORE I SAW
AND THE SARDINIAN AND EACH ISLE BESIDE
WHICH ROUND THAT OCEAN BATHES
TARDY WITH AGE
WERE I AND MY COMPANIONS WHEN WE CAME
TO THE STRAIT PASS WHERE HERCULES ORDAIN'D
THE BOUND'RIES NOT TO BE O'ERSTEPP'D BY MAN
THE WALLS OF SEVILLE TO MY RIGHT I LEFT
ON THE' OTHER HAND ALREADY CEUTA PAST
O BROTHERS I BEGAN WHO TO THE WEST
THROUGH PERILS WITHOUT NUMBER NOW HAVE REACH'D
TO THIS THE SHORT REMAINING WATCH THAT YET
OUR SENSES HAVE TO WAKE REFUSE NOT PROOF
OF THE UNPEOPLED WORLD FOLLOWING THE TRACK
OF PHOEBUS
CALL TO MIND FROM WHENCE WE SPRANG
YE WERE NOT FORM'D TO LIVE THE LIFE OF BRUTES
BUT VIRTUE TO PURSUE AND KNOWLEDGE HIGH
WITH THESE FEW WORDS I SHARPEN'D FOR THE VOYAGE
THE MIND OF MY ASSOCIATES THAT I THEN
COULD SCARCELY HAVE WITHHELD THEM
TO THE DAWN
OUR POOP WE TURN'D AND FOR THE WITLESS FLIGHT
MADE OUR OARS WINGS STILL GAINING ON THE LEFT
EACH STAR OF THE' OTHER POLE NIGHT NOW BEHELD
AND OURS SO LOW THAT FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR
IT ROSE NOT
FIVE TIMES RE ILLUM'D AS OFT
VANISH'D THE LIGHT FROM UNDERNEATH THE MOON
SINCE THE DEEP WAY WE ENTER'D WHEN FROM FAR
APPEAR'D A MOUNTAIN DIM LOFTIEST METHOUGHT
OF ALL I E'ER BEHELD
JOY SEIZ'D US STRAIGHT
BUT SOON TO MOURNING CHANGED
FROM THE NEW LAND
A WHIRLWIND SPRUNG AND AT HER FOREMOST SIDE
DID STRIKE THE VESSEL
THRICE IT WHIRL'D HER ROUND
WITH ALL THE WAVES THE FOURTH TIME LIFTED UP
THE POOP AND SANK THE PROW SO FATE DECREED
AND OVER US THE BOOMING BILLOW CLOS'D
CANTO XVII
NOW UPWARD ROSE THE FLAME AND STILL'D ITS LIGHT
TO SPEAK NO MORE AND NOW PASS'D ON WITH LEAVE
FROM THE MILD POET GAIN'D WHEN FOLLOWING CAME
ANOTHER FROM WHOSE TOP A SOUND CONFUS'D
FORTH ISSUING DREW OUR EYES THAT WAY TO LOOK
AS THE SICILIAN BULL THAT RIGHTFULLY
HIS CRIES FIRST ECHOED WHO HAD SHAP'D ITS MOULD
DID SO REBELLOW WITH THE VOICE OF HIM
TORMENTED THAT THE BRAZEN MONSTER SEEM'D
PIERC'D THROUGH WITH PAIN THUS WHILE NO WAY THEY FOUND
NOR AVENUE IMMEDIATE THROUGH THE FLAME
INTO ITS LANGUAGE TURN'D THE DISMAL WORDS
BUT SOON AS THEY HAD WON THEIR PASSAGE FORTH
UP FROM THE POINT WHICH VIBRATING OBEY'D
THEIR MOTION AT THE TONGUE THESE SOUNDS WE HEARD
O THOU TO WHOM I NOW DIRECT MY VOICE
THAT LATELY DIDST EXCLAIM IN LOMBARD PHRASE
DEPART THOU I SOLICIT THEE NO MORE
THOUGH SOMEWHAT TARDY I PERCHANCE ARRIVE
LET IT NOT IRK THEE HERE TO PAUSE AWHILE
AND WITH ME PARLEY LO IT IRKS NOT ME
AND YET I BURN
IF BUT E'EN NOW THOU FALL
INTO THIS BLIND WORLD FROM THAT PLEASANT LAND
OF LATIUM WHENCE I DRAW MY SUM OF GUILT
TELL ME IF THOSE WHO IN ROMAGNA DWELL
HAVE PEACE OR WAR
FOR OF THE MOUNTAINS THERE
WAS I BETWIXT URBINO AND THE HEIGHT
WHENCE TYBER FIRST UNLOCKS HIS MIGHTY FLOOD
LEANING I LISTEN'D YET WITH HEEDFUL EAR
WHEN AS HE TOUCH'D MY SIDE THE LEADER THUS
SPEAK THOU HE IS A LATIAN MY REPLY
WAS READY AND I SPAKE WITHOUT DELAY
O SPIRIT WHO ART HIDDEN HERE BELOW
NEVER WAS THY ROMAGNA WITHOUT WAR
IN HER PROUD TYRANTS' BOSOMS NOR IS NOW
BUT OPEN WAR THERE LEFT I NONE
THE STATE
RAVENNA HATH MAINTAIN'D THIS MANY A YEAR
IS STEADFAST
THERE POLENTA'S EAGLE BROODS
AND IN HIS BROAD CIRCUMFERENCE OF PLUME
O'ERSHADOWS CERVIA
THE GREEN TALONS GRASP
THE LAND THAT STOOD EREWHILE THE PROOF SO LONG
AND PIL'D IN BLOODY HEAP THE HOST OF FRANCE
THE' OLD MASTIFF OF VERRUCHIO AND THE YOUNG
THAT TORE MONTAGNA IN THEIR WRATH STILL MAKE
WHERE THEY ARE WONT AN AUGRE OF THEIR FANGS
LAMONE'S CITY AND SANTERNO'S RANGE
UNDER THE LION OF THE SNOWY LAIR
INCONSTANT PARTISAN THAT CHANGETH SIDES
OR EVER SUMMER YIELDS TO WINTER'S FROST
AND SHE WHOSE FLANK IS WASH'D OF SAVIO'S WAVE
AS 'TWIXT THE LEVEL AND THE STEEP SHE LIES
LIVES SO 'TWIXT TYRANT POWER AND LIBERTY
NOW TELL US I ENTREAT THEE WHO ART THOU
BE NOT MORE HARD THAN OTHERS
IN THE WORLD
SO MAY THY NAME STILL REAR ITS FOREHEAD HIGH
THEN ROAR'D AWHILE THE FIRE ITS SHARPEN'D POINT
ON EITHER SIDE WAV'D AND THUS BREATH'D AT LAST
IF I DID THINK MY ANSWER WERE TO ONE
WHO EVER COULD RETURN UNTO THE WORLD
THIS FLAME SHOULD REST UNSHAKEN
BUT SINCE NE'ER
IF TRUE BE TOLD ME ANY FROM THIS DEPTH
HAS FOUND HIS UPWARD WAY I ANSWER THEE
NOR FEAR LEST INFAMY RECORD THE WORDS
A MAN OF ARMS AT FIRST I CLOTH'D ME THEN
IN GOOD SAINT FRANCIS' GIRDLE HOPING SO
T' HAVE MADE AMENDS
AND CERTAINLY MY HOPE
HAD FAIL'D NOT BUT THAT HE WHOM CURSES LIGHT ON
THE' HIGH PRIEST AGAIN SEDUC'D ME INTO SIN
AND HOW AND WHEREFORE LISTEN WHILE I TELL
LONG AS THIS SPIRIT MOV'D THE BONES AND PULP
MY MOTHER GAVE ME LESS MY DEEDS BESPAKE
THE NATURE OF THE LION THAN THE FOX
ALL WAYS OF WINDING SUBTLETY I KNEW
AND WITH SUCH ART CONDUCTED THAT THE SOUND
REACH'D THE WORLD'S LIMIT
SOON AS TO THAT PART
OF LIFE I FOUND ME COME WHEN EACH BEHOVES
TO LOWER SAILS AND GATHER IN THE LINES
THAT WHICH BEFORE HAD PLEASED ME THEN I RUED
AND TO REPENTANCE AND CONFESSION TURN'D
WRETCH THAT I WAS AND WELL IT HAD BESTED ME
THE CHIEF OF THE NEW PHARISEES MEANTIME
WAGING HIS WARFARE NEAR THE LATERAN
NOT WITH THE SARACENS OR JEWS HIS FOES
ALL CHRISTIANS WERE NOR AGAINST ACRE ONE
HAD FOUGHT NOR TRAFFIC'D IN THE SOLDAN'S LAND
HE HIS GREAT CHARGE NOR SACRED MINISTRY
IN HIMSELF REV'RENC'D NOR IN ME THAT CORD
WHICH US'D TO MARK WITH LEANNESS WHOM IT GIRDED
AS IN SOCRATE CONSTANTINE BESOUGHT
TO CURE HIS LEPROSY SYLVESTER'S AID
SO ME TO CURE THE FEVER OF HIS PRIDE
THIS MAN BESOUGHT MY COUNSEL TO THAT END
HE ASK'D AND I WAS SILENT FOR HIS WORDS
SEEM'D DRUNKEN BUT FORTHWITH HE THUS RESUM'D
'FROM THY HEART BANISH FEAR OF ALL OFFENCE
I HITHERTO ABSOLVE THEE
IN RETURN
TEACH ME MY PURPOSE SO TO EXECUTE
THAT PENESTRINO CUMBER EARTH NO MORE
HEAV'N AS THOU KNOWEST I HAVE POWER TO SHUT
AND OPEN AND THE KEYS ARE THEREFORE TWAIN
THE WHICH MY PREDECESSOR MEANLY PRIZ'D
THEN YIELDING TO THE FORCEFUL ARGUMENTS
OF SILENCE AS MORE PERILOUS I DEEM'D
AND ANSWER'D FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME
CLEAR OF THAT GUILT WHEREIN I NOW MUST FALL
LARGE PROMISE WITH PERFORMANCE SCANT BE SURE
SHALL MAKE THEE TRIUMPH IN THY LOFTY SEAT
WHEN I WAS NUMBER'D WITH THE DEAD THEN CAME
SAINT FRANCIS FOR ME BUT A CHERUB DARK
HE MET WHO CRIED 'WRONG ME NOT HE IS MINE
AND MUST BELOW TO JOIN THE WRETCHED CREW
FOR THE DECEITFUL COUNSEL WHICH HE GAVE
E'ER SINCE I WATCH'D HIM HOV'RING AT HIS HAIR
NO POWER CAN THE IMPENITENT ABSOLVE
NOR TO REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE CONSIST
BY CONTRADICTION ABSOLUTE FORBID
OH MIS'RY HOW I SHOOK MYSELF WHEN HE
SEIZ'D ME AND CRIED THOU HAPLY THOUGHT'ST ME NOT
A DISPUTANT IN LOGIC SO EXACT
TO MINOS DOWN HE BORE ME AND THE JUDGE
TWIN'D EIGHT TIMES ROUND HIS CALLOUS BACK THE TAIL
WHICH BITING WITH EXCESS OF RAGE HE SPAKE
THIS IS A GUILTY SOUL THAT IN THE FIRE
MUST VANISH
HENCE PERDITION DOOM'D I ROVE
A PREY TO RANKLING SORROW IN THIS GARB
WHEN HE HAD THUS FULFILL'D HIS WORDS THE FLAME
IN DOLOUR PARTED BEATING TO AND FRO
AND WRITHING ITS SHARP HORN
WE ONWARD WENT
I AND MY LEADER UP ALONG THE ROCK
FAR AS ANOTHER ARCH THAT OVERHANGS
THE FOSS WHEREIN THE PENALTY IS PAID
OF THOSE WHO LOAD THEM WITH COMMITTED SIN
CANTO XXVIII
WHO E'EN IN WORDS UNFETTER'D MIGHT AT FULL
TELL OF THE WOUNDS AND BLOOD THAT NOW I SAW
THOUGH HE REPEATED OFT THE TALE NO TONGUE
SO VAST A THEME COULD EQUAL SPEECH AND THOUGHT
BOTH IMPOTENT ALIKE
IF IN ONE BAND
COLLECTED STOOD THE PEOPLE ALL WHO E'ER
POUR'D ON APULIA'S HAPPY SOIL THEIR BLOOD
SLAIN BY THE TROJANS AND IN THAT LONG WAR
WHEN OF THE RINGS THE MEASUR'D BOOTY MADE
A PILE SO HIGH AS ROME'S HISTORIAN WRITES
WHO ERRS NOT WITH THE MULTITUDE THAT FELT
THE GRINDING FORCE OF GUISCARD'S NORMAN STEEL
AND THOSE THE REST WHOSE BONES ARE GATHER'D YET
AT CEPERANO THERE WHERE TREACHERY
BRANDED TH' APULIAN NAME OR WHERE BEYOND
THY WALLS O TAGLIACOZZO WITHOUT ARMS
THE OLD ALARDO CONQUER'D AND HIS LIMBS
ONE WERE TO SHOW TRANSPIERC'D ANOTHER HIS
CLEAN LOPT AWAY A SPECTACLE LIKE THIS
WERE BUT A THING OF NOUGHT TO THE' HIDEOUS SIGHT
OF THE NINTH CHASM
A RUNDLET THAT HATH LOST
ITS MIDDLE OR SIDE STAVE GAPES NOT SO WIDE
AS ONE I MARK'D TORN FROM THE CHIN THROUGHOUT
DOWN TO THE HINDER PASSAGE 'TWIXT THE LEGS
DANGLING HIS ENTRAILS HUNG THE MIDRIFF LAY
OPEN TO VIEW AND WRETCHED VENTRICLE
THAT TURNS TH' ENGLUTTED ALIMENT TO DROSS
WHILST EAGERLY I FIX ON HIM MY GAZE
HE EY'D ME WITH HIS HANDS LAID HIS BREAST BARE
AND CRIED NOW MARK HOW I DO RIP ME LO
HOW IS MOHAMMED MANGLED BEFORE ME
WALKS ALI WEEPING FROM THE CHIN HIS FACE
CLEFT TO THE FORELOCK AND THE OTHERS ALL
WHOM HERE THOU SEEST WHILE THEY LIV'D DID SOW
SCANDAL AND SCHISM AND THEREFORE THUS ARE RENT

FULL TRIAL OF YOUR STATE I WHO AM DEAD

FORTHWITH HE LAID HIS HAND ON THE CHEEK BONE
OF ONE HIS FELLOW SPIRIT AND HIS JAWS
EXPANDING CRIED LO THIS IS HE I WOT OF
HE SPEAKS NOT FOR HIMSELF THE OUTCAST THIS
WHO OVERWHELM'D THE DOUBT IN CAESAR'S MIND
AFFIRMING THAT DELAY TO MEN PREPAR'D
WAS EVER HARMFUL OH HOW TERRIFIED
METHOUGHT WAS CURIO FROM WHOSE THROAT WAS CUT
THE TONGUE WHICH SPAKE THAT HARDY WORD
THEN ONE
MAIM'D OF EACH HAND UPLIFTED IN THE GLOOM
THE BLEEDING STUMPS THAT THEY WITH GORY SPOTS
SULLIED HIS FACE AND CRIED 'REMEMBER THEE
OF MOSCA TOO I WHO ALAS EXCLAIM'D
'THE DEED ONCE DONE THERE IS AN END THAT PROV'D
A SEED OF SORROW TO THE TUSCAN RACE
I ADDED AY AND DEATH TO THINE OWN TRIBE
WHENCE HEAPING WOE ON WOE HE HURRIED OFF
AS ONE GRIEF STUNG TO MADNESS
BUT I THERE
STILL LINGER'D TO BEHOLD THE TROOP AND SAW
THINGS SUCH AS I MAY FEAR WITHOUT MORE PROOF
TO TELL OF BUT THAT CONSCIENCE MAKES ME FIRM
THE BOON COMPANION WHO HER STRONG BREAST PLATE
BUCKLES ON HIM THAT FEELS NO GUILT WITHIN
AND BIDS HIM ON AND FEAR NOT
WITHOUT DOUBT
I SAW AND YET IT SEEMS TO PASS BEFORE ME
A HEADLESS TRUNK THAT EVEN AS THE REST
OF THE SAD FLOCK PAC'D ONWARD
BY THE HAIR
IT BORE THE SEVER'D MEMBER LANTERN WISE
PENDENT IN HAND WHICH LOOK'D AT US AND SAID
WOE'S ME THE SPIRIT LIGHTED THUS HIMSELF

HOW THAT MAY BE HE KNOWS WHO ORDERETH SO

SPURRING THEM ON MALICIOUSLY TO STRIFE
FOR PARTING THOSE SO CLOSELY KNIT MY BRAIN
PARTED ALAS I CARRY FROM ITS SOURCE
THAT IN THIS TRUNK INHABITS
THUS THE LAW
OF RETRIBUTION FIERCELY WORKS IN ME
CANTO XXIX
SO WERE MINE EYES INEBRIATE WITH VIEW
OF THE VAST MULTITUDE WHOM VARIOUS WOUNDS
DISFIGUR'D THAT THEY LONG'D TO STAY AND WEEP
BUT VIRGIL ROUS'D ME WHAT YET GAZEST ON
WHEREFORE DOTH FASTEN YET THY SIGHT BELOW
AMONG THE MAIM'D AND MISERABLE SHADES
THOU HAST NOT SHEWN IN ANY CHASM BESIDE
THIS WEAKNESS
KNOW IF THOU WOULDST NUMBER THEM
THAT TWO AND TWENTY MILES THE VALLEY WINDS
ITS CIRCUIT AND ALREADY IS THE MOON
BENEATH OUR FEET THE TIME PERMITTED NOW
IS SHORT AND MORE NOT SEEN REMAINS TO SEE
IF THOU I STRAIGHT REPLIED HADST WEIGH'D THE CAUSE
FOR WHICH I LOOK'D THOU HADST PERCHANCE EXCUS'D
THE TARRYING STILL MY LEADER PART PURSU'D
HIS WAY THE WHILE I FOLLOW'D ANSWERING HIM
AND ADDING THUS WITHIN THAT CAVE I DEEM
WHEREON SO FIXEDLY I HELD MY KEN
THERE IS A SPIRIT DWELLS ONE OF MY BLOOD
WAILING THE CRIME THAT COSTS HIM NOW SO DEAR
THEN SPAKE MY MASTER LET THY SOUL NO MORE
AFFLICT ITSELF FOR HIM
DIRECT ELSEWHERE
ITS THOUGHT AND LEAVE HIM
AT THE BRIDGE'S FOOT
I MARK'D HOW HE DID POINT WITH MENACING LOOK
AT THEE AND HEARD HIM BY THE OTHERS NAM'D
GERI OF BELLO
THOU SO WHOLLY THEN
WERT BUSIED WITH HIS SPIRIT WHO ONCE RUL'D
THE TOWERS OF HAUTEFORT THAT THOU LOOKEDST NOT
THAT WAY ERE HE WAS GONE O GUIDE BELOV'D
HIS VIOLENT DEATH YET UNAVENG'D SAID I
BY ANY WHO ARE PARTNERS IN HIS SHAME
MADE HIM CONTEMPTUOUS THEREFORE AS I THINK
HE PASS'D ME SPEECHLESS BY AND DOING SO
HATH MADE ME MORE COMPASSIONATE HIS FATE
SO WE DISCOURS'D TO WHERE THE ROCK FIRST SHOW'D
THE OTHER VALLEY HAD MORE LIGHT BEEN THERE
E'EN TO THE LOWEST DEPTH
SOON AS WE CAME
O'ER THE LAST CLOISTER IN THE DISMAL ROUNDS
OF MALEBOLGE AND THE BROTHERHOOD
WERE TO OUR VIEW EXPOS'D THEN MANY A DART
OF SORE LAMENT ASSAIL'D ME HEADED ALL
WITH POINTS OF THRILLING PITY THAT I CLOS'D
BOTH EARS AGAINST THE VOLLEY WITH MINE HANDS
AS WERE THE TORMENT IF EACH LAZAR HOUSE
OF VALDICHIANA IN THE SULTRY TIME
'TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER WITH THE ISLE
SARDINIA AND MAREMMA'S PESTILENT FEN
HAD HEAP'D THEIR MALADIES ALL IN ONE FOSS
TOGETHER SUCH WAS HERE THE TORMENT DIRE
THE STENCH AS ISSUING STEAMS FROM FESTER'D LIMBS
WE ON THE UTMOST SHORE OF THE LONG ROCK
DESCENDED STILL TO LEFTWARD
THEN MY SIGHT
WAS LIVELIER TO EXPLORE THE DEPTH WHEREIN
THE MINISTER OF THE MOST MIGHTY LORD
ALL SEARCHING JUSTICE DOOMS TO PUNISHMENT
THE FORGERS NOTED ON HER DREAD RECORD
MORE RUEFUL WAS IT NOT METHINKS TO SEE
THE NATION IN AEGINA DROOP WHAT TIME
EACH LIVING THING E'EN TO THE LITTLE WORM
ALL FELL SO FULL OF MALICE WAS THE AIR
AND AFTERWARD AS BARDS OF YORE HAVE TOLD
THE ANCIENT PEOPLE WERE RESTOR'D ANEW
FROM SEED OF EMMETS THAN WAS HERE TO SEE
THE SPIRITS THAT LANGUISH'D THROUGH THE MURKY VALE
UP PIL'D ON MANY A STACK
CONFUS'D THEY LAY
ONE O'ER THE BELLY O'ER THE SHOULDERS ONE
ROLL'D OF ANOTHER SIDELING CRAWL'D A THIRD
ALONG THE DISMAL PATHWAY
STEP BY STEP
WE JOURNEY'D ON IN SILENCE LOOKING ROUND
AND LIST'NING THOSE DISEAS'D WHO STROVE IN VAIN
TO LIFT THEIR FORMS
THEN TWO I MARK'D THAT SAT
PROPP'D 'GAINST EACH OTHER AS TWO BRAZEN PANS
SET TO RETAIN THE HEAT
FROM HEAD TO FOOT
A TETTER BARK'D THEM ROUND
NOR SAW I E'ER
GROOM CURRYING SO FAST FOR WHOM HIS LORD
IMPATIENT WAITED OR HIMSELF PERCHANCE
TIR'D WITH LONG WATCHING AS OF THESE EACH ONE
PLIED QUICKLY HIS KEEN NAILS THROUGH FURIOUSNESS
OF NE'ER ABATED PRURIENCY
THE CRUST
CAME DRAWN FROM UNDERNEATH IN FLAKES LIKE SCALES
SCRAP'D FROM THE BREAM OR FISH OF BROADER MAIL
O THOU WHO WITH THY FINGERS RENDEST OFF
THY COAT OF PROOF THUS SPAKE MY GUIDE TO ONE
AND SOMETIMES MAKEST TEARING PINCERS OF THEM
TELL ME IF ANY BORN OF LATIAN LAND
BE AMONG THESE WITHIN SO MAY THY NAILS
SERVE THEE FOR EVERLASTING TO THIS TOIL
BOTH ARE OF LATIUM WEEPING HE REPLIED
WHOM TORTUR'D THUS THOU SEEST BUT WHO ART THOU
THAT HAST INQUIR'D OF US TO WHOM MY GUIDE
ONE THAT DESCEND WITH THIS MAN WHO YET LIVES
FROM ROCK TO ROCK AND SHOW HIM HELL'S ABYSS
THEN STARTED THEY ASUNDER AND EACH TURN'D
TREMBLING TOWARD US WITH THE REST WHOSE EAR
THOSE WORDS REDOUNDING STRUCK
TO ME MY LIEGE
ADDRESS'D HIM SPEAK TO THEM WHATE'ER THOU LIST
AND I THEREWITH BEGAN SO MAY NO TIME
FILCH YOUR REMEMBRANCE FROM THE THOUGHTS OF MEN
IN TH' UPPER WORLD BUT AFTER MANY SUNS
SURVIVE IT AS YE TELL ME WHO YE ARE
AND OF WHAT RACE YE COME
YOUR PUNISHMENT
UNSEEMLY AND DISGUSTFUL IN ITS KIND
DETER YOU NOT FROM OPENING THUS MUCH TO ME
AREZZO WAS MY DWELLING ANSWER'D ONE
AND ME ALBERO OF SIENNA BROUGHT
TO DIE BY FIRE BUT THAT FOR WHICH I DIED
LEADS ME NOT HERE
TRUE IS IN SPORT I TOLD HIM
THAT I HAD LEARN'D TO WING MY FLIGHT IN AIR
AND HE ADMIRING MUCH AS HE WAS VOID
OF WISDOM WILL'D ME TO DECLARE TO HIM
THE SECRET OF MINE ART AND ONLY HENCE
BECAUSE I MADE HIM NOT A DAEDALUS
PREVAIL'D ON ONE SUPPOS'D HIS SIRE TO BURN ME
BUT MINOS TO THIS CHASM LAST OF THE TEN
FOR THAT I PRACTIS'D ALCHEMY ON EARTH
HAS DOOM'D ME
HIM NO SUBTERFUGE ELUDES
THEN TO THE BARD I SPAKE WAS EVER RACE
LIGHT AS SIENNA'S SURE NOT FRANCE HERSELF
CAN SHOW A TRIBE SO FRIVOLOUS AND VAIN
THE OTHER LEPROUS SPIRIT HEARD MY WORDS
AND THUS RETURN'D BE STRICCA FROM THIS CHARGE
EXEMPTED HE WHO KNEW SO TEMP'RATELY
TO LAY OUT FORTUNE'S GIFTS AND NICCOLO
WHO FIRST THE SPICE'S COSTLY LUXURY
DISCOVER'D IN THAT GARDEN WHERE SUCH SEED
ROOTS DEEPEST IN THE SOIL AND BE THAT TROOP
EXEMPTED WITH WHOM CACCIA OF ASCIANO
LAVISH'D HIS VINEYARDS AND WIDE SPREADING WOODS
AND HIS RARE WISDOM ABBAGLIATO SHOW'D
A SPECTACLE FOR ALL
THAT THOU MAYST KNOW
WHO SECONDS THEE AGAINST THE SIENNESE
THUS GLADLY BEND THIS WAY THY SHARPEN'D SIGHT
THAT WELL MY FACE MAY ANSWER TO THY KEN
SO SHALT THOU SEE I AM CAPOCCHIO'S GHOST
WHO FORG'D TRANSMUTED METALS BY THE POWER
OF ALCHEMY AND IF I SCAN THEE RIGHT
THUS NEEDS MUST WELL REMEMBER HOW I APED
CREATIVE NATURE BY MY SUBTLE ART
CANTO XXX
WHAT TIME RESENTMENT BURN'D IN JUNO'S BREAST
FOR SEMELE AGAINST THE THEBAN BLOOD
AS MORE THAN ONCE IN DIRE MISCHANCE WAS RUED
SUCH FATAL FRENZY SEIZ'D ON ATHAMAS
THAT HE HIS SPOUSE BEHOLDING WITH A BABE
LADEN ON EITHER ARM SPREAD OUT HE CRIED
THE MESHES THAT I TAKE THE LIONESS
AND THE YOUNG LIONS AT THE PASS THEN FORTH
STRETCH'D HE HIS MERCILESS TALONS GRASPING ONE
ONE HELPLESS INNOCENT LEARCHUS NAM'D
WHOM SWINGING DOWN HE DASH'D UPON A ROCK
AND WITH HER OTHER BURDEN SELF DESTROY'D
THE HAPLESS MOTHER PLUNG'D AND WHEN THE PRIDE
OF ALL PRESUMING TROY FELL FROM ITS HEIGHT
BY FORTUNE OVERWHELM'D AND THE OLD KING
WITH HIS REALM PERISH'D THEN DID HECUBA
A WRETCH FORLORN AND CAPTIVE WHEN SHE SAW
POLYXENA FIRST SLAUGHTER'D AND HER SON
HER POLYDORUS ON THE WILD SEA BEACH
NEXT MET THE MOURNER'S VIEW THEN REFT OF SENSE
DID SHE RUN BARKING EVEN AS A DOG
SUCH MIGHTY POWER HAD GRIEF TO WRENCH HER SOUL
BET NE'ER THE FURIES OR OF THEBES OR TROY
WITH SUCH FELL CRUELTY WERE SEEN THEIR GOADS
INFIXING IN THE LIMBS OF MAN OR BEAST
AS NOW TWO PALE AND NAKED GHOST I SAW
THAT GNARLING WILDLY SCAMPER'D LIKE THE SWINE
EXCLUDED FROM HIS STYE
ONE REACH'D CAPOCCHIO
AND IN THE NECK JOINT STICKING DEEP HIS FANGS
DRAGG'D HIM THAT O'ER THE SOLID PAVEMENT RUBB'D
HIS BELLY STRETCH'D OUT PRONE
THE OTHER SHAPE
HE OF AREZZO THERE LEFT TREMBLING SPAKE
THAT SPRITE OF AIR IS SCHICCHI IN LIKE MOOD
OF RANDOM MISCHIEF VENT HE STILL HIS SPITE
TO WHOM I ANSW'RING OH AS THOU DOST HOPE
THE OTHER MAY NOT FLESH ITS JAWS ON THEE
BE PATIENT TO INFORM US WHO IT IS
ERE IT SPEED HENCE THAT IS THE ANCIENT SOUL
OF WRETCHED MYRRHA HE REPLIED WHO BURN'D
WITH MOST UNHOLY FLAME FOR HER OWN SIRE
AND A FALSE SHAPE ASSUMING SO PERFORM'D
THE DEED OF SIN E'EN AS THE OTHER THERE
THAT ONWARD PASSES DAR'D TO COUNTERFEIT
DONATI'S FEATURES TO FEIGN'D TESTAMENT
THE SEAL AFFIXING THAT HIMSELF MIGHT GAIN
FOR HIS OWN SHARE THE LADY OF THE HERD
WHEN VANISH'D THE TWO FURIOUS SHADES ON WHOM
MINE EYE WAS HELD I TURN'D IT BACK TO VIEW
THE OTHER CURSED SPIRITS
ONE I SAW
IN FASHION LIKE A LUTE HAD BUT THE GROIN
BEEN SEVER'D WHERE IT MEETS THE FORKED PART
SWOLN DROPSY DISPROPORTIONING THE LIMBS
WITH ILL CONVERTED MOISTURE THAT THE PAUNCH
SUITS NOT THE VISAGE OPEN'D WIDE HIS LIPS
GASPING AS IN THE HECTIC MAN FOR DROUGHT
ONE TOWARDS THE CHIN THE OTHER UPWARD CURL'D
O YE WHO IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY
WHEREFORE I KNOW NOT ARE EXEMPT FROM PAIN
THUS HE BEGAN ATTENTIVELY REGARD
ADAMO'S WOE
WHEN LIVING FULL SUPPLY
NE'ER LACK'D ME OF WHAT MOST I COVETED
ONE DROP OF WATER NOW ALAS I CRAVE
THE RILLS THAT GLITTER DOWN THE GRASSY SLOPES
OF CASENTINO MAKING FRESH AND SOFT
THE BANKS WHEREBY THEY GLIDE TO ARNO'S STREAM
STAND EVER IN MY VIEW AND NOT IN VAIN
FOR MORE THE PICTUR'D SEMBLANCE DRIES ME UP
MUCH MORE THAN THE DISEASE WHICH MAKES THE FLESH
DESERT THESE SHRIVEL'D CHEEKS
SO FROM THE PLACE
WHERE I TRANSGRESS'D STERN JUSTICE URGING ME
TAKES MEANS TO QUICKEN MORE MY LAB'RING SIGHS
THERE IS ROMENA WHERE I FALSIFIED
THE METAL WITH THE BAPTIST'S FORM IMPREST
FOR WHICH ON EARTH I LEFT MY BODY BURNT
BUT IF I HERE MIGHT SEE THE SORROWING SOUL
OF GUIDO ALESSANDRO OR THEIR BROTHER
FOR BRANDA'S LIMPID SPRING I WOULD NOT CHANGE
THE WELCOME SIGHT
ONE IS E'EN NOW WITHIN
IF TRULY THE MAD SPIRITS TELL THAT ROUND
ARE WAND'RING
BUT WHEREIN BESTEADS ME THAT
MY LIMBS ARE FETTER'D
WERE I BUT SO LIGHT
THAT I EACH HUNDRED YEARS MIGHT MOVE ONE INCH
I HAD SET FORTH ALREADY ON THIS PATH
SEEKING HIM OUT AMIDST THE SHAPELESS CREW
ALTHOUGH ELEVEN MILES IT WIND NOT MORE
THAN HALF OF ONE ACROSS
THEY BROUGHT ME DOWN
AMONG THIS TRIBE INDUC'D BY THEM I STAMP'D
THE FLORENS WITH THREE CARATS OF ALLOY
WHO ARE THAT ABJECT PAIR I NEXT INQUIR'D
THAT CLOSELY BOUNDING THEE UPON THY RIGHT
LIE SMOKING LIKE A BAND IN WINTER STEEP'D
IN THE CHILL STREAM WHEN TO THIS GULF I DROPT
HE ANSWER'D HERE I FOUND THEM SINCE THAT HOUR
THEY HAVE NOT TURN'D NOR EVER SHALL I WEEN
TILL TIME HATH RUN HIS COURSE
ONE IS THAT DAME
THE FALSE ACCUSER OF THE HEBREW YOUTH
SINON THE OTHER THAT FALSE GREEK FROM TROY
SHARP FEVER DRAINS THE REEKY MOISTNESS OUT
IN SUCH A CLOUD UPSTEAM'D WHEN THAT HE HEARD
ONE GALL'D PERCHANCE TO BE SO DARKLY NAM'D
WITH CLENCH'D HAND SMOTE HIM ON THE BRACED PAUNCH
THAT LIKE A DRUM RESOUNDED BUT FORTHWITH
ADAMO SMOTE HIM ON THE FACE THE BLOW
RETURNING WITH HIS ARM THAT SEEM'D AS HARD
THOUGH MY O'ERWEIGHTY LIMBS HAVE TA'EN FROM ME
THE POWER TO MOVE SAID HE I HAVE AN ARM
AT LIBERTY FOR SUCH EMPLOY TO WHOM
WAS ANSWER'D WHEN THOU WENTEST TO THE FIRE
THOU HADST IT NOT SO READY AT COMMAND
THEN READIER WHEN IT COIN'D TH' IMPOSTOR GOLD
AND THUS THE DROPSIED AY NOW SPEAK'ST THOU TRUE
BUT THERE THOU GAV'ST NOT SUCH TRUE TESTIMONY
WHEN THOU WAST QUESTION'D OF THE TRUTH AT TROY
IF I SPAKE FALSE THOU FALSELY STAMP'DST THE COIN
SAID SINON I AM HERE BUT FOR ONE FAULT
AND THOU FOR MORE THAN ANY IMP BESIDE
REMEMBER HE REPLIED O PERJUR'D ONE
THE HORSE REMEMBER THAT DID TEEM WITH DEATH
AND ALL THE WORLD BE WITNESS TO THY GUILT
TO THINE RETURN'D THE GREEK WITNESS THE THIRST
WHENCE THY TONGUE CRACKS WITNESS THE FLUID MOUND
REAR'D BY THY BELLY UP BEFORE THINE EYES
A MASS CORRUPT TO WHOM THE COINER THUS
THY MOUTH GAPES WIDE AS EVER TO LET PASS
ITS EVIL SAYING
ME IF THIRST ASSAILS
YET I AM STUFF'D WITH MOISTURE
THOU ART PARCH'D
PAINS RACK THY HEAD NO URGING WOULD'ST THOU NEED
TO MAKE THEE LAP NARCISSUS' MIRROR UP
I WAS ALL FIX'D TO LISTEN WHEN MY GUIDE
ADMONISH'D NOW BEWARE A LITTLE MORE
AND I DO QUARREL WITH THEE I PERCEIV'D
HOW ANGRILY HE SPAKE AND TOWARDS HIM TURN'D
WITH SHAME SO POIGNANT AS REMEMBER'D YET
CONFOUNDS ME
AS A MAN THAT DREAMS OF HARM
BEFALL'N HIM DREAMING WISHES IT A DREAM
AND THAT WHICH IS DESIRES AS IF IT WERE NOT
SUCH THEN WAS I WHO WANTING POWER TO SPEAK
WISH'D TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND ALL THE WHILE
EXCUS'D ME THOUGH UNWEETING THAT I DID
MORE GRIEVOUS FAULT THAN THINE HAS BEEN LESS SHAME
MY MASTER CRIED MIGHT EXPIATE
THEREFORE CAST
ALL SORROW FROM THY SOUL AND IF AGAIN
CHANCE BRING THEE WHERE LIKE CONFERENCE IS HELD
THINK I AM EVER AT THY SIDE
TO HEAR
SUCH WRANGLING IS A JOY FOR VULGAR MINDS
CANTO XXXI
THE VERY TONGUE WHOSE KEEN REPROOF BEFORE
HAD WOUNDED ME THAT EITHER CHEEK WAS STAIN'D
NOW MINISTER'D MY CURE
SO HAVE I HEARD
ACHILLES AND HIS FATHER'S JAVELIN CAUS'D
PAIN FIRST AND THEN THE BOON OF HEALTH RESTOR'D
TURNING OUR BACK UPON THE VALE OF WOE
W CROSS'D TH' ENCIRCLED MOUND IN SILENCE
THERE
WAS TWILIGHT DIM THAT FAR LONG THE GLOOM
MINE EYE ADVANC'D NOT BUT I HEARD A HORN
SOUNDED ALOUD
THE PEAL IT BLEW HAD MADE
THE THUNDER FEEBLE
FOLLOWING ITS COURSE
THE ADVERSE WAY MY STRAINED EYES WERE BENT
ON THAT ONE SPOT
SO TERRIBLE A BLAST
ORLANDO BLEW NOT WHEN THAT DISMAL ROUT
O'ERTHREW THE HOST OF CHARLEMAGNE AND QUENCH'D
HIS SAINTLY WARFARE
THITHERWARD NOT LONG
MY HEAD WAS RAIS'D WHEN MANY LOFTY TOWERS
METHOUGHT I SPIED
MASTER SAID I WHAT LAND
IS THIS HE ANSWER'D STRAIGHT TOO LONG A SPACE
OF INTERVENING DARKNESS HAS THINE EYE
TO TRAVERSE THOU HAST THEREFORE WIDELY ERR'D
IN THY IMAGINING
THITHER ARRIV'D
THOU WELL SHALT SEE HOW DISTANCE CAN DELUDE
THE SENSE
A LITTLE THEREFORE URGE THEE ON
THEN TENDERLY HE CAUGHT ME BY THE HAND
YET KNOW SAID HE ERE FARTHER WE ADVANCE
THAT IT LESS STRANGE MAY SEEM THESE ARE NOT TOWERS
BUT GIANTS
IN THE PIT THEY STAND IMMERS'D
EACH FROM HIS NAVEL DOWNWARD ROUND THE BANK
AS WHEN A FOG DISPERSETH GRADUALLY
OUR VISION TRACES WHAT THE MIST INVOLVES
CONDENS'D IN AIR SO PIERCING THROUGH THE GROSS
AND GLOOMY ATMOSPHERE AS MORE AND MORE
WE NEAR'D TOWARD THE BRINK MINE ERROR FLED
AND FEAR CAME O'ER ME
AS WITH CIRCLING ROUND
OF TURRETS MONTEREGGION CROWNS HIS WALLS
E'EN THUS THE SHORE ENCOMPASSING TH' ABYSS
WAS TURRETED WITH GIANTS HALF THEIR LENGTH
UPREARING HORRIBLE WHOM JOVE FROM HEAV'N
YET THREATENS WHEN HIS MUTT'RING THUNDER ROLLS
OF ONE ALREADY I DESCRIED THE FACE
SHOULDERS AND BREAST AND OF THE BELLY HUGE
GREAT PART AND BOTH ARMS DOWN ALONG HIS RIBS
ALL TEEMING NATURE WHEN HER PLASTIC HAND
LEFT FRAMING OF THESE MONSTERS DID DISPLAY
PAST DOUBT HER WISDOM TAKING FROM MAD WAR
SUCH SLAVES TO DO HIS BIDDING AND IF SHE
REPENT HER NOT OF TH' ELEPHANT AND WHALE
WHO PONDERS WELL CONFESSES HER THEREIN
WISER AND MORE DISCREET FOR WHEN BRUTE FORCE
AND EVIL WILL ARE BACK'D WITH SUBTLETY
RESISTANCE NONE AVAILS
HIS VISAGE SEEM'D
IN LENGTH AND BULK AS DOTH THE PINE THAT TOPS
SAINT PETER'S ROMAN FANE AND TH' OTHER BONES
OF LIKE PROPORTION SO THAT FROM ABOVE
THE BANK WHICH GIRDLED HIM BELOW SUCH HEIGHT
AROSE HIS STATURE THAT THREE FRIEZELANDERS
HAD STRIV'N IN VAIN TO REACH BUT TO HIS HAIR
FULL THIRTY AMPLE PALMS WAS HE EXPOS'D
DOWNWARD FROM WHENCE A MAN HIS GARMENTS LOOPS
RAPHEL BAI AMETH SABI ALMI
SO SHOUTED HIS FIERCE LIPS WHICH SWEETER HYMNS
BECAME NOT AND MY GUIDE ADDRESS'D HIM THUS
O SENSELESS SPIRIT LET THY HORN FOR THEE
INTERPRET THEREWITH VENT THY RAGE IF RAGE
OR OTHER PASSION WRING THEE
SEARCH THY NECK
THERE SHALT THOU FIND THE BELT THAT BINDS IT ON
WILD SPIRIT LO UPON THY MIGHTY BREAST
WHERE HANGS THE BALDRICK THEN TO ME HE SPAKE
HE DOTH ACCUSE HIMSELF
NIMROD IS THIS
THROUGH WHOSE ILL COUNSEL IN THE WORLD NO MORE
ONE TONGUE PREVAILS
BUT PASS WE ON NOR WASTE
OUR WORDS FOR SO EACH LANGUAGE IS TO HIM
AS HIS TO OTHERS UNDERSTOOD BY NONE
THEN TO THE LEFTWARD TURNING SPED WE FORTH
AND AT A SLING'S THROW FOUND ANOTHER SHADE
FAR FIERCER AND MORE HUGE
I CANNOT SAY
WHAT MASTER HAND HAD GIRT HIM BUT HE HELD
BEHIND THE RIGHT ARM FETTER'D AND BEFORE
THE OTHER WITH A CHAIN THAT FASTEN'D HIM
FROM THE NECK DOWN AND FIVE TIMES ROUND HIS FORM
APPARENT MET THE WREATHED LINKS
THIS PROUD ONE
WOULD OF HIS STRENGTH AGAINST ALMIGHTY JOVE
MAKE TRIAL SAID MY GUIDE WHENCE HE IS THUS
REQUITED EPHIALTES HIM THEY CALL
GREAT WAS HIS PROWESS WHEN THE GIANTS BROUGHT
FEAR ON THE GODS THOSE ARMS WHICH THEN HE PILED
NOW MOVES HE NEVER FORTHWITH I RETURN'D
FAIN WOULD I IF 'T WERE POSSIBLE MINE EYES
OF BRIAREUS IMMEASURABLE GAIN'D
EXPERIENCE NEXT HE ANSWER'D THOU SHALT SEE
NOT FAR FROM HENCE ANTAEUS WHO BOTH SPEAKS
AND IS UNFETTER'D WHO SHALL PLACE US THERE
WHERE GUILT IS AT ITS DEPTH
FAR ONWARD STANDS
WHOM THOU WOULDST FAIN BEHOLD IN CHAINS AND MADE
LIKE TO THIS SPIRIT SAVE THAT IN HIS LOOKS
MORE FELL HE SEEMS BY VIOLENT EARTHQUAKE ROCK'D
NE'ER SHOOK A TOW'R SO REELING TO ITS BASE
AS EPHIALTES
MORE THAN EVER THEN
I DREADED DEATH NOR THAN THE TERROR MORE
HAD NEEDED IF I HAD NOT SEEN THE CORDS
THAT HELD HIM FAST
WE STRAIGHTWAY JOURNEYING ON
CAME TO ANTAEUS WHO FIVE ELLS COMPLETE
WITHOUT THE HEAD FORTH ISSUED FROM THE CAVE
O THOU WHO IN THE FORTUNATE VALE THAT MADE
GREAT SCIPIO HEIR OF GLORY WHEN HIS SWORD
DROVE BACK THE TROOP OF HANNIBAL IN FLIGHT
WHO THENCE OF OLD DIDST CARRY FOR THY SPOIL
AN HUNDRED LIONS AND IF THOU HADST FOUGHT
IN THE HIGH CONFLICT ON THY BRETHREN'S SIDE
SEEMS AS MEN YET BELIEV'D THAT THROUGH THINE ARM
THE SONS OF EARTH HAD CONQUER'D NOW VOUCHSAFE
TO PLACE US DOWN BENEATH WHERE NUMBING COLD
LOCKS UP COCYTUS
FORCE NOT THAT WE CRAVE
OR TITYUS' HELP OR TYPHON'S

RENOWN ON THEE FOR HE DOTH LIVE AND LOOKS

AND CAUGHT MY GUIDE
ALCIDES WHILOM FELT
THAT GRAPPLE STRAIGHTEN'D SCORE
SOON AS MY GUIDE
HAD FELT IT HE BESPAKE ME THUS THIS WAY
THAT I MAY CLASP THEE THEN SO CAUGHT ME UP
THAT WE WERE BOTH ONE BURDEN
AS APPEARS
THE TOWER OF CARISENDA FROM BENEATH
WHERE IT DOTH LEAN IF CHANCE A PASSING CLOUD
SO SAIL ACROSS THAT OPPOSITE IT HANGS
SUCH THEN ANTAEUS SEEM'D AS AT MINE EASE
I MARK'D HIM STOOPING
I WERE FAIN AT TIMES
T' HAVE PASS'D ANOTHER WAY
YET IN TH' ABYSS
THAT LUCIFER WITH JUDAS LOW INGULFS
LIGHTLY HE PLAC'D US NOR THERE LEANING STAY'D
BUT ROSE AS IN A BARK THE STATELY MAST
CANTO XXXII
COULD I COMMAND ROUGH RHIMES AND HOARSE TO SUIT
THAT HOLE OF SORROW O'ER WHICH EV'RY ROCK
HIS FIRM ABUTMENT REARS THEN MIGHT THE VEIN
OF FANCY RISE FULL SPRINGING BUT NOT MINE
SUCH MEASURES AND WITH FALT'RING AWE I TOUCH
THE MIGHTY THEME FOR TO DESCRIBE THE DEPTH
OF ALL THE UNIVERSE IS NO EMPRIZE
TO JEST WITH AND DEMANDS A TONGUE NOT US'D
TO INFANT BABBLING
BUT LET THEM ASSIST
MY SONG THE TUNEFUL MAIDENS BY WHOSE AID
AMPHION WALL'D IN THEBES SO WITH THE TRUTH
MY SPEECH SHALL BEST ACCORD
OH ILL STARR'D FOLK
BEYOND ALL OTHERS WRETCHED WHO ABIDE
IN SUCH A MANSION AS SCARCE THOUGHT FINDS WORDS
TO SPEAK OF BETTER HAD YE HERE ON EARTH
BEEN FLOCKS OR MOUNTAIN GOATS
AS DOWN WE STOOD
IN THE DARK PIT BENEATH THE GIANTS' FEET
BUT LOWER FAR THAN THEY AND I DID GAZE
STILL ON THE LOFTY BATTLEMENT A VOICE
BESPOKE ME THUS LOOK HOW THOU WALKEST
TAKE
GOOD HEED THY SOLES DO TREAD NOT ON THE HEADS
OF THY POOR BRETHREN THEREUPON I TURN'D
AND SAW BEFORE AND UNDERNEATH MY FEET
A LAKE WHOSE FROZEN SURFACE LIKER SEEM'D
TO GLASS THAN WATER
NOT SO THICK A VEIL
IN WINTER E'ER HATH AUSTRIAN DANUBE SPREAD
O'ER HIS STILL COURSE NOR TANAIS FAR REMOTE
UNDER THE CHILLING SKY
ROLL'D O'ER THAT MASS
HAD TABERNICH OR PIETRAPANA FALL'N
NOT E'EN ITS RIM HAD CREAK'D
AS PEEPS THE FROG
CROAKING ABOVE THE WAVE WHAT TIME IN DREAMS
THE VILLAGE GLEANER OFT PURSUES HER TOIL
SO TO WHERE MODEST SHAME APPEARS THUS LOW
BLUE PINCH'D AND SHRIN'D IN ICE THE SPIRITS STOOD
MOVING THEIR TEETH IN SHRILL NOTE LIKE THE STORK
HIS FACE EACH DOWNWARD HELD THEIR MOUTH THE COLD
THEIR EYES EXPRESS'D THE DOLOUR OF THEIR HEART
A SPACE I LOOK'D AROUND THEN AT MY FEET
SAW TWO SO STRICTLY JOIN'D THAT OF THEIR HEAD
THE VERY HAIRS WERE MINGLED
TELL ME YE
WHOSE BOSOMS THUS TOGETHER PRESS SAID I
WHO ARE YE AT THAT SOUND THEIR NECKS THEY BENT
AND WHEN THEIR LOOKS WERE LIFTED UP TO ME
STRAIGHTWAY THEIR EYES BEFORE ALL MOIST WITHIN
DISTILL'D UPON THEIR LIPS AND THE FROST BOUND
THE TEARS BETWIXT THOSE ORBS AND HELD THEM THERE
PLANK UNTO PLANK HATH NEVER CRAMP CLOS'D UP
SO STOUTLY
WHENCE LIKE TWO ENRAGED GOATS
THEY CLASH'D TOGETHER THEM SUCH FURY SEIZ'D
AND ONE FROM WHOM THE COLD BOTH EARS HAD REFT
EXCLAIM'D STILL LOOKING DOWNWARD WHY ON US
DOST SPECULATE SO LONG IF THOU WOULDST KNOW
WHO ARE THESE TWO THE VALLEY WHENCE HIS WAVE
BISENZIO SLOPES DID FOR ITS MASTER OWN
THEIR SIRE ALBERTO AND NEXT HIM THEMSELVES

CAINA THOU MAYST SEARCH NOR FIND A SHADE
MORE WORTHY IN CONGEALMENT TO BE FIX'D
NOT HIM WHOSE BREAST AND SHADOW ARTHUR'S LAND
AT THAT ONE BLOW DISSEVER'D NOT FOCACCIA
NO NOT THIS SPIRIT WHOSE O'ERJUTTING HEAD

A SHIV'RING HORROR O'ER ME AT THE THOUGHT
OF THOSE FRORE SHALLOWS
WHILE WE JOURNEY'D ON
TOWARD THE MIDDLE AT WHOSE POINT UNITES
ALL HEAVY SUBSTANCE AND I TREMBLING WENT
THROUGH THAT ETERNAL CHILLNESS I KNOW NOT
IF WILL IT WERE OR DESTINY OR CHANCE
BUT PASSING 'MIDST THE HEADS MY FOOT DID STRIKE
WITH VIOLENT BLOW AGAINST THE FACE OF ONE
WHEREFORE DOST BRUISE ME WEEPING HE EXCLAIM'D
UNLESS THY ERRAND BE SOME FRESH REVENGE
FOR MONTAPERTO WHEREFORE TROUBLEST ME

THAT I THROUGH HIM MAY RID ME OF MY DOUBT
THENCEFORTH WHAT HASTE THOU WILT THE TEACHER PAUS'D
AND TO THAT SHADE I SPAKE WHO BITTERLY

THAT WITH THE REST I MAY THY NAME ENROL
THE CONTRARY OF WHAT I COVET MOST

WE NOW HAD LEFT HIM PASSING ON OUR WAY
WHEN I BEHELD TWO SPIRITS BY THE ICE

DID SO APPLY HIS FANGS TO TH' OTHER'S BRAIN
WHERE THE SPINE JOINS IT

MAY PERISH IN THE WATERS WHAT IF FAME
REPORTED THAT THY CASTLES WERE BETRAY'D
BY UGOLINO YET NO RIGHT HADST THOU
TO STRETCH HIS CHILDREN ON THE RACK

BRIGATA UGACCIONE AND THE PAIR
OF GENTLE ONES OF WHOM MY SONG HATH TOLD
THEIR TENDER YEARS THOU MODERN THEBES DID MAKE
UNCAPABLE OF GUILT

FOR AT THEIR EYES GRIEF SEEKING PASSAGE FINDS
IMPEDIMENT AND ROLLING INWARD TURNS
FOR INCREASE OF SHARP ANGUISH THE FIRST TEARS
HANG CLUSTER'D AND LIKE CRYSTAL VIZORS SHOW
UNDER THE SOCKET BRIMMING ALL THE CUP
NOW THOUGH THE COLD HAD FROM MY FACE DISLODG'D
EACH FEELING AS 'T WERE CALLOUS YET ME SEEM'D
SOME BREATH OF WIND I FELT
WHENCE COMETH THIS
SAID I MY MASTER IS NOT HERE BELOW

O SOULS SO CRUEL THAT THE FARTHEST POST
HATH BEEN ASSIGN'D YOU FROM THIS FACE REMOVE
THE HARDEN'D VEIL THAT I MAY VENT THE GRIEF
IMPREGNATE AT MY HEART SOME LITTLE SPACE
ERE IT CONGEAL AGAIN I THUS REPLIED
SAY WHO THOU WAST IF THOU WOULDST HAVE MINE AID
AND IF I EXTRICATE THEE NOT FAR DOWN
AS TO THE LOWEST ICE MAY I DESCEND
THE FRIAR ALBERIGO ANSWERED HE

MORE LUSCIOUS FOR MY FIG HAH I EXCLAIM'D
ART THOU TOO DEAD HOW IN THE WORLD ALOFT
IT FARETH WITH MY BODY ANSWER'D HE
I AM RIGHT IGNORANT
SUCH PRIVILEGE
HATH PTOLOMEA THAT OFTTIMES THE SOUL
DROPS HITHER ERE BY ATROPOS DIVORC'D
AND THAT THOU MAYST WIPE OUT MORE WILLINGLY
THE GLAZED TEAR DROPS THAT O'ERLAY MINE EYES
KNOW THAT THE SOUL THAT MOMENT SHE BETRAYS
AS I DID YIELDS HER BODY TO A FIEND
WHO AFTER MOVES AND GOVERNS IT AT WILL
TILL ALL ITS TIME BE ROUNDED HEADLONG SHE
FALLS TO THIS CISTERN
AND PERCHANCE ABOVE
DOTH YET APPEAR THE BODY OF A GHOST
WHO HERE BEHIND ME WINTERS

IF THOU BUT NEWLY ART ARRIV'D BELOW
THE YEARS ARE MANY THAT HAVE PASS'D AWAY
SINCE TO THIS FASTNESS BRANCA DORIA CAME
NOW ANSWER'D I METHINKS THOU MOCKEST ME
FOR BRANCA DORIA NEVER YET HATH DIED
BUT DOTH ALL NATURAL FUNCTIONS OF A MAN
EATS DRINKS AND SLEEPS AND PUTTETH RAIMENT ON
HE THUS NOT YET UNTO THAT UPPER FOSS
BY TH' EVIL TALONS GUARDED WHERE THE PITCH
TENACIOUS BOILS HAD MICHAEL ZANCHE REACH'D
WHEN THIS ONE LEFT A DEMON IN HIS STEAD
IN HIS OWN BODY AND OF ONE HIS KIN
WHO WITH HIM TREACHERY WROUGHT
BUT NOW PUT FORTH
THY HAND AND OPE MINE EYES I OP'D THEM NOT
ILL MANNERS WERE BEST COURTESY TO HIM
AH GENOESE MEN PERVERSE IN EVERY WAY
WITH EVERY FOULNESS STAIN'D WHY FROM THE EARTH
ARE YE NOT CANCEL'D SUCH AN ONE OF YOURS
I WITH ROMAGNA'S DARKEST SPIRIT FOUND
AS FOR HIS DOINGS EVEN NOW IN SOUL
IS IN COCYTUS PLUNG'D AND YET DOTH SEEM
IN BODY STILL ALIVE UPON THE EARTH
CANTO XXXIV
THE BANNERS OF HELL'S MONARCH DO COME FORTH
TOWARDS US THEREFORE LOOK SO SPAKE MY GUIDE
IF THOU DISCERN HIM AS WHEN BREATHES A CLOUD
HEAVY AND DENSE OR WHEN THE SHADES OF NIGHT
FALL ON OUR HEMISPHERE SEEMS VIEW'D FROM FAR
A WINDMILL WHICH THE BLAST STIRS BRISKLY ROUND
SUCH WAS THE FABRIC THEN METHOUGHT I SAW
TO SHIELD ME FROM THE WIND FORTHWITH I DREW
BEHIND MY GUIDE NO COVERT ELSE WAS THERE
NOW CAME I AND WITH FEAR I BID MY STRAIN
RECORD THE MARVEL WHERE THE SOULS WERE ALL
WHELM'D UNDERNEATH TRANSPARENT AS THROUGH GLASS
PELLUCID THE FRAIL STEM
SOME PRONE WERE LAID
OTHERS STOOD UPRIGHT THIS UPON THE SOLES
THAT ON HIS HEAD A THIRD WITH FACE TO FEET
ARCH'D LIKE A BOW
WHEN TO THE POINT WE CAME
WHEREAT MY GUIDE WAS PLEAS'D THAT I SHOULD SEE
THE CREATURE EMINENT IN BEAUTY ONCE
HE FROM BEFORE ME STEPP'D AND MADE ME PAUSE
LO HE EXCLAIM'D LO DIS AND LO THE PLACE
WHERE THOU HAST NEED TO ARM THY HEART WITH STRENGTH
HOW FROZEN AND HOW FAINT I THEN BECAME
ASK ME NOT READER FOR I WRITE IT NOT
SINCE WORDS WOULD FAIL TO TELL THEE OF MY STATE
I WAS NOT DEAD NOR LIVING
THINK THYSELF
IF QUICK CONCEPTION WORK IN THEE AT ALL
HOW I DID FEEL
THAT EMPEROR WHO SWAYS
THE REALM OF SORROW AT MID BREAST FROM TH' ICE
STOOD FORTH AND I IN STATURE AM MORE LIKE
A GIANT THAN THE GIANTS ARE IN HIS ARMS
MARK NOW HOW GREAT THAT WHOLE MUST BE WHICH SUITS
WITH SUCH A PART
IF HE WERE BEAUTIFUL
AS HE IS HIDEOUS NOW AND YET DID DARE
TO SCOWL UPON HIS MAKER WELL FROM HIM
MAY ALL OUR MIS'RY FLOW
OH WHAT A SIGHT
HOW PASSING STRANGE IT SEEM'D WHEN I DID SPY
UPON HIS HEAD THREE FACES ONE IN FRONT
OF HUE VERMILION TH' OTHER TWO WITH THIS
MIDWAY EACH SHOULDER JOIN'D AND AT THE CREST
THE RIGHT 'TWIXT WAN AND YELLOW SEEM'D THE LEFT
TO LOOK ON SUCH AS COME FROM WHENCE OLD NILE
STOOPS TO THE LOWLANDS
UNDER EACH SHOT FORTH
TWO MIGHTY WINGS ENORMOUS AS BECAME
A BIRD SO VAST
SAILS NEVER SUCH I SAW
OUTSTRETCH'D ON THE WIDE SEA
NO PLUMES HAD THEY
BUT WERE IN TEXTURE LIKE A BAT AND THESE
HE FLAPP'D I' TH' AIR THAT FROM HIM ISSUED STILL
THREE WINDS WHEREWITH COCYTUS TO ITS DEPTH
WAS FROZEN
AT SIX EYES HE WEPT THE TEARS
ADOWN THREE CHINS DISTILL'D WITH BLOODY FOAM
AT EVERY MOUTH HIS TEETH A SINNER CHAMP'D
BRUIS'D AS WITH POND'ROUS ENGINE SO THAT THREE
WERE IN THIS GUISE TORMENTED
BUT FAR MORE
THAN FROM THAT GNAWING WAS THE FOREMOST PANG'D
BY THE FIERCE RENDING WHENCE OFTTIMES THE BACK
WAS STRIPT OF ALL ITS SKIN
THAT UPPER SPIRIT
WHO HATH WORSE PUNISHMENT SO SPAKE MY GUIDE
IS JUDAS HE THAT HATH HIS HEAD WITHIN
AND PLIES THE FEET WITHOUT
OF TH' OTHER TWO
WHOSE HEADS ARE UNDER FROM THE MURKY JAW
WHO HANGS IS BRUTUS LO HOW HE DOTH WRITHE
AND SPEAKS NOT TH' OTHER CASSIUS THAT APPEARS
SO LARGE OF LIMB
BUT NIGHT NOW RE ASCENDS
AND IT IS TIME FOR PARTING
ALL IS SEEN
I CLIPP'D HIM ROUND THE NECK FOR SO HE BADE
AND NOTING TIME AND PLACE HE WHEN THE WINGS
ENOUGH WERE OP'D CAUGHT FAST THE SHAGGY SIDES
AND DOWN FROM PILE TO PILE DESCENDING STEPP'D
BETWEEN THE THICK FELL AND THE JAGGED ICE
SOON AS HE REACH'D THE POINT WHEREAT THE THIGH
UPON THE SWELLING OF THE HAUNCHES TURNS
MY LEADER THERE WITH PAIN AND STRUGGLING HARD
TURN'D ROUND HIS HEAD WHERE HIS FEET STOOD BEFORE
AND GRAPPLED AT THE FELL AS ONE WHO MOUNTS
THAT INTO HELL METHOUGHT WE TURN'D AGAIN
EXPECT THAT BY SUCH STAIRS AS THESE THUS SPAKE
THE TEACHER PANTING LIKE A MAN FORESPENT
WE MUST DEPART FROM EVIL SO EXTREME
THEN AT A ROCKY OPENING ISSUED FORTH
AND PLAC'D ME ON A BRINK TO SIT NEXT JOIN'D
WITH WARY STEP MY SIDE
I RAIS'D MINE EYES
BELIEVING THAT I LUCIFER SHOULD SEE
WHERE HE WAS LATELY LEFT BUT SAW HIM NOW
WITH LEGS HELD UPWARD
LET THE GROSSER SORT
WHO SEE NOT WHAT THE POINT WAS I HAD PASS'D
BETHINK THEM IF SORE TOIL OPPRESS'D ME THEN
ARISE MY MASTER CRIED UPON THY FEET
THE WAY IS LONG AND MUCH UNCOUTH THE ROAD
AND NOW WITHIN ONE HOUR AND HALF OF NOON
THE SUN RETURNS IT WAS NO PALACE HALL
LOFTY AND LUMINOUS WHEREIN WE STOOD
BUT NATURAL DUNGEON WHERE ILL FOOTING WAS
AND SCANT SUPPLY OF LIGHT
ERE FROM TH' ABYSS
I SEP'RATE THUS WHEN RISEN I BEGAN
MY GUIDE VOUCHSAFE FEW WORDS TO SET ME FREE
FROM ERROR'S THRALLDOM
WHERE IS NOW THE ICE
HOW STANDETH HE IN POSTURE THUS REVERS'D
AND HOW FROM EVE TO MORN IN SPACE SO BRIEF
HATH THE SUN MADE HIS TRANSIT HE IN FEW
THUS ANSWERING SPAKE THOU DEEMEST THOU ART STILL
ON TH' OTHER SIDE THE CENTRE WHERE I GRASP'D
TH' ABHORRED WORM THAT BORETH THROUGH THE WORLD
THOU WAST ON TH' OTHER SIDE SO LONG AS I
DESCENDED WHEN I TURN'D THOU DIDST O'ERPASS
THAT POINT TO WHICH FROM EV'RY PART IS DRAGG'D
ALL HEAVY SUBSTANCE
THOU ART NOW ARRIV'D
UNDER THE HEMISPHERE OPPOSED TO THAT
WHICH THE GREAT CONTINENT DOTH OVERSPREAD
AND UNDERNEATH WHOSE CANOPY EXPIR'D
THE MAN THAT WAS BORN SINLESS AND SO LIV'D
THY FEET ARE PLANTED ON THE SMALLEST SPHERE
WHOSE OTHER ASPECT IS JUDECCA
MORN
HERE RISES WHEN THERE EVENING SETS AND HE
WHOSE SHAGGY PILE WAS SCAL'D YET STANDETH FIX'D
AS AT THE FIRST
ON THIS PART HE FELL DOWN
FROM HEAV'N AND TH' EARTH HERE PROMINENT BEFORE
THROUGH FEAR OF HIM DID VEIL HER WITH THE SEA
AND TO OUR HEMISPHERE RETIR'D
PERCHANCE
TO SHUN HIM WAS THE VACANT SPACE LEFT HERE
BY WHAT OF FIRM LAND ON THIS SIDE APPEARS
THAT SPRANG ALOOF THERE IS A PLACE BENEATH
FROM BELZEBUB AS DISTANT AS EXTENDS
THE VAULTED TOMB DISCOVER'D NOT BY SIGHT
BUT BY THE SOUND OF BROOKLET THAT DESCENDS
THIS WAY ALONG THE HOLLOW OF A ROCK
WHICH AS IT WINDS WITH NO PRECIPITOUS COURSE
THE WAVE HATH EATEN
BY THAT HIDDEN WAY
MY GUIDE AND I DID ENTER TO RETURN
TO THE FAIR WORLD AND HEEDLESS OF REPOSE
WE CLIMBED HE FIRST I FOLLOWING HIS STEPS
TILL ON OUR VIEW THE BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS OF HEAV'N
DAWN'D THROUGH A CIRCULAR OPENING IN THE CAVE
THUS ISSUING WE AGAIN BEHELD THE STARS
