NICE TO MEET YOU WHERE YOU BEEN
I COULD SHOW YOU INCREDIBLE THINGS
MAGIC MADNESS HEAVEN SIN
SAW YOU THERE AND I THOUGHT
OH MY GOD LOOK AT THAT FACE
YOU LOOK LIKE MY NEXT MISTAKE
LOVE'S A GAME WANNA PLAY
NEW MONEY SUIT AND TIE
I CAN READ YOU LIKE A MAGAZINE
AIN'T IT FUNNY RUMORS FLY
AND I KNOW YOU HEARD ABOUT ME
SO HEY LET'S BE FRIENDS
I'M DYING TO SEE HOW THIS ONE ENDS
GRAB YOUR PASSPORT AND MY HAND
I CAN MAKE THE BAD GUYS GOOD FOR A WEEKEND
SO IT'S GONNA BE FOREVER
OR IT'S GONNA GO DOWN IN FLAMES
YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER
IF THE HIGH WAS WORTH THE PAIN
GOT A LONG LIST OF EX LOVERS
THEY'LL TELL YOU I'M INSANE
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I LOVE THE PLAYERS
AND YOU LOVE THE GAME
'CAUSE WE'RE YOUNG AND WE'RE RECKLESS
WE'LL TAKE THIS WAY TOO FAR
IT'LL LEAVE YOU BREATHLESS
OR WITH A NASTY SCAR
GOT A LONG LIST OF EX LOVERS
THEY'LL TELL YOU I'M INSANE
BUT I'VE GOT A BLANK SPACE BABY
AND I'LL WRITE YOUR NAME
CHERRY LIPS CRYSTAL SKIES
I COULD SHOW YOU INCREDIBLE THINGS
STOLEN KISSES PRETTY LIES
YOU'RE THE KING BABY I'M YOUR QUEEN
FIND OUT WHAT YOU WANT
BE THAT GIRL FOR A MONTH
WAIT THE WORST IS YET TO COME OH NO
SCREAMING CRYING PERFECT STORMS
I CAN MAKE ALL THE TABLES TURN
ROSE GARDEN FILLED WITH THORNS
KEEP YOU SECOND GUESSING LIKE
OH MY GOD WHO IS SHE
I GET DRUNK ON JEALOUSY
BUT YOU'LL COME BACK EACH TIME YOU LEAVE
'CAUSE DARLING I'M A NIGHTMARE DRESSED LIKE A DAYDREAM
SO IT'S GONNA BE FOREVER
OR IT'S GONNA GO DOWN IN FLAMES
YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER
IF THE HIGH WAS WORTH THE PAIN
GOT A LONG LIST OF EX LOVERS
THEY'LL TELL YOU I'M INSANE
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I LOVE THE PLAYERS
AND YOU LOVE THE GAME
'CAUSE WE'RE YOUNG AND WE'RE RECKLESS
WE'LL TAKE THIS WAY TOO FAR
IT'LL LEAVE YOU BREATHLESS
OR WITH A NASTY SCAR
GOT A LONG LIST OF EX LOVERS
THEY'LL TELL YOU I'M INSANE
BUT I'VE GOT A BLANK SPACE BABY
AND I'LL WRITE YOUR NAME
BOYS ONLY WANT LOVE IF IT'S TORTURE
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YA
BOYS ONLY WANT LOVE IF IT'S TORTURE
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YA
SO IT'S GONNA BE FOREVER
OR IT'S GONNA GO DOWN IN FLAMES
YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER
IF THE HIGH WAS WORTH THE PAIN
GOT A LONG LIST OF EX LOVERS
THEY'LL TELL YOU I'M INSANE
'CAUSE YOU KNOW I LOVE THE PLAYERS
AND YOU LOVE THE GAME
'CAUSE WE'RE YOUNG AND WE'RE RECKLESS
WE'LL TAKE THIS WAY TOO FAR
IT'LL LEAVE YOU BREATHLESS
OR WITH A NASTY SCAR
GOT A LONG LIST OF EX LOVERS
